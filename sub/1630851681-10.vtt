00:05.339 --> 00:06.340
<i>Previously on</i> Hightown...

00:06.374 --> 00:07.441
Stop! Put your hands up!

00:07.475 --> 00:08.576
<i>We got Charmaine.</i>

00:08.609 --> 00:10.077
I ain't saying nothing
without my attorney.

00:10.111 --> 00:12.012
Don't fuck with
the New Beige girl, right?

00:12.046 --> 00:13.347
I'm gonna walk out of here a free man,

00:13.381 --> 00:16.584
and the first thing I'm gonna
do is knock on your door,

00:16.617 --> 00:17.785
and you're gonna invite me in.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.120
Motherfucker, you high?

00:19.153 --> 00:20.154
Shit!

00:20.187 --> 00:21.589
I want my job back.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.125
I can bring in Frankie Cuevas
and a direct line to New York.

00:24.158 --> 00:27.395
Take out the trash and be
on a plane to Jamaica tomorrow.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.597
- Are you a fucking cop?
- I am.

00:29.630 --> 00:33.534
So cut me another line, or your
degenerate ass is under arrest.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.137
That address, you're gonna
find bodies shot dead

00:36.170 --> 00:37.805
<i>by Frankie Cuevas.</i>

00:38.038 --> 00:39.106
<i>It's Daisy.</i>

00:39.140 --> 00:41.242
We got another one!
<i>Jorge Cuevas.</i>

00:41.275 --> 00:43.177
Frankie Cuevas,
you're under arrest for murder.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.478
You did your cousin dirty.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.213
Couldn't even dig him
a proper grave.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.082
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

This means
we got him for murder, right?

02:36.323 --> 02:39.493
- We got motherfucking Frankie.

02:39.527 --> 02:42.596
We don't got shit
till the jury says we do.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.931
But, yeah, we got him.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.333
Chuleta gave him right
the fuck up for killing Daisy.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.168
Supposed to be his boy.

02:48.202 --> 02:51.338
I guess accessory
to murder wasn't his jam.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.407
Now we just got to prove
that Frankie killed Jorge.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.643
That's Body Side's problem.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.545
We got motherfucking
Frankie Cuevas.

02:59.246 --> 03:02.216
I'm proud to say that
today the Cape is a safer place

03:02.249 --> 03:04.218
because of the outstanding work

03:04.251 --> 03:07.755
of the Cape Cod
Interagency Narcotics Unit.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.356
This investigation started

03:09.390 --> 03:11.959
because of an unspeakable tragedy--

03:12.192 --> 03:13.928
three young lives cut short

03:13.961 --> 03:17.831
by the drugs Mr. Cuevas
and Ms. Grasa supplied.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.601
And although we will never
get them back,

03:20.634 --> 03:22.236
these arrests--

03:24.872 --> 03:26.574
Looks like Christmas
came early this year

03:26.607 --> 03:27.942
for the Mass State Police.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.743
Well, I mean, if that's
the case, then ho, ho, ho.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.478
When do I start?

03:31.512 --> 03:32.980
Yeah, well, uh...

03:33.213 --> 03:34.848
I talked to the command staff
about your reinstatement.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.418
But, uh, you know,
there was a little pushback.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.420
I'm--I'm sorry.
What do you mean pushback?

03:39.453 --> 03:41.488
Look, you were always
a great cop, Abruzzo.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.624
That's not--
that's not the issue.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.593
The issue with you is, uh...

03:45.626 --> 03:47.561
<i>Ah, shit, how do I put this?</i>

03:47.595 --> 03:49.563
Ray, it's...
it's the woman thing.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.664
Yeah.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.633
And all you got to do
is, uh, you know,

03:52.666 --> 03:54.635
<i>clean up the mess you made.</i>

03:54.668 --> 03:56.670
You understand?

03:57.871 --> 03:59.473
Loud and clear.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.330
What are you doing here?

04:26.734 --> 04:28.836
I wanted you to hear it
from me.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.339
Ray and I are in love.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.876
And we're moving in together.

04:35.909 --> 04:40.414
My mom will bring Frankie Jr.
to see you as often as she can,

04:40.447 --> 04:43.884
but you and me are over.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.958
I'm sorry.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.961
Sorry for what?

04:53.994 --> 04:56.664
For hurting you.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.833
Are you also sorry for being
a piece-of-shit rat?

04:59.867 --> 05:03.871
Tell me. I want to hear it
from your whore mouth.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.974
Call me a whore again.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.876
You poor, dumb cunt.

05:10.811 --> 05:14.314
You really think
you're gonna be a cop's wife?

05:14.348 --> 05:16.984
You're a white-trash
junkie slut.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.852
And he's using you.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.422
As soon as he gets
his job back,

05:21.455 --> 05:23.857
you'll be out on the street.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.859
Goodbye, Frankie.

05:28.395 --> 05:31.031
Hey.

05:31.065 --> 05:34.368
What you did to me...

05:34.401 --> 05:37.538
you can never come back
from that.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.006
For the rest
of your fucking life,

05:39.039 --> 05:40.808
you're gonna be looking
over your shoulder.

05:40.841 --> 05:44.344
And one day I'll be there.

05:49.516 --> 05:54.054
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

06:09.470 --> 06:12.606
All dressed up
and nowhere to go.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.141
Hearing didn't go
your way, huh?

06:14.374 --> 06:17.878
Spiteful motherfuckers set
my bail at a million in cash.

06:17.911 --> 06:21.615
How the fuck is that
any of your business anyway?

06:21.648 --> 06:25.119
Everything that happens
up in here's my business.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.621
I know it all.

06:27.654 --> 06:31.058
I know your boy
Frankie's on the inside now.

06:31.091 --> 06:34.595
And I know he sent someone
to run up on you a while back.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.430
Hmm?

06:39.433 --> 06:41.902
Then maybe you and I
can help each other out.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.471
You need protection.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.706
Exactly.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.680
You think I'm siding with you
over Frankie Cuevas?

06:53.714 --> 06:56.984
Get the hell out of here,
punk-ass bitch.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.719
Go on, get.

07:00.487 --> 07:01.488
Fuck!

07:01.522 --> 07:02.956
Damn, bro. What's up?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.594
Fucking screws
trying to play me.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.596
Cops trying to play me.

07:09.630 --> 07:10.998
I gave them everything
they asked for,

07:11.031 --> 07:13.667
and my ass is still inside.

07:13.700 --> 07:14.835
Hmm.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.642
Fuck you doing?

07:21.675 --> 07:23.977
I fucked up.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.180
Popped positive on a piss test.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.150
Sending me to the other side.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.987
Damn, dude.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.623
I'm sorry.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.862
In checkers, when you get
to the end of the board,

07:41.895 --> 07:43.230
you say, "King me."

07:45.065 --> 07:47.801
Right now...

07:47.835 --> 07:50.537
you at the end of the board.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.706
What if we expand?

07:54.141 --> 07:57.211
You take maroon. I take green.

07:57.244 --> 08:00.948
I don't know. I ain't never
been in charge of shit before.

08:00.981 --> 08:05.052
Motherfucker, I ain't
saying that to be generous.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.858
I'm saying it 'cause
I know you a soldier,

08:10.891 --> 08:13.694
that you can handle your shit.

08:15.128 --> 08:19.900
We set this up right,
you can have anything you want.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.235
Yeah?

08:21.268 --> 08:24.705
You want some product
of your own? Done.

08:24.738 --> 08:28.208
You want to smash your girl?
Say when.

08:30.244 --> 08:32.679
Fuck it, then. King me.

08:32.713 --> 08:36.717
It won't gonna be that easy.
It's gonna be work.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.619
And now Frankie's over there.

08:41.555 --> 08:44.892
You gonna have
to earn that crown.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.599
Hey.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.301
You see LT's speech on TV?

08:54.534 --> 08:55.802
We're the fucking shit.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.071
Yeah, we are.
And you should be proud.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.740
You've only been
full-time a month,

08:59.773 --> 09:01.575
and you just made
the case of a lifetime.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.810
- I'm so jealous, I could die.

09:03.844 --> 09:04.945
I do what I do.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.680
We should grab
that drink tonight

09:06.713 --> 09:08.615
and get a bite
or something to celebrate.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.083
Yeah, yeah. We should.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.718
Cool.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.263
<i>Hey!
Can you open the door?</i>

09:23.297 --> 09:24.831
Yeah. Hey, I'm coming.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.836
Oh, okay. I got you. I got you.

09:29.870 --> 09:33.106
Thank you.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.274
Okay, I'll get this.

09:34.308 --> 09:35.642
Yeah.

09:38.312 --> 09:41.148
How'd it go with Frankie?

09:41.181 --> 09:42.182
Fine.

09:44.718 --> 09:45.852
Fine?

09:45.886 --> 09:47.587
- Yeah.
- What'd he say?

09:47.621 --> 09:50.190
Well, what do you think?
He... he called me a cunt.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.959
Motherfucker. Fuck him.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.694
Okay, okay.

09:53.727 --> 09:58.632
Well, I'm the asshole
who made a baby with him, so...

09:58.665 --> 10:00.167
You know he can't
hurt you now.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.602
Yeah.

10:02.636 --> 10:06.006
But you and me,
we got each other, right?

10:06.039 --> 10:09.743
Yeah.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.985
Can we sit down?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.252
There's...

10:19.286 --> 10:22.189
there's something I need
to talk to you about.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.827
Yeah. Of course.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.365
Okay.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.234
- Okay.
- What's up?

10:34.267 --> 10:35.836
Um...

10:38.872 --> 10:42.642
...so I have to ask...

10:42.676 --> 10:46.146
do you think you...

10:46.179 --> 10:49.983
might ever want more kids?

10:50.017 --> 10:52.719
Oh, my God. Yes.

10:52.753 --> 10:56.690
All I've ever wanted was, like,
just one big family.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.859
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:58.892 --> 11:02.229
It'd be me and you and just
a bunch of little rug rats

11:02.262 --> 11:03.964
- running around.
- Yeah.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.700
That is...

11:06.733 --> 11:09.736
so good to hear,
because...

11:09.770 --> 11:11.138
But, you know,
in order to do that,

11:11.171 --> 11:15.242
I got to be a provider,
so I got to get my job back.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.044
You know what I'm saying?

11:23.250 --> 11:25.218
What does that mean?

11:28.922 --> 11:31.758
It means I need you to recant
your statement against me.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.961
So you want me to lie?

11:34.995 --> 11:37.798
Well, I mean,
you did it before already.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.067
I didn't lie, okay?

11:40.100 --> 11:41.334
I...

11:41.368 --> 11:43.470
I told a secret.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.741
Really?

11:49.709 --> 11:52.946
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.748
I shouldn't have even
brought this up right now.

11:54.781 --> 11:57.250
I just... I'm...

11:57.284 --> 11:59.086
I'm at a loss here.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.422
I just need your help,
that's all.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.129
Yeah.

12:11.465 --> 12:13.967
Yeah, of course.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.936
I'll do whatever you need.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.471
Really?

12:17.504 --> 12:19.139
Why wouldn't I?

12:21.141 --> 12:22.809
You're my guy.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.279
<i>So I am the one</i>

12:26.313 --> 12:27.948
<i>who steals the Twizzlers
from the break room,</i>

12:27.981 --> 12:29.983
<i>but I'll show you
my secret stash.</i>

12:30.016 --> 12:32.986
- Thank you.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.121
You're welcome.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.956
What would I do without you?

12:40.327 --> 12:44.297
So I was thinking, and, uh...

12:46.967 --> 12:49.102
...you were right.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.504
Right about what?

12:52.105 --> 12:54.307
I was scared.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.443
That's why
I ended things with you.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.179
Oh...

12:59.212 --> 13:02.082
so we're having
that conversation?

13:02.115 --> 13:04.050
I mean, I'm 35 years old.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.186
I was married,
for Christ's sakes,

13:06.219 --> 13:10.824
and then suddenly I'm gay?

13:10.857 --> 13:13.827
It's like, what?

13:13.860 --> 13:18.098
Uh, it was just
a lot to figure out.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.201
I'm not gonna lie.
You kind of fucked me up.

13:21.234 --> 13:25.572
Also, I know I'm intense.
I get it.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.974
We're cool.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.809
I'm glad we're cool.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.182
<i>♪ It's raining men ♪</i>

13:35.215 --> 13:36.983
- Hello.
<i>♪ Hallelujah ♪</i>

13:37.017 --> 13:39.953
That's my mom's ringtone,
and that is my mom.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.054
- Oh.
- That's a cool thing

13:41.087 --> 13:42.088
- that happened.
- It's... it's fine.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.123
It's fine.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.524
She's not gonna stop
calling me.

13:44.558 --> 13:46.126
Yeah, no, no, no.
Get it, get it.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.994
I got to pee anyway.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.496
Uh, all right, I'm sorry.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.064
Yeah, no problem.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.367
Hello, Fran.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.506
Excuse me,
are you in line or...

13:59.539 --> 14:01.107
Mm.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.576
Dr. Larkin.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.545
It's Jackie Quinones,

14:05.579 --> 14:06.980
from Glendon House.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.348
Hello, Jackie.
Nice to see you again.

14:08.381 --> 14:11.885
Yeah, you too. I'm still sober.

14:11.918 --> 14:13.587
I'm doing... I'm doing
pretty good, actually.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.890
- Yeah.
- I'm so glad to hear that.

14:16.923 --> 14:19.392
I work with State Police now.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.395
Yeah, that big arrest on TV--
Frankie Cuevas?

14:22.429 --> 14:24.331
That was me.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.067
I'm very happy
for all your success, Jackie.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.102
But I'm really not supposed
to talk to patients

14:29.135 --> 14:30.637
outside of therapy.

14:36.977 --> 14:40.313
It's always good to see
former patients doing so well.

14:40.347 --> 14:44.084
You're obviously working the
program, and it's paying off.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.585
Yeah.

14:45.619 --> 14:47.520
Nice to see you.

14:47.554 --> 14:50.090
You too.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.099
You okay?

14:59.132 --> 15:02.102
Did something happen
in the bathroom?

15:02.135 --> 15:04.337
You ever feel like a fraud,

15:04.371 --> 15:06.206
like you're just waiting
for everyone to realize

15:06.239 --> 15:07.607
you're a piece of shit?

15:09.109 --> 15:11.177
Honestly, no.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.281
Yeah. Of course you don't.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.348
Ah, I'm fine.

15:15.382 --> 15:18.685
I just saw someone
I used to know.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.923
So...

15:25.992 --> 15:28.662
...was there something else you
wanted to say back there or...

15:28.695 --> 15:29.996
Not really.

15:31.564 --> 15:32.565
Okay.

15:34.034 --> 15:37.370
I mean, fuck talking, right?

16:07.534 --> 16:09.002
...on the count!

16:16.176 --> 16:18.311
Pack it up.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.246
I didn't fucking do anything.
Where am I going?

16:20.280 --> 16:22.982
Wherever you want.
Your bail's been paid.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.346
How the fuck you make bail?

16:53.380 --> 16:57.083
That's between me
and my attorney.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.685
I don't got to tell you shit.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.388
Feeling yourself, huh?

17:01.421 --> 17:04.457
Like you played the system?
Like you played me?

17:04.491 --> 17:06.226
We're not done.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.794
We had a deal.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.064
And that deal's not over
until I fucking say it's over.

17:11.097 --> 17:15.068
I think it was you tried
to play me.

17:15.101 --> 17:17.771
You were never gonna
let my ass up out of there.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.609
But you can't keep
a real one down.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.746
You know what?

17:26.780 --> 17:29.315
You're right.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.684
I don't want you out,

17:31.718 --> 17:34.254
'cause you're a criminal

17:34.287 --> 17:38.625
and the worst kind of criminal
at that, a snitch...

17:39.793 --> 17:43.430
...an asshole who thinks
he's got a friend in blue.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.599
Well, I'm here to let you know
we're not fucking friends.

17:46.633 --> 17:49.736
You fuck up one time,
and I'ma put your ass

17:49.769 --> 17:52.439
back in there for good,

17:52.472 --> 17:54.140
just like your girl Charmaine.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.360
Turning your back on me?

18:14.394 --> 18:17.096
You better watch
that fucking back.

18:17.130 --> 18:20.366
Don't worry about me, Sarge.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.136
You need to worry
about your own damn self.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.472
Is that a threat?

18:25.505 --> 18:27.841
Fuck around and find out.

18:38.384 --> 18:40.286
Good morning.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.654
Good morning to you.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.691
Excuse me. I'm just gonna
get my favorite mug.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.126
It's right here.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.862
You do anything fun last night?

18:48.895 --> 18:51.898
- I did. I went out for drinks.
- Mm.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.167
I might go again tonight.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.769
Oh, yeah? I'm in.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.872
<i>Babcock! Quinones!</i>

19:07.447 --> 19:09.816
- Hey.
What's up, Sarge?

19:09.849 --> 19:11.484
Charmaine Grasa's
being transferred

19:11.518 --> 19:14.153
to the women's facility
in Framingham on Thursday.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.689
I want you guys
to transport her.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.291
Why us?

19:18.324 --> 19:20.860
Because this is our last shot
at getting her to cooperate.

19:20.894 --> 19:23.263
DA's trying to stack charges
against Frankie Cuevas,

19:23.296 --> 19:25.932
and we don't have him on the
narcotics without Charmaine.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.567
And if she's willing
to talk about New York

19:27.600 --> 19:29.269
while she's at it,
I'll take that, too.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.371
With all due respect,
she hasn't talked yet.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.672
And she's lawyered up.
It's just...

19:32.705 --> 19:34.207
That seems like
a waste of time.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.342
You afraid
of a long drive there, Trooper?

19:36.376 --> 19:37.610
No, sir.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.412
<i>Then you two pick
her up Thursday morning.</i>

19:39.445 --> 19:40.547
<i>You got it, boss.</i>

19:40.580 --> 19:42.482
That'll be all.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.620
<i>Ms. Segna,</i>

19:47.654 --> 19:49.722
<i>is it true
that when Sergeant Abruzzo</i>

19:49.756 --> 19:51.424
first approached you,
he solicited you

19:51.457 --> 19:52.592
for prostitution?

19:53.927 --> 19:55.895
- No.
<i>-That's odd.</i>

19:55.929 --> 19:58.631
I took those words
from your original statement.

19:58.665 --> 20:01.634
Well, is it true
that he leveraged his position

20:01.668 --> 20:03.403
as a police officer
to pressure you

20:03.436 --> 20:05.605
into an intimate relationship?

20:05.638 --> 20:07.407
No. That's not what happened.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.609
Do you understand that there
are consequences

20:09.642 --> 20:11.244
for lying to the police?

20:11.277 --> 20:13.279
<i>Ms. Segna gave information</i>

20:13.313 --> 20:15.848
that led to the arrest
of several high-value targets.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.651
As a result,
she was given immunity.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.486
Please don't make idle threats.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.422
Oh, but it's true.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.757
I did lie.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.926
And that's why I'm here now...

20:26.960 --> 20:29.596
to set the record straight.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.297
Why did you lie?

20:32.799 --> 20:36.603
I lied because Frankie Cuevas

20:36.636 --> 20:41.307
said that if I didn't do
exactly what he told me to do,

20:41.341 --> 20:42.976
he was gonna kill me.

20:44.577 --> 20:48.648
I lied because
I was afraid for my life...

20:50.283 --> 20:52.986
...and I was afraid
for my son's life.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.924
I lied because I had no choice.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.796
Ray Abruzzo...

21:03.830 --> 21:06.532
did not coerce me in any way.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.836
I seduced him,
and I was relentless.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.340
He was nothing but good to me.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.845
And then I let Frankie
ruin him.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.682
I ruined him.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.653
Thank you for your honesty.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.302
- Hey, hey.
<i>Hey.</i>

21:43.336 --> 21:45.538
- How did it go?
- Well...

21:47.607 --> 21:50.343
-...I crushed it.

21:50.376 --> 21:52.311
I, uh...
I cried and everything.

21:52.345 --> 21:53.446
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.015
Told them Frankie
made me do it.

21:56.049 --> 21:57.850
What'd they say?

21:57.884 --> 21:59.752
Mm...

21:59.786 --> 22:04.357
all you need to know
is that I took care of it.

22:04.390 --> 22:06.693
I took care...

22:06.726 --> 22:07.760
of you.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.498
And now...

22:12.532 --> 22:14.567
I want you
to take care of me.

22:15.768 --> 22:18.738
What are you doing? Hmm?

22:18.771 --> 22:20.406
Don't you like it?

22:22.608 --> 22:24.644
I didn't know you talking
to the DA

22:24.677 --> 22:26.379
would make you
so fucking horny.

22:26.412 --> 22:28.781
Mm.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.088
My man's a cop.

22:37.757 --> 22:38.925
And that's hot.

22:41.461 --> 22:44.464
Mm.

22:44.497 --> 22:45.898
I'm not a cop yet, baby.

22:45.932 --> 22:47.133
You sure?

22:47.366 --> 22:48.634
Feels like you are.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.566
Answer it.

23:23.669 --> 23:25.538
Yeah, it's Abruzzo.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.107
Yes, sir.

23:31.911 --> 23:35.414
Yes, sir.
I'll be right over.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.418
Baby, we did it.

23:39.452 --> 23:42.088
We did it?

23:53.699 --> 23:55.168
Hey, I don't mean
to interrupt, but, uh...

23:55.201 --> 23:57.737
- Come on in.
- Take a seat.

24:00.907 --> 24:04.010
Well, the paperwork is still
being processed, but, uh...

24:05.912 --> 24:07.079
...what the hell?

24:09.515 --> 24:11.851
Congratulations, Sergeant.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.022
Sergeant.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.793
Getting my stripes back?

24:20.827 --> 24:23.162
Oh, I can't have my task force
headed up by a scrub, can I?

24:23.196 --> 24:24.597
Task force?

24:24.630 --> 24:26.499
We're setting up
on the New York connect,

24:26.532 --> 24:27.800
scoop the DEA.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.802
That's fantastic.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.137
Don't let me down, now.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.639
I went to bat for you,
and I expect big things.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.575
You're gonna get 'em, sir.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.610
All right, Andy,
I leave it to you.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.682
I'm on it, sir.

24:42.715 --> 24:45.017
Keep your nose clean, Ray.

24:51.023 --> 24:53.492
I know this is strange
meeting this way,

24:53.526 --> 24:55.561
but I just want you to know
that I appreciate--

24:55.595 --> 24:56.929
Just stop.

24:56.963 --> 24:59.966
Whatever voodoo bullshit
you pulled on Markson

24:59.999 --> 25:03.102
and everyone else,
it won't work on me.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.538
Just know time off
did me some good.

25:05.571 --> 25:07.707
I'm a new man.

25:07.740 --> 25:10.610
As soon as the paper clears,
you're back.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.214
Thank you, sir.
I won't let you down.

25:15.248 --> 25:18.618
One more thing...

25:18.651 --> 25:20.887
Since you're back at Sergeant,
Saintille's out.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.256
I think you should be
the one to tell him.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.758
- What?
- We're only budgeted for one.

25:25.791 --> 25:27.260
Luckily, there's a spot
on the Body Side,

25:27.293 --> 25:29.061
so he's moving over.

25:29.095 --> 25:31.197
He should be in his office.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.000
I'm sure he'd rather hear it
from his old partner.

25:49.615 --> 25:50.683
<i>Hey, bud.</i>

25:50.716 --> 25:52.551
Hey, Ray Abruzzo, huh?

25:54.153 --> 25:56.722
Let me guess,
fucking did it, huh?

25:56.756 --> 25:57.957
Got your job back, right?

25:57.990 --> 26:00.092
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Something like that,

26:00.126 --> 26:02.762
something like that.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.931
I'm coming back
as Sergeant, Alan.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.299
Congrats.

26:06.332 --> 26:07.867
And you're going
to Body Side.

26:15.141 --> 26:16.776
- What the fuck?
- It's not a demotion.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.611
It's not a demotion,
Alan, okay?

26:18.644 --> 26:21.580
You're still Sergeant.
It's a great fucking post.

26:21.614 --> 26:22.615
Wait.

26:22.648 --> 26:25.084
You fuck up and get fired

26:25.117 --> 26:27.987
and come back
at the same fucking level?

26:29.989 --> 26:31.590
That sounds about white.

26:33.159 --> 26:34.860
Ten years!

26:34.894 --> 26:38.030
Ten years I been on Dirty Side!
I built a fucking career here!

26:38.064 --> 26:39.699
But who gives a shit
about that?

26:39.732 --> 26:42.168
Not you! Not fucking Smith!

26:42.201 --> 26:44.737
Fucking expendable Alan!

26:44.770 --> 26:46.339
This some bullshit.

26:48.674 --> 26:50.710
I really wonder
what the fuck the difference is

26:50.743 --> 26:52.244
between me and you.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.679
Bro, it's not like that.

26:53.713 --> 26:54.981
Bro?

26:55.014 --> 26:57.750
Motherfucker, do you know
the quality of life

26:57.783 --> 26:59.051
on fucking Homicide?

26:59.085 --> 27:01.153
There's four detectives

27:01.187 --> 27:05.324
to cover every unattended body
on the goddamn Cape!

27:05.358 --> 27:07.326
They call you any time
day or fucking night.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.061
You see the worst
of the goddamn worst.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.764
And you got to make
whatever fucking shitty case

27:11.797 --> 27:14.200
that lands
on your goddamn desk!

27:14.233 --> 27:17.003
So it is like that, bro.

27:19.205 --> 27:20.940
I can't fucking believe
this shit.

27:20.973 --> 27:21.974
Right.

27:24.877 --> 27:28.014
Whoa, hey, hey.
What are you doing? Alan.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.749
You want your goddamn office
back, right?

27:29.782 --> 27:31.183
<i>-Hey, hey.</i>
- Shit.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.152
- Fuck.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.254
You know it doesn't have
to be this way.

27:35.287 --> 27:38.157
You're right. It doesn't.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.894
And knowing you,
it won't be this way for long.

27:43.829 --> 27:46.032
Keep it warm for me, Ray.

27:53.806 --> 27:56.709
You wasn't doing that
at physical therapy.

27:56.742 --> 27:58.844
Yeah, well, I needed that.

27:58.878 --> 28:01.847
- You needed it?

28:05.818 --> 28:07.887
I like this.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.889
Hmm.

28:09.922 --> 28:12.058
I like this a lot.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.429
No, baby.

28:18.731 --> 28:21.901
I can't. I got to take this.
I'm sorry.

28:32.945 --> 28:33.946
Yeah.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.317
Yeah, I know who this is.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.920
And I know you put up
for my bail.

28:42.254 --> 28:45.391
Yeah, I could get down
to New York.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.760
Shit, I was born ready.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.998
What was that about?

28:54.967 --> 28:56.469
You really want to know?

28:56.502 --> 28:57.903
If we're gonna do this,

28:57.937 --> 29:00.306
I need to know
what I'm getting myself into.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.309
All right.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.947
Well, how about we go
for round two,

29:07.980 --> 29:09.815
then I tell you everything?

29:21.961 --> 29:23.996
<i>Eddie Murphy.</i>

29:25.431 --> 29:28.000
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

29:28.033 --> 29:29.969
- So what'd you do this time?
<i>-Nothing.</i>

29:30.002 --> 29:31.170
I went to Dibby's,
and I happened to have

29:31.203 --> 29:32.938
an extra 99 cents in my pocket.

29:32.972 --> 29:35.941
And I wanted to see you
and the boat one last time.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.443
You miss it?

29:37.476 --> 29:40.312
Yeah. Of course I do.

29:40.346 --> 29:41.380
Will you?

29:41.413 --> 29:44.216
Probably. Yeah.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.085
<i>But fuck it.</i>

29:46.118 --> 29:48.087
I hear you got your bad guy.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.924
Yeah. Thanks, thanks.
It feels good, you know?

29:51.957 --> 29:53.259
I'm not just Crazy Jackie.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.827
Like, I can do
good things, too.

29:54.860 --> 29:57.563
Hey, I'm the only one
gets to call you crazy.

30:00.466 --> 30:01.934
Okay.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.136
So, uh, they're doing
this little retirement thing

30:04.170 --> 30:05.504
for me tomorrow.

30:05.538 --> 30:08.040
Um, can you make it?

30:08.073 --> 30:09.909
Uh, I mean, I got to...

30:09.942 --> 30:13.312
I got to check with my lady,
see if we're free.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.281
Hey, I'm fucking with you.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.184
Yeah, I wouldn't miss it
for anything. Come on.

30:24.223 --> 30:27.092
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, too.

30:40.873 --> 30:43.609
- My man. Looking good.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.344
- I've been expecting you.

30:45.377 --> 30:47.846
Yeah. I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.115
I mean, you, me, here...

30:50.149 --> 30:52.418
it's like the natural order
has been restored.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.223
- How's Renee?
- That's actually why I came.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.892
See, you and I both know you're
not getting out this time.

30:59.925 --> 31:02.561
So whatever little bullshit
threat you made to Renee,

31:02.595 --> 31:04.897
that's just you trying
to make yourself feel big.

31:04.930 --> 31:09.335
But she's a cop's girl now,
which means she's off-limits.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.104
And if you got threats,
you come to me.

31:12.137 --> 31:13.138
I got no beef with you.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.440
You know, I can't blame

31:14.473 --> 31:17.243
another man for falling
for the same shit as I did.

31:17.276 --> 31:20.112
She's a pretty girl.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.348
But how well
do you know her really?

31:22.381 --> 31:24.016
Do you know she used
to be a drug addict?

31:24.049 --> 31:25.417
I mean, are cops
even allowed to shack up

31:25.451 --> 31:27.052
with pill-popping
junkie whores?

31:27.086 --> 31:28.520
Watch your fucking mouth.

31:28.554 --> 31:31.624
Jorge underestimated her
and look what happened to him.

31:31.657 --> 31:34.560
Even I didn't see that coming.

31:34.593 --> 31:37.096
Oh, it's true.

31:37.129 --> 31:41.433
And with the piece I gave her
to protect herself at the club.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.435
Now they're charging me
with my own cousin's murder

31:43.469 --> 31:46.905
on top of those three kids
I had nothing to do with.

31:48.574 --> 31:52.111
But I guess that's on me
for trusting a murderous <i>puta.</i>

31:56.315 --> 31:57.650
See you at your trial, Frankie.

31:57.683 --> 32:01.954
In the meantime,
stay the fuck away from Renee.

32:01.987 --> 32:04.957
Bitch played you for a chump...

32:04.990 --> 32:06.625
again.

32:17.169 --> 32:18.337
Oh, shit.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.479
Oh, it's you.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.415
Yeah. What, you expecting
someone else?

32:29.448 --> 32:31.116
- Yes, actually.

32:31.150 --> 32:32.151
What's up?

32:35.421 --> 32:37.589
I got my job back.
That's what's up.

32:37.623 --> 32:38.957
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

32:38.991 --> 32:40.659
I talked to
Lieutenant Smith last night.

32:40.693 --> 32:42.428
I'm coming back as Sergeant.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.463
Sergeant? So what,
you and Alan are both--

32:44.496 --> 32:46.298
Oh, he's going over
to Body Side.

32:47.499 --> 32:50.235
It's a lateral move.
It's no big deal.

32:50.269 --> 32:52.004
I thought you two were friends.

32:52.037 --> 32:55.507
He's fine.
He would do the same to me.

32:55.541 --> 32:56.709
Mm.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.647
All right,
well, look, anyway, um...

33:01.680 --> 33:04.049
I'm putting together
this New York task force.

33:05.718 --> 33:08.387
Are you...
are you asking me to be on it?

33:08.420 --> 33:10.189
Jesus, why do you got to make
things so fucking difficult,

33:10.222 --> 33:12.524
Jackie?

33:12.558 --> 33:15.361
Will you be
on my New York task force?

33:15.394 --> 33:17.496
Please?

33:17.529 --> 33:19.531
Sure.

33:19.565 --> 33:21.734
That why you came by?

33:21.767 --> 33:24.269
And one other thing...

33:24.303 --> 33:27.706
What specifically do you know
about Jorge Cuevas' murder?

33:27.740 --> 33:29.141
Why?

33:29.174 --> 33:30.409
Don't worry about it.

33:32.644 --> 33:35.214
All right.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.384
Ballistics came back
with a match on the .38

33:38.417 --> 33:41.153
Frankie had on him when
we picked him up at the club.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.021
And Jorge was buried
at the same place

33:43.055 --> 33:44.757
as Daisy and the pilot.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.325
- But...
- But what?

33:46.358 --> 33:48.460
Yeah. I don't know, man,
it's weird.

33:48.494 --> 33:51.764
Chuleta spilled about Daisy,
but he swears up and down

33:51.797 --> 33:53.532
that Frankie
wouldn't have killed Jorge.

33:53.565 --> 33:55.467
And they never found
a crime scene.

34:00.606 --> 34:04.076
Hey.

34:04.109 --> 34:06.378
Hi, Les.

34:06.412 --> 34:09.114
Leslie, Ray just said that
he's coming back as Sergeant,

34:09.148 --> 34:12.317
so we're all gonna be
working together soon.

34:14.620 --> 34:17.055
That's great. Congratulations.

34:21.326 --> 34:23.429
Okay, I'm out of here.

34:23.462 --> 34:26.098
Hey, Ray.

34:26.131 --> 34:28.600
No hard feelings, right?

34:28.634 --> 34:30.736
Sure.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.408
What the fuck?

34:36.442 --> 34:38.277
I know. I know. I know.
It's crazy.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.546
After everything,
after all that shit

34:40.579 --> 34:43.248
he brought down
on the department...

34:43.282 --> 34:46.785
Must be nice to be a dude,
just fail your way to the top.

34:46.819 --> 34:49.788
- Are you happy?

34:49.822 --> 34:51.723
I can't help it. I like him.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.626
That's because you're just
a big old softie.

34:56.662 --> 34:59.465
- Am I?
- Very, very soft.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.718
- Hey, buddy.
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:19.751 --> 35:21.620
I'm Sergeant Ray Abruzzo,
State Police.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.455
Let me ask you a question.

35:23.489 --> 35:26.758
Have you seen this girl, came
in right before Thanksgiving,

35:26.792 --> 35:28.360
would have looked
a little better than this?

35:28.393 --> 35:29.895
- Yeah. I remember her.
- You do?

35:30.128 --> 35:31.763
Mm, not too many chicks
come in here,

35:31.797 --> 35:35.767
none that look like that,
but, uh, she was looney tunes.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.669
Tried to buy one bullet,
like this is

35:37.703 --> 35:40.305
some kind of fucking
candy store or something.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.241
You remember what type
of bullet?

35:42.274 --> 35:43.775
.38 caliber.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.858
<i>You hear Osito got out
the other day?</i>

35:59.892 --> 36:03.695
He must have given up something
big, 'cause he made bail.

36:03.729 --> 36:07.199
- Think it was you?
- Fuck off.

36:07.232 --> 36:09.334
I'm just thinking
out loud here,

36:09.368 --> 36:13.305
but what if, after
everything's said and done,

36:13.338 --> 36:15.574
you're the one left
holding the bag?

36:17.709 --> 36:19.711
We know you've been through
a lot, Charmaine,

36:19.745 --> 36:22.247
everything with your sister...

36:22.281 --> 36:23.682
it's horrible.

36:23.715 --> 36:26.184
<i>And I get it.</i>

36:27.920 --> 36:29.655
I even respect you
for not talking.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.822
It's honorable.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.391
Fuck honor.

36:32.424 --> 36:36.528
You really want to do time
for Frankie Cuevas?

36:36.562 --> 36:39.398
<i>You think he'd do
the same for you?</i>

36:39.431 --> 36:40.899
<i>We know you were
bringing the package</i>

36:40.933 --> 36:43.735
to Frankie when we caught you
on the bridge.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.938
Look, all you got to do
is get with your lawyer,

36:45.971 --> 36:47.739
tell him you want
to sign a statement

36:47.773 --> 36:50.275
and work off your case,
that's it.

36:50.309 --> 36:53.245
<i>All right, look,
I'll make it easier for you.</i>

36:53.278 --> 36:55.213
You can give a statement
about the New York connect

36:55.247 --> 36:56.515
or Frankie Cuevas.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.550
Your other option
is getting tried as an adult

36:58.584 --> 37:00.752
for trafficking, distribution,
and manslaughter,

37:00.786 --> 37:02.454
<i>so your call.</i>

37:05.791 --> 37:08.260
I need a bathroom.

37:08.293 --> 37:10.329
You can hold it.

37:10.362 --> 37:12.931
No, it ain't like that.

37:12.965 --> 37:14.566
I just got my period.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.968
Bullshit.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.848
Just give me a tampon, and I'll
make a statement, all right?

37:29.881 --> 37:33.285
We're not taking you anywhere
but Framingham.

37:33.318 --> 37:34.820
Come on, we're in the middle
of nowhere.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.588
She can go right here.

37:36.622 --> 37:38.991
I got a tampon
in my coat pocket.

38:01.013 --> 38:02.681
Watch your head.

38:05.017 --> 38:07.552
Wait, so I'm just supposed to
do it on the side of the road?

38:07.586 --> 38:08.620
<i>Yes.</i>

38:08.654 --> 38:09.921
With my hands like this?

38:11.556 --> 38:14.559
Stand still.
I'll recuff you in the front.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.529
Okay.

38:17.562 --> 38:18.864
Oh!

38:18.897 --> 38:21.433
Stop! Stop!

38:21.466 --> 38:22.567
Oh!

38:22.601 --> 38:24.036
Stop, Charmaine!
- Fuck, my ankle.

38:24.069 --> 38:26.471
- You okay?
- Fucking go! I'll call it in!

38:32.010 --> 38:33.979
God damn it.

38:38.050 --> 38:40.419
Charmaine!

38:40.452 --> 38:42.521
Stop!

38:42.554 --> 38:44.690
Stop, Charmaine!

39:04.710 --> 39:06.478
Stop!

39:29.668 --> 39:30.836
Shit!

39:34.740 --> 39:35.941
Fuck!

39:47.052 --> 39:50.756
<i>♪ Have yourself

39:50.789 --> 39:53.692
How are you feeling
about meeting my mom?

39:53.725 --> 39:55.794
- Yeah, good.
- Yeah?

39:55.827 --> 39:56.962
You know what?
She can come with us

39:56.995 --> 39:58.764
to pick up
the Christmas tree if you want.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.699
No, no. She's, uh...

40:00.732 --> 40:02.968
she's better in small doses.

40:05.971 --> 40:08.774
It's cool you offered, though.

40:08.807 --> 40:10.475
Frankie hated
spending time with her.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.778

40:14.646 --> 40:17.115
You okay?

40:17.149 --> 40:20.118
You know what?
I just want to start over.

40:20.152 --> 40:23.121
I want to forget
about Frankie.

40:23.155 --> 40:25.457
I want to forget
about the way we met.

40:27.459 --> 40:29.060
And from now on,
we're just two normal people

40:29.094 --> 40:30.729
who fell in love, okay?

40:30.762 --> 40:31.830
Yeah.

40:33.498 --> 40:35.467
Yeah, I like that idea.

40:37.569 --> 40:38.904
But in order to do that,

40:38.937 --> 40:41.139
we can't have secrets
from each other.

40:43.175 --> 40:44.810
I agree.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.147
So I'm only gonna ask you
this once.

40:51.183 --> 40:54.619
Is there anything you need
to tell me right now?

40:55.954 --> 40:57.989
What's this about, Ray?

41:02.027 --> 41:04.863
You can tell me anything.

41:04.896 --> 41:06.631
You know that, right?

41:06.665 --> 41:08.867
<i>I love you so fucking much.</i>

41:12.871 --> 41:14.072
I love you, too.

41:17.542 --> 41:19.678
And there is...

41:19.711 --> 41:22.113
something that I need to tell you.

41:31.056 --> 41:33.024
I'm pregnant.

41:46.071 --> 41:48.073
How long have you known?

41:49.841 --> 41:53.278
Like... a few months.
I don't know.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.080
Jesus.

41:55.113 --> 41:56.815
A few months.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.717
When were you gonna tell me?

42:00.285 --> 42:02.220
I... I don't know.

42:02.254 --> 42:04.556
I... I guess
I was waiting to find out

42:04.589 --> 42:06.057
what was gonna happen
with Frankie.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.762
Do you even know whose it is?

42:15.233 --> 42:17.569
It's yours, asshole.

42:17.602 --> 42:19.905
Why do you think
I'm telling you?

42:19.938 --> 42:22.540
Renee, look at me. You know
why I had to ask, right?

42:22.574 --> 42:24.042
Because you're a dick.

42:24.075 --> 42:26.077
Yeah, okay, you know what?
I deserve that.

42:26.111 --> 42:28.647
You're right. I'm a dick.

42:28.680 --> 42:29.915
But I'm...

42:32.951 --> 42:35.620
But I'm happy.

42:36.955 --> 42:38.757
You are?

42:38.790 --> 42:40.258
Yeah.

43:06.751 --> 43:09.087
What do you think it is?

43:12.123 --> 43:13.591
A girl.

43:20.098 --> 43:22.133
- Oh, my God.

43:24.970 --> 43:28.773
Oh, we're having a baby.
Oh, my God.

43:28.807 --> 43:30.775
We're having a baby.

43:30.809 --> 43:33.812
Mm-hmm.

43:41.853 --> 43:44.222
Is there anything else
you need to tell me?

43:45.991 --> 43:47.792
No.

43:47.826 --> 43:49.361
Okay.

43:58.003 --> 43:59.738
Eight hours they've been
searching the woods,

43:59.771 --> 44:01.172
and nothing.

44:01.206 --> 44:02.874
How does that even happen?

44:02.907 --> 44:06.344
Is she invisible?
Does she have wings?

44:06.378 --> 44:08.246
If you were trying
to end your careers,

44:08.279 --> 44:10.715
you couldn't have found
a better way!

44:13.218 --> 44:15.186
Well, that's what I get
for putting two females

44:15.220 --> 44:16.721
in the field together.

44:16.755 --> 44:19.024
<i>Listen closely.</i>

44:19.057 --> 44:21.426
<i>There's going to be
an investigation.</i>

44:21.659 --> 44:24.029
At 8:00 a.m. sharp, you'll meet
with your union reps,

44:24.062 --> 44:27.132
after which you will give
your official statements.

44:27.165 --> 44:30.035
<i>I'm not psychic,
but I have a vision of you</i>

44:30.068 --> 44:34.039
both riding desks
for the foreseeable future.

44:34.072 --> 44:36.674
And that's
the best-case scenario.

44:38.076 --> 44:40.178
Yeah, okay.
I... I understand, sir.

44:40.211 --> 44:42.247
And I'm sorry.

44:43.748 --> 44:45.383
Permission to speak privately?

44:45.417 --> 44:47.152
<i>We're all friends
here, Trooper.</i>

44:51.022 --> 44:53.224
I would like to state
for the record

44:53.258 --> 44:54.325
that I voiced apprehension

44:54.359 --> 44:56.895
about this mission
from the start.

44:56.928 --> 44:59.197
Sergeant Saintille
arranged for this transfer

44:59.230 --> 45:00.732
under the mistaken idea

45:00.765 --> 45:03.068
that Grasa would speak
without a lawyer present.

45:03.101 --> 45:05.070
But it wasn't approved
by any higher-ups,

45:05.103 --> 45:07.172
and it was clearly not safe.

45:07.205 --> 45:08.440
Is that all?

45:08.473 --> 45:10.408
I would also like to state
for the record

45:10.442 --> 45:12.444
that Agent Quinones
displayed poor judgment

45:12.477 --> 45:14.012
by letting the prisoner
out of the car.

45:14.045 --> 45:16.081
- Excuse me?
- Hey.

45:16.114 --> 45:17.215
Go on.

45:18.450 --> 45:21.252
She displayed
a lack of protocol

45:21.286 --> 45:23.855
by stopping to check on me.

45:23.888 --> 45:26.424
And on top of that,
she has impulse issues...

45:26.458 --> 45:27.926
Fuck this shit.

45:27.959 --> 45:29.260
...which is not surprising,

45:29.294 --> 45:31.129
considering she was brought in
by Ray Abruzzo.

45:31.162 --> 45:33.231
<i>And If I still have a job
after tomorrow,</i>

45:33.264 --> 45:36.167
I will be requesting
a new partner.

45:36.201 --> 45:38.203
<i>Thank you
for sharing, Trooper.</i>

45:38.236 --> 45:40.939
Meeting adjourned.

45:43.475 --> 45:44.976
What the fuck was that?

45:47.479 --> 45:49.447
It's my career.

45:51.850 --> 45:54.052
Hey, Bill. Can you help me?

46:14.305 --> 46:16.074
Fuck!

46:23.414 --> 46:24.849
Fuck.

46:40.465 --> 46:42.333
God damn it.

46:53.444 --> 46:55.547
- Hey.
- Uncle Ray.

46:55.580 --> 46:57.582
Hey, buddy.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.350
Hey.

46:59.384 --> 47:01.386
"Uncle Ray"?

47:01.419 --> 47:04.422
Mom, this is Ray.
Ray, this is my mom, Callie.

47:04.455 --> 47:06.090
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

47:06.124 --> 47:07.825
You guys talk.

47:07.859 --> 47:10.261
I'm gonna go
pack up Frankie's stuff.

47:13.398 --> 47:14.832
Uncle Ray, huh?

48:04.382 --> 48:06.251
Homicide, this is Saintille.

48:06.284 --> 48:08.319
Yeah, this is Officer Mathews,
Boston PD.

48:08.353 --> 48:10.221
<i>Yeah. What you got?</i>

48:10.255 --> 48:12.523
Yeah. So, uh, we got a, uh...

48:12.557 --> 48:15.226
we got a bar fight over here,
something about a female.

48:15.260 --> 48:17.395
You know, the one guy,
Lawrence Almond,

48:17.428 --> 48:20.331
has a Leatherman and just
starts going at the other guy,

48:20.365 --> 48:22.000
just, unh, unh, unh!

48:22.033 --> 48:23.935
You think the, uh, victim's
not gonna make it?

48:23.968 --> 48:26.471
Oh, no. He's fine, fine.
Superficial wounds.

48:26.504 --> 48:29.073
Then what the fuck you call
Homicide for, then?

48:29.107 --> 48:32.310
So Almond is from the Cape,
was just up here for the night.

48:32.343 --> 48:35.146
And as soon as he realized
he was going away for this,

48:35.179 --> 48:39.384
guy lost it, and, uh, he, uh,
started telling some tales.

48:39.417 --> 48:40.451
Yeah?

48:40.485 --> 48:41.619
<i>Says he heard a rumor</i>

48:41.653 --> 48:43.288
about some Jamaican
cleaning ladies

48:43.321 --> 48:45.189
that he used to work with,
that they...

48:45.223 --> 48:48.126
that they buried a body...

48:48.159 --> 48:50.962
<i>some big drug dealer.</i>

48:50.995 --> 48:52.597
Jorge Cuevas?

48:52.630 --> 48:54.599
Uh, yeah, that's the name.

48:54.632 --> 48:57.068
<i>Anyway, just, uh, thought
you should know.</i>

48:57.101 --> 48:58.403
Uh, yeah. Thanks for the call.

48:58.436 --> 49:00.705
Um, I'll head up there tomorrow
and talk to him.

49:00.938 --> 49:02.373
<i>Hey, what's the name
of the place he works?</i>

49:02.407 --> 49:04.142
Uh...

49:04.175 --> 49:09.213
Bayside Cleaners.

49:09.247 --> 49:11.115
Yeah. Thanks a lot, man.

49:11.149 --> 49:12.417
Sure.

49:23.194 --> 49:25.363
Oh, really?
Did you have them...

49:25.396 --> 49:26.597
did you have them
fucking measure it for you?

49:26.631 --> 49:28.199
They tell you at the end.

49:28.232 --> 49:29.634
Well, la-di-da.

49:29.667 --> 49:30.968
<i>Hey!</i>

49:31.002 --> 49:32.603
<i>Look who decided to join us.</i>

49:32.637 --> 49:34.739
If it isn't Grace Kelly,
waltzing in an hour late.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.174
Oh, better late than never.

49:36.207 --> 49:38.009
I'm sorry. Congratulations, Ed.

49:38.042 --> 49:39.344
Oh, thanks.

49:39.377 --> 49:42.013
- You okay?
- Yeah. Fine. Good.

49:42.046 --> 49:43.348
- You sure?
- Yeah.

49:43.381 --> 49:46.084
You don't want to talk
about it?

49:46.117 --> 49:47.685

49:49.554 --> 49:51.189

49:51.222 --> 49:55.360

then, may I have this dance?
