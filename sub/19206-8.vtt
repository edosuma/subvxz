00:00.016 --> 00:01.630
Previously on Switched at Birth...

00:01.650 --> 00:03.487
Chris Walker... 90
mile-an-hour fastball.

00:03.529 --> 00:05.275
There are three scouts
sitting in the stands

00:05.288 --> 00:06.983
waiting to throw money at you.

00:07.013 --> 00:08.557
Turn around, put your
hands on your head now.

00:08.570 --> 00:11.977
My pitching arm! You're
hurting my pitching arm!

00:12.054 --> 00:13.715
You know I had open-heart surgery.

00:13.736 --> 00:16.110
The donor was a man who
died in a car accident.

00:16.356 --> 00:17.901
You have Angelo's heart?

00:17.952 --> 00:19.861
I thought about you every single day.

00:20.028 --> 00:22.130
- You have a girlfriend.
- Maybe I shouldn't.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.217
But you do.

00:23.244 --> 00:25.200
Luca and I are together.

00:25.234 --> 00:28.488
As a father, I have very serious
concerns about your relationship.

00:28.523 --> 00:29.928
Where are you staying now?

00:29.993 --> 00:31.574
- My car.
- Ally!

00:31.579 --> 00:33.262
You could stay with me and Daphne.

00:33.295 --> 00:35.408
You know what? If I am
good enough to steal from,

00:35.430 --> 00:36.661
then I'm good enough
to have my own share.

00:36.661 --> 00:37.876
Congratulations, you've got one.

00:37.892 --> 00:40.576
The rental fee is 300 bucks every week.

00:45.573 --> 00:48.429
- What is this?
- It was mac 'n' cheese.

00:48.504 --> 00:50.810
I didn't know you could burn macaroni.

00:51.607 --> 00:53.785
Apparently if you let
it cook for two hours.

00:54.565 --> 00:57.120
I wanted to thank you for letting
me crash after everything...

00:57.136 --> 01:00.325
Okay, I got your text.
Pizza to the rescue.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.412
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:01.449 --> 01:05.676
It cost me my last $18,

01:05.687 --> 01:08.640
but I have already paid
Noelle for the week.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.925
Man, that feels good to say.

01:12.178 --> 01:16.233
Oh, you guys, I finally have a day off.

01:16.265 --> 01:17.470
So what are the weekend plans?

01:17.535 --> 01:21.052
Definitely not having a
romantic weekend eating scones

01:21.069 --> 01:23.537
in a paddle boat at the
cherry blossom festival.

01:23.564 --> 01:24.936
That was weirdly specific.

01:25.056 --> 01:28.497
I may have checked Mingo's
Instagram a few times.

01:28.561 --> 01:31.186
He's visiting his girlfriend in DC.

01:31.234 --> 01:33.923
I've got to find a way to
stop thinking about him.

01:33.977 --> 01:35.445
Let's go out.

01:35.634 --> 01:37.865
I'm a terrible cook, but
I'm a great wing woman.

01:37.876 --> 01:39.500
We'll snag you a guy by midnight.

01:39.559 --> 01:41.694
Nice of you to offer,
but I'm not really looking

01:41.727 --> 01:43.361
to start a new relationship right now.

01:43.394 --> 01:45.184
Who said anything about a relationship?

01:45.227 --> 01:47.330
I'm talking about a
"Wham, bam, thank you, sir"

01:47.357 --> 01:49.986
to take your mind off,
um... what's his name?

01:50.003 --> 01:52.880
Mingo. And I like the way you think.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.157
Uh, maybe you need a non-starter

01:57.184 --> 01:59.217
for the weekend, just to

01:59.260 --> 02:02.357
cure you of your Mingo-itis.

02:03.627 --> 02:04.982
That's weird.

02:05.923 --> 02:08.155
Bay, did you pay the electric bill?

02:08.699 --> 02:11.044
We have an electric bill?

02:13.959 --> 02:19.025
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:23.834 --> 02:25.302
And there we go.

02:25.512 --> 02:26.700
Candles?

02:26.958 --> 02:29.093
-  This is a joke, right?
- What?

02:29.158 --> 02:31.675
Those are nice tapers, drip-free.

02:31.795 --> 02:34.021
Come on! I'll pay you back.

02:34.037 --> 02:35.811
All I need is a small loan.

02:35.860 --> 02:39.189
I'm sorry, sweetie. The bank of
Kennish is closed for business.

02:39.309 --> 02:41.566
So what are we supposed
to do? Live like Pilgrims?

02:41.582 --> 02:42.996
Of course not.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.169
Pilgrims didn't have running water.

02:45.799 --> 02:49.014
You will spend hundreds of
dollars on Daphne's school books,

02:49.025 --> 02:52.036
but you will not even
lend me the same amount?

02:52.156 --> 02:54.134
You wanted to work
instead of going to college

02:54.145 --> 02:55.995
and that means you
make certain sacrifices.

02:56.022 --> 02:58.291
Like my ability to see at night?

02:58.463 --> 03:00.022
What about your car?

03:00.142 --> 03:01.409
Gas costs money.

03:01.436 --> 03:03.609
You could get a bus pass,
sell that old junker.

03:03.678 --> 03:06.064
That's a good one. That's real funny.

03:06.100 --> 03:07.422
I'm serious, Bay.

03:07.674 --> 03:10.342
If you can't afford your
lifestyle, something's got to give.

03:10.363 --> 03:12.643
I would sooner sell the clothes
off my back than sell that thing.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.220
That car is... is me. That car is art.

03:15.246 --> 03:16.978
That car is never going away.

03:17.011 --> 03:19.614
Well, then you're going to have to
figure out a way to make more money

03:19.645 --> 03:21.803
because you're not getting it here.

03:24.336 --> 03:27.083
Hey, sweetie. Sorry I'm late.

03:27.203 --> 03:30.153
I was imparting life
wisdom upon our offspring.

03:32.426 --> 03:33.623
Sweetie?

03:33.658 --> 03:36.092
The Zimmermans are moving to Denver.

03:36.128 --> 03:38.025
What? Whose butts are we going to kick

03:38.057 --> 03:39.681
at the next Kennish game night?

03:39.735 --> 03:42.660
Sure, joke around. But it's
hard to find good couple friends.

03:42.703 --> 03:45.285
And I feel like we're barely
social anymore as it is.

03:45.322 --> 03:46.624
What about the Barkers?

03:46.672 --> 03:48.361
Divorced, remember?

03:49.152 --> 03:50.814
Um, the Clarks?

03:50.846 --> 03:53.481
Um, on sabbatical in Prague.

03:54.853 --> 03:56.311
Regina and Luca?

03:56.934 --> 03:58.720
Now there's an idea.

03:58.773 --> 04:00.714
We can show them our Parcheesi magic.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.742
You wanted to see me, coach?

04:02.752 --> 04:04.685
Hey, Chris, how you doin'?

04:04.720 --> 04:07.221
Want to make sure you're ready
for your look with the Royals.

04:07.341 --> 04:09.623
We only got one shot to
show 'em what you're made of,

04:09.659 --> 04:13.027
so you have got to bring
everything you've got to the field.

04:13.147 --> 04:16.533
We know that sitting out the
regionals was devastating for you.

04:16.553 --> 04:18.808
But we've got you this far

04:18.834 --> 04:21.358
- and we're not giving up now.
- Thanks, Miss K.

04:21.392 --> 04:24.201
I've been pulling three-a-days
all week getting ready.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.378
Volquez better guard
his spot on the mound,

04:26.395 --> 04:28.813
- 'cause I'm coming for it.
- That's what I want to hear,

04:28.835 --> 04:31.945
'cause you know what? We
are taking you to the majors.

04:35.917 --> 04:37.362
Aw.

04:37.573 --> 04:39.324
Oh, I know.

04:41.188 --> 04:43.189
Come in!

04:44.859 --> 04:46.664
Hey, best mom ever.

04:46.983 --> 04:48.175
Oh, I know that look.

04:48.201 --> 04:49.908
That's the "I need something" look.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.647
Uh, well,

04:53.157 --> 04:55.365
I'm having a teensy-weensy

04:55.399 --> 04:58.492
little electrical-bill,
um, problem, as in,

04:58.768 --> 05:01.643
I have one and I don't
have money to pay it.

05:01.660 --> 05:03.579
Wait, I thought things were
going well at the tattoo parlor?

05:03.579 --> 05:06.130
They are! I just... I have
to pay Noelle a chair fee

05:06.143 --> 05:09.860
and restock my own supplies,
and I'm sort of broke right now.

05:09.924 --> 05:11.603
So I was wondering if you could spot me,

05:11.633 --> 05:14.198
like, just a couple... hundred dollars.

05:14.262 --> 05:16.991
Let me get this straight... you
want me to pay the electric bill

05:17.034 --> 05:20.088
on the apartment that I'm
renting to you for free.

05:20.261 --> 05:21.689
Well, when you put it like that...

05:21.926 --> 05:24.589
When I started out,
nobody gave me anything.

05:24.598 --> 05:27.187
I had to buy my first salon
chair out of the back of a Buick.

05:27.230 --> 05:28.263
It was tough.

05:28.572 --> 05:29.868
But I wouldn't be who I am today

05:29.907 --> 05:31.619
if I'd had it any easier.

05:31.739 --> 05:33.107
So I'm guessing that's a no?

05:34.187 --> 05:35.921
I've got to get to class.

05:35.957 --> 05:39.243
If you're really desperate, I could
always use some help at the Cracked Mug.

05:40.022 --> 05:41.726
You know where I keep the aprons.

05:43.959 --> 05:45.263
Lock up.

05:51.204 --> 05:52.585
A C+?

05:52.705 --> 05:54.262
But I worked so hard.

05:54.267 --> 05:55.424
What did you get?

05:56.008 --> 05:57.756
A-?

05:58.005 --> 06:01.425
You phoned that in 'cause you had
Reserve training last weeken...

06:01.658 --> 06:03.732
You didn't even meet
the minimum page count.

06:03.741 --> 06:06.017
Guess I knew the material
better than I thought.

06:07.330 --> 06:09.992
I gotta run to calc. See you tonight?

06:10.405 --> 06:13.150
Prepare to see a
board-game master in action.

06:20.498 --> 06:23.348
Hey, Lauren, I was wondering
if I could talk to you

06:23.348 --> 06:25.315
about re-reading my paper?

06:25.341 --> 06:27.677
I think you might have missed a section.

06:27.741 --> 06:29.282
I read it very thoroughly.

06:29.342 --> 06:33.269
Well, then you must know how
comprehensive my research was.

06:33.282 --> 06:35.428
I think I deserve better than a C.

06:35.695 --> 06:37.373
I don't change grades.

06:37.428 --> 06:40.282
But if you want to talk about
how you can do better next time,

06:40.346 --> 06:42.248
I have office hours next week.

06:44.851 --> 06:47.742
And then the professor called
me out for being on my phone,

06:47.759 --> 06:49.377
but I didn't realize
he was talking to me

06:49.377 --> 06:53.091
because I was too busy
checking Mingo's "Insta" again.

06:53.431 --> 06:54.738
I'm losing my mind.

06:54.966 --> 06:56.120
How did it go with the 'rents?

06:56.141 --> 06:58.478
It was basically Tough Love 101.

06:58.508 --> 07:02.466
Okay, I can tutor between classes,

07:02.643 --> 07:04.970
get some money, help out?

07:05.138 --> 07:06.992
No, they're right.

07:07.014 --> 07:09.359
The bills are my responsibility.

07:09.703 --> 07:10.985
I'll figure it out.

07:11.002 --> 07:12.698
You just need to focus on school

07:12.707 --> 07:17.314
and the fact that Chris Walker is
totally checking you out right now.

07:17.719 --> 07:18.864
What's up, Bay?

07:19.100 --> 07:21.175
Hey, Daphne, right?

07:21.549 --> 07:24.130
I saw you around the BSU
a bunch during the protest.

07:24.178 --> 07:26.196
I remember. Have I thanked you yet

07:26.213 --> 07:27.603
for saving Iris's life?

07:27.659 --> 07:30.503
It's hard work being a hero,
but someone's got to do it.

07:30.662 --> 07:33.605
You know, I think I saw
a kitten stuck up a tree

07:33.640 --> 07:35.149
on the east side of
campus, if you're bored.

07:35.175 --> 07:38.926
I already saved it. It was on my
way to stopping some bank robbers.

07:39.533 --> 07:42.536
You know, your dad says
you're the athletic sister.

07:42.601 --> 07:44.227
I played basketball in high school.

07:44.283 --> 07:47.071
You want to hit up the
batting cages with me later?

07:47.385 --> 07:49.031
We could hang?

07:49.085 --> 07:51.046
Oh.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.268
Uh, it's my aunt.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.221
Don't go anywhere, okay?

07:56.000 --> 08:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:10.551 --> 08:11.653
Ahem.

08:12.056 --> 08:14.858
Why do I have the feeling you all
are talking about me in front of me?

08:14.862 --> 08:16.084
'Cause we are.

08:16.441 --> 08:18.330
I'd love to hang with you.

08:22.668 --> 08:27.426
All right, your touch-up is complete.

08:29.265 --> 08:30.313
- "Gorge."
- Hmm.

08:30.330 --> 08:32.129
Well, if you like it now,

08:32.164 --> 08:34.753
wait till you see it by candlelight.

08:39.469 --> 08:41.111
Bombshell Betty's.

08:42.028 --> 08:43.034
Oh!

08:44.063 --> 08:46.365
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

08:46.417 --> 08:48.822
Um, well, if you two get back together,

08:48.826 --> 08:50.500
you know where I'll be.

08:50.664 --> 08:51.860
Bye.

08:53.989 --> 08:56.155
That was my 2:00. Apparently,

08:56.191 --> 08:57.638
Gabby dumped him

08:57.660 --> 09:00.108
so he will no longer be needing her name

09:00.125 --> 09:02.087
tattooed across his chest.

09:02.427 --> 09:04.239
I might actually have
negative money now.

09:04.605 --> 09:06.966
- That blows.
- Tell me about it.

09:07.086 --> 09:09.005
I mean, at this rate, it's
going to take me a month

09:09.017 --> 09:10.925
just to get the power turned on.

09:11.957 --> 09:13.879
Maybe I should throw a fundraiser...

09:13.915 --> 09:16.216
"Donate to the Starving Artist" fund.

09:16.255 --> 09:18.359
You know, that's not
such a terrible idea.

09:18.390 --> 09:20.769
Actually, I'm not totally
comfortable taking money from UNICEF.

09:20.786 --> 09:22.421
No, I mean having a party.

09:22.662 --> 09:24.478
I used to live in this, like, commune.

09:24.508 --> 09:27.757
And whenever we were short
on cash, we would buy a keg,

09:27.781 --> 09:30.144
invite everyone we knew
and charge 10 bucks a head.

09:30.149 --> 09:31.284
Can't even afford beer.

09:31.366 --> 09:32.730
The first hundred covers the beer.

09:32.743 --> 09:33.775
The rest goes to the house.

09:33.775 --> 09:35.655
We could make 500, easy.

09:35.845 --> 09:37.691
Except there's no lights.

09:37.726 --> 09:39.322
But we do have candles.

09:39.511 --> 09:42.269
I think there's a couple
packs of glow sticks somewhere.

09:42.308 --> 09:45.096
- That sounds atmospheric.
- Exactly!

09:45.118 --> 09:47.532
- So we're having a party?
- We're having a party!

09:50.248 --> 09:52.614
We need quantity, not quality.

09:52.673 --> 09:55.400
Although we obviously don't
want to invite any creepers.

09:55.416 --> 09:58.251
- Ooh, 2:00!
- Ally, wait.

09:58.256 --> 09:59.584
What are you guys doing tonight?

09:59.606 --> 10:01.767
We're having a "Turn on
the Lights" party upstairs.

10:01.778 --> 10:03.698
- Hey, Luca.
- Hi, Bay.

10:03.714 --> 10:06.220
It's really just, like, a couple friends

10:06.253 --> 10:09.033
hanging out without any
loud music or alcohol.

10:09.049 --> 10:11.663
- Please don't tell Regina.
- Relax, I get it.

10:11.783 --> 10:13.271
I won't say anything about your party.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.303
Really? Cool, thank you.

10:15.335 --> 10:17.244
Uh, in that case, you
should totally come.

10:17.260 --> 10:20.858
- Can't. I got Kennish game night.
- Ha! You have fun with that one.

10:20.901 --> 10:22.751
I don't. I'm Tucker.

10:23.167 --> 10:26.946
- What time should I come by?
- Uh, the party's at 9:00.

10:26.993 --> 10:29.157
And bring friends to the party.

10:31.476 --> 10:33.063
Bay?

10:35.248 --> 10:37.184
I thought that was you.

10:37.359 --> 10:40.430
Simone! Hi!

10:40.444 --> 10:41.957
What are you doing here?

10:41.970 --> 10:44.759
I have a couple of hours
before my next meeting

10:44.773 --> 10:47.125
so I swung by to borrow
Regina's Internet.

10:47.245 --> 10:51.911
- Do you work here?
- Oh, no. I'm just helping out for the day.

10:51.949 --> 10:53.966
Actually, I'm a tattoo artist.

10:54.025 --> 10:56.209
That is so perfect for you.

10:56.408 --> 10:58.677
I sold out and joined
the corporate world.

10:58.747 --> 11:01.177
My dad had an in at a
pharmaceutical company

11:01.204 --> 11:02.855
and they made me a sales rep.

11:02.975 --> 11:05.334
It's crazy. I actually love it.

11:05.383 --> 11:08.637
- Well, you look great.
- Thanks.

11:08.637 --> 11:10.331
I feel so basic sometimes,

11:10.358 --> 11:12.353
but my boss is all about the labels.

11:12.388 --> 11:14.838
He even makes me drive
this embarrassing Beemer.

11:14.870 --> 11:16.306
It's totally flashy.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.656
But you know how it is...
appearance is everything, right?

11:18.693 --> 11:20.942
Mmm. I know exactly what you mean.

11:20.974 --> 11:25.277
I have this spread coming
up in Live Ink magazine

11:25.283 --> 11:26.971
and I'm not sure if I'm gonna do it

11:26.971 --> 11:30.526
'cause I just gotta be really
protective about my brand.

11:30.569 --> 11:32.752
And I just don't want
to get all mainstream.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.091
Totally.

11:34.344 --> 11:37.039
Well, we should really get
together and catch up more.

11:37.088 --> 11:41.262
- Did I hear something about a party?
- Yes, upstairs.

11:41.320 --> 11:44.960
- We're having a "Turn on the Lights" party...
- It's a party/ meets art installation.

11:44.973 --> 11:49.095
It's a statement about our
waste of this earth's resources.

11:49.126 --> 11:51.187
You always were the creative one.

11:51.307 --> 11:54.783
And I love art shows. I'm
kind of an investor now.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.530
So I guess I'll see you tonight.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.367
Can't wait.

12:13.325 --> 12:15.605
I guess I shouldn't be
surprised you know how to hit.

12:15.816 --> 12:17.710
You grew up with a pro baller.

12:17.787 --> 12:20.618
I didn't meet the
Kennishes till I was 15.

12:20.691 --> 12:23.153
- I lived with my mom in East Riverside.
- Get out!

12:23.273 --> 12:24.801
I'm from Blue Creek.

12:25.128 --> 12:27.141
We were neighbors, we
didn't even know it.

12:28.483 --> 12:30.094
I gotta be honest, though.

12:30.129 --> 12:32.024
It's a little hard to picture you there.

12:32.399 --> 12:33.345
Why?

12:33.663 --> 12:34.739
'Cause I'm white?

12:35.169 --> 12:36.515
Or 'cause I'm deaf?

12:36.836 --> 12:37.780
Both.

12:40.283 --> 12:42.921
When I was 10, I wore
my hair in cornrows

12:42.929 --> 12:45.824
for an entire summer to try
to fit in with the other girls.

12:46.796 --> 12:51.080
Not a good look for me.

12:51.955 --> 12:55.341
I never knew anybody who
was deaf before Travis.

12:55.577 --> 12:58.707
It was hard enough growing up
over there as a hearing person.

12:58.827 --> 13:00.401
You must be pretty tough.

13:00.455 --> 13:03.446
Actually, the community
really supported me and my mom.

13:03.493 --> 13:05.537
I loved living in East Riverside.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.507
I can't wait to get out of the 'hood.

13:07.627 --> 13:10.707
As soon as I land my spot
with the Royals, I'm gone.

13:10.747 --> 13:13.490
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah, this time next year,

13:13.610 --> 13:16.697
I'll be driving a sweet ride
up to my mansion in Hallbrook,

13:16.946 --> 13:19.575
after signing a couple
hundred autographs, of course.

13:19.602 --> 13:21.733
Is it hard being so insecure?

13:22.425 --> 13:24.536
I'm not cocky, I'm confident.

13:24.718 --> 13:27.663
- I deserve that spot.
- Yeah, I get it.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.774
Hey, you want to go get some food?

13:29.821 --> 13:31.199
Keep hanging?

13:32.058 --> 13:33.922
Oh my God, you're bleeding.

13:43.318 --> 13:44.677
Simone?

13:46.182 --> 13:48.272
- Toby?
- Hey.

13:48.308 --> 13:49.630
Hi.

13:50.054 --> 13:53.863
- Oh my God, tell me that's not a baby.
- Uh, yeah.

13:53.888 --> 13:58.219
I sort of took the fast track to
the whole "marriage and kids" thing.

13:58.287 --> 13:59.761
That's great.

13:59.810 --> 14:01.573
You married that cute blond girl I met?

14:01.635 --> 14:03.854
What was her name? Nikki?

14:03.889 --> 14:07.706
Uh, no. Well, technically
yes, for a minute.

14:07.718 --> 14:09.862
Um, but my...

14:10.200 --> 14:12.086
my new wife...

14:12.460 --> 14:15.546
her name's Lily and she works at UMKC.

14:15.608 --> 14:18.427
- And this is?
- This is Carlton.

14:18.470 --> 14:21.168
Aw! Can I meet him? I love babies.

14:21.174 --> 14:22.796
Yeah, yeah.

14:24.971 --> 14:27.054
Come here, buddy.

14:29.671 --> 14:33.781
Oh. Uh, wow. I didn't realize...

14:35.249 --> 14:37.240
Yeah. So, uh...

14:37.264 --> 14:39.729
I didn't mean, uh... I just...

14:40.423 --> 14:42.057
I am so sorry.

14:43.931 --> 14:45.399
Sorry about what?

14:47.144 --> 14:50.603
Um, you know, we gotta get going.

14:50.627 --> 14:52.710
We've... we've got a
therapy session today. And...

14:53.416 --> 14:54.909
come on, buddy.

14:55.665 --> 14:57.545
It was good to see you.

14:58.576 --> 15:00.905
Okay, you're all fixed up now

15:00.954 --> 15:02.852
so give us a call if it starts again.

15:08.701 --> 15:10.753
I really killed our date, huh?

15:10.802 --> 15:13.050
Date? I thought you
said it was just a hang?

15:13.099 --> 15:16.680
You didn't know? It got
upgraded when I bled on you.

15:17.387 --> 15:20.023
And it could even become a dinner date

15:20.084 --> 15:22.106
if you play your cards right.

15:22.910 --> 15:26.228
Uh, well, my sister just texted.

15:26.246 --> 15:28.342
Apparently, we're
having a party tonight.

15:28.462 --> 15:31.328
Oh. Cool. Cool.

15:32.028 --> 15:34.928
- Do you want to come?
- Yeah, I... I'd love to.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.832
Well, you can't walk
around campus like that.

15:38.851 --> 15:40.842
Let's see...

15:42.452 --> 15:44.202
what do you think?

15:44.448 --> 15:47.564
"Student Health Center"
or "Kangaroo Crawl"?

15:47.684 --> 15:49.874
"Crawl," definitely.

15:54.802 --> 15:57.186
Whoa. What happened?

15:57.708 --> 16:00.405
Oh, I just got hit by
a baseball in practice.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.880
It looks worse than it is.

16:01.905 --> 16:03.741
That doesn't look like a ball bruise.

16:03.778 --> 16:06.985
That many colors usually means
a bunch of different bruises.

16:07.053 --> 16:10.414
Well, it hurt like I got hit
by a bunch of different balls.

16:10.426 --> 16:12.410
That Travis has got an arm on him.

16:13.479 --> 16:15.642
Hey, I gotta run.

16:15.679 --> 16:18.124
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

16:22.017 --> 16:24.250
- Hey.
- Hey. Do you know

16:24.274 --> 16:28.716
where the camping lanterns are?
They have got to be here somewhere.

16:29.134 --> 16:31.862
Who are you and what have
you done with my sister?

16:34.209 --> 16:36.439
I ran into Simone this morning

16:36.439 --> 16:39.130
and she is totally killing it.

16:39.136 --> 16:40.844
She's driving a Beemer and

16:40.850 --> 16:43.191
I can't even afford to
pay the electric bill.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.777
So the answer is "camping"?

16:45.992 --> 16:47.786
We're throwing a party tonight.

16:47.810 --> 16:50.071
Simone basically invited herself.

16:50.298 --> 16:51.896
You should have seen her, Toby.

16:51.914 --> 16:54.982
- She was wearing a blazer.
- I actually did see her.

16:55.043 --> 16:58.307
- Carlton and I stopped by for a muffin.
- Whoa.

16:58.427 --> 17:01.820
Are you okay? That must have been
weird for you after everything.

17:01.869 --> 17:03.755
No, it was no big deal. It was fine.

17:04.935 --> 17:06.729
You should DJ tonight!

17:06.848 --> 17:09.819
Lily is taking Carlton to go
visit college friends, right?

17:09.863 --> 17:12.659
And J and K are having
the Kennish game night.

17:12.676 --> 17:14.938
Tell me you are not
dying to escape that.

17:15.058 --> 17:17.045
Even if I wanted to DJ,

17:17.165 --> 17:19.250
turn tables require electricity.

17:19.275 --> 17:22.290
Well, I'll just run an extension
cord downstairs to the Cracked Mug.

17:22.358 --> 17:24.195
Come on! Please!

17:24.316 --> 17:26.961
It's gonna be so lame without music.

17:26.992 --> 17:29.424
And you're totally a big deal.

17:29.431 --> 17:31.434
How cool will we look to Simone

17:31.453 --> 17:33.602
with DJ TK at the turn tables?

17:33.817 --> 17:35.876
- Fine. Okay.
- Yay!

17:40.626 --> 17:43.121
Dr. Barminski, do you have a sec?

17:43.299 --> 17:46.684
- What's up?
- Um, I saw something kind of weird earlier.

17:46.721 --> 17:49.959
A friend of mine had a bunch of
bruises in the exact same spot,

17:49.965 --> 17:51.489
almost like a blossom.

17:51.609 --> 17:54.290
Sounds like an injection
site. Is your friend diabetic?

17:54.358 --> 17:55.347
I don't think so.

17:55.372 --> 17:57.854
Well, when we see abdominal
bruise patterns like that,

17:57.885 --> 18:01.239
we assume insulin. Forearms
could indicate narcotics.

18:01.245 --> 18:03.745
- Where was the site?
- On his deltoid, up here.

18:03.794 --> 18:05.121
Is your friend an athlete?

18:05.241 --> 18:06.621
How'd you know that?

18:06.741 --> 18:09.016
It's a common place to inject steroids.

18:09.397 --> 18:11.211
Tell your friend to be careful.

18:11.247 --> 18:13.079
He could seriously hurt himself.

18:19.652 --> 18:22.055
♪ I know I am what I do ♪

18:22.103 --> 18:24.924
♪ That's just not convenient at all ♪

18:24.966 --> 18:27.473
♪ For you, I don't know what you want ♪

18:27.498 --> 18:29.507
♪ This sure as hell ain't it... ♪

18:29.627 --> 18:31.301
Hey, is she here yet?

18:31.421 --> 18:32.696
I haven't seen her.

18:32.733 --> 18:34.496
Are you sure you don't just want me

18:34.521 --> 18:36.216
to tell Simone to go to hell?

18:36.229 --> 18:38.877
And make it seem like I care

18:38.902 --> 18:43.676
about her perfect
clothes and car and job?

18:43.694 --> 18:45.261
No, absolutely not.

18:45.487 --> 18:47.257
Um, hi there.

18:47.276 --> 18:48.989
You are not on the list.

18:49.026 --> 18:52.129
Oh, come on. Are you really still
mad about the whole T-shirt thing?

18:52.160 --> 18:53.733
Yeah. Now scram.

18:54.138 --> 18:55.564
I'll give you 20.

18:56.234 --> 18:57.389
Fine.

18:57.457 --> 19:00.208
But if you even take
one look at my portfolio,

19:00.239 --> 19:02.334
you are going to wake up with
a forehead tattoo, all right?

19:02.353 --> 19:03.846
Cool. Bye.

19:04.441 --> 19:05.706
Whoa!

19:05.958 --> 19:10.099
Cheers to be able to shave
my legs in the light tomorrow!

19:10.219 --> 19:11.953
Salute!

19:13.318 --> 19:14.842
Oh!

19:19.825 --> 19:23.622
Mmm. Someone cleaned up nice.

19:26.952 --> 19:28.618
Damn straight.

19:32.279 --> 19:33.637
Oh, Simone.

19:33.643 --> 19:36.439
I am so glad that you could make it.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.584
You remember my friend Ally?

19:38.704 --> 19:42.196
And this is my boyfriend Travis.

19:42.196 --> 19:44.414
- Oh, so you're not with Emmett?
- No!

19:45.298 --> 19:46.712
Um,

19:48.008 --> 19:50.656
Travis and I have actually been together

19:50.681 --> 19:53.221
- for almost a year.
- Gotcha.

19:53.341 --> 19:55.433
Nice to meet you, Travis.

19:55.635 --> 19:57.633
Oh, and you know Daphne.

19:57.753 --> 19:59.223
Hey, how's it going?

19:59.260 --> 20:01.840
- Good. You?
- Good.

20:02.184 --> 20:05.724
Oh, you have got to
see our view. Come on!

20:10.847 --> 20:13.164
- Hey, baller.
- Hey.

20:13.219 --> 20:15.327
Man, I'm ready for a beer.

20:15.370 --> 20:18.012
Your dad had me running
suicides for, like, an hour.

20:18.356 --> 20:21.877
But don't worry, still
ready to bust out my Nae Nae.

20:22.165 --> 20:24.715
I promise, bleeding on a girl

20:24.727 --> 20:26.790
isn't normally part of
my first-date routine.

20:26.827 --> 20:28.400
There's a routine, huh?

20:28.520 --> 20:31.165
Usually starts with
me buying you a beer.

20:31.285 --> 20:34.059
Well, technically, it's my party, so

20:34.179 --> 20:36.282
I'm buying you a beer.

20:36.345 --> 20:37.745
If you insist.

20:39.865 --> 20:43.305
British, Titanic, blond.

20:43.864 --> 20:45.339
Nicole Kidman!

20:45.400 --> 20:48.670
Kate Winslet!

20:48.706 --> 20:52.663
- Nicole Kidman is Australian, honey.
- What are you talking about?

20:52.676 --> 20:54.910
She's always talking like
an American in the movies.

20:54.944 --> 20:58.257
Oh! Regina and Luca, eight.
John and Kathryn, two.

20:58.518 --> 21:01.015
Plus our sweeping victory in Taboo.

21:01.135 --> 21:03.314
Okay, I know defeat when I see it.

21:03.339 --> 21:05.551
- I will be right back.
- I got it.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.166
It's the least I can do for
schoolin' you in your own home.

21:08.201 --> 21:09.882
Thank you.

21:09.941 --> 21:12.738
I still don't know how
you knew Miley Cyrus

21:12.772 --> 21:14.591
from "tongue, pants, ball."

21:14.615 --> 21:17.195
- You two share a brain.
- Apparently not,

21:17.215 --> 21:20.532
because Luca just aced our
economic strategies paper

21:20.542 --> 21:22.985
- and I got a C.
- What are you talking about?

21:22.985 --> 21:25.413
You said you were on the
fast track to the Dean's List.

21:25.423 --> 21:26.913
- What happened?
- I don't know.

21:26.923 --> 21:28.840
I talked to our TA Lauren,

21:29.214 --> 21:31.179
but she was weird about it.

21:31.299 --> 21:33.529
Huh. I wonder what that's all about.

21:33.553 --> 21:35.435
Just talk to her again.

21:35.445 --> 21:37.327
You know, she'll probably see the light.

21:37.347 --> 21:38.655
How about Parcheesi?

21:38.665 --> 21:40.847
- Oh yeah, baby!
- I love Parcheesi.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.882
We got cheese, we got
Parcheesi. It's gonna be great.

21:44.302 --> 21:46.180
Actually, I'm pretty tired.

21:46.215 --> 21:48.042
Um, mind if we call it a night?

21:48.077 --> 21:49.988
Really? I know what's
going on over there.

21:50.003 --> 21:51.767
You want to get out of here
while you're still ahead.

21:51.787 --> 21:53.070
It may have crossed my mind.

21:53.237 --> 21:54.431
Uh-huh. Well, you know what?

21:54.490 --> 21:56.181
You come back for a rematch someday.

21:56.196 --> 21:58.457
My pride will probably
heal in about, what?

21:58.521 --> 22:00.792
- One or two months.
- Maybe.

22:03.087 --> 22:04.532
You staying over?

22:05.668 --> 22:09.172
Ah, I have an early training
thing for the Reserves.

22:09.337 --> 22:10.691
Call you after?

22:10.811 --> 22:12.067
Sure.

22:15.366 --> 22:17.024
- See ya.
- Bye.

22:17.144 --> 22:18.552
Bye.

22:22.499 --> 22:24.047
Regina, are you okay?

22:24.332 --> 22:27.227
No, I think Luca is cheating on me.

22:30.171 --> 22:33.661
Cargo shorts over there? He has
a pathological fear of water.

22:33.715 --> 22:35.568
Hasn't showered in six years.

22:35.688 --> 22:39.377
That's nothing. The guy with the
pink shirt has multiple personalities.

22:39.497 --> 22:41.063
One owns a ferret.

22:58.250 --> 22:59.533
Wait.

23:03.549 --> 23:08.130
I must be way off-base, 'cause
I thought this was going okay?

23:09.054 --> 23:10.365
It is.

23:11.196 --> 23:12.646
That's the problem.

23:12.862 --> 23:15.276
I actually like you.

23:15.396 --> 23:17.543
Why is that a problem?

23:17.852 --> 23:19.887
Because I'm worried about you.

23:20.408 --> 23:22.462
Nose bleeds plus that bruise...

23:22.511 --> 23:26.322
It's not a big deal. I get
nose bleeds all the time.

23:26.494 --> 23:28.062
Are you sure that's all?

23:28.308 --> 23:29.871
What are you getting at?

23:29.991 --> 23:32.049
Are you using steroids?

23:32.850 --> 23:34.055
What?

23:34.389 --> 23:35.628
No!

23:35.814 --> 23:37.756
Look, I know how much
pressure you're under

23:37.790 --> 23:39.791
with my dad pushing
you for this try-out.

23:39.911 --> 23:41.762
But steroids are really dangerous.

23:41.836 --> 23:44.559
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

23:44.583 --> 23:47.085
Okay? I told you... a ball hit me.

23:47.734 --> 23:49.690
That wasn't a ball bruise.

23:49.735 --> 23:50.933
You...

23:51.213 --> 23:53.912
you got it all wrong. Okay? I'm not...

23:53.941 --> 23:55.455
If you stop now,

23:55.838 --> 23:57.976
there shouldn't be any permanent damage.

23:58.325 --> 23:59.800
You are a great player.

23:59.849 --> 24:01.638
You're still going to have a career.

24:05.364 --> 24:07.384
Is that why you invited me over tonight?

24:07.423 --> 24:09.316
So you could have an intervention?

24:09.513 --> 24:11.538
What? No, of course not.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.495
Whatever. Look, you're
the one who's trippin'

24:13.534 --> 24:15.225
'cause I don't do that stuff.

24:15.416 --> 24:17.299
And I have better things to do

24:17.318 --> 24:19.456
than to sit around and get accused

24:19.456 --> 24:22.317
by some girl I've been on one date with.

24:39.326 --> 24:41.316
That's not what a Dutch Oven is.

24:41.356 --> 24:42.998
- Don't be retarded.
- Me?

24:43.013 --> 24:44.694
You're the one who
belongs in special ed.

24:44.709 --> 24:46.641
Whatever, short bus...

24:46.665 --> 24:49.826
Okay, so Operation Simone is going great

24:49.840 --> 24:52.191
except for the part where
one of Luca's friends

24:52.210 --> 24:55.592
just chugged all the tequila
and passed out in my closet.

24:56.035 --> 24:59.220
Hey, man, can you touch
your elbow and bite your ear?

25:02.577 --> 25:04.800
Hey, what the hell is your problem?

25:04.825 --> 25:05.906
Uh, Toby?

25:05.936 --> 25:08.309
You think making fun of people
with disabilities is funny?

25:08.324 --> 25:10.035
Actually, yeah, I do.

25:10.065 --> 25:12.508
- Okay, you need to leave.
- Get out of my face, man.

25:12.533 --> 25:13.481
Hey.

25:13.601 --> 25:16.032
- Watch it.
- Oh, I get it.

25:16.057 --> 25:18.455
Is Helen Keller over
here why you're so mad?

25:18.470 --> 25:20.799
- What is your problem...
- Listen here...

25:30.122 --> 25:31.361
Hey.

25:32.762 --> 25:34.914
Aidan and those guys
are gone. Are you okay?

25:34.938 --> 25:36.969
I don't know what happened back there.

25:37.785 --> 25:41.181
That kid said "retarded,"
and I just lost it.

25:41.216 --> 25:42.733
That's understandable.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.652
The way those guys
were acting was heinous.

25:45.708 --> 25:48.612
The thing is, is like, it
never bothered me before.

25:48.637 --> 25:52.053
I mean, I even probably said
it myself before Carlton. But,

25:52.402 --> 25:54.545
man, to hear that kid tonight, some

25:54.614 --> 25:56.746
paternal instinct or something

25:56.782 --> 25:58.296
just took over.

25:58.586 --> 26:00.007
I get it.

26:00.882 --> 26:03.679
But there are a bunch
of idiots in the world.

26:03.713 --> 26:07.424
Toby, you can't freak out every
time someone makes a bad joke.

26:08.112 --> 26:10.820
It... it's not just that.

26:10.940 --> 26:12.039
Um,

26:12.703 --> 26:14.762
this morning when

26:14.954 --> 26:18.163
I introduced Carlton to Simone,

26:20.135 --> 26:23.280
her reaction was, um...

26:25.020 --> 26:28.436
It was the first time
that I had to introduce him

26:28.603 --> 26:31.012
to someone from my life

26:32.290 --> 26:33.656
who didn't already know.

26:33.715 --> 26:36.629
What do you wish Simone
had said this morning?

26:40.508 --> 26:42.130
I... I don't even know.

26:42.174 --> 26:44.214
You're new at this.

26:45.645 --> 26:48.264
But you will figure it out.

26:50.731 --> 26:53.892
All right, I... I gotta
go check on Travis.

27:00.051 --> 27:01.220
Also?

27:04.283 --> 27:07.535
I think most people are
trying to say the right thing.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.146
They just don't know how.

27:22.253 --> 27:23.747
You okay?

27:27.149 --> 27:29.105
Simone's looking for you.

27:29.980 --> 27:32.895
Well, you're up, Dr. D.

28:54.309 --> 28:56.767
You are the raddest, Kennish.

28:56.887 --> 28:59.530
Warm soda gets real old when
you're four years' sober.

28:59.550 --> 29:01.466
No problem. Perks of knowing the owner.

29:01.586 --> 29:05.472
- Hey, check it out.
- Um, hey, you guys can't be down here.

29:05.536 --> 29:07.344
Door was open. Come on.

29:07.384 --> 29:09.768
- Uh...
- Let him stay.

29:09.782 --> 29:12.913
It's like a million degrees up
there, and he is really cute.

29:12.928 --> 29:15.844
It's just, um, Regina would
kill me if anything happened.

29:15.879 --> 29:18.707
I get it. In high school,
you always seemed so tough,

29:18.752 --> 29:20.939
but we both know you were
secretly the good one.

29:20.984 --> 29:22.917
And thank God. One of us had to be.

29:22.952 --> 29:24.905
- I'll take care of it.
- You know what, Simone?

29:25.112 --> 29:26.498
- It's cool.
- You sure?

29:26.517 --> 29:28.419
Positive. Let's have fun.

29:30.926 --> 29:32.724
Is that your TA?

29:33.362 --> 29:34.744
They used to date.

29:35.201 --> 29:39.208
And now he's on his way to
her place at 10:00 on a Friday.

29:39.228 --> 29:42.364
You don't know that. These
photos are over a year old.

29:42.836 --> 29:46.012
Then why didn't Luca tell
me that he dated our TA?

29:46.132 --> 29:48.366
And how... how do you explain the text?

29:48.486 --> 29:49.786
Doesn't look good.

29:51.236 --> 29:52.808
I am so mad,

29:52.814 --> 29:55.413
I don't know whether
I should scream or cry.

29:58.107 --> 30:00.284
- Is that a tramp stamp?
- Mmm.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.150
How do I zoom in?

30:03.868 --> 30:06.340
Oh my God. I think I
just "liked" the photo.

30:06.374 --> 30:08.287
How... how do I "unlike" it?

30:08.493 --> 30:12.121
"This photo will be saved to
your favorites." No, no, no!

30:12.357 --> 30:14.751
Here, just...

30:14.967 --> 30:17.076
- Oops.
- Oops?

30:17.145 --> 30:18.865
I think I just "liked" another photo.

30:21.584 --> 30:23.968
That's not gonna fix it. No.

30:24.088 --> 30:26.505
What am I doing?

30:26.625 --> 30:30.196
I am stalking some girl on the
Internet like I'm a teenager.

30:32.295 --> 30:33.735
You know what I used to do

30:33.749 --> 30:36.217
when I was stalking a boyfriend's ex?

30:37.225 --> 30:40.238
- Which apartment is it?
- I have no idea.

30:40.243 --> 30:42.091
So much easier with a house.

30:42.332 --> 30:44.200
It's okay. We'll just wait him out.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.714
I mean, he has to come
out at some point, right?

30:46.122 --> 30:49.675
Unless the whole "Reserves"
thing was a lie too?

30:49.795 --> 30:52.659
You know, I'm sort of surprised.

30:52.974 --> 30:55.225
You and Luca seem so good together.

30:55.345 --> 30:57.771
Well, sure, right now. But just wait.

30:57.785 --> 31:00.268
In a couple years, he's
going to want to have kids

31:00.297 --> 31:04.214
and then he'll run straight back
to Lauren's young, hot ovaries.

31:04.440 --> 31:07.006
Regina, where is this coming from?

31:08.475 --> 31:10.658
Do you remember when Luca's dad came by?

31:10.692 --> 31:11.828
Sure.

31:11.995 --> 31:15.186
He thinks I'm single-handedly
terminating their family line.

31:15.235 --> 31:18.469
Wow. That's a big thing
to drop on someone.

31:19.529 --> 31:21.365
What did Luca say about it?

31:21.485 --> 31:23.856
Nothing. I didn't tell him.

31:24.835 --> 31:27.131
Can I give you some advice from a person

31:27.146 --> 31:29.731
who's been married longer
than that TA's been alive?

31:30.945 --> 31:32.881
Secrets fester.

31:33.132 --> 31:36.086
You may be bad at Luca for
not being honest with you,

31:36.125 --> 31:38.628
but you have to be honest with him.

31:38.748 --> 31:40.034
You're right.

31:41.524 --> 31:43.633
This is crazy. Let's get out of here.

31:49.838 --> 31:51.546
Oh.

31:54.220 --> 31:55.788
Oh.

31:58.761 --> 32:00.339
Man.

32:09.087 --> 32:10.626
Hey, good news.

32:10.646 --> 32:12.838
I met a girl upstairs who's
looking for a roommate.

32:12.912 --> 32:16.102
- You're leaving us?
- Just your couch.

32:16.222 --> 32:17.822
I liked having you around.

32:17.896 --> 32:20.467
Hey, you two... you're up.

32:21.312 --> 32:23.972
- Come on, let's kick her ass.
- Oh, you're on!

32:25.658 --> 32:28.926
Ready? One, two, three.

32:28.980 --> 32:31.507
- Go!
- Whoo! Ah.

32:33.532 --> 32:37.150
- All right.
- This is harder than I thought.

32:39.362 --> 32:40.684
Nailed it!

32:41.096 --> 32:42.379
Chug.

32:43.686 --> 32:46.172
I am sober. You're drinking for two.

32:52.011 --> 32:54.336
- Bay?
- Luca!

32:55.049 --> 32:56.764
What's going on? I got your text.

32:56.813 --> 33:00.794
Uh, I texted you because
your buddy Tucker...

33:00.809 --> 33:02.613
he passed out on my
favorite pair of boots,

33:02.618 --> 33:04.034
but he is fine now

33:04.058 --> 33:05.989
and he taught me how
to play Civil War, see?

33:06.029 --> 33:07.696
Regina's gonna freak out.

33:07.730 --> 33:10.212
We need to get these people
back upstairs right now.

33:10.231 --> 33:12.802
Oh, It'll be fine. I'll clean
up later. She'll never know.

33:12.802 --> 33:14.189
What up, Barahona?

33:14.228 --> 33:15.988
-  Hey, Bay, toss me that ball.
- Okay.

33:16.302 --> 33:19.188
- Whoo!
- Tucker, wait!

33:26.434 --> 33:27.962
That's not good.

33:29.811 --> 33:31.280
What were you thinking?

33:31.400 --> 33:34.942
It was just a small party to
pay off the electricity bill

33:34.976 --> 33:37.188
and no one was supposed
to come down here.

33:37.227 --> 33:40.663
- But I opened it up to make a coffee...
- And what?

33:41.622 --> 33:43.613
Some of these mugs are antiques.

33:43.623 --> 33:45.230
I can never replace them.

33:45.991 --> 33:47.760
I didn't mean for this to happen.

33:48.488 --> 33:50.808
You are under age.

33:50.838 --> 33:53.891
If the cops had shown up, they
could have shut me down, Bay.

33:54.427 --> 33:56.673
I'm really sorry.

33:56.850 --> 33:58.064
Well, good.

33:58.184 --> 34:00.320
I expect you to cover the damages.

34:01.408 --> 34:03.063
Um...

34:04.237 --> 34:06.247
I'm sorry to interrupt.

34:06.306 --> 34:07.859
I just wanted to let you know that

34:07.879 --> 34:09.844
everyone's gone from upstairs.

34:10.094 --> 34:11.447
Thanks.

34:15.915 --> 34:17.454
I'll walk you out.

34:22.108 --> 34:23.495
Well, uh,

34:24.315 --> 34:26.286
congratulations. You win.

34:26.406 --> 34:29.466
Uh, I'm a mess.

34:30.507 --> 34:31.753
My party wasn't

34:31.969 --> 34:34.170
an art installation, it was a fundraiser

34:34.175 --> 34:36.702
because I'm so broke,
I can't pay my bills.

34:36.741 --> 34:39.224
- I wasn't judging you.
- Well, maybe you should.

34:39.288 --> 34:42.134
You've got this amazing
job, this amazing

34:42.532 --> 34:45.943
wardrobe, this amazing car.
And seeing you this morning

34:45.953 --> 34:48.007
sent me straight back to high school.

34:48.022 --> 34:49.422
And all I could think
about was beating you,

34:49.438 --> 34:52.224
when the truth is, I'm a disaster.

34:52.716 --> 34:57.734
Look, my life may not be as
fabulous as I made it seem.

34:57.854 --> 35:01.037
Yeah, I make six figures,
but I'm miserable.

35:01.204 --> 35:03.809
I don't have time to
make friends or date.

35:03.838 --> 35:06.856
And I'm basically paid to
take doctors out to lunch

35:06.861 --> 35:08.468
and let them hit on me.

35:08.994 --> 35:10.287
Wow.

35:10.868 --> 35:13.611
And I was at the Cracked Mug
this morning to see Regina,

35:13.731 --> 35:16.732
my sponsor, because I've been so unhappy

35:16.737 --> 35:19.147
that I almost fell off
the wagon last week.

35:20.291 --> 35:22.887
I never would have guessed.

35:23.236 --> 35:25.635
You seem so together.

35:25.983 --> 35:28.402
I guess we just bring out
the worst in each other.

35:28.982 --> 35:30.309
Do you know how jealous I am

35:30.309 --> 35:33.062
that you've actually turned
your passion into a job?

35:33.509 --> 35:35.092
Why are we so competitive?

35:35.323 --> 35:36.463
I don't know.

35:37.054 --> 35:38.759
Can we call a truce?

35:39.265 --> 35:40.515
Yes.

35:41.648 --> 35:44.096
Just don't sleep with
my boyfriend, okay?

35:52.603 --> 35:54.146
Honey, what's wrong?

35:54.781 --> 35:58.752
I found out something at
the health center today

35:59.533 --> 36:00.938
and I don't want to tell you.

36:00.955 --> 36:03.450
And I could probably lose my
position for saying something,

36:03.491 --> 36:06.999
but I'm really worried that you're
going to end up in big trouble.

36:07.119 --> 36:08.826
Daphne, what is it?

36:09.914 --> 36:13.573
I think someone on the
baseball team is using steroids.

36:19.017 --> 36:20.574
It's gonna take two weeks

36:20.601 --> 36:22.527
to replace that ceramic dripper.

36:23.499 --> 36:25.696
You're mad at Bay for being immature

36:25.712 --> 36:28.437
when you pulled a drive-by
at my ex-girlfriend's place?

36:33.120 --> 36:33.985
Yeah.

36:34.217 --> 36:35.507
Lauren texted me.

36:36.030 --> 36:38.903
I know all about your covert ops.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.166
I'm sorry.

36:40.286 --> 36:43.343
I saw her text inviting you over.

36:43.351 --> 36:47.154
Then you left. And I guess
I went a little crazy.

36:47.166 --> 36:49.116
I went to bail out Bay.

36:49.344 --> 36:51.074
I know that now.

36:51.133 --> 36:53.272
But you have to admit, it looked bad.

36:53.783 --> 36:55.898
Why didn't you tell me you guys dated?

36:55.957 --> 36:59.383
Because we agreed not to
talk about our exes, remember?

36:59.438 --> 37:02.044
You said there was no
point in living in the past.

37:03.023 --> 37:04.179
Oh, yeah.

37:04.218 --> 37:06.212
And I only texted
Lauren in the first place

37:06.228 --> 37:09.185
because I was worried she'd
docked your grade because of me.

37:09.213 --> 37:10.290
And did she?

37:10.471 --> 37:13.471
She said you confused Fool
Theory with Odd Theory.

37:13.491 --> 37:14.903
Oh, damn it.

37:15.528 --> 37:16.661
I don't get it.

37:16.708 --> 37:18.910
What have I ever done to
make you think I'd cheat.

37:18.921 --> 37:19.953
Nothing.

37:20.369 --> 37:21.887
Well, what is it then?

37:24.801 --> 37:27.466
Your dad told me I
was standing in the way

37:27.494 --> 37:30.733
- of your having children.
- And you listened to him?

37:31.332 --> 37:34.370
I told you, I don't want kids.

37:34.395 --> 37:35.849
Sure, right now.

37:35.903 --> 37:37.933
But you might someday.

37:38.626 --> 37:42.081
Being in Afghanistan taught me
there might not be a "someday."

37:42.406 --> 37:44.902
I have to trust in
what I want right now.

37:45.246 --> 37:46.868
And that's you.

37:47.929 --> 37:50.613
If that changes, we'll deal with it.

37:51.173 --> 37:52.471
Okay?

37:52.591 --> 37:53.803
Okay.

38:01.924 --> 38:03.807
- Hi.
- Hey.

38:04.505 --> 38:05.616
Thanks for coming.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.734
I was gonna text you too.

38:08.682 --> 38:10.766
I hate the way that we left things.

38:10.781 --> 38:12.737
I'm so sorry if I...

38:13.052 --> 38:14.369
I mean,

38:15.141 --> 38:16.797
I just didn't know what to say.

38:17.181 --> 38:18.527
Me neither.

38:21.117 --> 38:23.255
Hey, come here.

38:23.290 --> 38:24.856
Oh!

38:24.976 --> 38:26.862
Oh, yes.

38:27.595 --> 38:29.194
Yeah, come over here.

38:29.443 --> 38:31.355
Just sit up and meet Simone.

38:31.517 --> 38:35.315
So this is my son Carlton.

38:35.995 --> 38:38.320
He's... he's a year old

38:39.067 --> 38:40.803
and he has Down syndrome.

38:41.604 --> 38:44.185
He also has an amazing laugh,

38:44.352 --> 38:46.927
a real thing for blueberries,

38:47.006 --> 38:48.997
and is killer on percussion.

38:49.046 --> 38:51.971
He's adorable.

38:52.006 --> 38:53.583
Thank you.

38:53.703 --> 38:54.886
Hi.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.515
Hi.

38:57.635 --> 38:58.931
So, um,

38:59.358 --> 39:01.496
I hear you're a pharmaceutical rep?

39:01.541 --> 39:02.652
Yeah.

39:03.079 --> 39:03.974
Hmm.

39:04.094 --> 39:05.277
How's that?

39:05.397 --> 39:07.316
Well, it sucks.

39:08.653 --> 39:11.318
I'm... I'm in my car 12 hours a day.

39:11.347 --> 39:12.921
If I have to wear another blazer,

39:12.945 --> 39:14.670
I don't know what I'm going to do...

39:19.418 --> 39:20.966
Daphne, wait. Wait.

39:21.241 --> 39:23.758
What the hell? Did you narc on me?

39:24.284 --> 39:27.858
- Yeah, I did.
- Are you trying to ruin my life?

39:27.926 --> 39:30.451
Of course not. I didn't say your name,

39:30.506 --> 39:32.657
but my parents need to
know they have a problem.

39:32.777 --> 39:34.807
Maybe your coach can convince you

39:34.856 --> 39:37.363
that your health is more
important than a better fastball.

39:38.303 --> 39:41.309
You think I'm using because
I want to throw better?

39:41.616 --> 39:44.387
I'm using because a
cop tried to arrest me

39:44.400 --> 39:46.396
and he strained my rotator cuff.

39:46.691 --> 39:49.056
I stopped taking that
stuff a few days ago.

39:49.123 --> 39:51.471
It was just for a little bit, you know,

39:51.489 --> 39:53.425
because my Royals' try-out is next week

39:53.824 --> 39:56.711
and I didn't have enough time to
let my shoulder heal naturally.

39:56.748 --> 39:59.101
If you stopped using,
then you should be fine.

39:59.144 --> 40:01.300
Right! My career is done.

40:01.356 --> 40:03.635
Don't you think you're
being a little dramatic?

40:03.755 --> 40:06.675
My dad's going to yell
and lecture, and that's it.

40:06.706 --> 40:09.796
A lecture? You think
that's what's coming?

40:10.251 --> 40:14.373
Your mom ordered a mandatory
drug test for the whole team.

40:15.597 --> 40:17.666
My life is over.

40:26.771 --> 40:28.571
I don't think I can do this.

40:28.848 --> 40:31.287
Ah, it's time to let go, sweetie.

40:31.407 --> 40:33.279
Move on.

40:34.551 --> 40:37.358
She's been with me through so much...

40:37.478 --> 40:40.178
running away to Mexico with Zarra,

40:40.356 --> 40:42.826
that terrible octopus phase,

40:42.850 --> 40:44.484
my time on the chain gang.

40:44.515 --> 40:46.814
Now she'll be there for somebody else.

40:46.844 --> 40:49.406
I'm the funky artist with the cool car.

40:49.455 --> 40:51.949
If I let her go, what does that make me?

40:51.986 --> 40:55.255
The funky artist who can pay her bills.

40:56.723 --> 41:00.931
I know it sounds dumb
and it's just a car, but

41:02.234 --> 41:06.565
I feel like I'm saying goodbye
to being a kid or something.

41:07.586 --> 41:10.545
Well, you are a little bit.
