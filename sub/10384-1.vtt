THE SESSIONS
Transcript and sync: jcdr

00:53.077 --> 00:56.488
<i>Mark O'Brien has been going
to UC Berkeley since 1978.</i>

00:56.522 --> 00:59.965
<i>That's O'Brien in the motorized
gurney heading for class last week.</i>

01:00.081 --> 01:02.135
<i>He had polio when he was 6 years old.</i>

01:02.180 --> 01:05.826
<i>The disease left his body crippled
but his mind remained sharp and alert,</i>

01:06.042 --> 01:07.915
<i>and since he wanted to be a writer,</i>

01:07.959 --> 01:11.509
<i>Mark O'Brien entered Cal to major
in English and learn his trade.</i>

01:14.848 --> 01:18.588
<i>He wrote this poem for us about
school here, and about graduation.</i>

01:19.191 --> 01:20.673
Graduation.

01:21.554 --> 01:24.400
Today I hear the crowd’s applause.

01:24.612 --> 01:27.954
Receive congratulations from my friends.

01:29.060 --> 01:32.971
Today I ask if I’ve found
a place among the rest,

01:33.580 --> 01:36.781
who studied, read, wrote,

01:37.413 --> 01:40.660
and passed the test in cap and gown.

01:41.458 --> 01:45.823
Today, I hope you see
a man upon the stage.

01:45.880 --> 01:49.974
<i>Mark O'Brien teaches us that courage
and perseverance overcome obstacles.</i>

01:50.450 --> 01:55.157
<i>With Mark O'Brien at UC Berkeley, Bill
Hillman, Channel Five Eyewitness News.</i>

02:30.064 --> 02:31.327
Breathing.

02:32.821 --> 02:34.123
Look you.

02:34.869 --> 02:38.311
This most excellent canopy, the air,

02:38.499 --> 02:42.840
presses down upon me at
15 pounds per square inch,

02:43.417 --> 02:47.018
a dense, heavy, blue glowing ocean,

02:47.390 --> 02:50.614
teasing me with its
nearness and immensity.

02:51.368 --> 02:54.083
And all I get is a thin stream of it.

02:54.604 --> 02:59.586
A finger’s width of the rope
that ties me to life.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.654
Shit!

03:15.771 --> 03:18.521
Okay, just focus.

03:18.801 --> 03:20.861
Scratch with your mind.

03:21.698 --> 03:23.906
Okay, your mind.

03:25.310 --> 03:28.211
Scratch with your mind…

03:39.529 --> 03:40.729
Good morning.

04:05.646 --> 04:06.846
Good morning.

04:07.774 --> 04:08.974
You're late.

04:17.601 --> 04:18.740
Joan.

04:19.779 --> 04:23.065
I swear this was one crazy bitch,

04:23.755 --> 04:26.198
who’d swing me about
enough to scare me,

04:26.577 --> 04:30.567
but careful enough so she could say:
“Now what was all the yelling about?

04:30.638 --> 04:34.698
You polios are screamers. Always were.”

04:35.995 --> 04:38.095
I didn’t say a word,

04:38.136 --> 04:41.055
but typed my skinny novel in my head,

04:41.554 --> 04:43.422
and thought about revenge.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.115
Would you mind if I asked you a favor?

05:01.621 --> 05:04.525
What, you need help moving furniture?

05:06.734 --> 05:11.122
I need an advance on my
pay, like two weeks.

05:11.193 --> 05:14.003
And that's not exactly
asking too much, is it?

05:14.331 --> 05:16.731
What if you don't last another two weeks?

05:19.383 --> 05:23.599
It was a real drag that I was no longer
allowed to use my other gurney,

05:23.747 --> 05:25.255
the self-propelled one.

05:25.893 --> 05:29.096
It had caused a couple of
spectacular accidents.

05:29.932 --> 05:35.515
Basically, in spite of all the mirrors,
I couldn't see where I was going.

05:36.130 --> 05:41.510
Mary's fear and apprehension
slowly gave way to pride and purpose.

05:41.846 --> 05:44.351
Elizabeth, pregnant herself with St. John,

05:44.481 --> 05:47.578
felt the power of this wondrous woman.

05:47.794 --> 05:51.424
It was Elizabeth, and her absolute faith,

05:51.581 --> 05:54.711
that gave Mary
the courage she was lacking,

05:55.107 --> 05:59.261
and she gave thanks saying:
“My soul doth magnify the Lord,

05:59.401 --> 06:03.062
and my spirit hath rejoiced
in God my Saviour”.

06:04.154 --> 06:07.154
May the spirit of the Lord be amongst
you and remain with you always.

06:09.871 --> 06:11.671
I’m definitely a true believer.

06:12.601 --> 06:15.476
But I believe in a God
with a sense of humor.

06:15.719 --> 06:17.663
A wicked sense of humor.

06:18.131 --> 06:22.154
One who created me in His own image.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.818
Hello. I don't think we've met.

06:25.035 --> 06:26.595
I'm Father Brendan.

06:30.642 --> 06:32.202
I’m Mark O’Brien.

06:32.623 --> 06:34.972
I knew Father Seamus very well.

06:35.393 --> 06:37.793
I'm sorry that he's not here any more.

06:38.270 --> 06:41.377
As are many others.
I'll do my best to fill his shoes.

06:41.464 --> 06:43.517
I understand you'd like me
to hear your confession.

06:43.562 --> 06:44.762
Yes, I would.

06:44.990 --> 06:48.597
I told my attendant to come back
in half an hour, is that okay?

06:49.777 --> 06:50.526
I'm in no rush.

06:50.574 --> 06:53.983
I can be a bit time consuming,
but I’m worth the trouble.

06:56.306 --> 06:57.616
I’m here for you Mark.

07:01.268 --> 07:02.851
Look…

07:03.901 --> 07:08.696
This is not exactly a confession,
I haven't yet done the deed.

07:08.945 --> 07:11.786
I was hoping to sort of
get a quote in advance.

07:13.052 --> 07:14.852
What's on your mind?

07:15.702 --> 07:20.543
The most immediate thing on my mind
would be one of my attendants, Joan.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.098
I'm thinking of getting rid of her.

07:23.383 --> 07:25.783
It's an evil thought, but I can't help it.

07:25.848 --> 07:29.504
— Is she dishonest, or incompetent?
— No, neither of those.

07:29.902 --> 07:31.702
She looks at me the wrong way.

07:32.455 --> 07:35.522
It's that "you need me
more than I need you" look.

07:35.855 --> 07:40.287
I'd like to show her she's wrong, just
for the evil satisfaction it will give me.

07:41.345 --> 07:42.905
Is that a sin, Father?

07:45.208 --> 07:47.008
Well, it obviously troubles you.

07:47.108 --> 07:52.050
Yes, it troubles me a lot, because
maybe it's really a power trip.

07:52.340 --> 07:56.400
You know. It's me against her.
Me against the world.

07:56.439 --> 07:58.431
I really wouldn't worry about that.

07:58.486 --> 08:01.486
The question is whether you
like having her around.

08:01.539 --> 08:03.909
— I can't stand her.
— Well then get rid of her.

08:04.953 --> 08:07.953
If I were in a position to choose,
I'd find someone nice.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.700
Even it was a power trip.

08:09.802 --> 08:12.674
Then I have your blessing to fire her?

08:13.292 --> 08:15.338
Unofficially, yes.

08:15.518 --> 08:17.318
That's good enough for me.

08:41.503 --> 08:42.623
Amanda.

08:44.086 --> 08:50.568
Amanda would have been a pretty girl
to touch, to hold, to kiss.

08:50.794 --> 08:52.825
Do you have any experience?

08:53.851 --> 08:55.630
No, none at all.

08:55.755 --> 08:57.315
That sounds perfect.

09:06.858 --> 09:09.199
So, how long can you stay out?

09:09.742 --> 09:11.302
Three or four hours.

09:12.310 --> 09:14.565
Depends how much fun I’m having.

09:15.472 --> 09:20.033
As she glided through crowds of lives,
she couldn't leave me lying there

09:20.415 --> 09:24.296
dried out bubble gum stuck
on the underneath of existence.

09:26.045 --> 09:30.785
She took me on a picnic once,
with her boyfriend and another couple.

09:31.504 --> 09:34.033
Lust crackled in the air.

09:35.775 --> 09:38.022
But what did the boyfriend think?

09:38.815 --> 09:40.650
That I was in his way?

09:43.998 --> 09:49.051
I'm always in somebody's way, I
thought, the sun in my eyes.

09:55.762 --> 09:56.882
And?

09:58.418 --> 09:59.538
What?

10:01.472 --> 10:03.100
And, do you touch him?

10:03.286 --> 10:05.569
Yeah, I do everything.

10:06.491 --> 10:08.051
Any other questions?

10:09.394 --> 10:10.794
— It's gross.
— What?

10:12.032 --> 10:13.852
What'd you say?

10:13.980 --> 10:17.735
Okay, look. No need to be defensive,
okay? I'm not exactly threatened

10:17.787 --> 10:19.352
by this guy.
— Yeah? Why not?

10:19.486 --> 10:21.722
God, he's a much more a man than you are.

10:26.437 --> 10:28.309
So what does your boyfriend think of me?

10:28.390 --> 10:30.911
He's an asshole. It doesn't
matter what he thinks of you.

10:30.935 --> 10:33.643
I'm interested in the
opinion of an asshole.

10:34.825 --> 10:38.315
He thinks that you are
some kind of Svengali,

10:38.396 --> 10:41.448
and that you're gonna
hypnotize me into your cult.

10:41.556 --> 10:42.756
He's right.

10:44.359 --> 10:46.759
He says he can already see changes.

10:50.465 --> 10:54.947
Her perfect, pale skin,
her Tudor court face,

10:55.478 --> 11:00.741
her strong, fleshy legs
drove me into ecstasies of despair.

11:03.919 --> 11:06.901
All I wished for were hands that moved,

11:07.386 --> 11:09.150
just to touch her.

11:10.323 --> 11:12.423
That would have been enough.

11:14.106 --> 11:18.017
So with her gentle fearless heart,
she took me in.

11:18.685 --> 11:22.792
I thrived in her garden,
and wanted more.

11:38.810 --> 11:40.806
This you must have.

11:42.409 --> 11:43.529
What?

11:45.307 --> 11:48.172
I love you.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.000
Did she reciprocate your feelings?

12:11.320 --> 12:12.381
She didn't seem to.

12:12.467 --> 12:15.349
Well, sometimes people can be
very shy about their emotions.

12:15.387 --> 12:16.507
Well…

12:17.458 --> 12:19.651
in case she didn't get it the first time,

12:19.954 --> 12:22.096
I told her again that I
was in love with her,

12:22.290 --> 12:26.217
and wanted to marry her,
thinking it might swing things.

12:26.316 --> 12:28.251
— Did it?
— Yes.

12:28.889 --> 12:30.089
She left.

12:38.809 --> 12:45.384
Amanda could have been a pretty girl
to touch, to hold, to take to bed.

12:48.821 --> 12:50.621
I wish I knew what to say.

12:51.588 --> 12:53.178
I mean, welcome to the human race,

12:53.195 --> 12:55.531
every day somebody breaks
somebody else's heart.

12:58.406 --> 13:00.013
And as I said, I'm here for you.

13:00.014 --> 13:02.677
I just wish I had something
more useful to offer.

13:03.411 --> 13:05.767
All I have are these vague
ideas about life and death

13:05.790 --> 13:07.621
that priests are equipped with.

13:08.363 --> 13:11.363
Have you considered sharing
your feelings with a therapist?

13:11.581 --> 13:12.781
Not really.

13:14.133 --> 13:15.533
Father…

13:17.257 --> 13:19.057
I think I need a hug.

13:20.268 --> 13:22.612
— A hug?
— Yeah.

13:40.697 --> 13:43.132
— Hi. Vera?
— Yes.

13:43.203 --> 13:44.976
— I'm Rod.
— Hi.

13:45.309 --> 13:46.869
I usually do four to midnights.

13:48.447 --> 13:50.127
But we can switch as necessary.

14:02.084 --> 14:03.884
Have you had any experience?

14:04.399 --> 14:05.359
Some.

14:10.318 --> 14:12.118
Would you get that, please.

14:18.538 --> 14:19.498
Hullo?

14:22.695 --> 14:25.981
It's Sandy, from Pacific News Service.

14:26.702 --> 14:29.966
Could you press that button and
put it on the speaker phone, please.

14:34.233 --> 14:35.304
Hi, Sandy.

14:35.361 --> 14:36.921
Hi, Mark, how you doing?

14:37.451 --> 14:38.651
I'm good.

14:39.214 --> 14:40.774
I have a new attendant.

14:41.204 --> 14:43.368
She answered the phone, her name's Vera.

14:43.751 --> 14:44.951
Welcome, Vera.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.502
Thank you.

14:47.710 --> 14:51.379
Mark, we're doing a series of articles
that I think might interest you.

14:51.514 --> 14:53.613
The subject is 'Sex and the disabled'.

14:54.424 --> 14:57.270
It would involve interviewing
people in the Berkeley area.

14:58.156 --> 14:59.356
But why now?

14:59.578 --> 15:01.138
Because we've got the money now.

15:01.888 --> 15:04.888
But if you're working on something else,
then we can talk about it later.

15:09.649 --> 15:10.769
No…

15:11.277 --> 15:12.837
now is fine.

15:13.142 --> 15:14.262
Great!

15:17.703 --> 15:19.263
There was no escaping it.

15:20.974 --> 15:23.792
A door had opened which I could not close,

15:25.980 --> 15:28.188
and in invisible writing it said:

15:29.071 --> 15:30.337
“Do not enter”.

15:36.512 --> 15:39.512
Most positions like that one
are pretty much impossible.

15:39.682 --> 15:41.658
I don't know if you can
quite visualize it,

15:41.705 --> 15:44.705
but it's called a lateral, or
sideways reverse cowgirl.

15:46.934 --> 15:50.861
It's okay. it's just a question of
depth of penetration for most people,

15:50.876 --> 15:54.444
like my partner, for instance.
It doesn't really matter to me.

15:54.465 --> 15:56.853
I mean, I just get just as excited
when he licks my nipples,

15:56.876 --> 15:58.608
when he bothers to do that.

16:02.694 --> 16:05.094
I think your tapes ran out.

16:14.437 --> 16:16.237
Do you want to continue?

16:16.708 --> 16:19.627
Uh… That's okay Carmen.

16:19.970 --> 16:24.390
I think I've actually got
enough to work on. Thanks.

16:24.450 --> 16:25.911
Okay well, can you call
if you need anything,

16:25.946 --> 16:27.505
and let me give you Greg's number,

16:27.530 --> 16:30.145
'cause he's full of thinks
you wouldn't think were possible.

16:30.348 --> 16:32.371
Oral sex is a matter of taste.

16:32.871 --> 16:37.071
And one thing that really works in my
favor is that I smoke so much weed that

16:37.198 --> 16:39.297
my taste buds are pretty jaded.

16:39.650 --> 16:42.944
This gives me a great deal of
stamina in the tongue department,

16:43.220 --> 16:45.780
and stamina is key in cunnilingus.

16:54.754 --> 16:56.314
Who are these people?

16:58.517 --> 17:02.279
I feel like an anthropologist
interviewing a tribe of headhunters.

17:07.255 --> 17:08.375
Hi.

17:09.192 --> 17:11.292
It's good to see you.
How are things?

17:12.153 --> 17:13.853
— Well…
— I'm sorry.

17:15.471 --> 17:17.846
Things are a little confusing,
Father Brendan.

17:18.444 --> 17:22.895
I would appreciate your advice as a
friend… if you know what I mean.

17:23.387 --> 17:26.143
Sure. And I understand what you mean.

17:28.862 --> 17:32.641
Do you remember at one point you
suggested I might see a therapist?

17:32.719 --> 17:34.469
— Yes.
— Well…

17:34.524 --> 17:38.998
one way or another, it's a long story,
I ended up seeing a therapist.

17:40.526 --> 17:43.516
A particular sort of therapist.

17:45.078 --> 17:46.359
A sex therapist.

17:48.528 --> 17:49.937
Good morning UC Berkeley.

17:50.075 --> 17:52.488
May I please speak to
someone in the Center

17:52.489 --> 17:54.572
for Sexuality and Disability, please.

17:55.749 --> 18:00.300
I'm sorry sir, the Center for Sexuality
and Disability has been shut down.

18:02.370 --> 18:04.653
— Thank God.
— Sir?

18:04.736 --> 18:06.536
I'm sorry I have bothered you.

18:06.702 --> 18:07.929
It's no bother…

18:08.801 --> 18:11.423
Oh, Sir, before you go, I can
give you a phone number

18:11.449 --> 18:13.657
for one of the therapists
who used to work there.

18:14.055 --> 18:15.299
Would you like that?

18:17.115 --> 18:18.235
It's fine, we can—

18:18.284 --> 18:21.416
— Everything's gonna work just fine.
— I don't like this, just forget about it.

18:21.449 --> 18:23.329
— Mark, you wanna see this woman or not?
— No!

18:23.345 --> 18:24.766
— Well, it's too late.
— What floor?

18:24.797 --> 18:25.917
18th floor.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.257
What sort of chance do you give me?

18:32.343 --> 18:34.249
Of achieving your romantic fantasy?

18:34.609 --> 18:36.038
Very small to minute.

18:36.101 --> 18:38.501
Oh look, you don't have
to pull any punches.

18:38.625 --> 18:40.184
You can be direct with me.

18:40.263 --> 18:42.059
Mark, I'm just a humble sex therapist.

18:43.021 --> 18:46.021
I try to help people with sex
problems that can be addressed.

18:46.911 --> 18:49.451
Your problem, I understand, is
that you have never had sex.

18:51.014 --> 18:52.272
That's correct.

18:52.401 --> 18:54.883
Would I be correct in assuming
you're unable to masturbate?

18:54.937 --> 18:55.781
Correct.

18:55.832 --> 18:57.305
Has anyone done it for you?

18:57.398 --> 18:58.358
No.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.857
Have you ever asked anyone?

18:59.975 --> 19:01.535
Not specifically.

19:02.004 --> 19:04.573
I asked someone to
marry me once, she declined.

19:05.713 --> 19:08.113
Does that come close to masturbation?

19:09.602 --> 19:12.412
You know, being with the person you love

19:12.639 --> 19:15.263
is not the only way of expressing
yourself sexually.

19:15.832 --> 19:18.232
There are people called sex surrogates.

19:18.365 --> 19:19.325
Oh?

19:20.287 --> 19:22.687
My penis speaks to me, Father Brendan.

19:23.809 --> 19:27.362
Sometimes I ejaculate during a bed
bath in front of my attendant.

19:28.127 --> 19:32.296
All I feel is shame and mortification,
while other men apparently get pleasure.

19:33.749 --> 19:35.549
I'm sorry if I sound angry.

19:35.873 --> 19:38.058
Don't worry about it. Go on.

19:46.239 --> 19:47.939
This therapist…

19:48.819 --> 19:51.916
suggested I could work
with a sexual specialist,

19:53.446 --> 19:56.186
have sex with someone
known as a sex surrogate,

19:56.225 --> 19:59.527
who would be sensitive
to my unusual needs.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.785
I've been giving it some thought.

20:01.957 --> 20:03.157
Hold on.

20:03.609 --> 20:05.561
What do you mean “have sex”?

20:05.655 --> 20:07.429
Well, when a man and
a woman love each other,

20:07.445 --> 20:09.554
— then they have—
— No, I understand what it—uhm…

20:10.609 --> 20:13.009
Are we talking about sexual intercourse?

20:14.257 --> 20:16.575
— I think so.
— Outside marriage?

20:16.649 --> 20:19.942
I did do my best on the
question of marriage.

20:22.303 --> 20:26.769
What's the difference between this
sexual specialist and a common prostitute?

20:27.214 --> 20:30.782
I don’t know, but I think
there’s a difference.

20:38.973 --> 20:40.777
— How old are you?
— Thirty-eight.

20:41.065 --> 20:42.625
Why exactly now?

20:42.773 --> 20:45.650
I never had any cash before.
That's a major factor.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.765
And I'm probably getting close
to my use-by date.

20:57.870 --> 21:00.270
And this is what you want my advice on?

21:00.403 --> 21:01.603
Fornication?

21:01.952 --> 21:04.106
Your advice as a friend.

21:05.918 --> 21:08.318
And do I have the deciding vote,
so to speak?

21:08.457 --> 21:12.376
Well, let's just say I value your advice
just as much as I do the therapist's.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.648
You're serious about this?

21:16.730 --> 21:18.835
I think sex is a serious matter.

21:19.594 --> 21:23.287
It’s one of the most persistent
themes in the bible. So…

21:25.026 --> 21:31.937
is it possible for me to know a woman
in the biblical sense, so to speak,

21:33.641 --> 21:34.761
And…

21:36.563 --> 21:38.662
and do I want to find out?

21:41.211 --> 21:43.965
— You want my opinion?
— Please.

21:56.270 --> 22:00.189
In my heart I feel like He’ll give
you a free pass on this one.

22:05.293 --> 22:07.105
— Go for it.
— What?

22:07.191 --> 22:09.245
— Go for it.
— Really?

22:09.332 --> 22:11.691
Yes. If you feel up to it.

22:12.008 --> 22:14.646
Do you feel up to it?
— To tell the truth…

22:15.614 --> 22:16.998
I'm scared.

22:17.068 --> 22:18.628
Well then we should pray.

22:26.778 --> 22:28.184
Sweet Jesus,

22:29.174 --> 22:35.663
Mark and I sit at your feet and pray
that You bless this little journey,

22:35.727 --> 22:38.662
this one small step for a man.

22:40.132 --> 22:42.232
I really feel proud of myself,

22:43.217 --> 22:46.848
imposing on someone I hardly know,
to fornicate in their home.

22:47.292 --> 22:50.137
Get over it. It's perfectly normal.

22:53.079 --> 22:55.146
— Tada!
— Wow!

22:57.569 --> 23:00.440
There are all sorts of useful
things in that drawer there,

23:00.466 --> 23:02.253
if you guys feel like exploring.

23:02.394 --> 23:05.219
That's okay, I'll bring
my own sheets and towels.

23:05.344 --> 23:07.144
No. Everything will be provided.

23:07.456 --> 23:10.969
I'm really honored that you asked me.
It'll be great karma for the house.

23:11.024 --> 23:12.922
Great karma for the house?!

23:13.824 --> 23:17.582
My God, the pressure, already.
I can't stand it.

23:26.112 --> 23:27.053
Hey, this is Tony.

23:27.469 --> 23:30.677
Hi, this is Laura White.
Is Cheryl in, please?

23:31.250 --> 23:32.210
Cheryl!

23:32.419 --> 23:34.059
— What is it?
— Phone!

23:34.959 --> 23:36.130
She's coming.

23:44.107 --> 23:45.333
I'm not your girlfriend.

23:45.367 --> 23:47.578
When someone calls, particularly
someone you don't know,

23:47.592 --> 23:49.202
you can use the word 'Mom'.

23:50.037 --> 23:51.396
Hullo, this is Cheryl.

23:51.474 --> 23:52.526
Hi, it's Laura.

23:52.538 --> 23:54.030
I haven't heard from you for a while.

23:54.036 --> 23:55.374
How are you?
— Pretty well.

23:55.516 --> 23:57.576
Look, I called to ask
how you would feel,

23:57.604 --> 24:00.467
about working with a
severely disabled client.

24:01.311 --> 24:02.240
I'm…

24:02.442 --> 24:04.242
Could you hold on one second.

24:04.767 --> 24:06.760
Tony! Get a glass!

24:11.689 --> 24:13.249
Hey, cut that out!

24:13.895 --> 24:15.695
Hullo, Mark O'Brien's phone.

24:17.029 --> 24:19.886
Hi, this is Cheryl Cohen–Greene.
May I speak to Mark?

24:27.399 --> 24:30.175
I—Uh—yeah, could you hold a second?

24:31.131 --> 24:33.062
What? What am I doing here? Yes or no?

24:33.570 --> 24:35.130
Come on, make up your mind.

24:41.207 --> 24:42.767
Yeah, go ahead.

24:44.344 --> 24:47.310
— Hello, this is Mark.
— Hi Mark, this is Cheryl.

24:47.580 --> 24:49.294
Laura called to introduce you.

24:49.365 --> 24:51.831
I understand you'd like to meet,
is that right?

24:52.910 --> 24:54.030
Uh…

24:55.097 --> 24:56.297
Yes.

24:56.601 --> 24:59.942
I could see you on the
thirteenth, at eleven o'clock.

25:00.107 --> 25:01.716
Would that be any good for you?

25:01.917 --> 25:03.317
Oh, uh…

25:06.515 --> 25:08.915
Yes, I think that would be fine for me.

25:08.984 --> 25:10.181
Where you from?

25:10.533 --> 25:12.290
Boston. You?

25:12.713 --> 25:15.124
— Salem. Small world.
— Uh.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.013
We will talk for a while to begin with,

25:18.055 --> 25:21.607
and then, when you're ready, we'll start
doing some body awareness exercises.

25:25.903 --> 25:27.533
Holy Mother of God.

25:30.433 --> 25:33.571
What are “body awareness exercises"?

25:48.317 --> 25:50.514
— Which one?
— Doesn't matter.

25:51.597 --> 25:54.204
Will you stop acting like you're
going to your own execution.

25:54.393 --> 25:55.953
I'm not acting.

26:01.270 --> 26:02.806
Okay, the purple one.

26:04.824 --> 26:06.624
Just try and think about something else.

26:06.865 --> 26:08.738
Baseball, for example.

26:09.144 --> 26:11.048
That's what they usually tell boys to do.

26:11.113 --> 26:14.962
Baseball. You mean like hope
I make it to second base?

26:15.454 --> 26:16.968
That's helpful.

26:17.030 --> 26:18.980
Okay. Right, be like that.

26:20.004 --> 26:21.404
Alright.

26:26.570 --> 26:28.130
Maybe she forgot.

26:28.932 --> 26:32.523
Yeah, she forgot, or she got the date
wrong, we should just forget it.

26:33.098 --> 26:35.211
Let's go back. Come on.

26:35.322 --> 26:37.796
She has not forgotten.
You see?

26:38.531 --> 26:39.591
Hi.

26:40.481 --> 26:41.622
Hi.

26:57.907 --> 26:59.663
Okay, I'm going.

26:59.688 --> 27:00.771
I'll be back around one,

27:00.783 --> 27:03.888
but if you guys have finished early,
you can just let yourselves out. Okay?

27:03.929 --> 27:05.749
— Okay.
— Have fun.

27:05.819 --> 27:07.219
Thanks, bye.

27:07.921 --> 27:09.041
Bye.

27:15.452 --> 27:17.012
What time is it?

27:18.963 --> 27:19.993
Twelve after eleven.

27:20.016 --> 27:23.274
Oh, I think there's a strong possibility
she's had second thoughts.

27:24.494 --> 27:27.018
And if she does arrive, she would
be perfectly within her rights

27:27.035 --> 27:28.374
to turn around and run.

28:03.573 --> 28:06.753
Hi, I'm Cheryl. I'm sorry I'm late.

28:06.803 --> 28:10.378
No, that's fine. Come in.
I'm Vera, I'm one of Mark's helpers.

28:10.402 --> 28:13.290
— Nice to meet you.
— Nice to meet you too.

28:21.069 --> 28:22.629
Hi, Mark O’Brien.

28:24.268 --> 28:25.828
Hi, Cheryl Cohen Greene.

28:26.133 --> 28:28.154
I'll be back, in say, two hours?

28:28.221 --> 28:30.621
— Yes, perfect.
— Okay.

28:36.253 --> 28:36.985
So…

28:37.077 --> 28:38.877
Your money's on the desk, over there.

28:41.384 --> 28:43.696
Yes it is. Thank you.

28:45.448 --> 28:47.275
That was the wrong way to start off.

28:47.299 --> 28:49.359
It really was. Shall we start again?

28:49.456 --> 28:51.484
Please, you start.

28:52.672 --> 28:56.122
Although the aim is for us
to have sex, I'm not a prostitute.

28:56.178 --> 28:59.347
You don't have to pay me up front.
I’ve nothing against prostitutes,

28:59.386 --> 29:02.386
but there’s a difference.
We can talk about that later.

29:02.491 --> 29:03.691
I'm sorry.

29:03.798 --> 29:07.545
The other thing is, there's a limit to
the number of sessions we can have.

29:07.569 --> 29:10.038
Did Laura mention that when you saw her?

29:10.108 --> 29:12.851
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

29:12.930 --> 29:16.960
The limit is six. That gives us
plenty of opportunity to explore.

29:17.523 --> 29:20.613
So, I understand you are
able to have an erection.

29:21.365 --> 29:23.165
Yes, but not by choice.

29:23.430 --> 29:24.805
Do you know how many men there are

29:24.832 --> 29:27.039
who would give anything
for a natural erection?

29:27.733 --> 29:28.998
Is this your place?

29:29.193 --> 29:30.753
No, it's a friend's.

29:31.526 --> 29:34.932
The only bedroom furniture I have
at my place is an iron lung.

29:35.753 --> 29:40.172
I've been wondering maybe
about possibly buying a futon,

29:40.737 --> 29:42.641
yeah, in case the need arose.

29:42.711 --> 29:44.109
Might be worth thinking about.

29:44.165 --> 29:45.725
I've got the space, I think.

29:46.084 --> 29:48.484
It can be expensive though, a nice…

29:49.257 --> 29:51.848
futon, I mean, how much do you
think a good one would cost—

29:51.889 --> 29:54.289
Mark, take a deep breath…

29:58.507 --> 29:59.627
then let go.

30:02.288 --> 30:03.848
Do I seem anxious?

30:04.520 --> 30:05.629
You do a little.

30:06.861 --> 30:10.718
So Laura tells me you're a poet.
What's it like to be a poet?

30:12.015 --> 30:14.385
It's a way of living
inside your own head,

30:14.386 --> 30:16.590
which is where I spend most of my time.

30:16.793 --> 30:17.993
But not today.

30:18.891 --> 30:20.691
Nice shirt, by the way.

30:21.630 --> 30:22.575
Thank you.

30:22.845 --> 30:25.483
So I'm gonna ask you
some basic questions, okay?

30:25.858 --> 30:26.818
Sure.

30:26.895 --> 30:31.564
Explain to me, so that I really understand
exactly what the iron lung is for?

30:31.744 --> 30:33.304
Well, it keeps me breathing.

30:33.976 --> 30:36.958
I can spend a few hours outside of it,
with my portable respirator,

30:36.983 --> 30:39.082
depending on how I feel, but…

30:39.738 --> 30:42.138
I work and sleep in the iron lung.

30:44.064 --> 30:45.864
And how do you feel right now?

30:45.962 --> 30:47.522
Out of my league.

30:48.769 --> 30:50.329
I meant your breathing.

30:50.364 --> 30:52.026
Oh… fine.

30:52.565 --> 30:54.223
In fact, better than usual.

30:54.450 --> 30:56.424
That’s great.
Shall we get undressed?

31:17.549 --> 31:20.148
Do you have any areas
of unusual sensitivity?

31:20.245 --> 31:22.687
Any parts of your body
you don’t want me to touch?

31:22.820 --> 31:25.220
I have normal sensitivity all over.

31:25.710 --> 31:29.973
I'm not paralyzed exactly, it’s just
my muscles don’t work too much.

31:32.650 --> 31:35.155
— You can touch me anywhere.
— That's great.

31:38.531 --> 31:40.302
Ow! Ow! Stop! It hurts!

31:40.318 --> 31:42.327
— What, what's wrong?
— Holy Mother of God!

31:42.604 --> 31:44.971
— My fingers! My fingers, they're caught!
— It's okay, okay.

31:44.995 --> 31:47.409
I've got it, I've got you.
Don't worry.

31:47.823 --> 31:49.383
Be careful, please.

31:51.735 --> 31:52.855
Mark…

31:53.459 --> 31:55.859
I'm gonna be really careful with you.

31:56.782 --> 31:59.516
I don't want to hurt or
injure you in any way,

32:00.845 --> 32:03.835
and it’s really not sexy
when you yell at me. Okay?

32:06.341 --> 32:08.141
I won't yell at you any more.

32:08.304 --> 32:13.261
But you’ll tell me calmly the
moment anything starts to hurt.

32:13.982 --> 32:14.942
Yes.

32:18.487 --> 32:19.542
Here we go.

32:22.125 --> 32:23.732
Piece of cake, uh?

32:36.210 --> 32:37.410
Nice shirt.

32:37.743 --> 32:39.303
You already said that.

32:40.460 --> 32:41.420
Did I?

32:59.144 --> 33:00.563
I'm gonna slide these down.

33:00.564 --> 33:03.329
Okay, just be careful with my feet,
okay. My feet, be careful.

33:03.365 --> 33:04.995
— Hold your breath.
— Okay.

33:05.058 --> 33:07.847
Oh, hang out, be careful,
that's a new pant!

33:32.700 --> 33:33.660
You're ready?

33:34.793 --> 33:35.753
Oh.

33:37.046 --> 33:38.446
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

33:40.596 --> 33:43.700
So the difference between
me and a prostitute

33:43.719 --> 33:46.935
is the prostitute wants
your return business. I don't.

33:47.427 --> 33:50.466
I’m here to help you learn
about your sexual feelings,

33:50.490 --> 33:52.589
so you can share them
with a future partner.

33:53.683 --> 33:55.714
Mark, I want you to tell me

33:56.432 --> 34:00.195
how it feels each time I touch
a different part of your body. Okay?

34:00.906 --> 34:05.677
Well, whenever I'm naked, everyone
else in the room is always dressed.

34:06.192 --> 34:09.813
And now that I'm in bed with another
naked person, it's rather confusing.

34:09.944 --> 34:11.313
Why is it confusing?

34:11.409 --> 34:13.510
I'd always expected that God, or

34:13.597 --> 34:17.243
my parents, would intervene to keep
this moment from ever happening.

34:17.282 --> 34:18.681
Not this time.

34:20.185 --> 34:22.732
So if something feels good, you tell me,

34:22.757 --> 34:25.757
if something feels ticklish or bothers
you, I want you to let me know,

34:25.774 --> 34:28.174
I don’t want you to tolerate anything.

34:29.212 --> 34:31.310
I’m gonna start with the top of your head.

34:38.695 --> 34:40.255
Soft hair.

34:41.888 --> 34:43.784
It’s really nice to the touch.

34:44.010 --> 34:46.275
— Does it feel good?
— It does.

34:59.114 --> 35:00.674
That feels weird.

35:01.353 --> 35:03.229
Weird good or weird bad?

35:03.385 --> 35:04.585
Just weird.

35:11.558 --> 35:12.518
Feels good.

35:14.114 --> 35:15.314
Still good?

35:15.337 --> 35:17.737
Everything good so far, except the ear.

35:19.141 --> 35:21.209
Are these the body awareness exercises?

35:21.233 --> 35:23.178
You're clever to have worked that out.

35:23.210 --> 35:25.610
People tell me I'm very perceptive.

35:27.038 --> 35:29.438
Mark, would you like
to see what I feel like?

35:58.701 --> 36:01.441
You touch one, you have to touch
the other, it's sort of a war.

36:01.933 --> 36:03.053
Okay.

36:06.145 --> 36:07.705
Αrе yоu wеаrіng соlоgnе?

36:07.805 --> 36:08.765
Yes.

36:09.019 --> 36:12.066
I like it. I usually like
cologne. And I like that.

36:14.353 --> 36:17.353
So Mark, I’m going to move my
hand along your body…

36:18.173 --> 36:20.803
down to your penis, and if you feel me…

36:20.842 --> 36:21.802
Oh!

36:22.913 --> 36:24.033
Ooh…

36:26.398 --> 36:28.497
— Nice job.
— Yeah.

36:29.218 --> 36:31.318
I thought there'd be more to it.

36:32.132 --> 36:33.932
Not that it was unpleasant.

36:34.392 --> 36:36.792
After all, I was in bed
with a naked woman.

36:38.387 --> 36:41.275
She complimented me on
my shirt and my hair.

36:42.177 --> 36:43.737
She held my penis.

36:44.955 --> 36:47.955
I haven't even seen my penis
for over thirty years.

36:49.563 --> 36:51.748
Am I sharing too much, Father?

36:51.916 --> 36:54.459
No, I’m used to it.

37:04.270 --> 37:06.799
So, uhm, next week.

37:07.131 --> 37:09.869
Friday the twentieth, same time?

37:10.052 --> 37:11.612
That's good for me.

37:11.637 --> 37:14.037
Next time we'll start
to work on intercourse.

37:16.549 --> 37:18.468
Were you afraid at the
thought of seeing me?

37:18.533 --> 37:20.585
Oh God, I was terrified.

37:21.453 --> 37:25.069
You should be proud of yourself.
You did great, we've made real progress.

37:25.177 --> 37:26.435
Can I ask you something?

37:26.482 --> 37:28.013
Sure. What would you like to ask?

37:28.060 --> 37:29.362
Anything, really.

37:30.095 --> 37:32.143
Just tell me something about yourself.

37:32.787 --> 37:33.827
Anything.

37:33.944 --> 37:34.904
Okay.

37:35.115 --> 37:37.909
I'm a very private person.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.167
I have a private life, I need you to
be aware of that, but that's about it.

37:42.568 --> 37:44.870
This therapy is about you.
— Hello.

37:45.415 --> 37:46.615
Welcome back.

37:47.417 --> 37:48.508
Perfect timing.

37:48.538 --> 37:50.938
I hope you guys kept the noise down.

37:59.303 --> 38:00.863
What was it like, how do you feel?

38:01.871 --> 38:04.668
Cleansed and victorious.

38:04.899 --> 38:06.699
Doesn't get any better than that.

38:07.822 --> 38:09.461
How about your first time?

38:09.554 --> 38:11.858
— Don't wanna remember that.
— How was it like?

38:13.085 --> 38:14.885
It wasn't all that pleasant.

38:15.260 --> 38:18.789
I mean, it was consensual and everything,
and I really was in love with the guy,

38:18.951 --> 38:22.370
but his dick seemed enormous
to me, I didn't think it would fit.

38:22.503 --> 38:23.823
It was scary.

38:24.509 --> 38:27.163
He was nice.
I guess he couldn't help it.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.350
Was he Chinese?

38:29.412 --> 38:32.061
Are you kidding? I only hung out
with white guys at high school.

38:32.284 --> 38:33.406
Why is that?

38:33.524 --> 38:35.719
I don't know. To stick it to
my mum and dad, I suppose.

38:35.767 --> 38:38.484
Are they happy now you
have a Chinese boyfriend?

38:38.524 --> 38:40.342
They're happy, I'm happy.

38:41.204 --> 38:42.764
What's his dick like?

38:43.342 --> 38:45.128
Uh, perfect size.

38:45.791 --> 38:48.410
Why do you call it a
dick instead of a penis?

38:50.301 --> 38:52.536
Penis sounds like some vegetable
you don't want to eat.

38:52.559 --> 38:54.881
— Huh huh.
— Dick sounds like what it is.

38:57.809 --> 38:59.377
The thing is…

39:00.639 --> 39:02.908
it was all over so damn quickly.

39:05.004 --> 39:07.345
Yeah, tell me about it.

39:15.088 --> 39:16.288
First session.

39:16.671 --> 39:21.082
Mark O'Brien is the oldest of four
children and raised Catholic.

39:21.694 --> 39:23.832
He was extremely nervous.

39:24.455 --> 39:28.296
He yelled a lot when I took off his shirt,
but I think more out of fear than pain.

39:29.071 --> 39:33.287
He cannot masturbate, he's had only
the occasional kissing experience.

39:33.843 --> 39:36.317
He is capable of achieving
an erection easily,

39:36.342 --> 39:38.291
but the unusual curvature of his body

39:38.292 --> 39:40.598
could be a serious
obstacle to intercourse.

40:16.592 --> 40:18.992
I just started working
with this gentleman,

40:19.038 --> 40:23.824
he spends almost his entire life
trapped in a big metal box.

40:27.162 --> 40:28.962
Did you hear what I said?

40:31.988 --> 40:34.321
Yes. Yes.

40:35.756 --> 40:38.165
You’re a saint.

40:58.364 --> 41:00.807
“Sometimes the head of
the penis may be too large

41:00.852 --> 41:03.604
to penetrate the vaginal
opening smoothly,

41:04.564 --> 41:10.007
in which case the application of
lubricant is recommended to avoid

41:10.968 --> 41:13.794
possible…” Oh, my God!

41:17.117 --> 41:20.333
So, what's on the menu today?

41:20.840 --> 41:22.807
We're attempting intercourse.

41:22.936 --> 41:24.926
Uh-huh. A big one.

41:25.137 --> 41:28.090
What do you think of it?
Intercourse.

41:29.879 --> 41:31.679
Overrated, but necessary.

41:32.679 --> 41:35.497
There's plenty of other ways
of achieving the same result,

41:35.569 --> 41:39.348
but somehow you don't feel you've actually
done it till you've gone all the way in.

41:47.044 --> 41:49.444
I want you to look at me this time.

41:51.154 --> 41:53.636
Come on, give it a try, open your eyes.

41:59.229 --> 42:01.029
Do you like watching me undress?

42:01.872 --> 42:02.964
I do.

42:06.956 --> 42:08.494
So from now on…

42:09.046 --> 42:12.703
you’re gonna start to listen
to the signals from your body…

42:13.090 --> 42:15.158
that way you'll be able
to have some control…

42:16.314 --> 42:17.274
Oh God!

42:17.843 --> 42:18.803
Damn!

42:20.936 --> 42:21.896
Shit.

42:23.418 --> 42:24.978
I did it again.

42:26.128 --> 42:28.528
This time, I ejaculated on her thigh.

42:31.616 --> 42:33.436
I felt cursed…

42:34.461 --> 42:36.677
that the whole enterprise was cursed.

42:37.673 --> 42:40.435
It seemed like a totally just punishment.

42:40.620 --> 42:43.691
God wasn't actually denying my sexuality.

42:44.700 --> 42:47.700
He was just pointing out to me
how useless it was.

42:50.048 --> 42:53.671
It's amazing to me how often God
is brought into the sex act.

42:54.967 --> 42:56.710
I understand that even
amongst nonbelievers.

42:56.728 --> 43:00.749
the most common expression
of sexual ecstasy is “Oh, God!”

43:04.016 --> 43:07.169
Okay, I don't want to hear any
more about God cursing you.

43:07.431 --> 43:08.585
I want the credit.

43:08.616 --> 43:12.613
It was my overpowering beauty
that did it, it took you by surprise.

43:12.732 --> 43:14.699
Now, where were we?

43:15.697 --> 43:17.497
What do you mean, where were we?

43:17.753 --> 43:19.553
I’m gonna touch you…

43:21.013 --> 43:22.573
I’m touching you…

43:23.956 --> 43:26.375
and when we both feel you’re aroused…

43:27.313 --> 43:28.713
like now…

43:28.914 --> 43:30.583
I’m gonna guide you inside me.

43:30.607 --> 43:32.407
Is there anything I need to do?

43:33.584 --> 43:38.441
Just close your eyes, feel your body,
that's all you need to do.

43:44.919 --> 43:48.745
— No, it won't fit. It's not going to fit.
— No. Mark, it will fit just fine.

43:48.894 --> 43:52.188
— No, it's dangerous. It's too big.
— It's not too big. Relax.

43:52.220 --> 43:56.803
— No. It won't fit. It'll hurt.
— Mark! Mark! Stop. Stop.

43:57.341 --> 44:01.260
I promise you, nothing bad will happen.

44:02.358 --> 44:04.758
Let's try again while you're still hard.

44:10.713 --> 44:13.054
Shit! Shit!

44:15.219 --> 44:16.339
Shit.

44:19.327 --> 44:20.887
I'm really sorry.

44:21.258 --> 44:22.640
Stop being sorry.

44:22.787 --> 44:25.578
And stop reading those stupid sex manuals.

44:29.462 --> 44:31.784
There's still some time left, we can talk.

44:32.663 --> 44:36.067
or you can suck my nipples,
that went well.

44:37.261 --> 44:39.661
Or, which would you like to do first?

44:41.008 --> 44:45.146
I believe the root of his anxiety
is his parents and his religion.

44:45.531 --> 44:47.931
He believes he doesn't deserve sex.

44:48.127 --> 44:51.288
He believes he is responsible for his
little sister's death at the age of seven,

44:51.306 --> 44:53.405
because his mother was
too busy looking after him.

44:55.568 --> 44:58.855
We discussed his fantasies,
which were mostly masochistic.

44:58.894 --> 45:00.862
Again, the idea of being punished.

45:02.186 --> 45:07.604
He's never seen female genitalia before,
and seems quite frightened or sort of it.

45:08.677 --> 45:11.077
My worry now is that
it's never gonna happen.

45:11.929 --> 45:14.929
I'm never gonna have intercourse
with Cheryl, or any other woman.

45:15.491 --> 45:17.891
Maybe intercourse would
prove I was an adult.

45:19.484 --> 45:21.884
Maybe I don't want to cross that line.

45:22.576 --> 45:23.976
Maybe…

45:24.635 --> 45:26.435
this was a bad idea.

45:28.432 --> 45:30.232
Do you want to know what I think?

45:30.385 --> 45:31.345
Please.

45:32.639 --> 45:34.439
Forget the psychobabble.

45:35.002 --> 45:39.007
I grew up on a farm. Even the animals
need a couple of times to get it right.

45:39.663 --> 45:42.063
May I suggest you try it
and enjoy it more?

45:43.063 --> 45:45.028
Don't worry about the technical stuff.

45:45.361 --> 45:46.561
You're a poet.

45:47.686 --> 45:48.886
Be romantic.

45:57.573 --> 45:58.693
No.

46:01.265 --> 46:02.385
Uh maybe.

46:06.890 --> 46:08.990
Uh yes. Thanks, it's good.

46:16.699 --> 46:19.301
— You nervous?
— A little.

46:20.205 --> 46:22.485
— Want a shpritz?
— Yes, of course I would.

46:31.156 --> 46:35.232
I have a good feeling about
today, a very good feeling.

46:35.359 --> 46:35.997
Good.

46:36.067 --> 46:38.244
I had a terrible feeling it
was never going to happen,

46:38.250 --> 46:39.939
but I think today's the day.

46:39.963 --> 46:42.385
— Can I make a suggestion?
— Please.

46:43.590 --> 46:45.150
Stop thinking about it.

46:47.525 --> 46:49.585
Couldn't have wished for nicer weather.

46:49.643 --> 46:52.335
You're not listening, are you?
Stop thinking about it.

46:52.382 --> 46:53.942
Beautiful weather.

47:09.442 --> 47:10.908
Oh, my God, Mark!

47:11.479 --> 47:14.486
I'm so sorry. I forgot.

47:18.648 --> 47:20.208
She was very apologetic.

47:21.215 --> 47:24.408
Look, it may not be exactly
what we had in mind, but

47:24.456 --> 47:27.571
I noticed a couple of blocks
from here a pretty nice motel.

47:27.601 --> 47:29.401
It might be worth checking out.

47:30.142 --> 47:31.542
Why not.

47:45.967 --> 47:48.285
Do you have anything on the ground floor?

47:49.007 --> 47:50.567
I've got a single.

47:50.793 --> 47:52.892
— How much?
— Thirty-five plus tax.

47:54.765 --> 47:57.128
My boss is the gentleman in the gurney.

47:57.160 --> 47:59.680
He's supposed to be having a
therapy session right now,

47:59.706 --> 48:02.430
but the facility we normally
use had a scheduling mix-up.

48:02.508 --> 48:06.137
We just need the room for two hours.
Can you do it twenty cash?

48:09.855 --> 48:11.798
So there's a soda machine
around the corner.

48:11.825 --> 48:12.634
Thanks.

48:12.658 --> 48:15.754
— And an ice machine if you need it.
— I'm sure it'll come in handy.

48:29.705 --> 48:31.265
Okay, that's it.

48:32.502 --> 48:35.656
I've got a book to read. I'll be hanging
around the reception if you need me.

48:36.008 --> 48:37.128
Thanks.

48:45.415 --> 48:47.026
Very atmospheric.

48:48.052 --> 48:50.237
Some people find motels exciting.

48:51.914 --> 48:53.838
Do you think I could be
one of those people?

48:53.886 --> 48:55.286
Of course.

49:05.587 --> 49:06.746
Another shirt.

49:06.818 --> 49:08.785
As in racy and sophisticated?

49:08.864 --> 49:11.264
You took the words right out of my mouth.

49:15.866 --> 49:17.666
What's wrong with your boss?

49:20.189 --> 49:22.589
Basically, he can only move his head.

49:24.547 --> 49:25.667
So uh…

49:26.236 --> 49:28.281
What sort of therapy are they doing?

49:29.393 --> 49:30.953
They're having sex.

49:35.960 --> 49:37.520
You're shitting me.

49:37.824 --> 49:40.200
Okay, I'm shitting you.

49:40.489 --> 49:42.408
Oh no, come on, tell me for real.

49:43.216 --> 49:44.971
What are they actually doing?

49:46.205 --> 49:49.422
Well, today, after some
appropriate foreplay,

49:49.487 --> 49:51.586
they're gonna try to
achieve full penetration.

50:07.157 --> 50:08.277
Are you okay down there?

50:08.886 --> 50:10.438
I'm choking.

50:11.561 --> 50:13.605
— Oh my God.
— The mouth piece.

50:14.493 --> 50:16.313
The mouth pi—

50:16.590 --> 50:17.990
Thank you.

50:27.391 --> 50:30.391
I guess that one's off the
menu until further notice.

50:43.105 --> 50:45.376
Come on, lighten up.

50:52.395 --> 50:58.637
Pony girl, Pony girl, won't
you be my pony girl?

50:59.924 --> 51:04.186
My dad used to sing that to my
little sister Karin before she died.

51:06.371 --> 51:09.557
She was kind of a sad little girl.
It didn't do much good.

51:10.405 --> 51:15.402
I'm really sorry that the last time I saw
her, I fought with her, I made her cry.

51:20.171 --> 51:23.171
My parents could have left me
in the nursing home, you know.

51:25.163 --> 51:29.051
But they found out the average
life expectancy for polios

51:30.142 --> 51:32.578
in nursing homes was 18 months.

51:35.973 --> 51:37.533
They took me home.

51:39.550 --> 51:41.110
They gave me a life.

51:43.679 --> 51:45.029
They gave up theirs.

51:46.399 --> 51:50.880
Mark, I'm just going to go the
bathroom for a quick pee.

51:50.970 --> 51:54.834
And when I come back, we're
going to achieve full penetration.

51:54.976 --> 51:57.376
But before I go, I want
you to close your eyes.

51:57.744 --> 52:00.420
— Is this a game?
— It's not a game, just do as I say.

52:00.436 --> 52:01.996
Close your eyes.

52:10.073 --> 52:13.073
Picture yourself as a six
year old boy at the beach.

52:14.613 --> 52:16.173
Can you do that?

52:18.601 --> 52:21.377
Yes, very easily.

52:22.152 --> 52:23.952
Describe some of your feelings.

52:25.245 --> 52:26.836
I feel exhilarated…

52:29.319 --> 52:31.500
running along the Atlantic Ocean…

52:32.900 --> 52:34.305
feeling the wind and…

52:35.498 --> 52:37.820
the wet sand between my toes.

52:38.730 --> 52:40.530
Do you really feel like him?

52:41.117 --> 52:43.487
Yes, I really feel like him.

52:43.635 --> 52:45.956
And can you really picture him?

52:46.438 --> 52:47.774
I don't understand what you mean,

52:47.805 --> 52:50.524
I said I can feel like him.
Of course I can picture him.

52:50.626 --> 52:56.022
From the outside, I mean as
an adult, as you are now,

52:56.833 --> 53:02.416
looking at him with his crew
cut and his little face?

53:10.981 --> 53:11.941
Yes.

53:13.572 --> 53:15.132
And are you mad at him?

53:17.116 --> 53:20.423
Do you blame him for getting polio?

53:24.204 --> 53:25.764
Was it his fault?

53:56.454 --> 54:00.054
She either forgot to close the bathroom
door, or didn't bother to close it.

54:01.326 --> 54:04.542
I found the sound of her peeing
incredibly erotic,

54:05.115 --> 54:08.698
and the sound of her tearing off toilet
paper incredibly intimate.

54:10.412 --> 54:13.724
By the time she came back
I had a terrific boner.

54:21.805 --> 54:22.925
Go on.

54:23.703 --> 54:26.903
I'm gonna rub the tip of
your penis around my vulva.

54:27.296 --> 54:30.364
And when it's ready, I'll guide you in.

54:31.251 --> 54:35.662
Breathe slowly and think
of something delicious.

54:53.646 --> 54:55.214
Aah–Aahh!

55:13.462 --> 55:15.262
They've been a long time.

55:16.788 --> 55:17.908
Yeah.

55:21.761 --> 55:23.831
— You got a boyfriend?
— Yes.

55:27.829 --> 55:31.756
I grew up in Salem,
raised Catholic, like you,

55:31.781 --> 55:35.778
but the church did not appreciate
my attitude towards sex.

55:36.270 --> 55:40.002
— You had an attitude towards sex?
— I did, I liked it.

55:40.277 --> 55:43.032
They think they threw me out,
but I threw them out.

55:43.098 --> 55:47.767
So for years I didn't believe in anything,
and now I'm converting to Judaism.

55:48.229 --> 55:50.629
I guess it's good to have
some kind of insurance.

55:50.964 --> 55:52.524
Oh, I didn’t think of that.

55:52.579 --> 55:53.930
Then why are you doing it?

55:54.033 --> 55:57.188
My husband asked me to do it
before his grandmother dies.

55:58.423 --> 56:03.616
The idea is, if it makes her happy and
him happy, it will do the same for me.

56:03.769 --> 56:06.901
The fact that I’m happy already,
doesn’t seem to be relevant.

56:07.300 --> 56:08.680
What does your husband do?

56:08.810 --> 56:10.370
He's a philosopher.

56:10.501 --> 56:11.938
Wow! At the university?

56:12.032 --> 56:13.592
No, in his own mind.

56:14.420 --> 56:19.665
He runs the house, plays
guitar, thinks a lot.

56:27.403 --> 56:28.963
It's getting late.

56:38.101 --> 56:41.825
Look, you did great today.
You were fantastic.

56:42.076 --> 56:46.081
You're a fully fledged male
homo-sapiens endowed

56:46.114 --> 56:50.494
with a handsome and substantial penis
which now has a proven track record.

56:51.221 --> 56:52.643
You should be thrilled.

56:52.932 --> 56:54.698
Was I really inside you?

56:54.912 --> 56:58.128
You were really and truly inside me.

56:58.269 --> 57:00.784
— For how long?
— At least five or six seconds.

57:01.363 --> 57:02.563
Is that all?

57:02.679 --> 57:05.079
That's a long time for some people.

57:05.508 --> 57:08.577
You were pretty excited, I don't
know what you were thinking about.

57:08.662 --> 57:12.761
Yeah, it's you—

57:13.505 --> 57:17.909
It was—these all a jumble of sensations.

57:17.980 --> 57:21.686
Well, you definitely achieved penetration.

57:22.093 --> 57:27.293
It was penis–vagina all the way, and
you definitely get an A for orgasm.

57:31.015 --> 57:32.135
Cheryl?

57:35.585 --> 57:36.785
Did you come?

57:38.627 --> 57:40.187
No, Mark, I didn't.

57:40.710 --> 57:42.510
Can we try for that next time?

57:45.223 --> 57:46.783
Is that what you want?

57:47.846 --> 57:48.966
Yes…

57:50.008 --> 57:51.568
that's what I want.

57:53.747 --> 57:54.947
Okay then.

58:07.703 --> 58:09.263
How's it going?

58:10.500 --> 58:12.872
— Hi, how you doing?
— Good, good, come on in.

58:13.537 --> 58:15.644
— How are ya?
— Still exhausted.

58:15.776 --> 58:17.691
— Beer?
— No, I'm okay.

58:17.738 --> 58:19.612
— Oh you need a glass?
— That'd be great.

58:21.048 --> 58:22.168
So…

58:23.197 --> 58:25.616
On reflection, how do you feel?

58:26.157 --> 58:27.357
It was okay.

58:27.492 --> 58:30.083
I liked some of the other stuff,
this is just as much or better,

58:30.102 --> 58:31.638
but I'm glad it's behind me.

58:31.722 --> 58:34.115
So am I. Congratulations.

58:34.282 --> 58:36.102
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

58:37.462 --> 58:40.303
When this is all over, I'm gonna
write an article about it.

58:40.367 --> 58:42.241
After all, sex sells.

58:42.662 --> 58:43.862
Seriously.

58:44.608 --> 58:46.691
So you're only doing this for the money.

58:46.811 --> 58:48.011
Oh, absolutely.

58:48.199 --> 58:51.199
That makes me feel so much
better about everything.

58:51.957 --> 58:55.798
What is she like? Cheryl. You've
never really said anything about her.

58:56.853 --> 58:59.253
She's the most wonderful
person on the planet.

59:00.765 --> 59:01.803
How is it going?

59:01.952 --> 59:05.762
He reads too many books. He has it in
his head that after meeting three times,

59:05.781 --> 59:10.474
we should be able to have penetrative
sex which results in simultaneous orgasm,

59:10.521 --> 59:11.706
Boom! Just like that.

59:11.933 --> 59:13.440
That's very funny.

59:13.667 --> 59:15.067
Yeah I guess it is.

59:15.636 --> 59:17.300
What do you think of him?

59:19.410 --> 59:20.530
Cheryl?

59:21.738 --> 59:23.138
I like him.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.560
What are you thinking about?

59:45.326 --> 59:46.526
Nothing.

59:49.946 --> 59:51.506
I don't believe you.

59:53.826 --> 59:56.826
Okay, I was just thinking about
the whole conversion thing.

59:59.465 --> 01:00:01.048
I still don't believe you.

01:00:10.551 --> 01:00:15.814
Then, whatever it is, I guess I’m
not in the mood for talking about it.

01:00:20.754 --> 01:00:21.874
So?

01:00:23.965 --> 01:00:25.525
What do you think?

01:00:36.313 --> 01:00:37.873
Hullo, this is Cheryl.

01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:39.210
Hey.

01:00:40.987 --> 01:00:42.297
— Mark?
— Hey.

01:00:42.336 --> 01:00:44.736
Can we meet somewhere for coffee?

01:00:46.063 --> 01:00:48.474
Somewhere nice. My treat.

01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:53.646
I don't usually meet with clients
outside of working hours, you know that.

01:00:54.258 --> 01:00:56.358
We'll have to talk business.

01:01:00.678 --> 01:01:04.832
Mark appears to be indulging in
typical transference behavior.

01:01:05.373 --> 01:01:08.878
We know this is not unusual
after first successful intercourse,

01:01:08.896 --> 01:01:11.596
but I think he is
particularly susceptible.

01:01:23.427 --> 01:01:28.213
He cannot help seeing me as the
multi-functional, all-purpose woman,

01:01:28.433 --> 01:01:32.719
mother, sister, schoolmistress,
whore, lover and best friend.

01:01:33.328 --> 01:01:38.357
At the same time, his anxiety about
sexual performance has diminished.

01:01:54.063 --> 01:01:55.748
You look stunning.

01:02:01.097 --> 01:02:02.579
— Thank you.
— You're welcome.

01:02:02.626 --> 01:02:05.006
Could you put my cup
right on the edge there.

01:02:05.126 --> 01:02:05.998
Sure.

01:02:06.339 --> 01:02:08.248
Right on the edge.

01:02:08.603 --> 01:02:10.843
And stick the straw
in my mouth, please?

01:02:12.047 --> 01:02:13.851
— Is that okay?
— Perfect.

01:02:14.506 --> 01:02:17.028
Sir, I'd wait a couple of minutes.
That coffee is kind of hot.

01:02:17.691 --> 01:02:19.623
— Thanks.
— You're welcome.

01:02:21.528 --> 01:02:22.963
So, what shall we talk about?

01:02:23.034 --> 01:02:24.834
We don't have to do much talking.

01:02:25.953 --> 01:02:28.353
I just want to be seen with you in public.

01:02:29.615 --> 01:02:33.249
And I want people to say “hey, who’s
that gimp with that beautiful blonde?

01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:35.624
How did he get so lucky?”

01:02:41.198 --> 01:02:44.016
If some old girlfriend from
school you hadn’t seen for years

01:02:44.034 --> 01:02:48.289
showed up here suddenly, like right
now, how would you introduce me?

01:02:49.843 --> 01:02:51.403
As your boyfriend?

01:02:52.293 --> 01:02:53.853
As my husband.

01:02:54.299 --> 01:02:55.859
Why not go all the way.

01:02:58.343 --> 01:02:59.622
Really?

01:02:59.747 --> 01:03:01.567
We're pretending, right?

01:03:03.036 --> 01:03:04.596
So…

01:03:06.095 --> 01:03:07.055
Sure.

01:03:12.252 --> 01:03:14.070
Love poem for…

01:03:15.687 --> 01:03:16.807
for uh…

01:03:18.202 --> 01:03:20.022
No one in particular.

01:03:21.725 --> 01:03:23.125
Tell me…

01:03:24.257 --> 01:03:25.657
Tell me…

01:03:26.989 --> 01:03:29.168
Tell me. Let me…

01:03:30.099 --> 01:03:31.499
Let me…

01:03:35.614 --> 01:03:37.014
Let me write…

01:04:04.089 --> 01:04:08.282
Really? Really hon? You're the one
that's always said it can't get personal?

01:04:08.297 --> 01:04:11.946
That's a whole other thing.
What are you doing opening my mail?

01:04:11.984 --> 01:04:14.266
That was scented, I assumed
it was just junk mail.

01:04:14.298 --> 01:04:17.200
Even less reasons to open it.
Where is it? Give it to me.

01:04:17.271 --> 01:04:18.575
You're not getting it.

01:04:18.857 --> 01:04:20.409
This is none of your business.

01:04:20.451 --> 01:04:22.229
You're still not getting it.
I threw it out.

01:04:23.808 --> 01:04:26.118
— You didn't.
— I fucking did!

01:04:27.735 --> 01:04:28.935
What's up?

01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:47.101
Would you ask your mother
to pass the salt, please?

01:04:49.985 --> 01:04:52.264
Cheryl, would you please pass the salt?

01:05:04.335 --> 01:05:07.145
Listen, I'm… I'm sorry.

01:05:07.369 --> 01:05:09.169
I know, I—I really upset you before.

01:05:09.216 --> 01:05:11.026
No no no, you didn’t.

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:12.992
I’m fine.

01:05:13.115 --> 01:05:14.691
— You sure?
— Yes.

01:05:18.892 --> 01:05:20.460
I promise.
— Really?

01:05:20.499 --> 01:05:22.899
Yes, in fact, I’ve come
around to your point of view.

01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:24.754
You were right.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.320
You’re usually right about these things.

01:05:38.432 --> 01:05:41.741
It was… quite a nice poem, really.

01:05:42.443 --> 01:05:46.573
Nothing astounding,
but it's heartfelt, and then…

01:05:46.936 --> 01:05:48.736
and then…

01:05:49.626 --> 01:05:51.186
Everything is great.

01:05:51.824 --> 01:05:54.215
I just need to get to sleep.

01:05:57.344 --> 01:05:58.351
Okay.

01:06:01.156 --> 01:06:02.356
Good night.

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:52.057
Let me touch you with my words.

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:55.650
For my hands lie limp as empty gloves.

01:07:15.616 --> 01:07:17.082
Amanda?

01:07:26.488 --> 01:07:27.782
I haven't seen you in a while.

01:07:27.830 --> 01:07:29.009
I know.

01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:30.990
I'm sorry.

01:07:33.389 --> 01:07:34.509
I'm, uhm…

01:07:35.263 --> 01:07:36.823
Well, I'm going to Germany.

01:07:37.768 --> 01:07:40.168
So I wanted to say goodbye
to you before I left.

01:07:41.325 --> 01:07:43.125
Why are you going to Germany?

01:07:43.711 --> 01:07:45.075
To study German.

01:07:45.164 --> 01:07:46.364
For how long?

01:07:46.506 --> 01:07:50.638
Hum… One or two years maybe.

01:07:52.183 --> 01:07:55.188
But… we should keep in touch.

01:07:56.147 --> 01:07:57.707
But why go to Germany?

01:07:58.501 --> 01:08:01.092
It's the only place in the world
where humor is forbidden.

01:08:06.072 --> 01:08:07.192
What?

01:08:09.395 --> 01:08:11.358
You could always make me laugh.

01:08:17.044 --> 01:08:19.465
I love you, Mark.

01:08:24.205 --> 01:08:26.426
— I really do.
— Really?

01:08:26.756 --> 01:08:29.157
Yes, I love you, but not in that way.

01:08:30.062 --> 01:08:32.462
I love you, but I'm not in love with you.

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:34.210
Blah, blah, blah.

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.060
The same old story.

01:08:36.935 --> 01:08:38.615
I'm sorry.

01:08:57.127 --> 01:09:00.296
I think it's great what you're
doing with this surrogate lady.

01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:02.194
Well, it could have been you.

01:09:04.975 --> 01:09:08.988
Yeah, it could have been, but… it wasn't.

01:09:12.490 --> 01:09:17.956
I had this faint hope that she would
show the slightest hint of jealousy.

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.067
It shows you how naive I am.

01:09:22.294 --> 01:09:27.448
The fact that I was no longer a virgin,
that I was a ‘made man', so to speak,

01:09:27.957 --> 01:09:30.055
made no difference to her at all.

01:09:34.738 --> 01:09:36.538
You want to go out some time?

01:09:38.478 --> 01:09:40.037
No, I don't think so.

01:09:40.368 --> 01:09:41.929
What, your boyfriend?

01:09:42.203 --> 01:09:44.233
No, I'm busy, that's all.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:50.839
What's wrong with this, anyway?
We're having a nice time, aren't we?

01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:53.010
It's okay.

01:09:55.071 --> 01:09:58.069
Well if you have things to do,
I can go to do a walk,

01:09:58.088 --> 01:09:59.522
if you're busy and come back later.

01:09:59.554 --> 01:10:01.983
No no, stay.
Stay.

01:10:05.185 --> 01:10:06.620
So come on, tell me.

01:10:07.745 --> 01:10:09.932
What kind of a therapist is she, really?

01:10:09.964 --> 01:10:12.766
I told you the first time,
she's a sex therapist.

01:10:15.324 --> 01:10:18.258
Today they're working
on simultaneous orgasm.

01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:22.540
What's that?

01:10:28.208 --> 01:10:30.348
Boy, am I glad to see you.

01:10:30.374 --> 01:10:32.496
Don't you say that to all the girls?

01:10:32.614 --> 01:10:34.414
Yes, but I always mean it.

01:10:56.429 --> 01:10:58.229
Remember about your breathing.

01:11:00.627 --> 01:11:03.257
Concentrate on breathing
out rather than in.

01:11:05.913 --> 01:11:10.551
Mark was able to achieve an erection
as soon as I put my mouth upon him.

01:11:11.342 --> 01:11:13.753
He did the controlled breathing,
as I had suggested,

01:11:13.794 --> 01:11:17.369
and I was able to get on top
and guide him in quite easily.

01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:23.376
Is it in? Is it really in?

01:11:23.431 --> 01:11:24.991
Yes, it's really in.

01:11:27.307 --> 01:11:28.867
I couldn't believe it.

01:11:29.679 --> 01:11:31.239
I was finally there.

01:11:34.795 --> 01:11:36.355
Too soon, I came.

01:11:37.112 --> 01:11:39.512
But she kept holding me inside her.

01:11:42.528 --> 01:11:46.206
Then a look of pleasure brushed
lightly over her face…

01:11:47.363 --> 01:11:50.572
as though an all-day itch
were finally being scratched.

01:11:58.075 --> 01:12:01.964
She put her hands down on the bed by
my shoulders and kissed my chest.

01:12:07.331 --> 01:12:09.731
This act of affection moved me deeply.

01:12:15.091 --> 01:12:16.732
I almost wept.

01:12:18.721 --> 01:12:21.121
No one had ever done anything like that.

01:12:27.995 --> 01:12:29.915
It was so unexpected…

01:12:31.117 --> 01:12:32.281
and natural.

01:12:41.708 --> 01:12:43.377
I love you.

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:47.121
I love you, too.

01:12:48.892 --> 01:12:50.092
Did you come, yeah?

01:12:51.091 --> 01:12:52.051
Yes.

01:12:53.616 --> 01:12:56.616
Mark is breathing well and
learning to pace himself.

01:12:57.108 --> 01:13:00.723
There is no real physical impediment
to a variety of sexual activities,

01:13:00.779 --> 01:13:02.878
given the right sort of partner.

01:13:04.376 --> 01:13:08.991
His deeper emotional needs are outside
the scope of my potential involvement.

01:13:18.041 --> 01:13:19.601
What happens when…

01:13:22.115 --> 01:13:23.675
What happens when what?

01:13:25.549 --> 01:13:27.949
When people become attached to each other.

01:13:29.089 --> 01:13:31.329
— What people?
— Just people.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.160
What's the chemistry of it all?

01:13:35.465 --> 01:13:37.611
When people are attracted to each other.

01:13:37.642 --> 01:13:38.960
Are you attracted to me?

01:13:38.995 --> 01:13:40.395
God, no.

01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:42.810
We're just talking hypothetically.

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:44.967
Hypothetically…

01:13:45.896 --> 01:13:47.925
they write poems…

01:13:48.871 --> 01:13:50.224
they have sex.

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:54.614
And what happens next?

01:13:55.317 --> 01:13:57.552
After poetry and sex?

01:13:59.337 --> 01:14:00.936
Nothing or everything.

01:14:01.429 --> 01:14:03.998
The rest is by negotiation, as it were.

01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:05.590
What do you mean?

01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:09.629
I mean, you can leave it
at love and attraction,

01:14:11.316 --> 01:14:14.668
or you can make things complicated,
like most people do.

01:14:17.721 --> 01:14:18.921
Have you?

01:14:21.951 --> 01:14:23.151
Yes.

01:14:24.818 --> 01:14:26.729
Then afterwards…

01:14:28.409 --> 01:14:32.206
there was this… moment.

01:14:34.882 --> 01:14:38.256
Τhіѕ glіmрѕе оf thе аwful ѕаdnеѕѕ tо соmе.

01:14:44.561 --> 01:14:46.199
Can I use the phone?

01:14:46.319 --> 01:14:47.279
Sure.

01:14:47.371 --> 01:14:48.491
Would you call their room.

01:15:01.552 --> 01:15:04.130
What shall we do next time?
Any requests?

01:15:07.127 --> 01:15:08.087
Mark?

01:15:08.375 --> 01:15:09.575
I'm thinking.

01:15:12.805 --> 01:15:15.426
We have two sessions
left, is that correct?

01:15:16.602 --> 01:15:17.802
That's right, or…

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.720
Or, what?

01:15:20.774 --> 01:15:22.334
Or, we could stop now.

01:15:25.059 --> 01:15:27.867
— You mean, make this the last session?
— Yes.

01:15:34.969 --> 01:15:36.383
What do you think we should do?

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.781
It's not we, it's you, Mark.
It's up to you.

01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:40.980
I want to know how you feel.

01:15:41.416 --> 01:15:43.865
— That doesn't come in to it.
— Yes, it does.

01:15:44.663 --> 01:15:47.063
I don't just write poems to anyone.

01:15:49.124 --> 01:15:50.924
Mark, what do you want me to say?

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:53.817
How much I was touched by that?

01:15:54.224 --> 01:15:57.456
How special this has been to me?

01:15:59.375 --> 01:16:02.169
It's not gonna help you,
it's gonna make it worse.

01:16:03.090 --> 01:16:09.158
So you're saying that…
the sixth session, that will be it?

01:16:09.228 --> 01:16:10.788
That will be it.

01:16:13.585 --> 01:16:17.871
If it's any consolation, it’s also
hard for me to think about it.

01:16:21.466 --> 01:16:23.420
Then maybe we should pull the plug now.

01:16:23.475 --> 01:16:24.732
I think we should.

01:16:28.585 --> 01:16:32.075
I guess you might as well save that money.
Buy yourself a futon.

01:16:40.331 --> 01:16:41.531
Just a second!

01:16:51.757 --> 01:16:52.957
Bye, Mark.

01:16:55.245 --> 01:16:56.205
Bye.

01:17:06.049 --> 01:17:07.088
Is everything all right?

01:17:07.133 --> 01:17:09.845
He did great. See you. I'm
sorry, I have to run.

01:17:45.055 --> 01:17:46.615
You forgot this.

01:18:49.569 --> 01:18:52.527
I wanted to believe that because
of Cheryl, my life had changed.

01:18:52.542 --> 01:18:53.996
But it hadn't.

01:18:56.311 --> 01:18:58.371
I just kept thinking, is that it?

01:19:00.774 --> 01:19:03.174
Is that all there is?

01:19:05.763 --> 01:19:07.563
I think you’ve done a great thing.

01:19:19.989 --> 01:19:22.068
So, is this your first time?

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:25.205
— It is, I'm converting.
— Oh, wonderful.

01:19:25.651 --> 01:19:30.336
Come here, I need to look at your hands,
your fingernails, and your toe nails.

01:19:30.996 --> 01:19:32.556
So, what do you do?

01:19:33.968 --> 01:19:36.479
— I don't think you'd understand.
— You can try me.

01:19:37.191 --> 01:19:38.151
Okay.

01:19:38.978 --> 01:19:40.362
I'm a housewife.

01:19:40.762 --> 01:19:43.561
— Why shouldn't I understand?
— Maybe I was mistaken.

01:19:43.827 --> 01:19:44.637
Turn around.

01:19:44.848 --> 01:19:49.673
And drop your robe halfway, I'm gonna
check for any loose hairs on your back.

01:19:50.065 --> 01:19:53.969
That looks good, I'll take the robe
and you can let your hair down now.

01:19:55.277 --> 01:19:57.337
I see you're very comfortable being naked.

01:19:57.410 --> 01:19:59.313
Never been one of my problems.

01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:03.839
Sometimes new brides
come with their mothers.

01:20:04.196 --> 01:20:07.743
Do I have to take this off?
Can I please leave this on?

01:20:07.891 --> 01:20:09.691
They've never been naked before.

01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:12.424
No honey, it all has to come off.

01:20:12.488 --> 01:20:14.721
— And it does?
— And it does.

01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:20.234
They stand on the edge of that pool
with nothing to cling to but themselves.

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:22.420
Nothing to hide behind.

01:20:23.341 --> 01:20:24.901
This is your body.

01:20:25.628 --> 01:20:28.841
This is the body that God crafted for you.

01:20:32.517 --> 01:20:35.048
Okay Mark, you can open your eyes now.

01:20:41.006 --> 01:20:42.566
This is your body.

01:20:50.347 --> 01:20:51.965
This is your body.

01:21:18.827 --> 01:21:20.927
Well, I can do it tomorrow.

01:22:01.472 --> 01:22:05.501
The person you are calling is not in.
Please lave a message.

01:22:06.978 --> 01:22:09.983
Rod. I need your help.

01:22:10.357 --> 01:22:14.143
The power's gone out, including
the pump on the iron lung.

01:22:14.283 --> 01:22:17.944
I'd say I've got about three hours
before I start to turn blue.

01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:23.612
I hope you get this in time.
It's Mark. I'll try 911.

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:35.702
Shit.

01:22:49.419 --> 01:22:51.219
So this is how it ends.

01:23:11.136 --> 01:23:14.219
Mark. Can you hear me, Mark?

01:23:14.789 --> 01:23:16.349
Can you hear me?

01:23:18.115 --> 01:23:20.489
Mark. Come on now.

01:23:25.819 --> 01:23:27.619
They'll be letting you go today.

01:23:28.304 --> 01:23:31.666
Whoever looks after you will leave the
portable respirator switched on at night,

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:34.435
fully charged, so you'll have
at least one back-up system.

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.000
Okay?
— Okay.

01:23:37.364 --> 01:23:38.924
How close was I?

01:23:40.525 --> 01:23:41.725
To what?

01:23:43.154 --> 01:23:46.433
You know, the—
that tunnel thing and the…

01:23:47.239 --> 01:23:52.228
light, and the voice saying
'don't go near the light'.

01:23:54.615 --> 01:23:55.957
Is that what you remember?

01:23:56.027 --> 01:23:57.857
No, I assume I passed out.

01:23:59.297 --> 01:24:02.185
But before that, I remember
feeling sorry for myself.

01:24:03.923 --> 01:24:06.431
— Do you feel relieved now?
— No.

01:24:07.171 --> 01:24:10.200
Relieved that Rod got
to me in time, but I…

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.715
still feel sorry for myself.

01:24:14.683 --> 01:24:17.050
Well, I'm sure there's
a cure for that, huh?

01:24:17.507 --> 01:24:19.307
Do you wanna talk to someone, or…?

01:24:20.064 --> 01:24:22.301
I feel comfortable talking to you.

01:24:23.802 --> 01:24:27.640
Well, I'm… just a volunteer,
not a therapist.

01:24:29.091 --> 01:24:31.491
I can recommend you
to someone if you want.

01:24:31.718 --> 01:24:34.731
I'm—I'm sorry to be rude, I'm just

01:24:34.806 --> 01:24:39.506
smiling at the idea that a therapist
could do anything useful for me right now.

01:24:39.624 --> 01:24:41.184
My priest couldn't.

01:24:41.444 --> 01:24:43.004
Are you religious?

01:24:43.362 --> 01:24:46.742
Yes, I would find it
absolutely intolerable

01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:50.154
not to be able to blame
someone for all this.

01:24:55.201 --> 01:24:57.122
Are you?
— No.

01:24:57.908 --> 01:25:03.257
I don't go to any church and I
don't think about God very much.

01:25:03.665 --> 01:25:09.405
I do believe there's a…
mysterious logic, or…

01:25:10.499 --> 01:25:12.762
poetry to life.

01:25:13.494 --> 01:25:16.426
— I guess that makes me a spiritual type.
— Oh yes.

01:25:17.566 --> 01:25:19.126
That would count.

01:25:23.611 --> 01:25:25.411
Would you like me to visit you?

01:25:25.448 --> 01:25:27.858
— Are you married?
— No.

01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:29.980
Do you have a steady boyfriend?

01:25:31.344 --> 01:25:32.304
No.

01:25:32.334 --> 01:25:34.734
Then please visit as often as you can.

01:25:36.147 --> 01:25:37.699
— Bye.
— Bye.

01:25:37.755 --> 01:25:40.495
— Take care.
— Hey, hang on a second.

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:42.990
What?

01:25:43.657 --> 01:25:46.057
There's just one more
thing I want to tell you.

01:25:46.198 --> 01:25:47.598
What's that?

01:25:50.387 --> 01:25:51.947
I'm not a virgin.

01:25:54.730 --> 01:25:56.277
Go ahead.

01:26:01.301 --> 01:26:03.439
Thank you for sharing that with me.

01:26:10.215 --> 01:26:11.775
I'm flabbergasted.

01:26:11.956 --> 01:26:15.008
She adores me. She'll do
anything for me, and

01:26:15.102 --> 01:26:18.031
And I can get pretty kinky sometimes.

01:26:18.176 --> 01:26:21.048
Here I was, ready to offer
comfort to the forlorn.

01:26:21.214 --> 01:26:23.236
That's supposed to be my specialty.

01:26:23.475 --> 01:26:26.402
Now I guess I'll throw
away that little speech.

01:26:26.624 --> 01:26:30.488
No, no. Please make the little speech.

01:26:31.515 --> 01:26:33.075
I'd love to hear it.

01:26:33.184 --> 01:26:34.919
Okay, fine. Here goes.

01:26:35.169 --> 01:26:36.729
The meaning of love.

01:26:37.943 --> 01:26:39.503
Love is a journey.

01:26:39.723 --> 01:26:41.283
I like it already.

01:26:45.315 --> 01:26:48.148
That's it, that’s all of I’ve got.
I told you it’s short.

01:26:48.355 --> 01:26:50.187
Love is a journey.

01:27:08.518 --> 01:27:11.523
I met Susan five years before I died.

01:27:12.425 --> 01:27:15.148
She was the love of my life.

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:20.813
We had the same priorities,
baseball pretty much came first,

01:27:21.253 --> 01:27:24.086
and we wrote each other mushy poems.

01:27:24.828 --> 01:27:30.818
I never expected it, nor did she, but
that's often the way things turn out.

01:27:36.806 --> 01:27:38.906
They say there is a cup of life.

01:27:39.741 --> 01:27:42.254
But you see, they're
half empty or half full.

01:27:42.637 --> 01:27:45.043
depending on how you feel about things.

01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:48.764
Of course, the two halves were never even.

01:27:49.109 --> 01:27:51.436
Not in my case, that's for sure.

01:27:52.202 --> 01:27:56.152
Look at all the years I've had a
durable crap I've had to put up with.

01:27:56.489 --> 01:27:58.463
That fills most of the cup.

01:27:59.956 --> 01:28:05.227
But in the little bit that's left,
what do I have to show for myself?

01:28:06.665 --> 01:28:12.529
At the very least, three beautiful
women who all loved me,

01:28:13.677 --> 01:28:16.299
and who will all show up at my funeral.

01:28:16.729 --> 01:28:21.695
His was a dynamic voice
in a paralyzed body.

01:28:22.852 --> 01:28:27.623
A life lived fully long after
he should have been dead.

01:28:27.974 --> 01:28:33.159
And against all odds by Mark's
own admission, he knew love,

01:28:34.011 --> 01:28:36.501
emotional and physical love.

01:28:38.001 --> 01:28:42.608
And in this way, Mark lived his life,
day by day by day,

01:28:43.369 --> 01:28:49.497
breath by breath
by breath, for 49 years.

01:28:49.903 --> 01:28:53.403
He loved, and he was loved.

01:28:58.184 --> 01:29:02.010
And now, Susan Fernbach will read
one of Mark's favorite poems.

01:29:09.515 --> 01:29:11.559
This is called…

01:29:12.718 --> 01:29:15.114
Love Poem for No One in Particular.

01:29:19.615 --> 01:29:22.275
Let me touch you with my words.

01:29:23.516 --> 01:29:26.784
For my hands lie limp as empty gloves.

01:29:27.814 --> 01:29:30.460
Let my words stroke your hair,

01:29:30.739 --> 01:29:34.514
slide down your back
and tickle your belly.

01:29:35.755 --> 01:29:40.815
For my hands, light and
free-flying as bricks,

01:29:40.995 --> 01:29:46.867
ignore my wishes and stubbornly refuse
to carry out my quietest desires.

01:29:48.124 --> 01:29:51.426
Let my words enter your mind,

01:29:52.508 --> 01:29:54.403
bearing torches.

01:29:55.091 --> 01:29:57.815
Admit them willingly into your being,

01:29:58.287 --> 01:30:00.995
So they may caress you gently…

01:30:01.238 --> 01:30:03.058
within.
— .. within.
