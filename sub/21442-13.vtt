00:07.674 --> 00:09.743
- What's up, guys? Welcome to
"The Dude Perfect Show."

00:09.809 --> 00:12.579
You know, all of us grew up
playing Little League baseball.

00:12.645 --> 00:14.080
And if you play enough games,

00:14.147 --> 00:15.815
you're bound to hit a homerun
at some point.

00:15.882 --> 00:17.083
Gar, did you ever
have a homerun?

00:17.150 --> 00:18.885
- I had multiple, Ty.
- I did, too.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.787
- You know who didn't
have a homerun ever?

00:20.854 --> 00:21.788
- We're going there, huh?

00:21.855 --> 00:23.089
- Yeah, we are,
we're going there.

00:23.156 --> 00:25.825
You guys have never hit one
out of the park?

00:25.892 --> 00:27.560
- We've never hit one
out of the park.

00:27.627 --> 00:28.695
- Anyways, we've got our annual

00:28.762 --> 00:30.196
Dude Perfect Homerun Derby
coming up.

00:30.263 --> 00:31.765
And we don't want these guys
to embarrass themselves.

00:31.831 --> 00:34.000
So, we decided, let's get 'em
some training so we've got

00:34.067 --> 00:36.102
an even playing field
before we get started.

00:36.169 --> 00:37.904
You guys ready to do it?

03:18.998 --> 03:20.667
Glad to have you out here.
Here's the deal.

03:20.733 --> 03:23.303
Growing up on a ranch, you learn
so many things about baseball

03:23.369 --> 03:24.671
that you don't even know
you're learning.

03:24.737 --> 03:25.805

But more than that,
haybales were my coach.

03:33.446 --> 03:35.248
Cinderblocks were my coach.

03:35.315 --> 03:36.416
- I won't tell your dad.

- Tractor tires
were my coach, okay?

go into to help shape

the baseball player
that I am today.

03:43.923 --> 03:45.024
Let's start at the base.

03:45.091 --> 03:46.826
A baseball swing's
all about the foundation.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.161
Cory, I need you over here.

03:48.227 --> 03:50.029
Coby, you stay on that side.
- Okay.

03:50.096 --> 03:51.731
- We're just gonna do
a little exercise.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.866
- That looks heavy.
- Heads ups, Cobs. Timber.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.268
- Yep.

back over to Cory.

See what you did there?
- Ahhhhh!

04:06.779 --> 04:08.014
- No, that wasn't good.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.616

- Okay, it gets
a little hectic in there.

15:56.355 --> 15:59.658
- And their head is so big
that they just flop their head.

15:59.725 --> 16:00.893
- Why is their head so big?

16:00.959 --> 16:02.428
- I don't know.

16:02.494 --> 16:04.296
- Alright, so, Quindlen, when
your little brother or sister's

16:04.363 --> 16:07.232
crying, how do you help
keep 'em from crying?

16:07.299 --> 16:10.602
- You just need
to try something,

16:10.669 --> 16:13.138
and then it probably work
or not.

16:13.205 --> 16:15.107
- Sometimes they're crying
either just because

16:15.174 --> 16:16.542
they're tired
and there's too much,

16:16.608 --> 16:19.678
or they just want to be
the center of attention.

16:19.745 --> 16:22.047
- Okay, well that's
a--that's a lot of good info.

16:22.114 --> 16:25.217
So, who would you say should
change the most diapers?

16:25.284 --> 16:27.619
- I know.
- Oh, okay, Quindlen.

16:27.686 --> 16:28.887
- The mom.

16:28.954 --> 16:31.423

with you on that one.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.993
Okay, what if it's like a
super, super stinky one?

16:35.060 --> 16:36.628
- The dad.
- The dad.

16:36.695 --> 16:38.931

then I have to take over?

16:38.997 --> 16:40.165
- KIDS: Yeah.

16:40.232 --> 16:42.034
- And what if it's just
a regular wet one,

16:42.101 --> 16:43.369
then Mom does it?
- KIDS: Yeah.

16:43.435 --> 16:45.504

than Garrett and Cody,

16:45.571 --> 16:46.638
I gotta say.

16:46.705 --> 16:48.640
So, you guys each have a toy
in front of you.

16:48.707 --> 16:51.710
How would you entertain a baby
with the toy that you have?

16:51.777 --> 16:54.046
- You look at this one,
it would just look like that.

16:54.113 --> 16:55.547
And you can make
noises like that.

16:55.614 --> 16:56.682
- That's good.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.417
- And then they could
eat this right here.

16:58.484 --> 16:59.385
- They can eat that?

16:59.451 --> 17:00.719
- Yeah, they could
just chew on it.

17:00.786 --> 17:03.222

but you can teeth it.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.092
