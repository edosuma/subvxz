(GROANS)

00:04.338 --> 00:05.327
(SIGHS)

00:05.464 --> 00:08.001
Say hello
to your daughter.

00:10.427 --> 00:11.792
Hey, baby.

00:13.305 --> 00:16.672
So what do you think, Tess?
You think you can handle
this place on your own?

00:16.808 --> 00:17.797
Me?

00:24.650 --> 00:27.392
Okay, oh, don't forget
the quarterly reviews
are due this Thursday.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.894
So I'll make sure
Fargo has the proper
documentation.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.942
With Henry away at NASA,
you will be in charge
of the senior staff meeting.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.565
And watch out for Berg,

00:34.701 --> 00:36.202
because if she
starts talking about
her weekend...

00:36.328 --> 00:38.364
We'll be ordering
dinner in, I got it.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.078
(CHUCKLES) Okay, good. Good.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.913
Oh, don't forget,
make sure that...

00:42.042 --> 00:43.498
Al, would you trust me?

00:43.627 --> 00:45.709
I mean, look, I know this
is kind of my first day
and everything,

00:45.837 --> 00:48.249
but I'm thinking
I got everything
under control.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.963
Yeah, okay. I'm sorry,

00:50.092 --> 00:51.923
(LAUGHING) ljust...

00:52.970 --> 00:56.133
I really appreciate you
filling in for me at G.D.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.051
G.D.'s going to be fine.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.923
Now would you go
be a mom already?

01:00.060 --> 01:02.426
All right,
I can take a hint.

01:02.938 --> 01:03.893
Bye.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.011
(SIGHS)

01:07.568 --> 01:08.683
Hey.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.851
Thought you finished
your homework last night.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.900
Yeah, I did.
I'm doing college research.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.732
But you're a junior.

01:16.868 --> 01:19.780
Yeah, which puts me,
like, five years behind
the other kids at Tesla.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.494
I mean, they all took
the SCAT in grade school.

01:21.623 --> 01:22.829
The SCAT?

01:22.958 --> 01:24.744
The Student Career
Assessment Test.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.492
It's supposed to point us
in the right direction,

01:27.629 --> 01:29.460
and I didn't take it
until last week.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.000
So what did it say?

01:31.133 --> 01:32.998
I haven't gotten
the results yet.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.671
But I mean,
after helping Allison
with the baby,

01:34.803 --> 01:37.510
like, I know I just
want to be a doctor.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.847
Yeah. You did
really like that.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.970
Yeah, I loved it.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.887
(SIGHS) I hate
the thought of you leaving.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.351
SARAH: I'll always be here,
Sheriff Carter.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.349
Yes! Not the same.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.818
Speaking of being alone,

01:54.948 --> 01:56.324
how are
you and Tess doing?

01:56.950 --> 01:57.939
Good.

01:58.910 --> 01:59.740
Really good.

01:59.870 --> 02:03.863
You know, if
she ever wants to,
like, stay over...

02:03.999 --> 02:06.786
Whoa! Not having
this conversation
with my daughter.

02:06.918 --> 02:10.046
Dad, I'm just saying,
life is short.

02:11.423 --> 02:12.663
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

02:13.925 --> 02:15.426
Thank God.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.334
Carter.

02:27.773 --> 02:28.979
Need a hand?

02:29.107 --> 02:31.814
It's not really
a two-person job,

02:31.943 --> 02:33.069
and you hate
this kind of work.

02:33.195 --> 02:36.062
Well, not today.
Zane's coming home.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.564
Oh. He's been gone
a while.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.110
A month.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.950
Wow! This is
getting serious.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.912
Yeah. It's been
a while.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.748
I mean,
there was Callister,
and while he was a...

02:48.877 --> 02:50.378
A robot.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.166
And then there was
Taggart and,
well, he's...

02:53.298 --> 02:54.378
Taggan.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.668
Yeah.

02:57.052 --> 03:01.011
I mean, I'm not
used to the normal
relationship thing.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.511
So what about you and Tess?

03:05.644 --> 03:09.102
Have you guys
exchanged keys yet?

03:09.231 --> 03:11.472
Uh, no.
No, I mean, we're...

03:12.734 --> 03:14.474
Why is everybody
asking me that today?

03:14.611 --> 03:15.851
(LAUGHS)

03:16.822 --> 03:19.780
So, what are we doing
on the mountain
service road?

03:19.908 --> 03:22.820
I made it a straight shot
for some transport
headed to G.D.

03:22.953 --> 03:23.908
Hmm.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.029
Traffic duty
with no traffic.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.154
Hmm.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.783
Feels kind of
silly. Yeah.

03:30.919 --> 03:34.787
(HORN BLARING)

03:46.852 --> 03:48.638
JO: Maybe not so silly.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.987
That's a really big truck.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.076
Hey.

04:10.459 --> 04:11.539
Why the face?

04:11.668 --> 04:13.954
Oh, I'm just
confronting my future.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.756
You got your
test results? Cool!

04:16.882 --> 04:17.746
What did they say?

04:17.883 --> 04:19.623
I'm too afraid
to open the email.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.672
Why? The SCAT is,
like, 99.8% accurate.

04:22.804 --> 04:23.793
Yeah, that's the point.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.921
I mean, this could tell me
what kind of medicine
l'm cut out for.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.433
You know, I was
thinking OB/GYN,

04:27.559 --> 04:28.890
but pediatrics
could be cool.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.510
Well, this will
help you decide.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.228
Okay, I can't click it.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.346
(BEEPS)

04:37.861 --> 04:38.976
What?

04:39.571 --> 04:41.061
Robotics engineering?

04:42.199 --> 04:44.190
Look at those
data points.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.658
It's a perfect
aptitude match
for you.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.776
Very cool.

04:47.913 --> 04:48.743
No. No, that's not cool.

04:48.872 --> 04:52.660
That's totally not
what I want to do.
It's just a stupid test.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.329
(BELL DINGS)
VINCENT: Order up.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.891

Um, you okay?

05:20.946 --> 05:22.311
I'm fine.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.860
Okay, let's try this again.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.156
I've got a lot
of work to do.

05:37.879 --> 05:38.868
(CHUCKLES)

05:41.174 --> 05:42.550
CARTER: Things
seem pretty quiet.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.756
Why are you calling me
down here exactly?

05:43.885 --> 05:45.045
Things are pretty quiet.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.134
I need you to
keep them that way.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.720
I need your help
with some security.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.055
Okay. Security
for what?

05:50.183 --> 05:52.674
We got a very special
delivery today.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.227
CARTER: What exactly
is this delivery?

06:00.360 --> 06:03.397
TESS: About
750,000 years.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.316
FARGO: Give or take
a few millennia.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.491
Pretty impressive,
huh?

06:14.499 --> 06:18.037
You need security
for a giant icicle?

06:18.169 --> 06:22.959
It's an ice core,
the longest one
ever recovered.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.919
A CD. team just drilled it
out of the Arctic sheet.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.840
You see, snow has been
falling in the Arctic
for millennia.

06:29.973 --> 06:33.465
And this core
is a record of each year,
layer by layer by layer,

06:33.602 --> 06:36.639
stretching all the way
back into time.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.479
And that's
valuable, why?

06:40.066 --> 06:43.183
Well, snow traps things
as it freezes.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.608
Uh, spores,
bits of volcanic ash.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.277
So we can actually see
what the atmosphere
looked like

06:49.409 --> 06:51.650
thousands and thousands
of years ago.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.947
Kind of cool when
you think about it.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.787
Not the temperature kind,
but the...

06:58.293 --> 06:59.533
I should go
do something.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.920
(CHUCKLES)
Bye, Fargo.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.705
Okay, look.
You see each
of these bands?

07:04.841 --> 07:07.253
Each one of them
represents up to
10,000 years.

07:07.385 --> 07:08.670
Yeah, like tree rings.

07:08.803 --> 07:14.764
Exactly. And all of human
history takes up about
this much of the core.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.810
Kind of makes you
feel insignificant,
doesn't it?

07:18.939 --> 07:22.181
Like we just don't
have as much time
as we think we do.

07:22.317 --> 07:26.185
So, uh, we should
probably make the most
of it, then, huh?

07:26.988 --> 07:28.273
I'd say so.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.983
Maybe dinner at my place,
just you and me?

07:33.119 --> 07:35.656
Yeah, that sounds...
Oh, no. I can't.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.404
This is my first day
covering for Allison.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.247
l have so much to do.
But soon, okay?

07:40.377 --> 07:41.617
Sure, sure.

07:42.837 --> 07:47.251
So this is the first time
we've had an intact core
to study in the lab.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.625
Zane developed
a nano-particle
refrigeration system

07:49.761 --> 07:51.752
just to get this thing
down here.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.799
That guy is
the king of cold.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.263
Tell me about it.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.428
Uh, so, security?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.687
Um, yeah, the team leader
will fill you in
on what he needs.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.644
He should be here
any minute.

back together!

I'm assuming you all
know each other.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.695
Yeah. Eureka was
my home for a spell.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.031
I did some fine
zoological work
in these parts.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.276
And it hasn't been
the same without you.

08:57.412 --> 08:58.822

08:59.581 --> 09:01.993
Ambled from
Melbourne to Minsk.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.331
l was doing
a polar bear count

09:03.460 --> 09:05.451
when I heard about
the ice core project.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.329
Couldn't turn down a chance
to study primordial life,
now, could I?

09:08.465 --> 09:12.083
Well, you never know
where a walkabout
is going to lead you.

you end up right back
where you started.

All of G.D. is insulated
with it, along with
every building in town.

is an incredibly
expensive process.

verify this list for
security information.

11:17.552 --> 11:20.840
Wow, this is going
to take a while.

11:20.972 --> 11:24.339
It is required
before we turn over
this ice to you.

11:24.475 --> 11:27.967
No checklist, uh,
no John Woodcock.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.766
Months with
no daylight at all.

11:33.902 --> 11:39.647
The only sound,
the keening wind
as it scours the ice,

11:39.782 --> 11:41.113
(HARSHLY) looking
to punish a man

11:41.242 --> 11:42.527
(ALL GASPING)

11:42.660 --> 11:44.275
(WHISPERING)
for the least mistake.

11:45.955 --> 11:49.698
They say the north
changes you.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.204
Keeps a part of your soul.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.162
The man who returns,

11:57.175 --> 12:00.667
is not the man who left.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.761
Excuse me, mate.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.978
Here you go, kid.
I'll be back in a jiff.

12:19.113 --> 12:23.903
(SIGHS) We haven't hardly
had a chance to talk.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.947
But even when we did,
we, uh...

12:27.288 --> 12:28.277
We didn't.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.616
You left town without
even saying goodbye.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.374
Two years ago.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.829
I didn't think you wanted
a goodbye from me.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.457
You and Zane were
already well on your way

12:40.593 --> 12:42.754
to becoming
a happy little couple.

12:43.972 --> 12:47.055
I guess we...
We were. Yeah.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.809
He's an odd fellow,
if you don't mind
me saying.

12:52.897 --> 12:53.886
Mmm...

12:54.023 --> 12:55.479
Moody type.

12:56.818 --> 13:00.777
Chatty at first,
but after a while,
he turned downright

13:02.156 --> 13:03.657
icy.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.786
My audience awaits.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.082
It is good to
see you again, Jo.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.502
TAGGART: Fargo? Hat.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.843
(SIGHS) Now,
where were we?

13:30.893 --> 13:32.349
Ah, yes.
(CLEARS THROAT)

13:35.023 --> 13:38.811
What you just saw,
you know,
between Taggart and me,

13:39.819 --> 13:42.481
that wasn't romantic
or anything.

13:44.907 --> 13:45.862
Zane.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.903
(CHUCKLES) Well,
you know that, right?

13:50.997 --> 13:52.453
Don't worry about it.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.415
(EXHALES)

14:04.552 --> 14:06.964
Somebody looks tense.
What's the matter?

14:07.096 --> 14:09.303
Well, Captain Yuri
has me going

14:09.432 --> 14:12.139
through Eureka's
entire library of
disaster plans.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.135
I mean, tsunami,
uh, missile attack.

14:15.271 --> 14:20.015
Um, genetically modified
super-intelligent
ferret infestation.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.693
Cool.
Yeah. And apparently

14:23.821 --> 14:27.905
we have an emergency
pneumatic vacuum tube
communication system.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.023
Hmm.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.911
No, we don't!

14:34.415 --> 14:36.792
And I mean,
these plans...

14:39.212 --> 14:40.201
Oh.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.955
Yeah, but...
I mean...

14:44.509 --> 14:46.750
Doesn't actually
work, right?

14:48.971 --> 14:49.881
Uh...

14:50.014 --> 14:51.754
(WHOOSHING)
Wait... Wait...
That... That's...

14:51.891 --> 14:53.506
(EXCLAIMS)

14:53.976 --> 14:54.931
Well, that'll be
really handy

14:55.061 --> 14:57.268
if we ever need
to send anyone
a baseball.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.310
You okay?

15:07.782 --> 15:09.363
(TREMULOUSLY)
Yeah, uh...

15:11.035 --> 15:14.323
Zane, uh,
he's just...

15:14.455 --> 15:16.286
He's being so cold.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.543
Think after
a couple of weeks
with Taggart, uh,

15:22.672 --> 15:25.163
anyone would need
a little alone time.

15:27.510 --> 15:28.795
Yeah.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.676
Just try to be patient.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.309
(INSTRUMENTS BEEPING)

15:53.828 --> 15:55.238
Captain Yuri!

15:55.371 --> 15:57.737
(CHUCKLES)
Oh! Sheriff.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.239
This is everything
you asked for.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.161
I reviewed disaster plans
for the last 15 years,

16:01.294 --> 16:03.910
and we're prepared
for every possibility.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.082
Could you maybe...
A hand...

16:06.215 --> 16:08.080
Yes. This is for you.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.332
(EXCLAIMS)

16:10.052 --> 16:13.385
Oh, this. This is
very excellent, Sheriff.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.632
Thank you. Great. So...
I don't mean to be rude...

16:16.767 --> 16:20.259
Oh, where is my manners?
Please, you must have pastry.

16:20.396 --> 16:23.684
Hmm? I was down
in your beautiful
commissary.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.104
There was such selection!
I overindulge.

16:29.780 --> 16:30.940
That is good.
Yeah?

16:31.073 --> 16:32.324
Yeah.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.700
With all due respect, sir,
there are a lot of people
who are really eager

16:35.828 --> 16:39.195
to get working on the core,
so if we could sign...

16:39.332 --> 16:41.197
Oh, of course.
There's just
one more thing.

16:41.334 --> 16:45.998
Our bureau of standards
requires precise measurement
of ice core itself.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.461
I'm sure
Taggart's come up

16:47.590 --> 16:50.798
with some sort of
super-accurate laser
measurement thing.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.463
No doubt, you know,

16:52.595 --> 16:56.304
but men like us,
we do not trust
this kind of technology.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.514
Sure.
We are...
How you say?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.384
Old school.

17:10.571 --> 17:11.856
Taggan?

17:20.414 --> 17:22.029
Taggan?

17:22.917 --> 17:25.750
There's way more
ice in here than
there was before!

17:29.215 --> 17:31.831
Now I know you're
out here somewhere.

17:40.268 --> 17:41.758
I need some help
in here!

17:50.236 --> 17:52.978
(SHIVERING) I've never
experienced anything
like it.

17:53.823 --> 17:57.361
One minute I was
standing there measuring
the density of the core,

17:58.244 --> 18:01.077
the next minute,
it was upon me.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.194
What was?

18:02.331 --> 18:03.446
The ice!

18:04.083 --> 18:07.325
Like some icy anaconda.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.750
Dr. Taggart, the thing is,
ice doesn't really attack.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.873
Well, maybe
it's a malfunction
in the cooling unit.

18:15.386 --> 18:17.297
Well, nano-particle
refrigeration

18:17.430 --> 18:19.261
is an incredibly
new technology.

18:19.390 --> 18:22.974
It could be interlopers
of a more mythical nature.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.809
Spirits of the north.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.897
Okay. Um,
I'm gonna call Zane
about those cooling units.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.349
Okay.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.601
I'm telling you,
Jack,

18:33.738 --> 18:36.821
there are strange things
under the midnight sun!

18:36.949 --> 18:40.191
Yes, and...
But before we go
looking for yetis,

18:40.328 --> 18:43.786
we're going to check out
the refrigeration machine
and the ice itself.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.290
Right.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.118
Right.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.789
The ice is everywhere.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.661
I mean, it's even
grown up the walls.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.255
That's weird.
Hmm.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.270
You ever seen ice
with black streaks
in it before?

19:12.693 --> 19:13.933
No.

19:14.278 --> 19:17.236
Then again, I've never paid
that much attention
to ice before.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.859
LUCAS: Zoe,
I got you a present.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.701

19:27.833 --> 19:31.200
A college-level
robotics kit.
Pretty neat!

19:32.380 --> 19:33.415
Right?

19:33.923 --> 19:37.507
No, um...
I already told you
I'm not interested in this.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.375
Have you ever even
tried robotics?

19:39.512 --> 19:40.672
No, I don't have to.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.386
I mean, I already know
what I want to do,

19:42.515 --> 19:44.972
regardless of what
that dumb test says.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.557
Yeah, this week you do.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.968
(CHUCKLES)
I'm just saying.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.561
I just don't want you
to miss out on something

19:50.690 --> 19:52.055
that you might
really love.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.235
Who else was in here
around the time
you found Taggart?

20:01.367 --> 20:03.403
As far as I know,
only Zane.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.027
He's the one that designed
this cooling system, right?

20:06.163 --> 20:08.745
Yeah. I figure
one of these things
probably just went haywire.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.205
They're fine.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.460
I checked them. Twice.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.504
Okay. Any ideas?

20:18.134 --> 20:20.716
Whatever happened in here
has nothing to do
with my equipment.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.926
Zane...
Excuse me,

20:23.055 --> 20:24.556
but I've got work to do.

in a hot bath.

Good. I was
worried about you.

I guess but, uh...

(QUIETLY) Jo, um,
about before,

21:01.927 --> 21:05.590
l was wrong to
leave town with...

21:06.682 --> 21:08.092
Without saying goodbye,

21:10.019 --> 21:12.431
to leave things
between us unsettled.

21:14.732 --> 21:15.767
I'm sorry.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.557
Me, too.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.815
It's important to me that
you and I remain friends.

I wouldn't want to
lose you from my life.

on your feet, I see.

at 100% capacity.

if that's good news
orbad.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.218
I did find
something interesting

21:46.347 --> 21:47.962
in that bit of ice
you gave me.

isn't, uh, normal.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.226
(STAMMERING) What
does that mean?

it's spreading.

to sample the core

that it wasn't damaged.

could just sign

(CHUCKLES) Well,
if you choose to focus
on the negative...

24:38.936 --> 24:41.427
Oh, there's a positive?
What's the positive?

24:41.563 --> 24:43.724
The elevator shafts
are filling with ice, okay?

24:43.857 --> 24:46.769
I'm using
iridium blowtorches
to melt frozen doors

24:46.902 --> 24:49.268
because my scientists
are trapped inside

24:49.405 --> 24:52.067
so I would love to hear
something positive!

I think we're good.

24:58.038 --> 25:02.907

froze back as quickly
as we can melt it.

25:03.585 --> 25:04.711
Everyone is working
on this,

25:04.837 --> 25:06.373
everyone is talking
with everyone,

25:06.505 --> 25:08.621
but we still can't
find an answer.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.545
Maybe the person
who's not talking

25:12.678 --> 25:13.963
is the person
with the answer.

Yeah, right.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.594
Did you check
the power converter?

25:23.731 --> 25:25.141
Yeah, I checked it.

25:25.274 --> 25:26.889
This is why I like people
instead of machines.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.937
People don't have
power converters.

about this so much?

25:38.954 --> 25:41.570
I think you could
really enjoy robotics,
that's all.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.911
Well, it's been
a ton of fun so far.

25:45.669 --> 25:48.877
And there are some amazing
college programs around.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.215
Like MIT?

25:54.511 --> 25:56.763
They have one of the
best robotics programs
in the country, so...

25:56.889 --> 26:00.256
Yeah, they do.
And they don't have
a medical school.

26:04.354 --> 26:05.343
We could go together.

26:05.481 --> 26:07.221
That's not the reason.

26:08.609 --> 26:10.315
That's not the only reason.

you could be great
at this.

99.8% of the time.
Remember?

26:16.408 --> 26:18.899
Okay. I'll just check
the converter again.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.245
Uh, Zane, hey.
Can we ask you
a few questions?

26:24.374 --> 26:26.080
I'm kind of busy.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.917

what you figured out
about the ice.

was working on it.

seem to be as worried

27:56.842 --> 28:01.006

found ice crystals growing
inside of him.

to melt the ice deposits
using an ultrasonic patch.

like the ice that's
been around G.D...

will help him for
a little while, but then...

No, no, that's just
the ice crystals.

from the inside out.

Even Petrotech
can't keep him warm.

33:41.645 --> 33:42.885
Wait.

33:43.897 --> 33:46.479
The difference between
Zane and Taggart

33:47.609 --> 33:48.894
is the Petrotech.

33:49.736 --> 33:52.022
You nailed it, Carter.
The regenerative insulation
in Petrotech

33:52.155 --> 33:54.020
is just like
the sheaths around
the fungus spores.

Yeah, the Petrotech
is like a fertilizer,
and the fungus is...

33:56.868 --> 33:57.983
Well, like a fungus.

33:58.119 --> 34:01.247
Well, the ice is using
the Petrotech as a base
to spread everywhere.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.489

the structural integrity
of the building.

Good news? Good news?

34:09.923 --> 34:12.505

about to fall down.

Maybe not what?

was made of Petrotech.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.011
It's bonded
into the walls, the windows.

34:27.148 --> 34:28.888

to keep them from icing over.

Dad, something weird
is happening here.

34:34.531 --> 34:37.273
We can't get out.
And it's freezing.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.532
We're in trouble.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.757
Zane, how are
you feeling?

34:57.304 --> 35:00.421
Ever had a brain freeze?
Try that
times about a thousand.

35:00.557 --> 35:01.967
Uh, good news
and bad news.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.716
We've isolated the fungus
and figured out a way
to kill it.

35:04.853 --> 35:08.641
But the bad news is,
the bug is showing the
first signs of mutation.

35:08.773 --> 35:10.513
It's a natural process.

35:10.650 --> 35:13.392
But we let it get
a few more generations
down the road

35:13.528 --> 35:15.564
and, uh,
our fix won't work.

35:15.697 --> 35:17.813
That mutation means
an unstoppable
worldwide ice age

in a matter of days.

35:19.075 --> 35:20.906
We gotta
stop this bug now.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.777
Yeah, the modified
fungicide might
be able to kill it.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.119
It's getting at it
that's the problem.

35:25.248 --> 35:26.237
We can't spray it
from the air.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.161
The fix needs to
literally get inside
every wall in town.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.706
Now you know
why I had you looking
at emergency plans.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.794
Was there not
one for this?

35:36.301 --> 35:39.259
TESS: Will the emergency
communication system
be able to reach everyone?

35:39.387 --> 35:40.968
According to this,
the network of tubes
leads from here

35:41.097 --> 35:42.678
to every building
in town.

35:42.807 --> 35:43.796
So...

35:43.933 --> 35:46.800
So the tubes
go into the walls

35:46.936 --> 35:48.722
where the Petrotech
is, right?

35:48.855 --> 35:50.641
We create an aerosol
version of the fungicide

35:50.774 --> 35:53.937
and pump the cure
all over G.D. and
then the town.

35:56.738 --> 35:57.898
You're a genius.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.649
Well,
not so much.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.900
We'll need to build a pump
with exactly the right kind
of pressure.

36:03.787 --> 36:05.573
(RUMBLING)
Yeah, before the
building falls.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.286
Okay, I'll run
an algorithm
to figure out

36:07.415 --> 36:08.621
how to disperse
the fungicide.

36:08.750 --> 36:09.910
All right, good.
I'll go to Cafe Diem.

36:10.043 --> 36:11.874
The roads are
all iced over.
You'll never make it.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.244
I might be able
to lend a hand
with that.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.373
(DOGS BARKING)

36:18.802 --> 36:21.088
Just like old times, eh?

36:21.763 --> 36:23.845
I hate old times!

36:26.851 --> 36:29.433
Damn it! Why did
I waste my butane
on creme brulee?

36:29.562 --> 36:32.770
Zoe, can you see if
there's any more cartridges
in the back, please?

36:32.899 --> 36:34.605
(SIGHS) Sure.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.608

We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

LUCAS: Vincent
will get us out.

36:46.830 --> 36:50.698
No, he won't. The ice
is growing faster than
he can cut through it.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.745
Your dad is
coming, right?

36:53.378 --> 36:55.835
The temperature's
dropping 15 degrees
every 10 minutes.

36:55.964 --> 36:58.876
I mean,
we'll freeze to death
before anyone gets here.

36:59.634 --> 37:00.874
Death?

37:01.761 --> 37:03.137
(GASPS) Death!

37:03.763 --> 37:04.798

built for this.

but the sky might
actually fall in here.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.648
(CREAKING)
Uh, start a back up.

37:20.780 --> 37:23.772
Open up the vents
on system branch B.

37:27.412 --> 37:28.527
How many buildings
in town is that?

37:28.663 --> 37:30.199
Maybe half.

37:30.331 --> 37:31.320
Okay, we're
getting there.

Where is everybody?

37:48.558 --> 37:49.889
Think they
found a way out?

37:52.604 --> 37:54.845
Maybe
they found themselves
a toasty corner

37:54.981 --> 37:56.687
to wait for
the cavalry, huh?

37:58.193 --> 37:59.603
Toasty corner.

in the walk-in fridge.
Downright brilliant!

38:16.169 --> 38:18.660
It was Zoe's idea.
Everyone else
was freaking out.

There's a wall panel,

for bringing me back.

for this.

to med school.

what you thought
you should do

giving you stupid advice.

it was just my gut feeling.

Like getting in the fridge
to stay warm, right?
