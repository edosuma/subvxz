-Hey.

02:09.754 --> 02:11.881
You're one of them types like my dad, huh?

02:16.511 --> 02:17.971
Cool. Come on.

[voices whispering indistinctly]

02:43.705 --> 02:45.790
[Dion] I can't find my pencil socks.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.667
Look on top of your dresser.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.545
[Dion] Can you help me?

02:50.628 --> 02:51.504
[knocking at door]

02:53.047 --> 02:54.966
Mom, can you help me?

02:56.259 --> 02:57.093
Mom.

03:04.851 --> 03:05.935
-Hey.
-Hi.

03:06.811 --> 03:08.396
Uh, how are you?

03:08.897 --> 03:09.981
Oh, I like that--

03:10.064 --> 03:11.566
Um, I like this, uh, shirt.

03:11.649 --> 03:12.692
It's a nice color.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.028
Um, colors. I like all the colors.

03:15.111 --> 03:17.238
Is it just the collar ones,
and then it just kinda--

03:17.322 --> 03:18.406
-Thanks.
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.867
-No, just... Sorry. Yep.
-Dion, Pat's here.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.161
[Dion] I'm trying to find my pencil sock.

03:23.244 --> 03:24.204
Oh. [chuckles]

03:25.038 --> 03:26.623
He loves those socks. [inhales]

03:27.916 --> 03:28.750
Uh...

03:29.667 --> 03:30.919
-How are you doing?
-Uh...

03:31.002 --> 03:33.296
-Are we okay. [stammers] Are you okay?
-Oh, I'm... I'm good.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.547
-Okay, yeah.
-We're...

03:34.923 --> 03:36.925
-We're... We're good.
-Okay, um...

03:37.008 --> 03:39.052
-We're good. [chuckles]
-Yeah, I, uh...

03:39.135 --> 03:40.011
That's good.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.889
Oh, I-I...
I do want to show you something.

03:42.972 --> 03:43.806
[Pat] Oh.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.688
-Oh, can I?
-Yeah, yeah.

03:54.859 --> 03:55.693
[Pat] Huh.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.739
-This looks like data on the aurora event.
-Yeah.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.992
I found a chip in Mark's watch.

04:05.036 --> 04:05.954
Whoa.

04:06.037 --> 04:09.040
-Hey, Dion, come on. Hurry up.
-[Dion] Trying to find my pencil sock.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.459
And I can't open a lot of these files.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.295
[exhales] Yeah, he must have used
BIONA's encryption.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.881
[inhales] The only way
you can unlock it is with...

04:17.465 --> 04:19.550
their proprietary algorithm.

04:20.385 --> 04:23.471
I could take it into work,
open the files there.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.265
I-I would, except, um...

04:25.932 --> 04:28.810
You were right.
I-I don't think Mark trusted them.

04:28.893 --> 04:32.355
And you saw the way Suzanne
was sniffing around Dion at the party.

04:32.438 --> 04:33.606
Yeah. Yeah.

04:33.898 --> 04:34.732
Um...

04:35.066 --> 04:37.277
[sucks air] Yeah, I get that, but I...

04:38.236 --> 04:40.238
Don't you want to just know
what else is on the card?

04:40.321 --> 04:42.865
-Yeah, but not enough to risk my kid.
-[running footsteps]

04:42.949 --> 04:44.325
-Hey, no running.
-[Dion] Sorry.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.411
Found it.

04:48.746 --> 04:49.664
Yes!

04:49.998 --> 04:51.541
I'm almost ready.

04:53.459 --> 04:54.335
Woop, woop!

-Oh, are you okay?
-[Pat] Yeah.

04:57.964 --> 04:58.798
Uh...

04:59.340 --> 05:00.425
Migraine's back.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.302
What's migraine?

05:02.385 --> 05:04.095
Um, it's a really bad headache.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.515
Your grandpa used to get them
all the time. Here.

05:07.598 --> 05:08.433
Oh, sorry.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.478
It was, uh, so bad that, uh...

05:13.021 --> 05:15.356
[ice cubes rattling]

05:15.440 --> 05:18.026

all the lights.

[chuckles]

05:24.032 --> 05:24.866
Thanks, Di.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.035
I'm good, though.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.370
-Tilt your head forward.
-Huh? Oh.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.249
Ooh.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.960
Yeah, my mom used to do this for my dad.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.131
It should ease the tension.

05:42.133 --> 05:43.092
[moans] Oh.

05:46.679 --> 05:47.597
Oh.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.474

05:51.517 --> 05:53.519
Hey, I'm gonna be late. Come on.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.438
Okay, yeah.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.316
-Oh, thank you so much. That is...
-Yeah.

05:58.816 --> 05:59.734
Oh. Whoo.

05:59.817 --> 06:00.735
All right, let's go.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.945
Oh, can we... can we talk later? Just...

06:03.029 --> 06:04.030
Yeah, yeah, of course.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.990
-Two minutes. Okay, yeah.
-[Dion whooping]

06:06.074 --> 06:08.493
-[Nicole] No running.
-[Dion] Okay. Thank you.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.578
Hey, hey. Let me tie your shoe. Come on.

06:14.707 --> 06:17.502
[Nicole] I do not know what I'm doing.

06:17.585 --> 06:18.586
[Tessa chuckles]

06:18.669 --> 06:21.923
-[Nicole] He's a good guy.
-[Tessa] But? Hand me that hair tie.

06:24.550 --> 06:28.638
He's Pat, you know?
I never really thought of him that way.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.224
Well, he's thought of you that way.
[laughs]

06:31.516 --> 06:34.560
But it's weird.
He was my husband's best friend.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.188
Do you know how many
of my husband's friends have hit on me?

06:37.271 --> 06:38.439
I don't, because I lost count.

06:38.940 --> 06:39.774
[laughs]

06:39.857 --> 06:43.444
Look, it doesn't suck to have a nice guy
treat you like a woman, does it?

06:44.570 --> 06:45.405
No.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.449
All right then, girl.
Have you some fun. Come on.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.868
-You never know. He might surprise you.
-[woman] Ooh.

06:50.952 --> 06:51.869
Ooh-hoo-hoo.

06:52.286 --> 06:55.498
You never know, girl. Ooh-whoo!

06:56.791 --> 06:58.876
-[laughs]
-[Nicole] Mmm, you know...

06:58.960 --> 07:02.213
But he is so good with Dion, you know,
and I just don't want to mess that up.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.841
Things got messed up whether
you wanted them to or not, all right?

07:04.924 --> 07:08.136
Look, he wants to take you out,
have a good time, I say let him.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.679
Let him, girl.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.722
-A nice restaurant.
-[woman] Mm-hmm.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.933
[Tessa] Get you some appetizers
and dinner.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.894
Dessert, after dessert and appetizers.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.521
-[laughs]
-[Tessa] I'm telling you.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.649
-Shoot. We could all go to dinner.
-[woman] Mm-hmm.

07:21.732 --> 07:22.567
Does he have friends?

07:22.650 --> 07:23.693
-[laughs]
-Is that too far?

07:23.776 --> 07:25.153
That's too much. That's too much.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.612
Keep your head still, please.

07:26.696 --> 07:27.905
[laughs]

07:28.281 --> 07:31.617
Did you know that storm clouds
can grow up to 20,000 feet?

07:31.951 --> 07:34.454
Which is almost 67 football fields.

07:34.537 --> 07:35.705
[Pat] I did.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.833
Well, not the...
not the football field bit, but...

07:39.292 --> 07:41.127
-Mm-hmm.
-Big storms are cool.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.170
[chuckles]

07:42.920 --> 07:44.547
Hey, you know what else is cool?

07:44.922 --> 07:47.592
Remember that Arctic fox we saw at BIONA?

07:47.967 --> 07:50.011
The one with the weird sores?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.513
Not anymore. Because they healed.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.975
-He's still alive?
-And kicking.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.102
Or... Or foxing.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.354
Did you do something to him?

08:00.438 --> 08:01.814
I told him to get better.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.318
But did you... did you touch him, or...?

08:06.360 --> 08:07.987
I touched the glass.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.114
I was really worried about him.

08:13.409 --> 08:14.952
I think you healed him, buddy.

08:15.620 --> 08:16.871
I can heal things?

08:16.954 --> 08:20.249
I don't think we have any idea
what you can do yet.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.460
[thunder rumbles]

08:24.712 --> 08:26.005
All right. Oh.

08:27.381 --> 08:28.633
Does your head hurt?

08:28.716 --> 08:30.092
I... I'll be fine.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.678
Uh, have a good day at school, all right?

08:33.596 --> 08:35.890
-What are you doing?
-Fixing your headache.

08:36.432 --> 08:38.100
-No, wait, wait. Don't--
-[grunts]

08:40.144 --> 08:42.313
Dion, stop. Stop, stop, stop. Let go.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.191
-Stop! [grunts]
-[grunts loudly]

08:46.651 --> 08:48.277
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.487
[grunts] I'm okay.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.697
You're way bigger than a fox. [gasps]

08:51.781 --> 08:53.616
Sure you're okay?
Maybe we should call your mom.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.284
No, she'll get in trouble at work.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.828
-She'll wanna know if you're sick.
-I'm fine, see?

08:57.912 --> 08:59.580
[makes funny sounds]

08:59.664 --> 09:00.831
[scoffs, chuckles]

09:00.915 --> 09:02.375
-Well...
-I gotta go.

09:02.458 --> 09:03.334
All right, but...

09:04.377 --> 09:05.920
[rain pattering]

09:20.017 --> 09:21.435
[thunder rumbles]

09:22.770 --> 09:24.480
[children laughing and chattering]

09:25.022 --> 09:27.275
[school bell rings]

09:30.403 --> 09:31.654
I still don't get it.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.740
When the warm air meets cold air,
you get a storm.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.702
Okay, well,
where does the warm air come from?

09:37.785 --> 09:42.081
He's trying to explain how a storm is made
so we can figure out how to stop one.

09:42.164 --> 09:43.249
Keep going.

09:43.332 --> 09:46.294
[inhales] Okay, well,
if you could cool the warm air,

09:46.377 --> 09:48.462
the storm loses power, okay?

09:48.713 --> 09:51.048
So, then, we wouldn't have
so much hurricanes.

09:51.132 --> 09:55.094
I've got it. We can make a gun
that shoots cold air into the sky.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.889
We're gonna make a gun? In school?

10:01.225 --> 10:03.936
Right. Uh... So, not a gun.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.397
More like a, uh, fire extinguisher,

10:06.480 --> 10:07.356
but big.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.649
That's an awesome idea.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.026
It is?

10:10.484 --> 10:13.195
My mom's boyfriend's a mechanic.
Maybe he can help.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.115
It can be on a backpack, like this.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.286
Whoa! You're a good drawer.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.832
The Storm Killer!

10:25.082 --> 10:26.334
I like it.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.419
[groans]

10:29.295 --> 10:30.338
[Dion groans]

10:31.088 --> 10:32.089
You all right, Dion?

10:32.882 --> 10:35.301
[Dion] Mmm, I don't feel so good.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.721
Everyone, keep working.

10:38.804 --> 10:42.016
I'm taking Dion to the nurse's office,
but I'll be right back, okay?

10:42.099 --> 10:43.726
Come on, stand up for me. Stand up.

10:45.227 --> 10:48.272
-[child 1] I hope you feel better.
-[child 2] Yeah, feel better.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.358
[Mr. Fry] You all right?

10:51.317 --> 10:52.610
[telephone rings]

10:53.027 --> 10:54.987
[woman] The Lewis Company. May I help you?

10:58.574 --> 10:59.408
[Rashad] Hey, hey.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.663
You good to dance today?
Because I got a dope idea for a new combo.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.289
You know, I can't today.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.583
I have a million things
I need to figure out.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.668
Like what?

11:09.251 --> 11:10.127
Um...

11:10.211 --> 11:14.090
Work stuff, Dion stuff,
personal stuff I need to figure out.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.592
You know when you should do that?
Any time except lunch.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.053
-That's your time, remember?
-I know, but...

11:19.136 --> 11:21.263
[Rashad] There's always gonna be
a million things.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.141
Leave it outside for half an hour.
Give yourself that.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.521
I'll see you at lunch.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.314
Mm-hmm.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.318
[cell phone rings and vibrates]

11:36.278 --> 11:37.113
Hello?

11:40.908 --> 11:42.076
[knocks] Kwame?

11:42.159 --> 11:44.620
Oh, could your timing
be any more perfect?

11:45.121 --> 11:47.832
I pitched your ideas to the team,
they ate them up.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.166
That's amazing, uh, but--

11:49.250 --> 11:51.752
Take this to the graphic designer,
walk him through your changes.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.295
Dion's school called, he has a fever.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.006
I have to pick him up,
so maybe I can handle the poster tomorrow.

11:56.090 --> 11:56.924
No.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.969
They have to start the print run today,
or we have to pay a rush charge.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.471
-Well, Dion's sick, so--
-So find someone to pick him up.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.435
You realize this is an opportunity, right?

12:08.269 --> 12:10.771
Those health benefits are gonna be
more important in the long run

12:10.855 --> 12:12.273
than who picks him up today.

12:19.071 --> 12:19.905
[sighs]

[woman] Hmm.

12:49.643 --> 12:50.478
[Kat] Mm.

12:50.644 --> 12:51.729
You're tense.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.648
WebMD hypochondriac?

12:55.816 --> 12:58.360
Phelps kept talking over me
to my patients.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.487
Again?

13:00.029 --> 13:01.572
What is his problem with you?

13:01.906 --> 13:04.617
Uh... Well, I can think of two
right off the bat.

13:05.826 --> 13:06.786
I'll speak to him.

13:06.869 --> 13:10.080
No! I can't have my girlfriend
beating up the bully.

13:10.164 --> 13:13.876
Well, this is a teaching hospital.
He's supposed to be learning.

13:13.959 --> 13:17.087
Oh, come here, baby.
Let's just take a nap. I'm tired.

What do you need?

13:26.597 --> 13:28.682
Dion's sick and I'm stuck at work.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.601
Can you please pick him up
and take him home?

13:30.684 --> 13:32.937
[Kat] <i>Oh, what happened</i>
<i>to your new best friend?</i>

13:33.020 --> 13:34.605
-What are you talking about?
-[Kat] <i>Pat.</i>

13:35.272 --> 13:38.275
Yeah, I can't call him.
It's... It's complicated.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.070
Oh, my God, you slept with him.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.656
No. Stop. Can you pick him up or not?

13:45.115 --> 13:46.033
I got you.

13:46.116 --> 13:49.245
Thank you. Just pick him up,
take him home,

13:49.328 --> 13:51.372
and I will get there
as soon as I possibly can.

-That might be the problem.

Up you go. You doing okay?

14:10.224 --> 14:11.100
Here you go.

14:12.893 --> 14:13.769
In there.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.357
Hey, Bug. How you doing?

14:18.649 --> 14:21.485
[sighs] I don't like this feeling,
Auntie Kat.

14:21.569 --> 14:24.321
It's okay. We'll get you back to normal

Okay, change of plans.

Hey, what's up?

14:44.049 --> 14:44.884
Um...

14:45.217 --> 14:48.971
So, basically, it's your original design,
with a few changes.

14:49.054 --> 14:49.889
What?

14:50.806 --> 14:52.558
-Are you kidding me?
-[phone chimes]

14:53.225 --> 14:54.602

All right, um...

Big heart or little hearts?

15:27.051 --> 15:27.885
[inhales]

15:27.968 --> 15:28.886
Big heart or...

15:28.969 --> 15:30.471
Little hearts are cute.

15:31.221 --> 15:32.181
Cute's not sexy.

No! Idiot.

Hey.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.205
I don't know what "Was ho" means,
but Dion's in the ER.

-Wh-- [grunts]

16:02.002 --> 16:04.046
When did he get sick?
He was fine this morning.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.130
Yeah, well, he's not now,

16:05.214 --> 16:07.633
and I need to get there
before they run tests on him, you know?

16:07.716 --> 16:09.176
If they find out what he can do...

16:09.259 --> 16:11.470
-What... What do you need from me?
-Um, okay.

16:11.553 --> 16:12.972
[keyboard clacking]

Uh, Waze says that I'm 40 minutes
from the hospital,

16:15.474 --> 16:18.060
but I'm just leaving work now.
I mean, you're closer. Can... Can...

16:18.143 --> 16:20.187

I'll head there right now.

-[woman] Hello, Doctor.
-Hey. Um, he has a high fever.

16:26.527 --> 16:27.653
I need to take a look.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.738
Room 430's open.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.031
Thanks. Come on, buddy.

16:33.993 --> 16:34.868
-[woman] Hey.
-Hey.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.121
-What's going on?
-He has a pretty high fever,

16:37.204 --> 16:39.164
and he has asthma
and I think it's making it worse,

16:39.248 --> 16:41.625
so I just... I just want to make sure
he's okay.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.003
Hi, Dion. Remember me?

16:44.253 --> 16:45.254
I'm Danielle.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.213
[groans]

16:46.505 --> 16:49.842
Hmm. You should scan his lungs
once he's stable.

16:49.925 --> 16:52.970
-Thanks. I got it.
-Trying to be helpful.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.389
-I know, it's just...
-[Danielle] I understand.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.058
Let's get him into a bed.

Come on. [grunts] Thank you.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.235

[Dion] Mom.

17:28.922 --> 17:32.217
[Kat] Before we run any tests, we need
to lower this fever. Grab ice packs.

-Audra, I need you to run a line.
-[Audra] You got it.

-I feel really weird.
-I know, baby. I'm right here.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.392
You're gonna feel better in no time, okay?

17:40.726 --> 17:43.520
Don't look at that. Just look at me.

[heart rate monitor beeping steadily]

17:58.577 --> 18:00.537
[Kat] Dion! Dion!

18:01.121 --> 18:01.997
Did he pass out?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.583
He's dehydrated.
The IV should work quickly.

18:21.850 --> 18:22.935
What the hell?

18:25.354 --> 18:26.522
Get me more ice.

Hi. Uh, I'm here for Dion Warren.
Can you tell me what room he's in?

18:36.573 --> 18:37.407
Your name?

18:37.491 --> 18:40.452
Rollins. Um, Pat Rollins.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.538
-And are you family?
-Yeah.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.791
Yeah. Um, like, friend of the family.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.126
Um...

18:47.501 --> 18:49.753
Like, Mom's... friend.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.089
Um, godfather.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.215
I am his godfather.

18:53.298 --> 18:56.343
Room 430, but only relatives
are allowed in the room.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.594
Okay, but--

18:57.678 --> 18:59.638
There's a visitors lounge.
You can wait there.

-Can I have my watch?
-[Kat] Yes, baby.

19:16.321 --> 19:17.364
Here you go.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.576
All right.
I just need to get a blood sample.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.787
-It'll just take a second.
-[groans]

19:23.871 --> 19:25.622
Don't worry. This won't hurt.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.374
All right.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.127
-You doing okay?
-[groans]

19:30.878 --> 19:32.963
-It's almost over.
-Superheroes don't cry.

19:33.046 --> 19:34.464
Superheroes don't cry.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.758
Hey, you're eight years old.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.385
It's okay to cry.

19:38.802 --> 19:39.720
Kat.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.931
[Kat] Look at that. I'm all done.

19:43.932 --> 19:44.766
You did it.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.018
-[Danielle] Kat.
-Yep.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.604
-Can you come take a look at these?
-I'll be right back, okay?

19:53.984 --> 19:56.111
These are useless. How did that happen?

19:56.195 --> 19:57.529
I couldn't tell you.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.199
They tried it three times
and they all came out like this.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.992
Does nothing work properly in this place?

20:03.493 --> 20:05.370
[sighs] I should get this down to the lab.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.455
Auntie Kat.

20:07.664 --> 20:10.000
I'll be right back, buddy.
Just rest, okay?

20:10.083 --> 20:12.669
-Look, stay. I'll get it to the lab.
-Are you sure?

20:12.753 --> 20:14.129
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.506
-He should be with family.
-Thank you, honey.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.181
My brother was a gifted farmer.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.766
[rooster crows]

20:25.849 --> 20:27.392
After his wife passed away,

20:27.476 --> 20:31.563
he looked after this whole farm
all by himself for years.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.318
Seeing the farm like this
would have killed him,

20:36.401 --> 20:37.569
if he hadn't already...

20:39.988 --> 20:42.032
I am so sorry for your loss.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.577
How was it you said you knew Walter?

20:46.119 --> 20:48.789
We met in Iceland a few years ago.

20:49.164 --> 20:50.415
The meteor shower.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.543
I thought he was crazy.

20:54.044 --> 20:57.047
Going all that way
just to look up at the sky.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.467
Then, after he got back,

21:01.551 --> 21:03.679
that's when his luck started to change.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.808
His farm started thriving, prospering.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.644
Like God was finally looking out for him.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.604
Can you tell me what happened to him?

21:13.730 --> 21:14.606
[sighs]

21:14.690 --> 21:17.609
It looks like some kind of localized storm
hit the field.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.987
Look, I know how tornadoes work, okay?

21:20.237 --> 21:23.156
Skipping over one house
and... and knocking down the next,

21:23.240 --> 21:25.617
you know, like it's, uh,
Duck, Duck, Goose.

21:25.701 --> 21:29.246
But this was the only house
that was even touched in the whole county.

21:30.622 --> 21:31.832
It took my brother.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.167
Disappeared.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.420
[Brayden] It was a man.

21:37.879 --> 21:38.880
Made of lightning.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.757
[woman] Brayden, that's enough.

21:40.841 --> 21:42.551
Brayden, did you see the man in the storm?

21:42.634 --> 21:43.760
[woman] I said that's enough.

21:44.553 --> 21:45.429
Upstairs.

21:46.972 --> 21:47.806
Now.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.143
Upstairs. Go on.

21:54.104 --> 21:56.106
Look, I loved my brother,

21:56.189 --> 21:59.109
but he was imbued
with the spirit of the devil,

21:59.901 --> 22:02.612
and he exposed Brayden
to that same darkness.

22:03.071 --> 22:06.241
He was claimed because of it.
That's my belief.

22:07.659 --> 22:10.787
[Brayden, in Charlotte's mind]
<i>She's wrong. That's not what happened.</i>

22:11.163 --> 22:12.998
[Charlotte] <i>Brayden? Is that you?</i>

22:13.081 --> 22:15.334
[Brayden] <i>Meet me outside in the garden.</i>

22:19.212 --> 22:20.047
Are you all right?

22:28.388 --> 22:31.892
[man over PA] <i>Dr. Wallace to CCU.</i>
<i>Dr. Wallace to CCU.</i>

22:35.854 --> 22:37.064
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:37.147 --> 22:38.690
-Is he okay?
-Uh, I-I think so.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.525
I haven't been here long.
Maybe half an hour.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.528
I tried to see him, but they wouldn't
let me in 'cause I'm not family, so...

22:43.612 --> 22:44.613
Okay. Is Kat here?

22:44.696 --> 22:46.948
Yeah, she's been in there with him
the whole time.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.117
I don't think he's done anything "super."

22:49.826 --> 22:51.953
-Oh! Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.373
-Thank you so much for being here.
-Of course, yeah.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.166
They're right down the hall, so we...

22:56.249 --> 22:57.250
Um...

22:57.334 --> 22:58.710
-Just down the hall?
-Yeah.

22:58.794 --> 23:01.088
-Okay, I'm gonna talk to Kat.
-Oh. Okay.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.298
-Yeah, just... Thank you.
-Yeah, of course.

23:05.550 --> 23:06.468
[Nicole sighs]

23:07.094 --> 23:07.969
Oh.

23:08.261 --> 23:11.723
Hey. Hey, sweetie, I'm here.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.850
Am I underwater?

23:13.934 --> 23:15.394
[Nicole] No, baby.

23:15.811 --> 23:19.147
Oh, you look so tired.
Do you... Do you wanna take a nap?

23:20.524 --> 23:22.401
Wake me up for school tomorrow.

23:22.901 --> 23:23.777
[Nicole] W-We'll see.

23:24.444 --> 23:25.612
[groans softly]

23:26.154 --> 23:28.365
[groaning softly]

23:28.448 --> 23:32.285
His fever is a little strange,
but he seems to be stabilizing.

23:32.953 --> 23:33.870
[groans softly]

23:35.705 --> 23:37.374
I told you to take him home.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.627
What happened to
"Thanks for saving my son's life, Kat"?

23:40.710 --> 23:43.296
It's not safe here for all these people.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.799
Not safe? What could happen, Nic?

23:46.341 --> 23:48.468
Tell me exactly what would happen
if you weren't here

23:48.552 --> 23:50.720
to protect the rest of us
from your sleeping child.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.931
He could hurt someone, with...

23:53.014 --> 23:54.015
[exhales]

23:54.099 --> 23:56.435
Are you still talking
this superpower nonsense?

23:57.561 --> 23:58.645
Get over here.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.024
I've been trying to let this thing slide,

24:03.108 --> 24:04.776
hoping it's not a symptom
of a bigger issue,

24:04.860 --> 24:06.653
but you just can't seem to let this go.

24:06.736 --> 24:08.196
Because it's real.

24:08.780 --> 24:12.325
-[sighs] I've been trying to tell you.
-Stop telling me and show me.

24:22.878 --> 24:23.837
[whispers] Sweetie.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.088
Mom?

24:25.547 --> 24:26.965
Hey, come on. Can we sit up?

24:27.299 --> 24:29.342
Oh, I'm sorry. Sit up, up, up, up.

24:31.052 --> 24:32.429
Time for school?

24:35.515 --> 24:39.144
I want you to show Auntie Kat
what you can do.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.396
Can you show her your powers?

24:41.938 --> 24:44.274
You said the black van could take me away.

24:45.275 --> 24:48.278
-You told him that?
-This is a special case.

24:49.154 --> 24:49.988
Okay?

24:50.614 --> 24:54.534
She needs to see what you can do
so she can help you get better. Okay?

24:55.577 --> 24:57.370
Maybe just lift something.

25:06.546 --> 25:07.380
[sighs]

25:08.423 --> 25:10.342
My head doesn't feel good.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.511
I need you to try, though.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.221
Okay?

25:15.764 --> 25:16.932
[sighs]

25:19.184 --> 25:21.645
Are we done
with this Munchausen-by-proxy bit?

25:21.728 --> 25:23.730
-It's not a good look.
-No, he can usually do it

25:23.813 --> 25:26.483
without even having to think about it.
Something must be really wrong.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.860
Something is really wrong,
with the both of you,

25:28.944 --> 25:30.737
but at least I can fix his situation.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.489
[footsteps depart]

25:32.572 --> 25:33.406
[door opens]

25:33.490 --> 25:35.200
[instrumental music plays]

25:51.091 --> 25:51.967
How is he?

25:52.676 --> 25:54.803
[heart rate monitor beeping steadily]

25:55.845 --> 25:58.390
Well, Kat says he's stabilizing,

25:58.473 --> 26:02.060
but he's delirious
and his fever won't go down.

26:02.477 --> 26:03.728
[Pat inhales deeply]

26:03.812 --> 26:04.813
Well... [exhales]

26:04.896 --> 26:07.023
she's not gonna let
anything happen to him, so...

26:07.107 --> 26:09.359
She doesn't even know
what she's dealing with.

26:09.693 --> 26:13.530
What if his powers are making him sick?
What if it's some superhero disease?

26:13.613 --> 26:16.700
It's not like they teach
superhero immunology at med school.

26:16.783 --> 26:17.659
[Pat inhales]

26:19.244 --> 26:21.121
I think I might have had
something to do with it.

26:22.455 --> 26:23.373
You? How?

26:23.456 --> 26:26.626
Well, this morning I told him
that he healed the fox at BIONA,

26:26.710 --> 26:30.213
and I guess he thought
he could heal my migraines, too.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.256
-Um...
-What?

26:31.339 --> 26:33.508
I-I stopped him
before it went too far,  but...

26:34.467 --> 26:36.636
I think it might have made him sick.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.681
I-I feel so awful. I'm... I'm sorry.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.474
But... the...

26:42.601 --> 26:45.145
The fox. When he healed the fox,
it didn't make him sick.

26:46.479 --> 26:48.273
I mean, I'm a lot bigger than a fox.

26:48.356 --> 26:51.276
So then, if this is
some kind of superhero illness,

26:51.359 --> 26:53.069
maybe there's a way to reverse it, right?

26:53.153 --> 26:55.947
I mean, w-what do they tell you
in the comic books and--

26:56.031 --> 26:59.117
-Maybe? I-I, uh, um...
-You're supposed to know this stuff.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.287
Well, you know that comic books
aren't real, right?

27:03.330 --> 27:04.247
I mean...

27:14.924 --> 27:17.010
You said Mark was studying himself, right?

27:17.093 --> 27:19.596
Because I could take that data card
to BIONA and decrypt the data

27:19.679 --> 27:21.014
and see if there's anything there.

27:21.097 --> 27:24.059
What about Suzanne?
Isn't she tracking the servers at BIONA?

27:24.142 --> 27:27.979
I mean, we could wait, but a doctor
could eventually find something abnormal,

27:28.063 --> 27:31.066
and at least this way we're ahead of them.

27:33.652 --> 27:37.864
If I had anything to do
with causing this mess...

27:38.990 --> 27:40.075
let me try to fix it.

27:42.243 --> 27:43.078
Please.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.539
[Dion groans softly]

27:55.757 --> 27:56.841
Okay.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.052
Gosh. Okay.

27:59.427 --> 28:02.180
I will guard this with my life. Okay.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.684

Shh. Mama's here, all right?

29:17.964 --> 29:19.257
There you go. Back down.

[heart rate monitor beeping steadily]

29:22.343 --> 29:23.470
Good. Good, good.

29:24.888 --> 29:27.515
See, now you want to float.
Not when I need you to.

29:27.599 --> 29:28.850
[chuckles]

29:28.933 --> 29:30.059
[door opens]

29:30.810 --> 29:33.521
Hey. His temperature is up to 106.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.231
We're still trying to diagnose him.

29:35.315 --> 29:38.359
Danielle is running his blood work,
and the results should be in soon.

29:38.818 --> 29:40.111
You-- You drew blood?

29:40.195 --> 29:41.654
Yes, it's standard procedure.

29:42.405 --> 29:44.616
No. No, no, no, no, no. You...

29:45.116 --> 29:47.994
You can't... You can't draw blood.
You have to get it back from Danielle.

29:48.077 --> 29:50.580
-She already submitted the samples.
-Well, then, get it back!

29:50.663 --> 29:53.208
I didn't... I didn't give permission
for you to take his blood.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.209
Are you kidding?

29:54.292 --> 29:56.503
We have to do whatever we can
to help him get better.

29:56.586 --> 29:59.255
You're not gonna make him better.
You're gonna put him at risk.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.423
Of what?

30:02.091 --> 30:04.803
Of the vans you told him
were gonna come take him away?

30:05.261 --> 30:06.930
You have lost your damn...

30:09.641 --> 30:10.517
Dion?

30:10.934 --> 30:11.976
What the hell?

30:22.821 --> 30:24.364
Oh, my God, no.

30:27.700 --> 30:30.245
What the hell? What the hell?
What the hell?

30:34.791 --> 30:35.834
[Kat sighs]

30:37.794 --> 30:38.628
It's okay.

30:38.711 --> 30:39.754
He floats, Nic.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.131
What the hell?

30:43.800 --> 30:44.968
[Kat sighs]

30:46.886 --> 30:47.971
[whispers] There's no...

30:48.054 --> 30:51.558
There's... There's no prescription,
no diagnosis.

30:52.433 --> 30:55.520
A thousand years of medical science,
and the boy floats?

30:59.107 --> 31:00.024
It's freaky.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.360
Yeah, I know. Just, uh...

31:03.111 --> 31:03.945
take a second.

31:04.654 --> 31:07.156
Oh, my God, and I didn't believe you.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.116
[Nicole] Aww.

31:08.908 --> 31:09.909
[Kat sniffs]

31:09.993 --> 31:10.952
[Nicole scoffs]

31:11.035 --> 31:13.872
There is so much that I have to tell you.

31:14.122 --> 31:14.956
I'm...

31:16.165 --> 31:17.458
I'm sorry, Niki.

31:18.376 --> 31:19.294
It's okay.

31:19.377 --> 31:22.797
It's not okay, because you've been
dealing with this alone.

31:23.464 --> 31:24.465
[Kat sighs]

31:25.633 --> 31:29.178
And to think I thought about
putting you on a 72-hour psychiatric hold.

31:30.847 --> 31:33.016
-You were gonna do what?
-I mean, I didn't do it.

31:34.851 --> 31:35.727
[Kat sighs]

31:37.312 --> 31:38.187
[stammers]

31:38.396 --> 31:42.525
Do you see now why I'm scared
to have him here in the hospital?

31:43.151 --> 31:45.194
[groans]

31:45.445 --> 31:47.697
Okay. Okay. Let's think about this.

31:48.656 --> 31:49.616
Okay, um...

31:50.742 --> 31:51.659
Who else knows?

31:52.952 --> 31:54.746
Pat, uh...

31:54.829 --> 31:56.956
And this woman, Charlotte.
She has abilities, too.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.958
There are more people like this?

32:00.043 --> 32:02.879
I mean, I don't know how many.
They like to keep under the radar.

32:04.672 --> 32:05.882
Oh, God.

32:06.257 --> 32:08.384
I gotta delete Dion's medical records.

32:09.969 --> 32:11.930
Wait, think about that.
Let's talk about it because

32:12.013 --> 32:14.974
-if you get caught, you could get fired.
-And if I don't delete them?

32:16.476 --> 32:18.311
I don't wanna think
about what could happen.

32:19.938 --> 32:20.980
You stay with Di.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.732
I'll let you know when it's done.

We should extract him.

I am really glad that it didn't get you.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.675
[sighs] I'd rather be with him.

35:35.758 --> 35:37.677
I hate this place without my dad.

35:40.179 --> 35:41.222
[exhales]

35:41.681 --> 35:42.849
I should go.

35:42.932 --> 35:43.808
Me too.

35:44.267 --> 35:45.852
-[Charlotte] What?
-Take me with you.

35:45.935 --> 35:47.019
No, no, I can't.

35:47.562 --> 35:50.690
-You have to.
-I... I can't. See, I alr...

35:52.108 --> 35:52.942
I can't.

35:53.609 --> 35:54.443
Who's Dion?

35:55.403 --> 35:57.572
You keep thinking
about someone named Dion.

35:58.656 --> 36:00.867
Is that why
you don't want to take me with you?

36:01.409 --> 36:03.327
Did Dion tell you to leave me here?

36:04.370 --> 36:06.664
[woman] Brayden. Supper's ready.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.875
I'll check on you, I promise.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.376
[Brayden] <i>You're lying!</i>

36:10.459 --> 36:11.961
<i>You're not coming back!</i>

36:12.044 --> 36:14.964
<i>-No, no, no, no. Stop it, Brayden.</i>
<i>-You're going to Dion.</i>

36:15.047 --> 36:16.132
[Charlotte] <i>I can't.</i>

36:16.215 --> 36:18.718
<i>Why are you helping Dion</i>
<i>but you won't help me?</i>

36:19.760 --> 36:21.637
<i>Don't leave me here.</i>

36:22.555 --> 36:24.390
<i>Come back!</i>

36:25.641 --> 36:27.602
[birds cawing]

36:41.199 --> 36:42.408
[keyboard clacking]

36:49.832 --> 36:53.294
I've been looking for you.
Dion's blood work will be done any minute.

36:55.171 --> 36:56.005
Kat?

36:56.464 --> 36:57.298
[Kat] Yeah.

36:57.590 --> 36:58.591
What's going on?

37:06.515 --> 37:07.475
What are you doing?

37:09.018 --> 37:10.895
Who gave you permission
to delete these files?

37:10.978 --> 37:13.856
-Just... Just give me a sec.
-What the hell are you doing?

37:15.107 --> 37:16.234
I know how this looks,

37:16.317 --> 37:18.861
but I'm just asking that you trust
that I'm doing the right thing.

37:18.945 --> 37:19.904
Trust you?

37:20.529 --> 37:22.323
You're deleting
your nephew's medical records,

37:22.406 --> 37:24.784
and it sounds like you're asking me
to ignore that fact.

37:24.867 --> 37:27.495
Do you think I would do this
if it wasn't important?

37:27.787 --> 37:29.163
It's for Nicole and Dion.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.499
Why does your sister need you
to breach protocol?

37:31.582 --> 37:33.709
I'm protecting my family.

37:35.211 --> 37:36.963
I thought we were gonna be family.

37:37.046 --> 37:39.215
I'm asking you to keep a secret,

37:39.799 --> 37:42.176
like how you asked me
to keep our relationship a secret.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.971
Because no one should attribute
your success to me.

37:45.054 --> 37:46.472
You're a gifted doctor.

37:46.555 --> 37:49.016
Why are you risking your career
over this?

37:49.809 --> 37:53.354
For the last time,
please tell me what's going on.

37:54.522 --> 37:55.439
[Kat sighs]

38:02.405 --> 38:04.073
I'm taking you off this case.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.744
I'll tell the board about us
and take the consequences.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.830
You should be prepared for the same.

38:14.875 --> 38:15.960
[sighs]

38:20.673 --> 38:21.507
[sighs]

38:24.468 --> 38:25.386
[exhales]

38:27.722 --> 38:28.889
[phone chimes]

38:31.475 --> 38:32.893
[monitor beeping]

38:36.605 --> 38:39.525
His temperature is 107.
Y-You need to do something.

38:39.608 --> 38:42.570
His iodine level
is one and a half times what it should be.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.905
-Well, what does that mean?
-That means I know how to help.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.282
But we have to move fast.

38:46.365 --> 38:48.868
Danielle caught me
deleting Dion's medical records.

38:49.118 --> 38:50.828
-[monitor beeping]
-[Dion groaning]

38:50.911 --> 38:53.289
-Wait, what's happening to him? Di? Di?
-Look, calm down.

38:53.372 --> 38:54.790
Go there, put more ice packs on him.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.376
-It's not doing anything. He's burning up.
-It is doing something.

38:57.460 --> 38:58.878
It's going to lower his temperature.

38:58.961 --> 39:01.380
-You said he was stabilizing, Kat.
-Calm down.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.508
[woman] Security should be here
in a moment.

39:04.592 --> 39:05.676
[Danielle] Thank you.

39:06.802 --> 39:10.306
Can you check on the vitals
of a patient for me? Room 430?

39:10.389 --> 39:11.307
Of course.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.310
This can't be right.

39:14.393 --> 39:17.772
The patient's temperature is 115.

39:18.230 --> 39:19.774
Is it a hemorrhagic fever?

39:21.192 --> 39:22.151
[Danielle sighs]

39:23.402 --> 39:24.904
I don't know what it is.

39:24.987 --> 39:27.073
-Uh...
-[dialing]

39:29.033 --> 39:29.950
I got it. I...

39:30.451 --> 39:31.660
-Oh, no, she knows.
-Hey, Pat.

39:31.744 --> 39:32.745
-She knows, she knows.
-Oh.

39:32.828 --> 39:36.165
So, okay, so, um, Mark ran
a bunch of tests on himself.

39:36.248 --> 39:38.959
Blood work, physicals, genome tests,
MRIs, you name it.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.170
-What is that there?
-[Kat] This is to lower his iodine.

39:41.253 --> 39:43.130
[Pat] Lower?
No, no, no, no, that'll kill him.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.509
Um, the aurora event
changed Mark's body chemistry.

39:46.592 --> 39:48.928
He actually had twice
the normal iodine levels.

39:49.011 --> 39:50.888
So Dion needs more iodine, not less.

39:50.971 --> 39:52.973
-[Kat] I-I can... I can work with this.
-[Pat] Okay.

39:54.850 --> 39:55.684
Okay.

39:59.313 --> 40:00.439
[Kat] Iodine's going in.

40:00.523 --> 40:01.899
[monitor beeping]

[Dion groans]

40:03.484 --> 40:04.693

40:09.240 --> 40:10.991
[continues groaning]

40:11.784 --> 40:14.954
[continues groaning]

40:15.871 --> 40:16.705
What do we do?

40:16.789 --> 40:18.791
[continues groaning]

40:26.465 --> 40:27.425
[grunts, gasps]

40:27.508 --> 40:29.009

40:32.930 --> 40:33.764
[Pat groans]

40:34.223 --> 40:35.057
[grunts]

40:35.558 --> 40:36.392
Mom?

40:36.475 --> 40:38.436
[monitor beeping steadily]

40:39.770 --> 40:40.896
[shaky inhale] Dion?

40:42.273 --> 40:43.899
-Hi, Mom.
-[Nicole gasps]

40:43.983 --> 40:45.067
[Nicole chuckles] Hi.

40:47.194 --> 40:48.612
Oh! [chuckles]

40:48.696 --> 40:49.613
-[kisses]
-[Dion grunts]

40:49.697 --> 40:50.698
[Kat chuckles]

40:50.990 --> 40:52.408
-[exhales] Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.368
[Dion] I can't breathe!

40:54.618 --> 40:56.036
-[gasps for air]
-[Nicole chuckles]

40:56.120 --> 40:58.038
Don't kill him. We just got him better.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.915
-[Nicole kisses]
-[Dion chuckles]

41:00.916 --> 41:02.918
-Auntie Kat, Pat?
-[Kat] Hey, buddy.

41:03.002 --> 41:03.836
[Pat chuckles]

41:04.253 --> 41:06.046
-Mom?
-Little bug!

41:06.130 --> 41:06.964
[door opens]

41:09.175 --> 41:11.719
-His fever broke. He's okay.
-Good.

41:13.345 --> 41:15.181
I still need you to come with me.

41:15.264 --> 41:17.558
No, this is on me.
Whatever the punishment is, I'll take it.

41:18.184 --> 41:20.519
-That's not how this works.
-Nic.

41:21.562 --> 41:22.438
It's okay.

41:42.500 --> 41:46.086
Lars, the hospital just called in an alert
to the CDC.

41:46.795 --> 41:49.298
They need
a secure level-three quarantine facility.

41:58.057 --> 41:59.308
Hey, where are you going?

41:59.850 --> 42:00.768
I have to pee.

42:01.852 --> 42:04.647
-Okay, I'll take you. Come here.
-I can go by myself.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.982
I've been doing that
for, like, six years now.

42:07.608 --> 42:09.443
With varying degrees of success.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.445
Yeah, but he's got his watch on,
so he'll be okay.

42:11.529 --> 42:12.738
-Right?
-Yep.

42:13.614 --> 42:15.032
-Wash your hands.
-Six years!

42:15.115 --> 42:15.991
[door closes]

42:18.077 --> 42:20.120
-Could we--
-So how does it feel to be the hero?

42:20.204 --> 42:21.080
[chuckles]

42:21.163 --> 42:22.414
Uh, it...

42:22.498 --> 42:23.707
feels good. [chuckles]

42:23.791 --> 42:24.917
Yeah, well it should.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.295
[clears throat] Um...

42:28.546 --> 42:30.422
I'm sorry about last night.

42:30.798 --> 42:32.007
-I just...
-It's fine.

42:32.091 --> 42:33.759
-It was such a good day.
-I know, it was.

42:33.842 --> 42:35.803
We were hanging out, and I... I just...

42:35.886 --> 42:38.180
-Look, it's fine. We don't have to...
-I'm sorry. Okay.

42:38.264 --> 42:39.265
I'm not...

42:39.348 --> 42:42.309
I'm not trying to replace Mark.

42:43.185 --> 42:45.229
I can't do that. Um...

42:46.313 --> 42:48.107
But, uh... [inhales]

42:48.190 --> 42:50.526
I... I care about you.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.194
Um...

42:52.861 --> 42:54.071
A lot. And, uh...

42:54.530 --> 42:56.824
-I think we're a good team.
-I...

42:56.907 --> 42:59.827
Ju-- Before you say anything,
just understand that...

43:00.536 --> 43:02.162
nothing has to change. I'm...

43:03.789 --> 43:05.749
I mean, we're already
kind of like a family,

43:05.833 --> 43:07.960
and we can still be that, and we can be...

43:08.961 --> 43:10.004
We can be...

43:11.422 --> 43:12.506
anything.

43:12.590 --> 43:13.507
Anything you need.

43:15.217 --> 43:16.093
Okay.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.390
I need us to be friends.

43:29.440 --> 43:32.776
Um, is it... Is it Dion?
Did he say something?

43:32.860 --> 43:33.944
-No.
-I mean, I know...

43:34.028 --> 43:36.113
-I know he... he comes first, so...
-No, it's not Dion.

43:36.196 --> 43:38.782
It's not Dion and it's not timing,
it's just...

43:41.744 --> 43:43.037
It's just no.

43:47.041 --> 43:50.127
But, um, it doesn't mean
I-I don't adore you. I adore you.

43:50.210 --> 43:51.795
-Oh, no, no, I got it.
-Dion adores you.

43:51.879 --> 43:53.088
You don't have to, um...

43:53.714 --> 43:54.548
I'll be fine.

43:55.424 --> 43:56.759
Yeah, me and, uh...

43:58.093 --> 44:00.054
Me and rejection are old pals.

Where's Pat?

44:21.450 --> 44:22.910
[Nicole] Hey. What happened?

44:22.993 --> 44:24.370
[sobbing quietly]

44:29.249 --> 44:30.459
Hey, no, no, she...

44:31.293 --> 44:33.837
she will think about it,
and she's gonna change her mind.

44:35.130 --> 44:37.216
Not unless I can tell her what happened.

44:39.885 --> 44:40.969
And I can't do that.

45:39.778 --> 45:40.779
You got your watch?

45:40.863 --> 45:41.739
[Dion] Uh-huh.

45:41.822 --> 45:43.824
-Oh, I'm starving. Are you starving?
-[Dion] Yep.

45:43.907 --> 45:45.451
What do you wanna eat for dinner?

45:45.534 --> 45:48.162
Um... some chicken nuggets
with some barbecue sauce?

45:48.245 --> 45:50.706
Chicken nuggets
with some barbecue sauce? Okay.

45:50.789 --> 45:52.708
-And some French fries.
-Excuse me, Miss Warren?

45:53.292 --> 45:54.126

-Everyone back!
-Just step back, ma'am.

46:06.388 --> 46:09.016
-What's happening?
-Step away from the boy, ma'am.

46:09.099 --> 46:11.310
-My son? No, why?
-Mom?

46:11.393 --> 46:13.896
It's okay. Just be calm.
Don't do anything.

46:13.979 --> 46:17.232
The boy needs to come with us.
The CDC was alerted to his condition.

46:17.316 --> 46:19.443
Until we're sure
he poses no threat to the community,

46:19.526 --> 46:20.569
he needs to be quarantined.

46:20.652 --> 46:23.405
-Put a mask on him.
-[Nicole] No, no, he's fine. Hey!

46:23.489 --> 46:25.783
Hey, but look at him. He's... He's fine!
What are you...

46:25.866 --> 46:28.911
-Don't you see? He's... No!
-Mom! Mom!

46:28.994 --> 46:30.454
-No!
