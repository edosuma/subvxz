(doorbell rings)

00:56.867 --> 00:58.500
It's your cab.

00:58.567 --> 01:00.600
Have a wonderful time
at the wedding.

01:00.667 --> 01:02.767
Give Phil and the family my love.

01:02.834 --> 01:05.767
-I need your opinion on something.
-Yeah.

01:05.834 --> 01:08.633
What should I give Phil's daughter
for her wedding,

01:08.700 --> 01:10.233
your grandmother's lace tablecloth

01:10.300 --> 01:12.667
or 50 bucks towards
getting a neck?

01:13.734 --> 01:15.367
Give her the tablecloth.

01:16.567 --> 01:20.000
You're right. Her husband doesn't
care that she looks like Abe Vigoda.

01:20.066 --> 01:21.900
Why should I?

01:21.967 --> 01:24.000
See you in
a couple of weeks.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.700
With busy careers
and social lives,

01:28.767 --> 01:31.900
we really need
a full-time housekeeper.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.433
-Do you like our home?
-Lovely.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.533
Last place I was
had barred windows,

01:37.600 --> 01:39.066
walls, and guard dogs.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.233
Quite a security system.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.834
The best.
San Quentin.

01:46.633 --> 01:50.433
15 years I spent
in that stinking hole.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.834
I saw violence.
I saw despair.

01:53.900 --> 01:56.700
I saw Johnny Cash eight times.

01:58.233 --> 02:01.133
Well, I guess that concludes
the interview,

02:01.200 --> 02:02.567
unless there are questions.

02:02.633 --> 02:04.600
I have a question.

02:04.667 --> 02:07.100
Does Johnny Cash
ever wear plaid?

02:09.567 --> 02:11.600
It's not her fault.
She's from Minnesota.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.300
We'll be in touch.

02:15.667 --> 02:18.767
We have interviewed
dozens of people.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.133
We haven't met
one likely candidate.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.200
Maybe our standards
are too high.

02:23.266 --> 02:25.700
(doorbell rings)

02:27.633 --> 02:29.700
-May I help you?
-Yes.

02:29.767 --> 02:32.834
Does the mean-looking white woman
I just passed live here?

02:32.900 --> 02:34.567
No.

02:34.633 --> 02:37.600
I've come to apply for
the housekeeping position.

02:37.667 --> 02:40.433
-Please, please, come right in.
-Thank you.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.266
-I'm Marguerite Brown.
-I'm Dorothy.

02:43.333 --> 02:45.967
These are my roommates,
Blanche, Rose.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.900
Please, sit down.

02:48.967 --> 02:52.100
Why not begin by telling us
about yourself?

02:52.166 --> 02:54.400
There isn't much to tell.

02:54.467 --> 02:58.333
I'm hard-working and honest,
and I'll work for a reasonable wage.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.800
That's it?

03:01.834 --> 03:04.800
All right,
I won't go on with this charade.

03:04.867 --> 03:06.700
There is something else.

03:06.767 --> 03:08.133
I'm black.

03:10.533 --> 03:15.100
Now, if that's a problem for you,
I'm white.

03:15.166 --> 03:17.166
Of course,
that will cost you extra.

03:18.433 --> 03:20.567
I could kiss you.

03:20.633 --> 03:23.300
And I don't go
for that freaky stuff.

03:23.367 --> 03:25.700
Neither do Dorothy and I.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.333
(telephone rings)

03:33.400 --> 03:35.333
Excuse me.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.467
Hello?

03:36.533 --> 03:39.567
Norman, darling,
are we still on for tonight?

03:39.633 --> 03:41.433
But you said we...

03:41.900 --> 03:43.133
but you promised...

03:44.133 --> 03:44.867
I see.

03:44.934 --> 03:46.667
All right. Bye-bye.

03:47.533 --> 03:50.333
That's the second time
Norman's canceled.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.734
Maybe he's not interested.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.066
Not interested?
Don't be silly.

03:54.133 --> 03:57.867
I'm the most attractive woman
in all of Miami

03:57.934 --> 04:01.166
now that miss Donna Rice
has moved to Hollywood.

04:02.900 --> 04:07.100
Maybe I know a way
to get Norman's attention.

04:07.166 --> 04:09.967
If it involves silk sheets
and a parochial school outfit,

04:10.033 --> 04:11.834
I've already tried it.

04:13.367 --> 04:15.200
Here. Take this.

04:15.266 --> 04:18.100
It's worked for my grandmother
and my mother.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.900
Dab some behind your ears,

04:19.967 --> 04:22.066
and whomever you desire
will come to you.

04:22.133 --> 04:23.133
What is it?

04:23.200 --> 04:24.800
It's a gift.

04:24.867 --> 04:27.400
I don't need bribing.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.233
I want you to have the job.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.300
Fine with me.

04:31.367 --> 04:32.367
Can you start tomorrow?

04:32.433 --> 04:34.433
I'll be here bright and early.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.967
We'll see you then.

04:37.934 --> 04:40.200
You be sure and use that.

04:40.266 --> 04:41.533
-Yes, ma'am.
-Bye.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.633
Bye now.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.500
What an absolutely
charming woman!

04:45.567 --> 04:47.100
I wonder what this is?

04:47.166 --> 04:49.400
I'll bet it's a love potion.

04:49.467 --> 04:53.533
Rose, there's no such thing
as a love potion.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.367
Sure, there is, Dorothy.

04:55.433 --> 04:58.700
My grandparents met
because of a love potion.

04:58.767 --> 05:02.734
Actually, it was a foot salve
gramps accidentally swallowed.

05:04.266 --> 05:07.467
Grandma was the nurse
who pumped his stomach,

05:07.533 --> 05:08.600
but she was new,

05:08.667 --> 05:10.567
and she attached the nozzle
to the wrong place.

05:12.767 --> 05:14.867
Next thing you know,
they were engaged.

05:17.367 --> 05:19.533
I don't care what's in this.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.967
I'll do anything
to get Norman's attention.

05:22.033 --> 05:24.033
If you get Norman's attention,

05:24.100 --> 05:27.300
it won't be because
of what's in that bottle.

05:27.367 --> 05:31.166
But if it does,
I'll sell my mother for an ounce.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.734
Girls!

05:39.800 --> 05:42.367
Girls, look what I found
under my bed.

05:42.433 --> 05:45.266
Gee, that's the most colorful
dust ball I've ever seen.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.734
This is no dust ball, Rose.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.800
-What is it?
-It's a rock.

05:51.867 --> 05:54.166
I think it's a charm.

05:54.233 --> 05:55.834
It is.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.133
I learned it from my grandmother.

05:58.200 --> 06:02.066
You put a specially painted rock
beneath a person's bed

06:02.133 --> 06:04.033
to bring them a restful sleep.

06:04.100 --> 06:06.700
You put this under my bed?

06:06.767 --> 06:09.100
I was trying to be helpful.

06:09.166 --> 06:13.333
I figured with those terrible bags,
you needed the rest.

06:14.867 --> 06:17.233
Dorothy always looks like that.

06:19.400 --> 06:23.367
It'll take more than rest
to get rid of those.

06:23.867 --> 06:28.667
Why don't you all take turns
hitting me with a 2x4?

06:28.734 --> 06:32.633
I didn't mean
to cause any trouble.

06:33.133 --> 06:36.567
I think Marguerite's been inhaling
a little too much pine-sol.

06:37.934 --> 06:38.967
Wait a minute.

06:39.033 --> 06:42.166
Didn't you mention how
well you've been sleeping lately?

06:42.233 --> 06:44.734
You said you hadn't
slept so well in years.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.200
It has nothing to do
with this rock.

06:47.266 --> 06:49.967
I like Marguerite
as much as you do,

06:50.033 --> 06:53.600
but she's not doing
a very good job.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.834
She's doing a terrific job.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.600
Since she gave me that potion,

06:57.667 --> 06:59.967
Norman's been on me
like white on rice.

07:01.166 --> 07:04.367
I'm talking about house,
white on rice?

07:05.700 --> 07:08.100
Maybe she's a little lax.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.400
She's more than a little lax.

07:10.467 --> 07:14.233
She's habitually late,
she's broken a number of glasses,

07:14.300 --> 07:18.467
and she threw out <i>People</i> magazine
before I read it.

07:18.533 --> 07:21.200
But look at all the wonderful things
that have happened

07:21.266 --> 07:23.000
since Marguerite
started working here.

07:23.066 --> 07:28.100
Blanche is dating Norman,
you're sleeping better,

07:28.166 --> 07:31.200
and Sandy Duncan
is finally back on TV.

07:35.700 --> 07:38.333
We should talk with her.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.333
You know Sandy Duncan?

07:43.300 --> 07:45.500
Dorothy, look, Marguerite didn't
throw out <i>People.</i>

07:45.567 --> 07:47.100
Oh, good.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.867
-Morning, Rose.
-Hi, Dorothy.

08:01.934 --> 08:03.900
Rose, why are you
cleaning the kitchen?

08:03.967 --> 08:05.500
This is Marguerite's job.

08:05.567 --> 08:07.533
Dorothy, I know exactly
what you're gonna say,

08:07.600 --> 08:09.100
but I talked to Marguerite
on the phone.

08:09.166 --> 08:11.266
She has a really good
excuse for being late.

08:11.333 --> 08:12.967
Oh, fine, what is it?

08:13.467 --> 08:16.633
She had to go pluck a hair
from the chin of a dwarf.

08:23.967 --> 08:26.667
And you fell for that old excuse?

08:27.667 --> 08:29.467
Have either of you
seen Marguerite?

08:29.533 --> 08:31.867
-She's not here yet.
-I wish you'd look at this.

08:31.934 --> 08:34.700
She melted my buttons
with the iron.

08:34.767 --> 08:37.133
Now I'll never be able
to open my blouse again.

08:39.166 --> 08:42.000
It's a dark day
in the history of mankind.

08:43.567 --> 08:46.400
Maybe we'd better have another
one of our talks with Marguerite.

08:46.467 --> 08:48.266
I think we've had enough talks.

08:48.333 --> 08:50.400
It's time we did
something about this.

08:50.467 --> 08:53.133
Oh, Dorothy, you don't think
we ought to fire her?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.400
Look, Marguerite
is a lovely person.

08:55.467 --> 08:57.767
She just cannot do the job.

08:57.834 --> 09:01.066
I hate to admit it,
but you're right.

09:01.133 --> 09:04.300
We had a similar situation
back in St. Olaf

09:04.367 --> 09:07.066
with Mrs. Gunderson,
our grade school teacher.

09:07.133 --> 09:09.967
Oh, she was the nicest woman
you'd ever want to meet,

09:10.033 --> 09:14.767
but as the years went by,
she got her facts a little confused.

09:14.834 --> 09:17.166
In biology class,
she started telling kids

09:17.233 --> 09:21.200
that the human body was made up
of 80 percent Ovaltine.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.200
While we were studying
World War I,

09:24.266 --> 09:26.633
she told us mustard gas
was something you got

09:26.700 --> 09:28.800
from eating too many hot dogs.

09:31.667 --> 09:33.934
That's why to this day
in St. Olaf,

09:34.000 --> 09:35.867
everyone celebrates
the fourth of July

09:35.934 --> 09:37.800
with a thin omelet on a bun.

09:40.266 --> 09:42.567
What do you say,
after we fire Marguerite,

09:42.633 --> 09:45.433
we each chip in
and get Rose a cat scan?

09:49.300 --> 09:51.600
Rose,
is there a point to your story?

09:51.667 --> 09:53.934
Well, of course,
there's a point to it.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.467
Mrs. Gunderson was a really
sweet woman,

09:56.533 --> 09:58.600
but she just couldn't
do the job anymore.

09:58.667 --> 10:01.467
Then it's settled.
We fire Marguerite.

10:01.533 --> 10:03.000
Couldn't we wait
just a few more days?

10:03.066 --> 10:05.633
I think Norman's finally gonna
invite me to the premiere

10:05.700 --> 10:10.166
of <i>Give them hell, Harry,</i> starring
Mr. Father Mulcahy from mash.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.200
What does that have to do
with Marguerite?

10:14.266 --> 10:17.033
Well, it was her potion
that brought us together.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.700
Blanche, you still think
that Marguerite

10:18.767 --> 10:20.900
has some kind
of mystical powers?

10:20.967 --> 10:22.467
(sighs)

10:22.533 --> 10:25.000
All right.
I guess I'm just being silly.

10:25.066 --> 10:26.767
Okay, go ahead
and fire her, Dorothy.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.200
Why should I be the one
to fire her?

10:29.266 --> 10:30.900
You're the meanest.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.100
Blanche, that's not true.

10:36.166 --> 10:38.166
Dorothy just looks the meanest.

10:41.033 --> 10:43.967
We hired Marguerite together,
we fire her together.

10:44.033 --> 10:45.066
Thank you, Rose.

10:45.133 --> 10:47.433
And by the way,
you look the dumbest.

10:52.166 --> 10:54.467
Morning, everyone.

10:54.533 --> 10:57.633
Oh, Marguerite,
I feel so terrible.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.266
What's the matter with her?

11:01.333 --> 11:02.900
A bit upset.

11:02.967 --> 11:06.734
She just found out that Gene Shalit
wants his hair to look that way.

11:09.100 --> 11:12.533
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to get special herbs.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.133
I'm throwing together another little
aphrodisiac for Blanche.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.200
I'd better get to work.

11:19.266 --> 11:20.633
We can't fire her now.

11:20.700 --> 11:23.166
She's making me an aphrodisiac.

11:23.667 --> 11:27.433
Use vodka and black underwear
like everyone else.

11:30.600 --> 11:34.567
Can we get this over
before I lose my nerve?

11:34.633 --> 11:38.166
Marguerite, we have to talk to you.

11:38.233 --> 11:40.066
But before we do,

11:40.133 --> 11:42.767
Tootie is my favorite
on <i>The Facts of Life.</i>

11:47.633 --> 11:49.300
You're firing me, aren't you?

11:49.367 --> 11:54.200
Marguerite, we think
very highly of you as a person,

11:54.266 --> 11:56.767
but we're going
to have to let you go.

11:56.834 --> 11:59.734
We don't feel
you're right for this job.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.900
You did when you hired me.

12:01.967 --> 12:04.333
Marguerite, you're fired.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.066
Rose, we just did that part, honey.

12:08.100 --> 12:11.000
Sorry. I'm not very good
at this sort of thing.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.867
We'll pay you for the rest
of the week.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.600
Oh, Marguerite,
I hope you understand.

12:16.667 --> 12:19.567
I've never been
fired from any job.

12:19.633 --> 12:21.700
We're really awfully sorry.

12:21.767 --> 12:23.967
Well, you should be,

12:24.033 --> 12:28.734
because I think
you're making a very big mistake.

12:35.633 --> 12:37.800
She seemed pretty upset.

12:37.867 --> 12:39.300
We just fired her.

12:39.367 --> 12:42.400
What did she mean
about a big mistake?

12:42.467 --> 12:46.033
She meant she's unhappy
that she lost her job.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.800
(explosion)

12:47.867 --> 12:50.734
Or that she's going
to blow up our kitchen.

13:13.266 --> 13:14.900
Nice hit, Tracy.

13:14.967 --> 13:18.567
Throw one into
the Schillers' yard.

13:18.633 --> 13:21.533
This is the worst day of my life.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.133
Honey, what happened?

13:23.200 --> 13:27.867
First, my alarm didn't go off,
then I had a flat tire,

13:27.934 --> 13:31.100
then I smashed
my hand in a door.

13:31.166 --> 13:33.500
I feel like crawling
under the covers

13:33.567 --> 13:36.166
and eating Velveeta
right out of the box.

13:42.200 --> 13:45.533
B.B. King does that when
he's tired of singing the blues.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.667
Honey, sit down.
I'll give you some nice lemonade.

13:49.734 --> 13:51.200
Thanks, Dorothy.

13:57.100 --> 14:00.000
Something weird is going
on around here, Dorothy.

14:00.066 --> 14:03.033
You're just having
a little bad luck.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.400
Do you really think
that's all it is?

14:18.834 --> 14:21.100
Of course.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.533
Well, maybe you're right.
Need any help?

14:24.600 --> 14:26.133
Get away from me,
you jinx.

14:28.033 --> 14:31.266
I mean,
no, thank you, Rose.

14:31.767 --> 14:33.934
Girls, you'll never
guess what happened.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.333
Norman threw me over
for a fat woman.

14:37.533 --> 14:39.633
Oh, Blanche,
I'm sorry.

14:39.700 --> 14:42.767
Dorothy should be sorry.
It's all her fault.

14:42.834 --> 14:43.934
Why?

14:44.000 --> 14:47.233
Marguerite has
put a curse on us.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.233
Come on, you're just upset.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.433
You're talking nonsense.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.633
It makes perfect sense to me.

14:53.700 --> 14:55.300
I rest my case.

14:56.467 --> 14:59.700
You have to admit
terrible things have happened

14:59.767 --> 15:01.266
since we fired Marguerite.

15:01.333 --> 15:04.767
Our plumbing went bad,
the refrigerator broke down,

15:04.834 --> 15:08.567
we've all had car trouble,
you haven't slept a wink,

15:08.633 --> 15:12.066
and now Blanche's boyfriend
has dumped her for a porker.

15:17.767 --> 15:20.767
Marguerite said firing her
was a big mistake,

15:20.834 --> 15:23.333
-and she was right.
-I'm not listening to this.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.300
You'd better listen.
We're in trouble.

15:26.367 --> 15:27.333
What should we do?

15:27.400 --> 15:30.700
We should get Marguerite
to take off the curse.

15:30.767 --> 15:34.300
Let's ask her
if she wants her job back.

15:34.367 --> 15:38.066
I'll go call her right now.
Wait a minute.

15:38.133 --> 15:40.367
Nobody is calling anybody.

15:40.433 --> 15:44.367
This whole thing has gotten
way out of hand.

15:44.433 --> 15:47.066
There is no such thing
as a curse.

15:47.133 --> 15:49.700
All right,
we've had a little bad luck.

15:49.767 --> 15:52.400
But, ladies, that's life.

15:52.467 --> 15:53.700
When you look at it,

15:53.767 --> 15:57.633
has anything that out of
the ordinary really happened?

16:10.934 --> 16:12.867
This isn't the orange bowl, is it?

16:24.500 --> 16:27.700
Gee, I hope Marguerite
likes champagne.

16:27.767 --> 16:30.834
Champagne. Don't you think
we're going overboard?

16:30.900 --> 16:32.633
Remember the crow man.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.734
Do we have caviar to go
with the champagne?

16:35.800 --> 16:37.400
(doorbell rings)

16:37.467 --> 16:40.200
Oh, that must be...
oh, girls, I'm scared.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.567
Breathe deep and relax.

16:42.633 --> 16:44.867
There's nothing to be scared of.

16:44.934 --> 16:46.300
Dorothy, get the door.

16:47.567 --> 16:48.467
Go on.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.033
Marguerite,
how lovely to see you again.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.600
Please come in.

16:57.667 --> 16:58.667
Hello, ladies.

16:58.734 --> 17:00.500
Welcome back, Marguerite.

17:00.567 --> 17:03.000
Sit down
and make yourself comfortable.

17:03.066 --> 17:05.800
I was a little bit surprised

17:05.867 --> 17:08.300
when you called
to give back my job.

17:08.367 --> 17:09.867
I wanted to explain--

17:09.934 --> 17:13.600
It was all a silly mistake.
Champagne?

17:13.667 --> 17:17.734
-Thank you. Ladies--
-These are for you.

17:17.800 --> 17:23.066
Ladies, this is all very nice,
but there's something I must say.

17:23.133 --> 17:24.066
When you fired me--

17:24.133 --> 17:26.400
Oh, you don't have
to go into that.

17:26.467 --> 17:28.834
Here.
A little gift from us to you.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.100
Well... well, isn't that nice?

17:35.734 --> 17:37.500
A tiara?

17:39.934 --> 17:43.100
Well, you said to get something
I'd buy for myself.

17:46.300 --> 17:49.166
You see,
I've always wanted a tiara

17:49.233 --> 17:52.200
since I was a little girl
in St. Olaf.

17:52.266 --> 17:55.233
Every year, I'd blow out
my birthday candles

17:55.300 --> 17:57.600
and wish for one, and every year,

17:57.667 --> 18:00.333
I'd get a freshly carved pair
of wooden shoes.

18:01.600 --> 18:06.000
One year, during the depression,
I just got a block of coal.

18:06.066 --> 18:08.633
I carved it into a pair
of high-topped Keds.

18:10.734 --> 18:13.834
Do anything you want to her.
Just don't hurt us.

18:15.233 --> 18:18.300
Marguerite,
let me put this on for you.

18:18.367 --> 18:21.166
Oh, my, you look stunning.

18:21.233 --> 18:23.500
Doesn't she just look stunning?

18:23.567 --> 18:26.200
Sophia,
what are you doing here?

18:26.266 --> 18:28.100
I live here, remember?

18:33.700 --> 18:36.033
What is this,
the miss black America contest?

18:38.800 --> 18:40.967
Marguerite,
I'd like you to meet my mother,

18:41.033 --> 18:42.967
Sophia Petrillo.

18:43.033 --> 18:45.133
Ma, this is Marguerite.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.100
Pleased to meet you.

18:47.166 --> 18:48.633
Won't you join us?

18:48.700 --> 18:51.233
Yeah, and pour me
some of that champagne.

18:51.300 --> 18:53.533
I never know
if I'll make it to new year's.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.033
What are we celebrating?
Are the Supremes back together?

18:59.500 --> 19:02.233
Ma, I think you
should go lie down.

19:02.300 --> 19:03.500
You look exhausted.

19:03.567 --> 19:06.066
Hey, I'm 80.
I always look like this.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.200
Marguerite,
what's your claim to fame?

19:09.266 --> 19:10.800
I'm the housekeeper.

19:13.133 --> 19:14.300
Yeah?

19:14.367 --> 19:16.467
You always wear a tiara
to clean the toilet?

19:17.667 --> 19:20.834
Ma, could I see you
in the kitchen?

19:20.900 --> 19:22.734
Hey, take it easy.
I'm not gumby.

19:25.533 --> 19:26.367
What's going on?

19:26.433 --> 19:30.300
Ma, be especially
nice to Marguerite.

19:30.367 --> 19:32.433
Please,
I wasn't brought up in a cave.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.633
Actually,
I was brought up in a cave.

19:36.700 --> 19:41.133
Listen, ma, I am serious.
Don't ask her to lift a finger.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.433
If you need anything,
let me or one of the girls know.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.066
Wait a minute.

19:46.133 --> 19:47.834
-She's the housekeeper, right?
-Right.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.700
But she doesn't lift a finger,
right?

19:49.767 --> 19:52.500
-Right.
-You take care of everything, right?

19:52.567 --> 19:54.500
-Right.
-Where are you going, ma?

19:54.567 --> 19:56.367
To get a job as a housekeeper.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.567
Ma, be serious now.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.867
Marguerite is dangerous.

20:02.934 --> 20:04.934
She put a curse on us.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.700
And I'm the one
that got put in the home?

20:09.600 --> 20:12.600
I know it's unbelievable,
but we fired her,

20:12.667 --> 20:15.300
she put a curse on us,
so we hired her back.

20:15.367 --> 20:18.867
We're trying to keep her happy.

20:18.934 --> 20:20.800
You're afraid of her.

20:20.867 --> 20:24.533
It's unbelievable,
but please go along with it.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.667
Do it for me.

20:27.166 --> 20:29.700
If it means that much, you got it.

20:29.767 --> 20:30.600
Oh, thanks.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.800
Now remember, not a word.

20:37.834 --> 20:38.834
What's all this crap

20:38.900 --> 20:40.867
about you putting
a curse on my daughter?

20:43.133 --> 20:44.100
Sophia.

20:44.166 --> 20:47.000
We'll all be turned
into kumquats.

20:48.300 --> 20:51.333
-What is she talking about?
-Don't play dumb with me.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.367
I can cast curses myself.

20:53.433 --> 20:56.900
Do you think Shelley Long
was really tired of doing <i>Cheers?</i>

20:57.800 --> 21:00.800
Wrong, baby.
I was tired of her.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.500
Is that it?

21:08.567 --> 21:10.433
You think I put a curse on you?

21:10.500 --> 21:13.066
You got mad at us for firing you,

21:13.133 --> 21:15.834
so you reversed
my love potion.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.800
Honey, that wasn't love potion.

21:18.867 --> 21:21.333
That was Chanel no. 5.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.300
I'm not buying that.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.834
Dorothy uses Chanel
no. 5 all the time,

21:26.900 --> 21:28.500
and she never attracts men.

21:33.867 --> 21:37.333
What about this painted rock
that you put under my bed?

21:37.400 --> 21:39.900
Oh, thank God you found it.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.900
This is very special.

21:42.967 --> 21:45.166
It was the first wage
I ever earned.

21:45.233 --> 21:47.200
They paid you in rocks?

21:47.266 --> 21:49.133
Hey, don't knock it.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.100
Today in Sardinia,

21:51.166 --> 21:53.467
two of these will get you
a veal and pepper sandwich.

21:55.867 --> 21:59.567
Then you lied to me
about its helping me to sleep.

22:00.633 --> 22:03.066
I figured you'd be angry

22:03.133 --> 22:05.100
because I didn't
sweep under the bed.

22:05.166 --> 22:07.700
Gee, you're really a good liar.

22:09.233 --> 22:12.867
I know. That's why
I'm studying to be a lawyer.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.467
I'm going to school at night,

22:19.533 --> 22:23.233
and the only time I have to study
is when you all leave.

22:23.300 --> 22:27.467
That's why the toilets
don't get proper attention.

22:27.533 --> 22:29.867
Then everything
was a misunderstanding.

22:29.934 --> 22:32.667
Norman really did dump me
for a fat woman.

22:34.533 --> 22:36.233
No kidding. Fatter than you?

22:39.133 --> 22:43.166
I hate to burst your bubble,
but I just wanted a job.

22:43.233 --> 22:45.934
I don't have magical powers.

22:46.433 --> 22:49.166
Boy, have I been stupid!

22:50.633 --> 22:52.900
I haven't felt this dumb
since I found out

22:52.967 --> 22:55.066
William Conrad
wasn't one guy in a jacket

22:55.133 --> 22:57.700
and another guy in pants.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.333
Well, Marguerite,

23:05.400 --> 23:09.800
I guess we just let our
superstitions get the best of us.

23:09.867 --> 23:11.467
We owe you an apology.

23:11.533 --> 23:14.400
No, no.
I owe you an apology.

23:14.467 --> 23:17.300
You're right.
I'm a lousy housekeeper.

23:17.367 --> 23:19.834
I feel like such a silly goose.

23:22.433 --> 23:23.734
Goodbye, ladies.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.867
I'm sorry for all the trouble,

23:25.934 --> 23:28.500
but thank you
for being understanding.

23:28.567 --> 23:31.834
And thank you for taking care
of that Shelley Long.

23:31.900 --> 23:34.934
I'm tired of that thin,
uppity white woman too.

23:42.300 --> 23:43.800
Well, that's that.

23:43.867 --> 23:45.800
Anything else
you need straightened out?

23:45.867 --> 23:49.066
No, ma.
Tell me, how was the wedding?

23:49.567 --> 23:50.800
Beautiful.

23:51.767 --> 23:54.133
Until the bride lifted her veil.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.934
I shudder to think
what was under that dress.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.834
(theme music playing)
