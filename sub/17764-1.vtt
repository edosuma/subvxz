WEBVTT

01:49.266 --> 01:50.825
7 minutes late.

01:53.451 --> 01:55.810
Heavy on the foot, Frankie.

01:57.670 --> 01:59.636
We didn't figure on any rain.

02:24.607 --> 02:26.554
6 packages of gum.

02:26.845 --> 02:28.422
That ought to be enough.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.998
Why doesn't this stinking rain stop?

02:50.987 --> 02:53.751
Maybe they forgot about
this soup back here.

03:02.039 --> 03:04.607
Frankie, slow it down...

03:07.927 --> 03:10.517
If they ever hit a bump,
we're all angels.

03:24.022 --> 03:26.707
If the wires get wet,
maybe it won't spark.

03:27.953 --> 03:30.270
Boy, that little guy sure is scared.

03:40.707 --> 03:42.925
Picked up two minutes.

03:43.045 --> 03:44.929
It's going to work.

10:49.301 --> 10:50.469
Honk at them.

10:58.948 --> 10:59.960
Let's go!

13:48.054 --> 13:50.538
Before we start congratulating
ourselves, let's remember...

13:50.658 --> 13:52.926
...we've still got 900 miles to go.

13:55.337 --> 13:58.869
900 miles, through every cop
between here and the coast...

13:59.704 --> 14:02.580
...and you laugh it up
like a couple of clowns.

14:04.038 --> 14:05.648
Okay...okay.

14:25.767 --> 14:27.536
We're coming into Montello.

14:34.595 --> 14:35.645
Montello.

15:01.264 --> 15:03.231
Now leaving the fair city of Montello.

15:03.352 --> 15:05.718
We've got 35 minutes to make Wendover.

16:17.058 --> 16:19.157
Now let's go. We've got 4 hours.

18:42.336 --> 18:43.502
Now, remember.

18:43.891 --> 18:46.336
Stay on the main highway no matter what.

18:46.456 --> 18:48.440
No shortcuts, no back roads.

18:49.140 --> 18:51.664
Our best cover is to move right
along with the rest of the traffic.

18:51.784 --> 18:54.450
<i>2TR-70, 2TR-70, come in.</i>

18:54.731 --> 18:56.719
Shut that thing off, will you?

18:57.866 --> 19:01.222
Use that police wavelength only when
you're absolutely in the clear.

19:01.343 --> 19:03.925
Otherwise, keep your radios set at 1600.

19:05.786 --> 19:10.430
We leave here at 30-minute intervals.
Gas up at Baker, Alamo, and Redlands.

19:11.926 --> 19:14.609
Stop to eat every 8 hours.
Just sandwiches.

19:16.477 --> 19:18.460
Change drivers every 4 hours.

19:19.160 --> 19:22.269
And never go over 10 miles
beyond the speed limit.

19:24.334 --> 19:26.454
If the cops search your truck...

19:27.367 --> 19:29.077
...keep talking to them.

19:34.293 --> 19:35.526
It's 7:30.

19:39.161 --> 19:40.544
Alright, let's go.

21:31.780 --> 21:33.471
<i>2TR-70, roger.</i>

21:33.591 --> 21:36.444
Over 100 miles out and
not even a whisper yet.

21:37.145 --> 21:38.683
That Eddie's a genius, huh?

21:38.802 --> 21:41.228
That's a college education for you.

21:41.348 --> 21:43.347
You know, it's his first job.

21:43.891 --> 21:46.248
When Frankie told me,
I thought he was nuts.

21:46.368 --> 21:48.268
I wasn't hooking up with an amateur.

21:49.929 --> 21:51.232
A job like that.

21:52.029 --> 21:53.583
That's no amateur.

21:53.704 --> 21:55.916
Too bad my wife couldn't hold out.

21:56.966 --> 21:59.601
She waited for me for 23 years
while I'm in and out of stir...

21:59.721 --> 22:01.918
...like it was a revolving door.

22:02.870 --> 22:04.560
2 months ago, she dies.

22:06.256 --> 22:07.286
Well...

22:07.406 --> 22:09.598
I got a boy back east.

22:09.718 --> 22:11.910
Nothing but the best
for him from now on out.

22:13.018 --> 22:15.663
He's going to the biggest
and best college in Rio.

22:16.497 --> 22:17.469
Rio?

22:17.838 --> 22:21.894
<i>1-Sam-42 or 1-Sam-46, come in.</i>

22:22.014 --> 22:23.624
<i>4-L-21, no want.</i>

22:32.094 --> 22:33.687
Let me tell you about Rio.

22:33.807 --> 22:37.225
In the first place, there's over a
million and a half people down there.

22:37.345 --> 22:40.840
Let's face it: you can get lost
in a town that size, right?

22:42.059 --> 22:44.378
Me and the kid'll take a boat,
and by the time we get there...

22:44.498 --> 22:46.758
...everything will have cooled off.

22:47.440 --> 22:50.705
Then I'll get Harold (that's my kid)...

22:50.825 --> 22:53.397
...I'll get Harold one
of those sports jobs.

22:53.519 --> 22:55.983
They got a lot of beautiful
streets down there.

22:56.273 --> 22:59.670
And get this: they don't use
cement on the sidewalks.

22:59.789 --> 23:03.324
They got millions of little squares,
all painted different colors, and...

23:03.444 --> 23:07.261
They call them, uh,
mosaics. Yeah, that's it.

23:08.182 --> 23:10.454
And they've got a lot of hills,
where you can buy a house...

23:10.575 --> 23:12.604
...and nobody knows anything about it.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.897
And every day you can
drive down to the bay...

23:15.017 --> 23:17.659
...and the beach of
Copaca-- Copacabana.

23:18.795 --> 23:21.787
They've got the whitest
sands in the world there.

23:21.907 --> 23:26.375
White sand...blue sea...plenty
of room to move around.

23:27.586 --> 23:29.101
That's the place, I'm telling you.

23:29.221 --> 23:30.850
You've been there, huh?

23:31.530 --> 23:32.502
No.

23:59.093 --> 24:01.212
<i>- We hope you have enjoyed our...
- Alright, Willy.</i>

24:01.503 --> 24:03.505
<i>- And now stay tuned for John Oliver...
- Let's go.</i>

24:03.625 --> 24:05.970
<i>- ...and the news, which
follows immediately.</i>

24:06.089 --> 24:08.265
<i>John Oliver, with the 8 a.m. news.</i>

24:08.751 --> 24:11.477
<i>... tops the news today.</i>

24:11.598 --> 24:14.027
<i>In the most daring train
robbery of all time...</i>

24:18.849 --> 24:22.149
<i>At approximately 4 a.m. this morning,
an unknown number of men dressed in...</i>

24:22.269 --> 24:25.825
<i>...plastic coveralls, and with ghostly
white stockings covering their faces...</i>

24:25.945 --> 24:28.815
<i>...stopped and looted a special train,
carrying over 10 million dollars in...</i>

24:28.935 --> 24:31.342
<i>...gold to the San Francisco depository.</i>

24:35.893 --> 24:38.454
<i>Discovery of the robbery and
broadcasting of the alarm was...</i>

24:38.574 --> 24:41.276
<i>...delayed because of the remote
locale of the train hold-up...</i>

24:49.434 --> 24:52.950
<i>...[unintelligible] in the area during
the night and early morning hours.</i>

24:55.327 --> 24:57.640
<i>Police, who have issued
a 10-state alarm...</i>

24:57.760 --> 25:00.357
<i>...described it as the biggest train
robbery in American history...</i>

25:00.478 --> 25:03.900
<i>...and by the apparent speed with which
it was executed, the best-planned.</i>

25:04.020 --> 25:06.400
<i>The men were dressed in plastic
coveralls and with ghos--</i>

25:07.079 --> 25:09.081
<i>12-L-1 to the station...</i>

25:09.722 --> 25:11.310
What, are you crazy or something?

25:12.027 --> 25:13.834
Don't worry about
anything that's behind us.

25:13.954 --> 25:16.054
<i>And now, back to the local news.</i>

25:16.175 --> 25:20.183
<i>The nation was saddened today by
the news from Pensacola, Florida...</i>

25:35.402 --> 25:37.312
You know, 48's not too old.

25:38.129 --> 25:40.252
You know, I think I'll
get married again.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.907
<i>Uh, 418-99, stand by for the correction.</i>

25:44.687 --> 25:45.913
<i>13-A...</i>

25:46.033 --> 25:47.686
I want to meet one of those young ones.

25:47.806 --> 25:50.159
I mean, you know, one that's
had a little experience.

25:50.279 --> 25:52.224
Oh, you know, say, about 30?

25:54.456 --> 25:56.950
Hey, with you doing all them
stunts in the movies...

25:57.070 --> 25:59.461
...you must have married a
swell-looking girl, huh?

25:59.581 --> 26:00.726
I never was married.

26:00.847 --> 26:02.518
Huh! No kidding.

26:02.639 --> 26:04.042
- You never was?
- No.

26:04.162 --> 26:05.816
Huh. How come?

26:07.315 --> 26:08.190
I don't know.

26:42.430 --> 26:44.750
- Say, Frankie...
- Yeah?

26:44.870 --> 26:47.067
How many races you driven in, hmm?

26:47.923 --> 26:48.897
50?

26:49.793 --> 26:50.767
Yeah.

26:52.325 --> 26:55.150
I've always been fascinated
with auto racing.

26:55.714 --> 26:58.167
You must have started pretty young.

26:58.287 --> 26:59.337
Yeah.

27:00.213 --> 27:01.291
Only 16.

27:02.247 --> 27:04.312
The officials didn't know that, though.

27:04.432 --> 27:07.252
In Jersey you have to
be 18, even for midgets.

27:07.372 --> 27:09.804
It was always big cars for me, though.

27:10.544 --> 27:14.163
I even talked a guy into letting
me test his methanol special.

27:14.283 --> 27:15.643
Oh, man.

27:15.763 --> 27:19.265
You should have seen those other punks
on that track choke in my exhaust.

27:19.385 --> 27:22.022
102.7 [mph] average, 5 laps.

27:22.143 --> 27:23.581
102.7, huh?

27:24.653 --> 27:26.250
Sounds good enough for Indianapolis.

27:26.562 --> 27:27.554
Nah...

27:27.674 --> 27:30.690
That wouldn't even get you
to the preliminaries up there.

27:30.810 --> 27:34.450
3 years ago I had to make
139.2, just to qualify.

27:36.178 --> 27:38.087
I could have won that year.

27:38.457 --> 27:40.229
Those crummy officials.

27:40.657 --> 27:42.392
You jumped the yellow light, didn't you?

27:42.513 --> 27:44.536
That crack-up was almost
into the infield.

27:44.656 --> 27:47.380
I didn't even think they were
going to flash the yellow.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.036
So instead of holding position...

27:49.157 --> 27:52.542
...I figured it'd be best if
I got past the wreck, fast.

27:53.037 --> 27:54.887
And they bar me for life.

27:57.185 --> 28:01.509
Well, if they hadn't, I wouldn't have
the best wheel man in the business...

28:02.406 --> 28:04.820
...and you wouldn't be a millionaire.

28:06.210 --> 28:07.279
Yeah.

28:10.221 --> 28:13.201
Are the crane truck and
the van taken care of?

28:13.321 --> 28:14.351
Oh, yeah.

28:14.962 --> 28:15.917
Yeah.

28:16.037 --> 28:18.507
That's a good spot. The trees are
so thick you can't even see them.

28:18.627 --> 28:22.344
Alright, it's 8:30. You warm up
the truck, I'll open the doors.

28:22.636 --> 28:24.388
Ah, it's 8:30 already, huh?

28:27.853 --> 28:28.887
Frankie...

28:30.347 --> 28:31.341
The truck.

28:59.084 --> 29:00.312
You okay?

29:00.818 --> 29:02.318
Sure. Sure, I'm okay.

29:06.654 --> 29:08.114
Alright, let's go.

29:16.744 --> 29:20.795
<i>We now take you to Salt Lake City,
where KCBO correspondent John Oliver...</i>

29:20.915 --> 29:24.009
<i>...is covering the most
amazing robbery of all time.</i>

29:24.129 --> 29:26.756
<i>Here is a special bulletin
on the gold train robbery:</i>

29:26.878 --> 29:30.242
<i>Police are asking all citizens to
be on the lookout for 2 vehicles...</i>

29:30.362 --> 29:33.089
<i>...one a large moving van,
the other a crane truck...</i>

29:33.209 --> 29:36.905
<i>...reported to be the vehicles
used by the ghost-faced bandits.</i>

29:41.022 --> 29:43.867
<i>Anyone seeing vehicles of this
description traveling in company...</i>

29:43.988 --> 29:47.449
<i>...or forked together, please
notify your local police at once.</i>

29:48.521 --> 29:54.830
<i>Unit 7. Trucks investigated. Not wanted
vehicles. Return to station. KLK out.</i>

29:55.920 --> 29:58.708
<i>Alright, roger. Stand by.</i>

30:12.188 --> 30:14.407
- What's the trouble, officer?
- Oh, it's just routine.

30:14.528 --> 30:16.862
- What are you carrying?
- Furniture.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.986
- My own.
- Let's take a look.

30:26.535 --> 30:30.195
- So you like gum?
- Well, they say it keeps you from smoking.

30:31.033 --> 30:32.403
How long you been on the road?

30:32.404 --> 30:35.057
Let's see, left Salt Lake
about 8 hours ago.

30:35.498 --> 30:37.451
8 hours from Salt Lake.
You're really moving.

30:37.572 --> 30:39.711
Hey, Tom, come up here a minute!

30:53.451 --> 30:54.601
Hey, uh...

30:54.721 --> 30:55.653
Hey...

30:55.773 --> 30:58.280
Would you kinda take it careful, fellas?

30:58.401 --> 31:02.274
If I get so much as a scratch on
that stuff, my wife will kill me!

31:02.394 --> 31:04.378
Well, you know how women are.

31:05.626 --> 31:07.017
You're okay, buddy.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.496
- Take it easy, pal.
- Yeah, you too.

31:20.616 --> 31:23.072
Hey, does that gum-chewing really
help cut down your smoking?

31:23.192 --> 31:26.273
Oh, I don't smoke. I just want
to make sure I don't start.

31:26.393 --> 31:27.654
<i>12-33, stand by.</i>

31:29.603 --> 31:31.452
<i>13-A-43, clear.</i>

31:32.797 --> 31:34.414
<i>TSI-11, clear...</i>

31:36.031 --> 31:38.358
Hey, wait a minute. Hold on there! Halt!

31:38.805 --> 31:39.837
Hold up there!

31:48.031 --> 31:48.985
Halt!

31:50.172 --> 31:51.147
Halt!

31:52.198 --> 31:53.154
Halt!

32:17.227 --> 32:18.527
<i>TL-75, stand by.</i>

32:20.124 --> 32:22.112
Why don't they say something?

32:24.118 --> 32:26.435
What do you want to hear, your name?

32:26.921 --> 32:28.772
No. You know what I mean.

32:29.229 --> 32:33.748
Nothing about those guards knocked out
by the gas, or the two guys we slugged.

32:34.681 --> 32:37.114
They weren't hit too hard, were they?

32:38.945 --> 32:42.743
How do you suppose the police know
about the trucks and the mask?

32:43.503 --> 32:45.739
Yeah, but things happen sometimes.

32:45.859 --> 32:50.568
<i>609, can you handle the call?
No traffic unit available.</i>

32:51.421 --> 32:52.785
<i>CM...[Click.]</i>

32:53.856 --> 32:55.336
I know one thing...

32:55.921 --> 32:59.231
I'll be glad when we get past
one of these roadblocks.

33:04.193 --> 33:05.460
This is it.

33:06.354 --> 33:10.582
With that look on your face, you might
as well tell them the whole story.

33:24.551 --> 33:26.342
You won't get this service every day.

33:26.463 --> 33:29.314
- That's okay. We'll sit.
- Sorry, buddy. Everybody out.

33:29.434 --> 33:31.829
- Let's check the seal.
- Yeah, yeah.

33:45.032 --> 33:46.627
What's all that for?

33:46.747 --> 33:48.613
I just follow orders, fella.

33:53.250 --> 33:56.442
That guy looks like he's
trying to make his own road.

33:56.806 --> 33:58.871
A fella could get hurt that way.

33:58.991 --> 34:00.799
- Okay, Dave?
- All secure.

34:01.266 --> 34:03.634
- What happened to him?
- He got hurt.

34:04.668 --> 34:05.622
You're okay.

34:05.642 --> 34:07.653
Say, um, I've been having
a little engine trouble.

34:07.764 --> 34:10.078
Would it goof anything if I
pulled over and had a look at it?

34:10.197 --> 34:11.871
Pull over there. About 25, 30 yards.

34:11.991 --> 34:13.175
Thanks a lot.

35:16.709 --> 35:17.878
Let's move.

35:46.661 --> 35:48.864
So, they give me 10 lousy years.

35:49.802 --> 35:51.711
Good behavior, I'm out in 6.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.556
That's where I read all about Rio.

35:54.676 --> 35:55.840
No kidding.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.335
You ought to come down there with us.

35:59.891 --> 36:02.033
<i>We take you now to John Oliver
in Salt Lake City...</i>

36:02.154 --> 36:04.461
<i>...for further news on
the gold train robbery.</i>

36:04.582 --> 36:07.286
<i>The first break in the fabulous gold
robbery occurred about an hour and...</i>

36:07.406 --> 36:09.933
<i>a half ago, when a part
of the $10 million...</i>

36:10.053 --> 36:11.665
Watch it! Watch it!

36:14.230 --> 36:16.640
<i>One of the bandits was shot and
killed while attempting to run...</i>

36:16.760 --> 36:19.540
<i>- ...through a police roadblock.
- What's the matter?  You deaf?</i>

36:19.661 --> 36:21.435
I wonder how they found that out.

36:21.455 --> 36:22.803
You suppose they know
which way we're heading?

36:22.838 --> 36:25.130
Well, if you'll clam up for a
while, maybe we'll find out!

36:25.250 --> 36:29.121
<i>The claimed man was tentatively
identified as Roland "Rolly" Adams.</i>

36:29.241 --> 36:32.125
<i>Police have intensified their search
for the apparently abandoned van...</i>

36:32.245 --> 36:33.878
<i>...and crane truck...[Click.]</i>

36:35.369 --> 36:37.415
I wonder how they found Rolly.

36:38.196 --> 36:42.092
No wonder you got set up so many
times. You think cops are dumb!

36:43.652 --> 36:44.733
Skeets?

36:44.734 --> 36:47.345
Look, just relax, will you?
Keep your eyes on the road.

36:47.443 --> 36:49.267
Maybe we should pull
over and wait for Eddie.

36:49.387 --> 36:51.551
Maybe he'll want to change the plans.

36:51.672 --> 36:54.278
Maybe you'll keep quiet
for a while, huh?

37:00.105 --> 37:03.081
<i>A huge dragnet for the white stocking-
faced bandits has now spread...</i>

37:03.202 --> 37:06.452
<i>...to 23 states, with still no trace of
the truck believed to be carrying...</i>

37:06.572 --> 37:09.356
<i>...the remainder of
the $10 million in gold.</i>

37:13.479 --> 37:16.111
<i>The engineer and fireman of the
train, injured during the raid...</i>

37:16.232 --> 37:18.722
<i>...and the guards who were rendered
unconscious by the gas fumes...</i>

37:18.842 --> 37:21.567
<i>...have all been released from
the hospital at Vandervere, Utah.</i>

37:25.910 --> 37:28.970
<i>In an effort to trap the elusive
gold bandits, police have tightened...</i>

37:29.091 --> 37:31.766
<i>...the web by calling in reservists,
thus allowing them to establish an...</i>

37:31.886 --> 37:33.987
<i>...unprecedented number
of roadblocks, covering...</i>

37:34.107 --> 37:36.707
<i>...every highway and back
road as far east as Ohio.</i>

37:42.807 --> 37:45.980
<i>Authorities have asked all trucking
companies to put as few vehicles on...</i>

37:46.100 --> 37:49.488
<i>...the road as possible, in an attempt
to narrow down the truck traffic.</i>

38:12.773 --> 38:14.445
We're right, aren't we?

38:14.565 --> 38:16.788
If we wasn't, I'd have told you.

38:18.989 --> 38:19.878
There it is.

39:00.121 --> 39:02.523
Hey, fella: where's the, uh...?

39:02.774 --> 39:05.584
Right around the back, to the left.

39:05.819 --> 39:06.949
Fill it up, will you?

39:12.861 --> 39:16.493
Don't get many trucks nowadays
since the new highway's in.

39:16.925 --> 39:19.612
They, uh, caught those robbers yet?

39:19.647 --> 39:20.943
No...I don't know.

39:21.078 --> 39:22.350
They'll catch them.

39:22.385 --> 39:23.530
How's that?

39:24.923 --> 39:27.010
Can't help but catch them.

39:27.251 --> 39:29.691
Fellas like that hardly
have a chance nowadays...

39:29.811 --> 39:32.480
...with radio and all that
science against them.

39:32.601 --> 39:35.348
- You think so, huh?
- Ah, sure.

39:35.469 --> 39:40.329
Now back a few years ago, it was
different. A man had a real chance.

39:40.449 --> 39:44.140
Nowadays, everything's got a system
that's pretty hard to beat.

39:44.259 --> 39:46.242
I don't know.

39:46.362 --> 39:48.559
I still think it's possible.

39:48.679 --> 39:52.669
That's the way to talk. Don't let
an old codger like me get you down.

39:53.586 --> 39:57.101
Yes sir, I can remember when
I was a young buck like you...

40:00.453 --> 40:03.883
Oh, it'll take 25 or 30
gallons. It's almost empty.

40:04.585 --> 40:07.778
Yes sir, there are all
sorts of opportunity.

40:07.898 --> 40:10.797
That was my mistake: there's
too much opportunity!

40:10.919 --> 40:16.021
Now, if when I'd have been your age, I'd
have hitched onto one single thing...

40:16.141 --> 40:20.219
...and stuck to it -- heh -- there's
no telling where I'd be today.

40:21.330 --> 40:23.664
Y'know, that's what I'm planning to do.

40:23.784 --> 40:27.289
I figure that if a guy is going to
make it, he's got to specialize.

40:27.409 --> 40:30.055
He's got to find one thing and
stick to it, no matter what.

40:30.175 --> 40:31.769
That's the spirit.

40:34.035 --> 40:35.263
How's the oil?

40:35.384 --> 40:36.762
I'll check.

41:06.909 --> 41:09.870
No sir, that...that don't
mean nothing to me.

41:51.253 --> 41:52.731
Had to.

42:57.465 --> 43:01.436
Look, the Canadian border is only 500
miles from here. New York is 2000.

43:01.556 --> 43:04.707
Right. So the cops figured
they'd head for the border.

43:04.827 --> 43:08.130
I say they're smarter than that.
I say they're headed for New York.

43:08.251 --> 43:09.707
Well, you'll see.

43:11.861 --> 43:13.185
What would you like?

43:13.305 --> 43:16.848
A couple of ham sandwiches
and two coffees to go. Black.

43:16.967 --> 43:18.134
White or rye?

43:18.255 --> 43:19.381
White.

43:21.017 --> 43:23.156
You come through any roadblocks yet?

43:23.277 --> 43:26.199
- Any what?
- Roadblocks. You know, the gold robbery.

43:26.320 --> 43:28.187
Oh ... no, not yet.

43:30.151 --> 43:33.210
You know? I'd like to see
them get away with it.

43:33.330 --> 43:36.075
You've got to watch her, mister.
She's got a criminal mind.

43:36.195 --> 43:38.231
What would you do with
all that loot,  Hazel?

43:38.352 --> 43:41.506
Go to London and Paris.
Get the best of everything.

43:41.995 --> 43:46.612
Me, I'd build me the fastest job on the
road. About 4 inches off the ground...

43:46.732 --> 43:51.438
...4 pots, chrome heads, 3/4-inch cam.
That'd feed the cops a lot of smoke huh?

43:52.002 --> 43:55.599
<i>We now take you to Salt Lake City, where
our special correspondent John Oliver...</i>

43:55.719 --> 43:59.656
<i>...is standing by with further
information on the gold train robbery.</i>

43:59.776 --> 44:02.425
<i>The grim shadow of murder may have
fallen over the desperate flight of...</i>

44:02.545 --> 44:05.945
<i>...the gold thieves tonight. Less than
an hour ago, a passing motorist...</i>

44:06.066 --> 44:09.315
<i>...discovered the body of an elderly
gas station attendant, shot to death...</i>

44:09.435 --> 44:12.765
<i>...near Lynn, Nevada. Police ruled
out robbery as a motive when...</i>

44:12.885 --> 44:16.364
<i>...the victim's wallet and the money
in the cash drawer were found untouched.</i>

44:16.484 --> 44:19.388
<i>An unusually large sale was still
registered on the gas pump...</i>

44:19.508 --> 44:21.594
<i>...leading the authorities
to suspect the assailant...</i>

44:21.714 --> 44:23.765
<i>...to have been the driver
of a commercial vehicle.</i>

44:23.885 --> 44:27.002
<i>Investigators are now working on the
possibility that the killer may have...</i>

44:27.122 --> 44:28.913
<i>...been one of the gold train robbers.</i>

44:29.033 --> 44:31.953
<i>Stay tuned to this station
for further details.</i>

44:33.290 --> 44:35.882
What would make them
do a thing like that?

44:36.002 --> 44:37.285
Money.

44:40.556 --> 44:42.078
Dollar twenty. [$1.20]

44:42.198 --> 44:44.065
Keep the change, honey.

44:44.185 --> 44:46.750
Don't listen to him. He's always
very generous with my money.

44:46.871 --> 44:48.332
I know the type.

44:52.957 --> 44:54.223
I know.

44:55.739 --> 44:57.730
Driving back this way soon?

45:08.246 --> 45:09.492
I'll drive.

45:33.033 --> 45:35.839
Why would they pull a
stupid stunt like that?

45:38.430 --> 45:40.165
You know, Eddie...

45:40.673 --> 45:43.006
...maybe we shouldn't head for L.A.

45:43.300 --> 45:46.067
Maybe we should head
straight for the border.

45:47.277 --> 45:50.083
If you want to be scared,
Frankie, go ahead.

45:50.886 --> 45:52.525
But don't be stupid.

45:54.668 --> 45:57.533
An idea couldn't get past
the border right now.

46:13.166 --> 46:14.628
How old is your kid?

46:15.428 --> 46:17.178
- Hmm?
- How old is your kid?

46:17.298 --> 46:18.352
17.

46:20.375 --> 46:23.649
17, huh? Mine should be
about 11 around now.

46:24.760 --> 46:27.099
I thought you said you wasn't married.

46:27.430 --> 46:28.794
Never seen him.

46:37.309 --> 46:39.359
- A weighing station.
- Yeah.

47:07.075 --> 47:09.504
- What's your load?
- Coffee.

47:11.067 --> 47:15.021
He's 4500 pounds overweight.
Better check him.

47:51.101 --> 47:55.076
<i>We now take you to Salt Lake City and
our special correspondent John Oliver.</i>

47:55.194 --> 47:57.456
<i>Astute police work tonight
brought about the capture...</i>

47:57.576 --> 48:00.325
<i>...of two more members of the
gang that held up the gold train.</i>

48:00.444 --> 48:04.252
<i>Less than an hour ago, guards at the
small weighing station at Dalton, CA...</i>

48:04.371 --> 48:06.994
<i>...investigated the overweight
load of a truck heading west...</i>

48:07.113 --> 48:10.263
<i>...and found one third of the stolen
gold hidden in a load of coffee.</i>

48:10.382 --> 48:12.690
<i>Authorities are certain that
the remainder of the gang...</i>

48:12.809 --> 48:16.777
<i>...and the still-missing third are
in another truck, still at large.</i>

48:27.221 --> 48:30.269
Alright, here's the weighing
station. This is where they got...

48:30.389 --> 48:34.009
Commando and Skeets. They'll really
be on their toes, so watch your step.

48:53.400 --> 48:54.938
I'll do the talking.

48:56.597 --> 48:58.944
- Flammables?
- Chemicals.

49:00.279 --> 49:01.996
Let's see your manifest.

49:05.307 --> 49:08.601
One of you, come with me;
I've got to break your seal.

49:12.213 --> 49:14.209
That's against the law, isn't it?

49:14.329 --> 49:16.200
What's the matter, pal?

49:16.320 --> 49:20.138
Look, officer: I just drive this
thing. I'm not trying to be cute.

49:20.258 --> 49:23.005
But you know better than I do,
I can't let anyone break that seal.

49:23.125 --> 49:25.975
Buddy, we could impound this
whole truck, if we had to.

49:26.095 --> 49:28.054
Alright, you can have the
whole truck, but not...

49:28.174 --> 49:31.041
...until I get somebody's
name, and that paper.

50:04.903 --> 50:06.385
He's okay.

50:07.787 --> 50:08.838
Okay?

50:19.468 --> 50:20.483
Okay.

50:24.030 --> 50:25.766
Your buddy is pretty conscientious.

50:25.886 --> 50:29.314
Yeah, well, it's, uh, it's his
responsibility, you know?

50:52.292 --> 50:55.185
<i>Some authorities believe the bandits
may not be headed for the border, as...</i>

50:55.306 --> 50:59.770
<i>...reported earlier, but might have gone
into hiding somewhere in California.</i>

50:59.890 --> 51:02.601
<i>These officials point out that the
two trucks thus far captured...</i>

51:02.721 --> 51:06.277
<i>...were both taken on roads
which terminate in California.</i>

51:08.520 --> 51:11.696
<i>No news of the phantom truck
carrying $3.5 million in gold...</i>

51:11.816 --> 51:14.309
<i>...continues to be the
big news up to this hour.</i>

51:14.429 --> 51:18.986
<i>One thing that is agreed upon, however:
one truck and $3.5 million in gold...</i>

51:19.106 --> 51:21.618
<i>...seems to have vanished into thin air.</i>

51:47.313 --> 51:50.195
I want to place a call
to Los Angeles, please.

51:58.949 --> 52:00.605
Mr. Benjamin's office.

52:00.726 --> 52:01.932
Okay, honey.

52:23.638 --> 52:24.614
Yes, Fran?

52:24.734 --> 52:27.705
Mr. Benjamin, I'm sorry, but I'm
just not feeling well this morning.

52:27.826 --> 52:29.811
Do you think you can get
along without me today?

52:29.931 --> 52:33.532
Well, it'll be a struggle, but you
go on home. Anything I can do?

52:33.652 --> 52:35.857
No, thank you, don't bother.
I'll be alright in the morning.

52:35.877 --> 52:38.623
I hope so. And don't
fret about the office.

52:38.854 --> 52:39.669
Thank you.

55:38.296 --> 55:40.345
14 miles. Did you see that?

55:41.555 --> 55:42.803
We'll make it.

55:54.339 --> 55:55.743
What are you...?

56:04.517 --> 56:05.785
An ambulance.

56:06.916 --> 56:08.946
A stinking, lousy ambulance.

56:59.296 --> 57:00.540
Eddie?

57:00.661 --> 57:02.386
- Oh, hello, Frankie.
- Hi, Fran.

57:02.507 --> 57:03.986
I've got some coffee inside.

57:04.107 --> 57:08.250
Thanks, honey, but we've got to move.
Fast. Frank, get that hatch open.

01:00:37.578 --> 01:00:38.609
Yeah?

01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:41.611
We want to talk to you.

01:00:41.731 --> 01:00:44.554
- Well, what about?
- Air pollution control.

01:00:45.306 --> 01:00:46.280
What?

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.592
Smog control. You'd better clean
the oil lances on that furnace.

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:52.651
It's smoking worse than a tar
factory.  What's your name?

01:00:52.771 --> 01:00:55.811
Randy Holland. Well, I didn't
know a thing about it.

01:00:55.932 --> 01:00:58.812
I'll have it fixed first
thing in the morning.

01:00:58.931 --> 01:01:00.373
Now, look, uh...

01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:04.321
Do you have to do that, officer?
I'll have it fixed, first thing.

01:01:04.442 --> 01:01:07.966
I'm sorry, Mr. Holland. Can I
have your signature, please?

01:01:11.007 --> 01:01:14.909
You'll be notified when to appear
to show proof of the improvement.

01:01:15.396 --> 01:01:16.431
Thank you.

01:01:39.645 --> 01:01:40.862
A smog ticket.

01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:46.341
Come on, you'd better get some sleep.

01:01:46.462 --> 01:01:49.015
- Oh, I'm alright.
- Right now! Come on.

01:01:52.221 --> 01:01:53.606
Come on, Frankie.

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:30.735
What's the matter?

01:02:31.785 --> 01:02:33.811
Let's forget the whole thing.

01:02:33.932 --> 01:02:34.955
Huh?

01:02:35.969 --> 01:02:39.205
Let's forget the whole thing.
Let's leave right now.

01:02:41.111 --> 01:02:42.552
Are you crazy?

01:02:43.877 --> 01:02:45.849
After what we've been through?

01:02:49.259 --> 01:02:51.619
Look, you're going to
get everything you want.

01:02:53.327 --> 01:02:55.434
But I've got everything I want.

01:02:57.706 --> 01:02:59.597
I didn't want you to steal.

01:03:01.562 --> 01:03:03.759
Eddie, a man's been killed.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:08.384
It's 1 o'clock. We've got to be at
the pier by 10. Turn on some news.

01:03:11.064 --> 01:03:13.032
Come on, Frankie, wake up.

01:03:13.153 --> 01:03:16.269
Come on, wake up. We've
got all that plating to do.

01:03:41.577 --> 01:03:44.266
Alright, let's put the
chrome plate on it.

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.062
Easy, Frankie. Gold can't
take much strain, you know.

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:02.068
It'll bend like a pretzel.

01:04:34.335 --> 01:04:35.665
Everything all set, Frankie?

01:04:35.784 --> 01:04:37.884
Yeah. I burned all the clothes and
the furnace is shut off.

01:04:37.885 --> 01:04:38.675
Fran?

01:04:38.678 --> 01:04:40.239
All the doors and the
back gate are locked...

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.466
...and the rent's paid
until the end of the month.

01:04:43.586 --> 01:04:44.811
Thanks, honey.

01:04:47.953 --> 01:04:49.554
- Uh, Eddie?
- Yeah.

01:04:49.673 --> 01:04:51.818
What are we going to do
about these other cars?

01:04:51.938 --> 01:04:53.797
We'll just have to leave them here.

01:04:53.918 --> 01:04:56.378
Yeah, but if somebody busts in, you
know what they're going to find?

01:04:56.501 --> 01:05:00.457
One car registered to Mrs. Cora Riley
and the other to Ann Martin.

01:05:01.826 --> 01:05:03.404
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:05:04.752 --> 01:05:06.412
- You set to go?
- Yeah.

01:05:06.533 --> 01:05:08.152
Alright, start her up.

01:05:54.903 --> 01:05:59.120
Better slow down a little. We don't
want to get stopped by a traffic cop.

01:06:01.856 --> 01:06:04.364
Relax, Frankie.
We've got it made!

01:06:05.571 --> 01:06:08.969
I'm not going to relax until we get
on that freeway and out of L.A.

01:06:09.091 --> 01:06:10.833
The boat doesn't
leave until 11:00...

01:06:10.953 --> 01:06:13.825
...but we do have to have the car
on the loading dock by 10:15.

01:06:13.945 --> 01:06:17.530
Ah, we'll make it with a half
hour to spare. Right, Frankie?

01:06:17.958 --> 01:06:19.201
Yeah, sure.

01:06:22.448 --> 01:06:24.237
How's she handling?

01:06:24.359 --> 01:06:27.194
Aw, a little sluggish.
We'll make it alright.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.313
Hey...

01:06:30.265 --> 01:06:31.935
There's the freeway now.

01:06:51.677 --> 01:06:55.167
Well, another 40 minutes and we'll
be in [San] Pedro [an L.A. seaport].

01:06:55.288 --> 01:06:57.250
How do you feel now, Frankie?

01:06:59.003 --> 01:07:01.770
How much is my half
of this jalopy worth?

01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:04.202
Where we're going, roughly...

01:07:04.323 --> 01:07:05.932
...a million.

01:07:06.050 --> 01:07:07.603
That's how I feel.

01:07:07.722 --> 01:07:08.988
Like a million.

01:07:12.966 --> 01:07:15.473
Good to hear you laughing again, honey.

01:07:16.446 --> 01:07:18.253
I just hope it can last.

01:07:18.375 --> 01:07:20.062
You leave that to me.

01:07:20.183 --> 01:07:24.547
Sure, Fran. You take a tip from me:
worrying doesn't get you a thing.

01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:26.736
Gray hair and wrinkles. Look.

01:07:26.855 --> 01:07:28.389
No gray hair.

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:30.487
Like a baby's.

01:07:33.398 --> 01:07:35.142
- Passports.
- What?

01:07:35.262 --> 01:07:37.313
Oh...I've got them right here.

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:40.711
All 6 of them.

01:07:44.501 --> 01:07:45.766
Any trouble?

01:07:46.894 --> 01:07:49.960
No, Tony had them ready,
along with the manifests.

01:07:50.701 --> 01:07:51.865
There you are.

01:07:53.791 --> 01:07:55.889
As soon as we get aboard ship...

01:07:57.049 --> 01:07:58.700
...I'll destroy these 3.

01:08:02.861 --> 01:08:04.280
Hey, look.

01:08:05.388 --> 01:08:06.421
Roadblock.

01:08:17.265 --> 01:08:21.233
It's got to be a roadblock. Why else
would it be piled up like this?

01:08:21.353 --> 01:08:23.798
The morning rush.

01:08:23.917 --> 01:08:26.602
The people who work
for a living, Frankie.

01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:35.551
We haven't moved a mile in 5 minutes.
I've never seen so many cars.

01:08:35.671 --> 01:08:37.557
I love every one of them.

01:08:37.676 --> 01:08:40.506
Well, if they did have a roadblock here,
we would have heard about it by now..

01:08:40.627 --> 01:08:42.223
...wouldn't we, Eddie?

01:08:42.345 --> 01:08:47.298
The police don't know who we are, or
where we are, or what we're driving.

01:08:47.419 --> 01:08:49.854
And the longer they stay confused...

01:08:51.486 --> 01:08:55.761
And after we get aboard that ship,
it's only a few weeks to Lisbon.

01:09:01.602 --> 01:09:03.258
<i>Here is a traffic bulletin:</i>

01:09:03.377 --> 01:09:06.769
<i>Police state that the harbor freeway
outbound is heavily congested from...</i>

01:09:06.889 --> 01:09:10.072
<i>...the interchange to the Washington
Blvd. exit, due to a traffic accident.</i>

01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:12.309
Now, that's just great.

01:09:12.429 --> 01:09:15.294
First they get you piled up like this,
and then they tell you there's a wreck!

01:09:15.416 --> 01:09:17.203
Don't you ever stop complaining?

01:09:17.323 --> 01:09:20.526
Yeah, but if we knew about it,
we could have taken the off-road!

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.474
We haven't moved a...

01:09:22.475 --> 01:09:25.104
... a mile in the last 5 minutes.
Yeah, I know.

01:09:25.904 --> 01:09:28.899
Hey, look, we must be
getting near the accident.

01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:49.895
That was smart, lady!

01:09:50.017 --> 01:09:52.555
Well, I'm terribly sorry. I guess
I just wasn't paying any attention.

01:09:52.675 --> 01:09:54.559
- Yeah, well, you guessed right!
- Frankie.

01:09:54.678 --> 01:09:56.739
Really, I said I was sorry.

01:09:56.857 --> 01:09:59.011
I am insured, and I'll be
happy to do anything I can...

01:09:59.133 --> 01:10:01.385
10 mph and you can't stop. What
are you, blind or something?

01:10:01.506 --> 01:10:03.482
Alright, alright, no
need to talk that way.

01:10:03.483 --> 01:10:04.840
Well, it's alright, officer.

01:10:04.844 --> 01:10:07.142
Let's forget the whole thing, you stay
where you are, lady, it's my car...

01:10:07.263 --> 01:10:09.447
...anyway, we'll get the cars
unhooked, come on Frankie.

01:10:09.568 --> 01:10:12.693
- Let's get a hold of this thing.
- It's alright officer, we've got it.

01:10:12.813 --> 01:10:14.602
Now let me give it a hand.

01:10:14.923 --> 01:10:17.108
Step down on there, will you, sir?

01:10:18.263 --> 01:10:20.267
You've got to get all
your weight on there.

01:10:20.385 --> 01:10:21.624
Look, uh...

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:25.010
If anything happens, you
get lost in the crowd.

01:10:25.131 --> 01:10:26.731
- What?
- Well, we've got to separate.

01:10:26.751 --> 01:10:27.453
- Oh Eddie, no.

01:10:27.454 --> 01:10:30.235
Remember what I told you now.
The Whitman Hotel in San Pedro.

01:10:31.254 --> 01:10:33.999
Look officer, you got lots better things
to do than this.  We can handle it.

01:10:34.119 --> 01:10:36.096
Nah, we'll get it in a minute.

01:10:44.284 --> 01:10:46.671
Hey, George.
Look at that bumper.

01:10:46.793 --> 01:10:48.192
It's ... gold!

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:51.518
We'd better check it.
