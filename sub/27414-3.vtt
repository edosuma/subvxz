00:35.760 --> 00:36.760
Shit.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.760
Ooh, John, it's getting late.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.360
I need to get my kip.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.760
I do hope you're not playing for time.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.360
(FOOTBALL ANNOUNCER SPEAKING

01:50.280 --> 01:51.280
Oh, I, er...

01:51.960 --> 01:54.040
I'd leave Alastair to sleep for a while.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.960
The poor thing's quite exhausted.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.920
Yeah, I'll bet he is.

02:00.920 --> 02:01.920
Cheeky.

02:08.680 --> 02:11.840
Good night, chaps.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.320
Alice.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.280
What have you done?

02:46.920 --> 02:47.920
Guess.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.920
We were out from under it.
We were clear.

02:54.160 --> 02:55.160
And now?

02:58.240 --> 02:59.240
Come with me.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.240
I don't think
I'm going to do that, John.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.600
No.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.080
Oh... Come here!

03:13.080 --> 03:15.920
Oh, God, you...

03:16.160 --> 03:18.000
So you like it like this?

03:19.720 --> 03:21.400
You just have to say... Oh, ow!

03:25.960 --> 03:26.960
ALICE: Oh!

JEREMY: Still awake?

05:21.840 --> 05:22.840
Barely.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.000
I'm too tired.

05:28.840 --> 05:29.840
Come on.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.400
Listen.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.080
Look,

05:47.000 --> 05:48.720
I know what you went through yesterday.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.440
And I know it was my fault.

05:52.440 --> 05:53.480
Won't happen again.

05:55.640 --> 05:56.840
I worry about you, that's all.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.600
I want you to be safe.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.480
I am.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.440
I just get carried away.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.040
It's like, er...

06:21.680 --> 06:23.240
Do you remember
the hitchhiker in Australia?

06:24.120 --> 06:25.440
Little Miss Birkenstock.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.880
That was something we did together,
according to the rules, far from home,

06:32.880 --> 06:33.880
on holiday.

06:34.440 --> 06:35.800
We did it spontaneously,

06:36.320 --> 06:37.480
spur of the moment.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.360
-Yeah, but we discussed it.
-Briefly.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.760
But it was still within the parameters
of our agreement, Jeremy.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.600
If that still means anything to you...

06:49.720 --> 06:50.720
Of course, it does.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.760
Because the balance of risk has shifted.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.080
You're being too reckless.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.720
I need you to understand that.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.160
To really understand it.

07:09.160 --> 07:13.160
The risk to me, to my life,
to my career,

07:14.320 --> 07:15.320
my liberty.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.360
I do.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.280
I'm sorry.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.040
I love you.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.520
I love you, too.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.400
ALICE: Are we there yet, John?

08:22.320 --> 08:23.600
Are we there yet, John?

08:25.040 --> 08:26.520
Are we there yet

08:35.240 --> 08:36.960
Oh, you have to be kidding.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.720
So I take it I'm being arrested.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.840
Because you do remember how many crimes
we've committed together?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.680
Is that a threat?

08:53.560 --> 08:54.560
Absolutely.

08:55.320 --> 08:56.320
Okay.

09:00.920 --> 09:01.920
I'll be watching you.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.360
Just be here when I get back.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.000
Wait, wait, wait.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.560
My wig is making my scalp itch.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.200
Would you please remove it for me?

09:13.040 --> 09:14.040
Please?

09:18.600 --> 09:19.680
Stay there.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.360
Looks like your mate's come through,
old sausage.

10:01.640 --> 10:04.200
CORNELIUS:  All right,
meet me at Milton Arches

10:04.720 --> 10:05.960
in 45.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.520
Once she's in my care, I'll make a call.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.280
Your old pal here is free to go.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.600
Alice, whatever you're doing
in there, stop it.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.000
It itches.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.160
JOHN:  No, listen.

10:21.480 --> 10:22.520
Stay still and wait.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.760
JOHN: Yes, okay.

11:28.960 --> 11:30.080
Address is...

11:38.680 --> 11:39.960
Freedom.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.720
Shit!

12:13.600 --> 12:14.760
Hold still.

12:16.880 --> 12:17.880
Yeah.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.040
Come on.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.160
Come on.

13:12.680 --> 13:13.680
ALICE: Hop in, John.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.840
Well, I was handcuffed in the back seat
with an itchy wig and nothing to do

13:23.920 --> 13:25.160
except chew things over,

13:25.840 --> 13:27.680
and it occurred to me
that George Cornelius

13:27.760 --> 13:30.720
must know you well enough
to be acquainted with your weaknesses.

13:32.560 --> 13:33.720
-Other people.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.440
So if I were him, what would I do?

13:36.520 --> 13:38.200
I'd say, "Bring me Alice Morgan,

13:38.640 --> 13:41.920
"or I will do something absolutely
dastardly to Person X."

13:42.000 --> 13:43.240
Am I warm?

13:43.320 --> 13:44.600
-Toasty.
-Mmm.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.720
And you actually considered doing it,
didn't you?

13:47.800 --> 13:49.360
-Yeah.
-Giving me to him.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.440
Oh, yeah.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.280
But you couldn't go through with it.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.040
-No.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.240
You know why not.

13:58.760 --> 13:59.760
Then say it.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.440
Fine, then. Super.

14:13.880 --> 14:14.880
JEREMY: Darling?

14:16.960 --> 14:17.960
Darling.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.520
Darling, are you awake?

15:26.760 --> 15:28.120
ALICE: I don't know how else to say it.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.720
We have guns.

15:32.920 --> 15:33.920
It's not gonna happen.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.640
You do know they won't be so generous?

15:38.360 --> 15:40.120
They'll kill you as soon
as they look at you.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.760
And you are very nice.

15:42.840 --> 15:45.120
Alice, I don't care who gets hurt.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.600
All right? Knock yourself out,
break legs, but no one dies.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.280
I really don't see
why it matters.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.320
-I know you don't, but it still does.
-Fine.

16:06.280 --> 16:09.680
ALICE:
Where's the key? Ha!

16:15.360 --> 16:16.360
Come on.

16:17.960 --> 16:18.960
Please.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.920
Emergency.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.200
What service do you require?

17:48.280 --> 17:49.600
Oh, good evening.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.560
A concerned citizen
has absolutely insisted

17:52.640 --> 17:54.480
that I let you know about a fire

17:54.880 --> 17:57.080
at the Lock N' Roller storage
on the Wolcott Road.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.560
Cheerio.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.760
Come on, my pretty.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.480
Come here, my pretty.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.080
That's it. One.

18:16.760 --> 18:17.760
Two.

18:30.960 --> 18:31.960
Move!

19:05.720 --> 19:06.880
-Drop it.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.080
-Drop it!

19:13.800 --> 19:15.000
Benny comes with me.

19:29.840 --> 19:30.840
What?

19:32.840 --> 19:33.840
Fucking what?

19:57.240 --> 19:58.360
ALICE: What are you doing?

19:58.880 --> 20:00.160
Minding my own business.

20:00.280 --> 20:01.640
-Oh, dear God above.

20:01.720 --> 20:02.920
Morning, boss!

20:03.000 --> 20:04.600
-I've been trying to get a hold of you.
-I bet you have.

20:04.680 --> 20:05.680
-Mmm-hmm.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.960
No, not you. Sorry, listen,
I've had a bear of a morning.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.040
Erm, I've been thinking,

20:10.120 --> 20:12.880
whose head was Jeremy Lake looking at
on the MRI scan? It feels wrong.

20:12.960 --> 20:13.960
Great minds! I'm on my way

20:14.040 --> 20:15.640
-to find out now.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.000
It's not enough for a warrant.

20:17.320 --> 20:19.640
HALLIDAY: Er, no worries, erm,
I don't need one.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.400
Well, don't do anything stupid.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.840
Well, no promises,

20:22.920 --> 20:25.600
but I was actually aiming
for the opposite of stupid, so...

20:25.720 --> 20:27.120
JOHN: All right, you let me know.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.240
Oh, will you keep your phone on?

20:28.320 --> 20:30.040
Yeah, no,
I'll call back as soon as I can.

20:30.120 --> 20:32.160
Now, listen, can you
cover for me?

20:32.280 --> 20:33.600
HALLIDAY: Okay, bye.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.760
Oh, my God, she's chirpy.
Must be insufferable.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.600
We need to lay low until this is sorted.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.480
Where we can go that's safe?

20:45.240 --> 20:47.040
Nowhere where Cornelius
can be watching us,

20:47.120 --> 20:48.760
which rules out your place or my place.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.400
And Alice's.

21:18.640 --> 21:19.840
MIRIAM:  Jeremy Lake's office.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.880
Hello, can I speak
with Dr Lake, please?

21:22.040 --> 21:24.160
I'm afraid Mr Lake's
not yet in the office.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.600
I'm sorry, could you just hold the line
for a moment?

21:26.680 --> 21:28.160
Hi. Sorry, sorry.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.640
I think I left my glasses
in here yesterday.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.440
They're roundish and tortoise shell.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.000
Well, Mr Lake would usually
give them to me. He didn't say anything.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.080
Oh, right.

21:38.160 --> 21:40.520
It's just that I'm pretty sure
I had them when I went in there.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.440
Do you think I could just have
quick squizz around

21:42.520 --> 21:44.120
-and I won't break anything.

21:44.360 --> 21:45.760
Fine. Please try not to.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.200
Thank you.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.120
-Hello, Mr Lake's office.
Dr Lake, please?

22:19.280 --> 22:20.720
It's a matter of urgency.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.400
Okay.

22:39.560 --> 22:40.800
Would you mind calling back?

22:48.680 --> 22:49.920
I can't find them.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.560
Such a shame. Thank you.

23:22.880 --> 23:23.880
MARK: Okay.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.800
So you brought the devil
around for breakfast.

23:29.080 --> 23:30.440
Mark, I need a favour.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.280
CELIA: Who did you say these belong to?

23:36.320 --> 23:38.840
HALLIDAY: It belongs
to a person of interest.

23:39.440 --> 23:41.920
CELIA: Which doesn't quite
answer the question, does it?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.200
HALLIDAY: It doesn't really, does it?

23:44.560 --> 23:45.720
What did you think of the cake?

23:48.240 --> 23:50.840
Well, whoever it belongs to is very ill.

23:51.520 --> 23:53.040
-Look.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.040
I'd need to confirm it, of course,
but this here...

23:57.200 --> 23:58.360
-...looks to me

23:58.440 --> 24:00.080
like a frontal lobe tumour.

24:00.760 --> 24:01.760
Okay.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.280
And what are the symptoms of that?

24:14.680 --> 24:15.680
Hello, I'm Jeremy.

24:29.600 --> 24:31.360
What are you going to do to me?

24:32.600 --> 24:33.600
What do you think?

24:35.960 --> 24:37.120
Why?

24:39.040 --> 24:40.480
JEREMY: Because I like it.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.360
It's basically all I've ever thought
about since I was about yea big.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.320
Jeremy.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.840
Oh, that's terribly good.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.360
I just dangle my name
and you swim along and snatch it up.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.840
I expect you're trying
to humanise yourself.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.480
You'll be telling me
about your husband next.

24:59.360 --> 25:01.200
Your mum and dad,
maybe the babies you want to have.

25:01.600 --> 25:05.360
I've got money.
I can get you money.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.640
JEREMY: No, you can't.

25:08.480 --> 25:09.880
I don't need money.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.000
What I need right now
is to head off to work.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.480
And all day,
as I'm slicing into people...

25:14.960 --> 25:16.760
No, don't. Please, don't.

25:17.120 --> 25:19.880
-I'll be thinking about...

25:20.240 --> 25:22.400
I'll be thinking about
what I want you to do for me.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.520
Do you want to know what that is?

25:29.480 --> 25:30.680
-No.

25:34.800 --> 25:38.160
I don't know. Don't do this, please.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.880
There's a phenomenon
known as Stockholm syndrome.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.480
I expect you've heard of it in a meme
or something.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.120
So in the spirit of scientific inquiry,

25:47.920 --> 25:51.200
I'm going to keep you down here
until you fall in love with me.

25:51.720 --> 25:53.000
Er, what?

25:54.080 --> 25:55.600
I know it sounds difficult

25:55.720 --> 25:57.680
to believe at first blush,
but it will happen.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.200
And in the end...

26:01.040 --> 26:02.880
What? No.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.520
When you've learned

26:05.360 --> 26:07.120
not only to love me, but to adore me,

26:08.160 --> 26:10.160
when you've cast aside all desire
ever to leave me,

26:10.240 --> 26:11.920
that's when you get to leave.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.360
When you no longer want to.

26:22.520 --> 26:23.920
Right, off to work.

26:25.560 --> 26:26.720
Oh, and one more thing.

26:27.920 --> 26:28.920
My wife is very jealous.

26:29.560 --> 26:30.720
Very possessive.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.640
If she finds out
I've got, well, a mistress down here,

26:33.720 --> 26:35.160
she'll strangle you
with your own ovaries.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.520
So, quiet as a mouse, eh?

27:50.560 --> 27:52.480
Errol, it's Benny.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.440
Look, I know you're probably sleeping,

27:55.360 --> 27:57.240
but I need you to lay low
till I get home.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.360
Okay?

28:10.560 --> 28:11.560
Make yourself at home.

28:11.640 --> 28:12.880
ALICE: Oh, you're very nice.

28:13.320 --> 28:14.960
Er, do you have any bacon?

28:15.640 --> 28:18.000
MARK: I've been a vegetarian
since I was 17.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.200
Of course you have.

28:23.560 --> 28:25.520
So the last I heard you were...

28:26.640 --> 28:31.240
Well, quite,
but apparently only the good die young.

28:31.560 --> 28:32.720
MARK: Well, then, congratulations.

28:33.400 --> 28:34.960
-You can expect to live forever.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.720
Well, I'm certainly
gonna give it a whirl.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.400
Mark, I'm really sorry
to do this to you.

28:44.840 --> 28:45.840
My wife's at work.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.760
You need to be done
by the time she gets back.

28:48.040 --> 28:49.320
She won't even know we're here.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.040
Just do what you need to do and move on.

28:51.200 --> 28:52.640
Don't drink all the orange juice.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.240
And don't get blood on the sofa.

29:03.600 --> 29:04.880
Massey, stop by the gate.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.280
You looking for business, darling?

29:36.480 --> 29:38.920
You know, the last time
we had a chat like this off the record,

29:39.040 --> 29:41.720
on the QT,
I swear you were wearing flares.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.600
And you were wearing a sheepskin coat

29:46.360 --> 29:48.360
and a pair of Foster Grants.

29:51.840 --> 29:55.840
So what were you doing there, George,
mop

29:55.920 --> 29:57.960
A police officer? One of your own.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.600
Tell me. What did he do, rob a bank?

29:59.680 --> 30:01.280
Possibly. I don't care.

30:01.680 --> 30:02.680
Oh.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.280
Well, you make me nostalgic
for the dead days,

30:05.360 --> 30:08.000
Martin, time was you'd
have dragged me out of this motor

30:08.080 --> 30:10.240
and beaten my tripes out
with a pickaxe handle.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.160
As you say,

30:13.240 --> 30:14.400
dead days.

30:18.440 --> 30:19.880
Well, you tell that to your lad.

30:21.040 --> 30:22.080
He's bent as a pin.

30:23.760 --> 30:24.840
I met his lady friend.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.240
God above.

30:30.240 --> 30:33.720
Well, I can't answer
those questions, George,

30:33.960 --> 30:38.040
without knowing precisely the nature
of your allegation.

30:38.320 --> 30:42.320
And of the many crimes
I know you've committed

30:42.400 --> 30:44.680
down the years, being a snitch

30:45.280 --> 30:46.480
was never one of them.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.640
Now, I don't know what's
going on between you and Luther,

30:51.320 --> 30:54.600
but you need to stay away
from my officer, George.

30:56.240 --> 30:57.240
Or I'll have you.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:26.880 --> 31:28.280
Have you managed to get a hold of Errol?

31:28.600 --> 31:29.600
BENNY: No.

31:32.760 --> 31:33.760
It's going to be okay.

31:35.520 --> 31:38.120
There's no way Cornelius is sending
his boys to your flat.

31:39.200 --> 31:40.880
And to be fair, that's easy
for you to say.

31:42.360 --> 31:44.520
You haven't spent half the morning
spitting your teeth out.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.040
Benny, I'm going to put this right.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.920
Okay, I'm... I'm going to make it right
by you, mate.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
How?

31:52.600 --> 31:53.680
This isn't the militant wing

31:53.760 --> 31:55.480
of the National Trust
we're dealing with here.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.160
It's George Cornelius.
You don't go up against him.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.520
You know, I always thought
she'd be the end of you.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.200
I didn't think
she'd be the end of us all.

32:10.920 --> 32:11.920
Yeah, well, Benny...

32:14.800 --> 32:16.160
It's going to get worse.

32:17.160 --> 32:18.160
A lot worse.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.880
There's something Cornelius
doesn't know yet.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.320
Shift's over, Donnie.
Go home and get some kip.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.320
CORNELIUS: His Nibs all right up there?

32:32.560 --> 32:33.640
DONNIE: Fine.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.840
I haven't heard a peep since, er...

32:37.120 --> 32:38.120
CORNELIUS: Since what?

32:39.520 --> 32:40.520
DONNIE: The present.

32:44.840 --> 32:45.840
The what?

32:46.800 --> 32:48.400
The welcome-home present you asked for.

33:00.320 --> 33:01.400
No.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.320
George.

33:14.520 --> 33:15.640
George.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.600
She was just...

33:19.200 --> 33:20.400
I didn't know.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.400
She just...

33:23.600 --> 33:24.920
She just walked in.

33:27.040 --> 33:28.760
She just walked in.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.320
Oh, Mr Lake.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.400
The police were here again.

34:06.560 --> 34:07.560
Mmm.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.280
Mr Palmer,

35:07.360 --> 35:08.840
we spoke once before.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.520
Just convenience, that's all.

35:14.760 --> 35:15.840
What are you doing?

35:17.240 --> 35:18.240
Work.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.840
-Can't avoid it. John.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.080
What am I avoiding?

35:22.800 --> 35:24.800
Er, pretty good,

35:25.200 --> 35:28.080
I think. Well, enough to be confident
that James Hauser

35:28.400 --> 35:29.600
didn't kill anyone.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.360
Er, boss?

35:32.480 --> 35:33.480
Erm...
-Yeah, yeah.

35:33.560 --> 35:34.680
Yeah, I'm here. Go on.

35:34.840 --> 35:37.800
HALLIDAY: Okay, so I was looking through
the file last night and I saw something.

35:38.440 --> 35:39.440
Just a small thing, really,

35:39.520 --> 35:41.280
but on the back of it
I got some analysis done.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.720
A CCTV image of the killer
and one of James Hauser.

35:45.160 --> 35:48.920
And they're stood next to what
turned out to be identical lampposts.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.680
It's two men. Similar heights,

35:51.760 --> 35:52.760
but not identical.

35:52.840 --> 35:55.600
Well, yeah, that doesn't mean
Hauser wasn't good for any of it.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.200
I had this thing once,
it was two brothers...

35:58.280 --> 36:00.240
Er, I think
this is a whole different thing.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.400
I was talking to Celia yesterday
at the autopsy,

36:03.480 --> 36:06.560
and she was talking about
what it takes to slice your own throat

36:06.640 --> 36:08.640
without hesitation. Now, yes,

36:09.040 --> 36:12.480
James Hauser was into self-mutilation,
but with pins and needles.

36:12.560 --> 36:13.840
He liked insertion.

36:13.920 --> 36:15.640
But slicing your own throat
with a scalpel,

36:15.720 --> 36:17.200
that's a whole different proposition.

36:17.280 --> 36:18.920
Now, who uses a scalpel?

36:19.600 --> 36:21.480
And who's in a position
to manipulate James,

36:21.840 --> 36:23.560
to put him exactly
where they want him to be?

36:23.680 --> 36:26.560
Now I think he was a patsy,
and I think they've set him up

36:26.640 --> 36:29.240
to look responsible for the crimes
committed by Jeremy Lake.

36:30.280 --> 36:32.360
And the MRI scan.

36:32.440 --> 36:35.080
Now, I think Jeremy was looking
at his own head.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.200
Because whoever it is has a non-operable
tumour on his frontal lobe.

36:38.400 --> 36:41.440
And now, if it is him, it could
be affecting his... His behaviour,

36:41.760 --> 36:43.440
his judgment, disinhibiting him.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.400
DCI Luther?

36:45.960 --> 36:46.960
Yeah.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.080
John, we've got a missing person.

36:51.320 --> 36:52.680
Penny Leyton.

36:52.840 --> 36:55.480
Her partner came home from work
last night and declared her missing.

36:55.720 --> 36:58.760
Yeah, the local police have accessed
some CCTV footage.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.080
I'm sending it through to you now.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.760
I'll meet you as the hospital.

37:02.160 --> 37:04.640
All right. Yeah, I'm...
Yeah, I'm coming.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.880
-You have to be joking.

37:09.800 --> 37:10.800
There's a woman missing.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.080
So?

37:12.360 --> 37:13.760
So I knew who took her.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.640
-ALICE: She's not your responsibility...
-She is my responsibility.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.600
-We are.
-I knew, Alice.

37:17.680 --> 37:19.800
I looked this prick in the eyes and I...

37:19.960 --> 37:22.160
What, how

37:25.800 --> 37:27.480
-I let him go because I was...

37:28.640 --> 37:29.920
Well, I'm flattered.

37:30.440 --> 37:32.440
But I do hope you remember
that if it weren't for me,

37:32.520 --> 37:34.080
you'd be dead or in prison.

37:34.800 --> 37:37.280
Either way, you wouldn't be
galloping to anyone's rescue.

37:38.280 --> 37:40.760
-I can't let this go. I just can't.
-You have to, John.

37:41.240 --> 37:43.960
-George Cornelius is...
-I can handle George Cornelius.

37:44.040 --> 37:45.200
No, you can't, John.

37:46.560 --> 37:47.880
Not in the way you'd like to.

37:50.040 --> 37:51.040
We're past that.

38:31.480 --> 38:32.560
Oh.

40:09.720 --> 40:11.920
-DCI Luther.
-George.

40:13.240 --> 40:15.960
I'm sorry it's come to this,
but we are where we are.

40:16.840 --> 40:19.360
Now, you have two options,
you bring it back from the brink, or...

40:19.440 --> 40:21.280
-JOHN: I take you down.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.840
I take you, your family, everything.

40:26.080 --> 40:27.280
Brick by brick.

40:27.560 --> 40:29.480
You'll be the king
of a smoking hill, mate.

40:29.560 --> 40:33.200
-My son is dead, John.

40:33.360 --> 40:34.360
I know.

40:34.480 --> 40:36.560
I know and it shouldn't have happened,
but it did.

40:38.080 --> 40:39.280
Now take a step back.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.840
Don't make me go to war.

40:45.840 --> 40:48.440
You should have lied,
arranged a meeting.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.520
No.

40:49.600 --> 40:50.800
No point lying to him.

40:51.360 --> 40:52.520
He'd have known.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.360
Confirm transfer.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.040
Here you go.

41:25.440 --> 41:26.440
I had to try.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.080
I know.

41:29.560 --> 41:30.560
But you're right.

41:32.680 --> 41:33.760
It's too far gone.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.800
-He won't stop now.
-No.

41:38.240 --> 41:39.400
I have to end it.

41:40.200 --> 41:41.280
Yes.

41:42.280 --> 41:43.280
Now.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.200
Just got to take care
of this other thing first.

41:50.360 --> 41:53.440
-John, you can't...
-Take it, leave it. I don't care, Alice.

41:55.520 --> 41:56.720
Tonight, then.

41:57.560 --> 41:58.680
Tonight.

41:58.880 --> 41:59.960
Do you know how?

42:01.880 --> 42:03.000
I do know how.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.960
-For what it's worth, I am sorry.
-No,

42:11.720 --> 42:12.720
you're not.

42:15.320 --> 42:17.040
Give this to Benny
and don't let Mark see it.

42:22.080 --> 42:24.280
I'm not apologising for what's happened,

42:26.360 --> 42:27.920
I'm regretting what's to come.

43:10.840 --> 43:12.840
-Good morning, sleepyhead.
I can't believe

43:13.000 --> 43:16.520
you did that, after everything you said,

43:17.400 --> 43:18.400
all your promises.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.880
-Viv, I'm not sure what you mean.
-VIVIEN: I mean

43:22.200 --> 43:23.560
the bitch in the basement.

44:04.200 --> 44:07.480
Viv, darling, er, sorry,
but things have taken a turn.

44:07.560 --> 44:08.640
You have to get rid of it.

44:08.960 --> 44:11.160
You have to do whatever you can
as quickly as possible to get rid of it.

44:11.240 --> 44:12.240
I'll explain when I can.

44:44.560 --> 44:48.920
SCHENK: DCI Luther, how lovely of you
to put in an appearance.

44:49.360 --> 44:52.080
Sorry, boss, I've had a funny odd day.

44:53.400 --> 44:56.200
Jeremy Lake left before we arrived,
but his car is still here.

44:56.400 --> 44:57.840
I should have nicked him
when I had the chance.

44:58.160 --> 44:59.200
SCHENK: There were no grounds.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.640
-I should have made grounds.
-SCHENK: So,

45:02.160 --> 45:03.160
what made him run?

45:03.360 --> 45:05.400
Sir, I was here earlier today.

45:06.480 --> 45:08.560
Erm, yeah, maybe that spooked him.

45:08.720 --> 45:09.840
You were here earlier?

45:10.240 --> 45:11.320
Doing what?

45:11.400 --> 45:12.400
JOHN: Nothing, really.

45:12.560 --> 45:14.880
Erm, I asked DS Halliday to interview

45:14.960 --> 45:16.600
the secretary before

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
he came into work.

45:18.520 --> 45:20.840
I mean, that couldn't have spooked him.
That was hours ago.

45:22.120 --> 45:23.160
SCHENK: So why did he run?

45:24.120 --> 45:25.680
What does he know
and how does he know it?

45:25.760 --> 45:27.000
See, I don't think

45:27.080 --> 45:28.680
that is the question
that's going to find him.

45:29.840 --> 45:31.080
SCHENK: Then I'd like to know what is.

45:32.440 --> 45:34.800
It's what she knows. Vivien Lake.

45:36.160 --> 45:37.160
JOHN: I don't think

45:37.920 --> 45:40.640
that Vivien is his accomplice.

45:40.760 --> 45:44.080
I think she cleans up for him
and she hates him for it.

45:44.400 --> 45:46.560
So does that mean
Vivien doesn't know about Penny Leyton?

45:47.400 --> 45:48.560
Let's find out.

46:08.520 --> 46:09.520
It's okay.

46:31.680 --> 46:32.680
It's okay.

46:41.480 --> 46:42.480
It's okay.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.160
Oh, God.

47:32.880 --> 47:35.120
-Cheers.
-You're very welcome.

47:41.800 --> 47:42.920
ERROL:  Hello, who's this?

47:43.720 --> 47:44.960
Errol, it's Ben.

47:45.120 --> 47:46.440
I'm just checking in.

47:46.680 --> 47:48.160
-ERROL: Yeah.

47:48.520 --> 47:49.520
I got the messages.

47:50.080 --> 47:51.080
Where've you been?

47:52.200 --> 47:53.360
My leg, mate.

47:56.240 --> 47:57.320
Listen,

47:58.200 --> 48:01.240
take whatever you want from the fridge,
don't scratch my records,

48:01.320 --> 48:02.320
but whatever you do,

48:02.400 --> 48:04.280
keep your head down, all right, brother?

48:04.360 --> 48:06.120
No worries. You okay?

48:06.680 --> 48:07.680
BENNY: Yeah.

48:08.320 --> 48:09.320
Tickety-boo.

48:09.480 --> 48:10.600
ERROL: Sweet.

48:10.840 --> 48:11.960
Cheers then, Ben.

48:12.120 --> 48:13.480
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

48:18.800 --> 48:19.800
So there's the number, okay?

48:21.040 --> 48:22.040
It's a landline.

48:23.720 --> 48:25.200
-In a moment.

48:26.200 --> 48:28.600
Right now I need you to relax
for a few seconds, Errol.

48:29.480 --> 48:30.920
Just a few seconds. We're nearly there.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.840
I need you to trace a landline for me.

48:41.560 --> 48:42.640
I'm sending the number now.

48:46.520 --> 48:47.920
Okay, is that it?

48:48.840 --> 48:49.840
Are we done?

48:57.360 --> 48:58.360
That's it.

50:15.320 --> 50:16.320
HALLIDAY: Vivien?

50:21.360 --> 50:22.360
Vivien?

50:33.400 --> 50:34.400
Nothing.

50:37.200 --> 50:38.640
I'll put a trace on her phone.

50:39.080 --> 50:41.560
I'll dig up CCTV
within a quarter-mile radius

50:41.720 --> 50:43.320
and find out what time she left.

50:43.920 --> 50:45.000
With an ANPR.

50:46.080 --> 50:47.240
Boss.

50:47.480 --> 50:48.480
Her car's still here.

50:59.480 --> 51:00.480
-Shut up!

51:00.600 --> 51:02.360
-Shut up! Shut up!
-No!

51:06.800 --> 51:07.800
Basement.

51:07.880 --> 51:09.960
See if you can find a window,
or an open door or something.

51:17.400 --> 51:18.560
PENNY: I'm down here!

51:18.720 --> 51:20.080
I'm down here!

51:20.200 --> 51:21.200
Listen.

51:21.280 --> 51:22.600
I was trying to save you from him.

51:23.280 --> 51:24.640
From Jeremy. Please, don't say anything.

51:24.880 --> 51:25.880
Please.

51:31.160 --> 51:32.320
Shh...

51:39.480 --> 51:41.120
-I'm in here!
-Shut up!

51:41.640 --> 51:43.000
-Shut up!

52:19.880 --> 52:20.880
Penny?

52:34.720 --> 52:35.720
Penny?

52:42.200 --> 52:43.200
Penny!

52:51.760 --> 52:52.760
Go!

52:57.080 --> 52:58.520
Where is Jeremy?

52:59.280 --> 53:01.080
Where is he

53:02.080 --> 53:03.520
Where is Jeremy?

53:03.680 --> 53:04.680
HALLIDAY: Boss.

53:04.880 --> 53:06.360
She needs medical attention.

53:07.880 --> 53:08.880
Come here.

53:14.640 --> 53:17.160
It's okay. It's okay.

53:24.920 --> 53:26.760
Come here. Stop. Stop. Give us a second.

53:27.280 --> 53:30.240
Look. Look,
you still have a way out of this.

53:30.480 --> 53:33.680
Okay, you got a very solid defence,
coercive control.

53:33.760 --> 53:36.520
You... You led your life in fear
of him, okay? So,

53:37.200 --> 53:39.480
Help me to find him.

53:39.760 --> 53:41.600
I will help you, I promise you that.

53:41.680 --> 53:44.880
I think you're in need
of psychiatric assistance, Officer.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.880
Get her out of here. Go on.

53:56.160 --> 53:57.560
We've put out an urgent appeal.

53:57.720 --> 53:59.440
His face is all over the media.
We'll find him.

53:59.600 --> 54:01.080
Not without her. Not in time.

54:04.480 --> 54:05.560
-JOHN: Ambulance.

54:07.560 --> 54:08.560
Jeremy Lake.

54:08.920 --> 54:10.960
He got away in an ambulance.
He must have. He must have.

54:11.040 --> 54:13.400
Call the paramedic cruisers
and see where they dropped him off.

54:13.520 --> 54:15.400
-He must have done a ride-along.

54:17.080 --> 54:18.880
Boss, I've got to take this. I'm sorry.

54:20.080 --> 54:21.080
Mark, what's up?

54:21.160 --> 54:22.920
MARK:  John,
I need you to come back here.

54:23.160 --> 54:26.160
Er, mate, I promise, as soon as I can,
I will, okay?

54:26.240 --> 54:27.240
No, right now.

54:28.760 --> 54:31.240
-I've got big problems, Mark.
-Well, I have a big problem here.

54:32.480 --> 54:33.680
JOHN:  Yeah, what?

54:34.520 --> 54:36.960
John, my girlfriend is on her way home,
I need you

54:37.120 --> 54:39.280
to get your friends out of here.

54:39.920 --> 54:43.160
Er, Mark, listen,
I'm at the office, okay?

54:43.560 --> 54:45.760
Erm, can you...

54:46.000 --> 54:48.160
I can't get out of that now.
Can I... Can I come back to you

54:48.240 --> 54:49.240
on this?

54:52.800 --> 54:53.800
When is that?

54:54.000 --> 54:55.280
JOHN: I don't know, Mark.

54:56.440 --> 54:57.440
Two, three hours?

54:59.400 --> 55:00.400
No, that's no good, John.

55:00.600 --> 55:01.600
Remember what

55:01.760 --> 55:03.800
she told you. If she sees you and Alice

55:03.960 --> 55:04.960
around here...

55:05.360 --> 55:06.440
JOHN: Oh, yeah, okay.

55:06.680 --> 55:07.680
Erm,

55:08.160 --> 55:10.440
I'm about to step
into an autopsy, all right?

55:10.600 --> 55:12.280
Can you give me two hours?
Can you do that?

55:18.520 --> 55:19.520
John.

55:21.320 --> 55:22.320
Yeah?

55:22.440 --> 55:24.640
Mark tried,
but he oversold the lies.

55:25.440 --> 55:27.480
But at least this way
we know where we stand.

55:28.360 --> 55:29.440
I have a message for you

55:29.720 --> 55:31.800
-from Mr Cornelius.
-I think I've got the message.

55:32.040 --> 55:34.280
Hmm. I'm going to need you here, John.

55:35.640 --> 55:37.080
Why, so you can kill everyone?

55:37.240 --> 55:38.240
Not everyone.

55:38.480 --> 55:40.360
Just you and Alice.

55:41.560 --> 55:43.560
Assuming you listen and do as I ask.

55:43.960 --> 55:45.640
Er, he's lying, John. Er, oh...

55:46.080 --> 55:47.200
JOHN: Listen to me,

55:47.280 --> 55:50.840
all right? I'll go to Cornelius.
I'll go to Cornelius right now.

55:50.920 --> 55:52.880
I'll hand myself in, all right?
You can do what you want

55:53.000 --> 55:55.320
to Alice, but you leave Benny

55:55.400 --> 55:56.920
and Mark alone. Do you understand me?

55:57.040 --> 55:58.640
PALMER: John, I need you to focus.

55:59.480 --> 56:01.760
You're not in control here.
This isn't a situation you can leverage.

56:02.280 --> 56:03.840
Listen to me, you piece of shit!

56:03.920 --> 56:05.880
If you hurt them, I swear to God

56:06.000 --> 56:07.720
I will rip your fucking heart out.
Do you understand me?

56:07.800 --> 56:08.800
I'm not here to listen.

56:09.520 --> 56:10.520
This isn't a dialogue.

56:10.840 --> 56:12.240
And now your friend is dead.

56:12.600 --> 56:13.600
John.

56:15.400 --> 56:17.560
Mark. Just stop.

56:17.840 --> 56:18.960
Just stop right now.

56:19.040 --> 56:20.040
Leave him be.

56:21.360 --> 56:22.600
None of this is his fault.

56:25.640 --> 56:26.640
Benny, right?

56:27.320 --> 56:28.320
That's right.

56:29.800 --> 56:31.000
You're killing yourself, Benny.

56:31.600 --> 56:34.400
Benny Don't you fuck...
Don't you

56:34.520 --> 56:35.520
say another word, Benny.

56:36.720 --> 56:38.480
Boss, I need you to kill
this prick for me.

56:38.560 --> 56:39.560
No, Benny! Don't

56:39.720 --> 56:40.960
-say another word, Benny.
-White.

56:41.480 --> 56:42.600
-6'1".
-JOHN: Benny.

56:43.120 --> 56:44.480
-Dark hair.
-JOHN: No.

56:44.720 --> 56:45.960
Brown eyes.

56:46.200 --> 56:47.200
Muscular build...

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
Jesus!

56:57.080 --> 56:58.960
Here. Now. No more chat.

57:00.200 --> 57:02.400
You... All right, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
No!
