00:57.100 --> 01:00.734
(whistling)

01:00.800 --> 01:02.000
(giggles)

01:02.066 --> 01:04.700
-What do you think?
-I can't decide.

01:04.767 --> 01:07.633
Oh, honey, trust me,
Martinique is perfect.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.867
It has everything,
and all the men speak French.

01:10.934 --> 01:12.700
What do the women speak?

01:15.233 --> 01:17.100
Rose, honey,
everybody speaks French.

01:17.166 --> 01:19.500
Well, then we can't go there.
I don't know any French.

01:19.567 --> 01:22.266
Oh, honey, don't worry. All
you need to know are two phrases,

01:22.333 --> 01:25.433
"yes," and "no,
your roommate can't watch."

01:28.934 --> 01:31.100
Well, I was thinking
maybe someplace like,

01:31.166 --> 01:35.500
like Williamsburg, Virginia,
or maybe Washington, D.C.

01:35.567 --> 01:38.300
-You're moving, Rose?
-Too bad.

01:38.367 --> 01:40.400
This would be touching
if I liked you more.

01:42.867 --> 01:44.667
I'm not moving, Sophia.

01:44.734 --> 01:46.934
The three of us are planning
a vacation together.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.300
Without me?

01:48.800 --> 01:51.900
Well, we were hoping
that maybe you'd stay here

01:51.967 --> 01:52.934
and watch the house.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.033
Why don't you take the house? I'll stay
here and watch the hole in the ground.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.967
Hello, everybody. Hi, Ma.

02:00.033 --> 02:02.166
Brooke Shields
takes her mother everywhere.

02:03.033 --> 02:04.900
She just found out
about our vacation.

02:04.967 --> 02:06.600
We thought you were gonna
tell her, Dorothy.

02:06.667 --> 02:08.700
Well, I was waiting
for the right moment.

02:08.767 --> 02:11.233
You know, like right after
we landed in New York.

02:11.900 --> 02:14.433
New York?
I want to go to an island.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.867
New York is an island.

02:15.934 --> 02:19.100
No, I mean someplace where swarthy
men who don't speak English

02:19.166 --> 02:20.800
rub oil all over your body.

02:20.867 --> 02:23.400
Great, then we can go
for a ride on the subway.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.967
-Stan's here.
-Oh.

02:27.033 --> 02:28.333
What is he doing here?

02:28.400 --> 02:31.667
He needs my signature on some
papers. I told him, stop by.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.734
-Where is he?
-I left him on the doorstep.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.867
I wanted the neighbors to see
what a <i>baciagaloop</i> you married.

02:39.433 --> 02:41.033
I'll be back in a minute.

02:41.100 --> 02:43.266
So, where is this vacation
spot you're going to

02:43.333 --> 02:45.500
-where they don't allow mothers?
-Look, Ma, please.

02:45.567 --> 02:47.867
We'll discuss this
after Stan leaves.

02:47.934 --> 02:49.000
What's to discuss?

02:49.066 --> 02:51.967
You're leaving me behind to guard
the house like an old watchdog.

02:52.033 --> 02:54.633
I hope a neighbor comes by
to give me fresh water.

02:58.533 --> 02:59.767
Hello, Stan.

02:59.834 --> 03:02.867
Dorothy, hello.
You look fantastic.

03:02.934 --> 03:05.633
Please, please, Stan.
No hugging, no kissing.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.066
Let's just do it
and get it over with.

03:07.133 --> 03:09.934
Sounds like the last few years
of our marriage.

03:10.433 --> 03:11.900
I wish it was that good.

03:13.567 --> 03:14.767
It wasn't that bad.

03:14.834 --> 03:17.033
No, you're right. The important
thing is that it's over.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.500
-Come on in.
-Hello, Sophia.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.734
So, did you bring
the young chippy with you?

03:23.166 --> 03:26.367
Ma, come on,
you're talking about his wife.

03:26.433 --> 03:28.066
So, did you bring the bimbo?

03:30.133 --> 03:31.900
Chrissy's back in Maui.

03:31.967 --> 03:34.934
I just came to sell
a piece of property

03:35.000 --> 03:38.033
that Dorothy and I bought when
we were in Miami on our honeymoon.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.166
Just sign on the last page.

03:40.233 --> 03:41.066
Read it first.

03:41.133 --> 03:44.100
The last time he had you sign
something, I ended up in a home.

03:45.734 --> 03:47.967
Relax, Sophia.
It's just a piece of property

03:48.033 --> 03:50.133
where Dorothy and I talked
about retiring someday.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.967
Wait a minute, Stan.
I can't sign this now.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.934
Oh, come on, babe.
I thought everything was agreed.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.433
But this has to be signed
in front of a Notary public,

03:57.500 --> 03:59.533
and don't call me babe.

04:00.133 --> 04:02.433
Darn! Can you meet me
at a Notary's tomorrow?

04:02.500 --> 04:04.767
-Do I have a choice?
-You're beautiful.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.367
I'll call you in the morning
and make the arrangements.

04:08.433 --> 04:11.500
So long, Sophia.
You're beautiful too.

04:12.967 --> 04:15.200
Why did I ever marry that man?

04:15.266 --> 04:16.734
Because he knocked you up.

04:29.133 --> 04:30.934
Why did I ever let that happen?

04:31.433 --> 04:33.000
'Cause he got you drunk.

04:35.867 --> 04:38.333
Why am I even discussing this
with you?

04:38.834 --> 04:40.433
Beats the hell out of me.

04:49.867 --> 04:51.367
You sure all you want is coffee?

04:51.433 --> 04:53.767
The corned beef here
is really primo.

04:53.834 --> 04:55.567
No. I didn't even want the coffee,

04:55.633 --> 04:58.567
and you were the one who said it
would be rude if I didn't join you.

04:58.633 --> 05:00.600
Besides, I thought the little woman

05:00.667 --> 05:03.867
had you eating things
like sprouts and roots

05:03.934 --> 05:07.600
and those green things
that grow under boats.

05:09.633 --> 05:11.300
Let's not talk about Chrissy.

05:11.367 --> 05:13.667
Oh, come on.
We've had a bitter divorce

05:13.734 --> 05:17.867
that time has softened
into a hostile relationship.

05:17.934 --> 05:20.900
I mean, face it, our topics
of conversation are limited.

05:20.967 --> 05:23.200
Come on, Dorothy,
we just sold a piece of property

05:23.266 --> 05:24.800
that we bought on our honeymoon.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.567
Don't you feel
a little sentimental?

05:26.633 --> 05:27.767
No.

05:29.066 --> 05:31.033
Come on, what do you say
we take a drive out there,

05:31.100 --> 05:32.100
take one last look at it?

05:32.166 --> 05:35.066
Oh, two hours in a car
with my ex-husband

05:35.133 --> 05:38.233
looking at a piece of swampland
that I don't even own anymore.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.400
Oh, Stan, you really know how
to show a girl a good time.

05:43.834 --> 05:45.066
She left me.

05:47.333 --> 05:48.500
What?

05:48.567 --> 05:50.767
Chrissy left me for a younger man.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.333
Younger than Chrissy?

05:55.400 --> 05:57.367
Where did she meet him,
Camp Snoopy?

06:01.767 --> 06:03.667
I didn't want to say anything.

06:03.734 --> 06:05.266
What the hell,
you deserve to gloat a little.

06:05.333 --> 06:07.133
I deserve to gloat a lot.

06:08.567 --> 06:10.767
But I can't.
I know what the pain is like,

06:10.834 --> 06:12.667
and I wouldn't wish it on...

06:12.734 --> 06:14.166
I don't know how
to finish that sentence.

06:14.233 --> 06:16.000
I usually say "Stan."

06:17.934 --> 06:19.567
When did it happen?

06:19.633 --> 06:21.000
A couple of months ago.

06:21.066 --> 06:25.200
She told me she thought we were
no longer sexually compatible.

06:25.266 --> 06:27.734
Well, she didn't say it
in exactly those words.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.233
Of course, not. Those words
have more than one syllable.

06:34.433 --> 06:36.867
Anyway, she found some guy
with a few less miles

06:36.934 --> 06:38.500
on his surfboard,
and that was that.

06:38.567 --> 06:40.800
Well, I must say,
you're taking it fairly well.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.333
It's a front.

06:47.433 --> 06:49.333
You sure you're not gonna say,
"I told you so?"

06:51.934 --> 06:53.700
You're a good person, Dorothy.

06:55.800 --> 06:56.734
You want some?

06:56.800 --> 06:59.900
Ah, wonderful.
Half a pound of cholesterol.

07:00.400 --> 07:03.600
Are you sure you don't want to go
take a ride and look at our swamp?

07:04.533 --> 07:07.133
Oh, why not? I mean,
the day's shot anyway.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.133
Great. And after,
I can take you to dinner.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.233
How about that little seafood
place near the Fontainebleau

07:11.300 --> 07:12.367
where we were
on our honeymoon?

07:12.433 --> 07:14.266
Sure, why not?

07:15.133 --> 07:18.533
If memory serves me
correctly, the last time,

07:18.600 --> 07:22.233
we excused ourselves
before the main course

07:22.300 --> 07:24.767
and rushed back to the hotel.

07:24.834 --> 07:29.033
If memory serves me,
we rushed back to the hotel

07:29.100 --> 07:33.667
because you had the runs from
that cheap lunch you bought us.

07:38.300 --> 07:39.767
Oh, yeah.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.433
I don't care what Dorothy says,

07:50.500 --> 07:52.467
I'm not spending
my vacation in New York.

07:52.533 --> 07:54.867
It might be interesting.
I've never been to New York.

07:54.934 --> 07:56.567
You haven't, Rose?
I'm shocked.

07:56.633 --> 07:58.000
You're so cosmopolitan.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.300
Well, take it from me.
You're not missing a thing.

08:01.367 --> 08:03.867
The people are rude,
the streets are full of criminals,

08:03.934 --> 08:05.400
everything's overpriced.

08:05.467 --> 08:07.567
I don't know why Frank Sinatra
sings about it.

08:08.433 --> 08:10.100
New Yorkers are all sickos.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.834
We could go to Hollywood.

08:12.900 --> 08:15.467
Sure, good choice.
No sickos there.

08:18.533 --> 08:20.000
Sophia, honey, please.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.700
We're trying to make
a very difficult decision here.

08:22.767 --> 08:25.533
Oh, excuse me.
Not only am I not allowed to go,

08:25.600 --> 08:27.266
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

08:27.333 --> 08:30.033
This is the same deal
Cinderella had with her stepsisters.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.633
I've always wanted
to go to Hollywood.

08:34.700 --> 08:38.166
When I was a young girl, I used to
dream about becoming a movie star.

08:38.233 --> 08:40.400
Mr. Mason, who owned
the corner drugstore,

08:40.467 --> 08:43.367
said I was a young
Barbara Billingsley.

08:46.266 --> 08:48.700
So when I turned 17,

08:48.767 --> 08:52.166
I told my father that I wanted
to take acting lessons.

08:52.233 --> 08:54.567
What did he say?

08:55.700 --> 08:56.767
No.

08:58.533 --> 09:01.433
Great story, Rose.
But you know what?

09:01.500 --> 09:03.066
Hollywood's not a bad idea.

09:03.133 --> 09:05.700
What do you say? Should we tell Dorothy
we want to go to Hollywood?

09:05.767 --> 09:07.266
Why don't we?
Soon as she gets up.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.333
-Hey, to Hollywood.
-To Hollywood.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.533
Morning.

09:22.934 --> 09:25.667
I guess you ladies didn't recognize
me without my toupee.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.333
I guess that's it.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.734
Do you mind if I use the phone?

09:30.800 --> 09:33.500
You already used my daughter.
You didn't ask for my permission.

09:36.533 --> 09:38.266
There's a phone
in the living room.

09:38.333 --> 09:39.433
Thanks.

09:40.166 --> 09:41.367
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:42.767 --> 09:46.100
Ok, I know what it looks like,
and frankly...

09:46.734 --> 09:48.967
that's exactly what it is.

09:49.033 --> 09:50.266
You had to bring him home?

09:50.333 --> 09:52.767
You couldn't find a drunken sailor
on a street corner?

09:54.233 --> 09:56.500
We're a little surprised,
that's all.

09:56.567 --> 09:57.834
You're not alone.

09:57.900 --> 10:00.900
It was the last thing
in the world I expected.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.934
I met him,
we went to sign the papers,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.100
we had lunch,
he told me his wife left him...

10:05.166 --> 10:08.133
And you believed him? That is
the oldest line in the book.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.800
I hear that at least twice a week.

10:09.867 --> 10:11.500
And it works every time.

10:13.133 --> 10:15.967
I said it was old.
I didn't say it doesn't work.

10:16.033 --> 10:21.033
No, believe me, Chrissy left him.
He was devastated.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.734
Next thing I knew,
I was holding him,

10:22.800 --> 10:24.300
he was crying,
we were in bed.

10:24.367 --> 10:26.667
It was just as it always had been.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.867
Well, I'm shocked.

10:29.934 --> 10:32.700
I was too. You know Chrissy
didn't teach him a thing?

10:37.266 --> 10:39.467
Well, if he's moving in,
I'm moving out.

10:39.533 --> 10:41.300
He is not moving in, Ma.

10:41.367 --> 10:43.633
We are not getting back together.

10:43.700 --> 10:46.700
It was just one night
with a comfortable stranger,

10:46.767 --> 10:49.767
and that's where it ends.
Believe me, we both know that.

10:49.834 --> 10:54.433
No, you heard me right.
Six dozen long-stemmed Roses.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.600
And the card should read,

10:55.667 --> 10:59.266
"to Dorothy
and a wonderful new beginning."

11:16.333 --> 11:18.934
Dorothy, we're gonna talk to
the travel agent about Hollywood.

11:19.000 --> 11:19.867
You wanna come with us?

11:19.934 --> 11:22.600
No, look, I'm sorry, but I am
not gonna spend my vacation

11:22.667 --> 11:24.867
sitting in a tour bus,
looking at houses

11:24.934 --> 11:27.900
that may or may not belong
to Lucille Ball.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.367
Well, I'm not spending
my vacation in New York

11:31.433 --> 11:33.300
getting mugged
and groped and insulted.

11:33.367 --> 11:37.066
I'll be happy to go anywhere
they don't spit on Americans.

11:37.133 --> 11:38.300
Why don't you come with us?

11:38.367 --> 11:40.867
No, I can't. Stan called.
He's stopping by.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.633
Oh, really? What's he gonna do,
bring you some more flowers?

11:44.467 --> 11:46.367
You know
what I don't understand?

11:46.433 --> 11:49.333
I don't understand
why he sent you flowers at all.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.800
I mean, two days ago
you hated each other.

11:51.867 --> 11:54.033
And you know what else
I don't understand?

11:54.100 --> 11:58.000
I don't understand how two people
who go off to a business meeting

11:58.066 --> 11:59.934
end up in bed together.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.367
And you know what else
I don't understand?

12:03.433 --> 12:06.467
I don't understand why you didn't
tell him this morning

12:06.533 --> 12:07.967
exactly how you felt.

12:08.033 --> 12:09.967
Is that is, Rose?
I mean, are you finished,

12:10.033 --> 12:12.734
or is there something else
that you don't understand?

12:13.767 --> 12:15.633
Well, actually, there is.

12:15.700 --> 12:20.000
I don't understand how a thermos
keeps things both hot and cold.

12:25.066 --> 12:26.166
Yeah, neither do I,

12:26.233 --> 12:28.800
but I'll tell you,
if ever I sleep with Mr. Wizard,

12:28.867 --> 12:30.333
I'll find out what I can.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.734
Oh, I'm sorry, honey. It's just...

12:32.800 --> 12:35.834
last night should not
have happened, but it did,

12:35.900 --> 12:39.033
and it obviously means more
to Stan than it does to me.

12:39.100 --> 12:42.333
I mean, right now,
he's hurt and he's vulnerable.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.934
Why didn't you tell him that
this morning?

12:44.000 --> 12:47.200
I was too shocked,
and I didn't know how to tell him.

12:47.266 --> 12:50.367
And to tell the truth, I don't even
know what I want to tell him.

12:50.433 --> 12:51.300
What do you mean?

12:51.367 --> 12:56.266
I mean that I am totally confused
about what I feel.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.867
(knock on door)

13:01.700 --> 13:03.467
-Hi, Stan.
-Hello, Stan.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.400
Blanche, Rose,
don't leave on my account.

13:05.467 --> 13:06.600
No, they have to.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.567
They're hitching up
the house to the car

13:08.633 --> 13:11.100
and entering it
in the Rose parade.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.500
We'll see you all later.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.033
Didn't you like the flowers?

13:24.100 --> 13:25.734
Oh, Stan, they're beautiful.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.567
They're just absolutely beautiful,
but I mean, it's too much.

13:28.633 --> 13:31.000
I know. I can't believe
how expensive roses got

13:31.066 --> 13:32.400
since the last time
I sent them to you.

13:32.467 --> 13:34.500
Yeah, well, everything's
gotten more expensive

13:34.567 --> 13:36.500
since Truman left office.

13:38.100 --> 13:41.734
Stan, listen, we really
have to talk about last night.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.100
We sure do.

13:46.667 --> 13:48.767
What do you say about us
getting back together?

13:48.834 --> 13:50.633
Come on in, girls.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.266
See, what did I tell you?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.000
Ma, what are you doing?

13:55.066 --> 13:57.233
I was having a meeting
with my vacation club.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.066
It seems there are
a lot of children

13:59.133 --> 14:00.900
who like to take vacations
without their mothers.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.300
What are you all doing here?

14:05.367 --> 14:08.734
They never heard of a woman going
to bed with her ex-husband.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.600
That's him, girls.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.700
I can't explain it, either.

14:15.233 --> 14:16.200
Listen, Stan,

14:16.266 --> 14:18.800
I think we'd better continue
our discussion in the kitchen.

14:18.867 --> 14:21.166
Sure, babe, beautiful, Dorothy.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.900
So you just want us to get right
back together again, right?

14:28.967 --> 14:32.900
Just like that?
I mean, Stan, we're divorced.

14:32.967 --> 14:36.200
Stan, you walked out on me.
You left me for another woman.

14:36.266 --> 14:39.667
Dorothy, I realize I may be
rushing things, but think about it.

14:39.734 --> 14:43.533
We had 38 years together.
A lot of it was good.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.867
I can't believe one stupid mistake
on my part could undo all of that.

14:46.934 --> 14:50.500
Well, believe it.
It was one hell of a stupid mistake.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.734
Was I the first guy to ever
go through a mid-life crisis

14:53.800 --> 14:54.900
and react that way?

14:54.967 --> 14:56.367
Probably not.

14:56.433 --> 14:58.767
But you were the first one
I was married to.

14:59.734 --> 15:02.200
Dorothy, Dorothy, hear me out.

15:02.266 --> 15:03.800
I know what you're thinking.

15:03.867 --> 15:06.667
That last night really
didn't mean anything,

15:06.734 --> 15:08.200
but you're wrong.

15:08.266 --> 15:10.233
The fact that it happened at all

15:10.300 --> 15:13.467
proves that there's still
something between us,

15:13.533 --> 15:14.333
and now...

15:15.233 --> 15:17.100
we've got a chance
to start all over.

15:18.266 --> 15:20.700
We could take that cruise
we always talked about.

15:21.533 --> 15:24.967
We could look into that antique shop
you always wanted to open.

15:25.900 --> 15:27.633
We could stop the sale
of that property

15:27.700 --> 15:30.367
and finally build the home
we always dreamed of.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.834
There are so many things that
we can do together, Dorothy.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.066
So many things
you can't do alone.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.166
Don't answer me right now.
Just think about it.

15:41.233 --> 15:42.033
Please.

15:43.700 --> 15:46.533
Please don't close the door
on the rest of our lives.

15:48.467 --> 15:49.734
I love you, Dorothy.

15:51.266 --> 15:54.233
Took me a while
to realize I always have.

16:10.133 --> 16:11.467
You shouldn't take him back.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.834
It's not just my opinion.
We took a vote.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.700
-Hey, what are you two doing up?
-Waiting for you.

16:32.767 --> 16:34.300
We thought
you might want to talk.

16:34.367 --> 16:36.100
All the food's already
on the table, Dorothy.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.033
We didn't want to waste
precious time.

16:38.533 --> 16:40.033
Thank you.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.633
So, what do you want
to talk about?

16:42.967 --> 16:45.934
All right, I have not decided
what to do about Stan.

16:46.700 --> 16:52.300
I mean... how can I just forget all
the time that we had together?

16:53.400 --> 16:56.200
And then how can I forget
the pain and the hatred

16:56.266 --> 16:58.133
that I felt when he left me? I...

16:59.600 --> 17:02.900
I can never trust him again,
and if you can't trust your husband,

17:02.967 --> 17:05.200
then what kind of
a relationship can it be?

17:05.266 --> 17:07.567
Sounds to me like you've
already made up your mind.

17:07.633 --> 17:09.233
I guess I have.

17:09.300 --> 17:13.734
Yeah, I just didn't know
it until just now.

17:14.834 --> 17:18.567
Oh, I wish there was some
gentle way to tell him.

17:18.633 --> 17:19.867
Oh, take it from me, honey.

17:19.934 --> 17:22.934
There is no gentle way
to end it with a man.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.433
When you're gentle with them,
they just don't get the message.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.100
Oh, Blanche is so right,
Dorothy.

17:28.166 --> 17:31.000
That was exactly the problem
I had with Eddie Parker.

17:31.066 --> 17:34.300
He was this real sweet guy
who was crazy about me,

17:34.367 --> 17:37.734
but I just didn't feel
the same way about him.

17:38.533 --> 17:41.500
You see,
when Charlie went off to war,

17:41.567 --> 17:44.500
I went to work
for our local USO club.

17:45.734 --> 17:49.834
And that's where I first met
Eddie, the aqua midget.

17:54.667 --> 17:55.967
He was a blue midget?

17:58.300 --> 18:00.934
Don't be ridiculous.
He was a diving midget.

18:01.900 --> 18:04.600
That was his act.
He used to jump off a step ladder

18:04.667 --> 18:07.600
into this gigantic punch bowl.

18:11.767 --> 18:12.567
So...

18:14.133 --> 18:15.100
what happened?

18:15.166 --> 18:18.066
Nothing. He'd just swim
to the side and hop out.

18:20.967 --> 18:24.934
I mean, what happened
between you and Eddie?

18:25.433 --> 18:29.567
We talked a lot between shows
and, of course, I didn't realize it,

18:29.633 --> 18:31.467
but he was falling for me.

18:31.533 --> 18:33.033
Didn't have far to fall.

18:38.400 --> 18:42.233
-It started with little things.
-I'll bet.

18:48.066 --> 18:50.734
Pretty soon the situation
got out of control,

18:50.800 --> 18:54.266
and I tried to let him down gently.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.633
You tried to make it
short and sweet?

19:03.667 --> 19:06.700
He just wouldn't take no
for an answer.

19:07.567 --> 19:09.800
So I finally just had
to tell him straight out

19:09.867 --> 19:13.600
that I didn't feel about him
the way he felt about me.

19:13.667 --> 19:15.800
It had nothing to do with his size.

19:15.867 --> 19:21.133
It was simply that I could never
become seriously involved

19:21.200 --> 19:23.133
with anybody in show business.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.934
Thank you, Rose.

19:33.533 --> 19:35.166
I don't know what to say.

19:37.066 --> 19:39.734
And I mean that
from the bottom of my heart.

19:52.166 --> 19:53.700
(knock on door)

19:58.800 --> 20:00.467
-Hi.
-Hello, Stan.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.300
Come on in.
I ordered up some refreshments.

20:03.367 --> 20:05.400
After all,
this calls for a celebration.

20:05.467 --> 20:06.834
Oh, what are we celebrating?

20:06.900 --> 20:09.200
The fact that you got free champagne
with your room?

20:10.767 --> 20:14.066
We are celebrating
what you said on the phone.

20:14.133 --> 20:15.834
Oh, what did I say?

20:15.900 --> 20:19.333
You said... (dramatically)
"Stanley, Stanley,

20:19.400 --> 20:22.567
could I come to your hotel room?
I have to see you."

20:22.633 --> 20:24.800
Mm, no,
that's not what I said.

20:24.867 --> 20:26.700
I said... (matter-of-factly)
"Stanley, Stanley,

20:26.767 --> 20:29.767
could I come to your hotel room?
I have to see you."

20:29.834 --> 20:30.867
Exactly.

20:31.867 --> 20:33.867
Here you go, Dorothy.
How about a toast?

20:33.934 --> 20:36.166
Look, slow down, Stan.

20:36.233 --> 20:38.233
There are a couple of things
I'd like to say.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.900
Ok, but usually the man
makes the toast.

20:41.934 --> 20:42.834
Stanley, I...

20:42.900 --> 20:43.900
-(knock on door)
-One second.

20:43.967 --> 20:46.266
That must be my socks and underwear
coming back from the laundry.

20:46.333 --> 20:48.900
That is one of the biggest drawbacks
of being without a wife.

20:51.367 --> 20:52.266
Chrissy!

20:52.333 --> 20:53.967
Chrissy?

20:54.033 --> 20:56.133
I had to talk to you, big Stan.

20:57.133 --> 20:58.834
Why didn't you
return my phone calls?

20:58.900 --> 21:01.300
I... there's nothing
to talk about, Chrissy.

21:01.367 --> 21:03.200
Big Stan?

21:04.300 --> 21:05.433
Who's she?

21:05.500 --> 21:07.834
Oh, sorry.
This is my ex-wife, Dorothy.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.767
Dorothy, this is my
soon-to-be ex-wife, Chrissy.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.367
Hi.

21:12.433 --> 21:14.200
I want you back, stick man.

21:14.266 --> 21:16.133
I need you back.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.400
I was so wrong to think
I'd be happier with Jean Paul.

21:19.467 --> 21:21.266
I realize that now.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.066
I can't spend another night
without you

21:23.133 --> 21:26.300
in that big, empty, lonely,
solar-heated waterbed.

21:29.100 --> 21:32.033
No need to say a word.
I understand.

21:32.100 --> 21:34.433
-Here you go, honey.
-Dorothy, wait.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.367
Chrissy,
there is nothing to discuss.

21:36.433 --> 21:38.467
Oh, but, stick man.

21:41.734 --> 21:44.767
I mean, the girl flew
all the way from Maui.

21:44.834 --> 21:47.767
Oh, that's all right.
I'm a stewardess. I fly for free.

21:47.834 --> 21:50.367
I know, but the thought
should count for something.

21:50.433 --> 21:53.300
Chrissy, something
happened here in Miami,

21:53.367 --> 21:54.900
something that changed
the way I feel.

21:54.967 --> 21:56.533
Listen, Stanley.
You know, before you--

21:56.600 --> 21:58.467
Dorothy, Dorothy,
don't be embarrassed.

21:58.533 --> 22:01.000
Chrissy deserves to hear the truth.

22:03.300 --> 22:05.767
It's all over between us, Chrissy.

22:05.834 --> 22:08.033
This is the woman I love.

22:08.100 --> 22:11.233
Seeing Dorothy again made me
realize how superficial

22:11.300 --> 22:13.233
my relationship with you
really was.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.200
Sure, the sex was great.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.633
Terrific, actually.

22:19.567 --> 22:22.700
But it's ok with Dorothy too.

22:25.433 --> 22:27.734
And with Dorothy,
there is so much more.

22:28.233 --> 22:29.667
I'm sorry, Chrissy.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.934
There's nothing left for us.

22:33.533 --> 22:36.233
The fact is, there wasn't
that much there to begin with.

22:40.367 --> 22:42.100
She never could
hold her liquor.

22:44.433 --> 22:45.300
Uhm...

22:45.834 --> 22:47.567
Stan, did you
really mean what you said

22:47.633 --> 22:50.200
about there not being that much
between you and Chrissy?

22:50.266 --> 22:51.900
-That's right.
-I'm glad.

22:51.967 --> 22:54.967
-Because now I don't feel so guilty.
-What are you talking about?

22:55.033 --> 23:00.567
Stanley, I don't feel the
same way about us as you do.

23:00.633 --> 23:02.633
-You're kidding.
-No. You know,

23:02.700 --> 23:05.934
what happened the other night
brought back lovely memories,

23:06.000 --> 23:09.333
but I'm not the same woman
you walked out on two years ago.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.033
My whole life has changed,

23:11.100 --> 23:13.367
and quite frankly,
I like the way it is.

23:13.433 --> 23:17.133
-The fact that I'm on my own now...
-My God, Dorothy.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.934
Are you saying
you won't take me back?

23:20.000 --> 23:23.800
Well, we could never have things
the way we used to have, Stan--

23:23.867 --> 23:26.467
You're telling me that
you're not gonna take me back?

23:26.533 --> 23:28.200
Yes, Stanley, that's right.

23:28.266 --> 23:29.900
Let me get this straight.

23:31.633 --> 23:33.033
You're definitely not
gonna take me back?

23:33.100 --> 23:34.667
Look, Stanley, I'm sorry--

23:34.734 --> 23:36.100
I'd like to hear the rest of this,

23:36.166 --> 23:38.100
but I've gotta get down to
the lobby and grab Chrissy

23:38.166 --> 23:40.133
before somebody else does.

23:43.767 --> 23:46.867
Hey, terrific sex
is better than nothing.

23:49.400 --> 23:53.166
Well... here's to terrific sex.

23:53.967 --> 23:57.166
And the dumb blonde
who's not gonna get any.
