01:17.040 --> 01:20.794
Al, why isn't anything happening?

01:21.000 --> 01:24.709
It will, you just have to be patient.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.197
Well, I don't want to be
disappointed again.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.872
Any minute now, trust me.

01:34.480 --> 01:37.119
I know how this works.

01:40.240 --> 01:45.030
Al, you did it.
You did pay the electric bill.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.756
Of course.
Happy anniversary, baby.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.399
Thank you, Al.

01:55.600 --> 01:59.798
It's the perfect present
for the gal who already has nothing.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.391
Now, is there something
I can do for you?

02:02.600 --> 02:06.149
Yeah. Get in position, baby.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.594
Oh, Al.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.838
I can still feel you, Peg.

02:20.880 --> 02:25.351
- I love you, Al.
- Yeah, thanks.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.714
Hey, Mom, Dad.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.953
Kids, don't just burst in like that.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.674
What if we'd been doing
something intimate?

02:41.920 --> 02:43.638
No, we have to turn on
the television.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.229
That lady Coco's on.
The one with the beauty empire.

02:46.440 --> 02:48.635
Yeah, she said
she graduated from Polk High.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.110
Supposed to be the most
famous Polk High graduate.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.955
The second most famous graduate.

02:55.160 --> 02:59.711
I don't think this Coco broad scored
four touchdowns in a single game.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.353
Or would have played pro ball
if it wasn't for a bum knee...

03:07.560 --> 03:10.120
...and an even bummer wife.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.238
Oh, there she is.

03:13.480 --> 03:17.758
<i>I have to say, you look great.
Would you stand up for us?</i>

03:23.120 --> 03:26.795
<i>So you attained this perfection by
dieting and using your own products.</i>

03:27.000 --> 03:28.228
<i>I'm very lucky.</i>

03:28.440 --> 03:31.830
<i>I can eat anything I want
and then get it all suck ed out.</i>

03:32.040 --> 03:34.998
<i>But my beauty products
are just as good as surgery...</i>

03:35.200 --> 03:38.397
<i>...and the money goes to me.</i>

03:41.440 --> 03:44.432
Oh, my God, I recognize her.

03:44.640 --> 03:50.033
Her name isn't Coco,
it's Helen Granowitter.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.990
Peg, you remember her, she was
a year behind us in high school.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.670
I don't remember her.
You really know her, Al?

03:57.880 --> 04:00.474
Well, I don't want to say anything
in front of the kids...

04:05.080 --> 04:09.676
<i>...but she co-piloted the starship Bundy
a couple of seasons.</i>

04:14.120 --> 04:16.918
What do you think
of your old dad now?

04:19.519 --> 04:20.714
What?

04:20.959 --> 04:22.234
Oh, come on, Dad.

04:22.440 --> 04:25.591
You never had
a beautiful woman in your whole life.

04:28.560 --> 04:32.394
Seriously, Mom. Could you picture Dad
with even a mildly attractive woman?

04:34.240 --> 04:36.276
Really, Mom. Look at him.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.031
What kind of woman
do you think he possibly could get?

04:43.000 --> 04:46.709
You didn't let me finish.
I was gonna say, " He's got you...

04:46.920 --> 04:49.753
...so why would he want
a beautiful woman?"

04:50.520 --> 04:52.351
Get out.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.957
What did I do?
I was just insulting Daddy.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.433
They hear what they wanna hear.

05:00.520 --> 05:04.399
Hey, somebody stop that guy,
he stole my lunch!

05:28.800 --> 05:30.677
Oh, my.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.394
Hi, beautiful.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.551
Hi, baby.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.558
It's...

05:52.520 --> 05:56.718
...just soda. It'll dry soon
and leave a little stain.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.753
Well, let's cut the charade.
We both know why you're here.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.150
Why are you here?

06:04.040 --> 06:06.508
I've travelled the world
trying to find a man...

06:06.720 --> 06:09.871
...that can satisfy me
the way you did.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.956
Wait a second, wait a second.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.435
Something's going on in here.
Wait a minute.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.195
Oh, it's just an ice cube.
I thought I was passing a stone.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.149
God, you're a pig.

06:31.720 --> 06:35.759
I love it. I want you, Al.
Travel the world with me.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.635
Make love to me
the way that only you can.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.312
- Excuse me, I-
- Get out!

06:50.920 --> 06:53.912
- So you were saying?
- I want you.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.879
Well, I wish
I could say I was shocked...

06:57.360 --> 06:59.237
...and dry.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.871
Look, I-

07:06.240 --> 07:08.071
I know I look
much the same as I did...

07:08.280 --> 07:11.158
...when I was a strapping,
sexy high school football star, but-

07:11.360 --> 07:14.158
So it doesn't surprise me
when you say you want me, but-

07:15.200 --> 07:18.078
Look closely
in the dead that are my eyes.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.191
You'll see I'm married.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.234
I'm sorry to hear it.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.755
I'm sorry to say it.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.517
But would you come home
and meet my family?

07:28.720 --> 07:32.315
You know, tell them you know me.
You know, the sex stuff.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.508
I'd like to impress the kids,
you know.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.918
Sure.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.551
Good. I want you
to come home for dinner.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.552
We're having pizza.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.796
You bring it.

07:49.920 --> 07:54.914
So you are telling us that Coco,
world-famous millionaire...

07:55.120 --> 07:59.796
...is madly in love with you
and bringing us a pizza.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.395
It's not as hard to believe
as that I could've had...

08:04.600 --> 08:07.398
...a beautiful millionaire and
instead ended up with you.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.355
Lucky, huh?

08:18.080 --> 08:20.913
Hello, Coco.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.310
I'm so happy to see you.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.395
Coco, meet the family.

09:00.680 --> 09:03.114
Hey, you guys
have to touch these stockings.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.039
I think they're really
made out of silk.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.711
I'm not wearing stockings.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.233
Come with us
into our formal dining room.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.668
I told you extra cheese.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.553
I never met a woman
could order a pizza right. Extra cheese.

09:24.760 --> 09:25.988
How tough is it?

09:27.240 --> 09:31.552
- You have a lovely home.
- Yeah, right.

09:31.800 --> 09:35.110
Enough meaningless girl small-talk.

09:37.800 --> 09:41.031
Tell her about the legend
of Al Bundy.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.119
Tell them about OCD...

09:44.640 --> 09:47.359
...One Cool Dude.

09:50.560 --> 09:54.348
Al, you have a disgusting
piece of cheese on your chin.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.711
Everything tastes better
from Al's mouth.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.597
Catch me, Bud,
I think I'm gonna faint.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.677
Okay, Kel.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.639
Kids, please.

10:21.840 --> 10:25.071
Not in front of rich,
world-famous company.

10:25.280 --> 10:28.431
Coco- And I think I can call you
by your first name...

10:28.640 --> 10:32.110
...since you just ate
off my husband's chin.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.796
tell me, why are you here?

10:35.040 --> 10:38.999
Because no one has ever
satisfied me like your husband.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.356
Catch me, Bud,
I think I'm gonna faint.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.111
Okay, Kel.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.195
I'll put this as plainly as I can.

10:58.400 --> 11:03.474
I've still got the hots for the big lug,
and I want to buy him from you.

11:17.520 --> 11:21.991
So let me get this straight.
You wanna buy him?

11:22.200 --> 11:24.953
He's all that's missing in my life.

11:25.160 --> 11:28.118
Well, he's missing
in everybody's life.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.356
But nobody wants to buy him.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.990
Now, wait a second. I think
we're missing what's important here.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.555
You people are treating me
like a piece of meat...

11:36.760 --> 11:39.911
...and I must say that I like it.

11:45.480 --> 11:49.553
I'm sorry, girls,
I think I dropped a nickel.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.518
Oh, my God.

11:55.760 --> 11:59.309
I thought the moon
was made of green cheese, and it is.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.118
Jealous little ironing board.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.589
Hey, you're Coco, aren't you?

12:07.800 --> 12:10.360
I buy all your products.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.755
You've been on parts of my body
even she hasn't touched.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.788
It's an honour to meet you.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.197
I write you checks
for a thousand dollars every month.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.597
I owe my man's softness to you.

12:24.840 --> 12:28.116
My man's softness comes naturally.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.788
I'm glad you're here.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.879
I'm being driven to the brink
of madness by my dry thighs.

12:37.080 --> 12:40.436
I cream, and I cream, and I cream...

12:40.640 --> 12:44.838
...but still my pants
wanna stick to my thighs.

12:45.600 --> 12:49.878
Perhaps you should let the cream dry
before putting on your pants.

12:53.920 --> 12:57.515
<i>I feel just like I did when I was
a little boy and my father said:</i>

12:57.720 --> 13:00.792
"Shake it, son,
and the women will pay. "

13:01.680 --> 13:03.557
You know,
we have 8 mm film...

13:03.760 --> 13:07.355
...of his father
fan-dancing for J. Edgar Hoover.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.878
Hey, she didn't come here
to talk shop.

13:12.080 --> 13:17.074
She came here
to purchase me as a sex toy.

13:21.360 --> 13:24.033
Oh, this is impossible.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.470
Someone wants you for sex?

13:26.680 --> 13:29.956
What, do you have
a pet orang-utan who's lonely?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.991
And not picky?

13:33.920 --> 13:37.469
Oh, I'm sorry. You two weren't
properly introduced, I don't think.

13:37.680 --> 13:39.477
This is Marcie,
our next-door neighbour.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.272
As you can see, she probably used...

13:41.480 --> 13:44.278
...some of your vanishing cream
on her breasts.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.988
See? Not a trace.

13:53.880 --> 13:57.714
Jefferson, pretend you're a man.
What are you gonna do about this?

13:57.920 --> 14:01.913
Well, I'm gonna do what every real man
ought to do for his woman.

14:02.120 --> 14:07.148
I'm gonna let the cream dry
before I put on my pants.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.318
Oh, yeah, I say the same thing,
but a celebrity tells you...

14:10.520 --> 14:13.114
...and you run, don't walk, to cream.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.949
- Suck-up.
- Bitch.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.512
Take me.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.309
You know, it could be worse.

14:31.720 --> 14:34.598
Our neighbours could have been
Siegfried and Roy.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.517
Let's cut to the chase.
I want to buy your husband.

14:39.720 --> 14:42.439
I'll pay you $500,000.

14:49.240 --> 14:52.630
Five hundred thousand dollars
for this?

14:52.840 --> 14:54.671
I don't get it.

14:55.280 --> 14:59.398
But then I haven't been getting it
for 20 years, so what's the difference?

15:00.600 --> 15:02.670
We can't sell Daddy.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.195
Mom, when you say "we"...

15:05.440 --> 15:08.955
<i>...I hope you mean " oui," as in French
for, " Hell, yes, we'll sell Daddy...</i>

15:09.160 --> 15:11.720
...and collaborate with the Germans. "

15:11.920 --> 15:15.629
Ergo- Which is French for,
"Yes, take our country...

15:15.840 --> 15:18.798
...but please let us live
to make our creamy sauces. "

15:19.640 --> 15:25.431
- I say we take the 500,000
and bid Daddy adieu.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.551
Which is French for a deer,
a female deer.

15:32.400 --> 15:36.188
So in closing,
I'd like to say one thing.

15:36.840 --> 15:41.277
S- E-L-L, sell Daddy!

15:49.480 --> 15:51.311
Dad...

15:52.720 --> 15:55.996
...take a long,
hard look at yourself, pal.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.714
You tell me what other possibility
there is out there...

15:58.920 --> 16:01.070
...for a man made of fudge.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.997
Snap out of it, man.

16:06.200 --> 16:09.556
Sell your worthless
damn body and soul.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.638
It's better than selling shoes.

16:13.880 --> 16:17.190
At least we'll finally be able
to tell people what you do.

16:17.800 --> 16:21.679
You'll be Al Bundy, male hooker.

16:24.040 --> 16:27.669
Now, Al, promise me
you won't do anything with Coco.

16:27.920 --> 16:31.833
Hey, she paid 500 grand.

16:32.040 --> 16:35.430
She wants the boodle, baby.

16:37.960 --> 16:41.350
Well, then promise me when you're
in bed with her, you won't enjoy it.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.552
Because I think
I can assure you that she won't.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.758
Honey, this is a wonderful thing
you're doing for your family.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.190
I want you to know
we're all very proud of you.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.396
Mom, the limo's here.

16:52.640 --> 16:57.509
Oh, Al, that's our limo
to take us to our new lakeshore condo.

16:57.720 --> 17:02.350
Well, honey, don't be a stranger.
You know where we live.

17:02.560 --> 17:06.758
Well, actually you don't. Oh, well.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.518
Gee, I'll miss you, Al.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.627
I'll miss you too, Peg.

17:24.760 --> 17:27.593
Well, goodbye.

17:32.440 --> 17:36.319
Oh, why, oh, why
was I cursed with these good looks?

17:37.960 --> 17:42.715
This rock-hard body,
this " hold me" heinie.

17:44.360 --> 17:48.069
Face that's a homing signal
for hooters.

17:50.040 --> 17:55.512
You are one fine $500,000
piece of beef.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.832
Hi.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.393
I've waited a long time, Al.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.476
You...

18:27.680 --> 18:30.035
You're on my side of the bed.

18:32.520 --> 18:35.512
- What's the difference?
- I don't know.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.075
What if I roll out in the night
and get confused...

18:38.280 --> 18:39.998
...and go to the bathroom
in the hall?

18:41.120 --> 18:43.793
Okay. I'll move over.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.793
Here. Is this better?

18:53.280 --> 18:57.114
You got my pillow all warm.
I don't like that.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.393
Fine.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.194
Let's get down to business.

19:11.440 --> 19:14.318
You know, maybe you could
get me a glass of water.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.794
- Water?
- Yeah.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.879
Okay, in a glass
or on the front of your pants?

19:20.080 --> 19:23.959
We don't use glasses,
but a paper cup would be nice.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.992
It's just me.

19:27.480 --> 19:31.712
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
I just forgot a few things.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.873
He gets thirsty.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.353
He likes his pillow cool.

20:02.840 --> 20:06.799
Well, bye.

20:08.320 --> 20:13.030
Oh, and I don't believe
that you bought my pillow.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.794
Well, stud, giddyup.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.192
All right, get up.

20:27.400 --> 20:31.757
Get up!
That's my bed and my husband.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.673
Here's your check and get out.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.759
This isn't my check.
It's just a piece of paper.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.672
Gee...

20:46.520 --> 20:50.559
<i>...it's amazing how a page out of
the TV Guide can look like a check.</i>

20:51.880 --> 20:53.313
Here.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.876
Go buy yourself your own
ring-around-the-collar worker.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.954
This big lug is mine.

21:05.520 --> 21:09.229
It's times like this
I'm glad there's a Ben & Jerry's.

21:09.440 --> 21:10.759
You're gonna buy ice cream?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.798
No, I'm gonna
go buy Ben and Jerry.

21:23.320 --> 21:27.233
Gee, Al,
I hope you're not mad at me.

21:27.440 --> 21:30.512
I just couldn't stand the thought
of you with someone else.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.188
Even if it meant
we were gonna get rich.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.073
Well, I guess I couldn't
be with anybody else either, Peg.

21:36.280 --> 21:40.717
Even though she had more to offer
than you in every possible way.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.795
I guess we're just meant
to be together, huh?

21:45.000 --> 21:47.116
Yeah, I guess.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.760
You know what I wanna do right now?

21:50.960 --> 21:54.475
Yes, I do,
and it's exactly what I wanna do.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.719
I can still feel you, Peg.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.276
I love you, Al.

22:15.480 --> 22:17.357
Yeah, thanks.
