WEBVTT

00:18.000 --> 00:20.901
Oh, thank you, Arnold.
I can manage that.

00:22.972 --> 00:25.907
But I still don't see why you couldn't
wait a couple of weeks.

00:25.975 --> 00:27.966
Why go all the way up to Loki?

00:28.044 --> 00:32.344
To hear Grace Makanga speak,
and she won't be coming to Nairobi.

00:32.415 --> 00:34.474
I see.

00:34.550 --> 00:37.542
Oh, sweetheart, don't bother
to see us off. It could be ages.

00:37.620 --> 00:41.215
Okay, well—

00:41.290 --> 00:43.622
It's too hot to be standing around.
If you're sure.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.619
Bye.
Bye, Arnold.

00:50.099 --> 00:53.034
Let me take your bag for you.
Thank you.

00:53.102 --> 00:55.093
Bye, sweetheart.

00:55.171 --> 00:57.503
See you in, uh— in a couple of days.

02:36.105 --> 02:38.096
Sandy, he's here.

02:59.328 --> 03:02.661
Hi. Come in. Oh, hi, Sandy.
You caught me skiving, I'm afraid.

03:03.799 --> 03:07.132
How's Gloria? Well?
Gloria's fine.

03:07.203 --> 03:09.194
You haven't heard from Tessa,
I suppose?

03:09.271 --> 03:12.763
No, she's, uh, up north
with, um, Arnold Bluhm.

03:14.643 --> 03:17.237
Look, old chap, do you think you could
stop doing that a moment?

03:18.748 --> 03:20.739
Something wrong?

03:20.816 --> 03:23.444
She didn't say anything
about returning by road?

03:23.519 --> 03:25.453
From Loki?

03:25.521 --> 03:29.787
Well, that wouldn't surprise me,
knowing Tessa. I mean, I hope not.
Dangerous country.

03:29.859 --> 03:31.793
What is it, Sandy?

03:31.861 --> 03:36.298
We're getting reports
of a white woman, black driver,

03:39.335 --> 03:43.396
Found early this morning,
southern end of Lake Turkana,

03:43.472 --> 03:46.464
Dead—killed, it seems.

03:50.746 --> 03:53.078
You think it might be Tessa?

03:53.149 --> 03:57.415
Seems they hired a car and driver
in Loki and then headed east.

03:59.054 --> 04:01.113
They spent the night at Lodwar.

04:06.595 --> 04:09.086
They shared a room, Justin.

04:11.100 --> 04:13.830
The dead black isn't Arnold Bluhm.

04:15.504 --> 04:17.563
Most terribly sorry.

04:23.913 --> 04:25.904
And how sure are you?

04:27.183 --> 04:29.242
It's not looking good.

04:42.565 --> 04:45.500
It's...

04:45.568 --> 04:47.729
Good of you to tell me, Sandy.

04:50.439 --> 04:52.430
Can't have been easy.

05:04.787 --> 05:08.848
Diplomacy, therefore,
as we've demonstrated,

05:08.924 --> 05:14.055
Is the very map and marker
of civilization,

05:14.129 --> 05:18.725
Pointing nations the safest way
through country...

05:18.801 --> 05:20.769
Fraught with peril.

05:20.836 --> 05:22.770
And that's it.

05:22.838 --> 05:28.276
Uh, Sir Bernard Pellegrin has asked me
to convey his, uh, regrets...

05:28.344 --> 05:31.575
That he's been unable to deliver
his lecture in person.

05:31.647 --> 05:34.639
And I thank you on my own behalf
for your very kind attention.

05:34.717 --> 05:37.117
Thank you.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.116
Excuse me. Excuse me.

05:41.190 --> 05:43.454
Yeah? Yeah, sorry.
Excu— Excuse me.

05:43.525 --> 05:48.155
Sir, I've just got one question.
I just wondered whose map,
um, is Britain using...

05:48.230 --> 05:52.166
When it completely ignores the United Nations
and decides to invade Iraq?

05:52.234 --> 05:54.794
Or do you— do you think...

05:54.870 --> 06:00.274
It's more diplomatic to bend
to the will of a superpower...

06:00.342 --> 06:04.779
And—and politely take part
in Vietnam, the sequel?

06:07.716 --> 06:12.449
Well, uh, l— I can't speak
for Sir Bernard—

06:12.521 --> 06:15.422
Oh, I thought that's
why you were here.

06:15.491 --> 06:18.949
I mean, diplomats have
to go where they're sent.

06:19.028 --> 06:21.087
So do Labradors.
Ooh.

06:21.163 --> 06:23.495
- Ouch.

06:23.565 --> 06:25.965
Well, I think that, no, Sir Bernard
would no doubt argue...

06:26.035 --> 06:30.870
That when, um, peaceful means
are exhausted, then—
Exhausted?

06:30.940 --> 06:33.875
Mr. Quayle, they're not exactly
exhausted, are they?

06:33.943 --> 06:38.209
I mean, they're just— they're just—
No, they are just lying
in the way of the tanks.

06:38.280 --> 06:41.716
No, l-l-let's face it.
We've taken 60 years...

06:41.784 --> 06:46.517
To build up this international organization
called the United Nations,

06:46.588 --> 06:48.579
Which is meant to avoid wars,

06:48.657 --> 06:52.957
- and now we just blow it up
because our car's running out of petrol.
- Sit down, Tessa, for Christ's sake.

06:53.028 --> 06:55.155
- L— I think—
- Hold on a minute.
Let's see what he says.

06:55.230 --> 06:58.324
I think the questioner
is making a valid point,
and that a nation's foreign policy...

06:58.400 --> 07:01.665
- should not be determined
by narrow commercial interests.
- That's bullshit.

07:01.737 --> 07:03.898
That's bullshit.
You have to take responsibility.

07:03.973 --> 07:09.172
You are being paid to apologize
for this pathetic country of Britain,

07:09.244 --> 07:12.577
And he can explain to us why we've burned
our diplomatic credentials...

07:12.648 --> 07:16.584
And why we're killing, you know,
thousands of innocent people...

07:16.652 --> 07:19.416
Just for—just for some barrels of oil...

07:19.488 --> 07:21.683
And a photo opportunity
on the White House lawn.

07:21.757 --> 07:23.748
Why?

07:50.486 --> 07:53.546
Are you all right?
Yes, thanks.

07:55.591 --> 07:59.220
You were courageous.
No. No, I was completely rude.

07:59.294 --> 08:04.095
- It was just bad behavior, and l—
- You were impassioned.

08:04.166 --> 08:06.327
I'm so embarrassed. Sorry.

08:06.402 --> 08:08.563
Please don't be embarrassed.
I'm really sorry.

08:13.475 --> 08:18.913
And, uh, thanks very much.
You... tried to protect me.

08:18.981 --> 08:22.576
Very feebly.
No, you were—you were—
You weren't feeble. I just—

08:22.651 --> 08:24.710
Anyway, it was a very dull lecture.

08:24.787 --> 08:26.755
It was a dull lecture,
but even so I shouldn't have—

08:26.822 --> 08:29.916
Well, look, can l—
can I buy you a coffee or—

08:29.992 --> 08:32.654
I owe you a drink. Come on.
All right.
You can buy me a drink.

08:32.728 --> 08:35.492
I'm Justin, by the way.
Tessa. How do you do?

08:35.564 --> 08:37.555
Pleased to meet you.
Yeah, yeah.
Pleased to meet you.

08:37.633 --> 08:40.625
- You were quite scary,
but I don't blame you.

08:40.702 --> 08:42.693
It was absolute bollocks,

08:42.771 --> 08:45.501
So you're quite right to challenge—

08:45.574 --> 08:48.907
I'm rather nervous,
I have to confess.

08:48.977 --> 08:51.343
Me too. This way.

08:51.413 --> 08:54.007
Oh, do come in.

08:54.083 --> 08:56.517
Yeah, please. Of course.

08:56.585 --> 08:59.520
Thank you.
You lead the way.

08:59.588 --> 09:01.522
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Take a left.
All right.

09:12.434 --> 09:14.425
Wriggle.

09:29.585 --> 09:32.315
There we go.

09:37.626 --> 09:40.720
Thank you.

09:40.796 --> 09:45.165
For... this wonderful gift.

09:45.234 --> 09:47.395
How very generous of me.

09:49.104 --> 09:51.095
No, l—

09:55.410 --> 09:59.039
You—You're so—

10:00.782 --> 10:04.013
You know what I mean.
I know what you mean.

10:04.086 --> 10:07.419
I feel safe with you.

10:07.489 --> 10:10.515
I can imagine when you were six.

10:10.592 --> 10:12.583
You leading the revolution.

10:12.661 --> 10:15.027
No. No, I was very conventional.

10:15.097 --> 10:17.031
Here, Justin, put this on.

10:20.102 --> 10:22.570
Mr. Quayle? Please.

10:48.797 --> 10:50.788
Please.

11:14.590 --> 11:16.649
Know this lady, sir?

11:21.897 --> 11:24.627
Yes, I do. It's, uh—

11:24.700 --> 11:27.100
It's my wife, Tessa.

11:38.247 --> 11:40.238
Sandy.

11:44.419 --> 11:47.354
Come on.

12:23.058 --> 12:26.050
Tessa.

12:27.629 --> 12:29.961
My God, what a surprise.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.928
How'd you get in?

12:34.002 --> 12:35.993
Take me to Africa with you.

12:36.071 --> 12:39.006
What? Roll you up in a rug?

12:39.074 --> 12:41.065
Pack you in a tea chest?
Very funny.

12:41.143 --> 12:44.078
I'd have to smuggle you in
as illicit goods.

12:44.146 --> 12:46.637
I couldn't declare you.

12:46.715 --> 12:49.548
Oh, listen. I could put you
in one of these plant boxes, and—

12:49.618 --> 12:53.884
You'd be very comfortable
wrapped up in a little piece of, uh—

12:53.955 --> 12:56.219
I could label you. "Tessa."

12:57.659 --> 12:59.650
I'm serious.

13:03.932 --> 13:06.264
Um, yeah, I can see you are.

13:10.772 --> 13:15.038
And in what—what capacity
should I take you to Africa?

13:15.110 --> 13:20.241
I don't mind. You can take me
as your mistress, lover, wife.

13:20.315 --> 13:22.977
There's too much choice.

13:25.387 --> 13:27.446
L—Well, I'm—

13:29.224 --> 13:32.057
I'm flattered
that you would like—
No. No.

13:32.127 --> 13:36.063
Justin, please don't
say that sentence.
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

13:36.131 --> 13:38.429
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That's really—

13:38.500 --> 13:41.025
Just yes or no?

13:41.103 --> 13:44.129
Well, we—we hardly know
one another. I mean—

13:44.206 --> 13:46.071
You can learn me.

13:46.141 --> 13:48.735
Learn you?
Mmm.

13:54.316 --> 13:57.046
Yes or no?

13:57.119 --> 13:59.280
Then l—

15:06.621 --> 15:09.613
Oh.
A gift.

15:09.691 --> 15:12.159
Oh, thank you.

15:12.227 --> 15:14.821
Thank you.

15:16.131 --> 15:19.328
Thank you so much.
It's beautiful.

15:19.401 --> 15:22.234
- Hey.
- Arnold.

15:24.773 --> 15:27.537
That's so nice.

15:27.609 --> 15:29.873
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah.

15:29.945 --> 15:32.675
They made it for me.

16:10.952 --> 16:13.614
Hey, Mr. Bluhm.!

16:14.990 --> 16:17.185
Careful.

16:18.193 --> 16:20.991
Ooh. Take my hand.

16:25.033 --> 16:27.729
What did you give her, Arnold?

16:27.802 --> 16:31.067
Nevirapine. The government clinic
didn't have any again.

16:31.139 --> 16:33.198
Jomo.
Yes, Mama Tessa?

16:33.275 --> 16:35.869
Have you had your test yet?

16:35.944 --> 16:37.935
No.
Jomo.

16:38.013 --> 16:40.573
If she's H. I. V. Positive,
chances are you are too.

16:40.649 --> 16:42.583
Look, Dr. Bluhm, I really must go.

16:42.651 --> 16:44.778
We can talk about this later.
Thank you.
Take you 10 minutes.

16:44.853 --> 16:48.619
- Woodrow is very particular about time.
I will be in trouble. Bye.
- I'll see you later.

16:57.265 --> 16:59.256
Jesus!

16:59.334 --> 17:01.928
You shouldn't be
wandering around in this heat.

17:02.003 --> 17:04.995
Arnold, stop fussing.
You're as bad as Justin.

17:05.073 --> 17:07.803
If you were my wife,
I'd tie you to the bed.

17:07.876 --> 17:10.208
Then what would you do, Doctor?

17:10.278 --> 17:12.269
That's another story.

17:12.347 --> 17:14.975
Tell me what you'd do.
Hey!

17:40.609 --> 17:43.669
All right.

17:57.225 --> 18:00.626
Now, for the first time,

18:00.695 --> 18:03.528
We are exploring a new territory.

18:03.598 --> 18:07.056
This is a new discovery...

18:07.135 --> 18:09.933
For the famous marine biologist—

18:10.005 --> 18:11.996
Jacques Cousteau.

18:12.073 --> 18:14.473
You are a voyeur.

18:14.542 --> 18:17.409
It's fantastic.

18:17.479 --> 18:19.640
Now we are going down, down, down.

18:19.714 --> 18:21.841
Oh, what do we have here?

18:21.916 --> 18:24.476
Zoom!

18:24.552 --> 18:28.852
Wipe it.
I must keep this new discovery
for posterity...

18:28.923 --> 18:32.859
And admire the new person inside.

18:32.927 --> 18:35.088
You have to go wipe this.
Go and wipe it.

18:35.163 --> 18:38.064
Wipe it right now.
No, I can't wipe it.
I'm completely inept with computers.

18:39.134 --> 18:42.535
- I'm gonna keep it.
I'm sorry. I love it.

18:42.604 --> 18:45.937
Will you see who that's from,
darling?
Sure.

19:00.088 --> 19:02.921
What is it?
What?

19:02.991 --> 19:05.516
The e-mail.

19:05.593 --> 19:07.584
Oh, it's, um—

19:07.662 --> 19:09.926
It's just junk— some ad.

19:09.998 --> 19:13.399
- For?
- For the Nairobi Hilton.

19:13.468 --> 19:15.732
Oh, my boobs hurt.

19:16.805 --> 19:19.137
Would you, uh, mind, uh—

19:19.207 --> 19:22.199
Weekend package deal.

19:22.277 --> 19:25.940
Two nights for the price of one.
Mmm. Two guests
for the price of one.

19:27.582 --> 19:30.642
Sweetheart, would you come
and make yourself useful?

19:30.719 --> 19:32.710
Yeah, I'm coming.

19:55.410 --> 20:00.507
My darling. Sweetheart,
I'd like you to put this up
right in the middle.

20:00.582 --> 20:03.415
Right?
Yeah.

20:03.485 --> 20:05.749
So, um—

20:05.820 --> 20:07.947
Right there.
Mm-hmm.

20:08.022 --> 20:10.013
What do you think?
I think it's gorgeous.

20:10.091 --> 20:12.082
I think it's very tangled.
No, no, no.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.151
I meant— I meant
about a weekend at the Hilton.

20:14.229 --> 20:16.789
Oh, no. It's a bit flashy
for my taste.
Is it?

20:16.865 --> 20:20.801
Mm-hmm.
Oh. I wouldn't know.
L— I've never been there.

20:20.869 --> 20:24.669
Well, I have. I was there the other night
meeting someone with Arnold.

20:26.841 --> 20:29.241
Oh, well, just a thought.

20:33.414 --> 20:35.678
Sweetheart.

20:38.353 --> 20:42.187
Were you just inviting me away
for a dirty weekend at the Hilton?

20:42.257 --> 20:44.851
Mm-hmm.
Were you?

20:44.926 --> 20:46.917
I would love to,

20:46.995 --> 20:50.658
But maybe after... Arturo is born.
Oh, Tessa.

20:50.732 --> 20:52.859
We're not calling him
Arturo, please.

20:52.934 --> 20:55.232
Why not?
No. Not— Not Arturo...

20:55.303 --> 20:57.294
Or Giuseppe—
All right. Then what about...

20:57.372 --> 21:01.069
Garth— Daddy's name?
No, no. Come on.

21:01.142 --> 21:04.202
No, not Garth
or ditto Che or any—

21:04.279 --> 21:07.771
Che?
I just don't want any of these
mad, eccentric, hippieish—

21:07.849 --> 21:11.012
Che?
Alternative—
Yes, your revolutionary half.

21:11.085 --> 21:16.182
I think we should call him, in that case,
Che Muffin Quayle.

21:16.257 --> 21:18.248
Muffin?
Yes, the Quayle genes.

21:18.326 --> 21:21.989
Where do you get Muffin from?
No one's heard of muffins.
High tea by the jolly study fire...

21:22.063 --> 21:24.361
While the starving mob
burns London.

21:24.432 --> 21:26.923
Is that— Is that how you see me?
No.

21:27.001 --> 21:29.435
I see you buying the mob
fish and chips...

21:29.504 --> 21:31.495
While you wait
for law and order to return.

21:32.674 --> 21:35.905
And I love you the way you are.

21:41.082 --> 21:43.277
What about Arnold?

21:43.351 --> 21:45.410
What about Arnold?
As a name.

21:45.486 --> 21:48.216
Hmm.
Be such a nice gesture.

21:50.792 --> 21:53.852
Well, perhaps it'll be a girl.

21:53.928 --> 21:56.726
Mmm. I think it's a boy.

21:56.798 --> 21:59.460
I think it's a girl.

21:59.534 --> 22:02.196
You'd better get dressed.

22:02.604 --> 22:06.199
Move that tray.
Dry these glasses.

22:08.843 --> 22:13.610
- Can you open your windows, please?
Please get out of the car.

22:30.031 --> 22:32.829
Dr. Joshua Ngaba,
Kenya Health Ministry.

22:32.901 --> 22:36.428
Sir Bernard Pellegrin,
head of F. C. O. Africa desk.

22:36.504 --> 22:38.734
May I convey Her Majesty's
warmest greetings?

22:38.806 --> 22:41.832
I thought that Arnold
was going up-country.

22:41.910 --> 22:44.674
He is. Oh, don't worry.

22:44.746 --> 22:47.146
He's not gonna take me.
I've already asked him.
Hmm.

22:47.215 --> 22:49.706
Good. And, Tessa—
Yes?

22:49.784 --> 22:52.685
I'd be happier
if you stayed out of Kibera,

22:52.754 --> 22:54.745
At least until
the baby's born anyway.

22:54.822 --> 22:58.815
Um, just you wait until
I'm single again.

23:02.230 --> 23:04.562
Hello, Tim. How are you?
Hi.

23:04.632 --> 23:08.124
Are you struggling through
without Maude tonight?

23:08.202 --> 23:10.864
One of her party headaches.
I take mine standing up.

23:10.939 --> 23:12.930
Oh, how manly of you.
Isn't it just?

23:13.007 --> 23:14.941
Hello, Arnold.
Tessa.

23:15.009 --> 23:18.137
Hello, Ghita, darling.
Ooh, what a lovely sari.

23:20.715 --> 23:23.206
Interesting guests, Mr. Donohue.

23:23.284 --> 23:27.243
This is Kenya, Dr. Bluhm.
Seems only fair to invite the odd native.

23:27.322 --> 23:29.984
Mmm. The health minister's turn,
was it?

23:30.058 --> 23:32.219
So it seems.

23:32.293 --> 23:34.318
Who's that he's talking to?

23:34.395 --> 23:37.228
I have no idea.

23:37.298 --> 23:40.631
Thought your spies
knew everything, Tim.
Only God knows everything.

23:40.702 --> 23:42.897
He works for Mossad.

23:42.971 --> 23:45.064
You've met Dr. Ngaba, have you?

23:45.139 --> 23:48.267
Yes, at the opening
of a new state-of-the-art clinic...

23:48.343 --> 23:50.868
Without autoclaves
for sterilizing.
Mmm.

23:50.945 --> 23:53.004
Probably converted them
into a Mercedes.

23:53.081 --> 23:55.015
Hmm.

23:55.083 --> 23:57.017
I've never met an alchemist before.

23:57.085 --> 24:00.077
Tessa, darling.

24:05.126 --> 24:07.856
Ah, Tessa.
Hello, Porter.

24:07.929 --> 24:10.898
May I introduce Tessa Quayle,
Dr. Ngaba,

24:10.965 --> 24:14.059
The wife of our representative
for aid effectiveness?

24:14.135 --> 24:16.069
Pleasure to meet you.
How do you do?

24:16.137 --> 24:19.664
And this is Dr. Bluhm
from Médecins dans I'univers.
Good evening.

24:19.741 --> 24:21.606
Dr. Bluhm and I have met.

24:21.676 --> 24:25.339
Yes, it was at the opening for the clinic
that didn't have the sterilizing equipment.

24:25.413 --> 24:29.042
We never met, Dr. Ngaba,
but I know your work.

24:30.284 --> 24:33.447
Do you know Sir Kenneth Curtiss,
Chief Executive of Three Bees?

24:33.521 --> 24:36.718
- Yes, also by reputation.
Good evening.
- Good evening.

24:36.791 --> 24:40.227
Company here in Kenya.
We're very proud of him.

24:40.294 --> 24:43.058
And which of the bees are you?

24:44.932 --> 24:46.866
You were going to show us
the garden room, Porter.

24:46.934 --> 24:50.893
There is just one thing
that I'd like to thank Dr. Ngaba for—

24:50.972 --> 24:53.463
The free nevirapine.

24:53.541 --> 24:57.944
He's, uh, persuaded the manufacturers
to donate it to H. I. V. -positive mothers.

24:58.012 --> 24:59.946
It's a wonderful thing.
Shall we?

25:00.014 --> 25:02.744
The problem is,
it isn't actually reaching them.
Some, but not all.

25:02.817 --> 25:05.809
So we've been wondering,
is that a standard cock-up, Dr. Ngaba,

25:05.887 --> 25:09.152
Or— or were the pills converted
into the limo that you arrived in?

25:09.223 --> 25:11.885
I think that's probably enough.
If you'll come through here, Doctor.

25:11.959 --> 25:14.894
Justin.
Excuse me.

25:14.962 --> 25:18.796
You've gotta do something about Tessa.
Well, what would you
like me to do, Sandy?

25:18.866 --> 25:22.461
Well, she's embarrassing our guests.
Her and that bloody Bluhm.

25:22.537 --> 25:25.199
There'll be hell to pay,
I can tell you.

25:25.273 --> 25:28.401
Well, the— the squall
seems to have passed.

25:28.476 --> 25:31.070
If you can't control her,
you should keep her locked up.

25:31.145 --> 25:33.545
You're wanted on the veranda,
Mr. Woodrow.
Yes.

25:44.892 --> 25:48.259
Are so big here, they'll be best
towards the back of the border.

25:51.732 --> 25:54.360
Hey, sexy.

25:54.435 --> 25:57.268
You look divine.
Sandy, I think you're a pervert.

25:57.338 --> 26:00.171
Stop looking at me like that.
We're to have a baby in a week.

26:00.241 --> 26:03.142
Can I come and visit you
in the hospital?

26:03.211 --> 26:07.307
You want to visit me in Uhuru?
Uhuru? Tessa, you're not
having it there.

26:07.381 --> 26:10.179
Oh, Sandy, come on. Kibera women
have their babies there every day.

26:10.251 --> 26:13.015
It's perfectly safe.
No, it's not. It's madness.

26:13.087 --> 26:15.988
Just— Can I just choose—
Wait a minute. That looks a good one.

26:16.057 --> 26:18.184
Shall we run away?

26:18.259 --> 26:21.160
Yeah, come on then.
Take me for lunch.

26:25.199 --> 26:27.861
- I'm fine. Thank you.

26:27.935 --> 26:30.062
How are you?
I'm fine. Thank you. How are you?

26:30.138 --> 26:32.402
How are you?

26:32.473 --> 26:35.636
I'm fine. Thank you.
How are you?

26:35.710 --> 26:38.042
I'm fine. How are you?

26:41.249 --> 26:45.185
- Look, near the car.
- Jomo is getting a test.

26:45.253 --> 26:48.814
Of course. You told him to.
It was a suggestion,
not an order.

26:49.924 --> 26:53.485
- What are they carrying
in those little jars?
- It's probably saliva.

26:53.561 --> 26:56.394
But that's not how you test
for H. I. V. Here, is it?

26:56.464 --> 26:58.625
They're also testing for T. B.
Why?

26:58.699 --> 27:02.601
When they test for H. I. V.,
they also test for T. B. Free here.

27:02.670 --> 27:05.730
- What, just for free?
- A small extra service to humanity.

27:05.806 --> 27:08.240
They're a drug company,
Arnold. Come on.

27:08.309 --> 27:11.972
No drug company does
something for nothing.

27:12.046 --> 27:15.709
Is there... something
you're not telling me—

27:15.783 --> 27:18.217
Arnold?

27:55.656 --> 27:58.124
Hello, Sandy.

27:58.192 --> 28:00.353
I'm so sorry, Tessa.

28:00.428 --> 28:04.387
Gloria sends her sympathies.
What can one say?

28:04.465 --> 28:07.491
It was a boy.

28:07.568 --> 28:10.435
- Did Justin already tell you that?
- Tessa. Tessa.

28:10.504 --> 28:12.972
This one was born healthy though.

28:13.040 --> 28:16.942
Weren't you,
my beautiful, beautiful darling?

28:17.011 --> 28:21.778
His name is Baraka.
It means blessing.

28:21.849 --> 28:24.181
I... don't quite see.

28:25.219 --> 28:28.382
Who the mother is?

28:28.456 --> 28:31.516
Her name is Wanza Kilulu.

28:31.592 --> 28:35.084
She's 15, and she's dying.

28:35.162 --> 28:37.426
Kioko's 12.

28:37.498 --> 28:41.525
He walked 40 kilometers
just to keep the flies off
his sister and her baby.

28:41.602 --> 28:44.127
Perhaps that's the blessing.

28:44.205 --> 28:47.038
Darling, please don't.

28:47.108 --> 28:49.702
Please sit here, Mr. Woodrow.
I'll wait outside.

28:49.777 --> 28:52.337
Thank you.

28:52.413 --> 28:55.541
Kioko, here you are.

28:56.717 --> 28:59.277
You sweetheart.

28:59.353 --> 29:03.722
- Justin, my darling, could you please
go and get me a fresh bottle of water?
- Hmm? Sure.

29:07.628 --> 29:10.222
Now, Sandy?
Yes?

29:10.298 --> 29:13.028
If I tell you something,

29:13.100 --> 29:15.933
Will you listen to me?

29:16.003 --> 29:17.994
Not here, Tessa.

29:18.072 --> 29:20.836
No, Sandy,
if I tell you that that—

29:20.908 --> 29:24.901
That that girl over there
was being murdered,
would you believe me?

29:24.979 --> 29:28.312
Tessa, you're tired.
You're feverish.
No. No, I'm not.

29:28.382 --> 29:31.317
Now we haven't got all of the evidence yet,
but when we get it,

29:31.385 --> 29:34.718
If I bring it to you, will you—will you
actually do something for once?

29:34.789 --> 29:39.658
What you need is rest.
Now what I'm— I'm talking about
are coincidences.

29:39.727 --> 29:43.390
Tessa, you've got to stop involving yourself
in matters that don't concern you.

29:43.464 --> 29:47.958
You're embarrassing the High Commission,
and you're not doing Justin's career any good.

29:48.035 --> 29:51.766
Justin doesn't know what I do.
That doesn't surprise me.

29:51.839 --> 29:55.002
Sandy, you've got to promise me...

29:55.076 --> 29:57.977
That you're going to act
on what we tell you.

29:58.045 --> 30:00.513
We?
Me and Arnold.

30:08.856 --> 30:12.883
Please?
All right. I promise.

30:15.262 --> 30:17.856
Within reason.

30:17.932 --> 30:21.333
Within reason.

30:22.403 --> 30:24.871
Uh, there's a man.

30:30.378 --> 30:33.905
She's raving mad.
You've got to get her to a proper clinic.

30:33.981 --> 30:36.245
With white doctors,
Mr. Woodrow?

30:37.752 --> 30:42.212
For Christ's sake, Justin,
she's your wife.
Yes, she's my wife.

30:57.238 --> 30:59.502
You see, she's dead.

30:59.573 --> 31:01.507
What did you give her?
It doesn't matter.

31:01.575 --> 31:06.308
Dr. Lorbeer, you have got to stop
testing on patients with H. I. V.

31:06.380 --> 31:09.178
- It— Look at me.
- I have to go.

31:20.127 --> 31:22.595
Justin, stop the car.
Stop, stop, stop.
Why? What is it?

31:32.106 --> 31:34.597
Tessa.

31:36.010 --> 31:38.410
It's 40 kilometers to Miluri.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.812
It's gonna take them all night.

31:41.882 --> 31:44.476
We can't involve ourselves
in their lives, Tessa.

31:44.552 --> 31:47.043
Why?

31:50.624 --> 31:54.458
Be reasonable.

31:54.528 --> 31:56.894
There are millions of people.
They all need help.

31:56.964 --> 31:59.228
That's what the agencies
are here for.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.791
Yeah, but these are three people
that we can help.

32:01.869 --> 32:03.894
Please.

32:07.408 --> 32:09.399
Justin.

32:11.612 --> 32:13.671
I'm sorry, Tessa.
I have to put you first.

32:17.918 --> 32:20.045
I have to get you home.

32:34.602 --> 32:36.934
Probably got enough
there now, Mustafa.

32:37.004 --> 32:39.495
Yeah?
I think.

32:39.573 --> 32:42.406
Just the flowers this time, please.

32:42.476 --> 32:44.467
You can spare the weeds.

32:44.545 --> 32:47.378
The pest must eat too, bwana.
Yes, I know. If only they would.

32:47.448 --> 32:50.542
They can eat the weeds.
Look, you should be wearing gloves
with that, you know?

32:50.618 --> 32:52.609
And there's a mask
if you want it.
Okay.

32:52.686 --> 32:57.350
It's an outrageous thing. It's almost as if
it's a— it's a marriage of convenience—
Shh.

32:57.424 --> 33:00.416
Tessa.
And the only thing it's gonna produce
is dead offspring.

33:02.863 --> 33:05.297
I'm sorry to interrupt.

33:07.768 --> 33:11.363
- What the fuck is that?
- What?

33:11.438 --> 33:14.236
I said, what the fuck is that?
Tessa, it's pesticide.

33:14.308 --> 33:16.572
It— It's just unbelievable.

33:16.644 --> 33:19.477
Would you just get that thing
out of this house?

33:20.548 --> 33:23.608
Well, if you feel that strongly about it,
yes, Tessa— anything.

33:24.618 --> 33:27.951
It would help if you might explain to me
what's upsetting her.

33:28.022 --> 33:30.991
I mean, this doesn't kill people, does it?
Unless they swallow it?

33:31.058 --> 33:34.323
No.
What? Then can you tell me
why she's so—

33:34.395 --> 33:36.386
You have to trust her, Justin.

33:36.463 --> 33:38.954
It's hard, you know,
when she—we don't talk about—

33:39.033 --> 33:42.867
- Does she blame me for losing the baby?
- Of course not. Give her time.

33:42.937 --> 33:44.928
Tell her I'll be back later.

33:46.106 --> 33:48.267
Wherever there are drug companies...

33:48.342 --> 33:50.833
Testing their drugs on people
who they think are expendable,

33:50.911 --> 33:53.505
You'll find organizations like ours
trying to fight back.

33:53.581 --> 33:56.607
Of course, the problem is that they have
millions to spend on P. R...

33:56.684 --> 33:59.983
While we work with volunteers
and a few donated computers.

34:00.054 --> 34:03.319
If you're gonna dig deeper,
then most of us have Web sites.

34:03.390 --> 34:08.327
Check out Oxfam, M. S. F.,
Health Action International—

34:08.395 --> 34:11.125
Put it in here.

34:13.100 --> 34:15.762
Just mind the roses, please, Mustafa.
Hi, Birgit.

34:15.836 --> 34:20.102
Sorry. More questions.
Tessa never sleeps.
Always time for you, Tessa.

34:25.079 --> 34:29.140
Take care of yourself, Tessa, okay?

34:29.216 --> 34:33.016
I'm very tired. I'm sorry.
I can't translate that word to you.

34:33.087 --> 34:36.079
So you'd better ask that kind,
nice husband of yours—

34:56.543 --> 34:58.534
Okay. See you, Tessa.

35:04.918 --> 35:07.853
Hi.
Hi.

35:07.921 --> 35:10.788
It's bloody awful weather.

35:10.858 --> 35:13.383
You really shouldn't have waited up.

35:13.460 --> 35:16.258
Good. Then I think
you should go to bed.

35:18.666 --> 35:22.534
I'm safe home now, sweetheart.
No, you're drenched.
Look, take those wet things off.

35:22.603 --> 35:25.128
Tessa, come to bed
with me, please.
Yeah, l—

35:25.205 --> 35:28.834
I will, but there's, um, something
I have to do first. It's important.

35:28.909 --> 35:31.673
Tessa,

35:33.147 --> 35:36.310
Whatever it is
that you and Arnold are doing,

35:36.383 --> 35:38.715
I'd like it to stop.

35:38.786 --> 35:42.620
Wow.
Who have you been talking to?

35:42.690 --> 35:46.148
No one. These are
my concerns, all right?

35:47.227 --> 35:50.219
- I'm thinking of your health.
- No. No, you're not.

35:50.297 --> 35:52.788
They've asked you to rein me in,
and you're doing it.

35:52.866 --> 35:54.857
It's just unbelievable.

35:54.935 --> 35:58.530
What the hell are you talking about?
I hope you know me better than that.

35:58.605 --> 36:01.540
Your life is your own.
That was always our agreement.

36:01.608 --> 36:04.099
No. No, no. The agreement was...

36:04.178 --> 36:06.237
That my work was gonna be my own.

36:06.313 --> 36:08.304
That's what makes me who I am.

36:08.382 --> 36:12.318
I mean, if you stop me from doing my work,
then I am nothing. I'm just nobody. L—

36:13.520 --> 36:16.785
I'm not trying to stop you
doing anything.

36:16.857 --> 36:19.792
Please.
I'm sorry.

36:19.860 --> 36:22.522
I'm just tired. That's all.
Very tired.

36:22.596 --> 36:24.587
Then come to bed.

36:28.535 --> 36:31.129
Hmm?
Will you get me up for breakfast?

36:39.480 --> 36:41.641
I've got to finish my report.

36:43.317 --> 36:46.252
Just smash it like that.
Oh! Right.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.311
Now if you just put those there.

36:48.388 --> 36:50.822
You want probably to break them up
into smaller pieces.

36:50.891 --> 36:52.882
A bit more vermilion.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.929
Oh, you're just very blasé,
aren't you?

36:55.996 --> 36:59.022
You know, just through feel.
No, I wouldn't— No.

36:59.099 --> 37:01.158
I wouldn't call it a parasite, no.

37:02.836 --> 37:05.999
You're gonna be late for your match.
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

37:07.241 --> 37:11.541
Kenny, I can't discuss this on the phone.
wouldn't even give me an appointment.

37:11.612 --> 37:15.605
Time was you buggers couldn't get
your tongues far enough up my arse.
What's changed?

37:15.682 --> 37:18.674
Hi.
If I find out that this has got
anything to do with that bitch—

37:18.752 --> 37:22.415
Come to my office.
L— I've got to go, Kenny. Bye.

37:22.489 --> 37:24.582
Having trouble with Three Bees, Sandy?

37:24.658 --> 37:28.651
Just Kenny being Kenny.
Oh. Nothing to do
with my report then?

37:28.729 --> 37:31.857
Oh, he's just ranting.

37:31.932 --> 37:34.457
Oh, Sandy, you promised me
you were gonna do something.

37:34.535 --> 37:36.526
I sent your report to London.

37:36.603 --> 37:38.833
Really?
Yes.

37:38.906 --> 37:40.840
To Pellegrin?
Yes.

37:40.908 --> 37:43.001
And?
There was no official response.

37:43.076 --> 37:45.806
Well, what was there then?

37:45.879 --> 37:48.677
Well, just a personal letter. That's all.

37:48.749 --> 37:50.876
Saying?

37:50.951 --> 37:54.352
It's private.
What do you mean,
it's private?

37:54.421 --> 37:57.549
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.
I sent him an official document.

37:57.624 --> 38:00.889
I gonna have to call Pellegrin
and ask him.
No, no. Don't do that, Tessa.

38:00.961 --> 38:03.088
Why?
It's serious.

38:03.163 --> 38:06.997
You know me well enough to know
that I'm not gonna take no
for an answer. Come on.

38:08.168 --> 38:10.602
Tessa,

38:10.671 --> 38:12.662
I'm supposed to keep an eye on you.

38:12.739 --> 38:15.731
What?
Report where you are,

38:16.910 --> 38:19.174
What you're doing.

38:19.246 --> 38:21.407
Trust me, Tessa.

38:23.550 --> 38:26.041
This is something
that you should not pursue.

38:27.788 --> 38:31.849
I say that as a friend
who cares deeply for you.

38:31.925 --> 38:35.190
Sandy?
Oh, Tessa.
Hi, Gloria.

38:35.262 --> 38:37.594
Been wondering
where you'd got to.

38:37.664 --> 38:40.394
Darling, you know,
we really have to leave now.

38:40.467 --> 38:42.867
Match starts in half an hour.
Harry's got a cricket match.

38:42.936 --> 38:44.927
That is, you're still coming, right?
Yes, of course.

38:45.005 --> 38:47.269
You're not too busy, no?
One sec.

38:47.341 --> 38:49.332
Right. Okay.

38:49.409 --> 38:52.242
Justin's waiting for you in the car.
All right. Tell him
I'll be right down.

38:59.386 --> 39:01.616
Sandy, what do you think of me?

39:04.558 --> 39:06.617
I think you're beautiful.
Do you?

39:06.693 --> 39:08.627
Yes.
Really?

39:08.695 --> 39:10.629
Yes.

39:10.697 --> 39:13.666
Well, you can have me
if you show me the letter.

39:17.304 --> 39:19.295
Ooh.

39:25.212 --> 39:27.578
Are you serious?

39:27.648 --> 39:29.639
Yeah.

39:33.987 --> 39:36.148
When?

39:36.223 --> 39:40.182
Um, when I get back from Loki.

39:42.863 --> 39:45.024
Tessa,

39:45.098 --> 39:48.033
If anyone ever found out—

39:48.101 --> 39:51.036
I'd shown you the letter,
I'd be ruined.

39:51.104 --> 39:53.368
No one's gonna know, Sandy.

40:09.723 --> 40:11.987
Put it back in the drawer.

40:12.059 --> 40:14.550
Lock the drawer.
Put the key back.

40:16.296 --> 40:19.231
Read it at once.

40:19.299 --> 40:21.631
Promise?
Promise.

40:33.780 --> 40:37.716
My continent, Africa, is staggering...

40:37.784 --> 40:40.651
Under the weight of not one,
but three plagues.

40:40.721 --> 40:43.986
Yet still the governments
of the U. S. A. And Europe,

40:44.057 --> 40:47.754
At the behest of the pharmaceutical companies
that seem to control them,

40:47.828 --> 40:52.060
Drag their feet and continue
to give us endless reasons...

40:52.132 --> 40:58.037
Why we should buy your branded drugs
at five, 10, 20 times the price.

40:58.105 --> 41:00.437
Sweetheart, don't bother
to see us off. It could be ages.

41:00.507 --> 41:02.907
Okay, well, if you're sure.

41:07.114 --> 41:09.776
It's too hot to be
standing around.
Bye, Arnold.

41:12.986 --> 41:15.716
Let me take your bag for you.
Thank you.

41:15.789 --> 41:17.780
Bye, sweetheart.

41:17.858 --> 41:20.452
See you in, uh— in a couple of days.

42:26.827 --> 42:29.261
Tessa.
Tessa?

42:29.329 --> 42:32.662
Yeah.

42:32.732 --> 42:36.566
Inside a car and had been mutilated.
Turn it off, will you?

42:36.636 --> 42:39.366
Certainly. Sorry.

42:49.516 --> 42:51.575
Mr. Quayle.!

42:59.993 --> 43:03.554
- Mustafa.

43:04.865 --> 43:07.026
Mmm.

43:09.803 --> 43:13.364
Tessa's family.
- Yes.

43:13.440 --> 43:16.170
Police were here, bwana.
When?

43:16.243 --> 43:19.804
This morning. They took away
Mama Tessa's things.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.144
Better make a list
of what's missing.

43:22.215 --> 43:24.206
Mustafa.

43:36.963 --> 43:39.022
See? I told you.

43:39.099 --> 43:42.899
They took away the CD's,
the diskettes, the computer.

43:42.969 --> 43:45.699
They came here and took the—
the files, the papers.

43:45.772 --> 43:49.833
Just didn't want to touch anything
so that you can come
and see for yourself what they did.

43:49.910 --> 43:52.003
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, Mustafa.

44:22.576 --> 44:24.567
Dypraxa?

44:38.625 --> 44:40.616
Huh.

44:55.208 --> 44:58.939
Darling Tessa, you have hurt me
more than you know.

44:59.012 --> 45:02.470
Trusting you to be honorable,
I afforded you, against all the rules,

45:02.549 --> 45:05.609
An opportunity that you have abused
in the worst way.

45:05.685 --> 45:10.952
I beg you, for the sake of my career,
to return what you took.

45:11.024 --> 45:13.822
If you will not, then at least save
what is left of me...

45:13.893 --> 45:17.192
By chucking in your ridiculous sham
of a marriage, as I will mine,

45:17.264 --> 45:19.960
And bolting with me
to the end of the earth.

45:20.033 --> 45:23.025
I love you, I love you...

45:23.103 --> 45:25.094
And I love you.

45:25.171 --> 45:27.662
Sandy.

45:35.115 --> 45:37.845
I'm sorry to have been
so long, Sandy.

45:39.452 --> 45:41.682
Seems they've been in here too.

45:41.755 --> 45:43.689
Anything missing
in the bedroom?

45:43.757 --> 45:46.248
Her laptop's gone
and her disks and all her files.

45:46.326 --> 45:49.693
Yes. It's a mess.

45:49.763 --> 45:51.788
What's in that?

45:51.865 --> 45:54.663
Oh, uh, her will,

45:54.734 --> 45:57.726
Amongst other things.
Oh.

45:57.804 --> 46:00.295
Seems she wanted
to be buried in Africa.

46:00.373 --> 46:02.568
Oh.

46:02.642 --> 46:06.305
Darling Tessa. Hmm.

46:28.735 --> 46:30.999
Excuse me.

46:31.071 --> 46:33.562
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

46:33.640 --> 46:36.973
What are you doing?
Could someone please explain
what they're doing, please?

46:37.043 --> 46:40.410
Look, Justin, it— it's just concrete.
It's to keep the grave robbers out.

46:41.748 --> 46:45.240
Tessa expressed a wish to lie...

46:45.318 --> 46:49.220
In African soil,
not in bloody concrete.

46:49.289 --> 46:51.757
Nothing can grow in concrete.

46:51.825 --> 46:54.089
Kindly tell them to leave,
please, Ghita.

46:55.428 --> 46:59.262
And you too, please, gentlemen.
Thank you. It was kind of you to come.

47:27.627 --> 47:29.618
Hello.

47:29.696 --> 47:32.995
Kioko. It's Kioko?
Yes.

47:33.066 --> 47:35.762
You're Wanza's brother.
Justin.
Yes.

47:35.835 --> 47:37.769
You brought a card for Tessa?
Yes.

47:37.837 --> 47:39.896
You walked here?
Did you walk?

47:39.973 --> 47:41.964
Thank you.

48:28.154 --> 48:30.816
You'll always protect me, won't you?

48:32.392 --> 48:35.452
Yeah. Of course.

48:35.528 --> 48:38.793
Of course I'll protect you.
And I'm gonna protect you.

48:38.865 --> 48:41.197
Justin?

48:41.267 --> 48:43.531
Hi. You're a million miles away.

48:43.603 --> 48:47.266
Yes, I was. Um, I'm taking refuge
in my nasturtium seeds.

48:48.942 --> 48:51.672
Listen, you know—you know
that I'm here for you, don't you?

48:51.744 --> 48:56.010
Yes, I do. Thank you, Ghita.
You're a good friend.

48:56.082 --> 48:58.516
I, uh— I'm afraid I wanted
to ask you a question.

48:58.585 --> 49:01.748
Rather a delicate question.
L—Well, maybe it's indelicate.

49:04.123 --> 49:06.114
Um—
Anything.

49:07.494 --> 49:11.726
What do you think that Arnold and Tessa
were doing at Lake Turkana?

49:11.798 --> 49:14.096
Oh, I see.

49:14.167 --> 49:18.695
You know, they did spend
enough time together to give everyone
the impression that they were—

49:18.771 --> 49:21.103
Come on, Justin.
You know what this place is like.

49:21.174 --> 49:25.076
If you can't have sex, you have
other people's sex— real or imagined.

49:26.546 --> 49:28.673
Who's this?
It's Claude.

49:28.748 --> 49:31.683
Arnold's boyfriend.

49:31.751 --> 49:34.618
I'd never have guessed.

49:34.687 --> 49:37.087
It's illegal here.
You don't shout about it.

49:38.324 --> 49:40.519
Ah, well.

49:40.593 --> 49:42.584
Wish she could've told me.

49:42.662 --> 49:44.926
Perhaps she didn't think
you needed to know.

49:57.010 --> 50:01.970
Tessa Quayle I have,
but I have no Wanza Kilulu.
Are you sure that is the right name?

50:02.048 --> 50:05.882
Uh, yes, Wanza Kilulu, and, uh, there was
a white doctor attending to her,

50:05.952 --> 50:07.943
And he was there when she died.

50:08.021 --> 50:11.752
Perhaps he conducted the postmortem.
Maybe you have a record of the postmortem.

50:11.824 --> 50:15.487
If I have no patient's record,
how can I have a postmortem record?

50:15.562 --> 50:17.928
And we don't have
European doctors working here.

50:17.997 --> 50:20.659
Right, but her name is definitely
Wanza Kilulu,

50:20.733 --> 50:23.896
And I remember that she was—
Well, if she does not appear
in my records here—

50:23.970 --> 50:27.235
I'm sorry. She does not—
I don't think she was—
Yes. No, I understand.

50:27.307 --> 50:30.799
I mean, I'm not mad here.
She was in the bed.
Okay, fine, yeah. I'm sorry.

50:55.702 --> 50:58.603
You want money?

51:01.608 --> 51:03.542
Fifty.

51:03.610 --> 51:06.443
Fifty. Fifty.

51:20.426 --> 51:22.018
Sorry.

51:25.064 --> 51:27.965
He helped my wife,
and I'm trying to find him.

51:28.034 --> 51:30.662
I think he lives here,
but I have no idea where he is.

51:37.877 --> 51:40.573
It's a family. You don't know him?

51:40.647 --> 51:43.582
Kioko Kilulu.
Kioko Kilulu?

51:43.650 --> 51:45.641
Yes, a name. Do you know?

51:45.718 --> 51:48.380
Who is it? Who is it?
It's a family, from here.

51:48.454 --> 51:54.188
He's a young boy, about 12. No?

51:59.565 --> 52:01.556
Kioko?

52:01.634 --> 52:03.568
Kioko, hello.
Hello.

52:03.636 --> 52:05.900
Do— Do you remember me?

52:05.972 --> 52:07.963
I've been looking for you.

52:08.041 --> 52:10.839
No trouble.
You're not in trouble.
I just want to talk to you.

52:10.910 --> 52:14.038
Is this the clinic
where Wanza was treated?

52:22.789 --> 52:24.882
I cannot help you without—

52:28.528 --> 52:31.258
Next.

52:32.665 --> 52:35.896
Can I help you?
Why—Why was that lady
turned away?

52:35.968 --> 52:40.234
She refuses treatment.
But she seemed to want
to have treatment.

52:40.306 --> 52:44.140
She's a T. B. Patient
who discontinued her treatment.
Her card was canceled.

52:44.210 --> 52:47.737
Isn't that all the more reason
to inoculate her child?

52:47.814 --> 52:51.944
This is diphtheria vaccine.
What is your business here, please?

52:52.018 --> 52:54.680
My name is Quayle.
I'm from the British High Commission.

52:54.754 --> 52:57.086
Do you see any of your countrymen
here, Mr. Quayle?

52:57.156 --> 53:00.887
Uh, excuse me one—
May I see your card, Kioko?

53:02.662 --> 53:04.653
I see. This is in Wanza's name.

53:04.731 --> 53:07.495
That's the family—
It's a family medical card, right?
Yes.

53:07.567 --> 53:10.593
And what does "I. C." mean?
It means informed consent.

53:10.670 --> 53:14.436
It means they consented to treatment
and have family medical entitlement.

53:14.507 --> 53:16.498
And that treatment is Dypraxa?

53:17.910 --> 53:22.006
But if they don't give consent,
then they lose the right to medical care?

53:22.081 --> 53:26.415
It's not much of a choice, is it?
I suppose they're not even informed
that they're testing a new drug?

53:26.486 --> 53:29.148
- I don't make the rules, Mr. Quayle.
- Mr. Quayle?

53:29.222 --> 53:31.884
Yes?
Will you please
come with us?

53:34.227 --> 53:37.628
Kioko, there's your card.
Thank you.

53:51.878 --> 53:53.812
Why is the child
being questioned?
It's okay.

54:03.022 --> 54:05.286
Why did you come to talk to this boy?

54:05.358 --> 54:08.555
He attended my wife's funeral,
so I came to thank him.

54:08.628 --> 54:11.119
For a diplomat,
you're not a very good liar.

54:11.197 --> 54:13.290
Well, I haven't risen very high.

54:13.366 --> 54:15.357
We know about your wife,
Mr. Quayle.

54:17.203 --> 54:20.798
He was her lover— this, uh, Bluhm.

54:23.009 --> 54:25.068
So people are pleased to tell me.

54:26.145 --> 54:28.340
These men you hired to kill them—

54:28.414 --> 54:30.882
They rape and kill her,
and they let him go.

54:30.950 --> 54:33.350
Where did you find them?

54:33.419 --> 54:36.684
Well, perhaps I asked a policeman.
Can you tell me what
I'm doing here, please?

54:36.756 --> 54:39.418
We've been asked to... keep you here.

54:39.492 --> 54:42.052
Right. Help us help you.
I'm sorry. Could you explain?

54:43.629 --> 54:46.496
I have not acquired a taste
for Kenyan tea, I'm afraid.

54:46.566 --> 54:50.002
Look, we're trying to help you.
You help us, we help you.

54:50.069 --> 54:54.233
If you give us something small,
we can always say we didn't find you.

54:54.307 --> 54:56.901
Don't you believe I have the power
to let you go?

54:58.077 --> 55:00.477
Can I help you?
Yes.

55:00.546 --> 55:04.243
My name is Woodrow,
Acting Head of Mission
for Her Majesty's government.

55:04.317 --> 55:06.581
This is Detective Inspector Deasey
of Scotland Yard.

55:06.652 --> 55:09.883
Mr. Deasey will be inquiring
into the death of Mr. Quayle's wife.

55:09.956 --> 55:13.084
If you have any questions,
ask them of him.

55:13.159 --> 55:15.389
Is that clear?

55:15.461 --> 55:17.691
You weren't mistreated?
No.

55:17.763 --> 55:21.756
You know whose territory you are in, Mr. —
What did you say your name was?

55:21.834 --> 55:24.530
And your name is?

55:24.604 --> 55:26.538
Right.

55:26.606 --> 55:28.938
The, uh—The boy Kioko
who I came to see—

55:29.008 --> 55:32.136
What have you done with him?
He ran away.

55:32.211 --> 55:34.441
I hope nothing's happened to him.

55:37.550 --> 55:40.041
Where's your car, Justin?
It's near the market.

55:48.060 --> 55:51.757
Is that the official thinking then—
that Arnold killed Tessa?

55:51.831 --> 55:53.822
I'm afraid that's looking likely.

55:53.900 --> 55:56.630
Do you think
that he was her lover?

55:56.702 --> 55:59.500
I'm afraid that's looking likely too.

55:59.572 --> 56:01.904
What were they doing
up at Lake Turkana?

56:03.075 --> 56:07.034
Romantic setting.
Sorry to have to say it, old chap.

56:07.113 --> 56:10.310
But why suspect Bluhm then?
I mean, there may have been others—

56:11.384 --> 56:13.375
Other lovers.

56:13.452 --> 56:16.615
If she was an unfaithful wife,
why stop at Arnold?

56:16.689 --> 56:19.453
I wouldn't listen to rumor,

56:19.525 --> 56:21.516
Unless you've evidence?

56:21.594 --> 56:25.086
Yes, evidence.
That's always the problem.

56:25.164 --> 56:27.428
Justin,

56:27.500 --> 56:29.434
Be a good chap
and leave this to us.

56:29.502 --> 56:31.868
There are proper channels
for these things.

56:54.093 --> 56:56.618
Ghita, hi. Thanks for coming.

56:56.696 --> 57:00.393
So why did you want to meet here?
Something that we shouldn't
be seen talking about?

57:00.466 --> 57:03.128
Dypraxa.

57:04.537 --> 57:09.668
I know that Tessa and Arnold
wrote a report
on the Three Bees trials,

57:09.742 --> 57:11.801
And I need to know
what happened to it.

57:14.547 --> 57:16.640
What makes you think I know?

57:16.716 --> 57:19.685
Because they trusted you,
and so do I.

57:21.454 --> 57:24.252
Help me, please, Ghita.

57:27.994 --> 57:31.725
All I know is that Tessa
gave Sandy a copy.

57:31.797 --> 57:34.561
Sandy? Why him?

57:36.035 --> 57:38.868
Sandy was a compromise—
semiofficial.

57:40.172 --> 57:42.436
Arnold wanted to go public with it.
Tessa wouldn't.

57:42.508 --> 57:46.569
Because?
Because she wanted to do it your way,
through channels.

57:46.645 --> 57:48.704
But, Justin, I wouldn't bother
looking for it.

57:48.781 --> 57:52.945
If it threatens British commercial interests,
it would've been shredded.
She could've brought it to me.

57:53.019 --> 57:55.954
She didn't want
to get you involved.
Why?

58:00.092 --> 58:03.584
Ghita, why didn't she
want me involved?
To protect you.

58:09.268 --> 58:12.237
Do you know if she showed
the report to anyone else?

58:12.304 --> 58:14.295
Kenny Curtiss.

58:18.144 --> 58:20.612
Time of the month, Kenny?

58:20.679 --> 58:22.670
Fuck off.

58:22.748 --> 58:24.739
Might help if you took
the fucking flag out.

58:24.817 --> 58:27.752
Well, get closer to the fucking hole,
and maybe I will.

58:29.021 --> 58:31.854
Interesting man you got there, Crick.

58:31.924 --> 58:33.915
Must be the only white caddy in Africa.

58:35.061 --> 58:39.498
Look, KDH are waiting for me
to default on my Dypraxa commitments,

58:39.565 --> 58:41.556
And I have a cash flow problem.

58:41.634 --> 58:44.125
What are you lot going to do about it?

58:45.771 --> 58:48.035
We never promised
to protect you commercially.

58:49.675 --> 58:51.666
You protect me?
That's fucking rich.

58:51.744 --> 58:54.736
A word or two from me
in the right black ear,
a couple of cases of Krug,

58:54.814 --> 58:56.805
And you'd be on the next plane
back home.

58:56.882 --> 59:00.613
I mean, I spend more money
on champagne in a year
than your shop's annual fucking budget.

59:00.686 --> 59:04.417
Oh, there you go—
Cause of your cash-flow problem.

59:04.490 --> 59:06.481
You're in my eyeline, old chap.

59:06.559 --> 59:09.722
You're what passes for James Bond
around here.

59:09.795 --> 59:13.287
Get Her Majesty's secret service
to pull a few strings.
It's what you spies do, isn't it?

59:14.366 --> 59:16.357
Is it?

59:16.435 --> 59:18.835
Never really sure what it is we do.

59:21.707 --> 59:24.369
Don't even think about
bullying me, old man.

59:24.443 --> 59:27.708
I'm not a member of your gentlemen's club.
I don't have to play by the rules.

59:27.780 --> 59:30.146
So it seems.

59:30.216 --> 59:32.207
Call that one in, shall we?

59:36.422 --> 59:40.256
Mr. Curtiss, I'm sorry
to disturb your game.

59:40.326 --> 59:42.988
My name is Justin Quayle
from the High Commission.

59:43.062 --> 59:45.223
I believe you knew my wife, Tessa.

59:45.297 --> 59:47.857
Justin. Didn't know
you were a member here.

59:47.933 --> 59:49.867
Yes, I met her
at one of your parties.

59:49.935 --> 59:52.096
She came to see you, I think.

59:52.171 --> 59:55.231
She gave you a report
that she had written on Dypraxa.

59:55.307 --> 59:58.902
Justin, I really don't think
this is the time or the place—

59:58.978 --> 1:00:02.675
I hope you didn't find her too troublesome,
because she could be a terrier
when she had a scent.

1:00:02.748 --> 1:00:05.410
Huh, sounds like you're
describing a bitch.

1:00:08.420 --> 1:00:10.888
I'm sorry about your loss,

1:00:10.956 --> 1:00:12.947
But I don't remember
being given any report.

1:00:14.026 --> 1:00:16.460
Well, that's odd,
because she noted it in her diary.

1:00:16.529 --> 1:00:19.430
Then you know more than I do.

1:00:23.035 --> 1:00:26.402
Didn't know, uh—
Didn't know Tessa kept a diary.

1:00:27.573 --> 1:00:31.236
Well, I think Tessa was right then, Tim.
You don't know everything.

1:00:32.578 --> 1:00:35.376
I know where you're going
on Tuesday.

1:01:04.376 --> 1:01:07.311
Next, please.

1:01:09.648 --> 1:01:12.048
Sorry about the weather.

1:01:12.117 --> 1:01:14.176
It's hardly your fault.

1:01:14.253 --> 1:01:16.483
Oh, dear. We've had some forgeries
on the diplomatics.

1:01:16.555 --> 1:01:18.489
I'm gonna have to keep this,
I'm afraid, sir.

1:01:18.557 --> 1:01:22.550
- What?
- The F. C. O. Will issue you
with a new one in a few days.

1:01:23.629 --> 1:01:27.087
What if I want to travel with it?
Just two, three days at the most.

1:01:27.166 --> 1:01:30.431
Are you saying that's a forgery?
It does happen, sir,
even on diplomatics.

1:01:30.502 --> 1:01:34.529
But that was issued to me a year ago
by the diplomatic office—
Sir, the F. C. O. Will take care of that.

1:02:02.534 --> 1:02:05.367
It's just here on the right.

1:02:22.288 --> 1:02:24.222
Good afternoon, sir.
Good afternoon.

1:02:24.290 --> 1:02:26.690
Let me take that for you.
Oh, I'd rather keep it with me.

1:02:26.759 --> 1:02:29.489
Uh, club rule, Justin.
I'm sorry.

1:02:29.561 --> 1:02:32.029
No— No luggage in the, uh—
in the dining room.

1:02:32.097 --> 1:02:36.261
Could you just tuck it into your cubbyhole,
please, Jimmy? Thank you.
Certainly, sir. Thank you, sir.

1:02:36.335 --> 1:02:40.237
My dear fellow, what a dreadful time
you've had. Welcome home.
Thank you, Bernard.

1:02:40.306 --> 1:02:44.367
Any, uh, plans,
or is it too soon?
Plans?

1:02:44.443 --> 1:02:47.037
Well, holiday, visiting friends,

1:02:47.112 --> 1:02:50.275
The million things you've always wanted
Mmm.

1:02:50.349 --> 1:02:54.183
You're on indefinite sick leave.
Enjoy it.

1:02:54.253 --> 1:02:57.416
I hear the, uh— the snow's
very good at Chamonix.

1:02:57.489 --> 1:03:00.822
I don't have a passport, Bernard.
They took mine at the airport.

1:03:00.893 --> 1:03:04.556
Oh, of course, yes.
You missed the, um—
You missed the recall.

1:03:05.664 --> 1:03:09.794
Mmm. The sole meunière's
not bad here,

1:03:09.868 --> 1:03:12.268
If— if you like sole.

1:03:12.338 --> 1:03:15.171
Otherwise have it grilled.
Grilled'll be fine.

1:03:17.409 --> 1:03:19.400
Um, no starters, I think.

1:03:24.516 --> 1:03:26.507
You've been cleared, by the way.

1:03:26.585 --> 1:03:29.554
Thought we'd get that bit
of unpleasantness dealt with first.

1:03:29.621 --> 1:03:32.351
Cleared for what?
Um, of what.

1:03:32.424 --> 1:03:34.892
Uh, murder most foul.

1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:38.691
Seems you didn't hire
contract killers
in a den of vice after all.

1:03:38.764 --> 1:03:42.427
Deasey is satisfied
it was a crime of passion
by our dark medical horse.

1:03:42.501 --> 1:03:44.492
It's just a question now
of finding Bluhm.

1:03:44.570 --> 1:03:46.595
Arnold Bluhm is gay,
Bernard.

1:03:46.672 --> 1:03:49.334
Gay men don't rape
their women friends.

1:03:49.408 --> 1:03:53.504
Well, I've known one or two
very savage queens in my time.

1:03:53.579 --> 1:03:58.744
Do you no good to go poking around
under rocks, Justin.

1:03:58.817 --> 1:04:01.786
Some very nasty things
live under rocks,

1:04:01.854 --> 1:04:03.845
Especially in foreign gardens.

1:04:03.922 --> 1:04:08.086
Advice of a friend.
What is it that I'm not
to look into, Bernard?

1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:10.958
Quayles have always made
reliable foreign service men.

1:04:11.029 --> 1:04:15.159
Shouldn't be surprised
if you've still got a small
Head of Mission in your knapsack.

1:04:15.234 --> 1:04:18.465
Challenging post.
More challenging than
dealing with Kenny Curtiss?

1:04:19.805 --> 1:04:23.935
He's a crude sort of chap, our Kenny,
but he flies the flag for us.

1:04:24.009 --> 1:04:26.705
He got up dear Tessa's nose, I fear.

1:04:26.779 --> 1:04:29.043
- Yes, she wrote a report about it.
- About Kenny?

1:04:29.114 --> 1:04:31.105
No, about Dypraxa.
Ah, that.

1:04:31.183 --> 1:04:35.142
She expected some action to be taken,
but none was, was it?

1:04:35.220 --> 1:04:37.950
She tell you about the letter,
or did you find it among her things?

1:04:38.023 --> 1:04:41.959
Tucked into her diary,
perhaps?
What letter is that, Bernard?

1:04:42.027 --> 1:04:46.964
Ramblings of an aging fart.
Senility setting in early, alas.

1:04:47.032 --> 1:04:50.365
Naughty of her to take it though.
Very naughty indeed.

1:04:50.436 --> 1:04:52.336
Yes, I found that.

1:04:52.404 --> 1:04:55.066
Be grateful to have it back.
Written under stress, you understand.

1:04:55.140 --> 1:04:58.132
Regrettable things said. Wouldn't
want it falling into the wrong hands.

1:04:58.210 --> 1:05:00.872
Sorry, Bernard.
Are we talking about the same letter?

1:05:00.946 --> 1:05:02.880
What's yours about?

1:05:05.350 --> 1:05:07.477
Undying love.

1:05:07.553 --> 1:05:09.487
Ah.

1:05:13.559 --> 1:05:15.857
What's yours?

1:05:15.928 --> 1:05:19.989
They're not so good grilled.
You should've had the meunière.

1:05:20.399 --> 1:05:23.095
Ladies and gentlemen—

1:05:38.250 --> 1:05:43.415
Ladies and gentlemen,
please keep all your belongings
with you at all times.

1:05:59.204 --> 1:06:01.069
It's good to see you, Ham.

1:06:01.139 --> 1:06:04.233
Sorry about the blubbing.
It's those bloody Latin genes,
you know.

1:06:04.309 --> 1:06:06.243
It's the same old Ham.

1:06:06.311 --> 1:06:08.802
Oh, no. No, not anymore.

1:06:08.881 --> 1:06:11.577
God, I loved her rotten.

1:06:11.650 --> 1:06:13.584
And she loved you rotten.

1:06:13.652 --> 1:06:17.554
First cousins can be closer
than siblings.

1:06:17.623 --> 1:06:21.252
I still don't understand why I let you
talk me out of going to the funeral.

1:06:21.326 --> 1:06:24.352
It was the wrong crowd for you, Ham.
We'll have a private memorial service here.

1:06:24.429 --> 1:06:27.626
You can blub
all your way through it.
Don't think I won't.

1:06:27.699 --> 1:06:30.668
Hire the Abbey.
You can afford it now.
Can I?

1:06:30.736 --> 1:06:35.400
Tess left you bloody well off.
Want to know what you're worth?
Not particularly.

1:06:35.474 --> 1:06:39.672
Oh, I've got the keys to the Chelsea house.
Thought you might want to stay there
while you're in London.

1:06:39.745 --> 1:06:41.736
No, I'd rather not.
Well, it's all yours.

1:06:41.813 --> 1:06:44.179
That and her African women's charity.

1:06:44.249 --> 1:06:46.809
Said it would get you
out of the garden.
When did she say that?

1:06:46.885 --> 1:06:49.410
Two weeks before she died.

1:06:50.822 --> 1:06:53.848
Look, I am ravenous.
Have you had lunch?

1:06:53.926 --> 1:06:56.861
Yes, I have. A very civilized lunch
with Bernard Pellegrin...

1:06:56.929 --> 1:07:00.922
Who expressed an interest
in Tessa's diary.

1:07:00.999 --> 1:07:03.263
But Tess never kept a diary.
She hated the things.

1:07:03.335 --> 1:07:07.465
You and I know that.
Pellegrin must have been disinformed.

1:07:07.539 --> 1:07:12.340
Tess thought she was being watched.
Didn't stop her e-mailing twice a day.

1:07:12.411 --> 1:07:15.437
More inquiries than Google.

1:07:15.514 --> 1:07:18.312
Look at him.
The boy is two-thirds machine.

1:07:18.383 --> 1:07:21.716
I'm telling you, it's scary.
Mind of a computer.

1:07:21.787 --> 1:07:25.223
Appetite of a waste disposal.
And what's the other third?

1:07:25.290 --> 1:07:28.350
Oh, Manzini, unquestionably.

1:07:28.427 --> 1:07:31.225
Those e-mails from Tess—
Guido helped me with them.

1:07:31.296 --> 1:07:33.230
Company stuff. Boring.

1:07:33.298 --> 1:07:36.961
Mm. Ownership, franchises,
that sort of thing.

1:07:37.035 --> 1:07:39.560
I'm trying to find out
who brokered the marriage.

1:07:39.638 --> 1:07:43.540
What marriage?
KDH and Three Bees.

1:07:43.609 --> 1:07:47.636
KDH make Dypraxa.
Three Bees test it.

1:07:47.713 --> 1:07:51.877
It's a marriage of convenience, of course.
Both in it for what they can get out of it.

1:07:51.950 --> 1:07:54.714
That phrase about the marriage—
Is that Tess's phrase or yours?

1:07:54.786 --> 1:07:57.084
Oh, hers. Hers.

1:07:58.857 --> 1:08:01.189
Producing dead offspring.

1:08:01.259 --> 1:08:04.160
Oh, this is so good!
Why don't you try some.

1:08:04.229 --> 1:08:07.062
It looks disgusting.

1:08:07.132 --> 1:08:09.965
I can get that stuff
through her mirror server.

1:08:10.035 --> 1:08:13.334
Well, how do you do that?
All you need is the password. Duh.

1:08:13.405 --> 1:08:15.737
Yeah, but I don't have her password.

1:08:15.807 --> 1:08:18.367
Come on, Jus.
Five letters. Three guesses.

1:08:18.443 --> 1:08:20.911
- I have no idea.
- My name— Guido.

1:08:20.979 --> 1:08:24.540
She used the one for the "l"
and the zero for the "O."

1:08:26.051 --> 1:08:28.383
- I set it up for her.
- Wait, wait.

1:08:28.453 --> 1:08:32.446
- Give him a chance to read it.
- Lightning tour. I'm printing as I go.

1:08:33.859 --> 1:08:36.692
What's Hippo?

1:08:36.762 --> 1:08:39.390
German— German Pharma Watch.

1:08:39.464 --> 1:08:41.398
Keep an eye on what
the drug companies are up to.

1:08:44.403 --> 1:08:47.065
Copy that.

1:08:50.876 --> 1:08:53.208
KDH. Can we open that?

1:08:53.278 --> 1:08:55.746
Sure. No problem.

1:08:55.814 --> 1:08:58.715
A new plague is sweeping the world.

1:08:58.784 --> 1:09:04.222
In the 21st century, multi-resistant
T. B. Will kill one in three.

1:09:04.289 --> 1:09:07.315
- But now there is hope.
- It's huge, isn't it?

1:09:07.392 --> 1:09:12.056
KDH is developing a revolutionary
treatment for T. B. Sufferers.
It's global.

1:09:12.130 --> 1:09:16.464
We call it Dypraxa.
You will call it life.

1:09:16.535 --> 1:09:18.560
And I call it a blockbuster.

1:09:18.637 --> 1:09:23.097
Karel Delacourt Hudson.
The world is our clinic.

1:09:23.175 --> 1:09:26.110
It's gonna sell like hotcakes.

1:09:26.178 --> 1:09:30.444
- Can you magnify that photograph?
- Magnify it? He can send it out
for doughnuts.

1:09:36.254 --> 1:09:39.553
Is it possible to zoom in on it?
Yeah, sure.

1:09:42.227 --> 1:09:45.788
It's Pellegrin.
Why is he there?

1:09:45.864 --> 1:09:48.128
There's a personal file.
Do you mind if I open it?

1:09:48.200 --> 1:09:50.430
No, sure. Go ahead.

1:09:58.510 --> 1:10:01.001
Ti amo.

1:10:01.079 --> 1:10:04.480
So you'd better ask that kind,
nice husband of yours to translate.

1:10:04.549 --> 1:10:07.609
He's got very delicate little ears.

1:10:07.686 --> 1:10:11.053
He's dreaming
about his favorite things.

1:10:11.123 --> 1:10:14.183
He's dreaming about...

1:10:14.259 --> 1:10:17.660
A world without any weeds.

1:10:21.266 --> 1:10:23.826
Justin Quayle,
it's time to get up.

1:10:23.902 --> 1:10:28.168
Go away.
You're very annoying.
Time to get up, Justin.

1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:33.007
Get up.

1:10:37.783 --> 1:10:42.277
This is really just not fair.

1:10:42.354 --> 1:10:44.879
It's time to get up.

1:10:44.956 --> 1:10:48.255
Tessa, just let me sleep.

1:10:48.326 --> 1:10:50.692
There's gardening to be done.

1:10:50.762 --> 1:10:54.061
Weeds to be pulled out.

1:10:55.901 --> 1:10:58.495
Good morning.
Come back to bed.

1:11:00.205 --> 1:11:02.639
Good morning.

1:11:02.707 --> 1:11:04.732
Oh, sweetheart.

1:11:18.290 --> 1:11:21.088
Moral dilemma, Ham.

1:11:21.159 --> 1:11:24.959
And the person that I most
want to tell can't be told.

1:11:26.698 --> 1:11:30.862
I had a creepy love letter today.

1:11:30.936 --> 1:11:33.029
It's not your fault.

1:11:33.104 --> 1:11:35.402
From a five-star creep.

1:11:35.473 --> 1:11:37.964
You've got to move on, huh?

1:11:38.043 --> 1:11:41.604
I've cold-bloodedly led on.

1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:45.116
I stole something from him.

1:11:45.183 --> 1:11:49.244
And worse,
I made him a vile promise...

1:11:49.321 --> 1:11:54.554
That I have absolutely
no intention of keeping.

1:11:54.626 --> 1:11:59.086
Oh, do come in.
Yeah, please. Of course.

1:11:59.164 --> 1:12:01.359
Thank you.

1:12:01.433 --> 1:12:04.095
You lead the way.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Take a left.

1:12:04.169 --> 1:12:09.732
I really hate to think how
it would hurt Justin if he knew.

1:12:09.808 --> 1:12:12.675
I've violated his code, Ham,

1:12:12.744 --> 1:12:16.373
In the most cynical way.

1:12:16.448 --> 1:12:19.781
And the end
that justifies my means?

1:12:19.851 --> 1:12:24.948
I need this creep to help me
blackmail Her Majesty's government.

1:12:25.023 --> 1:12:29.084
Please tell me I'm not a ruthless bitch.

1:12:29.160 --> 1:12:33.824
Please tell me that Justin
would understand if he knew.

1:12:33.899 --> 1:12:37.266
If you give me the wrong answer,
then I will push you into the Tiber...

1:12:37.335 --> 1:12:39.963
Like I did when we were 16.

1:12:41.106 --> 1:12:43.131
Ciao, my darling.

1:12:45.310 --> 1:12:47.369
Thank you.

1:12:47.445 --> 1:12:52.041
For this wonderful gift.

1:12:52.117 --> 1:12:55.211
How very generous of me.

1:12:55.287 --> 1:12:58.188
No, l—

1:13:13.271 --> 1:13:14.898
Here, Justin, put this on.

1:13:30.722 --> 1:13:33.714
I like it here.
This is where you work from?
Mm.

1:13:33.792 --> 1:13:36.386
Amnesty.

1:13:36.461 --> 1:13:38.395
Won't make any difference.

1:13:38.463 --> 1:13:40.624
That's the official line
of the Foreign Office.

1:13:40.699 --> 1:13:44.863
I thought you were like that.
I thought you were one of those
privileged revolutionaries.

1:13:56.514 --> 1:14:00.177
- My lady.
- Am I?

1:14:00.251 --> 1:14:04.745
These plants— If they were children,
you'd be prosecuted.

1:14:04.823 --> 1:14:08.919
I do water them.
When I remember.

1:14:15.834 --> 1:14:18.200
You say you're all into saving lives
around the world,

1:14:18.269 --> 1:14:20.897
But you let your poor plants die.

1:14:20.972 --> 1:14:23.805
I say put people first.

1:14:26.845 --> 1:14:30.246
Why don't you water them?
You're being cruel.

1:14:31.483 --> 1:14:33.815
I feel safe with you.

1:14:35.687 --> 1:14:37.746
I can imagine when you were six.

1:14:37.822 --> 1:14:39.790
You leading the revolution.

1:14:52.137 --> 1:14:56.039
Ham? Hi. It's Justin.
Listen.

1:14:56.107 --> 1:15:00.237
Do you still represent that
dodgy client in Amsterdam?

1:15:03.715 --> 1:15:05.740
Sorry.

1:15:07.719 --> 1:15:11.587
Sorry. Sorry. I only just got it.
Directions for use.

1:15:11.656 --> 1:15:14.557
No air travel, no credit cards.

1:15:14.626 --> 1:15:17.720
Never say your name on the phone,
or the computers will kick in.

1:15:17.796 --> 1:15:20.162
Dodgy client adds,
"Welcome to my world."

1:15:20.231 --> 1:15:22.995
Well, I don't want his world.
No choice, old chum.

1:15:23.068 --> 1:15:25.229
Actually, I'm getting
a bit paranoid myself.

1:15:25.303 --> 1:15:28.295
Look, suppose I posited
that all this was just coincidence—

1:15:28.373 --> 1:15:30.341
Tess killed by bandits,
pure and simple...

1:15:30.408 --> 1:15:32.569
And that you're being
as paranoid as she was.

1:15:32.644 --> 1:15:34.839
Ham.

1:15:37.849 --> 1:15:39.942
Thanks for trying, Ham.

1:15:40.018 --> 1:15:42.816
I have to finish what she started.

1:15:42.887 --> 1:15:45.822
Well, look, look. I've got the address
of Aunt Claudia, the old bat in Rome.

1:15:45.890 --> 1:15:48.688
If you need to contact me,
you'd better do it through her.

1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:50.990
She adored Tess.

1:15:52.897 --> 1:15:55.798
I failed her, Ham.

1:15:55.867 --> 1:15:57.926
I lost my faith in her.

1:15:58.002 --> 1:15:59.867
No, she forgives you.

1:16:01.172 --> 1:16:03.834
She loved you rotten too,
you know.

1:16:03.908 --> 1:16:06.638
You think?
Oh, yeah.

1:16:10.248 --> 1:16:12.182
Thank you.

1:17:06.604 --> 1:17:09.801
It seems our erstwhile colleague
has disappeared.

1:17:09.874 --> 1:17:13.708
Four days ago he lunched
in London with Pellegrin,

1:17:13.778 --> 1:17:19.216
Who describes him as overwrought,
after which he visited his wife's lawyer...

1:17:19.284 --> 1:17:21.809
Before going off our radar.

1:17:21.886 --> 1:17:25.185
The poor man seems
to have convinced himself...

1:17:25.256 --> 1:17:29.989
There was a conspiracy against Tessa
in which we are all complicit.

1:17:31.396 --> 1:17:35.355
If he has left the U.K.,
he did so without a passport.

1:17:35.433 --> 1:17:40.268
Therefore, any contact from Justin
must be reported to me immediately.

1:17:40.338 --> 1:17:42.670
In his own best interest.

1:17:44.609 --> 1:17:47.908
No point asking if you've
heard from him, I suppose?

1:17:47.979 --> 1:17:50.743
No, no, Tim, none at all.

1:17:50.815 --> 1:17:55.809
Birgit, why are Three Bees spending
$70 million testing Dypraxa for KDH?

1:17:55.887 --> 1:17:58.185
I mean, is the African market
worth that much?

1:17:58.256 --> 1:18:00.588
Tessa, you have to understand
the scale of this.

1:18:00.658 --> 1:18:04.355
There is a T. B. Epidemic coming.
It will affect the entire world.

1:18:04.429 --> 1:18:08.593
Or, put into the language that stock
exchanges all over the world understand,

1:18:08.666 --> 1:18:11.328
If the T. B. Market performs as forecast,

1:18:11.402 --> 1:18:14.371
Billions and billions of dollars
are waiting to be earned.

1:18:14.439 --> 1:18:16.839
And the boy to earn them is Dypraxa.

1:18:16.908 --> 1:18:20.139
Lf, of course,
the preliminary trials in Africa...

1:18:20.211 --> 1:18:23.339
Have not thrown up
any disturbing side effects.

1:18:43.534 --> 1:18:46.970
Ich suche Birgit.

1:18:52.310 --> 1:18:55.245
Ich bin Justin Quayle,

1:18:55.313 --> 1:18:57.543
Tessa Quayle's Ehemann.

1:19:04.589 --> 1:19:08.582
- Michael Adams.

1:19:17.435 --> 1:19:19.369
Okay, Herr Adams.

1:19:20.672 --> 1:19:25.075
She collects Karl at 3:00
from the kindergarten at Bahnhofstrasse.

1:19:48.366 --> 1:19:51.426
Karl, here.

1:19:57.041 --> 1:19:59.305
Birgit.

1:19:59.377 --> 1:20:02.312
You sent this to my wife.

1:20:02.380 --> 1:20:04.314
Justin.

1:20:04.382 --> 1:20:07.783
I need to talk to you.
Our computers
were stolen last night.

1:20:07.852 --> 1:20:09.843
Yes, I know.
They have never gone
this far before.

1:20:09.921 --> 1:20:12.287
I can't be seen with you.
Sorry. I've Karl to think of.

1:20:12.357 --> 1:20:14.416
Is there some safe place
we could talk?

1:20:14.492 --> 1:20:16.756
Nowhere. Nowhere safe.
Nowhere?

1:20:16.828 --> 1:20:19.820
Please. Just... a few questions.

1:20:19.897 --> 1:20:22.627
Okay, let's talk here.
With these people.
All right.

1:20:22.700 --> 1:20:26.636
Okay. My bike's across the street.
Ask your questions before we get to it.

1:20:26.704 --> 1:20:28.137
Is it a scam?
Scam?

1:20:28.206 --> 1:20:31.642
Dypraxa.
Does it cure T. B.?
Yes, it cures.

1:20:31.709 --> 1:20:34.940
But it can also kill, you know,
because they haven't got
the formula right.

1:20:35.012 --> 1:20:37.742
Right. So why don't they work on that?

1:20:41.819 --> 1:20:45.152
It's cheaper to fix the trials.

1:20:45.223 --> 1:20:47.589
Exclude the patients that
have side effects, you know.

1:20:47.658 --> 1:20:50.593
To go back to the lab would
cost them time— two years—

1:20:50.661 --> 1:20:54.927
Millions of dollars, and other companies
would have time to produce their own cures.

1:20:54.999 --> 1:20:56.990
Okay, next question.

1:20:57.068 --> 1:20:59.593
You said to Tessa in your e-mails
that the Kenyan government
had approved the trials.

1:20:59.670 --> 1:21:02.195
Somebody bribed them.
Who?

1:21:02.273 --> 1:21:04.673
Three Bees, Lorbeer.
We don't know.

1:21:04.742 --> 1:21:09.042
But $50,000 in the right hands,
and you can test battery acid
as skin lotion.

1:21:09.113 --> 1:21:11.172
My bike's there.

1:21:11.249 --> 1:21:14.218
Stop! Stop!

1:21:14.285 --> 1:21:17.118
- Stop!

1:21:41.212 --> 1:21:44.238
Who is Lorbeer?

1:21:44.315 --> 1:21:46.715
Birgit, is it a company?

1:21:46.784 --> 1:21:49.651
A white coat.
He invented Dypraxa.

1:21:49.720 --> 1:21:51.813
When patients started to die,
Lorbeer jumped clear.

1:21:51.889 --> 1:21:55.518
Is that why Tessa went to Lokichogio?
Is that where Lorbeer is?

1:21:55.593 --> 1:21:57.652
Disappeared.
Murdered?

1:21:57.728 --> 1:22:00.595
Disappeared.
We've gotta go. I'm sorry.

1:22:00.665 --> 1:22:02.599
Where can I find him?

1:22:17.114 --> 1:22:20.515
Birgit? Where?

1:22:20.585 --> 1:22:23.520
Go back to Africa.
Lorbeer's still there.

1:24:30.748 --> 1:24:34.240
Tessa, why didn't you tell me?

1:24:36.053 --> 1:24:38.146
I could have helped you.

1:24:43.260 --> 1:24:46.991
It is my sad duty to inform you
that Dr. Bluhm has been found.

1:24:47.064 --> 1:24:49.089
I'll spare you the details.

1:24:49.166 --> 1:24:52.033
Suffice to say, the poor fellow...

1:24:52.103 --> 1:24:55.834
Seems to have been tortured to death
on the same day Tessa was killed.

1:24:55.906 --> 1:24:58.340
Which would seem to exonerate him.

1:24:58.409 --> 1:25:00.877
Seem? So what's the new theory?

1:25:00.945 --> 1:25:03.209
That he tortured himself to death?

1:25:03.280 --> 1:25:05.373
That'd save you looking
for anyone else, wouldn't it?

1:25:05.449 --> 1:25:07.178
Moving on.

1:25:15.426 --> 1:25:17.951
What is the purpose of your visit?

1:25:18.029 --> 1:25:19.963
I'm seeing a friend.

1:25:22.033 --> 1:25:25.560
Welcome to Kenya, Mr. Black.
Thank you.

1:25:25.770 --> 1:25:28.796
Has anyone seen
Three Bees' share price lately?

1:25:30.541 --> 1:25:34.238
Does that mean he won't be able
to contribute to tombola?

1:25:34.311 --> 1:25:38.247
Hardly Kenny's fault if someone
put the word out on him.

1:25:38.315 --> 1:25:41.443
Wish I'd know that's all it took.
I'd have done it sooner.

1:25:41.519 --> 1:25:45.888
I expect he'll land on his feet.
Give him a life peerage.

1:25:45.956 --> 1:25:51.053
Henceforth you shall be known as
Lord fucking Curtiss of fucking Kenya.

1:26:07.978 --> 1:26:12.608
Whoever you are, I don't
take kindly to being blackmailed.

1:26:17.288 --> 1:26:21.349
Christ. How did you get here?

1:26:21.425 --> 1:26:24.690
Safari tour. Via Paris.

1:26:24.762 --> 1:26:27.026
Hunting me now, Justin?

1:26:27.098 --> 1:26:30.431
You're the one on the run.

1:26:32.369 --> 1:26:36.328
I loved her.
I'm not ashamed of it.

1:26:36.407 --> 1:26:39.604
Nor should you be...
if it were true.

1:26:40.044 --> 1:26:42.911
It's not for you to tell me
how I felt.

1:26:45.182 --> 1:26:48.379
If you've read that, you'll see
that I let her read something
she shouldn't.

1:26:48.452 --> 1:26:50.386
Yeah. A letter from Pellegrin.

1:26:52.123 --> 1:26:54.216
She trusted you.

1:26:54.291 --> 1:26:56.282
What do you want for that?

1:26:56.360 --> 1:27:01.696
I want to know why Pellegrin
suppressed Tessa's report.

1:27:01.766 --> 1:27:05.361
It was him, wasn't it?
Don't try and play detective.

1:27:05.436 --> 1:27:09.236
Three Bees, KDH, Dypraxa.
What's the story on that axis of evil?

1:27:09.306 --> 1:27:13.640
KDH is Swiss-Canadian.
So why are we involved?

1:27:13.711 --> 1:27:16.475
Curtiss is one of us.
He's British.

1:27:16.547 --> 1:27:19.914
Christ, Justin, stop bleeding
for bloody Africa
and show some loyalty.

1:27:19.984 --> 1:27:23.385
That plant KDH built in Wales
could have gone to France.

1:27:23.454 --> 1:27:25.854
Fifteen hundred jobs
in a depressed region.

1:27:25.923 --> 1:27:28.221
We owed them.

1:27:30.661 --> 1:27:33.755
They needed help
with the Dypraxa trials.

1:27:33.831 --> 1:27:37.028
KDH needed
an investment partner here.

1:27:37.101 --> 1:27:40.662
Curtiss and Three Bees
served us both.

1:27:40.738 --> 1:27:43.332
And Tessa wanted what?

1:27:46.911 --> 1:27:50.210
Pressure on Kenny...

1:27:51.448 --> 1:27:54.383
To stop the tests,
redesign the bloody drug.

1:27:57.488 --> 1:28:00.048
Three years' delay,
millions of dollars.

1:28:01.826 --> 1:28:03.987
Or?

1:28:04.061 --> 1:28:07.758
We're not paid
to be bleeding hearts.

1:28:07.832 --> 1:28:09.766
You know that, Justin.

1:28:11.435 --> 1:28:14.404
We're not killing people
who wouldn't be dead otherwise.

1:28:15.673 --> 1:28:19.473
Look at the death rate.
Not that anybody's counting.

1:28:19.543 --> 1:28:23.411
But you were
a bleeding heart, Sandy.

1:28:23.480 --> 1:28:28.110
Tessa was your salvation,
wasn't she, from all this?

1:28:29.553 --> 1:28:31.919
You loved her. Remember?

1:28:33.557 --> 1:28:36.993
Pellegrin said the report
was too damaging...

1:28:37.061 --> 1:28:39.154
And she had to be stopped.

1:28:39.230 --> 1:28:43.724
Oh, yes. She was stopped.

1:28:46.704 --> 1:28:48.638
I betrayed her.

1:28:50.241 --> 1:28:52.175
We all did.

1:28:53.811 --> 1:28:57.440
You did it by... growing flowers.

1:29:03.420 --> 1:29:06.184
How did you betray her, Sandy?

1:29:10.261 --> 1:29:12.923
They wanted to know
what she was up to.

1:29:12.997 --> 1:29:16.626
I'm the one who told them
she was going to Loki.

1:29:16.700 --> 1:29:22.536
- Who did you tell?
- Pellegrin.

1:29:24.942 --> 1:29:27.638
But God knows who he told.

1:30:01.612 --> 1:30:04.809
Ghita, get in the car.
Get in the car!

1:30:04.882 --> 1:30:09.649
- Go!

1:30:21.298 --> 1:30:23.232
Get in.

1:30:25.269 --> 1:30:27.203
Listen, fuckhead,
if I wanted you dead,

1:30:27.271 --> 1:30:29.205
I would've brought Crick with me.

1:30:30.708 --> 1:30:33.176
I wanna show you something.

1:30:33.243 --> 1:30:36.178
Show me from there.

1:30:36.246 --> 1:30:39.875
Don't mess me about.
I'm doing you a favor.

1:30:55.199 --> 1:30:57.759
How did you know where I'd be?

1:30:57.835 --> 1:30:59.996
I've still got a friend or two, you know?

1:31:01.739 --> 1:31:06.335
We're marked men, Quayle.
They've called in my fucking bank loans.

1:31:06.410 --> 1:31:10.107
I'm finished.
They want you silenced.

1:31:10.180 --> 1:31:14.583
And they want another country's flag
flying over my pharma division.

1:31:16.653 --> 1:31:21.317
So, you've been asking
about Wanza Kilulu.

1:31:23.627 --> 1:31:28.621
She's under there,
covered in quicklime.

1:31:28.699 --> 1:31:31.668
Her and 62 others
who never officially existed.

1:31:31.735 --> 1:31:33.669
Dypraxa?

1:31:36.607 --> 1:31:38.541
Yeah.

1:31:40.210 --> 1:31:43.668
Is that where I'm going?
Not on my agenda.

1:31:47.384 --> 1:31:49.716
Then why are you
showing me this?

1:31:51.055 --> 1:31:55.424
Let's just say
if I'm going to the wall,
I want a trophy.

1:31:55.492 --> 1:31:59.588
That's what you lot do,
isn't it? Heads on walls.

1:32:00.998 --> 1:32:03.626
I think I'll have Pellegrin's
fucking head on mine.

1:32:06.270 --> 1:32:10.866
So, now you know where it is.
I'm not taking any fucking questions.

1:32:10.941 --> 1:32:14.138
What about Lorbeer?

1:32:14.211 --> 1:32:18.511
That Bible-thumping bullshitter,
he's doing his penance in the Sudan.

1:32:18.582 --> 1:32:20.948
Jesus the healer.

1:32:33.831 --> 1:32:37.289
You don't know where I'm going?
You get one guess.

1:32:40.704 --> 1:32:43.036
I'm gonna surprise you, Tess.

1:32:43.107 --> 1:32:45.701
- I love this man.
- Hello.

1:32:54.818 --> 1:33:00.188
I wish you had shared
just a few things.

1:33:06.130 --> 1:33:08.997
I love you.
I love you too.

1:34:27.077 --> 1:34:30.706
Who did you think it was?

1:34:30.781 --> 1:34:34.342
Fuck you, Donohue.
This is bandit country.

1:34:38.455 --> 1:34:41.117
Did you tell Curtiss where I'd be?

1:34:41.191 --> 1:34:43.125
Ghita's car?

1:34:43.193 --> 1:34:46.458
Well, Ghita's
my only friend here, Tim.

1:34:46.530 --> 1:34:48.998
I wouldn't want her
to get into trouble.
She won't.

1:34:51.268 --> 1:34:54.760
You do have another friend,
believe it or not.

1:34:54.838 --> 1:34:57.773
You won't find what
you're looking for in Loki.

1:34:59.276 --> 1:35:01.301
Let's be honest
with each other, shall we?

1:35:01.378 --> 1:35:04.313
That's a— a late career change
for you, Tim.

1:35:05.582 --> 1:35:09.211
There's something else
we have in common, you and I.

1:35:09.286 --> 1:35:12.414
We'll both be dead by Christmas.

1:35:12.489 --> 1:35:15.219
There's a contract out on you.

1:35:15.292 --> 1:35:17.852
Same people who did for Tessa,
I shouldn't wonder.

1:35:17.928 --> 1:35:19.862
Mine's cancer.

1:35:21.965 --> 1:35:24.365
My pain is controllable.

1:35:24.434 --> 1:35:28.632
I knew that you were ill.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

1:35:28.705 --> 1:35:32.232
Yeah. Sandy tell you?

1:35:32.309 --> 1:35:34.243
He fingered Tessa.

1:35:34.311 --> 1:35:36.472
He said he'd made a phone call.

1:35:36.546 --> 1:35:40.880
He didn't know they'd kill her.
Silly sod was besotted with her.

1:35:40.951 --> 1:35:44.045
But that's the way it works
with corporate murder.

1:35:44.121 --> 1:35:47.056
Boss gets wind of something,
calls in his head of security,

1:35:47.124 --> 1:35:51.493
Who talks to someone,
who talks to a friend of someone.

1:35:51.561 --> 1:35:54.462
Finishes up with an answering machine
in a rented office,

1:35:54.531 --> 1:35:57.295
A couple of sensitive gentlemen
in a blue pickup truck.

1:35:57.367 --> 1:35:59.767
They will never know
who ordered the hit.

1:36:02.739 --> 1:36:04.673
I can get you out of Kenya.

1:36:04.741 --> 1:36:07.710
It's one of the few things
we still do well.

1:36:07.778 --> 1:36:09.939
Drop it now, and it's over.

1:36:10.013 --> 1:36:12.379
I'll make sure word
gets to the right people.

1:36:12.449 --> 1:36:16.579
Go home... and live.

1:36:16.653 --> 1:36:19.213
But I don't have a home, Tim.

1:36:19.289 --> 1:36:21.257
Tessa was my home.

1:36:25.028 --> 1:36:27.019
Know about Bluhm?

1:36:27.097 --> 1:36:29.031
What about Bluhm?

1:36:29.099 --> 1:36:31.567
Let me tell you
what you're facing.

1:36:33.403 --> 1:36:36.998
They dragged him into the desert,
cut out his tongue,

1:36:37.074 --> 1:36:40.771
Chopped off his manly apparatus
and stuffed them where his tongue had been.

1:36:40.844 --> 1:36:42.937
Then they crucified the poor bugger.

1:36:43.013 --> 1:36:47.211
Pathologist's opinion is
he was still alive when they nailed him up.

1:36:47.284 --> 1:36:49.309
Of course, you might be lucky.

1:36:49.386 --> 1:36:52.412
It might be in their interest
to make yours look like suicide.

1:36:52.489 --> 1:36:54.423
Which it is.

1:36:54.491 --> 1:36:58.928
Balance of mind disturbed.
No fuss, no inquiry.

1:36:58.995 --> 1:37:01.361
Nothing.
Right.

1:37:01.431 --> 1:37:04.195
Well, thank you for the warning.

1:37:04.267 --> 1:37:06.462
You've been very kind.

1:37:09.272 --> 1:37:11.570
I was afraid you'd say that.

1:37:15.278 --> 1:37:17.405
In case you meet any bandits.

1:38:21.778 --> 1:38:24.338
I, uh— I wondered
if you could help me.
Yes, sir?

1:38:36.126 --> 1:38:38.321
Thank you for agreeing
to take me, Mr. —

1:38:38.395 --> 1:38:41.364
Please. I can't hear you.
Please put these on.

1:38:41.431 --> 1:38:45.231
I said thank you
for taking me, Mr. Andika.

1:38:45.302 --> 1:38:48.567
Jonah. No formalities up here.

1:38:48.638 --> 1:38:52.039
Do you know about
Southern Sudan, Mr. Black?

1:38:52.108 --> 1:38:54.633
The place we're going to
is a food camp,

1:38:54.711 --> 1:38:57.407
But on the way we must drop
to some villages.

1:38:57.481 --> 1:39:00.917
We’re just about to do a live run.
Take a look.

1:39:10.694 --> 1:39:13.754
His name is Brandt,
this man you want to see.

1:39:13.830 --> 1:39:16.196
He works at the clinic up there.

1:39:16.266 --> 1:39:19.201
He's a good man,
but he pushes God with the pills.

1:39:19.269 --> 1:39:21.237
Don't get him started.

1:39:28.478 --> 1:39:33.472
Better strap yourself in.
We're landing on the surface of the moon.

1:40:16.826 --> 1:40:20.262
Hi. Uh, Robert Black,
freelance journalist.

1:40:20.330 --> 1:40:22.264
I'm looking for Dr. Brandt.

1:40:22.332 --> 1:40:24.994
Dr. Brandt? Yeah, he's just here.
He's traveling over from the village.
Thank you.

1:40:33.577 --> 1:40:36.603
- Dr. Brandt?
- I'll see you over by the tent.

1:41:00.036 --> 1:41:02.834
My name is Robert Black.
I'm a freelance journalist.
Uh-huh.

1:41:02.906 --> 1:41:06.103
I'm told that you're the man to talk to.
I don't know
about that, Mr. Black.

1:41:06.176 --> 1:41:08.610
But I can tell you what's
happening around here, yeah?
Good.

1:41:08.678 --> 1:41:10.669
Meet my self-appointed
assistant, Abuk.

1:41:10.747 --> 1:41:12.908
Abuk.
Hello. How are you?

1:41:12.983 --> 1:41:15.315
Hello. How are you?
I'm very well.

1:41:15.385 --> 1:41:18.445
Follow me. Come this way.

1:41:18.521 --> 1:41:22.821
Youse need to go
all to the medical center,
quickly as possible.

1:41:28.932 --> 1:41:31.594
I only give the food
to the women, Mr. Black.

1:41:31.668 --> 1:41:35.365
The women make the homes.
The men make the wars... and hooch.

1:41:35.438 --> 1:41:38.737
Adam was God's first draft.
He got it right with Eve.

1:41:38.808 --> 1:41:40.935
You tell that
to your readers, Mr. Black.

1:41:41.011 --> 1:41:43.377
It's a philosophy
that I learned from my wife.

1:41:43.446 --> 1:41:47.712
Cherish her, man. Cherish her.
One of God's finest creations.

1:41:47.784 --> 1:41:50.446
Now I'll show you
what the devil's up to.

1:42:07.937 --> 1:42:10.098
Our treatment center.
Pretty crude, isn't it?

1:42:10.173 --> 1:42:12.767
Well, I've seen hospitals
little better. In Nairobi.

1:42:12.842 --> 1:42:17.870
So have I. Gharan, what surprises
have they got in store for us this month?

1:42:17.947 --> 1:42:22.384
Have you checked those things?
Ja? Should be 40 boxes.

1:42:23.987 --> 1:42:27.445
Free medicines, Mr. Black.

1:42:27.524 --> 1:42:29.890
Most of them well beyond
their sell-by date.

1:42:29.959 --> 1:42:33.486
The drug companies donate them.
It's a tax break for them.

1:42:33.563 --> 1:42:35.997
Disposable drugs
for disposable patients.

1:42:36.066 --> 1:42:39.763
Out here they have
absolutely no shelf life.

1:42:39.836 --> 1:42:43.169
Safest thing to do
is incinerate them.

1:42:47.310 --> 1:42:51.610
Big pharmaceuticals are right up there
with the arms dealers.

1:42:53.049 --> 1:42:55.574
This is how the world
fucks Africa, Mr. Black.

1:42:55.652 --> 1:42:59.110
Blood on their hands?
It's how they expiate their guilt.

1:42:59.189 --> 1:43:02.647
Pharmaceuticals,
the aid agencies, everybody.

1:43:02.726 --> 1:43:06.162
This whole machine
is driven by guilt.

1:43:06.229 --> 1:43:08.459
Is it?

1:43:08.531 --> 1:43:11.295
And now you will sample
my goat stew. Come with me.

1:43:16.372 --> 1:43:18.533
So tell me, Robert,

1:43:18.608 --> 1:43:21.236
Do you believe an individual
can redeem himself by good acts?

1:43:21.311 --> 1:43:23.245
Abuk.

1:43:23.313 --> 1:43:25.975
I do, yes.

1:43:26.049 --> 1:43:28.779
Maybe the redemption
is in the struggle, huh?

1:43:28.852 --> 1:43:31.878
God has your head.
The devil has your balls.

1:43:31.955 --> 1:43:34.287
So which particular devil had yours?

1:43:34.357 --> 1:43:36.723
Oh, you don't want to know
about that, Robert.

1:43:36.793 --> 1:43:38.988
What's your paper
really interested in?

1:43:39.062 --> 1:43:41.860
In the big
pharmaceutical companies.

1:43:41.931 --> 1:43:45.628
African guinea pigs.
Cheap trials for unsound drugs.

1:43:45.702 --> 1:43:48.569
Uninformed consent extorted
with threats against children.
Who are you?

1:43:48.638 --> 1:43:50.572
Christ!
Payoffs, cover-ups.

1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:53.074
You were in Nairobi.
At the hospital.
Unmarked graves.

1:43:53.143 --> 1:43:55.577
I knew I'd seen you
somewhere before.
Murder.

1:43:55.645 --> 1:43:58.580
You're the husband.
That's right, Dr. Lorbeer.

1:43:58.648 --> 1:44:02.209
Markus! Markus!

1:44:12.796 --> 1:44:15.594
Something's going on out there.
Why did my wife come here?

1:44:15.665 --> 1:44:18.463
She—They had written this report.

1:44:18.535 --> 1:44:21.436
Sixteen pages of inspired guesswork.

1:44:21.504 --> 1:44:23.836
I was supposed to provide
the missing clinical data.

1:44:23.907 --> 1:44:26.774
Testify on tape.
And did you?

1:44:26.843 --> 1:44:28.367
This could be a raid.

1:44:37.987 --> 1:44:41.388
Tribesman. Nasty.
They steal cattle, food, children.

1:44:41.457 --> 1:44:45.018
- I think maybe we should leave.
- Did you testify on tape?

1:44:45.094 --> 1:44:47.961
She was a very persuasive woman,
your wife, Mr. Quayle.

1:44:48.031 --> 1:44:50.295
And, no, I do not have the tape.
They took the tape.

1:44:50.366 --> 1:44:55.235
But you kept a copy
of the report, yes?
Yes, I did. You're welcome to it.

1:44:57.674 --> 1:45:00.905
Level four alert!
They're leaving in five minutes.

1:45:00.977 --> 1:45:05.414
If you don't want to die, my friend,
you'd better come with me to the airstrip.

1:45:05.481 --> 1:45:06.914
Hurry.

1:45:18.962 --> 1:45:22.329
- We can still make it.
- What were Tessa and Bluhm
doing at Lake Turkana?

1:45:22.398 --> 1:45:24.958
Are you crazy?
We've got to get out of here, man.

1:45:25.034 --> 1:45:27.332
I mean, these people,
they kill anybody. Sorry.

1:45:27.403 --> 1:45:29.997
Have you lost your senses?

1:45:30.073 --> 1:45:32.598
- There was something else!
There was a letter!

1:45:32.675 --> 1:45:35.439
Look, you're a lunatic.
Do you know what you're doing?

1:45:35.511 --> 1:45:38.071
You're killing us both.
We'll take our chances with them.

1:47:09.806 --> 1:47:11.933
No!

1:47:48.611 --> 1:47:51.045
- Get down!

1:48:27.650 --> 1:48:29.174
Abuk!

1:48:31.387 --> 1:48:35.756
Abuk! You okay?
Come with us, quick. Run.

1:48:35.825 --> 1:48:37.349
Run.

1:48:38.694 --> 1:48:40.628
Wait. Wait!

1:48:48.571 --> 1:48:51.631
Be careful!
Abuk, be careful!

1:48:51.707 --> 1:48:53.868
Here!

1:48:59.148 --> 1:49:01.582
Hurry on up!
Where have you guys been?

1:49:01.651 --> 1:49:03.812
Sorry about that, Jonah.

1:49:03.886 --> 1:49:08.152
- I'm sorry. I can't take the girl.
- I'm not leaving her.

1:49:08.224 --> 1:49:11.250
- We're only allowed to evacuate aid workers.
- Well, to hell with what's allowed.

1:49:11.327 --> 1:49:14.558
I'll— How much do you want for her?

1:49:14.630 --> 1:49:18.157
- Look, there's $800.
- Don't embarrass me.

1:49:18.234 --> 1:49:21.169
You can't buy this. The rules
are made for good reason, please.

1:49:21.237 --> 1:49:24.001
This is a child's life!
There are no rules to cover that!

1:49:24.073 --> 1:49:26.405
Look, there are thousands
of them out there.

1:49:26.476 --> 1:49:28.808
I can't make an exception
for this one child.

1:49:28.878 --> 1:49:32.814
Yes, but this is one we can help! Here.

1:49:32.882 --> 1:49:37.478
Abuk! Abuk! Abuk!

1:49:39.689 --> 1:49:43.386
Listen, that's the way it is here.

1:49:43.459 --> 1:49:45.825
Keep your money.
Strap yourself in, and let's go.

1:49:58.441 --> 1:50:02.207
What— What'll happen to her?

1:50:02.278 --> 1:50:05.941
She might make it to a refugee camp...
if she's lucky.

1:50:34.977 --> 1:50:37.207
This is what you came for,
I believe.

1:50:49.792 --> 1:50:54.889
Your wife would have made that tape public,
Mr. Quayle, with my voice on it.

1:50:54.964 --> 1:50:57.159
That letter was my insurance policy.

1:50:57.233 --> 1:51:00.566
But how did they know
where to find her?

1:51:00.636 --> 1:51:05.096
They were on their way to Marsabit,
taking the whole rotten package
to Grace Makanga.

1:51:05.174 --> 1:51:07.165
Makanga would have put it
in front of the U. N.

1:51:07.243 --> 1:51:10.770
But someone knew exactly
where Tessa and Arnold would be.

1:51:13.816 --> 1:51:15.784
That was me.

1:51:15.851 --> 1:51:18.445
I radioed Nairobi.

1:51:18.521 --> 1:51:21.684
KDH security man name of Crick.
God, Christ, man.

1:51:21.757 --> 1:51:24.726
I didn't know they
were gonna be murdered.

1:51:24.794 --> 1:51:27.194
My oath to God.

1:51:29.198 --> 1:51:32.258
Crick's going to know
that you were up here.

1:51:32.335 --> 1:51:35.202
Going to be very interested
to know where you're headed.

1:51:35.271 --> 1:51:37.933
What do I tell him?

1:51:39.508 --> 1:51:41.806
He'll know.

1:51:41.877 --> 1:51:44.675
He's been there before.

1:51:46.215 --> 1:51:48.149
Mr. Andika?
Yeah?

1:51:48.217 --> 1:51:52.051
I'd like to apologize
if I embarrassed you earlier.

1:51:52.121 --> 1:51:54.316
It's all right.

1:51:54.390 --> 1:51:59.054
Do you think that it would be possible
to land the plane here?

1:51:59.128 --> 1:52:02.928
Lake Turkana? It's possible,
but you don't wanna go there.

1:52:02.999 --> 1:52:05.229
It's—There's nothing there
but crocodiles.

1:52:05.301 --> 1:52:07.565
Let me take you back to Loki.

1:52:07.637 --> 1:52:09.867
Well, l— I wouldn't be alone for long.

1:52:09.939 --> 1:52:13.340
Please. I'd be, um— I'd be grateful.

1:52:15.044 --> 1:52:17.342
I have one more favor
to ask you, I'm sorry.

1:52:17.413 --> 1:52:20.246
Do you think you could post
that envelope for me?
It's quite urgent.

1:52:20.316 --> 1:52:22.011
Ah, Rome.

1:53:48.771 --> 1:53:52.935
If we have lost in Justin and Tessa...

1:53:53.008 --> 1:53:55.533
Two valued friends,

1:53:55.611 --> 1:54:00.947
The diplomatic community
has lost a true gentleman—

1:54:01.016 --> 1:54:04.008
Courteous, self-effacing,

1:54:05.521 --> 1:54:08.684
Large of heart.

1:54:08.758 --> 1:54:13.991
That he chose to take his own life
in the same remote spot...

1:54:14.063 --> 1:54:17.692
Where Tessa met her tragic death...

1:54:17.767 --> 1:54:21.897
Is a sad reflection
of his tormented state of mind...

1:54:21.971 --> 1:54:25.839
But also typical of his discretion.

1:54:27.543 --> 1:54:31.240
He would not have had us troubled.

1:54:31.313 --> 1:54:35.773
He would not have had us inconvenienced.

1:54:35.851 --> 1:54:39.981
Nothing in his life became him...

1:54:40.055 --> 1:54:42.580
Like the leaving it.

1:54:52.868 --> 1:54:58.272
I have, uh, chosen a text I know
Justin and Tessa would approve.

1:54:58.340 --> 1:55:02.003
It's an epistle.
Noncanonical.

1:55:05.314 --> 1:55:10.513
"My Dear Sandy:
Your naiveté is beyond belief.

1:55:10.586 --> 1:55:14.454
"Knowing our arrangements
with KDH and Three Bees,

1:55:14.523 --> 1:55:16.855
"you send me
this half-baked report...

1:55:16.926 --> 1:55:20.157
"by some bleeding heart
diplomatic wife and her black lover...

1:55:20.229 --> 1:55:22.561
"and ask me to take action.

1:55:22.631 --> 1:55:26.795
"The only action required,
apart from shredding the thing,

1:55:26.869 --> 1:55:30.566
"is to keep a tighter rein
on your resident harlot.

1:55:30.639 --> 1:55:35.941
"I want to know what she does,
where she goes, whom she meets.

1:55:36.011 --> 1:55:39.242
"The issue here is deniability.

1:55:39.315 --> 1:55:42.478
"If nobody told us
Dypraxa was causing deaths,

1:55:42.551 --> 1:55:44.849
"we can't be held responsible.

1:55:44.920 --> 1:55:48.253
"But, my dear Sandy,
should it ever become known...

1:55:48.324 --> 1:55:50.485
"that we've closed our eyes to the deaths,

1:55:50.559 --> 1:55:53.460
"none of us would survive the scandal.

1:55:53.529 --> 1:55:56.464
"I still have great hopes of you.
My love to Gloria.

1:55:56.532 --> 1:55:59.763
Yours Sincerely, Bernard."

1:55:59.835 --> 1:56:04.101
This way, sir.
What do you have to say, sir?

1:56:10.679 --> 1:56:13.978
It was a bizarre sort of suicide.

1:56:15.384 --> 1:56:19.411
His body bore no fewer
than eight bullet wounds...

1:56:19.488 --> 1:56:21.422
From three different guns,

1:56:21.490 --> 1:56:24.391
None of which was the one
found in his hand.

1:56:24.460 --> 1:56:26.428
So who has got away with murder?

1:56:27.963 --> 1:56:30.932
Not, of course, the British government.

1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:35.528
They merely covered up,
as one does, the offensive corpses.

1:56:35.604 --> 1:56:40.701
Though not literally. That was done
by person or persons unknown.

1:56:42.344 --> 1:56:45.507
So who has committed murder?

1:56:45.581 --> 1:56:50.644
Not, of course, the highly respectable firm
of KDH Pharmaceutical,

1:56:50.719 --> 1:56:54.655
Which has enjoyed
record profits this quarter...

1:56:54.723 --> 1:56:57.988
And has now licensed ZimbaMed of Harare...

1:56:58.060 --> 1:57:02.053
To continue testing Dypraxa in Africa.

1:57:03.299 --> 1:57:06.860
No, there are no murders in Africa.

1:57:06.936 --> 1:57:09.666
Only regrettable deaths.

1:57:09.738 --> 1:57:14.869
And from those deaths
we derive the benefits of civilization,

1:57:14.944 --> 1:57:18.107
Benefits we can afford so easily...

1:57:18.180 --> 1:57:21.911
Because those lives
were bought so cheaply.

1:57:53.349 --> 1:57:56.443
I know all your secrets, Tess.

1:57:59.288 --> 1:58:01.848
I think I understand you now.

1:58:37.860 --> 1:58:39.851
You want me to come home.

1:58:45.100 --> 1:58:47.500
But I am home.

1:59:15.564 --> 1:59:17.623
Mr. Quayle.

1:59:26.241 --> 1:59:28.038
Tess.
