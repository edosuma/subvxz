00:33.534 --> 00:40.041
Happy holiday

01:48.984 --> 01:51.152
- Merry Christmas, bud.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas to you.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.326
Okay. Hi, Chief.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.498
Come in.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.546
Hello, honey.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.921
Well, this is our last
night in show business.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.799
Some feeling, huh?

02:53.840 --> 02:55.299
Some feeling.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.009
I got the ring and the license.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.720
- Honey, we're ready.
- Oh.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.098
Say, there's a hook
leftover at the top here.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.307
Should that be?

03:03.308 --> 03:06.027
Never mind, I'll take care of it.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.942
- Jim?
- Huh?

03:13.068 --> 03:15.778
Well, I think that tie's terrible.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.364
Well, who cares?
Tomorrow I'm a farmer.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.532
You'd better go change it.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.701
Listen, honey, when you're
flipping those twinkle toes

03:21.702 --> 03:23.452
who's gonna be looking at my tie?

03:23.453 --> 03:25.287
You only have five minutes. Hurry.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.665
Okay, I'm on my way.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.680
What'd he say?

03:42.681 --> 03:44.348
I didn't tell him.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.100
Why not? We love each other.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.893
You wanna continue dancing.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.813
I know, but he gets a look.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.648
Oh, he's always had that look.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.442
It doesn't mean anything emotionally.

03:54.443 --> 03:56.235
It has something to
do with his liver.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.028
Simply tell him you
had made a mistake.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.281
You don't wanna give up your
career and live on a farm.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.783
But he's already bought the farm.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.958
And the license, and the ring.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.997
Oh, I can't tell him.

04:07.998 --> 04:11.250
All right, I will.
Right after our number.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.377
Listen, darling, don't weaken.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.837
Think of our life together.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.214
Think of diamonds, of sables,

04:17.214 --> 04:18.882
of your own little penthouse.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.676
Is that a promise?

04:20.677 --> 04:23.012
Well, just think about
them for the time being.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.181
Ready, Miss Dixon.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.599
Well, thank you.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.434
Say, this thing didn't come out even.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.905
Oh, I'll fix it. We have to hurry.

04:33.315 --> 04:34.482
I love you.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.030
I love you...

04:36.735 --> 04:38.235
and Jim.

04:38.236 --> 04:42.364
I love Jim, too. But after all,
I mean, let's not be too chummy.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.184
Here she comes down the street

05:10.185 --> 05:12.269
My, oh my, ain't she sweet?

05:12.270 --> 05:15.272
Why, here comes my hot toddy

05:15.273 --> 05:17.900
Over my dead body

05:17.901 --> 05:24.448
I'll capture her heart singing

05:24.449 --> 05:29.328
Just wait until she gets
a load of my dancing

05:29.329 --> 05:36.335
Just wait till I start singing

05:36.336 --> 05:40.756
I'll take her strolling down
the road with my dancing

05:40.757 --> 05:43.509
I can't go wrong, a tender song

05:43.510 --> 05:45.761
And she'll discover my charms

05:45.762 --> 05:48.389
Some fancy taps and she'll collapse

05:48.390 --> 05:51.100
And fall right into my arms

05:51.101 --> 05:57.940
I'll capture her heart singing

05:57.941 --> 06:00.109
Oh, no, you haven't a chance

06:00.110 --> 06:02.988
When I go into my dance

06:07.909 --> 06:14.832
I'll take you through life singing

06:26.177 --> 06:30.523
I'll make you my wife dancing

06:37.898 --> 06:40.274
If you could dance instead of sing

06:40.275 --> 06:42.651
I'd learn to love you somehow

06:42.652 --> 06:44.987
If you could sing instead of dance

06:44.988 --> 06:47.948
I'd take you home with me now

07:01.796 --> 07:04.298
The way you sing don't mean a thing

07:04.299 --> 07:06.759
You'd better stick to your dance

07:06.760 --> 07:09.303
And as for you, your dance won't do

07:09.304 --> 07:12.139
You'll have to sing for romance

07:12.140 --> 07:16.060
I'll capture her heart...

07:16.061 --> 07:18.279
- Singing
- Dancing

08:04.359 --> 08:06.902
Not much of a Christmas
present for you, is it?

08:06.903 --> 08:09.863
I mean, both of us
walking out on you.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.449
Don't worry about me, kid.
I'll do all right.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.909
Whata chum.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.578
Can't you see what we're
walking out on? The grind.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.415
365 days a year.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.250
When's the last time
you had as day off?

08:21.251 --> 08:22.960
I don't know. Maybe last year?

08:22.961 --> 08:24.586
Do you ever hear of Thanksgiving

08:24.587 --> 08:27.047
or Labor Day or the Fourth of July?

08:27.048 --> 08:29.133
- Vaguely.
- You know what they are, don't you?

08:29.134 --> 08:30.676
They're holidays.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.760
Days of rest. There's lots of 'em.

08:32.761 --> 08:34.179
They mark 'em in red on the calendar

08:34.179 --> 08:35.389
so you can't miss 'em.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.100
What happens in show business
when a holiday comes along?

08:38.101 --> 08:40.477
You give an extra performance.

08:40.477 --> 08:41.729
Not for me, brother.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.314
Lila and I are going up to
that farm in Connecticut

08:44.315 --> 08:47.534
and we're gonna live by the calendar.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.946
- Say, Jim?
- Mmm?

08:50.280 --> 08:51.655
There's something you should know.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.408
Oh, I know, Ted. I feel
the same way about you.

08:54.409 --> 08:57.286
You know, we've had
our ups and our downs

08:57.287 --> 08:58.996
and we fought a little over the women

08:58.997 --> 09:00.247
we swiped from each other, but...

09:00.248 --> 09:02.791
- I know, but...
- Sorry, Jimmy boy, but that's life.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.668
Ted, if I'm not the best
manager in the business

09:04.669 --> 09:06.795
I'll eat a garage mechanic's shirt.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.505
Fifteen weeks at the Park Club,

09:08.506 --> 09:10.174
sight unseen, for you and Lila.

09:10.175 --> 09:14.771
$200 a week more than you were
getting with the farmer thrown in.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.185
What's the matter?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.516
I haven't told him.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.310
- You haven't told him?
- You haven't told him?

09:21.311 --> 09:23.896
Haven't told me what? What...
What's this? What's the news?

09:23.897 --> 09:26.315
Well, don't be upset, Jim, dear.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.942
It isn't that I don't love you. I do.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.194
I love everybody,

09:30.195 --> 09:33.697
but when Ted explained how
much he loved me and...

09:33.698 --> 09:37.326
All at once, we both realized
that we belong together.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.495
The two of us, dedicating our lives

09:39.496 --> 09:41.580
to making people happy with our feet.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.165
The two of you, huh?

09:43.166 --> 09:46.335
Dedicating your lives to making
people happy with your feet.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.338
That's sweet.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.298
Well, I guess that kick I just
got was a good start, huh?

09:51.299 --> 09:53.592
Sorry, Jimmy boy, but that's life.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.260
Yeah, it's best that you
found out now, Jim.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.012
You wouldn't wanna make Lila unhappy.

09:57.013 --> 10:00.140
Oh, no. No, I... I wouldn't
want to make Lila unhappy.

10:00.141 --> 10:03.644
Not now, now that I really know her.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.148
What a narrow squeak that was.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.191
What do you mean by that?

10:09.192 --> 10:11.527
Oh, nothing. Nothing, honey.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.986
I'm just happy that you're happy.

10:12.987 --> 10:16.657
That little speech sounds like the
crack of a confederate money.

10:16.658 --> 10:20.202
Well, kids, I'm still gonna
rejoin the human race.

10:20.203 --> 10:23.413
I hope you get a lot of work,
holidays included,

10:23.414 --> 10:27.134
dance yourselves into
beautiful nervous breakdowns.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.546
You ever want to look me up,
you know where to find me,

10:30.547 --> 10:34.967
Midville, Connecticut,
under a large shady tree,

10:34.968 --> 10:37.186
just being lazy.

10:37.804 --> 10:43.481
Lazy, I want to be lazy

10:44.144 --> 10:48.188
I long to be out in the sun

10:48.189 --> 10:51.733
With no work to be done

10:51.734 --> 10:54.862
Under that awning

10:54.863 --> 10:58.699
They call the sky

10:58.700 --> 11:01.953
Stretching and yawning

11:02.328 --> 11:06.373
And let the world go drifting by

11:06.374 --> 11:08.500
I want to peep

11:08.501 --> 11:10.335
Through the deep

11:10.336 --> 11:13.130
Tangled wildwood

11:13.131 --> 11:17.217
Counting sheep till I sleep

11:17.218 --> 11:20.437
Like a child would

11:20.972 --> 11:24.850
With a great big valise full

11:24.851 --> 11:27.895
Of books to read where it's peaceful

11:27.896 --> 11:31.607
While I'm killing time

11:31.608 --> 11:35.829
Being lazy

12:26.496 --> 12:28.872
So Lazy Acres was a snare
and a delusion, huh?

12:28.873 --> 12:32.000
Oh, brother, there's the
hardest work in the world.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.336
Maybe you'd be happier
back in town, Jim.

12:34.337 --> 12:36.380
Of course, if you get that
agricultural urge again,

12:36.381 --> 12:38.006
you can always raise a geranium.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.425
Oh, no. Wait till you hear.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.386
I think I've dreamed up the
greatest idea I ever had.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.679
And you've had some pips.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.972
Oh, but this can't miss.

12:44.973 --> 12:48.267
I'm turning the farm into
an inn, but what an inn.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.146
Here, read up, brother.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.027
"Holiday Inn, Midville Connecticut."

13:01.197 --> 13:02.864
- Open holidays only?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.116
Say, how many of those are there?

13:04.117 --> 13:06.034
There's about 15.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.787
That gives me 350 days
a year to kick around in.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.247
He would think of that.

13:10.248 --> 13:13.166
Did you get your discharge
papers from that sanitarium?

13:13.167 --> 13:15.919
Oh, don't you worry,
this is gonna work.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.338
I'm having auditions out
at the farm every day.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.548
Say, if you run into any talent

13:19.549 --> 13:20.757
that's willing to work for
a share of the table,

13:20.758 --> 13:21.925
will you send them out?

13:21.926 --> 13:23.552
Sure, soon as I get back.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.137
I'm flying down to
Miami Beach tonight

13:25.138 --> 13:27.556
to set an engagement
for Ted and Lila.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.765
Lila.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.267
You forgot to order the flowers.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.477
Now, don't get excited, there's
a flower shop out at the airport.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.188
I guarantee to have orchids in her
dressing room before her first number.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.565
Oh, boy, you better.

13:36.566 --> 13:39.609
As I remember, this kid even
expects presents on Father's Day.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.819
Yeah.

13:40.820 --> 13:44.114
Well, good luck, Jim.
So long, Ted. Have a nice trip.

13:44.115 --> 13:46.868
I mean, yeah, thanks, I will.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.911
That reminds me,
I forgot to give him a little

13:49.912 --> 13:51.747
Christmas remembrance
I brought along.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.216
Got one here for each of you.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.424
Say, this is swell.

13:57.879 --> 13:58.920
What is it?

13:58.921 --> 14:00.547
It's homemade peach preserves.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.050
I put them up myself, just before
I went into the sanitarium.

14:03.051 --> 14:07.637
Boy, do I go for those.
Why, they're great on...

14:07.638 --> 14:08.930
Or even plain.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.099
They're non-fattening, too.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.810
Well, it's a long trip back to
the farm, I think I'll get along.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.312
Will you say hello to Lila for me?

14:15.313 --> 14:16.772
But you gotta wait and catch the act.

14:16.773 --> 14:20.277
We got some new routines
and then after the show...

14:27.283 --> 14:30.832
I don't think they like
this nightclub air.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.754
Wait. Wait. You better
wait for Lila's.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.097
I think Danny's was the loudest.

14:50.098 --> 14:52.145
Well, different tone.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.938
Dawn patrol, huh?

15:02.318 --> 15:04.152
Hello! Am I too late?

15:04.153 --> 15:06.326
You would have been
in another minute.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.873
Danny Reed.

15:14.205 --> 15:15.997
Listen, I have to wait on that man.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.083
- But...
- I'll work five nights for you. Anything.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.962
Just leave me alone
and don't butt in.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.340
What would you like?

15:25.341 --> 15:27.134
Orchids, the finest you've got.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.176
Corsage?

15:28.177 --> 15:29.845
No. No. A dozen.

15:29.846 --> 15:32.556
Loose, looking like they don't care.

15:32.557 --> 15:33.682
All right.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.726
There, "Lila, love, Ted."

15:36.727 --> 15:38.645
Have them delivered
to Miss Lila Dixon

15:38.646 --> 15:40.897
at the Club Pierre
before 11:00 tonight.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.775
Oh, I'm sorry, but our delivery
truck is on its last trip

15:43.776 --> 15:46.904
and won't be back until after 11:00.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.197
How about a messenger boy?

15:49.198 --> 15:52.367
Oh, it's impossible to guarantee
delivery this late on Christmas Eve.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.370
But to help you out, I'll take them.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.497
Oh, there you are.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.124
A dozen orchids, please.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.542
Lady, you're a lifesaver.

16:00.543 --> 16:03.879
Here. Here's $5. Take your boyfriend
out and show him a good time.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.840
Oh, thank you, but let's
consider this a personal favor.

16:06.841 --> 16:09.009
Well, I can't leave town
indebted to a stranger.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.844
Would you like to see the
floor show at the club tonight?

16:10.845 --> 16:12.012
Oh, I'd like to very much, but...

16:12.013 --> 16:14.431
All right, now you just
give this card to Francois

16:14.432 --> 16:17.685
and he'll seat you at
the entertainer's table.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.478
Why, you're Mr. Reed.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.604
Uh-oh.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.607
I'm Linda Mason. Well,
this is just a part-time job.

16:23.608 --> 16:26.067
Actually, I sing and dance.
Mr. Reed, I want...

16:26.068 --> 16:28.653
I know. I know, you've studied
dancing since you were a little child.

16:28.654 --> 16:31.656
You spent long weary hours in every
theatrical agency in Broadway.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.409
But just now I happen to
be catching a plane to...

16:34.410 --> 16:36.620
Of course, once you
told me I was no good,

16:36.621 --> 16:39.623
I could probably get a job at a
bargain basement and like it.

16:39.624 --> 16:42.250
Now look, honestly,
as soon as I get...

16:42.251 --> 16:47.088
Oh, of course. Sure, you worked
hard, you want a chance.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.965
So what? So I'm gonna give it to you.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.133
- A job?
- Uh-huh.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.593
A friend of mine is opening a place

16:51.594 --> 16:53.220
in Connecticut, Holiday Inn.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.763
You take that card
out there tomorrow,

16:54.764 --> 16:57.516
tell him I sent you
and you'll be all set.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.518
Mr. Reed, how could
I possibly thank you?

16:59.519 --> 17:03.444
Don't. Just deliver those orchids
and let me catch my plane.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.705
This table's reserved for the band.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.541
Excuse me!

17:23.542 --> 17:25.761
Fussy, isn't he?

17:27.505 --> 17:30.554
I think I'll have
a bowl of coffee, huh?

17:32.718 --> 17:35.186
- And the lady?
- Coffee.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.448
We seem to be on the
40-cent tour here.

17:55.449 --> 17:56.950
It is embarrassing.

17:56.951 --> 17:58.201
I'm Jim Hardy.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.874
Linda Mason.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.831
Got a friend in the show?

18:02.832 --> 18:04.916
Well, I'm here at
Mr. Reed's invitation.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.794
Oh, Danny.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.170
Then you know Ted Hanover.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.089
What?

18:11.090 --> 18:12.632
Yes, naturally.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.842
Oh, my.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.177
He's quite a man with
the ladies, that Ted.

18:16.178 --> 18:20.056
Well, after all, he's a
very attractive man.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.182
Do you know him?

18:21.183 --> 18:23.059
Oh, yes. Yes.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.894
Matter of fact,
I've been considering Ted

18:24.895 --> 18:26.730
and his partner for my new club.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.189
Oh, you have a place.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.774
Oh, yes. Yes.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.360
I don't know, though.
His act might not go

18:32.361 --> 18:34.863
so well at a place as large as mine.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.072
Oh.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.575
Well, I've found that the size
of a place doesn't matter,

18:38.576 --> 18:41.244
if one has sufficient personality.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.705
That's what you found, huh?

18:43.706 --> 18:46.300
You in show business?

18:46.542 --> 18:48.209
I'm Linda Mason.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.259
Oh, Linda Mason.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.820
I could dance nightly

19:15.821 --> 19:18.448
Just holding you tightly

19:18.449 --> 19:20.951
My sweet

19:21.494 --> 19:23.953
I could keep right on

19:23.954 --> 19:28.254
Because you're so light on your feet

19:29.460 --> 19:34.386
You're easy to dance with

19:34.715 --> 19:36.925
There is no doubt in

19:36.926 --> 19:42.182
The way we stand out in the crowd

19:42.682 --> 19:45.058
Though it's called dancing

19:45.059 --> 19:50.110
To me it's romancing out loud

19:50.815 --> 19:55.786
You're easy to dance with

19:55.820 --> 19:57.904
Loving you the way I do

19:57.905 --> 20:01.241
Makes you easy to dance with

20:01.242 --> 20:05.042
That is why I'm always
right on the beat

20:06.539 --> 20:08.748
All those charms in one man's arms

20:08.749 --> 20:11.835
Make you easy to dance with

20:11.836 --> 20:16.057
I can hardly keep my mind on my feet

20:17.133 --> 20:19.509
Let's dance forever

20:19.510 --> 20:24.472
Come on, say we'll never be through

20:24.473 --> 20:29.854
It's so easy to dance with you

20:46.579 --> 20:51.505
You're easy to dance with

21:07.892 --> 21:12.522
You're easy to dance with

21:41.008 --> 21:46.435
It's so easy to dance with you

21:47.181 --> 21:50.225
It's so easy to dance

21:50.226 --> 21:54.020
It's so easy to dance

21:54.021 --> 21:57.398
With you

22:00.820 --> 22:02.320
That was wonderful.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.780
Oh, it's a great act,
isn't it? Here they come.

22:03.781 --> 22:06.449
- Who?
- Ted and Lila.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.952
Hey, what's the matter?

22:09.245 --> 22:10.662
- Hello, Lila.
- Jimmy boy.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.121
- How are you?
- I'm so glad to see you.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.206
It's good to see you.

22:13.207 --> 22:14.749
I thought you were alone, Jim.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.251
Who's your friend,
and what's her hurry?

22:16.252 --> 22:18.545
Don't ask me, she's your friend.

22:18.546 --> 22:19.712
- Mine?
- Yeah.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.673
What is she afraid of? Facing me?

22:21.674 --> 22:22.799
Darling, I swear, I never...

22:22.800 --> 22:23.883
"Darling, I swear."

22:23.884 --> 22:24.926
You lie...

22:24.927 --> 22:26.679
You're on.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.830
So this is Holiday Inn.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.291
Yeah. Will be if it ever opens up.

22:56.292 --> 22:57.917
Well, why shouldn't it open?

22:57.918 --> 22:59.085
Well, I ain't one to talk,

22:59.086 --> 23:00.795
but you could probably
buy a half interest

23:00.796 --> 23:02.839
in this place for a barrel of apples.

23:02.840 --> 23:07.095
Next train for New York's at
7:43, if I can flag her down.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.852
Say, I'm looking for a job.
Where's the boss?

23:15.853 --> 23:19.072
Right here, I'll be down in a second.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.529
So, you're the big shot

23:26.530 --> 23:28.156
that didn't know whether
Hanover and Dixon

23:28.157 --> 23:29.741
were good enough for your place.

23:29.742 --> 23:33.161
Well, that wasn't exactly hay
you were throwing, either.

23:33.162 --> 23:34.871
"I'm Linda Mason."

23:34.872 --> 23:37.206
Merry Christmas.

23:37.207 --> 23:39.167
All right, you're a
fake and I'm a phony.

23:39.168 --> 23:40.543
And we're both soaked.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.420
- Are you hurt?
- I'll check later.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.797
Come on, let's get out of
this before you catch cold.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.595
All right. Ooh.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.636
Well, here's what cooks.

23:49.637 --> 23:51.184
Oh.

23:53.307 --> 23:54.933
Well, this is darling.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.768
Was it as large as this
when it was a farmhouse?

23:56.769 --> 23:59.437
Yeah, it was built by a fellow
who felt cramped in New York.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.272
He finally ran out of lumber, though.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.523
Oh, Mamie.

24:02.524 --> 24:04.241
Coming.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.407
Is your names Mamie?

24:11.408 --> 24:12.575
- No.
- No.

24:12.576 --> 24:15.124
Get back in the kitchen.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.167
My, my. What's happened?

24:21.168 --> 24:22.835
Oh, we had a little accident.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.921
- Mamie, this is Miss Linda Mason.
- How do you do?

24:24.922 --> 24:26.464
Please to know you, Miss Linda.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.674
And these are her children.

24:27.675 --> 24:29.717
That's Daphne, and that's Vanderbilt.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.811
How do you do?

24:32.054 --> 24:33.888
Mamie, will you take Miss
Mason up to the guest room

24:33.889 --> 24:35.390
and change her into
anything that'll fit her

24:35.391 --> 24:36.891
while we get her clothes dry, huh?

24:36.892 --> 24:39.143
Sure thing, Mr. Jimmy.
Come on, honey.

24:39.144 --> 24:43.399
I'll see about getting the
fire ready in the living room.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.402
Is your names Miss Linda?

24:47.403 --> 24:49.280
- No.
- No.

24:58.664 --> 25:02.166
I don't know, it sounds like
something you dream about at night

25:02.167 --> 25:04.377
and it would be wonderful,

25:04.378 --> 25:06.713
then you'd wake up in the morning
and realize it couldn't work.

25:06.714 --> 25:09.716
Oh, it'll work, if I can sell
the idea to some performers.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.759
They seem to think
that profit sharing

25:11.760 --> 25:13.761
means taking bows on
an empty stomach.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.888
So that's why you're
not open tonight.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.057
Well, I'm also, sort of, particular

25:18.058 --> 25:20.606
about the kind of
talent I'm gonna use.

25:21.729 --> 25:22.937
Fifteen holidays a year.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.147
Mmm-hmm.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.773
You're a lazy fellow.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.400
No, not especially.

25:27.401 --> 25:29.694
Just have my own ideas about living.

25:29.695 --> 25:33.698
My father was like you.
Just a man with a family.

25:33.699 --> 25:37.035
Never amounted to much, didn't care.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.453
But as long as he was alive

25:38.454 --> 25:41.247
we always had plenty to eat
and clothes to keep us warm.

25:41.248 --> 25:42.999
- Were you happy?
- Yes.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.212
Then your father was a very
successful man. Hope I can do as well.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.965
Say, I came out here for
a job. Could you use me?

25:50.966 --> 25:52.884
Well, I might find a spot for you

25:52.885 --> 25:54.260
in my first show. What can you do?

25:54.261 --> 25:56.471
I sing a little and dance.

25:56.472 --> 25:59.057
Couldn't guarantee
any salary at first,

25:59.058 --> 26:01.184
right now I've got the
ledger and an iron lung.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.811
I don't care if you pay off in
eggs, just give me a chance.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.313
Well, let's see what you can do.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.731
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.649
You know, I've written
special music for each holiday.

26:08.650 --> 26:12.153
This sort of gives me a chance to
keep a little promise I made to myself.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.280
I said I was gonna sing
this song at the inn tonight.

26:18.243 --> 26:22.080
I'm dreaming

26:22.081 --> 26:26.959
Of a white Christmas

26:26.960 --> 26:33.382
Just like the ones I used to know

26:33.383 --> 26:37.595
Where the treetops glisten

26:37.596 --> 26:41.891
And children listen

26:41.892 --> 26:49.367
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

26:50.901 --> 26:54.654
I'm dreaming

26:54.655 --> 26:59.535
Of a white Christmas

26:59.910 --> 27:06.916
With every Christmas card I write

27:06.917 --> 27:14.392
May your days be merry and bright

27:16.927 --> 27:24.392
And may all your Christmases

27:24.393 --> 27:28.568
Be white

27:31.567 --> 27:35.194
I'm dreaming

27:35.195 --> 27:39.699
Of a white Christmas

27:39.700 --> 27:40.992
Just like...

27:40.993 --> 27:44.537
Just like the ones I used to know

27:44.538 --> 27:47.039
Where the treetops glisten.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.668
Where the treetops glisten

27:50.669 --> 27:51.878
And children listen.

27:51.879 --> 27:56.007
And children listen

27:56.008 --> 27:58.342
To hear

27:58.343 --> 28:04.065
Sleigh bells in the snow

28:06.185 --> 28:13.608
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

28:14.693 --> 28:20.996
With every Christmas card I write

28:22.326 --> 28:28.247
May your days be merry

28:28.248 --> 28:33.754
And bright

28:34.254 --> 28:38.925
And may all your

28:38.926 --> 28:42.637
Christmases

28:42.638 --> 28:49.942
Be white

29:40.737 --> 29:44.407
Happy holiday

29:44.408 --> 29:48.077
Happy holiday

29:48.078 --> 29:52.248
While the merry bells keep ringing

29:52.249 --> 29:55.918
May your every wish come true

29:55.919 --> 30:03.217
Happy holiday

30:03.218 --> 30:07.179
May the calendar keep bringing

30:07.180 --> 30:11.605
Happy holidays to you

30:12.686 --> 30:15.146
If you're burdened down with trouble

30:15.147 --> 30:17.523
If your nerves are wearing thin

30:17.524 --> 30:19.859
Park your load down the road

30:19.860 --> 30:22.695
And come to Holiday Inn

30:22.696 --> 30:25.364
If the traffic noise affects you

30:25.365 --> 30:27.616
Like a squeaky violin

30:27.617 --> 30:30.077
Kick your cares down the stairs

30:30.078 --> 30:32.538
And come to Holiday Inn

30:32.539 --> 30:35.416
If you can't find somebody who

30:35.417 --> 30:37.543
Would set your heart a-whirl

30:37.544 --> 30:40.254
Get in your car and motor to

30:40.255 --> 30:42.923
The home of boy meets girl

30:42.924 --> 30:45.760
If you're laid-up with a breakdown

30:45.761 --> 30:47.595
Throw away your vitamin

30:47.596 --> 30:49.013
Don't get worse

30:49.014 --> 30:50.348
Grab your nurse

30:50.349 --> 30:53.100
And come to Holiday Inn

30:53.101 --> 30:59.950
Happy holiday

31:00.650 --> 31:04.779
May the calendar keep bringing

31:04.780 --> 31:09.950
Happy holidays to you

31:11.953 --> 31:14.455
Happy New Year, Ted.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.813
No!

31:36.686 --> 31:38.687
Francois, have you seen Mr. Hanover?

31:38.688 --> 31:39.814
Twice, sir.

31:39.815 --> 31:40.898
What happened?

31:40.899 --> 31:42.191
The first time, sir,

31:42.192 --> 31:44.527
he came from his dressing room
with a telegram in his hand.

31:44.528 --> 31:47.530
He ordered Scotch and soda,
a bottle of each.

31:47.531 --> 31:49.073
I know, I know. What then?

31:49.074 --> 31:50.658
The second time he came
from his dressing room

31:50.659 --> 31:53.035
he asked which way is Connecticut.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.745
- Connecticut?
- Connecticut.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.832
He said he has a friend there
who knows about women, too.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.708
Why didn't you stop him?

31:59.709 --> 32:01.627
How could I stop him,
sir, when I don't know

32:01.628 --> 32:04.631
which way is Connecticut.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.842
Who said Holiday Inn wouldn't work?

32:07.843 --> 32:10.803
Well, we're gonna divvy up a stack
of important money tonight, huh?

32:10.804 --> 32:12.054
Man, man.

32:12.055 --> 32:14.223
I've got a landlady who's gonna
ask for your autographed picture.

32:14.224 --> 32:15.349
No.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.143
Everybody get something?

32:18.228 --> 32:19.478
All right, come on, now.

32:19.479 --> 32:20.688
Go to bed, now, it's getting late.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.907
- Good night.
- Good night.

32:27.362 --> 32:29.488
Look, it's almost time.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.824
Say, it's practically
straight up, isn't it?

32:31.825 --> 32:34.618
One minute to midnight

32:34.619 --> 32:36.954
One minute to go

32:36.955 --> 32:39.331
One minute to say good-bye

32:39.332 --> 32:42.918
Before we say hello

32:42.919 --> 32:45.713
Let's start the new year right

32:45.714 --> 32:48.048
Twelve o'clock tonight

32:48.049 --> 32:50.551
When they dim the light

32:50.552 --> 32:53.180
Let's begin

32:53.638 --> 32:58.267
Kissing the old year out

32:58.268 --> 33:01.770
Kissing the new year in

33:01.771 --> 33:04.648
Let's watch the old year die

33:04.649 --> 33:06.942
With a fond good-bye

33:06.943 --> 33:09.403
And our hopes as high

33:09.404 --> 33:11.656
As a kite

33:12.157 --> 33:15.493
How can our love go wrong if

33:15.494 --> 33:20.414
We start the new year right?

33:22.417 --> 33:23.626
That's it. That's midnight.

33:23.627 --> 33:25.002
I'll see you out on
the floor, all right?

33:25.003 --> 33:27.255
All right.

33:29.174 --> 33:31.425
Come on, everybody. Happy New Year.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.519
Happy holiday.

33:40.602 --> 33:42.399
Happy New Year.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.661
I forgot my check.

33:58.662 --> 34:01.915
You won't need that, but I
think you'll need your coat.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.126
Happy New Year.

34:06.127 --> 34:07.924
Same to you.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.714
You got to dance.
Oh, you got to dance.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.675
Come on, you got to...

34:44.081 --> 34:45.879
Why, Mr. Hanover.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.167
Mr. Hanover.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.293
That's Mr. Hanover.

34:48.295 --> 34:49.670
Wait a minute, I got to go.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.338
Oh, no, I don't want Ted Hanover,

34:51.339 --> 34:52.840
I want you. This is New Years, kid.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.388
I know.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.194
Ted!

37:19.529 --> 37:21.739
He wasn't drunk, it's a gag.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.031
What happened?

37:23.032 --> 37:24.241
Ted Hanover with his new partner.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.617
They were great.

37:25.618 --> 37:27.335
New partner?

37:34.461 --> 37:35.627
You better get back.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.713
Well, I am sorry, if I'd
have known how he was...

37:37.714 --> 37:41.809
Oh, he'll be all right in a week
or 10 days. You better hurry.

37:48.391 --> 37:50.063
Ted!

37:50.310 --> 37:52.027
Ted!

37:52.270 --> 37:53.771
Ted!

37:53.772 --> 37:55.364
Oh.

37:55.774 --> 37:56.857
How is he?

37:56.858 --> 37:58.150
He's out cold.

37:58.151 --> 38:01.871
Hot or cold, he can keep his
dancing shoes in my office.

38:02.197 --> 38:03.405
Did you hear that applause?

38:03.406 --> 38:04.531
Yeah, it went pretty good.

38:04.532 --> 38:07.409
And I was worried
about his losing Lila.

38:07.410 --> 38:08.911
- Losing Lila?
- Yeah.

38:08.912 --> 38:11.163
Yeah, she eloped tonight
with some Texan from Texas,

38:11.164 --> 38:13.749
with Ted's engagement
ring on her finger.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.000
But who cares?

38:15.001 --> 38:17.879
You lose one girl,
you find another. That's life.

38:17.921 --> 38:19.798
That's good, huh?

38:19.881 --> 38:22.258
Here we go again.

38:33.269 --> 38:35.567
Come in.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.565
- Good morning, Ted.
- Oh. Good morning.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.660
Got a little head?

38:42.403 --> 38:43.570
Where am I?

38:43.571 --> 38:45.072
You're at Holiday Inn.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.907
Well, how did I get here?
Who brought me?

38:46.908 --> 38:50.160
You were clinging to the
undercarriage of a jeep, I think.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.755
Here, have a slug out of the mug.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.008
- You mean you don't remember anything?
- Uh...

38:56.835 --> 39:00.714
Let's see. I had a wire from Lila

39:01.464 --> 39:03.382
telling me she's going to marry
some millionaire or something.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.676
- I remember that all right.
- Mmm-hmm.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.094
Then I had a drink.

39:07.095 --> 39:08.596
A drink?

39:08.805 --> 39:10.978
Boy, you were fractured.

39:11.015 --> 39:15.019
And then I decided I had
to talk to my old pal, Jim.

39:15.395 --> 39:17.187
You don't remember anything else?

39:17.188 --> 39:19.531
No. That's all, except that

39:19.774 --> 39:22.442
I must have been killed on the
way out here or something.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.278
You really come up empty, huh?

39:24.279 --> 39:26.281
Too bad about Lila.

39:26.406 --> 39:28.323
I think you're better
off doing a single.

39:28.324 --> 39:29.658
You're a born soloist, you know.

39:29.659 --> 39:31.326
Oh, no, no, Jim, I've
got to have a partner.

39:31.327 --> 39:32.536
And when I find her...

39:32.537 --> 39:33.912
Yeah, I know,
you'll fall in love with her.

39:33.913 --> 39:35.956
- You haven't missed yet.
- Happy New Year!

39:35.957 --> 39:37.583
Oh, don't do that.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.210
Why didn't you tell me?

39:40.211 --> 39:43.213
Letting me beat my brains out
worrying about his losing Lila

39:43.214 --> 39:45.716
and all the time, he's got
this girl on the leash.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.718
What girl?

39:47.719 --> 39:49.344
Boy, you must have been high.

39:49.345 --> 39:50.888
Doing a complete dance routine

39:50.889 --> 39:53.437
with your new partner and you...

39:54.225 --> 39:56.351
You don't know who she is?

39:56.352 --> 39:58.145
I danced with a new partner?

39:58.146 --> 39:59.813
When? Where?

39:59.814 --> 40:02.066
Here. Last night.

40:02.108 --> 40:04.906
Think, Ted. Remember?

40:06.404 --> 40:09.156
Wait a minute. I remember.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.830
I got here just about midnight.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.707
There was a girl.

40:14.996 --> 40:16.622
We danced.

40:16.998 --> 40:19.000
What she look like?

40:21.085 --> 40:24.930
I... I don't know. All I
saw was a vague outline.

40:25.048 --> 40:27.926
Can't you remember
anything about her?

40:28.134 --> 40:29.760
I remember dancing with her.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.011
If I ever dance with her again,

40:31.012 --> 40:32.930
I'd probably recognize her.

40:32.931 --> 40:36.266
Great, that takes care of
everything but finding her.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.226
You were here, why ask
me how she looked?

40:38.227 --> 40:40.729
I only saw her from
the back. She was...

40:40.730 --> 40:42.397
About this...

40:42.398 --> 40:44.150
She had a...

40:44.275 --> 40:46.443
If I ever saw her from the
back again, I'd recognize her.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.986
Well, that's fine.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.237
After I've danced with her,

40:49.238 --> 40:51.323
I'll just turn her
around for your okay.

40:51.324 --> 40:53.451
This should be a cinch.

40:55.203 --> 40:56.995
You saw her, describe her.

40:56.996 --> 41:01.333
Who, me? Well, I wasn't
watching very closely.

41:01.334 --> 41:04.711
She was a medium...
Medium-built sort of a girl,

41:04.712 --> 41:07.422
with a medium face. She had
a nice evening gown on

41:07.423 --> 41:09.049
with a belt in the back.

41:09.050 --> 41:11.301
See, she was built just
like a girl friend of mine.

41:11.302 --> 41:14.137
A girl you don't know but her
name was Consuela Stupkis.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.765
She used to play the pinball machine
a lot down at the corner drugstore.

41:16.766 --> 41:19.768
I remember one time she was
high man. Three weeks in a row.

41:19.769 --> 41:22.604
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

41:22.605 --> 41:25.732
That's nothing at all,
happy to do it.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.609
See, I got a hunch, fellas.

41:27.610 --> 41:30.112
I've got a hunch we're going
to find this girl eventually.

41:30.113 --> 41:32.781
And when we do we'll be
glad we waited for her.

41:32.782 --> 41:37.077
Listen, I'm not interested in getting
any other partner, understand?

41:37.078 --> 41:40.878
A chance meeting
in the night. Destiny.

41:41.541 --> 41:42.749
She'll be back.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.844
Here's where we will find
her on the next holiday.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.138
- Here?
- Here.

41:49.382 --> 41:51.884
I've got to go turn the roast.

42:42.643 --> 42:45.316
Now don't worry, we'll find her.

42:45.354 --> 42:48.106
If I see her from the back again,
I'll recognize her.

42:48.107 --> 42:51.827
It's kind of a roundabout way
to go at it, but let's try it.

43:09.045 --> 43:11.171
Are you decent?

43:11.172 --> 43:13.049
Yes, come in.

43:14.467 --> 43:15.842
What's that?

43:15.843 --> 43:17.219
Well, I thought it over

43:17.220 --> 43:19.846
and I believe that our number'll
go a little better in blackface.

43:19.847 --> 43:22.182
Oh. I thought we were
going to do it like this.

43:22.183 --> 43:25.402
Well, that's before...
Before I thought it over.

43:25.895 --> 43:27.854
- I look terrible in the stuff.
- No.

43:27.855 --> 43:29.523
I don't even know how to put it on.

43:29.524 --> 43:31.441
I'll put it on for you.

43:31.442 --> 43:34.115
I broke in as a bootblack, you know.

43:34.362 --> 43:36.079
Here we go.

43:36.864 --> 43:38.198
Oh.

43:38.199 --> 43:39.991
For a month and a half
I've been dreaming

43:39.992 --> 43:42.244
of how pretty I was
going to look tonight.

43:42.245 --> 43:45.622
Well, here's my punishment
for thinking so well of myself.

43:45.623 --> 43:48.083
Oh, you'll have plenty
of times to be pretty.

43:48.084 --> 43:49.835
I was just going to
ask you if you'd like

43:49.836 --> 43:51.586
to be in the rest of
the shows out here.

43:51.587 --> 43:53.259
You were?

43:53.297 --> 43:55.595
- Will you?
- Will I?

43:56.300 --> 43:59.219
Fifteen nights a year Cinderella
steps into her pumpkin coach

43:59.220 --> 44:01.893
and becomes queen of Holiday Inn.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.600
Well, what's the matter?

44:05.601 --> 44:07.561
I wish I didn't have to work
all the other days in the year

44:07.562 --> 44:10.147
to make these few possible.

44:10.148 --> 44:13.822
Maybe a little later on
when we start doing better

44:14.569 --> 44:16.736
you could stay out here all the time.

44:16.737 --> 44:18.405
Did you hear what you just said?

44:18.406 --> 44:20.374
Yeah.

44:20.616 --> 44:23.118
Was it a proposal?

44:23.619 --> 44:26.872
It will be when I get a
few bucks in the bank.

44:26.914 --> 44:29.166
You're a strange duck.

44:29.167 --> 44:31.251
You don't even give me
a chance to say darling

44:31.252 --> 44:33.587
and throw my arms around you.

44:33.588 --> 44:36.381
Better save that till
you see the bankbook.

44:36.382 --> 44:39.761
Well, I guess I'm sort of engaged.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.868
Say, what is this? A daisy chain?

45:07.580 --> 45:12.005
Well, we were just looking for
the back of a girl we don't know.

45:40.863 --> 45:44.324
Upon a February morn

45:44.325 --> 45:46.701
A tiny baby boy was born

45:46.702 --> 45:49.000
Abraham

45:49.664 --> 45:52.462
Abraham

45:52.625 --> 45:55.669
When he growed up, this tiny babe

45:55.670 --> 45:58.546
Folks all called him Honest Abe

45:58.547 --> 46:00.594
Abraham

46:01.384 --> 46:03.477
Abraham

46:04.345 --> 46:07.222
In 1860, he became

46:07.223 --> 46:10.141
The sixteenth president

46:10.142 --> 46:12.978
And now he's in the hall of fame

46:12.979 --> 46:16.356
A most respected gent

46:16.357 --> 46:19.067
That's why we celebrate

46:19.068 --> 46:21.861
This blessed February date

46:21.862 --> 46:24.285
Abraham

46:24.865 --> 46:27.242
Abraham

46:33.666 --> 46:36.960
When black folks lived in slavery

46:36.961 --> 46:40.046
Who was it set the darkie free?

46:40.047 --> 46:41.423
Abraham

46:41.424 --> 46:42.966
That's right, child.

46:42.967 --> 46:45.635
Abraham

46:45.636 --> 46:48.680
When troubles come
down from the shelf

46:48.681 --> 46:51.891
Who's heart was bigger than hisself?

46:51.892 --> 46:53.727
Abraham

46:53.728 --> 46:54.853
Yeah, ma'am!

46:54.854 --> 46:57.652
Abraham

46:57.940 --> 47:00.734
The country's going to the dogs

47:00.735 --> 47:03.737
They shouted loud and strong

47:03.738 --> 47:06.698
Then from a cabin made out of logs

47:06.699 --> 47:09.743
The right man came along

47:09.744 --> 47:12.662
And that is why we celebrate

47:12.663 --> 47:15.665
This blessed February date

47:15.666 --> 47:21.889
Abraham

47:27.762 --> 47:29.637
The U.S.A.'s united thanks

47:29.638 --> 47:30.722
Yeah

47:30.723 --> 47:32.974
To one whose name was Nancy Hanks

47:32.975 --> 47:34.142
Tell me!

47:34.143 --> 47:39.564
Abraham

47:39.565 --> 47:41.649
She gave this land the finest son

47:41.650 --> 47:42.859
That's what she did.

47:42.860 --> 47:45.111
Who ever went to Washington

47:45.112 --> 47:46.279
Who dat?

47:46.280 --> 47:48.615
Abraham

47:48.616 --> 47:51.369
Abraham

47:51.410 --> 47:54.412
When someone told him General Grant

47:54.413 --> 47:57.248
Was drinking every night

47:57.249 --> 48:00.210
He answered, "Go see if you can't

48:00.211 --> 48:03.430
"Get all my generals tight"

48:03.631 --> 48:06.466
That's why we celebrate

48:06.467 --> 48:09.470
This blessed February date

48:09.678 --> 48:12.055
Abraham

48:12.640 --> 48:15.393
Abraham

48:18.437 --> 48:21.235
Abraham

48:31.409 --> 48:33.081
Good night.

48:35.538 --> 48:38.382
I give up. She's not here tonight.

48:38.916 --> 48:41.793
You wait here, I'll go up
and see if Jim's seen her.

48:41.794 --> 48:43.545
Gus is waiting to take
you to the station.

48:43.546 --> 48:47.175
Remember now, day after tomorrow,
St. Valentine's Day.

48:49.427 --> 48:51.136
Someone's coming, we better
use the other stairway.

48:51.137 --> 48:53.560
- Who is it?
- Bill-collector.

49:05.192 --> 49:07.786
- Good night.
- Good night, Jim.

49:07.820 --> 49:11.698
You better get inside before you
catch cold. You haven't got a coat.

49:11.699 --> 49:13.667
- Well, I...
- Go on.

49:17.621 --> 49:19.247
I don't need a coat now.

49:21.750 --> 49:24.752
Hey, Ted. Did you find the girl?

49:24.753 --> 49:27.422
This is terrible, I wish we could
recognize her from the front.

49:27.423 --> 49:28.715
I feel like a wolf.

49:28.716 --> 49:30.308
Why, Ted.

49:43.814 --> 49:45.406
Ted!

49:46.108 --> 49:47.442
- She's here!
- Who?

49:47.443 --> 49:48.776
- I saw her!
- This way.

49:48.777 --> 49:49.903
Let go of my coat.

49:49.904 --> 49:52.113
This way, shortcut,
shortcut. Come on.

49:52.114 --> 49:53.740
Giddyap.

49:59.455 --> 50:01.414
It's locked, it's never
been locked before.

50:01.415 --> 50:03.883
Let's try the other stairwell.

50:04.168 --> 50:05.293
Let go of me, let go.

50:05.294 --> 50:06.966
Go ahead.

50:12.343 --> 50:14.344
Well, we've lost her again.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.638
Did you get a look at
her face this time?

50:16.639 --> 50:19.390
No, we're still working
from the rear.

50:19.391 --> 50:21.684
How do you know it was her?
After all, she had an overcoat on.

50:21.685 --> 50:23.937
I don't care if she had...

50:23.938 --> 50:26.231
How do you know she
had an overcoat on?

50:26.232 --> 50:28.816
Well, she... If she didn't,

50:28.817 --> 50:30.151
look for a girl with pneumonia.

50:30.152 --> 50:31.824
Come on. Let's get inside.

50:33.572 --> 50:36.115
Say, Jim, when's your next show?

50:36.116 --> 50:39.540
Next show? St. Valentine's
Day, I think.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.412
- Day after tomorrow, huh?
- Is it?

50:41.413 --> 50:43.456
That's our break.
We'll get here bright and early

50:43.457 --> 50:44.624
and stay until we find her.

50:44.625 --> 50:45.792
We'll make an announcement

50:45.793 --> 50:47.168
asking her to identify herself.

50:47.169 --> 50:49.087
- We won't miss next time.
- No.

50:49.088 --> 50:51.297
Say, fellas, how did
you like the show?

50:51.298 --> 50:55.510
Well, we were so busy we didn't
see much of it, Jim. Why?

50:55.511 --> 50:58.012
I thought the people seemed
to like the blackface routine.

50:58.013 --> 50:59.222
Yeah, they did.

50:59.223 --> 51:00.557
Don't you think a blackface number

51:00.558 --> 51:02.725
on St. Valentine's
Day would be novel?

51:02.726 --> 51:04.978
- A what?
- It's no good, eh?

51:04.979 --> 51:06.396
Just an idea I had.

51:06.397 --> 51:07.772
Well, good-bye.

51:07.773 --> 51:08.982
- Good-bye, Ted.
- So long, Jim.

51:08.983 --> 51:10.609
Bye, Dan.

51:22.454 --> 51:24.163
- Hey, lady.
- Yes.

51:24.164 --> 51:27.166
You know we open in an hour.
You haven't even had a rehearsal.

51:27.167 --> 51:28.884
Coming.

51:30.129 --> 51:32.088
Oh, very smart.

51:32.089 --> 51:35.091
You'll have to talk Gus into
buying a horseless carriage.

51:35.092 --> 51:37.210
I spend half my life between
here and the station.

51:38.178 --> 51:42.228
I think Gus will have to face the
machine age sooner or later, won't he?

51:43.434 --> 51:45.101
Did you escape those
bill-collectors the other night?

51:45.102 --> 51:46.269
Bill-collectors?

51:46.270 --> 51:48.021
Oh, yes, temporarily.
Say, that reminds me,

51:48.022 --> 51:49.355
I have a surprise for you downstairs.

51:49.356 --> 51:51.566
Well, thanks. What reminds you?

51:51.567 --> 51:54.777
Nothing, it's just... I mean,
I want you to remember the surprise

51:54.778 --> 51:57.488
when those doggone
bill-collectors move in.

51:57.489 --> 52:00.538
You sound sweet,
but you don't make sense.

52:06.582 --> 52:08.416
The inn is so romantic looking.

52:08.417 --> 52:11.511
Nice? I posed for
those cupids myself.

52:12.421 --> 52:13.588
Hello, boys.

52:13.589 --> 52:15.798
Hi. How are you?

52:15.799 --> 52:17.842
Paid-up cards here tonight.

52:17.843 --> 52:19.719
Where's the surprise?

52:19.720 --> 52:23.770
Aha! Right here, a little
home cooking I whipped up.

52:27.102 --> 52:28.728
Beautiful.

52:33.567 --> 52:35.276
"Be Careful, It's My Heart."

52:35.277 --> 52:37.362
And I ain't kidding, either.

52:37.363 --> 52:38.989
I wrote this just for you, honey.

52:47.998 --> 52:53.675
Be careful, it's my heart

52:54.713 --> 53:00.561
It's not my watch you're
holding, it's my heart

53:01.553 --> 53:05.264
It's not the note I sent you

53:05.265 --> 53:09.065
That you quickly burned

53:09.103 --> 53:12.188
It's not the book I lent you

53:12.189 --> 53:15.733
That you never returned

53:15.734 --> 53:22.617
Remember, it's my heart

53:23.075 --> 53:29.708
The heart with which
so willingly I part

53:29.748 --> 53:33.918
It's yours to take, to keep or break

53:33.919 --> 53:37.547
But please, before you start

53:37.548 --> 53:43.396
Be careful, it's my heart

53:59.319 --> 54:03.449
Be careful, it's my heart

54:05.159 --> 54:10.335
It's not my watch you're
holding, it's my heart

54:11.290 --> 54:14.794
It's not the note I sent you

54:14.918 --> 54:18.755
That you quickly burned

54:18.756 --> 54:22.260
It's not the book I lent you

54:22.301 --> 54:26.851
That you never returned

54:27.389 --> 54:33.612
Remember, it's my heart

54:35.230 --> 54:42.111
The heart with which
so willingly I part

54:42.112 --> 54:46.073
It's yours to take, to keep or break

54:46.074 --> 54:50.745
But please, before you start

54:50.746 --> 54:56.878
Be careful, it's my heart

56:13.537 --> 56:15.162
I'm sorry, Jim, I couldn't resist it.

56:15.163 --> 56:17.415
Wonderful, she's prefect,
light as a feather.

56:17.416 --> 56:18.916
You found her, Jim. You're a pal.

56:18.917 --> 56:20.001
Yeah.

56:20.002 --> 56:21.294
Young lady, do you realize

56:21.295 --> 56:23.045
that we've been searching
for you for weeks?

56:23.046 --> 56:25.389
- For me?
- Yes, ever since...

56:26.300 --> 56:28.050
The girl in the flower shop.

56:28.051 --> 56:29.760
Yes, Mr. Reed.

56:29.761 --> 56:31.721
Where have you been working
since New Year's Eve?

56:31.722 --> 56:33.439
Here.

56:33.765 --> 56:35.850
Would you mind letting
me in on your secret?

56:35.851 --> 56:37.101
Oh, it's no secret.

56:37.102 --> 56:39.228
Ted Hanover is looking for
a new dancing partner

56:39.229 --> 56:40.479
and we've decided
to give you the job.

56:40.480 --> 56:41.772
Oh, here now. Wait, just a minute.

56:41.773 --> 56:43.190
Oh, no hard feelings, Jim,

56:43.191 --> 56:45.276
I don't blame you for trying.
She is wonderful.

56:45.277 --> 56:46.819
I feel as if I've
known her for months.

56:46.820 --> 56:48.863
Oh. Same old feeling, huh?

56:48.864 --> 56:51.490
Let's see, Washington's
Birthday is the next show.

56:51.491 --> 56:54.243
That will give us a week of rehearsals.
We can open the act here.

56:54.244 --> 56:56.621
I'll take care of the invitations.
Strictly formal.

56:56.622 --> 56:58.247
I'll get all the newspaper
boys from New York.

56:58.248 --> 57:00.416
Now hold everything. This is my inn,

57:00.417 --> 57:02.543
and I am not running it for
a bunch of stuffed shirts.

57:02.544 --> 57:04.295
What would you like,
the dungaree set?

57:04.296 --> 57:06.964
Well, that would be better than the
bunch of chowder heads you drag in.

57:06.965 --> 57:08.466
Maybe I can't use the act.

57:08.467 --> 57:10.343
Not use Ted Hanover?

57:10.344 --> 57:12.562
Well, the show is pretty well set.

57:12.930 --> 57:14.263
You're in, but he's out.

57:14.264 --> 57:17.350
But you could change the show
for a special occasion like this.

57:17.351 --> 57:20.186
Of course he could. He's just
trying to hide his gratitude.

57:20.187 --> 57:22.438
Jim, you better think
up a number for us.

57:22.439 --> 57:25.232
Well, just what do
you visualize, Ziggy?

57:25.233 --> 57:27.485
Ah, let's see.

57:27.486 --> 57:31.197
For Washington's birthday I see,
sort of, a romantic costume thing.

57:31.198 --> 57:33.282
- Naturally.
- Something that just reeks

57:33.283 --> 57:35.368
- with grace and charm, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

57:35.369 --> 57:38.746
I think the music should
be sweet and gentle to...

57:38.747 --> 57:42.877
Well, to create the mood, each time
I take her into my arms and kiss her.

57:43.085 --> 57:44.460
That's it.

57:44.461 --> 57:48.056
Don't you think it's getting
a little stuffy in here?

58:37.639 --> 58:40.808
I could say that you're homely

58:40.809 --> 58:43.477
Just as homely as pie

58:43.478 --> 58:46.397
But this is Washington's birthday

58:46.398 --> 58:49.525
And I've got to say you're beautiful

58:49.526 --> 58:53.237
'Cause I can't tell a lie

58:53.238 --> 58:56.198
I could say that you're stupid

58:56.199 --> 58:59.160
Nothing up in your crown

58:59.161 --> 59:02.079
But this is Washington's birthday

59:02.080 --> 59:03.497
And the truthful he

59:03.498 --> 59:04.999
Of the cherry tree

59:05.000 --> 59:08.753
Would look down on me and frown

59:08.754 --> 59:14.341
I could say that I hate you if I try

59:14.342 --> 59:17.428
But I've got to say I love you

59:17.429 --> 59:20.598
'Cause it's February
the twenty-second

59:20.599 --> 59:24.444
And I can't tell a lie

59:49.211 --> 59:50.928
Hit it.

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:11.148
Come in.

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:15.856
Well, honey, in spite of what
good old Jim tried to do to us,

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:17.983
your future starts as of tonight.

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:20.069
Now where would you
like to go from here?

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.445
- From here?
- Yes.

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:24.698
New York, Havana, Rio? We have
our pick of engagements, you know.

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:27.201
But I can't be your partner
if you leave the inn.

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:31.330
Of course you can. There's no reason
for you to remain buried here.

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:33.540
There's a very good reason.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:37.086
I promised to be in Jim's holiday
shows for the rest of the year.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.337
Ah, but he tricked you into that

01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:39.964
while he was hiding you from me.

01:02:39.965 --> 01:02:42.934
No matter how he
did it, I've promised.

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:46.929
Besides, well,
we're going to be married.

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:50.349
Married? Now wait a minute,
let's be fair.

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:51.725
He didn't give me a chance.

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:53.978
After all, I love you, too.

01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:56.188
Linda, from the very first
moment we danced together,

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:59.149
I knew you were to be
the one girl in my life.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:01.698
You didn't even know my name.

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:04.989
Please. All right,
forget about me, then.

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:07.283
Forget about Jim, think of yourself.

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.576
Here's your chance to do
the one thing you like best.

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:12.796
Not only for 15 days
a year, but always.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:17.043
Sorry, but I promised.

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.685
Well?

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:32.891
I guess I should apologize for
hooking up your number, huh?

01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:37.147
Oh, forget it. I'm the one
that should apologize to you.

01:03:37.439 --> 01:03:39.315
Here I've been trying to
take Linda away from you

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:41.108
not knowing you two
were going to be married.

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:42.781
Married?

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:46.160
Yeah, aren't you?

01:03:46.448 --> 01:03:48.825
Yes, sure.

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:52.290
I mean, naturally,
we're sort of engaged.

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:53.913
Oh.

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:58.672
Well, anyway, I've decided to
bow out of here. Linda's all yours.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:01.462
Well, you're a pretty game
guy to take it this way.

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:05.049
Well, it's happened so often I'm
getting used to it, that's all.

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:06.216
Good-bye, kid.

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:07.509
A lot of luck, Ted.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.262
Thanks.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:18.103
How are we doing?

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:20.731
Two minutes ago, I would have
sold my chances for a tired dime.

01:04:20.732 --> 01:04:23.233
But when a man is surprised to
hear that he's going to be married,

01:04:23.234 --> 01:04:26.111
brother, that's when I go to
work with a clear conscience.

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:28.410
- Everything's good, huh?
- Everything is perfect.

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:12.617
In your Easter bonnet

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:16.921
With all the frills upon it

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:20.457
You'll be the grandest lady

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:24.753
In the Easter parade

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:28.674
I'll be all in clover

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:32.302
And when they look you over

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:35.597
I'll be the proudest fellow

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:39.435
In the Easter parade

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:43.110
On the Avenue

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:46.868
Fifth Avenue

01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:50.988
The photographers will snap us

01:05:50.989 --> 01:05:54.158
And you'll find that you're

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:56.912
In the rotogravure

01:05:58.413 --> 01:06:02.042
Oh, I could write a sonnet

01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:06.879
About your Easter bonnet

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:10.466
And of the girl I'm taking

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:14.303
To the Easter parade

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:18.399
On the Avenue

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:22.236
Fifth Avenue

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:26.565
The photographers will snap us

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:30.070
And you'll find that you're

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.614
In the rotogravure

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:39.167
Oh, I could write a sonnet

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:43.373
About your Easter bonnet

01:06:43.374 --> 01:06:47.211
And of the girl I'm taking

01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:53.765
To the Easter parade

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:57.396
Hello!

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:01.016
I didn't exactly expect
the welcome mat,

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.235
but I thought somebody
might say hello.

01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:04.853
- Hello.
- Thanks.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:08.023
What brings you here on this
bright and uninviting day?

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:11.323
I've discovered something,
my friends, about life.

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:12.778
Meaning what?

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:15.447
Well, I don't want success,

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:19.117
I want the true happiness you
people have found here at the inn.

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:20.786
You're not gonna stay in the inn?

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:22.996
Not just stay, I want to
be part of your shows,

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:24.623
help you in your work,

01:07:24.624 --> 01:07:26.797
share your simple pleasures.

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:29.336
I asked you once not
to interfere, Ted.

01:07:29.337 --> 01:07:32.548
Please believe me, I am a tired,
lonely and unhappy man.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:36.677
But I could be happy here, helping
the two people I like the best.

01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:37.803
Will you take me in?

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:38.887
My motherly intuition

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.806
tells me to throw him out.

01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:43.225
Well, at least give him
the benefit of the doubt.

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:45.185
I've given him plenty of doubt.

01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:48.940
Are you kidding with that "sharing
life's simple pleasures"?

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:50.941
May I go inside with you?

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:52.659
Why, of course.

01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:54.945
My... My trunks will
arrive this afternoon.

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:57.072
What do I do?
Move in the broom closet?

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.700
Jim, that's no way to talk to
a man who's here to help you.

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:01.410
The world doesn't change.

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:04.204
A gentle smile often breeds
a kick in the pants.

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:07.504
But for your sake,
Linda, I'll be big.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.937
I'll give you a tip about
these things, Gus.

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.981
They'll go up and back,
but not sideways.

01:08:30.982 --> 01:08:33.024
Yeah, well, I keep forgetting

01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:35.109
this blind thing can't
see where it's going.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:38.822
Yeah, well, unload the rest of
this stuff in the back, huh?

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:48.665
Hey! What did you do,
get up before breakfast?

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:50.375
Why, every morning.
I trust you slept well.

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:51.667
When I found out how late you got in,

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:53.587
I told Mamie to let you sleep.

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.589
- Life on a farm!
- Can't beat it, huh?

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:57.049
Jim, you've made me very happy!

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.300
That's fine.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:00.218
Now, how about you making me happy?

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:02.386
You sound like a landlord
with eviction papers.

01:09:02.388 --> 01:09:04.430
Oh. This is good news,
Lila's back in New York.

01:09:04.432 --> 01:09:06.475
I got a letter from her yesterday.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:07.934
What happened to her millionaire?

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:09.394
Slight mistake there.

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:12.229
He didn't own millions, he owed them.

01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:16.359
Poor girl, always straying to greener
pastures and finding spinach.

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:17.569
Say, she was wondering if you'd

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:19.613
be interested in taking
her back as a partner.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:21.073
I think it'd be a great idea.

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.866
Naturally, you would.

01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:25.035
But I like it here
with you and Linda.

01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:27.537
Yes, and we love having you, too.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.875
Uh, when are you leaving?

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:45.596
- Why didn't you say something?
- You look so silly.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.474
- Where's Jim?
- Inside.

01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:49.935
Good. I've fixed it. Here's the news

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:52.104
in one luscious word: Hollywood!

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:54.898
Now, I told you, I'm not leaving
here until Linda goes with me.

01:09:54.899 --> 01:09:57.275
But this is the setup you needed
to get her away from Jim.

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:58.985
Now, there are going to be two
Hollywood men here tonight

01:09:58.986 --> 01:10:00.112
to see the show.

01:10:00.113 --> 01:10:01.446
One's an important director.

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:03.782
If they like your dancing,
you and Linda

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:06.243
will be on a westbound
train tomorrow.

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:08.537
We better find out
if Linda's interested.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:11.123
We let her know when there's a
contract staring her in the face.

01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:13.208
- Look...
- Now I know you're in love with the girl

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.001
but forget her until we
get her away from here.

01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:16.795
This is no time to be honest.

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:17.963
Well, what should I do?

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:20.173
All we have to do is to convince Jim

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:22.801
that he'd be a heel if he stood
in the way of a chance like this.

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:25.805
Oh, that'll be easy,
like peeling a turtle.

01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:36.189
Mamie says these go up here!

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:38.943
Yes, set them right down.

01:10:40.778 --> 01:10:44.281
Say, Gus, how would you
like to earn a slow $10?

01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:47.159
Well, I don't care
how slow, but sure.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.244
It's sure, all right,
here's the wrinkle,

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.996
I want you to go down to the station

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:53.206
pick up a party and
start for Holiday Inn

01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:55.292
but never get here.
Could you handle that?

01:10:55.293 --> 01:10:56.668
Wouldn't be surprised!

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:59.296
Hello, long distance.

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:01.423
That's what I want you
to do with Linda Mason.

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:03.800
Miss Mason? Our friend?

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:06.178
You're not supposed
to understand it, Gus.

01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:10.015
For that kind of money you ought to
be able to go by way of Medicine Hat.

01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:12.644
Hello, yeah. Just a minute.

01:11:15.146 --> 01:11:18.398
Long distance, I want
to get Parkway Hotel,

01:11:18.399 --> 01:11:21.402
New York City, Miss Lila Dixon.

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:46.343
Didn't Linda say she'd be
here for final rehearsal?

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:50.269
Oh, relax, our audiences
aren't professional critics.

01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:07.823
Gus, you made a wrong turn.

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:09.541
Shortcut.

01:12:13.412 --> 01:12:14.621
Gus!

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:16.544
Shortcut, another shortcut.

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.518
How could you possibly expect
to drive through this?

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:39.363
Well, I never had no
trouble with a horse.

01:12:42.316 --> 01:12:43.859
Oh, you'd better carry me to shore,

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.610
and I'll walk back to the highway.

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:48.822
Well, I think you'd be better
off waiting right here.

01:12:48.823 --> 01:12:51.917
Gus, will you please do as I say?

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.707
Oh, all right.

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:02.127
- The other way.
- Huh?

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:06.223
Turn around. Gus, turn around!

01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:08.138
Oh!

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:12.224
Gus!

01:13:14.974 --> 01:13:16.808
- My hat!
- You pushed me.

01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:18.481
Get my hat!

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:26.318
I swear the show will
start any minute now.

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:28.612
You said that an hour ago.

01:13:28.613 --> 01:13:32.617
Yeah, but this time
I'm sincere. Excuse me.

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.349
Who started the show?

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:58.683
I did. You're on.

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:00.018
But what about Ted's partner?

01:14:00.019 --> 01:14:02.729
You've kept this crowd waiting long
enough, he can go on without her.

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:04.606
Have you gone nuts?
I've rehearsed a double dance.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:09.736
Let's say it with firecrackers
and banners held high

01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:15.325
Let's have a real old-fashioned
noisy Fourth of July

01:14:15.326 --> 01:14:17.869
Let's say it with firecrackers

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:20.121
They'll jump at up North

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:25.502
Let's have the kind we used
to call a glorious Fourth

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:28.088
Let's salute our native land

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:30.466
Roman candles in each hand

01:14:30.508 --> 01:14:33.176
While a Yankee Doodle band

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:35.762
Gets hotter than a firecracker

01:14:35.763 --> 01:14:38.390
Don't need any long speeches

01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:40.642
Or shouts of "Hooray!"

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:45.944
No words can say as much
as firecrackers can say

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:56.241
Freedom! Freedom!

01:14:56.242 --> 01:15:00.829
Here comes the Freedom Man

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.581
On this day of independence

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:06.042
On this Independence Day

01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:11.715
Listen to an American
troubadour from the U. S.A.

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:16.761
I'm singing a song of freedom

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:22.814
For all people who cry out to be free

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.354
Free to sail the seven seas

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:29.232
Free to worship as we please

01:15:29.233 --> 01:15:31.359
If the birds up in the trees

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.610
Can be free

01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:34.988
Why can't we?

01:15:34.989 --> 01:15:40.326
I'm bringing a song of freedom

01:15:40.327 --> 01:15:46.332
To all people wherever they may be

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:49.377
Free to speak and free to hear

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:52.338
Free from want and free from fear

01:15:52.339 --> 01:15:54.549
Sons of freedom far and near

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:55.759
Who agree

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.719
Sing with me

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:03.725
That all God's people shall be free

01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:09.022
I'm singing a song of freedom

01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:15.320
For all people who cry out to be free

01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:18.490
Free to sail the seven seas

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:21.159
Free to worship as we please

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.411
If the birds up in the trees

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:24.496
Can be free

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:26.498
Why can't we?

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:31.753
I'm bringing a song of freedom

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:36.976
To all people wherever they may be

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:40.595
Free to speak and free to hear

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:43.306
Free from want and free from fear

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:45.809
Sons of freedom far and near

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:46.935
Who agree

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:48.603
Sing with me

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:52.273
That all God's people shall be free

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:56.369
That all God's people shall be free

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:10.917
Will you give me a lift?

01:17:10.918 --> 01:17:12.920
Sure, hop in.

01:17:19.844 --> 01:17:22.847
Aren't you Ted Hanover's
former dancing partner?

01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:27.559
Yes, although I wouldn't
exactly say former.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.812
I'm dancing with him
at the inn tonight.

01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:34.274
But I... Doesn't he
have a new partner?

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:36.151
Oh, she won't be there tonight.

01:17:36.152 --> 01:17:38.404
I didn't know that!

01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:40.321
I work at the inn.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:41.948
Oh?

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.242
Waitress?

01:17:44.243 --> 01:17:46.120
Yes.

01:17:46.871 --> 01:17:51.126
I know your boss, Jim Hardy,
quite well. Quite well.

01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:54.961
Then he's responsible for
your rejoining Mr. Hanover.

01:17:54.962 --> 01:17:56.379
Uh-huh.

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.548
By the way, if I were you,
I'd look my prettiest tonight

01:17:58.549 --> 01:17:59.841
when I'm waiting on tables.

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:01.593
Jim says there will be a
couple of men from Hollywood

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:03.596
to consider Ted and me for pictures.

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:06.264
And Mr. Hanover's other partner

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:08.558
will be missing this chance
to go to Hollywood.

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:10.602
Yes, although she can't
be very talented

01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:12.645
or they wouldn't be
working at the inn.

01:18:12.646 --> 01:18:15.524
Ted and I played
only the best places.

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.236
Listen, you're late
for the show already,

01:18:20.237 --> 01:18:21.613
if you'd care to let me drive

01:18:21.614 --> 01:18:25.084
I know a shortcut that'll get
us there 15 minutes sooner.

01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:32.081
There's a farmhouse near here

01:18:32.082 --> 01:18:33.583
and I'll have us towed out
in a couple of minutes.

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:34.918
Oh, for the love of mud, hurry!

01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:36.377
Wait right here!

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:38.255
What else can I do?

01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:47.722
- You're on now.
- But Linda isn't here yet.

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:49.015
You've got to save the pieces,

01:18:49.016 --> 01:18:50.141
keep those men interested now

01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:51.309
and do a number with Linda later.

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:52.435
What can I do?

01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:54.395
Well, fake something.

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:56.773
Fake something, okay.

01:19:02.613 --> 01:19:04.113
There's your cue.

01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:06.282
Don't fail me, keep them flying.

01:19:06.283 --> 01:19:08.080
I'll keep them flying.

01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:20.518
Linda! What happened to you?

01:22:20.519 --> 01:22:22.316
A bad job of sabotage.

01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:26.070
Excuse me!

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:30.903
Well, Jim, you deliberately kept me

01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:32.905
from working at the inn
tonight, didn't you?

01:22:32.906 --> 01:22:34.574
- Yeah.
- You knew there would be men here

01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:37.326
from Hollywood who might
offer me a chance in pictures.

01:22:37.327 --> 01:22:39.704
You've decided I shouldn't
have that opportunity.

01:22:39.705 --> 01:22:42.165
Not even the opportunity to refuse.

01:22:42.166 --> 01:22:43.791
I was afraid the offer might

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:45.918
be too important for
you to turn down.

01:22:45.919 --> 01:22:48.379
The point is you don't trust
me to make my own decisions

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:51.340
because they might interfere
with your own selfish plans.

01:22:51.341 --> 01:22:54.427
I've had about enough of that, Jim.

01:22:54.428 --> 01:22:56.429
Ted, Linda!

01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:58.347
Mr. Parker, Mr. Dunbar,

01:22:58.348 --> 01:22:59.557
I want you to meet the
greatest dance team

01:22:59.558 --> 01:23:01.434
in show business, Hanover and Mason.

01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:03.060
And the owner Jim Hardy.

01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:05.480
Glad to know you, Hardy.
Nice little place you've got here.

01:23:05.481 --> 01:23:06.731
Gentlemen, even though
you haven't seen

01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:08.524
Miss Mason dance, I can assure you...

01:23:08.525 --> 01:23:10.151
Hardy, Hollywood is always interested

01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:12.361
in new ideas and we
think this is a honey.

01:23:12.362 --> 01:23:14.864
Frankly, we'd like to do a picture
based on the Holiday Inn.

01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:17.825
The idea behind it, how it works,
the special holiday songs.

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:20.161
Of course, it's purely a speculative
thing, far from foolproof

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:21.954
and we can't afford to pay too much.

01:23:21.955 --> 01:23:23.664
You don't have to
start talking it down

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:25.750
because the idea is not for sale.

01:23:25.751 --> 01:23:27.335
Well, maybe I haven't
explained enough.

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:30.713
We expect to use Mr. Hanover
and his partner in the picture.

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:32.548
Well, I don't know
how the others feel

01:23:32.549 --> 01:23:35.259
but I'd like to keep this little
setup just the way it is.

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.594
Jim, would you be decent just once

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:38.638
and let somebody else
around here have a chance?

01:23:38.639 --> 01:23:40.348
Wait a minute, Danny, after
all, the place belongs to him

01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:42.225
he can do as he wants.

01:23:42.226 --> 01:23:44.810
I guess it was just
too good to last, huh?

01:23:44.811 --> 01:23:46.771
A simple little layout,
where we could do our best

01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:50.116
at the work we know without
having any illusions of glory.

01:23:51.068 --> 01:23:54.487
I can see now that I'm the only
one who could be happy here.

01:23:54.488 --> 01:23:56.322
Go ahead, take the idea,
take the music,

01:23:56.323 --> 01:23:58.115
take Linda, take the
whole darn thing.

01:23:58.116 --> 01:23:59.450
But what about you? We'll need you

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:01.327
in Hollywood to write
the rest of the music.

01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:03.287
Oh, no, I work right here.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:05.373
I'll send you the music
when it's written.

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:08.297
And don't bother me before, huh?

01:24:10.212 --> 01:24:12.463
Guess maybe I was
a little selfish, huh?

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:15.217
Is that the deal you wanted or
should I have thrown in my shirt?

01:24:18.595 --> 01:24:20.263
Chummy sort of a fellow, isn't he?

01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:23.766
Listen, Linda, if you
really want to stay here...

01:24:23.767 --> 01:24:27.186
Don't talk that way. This is the
chance you wanted, isn't it?

01:24:27.187 --> 01:24:30.941
Of course. Boy, are we happy!

01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:10.933
Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Jim.

01:27:10.934 --> 01:27:13.686
Same to you, Mamie. And staff.

01:27:13.687 --> 01:27:16.272
Didn't I tell you children
to stay in the kitchen?

01:27:16.273 --> 01:27:19.697
Those wings ain't going
to fly away. Now shoo!

01:27:21.361 --> 01:27:23.362
Everything's ready and hot, Mr. Jim.

01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:25.160
Thank you, Mamie.

01:27:45.051 --> 01:27:49.138
I've got plenty to be thankful for

01:27:49.139 --> 01:27:50.723
Are you kidding?

01:27:50.724 --> 01:27:54.226
I haven't got a great big yacht

01:27:54.227 --> 01:27:57.354
To sail from shore to shore

01:27:57.355 --> 01:28:01.484
Still I've got plenty
to be thankful for

01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:03.319
You're loaded, Dan.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:07.531
I've got plenty to be thankful for

01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:08.866
Like what?

01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:10.576
No private car

01:28:10.577 --> 01:28:11.869
No caviar

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:15.374
No carpet on my floor

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:19.794
Still I've got plenty
to be thankful for

01:28:19.795 --> 01:28:21.295
You know you're better off than I am.

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.506
I've got eyes to see with

01:28:23.507 --> 01:28:24.715
You need glasses.

01:28:24.716 --> 01:28:26.509
Ears to hear with

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:27.676
Or fly with.

01:28:27.677 --> 01:28:29.053
Arms to hug with

01:28:29.054 --> 01:28:30.638
Lips to kiss with

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:32.681
Someone to adore

01:28:32.682 --> 01:28:33.849
You're a little flat, too.

01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:39.104
How could anybody ask for more?

01:28:39.105 --> 01:28:42.107
My needs are small I buy them all

01:28:42.108 --> 01:28:45.486
At the five and ten cent store

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:46.695
Sing it!

01:28:46.696 --> 01:28:47.863
Sing it pretty.

01:28:47.864 --> 01:28:50.617
Oh, I've got plenty
to be thankful for

01:28:55.247 --> 01:28:57.499
Why, you ain't ate a bite.

01:28:58.416 --> 01:29:00.000
I'm pouting, Mamie.

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.126
Who is this?

01:29:01.127 --> 01:29:02.586
That's Mr. Jones.

01:29:02.587 --> 01:29:05.714
Jonesey! I'm sorry,
I knew him too well.

01:29:05.715 --> 01:29:07.508
But you got to eat.

01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:11.262
The trouble ain't with that
turkey, Mr. Jim, it's you!

01:29:11.263 --> 01:29:14.139
I feel all right.
I'm riding high, Mamie.

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:16.433
Well, why you close
the inn and sit around

01:29:16.434 --> 01:29:18.477
like a jellyfish with the misery?

01:29:18.478 --> 01:29:20.646
'Cause a slicker stole your gal

01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:23.741
and you ain't got fight
enough to get her back.

01:29:25.402 --> 01:29:26.777
Excuse me, Mr. Jim.

01:29:26.778 --> 01:29:28.612
I tried to keep her here!

01:29:28.613 --> 01:29:30.573
What kind of keeping is that?

01:29:30.574 --> 01:29:33.701
Nothing but tricks.
If you went to Hollywood

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:35.953
and told Miss Linda how
much you loves her,

01:29:35.954 --> 01:29:38.289
and misses her, and told her that

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:40.875
the way a lady likes to hear it told,

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:46.505
I'll bet you she'd be the quickest
ex-movie star that ever exed.

01:29:46.506 --> 01:29:48.257
You're crazy, Mamie

01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:52.720
I'm crazy? I knows Miss Linda.

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:56.181
I knows her like I knows my own kids.

01:29:56.182 --> 01:29:59.643
Why, she ain't the fancy
type no more than you are.

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:03.355
What she wants is what
you got right here.

01:30:03.356 --> 01:30:07.443
But women has to have them
things told to them the right way.

01:30:07.444 --> 01:30:10.738
You could melt her heart
right down to butter,

01:30:10.739 --> 01:30:14.033
if you'd only turn on the heat.

01:30:14.034 --> 01:30:16.994
Mamie, you don't try
to take a fellow's gal

01:30:16.995 --> 01:30:19.668
away from him after
he's bought the ring.

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:23.167
Or as I recall, do you?

01:30:23.168 --> 01:30:25.419
Now you're talking!

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:28.380
Oh, sure, women has to be
told things the right way.

01:30:28.381 --> 01:30:30.053
Yes, sir!

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:46.565
At last, the night I've been
dreaming about actually here.

01:30:46.566 --> 01:30:48.067
This is still my wedding, you know.

01:30:48.068 --> 01:30:49.526
You make me feel like a kibitzer.

01:30:49.527 --> 01:30:52.529
Now don't misunderstand me,
I'm happy because this marriage means

01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:55.115
that we can all settle
down and stop worrying.

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:57.701
I wish I had your confidence
without your viewpoint.

01:30:57.702 --> 01:30:59.620
My fingers are crossed
until Linda and I

01:30:59.621 --> 01:31:01.205
are on that plane bound for Yuma.

01:31:01.206 --> 01:31:02.873
Now what's worrying you?

01:31:02.874 --> 01:31:05.084
I don't know, except I've been
this close to marriage before

01:31:05.085 --> 01:31:06.377
only to wake up next morning

01:31:06.378 --> 01:31:08.462
and find myself with no
bride and a hangover.

01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:10.965
Look, the girl said yes,
the picture finishes tonight,

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:13.050
there's a judge waiting in Yuma.

01:31:13.051 --> 01:31:14.176
Come in!

01:31:14.177 --> 01:31:15.636
Everything is all set and ready.

01:31:15.637 --> 01:31:18.639
What could possibly happen to...

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:20.813
Hi, fellows!

01:31:23.353 --> 01:31:26.188
Jim, what brought you here?

01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:28.362
Train. Chug chug chug chug.

01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:30.442
The wedding, when is it?

01:31:30.443 --> 01:31:32.695
- Wedding?
- Yeah.

01:31:32.696 --> 01:31:34.947
Well, we hadn't set any exact time.

01:31:34.948 --> 01:31:36.407
Have you seen Linda?

01:31:36.408 --> 01:31:38.867
No, no, not yet. But, say,
I saw your director,

01:31:38.868 --> 01:31:40.995
he told me he was shooting
the finale tonight,

01:31:40.996 --> 01:31:43.123
thought I'd like to see
how you make pictures.

01:31:43.581 --> 01:31:46.083
He wouldn't... You wouldn't
like what they're doing tonight.

01:31:46.084 --> 01:31:47.251
Why not?

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:48.836
Oh, no, that's dull, technical stuff.

01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:51.130
Well, I'm a dull,
technical sort of a fellow.

01:31:51.131 --> 01:31:53.716
Perhaps if you'd wait
and see Linda tomorrow.

01:31:53.717 --> 01:31:56.719
Oh, no, I want to see the finish.

01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:00.222
The success of you and Linda
means a lot to me, pal.

01:32:00.223 --> 01:32:02.976
Say, why don't you be yourself.
What are you up to?

01:32:04.144 --> 01:32:07.479
Well, I'm a son of a gun.
This is a beautiful hunk of welcome

01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:08.981
for a guy who comes coast to coast

01:32:08.982 --> 01:32:11.984
just to wish you a merry
Christmas and a happy wedding.

01:32:13.278 --> 01:32:14.820
You remember how I suspected you

01:32:14.821 --> 01:32:17.415
when you came to live at
the inn on Easter morning?

01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:19.033
Silly, wasn't it?

01:32:19.034 --> 01:32:20.242
Now I know he's up to something.

01:32:20.243 --> 01:32:21.660
Oh, wait a minute
now let's not be unfair.

01:32:21.661 --> 01:32:22.745
No?

01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:25.330
No, we're treating Jim
like a poor country cousin.

01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:26.790
- He doesn't mean any harm!
- No!

01:32:26.791 --> 01:32:28.625
No, he just wants to see Linda.

01:32:28.626 --> 01:32:31.045
So let's show him Linda.

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:32.921
Goodwill on earth toward men.

01:32:32.922 --> 01:32:35.516
This... Where we going? What's this?

01:32:36.843 --> 01:32:39.219
Hey, Ted! What is this?

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.929
I was afraid you'd gone crazy.

01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:45.105
I'll keep him in here till
you get Linda on that plane.

01:32:46.644 --> 01:32:48.062
I better hurry and get my clothes on.

01:32:48.063 --> 01:32:49.563
Yeah, in the meantime
I'll go down to the set

01:32:49.564 --> 01:32:51.023
and see how near ready they are.

01:32:51.024 --> 01:32:52.816
Wait a minute,
my clothes are in there.

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:54.526
Merry Christmas!

01:32:54.527 --> 01:32:56.445
Jim, pal! Wait!

01:32:56.446 --> 01:32:58.744
Stop! We were only fooling!

01:32:59.866 --> 01:33:03.336
Only you could think
of a thing like that.

01:33:09.042 --> 01:33:11.001
Who you calling?

01:33:11.002 --> 01:33:13.971
Nobody, the operator's gone.

01:33:45.161 --> 01:33:48.289
Take it easy. Don't break your neck.

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:56.672
It's one of the most authentic
reproduction jobs we've ever done.

01:33:56.673 --> 01:33:57.881
Is it?

01:33:57.882 --> 01:33:59.299
And all worked out
from those photographs

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.884
we took of your place in Connecticut.

01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:02.887
Uh-huh.

01:34:04.097 --> 01:34:07.396
Well, Mamie and the kids ought to
see this. They'd never believe it!

01:34:07.767 --> 01:34:09.309
Anything wrong?

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:12.020
Well, that Christmas tree's
a little out of place.

01:34:12.021 --> 01:34:15.649
I'd guess nobody would
notice that but me or Linda.

01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:17.484
We're going to start rolling
in a couple of minutes.

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:18.902
Come along with me where
you can see everything.

01:34:18.903 --> 01:34:20.445
No, I'll just sort of
stay in the background.

01:34:20.446 --> 01:34:21.947
I don't want to get in your way.

01:34:21.948 --> 01:34:23.657
Well, suit yourself.
I'll see you later.

01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:25.455
Right.

01:34:44.804 --> 01:34:46.263
All right, darling,
we're going to follow you

01:34:46.264 --> 01:34:48.098
on the boom from here inside the inn.

01:34:48.099 --> 01:34:50.726
And when you get in the
other set, do your song.

01:34:50.727 --> 01:34:52.603
Let's see, I think you have the mood,

01:34:52.604 --> 01:34:54.479
your Hollywood success was empty,

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:58.154
you've lost the one man you love.
You know, the usual hope.

01:34:58.735 --> 01:35:01.528
Just make me cry and you
can get to that wedding.

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:02.863
All ready for rehearsal!

01:35:02.864 --> 01:35:04.907
Please! Let's shoot it.

01:35:04.908 --> 01:35:07.706
Okay, it's a take!

01:35:10.788 --> 01:35:14.291
All right, everybody,
quiet on the stage, it's a take.

01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:17.252
Close them up. Come on, over there,

01:35:17.253 --> 01:35:20.006
quiet down, let's get
settled, everybody.

01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:26.178
Come on, everybody, let's get
settled now. This is the picture.

01:35:28.097 --> 01:35:29.689
Hit the snow!

01:35:31.809 --> 01:35:33.606
All right, roll 'em!

01:35:39.609 --> 01:35:41.652
Sorry, Mr. Hanover,
but when the red light's on

01:35:41.653 --> 01:35:43.779
you couldn't get in even
if you owned the studio.

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:45.155
Oh, but, pop, this is important.

01:35:45.156 --> 01:35:46.490
I know, so is the light.

01:35:46.491 --> 01:35:48.709
Hit the playback. Music!

01:35:52.622 --> 01:35:54.749
All right, action!

01:37:14.579 --> 01:37:21.803
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

01:37:22.879 --> 01:37:27.850
Just like the ones I used to know

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:34.557
Where the treetops glisten

01:37:34.599 --> 01:37:38.894
And children listen

01:37:38.895 --> 01:37:45.323
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

01:37:50.531 --> 01:37:53.625
...dreaming of a white

01:37:54.577 --> 01:37:56.286
Christmas

01:37:57.372 --> 01:38:02.878
With every Christmas card I write

01:38:05.296 --> 01:38:11.678
May your days be merry and bright

01:38:14.597 --> 01:38:16.394
Jim!

01:38:16.974 --> 01:38:18.566
Cut it! Cut it!

01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:20.353
That's it!

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:22.608
All right, gentlemen!

01:38:27.276 --> 01:38:29.653
How could he get that
far in five minutes?

01:38:29.654 --> 01:38:31.863
The lady must have been willing.

01:38:31.864 --> 01:38:34.742
But the world can't do this to us.

01:38:51.801 --> 01:38:54.302
Here she comes down the street

01:38:54.303 --> 01:38:56.680
I'll admit my defeat

01:38:56.681 --> 01:38:59.433
I've won my hot toddy

01:38:59.434 --> 01:39:01.685
Over my scarred body

01:39:01.686 --> 01:39:08.233
I knew that I'd win singing

01:39:08.234 --> 01:39:12.113
But wait until she gets
a load of your dancing

01:39:12.989 --> 01:39:19.087
We'll stay at the inn singing

01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:23.170
All by myself I'll have
to stick to my dancing

01:39:26.169 --> 01:39:28.753
Oh, no, my friend, I'm here to end

01:39:28.754 --> 01:39:31.298
Your dancing trouble and strife

01:39:31.299 --> 01:39:34.050
This will be fun, Miss Hit-and-Run

01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:36.803
Has come back into my life

01:39:36.804 --> 01:39:38.722
We'll stay at the inn...

01:39:38.723 --> 01:39:40.515
We'll have to begin...

01:39:40.516 --> 01:39:41.766
Singing!

01:39:41.767 --> 01:39:43.985
Dancing!

01:39:52.278 --> 01:39:54.946
We've each other to cling to

01:39:54.947 --> 01:39:56.948
You'll be easy to sing to

01:39:56.949 --> 01:40:01.703
And you're easy to dance with

01:40:01.704 --> 01:40:07.542
So let the old year die
with a fond good-bye

01:40:07.543 --> 01:40:12.924
And our hopes as high as a kite

01:40:14.133 --> 01:40:17.928
How can our love go wrong

01:40:17.929 --> 01:40:25.358
If we start the new year right?
