and I'm always
gonna be your father.

55:37.416 --> 55:38.333
Listen to this.

55:39.125 --> 55:41.750
Stay away from me,
and stay away from her.

55:42.416 --> 55:43.833
Ain't gonna say
that shit again.

55:46.333 --> 55:49.291
I ain't gonna say it again.
Watch your fucking tone with me!

55:51.125 --> 55:53.958
Put your hands on Ma...
one more time,

55:54.625 --> 55:56.750
and I swear to God
I'll murder you myself.

55:58.333 --> 55:59.458
I <i>promise </i>you that.

56:02.791 --> 56:04.458
You can't talk
to your father that way.

56:08.416 --> 56:09.583
Don't get it twisted.

56:10.666 --> 56:12.000
You might have given me life,

56:12.958 --> 56:14.791
but you were never
my fuckin' father.
