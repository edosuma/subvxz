WEBVTT

00:14.134 --> 00:15.451
DREW:
Hey, Ryan!

00:15.502 --> 00:18.083
Hey! Where you been, man?

00:18.203 --> 00:20.006
Uh, j-just went for a run.

00:20.090 --> 00:22.175
No, I mean, like, in life.

00:22.259 --> 00:25.478
Seems like we haven't seen
your cool ass in, like, forever.

00:25.563 --> 00:27.480
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were avoiding us.

00:27.565 --> 00:28.731
Well, I...

00:28.799 --> 00:30.316
Hey! Hey!

00:30.401 --> 00:32.351
I thought I told you
to stay off my property.

00:32.436 --> 00:34.270
You've got a smart mouth and a bad attitude.
(cooing)

00:34.321 --> 00:35.905
I know your mother!

00:35.973 --> 00:38.107
Yeah, that's right,
walk away, bitch.

00:38.158 --> 00:39.308
I just, uh...

00:39.360 --> 00:41.244
I'm just yanking
your junk, man.

00:41.311 --> 00:43.246
I know you've been busy.

00:43.313 --> 00:45.531
I know what you're thinking.

00:45.616 --> 00:47.867
But we haven't bought
anything yet.

00:47.952 --> 00:49.085
We're just getting an estimate.

00:49.152 --> 00:50.870
On the, uh...

00:50.955 --> 00:52.488
home security system.

00:52.539 --> 00:54.173
Oh, right.
Yeah.

00:54.258 --> 00:57.377
Jenna heard about a couple of
recent break-ins in Venice.

00:57.461 --> 00:59.212
And she's super nervous
about it,

00:59.296 --> 01:01.598
even though they're not really
that close to our neighborhood.

01:01.665 --> 01:03.182
I think she's overreacting.

01:03.267 --> 01:05.301
I mean, this thing
could set us back

01:05.352 --> 01:07.103
at least a couple of G's.

01:07.170 --> 01:08.838
Wow.
Hey.

01:08.889 --> 01:11.224
You wouldn't mind
talking to her, would you?

01:11.308 --> 01:13.026
I mean, just-just, you know,

01:13.110 --> 01:14.777
letting her know
the neighborhood's safe and all.

01:14.845 --> 01:16.345
Aw, well, I-I don't know

01:16.397 --> 01:18.031
what I could say that
you haven't already said.

01:18.115 --> 01:20.316
No, it'd mean more
coming from you.

01:20.367 --> 01:21.985
I mean, she thinks I'm only
against the security system

01:22.036 --> 01:23.019
'cause I'm a cheapskate.

01:23.070 --> 01:26.039
Uh, okay, I guess if I,

01:26.123 --> 01:28.043
if I run into her, then
I'll try and bring it up.

01:28.125 --> 01:30.326
Ah, thanks, brochacho.
(laughs)

01:30.377 --> 01:31.527
I'll see you later, man.

01:31.578 --> 01:34.330
Yeah, now where you gonna go,

01:34.381 --> 01:36.299
you little AIDS of the sky?

01:36.366 --> 01:37.867
(pigeon cooing)

01:37.918 --> 01:40.036
What... wh-what are...
what are you doing?

01:40.087 --> 01:42.338
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ease up, chief!

01:42.389 --> 01:43.673
I don't want no trouble!

01:43.724 --> 01:45.374
(screams) It touched me!
It touched me!

01:45.426 --> 01:47.010
It almost touched me.

01:47.061 --> 01:48.928
(dogs barking)

01:52.983 --> 01:54.901
WILFRED:
I've got to toughen up.

01:54.985 --> 01:59.405
I couldn't even intimidate
that loitering wise-ass.

01:59.490 --> 02:00.723
You know, I spoke
to his mother, by the way.

02:00.774 --> 02:02.442
You know what she said to me?

02:02.526 --> 02:05.194
"Why don't you find a real crime
to solve, McGruff?"

02:05.245 --> 02:07.196
And you wonder
where he gets it from.

02:07.247 --> 02:08.497
Well, you don't have to worry

02:08.565 --> 02:09.925
about protecting
your yard anymore.

02:09.949 --> 02:11.117
Apparently,
Jenna's thinking about

02:11.201 --> 02:13.086
installing
a home security system.

02:13.170 --> 02:14.203
Bite your tongue!

02:14.254 --> 02:15.922
A home security system to a dog

02:16.006 --> 02:17.623
is like the cotton gin
to a slave.

02:17.708 --> 02:18.925
It's an insult.

02:19.009 --> 02:21.210
It says you're
easily replaceable.

02:21.261 --> 02:23.129
You know why they call us
"watch dogs," Ryan?

02:23.213 --> 02:24.914
I have no idea.

02:24.965 --> 02:26.466
No one does.

02:26.550 --> 02:28.801
Point is, it's the duty
of the household dog

02:28.886 --> 02:30.770
to heroically protect
the property.

02:30.854 --> 02:31.921
I don't get
what the big deal is.

02:31.972 --> 02:34.057
You know Howard
from down the street?

02:34.108 --> 02:37.093
He got replaced
by a home security system.

02:37.144 --> 02:38.811
Guess what they call him now.

02:38.896 --> 02:40.730
Howard the Dickhead.

02:40.781 --> 02:42.815
That's because
they think he's a coward.

02:44.151 --> 02:45.902
Please, Ryan.

02:45.953 --> 02:48.037
You've got to convince Jenna
that she's overthinking

02:48.105 --> 02:50.073
all this security stuff.
Um...

02:50.124 --> 02:52.492
in case you forgot, I sort
of had feelings for her.

02:52.576 --> 02:55.044
Look, I-I thought we agreed
that it was better for everyone,

02:55.112 --> 02:57.113
especially Jenna,
if I stayed away.

02:57.164 --> 02:58.297
It's different this time.

02:58.382 --> 02:59.549
Jenna really needs
your help, mate.

02:59.616 --> 03:01.000
No, you need my help.

03:01.085 --> 03:02.802
You just don't want
to look like a pussy

03:02.886 --> 03:04.387
in front of the
neighborhood dogs.

03:04.454 --> 03:06.506
Fine.

03:06.590 --> 03:08.958
I'll handle this myself.

03:09.009 --> 03:10.259
What are you gonna do?

03:10.310 --> 03:11.511
Like I said,

03:11.595 --> 03:13.462
if I want to be
a real hero dog,

03:13.514 --> 03:15.014
then it's time to man up.

03:15.099 --> 03:16.766
And I'm gonna do
that through training,

03:16.817 --> 03:19.018
discipline
and searching "hero dog"

03:19.103 --> 03:20.853
to see what that even means.

03:20.938 --> 03:22.939
Ah, check it out.

03:22.990 --> 03:26.809
This stud-muffin called 911
when his owner fainted.

03:26.860 --> 03:28.694
Whoa! A cop dog.

03:28.779 --> 03:30.997
Apprehended a mugging suspect.

03:31.081 --> 03:33.149
Dragged a five-year-old kid
out of a house fire.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.535
And then a year later,

03:35.619 --> 03:38.454
saved his partner from
a boring cocaine-free weekend

03:38.505 --> 03:40.990
by helping him seize two kilos
of that good raw.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.508
Whew. Damn.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:52.002 --> 03:54.387
Well, well, well.

03:54.471 --> 03:57.006
I see you're creeping out
the back like a little vag

03:57.057 --> 04:00.943
to-- let me guess--
avoid Jenna?

04:01.011 --> 04:04.614
And I see you're literally
tiptoeing into the back alley

04:04.681 --> 04:06.849
to-- let me guess-- avoid
the pigeon in the front yard?

04:06.900 --> 04:08.785
(laughs) Pigeon?

04:08.852 --> 04:10.486
There's three of them now.

04:10.537 --> 04:12.617
And they're all strutting
around, bobbing their heads

04:12.623 --> 04:14.490
to that black rapper music
playing on their headphones.

04:14.541 --> 04:16.075
(pigeons cooing nearby)

04:16.160 --> 04:18.077
(whispers):
Shit, let's get out of here.

04:21.048 --> 04:22.748
You got to admit,
all this sneaking around,

04:22.833 --> 04:24.333
this is no way to live.

04:24.384 --> 04:25.802
I'm just trying to
keep my distance.

04:25.869 --> 04:26.829
I'm not sneaking around.

04:26.870 --> 04:27.804
Well, I am.

04:27.871 --> 04:29.555
And it's been hell.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.175
Been so nervous, I haven't
shit since yesterday morning.

04:32.226 --> 04:33.709
Wilfred, you need to shit.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.511
I'm fine.

04:35.562 --> 04:37.480
Seriously. Just try.

04:37.547 --> 04:39.732
(sighs)

04:52.746 --> 04:54.747
Ah, this could take awhile.

04:54.832 --> 04:57.116
Would you mind grabbing us
something to read?

04:57.201 --> 05:00.119
Like, uh, perhaps, uh,
that impressive flyer

05:00.204 --> 05:04.040
that looks like someone spent
a lot of time working on.

05:04.091 --> 05:05.174
(sighs)

05:09.379 --> 05:10.346
"Neighborhood watch"?

05:10.413 --> 05:13.182
What the hell?

05:13.250 --> 05:14.550
This says I organized it!

05:14.601 --> 05:15.584
Whoa!

05:15.636 --> 05:17.386
That is weird.

05:17.437 --> 05:18.754
You did this.

05:18.805 --> 05:21.057
This is just a stupid excuse
to show how

05:21.108 --> 05:23.092
brave and heroic
you are to the other dogs.

05:23.143 --> 05:25.394
God, now all these people
are gonna

05:25.445 --> 05:27.396
show up at my house.

05:27.447 --> 05:29.148
Right now?

05:30.784 --> 05:32.818
You must be Ryan.

05:32.903 --> 05:35.271
Yeah, um, I'm guessing
you're here

05:35.322 --> 05:36.923
for the neighborhood watch meeting?
Yeah.

05:36.940 --> 05:38.580
I got to say, I'm-I'm
thrilled about this.

05:38.608 --> 05:39.942
'Cause, uh, my bike got
swiped a couple weeks ago,

05:39.993 --> 05:41.610
and it's, like, I'm feeling

05:41.662 --> 05:42.745
like I'm not gonna take
this crap anymore.

05:42.796 --> 05:44.163
Right on, man.

05:44.248 --> 05:46.082
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

05:46.133 --> 05:47.500
Because I can't say things
'cause I'm a dog.

05:47.584 --> 05:49.635
Uh-huh.
Well, look, the thing is...

05:49.720 --> 05:52.255
JENNA:
Sorry I'm late!

05:52.306 --> 05:53.867
Oh, my God, Ryan,
when I saw your flyer,

05:53.924 --> 05:55.808
I was like, this is perfect.

05:55.893 --> 05:57.560
I've been so worried
about the recent break-ins,

05:57.627 --> 05:58.761
and now we can actually

05:58.812 --> 06:00.229
do something about it.

06:00.297 --> 06:01.514
Hi, I'm Jenna.

06:01.598 --> 06:03.349
Alan.
Nice to meet you.

06:04.735 --> 06:06.736
I'm gonna go put these inside.

06:09.072 --> 06:10.823
Hey, listen, man, um,

06:10.908 --> 06:13.359
I don't think I can
participate in this anymore.

06:13.443 --> 06:15.745
Thing is, I've had a huge
hard-on for that Jenna chick,

06:15.812 --> 06:17.747
like, ever since she moved
up the block from me.

06:17.814 --> 06:19.582
And I just think the
idea of walking

06:19.649 --> 06:22.251
around the neighborhood
together, hanging out,

06:22.319 --> 06:23.986
sharing our thoughts,
making each other laugh,

06:24.037 --> 06:25.454
getting closer...

06:25.505 --> 06:27.757
it's just too much temptation.

06:27.824 --> 06:29.041
I mean, she's married, right?

06:30.344 --> 06:32.011
I'm sorry, man.

06:32.095 --> 06:33.179
I'm out.
I can't do it.

06:34.464 --> 06:36.332
JENNA:
You coming?

06:36.383 --> 06:38.601
What happened to Alan?

06:38.668 --> 06:40.519
Maybe this was a bad idea.

06:40.604 --> 06:43.339
You know, the-the turnout
wasn't exactly what I expected.

06:43.390 --> 06:45.341
I-I think we should
just call it off.

06:45.392 --> 06:46.692
What?

06:46.777 --> 06:48.978
No, this is a great idea, Ryan.

06:49.029 --> 06:50.730
Property crime in
Venice has increased

06:50.814 --> 06:52.898
by almost two percent
in the last six months.

06:52.983 --> 06:55.067
I mean, this is our chance to
take back the neighborhood.

06:55.152 --> 06:56.819
Just the two of us?

06:56.870 --> 06:58.671
If it's two determined
people like you and me,

06:58.688 --> 07:00.573
then, yeah, we can do it.

07:03.210 --> 07:04.293
Okay.
(laughs)

07:04.361 --> 07:05.294
I'm in.

07:05.362 --> 07:07.079
(grunts)

07:07.164 --> 07:08.798
Besides, it won't just
be the two of us.

07:08.865 --> 07:09.832
Wilfy'll help!

07:09.883 --> 07:11.200
Oh.
(pigeon cooing)

07:11.251 --> 07:12.701
(yells)

07:12.753 --> 07:13.869
Get on the ground!

07:13.920 --> 07:15.171
(Taser crackling)

07:15.222 --> 07:16.255
(Jenna laughs)

07:24.736 --> 07:25.852
Thanks a lot.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.854
Now I have to spend two hours

07:27.906 --> 07:29.373
a day with Jenna, one on one.

07:29.457 --> 07:30.908
It's all for a
good cause, Ryan.

07:31.425 --> 07:34.211
Bear?

07:34.296 --> 07:36.747
Would you please do me
the honor of pinning on

07:36.831 --> 07:38.882
my official canine
enforcement unit badge?

07:43.373 --> 07:45.806
Hey.

07:45.873 --> 07:48.058
Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

07:48.143 --> 07:50.811
Okay, we promised, no tears.

07:50.878 --> 07:52.833
Look, you knew what
you were getting into

07:52.953 --> 07:54.193
before you got
involved with me.

07:54.213 --> 07:55.213
I'm a cop.

07:55.281 --> 07:56.415
This is who I am.

07:56.466 --> 07:58.500
Danger is just a part...

07:58.584 --> 08:01.920
Wait, are you...
are you laughing?

08:01.971 --> 08:03.621
What do you mean
you smell pussy?

08:03.673 --> 08:04.890
Where?

08:04.957 --> 08:06.174
Oh. (chuckles)

08:06.259 --> 08:07.843
You know what?

08:07.927 --> 08:09.811
Call someone else
the next time you need help.

08:11.848 --> 08:13.631
(quietly): How do I
pin this thing on?

08:13.683 --> 08:14.816
Wilfred, don't.

08:14.901 --> 08:16.234
No, it's okay, Ryan.

08:16.302 --> 08:17.802
I've got this. Relax.

08:17.854 --> 08:20.155
(yells)

08:28.865 --> 08:31.500
(sobbing)

08:31.584 --> 08:33.751
Ryan?

08:33.818 --> 08:37.672
I think... I think
I made a mistake.

08:37.756 --> 08:39.457
It hurts.

08:39.509 --> 08:42.376
It... it hurts.

08:42.462 --> 08:43.495
It hurts.
I told you.

08:43.546 --> 08:45.797
This really hurts.

08:45.848 --> 08:48.350
All right, you mopes,
you know the routine.

08:48.434 --> 08:50.268
Up against the wall.

08:50.336 --> 08:54.005
Look, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

08:54.056 --> 08:55.023
You know what?

08:55.108 --> 08:56.148
Warning, warning, warning!

08:56.192 --> 08:57.609
You've all been issued warnings.

08:57.676 --> 08:59.394
I hope you're proud
of yourselves.

08:59.479 --> 09:01.113
It's actually good we're
doing this in the morning.

09:01.180 --> 09:02.397
I read that most
home invasions occur

09:02.482 --> 09:05.016
between the hours of
7:00 and 10:00 a.m.

09:05.067 --> 09:07.185
Huh.
I saw on the police blotter last night

09:07.236 --> 09:08.820
that someone's garage
was broken into

09:08.871 --> 09:10.906
less than a mile away from us.

09:10.990 --> 09:12.207
And Drew thinks
I'm being ridiculous

09:12.291 --> 09:14.075
for wanting a home
security system.

09:14.160 --> 09:17.662
RYAN: Well, it's not like you've
really needed one before, right?

09:17.713 --> 09:21.967
Listen, we were trying to keep
this quiet, but it's you, so...

09:22.034 --> 09:24.085
The reason I've
been so concerned

09:24.170 --> 09:26.204
about the neighborhood
lately is 'cause...

09:26.255 --> 09:28.423
well, if Drew and I are
gonna raise a family here,

09:28.508 --> 09:30.392
then I want to make
sure it's safe.

09:30.476 --> 09:31.977
You're pregnant?

09:32.044 --> 09:34.045
No, no. Not yet.

09:34.096 --> 09:36.598
But we just started trying.

09:36.682 --> 09:38.400
W-We've talked
about it a lot.

09:38.484 --> 09:39.884
What we went through last time

09:39.936 --> 09:42.354
when we thought I
was pregnant and...

09:42.405 --> 09:44.105
We're ready now.

09:44.190 --> 09:45.390
That's great.

09:45.441 --> 09:46.558
I'm excited for you.

09:46.609 --> 09:48.360
Thanks, Ryan.

09:48.411 --> 09:50.662
God, it feels so good
to finally share that.

09:50.729 --> 09:52.330
I feel like I barely
see you anymore.

09:52.398 --> 09:53.832
I've missed this.

09:53.899 --> 09:56.535
MARGOT:
Hey! Jenna, Ryan!

09:56.586 --> 09:57.502
JENNA:
Hey, Margot.

09:57.570 --> 09:59.254
Nice work.

09:59.338 --> 10:00.672
What?

10:00.739 --> 10:01.706
I said, "Nice work."

10:01.757 --> 10:03.341
In your garden.

10:03.409 --> 10:05.293
Wait, hang on, I'll come over.

10:05.378 --> 10:07.262
Classic Margot--
couldn't hear death

10:07.346 --> 10:08.930
if it was knocking on her door.

10:16.472 --> 10:17.689
(slow-motion):
Wilfred!

10:17.757 --> 10:19.391
No!

10:19.442 --> 10:21.092
Look out, bitch!

10:21.143 --> 10:23.144
(grunts)

10:29.819 --> 10:32.287
(country music playing in car)

10:37.109 --> 10:38.877
I admit, it's possible

10:38.944 --> 10:42.247
I may have misjudged the
situation by, like, 100%.

10:42.298 --> 10:43.665
I'll do better next time.

10:43.749 --> 10:45.617
There's not gonna be
a next time.

10:45.668 --> 10:47.118
You heard Jenna;
you're done.

10:47.169 --> 10:49.588
I'm off the force?

10:49.639 --> 10:52.841
I'm done, too, if it makes
you feel any better.

10:52.925 --> 10:55.227
I'm never gonna be
like that cop dog.

10:55.294 --> 10:57.846
I'm never gonna save
anyone from a house fire

10:57.930 --> 10:59.314
or provide my partner with

10:59.398 --> 11:01.566
a weekend-long
nose blizzard.

11:01.634 --> 11:04.436
I assume you'll want me
to turn in my badge.

11:04.487 --> 11:05.904
I really don't care.

11:05.971 --> 11:07.272
(yells)

11:07.323 --> 11:10.075
Goddamn it!

11:10.142 --> 11:11.142
Mm.

11:12.645 --> 11:14.479
(glass shatters in distance)

11:17.033 --> 11:18.700
(glass continues shattering)

11:27.927 --> 11:29.544
(clattering)

11:33.432 --> 11:35.667
(groans)

11:35.718 --> 11:36.885
Oh, shit! Ryan!

11:36.969 --> 11:38.687
What the hell are you doing?!

11:38.771 --> 11:40.055
Making a sammich.

11:41.274 --> 11:43.174
All right, fine.

11:43.225 --> 11:44.726
I was staging a burglary

11:44.810 --> 11:47.062
so I could call 911
and become a hero.

11:47.146 --> 11:49.614
Was punching me in the face
part of your plan?

11:49.682 --> 11:51.616
I'm sorry. I thought
you were a real burglar.

11:51.684 --> 11:53.735
You know, the way Jenna's
been going on and on

11:53.819 --> 11:55.019
about all the
recent break-ins.

11:56.205 --> 11:57.355
Whoa!

11:57.406 --> 11:59.157
(groans)
Ryan, are you okay?!

11:59.208 --> 12:01.209
(groans)

12:01.294 --> 12:04.296
Oh, my God.

12:04.363 --> 12:05.964
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

12:07.032 --> 12:08.500
(groans)

12:08.551 --> 12:10.468
You can do this.
Just concentrate.

12:10.536 --> 12:11.803
(breathing deeply)

12:11.870 --> 12:13.388
You're a hero dog.

12:19.211 --> 12:21.179
Okay, okay. 911.

12:21.230 --> 12:24.649
All you have to do
is press 911.

12:24.717 --> 12:26.184
Five...

12:26.235 --> 12:27.736
Shit!

12:27.820 --> 12:29.053
No, that's wrong!

12:29.105 --> 12:30.739
Five is not nine.

12:30.823 --> 12:32.774
Okay, starting over.

12:35.578 --> 12:38.863
9-9-9-9-9...

12:38.914 --> 12:40.498
9... pound sign.

12:40.566 --> 12:41.833
Damn it!

12:41.900 --> 12:44.252
JENNA:
Ryan? Hello?

12:44.337 --> 12:46.588
Jenna. Shit.

12:46.672 --> 12:49.341
If she sees me here,
she'll know I couldn't save you.

12:50.593 --> 12:53.128
Ryan? Ryan?

12:54.630 --> 12:56.748
What happened?!

12:56.799 --> 12:58.049
I-I fell.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.584
I heard a noise from my house,

12:59.635 --> 13:01.436
and then your door was open.

13:02.722 --> 13:05.273
Oh, my God, you've been robbed!

13:05.358 --> 13:06.891
You seem good
for the most part,

13:06.942 --> 13:08.777
but you could still could
have a minor concussion.

13:08.861 --> 13:11.196
Whoa!
What happened?

13:11.263 --> 13:14.616
I think we've got all we need,
Mr. Newman. We'll be in touch.

13:14.700 --> 13:16.618
Thanks, Officer.
Don't worry.

13:16.702 --> 13:19.022
In case it's a concussion,
I'm gonna stay with you tonight.

13:19.071 --> 13:21.740
Oh, Jenna,
that's-that's not necessary.

13:21.791 --> 13:23.408
Please. How awful
would I feel

13:23.459 --> 13:25.126
if, God forbid,
something happened?

13:25.211 --> 13:27.045
Plus, Drew's in Phoenix
for the night on business,

13:27.112 --> 13:29.748
so it's probably safer
if we stay together anyway.

13:29.799 --> 13:32.333
Come here, Wilfred!

13:32.418 --> 13:33.835
Yeah, I get it.

13:33.919 --> 13:35.887
You want me close by
for protection.

13:35.954 --> 13:37.555
Oh, look how scared Wilfred is.

13:37.623 --> 13:38.790
He's whimpering.

13:38.841 --> 13:40.642
I'm not whimpering.

13:40.726 --> 13:42.927
He probably senses that
something bad happened.

13:42.978 --> 13:44.813
Typical scaredy-cat Wilfy.

13:44.897 --> 13:46.598
Who are you calling
a goddamn scaredy-cat?!

13:46.649 --> 13:48.817
Aw, he's shaking.

13:48.901 --> 13:50.351
(laughs)

13:52.749 --> 13:54.869
I can't believe what's happening
to this neighborhood.

13:54.884 --> 13:57.503
I'm definitely installing
that security system now.

13:58.284 --> 14:00.118
I'm a complete failure.

14:00.202 --> 14:02.954
My father was right about me
when he looked me in the eye

14:03.038 --> 14:04.438
and said... (panting)

14:04.490 --> 14:06.440
Maybe we should
even get a panic room.

14:06.492 --> 14:08.660
I've looked into it,
and they're not that uncommon.

14:08.744 --> 14:10.628
Sure, some of them
are expensive,

14:10.713 --> 14:14.465
but you can't really put a price
on your family's safety, right?

14:14.550 --> 14:16.384
Jenna, you know, I'm
actually feeling better.

14:16.451 --> 14:17.886
Maybe you should

14:17.953 --> 14:20.171
just take Wilfred
and head home.

14:20.256 --> 14:21.956
I hate keeping you awake like this.
Ryan, it's nothing.

14:22.007 --> 14:24.142
And besides, what if
the burglars come back?

14:24.226 --> 14:25.844
You're in no shape
to protect yourself.

14:25.928 --> 14:28.346
I've been taking these
self-defense classes at Equinox,

14:28.430 --> 14:29.630
and I've gotten pretty good.

14:29.682 --> 14:31.202
There are these
certain pressure points

14:31.233 --> 14:33.568
on the side of your neck
and then just below the ears.

14:33.635 --> 14:35.770
And if you press on them...
Jenna, please!

14:35.821 --> 14:36.971
I don't need your protection.

14:37.022 --> 14:38.406
I'm fine, really.

14:38.473 --> 14:39.741
Are you sure? Because...

14:39.808 --> 14:41.192
Yes, I'm sure.

14:41.277 --> 14:42.476
I don't think
I have a concussion.

14:42.528 --> 14:43.945
I just want to get some sleep.

14:43.996 --> 14:46.281
Please, just go home.

14:46.332 --> 14:49.167
Oh, uh... okay.

14:51.203 --> 14:52.320
Dick.

14:57.326 --> 14:59.761
JENNA (over TV): A 2.4 magnitude
earthquake hit between El Segundo

14:59.828 --> 15:02.130
and Mar Vista at 10:00 a.m.
this morning.

15:02.181 --> 15:05.717
Rattled residents from Torrance
to this Venice neighborhood...

15:05.801 --> 15:06.667
(turns off TV)

15:18.731 --> 15:20.281
(sniffing)

15:25.354 --> 15:27.405
(man coughing)

15:31.410 --> 15:34.028
(coughing continues)

15:34.079 --> 15:35.630
What happened?

15:35.697 --> 15:37.165
Is everybody okay?

15:37.216 --> 15:39.584
We just woke up, and
there was all this smoke.

15:39.668 --> 15:40.885
Oh, my God!
Wilfred?

15:40.970 --> 15:43.421
Wilfred!
Wilfred!

15:44.590 --> 15:45.974
Wilfred!

15:46.041 --> 15:47.308
(coughing)

15:48.677 --> 15:51.379
(both coughing)

15:51.430 --> 15:53.214
(siren wailing in distance)

15:53.265 --> 15:56.884
Wilfred, what did you do?!

15:56.936 --> 15:58.569
Apparently nothing.

15:58.654 --> 16:01.889
I know you set that fire!

16:01.941 --> 16:03.157
It's true.

16:03.225 --> 16:04.558
(coughing)

16:04.610 --> 16:07.829
I wanted to save Jenna and Drew.

16:07.896 --> 16:10.114
I wanted to be a hero.

16:10.199 --> 16:12.533
But I couldn't even save myself.

16:12.584 --> 16:14.035
You're insane!

16:14.086 --> 16:16.788
All this to impress
the neighborhood dogs?

16:16.872 --> 16:18.506
It was never
about the dogs, Ryan.

16:18.573 --> 16:20.241
It was always for Jenna.

16:20.292 --> 16:22.343
What, so she wouldn't
get a security system?

16:22.411 --> 16:23.744
It was never about that either.

16:23.796 --> 16:24.846
I don't believe you!

16:24.913 --> 16:27.098
Maybe you haven't noticed, Ryan,

16:27.182 --> 16:29.050
but Jenna's in a bad
place right now.

16:29.101 --> 16:32.270
All this obsession with
neighborhood security,

16:32.354 --> 16:34.689
double-checking and
triple-checking the door locks,

16:34.756 --> 16:37.108
she can't even walk from her
car to the grocery store

16:37.192 --> 16:39.271
without clutching a can
of pepper spray.

16:42.097 --> 16:44.983
I thought I could make her
feel safe.

16:45.067 --> 16:48.453
You know what?

16:48.537 --> 16:50.371
Me, too.

16:50.439 --> 16:53.207
I thought I was protecting her
by staying away,

16:53.275 --> 16:56.794
but... I should've
been there for her.

16:58.780 --> 17:01.966
Oh, my God.

17:02.051 --> 17:04.469
Bear's still in there!

17:04.553 --> 17:07.555
Wilfred, no, no, no!
Bear will be fine!

17:07.622 --> 17:08.806
That's what I'm worried about!

17:08.891 --> 17:10.308
When I was inside,

17:10.392 --> 17:12.393
I didn't lock Bear
in the bedroom!

17:12.461 --> 17:14.729
If I don't go back in,
Bear will live!

17:14.796 --> 17:17.348
Bear, don't live!

17:17.433 --> 17:19.934
I can't go on without
you being dead!

17:19.984 --> 17:21.853
Somebody, please
don't save bear!

17:21.936 --> 17:24.021
(siren wailing)

17:27.613 --> 17:29.882
Okay, I'll see
you soon. Bye.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.418
Drew says Wilfred's
gonna be fine.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.819
They're leaving the vet now.

17:33.870 --> 17:36.505
Good.

17:36.590 --> 17:38.991
Ryan, what you did
for Wilfred...

17:39.042 --> 17:40.593
I can't thank you enough.

17:40.660 --> 17:41.994
Oh, it's nothing.

17:42.045 --> 17:43.762
It's the only thing
I could've done.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.349
I should get out of your hair.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.134
That Alan guy said

17:49.186 --> 17:52.170
I could stay at his place
until Drew got back, so...

17:52.222 --> 17:53.856
Jenna, stay.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.358
I'm-I'm really sorry
about the other night.

17:56.443 --> 18:00.646
No, it's okay.
I was being pushy.

18:00.697 --> 18:02.314
I've just been so worried

18:02.365 --> 18:03.949
about all this
neighborhood crime stuff.

18:04.017 --> 18:06.318
I mean, I don't want
to raise a child

18:06.369 --> 18:08.070
in an unsafe environment.

18:08.154 --> 18:10.239
Honestly, after all
this craziness,

18:10.323 --> 18:12.374
maybe we should just
put the baby stuff

18:12.459 --> 18:14.210
on hold for a while.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.912
Till the neighborhood's
safe enough?

18:16.997 --> 18:19.582
Or until we can afford to move
somewhere less dangerous.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.884
Jenna, do you think

18:21.968 --> 18:23.919
any neighborhood will
ever feel safe enough?

18:27.224 --> 18:29.091
Oh, my God.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.712
What's wrong with me?

18:36.549 --> 18:39.318
When I first heard
I was pregnant,

18:39.385 --> 18:41.353
I felt depressed.

18:41.404 --> 18:44.657
And then when it turned out
I wasn't, I felt relieved.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.826
And then ashamed because
I felt relieved.

18:47.894 --> 18:52.197
I-I always thought
I wanted to be like my mom:

18:52.249 --> 18:54.416
perfect husband, huge family.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.003
She was so disappointed

18:58.071 --> 18:59.705
when she heard
I wasn't pregnant.

18:59.756 --> 19:02.541
Well, when I was kid,

19:02.592 --> 19:05.911
my dad wanted me
to be a lawyer.

19:05.962 --> 19:08.747
Before I knew it,
I was going to law school

19:08.798 --> 19:10.799
and working at his firm.

19:10.884 --> 19:14.753
I was miserable,
and I finally snapped.

19:14.804 --> 19:17.756
And I went to
a really dark place.

19:17.807 --> 19:20.059
Happiness is hard to find.

19:20.110 --> 19:22.928
Real, true happiness.

19:22.979 --> 19:25.764
We got to try taking risks

19:25.815 --> 19:29.234
without second-guessing
yourself or worrying

19:29.286 --> 19:32.104
about the consequences.

19:32.155 --> 19:34.773
Otherwise, you'll never
really know.

19:50.640 --> 19:51.724
Uh...

19:53.727 --> 19:55.561
(door opens)

19:58.064 --> 19:59.898
(door closes)

20:15.999 --> 20:18.500
You okay?

20:18.585 --> 20:20.336
(whispers):
Yeah.
