-Did I?
-Yeah, you did.

02:10.520 --> 02:13.394

02:53.738 --> 02:54.783
Condoms.

Are there, uh, any particular
condoms you'’re looking for,

don'’t pay very well,

05:06.741 --> 05:09.265

leading anywhere.

-Come on, dude.
You know I can'’t.

-And you passed the test.

All right,
I stocked the coolers,
rotated expiration dates,

06:54.979 --> 06:58.026
and because you'’re late,
I even cleaned the bathroom.
I gotta get out of here.

07:06.077 --> 07:08.123
Whoa, whoa,

you'’re going out
with some chick?

07:12.127 --> 07:14.434
[chuckles] Yeah,
but you don'’t know her.

The ERC knows every pair
of tits in this town.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.572
And there aren'’t many
left to choose from.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.574
So please invite me.

you don'’t know her, man.

07:28.012 --> 07:29.361
Well, come on,
give me a name.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.539
Dena. Sound familiar?

07:32.582 --> 07:35.411
Dena? I know a Christina.
Nice ass.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.197
I know a Gina,

07:39.937 --> 07:42.200
I don'’t know a Dena. Is...

07:42.244 --> 07:43.811
-Is she hot?
-I don'’t know.

07:44.420 --> 07:45.595
You don'’t know?

07:46.640 --> 07:48.076
How the fuck do you not know?

07:49.207 --> 07:51.035
All right,
promise you won'’t laugh.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.343
I promise. I promise.

07:56.519 --> 07:57.999
I met her
on a singles'’ hotline.

07:58.956 --> 08:00.567
Define "singles'’ hotline."

08:00.610 --> 08:03.570
Singles'’ hotline. You know,
you call a 1800 number,

08:03.613 --> 08:06.224
and they hook you up
with "sexy singles"
in your neighborhood and--

08:06.268 --> 08:08.618
Phone hotline? [laughing]

08:11.229 --> 08:12.840
Are you fucking with me?

Whoo! [laughing]

08:16.713 --> 08:17.758
Hello!

08:22.153 --> 08:24.591
You didn'’t think a dating site
would be a better option?

08:24.634 --> 08:28.464
You got Christian sites,
porn sites, midget sites,
all sorts of sites.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.900
Anything with pictures, man.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.380
-You don'’t start--
-Dude.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.774
You always swept me
for being lame.

08:33.817 --> 08:36.558
Do nothing but sitting at home,
so tonight, I said, "Fuck it.

08:36.602 --> 08:38.474
I'’m taking Eric's advice."

08:38.518 --> 08:40.083
I'’m going for it,
just like you said.

08:43.784 --> 08:46.830
If the ERC inspired
tonight'’s journey,

08:47.788 --> 08:49.093
I will not hold you back.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.052
You have my blessing.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.582
[laughs] Hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.586
Take those.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.370
Dude, you do not want
your dick falling off

09:05.414 --> 09:07.808
the first night you pull it
out of the attic.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.853
I'’m keeping my pants
zipped up tonight, man.

she'’s a he!

09:14.902 --> 09:16.468
And I'’m fucking proud of you!

09:42.320 --> 09:43.452

09:44.671 --> 09:45.672

10:16.267 --> 10:17.312
Do you do this a lot?

10:19.053 --> 10:20.054
What'’s that?

10:20.707 --> 10:21.708
Call that number,

10:22.578 --> 10:24.058
go out with random girls
like me.

10:25.059 --> 10:27.278
No. [chuckles]
This was my first time.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.455
I didn'’t think people
called hotlines anymore.

10:30.499 --> 10:31.848
Figured I'’d be the only one
on the phone.

10:32.762 --> 10:33.981
Do you think
it was worth it?

10:36.070 --> 10:37.201
Sure.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.203
[chuckles]

10:39.247 --> 10:40.727
It'’s good to meet
cool people like you.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.731
Have you called
the number before?

10:44.774 --> 10:46.994
[chuckles] A few times.

10:47.037 --> 10:50.693
So you'’ve been on
a lot of dates like this?

10:50.737 --> 10:53.261
If I told you
I'’d been on a lot
of these kind of dates,

10:53.304 --> 10:54.828
you might get
the wrong impression.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.004
What'’s the impression?

10:58.396 --> 10:59.441
That I'’m a slut.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.619
No. [scoffs]

11:03.663 --> 11:05.926
Don'’t say that.
There'’s nothing wrong
with being a sl--

11:09.016 --> 11:11.279
I mean,
wanting to make new friends,

11:11.322 --> 11:12.715
that'’s all we're doing here,
right?

11:16.937 --> 11:19.069
It seems like
you'’re very uncomfortable.

11:21.202 --> 11:22.638
Like you don'’t
want to be here.

11:24.596 --> 11:25.641
I, uh...

11:26.337 --> 11:27.338
I'’m happy to be here.

11:28.078 --> 11:29.210
We'’re having a great time.

11:32.430 --> 11:36.173
I apologize for making you
feel uncomfortable tonight.
That wasn'’t my intention.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.224
You want to get out of here?

11:49.099 --> 11:50.579
So where are we going next?

11:51.754 --> 11:53.451
Figured I'’d be a gentleman
and get you home early.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.759
No, I don'’t...
I don'’t want to go there.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.761
I don'’t want to be
in that house with
all those people, you know?

12:00.937 --> 12:02.765
We can go to the movies.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.246
[sighs] Well,
can'’t really get to know you
in the movies.

12:07.596 --> 12:08.858
Why don'’t we go to your place?

12:36.320 --> 12:38.758
Hey, uh,
you can'’t smoke in here.

12:39.976 --> 12:41.064
Why?

12:42.283 --> 12:43.327
Manager'’s rules.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.247
You want a drag?

12:50.291 --> 12:51.901
I quit. I don'’t smoke anymore.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.338
Well, I hope
you didn'’t quit everything,

12:55.600 --> 12:57.472
because that would be
really fucking boring.

13:14.881 --> 13:15.882
You like it?

13:16.447 --> 13:17.492
[chuckles]

13:18.362 --> 13:19.407
Yeah.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.759
Just...
You know, quick drawing.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.284
Nobody'’s ever drawn me before.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.291
Which part of me
do you want to draw next?

13:40.123 --> 13:41.255
The front...

13:45.476 --> 13:46.521
or the back?

13:50.655 --> 13:52.744
Maybe we should pick this up
another time.

13:52.788 --> 13:53.833
What'’s the matter?

13:55.269 --> 13:56.836
Are you scared of me,
Jonathan?

13:59.795 --> 14:01.405
Don'’t you like my body?

14:05.453 --> 14:06.584
Look at me.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.023
Look at me.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.421
Do you like my body?

14:20.816 --> 14:22.426
Yes.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.907
Well, what is it, then?
I'’m not good enough for you?

14:25.734 --> 14:26.866
Is that it?

14:27.475 --> 14:29.564
I... I just...

14:29.607 --> 14:31.783
I shouldn'’t be doing
any of this. It'’s...

14:31.827 --> 14:32.872
It'’s not a good idea.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.657
This was your idea.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.833
You called the number,
remember?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.835
You said you wanted
to fuck a girl like me.

14:40.531 --> 14:41.706
Isn'’t that what you said?

14:43.839 --> 14:45.406
I don'’t know.

14:45.449 --> 14:49.062
You said
you wanted it like this.

14:49.105 --> 14:50.150
Right here.

14:51.281 --> 14:52.935
Say it.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.503
Say, "I want this to happen."

14:58.985 --> 14:59.986
I want this to happen.

15:01.422 --> 15:02.553
Say it again.

15:03.598 --> 15:04.686
I want this to happen.

15:07.341 --> 15:08.733
Thank you, sweetie.

[Eric]
Ringworm, scabies, herpes.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.702
Dude, it could be anything,
to be honest.

16:04.746 --> 16:06.878
[laughing]

16:08.402 --> 16:09.881
Oh, shit.

16:09.925 --> 16:11.840
-You do not wanna see this.
-What is it?

16:12.493 --> 16:14.190
What is it, man?

16:14.234 --> 16:16.758
-Dude, what--
-I can'’t even pronounce it.
Chill out.

16:16.801 --> 16:20.283
Okay, do you realize that
you paid three bucks a minute...

16:21.545 --> 16:24.026
for a fucking STD?
You know that, right?

16:24.070 --> 16:26.681
You don'’t know it's an STD.
I mean, it could be poison ivy.

16:26.724 --> 16:30.032
I just didn'’t know
you could get poison ivy
from vaginas.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.165
Maybe it'’s poison oak.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.080
Or just an allergic reaction.
I-I don'’t know.

16:34.123 --> 16:37.822
Maybe it was the fried chicken.
I don'’t fucking know, dude.

16:37.866 --> 16:40.521
It wouldn'’t grow this fast
if it was an STD.

16:40.564 --> 16:45.091
Or maybe you barebacked
a disgusting phone skank

16:45.134 --> 16:46.831
and you did not use protection.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.920
She wasn'’t a skank at all.

16:48.964 --> 16:51.358
She was actually really sweet,

16:51.401 --> 16:53.882
and pretty,
and really interesting and...

16:53.925 --> 16:58.017
So, a sweet and cute
and interesting phone skank.
Got it.

16:58.060 --> 17:01.498
People have unprotected sex
all the time
and nothing happens.

17:01.542 --> 17:02.804
[lighter flicking]

17:03.283 --> 17:04.762
[sighs]

17:04.806 --> 17:06.460
Dude, it fucking burns.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.854
You need to see a doctor,
like, now.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.423
I'’m not going to the doctors.
You know I hate doctors.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.559
You'’re going to infect
the whole store with that shit

17:18.602 --> 17:21.344
and I'’m not going to allow
that kind of health violation,

17:21.387 --> 17:23.390
not in my store,
not on my watch.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.305
You'’re smoking weed
in the cooler,

17:25.348 --> 17:26.696
talking about
health violations.

17:27.481 --> 17:28.525
I'’m serious, man.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.659
You'’re not working today.

17:31.702 --> 17:34.618
And you'’re gonna go
get your shit fixed,
or don'’t come back.

17:36.142 --> 17:38.057
I'’m telling you this
as your friend.

17:39.362 --> 17:40.537
And more importantly,

17:41.495 --> 17:42.800
as your shift manager.

17:44.324 --> 17:45.890
Now get your dirty dick
out of here.

17:49.807 --> 17:50.808
[sighs]

17:52.593 --> 17:54.551
[doctor]
And how long do you say
you'’ve had it?

17:54.595 --> 17:56.162
[Jonathan]
I just got it this morning.

17:56.205 --> 17:57.380
All right.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.733
-Mostly concentrated
in this area?
-Yes.

18:02.777 --> 18:05.693
Okay I'’m gonna apply
some pressure on a few areas.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.782
I want you to tell me
if you feel anything unusual.

18:07.825 --> 18:09.740
All right.
You feel a sharp pain
right here, though?

18:10.959 --> 18:13.222
-Anything?
-Just burns.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.355
Is the rash radiating
down your genitals?

18:15.398 --> 18:18.836
-Yeah.
-Okay.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.752
-And you said you penetrated
your partner without a condom?
-Yeah.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.103
So, first I'’m gonna
tell you this:
don'’t do that.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.191
It'’s a bad idea.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.541
All right.
What I'’m gonna do

18:27.584 --> 18:29.108
is I'’m gonna take
a small sample here.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.720
Great.

18:32.763 --> 18:35.201
I can'’t diagnose you right now,
but I can tell you
I'’m not concerned.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.638
I see these kinds of things
all the time.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.727
Patients come back
a few days later,
and it'’s gone.

18:39.770 --> 18:42.817
Don'’t you think this rash
is pretty bad to get
after, like, 12 hours?

18:42.860 --> 18:45.907
After unprotected sex?
Yeah, it'’s not ideal.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.169
All right?

18:47.213 --> 18:48.475
What I can tell you is,

18:48.518 --> 18:50.129
it blisters a lot like herpes,

18:50.172 --> 18:51.347
but it'’s happening
a lot quicker.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.088
So I have herpes?

18:55.482 --> 18:58.833
We will not know anything
until the lab results
come back in.

18:58.876 --> 18:59.964
How long is that gonna take?

19:00.748 --> 19:02.141
Two days, maybe three.

19:02.184 --> 19:05.187
[groans]
Can'’t we get the results sooner?

19:05.231 --> 19:07.537
Look, I looked on the Internet,
and it could be
a number of things.

19:07.581 --> 19:12.194
Ringworm, syphilis, cancer,
MS, poison oak.

19:12.238 --> 19:16.067
Is the Internet your doctor?
No. I am.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.982
What I would do is,
I would track down
your partner.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.593
I'’d see if she was exhibiting
the same symptoms.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.769
She might know
exactly what that rash is.

19:21.812 --> 19:23.553
In the meantime,
you'’re gonna take this cream.

19:23.597 --> 19:25.381
You'’re gonna apply it
three times a day

19:25.425 --> 19:27.122
and I'’d also invest
in some condoms.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.212
[footsteps fading]

19:30.256 --> 19:31.300
[door opens]

19:31.953 --> 19:33.084

19:46.707 --> 19:48.535
-[tone beeps]
-[recorded voice] We'’re sorry.

19:48.578 --> 19:50.537
You have reached a number that has been disconnected

19:50.580 --> 19:52.278
or is no longer in service.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.339
[knocking]

20:18.565 --> 20:21.263
Hello, sir.
I'’m looking for Dena.
Is she around?

20:21.307 --> 20:23.352
-Dena?
-Yeah, Dena.

20:25.136 --> 20:26.225
Yeah, I don'’t know a Dena.

20:28.096 --> 20:32.013
I picked Dena up
at this address last night.
1366 Torrington Road.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.798
All these houses
look similar.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.365
You might wanna go look around.

20:36.409 --> 20:38.106
I know it was here.
Maybe she goes by another name.

20:38.585 --> 20:39.499
Uh, look...

20:41.762 --> 20:43.633
This is Dena. All right?

20:43.677 --> 20:46.506
She'’s about 30 years old,
really tall, brown hair.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.812
I'’ve never seen
this woman before.

20:48.856 --> 20:51.554
The only people living here
are me and my wife

20:51.598 --> 20:54.514
and trust me,
you didn'’t pick her up
last night.

20:54.557 --> 20:58.561
Look, I picked Dena up
right out front of this house.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.302
She told me she stays here
with some other people.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.217
Well, maybe you should
call your friend

21:02.261 --> 21:04.393
and find out
what her address is.

21:04.437 --> 21:07.178
-Her phone got disconnected.
-Yeah, well,
that'’s not my problem.

21:07.570 --> 21:08.658
Yo!

21:15.056 --> 21:16.579
Get off my property. Now!

21:19.626 --> 21:20.670
Sorry to bother you.

21:44.564 --> 21:47.262
[on TV]
Hi. I'’m Dr. Jason Ronaldi.

21:47.306 --> 21:51.310
Every hour, 12 people die
from the effects of alcohol
and drug abuse.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.007
Addiction is a disease,

21:53.050 --> 21:56.663
an epidemic that we can control one patient at a time.

21:56.706 --> 21:59.492
[woman] When I just moved to America, crack became my best friend

21:59.535 --> 22:02.582
drug addiction hotline taught me is my worst enemy.

22:06.237 --> 22:11.242
Hi. Yes, I called this number
a few days ago and
I met a girl using this service.

22:11.286 --> 22:15.029
I'’m looking for some help.
I was wondering if you can
give me some more information.

22:15.072 --> 22:18.424
I don'’t know, can you look,
over the last couple days,
first name Dena?

22:18.467 --> 22:21.427
[man] I'’m not permitted
to give anything away
to any of our customers.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.907
Can you just give me
an e-mail address or something?

22:23.951 --> 22:27.737
I'’m not permitted to release any personal information. What do you not understand?

22:27.781 --> 22:30.218
Can I speak to your manager?

22:30.261 --> 22:32.829
I am the manager.
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

22:33.917 --> 22:35.789
-No.
-All right, then.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.834
You have a good evening,
Jonathan Marsh.

22:37.878 --> 22:39.227
We'’ll be seeing you real soon.

-No, thanks.

25:10.117 --> 25:13.207
Do you remember
seeing me here last night?

25:13.250 --> 25:14.991
I sat at this table
with a woman,

25:15.992 --> 25:17.037
dark hair,

25:17.864 --> 25:19.518
kinda looked like that.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.520
Sorry, honey.
It'’s too many tables.

25:29.745 --> 25:31.181
[phone buzzing]

25:38.667 --> 25:40.321
Yo, Eric.

25:40.364 --> 25:41.670
[Eric]
Jonathan, where you at?

25:42.323 --> 25:44.064
I'’m at Jenny's diner.

25:44.107 --> 25:46.675
-Are you alone?
-Yeah.

25:46.719 --> 25:50.418
Listen, you'’re in trouble. Come over to my place, and I'’ll explain.

25:50.461 --> 25:52.507
What do you mean I'’m in trouble?

25:52.551 --> 25:55.075
Just get over here now and we can talk, okay?

25:55.118 --> 25:56.685
I'’m not fucking around, man.

25:56.729 --> 25:57.860
I'’ll be there
in five minutes.

26:01.037 --> 26:04.258
[siren wails in distance]

26:45.212 --> 26:46.256
Eric?

26:50.478 --> 26:51.522
Eric, you here?

27:02.229 --> 27:03.447
[Eric] I'’m back here!

27:05.493 --> 27:06.494
Where you at?

27:07.103 --> 27:08.148
[Eric] In my room!

27:12.979 --> 27:14.633
Dude, are you fucking with me?

27:22.902 --> 27:24.425
-Eric?
-I'’m here.

27:42.051 --> 27:43.487
[gasps]

27:43.531 --> 27:45.272
Dude, if you'’re under the bed...

28:09.557 --> 28:11.994
[shouting] Get off!

28:12.038 --> 28:13.604

[police radio chatter]

29:10.052 --> 29:12.402
[woman] Did you receive any messages...

29:21.020 --> 29:22.238
[Dena] Say it, Jonathan.

29:23.109 --> 29:25.154
Say, "I want this to happen."

29:35.121 --> 29:38.211
Good morning, Jonathan.
How are you doing this morning?

29:41.910 --> 29:43.433
Not good.

29:43.477 --> 29:45.827
[sighs] Do you remember
talking to me last night?

29:48.612 --> 29:49.657
No.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.529
Do you remember
how you got here?

29:55.489 --> 29:56.925
The police?

29:56.969 --> 29:58.666
That'’s right.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.102
You'’re in a bit of trouble
right now,

30:00.146 --> 30:02.104
and you'’re gonna be
staying here with me

30:02.148 --> 30:04.237
until we figure out
what'’s going on with you.
Do you understand?

30:05.629 --> 30:09.808
Can you tell me
why you did this
to your friend Eric?

30:13.115 --> 30:15.074
All right,
this happened last night.

30:15.117 --> 30:17.119
-Can you explain this?
-I wouldn'’t do that
to Eric.

30:17.772 --> 30:18.860
You did this.

30:33.179 --> 30:34.180
Hey, pal.

30:36.051 --> 30:37.792
[Dr. Ronaldi]
All right, Jonathan.
Everybody in this room

30:37.836 --> 30:39.968
cares about you
and wants to see you well.

30:40.012 --> 30:42.928
But right now,
we'’re all very concerned
about your well-being.

30:42.971 --> 30:46.583
According to your parents,
you'’ve been exhibiting some
very erratic behavior lately.

30:46.627 --> 30:49.760
Some might even call it
conspiratorial in nature.

30:49.804 --> 30:52.851
Can you please tell us
why you did this
to your friend Eric?

30:56.245 --> 30:57.507
I wouldn'’t attack Eric.

30:58.813 --> 31:00.119
S-Somebody jumped me.

31:00.859 --> 31:01.947
That'’s not true.

31:03.078 --> 31:04.775
I came home,

31:04.819 --> 31:08.127
and you were
just standing there,
completely catatonic,

31:08.170 --> 31:10.346
like-like a zombie,

31:10.390 --> 31:12.914
and so I went up to you,
and I tried to wake you up.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.655
And then you went
completely fucking apeshit.

31:14.698 --> 31:17.527
I'’m sorry for swearing,
Mr. and Mrs. Marsh.

31:17.571 --> 31:19.007
But I'’m just...

31:19.051 --> 31:21.444
I'’m really frustrated

31:21.488 --> 31:24.534
because I'’ve done nothing
but help you.

31:24.578 --> 31:27.668
Okay? I gave you a job,
I'’ve helped you
with your social life,

31:27.711 --> 31:30.323
I tried to help you get girls
the right way.

31:32.847 --> 31:34.544
And you do this to me,
man?

31:34.588 --> 31:35.763
[Jonathan]
You called me.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.331
You said to come over,
that I was...

31:39.375 --> 31:41.073
That I was in trouble.

31:41.116 --> 31:42.639
[Eric]
I didn'’t call you.

31:42.683 --> 31:44.990
Okay? I never called you.

31:45.033 --> 31:47.296
Do you see now
why we'’re all concerned
about your well-being?

31:48.776 --> 31:51.257
-You think I made this up?
-Considering your track record,

31:51.300 --> 31:53.955
I think your parents
have a right to be concerned.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.957
One bad day in high school
doesn'’t mean

31:56.001 --> 31:57.785
you can throw it in my face
the rest of my life.

31:57.828 --> 32:01.136
Jonathan, it was more than
one bad day, okay?

32:01.180 --> 32:02.572
It was a lot of bad days.

32:03.095 --> 32:04.139
And...

32:05.184 --> 32:06.446
it'’s happening again.

32:11.146 --> 32:15.890
This rash is real,
and I want it tested.

32:15.934 --> 32:19.938
Toxins, poisons, bacteria,
malignant tumors, all of it.

32:20.808 --> 32:22.244
[breathing heavily]

32:24.943 --> 32:26.988
Dena wanted to poison me.

32:27.032 --> 32:30.122
Jonathan, listen to me.
Nobody here
wants to poison you, son.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.260
-[Mr. Marsh] Jonathan?
-[Dr. Ronaldi] Hey, kid.

32:38.304 --> 32:40.784
Jonathan, come on,
wake up, buddy. Come on.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.177
Wake up, Jonathan. Jonathan!

32:43.091 --> 32:44.136
Wake up, Jonathan.

32:44.179 --> 32:45.441
Can you hear me,
Jonathan?

32:45.485 --> 32:47.182
Give him
the full 72 hours.

32:47.226 --> 32:48.879

34:20.319 --> 34:22.799
[music playing on car stereo]

34:25.498 --> 34:27.848
It'’s gonna be so nice
to have you back home again,

34:28.456 --> 34:30.110
just where you belong.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.938
Doctors don'’t always know
what'’s best.

34:32.592 --> 34:33.984
Sometimes moms know.

34:37.900 --> 34:39.338
Oh, my God.

34:39.380 --> 34:41.121
-[Mr. Marsh] What?
-You'’re bleeding.

34:41.731 --> 34:44.299
-Ouch.
-Oh, shit.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.304
Just try to keep it
off the upholstery,
all right, kiddo?

34:56.050 --> 35:00.141
["This Old Town"

35:02.100 --> 35:03.101
[sighs]

35:09.542 --> 35:12.022
Uh, you know what? I'’ll, uh...
Let me take this up
to your room

35:12.066 --> 35:14.024
and you go clean up
your nose, okay?

35:18.768 --> 35:20.640
Think of this as vacation.

35:21.684 --> 35:24.774
No responsibility, no stress.

35:24.818 --> 35:27.821
In a couple of days,
you'’re gonna feel all better.

35:28.474 --> 35:29.518
I hope so.

35:29.562 --> 35:31.303
Of course you will.

35:40.529 --> 35:42.314
[Mr. Marsh whispers]
How long has he been in there?

35:42.357 --> 35:43.793
[Mrs. Marsh] I don'’t know.
It'’s been a while.

35:43.837 --> 35:46.100
[Mr. Marsh] Once he had
some razors in there.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.058
-Is there anything sharp in
there for him to hurt himself?
-I don'’t remember.

35:48.102 --> 35:50.800
[Mr. Marsh]
I'’m not the one who goes
in the bathroom anymore.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.769
We'’re so happy
to have you home.

36:02.812 --> 36:04.727
-That looks good, honey.
-Oh.

36:09.428 --> 36:12.213
Oh, uh, you know what,
why don'’t we, uh...

36:12.257 --> 36:13.562
Why don'’t we get
those other ones, huh?

36:16.304 --> 36:18.393
Less dishes for your mom, kiddo.
[chuckles]

36:19.046 --> 36:20.178
[cutlery clatters]

36:23.050 --> 36:24.182
Here you go.

36:26.749 --> 36:27.794
[clears throat]
Thank you.

36:31.406 --> 36:34.540
Bet it'’s been a while.
Bet it'’s nice to have
a home-cooked meal, huh?

36:38.021 --> 36:39.066
Are you serious?

36:42.939 --> 36:46.247
Look, I appreciate you guys
offering to take care of me
the next couple days,

36:46.291 --> 36:49.076
but I think it'’s better
if I get my truck
and stay at my place.

36:49.119 --> 36:51.252
You know what? [sighs]

36:51.296 --> 36:54.168
You'’re staying with us,
all right, for a while.

36:55.778 --> 36:58.607
Whatever medications and creams
the doctor gave me,
I can use at my place.

36:58.651 --> 37:02.481
You'’re not--
You'’re not going to your place.
You'’re staying with us, okay?

37:05.179 --> 37:06.224
There'’s no discussion.

37:07.790 --> 37:10.793
It'’s my apartment, my truck.
Please give me my keys now.

37:11.316 --> 37:12.839
[rummaging]

37:13.492 --> 37:15.494
Mom, where are my keys?

37:15.537 --> 37:17.322
You don'’t need
to be driving, honey.

37:17.365 --> 37:18.975
Your dad and I can get you
where you need to be.

37:19.019 --> 37:20.803
[sighs] I can get me
where I need to be.

37:20.847 --> 37:22.675
[Mr. Marsh] You know what?
You'’ve been driving

37:22.718 --> 37:25.112
on expired tags
since last year.

37:25.155 --> 37:27.245
All right? We don'’t hear
from you in months,

37:27.288 --> 37:30.204
and then you just spent
72 hours in a psych ward.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.945
Now, you'’re not getting
that truck,

37:31.988 --> 37:33.425
and you'’re not getting
that apartment.

37:33.468 --> 37:34.817
[exhales in frustration]

37:34.861 --> 37:37.820
-[wood splinters]
-Nice. Real nice.

37:37.864 --> 37:40.649
How is living with my parents
supposed to help with stress?

37:40.693 --> 37:42.477
I'’m embarrassed,
you'’re embarrassed.

37:42.521 --> 37:44.262
Let'’s save each other
the trouble here.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.133
All right, you know what?

37:46.176 --> 37:49.876
Dr. Ronaldi doesn'’t think
you'’re fit to live by yourself.

37:49.919 --> 37:52.357
-Fuck Dr. Ronaldi.
-That'’s great.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.708
We can'’t afford
to keep paying half your rent
while you figure your life out.

37:57.187 --> 37:59.059
Figure my life out?

37:59.102 --> 38:01.453
What do you think I'’m doing?
I'’ve been figuring it out.

38:02.976 --> 38:06.196
I'’m following every fucking step
in this book
that you guys gave me.

38:06.240 --> 38:10.244
This "figuring
your life out" book
that you guys gave me.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.941
What more can I do?

38:11.985 --> 38:14.422
I work 60 hours a week.

38:14.466 --> 38:17.120
Oh, yeah, and we'’re so proud
of your accomplishments
at that liquor store.

38:17.164 --> 38:19.166
-[Mrs. Marsh] Honey.
-[Mr. Marsh] No, no, honey, no.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.950
No. You know what?
He needs to hear this.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.561
All right? His friends
are starting careers,

38:22.604 --> 38:24.780
and he can'’t figure out
how to pay car insurance.

38:25.738 --> 38:27.174
You guys want me to be better?

38:28.175 --> 38:32.310
Believe me, this is real.
Dena was real.

38:33.572 --> 38:35.791
I should get support
from my parents!

38:36.836 --> 38:39.229
P.S. It'’s not a liquor store.

38:39.273 --> 38:40.970
It'’s a lifestyle
convenience boutique.

38:43.712 --> 38:44.757
That'’s awesome.

We need to leave right now.

It'’s here. It's here for me.

40:53.407 --> 40:54.756
What'’s wrong with you guys?

40:56.062 --> 40:57.324
Stop, Jonathan.

41:00.283 --> 41:02.721
-Just sit down, Jonathan.
-What are you doing?

41:02.764 --> 41:04.287
-You'’re not going anywhere.
-We have to go.

41:04.331 --> 41:05.898
What are you doing?
Get off me.

41:05.941 --> 41:07.682
-Just relax.
-Fuck. Just... Fuck!

It'’s all right.
It'’s just a dream.

-Open your mouth.

41:12.948 --> 41:14.907
It'’s gonna make you feel better.
There you go.

-Just relax.
It'’s not real, okay?

-Now just open your mouth.
It'’s okay.

No, Jonathan! Stop! Stop!

-Stop!

[man on intercom]
Jonathan, I'’m sorry.
I can'’t let you in here.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.457
Look, I just need to grab
a couple things.

43:10.500 --> 43:12.154
I need shoes. I need money.
Please.

43:12.198 --> 43:13.634
I'’ve been instructed to call the police

if you try and enter your apartment.

I-I don'’t mean
to bother you.

44:13.868 --> 44:15.870
I just, uh, lost my phone
and wallet last night.

44:15.914 --> 44:18.481
Is there any way
you can spare any money?
I'’d really appreciate it.

44:19.526 --> 44:21.267
-Sorry.
-No problem, man.

44:29.536 --> 44:32.017
Excuse me? Sir?

44:32.060 --> 44:34.976
Excuse me.
I don'’t mean to bother you.
This is really embarrassing,

44:35.020 --> 44:37.457
but any chance you have
a couple of dollars
you can lend me?

44:37.500 --> 44:38.676
I just need
to make a phone call.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.375
How much you need?

44:42.418 --> 44:44.377
Just... A couple of dollars
would be great.

44:45.770 --> 44:47.946
Okay. Okay.

44:50.383 --> 44:51.993
You'’re not gonna buy liquor
with this, are you?

44:52.733 --> 44:54.039
No, I... I don'’t drink.

44:54.779 --> 44:55.780
You gonna get high?

44:56.476 --> 44:57.607
No, I'’m just...

44:59.392 --> 45:02.003
This is really embarrassing.
I'’d pay you back if I could.
I just...

45:02.047 --> 45:03.657
-I just need
to make a phone call.
-Okay.

45:05.050 --> 45:06.355
Here'’s your fucking money.

45:07.443 --> 45:08.923
What was that?

45:08.967 --> 45:10.882
You remember me now? Hmm?

45:10.925 --> 45:13.754
Yeah, you tried to punk me
in front of my girlfriend.

45:13.798 --> 45:17.018
"What size condoms do you wear?
You want the piña colada?"

45:17.062 --> 45:19.542
What are you,
some kind of fucking
stand-up comedian?

45:19.586 --> 45:22.850
Man, you were in my store.
I wasn'’t trying to punk you.
I was trying to help.

45:22.894 --> 45:25.984
Yeah,
why don'’t you help yourself
by getting some fucking shoes?

45:27.072 --> 45:30.075
All right? And if I ever
run into you again,

45:30.118 --> 45:33.034
and I see you eye-fucking
my girlfriend like that,

45:33.078 --> 45:35.863
I'’m gonna beat the fuck
out of your little
crackhead ass.

45:36.559 --> 45:37.604
All right?

45:42.348 --> 45:43.523
Take your money.

45:44.350 --> 45:46.265
I don'’t need it.

45:46.308 --> 45:49.181
Are you serious right now, dude?
Are you fucking serious
right now?

45:49.224 --> 45:51.139
You wanna go?
You wanna go,
motherfucker?

45:51.618 --> 45:53.359
[grunting]

45:53.402 --> 45:56.275
You see, I'’m an alpha male,
and you are my bitch.

45:56.318 --> 45:57.406
-[man] Break it up!
-All right?

45:57.450 --> 45:59.495
Hey! Break it up! Break it up!

45:59.539 --> 46:02.063
This guy'’s accosting
your customers, man.

46:02.107 --> 46:04.892
Hey, you can'’t--
You get out of here. Okay?

46:04.936 --> 46:06.807
You can'’t beg for money
on my property.

46:06.851 --> 46:09.027
I'’m not begging.
I'’m a paying customer.

46:09.070 --> 46:10.463
-I know how it works.
-You go now.

46:10.506 --> 46:11.812
Okay? I call the police.

46:11.856 --> 46:13.248
Hey, nobody wants you,
all right?

46:13.292 --> 46:14.554
Get your crackhead ass
out of here.

46:16.295 --> 46:18.514
You see this? Oh, yeah.

46:18.558 --> 46:20.516
It'’s all over you.

46:20.560 --> 46:23.171
[chuckles]
I hope your girlfriend likes it
when your dick falls off.

46:24.694 --> 46:26.174
-Cocksucker.
-[alpha male]
What the fuck was that?

46:26.218 --> 46:27.610
[man] You should go
to a doctor, man.

46:31.136 --> 46:33.051
Hey, man, what was that?

46:33.094 --> 46:35.140
No, for real, what was that?
Dude, what the fuck was that?

46:35.183 --> 46:36.402
Hey. Hello, there. Hello--

46:36.445 --> 46:38.230
Whoa, hey, what was that, dude?

46:38.273 --> 46:39.361
Some guy.

[rap continues]

46:52.418 --> 46:53.723
[line ringing]

46:57.249 --> 46:58.946
[Eric on machine] Yo, you'’ve reached the ERC.

46:58.990 --> 47:00.556
Leave a message after the beep.

47:00.992 --> 47:02.210

sudden bad luck,

47:13.265 --> 47:15.702

before the evil destroys you."

47:32.719 --> 47:34.721

47:55.785 --> 47:58.049
Hey. No shoes, no service.

47:59.833 --> 48:01.008
If you can make
an exception...

48:02.314 --> 48:04.316
I'’d really like to speak
to this lady.

48:04.359 --> 48:05.404
Are you fucked up?

48:05.752 --> 48:07.275
No.

48:07.319 --> 48:10.844
Look, I just really wanna
talk to Ms. Melinda.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.933
What do you wanna talk
to Melinda about?

48:12.977 --> 48:16.023
Well, I'’m experiencing
everything the flier says.

48:16.067 --> 48:18.721
Bad luck, illness,
feeling persistent evil.

48:19.548 --> 48:21.115
The day I got this rash,

48:22.116 --> 48:24.162
Melinda was watching me
at Jenny'’s diner.

48:24.205 --> 48:26.947
Why would Melinda be
watching me the same day
all this shit started?

48:26.991 --> 48:28.470
There'’s no way
this is a coincidence.

48:29.036 --> 48:30.081
Please.

48:32.692 --> 48:33.736
Wait here.

48:38.611 --> 48:40.352

There'’s a guy here to see you.

48:40.395 --> 48:41.919
-Yeah, what does he want?
-He'’s got a rash.

48:43.050 --> 48:45.270
[Melinda] Can we trust him?
Does he have money?

48:45.313 --> 48:48.751
I don'’t know.
He says he met you in a diner.
He'’s got a rash on his arm.

48:48.795 --> 48:51.015
How big is the rash?
What is his...

48:52.407 --> 48:53.539
-Yeah.
-I'’ll give him this.

48:53.582 --> 48:54.932
Give him the...

48:57.499 --> 48:58.892
You need this.

49:00.372 --> 49:01.590
Well, it'’s not free.

49:02.026 --> 49:03.201
How much?

49:03.244 --> 49:04.419
How badly you want help?

49:15.169 --> 49:16.214
That'’s all I got.

-What do I do with this?
-It'’s just to get you started.

49:35.233 --> 49:37.626
Melinda will meet with you
at Blue High Shack.

49:37.670 --> 49:39.541
-You know where that is?
-Yeah.

49:39.585 --> 49:43.067
-6:00 p.m. Don'’t be late.
-Why can'’t we just meet here?

49:43.110 --> 49:45.373
No, we don'’t bring
that kind of shit
into our store.

with you?

52:49.688 --> 52:50.732
No, it'’s just me.

52:52.734 --> 52:54.649
I don'’t want any bullshit.
Do you understand me?

52:56.782 --> 52:59.045
-I said, do you understand me?
-Yes.

53:00.002 --> 53:01.178
Yes, I do.

53:12.363 --> 53:14.103
Show me your rash, Jonathan.

53:25.114 --> 53:26.333
What do you think it is?

53:28.683 --> 53:29.728
Poison.

53:31.033 --> 53:32.818
This is worse than poison.

53:35.603 --> 53:36.691
We have work to do.

53:52.316 --> 53:55.275
It doesn'’t matter
how much money they have,

53:55.319 --> 53:57.495
how nice they smell.

53:59.323 --> 54:03.065
Doesn'’t matter. They're vile.
They'’re filth.

54:05.894 --> 54:07.374
You'’ve already been

54:09.115 --> 54:10.638

54:22.607 --> 54:24.913
It'’s the start

If you have what I had,
time is not on your side.

[voice warbling]
The solution is to make...
Spread it out.

54:47.458 --> 54:49.808
They tried to seed you
with that woman.

54:49.851 --> 54:51.026
If it took root,

54:52.071 --> 54:54.421
you'’ll find it
just under these scabs.

54:55.379 --> 54:57.294
-Find what?
-You'’ll see.

55:00.427 --> 55:02.516
It'’s not that far
beneath your skin.

What can I do for you,
Jonathan?

58:37.731 --> 58:40.473
What happened last night?
What did you do to me?

58:40.517 --> 58:42.257
You started
the cleansing process.

It'’s what you wanted.
It'’s what you need.

58:46.653 --> 58:47.959
Explain to me what I saw.

58:48.002 --> 58:52.093
I pulled black shit
out of my arm.

58:52.137 --> 58:54.226
In the morning, it was gone.

58:54.269 --> 58:56.576
You saw everything
you needed to see
with your own eyes.

58:56.620 --> 58:59.318
You know exactly
what'’s going on.

58:59.361 --> 59:03.452
That is the problem.
I have no idea what'’s happening.

you need to help yourself.

then you deserve
what'’s coming.

I know your fragile mind
can'’t handle this, Jonathan.

59:19.381 --> 59:21.079

out there.

is sacrificing people.

I'’m really sorry
for flipping out,

I'’m telling you I need help.

Look, I know this doesn'’t
look good, all right?

01:06:47.699 --> 01:06:49.701
And I'’m this close to getting
in big fucking trouble,

01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:51.224
but I had to figure it out.

01:06:51.268 --> 01:06:54.445

Why am I all fucked up?

01:06:55.054 --> 01:06:56.186

and it'’s all happening

01:07:03.758 --> 01:07:06.152
at 1366 Torrington Road
just like I always said.

01:07:06.892 --> 01:07:08.676
Wait, you think...

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.070
-You think witches
are doing this?
-Yes.

01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:15.596
Look, this coven,
they sent Dena out
to fucking find suckers like me.

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.859
And here I am, all right?
Look at me.

01:07:17.903 --> 01:07:20.819
Now they'’re gonna sacrifice me.
They'’re gonna kill me!

01:07:20.862 --> 01:07:22.473
Wait.
They'’re trying to kill you?

01:07:22.516 --> 01:07:26.259
Yes. Dena infected me,
all right? She marked me.

01:07:26.303 --> 01:07:28.348
And now they'’re coming
for their harvest, all right?

01:07:28.392 --> 01:07:30.350
I pulled some of it out.
Look, right here.

01:07:30.394 --> 01:07:32.700
Black string, dude.
It'’s in there.

01:07:32.744 --> 01:07:34.485
But the doctors
never looked for it.

01:07:34.528 --> 01:07:36.487
You cut your arm open, dude?

01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:38.489
Yeah. With this.

01:07:38.532 --> 01:07:42.232
I mean, but I had to.
I-I had to pull it out.

01:07:42.275 --> 01:07:44.103
I need you to come with me,
all right?

01:07:44.147 --> 01:07:46.323
I need a witness.
They won'’t believe me
by myself.

01:07:46.366 --> 01:07:48.238
Just come with me.
Will you come with me?

01:07:50.022 --> 01:07:51.937
Yeah. Of course, man.

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:56.202
Look, I know you think
I'’m crazy. [chuckles]

01:07:56.246 --> 01:07:59.031
I mean, I would think I'’m crazy.
But I'’m not, all right?

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.120
We have to get them
to remove the curse now

01:08:01.773 --> 01:08:02.817
and if they don'’t...

01:08:04.036 --> 01:08:05.081
If they don'’t
remove the curse, what?

01:08:06.038 --> 01:08:08.258
Then I have to... destroy them.

01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:12.871
Whoa. What do you mean
you have to destroy them?

01:08:12.914 --> 01:08:14.394
-What does that mean?
-You know.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:16.743
Wow.

Okay. Okay.

Okay, place is still open.
I gotta close up. All right?

01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:29.844
So why don'’t you go wash up,
eat some snacks,

01:08:29.888 --> 01:08:31.890
then we'’ll go find these people
and we'’ll talk to them.

01:08:31.933 --> 01:08:33.109

01:09:50.533 --> 01:09:52.710
Oh, nothing.
It was an accident.

01:09:57.845 --> 01:09:59.020
[siren chirps]

01:09:59.847 --> 01:10:01.066
Sorry, I have to go.

01:10:04.591 --> 01:10:06.071
Why are the cops here?

01:10:06.114 --> 01:10:09.422
Dude, you'’ve been missing
for three days.

01:10:09.466 --> 01:10:11.772
Your parents are worried
about you. We all are.

01:10:11.816 --> 01:10:13.992
Tell them
everything is okay in here.
I'’ll go out the back door.

01:10:14.035 --> 01:10:17.387
Dude, I called them, okay?
You need help.

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:18.779
This is for your own good,
man.

01:10:18.823 --> 01:10:20.303
-Just please--
-You dumb shit!

01:10:20.346 --> 01:10:21.782
Yo! Yo! Jonathan!

01:10:21.826 --> 01:10:23.262
Hey, you put that knife away,
man.

01:10:24.655 --> 01:10:26.309
Jonathan. Hey!

01:10:26.352 --> 01:10:27.701
-Yo, Jonathan!
-[police radio chatter]

01:10:27.745 --> 01:10:28.963
Put the knife down.

01:10:29.007 --> 01:10:31.314
Look, I know where
her dead body is.

01:10:31.357 --> 01:10:34.665
-1366 Torrington Road.
-Put the knife on the ground.

01:10:34.708 --> 01:10:36.841
I'’ll surrender!
If you just take me
to that house.

01:10:36.884 --> 01:10:40.236
I'’m not fucking resisting.
I'’m on your team.

01:10:40.279 --> 01:10:42.803
Blue Lives Matter.
Hands up. Don'’t shoot!

01:10:42.847 --> 01:10:45.110
Just take me
to that fucking house, please!

01:10:45.153 --> 01:10:47.721
-Yo, put that knife down.
They'’re gonna shoot you, bro.
-Goddamn! Stop!

01:10:47.765 --> 01:10:49.462
[cop]
Put the knife on the ground.

01:10:49.506 --> 01:10:51.203
If you put the knife down,
they won'’t shoot you.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:52.987
Why did you fucking
call them?

01:10:53.031 --> 01:10:54.119
-Come on.
-[knife clatters]

01:10:55.686 --> 01:10:57.949
-Hey, hey, shut up, man.
-I'’m not a criminal. I'm not--

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.213
I'’m not a criminal. [sobbing]

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.041
-Give me your hand.
-[thud]

01:11:04.042 --> 01:11:05.739
They'’re gonna kill me!

01:11:07.654 --> 01:11:09.439
Fuck! Let me out!

01:11:12.311 --> 01:11:14.313
-End of the road.
-[panting]

01:11:14.357 --> 01:11:15.619
-You'’re gonna be okay.
-Right arm.

01:11:18.099 --> 01:11:19.492
What are you doing?

01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:20.972
Are you taking any drugs
or medication?

01:11:21.015 --> 01:11:23.322
-Jonathan, do you hear me?
-[machine beeping]

01:11:23.366 --> 01:11:25.411
-How'’s his pulse?
-Pulse is 170, satting at 98.

01:11:25.455 --> 01:11:27.152
You'’re going to feel a prick.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.480
[gasping]

01:11:54.092 --> 01:11:55.833
[thudding]

01:11:58.139 --> 01:11:59.445
[groans]

01:12:08.889 --> 01:12:11.283
-[man 1] No touching.
No touching.
-[man 2] No. No.

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:13.416
-Hey, it was in my bedroom...
-Settle down.

01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:15.331
-...and now it'’s fucking gone.
-Stop. No. No touching.

01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:19.335
[chatter echoing through vent]

01:12:27.821 --> 01:12:29.388
Now what do you think
you'’re doing?

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:31.956
This is a level-three
safety circle.

01:12:33.305 --> 01:12:36.308
It'’s protecting me from things
you can'’t comprehend.

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:38.702
You know the rules.
You'’re gonna have to
clean that up.

01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:43.881
I don'’t want anybody
coming in here
and fucking with my circle.

01:12:43.924 --> 01:12:47.798
Oh, I don'’t intend to mess with
your little Dungeons and Dragons
voodoo anti-curse spell.

01:12:47.841 --> 01:12:50.148
You can tell Dr. Ronaldi
all about it.

01:12:50.931 --> 01:12:52.846
-Now?
-Right now. Let'’s go.

01:12:57.155 --> 01:12:58.635
[Dr. Ronaldi]
You know, Jonathan,

01:12:58.678 --> 01:13:00.376
I have to admit
I'’m a little bit disappointed.

01:13:00.419 --> 01:13:02.726
You failed your drug
and alcohol test.

01:13:02.769 --> 01:13:04.815
Marijuana, cocaine, ketamine.

01:13:04.858 --> 01:13:07.165
[scoffs]
That'’s not possible.

01:13:07.208 --> 01:13:08.253
It'’s all right here.

01:13:12.344 --> 01:13:15.042
-How'’ve you been feeling
the past couple of days?
-Like crap.

01:13:15.086 --> 01:13:17.436
But now you'’re gonna
blame everything
on that bullshit drug test.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.090
Forget about the drug test
for now

01:13:19.133 --> 01:13:21.397
and concentrate on
what we can control in here.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.051
You don'’t feel the medications
are working or at least helping?

01:13:24.095 --> 01:13:26.271
No. I don'’t.

01:13:26.314 --> 01:13:27.707
I don'’t think you are.

01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:30.188
The nurses, the pills,
this place, none of it.

01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:32.451
How'’s your rash?
Tell me about your rash.

01:13:32.495 --> 01:13:36.150
This? This? Fucking painful.

01:13:36.194 --> 01:13:39.023
You wanna give me
some more creams?
Some aloe vera?

01:13:39.066 --> 01:13:40.938
Maybe it'’s just a sunburn.
Oh, wait.

01:13:40.981 --> 01:13:43.288
Maybe the black shit
that I'’ve pulled out of it

01:13:43.331 --> 01:13:45.333
is just a manifestation
of my anxieties.

01:13:45.377 --> 01:13:48.554
-Yeah. That'’s it, huh?
-Do you have to be
so aggressive?

01:13:48.598 --> 01:13:51.252
Oh, my God,
instead of playing games
like I'’m a little kid,

01:13:51.296 --> 01:13:53.690
tell me what you really think
is wrong with me.

01:13:53.733 --> 01:13:56.562
-This is just a simple case
of sleep paralysis.
-[scoffs]

01:13:56.606 --> 01:13:58.912
I'’d say that life stress
and substance abuse

01:13:58.956 --> 01:14:02.481
has triggered a severe psychosis
that'’s gone so far
as waking hallucinations.

01:14:04.004 --> 01:14:06.180
But if you stop listening
to this psychic

01:14:06.224 --> 01:14:10.315
and you start listening to me,
your board-certified
psychiatrist,

01:14:10.358 --> 01:14:12.709
you'’re gonna find
that these symptoms
are completely treatable.

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:17.453
Except for the fact
that this is no delusion.

01:14:17.496 --> 01:14:19.629
I know you can'’t wrap
your little brain around it,

01:14:19.672 --> 01:14:21.848
but there are witches
in this world,

01:14:21.892 --> 01:14:24.938
and stuff like black magic
and fucking demons
sent to kill me.

01:14:24.982 --> 01:14:26.766
You'’re not dead yet,
Jonathan.

01:14:28.289 --> 01:14:30.335
Look, Jonathan,
the only way that
you'’re gonna get out of here

01:14:30.378 --> 01:14:32.293
is if you stop running

01:14:32.337 --> 01:14:35.079
and you start facing
your problems head-on.

01:14:35.122 --> 01:14:37.429
Next time this entity
attacks you,

01:14:37.995 --> 01:14:39.475
don'’t move.

01:14:39.518 --> 01:14:41.520
See what happens
when it approaches.

01:14:41.564 --> 01:14:44.175
You'’ll realize it's not real.
It just feels real.

01:14:44.218 --> 01:14:45.698
Do you understand me?

01:14:46.656 --> 01:14:47.700
I'’m gonna die in here.

01:14:48.527 --> 01:14:49.572
It'’s gonna be your fault.

01:14:56.927 --> 01:14:58.319
[woman crying]

01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:06.676
[weeping]

01:15:32.179 --> 01:15:35.008
-[door opens]
-[woman screaming]

01:15:37.228 --> 01:15:38.534
[door shuts]

01:16:00.381 --> 01:16:02.645
[Melinda, echoing]
Don'’t leave the circle.

01:17:34.345 --> 01:17:35.563
Hello, Jonathan.

01:17:37.914 --> 01:17:38.915
How'’d you get in here?

01:17:39.742 --> 01:17:40.830
The same way you did.

01:17:42.832 --> 01:17:44.790
You'’re probably confused
by all the things

01:17:44.834 --> 01:17:46.836
that have been
happening to you.

01:17:46.879 --> 01:17:50.143
I'’m not confused.
I know exactly what'’s going on.

01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:52.015
Should I call the cops now?

01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:55.627
We'’ve already dealt
with the police.

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:59.544
They weren'’t interested in me,
so let'’s not waste time.

01:18:07.421 --> 01:18:09.249
You'’re not gonna get away
with this.

01:18:09.293 --> 01:18:11.512
I'’ve told everybody
what you'’re doing,

01:18:11.556 --> 01:18:12.905
what you'’ve done to Dena,

01:18:13.645 --> 01:18:15.603
what you'’ve implanted in me.

01:18:16.648 --> 01:18:18.215
They know where you live.

01:18:18.258 --> 01:18:22.175
You are not remotely capable

01:18:22.219 --> 01:18:27.093
of comprehending the gravity
of what'’s happening here.

01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:30.357
Jonathan, if you could see

01:18:30.401 --> 01:18:32.620
[voice deepens]
the doors we'’ve opened,

01:18:32.664 --> 01:18:34.710
the portals
we'’ve looked through.

01:18:36.494 --> 01:18:40.541
[normal voice] Very few people
have ever experienced
something this...

01:18:41.151 --> 01:18:42.543
this horrific.

01:18:43.719 --> 01:18:45.198
But you will, Jonathan.

01:18:46.417 --> 01:18:48.114
I'’ve got you figured out.

01:18:48.158 --> 01:18:49.507
That'’s why you haven't
got me yet.

01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:51.727
Melinda told me.
I know everything.

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:54.251
Listen to your doctors,
Jonathan.

01:18:55.034 --> 01:18:56.079
Stop running.

01:18:56.993 --> 01:18:59.299
Dena served her purpose,

01:18:59.343 --> 01:19:02.650
and now it'’s time
for you to serve yours.

01:19:03.129 --> 01:19:04.174
Embrace it.

01:19:07.394 --> 01:19:08.569
Is that a threat?

01:19:10.093 --> 01:19:13.618
Tonight is going to be special.

01:19:15.489 --> 01:19:18.710
Nurse! Yo, nurse! Help!

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:20.146
This guy'’s a murderer!

01:19:20.190 --> 01:19:22.235
-He'’s here!
-[footsteps approaching]

01:19:22.279 --> 01:19:25.325
-Whoa, whoa!
Calm down, Jonathan.
-Call the cops. He'’s right here!

01:19:25.369 --> 01:19:27.458
-Calm down.
-This is the guy
who tried to kill me.

01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:29.939
-Through Dena.
-Who are you talking about?

01:19:29.982 --> 01:19:31.941
It'’s all right, buddy.
Look around. Look around.

01:19:31.984 --> 01:19:33.899
He'’s not here now.
He'’s not here now.

01:19:33.943 --> 01:19:36.206
He was just right here.

01:19:36.249 --> 01:19:37.947
All right, buddy.
It'’s okay. It's okay.

01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:40.558
There'’s no one here, all right?
There'’s no one here.

01:19:40.601 --> 01:19:42.952
-So... Hey--
-He'’s right fucking there, man.

01:19:42.995 --> 01:19:45.693
Well, he'’s not here now.
Let'’s get you back
to your room, okay?

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:54.528
I want to know
what his name is
and who let him in here.

01:19:54.572 --> 01:19:56.704
This is bullshit,
letting him fuck with me
like that in here.

01:19:56.748 --> 01:19:58.271
I will check the registry
for you,

01:19:58.315 --> 01:20:00.317
but you gotta
calm down, dude. Relax.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.536
You'’ve been doing good.
Don'’t start going backwards.

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:04.756
He said tonight
was gonna be special.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.542
-That'’s a threat.
That'’s a goddamn threat.
-Hey. Watch your mouth.

01:20:08.586 --> 01:20:10.936
You know what happens
when you talk like that
around here.

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.546
Doesn'’t matter, Wally.

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:13.896
I'’m getting the fuck
out of here tonight.

01:21:22.529 --> 01:21:23.835
[Wally]
Hey, a little help now.

01:21:29.188 --> 01:21:30.581
-Thanks.
-[woman] What'’d you get?

01:21:35.325 --> 01:21:36.674
Hey, where do you think
you'’re going?

01:21:36.717 --> 01:21:38.981
Jonathan!
[grunting]

01:21:39.024 --> 01:21:41.157
[overlapping chatter]

01:21:42.245 --> 01:21:44.029
[all shouting]

01:21:44.073 --> 01:21:45.770
[voices echoing]

01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:11.665
[man] Stop!

01:22:16.018 --> 01:22:17.193
[tires screech]

01:22:22.459 --> 01:22:23.503
[grunting]

01:22:23.547 --> 01:22:24.635
Jonathan, settle down.

01:22:26.332 --> 01:22:28.247
Someone grab the Haldol.

01:22:28.291 --> 01:22:29.727
[grunting]

01:22:33.035 --> 01:22:35.124
Okay. Okay.
I'’m good. Please.

01:22:36.168 --> 01:22:38.823
Please. Please don'’t.
I'’m sorry. I'm sorry.

01:22:40.825 --> 01:22:42.870
[hyperventilating]

01:22:46.483 --> 01:22:50.704
[sounds fade]

01:23:06.155 --> 01:23:09.114
It'’s gonna be so nice
to have you back home,
just where you belong.

01:23:11.769 --> 01:23:12.988
You have my blessing.

01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:17.514
Say it, Jonathan.

01:23:18.254 --> 01:23:20.256
Say, "I want this to happen."

01:23:21.126 --> 01:23:22.736
[gasping]

01:23:24.912 --> 01:23:26.349
Do you know
why your mom is crying?

01:23:28.612 --> 01:23:30.831
'’Cause she thinks
you'’re gonna kill yourself.

01:23:32.442 --> 01:23:33.530
That'’s why you're in here.

01:23:35.053 --> 01:23:36.794
This is your last stop, Jon.

01:23:36.837 --> 01:23:37.925
No. Come on.

01:23:41.277 --> 01:23:42.669
[voices whispering]

[shaky breathing]

01:24:23.884 --> 01:24:24.929
Relax.

01:24:27.149 --> 01:24:28.193
Just relax.
