00:44.837 --> 00:47.548
Get away! Shoo!

00:48.924 --> 00:50.968
Get away. Shoo!

02:01.622 --> 02:04.499
RBP to field base, come in.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.628
Field base, come in, please.

02:10.339 --> 02:15.219
This is Dr Robert Torrence
with the Biodiversity Project...

02:16.345 --> 02:20.098
...requesting immediate evacuation
from Sector Z15.

02:21.808 --> 02:26.063
This is a medical emergency. Please respond.

02:27.940 --> 02:33.654
I repeat: Dr Robert Torrence,
Biodiversity Project.

02:34.238 --> 02:38.116
Immediate evacuation from Sector Z15.

02:43.622 --> 02:46.250
<i>Esperen un momento. ¿ Oyeron eso?</i>

02:48.252 --> 02:50.712
<i>- Vamos. Síganme.
- Adelante.</i>

03:08.856 --> 03:10.941
<i>¿ Qué es?</i>

03:13.110 --> 03:15.028
<i>¿Está vivo?</i>

Episode 22 - F. Emasculata

04:42.824 --> 04:46.119
Hey, Bobby! You got some mail.

04:46.662 --> 04:50.541
Don't waste my time, Winston.
Both of us know I ain't got nobody.

04:50.624 --> 04:55.629
Could be those Baptists from Annandale.
I hear they've been sending fruitcake.

05:30.747 --> 05:36.503
Hey, Winston! You think this is funny?
What kind of crap you tryin' to pull here?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.798
Get this thing out of my crib!

05:39.882 --> 05:41.341
Winston!

05:41.967 --> 05:43.427
Winston!

05:44.094 --> 05:45.554
Winston!

05:46.013 --> 05:47.973
Winston!

06:12.497 --> 06:15.584
- When was he exposed?
- 18 hours ago.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.547
It incubated so quickly.

06:20.631 --> 06:24.426
Where's the prison doc?
I wanna see the prison doc.

06:25.469 --> 06:28.013
We're specialists, Mr Torrence.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.557
What's wrong with me?

06:34.186 --> 06:37.147
Five centimetres. They appear fairly uniform.

06:37.231 --> 06:40.150
- Basal temperature?
- 103.5.

06:40.234 --> 06:43.612
Oxygen saturation: 81 per cent.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.866
- What's wrong with me?
- Try and relax, Mr Torrence.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.078
We're here to help you.

07:03.507 --> 07:07.719
Put the sheets in the cart.
Make sure and get all them pillows, too.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.305
I'll be back in five minutes.

07:11.974 --> 07:14.059
We'll be here.

07:16.186 --> 07:20.440
See that? Like he couldn't
clear out of here fast enough.

07:20.524 --> 07:25.821
- The whole cell block's empty.
- McGuire says they're full up at the infirmary.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.782
- Bringing in more beds.
- Yeah, well...

07:28.866 --> 07:31.827
...it's probably something going around.

07:32.870 --> 07:36.331
- Maybe.
- What? You know somethin'?

07:37.624 --> 07:41.044
I know those sheets
ain't going to the laundry.

07:41.128 --> 07:45.215
McGuire says they're going
to some kind of incinerator.

07:46.884 --> 07:49.845
But the laundry pick-up's still happening.

07:53.390 --> 07:57.311
According to my briefing, the prisoners
escaped by hiding in a laundry cart.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.938
The guards don't watch
enough prison movies.

08:00.022 --> 08:02.274
And they're both serving life terms.

08:02.357 --> 08:05.652
- Murder convictions.
- Everybody's here.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.621
- I thought this was about escaped prisoners.
- It is.

08:15.704 --> 08:18.207
Then who are the men in the funny suits?

08:20.167 --> 08:24.129
I don't know.
It looks like some kind of decon situation.

08:25.631 --> 08:28.467
FBI running out of
crooked politicians to sting?

08:28.550 --> 08:31.303
Excuse me?

08:31.386 --> 08:33.388
Mulder and, uh, Scully?

08:33.472 --> 08:37.643
That's right. We have orders to work with
the federal marshals on this manhunt.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.938
Either of you two ever run
an escaped-convict operation?

08:41.020 --> 08:41.855
No.

08:41.938 --> 08:45.150
Then you'd be a big help
if you just try to stay out of the way.

08:45.234 --> 08:50.322
Well, we'd be happy to, as soon as
we can talk to someone who's in charge.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.491
- I'm in charge.
- Apparently not.

08:52.574 --> 08:55.285
Or you'd know why
our involvement was requested.

08:55.369 --> 08:58.121
We don't know why we're here.
If we saw the warden...

08:58.205 --> 09:01.250
No one's here. It's been taken over
by the National Guard.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.794
- They've closed off most of the facility.
- Why?

09:03.877 --> 09:06.839
I don't know. A federal marshal's
business isn't in here.

09:06.922 --> 09:10.259
It's out there trying
to catch those two convicts.

09:13.262 --> 09:17.808
- Where did this case originate, Scully?
- It came out of Skinner's office.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.978
- Did he say why he gave it to us?
- No. Why?

09:21.061 --> 09:24.648
Well, this isn't the type of thing
the FBI normally gets called in on.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.651
I got a feeling we're not
being told the entire story.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.070
I've got the same feeling, Mulder.

09:31.446 --> 09:35.117
- You think you can find out what's going on?
- I can try.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.704
- Where are you going?
- To see if I can get in the way.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.719
Hey, you girls go with Mom.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.888
I'll see you in a minute.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.249
Robert?

10:24.833 --> 10:27.127
Robert?

10:27.920 --> 10:30.088
Robert!

10:30.339 --> 10:31.757
Whooo-whooo!

10:31.840 --> 10:34.551
Hey! Robert?

10:34.635 --> 10:37.137
- Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
- Hey! Hey!

10:39.264 --> 10:42.976
- I'm sorry. This is a restricted area.
- Who are you?

10:43.060 --> 10:45.562
- Dr Osborne.
- Are you the prison doctor?

10:45.646 --> 10:48.649
- No.
- Who do you work for?

10:48.732 --> 10:50.692
The CDC.

10:50.776 --> 10:55.572
You work for the Centers for Disease Control.
What are you doing here?

10:55.656 --> 11:00.911
Sir? I'm a medical doctor.
I wanna know what's going on here.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.873
If you don't let me in, a lot of people
in Washington are gonna find out...

11:04.957 --> 11:08.710
...that you're conducting
a secret quarantine in here.

11:13.799 --> 11:16.927
- I'm under strict orders.
- So am I.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.722
There is a flu-like illness
spreading amongst the prisoners.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.392
- How many people are infected?
- 14 men so far.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.353
- Any deaths?
- 10... of the 14.

11:28.188 --> 11:32.109
What are the chances
the men who escaped are infected?

11:43.287 --> 11:46.957
They just took off. Can you believe that?

11:47.875 --> 11:50.252
- Mulder.
- Mulder, it's me.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.838
I'm starting to get a picture
of what's going on.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.924
- What did you find?
- There's a deadly contagion...

11:56.008 --> 11:59.595
...sweeping the lockdown population.
- Deadly?

11:59.678 --> 12:02.264
How deadly?

12:02.347 --> 12:07.686
Well, from what I've seen so far...
36 hours after infection deadly.

12:09.521 --> 12:12.316
Is there a chance any of
the escaped men were infected?

12:12.399 --> 12:14.860
The exact nature of this thing is unclear.

12:14.943 --> 12:19.114
So is their exposure to it
and any danger they might pose.

12:19.198 --> 12:22.701
- I'd say these guys are a danger in any event.
- Let's get him out.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.245
Call me as soon as you know anything.

12:26.496 --> 12:29.541
I don't care who you are.
I want you out of here right now.

12:29.625 --> 12:33.337
- Not until I get answers.
- You're in violation of federal statutes.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.423
- I'm a federal agent, sir.
- Who were you on the phone to?

12:36.507 --> 12:39.718
My partner. He needs to know
if the escaped men are infected.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.678
That information is unavailable.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.973
Then I wanna see charts
and I want access to the infirmary.

12:45.057 --> 12:47.559
You see what I let you see.

13:38.110 --> 13:40.112
Hello?

13:40.195 --> 13:42.364
I'm free, baby.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.783
- Paul?
- Listen. I'm gonna...

13:44.867 --> 13:48.036
- Where are you?
- I'm coming home.

13:48.704 --> 13:52.249
- What are you talking about?
- I'm coming to get ya.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.794
What? What?

14:06.638 --> 14:08.724
Yo! Anybody in here?

14:19.818 --> 14:21.904
Hello?

14:30.954 --> 14:33.665
Hey, man. Are you OK?

14:38.045 --> 14:40.547
You look messed up.

14:43.467 --> 14:45.552
Hey, man...

15:29.847 --> 15:31.932
You can't be down here.

15:32.015 --> 15:36.770
I need to know what they're dying from. You
said this was some kind of a flu-like illness.

15:36.854 --> 15:39.481
- What are these?
- The bodies should not be exposed.

15:39.565 --> 15:44.236
Do all of the victims have these boils?
You're burning the bodies. Why?

15:54.746 --> 15:56.832
Dr Osborne, wait!

16:47.674 --> 16:51.220
Freeze! Hands in the air! Freeze!

16:52.471 --> 16:53.805
Freeze!

16:53.889 --> 16:55.974
Clear!

16:56.517 --> 16:58.894
We got a man down!

16:58.977 --> 17:01.313
He's alive!

17:04.983 --> 17:08.862
Attendant is Angelo Garza. He took
a crack to the head, but he's talking.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.571
Lucky they didn't kill him.

17:10.656 --> 17:13.450
Kid's got a lot of hair.
Probably absorbed the blow.

17:13.534 --> 17:17.496
He found one of the men in pain on
the bathroom floor with a boil on his face.

17:17.579 --> 17:21.124
There's a contagion at the prison.
These men could be infected.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.836
Get on the horn.
See what anybody knows about that.

17:23.919 --> 17:27.673
They took the kid's keys and got in the safe.
They got money, a car...

17:27.756 --> 17:30.509
...possibly a firearm,
and they got a big head start.

17:30.592 --> 17:35.472
- Any idea where they're headed?
- 23 possible roads and thoroughfares.

17:35.722 --> 17:40.102
- Either of them got a girlfriend?
- Those records are locked up in the prison.

17:40.185 --> 17:45.858
- For now, this is Smokey and the Bandit.
- If they did, they probably tried to call them.

17:45.941 --> 17:48.235
Did you think of that?

17:56.368 --> 17:58.912
This is the operator. How may I help you?

17:59.037 --> 18:02.291
I'm a federal agent assisting
in a manhunt for two prisoners.

18:02.374 --> 18:11.133
My badge number is: JTT047101111. I need to
know the last call made from this booth.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.677
All right, sir. One moment, please.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.555
That number is 555-6936.

18:16.638 --> 18:20.559
- Can you repeat that, please?
- 555-6936.

18:20.726 --> 18:22.811
All right, thank you.

18:36.283 --> 18:40.746
What's going on here? Hey!
What are you guys doing here?

18:40.829 --> 18:44.041
Hey, what the hell's going on here?
Who authorised this?

18:44.124 --> 18:48.003
- Are you gonna do anything about this?
- What's going on? What's going on?!

18:48.086 --> 18:50.380
Where are they taking me?

18:55.636 --> 18:57.763
Who are you?

19:05.229 --> 19:07.606
- Hey, did you order this?
- No.

19:07.689 --> 19:10.901
- Then who the hell did?
- I don't know. There was a call made...

19:10.984 --> 19:15.781
...from that booth two hours ago. I got an
address and number for Dinwiddie County.

19:25.457 --> 19:28.752
Wait here, sweetie. I'll be right back.

19:28.836 --> 19:32.923
- I thought you were BS-ing me.
- I'm gone, sweet thing.

19:35.801 --> 19:38.887
- They ain't never takin' me back.
- I ain't gonna let them.

19:38.971 --> 19:42.391
- Mommy! Mommy!
- I'm coming, sweetie.

19:42.474 --> 19:45.102
Daddy's home. Come on.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.688
- I got somebody with me.
- What?

19:53.986 --> 19:56.613
What's wrong with him?

19:56.697 --> 19:59.575
I don't know. He's out of it.

19:59.658 --> 20:03.370
- Oh, hell. He's burning up.
- We gotta get him in the house.

20:05.873 --> 20:07.666
Can I help you?

20:07.749 --> 20:11.336
Yes. I'm trying to trace the origin
of a package that was sent to...

20:11.420 --> 20:15.799
...a Robert Torrence at the Cumberland State
Correctional Facility in Virginia.

20:15.883 --> 20:22.264
- Do you have the package ID number?
- Yeah, the package ID number is DDP112148.

20:23.140 --> 20:25.225
Sure, I'll hold.

20:26.935 --> 20:29.688
Are you there?
It was sent from Wichita, Kansas.

20:29.771 --> 20:34.401
The package was sent from Wichita, Kansas?
Did you record the name of the sender?

20:34.484 --> 20:38.405
It says here it was sent
from Pinck Pharmaceuticals.

20:38.488 --> 20:42.326
- Could you check that again, please?
- Sure.

20:42.409 --> 20:45.495
- Yes, ma'am. That's what it says.
- Thank you.

20:55.589 --> 20:56.715
Yeah?

20:56.798 --> 20:59.718
What do you know about
Pinck Pharmaceuticals?

20:59.801 --> 21:04.389
It's one of, if not the biggest,
manufacturer of drugs in America. Why?

21:04.932 --> 21:09.436
They sent a package to a prisoner who may
have been the first victim of the contagion.

21:09.520 --> 21:13.148
- Any idea what was in the package?
- No. It's empty.

21:15.275 --> 21:20.656
From the description, one prisoner had
a large, purplish inflammation on his face.

21:20.739 --> 21:24.993
That sounds like what I'm finding
on all the victims in here.

21:25.077 --> 21:29.748
- Do you know what that means, Mulder?
- It could spread. I need to know more.

21:29.831 --> 21:32.334
- How it's transmitted.
- I'm on it.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.830
Gotta go. Gotta keep movin'.

22:09.913 --> 22:13.292
Paul! Paul, he's awake.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.919
Paul, come here!

22:16.003 --> 22:19.590
You gotta help me. I'm... I'm burning up here.

22:19.673 --> 22:21.758
Please.

22:24.636 --> 22:26.513
Paul!

22:39.735 --> 22:41.403
Paul! Paul!

22:42.029 --> 22:44.948
Paul!

22:52.414 --> 22:56.752
We got one prisoner dead in the bedroom.
The other one's gone.

23:00.130 --> 23:03.050
Charlie, why don't you get the boy?

23:25.531 --> 23:28.075
- Come with me.
- Why? What's going on?

23:28.158 --> 23:30.661
Just come with me.

23:35.832 --> 23:38.335
What the hell is going on?

23:40.587 --> 23:43.090
I've been infected.

23:44.258 --> 23:47.803
They're not letting me out.
The entire prison's been quarantined.

23:47.886 --> 23:52.182
- By who? The CDC?
- The CDC has nothing to do with this.

23:53.976 --> 23:57.729
It's the company. They're behind everything.

23:57.813 --> 24:02.818
Pinck Pharmaceuticals.
You work for Pinck Pharmaceuticals?

24:04.027 --> 24:06.113
How did this happen?

24:07.114 --> 24:10.409
We finance exploration of
new species from the rainforest...

24:10.492 --> 24:13.245
...with potential drug applications.

24:13.328 --> 24:17.249
Three months ago, a field entomologist
disappeared in Costa Rica.

24:17.332 --> 24:20.085
- Disappeared how?
- We're not sure.

24:20.169 --> 24:22.880
He just sent us some samples of an insect.

24:24.006 --> 24:28.051
Like this? I found this buried
in one of the dead prisoners.

24:28.802 --> 24:31.305
Faciphaga emasculata.

24:32.764 --> 24:36.602
We were interested in it because
of a dilating enzyme it secretes.

24:36.685 --> 24:39.062
Is this what caused the outbreak?

24:39.146 --> 24:41.231
No. No, not precisely.

24:41.690 --> 24:46.778
F. emasculata is a parasitoid -
a bug that carries a parasite.

24:46.862 --> 24:51.658
In this case, a deadly parasite
that attacks the immune system.

24:51.742 --> 24:55.370
The pustules are part of
the natural reproductive cycle.

24:55.454 --> 24:59.291
They're full of the larvae that
you see there on the scope.

25:01.251 --> 25:04.755
So the contagion only spreads
when the pustules erupt.

25:04.838 --> 25:09.009
And the larvae that are expelled
burrow into the new host.

25:09.092 --> 25:14.431
Agent Scully... you were there
when the pustule erupted on me.

25:15.849 --> 25:18.644
Which means you may also be infected.

25:30.447 --> 25:32.616
Come in.

25:32.699 --> 25:35.744
- Thank you for seeing me at this late hour.
- What is it?

25:35.827 --> 25:40.040
This case we've been assigned. I believe
we've been misled. Possibly deceived.

25:40.123 --> 25:44.211
- Deceived? By whom?
- Whoever originated the case.

25:44.294 --> 25:47.214
What is the accusation, Agent Mulder?

25:53.428 --> 25:58.851
That we were sent on this manhunt without
knowledge of the existence of the contagion.

25:58.934 --> 26:04.773
- What is the exact nature of the contagion?
- It's deadly. It kills within 36 hours.

26:04.857 --> 26:07.776
One escaped convict was infected -
he's dead now.

26:07.860 --> 26:10.487
The other man may be infected
and he's on the loose.

26:10.571 --> 26:13.991
Does anyone know whether
it's a virus or a bacteria?

26:14.074 --> 26:18.245
We know that over a dozen men have died
from it. It appears to be highly contagious.

26:18.328 --> 26:21.498
- Then you don't know much.
- Why weren't we told the truth?

26:21.582 --> 26:24.918
We didn't know the truth. What we knew
would have slowed you down.

26:25.002 --> 26:28.547
Innocent people could be infected.
You could have prevented that.

26:28.630 --> 26:35.179
How? In 1988 there was an outbreak
of haemorrhagic fever in Sacramento.

26:35.262 --> 26:39.641
The truth would have caused panic.
Panic would have cost lives.

26:39.725 --> 26:44.479
- We controlled it by controlling information.
- You can't protect the public by lying.

26:44.563 --> 26:46.732
It's done every day.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.901
I won't be a party to it.

26:51.737 --> 26:54.323
How about you?

26:54.698 --> 26:57.201
You're a party to it already.

26:58.327 --> 27:02.372
How many people are being infected
while you stand here not doing your job?

27:02.456 --> 27:07.419
Ten? Twenty?
What's the truth, Agent Mulder?

27:41.286 --> 27:45.332
- Mulder.
- Mulder, they're enforcing a full quarantine.

27:46.375 --> 27:47.209
What?

27:47.292 --> 27:50.546
One of the epidemiologists
who claimed to be with the CDC...

27:50.629 --> 27:52.965
...told me that this was no accident.

27:53.048 --> 27:56.385
Pinck Pharmaceutical is here
trying to clean it up quietly.

27:56.468 --> 28:00.180
- And the government would have to know.
- Do you have proof of that?

28:00.264 --> 28:05.227
Why else would the National Guard be here?
They're protecting Pinck Pharmaceutical.

28:05.310 --> 28:09.898
I need to know how this happened. Document
everything you can get your hands on.

28:09.982 --> 28:12.901
- People have to know about the cover-up.
- The public?

28:12.985 --> 28:17.364
- It's a public-health crisis.
- We can't leak this. Not until we know more.

28:17.447 --> 28:20.784
The fugitive you're looking for
might not even be infected.

28:20.868 --> 28:23.036
- What if he is?
- If this gets out...

28:23.120 --> 28:28.208
...the panic is gonna spread faster than
the contagion. We can't let this be known.

28:28.292 --> 28:31.003
What if someone dies
because we withheld what we knew?

28:31.086 --> 28:34.298
What if someone dies because we didn't?

28:34.381 --> 28:38.802
There'll be a time for the truth,
Mulder, but this isn't it.

28:42.347 --> 28:44.850
Are you OK in there, Scully?

28:45.267 --> 28:51.023
Yeah. I'm OK. All I want you to
worry about is capturing that fugitive.

28:51.523 --> 28:54.026
Take care of yourself, Mulder.

29:16.840 --> 29:20.844
If you're not infected,
you should leave immediately.

29:20.928 --> 29:23.013
And if I am?

29:26.475 --> 29:29.311
The parasite is undetectable
in the bloodstream.

29:29.394 --> 29:33.941
This is the only way to test
whether or not you've been infected.

29:34.942 --> 29:38.403
These uninfected insects act as incubators.

29:41.365 --> 29:43.992
Now the insect's bite won't infect you.

29:44.076 --> 29:48.664
The contagion can only be contracted
through exposure to the larvae.

29:49.915 --> 29:52.000
How long will this take?

29:52.835 --> 29:56.296
Thirty minutes. Then another two hours...

29:56.380 --> 30:00.133
...before the parasite reproduces
enough for us to see it.

30:15.607 --> 30:19.736
Elizabeth? My name is Fox Mulder.
I'm with the FBI.

30:21.488 --> 30:25.409
- Where did Paul go, Elizabeth?
- I don't know.

30:28.370 --> 30:30.455
I think you do know.

30:32.207 --> 30:35.127
And I think you know why you're in here.

30:36.920 --> 30:40.007
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine.

30:41.466 --> 30:46.388
Steve felt fine too.
It didn't take long for that to change.

30:46.471 --> 30:49.808
- You're just tryin' to scare me.
- You should be scared.

30:49.892 --> 30:52.144
- If I were you, I'd be scared.
- You're lyin'!

30:52.227 --> 30:56.481
Paul is the one who was lying. And if
he's infected, a lot of people are gonna die.

30:56.565 --> 31:02.654
If that's true, how come it's not on TV?
How come they're not tellin' everybody?

31:02.738 --> 31:06.408
- That's not my decision.
- Well, whose decision is it?

31:06.491 --> 31:10.162
You knew about it
and you didn't say anything.

31:10.245 --> 31:13.040
Why should I tell the truth if you won't?

31:13.123 --> 31:17.503
Elizabeth, Paul is out there somewhere.
I have to find him.

31:19.254 --> 31:21.340
Now you can help me...

31:22.466 --> 31:24.551
...or not.

31:27.679 --> 31:30.807
Ten o'clock bus to Toronto.
She was supposed to be with him.

31:30.891 --> 31:33.477
That bus depot's over a half-hour from here.

31:33.560 --> 31:37.147
- Get on to the local PD.
- They don't know what they're dealing with.

31:37.231 --> 31:41.610
If he's infected, he could spread it.
What we need now is control.

31:47.866 --> 31:49.993
Toronto, one way?

31:50.077 --> 31:51.453
Yes.

32:15.018 --> 32:19.648
Now... once we harvest
the blood from the insect...

32:32.744 --> 32:38.166
The toxins... they're moving into my brain
just like it did on the prisoners.

32:38.250 --> 32:41.044
I don't have much longer.

32:41.128 --> 32:43.297
I need you to help me.

32:43.380 --> 32:45.465
What do you want me to do?

32:50.179 --> 32:52.347
Go on.

32:52.431 --> 32:54.933
You have to complete the test.

32:56.935 --> 32:59.146
Why did you confide in me?

33:00.814 --> 33:04.651
It's not a secret I feel like taking to the grave.

33:04.735 --> 33:08.572
People have a right to know
the danger we put them in.

33:09.907 --> 33:14.745
If your test comes back negative...
you have to tell them.

33:16.246 --> 33:19.041
How can I prove it?

33:19.124 --> 33:21.835
I don't know.

33:21.919 --> 33:25.547
But if you don't, it'll just happen again.

33:28.425 --> 33:33.931
Don't believe for a second
that this is an isolated incident.

34:43.876 --> 34:47.337
Your attention, please.
Bus number 953...

34:48.505 --> 34:51.132
- Wait a second.
- I don't wanna miss the bus.

34:54.969 --> 34:59.266
You see that? They're still loading
the luggage. You're not missing anything.

34:59.349 --> 35:03.145
You have enough time to give
your mother a kiss goodbye.

35:07.816 --> 35:09.902
Ticket.

35:11.278 --> 35:13.989
Be careful. Say hi to Uncle Jay.

35:19.578 --> 35:21.663
Hey!

35:22.247 --> 35:24.333
What's the time?

35:27.252 --> 35:29.338
Twenty to ten.

35:49.650 --> 35:53.237
- What are you doing?
- This material will be destroyed...

35:53.320 --> 35:56.532
...according to standard CDC procedure.

35:56.615 --> 35:59.493
You don't work for the CDC.

35:59.576 --> 36:01.662
Where's Dr Osborne?

36:13.298 --> 36:16.927
- He told me what happened here.
- What happened here was unavoidable.

36:17.010 --> 36:21.515
- We'll leave that up to others to decide.
- Dr Osborne is dead.

36:21.598 --> 36:25.143
No one in this room
will corroborate your story.

36:25.227 --> 36:28.605
Just be glad this thing is under control.

36:48.500 --> 36:54.047
Would the driver of bus number 25
to Pittsburgh come to the dispatch office?

37:09.688 --> 37:13.942
Your attention, please.
Announcing the arrival of bus number 126...

37:23.660 --> 37:27.331
- He's here. He bought a ticket to Toronto.
- Son of a bitch.

37:27.414 --> 37:29.917
And he's infected.

37:33.837 --> 37:35.923
- Mulder.
- Mulder...

37:36.006 --> 37:38.926
...I think everything here is under control.

37:39.009 --> 37:41.386
- You OK, Scully?
- Yeah.

37:41.720 --> 37:45.307
- Have you found the second prisoner?
- Yeah. He's headed to Toronto.

37:45.390 --> 37:50.896
He's alive? Mulder, listen to me.
Everything here has been destroyed.

37:50.979 --> 37:54.441
Any evidence whatsoever
of a cover-up has been incinerated.

37:54.525 --> 37:58.570
That prisoner is the last man who could
possibly connect the conspirators.

37:58.654 --> 38:01.740
- He's infected. He's gonna die.
- If you want the truth...

38:01.823 --> 38:04.743
...he's gonna have to make a statement.

38:35.148 --> 38:39.820
- Hold your men back. I'm getting on the bus.
- We've got the situation controlled.

38:39.903 --> 38:44.074
- That bus isn't going anywhere.
- The prisoner sees a uniform, he could panic.

38:44.157 --> 38:46.660
He panics, and innocent people die.

38:47.452 --> 38:50.497
- What you do wanna do?
- I take the seat behind the prisoner.

38:50.581 --> 38:54.585
I put my gun to his head.
I make an announcement to clear the bus.

38:59.631 --> 39:01.633
Thank you.

39:09.391 --> 39:12.311
Can you take your seat, sir?

39:12.394 --> 39:15.981
- There's supposed to be a man on the bus.
- I've got a schedule to keep.

39:16.064 --> 39:20.319
Now please, take your seat,
or I'm gonna have to ask you to get off.

39:22.863 --> 39:27.201
Take the key out of the ignition
and turn around slowly.

39:27.284 --> 39:30.287
- What is this?
- I'm with the FBI.

39:30.370 --> 39:33.999
I need to know if this man
has boarded the bus.

39:34.917 --> 39:37.002
Yeah.

39:42.466 --> 39:44.635
That's him, right back there.

39:49.264 --> 39:52.559
Federal agent! Drop your weapon!

39:59.066 --> 40:01.151
Plan A has gone to hell. Get ready.

40:01.235 --> 40:03.153
- Let the boy go!
- Move the damn bus!

40:03.237 --> 40:08.575
You got over two dozen US marshals out
there, Paul. How far are you gonna get?

40:20.420 --> 40:22.506
I'm dying, ain't I?

40:22.589 --> 40:26.510
The question is, how many people
are you gonna take with you?

40:26.593 --> 40:29.930
- What is this thing?
- You were infected in prison.

40:33.225 --> 40:37.604
- It's what Bobby Torrence had.
- And your girlfriend, Elizabeth.

40:37.688 --> 40:40.399
And possibly your son.

40:40.482 --> 40:43.402
How many more people
do you want to expose?

40:44.695 --> 40:48.949
It came from that package
in Bobby's cell, didn't it?

40:49.032 --> 40:51.535
You saw a package?

40:52.744 --> 40:55.247
What the hell was it?

41:02.671 --> 41:05.174
All right, everybody off the bus.

41:06.425 --> 41:09.887
Just keep going. Just go. Just go.

41:11.263 --> 41:13.348
Keep moving.

41:14.850 --> 41:18.145
All right, come on out. It's OK.

41:19.021 --> 41:21.940
Come on, just slide out. I'm here for you.

41:22.024 --> 41:24.109
That's it. Come on.

41:26.320 --> 41:28.405
All right.

41:33.327 --> 41:36.496
All right, Paul. What was in that package?

41:36.580 --> 41:43.045
What was in that package? A pharmaceutical
company was using you as a guinea pig.

41:43.128 --> 41:47.758
If you tell me what was in that package,
I'll make sure they don't get away with it.

41:47.841 --> 41:51.178
Come on, Paul. You remember. Tell me!

41:55.557 --> 41:59.019
Get him off the bus.
Get him outta there.

42:02.147 --> 42:04.775
You have to get off. Let's go.

42:04.858 --> 42:07.319
Get off.

42:15.536 --> 42:19.706
Robert Torrence was patient zero -
the first prisoner to contract the disease.

42:19.790 --> 42:24.169
Before going to the infirmary, he received
a package from Pinck Pharmaceuticals.

42:24.253 --> 42:27.464
They orchestrated this
to circumvent years of FDA trials...

42:27.548 --> 42:30.926
...to get their drug on the market.
- Why are you telling me this?

42:31.009 --> 42:34.054
I wanted you to hear from me
before you read it in the papers.

42:34.137 --> 42:37.391
I'd seriously reconsider
bringing this to the media.

42:37.474 --> 42:40.102
The public should know,
so it doesn't happen again.

42:40.185 --> 42:44.147
You're gonna prove this conspiracy
with an empty package and a dead insect?

42:44.231 --> 42:47.985
- Leave it alone. The epidemic was contained.
- 18 people are dead.

42:48.068 --> 42:53.198
And if you're helping them cover the truth,
you're just as guilty as they are.

42:54.366 --> 42:57.411
You really have no idea
who you're dealing with, do you?

42:57.494 --> 43:00.330
I thought I was dealing with you.

43:05.252 --> 43:09.089
- We can't prove a thing. They've made sure.
- What are you talking about?

43:09.173 --> 43:12.968
The Costa Rican government faxed me
the report on the missing scientist.

43:13.051 --> 43:16.221
His name was Robert Torrence,
the same as our prisoner.

43:16.305 --> 43:21.143
It was their fail-safe in case it came to this.
They could blame it on a simple postal error.

43:21.226 --> 43:23.312
A mistake.

43:24.980 --> 43:27.065
Hmm.

43:27.733 --> 43:32.571
That's why we were given this assignment,
right? They knew all along.

43:33.280 --> 43:38.869
So that even if we succeeded in finding
the truth, we'd be discredited as part of it.

43:39.995 --> 43:42.080
Am I right?

43:43.999 --> 43:47.836
- Am I right?!
- You never had a chance, Agent Mulder.

43:47.920 --> 43:51.757
- For every step you take, they're three ahead.
- Where do you stand?

43:51.840 --> 43:55.385
I stand right on the line
that you keep crossing.

43:56.887 --> 43:58.972
Come on, let's go.

44:01.558 --> 44:03.644
Agent Mulder.

44:07.898 --> 44:10.817
I'm saying this as a friend.

44:10.901 --> 44:13.237
Watch your back.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.614
This is just the beginning.

44:31.313 --> 44:37.148
