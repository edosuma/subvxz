01:56.116 --> 01:59.661
On the <i>first day,</i>
<i>the House of Morningstar fell.</i>

02:01.830 --> 02:05.250
<i>On the third day,</i>
<i>the newly crowned King of Hell, Caliban,</i>

02:05.542 --> 02:09.295
<i>led the Infernal Armies on a crusade</i>
<i>to claim the Earth as the Tenth Circle.</i>

02:10.463 --> 02:11.589
<i>He failed.</i>

02:12.132 --> 02:15.760
<i>On the fourth day, the pagans</i>
<i>beat back Caliban and his armies.</i>

02:15.844 --> 02:17.804
<i>The Earth was theirs.</i>

02:18.680 --> 02:22.267
<i>On the 7th day,</i>
<i>Hell was emptied by an army of celestials.</i>

02:23.101 --> 02:24.853
<i>But what of Sabrina Morningstar?</i>

02:26.354 --> 02:28.439
<i>She was where Caliban had left her,</i>

02:28.523 --> 02:31.651
<i>entombed in stone</i>
<i>between her father and Lilith.</i>

02:32.318 --> 02:33.903
<i>How much time had passed?</i>

02:34.237 --> 02:35.446
<i>Decades, in fact.</i>

02:35.822 --> 02:38.950
<i>She wondered dimly,</i>
<i>who would come save her?</i>

02:39.534 --> 02:43.371
<i>Would it be Nicholas or Harvey</i>
<i>or Rosalind or her aunties?</i>

02:43.454 --> 02:45.540
<i>She didn't know they'd all died long ago.</i>

02:46.124 --> 02:50.753
<i>And that in the end, the only person</i>
<i>who could save Sabrina was herself.</i>

02:51.671 --> 02:54.048
Sabrina, you can hear me.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.176
You can open your eyes.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.511
Do you know how I know that?

02:58.595 --> 03:01.014
Because you already did it once before.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.267
You just need a little help waking up.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.519
<i>Et aperi oculos tuos.</i>

03:13.151 --> 03:14.194
Welcome back.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.070
Now we switch places.

03:17.071 --> 03:18.615
<i>Nostra versa loca.</i>

03:22.243 --> 03:23.369
Oh, my gosh.

03:24.954 --> 03:25.955
You're me!

03:26.623 --> 03:29.459
How can you be me,
and how did you save me?

03:29.542 --> 03:31.377
I haven't, not yet.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.672
But at least now you have a chance
to save yourself and everyone else.

03:34.756 --> 03:39.135
Go, collect the Unholy Regalia
and take back Greendale from the pagans.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.137
Take back? What do you mean?
What happened?

03:41.221 --> 03:42.055
There's no time.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.224
Get the Regalia, save Greendale.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.643
And when you're done,
it will be your turn.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.269
My turn to what?

03:48.353 --> 03:50.188
To be me. To do this.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.232
I'm you, Sabrina.

03:52.774 --> 03:53.858
Future you.

03:54.817 --> 03:57.946
Doesn't that mean you already know
what happens or happened?

03:58.029 --> 03:59.656
I know one version of it,

03:59.739 --> 04:02.617
but I can't say anymore
without risking a timeline catastrophe.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.494
Just remember,
when you're done with everything

04:04.577 --> 04:07.622
you have to come back to right here,
right now,

04:07.705 --> 04:10.625
and do what I just did
to complete the time loop.

04:10.708 --> 04:13.044
It's the only way
to keep the realms preserved.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.463
If you don't, it could be chaos.

04:15.546 --> 04:19.926
I feel like I say this all the time,
but I've never meant it more:

04:20.009 --> 04:21.010
I don't understand.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.763
Do you remember that old movie
Ambrose loves, <i>Back to the Future?</i>

04:24.264 --> 04:26.432
It's just like that, but with magic.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.559
Just go with it.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.855
We shouldn't be talking.
Even crossing paths is risky.

04:33.731 --> 04:37.527
Luckily, the Ninth Circle of Hell
exists in...

04:38.444 --> 04:39.988
its... own...

04:40.947 --> 04:42.907
time... pocket.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.592
The Regalia.

05:05.179 --> 05:07.390
Secret window, secret door,

05:07.473 --> 05:09.434
open wide, and show me more.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.066
Do not disturb my beloved!

05:17.150 --> 05:18.318
Oh, no.

05:19.193 --> 05:21.029
Herod, what are you doing here?

05:21.112 --> 05:24.699
We are guardians,
protecting our treasures.

05:24.782 --> 05:26.367
This is Hell. You shouldn't be here.

05:26.451 --> 05:31.039
Hell is empty, angel-witch,
and all the devils are gone.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.500
Boys, take it easy!

05:39.797 --> 05:42.759
Update: I have more power
than I did before.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.428
And empty or not, Hell is my domain.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.097
You should not be threatening me here.

05:50.808 --> 05:53.061
What happened here? Do you know?

05:53.144 --> 05:57.774
Hell was invaded by the archangel Michael,
who defeated the Clay King.

05:58.232 --> 06:00.026
The Clay King? Is that Caliban?

06:00.109 --> 06:02.153
Yes. He's dead.

06:02.236 --> 06:04.197
Pandemonium was sacked,

06:04.280 --> 06:07.033
but the Unholy Regalia remained hidden.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.284
So we came.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.788
What about Caliban's plan
to expand Hell into the mortal realm?

06:11.871 --> 06:14.707
He tried, but was beaten back
by the pagans of Earth.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.793
The pagans of Earth?

06:17.668 --> 06:19.921
Right, okay, I have to get to Earth.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.548
I am walking out of here with the Regalia,

06:22.632 --> 06:25.968
and you can either step aside
or be cut down.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.303
It's your choice.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.170
Hello?

07:48.676 --> 07:49.677
Prudence?

07:52.054 --> 07:53.347
The embalming room.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.102
Mambo.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.733
Aunt Zee.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.237
No.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.407
No.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.167
Aunt Hilda.

08:21.959 --> 08:22.960
Maybe...

08:27.507 --> 08:29.008
Aunties, I'm so sorry.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.844
I wasn't there for you...

08:33.095 --> 08:35.306
when you needed me most. I'm so sorry.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.225
<i>Spellman.</i>

09:43.791 --> 09:44.667
Hello?

09:56.929 --> 09:57.763
Hello?

10:08.524 --> 10:09.859
<i>Claudat ostia.</i>

10:24.081 --> 10:25.583
<i>Aperti ianuam.</i>

10:32.632 --> 10:34.091
What are you guys doing here?

10:34.175 --> 10:37.219
Where the Regalia goes, we follow.

11:09.001 --> 11:09.919
Wait here.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.453
The pagans.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.539
The carnival.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.506
No.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.754
Don't say a word. Come with me.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.760
I'm assuming they're with you?

13:26.555 --> 13:30.017
I don't understand, how has it been years
since I left Greendale?

13:30.100 --> 13:31.268
Decades, cousin.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.063
Time and suffering, no doubt,

13:34.146 --> 13:36.482
operate under different rules
in the Ninth Circle.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.108
It hardly matters now. It's done.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.987
But it matters to me what happened
to the rest of the coven and the mortals.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.572
They're dead, Sabrina.

13:44.114 --> 13:45.449
Everyone is dead and gone.

13:45.866 --> 13:49.036
They're trapped in flesh factories
by those plant-like creatures.

13:49.119 --> 13:51.705
Their blood is harvested
to water the Green Man.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.876
Sabrina, the pagans won.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.672
The Earth is once more
a garden of horrors.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.382
And this is the only safe place left.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.217
Why the Kinkle mines?

14:03.801 --> 14:06.178
I managed to fortify the entrance

14:06.262 --> 14:08.305
using a binding spell
to keep the pagans away.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.652
How have you survived all this time alone?

14:21.735 --> 14:24.613
I'm not going to lie,
I went a bit mad for a while,

14:25.322 --> 14:27.032
a decade or two.

14:28.200 --> 14:33.497
The books have been my salvation.
I've read, well... I've read everything.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.207
Please tell me in all your readings,

14:35.291 --> 14:37.668
you came across something
that could help us,

14:37.751 --> 14:39.879
some way for us to fix things.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.463
Fix things?

14:44.300 --> 14:46.844
Sabrina, you missed the end of the world.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.430
Our aunties are dead.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.099
Prudence is dead.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.393
She died in my arms.

14:55.269 --> 14:58.856
And with her dying breath she...
she begged me...

14:59.773 --> 15:01.483
to abandon her, to run away.

15:02.484 --> 15:03.986
Stop him.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.406
I can't. I can't leave you.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.490
And why?

15:10.075 --> 15:11.493
So that I could grab this.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.705
Father Blackwood's time egg,
and hide it from him.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.002
Ambrose, I'm so, so sorry.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.086
Where were you?

15:22.129 --> 15:23.839
You should have been with us.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.049
With your family.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.967
You were the one who told me
to stay in Hell

15:27.051 --> 15:28.719
and fight to win the Unholy Regalia.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.180
Did you... did you win, at least?

15:31.263 --> 15:35.392
Yeah, I got them, the three items, but...
what does it matter if the battle's over,

15:35.476 --> 15:37.853
if we already lost
and there's no hope of--

15:40.606 --> 15:41.523
Wait a minute.

15:42.858 --> 15:45.986
Of course. That's how it was me.

15:46.695 --> 15:50.824
Ambrose, can the egg's magicks be used
to send someone backwards through time?

15:52.326 --> 15:57.748
Perhaps, but the level of magical energies
required to do that--

15:57.831 --> 16:01.293
Would be equal to those imbued
in the items of the Unholy Regalia?

16:01.377 --> 16:02.962
No, no, that would never work.

16:03.045 --> 16:06.256
-That's too dangerous!
-It will work. It <i>did </i>work.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.425
Don't ask me how I know. Just trust me.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.635
We can do this.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.804
You and me, the last Spellmans.

16:11.887 --> 16:15.474
We could stop the pagans,
save our aunties, save all of Greendale.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.600
We have to!

16:17.226 --> 16:19.395
We'd have to re-purpose
the Unholy Regalia.

16:19.478 --> 16:22.564
That is, if...
if they're all right with that.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.358
Of course, they know.

16:24.441 --> 16:26.527
This is what they've been guarding
the Regalia for,

16:26.610 --> 16:29.780
to be used in this exact way
at this precise moment in time.

16:29.863 --> 16:31.991
You feel that in your bones, don't you?

16:36.120 --> 16:37.162
Okay, then.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.624
Then we need to...

16:40.708 --> 16:43.961
we need to smelt down those items
into a weapon of sorts.

16:44.044 --> 16:47.756
- What kind of weapon?
- Ironically enough...

16:49.049 --> 16:51.969
a morning star,
a medieval spiked ball and chain

16:52.052 --> 16:55.305
that you'll use to gather
the egg's magical energies into a vortex.

16:55.389 --> 16:59.601
We just need a sacred place
to do this, like... like... um...

17:00.394 --> 17:02.104
Oh, sweet Satan,

17:03.272 --> 17:05.357
like the stone circle at the Academy.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.901
Right, okay, so what's the problem?

17:07.985 --> 17:10.612
Well, the Academy is where
Blackwood now holds court,

17:10.696 --> 17:15.701
driven mad and feral by his insane worship
of those eldritch terrors he prays to.

17:17.161 --> 17:20.414
And even with your infernal guardsmen,
Blackwood bears the mark of Cain,

17:20.497 --> 17:22.082
which means he is unkillable.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.959
Then we won't even try to kill him.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.336
Get it all ready, Ambrose.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.756
I just have to go grab something
back at the house...

17:29.965 --> 17:31.091
from the kitchen.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.223
Long time no see, old friend.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.481
How'd it go?

17:45.564 --> 17:48.150
I got her. How about you?
How did the smelting go?

17:48.233 --> 17:50.319
One morning star hot off the forge.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.072
Ambrose, why isn't this place overgrown?

17:53.655 --> 17:55.532
Well, long ago,

17:55.616 --> 17:59.495
the hedge witch Pesta poisoned the earth
so that nothing green could grow here.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.465
I'll go in first.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.075
Blackwood?

18:41.495 --> 18:44.081
Show yourself, coward.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.711
-Blackwood!
- Shh! There's no need to shout.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.255
I'm right here.

18:59.513 --> 19:03.934
Miss Spellman, you must have come
to offer yourself to the Void.

19:05.269 --> 19:08.147
Oh, yes, that must be it, the Void...

19:09.231 --> 19:10.858
and the other eldritch terrors.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.238
I've brought them an offering.

19:17.781 --> 19:18.949
Oh, you have?

19:20.701 --> 19:23.912
Oh, they like offerings.
Oh, my. Yes, they do.

19:26.915 --> 19:27.749
Crap.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.878
Spare me your feeble witchery.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.443
Brother Ambrose,
is that the best you can muster?

19:57.029 --> 20:00.908
I shall delight
in dismembering you slowly.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.910
But first, behold.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.205
No!

20:28.227 --> 20:30.604
What a creepy, proud smile he has.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.066
What do you reckon he's dreaming about?

20:34.233 --> 20:35.651
Whatever it is, he'd better enjoy it

20:35.734 --> 20:37.861
because he's going to be trapped there
for all eternity.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.239
He won't be smiling for long.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.659
A deal's a deal, Batibat.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.038
Freedom in return
for leaving us Spellmans alone.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.504
All right, cousin, time to get to work.

21:01.802 --> 21:02.636
What was that?

21:03.303 --> 21:05.013
Plant zombies. We must begin.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.891
Once you start the incantation
and the ritual begins,

21:07.975 --> 21:10.269
we cannot stop, not for anything.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.311
Do you understand?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.272
No matter what.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.399
I'll get them back, Ambrose.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.067
I promise.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.236
I'll make it right.

21:19.319 --> 21:20.612
I'll get them all back.

21:26.326 --> 21:31.915
<i>Dei tempus, sit nobis reddere,</i>
<i>iter recipere, ut heri.</i>

21:32.207 --> 21:38.046
<i>Dei tempus, sit nobis reddere,</i>
<i>iter recipere, ut heri.</i>

21:38.964 --> 21:43.635
<i>Dei tempus, sit nobis reddere,</i>
<i>iter recipere, ut heri.</i>

21:43.969 --> 21:48.807
<i>Dei tempus, sit nobis reddere,</i>
<i>iter recipere, ut heri.</i>

21:49.891 --> 21:54.730
<i>Dei tempus, sit nobis reddere,</i>
<i>iter recipere, ut heri.</i>

21:54.813 --> 21:56.440
<i>Dei tempus, sit nobis reddere...</i>

21:56.523 --> 21:57.733
Keep going!

21:57.816 --> 21:59.359
<i>...iter recipere, ut heri.</i>

21:59.443 --> 22:04.197
<i>Dei tempus, sit nobis reddere,</i>
<i>iter recipere, ut heri.</i>

22:04.281 --> 22:06.825
<i>Dei tempus, sit nobis reddere,</i>
<i>iter recipere, ut heri.</i>

22:06.908 --> 22:07.784
Go!

22:09.119 --> 22:13.707
<i>Dei tempus, sit nobis reddere,</i>
<i>iter recipere, ut heri.</i>

22:13.790 --> 22:18.295
<i>Dei tempus, sit nobis reddere,</i>
<i>iter recipere, ut heri.</i>

22:18.378 --> 22:22.883
<i>Dei tempus, sit nobis reddere,</i>
<i>iter recipere, ut heri.</i>

22:43.278 --> 22:44.196
When...

22:52.329 --> 22:53.497
When am I?

22:53.789 --> 22:55.916
It's not here!

22:55.999 --> 23:00.337
We've searched every room in the Academy,
and my prize is not within these walls.

23:01.671 --> 23:02.547
The house.

23:03.298 --> 23:05.092
It must be at the Spellman house.

23:05.175 --> 23:07.344
And if the Spellmans
are there too, Father?

23:07.427 --> 23:10.097
We'll kill them and drink their blood,
of course.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.777
<i>Lanuae magicae.</i>

23:24.236 --> 23:27.364
As long as these candles are burning,
your <i>zansèt--</i>

23:29.157 --> 23:30.075
Guys!

23:30.659 --> 23:33.203
-We have to go right now.
-Cousin, what are you doing here?

23:33.286 --> 23:37.332
-Why aren't you on your quest?
-I was, I am, but this is more important.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.542
Listen to me.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.545
Blackwood is coming here right now
to kill you all.

23:41.628 --> 23:43.463
We have to leave right now
before he gets here.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.216
It will be unwise to move Zelda
in the condition that she is in.

23:46.299 --> 23:49.261
If we don't move her, she will die.

23:49.970 --> 23:52.264
-You'll all die.
-How do you know that?

23:52.806 --> 23:54.641
I'll explain everything later.

23:56.309 --> 23:59.563
But, please,
right now you have to trust me.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.192
All right, cousin. All right.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.741
Find and kill any Spellman
who's in this house.

24:11.825 --> 24:15.454
In the meantime, I shall be hunting down
what is mine, by right!

24:17.664 --> 24:19.458
Prudence, Blackwood's sealed
the hedge witches

24:19.541 --> 24:22.085
in the Desecrated Church.
If you bring them here, their strength

24:22.169 --> 24:24.087
-might be able to bolster Aunt Zee's.
-Absolutely.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.005
No, no, no.

24:25.088 --> 24:26.423
What about Father Blackwood?

24:26.506 --> 24:29.426
He'll have left the Desecrated Church.
He's probably at our house by now.

24:29.509 --> 24:31.720
You have to tell us,
how do you know all of these things?

24:31.803 --> 24:34.723
I can't, and I have to find my friends
before the pagans kill them.

24:35.682 --> 24:36.725
I'll be back soon,

24:36.808 --> 24:37.809
I promise.

24:38.602 --> 24:39.728
<i>Lanuae magicae.</i>

24:41.855 --> 24:44.232
Guys, you're okay. It's not too late.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.276
-What do you mean too late?
-The pagans are coming.

24:46.359 --> 24:48.612
-You have to come with me now.
-Okay, I don't understand.

24:48.695 --> 24:51.031
I saw you walk through a portal
at Dorian's to beat Caliban.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.116
You were right, Nick.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.827
I let everything in Hell pull me away
from what really matters:

24:55.911 --> 24:59.039
my family, my friends, everything I love.

25:00.624 --> 25:01.625
But not anymore.

25:10.800 --> 25:11.885
Any sign of life yet?

25:15.805 --> 25:17.432
I have it! I have the answer.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.810
I know how the coven can regain its power
and defeat the pagans.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.897
-Where am I?
-Oh, Aunt Zee.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.232
You're alive!

25:25.315 --> 25:28.443
Oh, thank...
whoever we're thanking these days.

25:29.027 --> 25:31.112
Aunt Zelda, you're in Dorian's Gray Room.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.198
We're all safe here, for now.

25:34.282 --> 25:35.492
Where's Hilda?

25:36.826 --> 25:39.329
She never resurrects
from the Cain Pit, Auntie.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.122
What?

25:41.665 --> 25:44.918
I mean, she hasn't resurrected
from the Cain Pit yet.

25:45.001 --> 25:47.462
I'm afraid Aunt Hilda is gone.

25:51.132 --> 25:52.175
Impossible.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.178
I left her not one moment ago
in the Nether Realm.

25:55.762 --> 25:59.975
I saw the future,
and Hilda lives to be an old crone.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.726
If she hasn't resurrected on her own,

26:01.810 --> 26:03.645
then I'll use what I learned
in the next life

26:03.728 --> 26:05.855
to drag her back into this one.

26:06.398 --> 26:11.111
Today we will rip our sister Hilda
back from the clutches of death himself.

26:12.195 --> 26:14.906
Now, who amongst you will return
to the Spellman house with me

26:14.990 --> 26:16.116
to do the deed?

26:18.451 --> 26:21.121
It is said that whenever
you call on the Triple Goddess,

26:21.204 --> 26:22.414
she comes to you.

26:23.290 --> 26:27.127
As much as I ignored her,
put my faith in lesser gods,

26:27.794 --> 26:29.588
signed my name in other books,

26:30.547 --> 26:33.925
she still came to me
when I needed her most.

26:35.343 --> 26:38.555
When I wandered, lost in the Nether Realm,

26:39.055 --> 26:42.976
it was she who led me back
to the material world.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.813
We call you, Hecate.

26:56.364 --> 26:58.783
We call on you now, maiden,

26:58.867 --> 27:01.494
in your unbounded potential.

27:02.162 --> 27:07.083
We call on you, mother,
in all your divine power.

27:07.751 --> 27:12.088
We call on you, crone,
in your arcane wisdom.

27:12.547 --> 27:16.676
We are descended of all maidens,
mothers, and crones.

27:17.302 --> 27:22.390
And so, when we call on the three-in-one,
we call on all witches stretching back

27:22.474 --> 27:25.310
from the beginning of time
to the end of days.

27:27.312 --> 27:30.732
We call on... ourselves,

27:31.691 --> 27:33.902
the powers that have been denied us.

27:34.402 --> 27:36.696
Imbue us with them, Hecate,

27:36.780 --> 27:40.200
and we shall pray to you
morning, noon, and night.

27:40.825 --> 27:46.247
And we shall live
to honor thy three faces, thy three forms.

27:51.086 --> 27:56.091
Dark mother, keeper of the key
to the door between worlds,

27:58.218 --> 27:59.135
we...

28:01.096 --> 28:02.597
summon thee.

28:03.723 --> 28:06.685
Return our sister Hilda

28:06.768 --> 28:08.687
to the realm of the living,

28:08.853 --> 28:11.356
and we will never forget you again!

28:35.839 --> 28:36.756
Hilda?

28:41.553 --> 28:42.804
Hildy?

28:43.763 --> 28:45.223
Hildy, are you there?

29:01.906 --> 29:02.866
Hildy.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.140
So, what have I missed?

29:27.223 --> 29:29.976
A lot, Aunt Hilda.
The pagans still need to be stopped.

29:30.059 --> 29:33.021
Oh, bloody pagans.
What trouble are they causing now?

29:33.271 --> 29:35.356
Uh, they're planning on implanting
everyone in town

29:35.440 --> 29:36.983
-with the Green Man's seed.
- How?

29:37.066 --> 29:38.860
By getting them to eat free caramel apples

29:38.943 --> 29:40.695
-at the carnival.
-Yes, and then the Green Man

29:40.779 --> 29:42.405
will pollinate everyone who's been seeded.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.782
So we still need to stop everyone

29:43.865 --> 29:45.658
from going to the carnival
and getting seeded.

29:45.742 --> 29:46.618
How can we do that?

29:46.701 --> 29:49.496
Oh, well, we could sing them
a lovely lullaby.

29:49.996 --> 29:54.918
Right, if we can get the entire town
to fall asleep using an enchanted lullaby,

29:55.001 --> 29:56.419
then all our problems are solved.

29:56.503 --> 29:59.714
No, even without a crowd of mortals,
the pagans will eat the apples,

29:59.798 --> 30:03.176
and they'll offer themselves up,
and it will all still happen.

30:03.259 --> 30:04.719
As long as they have their virgin.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.930
Right, but they didn't get Harvey.

30:07.597 --> 30:12.101
They marked three virgins: Harvey, Theo,
and a teacher from Baxter High.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.312
Ms. Wardwell?

30:14.395 --> 30:16.940
-That bitch shot me.
-Yes!

30:17.023 --> 30:19.859
I'd nearly forgotten
amidst all this insanity, but it was her.

30:19.943 --> 30:23.196
Oh, now a tiny bit of me
wants the pagans to have her.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.911
-We couldn't do that. Could we do that?
-We could do that.

30:29.994 --> 30:34.123
I'm sure there's a logical explanation
for why Ms. Wardwell shot you, Aunt Zee.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.377
But right now, we need her
for the next part of our plan.

30:37.460 --> 30:38.378
We have a plan?

30:38.461 --> 30:39.462
Always.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.840
You guys put the town to sleep
with a lullaby.

30:41.923 --> 30:45.802
I'll track down Ms. Wardwell, and then
what do you say we stop the apocalypse?

30:46.177 --> 30:47.136
Again.

31:31.472 --> 31:35.518
We told them free admission,
free rides, free caramel apples.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.645
It isn't even sunset yet.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.565
No.<i> </i>Something is wrong.<i> </i>I can feel it.

31:40.648 --> 31:42.609
We do not even have a virgin to sacrifice.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.819
Yes, you do.

31:48.281 --> 31:50.283
One of the original three.

31:53.453 --> 31:54.954
Robin Goodfellow.

31:56.539 --> 31:58.416
You betrayed us.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.961
Wasn't it my mission
to infiltrate the school?

32:03.421 --> 32:05.924
And find us a virgin?

32:07.425 --> 32:09.218
Doesn't she please you, Father?

32:11.220 --> 32:12.180
Or...

32:14.265 --> 32:16.267
should we keep the Green Man waiting?

32:26.319 --> 32:27.779
Not one minute more.

32:31.407 --> 32:32.742
Let us begin.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.129
Children...

32:46.297 --> 32:47.966
our hour is at hand.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.513
Who is ready to receive the green one?

32:55.098 --> 32:59.936
Let him rise up and restore
the garden of old for all his pagan brood.

33:00.019 --> 33:01.187
<i>Neallta fola.</i>

33:09.779 --> 33:11.614
You heathens, stop!

33:12.573 --> 33:16.619
It is the Lord
that has laid waste to your fields.

33:17.161 --> 33:19.706
It is he who has made them bare!

33:32.135 --> 33:34.137
Arise and take back the Earth.

33:50.695 --> 33:55.283
And now, the great flowering
and pollination begins!

34:32.862 --> 34:33.696
Who?

34:36.240 --> 34:38.284
Who did you bring us, Robin?

34:39.285 --> 34:40.536
That's Pesta,

34:41.829 --> 34:43.247
the witch of disease.

34:44.165 --> 34:46.667
She's good with decay and rot.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.337
You and your devilment.

34:49.921 --> 34:51.297
What have you done?

34:52.006 --> 34:57.136
Clear your mind, clear your heart,
let these painful thoughts depart.

34:58.596 --> 35:02.058
There, that will keep you out of our way,
Ms. Wardwell.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.102
And when you wake up,

35:04.185 --> 35:06.854
you'll have no memory
of the Spellmans being witches.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.732
I killed your pathetic plant god.

35:11.067 --> 35:14.487
Now I think it's time
you and your carnival left Greendale.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.918
Retreat, my brothers and sisters.

35:29.418 --> 35:30.711
Greendale is poisoned.

35:31.337 --> 35:33.131
We will go and start again.

35:35.007 --> 35:40.304
Coven, do not stop until every last pagan
is driven from our home.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.989
Harvey, wait, that's the gorgon's tent.

35:58.447 --> 36:00.032
I should be the one going in
to slay her.

36:00.116 --> 36:03.536
What?<i> </i>No. Last time I let you
go inside alone, she turned you to stone.

36:03.619 --> 36:06.622
No, but I can keep my eyes closed.
I can use the cunning to see.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.875
Roz, trust me, I can do this.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.377
I'm going in alone.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.172
I've seen <i>Clash of Titans.</i>

36:14.505 --> 36:16.966
If it worked for Perseus,
it will work for me.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.411
Foolish virgin boy.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.804
You should not have come for me alone.

37:11.854 --> 37:12.772
He didn't.

37:16.734 --> 37:17.610
Roz...

37:18.361 --> 37:19.946
you just saved my life.

37:21.447 --> 37:23.032
That's so freaking hot.

37:34.835 --> 37:35.670
What now?

37:39.006 --> 37:40.841
Let's find a bag for her head.

37:42.343 --> 37:43.594
We may need it someday.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.058
Hey, darling.

37:52.478 --> 37:53.896
You going somewhere?

37:56.274 --> 38:00.027
It's just that I was remembering the day
that we first met.

38:01.028 --> 38:05.783
You were so complimentary
about my talents as, um... well...

38:05.866 --> 38:07.285
What do you call it?

38:07.368 --> 38:08.286
Oh, yeah...

38:09.870 --> 38:10.955
a weaver.

38:12.331 --> 38:13.332
Hup!

38:14.292 --> 38:15.876
Before you toddle off,

38:16.961 --> 38:21.507
I just wanted to show you
some of my other talents.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.093
All right, my love?

39:10.264 --> 39:11.182
Ah.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.267
Satan's serviles,

39:14.518 --> 39:16.771
spreading the Dark Lord's only gifts:

39:16.854 --> 39:18.856
death and destruction.

39:20.399 --> 39:22.401
You may have killed our Green Man,

39:22.985 --> 39:27.406
but I am the great god Pan.

39:31.619 --> 39:35.247
And my gaze is madness incarnate,

39:36.165 --> 39:37.458
or had you forgotten?

39:41.879 --> 39:42.880
You know...

39:43.339 --> 39:44.340
we hadn't.

39:45.341 --> 39:46.217
Prudence!

39:58.854 --> 40:03.150
And so Greendale is saved once again.

40:04.026 --> 40:07.321
And tomorrow morning
the town will wake nice and rested.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.824
And none the wiser, sister.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.910
Thank you, Sabrina.

40:13.702 --> 40:17.206
When the coven and your family
needed you the most, you were there.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.750
It was nothing, Aunt Zee.

40:20.334 --> 40:21.544
It was never a question.

40:21.877 --> 40:24.505
I suppose you'll be running off
back to Hell

40:24.588 --> 40:27.133
to finish the third
and final challenge, cousin?

40:27.216 --> 40:29.885
I did. It's done. I handled it.

40:30.469 --> 40:32.555
I won the Unholy Regalia and the throne.

40:33.472 --> 40:38.310
But you're right. I do have to go back
to Hell to finish my business there.

40:39.061 --> 40:40.771
What? When will you be back?

40:42.690 --> 40:44.567
I'm not so sure, Auntie.

40:45.901 --> 40:48.237
Queen of Hell is not the life
we hoped for you, Sabrina.

40:48.863 --> 40:49.780
Me neither.

40:51.449 --> 40:52.992
But it's my destiny.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.999
Oh, don't cry, Aunties.

41:00.082 --> 41:01.667
Oh, who's crying?

41:01.750 --> 41:02.835
I bloody am.

41:02.918 --> 41:04.211
It's okay.

41:07.339 --> 41:08.549
It's not the end.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.469
It's not like you'll never see me again.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.639
But right now,

41:19.101 --> 41:20.102
I've got to go.

41:21.770 --> 41:23.522
There's a promise I have to keep.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.619
Sabrina, stop.

41:36.702 --> 41:39.079
Whatever you do,
don't give them that silver.

41:39.163 --> 41:40.289
What?

41:40.372 --> 41:42.208
Why? Who are you?

41:43.209 --> 41:46.462
I'm you, and I've had a very long day,
so bear with me.

41:46.545 --> 41:49.423
That's not Judas in the wall.
It's Caliban in a glamour.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.342
And the second you hand him that silver

41:51.425 --> 41:53.636
he'll win everything
and trap you down here forever.

41:53.719 --> 41:55.221
But how do you know that?

41:56.555 --> 41:58.140
Because it already happened to me.

42:00.476 --> 42:02.186
I know, it's complicated.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.522
How did you escape?

42:04.939 --> 42:07.149
A friend helped me out,

42:07.233 --> 42:10.444
and I was supposed to do the same thing
for her to keep the time loop going,

42:10.528 --> 42:13.864
but I changed my mind
because I realized something.

42:13.948 --> 42:14.949
What?

42:15.032 --> 42:17.785
I can meet you here
in this moment in time,

42:17.868 --> 42:21.705
before there's even a time loop,
to when there's two of us, free.

42:22.748 --> 42:25.834
Well, shouldn't we merge or something?

42:25.918 --> 42:29.880
Ambrose would say so, yes,
but I have a supes crazy idea.

42:32.132 --> 42:33.968
I think I just had the same one.

42:34.051 --> 42:36.053
After everything I've been through,

42:36.262 --> 42:38.138
what I saw happen to my family
and friends,

42:38.222 --> 42:40.474
I wanna go home to be with them.

42:40.891 --> 42:41.725
But you...

42:42.643 --> 42:44.520
you just won the Unholy Regalia.

42:44.603 --> 42:46.647
You still want the throne and to be Queen.

42:47.606 --> 42:50.234
I kind of do. Is that weird?

42:50.317 --> 42:54.113
No. It's perfect,
because I want to be a teenager.

42:54.655 --> 42:57.032
So, what do you say we do both?

43:05.416 --> 43:07.793
Judas, I have your pieces of silver.

43:08.168 --> 43:10.045
Did you get them all?

43:10.462 --> 43:12.881
Yes, I counted them.

43:13.382 --> 43:18.053
Let me feel the weight of them
in my hands one last time.

43:25.102 --> 43:27.021
Nice try, Caliban.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.648
But I'm not an idiot,
you're wearing a glamour,

43:29.732 --> 43:32.192
and I won't be making
the same mistake twice.

43:33.944 --> 43:36.238
How can this be?
How did you know?

43:36.322 --> 43:39.783
Because I'm one step ahead of you
and twice the monarch you could ever be.

44:03.140 --> 44:05.100
The challenge has been won.

44:05.809 --> 44:08.896
The final item of the Unholy Regalia
is mine.

44:11.774 --> 44:16.070
And Prince Caliban is stone-cold dead.

44:17.863 --> 44:19.198
Congratulations, daughter.

44:19.740 --> 44:21.325
You bring honor to our house.

44:22.451 --> 44:26.497
It is time, once again,
for your coronation.

44:27.164 --> 44:30.501
Are you at last ready?

44:33.712 --> 44:37.758
I am ready, Father, to be married to Hell.

44:39.593 --> 44:44.056
Lilith, in your last act as regent,
will you prepare our young queen?

44:58.570 --> 45:01.448
<i>This is the story of how the world ended,</i>

45:01.532 --> 45:02.700
<i>and then did not,</i>

45:03.158 --> 45:05.953
<i>saved by the witch who would be Queen.</i>

45:06.578 --> 45:08.580
<i>And as she prepared for the throne,</i>

45:08.664 --> 45:12.584
<i>all across the realms,</i>
<i>things returned to their natural balance.</i>

45:14.962 --> 45:16.964
Robin, are you really going to stay
in Greendale?

45:18.590 --> 45:19.883
Why would I leave?

45:22.511 --> 45:23.345
Okay.

45:32.813 --> 45:35.983
You are the glory
and pride of Satan.

45:36.859 --> 45:41.864
The face of the Hell-bound hordes.

45:43.907 --> 45:45.617
I love you, Rosalind.

45:47.745 --> 45:48.954
That's my truth.

45:49.913 --> 45:52.583
I love you too, Harvey Kinkle.

46:16.774 --> 46:21.278
Strike down your enemies
by tooth and by claw,

46:21.862 --> 46:25.115
and bathe your skin in their blood.

46:31.497 --> 46:37.002
We brought Dr. Cee's, um,
cocoon from the store.

46:37.085 --> 46:41.882
He's downstairs ready for you,
if you want to say goodbye.

46:50.349 --> 46:51.308
Dr. Cee?

46:51.809 --> 46:52.976
Hilda.

46:54.770 --> 46:57.564
I thought... I thought I murdered you!

46:58.106 --> 47:00.609
Oh, well, nearly, but not quite, my love.

47:07.407 --> 47:08.450
Whoo!

47:08.826 --> 47:11.286
I must have been saving you
to eat later, hey?

47:11.370 --> 47:13.372
Oh, here's hoping.

47:29.137 --> 47:32.808
Every queen must be made battle-ready.

47:33.809 --> 47:35.853
Every girl must prepare for war.

47:45.988 --> 47:48.740
Prudence, what is it?

47:49.575 --> 47:50.868
What's the matter?

47:52.035 --> 47:53.120
We, uh...

47:55.289 --> 47:57.040
we found Dorcas

47:57.791 --> 48:00.711
butchered in a cupboard
at the Academy, Ambrose.

48:02.421 --> 48:04.381
By Agatha's hand, no doubt.

48:05.382 --> 48:06.675
Oh, no.

48:08.510 --> 48:10.637
You know,
I can't help but to think that...

48:11.763 --> 48:14.766
if I had killed Blackwood in Scotland
when I had the chance,

48:14.850 --> 48:17.644
all this calamity could have been avoided.

48:20.439 --> 48:23.191
But you wouldn't let me, would you?

48:23.901 --> 48:25.360
I am so sorry.

48:29.573 --> 48:30.616
As am I.

48:38.248 --> 48:39.625
Gird your loins,

48:40.792 --> 48:42.169
let nothing touch you,

48:42.878 --> 48:46.256
let no man hold power over you.

48:48.175 --> 48:51.678
What are you now,
if not the Church of Night?

48:52.471 --> 48:56.016
The Order of Hecate,
worshiping the three-in-one.

48:57.392 --> 48:58.435
Zelda...

49:00.354 --> 49:04.107
there's an even darker force
on the horizon, I fear.

49:05.359 --> 49:10.864
A sense of <i>sa ki mal</i> lingers in the air.

49:12.032 --> 49:16.995
We must harness your coven's
maternal <i>pouvoir</i> for protection,

49:17.496 --> 49:19.456
and prepare them for war.

49:20.958 --> 49:23.794
Am I to take it that means
you'll be staying on?

49:27.923 --> 49:32.177
Only if I am welcome, <i>ma chérie.</i>

49:46.817 --> 49:48.986
And when they cry out for mercy,

49:52.406 --> 49:55.492
the Morningstar must show them none.

50:08.088 --> 50:09.631
What are you so sad about?

50:10.257 --> 50:11.758
Didn't you hear we won?

50:11.842 --> 50:14.636
Yes, but not everyone survived, Nicholas.

50:19.683 --> 50:21.018
I'm sorry, Nicky.

50:23.061 --> 50:25.772
It's just without my sisters,
I've just never felt so...

50:25.856 --> 50:26.815
Alone.

50:38.744 --> 50:39.703
Same.

51:07.272 --> 51:09.608
Your crown and throne await you.

51:11.318 --> 51:15.322
First Lady of Pandemonium,
maiden of shadows.

51:16.740 --> 51:18.283
Behold the Queen...

51:22.537 --> 51:24.247
Sabrina Morningstar.

51:29.920 --> 51:33.465
Well, I'll get started on something.

51:35.342 --> 51:39.304
Let's... I mean, let's have
a lovely family dinner,

51:40.639 --> 51:42.307
favorite dishes only?

51:43.433 --> 51:45.685
It won't be the same without Sabrina,
will it?

51:46.770 --> 51:49.439
Aunt Zee, do you really think
I'd miss a family dinner?

51:49.523 --> 51:52.109
Sabrina, what are you doing here?

51:52.192 --> 51:55.237
What about your responsibilities in Hell?

51:55.320 --> 51:56.238
Your destiny?

51:56.321 --> 51:59.282
I changed my mind.
Who wants to deal with all that <i>meshugas?</i>

51:59.366 --> 52:00.200
I thought you did.

52:00.283 --> 52:02.369
You certainly tried hard enough
to win the throne.

52:02.452 --> 52:06.164
A part of me did want to be Queen,
but another part of me thought,

52:06.248 --> 52:07.791
"I'm a teenager."

52:08.250 --> 52:10.794
I want to be a teenager
here in Greendale

52:10.877 --> 52:12.754
at Baxter High and the Academy.

52:14.172 --> 52:17.801
Oh, besides, all our business
with Hell is done.

52:17.884 --> 52:21.304
It's not like we'll be crossing paths
with those guys again, right?

52:22.514 --> 52:27.310
Oh, Lucifer, Lilith, Caliban,
who needs them?

52:27.394 --> 52:28.812
Yeah, good point.

52:29.563 --> 52:31.314
I'm going to go wash up for dinner.

52:41.241 --> 52:42.075
Cousin...

52:44.494 --> 52:46.705
you've been lying about something.
I just don't know what.

52:47.247 --> 52:49.541
I'm not sure what you mean.

52:50.167 --> 52:52.043
You've been acting strangely lately,

52:52.127 --> 52:54.838
saying things,
knowing things that you couldn't know.

52:54.921 --> 52:56.631
Even amidst of all this insanity,

52:57.215 --> 53:00.427
you are the one thing
that feels truly off to me.

53:02.929 --> 53:05.640
I don't think you gave up the throne
at all, did you?

53:06.308 --> 53:10.854
I wasn't lying,
I'm not the Queen of Hell...

53:12.022 --> 53:13.356
...but also...

53:14.441 --> 53:15.442
I am.

53:17.068 --> 53:19.404
Well, what have you gone and done now?

53:20.405 --> 53:23.116
Shouldn't we merge or something?

53:23.200 --> 53:26.912
Ambrose would say so, yes,
but I have a supes crazy idea.

53:26.995 --> 53:28.705
I think I just had the same one.

53:28.788 --> 53:30.415
That shouldn't even be possible.

53:30.916 --> 53:33.793
If you never fulfilled your role
and freed yourself in the first place,

53:34.502 --> 53:39.007
the fact that there are two of you...
You have created a time paradox.

53:39.883 --> 53:40.717
Cool.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.594
No, not cool, not at all.

53:42.677 --> 53:45.972
No, the ramifications
of this are horrifying at best.

53:46.056 --> 53:49.184
But it worked. She's her, I'm me.

53:49.267 --> 53:50.977
We both got what we wanted.

53:51.561 --> 53:54.064
Don't you see? This solves everything.

53:54.147 --> 53:56.775
I can finally be a Spellman
and a Morningstar.

53:56.858 --> 53:58.401
What happens when the aunties
find out

53:58.485 --> 54:00.654
-there are two of you?
-Aunties have never been to Hell,

54:00.737 --> 54:02.364
so there's zero chance
of that happening.

54:02.447 --> 54:04.491
What happens
when the Dark Lord discovers?

54:04.574 --> 54:06.493
He's such a narcissist,
he won't even notice.

54:06.576 --> 54:08.119
Lilith notices everything!

54:09.621 --> 54:11.706
Lilith could be a problem, yep.

54:16.002 --> 54:19.673
Right, cousin, so, um...
just so I'm clear,

54:20.715 --> 54:23.802
you're saying that there are two of you.
So, if you're here,

54:24.761 --> 54:26.096
then that means she's--

56:08.865 --> 56:11.201
I must say, that was delicious, Hilda.

56:11.743 --> 56:12.869
Well, thank you.

56:12.952 --> 56:15.246
So nice to have things
back to normal again.

56:15.330 --> 56:18.875
Not that they'll stay that way
for long in Greendale. Just you wait.

56:20.085 --> 56:23.630
Everything has consequences,
and there are always loose ends.

56:24.714 --> 56:27.175
Have a little faith, Ambrose.

56:27.258 --> 56:31.346
Sometimes the cosmos
just sorts itself out.

56:38.269 --> 56:40.063
Does anyone have room for pie?

56:40.313 --> 56:41.189
-Yes.
-Yes.

56:41.272 --> 56:42.774
Yes, yes, yes.

56:43.316 --> 56:45.527
And one of those delicious potatoes.

56:49.906 --> 56:52.951
Come, children,
under the starry abyss of night,

56:53.034 --> 56:55.203
we shall commit our atrocity.

56:55.286 --> 56:56.579
Agatha, the egg.

57:01.709 --> 57:05.839
I call upon the eldritch terrors
in the name of the Void.

57:07.674 --> 57:10.218
Hear the birth cries of this abomination

57:10.301 --> 57:13.680
and tear through the skin of reality.

57:13.763 --> 57:15.932
I am your vessel.

57:17.434 --> 57:21.896
I am your priest.

58:00.935 --> 58:01.978
Father...

58:03.229 --> 58:04.397
what have we birthed?

58:14.908 --> 58:17.494
The beginning of the end, Agatha.

58:18.912 --> 58:20.663
The end of the Spellmans.

58:23.249 --> 58:24.626
The end of all things.

59:50.712 --> 59:52.880
Greg, move your head!
