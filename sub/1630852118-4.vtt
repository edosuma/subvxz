WEBVTT

00:11.052 --> 00:15.932
VILLAHERMOSA-TEAPA FREEWAY, TABASCO

00:37.537 --> 00:41.124
What we do is very delicate and dangerous.

00:41.207 --> 00:45.253
We wanted to take advantage
of this moment to make this public,

00:45.336 --> 00:49.632
because that's how things should be done,
in a public and transparent manner.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.719
Last Sunday, there was an incident

00:52.802 --> 00:56.097
in which myself and a few others

00:56.181 --> 00:58.391
who are taking part in this trial,

00:58.475 --> 01:02.937
experts that were assigned
to assess one of the cases

01:03.021 --> 01:05.440
that were shown here

01:05.523 --> 01:07.650
and that Roberto has been recording…

01:08.610 --> 01:12.572
What happened was
that the vehicle we were in,

01:12.655 --> 01:15.784
suddenly, completely out of the blue,
stopped dead.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.286
It had an electrical-mechanical failure.

01:18.369 --> 01:22.415
We had to pull over and, immediately,
out of nowhere, it caught fire.

01:23.958 --> 01:26.086
Smoke started coming out of the engine.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.880
"That's odd," I thought.

01:28.963 --> 01:32.842
The power steering got stuck.
I couldn't move the steering wheel.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.427
That's not normal,

01:34.511 --> 01:38.139
because even in hydraulic systems,
you can always move it.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.599
This one didn't move.

01:39.682 --> 01:43.561
This made us think
it was something else.

01:44.229 --> 01:48.483
Of course, given our line of work,
we started hypothesizing

01:48.566 --> 01:50.068
about what it could have been.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.362
What seemed more likely

01:52.445 --> 01:58.451
was that someone, a third party,
had altered something in the car.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.247
We will inform
the corresponding legal authorities,

02:02.330 --> 02:05.375
and we will investigate every possibility

02:05.458 --> 02:08.253
to determine what caused the incident.

02:08.336 --> 02:12.298
But we'd appreciate if the media
refrained from publishing conclusions.

02:12.382 --> 02:17.137
We saw an article that stated
the fire was caused by a short circuit.

02:17.220 --> 02:21.307
In my opinion and the experts' opinion,
that was not the case.

02:21.391 --> 02:25.812
The van was locked,
all the doors and the trunk,

02:25.895 --> 02:27.522
making it impossible to get out.

02:27.605 --> 02:30.900
Luckily, we were able
to force the doors open.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.528
I was in the front
and pushed one door open.

02:33.611 --> 02:34.571
Everyone got out

02:34.654 --> 02:39.200
and a few seconds later,
the car was in flames.

02:39.909 --> 02:43.204
When you shine a light on shadows,
the shadows disappear.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.416
So making this public knowledge,
what happened to us,

02:46.499 --> 02:50.461
should keep it from happening again.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.339
There was a point where we thought,

02:53.423 --> 02:57.468
"They will abandon us.
They will drop the case

02:57.552 --> 03:00.597
and things will get harder
and harder for us."

03:07.729 --> 03:11.566
A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY SERIES

04:05.119 --> 04:08.373
I think ACP
is an indirect victim of crime.

04:08.456 --> 04:10.208
He's from a community

04:10.291 --> 04:14.879
where kidnappings were commonplace,
they happened all the time.

04:14.963 --> 04:18.591
He probably felt he was at risk

04:18.675 --> 04:21.052
of suffering the same fate.

04:22.762 --> 04:26.099
Here we have a person
whose brother, days before,

04:26.182 --> 04:28.434
was a victim of an attempted kidnapping.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.812
GLP, his sister, was in fact kidnapped.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.522
And Mr. ACP…

04:32.605 --> 04:35.108
We have to understand his emotional state.

04:35.191 --> 04:38.945
If you have been through
these types of situations,

04:39.028 --> 04:41.572
and see someone approaching your car,

04:41.656 --> 04:45.618
sure, you'll probably think
they want to kidnap you

04:45.702 --> 04:47.120
or even kill you.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.455
That is understandable.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.375
And when you comprehend that aspect,

04:53.001 --> 04:55.503
you begin to understand that it's possible

04:55.586 --> 04:58.548
that things may have happened
the way we told them.

05:00.216 --> 05:04.679
PUBLIC TRIAL HEARING
FEBRUARY 26TH, 2018

05:14.856 --> 05:16.816
<i>-You may continue.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

05:17.525 --> 05:19.068
<i>Please, address the court.</i>

05:19.152 --> 05:23.197
<i>Are the people that tried to deprive you</i>
<i>of your freedom here?</i>

05:27.785 --> 05:29.329
<i>Victim, you may answer.</i>

05:31.706 --> 05:36.461
MR. ACP
PROSECUTION WITNESS

05:36.544 --> 05:37.754
<i>No… yes.</i>

05:40.631 --> 05:41.966
<i>There…</i>

05:42.675 --> 05:44.886
<i>On the left, there is…</i>

05:46.095 --> 05:47.138
<i>Juan Luis.</i>

05:48.097 --> 05:50.391
<i>In the middle, Héctor.</i>

05:51.267 --> 05:52.560
<i>And then…</i>

05:54.187 --> 05:55.730
<i>And then, Gonzalo.</i>

05:57.523 --> 06:00.735
<i>Are you aware</i>
<i>that lying in court is a crime?</i>

06:01.944 --> 06:03.571
<i>No, could you repeat that?</i>

06:03.654 --> 06:06.949
<i>Are you aware</i>
<i>that lying in court is a crime?</i>

06:09.535 --> 06:10.536
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

06:12.121 --> 06:14.290
<i>Is it true that the person</i>

06:15.375 --> 06:17.752
<i>that allegedly pointed at you with a gun</i>

06:17.835 --> 06:20.380
<i>stuck his hand through</i>
<i>the window of your van?</i>

06:25.176 --> 06:28.388
<i>Well, yes and no,</i>
<i>because he didn't manage to--</i>

06:28.471 --> 06:30.223
<i>Yes or no, please, sir.</i>

06:30.306 --> 06:31.265
<i>Yes.</i>

06:33.476 --> 06:36.687
<i>He reached</i>
<i>through the passenger window, right?</i>

06:37.980 --> 06:39.023
<i>Yes.</i>

06:40.400 --> 06:44.153
The only photos in the investigation file

06:44.862 --> 06:48.074
showed that the passenger window
was shattered.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.243
That means it had been closed.

06:50.326 --> 06:53.162
And he broke it
when he shot from the interior.

06:54.330 --> 06:57.625
<i>And when you shot,</i>
<i>the bullet hit his right hand.</i>

06:58.376 --> 07:02.171
<i>I didn't want to hit him, just scare him.</i>

07:02.255 --> 07:05.133
<i>My intention wasn't to hurt him.</i>

07:05.216 --> 07:07.093
<i>It was an accident.</i>

07:07.635 --> 07:11.139
<i>I think the bullet hit his hand,</i>
<i>but I'm not sure, I didn't see.</i>

07:11.639 --> 07:16.102
<i>Please, tell the court</i>
<i>why you had that gun on you.</i>

07:16.185 --> 07:17.728
<i>It's a .22 caliber pistol</i>

07:17.812 --> 07:22.442
<i>that a friend gave me to work on.</i>

07:22.525 --> 07:26.737
<i>Do you have a permit</i>
<i>for that type of firearm?</i>

07:26.821 --> 07:29.073
<i>Yes, Your Honor. I have a permit</i>

07:29.949 --> 07:31.284
<i>for a .22 caliber.</i>

07:32.034 --> 07:34.203
<i>Do you have a permit</i>

07:34.287 --> 07:38.541
<i>to carry that particular .22 pistol</i>
<i>that your friend gave you?</i>

07:42.670 --> 07:44.714
<i>Yes, I think so… I guess.</i>

07:45.298 --> 07:46.299
<i>You guess.</i>

07:46.382 --> 07:49.343
<i>I don't know, the defense told me</i>
<i>it wasn't for carrying,</i>

07:49.427 --> 07:50.928
<i>that I had registered it.</i>

07:52.763 --> 07:54.557
Carrying a firearm,

07:55.099 --> 07:57.727
no matter the caliber
or if it is registered,

07:57.810 --> 08:00.188
without a permit, which is something else,

08:00.271 --> 08:01.105
is a crime.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.025
There is nothing that can legally justify

08:04.108 --> 08:07.361
that he had a gun
and shot someone that wasn't armed.

08:07.445 --> 08:11.282
<i>Are you aware it is a crime</i>
<i>to carry a gun without a permit?</i>

08:11.365 --> 08:13.576
<i>-I have various--</i>
<i>-Sir, yes or no?</i>

08:13.659 --> 08:16.829
<i>-Carrying it is an crime, yes.</i>
<i>-Yes or no, sir.</i>

08:16.913 --> 08:19.957
<i>Honorable court, may I make a request?</i>

08:20.041 --> 08:21.209
<i>Go ahead.</i>

08:21.292 --> 08:23.544
<i>Can the victim take five minutes?</i>

08:23.628 --> 08:26.506
<i>He's getting unsettled.</i>

08:27.256 --> 08:28.841
<i>Just so he calms down.</i>

08:28.925 --> 08:29.884
<i>Does he qualify?</i>

08:32.178 --> 08:36.474
<i>He is telling me his brain hurts.</i>

08:37.391 --> 08:39.769
<i>That's why I want the five minutes,</i>

08:39.852 --> 08:43.481
<i>so he can relax</i>
<i>and properly answer the questions.</i>

08:43.564 --> 08:44.565
<i>Prosecution?</i>

08:46.275 --> 08:49.612
<i>Your Honor, this social worker points out</i>

08:49.695 --> 08:53.866
<i>that the victim suffers from hypertension</i>

08:53.950 --> 08:59.914
<i>and that apparently, a few days ago,</i>
<i>he presented unstable angina.</i>

08:59.997 --> 09:01.165
<i>Very well. Defense?</i>

09:01.249 --> 09:03.209
<i>Your Honor, we have no evidence</i>

09:03.292 --> 09:05.962
<i>that those statements are true.</i>

09:06.045 --> 09:08.130
<i>He was responding just fine.</i>

09:08.214 --> 09:10.258
<i>The questions got uncomfortable</i>

09:10.341 --> 09:12.593
<i>and started affecting their case</i>

09:12.677 --> 09:14.929
<i>and, all of a sudden, he needs time</i>

09:15.012 --> 09:17.181
<i>to be able to think about his answers.</i>

09:17.265 --> 09:20.059
<i>We don't see a justification</i>
<i>for their request.</i>

09:20.142 --> 09:23.646
<i>And as you can see yourselves,</i>
<i>nothing was wrong with him</i>

09:23.729 --> 09:25.982
<i>when the psychologist interceded.</i>

09:26.649 --> 09:30.236
<i>Mr. ACP, what do you have to say?</i>

09:31.362 --> 09:34.282
<i>My health was suffering in November. I…</i>

09:34.365 --> 09:36.492
<i>I mean about right now.</i>

09:36.576 --> 09:38.202
<i>Well…</i>

09:38.286 --> 09:39.745
<i>Let's continue.</i>

09:39.829 --> 09:42.248
<i>Do you feel you are able to continue?</i>

09:42.331 --> 09:44.375
<i>Yes, I'd like to get it over with.</i>

09:45.543 --> 09:48.546
<i>Did you ever show to any authority</i>

09:49.297 --> 09:55.177
<i>the registration permit for the pistol</i>
<i>you used to shoot Mr. Héctor?</i>

09:58.097 --> 09:59.307
<i>Yes or no, please.</i>

10:03.894 --> 10:06.022
<i>Mr. ACP, yes or no, please.</i>

10:08.232 --> 10:10.067
<i>I showed it to the DA.</i>

10:12.820 --> 10:16.657
<i>So you showed the permit</i>
<i>to the DA. Correct?</i>

10:23.205 --> 10:26.250
<i>Mr. ACP, I'm asking you a question.</i>
<i>Please, answer.</i>

10:26.334 --> 10:27.460
<i>No.</i>

10:27.543 --> 10:28.628
<i>No?</i>

10:28.711 --> 10:32.173
<i>No. Actually, I just told her about it.</i>

10:32.757 --> 10:34.842
<i>I can't say things that aren't true.</i>

10:37.303 --> 10:40.765
<i>You did not hand over the gun</i>
<i>to the authorities. Correct?</i>

10:43.893 --> 10:46.646
<i>Mr. ACP, please, yes or no?</i>

10:49.190 --> 10:50.066
<i>No.</i>

10:51.275 --> 10:52.485
<i>Nothing further.</i>

10:53.778 --> 10:57.990
-When is the hearing?
-On September 7th, at 8:15.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.158
In a month.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.285
That's what's been happening.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.955
As long as the civil servants
don't change their way of thinking,

11:05.039 --> 11:07.041
or are more socially aware…

11:07.124 --> 11:11.754
The prosecution just says,
"One more month, no problem."

11:11.837 --> 11:13.964
And we've told them,

11:14.048 --> 11:16.967
"It's not a problem for you
because you're free."

11:17.051 --> 11:21.222
"After three years in prison,
one day, one hour, one month is a lot."

11:22.014 --> 11:24.058
As they say, time feels different

11:24.141 --> 11:27.395
depending on which side
of the bathroom door you're on.

11:49.166 --> 11:53.421
<i>Please, enter your inmate</i>
<i>identification number.</i>

11:59.969 --> 12:03.514
<i>Please wait while your call</i>
<i>is being redirected.</i>

12:07.476 --> 12:10.855
Our parents are the ones
who have supported us the most.

12:11.689 --> 12:12.565
Our mothers.

12:12.648 --> 12:15.401
Aside from them, there's nobody.

12:15.985 --> 12:20.072
It's been so long since I saw the kids.
You haven't visited in a month.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.033
<i>We took them in December.</i>

12:23.117 --> 12:25.745
Right, that's what I mean. December…

12:25.828 --> 12:27.496
January, February, March.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.914
<i>It's been some time.</i>

12:28.998 --> 12:30.416
Come on!

12:30.499 --> 12:33.544
-It will be December soon.
-<i>Your time is over.</i>

12:33.627 --> 12:34.628
Damn!

12:37.590 --> 12:40.551
The first nine months, everyone shows up.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.762
They are all there for you.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.222
After nine months,

12:45.306 --> 12:47.767
after the first year, they disappear.

12:47.850 --> 12:51.812
The days go by
and they start forgetting you.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.356
I had a lot of friends,

12:54.440 --> 12:55.483
where are they?

12:55.983 --> 12:57.318
I have none left.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.157
-Muñoz Muñoz, Héctor.
-Here!

13:06.285 --> 13:08.704
If I hadn't received any visitors here…

13:10.998 --> 13:12.208
I don't think

13:12.708 --> 13:14.710
I would have lasted this long.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.004
Honestly.

13:30.559 --> 13:34.021
No, we can't visit him often,

13:34.104 --> 13:36.816
because I have my two daughters.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.818
I have school expenses.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.736
And my parents live far away.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.863
My parents, in order to visit him,

13:42.947 --> 13:46.826
have to spend almost a thousand pesos
just on the bus tickets.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.118
Just the tickets.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.746
And if both of them come, it's more.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.874
And my mom
has to take care of my three nephews.

13:55.292 --> 13:57.002
I tell my mom not to come,

13:57.086 --> 14:00.339
but her love is always…

14:02.466 --> 14:05.928
She always wants to be with me,
she wants to visit me.

14:06.011 --> 14:09.932
And I know
how much it hurts her to see me here.

14:20.484 --> 14:25.698
1,233 DAYS IN PRISON
THE VERDICT

14:32.329 --> 14:36.542
I think one of the problems we face
is the amount of time

14:36.625 --> 14:39.670
that's gone by since all this started
in February,

14:39.753 --> 14:42.131
then it was deferred to March,

14:42.214 --> 14:44.049
and now it's September.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.885
It's a six-month public trial.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.805
There have been
huge gaps between hearings.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.974
The judges lose any sense of immediacy

14:52.057 --> 14:54.852
and they don't feel the same emotion

14:54.935 --> 14:57.646
they felt when the witnesses testified.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.023
What is your feeling…?

14:59.106 --> 15:03.819
We are very calm and confident
about our performance.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.905
If they follow the law,

15:05.988 --> 15:07.615
they can't find them guilty.

15:07.698 --> 15:12.119
I think I'm emotionally
and mentally prepared

15:12.202 --> 15:14.997
to see him released today.

15:15.706 --> 15:18.667
But for the other outcome,
I'm not prepared, no.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.378
"If they set us free, what will I do?"

15:21.462 --> 15:23.547
I'll run to my family and hug them,

15:23.631 --> 15:25.758
I'll jump for joy, I don't know.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.218
But I want to hear it first.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.721
I got up a bit earlier than usual.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.725
I had a shower, I fixed my hair.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.563
We got ready for the public trial.

15:49.156 --> 15:53.702
But when we sat down
and the judges started coming in,

15:53.786 --> 15:55.746
I saw their faces…

15:56.872 --> 15:58.999
The three of them looked at us

15:59.083 --> 16:00.876
and I saw in their expression…

16:02.461 --> 16:04.046
that they were pissed off.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.550
It had been a discontinuous process.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.345
The hearings had been interrupted.

16:11.428 --> 16:13.430
But the most alarming thing

16:13.514 --> 16:15.599
was that at the time of the verdict,

16:15.683 --> 16:19.603
one of the judges of the court
had been replaced by a new one.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.606
It wasn't the same court anymore.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.900
One court heard the evidence,

16:24.984 --> 16:26.944
and another court will decide.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.572
I remember clearly
the attitude of the judges.

16:31.156 --> 16:34.910
They didn't look comfortable
with their decision.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.455
They were not convinced
of what they were saying.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.710
<i>Okay. Having deliberated</i>

16:42.793 --> 16:47.840
<i>within the time frame</i>
<i>established by our legislation,</i>

16:47.923 --> 16:51.051
<i>I will now give the floor</i>
<i>to my fellow judge</i>

16:51.135 --> 16:53.303
<i>to read out the ruling</i>

16:53.387 --> 16:57.766
<i>this trial court has decided on.</i>

16:58.559 --> 17:00.936
I felt something was wrong.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.063
I thought…

17:04.523 --> 17:05.899
"We're not leaving."

17:05.983 --> 17:08.193
<i>This court has unanimously decided</i>

17:08.277 --> 17:10.738
<i>to rule against Juan Luis López García,</i>

17:10.821 --> 17:13.741
<i>Héctor Muñoz Muñoz</i>
<i>and Gonzalo García Hernández,</i>

17:13.824 --> 17:17.411
<i>based on the accusation</i>
<i>made by the prosecutor's office</i>

17:17.494 --> 17:20.414
<i>in the criminal case 33, from 2015,</i>

17:20.497 --> 17:23.542
<i>of attempted aggravated kidnapping</i>

17:23.625 --> 17:24.960
<i>of ACP.</i>

17:25.044 --> 17:25.961
I felt cold.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.547
I had goosebumps.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.884
When we got the news,

17:33.177 --> 17:36.055
I forgot about the cold, about everything.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.098
Because…

17:39.183 --> 17:41.226
I had this idea…

17:43.228 --> 17:44.772
that I'd get out

17:45.647 --> 17:49.068
and find a job quickly, for my kids.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.361
<i>Regarding the criminal responsibility</i>

17:51.445 --> 17:54.948
<i>of the accused, Héctor Muñoz Muñoz,</i>
<i>Gonzalo García Hernández</i>

17:55.032 --> 17:56.700
<i>and Juan Luis López García,</i>

17:56.784 --> 17:59.286
<i>we believe it was proved beyond doubt</i>

17:59.369 --> 18:03.791
<i>through the logical and legal correlation</i>
<i>of the evidence provided.</i>

18:03.874 --> 18:05.918
I remember we were mad,

18:06.001 --> 18:07.711
because, for starters,

18:07.795 --> 18:10.506
they had decided
the crime was a proven fact.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.424
We were like, "Wait a minute."

18:12.508 --> 18:16.303
For us, there wasn't any proof
of an attempted kidnapping.

18:16.386 --> 18:19.139
We started realizing
this wasn't going well

18:19.223 --> 18:23.310
as soon as the judge
started explaining the verdict.

18:23.393 --> 18:27.564
<i>Against the accused,</i>
<i>we have the testimony of ACP, the victim,</i>

18:27.648 --> 18:30.025
<i>and of the eyewitness, ACC.</i>

18:30.109 --> 18:33.779
<i>With their spontaneous,</i>
<i>chronological and detailed statements,</i>

18:33.862 --> 18:35.989
<i>they demonstrated before this court</i>

18:36.573 --> 18:40.160
<i>the behavior of each of the accused men.</i>

18:40.244 --> 18:41.787
<i>We deem irrelevant</i>

18:41.870 --> 18:45.666
<i>the statement of Dr. Edward Charles</i>
<i>Alexander Worrall González</i>

18:45.749 --> 18:50.003
<i>about the reconstruction of the events</i>
<i>of September 9th, 2017.</i>

18:50.087 --> 18:52.089
In the public trial,

18:52.172 --> 18:56.593
they decided to completely ignore
the reconstruction of events

18:56.677 --> 18:59.263
performed by the experts

18:59.346 --> 19:03.016
because they hadn't carried it out
with the exact same van,

19:03.100 --> 19:05.102
on the same day, at the same time.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.895
That had no influence at all,

19:06.979 --> 19:08.480
because we were assessing

19:08.564 --> 19:12.526
the trajectory of the bullet
that came out of the firearm,

19:12.609 --> 19:13.986
the injury it caused,

19:14.069 --> 19:17.156
and if it is consistent
with the statements provided.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.907
All this taking into account

19:18.991 --> 19:22.369
that they are responsible
for proving the accused are guilty,

19:22.452 --> 19:23.745
not us their innocence.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.670
Andrés will tell you what will happen,
but this is not over.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.381
The sentence has no basis.

19:35.632 --> 19:36.550
I'm very sorry.

19:37.134 --> 19:43.182
NEW CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN TABASCO

19:44.808 --> 19:46.810
I can't take this any longer.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.607
<i>They said we'd be released.</i>

19:54.693 --> 19:57.613
<i>To hell with that. I can't believe it.</i>

19:58.655 --> 20:00.782
<i>I can't believe what they are doing.</i>

20:01.700 --> 20:05.287
<i>No. I think if we had lied,</i>
<i>we'd be free by now.</i>

20:06.914 --> 20:07.915
It's a joke.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.334
And what took them so long?

20:11.126 --> 20:12.169
We don't know.

20:12.252 --> 20:15.505
As I said,
probably because they were looking

20:15.589 --> 20:18.217
for a way to justify finding them guilty,

20:18.300 --> 20:20.594
and twist everything we showed them.

20:20.677 --> 20:23.388
It's completely unbelievable
that they consider

20:23.472 --> 20:26.141
this crime proven
beyond any reasonable doubt.

20:42.866 --> 20:44.576
STATE POLICE

21:02.928 --> 21:06.974
Then there is the sentencing hearing.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.100
What is it for?

21:08.183 --> 21:12.479
In this hearing,
you are told how many years you'll serve.

21:13.146 --> 21:16.149
That first day, we were pissed off.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.361
We came back here, disheartened.

21:20.070 --> 21:26.410
We were thinking
we would have to serve many years.

21:29.579 --> 21:36.545
SENTENCING
SEPTEMBER 17TH, 2018

21:56.815 --> 22:01.445
I saw them looking ashamed, embarrassed.

22:02.070 --> 22:05.574
And in the end, when we found out

22:05.657 --> 22:10.954
what the sentence was,
how many years they were getting,

22:12.539 --> 22:15.751
there were a series of looks
that, to me, seemed to say,

22:16.376 --> 22:20.047
"Okay, now at least
this makes it a bit better."

22:20.130 --> 22:22.007
<i>For being found guilty</i>

22:22.090 --> 22:24.885
<i>of the crime</i>
<i>of attempted aggravated kidnapping,</i>

22:24.968 --> 22:28.930
<i>you shall be sentenced according</i>
<i>to article 9, first section, paragraph A,</i>

22:29.014 --> 22:32.184
<i>and article 10, first section,</i>
<i>paragraphs A, B and C</i>

22:32.267 --> 22:34.186
<i>regarding kidnapping.</i>

22:34.269 --> 22:37.856
<i>Each of you will serve</i>
<i>three years and six months in prison,</i>

22:37.939 --> 22:39.107
<i>and 200 days as a fine,</i>

22:39.191 --> 22:41.109
<i>from the date this sentence</i>

22:41.193 --> 22:43.945
<i>is declared in force.</i>

22:44.029 --> 22:49.576
<i>However, the days you've been deprived</i>
<i>of your freedom pre-trial</i>

22:49.659 --> 22:51.286
<i>will be deducted.</i>

22:53.205 --> 22:57.501
"Did I hear correctly?"
"Three years, six months?"

22:57.584 --> 23:00.837
I looked at the lawyers
and they were like, "You're free!"

23:02.130 --> 23:06.218
We had already been in prison
for three years and six months.

23:06.843 --> 23:10.430
The sentence was short,
as to say, "That's enough now."

23:11.223 --> 23:13.975
Three years, six months,
and see you later.

23:14.059 --> 23:17.270
I was happy, yes, but I was also thinking,

23:18.063 --> 23:21.441
"But now I'll have a criminal record."

23:25.278 --> 23:26.363
Please.

23:26.446 --> 23:27.781
Thank you, guys.

23:27.864 --> 23:29.199
Bye, thank you.

23:29.282 --> 23:31.451
-Sorry, I'm sweaty.
-Thank you.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.036
-Excuse me.
-See you!

23:33.662 --> 23:35.038
It wasn't all pure joy,

23:35.122 --> 23:38.250
because we were expecting them
to walk out immediately.

23:38.333 --> 23:44.172
But we were comforted
thinking it would only be months now.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.049
Or days, let's say.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.884
<i>Mr. Juan Luis López García,</i>

23:47.968 --> 23:50.762
<i>Héctor Muñoz Muñoz</i>
<i>and Gonzalo García Hernández,</i>

23:50.846 --> 23:54.433
<i>do you have anything to say?</i>
<i>Any questions?</i>

23:54.516 --> 23:55.392
<i>No.</i>

23:55.475 --> 23:56.977
<i>-Sir?</i>
<i>-No, nothing.</i>

23:57.060 --> 23:57.894
<i>Sir?</i>

23:58.478 --> 24:00.647
Don't look down in shame!

24:01.314 --> 24:03.233
-Love you!
-They should be ashamed.

24:03.316 --> 24:05.402
-See you soon.
-Hold your head high.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.708
-Say bye.
-I love you.

24:19.791 --> 24:23.211
PRISON GUARD

24:31.261 --> 24:36.266
I think they saw that the evidence
was obviously in our favor,

24:36.349 --> 24:38.852
so their way of making it right was

24:38.935 --> 24:42.689
to sentence them,
and when the time to appeal is over,

24:42.772 --> 24:43.607
they can go.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.193
And that's what we did.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.403
Why fight,

24:48.487 --> 24:52.908
if the petition for appeal
will be a long process,

24:53.825 --> 24:56.995
when they are a couple of months
from being released?

24:57.078 --> 24:58.747
When it comes to my freedom,

24:58.830 --> 25:01.249
I want to be with my family, my son, now.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.250
So much time…

25:03.877 --> 25:06.546
they took away from me,
kept me away from him.

25:07.255 --> 25:09.132
I missed his childhood.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.134
Let's not appeal, let's just go.

25:11.218 --> 25:16.306
When they were sentenced
to three and a half years in prison,

25:17.182 --> 25:19.935
everyone was relieved and cheerful.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.145
"We won! They'll be out soon."

25:23.730 --> 25:26.816
But we saw the authorities
had malicious intentions.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.069
What worried me a lot

25:29.152 --> 25:33.156
was that I had personally approached
the State General Attorney of Tabasco,

25:33.240 --> 25:34.407
Fernando Valenzuela,

25:34.491 --> 25:37.410
to talk about the incident
with Andrés' van,

25:37.494 --> 25:38.870
and he hadn't investigated.

25:38.954 --> 25:41.164
He didn't investigate the incident.

25:41.248 --> 25:42.541
Nothing was done.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.918
The van disappeared<i>.</i>

25:45.001 --> 25:47.337
So I had a bad feeling about it.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.923
I think Andrés felt the same way.

25:50.006 --> 25:53.593
So both of us ended up leaving Tabasco.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.429
And the guys were left alone.

25:56.513 --> 26:02.519
Alberto Magaña continued working
on the case.

26:02.602 --> 26:05.480
Anyone would have left,
even if they meant well.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.524
"Fuck it, these bastards…"

26:07.607 --> 26:10.110
"I won't stay around
waiting to be killed."

26:10.193 --> 26:11.903
It's complicated, because…

26:13.989 --> 26:19.327
you try to detach yourself from emotions,

26:19.828 --> 26:21.454
because they affect you.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.082
But in the end…

26:24.916 --> 26:28.795
That day, that moment, was very tough.

26:28.878 --> 26:32.424
My four-year-old daughter
was desperately screaming,

26:32.507 --> 26:34.551
because she thought I was on fire.

26:35.468 --> 26:36.928
That was…

26:43.018 --> 26:45.145
And why did you stay for so long?

26:45.228 --> 26:48.898
Because someone has to act
to change this fucking country.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.339
We were one day away,

27:12.422 --> 27:15.967
and we thought, "That's it,
they won't appeal, we're free."

27:16.551 --> 27:18.428
We were so close to leaving.

27:19.638 --> 27:23.808
But on the very final day to appeal,

27:23.892 --> 27:25.560
the prosecution appealed.

27:25.644 --> 27:29.064
And one minute before time was up,

27:29.147 --> 27:33.026
and the time may already have been up,

27:33.109 --> 27:34.611
they appealed.

27:35.111 --> 27:38.490
By then,
Alberto Magaña and Andrés couldn't appeal.

27:39.074 --> 27:41.409
We were shocked. "Why?"

27:42.118 --> 27:43.662
"Why the prosecution?"

27:43.745 --> 27:46.748
It wasn't even the victim
that had accused them.

27:47.624 --> 27:51.294
It was the prosecution
presenting the appeal.

28:03.556 --> 28:07.185
APPEAL COURT

28:07.268 --> 28:09.020
They took us to court

28:10.563 --> 28:13.358
and the prosecution showed up immediately,

28:13.441 --> 28:17.237
and our lawyer, Juan Alberto Magaña.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.072
Andrés didn't come,

28:20.073 --> 28:22.158
because too much had happened here.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.202
They'd tried to kill him.

28:24.744 --> 28:28.873
So that day,
his colleague, Magaña, was there.

28:29.499 --> 28:34.254
So, without any real possibility
of defending them,

28:34.337 --> 28:36.840
Alberto Magaña went to the appeal hearing.

28:36.923 --> 28:38.550
He had to go to court

28:38.633 --> 28:42.095
and say that the sentence
was correct in the first place.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.765
What happened there is atrocious.

28:45.849 --> 28:50.562
<i>The defense considers</i>
<i>that the sentence was appropriate.</i>

28:50.645 --> 28:54.983
<i>The sentencing court correctly applied</i>

28:55.066 --> 28:57.485
<i>article 63.</i>

28:57.569 --> 29:02.532
The prosecution didn't give any evidence
to support the sentence they wanted.

29:02.615 --> 29:06.244
<i>This hearing is now over. Okay?</i>

29:06.327 --> 29:08.371
<i>And all parties,</i>

29:08.455 --> 29:12.584
<i>following what article 63 establishes,</i>

29:12.667 --> 29:14.544
<i>are now notified.</i>

29:14.627 --> 29:18.798
We all went home
and carried on with our lives.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.800
I thought, "This is on track."

29:20.884 --> 29:24.554
"We did our part,
we gave it our best effort."

29:24.637 --> 29:27.265
"These guys will be released

29:27.348 --> 29:30.018
in a couple of months."

29:30.101 --> 29:32.520
They brought us here again.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.649
Three days later,
we received a notification.

29:37.817 --> 29:41.112
"They're here to notify you
that you'll be out in days."

29:41.696 --> 29:42.989
God, the excitement.

29:43.573 --> 29:44.657
We were leaving!

29:51.623 --> 29:54.167
Juan Luis López García!

29:54.250 --> 29:56.419
Gonzalo García Hernández!

29:56.503 --> 29:58.296
Héctor Muñoz Muñoz!

29:58.379 --> 29:59.672
Come on, Leo!

30:00.673 --> 30:03.384
-Go, Leo!
-Come on!

30:05.136 --> 30:07.639
Gonzalo García Hernández!

30:07.722 --> 30:09.057
Nice, Villa!

30:14.270 --> 30:16.731
-Gonzalo!
-Juan Luis López García!

30:22.070 --> 30:23.822
We came down, excited.

30:23.905 --> 30:27.534
We were told, "You had a sentence
of three years, six months."

30:29.410 --> 30:31.830
"Your sentence now is 50 years."

30:33.498 --> 30:34.624
"What?"

30:36.417 --> 30:37.252
It…

30:39.420 --> 30:41.673
was just unbelievable.

30:42.465 --> 30:44.384
"What do you mean 50 years?"

30:52.350 --> 30:54.561
I pretty much froze.

30:55.144 --> 30:56.896
I was completely shocked.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.441
"What will I do here for 50 years?"

31:03.194 --> 31:07.407
We were being told,
"You are going to serve 50 years."

31:13.663 --> 31:17.750
At this point, I took it as…

31:17.834 --> 31:21.045
I didn't take it like…

31:21.588 --> 31:24.048
I told him "I just can't believe it."

31:26.926 --> 31:29.012
To me, it was devastating, because…

31:34.017 --> 31:35.393
seeing him…

31:38.229 --> 31:40.231
I can't even say anything,

31:41.524 --> 31:44.736
because although I try
to put myself in my brother's shoes,

31:45.236 --> 31:46.946
I'm not the one there.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.657
It was very tough for him.

31:49.741 --> 31:50.700
Very sad.

31:52.952 --> 31:54.829
So we signed the notice

31:55.788 --> 31:57.040
and went back inside.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.253
Each one to their cell.
We read, we talked for a while.

32:04.589 --> 32:05.798
Fifty years.

32:26.444 --> 32:29.489
<i>The one standing up</i>
<i>grabbed my head and hit me.</i>

32:29.572 --> 32:32.116
<i>"Don't even fucking move!"</i>

32:32.200 --> 32:35.328
<i>I told him, "I can't breathe. I can't."</i>

32:35.411 --> 32:39.332
<i>But they wanted me to say</i>
<i>something that wasn't true.</i>

32:39.415 --> 32:42.835
You have the right
to be detained before your executioner

32:42.919 --> 32:44.337
for 48 hours.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.422
That's what the Constitution says.

32:46.506 --> 32:51.344
That being detained for 48 hours
is our "right" is the most ridiculous trap

32:51.427 --> 32:53.680
you can ever think of.

32:53.763 --> 32:56.099
<i>I think there were a few of them,</i>

32:57.642 --> 33:00.812
<i>because one held my hands,</i>
<i>like this, subdued.</i>

33:00.895 --> 33:02.355
<i>One had his…</i>

33:03.272 --> 33:05.692
<i>his knee on my chest.</i>

33:05.775 --> 33:08.653
Within that time frame,
they get illegal evidence

33:09.445 --> 33:10.571
about another case.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.324
During those 48 hours, they torture you.

33:13.908 --> 33:16.327
<i>There was a row of bikes, and more above.</i>

33:16.411 --> 33:19.455
<i>They left me there, on my knees,</i>
<i>kind of hanging.</i>

33:19.956 --> 33:23.960
<i>Since I was taken there</i>
<i>until about five in the morning,</i>

33:24.669 --> 33:26.045
<i>I was kept there.</i>

33:26.754 --> 33:27.672
<i>On my knees.</i>

33:27.755 --> 33:30.341
<i>I didn't sleep, didn't drink any water.</i>

33:30.425 --> 33:33.302
When we put the public trial
as the main focus,

33:33.386 --> 33:38.433
we thought that just by carrying out
that methodology, a public trial,

33:38.516 --> 33:43.855
where the prosecutor's office
had to provide their evidence

33:43.938 --> 33:46.149
in a hearing that everyone could see,

33:46.232 --> 33:47.608
same as the defense,

33:47.692 --> 33:52.447
and where the judges had to decide
sentences right in front of us

33:52.530 --> 33:53.656
would change it all.

33:53.740 --> 33:58.911
But it's devastating to see
that the authoritarianism of the system

33:58.995 --> 34:01.414
is not reduced by having a public trial.

34:01.497 --> 34:04.751
It's not that the public trial reform
is a bad reform,

34:04.834 --> 34:07.628
it's just an incomplete reform.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.590
Now we need those ideas

34:10.673 --> 34:13.384
at the peak of the pyramid of justice

34:13.468 --> 34:14.927
to descend to the base.

34:15.011 --> 34:18.890
We need the police interviews
to be video recorded.

34:18.973 --> 34:21.392
Police operations should be recorded too.

34:21.476 --> 34:24.020
And we need to video record arrests.

34:24.103 --> 34:29.484
That will put an end to torture
as a method of criminal investigation.

34:29.567 --> 34:33.696
It would change the incentive structure
of the law enforcement officers

34:33.780 --> 34:35.114
and DAs, right?

34:35.198 --> 34:38.076
People would rather
have innocent people in jail

34:38.159 --> 34:42.580
as long as there are
some real criminals in there as well.

34:42.663 --> 34:45.124
The logic should be the other way around.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.251
It should scare us as a society.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.630
We should never accept
having innocent people in jail

34:50.713 --> 34:53.716
in order to catch guilty people,
no matter how many.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.259
It's not worth it. Why?

34:55.343 --> 34:59.722
Because if they understood
the dimension of this problem,

34:59.806 --> 35:01.933
they'd be afraid to leave their homes.

35:02.016 --> 35:05.269
You may be going to the shop
to get cigarettes,

35:05.353 --> 35:06.521
have an accident,

35:06.604 --> 35:10.983
and a police officer can charge you
with drug dealing, kidnapping,

35:11.067 --> 35:12.318
you name it.

35:12.401 --> 35:14.487
Don't forget that in the beginning,

35:14.570 --> 35:17.323
the Mexican criminal system

35:17.406 --> 35:20.701
was used
as a system for political control.

35:21.285 --> 35:25.081
A system for political control
is not designed to find the truth.

35:25.164 --> 35:29.919
And we never really changed
the roots of that original system.

35:30.002 --> 35:32.505
We modified rules, added the public trial,

35:32.588 --> 35:35.883
but there was never a political agreement

35:35.967 --> 35:39.053
to get politicians' hands
away from the system,

35:39.137 --> 35:42.306
and to use the system to find the truth.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.976
<i>After a while, they came back.</i>

35:45.059 --> 35:47.520
<i>Again, they put the bag on my head.</i>

35:49.438 --> 35:51.983
<i>I kept telling them</i>
<i>I didn't know those men</i>

35:52.066 --> 35:54.402
<i>they wanted me to accuse.</i>

35:54.485 --> 35:57.363
<i>I said, "How can I accuse someone</i>
<i>I don't know?"</i>

36:00.408 --> 36:05.037
1,914 DAYS IN PRISON
SEPTEMBER 22ND, 2020

36:05.705 --> 36:08.332
It had been two years since the sentence.

36:09.125 --> 36:12.712
In that time,
Tabasco elected a new government.

36:12.795 --> 36:16.174
Andrés Manuel López Obrador
won the presidential election.

36:16.257 --> 36:19.427
The world faced the COVID-19 pandemic.

36:21.262 --> 36:25.183
The pandemic we are going through

36:25.266 --> 36:28.060
has made everything more complicated.

36:28.144 --> 36:29.770
The courts were closed,

36:30.354 --> 36:33.107
and when they finally opened again,

36:33.733 --> 36:37.528
it was their usual vacation period,
and they took their vacations.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.739
There's no continuity.

36:40.573 --> 36:44.493
There's no coherence, I think,

36:44.577 --> 36:46.996
from the people who make these decisions.

36:47.079 --> 36:49.081
There are three people there,

36:49.999 --> 36:52.126
and, with them, many more innocents,

36:52.877 --> 36:55.338
that are waiting for the court to decide

36:55.421 --> 36:58.424
that they can finally go home.

36:59.091 --> 37:02.386
When someone shows you
who they are, believe them.

37:03.179 --> 37:07.808
And the prosecution office of Tabasco
has shown us who they are from the start.

37:08.309 --> 37:11.270
They act like they'll let you go,
then arrest you.

37:11.854 --> 37:14.398
"You'll be absolved soon,"
then you're not.

37:14.482 --> 37:16.859
I pretend I won't appeal, and I appeal.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.237
They play dirty.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.239
I've told you this.

37:21.322 --> 37:25.993
Releasing someone accused of kidnapping
has a huge political cost in Mexico.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.578
Even if they're innocent.

37:30.206 --> 37:33.125
All we have left
is a constitutional appeal.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.507
Yes. It's a difficult situation.

37:45.012 --> 37:48.307
I wonder how long that will take, though.

37:52.436 --> 37:56.357
All I can say for sure
is that it would take less than 50 years.

37:58.401 --> 38:00.152
That's for sure.

38:10.204 --> 38:11.205
Let's go.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.082
Thank you.

38:15.876 --> 38:17.003
Thanks.

38:18.129 --> 38:22.133
I promise you I will do everything I can

38:22.216 --> 38:23.592
to speed this up.

38:34.061 --> 38:37.231
Mexico has a very clear and logical rule:

38:37.315 --> 38:40.568
the State has to demonstrate
that you committed a crime.

38:41.068 --> 38:43.070
As a defense lawyer,

38:43.154 --> 38:46.324
you only have to prove
there's a reasonable doubt.

38:46.407 --> 38:49.493
You don't even
have to prove their innocence.

38:49.577 --> 38:52.288
However, it is clear and evident

38:52.371 --> 38:55.666
that courts operate
under the presumption of guilt.

38:55.750 --> 38:59.295
Because only when you assume
someone is guilty

38:59.378 --> 39:03.174
do you look for explanations
to help the prosecutors

39:03.257 --> 39:05.092
get their desired sentences.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.803
To me, it's extremely frustrating to see

39:08.387 --> 39:13.392
that district attorneys, police officers
and judges don't understand their roles.

39:17.813 --> 39:21.609
When I got out, I was ashamed,
because people would say,

39:21.692 --> 39:23.110
"That's the kidnapper."

39:23.944 --> 39:25.404
That's why I left.

39:26.906 --> 39:29.575
I decided to start a new life

39:29.658 --> 39:32.787
where I know nobody
is after me, nobody knows me.

39:33.579 --> 39:36.332
At home, I couldn't even sleep.

39:36.415 --> 39:39.710
When I saw the police, I hid from them.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.338
I was scared they would arrest me again.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.425
I don't know why I was stigmatized.

39:46.509 --> 39:47.968
I was declared innocent.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.643
We need a system
that is more sophisticated

39:56.519 --> 39:57.436
than this,

39:57.520 --> 40:01.482
where anyone can accuse you
of a crime, and you're sentenced.

40:02.108 --> 40:03.901
It's basic.

40:03.984 --> 40:06.070
We have the right to freedom.

40:06.737 --> 40:07.571
Don't we?

40:07.655 --> 40:10.741
In Mexico, that right is not guaranteed.

40:14.870 --> 40:17.706
This has affected me so much.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.293
Being away from my son, from my mom.

40:21.919 --> 40:23.504
And I'm scared that…

40:27.633 --> 40:30.553
when I finally have the chance
to get out of here,

40:31.137 --> 40:32.430
she will be gone.

40:33.139 --> 40:35.391
Everyone knows what really happened.

40:35.474 --> 40:39.478
And nobody wants to accept
that they are innocent.

40:39.562 --> 40:40.604
Why?

40:40.688 --> 40:42.982
That's what we don't understand. Why?

40:43.065 --> 40:45.443
This place affects you.

40:46.193 --> 40:47.570
That's the truth.

40:48.612 --> 40:52.283
You will never be the same,
because this is traumatic.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.661
It's 50 years. A lifetime.

40:55.744 --> 40:56.996
When you get out…

40:58.998 --> 41:02.293
there is no future anymore.

41:03.377 --> 41:06.046
Yes, it's been really hard.

41:07.006 --> 41:10.551
Some days,
I don't even want to get out of bed.

41:11.343 --> 41:14.305
But I have to go on, for my two kids.

41:14.388 --> 41:17.766
I always talk to Héctor
like everything is normal.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.810
I want him to think we're fine.

41:19.894 --> 41:20.811
But we aren't.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.855
At least, I am not.

41:22.938 --> 41:26.942
He thinks I am, because he says,
"For you it's easy, you're free."

41:27.818 --> 41:30.946
And I don't tell him,
"I'm free, but it's the same."

41:31.030 --> 41:33.324
"It's like I am…

41:34.200 --> 41:36.911
trapped in something, just like you."

41:40.247 --> 41:43.000
In prison, many things
go through your mind.

41:46.170 --> 41:49.131
You have so many thoughts,
you end up thinking

41:49.215 --> 41:51.133
you should do the easiest thing,

41:51.217 --> 41:52.635
which is hang yourself.

41:52.718 --> 41:55.638
I've thought about it.
I wanted to do it that day.

41:59.475 --> 42:01.185
You feel powerless.

42:04.813 --> 42:07.399
You want it all to be a dream.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.652
You want to wake up and say,

42:11.445 --> 42:12.696
"I'm home."

42:14.740 --> 42:16.492
Close to the people you love.

42:18.118 --> 42:19.495
But it's not like that.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.544
They ruined our lives.

42:42.851 --> 42:44.353
ON CONCLUSION OF THIS PROGRAM,

42:44.436 --> 42:47.648
HÉCTOR, GONZALO AND JUAN LUIS
HAD SPENT OVER 3,000 DAYS IN PRISON

42:47.731 --> 42:52.903
AND THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL APPEAL
WAS STILL PENDING.

42:53.988 --> 42:56.824
NONE OF THE PUBLIC SERVANTS
INVOLVED IN THE CASE

42:56.907 --> 42:58.701
WERE INVESTIGATED FOR TORTURE.

42:58.784 --> 43:03.372
MOST OF THEM ARE STILL WORKING,
WITH MORE POWER AND RESPONSIBILITIES.

43:03.872 --> 43:07.042
THANKS TO THE FAMILIES
OF DARWIN, GONZALO, HÉCTOR AND JUAN LUIS.

43:07.126 --> 43:10.087
EVA, MAYRA, MARINA,
JUANA, MIGUELINA AND YAZMÍN.

43:10.170 --> 43:13.674
TO MIGUEL SANSORES
AND THE TABASCO INNOCENCE PROJECT.

43:13.757 --> 43:18.762
TO THE LAWYERS
ANDRÉS ANDRADE AND ALBERTO MAGAÑA.

43:18.846 --> 43:21.807
TO IKER IBARRECHE,
WHO TOOK OVER THE DEFENSE FROM 2020.

43:21.890 --> 43:27.104
TO THE AUTHORITIES, GUARDS AND INMATES
WHO COOPERATED WITH FILMING.
