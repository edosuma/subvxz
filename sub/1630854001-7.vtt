WEBVTT

00:45.024 --> 00:46.793
Freeze!

00:55.311 --> 00:57.014
How are you?

00:57.081 --> 00:58.349
Terrified.

00:59.451 --> 01:02.157
He's out there right now,

01:02.224 --> 01:04.428
putting Elias's body somewhere.

01:09.806 --> 01:12.277
<i>They find it
sometime tomorrow morning.</i>

01:18.089 --> 01:20.628
<i>Coroner finds the note.</i>

01:22.031 --> 01:25.972
<i>And then, sometime tomorrow...</i>

01:26.039 --> 01:27.174
the cavalry comes.

01:29.513 --> 01:32.084
<i>I hit him with the pitcher.</i>

01:32.151 --> 01:33.453
<i>Stab him.</i>

01:34.556 --> 01:37.194
<i>And the cops blow his head off
his goddamn shoulders.</i>

01:38.697 --> 01:39.899
Okay.

01:39.966 --> 01:43.608
Or he's out there right now,
dumping the body,

01:43.675 --> 01:45.945
and as he rolls it
out of the blanket,

01:46.012 --> 01:47.983
my note comes out of his mouth.

01:48.050 --> 01:50.353
Then...

02:00.340 --> 02:02.278
Well, if that happens,
what are you gonna do?

02:02.344 --> 02:04.282
If he drives a knife
down my throat?

02:04.348 --> 02:07.656
I don't know,
die as quickly as possible.

02:07.723 --> 02:10.026
Well, I mean, your hands
aren't tied, are they?

02:10.093 --> 02:13.835
I just shoved a note
down a poor dead kid's throat.

02:13.901 --> 02:16.039
That was pretty good.

02:16.105 --> 02:18.076
I'm sorry I didn't use my skills

02:18.143 --> 02:19.746
as a mediocre
high school wrestler

02:19.813 --> 02:22.886
to beat a crazed killer
to death.

02:22.953 --> 02:25.691
Fuck you, Charlie. I got old.

02:25.758 --> 02:28.463
You've mentioned
your old age and your weakness

02:28.530 --> 02:29.967
several times already.

02:30.033 --> 02:31.570
It's pretty relevant.

02:31.637 --> 02:33.807
I agree.
We should talk about it.

02:35.177 --> 02:36.613
If nothing else,
it's probably

02:36.680 --> 02:39.151
the most interesting case
you've ever had.

02:39.218 --> 02:40.788
Uh-huh.

02:40.855 --> 02:42.893
I'll write a book.

02:42.959 --> 02:44.461
<i>Sam's Treatment.</i>

02:44.529 --> 02:47.535
There, I have the title.

03:00.762 --> 03:03.867
Have you ever heard of Kenny Chesney?

03:04.903 --> 03:06.005
No.

03:06.072 --> 03:07.576
He's a country western singer.

03:07.642 --> 03:11.015
Sam is very devoted to him.

03:11.081 --> 03:13.019
Goes to his concerts a lot.

03:13.085 --> 03:16.259
Has, I think,
a community of fellow fans.

03:16.326 --> 03:20.267
Alternate social world,
real but not,

03:20.333 --> 03:22.905
where he can be
like everyone else.

03:24.843 --> 03:27.414
I just had this dream.

03:27.481 --> 03:29.118
I was in a concentration camp.

03:29.185 --> 03:32.057
Auschwitz, I think.

03:32.123 --> 03:34.328
I walked into the barracks.

03:34.395 --> 03:37.234
These Jews were
reciting the Kaddish.

03:38.170 --> 03:40.273
Orthodox,
with all the stuff on.

03:41.943 --> 03:43.012
Okay.

03:43.981 --> 03:45.685
So I'm a Jew.

03:45.751 --> 03:48.791
I am trapped in the basement
with a killer.

03:48.857 --> 03:53.466
A killer who wanted to recite
the fucking Kaddish himself.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.441
I miss my wife.
Orthodox Ezra.

03:57.509 --> 03:59.445
It's all pretty obvious.

04:00.247 --> 04:02.451
Sometimes with an obvious dream,

04:02.519 --> 04:04.990
the question is less
the interpretation

04:05.057 --> 04:07.194
and more "what are you going
to do with it?"

04:07.261 --> 04:08.731
Mm.

04:08.798 --> 04:10.968
Are you gonna tell me
that I need to fight again?

04:11.035 --> 04:12.705
Got the point.

04:12.772 --> 04:14.308
No.

04:14.375 --> 04:15.912
What, then?

04:15.978 --> 04:18.016
The work.

04:18.082 --> 04:20.353
The work you've always done.

04:21.389 --> 04:24.028
Look into yourself, Alan.
Go ahead.

04:24.095 --> 04:27.903
Don't you want to
take the veils off?

04:27.969 --> 04:31.142
They aren't doing you
any good down here.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.684
I can't.

04:35.751 --> 04:37.220
You can.

04:37.287 --> 04:38.858
What's the point?

04:38.925 --> 04:40.460
Beth's dead.

04:40.528 --> 04:43.867
Ezra is in
a fucking religious cult

04:43.934 --> 04:45.671
and hates me.

04:45.738 --> 04:48.911
I'll probably be dead
by tomorrow.

04:48.978 --> 04:53.486
So, what do you want to do
with the day you have left?

05:07.982 --> 05:11.356
You're an adult.
You make your own choices.

05:11.422 --> 05:13.561
You're joining a cult.

05:13.627 --> 05:16.633
Well, I don't think you have

05:16.700 --> 05:19.572
an authentic relationship
with God.

06:23.567 --> 06:25.804
<i>Yitgadal...</i>

06:30.547 --> 06:35.023
<i>Yitgadal v'yitkadash
sh'meih raba.</i>

06:40.200 --> 06:43.507
<i>Yitgadal v'yitkadash
sh'meih raba...</i>

06:43.574 --> 06:45.678
<i>B'alma...</i>

06:50.722 --> 06:53.961
<i>Yitgadal...</i>

06:57.267 --> 06:59.204
<i>Yitgadal...</i>

07:06.820 --> 07:08.489
What are you doing?

07:09.258 --> 07:12.932
I was trying to recite
the Kaddish for my wife.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.805
I can't, I can't...

07:15.871 --> 07:17.675
I can't remember the words.

07:25.123 --> 07:26.993
I want to talk to you.

07:28.296 --> 07:31.469
It's been a long day and night.

07:31.537 --> 07:34.074
I'm exhausted.

08:07.407 --> 08:09.512
No hunting knife
down the throat?

08:09.579 --> 08:10.515
Not yet.

08:10.581 --> 08:12.317
It's good to be alive.

08:12.384 --> 08:14.021
Jealous?

08:14.088 --> 08:15.691
Are you ready?

08:15.758 --> 08:18.631
I'm too anxious right now.

08:18.697 --> 08:22.237
The body,
the note, waiting...

08:55.938 --> 08:58.510
Come on, you fuckers.

09:14.007 --> 09:15.343
Hey.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.485
Mr. Buchella.

09:19.552 --> 09:22.157
Wait, I remember you.

09:22.224 --> 09:23.492
Yeah, I'm Sam.

09:23.560 --> 09:24.863
Right, right.

09:24.930 --> 09:27.167
- Sam Fortner.
- Right.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.772
Right. Right, Sam.

09:29.839 --> 09:32.778
I-I didn't know
if you'd still be here.

09:32.845 --> 09:35.049
Yeah, still kicking.

09:40.293 --> 09:43.700
Hey, do you remember
when Mr. Schube was

09:43.767 --> 09:46.973
yelling and screaming in class,

09:47.040 --> 09:49.513
and he threw that chair,
and he almost hit Cindy Perez?

09:49.579 --> 09:53.019
And then you came in and asked
to talk to him in the hall?

09:53.988 --> 09:56.325
And then he came back
after you talked to him,

09:56.391 --> 09:59.298
and he told us he was sorry?

09:59.365 --> 10:01.936
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

10:03.106 --> 10:04.543
He didn't come back
the next year.

10:04.609 --> 10:06.145
Did you get him fired?

10:10.386 --> 10:11.657
Yeah.

10:11.724 --> 10:14.027
Yeah, I did.

10:16.031 --> 10:18.671
Well, it was good to see you, Sam.

10:18.737 --> 10:21.576
I've got to pick up my wife.

10:21.643 --> 10:23.847
I don't think my life is good.

10:25.684 --> 10:27.020
Oh?

10:27.087 --> 10:30.527
It's like it isn't working out.

10:30.594 --> 10:32.464
And I can't...

10:33.601 --> 10:38.543
It just isn't working out,
and I'm-I'm not happy.

10:38.610 --> 10:40.881
I-I don't know how to...

10:43.987 --> 10:46.258
Did you know this would happen?

10:47.193 --> 10:50.199
From what I was like,
when I, when I was a kid?

10:52.437 --> 10:54.241
No.

10:54.307 --> 10:56.513
No, not really.

10:56.579 --> 10:58.449
I'm sorry to hear it.

10:59.217 --> 11:01.924
I knew you were
a little different.

11:01.990 --> 11:04.729
You'd had a hard time.

11:04.796 --> 11:09.004
But you always hope
things turn around.

11:10.908 --> 11:13.112
Can you be my therapist?

11:14.849 --> 11:17.287
You're looking for
some counseling?

11:20.393 --> 11:22.130
Uh...

11:22.196 --> 11:25.469
Well, I don't know. Um...

11:25.537 --> 11:29.044
I've had some clients outside
of school over the years.

11:29.110 --> 11:32.919
But they were always, uh,
current students.

11:32.985 --> 11:35.423
But a former student?

11:38.195 --> 11:39.799
Maybe.

11:43.038 --> 11:46.045
Let me think about it, Sam.

11:46.111 --> 11:48.249
I, uh,

11:48.316 --> 11:51.723
I really do have to go
pick up my wife.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.739
Here's my number,
call me in a few days.

11:59.805 --> 12:02.010
Yeah.

12:03.413 --> 12:05.082
Hey, Mr. Buchella.

12:06.787 --> 12:10.527
What do you think about someone
living with their therapist?

12:11.830 --> 12:13.867
Could that help?

12:15.303 --> 12:18.208
That would not be a good idea.

13:14.856 --> 13:16.826
- You guys thirsty?
- Yes.

13:16.893 --> 13:19.130
Hi.

14:03.285 --> 14:04.656
Hello?

14:04.723 --> 14:06.526
<i>Hey.</i>

14:06.593 --> 14:11.836
<i>Did you ever think that there
was something wrong with me?</i>

14:11.903 --> 14:14.073
What do you mean?

14:14.140 --> 14:17.848
I don't know, just something...

14:17.915 --> 14:21.388
something that seemed wrong...

14:22.992 --> 14:25.029
...or different?

14:25.096 --> 14:28.503
You were my husband, Sam,
and then we broke up.

14:28.570 --> 14:32.310
I-I think there were all kinds
of things wrong with you.

14:33.078 --> 14:36.485
<i>Your whole life
revolves around food.</i>

14:38.055 --> 14:42.397
<i>I was never positive
you loved me.</i>

14:43.232 --> 14:47.842
I know you loved me,
but I mean...

14:47.909 --> 14:51.281
<i>loved, loved.</i>

14:52.752 --> 14:56.291
<i>But, overall,</i>

14:56.358 --> 14:59.130
<i>I know you're a good guy.</i>

15:00.701 --> 15:03.406
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

16:19.224 --> 16:21.461
Are you ready now?

16:42.003 --> 16:44.742
His damn father-in-law, Chaim.

16:44.809 --> 16:46.980
Who sits there putting stamps

16:47.046 --> 16:50.954
on envelopes and boxes
all day,

16:51.021 --> 16:53.660
when he's not reading
his Talmud.

16:53.727 --> 16:57.734
Ezra has chosen
this ridiculous life.

16:58.570 --> 17:01.041
He's left us all in the dust.

17:01.108 --> 17:04.549
That whole family, his in-laws,

17:04.616 --> 17:07.420
they are over at his house constantly.

17:07.486 --> 17:10.628
Helping with the kids,
waiting on them hand and foot.

17:10.694 --> 17:14.768
It's like they're all living
together in the shtetl.

17:14.835 --> 17:16.506
Whenever we visited,

17:16.573 --> 17:20.312
we were like
second-class citizens.

17:21.749 --> 17:25.624
We were somehow
not Jewish enough.

17:25.691 --> 17:30.300
Beth, who devoted her life
and career to Judaism--

17:30.366 --> 17:33.272
liberal Judaism, but still--

17:33.339 --> 17:36.144
she was not Jewish enough.

17:37.146 --> 17:40.085
And we smiled,
and smiled and smiled.

17:42.792 --> 17:45.430
When she got sick,

17:45.496 --> 17:48.435
he still couldn't get
past himself.

17:48.503 --> 17:51.174
Always had to have
the last word.

17:51.241 --> 17:55.517
She was lying there, in bed...

17:57.821 --> 18:01.428
...in so much pain,
spit coming out of her mouth.

18:01.495 --> 18:04.167
She wants to go out
on her terms,

18:04.233 --> 18:06.939
with her family around her.

18:07.006 --> 18:08.776
We got the pills.

18:09.745 --> 18:11.381
It's all ready.

18:11.448 --> 18:14.087
And you know what the fucker,

18:14.154 --> 18:16.325
the little fucker said to me?

18:16.391 --> 18:18.328
"It's illegal."

18:18.395 --> 18:22.170
Not just that it's against God,
but it's illegal.

18:22.236 --> 18:24.307
Like we're criminals.

18:24.374 --> 18:27.648
A-And he will have
no part of it.

18:27.715 --> 18:29.217
Judgmental.

18:31.088 --> 18:33.793
That day, the last day,

18:33.860 --> 18:37.233
she's lying there, he gives
his holier-than-thou speech,

18:37.300 --> 18:39.004
and he walks out of the house.

18:39.071 --> 18:42.210
And I go after him,
mostly just to talk to him.

18:42.277 --> 18:44.481
Trying to get him
to come back inside.

18:44.549 --> 18:47.454
"Don't-don't do anything that
you are going to regret doing

18:47.521 --> 18:49.057
for the rest of your life."

18:49.123 --> 18:52.063
And I get back this torrent.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.100
I never understood him.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.737
I was never there for him.

18:55.804 --> 18:58.543
I mistreated him
ever since he became Orthodox.

18:58.610 --> 19:01.315
I-I said the wrong thing
to the rabbi

19:01.382 --> 19:02.685
at his son's bris.

19:02.752 --> 19:05.423
I-I didn't give
a big enough donation

19:05.490 --> 19:08.129
to his fucking yeshiva
in Israel.

19:08.196 --> 19:10.867
I once said

19:10.934 --> 19:13.706
that his wife made
the best kosher steak

19:13.773 --> 19:15.142
that I had ever had.

19:15.209 --> 19:17.748
How about that?
I complimented his wife.

19:20.921 --> 19:24.060
I get that he was hurting.

19:24.127 --> 19:27.300
His whole life was
a rebellion against his mother.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.841
I support rebellions, obviously.
I get it.

19:30.908 --> 19:33.212
And his mother...

19:33.279 --> 19:35.249
there was a lot
to rebel against.

19:35.316 --> 19:38.221
A lot of individuating to do.

19:38.288 --> 19:40.126
But at a certain point,

19:40.193 --> 19:42.998
you have to come back around.

19:43.065 --> 19:44.802
You have to grow up.

19:46.471 --> 19:48.576
Well, it sounds as if

19:48.643 --> 19:53.018
with all the emotion and pain
swirling around Beth's death,

19:53.085 --> 19:55.857
Ezra hit a bad spot.

19:55.924 --> 19:57.928
You did, too.

19:58.764 --> 20:02.270
But we know these things pass.

20:02.336 --> 20:05.543
It didn't pass.

20:05.610 --> 20:09.685
That day, Beth wanted to die
with her family around her,

20:09.752 --> 20:13.727
and he had to throw
this tantrum.

20:14.896 --> 20:18.670
He was struggling to process
the pain of his mother's death.

20:18.736 --> 20:20.574
Okay. But he's always been
like that.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.179
He digs in,
and he can't see any other way

20:23.245 --> 20:26.384
but the way he sees things.

20:26.451 --> 20:28.956
No wonder he became Orthodox.

20:34.669 --> 20:37.808
I've been reaching out,
over and over.

20:38.877 --> 20:40.412
Nothing.

20:43.118 --> 20:46.257
I know grief can do this, but...

21:19.759 --> 21:22.397
I'm gonna print that prayer
you can't remember.

21:22.464 --> 21:25.236
From the Internet.

21:25.302 --> 21:27.641
I really appreciate that.

21:29.912 --> 21:34.755
And I want you to know
that is empathy in action.

21:34.822 --> 21:36.391
That is it.

21:36.458 --> 21:38.495
You put yourself in my shoes,

21:38.563 --> 21:42.871
you saw what I needed,
and you did it for me.

21:44.541 --> 21:47.547
Yeah. I just...

21:49.417 --> 21:51.087
Go ahead.

21:52.991 --> 21:55.062
Go ahead.

21:55.129 --> 21:57.667
I don't feel good.

22:25.088 --> 22:26.759
What kind of printer is it?

22:28.262 --> 22:31.669
Uh, Hewlett-Packard.

22:43.693 --> 22:49.037
Sam, it's been a difficult day.
Exhausting, probably.

22:49.104 --> 22:53.445
But I want to talk to you
about what's going to happen

22:53.512 --> 22:55.750
when they find Elias's body.

22:57.954 --> 23:00.927
I'm sure it will be on the news,
and you'll see it.

23:00.994 --> 23:05.069
And you're going to have
a lot of complicated feelings.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.340
I don't want to tell you
what those feelings will be.

23:07.406 --> 23:08.743
You'll have to tell me that.

23:08.810 --> 23:14.287
But I just want you
to be prepared

23:14.353 --> 23:17.727
to have a mix of feelings

23:17.794 --> 23:20.232
that I will help you
work through.

23:22.771 --> 23:25.643
It won't be on the news,
Dr. Strauss.

23:28.749 --> 23:31.789
I didn't do
what you told me to do.

23:31.856 --> 23:35.163
I was on the way to do it.

23:35.229 --> 23:39.170
I had a good spot picked out,
where they'd find him.

23:39.237 --> 23:41.107
But I was almost there,

23:41.174 --> 23:43.679
and this truck pulls up
next to me at a stoplight.

23:43.746 --> 23:48.088
And I can see the driver
just looking down

23:48.154 --> 23:50.359
into the bed of my pickup,
where, you know,

23:50.425 --> 23:52.363
the-the body was wrapped up.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.668
And I just...

23:56.404 --> 23:59.144
And I just thought,

23:59.210 --> 24:01.516
if this is on the news tomorrow,

24:01.582 --> 24:05.022
and that driver remembers
seeing something,

24:05.088 --> 24:08.295
remembers my pickup...

24:08.362 --> 24:10.900
So I-I didn't do it.

24:12.671 --> 24:14.875
I-I know it wasn't empathetic.

24:23.491 --> 24:26.030
What did you do with him?

24:26.097 --> 24:28.234
I put it somewhere.

24:29.638 --> 24:32.042
No one will find it.

24:41.327 --> 24:43.666
How do you pronounce it?
Kaddish?

24:43.733 --> 24:47.941
- Kaddish.
- Kaddish.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.771
Can I hear you say it?

25:04.508 --> 25:06.812
It's private.

25:46.859 --> 25:50.499
