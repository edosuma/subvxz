00:01.960 --> 00:04.400
[Chabsie] All right, boys,
come on, let's sort this.

00:08.520 --> 00:11.320
[Decoy] They've taken down
the fucking aerial, man!

00:11.360 --> 00:14.600
-[Chabsie] Oh, my God!
-[Beats] Surely that's wind
damage though, Decoy, right?

00:14.640 --> 00:17.520
[Beats] It's got to be wind
damage. It can't be Kold FM.

00:17.560 --> 00:20.560
Fuck's sake!
It's got to be wind damage.
What do you reckon, Chabs?

00:20.600 --> 00:22.720
-Erm...
-Definitely wind damage, right?

00:22.760 --> 00:25.560
Yeah, I don't think this is
done by wind damage, mate.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.680
Not unless the wind
used a baseball bat.

00:28.720 --> 00:31.880
[Beats] <i> Running your own</i>
<i>pirate radio station...</i>

00:31.920 --> 00:35.600
is a... it's a big
responsibility.

00:35.640 --> 00:40.160
<i>Being the leader's hard as
well and I really miss Grindah.</i>

00:40.200 --> 00:42.600
Cos I'm under a lot of stress.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.720
Well, it's pretty obvious
who done it, innit?

00:44.760 --> 00:46.560
Well, if it was
the fucking Kold FM boys,

00:46.600 --> 00:48.680
then we need an emergency
meeting now!

00:48.720 --> 00:50.720
This ain't a joke!

00:50.760 --> 00:54.360
I'm getting an M on the top
of my head from all the stress.

00:54.400 --> 00:57.920
-[director] You're going bald?
-Yeah. Well, my hairline's
going weird.

00:57.960 --> 01:01.560
I'm worried it's going
to turn into an island.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.080
Grindah would never
let himself go bald.

01:07.040 --> 01:11.640
Yeah, so, first time seeing
Miche since I've, erm...

01:11.680 --> 01:16.040
given up all the radio
and drugs and that, so, yeah.

01:17.320 --> 01:21.000
Trying to get it, like,
normal hair, sort of vibe.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.120
[director] Do you want
Miche to think you've changed?

01:23.160 --> 01:25.160
Course I want Miche
to think I'm changed.

01:25.200 --> 01:28.160
I want her to think, "Rah!"
like. "What's up with him?

01:28.200 --> 01:31.080
He definitely wants to get back
with me and he's making
an effort."

01:31.120 --> 01:33.440
Cos, like, there's this
thing called grafting

01:33.480 --> 01:35.720
that chicks are obsessed
with at the moment, yeah?

01:35.760 --> 01:38.040
And, like, what it means
is basically

01:38.080 --> 01:40.360
just doing things that
you'd never usually do,

01:40.400 --> 01:43.920
so that girl thinks
you've suddenly changed
into a better person.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.120
Like, to me, that's sort of
the modern version of romance,
do you know what I mean?

01:49.160 --> 01:52.920
-Square pasta sheets!
Mad, innit?
-Mm.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.920
-What you doing with my lasagne?
-I'm making Miche a lasagne.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.360
Yeah, nothing screams class
like a lasagne.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.560
-Well, get your own fucking
lasagne sheets, then.
-OK, cool.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.240
Do you want me to get back with
Miche and get out your house?

02:05.280 --> 02:07.560
-All right. Fair point, yeah.
-Yeah, thought so.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.960
-You need some stock cubes.
I'll show you where they are.
-Yeah, cool.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.400
[glasses clinking]

02:13.440 --> 02:17.680
Just going to pop
these down here.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.200
So, what are you going to say
to Daddy if he asks you
about the glasses?

02:21.240 --> 02:24.000
A crazy party you had
with your friends.

02:24.040 --> 02:27.400
Actually, maybe say dinner
party, it sounds a bit classier.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.600
When I was in a relationship,
I'd say I would prefer
to be in a relationship,

02:30.640 --> 02:34.160
but now I'm not in
a relationship, I'm loving
the single life, obviously.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.800
What else can we do to make it
look a bit more than just...?

02:37.840 --> 02:40.240
<i>It's, like, the freedom.</i>

02:40.280 --> 02:43.320
I can just watch what I want
on the telly. I can eat
what I want for dinner.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.280
It's a real breath of fresh air,
you know, just being alone,

02:46.320 --> 02:50.240
just with my own thoughts
and, yeah, just having
that bit of time for me.

02:50.280 --> 02:52.040
Miche time.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.840
Shall we just make it
look a bit more,

02:54.880 --> 02:57.400
like we've had fun?
Just... Yeah.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.240
Does that looks quite crazy?
Doesn't it?

03:00.280 --> 03:02.240
-Er...
-Tomatoes are at the top.

03:02.280 --> 03:05.040
Ooh, OK. Straight
from Italy, probably.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.720
-Probably.
-Yeah.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.480
Cool, have you got
a bag or something?

03:09.520 --> 03:12.440
You all right? You ain't
been picking up your phone.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.840
Did you hear that, Roche? It's
like a sort of hissing sound.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.360
Yeah, sounds like a tiny,
pathetic, little snake.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.080
Right, I am not getting
involved in any of this.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.760
I've got to get ready for work,
and don't forget you're looking
after Robyn today, innit?

03:24.800 --> 03:26.920
-See you later, darling.
-I'm looking after Robyn today?

03:26.960 --> 03:29.800
Yeah. You're looking
after that, right?

03:30.840 --> 03:33.160
Listen, man, I know we
ain't talking and that,

03:33.200 --> 03:36.080
but we got a major
fucking problem.

03:36.120 --> 03:39.200
The Kold FM boys
destroyed our aerial.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.000
<i>Me and Grindah aren't
chatting at the moment.</i>

03:42.040 --> 03:44.640
You know, when you break up
with your girlfriend
or whatever and you just...

03:44.680 --> 03:47.440
you can't, like,
eat and that, and...

03:47.480 --> 03:49.520
It's a bit like that, really,

03:49.560 --> 03:53.920
but with this doom of
Kold FM over my head.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.960
See you later, mate.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.320
See you later, Roche and Craig.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.640

-I'm up for sorting it,
definitely.

04:26.680 --> 04:29.680
-So you got a plan or what?
-Peaceful resolution.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.360
I do have a plan, Decoy.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.480
I've decided that
we should just...

04:35.520 --> 04:37.480
just snitch.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.480
No, I ain't no snitcher, man.
Not me, man.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.840
Yeah, me neither, man.
I'm not snitching.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.320
-I'll snitch.
-[Beats] Sweet, you can
make the call, Steves.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.320
-We're definitely not snitching.
-[Beats] Yeah, we're definitely
not snitching.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.920
-Steve, stop
throwing everyone off.
-Sorry, I just want peace.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.560
Their studio's near my estate.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.840
-So I'll see
what I can find out.
-Why didn't you say that before?

04:57.880 --> 05:00.040
Perfect, because I
actually hate snitching.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.000
OK, cool. You get the intel

05:02.040 --> 05:04.880
and then we can go down there
and maybe do a stakeout.

I'd just come and check in.
-Oh, that's nice.

06:12.720 --> 06:16.400
-You mean check in like that?
-I'm saying I'm doing my hair,

so Grindah and everyone else
can see how well I'm doing.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.760
-On Facebook?
-Exactly. Erm, Tanya,

06:21.800 --> 06:24.160
would you mind just pretending
to cut my hair for me,

a picture of it for my snap?
-Yeah.

Well, it's quite quiet.
Why don't we just give it
a trim anyway?

10:19.200 --> 10:22.840
Because I will crush everyone,
you know that, Angel, yeah?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.800
[Steves] Right, Robyn,
if that is your real name.

10:29.040 --> 10:32.520
Do you remember this?
That's you.

10:33.760 --> 10:36.280
"World's greatest grandma".

10:36.320 --> 10:38.720
Look at these,
you remember these?

10:38.760 --> 10:41.440
Your favourite, custard creams.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.560
Do you remember them?

10:43.600 --> 10:45.400
What about that?

10:45.440 --> 10:47.920
Jog any memories?

10:47.960 --> 10:49.760
Any flashbacks?

10:49.800 --> 10:52.600
<i>People are saying,
"Oh, you think your nan</i>

10:52.640 --> 10:56.800
came back as a baby, yeah,
that's... you're mad,"
or whatever.

10:56.840 --> 10:59.200
<i>But reincarnation's
a tricky one.</i>

10:59.240 --> 11:00.880
I've got an idea.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.720
<i>It's like if you're a butterfly,</i>

11:03.760 --> 11:05.880
and you see your
old caterpillar mate,

11:05.920 --> 11:08.240
and you're like, "Bruv,
what you saying? It's me."

11:08.280 --> 11:11.080
He might not recognise you,
cos he remembers you as
a caterpillar.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.200
<i>And it's the same with,
like, people. Like...</i>

11:14.240 --> 11:18.080
<i>you are evolving, you go
into the next body and...</i>

11:18.120 --> 11:21.920
<i>it's hard to keep track of
your old caterpillar mates,</i>

11:21.960 --> 11:25.520
if you're...a butterfly.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.960
I'm going to show you this...

11:31.240 --> 11:34.600
and I want you to tell me if
it's better with the glasses...

11:36.360 --> 11:38.480
or without the glasses.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.520
So, that's with.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.280
Or without?

11:46.800 --> 11:49.400
Shall we try it
one more time? With.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.440
Or without?

11:54.680 --> 11:56.720
It's inconclusive, I think.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.000
We'll have to try
something else.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.320
[Beats] Stakeouts are
way better in movies.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.880
Listen, Kev, mate, you
wouldn't know of anyone

12:10.920 --> 12:13.880
who kind of deals in kind
of short, substantial loans

12:13.920 --> 12:16.520
with kind of, like, minimum
paperwork, no ID or anything?

12:16.560 --> 12:18.680
Like, quick loans?

12:18.720 --> 12:22.400
No, the only person
I know is you.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.480
OK, listen, Kevin, what
I'm going to tell you
right now might shock you.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.040
-I'm bankruft. I need the loan.
-Shit.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.240
-I lost everything, mate.
I lost my restaurant...
-Fuck. Serious?

12:33.280 --> 12:36.800
Yeah. For the last two months,
mate, I've been living
in this van.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.480
You know what I mean?
I'm pathetic. I'm literally
a man in a van.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.360
It is kind of sick,
innit, though?

12:43.400 --> 12:46.640
I'd love this.
Like, no responsibility.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.760
It's like living in a caravan.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.160
You're a man of the road,
Chabsie.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.280
You're a road man.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.000
-Yeah, I guess I'm
a bit of a road man.
-You are, yeah.

12:56.040 --> 13:00.080
-You're living OG, off-grid.
-I am an OG, yeah.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.320
Kind of like nomad-style,
you know?

13:02.360 --> 13:05.720
-I'm not living by society's
kind of rules and that.
-Exactly.

13:05.760 --> 13:08.280
I'm like, kind of, just
doing what I want to do.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.440
-Driving where I want to drive.
Hair blowing in the wind.
-Why not?

13:11.480 --> 13:14.960
Shitting in a bucket.
Just living life like
I want to live life.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.520
You shit in a bucket?

13:17.560 --> 13:20.280
Shh, let's just concen...

13:20.320 --> 13:22.640
Keep your eyes peeled.

13:22.680 --> 13:26.840
Brentford girls on tour, yeah!
One night only!

13:26.880 --> 13:28.840
-Woo!
-Wheeey!

13:28.880 --> 13:31.040
[cackles] Love it.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.360
[Carol] <i> I want Miche to be</i>
<i>happy. That's all, you know?</i>

13:33.400 --> 13:35.640
I think she deserves
a really good man.

13:35.680 --> 13:39.000
But her idea of a good man
is someone with money
and chest hair.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.680
That's not necessarily true.
I can take or leave
the chest hair.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.960
I mean, Mick was very smooth,

13:45.000 --> 13:49.240
and that boy in Turkey
barely had armpit hair, so.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.400
<i>Listen, Miche...</i>

13:51.440 --> 13:54.440
-Yeah?
-You know what you said about,
like, Grindah and stuff?

13:54.480 --> 13:56.480
-Yeah.
-You are definitely
on your own, ain't you?

13:56.520 --> 13:58.760
-Yeah.
-There she is! Carol!

13:58.800 --> 14:01.360
-Mum, I don't...
-Right, mate, I've got
a little surprise for you...

14:01.400 --> 14:03.800
-No, Mum, please, please...
-Honestly, it'll do you good.

14:03.840 --> 14:07.640
-Listen! Honestly, a shag
would put a smile on your face.
-Please, please, Mum, no.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.800
-Hello, gorgeous. How are you?
-How you doing, babes?

14:09.840 --> 14:13.280
-Good to see you, babes!
-Right, I told you about him.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.640
-You must be Mateus?
-[Spanish accent] Matias.

14:15.680 --> 14:19.160
Matias! I love it!
So this is Miche.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.000
-Hello.
-You two have got
a lot in common.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.440
-You're both hairdressers.
-Very nice to meet you.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.680
You too... Ooh!

14:25.720 --> 14:28.160
-[laughter]
-I, er, I love your hair.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.480
Shut up! I look like
a disgusting freak!

14:30.520 --> 14:33.720
-We'll go and get a drink.
-Yeah, let's do that. Excuse me.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.760
-Mum, why are they here?
-Listen, I reckon he'd fuck you.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.320
You should give it a go,
all right?

14:41.400 --> 14:44.480
Right, it's nearly done.
Get on top of the cheese,
please, Angel.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.600
-OK, Dad.
-Teamwork, innit?

14:46.640 --> 14:50.280
Yeah, man is a responsible
man right now, innit, Ange?

14:50.320 --> 14:52.760
-Yeah.
-I tell you I quit blazing?

14:52.800 --> 14:55.280
Yeah. It's been quite
intense, actually.

14:55.320 --> 14:58.080
I can't find
the cheese grater.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.160
Cheese grater!

15:00.200 --> 15:02.400
Jesus Christ, these kids
don't know they was born.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.080
Angel, use this, yeah?
But cut it really small.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.200
-Thank you.
-OK.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.680
Ooh! This red sauce
is something else.

15:11.480 --> 15:14.520
Angel! A little bit faster,
all right, please? Thank you.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.720
Nice!

15:17.760 --> 15:19.800
-What's "candle" in Spanish?
-Candle is...

15:19.840 --> 15:22.480
That is, how you say, "vela".

15:22.520 --> 15:25.040
Ah! That's nice,
a nice name, isn't it?

15:25.080 --> 15:28.040
<i>"Vela en el viento",</i>
and this is like the song

15:28.080 --> 15:30.360
-"Candle In The Wind".
-Oh, I love that song.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.640
-I love Princess Diana.
-Yeah. This is from
Princess Diana?

15:32.680 --> 15:37.360
Yeah, yeah, she wrote it. How
do you say rose wine in Spanish?

15:37.400 --> 15:39.960
-Vino rose.
-[laughs]

15:40.000 --> 15:41.960
-Same again?
-Oh, yeah, please.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.680
OK, I get some drinks.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.720
Tell you what, mate,
he is cracking, isn't he?

15:45.760 --> 15:48.520
He's very friendly. Very good
at Spanish, actually, yeah.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.480
-He...he is Spanish.
-Mm, yeah.

15:50.520 --> 15:54.360
I've got an idea. Let's
settle this once and for all.

15:55.680 --> 16:00.120
Which of these do you prefer?
Nike jumper?

16:00.160 --> 16:03.640
Or... cream cardigan?

16:05.800 --> 16:08.480
Look, it's coming back.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.680
Remember these?
Do you remember these?

16:10.720 --> 16:13.840
Do you remember? Think.
Remember, remember.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.240
Remember who you are.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.760
Remember.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.160
Remember.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.760
Hey, look at that. Remember.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.400
Remember.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.280
Do you remember?

16:31.120 --> 16:33.000
Something's clicked.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.360
It's you, isn't it, Nan?

16:37.400 --> 16:39.280
It's her.

16:39.320 --> 16:43.560
[Chabsie hums]

16:47.600 --> 16:51.040
Kevin, Kevin! Over there, mate.
I see one male, yeah?

16:51.080 --> 16:53.520
Baseball hat, record bag,
five o'clock.

16:53.560 --> 16:55.440
Where's five o'clock?

16:55.480 --> 16:58.200
No, I'm just saying that's
the time. He's over there!

16:58.240 --> 17:00.560
-Look, look!
-Oh, yeah, I can see him.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.680
-Get out of the car,
follow him on foot.
-Why have I got to follow him?

17:03.720 --> 17:07.839
Well, I can't do it, man.
My whole style is based around
being noticed. I'm a peacock.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.920
Fuck's sake, yeah, that's true.
You're too flamboyant.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.599
All right. Chabsie...

17:12.640 --> 17:14.160
-Yeah?
-Cover me.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.000
What? You got a gun?

17:16.040 --> 17:17.839
No, man, it's just cos
we're doing the stakeout thing.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.240
-It's what people say, innit?
-Oh, shit. OK, cool.

17:24.839 --> 17:28.079
Kevin, clear!
You're covered on this side.

17:28.119 --> 17:30.440
Shut up!

17:30.480 --> 17:33.200
Oh, no, that's... Haa!

17:33.240 --> 17:35.880
-[front door opens]
-[Miche] Hi, there!

17:35.920 --> 17:38.720
Get some candles.
Miche, where are your candles?

17:38.760 --> 17:41.200
What? I thought you
were scared of candles.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.040
I wanted to put the finishing
touches on our little surprise.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.880
-It's our lasagne.
-Oh, did you do it
all by yourselves?

17:46.920 --> 17:49.600
-I did the main bit, but, yeah.
-Oh, looks lovely.

17:49.640 --> 17:52.920
Yeah, thank you. I was
thinking it might be nice

17:52.960 --> 17:54.600
if we could sit down
and get a...

17:54.640 --> 17:56.600
-[raucous laughter]
-Yeah...

17:56.640 --> 17:59.000
-You got people with you?
-Yeah, sorry.

17:59.040 --> 18:02.240
All right, muggins? Yeah,
you can go now. Playtime's up.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.720
Oh, that's funny.
How have you been, anyway?

18:04.760 --> 18:07.320
How have I been?
You on drugs?

18:07.360 --> 18:09.720
I've actually
given the drugs up,

18:09.760 --> 18:12.080
but thanks for
your concern though.

18:12.120 --> 18:15.360
-He's gone weird.
-He's making an effort, Mum.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.080
-Did you know they were coming?
-No.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.280
-Here we come!
-No big deal, yeah.

18:20.320 --> 18:23.960
Who's that prick?
See that guy in there?

18:24.000 --> 18:27.160
-Ask him who he is, what the
hell he's doing here, yeah?
-OK.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.080
-Oh, my Angel!
-Hola!

18:29.120 --> 18:30.360
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.080
Daddy says, "Who are you?"

18:39.920 --> 18:41.080
Shit!

18:43.320 --> 18:45.440
[ringtone]

18:45.480 --> 18:47.480
Yes, Kevin, mate.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.400
They've gone into the flat.
I don't know what to do.

18:50.440 --> 18:54.360
<i>OK, we need to make sure
it's definitely a pirate
radio station, yeah?</i>

18:54.400 --> 18:57.120
Yeah, not just some bloody
hipster with a cool bag.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.160
All right, stay on the line.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.520
OK, yeah. No, this is it.

19:05.360 --> 19:08.000
<i>So what are you hearing?
What are you hearing?</i>

19:08.040 --> 19:10.200
-[music plays]
-They're playing jungle,
old-school jungle.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.840
<i>-Jungle?</i>
-Definitely.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.680
<i>Oh, shit, mate.</i>

19:13.720 --> 19:16.720
-You all right, mate?
-Yeah, mate.

19:16.760 --> 19:19.560
Just looking for
my mate's house, mate.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.480
-Oh.
-Yeah.

19:21.520 --> 19:25.960
-Who's your mate, then?
-Erm... His name's...Barney.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.800
-What?
-Barney, you sent me to the
wrong flat again, you dickhead.

19:28.840 --> 19:31.320
<i>-Who's Barney?
Kevin, who's Barney?</i>
-Oi, Scott!

19:31.360 --> 19:34.200
-Mission abort!
-There's some geezer here
looking for your lad.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.960
Start the Merc!

19:36.000 --> 19:37.840
-Come here!
-Come back!

19:37.880 --> 19:39.960
Come here, you...!

19:40.000 --> 19:42.280
Eh! Oi!

19:43.800 --> 19:46.000
-Start the van up!
-What?

19:46.040 --> 19:48.800
-Please! Get in the van!
-Quickly!

19:48.840 --> 19:51.840
-[men shouting]
-Please!

19:51.880 --> 19:54.680
[Chabsie] This way, this way!
Go, go, go, go!

19:55.960 --> 19:57.960
-Please, Chabsie!
-Down there, mate!

19:58.000 --> 20:01.280
Me and Mum actually went to
Lanzarote, didn't we, recently?

20:01.320 --> 20:03.040
We did. Oh, we had a scream!

20:03.080 --> 20:04.880
Don't you show him
all those photos!

20:04.920 --> 20:07.160
Lanzagrotty,
some people call it.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.480
Just going to say, food's
nearly done if you want to...

20:11.800 --> 20:13.880
-You all right?
-Hello.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.560
-Hi.
-Yeah, just... Just saying...

20:16.600 --> 20:19.800
Just trying to call you from
there. You didn't hear me.

20:19.840 --> 20:23.120
-Food is nearly done,
so if you want to...
-OK, yeah.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.400
Why don't you make yourself
useful and go and get some wine?

20:25.440 --> 20:29.320
-Don't be rude, Mum.
-No, honestly, it's...
It'll be my pleasure.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.400
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Don't thank him.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.160
Being nice does get you places,
do you know what I mean?

20:34.200 --> 20:37.040
You lot just ain't seen it
from me, cos I am a nice person,

20:37.080 --> 20:40.000
but when I'm at Kurupt and
that, I've got to be bang
on the ball, on the ball.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.680
Carol, allow me.

20:42.720 --> 20:46.560
-Enjoy, enjoy! Yeah, sure.
-Thank you.

20:46.600 --> 20:50.720
<i>So with Miche, I've got
to be nice, because then
she'll realise,</i>

20:50.760 --> 20:53.040
<i>she'll be like, "Oh, is he
actually a nice person now?"</i>

20:53.080 --> 20:55.840
Little does she know that
I'm pretending to be nice

20:55.880 --> 20:57.720
just to get her back,
do you know what I mean?

20:57.760 --> 20:59.840
And that just shows how
much I care, I think.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.400
[Steves] Go on, then.

21:02.440 --> 21:05.080
This is all yours, look!

21:05.120 --> 21:08.760
Touch it.
That's all for you, that.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.360
My nan left a load
of money for me, erm...

21:12.400 --> 21:14.480
So I'm just sort of
holding on to it for her.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.640
You're rich for your age,
definitely.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.520
It's quite mad, actually,
how much money you got.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.040
Whatever she needs, I'll
get it for her, then once

21:23.080 --> 21:25.480
she's old enough to understand
money and reincarnation,

21:25.520 --> 21:29.240
I'll just sit her down and
explain exactly what's going on.

21:29.280 --> 21:32.480
-[men's voices]
-[Chabs] Tuck in! They're
going to see you, mate.

21:32.520 --> 21:36.520
-Tuck in, Kevin.
-Why won't they leave?

21:36.560 --> 21:39.400
-Oh, my God!
-Too young to die.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.880
They better not touch my Merc,
mate. She's all I've got left.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.440
[director] <i> Have you been</i>
<i>in a lot of fights, then?</i>

21:45.480 --> 21:48.800
I've had one fight, actually,

21:48.840 --> 21:52.240
at Education In Dance at
Brentford Leisure Centre.

21:52.280 --> 21:55.080
This girl threw
my cap off my head

21:55.120 --> 21:59.240
and then I said, "What are
you doing?" and she just
smacked me in the face.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.680
So after that I just allowed it.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.480
-Miche! Food's ready.
-All right.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.640
Oh, look at that!

22:09.720 --> 22:12.920
-Oh, wow!
-Eh! There you go!

22:12.960 --> 22:15.840
-My God, well done. Very good.
-Lasagne. In squares as well.

22:15.880 --> 22:18.160
You did the cutlery
the right way round as well.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.360
-I did, yeah.
-God, well done!

22:20.400 --> 22:23.840
I thought it'd be really nice...
Oh, you're eating, are you?

22:23.880 --> 22:26.880
I thought it was maybe just...

22:26.920 --> 22:30.720
I thought it might be nice
for us two to catch up.

22:30.760 --> 22:34.120
Sorry, can I...?
Can I just...?

22:34.160 --> 22:36.560
-Yeah.
-Thanks, mate. Get a drink.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.880
-Oh.
-Thank you very much.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.160
-No worries.
-Perfect!

22:44.680 --> 22:46.760
I think they've gone
back to their station.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.840
OK, just act normal, act normal.
Nothing's wrong, act normal.

22:49.880 --> 22:52.640
I can't believe
we just snitched, man.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.880
-Listen, Kevin, mate, mate...
-I'm shaking.

22:54.920 --> 22:57.240
We did what we had to do.

22:57.280 --> 22:59.920
All right? I mean, technically,
you did it, but... we did it.

22:59.960 --> 23:02.840
Look, man, we can't tell
anyone about that, literally.

23:02.880 --> 23:06.680
Like, no one needs to know,
like. It's embarrassing.

23:06.720 --> 23:10.120
-How much not to talk?
-What do you mean,
"How much not to talk"?

23:10.160 --> 23:13.680
If you tell anyone, I'll tell
them you live in a shitty
Renault and shit in a bucket.

23:13.720 --> 23:17.120
-It's a Merc.
-It's a Renault.

23:18.320 --> 23:21.360
Come on, man,
we got to get out of here.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.480
-[drunken laughter]
-Oh, no!

23:25.760 --> 23:30.320
[laughter and drunken chat]

23:30.360 --> 23:32.800
-I've got one for you.
-Miche, Miche!

23:32.840 --> 23:35.080
[Miche] <i> Love makes you</i>
<i>do stupid things.</i>

23:35.120 --> 23:38.240
You can't describe it, can
you? It's this beautiful thing

23:38.280 --> 23:40.360
<i>that just hits you
and you can't stop it,</i>

23:40.400 --> 23:43.400
<i>and it's, like, filling your
body and you want it to go away</i>

23:43.440 --> 23:45.000
<i>cos you feel uncomfortable
and scared,</i>

23:45.040 --> 23:47.080
but you also want it
to stay there, cos...

23:47.120 --> 23:50.080
It's almost like you could phone
in sick and lie in bed all day.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.160
It's sort of like being ill.

23:52.200 --> 23:55.240
-Bye, cheers!
Thanks for the lasagne.
-Oh, right, no...

23:55.280 --> 23:59.600
-Yeah, my pleasure. Yeah!
-Erm, Mitch, do you want
to take my number?

23:59.640 --> 24:03.960
-Just in case you want
to meet again maybe.
-Sorry, I just... Er...

24:04.000 --> 24:07.040
I don't know if I'm in a place
where I can do that right now.

24:07.080 --> 24:09.600
Ah. OK, but, erm...

24:11.080 --> 24:13.720
Well, you know, obviously, like,
with the language barrier
and everything,

24:13.760 --> 24:15.480
you know, it might not really...

24:15.520 --> 24:18.480
-But I'm speaking English.
-Yes, yeah, so...

24:18.520 --> 24:21.240
-OK, OK.
-No, you too, yeah!

24:26.480 --> 24:28.920
[dance music plays]

24:30.240 --> 24:32.040
Love this one.

24:37.680 --> 24:38.960
Hello?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.280
Hello?

24:40.320 --> 24:42.520
-Man.
-Yes, brother.

24:42.560 --> 24:45.960
-Shaking, man.
-What happened?
Did you find Kold FM?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.600
Yeah, we... sorted it.

24:48.640 --> 24:51.080
What happened?

24:51.120 --> 24:53.600
Just... Look, it's sorted.

24:53.640 --> 24:56.000
Did you beat the shit
out of them?

24:56.040 --> 24:57.920
Yeah, course.

24:57.960 --> 25:01.640
-Can I see your knuckles?
-No, I already washed them.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.400
Clean.

25:03.440 --> 25:05.360
[director] <i> So what</i>
<i>happened with Kold FM?</i>

25:05.400 --> 25:08.280
Need-to-know basis, mate.

25:08.320 --> 25:12.160
Let's say that if someone cut
down a tree in a forest, yeah,

25:12.200 --> 25:15.200
and no one was there
to see it,

25:15.240 --> 25:18.320
did it even matter
or did it even happen?

25:18.360 --> 25:22.000
Let's not point fingers
about who called the
tree surgeon or whatever,

25:22.040 --> 25:24.600
let's just keep it moving.

25:24.640 --> 25:28.440
That's what happens.
That's what happens
when you mess with Kurupt FM.

25:28.480 --> 25:32.080
-Innit?
-Yep.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.120
Ah, don't...

25:34.160 --> 25:36.320
fuck with us.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.440
God, that Matias was
a bit sleazy, wasn't he?

25:41.480 --> 25:45.600
I dunno, he was all right.
Isn't that the stuff that
we use on the cushions?

25:45.640 --> 25:49.840
Yeah, but also good on
washing up and that, so...

25:49.880 --> 25:52.080
It's an old wives' tale
sort of thing.

25:52.120 --> 25:55.480
OK, yeah. Right, well, I'll
let you get on with that.

25:55.520 --> 25:58.000
OK, yeah.
You go put your feet up.

26:03.880 --> 26:07.160
[Grindah] <i> They say absence</i>
<i>makes the heart grow fonder</i>

26:07.200 --> 26:10.560
<i>and if you love someone
then let them go, but...</i>

26:10.600 --> 26:14.400
it's bollocks, really, innit?
If you love someone, then
be around them all the time

26:14.440 --> 26:16.160
to remind them that you're
better than anyone else.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.040
<i>And show them that
you're the perfect man.</i>

26:19.080 --> 26:21.960
[vacuum cleaner whirs]

26:28.720 --> 26:31.280
Thought I'd give the place
a little once-over.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.640
Yeah, don't worry about it.
It's fine. It's a bit late.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.960
-Angel's asleep, so let's...
-It's all good.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.120
-I'll bang it out real quick.
-Did you want
a little bit of this?

26:39.160 --> 26:41.640
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.600
Fuck it,
old times' sake, innit?

26:43.640 --> 26:46.680
Yeah, and don't worry about
doing any more cleaning.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.280
Honestly, I just
wanted to finish this

26:49.320 --> 26:51.400
and then I'll make a start
on the inside of the oven.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.720
Oh, no, no. Seriously,
you've done enough.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.360
You don't need to do any more.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.280
-I've done enough?
-Yeah.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.560
Cool, well...

26:59.600 --> 27:02.240
unless you wanted to...

27:02.280 --> 27:05.160
-No...
-Yeah, I know. I'll shoot off.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.680
-Cool, yeah.
-You just... Yeah, get home.
Get home safe, and... Yeah.

27:08.720 --> 27:11.200
-I will.
-I'll see you next week, yeah?

27:11.240 --> 27:12.760
See you later, Miche.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.320
Did you hear that?

27:18.360 --> 27:20.480
She said I'd done enough.

27:21.760 --> 27:25.000
Well...
See you fuckers in a bit!

27:26.320 --> 27:30.160
[Beats] Daddy got home safe,
little Robyn. Sweet dreams.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.400
[Roche] Kevin?

27:32.600 --> 27:34.400
Have you got any idea

27:34.440 --> 27:38.200
why there is four grand
stuffed into Robyn's baby bag?

27:39.240 --> 27:41.840
-Look at that!
-I'll give it back to him
tomorrow.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.680
Yeah, please do.

27:43.720 --> 27:46.160
Steves thinks
it's Robyn's money.

27:46.200 --> 27:50.040
I might take a score,
just for a rainy day.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.360
-For Robyn?
-For Robyn, yeah.

27:52.400 --> 27:56.840
Yeah, go on, then. Yeah, get
one for me, too, for Robyn.

27:58.120 --> 28:00.200
There you go, mate.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.720
Make sure that you give it
back to him tomorrow, yeah?
