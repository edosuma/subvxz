WEBVTT

00:04.237 --> 00:06.569
I got no legroom back here.
Move your seat forward.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.105
It's as far as it goes.

00:08.274 --> 00:11.573
There's a mechanism. You just pull it
and throw your body weight.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.906
I pulled it, it doesn't go.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.572
If you want the legroom, say you want
the room. Don't blame the mechanism.

00:17.751 --> 00:21.187
All right, Dad, we're five blocks
from the house. Sit sideways.

00:21.354 --> 00:24.118
Like an animal. Because of her,
I have to sit like an animal.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.884
Serenity now! Serenity now!

00:27.060 --> 00:28.550
What is that?

00:28.728 --> 00:30.753
Doctor gave me
a relaxation cassette.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.625
When my blood pressure
gets too high...

00:32.799 --> 00:35.791
...the man on the tape tells me to say,
"Serenity now."

00:36.169 --> 00:37.693
Are you supposed to yell it?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.964
The man on the tape
wasn't specific.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.539
What happened to the screen door?
It blew off again?

00:43.710 --> 00:45.735
I told you to fix that thing.

00:45.912 --> 00:48.278
Serenity now!

00:53.920 --> 00:57.651
I told Bobby and Lisa we'd try that new
Chinese-Spanish place on Saturday.

00:57.824 --> 00:59.951
Thought we had tickets
to the Knicks home opener.

01:00.126 --> 01:03.061
Well, I thought this would be more fun
so I gave the tickets away.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.060
What?

01:05.230 --> 01:06.994
All right, fine.

01:07.333 --> 01:08.823
Are you mad at me?

01:09.002 --> 01:13.234
No, I love a good Chinese-Spanish
whatever it is.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.569
You know, I've never seen you mad.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.732
I get peeved.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.503
-Mad.
-Miffed.

01:19.679 --> 01:21.306
-Mad.
-Irked?

01:22.082 --> 01:25.677
I would like to see you
get really mad.

01:29.155 --> 01:30.884
Why does she want you to be mad?

01:31.057 --> 01:32.752
She says I suppress my emotions.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.689
So, what do you care
what she thinks?

01:35.562 --> 01:37.325
Good body.

01:38.231 --> 01:40.631
She probably gets that impression
because you're cool.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.236
You're under control. Like me.
Nothing wrong with that.

01:44.737 --> 01:47.535
But I get upset. I've yelled.
You've heard me yell.

01:47.707 --> 01:50.835
Not really. Your voice kind of raises
to this comedic pitch.

01:51.978 --> 01:53.206
Hey.

01:53.379 --> 01:56.610
Kramer, I am so sick of you coming
in here and eating all of my food.

01:56.783 --> 02:00.014
Now, shut that door
and get the hell out of here.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.657
What is that, a new bit?

02:09.429 --> 02:10.453
I told you.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.963
Any of you wanna come and help me
fix my father's screen door in Queens?

02:14.134 --> 02:16.364
Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door
in the Bronx.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.764
-I'll do it.
-Really, you wanna come?

02:18.938 --> 02:20.803
Yeah, I love going to the country.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.471
-Where are they going?
-Fix a screen door in Queens.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.480
That's funny.

02:32.785 --> 02:34.582
Hey, listen,
what are you doing Saturday?

02:34.754 --> 02:36.381
Not going to the Knick game.

02:36.890 --> 02:40.018
I need somebody to go with me
to Mr. Lippman's son's bar mitzvah.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.889
You know, if you don't bring a guest,
they save on catering.

02:43.062 --> 02:47.465
-Should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
-Oh, I don't think that's possible.

02:51.838 --> 02:55.433
And get a little closer
because I can't see the screen door.

02:55.642 --> 02:57.473
Yeah.

02:58.077 --> 03:00.875
-Perfect.
-Dad, the hinges are all rusted here.

03:01.047 --> 03:03.106
That's why the wind keeps blowing
the door off.

03:03.283 --> 03:06.719
I hate that old door. Throw it out!

03:06.886 --> 03:09.013
Serenity now.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.181
Might be time to just let her go, Frank.
She's worked hard for you.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.417
-Will you put her to rest for me?
-Oh, yeah.

03:14.594 --> 03:16.960
-I'll take good care of her.
-Okay.

03:23.102 --> 03:27.562
And get George to put those boxes
in the garage.

03:28.341 --> 03:31.105
-Dad, what is all this?
-It's junk.

03:31.277 --> 03:34.474
My computers. I've been selling them
for two months now.

03:34.647 --> 03:36.171
Shut up.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.775
You're selling computers?

03:39.319 --> 03:43.085
Two months ago, I saw
a provocative movie on cable TV.

03:43.256 --> 03:46.953
It was called <i>The Net</i>,
with that girl from the bus.

03:47.260 --> 03:52.391
I did a little reading and I realized
it wasn't that far-fetched.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.898
Dad, do you know what it takes
to compete with Microsoft and IBM?

03:56.069 --> 03:58.902
Yes, I do.
That's why I've got a secret weapon.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.308
My son.

04:06.212 --> 04:09.739
Damn it, they gave me cream.
I asked for nonfat milk.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.976
I think they have one percent
over there.

04:13.152 --> 04:17.748
One percent?
They can kiss one percent of my ass.

04:18.423 --> 04:21.086
Okay, Jerry, enough.
I'm not buying it.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.627
You're damn right
you're not buying it.

04:24.530 --> 04:27.499
You shouldn't have to try.
It's just being open.

04:27.667 --> 04:31.103
I'm open.
There's just nothing in there.

04:32.705 --> 04:34.605
-Oh, you think I'm lying?
-I think you are.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.639
-Well, I'm not.
-Yes, you are. Liar.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.436
-Oh, stop it.
-Okay, liar.

04:38.611 --> 04:39.669
That's enough.

04:39.979 --> 04:41.105
That was good.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.215
Really? It felt good.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.380
Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.

04:46.853 --> 04:47.842
Oh, Elaine.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.522
My boy's a man today.
Can you believe it?

04:51.691 --> 04:55.855
-He's a man.
-Oh, congratulations, Adam.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.462
I'm a man.

05:06.406 --> 05:08.806
-Tongue?
-Yeah.

05:12.478 --> 05:15.208
I didn't try that till I was 23.

05:15.682 --> 05:18.480
Well, this kid's not just a man,
he's a man's man.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.150
And I think he's been telling
his friends.

05:21.321 --> 05:25.155
I got invitations
to six more bar mitzvahs.

05:26.693 --> 05:30.959
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld.
No. No. No.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.621
I do not wanna stop over
in Cincinnati.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.961
Well, then you upgrade me.

05:36.135 --> 05:40.071
That's right, you should thank me.
Goodbye.

05:40.239 --> 05:42.571
Hey, I'm flying first class.

05:42.942 --> 05:44.375
Where did that come from?

05:44.544 --> 05:46.535
Patty showed me how to get mad.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.374
You got a problem with that?

05:49.482 --> 05:51.074
-No.
-Good.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.275
All right, relax, tough guy.

05:53.453 --> 05:56.251
I gotta get out to my father's garage.
Help him sell computers.

05:56.422 --> 06:00.051
The two of you working in that garage
is like a steel-cage death match.

06:05.164 --> 06:06.529
-Kramer?
-Yeah.

06:06.699 --> 06:07.927
What are you doing?

06:08.101 --> 06:10.228
Oh, I'm putting up Frank's
screen door.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.394
This beauty has got a little life
in her yet.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.039
What do you need it for?

06:14.207 --> 06:17.608
The cool evening breezes
of Anytown, U.S.A.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.042
See how this baby closes.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.281
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:25.818 --> 06:28.480
-Morning, Ma.
-You're late.

06:30.857 --> 06:32.882
-Morning, Dad.
-I'm not Dad in the work place.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.754
My professional name
is Mr. Costanza...

06:34.927 --> 06:37.020
...and I will refer to you
as Costanza.

06:37.196 --> 06:39.096
-Morning, Braun.
-Hey, George.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.292
Two cream, no sugar.

06:43.469 --> 06:45.403
What is Lloyd Braun doing here?

06:46.239 --> 06:48.673
-Your mother recommended him.
-Yeah, of course she did.

06:48.841 --> 06:50.206
All I ever heard growing up is:

06:50.376 --> 06:52.276
"Why can't you be more like
Lloyd Braun?"

06:52.445 --> 06:54.242
You know he was in
a mental institution?

06:54.614 --> 06:56.275
I didn't read his résumé.

06:58.184 --> 07:01.483
Another sale, Mr. Costanza.
Chalk me up on the big board.

07:04.023 --> 07:07.288
-What is this?
-This is your lagging.

07:07.460 --> 07:11.260
-Good work, Braun.
-Good for you, Lloyd.

07:13.499 --> 07:17.936
So, Adam, I just talked to your father
and apology accepted.

07:18.304 --> 07:22.673
I'm not apologizing. It was great.
I told everyone.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.177
Yeah, I know.
By the way, could you do me a favor...

07:26.345 --> 07:30.941
...and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that
I'll be unable to attend this Saturday?

07:31.384 --> 07:32.942
Are you free Friday night?

07:34.587 --> 07:37.420
I am, but that is not the point.

07:37.590 --> 07:42.789
You are 13
and I am in my early 20s.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.523
But I'm a man. The rabbi said so.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.029
No, you are not a man.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.430
It takes a long time
to become a man.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.900
I mean, half my friends
aren't even there yet.

07:53.339 --> 07:57.139
Well, if I'm not a man,
then this whole thing was a sham.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.335
First he said
I was gonna get great gifts...

07:59.512 --> 08:01.571
...and then somebody
gives me Boggle.

08:02.849 --> 08:05.317
-I renounce my religion.
-Who wants cookies?

08:05.485 --> 08:08.716
As of this moment,
I am no longer Jewish. I quit.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.888
Walnuts.

08:13.926 --> 08:15.757
You're late again, Costanza,
so listen up.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.396
Starting tonight,
we're having a little sales contest.

08:19.565 --> 08:22.591
The loser gets fired,
the winner gets a Waterpik.

08:22.768 --> 08:25.498
You're not giving away
our Waterpik!

08:25.671 --> 08:27.104
Serenity now.

08:27.273 --> 08:30.538
You know what?
It doesn't matter, because I quit.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.075
I guess your mother was right.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.770
You never could compete
with Lloyd Braun.

08:39.385 --> 08:43.549
You want to sell computers?
I will show you how to sell computers.

08:48.494 --> 08:51.554
Hello, Mr. Finerman.
You wanna buy a computer?

08:51.731 --> 08:54.291
No? Why not?

08:55.468 --> 08:58.437
All right, I see.
Good answer. Thank you.

09:01.941 --> 09:04.409
Serenity now!

09:06.479 --> 09:09.312
Adam, you don't become a man
overnight.

09:09.482 --> 09:14.419
Look at your father. It takes time,
patience, experience...

09:14.587 --> 09:18.045
...several careers
of varying success.

09:18.224 --> 09:21.751
These are things
that I look for in a man.

09:21.928 --> 09:26.388
Well, that does me a lot of good.
"Early 20s."

09:27.633 --> 09:29.931
Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.

09:30.102 --> 09:33.003
So that's the type of guy
you're looking for?

09:33.172 --> 09:35.902
I guess so. Why?

09:39.745 --> 09:43.772
-What is this?
-Anytown, U.S.A.

09:45.518 --> 09:48.510
Hello. Is Kramer home?

09:48.688 --> 09:50.417
Oh, hey.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.482
Hello, neighbor.

09:52.658 --> 09:54.751
Boy, those azaleas
are really coming in nicely.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.589
Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.926
-You barbecuing tonight?
-Right after the fireworks.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.699
So where do you wanna eat tonight?

10:09.875 --> 10:11.467
How about going back
to La Caridad?

10:11.644 --> 10:15.944
Again?
How much flan can a person eat?

10:16.248 --> 10:18.842
Jerry, you've been yelling at me
all afternoon.

10:19.018 --> 10:22.385
Well, I don't think more flan
is the answer.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.648
-Maybe I should just leave.
-Maybe?

10:24.824 --> 10:27.520
-Goodbye.
-Double goodbye.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.391
Hey, buddy.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.363
Hey, happy New Year.

10:36.535 --> 10:39.003
Y'all come back real--

10:42.808 --> 10:44.742
-Did you and Patty just break up?
-Yeah.

10:44.910 --> 10:49.108
In fact, she broke up with me.
And I don't wanna talk about it.

10:50.483 --> 10:55.147
Then you're free tonight. I heard about
this great place called La Caridad.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.849
That's the last thing she said to me.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.993
She wanted to go there also,
but I wasn't in the mood.

11:01.160 --> 11:04.994
-Oh, what is the matter?
-It's Patty.

11:05.164 --> 11:08.327
Jerry, you break up with a girl
every week.

11:12.938 --> 11:15.099
What is this salty discharge?

11:16.742 --> 11:19.438
Oh, my God, you're crying.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.603
This is horrible.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.348
I care.

11:29.922 --> 11:33.517
Patty won't call me back.
I don't know if I can live without her.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.558
She's really gotten to you,
hasn't she?

11:35.728 --> 11:37.992
-I don't know what's happening to me.
-It's simple.

11:38.164 --> 11:41.622
You let out one emotion,
all the rest will come with it.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.962
It's like Endora's box.

11:44.136 --> 11:47.594
That was the mother on <i>Bewitched.</i>
You mean Pandora.

11:47.773 --> 11:50.742
Yeah, well, she had one too.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.570
Jerry, can I talk to you for a minute?

12:01.487 --> 12:03.955
That's it. That's it,
I warned you kids.

12:04.123 --> 12:06.284
I told you not to play in front
of my house.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.950
This time, I'm keeping it.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.625
And you're not getting your rock
back either.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.629
Hall urchins.

12:18.804 --> 12:22.137
Are you still down in the dumps?
Come on, it's just a chick.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.469
You ever heard of a little thing
called feelings?

12:24.643 --> 12:27.111
Well, I got just the thing
to cheer you up.

12:27.279 --> 12:29.304
A computer.

12:30.049 --> 12:32.916
You could check porn
and stock quotes.

12:34.353 --> 12:35.980
Porn quotes.

12:36.155 --> 12:38.646
I'm so lucky to have
a friend like you, George.

12:39.825 --> 12:42.020
I ever tell you how much I love you?

12:46.565 --> 12:49.898
-What?
-I love you, George.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.833
-Come here.
-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here.

12:53.005 --> 12:55.599
You know what, if you want
a computer, call me. I gotta go.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.573
Go wherever you want,
I'm still gonna love you.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.409
Look what they did.
Look what they did to my house.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.070
I turn my back for two seconds...

13:03.249 --> 13:05.444
...and they put shaving cream
all over the door.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.381
Yeah, I see you!

13:07.553 --> 13:09.214
I'm gonna teach these kids
a lesson.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.288
Where's that hose
I put under your sink?

13:11.457 --> 13:13.948
Hose under my sink.
I love you, Kramer.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.720
-I love you too. And George--
-I don't wanna hear it.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.729
When I give you the signal,
turn this water on full blast.

13:19.899 --> 13:23.300
-Signal? What signal?
-I don't know, I'll yell hoochie mama.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.869
All right, if I do it,
will you buy a computer?

13:26.038 --> 13:27.699
On the signal, George.
On the signal.

13:27.873 --> 13:29.534
Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.903
-I love you, Costanza.
-Will you shut up?

13:32.077 --> 13:35.638
Now, George! Turn on the faucet.
George, turn on the faucet.

13:35.915 --> 13:42.514
Hoochie mama. Hoochie mama.
Hoochie mama.

13:43.856 --> 13:46.051
So, now, the other Lippman
kissed me.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.383
Oh, sure.
They're Jewish and you're a shiksa.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.586
-What?
-It means non-Jewish woman.

13:50.763 --> 13:54.358
I know what it means. But what does
being a shiksa have to do with it?

13:54.533 --> 13:55.591
You've got shiks-appeal.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.259
Jewish men love a woman
that's not like their mother.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.962
-Oh, that's insane.
-I'll tell you what's insane.

14:01.140 --> 14:04.041
The price that I could get you
on a new desktop computer.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.943
-I am not buying a computer from you.
-There's porn.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.509
Even so.

14:13.252 --> 14:16.050
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman.
I'm very flattered...

14:16.222 --> 14:20.556
...that you found me attractive enough
to lunge at me.

14:20.726 --> 14:23.627
But the only reason you like me
is because I'm a shiksa.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.026
That's simply not true.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.462
If you weren't Jewish,
you wouldn't be interested.

14:28.634 --> 14:31.467
-You are wrong. I'll prove it.
-Oh, no, don't.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.366
I renounce Judaism.

14:38.577 --> 14:39.737
What happened to you, pal?

14:39.912 --> 14:42.107
Joey Zanfino and some
of the neighborhood kids...

14:42.281 --> 14:45.375
...they ambushed me with a box
of Grade A's.

14:45.551 --> 14:49.214
-Are you all right?
-Oh, no, I'm fine. Fine. Serenity now.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.423
Serenity now. Serenity now.

14:53.592 --> 14:56.117
So you're using Frank's
relaxation method?

14:56.295 --> 15:00.425
Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off.
Serenity now.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.334
Serenity now.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.976
-Hey, what happened to you?
-Serenity.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.213
Well...

15:18.584 --> 15:21.610
...you are not gonna believe this.
Now Lippman has renounced.

15:21.787 --> 15:23.948
This shiksa thing
is totally out of control.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.990
What is with you people?

15:29.328 --> 15:32.627
-What are you looking at?
-Sit down, Elaine.

15:32.798 --> 15:35.961
Oh, no, Jerry, I can't take any more
gentle sobbing.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.660
I've been thinking about what it means
to be complete.

15:38.837 --> 15:39.826
Do you have an apple?

15:40.005 --> 15:42.599
Look at us, hurtling through space
on this big blue marble.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.766
Or a nectarine.
I would love a nectarine.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.139
Looking everywhere
for some kind of meaning.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.713
Why am I in such a fruit mood?
Banana.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.146
When all the while,
the real secret to happiness...

15:52.318 --> 15:54.309
...has been right here in front of us.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.056
-What?
-Elaine--

15:59.158 --> 16:01.683
Jerry, I found a way
to beat Lloyd Braun.

16:01.860 --> 16:04.556
I buy the computers myself,
I store them in your apartment.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.961
Then after I win the contest, I bring
them all back, I get my money back.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.828
It's brilliant.

16:10.102 --> 16:12.127
Wait, what's wrong with your leg?

16:13.839 --> 16:15.864
I'm asking Elaine to marry me.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.942
I'll store these over
at Kramer's apartment.

16:25.117 --> 16:26.607
It's all right.

16:28.287 --> 16:29.276
All fine.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.349
Elaine--

16:32.091 --> 16:36.585
Jerry, I've got a lot going on
with Lippman right now.

16:36.762 --> 16:40.163
-Lippman?
-Yeah, and him too.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.096
What?

16:42.267 --> 16:44.132
Oh, yeah.

16:44.803 --> 16:48.295
I think George is calling me,
so I'm gonna go and give him a hand.

16:48.474 --> 16:50.772
-Come on. Come on!
-Can I help you?

16:50.943 --> 16:53.935
Stay. Stay. Stay.

16:54.813 --> 16:57.873
Hey, Braun,
Costanza's kicking your butt.

16:58.050 --> 16:59.881
Watch how it's done.

17:03.489 --> 17:05.923
Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay.

17:07.259 --> 17:08.954
Would you like to buy a computer?

17:09.361 --> 17:11.625
Oh, really? Two dozen.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.188
Costanza, you're white hot.

17:14.566 --> 17:18.058
<i>If you'd like to make call,
please hang up and--</i>

17:20.105 --> 17:22.300
Hey, Braun,
I got good news and bad news.

17:22.473 --> 17:26.501
-They're both the same. You're fired.
-Costanza, you won the Waterpik.

17:26.678 --> 17:29.238
You're not gonna give away
that Waterpik.

17:29.415 --> 17:32.441
You wanna bet?
Serenity now. Serenity now.

17:33.252 --> 17:37.655
You know, you should tell your dad
that "serenity now" thing doesn't work.

17:37.823 --> 17:40.519
It just bottles up the anger
and then, eventually...

17:40.692 --> 17:42.091
-...you blow.
-What do you know?

17:42.261 --> 17:45.162
-You were in the nut house.
-What do you think put me there?

17:45.731 --> 17:48.666
I heard they found a family
in your freezer.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.802
Serenity now...

17:50.969 --> 17:52.561
...insanity later.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.632
What happened here, Kramer?

17:56.809 --> 17:59.141
-Serenity now. Serenity now.
-Kramer.

18:00.846 --> 18:03.246
Jerry. I didn't hear you come in.

18:03.916 --> 18:08.182
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the children,
they've done some redecorating.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.152
You don't look well.

18:12.458 --> 18:15.291
That's odd, because I feel perfectly
at peace with the world.

18:15.461 --> 18:17.258
Eggs, you.

18:19.398 --> 18:23.596
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me,
I stepped on your last rose.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.704
Jerry, come on.
Don't get so upset about it.

18:26.872 --> 18:29.739
There's always next spring.
Would you excuse me for a moment?

18:31.610 --> 18:32.872
Serenity now!

18:33.045 --> 18:36.310
Jerry, I did it. I beat Braun.

18:36.482 --> 18:37.506
Serenity now.

18:37.683 --> 18:39.947
Come on. Lend me a hand
with the computers?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.679
Serenity now!

18:42.855 --> 18:46.291
Why couldn't you squeeze one
of those stupid rubber balls...

18:46.458 --> 18:47.686
...to get your stress out?

18:47.860 --> 18:51.853
Why did you have to destroy
25 computers?

18:52.498 --> 18:55.160
George, you listen to me...

18:55.601 --> 18:57.330
...I owe you one.

18:58.537 --> 18:59.731
All right?

19:05.811 --> 19:07.972
He's incorrigible.

19:08.847 --> 19:11.042
-You wanna talk about it?
-Please don't tell me...

19:11.216 --> 19:13.514
...you love me again, Jerry.
I can't handle it.

19:13.685 --> 19:17.246
George, letting my emotions out
was the best thing I've ever done.

19:17.422 --> 19:20.050
Sure, I'm not funny anymore...

19:20.492 --> 19:25.520
...but there's more to life than making
shallow, fairly obvious observations.

19:26.765 --> 19:28.096
How about you?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.795
All right.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.664
Here it goes.

19:38.544 --> 19:42.412
Rabbi, is there anything I can do
to combat this shiks-appeal?

19:42.581 --> 19:46.312
Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth.
Like the yeti...

19:46.485 --> 19:50.854
...or his North American cousin,
the Sasquatch.

19:51.590 --> 19:53.114
Well, something's going on here...

19:53.292 --> 19:56.227
...because every able-bodied Israelite
in the county...

19:56.395 --> 19:58.386
...is driving pretty strong
to the hoop.

19:58.564 --> 20:02.159
Elaine, there's much you don't
understand about the Jewish religion.

20:02.334 --> 20:07.135
For example, did you know
that rabbis are allowed to date?

20:07.773 --> 20:09.297
Well, what does that have to do--?

20:09.474 --> 20:11.203
You know, a member
of my congregation...

20:11.376 --> 20:13.640
...has a time-share in Myrtle Beach.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.677
Perhaps if you're not too busy...

20:15.847 --> 20:18.748
...we could wing on down
after the High Holidays.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.413
Elaine?

20:22.054 --> 20:23.646
Lainey?

20:25.157 --> 20:26.988
So that's it.

20:27.159 --> 20:29.923
All of my darkest fears...

20:30.095 --> 20:32.290
...and everything I'm capable of.

20:32.464 --> 20:33.988
That's me.

20:40.105 --> 20:43.074
Well, good luck with all that.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.439
Where are you going?

20:45.611 --> 20:48.171
I thought I could count on you
for a little compassion.

20:48.347 --> 20:50.144
I think you scared me straight.

20:52.317 --> 20:55.445
-All right, Jerome, I'm in.
-What?

20:55.621 --> 20:57.282
Maybe we should get married.

20:57.456 --> 21:01.187
Maybe everything we need
is right here in front of us.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.487
Jer, let's do it.

21:04.229 --> 21:06.254
I tell you, I don't see it happening.

21:07.232 --> 21:09.029
What?
What happened to the new Jerry?

21:09.201 --> 21:10.828
He doesn't work here anymore.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.664
Oh, well, that's just great!

21:16.208 --> 21:18.870
-I love you, Jerry.
-Right back at you, slick.

21:24.349 --> 21:27.682
You know, all these years...

21:27.919 --> 21:30.945
...I've always wanted to see
the two of you get back together.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.183
Well, that's because you're an idiot.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

21:45.137 --> 21:46.604
You single-handedly...

21:46.772 --> 21:49.536
...brought Costanza and Son
to the brink of bankruptcy.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.573
Well, what about
all the Lloyd Braun sales?

21:51.743 --> 21:55.474
He was crazy.
His phone wasn't even hooked up.

21:57.382 --> 21:59.213
He just liked ringing that bell.

21:59.851 --> 22:03.378
I told you to clean up this garage.

22:03.555 --> 22:06.183
I have to put my car in.

22:06.525 --> 22:08.015
This is a place of business.

22:08.193 --> 22:11.822
I told you never to come in here.
Serenity now.

22:12.397 --> 22:14.331
All right.

22:17.202 --> 22:20.660
Dad, you really should lay off
the serenity-now stuff.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.397
So, what am I supposed to say?

22:23.342 --> 22:25.105
Hoochie mama.

22:27.612 --> 22:31.412
Move your crap, I'm coming in.

22:33.418 --> 22:35.579
No, you're not.

22:36.822 --> 22:39.620
Hoochie mama. Hoochie mama.
