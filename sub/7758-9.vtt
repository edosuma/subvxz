GOOD-BYE.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.474
[laughter and chatter]

01:42.503 --> 01:44.673
- SO YOU'VE BEEN WORKING OUT.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.605
- WOULD YOU JUST SHOOT?

01:46.640 --> 01:51.180
- POOL IS A GAME OF PRECISION
AND SCIENCE, MY FRIEND.

01:51.212 --> 01:54.152
IT INVOLVES INTRICATE
EYE-HAND COORDINATION,

01:54.182 --> 01:57.252
GEOMETRY,
SPECIFIC GRAVITY,

01:57.285 --> 02:00.915
MOLECULAR DENSITY--
- IT'S A FUCKING BALL AND STICK.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.794
- WILL YOU TAKE THE SHOT,
MIKEY?

02:02.823 --> 02:04.733
- I CAN'T, I GOT TO GO
MEET DAVID.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.528
- WHY DOESN'T HE EVER
MEET YOU HERE?

02:06.560 --> 02:09.759
- UM, BECAUSE
HE DOESN'T LIKE MY FRIENDS.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.227
- I DON'T LIKE
YOUR FRIENDS.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.636
- WHAT ABOUT HIS FRIENDS?
DOES HE HAVE ANY?

02:14.668 --> 02:17.438
- HEY, I SUNK ONE.
- YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE STRIPES.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.741
- YEAH,
SURE HE HAS FRIENDS.

02:18.772 --> 02:19.742
- HAVE YOU EVER
MET ANY?

02:19.773 --> 02:20.813
- UM, NO.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.581
- MAYBE HE DOESN'T
WANT YOU TO.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.780
- HEY, THERE.

02:24.812 --> 02:29.182
- WELL, AT LEAST HIS FRIENDS
ARE HIS OWN AGE.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.847
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:31.885 --> 02:33.785
- I THOUGHT
IT WAS A SCHOOL NIGHT.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.721
- YOU'RE HERE.
- I'M A GROWN UP.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.786
- BARELY.

02:37.825 --> 02:38.785
- GO HOME.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.726
- [whispering] NO.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.774
- SO WHAT IS THIS,
ADOPT-A-TRICK?

02:45.799 --> 02:48.339
FIRST, HE'S A ONE-NIGHT STAND,
NOW, HE'S MOVED IN.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.799
- IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.
- UH-HUH, UNTIL HE GROWS UP?

02:50.838 --> 02:53.738
- UNTIL I FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO WITH HIM.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.814
MIKEY.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.583
TELL THE DOC WE MISS HIM.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.581
- BYE. BYE.
- BYE.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.623
- SEE YA.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.818
- THAT COULD BE HIM.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.423
- WHO?
- USEMYHOLE27.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.286
- USEMYHOLE27?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

03:10.324 --> 03:12.734
LIKE, 26 OTHER GUYS
HAVE USED HIS HOLE BEFORE YOU?

03:12.760 --> 03:15.830
- NO.
HE'S MY CYBER-BOYFRIEND.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.833
SWIMMER'S BUILD,
LEO-LIKE SMILE.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.966
IT'S THE BEST IMAGINARY SEX
I EVER HAD,

03:22.002 --> 03:24.672
BUT NOW IT'S OVER.
- HOW COME?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.965
- BECAUSE HE WANTS TO MEET ME.
- SO?

03:27.007 --> 03:30.507
- SO I'M NOTHING LIKE
MY PROFILE, SO.

03:30.544 --> 03:35.354
BIG, SMOOTH, 6'2",
195 POUNDS, 4% BODY FAT...

03:35.383 --> 03:36.883
UNCUT.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.647
- JESUS.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.986
I THINK I DID IT WITH YOU
JUST LAST WEEK.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.491
- EW.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.993
HOW WAS I?

03:45.025 --> 03:47.395
- DID YOU EVER CONSIDER
JUST TELLING HIM THE TRUTH?

03:47.428 --> 03:49.628
- UH, WHAT? WHAT,
THAT I'M A BIG, NELLY BOTTOM

03:49.663 --> 03:52.573
WHO WISHES HE WERE
A BEEFY, BRUTAL TOP,

03:52.600 --> 03:55.540
AND NEVER WILL BE?

03:57.838 --> 04:01.478
[baby crying]

04:01.509 --> 04:03.539
- YES, HELLO.
THIS IS LINDSAY PETERSEN.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.607
I NEED TO TALK
TO DR. PERSAUD.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.305
IT'S ABOUT GUS.
- OH, GOD.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.477
HE'S THROWING UP
AGAIN.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.915
SHH, SHH, SHH.
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

04:08.949 --> 04:09.949
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.053
HE'S BURNING UP,
HONEY.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.394
- OUR BABY'S SICK
AND I HAVE TO T--

04:12.420 --> 04:13.190
[baby cries]
[chuckles]

04:13.220 --> 04:14.320
THEY WANT US
TO LEAVE OUR NUMBER

04:14.355 --> 04:15.715
AND WHEN SHE CALLS IN,
THEY'LL GIVE HER THE MESSAGE.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.986
- GIVE IT TO ME.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.394
HELLO, UH,
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

04:18.426 --> 04:21.396
HI, CAROL.
THIS IS MELANIE MARCUS.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.929
LISTEN, WE NEED
TO REACH DR. PERSAUD.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.733
DOESN'T SHE USUALLY
LEAVE HER PAGER ON?

04:24.765 --> 04:26.895
OKAY, GREAT.
THEN I'D APPRECIATE IT

04:26.934 --> 04:29.004
IF YOU'D PLEASE CONTACT HER
WHILE I WAIT ON THE LINE.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.566
THANK YOU.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.535

04:34.808 --> 04:39.078
[baby crying]

04:39.112 --> 04:40.452
- HELLO, DR. PERSAUD?

04:40.481 --> 04:41.751
HI,

04:41.782 --> 04:43.722
YEAH, IT'S GUS.
HE HAS A FEVER, 102,

04:43.751 --> 04:45.651
AND HE'S BEEN
THROWING UP--

04:45.686 --> 04:48.386
YES, ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.792
SHE SAID WE HAVE TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT AWAY.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.763
- OKAY, OKAY. LISTEN,
IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

04:51.792 --> 04:52.792
I'LL GET THE KEYS,
YOU GET HIS BLANKY.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.056
- OKAY.

04:54.094 --> 04:58.574
- BRIAN'S HOME.
YOU MEAN IT?

04:58.599 --> 05:01.369
MY MOM SAYS "HI."

05:04.972 --> 05:07.412
BRIAN SAYS "HI" TOO.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.841
YEAH.

05:09.877 --> 05:13.977
SO DOES DAD
ASK ABOUT ME?

05:14.014 --> 05:16.984
OH, IS HE STILL MAD?

05:18.586 --> 05:21.556
CAN YOU TALK TO HIM?
MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND?

05:24.858 --> 05:27.698
NO, NO, I CAN'T.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.098
I CAN'T COME HOME.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.669
NOT IF HE STILL
FEELS THAT WAY. [scoffs]

05:31.699 --> 05:34.699
MOM? MOM.

05:34.735 --> 05:37.035
I'M GOING TO GO.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.840
GIVE MOLLY
A KISS FOR ME.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.814
YEAH, YOU TOO.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.576
[sighs, clears throat]

05:48.616 --> 05:49.576
[sniffs]

05:49.617 --> 05:52.787
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY
NOT WORTH CRYING ABOUT.

05:56.757 --> 06:01.497
- I WASN'T CRYING.
JUST MY ALLERGIES.

06:01.529 --> 06:05.469
- YOUR FATHER'S AN ASSHOLE
WHO TREATS YOU LIKE SHIT.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.569
HE PRACTICALLY
KILLED ME.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.101
I SAY
FORGET ABOUT HIM.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.796
- YEAH,
BUT HE'S MY DAD.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.468
I MEAN, COULD YOU
FORGET ABOUT YOUR FATHER?

06:12.506 --> 06:14.436
- I ALREADY DID,
A LONG TIME AGO.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.075
- YOU MEAN YOU NEVER SEE HIM
OR TALK TO HIM?

06:16.109 --> 06:17.579
- WHAT FOR?

06:17.611 --> 06:19.611
- JUST TO HANG OUT,
BE TOGETHER.

06:19.647 --> 06:22.517
- [chuckles] YEAH, JUST BECAUSE
HE GOT MY MOTHER PREGNANT

06:22.550 --> 06:26.020
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE'S
SOME SPECIAL BOND BETWEEN US.

06:26.053 --> 06:29.623
HE SERVED HIS PURPOSE.
THAT'S ALL HE WAS GOOD FOR.

06:29.657 --> 06:33.527
- I COULD NEVER FEEL THAT WAY
ABOUT MY DAD.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.831
- WELL, THEN YOU'LL ALWAYS
BE HURT.

06:35.863 --> 06:41.973
[phone ringing]

06:42.002 --> 06:43.672
- HELLO?

06:43.704 --> 06:46.174
OH, HI.

06:46.206 --> 06:49.776
YEAH, HOLD ON,
HE'S RIGHT HERE.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.850
IT'S LINDSAY.
SHE SOUNDS UPSET.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.084
- AH!
both: [laugh]

06:56.116 --> 06:57.986
- QUIT IT.
- I CAN'T HELP IT.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.048
I SEE YOU, I JUST
WANT TO TAKE A BITE.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.087
- WHO CALLED?

07:02.122 --> 07:03.992
- OH, MY EX.

07:04.024 --> 07:04.794
- LORI?

07:04.825 --> 07:06.925
- YEAH,
I TOLD HER ALL ABOUT YOU.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.800
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?
- I SAID YOU WERE SMART,

07:08.829 --> 07:10.459
YOU WERE FUNNY,
AND YOU WERE SEXY.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.098
- I THOUGHT YOU STOPPED
LYING TO YOUR WIFE.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.132
- COME ON,
LET'S GO TO BED.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.637
- WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

07:15.669 --> 07:17.609
- WHICH--
LET ME SEE.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.008
- PEOPLE IN THE PICTURE.
THEY LOOK NICE.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.069
THEY LOOK STRAIGHT.
- [laughs]

07:21.108 --> 07:23.678
THAT'S LAURA AND STEVE.
THIS IS ON NEW YEAR'S EVE.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.211
STEVE'S A UROLOGIST,
LAURA WORKS AT PITT.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.745
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS
OF MIND.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.120
- SO HOW COME
I'VE NEVER MET THEM?

07:28.148 --> 07:30.618
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.
YOU WANT TO MEET THEM?

07:30.651 --> 07:33.951
- I DON'T KNOW.
YOU WANT ME TO MEET THEM?

07:33.987 --> 07:38.727
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?
- NOTHING. I WAS JUST--

07:38.759 --> 07:40.089
I WAS DRIVING OVER HERE
TONIGHT

07:40.127 --> 07:41.287
WITH MY BAG OF STUFF
FOR TOMORROW,

07:41.328 --> 07:43.558
AND I JUST STARTED TO FEEL
LIKE SOMEBODY'S LITTLE SECRET.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.967
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS
JUST THE TWO OF US.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.099
- WELL, I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I KIND OF ENJOY IT THAT WAY,

07:48.135 --> 07:49.935
JUST HAVING YOU
ALL TO MYSELF,

07:49.970 --> 07:52.710
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO BE WITH OTHER PEOPLE--

07:52.740 --> 07:55.240
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
I'M SOR--

07:55.275 --> 07:56.705
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
BROUGHT IT UP.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.014
- NO, I'M GLAD YOU DID.

07:58.045 --> 08:02.045
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SATURDAY NIGHT?

08:02.082 --> 08:03.282
- SATURDAY NIGHT?

08:03.316 --> 08:04.516
- YEAH, WE'LL HAVE
A DINNER PARTY.

08:04.552 --> 08:05.852
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU
TO THE GANG.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.956
- THE GANG?
NO, THAT'S OKAY.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.858
- NO, IT'S A GREAT IDEA,
YOU KNOW?

08:09.890 --> 08:13.830
I WANT THEM TO KNOW YOU,
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THEM.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.996
AH!
[both laugh]

08:19.032 --> 08:22.742
[police siren
wailing in the distance]

08:22.770 --> 08:24.540
[beeping]

08:24.572 --> 08:27.582
[magical buzzing]
- HEY.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.608
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?
- [gasps]

08:29.643 --> 08:31.883
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
HOW--HOW'D YOU GET IN HERE?

08:31.912 --> 08:33.011
HEY, I ASKED
A QUESTION FIRST.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.876
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING DELETING ME?

08:34.914 --> 08:37.075
DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?

08:37.116 --> 08:40.687
I'M "PITTS9X6."

08:40.721 --> 08:42.691
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
MY SECRET SCREEN NAME?

08:42.722 --> 08:44.793
- WELL, DUDE,
I AM YOUR SCREEN NAME.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.625
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
DID--DID TED PUT YOU UP TO THIS?

08:47.661 --> 08:53.231
- PROFILE: BIG, SMOOTH,
6'2", 195 POUNDS,

08:53.266 --> 08:57.066
4% BODY FAT, UNCUT.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.241
- OKAY.
OKAY, I GET IT.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.014
MICHAEL AND TED
READ MY PROFILE,

09:03.043 --> 09:05.783
AND THEY PAID YOU TO COME HERE
AND MESS WITH MY HEAD.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.653
WELL,
MY GRIP ON REALITY

09:07.681 --> 09:10.151
IS A LITTLE TIGHTER
THAN EVERYONE SEEMS TO THINK.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.623
OKAY?
PITTS DOESN'T EXIST.

09:12.653 --> 09:16.063
HE'S A FANTASY, A FIGMENT
OF MY OVERACTIVE IMAGINAT--

09:18.225 --> 09:20.825
OH. OH, MY GOD.
[chuckles]

09:20.861 --> 09:23.731
IT'S TRUE.
YOU REALLY ARE--

09:23.764 --> 09:27.074
- 9X6,
THANKS TO YOU.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.340
- YEAH.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.899
OKAY,
I-I MUST BE DREAMING.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.808
I DON'T--
- THESE ARE SOME HOT TAPES.

09:33.841 --> 09:37.081
DAWSON'S CRACK.
MIND IF I POP IT IN?

09:37.110 --> 09:40.210
- OH, MY GOD,
I'VE COMPLETELY CRACKED.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.817
I'M TALKING
TO MY SCREEN NAME.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.119
OKAY, W-WHAT IS GOING ON?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:44.151 --> 09:45.951
- WELL, I ALMOST WASN'T.
YOU WERE ABOUT TO DELETE ME.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.086
- OH. WELL,
I'M VERY SORRY,

09:48.121 --> 09:51.091
BUT I'M--
I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.834
- BUT I'M A HOTTIE.
EVERYBODY ONLINE WANTS ME.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.230
- EXACTLY. THEY WANT YOU,
THE FANTASY.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.332
NOT ME, THE REAL PERSON.
IT'S PATHETIC,

09:57.364 --> 09:59.334
MY SCREEN NAME HAS MORE FUN
THAT I DO.

09:59.366 --> 10:04.296
- HEY, YOU SAID YOU WISH
YOU COULD BE A BEEFY, BRUTAL TOP

10:04.337 --> 10:07.037
INSTEAD OF A BIG,
NELLY BOTTOM.

10:07.074 --> 10:11.214
WELL, IF I COULD TEACH YOU
HOW TO BE LIKE ME,

10:11.244 --> 10:14.754
WILL YOU LET ME LIVE?

10:14.782 --> 10:16.282
- BUT I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.386
- WELL...

10:18.418 --> 10:20.218
I CAME FROM SOMEWHERE,
DIDN'T I?

10:20.253 --> 10:23.223
[techno music]

10:23.256 --> 10:26.356
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.

10:26.393 --> 10:29.863
COMING THROUGH.
LOOK OUT, PLEASE.

10:29.897 --> 10:30.857
- WHAT ARE HIS SYMPTOMS?

10:30.898 --> 10:33.168
- UH, DIARRHEA,
VOMITING, FEVER.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.140
- DO YOU KNOW HOW HIGH?
- JUST UNDER 102

10:35.168 --> 10:36.198
THE LAST TIME WE CHECKED.
- YEAH, WE'RE--

10:36.236 --> 10:37.706
WE'RE WORRIED
ABOUT DEHYDRATION.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.238
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET HIM CHECKED OUT.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.383
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS THE MOTHER?

10:42.409 --> 10:44.239
- WELL--
- WELL, I'M THE BIRTH MOTHER.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.877
- WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK
WITH HIM THEN?

10:45.913 --> 10:47.153
AND YOU CAN WAIT HERE.
- ACTUALLY,

10:47.180 --> 10:49.320
WE'RE RAISING HIM TOGETHER.
WE'RE A COUPLE.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.449
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,
DO YOU HAVE ADOPTION PAPERS?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.285
- ADOPTION?
- HE MEANS FOR ME.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.421
NO, NOT YET.
WE PLAN TO FILE FOR--

10:55.455 --> 10:57.015
- I'M SORRY,
BUT WE CAN ONLY ALLOW

10:57.057 --> 10:58.927
THE CHILD'S LEGAL GUARDIANS
TO GO WITH HIM.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.829
- FINE. STOP TALKING.
JUST TAKE HIM, NOW, OKAY?

11:01.862 --> 11:03.432
- I'LL RUN BACK OUT
THE MINUTE I KNOW ANYTHING.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.403
- OKAY.
- I LOVE YOU.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.888
EXCUSE ME,
I NEED TO GO BACK THERE.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.860
YOU SEE, MY PARTNER
FORGOT OUR BABY'S BLANKET

11:28.889 --> 11:30.319
AND I DON'T WANT HIM TO BE
ANY MORE UPSET--

11:30.357 --> 11:33.927
- LOOK, MISS--
OR WHATEVER YOU ARE--

11:33.961 --> 11:36.161
I BELIEVE IT WAS ALREADY
EXPLAINED TO YOU

11:36.196 --> 11:38.796
THAT ONLY THE CHILD'S PARENTS
OR LEGAL GUARDIANS

11:38.832 --> 11:41.472
ARE PERMITTED
TO BE WITH HIM.

11:41.501 --> 11:45.441
- AND I BELIEVE IT NEEDS
TO BE EXPLAINED TO YOU

11:45.472 --> 11:47.472
THAT I'M THE ONE WHO LOVES HIM,
AND FEEDS HIM,

11:47.507 --> 11:48.337
AND WALKS HIM,
AND PLAYS WITH HIM,

11:48.375 --> 11:49.305
AND CHANGES HIM,
AND CLEANS UP HIS SHIT,

11:49.342 --> 11:51.882
AND WIPES UP HIS VOMIT,
AND PAYS THE BILLS,

11:51.912 --> 11:54.152
AND--
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.221
I STAY UP HALF THE NIGHT
WORRYING

11:56.249 --> 11:58.949
THAT HE WILL GROW UP
TO BE HAPPY AND HEALTHY

11:58.986 --> 12:01.886
AND LOVED,
SO DON'T YOU DARE TELL ME

12:01.922 --> 12:03.262
I HAVE NO RIGHT
TO BE WITH HIM,

12:03.290 --> 12:07.030
YOU OFFICIOUS,
HOMOPHOBIC CUNT.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.460
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
HOW IS HE?

12:08.495 --> 12:11.195
- I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.
THEY WON'T LET ME BACK THERE.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.401
- WHY?
- I'M--I'M NOT LEGAL,

12:13.433 --> 12:16.073
I'M NOT ANYTHING, APPARENTLY,
EXCEPT GOING CRAZY.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.343
- WHAT IS THAT,
YOUR FUCKING BUREAUCRACY?

12:18.371 --> 12:22.111
- EXCUSE ME,
THIS IS THE FATHER.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.112
- I'LL TAKE YOU BACK.
- WELL, SHE'S GOING TOO.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.114
- NO, DON'T WORRY,
JUST GO, AND--

12:26.146 --> 12:29.116
UH, GIVE THIS TO HIM.

12:50.470 --> 12:54.440

12:54.474 --> 12:56.914
[exhaling]
NOT EVEN SIX MONTHS OLD

12:56.944 --> 12:59.554
AND ALREADY MY KID'S
A DRAMA QUEEN.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.019
- WELL, AT LEAST
YOU KNOW HE'S YOURS.

13:02.049 --> 13:04.319
- THE GOOD NEWS IS
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.151
- YEAH, ONLY I HAD TO
GO TO THE HOSPITAL MYSELF

13:06.186 --> 13:08.456
BECAUSE SOMEONE
LEFT THEIR CELL PHONE OFF.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.088
- I HAD TO DEAL
WITH MY OWN CRISIS.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.164
DAVID'S THROWING
A DINNER PARTY,

13:12.192 --> 13:14.832
US AND TWO OTHER COUPLES.
ONE OF THEM'S STRAIGHT.

13:14.862 --> 13:15.932
- HE EATS
WITH STRAIGHT PEOPLE?

13:15.963 --> 13:19.303
- ICK. YOU NEVER KNOW
WHERE THEIR HANDS HAVE BEEN.

13:19.332 --> 13:22.372
- SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

13:22.402 --> 13:24.542
- THE PROBLEM IS,
WHAT'LL I TALK ABOUT?

13:24.571 --> 13:26.341
- WHAT DO WE TALK ABOUT?
- WHAT WE'VE DONE,

13:26.373 --> 13:29.313
WHO WE'VE DONE,
WHO WE WANT TO DO. [laughs]

13:29.342 --> 13:31.182
- THESE PEOPLE
AREN'T LIKE US.

13:31.211 --> 13:34.051
THEY'RE PROFESSORS
AND DOCTORS AND THINGS.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.051
- WE'RE THINGS.

13:36.083 --> 13:40.023
AD EXECS, ACCOUNTANTS.

13:40.053 --> 13:43.063
- COUTURIERS
TO DISCO TRASH.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.060
- THE THING IS,
AFTER TWO MINUTES

13:45.092 --> 13:47.092
IT'LL BE PAINFULLY OBVIOUS
THAT I DON'T FIT IN,

13:47.127 --> 13:48.997
AND DAVID'LL DUMP ME
ON THE SPOT.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.929
- THEN WE BETTER
GET BUSY.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.074
RIGHT, PROFESSOR HIGGINS?

13:52.099 --> 13:53.929
- RIGHT, PICKERING.
[chuckles]

13:53.967 --> 13:56.037
WE'LL TURN YOU
FROM A SIMPLE FLOWER GIRL

13:56.069 --> 13:57.469
INTO A LADY.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.614
- SPEAKING OF LADIES,
GET TO WORK.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.179
- WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:05.212 --> 14:07.952
- TURNING YOU FROM A CANDY-ASS
INTO A STUD.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.351
NOW, LET'S SEE YOU
SPREAD 'EM.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.352
NOW!
- ALL RIGHT.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.317
[growls]

14:15.355 --> 14:19.225
[grunting]

14:19.259 --> 14:21.289
- WHAT'S WITH G.I. JANE?

14:21.328 --> 14:22.358
- [grunts]
- IF HE'S NOT CAREFUL,

14:22.395 --> 14:23.955
HE MIGHT ACTUALLY
BREAK A SWEAT.

14:23.997 --> 14:27.097
OR A NAIL.
- [chuckling]

14:27.134 --> 14:29.404
- [grunting]

14:31.604 --> 14:33.674
- HE'S DOWN,
FOR A WHILE, ANYWAY.

14:33.706 --> 14:39.506
- THAT'S GOOD. MM.

14:39.546 --> 14:43.616
- HON, WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT? [sighs]

14:43.650 --> 14:46.290
- HEBREW SCHOOL.
- [chuckles]

14:46.319 --> 14:50.389
HE'S STILL A LITTLE YOUNG,
DON'T YOU THINK? [laughs]

14:53.560 --> 14:56.500
- NO, WHEN I WAS A KID
IN HEBREW SCHOOL,

14:56.529 --> 15:00.129
RABBI PROTESH
USED TO SAY TO US,

15:00.167 --> 15:02.437
"IF YOU EVER FORGET
YOU'RE A JEW,

15:02.469 --> 15:05.109
A NON-JEW WILL
REMIND YOU."

15:05.138 --> 15:08.408
I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHAT HE MEANT,

15:08.441 --> 15:12.111
UNTIL EMILY MEREDITH CALLED ME
A "JAP" ON THE PLAYGROUND.

15:12.145 --> 15:15.215
- OH, THAT LITTLE BITCH.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.188
- WELL, THEN I KNEW
WHAT HE MEANT.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.388
I HAD FORGOTTEN
I WAS DIFFERENT,

15:20.420 --> 15:24.620
UNTIL I WAS
SO THOUGHTFULLY REMINDED.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.027
SAME THING HAPPENED
AT THE HOSPITAL LAST NIGHT.

15:27.060 --> 15:30.100
- WELL, THEY HAD NO RIGHT.
- YEAH, THEY DID.

15:30.130 --> 15:33.700
THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT,
BUT WE HAVE A RIGHT TOO,

15:33.733 --> 15:35.503
TO PROTECT OURSELVES.

15:35.535 --> 15:36.495
- HOW?

15:36.536 --> 15:40.266
- WE NEED TO TALK
TO BRIAN.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.105
- MISS MANNERS SAYS,

15:47.147 --> 15:49.717
"ALWAYS BE SURE
TO COMPLIMENT THE HOSTESS."

15:49.749 --> 15:51.349
- I AM THE HOSTESS.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.054
- AND YOU LOOK LOVELY.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.417
- [chuckles]

15:55.455 --> 15:57.155
[sighs] OKAY.

15:57.190 --> 16:00.190
- ALL RIGHT, NOW.
UH, WHICH FORK'S FOR SALAD?

16:00.227 --> 16:02.027
- GO FROM THE OUTSIDE IN.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.332
- HEY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
STUDYING FOR YOUR CALCULUS EXAM.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.774
- I'M TAKING A BREAK.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.498
- WELL,
GET BACK TO WORK.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.474
- NOW, WHERE'S
THE BREAD PLATE?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.472
- ON YOUR LEFT.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.474
- WATER GLASS?
- ON YOUR RIGHT.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.709
- WELL, AS LONG AS I ONLY HAVE
SALAD, BREAD, AND WATER,

16:19.746 --> 16:21.676
I'M ALL SET.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.624
- ALL RIGHT, NOW,
TOPICS OF CONVERSATION.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.021
UH, STAY CLEAR OF RELIGION
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW

16:27.054 --> 16:28.094
WHERE ANYBODY STANDS.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.321
AVOID POLITICS
LIKE THE PLAGUE,

16:30.357 --> 16:33.127
AND, UH, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY

16:33.160 --> 16:35.230
STEER CLEAR
OF THE ECONOMY AS WELL.

16:35.262 --> 16:37.232
- WELL, SO FAR
HE SHOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.204
MIKEY'S NEVER TALKED
ABOUT RELIGION, POLITICS,

16:39.232 --> 16:40.502
OR THE MARKET
IN HIS LIFE.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.143
WELL, WHAT DO I
TALK ABOUT?

16:42.169 --> 16:43.399
- MOVIES ARE ALWAYS
A SAFE BET

16:43.436 --> 16:46.536
IF YOU WANT TO APPEAR CURRENT
WITHOUT SOUNDING CONTROVERSIAL.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.606
- I SAW X-MEN SIX TIMES.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.083
- [laughs]
- YEAH, UH,

16:53.113 --> 16:55.653
SOMEHOW I SUSPECT THAT WON'T
"WOW" THE ART HOUSE CROWD.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.122
- LOOK, YOU'RE MAKING
TOO BIG A DEAL OUT OF THIS.

16:58.151 --> 17:01.251
YOU SHOW UP,
YOU TALK, YOU EAT.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.425
- BUT THESE ARE DAVID'S
BEST FRIENDS.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.828
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO MAKE
A GOOD IMPRESSION.

17:06.858 --> 17:07.858
- AND YOU WILL,

17:07.894 --> 17:09.503
YOU JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER
A FEW SIMPLE RULES.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.358
UTENSILS, OUTSIDE IN.
- DON'T TALK ABOUT

17:11.397 --> 17:12.728
ANYTHING THAT MATTERS.
- MATTERS.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.565
- DON'T TALK
WITH YOUR MOUTH FULL.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.502
- OH, WHAT IF I BURP?

17:17.537 --> 17:18.707
- JUST COVER YOUR MOUTH
WITH YOUR NAPKIN

17:18.738 --> 17:20.667
AND SAY "EXCUSE ME"
TO NO ONE IN PARTICULAR.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.707
JUST BE YOURSELF, YOU WON'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.682
- [sighs]

17:24.711 --> 17:26.651
I JUST KNOW SOMEHOW,
SOME WAY,

17:26.679 --> 17:28.819
I AM GOING TO FUCK UP.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.148
- WELL SEE,
THAT'S WHAT HE MEANS.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.854
BE YOURSELF.

17:32.885 --> 17:33.845
- [whispering]
OH, THAT LOOKS GOOD.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.286
- [whispering] THAT LOOKS GOOD.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.162
- PUT THAT RIGHT THERE.
- LET ME TALK TO HIM.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.760
YOU KNOW HOW YOU SET HIM OFF.
- OH, I PROMISE,

17:38.791 --> 17:42.061
I WON'T SAY A WORD.
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING.

17:44.864 --> 17:47.204
- HE SEEMS FINE TO ME.

17:47.234 --> 17:50.174
AREN'T YOU, SONNY BOY?
- THANK GOD, AFTER LAST NIGHT.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.443
- YESTERDAY, LIFE AND DEATH,
TODAY, TEA AND COOKIES.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.172
[chuckles]
- THEY'RE GOOD.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.237
- IT'S A MIX.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.546
[sighs]
- [clears throat]

17:59.579 --> 18:01.649
- BUT IT MAKES YOU REALIZE
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

18:01.681 --> 18:04.621
TO BE PREPARED.
- [chuckles]

18:04.651 --> 18:06.191
- FOR WHAT?

18:06.219 --> 18:08.719
- FOR LIKE WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THAT NURSE.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.215
- GOD, SHE WAS
A REAL BITCH.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.688
- [chuckles] THANK YOU.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.456
- JUSTIN, WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME ICE CREAM?

18:15.495 --> 18:18.465
- NO, I'M OKAY.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.433
- WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING AT?

18:21.468 --> 18:23.638
- WELL, IT'S SOMETHING
WE TALKED ABOUT

18:23.670 --> 18:27.770
BEFORE GUS WAS BORN, ONLY
WE NEVER GOT AROUND TO DOING IT.

18:27.807 --> 18:32.177
MELANIE WOULD LIKE TO PETITION
FOR SECOND-PARENT ADOPTION.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.312
- WHAT'S THAT?

18:33.346 --> 18:35.716
- WELL, I'M NOT
GUS' BIOLOGICAL PARENT,

18:35.748 --> 18:38.488
LIKE LINDSAY OR BRIAN,

18:38.518 --> 18:41.548
SO I NEED TO FILE PAPERS
TO MAKE ME HIS LEGAL GUARDIAN.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.818
- ONLY MELANIE CAN'T
GET THE PROCESS GOING

18:42.855 --> 18:48.755
UNTIL YOU SIGN PAPERS AGREEING
TO GIVE UP YOUR PARENTAL RIGHTS.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.425
- NO WAY.
HE'S GUS'S DAD.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.604
- NO ONE'S DENYING THAT.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.643
YOU KNOW YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
PART OF HIS LIFE,

18:56.669 --> 18:59.609
IN THE SAME WAY WE'LL ALWAYS BE
A PART OF EACH OTHER'S.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.645
- YOU DON'T
HAVE TO CONVINCE ME.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.279
JUST TELL ME
WHERE TO SIGN.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.575
- WHAT?

19:09.616 --> 19:10.916
- [sighs] OH.
- YOU MEAN YOU'RE ACTUALLY

19:10.950 --> 19:12.490
GONNA DO IT?
- JUSTIN.

19:12.519 --> 19:15.259
- HE'LL BE BETTER OFF.
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

19:15.288 --> 19:17.658
- SIGN SOME PAPERS.
I'LL HAVE THEM DRAWN UP.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.690
- YOU CAN'T.
- WOULD YOU STAY OUT OF THIS?

19:19.726 --> 19:21.556
- YOU'RE HIS FATHER.

19:21.594 --> 19:25.204
- AND I'M TEACHING HIM
A LESSON:

19:25.232 --> 19:30.342
DON'T COUNT
ON YOUR OLD MAN.

19:37.577 --> 19:40.547
[techno music]

19:40.580 --> 19:48.520
*

19:57.764 --> 20:00.234
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH YOUR ARM?

20:00.267 --> 20:01.827
- I CALL IT
THE "PRAISE JESUS."

20:01.868 --> 20:04.698
- LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE HAILING A CAB.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.437
- I CALL IT THE WORST DANCING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.614
- WHO ASKED YOU?

20:08.641 --> 20:11.781
- DON'T GET SORE.
I'M JUST KIDDING.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.481
- SEE ANYONE HOT?

20:13.513 --> 20:16.283
- I HAVEN'T SEEN SO MANY DOGS
SINCE 101 DALMATIANS.

20:16.316 --> 20:19.616
- HEY, WHAT ABOUT THAT GUY
OVER THERE?

20:19.652 --> 20:22.662
- I'D LIKE
TO HOUSEBREAK HIM.

20:22.689 --> 20:23.989

HE'S ALL RIGHT.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.663
- YEAH, TRANSLATION:
WE DON'T HAVE THE GUTS

20:25.692 --> 20:26.632
TO GO AFTER HIM.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.259
- SPEAK FOR YOURSELF,
LOSER.

20:36.303 --> 20:38.773
WELL, GO FOR IT.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.335

SPILL MY BEER.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.013
- SORRY.
- TELL HIM YOU'LL LICK IT

20:42.041 --> 20:43.681
OFF HIS CHEST.
- WHAT?

20:43.710 --> 20:44.910
- I SAID
YOU SPILLED MY BEER, MAN.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.554
- SAY IT.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.609

20:47.647 --> 20:49.047
I'D RATHER

20:54.321 --> 20:56.761
ASK HIM TO GO HOME. HEY, DUDE.
- HEY, DUDE--

20:56.789 --> 20:58.729
I NEVER SAY "DUDE."
- I CAN TELL YOU WANT IT BAD.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.688
- I-I-I CAN TELL
YOU WANT IT BAD.

21:00.727 --> 21:01.957
- WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GET
OUT OF HERE AND DO THE NASTY?

21:01.994 --> 21:04.304
- WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GET OUT OF HERE AND--

21:04.331 --> 21:05.901
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M--
HE'S MAKING ME DO THIS. [laughs]

21:05.932 --> 21:08.902
- FUCKING WEIRDO.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.544
- WELL, THAT WAS THE MOST
STUNNING DISPLAY OF INEPTITUDE

21:13.573 --> 21:15.343
I'VE EVER WITNESSED.

21:15.375 --> 21:18.405

YOU'RE FASHIONABLE.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.666
I'M LAURA. LISTEN,
I'VE KNOWN DAVID FOREVER.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.042
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HIM--

21:47.940 --> 21:49.440

WHEN HE CALLS ME THAT.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.506

- IN ECONOMICS.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.684
- [laughs] HEY, YOU.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.483

21:59.852 --> 22:00.992
YOU SEE?
SHE THINKS YOU'RE ADORABLE.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.620
- [sighs]

22:02.655 --> 22:04.015
I'M NERVOUS AS HELL.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.826

GOING TO LOVE YOU.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.558
- WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK THAT?

22:07.594 --> 22:09.804
- BECAUSE I DO.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.868
GO, GO, GO, GO.

22:21.774 --> 22:24.144
- "INSOUCIANT."

22:24.176 --> 22:27.546
- UNCONCERNED,
NONCHALANT.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.150
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.
[grunts]

22:30.182 --> 22:32.492
INSOUCIANT.

22:35.922 --> 22:36.722
- "SYCOPHANT."

22:36.756 --> 22:39.426
- UNCARING.

22:39.459 --> 22:41.759
- THAT'S WRONG,
IT MEANS ASS-KISSER.

22:41.794 --> 22:44.734
- IT DOESN'T SAY
"ASS-KISSER."

22:44.764 --> 22:48.104
- "ONE WHO SEEKS FAVOR
BY FLATTERY."

22:48.134 --> 22:50.144
ASS-KISSER.

22:50.169 --> 22:52.469
- WHO CARES
WHAT IT SAYS?

22:52.505 --> 22:54.605
HOW CAN YOU GIVE AWAY GUS?

22:54.641 --> 22:56.611
HE'LL THINK
YOU DIDN'T WANT HIM.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.013
- HE'LL BE RIGHT.

22:58.044 --> 23:02.454
- [scoffs]
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.822
I WAS THERE
THE NIGHT GUS WAS BORN.

23:04.851 --> 23:05.691
I SAW YOU
GIVE HIM A KISS--

23:05.718 --> 23:07.888
- NOT EVERYONE'S CUT OUT
TO BE A FATHER.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.460
- WELL, THEN, WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA TELL HIM,

23:09.489 --> 23:11.089
SOMEDAY WHEN HE'S OLD ENOUGH,
WHY YOU DIDN'T WANT HIM?

23:11.123 --> 23:13.033
- I'LL TELL HIM
THE TRUTH.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.559
THESE TWO DYKES I KNEW
WANTED A KID REALLY BAD,

23:15.595 --> 23:17.625
SO I JERKED OFF
INTO A CUP.

23:17.664 --> 23:20.034
- THAT'S NOT
ALL THERE IS TO IT.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.026
A BOY NEEDS A FATHER.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.568
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.
- YEAH, WELL,

23:23.603 --> 23:27.713
YOU HAVEN'T HAD A FATHER
FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS.

23:27.740 --> 23:32.750
- EVEN IF HE GETS ANGRY,
EVEN IF HE ISN'T ALWAYS THERE,

23:32.779 --> 23:35.619
IT'S BETTER THAN
NOT HAVING ONE AT ALL.

23:35.648 --> 23:38.648
- YEAH,
DON'T BE SO SURE.

23:38.685 --> 23:41.745
- YOUR FATHER
MUST HAVE LOVED YOU.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.618
HE PROBABLY JUST--
HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SHOW IT.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.786
- [laughs] YEAH, HE KNEW
HOW TO SHOW IT ALL RIGHT,

23:46.826 --> 23:51.026
ESPECIALLY
AFTER HE'D HAD A FEW.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.533
- AT LEAST
HE DIDN'T GIVE YOU AWAY.

23:53.566 --> 23:57.536
"GARRULOUS."
- LOQUACIOUS, CHATTY.

23:59.572 --> 24:02.172
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- OUT.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.778
- I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GOING TO HELP ME.

24:03.810 --> 24:06.750
- IF YOU WANT HELP,
CALL YOUR FATHER.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.490
- WHEW!
WHEN DAVID MAKES A MEAL,

24:13.520 --> 24:16.690
YOU DON'T EAT FOR A WEEK.
- BEFORE OR AFTER.

24:16.723 --> 24:17.493
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD COOK.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.994
- MM, YOU DO HAVE
A LOT TO LEARN.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.226
- GIVE HIM TIME,
AND HE'LL DISCOVER

24:21.260 --> 24:22.630
ALL MY LITTLE SECRETS.

24:22.662 --> 24:23.762
- LIKE UNDERWEAR.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.156
- LIKE--
[laughter]

24:25.197 --> 24:26.727
- YOU HAVE
AN UNDERWEAR FETISH?

24:26.766 --> 24:27.966
- ON OUR LAST TRIP
TOGETHER,

24:28.000 --> 24:31.800
HE BROUGHT AN ENTIRE SUITCASE
OF JOCKEY SHORTS AND SOCKS.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.138
- DID YOU ALL
GO SOMEWHERE TOGETHER?

24:33.172 --> 24:35.042
- MM, TUSCANY,
LAST FALL.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.884
- WE RENTED A HOUSE--
- IT WAS FABULOUS.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.680
- AND THE FOOD!
- OH, SHE'S STILL

24:39.712 --> 24:40.812
TALKING ABOUT THE FOOD.
- [groans]

24:40.847 --> 24:42.977
- TRY GETTING SIX POUNDS
OF PROSCIUTTO THROUGH CUSTOMS.

24:43.015 --> 24:46.615
- HE EXAGGERATES. IT WAS FOUR.
- IT WAS SIX.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.563
- FOUR.
- SIX.

24:48.588 --> 24:49.918
- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO ITALY?

24:49.956 --> 24:52.786
- UH, NO, BUT MY UNCLE VIC
SPENT A LOT OF TIME THERE.

24:52.825 --> 24:53.625
- OH, WAS HE ON BUSINESS?

24:53.660 --> 24:56.830
- NO, AIDS.
HE WENT THERE TO DIE.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.933
- OH.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.695
- I'M SORRY.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.203
- WELL,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.304
HE WAS REALLY SICK,
SO HE DECIDED

25:04.336 --> 25:07.936
TO TAKE THIS DREAM TRIP
TO ROME,

25:07.974 --> 25:10.144
AND THEN THE PROTEASE INHIBITORS
KICKED IN AND--

25:10.176 --> 25:11.936
NOW HE'S AT HOME,
AND HE'S FINE...

BUT, YOU KNOW--WELL,
HE WORKS SO HARD, AND, UH--

25:25.291 --> 25:26.761
- SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU DO,
MICHAEL?

25:26.793 --> 25:29.833
- UM, I'M IN RETAIL.

25:29.862 --> 25:30.762
- REALLY? WHERE?

25:30.797 --> 25:33.967
- UM, THE BIG "Q."

25:34.000 --> 25:36.200
- HE JUST GOT A PROMOTION.
HE'S A MANAGER.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.165
- THE BIG "Q"?

25:38.204 --> 25:39.774
EDDIE, ISN'T THAT
WHAT PEOPLE CALL YOU?

25:39.806 --> 25:43.306
[laughter]

25:43.342 --> 25:46.652
- I'VE SEEN THOSE STORES, BUT
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN IN ONE.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.649
- THEY SELL EVERYTHING
YOU CAN IMAGINE.

25:48.681 --> 25:52.221
- BUT NOTHING
YOU'D WANT TO BUY.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.059

30:50.249 --> 30:52.989

FOR THE LADIES.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.489
- [chuckles]

30:54.520 --> 30:56.560
OH, I ALWAYS LEAVE TIME
FOR THE LADIES.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.488
- BUT DON'T LET 'EM
TIE YOU DOWN, YOU HEAR?

30:58.524 --> 30:59.964
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,
POP.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.332
- 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
THEY ALL WANT TO DO,

31:01.360 --> 31:02.960
NO MATTER WHAT THE HELL
THEY SAY.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.925
- I THINK
I CAN HANDLE IT.

31:11.337 --> 31:14.237
- YOU KNOW, YOU...

31:14.273 --> 31:18.143
AND ME, WE--
WE'RE A LOT ALIKE.

31:18.177 --> 31:21.077
- WE ARE.

31:21.113 --> 31:23.123

TO SETTLE DOWN.

31:23.149 --> 31:25.989
- [chuckles]

31:26.018 --> 31:28.148
- SOMETIMES, GOD DAMN IT,
I LOOK IN THE MIRROR,

31:28.187 --> 31:30.687
AND I SAY, "JACK KINNEY,
YOU DUMB SON OF A BITCH,

31:30.722 --> 31:35.032
YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
A FAMILY MAN."

31:35.061 --> 31:37.361
- [chuckles]
THEN WHY DID YOU?

31:37.396 --> 31:40.526
WHY'D YOU MARRY MOM?
WHY'D YOU HAVE ME?

31:44.170 --> 31:46.510
- JESUS,
YOU'RE A SMART KID.

31:46.538 --> 31:48.668
YOU MEAN YOU NEVER
FIGURED IT OUT?

31:48.707 --> 31:52.477
NOW, COME ON, SONNY BOY.
SONNY BOY!

31:52.511 --> 31:55.411
YOU JUST STAY.

COME ON, HAVE ANOTHER DRINK
WITH YOUR OLD MAN.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.490
COME ON,
HAVE ANOTHER DRINK.

32:04.523 --> 32:07.963
TWO MORE.

32:15.234 --> 32:17.074
- EVERYONE THINKS
I'VE GONE SCHIZO.

32:17.103 --> 32:19.373
- NEVER BEEN SO HUMILIATED
IN MY LIFE.

32:20.672 --> 32:21.712
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:21.740 --> 32:22.570
- DELETING YOU.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.578
LIKE I SHOULD HAVE DONE
TO BEGIN WITH.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.580
- WHOA.

32:26.612 --> 32:30.052
DON'T I GET
ONE LAST CHANCE?

32:30.082 --> 32:31.382
THINK OF ALL THE HOT SEX
YOU'VE SCORED

32:31.417 --> 32:34.347
PRETENDING TO BE ME.

32:39.758 --> 32:42.058
COME INTO MY WORLD.

32:42.094 --> 32:45.764
- YOU DON'T HAVE A WORLD.
YOU HAVE A WEB.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.967
- SIGN ON.

32:50.369 --> 32:51.999
- ALL RIGHT,

32:52.038 --> 32:54.508
BUT THIS IS
YOUR LAST CHANCE.

33:23.702 --> 33:26.672
SO...WHICH ONE
DO WE WANT TO TALK TO?

33:32.578 --> 33:34.778
- HIM, SURFER DUDE.

33:34.813 --> 33:37.623
SO HOW'S IT GOING?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:37.649 --> 33:40.349
HE CAN'T HEAR YOU.
YOU DON'T EXIST HERE, REMEMBER?

33:40.386 --> 33:43.816
YOU'VE GOT TO TALK
THROUGH ME.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.525
- ALL RIGHT. WOW, GIVE
A SCREEN NAME A LITTLE POWER,

33:46.558 --> 33:49.198
HE BECOMES
A CONTROL FREAK.

33:49.228 --> 33:51.398
ASK HIM
WHAT HE'S GOT ON.

33:51.430 --> 33:54.300
- WHAT ARE YOU WEARING,
MAN?

33:55.567 --> 33:57.097
- JUST THE JOCKSTRAP.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.396
- WOW. [chuckles]

33:58.437 --> 33:59.337
IF LIFE WERE
LIKE THE INTERNET,

33:59.371 --> 34:01.311
HALF OF PITTSBURGH
WOULD BE NAKED. [laughs]

34:01.340 --> 34:03.640
ASK HIM WHAT HE'S INTO.
- WHAT ARE YOU INTO?

34:03.675 --> 34:08.105
- JACKING OFF, SUCKING,
JUST FOR STARTERS.

34:08.147 --> 34:10.447
- I COULD GET INTO THAT.

34:10.482 --> 34:13.522
- TELL HIM, UM--
- I KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

34:13.552 --> 34:17.562
IT'S WHAT
YOU ALWAYS SAY.

34:17.589 --> 34:18.518
I'LL THROW YOU
DOWN ON THE BED

34:18.556 --> 34:20.427
AND RIP THAT JOCK-STRAP OFF
WITH MY TEETH.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.559
- YOU'RE MAKING ME
SO HARD.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.204
- THEN I'D FLIP YOU OVER
AND I'D SLAP THAT TIGHT,

34:24.230 --> 34:27.370
ROUND BUBBLE BUTT
UNTIL YOU BEG ME TO FUCK...YOU.

34:27.399 --> 34:30.139

- HEY, PITTS, IT'S ME.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

- OH, MY GOD,
IT'S "USEMYHOLE27."

34:41.847 --> 34:43.717
- YEAH, I'LL TELL HIM
TO FUCK OFF. WE'RE BUSY.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.719

YOUR BOTTOM BOY.

I'LL COME OVER.

OKAY.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.623
HEY, DON'T CLEAN UP.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.915

AFTER THE MESS I MADE.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.487
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
THAT JAVIER NEVER TOLD ED

35:28.527 --> 35:29.827

I'VE NEVER BEEN ANYWHERE,

35:38.270 --> 35:39.910
I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING.
- SO WHAT?

35:39.938 --> 35:41.538

THROUGH ONE SEMESTER

35:41.573 --> 35:43.643
OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE.
- SO WHAT?

35:43.675 --> 35:45.675

WHICH FUCKING FORK TO USE.

35:45.711 --> 35:47.781

TAKE ONE LOOK AT ME,
AND LAUGH, RIGHT IN MY FACE.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.201

HE THOUGHT I WAS YOU.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.642
I'M THE CYRANO

I MEAN, I GUESS YOU CAN TELL
I'M NOT A BIG, BEEFY TOP.

YOU CHANGED HIM.

43:00.311 --> 43:03.951
I DID. MAYBE THAT NEW FORMULA
DOESN'T AGREE WITH HIM.

43:03.982 --> 43:09.092
[baby crying]

43:09.120 --> 43:12.190

43:59.337 --> 44:01.167
