<b>Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...</b>

00:09.120 --> 00:12.570
<b>Vast riches... Hidden treasures...</b>

00:14.670 --> 00:18.280
<b>Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...</b>

00:20.140 --> 00:23.230
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.230 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.790 --> 00:29.590
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.310 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

01:57.200 --> 02:01.550
<b>We will now take you to the exam site.</b>

02:01.550 --> 02:05.060
<b>Isn't it great that we all passed?</b>

02:05.060 --> 02:07.020
<b>It's too early to celebrate.</b>

02:07.020 --> 02:09.730
<b>We've merely earned the right 
to take the real exam.</b>

02:09.730 --> 02:11.120
<b>What's wrong with celebrating a little?</b>

02:11.120 --> 02:13.320
<b>We're making progress.</b>

02:13.320 --> 02:18.320
<b>Rivals x For x Survival</b>

02:20.840 --> 02:25.720
<b>Zaban City</b>

02:22.890 --> 02:26.670
<b>Gon and his new friends have arrived in Zaban City,</b>

02:26.670 --> 02:28.330
<b>site of the Hunter Exam,</b>

02:28.330 --> 02:31.330
<b>aided by the Kiriko Navigators.</b>

02:31.810 --> 02:36.090
<b>As Navigators, our job is to identify 
worthy Hunter applicants</b>

02:36.090 --> 02:39.090
<b>and guide them to the exam site.</b>

02:39.550 --> 02:44.110
<b>In other words, it would be extremely 
difficult for someone to reach the site</b>

02:44.110 --> 02:45.970
<b>without a Navigator's help.</b>

02:46.370 --> 02:48.100
<b>Hey, wanna try one?</b>

02:48.490 --> 02:51.350
<b>It's Zaban's famous panda-frog-on-a-stick!</b>

02:51.350 --> 02:53.230
<b>A true delicacy!</b>

02:53.670 --> 02:56.980
<b>This brooch was excavated from 
Zaban's underground palace.</b>

02:57.350 --> 02:58.760
<b>I bet that it's a national treasure.</b>

02:59.490 --> 03:03.620
<b>You know, Zaban City is quite a shady place.</b>

03:03.620 --> 03:09.250
<b>Prosperous cities tend to attract 
all sorts of nasty types.</b>

03:16.680 --> 03:18.490
<b>What are you doing, Gon?</b>

03:18.490 --> 03:19.260
<b>We're going!</b>

03:19.760 --> 03:20.580
<b>Yeah!</b>

03:29.760 --> 03:30.980
<b>I believe</b>

03:31.640 --> 03:33.480
<b>that is the building.</b>

03:33.480 --> 03:34.860
<b>Huh?</b>

03:39.170 --> 03:40.720
<b>It's so tall!</b>

03:40.720 --> 03:42.860
<b>They have a really nice building.</b>

03:43.420 --> 03:45.990
<b>So this is the exam site...</b>

03:47.990 --> 03:51.000
<b>This is what draws...</b>

03:51.420 --> 03:54.750
<b>Hunter applicants from across the world.</b>

03:56.750 --> 03:59.210
<b>My first shot at the Hunter Exam...</b>

03:59.210 --> 04:02.040
<b>Was this how Dad felt, when he first arrived?</b>

04:02.880 --> 04:03.760
<b>Hey, guys!</b>

04:03.760 --> 04:04.800
<b>Hmm?</b>

04:04.800 --> 04:05.990
<b>Over here.</b>

04:05.990 --> 04:06.640
<b>What?</b>

04:07.470 --> 04:08.640
<b>Here.</b>

04:12.640 --> 04:15.080
<b>Wait, this isn't funny.</b>

04:15.080 --> 04:17.810
<b>Isn't that an ordinary restaurant?</b>

04:17.810 --> 04:21.280
<b>You can't possibly mean that Hunter 
applicants from around the world</b>

04:21.280 --> 04:24.060
<b>are meant to assemble here?</b>

04:24.060 --> 04:25.520
<b>I do.</b>

04:25.520 --> 04:26.280
<b>Huh?</b>

04:26.870 --> 04:30.030
<b>No one would ever expect the Hunter Exam,</b>

04:30.030 --> 04:33.730
<b>with its millions of candidates, 
to be located here, right?</b>

04:33.730 --> 04:35.060
<b>That's true.</b>

04:39.230 --> 04:40.730
<b>Welcome!</b>

04:40.730 --> 04:42.550
<b>Is the back room open?</b>

04:42.550 --> 04:44.420
<b>What will you have?</b>

04:44.420 --> 04:48.100
<b>The steak combo that opens 
your eyes to the light.</b>

04:48.100 --> 04:49.300
<b>For three.</b>

04:49.840 --> 04:51.720
<b>For three...</b>

04:51.720 --> 04:53.170
<b>How would you like them?</b>

04:54.170 --> 04:57.440
<b>Grilled over a low flame, until cooked.</b>

04:57.440 --> 05:00.210
<b>Got it. Let yourself into the back room.</b>

05:05.550 --> 05:06.810
<b>Wait here.</b>

05:06.810 --> 05:08.050
<b>Wait?</b>

05:08.050 --> 05:09.520
<b>Where are the others?</b>

05:09.520 --> 05:11.460
<b>I can't wait for the steak combo.</b>

05:12.200 --> 05:16.710
<b>Gon, that was just the password 
to get us inside.</b>

05:16.710 --> 05:20.010
<b>Oh, we don't get to eat?</b>

05:20.010 --> 05:22.100
<b>One in every ten thousand...</b>

05:22.100 --> 05:22.710
<b>Hmm?</b>

05:23.420 --> 05:27.090
<b>The number of applicants 
who make it this far.</b>

05:27.790 --> 05:31.000
<b>You've done extremely well for first-timers.</b>

05:31.000 --> 05:32.720
<b>Well, good luck.</b>

05:33.720 --> 05:35.130
<b>Thanks!</b>

05:41.080 --> 05:45.070
<b>I would be happy to serve as your 
Navigator next year, as well.</b>

05:49.350 --> 05:50.740
<b>What?</b>

05:52.300 --> 05:55.660
<b>It appears this room is an elevator.</b>

06:00.430 --> 06:02.000
<b>Bastard...</b>

06:02.000 --> 06:06.260
<b>That meant that he expects us 
to fail this year.</b>

06:06.260 --> 06:08.330
<b>Once every three years.</b>

06:08.330 --> 06:09.260
<b>What's that?</b>

06:09.260 --> 06:11.920
<b>The frequency with which a 
rookie passes the exam.</b>

06:11.920 --> 06:12.990
<b>Huh?</b>

06:12.990 --> 06:14.770
<b>It's that unusual?</b>

06:15.320 --> 06:17.680
<b>Some cannot endure</b>

06:17.680 --> 06:20.220
<b>the exam's physical and mental strain.</b>

06:20.220 --> 06:22.250
<b>It's also not unusual for veterans</b>

06:22.250 --> 06:26.150
<b>to break the rookies, 
who consequently never retake the test.</b>

06:26.520 --> 06:30.910
<b>So I guess candidates are willing to risk 
everything to become Hunters.</b>

06:31.260 --> 06:33.830
<b>But of course, my friend!</b>

06:34.460 --> 06:38.360
<b>Hunters make the most money in this world!</b>

06:38.710 --> 06:39.580
<b>No!</b>

06:40.090 --> 06:43.670
<b>Hunters are the most noble in this world.</b>

06:44.080 --> 06:45.750
<b>Glory hog...</b>

06:45.750 --> 06:47.450
<b>Money grubber!</b>

06:50.960 --> 06:52.940
<b>Gon! Listen...</b>

06:52.940 --> 06:55.560
<b>Every year, over fifty Hunters</b>

06:55.560 --> 06:59.940
<b>make the list of the world's 
hundred richest people!</b>

07:02.890 --> 07:06.980
<b>Hunters are associated with 
hunting wild game and treasure,</b>

07:06.980 --> 07:08.280
<b>but they are all second-rate.</b>

07:08.730 --> 07:13.530
<b>True Hunters work to protect 
people and the natural order.</b>

07:14.030 --> 07:15.110
<b>Now, look here...</b>

07:15.110 --> 07:17.980
<b>Once you're a Hunter, most countries 
will give you a free pass!</b>

07:17.980 --> 07:19.410
<b>And no charge to use public facilities.</b>

07:19.720 --> 07:21.600
<b>How are those benefits?</b>

07:24.070 --> 07:26.990
<b>Hunters have many difficult and 
important responsibilities,</b>

07:26.990 --> 07:30.070
<b>such as preserving cultural artifacts 
and endangered species,</b>

07:30.070 --> 07:32.590
<b>as well as capturing wanted criminals 
and unscrupulous Hunters.</b>

07:32.590 --> 07:34.120
<b>The fame and money...</b>

07:34.120 --> 07:36.180
<b>That's why people wish to become Hunters!</b>

07:36.180 --> 07:38.730
<b>Profound knowledge, a healthy mind and body,</b>

07:38.730 --> 07:39.930
<b>and unyielding conviction...</b>

07:39.930 --> 07:41.940
<b>Those are the qualities on which 
Hunters pride themselves!</b>

07:43.850 --> 07:46.330
<b>Gon! What do you think?</b>

07:46.330 --> 07:48.730
<b>Which kind of Hunter do you 
hope to become?!</b>

07:49.090 --> 07:51.950
<b>Well, when you put it that way...</b>

07:54.370 --> 07:55.980
<b>I think we've arrived.</b>

07:55.980 --> 07:57.960
<b>We'll continue this later.</b>

08:13.290 --> 08:16.100
<b>Strange atmosphere down here.</b>

08:16.580 --> 08:19.270
<b>They clearly differ from the 
Hunter applicants we saw</b>

08:19.270 --> 08:20.720
<b>at the port and in the city.</b>

08:22.190 --> 08:25.850
<b>Each is a master, in their own right...</b>

08:26.540 --> 08:27.550
<b>Excuse me...</b>

08:31.000 --> 08:34.110
<b>Everyone's really tense.</b>

08:34.610 --> 08:38.250
<b>Hello. Please take a number.</b>

08:40.090 --> 08:41.120
<b>Here you go.</b>

08:42.860 --> 08:43.870
<b>Here.</b>

08:44.380 --> 08:47.660
<b>Be sure you wear this on 
your chest at all times.</b>

08:47.660 --> 08:49.760
<b>Be careful not to lose it.</b>

08:51.320 --> 08:53.630
<b>Haven't seen you guys around before.</b>

08:57.710 --> 08:58.640
<b>Yo.</b>

08:59.770 --> 09:01.680
<b>You can tell we're new?</b>

09:01.680 --> 09:02.890
<b>More or less.</b>

09:05.660 --> 09:09.730
<b>After all, this will be my thirty-fifth attempt.</b>

09:10.190 --> 09:12.110
<b>Thirty-five times?!</b>

09:12.110 --> 09:15.360
<b>Well, you could say I'm an exam veteran.</b>

09:15.970 --> 09:17.920
<b>That isn't something to brag about.</b>

09:17.920 --> 09:19.870
<b>Indeed.</b>

09:20.180 --> 09:23.380
<b>If you have any questions, 
feel free to ask me.</b>

09:23.380 --> 09:24.530
<b>Thank you.</b>

09:24.530 --> 09:26.290
<b>My name is Tonpa.</b>

09:26.290 --> 09:27.370
<b>I'm Gon.</b>

09:28.030 --> 09:30.400
<b>These are Kurapika and Leorio.</b>

09:32.030 --> 09:34.050
<b>Hey, are there others who</b>

09:34.050 --> 09:37.380
<b>have taken the exam a bunch 
of times like you?</b>

09:37.830 --> 09:40.580
<b>Well, I have the most experience here,</b>

09:40.580 --> 09:42.250
<b>but there are a few others.</b>

09:42.250 --> 09:43.970
<b>For instance, there's him...</b>

09:44.570 --> 09:46.280
<b>Number 255,</b>

09:46.280 --> 09:47.980
<b>Todo, the wrestler.</b>

09:48.580 --> 09:50.570
<b>He's unmatched in strength.</b>

09:50.570 --> 09:52.230
<b>And he's smarter than he looks.</b>

09:52.810 --> 09:54.680
<b>On the other side, we have number 103,</b>

09:54.680 --> 09:56.320
<b>Bourbon, the snake charmer.</b>

09:56.320 --> 09:58.530
<b>He tends to hold grudges,</b>

09:58.530 --> 10:00.680
<b>so you don't want to end up on his bad side.</b>

10:00.680 --> 10:02.000
<b>And then...</b>

10:02.440 --> 10:05.460
<b>Number 191, Bodoro, 
the kung fu master.</b>

10:05.460 --> 10:09.000
<b>He's getting old, but there still isn't 
a better martial artist around.</b>

10:09.910 --> 10:13.510
<b>Then you have the three brothers, 
Amori, Imori, and Umori.</b>

10:13.510 --> 10:15.090
<b>They perform consistently well,</b>

10:15.090 --> 10:17.010
<b>thanks to their excellent teamwork.</b>

10:18.040 --> 10:22.080
<b>And number 384, Gerreta, 
the huntsman.</b>

10:22.080 --> 10:23.510
<b>He specializes in killing</b>

10:23.510 --> 10:26.020
<b>all manner of creatures, 
by blow dart and club.</b>

10:26.760 --> 10:28.130
<b>There are many more,</b>

10:28.130 --> 10:29.980
<b>but they have taken the test 
the most times.</b>

10:29.980 --> 10:31.020
<b>Ah...</b>

10:55.190 --> 10:57.650
<b>Oh, how peculiar...</b>

10:57.650 --> 11:00.930
<b>His arms seem to have become flower petals.</b>

11:01.650 --> 11:04.430
<b>No smoke and mirrors here.</b>

11:07.380 --> 11:09.300
<b>Do take care.</b>

11:09.300 --> 11:12.440
<b>When you bump into someone, 
you really should apologize.</b>

11:15.450 --> 11:18.260
<b>That psychopath is back again.</b>

11:18.260 --> 11:19.450
<b>Again?</b>

11:20.150 --> 11:22.450
<b>Does that mean he took last year's exam?</b>

11:22.920 --> 11:25.950
<b>Number 44. Hisoka, the magician.</b>

11:26.460 --> 11:29.760
<b>Last year, he was a virtual 
lock to pass the test,</b>

11:29.760 --> 11:32.500
<b>until he all but killed an examiner he didn't like.</b>

11:33.020 --> 11:37.870
<b>A-And they're still allowing him to 
retake the exam this year?</b>

11:37.870 --> 11:39.490
<b>Of course.</b>

11:39.490 --> 11:42.600
<b>Every year, the examiners and 
test content change,</b>

11:42.600 --> 11:45.260
<b>and the examiners are the ones 
who choose the new content.</b>

11:46.850 --> 11:51.660
<b>The devil himself could pass if that were 
the examiners' determination.</b>

11:51.660 --> 11:53.760
<b>That's just how the Hunter Exam works.</b>

11:54.650 --> 11:58.100
<b>Anyway, no one likes him.</b>

11:58.100 --> 11:59.530
<b>You should stay away, too.</b>

12:00.780 --> 12:03.530
<b>He looks dangerous. 
That much is for sure.</b>

12:03.980 --> 12:06.030
<b>Oh, right...</b>

12:06.030 --> 12:08.390
<b>A little something to mark our acquaintance.</b>

12:08.390 --> 12:09.720
<b>How about it?</b>

12:09.720 --> 12:12.290
<b>Oh, appreciated.</b>

12:13.960 --> 12:16.790
<b>As it happened, I was thirsty...</b>

12:16.790 --> 12:18.200
<b>Thanks!</b>

12:18.200 --> 12:19.250
<b>Thank you.</b>

12:20.130 --> 12:20.990
<b>There he goes.</b>

12:21.720 --> 12:23.540
<b>He always plays the nice guy,</b>

12:23.540 --> 12:25.990
<b>despite being nastier than 
anyone else here.</b>

12:25.990 --> 12:27.960
<b>Tonpa, the rookie crusher...</b>

12:27.960 --> 12:32.270
<b>Best of luck to all of us!</b>

12:38.040 --> 12:43.030
<b><i>The juice I gave you contains an 
extremely strong laxative.</i></b>

12:43.770 --> 12:45.640
<b><i>One sip, and for three days,</i></b>

12:45.640 --> 12:48.290
<b><i>your guts will be a non-stop roller coaster.</i></b>

12:48.790 --> 12:53.630
<b><i>You'll need diapers to take the exam.</i></b>

12:57.060 --> 13:07.140
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

13:02.950 --> 13:07.140
<b>Leorio</b>

13:17.130 --> 13:20.170
<b>Tonpa-san, this juice must have expired.</b>

13:20.170 --> 13:21.250
<b>It tastes funny.</b>

13:22.610 --> 13:23.830
<b>Seriously?</b>

13:23.830 --> 13:25.200
<b>That was close!</b>

13:25.620 --> 13:28.820
<b>H-Huh? That's strange...</b>

13:29.780 --> 13:30.720
<b><i>Impossible!</i></b>

13:30.720 --> 13:33.830
<b><i>That laxative should have 
practically no taste nor scent.</i></b>

13:36.660 --> 13:38.610
<b>I'm very sorry!</b>

13:38.610 --> 13:40.960
<b>I didn't realize the juice had gone bad.</b>

13:41.360 --> 13:43.840
<b>It's okay. You don't have to apologize.</b>

13:43.840 --> 13:46.050
<b>Is your stomach okay?</b>

13:46.050 --> 13:48.470
<b>Y-Yes... I'm fine.</b>

13:48.830 --> 13:53.270
<b>I've sampled all kinds of mountain 
grasses and plants.</b>

13:53.610 --> 13:56.230
<b>So I can usually taste when something's bad.</b>

13:56.230 --> 13:58.650
<b>R-Really?</b>

13:58.650 --> 14:00.480
<b>That's amazing...</b>

14:01.220 --> 14:04.740
<b><i>Damn... I had to run into 
this wild mountain kid.</i></b>

14:05.890 --> 14:07.490
<b>Sorry about that again.</b>

14:07.490 --> 14:09.190
<b>I'll see you around.</b>

14:09.940 --> 14:11.740
<b>Talkative old man...</b>

14:12.980 --> 14:17.000
<b><i>Still, there's something wrong

14:17.890 --> 14:20.790
<b><i>That number 294, Hanzo, too.</i></b>

14:21.770 --> 14:26.030
<b><i>He seemed gullible when I approached him.</i></b>

14:26.900 --> 14:28.600
<b><i>Don't tell anyone else,</i></b>

14:28.600 --> 14:30.730
<b><i>but I'm actually a ninja.</i></b>

14:30.730 --> 14:31.550
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

14:31.550 --> 14:32.800
<b><i>Oh, really?</i></b>

14:32.800 --> 14:35.790
<b><i>I seek the legendary scroll... Shh...</i></b>

14:35.790 --> 14:41.520
<b><i>The Ultimate Ninja Scroll. 
That is why I desire to become a Hunter.</i></b>

14:41.960 --> 14:44.750
<b><i>I've heard that it's hidden somewhere</i></b>

14:44.750 --> 14:47.530
<b><i>inaccessible to ordinary people.</i></b>

14:48.060 --> 14:51.020
<b><i>Anyway, it's boring here...</i></b>

14:51.020 --> 14:54.070
<b><i>Yeah, I guess... So, how about it?</i></b>

14:54.070 --> 14:55.540
<b><i>Let's toast our new friendship.</i></b>

14:58.190 --> 15:00.500
<b><i>As a ninja, I make it a point</i></b>

15:00.500 --> 15:04.130
<b><i>to never drink anything someone else offers.</i></b>

15:05.250 --> 15:06.450
<b><i>Sorry.</i></b>

15:07.470 --> 15:09.420
<b><i>I-I see...</i></b>

15:13.180 --> 15:15.970
<b><i>I could tell by his eyes that he's no fool.</i></b>

15:15.970 --> 15:18.140
<b><i>One false step, and I could've 
been in real danger.</i></b>

15:21.830 --> 15:24.650
<b><i>Speaking of danger, there's number 301...</i></b>

15:25.040 --> 15:30.150
<b><i>That guy just oozes peril. 
I can't even go near him.</i></b>

15:30.860 --> 15:33.410
<b><i>Then there's that guy I can't stand,</i></b>

15:34.690 --> 15:37.410
<b><i>number 187, Nicolas.</i></b>

15:39.820 --> 15:42.920
<b><i>Must've been tough to make it here.</i></b>

15:43.450 --> 15:47.420
<b><i>Not really. Everything went 
as predicted by my data...</i></b>

15:47.730 --> 15:49.910
<b><i>I used historical data,</i></b>

15:49.910 --> 15:52.930
<b><i>from past Hunter Exams, 
to calculate this year's location.</i></b>

15:53.340 --> 15:55.310
<b><i>Quite simple.</i></b>

15:55.310 --> 15:57.100
<b><i>Frankly, I was bored senseless.</i></b>

15:57.540 --> 16:00.860
<b><i>R-Really... That's amazing.</i></b>

16:00.860 --> 16:03.400
<b><i>My name is Tonpa. Nice to meet you.</i></b>

16:03.400 --> 16:05.050
<b><i>Tonpa-san, is it?</i></b>

16:06.120 --> 16:07.610
<b><i>Oh, there you are.</i></b>

16:08.160 --> 16:10.830
<b><i>This is your thirty-fifth attempt,</i></b>

16:10.830 --> 16:13.360
<b><i>the second-highest number by one person.</i></b>

16:13.890 --> 16:18.570
<b><i>And with thirty, you have the most 
consecutive appearances.</i></b>

16:18.570 --> 16:20.100
<b><i>Very impressive.</i></b>

16:20.100 --> 16:22.180
<b><i>Please, it's no big deal.</i></b>

16:22.180 --> 16:24.920
<b><i>How about it? 
Let's drink to our new friendship...</i></b>

16:24.920 --> 16:30.130
<b><i>But you have yet to actually pass the exam.</i></b>

16:30.980 --> 16:32.920
<b><i>I assume that's because</i></b>

16:32.920 --> 16:35.540
<b><i>you're too absorbed by your other objective.</i></b>

16:35.540 --> 16:36.140
<b><i>Eh?</i></b>

16:36.870 --> 16:39.140
<b><i>Tonpa-san, the rookie crusher.</i></b>

16:39.580 --> 16:40.800
<b><i>What?</i></b>

16:44.110 --> 16:47.780
<b><i>Well, I won't share my knowledge 
with anyone else,</i></b>

16:47.780 --> 16:51.220
<b><i>seeing as you hold the consecutive 
appearance record...</i></b>

16:51.740 --> 16:52.610
<b><i>Goodbye.</i></b>

17:00.220 --> 17:02.410
<b><i>Bastard... Just you wait.</i></b>

17:03.150 --> 17:06.300
<b><i>I'll break that snotty nose of yours.</i></b>

17:07.470 --> 17:09.250
<b>Hey, Tonpa-san!</b>

17:09.670 --> 17:12.430
<b>Could I have more of that juice?</b>

17:13.080 --> 17:14.960
<b>Must be my nerves.</b>

17:14.960 --> 17:16.180
<b>I'm really thirsty.</b>

17:16.490 --> 17:17.470
<b>Eh?</b>

17:17.470 --> 17:19.140
<b>Oh, sure...</b>

17:20.000 --> 17:21.170
<b><i>What the hell?</i></b>

17:21.170 --> 17:24.770
<b><i>The laxative he drank earlier should 
have taken effect by now.</i></b>

17:25.660 --> 17:28.270
<b><i>What's going on?</i></b>

17:34.540 --> 17:36.690
<b><i>It's only a laxative,</i></b>

17:36.690 --> 17:41.270
<b><i>but if he imbibes that much, 
he could die of dehydration.</i></b>

17:42.310 --> 17:43.290
<b>Worried?</b>

17:44.620 --> 17:47.670
<b>I'll be fine. I've trained.</b>

17:48.640 --> 17:50.080
<b>Poisons won't affect me.</b>

17:54.290 --> 17:55.170
<b>Poisons?</b>

17:55.950 --> 17:59.810
<b><i>He knew what was in the juice?</i></b>

17:59.810 --> 18:03.300
<b><i>But he still drank it?</i></b>

18:04.290 --> 18:06.690
<b><i>Number 99, Killua.</i></b>

18:07.480 --> 18:12.070
<b><i>This year's rookies are all insane...</i></b>

18:13.890 --> 18:15.430
<b><i>Well, it doesn't matter.</i></b>

18:15.430 --> 18:18.830
<b><i>That just means crushing them will 
be all the more worthwhile.</i></b>

18:49.660 --> 18:52.340
<b>I apologize for the wait.</b>

18:52.340 --> 18:58.360
<b>The entry period for 
Hunter applicants has ended.</b>

18:59.280 --> 19:03.870
<b>The Hunter Exam will now begin!</b>

19:10.420 --> 19:12.170
<b>A final caution.</b>

19:12.830 --> 19:15.360
<b>If you are short on luck or ability,</b>

19:15.360 --> 19:19.680
<b>you could very well end up</b>

19:19.680 --> 19:23.180
<b>seriously injured or even dead.</b>

19:24.350 --> 19:28.930
<b>Those who accept the risks, 
please follow me.</b>

19:29.720 --> 19:35.340
<b>Otherwise, please exit via 
the elevator behind you.</b>

19:45.350 --> 19:46.760
<b>Very well.</b>

19:47.320 --> 19:51.060
<b>All 404 applicants will participate in Phase One.</b>

20:10.160 --> 20:12.930
<b>Of course, no one turned around and left.</b>

20:12.930 --> 20:15.360
<b>I'd hoped a few might withdraw.</b>

20:27.500 --> 20:29.180
<b>Wh-What?</b>

20:29.180 --> 20:31.580
<b>The people in front started running.</b>

20:31.580 --> 20:33.870
<b>He's picked up the pace.</b>

20:34.390 --> 20:35.990
<b>I neglected to introduce myself.</b>

20:35.990 --> 20:40.880
<b>I am Satotz, the Phase One examiner.</b>

20:41.630 --> 20:45.890
<b>I shall lead you to the exam's Second Phase.</b>

20:46.290 --> 20:47.390
<b>Second Phase?</b>

20:47.390 --> 20:48.890
<b>What about Phase One?</b>

20:49.430 --> 20:52.020
<b>It has already commenced.</b>

20:52.720 --> 20:54.100
<b>It's already begun?</b>

20:54.100 --> 20:56.020
<b>This is part of the test?</b>

20:57.020 --> 21:00.950
<b>You must follow me to Phase Two.</b>

21:00.950 --> 21:03.320
<b>This is the exam's First Phase.</b>

21:03.920 --> 21:06.320
<b>Follow you? That's it?</b>

21:06.950 --> 21:07.700
<b>Yes.</b>

21:08.250 --> 21:11.330
<b>I cannot tell you where or 
when you must arrive.</b>

21:12.160 --> 21:14.330
<b>You need to follow me.</b>

21:17.970 --> 21:19.390
<b>I see how it is.</b>

21:19.390 --> 21:21.180
<b>This test is weird.</b>

21:21.180 --> 21:24.090
<b>I expect it's an endurance test.</b>

21:24.530 --> 21:26.280
<b>Fine by me.</b>

21:26.280 --> 21:28.350
<b>I'll be right behind you!</b>

21:29.480 --> 21:33.490
<b><i>But there is the mental stress 
of not knowing</i></b>

21:33.490 --> 21:35.850
<b><i>how far we'll have to run.</i></b>

21:36.550 --> 21:39.860
<b><i>He's also testing our mental fortitude.</i></b>

21:40.690 --> 21:44.360
<b>The exam's First Phase begins,</b>

21:44.880 --> 21:46.900
<b>amidst a mix of warriors and knaves.</b>

21:48.870 --> 21:51.550
<b>One candidate is disqualified 
before it even starts.</b>

21:51.910 --> 21:57.790
<b>The total number of Hunter 
applicants is 404.</b>

23:29.180 --> 23:31.560
<b>Next time: Hope x And x Ambition.</b>

23:31.560 --> 23:33.210
<b>Time to go fishin'!</b>

23:33.210 --> 23:33.920
<b>Yeah!</b>
