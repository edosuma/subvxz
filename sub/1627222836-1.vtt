02:37.816 --> 02:41.653
- God, why won't it stop?
- Just give it a second, will you?

02:42.737 --> 02:45.028
Where were you? You should have
been home by six.

02:45.030 --> 02:47.073
I told you guys I was doing
homework with Amy tonight.

02:47.075 --> 02:49.575
What happened there?
Did you hurt yourself?

02:49.577 --> 02:51.785
Amy's, uh, cat scratched me.
It's fine.

02:51.787 --> 02:53.913
- It's no big deal.
- Why weren't you answering my calls?

02:53.915 --> 02:57.668
Look I'm sorry, I just...

03:04.174 --> 03:05.260
I think it's an EF5.

03:06.886 --> 03:08.844
It's not a tornado, baby.

03:08.846 --> 03:11.012
- It might be an EF5.
- What the hell is an EF5?

03:11.014 --> 03:13.558
It's like when two tornadoes
come together,

03:13.560 --> 03:15.434
and they form one giant tornado.

03:15.436 --> 03:18.438
- It rips everything in its path.
- God, is that true?

03:18.440 --> 03:21.731
No, it's just a thunderstorm.
Everything's gonna be okay.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.028
Jesus, that was loud.

03:27.030 --> 03:28.575
It was a little loud.

03:29.909 --> 03:31.244
Sounded like a gunshot.

03:32.202 --> 03:35.036
Maybe it's an EF6. Wait.

03:35.038 --> 03:36.664
Is there even such a thing
as EF6?

03:36.666 --> 03:38.957
Baby, there's not gonna be
a tornado.

03:38.959 --> 03:41.421
It's just a thunderstorm,
and it's going to pass.

03:42.630 --> 03:44.674
Most things come to an end,
don't they?

04:00.440 --> 04:05.028
Mom, I think something
might be wrong.

04:06.154 --> 04:09.362
Like with the storm,
something bad might be happening.

04:09.364 --> 04:11.117
No, it'll pass.

04:18.832 --> 04:21.584
Who wants to play
The Great Hotel Escape?

04:21.586 --> 04:23.919
- You can never read the cards when we play that.
- I can read!

04:23.921 --> 04:26.005
- Guys...
- Mom, tell her I can read.

04:26.007 --> 04:27.339
Mel, your brother can read.

04:27.341 --> 04:29.633
See! I told you.

04:29.635 --> 04:31.385
- Mom, did you see what Mel...!
- Enough!

05:06.755 --> 05:08.549
- Who's that?
- Nobody.

05:09.550 --> 05:10.551
Right.

05:11.969 --> 05:15.555
Who wants to play
Goths and Vandals?

05:15.557 --> 05:18.474
- Not The Great Hotel Escape?
- Not right now, baby.

05:18.476 --> 05:22.102
Look we just pull out the Goths
and Vandals game.

05:22.104 --> 05:25.106
I bet you by the time we get
through the first round,

05:25.108 --> 05:27.190
the storm will've passed.

05:27.192 --> 05:29.152
Unless the tornado picks up
our house

05:29.154 --> 05:31.279
- and carries it away or something.
- Shut up!

05:31.281 --> 05:33.448
That only happened
in The Wizard of Oz.

05:33.450 --> 05:35.366
It could happen here too.

05:35.368 --> 05:36.577
God, you're so dumb.

05:38.454 --> 05:41.039
What did I tell you about talking
to your brother like that?

05:42.207 --> 05:43.417
Sorry.

05:45.043 --> 05:46.044
Are you?

06:05.356 --> 06:07.565
- Who's calling?
- It's just nobody.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.526
- Yeah, who's calling?
- Nobody!

06:10.195 --> 06:11.195
Huh!

06:13.156 --> 06:16.076
You really think this bathroom
is gonna protect us

06:17.074 --> 06:18.952
from a big, old tornado
that swoops in and...

06:20.163 --> 06:22.205
You really think it's gonna
make any difference at all?

06:22.207 --> 06:23.914
Well if you don't wanna be
in here with us,

06:23.916 --> 06:26.418
- you know where the door is.
- Oh! Now I have a choice.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.505
What is going on?

06:45.687 --> 06:47.813
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

06:47.815 --> 06:49.065
Why did the lights go out?

06:49.067 --> 06:52.025
You guys, it's a thunderstorm,

06:52.027 --> 06:54.986
Lightning probably hit
a transformer or something.

06:54.988 --> 06:56.823
Stop freaking out for no reason.

06:56.825 --> 06:59.032
It's a tornado!
It's a tornado! It's a tornado!

06:59.034 --> 07:02.413
...Bobby?

07:10.712 --> 07:12.755
Did lightning hit the house?!

07:12.757 --> 07:15.883
- What the hell was that? Oh, God, what was that?
- Jesus Christ.

07:15.885 --> 07:18.805
I don't know. I don't know.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.058
Dad no! Don't go.

07:25.060 --> 07:26.728
Just get the light, okay?

07:31.276 --> 07:32.776
What the fuck?

07:34.695 --> 07:37.656
- What's wrong?
- It won't open.

07:38.115 --> 07:40.116
What do you mean it won't open?

07:40.118 --> 07:42.620
I mean it won't fucking open!

07:44.748 --> 07:46.873
Melissa, give me your phone.

07:46.875 --> 07:49.711
- No. What? Why?
- Just give me the goddamn phone.

07:54.966 --> 07:57.927
Oh, what the fuck?

07:59.344 --> 08:00.554
God damn it!

08:01.346 --> 08:03.683
- What is it?
- A tree.

08:04.099 --> 08:07.310
- A what?
- I think a fucking tree

08:07.312 --> 08:09.436
- is blocking the door.
- Oh, God.

08:09.438 --> 08:12.106
What tree? You can't move it?

08:12.108 --> 08:15.445
Does it look like I can
move it? Fuck!

08:16.361 --> 08:18.447
Maybe it's a tree
from the backyard.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.532
- What?
- Where we buried Spot.

08:21.534 --> 08:23.325
- What?!
- Ugh!

08:23.327 --> 08:24.578
God damn it, Mel.

08:26.998 --> 08:29.748
- Is Spot dead?
- Let's talk about this in a minute, okay?

08:29.750 --> 08:32.876
- But Spot ran away!
- Spot ran away!

08:32.878 --> 08:34.421
God damn it.

08:41.970 --> 08:45.347
- Jesus Christ.
- Where's my phone?

08:45.349 --> 08:47.015
- Calm down.
- Dad, where's my phone?

08:47.017 --> 08:48.768
- I dropped it.
- Ugh!

08:48.770 --> 08:51.895
Would you stop being
hysterical? It's a storm.

08:51.897 --> 08:54.273
Amy is fine. Jesus Christ.

08:54.275 --> 08:56.317
It's not the end
of the goddamn world.

09:02.282 --> 09:04.786
Mel! Shut the door!

09:06.121 --> 09:07.579
Close the door!

09:17.214 --> 09:20.844
- Are we stuck?
- I don't know. The roof is gone.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.141
Oh, my God. Come here.

09:32.063 --> 09:33.731
What are we gonna do?

09:51.040 --> 09:53.543
We have to do something,
don't we?

09:56.838 --> 09:57.839
Don't we?

10:01.383 --> 10:02.384
Guys!

10:12.478 --> 10:13.979
I guess we wait.

10:18.776 --> 10:19.777
Amy...

11:18.877 --> 11:22.840
Hey, I was waiting for you
to stop,

11:24.258 --> 11:26.049
back by the bleachers?

11:26.051 --> 11:28.637
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.

11:30.305 --> 11:32.267
But you saw something else,
didn't you?

11:35.228 --> 11:39.190
- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to...
- Didn't mean to what?

11:41.233 --> 11:42.234
Stare?

11:43.777 --> 11:44.988
Maybe I wanted you to.

11:51.035 --> 11:52.036
What happened?

11:53.954 --> 11:55.165
I used to be a cutter.

12:01.963 --> 12:04.797
Why?

12:04.799 --> 12:06.217
Because I used to be dead.

12:37.873 --> 12:40.918
How bad is it? The tree?

12:57.017 --> 12:59.268
You think the insurance
will cover it?

13:03.690 --> 13:04.942
I don't know.

13:08.988 --> 13:10.739
You gonna try your phone
again?

13:13.575 --> 13:16.662
Wait, Dad, can I use
your phone? To call Amy.

13:18.831 --> 13:21.249
Something's wrong with it.
Try yours.

13:21.251 --> 13:22.209
Oh, I can't.

13:23.545 --> 13:26.214
- You can't?
- Yeah, I can't. It's dead.

13:27.132 --> 13:28.465
Oh, God damn it.

13:32.344 --> 13:34.180
Fucking piece of shit.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.305
- Uh...
- What?

13:37.307 --> 13:39.683
Well, I'm trying to check
the news,

13:39.685 --> 13:43.563
but this fucking thing
isn't working.

13:43.565 --> 13:45.689
Okay, well... Do you want me
to have a look at it?

13:45.691 --> 13:48.026
No, I don't want you to have
a look at it.

13:48.652 --> 13:50.403
Okay. I was just asking.

13:50.405 --> 13:52.156
Dad, can I please try
your phone?

13:53.491 --> 13:54.909
I have to pee.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.433
I can't go with you guys here.

14:22.896 --> 14:25.228
I don't know
what to tell you, Mel.

14:30.152 --> 14:31.861
I can still hear you pee, sis.

14:31.863 --> 14:35.075
Oh, my God, Bobby, Jesus!

14:43.333 --> 14:46.211
Wow, it was really an EF5.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.627
Yeah. It might have been.

14:48.629 --> 14:51.172
You guys think
it's over now?

14:51.174 --> 14:53.131
Do you think people died?

14:53.133 --> 14:54.467
No, baby, nobody died.

14:54.469 --> 14:55.552
It's very possible.

14:56.720 --> 14:57.721
Seriously?

15:02.017 --> 15:03.726
Hey, you guys! I see a snake!

15:03.728 --> 15:08.313
- What?! Bobby get away from there.
- Where?

15:08.315 --> 15:10.859
Over there, where the dressers
all smashed.

15:13.028 --> 15:14.196
I don't see anything.

15:15.239 --> 15:16.740
I think it's a rattlesnake.

15:17.575 --> 15:20.367
What do you know about
rattlesnakes?

15:20.369 --> 15:21.954
It's right there.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.874
Bobby, there's no snake.

15:30.546 --> 15:33.215
Bobby, get inside
and shut the door.

15:34.383 --> 15:36.469
Thank you.

15:45.185 --> 15:47.270
I saw a rattlesnake
on YouTube once.

15:47.272 --> 15:48.813
It was eating an alligator.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.356
What?

15:50.358 --> 15:53.275
No rattlesnake's ever eaten
an alligator.

15:53.277 --> 15:55.986
It was a baby alligator.

15:55.988 --> 15:58.448
Oh, well it was a baby
alligator, sure.

15:58.450 --> 16:00.116
Of course,
that makes perfect sense.

16:00.118 --> 16:01.867
You should have mentioned that
before.

16:01.869 --> 16:04.578
The only snakes that I ever met
in my life eat mice

16:04.580 --> 16:05.829
and other shit.

16:49.501 --> 16:52.334
- Don't look at me like that.
- Can't believe you dropped it.

16:52.336 --> 16:54.002
It was an accident.

16:54.004 --> 16:56.173
Well, how are we supposed to
get out of here now?

16:57.550 --> 16:59.634
I don't know.

16:59.636 --> 17:04.431
Can't we just break the door down?
What about the wall?

17:05.307 --> 17:08.391
- The wall?
- The wall or the door or whatever.

17:08.393 --> 17:11.439
Can't you just bust a hole
through it and crawl out?

17:12.815 --> 17:13.816
Can we just...

17:14.733 --> 17:17.734
- I don't... how? With what?
- I don't know.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.111
Can't you just punch through it
or something?

17:19.113 --> 17:20.612
No, I can't just punch
through it.

17:20.614 --> 17:22.534
That thing is made of solid oak.

17:23.410 --> 17:27.661
That is tempered glass blocks.
That is a rock wall.

17:27.663 --> 17:32.291
This is tile. These walls are
six feet thick.

17:32.293 --> 17:35.002
How the fuck are we supposed to
do that?

17:35.004 --> 17:36.379
You wanna break your hand?

17:36.381 --> 17:38.130
- Look, everyone...
- Be my guest.

17:38.132 --> 17:41.175
Everything's going to be fine.
It hasn't been that long.

17:41.177 --> 17:43.052
Someone will come.

17:43.054 --> 17:45.515
Jesus Christ, Pollyanna.

17:51.395 --> 17:54.648
What if it wasn't just a storm,
Mom?

18:26.639 --> 18:28.433
Is there anybody out there?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.086
- We need that.
- Need what?

18:59.005 --> 19:00.507
We need it to stay hydrated.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.261
But I'm not finished with it
yet.

19:08.305 --> 19:09.473
Well, can you be?

19:48.720 --> 19:50.345
Here, baby.

19:50.347 --> 19:52.473
- I washed it out, don't worry.
- But Mom...

19:52.475 --> 19:56.353
Just drink the water, Bobby!
Just drink it!

20:19.544 --> 20:21.796
What, I don't get any now?

20:25.382 --> 20:27.341
Relax, I'm just fucking around.

20:27.343 --> 20:29.679
What's the matter? You can't
take a joke any more?

20:34.350 --> 20:36.686
Hey, why don't you just chill out?

20:38.062 --> 20:40.479
Hey, I'm just messing around.

20:40.481 --> 20:42.189
Don't overreact
every time I say...

20:42.191 --> 20:44.065
Listen, God damn it.

20:44.067 --> 20:46.151
We have enough shit
piling up here

20:46.153 --> 20:48.696
- without your weight added to it.
- What are you talking about?

20:48.698 --> 20:50.363
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

20:50.365 --> 20:52.535
So don't try acting innocently
all of a sudden.

20:53.911 --> 20:57.537
- Dee...
- Look, you wanna fight? Fine.

20:57.539 --> 20:59.998
Save it for when this is
all over because right now,

21:00.000 --> 21:01.293
nobody wants to hear it.

21:16.267 --> 21:17.267
Whoa.

21:20.479 --> 21:24.191
No. You have a six?

21:24.734 --> 21:26.444
Yeah. Here.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.699
Mom, I'm hungry.

21:34.701 --> 21:35.828
Yeah, me too.

21:37.037 --> 21:38.205
I'm so sorry.

21:39.915 --> 21:42.707
I wish we'd brought some goldfish
crackers with us or something.

21:42.709 --> 21:45.002
Ugh! Goldfish crackers
are disgusting.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.548
Hmm. More for me then.

21:48.632 --> 21:52.843
I want some eggs.
I want a thousand eggs. With cheese.

21:52.845 --> 21:56.389
- Gross, only old people like eggs, Bobby.
- No, they don't.

21:56.391 --> 21:58.850
Mom, tell sis all types
of people like eggs.

21:58.852 --> 22:01.936
Melissa, all types of people
like eggs.

22:01.938 --> 22:04.354
Nuh-uh. Only old people.

22:04.356 --> 22:06.358
And you know what that
makes you, Bobby?

22:07.360 --> 22:10.861
- Don't say it...
- You know what that makes you?

22:10.863 --> 22:14.532
Mom, tell sis not to say it.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.868
- Melissa, don't say it.
- Okay, okay.

22:20.957 --> 22:23.416
It makes you a tiny, old man.

22:23.418 --> 22:27.836
Mom!

22:27.838 --> 22:30.299
Calm down. It's okay.

22:32.093 --> 22:36.680
- A tiny, old man.
- Stupid asshole.

22:37.473 --> 22:42.351
Fuck! Fuck!

22:42.353 --> 22:46.022
Fucking piece of shit!

22:46.024 --> 22:48.440
Stupid fucking battery!

22:48.442 --> 22:51.777
You fucking useless asshole
technology!

22:51.779 --> 22:55.075
You fucking cunt! Fuck you!

22:55.616 --> 22:59.534
You motherfucker!
Die, you fucking bitch!

22:59.536 --> 23:03.083
You stupid cunt! Fuck you!

23:03.708 --> 23:07.796
Fuck you in your ass!

23:27.565 --> 23:29.691
Why hasn't anybody come yet?

23:35.280 --> 23:36.532
I don't know.

23:42.997 --> 23:44.332
Not a tornado.

23:48.836 --> 23:49.837
Something else.

23:52.257 --> 23:53.298
You mean...?

23:56.885 --> 23:57.886
I think...

24:03.601 --> 24:05.353
I think...

24:10.775 --> 24:12.944
It doesn't make any sense.

24:16.573 --> 24:18.408
What doesn't make any sense?

24:19.241 --> 24:24.580
We have neighbors.
Someone would've come.

24:27.584 --> 24:28.584
Seen the tree.

24:30.836 --> 24:32.546
Why haven't they, Daddy?

24:34.966 --> 24:35.967
They're all dead.

24:37.469 --> 24:38.719
Why would you say that?

24:40.138 --> 24:45.852
Or they've already been
evacuated.

24:47.353 --> 24:52.859
Either way, it doesn't
bode too well for any of us.

25:40.364 --> 25:42.032
I used to be dead.

25:43.575 --> 25:48.789
Most people are.
They just don't realize it.

25:50.834 --> 25:51.834
What do you mean?

25:54.211 --> 25:59.217
They said I was crazy.
That I did it for attention.

26:02.636 --> 26:04.596
You ever heard
of Cotard delusion?

26:07.307 --> 26:09.266
No, I don't think so.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.561
Walking corpse syndrome.

26:13.314 --> 26:15.108
It's like a mental illness,
I guess.

26:16.860 --> 26:19.487
People become convinced that
they're actually really dead.

26:32.417 --> 26:35.376
Is that why you used to cut
yourself?

26:35.378 --> 26:40.633
If I could still bleed, then maybe I
could remind myself that it wasn't real,

26:42.218 --> 26:43.553
that I was still alive.

26:49.183 --> 26:50.392
Did you want to be?

26:52.394 --> 26:57.150
When you would cut yourself,
what were you hoping to see?

27:47.700 --> 27:51.034
Mel, that's starting to look
infected.

27:51.036 --> 27:52.495
It's fine.

27:52.497 --> 27:55.372
I'm gonna put something on it,
okay?

27:55.374 --> 27:58.376
Mom, Dad, I'm hungry.

27:58.378 --> 28:00.588
Okay, I don't know
what to say about that.

28:03.007 --> 28:05.925
I want an omelet
with ham and cheese.

28:05.927 --> 28:08.888
But Sissy doesn't get any
cheese, you hear that, sis?

28:10.265 --> 28:12.348
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What, what, what, what?

28:12.350 --> 28:13.932
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh,
my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

28:13.934 --> 28:15.685
Bobby, you stay there.

28:15.687 --> 28:17.352
- What the f...
- Oh, Jesus. What?

28:19.274 --> 28:22.190
- Bobby, get in the tub!
- Oh, my God!

28:22.192 --> 28:25.529
- Okay, okay. Stay there. Stay there.
- Oh, my God.

28:26.072 --> 28:27.449
Shit!

28:28.074 --> 28:30.658
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

28:30.660 --> 28:32.159
Okay. Okay, I'm coming to you.
Hold on.

28:32.161 --> 28:34.245
- Oh, my God.
- Robert...

28:34.247 --> 28:36.456
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

28:36.458 --> 28:40.042
- Oh, my God. What the fuck?
- What do I do? What do I do?

28:40.044 --> 28:41.627
Just don't move.

28:41.629 --> 28:43.254
Jesus!

28:44.716 --> 28:46.716
- Oh, my God!
- Christ!

28:46.718 --> 28:49.217
- Did it bite you?
- No, I don't think so.

28:49.219 --> 28:50.220
Okay.

28:51.096 --> 28:52.679
Dad be careful.

28:52.681 --> 28:55.515
Oh, shit. Robert, are you okay?

28:58.103 --> 28:59.898
Mel, throw me that plunger.

29:00.856 --> 29:02.189
Mel, careful.

29:02.191 --> 29:04.399
Shit, I'm sorry. Fuck.

29:04.401 --> 29:07.736
- Jesus, Jesus.
- Shit, shit, shit.

29:07.738 --> 29:09.406
Okay. Okay.

29:10.616 --> 29:12.408
It's gonna bite you!

29:14.036 --> 29:15.745
- Dad, it's gonna bite you.
- What are you doing?

29:15.747 --> 29:19.082
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

29:19.084 --> 29:21.542
Be careful. Stop,
it's gonna aggravate it.

29:21.544 --> 29:23.294
Oh, my God!

29:23.296 --> 29:25.338
- Robert!
- Dad, stop!

29:25.340 --> 29:27.465
- Go away!
- Robert!

29:27.467 --> 29:30.178
Fuck...

29:34.598 --> 29:36.558
Fuck you, snake!

29:37.643 --> 29:40.854
- Is it gone?
- I'll fucking eat your whole fucking family.

30:10.509 --> 30:11.510
Yeah!

30:20.937 --> 30:22.272
Wait a minute...

30:32.030 --> 30:33.450
Should we have eaten it?

30:35.410 --> 30:40.830
- Gross. No.
- Snakes with extra cheese! Cheese with extra snakes!

30:40.832 --> 30:42.917
I don't know how to eat
a snake, do you?

30:43.959 --> 30:47.044
Yeah, you just pick it up

30:47.046 --> 30:49.090
and bite the head off,
like Ozzy.

30:50.299 --> 30:51.383
Wasn't that a bat?

30:53.761 --> 30:56.638
Snakes are just bats
that can't fly.

30:57.891 --> 30:59.601
What the fuck?

31:19.245 --> 31:20.537
Tell me again.

31:23.499 --> 31:25.666
Tell you what, baby?

31:25.668 --> 31:28.671
You know what. Please?

31:30.882 --> 31:34.719
Okay. Where do you want me
to start?

31:36.679 --> 31:39.554
Tell me about how big and fat
you were, Mom.

31:39.556 --> 31:42.684
Hey.

31:44.103 --> 31:47.479
It looked like I was smuggling

31:47.481 --> 31:53.361
a big, gigantic watermelon
underneath my shirt,

31:53.363 --> 31:58.157
but all that was under there
was you.

31:58.159 --> 32:03.498
I was saying, "Patience, baby.
I need you to have patience."

32:04.498 --> 32:07.291
Because you weren't
at the hospital yet.

32:07.293 --> 32:08.670
You were at a Walmart.

32:10.337 --> 32:11.338
That's right.

32:12.966 --> 32:16.676
You and Sissy.
But Sissy was my age.

32:16.678 --> 32:19.469
No, Sissy was
a little bit younger, but yes,

32:19.471 --> 32:23.142
Sissy was... was there with us.

32:24.853 --> 32:26.395
What were you buying?

32:27.354 --> 32:30.898
A pizza, because?

32:30.900 --> 32:33.066
You were tired of cooking
all the time.

32:33.068 --> 32:35.319
Oh. Yes, that's right.

32:35.321 --> 32:38.908
I was nine months pregnant,
and I was exhausted.

32:44.831 --> 32:45.832
Where was Dad?

32:49.710 --> 32:51.296
I don't remember.

32:52.130 --> 32:54.674
Dad, where were you
when I was born?

32:57.343 --> 32:59.092
He was drunk at a bowling alley.

32:59.094 --> 33:00.764
No, don't.

33:11.607 --> 33:14.065
Mommy, I'm tired.

33:14.067 --> 33:17.446
Just close your eyes baby.

33:18.323 --> 33:22.074
I'm tired, Mommy, I'm tired.

33:33.462 --> 33:38.218
Yeah... I'm tired too.

34:04.369 --> 34:06.871
- What is it?
- Shh...

34:28.308 --> 34:30.976
- I think it's a dog.
- A dog?

34:30.978 --> 34:32.228
- Wait.
- Oh, my God.

34:32.230 --> 34:33.353
- Bobby!
- Bobby! God damn it!

34:33.355 --> 34:34.357
No, don't!

34:37.860 --> 34:39.529
He's licking my hand, you guys.

34:40.737 --> 34:43.029
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

34:43.031 --> 34:45.074
You are, you are.

34:45.076 --> 34:47.909
Wait, is that actually a dog?

34:47.911 --> 34:48.955
Yeah, check.

34:53.710 --> 34:57.335
Oh, my God.
It's... it's actually a dog.

34:57.337 --> 34:59.004
- Is it?
- All right, well, be careful.

34:59.006 --> 35:01.632
You don't know what kind
of shit that thing has.

35:01.634 --> 35:04.761
Do you think it's Spot?
I think it's Spot.

35:04.763 --> 35:07.888
Spot, is that you boy?
It is, isn't it?

35:07.890 --> 35:11.600
Everybody said you're buried in the
backyard. But that isn't true, right?

35:11.602 --> 35:14.270
You just ran away and now
you've come to save us.

35:14.272 --> 35:16.815
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

35:17.859 --> 35:19.400
I'm a good boy!

35:22.906 --> 35:25.323
Oh, my God! Help! Help!

35:25.325 --> 35:28.828
Oh, my God! Help!
Oh, my God! Help!

35:29.286 --> 35:32.788
Help! Oh, my God!

35:32.790 --> 35:34.540
Why did it talk?
Why did it talk?

35:34.542 --> 35:36.917
Let my daughter go,
I'll fucking kill you!

35:36.919 --> 35:41.254
Oh, my God, help me!

35:41.256 --> 35:44.341
I'll kill you!

35:44.343 --> 35:47.636
Mel!

35:47.638 --> 35:52.683
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

36:05.073 --> 36:06.783
What the fuck?

36:35.102 --> 36:36.103
Holy shit.

37:13.140 --> 37:15.768
He comes back, I'll break his
goddamn skull.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.190
Don't most things die with
their tongues ripped out?

37:23.151 --> 37:25.402
What do I look like?
Some kind of fucking doctor?

37:28.071 --> 37:29.990
Well, we at least need to try,
right?

37:30.908 --> 37:31.910
Try what?

37:32.660 --> 37:33.620
We haven't eaten.

37:38.625 --> 37:40.251
Mel, you're one sick fuck.

37:44.004 --> 37:45.504
Here.

37:45.506 --> 37:47.966
Mom, do I have to eat
the tongue, too?

37:50.094 --> 37:52.346
Yes, baby.

37:53.388 --> 37:56.473
Okay, we have to eat this
in tiny bites

37:56.475 --> 38:00.685
because it'll be tough to chew
but easy to choke on,

38:00.687 --> 38:01.939
so we have to be careful.

38:02.815 --> 38:04.899
One more day in here
I'd probably take a chomp

38:04.901 --> 38:07.025
out of that creep's dick.

38:07.027 --> 38:08.527
That's disgusting.

38:08.529 --> 38:11.321
Yeah, dicks are for peeing,
not eating, Dad.

38:20.207 --> 38:21.540
Well, I'll try it first.

38:21.542 --> 38:23.585
I'm the one who caught it,
right?

38:34.388 --> 38:37.015
Ah!

38:38.017 --> 38:39.766
Oh, are you okay?

38:46.609 --> 38:48.942
- Give me another.
- You sure?

38:48.944 --> 38:51.321
Yeah, all of you.
We need to eat.

40:01.725 --> 40:04.728
How did everything get
so fucked up?

40:08.440 --> 40:11.317
You know what happened.

40:11.319 --> 40:13.822
You know exactly what happened.

40:17.116 --> 40:18.118
True.

40:20.995 --> 40:21.996
Joe.

40:34.591 --> 40:35.634
What are you doing?

40:37.094 --> 40:40.013
My God, get the fuck
out of here!

40:40.973 --> 40:42.267
Go, you fucking creep.

40:48.105 --> 40:50.105
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

40:50.107 --> 40:51.399
He follows me everywhere.

40:51.401 --> 40:52.986
Yeah, what a fucking dunce.

41:03.413 --> 41:05.996
Why couldn't he just
take a fucking hint?

41:09.794 --> 41:12.379
In retrospect, we shouldn't be
surprised at what he did.

41:14.631 --> 41:15.632
No.

41:26.935 --> 41:28.812
You don't have to say anything.

41:31.565 --> 41:33.901
Anything you think, I think.

41:36.738 --> 41:37.739
How?

41:42.201 --> 41:46.161
I don't understand
what's happening.

41:46.163 --> 41:47.998
No one's asking you to.

41:52.712 --> 41:57.801
We had to do something to stop
from talking shit, right?

41:58.218 --> 41:59.219
We had to.

42:24.618 --> 42:25.620
Give me a hand?

42:31.292 --> 42:32.794
Sorry, Spot.

42:39.801 --> 42:40.802
Ugh.

42:53.480 --> 42:55.105
The spell should be pretty
simple.

42:55.107 --> 42:56.732
The mob does it all the time.

42:56.734 --> 42:57.694
The mob?

42:58.486 --> 43:00.319
It convinces people to stop
talking shit about you.

43:00.321 --> 43:02.071
Gives them a stern warning that
you aren't someone

43:02.073 --> 43:03.199
to be fucked with.

43:04.158 --> 43:07.828
So, let's give this motherfucker
a warning, shall we?

43:21.801 --> 43:24.053
Back to you in a second.

43:35.689 --> 43:37.858
I think his full name is Joseph.

43:38.859 --> 43:40.611
I'm not sure it matters
that much.

44:01.091 --> 44:03.093
Sorry, it's just my mom.

44:37.627 --> 44:41.089
This way, anything he tries to say
about me will be turned against him.

45:05.696 --> 45:07.529
- I love you...
- Shh.

45:14.122 --> 45:15.123
I love you too.

45:20.335 --> 45:22.254
This is how we really make him
suffer.

46:21.980 --> 46:22.982
Get up.

46:29.781 --> 46:32.906
What? Dad?

46:32.908 --> 46:35.661
- Get up.
- Why?

46:40.417 --> 46:42.542
- Dad, why?
- When I tell you to do something,

46:42.544 --> 46:44.212
do you you do it
or you question me?

46:45.672 --> 46:47.797
I do it.

46:47.799 --> 46:48.882
Then do it.

46:53.721 --> 46:55.888
What are you looking at her for?
I'm the one talking to you.

46:55.890 --> 46:57.100
What's going on?

46:57.975 --> 46:59.852
Bobby and I are gonna try
something.

47:03.647 --> 47:04.731
Try what?

47:06.942 --> 47:08.902
- You see that?
- See what?

47:11.071 --> 47:13.531
The goddamn opening.
Do you see it?

47:13.533 --> 47:14.906
Yes.

47:14.908 --> 47:17.745
Good. I need you
to go through it.

47:18.747 --> 47:19.748
What?

47:21.290 --> 47:22.417
I, I can't.

47:24.544 --> 47:25.962
You're not even gonna try?

47:28.339 --> 47:30.255
You didn't even try.

47:30.257 --> 47:32.134
What is it gonna hurt
if you just try?

47:33.261 --> 47:34.801
Why do you keep looking at her?

47:34.803 --> 47:36.596
I don't know!

47:36.598 --> 47:38.056
I'm your daddy, right?

47:39.142 --> 47:40.143
Yes.

47:42.060 --> 47:45.062
And you want to make your
mommy and daddy happy, right?

47:45.064 --> 47:46.313
Yes.

47:48.192 --> 47:50.361
Then you need to help us
get out of here.

47:51.654 --> 47:57.243
You need to climb through
there, squeeze through, please.

47:58.870 --> 48:01.330
- Do not do...
- Shut up!

48:05.210 --> 48:07.837
Come on, Bobby. You can do it.
I believe in you. Do it.

48:24.562 --> 48:26.397
You're not even trying!

48:28.732 --> 48:31.192
- But...
- Come on, you can fucking do it.

48:31.194 --> 48:32.734
Stop being a fucking baby
about it,

48:32.736 --> 48:34.487
just squeeze through there.

48:38.410 --> 48:40.203
Come on, God damn it. Squeeze!

48:43.997 --> 48:44.957
Come on.

48:45.750 --> 48:47.667
- God damn it.
- Dad!

48:47.669 --> 48:50.795
You're almost there. Just do it.

48:50.797 --> 48:52.173
Go through.

48:55.634 --> 48:57.761
God damn it,
squeeze through there!

48:58.971 --> 49:01.556
- Dad! Stop!
- God damn it!

49:01.558 --> 49:03.266
What the fuck?
He's not gonna fit!

49:03.268 --> 49:05.270
Squeeze through!

49:05.937 --> 49:08.520
Get the fuck off of him!
Who are you?!

49:08.522 --> 49:11.232
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What the fuck are you doing?

49:11.234 --> 49:13.734
- That's our son.
- I have a plan. I'm trying to get us out of here!

49:13.736 --> 49:18.406
- You're putting our son in the...
- What are we gonna die out here!

49:18.408 --> 49:21.451
Now he's on the fucking ground.
Come over here!

49:21.453 --> 49:23.828
Bobby? Oh, my God.

49:23.830 --> 49:27.080
Bobby? Bobby! Bobby, it's okay!

49:27.082 --> 49:29.000
Come on, come on.
Let's get in the tub.

49:29.002 --> 49:30.960
Let's get in the tub. It's okay.

49:30.962 --> 49:32.754
It's okay, come on.
Let's get in the tub. Guys! Guys!

49:32.756 --> 49:34.672
In the tub, in the tub! Get in the tub.

49:34.674 --> 49:36.507
- Guys! Fuck!
- ...ain't doing nothing!

49:36.509 --> 49:38.717
Guys, will you fucking stop?
Something happened to Bobby.

49:38.719 --> 49:41.929
I think... oh, my God, I think it was the snake.

49:47.853 --> 49:49.562
Jesus Christ.

50:07.207 --> 50:09.748
- Get the toilet lid.
- What?

50:09.750 --> 50:11.417
The top of the fucking toilet,
get it!

50:16.632 --> 50:17.964
Okay, ready?

50:22.055 --> 50:23.431
Oh, God, did it get you?

50:24.140 --> 50:26.223
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, my gosh.

50:26.225 --> 50:30.060
- Here, let me see. Bobby.
- Let me see.

50:30.062 --> 50:32.605
Stop it. Oh, gosh.

50:32.607 --> 50:35.857
- Okay. Can you get me your tie?
- What, why?

50:35.859 --> 50:39.694
- For a tourniquet.
- No, we need to suck the venom out of him.

50:39.696 --> 50:42.573
No, I think we need to make sure
the venom doesn't go to his heart.

50:42.575 --> 50:43.868
Give me your goddamn tie.

50:45.120 --> 50:48.955
Okay, okay, one second, one second.

50:48.957 --> 50:51.167
Okay. Wait.

50:51.960 --> 50:53.500
- No. No.
- Bobby!

50:53.502 --> 50:54.710
Oh, my gosh. Can you hold him?

50:54.712 --> 50:57.340
I can't do this.

51:03.513 --> 51:04.514
All right.

51:10.477 --> 51:12.812
Did you get it?

51:12.814 --> 51:14.272
Did you get it? Did you get it?

51:14.274 --> 51:16.190
Did you get it?

51:16.192 --> 51:17.902
I... I don't know, maybe.

51:21.823 --> 51:24.325
You're safe in here.
Baby? Baby, listen to me.

51:25.243 --> 51:28.745
- We need water.
- Okay, I'll get you water in a minute. Just hold on.

51:28.747 --> 51:30.165
Motherfucker.

51:31.040 --> 51:34.294
- I know, just relax, try to relax.
- Motherfucker.

51:35.044 --> 51:39.504
Motherfucker.
Fucker. Motherfucker.

51:39.506 --> 51:41.467
You fucking motherfucker.

51:42.426 --> 51:46.053
Is Bobby gonna be okay?
Mom, is Bobby gonna be okay?

51:46.055 --> 51:48.975
Yes, he's gonna be fine!
Right, Bobby?

51:50.185 --> 51:55.105
- Gonna be fine.
- Motherfucker. You fucking motherfucker!

51:55.607 --> 52:00.320
You motherfucker. You motherfucking motherfucker!

52:01.613 --> 52:05.200
You fucker! You motherfucking
motherfucker!

52:06.116 --> 52:11.038
You fuckers!

52:11.915 --> 52:13.955
You motherfuckers!

52:13.957 --> 52:17.542
You motherfuckers!
Let me the fuck out of here!

52:17.544 --> 52:19.377
I'll fucking kill you!

52:19.379 --> 52:24.343
Open the fucking door!
God damn it!

52:25.636 --> 52:31.100
Oh, God, oh, God!

52:54.582 --> 52:57.333
Bobby? Bobby, I'm so sorry.

52:57.335 --> 52:58.336
Bobby, I...

52:59.462 --> 53:01.962
I'm so sorry,
this is all my fault.

53:01.964 --> 53:04.005
What? What are you talking about?
This is not your fault.

53:04.007 --> 53:07.509
- This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no. Shh.

53:07.511 --> 53:11.806
It's gonna be okay. Okay? You're gonna be okay.

53:11.808 --> 53:16.143
Honey. It's nobody's fault.
It's nobody's fault.

53:16.145 --> 53:17.147
Okay?

53:19.232 --> 53:22.235
Hello? Hello?

53:24.446 --> 53:28.283
What's going on? Are you okay?

53:29.533 --> 53:34.372
Hey, who's there?

53:37.082 --> 53:38.292
We're over here.

53:41.254 --> 53:42.255
We need help.

53:43.631 --> 53:44.924
My son was bit.

53:47.761 --> 53:50.136
My son was bit. Help!

53:50.138 --> 53:53.054
- Do you see someone?
- I don't see shit.

53:53.056 --> 53:54.058
Hello?

53:55.643 --> 54:00.480
Please, we need a fucking
doctor.

54:00.482 --> 54:02.355
All right, follow my voice.

54:02.357 --> 54:05.484
Oh, Jesus Christ.

54:05.486 --> 54:07.152
We can't.

54:07.154 --> 54:11.033
We're stuck.
You follow my voice.

54:13.911 --> 54:17.957
Please. We... My son needs
medical attention.

54:19.042 --> 54:20.835
Okay, okay, hold on.

54:22.462 --> 54:24.631
I think I see you. Hold on.

54:25.881 --> 54:28.216
Hold on, I have to...
No...

54:28.218 --> 54:30.051
What's that... what?

54:30.053 --> 54:31.928
Oh, God...

54:31.930 --> 54:34.304
Oh, God! No!

55:12.971 --> 55:14.806
Do you see anything?

55:21.062 --> 55:23.230
No, I don't see anything.

55:27.359 --> 55:31.573
But I think we should keep the
door closed for a little while.

55:38.370 --> 55:40.538
But what about Bobby?

55:40.540 --> 55:43.668
Shut the fuck up!

55:50.591 --> 55:53.051
- I think we should ta...
- Shut the fuck up, all of you!

57:06.417 --> 57:10.379
Okay, I think we can talk again.

57:11.714 --> 57:14.676
But we should still watch
our volumes, just in case.

57:16.468 --> 57:17.469
In case of what?

57:27.020 --> 57:28.480
What did you see out there?

57:35.321 --> 57:36.322
I don't know.

57:40.410 --> 57:42.245
Did someone really shoot
that guy?

57:44.330 --> 57:46.290
Maybe he was shooting something.

57:50.837 --> 57:51.838
Something?

57:52.964 --> 57:54.215
I don't know.

57:59.261 --> 58:00.596
Bobby needs help.

58:03.140 --> 58:04.183
We all need help.

58:05.185 --> 58:07.350
He needs a doctor, Robert.

58:07.352 --> 58:08.896
You think I don't know that?

58:13.442 --> 58:14.736
Can that bite kill him?

58:17.363 --> 58:21.618
I think I sucked everything out.
I don't... I don't know.

58:25.705 --> 58:28.500
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck happened?

58:33.171 --> 58:34.422
I'm scared.

58:37.926 --> 58:38.968
Me too, sweetheart.

58:46.350 --> 58:49.269
What should we do?

58:54.274 --> 58:58.445
Guys, what should we do?

58:59.404 --> 59:02.616
Mel, why the fuck do you keep
asking us what should we do?!

59:03.535 --> 59:05.618
We know exactly what you know.

59:05.620 --> 59:09.496
Which is fucking nothing, okay?
Okay?

59:09.498 --> 59:10.500
Yeah.

59:16.506 --> 59:18.049
Okay, I'm sorry.

59:24.138 --> 59:25.765
I don't know what we're
gonna do.

59:27.225 --> 59:29.100
I don't know what happened
out there.

59:29.102 --> 59:31.895
I don't know who shot who.
I don't know why they shot him.

59:32.939 --> 59:36.607
I don't know if we're ever gonna get
out of this bathroom to find out.

59:36.609 --> 59:38.486
I don't even know if I wanna
find out.

59:41.364 --> 59:43.533
I don't know if Bobby's gonna
be okay.

59:46.995 --> 59:50.498
I don't know goddamn much
about anything right now.

01:00:17.192 --> 01:00:18.732
We killed him.

01:00:18.734 --> 01:00:20.650
I know. We fucked up.

01:00:20.652 --> 01:00:21.654
We?

01:00:22.614 --> 01:00:26.868
We're in this together,
aren't we?

01:00:29.703 --> 01:00:31.247
Yeah, we're in this together.

01:00:33.332 --> 01:00:34.832
Thank you for not abandoning me.

01:00:34.834 --> 01:00:38.129
Hey, I would never, okay?

01:00:43.384 --> 01:00:44.761
It was a necromancy spell.

01:00:45.761 --> 01:00:50.933
- That we used on Joe?
- No, Melly, not Joe. Me, I used it on myself.

01:00:52.185 --> 01:00:55.939
I told you I was dead,
or at least I thought I was dead.

01:00:57.482 --> 01:00:58.483
How?

01:00:59.817 --> 01:01:01.859
It's complicated, and getting
into the details now,

01:01:01.861 --> 01:01:03.527
it's not important.
Right?

01:01:03.529 --> 01:01:05.112
The point is this,
that specific kind of spell

01:01:05.114 --> 01:01:06.906
is supposed to bring back
people from the dead.

01:01:06.908 --> 01:01:08.866
And something inside of me
was dead.

01:01:08.868 --> 01:01:10.451
So it only makes sense
theoretically

01:01:10.453 --> 01:01:13.413
that it could... would work.

01:01:13.415 --> 01:01:14.416
Did it?

01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:19.377
I, I thought I was better,
that I was healed.

01:01:19.379 --> 01:01:21.045
Well, are you?

01:01:21.047 --> 01:01:24.005
I haven't felt right
in the past couple of days.

01:01:24.007 --> 01:01:26.801
And I thought maybe it was all the
deepfake porno bullshit Joe pulled on me.

01:01:26.803 --> 01:01:28.680
But now I suspect
it's something else.

01:01:29.513 --> 01:01:31.140
Something a little more evil.

01:01:32.225 --> 01:01:33.891
Amy, you're not making
any sense.

01:01:33.893 --> 01:01:36.810
What if it wasn't me
who was dead all this time?

01:01:36.812 --> 01:01:40.063
What if something was inside me
and that's what was dead?

01:01:40.065 --> 01:01:43.859
And when I performed the spell,
it woke up?

01:01:43.861 --> 01:01:47.196
- Amy, I...
- It's just been waiting for the perfect moment

01:01:47.198 --> 01:01:48.450
to announce its arrival.

01:01:52.453 --> 01:01:56.413
- I don't think...
- It has to be why the tongue spell went so wrong.

01:01:56.415 --> 01:01:58.583
I mean, I know we substituted
a dog's tongue for a cow's,

01:01:58.585 --> 01:02:01.835
but still, I mean, holy shit,
what happened shouldn't have happened.

01:02:01.837 --> 01:02:06.214
Unless the person who conducted the ritual
had something hiding inside of them.

01:02:06.216 --> 01:02:10.051
Something beyond human.
Something...

01:02:10.053 --> 01:02:11.221
Something what?

01:02:13.515 --> 01:02:14.683
Something diabolical.

01:02:38.082 --> 01:02:39.834
Why hasn't he checked
on you yet?

01:02:52.721 --> 01:02:56.891
- Why hasn't who...
- Dee. Don't play deaf.

01:02:56.893 --> 01:03:01.606
I know you hear me.
Don't you think he's worried?

01:03:05.234 --> 01:03:08.028
I really don't think now is the
best time to talk about this.

01:03:11.616 --> 01:03:14.786
I'm not trying to be
an asshole, God damn it.

01:03:16.913 --> 01:03:21.373
I'm just saying
we need to get out of here

01:03:21.375 --> 01:03:23.292
or we're fucked.

01:03:23.294 --> 01:03:24.504
Especially now.

01:03:25.672 --> 01:03:27.507
Who are you guys talking about?

01:03:30.384 --> 01:03:32.594
It's okay, baby. It's okay.
I know.

01:03:33.805 --> 01:03:34.806
Well?

01:03:39.935 --> 01:03:41.478
I told him if he didn't...

01:03:43.272 --> 01:03:44.897
...he didn't hear from me
by midnight,

01:03:44.899 --> 01:03:48.152
then something might have
happened.

01:03:53.491 --> 01:03:54.576
Something like what?

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:03.123
We really shouldn't
get into this.

01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:05.252
Oh, I'm sorry,
is this a bad time?

01:04:10.132 --> 01:04:13.594
I didn't know how you'd react.
I was scared.

01:04:15.053 --> 01:04:16.055
Scared of what?

01:04:19.975 --> 01:04:21.558
Of you.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.439
What'd you think I'd do?
Hurt you?

01:04:28.567 --> 01:04:32.737
- Maybe.
- Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. Have I ever hurt you?

01:04:32.739 --> 01:04:34.199
Stop ignoring me.

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:38.283
What the fuck are you guys
talking about?

01:04:38.285 --> 01:04:41.788
I gave you chances,
plenty of chances.

01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:44.540
I gave you years and years
of chances.

01:04:44.542 --> 01:04:47.542
Years? You wanna talk
about years?

01:04:47.544 --> 01:04:49.920
I'll talk to you
about fucking years.

01:04:49.922 --> 01:04:52.130
Talk about years
all fucking day long.

01:04:52.132 --> 01:04:54.716
You think you're ever getting
out of here?

01:04:54.718 --> 01:04:56.551
You think any of us is ever
gonna walk

01:04:56.553 --> 01:04:58.804
- out of this door again?
- That's enough!

01:04:58.806 --> 01:04:59.808
You're the most...!

01:05:01.225 --> 01:05:05.185
You're the most delusional bitch
I've ever met in my entire life!

01:05:05.187 --> 01:05:07.522
- Mom...
- Please stop fighting. Please stop fighting.

01:05:07.524 --> 01:05:09.776
You're scaring the kids again,
dear.

01:05:12.236 --> 01:05:16.239
Mommy.

01:05:16.241 --> 01:05:18.366
It hurts, everything burns.

01:05:18.368 --> 01:05:20.036
Everything burns.

01:05:23.163 --> 01:05:24.165
His heartbeat...

01:05:25.917 --> 01:05:27.708
Bobby, you gotta
calm the fuck down.

01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:30.252
You gotta calm the fuck down
right now.

01:05:30.254 --> 01:05:32.672
- Okay, that isn't helping.
- What the fuck do you want me to do?

01:05:32.674 --> 01:05:34.297
I don't know. Just not that.

01:05:39.596 --> 01:05:41.931
Okay, baby.
Okay, baby, it's okay.

01:05:43.475 --> 01:05:47.937
I want you to take nice,
deep breaths, okay?

01:05:47.939 --> 01:05:50.897
Okay, do it with me.

01:05:50.899 --> 01:05:52.526
Deep breath.

01:05:55.321 --> 01:05:58.448
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:01.324
That's good. That's good.

01:06:01.326 --> 01:06:04.120
That's good. That's good.

01:06:04.122 --> 01:06:08.040
Mom, tell me again.

01:06:11.337 --> 01:06:13.214
Tell you what, baby?

01:06:14.131 --> 01:06:17.926
You know, please.

01:06:19.094 --> 01:06:21.430
We were trying to buy
a frozen pizza,

01:06:23.056 --> 01:06:26.308
and you decided you had been
in my belly long enough.

01:06:27.687 --> 01:06:31.188
Your big, fat belly.

01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:35.484
Like a watermelon.

01:06:37.404 --> 01:06:38.489
And I...

01:06:43.203 --> 01:06:45.786
I couldn't walk anymore
and I was just...

01:06:50.292 --> 01:06:53.671
It hurt so badly and you were
kicking me so hard.

01:06:57.299 --> 01:07:01.678
Did they call an ambulance?

01:07:02.513 --> 01:07:03.515
They sure did.

01:07:05.933 --> 01:07:08.018
And while we were waiting
for the ambulance,

01:07:09.728 --> 01:07:16.276
Sissy sat down
next to me and held my hand.

01:07:19.739 --> 01:07:22.198
And she looked at me
and she said,

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.368
"Everything's gonna be okay.

01:07:27.205 --> 01:07:30.667
You just have to be brave
and wait little bit longer.

01:07:33.252 --> 01:07:38.091
Nothing bad is gonna happen.
And everything will work out."

01:07:41.051 --> 01:07:45.140
And you know what,
baby? She was right.

01:07:47.725 --> 01:07:51.103
She helped me be brave
and strong.

01:07:52.522 --> 01:07:55.188
And we waited for the ambulance
to come.

01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:58.109
And when they came,
they pulled you out of me.

01:07:58.111 --> 01:08:01.112
Right there, on the frozen food
section floor.

01:08:05.076 --> 01:08:08.830
And that's why I know you're
gonna be okay.

01:08:10.873 --> 01:08:12.915
And Sissy's gonna be okay.

01:08:12.917 --> 01:08:17.169
And everything's gonna be okay
and someone's gonna come.

01:08:17.171 --> 01:08:21.131
Someone's gonna come and move
that tree and open that door.

01:08:21.134 --> 01:08:24.551
And everyone will be waiting
outside.

01:08:24.554 --> 01:08:25.930
And life will be better.

01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:30.015
And everything will be okay.

01:08:30.018 --> 01:08:32.727
You just have to hold on
a little bit longer, okay, baby?

01:08:32.729 --> 01:08:37.397
Just have to hold on
a little bit longer. Okay?

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:38.817
Just trust...

01:09:16.022 --> 01:09:17.649
I'm so sorry.

01:09:23.237 --> 01:09:28.200
No! Baby!

01:09:28.451 --> 01:09:30.745
My baby boy, come on!

01:09:31.996 --> 01:09:36.000
No, we just have to wait
a little longer! Please.

01:10:36.227 --> 01:10:37.644
Where did you get this?

01:10:39.563 --> 01:10:41.732
Some secrets aren't meant to be
revealed.

01:11:04.171 --> 01:11:07.466
Now me.

01:11:08.468 --> 01:11:09.469
Make me bleed.

01:11:24.024 --> 01:11:25.859
You can't fix the inevitable.

01:11:54.889 --> 01:11:56.015
Fuck.

01:12:29.131 --> 01:12:30.841
God, why won't it stop?

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:35.972
Wait, where's, where's Bobby?

01:12:41.935 --> 01:12:43.188
Where he's always been, baby.

01:12:52.529 --> 01:12:54.698
Mom, my stomach hurts.

01:12:59.203 --> 01:13:01.038
Why weren't you answering
my calls?

01:13:03.207 --> 01:13:08.045
I... I don't feel good. I think...
I think there's something inside me.

01:13:09.714 --> 01:13:11.131
We're all gonna die
because of you.

01:13:12.884 --> 01:13:16.552
- What?
- You didn't know your own daughter was a witch?

01:13:16.554 --> 01:13:18.348
Some fucking mother you are.

01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:22.933
- Is that true, Mel?
- Please, help me.

01:13:22.935 --> 01:13:24.938
Don't. It's a trap.

01:13:25.979 --> 01:13:27.771
One of her witch traps.

01:13:27.773 --> 01:13:30.816
You try to help her and she'll
curse you.

01:13:30.818 --> 01:13:32.903
No, something is wrong.

01:13:38.952 --> 01:13:41.204
Just give me a second, will you?

01:14:01.306 --> 01:14:02.392
Where am I?

01:14:05.854 --> 01:14:07.063
Where do you think?

01:14:10.399 --> 01:14:11.567
Oh, God.

01:14:20.827 --> 01:14:22.660
Jesus Christ.

01:14:22.662 --> 01:14:24.330
Fuck, what's wrong with me?

01:14:27.834 --> 01:14:33.005
After what happened, you...
you drank this, all of it.

01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:41.389
And you couldn't even
leave any for me, could you?

01:14:44.184 --> 01:14:46.019
After... After what happened?

01:16:41.925 --> 01:16:43.343
This is all my fault.

01:16:49.309 --> 01:16:50.432
What?

01:16:50.434 --> 01:16:52.269
All of this is because of me.

01:16:53.563 --> 01:16:57.192
- No, it's not...
- No, no, just listen. You're not listening.

01:17:00.319 --> 01:17:02.404
Last night...
Fuck, not last night.

01:17:03.697 --> 01:17:05.200
The night all of this started,

01:17:07.577 --> 01:17:08.578
Amy and I...

01:17:11.038 --> 01:17:12.540
We did something bad.

01:17:15.085 --> 01:17:16.834
I don't understand.

01:17:16.836 --> 01:17:20.757
Amy was sick, okay?
Like, really, truly sick. We...

01:17:21.715 --> 01:17:24.383
We thought that there was
something inside her.

01:17:24.385 --> 01:17:27.972
Maybe something...
something bad, like a...

01:17:28.848 --> 01:17:31.641
Like a demon or spirit.

01:17:31.643 --> 01:17:36.103
Mel, what the fuck
are you babbling about?

01:17:36.105 --> 01:17:37.689
A boy at school died.

01:17:40.484 --> 01:17:41.819
It was because of us.

01:17:44.029 --> 01:17:46.446
We did a spell,

01:17:46.448 --> 01:17:49.241
something to just make him stop
spreading rumors,

01:17:49.243 --> 01:17:50.495
making up lies.

01:17:52.831 --> 01:17:54.457
He was never supposed to die.

01:17:55.707 --> 01:17:58.584
But something went wrong.

01:17:58.586 --> 01:18:02.088
That night, he choked on his
tongue while he was sleeping.

01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:04.798
It's impossible to choke
on your own tongue.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.303
Well, it happened.

01:18:09.179 --> 01:18:10.762
And who knows what would have
kept happening

01:18:10.764 --> 01:18:12.267
if we hadn't put a stop to it.

01:18:16.604 --> 01:18:17.605
What do you mean?

01:18:18.814 --> 01:18:22.109
- Put an end to...
- An end to the thing possessing Amy.

01:18:24.778 --> 01:18:25.779
A demon?

01:18:28.450 --> 01:18:30.324
Well, we, we didn't know
what it was.

01:18:30.326 --> 01:18:32.953
Just that it was bad.

01:18:34.581 --> 01:18:37.333
- What did you do?
- We tried to kill it.

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:41.921
We did a spell,
something we found online.

01:18:44.424 --> 01:18:45.425
Online?

01:18:49.261 --> 01:18:50.721
I think...

01:18:54.642 --> 01:18:57.479
I think that everything
that's been happening

01:18:58.645 --> 01:19:00.398
is because of a spell we did.

01:19:01.608 --> 01:19:03.777
I think we messed up really bad.

01:19:12.827 --> 01:19:16.623
If that's true,
what you just said,

01:19:18.416 --> 01:19:20.168
why didn't you say anything
before?

01:19:22.252 --> 01:19:25.670
- I was afraid.
- Ah, brave enough to destroy the world

01:19:25.672 --> 01:19:28.173
but too chicken shit
to own up to it, is that it?

01:19:28.175 --> 01:19:29.176
What?

01:19:30.970 --> 01:19:32.388
I want you to look in that tub.

01:19:34.349 --> 01:19:36.726
I want you to look
at your dead brother.

01:19:38.435 --> 01:19:40.061
Do you smell that?

01:19:40.063 --> 01:19:41.272
That's his corpse.

01:19:42.523 --> 01:19:45.067
Decomposing, rotting.

01:19:46.443 --> 01:19:51.115
And all because of you and
your voodoo bitch girlfriend!

01:19:51.907 --> 01:19:56.076
I hope your fun little time on the
internet was worth murdering your family.

01:19:56.078 --> 01:19:59.871
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:19:59.873 --> 01:20:03.459
Speak that way to my daughter again
and I'll slit your fucking throat.

01:20:03.461 --> 01:20:05.713
I look forward
to the day.

01:20:12.303 --> 01:20:15.473
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:21:13.447 --> 01:21:15.200
We need to eat him.

01:21:22.206 --> 01:21:23.248
Leave him alone.

01:21:25.251 --> 01:21:26.836
It's our only choice.

01:21:28.670 --> 01:21:29.922
Like hell it is.

01:21:30.965 --> 01:21:32.050
We have to.

01:22:05.166 --> 01:22:06.251
What are you doing?

01:22:07.585 --> 01:22:09.754
I can't fucking see anything!

01:22:12.256 --> 01:22:14.882
I think I'm blind.
Jesus Christ.

01:22:14.884 --> 01:22:17.134
You have been sucking
alcohol wipes non-stop.

01:22:17.136 --> 01:22:20.137
- No wonder you're fucking blind.
- We need to find something to cut the flesh.

01:22:20.139 --> 01:22:22.056
Don't you fucking touch him!

01:22:22.058 --> 01:22:25.060
Stop acting hysterical!

01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:57.551
Now none of you fucking witches
better try and stop me.

01:23:00.263 --> 01:23:01.305
We gotta eat.

01:23:04.768 --> 01:23:06.895
Jesus Christ, what the fuck
is that?!

01:23:10.814 --> 01:23:14.357
What is that? What in the hell
is that?

01:23:39.844 --> 01:23:42.052
Oh, shit.

01:23:42.054 --> 01:23:44.723
I think I got it.

01:23:50.772 --> 01:23:51.773
Yes?

01:23:53.899 --> 01:23:54.901
Of course.

01:23:57.862 --> 01:23:59.486
Yes.

01:24:00.823 --> 01:24:01.825
No.

01:24:07.788 --> 01:24:12.834
I understand.

01:24:12.836 --> 01:24:13.837
Yes.

01:24:20.844 --> 01:24:22.427
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:24:22.429 --> 01:24:24.180
What the fuck, Robert?

01:24:28.684 --> 01:24:31.103
It makes sense, doesn't it?

01:24:32.104 --> 01:24:34.523
She's the one who started it.

01:24:35.567 --> 01:24:37.609
So she's the only one
who can end it.

01:24:38.862 --> 01:24:42.031
What? Was that Amy?

01:24:45.577 --> 01:24:47.118
End this nightmare, you witch.

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.203
Witch!

01:24:49.205 --> 01:24:52.123
Witch, witch!

01:24:52.125 --> 01:24:55.375
Kill the witch, kill the witch!

01:24:55.377 --> 01:24:57.003
Kill the witch!

01:24:57.005 --> 01:24:58.170
Get away! Leave her alone!

01:24:58.172 --> 01:25:01.257
Kill the witch. Kill the witch!

01:25:01.259 --> 01:25:04.927
- Kill the witch!
- Leave her alone! Leave her alone!

01:26:10.077 --> 01:26:11.953
Kill the witch!

01:26:11.955 --> 01:26:16.960
Kill the witch!

01:27:46.882 --> 01:27:49.135
Have we always been here?

01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:54.431
What?

01:28:01.063 --> 01:28:06.068
There's nothing
outside the door.

01:28:06.653 --> 01:28:09.614
There's nothing...

01:28:12.408 --> 01:28:13.410
Nothing.

01:28:16.621 --> 01:28:17.622
Nothing.

01:30:00.308 --> 01:30:01.309
Okay...

01:30:04.269 --> 01:30:05.354
Okay, okay...

01:30:07.232 --> 01:30:10.607
I'm gonna go out and see,
I'm just gonna...

01:30:10.609 --> 01:30:13.362
I'm just gonna see.
I'll be back.

01:31:22.431 --> 01:31:23.433
Mom?

01:31:25.225 --> 01:31:26.227
Mom?

01:31:28.438 --> 01:31:29.439
Mom?

01:31:32.317 --> 01:31:33.318
Mom?

01:31:35.487 --> 01:31:36.569
Mom?

01:31:47.916 --> 01:31:49.539
Amy!

01:31:49.541 --> 01:31:51.460
I used to cut myself.

01:32:14.567 --> 01:32:16.234
- Melissa!
- Mom?

01:32:19.363 --> 01:32:22.698
Mom...
I saw Amy.

01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:24.825
- I know. I know.
- I saw Amy.

01:32:24.827 --> 01:32:26.285
I know. I know.

01:32:26.287 --> 01:32:27.869
I know.

01:32:27.871 --> 01:32:30.124
Mom, what's outside?

01:32:30.666 --> 01:32:33.001
Mom, what's outside?

01:32:34.837 --> 01:32:38.213
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

01:32:38.215 --> 01:32:39.714
It's gonna be okay.

01:32:39.716 --> 01:32:41.342
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

01:32:41.344 --> 01:32:43.009
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna
be okay.

01:32:43.011 --> 01:32:45.096
It's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:32:45.098 --> 01:32:47.140
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:32:47.142 --> 01:32:49.142
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:32:49.144 --> 01:32:51.143
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:32:51.145 --> 01:32:53.396
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:32:53.398 --> 01:32:55.815
Everything's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:32:55.817 --> 01:32:58.276
Everything's gonna be okay.
