01:14.366 --> 01:17.160
On the way to a shutout.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.372
-No way, Jose.
-Yes way, Chico.

01:26.544 --> 01:29.005
Hey, what's all the racket about--

01:31.758 --> 01:36.971
How many times I gotta tell you two
this fence isn't made for handball?

01:37.055 --> 01:40.100
It's fra-guile, like my eardrums.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.185
One good smack,
and it could all come...

01:43.478 --> 01:44.688
Down.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.776
Uh, m-m-Max, I think it's time to...

01:49.859 --> 01:51.778
-Scram?
-Bingo.

01:52.821 --> 01:53.988
[groans]

01:55.031 --> 01:58.410
[Pete] Lousy way to spend a day...
[muttering]

01:58.493 --> 02:03.707
Could be wastin' quality time
in my dinghy trollin' for widemouth bass.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.959
[muttering]

02:06.042 --> 02:07.669
Petey, what are you doin'?

02:07.752 --> 02:11.381
Well, I am knittin' you a scarf!
What's it look like?

02:11.464 --> 02:14.676
I'm fixin' the damage that kid of yours
did to my fence.

02:15.093 --> 02:18.179
But my tomaters are all squished.

02:18.263 --> 02:22.308
So now you got the only ketchup plant
on the block.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.768
[laughing]

02:32.277 --> 02:33.111
[grunts]

02:33.194 --> 02:35.113
You musta moved the fence, Petey.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.366
It doesn't go there.
It goes... [strains] there.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.368
'Fraid not, Goof.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.495
It goes... [straining]

02:42.579 --> 02:43.663
There!

02:43.747 --> 02:46.791
Petey, I'm positive it goes... [straining]

02:46.875 --> 02:47.751
There.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.294
No, there.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.254
-There!
-There!

02:51.338 --> 02:52.964
-There!
-There!

02:53.048 --> 02:58.303
All right, Goof. Guess I gotta prove
to you where the property line is!

03:02.515 --> 03:04.100
Poor little fellers.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.770
Here it is, Goof--
official property profile,

03:06.853 --> 03:09.022
showing all
boundaries and borders.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.774
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.526
No need to bring your family
into this, Pete.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.196
I was right, wasn't I?

03:16.279 --> 03:21.201
Well, not exactly.
It's bad news, Goof.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.577
What is it, Petey?

03:22.660 --> 03:27.624
Oh, according to this, I own everything
right up to here.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.376
Lemme see that, Pete.

03:31.169 --> 03:35.215
I could do plenty with my beefed-up
boundaries, too.

03:38.843 --> 03:42.347
Like build me a nine-hole golf course.

03:42.430 --> 03:43.723
[crash]

03:43.807 --> 03:47.894
I feel awful about this, Goof.
Or put in a fully stocked trout pond!

03:47.977 --> 03:49.396
Really tough break for you.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.773
Or-- Or maybe raise buffalo.

03:51.856 --> 03:56.236
They make great poker buddies--
Always bring their own chips! Ha!

03:56.319 --> 04:00.573
But, hey, what am I talking about?

04:00.657 --> 04:03.410
I couldn't do that to a pal.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.995
You couldn't?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.164
Of course not.
You can keep your house.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.666
I won't even charge you rent.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.585
I can? You won't?

04:12.669 --> 04:15.922
Gawrsh, Pete, you're a prince.

04:16.006 --> 04:19.342
Uh, think of me more as a king

04:19.426 --> 04:23.596
and you're my grovelin' subject.

04:24.305 --> 04:28.059
Ah-hyuck! Pool's all clean,
your Peteyness.

04:28.143 --> 04:31.396
And ya turned up the temperature
so it's nice and toasty?

04:31.479 --> 04:33.815
Yup, just like you asked.

04:33.898 --> 04:38.486
Excellent, Goofer. You know, I believe
this arrangement's gonna work out.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.201
Huh?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.663
-Whoooaaah!
-[clang]

04:48.747 --> 04:52.083
Gawsh! I musta made it cold
instead of hot.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.378
Get me outta here!

04:58.256 --> 05:00.216
[straining]

05:02.302 --> 05:03.803
You idiot!

05:03.887 --> 05:05.889
Don't go anywhere, Petey.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.682
No!

05:07.766 --> 05:11.936
Pete, this is gonna hurt you
a lot more than me.

05:12.937 --> 05:16.191
Whaa-ooo-ho-ho!

05:18.276 --> 05:20.987
Whaa-ooo-ho-ho!

05:21.071 --> 05:22.280

05:22.364 --> 05:26.701
Whaa-ooo-ho-ho!

05:30.830 --> 05:34.918
Brrr! Wait'll I get my hands on that Goof!

05:35.001 --> 05:37.420
Look out below!

05:42.592 --> 05:44.678
He...he actually missed me.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.305
-Have you seen my sledgehammer, Petey?
-[descending whistle]

05:48.556 --> 05:49.766
[clang]

05:49.849 --> 05:50.892
[Pete sobbing]

05:50.975 --> 05:54.187
Oh, good. Ah-hyuck! You found it.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.481
No more messin' up, Goofster.

05:56.564 --> 06:00.318
I want that chimney swept so clean,
you can to eat off it!

06:00.402 --> 06:04.739
OK, Petey, but you oughta invest
in a nice set of dishes.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.741
Thanks, Goof.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.828
You oughta think about investing
in a nice set of brains.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.580
Hey, Petey, I found something!

06:12.664 --> 06:17.043
Anything up there belongs to me, see?
So toss it down!

06:17.127 --> 06:18.294
Okey-doke.

06:19.963 --> 06:20.880
What?

06:20.964 --> 06:23.299
Ahhhh! Yeeiaa!

06:23.383 --> 06:25.260
Bee-- Bees!

06:25.343 --> 06:27.303
Aah!

06:27.387 --> 06:29.014
Bees!

06:29.597 --> 06:31.182
What did ya say there, Petey?

06:32.267 --> 06:34.436
I can't hear you over all that buzzin'!

06:41.735 --> 06:45.655
Buzz off, ya stinkin' stingers.
I ain't no lunch meat!

06:52.495 --> 06:55.331
Get down here, ya goof!

06:55.415 --> 06:58.501
[Goofy] Okey-dokey! Whoooaaah!

06:58.585 --> 07:00.378
[coughing]

07:03.673 --> 07:06.634
You got what we call a soot problem,
Petey.

07:06.718 --> 07:10.847
No. I got a Goof problem.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.725
[Goofy] But don't you worry, Petey.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.727
I'm gonna have this place
cleaned up for you

07:15.810 --> 07:18.480
in two shakes of a pogo stick.
Ah-hyuck!

07:22.817 --> 07:24.652
Hey, whadya think you're--

07:26.237 --> 07:27.405
Gimme that!

07:28.531 --> 07:29.407
Oh.

07:29.491 --> 07:35.080
You know, Goofster, I could fire you
and take away half your house,

07:35.163 --> 07:37.165
but I'm not going to.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.416
'Cause I'm your bestest buddy?

07:38.500 --> 07:42.629
No. Because free help is harder to find
than good help.

07:43.421 --> 07:47.884
But from now on, you work outside, see,
where you can't do any damage!

07:49.803 --> 07:53.139
Now give that lawn a close
shave 'n' a haircut.

07:53.223 --> 07:56.726
And keep away from Peg's rosebushes!

07:56.810 --> 07:58.436
Will do, Petey.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.162
Hey, watch out for Peg's rosebushes!

08:16.246 --> 08:19.249
Whaa-ooo-ho-ho!

08:24.796 --> 08:26.381
Aah! What a--

08:26.464 --> 08:27.716
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

08:32.429 --> 08:34.597
Whaa-ooo-ho-ho!

08:35.932 --> 08:38.143
[clattering]

08:41.771 --> 08:44.357
Whoa-aah!

08:50.864 --> 08:53.867
No, no, no! Stay back! Stay back!

08:56.369 --> 08:59.205
Mower musta run out of gas. Ah-hyuck!

08:59.289 --> 09:02.375
That's it! You're through!

09:06.504 --> 09:09.049
You mean I don't have to
be your helper anymore, Petey?

09:09.132 --> 09:10.925
That's right.

09:13.428 --> 09:17.432
'Cause I'm taking possession
of my property!

09:17.515 --> 09:20.310
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

09:22.937 --> 09:24.981
[crash]

09:26.983 --> 09:30.779
Dad, you're not gonnas let Mr. Pete
get away with this, are you?

09:30.862 --> 09:33.531
We have to, Maxie.
It's his property now.

09:33.615 --> 09:37.786
But, Dad, it's a free country.
He can't steal our house!

09:37.869 --> 09:42.374
We got laws and a Bill of Rights!
That's what our forefathers fought for.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.586
Uh, Peg-ums. [nervous chuckle]

09:46.670 --> 09:48.797
Back from the mall so soon?

09:48.880 --> 09:49.714
[laughing]

09:49.798 --> 09:54.177
Petey, if you don't mind my asking,
what is going on here?

09:54.260 --> 09:56.179
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
can I ride on the big tractor

09:56.262 --> 09:58.390
and make it go up and down
and blow beep, beep, beep horn?

09:58.473 --> 10:00.934
Ha ha ha! Later, Pistol, honey.

10:01.017 --> 10:05.146
Uh, Peg-ums, I'm building me--
us-- a new wing.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.816
Discovered we own half
the Goof's property.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.484
Oh! Says who?

10:09.567 --> 10:11.277
This piece of paper.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.822
Why, I had it--

10:13.905 --> 10:15.573
Got it right here, Petey.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.870
[Pistol] Ha ha ha! Looky, Daddy.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.707
Mr. Goof made it fly like a kite.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.792
Pete, paper or no paper,

10:25.875 --> 10:28.503
you have no right to knock down
poor Goofy's house.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.506
Now hold on, Peg.
It's a free country.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.801
We got the Bill of Rights
and the right to post bills.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.887
That's what our forefathers fought for.
Ah-hyuck!

10:37.971 --> 10:40.807
Come on, Pistol. You and I
will check with the county

10:40.890 --> 10:42.434
on this property line business.

10:42.517 --> 10:47.605
Oh, and, Petey, no more home improvements
till I get back. Got it?

10:47.689 --> 10:51.818
Yes, rutabaga lips. Bye.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.029
Come on, Junior. We got work to do.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.698
-But Mom just said--
-Never mind.

10:56.781 --> 11:01.202
Once she sees what I've done to the place,
she'll love it.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.537
Not.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.457
]Pete] Aw, now this is livin'.

11:05.540 --> 11:10.462
I can sit in my boat and cast right
into the Goof's livin' room.

11:10.545 --> 11:11.755
Ha ha ha!

11:16.217 --> 11:18.511
Oh, yes, sir.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.264
Much roomier than my old game room.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.184
Pop, it's roomier than Yankee Stadium!

11:26.353 --> 11:31.024
Petey, I baked you a peach pit pie.
Just my way of saying-- [screams]

11:31.107 --> 11:32.984
[splat]

11:33.193 --> 11:35.153
Welcome to the livin' room?

11:36.654 --> 11:39.074
Thanks, Goof. I'm touched.

11:39.157 --> 11:43.036
Speakin' of your livin' room,
I need to check some measurements.

11:43.787 --> 11:47.791
Mm. Mm-hmm. Yep. I was right.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.876
Half of it's on my property.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.878
Huh?

11:51.961 --> 11:54.464
Aw. Tough break, Goof.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.300
Now, to avoid any unnecessary trespassin',

11:57.384 --> 12:00.220
I'm gonna have to mark off
the new borders.

12:00.303 --> 12:05.600
I don't expect any problems,
long as you stay on your side.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.022
[Goofy] Come on, Maxie. Ah-hyuck!

12:11.106 --> 12:13.274
Don't you want to watch
Ridiculous Chicken?

12:13.358 --> 12:16.736
No, thanks, Dad. I'm going outside
to hang with Peej for a while.

12:16.820 --> 12:20.573
OK, Maxie, but you're missin'
a good one. Ah-hyuck!

12:20.657 --> 12:25.370
Ridiculous Chicken sure is ridiculous!
Ah-hyuck! Ha ha!

12:25.453 --> 12:28.456
[man, over TV]
And the pitch. Strike 2!

12:28.540 --> 12:31.918
Ya no-good bub of an umpire!
What, are you blind?

12:32.002 --> 12:34.754
Oh, Petey, I'm tryin' to watch cartoonies.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.297
Tough!

12:36.381 --> 12:39.426
Don't you think
it's a little on the loud side?

12:39.509 --> 12:41.845
You think that's loud?

12:42.262 --> 12:43.888
[man]
...to center field! What a shot!

12:43.972 --> 12:49.978

13:01.656 --> 13:03.408
But now I'm not sure.

13:03.491 --> 13:07.078
Yeah. I think our dads are getting
on each other's nerves.

13:07.162 --> 13:11.166
Hey, what if they got
really mad at each other?

13:11.249 --> 13:15.003
Yeah. And ended up trashing
everything in the house?

13:15.086 --> 13:17.547

Aw, I know this has been rough on you,
Maxie, losing your bedroom and all,

14:25.824 --> 14:27.784

Hey. It's empty, Pop.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.933
Hmm.
Wasn't empty when I had something in it.

Mm. These are good, Goof. Very delicate.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.773
