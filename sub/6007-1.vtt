00:49.340 --> 00:50.520
It's an ambush!

00:58.120 --> 00:58.959
John, damn it.

00:58.960 --> 01:00.910
I've been hit! I'm down!

01:01.030 --> 01:02.780
- Pelham!
- On the west side!

01:05.790 --> 01:06.529
Pelham's down.

01:06.530 --> 01:07.329
I need you to lead me in!

01:07.330 --> 01:09.239
We don't know how many
suspects are in there.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.879
- Risking one life to save one life...
- Shut up!

01:10.880 --> 01:12.630
Lead me in! Move!

01:33.020 --> 01:34.809
Hey, buddy. So this ain't good.

01:34.810 --> 01:37.430
No, it's not. Could always be worse!

01:41.180 --> 01:42.439
It just got worse.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.120
They were ready for us, John.

01:44.450 --> 01:46.540
How did Insyndicate know
we were coming?

01:46.990 --> 01:47.989
How did they know?

01:47.990 --> 01:50.139
- MX!
- How'd they know?

01:50.140 --> 01:52.530
We're getting out of here.
Give me a diagnostic!

01:53.860 --> 01:54.779
Blood pressure's dropping,

01:54.780 --> 01:56.759
celiac artery's blown apart.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.240
There's nothing to do, sir.

01:59.740 --> 02:00.790
We're getting out of here.

02:00.800 --> 02:01.699
He will bleed to death

02:01.700 --> 02:03.269
- before you get him out of here.
- Shut up!

02:03.270 --> 02:05.400
- Cover us! We're leaving!
- I cannot do that.

02:05.410 --> 02:07.839
Others have a better statistical
chance of surviving.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.449
I need to protect them.

02:09.449 --> 02:10.709
Are you staying with your partner?

02:10.710 --> 02:12.270
You're damn right I am!

02:13.240 --> 02:15.740
Hey! Come back here!

02:16.460 --> 02:17.320
Come on.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.760
Tell me what you remember.

03:50.610 --> 03:51.690
This time...

03:52.470 --> 03:54.260
I remember the radio call.

03:54.490 --> 03:55.620
From Pelham.

03:55.910 --> 03:56.929
Your partner.

03:56.930 --> 03:58.959
- Yeah.
- But not much more than that.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.060
I still can't remember every detail.

04:02.570 --> 04:03.909
I want to go again.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.090
You made good progress tonight, John.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.470
You were in a coma

04:07.500 --> 04:09.550
for 17 months, yes?

04:09.730 --> 04:11.739
Technically, we shouldn't
be doing this procedure

04:11.740 --> 04:14.019
until you've been fully
conscious for one year.

04:14.020 --> 04:14.869
Yeah.

04:14.870 --> 04:16.769
Well, technically...

04:17.149 --> 04:19.350
you're an unlicensed doctor from SubAsia

04:19.360 --> 04:21.579
practicing black market medicine.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.089
Well, yes,

04:23.090 --> 04:25.229
you can throw me in prison if you want,

04:25.230 --> 04:30.120
but... I accepted you as a
patient out of kindness.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.050
You seemed like a desperate
man when I met you.

04:33.180 --> 04:34.190
And now?

04:34.320 --> 04:36.760
Now... you seem like a desperate man.

04:37.990 --> 04:39.129
John, I know you said

04:39.130 --> 04:41.089
the people
who ambushed you disappeared,

04:41.090 --> 04:42.709
but, despite my best efforts,

04:42.710 --> 04:44.630
you may not remember who they are.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.660
Most people come to a Recollectionist...

04:48.870 --> 04:50.760
they want to remember good things.

04:50.870 --> 04:52.370
Why can't you let this go?

04:52.380 --> 04:54.000
It's been two years.

04:54.840 --> 04:55.800
You know...

04:57.250 --> 04:58.710
they killed my team...

05:00.370 --> 05:01.800
my friends.

05:03.690 --> 05:06.700
And without this treatment,
I can't remember anything.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.630
I remembered something else this time.

05:16.410 --> 05:17.900
My ex-girlfriend.

05:18.190 --> 05:19.180
Anna.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.740
We were in my apartment.

05:23.010 --> 05:24.250
Strange.

05:24.790 --> 05:25.920
I'll, uh...

05:26.490 --> 05:29.279
refine the triggering of
that cluster next time.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.520
Your nose is bleeding.

06:17.850 --> 06:18.900
Detective.

06:19.140 --> 06:20.330
You all right?

06:21.600 --> 06:22.510
Yeah.

06:23.110 --> 06:24.600
Where's your MX?

06:24.790 --> 06:26.030
I'm off duty.

06:26.140 --> 06:28.740
- Where's your human?
- Talking to a witness.

06:28.840 --> 06:31.520
Individuals came over the wall an hour ago.

06:35.450 --> 06:36.760
Drive safely.

06:36.830 --> 06:37.810
Yeah, I will.

07:28.240 --> 07:32.099
Message saved for 738 days.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.370
Hi, honey.

07:33.380 --> 07:35.889
So, I know you're probably
still asleep, but,

07:35.890 --> 07:37.979
John, the sun is setting

07:37.980 --> 07:41.419
and it is the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

07:41.420 --> 07:42.290
Look.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.380
Your father would've loved this place.

07:47.630 --> 07:49.910
Oh, I can't wait to get back to you.

07:50.280 --> 07:53.009
I know I have to wait a week, but...

07:53.010 --> 07:54.530
what I really wish

07:55.070 --> 07:57.080
is that you were here with me.

08:14.110 --> 08:15.560
- Morning.
- Morning.

08:15.990 --> 08:18.580
- You coming in?
- I know I said I was ready.

08:19.340 --> 08:20.649
Just give me one more day.

08:20.650 --> 08:22.969
No. I already gave you one more day.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.419
And another and another.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.600
It's time, John.

08:27.390 --> 08:28.280
John?

08:29.910 --> 08:31.769
I just got a report of a
coordinated armed robbery

08:31.770 --> 08:32.870
in South Kelvin.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.650
Looks like it was Insyndicate.

08:35.490 --> 08:36.730
Insyndicate?

08:42.760 --> 08:43.669
Okay.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.670
I'll come in.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.610
Synthetic calibration incomplete.

09:00.860 --> 09:03.430
Synthetic calibration incomplete.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.700
Synthetic calibration incompl...

09:12.460 --> 09:14.209
I can't access the system.
Are you in?

09:14.210 --> 09:16.469
- I'm in.
- I'm not in. I'm out.

09:16.470 --> 09:17.909
All my files are locked.

09:17.910 --> 09:20.160
Sounds like Martinez is
messing with you again.

09:20.340 --> 09:21.369
We're supposed to be in a truce,

09:21.370 --> 09:23.890
so, if that's true,
I'm gonna kill him.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.650
Well, there is one other possibility.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.189
Did you forget your password again,

09:28.190 --> 09:29.390
Detective Vogel?

09:33.230 --> 09:35.550
Not bad for a guy who's
been asleep for two years.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.450
I wouldn't say that.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.390
He looks weak, to me.

09:41.880 --> 09:42.830
Richard,

09:42.910 --> 09:45.560
I know this won't be easy
for you: don't be a prick.

09:45.570 --> 09:47.680
This department's handled
affairs just fine without him.

09:47.690 --> 09:48.829
What's your problem with Kennex?

09:48.830 --> 09:50.739
Don't ask to hear the story...
you'll die of boredom.

09:50.740 --> 09:52.159
And exposure to severe envy.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.750
Look, there's nothing
to envy in him.

09:54.570 --> 09:56.119
Kennex oversaw that raid,

09:56.120 --> 09:58.649
controlled all the intel
and got his team ambushed.

09:58.650 --> 10:02.110
Everyone, except the one man
responsible... Kennex... was killed.

10:02.170 --> 10:03.719
Should've been discharged.

10:03.720 --> 10:04.630
Richard.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.550
He won't last.

10:07.110 --> 10:08.280
You just watch.

10:21.030 --> 10:23.640
Kennex, John. Registration complete.

10:23.830 --> 10:24.880
Thanks.

10:26.650 --> 10:27.799
Detective Kennex,

10:27.800 --> 10:30.300
I'm 785. I've been assigned to you.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.709
I'm aware this is your first day back.

10:33.710 --> 10:36.069
I only want to make your
acclimation to active duty

10:36.070 --> 10:37.929
as smooth as possible for you.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.529
I'm here to attend to all your n...

10:39.530 --> 10:41.709
I'm not driving with
one of those things.

10:41.710 --> 10:44.090
Human partner was good
enough for my father.

10:44.130 --> 10:45.389
It's good enough for me.

10:45.390 --> 10:46.499
Since you were last here,

10:46.500 --> 10:48.259
MX partners have become mandatory.

10:48.260 --> 10:50.509
I'm not gonna fight you on some
kind of regulation thing, okay?

10:50.510 --> 10:52.680
- I'm not doing it.
- Like hell you're not.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.519
Have you read Tilden's profile of you?

10:54.520 --> 10:56.979
And, by the way, he is a
very capable psychiatrist.

10:56.980 --> 10:59.119
"Kennex should return to service never. "

10:59.120 --> 11:01.929
- Never? Wow, that's... that's a long time.
- "Kennex is suffering

11:01.930 --> 11:03.660
"From depression, mental atrophy,

11:03.670 --> 11:06.099
"Trauma onset OCD, PTSD

11:06.100 --> 11:08.979
and psychological rejection
of his synthetic body parts. "

11:08.980 --> 11:10.710
Well, that last part is true.

11:13.780 --> 11:16.449
Listen, you're the only person
more desperate than I am

11:16.450 --> 11:18.829
to find out how Insyndicate
learned about the raid.

11:18.830 --> 11:20.850
If we work together, we can do it.

11:21.630 --> 11:23.340
This happened a few hours ago.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.399
Robbery target was an armored
truck, carrying bio research.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.999
If this is an Insyndicate operation,

11:32.000 --> 11:33.910
it might help us learn more about them.

11:34.050 --> 11:35.109
What's the connection?

11:35.110 --> 11:37.849
Parabolic pulse charge was
used to stop the vehicle.

11:37.850 --> 11:39.920
I haven't seen that since the ambush.

11:42.820 --> 11:44.679
Well, sure looks like Insyndicate.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.870
- Inventory report?
- That's not in yet.

11:47.140 --> 11:47.929
Whatever they wanted,

11:47.930 --> 11:50.190
they killed four security guards
to get it.

11:52.660 --> 11:53.819
One of the thieves was shot.

11:53.820 --> 11:55.450
He's being treated at County.

11:56.490 --> 11:57.360
John?

11:58.380 --> 12:01.030
Keep the Insyndicate
connection between us, okay?

12:01.850 --> 12:04.220
You think someone in the
department's working with them?

12:05.590 --> 12:07.330
You're the only guy I trust here.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.179
Okay.

12:11.180 --> 12:12.380
I'll check it out.

12:14.460 --> 12:15.450
One more thing.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.170
Go easy on your partner.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.210
Come.

12:35.570 --> 12:37.689
Truck belongs
to a private lab run by Omni,

12:37.690 --> 12:39.940
company specializing in DNA research.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.819
According to the manager,
they were transporting vials

12:42.820 --> 12:45.840
of single-strand synthetic,
programmable DNA.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.629
Detective? Valerie Stahl.

12:48.630 --> 12:49.579
John Kennex.

12:49.580 --> 12:51.400
- Pleasure to meet you.
- You, too.

12:52.450 --> 12:53.189
Okay.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.760
So tell me what you got
on programmable DNA.

12:55.770 --> 12:58.099
Programmable DNA can be used to trigger

12:58.100 --> 12:59.459
the process of tissue creation.

12:59.460 --> 13:01.980
For example, to grow sets
of organs in humans,

13:01.990 --> 13:03.419
possibly for harvest.

13:03.420 --> 13:04.639
What else was taken?

13:04.640 --> 13:08.070
Acid, bencarmidium, thianel,
Myklon Red.

13:10.560 --> 13:11.750
Myklon Red.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.670
Myklon Red, Myklon Red...

13:21.670 --> 13:22.660
Detective?

13:26.360 --> 13:27.820
Detective, you okay?

13:30.050 --> 13:31.770
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

13:33.430 --> 13:35.200
This sector is Khmer Black territory.

13:35.210 --> 13:37.669
They've been known to traffic
in biotech in the past.

13:37.670 --> 13:39.650
We're rounding up the usual suspects.

13:40.330 --> 13:41.550
You don't buy it?

13:42.380 --> 13:44.799
Ruby Mah assumed leadership
of the gang six months ago

13:44.800 --> 13:46.029
when his brother was killed.

13:46.030 --> 13:47.080
It was controversial.

13:47.090 --> 13:48.489
He's seen as too Western.

13:48.490 --> 13:50.570
He needs to show the
people he's traditional.

13:50.970 --> 13:52.709
Today is the last day of
the Cambodian New Year,

13:52.710 --> 13:55.380
Loeung Sakk, a day of
repentance for wrongdoing.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.410
He wouldn't commit violence today.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.720
This was another gang.

14:00.230 --> 14:03.950
I find behavioral tendencies in data
and identify criminal patterns.

14:04.610 --> 14:07.640
Or didn't intelligence analysts
do that before I got here?

14:08.890 --> 14:11.440
Thanks. I, uh...
I really appreciate it.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.060
Excuse me.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.250
Sure.

14:29.170 --> 14:30.399
Tell command we're 10-19.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.730
What happened back there?

14:32.150 --> 14:33.530
What are you talking about?

14:35.260 --> 14:37.180
It seemed like a petit mal seizure.

14:37.220 --> 14:39.079
I will need to report what I saw.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.689
I'm fine.
You're not gonna report anything.

14:40.690 --> 14:42.750
You were in Koln Avenue
District last night.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.219
An MX saw you there.

14:44.220 --> 14:45.890
I am concerned, Detective.

14:45.940 --> 14:49.029
That area is populated by numerous
black market medical clinics.

14:49.030 --> 14:51.070
And some tasty noodle joints.

14:53.730 --> 14:55.790
Look, I appreciate your concern,

14:55.990 --> 14:57.790
but there's nothing to report.

15:14.370 --> 15:16.749
Another curious thing, Detective Kennex?

15:16.750 --> 15:19.789
Last night, there were no comestible
trace particles on your breath,

15:19.790 --> 15:21.829
indicating you were not there for noodles.

15:21.830 --> 15:22.910
I think we should...

15:37.960 --> 15:38.990
Hey, Rudy.

15:42.160 --> 15:43.980
As I live and breathe.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.630
Or should I say,
as you live and breathe?

15:46.640 --> 15:47.840
How are ya?

15:48.070 --> 15:50.480
Constantly turning down party invitations.

15:50.660 --> 15:52.829
I've become quite popular with the ladies.

15:52.830 --> 15:54.330
How can I help?

15:56.120 --> 15:58.700
I got a rec order for another synthetic.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.010
He fell?

16:01.740 --> 16:03.299
Out of a moving car?

16:03.300 --> 16:04.220
Yeah, crazy, huh?

16:04.230 --> 16:06.869
Must be some kind of software issue.

16:06.870 --> 16:08.420
Gonna need a new one.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.460
Software?

16:13.430 --> 16:16.029
Since we don't have any MXs available,

16:16.030 --> 16:18.969
department's only cleared
one model for active duty.

16:18.970 --> 16:20.349
Funny, actually. This, uh...

16:20.350 --> 16:24.980
this unit was scheduled to be
transferred to NASA next month.

16:25.520 --> 16:26.789
It's sad really.

16:26.790 --> 16:27.859
He's scrap metal.

16:27.860 --> 16:30.850
The trimidium circuits
in his spinal column are

16:30.860 --> 16:32.970
worth more than the whole of him.

16:36.850 --> 16:39.169
Wait a minute. That's...
that's one of the crazy ones.

16:39.170 --> 16:42.559
What? No. That's rude.
Not crazy, per se.

16:42.560 --> 16:43.719
You know, they had their...

16:43.720 --> 16:47.140
What? Problems?
Who doesn't have problems?

16:48.250 --> 16:51.079
Technically, they're perfectly functional.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.230
Look at him.

16:52.250 --> 16:53.850
He's road-worthy.

16:54.820 --> 16:58.210
John, Dorian. Dorian, John.

17:04.180 --> 17:05.769
There. Should be functional.

17:05.770 --> 17:07.359
His DF was bad.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.999
Anything I need to know?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.519
Well, the DRN series...

17:10.520 --> 17:13.739
they were based on a program
called Synthetic Soul.

17:13.740 --> 17:16.289
And while he isn't crazy, as you say,

17:16.290 --> 17:17.848
there may be some bugs.

17:17.849 --> 17:19.419
Bugs? What kind of bugs?

17:19.420 --> 17:23.398
Some of them had difficulty dealing
with their emotive regulations.

17:23.400 --> 17:24.509
Emotional issues.

17:24.510 --> 17:27.589
The idea behind the DRNs was
to be as human as possible.

17:27.589 --> 17:28.749
And the truth is that

17:28.750 --> 17:31.489
it's human to have unexpected
emotional responses.

17:31.490 --> 17:35.749
And if, uh, being as close
to human was the goal, then,

17:35.750 --> 17:39.229
I guess the DRNs weren't
such a failure after all.

17:39.230 --> 17:41.350
People have breaking points, and...

17:41.530 --> 17:43.039
so do DRNs.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.649
So you're saying he's a basket case.

17:44.650 --> 17:47.980
Not words I would use, or agree with.

17:49.380 --> 17:50.679
All right, plug it in already.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.530
- I got to get back on the street.
- Okay.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.680
Please have the honor of
waking him up yourself.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.260
Touch it against his left ear.

18:16.910 --> 18:18.700
How long was I out?

18:18.760 --> 18:22.350
Uh, four years and three months.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.390
Detective John Kennex.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.969
I'm Dorian. How are you?

18:40.970 --> 18:42.899
Your record is outstanding.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.249
Used to be.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.509
Excuse me?

18:45.510 --> 18:47.630
Update your files. Let's go.

18:53.770 --> 18:55.130
Hey, boss.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.979
He's on the move. Let's go!

19:01.980 --> 19:03.560
You heard him. Let's go.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.070
So what do I call you?

19:24.150 --> 19:25.570
Detective.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.809
Well, Detective, this sure beats
repairing thermal insulation tiles

19:28.810 --> 19:30.660
on the C.N.A. Space Station.

19:33.930 --> 19:36.540
I was decommissioned four
years ago, as you know.

19:37.890 --> 19:39.749
Why am I in this car with you?

19:39.750 --> 19:42.120
I'm required to ride with a synthetic.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.930
I'm not a huge fan of that term.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.329
St. Christopher.

19:51.330 --> 19:53.410
This has to be a gift from someone.
Am I right?

19:53.420 --> 19:55.789
Something like 80% of
these are given as gifts.

19:55.790 --> 19:57.710
Synthetics are precise.

19:58.070 --> 19:59.150
There's that term again.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.489
You just said, "Something like 80%."

20:00.490 --> 20:03.459
The actual statistic is 83.42%,

20:03.460 --> 20:05.129
but I'm running my colloquialism routine,

20:05.130 --> 20:07.870
so I express most data
conversationally, man.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.220
Terrific.

20:11.850 --> 20:13.320
So, who's "A"?

20:13.640 --> 20:16.749
Addison? Annie? Adeline?

20:16.750 --> 20:18.529
Alana? Anita?

20:18.530 --> 20:21.310
Amy? Audrey? Aquamarine?

20:21.320 --> 20:22.669
Okay, that's enough, all right?

20:22.670 --> 20:25.560
Um... synthetic off.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.820
Synthetic off?

20:29.930 --> 20:31.679
Does that mean you want me to be quiet?

20:31.680 --> 20:33.879
Yeah, whatever the mode
is for you to be quiet,

20:33.880 --> 20:34.759
just do that.

20:34.760 --> 20:37.409
Hey, man, I can be quiet.

20:37.410 --> 20:40.570
You can just... ask.

20:42.870 --> 20:45.780
Synthetic calibration incomplete.

20:46.710 --> 20:49.530
Synthetic calibration incomplete.

20:56.660 --> 20:58.240
Stand by. I'll be back.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.180
Here you go, ma'am.

21:07.770 --> 21:10.890
Yeah, give me a black coffee, no sugar.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.510
You got it, Detective Vogel.

21:21.150 --> 21:23.170
Officer Vogel,
it's good to see you again.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.440
Who are you?

21:49.270 --> 21:51.870
Haven't seen one of those
synthetics for years.

21:52.420 --> 21:53.760
It's perfect.

21:54.260 --> 21:56.079
Two cops from the scrap heap.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.280
This is gonna be more
pathetic than I thought.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.600
Those are the models that replaced me.

22:04.390 --> 22:05.920
Intimidating.

22:06.630 --> 22:08.900
Go register so we can get moving.

22:20.630 --> 22:22.889
DRN registration complete.

22:22.890 --> 22:24.060
Hey, bot.

22:24.930 --> 22:26.500
Don't snap on us, now.

22:31.230 --> 22:33.829
Sir, Detective Vogel's been abducted.

22:33.830 --> 22:35.609
Maldonado wants you on it.

22:35.610 --> 22:37.509
His MX was destroyed.

22:37.510 --> 22:38.829
This is all we could get off it.

22:38.830 --> 22:39.979
Based on the masks,

22:39.980 --> 22:42.190
these are the same guys
from the armed robbery.

22:43.750 --> 22:45.480
Suspect back from County?

22:48.110 --> 22:50.609
Your gang kills four security guards.

22:50.610 --> 22:52.389
Now you've taken a cop.

22:52.390 --> 22:53.880
Where is he?

22:56.580 --> 22:58.810
Did they take him 'cause we have you?

23:03.820 --> 23:05.370
You know what this is?

23:05.390 --> 23:06.859
It's your booking file.

23:06.860 --> 23:09.710
It describes the condition
you were in when we got you.

23:10.240 --> 23:11.310
Now...

23:12.380 --> 23:15.040
What are you doing with programmable DNA?

23:16.650 --> 23:18.810
What's the Myklon Red for?

23:26.630 --> 23:28.989
Oh, look, suspect has
a scratch above his eye.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.599
I have no idea how he got that.

23:30.600 --> 23:34.230
Better add it, and get ready
to write down "missing molar".

23:34.770 --> 23:37.020
There are other ways, Detective.

23:37.830 --> 23:40.590
I'm questioning this man, okay, not you.

23:43.940 --> 23:44.910
Now...

23:45.810 --> 23:48.540
Synthetic fail. Calibration required.

23:48.680 --> 23:51.520
Synthetic fail. Calibration required.

23:52.170 --> 23:53.500
Synthetic fa...

23:57.740 --> 23:59.530
You shot yourself.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.339
Perhaps it was a bit crazy this morning,

24:02.340 --> 24:04.659
maybe the doctors at County even missed it,

24:04.660 --> 24:06.409
but the trajectory of the
bullet that hit you,

24:06.410 --> 24:08.099
the burn marks on your flesh...

24:08.100 --> 24:09.399
basically there's no chance

24:09.400 --> 24:12.280
that you were hit by a bullet
from any gun but your own.

24:16.090 --> 24:17.550
Is that true?

24:23.490 --> 24:25.699
You don't know the people I work for.

24:25.700 --> 24:26.819
Trust me, I do.

24:26.820 --> 24:29.179
I needed to get away from
them any way I could,

24:29.180 --> 24:30.839
because there's no getting away from them.

24:30.840 --> 24:31.819
Look, we can help you,

24:31.820 --> 24:33.939
we can keep you safe, but you
need to give us information.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.929
No, I'm not safe anywhere, not even here.

24:35.930 --> 24:37.899
We'll put you in a secure
location under guard.

24:37.900 --> 24:40.439
No one will find you,
but you need to talk.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.539
I need to be somewhere safe.

24:42.540 --> 24:44.560
Then, where's Detective Vogel?

24:46.310 --> 24:47.920
What's the address?

24:49.760 --> 24:52.800
325 Grand, Apartment 6.

25:00.010 --> 25:01.429
Not that you need me to tell you this,

25:01.430 --> 25:03.999
but you just violated the crap
out of that guy's civil rights.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.619
Fantastic, I get the synthetic
with the bleeding heart.

25:06.620 --> 25:08.409
Look, I don't care what
you're programmed to do.

25:08.410 --> 25:09.509
You report what happened in there

25:09.510 --> 25:11.449
and you'll find yourself
bouncing down the 604.

25:11.450 --> 25:13.559
Detective,
if I'm going to report anything,

25:13.560 --> 25:16.440
it is because I decided
it needed to be reported.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.790
I feel sick.

25:30.590 --> 25:32.260
I need a toilet.

25:53.860 --> 25:55.210
You all right?

25:55.580 --> 25:57.320
I'll be fine.

26:21.080 --> 26:21.999
Stop.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.820
Potential explosive device.

26:23.830 --> 26:24.939
Humans back.

26:24.940 --> 26:26.750
Evacuate the building.

26:29.270 --> 26:33.500
DRN, halt advancement, halt advancement.

26:44.980 --> 26:46.430
Detective.

26:53.300 --> 26:54.560
What is it?

26:55.200 --> 26:56.900
It's not a bomb.

26:57.420 --> 26:59.650
That trip wire leads somewhere.

27:00.550 --> 27:01.619
I'll lead you in?

27:01.620 --> 27:03.450
I do not advise that, sir.

27:07.390 --> 27:08.640
Let's go.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.630
Vogel.

27:33.370 --> 27:34.449
Help!

27:34.450 --> 27:35.510
Stay calm.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.319
Kennex, help me!

27:37.320 --> 27:38.650
Help!

27:40.010 --> 27:42.090
Do something!

27:45.370 --> 27:46.919
Bulletproof glass.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.360
It's welded shut.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.540
Patel speaking.

27:56.550 --> 27:57.709
Patel, where are you?

27:57.710 --> 27:59.400
En route to the safe house.

27:59.410 --> 28:00.169
We have the perp in the car.

28:00.170 --> 28:02.420
Okay, turn around... this
whole thing's a setup.

28:03.150 --> 28:05.720
Patel, Patel.

28:10.970 --> 28:13.060
No, no, no, no...

28:23.460 --> 28:25.999
Sergeant Patel and two other
officers were killed,

28:26.000 --> 28:28.899
three MXs were destroyed,
and the suspect escaped.

28:28.900 --> 28:30.310
It's about time.

28:39.740 --> 28:40.880
I'm sorry.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.169
Morgue lab is too slow.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.019
Get a lab box,
take a sample of his blood,

28:59.020 --> 29:00.899
and send it to Rudy for analysis.

29:00.900 --> 29:02.660
Don't need a lab box.

29:16.690 --> 29:18.539
I just downloaded the information.

29:18.540 --> 29:20.250
Rudy should have the data now.

29:21.790 --> 29:23.130
Why him?

29:23.360 --> 29:24.950
Why target Vogel?

29:33.810 --> 29:35.249
Scan every case Vogel was on.

29:35.250 --> 29:36.549
Any connection to biotech, science,

29:36.550 --> 29:37.969
medicine, DNA.

29:37.970 --> 29:39.290
I want to see it.

29:43.550 --> 29:45.449
I don't know if this is anything,

29:45.450 --> 29:47.210
but one of his files is missing.

29:47.220 --> 29:50.079
Case file number 6663.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.959
It's gone from all internal records.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.609
Wait a minute, Detective
Vogel told me this morning

29:53.610 --> 29:55.639
that he couldn't get
access to his terminal.

29:55.640 --> 29:58.390
Maybe whoever took him
was deleting the file.

30:00.620 --> 30:02.259
They got into the whole system.

30:02.260 --> 30:03.030
Who is they?

30:03.040 --> 30:05.189
See if anyone downstairs
can get that file back.

30:05.190 --> 30:06.390
On my way.

30:10.480 --> 30:11.860
The way you said that...

30:12.350 --> 30:14.659
you're thinking someone
specific is behind this.

30:14.660 --> 30:15.539
Who?

30:15.540 --> 30:17.610
When I want your help,
I'll ask for it.

30:23.720 --> 30:24.979
You know what your problem is?

30:24.980 --> 30:26.529
Always my favorite part of the day:

30:26.530 --> 30:28.389
a synthetic telling me
what my problem is.

30:28.390 --> 30:30.030
There's that word again.

30:30.720 --> 30:32.879
Your problem is,
you don't know yourself.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.370
You don't trust anyone.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.699
Is that my problem?

30:35.700 --> 30:37.410
And, man, I don't blame you.

30:37.710 --> 30:38.729
After all you've been through,

30:38.730 --> 30:40.899
if I were like you, I
wouldn't know myself either.

30:40.900 --> 30:42.839
Okay, firstly stop saying "Man. "

30:42.840 --> 30:44.700
Secondly you're not like me.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.110
And I'm not like them.

30:46.130 --> 30:48.460
MX units are logic-based
and rule-oriented.

30:48.470 --> 30:49.789
They have no true free will

30:49.790 --> 30:51.909
and they are designed to feel nothing.

30:51.910 --> 30:53.389
Now, I can't say that I was born,

30:53.390 --> 30:55.740
I can't say I grew in a
womb or had a childhood,

30:55.860 --> 30:59.040
but I was made to feel and I do

30:59.270 --> 31:00.560
as much as you.

31:01.380 --> 31:02.489
I read what you wrote:

31:02.490 --> 31:04.709
that if an MX hadn't left you
behind to save some others,

31:04.710 --> 31:07.409
your partner might have made
it out of that ambush alive,

31:07.410 --> 31:11.539
and that part may be true,
but I read the whole report.

31:11.540 --> 31:12.900
By the time the ambush had begun,

31:12.910 --> 31:15.409
it was already too late and
it was you who led them in,

31:15.410 --> 31:19.310
so you can blame an MX or
you can blame yourself.

31:19.530 --> 31:20.829
- Okay, you know what?
- I am nothing like an MX-43.

31:20.830 --> 31:22.609
You're obviously malfunctioning right now.

31:22.610 --> 31:25.060
Why don't you just take a
second to reboot yourself?

31:24.180 --> 31:25.260
If anyone is malfunctioning,
it is you, Kennex.

31:25.270 --> 31:26.089
You know what I'm gonna stop doing?

31:26.090 --> 31:29.520
I'm gonna stop arguing with a piece
of silicon and carbon fiber.

31:31.320 --> 31:32.049
Kennex.

31:32.050 --> 31:32.849
It's Rudy.

31:32.850 --> 31:34.109
All police in the department

31:34.110 --> 31:36.260
are required to have mandatory inoculations

31:36.270 --> 31:39.069
designed in police labs for officers only.

31:39.070 --> 31:41.010
Those inoculations are
meant to keep cops safe.

31:41.320 --> 31:45.429
Protects against biowarfare,
gases, pathogens, et cetera.

31:45.430 --> 31:47.999
We found Myklon Red in Vogel's blood,

31:48.000 --> 31:49.949
combined with programmable DNA.

31:49.950 --> 31:52.599
It targets the inoculation directly.

31:52.600 --> 31:55.680
It's like getting a hundred
different diseases at once.

31:55.690 --> 31:57.389
The immune system goes berserk.

31:57.390 --> 31:58.439
What are you saying, Rudy?

31:58.440 --> 32:00.909
That's why his body reacted
in the way that it did.

32:00.910 --> 32:02.880
That's why he died.

32:03.480 --> 32:06.399
I believe Detective Vogel
was a test subject.

32:06.400 --> 32:07.839
Whoever we're up against...

32:07.840 --> 32:09.370
They're targeting cops.

32:16.140 --> 32:17.320
Where are you going?

32:19.970 --> 32:20.779
I cannot allow you to do this.

32:20.780 --> 32:21.690
It's far too soon.

32:21.700 --> 32:23.689
Look, this isn't about me, okay?

32:23.690 --> 32:25.479
Someone is killing police officers,

32:25.480 --> 32:26.919
and the only way we're gonna find them

32:26.920 --> 32:29.039
is if I remember more about
the people who are doing it.

32:29.040 --> 32:31.629
John, it's not safe for you.

32:31.630 --> 32:34.230
You do this and you do it now.

32:43.020 --> 32:44.419
They were ready for us, John.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.139
How did Insyndicate know we were coming?

32:46.140 --> 32:48.260
How did they know? How'd they...?

32:50.690 --> 32:53.600
Hey, come back here!
You're damn rob...!

33:27.790 --> 33:28.369
I am so sorry.

33:28.370 --> 33:30.460
I told him it was too dangerous.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.310
You used my locator chip.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.700
Maldonado wanted me
to keep an eye on you.

33:49.650 --> 33:50.610
Okay.

33:56.320 --> 33:59.030
You're lucky you got the partner
with the bleeding heart.

34:13.300 --> 34:16.790
What did you see... when you were under?

34:25.889 --> 34:29.210
I saw someone who was close to me.

34:29.510 --> 34:32.659
Someone who, I realize now,

34:32.659 --> 34:35.909
that I should never have trusted.

34:38.290 --> 34:41.230
I want to say I... I'm not
even sure it's real, but...

34:44.969 --> 34:46.100
But it was.

34:49.630 --> 34:51.060
Who was it, John?

34:54.120 --> 34:55.940
It was my ex-girlfriend.

34:57.640 --> 35:00.380
When I came out of my coma,
she had disappeared.

35:04.790 --> 35:06.040
Now I know why.

35:10.170 --> 35:11.009
Synthetic fail.

35:11.010 --> 35:12.620
Calibration required.

35:13.010 --> 35:15.129
Synthetic fail.
Calibration required.

35:15.130 --> 35:16.580
I've got a fix for that.

35:17.790 --> 35:18.609
What?

35:18.610 --> 35:20.319
It gets creaky sometimes?

35:20.320 --> 35:21.920
I've got a fix for that.

35:22.090 --> 35:23.260
Olive oil.

35:24.170 --> 35:25.439
Olive oil?

35:25.440 --> 35:27.689
Yeah, man.
You put it right on the joint.

35:27.690 --> 35:28.860
Olive oil?

35:28.930 --> 35:30.300
You'll thank me.

35:37.820 --> 35:39.710
I suppose I, uh...

35:40.440 --> 35:43.820
I should acknowledge the
fact that you saved my life.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.620
No need.

35:49.870 --> 35:51.889
I only did it
because you're my one ticket.

35:51.890 --> 35:53.779
Without you, I'm off the force.

35:53.780 --> 35:55.910
You're lucky I want to be a cop so bad.

36:01.860 --> 36:05.340
You're not like them, the MXs.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.149
I don't know why, but you're not.

36:07.150 --> 36:09.260
I should take that as a compliment.

36:10.560 --> 36:11.620
You should.

36:15.290 --> 36:18.159
The MX series is based on first
order predicate calculus.

36:18.160 --> 36:21.340
MXs have no intuition, or
as you might say, no soul.

36:21.450 --> 36:25.289
For them, experience, memory
is just recorded data.

36:25.290 --> 36:27.839
My series is designed
to draw conclusions,

36:27.840 --> 36:29.340
make inferences.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.209
The answer is Vogel, right?

36:33.210 --> 36:36.650
Who was targeting him,
what was the payback for?

36:36.830 --> 36:37.740
Yeah.

36:37.750 --> 36:40.349
And the only witness we have
is Vogel's MX,

36:40.350 --> 36:42.099
Who was blown apart
when they took Vogel.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.369
Yeah, Ru-Rudy said his neural
net was completely fried.

36:44.370 --> 36:45.739
Worthless to another MX,

36:45.740 --> 36:48.469
who wouldn't be able to-to put it
together, to make sense of it,

36:48.470 --> 36:50.380
but you could make those connections.

36:51.060 --> 36:52.619
If we transferred the memory,

36:52.620 --> 36:55.860
or whatever's left of the
memory from Vogel's MX to you,

36:56.320 --> 36:58.230
you could make the connection.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.219
It's worth a shot, Detective.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.660
Check, please!

37:46.730 --> 37:48.800
I'm in its short-term memory now.

37:54.890 --> 37:56.049
Stand by. I'll be back.

37:56.050 --> 37:57.710
coffee... sugar.

38:00.130 --> 38:00.899
Officer Vogel.

38:00.900 --> 38:02.449
It's good to see you again.

38:02.450 --> 38:06.149
A few years ago, you logged
something into evidence

38:06.150 --> 38:07.559
that doesn't belong to you.

38:07.560 --> 38:10.770
You may remember it as case number 6663.

38:11.070 --> 38:12.290
No?

38:12.480 --> 38:15.019
Well, your precinct has been kind
enough to hold it in evidence,

38:15.020 --> 38:18.410
but tonight, we're gonna get it back,

38:18.420 --> 38:20.340
and you're gonna help us do it.

38:25.930 --> 38:27.780
We've got something they want.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.139
Captain, we need to go into lockdown.

38:30.140 --> 38:31.179
What's going on?

38:31.180 --> 38:32.219
They're hitting us tonight.

38:32.220 --> 38:34.270
They're after something
in the evidence room!

38:39.900 --> 38:41.960
Light it up, take out the MXs.

39:13.990 --> 39:15.640
The Insyndicates are on the roof!

39:15.810 --> 39:17.800
Come on, now. Go, go, go, go, go!

39:18.790 --> 39:20.230
Evacuate building.

39:25.850 --> 39:26.479
Evacuate building.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.059
Why are they shutting down
and not you?

39:28.060 --> 39:30.350
They run on a different
frequency than mine.

39:30.940 --> 39:33.260
Sometimes newer technology isn't better.

39:34.540 --> 39:35.600
Come on.

39:46.820 --> 39:47.990
Open the valves.

41:55.090 --> 41:57.140
We got to go through
every piece by hand.

41:57.180 --> 41:58.889
We don't even know
what we're looking for.

41:58.890 --> 41:59.989
We know it's here.

41:59.990 --> 42:01.469
And we know it's valuable
because they were willing

42:01.470 --> 42:03.220
to kill a lot of cops to get it.

42:04.970 --> 42:05.739
There must be some way

42:05.740 --> 42:08.350
to restore those evidence
files that were wiped.

42:09.060 --> 42:13.350
I've been trying, but the
sabotage was extremely thorough.

42:16.570 --> 42:17.930
I'll keep trying.

42:19.770 --> 42:20.940
Thanks, man.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.440
Rise...

42:44.670 --> 42:46.310
and be counted.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.250
Stay out of trouble.

42:51.610 --> 42:54.050
Your father would have loved this place.

42:56.570 --> 42:58.920
Oh, I can't wait to get back to you.

42:59.630 --> 43:01.590
I know I have to wait a week,

43:01.600 --> 43:06.140
but what I really wish is
that you were here with me.

43:14.170 --> 43:15.620
We're gonna find her, John.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.420
If you hadn't come back...

43:30.400 --> 43:32.230
You saved a lot of lives.

43:35.980 --> 43:37.050
Thanks.

43:38.420 --> 43:39.980
Thanks for insisting.

43:49.310 --> 43:50.980
You put in the rec order.

43:51.470 --> 43:53.869
For Dorian.
I checked out his record.

43:53.870 --> 43:55.519
It's mostly redacted, but
I saw that it was you

43:55.520 --> 43:58.360
who put in the request
for me to get him. Why?

43:58.970 --> 44:00.670
The DRN is good for you.

44:04.920 --> 44:08.670
Sandra... you didn't answer my question.

44:08.740 --> 44:10.010
Why Dorian?

44:10.850 --> 44:12.130
'Cause he's special.

44:12.970 --> 44:14.020
Just like you.

44:15.580 --> 44:16.970
See you at roll call.

44:26.390 --> 44:28.980
I assume you want quiet mode, Detective?

44:32.750 --> 44:34.200
Not necessarily.

44:38.200 --> 44:39.350
Call me John.
