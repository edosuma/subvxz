00:01.653 --> 00:04.134
[arrows whooshing]

00:11.228 --> 00:14.144
[thunder rumbling]

00:42.216 --> 00:43.956
[Boy in recording] What is it?

00:45.523 --> 00:47.134
[Girl in recording] Can
you stop filming me?

00:47.177 --> 00:48.265
[Boy] Yeah.

00:50.137 --> 00:52.139
-It's a heart.
-Little heart?

00:55.533 --> 01:00.495
-[pensive music]
-[students chattering]

01:02.888 --> 01:04.194
[Teacher] All right,
settle down, class.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.457
-[hands clap]
-[Teacher] Hey.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.243
Settle down, class?

01:10.548 --> 01:12.289
Thank you.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.074
We have a guest here that
would like to talk to you

01:14.117 --> 01:16.598
about a very important issue.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.774
-Detective Mitchell?
-Thank you.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.210
Hi everyone.

01:20.254 --> 01:21.472
I'm investigating
the disappearance

01:21.515 --> 01:23.648
of your classmate,
Melissa Brown.

01:23.692 --> 01:25.476
A daughter, a sister,

01:25.520 --> 01:27.565
and a dear friend
of many of you.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.393
This case has been
frustrating and heartbreaking

01:29.437 --> 01:30.873
for all concerned.

01:30.916 --> 01:32.744
Unfortunately, at this
point in the case,

01:32.788 --> 01:34.485
we suspect foul play.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.922
Any detail could be
vitally important

01:36.966 --> 01:38.315
in helping us locate her.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.187
[Teacher] And as always,
Counselor Fink's office

01:40.229 --> 01:43.190
is always open if you
guys need to talk.

01:43.233 --> 01:44.452
Okay?

01:44.495 --> 01:45.235
Notebooks out.

01:45.279 --> 01:48.151
[school bell ringing]

01:48.195 --> 01:50.719
[pensive music]

01:54.201 --> 01:56.203
[students chattering]

02:06.213 --> 02:08.606
[tense music]

02:29.453 --> 02:31.151
You know this girl?

02:35.807 --> 02:37.200
Hey, Schroder.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.247
What's up?

02:40.290 --> 02:42.336
Hey, so this is
kind of awkward,

02:42.379 --> 02:46.122
but your dad is on the
board at Penbrook, right?

02:46.166 --> 02:48.603
You want me to put in a good
word for you, don't you?

02:48.646 --> 02:50.430
Someone else already
asked you to do that?

02:50.474 --> 02:52.128
Yeah, just you and every other

02:52.172 --> 02:54.565
scholarship kid at this school.

02:54.609 --> 02:57.873
Well, difference is I'm
actually just wait listed.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.527
So, I was thinking
maybe if your dad

02:59.570 --> 03:01.181
could write me a letter
of recommendation

03:01.224 --> 03:02.356
that would help swing
things in my favor?

03:02.399 --> 03:04.096
Yeah, that's not
really how this works,

03:04.140 --> 03:06.534
but I wouldn't expect
you to understand that.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.492
I mean, we barely
even know each other.

03:10.059 --> 03:13.193
We've been in every class
together since freshman year.

03:14.629 --> 03:15.934
Right. Uh...

03:15.978 --> 03:18.459
Maybe you should just
call my dad's office.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.287
I have tried, multiple times.

03:20.329 --> 03:22.637
His secretary just keeps
telling me that he's busy.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.552
So I thought--

03:24.595 --> 03:25.335
There you go.

03:25.379 --> 03:26.510
He's a busy guy.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.033
His dad's a fucking
congressman, bro.

03:28.077 --> 03:29.470
-[Shroder] Busy guy.
-What the fuck do you expect?

03:29.513 --> 03:31.472
Hey, are you still having your

03:31.515 --> 03:33.213
Heaven and Hell party tonight?

03:34.605 --> 03:36.390
Do you see this man's face?

03:36.433 --> 03:38.392
Yeah, it's to be expected.

03:39.915 --> 03:41.829
[Kendra] It's a theme party, in
case you didn't catch that.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.353
[car starting up, doors closing]

03:52.057 --> 03:53.058
Hey.

03:53.537 --> 03:54.321
Hey.

03:55.365 --> 03:56.497
Well, what was that?

03:56.540 --> 03:59.935
Um, we're gonna go to
a party tonight.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.415
-His party?
-Yeah.

04:01.458 --> 04:02.416
Yeah, no way am I going.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.418
Yes, it's gonna be fun.

04:04.461 --> 04:05.245
We hate fun.

04:05.288 --> 04:06.289
Well, this...

04:07.899 --> 04:10.598
Is this about Penbrook?

04:10.641 --> 04:12.208
Okay, so what's your plan?

04:12.252 --> 04:14.341
You're gonna, what, use
Schroder to get to his dad?

04:14.384 --> 04:15.777
I don't know, I don't know.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.430
I don't know, this
might be my only chance,

04:17.474 --> 04:19.128
and you're not gonna
leave me behind.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.695
Of course not, but
we're not even invited.

04:20.738 --> 04:23.393
You don't have to be invited
to a high school party,

04:23.437 --> 04:26.135
you just show up...um,

04:26.178 --> 04:27.528
in themed costumes.

04:27.571 --> 04:28.355
[Zara] Nope!

04:29.225 --> 04:31.575
[tense music]

05:20.537 --> 05:21.843
[Dad] That's your
Mama's coat, isn't it?

05:23.714 --> 05:24.498
Huh.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.457
Are your girls
cold or something?

05:27.501 --> 05:30.591
Actually, I like my
body being covered up.

05:30.634 --> 05:31.418
Thank you.

05:33.376 --> 05:36.858
[Dad] All right,
Zara. [chuckles]

05:36.901 --> 05:39.164
Y'all are in the fancy part
of town, I'll tell you what.

05:39.207 --> 05:40.514
Why don't you hand
out some of these

05:40.557 --> 05:41.602
business cards for
me at the party?

05:42.429 --> 05:43.386
Dad.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.562
Actually, you can
just pull over.

05:45.606 --> 05:46.824
Right here's fine.

05:46.868 --> 05:49.436
[Dad] Mess up this
guy's grass. [laughing]

05:49.479 --> 05:50.480
[Eden] Dad, stop.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.569
Dad, Dad, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.005
-Stop, okay.
-[Dad] I stopped!

05:54.049 --> 05:55.267
[Eden] Thank you.

05:55.311 --> 05:56.530
[Zara] Thanks for
the ride, Mr. Murphy.

05:56.573 --> 05:57.792
[Dad] You're welcome, darling.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.141
Y'all have fun.

06:00.229 --> 06:01.186
[Zara] Okay.

06:01.230 --> 06:02.100
-For you?
-Oh, god.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.101
You actually bought them.

06:03.145 --> 06:04.407
[Eden] Oh, Dad?

06:04.451 --> 06:05.800
Hey, what are you doing?

06:05.843 --> 06:07.192
[Dad groans] I'm just gonna
walk you over there.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.542
[Eden] No, it's okay,
Dad, it's okay, your back.

06:08.585 --> 06:09.978
I don't want you to
strain your back.

06:10.021 --> 06:11.283
[Dad] I want you to be safe.

06:11.327 --> 06:12.415
[Eden] It's okay, it's
just, it's right there.

06:12.459 --> 06:13.460
We'll be fine.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.723
All right, you win.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.770
[Eden] Thank you.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.381
Okay, well, we'll call you.

06:22.643 --> 06:23.426
I know.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.734
'Cause if you don't,
I'm rolling right up

06:26.777 --> 06:29.214
to the front door
in my baby here.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.694
[Eden] God, I hate how
much you love this car.

06:30.738 --> 06:31.739
[Dad laughing]

06:31.782 --> 06:33.436
Okay, we'll call. Bye!

06:34.568 --> 06:37.005
Not as much as I love you.

06:37.788 --> 06:39.050
The wings look good!

06:39.094 --> 06:41.749
-Black is a nice touch.
-Yeah, I like them.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.099
[Zara] So excited, you know?

06:44.142 --> 06:46.449
[Eden] I can hear your sarcasm.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.408
[Zara] I cannot believe
you're making me do this.

06:48.451 --> 06:49.713
[Eden] It's not
gonna be as bad--

06:49.757 --> 06:51.367
I mean, look at them,
they're already leaving.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.412
Clearly it sucks.

06:52.455 --> 06:53.500
[Eden chuckles] No.

06:53.761 --> 06:54.544
-Zara--
-Please.

06:54.588 --> 06:55.806
Come on, Eden, seriously.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.112
Look at this fucking house!

06:57.155 --> 06:58.505
[Eden] Listen to me, okay?

06:58.548 --> 07:00.985
I have a plan, and it's
gonna go so smoothly,

07:01.029 --> 07:04.685
and we'll be super fast, and
if while we're here, you know,

07:04.728 --> 07:05.816
Schroder decides
that we're besties

07:05.860 --> 07:07.427
and he wants to
introduce me to his dad,

07:07.470 --> 07:08.602
and then I get to go
to Penbrook with you,

07:08.645 --> 07:11.039
then all this is worth it.

07:11.082 --> 07:13.694
You really think that
you're gonna become besties

07:13.737 --> 07:15.217
in one fucking night?

07:15.260 --> 07:16.523
Schroder sucks.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.002
-Listen--
-Schroder sucks.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.395
I know he does.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.918
But here's, okay--

07:20.962 --> 07:23.965
Let's maybe not look at how
everybody else is dressed.

07:24.008 --> 07:27.490
No, listen, it's all
gonna work out, okay?

07:27.534 --> 07:28.578
And we're gonna be
roommates next year.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.493
We just have to do this.

07:30.537 --> 07:31.755
It's gonna be great.

07:31.799 --> 07:34.062
I swear I have a plan
and it's gonna be

07:34.105 --> 07:35.542
so quick, and then
we can leave.

07:35.585 --> 07:38.153
[Zara] You're so good at
being so manipulative.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.982
[upbeat music
playing on speakers]

07:43.245 --> 07:44.986
[Zara laughing]

07:45.029 --> 07:45.900
Nope.

07:45.943 --> 07:47.205
No, no, no, please, please.

07:47.249 --> 07:48.511
-Eden.
-Yeah.

07:48.555 --> 07:49.947
We're just gonna be here
for like five minutes.

07:49.991 --> 07:50.731
Okay?

07:50.774 --> 07:51.688
This will be so fast.

07:51.732 --> 07:52.515
Hey, yo.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.345
Phones go in the box.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.564
Why?

07:57.607 --> 08:00.958
Congressman
Schroder lives here.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.612
You really think we'd
be throwing a party?

08:02.656 --> 08:05.354
Here, I'll just, can you put
your phone in there, please?

08:05.397 --> 08:07.008
You coming in or not?

08:07.051 --> 08:08.749
I hate you.

08:08.792 --> 08:09.837
We're gonna get
them back, right?

08:09.880 --> 08:12.622
After the party, smart girls.

08:13.797 --> 08:14.581
Oh, hey.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.365
Okay.

08:19.063 --> 08:20.369
[Zara] I hate it here.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.633
[upbeat music]

09:07.198 --> 09:08.025
[boy laughing]

09:08.069 --> 09:08.939
Let's go.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.203
Okay, I need you to go
get Gooch off the table.

09:12.247 --> 09:13.291
-What?
-Yes.

09:13.335 --> 09:14.597
No, Gooch?

09:14.641 --> 09:16.338
He's like a horny
trust fund baby.

09:16.381 --> 09:17.600
Listen, the sooner you do this,

09:17.644 --> 09:19.863
the sooner we can
go home, okay?

09:19.907 --> 09:21.430
-You promise?
-I promise.

09:21.473 --> 09:22.300
Please?

09:22.344 --> 09:23.563
-Okay.
-Okay.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.131
You got it.

09:27.175 --> 09:28.698
All right.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.918
-It's going right in.
-Sup.

09:36.314 --> 09:37.228
Hi.

09:37.272 --> 09:38.055
Hi.

09:41.537 --> 09:42.320
Yeah, okay.

09:42.364 --> 09:43.147
So um...

09:44.409 --> 09:47.804
Do you wanna make me
a drink or something?

09:49.458 --> 09:51.025
-What do I do?
-Go.

09:54.768 --> 09:55.551
Yeah.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.465
Yeah. [chuckling]

09:56.508 --> 09:58.162
-Totally.
-Great, okay.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.862
Alright, I guess it's just
me against you two.

10:01.905 --> 10:05.430
Whoa, looks like you
could use a partner.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.912
Un-fucking-believable.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.312
So, you play the cello, right?

10:18.879 --> 10:21.621
It's called an oboe.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.797
What the fuck do
you do with an oboe?

10:24.928 --> 10:26.190
Get a full ride to Penbrook.

10:26.234 --> 10:27.757
What?!

10:27.801 --> 10:28.845
Wow!

10:28.889 --> 10:30.542
Well, I realize
that it's the least

10:30.586 --> 10:32.936
competitive scholarship
for ivy league schools.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.852
And nobody, obviously,
plays the oboe, so.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.812
But now you're like going
for free though, right?

10:38.855 --> 10:40.727
-Yeah.
-It's like...

10:41.858 --> 10:44.426
Really fucking smart.

10:44.469 --> 10:45.645
I am fucking smart.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.342
[both chuckling]

10:47.385 --> 10:49.823
Only way I'm getting into
college is if my dad donates

10:49.866 --> 10:53.783
like a million dollars,
which is not gonna happen.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.658
'Cause he calls me
his little fuck-up.

11:01.965 --> 11:05.665
So what are you making
over there, hmm?

11:05.708 --> 11:07.101
Yes, this.

11:07.144 --> 11:11.018
It is a gift for your
tongue, for your taste buds.

11:12.019 --> 11:13.542
Sorry, I'm sorry.

11:14.935 --> 11:15.718
For you.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.204
Oh fuck.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.771
-Good fuck?
-Yeah, actually.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.729
Actually It's
like really good.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.513
-You like it?
-Yeah.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.212
Is this gonna get me
fucked up, though?

11:31.255 --> 11:33.736
[both laughing]

11:33.780 --> 11:34.824
[Girl] Have you
seen my sister?

11:34.868 --> 11:37.914
Has anybody see my sister?!

11:37.958 --> 11:39.960
Did you see her?

11:40.003 --> 11:41.831
-You're a liar.
-I just told you I didn't.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.441
You're all liars!

11:43.485 --> 11:45.356
[Girl screaming]

11:45.400 --> 11:47.707
[tense music]

11:54.844 --> 11:58.152
-Is that Melissa's sister?
-You know where she is?

11:58.195 --> 11:58.935
Yeah.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.026
What about you?

12:04.898 --> 12:06.595
Have you seen my sister?

12:06.638 --> 12:08.553
[Party girl] This is not a
good luck, sweetie.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.773
-My god, shut up.
-Oh, fuck!

12:10.817 --> 12:12.122
Hey, all right, all right.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.689
Come on, it's a party!

12:13.733 --> 12:15.430
Get her outta here.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.345
No, get your hands off me.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.739
[tense music]

12:24.831 --> 12:27.964
[girl laughs]

12:28.008 --> 12:30.793
One of you knows something.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.621
I'm not leaving here
until I find out

12:32.664 --> 12:36.320
-where the fuck my sister is!
-That didn't fucking work.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.278
You got that?!

12:37.321 --> 12:38.583
-Yo.
-No, no, don't touch me.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.281
Just go take care
of this bitch okay?

12:40.324 --> 12:42.674
I'll drive her home.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.198
I'll take her home.

12:46.722 --> 12:47.984
It's in the garage.

12:48.028 --> 12:48.811
Okay.

12:48.855 --> 12:49.943
I'll be back.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.730
[Zara] You okay?

12:54.774 --> 12:55.513
Mm-hmm.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.132
Tanya, you're home.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.232
My sister used to do this.

13:22.497 --> 13:25.413
[knocking on door]

13:25.456 --> 13:26.544
Tanya.

13:26.588 --> 13:29.852
-Are you okay, honey?
-I'm fine, Dad.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.898
Let's just get you
in the house.

13:31.941 --> 13:34.596
-Look, I was worried to death.
-I'm okay.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.207
[pensive music]

13:52.962 --> 13:54.616
[horn honking]

13:54.659 --> 13:55.965
[Eden] Jesus.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.839
[Shroder] Thinking
of stealing it?

14:01.579 --> 14:04.060
[garage door whirring]

14:10.850 --> 14:13.026
Let me show you something.

14:13.983 --> 14:16.768
That's what I gotta live up to.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.902
If I don't become
president, I'll basically

14:19.946 --> 14:22.252
be considered a fuck-up.

14:22.296 --> 14:25.168
Well, just become
president then, right?

14:25.212 --> 14:26.909
Can't be that hard.

14:28.911 --> 14:29.694
Okay.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.785
Ah, you're killing me.

14:33.829 --> 14:34.874
Killing me.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.444
When my family
first landed here,

14:40.488 --> 14:41.793
a native chief gave that to my

14:41.837 --> 14:44.187
great-great-great grandfather.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.149
Right.

14:54.981 --> 14:55.764
See this?

14:59.115 --> 15:02.466
My great grandfather stole
this from a German soldier

15:02.510 --> 15:04.729
he killed in World War II.

15:05.817 --> 15:06.818
Still works.

15:08.472 --> 15:09.778
Wanna hold it?

15:09.821 --> 15:14.000
Schroder, so, you know,
speaking of your family.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.350
Mm-hmm.

15:16.393 --> 15:20.310
What do you think about
introducing me to your dad?

15:23.009 --> 15:23.835
My dad?

15:26.186 --> 15:30.103
You're really determined
to use me, aren't you?

15:36.022 --> 15:36.848
Hmm.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.160
What's your pitch?

15:48.121 --> 15:50.514
Penbrook has been
my dream school

15:50.558 --> 15:53.169
for as long as I can remember,

15:54.388 --> 15:55.998
and not a single other
person in my family

15:56.042 --> 15:57.695
has gone to college.

15:57.739 --> 15:59.654
I mean, I've had no help.

15:59.697 --> 16:00.960
I don't come from money.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.005
I haven't had any tutors.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.181
I couldn't afford SAT prep.

16:05.225 --> 16:09.011
I mean, Schroder, I
have done all of this

16:09.055 --> 16:11.057
completely on my own,
and I'm just wait-listed.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.145
And if I could just
talk to your dad.

16:12.188 --> 16:15.104
[Shroder slow-clapping]

16:17.933 --> 16:19.413
That's wonderful.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.111
But it's also a lie.

16:23.373 --> 16:26.028
You said you've done it
completely on your own,

16:26.072 --> 16:28.204
If I did hear correctly,
and that's not true.

16:28.248 --> 16:30.685
'cause now you need my help.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.036
If I could just
talk to your dad.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.647
[ominous music]

16:59.105 --> 17:00.715
Where are you going?

17:01.716 --> 17:03.326
We're still on the
table, partner.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.157
[Shroder] All right, you guys
ready to get fucked?

17:09.202 --> 17:10.246
[Horned player] All day, bro.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.682
All day, let's go.

17:11.726 --> 17:14.076
Don't miss, no pressure.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.598
Oh!

17:15.643 --> 17:17.165
Okay, okay.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.906
Hey, you got it, you got it.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.082
All right.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.214
All you, bro.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.564
Well, you know, it was...

17:23.607 --> 17:27.262
[Zara shouting indistinctly]

17:29.222 --> 17:31.267
Fuck your fucking game.

17:31.311 --> 17:32.834
-[Zara] Demon little whores.
-Okay.

17:32.877 --> 17:33.965
Ok, Zara, jeez.

17:34.009 --> 17:35.271
-Hey!
-Hey.

17:35.315 --> 17:36.142
Hey, what's up?

17:36.185 --> 17:37.143
Are you drunk?

17:38.231 --> 17:39.362
No.

17:39.406 --> 17:42.278
I just had a little one.

17:42.322 --> 17:43.453
Hey, Eden?

17:43.497 --> 17:45.281
Can we go home now?

17:45.325 --> 17:48.241
Yes, we are gonna
go home so soon.

17:48.284 --> 17:49.677
People are gross here.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.418
They are, I know.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.811
Can we pause the game
for just two minutes?

17:53.855 --> 17:55.161
-Two minutes.
-You look naked!

17:55.204 --> 17:56.292
-Come on.
-All right.

17:56.336 --> 17:57.467
You got two minutes.

17:57.511 --> 17:58.251
Otherwise I'm getting
another partner.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.991
Okay, that's fine.

18:00.035 --> 18:01.297
Okay, I'll be right there.

18:01.341 --> 18:02.385
[Zara] Bye.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.954
[Zara] Joel, I'm coming for you.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.390
-[Eden] No, no, no.
-[Zara] What?

18:07.434 --> 18:09.175
[Eden] No, we're just gonna
take a nap really fast.

18:09.218 --> 18:10.350
[Zara] Up here?

18:10.393 --> 18:11.873
[Eden] And then we're
gonna go home.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.092
Yeah?

18:13.135 --> 18:15.006
-Oh, look at those douches.
-Okay.

18:15.050 --> 18:17.096
-Douche!
-Oh, God, Zara.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.749
-Douche!
-No, Zara.

18:18.793 --> 18:19.533
You're good.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.535
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.537
-He's looking at me.
-Okay, come here.

18:23.580 --> 18:24.929
Give me your hand.

-Ooh.
-Come on.

18:31.414 --> 18:32.589
Watch yourself.

18:32.633 --> 18:33.938

you get your phones?

Come on.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.563
Let's get you to bed.

18:50.825 --> 18:54.742
I don't want a roommate
who eats my toothbrush.

18:55.525 --> 18:56.874
I want you.

18:56.918 --> 18:59.355

I'm working on, okay?

What are you doing in here?

21:17.537 --> 21:18.712

-[Kendra] Shit!

24:04.617 --> 24:07.315
[teens laughing]

24:08.751 --> 24:10.231
[Gooch] You all right?

24:10.274 --> 24:11.711
Can I go home?

24:11.754 --> 24:13.364
[Gooch] Oh, that's not
my call, sorry.

24:13.582 --> 24:15.149
To the coolest
people in school.

24:15.192 --> 24:17.891
The coolest, the coolest.

24:17.934 --> 24:20.154
Why the fuck did you
throw that out?

24:21.068 --> 24:22.417
[Shroder] You wanna go home?

24:22.461 --> 24:24.506
You're not going
fucking home, okay?

24:24.550 --> 24:27.204
[tense music]

24:31.121 --> 24:32.427
-[Melissa] Just gonna go.
-[Shroder] Oh, you're gonna go?

24:32.471 --> 24:33.472
-Yeah.
-Why are you going?

24:34.951 --> 24:35.474
Why would you not
wanna hang out with us?

24:35.517 --> 24:37.563
[tense music]

24:38.738 --> 24:39.826
Get in the car.

24:41.175 --> 24:42.959
Get in the car.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.570
We gotta take her home, so
we're gonna go take her home.

24:44.613 --> 24:46.702
[Shroder] Get in the car.

24:46.746 --> 24:49.400
[tense music]

25:01.717 --> 25:02.979
Oh, shit.

25:03.023 --> 25:03.806
Shit.

25:05.460 --> 25:06.243
Hey, Zara.

25:08.245 --> 25:09.812
Hey, Zara, I need
you to get up.

25:09.856 --> 25:12.598
I need you to get up and help
me find a charger, please?

25:12.641 --> 25:13.686
Zara.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.604
[tense music]

25:33.923 --> 25:34.924
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:36.578 --> 25:38.580
Mind if we come in?

25:38.624 --> 25:40.800
Zara actually
isn't feeling good,

25:40.843 --> 25:43.454
so I don't think she'd like
people to see her like this.

25:43.498 --> 25:44.717
Right.

25:44.760 --> 25:45.587
Yeah.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.592
Well, Gooch forgot something,

25:50.636 --> 25:52.681
so if we could just come in.

25:52.725 --> 25:53.943
What'd you forget, Gooch?

25:54.814 --> 25:56.642
Like, I left in...

26:00.559 --> 26:01.951
His phone.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.431
[Shroder] He left
his phone in there.

26:03.474 --> 26:04.737
Just trying to get it.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.608
[Eden] Got it, okay.

26:06.652 --> 26:07.827
I actually think I saw it.

26:07.870 --> 26:08.828
I'll just grab
it really quick.

26:08.871 --> 26:09.742
[Shroder] No, that's fine.

26:09.785 --> 26:10.481
No, I'll bring it to you guys.

26:10.525 --> 26:11.308
It's fine.

26:14.442 --> 26:16.531
[lock clicking]

26:16.575 --> 26:18.925
She locked the door.

26:18.968 --> 26:21.797
[door rattling]

26:29.065 --> 26:31.111
[Shroder] Shit, shit, shit!

26:31.154 --> 26:32.765
[Kendra] Will you calm down?

26:32.808 --> 26:34.418
It's not like she's
got the passcode.

26:35.855 --> 26:38.640
[Gooch chuckling nervously]

26:46.909 --> 26:48.868
I don't have a passcode.

26:48.911 --> 26:50.304
What the hell is
wrong with you?

26:50.347 --> 26:51.653
You're fucking killing me.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.046
I kept forgetting it, guys.

26:53.089 --> 26:56.397
Who the fuck doesn't
have a passcode?

27:04.666 --> 27:05.449
[Shroder] Eden.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.365
You okay in there?

27:09.540 --> 27:11.499
Yeah, yeah, I'm
just helping Zara.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.066
Sorry, just gimme a second.

27:13.109 --> 27:16.765
How about I come in there
and grab the phone, okay?

27:16.809 --> 27:19.855
Schroder, do your parents
have a charger in here?

27:30.997 --> 27:32.738
Did the phone die or something?

27:32.781 --> 27:34.217
I just wanna charge
it up so I can

27:34.261 --> 27:35.915
call my dad to
come pick us up.

27:35.958 --> 27:37.090
Yes.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.570
Yes, I think that's
a wonderful idea.

27:39.614 --> 27:41.224
Come on out, we'll
give you your phone

27:41.268 --> 27:43.357
so you can call your dad.

27:43.400 --> 27:46.055
I don't wanna leave
Zara in here by herself,

27:46.099 --> 27:47.491
so why don't you just

27:47.535 --> 27:49.580
give me the phone charger
under the door.

27:49.624 --> 27:52.061
I can help.
Let me help.

27:52.105 --> 27:53.889
-I can help.
-No.

27:53.933 --> 27:56.283
I think you've done enough.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.590
[Schroder clears throat]

27:59.634 --> 28:00.983
Yeah, that'd be a little
weird though, right?

28:01.027 --> 28:03.116
To give you a charger
when you could just

28:03.159 --> 28:05.640
come out here and
get your phone.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.772
Schroder, I saw the video.

28:07.990 --> 28:10.645
[tense music]

28:16.999 --> 28:17.739
What?

28:17.783 --> 28:18.827
Stop.

28:20.089 --> 28:20.873
Stop.

28:23.005 --> 28:23.745
Come on now.

28:26.226 --> 28:27.749
Mm.

28:27.793 --> 28:28.619
What, uh...

28:29.708 --> 28:30.578
What video?

28:31.797 --> 28:34.713
I saw you with
Melissa on Friday.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.324
I thought you said
the phone died.

28:37.367 --> 28:38.629
It did.

28:38.673 --> 28:39.805
So you didn't see
the whole video.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.807
I saw enough of it.

28:43.722 --> 28:44.810
Schroder, where is she?

28:47.595 --> 28:50.903
The last time that
we saw Melissa Brown

28:53.383 --> 28:55.908
is when we dropped
her off at her house.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.257
I swear to God.

28:58.780 --> 29:02.001
Okay, if that's the truth,
then give me a charger

29:02.044 --> 29:03.567
and let me finish
watching the video.

29:03.611 --> 29:06.353
I'm not sliding a charger
under the door, even though--

29:06.396 --> 29:08.877
I'm not leaving this
room until you give me

29:08.921 --> 29:11.793
a charger and I finish
watching the video.

29:11.837 --> 29:14.535
I think you're gonna think
this is all really silly

29:14.578 --> 29:16.798
once you see this video.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.931
Why don't you come on out?

29:18.974 --> 29:22.586
Charge up the phone,
give you your phone,

29:22.630 --> 29:27.113
and then we'll all watch
the video together, okay?

29:27.156 --> 29:28.375
How does that sound, Eden?

29:28.418 --> 29:29.593
Is that good for you?

29:29.637 --> 29:30.812
You wanna be reasonable,
give me a charger

29:30.856 --> 29:35.077
in the next 30 seconds
or I'm gonna scream.

29:35.121 --> 29:35.904
30.

29:37.776 --> 29:38.864

29:38.907 --> 29:41.083
-What we fucking doing, man?
-28.

30:23.082 --> 30:24.997
Zara, come on, I
need you to wake up.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.999
Please, Zara, please wake up.

30:27.042 --> 30:27.913
Get the fuck outta here!

30:27.956 --> 30:30.176

30:32.569 --> 30:33.832
Zara, come on.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.921
Come on, I need you to wake up.

33:51.507 --> 33:53.988
[Shroder] Keep your
fucking voice down.

33:55.424 --> 33:57.774
Look what you've done.

33:57.818 --> 34:00.038
Look what you've done, Gooch.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.215
Go downstairs.

34:03.258 --> 34:04.781
Get cleaned up, now.

34:06.174 --> 34:09.090
'Cause you wanna help, right?

34:09.134 --> 34:10.873
You wanna help?

34:10.918 --> 34:12.833
Then fucking go!

34:12.876 --> 34:13.659

Is this really
your smartest idea?

35:13.111 --> 35:14.199
Good point.

35:15.287 --> 35:16.114
You do it.

35:17.245 --> 35:18.333
No way.

35:18.377 --> 35:20.335
I hurt my shoulder, I'm done.

35:20.379 --> 35:21.597
Oh, Kendra,

35:21.641 --> 35:24.731
you'd like, perpetrate
this door like so easy.

35:27.386 --> 35:29.301
Of course I could.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.955
But I'm not risking my athletic
career for this bullshit.

35:31.999 --> 35:33.479
[Shroder] Athletic career?

35:33.522 --> 35:36.221
Let's be clear on
something, all right?

35:36.264 --> 35:39.572
No one's gonna remember shit
about either one of you two

35:39.615 --> 35:41.487
if they see this video.

35:43.010 --> 35:47.580
If they see this video, it's
fucking over, all right?

35:47.623 --> 35:50.626
Get up and knock this
fucking door down.

No, man, I'm pretty
fucked up, I can't.

your father's face...

When he finds out that
you're part of all of this.

36:07.904 --> 36:11.430
Think about how disappointed

36:11.473 --> 36:14.868
he's going to be
when he realizes

36:14.911 --> 36:16.086
he was right.

36:16.957 --> 36:17.740
Oh.

around, all right?

37:13.622 --> 37:16.277
I need you to get the ladder
and get the phone, okay?

37:16.321 --> 37:17.191

on that, dude, like,

really expensive.

49:43.067 --> 49:45.199
What's your passcode?

49:45.243 --> 49:47.419
Five-eight, oh-two

49:55.731 --> 49:58.256
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

49:58.299 --> 50:01.955
Eden, I can't, I'm
sorry, I can't, I can't.

50:01.999 --> 50:03.783
[Zara crying]

50:03.826 --> 50:06.829
[suspenseful music]

50:14.489 --> 50:15.273
Eden!

50:17.536 --> 50:18.319
Eden!

50:25.631 --> 50:27.502
I got you, I got you!

50:39.123 --> 50:42.169
[girls panting]

50:42.213 --> 50:43.127
[Zara] Where you going?

50:43.170 --> 50:44.128
We're going the wrong way.

50:44.171 --> 50:46.260
You're going the, fuck, oh god.

50:46.304 --> 50:47.696
No, no, no, no.

50:47.740 --> 50:50.612
[Kendra talking indistinctly]

50:50.656 --> 50:53.398
[Kendra shouting]

50:56.096 --> 50:56.966
Schroder.

50:57.010 --> 50:57.880
Get my phone. Get my phone.

50:57.924 --> 50:59.317
-No.
-We gotta call someone.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.144
We're not getting your phone.

51:00.187 --> 51:01.754
We're not calling anyone.

51:01.797 --> 51:03.103
We're not calling anyone until
we can Gooch's phone, okay?

51:03.147 --> 51:05.018
Fuck the phone, man!

51:05.062 --> 51:06.324
Do you see me?

51:06.367 --> 51:08.195
-You fucking see me?
-Shh.

51:08.239 --> 51:09.022
[Shroder] Okay, look--

51:09.066 --> 51:10.676
[Kendra groaning]

51:10.719 --> 51:12.156
I'm gonna fucking die.

51:12.199 --> 51:13.679
[Schroder] Here, here.

51:13.722 --> 51:15.898
That's not gonna do shit.

51:15.942 --> 51:17.813
No, hold it there,
hold it there.

51:17.857 --> 51:18.553
[Kendra] I'm gonna die.

51:18.597 --> 51:19.598
You're not gonna die.

51:20.294 --> 51:21.339
[Kendra] I don't
want your pills.

51:21.382 --> 51:22.209
[Shroder] You're
in a lot of pain,

51:22.253 --> 51:23.471
this is gonna help you, okay?

51:23.515 --> 51:24.342
[Kendra] I don't want
your fucking pills.

51:24.733 --> 51:25.604
God dammit.

51:27.214 --> 51:30.130
[Kendra mumbling]

51:30.174 --> 51:33.177
I don't want your pills,
man, I don't want your pills.

51:33.220 --> 51:36.267
Fucking-- I don't
want your pills.

51:37.485 --> 51:38.356
[sobbing] Look at me.

51:39.270 --> 51:40.488
I'm gonna die.

51:42.099 --> 51:44.144
After all we've been through
you can't leave me like this.

51:44.188 --> 51:46.320
You can't leave me like
this, you're my best friend.

51:46.364 --> 51:47.104
Please.

51:48.409 --> 51:51.282
-Stop fucking crying, okay!
-Fuck off!

51:51.325 --> 51:52.326
Oh, shit!

51:53.893 --> 51:54.894
[Kendra crying]

51:54.937 --> 51:57.679
[Kendra mumbling]

51:58.854 --> 52:00.247
-Fuck!
-[pills clattering]

52:00.291 --> 52:02.206
[Kendra] You can't
leave me, man.

52:02.249 --> 52:03.859
I'm gonna die.

52:03.903 --> 52:06.471
[Kendra crying]

52:17.699 --> 52:20.006
You're my best friend, man.

52:22.400 --> 52:24.228
I have to get that phone.

52:24.271 --> 52:26.230
No, fuck the phone.

52:28.101 --> 52:28.884
No, no.

52:30.538 --> 52:31.626
Oh, fuck.

52:31.670 --> 52:33.672
You can't leave me, you can't.

52:33.715 --> 52:35.239
No, Schro, Schro!

52:37.066 --> 52:39.852
[Kendra mumbling]

52:41.419 --> 52:42.159
Best friend.

52:44.552 --> 52:46.380
And then the phone died.

52:48.426 --> 52:52.821
So all you saw was Melissa
getting in Schroder's car.

52:52.865 --> 52:55.607
Zara, are you not listening?

52:55.650 --> 52:58.740
They were with her the
night that she disappeared.

52:58.784 --> 52:59.611
So?

52:59.654 --> 53:02.222
That doesn't prove anything.

53:02.266 --> 53:03.745
It proves that they
lied to the cops

53:03.789 --> 53:06.183
and that they
know where she is.

53:06.226 --> 53:07.271
You don't know that for sure.

53:07.314 --> 53:08.359
My god.

53:10.099 --> 53:11.666
-Are you serious?
-Look.

53:11.710 --> 53:13.364
If this is what
you think it is,

53:13.407 --> 53:15.496
we're not getting out until
we give them that phone.

53:15.540 --> 53:16.802
I know.

53:16.845 --> 53:18.282
That's why this is
going to the police.

53:18.325 --> 53:20.980
No, we have to give
it back to them.

53:21.023 --> 53:22.634
Look, we can tell
the police ourselves,

53:22.677 --> 53:25.680
but right now we need to
get the fuck out of here.

53:25.724 --> 53:28.640
Zara, his dad is
a congressman.

53:28.683 --> 53:29.684
[Zara] So?

53:29.728 --> 53:30.511
So?

53:31.730 --> 53:34.254
Can you think about
that, for a second?

53:34.298 --> 53:35.168
Who are we?

53:36.691 --> 53:39.868
You really think anyone's
gonna believe us over them?

53:39.912 --> 53:42.349
This is the only chance
we have to help find her.

53:42.393 --> 53:44.003
We have to take
this to the police.

53:44.046 --> 53:44.830
Eden.

53:45.918 --> 53:47.311
Give me the phone.

53:48.921 --> 53:49.661
[scoffs]

53:52.316 --> 53:53.665
Give me the phone.

53:56.885 --> 53:57.669
No.

54:00.062 --> 54:01.150
-No!
-Give me the phone!

54:01.194 --> 54:02.500
-Zara!
-Give me the phone!

54:02.543 --> 54:03.414
Zara!

54:03.457 --> 54:07.374
[girls shouting indistinctly]

54:12.814 --> 54:15.730
[insects chirping]

54:18.429 --> 54:22.259
[girls shouting indistinctly]

54:23.521 --> 54:26.393
[insects chirping]

54:42.191 --> 54:46.544
[girls shouting indistinctly]

54:46.587 --> 54:49.503
[insects chirping]

54:59.600 --> 55:00.340
Hello?

55:03.691 --> 55:05.171
-Zara.
-Let go!

55:05.214 --> 55:06.303
Fuck, Zara.

55:07.260 --> 55:08.087
No!

55:08.130 --> 55:08.870
Zara.

55:08.914 --> 55:09.697
Ow!

55:21.883 --> 55:22.667
Eden?

55:24.016 --> 55:25.234
[girls grunting]

55:25.278 --> 55:26.497
Please, Zara!

55:26.540 --> 55:28.020
Eden, stop!

55:28.063 --> 55:30.979
[insects chirping]

55:37.508 --> 55:38.465
Give it to me!

55:51.565 --> 55:52.349
Eden!

55:55.526 --> 55:58.442
You up there, sweetheart?

55:58.485 --> 55:59.312
Fuck!

56:00.574 --> 56:01.358
Please.

56:02.663 --> 56:04.404
Zara, please, that is
the only proof we have.

56:04.448 --> 56:06.275
I don't care about proof.

56:06.319 --> 56:07.451
I wanna go home!

56:08.930 --> 56:10.062
[Dad] Eden?

56:14.501 --> 56:15.546
Dad?

56:17.199 --> 56:18.462
Is that you, sweetheart?

56:18.505 --> 56:20.768
Oh my god, Dad, what
are you doing here?

56:20.812 --> 56:22.857
What the hell happened here?

56:22.901 --> 56:25.425
-[suspenseful music]
-[Eden screaming]

56:25.469 --> 56:26.470
No!

56:26.513 --> 56:27.514
No!

56:27.558 --> 56:28.559
Eden, run!

56:31.475 --> 56:33.520
-No!
-[clattering]

56:36.523 --> 56:38.307
Get the fuck off me.

56:38.351 --> 56:39.134
It's over!

56:40.048 --> 56:42.529
Now it's my turn to count.

56:42.573 --> 56:45.663
You've got 10 seconds to
give me back that phone.

56:45.706 --> 56:46.925
Schroder, stop!

56:46.968 --> 56:49.841
I split your daddy's
head wide open!

56:49.884 --> 56:50.668
Ten!

56:52.539 --> 56:53.888
Nine!

56:53.932 --> 56:56.238
Sweetheart, just give
him his phone, all right?

56:56.282 --> 56:57.370
Eight!

56:57.414 --> 56:58.806
-[Zara] Stop, stop, stop!
-Seven!

56:58.850 --> 57:00.634
I have it, Schroder!

57:01.505 --> 57:02.984
Bring it to me.

57:05.073 --> 57:05.857
[Shroder] Now!

57:06.684 --> 57:07.685
Six!

57:07.728 --> 57:09.164
-[Zara] Got it!
-Five!

57:11.515 --> 57:14.474
[suspenseful music continues]

57:28.053 --> 57:29.489
Fuck.

57:29.533 --> 57:30.359
You.

57:33.537 --> 57:37.541
You know, Eden, I don't
think I'm gonna invite you

57:37.584 --> 57:39.543
to any more of my parties.

57:43.068 --> 57:44.635
[man] Barrett Theodore Schroder.

57:46.245 --> 57:49.074
-What's going on here?
-[Shroder] Dad.

57:49.117 --> 57:51.729
I didn't think you were
gonna be home until Sunday.

57:51.772 --> 57:53.557
Well, your mother
wasn't feeling well.

57:53.600 --> 57:56.081
You need to explain everything
that's happening now.

57:56.124 --> 57:56.864
Right now.

57:56.908 --> 57:58.126
Yes.

57:58.170 --> 58:00.738
Well, you see, me and
some of my friends

58:00.781 --> 58:02.740
were just having
little get-together,

58:02.783 --> 58:05.830
and things got out of
hand, but I've got it all

58:05.873 --> 58:07.614
under control now,
everything's cool,

58:07.658 --> 58:09.007
it's all cool,
everything's cool.

58:09.050 --> 58:11.270
No, everything is definitely
not cool, young man.

58:44.259 --> 58:47.567
I just think we all need
to take a deep breath.

58:47.611 --> 58:49.961
Are you fucking shitting me?

59:00.537 --> 59:01.276
It's her fault.

59:01.320 --> 59:02.277
She started all of this.

59:02.321 --> 59:04.366
She stole Gooch's phone and...

59:04.410 --> 59:05.280
Her fault?

59:05.324 --> 59:06.717
-Her fault?
-[Shroder] Yes.

59:06.760 --> 59:08.414
When I walked into
this mad house,

59:08.457 --> 59:10.285
you were chasing my
daughter around with an ax!

59:10.329 --> 59:11.765
Mr. Murphy.

59:11.809 --> 59:15.160
I'm happy we have this
opportunity to talk this over.

59:15.203 --> 59:16.335
[Joel] Talk?

59:16.378 --> 59:18.163
You better start
explaining a few things,

59:18.206 --> 59:20.600
or I'm gonna go talk
to the cops, all right?

59:20.644 --> 59:23.821
Oh. [laughing]

59:23.864 --> 59:25.083
Not necessary.

59:25.126 --> 59:27.215
How did this get so out
of control, Barrett?

59:27.259 --> 59:28.826
I was just trying to
protect you, that's all.

59:28.869 --> 59:30.654
I know this is a big year with
the election and everything,

59:30.697 --> 59:32.220
and I just didn't--

59:32.264 --> 59:35.615
The only person he's been
trying to protect is himself.

59:35.659 --> 59:37.486
I've seen the video.

59:37.530 --> 59:38.879
Dad, don't listen to her--

59:38.923 --> 59:40.794
[Eden] Did you know he has
a video on his phone?

59:40.838 --> 59:42.056
[Shroder] Dad--

59:42.100 --> 59:43.405
Of Melissa Brown being
forced into his car

59:43.449 --> 59:45.451
the night that
she disappeared?

59:45.494 --> 59:46.974
[Joel] Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:47.018 --> 59:48.802
What's this got
to do with that?

59:48.846 --> 59:50.108
What?

59:50.151 --> 59:52.545
Gooch, Gooch, come on,
talk to my parents.

59:52.589 --> 59:54.068
Tell them the truth.
You know what happened.

59:54.112 --> 59:56.114
[Eden] What happened, Schroder?

59:56.941 --> 59:57.942
[Shroder] Tell them.

59:59.117 --> 01:00:00.814
It is your phone, Gooch.

01:00:00.858 --> 01:00:02.033
Gooch?

01:00:02.076 --> 01:00:02.773
Why don't you just
tell us what's on it?

01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:03.861
Why don't you?

01:00:05.776 --> 01:00:06.777
[Shroder] Tell them.

01:00:07.865 --> 01:00:09.257
Fucking tell them.

01:00:11.346 --> 01:00:12.783
Fucking pussy, goddamn.

01:00:12.826 --> 01:00:15.046
Why don't you find
a charger for that?

01:00:15.089 --> 01:00:18.049
Watch the video yourselves.

01:00:18.092 --> 01:00:20.138
Good luck getting
into Penbrook, bitch.

01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:21.618
[Astrid] Oh, excuse me?

01:00:22.531 --> 01:00:23.402
-Did you-
-Barrett.

01:00:23.445 --> 01:00:24.533
Excuse me?

01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:25.926
Did you not hear him?

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:27.841
He said, "good luck getting
into Penbrook, bitch."

01:00:27.885 --> 01:00:30.061
Okay, well that's not the
way we're raising this house,

01:00:30.104 --> 01:00:31.236
is it, Barrett?!

01:00:31.279 --> 01:00:32.803
You respect women in this house.

01:00:32.846 --> 01:00:34.631
You have to apologize.

01:00:35.849 --> 01:00:36.850
Apologize?

01:00:37.764 --> 01:00:38.765
For what?

01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:39.679
[Astrid] Apologize!

01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:40.724
Barrett.

01:00:41.942 --> 01:00:43.074
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:00:43.944 --> 01:00:45.859
Not to me, asshole.

01:00:49.297 --> 01:00:50.864
I'm sorry, Eden.

01:00:52.779 --> 01:00:55.303
-[Astrid] Thank you.
-Un-fucking-believable.

01:00:55.347 --> 01:00:56.696
Excuse me.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:57.523
So.

01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:00.700
What exactly did you see, Eden?

01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:01.745
She didn't see shit.

01:01:01.788 --> 01:01:03.398
I saw enough to
know that your son

01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:06.488
and Gooch and Kendra are
hiding something massive.

01:01:06.532 --> 01:01:07.533
Oh.

01:01:07.576 --> 01:01:08.839
[Shroder] Hiding
something massive.

01:01:08.882 --> 01:01:09.666
And uh...

01:01:12.233 --> 01:01:13.670
Where is Kendra?

01:01:20.764 --> 01:01:21.590
Kendra.

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:24.637
Kendra!

01:01:26.073 --> 01:01:26.813
No.

01:01:26.857 --> 01:01:27.901
Hey.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.820
[Congressman] Son.

01:01:33.864 --> 01:01:34.908
What?

01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:39.521
-Dad?
-I'm here.

01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:44.918
[Schroder] Let's call
her an ambulance.

01:01:44.962 --> 01:01:46.790
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:48.922
[Schroder mumbling]

01:01:48.966 --> 01:01:50.402
[Schroder] Need to
call an ambulance.

01:01:50.445 --> 01:01:52.578
[Congressman] Will you
say something to your son?

01:01:52.621 --> 01:01:55.450
What do you want me to say?

01:01:55.494 --> 01:01:56.843
Do you want me to say
it's all gonna be okay?

01:01:56.887 --> 01:02:00.412
That this little mess
up of his is acceptable?

01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:01.979
Did you want me to
feel sorry for him?

01:02:02.022 --> 01:02:04.285
I just want you tell
me how to fix it.

01:02:04.329 --> 01:02:05.678
You amaze me.

01:02:07.636 --> 01:02:10.248
After all these years, you
still haven't figured it out.

01:02:10.291 --> 01:02:12.337
No matter what anybody says,
they're only going to do

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.078
what's best for them.

01:02:18.865 --> 01:02:19.910
Not this one.

01:02:20.998 --> 01:02:21.868
She's different.

01:02:21.912 --> 01:02:24.044
Nah, you just think she is.

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:27.004
Hmm.

01:02:43.498 --> 01:02:46.763
[quiet sobbing]

01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:05.999
Darling, thank you.

01:03:07.696 --> 01:03:10.482
I'd like to begin by
apologizing to each of you

01:03:10.525 --> 01:03:14.094
for everything that my
son did this evening.

01:03:16.227 --> 01:03:18.359
Barrett knows better. I
don't know quite how

01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:20.057
everything got
so out of control.

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.973
That is not how our
family handles things.

01:03:24.235 --> 01:03:25.236
Thank you.

01:03:29.414 --> 01:03:30.937
Mr. Murphy.

01:03:30.981 --> 01:03:33.592
You own a a septic
tank company?

01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:36.073
Yeah.

01:03:36.116 --> 01:03:37.161
Is that a good--

01:03:37.204 --> 01:03:38.902
well sure it is,
everybody shits.

01:03:38.945 --> 01:03:42.383
Do you know, the county
is accepting bids

01:03:42.427 --> 01:03:44.211
for the new
municipal contracts.

01:03:44.255 --> 01:03:45.865
I think in order to make
amends for this evening,

01:03:45.909 --> 01:03:47.345
my husband would be
more than willing

01:03:47.388 --> 01:03:49.477
to talk to his
friends on the board,

01:03:49.521 --> 01:03:52.480
if that's something that
you would be interested in?

01:03:52.524 --> 01:03:54.047
And do I understand
that you have

01:03:54.091 --> 01:03:55.962
a scholarship to
Penbrook in the fall?

01:03:56.006 --> 01:03:58.008
Well, that's impressive.

01:03:59.444 --> 01:04:01.533
Unfortunately, a lot
of those scholarships

01:04:01.576 --> 01:04:03.361
don't cover all the costs.

01:04:03.404 --> 01:04:04.710
[Astrid] Oh.

01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:06.538
Oh my husband and
I love supporting

01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:08.627
underprivileged students.

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:10.411
So this might help me
feel like you're on

01:04:10.455 --> 01:04:13.850
a little more equal footing
with the other students

01:04:13.893 --> 01:04:15.416
next year.

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.983
[Congressman] And that way you
can focus on your studies

01:04:17.027 --> 01:04:20.030
instead of all these annoying
financial distractions.

01:04:20.073 --> 01:04:20.987
[Astrid] Ah, true.

01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:25.949
-[Zara] Oh.
-I know.

01:04:27.951 --> 01:04:29.953
[Astrid] Yeah.

01:04:30.954 --> 01:04:31.998
[Congressman] Yeah.

01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:33.086
-[Astrid] Huh.
-[Congressman] Yeah.

01:04:39.353 --> 01:04:41.225
You can't just buy us off.

01:04:41.268 --> 01:04:43.009
Oh, well. I think we just--

01:04:43.053 --> 01:04:44.228
We're not doing that at all.

01:04:44.271 --> 01:04:45.925
The character that
you've shown tonight

01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:48.101
is just express that
you are the exact kind

01:04:48.145 --> 01:04:52.018
of bright young woman
that belongs at Penbrook.

01:04:52.062 --> 01:04:53.063
Oh, yes.

01:04:53.106 --> 01:04:54.455
If you wanted to
go to that school,

01:04:54.499 --> 01:04:56.457
that wouldn't be
a problem at all.

01:04:56.501 --> 01:04:58.024
Couple of phone calls.

01:04:58.068 --> 01:05:00.461
But we would to have to
have our agreement in place.

01:05:00.505 --> 01:05:01.245
Sure.

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:15.259
-Eden.
-What?

01:05:15.302 --> 01:05:16.564
Don't.

01:05:16.608 --> 01:05:18.088
We can't make any
decisions until we see

01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:19.828
what else is on that phone.

01:05:19.872 --> 01:05:21.613
It doesn't matter.

01:05:21.656 --> 01:05:23.093
What do you mean?

01:05:26.096 --> 01:05:27.924
[Astrid] Miss, your
friend is right.

01:05:27.967 --> 01:05:31.188
No matter what you do,
it is not going to change

01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:32.667
what transpired.

01:05:34.539 --> 01:05:37.150
[Zara] That municipal contract.

01:05:37.194 --> 01:05:39.283
It's a big deal, right?

01:05:39.326 --> 01:05:43.678
We have been trying
to get one for years.

01:05:43.722 --> 01:05:46.072
[Zara] How much is it worth?

01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:56.517
We wouldn't have to worry
about money anymore.

01:05:56.561 --> 01:05:59.259
[Zara] And your dad could
finally afford his surgery.

01:05:59.303 --> 01:06:01.958
You wouldn't have to watch
him limp around every day.

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:06.963
Penbrook is all we have talked
about since we were kids.

01:06:07.006 --> 01:06:07.789
I know.

01:06:09.226 --> 01:06:12.751
And I need you there
with me next year.

01:06:16.494 --> 01:06:18.626
We can't let them
get away with this.

01:06:20.063 --> 01:06:22.891
My son, I assure you, will
be dealt with appropriately.

01:06:22.935 --> 01:06:24.241
You have my word.

01:06:24.284 --> 01:06:26.243
You're on my side, right?

01:06:26.286 --> 01:06:29.028
I mean, you, you have to
think about Melissa's family.

01:06:29.072 --> 01:06:31.683
-What about your family?
-Zara.

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:40.822
[Joel] It's your
decision, sweetheart.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.013
We're not making a deal
until we watch that video.

01:07:12.506 --> 01:07:14.682
[horn honking in video]

01:07:14.726 --> 01:07:16.119
[Gooch in video] Schro.

01:07:16.162 --> 01:07:17.163
Look at her, dude,
you're fucking scaring

01:07:17.207 --> 01:07:18.164
the shit out of her.

01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:19.252
Can we just let her go home?

01:07:19.296 --> 01:07:21.080
[Schroder] Fuck, shut up!

01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:29.784
-[Shroder] Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:07:29.828 --> 01:07:31.308
-[Kendra] Dude, you're drunk.
You're fucking drunk.

01:07:31.351 --> 01:07:32.222
[Gooch] Bro, you're
gonna fucking hit her!

01:07:32.265 --> 01:07:33.179
[Schroder] Fuck this bitch.

01:07:33.223 --> 01:07:34.311
[Gooch] Dude, no, don't...

01:07:34.354 --> 01:07:35.790
[Kendra] Dude, no.

01:07:35.834 --> 01:07:37.444
[Schroder] Bro, get
your hand off the wheel.

01:07:37.488 --> 01:07:39.316
[Gooch] Schroder, please
just fucking pull over...

01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:40.708
[Kendra] You gotta
chill out, man.

01:07:40.752 --> 01:07:42.101
[Gooch] before you do
something fucking stupid.

01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:43.842
-[girl screams]
-[Gooch] Hey, hey watch out!

01:07:43.885 --> 01:07:45.496
[thumping and yelling]

01:07:45.539 --> 01:07:46.323
-[Kendra] What the fuck?!
-[Gooch] What the fuck?!

01:07:46.366 --> 01:07:47.802
[Kendra] Holy shit!

01:07:47.846 --> 01:07:49.152
[Gooch] Schroder, what
the fuck was that?!

01:07:49.195 --> 01:07:50.805
[Kendra] Oh, shit.

01:07:50.849 --> 01:07:52.198
[Gooch] You just
fucking ran over her!

01:07:52.242 --> 01:07:54.809
[insects chirping]

01:07:54.853 --> 01:07:57.160
[Kendra] Fucking shit, bro!

01:07:57.203 --> 01:07:58.030
[Gooch] What the fuck!

01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.118
[Shroder] Shit.

01:07:59.162 --> 01:07:59.988
Shit.

01:08:26.798 --> 01:08:28.147
[both grunt]

01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:29.192
[water splashing]

01:08:39.593 --> 01:08:40.942
That's what I was
trying to save you.

01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:46.818
You're too young to make
a decision that difficult.

01:08:47.906 --> 01:08:49.342
It's not really that
hard of a decision.

01:08:49.386 --> 01:08:50.603
We're gonna leave and I'm
taking the phone with me.

01:08:50.648 --> 01:08:51.431
Let's go.

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:54.346
Barrett.

01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:56.219
[Schroder] Where do
you think you're going?

01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:59.004
[Joel] Back your ass up, son.

01:08:59.831 --> 01:09:02.225
-Zara.
-I don't feel so good.

01:09:03.661 --> 01:09:05.358
I think they've done
something to us.

01:09:05.402 --> 01:09:06.359
Barrett, Barrett, Barrett.

01:09:10.710 --> 01:09:12.017
[Eden] Hey, come on.

01:09:17.675 --> 01:09:19.633
[solemn music]

01:09:19.676 --> 01:09:20.460
[Eden] Come on.

01:09:21.244 --> 01:09:22.288
Come on.

01:09:34.779 --> 01:09:36.997
Think about it, Eden.

01:09:37.041 --> 01:09:38.348
Would you rather
four years in prison

01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:40.827
or four years in the
college of your dreams?

01:09:40.871 --> 01:09:41.872
[Joel] Prison? What's
he talking about?

01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:43.221
[Eden] It doesn't
matter, come on.

01:09:47.747 --> 01:09:51.796
These girls are responsible
for a young woman's death.

01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:53.232
Kendra's dead?

01:09:54.277 --> 01:09:55.887
Unfortunately.

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:58.019
[Zara] But it
wasn't our fault.

01:09:58.063 --> 01:09:59.369
It was self-defense.

01:09:59.412 --> 01:10:01.806
Well, I'm sure that's what
your lawyer will argue,

01:10:01.849 --> 01:10:04.764
but it might be a little
bit difficult finding one.

01:10:04.809 --> 01:10:07.942
I know every prosecutor,
DA, and judge in the county,

01:10:07.986 --> 01:10:10.728
and I'll see to it that you
serve the maximum sentence.

01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:13.905
[tense music]

01:10:17.865 --> 01:10:19.258
[Shroder] Kendra's dead.

01:10:21.478 --> 01:10:23.349
This is all your fault.

01:10:24.611 --> 01:10:26.612
Go get that phone, okay?

01:10:28.659 --> 01:10:31.401
[tense music]

01:10:31.443 --> 01:10:33.272
Get it yourself.

01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:34.447
[Eden] Come on.

01:10:34.491 --> 01:10:35.273
Zara.

01:10:38.582 --> 01:10:40.105
-[Eden] Dad?
-[Joel] I got it.

01:10:40.366 --> 01:10:41.585
-Dad?
-I got it.

01:10:43.891 --> 01:10:44.936
No, no, no.

01:10:48.679 --> 01:10:51.464
[Eden grunting]

01:11:00.865 --> 01:11:01.952
Dad, she's getting away.

01:11:01.996 --> 01:11:02.780
Barrett.

01:11:09.612 --> 01:11:11.832
[solemn music]

01:11:11.876 --> 01:11:12.659
Oh.

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:19.710
[Zara and Eden panting]

01:11:32.853 --> 01:11:36.204
You didn't really think
that I would let you

01:11:36.248 --> 01:11:38.250
hurt my family, did you?

01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:55.398
[eerie music]

01:12:03.754 --> 01:12:04.537
[Shroder] Hey.

01:12:07.148 --> 01:12:08.324
There you are.

01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:12.153
It's okay.

01:12:20.553 --> 01:12:22.642
[Eden] What did you do?

01:12:24.731 --> 01:12:27.386
Lorazepam and propofol.

01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:30.258
At high enough
doses, it induces you

01:12:30.302 --> 01:12:33.174
into temporary paralysis.

01:12:33.218 --> 01:12:35.394
Trust me, I know.

01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:37.701
My parents used to slip
it in my food and drink

01:12:37.744 --> 01:12:39.311
when I was a kid.

01:13:18.437 --> 01:13:20.570
I wanted to tell the police.

01:13:21.527 --> 01:13:24.008
But Mother wouldn't have it.

01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:26.271
[insects chirping]

01:13:26.314 --> 01:13:29.492
[eerie music]

01:13:29.535 --> 01:13:31.710
You don't have to do this.

01:13:33.191 --> 01:13:33.974
I do.

01:13:35.454 --> 01:13:36.412
You don't.

01:13:37.848 --> 01:13:40.459
[eerie music]

01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:48.206
-[Eden sobbing]
-Don't cry.

01:13:48.249 --> 01:13:50.861
Please, you don't
have to do this.

01:13:50.904 --> 01:13:51.905
It's okay.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:53.864
It's okay.

01:13:56.823 --> 01:13:59.652
[Eden grunting]

01:14:05.266 --> 01:14:06.572
Come on, son.

01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:08.531
Get outta the car.

01:14:08.574 --> 01:14:11.447
[tense music]

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:12.360
Schroder.

01:14:15.059 --> 01:14:15.842
No.

01:14:42.347 --> 01:14:43.130
Gooch.

01:14:44.392 --> 01:14:46.394
Put Kendra in the trunk.

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:48.484
Why?

01:14:48.527 --> 01:14:49.441
Because she's
got a hole in her

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:51.965
and it deserves
an explanation.

01:14:55.925 --> 01:14:56.709
I can't.

01:14:56.753 --> 01:14:58.189
I'm sorry?

01:14:58.232 --> 01:14:59.451
Gooch?

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.409
Well, you wouldn't
have to if you didn't

01:15:01.452 --> 01:15:03.411
shoot your little film.

01:15:03.455 --> 01:15:04.237
Go on with it.

01:15:11.376 --> 01:15:13.726
[tense music]

01:15:24.432 --> 01:15:25.912
-[liquor sloshing]
-[Joel grunting]

01:15:35.791 --> 01:15:37.532
[Schroder] Come on.

01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:06.692
Do you know, Eden...

01:16:10.914 --> 01:16:14.918
You'd have done really,
really good at Penbrook.

01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:17.398
I should know.

01:16:19.879 --> 01:16:22.708
I was a scholarship
girl myself.

01:16:26.364 --> 01:16:27.713
[Eden whimpering] Please.

01:16:29.193 --> 01:16:30.411
Night night.

01:16:56.568 --> 01:16:58.918
[tense music]

01:17:05.011 --> 01:17:06.796
-[flesh squelching]
-[blood squirting]

01:17:06.839 --> 01:17:09.668
[Gooch gagging]

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:37.261
-[Gooch sputtering]
-[tense music continues]

01:18:15.952 --> 01:18:18.737
[water splashing]

01:18:22.741 --> 01:18:24.874
[water rushing]

01:18:31.968 --> 01:18:34.927
[girls coughing]

01:18:36.799 --> 01:18:37.930
[Eden] Come on!

01:18:37.974 --> 01:18:39.758
[girls coughing]

01:19:01.388 --> 01:19:03.869
[Eden groaning]

01:19:13.313 --> 01:19:14.097
Dad?

01:19:20.973 --> 01:19:21.757
Dad.

01:19:29.199 --> 01:19:31.809
[tense music]

01:19:34.639 --> 01:19:36.989
[girls grunt]

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:46.956
[birds chirping]

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.611
Eden, this isn't the way.

01:19:50.655 --> 01:19:51.874
We need to go to the police.

01:19:53.876 --> 01:19:54.659
We will.

01:20:06.192 --> 01:20:08.804
[eerie music]

01:21:00.768 --> 01:21:02.987
[Zara crying]

01:21:14.085 --> 01:21:18.090
[reporter talking indistinctly]

01:21:30.710 --> 01:21:33.800
Less than one hour ago, a
car careened off Winslow Road

01:21:33.844 --> 01:21:35.847
and plunged into Tillery River.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.981
Authorities have recovered three
bodies from inside the car,

01:21:39.023 --> 01:21:41.157
a man and two teenagers.

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:45.117
Warning, some of these
images are distressing.

01:21:45.161 --> 01:21:47.990
A police correspondent
called the deaths, quote,

01:21:48.032 --> 01:21:49.687
"unfortunate."

01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:51.818
Preliminary findings
had attributed this

01:21:51.862 --> 01:21:53.821
to an alcohol related incident,

01:21:53.865 --> 01:21:55.998
but as you can see
behind me, this is still

01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:57.651
a very active scene.

01:21:57.695 --> 01:21:59.740
What was at first
deemed an accident

01:21:59.784 --> 01:22:01.960
now looks like there's
some suspicious activity

01:22:02.004 --> 01:22:04.789
involving stab wounds
onto the bodies,

01:22:04.832 --> 01:22:06.704
indicating some
degree of foul play.

01:22:06.746 --> 01:22:09.098
[eerie music]

01:22:17.496 --> 01:22:18.934
Hello, angel.

01:22:24.678 --> 01:22:26.985
[suspenseful music]

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:06.329

[Eden gasping]

01:23:42.234 --> 01:23:44.106
[water splashing]

01:23:46.195 --> 01:23:48.197
[Eden breathing heavily]

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:50.895
[eerie music]

01:24:14.571 --> 01:24:18.791
[electricity sizzling
and popping]

01:24:30.195 --> 01:24:32.806
[Eden grunts]

01:24:32.850 --> 01:24:35.287
[Eden panting]

01:24:47.517 --> 01:24:50.128
[tense music]

01:25:16.675 --> 01:25:19.157
[gun clicks]

01:25:37.523 --> 01:25:38.307
Mom.

01:25:41.484 --> 01:25:44.182
[car horn honking outside]

01:25:50.884 --> 01:25:53.409
[horn honks, engine revs]

01:25:53.452 --> 01:25:56.151
Get the fuck outta my
car, you fucking bitch!

01:25:56.193 --> 01:25:57.804
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:25:57.848 --> 01:26:00.546
[engine revving]

01:26:07.249 --> 01:26:09.076
-[engine racing]
-[tires squeal]

01:26:10.339 --> 01:26:11.427
Fuck you, Eden!

01:26:11.469 --> 01:26:12.210
[gunshot bangs]

01:26:12.254 --> 01:26:15.126
[Eden shouting]

01:26:21.219 --> 01:26:23.656
[Eden gasping]

01:26:27.486 --> 01:26:29.880
[tense music]

01:27:27.894 --> 01:27:30.245
[Eden shouts]

01:27:37.991 --> 01:27:39.818
[Eden shouts]

01:27:45.389 --> 01:27:47.784

-[Schroder groans]

01:28:07.237 --> 01:28:09.806

01:28:38.050 --> 01:28:40.532
[Eden panting]

01:28:48.018 --> 01:28:51.500
School's gonna be
real weird on Monday.

01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:55.416
No, no.

01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:56.548
[Zara shouts]

01:28:56.592 --> 01:28:57.375
[thudding]

01:28:57.419 --> 01:29:02.032
[Schroder groaning]

01:29:02.075 --> 01:29:02.859
Asshole.

01:29:07.864 --> 01:29:08.647
Oh my god.

01:29:11.302 --> 01:29:12.608
It's okay.

01:29:12.651 --> 01:29:14.914
It's okay, it's okay.

01:29:14.958 --> 01:29:15.827
Yeah, yeah.

01:29:17.047 --> 01:29:19.615
[Eden grunting in pain]

01:29:20.964 --> 01:29:21.746
Okay.

01:29:22.879 --> 01:29:23.662
Okay.

01:29:28.624 --> 01:29:30.930
[Zara mumbles]

01:29:30.974 --> 01:29:32.541
You're killing me.

01:29:33.933 --> 01:29:36.545
[eerie music]

01:29:46.903 --> 01:29:48.513
I'm gonna get you home, okay?

01:29:48.557 --> 01:29:49.427
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:29:49.471 --> 01:29:50.428
