00:01.632 --> 00:05.502
Why did you kill
12 CIA officers in Chicago?

00:05.636 --> 00:07.303
I'm sorry
if this caused you problems.

00:07.438 --> 00:08.838
I keep sticking my neck out
for you,

00:08.923 --> 00:10.043
and all you do is lie to me.

00:10.141 --> 00:11.007
That's not true.

00:11.092 --> 00:12.292
What about your heart
condition

00:12.309 --> 00:13.977
or wherever the hell you were
for four months?

00:14.095 --> 00:15.645
Get these people out
of the cars and move them back.

00:15.730 --> 00:18.481
Caitlyn Cook put a bomb on one
of the motorcade vehicles.

00:18.599 --> 00:20.850
You'll never stop her!

00:21.485 --> 00:22.652
Alec.

00:22.770 --> 00:24.688
They know about your
relationship with Caitlyn.

00:24.822 --> 00:26.823
Someone at the Russian embassy
knew about Belenko.

00:26.907 --> 00:28.942
If we can access
Mashkov's files,

00:29.076 --> 00:31.327
we can link Belenko
to Chicago.

00:31.445 --> 00:33.697
When you have the chance,
take this phone,

00:33.864 --> 00:35.264
press it against his
for 30 seconds.

00:35.366 --> 00:36.486
Technology will do the rest.

00:36.534 --> 00:38.535
Stop!

00:38.669 --> 00:40.203
You recognize her?
No.

00:40.371 --> 00:41.671
Tony, it's 5:30
in the morning.

00:41.789 --> 00:43.173
What are you doing?
I'm a little bit drunk.

00:43.290 --> 00:44.958
I'm coming over--
just promise me

00:45.092 --> 00:47.177
you're not gonna have another
drink until I get there, okay?

00:47.294 --> 00:49.679
Tony died. They're telling me
he drank himself to death.

00:49.780 --> 00:51.347
I don't believe
that's what killed him.

00:51.432 --> 00:52.482
What are you doing here?

00:52.583 --> 00:54.343
McQuaid is recovering
from the gunshot wound.

00:54.385 --> 00:55.552
Is he out of surgery?
Is he conscious?

00:55.720 --> 00:57.320
You can ask him yourself.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:41.182 --> 01:42.599
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:49.156 --> 01:51.024
Doesn't look like you have one
of those for me.

01:53.110 --> 01:55.695
That shouldn't stop you
from having some

01:55.830 --> 01:57.997
or taking your walk of shame.

02:01.318 --> 02:04.087
And here I was, thinking
that last night meant something.

02:09.676 --> 02:12.295
- Where are you going?
- Uh, my place.

02:12.379 --> 02:15.048
I have to change
before I head to the office.

02:16.517 --> 02:17.801
You hit the ground running.

02:17.935 --> 02:19.855
That's the only way I know
how to hit the ground.

02:23.808 --> 02:26.142
- It's Langley.
- You should answer it.

02:29.146 --> 02:31.564
- Yeah.
- Hey, Annie, it's me--

02:31.699 --> 02:33.983
Eric, uh, Eric Barber.
We used to work together.

02:34.068 --> 02:37.070
I remember you, Eric.
What's up?

02:37.204 --> 02:40.540
Uh, we have a bit
of a situation here.

02:40.658 --> 02:43.126
What kind of situation?

02:43.260 --> 02:45.662
It's about Auggie.

03:04.481 --> 03:06.749
Auggie.

03:06.851 --> 03:08.067
Annie,
what are you doing here?

03:08.185 --> 03:10.653
Bailing you out.

03:10.771 --> 03:12.388
Barber called me.

03:12.523 --> 03:15.191
He said you got into a fight
with that medical examiner.

03:15.276 --> 03:18.528
We had a disagreement
over what caused Tony's death.

03:18.662 --> 03:20.947
- So you threw him into a wall?
- I pushed him.

03:21.081 --> 03:22.532
Barber wasn't supposed
to call you.

03:22.666 --> 03:24.367
Why didn't you call me?

03:24.501 --> 03:27.203
We haven't exactly been
getting along lately.

03:27.338 --> 03:29.339
That's why you haven't been
returning my calls?

03:31.792 --> 03:34.928
It's been a tough week.

03:35.045 --> 03:37.547
Come on.
We're parked outside.

03:43.103 --> 03:44.854
You think Tony was murdered?

03:44.972 --> 03:46.973
They said he died
of alcohol poisoning--

03:47.057 --> 03:48.892
too much vodka.

03:48.976 --> 03:50.894
Tony didn't drink vodka.
He was a bourbon man.

03:50.978 --> 03:53.279
You said he just fell
off the wagon after three years.

03:53.397 --> 03:54.564
Yeah, meaning what?

03:54.732 --> 03:55.899
Meaning maybe he wasn't
that discerning

03:56.066 --> 03:57.567
when it came to getting drunk.
Annie, I knew Tony.

03:57.735 --> 03:59.235
He wouldn't drink himself
to death.

03:59.370 --> 04:00.954
Someone just wanted it
to look that way.

04:01.071 --> 04:02.789
Who would want that?

04:02.907 --> 04:04.040
Belenko.

04:04.158 --> 04:06.342
Belenko?
You think this connects?

04:06.460 --> 04:08.161
There's a pattern
to his attacks.

04:08.295 --> 04:10.496
Each one killed a guy
from my unit.

04:10.631 --> 04:12.665
First, Charlie Schinderman
in Chicago.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.518
Then Mueller, which was based
on false Intel fed to us,

04:15.636 --> 04:17.420
and when you stopped
the motorcade bombing,

04:17.553 --> 04:18.671
he had Tony poisoned.

04:18.789 --> 04:20.473
You think Tony
was Belenko's target?

04:20.591 --> 04:23.226
Three of my guys dead
in three months.

04:23.344 --> 04:25.228
We're trained not to believe
in coincidences.

04:25.312 --> 04:26.846
Why would Belenko be targeting
guys from your unit?

04:26.981 --> 04:28.264
I haven't figured
that out yet.

04:28.399 --> 04:29.839
Have you ever crossed paths
with him?

04:29.850 --> 04:32.068
No. Not that I know of.

04:32.186 --> 04:34.520
We're here.

04:36.991 --> 04:38.908
I know I'm right
about Belenko.

04:39.026 --> 04:41.194
Then let's start by proving
Tony's death was foul play.

04:41.328 --> 04:44.697
We do that,
we can prove conspiracy.

04:47.384 --> 04:49.335
Okay.

04:55.626 --> 04:57.377
Hey, buddy.

04:57.511 --> 04:59.012
Glad to see you didn't get
shanked in there.

04:59.129 --> 05:03.383
I specifically made
my one call to you, Barber.

05:03.517 --> 05:04.884
Hey, man, how was I to know

05:05.019 --> 05:06.636
you and Annie weren't
on speaking terms, okay?

05:06.804 --> 05:08.164
I thought
you two were inseparable.

05:08.305 --> 05:09.939
Just so that
I've got a heads-up,

05:10.024 --> 05:13.226
has word about this already made
its way to Joan?

05:13.360 --> 05:15.445
- Yes.
- Yeah.

05:18.649 --> 05:20.650
- Will you excuse us, Barber?
- Yeah.

05:20.734 --> 05:23.252
Joan, before you get into it,
you need to know

05:23.370 --> 05:24.970
there is more going on
with Tony's death.

05:27.791 --> 05:29.575
Auggie...

05:29.660 --> 05:32.078
I understand that you're
grieving the loss of your friend

05:32.212 --> 05:33.692
and that you're searching
for answers.

05:33.747 --> 05:36.549
But when it comes to addiction,
there aren't any.

05:36.667 --> 05:39.769
Tony's addiction
isn't what killed him.

05:39.837 --> 05:42.472
I'm sending you home.
Take the rest of the week off.

05:42.589 --> 05:44.590
I don't need a vacation.

05:44.675 --> 05:46.142
You want me to call it
a suspension?

05:46.260 --> 05:47.593
Joan, don't do this.

05:47.728 --> 05:49.395
Auggie, you punched
a county official.

05:49.513 --> 05:51.180
I didn't punch him.
I shoved him.

05:51.265 --> 05:53.733
Look, just listen to me.
No, you listen to me.

05:53.851 --> 05:56.903
You were arrested,
which leaves me no choice.

05:59.106 --> 06:00.523
I'll see you next week.

07:26.276 --> 07:28.611
Who is it?

07:28.745 --> 07:31.447
Auggie, it's me.

07:34.918 --> 07:36.252
Hey, it's late.

07:36.370 --> 07:37.650
I broke
into Tony Salgado's house

07:37.704 --> 07:39.205
looking for evidence
of homicide.

07:39.339 --> 07:41.624
- Well, did you find any?
- Yeah.

07:41.792 --> 07:44.961
I called in a favor and had
Tony's vodka bottles tested.

07:45.129 --> 07:46.429
What'd you find?

07:46.547 --> 07:49.515
Traces of synthetic
tetrodotoxin.

07:49.633 --> 07:52.552
No wonder the M.E. missed it.

07:52.703 --> 07:55.388
That wouldn't get flagged
in a basic tox screen.

07:55.472 --> 07:58.808
There are only a handful of labs
in the world that can make it.

07:58.976 --> 08:00.776
Tony was murdered.

08:00.894 --> 08:03.196
Auggie, you could be next.
We need to take this to Joan.

08:03.313 --> 08:05.073
No, no way, we're not taking
this to the CIA,

08:05.149 --> 08:06.449
not after they just benched me.

08:06.533 --> 08:08.034
Auggie, you need to be
protected.

08:08.152 --> 08:10.903
Annie, what I need is to find
out who made that toxin

08:11.038 --> 08:12.738
and link them to Belenko.

08:12.873 --> 08:15.408
I have to do this for Tony,
for my unit.

08:15.542 --> 08:16.909
I have to do this for you.

08:17.044 --> 08:19.629
We need to move fast before
Belenko makes his next move.

08:21.036 --> 08:25.036

08:38.513 --> 08:40.393
Thought you could use a bite
before the red-eye.

08:40.465 --> 08:41.965
Mm.

08:45.353 --> 08:47.634
Are you sure that that lab
that you're going to in Germany

08:47.689 --> 08:49.189
is the right one?

08:49.307 --> 08:51.358
Well, there's only eight labs
in the world

08:51.476 --> 08:53.393
that synthesize the toxin
that killed Tony,

08:53.478 --> 08:56.613
and KLF in Essen
is one of them.

08:56.748 --> 09:01.235
And Belenko flew through there
on his way back from Istanbul.

09:01.369 --> 09:03.820
You know, I, uh--
I should come with you.

09:03.955 --> 09:06.907
You still have two bullet
holes in your chest.

09:07.041 --> 09:10.627
So you think
that I would slow you down?

09:10.712 --> 09:13.797
Well, I think
you're more valuable here.

09:13.915 --> 09:15.582
And you have a company
to rebuild.

09:15.667 --> 09:18.502
Hey, hold-hold on.

09:18.636 --> 09:20.504
Hold on.
Your car's not here yet.

09:23.424 --> 09:26.176
Now it is.

09:26.344 --> 09:30.180
Can you do me a favor
before I go?

09:30.315 --> 09:31.598
Name it.

09:33.685 --> 09:35.402
Auggie.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.238
Annie.

09:38.356 --> 09:40.741
Auggie,
nice to meet you.

09:40.858 --> 09:44.278
Ryan McQuaid?

09:44.412 --> 09:46.613
I'm sorry for your loss.

09:46.698 --> 09:49.700
Yeah, thanks.
How are you feeling?

09:49.867 --> 09:51.835
Well, it takes more
than a couple of bullets

09:51.919 --> 09:53.203
to keep a frog man down.

09:53.338 --> 09:54.588
And in true Navy SEAL style,

09:54.739 --> 09:56.039
you can write a tell-all book
about it.

09:56.124 --> 09:57.958
Okay,
I have a plane to catch.

09:58.042 --> 09:59.402
Auggie, will you walk me
to my car?

09:59.510 --> 10:01.845
Sure.
Nice to meet you, McQuaid.

10:01.963 --> 10:03.380
You too.

10:03.548 --> 10:07.050
Have fun.
Will do.

10:07.218 --> 10:09.186
Got something for me?

10:09.304 --> 10:12.723
This is everything
on KLF Chemical.

10:12.857 --> 10:15.192
They're pretty specialized--
neurotoxins, nerve agents.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.611
They sell to a lot
of military contractors,

10:17.729 --> 10:20.480
so getting in there is gonna be
almost impossible.

10:20.565 --> 10:21.815
Recon could take weeks.

10:21.949 --> 10:24.451
You may not have weeks.
I'll find a shortcut.

10:24.569 --> 10:26.403
Sounds good.
Call me on my cell.

10:26.537 --> 10:28.739
We're not flying air Langley
on this one.

10:28.873 --> 10:30.657
Oh, you're gonna be all right,
aren't you?

10:30.742 --> 10:31.958
Yeah.

10:32.076 --> 10:33.627
Is there anyone else
in your unit--

10:33.745 --> 10:35.295
I mean,
anyone else still alive?

10:37.465 --> 10:38.465
No.

10:40.168 --> 10:43.837
Listen, Walker, I...

10:43.971 --> 10:46.757
I appreciate
you doing this for me.

10:46.891 --> 10:49.259
You'd do the same for me.

12:43.541 --> 12:45.542
Wait to cross.

12:45.676 --> 12:48.462
Wait to cross.

12:48.596 --> 12:51.815
Safe to cross.

12:51.933 --> 12:56.470
Safe to cross.

12:56.604 --> 12:59.139
Wait to cross.

12:59.273 --> 13:01.308
Wait to cross.

13:01.392 --> 13:05.312
Wait to cross.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.849
13, 8, 7...

13:42.984 --> 13:44.684
Mayflower.

13:44.819 --> 13:48.071
13, 8, 7...

13:48.189 --> 13:49.773
Mayflower.

13:53.077 --> 13:54.778
Any hits on the brunette?

13:57.181 --> 13:59.499
She lit up our internal
database like a Christmas tree.

13:59.617 --> 14:00.867
She's an FSB operative

14:01.002 --> 14:02.702
with the special activities
directorate,

14:02.853 --> 14:03.853
trained with the SVR.

14:03.955 --> 14:05.171
Name is Olga Akarova.

14:05.323 --> 14:07.457
She's one of their best--
the real deal.

14:07.592 --> 14:09.593
- What about lady lab coat?
- Less on her.

14:09.677 --> 14:11.878
Britta Kaplan--
born and raised in Johannesburg,

14:12.013 --> 14:15.432
studied organic chemistry
at E.T.H. Zurich.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.910
She plays <i> Words With Friends</i>
a lot,

14:16.934 --> 14:19.135
though she doesn't have
many actual friends.

14:19.303 --> 14:20.387
She's Belenko's chemist.

14:20.521 --> 14:21.888
That's why Olga's
monitoring her.

14:21.973 --> 14:24.024
Britta must be the one who made
them the toxin.

14:24.141 --> 14:26.893
She can provide a link to what
Belenko wants from Auggie.

14:28.145 --> 14:30.413
You know, I know
that I have to rebuild the fort,

14:30.531 --> 14:33.533
but it is killing me
not being there with you.

14:33.651 --> 14:36.286
The sacrifices you're making
are going to be worth it--

14:36.370 --> 14:37.970
promise.
- Just tell me that you're going

14:38.039 --> 14:39.573
to nail the bad guy's ass
to the wall on this.

14:39.707 --> 14:41.547
We're gonna nail
the bad guy's ass to the wall.

14:46.955 --> 14:49.538
SIGINT just got the analysis
back from the phone

14:49.539 --> 14:52.841
that Sydney hot-synched
with our diplomat friend.

14:52.959 --> 14:55.677
Did Mashkov's phone
provide anything of value?

14:55.762 --> 14:57.429
Turns out he's more connected
than we thought.

14:57.547 --> 14:59.965
He has relationships with top
officials at the FSB,

15:00.099 --> 15:03.685
the Duma,
and the Kremlin.

15:03.803 --> 15:04.820
This is great Intel.

15:04.937 --> 15:07.973
Sydney did remarkable work
for a civilian.

15:11.527 --> 15:14.563
We need to get her in deeper.

15:14.731 --> 15:17.899
Mashkov might have access
to Intel on Belenko.

15:18.034 --> 15:19.914
Getting our hands on it
would be a game changer.

15:19.952 --> 15:21.536
She's not
a seasoned operative.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.406
Joan, we have operatives
seven years in

15:24.540 --> 15:27.209
that would not have been able
to pull this off.

15:27.326 --> 15:28.794
Mashkov is too connected.

15:28.911 --> 15:30.912
One false move,
and she'd be compromised,

15:31.047 --> 15:32.714
which would blow back
directly onto us.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.832
She's out of her depth here.
I think she can do it.

15:34.884 --> 15:36.551
I strongly caution
against it.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.971
Noted,
but I made my decision.

15:43.009 --> 15:44.226
Mrs. Campbell?

15:44.310 --> 15:47.012
You're wanted down in polygraph.

15:47.146 --> 15:48.513
"Polygraph"?

15:48.598 --> 15:50.465
That's what I'm told.

15:52.185 --> 15:55.020
Unscheduled?

15:55.104 --> 15:56.855
Yeah.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.942
Happens to the best of us.

16:03.946 --> 16:06.031
I'll keep that in mind.

16:10.002 --> 16:12.587
Olga Akarova is the woman
you saw in Istanbul?

16:12.705 --> 16:15.707
Yeah, Olga was following
Britta Kaplan, a KLF chemist.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.459
And you think Britta
is the one who made

16:17.593 --> 16:19.261
the toxin for Belenko?
Yeah.

16:19.378 --> 16:21.763
I think Olga's here keeping
an eye on Britta for Belenko.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.431
How'd you get the I.D.s?

16:23.549 --> 16:25.233
Ryan helped me.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.568
Really?

16:26.702 --> 16:28.382
Yeah, well, I know
we don't have any access

16:28.471 --> 16:29.604
to CIA resources,

16:29.722 --> 16:31.042
so I looped him in
for facial rec.

16:31.140 --> 16:32.691
Yeah. I guess I just wish
you had run it by me first.

16:32.809 --> 16:35.694
It was my impression this Op
was just between the two of us.

16:35.812 --> 16:38.847
I'm guessing you hit McQuaid up
for the guy shadowing me?

16:38.981 --> 16:40.148
How'd you find out?

16:40.233 --> 16:41.483
My spidey sense was tingling,

16:41.567 --> 16:43.285
so I had Barber pull up
street-cam footage

16:43.402 --> 16:44.820
from outside my place.

16:44.954 --> 16:46.594
I just want to make sure
you're protected.

16:46.656 --> 16:49.074
- I didn't ask you to do that.
- I know.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.745
All right, let's see what we
can find on Britta Kaplan.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.430
She's from Johannesburg.

16:55.498 --> 16:57.258
She doesn't have
a big social-media presence.

16:57.333 --> 16:58.800
That's not enough
for an approach.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.502
And I got to say, it's gonna
take me a while

17:00.636 --> 17:02.771
to get anything useful
without my usual tech.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.105
Yeah, which is why
I'm thinking

17:04.240 --> 17:05.840
of breaking
into her apartment.

17:06.008 --> 17:08.009
What about the FSB agent
shadowing her?

17:08.176 --> 17:10.929
I'll stay off her radar.

17:11.063 --> 17:14.598
Did you work in the Balkans
during the Yugoslav wars?

17:17.854 --> 17:19.688
Yes.

17:19.856 --> 17:20.976
Were you stationed in Kosovo

17:21.022 --> 17:23.491
from March '98
through February '99?

17:23.608 --> 17:24.943
- Yes.
- During that time,

17:25.077 --> 17:26.997
were you involved in training
members of the KLA,

17:27.029 --> 17:30.498
also known
as the Kosovo Liberation Army?

17:30.616 --> 17:33.618
Yes, per my assignment.

17:33.769 --> 17:35.954
"Yes" or "no" answers only,
please.

17:36.038 --> 17:38.089
I'm not sure if you're aware,

17:38.207 --> 17:41.126
but I did my annual polygraph
two months ago.

17:41.210 --> 17:44.129
I'd like to know
what this is about.

17:44.213 --> 17:46.548
I'm just here
to ask questions.

17:46.682 --> 17:49.134
Ready to continue?

20:49.360 --> 20:52.529
- Who is it?
- Auggie, it's Ryan McQuaid.

20:56.701 --> 20:59.786
I'm not at the CIA right now,
so I can't offer you a contract.

20:59.921 --> 21:01.621
Oh, so you'd give me
a contract.

21:01.756 --> 21:03.006
That's good to know.

21:03.124 --> 21:04.708
Listen, while you're here,

21:04.842 --> 21:08.128
you want to introduce me
to my babysitter?

21:08.262 --> 21:09.713
Hey, Pete.
Come meet Auggie.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.302
- Hey, Auggie.
- Pete.

21:15.386 --> 21:18.054
Thanks, Pete.
Back to your post.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.475
You mind if I come in?
I brought you something.

21:21.626 --> 21:24.478
Oh, come on in, man.

21:24.612 --> 21:27.831
I hope it's not
too forward of me

21:27.949 --> 21:30.317
showing up like this,
bearing gifts.

21:30.451 --> 21:32.235
Guess it depends
on what it is.

21:32.403 --> 21:34.321
It's a military-grade laptop

21:34.455 --> 21:37.290
that conforms to FIPS-140
cryptography standards.

21:37.408 --> 21:38.992
I even had it retrofitted

21:39.126 --> 21:40.961
with a refreshable
braille display.

21:41.078 --> 21:45.332
Let's call it
an early birthday present.

21:47.251 --> 21:49.669
Well, I'm not big on birthdays,
but I'll take it.

21:49.804 --> 21:52.339
Figured a guy who can hack
as well as you can

21:52.473 --> 21:54.841
might want to take it
for a spin.

21:57.979 --> 22:01.348
Why are you really here,
McQuaid?

22:01.482 --> 22:02.516
I just want to make sure

22:02.650 --> 22:04.184
that Annie has
the best available resources

22:04.268 --> 22:05.519
backing her up.

22:05.653 --> 22:09.022
Well, I assure you she does.

22:12.159 --> 22:13.777
Thanks for the gear.

22:13.945 --> 22:15.028
Don't mention it.

22:15.162 --> 22:18.031
If you need anything else,
just let me know.

22:24.338 --> 22:26.458
I found a rejection letter
for an article Britta wrote

22:26.507 --> 22:28.391
from <i>Malmo Chemical Journal.</i>

22:28.509 --> 22:31.878
I could use that as an intro,
say I'm on the board.

22:32.013 --> 22:33.653
Operatives usually
have to prep for months

22:33.681 --> 22:35.799
before they can understand
the advanced chem lingo

22:35.883 --> 22:37.183
needed to pull that off.

22:37.301 --> 22:39.302
Well, chemists just don't talk
about formulas.

22:39.470 --> 22:42.722
No, but, honestly, right now
I'm more concerned about Olga.

22:42.857 --> 22:44.524
You said she pulled a bug
out of Britta's apartment?

22:44.642 --> 22:46.393
Yeah, but we already knew
she was surveilling Britta.

22:46.527 --> 22:47.687
Nah, this is bigger
than that.

22:47.812 --> 22:50.697
I'm accessing
some classified FSB Intel--

22:50.848 --> 22:52.399
D.I.A. has a file on Olga.

22:52.483 --> 22:53.867
How'd you manage that?

22:53.985 --> 22:55.819
McQuaid--
he brought me some tech.

22:55.987 --> 22:57.404
He did?
That was thoughtful.

22:57.538 --> 22:58.538
Come on, you knew.

22:58.656 --> 22:59.923
- Auggie.
- It's fine.

23:00.057 --> 23:02.242
Turns out
it's decent hardware.

23:02.326 --> 23:04.828
But according to D.I.A.,

23:04.962 --> 23:07.330
Olga recently graduated
to wet work for the FSB--

23:07.465 --> 23:09.966
four suspected kills
in the last six months,

23:10.084 --> 23:12.002
three in Rotterdam,
one in Kiev.

23:12.136 --> 23:14.087
I'm sending you
the file right now.

23:14.221 --> 23:16.339
She may not be there
just to keep tabs on Britta.

23:16.507 --> 23:18.507
If she's here to kill her,
what is she waiting for?

23:18.509 --> 23:20.093
I mean,
why hasn't she done it yet?

23:20.227 --> 23:22.112
Well, maybe she's working
on something else for Belenko.

23:22.229 --> 23:23.680
Then I need to find out
what that is.

23:23.814 --> 23:25.348
I'm going to fast-track this.

23:25.483 --> 23:26.433
No, hey,
you need to hang back,

23:26.567 --> 23:28.047
at least until we can get
someone else

23:28.102 --> 23:29.582
on the ground there
to provide backup.

23:29.604 --> 23:31.488
Auggie, we don't have time
for that.

23:31.606 --> 23:33.440
Annie, there is
an FSB assassin in the mix.

23:33.524 --> 23:35.992
The reason I'm here is to make
sure nothing happens to you.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.444
Pete already
has that covered.

23:37.578 --> 23:38.695
Listen to me--

23:38.863 --> 23:40.196
the last thing I want
is to lose another friend.

23:40.281 --> 23:41.498
Now stand down!

23:41.616 --> 23:43.617
I don't want to lose
another friend either.

23:50.791 --> 23:53.293
Hello, Britta?

23:53.377 --> 23:54.794
Do I know you?

23:54.879 --> 23:57.047
No, you don't.

23:57.181 --> 23:59.265
And normally
I'd do this differently,

23:59.383 --> 24:02.552
but we don't have enough time.
Time for what?

24:02.687 --> 24:04.354
For me to explain
that Belenko

24:04.472 --> 24:06.973
has sent an assassin
to kill you.

24:07.108 --> 24:08.808
You have me confused
with someone else.

24:08.943 --> 24:10.977
I know that you made him
the tetrodotoxin.

24:11.095 --> 24:12.946
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

24:13.064 --> 24:14.898
I don't have time
for games, Britta.

24:14.982 --> 24:18.485
Belenko sent this woman
to kill you.

24:18.619 --> 24:20.620
He's done it before.

24:20.738 --> 24:22.822
He killed a woman
who worked for him in D.C.

24:22.957 --> 24:24.077
This doesn't make any sense.

24:24.125 --> 24:25.709
Why would he send someone
to kill me?

24:25.826 --> 24:27.160
Because you're close
to finishing

24:27.294 --> 24:29.346
what you're working on
for him.

24:29.463 --> 24:31.414
Why should I believe
anything you're saying?

24:31.549 --> 24:33.416
That woman in the photo
could be anyone.

24:33.551 --> 24:36.169
Look out the window.

24:36.320 --> 24:37.854
You see the brunette

24:37.972 --> 24:41.675
across the street
reading the newspaper?

24:41.809 --> 24:43.343
She's here for you.

24:45.012 --> 24:47.063
These are her victims.

24:48.516 --> 24:50.767
That's not
how you want to end up.

25:00.578 --> 25:02.112
She's coming this way.

25:02.246 --> 25:03.947
I can protect you,
but you have to tell me

25:04.081 --> 25:05.532
what you're working on
for Belenko.

25:05.666 --> 25:06.666
It's in my lab.

25:06.784 --> 25:08.368
Grab your stuff, slowly.

25:08.502 --> 25:09.836
We'll go out the back.

25:18.295 --> 25:19.796
They didn't say no.

25:19.964 --> 25:22.716
You and I both know
what that means.

25:22.850 --> 25:24.551
You're worried.

25:24.685 --> 25:26.553
Down to my last mag
in Fallujah--

25:26.687 --> 25:27.554
that had me worried.

25:27.638 --> 25:30.023
Having to defend
my judgment of character

25:30.141 --> 25:31.558
because of Caitlyn is bullshit.

25:31.642 --> 25:34.728
Ah, the only easy day
was yesterday.

25:34.862 --> 25:36.529
You're gonna drop
seal mottos on me?

25:36.647 --> 25:38.565
A little adversity
never hurt anyone.

25:38.699 --> 25:40.567
We'll be back on top
before you know it.

25:40.651 --> 25:41.901
Yeah.

25:42.036 --> 25:43.236
Oh, I got to take this.

25:43.370 --> 25:44.904
So I'll see you around 3:00?
Sure.

25:45.055 --> 25:47.707
- Hey.
- I just got out of polygraph.

25:47.825 --> 25:50.243
They poly'd you again
so soon?

25:50.377 --> 25:51.411
Yes.

25:51.562 --> 25:53.263
Did they ask
about the Balkans?

25:53.330 --> 25:55.582
Yes, they did.

25:55.716 --> 25:56.916
I'm worried, Arthur.

25:57.051 --> 25:58.301
I'm going to pull
a few strings

25:58.419 --> 26:00.019
and get to the bottom
of what's going on.

26:00.070 --> 26:01.604
I still know a few guys in I.G.

26:01.739 --> 26:02.739
Thank you.

26:02.840 --> 26:05.775
It's going to be
all right, Joan.

26:05.910 --> 26:07.777
I hope you're right.

26:18.405 --> 26:21.825
So did I get you
anything useful?

26:21.942 --> 26:26.112
Would you consider
a jackpot useful?

26:26.247 --> 26:29.115
- Really?
- Yes, really.

26:29.250 --> 26:31.367
Great work.

26:31.535 --> 26:33.453
Who knew serving my country
could feel so...

26:33.587 --> 26:35.371
Good?

26:35.539 --> 26:37.791
I know the feeling.

26:37.942 --> 26:39.793
What do you want me
to do next?

26:39.910 --> 26:43.463
Cultivate a deeper connection
with Mashkov.

26:43.597 --> 26:46.015
- "Deeper connection"?
- Yeah.

26:46.100 --> 26:48.134
He needs to fall
in love with you.

26:48.269 --> 26:51.471
- So he can trust me.
- Exactly.

26:51.605 --> 26:55.058
I'm seeing him later today.
I'll see what I can do.

26:55.226 --> 26:58.611
Okay. Let's meet up after.
And make sure to--

26:58.729 --> 27:01.731
Follow your protocols?
Don't I always?

28:27.363 --> 28:29.083
Incoming call--Annie.

28:29.220 --> 28:30.504
- Annie?
- Hey, Auggie.

28:30.638 --> 28:33.256
Little foot chase
got my blood pumping.

28:33.541 --> 28:35.508
- You were made.
- It's going to be fine.

28:35.626 --> 28:38.128
I had to draw Olga
away from Britta.

28:38.262 --> 28:39.879
Sure, of course you did.

28:40.014 --> 28:41.298
What does that mean?

28:41.432 --> 28:43.300
It means
you ignored my advice,

28:43.384 --> 28:45.185
and you put the mission
in jeopardy.

28:45.269 --> 28:47.654
I'm trying to complete
the mission.

28:47.722 --> 28:49.689
You are always trying
to complete the mission.

28:49.807 --> 28:51.474
That isn't the issue.
What's the issue?

28:51.559 --> 28:52.809
The one thing

28:52.944 --> 28:54.778
that an operative
and a handler need is trust,

28:54.895 --> 28:55.895
and I can't trust you.

28:56.030 --> 28:57.981
I'm doing
this mission for you.

28:58.115 --> 28:59.983
Right, but the Annie Walker
I used to know

29:00.117 --> 29:02.152
would've consulted me
before getting me protection

29:02.236 --> 29:03.486
and looping in McQuaid.

29:03.571 --> 29:05.121
This is about McQuaid?

29:05.239 --> 29:08.325
No. This is about you
and how you've changed.

29:08.409 --> 29:09.793
You're right.
I've changed.

29:09.910 --> 29:12.712
I'm not a rookie operative
anymore who needs your approval.

29:12.830 --> 29:13.997
And I think that--

29:14.081 --> 29:16.666
I think that scares you.

29:16.801 --> 29:18.468
You have no idea
what scares me.

29:18.586 --> 29:21.171
Just get the Intel
and call me back.

29:25.643 --> 29:28.361
No, I understand.
Thanks for getting back to me.

29:28.479 --> 29:31.097
- Okay, then we got this one.
- I owe you one.

29:31.232 --> 29:33.600
- What was that about?
- You.

29:33.768 --> 29:36.870
The digging I did
into your polygraph paid off.

29:36.971 --> 29:39.606
- How bad is it?
- It's not good.

29:39.774 --> 29:41.107
It's great.

29:41.192 --> 29:43.193
It turns out the Agency
is vetting you

29:43.327 --> 29:45.662
for another position--
something huge.

29:45.780 --> 29:47.697
Did he say anything else?

29:47.782 --> 29:49.699
No, that's all I know.

29:49.834 --> 29:53.119
See, polygraphs aren't always
a bad thing.

29:53.287 --> 29:55.538
Not as good as this.

30:03.798 --> 30:05.548
Hurry. We have to beat
the shift change.

30:05.683 --> 30:06.933
Why?
What's the rush?

30:07.051 --> 30:09.091
One of the current guards
on duty is from Cape Town.

30:09.103 --> 30:10.970
He likes speaking Afrikaans
with me.

30:11.105 --> 30:12.555
Hello, Thomas.

30:44.638 --> 30:47.006
- How much further?
- It's just up here.

30:47.174 --> 30:50.343
What did Belenko
have you working on?

30:50.511 --> 30:53.763
Do you know
who he's targeting next?

30:55.232 --> 30:57.100
This was a mistake.

30:57.184 --> 31:01.521
Britta, I cannot keep you safe
unless you tell me everything.

31:08.079 --> 31:09.245
Before I tell you anything,

31:09.363 --> 31:11.498
I need to know more
about the woman he killed.

31:11.615 --> 31:12.699
Why?

31:12.867 --> 31:15.785
What do you want to know?
What was her name?

31:15.870 --> 31:17.620
Caitlyn Cook.

31:17.772 --> 31:19.456
What was she like?

31:19.607 --> 31:21.124
Why are you asking me this?

31:21.275 --> 31:23.543
Tell me about her, and I'll
tell you what I'm working on.

31:23.677 --> 31:27.464
She was successful,
career-oriented...

31:27.598 --> 31:29.466
accomplished.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.434
She sounds like me.

31:31.552 --> 31:34.154
In some ways.

31:34.271 --> 31:36.356
What did she do for him?

31:36.440 --> 31:40.160
She helped him plan an attack
that killed innocent people.

31:41.445 --> 31:43.563
Why do you think she did it?

31:43.647 --> 31:45.331
I think she loved him.

31:45.399 --> 31:49.652
I think he convinced her
that he felt the same way.

31:49.787 --> 31:51.454
He gave her a wedding ring.

31:51.572 --> 31:54.157
But he was just manipulating her
to further his plan.

31:54.291 --> 31:55.771
As soon as
he didn't need her anymore,

31:55.876 --> 31:57.327
he shot her in cold blood

31:57.411 --> 32:00.163
and walked away
as if he never knew her.

32:05.719 --> 32:08.671
Did the ring look like this?

32:10.424 --> 32:11.758
Yeah.

32:17.815 --> 32:22.018
Alex promised me
that I was the love of his life.

32:22.136 --> 32:24.437
I believed him.

32:24.572 --> 32:27.023
He's using you.

32:28.509 --> 32:31.861
He's not worth protecting.

32:32.012 --> 32:35.865
I need a drink.

32:35.950 --> 32:37.951
Okay.

32:48.512 --> 32:52.348
He's meeting someone
named Shumer

32:52.466 --> 32:56.803
in Frankfurt tomorrow--
the Lindauer Hotel.

32:59.106 --> 33:00.607
What else can you tell me?

33:13.370 --> 33:16.239
You were right.

33:16.373 --> 33:18.374
I did make this for Alex.

33:22.546 --> 33:24.747
Britta!

33:24.832 --> 33:28.001
Britta?

33:28.135 --> 33:29.886
Britta?

33:30.004 --> 33:32.589
What else did you make
for Belenko?

33:32.673 --> 33:34.891
Britta?

33:35.009 --> 33:36.593
What did you make for him?

33:36.677 --> 33:38.811
Britta?
Uh...

33:44.852 --> 33:47.687
Britta, stay with me.
Just--

34:34.670 --> 34:37.540
Anderson, it's Ryan McQuaid.

34:38.303 --> 34:40.888
Pete tipped off my 20.

34:40.973 --> 34:42.389
Yeah, he did.

34:42.474 --> 34:46.060
And I thought we were friends.

34:46.195 --> 34:48.062
Uh, two more
of whatever he's having.

34:48.197 --> 34:49.730
What's your poison?

34:49.864 --> 34:52.065
Any other night, Tequila.

34:52.201 --> 34:55.152
- Tonight?
- Bourbon for Tony.

35:05.330 --> 35:07.081
Have you heard
anything from Annie?

35:07.216 --> 35:08.666
No, nothing yet.

35:08.834 --> 35:10.668
But that's
not exactly surprising,

35:10.803 --> 35:13.921
as you know,
she's a bit of a Maverick.

35:14.056 --> 35:16.757
One of her finest qualities.

35:23.899 --> 35:27.768
Look, I know what it's like
to lose a brother in arms.

35:27.903 --> 35:30.771
It makes you angry
at the world and...

35:30.856 --> 35:33.441
everyone in it.

35:33.575 --> 35:37.445
Something like that
you never quite get over.

35:37.529 --> 35:39.030
No, you don't.

35:40.916 --> 35:42.783
So let's drink to Tony.

35:47.422 --> 35:49.540
To Tony.

36:08.026 --> 36:11.229
How'd it go earlier
with Mashkov?

36:11.396 --> 36:12.480
He's already talking

36:12.564 --> 36:14.649
about taking me
to Russia someday.

36:14.783 --> 36:16.901
He wants to show me
where he grew up.

36:17.069 --> 36:21.155
You move fast. Sounds like
he's falling pretty hard.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.407
I'm only doing
what you asked.

36:23.542 --> 36:27.678
I know.
Wasn't criticizing.

36:27.796 --> 36:29.997
I'm doing this because...

36:30.132 --> 36:33.334
it feels good
to do the right thing,

36:33.468 --> 36:36.587
but I'm also doing it
for you, Calder.

36:47.599 --> 36:50.434
Mm.

36:54.823 --> 36:56.524
Ah, it's Mashkov.

36:56.658 --> 36:58.693
I'll call him later.
No, no, take that.

36:58.827 --> 37:01.362
I'd rather pick up
where we left off.

37:01.446 --> 37:02.530
Listen to me.

37:02.664 --> 37:05.783
The sooner we get what we need
out of him,

37:05.918 --> 37:09.036
the sooner we can end it.

37:11.673 --> 37:14.458
Hey, baby.

37:14.626 --> 37:16.627
You want to see me tonight?

37:19.681 --> 37:21.215
Okay.

37:21.366 --> 37:23.718
I'll meet you at my place.

37:25.187 --> 37:27.722
I can't wait either, baby.

37:27.856 --> 37:30.141
Bye.

37:39.985 --> 37:42.737
Yeah.
You better not keep him waiting.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.228
Hey, hey, hey.

38:07.346 --> 38:09.430
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

38:25.414 --> 38:27.031
I know you're not Interpol.

38:27.165 --> 38:29.116
You don't know anything.

38:39.678 --> 38:42.246
We are on the same side...

38:42.381 --> 38:44.548
Annie Walker.

38:51.773 --> 38:54.642
- You want a ride?
- Nah, it's a two-minute walk.

38:54.776 --> 38:56.811
All right, man,
see you later.

38:56.895 --> 38:58.863
- Hey, McQuaid?
- Yeah?

39:00.365 --> 39:03.818
Sorry I gave you such
a hard time about the shadow.

39:03.952 --> 39:06.821
I know you were doing
the right thing...

39:06.955 --> 39:08.656
And I appreciate it.

39:08.790 --> 39:10.991
You're welcome.
Take it easy, Auggie.

39:11.076 --> 39:13.327
Yeah, you too.

39:14.796 --> 39:17.498
Come on, Pete!
We're going home!

40:38.930 --> 40:41.379
Aah!
