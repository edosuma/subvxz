00:00.659 --> 00:02.493
<i>Previously on "Bitten"...</i>

00:02.495 --> 00:03.694
I am the lock.

00:03.695 --> 00:05.195
I am the key.

00:05.197 --> 00:08.632
Savannah: I tried to
resist, but he's too strong.

00:08.634 --> 00:12.195
I keep having this vision
that you're getting killed.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.289
A premonition of
something that will happen.

00:14.314 --> 00:15.789
Ruth: The Undoing has begun.

00:15.814 --> 00:19.000
Unless we kill him by sunrise,
all the witches will be dead.

00:19.025 --> 00:20.591
Jeremy: What will the spell accomplish?

00:20.593 --> 00:22.293
Ruth: It will kill Aleister.

00:22.295 --> 00:24.495
I just hope it does so in time.

00:24.497 --> 00:25.930
If your abilities as a werewolf

00:25.932 --> 00:28.399
are becoming erratic or uncontrollable,

00:28.401 --> 00:30.501
it must mean that as we are dying...

00:30.503 --> 00:32.302
The werewolf curse is lifted.

00:32.305 --> 00:34.172
Well, looky here.

00:34.174 --> 00:35.472
Zachary Cain?

00:35.474 --> 00:37.040
I just got off the phone with Nick.

00:37.042 --> 00:38.975
Come tomorrow, we won't
be able to Change anymore.

00:38.977 --> 00:40.377
Cain: Jeremy, you just
point me in the direction

00:40.379 --> 00:41.612
of what needs killing.

00:41.614 --> 00:44.448
I want Ruth. Tell me where she is!

00:44.450 --> 00:45.782
(Snarling)

00:46.918 --> 00:48.151
(Roaring)

00:48.153 --> 00:49.353
Rachel: (Screaming)

00:49.355 --> 00:50.554
(Panting)

00:50.556 --> 00:52.756
They're too deep.

00:52.758 --> 00:54.557
Logan, don't leave me!

00:54.559 --> 00:55.959
(Crying) Logan!

00:55.961 --> 00:57.894
Ruth: I need to be where
I can harness the power

00:57.896 --> 00:59.930
of the Coven leaders who came before me.

00:59.932 --> 01:01.064
The catacombs.

01:02.133 --> 01:03.566
There's only one way

01:03.568 --> 01:06.169
Ruth can manifest the power she
needs for this type of magic.

01:06.171 --> 01:07.403
I know where she's gone.

01:07.405 --> 01:09.205
Let's finish this.

01:12.509 --> 01:15.545
(Distorted, high-pitched effects)

01:15.547 --> 01:17.146
(Groaning in pain)

01:19.816 --> 01:22.385
(Panting, wheezing)

01:22.387 --> 01:23.819
Clay: It's okay...

01:26.389 --> 01:27.689
- Argh!
- Is he okay?

01:27.691 --> 01:28.890
It's the first wave of the Change.

01:28.892 --> 01:30.158
He's caught in the pain.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.594
Cain: It's affecting all of us.

01:32.596 --> 01:34.162
Oh, save your strength, sweetheart.

01:34.164 --> 01:35.597
How are you alive?

01:35.599 --> 01:36.865
We came to an understanding.

01:36.867 --> 01:39.134
I'm with you on this, all right?

01:39.136 --> 01:40.469
One with the Pack.

01:41.536 --> 01:44.939
Did you reach Logan? Is he coming?

01:48.043 --> 01:50.879
Logan was with me at Stonehaven.

01:50.881 --> 01:53.514
Aleister attacked us,
he was looking for Ruth.

01:55.785 --> 01:57.351
Jeremy, what happened?

01:57.353 --> 01:58.919
He fought very bravely.

02:00.355 --> 02:01.722
The wound was terrible.

02:01.724 --> 02:03.056
What are you saying?

02:04.393 --> 02:06.260
Logan is dead.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.531
No...

02:12.768 --> 02:15.135
Logan died with Rachel by his side.

02:15.137 --> 02:16.503
(Pained whimpering)

02:18.606 --> 02:21.641
(Gasping) Nick...

02:21.643 --> 02:24.477
Jeremy: She's still back at Stonehaven.

02:24.479 --> 02:25.879
We have to see this through,

02:25.881 --> 02:28.415
and then we will go back
and we will bury him.

02:28.417 --> 02:29.716
Aleister's inside. Where?

02:29.718 --> 02:31.451
Ruth started a spell to kill Aleister.

02:31.453 --> 02:33.219
He's going to try to find her and stop it.

02:33.221 --> 02:35.021
Paige: She'll be in our sacred ritual room,

02:35.023 --> 02:36.790
in the catacombs beneath the building.

02:36.792 --> 02:38.725
- (Panting)
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.295
- Are you all right?
- (Groan)

02:42.297 --> 02:44.631
Elena, are you okay?

02:44.633 --> 02:46.466
Elena's voice: Dead by dawn.

02:46.468 --> 02:48.234
I am dead by dawn.
Savannah: (Screaming)

02:50.737 --> 02:52.538
None of us are okay.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.407
If we don't stop the Undoing,

02:55.409 --> 02:57.076
we'll never be all right again.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.548
(Groaning, choking)

03:04.217 --> 03:06.752

Paige: To get to the ritual room,

03:45.740 --> 03:46.939
you need to be with me.

03:46.941 --> 03:48.140
The entrance to the boiler room

03:48.142 --> 03:50.375
will only open to a Coven witch.

03:50.377 --> 03:51.510
(Moaning)

03:52.945 --> 03:55.080
Okay, hold on a sec, here, all right?

03:55.282 --> 03:57.282
'Cause we're in a cat box full of crap.

03:57.784 --> 04:00.919
Your lives, our existence,
is all on the line.

04:00.921 --> 04:03.422
I just want to get one
thing straight, okay?

04:03.424 --> 04:05.890
If this young witch is the bomb mechanism

04:05.892 --> 04:08.226
to this whole... Undoing...

04:08.228 --> 04:10.161
If she's in there...

04:10.163 --> 04:12.030
can't we just, you know, snuff her?

04:12.032 --> 04:14.899
No! She's innocent.

04:14.901 --> 04:17.201
None of this is her fault.

04:17.202 --> 04:18.670
Well, there's a lot of innocent people

04:18.672 --> 04:20.105
who are going to die if
we don't end this quickly.

04:20.107 --> 04:22.039
Hey, you want to fight for us?

04:22.041 --> 04:25.476
Aleister is our target. Not Savannah!

04:25.478 --> 04:28.012
End of conversation.

04:30.715 --> 04:32.583
Nick: (Screaming)

04:32.585 --> 04:34.018
Jeremy: Go, go with them.

04:35.654 --> 04:37.788
You need to fight through
the Change, now. We have to go.

04:37.790 --> 04:39.123
Don't worry about me.

04:39.125 --> 04:41.458
I'm going in there, but I can't Change.

04:41.460 --> 04:44.394
Not if it means I can't Change get back.

04:44.396 --> 04:48.098
I went to Hawkesbury. I saw my mother.

04:48.100 --> 04:49.700
And now I know how much she loved Antonio

04:49.702 --> 04:51.068
and I want that!

04:51.070 --> 04:53.770
I want what Clay and Elena have.

04:53.772 --> 04:55.372
What Logan had.

04:55.374 --> 04:58.175
And I... I can't do that as a wolf.

04:58.177 --> 04:59.809
(Groaning)

05:03.347 --> 05:07.016
Fight the Change, Nick. Fight the Change.

05:07.018 --> 05:10.452
Aleister's put a spell on the doors.

05:10.454 --> 05:12.055
Paige: So don't touch them.

05:12.057 --> 05:13.455
(Chuckling) Spell...

05:13.457 --> 05:14.657
Can he spell "suck it"?

05:14.659 --> 05:16.959
Touch them, and you die.

05:16.961 --> 05:18.561
Can you do anything?

05:20.898 --> 05:22.231
(Grunting)

05:24.534 --> 05:27.069
(Shattering)

05:33.243 --> 05:35.377

- Yeah.

Paige.

05:44.321 --> 05:53.962
(♪)

05:53.964 --> 05:56.264
If you're trying to kill me, Ruth,

05:56.266 --> 05:58.867
you'll have to hurry!

05:58.869 --> 06:00.768
It's almost dawn.

06:00.770 --> 06:02.169

06:31.967 --> 06:33.867
That bitch.

06:33.869 --> 06:35.736
We have to hurry.

06:35.738 --> 06:38.305
Paige.

06:38.307 --> 06:40.206
What is it?

06:40.208 --> 06:41.975
She's in the building.

06:41.977 --> 06:43.477
Deal with it, Aleister.

06:43.479 --> 06:46.045
Keep your sister busy,
while we kill your mother.

06:47.114 --> 06:49.149

Hey, where to?

07:03.899 --> 07:05.731
Get off me, Wolf.

07:05.733 --> 07:06.932
Paige?

07:06.934 --> 07:08.133
- You vile...
- Gun!

07:08.135 --> 07:09.902
(Gunshots)

07:09.904 --> 07:14.507
(♪)

07:14.509 --> 07:15.708
Stay here.

07:15.710 --> 07:17.810

07:17.812 --> 07:19.011
(Grunting, yelling)

07:19.013 --> 07:20.346

07:22.182 --> 07:24.582
Jeremy: Hey!

07:24.584 --> 07:25.717
(Grunt)

07:27.153 --> 07:29.054
He is the One true path.

07:29.056 --> 07:30.455
(Vertebrae crunch)

07:30.457 --> 07:31.857
Aleister has control of the guards.

07:31.859 --> 07:33.058
You need to fight. You okay?

07:33.060 --> 07:34.332
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

07:34.333 --> 07:35.333
Yeah.

07:36.162 --> 07:37.696
Dammit. Come on!

07:41.233 --> 07:43.067
How do we get to Ruth from here?

07:43.069 --> 07:45.570
If you try and stop him, he will kill you.

07:45.572 --> 07:46.771
(Gasp)

07:46.773 --> 07:48.105
Hey.

07:49.742 --> 07:51.476
(Groaning)

07:51.478 --> 07:53.945
Savannah showed you her premonition.

07:53.947 --> 07:55.146
You're rushing

07:55.148 --> 07:57.414
straight into the arms of your own death.

07:59.584 --> 08:00.584
We have to get back up.

08:00.586 --> 08:02.386
That's key card only, bro.

08:02.388 --> 08:04.255
Ah, there's gotta be stairs.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.825
In case you didn't notice, we're not armed.

08:11.827 --> 08:13.659
They are. I know you showed me mercy,

08:13.661 --> 08:15.428
but it doesn't mean I'm
gonna take a bullet for you.

08:15.430 --> 08:17.096
Your life is your own. Do what you want.

08:17.098 --> 08:18.531
I have to find Elena.

08:18.533 --> 08:19.956
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

08:19.981 --> 08:22.199
Hold up! All right?

08:22.712 --> 08:24.345
She's not waiting around up there.

08:24.347 --> 08:25.880
They're looking for the boiler room.

08:25.882 --> 08:28.049
You want to find her, we've got to go down.

08:31.519 --> 08:37.024
(♪)

08:37.025 --> 08:38.960
You okay? Can you still fight the Change?

08:38.962 --> 08:41.328
It's only an hour till dawn. I got this.

08:43.496 --> 08:45.566
- You all right?
- Yeah.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.267
You smell that?

08:47.269 --> 08:48.469
Humans.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.239
Where's it coming from?

08:55.276 --> 08:56.743
Right here.

08:56.746 --> 08:59.481

09:18.699 --> 09:20.433

10:09.848 --> 10:12.416
Where is Ruth?

10:12.418 --> 10:14.285
Go into your blood.

10:14.287 --> 10:17.288
Sense the power rising through the floor.

10:17.290 --> 10:19.724
The secret ritual chambers are below us.

10:19.726 --> 10:21.159
There's only one way in.

10:21.161 --> 10:23.861
She thinks she can kill me?

10:23.863 --> 10:26.297
She's failed at that at least once before.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.934
Aleister: (Strained grunt)

10:30.936 --> 10:32.903
Only a Coven witch can open it.

10:35.940 --> 10:37.974
(Gasping)

10:40.912 --> 10:43.580
Aleister: Savannah, open the door.

10:43.582 --> 10:45.415
Take us to Ruth!

10:45.417 --> 10:46.983
Lock her down again while
she has her talisman.

10:46.985 --> 10:48.919
She's a shell, even with her talisman.

10:48.921 --> 10:50.120
And once we cross that threshold,

10:50.122 --> 10:51.321
we have no idea how the powers

10:51.323 --> 10:52.723
of the Coven will affect her.

10:52.725 --> 10:54.891
Savannah, I am the lock.

10:54.893 --> 10:57.094
(Mixed whispers)

10:57.096 --> 10:59.696
And I am the key.

10:59.698 --> 11:01.364
Ruth's here.

11:07.638 --> 11:09.505
(Growling) Good!

Nick!

11:58.553 --> 11:59.687
Hello, mother...

12:01.857 --> 12:03.524
I've come home.

12:10.077 --> 12:12.512
You got my message.

12:12.514 --> 12:15.115
Loud and clear.

12:15.117 --> 12:17.117
I have a few tricks of my own.

12:19.153 --> 12:21.387
Your little Savannah let us in.

12:23.323 --> 12:25.258
Savannah, listen to me.

12:25.260 --> 12:26.760
They are going to kill you,

12:26.762 --> 12:29.528
and Clara is going to take
possession of your body.

12:29.530 --> 12:31.330
She's gone, mother,

12:31.332 --> 12:33.599
under a deep ocean of calm.

12:33.601 --> 12:35.969
It's a place I had to go to many times

12:35.971 --> 12:37.637
when my father beat me.

12:37.639 --> 12:40.406
I didn't intend for your
life to be so full of pain.

12:40.408 --> 12:43.175
You never intended for
me to have a life at all.

12:44.578 --> 12:47.946
But these powers you gave
me, they came in handy.

12:47.948 --> 12:51.317
I killed that man. He wasn't my father.

12:53.286 --> 12:56.321
Do you even know who was, whore?

12:56.323 --> 12:58.991
Come and say that to my face.

12:58.993 --> 13:00.392
Don't get too close!

13:00.394 --> 13:01.794
If she gets your blood in that bowl,

13:01.796 --> 13:03.295
you'll be dead in seconds.

13:05.999 --> 13:07.833
She won't break the Circle.

13:07.835 --> 13:09.934
It's the only thing protecting her.

13:11.771 --> 13:13.738
(Grunts, gasps)

13:13.740 --> 13:15.206
- <i>Occide fil...
- Drag her out!</i>

13:15.208 --> 13:16.608
- (Groaning)
- (Yelp)

13:16.610 --> 13:18.610
You shouldn't have broken the Circle, Ruth!

13:18.612 --> 13:21.546
And now you're going to die, mother...

13:21.548 --> 13:23.481
along with all the rest of them.

13:25.351 --> 13:27.151
<i>Occide matrim.</i>

13:30.555 --> 13:32.489
We have to get to Ruth.

13:32.491 --> 13:33.925
(Roaring)

13:33.927 --> 13:37.929
(Distorted voice) Why rush to
your death if I could do it now?

13:37.931 --> 13:40.798
Paige... (Grunting)

13:40.800 --> 13:42.733
listen to yourself.

13:42.735 --> 13:44.702
Aleister has you under a spell.

13:44.704 --> 13:45.902
This isn't you.

13:45.904 --> 13:47.671
<i>This is me...</i>

13:47.673 --> 13:49.005
killing you.

13:50.809 --> 13:53.344
(Grunting, snarling)

13:55.947 --> 13:58.248
Paige, look at me.

13:58.250 --> 13:59.449
Focus!

13:59.451 --> 14:01.952
(Groaning, snarling)

14:04.688 --> 14:06.189
(Deep, unearthly voice) Get off me, bitch!

14:06.191 --> 14:07.457
Listen to me. Do you understand?

14:07.459 --> 14:09.525
He's going to kill your mother.

14:09.527 --> 14:11.761
(Yell)

14:11.763 --> 14:13.830
<i>Occide...</i>

14:13.832 --> 14:19.635
(♪)

14:19.637 --> 14:20.970
Think about Ruth...

14:22.706 --> 14:24.841
How much you love her.

14:24.843 --> 14:26.308
Think about the Coven.

14:28.512 --> 14:30.045
(Silent choking)

14:30.047 --> 14:31.313
(Gasping)

14:31.315 --> 14:33.182
You can't let Aleister win.

14:34.885 --> 14:37.219
You're stronger than him.

14:37.221 --> 14:38.888
You can fight this.

14:38.890 --> 14:42.624
(Yelling, gasping)

14:50.366 --> 14:52.768
(Sobbing) What happened?

14:52.770 --> 14:53.968
How did we get here?

14:53.970 --> 14:56.571
Aleister had you.

14:56.573 --> 14:57.706
Hey...

15:01.377 --> 15:02.611
are you back?

15:02.613 --> 15:04.212
- Yeah?
- (Panting)

15:04.214 --> 15:05.613
- Okay.
- Yeah.

15:05.615 --> 15:07.916
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

15:07.918 --> 15:10.451
- Okay.
- (Mumbling)

15:18.827 --> 15:20.228
Elena: Take me to Ruth.

15:21.663 --> 15:23.330
Nothing's happening.

15:23.332 --> 15:26.734
You have no power down here.

15:26.736 --> 15:27.935
Kill her!

15:27.937 --> 15:29.136
(In Latin)

15:29.138 --> 15:32.306
(Effort grunts)

15:36.077 --> 15:37.545
(Panicked gasps)

15:37.547 --> 15:45.785
(♪)

15:45.787 --> 15:47.120
You failed.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.257
I failed 30 years ago.

15:50.259 --> 15:53.726
You failed because you are a coward.

15:53.728 --> 15:55.762
You couldn't do the one
thing you were supposed to

15:55.764 --> 15:58.030
to save your beloved witches.

15:58.032 --> 15:59.899
That wasn't my failure.

15:59.901 --> 16:02.401
No, I could have protected you.

16:02.403 --> 16:05.137
I should have protected you.

16:06.774 --> 16:08.441
You could have loved me.

16:10.978 --> 16:12.378
I'm sorry, my son.

16:12.380 --> 16:13.980
Are you going to believe her?

16:13.982 --> 16:15.348
She demanded that I kill you!

16:15.350 --> 16:16.648
She's trying to trick you.

16:16.650 --> 16:18.217
It didn't have to be this way.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.521
You're not sorry for what you did.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.423
You're sorry that I survived.

16:28.828 --> 16:30.095
It's locked! Dammit!

16:30.097 --> 16:32.030
Wait, wait, wait, wait, think, okay?

16:32.032 --> 16:34.566
We can probably heave those two
phone booths through this window.

16:34.568 --> 16:36.468
If we go outside, we're back to square one.

16:36.470 --> 16:38.303
At least we're not stuck in here.

16:38.305 --> 16:40.305
You want to find your girl or not?

16:41.808 --> 16:43.141
All right.

16:45.911 --> 16:48.446
(Gunshots)

16:51.917 --> 16:53.818
I'm not the greatest at math,

16:53.820 --> 16:56.121
but this feels a whole lot like square one.

16:56.123 --> 17:06.430
(♪)

17:06.432 --> 17:08.265
Paige: (Coughing)

17:09.734 --> 17:11.068
Are you okay?

17:12.369 --> 17:14.771
- Paige!
- (Groaning)

17:14.773 --> 17:17.207
Hey. Come on.

17:28.619 --> 17:31.422
(Metal creaking)

17:32.957 --> 17:34.290
(Effort gasp)

17:34.292 --> 17:36.660
Is it that close to dawn?

17:36.662 --> 17:38.628
Paige, you've got to get us in there.

17:43.200 --> 17:46.135
(Mixed eerie whispers)

17:46.137 --> 17:47.470
(Hinges screech)

17:49.540 --> 17:51.174
Can you keep it open for the others?

17:51.176 --> 17:53.342
No. It'll close once we're through.

17:56.746 --> 17:58.614
Okay, wait here.

17:58.616 --> 18:00.883
You're going to have to let them in.

18:00.885 --> 18:02.618
What are you going to do?

18:02.620 --> 18:05.521
I'm going to finish it.

18:05.523 --> 18:06.789
No, Elena...

18:08.692 --> 18:12.027
I know that you're going
to do whatever it takes...

18:12.029 --> 18:14.463
to kill Aleister.

18:14.465 --> 18:16.164
But if you can't...

18:18.935 --> 18:22.137
Savannah's the conduit.

18:22.139 --> 18:23.638
If you end the Undoing,

18:23.640 --> 18:25.907
we will have a fighting chance
to take him down, together.

18:28.111 --> 18:30.479
I'm not saying that this is right,

18:30.481 --> 18:32.280
or that it'll be easy.

18:32.282 --> 18:33.781
But if it comes to this...

18:34.950 --> 18:38.487
you have to be prepared
to sacrifice Savannah.

18:44.827 --> 18:54.502
(♪)

18:59.047 --> 19:01.080
(Gunshot) (Gasping)

19:01.082 --> 19:02.982
Clay: Keep him distracted.
I'm going to Change.

19:02.984 --> 19:04.250
I can take him down.

19:04.252 --> 19:05.452
What if you can't Change back?

19:05.454 --> 19:06.787
I have to take the chance!

19:06.789 --> 19:08.888
Yeah, but then you'll never be with Elena.

19:08.890 --> 19:11.157
All right? And being without
the one you love the most,

19:11.159 --> 19:13.327
for guys like us, that's
the worst pain in the world.

19:13.329 --> 19:15.128
Believe me, Clay,

19:15.130 --> 19:17.130
it ain't no life to live.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.366
(Gun clicking on empty chamber)

19:23.270 --> 19:25.404
So whatever you do,

19:25.406 --> 19:26.840
just never let her go.

19:26.842 --> 19:28.274
What are you doing?

19:28.276 --> 19:30.343
I'm going to go get
that mall cop's key card.

19:31.611 --> 19:35.614
(♪)

19:35.616 --> 19:38.183
(Gunshots)

19:38.185 --> 19:47.660
(♪)

19:47.662 --> 19:48.794
Ugh!

19:50.563 --> 19:51.696
(Grunting)

19:53.867 --> 19:55.200
Cain!

19:58.171 --> 20:00.705
(Groaning)

20:02.775 --> 20:04.243
Look what I got.

20:08.581 --> 20:10.582
You better make this worth it, bro.

20:13.173 --> 20:16.709
Hey. Go get her.

20:25.397 --> 20:27.398
These things I've done,

20:27.400 --> 20:30.134
the years of pain.

20:30.136 --> 20:33.070
My boy.

20:33.072 --> 20:34.538
There's still time.

20:34.540 --> 20:36.407
We can unwind it all.

20:36.409 --> 20:39.343
I can take away all the hurt.

20:44.682 --> 20:46.750
Clara: Don't listen to her.

20:46.752 --> 20:48.752
She's lying.

20:48.754 --> 20:50.788
Stop this.

20:50.790 --> 20:54.024
You were just trying to buy time.

20:54.026 --> 20:55.659
- (Grunt)
- Ahh!

20:55.661 --> 20:56.927
Aleister!

20:56.929 --> 20:58.194
(Grunting)

20:58.196 --> 20:59.529
(Clinking)

21:00.631 --> 21:02.465
I will bleed the life from you, wolf.

21:02.467 --> 21:04.200
You're not holding me back.

21:04.202 --> 21:07.137
You don't have any power in here, do you?

21:07.139 --> 21:08.704
Savannah?

21:08.706 --> 21:10.740
Savannah, listen to me.
He's controlling you,

21:10.742 --> 21:12.409
but you're stronger than him.

21:12.411 --> 21:14.710
I am the lock.

21:14.712 --> 21:17.346
And I am the key.

21:17.348 --> 21:19.248
Aleister: She's gone, Elena.

21:19.250 --> 21:20.683
Drowning in your blood.

21:20.685 --> 21:23.385
And there is nothing
you can do to save her.

21:23.387 --> 21:24.787
(Grunt of anger)

21:24.789 --> 21:39.734
(♪)

21:44.441 --> 21:46.975
(Fighting grunts continue)

21:50.813 --> 21:52.380
Clara: The athame. Here!

21:52.382 --> 21:53.715
Aleister: (Gasp)

21:55.050 --> 21:56.384
- (Grunting)
- (Groan)

21:56.386 --> 21:58.353
(Gasping)

21:58.355 --> 22:05.393
(♪)

22:05.395 --> 22:06.894
In the end,

22:06.896 --> 22:09.130
you die protecting them,

22:09.132 --> 22:10.664
and because of them.

22:10.666 --> 22:14.035
Their athame. Your blood. Ah!

22:14.037 --> 22:16.570
(Pained moans)

22:21.009 --> 22:22.610
This isn't the end.

22:22.612 --> 22:24.311
I'm sorry, Savannah.

22:24.313 --> 22:27.147
This is the only way. Ugh!

22:27.149 --> 22:29.316
(Panting with effort)

22:31.753 --> 22:32.887
(Grunt)

22:35.523 --> 22:37.324

(Panting)

22:56.677 --> 22:59.612
Elena, what is happening?

22:59.614 --> 23:01.748
They can't control you.

23:03.183 --> 23:04.984
No. We have to go.

23:04.986 --> 23:07.186
- No!
- Quickly!

23:07.188 --> 23:08.387
No!

23:08.389 --> 23:09.788
Let me go!

23:09.790 --> 23:10.923
Stop!

23:12.792 --> 23:15.694
(Gasping)

23:19.832 --> 23:22.068

23:22.070 --> 23:23.335

Ugh!

24:15.520 --> 24:18.054
(Sobbing painfully)

24:19.890 --> 24:21.091
Elena?

(Panting)

24:23.061 --> 24:24.394
Elena!

24:28.399 --> 24:29.733
You hang on, okay?

24:29.735 --> 24:31.868
Okay, I'm going to get you out of here.

24:35.006 --> 24:38.074
Go to him. There's no time.

24:38.076 --> 24:40.076
I'm not leaving you.

24:40.078 --> 24:42.545
(Sobbing and panting)

24:42.547 --> 24:56.559
(♪)

24:56.561 --> 24:59.228
I love you so much.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.587
Elena?

25:25.589 --> 25:28.022
Say something!

25:28.024 --> 25:29.157
Say something!

25:37.265 --> 25:39.734

25:42.760 --> 25:57.906

26:07.619 --> 26:09.018
Paige: Nick!

26:09.020 --> 26:10.153
Nick: Paige!

26:12.022 --> 26:13.423
We've got to get out of here.

26:13.425 --> 26:14.624
No, I'll let you in.

26:14.626 --> 26:16.193
- We can go together.
- Listen to me...

26:16.195 --> 26:17.704
- Clay and Elena are in there.
- I open this door,

26:17.729 --> 26:18.641
they're coming through.

26:18.666 --> 26:20.420
I don't know how long I can hold them, go.

26:20.445 --> 26:21.596
- But...
- Please.

26:21.886 --> 26:23.219
Just do this for me.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.367
(Mixed eerie whispers)

26:34.784 --> 26:38.587
(Eerie music)

26:38.964 --> 26:40.096
Nick?

26:41.972 --> 26:43.106
Nick!

26:48.415 --> 26:51.150
Clay: (Sobbing)

26:51.152 --> 26:53.452
I'm so sorry.

26:53.454 --> 26:55.787
I'm sorry I couldn't get to you, darlin'.

26:58.491 --> 26:59.825
Paige: Mother!

27:05.197 --> 27:08.934
(Heavy breathing)

27:17.176 --> 27:18.209
Clay?

27:18.211 --> 27:20.811
Where is he? Where's Aleister?

27:20.813 --> 27:23.548
He's taken Savannah
deep into the catacombs.

27:26.519 --> 27:28.686
And that's where I'll kill him.

27:28.687 --> 27:30.154
Are you going to Change?

27:30.157 --> 27:33.024
There's no reason for
me to stay human anymore.

28:04.555 --> 28:05.889
Jeremy!

28:11.730 --> 28:13.730
(Struggling)

28:13.732 --> 28:15.331
Jeremy: Back away.

28:32.416 --> 28:33.649
(Door slam)

28:33.651 --> 28:37.019
(Punching thuds) (Muffled pained groans)

28:44.728 --> 28:45.961
What are you doing?

28:45.963 --> 28:47.262
I'm doing what must be done, Paige.

28:47.264 --> 28:48.931
You don't have the strength to do this.

28:48.933 --> 28:50.398
This is the strongest thing I can do.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.234
It's all I have left to fight him with.

28:52.236 --> 28:54.603
Please. There must be another way.

28:54.605 --> 28:56.037
Not for me.

28:56.039 --> 28:57.939
This is all because of me, my failures.

28:57.941 --> 28:59.941
I have to make at least
this one thing right.

28:59.943 --> 29:01.943
No, I won't let you.

29:01.945 --> 29:04.246
The ring is already on her.

29:04.248 --> 29:08.950
It's already started. Accept this.

29:08.952 --> 29:13.121
And understand it's because I love you.

29:13.123 --> 29:14.255
Mom...

29:15.523 --> 29:30.671
(♪)

29:31.973 --> 29:36.377
<i>Spiritus, ostende mihi viam...</i>

29:36.379 --> 29:38.646
No. Please, I need you.

29:38.648 --> 29:41.815
Mom, mom, I need you.

29:41.817 --> 29:45.718
<i>Spiritus, revive.</i>

29:45.720 --> 29:47.053
(Panting)

29:50.958 --> 29:52.826
Aleister: (Gasping with pain)

29:52.828 --> 29:54.828
Let me go!

29:54.830 --> 29:56.963
There's no way out. Oh, God.

29:59.167 --> 30:00.833
She's out of the spell.

30:00.835 --> 30:02.468
I have her talisman.

30:02.470 --> 30:05.371
What can she do? Move a glass? Slam a door?

30:05.373 --> 30:08.007
I will make you suffer

30:08.009 --> 30:09.842
for what you did to Elena.

30:09.844 --> 30:11.678
She had to pay, Savannah.

30:11.680 --> 30:13.513
For her defiance.

30:13.515 --> 30:15.315
As will you. (Chuckling)

30:15.317 --> 30:17.850
You won't live long past sunrise.

30:17.852 --> 30:20.019
Once daylight breaks through the ceiling,

30:20.021 --> 30:21.320
the Undoing will be over.

30:21.322 --> 30:22.721
The witches will be dead,

30:22.723 --> 30:23.989
there will be no one to save you.

30:23.991 --> 30:25.524
And I will possess your body.

30:25.526 --> 30:27.860
No.

30:27.862 --> 30:30.196
I won't let you in.

30:30.198 --> 30:32.397
You'll fight it, Savannah.

30:32.399 --> 30:33.865
But you will lose.

30:33.867 --> 30:36.034
As well as the rest of Elena's family.

30:36.036 --> 30:39.705
Once I have your powers,
I intend to kill them.

30:39.707 --> 30:41.340
I can't have them getting in the way

30:41.342 --> 30:44.943
of all the fun I'm going to have.

30:44.945 --> 30:47.312
I promise I'll take good care of your body.

30:47.314 --> 30:48.880
(Laughing)

30:48.882 --> 30:51.049
(Chuckling)

30:51.051 --> 30:52.783
- (Roaring)
- (Gasping)

30:55.554 --> 30:57.421
(Snarling)

30:57.423 --> 31:01.759
<i>Spiritus, revive. Come on, Elena.</i>

31:01.761 --> 31:03.094
(Sharp gasp)

31:05.264 --> 31:06.897
Aaaggh!

31:06.899 --> 31:10.568
(Struggling)

31:10.570 --> 31:11.902
Mom!

31:12.904 --> 31:14.739
Mom, I am not ready for this.

31:14.741 --> 31:16.907
I'm not ready for this, mom!

31:16.909 --> 31:19.209
- No...
- (Moaning, gasping)

31:21.279 --> 31:22.412
Mom...

31:25.250 --> 31:27.184
(Whispering) You will shine.

31:29.754 --> 31:32.689
(Eerie effects)

31:32.691 --> 31:36.293
(♪)

31:36.295 --> 31:38.195
(Crying)

31:41.298 --> 31:43.833
Mom! Mom!

31:48.606 --> 31:51.140
(Gasping)

31:56.280 --> 31:58.781
- She brought you back.
- Huh?

31:58.783 --> 32:00.149
You were dead, Elena.

32:05.789 --> 32:07.456
Can you save her?

32:11.928 --> 32:13.529
(Sobbing)

32:13.531 --> 32:23.972
(♪)

32:23.974 --> 32:25.307
Thank you.

32:29.145 --> 32:32.513
Clay was here when I died.

32:32.515 --> 32:34.515
He went after Aleister.

32:34.517 --> 32:35.817
As a wolf.

32:35.819 --> 32:37.152
Where?

32:43.525 --> 32:45.460
(Sobbing)

32:45.462 --> 32:57.371
(♪)

32:57.373 --> 32:58.773
Thank you.

32:58.775 --> 33:00.942
- (Snarling)
- No... (In Latin)

33:02.543 --> 33:03.743
(Roaring)

33:03.745 --> 33:06.480
(Growling)

33:06.482 --> 33:09.850
How do I have my power again?

33:09.852 --> 33:12.353
The catacombs are not protected

33:12.355 --> 33:15.189
if the Coven leader is dead.

33:15.191 --> 33:17.991
- Ruth!
- Ohh...

33:17.993 --> 33:21.194
If Ruth is dead, it must be dawn.

33:21.196 --> 33:22.596
Then where is the light?

33:22.598 --> 33:24.397
(Growling)

33:24.399 --> 33:25.599
Ah...

33:25.601 --> 33:26.933
(Roaring)

33:35.042 --> 33:37.176
(Moaning)

33:40.881 --> 33:42.581
(Panting)

33:42.583 --> 33:43.883
(Growling)

33:43.885 --> 33:45.218
(Roaring)

33:46.820 --> 33:48.421
(Eerie effects)

33:48.423 --> 33:49.989
(Snarling)

33:51.424 --> 33:53.592
(Whimpering)

33:53.594 --> 33:55.594
(Moaning)

33:55.596 --> 33:56.795
Savannah!

33:56.797 --> 33:59.264
<i>Dies courtati!</i>

33:59.266 --> 34:01.834
Oh...!

34:01.836 --> 34:03.602
(Choking)

34:06.840 --> 34:08.172
(Liquid squishing)

34:11.377 --> 34:13.110
(Gurgling)

34:15.481 --> 34:17.715
(Gasping)

34:17.717 --> 34:21.286
Aleister: I didn't think you had it in you.

34:21.288 --> 34:23.922
You heard Clara... Ahh!

34:23.924 --> 34:25.757
If Ruth is dead,

34:25.759 --> 34:27.625
the Undoing is already here.

34:27.627 --> 34:29.561
(Grunt)

34:29.563 --> 34:30.628
Ah!

34:30.630 --> 34:33.264
I have no more use for you, Savannah.

34:33.266 --> 34:35.934
This is the way the world ends.

34:35.936 --> 34:38.436
Both: (Struggling)

34:38.438 --> 34:43.107
(♪)

34:43.109 --> 34:44.775
You going to fight me, Savannah?

34:44.777 --> 34:45.976
(Moaning)

34:45.978 --> 34:57.120
(♪)

34:57.121 --> 34:58.521
- (Groaning)
- (Grunting)

34:58.523 --> 34:59.723
Ugh!

34:59.725 --> 35:01.625
(Gasping, coughing)

35:03.127 --> 35:05.128
(Heavy breathing)

35:05.130 --> 35:06.730
(Choking)

35:06.732 --> 35:09.666
You were dead.

35:09.668 --> 35:11.301
You were wrong.

35:11.303 --> 35:14.304
So fitting that it comes down to us.

35:14.306 --> 35:16.139
The only male witch.

35:16.141 --> 35:18.808
The only female werewolf.

35:18.810 --> 35:20.543
You put up a good fight.

35:20.545 --> 35:23.513
But all good things must come to an end.

35:23.515 --> 35:25.515
They will.

35:25.517 --> 35:27.049
Right now.

35:27.051 --> 35:28.384
<i>Desiste!</i>

35:29.886 --> 35:32.154
Ugh!

35:32.156 --> 35:33.489
(Clinking)

35:34.691 --> 35:35.992
(Grunting)

35:35.994 --> 35:38.160
(Muffled bubbling)

35:38.162 --> 35:40.763
(Dramatic string music)

35:40.765 --> 35:54.175
(♪)

35:54.177 --> 35:57.378
(Muffled heartbeat)

36:01.350 --> 36:04.084
(Heartbeat slowing down)

36:11.726 --> 36:14.261
(Silence)

36:24.501 --> 36:26.035
Savannah: The daylight.

36:26.036 --> 36:28.503
Elena, it's dawn.

36:28.505 --> 36:29.904
I don't know if I killed him in time

36:29.906 --> 36:31.038
to stop the Undoing.

36:34.175 --> 36:35.509
Paige.

36:38.929 --> 36:40.263
Clay...

36:48.343 --> 36:49.676
Clay, please.

36:50.991 --> 36:53.860
I know you did this for the right reasons.

36:53.862 --> 36:56.163
That you thought all hope was gone.

36:56.165 --> 36:57.531
(Sobbing)

36:57.534 --> 37:00.000
If I didn't do this in time...

37:01.976 --> 37:03.909
If we really are lost...

37:08.119 --> 37:10.287
I'm sorry.

37:10.312 --> 37:13.146
- I'm so sorry.
- (Weak growl)

37:13.171 --> 37:16.339
You did what was right.

37:16.341 --> 37:17.674
And I love you.

37:23.580 --> 37:25.314
(Sobbing)

37:29.353 --> 37:31.020
Elena?

37:31.022 --> 37:34.523
It's dawn.

37:34.525 --> 37:36.958
I don't know if it worked, Jeremy.

37:39.529 --> 37:41.930
Have you seen Paige? If she's okay then...

37:41.932 --> 37:43.031
She let me in,

37:43.033 --> 37:45.501
but I was in the corridor when dawn broke.

37:48.538 --> 37:52.540
Everything that we have...

37:52.542 --> 37:54.376
If I'd just been one second faster,

37:54.378 --> 37:57.545
but then the light came
in, and it was dawn.

37:57.547 --> 37:59.680
What if this is it?

38:02.551 --> 38:03.885
Paige: It's done.

38:06.222 --> 38:07.555
It's over.

38:12.227 --> 38:13.428
(Moaning)

38:13.430 --> 38:15.963
(Bones, flesh creaking)

38:30.245 --> 38:33.247
Jeremy: What your mother did for Elena,

38:33.249 --> 38:35.416
for all of us...

38:35.418 --> 38:36.683
Paige: She saved us.

38:36.685 --> 38:38.085
Savannah: But she's gone.

38:38.087 --> 38:41.255
No, she's not.

38:41.257 --> 38:43.590
She's in this place,

38:43.592 --> 38:45.959
and her spirit guides us.

38:45.961 --> 38:47.894
Always.

38:47.896 --> 38:50.430
There was a time when you came to me,

38:50.432 --> 38:52.899
and I turned you away.

38:52.901 --> 38:56.603
I promise you, I will
never turn you away again.

38:56.605 --> 39:00.039
We are bound together by all of this.

39:07.448 --> 39:08.982
Let me clean this up for you.

39:08.984 --> 39:10.316
Come on.

39:14.455 --> 39:16.455
So I brought all the bodies down here,

39:16.457 --> 39:17.790
cleaned up upstairs.

39:17.792 --> 39:20.826
It's all taken care of.

39:20.828 --> 39:22.922
Your mother...

39:22.947 --> 39:24.440
I can stay.

39:24.465 --> 39:27.299
I'd like that, but you can't.

39:27.301 --> 39:31.136
We need time to heal, to build.

39:31.138 --> 39:32.471
For now.

39:35.141 --> 39:38.743
Thank you, Nick Sorrentino.

39:38.745 --> 39:40.145
Oh, I didn't do anything...

39:40.147 --> 39:42.447
But you did.

39:42.449 --> 39:44.549
You didn't know it at the time,

39:44.551 --> 39:47.652
neither of us did.

39:47.654 --> 39:52.323
But after Savannah and I bury Ruth,

39:52.325 --> 39:55.493
I will become leader of the Coven.

39:55.495 --> 39:58.029
And any chance of this...

39:58.031 --> 40:01.032
will be gone.

40:01.034 --> 40:03.067
But for a happy moment,

40:03.069 --> 40:05.503
you showed me...

40:05.505 --> 40:08.672
what love could be.

40:08.674 --> 40:10.007
And for that I thank you.

40:25.189 --> 40:26.523
Let's go.

40:41.705 --> 40:43.039
Let's get out of here.

40:45.376 --> 40:46.576
I thought this place

40:46.578 --> 40:48.010
was going to be the end of us.

40:48.012 --> 40:50.547
That's impossible, darlin'.

40:50.549 --> 40:54.717
Whatever it is, fate, magic,

40:54.719 --> 40:57.019
there is something that protects us.

41:00.190 --> 41:01.523
It's love.

41:02.993 --> 41:15.404
(♪)

41:15.406 --> 41:16.875
Savannah: It's all my fault.

41:23.003 --> 41:24.336
I did this.

41:32.421 --> 41:34.589
All this...

41:34.591 --> 41:35.924
because of me.

41:38.127 --> 41:39.460
Don't do that.

41:41.396 --> 41:44.765
Don't blame yourself.
You were under a spell.

41:44.767 --> 41:48.436
Because I let him in.

41:48.438 --> 41:49.770
You let me in too.

41:52.774 --> 41:56.076
You are powerful, Savannah.

41:57.613 --> 41:59.747
You always have a choice.

42:01.282 --> 42:03.150
Don't ever forget that.

42:03.152 --> 42:05.619
I won't.

42:05.621 --> 42:08.288
It's strange.

42:08.290 --> 42:10.090
For the first time,

42:10.092 --> 42:12.592
in what seems for a very long time...

42:13.962 --> 42:16.096
I finally feel like myself.

42:18.799 --> 42:20.967
Well then, it's nice to finally meet you.

42:23.471 --> 42:26.540
(Mixed distorted effects)

42:37.651 --> 42:39.952
(Mixed screams)
