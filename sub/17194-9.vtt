WEBVTT

00:00.347 --> 00:03.082
We have a man dead...
Alderman Stephen bartlett.

00:03.084 --> 00:04.917
I'm certain the
Alderman's farm girl

00:04.919 --> 00:06.686
knows exactly what
happened in that room,

00:06.688 --> 00:09.272
and, if Teresa Trembley doesn't know
why it happened, I can find out.

00:09.274 --> 00:12.108
This will be sent to the
family of Teresa Trembley.

00:12.110 --> 00:15.094
The world will know the
loss of hazel Turnow.

00:15.096 --> 00:18.030
You will not get
the aquaduct project

00:18.032 --> 00:20.266
unless you get Lansing
to withdraw his bid.

00:20.268 --> 00:22.601
I can adjust
my negotiation style.

00:22.603 --> 00:23.786
Who's that?!

00:23.788 --> 00:26.038
I'm the angel of darkness,
you orange bastard.

00:26.040 --> 00:29.575
You got two choices... you
can sign this paper now...

00:30.712 --> 00:33.579
Or I turn you into a
flaming scarecrow.

00:33.581 --> 00:35.298
I loved Ellen.
And I love you, too...

00:35.300 --> 00:37.333
more than any brother
I ever could've had.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074

01:27.552 --> 01:30.169
Okay.

01:30.171 --> 01:31.854
You got him? Mm-hmm.

01:34.024 --> 01:35.691
Let's set him over there.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.230
Grab this arm.

01:41.232 --> 01:43.015
Got him?

01:44.735 --> 01:46.535
He's alive.

01:46.537 --> 01:49.288
Freeman, I know the difference
between dead and drunk.

01:49.290 --> 01:52.074
Kevin. Kevin!

01:52.076 --> 01:55.077
Stand back.

02:00.083 --> 02:01.717
Goddamn it.

02:01.719 --> 02:03.636
You let me be.

02:03.638 --> 02:05.227
Mnh-mnh. We fought together
on the battlefield.

02:05.240 --> 02:06.839
We're not letting you

02:06.841 --> 02:08.640
fight this war on your own.

02:08.643 --> 02:10.842
What about a mourning period?

02:10.845 --> 02:12.478
A few days, at least.

02:12.480 --> 02:16.048
Ellen's wake was two weeks ago.

02:16.050 --> 02:19.185
No, no, that's not true.

02:19.187 --> 02:20.937
Today's march 30th.

02:20.939 --> 02:24.073
It can't be.

02:28.195 --> 02:29.578
Ellen killed herself.

02:32.082 --> 02:35.501
My wife.

02:35.503 --> 02:36.786
I found her.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.875
And then you put her to rest.

02:42.877 --> 02:45.577
For you, the real
escape is living.

02:45.579 --> 02:46.879
Welcome back.

03:04.448 --> 03:05.764
[ Piano play.

03:05.766 --> 03:07.765
I like my bitches tight

03:07.767 --> 03:10.934
even better without sight

03:10.936 --> 03:13.771
screw 'em blind,
they don't mind

03:13.773 --> 03:16.574
'cause Jacko's
king of the night

03:21.129 --> 03:22.413
I got to take a piss.

03:22.415 --> 03:24.966
Hey, take one of these
whores with you, Jenkins.

03:24.968 --> 03:26.467
They'll aim it for ya.

03:26.469 --> 03:27.835
That's what they're good for!

03:29.890 --> 03:31.924
Another.

03:31.926 --> 03:33.642
Two.

03:33.644 --> 03:36.979
I like my barkeeps to be quicker
than their tenement rats.

03:36.981 --> 03:40.399
You think I come here
for the crystal?

03:40.401 --> 03:43.936
He's useless!

03:43.938 --> 03:45.154
Hey, hey, girly, girly.

03:45.156 --> 03:46.739
Hi, there.

03:46.741 --> 03:48.991
Get me another drink, girly.

03:48.993 --> 03:50.442
There's no need for that.

03:50.444 --> 03:51.810
Yeah?

03:51.812 --> 03:52.828
Ugh! Jackass!

03:52.830 --> 03:53.829
You lazy slut.

03:53.831 --> 03:54.947
Aah! That's it!

03:54.949 --> 03:57.166
Richie, toss him. Are you okay?

03:58.319 --> 04:02.454
Sir, I would really
appreciate it... hey!

04:02.456 --> 04:04.373
I would rather stay.

04:08.128 --> 04:10.829
Ah! Ah!

04:10.831 --> 04:12.664
Ah! Aah!

04:12.666 --> 04:14.333
Oh, my God.

04:14.335 --> 04:16.435
Ah! Ahh!

04:16.437 --> 04:18.187
Agh!

04:18.189 --> 04:21.106
Ah. Ah.

04:21.108 --> 04:24.360
Ah. Ahh! Ah!

04:24.362 --> 04:27.396
Ah! Aah!

04:27.398 --> 04:29.514
Aaaaah!

04:29.516 --> 04:31.533
Ah! Ah!

04:31.535 --> 04:32.568
Ahh!

04:41.378 --> 04:43.462
Didn't realize you were up.

04:43.464 --> 04:45.914
Work don't stop
'cause the sun set.

04:49.002 --> 04:51.053
And look at you,
pulling that nightgown,

04:51.055 --> 04:53.722
like I have never seen
your nekkid butt.

04:53.724 --> 04:55.474
Mama!

04:57.144 --> 04:59.544
I would've said the
same thing yesterday,

04:59.546 --> 05:02.931
before I walked in
on you and Matthew.

05:04.550 --> 05:09.721
Don't you ever tell my husband that you saw...
oh, lord, I can't believe

05:09.723 --> 05:11.073
I'm having this
conversation. Mama!

05:11.075 --> 05:13.158
- What?!
- Promise me.

05:13.160 --> 05:16.245
You always were nervous
about your body.

05:16.247 --> 05:17.896
What you ashamed of, girl?

05:21.701 --> 05:22.785
Nothin'.

05:29.259 --> 05:31.076
'Night, mama.

05:31.078 --> 05:32.211
'Night.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.918
I know it's late, sir, and I
know how busy you are, so I do

05:39.920 --> 05:41.753
apologize for...
for keeping ya.

05:41.755 --> 05:44.356
Please, sit. Ahem.
My office is always open

05:44.358 --> 05:47.025
for the pressing concerns
of my constituents.

05:47.027 --> 05:50.562
My wife, here, her
brother Seamus Walsh?

05:50.564 --> 05:53.115
He's been in the tombs
since he got mixed up

05:53.117 --> 05:54.452
in the whole
precinct's debacle.

05:54.454 --> 05:57.071
We just hoped that you might...
you say you've got power.

05:57.073 --> 05:59.040
Well, Seamus is
a damn good fella...

05:59.042 --> 06:00.608
better than you, even,
from what I hear.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.942
General, she don't
mean that. She...

06:01.944 --> 06:03.377
if you don't have
the grit to stand up

06:03.379 --> 06:07.298
for your family,
then someone has to.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.750
My brother has talent
and spirit

06:08.752 --> 06:10.968
which is being wasted
in those blasted tombs.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.304
From what I hear,
your brother is a dolt.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.949
Sure, maybe he falls into the
Coop when he's stealing chickens.

06:17.533 --> 06:18.557
But even as a kid

06:18.682 --> 06:20.099
he always put meat
on our table.

06:20.101 --> 06:21.483
When I'm trying to free
a prisoner, Sybil,

06:21.485 --> 06:23.235
I usually avoid
naming more crimes.

06:23.237 --> 06:25.521
What's behind
the action matters,

06:25.523 --> 06:28.240
and Seamus's intent
has never been criminal.

06:28.242 --> 06:31.660
My, my, my, how you
remind me of my first love.

06:31.662 --> 06:33.028
Same persuasive spark.

06:33.030 --> 06:37.332
In honor of that long-lost young
lady, I will let Seamus walk.

06:37.334 --> 06:39.492
Why, thank you,
General Donovan.

06:39.494 --> 06:44.030
With a caveat, for ours is not a
heaven from which gifts rain.

06:44.032 --> 06:45.665
The lads are digging
new sewer line uptown.

06:45.667 --> 06:49.652
If Seamus can hold his own in a
mucking gang, he avoids prison.

06:49.654 --> 06:50.987
The first day of work he misses

06:50.989 --> 06:53.656
is the day he begins
his sentence at sing sing.

06:56.844 --> 06:59.328
Thank you, sir.

06:59.330 --> 07:00.847
Go on.

07:00.849 --> 07:03.299
Thank you.

07:11.008 --> 07:13.009
Lazarus returns!

07:13.011 --> 07:14.978
It seems, in two weeks,
nothing changes.

07:14.980 --> 07:18.481
Are you truly ready to
face the blood and guts?

07:18.483 --> 07:21.701
Some things, a man was born for,
like policing with this force.

07:21.703 --> 07:24.487
Well, we do need you.

07:24.489 --> 07:25.789
Hey, what the hell?

07:25.791 --> 07:27.373
Just following orders,
detective.

07:27.375 --> 07:28.742
Your friend is headed
to the tombs,

07:28.744 --> 07:31.327
under arrest
for attempted murder.

07:31.329 --> 07:32.695
Eva, what happened?

07:32.697 --> 07:38.551
A man beat Lola, so I
stabbed him in the eye.

07:38.553 --> 07:41.421
Please.

07:41.423 --> 07:42.589
I know your mother.

07:42.591 --> 07:45.008
Yes. The carriage, please.

07:45.010 --> 07:47.477
Hey, Glynn, talk to the warden.

07:47.479 --> 07:50.480
I want her in
the governor's cell.

07:50.482 --> 07:53.316
I don't need a damn cell.
You all act like no one

07:53.318 --> 07:54.901
has ever given a drunk
what he's asked for.

07:54.903 --> 07:56.986
Donovan will know a way
to get you released.

07:56.988 --> 07:59.072
I'll come to see you
after I talk to him.

07:59.074 --> 08:02.391
This way. Come on, get in.

08:16.791 --> 08:24.791
In the evenings, I'm reminded of
Thomas, how quietly he moved.

08:25.100 --> 08:30.436
As a child, when the day was done,
he liked to lay down in the grass

08:30.438 --> 08:34.890
and feel the heat of the
day leave the earth.

08:34.893 --> 08:38.977
We were always waiting
for the moon to rise.

08:38.980 --> 08:41.364
That was his way
of pretending us free.

08:42.933 --> 08:45.235
Oh, that boy.

08:45.237 --> 08:49.873
He started and ended
every day with hope.

08:49.875 --> 08:51.624
Mama, tomorrow, when
we go to the butcher,

08:51.626 --> 08:54.460
I want you to remind me I need...
Sara,

08:54.462 --> 08:57.630
tell me what Thomas
was like in this city.

08:57.632 --> 08:58.915
That was years ago, now.

08:58.917 --> 09:03.136
Just tell me what it was like,
the last morning he was alive.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.592
I don't know. I'm sure we moved
through our usual routine.

09:09.594 --> 09:15.798
You do remember, and the
memories are not yours to keep!

09:15.800 --> 09:18.234
You just want to hurry forward

09:18.236 --> 09:21.137
with this new life,
but sharing memories,

09:21.139 --> 09:26.192
that keeps Louis and
Thomas alive for us.

09:27.612 --> 09:29.979
Please, you must help us!

09:29.981 --> 09:31.781
Get out! It's our block!

09:31.783 --> 09:33.416
We got here first!

09:33.418 --> 09:37.003
The house is burnin'.

09:37.005 --> 09:38.171
A home is on fire!

09:38.173 --> 09:41.090
Only one company gets
paid for the work.

09:41.092 --> 09:42.675
They're just sorting out who.

09:42.677 --> 09:45.545
Why is everybody in this
city so violent?!

09:45.547 --> 09:46.963
Will you neighbors
ever see each other

09:46.965 --> 09:48.884
as human beings?!
You can't involve yourself

09:48.885 --> 09:50.533
in every single problem here mama.

09:50.658 --> 09:51.991
Come on, this way.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.325
This is our home! Please!

10:05.663 --> 10:08.056
Are you going to
stoke that fire?

10:10.168 --> 10:12.335
I was just thinking
about those flames

10:12.337 --> 10:15.422
taking everything
from them people.

10:15.424 --> 10:18.091
Tammany hall will get
them a new place.

10:18.093 --> 10:22.462
The Irish take
care of their own.

10:32.473 --> 10:35.308
You really rise
this early every day?

10:35.310 --> 10:37.343
In Five Points,
the only opportunity

10:37.345 --> 10:41.013
for uninterrupted research is dawn,
which leads me to the purpose...

10:41.015 --> 10:42.849
oh, I'd offer you
a taste, I know

10:42.851 --> 10:45.568
you'd give me that
withering look.

10:45.570 --> 10:47.320
I have traced a disease
sweeping through

10:47.322 --> 10:50.039
the Leonard street
tenement a dirty well.

10:50.041 --> 10:54.120
Curing the stricken has
been nearly impossible,

10:54.122 --> 10:56.789
but if the source were to be...
I'll check the records, but I doubt

10:56.791 --> 10:58.858
the Morehouse estate
owns a tenement.

10:58.860 --> 11:01.961
Well, my aim is greater
than this building alone.

11:01.963 --> 11:07.500
I have written a tract which
identifies all the water sources

11:07.502 --> 11:09.002
within Five Points
at risk of contamination,

11:09.004 --> 11:12.088
along with recommendations
for the future.

11:12.090 --> 11:15.041
I want the tract
published, but,

11:15.043 --> 11:17.810
no one will accept the
findings of a black man,

11:17.812 --> 11:21.213
which demonstrates that northern
freedom is no absolute.

11:21.215 --> 11:25.051
That, I can't help with,
but, if you were to publish

11:25.053 --> 11:27.236
under the pseudonym
of a white man...

11:27.238 --> 11:30.490
Certainly, The Provost
at my Alma Mater

11:30.492 --> 11:33.276
knows a doctor both
reputable and agreeable.

11:33.278 --> 11:33.778
Yes.

11:37.732 --> 11:39.248
Let's change lives.

11:40.751 --> 11:42.668
If Ramsey lives,

11:42.670 --> 11:44.504
we'll let the dust settle
and I can assure you'll walk.

11:44.506 --> 11:45.955
If he dies?

11:45.957 --> 11:49.842
A turn of events which would
complicate your situation.

11:49.844 --> 11:54.097
Liquored men die every day, by their
own hands, or plenty of others'.

11:54.099 --> 11:55.848
You're forgetting Ramsey
isn't your ordinary.

11:55.850 --> 11:57.767
Five Points ruffian.
He's of greenwich village,

11:57.769 --> 12:00.019
and those citizens love
vocalizing their importance.

12:00.021 --> 12:02.772
What am I supposed
to do now, here?

12:02.774 --> 12:06.592
We catholics have a thing
called a retreat...

12:06.594 --> 12:10.279
not like a retreat in battle,
but a renewal of the soul.

12:10.281 --> 12:13.316
Use your time here to reflect.

12:13.318 --> 12:14.951
Let us work on your half. Be

12:21.318 --> 12:23.446
I'm not used to being
at someone else's mercy.

12:23.448 --> 12:28.201
I'll have Freeman we'll
plan for either scenario.

12:28.203 --> 12:31.621
Even if he lives, I have
a feeling I'll hang.

12:31.623 --> 12:34.073
This city,
when minds are set...

12:34.075 --> 12:36.709
there's been no public
outcry, all right?

12:36.711 --> 12:40.213
Hanging me also hangs
my child, Corky.

12:40.215 --> 12:45.301
Look, you and your
child, you're safe.

12:45.303 --> 12:47.053
I promise to get you
out of here.

12:54.645 --> 12:57.796
After speaking to Freeman,
stop by the paradise.

12:57.798 --> 13:00.817
I want Lola in charge...
every penny, every prick.

13:00.819 --> 13:03.186
And tell her to keep
an eye on Richie.

13:03.188 --> 13:04.987
I think he's started
stealing from the till.

13:19.953 --> 13:24.757
In this marriage, the two
really have become one.

13:24.759 --> 13:26.509
Can you outpace him yet?

13:26.511 --> 13:28.711
Please remember you
wouldn't be in this room

13:28.713 --> 13:31.631
if it weren't for me, norbert.

13:31.633 --> 13:35.434
Do tell, what
fresh hell is this?

13:35.436 --> 13:38.304
A personal project, none of
your business responsibility.

13:38.306 --> 13:41.474
"The abominable quality
of downtown water...

13:41.476 --> 13:44.843
Runoff and waste causing
grievous conditions..."

13:44.845 --> 13:46.946
This doesn't concern you!

13:46.948 --> 13:49.014
"We demand that
the responsibility"

13:49.016 --> 13:53.369
for portable water fall to each
well's neighboring corporations,

13:53.371 --> 13:55.988
with failure to comply
resulting in fines

13:55.990 --> 13:59.575
"and, if necessary,
forced closures."

14:01.745 --> 14:06.632
I assume you are among
the "we" in question.

14:06.634 --> 14:12.138
Are you aware another "we", you
and I, own half the corporations

14:12.140 --> 14:13.890
below 14th street?

14:13.892 --> 14:21.264
Today's business lesson... one
does not Levy fines upon oneself.

14:26.219 --> 14:29.238
Business, and all its related
lessons, are done for the day.

14:29.240 --> 14:32.358
I am sure you have
somewhere else to be.

14:44.121 --> 14:49.375
The fool thinks
I can be outpaced.

14:49.377 --> 14:51.177
I embrace the challenge.

14:58.852 --> 15:00.252
Detective, a drink?

15:00.254 --> 15:01.637
Oh, here on business.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.088
I'll take a short one.

15:03.090 --> 15:05.024
Christ, Lola, you look
like you were bobbin'

15:05.026 --> 15:06.442
when you should've
been weavin'.

15:06.444 --> 15:09.428
I wish I'd shot that animal
before Eva had to stab him.

15:09.430 --> 15:12.398
Was Ramsey going after her
before she stabbed him?

15:12.400 --> 15:14.233
He got what was due,
if that's what you mean.

15:14.235 --> 15:17.486
Well, emotions aside, I'm trying
to make a case for self-defense.

15:17.488 --> 15:19.822
What do you think I'm
going to say, detective?

15:19.824 --> 15:21.273
Eva Heissen is more
than just my boss.

15:21.275 --> 15:23.242
You too, Richie? Eva
didn't have a choice.

15:23.244 --> 15:25.661
Let's not forget...
the knife was Ramsey's.

15:25.663 --> 15:28.798
How many other witnesses will back
you up, that don't work for Eva?

15:28.800 --> 15:31.300
I'd say a dozen or more. Any
other than the regulars?

15:31.302 --> 15:32.718
Out-of-towners, maybe?

15:32.720 --> 15:34.086
Any ing to back Ramsey?

15:34.088 --> 15:37.790
His cousin, um, Jenkins something...
Paul... was here.

15:37.792 --> 15:41.560
Let me guess... he hightailed
when the trouble started.

15:41.562 --> 15:44.563
He's a souse, squanders his
family's money all over downtown.

15:44.565 --> 15:47.016
Could I have a word with Lola?

15:49.135 --> 15:55.140
Eva says she wants you in charge,
and keep an eye on your barkeep.

15:55.142 --> 15:58.194
Sure, I'll keep the place
spinning like a child's top.

15:58.196 --> 16:02.531
Any problems, you need any
help of any kind, just yell.

16:02.533 --> 16:05.368
I can think of a thing or two.

16:05.370 --> 16:06.819
Think of something else.

16:09.423 --> 16:15.678
Old pepper has always been my favorite,
for Halpenny bourbon whiskey.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.848
If I may suggest, given the
quantity of consumption,

16:18.850 --> 16:20.933
A.M. Bininger & company
sells in bulk.

16:20.935 --> 16:22.351
Actually, why should we
be forced to choose?

16:22.353 --> 16:23.719
Order them all.

16:23.721 --> 16:25.971
A full case of each?
Are you expecting a siege?

16:25.973 --> 16:28.941
Oh, loosen up, James.

16:28.943 --> 16:30.860
Here you go.

16:30.862 --> 16:33.612
Why don't you taste, see
which one you prefer?

16:33.614 --> 16:37.256
I appreciate the offer, ma'am, but
I do not imbibe while at work.

16:37.258 --> 16:41.510
How charming.

16:48.268 --> 16:51.170
Ramsey lost an enormous amount of
blood and will certainly lose sight

16:51.172 --> 16:52.972
in the injured eye,
however, the wound

16:52.974 --> 16:54.440
did not penetrate deeply
into the brain.

16:54.442 --> 16:57.610
- Will he live?
- Yes.

16:57.612 --> 17:00.730
There's always risk of side
effects, secondary trauma.

17:00.732 --> 17:02.148
Hey, breathing's
good enough for me.

17:02.150 --> 17:04.534
Now, to tell Eva the good
news. Thank you.

17:04.536 --> 17:10.038
Excuse me, is there... sorry,
I'm on police business.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.789
Ah.

17:11.790 --> 17:14.409
Go on, be on your way, anyway.

17:17.829 --> 17:22.000
What brings such a pretty
face down to this dump?

17:22.002 --> 17:24.586
I'm looking for
a Detective Corcoran.

17:24.588 --> 17:27.088
Why's that?

17:27.089 --> 17:32.548
He sent my parents a telegram
regarding a murder that I witnessed.

17:32.550 --> 17:34.684
And what do you call
yourself, then?

17:34.686 --> 17:37.687
My name's Teresa trembley.

17:37.689 --> 17:39.655
Tare an'ouns.

17:43.217 --> 17:46.019
I watched Alderman
Bartlett die.

17:46.021 --> 17:52.192
The man who killed him had already
gagged me and then he was...

17:52.194 --> 17:57.581
If you saw the murderer again,
could you identify him?

17:57.583 --> 17:59.366
Yes.

17:59.368 --> 18:01.452
I will never forget
that man's face.

18:03.455 --> 18:06.206
As the Alderman died,
he looked me in the eye

18:06.208 --> 18:08.592
and he told me I was next.

18:08.594 --> 18:13.097
And, my dear, how did
you avoid being such?

18:15.350 --> 18:18.585
I gave the wall a kicking.

18:18.587 --> 18:24.024
My neighbor Mab O'Dwyer,
she hates any racket.

18:24.026 --> 18:30.114
She threatened to come over
and silence the noise.

18:30.116 --> 18:35.435
As the man approached
me, Mab's door opened.

18:35.437 --> 18:38.271
The murderer must've panicked.

18:38.273 --> 18:40.624
He ran.

18:40.626 --> 18:45.379
Right away, I locked the door, I
packed a few things, and I fled.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.590
I'll let Kevin know
the case has been reopened.

18:53.592 --> 18:56.677
Detective corcoran has enough
trouble to sort, at the moment.

18:56.679 --> 19:00.230
I trust you can handle
this lead on your own.

19:00.232 --> 19:02.516
Arrange for Teresa's
hiding, now.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.238
Mar.

19:08.240 --> 19:11.307
First, I would like to emphasize
that I am proceeding with the plan.

19:11.309 --> 19:15.451
Though, second, my father has
destroyed your document.

19:18.872 --> 19:21.757
Why was your father
in possession of my work?

19:21.759 --> 19:23.676
I'm meeting with Dr. Wells,

19:23.678 --> 19:26.879
chief medical officer at Columbia
college, this afternoon.

19:26.881 --> 19:29.632
But you have nothing
to show him.

19:29.634 --> 19:31.333
Then draft a new paper.

19:31.335 --> 19:33.519
I'll convince Wells
of our objective.

19:33.521 --> 19:34.687
He is ambitious.

19:34.689 --> 19:39.609
And, when he agrees, I will hand
the new papers directly to him

19:39.611 --> 19:41.510
and your words
will reach the public.

19:41.512 --> 19:45.448
But if this Dr. Wells is as reputable
as you claim, he won't trust

19:45.450 --> 19:47.733
a verbal report,
from a businessman.

19:47.735 --> 19:49.952
Then get writing.

19:49.954 --> 19:52.738
We're going to make
a mark on history.

19:52.740 --> 19:55.541
And, this time,
script two copies.

20:02.299 --> 20:04.250
Donovan doesn't make
false promises.

20:07.221 --> 20:11.424
Tenements all looking the
same gives me the creeps.

20:11.426 --> 20:13.476
I feel like I'm back
in my old room.

20:13.478 --> 20:17.063
Ah, this is no room.

20:17.065 --> 20:18.431
This is a palace.

20:18.433 --> 20:22.018
Because you, Teresa,
are a queen.

20:23.271 --> 20:24.987
Your throne.

20:28.609 --> 20:30.910
Donovan began
like us, you know.

20:30.912 --> 20:33.896
He immigrated and found
his place in the city,

20:33.898 --> 20:35.865
climbed his way to the top.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.451
Well, if not the top,
the near-top.

20:38.453 --> 20:41.871
I don't know that I could climb anywhere.

20:41.873 --> 20:43.256
I'm not even sure
I knew what I wanted,

20:43.258 --> 20:44.740
coming to New York
from Hamilton.

20:44.742 --> 20:47.376
Well, that's what makes
this city special...

20:47.378 --> 20:50.079
you don't need to know upfront.

20:50.081 --> 20:53.248
I was promised a lot of
things by Alderman Bartlett.

20:53.250 --> 20:59.710
In the end, all he left me with was
fear and that image of his death.

21:01.558 --> 21:05.561
I don't think there's much
of a future for me here.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.268
Right.

21:13.270 --> 21:16.706
But look at Donovan...
he'll *** the coppers

21:16.708 --> 21:19.458
because his contracting business
was so successful.

21:19.460 --> 21:23.160
Then Tammany noticed, and all these
things, one after the other.

21:23.162 --> 21:25.245
But he started
with a dirt floor,

21:25.247 --> 21:27.781
knowing only he wanted
more than dirt.

21:27.783 --> 21:35.121
Here's the truth... greatness
starts with everyday, boring stuff.

21:35.123 --> 21:38.058
It's how you approach
it that matters.

21:38.060 --> 21:40.928
Well, maybe I've finally
met the right people.

21:49.487 --> 21:53.139
Ah, I see you have some pepper
back in your step, detective.

21:53.141 --> 21:55.943
I stopped by the paradise and
talked to some witnesses.

21:55.945 --> 21:57.945
Eva's got a pretty strong
claim of self-defense.

21:57.947 --> 22:00.197
Ramsey pulled the knife.

22:00.199 --> 22:02.115
He was a train wreck,
smacked one of Eva's girls.

22:02.117 --> 22:05.168
Ah, yes, the dusky young Lola.

22:05.170 --> 22:06.987
At least we got cause
to free her on bail.

22:06.989 --> 22:08.714
I thought I had made myself
perfectly clear

22:08.716 --> 22:11.666
of *** Detective, but
obviously, not clear enough.

22:11.668 --> 22:15.837
I get this Ramsey isn't some anonymous
guttersnipe, but we need...

22:15.839 --> 22:19.725
it's a mayoral election year, corcoran,
in case you haven't noticed.

22:19.727 --> 22:23.312
So, every two years, rich
assholes get a pass?

22:23.314 --> 22:26.481
I think, by now, you know
me better than that, Kevin.

22:26.483 --> 22:29.484
Eva's a businesswoman.

22:29.486 --> 22:30.902
She kicks a lot of money
up the chain.

22:30.904 --> 22:34.323
She's a friend, and more.

22:34.325 --> 22:40.662
I understand that,
Kevin, I really do,

22:40.664 --> 22:43.999
but, please,
show some patience.

22:44.001 --> 22:47.803
We rescue her together.

22:50.640 --> 22:52.707
My doctor friend says
Ramsey's sure to live.

22:52.709 --> 22:56.561
Well, there you have it... a
glimmer of perpetual light.

23:46.279 --> 23:51.733
You are going to be bossing
those girls around in no time.

23:51.735 --> 23:54.769
How certain was Freeman?

23:54.771 --> 23:57.873
Matthew always plays careful,
especially with diagnosis.

23:57.875 --> 24:01.793
Ramsey, the blind
bastard, will survive.

24:05.415 --> 24:07.332
And so we live on.

24:09.168 --> 24:10.635
Corcoran, out.

24:10.637 --> 24:12.787
I need a word with
Miss Heissen, alone.

24:12.789 --> 24:15.640
If it's anything to do with her
case, I'm not going anywhere.

24:15.642 --> 24:17.175
You've already stuck
your nose in enough.

24:17.177 --> 24:19.478
Captain, I prefer Kevin stay.

24:19.480 --> 24:22.147
Jack Ramsey died.

24:22.149 --> 24:23.765
Found in his bed
at Saint Vincent's.

24:23.767 --> 24:27.809
I'm sorry, Eva, you'll be
prosecuted for murder.

24:27.811 --> 24:29.644
No, he can't be dead.

24:29.646 --> 24:33.365
So go to the hospital
and talk him out of it.

24:33.367 --> 24:35.650
They'll be calling
a grand jury post haste.

24:45.879 --> 24:53.093
But you said... in the army,
we always have a second plan.

24:53.095 --> 24:54.545
We'll start organizing
your dense.

24:54.547 --> 24:57.297
I'm just another Five Points immigrant
in the tombs... disposable.

24:57.299 --> 25:01.301
No. Your friends will fight for ya.
I'll fight for ya.

25:01.303 --> 25:03.136
I consider myself a survivor,

25:03.138 --> 25:06.640
someone who acts, but, within these
walls, there's no action to take.

25:06.642 --> 25:08.275
Ramsey was the instigator.

25:08.277 --> 25:10.510
We'll bury the grand
jury with witnesses.

25:10.512 --> 25:11.979
Kevin, I've been around
New York long enough

25:11.981 --> 25:15.115
to know the truth
rarely wins the day.

25:15.117 --> 25:18.619
Fixing this is my job, Eva.

25:28.046 --> 25:30.747
I...Can't.

25:30.749 --> 25:33.083
That's okay.

25:33.085 --> 25:34.668
It's okay.

25:34.670 --> 25:39.306
It's okay, just...
just be here.

25:39.308 --> 25:42.476
Just allow me. Oh, yeah.

25:42.478 --> 25:45.479
Oh. Oh.

25:46.936 --> 25:49.687
The are deeds to properties in
the aqueduct's right-of-way.

25:49.689 --> 25:51.055
Organize my presentation.

25:51.057 --> 25:52.523
I'm off to officially
register my bid

25:52.525 --> 25:55.026
in advance of tomorrow's
council vote.

25:55.028 --> 25:56.444
Everything will be
waiting on your desk

25:56.446 --> 25:57.812
when you get back
from the meeting.

25:57.814 --> 25:59.197
And good luck, sir.

25:59.199 --> 26:03.100
Luck? I hope we've obviated the
need for the whims of fortune.

26:03.102 --> 26:05.936
Not the desk, the lockbox.

26:05.938 --> 26:09.123
These documents will determine our
future, in more ways than one.

26:28.877 --> 26:32.830
"To Governor Reuben Fenton".

26:34.718 --> 26:41.672
I like that name, Reuben.

26:41.674 --> 26:49.263
"Is it true you frolicked
"with Mary Todd?" Full stop.

26:49.265 --> 26:50.932
"No?"

26:50.934 --> 26:54.602
Exclamation, exclamation.

26:54.604 --> 26:57.605
Ahem! Excuse me.

26:59.992 --> 27:02.026
You're not Governor Reuben.

27:07.649 --> 27:10.535
Or the odd Mary Todd.

27:12.337 --> 27:15.423
Are you a new friend?

27:15.425 --> 27:17.875
I've decided to
collect them again.

27:17.877 --> 27:20.011
This must be
the wrong residence.

27:20.013 --> 27:24.515
The Butler should not
have allowed me through.

27:24.517 --> 27:27.185
Ah. Ahem!

27:27.187 --> 27:30.605
Elizabeth. Dr. Wells.

27:30.607 --> 27:33.057
This inebriate is your wife?

27:33.059 --> 27:36.360
She... doctor, come
with me to my parlor.

27:36.362 --> 27:40.681
I wasn't aware... from this lack
of decorum, sir, I trust nothing,

27:40.683 --> 27:44.068
much less a medical tract.

27:44.070 --> 27:48.873
I have never encountered
such brazen indecency.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.291
Sir!

27:55.831 --> 27:57.548
That doctor was my only
remaining channel

27:57.550 --> 28:00.718
for publishing Freeman's study.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.837
What in God's name
are you doing?

28:02.839 --> 28:05.673
I want to dance, Robert.

28:05.675 --> 28:07.425
I want to dance.

28:07.427 --> 28:10.044
You keep up the act,
the invitations

28:10.046 --> 28:12.730
will surely dry up.
Now, please.

28:12.732 --> 28:16.901
Not some boring uptown
stodgy soirée.

28:16.903 --> 28:19.854
Something dark,
something downtown.

28:24.159 --> 28:29.413
You can't even begin to fathom
the darkness of downtown.

28:38.041 --> 28:39.757
Take me, Robert.

28:46.715 --> 28:48.633
Hold me.

28:55.858 --> 28:57.692
Ahh.

29:04.900 --> 29:06.234
Ahh!

29:08.770 --> 29:10.705
No wait, I need some stuff.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.156
I want to make a stew.

29:12.158 --> 29:14.942
Let's see if
everything is fresh.

29:14.944 --> 29:17.628
Buy what you touch, or move on.

29:17.630 --> 29:19.650
We're just finding the best.

29:19.652 --> 29:21.902
My mama's a fine cook.

29:21.904 --> 29:23.771
Let me see.

29:23.773 --> 29:26.741
I said, get your soiled
hands out of my goods!

29:26.743 --> 29:28.576
There's disease everywhere!

29:28.578 --> 29:30.027
That man is a doctor.

29:30.029 --> 29:32.496
He will tell you
what is a disease.

29:32.498 --> 29:36.316
What kind of a world do you
think this is, mammy,

29:36.318 --> 29:37.985
Where a nigger
can tell me what's what?

29:37.987 --> 29:40.821
I don't know what kind of
world this is, mister.

29:40.823 --> 29:42.489
Let's move on, mama.

29:42.491 --> 29:45.259
This was a damn nice city,
'til you people showed up.

29:45.261 --> 29:46.677
Cost both my brothers
their jobs.

29:46.679 --> 29:48.462
You're worse than the Irish!

29:48.464 --> 29:49.764
Their jobs?

29:49.766 --> 29:51.498
Maybe they should've
worked harder.

29:51.500 --> 29:52.883
Mama, come on.
Okay, that's enough.

29:56.471 --> 29:58.973
Matthew, no!

29:58.975 --> 30:02.676
You speak to my family again
and I will put your thick head

30:02.678 --> 30:04.178
through that window.

30:04.180 --> 30:06.313
Matthew!

30:06.315 --> 30:08.983
Let him go.

30:08.985 --> 30:10.534
Please.

30:17.325 --> 30:18.742
Mama, come on!

30:18.744 --> 30:20.494
You have no idea,
the people I know.

30:20.496 --> 30:22.630
Come on, now.

30:24.549 --> 30:26.000
Matthew!

30:27.719 --> 30:28.886
Come on!

30:28.888 --> 30:31.019
I'll speak to your filthy
women whenever I want!

30:31.032 --> 30:33.174
And, if I want...

30:33.176 --> 30:36.043
Matthew! I'll burn them!

30:36.045 --> 30:39.346
I'll burn them all!

30:44.686 --> 30:46.987
As for the business
of the proposed aqueduct,

30:46.989 --> 30:48.906
all final bids
must be delivered here

30:48.908 --> 30:51.242
city hall,
by midnight tomorrow.

30:51.244 --> 30:56.393
At the public works meeting next
week, construction on this project

30:56.395 --> 30:58.912
is scheduled to commence
the 1st of may.

30:58.914 --> 31:01.748
We now close this meeting
with a moment of silence

31:01.750 --> 31:04.000
for the late Alderman,
Stephen bartlett.

31:04.002 --> 31:08.789
Thank you for
supporting my proposal.

31:08.791 --> 31:10.540
Has there been
any sign of Lansing?

31:10.542 --> 31:13.576
Like a sparrow
in winter... gone.

31:13.578 --> 31:17.914
Perhaps he finally realized he's
no competition for me, after all.

31:17.916 --> 31:19.265
I bet not.

31:19.267 --> 31:20.917
Why?

31:20.919 --> 31:25.388
He sent an associate to register
his bid for tomorrow's vote.

31:29.110 --> 31:33.396
Ah, well, then, may
the best man win.

31:33.398 --> 31:35.615
I took a risk, backing
your plan, Donovan.

31:35.617 --> 31:40.624
I hope that decision does not
come to cause me embarrassment.

31:43.661 --> 31:48.078
May our departed colleague rest in
peace, this meeting is concluded.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.913
Freeman visited Jack Ramsey

31:49.915 --> 31:52.799
just before his death,
said he would live.

31:52.801 --> 31:56.503
They don't get a say I guess death
comes knockin', no use trying

31:56.505 --> 31:57.888
to step out the back door.

31:57.890 --> 32:00.625
Doesn't seem like death was
knockin' for Ramsey, though.

32:00.627 --> 32:04.928
Life's been giving us shite hands,
Corky, but Eva's a tough gal.

32:04.930 --> 32:07.063
She'll come out all right.

32:07.065 --> 32:08.631
Thanks, Buck.

32:08.633 --> 32:10.567
Remember when
The Paradise opened?

32:10.569 --> 32:12.235
Yeah right before the war.

32:12.237 --> 32:14.187
Seems like we were
kids, back then.

32:14.189 --> 32:16.740
Yeah. We were.

32:16.742 --> 32:21.661
She's always been there for us...
a drink, a room, an ear.

32:21.663 --> 32:24.748
No way I'll let Eva hang.

32:24.750 --> 32:27.951
Kevin, just promise me
you'll do this smart.

32:27.953 --> 32:29.652
Do what?

32:29.654 --> 32:32.622
Whatever the hell
you're planning to do.

32:32.624 --> 32:36.342
Well, I've learned from
General Donovan, haven't I?

32:36.344 --> 32:37.761
Come on, I want
to check on Eva's.

32:37.763 --> 32:39.129
Me and Glynn
already stopped in.

32:39.131 --> 32:40.663
No sign of Jenkins.

32:40.665 --> 32:42.882
I want to make sure
Lola's faring okay.

32:42.884 --> 32:44.100
All right.

32:44.102 --> 32:47.604
I got to drop this meat off at
home, then I'll catch up with ya.

32:47.606 --> 32:51.174
Great.

32:51.176 --> 32:55.678
What were you like as a girl?

32:55.680 --> 33:01.785
Like anyone, I suppose,
dreaming of a husband,

33:01.787 --> 33:05.705
praying I'd turn out pretty.

33:05.707 --> 33:09.525
Elizabeth, I don't believe
that for a moment.

33:09.527 --> 33:15.048
Please, I'd like to know how
the woman I love came to be.

33:15.050 --> 33:18.051
My youth wasn't easy.

33:18.053 --> 33:21.704
Meaning?

33:21.706 --> 33:23.056
Was your father cruel?

33:23.058 --> 33:25.141
Oh, no, nothing like that.

33:25.143 --> 33:28.178
He was a good man.

33:28.180 --> 33:31.648
Just with five daughters, when
he had more use for a son.

33:39.723 --> 33:45.028
Why are you suddenly so
interested in my youth?

33:45.030 --> 33:50.083
I feel we are formed into
stone early in life.

33:50.085 --> 33:56.039
I think, moving forward,
we should indulge less.

33:56.041 --> 33:58.341
Robert, don't be silly.

33:58.343 --> 34:02.545
It's all fun, but, today, you
cost a friend of mine...

34:02.547 --> 34:06.749
of ours... something
very dear to him.

34:06.751 --> 34:10.887
A little incident, a joke,
Robert, that went awry.

34:10.889 --> 34:13.523
I meant no harm, truly.

34:13.525 --> 34:16.609
I know I introduced you to the
opium, so I deserve blame.

34:16.610 --> 34:19.728
I like the way
it makes me feel,

34:19.731 --> 34:23.032
the peace it brings
my turbulent mind.

34:31.208 --> 34:35.128
Let's just take a vacation
from the stuff, shall we?

34:35.130 --> 34:36.913
Wait.

34:36.915 --> 34:40.300
At least, let me have
the last little drop.

34:40.302 --> 34:40.802
Fine.

34:45.257 --> 34:52.094
But, after this night, we pursue
different recreations for a while.

35:01.638 --> 35:03.072
After the vote is held,
we need to get

35:03.074 --> 35:04.524
hiring lists drawn up.
Let's fill as many

35:04.526 --> 35:05.975
of the spots as we can
with sixth-warders.

35:05.977 --> 35:09.195
After that, Tammany will give
us lists for the other wards.

35:21.675 --> 35:26.296
Well, Orrin Lansing, you
want the gloves to come off?

35:26.298 --> 35:28.097
Then so be it.

35:28.099 --> 35:29.883
Summon detective Maguire
immediately.

35:29.885 --> 35:31.801
Contact Mr. O'Malley
at the funeral home.

35:31.803 --> 35:35.471
I'll draft a letter to
Mr. O'Hearn's parents.

35:57.734 --> 36:01.687
You came back to have fun,
or are you still working?

36:01.689 --> 36:04.723
I came for a long-
overdue drink.

36:04.725 --> 36:06.025
Hey.

36:06.027 --> 36:08.744
I went to Donohue's on Mulberry
to borrow some bitters and that

36:08.746 --> 36:10.529
jackass Jenkins
was drinkin' there.

36:17.370 --> 36:20.239
You and I both know this
city demands a certain level

36:20.241 --> 36:23.125
of humility and patience.

36:23.127 --> 36:25.961
Do you remember our adjustment?

36:25.963 --> 36:30.082
New rules, unfamiliar
norms, with a multitude

36:30.084 --> 36:34.019
of sounds and smells distracting
us from any real understanding.

36:34.021 --> 36:35.938
These past few weeks,
Hattie has become

36:35.940 --> 36:38.440
more unhappy and
less accommodating.

36:38.442 --> 36:39.808
She is not progressing.

36:39.810 --> 36:43.862
Mama's older and stubborn.

36:43.864 --> 36:45.397
The way she conducts herself

36:45.399 --> 36:48.701
in this community,
it reflects back on us.

36:48.703 --> 36:53.155
The man who attacked that shopkeeper
is not the man I want to be.

36:53.157 --> 36:57.376
Remember that she only just
learned her sons died.

36:57.378 --> 37:02.131
And what happens when she learns
the truth of those deaths?

37:02.133 --> 37:05.718
Will we have to endure this
adjustment all over again?

37:28.808 --> 37:29.992
Hey.

37:31.528 --> 37:33.612
I take it the guy in the
fancy suit is Jenkins.

37:33.614 --> 37:37.032
Might be. He's the only one
here I don't know by name.

37:37.034 --> 37:39.201
I'll take a bottle.

37:45.825 --> 37:47.379
You're from Greenwich Village.

37:47.381 --> 37:49.665
Jenkins, right?

37:49.667 --> 37:54.103
Who wants to know?

37:54.105 --> 37:57.523
Nobody in this city is ever
just trying to be friendly.

37:57.525 --> 38:00.226
Well...

38:02.813 --> 38:04.864
Ooh! I am unimpressed.

38:04.866 --> 38:09.785
I want to make sure we get
justice for your cousin.

38:09.787 --> 38:12.521
Well I heard that whore
got locked up

38:12.523 --> 38:14.289
and is going to hang
for killing Jack.

38:14.291 --> 38:18.527
She will, indeed, only, did
your cousin have anything do

38:18.529 --> 38:19.878
with what happened?

38:19.880 --> 38:22.548
Did he provoke the stabbing?

38:22.550 --> 38:23.999
Who cares about a whore?

38:24.001 --> 38:27.469
Nobody.

38:27.471 --> 38:31.557
I need to make sure our prosecutor
has a solid case to argue.

38:31.559 --> 38:35.094
I remember when that little
sausage-eater was new in town.

38:35.096 --> 38:38.647
Me and six of my friends, we took
her one night on my cousin's boat,

38:38.649 --> 38:41.578
passed her around like
a bottle of cheap booze.

38:43.365 --> 38:48.535
You know, she is as
nasty a little whore

38:48.537 --> 38:50.504
as ever walked
this city's streets,

38:50.506 --> 38:54.291
and I'm going to piss on her grave
for what she did to my cousin.

39:04.218 --> 39:05.135
Aah!

39:13.194 --> 39:15.762
Jesus, Kevin!

39:15.764 --> 39:17.447
You're gonna kill him!

39:17.449 --> 39:18.598
That's enough!

39:18.600 --> 39:23.403
This is how you do things smart, huh?

39:23.405 --> 39:25.238
Let's go. Go!

39:37.418 --> 39:40.587
I don't need a noose.

39:40.589 --> 39:44.558
This cell will kill me, first.

39:44.560 --> 39:47.727
How am I supposed to organize
a defense from in here?

39:47.729 --> 39:50.097
The truth of the justice
system is, the prisoner

39:50.099 --> 39:54.151
has no agency, but you, my dear,
have friends, such as myself.

39:55.654 --> 39:59.022
I keep hearing that.

39:59.024 --> 40:00.824
I want to see it,
to believe it.

40:00.826 --> 40:02.492
And, yet, you must.

40:02.494 --> 40:05.529
I'll investigate
your options tomorrow.

40:07.481 --> 40:11.751
I hope you realize how tricky
this whole scenario is.

40:11.753 --> 40:15.422
It's trickier than
even you think.

40:15.424 --> 40:18.842
Huh. How so?

40:23.632 --> 40:25.665
The baby I carry is yours.

40:25.667 --> 40:27.684
Ah.

40:27.686 --> 40:29.769
Lucky you.

40:29.771 --> 40:33.273
You'll have a fine specimen to
continue your legacy of wile

40:33.275 --> 40:37.110
and my stature is
something of a badge.

40:37.112 --> 40:39.179
What about the public?

40:39.181 --> 40:43.283
The Tammany ward boss...
careful, now.

40:43.285 --> 40:46.686
I have a lot of enemies.

40:46.688 --> 40:50.240
If they hear
you carry my child,

40:50.242 --> 40:54.127
they might be inspired
to target you.

40:58.216 --> 41:02.886
Thank you for coming and for
your discretion in this matter.

41:02.888 --> 41:04.971
As discussed,
you're here to assess

41:04.973 --> 41:06.806
the new addition
to the solarium.

41:06.808 --> 41:09.226
Is that all I get to assess?

41:09.228 --> 41:12.345
I'm not here for
your entertainment.

41:12.347 --> 41:19.569
Well, maybe not, but, uh, you rich
ladies certainly can be amusing.

41:19.571 --> 41:20.604
Ah!

41:20.606 --> 41:21.988
Let me have it.

41:21.990 --> 41:23.890
This comes straight from
The Chinaman on Mott.

41:23.892 --> 41:25.775
You'll find this
a little more exciting

41:25.777 --> 41:28.561
than your husband's
strain, I think.

41:28.563 --> 41:34.400
When in need of more, you
now know how to reach me.

41:34.402 --> 41:36.269
Show yourself out.

42:13.140 --> 42:17.059
Mr. Maguire, did you
get my files back?

42:17.061 --> 42:19.395
I did.

42:19.397 --> 42:24.099
And did Mr. Lansing apologize for
what he done to young Milo O'Hearn?

42:24.101 --> 42:26.736
Profusely.

42:26.738 --> 42:31.457
And, lastly, Mr. Maguire, did
you explain to Mr. Lansing

42:31.459 --> 42:33.576
that his regrets came too late?

42:33.578 --> 42:35.411
I did.

42:35.413 --> 42:37.630
With pleasure.

42:37.632 --> 42:39.281
Proceed.

42:39.283 --> 42:42.786
- No!
- With pleasure.

42:42.788 --> 42:47.757
Hush Mr. Lansing, it'll
be over soon... Aah!

42:52.465 --> 42:55.600
No! No!
