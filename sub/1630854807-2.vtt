WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:04.308
.

00:04.352 --> 00:06.789
- Ukraine pleaded for more
military aid and vehicles,

00:06.832 --> 00:08.051
saying, "We are desperate,"

00:08.095 --> 00:09.487
but when
Katherine Hastings offered

00:09.531 --> 00:11.620
to ship them
a thousand Payne Hydras,

00:11.663 --> 00:13.796
Zelenskyy replied,
"Not that desperate."

00:13.839 --> 00:15.450
- [laughs]

00:15.493 --> 00:16.755
I'm not laughing at the joke.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.453
It's just Zelenskyy's
a funny-sounding name.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.063
- I didn't even do that.
- Yeah, it's like

00:20.107 --> 00:21.412
they just say stuff
to be funny.

00:21.456 --> 00:22.631
- Can you guys
set this straight?

00:22.674 --> 00:24.024
- You want me to release
a statement saying

00:24.067 --> 00:25.373
we aren't trying
to aid Ukraine?

00:25.416 --> 00:27.853
- The fire is out,
no one got hurt by the pawls,

00:27.897 --> 00:30.378
but Preppy McChipmunk won't
get his hand out of my skirt.

00:30.421 --> 00:31.770
- It's not just Seth.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.207
It's Fallon, it's Kimmel,
"The View," "The Talk."

00:33.250 --> 00:34.338
- John Oliver did a full

00:34.382 --> 00:36.166
20-minute segment on you
on Sunday.

00:36.210 --> 00:37.733
- Let me guess,
it was smug and reductive.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.213
- It was, actually.

00:39.256 --> 00:41.128
- You know what, I should
have just taken the payout.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.346
I could be on a beach right now

00:42.390 --> 00:43.521
with my husband, but no.

00:43.565 --> 00:44.696
Instead, we're fighting
all the time,

00:44.740 --> 00:46.089
and everyone hates me,
and all because

00:46.133 --> 00:47.525
I had to risk everything just

00:47.569 --> 00:48.613
to save your jobs.
- "Save your jobs"

00:48.657 --> 00:50.267
- We remember.
- So selfless.

00:50.311 --> 00:51.181
- Katherine,
this just came for you.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.400
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

00:52.443 --> 00:54.271
- It looks like
someone doesn't hate you.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.491
- Uh, we--we scan
for mail bombs, right?

00:56.534 --> 00:58.232
- Mm-hmm.
They got two dogs now.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.799
- You want Sadie and me to work
on some image rehab ideas or...

01:00.843 --> 01:02.497
- Uh, yeah, I guess so.

01:02.540 --> 01:05.282
I mean, look, I'm not some,
like, insecure little girl

01:05.325 --> 01:06.762
who needs everybody to like me.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.198
It's just, I can't
be an effective leader

01:08.242 --> 01:09.634
if I'm a national joke.

01:09.678 --> 01:11.419
Ew, what is this
packing material?

01:13.160 --> 01:14.551
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:14.596 --> 01:15.727
That's a pube! That's a pube!

01:15.771 --> 01:17.338
[all yelling]
That's a box of pubes!

01:17.381 --> 01:18.600
That's a box of pubes!

01:18.643 --> 01:20.428
- The AC's sucking 'em up.
They're airborne.

01:20.471 --> 01:22.212
[overlapping yelling]

01:22.256 --> 01:23.561
[upbeat music]

01:23.605 --> 01:25.476
- ♪ Bom bom
bom-bom-bom-bom-bom ♪

01:25.520 --> 01:27.478
♪ Buh buh bom-bom-bom
buh bom-bom-bom-bom ♪

01:27.521 --> 01:30.307
[chorus vocalizing]

01:30.351 --> 01:32.918
- Whatever happened
to just sending anthrax

01:32.962 --> 01:34.094
when you hated someone?

01:34.137 --> 01:35.356
When did that go out of style?

01:35.399 --> 01:36.878
- Isn't a box full
of pubes better

01:36.922 --> 01:37.923
than a box full of anthrax?

01:37.967 --> 01:39.316
- I honestly don't know.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.448
- They're sweeping up
all the evidence.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.145
We should be
sending these pubes

01:42.189 --> 01:43.146
to the lab
and catching this guy.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.146
- Or girl.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.322
- Jack, come on.

01:45.366 --> 01:46.584
Girls don't even
have pubes anymore,

01:46.628 --> 01:49.805
and if they did,
not these kind of pubes.

01:49.848 --> 01:51.589
- Just from looking at it,

01:51.633 --> 01:53.852
seemed like it came
from multiple people.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.941
- They say
those little hairs really got

01:55.985 --> 01:57.116
hooked into your carpet fiber,

01:57.160 --> 01:58.640
so they gotta dig 'em out.

01:58.683 --> 02:01.208
- Listen, Ian says that I have
to use social media more

02:01.251 --> 02:02.600
so people see my human side.

02:02.644 --> 02:03.775
What--what do you think
of this tweet?

02:03.819 --> 02:05.690
- "Today's a great day
to buy a car

02:05.734 --> 02:07.257
from your local
Payne Motor dealership."

02:07.301 --> 02:08.954
both: "Hashtag car."

02:08.997 --> 02:10.173
- You don't spell the hashtag.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.219
- God, I hate this stuff.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.221
I spent an hour trying
to write a funny tweet

02:14.264 --> 02:16.136
about why the Flintstones
carried their cars

02:16.179 --> 02:17.224
when they were just running.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.703
But when you break down
that show,

02:18.747 --> 02:19.965
that's just one of the things
that doesn't make sense.

02:20.009 --> 02:21.358
- But you know,
you don't have to be funny.

02:21.402 --> 02:22.794
You just have to be real
and authentic

02:22.838 --> 02:23.621
and true to who you are.

02:23.665 --> 02:24.970
- I love that.
- Mm-hmm.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.581
- Great. Um, great.

02:26.624 --> 02:29.279
So why don't you be authentic
and real and all that for me?

02:29.323 --> 02:30.715
- You want me to pretend
to be you?

02:30.759 --> 02:32.281
- Yeah, well, I mean,
just to tweet.

02:32.326 --> 02:33.892
[laughing] You don't have
to wear a skin suit

02:33.936 --> 02:35.067
and [bleep] my husband.

02:35.111 --> 02:36.199
All right, username is

02:36.243 --> 02:37.591
"Katherine Hastings."
- Mm-hmm.

02:37.635 --> 02:40.595
- Okay, what if we make her
the victim...

02:40.638 --> 02:41.987
- Right.
- Rough her up a little bit,

02:42.031 --> 02:44.293
make it seem like
an angry customer attacked her?

02:44.338 --> 02:45.817
- So you want
to Tonya Harding her?

02:45.861 --> 02:48.429
- Yes. That's a good way
of putting it, yes.

02:48.472 --> 02:50.779
- What if we put out a video
of her apologizing,

02:50.822 --> 02:52.954
like, in her house
with her family?

02:52.998 --> 02:55.131
People see her as, like,
a wife and a mother

02:55.175 --> 02:56.480
who's truly sorry
for what happened.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.613
- Mm, so it would
be like, um...

02:58.656 --> 03:00.136
[fake crying]
"I'm so sorry.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.572
"Please love me

03:01.616 --> 03:04.662
and stop sending me
your pubic hairs."

03:04.706 --> 03:07.709
- Yeah, s--so no video.
Mm-kay.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.493
- She has you tweeting for her?

03:09.537 --> 03:10.668
- Yeah, she was having trouble
coming up

03:10.712 --> 03:12.583
with something personal
and authentic.

03:12.627 --> 03:15.847
- Yeah, robots do have a tough
time simulating human emotion,

03:15.891 --> 03:18.372
but the technology's
improving every day, so--

03:18.415 --> 03:19.808
- Okay,
so which one should I post?

03:19.851 --> 03:21.679
- Mm, God, I'd love
to keep figuring this out,

03:21.723 --> 03:23.507
but sadly we've arrived
at my office,

03:23.551 --> 03:24.987
and I'm sure you have work--
- It's okay, I got time.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.815
Would you think she would
post Taylor Swift,

03:26.858 --> 03:29.078
or you think she'd wanna
quote that "Lean In" lady?

03:29.121 --> 03:31.254
Is that more her jam?

03:31.298 --> 03:32.690
Taylor Swift.

03:33.343 --> 03:34.562
- Ooh, another idea would
be having you do

03:34.605 --> 03:35.954
a tree-planting campaign.

03:35.998 --> 03:38.043
- Mm.
Nature stuff's so played out.

03:38.087 --> 03:39.828
What else?
- Okay. Uh, ooh.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.873
We think we could get you
on "Dancing with the Stars."

03:41.917 --> 03:45.616
- Guys, I am not
Jake from State Farm, okay?

03:45.660 --> 03:49.228
I'm looking for ideas that are
simple and timeless and real.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.796
- What about an apology video?

03:51.840 --> 03:53.537
- Apology video?
- Yeah, hear me out.

03:53.581 --> 03:56.192
You at home being sincere
with your family

03:56.236 --> 03:57.585
talking about how bad you feel,

03:57.628 --> 03:59.587
leaning into the image
of you as a mother.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.066
- What do you think, Sadie?

04:01.110 --> 04:03.286
- [clears throat]

04:03.330 --> 04:04.722
What do I think
of an apology video?

04:04.766 --> 04:06.811
- Yeah.
- That's a great question.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.726
Um--maybe I said--

04:08.770 --> 04:10.467
it doesn't matter
who thought of that,

04:10.511 --> 04:11.773
'cause we were brainstorming.

04:11.816 --> 04:14.036
Yeah, maybe
that's a good--maybe.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.385
- Maybe we should just
switch you to a simple

04:15.429 --> 04:16.821
thumbs-up
or thumbs-down system.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.736
Nice work, Ian.
- Thank you.

04:18.779 --> 04:19.911
- Okay, well, what about this?

04:19.954 --> 04:21.391
What about if I write,

04:21.435 --> 04:23.567
"Why do we stop chewing
grape gum when we get older?

04:23.611 --> 04:25.482
Grape gum is fire."

04:25.526 --> 04:26.831
And then I put the fire emoji.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.616
- Not sure you want
to reference fire

04:28.659 --> 04:30.357
after the literal fire
we caused.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.749
- See, that's good. See?

04:31.793 --> 04:33.664
See, that's why you here,
'cause you smart.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.580
Okay, how about "@TacoBell,
bring back those waffle tacos,

04:36.624 --> 04:38.408
you cowards.
#livemás"?

04:38.452 --> 04:39.801
- It all sounds good.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.585
I appreciate--
I appreciate it.

04:41.629 --> 04:42.760
All right, yeah.
- Sorry, what are--

04:42.804 --> 04:45.110
- Come on in. Come on in.
No. Thank you.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.721
I'm sorry.
There's so much stuff going on,

04:46.764 --> 04:48.026
and I don't have an office.

04:48.070 --> 04:49.767
I hope this is okay.

04:49.811 --> 04:52.248
- Uh--yeah, sure.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.728
Mm-kay. Yeah.

04:53.771 --> 04:56.600
I actually--I wanted
to talk to you about something.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.515
- Go for it.
- It's not a big deal,

04:58.558 --> 05:01.518
but, um, when I suggested
that we do that video,

05:01.562 --> 05:04.434
you were--I thought
that you were against it.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.262
But then, like,
you pitched it to Katherine

05:06.306 --> 05:08.960
kind of like it was your idea,
and I'm sure that was just,

05:09.004 --> 05:10.135
like, a misunderstanding.

05:10.179 --> 05:11.441
- No, it wasn't.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.443
- What?
- Taking your idea.

05:13.487 --> 05:14.531
I'm trying to take your job.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.054
Do you want an M&M?

05:16.098 --> 05:19.144
- No, thank you.
No, they're--they're my M&Ms.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.146
What do you mean,
you're trying to take my job?

05:21.190 --> 05:22.452
- Okay, listen, don't judge,

05:22.496 --> 05:24.019
but I realized for the price
of my L.A. condo,

05:24.062 --> 05:25.803
here I could be
like a land baron.

05:25.847 --> 05:28.719
So I figure, get you fired,
take your job,

05:28.763 --> 05:30.895
start looking at,
uh, open houses.

05:30.939 --> 05:32.244
- What the [bleep]?

05:32.288 --> 05:33.768
- Hey, I said don't judge,
and you're judging.

05:33.811 --> 05:36.336
- Well, of course I'm,
uh, judging you.

05:36.379 --> 05:37.554
You're a psychopath.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.991
- Technically diagnosed
as a cluster B,

05:40.034 --> 05:43.255
Axis II narcissist
with psychopathic tendencies.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.997
Usually I'm so good
at mimicking human emotion,

05:46.041 --> 05:47.521
no one has any idea.

05:47.564 --> 05:48.870
- Wait, what?

05:48.913 --> 05:50.654
- Wait, what?

05:50.698 --> 05:52.526
Anyway, hey,
I gotta return a call.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.136
Could you close the door
on your way out?

05:54.179 --> 05:55.267
- On my w--

05:55.311 --> 05:56.486
- Hey.
- This is my o--

05:56.530 --> 05:58.401
- Andrew. Ian Osofsky.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.664
Buddy, making a video
for a client.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.710
I could use your help.
What do you got?

06:04.581 --> 06:04.973
.

06:05.016 --> 06:07.279
- I mean,
he just seems so normal.

06:07.323 --> 06:10.021
- I read that, like, 10%
of executives are psychopaths.

06:10.065 --> 06:11.719
It's what makes them
such effective leaders.

06:11.762 --> 06:14.025
- Well, you can't just
sit back like some simp

06:14.069 --> 06:15.505
and let him take
your job, okay?

06:15.549 --> 06:16.811
To beat a psycho,

06:16.854 --> 06:18.334
you need to think
like a psycho.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.510
[clears throat]
Blood.

06:20.554 --> 06:21.642
"Helter Skelter."

06:21.685 --> 06:23.034
Uh, Jack the Ripper.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.471
- How does this help me?
- Shh.

06:24.514 --> 06:25.559
Uh, Jeffrey Dahmer.

06:25.602 --> 06:26.821
Mark Cuban.

06:26.864 --> 06:27.865
Daymond John.

06:27.909 --> 06:29.214
Lori Greiner.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.738
- These are just people
from "Shark Tank."

06:30.781 --> 06:31.869
Right?
- Yeah.

06:31.913 --> 06:34.306
- The Payne fire is a tragedy

06:34.350 --> 06:35.612
that never should
have happened.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.571
- Okay, can we do something
about the girl?

06:37.614 --> 06:39.877
She looks like someone disabled
her Instagram account.

06:39.921 --> 06:42.271
- Well, it's your video, bro.

06:42.314 --> 06:43.446
- Why are you being weird?

06:43.490 --> 06:44.360
- I'm being weird?

06:44.404 --> 06:46.101
You're trying to get me fired.

06:46.144 --> 06:47.798
- I told you
that is not personal.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.234
It's a medical condition.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.193
Would you be mad
at a blind man who can't see?

06:51.236 --> 06:53.195
No, you would not.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.371
I might be a psychopath,

06:55.415 --> 06:57.068
but you're a not-nice person.

06:58.940 --> 07:00.376
- Damn it!

07:00.420 --> 07:02.117
- What are you doing?
- [sighs]

07:02.160 --> 07:03.945
We're trying
to make Twitter accounts,

07:03.988 --> 07:05.120
but I keep failing
the CAPTCHA tests,

07:05.163 --> 07:07.035
and I'm starting
to question, like,

07:07.078 --> 07:08.297
am I a robot?

07:08.340 --> 07:09.864
- It doesn't matter
what I tweet, Cyrus.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.039
Katherine's got no followers.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.301
And no one's gonna follow her

07:12.344 --> 07:13.650
unless other people
retweet her.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.609
But there's no one
to retweet her--why?

07:15.652 --> 07:17.045
'Cause she ain't got
no followers.

07:17.088 --> 07:19.439
- Ah, so the fake accounts
follow Katherine

07:19.482 --> 07:21.092
so it looks like she has buzz.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.659
- Aha.
- Congrats.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.487
You've launched
a Russian troll farm.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.880
- I found all
the traffic lights.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.403
There are no more
traffic lights.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.970
- Won't it look
a little suspicious

07:29.013 --> 07:31.015
that all of Katherine's
followers signed up for Twitter

07:31.059 --> 07:32.713
on the same day,
followed no one but her,

07:32.756 --> 07:34.062
and have no other interests?

07:34.105 --> 07:35.455
- You think a detective's
on this or something?

07:35.498 --> 07:37.195
We're just trying to trick
a few idiots.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.110
- If you want this to look
like they're real people,

07:39.154 --> 07:40.851
you need to give them depth.

07:40.895 --> 07:43.027
Okay?
Slide over. Slide over.

07:43.071 --> 07:45.639
Let a maestro do
his maestro thing.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.815
- Okay.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.294
- Is a motorcycle a bike?

07:49.338 --> 07:51.383
- [whispers] Do you see
what I'm dealing with?

07:51.427 --> 07:53.473
- There is nothing
more important

07:53.516 --> 07:55.431
than the safety of your family.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.955
And I say that not just
as a CEO,

07:57.999 --> 07:59.304
but as a mother--

07:59.348 --> 08:00.741
- Stepmother.
- A stepmother--

08:00.784 --> 08:02.525
- Maddie, honey.
- [sighs]

08:02.569 --> 08:04.484
Can we--can we take ten?
- On a ten!

08:04.527 --> 08:05.702
- Maddie--
- Thank God.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.138
- I swear to God.
- Richard, would you talk

08:07.182 --> 08:08.618
to your daughter?
- I can--I can talk to her.

08:08.662 --> 08:09.924
- I'll talk to her.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.273
- I'm closer to her age.

08:11.316 --> 08:12.492
- Well, I'm better
at this stuff.

08:12.535 --> 08:13.928
- Dude, why are you trying
to be alone

08:13.971 --> 08:14.972
with a teenage girl?

08:15.016 --> 08:16.539
It's creepy.

08:16.582 --> 08:18.106
- I'll handle it.

08:20.543 --> 08:22.545
Gosh, this is so basic.
[laughs]

08:22.589 --> 08:24.112
Like, I knew
it was gonna be lit,

08:24.155 --> 08:27.637
but it's almost, like...cheugy.

08:27.681 --> 08:30.292
- Thank you for speaking to me
in a lingo I can identify with.

08:30.335 --> 08:31.989
I feel truly seen.

08:32.033 --> 08:35.078
- Sarcasm, yep.

08:35.123 --> 08:37.299
Can you just be cool
for five minutes

08:37.342 --> 08:38.648
so that we can get out of here?

08:38.692 --> 08:39.562
Like, that's all we want.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.172
We just want to get this done

08:41.216 --> 08:43.044
and leave.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.131
- Okay.

08:44.174 --> 08:45.525
Let's just get this over with.

08:45.568 --> 08:46.874
- Right?

08:46.917 --> 08:48.528
Same page. Up high.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.181
- Nope.
I'm not gonna high-five you.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.184
- Hey. [chuckles]

08:53.228 --> 08:55.143
Listen, do not listen to her.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.361
I do not agree.

08:56.405 --> 08:57.711
I think she's the one acting

08:57.754 --> 08:58.842
like a spoiled [bleep].

08:58.886 --> 09:00.540
- She said that about me?

09:00.583 --> 09:02.106
- Yeah, in a group chat
just a second ago.

09:02.150 --> 09:03.847
But look, I tried
to defend you and said,

09:03.891 --> 09:06.676
Sadie, it's not cool to call
a young girl a spoiled [bleep].

09:06.720 --> 09:08.025
It's not right.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.461
- Hey, I worked it out
with Maddie.

09:09.505 --> 09:10.637
- Oh, Sadie, you're amazing.
- Good, thank you.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.160
- All right, everyone,
let's roll.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.422
- We're back, everyone.
Back in five.

09:13.465 --> 09:14.597
- Now.
- Now! Ready now!

09:14.641 --> 09:17.121
- [bleep] everyone.
I'm leaving.

09:17.165 --> 09:19.123
Who's the [bleep] now, [bleep]?

09:19.167 --> 09:20.603
- Hey, Maddie.

09:20.647 --> 09:21.909
Maddie, wait.

09:21.952 --> 09:24.389
- What did you say to her?

09:24.433 --> 09:26.435
- I present
Matthew Rollins, Jr.

09:26.478 --> 09:28.350
Matthew is
a libertarian atheist

09:28.393 --> 09:31.005
doing his engineering post-grad
at San Diego State.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.223
Go Aztecs.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.486
And he's a volunteer
mountain rescuer.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.706
He's also the guy
that just asked,

09:36.750 --> 09:41.232
"If you were an animated car
in that Pixar movie,

09:41.276 --> 09:43.583
what car would you be?"

09:43.626 --> 09:47.935
And got a reply
from Payne Motors CEO,

09:47.978 --> 09:49.632
Katherine Hastings.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.112
[computer chimes]
And thus,

09:51.155 --> 09:52.809
a conversation has begun.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.550
- Oh, and you know who loves to
comment on all things Disney?

09:54.594 --> 09:55.551
- Who? Give me a good name.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.726
- Uh, Sasha.
- Who is she?

09:56.770 --> 09:58.032
- A single mother of two,

09:58.075 --> 09:59.250
colorblindness survivor,

09:59.294 --> 10:01.513
and Minnie Mouse fanatic.
- I love it.

10:01.557 --> 10:04.908
- And there could be
a guy named, like, Boomer.

10:04.952 --> 10:05.996
- [quietly] Yeah.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.258
- What were you saying?
Sasha...

10:07.302 --> 10:08.216
- Sasha, yeah.
- Okay.

10:08.259 --> 10:09.652
- Single mother of two.

10:09.696 --> 10:11.436
- Nope.
She's not at her mom's either.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.655
- She's 17, Richard.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.222
She's probably at
an arcade or something.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.484
- You know,
there's no arcades anymore.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.399
- Yeah, it's all
oxycodone-fueled

10:17.442 --> 10:18.922
sex parties, like "Euphoria."

10:18.966 --> 10:20.663
- Hey, look, I can have another
girl here in 30 minutes.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.709
- You wanna recast
her daughter?

10:22.752 --> 10:24.232
- We never say
it's her daughter.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.755
If people assume
the girl sitting next to her

10:25.799 --> 10:28.062
is her daughter,
then isn't that on them?

10:28.105 --> 10:29.367
- I mean, that's true.
- Wait,

10:29.411 --> 10:31.500
you're actually considering
replacing Maddie?

10:31.543 --> 10:32.719
- Well, as an option.

10:32.762 --> 10:34.459
- How fake can you be?

10:34.503 --> 10:35.765
- [stammers]
- I mean, come on.

10:35.809 --> 10:36.897
This is the most time

10:36.940 --> 10:38.420
that you and I have
spent together...

10:38.463 --> 10:39.726
- Okay, we don't need to--
- In, like, maybe all year.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.684
And it's in this house
that isn't our house.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.468
- Richard--
- And we're making some stupid

10:43.512 --> 10:45.557
video about how real you are.

10:45.601 --> 10:46.558
- I never said this would--
- You--you know what?

10:46.602 --> 10:47.603
You like the fake house
so much,

10:47.647 --> 10:48.952
why don't you just live here,

10:48.996 --> 10:50.954
'cause I'm done, and I'm
going back to our house--

10:50.998 --> 10:52.173
our actual house.

10:54.523 --> 10:56.264
- Hey, look, I hope you don't
blame Sadie for this.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.700
She did the best she could.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.180
[playful music]

11:01.138 --> 11:01.356
.

11:01.399 --> 11:04.011
- The safety of your family
means everything to me.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.535
- Does it?
[audience laughter]

11:06.578 --> 11:08.885
Does it really?

11:08.929 --> 11:10.495
I can't help thinking
something feels

11:10.539 --> 11:12.236
a little inauthentic
about that apology.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.890
Why is that? Oh, right.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.284
It's because
that's not her house.

11:16.327 --> 11:20.331
It's a set where they shot
a T-Mobile commercial.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.639
- T-Mobile, not gonna lie,

11:23.683 --> 11:25.032
that one kind of stings.

11:25.075 --> 11:26.381
- Okay, you know what,
I wanted to shoot it

11:26.424 --> 11:27.904
in a different location--
- Actually, I think that

11:27.948 --> 11:29.384
you wanted to shoot there.
- I don't think it's really

11:29.427 --> 11:30.820
important who said what, Sadie.
- I'm gonna go vape

11:30.864 --> 11:32.735
until I'm numb,
and when I get back,

11:32.779 --> 11:34.432
I need a new list of ideas,

11:34.476 --> 11:37.522
ideally ones that don't make me
into a national embarrassment.

11:37.566 --> 11:38.872
Okay?

11:38.915 --> 11:40.874
- Gavin Marvin Pendergrass.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.092
- Ooh.
- He's erudite...

11:42.136 --> 11:44.094
- Ah.
- Sophisticated, super likable.

11:44.138 --> 11:45.617
You know, he's an intellectual,

11:45.661 --> 11:47.837
but he also owns a jet ski.

11:47.881 --> 11:48.795
[whispers]
I should buy a jet ski.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.013
- Okay, I see your Gavin,

11:50.057 --> 11:51.928
and I raise you Kiana George.
- Who?

11:51.972 --> 11:53.190
- You see,
she's a fierce Black woman

11:53.234 --> 11:54.757
who loves sushi
and cozy mysteries.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.716
And she got IBS, but she don't
let that define her.

11:56.759 --> 11:57.847
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

11:57.891 --> 11:58.848
- What are you guys doing?
- Ooh,

11:58.892 --> 11:59.936
working on your
Twitter account.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.416
- It's not just
an account anymore.

12:01.459 --> 12:04.724
It's a whole Katherine Hastings
Cinematic Universe.

12:04.767 --> 12:05.768
- You wanna read some of these?

12:05.812 --> 12:07.204
- Uh, no. I get it.

12:07.248 --> 12:09.250
Emojicons, eggplants.
We're good.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.513
- Okay.
- Carry on.

12:11.556 --> 12:13.384
- If I'm being honest,
the Katherine character

12:13.428 --> 12:15.386
is becoming my least favorite.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.388
- Central characters
are always boring.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.956
She's just a giant piece
of flavorless meat

12:20.000 --> 12:22.089
with no seasoning.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.049
- You're not pitching anything?

12:26.093 --> 12:27.572
- Nope,
'cause I know Katherine.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.574
She'll wanna take a beat
and reassess.

12:29.618 --> 12:32.012
She doesn't wanna jump
into another bad decision.

12:32.055 --> 12:34.492
- Hm.
- So what have we come up with?

12:34.536 --> 12:35.929
- You know what, I think it's
important at a time like this

12:35.972 --> 12:37.495
to take a beat,
you know, reassess.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.540
We don't want to rush
into another bad decision

12:39.584 --> 12:40.890
where it could blow up
in our faces.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.805
- No. I hate just waiting.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.242
This isn't the time
to sit around doing nothing,

12:45.286 --> 12:47.984
like a condom
in Nick Cannon's wallet.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.770
- I totally agree, and I've
been trying to tell him that.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.075
We need to be proactive.

12:52.119 --> 12:55.818
I thought maybe we could
get you on "Seth Meyers"

12:55.862 --> 12:57.994
and just, like, show
that you're in on the joke.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.691
- Sit down
with my biggest critic?

12:59.735 --> 13:00.867
That's, uh...
- Stupid.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.694
- Ballsy.
If people see us joking around

13:02.738 --> 13:04.609
like old pals, I mean,
then it's okay to like me.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.829
- You know, I'm just--I'm just
worried about, you know,

13:06.873 --> 13:08.439
not seeming like
a serious person.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.441
And plus, it'd take months
to get booked on that show.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.792
- Well, I actually, uh--
I got a slot on Thursday,

13:12.835 --> 13:13.923
if you want.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.533
- Really? Book it.

13:15.577 --> 13:16.970
Nice work, Sadie.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.841
Oh, and book me really good
hair and makeup.

13:18.885 --> 13:19.929
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

13:19.973 --> 13:23.454
[playful music]

13:23.498 --> 13:25.282
- So I hear we're both
from New Hampshire.

13:25.326 --> 13:26.980
- Uh, well,
we moved when I was six,

13:27.023 --> 13:29.156
but I still got
some Hampsha' in me.

13:29.199 --> 13:30.810
- All right, pop quiz:
the thing in the wall

13:30.853 --> 13:32.072
you drink water from,
what's that called?

13:32.115 --> 13:33.856
- Oh, that's a--
that's a "bubblah," yeah.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.205
[New Hampshire accent]
That's a bubbler, yeah,

13:35.249 --> 13:36.250
we got some wicked good
water in those.

13:36.293 --> 13:37.294
- We got wicked good watah.

13:37.338 --> 13:38.818
- It's going really well, huh?

13:38.861 --> 13:40.297
[chuckles]
- It's fine.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.255
- We gotta head up
to the, uh--

13:41.298 --> 13:42.386
to the White Mountains--

13:42.430 --> 13:43.431
- The light's
catching her great,

13:43.474 --> 13:45.215
hitting all the curves.
- Mm.

13:45.259 --> 13:46.651
- So Benny and Natasha,

13:46.695 --> 13:48.349
they're tweeting snarky
comments at each other

13:48.392 --> 13:49.959
about Trump, right,
going back and forth.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.874
But if you put
the politics aside,

13:51.918 --> 13:53.093
they're not so different.

13:53.136 --> 13:54.790
- Ooh, what about
if later on down the line

13:54.834 --> 13:57.445
we have them realize that,
and then they start a romance?

13:57.488 --> 13:58.707
- We should do that.
Let's workshop it,

13:58.750 --> 13:59.969
'cause it's important.
- Political, sexy--

14:00.013 --> 14:01.666
- Y'all are wild.

14:01.710 --> 14:02.929
- What?
- As of this morning,

14:02.972 --> 14:04.191
Katherine has
over ten thousand followers.

14:04.234 --> 14:05.670
- Right! Go us!
- It's catching on.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.498
All right. But who is
your favorite character, Jack?

14:07.542 --> 14:10.588
See, I bet it was TJ, right,
'cause TJ comes to play.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.503
Right, TJ's an amalgam
of characters

14:12.547 --> 14:14.636
that I've experienced
in my own life--

14:14.679 --> 14:16.986
- TJ is cool, but I got to go
with Anita, man.

14:17.030 --> 14:18.074
- Ooh! She's one of mine.

14:18.118 --> 14:19.510
I love Anita. That's me.

14:19.554 --> 14:20.642
- Well, actually,
we came up with her together

14:20.685 --> 14:22.426
I said nurse--
- The stuff Anita says

14:22.470 --> 14:24.167
is so specific.
- Aww.

14:24.211 --> 14:25.342
- Girl, you need to be
a writer.

14:25.386 --> 14:26.474
- [gasps]
- Yeah, I honestly

14:26.517 --> 14:27.954
couldn't even tell
Anita was fake.

14:27.997 --> 14:30.217
- You couldn't tell
a motorcycle from a bike, Jack.

14:31.827 --> 14:32.915
- [New Hampshire accent]
Next time we're back,

14:32.959 --> 14:34.003
we're gonna take the beater,

14:34.047 --> 14:35.352
we're gonna go
for a packie run,

14:35.396 --> 14:36.876
you know, I'll--
I'll bang a U-ie,

14:36.919 --> 14:38.399
and then, uh, we'll go fishing
for some hornpout.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.357
- All right,
that sounds like a plan.

14:40.401 --> 14:41.750
We'll be right back with more

14:41.793 --> 14:43.883
from Katherine Hastings
after this.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.754
[audience applause]

14:45.797 --> 14:48.800
- [chuckling]

14:48.844 --> 14:49.845
[clears throat]

14:49.889 --> 14:52.282
[indistinct chatter]

14:52.326 --> 14:54.241
[normal voice]
I'm such a big fan, by the way.

14:54.284 --> 14:55.764
- Thank you.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.113
- All the jokes you've
been doing about me,

14:57.157 --> 14:58.114
they're so funny.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.289
You know, they sting,

14:59.333 --> 15:00.377
but you know,
it's in a good way.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.075
It's in a good way.
I appreciate it.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.990
I just think it's nice that
we can show people that we're--

15:04.033 --> 15:06.818
- Um, look, uh,
I don't like you.

15:06.862 --> 15:08.908
I mean,
you endangered people's lives.

15:08.951 --> 15:12.085
And, uh, I didn't wanna
have you on the show tonight.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.390
It's just that the network
thought

15:13.434 --> 15:14.914
you would be good ratings.

15:14.957 --> 15:18.221
But don't pretend this is
some sort of showbiz rivalry,

15:18.265 --> 15:21.921
because I hope you go
to prison.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.444
- Huh.

15:25.837 --> 15:26.012
.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.927
- So you've been having
a tough month.

15:27.970 --> 15:28.971
- "Fortune" magazine named you

15:29.015 --> 15:31.365
the "Most Hated CEO
in America."

15:31.408 --> 15:32.757
I mean, that's gotta sting.
- Yeah.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.281
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

15:34.324 --> 15:36.326
Well, I'm just glad that
they named me at all, you know?

15:36.370 --> 15:39.329
"The Journal" just calls me
"She Who Must Not Be Named."

15:39.373 --> 15:40.896
[laughs]

15:40.940 --> 15:42.289
You know, like, um, Voldemort.

15:42.332 --> 15:44.987
- Yeah, yeah, "Harry Potter."
Yeah, we get it.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.163
- Yike-sters.
Why is she being so thirsty?

15:47.207 --> 15:48.686
- I don't know.
Something's off.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.645
- [English accent] Set fire
to the Quidditch pitch.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.429
- Cringe city.
I am so glad

15:52.473 --> 15:55.519
I'm not the one
that suggested she do this.

15:55.563 --> 15:58.783
- Dori, what is Eliza gonna do
about that snake in her toilet?

15:58.827 --> 16:00.481
- Only Eliza knows
the answer to that.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.700
I let my characters tell me
what they wanna do.

16:02.744 --> 16:03.701
I just write it down.

16:03.745 --> 16:06.095
- So Eliza wanted you

16:06.139 --> 16:08.054
to tweet about her favorite
mixology bar,

16:08.097 --> 16:10.578
even though she's a devout
Mormon that doesn't drink?

16:10.621 --> 16:11.971
Seems inconsistent.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.929
- People are inconsistent,
Cyrus.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.888
Inconsistencies are what
give my characters depth.

16:16.932 --> 16:18.890
- Personally,
I thought it added

16:18.934 --> 16:20.066
a whole new dimension to her--

16:20.109 --> 16:21.676
- I just think
that you're so focused

16:21.719 --> 16:23.156
on being funny
and controversial

16:23.199 --> 16:25.506
that you're sacrificing
rich character development--

16:25.549 --> 16:28.639
- Cyrus, I have taken up
too much of your time.

16:28.683 --> 16:31.425
Really, I have. And I know
you've got work to do.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.037
- Well, I'm taking
my accounts with me.

16:35.081 --> 16:37.953
- Oh, no, what'll I ever do
without all the characters

16:37.997 --> 16:40.303
you clearly stole
from "Our Town"?

16:40.347 --> 16:41.783
Yeah, you think
I didn't notice?

16:41.826 --> 16:43.437
- That got intense fast.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.353
- Some people don't handle
other people's success well.

16:46.396 --> 16:48.355
- Well, Seth, um,
you've been going after me

16:48.398 --> 16:49.965
pretty hard, um, lately.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.229
So in fact, I snuck
into your writer's room,

16:53.273 --> 16:55.753
um, and I, uh,
grabbed some of the jokes

16:55.797 --> 16:59.583
that you were going to be doing
about me tomorrow on the show.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.890
- Gosh, you know, I think it's
going really, really badly.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.284
- Hey, Hannibal Lector,
no one asked for your opinion.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.807
- Okay, you know,
Hannibal's a problematic

17:05.849 --> 17:07.200
character in our community.

17:07.242 --> 17:08.810
They should have had one
of us play the role, but--

17:08.853 --> 17:10.768
[chuckles]
Hollywood.

17:10.811 --> 17:12.509
- "According to a poll,

17:12.553 --> 17:16.644
92% of Americans dislike
Katherine Hastings."

17:16.686 --> 17:17.732
Oh. [laughs]

17:17.775 --> 17:19.516
"While the other
8% were run over

17:19.560 --> 17:22.606
by their Hydras and couldn't
respond to the survey."

17:22.650 --> 17:23.781
- [laughing] Oh.

17:23.825 --> 17:24.868
That one was harsh.
- Yeah.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.175
- You're gonna find
another job.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.742
I--I can recommend you
to an escort service,

17:27.785 --> 17:29.135
and I think you'd do great
while you're young and still,

17:29.178 --> 17:30.440
you know, kind of pretty.

17:30.484 --> 17:31.441
- Lay off her, man.

17:31.485 --> 17:32.616
- Wesley, it's fine.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.009
- No, I--I'm sick
of him coming after you.

17:34.053 --> 17:38.274
This woman, this beautiful,
kind, classy woman,

17:38.318 --> 17:40.276
she would crush as an escort.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.278
- Okay, that's not--
- No, it's--it's true.

17:42.322 --> 17:43.627
You would, I swear to God.
- Wesley, don't help.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.673
Don't help.

17:45.716 --> 17:47.849
- You'd be very good.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.285
- Thanks.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.157
- [laughing]

17:51.200 --> 17:53.724
I'm cracking myself up.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.509
[computer chimes]

17:55.552 --> 17:58.077
[exhales]

17:58.120 --> 18:00.557
Y'all, I made Katherine
a conspiracy nut.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.472
- What?
- I have this character, Kyle,

18:02.516 --> 18:05.127
who's a crazy QAnon guy,
and I was doing this whole run

18:05.171 --> 18:07.651
about UFOs and, like,
Tom Hank's butthole and stuff.

18:07.695 --> 18:10.263
And I realized I was
on Katherine's account.

18:10.306 --> 18:11.481
- No.
- Wait, can't you just

18:11.525 --> 18:12.830
delete the tweets?
- Yeah, 'cause that's

18:12.874 --> 18:14.441
how the Internet works.
You just delete stuff,

18:14.484 --> 18:15.920
and no one ever
digs it up again.

18:15.964 --> 18:17.226
- Well, what if we say
she was hacked?

18:17.270 --> 18:18.836
Right, that happens
all the time.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.011
Like, we could
start posting a bunch

18:20.055 --> 18:21.796
of racist, homophobic stuff.

18:21.839 --> 18:23.319
Quick, Jack,
get me some [bleep] pics.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.364
- You talking about
from the Internet,

18:24.407 --> 18:25.843
or you--you talking about
from me?

18:25.887 --> 18:27.367
- It's your call, baby.

18:27.410 --> 18:29.630
- There's some crazy stuff
on here though, yo, really.

18:29.673 --> 18:30.935
[audience laughter]

18:30.979 --> 18:33.764
- "Payne reportedly considered
firing Hastings,

18:33.808 --> 18:37.855
"but Ford offered her a job
as a crash test dummy.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.335
[audience laughter]

18:39.379 --> 18:42.773
"I'm not saying she's dumb,
just that she's fake

18:42.817 --> 18:45.559
and a lot of people want
to see her drive into a wall."

18:45.602 --> 18:47.169
[audience laughter]

18:47.213 --> 18:49.345
A lot here about how much
everyone hates me.

18:49.389 --> 18:51.217
Don't feel like
there's a lot of variety.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.132
- [laughing] Hey, I don't
come to your workplace

18:53.175 --> 18:55.090
and tell you how to cover up
defective cars.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.961
[audience laughter]
- Well, yeah,

18:57.005 --> 18:58.746
a lot of, um--
a lot of these are--

18:58.789 --> 19:01.618
are pretty real actually, yeah.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.926
I mean, people hate me.

19:04.969 --> 19:05.970
Try to pretend
it doesn't bother me,

19:06.014 --> 19:09.322
but it does.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.802
- Well, look, you know,
thanks for being a good sport.

19:11.846 --> 19:12.934
Thank you for being here.
Kath--

19:12.977 --> 19:13.891
- Do you know
that someone literally

19:13.935 --> 19:15.980
sent me a box of pubes?

19:16.024 --> 19:17.547
It was--
it was a big box,

19:17.591 --> 19:19.288
like what a toaster
would come in.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.421
I mean, more--
more pubes than really one--

19:21.464 --> 19:23.466
one person could make, unless
they were storing them up.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.947
But you know what,
I don't blame 'em.

19:25.990 --> 19:28.645
I'd probably send me
a box of pubes, too.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.735
I messed up, you know?

19:31.779 --> 19:36.392
No apology video or--or talk
show appearance can make up

19:36.436 --> 19:39.352
for what I did, and you know,
I can't fix it.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.223
But what I can do is promise

19:41.267 --> 19:44.531
that it will never
happen again.

19:47.055 --> 19:50.145
[audience applause]

19:50.189 --> 19:53.017
- Amen to that.
Katherine Hastings, everybody.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.454
We'll be right back.

19:54.497 --> 19:57.457
[band playing]

19:59.285 --> 20:00.416
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

20:00.460 --> 20:03.027
but that was actually
pretty great.

20:03.071 --> 20:04.594
- You know what,
go [bleep] yourself, Seth.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.683
Next time,
I'm going on "Kimmel."

20:06.727 --> 20:07.945
- Can't blame you.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.773
[all cheering]

20:09.817 --> 20:11.601
- Did you see Seth's face?

20:11.645 --> 20:13.342
I mean, I think
he actually felt bad.

20:13.386 --> 20:14.517
- Mm-hmm.
- And maybe

20:14.561 --> 20:15.866
a little in love with me.
- Mm.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.564
I think anyone who sees that
is gonna love you.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.870
- And red America loves
the QAnon tweets,

20:19.914 --> 20:21.132
so you're hitting
all the demos.

20:21.176 --> 20:22.133
- Wait, what QAnon tweets?

20:22.177 --> 20:23.396
- It's a long story.

20:23.439 --> 20:24.527
- You know,
I knew you'd pull it off.

20:24.571 --> 20:25.963
I kept saying,
believe in Katherine--

20:26.007 --> 20:27.269
- He's a liar.

20:27.313 --> 20:28.618
- I don't lie.
- Yes, you do.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.316
Yes, you do.
You lie all the time.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.231
He lies all the time.
And he's trying

20:32.274 --> 20:34.145
to steal Sadie's job
and take credit for her ideas.

20:34.189 --> 20:36.147
And he's a psychopath.
And he's a bully.

20:36.191 --> 20:38.019
And he's mean. And I hate him.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.326
- Hey.

20:40.369 --> 20:42.284
- Okay.
Well, I'm, um--

20:42.328 --> 20:44.460
I'm sorry
that he was mean to you.

20:44.504 --> 20:46.767
But, um, his job here is done,

20:46.810 --> 20:49.117
so you really won't
have to see him anymore.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.206
- Oh.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.295
Okay, oh, yeah.
Yeah, of course.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.166
You know, now that I've
resolved this issue,

20:55.210 --> 20:57.212
I guess
Mary Poppins just moves on

20:57.256 --> 20:58.735
to some more children
that need me to help them.

20:58.779 --> 21:01.129
- Okay? You feel better now?

21:01.172 --> 21:02.957
- Uh-huh.
- Bye, Mary.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.567
It's been a pleasure.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.964
- [sucks teeth]

21:10.007 --> 21:11.487
- How gross was that?
- Yeah.

21:11.531 --> 21:14.577
- "Katherine, Ian's
being mean to Sadie."

21:14.621 --> 21:16.840
- I can handle
my own problems, Wesley.

21:16.884 --> 21:18.494
- I hate a tattletale.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.322
It's, like, just so hard
to respect a person

21:20.366 --> 21:21.497
when they're being
a whiny little bitch, you know?

21:21.541 --> 21:23.717
- Totally.
It's not a good look.
