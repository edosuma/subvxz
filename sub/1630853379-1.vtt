00:38.750 --> 00:41.875
In any story,
if it's a good story,

00:42.458 --> 00:44.250
there is that which is seen

00:44.750 --> 00:46.458
and that which is hidden.

00:49.291 --> 00:52.791
This is especially true in stories of war.

01:04.250 --> 01:05.958
There is the war we see,

01:06.458 --> 01:09.083
a contest of bombs and bullets,

01:10.208 --> 01:12.541
courage, sacrifice,

01:13.041 --> 01:14.541
and brute force.

01:15.041 --> 01:16.541
As we count the winners,

01:17.041 --> 01:17.875
the losers,

01:18.541 --> 01:19.541
and the dead.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.583
Now, men! Heave!

01:31.916 --> 01:34.041
But alongside this war,

01:34.125 --> 01:36.333
another war is waged.

01:36.833 --> 01:39.625
A battleground in shades of gray,

01:40.125 --> 01:41.708
played out in deception,

01:42.208 --> 01:43.250
seduction,

01:43.750 --> 01:45.000
and bad faith.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.333
The participants are strange.

01:51.333 --> 01:53.166
They are seldom what they seem,

01:53.833 --> 01:55.750
and fiction and reality blur.

01:58.250 --> 02:01.791
This war is a wilderness of mirrors

02:02.916 --> 02:04.375
in which the truth

02:04.458 --> 02:07.458
is protected by a bodyguard of lies.

02:08.833 --> 02:10.375
For the love of Christ.

02:11.916 --> 02:13.333
We should've heard by now.

02:15.916 --> 02:17.875
This is our war.

02:35.250 --> 02:36.250
Dear God.

03:07.958 --> 03:08.791
Pray.

03:47.916 --> 03:51.625
As I looked up
into the darkened sky and made a vow,

03:52.750 --> 03:56.166
I would give the old country
another day to fit me into something,

03:56.666 --> 03:58.083
and if nothing happened,

03:58.166 --> 04:00.166
I would take the next boat for the Cape.

04:01.250 --> 04:05.125
It was then,
as I was fitting my key into the door,

04:05.208 --> 04:07.375
I noticed a man at my elbow.

04:07.916 --> 04:11.833
I'd not seen him approach.
And his sudden appearance made me start.

04:12.916 --> 04:16.083
"May I come in for a minute?"
the man said,

04:16.166 --> 04:17.791
steadying his voice with effort.

04:17.875 --> 04:20.750
And if it were us, Omega,
would we let him in?

04:20.833 --> 04:23.500
Depends on whether or not
he knew the code, Agent Zed.

04:24.541 --> 04:25.875
No sooner was he through the door…

04:25.958 --> 04:27.625
He did let him in.

04:27.708 --> 04:30.833
…when the odd-little man
poured himself a stiff whiskey,

04:31.708 --> 04:33.208
drank it in three gulps.

04:34.250 --> 04:35.333
"Pardon," he said.

04:36.041 --> 04:37.583
"I'm a bit rattled tonight."

04:37.666 --> 04:42.125
"You see, I happen
at this moment to be dead."

04:44.416 --> 04:46.625
I think it's best we keep reading.

04:46.708 --> 04:48.833
Tomorrow's a day of high adventure, Agent.

04:48.916 --> 04:51.291
I think it's best you sleep.

04:55.333 --> 04:56.458
They're here.

04:58.041 --> 04:58.875
Good night.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.625
This gorgeous delicacy
is Afghan cheese

05:09.708 --> 05:13.333
made from the milk
of a long-horned and lovesick sheep.

05:13.416 --> 05:15.291
You must be a smuggler, Ivor.

05:15.791 --> 05:18.166
Exotic cheese, the rest of us on rations.

05:18.833 --> 05:21.000
I could manage
your front office, you know,

05:21.500 --> 05:22.625
at the Cheese Eaters League.

05:22.708 --> 05:25.666
Has my brother left you unemployed,
Hester, now that he's retiring?

05:25.750 --> 05:26.916
Oh, is that the rumor?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I hope that's not
the reason for this party.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.416
Are you not retiring?

05:30.500 --> 05:32.791
I've written a lovely speech
saying you are.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.500
Well, then I suggest you write
a lovely speech saying that I am not.

05:35.583 --> 05:37.625
This is simply a hiatus.

05:37.708 --> 05:39.750
Naval supplies.
He's off to whip them into shape.

05:39.833 --> 05:42.166
A noble contribution to this ghastly war.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.375
Maritime hardware.
I have a passion for it.

05:44.875 --> 05:46.458
Ivor, Ewen.

05:46.958 --> 05:49.041
-I'm afraid it's that time.
-That it is, darling.

05:49.125 --> 05:52.125
-I have prepared a dazzling toast.
-Oh.

05:53.208 --> 05:56.166
Though why we're not cheering you
on your last night home--

05:56.250 --> 05:58.041
Oh, don't be silly.
King's Council deserves

05:58.125 --> 05:59.500
a proper sendoff into retirement.

05:59.583 --> 06:02.958
Hester, will you tell my husband
his guests await him.

06:03.750 --> 06:06.250
Absurd, isn't it? This retirement bit.

06:07.083 --> 06:10.708
When both of us know my brother
hasn't tried a case in three years.

06:11.208 --> 06:14.875
When gossip has it, he's been
knee-deep in intelligence for some time.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.958
-Ivor.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.375
A grown man, gossiping like a fishwife.

06:20.458 --> 06:22.708
Has he been bumped over to MI5?

06:22.791 --> 06:25.333
-A special mission?
-Oh, my cue.

06:25.833 --> 06:26.666
I see.

06:26.750 --> 06:30.250
Surely he's taking you with him,
whatever it is.

06:30.333 --> 06:33.083
You really do
have an uncanny nose for cheese.

06:33.791 --> 06:36.000
To my
distinguished friends and colleagues,

06:36.083 --> 06:38.916
in whose honor we have uncorked a vintage…

06:39.416 --> 06:40.250
spam.

06:41.375 --> 06:45.875
A devious cabal of immediate family
has billed this as my retirement,

06:46.375 --> 06:49.916
but you, my cherished guests,
are clever enough to know

06:50.000 --> 06:53.625
that I will be buried in my silks
before I will ever hang them up for good.

06:55.041 --> 06:58.791
So, let us instead consider this
a cheers to my now full-time post

06:58.875 --> 07:01.291
as superintendent of nautical rivets

07:02.208 --> 07:04.250
and whatever
nuts and bolts may be required

07:04.333 --> 07:06.583
by dear England in her hour of need.

07:08.125 --> 07:10.416
But the real tribute tonight goes to Iris,

07:10.916 --> 07:13.291
my brilliant wife, who in the morning

07:13.375 --> 07:16.041
sails to less troubled shores
with our nestlings in tow.

07:17.416 --> 07:19.041
Iris is wiser than Solomon,

07:19.958 --> 07:21.291
stronger than Samson,

07:22.125 --> 07:23.416
and more patient than Job.

07:25.541 --> 07:27.458
But she has to be. She's married to me.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.291
In the Moroccan city of Casablanca,

07:41.375 --> 07:44.583
Prime Minister Churchill
has held meetings with President Roosevelt

07:44.666 --> 07:46.958
to agree on plans
for the next stage of the war.

07:47.458 --> 07:50.666
As Hitler's Nazis
tighten their grip on occupied Europe,

07:50.750 --> 07:52.666
a mighty host of Allied troops…

07:52.750 --> 07:53.583
Excuse me.

07:54.208 --> 07:58.000
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

07:58.958 --> 08:00.541
Excuse me. Thank you.

08:00.625 --> 08:03.583
…and prepare for the battle that will
decide the fate of the free world.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.416
In the words of
President Franklin Roosevelt,

08:07.916 --> 08:11.458
"The fascists asked for it,
and they're going to get it."

08:11.541 --> 08:13.666
We work together if I'm not mistaken.

08:14.750 --> 08:15.833
You're not mistaken.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.666
Have you seen the main feature,

08:22.750 --> 08:24.291
Confessions of a Nazi Spy?

08:25.916 --> 08:27.833
It's, um-- it's based on a real, um,

08:28.333 --> 08:30.916
FBI agent Leon G. Turrou,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.625
T-U-R-R-O-U, who tracked

08:33.708 --> 08:36.583
Nazi spy rings
in the United States in 1938

08:36.666 --> 08:41.625
and went on, amazingly, to arrest
a number of Germans for espionage.

08:41.708 --> 08:43.458
Sorry, I'm late.

08:44.541 --> 08:45.791
I'll let you watch.

08:57.541 --> 09:00.583
It was very gracious,
what you said tonight.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.416
More gracious than it needed to be.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.916
I meant every word.

09:05.833 --> 09:08.916
And I didn't mean for it
to hurt you this way, my leaving.

09:09.625 --> 09:11.708
It seems I'm always the last to go.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.583
-Stronger than Samson.

09:19.666 --> 09:21.125
We're off first thing in the morning.

09:21.208 --> 09:23.291
-And I haven't finished packing.
-Well, up you go then.

09:23.791 --> 09:26.166
-Safe journey, my dear.
-I will write to you.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.583
We'll write to each other.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.208
They have to go.

09:42.625 --> 09:43.708
Of course they do.

09:44.416 --> 09:47.541
If Hitler reaches London, a Jewish family
will be the first on their list.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.458
I would never expose Iris
and the children to that danger.

09:51.541 --> 09:53.458
A separation made all the more painful

09:54.916 --> 09:56.958
if it were to become permanent.

09:58.666 --> 09:59.958
She told you?

10:02.916 --> 10:04.833
I pleaded my case many times…

10:06.833 --> 10:08.875
for our family, for the marriage.

10:11.416 --> 10:13.541
Iris says marriages change, that…

10:14.666 --> 10:16.875
romance and love belong to the young.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.000
I don't believe that

10:19.833 --> 10:21.000
or feel it.

10:22.708 --> 10:25.041
And the thought
they may never be coming back…

10:30.250 --> 10:31.750
I know I can be remote,

10:33.500 --> 10:34.708
lost in my work…

10:36.708 --> 10:38.208
not as attentive as I might be.

10:38.291 --> 10:40.666
You're an imperfect person.
I doubt you're the first.

10:40.750 --> 10:42.166
I want Iris to be happy,

10:42.875 --> 10:44.958
even if it comes at
the expense of my own happiness.

10:45.041 --> 10:47.333
I've never heard her
say a word about unhappiness.

10:47.416 --> 10:50.125
That's because she knows
you'd jump on a grenade for me.

10:50.625 --> 10:51.958
Only on your good days.

10:55.916 --> 10:58.625
Iris said if I really cared,
I'd come to America with them.

10:58.708 --> 11:00.583
Oh, people say all sorts of things.

11:02.333 --> 11:06.083
She knows your duty is to your family
and your country.

11:08.083 --> 11:10.500
The nightmare marching this way
is only too real.

11:11.208 --> 11:13.666
And Masterman has asked me
to serve on The Twenty Committee.

11:15.125 --> 11:16.083
So you must.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.583
Starting tomorrow.

11:27.666 --> 11:28.750
Goodbye, darlings.

11:32.416 --> 11:34.375
All right, now. That's it. That's it.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.666
Godspeed, darling.

11:40.291 --> 11:43.083
Our family manor
will be a freezing tomb without you.

11:43.166 --> 11:46.000
Take care of your brother,
Ivor, and yourself.

12:09.958 --> 12:10.875
It's cold.

12:11.375 --> 12:13.583
I will see to a fresh pot immediately.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.500
They will drag me back
to the bowels any moment.

12:18.083 --> 12:20.666
Fresh air, such a luxury now.

12:20.750 --> 12:21.583
Let's walk.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.416
Everyone but a bloody fool
will know it's Sicily.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.333
That may be, Prime Minister,
but it is the only path forward,

12:30.416 --> 12:32.583
given that we must find a way into Europe.

12:33.250 --> 12:35.416
And the most strategic path is Sicily.

12:35.916 --> 12:36.916
It leads to Rome.

12:37.458 --> 12:40.333
France will follow.
A successful assault on Sicily

12:40.833 --> 12:42.833
means we will knock Italy out of the war,

12:42.916 --> 12:46.208
shatter Nazi morale, and spell
the beginning of their inevitable doom.

12:46.291 --> 12:48.375
Inevitable? Our losses mount daily.

12:48.875 --> 12:51.833
As you said yourself, sir,
"Sicily is the soft underbelly."

12:51.916 --> 12:53.083
I know what I said.

12:54.375 --> 12:58.083
I want to know how it will be achieved,
convincing Herr Hitler we're not gonna do

12:58.166 --> 13:00.916
what anyone with a bloody atlas
can see we'll do.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.250
Hitler will need to believe
that our next target is Greece,

13:04.750 --> 13:07.875
which, yes,
will require an elaborate deception.

13:08.541 --> 13:10.041
A deception plan so complex

13:10.125 --> 13:12.541
I believe it can only be handled
by The Twenty Committee.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.125
Which is why I shall focus the committee's
attention on the "Trout Memo,"

13:16.250 --> 13:18.625
the document I compiled a few years ago,

13:19.416 --> 13:20.625
to which my assistant,

13:20.708 --> 13:23.083
Lieutenant Commander
Ian Fleming, made some contribution.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.083
"Intelligence is like trout fishing."

13:26.666 --> 13:30.208
"The trout fisher, in tying his lure,
attempts to attract the fish."

13:30.291 --> 13:31.125
I detest fish.

13:31.708 --> 13:34.416
Well, fish as metaphor, in this case.

13:35.125 --> 13:39.541
Uh, the Trout Memo
is a definitive blueprint for spy-craft.

13:39.625 --> 13:40.875
Prime Minister, the memo

13:40.958 --> 13:42.791
in the hands of The Twenty Committee

13:42.875 --> 13:45.291
may, I believe,
hold the key to deceiving Hitler.

13:45.375 --> 13:47.833
And while some of the ideas
may appear fantastic--

13:47.916 --> 13:49.333
I applaud the fantastic.

13:50.208 --> 13:52.583
It has many advantages over the mundane.

13:53.125 --> 13:56.291
But the more fantastic,
the more foolproof the plan must be.

13:57.541 --> 14:00.166
Our troops are near dead
from heat in Africa.

14:00.250 --> 14:02.916
I gave Roosevelt my word Sicily was next.

14:03.833 --> 14:06.250
An invasion date of July
is now set in stone.

14:06.958 --> 14:10.833
And right now, thousands of our boys
already lie in Europe's soil.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.958
If we do not fool the Nazis,

14:14.041 --> 14:16.708
and the enemy is
waiting for us on those beaches…

14:18.666 --> 14:21.416
history herself
will avert her eyes from the slaughter.

14:30.291 --> 14:31.333
Mother?

14:31.416 --> 14:34.708
Mother, please do not touch
the dolomite while I'm at work.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.000
A lobe in one of the cams is missing.

14:37.708 --> 14:40.541
I don't have time to find it now,
but haven't we learned

14:40.625 --> 14:42.958
that an overhead camshaft
is virtually useless

14:43.458 --> 14:45.166
without its properly functioning mate?

14:45.666 --> 14:48.000
You might worry about
finding your own mate.

14:48.083 --> 14:49.875
I hope to return with sugar cubes.

14:51.541 --> 14:52.416
And Robbie?

14:53.750 --> 14:55.791
Have you had success
in bringing Robbie home?

14:55.875 --> 14:58.458
-I'm doing all that I can.
-Pulling strings like you promised?

14:58.541 --> 15:02.250
-Every string within grasp.
-A real-life war hero.

15:05.083 --> 15:06.625
And where is Chittagong?

15:06.708 --> 15:07.541
Bengal.

15:14.875 --> 15:19.083


15:23.000 --> 15:27.166


15:27.250 --> 15:29.083
Good God, what's he doing here?

15:29.583 --> 15:31.583
Montagu? I invited him.

15:32.541 --> 15:33.666
That was a mistake.

15:35.416 --> 15:38.541
The main deception we will
feed the Nazis will run as follows.

15:39.166 --> 15:42.166
Our Twelfth Army, which does not exist,

15:42.250 --> 15:44.833
with its 12 divisions,
which also do not exist,

15:44.916 --> 15:47.458
will invade Greece six months from now,

15:47.958 --> 15:49.333
on the 10th of July.

15:49.416 --> 15:52.833
We will develop numerous tactics
to reinforce this deception,

15:52.916 --> 15:55.791
bogus troop movements, fake radio traffic.

15:55.875 --> 15:59.083
Our agents
will recruit Greek interpreters,

15:59.166 --> 16:01.250
buy up a sizable cache of drachma,

16:01.333 --> 16:04.000
all to take the focus off Sicily,

16:04.083 --> 16:08.333
the real target and the site
of the actual invasion that same day.

16:08.416 --> 16:10.041
And the centerpiece of this deception?

16:10.125 --> 16:13.666
As I just said, Commander,
Twelfth Army is the centerpiece.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.416
It's not enough, I'm afraid.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.583
The tactics you've just outlined would

16:19.083 --> 16:23.416
point to Greece, but if we had
to get Hitler to divert actual troops

16:23.500 --> 16:25.583
from Sicily,
given her strategic importance,

16:25.666 --> 16:29.458
we would need to provide him with proof
of our intention towards Greece.

16:30.416 --> 16:32.458
-Fake proof, of course.
-I agree with that.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.375
And to that end, um,

16:34.458 --> 16:36.875
I've also been working on
a deception plan,

16:36.958 --> 16:38.666
which I've dubbed Operation Trojan Horse.

16:38.750 --> 16:41.000
It's a-- it's a ruse taken
from the Trout Memo.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.416
Idea number 28.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.375
Number 28? A corpse carrying false papers

16:44.458 --> 16:46.750
drops on the coast
from a parachute that supposedly failed.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.000
The Trout Memo is dead.

16:48.083 --> 16:50.833
I believe the prime minister
has an aversion to fish, Admiral.

16:50.916 --> 16:52.750
He did not kill the entire memo.

16:52.833 --> 16:55.541
A corpse carrying fake documents, hmm?

16:56.625 --> 17:00.333
Of all the ideas in the Trout Memo,
that one is by far the most precarious.

17:00.416 --> 17:03.000
Except the Germans will be
skittish on account of Spain,

17:03.083 --> 17:05.208
where they recently
failed to follow up real papers

17:05.291 --> 17:07.125
on the body of an airman
washed up in Cadiz.

17:07.208 --> 17:09.875
So may I suggest the timing is perfect.

17:09.958 --> 17:11.750
-For Trojan Horse?
-Mm.

17:12.208 --> 17:13.791
A code name a child could decipher.

17:14.375 --> 17:18.416
And the Germans would be expecting us to
plant papers precisely because of Cadiz.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.416
Or the Nazis being linear thinkers

17:20.500 --> 17:22.541
would not want to
make the same mistake twice.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.625
Simply a version of the Haversack Ruse.

17:24.708 --> 17:26.166
Of which, of course, I am well aware.

17:26.250 --> 17:29.083
Then you will also be aware
that the ruse has a good track record,

17:29.166 --> 17:31.250
which is what I believe my friend…

17:31.333 --> 17:34.333
Uh, Flight Lieutenant Cholmondeley.
C-H-O-L-M-O-N-D-E-L-E-Y.

17:34.416 --> 17:35.500
…was trying to say.

17:35.583 --> 17:37.958
For those of you who don't know
Lt. Commander Montagu,

17:38.041 --> 17:39.458
he joins us from the Old Bailey,

17:39.541 --> 17:41.458
which means he's had
little time for deception.

17:41.541 --> 17:42.958
I've spent my days in court, sir.

17:43.041 --> 17:45.458
Hence, he is blind to the obvious pitfalls

17:45.541 --> 17:48.458
of tossing a letter-laden corpse
into the sea.

17:48.541 --> 17:52.916
I'm simply saying that for a deception
to reach Hitler, it must have a channel.

17:53.500 --> 17:56.375
Spain is neutral,
the ideal place to launch such a plan

17:56.458 --> 17:58.750
because she is crawling with
spies from both sides.

17:58.833 --> 18:01.125
-She has a vast coastline.
-And since our agents

18:01.208 --> 18:02.958
in Madrid have
an elaborate network, we could

18:03.041 --> 18:05.375
quite literally float the documents
right into enemy hands.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.250
Montagu and Cholmondeley
are clearly convinced

18:08.333 --> 18:09.833
they have a direct line to the Fuhrer.

18:09.916 --> 18:14.208
So let's wish them both luck
implementing Operation Trojan Horse.

18:14.291 --> 18:17.458
The rest of us will proceed
with the operation I have outlined.

18:17.958 --> 18:19.708
I have a vested interest in this plot,

18:19.791 --> 18:22.791
which is why I've told M
in no uncertain terms

18:22.875 --> 18:26.208
you'll need a secure space,
command center, a staff…

18:26.291 --> 18:27.916
But do we think it can work?

18:28.416 --> 18:30.750
-I know I just made a case for it.
-An eloquent case.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.666
It's the Haversack Ruse.
It's tried, tested.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.708
"Deception needs a channel."
Those were your words.

18:35.791 --> 18:37.791
They were. I'm only imagining

18:38.625 --> 18:39.916
a dead body

18:40.416 --> 18:42.208
hurtling through the air.

18:42.708 --> 18:45.166
The plan is bold, there's no question,

18:45.250 --> 18:48.166
but it's ours now, regardless.
M's seen to that.

18:48.666 --> 18:52.125
Although, what if the body
does disintegrate on impact?

18:52.208 --> 18:54.500
Let's not bring that up now,
shall we?

18:54.583 --> 18:56.333
And definitely not in front of M.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.625
Why do you call Godfrey "M"?

18:58.708 --> 19:00.833
Because I called my mother "M."

19:00.916 --> 19:05.250
Most terrifying, most impossible,
most demanding creature I've ever known.

19:05.333 --> 19:08.291
What if the plane with the body
is intercepted before he's dropped?

19:08.375 --> 19:09.916
So, Mother has no faith in this?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.541
That's because Number 28
wasn't Godfrey's idea.

19:12.625 --> 19:16.041
It was mine, a plot I cribbed
from Basil Thompson's novel

19:16.125 --> 19:17.166
The Milliner's Hat.

19:17.250 --> 19:18.833
-Have you read Thompson?
-I prefer Buchan.

19:18.916 --> 19:21.666
Or what if the autopsy reveals
that he didn't die of drowning?

19:22.250 --> 19:25.833
Or if the briefcase is returned to us
without the Germans seeing its contents?

19:25.916 --> 19:28.666
Charles, why on earth
do you keep poking holes in our plan?

19:28.750 --> 19:30.041
I'm preemptively poking

19:30.125 --> 19:32.375
to ensure all the details
are properly thought through.

19:32.875 --> 19:34.083
Because as Godfrey made clear,

19:34.166 --> 19:35.958
our feet will be
held to the fire soon enough.

19:36.041 --> 19:38.250
The plan will work if we make it work.

19:40.750 --> 19:42.333
He's put you down here.

19:44.916 --> 19:47.458
I will certainly
be removed from prying eyes.

19:47.541 --> 19:50.250
Removed from
life in all forms, even the air.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.125
Will you be joining us down here, Fleming?

19:53.208 --> 19:55.708
I will likely stay upstairs.

19:55.791 --> 19:59.791
But whomever is equally industrious
will succeed equally well.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.500
-The Milliner's Hat, no doubt.
-Ah.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.291
Oh well, The Twenty Committee certainly

20:07.375 --> 20:10.083
has its advantages,
I suppose, if you like spooks.

20:10.916 --> 20:13.666
My friends think I'm
working in naval supplies.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.583
My mother believes I'm a clerk.

20:16.750 --> 20:18.208
And Robert Cholmondeley?

20:18.791 --> 20:19.750
My brother.

20:19.833 --> 20:21.958
I did hear the news from Chittagong.

20:22.541 --> 20:23.791
My deepest condolences.

20:23.875 --> 20:25.708
No, yes, we've lost a real hero.

20:26.666 --> 20:28.875
Leaving my mother with me, the penguin,

20:29.541 --> 20:32.375
RAF pilot and officer
with big feet and bad eyes,

20:32.875 --> 20:35.000
which means I'm, in effect, grounded,

20:35.750 --> 20:37.208
flightless bird.

20:40.083 --> 20:41.708
Well, what say we start with

20:41.791 --> 20:44.416
the easy part and find ourselves a corpse?

20:45.416 --> 20:47.333
You can take your pick, to be honest.

20:47.416 --> 20:49.625
That goes right down the corridor.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.541
Right, you can go straight through there.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.583
Two, three, lift.

21:02.875 --> 21:04.041
You did say drownings.

21:07.916 --> 21:08.875
Room 13.

21:09.375 --> 21:10.750
Coroner Birtwistle for you.

21:11.416 --> 21:12.458
Montagu.

21:13.666 --> 21:15.541
This is the same
Official Secrets Act

21:15.625 --> 21:17.041
you signed for Bletchley,

21:17.125 --> 21:19.625
but this covers your work
with The Twenty Committee

21:19.708 --> 21:21.375
and here in room 13.

21:21.458 --> 21:24.625
Male, of service age, drowned.

21:25.125 --> 21:27.958
-Now, tell me why you want him?
-Where are his legs?

21:28.625 --> 21:30.375
And are there 20 in The Twenty Committee?

21:30.458 --> 21:32.375
No, twenty's a joke. Two Xs.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.166
Ah, the Roman numerals.

21:34.250 --> 21:37.083
-Oh, as in double-cross?

21:38.041 --> 21:41.875
You will use your Bletchley skills
to fish for cues in decoded chatter

21:41.958 --> 21:45.125
about Sicily, Greece,
enemy troops in those areas.

21:45.208 --> 21:46.416
Is that understood?

21:48.250 --> 21:52.375
The team in 102 are planning
fake training exercises.

21:52.458 --> 21:54.833
106 are running double agents.

21:54.916 --> 21:57.625
107 will be dropping leaflets on Cypress.

21:57.708 --> 21:59.375
I don't know yet
what the leaflets will say.

21:59.458 --> 22:03.125
And yet here we are in a huge city
in the middle of a world war,

22:03.625 --> 22:06.958
and we can't seem to find ourselves
a single suitable corpse.

22:07.541 --> 22:08.958
We need an insider.

22:10.041 --> 22:11.541
We need Bentley Purchase.

22:12.041 --> 22:14.375
And to what purpose would the body be put?

22:14.458 --> 22:17.375
A warlike operation,
that's really all we can say.

22:17.458 --> 22:20.041
Although we can also say
that the body must be male,

22:20.125 --> 22:22.166
of service age, intact,

22:22.250 --> 22:23.875
and could pass for a drowning.

22:24.375 --> 22:27.333
Intriguing, but I'll have to demur.

22:27.416 --> 22:28.666
Public confidence in our office

22:28.750 --> 22:31.291
would be irreparably shaken
if something like that got out.

22:31.375 --> 22:32.708
Like the Darby case?

22:34.083 --> 22:35.583
You remember the Darby case, Bentley?

22:36.083 --> 22:38.083
I brought you in
to give the evidence a second look.

22:38.166 --> 22:39.750
Your testimony won the case.

22:39.833 --> 22:41.166
Case cemented your reputation,

22:41.875 --> 22:44.375
which led to your position here,
if I'm not mistaken.

22:44.875 --> 22:46.250
In a nutshell.

22:46.333 --> 22:47.583
The matter here is urgent.

22:47.666 --> 22:50.500
It is top secret,
and it is approved at the highest level.

22:50.583 --> 22:53.458
-It cannot be high enough.
-Churchill has approved it.

23:11.083 --> 23:12.541
Fresh as a daisy.

23:13.041 --> 23:15.791
Transferred from
Saint Pancras hospital yesterday.

23:15.875 --> 23:17.125
What is your name, dear?

23:17.916 --> 23:18.875
This is…

23:19.375 --> 23:20.458
was…

23:20.958 --> 23:22.375
Glyndwr Michael.

23:22.958 --> 23:24.958
What is it
you do for work, Glyndwr?

23:26.333 --> 23:28.833
There is no occupation
noted in the man's chart.

23:28.916 --> 23:31.541
Appears he was originally
from Aberbargoed,

23:32.041 --> 23:34.541
but in London, he was a vagrant,
no fixed address.

23:35.666 --> 23:38.583
Cause of death is chemical toxicity

23:39.083 --> 23:41.000
from rat poison left on bread.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.625
I want you to know,
God forgives you, Glyndwr,

23:46.125 --> 23:48.916
for hating yourself so much
you'd take your own life.

23:49.416 --> 23:52.416
It appears the man
ended his life while of unsound mind.

23:52.500 --> 23:56.125
Luckily for us, the human body
contains a host of chemicals naturally,

23:56.208 --> 23:59.000
so determining how he died
should he be immersed in water

23:59.083 --> 24:01.208
would require a highly skilled coroner.

24:02.083 --> 24:03.666
Where would you be landing him?

24:04.166 --> 24:06.208
Most likely a small coastal town.

24:06.291 --> 24:08.625
Where the local coroner,
if there's one at all,

24:08.708 --> 24:11.541
won't have the foggiest idea
why this chap kicked the bucket.

24:11.625 --> 24:13.833
Do you have any relatives, Glyndwr?

24:16.250 --> 24:18.000
Do you have a next of kin?

24:21.333 --> 24:23.125
The body is unclaimed,

24:23.791 --> 24:27.958
but I must warn you,
our friend will soon start to rot.

24:28.458 --> 24:30.000
I can place him in our coldest box,

24:30.083 --> 24:32.375
which will retard decomposition
but not arrest it.

24:32.458 --> 24:34.458
Meaning if Glyndwr Michael

24:34.541 --> 24:36.833
is to be of any use to you at all,

24:37.375 --> 24:39.583
he must be in service within three months.

24:48.041 --> 24:49.458
In the real war,

24:49.958 --> 24:53.625
there are constant reminders
of the brutality at hand.

24:56.750 --> 24:59.583
A quarter of a million lie dead in battle,

25:00.416 --> 25:01.875
an unspeakable horror

25:02.458 --> 25:04.500
with no end in sight.

25:05.041 --> 25:06.500
I'll be at my club.

25:07.125 --> 25:09.083
And I shall be up to no good

25:09.750 --> 25:10.958
as usual.

25:11.041 --> 25:12.875
While in the other war,

25:12.958 --> 25:14.500
the war of shadows

25:15.000 --> 25:17.541
normal life appears to continue,

25:18.208 --> 25:20.666
itself an act of canny deception.

25:22.166 --> 25:24.583


25:24.666 --> 25:26.708


25:26.791 --> 25:30.041


25:30.125 --> 25:31.333
In this war,

25:31.833 --> 25:33.916
real lives are also lost,

25:34.708 --> 25:38.500
and even fictional lives
can meet an untimely end.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.000
I believe my guests
have preceded me, Teddy.

25:45.083 --> 25:46.375
They have, sir,

25:46.458 --> 25:48.083
and ordered their drinks.

25:48.166 --> 25:49.083
Thank you.

25:50.625 --> 25:52.708
And once in a great while,

25:52.791 --> 25:56.125
the laws of nature
reverse themselves entirely,

25:56.916 --> 25:59.500
and the dead are made alive again.

25:59.583 --> 26:01.500
We were just discussing our chap.

26:01.583 --> 26:03.833
The crucial thing is that he must be real.

26:04.750 --> 26:05.958
As real as you or I.

26:07.041 --> 26:09.166
He must have parents, for example.

26:09.250 --> 26:11.833
Rank, regiment,
bank accounts, love affairs…

26:11.916 --> 26:14.041
Nicotine habit. He attended Oundle.

26:14.625 --> 26:16.208
Flew kites as a boy.

26:16.291 --> 26:19.041
And on a blustery day, you'll still
find him kiting in Dulwich Park.

26:19.125 --> 26:21.916
Thing is, the Germans will
scrutinize every detail of our fallen man.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.750
-So the slightest inconsistency--
-Ah, Teddy. Thank you.

26:26.458 --> 26:27.708
-Martini.
-Thank you.

26:27.791 --> 26:30.000
-Gin and lemon for the lady.
-Thank you.

26:31.791 --> 26:34.916
Even the, uh, slightest inconsistency
will signal the ruse.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.291
So, to create a real fake man
from a real dead man,

26:38.791 --> 26:39.625
we start by--

26:39.708 --> 26:42.000
By giving him a real, real name.

26:42.083 --> 26:45.208
-John would be solid.
-James. George. Robert is good.

26:45.291 --> 26:48.333
-That's my brother's name.
-Of course, forgive me.

26:48.416 --> 26:50.291
-But William could work.
-It could.

26:50.875 --> 26:53.625
And William would be a Royal Marine.

26:53.708 --> 26:56.250
An officer in the Royal Marines
if he's carrying secret letters.

26:56.333 --> 26:57.166
Exactly right.

26:57.250 --> 26:59.458
An officer in the Royal Marines

26:59.958 --> 27:01.000
with a common British name,

27:01.083 --> 27:02.916
so that when
the Germans check the Navy lists,

27:03.000 --> 27:07.416
it will be harder to
track down a Major William Martin.

27:07.500 --> 27:10.625
With your identification number.
How very clever.

27:10.708 --> 27:12.625
So, if the Germans do follow the name--

27:12.708 --> 27:14.708
Ewen will be the first to know.

27:15.291 --> 27:19.333
There it is, as if I… were him.

27:19.416 --> 27:22.583
-Now, all we need is his photograph.
-In Royal Marine Blues.

27:22.666 --> 27:25.958
No, no. Marines travel in battledress,
and our Marine will be traveling.

27:26.041 --> 27:28.041
And the uniform cannot appear new.

27:28.125 --> 27:29.875
It must be broken down.

27:29.958 --> 27:32.583
It must have exactly
the right patina of wear,

27:33.125 --> 27:34.125
as if I were him.

27:34.625 --> 27:38.458
There must be a love story
if Maj. Martin's life is to be believable.

27:38.541 --> 27:41.041
Objection.
Creation of a material fact.

27:41.125 --> 27:43.416
A real life need not be a romantic one.

27:43.500 --> 27:46.416
He would carry a letter from his betrothed
professing her deep love for him.

27:46.500 --> 27:49.166
That's very good. That's precisely
the level of detail we need.

27:49.666 --> 27:51.208
-And he would carry her photograph.
-Yes.

27:51.291 --> 27:53.541
Well, we clearly read different novels.

27:53.625 --> 27:56.500
Well, why not ask
some of our female colleagues

27:56.583 --> 27:58.500
if they might be willing
to submit snapshots,

27:58.583 --> 28:00.875
and perhaps we can
find a partner for our Major Martin.

28:00.958 --> 28:02.333
That's not a risk?

28:02.416 --> 28:04.458
Picking a girl working in the Admiralty?

28:04.541 --> 28:07.041
She's an anonymous girl,
washed up on a distant shore.

28:07.125 --> 28:08.458
Oh, she might even be thrilled

28:08.541 --> 28:10.833
to find herself
in the middle of a dangerous plot.

28:11.333 --> 28:13.166
Lives at stake, countries at war.

28:13.916 --> 28:16.125
Her lover torn away by duty and fate.

28:19.416 --> 28:21.500
You want me to help you?

28:21.583 --> 28:23.458
And by extension,
help your country.

28:24.166 --> 28:26.416
Yes, you know all the girls
in the office and, um,

28:26.916 --> 28:31.041
I've seen the way you go about your work.
You're very clever and,

28:32.000 --> 28:33.291
uh, meticulous and--

28:33.375 --> 28:34.583
You've been watching me.

28:34.666 --> 28:38.125
No, no, not-- there's certainly--
there's nothing untoward, I simply…

28:40.375 --> 28:44.208
If you could point me to a girl
who would give us her photograph.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.208
But what would her photograph be used for?

28:48.291 --> 28:50.250
Well, I'm afraid that's classified.

28:50.750 --> 28:54.458
But, um, by donating her image,
she'd be involved in

28:54.541 --> 28:57.583
and on the ground floor
of a significant operation.

28:57.666 --> 28:59.458
Operation Trojan Horse.

28:59.541 --> 29:00.625
It's been renamed,

29:01.125 --> 29:02.500
something less obvious.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.375
Operation Mincemeat.

29:04.458 --> 29:06.166
Due to the dead body.

29:06.250 --> 29:09.291
-You surmised that rather quickly.
-I already knew the plot.

29:13.250 --> 29:15.083
Would something like this do?

29:18.833 --> 29:20.958
Taken by my husband a long time ago.

29:22.708 --> 29:23.541
Your husband,

29:24.333 --> 29:25.708
I didn't realize, um…

29:26.583 --> 29:28.041
Well, it-- it's

29:28.125 --> 29:30.291
lovely. It's-- it's perfect.

29:30.375 --> 29:32.500
It could be my
contribution to the mission.

29:33.125 --> 29:34.500
First of many, perhaps.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.791
My photograph in exchange
for a seat at the table.

29:42.333 --> 29:43.333
Very well.

29:47.458 --> 29:48.666
I'm all ears.

29:49.791 --> 29:52.375
Well, we've managed to find a body.

29:53.333 --> 29:54.375
Pretty as a picture.

29:55.250 --> 29:57.166
And the process
of transforming him into

29:57.250 --> 30:00.000
Major William Martin is on the way.

30:04.958 --> 30:05.833
Bloody hell!

30:06.416 --> 30:09.958
Let's just not attempt
to make him smile again, please.

30:10.458 --> 30:12.791
-Does none of us any favors.
-Because he looks dead, Bentley.

30:12.875 --> 30:14.875
Whatever we do, just deader and deader.

30:14.958 --> 30:17.875
It's hard to come alive
for one's close up in this state.

30:17.958 --> 30:19.625
If we bungle one tiny detail,

30:19.708 --> 30:22.458
a droopy eyelid,
an open mouth instead of a smile,

30:22.541 --> 30:25.500
we might as well telegraph
Berlin ourselves it's all a hoax.

30:25.583 --> 30:27.750
Then may I suggest a live face?

30:27.833 --> 30:29.583
That looks just like the dead face?

30:29.666 --> 30:31.041
In a city of nine million,

30:31.791 --> 30:33.583
surely someone resembles our friend.

30:47.625 --> 30:49.583
Do we think he'd be dancing?

30:49.666 --> 30:51.083
Major Martin, if he were here?

30:51.166 --> 30:52.083
Well, he is an officer.

30:52.166 --> 30:55.416
Well, not all officers dance, and I doubt
our Bill gives two figs for dancing.

30:57.958 --> 30:59.583
No, too full in the face.

30:59.666 --> 31:02.041
-But without the mustache?
-His brow is too heavy.

31:02.666 --> 31:04.000
Why don't we try something easier,

31:04.083 --> 31:06.125
for God's sake,
like looking for tits on a bull?

31:06.875 --> 31:08.291
Forgive me. That was uncalled for.

31:08.375 --> 31:11.375
No, I saw the photographs.
It's called for.

31:11.875 --> 31:14.750
As for dancing, I suspect
the major's not much for a foxtrot

31:14.833 --> 31:17.125
but could clear the floor with a tango.

31:17.208 --> 31:20.625
Our progress to date:
Major Bill Martin is an industrious chap,

31:20.708 --> 31:24.250
occasionally forgetful,
habitually tardy, but also clever.

31:24.333 --> 31:26.291
-Amend that to brilliant.
-He's no good with money.

31:26.375 --> 31:28.458
We should include
an overdraft letter in his briefcase.

31:28.541 --> 31:30.583
And is he happy? Is he a happy man?

31:30.666 --> 31:31.708
He wants to be.

31:32.208 --> 31:34.208
He started out with such promise,

31:34.791 --> 31:37.916
a sense of hope about,
about the world, about his future.

31:39.541 --> 31:42.250
But now it all seems dark, uncertain.

31:42.916 --> 31:44.458
He is in the middle of a war.

31:44.541 --> 31:46.625
Exactly right.
He signed up for the Royal Marines.

31:46.708 --> 31:49.833
But once commissioned was consigned
to a desk, which he despised.

31:49.916 --> 31:53.333
Because the life he really wanted
was one of daring and intrigue,

31:53.416 --> 31:57.125
and so he escaped,
and he switched to the commandos,

31:57.208 --> 31:59.208
where he distinguished
himself in technical matters.

31:59.291 --> 32:00.875
The mechanics of landing craft.

32:00.958 --> 32:03.125
And he predicted
the Dieppe Raid would be a catastrophe.

32:03.208 --> 32:04.291
And how right he was.

32:04.375 --> 32:06.750
He sounds like a character
from Sir John's latest novel.

32:07.333 --> 32:10.041
-Masterman is writing a novel?
-A spy novel.

32:10.125 --> 32:12.333
Apparently, he thinks of me as his muse.

32:12.416 --> 32:15.500
Well then, he may be in for a duel
because you're Major Martin's muse now.

32:15.583 --> 32:18.000
The girl I was at 20 is his muse.

32:18.083 --> 32:20.666
Nevertheless, it's your photograph
that will be pressed to his heart

32:20.750 --> 32:21.625
when he washes ashore.

32:21.708 --> 32:23.791
Yes, wallet litter
is what you are.

32:24.916 --> 32:26.291
Not as in rubbish.

32:26.375 --> 32:28.291
That's just spy parlance
for the bits and pieces

32:28.375 --> 32:30.000
that one finds in one's pockets.

32:30.083 --> 32:31.458
And do I have a name?

32:31.541 --> 32:32.458
Pam.

32:34.125 --> 32:37.458
Not five weeks ago,
the major looked across a crowded room.

32:37.541 --> 32:39.250
Across a crowded room.

32:39.333 --> 32:40.541
The major sat

32:41.125 --> 32:43.500
at a small table in a strange bar

32:44.041 --> 32:46.041
and found himself with a woman

32:46.708 --> 32:49.208
both known and unknown to him all at once.

32:50.916 --> 32:52.750
Within days, something deep

32:53.750 --> 32:57.166
and unexpected had blossomed,
culminating in a diamond ring

32:57.250 --> 32:59.291
slid onto Pam's slim finger

33:00.250 --> 33:03.458
as Bill revealed himself to her
as a changed man.

33:03.958 --> 33:05.125
Jean?

33:06.750 --> 33:07.625
Jean.

33:08.791 --> 33:09.833
There you are.

33:09.916 --> 33:11.458
I had him down as a guest.

33:11.541 --> 33:15.083
Yes, under Lieutenant Commander
Montagu's name. Thank you.

33:16.916 --> 33:19.083
-Please, sit.
-Thanks.

33:19.166 --> 33:22.208
I suppose it's very fashionable
these days marrying an American.

33:22.708 --> 33:25.250
Who, me? Oh no, that'd be my lucky day.

33:25.750 --> 33:27.583
Jean and I only just met, but, uh,

33:27.666 --> 33:31.375
well, so far she tolerates me well enough,
so I guess there's hope.

33:31.875 --> 33:33.041
I'm a widow.

33:33.708 --> 33:37.541
So, this is my friend
Sergeant Roger Dearborn.

33:37.625 --> 33:39.000
It's nice to meet you all.

33:40.541 --> 33:42.416
Jean said you wanted to talk to me?

33:45.083 --> 33:47.208
Or you didn't want to talk to me.

33:47.291 --> 33:51.541
Uh, no, we did, because we were
discussing something, top-secret project.

33:51.625 --> 33:52.666
A study.

33:53.458 --> 33:54.625
Profiling…

33:55.750 --> 33:57.750
American servicemen and how they might…

33:57.833 --> 33:59.666
…integrate
with British troops.

34:00.625 --> 34:01.500
That's top-secret?

34:01.583 --> 34:03.791
The Nazis wreaked havoc
with the radio antenna.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.458
Well, I'm not sure what that has to do--

34:05.541 --> 34:09.041
What, what we're wondering is whether you
would care to participate in the project?

34:09.125 --> 34:11.041
It wouldn't take much time.
Just a few questions.

34:11.125 --> 34:12.583
Allow us to take your photograph.

34:12.666 --> 34:15.125
We could arrange for you
to come around to the Admiralty,

34:15.208 --> 34:16.250
say tomorrow.

34:17.750 --> 34:19.666
Go on. It'll be fun.

34:21.875 --> 34:23.791
-Okay, then.
-Very nice to meet you.

34:23.875 --> 34:25.250
-Thanks.
-So, I'll see you tomorrow.

34:25.333 --> 34:26.333
Hopefully, see you soon.

34:26.916 --> 34:28.916
What do you think? Well, he could do?

34:29.000 --> 34:32.208
-I know he's not a perfect match, but--
-A gift horse. He will do.

34:32.708 --> 34:33.791
A toast.

34:33.875 --> 34:36.083
To Pam, our secret weapon

34:36.166 --> 34:38.625
who's already managed
to see what we could not.

34:40.833 --> 34:44.208
No, I think it was after university
that Bill took up the bass…

34:44.291 --> 34:45.583
I think it was trumpet.

34:45.666 --> 34:48.416
…which was frowned upon
by his mother, Antonia,

34:48.500 --> 34:52.541
a devout Catholic who at all times
kept a candle lit for Saint Jude.

34:52.625 --> 34:55.375
Every piece makes a whole.
A man is a mosaic.

34:57.166 --> 34:59.875
Will you wake your family
getting home so late?

35:00.833 --> 35:03.166
My wife is in America with the children.

35:03.666 --> 35:05.333
Hester told me just this morning

35:05.416 --> 35:08.625
she'd taken a job there,
with the British Security Coordination.

35:08.708 --> 35:10.250
Hester told you?

35:11.375 --> 35:15.083
May I just say I was
very sorry to hear of your husband.

35:15.750 --> 35:17.916
I've been alone for many years,

35:18.000 --> 35:21.958
which is why it pleases me
to see Bill and Pam so madly in love.

35:22.041 --> 35:24.750
Pam is very lucky
to have you cheering her on.

35:25.500 --> 35:26.583
And Bill, you.

35:29.541 --> 35:31.041
Thank you for walking with me.

35:31.125 --> 35:32.916
I can see you all the way up.

35:33.958 --> 35:36.208
Actually, I think I'll stay.

35:36.291 --> 35:37.541
What, in there?

35:37.625 --> 35:38.458
Alone?

35:39.250 --> 35:40.458
No, I couldn't possibly.

35:40.958 --> 35:43.708
I'm perfectly capable
of taking care of myself.

35:43.791 --> 35:45.250
Who would argue otherwise?

35:47.916 --> 35:50.083
It's Bill and Pam's favorite song.

36:37.291 --> 36:38.541
Whoo!

36:41.041 --> 36:43.083
It was more like a lethal Lindy Hop.

36:43.166 --> 36:46.166
You flattened every male
of fighting age in the place.

36:46.666 --> 36:48.208
I was testing it out.

36:48.291 --> 36:50.708
Oh, a secret weapon against the Nazis.

36:51.291 --> 36:52.875
Pam's secret weapon.

36:53.375 --> 36:55.416
Her way of forgetting her woes.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.791
Major Martin will need
the stamina of an ox.

37:00.458 --> 37:03.208
She's a surprising woman though,
isn't she? Pam?

37:04.208 --> 37:06.458
At a crossroads in her life, still young.

37:07.125 --> 37:10.166
Probably, hasn't quite found her stride.

37:10.666 --> 37:12.500
Is she younger than Bill?

37:12.583 --> 37:14.625
I hadn't pictured them that way.

37:14.708 --> 37:16.291
Well, Bill's hardly old.

37:17.666 --> 37:19.041
If you say so.

37:20.416 --> 37:24.666
What I think Pam sees in Bill
beyond the dashing figure he cuts

37:24.750 --> 37:26.416
when he walks into a room,

37:26.916 --> 37:28.250
is something deeper.

37:28.791 --> 37:30.791
And Bill suspects the same in her.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.791
But at first, all he sees
is a woman of fierce intelligence,

37:34.875 --> 37:37.541
uncommon grace,
a demon on the dance floor.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.250
A woman ready to take wing.

37:41.750 --> 37:43.791
I think she's already on her way.

37:44.791 --> 37:46.041
A happy story.

37:46.125 --> 37:48.333
Except that he's off to war.

37:48.833 --> 37:50.458
Which is tomorrow's work.

37:51.041 --> 37:52.500
And I'll need your help.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.666
I'll wait here till you're in.

37:57.750 --> 37:59.666
I'll be fine. Thank you.

38:02.583 --> 38:03.500
Goodnight.

38:12.875 --> 38:14.458
Writing sample number five,

38:14.541 --> 38:17.166
standard blue-black,
in leather wallet, in pocket

38:17.250 --> 38:18.916
soaked overnight in seawater.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.166
Seawater from?

38:21.666 --> 38:22.875
It does matter, Hester.

38:22.958 --> 38:25.625
Disposal shut down the road
in all directions.

38:26.083 --> 38:28.708
A child found
an unexploded firebomb in her garden.

38:28.791 --> 38:30.125
Oh, dear God.

38:30.625 --> 38:32.000
No word from Bletchley?

38:32.083 --> 38:35.750
Nazi command still expects us
to launch a naval assault on Europe.

38:35.833 --> 38:38.541
They suspect a massive deception
operation is underway.

38:39.041 --> 38:41.875
They still believe Sicily
will be the target.

38:42.458 --> 38:45.083
So, two months of work
and we've managed to deceive the enemy

38:45.166 --> 38:46.958
of precisely nothing.

38:47.041 --> 38:50.916
The one bright spot is I found
a hydrographer. I'm meeting him now.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.083
Well, I hope it's not
Hespers from Naval Operations.

38:53.166 --> 38:55.333
The man is an incorrigible skirt chaser.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.791
My skirt can defend itself,

38:56.875 --> 38:59.250
but I could use your expertise, Commander.

38:59.333 --> 39:00.791
-Very well.

39:05.208 --> 39:06.083
Room 13.

39:06.166 --> 39:07.416
That is his rank,

39:08.750 --> 39:10.125
Lieutenant Commander.

39:10.208 --> 39:14.291
Of course. They were just less… formal
when I saw them a few weeks ago

39:14.958 --> 39:16.208
dancing at Rainbow Corner.

39:16.291 --> 39:19.666
-I saw them a few rows back…
-Lieutenant, Admiral Godfrey.

39:19.750 --> 39:22.416
Joseph Cotton plays
an American engineer hiding in Anatolia.

39:24.041 --> 39:27.041
-Admiral.
-So, where are we with Mincemeat?

39:27.125 --> 39:29.000
We're on a solid footing, sir.

39:29.625 --> 39:31.458
Yes, Major Martin is as real as you or I.

39:31.541 --> 39:33.166
He has hobbies,

39:33.250 --> 39:35.666
debts, a girl. They're-- They're to marry.
We have a ring, ha.

39:35.750 --> 39:36.583
Touching.

39:36.666 --> 39:39.041
We believe Major Martin
should be delivered by submarine

39:39.125 --> 39:41.250
rather than air-dropping
and risk dismemberment.

39:41.333 --> 39:44.375
And we are convinced that Spain is
still the best place to float him ashore,

39:44.875 --> 39:47.541
given the fascists' network there
and Spain's neutrality.

39:48.041 --> 39:51.041
And we believe
the plan is ready to present, sir,

39:51.125 --> 39:52.458
to the prime minister.

39:52.958 --> 39:53.958
I agree.

39:55.875 --> 39:56.708
You--

39:58.041 --> 39:59.958
Well, that's, uh, that's excellent news.

40:00.041 --> 40:02.083
I'll present it to
Churchill this afternoon.

40:02.875 --> 40:05.125
-I'll need a brief.
-Well, we've prepared one for you, sir.

40:05.208 --> 40:06.333
You'll be more than ready.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.125
And your partnership with Montagu. Please.

40:11.625 --> 40:12.958
How has that fared?

40:15.291 --> 40:16.958
Nothing short of first-rate, sir.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.416
Montagu and I think with one mind. We, um,

40:21.916 --> 40:23.416
we've developed a shorthand.

40:23.916 --> 40:25.250
Become good friends.

40:25.333 --> 40:27.458
Huh, So you've
met his brother, then? Ivor.

40:27.541 --> 40:29.625
No, no. Montagu rarely speaks of him.

40:31.041 --> 40:33.708
Are you aware
he's a Communist sympathizer?

40:36.250 --> 40:39.166
Montagu's brother? That's absurd.

40:39.250 --> 40:41.458
Our intelligence
suggests otherwise.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.583
Why would our intelligence
be watching Ivor Montagu?

40:49.625 --> 40:53.500
Whatever Ivor may or may not be,

40:54.916 --> 40:56.291
his brother would be unaware of it.

40:58.166 --> 41:01.041
It's always sound policy
to keep one's ear to the ground,

41:01.125 --> 41:02.125
don't you think?

41:06.250 --> 41:07.166
Thank you.

41:09.458 --> 41:12.041
I shall look forward to good news
from the prime minister, sir.

41:15.083 --> 41:18.625
I only mention it because Charles
asked me out to dinner tonight.

41:18.708 --> 41:20.416
Did you invite him to join us?

41:20.500 --> 41:22.208
I didn't say I was going with you.

41:22.291 --> 41:24.333
I sense he'd be upset somehow.

41:24.416 --> 41:26.833
That's silly.
The man's not a child.

41:26.916 --> 41:28.666
Oh, I almost forgot.

41:30.625 --> 41:31.583
What do you think?

41:32.250 --> 41:33.250
It's beautiful.

41:33.750 --> 41:35.708
Charles and I
ducked out at lunch yesterday.

41:35.791 --> 41:38.541
He preferred the round cut,
but I prevailed with the marquise.

41:39.333 --> 41:40.250
Let's see it on.

41:46.916 --> 41:49.500
The only place
this belongs is in the safe.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Admiralty property.

41:51.083 --> 41:52.416
Yes, of course.

41:53.416 --> 41:54.583
You think Pam will like it?

41:56.000 --> 41:57.083
I think she might.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.458
This should be in the safe.

42:11.458 --> 42:13.916
Yes, I was about to put it back.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.666
I wanted to show it to Jean.

42:16.708 --> 42:18.041
You gave it to Jean?

42:18.125 --> 42:19.875
I showed it to her.

42:20.458 --> 42:22.125
I wanted to see what she thought of it.

42:22.833 --> 42:24.583
If you're so concerned,
stow it away yourself.

42:24.666 --> 42:28.083
In matters of protocol,
it seems bad practice,

42:28.583 --> 42:31.791
sloppy even,
for us to be going off as separate pairs.

42:31.875 --> 42:33.208
Like you and Godfrey.

42:33.833 --> 42:35.708
He called you in alone just now,
didn't he?

42:35.791 --> 42:36.958
Why was that?

42:37.458 --> 42:38.833
Godfrey is only happy when he's

42:38.916 --> 42:40.958
stirring up suspicion and discord,
as you well know.

42:41.041 --> 42:42.958
-Room 13.

42:43.041 --> 42:44.333
Bentley Purchase for you.

42:45.916 --> 42:47.166
Yes, Bentley, what is it?

42:48.041 --> 42:49.833
We've had an unexpected visitor.

42:51.750 --> 42:54.333
Ms. Michael heard of
her brother's passing from

42:54.833 --> 42:56.083
Stafford Hospital.

42:56.708 --> 43:00.125
A kindly nurse who cared for him then
took it upon herself to find his kin.

43:01.166 --> 43:02.166
God bless her.

43:05.083 --> 43:09.375
-Please accept our deepest--
-We only had each other… you know?

43:11.541 --> 43:13.541
He needed looking after, Glynnie.

43:14.666 --> 43:17.000
But I let him go to London.

43:18.833 --> 43:19.750
And then I…

43:23.791 --> 43:24.875
Stamps,

43:26.291 --> 43:27.125
tickets,

43:28.625 --> 43:30.166
an unwrapped mint?

43:30.250 --> 43:33.125
-It's called wallet litter, sir.
-Yes, I know what it is.

43:33.208 --> 43:34.500
But it's the letters in the case

43:34.583 --> 43:36.291
that are key to this deception,
are they not?

43:36.375 --> 43:37.208
They are.

43:38.125 --> 43:39.375
Military correspondence

43:40.208 --> 43:42.375
indicating that we will invade Greece

43:43.041 --> 43:44.833
while hinting
that our cover plan is Sicily.

43:44.916 --> 43:45.750
Yes.

43:46.500 --> 43:48.458
The brief contains
details of the correspondence.

43:48.541 --> 43:51.708
What happens when the ink
washes off as the letter bobs in the sea?

43:52.541 --> 43:54.666
They need to use waterproof ink.

43:54.750 --> 43:57.583
Only someone planning to drown
writes in waterproof ink.

43:58.750 --> 43:59.583
Yes,

43:59.666 --> 44:00.791
that's true. But, uh--

44:00.875 --> 44:03.541
A detail your men clearly understand
as they state here that,

44:04.041 --> 44:07.875
"Further testing of undetectable
waterproof inks remains to be done."

44:10.208 --> 44:12.541
Yes, good boy.
Come on.

44:13.708 --> 44:16.250
Given how little you
appreciate of this plan, Admiral,

44:16.750 --> 44:18.916
Rufus and I wonder
why you're endorsing it at all.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.458
I am not endorsing it, Prime Minister.

44:22.416 --> 44:25.416
My advice is that Mincemeat is killed
before it sees the light of day.

44:26.458 --> 44:28.666
Our other deception plans are strategies

44:29.166 --> 44:31.500
designed to confuse the enemy,
throw him off balance.

44:31.583 --> 44:33.625
Mincemeat, on the other hand,
is an outright lie.

44:33.708 --> 44:37.375
A lie that, if detected, would expose
every single other deception as false.

44:37.458 --> 44:40.208
The Germans would know
unequivocally we were landing in Sicily.

44:40.291 --> 44:41.541
I think that's too big a risk.

44:42.333 --> 44:45.583
Nonetheless, I would like to
keep Mincemeat running a little longer.

44:46.083 --> 44:50.375
It may yield intelligence on Ivor Montagu,
whom we suspect is a Russian spy.

44:50.458 --> 44:54.750
You will put the fate of one Russian spy
over tens of thousands in Sicily?

44:54.833 --> 44:57.875
With respect, Prime Minister,
I'm trying to look at the bigger picture.

44:58.375 --> 45:00.375
Russia may be our ally at the moment,

45:00.458 --> 45:02.500
but she was until recently
in a pact with Germany.

45:03.083 --> 45:05.583
I believe she will soon
be our enemy again.

45:05.666 --> 45:08.083
If Ivor Montagu is spying for Moscow,

45:08.833 --> 45:12.125
he can be turned,
or if necessary, eliminated.

45:12.208 --> 45:14.791
This is the problem
when one is dealing with spooks.

45:15.375 --> 45:16.375
You do see it.

45:16.875 --> 45:18.583
The corkscrew thinking required

45:18.666 --> 45:21.875
to manage spies
sometimes twists one too many turns

45:22.625 --> 45:25.041
until one finds oneself charging forward

45:25.125 --> 45:27.583
while at the same time
looking out of one's own ass.

45:27.666 --> 45:30.375
I assume you're referring to me.

45:30.458 --> 45:32.125
Russia is tomorrow's war.

45:33.666 --> 45:35.666
The Nazis are expecting a deception,

45:36.458 --> 45:39.375
which means that our effort
must be unbelievable enough

45:39.458 --> 45:40.541
to make it believable.

45:40.625 --> 45:43.500
The plan is risky.
It's also highly implausible.

45:44.416 --> 45:46.208
Meaning that all the reasons
it shouldn't work

45:46.291 --> 45:48.833
are the same reasons
the Germans might believe it's true.

45:48.916 --> 45:50.250
So, when can it be ready?

45:50.333 --> 45:51.166
Uh…

45:52.041 --> 45:53.500
-Immediately?
-Correct.

45:54.041 --> 45:55.375
Gather your resources.

45:55.875 --> 45:58.083
Put Mincemeat in the works as of now.

45:58.583 --> 45:59.750
Of course, sir.

46:06.750 --> 46:08.750
Do you think we can get him buried soon?

46:09.916 --> 46:12.500
But-- Not that anyone's
waiting for me at home,

46:12.583 --> 46:14.750
but a simple service might be nice.

46:14.833 --> 46:17.291
The truth is Glyndwr is employed now.

46:19.500 --> 46:21.875
-Employed?
-In the service of his country.

46:23.916 --> 46:24.833
He's not dead?

46:24.916 --> 46:26.708
He is engaged in a

46:27.291 --> 46:28.875
top-secret mission.

46:28.958 --> 46:30.708
As what?

46:32.291 --> 46:34.416
You do know that Glynnie
was never right in the head.

46:34.500 --> 46:35.958
Well, that

46:36.708 --> 46:38.500
may be your experience of

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Glyndwr, but, um,

46:41.500 --> 46:42.916
people are often

46:43.541 --> 46:45.041
one way with family, a…

46:46.000 --> 46:47.916
different way entirely out in the world.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.041
One minute Jekyll, the next, Hyde.

46:50.541 --> 46:51.416
Where is he?

46:51.500 --> 46:53.208
We have Churchill's approval.

46:55.500 --> 46:57.083
As you just heard, Ms. Michael,

46:57.666 --> 47:00.500
the prime minister has approved
the plan to make your brother a hero.

47:01.333 --> 47:04.375
We, we do understand
that this is the most enormous sacrifice.

47:05.083 --> 47:07.916
But his service, he-- he can save

47:08.416 --> 47:10.750
literally thousands,
tens of thousands of lives.

47:10.833 --> 47:12.208
What did you do to him?

47:13.125 --> 47:15.625
Did you carve him up for experiments

47:16.125 --> 47:17.000
or rations?

47:17.500 --> 47:20.833
Maybe you should tell the police
about what you did to my brother.

47:20.916 --> 47:24.041
Ms. Michael,
in acknowledgment of his service

47:24.833 --> 47:28.791
and empowered by his Majesty's
government and by Glyndwr himself,

47:29.291 --> 47:31.333
it is my honor to offer you this

47:32.083 --> 47:33.541
generous remuneration.

47:34.583 --> 47:37.041
-You're bribing me.
-Your brother is going to war.

47:38.250 --> 47:40.291
He's trying to do
the right thing for his country.

47:40.375 --> 47:44.125
His country is trying to do
the right thing by you.

47:44.208 --> 47:45.458
Please.

47:48.916 --> 47:53.166
May Glynnie's poor
suffering soul rest in peace.

47:55.000 --> 47:55.875
No thanks to you.

48:01.291 --> 48:02.541
May God forgive us all.

48:05.291 --> 48:06.583
I miss Spain already.

48:06.666 --> 48:09.125
There's a reason we stay
as far from headquarters as possible.

48:09.208 --> 48:11.291
Yes, we envy you daily.

48:11.375 --> 48:13.125
I must congratulate you, if I may,

48:13.208 --> 48:15.416
Captain Ainsworth, on The Night Starling.

48:15.500 --> 48:17.291
I grabbed a copy at Hatchards yesterday.

48:17.375 --> 48:18.791
I have not been able to put it down.

48:18.875 --> 48:21.291
My God, who isn't writing a novel?

48:21.375 --> 48:26.458
Admiral, our naval attaché in Madrid,
Captain Ainsworth, is here today.

48:27.041 --> 48:30.333
And this is assistant naval attaché,
also from Madrid,

48:30.416 --> 48:31.708
Lieutenant Commander Gomez-Beare.

48:31.791 --> 48:33.125
Captain. Commander.

48:33.708 --> 48:35.541
Good to know
we can still reel you gentlemen in

48:35.625 --> 48:37.250
from our far-flung outposts.

48:37.333 --> 48:40.416
Montagu and Cholmondeley
will run the briefing today.

48:40.500 --> 48:44.208
The operation is theirs, and being theirs,
is now theirs to fuck up.

48:47.083 --> 48:48.791
Quite a vote of confidence.

48:50.333 --> 48:54.416
Our story begins
in the Spanish fishing port of Huelva

48:54.500 --> 48:55.833
on the Gulf of Cadiz,

48:55.916 --> 48:58.000
where Major William Martin,

48:58.083 --> 49:00.916
a British officer
bearing classified letters,

49:01.000 --> 49:05.333
will wash up on shore
after his plane has been tragically lost.

49:06.250 --> 49:09.041
The officer is not an officer.
The papers are false.

49:09.541 --> 49:11.750
The plane crash will not have occurred.

49:12.250 --> 49:15.500
Instead, we will release
our man from a submarine

49:16.291 --> 49:17.750
in order to exploit

49:17.833 --> 49:20.083
the Nazi spy trail,
which begins in Huelva,

49:20.166 --> 49:21.958
Don Gomez-Beare's territory,

49:22.041 --> 49:24.833
and then moves to Madrid,
Captain Ainsworth's turf,

49:24.916 --> 49:27.791
and ends in the heart
of German intelligence,

49:27.875 --> 49:29.750
the Abwehr in Berlin.

49:30.250 --> 49:33.416
We will need to move
these fake documents quickly

49:33.500 --> 49:36.125
with the help
of two key German operatives,

49:36.208 --> 49:38.500
Karl Kuhlenthal in Madrid

49:38.583 --> 49:41.791
and his right-hand man
in Huelva, Adolf Clauss.

49:41.875 --> 49:44.208
Clauss is an exceptional spy,

49:44.291 --> 49:46.625
and if a body
washes up in Huelva with papers,

49:46.708 --> 49:49.291
Adolf Clauss
will get his hands on those papers.

49:49.791 --> 49:53.500
Clauss reports
to Karl Kuhlenthal in Madrid,

49:53.583 --> 49:56.208
where Kuhlenthal is seen
as a golden boy by the Abwehr.

49:56.291 --> 50:00.916
But MI5 have found Kuhlenthal
to be a one-man espionage disaster.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.125
Gullible, incompetent,
and he happens to be one-quarter Jewish,

50:04.708 --> 50:08.375
where under Hitler's regime,
even a drop of Jewish blood means death.

50:10.041 --> 50:14.208
Although luckily for Kuhlenthal,
he was recently cleared as a good German.

50:14.708 --> 50:16.958
But he is now desperate
to impress his superiors

50:17.041 --> 50:20.041
before Berlin remembers
that he is Jewish after all.

50:20.125 --> 50:22.875
So, we need Clauss
because he is a good spy

50:22.958 --> 50:27.166
and will get the papers,
Kuhlenthal because he is a bad one

50:27.250 --> 50:28.833
and will believe them.

50:29.333 --> 50:32.666
Together, they ensure the best chance
that our documents will land in Berlin.

50:32.750 --> 50:35.458
Where success
depends on another key figure,

50:35.958 --> 50:40.375
Hitler's favorite adviser,
Colonel Alexis von Roenne.

50:41.125 --> 50:44.458
Von Roenne controls military
intelligence at Nazi High Command,

50:44.541 --> 50:47.500
and Hitler will not believe anything
without Von Roenne's blessing,

50:48.000 --> 50:51.375
which is a challenge for us
because Von Roenne is brilliant.

50:51.458 --> 50:52.750
A real spy's spy.

50:53.500 --> 50:56.750
-Though, there have been rumors…
-And at this point, only rumors.

50:56.833 --> 50:58.958
…that Von Roenne
has turned against the Fuhrer,

50:59.750 --> 51:02.458
and that he
and a group of anti-Nazi plotters

51:02.541 --> 51:05.250
are trying to destroy
the Nazi war machine from within.

51:05.750 --> 51:09.083
We've heard rumblings
of this anti-Hitler faction before.

51:09.708 --> 51:13.208
We judge it to be a ruse
to infiltrate our inner circle,

51:13.291 --> 51:14.875
so we will proceed as planned.

51:14.958 --> 51:18.583
The prime minister wants all resources
employed to make Mincemeat so convincing

51:18.666 --> 51:22.291
that Von Roenne believes it,
Hitler believes it, and even we believe

51:22.791 --> 51:24.500
we are landing in Greece.

51:24.583 --> 51:27.916
To that end, we are preparing
the fake documents for the briefcase now.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.375
The key one being an off-the-record letter
between Generals Nye and Alexander,

51:33.458 --> 51:37.166
and in that letter,
the lie about Greece is planted.

51:37.791 --> 51:40.458
Of course we'll get
our letter approved tomorrow,

51:40.541 --> 51:43.666
but you simply must sit on Q Branch

51:44.541 --> 51:47.333
to deliver our canister,
and then on to the submarine.

51:48.958 --> 51:52.625
-Dear God, what about the submarine?
-"How are you getting on with Eisenhower?"

51:52.708 --> 51:55.791
Cut and dried.
The letter must have a natural tone.

51:55.875 --> 51:57.958
"Hope all is well.
The General sends his best."

51:58.041 --> 52:00.375
Hmm, can't have them
cackling like two hens.

52:00.458 --> 52:02.541
Archie Nye and Harold Alexander
are old friends.

52:02.625 --> 52:04.916
I've had letters
from the bank manager with more zing.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.125
It's a first draft.

52:07.125 --> 52:10.958
And we can't allow personal flourishes
to distract from the military

52:11.041 --> 52:13.000
misinformation we need Hitler to swallow.

52:13.083 --> 52:15.208
No, unless we want to
bore him to death first.

52:16.166 --> 52:19.375
And now, Hester has asked me
if she can write the love letter

52:19.458 --> 52:21.250
we're putting in Major Martin's pocket.

52:21.333 --> 52:24.375
She should write it and then
submit it to your withering gaze.

52:28.541 --> 52:31.333
Do you know where
Jean stands with Sergeant Dearborn?

52:31.416 --> 52:32.708
-The American?
-Yes.

52:32.791 --> 52:34.125
I think she's moved on.

52:34.208 --> 52:35.583
Did she tell you that?

52:36.833 --> 52:39.333
You do see Jean outside of work,
don't you?

52:39.416 --> 52:43.291
We will occasionally work over dinner
to iron out Bill-and-Pam details

52:43.375 --> 52:45.125
for verisimilitude's sake.

52:45.208 --> 52:46.291
Verisimilitude.

52:46.791 --> 52:48.375
For instance, tonight,

52:49.041 --> 52:51.166
we are placing the ticket stubs

52:51.958 --> 52:54.916
as agreed next to
the receipt for Pam's ring

52:55.000 --> 52:56.416
in the major's breast pocket.

52:56.500 --> 52:58.000
Trouser pocket.

52:58.083 --> 53:00.458
His breast pocket
is where he keeps her photograph.

53:00.541 --> 53:01.833
Sorry we're late.

53:02.458 --> 53:03.916
It's bedlam out there!

53:04.000 --> 53:08.166
It's true. We're all like moles now,
scurrying around in the dark.

53:08.250 --> 53:11.416
One blind man leadeth another,
both fall in ye ditch.

53:22.458 --> 53:23.833
You out again tonight?

53:23.916 --> 53:27.833
My reputation as a slouch
must be upheld even in war.

53:28.541 --> 53:30.541
And you? Busy writing away?

53:31.625 --> 53:32.666
Writing what?

53:32.750 --> 53:35.458
-Supply requisitions, mostly.
-Aha.

53:39.083 --> 53:44.000
"Do you take the same size hat
or a larger size like Monty's?"

53:44.083 --> 53:45.041
Good, isn't it?

53:45.125 --> 53:48.000
The Spartan general. Big head, bigger ego.

53:48.666 --> 53:49.500
It's a joke.

53:49.583 --> 53:51.333
This is
hardly the place for jokes.

53:51.416 --> 53:54.333
Everyone feels it could do with
alterations and improvements.

53:54.416 --> 53:55.375
Everyone?

53:55.458 --> 53:58.833
The Twenty Committee, Chiefs of Staff,
Naval Intelligence, Q Branch,

53:58.916 --> 54:00.166
MI5, MI6.

54:00.250 --> 54:01.500


54:01.583 --> 54:05.083
To retard the decomposition,
the body must be tightly sealed.

54:05.583 --> 54:09.291
The canister's double skin
will be made from 22-gauge steel,

54:09.375 --> 54:11.208
then insulated with asbestos wool,

54:11.291 --> 54:12.208
and dry ice.

54:12.291 --> 54:13.791
Heat and oxygen,

54:13.875 --> 54:15.833
a corpse's deadly enemies.

54:15.916 --> 54:17.416
And the watch, what does it do?

54:18.000 --> 54:19.458
A buzz saw.

54:19.541 --> 54:21.541
Buzz saw? Is that code for--?

54:22.083 --> 54:23.083
For buzz saw.

54:23.833 --> 54:26.541
The bezel's edges
are filed into razor-sharp teeth.

54:27.750 --> 54:31.166
-♪ We'll all be lit up as ♪

54:31.250 --> 54:35.166
♪ The Strand was only more, much more ♪

54:35.250 --> 54:38.166
♪ And before the plot is played out ♪

54:38.250 --> 54:41.083
♪ They will fetch the Fire Brigade out ♪

54:41.166 --> 54:46.208
♪ To the lit-test up-est scene
You ever saw ♪

54:47.375 --> 54:49.416
So, what I'm asking, Lieutenant Jewell,

54:49.500 --> 54:52.875
is whether or not your submarine
could accommodate a 6-foot thermos?

54:52.958 --> 54:54.625
Well, technically, I suppose.

54:55.125 --> 54:58.541
But my crew on the Seraph are a sharp lot.
What would I tell them?

54:58.625 --> 55:01.916
Tell them it contains a top-secret
meteorological reporting apparatus.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.291
Sounds like the stuff of fiction.

55:03.375 --> 55:05.375
You're not a writer as well, are you?

55:06.208 --> 55:08.041
We're surrounded by them, you know.

55:08.125 --> 55:09.750
-Germans?
-Writers.

55:13.500 --> 55:18.083
"Please ask your ADC
to send me some oranges if possible."

55:18.583 --> 55:21.208
General Nye can't be
made to sound like a scrounger,

55:21.291 --> 55:23.250
even to the Germans.
Especially to the Germans.

55:23.333 --> 55:25.541
But he does need
to sound like a human,

55:25.625 --> 55:28.250
which is what I have
rather artfully achieved.

55:28.333 --> 55:30.166
Millions of lives are at stake.

55:30.666 --> 55:32.958
The letter will be revised
until everyone is satisfied.

55:35.125 --> 55:36.541
-Draft?
-Fourteen.

55:37.250 --> 55:39.166
With the day still young.

55:39.250 --> 55:40.208
We're out of time.

55:40.875 --> 55:44.000
Jewell can hold the submarine
for the next fortnight only.

55:44.083 --> 55:46.458
The Seraph is in Scotland,
docked at the Holy Loch.

55:46.541 --> 55:47.666
Not Siberia?

55:50.375 --> 55:52.583
You know the irony
of this preposterous stalemate

55:52.666 --> 55:55.208
is if Archie Nye were
composing this letter himself,

55:55.291 --> 55:58.541
he'd write it any damn way… he pleased.

56:06.333 --> 56:07.750
It's dull as ditchwater.

56:07.833 --> 56:11.458
General Nye is dull as ditchwater,
which is why a charmless and

56:11.541 --> 56:13.708
utterly boring letter is perfect.

56:14.208 --> 56:17.666
And the general was only too happy
to put pen to paper once I asked.

56:18.166 --> 56:19.625
Far be it for me to point out,

56:19.708 --> 56:22.791
but his version is a near carbon copy
of my very first draft.

56:23.291 --> 56:26.375
There is a chain of command,
and for you to go directly to Nye--

56:26.458 --> 56:29.208
Whatever punishment you deem fit, sir,
I will fully accept.

56:29.291 --> 56:32.708
Although General Nye did ask
why we hadn't come to him straight away.

56:33.791 --> 56:37.041
Admiral, Major Martin is overripe

56:37.833 --> 56:39.541
and must be launched on April the 30th,

56:39.625 --> 56:43.083
the next waning moon,
only two weeks away, and the only window

56:43.166 --> 56:44.916
where we have access to the Seraph.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.208
And in keeping
with the chain of command,

56:47.291 --> 56:49.916
it is you alone who can
grant us approval to proceed.

56:55.916 --> 56:59.750
To the most satisfying moment…

57:00.666 --> 57:01.500
Here, here.

57:02.041 --> 57:03.083
…of the last two months!

57:03.166 --> 57:05.375
-Cheers.
-Cheers to us.

57:05.458 --> 57:08.416
And Pam's letter, Hester,
how many revisions has that gone through?

57:08.500 --> 57:11.250
Oh, many, but I think
I finished a passable version today.

57:11.333 --> 57:14.083
Well then, we must hear it. Ladies
and gentleman, we have a love letter.

57:14.166 --> 57:16.791
It's your moment to shine, Hester,
a dry run before Fritz has a look.

57:16.875 --> 57:20.625
-Oh, I'm not one for the spotlight.
-Oh, what spotlight, Hes? It's just us.

57:21.666 --> 57:23.708
-Oh, no, I can't.
-Yes, you can,

57:23.791 --> 57:24.750
please, please.

57:24.833 --> 57:27.166
-Please.
-Well, if you're all so keen.

57:27.250 --> 57:28.833
-Yes, we are.
-We are.

57:41.125 --> 57:41.958
You read it.

57:59.333 --> 58:01.416
The Manor House.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.375
Marlborough, Wiltshire, Sunday 18th.

58:06.541 --> 58:07.875
"My dearest Bill,

58:08.791 --> 58:11.541
I think seeing
one's beloved off at the railway

58:11.625 --> 58:13.458
is the poorest form of sport."

58:14.166 --> 58:17.333
"A train going out
can leave a howling gap in one's days,

58:17.833 --> 58:19.541
and one has to try madly

58:19.625 --> 58:23.333
and quite in vain to fill it
with the things one used to enjoy."

58:26.333 --> 58:29.166
"Why did we have to meet
in the middle of a war?"

58:30.416 --> 58:33.708
"For if it weren't for this madness,
we might be married by now,

58:34.208 --> 58:37.625
and I wouldn't be in this
dreary office typing minutes all day."

58:39.458 --> 58:43.125
"That last lovely
golden day we spent together,

58:44.625 --> 58:46.625
I never wanted it to end."

58:47.625 --> 58:50.000
"And I know it has been said before,

58:50.916 --> 58:53.666
but I do wish that time could stand still,

58:54.541 --> 58:56.166
even for just a minute."

58:58.416 --> 59:01.750
"So don't let them
send you off into the blue

59:01.833 --> 59:05.041
the horrible way they do these days."

59:06.875 --> 59:09.916
"Now that we've found
each other out of the whole world,

59:10.000 --> 59:11.875
I don't think I could bear it."

59:14.333 --> 59:15.416
"All my love…

59:17.458 --> 59:18.291
Pam."

59:22.541 --> 59:23.750
Wait.

59:25.875 --> 59:26.875
You have an eyelash.

59:38.125 --> 59:39.666
I'll see you tomorrow.

59:50.541 --> 59:52.583
For you from upstairs.

1:00:18.166 --> 1:00:19.416
So you agree, then.

1:00:19.500 --> 1:00:22.041
Ivor Montagu is spying for the Russians.

1:00:22.916 --> 1:00:25.291
His file would
seem to indicate that he is.

1:00:25.833 --> 1:00:27.916
He hasn't revealed
Mincemeat to the Soviets.

1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.125
We would have
picked it up at Bletchley if he had.

1:00:30.208 --> 1:00:31.625
Now that's not to say that he won't.

1:00:31.708 --> 1:00:35.000
There is nothing to suggest that
Ewen discusses anything with his brother.

1:00:35.083 --> 1:00:36.750
And nothing to prove that he doesn't.

1:00:38.083 --> 1:00:41.166
Now, we could send Ewen to America
to be with his wife and children.

1:00:41.666 --> 1:00:43.875
Might make it easier
to keep an eye on his brother.

1:00:44.583 --> 1:00:46.666
You'll get the credit for Mincemeat,
should it succeed.

1:00:46.750 --> 1:00:48.416
It was your idea, after all.

1:00:49.625 --> 1:00:50.500
Or,

1:00:51.333 --> 1:00:52.791
we could keep him here.

1:00:53.625 --> 1:00:56.875
You are asking me
to spy on a man I work beside every day.

1:00:57.375 --> 1:01:00.333
I'm asking you
to assess the danger to your country.

1:01:02.458 --> 1:01:04.625
You also have a brother, don't you?

1:01:04.708 --> 1:01:07.583
Had a brother. Fallen in Chittagong.

1:01:07.666 --> 1:01:10.833
Hmm. And your mother is desperate
to have his body brought home.

1:01:14.083 --> 1:01:17.625
I've knocked on many doors, but…
so far, nothing.

1:01:19.416 --> 1:01:20.250
Until now.

1:01:26.708 --> 1:01:27.833
Fold the letter,

1:01:28.416 --> 1:01:30.541
but each fold only once.

1:01:31.500 --> 1:01:34.583
Then we'll photograph the folds.
If the letter is returned,

1:01:35.083 --> 1:01:37.708
the wear to the fibers will show
whether or not it's been opened.

1:01:38.916 --> 1:01:41.250
Then the eyelash idea,
which is a good one.

1:01:41.333 --> 1:01:42.791
What eyelash idea?

1:01:42.875 --> 1:01:44.750
We place an eyelash in the fold.

1:01:45.250 --> 1:01:48.708
If the lash is gone upon return, well,
it's another sign the letter's been read.

1:01:50.291 --> 1:01:53.541
The bigger worry is ensuring
that the letter arrives in Berlin.

1:01:55.333 --> 1:01:57.500
If it lands with the Spanish Navy,
there's a good chance

1:01:57.583 --> 1:02:00.083
they could return it to us
unopened and unread.

1:02:00.166 --> 1:02:02.166
That's if the letter arrives
in Spain at all.

1:02:03.250 --> 1:02:04.500
It's a big sea.

1:02:04.583 --> 1:02:07.166
Many detours await one little briefcase.

1:02:09.041 --> 1:02:10.125
Pam's letter?

1:02:13.041 --> 1:02:14.500
New love, so…

1:02:16.041 --> 1:02:18.375
handled, worn.

1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:21.125
And the photograph?

1:02:27.750 --> 1:02:29.041
And the briefcase?

1:02:45.041 --> 1:02:46.875
Let's slide him in and seal him up.

1:02:58.708 --> 1:03:00.750
He doesn't look like a driver for MI5.

1:03:01.250 --> 1:03:03.000
Looks like Errol Flynn.

1:03:03.083 --> 1:03:05.583
And what drink is he on, his fifth?

1:03:05.666 --> 1:03:06.708
Sixth, I think.

1:03:06.791 --> 1:03:09.375
Last round, Teddy,
and then we really must cut him off.

1:03:09.458 --> 1:03:11.916
It'll be
an interesting drive to Scotland.

1:03:13.166 --> 1:03:15.416
You should give Jock Horsfall a wink.

1:03:15.916 --> 1:03:18.208
He may be pickled, but he's also single.

1:03:18.708 --> 1:03:20.708
Except, you're seeing Roger.

1:03:22.041 --> 1:03:24.458
No, I haven't seen much of Roger,

1:03:24.541 --> 1:03:26.291
now we're so busy.

1:03:27.291 --> 1:03:29.833
-We were just friends.
-Ah, oh well.

1:03:30.500 --> 1:03:31.541
His loss.

1:03:32.541 --> 1:03:33.541
See you tomorrow.

1:03:42.250 --> 1:03:43.375
So, Jock,

1:03:43.458 --> 1:03:46.000
how many times
have you made the trip to Holy Loch?

1:03:46.083 --> 1:03:48.083
Oh, I can do it with my eyes closed.

1:03:48.625 --> 1:03:52.333
I sometimes have to if my
astigmatism is playing up.

1:03:52.416 --> 1:03:54.333
But dead of night's a jolly time to drive,

1:03:54.416 --> 1:03:59.000
and you'll have my van. Customized V8.
She can run upwards of 125 miles per hour.

1:03:59.083 --> 1:04:00.625
I was there, you know, when you thrashed

1:04:00.708 --> 1:04:02.791
those six BMWs at Donington Park.

1:04:03.291 --> 1:04:04.916
That was my Black Car.

1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:08.416
MI5 made me garage her

1:04:08.916 --> 1:04:11.416
now that I'm an official chauffeur.

1:04:12.416 --> 1:04:14.250
They say she's a menace on the road.

1:04:17.125 --> 1:04:19.083
But I do miss her.

1:04:25.125 --> 1:04:26.250
I'll give you a moment.

1:04:29.375 --> 1:04:33.750
So, this tin can of yours.
What's in it?

1:04:34.333 --> 1:04:36.583
Hmm? Oh, optical equipment.

1:04:36.666 --> 1:04:37.500
Bollocks.

1:04:39.041 --> 1:04:41.333
Do you know how high my clearance goes?

1:04:42.333 --> 1:04:43.291
It's a dead body.

1:04:44.791 --> 1:04:47.333
We're going to play
a humiliating trick on Hitler.

1:04:52.416 --> 1:04:55.916
-Is he even capable of driving now?
-I fear we're about to find out.

1:04:57.791 --> 1:04:58.916
Anyway, um,

1:04:59.541 --> 1:05:01.750
since it's Major Martin's last night.

1:05:21.916 --> 1:05:26.291
Seems strange, doesn't it?
Sending our dear Major off to die?

1:05:26.833 --> 1:05:28.916
You do know he's already dead.

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:32.416
In a way, yes, but in another,
he's very much alive,

1:05:32.500 --> 1:05:34.500
our clever, dashing man.

1:05:35.333 --> 1:05:37.833
Which is why I'd like
to thank you, Charles.

1:05:37.916 --> 1:05:39.750
It's been a grand adventure.

1:05:40.250 --> 1:05:41.291
For the two of you.

1:05:42.500 --> 1:05:43.791
For all of us.

1:05:46.833 --> 1:05:48.666
We gave Bill a life.

1:05:49.541 --> 1:05:51.833
One Glyndwr Michael never had.

1:05:51.916 --> 1:05:53.500
We gave him Pam.

1:05:57.166 --> 1:05:58.291
I wanted Pam.

1:06:02.541 --> 1:06:03.583
I only mean

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:08.708
that our imaginings
often surpass what is real, don't they?

1:06:11.541 --> 1:06:14.000
I come home every night to a bereft mother

1:06:14.083 --> 1:06:15.916
pining for her favorite son.

1:06:16.541 --> 1:06:18.208
Hester lives the spinster's life,

1:06:18.708 --> 1:06:21.000
working around the clock
rather than face an empty bed.

1:06:22.708 --> 1:06:24.750
Ewen's real life is off in America,

1:06:25.291 --> 1:06:27.666
where he must worry
about the safety of his wife and children

1:06:27.750 --> 1:06:28.875
until they return.

1:06:30.625 --> 1:06:32.166
Or did he not mention that to you?

1:06:33.916 --> 1:06:36.500
He said something about America.

1:06:41.583 --> 1:06:42.583
It's all a game

1:06:43.083 --> 1:06:44.500
to him, you know?

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:46.250
You do know that.

1:06:46.333 --> 1:06:47.166
All the

1:06:48.125 --> 1:06:50.125
dinners and dancing.

1:06:51.541 --> 1:06:52.833
Not that I blame him.

1:06:53.750 --> 1:06:56.875
Who wouldn't want the attentions
of a beautiful woman? But, um…

1:06:58.541 --> 1:07:02.666
There's even talk of Ewen
joining Iris and the children in America.

1:07:03.458 --> 1:07:05.958
Family should be together during wartime,

1:07:06.458 --> 1:07:07.666
don't you think?

1:07:09.583 --> 1:07:12.458
I think I stepped on your toe.

1:07:13.208 --> 1:07:15.375
Oh, well, at least it wasn't me for once.

1:07:15.458 --> 1:07:17.583
Got such a busy day tomorrow.

1:07:17.666 --> 1:07:19.000
I really must go.

1:07:30.500 --> 1:07:31.333
Jean.

1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:34.583
-Jean, you're not leaving.
-I am, obviously.

1:07:34.666 --> 1:07:35.500
But why?

1:07:36.458 --> 1:07:37.958
Jean, what just happened?

1:07:38.041 --> 1:07:42.875
I have been overcome
with embarrassment at my own stupidity.

1:07:43.375 --> 1:07:46.208
This game we've been playing.

1:07:46.708 --> 1:07:49.250
Bill and Pam, the young lovers,
as if you and I were--

1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.375
as if this weren't a real war.

1:07:54.125 --> 1:07:56.750
Do you not realize
people are talking about us?

1:07:56.833 --> 1:07:58.083
Is this about gossip?

1:07:59.208 --> 1:08:00.958
What-- what does it matter
what people say?

1:08:01.041 --> 1:08:02.750
We both know there's
nothing going on here.

1:08:05.416 --> 1:08:07.208
I don't-- I don't mean nothing, as in…

1:08:10.125 --> 1:08:14.000
I left behind childish games
many years ago, Ewen.

1:08:14.916 --> 1:08:16.916
The day I buried the man I loved.

1:08:19.333 --> 1:08:22.333
And while my life
may not look like much to you,

1:08:22.416 --> 1:08:25.375
I have made my way, alone

1:08:25.958 --> 1:08:28.833
with the occasional
admirer to pass the time.

1:08:31.041 --> 1:08:32.375
It's certainly easier

1:08:33.750 --> 1:08:34.625
and safer.

1:08:35.291 --> 1:08:36.125
So…

1:08:39.291 --> 1:08:41.041
You'll be late for your drive,

1:08:41.833 --> 1:08:43.041
and I'm going home.

1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:00.291
No dallying, ladies.

1:09:00.791 --> 1:09:02.333
We've a clock to beat.

1:09:02.416 --> 1:09:05.500
And we'll have to feel our way along,
thanks to the blackout.

1:09:06.583 --> 1:09:08.458
I saw you talking to Jean tonight.

1:09:09.333 --> 1:09:10.375
What were you saying?

1:09:10.458 --> 1:09:11.583
I was apologizing

1:09:12.083 --> 1:09:13.250
for my dancing.

1:09:17.666 --> 1:09:20.041
It's easier to accept death
when you can't see it coming.

1:09:58.625 --> 1:09:59.541
It's curious

1:10:01.333 --> 1:10:02.416
about your brother.

1:10:03.333 --> 1:10:04.208
My brother?

1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:08.375
You never speak of him.
He does live with you, doesn't he?

1:10:10.625 --> 1:10:11.708
He travels mostly.

1:10:12.750 --> 1:10:15.125
Although, I'm not sure
why that's any of your business.

1:10:16.208 --> 1:10:18.833
Or why you would
say something to upset Jean tonight.

1:10:21.416 --> 1:10:23.916
Godfrey thinks Ivor's a communist.

1:10:24.500 --> 1:10:27.458
-You've spoken to Godfrey about Ivor?
-Godfrey brought him up.

1:10:29.208 --> 1:10:31.333
Well, Godfrey despises eccentrics.

1:10:32.083 --> 1:10:33.875
Aren't all spies eccentrics?

1:10:34.375 --> 1:10:36.083
Ivor is a dilettante,

1:10:36.166 --> 1:10:40.000
an inveterate ne'er-do-well who founded
the Cheese Eaters League in Cambridge

1:10:40.083 --> 1:10:42.833
and the International
Table Tennis Federation in London.

1:10:43.833 --> 1:10:45.333
And his trips to Moscow?

1:10:46.833 --> 1:10:48.875
My brother joined
the British Socialist Party

1:10:48.958 --> 1:10:52.583
for five minutes, about as long as
his interest in anything lasts.

1:11:16.333 --> 1:11:19.416


1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:20.583
Down here!

1:11:25.625 --> 1:11:26.666
Excellent timing!

1:11:27.916 --> 1:11:29.291
Well ahead of schedule.

1:11:30.333 --> 1:11:33.250
But then I'd expect nothing less
from his Majesty's finest.

1:11:33.333 --> 1:11:34.333
Finest what?

1:11:34.833 --> 1:11:37.750
I think my testicles dislodged
somewhere near Dumfries.

1:11:40.083 --> 1:11:41.708
And good news, Lieutenant.

1:11:41.791 --> 1:11:43.625
I was able to honor your request.

1:11:43.708 --> 1:11:46.166
Much appreciated.
I know it was last-minute. Thank you.

1:11:46.250 --> 1:11:47.333
What request?

1:11:47.833 --> 1:11:50.666
Jewell was good enough
to find me a bunk on the Seraph.

1:11:50.750 --> 1:11:52.416
What do you mean "on the Seraph"?

1:11:52.500 --> 1:11:55.666
Someone should accompany Major Martin
to his final resting place.

1:11:55.750 --> 1:11:58.708
-That would be Spain.
-Yes, where the Seraph is headed.

1:11:59.208 --> 1:12:00.500
Are you out of your mind?

1:12:00.583 --> 1:12:02.708
We didn't get clearance
to go to Spain with him.

1:12:02.791 --> 1:12:03.833
We didn't even discuss it.

1:12:03.916 --> 1:12:07.958
Don't you think that one of us should show
some respect for a man who gave his life

1:12:08.041 --> 1:12:10.625
and who now serves us
and his country so nobly?

1:12:10.708 --> 1:12:11.958
If unwittingly.

1:12:13.125 --> 1:12:15.916
Don't you think at least one of us
ought to do the right thing?

1:12:22.875 --> 1:12:24.875
We're going straight through
back to London.

1:12:25.375 --> 1:12:26.250
Now!

1:12:27.541 --> 1:12:28.375
I'm driving.

1:13:03.333 --> 1:13:05.041
Do you know what time it is?

1:13:05.708 --> 1:13:06.791
I just need a moment.

1:13:09.541 --> 1:13:13.416
There's an apology I must make to you,
and then I promise I'll go.

1:13:16.166 --> 1:13:17.791
I wasn't being honest with you

1:13:18.791 --> 1:13:21.916
or even myself
when I said there's nothing between us.

1:13:24.833 --> 1:13:26.541
In fact, the very opposite is true.

1:13:29.375 --> 1:13:30.916
My life is complicated.

1:13:32.666 --> 1:13:36.500
It's not an excuse
or a defense or anything, really.

1:13:38.333 --> 1:13:39.500
Only to say…

1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:46.541
that my feelings for you are real.

1:13:49.458 --> 1:13:51.833
I should have
realized that a long time ago.

1:13:55.583 --> 1:13:58.333
And perhaps I might have spared you
the embarrassment of last night,

1:13:59.833 --> 1:14:01.333
because if I in any way--

1:14:01.416 --> 1:14:02.583
You didn't.

1:14:04.083 --> 1:14:06.750
I know you have a wife and family.

1:14:09.625 --> 1:14:10.458
I do.

1:14:13.458 --> 1:14:14.833
And you and I,

1:14:15.750 --> 1:14:16.916
we have a war to win.

1:14:18.291 --> 1:14:21.958
Major Martin is in dangerous waters now.

1:14:23.250 --> 1:14:24.708
He'll need us more than ever.

1:14:30.250 --> 1:14:31.916
I hope you're able to sleep.

1:16:02.750 --> 1:16:04.583
I left my Bible below deck, so…

1:16:12.208 --> 1:16:14.125
In the twinkling of an eye,

1:16:15.750 --> 1:16:17.166
at the last call,

1:16:18.541 --> 1:16:20.416
for the trumpet shall sound,

1:16:21.416 --> 1:16:24.500
and the dead
shall be raised incorruptible.

1:16:25.750 --> 1:16:27.750
And we shall all be changed.

1:16:32.250 --> 1:16:33.666
Have we heard anything?

1:16:33.750 --> 1:16:34.583
Not yet.

1:16:46.125 --> 1:16:48.416
I thought I might take a moment.

1:16:49.041 --> 1:16:50.541
Say a prayer to St. Jude.

1:16:56.666 --> 1:16:58.208
Should we pray for Major Martin?

1:17:01.041 --> 1:17:02.333
For Major Martin.

1:17:04.833 --> 1:17:06.708
For the success of our mission.

1:17:09.125 --> 1:17:10.291
For those we love.

1:17:49.875 --> 1:17:50.916
Marco!

1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:52.291
-What?
-Listen…

1:18:22.041 --> 1:18:25.000
And so, the hidden war continues.

1:18:29.875 --> 1:18:32.000
Lies are whispered anew.

1:18:33.708 --> 1:18:35.750
Shadows still flicker.

1:18:38.083 --> 1:18:42.041
Even the ground refuses
to steady in this wilderness of illusions.

1:18:47.750 --> 1:18:49.333
A man dies.

1:18:51.708 --> 1:18:53.833
Another begins his journey

1:18:55.541 --> 1:18:58.375
and waits for his story to be told.

1:19:02.041 --> 1:19:04.125
But in the conventional war,

1:19:04.208 --> 1:19:06.208
the wheels of combat turn,

1:19:06.708 --> 1:19:10.916
the forces of men
and machines swell until suddenly

1:19:11.416 --> 1:19:13.000
the die is cast.

1:19:14.041 --> 1:19:15.875
There is no turning back.

1:19:15.958 --> 1:19:18.750
U.S., Canadian,
and British forces will strike

1:19:18.833 --> 1:19:21.083
26 beaches over 100 miles

1:19:21.166 --> 1:19:23.083
of Sicily's southern shore.

1:19:23.583 --> 1:19:26.166
We'll be mobilizing 100,000 plus men,

1:19:26.250 --> 1:19:30.500
3,000 freighters and sweepers
with 1,800 heavy guns, 4,000 aircraft--

1:19:30.583 --> 1:19:32.916
Commander, if I may.
Does the build-up continue

1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:34.166
despite our intelligence?

1:19:34.666 --> 1:19:38.166
Intelligence that shows
Germans continue to reinforce Sicily.

1:19:38.250 --> 1:19:40.250
The prime minister still
hopes to turn the tide

1:19:40.333 --> 1:19:42.666
and convince Germany
that our target is Greece.

1:19:43.916 --> 1:19:46.750
He is now relying almost entirely on us,

1:19:47.583 --> 1:19:48.833
so we have work to do.

1:19:54.958 --> 1:19:56.500
-Morning Charles.
-Morning.

1:19:57.791 --> 1:19:58.916
Charles.

1:19:59.416 --> 1:20:01.875
-You don't look any the worse for wear.
-I should.

1:20:01.958 --> 1:20:04.833
There's a reason tall men
don't serve on small submarines.

1:20:10.875 --> 1:20:12.750
Hitler's still reinforcing Sicily.

1:20:12.833 --> 1:20:15.500
That can only mean
the other pieces of our deception plan--

1:20:15.583 --> 1:20:16.500
Have missed the mark.

1:20:18.083 --> 1:20:19.666
But Major Martin has washed ashore.

1:20:19.750 --> 1:20:22.125
Gomez-Beare has been
called by the Spanish police.

1:20:22.625 --> 1:20:24.000
Our plan proceeds.

1:20:24.958 --> 1:20:28.458
The fate of the Free World
dependent on a corpse and a donkey cart.

1:20:34.875 --> 1:20:36.000
All good.

1:20:36.083 --> 1:20:38.125
…from Cardiff Martín Willy.

1:20:38.208 --> 1:20:39.583
HUELVA ROMAN CATHOLIC CEMETERY

1:20:39.666 --> 1:20:42.708
And then look
what is inside that bag, please.

1:20:43.208 --> 1:20:46.541
Thanks for notifying me
a comrade of mine has fallen.

1:20:47.041 --> 1:20:50.458
I'm Judge Pascual del Pobil,
instructor of the Spanish Navy.

1:20:52.625 --> 1:20:56.291
I guess that would be
a complicated case for a local forensic.

1:20:56.375 --> 1:20:58.750
I'm Dr. del Torno,
provisional forensic

1:20:58.833 --> 1:21:02.333
and head of pathologic anatomy
department at a university in Madrid.

1:21:02.416 --> 1:21:03.916
The local forensic died.

1:21:04.916 --> 1:21:08.041
By the way,
I fired the local police of Huelva.

1:21:08.125 --> 1:21:11.916
They are corrupted
and controlled by the Nazis.

1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:14.833
I will take care of this personally.

1:21:14.916 --> 1:21:18.291
It is clear that your naval officer
was floating in water for quite some time.

1:21:18.375 --> 1:21:21.250
The critical task now is
to make the Germans think we are frantic

1:21:21.333 --> 1:21:24.500
to reclaim the papers, while guiding
the papers right into their hands.

1:21:24.583 --> 1:21:27.250
Since his personal objects
belong to the British government,

1:21:27.333 --> 1:21:28.708
you can take them with you.

1:21:30.416 --> 1:21:32.083
Me? Take them now?

1:21:32.166 --> 1:21:36.541
Yes. No need to go through my superiors,
Commander Gomez-Beare.

1:21:36.625 --> 1:21:40.833
The papers are yours
to return to your king.

1:21:42.250 --> 1:21:44.250
On the ground,
our Assistant Naval Attaché,

1:21:44.333 --> 1:21:46.458
Don Gomez-Beare, is with
the body now and will make sure

1:21:46.541 --> 1:21:48.125
the documents get to the German police.

1:21:48.208 --> 1:21:50.291
Also known as the Spanish police.

1:21:50.375 --> 1:21:52.375
I appreciate the offer.

1:21:52.458 --> 1:21:54.333
But there is a protocol,

1:21:54.416 --> 1:21:56.541
and we both know
the minds of naval superiors.

1:21:56.625 --> 1:21:58.125
Do you know mine?

1:21:58.833 --> 1:22:01.666
-Admiral Moreno?
-Moreno is a hopeless nitpicker.

1:22:01.750 --> 1:22:04.916
Moreno is a pain in the ass.

1:22:05.500 --> 1:22:08.500
So why rouse the beast?

1:22:09.166 --> 1:22:11.708
Better to gather the papers
and keep them here for safe-keeping,

1:22:11.791 --> 1:22:14.291
give a full report to Moreno later,
then return them to me.

1:22:14.375 --> 1:22:16.708
We could. But it is hot.

1:22:16.791 --> 1:22:18.750
Your man stinks.

1:22:18.833 --> 1:22:21.291
And lunch and a siesta
are only moments away.

1:22:21.375 --> 1:22:24.625
But they are watching, are they not?

1:22:26.916 --> 1:22:28.125
Those men.

1:22:29.833 --> 1:22:34.166
Fine, if you insist. The papers will go

1:22:34.250 --> 1:22:36.916
to our Naval Office in Huelva.

1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:41.208
In the meantime,
dear coroner, make this quick.

1:22:41.291 --> 1:22:44.333
I see no reason to rush.

1:22:44.416 --> 1:22:47.666
I specialized in drownings at the Academy,

1:22:47.750 --> 1:22:49.791
so I find this case of great interest.

1:22:51.083 --> 1:22:54.625
Specialized in drownings?

1:22:54.708 --> 1:22:58.750
Yes. If this case even is a drowning.

1:22:59.250 --> 1:23:01.166
Once the autopsy is complete,

1:23:01.750 --> 1:23:05.250
we'll work our end through David Ainsworth
at the British Embassy in Madrid.

1:23:05.333 --> 1:23:06.541
British Admiralty on the phone.

1:23:06.625 --> 1:23:09.833
The Germans have bugged the phones there,
so any message we pass to the embassy

1:23:09.916 --> 1:23:11.500
is essentially a message to Berlin.

1:23:11.583 --> 1:23:14.208
Oh, they asked that you
use the unsecured line.

1:23:15.833 --> 1:23:16.666
Ainsworth.

1:23:17.166 --> 1:23:19.500
-Captain, is your line secure?
-Of course.

1:23:19.583 --> 1:23:21.708
Good, 'cause we've
just received news

1:23:21.791 --> 1:23:23.500
that one of ours washed up in Huelva.

1:23:23.583 --> 1:23:25.250
Carrying top-secret documents

1:23:25.333 --> 1:23:27.625
General Nye's camp is
very anxious to recover.

1:23:27.708 --> 1:23:29.583
I'll begin inquiries right away.

1:23:29.666 --> 1:23:32.083
And the fact
that we're looking for papers at all

1:23:32.166 --> 1:23:33.333
must remain classified.

1:23:33.833 --> 1:23:34.875
Understood.

1:23:41.958 --> 1:23:46.083
Doctor, our man here has clearly drowned.

1:23:46.166 --> 1:23:48.791
His body has given up the ghost,
I think we can agree.

1:23:48.875 --> 1:23:53.583
There is only one decent thing
we can do now for his poor sodden soul.

1:23:56.416 --> 1:23:58.791
The burial is set for 0800 hours tomorrow?

1:23:58.875 --> 1:24:01.500
Only because
the expert pathologist from Madrid

1:24:01.583 --> 1:24:05.250
nixed the autopsy, thank Christ,
and not a moment too soon.

1:24:05.333 --> 1:24:09.833
The bad news is the Spanish Navy
in Huelva has the case under lock and key.

1:24:09.916 --> 1:24:12.875
Then our only hope is
helping Adolf Clauss get his hands on it.

1:24:12.958 --> 1:24:16.083
Before the case makes its way
to Admiral Moreno's office in Madrid.

1:24:16.166 --> 1:24:18.666
Well, the dung beetle
will surface soon enough.

1:24:18.750 --> 1:24:20.375
Nope, we need him
to surface sooner.

1:24:20.458 --> 1:24:24.041
We'll jolt him with an unencrypted cable
sent to your office tonight.

1:24:24.125 --> 1:24:26.958
Make casual request to Spanish Navy

1:24:27.916 --> 1:24:30.583
to return case and papers. Stop.

1:24:31.083 --> 1:24:33.041
Do not alert German interests

1:24:33.125 --> 1:24:36.250
to the necessity of securing

1:24:36.333 --> 1:24:39.791
these documents back
into British hands, stop.

1:24:40.291 --> 1:24:43.083
Unless you expect
a thank you from Herr Clauss,

1:24:43.708 --> 1:24:45.958
I think our work here tonight is done.

1:24:51.500 --> 1:24:53.375
Get the list through.
In the morning…

1:25:03.708 --> 1:25:07.000
I just saw the name Montagu.

1:25:08.208 --> 1:25:09.875
Ewen's wife, Iris.

1:25:10.916 --> 1:25:12.291
She and I correspond.

1:25:13.125 --> 1:25:15.291
We've known each other
for years, of course.

1:25:32.500 --> 1:25:33.500
Jean!

1:25:35.125 --> 1:25:36.041
Jean!

1:25:38.750 --> 1:25:40.583
Goodness! Roger!

1:25:40.666 --> 1:25:42.875
I am so sorry. I've been meaning to--

1:25:42.958 --> 1:25:45.958
No, no. It's okay.
I'm just disappointed since

1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:48.916
it feels like I barely
got to say hello to you,

1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:50.791
and now I have to say goodbye.

1:25:52.291 --> 1:25:54.791
The boys and I are
shipping out in the morning.

1:25:55.500 --> 1:25:56.583
In the morning?

1:25:57.083 --> 1:25:59.958
-Where?
-I'm not at liberty to say, but, uh…

1:26:00.458 --> 1:26:03.500
Well, I don't know
when we'll see each other again, so…

1:26:05.916 --> 1:26:08.833
Wherever it is, Roger,
I do hope you'll be safe.

1:26:09.416 --> 1:26:11.041
May I write to you?

1:26:11.125 --> 1:26:12.375
Of course.

1:26:13.041 --> 1:26:14.958
Please write.

1:26:23.708 --> 1:26:24.708
Goodbye.

1:26:39.083 --> 1:26:42.458
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

1:26:42.541 --> 1:26:43.458
Amen.

1:26:44.875 --> 1:26:46.083
Jesus Christ…

1:26:46.166 --> 1:26:48.458
It will be my funeral next.

1:26:49.250 --> 1:26:53.625
I should've taken that
bloody briefcase when I had the chance.

1:26:53.708 --> 1:26:57.208
My superiors are frantic for it.

1:26:57.708 --> 1:26:59.958
Perhaps the case is already en route.

1:27:00.458 --> 1:27:02.541
To where? Have you heard gossip?

1:27:03.833 --> 1:27:07.083
This is a small town, Lieutenant.
Treacherously small.

1:27:07.583 --> 1:27:09.500
The chair maker has been asking questions.

1:27:13.041 --> 1:27:13.958
Adolf.

1:27:14.041 --> 1:27:15.541
What a pleasant surprise.

1:27:17.916 --> 1:27:19.708
Quite the turnout for our man.

1:27:23.250 --> 1:27:26.541
So, Adolf Clauss
turned out to be two steps behind…

1:27:29.125 --> 1:27:31.333
…because the briefcase
has landed in Madrid.

1:27:31.416 --> 1:27:32.541
Dear God.

1:27:32.625 --> 1:27:35.916
Which means it will be
in Admiral Moreno's office shortly.

1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.708
But let's hope
that Kuhlenthal can't be far behind.

1:27:39.625 --> 1:27:42.041
And since we've bugged
every office in Naval Headquarters--

1:27:42.125 --> 1:27:43.375
Not every office. Not Moreno's.

1:27:43.458 --> 1:27:46.083
-Admiral Moreno.
-Come with me, please.

1:27:47.083 --> 1:27:48.875
We need to know
what Moreno's up to,

1:27:48.958 --> 1:27:50.833
David, so you'll have to improvise.

1:27:51.333 --> 1:27:53.000
Time to look up old friends.

1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:57.125
I need to hear
that conversation.

1:28:11.583 --> 1:28:13.500
I've missed you, Captain.

1:28:22.541 --> 1:28:24.541
I heard
the whole conversation.

1:28:24.625 --> 1:28:26.666
Moreno denied having the papers,

1:28:26.750 --> 1:28:29.125
while Kuhlenthal
insisted he did have the papers.

1:28:30.500 --> 1:28:32.833
Did Kuhlenthal get hold of the case?

1:28:32.916 --> 1:28:34.125
Unfortunately not.

1:28:34.208 --> 1:28:36.041
Moreno wasn't open for business.

1:28:36.125 --> 1:28:40.000
Dear God! It's hard to see who's more
up a tree with this, us or the Germans.

1:28:40.083 --> 1:28:42.458
I would say Kuhlenthal is
desperate enough for us all.

1:28:44.333 --> 1:28:47.750
The bug in his office caught him
eviscerating Clauss for not

1:28:47.833 --> 1:28:49.416
snatching the papers in Huelva.

1:28:51.333 --> 1:28:52.583
So he should.

1:28:52.666 --> 1:28:55.500
And the Spanish Navy can't seem to
stop reminding us how neutral they are.

1:28:55.583 --> 1:28:57.666
They won't let the Germans
anywhere near our briefcase.

1:28:57.750 --> 1:29:00.000
Colonel Cerruti could
get hold of the papers.

1:29:00.083 --> 1:29:01.083
Cerruti?

1:29:01.583 --> 1:29:03.583
Spain's secret police
are beyond treacherous.

1:29:03.666 --> 1:29:06.416
They are, but he's
a keen fascist. He's devoted to Hitler.

1:29:06.500 --> 1:29:10.000
And we have no other choice.
We have to get the papers to Kuhlenthal.

1:29:10.083 --> 1:29:13.250
Colonel Cerruti
ran me as a double agent years ago

1:29:13.333 --> 1:29:16.125
without ever realizing
I was a triple agent for our side.

1:29:16.208 --> 1:29:19.041
But I've steered clear
of the Colonel for some time now.

1:29:19.125 --> 1:29:20.125
He's gone dry?

1:29:20.208 --> 1:29:21.458
He requires

1:29:22.583 --> 1:29:23.666
careful handling.

1:29:23.750 --> 1:29:25.875
Are you here
because you missed me, David?

1:29:26.875 --> 1:29:29.625
We sympathize, David,
but Churchill has put his money on us.

1:29:29.708 --> 1:29:32.916
We cannot tell the prime minister
that we've hit a dead end now.

1:29:38.125 --> 1:29:42.333
I am here, Colonel,
out of our shared duty to the Fuhrer.

1:29:44.250 --> 1:29:48.708
Admiral Moreno insists
they know nothing of British documents

1:29:49.625 --> 1:29:52.791
we know are in his possession.

1:29:53.791 --> 1:29:57.458
Papers the Fuhrer needs to see.

1:30:01.375 --> 1:30:03.375
And what is in the documents?

1:30:05.625 --> 1:30:09.041
Something the British
are very keen to hide.

1:30:12.208 --> 1:30:15.875
Now, I know Moreno is incorruptible…

1:30:17.750 --> 1:30:19.041
but in your hands…

1:30:21.916 --> 1:30:23.333
And what of your hands?

1:31:52.291 --> 1:31:53.458
I need some air.

1:31:57.541 --> 1:32:01.541
There's no mention of Cerruti
or Kuhlenthal in any of these transcripts.

1:32:01.625 --> 1:32:03.625
We don't know if Cerruti met with Moreno,

1:32:03.708 --> 1:32:05.958
or if he even took the case,
or if he read the letter.

1:32:06.458 --> 1:32:08.208
We are utterly in the dark.

1:32:08.291 --> 1:32:11.041
Is that what
Charles and M were discussing?

1:32:11.916 --> 1:32:13.583
Charles and Godfrey?

1:32:13.666 --> 1:32:14.500
When?

1:32:14.583 --> 1:32:17.583
Yesterday. I saw them
outside talking alone.

1:32:17.666 --> 1:32:19.125
And you're telling me this now?

1:32:19.208 --> 1:32:21.416
I wasn't aware
I was supposed to tell you

1:32:21.500 --> 1:32:22.750
or anyone.

1:32:26.708 --> 1:32:29.083
He can be like this
when he's under pressure.

1:32:29.166 --> 1:32:31.000
You mustn't take it personally.

1:32:31.541 --> 1:32:33.625
The waiting's driving us all mad.

1:32:36.666 --> 1:32:39.708
Why does Ewen's wife write to you

1:32:40.458 --> 1:32:41.583
and not to him?

1:32:47.583 --> 1:32:49.166
Every marriage has its

1:32:49.666 --> 1:32:51.625
difficulties and disappointments.

1:32:52.666 --> 1:32:55.250
Haven't we all had our
hearts broken over the years?

1:32:56.708 --> 1:32:58.791
What's hard to understand about Ewen,

1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:01.500
hidden beneath all the bluster

1:33:02.375 --> 1:33:04.958
is his very deep sense of duty.

1:33:06.833 --> 1:33:08.125
I only say this

1:33:08.791 --> 1:33:10.958
because I'm so very fond of you

1:33:11.583 --> 1:33:12.583
and him.

1:33:14.375 --> 1:33:15.375
And her.

1:33:24.375 --> 1:33:26.333
Moreno's on his way to the embassy.

1:33:27.208 --> 1:33:29.541
And Kuhlenthal has just left for Berlin.

1:33:30.958 --> 1:33:32.833
Captain,
this traveling case

1:33:32.916 --> 1:33:34.083
has come into our possession.

1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:36.625
We don't know its contents.

1:33:37.375 --> 1:33:40.333
We do know it's the property
of the British government.

1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:43.833
And at times like these, with countries
at war and allegiances so fragile,

1:33:44.333 --> 1:33:46.666
Spain wishes to see
its safe return to its owner.

1:33:48.458 --> 1:33:50.125
Thank you very much.

1:33:54.041 --> 1:33:57.000
So, the moment of truth.

1:34:07.250 --> 1:34:09.041
The seal hasn't been touched.

1:34:09.541 --> 1:34:11.250
Meaning the letter hasn't been read.

1:34:11.333 --> 1:34:13.291
Let's not hang ourselves just yet.

1:34:13.791 --> 1:34:15.791
One can, with great delicacy,

1:34:16.375 --> 1:34:18.333
remove a letter without
fully opening the envelope.

1:34:18.916 --> 1:34:21.333
If the gum has been dissolved in solvent.

1:34:21.416 --> 1:34:22.333
Or seawater.

1:34:22.416 --> 1:34:24.250
Yes. Yes, seawater.

1:34:31.833 --> 1:34:34.166
It is possible to insert here,

1:34:34.666 --> 1:34:38.500
grab the edge of the letter,
and then, ever so gently… twist.

1:34:38.583 --> 1:34:40.750
So it is possible they removed the letter?

1:34:40.833 --> 1:34:44.666
Twisting like this
causes the pages to curl,

1:34:44.750 --> 1:34:46.958
but, uh, once back
in the envelope, of course,

1:34:47.041 --> 1:34:48.166
the letter will lie flat.

1:34:48.250 --> 1:34:50.958
So how is a curl we cannot see helpful?

1:34:52.166 --> 1:34:55.375
Um, it isn't. It-- It isn't.

1:34:55.958 --> 1:34:59.250
Unless we wet the paper again,
dry it, and see what happens.

1:35:00.250 --> 1:35:01.958
It looks as if the eyelash is gone.

1:35:02.958 --> 1:35:07.000
We are not sending 100,000 men
into battle on a missing eyelash.

1:35:12.833 --> 1:35:14.500
So it has been opened.

1:35:15.333 --> 1:35:19.916
This letter has been removed
from the envelope, and it has been opened.

1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:21.458
Which means it's been read.

1:35:49.541 --> 1:35:50.750
Teddy!

1:35:51.625 --> 1:35:52.833
What on earth--

1:35:52.916 --> 1:35:54.541
-Why?
-Why am I not at the club?

1:35:54.625 --> 1:35:56.125
I don't work there anymore.

1:35:57.916 --> 1:35:59.250
Strange, isn't it?

1:36:00.416 --> 1:36:04.875
To find an old photograph of you
amongst Major Martin's papers.

1:36:06.208 --> 1:36:08.625
I don't recall seeing him
at the Gargoyle, Jean.

1:36:10.083 --> 1:36:12.208
Or, do I call you Pam?

1:36:22.083 --> 1:36:23.000
"Dearest Bill,

1:36:23.500 --> 1:36:26.166
why did we have to meet
in the middle of a war?"

1:36:26.958 --> 1:36:29.125
"For if it
weren't for this madness,

1:36:29.208 --> 1:36:31.250
we might have been married by now."

1:36:32.125 --> 1:36:34.375
I don't understand what you're doing.

1:36:34.458 --> 1:36:35.541
There are Germans,

1:36:36.125 --> 1:36:37.500
good Germans,

1:36:38.583 --> 1:36:40.291
in positions of great influence

1:36:40.375 --> 1:36:43.458
that are allied
in their desire to see the Fuhrer fall.

1:36:44.875 --> 1:36:49.750
But these men
have been rebuffed by your superiors,

1:36:49.833 --> 1:36:52.250
labeled "the anti-Hitler hoax,"

1:36:52.333 --> 1:36:55.083
which is a shame
since we both are on the same side.

1:37:00.583 --> 1:37:03.250
My German friends need
to understand what's happened here.

1:37:04.416 --> 1:37:08.791
So, you will tell me about
Major Martin and the letters in his case,

1:37:08.875 --> 1:37:11.625
or I will pull out my gun
and put a bullet in your head.

1:37:30.208 --> 1:37:31.208
We just got this,

1:37:31.291 --> 1:37:34.041
the latest intercept sent by General Jodl,

1:37:34.125 --> 1:37:37.250
Nazi Chief of Operations.
It says, and I quote,

1:37:37.333 --> 1:37:41.500
"Enemy landings
on a large scale are expected in Greece

1:37:41.583 --> 1:37:43.833
in the very near future." In Greece.

1:37:44.416 --> 1:37:46.708
It came through
at the highest level of encryption.

1:37:47.208 --> 1:37:48.166
Do we believe this?

1:37:50.125 --> 1:37:51.208
General Jodl.

1:37:51.958 --> 1:37:53.625
We couldn't ask for
a more credible source.

1:37:53.708 --> 1:37:56.375
And if the Nazis were
moving troops from Sicily to Greece,

1:37:56.458 --> 1:37:58.333
it would be Jodl that's moving them.

1:38:06.166 --> 1:38:07.000
Q Branch.

1:38:08.416 --> 1:38:09.583
Yes. Yes, he is.

1:38:11.916 --> 1:38:13.416
Yes, I'll tell him right away.

1:38:14.583 --> 1:38:18.333
The man served us drinks
every night, Ewen! It was your club!

1:38:18.416 --> 1:38:20.416
You don't think
I vetted every single employee

1:38:20.500 --> 1:38:21.708
in and out of the Gargoyle?

1:38:21.791 --> 1:38:24.625
You don't think I'm aware of everyone
around me who might be listening?

1:38:24.708 --> 1:38:26.666
Well, you know,
we can't ask Teddy what happened

1:38:26.750 --> 1:38:28.958
because his flat's been searched,
and he's vanished!

1:38:29.041 --> 1:38:31.666
Every Nazi operative
within our borders has either been turned

1:38:31.750 --> 1:38:32.750
or eliminated long ago.

1:38:32.833 --> 1:38:35.791
We monitor everyone who might
remotely constitute a fifth column.

1:38:35.875 --> 1:38:37.333
We have eyes on every Blackshirt.

1:38:37.416 --> 1:38:39.333
Well then, who is this man? Who is he?

1:38:44.250 --> 1:38:46.625
Jean, are you sure
that he didn't give you a name?

1:38:46.708 --> 1:38:48.916
He didn't indicate
who might have sent him?

1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:49.833
Just,

1:38:49.916 --> 1:38:52.166
Just the Germans fighting against Hitler.

1:38:53.250 --> 1:38:55.958
-I assumed it was a lie.
-It most likely was a lie.

1:38:56.041 --> 1:38:57.583
Well, he was trying to get you to talk.

1:38:57.666 --> 1:38:59.208
But I did talk.

1:39:00.291 --> 1:39:02.750
I said, yes, I worked at the Admiralty.

1:39:03.750 --> 1:39:05.041
And the officer that died,

1:39:05.125 --> 1:39:08.083
he was using an alias
traveling with a fake dossier.

1:39:08.166 --> 1:39:09.166
He was a spy.

1:39:09.250 --> 1:39:13.166
But that he was also
transporting real classified material,

1:39:13.791 --> 1:39:15.291
real letters.

1:39:15.375 --> 1:39:17.208
It was ridiculous, but

1:39:17.291 --> 1:39:19.958
what could I say?
He had the photograph.

1:39:20.458 --> 1:39:22.208
I gave you that photograph.

1:39:22.291 --> 1:39:23.750
Jean, this is not your fault.

1:39:23.833 --> 1:39:25.833
But they know
the photograph isn't real.

1:39:25.916 --> 1:39:27.583
They'll suspect everything now.

1:39:27.666 --> 1:39:29.500
We don't even know who they are.

1:39:30.666 --> 1:39:32.125
You're not safe here.

1:39:33.208 --> 1:39:36.458
I have a guestroom. You can
stay there until we all sort this out.

1:39:45.458 --> 1:39:47.500
You would bring her to your own house?

1:39:47.583 --> 1:39:50.583
Have you no shame after you've
jeopardized this entire operation?

1:39:50.666 --> 1:39:51.708
You approached Jean.

1:39:51.791 --> 1:39:53.875
You're the one
who insisted on using her photograph!

1:39:53.958 --> 1:39:56.875
You're so busy seducing her that you
took your eye off your own brother.

1:39:56.958 --> 1:39:58.458
You think I told Ivor about Mincemeat?

1:39:58.541 --> 1:40:00.958
-How do we know he's not behind this?
-I tell him nothing!

1:40:01.041 --> 1:40:03.541
Because you know he's
a spy in bed with the Russians!

1:40:03.625 --> 1:40:05.875
Don't you tell me
what I know and don't know.

1:40:06.375 --> 1:40:09.041
You don't think I imagine myself
at his funeral every day?

1:40:09.125 --> 1:40:11.458
My own brother,
tried and hanged for treason.

1:40:11.541 --> 1:40:12.708
How fucking dare you?

1:40:12.791 --> 1:40:15.125
I am not the one who is running
a covert operation

1:40:15.208 --> 1:40:17.541
with a spy under my roof!

1:40:23.458 --> 1:40:24.291
No.

1:40:25.958 --> 1:40:27.666
No, your brother's a war hero.

1:40:29.125 --> 1:40:30.333
And I envy you that.

1:40:33.333 --> 1:40:35.000
Whatever went wrong, it wasn't Ivor.

1:40:35.083 --> 1:40:37.541
You are a careless bastard, Montagu.

1:40:39.875 --> 1:40:41.416
You're careless with Jean,

1:40:42.250 --> 1:40:45.416
you're careless with your brother,
and you're careless with your own wife.

1:40:50.583 --> 1:40:53.083
I don't need you to remind me of my sins.

1:40:55.541 --> 1:40:58.125
I only wonder how you
reconcile yourself with yours.

1:41:00.583 --> 1:41:02.208
You strike some sort of deal?

1:41:03.708 --> 1:41:04.708
Spying on me.

1:41:06.291 --> 1:41:08.416
My hide in exchange for…

1:41:10.333 --> 1:41:11.166
what?

1:41:20.375 --> 1:41:21.708
I need to look after Jean.

1:41:25.958 --> 1:41:29.208
Everything depends on finding out
who sent that man and why.

1:41:30.708 --> 1:41:32.958
What if it was Von Roenne?

1:41:37.125 --> 1:41:39.208
More than anyone else
in German intelligence,

1:41:40.875 --> 1:41:43.541
Von Roenne would need to
know if Mincemeat is true.

1:41:46.333 --> 1:41:48.875
So he could decide
if what he's whispering in Hitler's ear

1:41:48.958 --> 1:41:50.666
is fact or fiction.

1:41:53.333 --> 1:41:57.208
Because Von Roenne may be
the one who is fighting the other war.

1:41:58.833 --> 1:42:00.041
The secret war.

1:42:01.083 --> 1:42:04.541
The war dedicated
to seeing Hitler destroyed.

1:42:08.875 --> 1:42:10.166
Either that's true,

1:42:11.041 --> 1:42:13.333
or it's a fiction that we want to be true.

1:42:15.916 --> 1:42:16.875
What's fact

1:42:17.583 --> 1:42:21.000
is that you know I suspected my brother
of spying and refused to turn him in.

1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.916
So, you know enough
to see me ruined and my brother hanged.

1:42:30.541 --> 1:42:32.500
So the next move is yours, Charles.

1:42:34.541 --> 1:42:35.500
What's it to be?

1:42:59.500 --> 1:43:01.083
What we know for certain…

1:43:04.958 --> 1:43:09.166
is that within our borders,
our eyes and ears missed nothing.

1:43:10.291 --> 1:43:12.333
German spies, Nazi sympathizers,

1:43:12.416 --> 1:43:14.375
we know where they are.
We know who they are.

1:43:15.583 --> 1:43:17.500
Which means that whoever this man is,

1:43:18.958 --> 1:43:21.250
it's not something
we've encountered before.

1:43:23.416 --> 1:43:24.625
That's your excuse

1:43:25.125 --> 1:43:27.666
for using a photograph
of one of our own operatives?

1:43:27.750 --> 1:43:29.041
The photograph was my error, sir.

1:43:29.125 --> 1:43:31.625
I was the one who insisted on
choosing someone within our ranks.

1:43:31.708 --> 1:43:33.541
The woman is beside the point.

1:43:35.083 --> 1:43:38.666
I just wish I could find even a sliver
of satisfaction in having predicted this

1:43:38.750 --> 1:43:40.666
fucking disaster months ago.

1:43:42.958 --> 1:43:44.833
I'm still receiving intelligence.

1:43:44.916 --> 1:43:49.291
-The Germans are preparing for Greece.
-It could be a ruse.

1:43:49.375 --> 1:43:51.666
It's obviously a ruse,
given the operation's been revealed.

1:43:51.750 --> 1:43:53.791
Although, not necessarily, sir.

1:43:55.708 --> 1:43:57.458
Montagu and I
have been racking our brains,

1:43:58.333 --> 1:43:59.250
trying to

1:43:59.833 --> 1:44:02.875
decode the message
behind this contact with us.

1:44:03.541 --> 1:44:05.166
Why did this man reveal himself?

1:44:05.750 --> 1:44:07.041
If he's an agent for the Adwehr,

1:44:07.125 --> 1:44:09.875
why would he deliberately signal
that he'd discovered our deception?

1:44:09.958 --> 1:44:10.833
It doesn't add up,

1:44:11.458 --> 1:44:14.166
which is why the troop movements
to Greece may not be a ruse after all.

1:44:14.250 --> 1:44:17.416
Why would the Nazis continue to act
on information they know to be false?

1:44:17.500 --> 1:44:19.333
Because Von Roenne is
telling them to act on it.

1:44:19.416 --> 1:44:22.541
There's not a shred of proof
of this so-called anti-Hitler plot.

1:44:22.625 --> 1:44:25.000
We don't know that it isn't true, either.

1:44:25.625 --> 1:44:28.791
-Christ.
-Admiral, this man came out of nowhere.

1:44:28.875 --> 1:44:31.458
Perhaps he is the proof
of the anti-Hitler plot.

1:44:31.541 --> 1:44:34.166
And he contacted us
so that we would know the plot is real.

1:44:34.250 --> 1:44:36.541
And as German troops
continue to move towards Greece,

1:44:36.625 --> 1:44:38.250
we would continue to plan for Sicily.

1:44:38.333 --> 1:44:41.750
So that Von Roenne can
reinforce that misinformation with Hitler,

1:44:41.833 --> 1:44:42.916
leaving Sicily undefended.

1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:44.875
That is our instinct.

1:44:46.166 --> 1:44:47.708
That is your instinct?

1:44:49.666 --> 1:44:51.541
The fate of the world at stake,

1:44:52.041 --> 1:44:55.333
the Nazi killing machine
waiting for us on Sicily's shores, and…

1:44:57.041 --> 1:44:58.833
you two with your instinct.

1:45:01.458 --> 1:45:02.750
If it were up to me,

1:45:03.625 --> 1:45:06.916
I would postpone Sicily
and have you drawn and quartered.

1:45:10.250 --> 1:45:12.500
No doubt the prime minister
has been informed?

1:45:14.416 --> 1:45:15.375
What does he want to do?

1:45:16.250 --> 1:45:17.625
The prime minister

1:45:19.208 --> 1:45:22.333
does not want to postpone Sicily.

1:45:24.916 --> 1:45:27.541
I pray we can all live
with the consequences.

1:45:33.750 --> 1:45:34.583
Jean?

1:45:43.166 --> 1:45:44.041
Jean?

1:45:55.625 --> 1:45:56.791
He's coming home.

1:45:58.708 --> 1:46:00.250
Robbie's coming home.

1:46:07.666 --> 1:46:10.166
Thank you, my son.

1:46:18.625 --> 1:46:20.583
And this is a posting, where?

1:46:22.250 --> 1:46:24.333
-They haven't told me yet.
-They?

1:46:24.416 --> 1:46:25.500
Special Operations.

1:46:25.583 --> 1:46:27.500
I was accepted today.

1:46:28.541 --> 1:46:31.375
I suspect because Masterman
put in a good word for me.

1:46:32.083 --> 1:46:37.541
Hopefully, I'll find my way overseas
as a courier or a radio operator.

1:46:37.625 --> 1:46:38.458
I see.

1:46:41.250 --> 1:46:44.958
I can never forgive myself
for placing our operation in peril.

1:46:45.041 --> 1:46:47.000
I won't hear it.
What happened is not your fault.

1:46:47.083 --> 1:46:50.791
Regardless, it'll take
the grace of God and nerves of steel

1:46:50.875 --> 1:46:52.666
to land Mincemeat safely now.

1:46:52.750 --> 1:46:55.750
The kind of fortitude
you have demonstrated every single day.

1:46:55.833 --> 1:46:58.958
I've played my part
in the Bill and Pam story, Ewen.

1:46:59.541 --> 1:47:01.541
It's time for me to go where I'm needed.

1:47:01.625 --> 1:47:02.958
You're needed here…

1:47:04.333 --> 1:47:05.166
with us.

1:47:05.250 --> 1:47:06.750
I have to go.

1:47:20.666 --> 1:47:22.458
You will have your own story, then.

1:47:23.958 --> 1:47:25.500
You will fight your own war.

1:47:27.041 --> 1:47:28.541
You will serve bravely.

1:47:31.208 --> 1:47:32.791
Our country will be lucky to have you.

1:47:36.041 --> 1:47:37.000
And I…

1:47:37.625 --> 1:47:41.250
You will be reunited
with your wife and children.

1:47:44.458 --> 1:47:45.583
A better man.

1:47:50.125 --> 1:47:51.708
A man you brought back to life.

1:47:55.916 --> 1:47:57.083
I will miss you

1:47:58.083 --> 1:47:59.250
so terribly.

1:48:14.958 --> 1:48:17.291
The invasion fleet
is now assembled.

1:48:19.041 --> 1:48:20.875
The Seraph will be the lead vessel

1:48:20.958 --> 1:48:23.791
in the first wave
of the U.S. assault on Licata beach.

1:48:24.958 --> 1:48:27.166
Our job will be
to set the sonar homing buoy

1:48:28.083 --> 1:48:29.833
to guide the others to shore.

1:48:29.916 --> 1:48:32.708
A great many others,
we hear, on many beaches.

1:48:33.375 --> 1:48:35.791
The largest amphibious
assault the war has seen.

1:48:38.708 --> 1:48:40.541
Do you believe
we have Fritz where we need him?

1:48:42.083 --> 1:48:45.125
It seems the enemy
has fallen for the deception.

1:48:45.750 --> 1:48:50.291
We expect resistance to be
limited to Italian coastal divisions.

1:48:51.833 --> 1:48:53.750
Then our fighting men thank you.

1:49:02.166 --> 1:49:03.625
I will see you on the other side.

1:49:17.083 --> 1:49:18.166
I may vomit.

1:49:19.250 --> 1:49:20.708
I may vomit with you.

1:49:23.916 --> 1:49:26.208
Every, uh, piece of intelligence

1:49:26.291 --> 1:49:29.041
says that the Nazis
are waiting for us in Greece.

1:49:30.750 --> 1:49:33.291
And every piece of intelligence
may be the greatest deception

1:49:33.375 --> 1:49:35.625
the Nazis have ever played against us.

1:49:41.416 --> 1:49:44.375
Why do you think
Churchill still believes this can work?

1:49:47.541 --> 1:49:48.833
Because he has to.

1:49:54.666 --> 1:49:55.750
Jean has gone.

1:49:58.125 --> 1:49:58.958
Yes.

1:49:59.458 --> 1:50:00.416
I heard.

1:50:11.541 --> 1:50:13.375
You've had another letter from Iris.

1:50:15.458 --> 1:50:16.666
This one's for you.

1:50:59.125 --> 1:51:04.416
It is only fitting that the two wars
finally converge in darkness.

1:51:11.375 --> 1:51:13.375
The target is no longer hidden.

1:51:15.041 --> 1:51:16.750
The points are set.

1:51:18.916 --> 1:51:20.666
And the forces gather.

1:51:28.875 --> 1:51:29.791
Brave men.

1:51:31.333 --> 1:51:33.708
Their lives hanging in the balance.

1:51:34.750 --> 1:51:37.083
Their fate unknowable.

1:51:38.541 --> 1:51:40.875
Their part in history unwritten.

1:51:40.958 --> 1:51:43.916
-Action stations, action stations!

1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:45.000
Move yourself!

1:51:45.083 --> 1:51:46.583
Move, move, move!

1:51:49.625 --> 1:51:53.958
But who in these last hours
will bear witness to the hidden war…

1:51:56.583 --> 1:51:58.750
…unseen by history,

1:52:00.250 --> 1:52:02.541
locked away in a buried file?

1:52:03.833 --> 1:52:07.333
Its tragedies and triumphs unspoken.

1:52:08.083 --> 1:52:10.500
Its heroes unsung.

1:52:11.041 --> 1:52:13.208
In God's name, Fleming,
what are you writing?

1:52:13.833 --> 1:52:15.541
Spy story.

1:52:21.541 --> 1:52:23.083
It is in this moment…

1:52:25.041 --> 1:52:27.916
this suspended moment…

1:52:31.333 --> 1:52:34.833
that my story waits for an ending.

1:52:40.416 --> 1:52:42.416
As if fate herself…

1:52:44.333 --> 1:52:46.000
were a blank page.

1:53:24.416 --> 1:53:27.125
Medic!

1:53:46.625 --> 1:53:49.208
An ending redeemed in righteousness.

1:53:56.750 --> 1:53:59.666
An ending graced with mercy.

1:54:33.958 --> 1:54:35.375
"Allied forces

1:54:36.750 --> 1:54:37.791
have landed."

1:54:41.166 --> 1:54:42.416
"Limited casualties."

1:54:43.625 --> 1:54:44.750
"Enemy retreating."

1:54:47.708 --> 1:54:49.666
"Troops met with minimal resistance."

1:55:02.958 --> 1:55:04.083
"Beaches held."

1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:20.000
Coming through!

1:55:20.958 --> 1:55:22.041
Out of the way!

1:55:39.125 --> 1:55:41.333
Here's another one,
from Churchill.

1:55:46.750 --> 1:55:48.166
"Mincemeat swallowed."

1:55:50.500 --> 1:55:52.041
"Rod, line, and sinker."

1:56:18.833 --> 1:56:20.083
An ending…

1:56:21.791 --> 1:56:23.666
filled with light.

1:56:41.083 --> 1:56:42.625
We saved some lives today.

1:56:45.791 --> 1:56:47.541
Some lives, not all.

1:56:48.750 --> 1:56:49.833
Can never be all.

1:56:54.541 --> 1:56:56.916
We don't seem to have saved ourselves.

1:56:59.500 --> 1:57:00.916
But those that did make it--

1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:03.083
-Glory will be theirs.
-As it should be.

1:57:08.333 --> 1:57:11.833
We fooled the Fuhrer, murderous bastard.
There's some glory in that.

1:57:15.041 --> 1:57:16.625
My brother has come home.

1:57:18.541 --> 1:57:20.000
We'll bury him tomorrow.

1:57:23.250 --> 1:57:25.583
It was the deal I'd struck with Godfrey

1:57:26.833 --> 1:57:28.750
in exchange for spying on you.

1:57:33.291 --> 1:57:34.625
Then I'd like to be there.

1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:46.416
I need to go home
and finish a letter to my wife.

1:57:53.166 --> 1:57:54.666
But first, I need a drink.

1:57:56.708 --> 1:57:57.916
Let me buy you a drink.

1:58:00.250 --> 1:58:01.458
Eight in the morning.

1:58:02.458 --> 1:58:04.375
Surely someone will take us in.
