this situation yourself.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.558
I was fixing this but then

03:30.645 --> 03:32.081
you were too worried
what people would think.

03:32.168 --> 03:33.300

10:05.082 --> 10:08.085
to make my own decisions,
so I decided to stay in jail

10:08.172 --> 10:09.826
'and I'm not leaving
until she agrees'

10:09.913 --> 10:11.262
'to let me live my own life.'

10:11.349 --> 10:12.786
So it's a war of attrition.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.222
[exhales deeply]
So to speak.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.224
Except she gets to wage
the war from the comfort

10:16.311 --> 10:18.182
of her penthouse
while you remain behind bars.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.619
Look, don't worry about me.

10:19.706 --> 10:22.273
Enjoy prom with Nate
like you always planned

10:22.360 --> 10:24.275
in that scrapbook
that you kept under your bed.

10:24.362 --> 10:28.976
[scoffs]
Please. I don't remember that.
I was a child then.

10:29.063 --> 10:32.370
I should go. I don't want
to abuse my phone privileges.

10:32.457 --> 10:34.503
The fact that you're
on an actual pay phone

10:34.590 --> 10:36.331
has me beyond nauseous.

10:36.418 --> 10:37.898
Stay strong, S.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.640
- What's this for?
- Strength. You will need.

10:40.727 --> 10:44.078
I have good news and bad news.
Which do you want?

10:44.165 --> 10:46.210
Good news first, always.

10:46.297 --> 10:49.213
- There is replacement.
- What are you talking about?

10:49.300 --> 10:51.259
It makes more sense
if you pick bad news first.

10:51.346 --> 10:52.608
Your dress for prom.

10:52.695 --> 10:55.785
The dry cleaners
they ruined it.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.657
This body bag.
Corpse not pretty.

11:00.572 --> 11:03.532
- But there's a replacement.
- Back to good news.

11:03.619 --> 11:06.491
This morning it arrived
from Paris.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.798
Just like in scrapbook.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.017
[gasps]

11:10.104 --> 11:12.019
Oh. It is.

11:12.106 --> 11:15.500
Oh, just like my scrapbook
I don't remember keeping

11:15.587 --> 11:18.373
and haven't looked at
since I was an early adolescent.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.810
Oh, i-it must be from daddy.

11:20.897 --> 11:23.334
Tonight is
going to be magical.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.075
[laughs]

11:25.162 --> 11:27.512
You know, prom hasn't exactly
been going as planned.

11:27.599 --> 11:28.992
The florists lost
Blair's corsage.

11:29.079 --> 11:30.907
Someone bought up
all the peonies

11:30.994 --> 11:32.822
and when I called
to confirm my limo

11:32.909 --> 11:35.390
it had been rented out by
a bachelorette party in Jersey.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.305
[inhales sharply]
The heart quickens.

11:37.392 --> 11:40.134
Yeah, well, my hotel room
was mysteriously cancelled

11:40.221 --> 11:42.832
and now I just found out
Blair's dress has been ruined.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.225
How tragic.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.835
I gotta ask..

11:47.968 --> 11:50.710
Am Isabotaging
your dream prom?

11:52.276 --> 11:54.452
The answer is no,
Nathaniel.

11:54.539 --> 11:55.758
And I don't know
how many times

11:55.845 --> 11:57.107
we need to have
this conversation.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.326
Blair is yours.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.724
Okay.

12:04.811 --> 12:07.465
Oh, what a restorative nap
that was.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.119
I feel so much better.

12:09.206 --> 12:11.992
Well, I'm afraid that moment
is not going to last.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.167
Eric out of earshot?

12:13.254 --> 12:15.343
I sent him to a movie
with Jonathan.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.823
So no one can hear me scream.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.868
You're gonna what, Lily,
hack me to pieces

12:18.955 --> 12:20.261

12:20.348 --> 12:23.090
I am simply
and for the last time

12:23.177 --> 12:26.441
gonna ask you to leave my home
and never come back.

12:26.528 --> 12:29.096
"Never" is a, uh,
very long time, darling.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.533
- You are toxic.
- I'm your mother.

12:31.620 --> 12:34.318
And a memorable one at that,
so much so it seems

12:34.405 --> 12:36.407
that try as I might,
I can't help turning into you.

12:36.494 --> 12:37.713
Well, maybe that's 'cause
you finally are starting

12:37.800 --> 12:39.541
to see the wisdom of my ways.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.848
You blame me for everything.

12:41.935 --> 12:44.720
And you accept responsibility
for nothing.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.330
You know,
maybe Carol's right.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.158
The only way to have a normal
life is without you in it.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.117
Your sister
was rebellious and ungrateful

12:50.204 --> 12:52.075

and look where she ended up.

12:52.162 --> 12:54.730

it doesn't look so bad.

Hi. I'm looking for
my sister Carol. Carol Rhodes.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.279
Uh, I think that
she works here. Is she in?

13:22.366 --> 13:25.761
I'm covering four extra tables
today, so that'd be no.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.937
Flaking on work,
that seems like Carol.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.330
Do you know
where she might be?

13:29.417 --> 13:30.984
Hey! Watch
where you're going, spaz.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.682

all over my Gucci.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.815
Personally, I don't see it.

- The family resemblance.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.299

Wait. You know her?

Yeah.

where she might be?

- Well, you missed a spot.

to live with him

I can't stand my mom, I spent
the last $9 that I had on gas

14:03.668 --> 14:05.801

and I'm homeless

who I basically

14:07.281 --> 14:08.630
haven't talked to
in, like, a year

14:08.717 --> 14:11.285
I'm gonna have
to become...a prostitute.

14:11.372 --> 14:12.764
And I don't even know how
to bea prostitute.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.766
I mean, really,
how much small talk is required?

14:14.854 --> 14:16.943
And, and where do you even go?
And are BJs a must?

14:17.030 --> 14:20.381
Because if that's the case,
I am so not doing that.

that information is relevant

I just met five minutes ago?

Don't want to come,
I'll give her your regards

14:49.497 --> 14:51.716

29:13.055 --> 29:15.144
You know how important
prom is to me.

29:15.231 --> 29:16.711
- Blair, what's wrong?
- I caught him with these.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.191
They're all marked
with Nelly Yuki's name.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.801
He's sabotaging me.

29:19.888 --> 29:23.370
My missing corsage, my dress
the limo and hotel?

29:23.457 --> 29:25.285
[Carol]
'We paid you 500 bucks
to shoot that thing.'

29:25.372 --> 29:28.592
We were friends then.
I was giving you a special rate.

29:28.679 --> 29:30.116
'Our relationship's
changed now.'

29:30.203 --> 29:31.595
You can pay me
the balance in cash

29:31.682 --> 29:35.077
or...I don't know.

29:35.164 --> 29:36.992
What are you doing
Saturday?

29:37.079 --> 29:39.690
Gross. My sister
would never sleep with you.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.562
Yeah, 'cause she's dating me.

29:41.649 --> 29:43.564
Shep, we're not dating.
We were never dating.

29:43.651 --> 29:46.088
'Well, both of you don't know
Carol very well'

29:46.175 --> 29:48.743
'cause, yeah,
she totally slept with me.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.266
[clicks tongue]
Pretty fun, too.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.920
You slept with
your music video director?

29:52.007 --> 29:53.574
I didn't know
he had a girlfriend

29:53.661 --> 29:55.358
and I broke it off
as soon as I found out.

29:55.445 --> 29:56.882
But what he wants
to charge us?

29:56.969 --> 29:58.622
Might as well be
a million bucks.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.407
And I know you probably think
I should ask mom and dad

30:00.494 --> 30:02.888
for the money, but..

30:05.020 --> 30:07.501
Whatever. I'll think
of something. It's fine.

30:07.588 --> 30:10.286
No, Carol. It's not fine.

30:15.509 --> 30:18.773
Hi. I'm Lily Rhodes,
and that's my sister

30:18.860 --> 30:20.383
and no one treats us
this way.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.997
Okay, we already called the cops

30:25.084 --> 30:26.781
so...you guys are trespassing.

30:26.868 --> 30:30.219
It's cool, okay?
We're done here.

30:32.787 --> 30:34.484
Finally.

30:34.571 --> 30:36.835
Take the trash
back to the valley.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.662
[scoffs]
What did you just say?

30:40.055 --> 30:41.709
Don't you have
anything better to do

30:41.796 --> 30:44.277
like get your butt tattooed?

30:44.364 --> 30:46.670
The only tattoo I'm getting
tonight is your face on my fist.

30:46.757 --> 30:49.804
Ladies, come on.
No need to fight over me.

30:49.891 --> 30:52.154
Okay. Okay.

30:52.241 --> 30:53.808
How about we just fight you?

30:53.895 --> 30:54.983
[grunts]

30:55.070 --> 30:56.550
- I got him.
- Lily. Come on.

30:56.637 --> 30:59.118
'Go, go, go. Get 'em.'

30:59.205 --> 31:00.684
Where do you think
you're going?

31:00.771 --> 31:02.556
[Owen grunts]

31:02.643 --> 31:04.819
Carol.

31:04.906 --> 31:07.430
A-ah.

31:07.517 --> 31:10.085
[Owen grunting]

31:14.307 --> 31:15.699
[grunts]

31:15.786 --> 31:17.571
Hey, leave him alone.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.488
Oh-h!

31:21.575 --> 31:24.056
Students, if I could have
your attention, please.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.580
For the first time ever
at Constance

31:26.667 --> 31:31.193
our prom queen is..

31:31.280 --> 31:33.456
I can't believe you're not
even defending yourself.

31:33.543 --> 31:35.981
[Blair]
'Lie to my face.
Blame someone. Something.'

31:36.068 --> 31:38.766
I'm sorry. Just one moment.

31:38.853 --> 31:40.811
- Seriously?
- I know how to count.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.814
'Our prom queen is..'

31:43.902 --> 31:46.252
...Blair Waldorf.

31:46.339 --> 31:47.470
But that's impossible.

31:47.557 --> 31:50.909
Oh, my God. I won.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.259
This is my moment.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.174
I own prom.

31:55.261 --> 31:56.827
[Penelope]
'And our king'

31:56.915 --> 31:58.438
'Nate Archibald.'

32:01.093 --> 32:04.400
Oh, my gosh.
This is so great.

32:04.487 --> 32:06.098
[gasps]
Thank you.

32:06.185 --> 32:09.231
Oh. Thanks.

32:09.318 --> 32:11.146
Thank you, everyone.

32:11.233 --> 32:13.366
Oh, I can't believe Blair won.

32:13.453 --> 32:17.283
- Yeah, who even voted for her?
- Me. About 150 times.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.372
I wasn't putting
the Nelly Yuki ballots in.

32:19.459 --> 32:21.026
I was taking them out.

32:21.113 --> 32:22.810
'But what about what she said
you did to her limo'

32:22.897 --> 32:24.507
and hotel and her corsage?

32:24.594 --> 32:26.466
Her new dress looks better
without it.

32:28.468 --> 32:31.123
Give this to her.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.038
It's to the penthouse
at The Plaza.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.300
'You didn't think
you were the only one'

32:34.387 --> 32:37.303
who knew about
the scrapbook, did you?

32:39.435 --> 32:41.611
Chuck, I..

32:41.698 --> 32:44.353
...I can't believe
I'm saying this, but..

32:44.440 --> 32:46.181
...that was really sweet.

32:46.268 --> 32:48.357
I just wanted to make sure
she had the perfect night.

32:48.444 --> 32:51.012
[man #2]
'Your 2009 king and queen.'

32:51.099 --> 32:53.449
[female narrator]
Aw, who knew the mother-chucker

32:53.536 --> 32:55.886
could also play
fairy godmother?

32:55.974 --> 32:59.281
But if C Just made
B's dreams come true

32:59.368 --> 33:00.935
why does it feel
like our queen

33:01.022 --> 33:02.850
is standing
with the wrong king?

33:06.419 --> 33:07.289
You can't use the one
you already have on file?

33:07.376 --> 33:08.551
[shutter snaps]

33:10.379 --> 33:12.512
Wait. Let me
at least fix my makeup.

33:12.599 --> 33:14.862
[shutter snaps]

33:17.560 --> 33:20.041
[woman #2]
'Are you ready
to do the workout?'

33:20.128 --> 33:22.087
'Beginner's workout. Stand with
your feet a little more..'

33:22.174 --> 33:23.827
Jail?

33:23.914 --> 33:26.308
You're in jail?

33:26.395 --> 33:28.702
I know, mom.
I'm-I'm sorry.

33:28.789 --> 33:30.878
You know, if I was a better
mother, I'd leave you in there

33:30.965 --> 33:32.575
teach you a lesson,
you ran away.

33:32.662 --> 33:34.360
You just abandoned me
at the side of the road.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.492
You know they only give you
one phone call, right?

33:36.579 --> 33:39.582
Oh, Lily, the hopes and dreams
I have for you

33:39.669 --> 33:42.585
an Ivy league education,
life on the upper east side

33:42.672 --> 33:45.762
married to the richest man
in Manhattan.

33:45.849 --> 33:47.677
See, that's the thing, mom.

33:47.764 --> 33:51.203
Those are your hopes
and your dreams, not mine.

33:51.290 --> 33:53.944
I need to figure out
what I want, what I need.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.599
Like a parole officer?
I'm getting in the car.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.688
You need to be far away
from your sister's influence.

33:58.775 --> 34:03.389
Why? What's wrong with Carol?
The fact that she's independent?

34:03.476 --> 34:06.392
That she thinks for herself,
that she does what she wants

34:06.479 --> 34:08.089
and not what other people
tell her to do?

34:08.176 --> 34:09.917
How about your spare me
the heartache

34:10.004 --> 34:11.701
and yourself the humiliation

34:11.788 --> 34:16.097
'and give up on this failed
experiment in rebellion?'

34:16.184 --> 34:18.447
What if this is not
an experiment?

34:18.534 --> 34:21.276
What about if this
is me growing up?

34:23.452 --> 34:25.324
Enough soul searching. I'm
calling your father's lawyer.

34:25.411 --> 34:27.021
We need to keep this thing
out of the papers.

34:27.108 --> 34:30.546
[crying]
Please, mom,
I don't need a publicist.

34:30.633 --> 34:32.200
I need my mother.

34:32.287 --> 34:36.074
I'm trying to talk to you here,
and you're not..

34:36.161 --> 34:37.423
Hey, mom. Got a sec?

34:40.252 --> 34:41.166
Carol.

34:43.255 --> 34:44.734
This is your chance

34:44.821 --> 34:46.606
to be a big sister

34:46.693 --> 34:51.045
'and finally offer some actual
guidance to Lily, advice.'

34:51.132 --> 34:52.481
Her future's at stake.

34:52.568 --> 34:55.180
Which is why she needs
to be far away from you.

34:55.267 --> 34:57.138
This is how it's
going to be, mom.

34:57.225 --> 34:58.487
Lily's staying with me
for a while.

34:58.574 --> 35:00.141
'Carol, just be reasonable.'

35:00.228 --> 35:01.447
'We both know the first time'

35:01.534 --> 35:04.058
'that she breaks a nail,
rides a city bus'

35:04.145 --> 35:06.974
or God forbid actually steps
foot in a public school

35:07.061 --> 35:08.671
'she'll come running home.'

35:08.758 --> 35:10.325
Well, that's really up to Lily,
now isn't it?

35:10.412 --> 35:12.675
Just tell her to-to sit tight.
I'm coming for her.

35:12.762 --> 35:15.417
No, mom. You sit tight.
She'll call you later.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.305
Oh, goodness.

35:33.392 --> 35:35.872
Mother. Mom.

35:35.959 --> 35:37.918
Don't tell me you're
chasing me out of town.

35:38.005 --> 35:40.138
I'm fleeing as fast as I can.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.705
Well, please stop
I'm not going to apologize

35:42.792 --> 35:44.751
but I love you,
and I know you love me.

35:44.838 --> 35:46.056
Well, of course I love you

35:46.144 --> 35:47.884
my daughters,
my grandchildren.

35:47.971 --> 35:50.191
- My only motivation is love.
- On the contrary.

35:50.278 --> 35:53.194
Your motives are quite suspect,
selfish even.

35:53.281 --> 35:55.196
And you haven't always done
what's best for me.

35:55.283 --> 35:56.763
Well, I've done
the very best I could.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.808
You think Serena's a handful?

35:58.895 --> 36:01.768
I would rather have
20 Dan Humphreys from Brooklyn

36:01.855 --> 36:04.205
instead of that boy you loved
from the Valley.

36:06.990 --> 36:08.644
Well, you took care of that,
didn't you?

36:08.731 --> 36:12.605
And you ended up with Serena and
Eric and the life you deserve.

36:12.692 --> 36:15.042
It wasn't up to you to decide
what kind of life I should have.

36:15.129 --> 36:16.652
What else does it mean
to be a mother

36:16.739 --> 36:20.134
than to make sure that your
child fulfills her destiny?

36:20.221 --> 36:23.093
Well, I wanted to create
my own destiny.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.270
But that would have meant
losing you

36:25.357 --> 36:27.446
and I was always too afraid
to do that.

36:27.533 --> 36:29.926
Until this afternoon,
evidently.

36:30.013 --> 36:32.886
[sighs]
Mother, please,
I'm just asking you to stay.

36:32.973 --> 36:34.975
You know, being a mother myself,
I've made mistakes

36:35.062 --> 36:37.934
that rival
if not outshine your own.

36:38.021 --> 36:40.067
And I forgive you.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.462
Lucky me.

36:43.549 --> 36:46.247
You throw me out of your home,
and I get forgiven.

36:46.334 --> 36:49.903
Mother, just say thank you
and give me a hug.

36:49.990 --> 36:51.165
I most certainly
am not gonna thank you

36:51.252 --> 36:52.645
for the terrible things
you said.

36:52.732 --> 36:55.213
And as far as the hug goes,
well, you've always done

36:55.300 --> 36:57.215
exactly as you pleased,
haven't you?

37:15.798 --> 37:18.148
[Fountain of Wayne singing
"Prom Theme"]

37:21.717 --> 37:24.111
Hey. You okay?

37:24.198 --> 37:26.461
This is supposed to be
the happiest day in high school.

37:28.681 --> 37:31.074
So why do I feel so sad?

37:32.815 --> 37:35.253
Like something's ending?

37:35.340 --> 37:38.299
Well, something
is ending, high school.

37:38.386 --> 37:40.301
Not just school.

37:46.438 --> 37:47.613
You're my first love.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.487
[sighs]
Going to my senior prom with you

37:52.574 --> 37:55.882
is something I've wanted
since I was 12 years old.

37:55.969 --> 37:57.013
And here we are

37:57.100 --> 37:59.407
like it was meant to be.

37:59.494 --> 38:02.280
Yes. This was supposed
to happen.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.064
I'm sure of it.

38:05.979 --> 38:08.242
But now it has and--

38:08.329 --> 38:11.898
Why are you talking
in the past tense?

38:11.985 --> 38:15.510
- We're still here.
- I know.

38:15.597 --> 38:18.600
But this night already
feels like a memory.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.865
[sighs]

38:22.952 --> 38:26.042
Just hold me..

38:26.129 --> 38:28.480
...until the song's over.

moments talking about it.

There you are.

39:25.014 --> 39:27.582
Where's the prom king?

39:27.669 --> 39:30.368
- We broke up.
- What?

39:30.455 --> 39:32.500
But-but everything was
so perfect.

39:32.587 --> 39:34.937
It w-was like
a fairy tale.

39:35.024 --> 39:39.551
It turns out fairy tales
end when they do for a reason.

39:39.638 --> 39:42.641
I really wanted to go to prom
with my high school boyfriend.

39:44.556 --> 39:47.297
And...now that I have--

39:47.385 --> 39:49.952
He feels like
your high school boyfriend.

39:52.738 --> 39:55.393
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

39:56.916 --> 39:58.134
That you almost missed prom

39:58.221 --> 40:00.136
because your mother
had you arrested

40:00.223 --> 40:03.009
and your quasi
half-brother/ex-boyfriend

40:03.096 --> 40:04.924
was your prom date.

40:05.011 --> 40:08.449
[laughs]
You know, I actually
had a lot of fun tonight.

40:08.536 --> 40:11.496
Dan and I made up, and I know
that whatever my mother did

40:11.583 --> 40:14.586
she-she did out of love.

40:14.673 --> 40:17.980
And right now, I am with exactly
who I want to be with..

40:18.067 --> 40:19.286
...my best friend.

40:19.373 --> 40:21.244
So, thank you.

40:21.331 --> 40:22.507
Well, it's the least I can do

40:22.594 --> 40:25.118
since I got you arrested
and everything.

40:25.205 --> 40:26.902
I didn't know
you were such a brawler.

40:26.989 --> 40:28.730
Neither did I.

40:28.817 --> 40:31.167
I learned some things
last night..

40:31.254 --> 40:34.606
...the biggest one being..

40:34.693 --> 40:36.085
...that I've really missed you.

40:36.172 --> 40:38.305
You are high school to me.

40:38.392 --> 40:39.915
All of the boyfriends

40:40.002 --> 40:43.005
and mean girls and,
and tests and teachers

40:43.092 --> 40:46.226
and our crazy mothers.

40:46.313 --> 40:48.184
We-we went through it
together.

40:48.271 --> 40:49.925
We raised each other.

40:51.927 --> 40:53.189
You're my sister.

40:53.276 --> 40:54.974
[chuckles]

40:55.061 --> 40:56.541
So where's your car?

40:56.628 --> 40:58.891
How do you think
I got you out of here?

40:58.978 --> 41:01.676
You sold your car?

41:01.763 --> 41:04.374
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna walk?

41:04.462 --> 41:06.376
Walking in LA? Wow, sis.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.814
I have so much more
to teach you. Come on.

41:08.901 --> 41:12.121
It's us. We travel in style
no matter how we travel.

Shoulder pads may come and go,
but a BFF is forever

41:34.448 --> 41:37.277
because even when you're not
sure where you're headed

41:37.364 --> 41:40.541
it helps to know
you're not going there alone.

41:42.978 --> 41:45.111
No one has all the answers

41:45.198 --> 41:48.810
and sometimes the best
we can do is just apologize

41:48.897 --> 41:51.160
and let the past be the past.

41:53.946 --> 41:56.731
Other times,
we need to look to the future

41:56.818 --> 41:59.647
and know that even when
we think we've seen it all

41:59.734 --> 42:01.606
life can still surprise us

42:01.693 --> 42:04.696
and we can still
surprise ourselves.
