<i>Previously on</i>SWAT...How much do you actually

00:03.340 --> 00:06.180
know about Powell?Not a ton.
She plays it pretty close.

00:06.380 --> 00:07.400
You remember what it was
like to be the problem child

00:07.600 --> 00:08.710
on 20-Squad.

00:08.910 --> 00:10.320
Look, I heard she
had some problems,

00:10.520 --> 00:11.750
but from what I've seen today,
she's doing great.

00:11.950 --> 00:13.190
TAN:
<i>Bonnie and I are over.</i>

00:13.390 --> 00:14.800
Over? What happened?She cheated on me.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.590
Who is he?I met him through work.

00:16.790 --> 00:19.280
Are you in love with him?I'm sorry.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.150
Get out.
Just get the hell out.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.680
Luca, come on, man,
move your ass.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.030
We're gonna be late.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.690
Yeah, if someone
didn't spend five hours

00:30.890 --> 00:31.690
in the bathroom every morning
fixing their hair.

00:31.890 --> 00:33.730
[phone vibrates][scoffs]

00:33.930 --> 00:35.870
Who's texting you this early?

00:36.070 --> 00:37.480
Chris. She's sending me pictures

00:37.680 --> 00:38.960
of an apartment for rent.

00:39.160 --> 00:40.780
What, she's moving out
of the safe house?

00:40.980 --> 00:42.090
Yeah, now that she's
raised some funding

00:42.290 --> 00:44.400
and got the volunteers
helping out,

00:44.600 --> 00:45.920
she figured it's time

00:46.120 --> 00:47.400
to strike a little
work/life balance.

00:47.600 --> 00:48.400
Ah, sweet.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.790
Yeah.

00:49.990 --> 00:53.010
Actually, she's signing
the lease today.

00:53.210 --> 00:54.190
Cool.

00:54.390 --> 00:56.400
And I'm gonna co-sign.

00:57.490 --> 00:58.800
You're moving in with her?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.070
Yeah.[chuckles]

01:01.260 --> 01:03.110
I'm sorry, It's not that
I don't love living here, I...

01:03.310 --> 01:04.850
You're the best
roommate I've ever had.

01:05.050 --> 01:06.240
Even though you drink
all my protein shakes.

01:06.440 --> 01:07.810
But just think,

01:08.010 --> 01:09.380
now you won't have to
line up for the bathroom.

01:09.580 --> 01:11.380
Yeah and I won't have
to wear earplugs.

01:11.580 --> 01:13.950
Right. Why are you
wearing earplugs?

01:14.150 --> 01:15.430
The walls are paper thin, dude.

01:15.630 --> 01:17.560
Look... [laughs]
It's totally cool.

01:17.760 --> 01:18.950
I knew this day
would come. In fact,

01:19.150 --> 01:20.210
I already started thinking about

01:20.410 --> 01:21.560
what I'm gonna
use your room for.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.390
You're not gonna rent it out?

01:23.590 --> 01:25.130
Nah, I've been thinking about
turning it into a man cave.

01:25.330 --> 01:27.440
Gonna have a poker table,
bar in the corner.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.050
I saw thisawesome

01:29.250 --> 01:31.490
Donkey Kong
arcade game on eBay...

01:31.690 --> 01:33.050
Luca, take a look around.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.660
Any more man cave,
the natural history museum's

01:35.860 --> 01:37.670
gonna be calling asking for
their Neanderthal exhibit back.

01:37.870 --> 01:39.440
Yeah, you might have a point.
You got any better ideas?

01:46.490 --> 01:49.940
Lots of natural light,
great location.

01:50.140 --> 01:52.250
It's a seller's market
in L.A. right now.

01:52.450 --> 01:53.940
Priced right, this place

01:54.140 --> 01:56.290
is gonna be snapped up.Great.

01:56.490 --> 02:00.300
Are you looking to move
somewhere with better schools?

02:00.500 --> 02:01.820
I see a lot of young
couples trying to

02:02.020 --> 02:03.210
get a head start by
moving out to Pasadena

02:03.410 --> 02:04.870
or the Valley.

02:05.070 --> 02:06.000
Not exactly.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.740
We're getting a divorce.

02:07.940 --> 02:12.270
Oh. Well, here's my card.

02:12.470 --> 02:14.180
Call me,

02:14.380 --> 02:15.530
and we'll get the ball rolling.

02:15.730 --> 02:17.000
I can have it
listed within a day.

02:18.700 --> 02:19.790
Bye.

02:25.180 --> 02:27.110
I guess we're really doing this.

02:27.310 --> 02:29.320
Yeah, guess we are.

02:31.670 --> 02:33.510
Remember when we moved in,

02:33.700 --> 02:35.810
the bedroom walls
were painted bright red?

02:36.010 --> 02:38.250
You said it was like sleeping
in the middle of a crime scene.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.890
Of course I do. It took
five coats to paint over it.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.380
And there was that
hook in the ceiling.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.690
We could never figure out

02:45.890 --> 02:47.430
what the previous
owners used it for.

02:47.630 --> 02:49.160
Probably for the best.

02:53.820 --> 02:55.270
We don't have to sell.

02:55.470 --> 02:57.140
I can't afford to buy you out.

02:57.340 --> 02:59.490
What if you didn't have to?

02:59.690 --> 03:01.580
What are you saying?

03:01.780 --> 03:03.800
Maybe we're rushing into things.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.490
Selling
this place,

03:05.690 --> 03:07.150
talking about a divorce.

03:07.350 --> 03:08.410
That's what you wanted.

03:08.610 --> 03:09.540
I know.

03:09.740 --> 03:12.060
What if we're making a mistake?

03:14.360 --> 03:15.930
He broke up with you, didn't he?

03:17.710 --> 03:19.590
He go back to his wife?

03:20.590 --> 03:24.470
[scoffs] Sorry,
that's got to suck,

03:24.670 --> 03:27.560
throwing everything away
for a guy who then dumps you,

03:27.760 --> 03:30.610
but if you think that means
you can come running back to me

03:30.810 --> 03:31.910
and I'll greet you
with open arms...

03:32.110 --> 03:33.220
I don't expect
you to forgive me.

03:33.420 --> 03:36.090
But, I guess I'm wondering

03:36.290 --> 03:39.080
if you'd be open to trying?

03:40.650 --> 03:42.180
If he hadn't gone
back to his wife,

03:42.380 --> 03:44.100
would you still be asking?

03:44.300 --> 03:47.000
Or would you be house hunting
with him in Pasadena right now?

03:50.310 --> 03:52.980
What happened was the
biggest mistake of my life,

03:53.180 --> 03:55.010
and I'm so sorry.

03:56.060 --> 03:58.160
You broke my heart, Bonnie.

03:58.350 --> 04:00.240
And I will do whatever
it takes to make it up to you.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.500
I love you.

04:03.590 --> 04:07.150
Just, please, think about it.

All right, listen up.

05:09.340 --> 05:10.970
When the first units got here,
they spotted the suspect

05:11.170 --> 05:12.270
drawing the curtains,
gun in clear sight.

05:12.470 --> 05:13.880
He hasn't responded
to any contact.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.280
According to
his vehicle registration,

05:15.480 --> 05:16.710
his name is Jamie Wilson.

05:16.910 --> 05:18.540
POWELL:
Looks like he's got a family.

05:18.740 --> 05:20.850
Neighbor says he's
got a wife and two kids.

05:21.050 --> 05:22.280
Wife's car is
still in the driveway.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.680
Apparently, that's not normal.
Usually she's left

05:23.870 --> 05:25.370
to take the kids
to school by now.

05:25.570 --> 05:26.680
Look, if the family's
still in there,

05:26.880 --> 05:28.200
they still could be
in danger, okay?

05:28.400 --> 05:29.680

right state of mind.

All right, you two post up

05:38.890 --> 05:40.390

makes a run for it.

I need you
to come to the front door.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.370
but the doctors say
he's going to make it.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.760
Can you tell me if your family

06:03.960 --> 06:04.930
are inside
the house with you, Jamie?

06:05.130 --> 06:06.410
Are they okay?

to kill them.

Where's your family?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.240
Jamie, talk to me.

06:56.670 --> 06:58.860
Not here. They took them.

06:59.060 --> 07:00.160
Who took them?

07:00.360 --> 07:01.640
A man
and a woman.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.990
They said I had
24 hours to kill him.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.390
If I didn't do it,

07:05.590 --> 07:07.470
they said they would
kill my family.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.960
Now they're gonna die,
and it's all my fault.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.000

Last night.

07:17.550 --> 07:18.620
Hey, hey, listen to me.

07:18.820 --> 07:19.830
Then we still have time, Jamie.

07:20.030 --> 07:21.580
Work with us. Who took them?

07:21.780 --> 07:22.580
Do you know?

07:22.780 --> 07:24.400
I told you, it's too late.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.490
No, stop. Stop.
Put that gun down.

07:26.690 --> 07:27.790
Don't do
this, Jamie.

07:28.620 --> 07:29.670
Put that gun down.

07:29.870 --> 07:32.400
Jamie.
Put it down.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.600
Where's his family?

07:47.800 --> 07:49.550
That's a good question.

07:50.810 --> 07:54.380
♪

08:29.680 --> 08:30.380
HICKS: I just heard
from the hospital.

08:30.580 --> 08:31.860
Jamie Wilson's
in surgery.

08:32.060 --> 08:33.950
Bullet missed his heart,
but it's touch and go.

08:34.150 --> 08:35.560
What do we
know so far?

08:35.760 --> 08:36.650
Wilson's wife Julie
and his kids were kidnapped

08:36.850 --> 08:38.480
around 10:00 p.m. last night.

08:38.680 --> 08:40.740
Patrol found a witness that
corroborates Wilson's story.

08:40.940 --> 08:42.220
Yeah, neighbor
was walking his dog,

08:42.420 --> 08:43.660
and he saw a van
in Wilson's driveway

08:43.860 --> 08:45.310
with two people getting out,
but it was dark,

08:45.510 --> 08:46.970
so he didn't get a good look
at them or the van.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.750
Wilson was told he's got
24 hours to carry out the hit,

08:48.950 --> 08:50.450
so we've roughly got
12 hours left

08:50.650 --> 08:53.150
to find his family.
What do we know about Wilson?

08:53.340 --> 08:55.230
Works as a prison guard
at L.A. County Women's Prison.

08:55.430 --> 08:56.580
The kidnappers
ordered him

08:56.780 --> 08:57.580
to kill this man,

08:57.780 --> 08:59.670
Eric Hoffman.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.330
41, single, and get this:

09:01.530 --> 09:03.020
he's another prison guard.
He's Wilson's supervisor.

09:03.220 --> 09:05.460
Wilson said one of the
kidnappers was a woman, right?

09:05.660 --> 09:07.120
I wonder if
it's an ex-con

09:07.320 --> 09:08.730
with a beef against the pair.

09:08.930 --> 09:11.730
I went undercover in
that prison four years ago.

09:11.930 --> 09:12.990
A guard had been
killed by an inmate.

09:13.190 --> 09:14.340
They wanted me to
find out who did it.

09:14.540 --> 09:15.780
All I can say is

09:15.980 --> 09:17.430
some of the women
in that prison,

09:17.630 --> 09:18.950
they could give Hannibal
Lecter a run for his money,

09:19.150 --> 09:20.520
and I don't
scare easy.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.870
Why didn't the suspects
kill Hoffman themselves?

09:23.070 --> 09:24.310
I mean, why kidnap
Wilson's wife and kids

09:24.510 --> 09:25.920
and force him
to do it?

09:26.120 --> 09:27.310
Seems like they wanted Wilson
to pay for something, too.

09:27.510 --> 09:28.660
LUCA: Yeah, like maybe
the two were up to

09:28.860 --> 09:30.230
something shady
inside that prison.

09:30.430 --> 09:31.920
Hoffman's in a bad way
from the hit-and-run,

09:32.120 --> 09:33.970
so it's unlikely he's
waking up any time soon,

09:34.170 --> 09:35.580
and if he does, I'm sure
he's not gonna be

09:35.780 --> 09:36.840
in a state to tell us.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.360
RHD are canvassing
the neighborhood

09:38.560 --> 09:39.930
to see if anybody spotted
the kidnappers' vehicle.

09:40.130 --> 09:41.590
And we got Wilson's phone,
so if the kidnappers

09:41.780 --> 09:43.330
try to make contact,
we can try to run a trace.

09:43.530 --> 09:45.110
All right, Luca, why don't
you start compiling a list

09:45.310 --> 09:46.460
of recently
released prisoners.

09:46.660 --> 09:47.630
On it.

09:47.830 --> 09:49.380
Yes, I found her.

09:49.570 --> 09:50.720

09:50.920 --> 09:51.860
from when
I was undercover.

09:52.060 --> 09:53.340
She's still inside.

09:53.540 --> 09:54.820
She was the unofficial
prison beautician,

09:55.020 --> 09:56.430
had her nose
in all the gossip.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.990
I could go interview her.

09:58.190 --> 09:59.470
If anyone knows
who had it in

09:59.670 --> 10:01.390
for those guards,
it would be Nisi.

10:01.590 --> 10:02.520
She know you're a cop?Yeah.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.000
My cover got blown

10:04.200 --> 10:05.430
as soon as I ID'd
the killer. Wasn't fun.

10:05.630 --> 10:06.870
You think she'll talk to you?

10:07.070 --> 10:08.440
I don't know.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.790
Well, we got a family in danger,

10:09.990 --> 10:10.880
and time's running out
to save them,

10:11.070 --> 10:11.920
so give it your best shot.

10:12.120 --> 10:12.880
I'll get ahold of the warden

10:13.080 --> 10:14.360
and get you permission.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.180
All right, Powell,
you take Street with you.

10:16.380 --> 10:17.580
You talk to the guards on duty,
find out whatever you can

10:17.780 --> 10:19.530
about Hoffman and Wilson.Okay.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.200
Powell wasn't wrong
about this prison.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.150
Over 2,000 inmates.

10:29.350 --> 10:30.940
Lot of them in
for violent crimes.

10:31.140 --> 10:33.410
Hundreds released each month.
Gonna be here for a while.

10:35.190 --> 10:36.810
Hey, end of an era, huh?
Street moving out?

10:37.010 --> 10:38.600
Yeah, trying to look
on the bright side.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.080
Gonna have a spare
room, you know?

10:40.280 --> 10:41.860
I'm toying with ideas
what to use it for.

10:42.060 --> 10:43.210
Bonnie turned our guest room

10:43.410 --> 10:44.560
into a yoga
and meditation space.

10:44.760 --> 10:46.080
[scoffs] Dude,
I tried meditating.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.560
I couldn't manage
for five seconds.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.740
My mind can't
sit still that long.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.220
Surfing's the only
meditation I need.

10:51.420 --> 10:54.130
Yeah, I hear you. My vote was
for a TV room, but Bonnie won.

10:55.690 --> 10:57.570
And, you know, I
actually kind of got into it.

10:57.770 --> 10:59.360
Sunday mornings,
we'd do a little Ashtanga,

10:59.560 --> 11:01.100
then a little meditation.

11:01.300 --> 11:02.800
Then go out
for avocado toast

11:03.000 --> 11:05.230
and oat milk
vanilla lattes

11:05.430 --> 11:06.450
and tick those
L.A. clichés

11:06.650 --> 11:07.930
off your to-do
list as well?

11:08.130 --> 11:09.660
Ha. There's nothing wrong
with avocado toast.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.290
Sunday mornings
are what I miss most.

11:13.480 --> 11:14.770
I'm sorry.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.030
It's okay.

11:17.230 --> 11:20.290
Bonnie actually kind of
surprised me this morning.

11:20.490 --> 11:22.210
She wants to get back together.

11:22.410 --> 11:24.860
For real? What did you say?

11:25.060 --> 11:27.910
Nothing. I mean,
I wasn't expecting it.

11:28.110 --> 11:31.040
And not sure what
to think, but I miss her.

11:31.240 --> 11:32.650
Seeing her again made me wonder.

11:32.850 --> 11:34.390
POWELL:
You're joking, right?

11:34.590 --> 11:36.400
You'd be an idiot
if you took her back.

11:36.590 --> 11:37.700
I'm... sorry, Tan,

11:37.900 --> 11:39.660
just speaking from experience.

11:39.860 --> 11:41.750
Took my husband back after
I caught him cheating.

11:41.950 --> 11:43.100
He swore it was a one-off.

11:43.300 --> 11:44.450
Turns out, he's a liar

11:44.650 --> 11:45.230
who couldn't
keep it in his pants.

11:45.430 --> 11:46.580
Don't you have

11:46.780 --> 11:48.410
some place,
like a prison, to be?

11:48.610 --> 11:51.620
Nope. Still waiting on Hicks
to hear back from the warden.

11:59.370 --> 12:00.720
HONDO:
Hey, Commander.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.080
Any more news on Wilson?

12:04.270 --> 12:05.730
He gonna
pull through?

12:05.930 --> 12:08.510
[sighs] Seems like it.
I thought you'd be relieved.

12:08.710 --> 12:10.300
I am. I'm just angry

12:10.500 --> 12:12.000
that I got put in that
position to begin with.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.350
I get it.

12:14.550 --> 12:17.780
I was on the end of a suicide
by cop attempt myself once.

12:18.820 --> 12:20.610
Really?
What happened?

12:20.810 --> 12:24.010
Well, this guy's family had been
killed in a car accident,

12:24.210 --> 12:25.920
and he didn't want to
go on without them,

12:26.120 --> 12:28.360
but he couldn't
pull the trigger.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.400
Was a good
Catholic boy,

12:29.600 --> 12:30.880
he didn't want
to go to hell.

12:31.080 --> 12:34.930
So he turned the gun
on me, and I shot him.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.540
Did he die?Mm-hmm.

12:37.740 --> 12:39.330
It was my first time
pulling the trigger with intent.

12:39.530 --> 12:42.810
I didn't have the wherewithal
to fire wide, like you.

12:43.010 --> 12:44.680
But I know

12:44.880 --> 12:46.200
you wouldn't have
missed at that range,

12:46.400 --> 12:48.290
not without meaning to.

12:48.490 --> 12:50.380
I wasn't gonna help him kill
himself, if I could help it.

12:50.580 --> 12:52.120
But what I don't get is how
he could give up like that.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.080
If that was me,
there's nothing I wouldn't do

12:54.280 --> 12:55.340
to try to save
Nichelle and my baby.

12:55.540 --> 12:56.560
Don't be so quick to judge.

12:56.760 --> 12:57.870
His fight or
flight response

12:58.070 --> 13:01.740
kicked in and he panicked.

13:01.940 --> 13:04.220
Most people are not
born heroes, Hondo.

13:04.420 --> 13:05.790
Sometimes it takes training.

13:05.990 --> 13:08.270
Sir, I'm not sure I feel
like cutting him a break.

13:08.470 --> 13:09.970
We might not know
why he was targeted,

13:10.170 --> 13:12.140
but I'm guessing it wasn't
because he and Hoffman

13:12.340 --> 13:14.580
were handing out free candy
in the prison commissary.

13:14.780 --> 13:16.180
[phone vibrates]

13:20.140 --> 13:21.980
Hey, Powell,

13:22.180 --> 13:24.550
I couldn't get ahold
of the warden.

13:24.750 --> 13:25.550
He's at his son's
wedding in Italy.

13:25.750 --> 13:26.810
But I did manage to speak

13:27.010 --> 13:28.770
to a friend at
Department of Corrections.

13:28.970 --> 13:31.120
It's all squared away for you
to interview your old cellmate,

13:31.320 --> 13:32.210
so hop to it.I'll grab Street

13:32.410 --> 13:33.340
and head
over there.

13:33.540 --> 13:34.380
Any progress on our suspects?

13:34.580 --> 13:35.820
640 prisoners have been released

13:36.020 --> 13:36.990
over the last six months.[phone vibrates]

13:37.190 --> 13:38.260
Trying to
narrow it down,

13:38.460 --> 13:39.650
but there's not a lot to go on.

13:39.850 --> 13:40.650
And we're not even
sure our kidnapper

13:40.850 --> 13:41.610
is even a former prisoner.

13:41.810 --> 13:43.300
It's RHD.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.050
Delivery driver in Wilson's
neighborhood last night

13:45.250 --> 13:46.130
caught the white Sprinter van

13:46.330 --> 13:47.570
on their
dash cam.

13:47.770 --> 13:49.180
It was dark, so all
he could make out

13:49.380 --> 13:50.920
is that the license plate
began with the letter "N."

13:51.120 --> 13:52.440
There are thousands
of those vans.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.490
It might not even be
registered in California.

13:54.690 --> 13:55.930
Looks like Street and Powell
are our only hope

13:56.130 --> 13:58.180
of catching a break
in this damn case.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.330
What was your
cellmate in for?

14:09.530 --> 14:10.850
She killed her boyfriend.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.380
Stabbed him in the neck
with nail scissors.

14:12.580 --> 14:15.160
Geez. What he do
to deserve that?

14:15.360 --> 14:17.160
He beat her one
too many times.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.170
Check it out.
Luca texted

14:19.370 --> 14:20.860
that the kidnappers
used a white van.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.520
It's not that one, but
all visitors and staff

14:22.720 --> 14:24.080
probably
have to sign in

14:24.280 --> 14:25.560
and include their
vehicle details.

14:25.760 --> 14:26.960
We could take a look
at the visitors log.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.650
It's a long shot,
but you never know.

14:32.650 --> 14:34.830
Work here long,
Officer Fisk?

14:35.030 --> 14:36.840
It's Janice.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.620
And no,
just a month.

14:38.820 --> 14:39.840
How you liking it?

14:40.040 --> 14:41.190
It's challenging,

14:41.390 --> 14:42.930
but that's what I signed up for.

14:43.130 --> 14:44.800
I want to
join LAPD,

14:45.000 --> 14:46.280
but it's
pretty competitive.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.020
Figured this would
give me an edge.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.850
Hey, you mind if we take a look
through this visitor log?

14:51.050 --> 14:53.850
I'm sorry,
it's against the rules.

14:54.050 --> 14:56.290
A little peek, that's all.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.080
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm new,

14:58.270 --> 14:59.500
and I don't want to
get in any trouble.

15:00.980 --> 15:02.380
[door buzzes]

15:02.580 --> 15:03.990
STREET:
Hey, uh,

15:04.190 --> 15:05.950
you happen to know
a guy named Hoffman?

15:06.150 --> 15:08.210
Guard here. He's an
old buddy of mine.

15:09.250 --> 15:10.700
No.

15:10.900 --> 15:12.000
I mean, I know of him,

15:12.200 --> 15:15.210
but I work a different pod.
This way.

15:18.260 --> 15:19.520
[door buzzes]

15:26.880 --> 15:28.450
How you been, Nisi?

15:28.650 --> 15:30.970
Four years late
with that question.

15:32.100 --> 15:34.070
I'm sorry.

15:34.270 --> 15:36.420
You listen to me, Sandra...

15:36.620 --> 15:39.420
Oh. Oh, I forgot,
that ain't your name.

15:39.620 --> 15:41.210
I vouched
for you.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.380
I told everyone
you were cool,

15:42.580 --> 15:43.690
then I find out

15:43.890 --> 15:44.820
you ain't no drug dealer.
You a cop.

15:45.020 --> 15:46.080
You know what
that made me

15:46.280 --> 15:47.820
look like,
being your bunkie?

15:48.020 --> 15:49.040
A snitch.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.130
Everyone thought
it was me

15:50.330 --> 15:51.690
who ratted out Angie

15:51.890 --> 15:53.300
for killing
that guard.It was you.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.520
Oh, didn't know you
were a cop though, did I?

15:55.720 --> 15:58.820
I thought I was just letting
my friend in on the gossip.

15:59.820 --> 16:01.350
I'm sorry.

16:02.910 --> 16:04.580
Added money to
your prepay account.

16:04.780 --> 16:06.930
I know how much you
like to call your kids.

16:07.130 --> 16:09.840
How they doing? How's Lily?

16:10.040 --> 16:11.670
She graduate
high school yet?

16:11.870 --> 16:13.720
Yeah, she's
at community college.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.100
How's your kid?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.970
Do you even have a kid?

16:20.580 --> 16:22.540
[scoffs] Anything
you told me true?

16:23.540 --> 16:25.200
What are you even doing here?

16:26.280 --> 16:27.210
We need your help.

16:27.410 --> 16:28.820
There are two guards

16:29.020 --> 16:30.520
working here,
Hoffman and Wilson.

16:30.710 --> 16:32.390
We think an ex-prisoner
might have beef with them.

16:32.590 --> 16:34.950
What happened, they finally
get what was coming to them?

16:35.150 --> 16:36.990
What do you mean by that?

16:38.560 --> 16:40.560
Listen, if you know something,
you got to tell us.

16:42.780 --> 16:44.490
Considering how that
worked out for me last time,

16:44.690 --> 16:45.920
I don't think so.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.620
Please, Nisi. I know
I'm asking a lot,

16:48.820 --> 16:50.320
but there are
kids' lives at stake.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.010
We really need your help.

16:53.050 --> 16:54.050
Guard!

16:55.100 --> 16:56.490
[door buzzes]

16:57.750 --> 16:59.020
GUARD:
Let's go.

16:59.220 --> 17:02.020
Don't come back, Sandra.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.030
POWELL:
That was a waste of time.

17:09.230 --> 17:10.640
And Goody Two-shoes Janice
wouldn't even help us out.

17:10.840 --> 17:13.170
No, she's just
playing by the rules.

17:13.370 --> 17:14.210
You telling me
you weren't like that

17:14.410 --> 17:15.390
when you started
on the job?

17:15.590 --> 17:16.810
No. You telling me you were?

17:18.120 --> 17:20.390
Hey, uh, is it true,
what Nisi said,

17:20.590 --> 17:21.520
about you having a kid?

17:21.720 --> 17:23.440
What? No.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.530
That was part of my cover.

17:25.730 --> 17:27.530
I needed to find a way
to get her to trust me,

17:27.730 --> 17:28.690
so I invented a kid.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.450
Is that
a traffic camera?

17:32.650 --> 17:34.100
STREET:
Uh, yeah, why?

17:34.300 --> 17:35.840
Maybe we don't
need that visitor log

17:36.040 --> 17:38.790
that Janice is keeping
under lock and key.

17:42.010 --> 17:43.680
Hey, it was a good call
from Street and Powell.

17:43.870 --> 17:45.330
I think I might have found
something on that traffic cam.

17:45.530 --> 17:47.200
Every Monday,
around visiting time,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.200
a Sprinter van drives by,
headed towards the prison.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.640
License plate
starts with an "N."

17:50.840 --> 17:51.770
Know who it's
registered to?

17:51.970 --> 17:53.640
Yeah, a Donald Mason.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.510
He tagged a woman
called Candy Schumer

17:55.710 --> 17:57.300
on his social media.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.650
She robbed a pharmacy
a few years back.

17:58.850 --> 17:59.690
We were actually
the ones who arrested her.

17:59.890 --> 18:00.910
HICKS:
Think I remember that.

18:01.110 --> 18:01.870
LUCA:
She served four years.

18:02.070 --> 18:03.170
Got released last week.

18:03.370 --> 18:04.830
Hoffman was
the guard on her pod.

18:05.030 --> 18:06.650
Oh, well, what're you
doing still standing here?

18:06.850 --> 18:08.560
Get the othersand go.You got it.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.050
TAN:
25-David.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.530
I have two
possible kids

18:15.730 --> 18:17.100
in the front room.

18:17.300 --> 18:18.620
HONDO:
No record of the
suspect having kids.

18:18.820 --> 18:19.840
High probability they're
Eddie and Evie Wilson.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.320
26-David. Got two possible

18:21.520 --> 18:22.980
adult heat signatures
in the back bedroom.

18:23.180 --> 18:24.500
Both stationary.

18:24.700 --> 18:25.890
Copy that. Tan, Powell,
handle the two kids.

18:26.090 --> 18:27.240
Stevens, cover the perimeter.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.750
Covert entry. Let's go.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.280
Luca.

18:35.020 --> 18:36.200
[drill whirs]

18:49.650 --> 18:51.260
HONDO:
LAPD. Get up.

18:52.210 --> 18:54.040
Get up.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.010
Hey.

18:56.210 --> 18:57.740
[moans]

18:58.740 --> 19:00.450
Who are you?

19:00.650 --> 19:02.750
The repo guy send you?

19:02.950 --> 19:03.890
I already told him,

19:04.090 --> 19:05.920
the van is in the shop.

19:07.100 --> 19:09.540
TAN:
Kitchen clear.

19:09.740 --> 19:12.490
Wrong kids.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.330
Hondo, they
aren't Wilson's kids.

19:17.530 --> 19:19.200
Wilson, what?

19:20.370 --> 19:22.550
She's not our suspect.

19:31.210 --> 19:33.220
STREET:Jonesing to
get out of here?

19:33.420 --> 19:34.610
If you help us out,

19:34.810 --> 19:36.140
maybe we can get you
home in time for dinner.

19:36.340 --> 19:38.960
You just got out of L.A.
County Women's Prison.

19:39.160 --> 19:40.400
What can you tell us about
two guards working there,

19:40.600 --> 19:41.490
Hoffman and...

19:41.690 --> 19:43.230
That lowlife piece of crap.

19:43.430 --> 19:46.790
Okay. What'd he do to
earn such high praise?

19:53.930 --> 19:56.760
Yeah, it's a hard hole
to climb out of.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.280
Every time I manage,
I seem to fall right back in.

20:02.670 --> 20:05.300
Except this time, I didn't fall.

20:05.490 --> 20:07.470
He pushed me.

20:07.670 --> 20:09.650
Hoffman supplied you with drugs?

20:09.850 --> 20:13.170
[scoffs]. Drugs, hair dye,
extra phone credit, Milk Duds.

20:13.370 --> 20:15.000
Whatever your
jonesing for,

20:15.200 --> 20:17.220
he gets it for you.

20:17.420 --> 20:19.660
Then he takes payment.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.180
What kind of payment?

20:21.380 --> 20:22.880
What kind do you think?

20:23.080 --> 20:23.920
[scoffs]

20:24.120 --> 20:25.530
I only got
one way to pay,

20:25.730 --> 20:28.230
and it don't involve
the exchange of cash money.

20:28.430 --> 20:31.360
So he was forcing you to
have sex in exchange for drugs.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.670
Not just me.

20:32.870 --> 20:34.930
How many other women?

20:35.130 --> 20:36.540
Let's just say

20:36.740 --> 20:39.680
the prison was his own
personal pick and mix bar.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.030
And no one ever
made a complaint?

20:41.230 --> 20:42.640
Oh, I tried.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.200
Hoffman claimed I was lying,
then tossed my cell.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.860
Said he found dope.

20:47.060 --> 20:50.040
Three more months
added to my sentence,

20:50.230 --> 20:53.130
so never complained again.
Neither did anyone else.

20:53.330 --> 20:54.470
And Wilson.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.130
Was he a part of this?

20:56.330 --> 20:59.120
Wilson, nah.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.260
We used to call him Jesus.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.650
You want to know why?

21:05.870 --> 21:08.230
'Cause he'd turn
the other cheek.

21:08.430 --> 21:11.010
Yeah, he'd stand guard
outside the chapel

21:11.210 --> 21:12.800
where Hoffman would
hold his "communion,"

21:13.000 --> 21:14.190
as he liked to call it.

21:14.390 --> 21:15.630
He wouldn't
do nothing

21:15.830 --> 21:17.760
to stop it.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.410
Can you give us the names

21:19.610 --> 21:20.940
of the other women

21:21.140 --> 21:22.150
that Hoffman assaulted?

21:22.350 --> 21:23.490
I could.

21:24.410 --> 21:26.290
But I'm not going to.

21:26.490 --> 21:29.680
Someone abducted
Wilson's wife and his kids.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.290
Their lives
are at risk.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.070
That's sad.

21:35.940 --> 21:37.210
Jitters have already set in.

21:37.410 --> 21:38.870
How long until
you're feeling like

21:39.070 --> 21:42.090
you could chop off
your own hand for a fix?

21:42.290 --> 21:43.180
STREET:
Hey, look at me.

21:43.380 --> 21:46.400
Come on, we can help you out.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.700
We can get you
into rehab.

21:47.900 --> 21:48.960
You do not

21:49.160 --> 21:50.310
need to do this
the hard way.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.310
[scoffs]

21:54.870 --> 21:56.570
You see this?

21:57.660 --> 21:59.190
This is me

21:59.390 --> 22:02.750
doing as Jesus taught,
turning the other cheek.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.280
See how Wilson likes it.

22:08.710 --> 22:10.290
We knew
Hoffman and Wilson

22:10.490 --> 22:11.330
were up to something.

22:11.530 --> 22:12.290
They were
handing out candy,

22:12.490 --> 22:13.810
just wasn't
free candy.

22:14.010 --> 22:15.290
Well, now we know
the kidnappers' motive,

22:15.490 --> 22:16.820
and according to the
woman I just interrogated,

22:17.020 --> 22:18.300
a lot of people shared it,

22:18.500 --> 22:19.910
so we're no closer to
narrowing down a suspect.

22:20.110 --> 22:21.080
You think the warden
knows what's going on,

22:21.280 --> 22:22.430
and is covering it up?

22:22.630 --> 22:23.820
No, my contact
at DOC told me

22:24.020 --> 22:25.260
the warden's
a good guy.

22:25.460 --> 22:27.090
The prison's a big place,
a lot going on,

22:27.290 --> 22:28.390
and with a guard like Hoffman
controlling the information,

22:28.590 --> 22:30.220
more than likely,
he was just unaware.

22:30.420 --> 22:31.310
Sir.

22:31.510 --> 22:32.960
Turn that up.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.140
...yet to release any
information about the victim

22:35.340 --> 22:36.790
or a possible motive,

22:36.990 --> 22:38.750
but according
to a local resident,

22:38.950 --> 22:40.490
the hit-and-run appears
to have been intentional...

22:40.690 --> 22:41.760
Aw, damn it.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.320
We got to find
Wilson's family

22:43.520 --> 22:45.190
before the media gets
ahold of Hoffman's name

22:45.390 --> 22:47.760
and starts blasting it
across the airwaves.[phone vibrates]

22:47.960 --> 22:48.810
These kidnappers find out
that Wilson screwed up

22:49.010 --> 22:49.940
and didn't kill Hoffman,

22:50.140 --> 22:50.980
they might decide they got

22:51.180 --> 22:52.380
no more use for his family.

22:52.570 --> 22:53.460
Wilson just got
out of surgery.

22:53.660 --> 22:54.420
I'm gonna head
to the hospital

22:54.620 --> 22:56.250
and interview him now.

22:56.450 --> 22:57.950
I'm gonna hit him with what
we just found out from Candy

22:58.150 --> 22:59.430
and force him to
give us some names.

22:59.630 --> 23:00.950
Well, don't push him too hard.
We need him

23:01.150 --> 23:02.810
to work with us,
not try to off himself again.

23:09.250 --> 23:10.740
Look, finding
the kidnappers' van

23:10.940 --> 23:12.220
is like trying to find a needle

23:12.420 --> 23:14.140
in a haystack the size
of Dodger Stadium.

23:14.340 --> 23:16.090
I'm checking traffic cams
in Wilson's neighborhood,

23:16.290 --> 23:17.840
see if any caught a better
angle on the license plate.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.920
You thought any more about

23:20.120 --> 23:21.400
what you're gonna do
about Bonnie?

23:21.600 --> 23:23.140
I think Powell's right.

23:23.340 --> 23:25.020
Not sure I'd ever be able
to trust her again.

23:25.220 --> 23:26.500
Look, you would've asked
me a year ago,

23:26.700 --> 23:28.110
I'd have been on Powell's
side of the fence,

23:28.310 --> 23:29.110
but knowing what I do now,

23:29.310 --> 23:30.460
I don't think an affair

23:30.660 --> 23:31.890
has to be the end of a marriage.

23:32.090 --> 23:33.500
I mean, my dad
told my mom

23:33.700 --> 23:35.370
about his affair right
after it happened, right?

23:35.570 --> 23:36.680
She kicked him out.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.380
And he worked really hard
to show her

23:38.580 --> 23:39.640
how sorry he was, and
eventually, she took him back.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.380
It's been almost 40 years,

23:41.580 --> 23:42.510
and they're happier
than ever, you know?

23:42.710 --> 23:44.560
Kind of made them stronger.

23:44.760 --> 23:47.390
You think I should
give Bonnie another chance?

23:47.590 --> 23:49.390
No, I'm not saying that. I just
think it's worth considering.

23:49.590 --> 23:50.650
Look, whatever
you decide,

23:50.850 --> 23:51.830
I'm here for you, man.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.560
Thanks.

23:54.910 --> 23:57.180
Figure out what you're
gonna do with the spare room,

23:57.380 --> 23:59.360
once you air out
the smell of Street's socks?

23:59.550 --> 24:01.880
[laughs] Stevens suggested
a music room.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.530
Back in the day,

24:03.730 --> 24:05.490
Terry and I had a band called
the Supernova Firebirds.

24:05.690 --> 24:07.190
We were gonna be
the next Moötley Cruüe.

24:07.390 --> 24:08.930
Wait, so what are you
doing on SWAT

24:09.130 --> 24:10.630
when you could be
snorting lines of ants

24:10.830 --> 24:11.760
and setting fire to hotel beds?

24:11.960 --> 24:13.630
[laughs] Dude, it was the '80s.

24:13.830 --> 24:15.070
Video games were invented.

24:15.270 --> 24:16.070
There went our ambition,

24:16.270 --> 24:17.160
you know?

24:17.350 --> 24:18.640
[phone vibrates]

24:18.830 --> 24:20.810
Hey, it's Wilson's phone.
It's the kidnappers.

24:21.010 --> 24:23.500
Start tracing the number.Yeah.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.640
LUCA: They're asking Wilson
if he's killed Hoffman yet.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.470
TAN:
We need their phone
to stay switched on

24:28.670 --> 24:30.470
as long as possible so we can
pinpoint its exact location.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.170
LUCA:
All right, I'll try
to stall them.

24:32.370 --> 24:33.430
Tell them to send proof that

24:33.630 --> 24:35.430
Wilson's wife and
kids are still alive.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.260
You haven't found them.

24:45.220 --> 24:47.450
I wish you'd just killed me.

24:47.650 --> 24:49.480
Yeah, well,
unlucky for you, I didn't.

24:50.660 --> 24:52.930
We know what Hoffman was
up to, assaulting prisoners.

24:53.130 --> 24:54.580
And you just stood by
and let it happen.

24:54.780 --> 24:58.060
Hoffman said that he'd
get me fired if I said anything.

24:59.320 --> 25:01.290
My wife has cancer.

25:01.490 --> 25:03.940
I can't risk losing my
job and our health care.

25:04.140 --> 25:06.160
Well, if we had known at
the start what this was about,

25:06.360 --> 25:07.550
we would've known where to look.

25:07.750 --> 25:09.120
Instead, we've been
chasing our tails.

25:09.320 --> 25:11.210
Jamie, you must have some
idea who took your family.

25:11.410 --> 25:12.560
I don't. I-I swear.

25:12.760 --> 25:13.690
The only way

25:13.890 --> 25:17.260
to save them was
to kill Hoffman.

25:17.460 --> 25:18.700
And I screwed up.

25:18.890 --> 25:20.040
[cries]

25:20.240 --> 25:22.130
It's too late. I can't...

25:22.330 --> 25:25.700
You're panicking, and that
is not gonna help your family.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.260
[panting]

25:30.790 --> 25:32.090
Look at me.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.320
When people feel threatened,

25:35.520 --> 25:37.630
their fight, flight,
freeze response kicks in.

25:37.830 --> 25:39.530
But you can train yourself
to overcome it.

25:40.750 --> 25:42.360
Jamie, take a deep breath.

25:43.670 --> 25:45.030
[inhales]

25:45.230 --> 25:46.810
Okay, now you
let it out slowly.

25:47.010 --> 25:48.160
[exhales]

25:48.360 --> 25:50.990
Focus on an image,
a positive one.

25:51.190 --> 25:52.380
Your children.

25:52.580 --> 25:54.340
Remember the
first time

25:54.540 --> 25:55.810
you held them
in your arms.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.380
There you go.

26:01.420 --> 26:02.570
Now you see that?

26:02.760 --> 26:03.700
Your heart
rate's dropping.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.860
Now you can
think more clearly.

26:07.690 --> 26:09.050
Jamie, your kids
need you right now.

26:09.250 --> 26:10.750
Your wife needs you
real bad right now.

26:10.950 --> 26:12.040
There's still time to save them.

26:13.870 --> 26:15.580
Okay.

26:15.780 --> 26:18.840
Now, walk me through what
the kidnappers said to you.

26:19.040 --> 26:22.590
Th... They-they said
I had to kill Huevo.

26:22.780 --> 26:25.760
That's what the
Latina prisoners call Hoffman.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.550
"Egg," because he's bald.

26:28.750 --> 26:30.460
Does-does that help?

26:30.660 --> 26:32.120
It might.

26:32.320 --> 26:35.590
I know that you think
that I'm a coward.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.680
I'm so ashamed of myself.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.380
But I wouldn't have shot you.

26:45.080 --> 26:47.340
No one's born brave, Jamie.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.270
That's something
you learn by doing,

26:53.470 --> 26:56.220
and admitting what you
just did, that took courage.

26:57.570 --> 26:59.310
Seems like a first step to me.

27:06.140 --> 27:07.240
Cell phone towers
put the kidnappers' phone

27:07.440 --> 27:08.850
somewhere within
Hillside Hospital.

27:09.050 --> 27:10.420
That's where they took
Hoffman after the hit-and-run.

27:10.610 --> 27:11.460
It's also where
they took Wilson.

27:11.660 --> 27:13.330
Hondo's there right now.

27:13.530 --> 27:14.850
Yeah, what's up, Luca?

27:15.050 --> 27:16.200
LUCA:
Hey, kidnappers' phone

27:16.400 --> 27:17.600
just dinged.
It's at the hospital,

27:17.800 --> 27:18.600

Mommy![Julie yells]

38:07.150 --> 38:09.120
[crying]:
My babies.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.980
This should feel like
a good outcome, but it doesn't.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.690
Yeah, I feel you.

38:14.890 --> 38:16.250
I'm gonna head to the hospital

38:16.450 --> 38:18.120
and let Wilson know
his family's okay.

38:28.390 --> 38:29.790
My friend at the
Department of Corrections,

38:29.990 --> 38:31.310
he's ordered an immediate
inquiry into Hoffman

38:31.510 --> 38:33.140
and the women he abused, so...

38:33.340 --> 38:34.400
hopefully they'll
get some form

38:34.600 --> 38:36.010
of support
and compensation.

38:36.210 --> 38:38.360
[sighs] And Hoffman?

38:38.560 --> 38:40.240
If he recovers,
he'll stand trial.

38:40.430 --> 38:41.670
Doctors say that's a big "if."

38:41.870 --> 38:44.240
Wish I could feel bad for him.

38:44.440 --> 38:45.940
Oh, Powell.

38:46.140 --> 38:48.200
My friend also
pulled some strings.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.420
They're gonna bring Nisi's
parole hearing forward,

38:50.620 --> 38:52.600
so she could be out
in a couple of months.

38:52.790 --> 38:55.290
That's awesome.Yeah.

38:55.490 --> 38:56.770
Uh, Commander?

38:56.970 --> 38:57.820
Any chance I could put in a word

38:58.020 --> 38:59.170
for a new recruit at LAPD?

38:59.370 --> 39:00.300
[chuckles]

39:00.500 --> 39:01.470
Her name's Janice Fisk.

39:01.670 --> 39:03.130
I think she'd make a great cop.

39:03.330 --> 39:04.820
A lot of integrity.

39:05.020 --> 39:07.960
Well, with a reference
like that, how could I say no?

39:08.160 --> 39:09.910
Send me
her application.

39:15.610 --> 39:18.360
Hey, Hondo?
How'd it go with Wilson?

39:18.560 --> 39:20.710
I'm sure he's happy to
hear his family are safe.

39:20.910 --> 39:22.760
Never seen a man so relieved.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.150
Well, that'll last
until he gets to lockup.

39:24.350 --> 39:25.890
He freaking out
about going to jail?

39:26.090 --> 39:27.330
Actually, he surprised me, sir.

39:27.530 --> 39:28.940
Apparently, some
wise man taught him

39:29.140 --> 39:31.160
that bravery isn't
something you're born with,

39:31.350 --> 39:32.420
but something
you got to choose to be.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.510
[chuckles]

39:34.710 --> 39:37.330
I wonder which wise man
originally said that.

39:46.640 --> 39:49.390
What you said earlier, about
needing to be honest with Nisi

39:49.590 --> 39:53.480
if I wanted her to open up...

39:53.680 --> 39:55.660
made me realize that
I'm not being honest

39:55.860 --> 39:58.570
with you either.
Or the rest of the team.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.790
The thing is,

40:01.990 --> 40:04.930
I don't trust people too easy,

40:05.130 --> 40:06.500
which makes it hard to open up.

40:06.690 --> 40:09.590
But being part of SWAT,
it's taught me that

40:09.780 --> 40:10.890
maybe there are people
I can trust.

40:11.090 --> 40:13.800
There are. Don't doubt it.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.640
Thomas. That's his name.

40:18.840 --> 40:19.730
I mean,
I don't know

40:19.930 --> 40:21.210
if that's his name now.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.030
His adoptive parents
probably changed it.

40:23.230 --> 40:26.080
I was 15. A kid having a kid.

40:26.280 --> 40:28.470
My parents
weren't happy,

40:28.670 --> 40:31.610
but they told me they would
help, so I had the baby.

40:31.810 --> 40:33.130
He was beautiful.

40:33.330 --> 40:35.520
Then my parents
came into the room

40:35.720 --> 40:38.000
and told me they found

40:38.200 --> 40:39.950
a couple who
wanted to adopt him.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.580
They told me if I kept him,
they wouldn't support me.

40:43.780 --> 40:44.750
I'd have to leave home.

40:44.950 --> 40:46.800
So...

40:47.000 --> 40:48.970
I signed the papers.

40:49.170 --> 40:51.020
I've never forgiven myself.

40:51.220 --> 40:52.720
Or them.

40:52.910 --> 40:54.400
I'm so sorry.

40:55.580 --> 40:57.580
Have you ever seen him?

40:58.760 --> 41:00.290
No.

41:00.490 --> 41:02.110
I hoped when he turned 18,
he'd reach out but...

41:04.410 --> 41:06.030
Don't give up hope.

41:06.230 --> 41:08.120
LUCA:
Hey, you guys coming for a beer?

41:08.320 --> 41:10.430
First round's on Tan.

41:10.630 --> 41:12.040
I can't tonight.

41:12.240 --> 41:14.350
I'm gonna go see Nisi,
give her some good news.

41:14.550 --> 41:15.650
But next time,
for sure. Yeah?

41:15.850 --> 41:16.960
Yeah, sorry, bro,
Chris is waiting for me.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.470
We got that lease
to sign, remember?

41:20.340 --> 41:21.700
Looks like it's just you and me.

41:21.900 --> 41:24.090
Maybe we can
talk more about Bonnie.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.230
Nah, it's okay.

41:26.430 --> 41:28.230
Made my decision.

41:28.430 --> 41:29.840
You guys getting back together?

41:30.040 --> 41:31.620
No.

41:31.820 --> 41:33.760
Hearing Street
just now,

41:33.960 --> 41:35.320
and seeing Hondo every day,

41:35.520 --> 41:37.370
excited to get home to
Nichelle and the baby,

41:37.570 --> 41:39.370
it made me realize,
I want what they have.

41:39.570 --> 41:41.460
Someone I want to
race home to,

41:41.660 --> 41:44.320
have a family with.
That's not Bonnie.

41:46.020 --> 41:48.120
Guess I should start looking
for a new place to live.

41:48.320 --> 41:49.600
Funny you should mention that.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.430
I might know of
a room freeing up.

41:51.630 --> 41:53.300
What, for real?

41:53.500 --> 41:54.860
I thought you had big plans
to turn it into a music room.

41:55.060 --> 41:56.210
You were gonna be the next
Tommy Lee, remember?

41:56.410 --> 41:58.390
Ah, the only good use
for a spare room

41:58.590 --> 41:59.950
is having friends come stay.

42:00.990 --> 42:02.480
How'd you feel about

42:02.680 --> 42:03.870
sharing your room

42:04.070 --> 42:05.440
with a Donkey Kong
arcade game, though?

42:05.640 --> 42:07.350
[laughs]Why not?
