[Louie] Hey, cuz, you've got to be here
tomorrow night.

01:05.250 --> 01:09.000
It's Louie's first annual
Carmen Meringue night.

01:09.083 --> 01:12.625
Admission's only $5.00,
and that includes fine food,

01:12.709 --> 01:17.750
fancy friends, and all the fruit
you can pile on your fuzzy head.

01:17.834 --> 01:20.291
[chuckles]
Sounds coconuts!

01:20.375 --> 01:21.625
Count me in.

01:21.709 --> 01:23.250
Count you out, Baloo.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.959
You lost all your money
at the Tortuga Turtle Toss.

01:26.041 --> 01:28.917
Oh, don't worry.
I'll just sweet talk, sweet Becky

01:29.000 --> 01:33.500
into giving me an advance on my pay.
No problem.

01:33.583 --> 01:36.709
[Rebecca]
Are you coconuts? Today is Thursday.

01:36.792 --> 01:39.125
Payday's not till Saturday.
The answer is no!

01:39.208 --> 01:41.041
No problem, huh?

01:41.125 --> 01:44.041
Well, I guess you can kiss
Louie's party goodbye.

01:44.125 --> 01:47.166
Says who?
Baloo never misses a party.

01:47.250 --> 01:49.250
But Miss Cunningham said no.

01:49.333 --> 01:52.917
Kiddo, when are you gonna learn?
No doesn't mean no.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.500
Well, what does it mean?

01:54.583 --> 01:56.959
It means you got to cut a corner,

01:57.041 --> 02:00.834
beg a favor, beat the system.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.834
[woman]
That was Roseberry Clooney singing,

02:03.917 --> 02:07.000
"These Tears Aren't For You,
I'm Just Peeling Onions."

02:07.083 --> 02:09.792
-You're listening to...
-Watch a pro at work.

02:09.875 --> 02:14.542
So, Baloo, what brings you here?
Another favor?

02:14.625 --> 02:19.500
Oh, Sally, how can you say that?
When was the last time I asked a favor?

02:19.583 --> 02:23.000
-Mm... last Monday.
-Uh, besides then.

02:23.083 --> 02:27.291
Uh, Wednesday before that,
then the Tuesday before that.

02:27.375 --> 02:30.625
Oh, then there was
the big favor two weeks ago Thursday.

02:30.709 --> 02:33.709
All right, already.
I need another one.

02:33.792 --> 02:37.375
A Saturday show
broadcast on Friday morning.

02:37.458 --> 02:40.792
And what favor do I get in return?

02:40.875 --> 02:43.709
Well, let me see...
I'll let you do my laundry.

02:43.792 --> 02:45.375
Think again.

02:45.458 --> 02:48.834
-All right. I'll do your laundry?
-No.

02:48.917 --> 02:52.250
-Uh, uh, take you on a plane ride?
-Getting warmer.

02:52.333 --> 02:54.583
Uh... [gulps]
date?

02:55.375 --> 02:57.000
Got yourself a favor.

02:57.083 --> 02:59.250
Watch a pro, huh?

03:02.542 --> 03:03.542
[elevator dings]

03:03.625 --> 03:08.500
Now remember, Kit, we have to change
all of Rebecca's calendars to Saturday.

03:11.583 --> 03:13.166
Baloo, I don't think we should.

03:13.250 --> 03:17.667
Don't be a spoil-sport, kiddo.
It's just a little joke.

03:34.625 --> 03:35.917
[moans softly]

03:36.000 --> 03:37.291
[teeth chattering]

03:42.625 --> 03:45.291
And now for the last touch.

03:45.375 --> 03:49.208
A special Saturday edition
I had made up.

03:51.917 --> 03:53.959
[alarm ringing]

03:56.333 --> 03:58.041
[yawns]

04:10.959 --> 04:12.291
Saturday?

04:13.542 --> 04:16.750
[Sally]
<i>Can you believe it's Saturday already?</i>

04:16.834 --> 04:18.541
<i>Where did Friday go?</i>

04:18.625 --> 04:22.375
<i>If time flies any faster</i>
<i>I'll need jet lag pills.</i>

04:22.458 --> 04:24.125
Now, here comes Becky.

04:24.208 --> 04:26.208
Keep your fingers crossed,
little britches.

04:26.291 --> 04:27.500
Morning, Becky.

04:27.583 --> 04:30.500
Morning, Baloo.
What day is it?

04:30.583 --> 04:33.542
Why, Saturday.
And a fine one, at that.

04:33.625 --> 04:36.625
Are you sure?
Wasn't yesterday Thursday?

04:36.709 --> 04:41.000
[Baloo chuckles] Oh, I get it.
Trying to kid your way out of payday.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.959
It's payday already?

04:46.542 --> 04:48.834
Well, I hate to take
the loot and scoot, but--

04:48.917 --> 04:52.917
Baloo, did you deliver
those telescopes to Myopia yesterday?

04:53.000 --> 04:56.417
Yesterday? I thought
they weren't due till Friday.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.125
[Rebecca]
Yesterday was Friday.

04:58.208 --> 05:02.750
They were supposed to be delivered in time
for the arrival of Cleanser's Comet.

05:02.834 --> 05:06.333
And what about the chinchilla earmuffs
that were supposed to go to Thembria?

05:06.417 --> 05:11.500
-I was, uh, about to get to it.
-What? I'm docking your pay.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.792
Now, Becky, I can explain.

05:13.875 --> 05:15.542
Are you up to something?

05:15.625 --> 05:19.375
OK, I confess.
It's not Saturday.

05:19.458 --> 05:23.041
I'm just pulling a practical joke
to push up payday.

05:23.125 --> 05:25.709
That's the lousiest,
lamest excuse I've ever heard.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.542
Of course, it's Saturday.
How much evidence do you need?

05:28.625 --> 05:31.083
Now, you've got two days
worth of deliveries to make.

05:31.166 --> 05:32.625
We don't have time to waste.

05:32.709 --> 05:34.792
We? You're going, too?

05:34.875 --> 05:38.834
Somebody's got to apologize to Thembria
for your mistakes.

05:38.917 --> 05:41.166
If I leave it to you
who knows what you'll tell them.

05:41.250 --> 05:45.041
I know, I know.
You told me so.

05:50.959 --> 05:54.542
[Colonel Spigot]
Sergeant Dunder, watch the radar for me.

05:54.625 --> 05:56.500
Yes, Colonel Spigot, sir.

06:05.834 --> 06:07.291
[static]

06:10.375 --> 06:13.250
Who's to blame for this broken radio?

06:13.333 --> 06:15.667
Why? Is Broadcast Sally on?

06:15.750 --> 06:19.125
Sergeant Dunder,
need I remind you we Thembrians

06:19.208 --> 06:21.709
are only allowed to listen
to state programs.

06:21.792 --> 06:24.834
Broadcast Sally
from Cape Suzette is illegal.

06:24.917 --> 06:25.792
Against the law.

06:25.875 --> 06:30.083
I know, sir. And I never miss a chance
not to listen to her, too.

06:33.250 --> 06:36.625
[Sally] <i>And that was Chester Grisley's</i>
<i>latest platter,</i>

06:36.709 --> 06:40.166
<i>"My Love Crash-landed</i>
<i>On the Runway To Your Heart."</i>

06:40.250 --> 06:43.041
<i>Coming up next on this beautiful</i>
<i>Saturday morning...</i>

06:43.125 --> 06:47.875
Saturday? Sergeant Dunder, what day
are you stamping on those papers?

06:47.959 --> 06:49.208
Friday, sir.

06:49.291 --> 06:54.291
-And why do you think it's Friday?
-'Cause yesterday was Thursday.

06:54.375 --> 06:57.709
Actually, I could've sworn
yesterday was Thursday, too.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.458
Why does Broadcast Sally say Saturday?

07:00.542 --> 07:01.834
Maybe it's a mistake.

07:01.917 --> 07:05.667
No! This is a plot
by those capitalist swine in Cape Suzette.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.166
They're trying to be a day ahead of us.

07:08.250 --> 07:12.917
-Where are you going, uh, sir?
-To show those creeps in Suzette,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.208
they have nothing to fear
but Spigot himself.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.834
I must speak to you at once,
high marshal.

07:25.917 --> 07:27.917
What is it, Faucet?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.917
Spigot, oh, mighty mucky-muck.
Spigot.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.834
Are you contradicting the state?

07:34.917 --> 07:39.083
Oh, never, Your Potentness.
I'll change my name at once.

07:39.166 --> 07:40.959
Wait, I didn't come in here for this.

07:41.041 --> 07:44.041
I recommend we declare war,
Your High Marshalness.

07:44.125 --> 07:47.083
Uh, and, uh, why is that?

07:47.166 --> 07:51.458
[Spigot] Because those Cape Suzette swine
have declared today Saturday.

07:51.542 --> 07:54.166
Everyone knows today is Friday.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.625
People have payday,
day of the Cleanser Comet.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.709
[groans]
This makes me furious.

07:59.792 --> 08:02.834
[Spigot] I knew it would.
Let's nip it in the bud.

08:02.917 --> 08:06.709
If we give them a day,
they'll take a week. It's war!

08:06.792 --> 08:10.625
No, I'm furious we didn't
think of it first.

08:10.709 --> 08:13.250
I say we declare today Saturday, too.

08:13.333 --> 08:17.125
What? But what about the Cleanser Comet?
It's due today.

08:17.208 --> 08:19.542
If the people see it,
they'll know it's really Friday.

08:19.625 --> 08:24.125
It's overcast, has been for three years.
No one will see it.

08:24.208 --> 08:27.083
But what about people's paychecks?

08:27.166 --> 08:31.667
If the people don't show up on payday,
that's their fault.

08:31.750 --> 08:36.125
No paychecks?
But what if the people protest?

08:36.207 --> 08:39.041
Tell them it's your fault.

08:39.125 --> 08:40.625
Uh, my fault?

08:40.708 --> 08:43.166
Yes, sir, good idea, sir.

08:43.250 --> 08:45.583
Right away, o mighty mucky-muck.

08:49.750 --> 08:53.667
Sergeant Dunder, today is Saturday,
and it's all your fault!

08:53.750 --> 08:55.917
Yes, sir. I knew it would be, sir.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.166
Begin the paperwork while I make
the official announcement.

09:00.250 --> 09:04.333
Attention all Thembrians,
this is Colonel Spigot.

09:04.417 --> 09:06.375
<i>Perhaps you've heard of me.</i>

09:06.458 --> 09:08.667
[all groaning]

09:08.750 --> 09:11.166
[Spigot]
<i>Today is officially Saturday.</i>

09:11.250 --> 09:14.166
<i>Anyone who disagrees</i>
<i>will be sent to prison.</i>

09:14.250 --> 09:17.041
<i>Anyone who complains will do hard labor.</i>

09:17.125 --> 09:21.166
<i>Anyone who sneers will be shot.</i>
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

09:21.250 --> 09:24.959
[Dunder] Unidentified whatsit
flying on screen, Colonel Spigot.

09:25.041 --> 09:27.000
[beeping]

09:27.875 --> 09:29.625
Halt! Who flies there?

09:29.709 --> 09:34.041
Happy howdy to you, too.
This here's Baloo, with Higher for Hire.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.542
Now, who might you be?

09:35.625 --> 09:39.208
Colonel Spigot.
Perhaps you've heard of me.

09:39.291 --> 09:41.458
Not that I recollect, Spiggy.

09:41.542 --> 09:44.875
Hmm, never mind.
Just state your purpose.

09:44.959 --> 09:48.834
[Baloo] We're supposed to deliver a crate
of chinchilla earmuffs to Thembria.

09:48.917 --> 09:52.250
That delivery was due yesterday, Friday.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.750
Today is Friday.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.542
Wrong, flyboy.
Today is Saturday.

09:57.625 --> 09:59.375
-Friday.
-Saturday.

09:59.458 --> 10:00.959
-Friday!
-Saturday!

10:01.041 --> 10:02.375
-Friday!
-Saturday!

10:02.458 --> 10:04.959
Enough! Give it up, Baloo!

10:05.083 --> 10:09.417
Return to Cape Suzette at once
and apply for a Saturday passport.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.125
Not so fast, Baloo,

10:11.208 --> 10:14.917
I promised I'd deliver these earmuffs,
and Higher for Hire always delivers.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.458
-Keep going.
-[Spigot] <i>No, turn around.</i>

10:17.542 --> 10:18.875
-[Rebecca] Keep going.
-[Spigot] <i>Turn around!</i>

10:18.959 --> 10:21.834
-[Rebecca] Go! Go! Go! Go!
-[Spigot] <i>Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn!</i>

10:21.917 --> 10:23.834
[Baloo]
Swing your partner, dos-a-dos.

10:23.917 --> 10:25.917
You leave me no choice.

10:26.417 --> 10:30.542
Have the glorious people's air force
shoot down that plane.

10:30.625 --> 10:34.625
Can't. All the glorious
people's ammunition is on back order, sir.

10:34.709 --> 10:38.000
Surely, there must be
something we can shoot.

10:38.083 --> 10:43.125
-Careful, Baloo. Bathtubs at 2:00.
-Bathtubs? What are you talking about?

10:43.208 --> 10:45.333
[Baloo] It's a tub attack.

10:46.583 --> 10:47.625
Whoa!

10:52.375 --> 10:55.125
Welcome to Thembria.
Now, march!

10:55.208 --> 10:58.750
Hold it right there, Spiggy.
March where?

10:58.834 --> 11:01.166
To the clink to await trial.

11:01.250 --> 11:06.208
Oh, no. In Thembria, it could be months
before we get a trial.

11:06.291 --> 11:10.667
On the contrary,
trials are the one thing in Thembria

11:10.750 --> 11:13.041
that are swift and expedient.

11:13.125 --> 11:15.667
You'll have a fair trial,
then be shot.

11:15.750 --> 11:17.375
[all gasping]

11:19.875 --> 11:22.375
[announcer]
Welcome to another exciting episode

11:22.458 --> 11:26.750
of the glorious,
colossal <i>Thembrian People's Court.</i>

11:26.834 --> 11:29.375
Our trial's gonna be on the radio?

11:29.458 --> 11:33.166
Of course. It keeps the people in line
and gets good ratings.

11:33.250 --> 11:34.208
March!

11:34.792 --> 11:37.875
Today, illegal aliens from Cape Suzette

11:37.959 --> 11:40.709
will be prosecuted
to the fullest extent of the law

11:40.792 --> 11:46.208
by the head of our glorious
Thembrian air corps, Colonel Nozzle.

11:46.291 --> 11:47.333
Spigot!

11:49.542 --> 11:53.417
Your Honor, these spies
were traveling with expired passports.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.333
How you are pleading?

11:55.417 --> 11:56.583
Innocent.

11:56.667 --> 11:59.000
You can't plead the innocent.

11:59.083 --> 12:02.542
In Thembria, you are guilty
till proven innocent.

12:02.875 --> 12:07.667
Your Highfalutinness, this whole thing
was just a practical joke.

12:07.750 --> 12:12.291
I came up with a scam to make my boss here
believe it's Saturday

12:12.375 --> 12:13.959
so I could get paid early.

12:14.041 --> 12:16.000
But it's really Friday,

12:16.083 --> 12:19.750
-and that's the truth.
-I am not caring about truth.

12:19.834 --> 12:23.875
The state says it's Saturday.
You're guilty as charged.

12:23.959 --> 12:28.709
However, since this is first offense,
I will be lenient.

12:28.792 --> 12:31.959
-Boy is free to go.
-I won't go without Baloo.

12:32.041 --> 12:37.333
-OK. Big one is free, too.
-Oh, that's swell of you.

12:37.417 --> 12:41.583
Oh, thank you, Your Honor.
You're too kind.

12:41.667 --> 12:45.625
Hold it, poopskie!
You are going to firing squad.

12:45.709 --> 12:46.625
What?

12:47.125 --> 12:51.458
[judge] You are boss, leader of pack,
big cheese, top dog, honcho.

12:51.542 --> 12:53.333
So, buck stops with you.

12:53.417 --> 12:56.417
Court adjourned.
Please to have a nice execution.

13:01.542 --> 13:05.041
I've really done it this time,
little britches.

13:05.125 --> 13:07.875
Well, you can't just sit here
and feel sorry for yourself.

13:07.959 --> 13:11.375
-You've got to save Miss Cunningham.
-How?

13:11.458 --> 13:14.291
The only thing I do well
is beat the system.

13:14.375 --> 13:16.750
And look how much trouble that's caused.

13:16.834 --> 13:19.166
Well, then why don't you
try something different,

13:19.250 --> 13:21.500
like not beating the system?

13:21.583 --> 13:24.709
You mean don't cut any corners?

13:25.125 --> 13:28.542
No sneaky tricks or creative schemes?

13:28.625 --> 13:31.458
Do everything on the up and up?

13:31.542 --> 13:33.375
Wait a minute. That's it.

13:33.875 --> 13:36.750
Come on, little britches.
We're going to save Becky,

13:36.834 --> 13:39.083
totally on the up and up.

13:39.792 --> 13:41.750
[Rebecca] No!

13:45.500 --> 13:48.750
Wait, please.
You're making a big mistake.

13:50.375 --> 13:51.667
Up, Dunder.

13:52.333 --> 13:56.041
No, you made the mistake
of crossing paths

13:56.125 --> 14:01.500
with the merciless, tyrannical, infamous,
impersonable Colonel Spigot.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.041
Down.

14:03.792 --> 14:05.458
How long do I have to stay here?

14:05.542 --> 14:08.000
Until your execution paperwork
is filled out.

14:08.458 --> 14:11.834
Oh, in this country,
that could take weeks.

14:11.917 --> 14:14.709
For executions, we use short forms.

14:14.792 --> 14:18.500
-Is that a short joke?
-Guilty.

14:20.583 --> 14:24.792
Oh, Baloo. Help me.

14:26.667 --> 14:30.542
[Baloo] You remember those telescopes
we were to deliver to Myopia?

14:30.625 --> 14:33.208
The ones for Cleanser's Comet? Yeah.

14:33.291 --> 14:36.917
Well, the comet is supposed
to be here on Friday.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.083
Now, if everyone sees it then,
they'll know what day it really is,

14:41.166 --> 14:43.041
and Becky will be home free.

14:43.125 --> 14:45.458
But it's always cloudy in Thembria.

14:45.875 --> 14:48.917
It won't be once I get back the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

14:49.000 --> 14:54.250
I have a flying stunt that will
really clear up this misunderstanding.

14:58.458 --> 15:02.959
Excuse me, Mr. Customs Officer,
I'm here to claim the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

15:03.041 --> 15:08.375
It was escorted in this morning
by your glorious air corps.

15:08.458 --> 15:12.959
Ah, yes. It has been
permanently confiscated by the state.

15:13.041 --> 15:14.709
What? Why?

15:14.792 --> 15:18.834
It's being converted
into apartments for the people.

15:19.542 --> 15:20.667
Oh, no!

15:21.250 --> 15:24.291
[Baloo] We've got to find the <i>Sea Duck</i>
before it goes condo.

15:24.375 --> 15:27.542
My plane! It's gone.

15:30.792 --> 15:33.041
I have good news, Miss Cunningham.

15:33.125 --> 15:36.750
Don't tell me,
is it possible Baloo got me freed?

15:36.834 --> 15:40.792
No. For your execution,
we're letting you choose your noose.

15:40.875 --> 15:44.875
Take this lovely seersucker sheepshank
or this taffeta timberknot.

15:44.959 --> 15:48.792
You're a barbarian!
Hey, wait a minute.

15:49.417 --> 15:52.041
I thought I was being
sent to the firing squad.

15:52.125 --> 15:56.709
You are.
In Thembria, you're shot, then hung.

15:56.792 --> 15:57.709
We like to be thorough.

15:57.792 --> 15:59.792
Oh...

16:07.000 --> 16:09.458
[applause]

16:11.667 --> 16:14.291
That's the firing squad?

16:14.375 --> 16:16.625
Like I said, we're thorough.

16:21.166 --> 16:24.333
Just stand right here,
and we'll get the show going.

16:24.417 --> 16:28.375
-Show?
-You're going on the radio again.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.417
Yes, Rebecca Cunningham,

16:31.500 --> 16:35.834
you're the featured guest on
<i>This Was Your Life,</i>

16:35.917 --> 16:40.834
the radio program that asks the question,
"Was it worth it?"

16:42.125 --> 16:44.667
No! [crying]

16:44.750 --> 16:47.834
-No, it can't be.
-What?

16:47.917 --> 16:49.917
That is the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

16:50.000 --> 16:52.750
What have they done to my plane?

16:52.959 --> 16:56.542
It looks like a centerfold
for <i>Better Homes and Cockpits.</i>

16:56.625 --> 17:01.500
You were born in Cape Suzette
where you attended a private school.

17:01.583 --> 17:04.625
Here is a voice from your past.
Recognize it?

17:05.208 --> 17:10.083
[woman] <i>I remember Rebecca.</i>
<i>She was such an ambitious little girl.</i>

17:10.208 --> 17:11.583
<i>Pretty, too.</i>

17:11.666 --> 17:16.125
-Miss Tuttle, my third grade teacher?
-That's right!

17:16.208 --> 17:20.959
We flew her to Thembria
especially for this broadcast.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.333
And to think your class voted you

17:24.416 --> 17:27.959
least likely to be shot by a firing squad.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.166
[clicking tongue]

17:31.750 --> 17:35.875
Congratulations, ma'am.
You're the lucky winner

17:35.959 --> 17:38.959
of the Thembria Clearing House
Snow Plow Sweepstakes!

17:39.041 --> 17:41.417
I am? What did I win?

17:41.500 --> 17:45.125
A glorious state surplus snow plow shovel.

17:45.208 --> 17:48.333
It was custom made for your lovely home.

17:48.542 --> 17:52.750
Now, turn around and close your eyes,
while we get it ready.

17:54.291 --> 17:56.291
[birds squawking]

17:56.375 --> 17:57.375
[engine starts]

17:57.458 --> 18:01.625
All right.
Turn around and say bye-bye.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.709
[Kit]
Good job, Papa Bear.

18:06.792 --> 18:10.542
But I don't think this is
exactly on the up and up?

18:10.625 --> 18:14.417
'Course it is.
We're gaining altitude, aren't we?

18:14.500 --> 18:19.583
You recently inherited a courier service
from your father

18:19.667 --> 18:22.959
where you quickly learned
to enslave the workers.

18:23.041 --> 18:26.250
[crying]
Please stop.

18:26.333 --> 18:29.333
Get this over with.
Shoot me!

18:30.125 --> 18:32.917
[Baloo] See, I told you
I could clear up this situation.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.667
We'll see that comet for sure.

18:35.750 --> 18:39.041
Wow! The world's first cloud plower.

18:39.125 --> 18:42.542
Uh-oh. And it looks like I'm the last.

18:52.166 --> 18:54.709
-Pull up, Baloo!
-I'm trying.

18:54.792 --> 18:57.792
-I can't get the nose up!
-Why not?

18:57.917 --> 19:02.125
There's too much nose!
Get me some schnozz throttle.

19:15.750 --> 19:19.041
[chuckles]
Well, it's shower curtains for them.

19:19.125 --> 19:24.375
Yeah, and it's curtains for Becky, too.
No one's gonna see that comet now.

19:25.291 --> 19:27.000
Want to bet?

19:27.083 --> 19:31.458
Put on a happy face,
'cause gray skies are going to clear up.

19:31.542 --> 19:34.083
Now why does that sounds familiar?

19:38.750 --> 19:41.917
Whoo! Yahoo!

19:48.875 --> 19:51.625
The boy's doing me proud.

19:51.709 --> 19:55.625
And now, Rebecca, our last guest.

19:55.709 --> 19:58.667
[Spigot] <i>Miss Cunningham and I</i>
<i>know each other well.</i>

19:58.750 --> 20:00.834
<i>Of course, everyone knows me.</i>

20:01.375 --> 20:03.542
Let me guess.
Colonel Drainpipe.

20:03.625 --> 20:07.125
That's Spigot!
For the last time, Spigot!

20:07.208 --> 20:10.458
And now, for our really big show.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.667
Ready... aim...

20:15.750 --> 20:17.166
[gasps]

20:17.250 --> 20:18.250
[yelps]

20:22.041 --> 20:26.333
Oh, look!
It's Cleanser's Comet!

20:26.417 --> 20:27.959
[all exclaiming]

20:28.041 --> 20:29.375
It is Friday.

20:29.458 --> 20:32.208
[all] Payday! [cheering]

20:32.291 --> 20:33.625
I've been saved!

20:33.709 --> 20:36.750
Uh-oh. Someone's in trouble now.

20:37.166 --> 20:40.583
Would it make you feel any better
if this was my fault?

20:40.667 --> 20:44.500
Of course. It's his fault!
I had nothing to do with this.

20:48.458 --> 20:50.333
Baloo, you saved me!

20:50.417 --> 20:54.291
Yep. And you'll be happy to know I didn't
even have to beat the system, to do it.

20:54.375 --> 20:58.625
-You mean, you didn't cut any corners?
-Well, maybe just a little trim.

20:58.709 --> 21:01.125
You didn't pull a scam
or cheat or anything?

21:01.208 --> 21:04.583
Nope.
'Course, don't hold me to the truth.

21:04.667 --> 21:08.417
I won't, but just get me
out of this slush pit!

21:24.250 --> 21:26.667
I am one changed bear.

21:27.083 --> 21:29.166
Well, I think I'll just head over
to Louie's

21:29.250 --> 21:31.709
and see how last night's party went.

21:31.792 --> 21:35.000
Think again.
Here comes your Saturday date.

21:39.291 --> 21:44.333
Uh, one more favor, Becky. Just one more.
Make me work tonight.

21:44.417 --> 21:46.458
Free overtime, huh?

21:46.542 --> 21:49.959
I'll do anything. Please?

21:52.542 --> 21:58.166
Oh, after all you've put me through?
You deserve this night off.

22:03.250 --> 22:04.792
But, but, but, but...

22:04.875 --> 22:08.542
Ready for a night on the town, big bear?

22:10.625 --> 22:12.125
You owe me one, Becky.

22:12.208 --> 22:14.125
You owe me.
