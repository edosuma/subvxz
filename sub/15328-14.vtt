- Child Services?

09:33.531 --> 09:36.325

- What? What's wrong
with this sweater?

10:53.361 --> 10:54.070
- Nothing, if you're going down
to the freight yards

10:54.153 --> 10:57.823

I'm old enough to dress myself.

11:42.576 --> 11:45.704
I've got my church suit
all ready.

11:45.788 --> 11:46.789

see you at school all day.

she wasn't worth writing

13:31.852 --> 13:35.397
this letter, she does
something adorable like that.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.566
Maybe I can cut and paste
all my drafts together.

Anything is better than this.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.041
- It's normally nice in here.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.543
We have a prayer group.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.878
I'm lying,
we don't have a prayer group.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.046
But if you take my kids,

18:51.129 --> 18:53.465
I'm going to need
a prayer group.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.466
- Kids?

18:54.550 --> 18:55.592
I'm not talking about your kids.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.386
I'm talking about your cats.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.221
And I'm taking them.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.264
- What now?

19:00.347 --> 19:01.890
- Yeah.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.059
What about us
being terrible parents?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.228
- Oh, please,
I see ten families a day.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.564
Your little one
tried to get ready by himself.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.440
That one lost something
in the garbage.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.693
And the older woman
has Tourette's.

19:15.237 --> 19:18.240
- I got your Tourette's
right here.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.784
- No, no, no, no, no!

19:26.248 --> 19:27.791
Yep, yep, that's--that's
what it is.

19:27.875 --> 19:32.337
I am so glad you understand.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.674
- Uh, so can you help me
gather those three rescue cats?

19:35.757 --> 19:36.967
- Oh, this is your lucky day.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.260
There are nine.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.637
How big is your car?

19:40.721 --> 19:43.515
- [knocking at door]

19:46.852 --> 19:47.978
- Hey, James.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.146
- I'm sorry.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.439
I had some really good stuff
for your letter,

19:50.522 --> 19:51.481
but it got thrown out.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.942
- James, I have
something to tell you.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.654
I met another boy in mime class.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.032
We were trapped
in a box together.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.371
- So I'm covered in garbage
for nothing?

20:11.752 --> 20:12.669
You know what?

20:12.753 --> 20:15.130
Fine! I don't need you!

20:15.213 --> 20:18.592
Grace, take me back!

20:18.675 --> 20:19.968
- Oh, no!

20:20.052 --> 20:22.137
He's thrown himself
on the hood of her mom's car.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.555
And the neighbors are watching.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.974
- Yeah, don't look at us
like that, Mrs. Mahary.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.310
Child Services says we're fine!

20:28.393 --> 20:28.602
