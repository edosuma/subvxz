WEBVTT

00:07.094 --> 00:08.225
[knocking on door]

00:08.269 --> 00:10.097
Ooh, that can't be
Lorenzo and Claire.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.402
They're never early.

00:11.446 --> 00:13.448
Maybe they smelled your cooking.

00:15.580 --> 00:19.280
[laughs]No, it's just the freeloaders
that smelled it.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.805
I'm sorry, I didn't know
freeloaders paid rent.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.937
Yeah, I still say we
pay too much rent.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.287
Look at this place.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.679
All right, now, where's
that pot roast I smell?

00:27.723 --> 00:29.638
[laughs]:
Yeah.Whoa, not so fast.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.292
That food is for company.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.381
Not for people who we love
and care about.

00:33.424 --> 00:34.382
Get out.

00:34.425 --> 00:35.948
What? Wh...Oh...

00:35.992 --> 00:38.212
Don't worry.
Mommy made you boys some extra.

00:38.255 --> 00:39.952
[both laugh]

00:39.996 --> 00:41.171
Now get out.

00:43.739 --> 00:44.957
Oh, I get it.

00:45.001 --> 00:46.394
Y'all get a kitchen island

00:46.437 --> 00:49.092
and suddenly
you're too good for us.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.311
Suddenly?

00:50.354 --> 00:51.660
We were too good for y'all

00:51.703 --> 00:53.096
when we got
the George Foreman Grill.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.184
Bye-bye.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.319
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

00:58.362 --> 00:59.581
♪ Welcome to the hood.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.066
Oh, my G-- I love

01:06.109 --> 01:07.850
the renovations, you guys.Thank you.

01:07.893 --> 01:09.417
Yeah, who was your contractor?

01:09.460 --> 01:11.549
An earthquake.[laughs]

01:11.593 --> 01:13.420
And just like most contractors,

01:13.464 --> 01:15.553
she showed up
whenever she felt like it.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.470
Uh, hey, guys, that was Gemma.

01:19.514 --> 01:20.819
She's stuck at work,
so it looks like

01:20.863 --> 01:23.039
you're with just Dave tonight.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.997
[chuckles]
Solo Dave.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.174
Dave after dark.

01:27.217 --> 01:29.654
Maybe we'll just keep
the lights on.

01:31.482 --> 01:32.962
Hey, so Calvin said
you guys used to live

01:33.005 --> 01:34.572
in the neighborhood.
Why did you leave?

01:34.616 --> 01:36.270
'Cause the white people
started moving in.

01:36.313 --> 01:38.098
[laughter]

01:39.402 --> 01:40.491
He's joking.
Yeah.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.452
We moved to D.C. for a few
years for Lorenzo's job.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.976
Yeah, and when
they moved back, they moved

01:47.019 --> 01:48.456
to the Westside.

01:49.413 --> 01:50.936
Leaving us behind.

01:50.979 --> 01:53.113
I could never leave
you behind, C. Come on.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.027
Even though my best man tried

01:55.071 --> 01:57.116
to outshine me
at my own wedding.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.642
Hey, don't be mad because
I showed up suited and booted.

02:00.685 --> 02:03.210
You went with the basic black,
I showed up

02:03.253 --> 02:05.473
with the purple tux with
the Now & Later gators, man.

02:05.516 --> 02:07.997
[laughter]

02:08.039 --> 02:10.304
Well, I am so glad
you guys are back.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.741
So here's to picking up
where we left off.

02:12.784 --> 02:15.178
Yeah.I love you, babe.

02:15.222 --> 02:18.964
And I love you, too, baby,
just as much as I did back then.

02:19.008 --> 02:21.315
Aww.
Mwah.

02:21.358 --> 02:24.318
Man, this makes me want to marry
Gemma all over again just so you

02:24.361 --> 02:26.102
could be my best man.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.974
Remind me not to save the date.

02:29.018 --> 02:30.280
[laughs]

02:30.324 --> 02:31.934
Looks like I need a refill.

02:31.977 --> 02:34.545
Oh, yeah. You know where it is.
Right back there.

02:34.589 --> 02:38.201
Mm. All right,
so now that he is gone,

02:38.245 --> 02:40.203
we need to plan
our couples trip.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.204
And Dave, you and Gemma
should come this time.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.902
Oh, well, what are we thinking?

02:43.946 --> 02:46.166
Aloha or buenos días?

02:46.209 --> 02:48.820
We'll be lucky if it's
"welcome to Orange County."

02:48.864 --> 02:49.865
[laughs]

02:49.908 --> 02:51.040
Yeah, Lorenzo never wants

02:51.083 --> 02:52.302
to go anywhere anymore.

02:52.346 --> 02:55.478
Neither does Calvin
unless it's on Groupon.

02:55.523 --> 02:58.482
Tina, you sleeping on Groupon.
Literally.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.702
Those sheets? $25.

03:02.094 --> 03:04.532
Plus, 30% off
on teeth whitening.

03:07.274 --> 03:10.102
Yeah, looks like
I need a refill, also.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.408
All right.Yeah, me, too.

03:11.452 --> 03:13.236
I'm single tonight,

03:13.280 --> 03:14.716
so I'm gonna turn up.

03:17.022 --> 03:19.634
As soon as I can get away,
it'll just be you, me

03:19.677 --> 03:21.505
and those beautiful toes
of yours.

03:21.549 --> 03:23.333
[laughs]

03:23.377 --> 03:25.292
Bring the whipped cream.
[kissing sounds]

03:26.902 --> 03:28.295
Hey.

03:28.338 --> 03:30.688
Hey. Uh...

03:30.732 --> 03:32.690
How long you guys
been standing there?

03:32.734 --> 03:35.998
Long enough to know
that you into some freaky stuff.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.826
Whoa.

03:37.869 --> 03:40.481
What an incredible time
for me to lose my hearing.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.704
What is going on, Zo?

03:46.748 --> 03:49.098
I know you not out here
creeping on Claire.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.622
Y'all were just all
lovey-dovey on the couch.

03:51.666 --> 03:54.103
I got a lot of love
in my heart, C.

03:54.146 --> 03:56.497
Some of it is for Claire
and some of it's for this

03:56.540 --> 04:00.805
23-year-old, beautiful dental
assistant I met at Costco.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.417
You know what?

04:03.460 --> 04:06.420
We always said we'd keep it real
with each other.

04:06.463 --> 04:09.597
Well, is this little side piece
worth blowing up your marriage?

04:09.640 --> 04:10.989
I love Claire.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.688
But what she doesn't know
won't hurt her.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.037
And you got my back, right?

04:15.080 --> 04:17.300
Remember The Man Code.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.214
The Man Code?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.825
Don't come at me with that.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.957
Look, I'm not down
with your bull,

04:23.001 --> 04:25.526
but... I'm not a snitch, either.

04:25.569 --> 04:26.962
[quietly]:
What about your boy?

04:27.005 --> 04:28.964
Oh, he over there
telling Claire right now.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.966
Oh, my God...Look, look, look.

04:31.009 --> 04:33.838
Look, I'm just messing with you,

04:33.882 --> 04:35.840
but this a dangerous game
you playing.

04:40.409 --> 04:43.283
[laughs]:Stop.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.808
Stop!

04:46.851 --> 04:49.506
Oh, my gosh, you are so funny!

04:49.550 --> 04:51.247
I said stop!

04:51.291 --> 04:54.250
Oh, okay, okay, I'll
talk to you later.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.338
Hey, hon.

04:57.384 --> 05:00.256
Hey, who, uh,
who's the comedian?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.345
Jameson, the school's
soccer coach.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.825
I've been helping him
with scheduling.

05:03.868 --> 05:06.131
Oh. He really
had you laughing, huh?

05:06.175 --> 05:09.004
Yeah, I told him
he should do stand-up.

05:09.047 --> 05:10.919
Stand-up?

05:10.962 --> 05:12.224
[chuckles]

05:14.183 --> 05:15.619
I don't think
you ever said that to me.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.796
Yeah, well,
there's stand-up funny

05:18.840 --> 05:21.625
and then there's "sitting around
the house" funny.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.061
[phone ringing]

05:23.105 --> 05:25.194
Oh, it's Jameson again.

05:25.237 --> 05:27.457
[giggles]
I'm laughing already.

05:28.415 --> 05:29.851
Hey, Jameson.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.374
[laughs]

05:31.418 --> 05:33.811
Oh, my gosh, please stop!

05:33.855 --> 05:35.117
[snorts]

05:37.728 --> 05:40.034
Did she just snort?

05:43.299 --> 05:45.082
Tonight was fun.

05:45.127 --> 05:48.043
Yeah, nothing like
old friends, right?

05:48.086 --> 05:52.352
Eh, there was just something
different about Lorenzo.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.092
Really?

05:54.136 --> 05:57.879
He seemed like the same old
loud Lorenzo to me.

05:58.923 --> 06:00.969
No, I mean,

06:01.012 --> 06:04.015
every time he went into the
kitchen to freshen up his drink,

06:04.059 --> 06:06.017
he came back with
an empty glass.

06:07.018 --> 06:08.368
Maybe the man was thirsty.

06:10.370 --> 06:14.199
You know, Calvin, I don't mean
to talk about your boy, but...

06:14.243 --> 06:16.201
I think he may have
a drinking problem.

06:16.245 --> 06:19.857
Oh. You know, maybe you're
on to something with that.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.556
Uh, we'll plan his intervention
in the morning. Good night.

06:27.909 --> 06:30.868
Okay. What's going on, Calvin?

06:30.912 --> 06:32.696
[scoffs]
Well, the lights.

06:32.740 --> 06:35.264
Even though I just
turned them off.

06:35.307 --> 06:39.399
You ain't fooling
nobody, Calvin Butler.

06:39.442 --> 06:40.748
You know something.

06:40.791 --> 06:44.099
[chuckles]
Not at 11:59 at night, I don't.

06:44.142 --> 06:45.796
Okay?

06:47.407 --> 06:50.061
What's going on with Lorenzo?

06:50.105 --> 06:53.238
Babe, these are next-day
questions, okay? All right.

06:53.282 --> 06:57.678
It's midnight, so technically,
it is the next day.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.593
Spill it!
[shouts]

07:01.159 --> 07:03.335
[sighs]

07:03.379 --> 07:04.902
[whispering]:
Okay.

07:04.946 --> 07:07.122
What I'm about to tell you
got to be kept a secret.

07:07.165 --> 07:09.820
Okay, but why
are you whispering?

07:09.864 --> 07:10.908
I don't know.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.480
[normal volume]:
Lorenzo's having an affair.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.135
[whispers]:What?

07:20.178 --> 07:22.180
[whispers]:
Yes.

07:22.224 --> 07:26.707
Oh, my God, I can't
believe that jackass.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.361
Claire is gonna be devastated
when she finds out.

07:29.405 --> 07:30.885
No, she's not.

07:30.928 --> 07:32.887
Because she's not
gonna find out.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.497
At least not from us.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.846
Calvin.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.892
Tina.

07:37.935 --> 07:41.678
Look, now, I'm not gonna say
nothing and neither are you.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.158
Men,

07:43.201 --> 07:44.594
we live by The Man Code.

07:44.638 --> 07:46.640
Look, if I know
you know something,

07:46.683 --> 07:47.989
then I could tell you.

07:48.032 --> 07:49.904
But if I don't know
that you know,

07:49.947 --> 07:52.123
then I can't tell you, you know?

07:53.864 --> 07:55.649
Oh, I know.

07:55.692 --> 07:59.043
And that nonsense should have
expired when you turned 25.

07:59.087 --> 08:01.524
The Man Code is stupid.

08:01.568 --> 08:05.049
Well, if that isn't gender bias,
I don't know what is, Tina.

08:07.356 --> 08:08.531
Calvin,

08:08.575 --> 08:10.533
Claire and I go way back,

08:10.577 --> 08:12.361
just like you and Lorenzo.

08:12.404 --> 08:15.364
And I will be calling
her in the morning.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.505
Tina.

08:25.548 --> 08:29.160
You can't tell Claire
that Lorenzo is cheating on her,

08:29.204 --> 08:32.554
'cause you'd be breaking
The Marriage Code.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.688
The Marriage Code?

08:34.731 --> 08:37.559
Yes. It's sacred.

08:37.604 --> 08:43.347
Secrets between a husband
and wife have to stay a secret.

08:43.392 --> 08:45.133
It's in the Bible.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.616
It's Leviticus 3:6... Mafia,
or something.

08:52.140 --> 08:55.926
Yeah, but that does not
outweigh Exodus 20:14

08:55.970 --> 08:59.060
"Do not screw around
on your wife."

08:59.103 --> 09:02.106
All right, all I'm saying is
that we should stay out

09:02.150 --> 09:04.413
of other people's relationships.

09:04.456 --> 09:07.329
Agreed, but I live
by The Sister Code.

09:07.372 --> 09:10.114
And if Claire asks me directly
if I know what's going on,

09:10.158 --> 09:11.942
then I have to tell her.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.425
[phone ringing][groans]

09:18.209 --> 09:19.733
Oh, my God, it's Claire.
What am I gonna do?

09:21.038 --> 09:22.997
All right, now,
you can't tell her.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.956
I been knowing Lorenzo since
I was in junior high school.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.392
Give me a chance to talk to him,

09:27.436 --> 09:29.351
let him see if he can
make this right.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.832
But what if she already knows?
I got to pick up.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.398
Hello?

09:33.442 --> 09:35.879
Oh, a-are you okay?

09:35.923 --> 09:37.881
Oh, your car broke down.

09:37.925 --> 09:40.014
Ugh, that's great.

09:40.057 --> 09:42.233
I mean, not-not great. I mean,

09:42.277 --> 09:44.453
considering the news
it could've been, yeah, yeah.

09:44.496 --> 09:46.150
O-Oh, yeah, okay.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.804
Yeah, have it towed to the shop.

09:47.848 --> 09:51.415
And-and Calvin will be happy
to fix it in the mistress.

09:51.460 --> 09:54.376
I mean, the morning.
In the morning.

09:55.377 --> 09:56.508
Okay.

09:56.552 --> 09:57.640
Bye-bye.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.120
[laughs]

09:59.163 --> 10:00.730
Oh, my goodness.

10:00.774 --> 10:02.036
Look at my baby

10:02.079 --> 10:03.820
holding up The Marriage Code.

10:03.864 --> 10:06.170
Come on, now.Oh, yeah, it wasn't easy.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.476
You lucky you cute.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.913
I'm cute, huh?
[chuckles]Mm-hmm.

10:09.957 --> 10:13.351
Am I cute enough for you
to come on over here?

10:13.395 --> 10:14.614
Good night, Calvin.

10:18.269 --> 10:20.010
Y-You asleep already?

10:23.013 --> 10:24.406
Hey, honey.
I'm taking a kickboxing class.

10:24.449 --> 10:25.712
I'll be back in an hour.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.191
Okey dokey, hot and smoky. Mwah.Mwah.

10:29.063 --> 10:30.368
Oh, hey, Gem,

10:30.412 --> 10:32.196
you forgot your phone.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.329
[phone chimes]Oh.

10:34.372 --> 10:36.113
Text from Jameson.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.208
"Are we still on for 6:00?

10:44.252 --> 10:48.691
"Make sure to bring
that peach emoji.

10:48.735 --> 10:52.390
Winky-face emoji,
don't tell my wife."

10:53.478 --> 10:55.219
"Don't tell my wife"?

10:57.569 --> 10:59.615
This guy isn't funny at all.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.359
Maybe I'm missing something.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.013
Only one way to find out.

11:06.056 --> 11:09.233
[phone chirping]Nope.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.887
What, did she change
her password?

11:10.931 --> 11:12.759
Let me try her face.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.284
[phone chirping]

11:18.939 --> 11:21.202
[phone clicks]Oh, no.

11:21.245 --> 11:22.856
No, no, no. No, no, no.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.422
Ooh, don't lock, don't lock.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.424
Ooh, you locked.

11:26.468 --> 11:27.643
Darn it.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.560
Oh, hey, Grover, want to play
Candy Crushon Mom's phone?

11:31.603 --> 11:32.996
Here you go.
What?

11:33.954 --> 11:35.738
I-It's locked.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.653
What did you do?

11:39.002 --> 11:42.266
Nothing.
You just handed it to me.

11:42.310 --> 11:43.746
What did youdo?

11:49.273 --> 11:51.058
Hey, baby.Hey, babe.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.668
What are you doing here?

11:52.712 --> 11:55.889
Well, I am taking
you out on a date.

11:55.932 --> 11:57.934
You know, I've been thinking
about Claire and Lorenzo

11:57.978 --> 11:59.936
for the past few days,
and it made me realize

11:59.980 --> 12:01.590
how good we have it.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.810
Yeah, we do have it good,
don't we?Mm-hmm.

12:03.853 --> 12:06.203
Thou shall appreciate
thy hot wife.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.336
That's right.
[laughs]

12:08.379 --> 12:11.600
So what's wrong
with the cheater's car?

12:12.688 --> 12:15.125
A pair of panties
in the tailpipe?

12:15.169 --> 12:17.214
You know, baby, I hate
being put in this position

12:17.258 --> 12:19.564
by a two-timing, no good,

12:19.608 --> 12:20.565
low...

12:20.609 --> 12:22.176
...renzo and Claire!

12:22.219 --> 12:24.918
Hey, Calvin.Hey.

12:24.961 --> 12:28.878
Well, your car is fixed
and ready to go, you guys.

12:28.922 --> 12:31.098
Oh, Tina, I'm so
happy you're here.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.839
There's something I
wanted to ask you.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.318
W-Why do you need to ask her?

12:34.362 --> 12:36.799
You can ask me anything
that you need.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.540
Because it's a
question for Tina,

12:39.584 --> 12:41.673
'cause I know she'll
be honest with me.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.414
[laughs]

12:50.030 --> 12:53.250
Okay, so, this has been
bothering me

12:53.294 --> 12:54.817
since we hung out
the other night.

12:54.861 --> 12:58.081
Oh, thank God. You and me both.

12:58.125 --> 13:01.302
I knew it.
My pound cake was so dry, huh?

13:01.345 --> 13:02.694
Ugh.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.044
I think it needed more eggs.No, no, no.

13:04.087 --> 13:08.178
Actually, Claire,
your pound cake was great.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.876
And so are you.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.574
Lorenzo's lucky to have you.

13:12.617 --> 13:14.228
Thank you, Tina.

13:15.446 --> 13:16.708
So, what was bothering you?

13:16.752 --> 13:18.536
Ooh! Bae, Bae.

13:18.580 --> 13:19.886
Baby.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.889
[laughs]:
Tina and Calvin are so busy.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.760
We should probably
just get out of here, baby.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.545
Okay, but stop rushing me.
I want to talk to our friends.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.417
Okay, but we...
So, Calvin,

13:29.460 --> 13:30.766
CLAIRE:Calvin.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.855
So I heard you guys
had fun at the game.

13:32.899 --> 13:33.900
The game?

13:33.943 --> 13:36.076
Yeah, yeah. Stop playing, C.

13:36.119 --> 13:38.208
The Lakers game last night.

13:38.252 --> 13:39.253
The Lakers game.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.341
Ha!
Yeah, yeah.

13:40.384 --> 13:41.821
Yeah, the game was, uh,

13:41.864 --> 13:44.084
uh, it was a crazy game.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.302
You know what I'm saying?

13:45.346 --> 13:47.478
I drank a lot of them
$20 beers, though,

13:47.522 --> 13:51.178
so, you know me, you know,
I got the... all night.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.876
I ended up winning some money.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.182
I won a lot of money last night.

13:55.225 --> 13:57.271
And g-guess I got lucky.
That's me.

13:57.314 --> 14:00.056
Lucky, lucky Calvin.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.365
Calvin, can you help me
find Lorenzo's keys

14:04.408 --> 14:06.193
in the office, please?

14:07.237 --> 14:09.239
Looks like my luck just ran out.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.897
[knocking on door]Oh.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.377
[clears throat]

14:16.420 --> 14:17.900
[chuckles]:
Hey.
Hey, guys.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.381
Oh, hey.Hi. I need some help

14:20.424 --> 14:23.384
unlocking Gemma's phone, and
quickly, before she gets home.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.865
Uh, Dave, before we break
into your wife's phone,

14:25.908 --> 14:28.476
shouldn't you explain why we
breaking into your wife's phone?

14:30.130 --> 14:32.915
Sure. She has been
spending a lot of time

14:32.959 --> 14:34.395
with the school's soccer coach.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.527
She thinks this
guy is hilarious,

14:36.571 --> 14:38.181
but obviously he's no me.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.923
I mean, I'm the funniest guy
that you two know, right?

14:40.967 --> 14:43.752
Uh...
Um...
[stammers]

14:43.795 --> 14:46.755
Hey, you are the funniest
Dave that we know.

14:47.843 --> 14:49.453
Yeah-- Uh, oh, no. Dave Wilson.

14:49.497 --> 14:50.933
Oh, now, he is funny, right?

14:50.977 --> 14:52.630
He should do stand-up.

14:52.674 --> 14:55.068
Dave Wilson...Dave Wilson is a fool, boy.

14:55.111 --> 14:56.286
Oh, forget about Dave Wilson!

14:57.461 --> 14:59.811
Now, listen,

14:59.855 --> 15:03.032
Gemma left her phone, and I saw
a text from him that said,

15:03.076 --> 15:05.339
"Bring that peach emoji,"

15:05.382 --> 15:07.384
and then, "Don't
tell my wife."

15:08.385 --> 15:10.561
What does the peach emoji
even mean?

15:10.605 --> 15:12.128
BOTH:
Oh...

15:12.172 --> 15:13.695
Uh...
So...

15:13.738 --> 15:16.524
Well, uh, well,
in-in the ever-evolving parlance

15:16.567 --> 15:18.308
of young folks,
it is generally associated

15:18.352 --> 15:20.484
with the gluteus maximus.

15:21.790 --> 15:24.706
"That ass," Dave.
It means "that ass."

15:24.749 --> 15:25.925
It means "that ass"?

15:25.968 --> 15:27.665
Yeah.Hey, hey, hey.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.102
There must be some
misunderstanding.

15:29.145 --> 15:30.973
Gemma would never
step out on you, man.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.540
I know that, but if she finds
out that I was snooping,

15:32.583 --> 15:34.324
then she's gonna think
that I don't trust her,

15:34.368 --> 15:35.630
and then she won't trust me.

15:35.673 --> 15:36.500
And then the next thing
you know,

15:36.544 --> 15:37.675
she's hiding assets overseas

15:37.719 --> 15:38.981
and I'm picking up Grover
on weekends.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.201
Okay, don't worry, Dave.

15:41.244 --> 15:43.943
You got the power of the
U.S. government on your side.

15:45.640 --> 15:49.339
This is high-tech equipment
used to debug the Mars rover,

15:49.383 --> 15:52.255
but now I can finally use it
for something important.

15:52.299 --> 15:53.561
All right.

15:54.388 --> 15:55.955
Oh! Oh...

15:58.087 --> 15:59.436
Did it work?

16:02.396 --> 16:04.006
I can't believe you lied

16:04.050 --> 16:05.529
for that cheating Lorenzo.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.705
Look, I didn't have
no choice, Tina.

16:07.749 --> 16:10.099
All right? We've always
had each other's back.

16:10.143 --> 16:13.363
What kind of man would I be
if I sold out my oldest friend?

16:13.407 --> 16:16.540
The kind of man
who does the right thing,

16:16.584 --> 16:17.889
even when it's hard.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.589
Yo, everything good in here?

16:23.417 --> 16:25.071
Calvin will fill you in.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.078
[sighs]

16:34.080 --> 16:35.385
So, she knows, doesn't she?

16:35.429 --> 16:38.127
Tina's not your problem.
Claire is.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.564
Why didn't you pick up on
the Lakers thing quicker, man?

16:40.608 --> 16:43.741
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I not
lie fast enough for you?

16:43.785 --> 16:46.179
It was bad enough
you pulled me into your mess,

16:46.222 --> 16:49.095
but now you messing up my thing.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.836
So, you're gonna
blow up my spot?

16:51.880 --> 16:53.838
You blew up your spot.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.840
Man, you got Claire out here
looking stupid,

16:55.884 --> 16:58.060
and we both know
she doesn't deserve that.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.409
You need to fix this.

16:59.453 --> 17:01.063
Fix what?

17:01.107 --> 17:03.892
Okay, now you testing
my patience.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.026
Okay. Look, Claire. If you...These are not mine.
They're not mine.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.592
They're not mine, Tina.

17:08.636 --> 17:10.246
Claire, if you calm down...What's going on here?

17:10.290 --> 17:13.205
Oh, what's going on? I found
some hoochie's flip-flops

17:13.249 --> 17:14.945
under the front seat.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.949
You cheating on me!

17:17.992 --> 17:19.429
What?

17:22.432 --> 17:26.958
So you have been taking
other women to get pedicures?

17:27.002 --> 17:28.699
Look, Claire, I was just coming
out here to tell you.

17:28.743 --> 17:31.311
I'm sorry. I know
House of Toes is our place.

17:33.269 --> 17:34.966
Oh!

17:35.010 --> 17:36.707
Do something, Calvin.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.970
What do want me to do?
The lady's holding a tire iron.

17:39.014 --> 17:39.971
LORENZO:
Baby, baby, baby!

17:40.015 --> 17:42.104
Babe, please.
[exhales]

17:42.148 --> 17:43.410
We can fix this.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.107
Oh, hell no.

17:45.151 --> 17:49.720
And you will never see
these feet again, cheater.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.113
Don't do that.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.549
No-- Baby![metal scraping]

17:52.593 --> 17:53.768
Oh!

17:53.811 --> 17:54.856
[shouts]

17:59.861 --> 18:02.124
Uh...

18:02.168 --> 18:04.170
That divorce is
gonna cost you,

18:04.213 --> 18:06.041
but not as much
as this paint job.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.788
Luckily, I just needed
to flip the breaker.

18:13.831 --> 18:16.704
Yeah, unfortunately, this is
gonna need a lot more help.

18:16.747 --> 18:17.966
[sighs]

18:19.141 --> 18:21.535
I'm never gonna
recover from this.

18:21.578 --> 18:24.538
Time to start looking into
high-powered divorce attorneys.

18:24.581 --> 18:26.148
[knocking on door]Ooh.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.672
[laughs]
H-Hey, Gemma.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.587
Oh! Gemma. Gemma.

18:30.631 --> 18:31.980
Uh, the gem who's a ma.

18:32.937 --> 18:34.156
The ma who is a gem.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.636
Come here, my precious stone.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.246
Oh, okay.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.944
Uh, for some reason,
my tablet said my phone is here.

18:39.988 --> 18:40.989
Oh...

18:41.032 --> 18:42.033
And why does it look like

18:42.077 --> 18:43.209
your mom's banana bread?

18:49.954 --> 18:51.173
So, I'm gonna go.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.262
Uh, y-you two enjoy
our lovely home.

18:53.306 --> 18:54.916
And remember,
checkout's at 11:00.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.483
[door closes]

18:56.526 --> 18:58.441
[laughs]

18:58.485 --> 19:00.182
Uh... Gemma.

19:00.226 --> 19:03.751
Y-You are gonna laugh
when you hear this story.

19:03.794 --> 19:06.232
Dave, what's going on?

19:06.275 --> 19:08.277
Okay, look, to be honest,

19:08.321 --> 19:12.063
I saw a part of a text
from Jameson,

19:12.107 --> 19:14.240
and I know it was wrong,
but it made me a little jealous,

19:14.283 --> 19:15.632
so I tried to read the rest.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.417
And?

19:17.460 --> 19:20.376
Well, and he asked you

19:20.420 --> 19:24.206
to bring "that peach emoji,"
which any person hip

19:24.250 --> 19:26.426
to the ever-evolving parlance
of young folks

19:26.469 --> 19:30.343
knows means... "that ass."

19:32.954 --> 19:35.478
Dave, he sends me peach emojis

19:35.522 --> 19:38.220
when he's talking about
my homemade peach cobbler.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.962
But he's not supposed to eat it
because him and his wife Susan

19:41.005 --> 19:42.442
are on a diet.

19:46.141 --> 19:47.273
Well, someone
should tell Jameson

19:47.316 --> 19:49.144
what a peach emoji means.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.668
[sighs]

19:51.712 --> 19:53.670
Look, I'm sorry.

19:53.714 --> 19:56.456
All of this is because
Calvin's friend did something

19:56.499 --> 19:58.284
that just sent me into a spiral.

19:58.327 --> 20:01.112
Well, I don't know
what that's about,

20:01.156 --> 20:03.027
but you know you can
talk to me about anything.

20:03.071 --> 20:04.768
Yeah, I-I know that,

20:04.812 --> 20:07.684
and I should never have
invaded your privacy.

20:07.728 --> 20:10.252
It's just, you were laughing
so much with that guy.

20:10.296 --> 20:13.168
You even snorted one time.
You never snort with me.

20:14.909 --> 20:17.433
There's nothing sexy
about snorting.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.870
And I want to be sexy
in front of you.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.481
You know you make me

20:21.524 --> 20:23.352
laugh harder than anybody.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.093
You think I could do stand-up?Nope.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.880
But that's only because
I want you all to myself.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.971
And don't worry about Jameson.

20:34.015 --> 20:36.452
I could never do the whole
"Chris Hemsworth-looking

20:36.496 --> 20:38.715
soccer coach" type. Bleh.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.979
"Bleh" is right.

20:42.023 --> 20:43.198
[chuckles]

20:43.242 --> 20:44.460
Chris-Chris Hemsworth?

20:44.504 --> 20:46.332
As in, uh, Thor,
God of the Thunder?
