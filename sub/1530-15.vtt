00:01.480 --> 00:03.881
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.960 --> 00:05.564
- You saved Skye's life.

00:05.640 --> 00:06.687
What is it?

00:06.760 --> 00:08.125
Why aren't you happy about it?

00:08.200 --> 00:09.361
Being down there,

00:09.440 --> 00:11.841
seeing where I came from,

00:11.920 --> 00:15.845
I just got really scared that she
would suffer the way that I did.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.331
Agent Ward and I
have been having sex.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.448
- If it's a problem...
- I'll end it.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.330
I just gotta grab something
real quick.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.649
I'll be right back, my love.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.962
Hey, look at that.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.204
Hey, darling.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.164
Gal like you
could have any man you want.

01:04.239 --> 01:07.528
Why'd you marry that little dude?
He loaded?

01:07.600 --> 01:10.126
He's not my husband.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.851
I took him from his bride
earlier today.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.411
I needed him
to provide safe passage.

01:16.480 --> 01:17.527
You in trouble?

01:17.600 --> 01:20.649
'Cause if you need a place
to lay low for a while,

01:20.720 --> 01:22.290
this is as good as any.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.209
--Oh.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.566
What kind of beast is that?

01:27.640 --> 01:30.291
--It's a 1987 Heritage Softail.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.680
You can hop on mine
if you wanna feel it roar.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.365
Hmm, how grand.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.047
What is your name?

01:40.160 --> 01:42.083
My men, they call me Rooster.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.400
You have men?

01:44.560 --> 01:45.800
You are their leader?

01:47.280 --> 01:49.203
Last time I checked, yeah.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.006
Hmm.

01:54.920 --> 01:59.642
You and your men now serve me.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.362
- This guy bothering you?
-No.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.006
He's with me now.

02:05.080 --> 02:08.209
What? No! I'm with you.

02:09.039 --> 02:10.883
You said we'd be together forever.
Remember?

02:10.960 --> 02:14.248
I said we'd be together
till the end.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.840
It is the end.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.368
Who are you?

02:23.440 --> 02:24.885
I'm Lorelei.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.127
Now,

02:29.440 --> 02:31.886
introduce me to all of my men.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.808
- No! What did I say?

02:55.880 --> 02:57.769
Damn it. Every time.

02:59.120 --> 03:02.602
It's like you have a sensor for
whenever my butt lifts off the bed.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.648
- Back in it. Now!
-I just wanna stretch my legs.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.604
Look.
There's color in my cheeks.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.330
Breathing without

03:10.200 --> 03:13.010
feeling like my whole body's
on fire. I'm good.

03:13.080 --> 03:16.289
"Good" is not the appropriate word
to describe your state.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.689
You've been shot twice,
had your stomach perforated,

03:18.800 --> 03:21.007
and a breathing tube
shoved down your throat.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.128
"Better" is the more
accurate word.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.807
Again with the blood drive?
Not gonna have anything left.

03:29.640 --> 03:33.247
Not sure how I feel about
Dr. Simmons. She's so strict.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.050
Ow, and pokey.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.567
Well, patient Skye
is unruly and stubborn.

03:40.640 --> 03:41.687
And grateful.

03:43.760 --> 03:45.808
I hope you know that.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.331
I didn't do it alone.

03:48.400 --> 03:54.043
Still, I'm the most
gratefulest-est patient alive.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.846
--That's not even a word.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.921
Hey. This a bad time?

04:02.240 --> 04:04.641
It is if you're here
to bust me out.

04:04.720 --> 04:07.007
The warden
has extended house arrest.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.686
Awful accent.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.729
I must look terrible.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.924
Simmons won't even
bring me a mirror.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.161
I've seen worse.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.481
Wow, thanks.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.040
I mean, you look better
than when you were dying.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.371
- Swingin' and a-missin', Ward.

04:26.160 --> 04:29.528
It's great to see you better.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.601
I was so stupid
to go in there alone.

04:35.680 --> 04:38.206
Hey, there's no point
in doing that now.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.044
You were brave.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.451
Thanks to you,
every S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in the country

04:42.520 --> 04:44.204
knows Mike Peterson's alive.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.442
You tell them
about his magic leg?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.761
I didn't call it that, but, yes.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.767
Agent Garrett's running point
on Mike.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.968
Thinks he's part of
some project called Deathlok.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.725
He looked like death.
Should've...

04:59.600 --> 05:01.568
He wouldn't even look at me.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.121
They did something to him.
He needs help.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.571
He's past help.

05:07.680 --> 05:10.923
He was there with you, Skye.
Could've protected you.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.082
He let this happen to you.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.841
And I'll never forgive that.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.725
Well, I need to better protect myself.

05:20.240 --> 05:24.006
So... When Simmons gives
the all-clear, we'll start training?

05:24.080 --> 05:25.445
We'll ease you back into it.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.285
No. I wanna train harder.

05:28.360 --> 05:32.763
Next time, I don't wanna depend
on some miracle drug to save me.

05:34.280 --> 05:37.523
She's beginning to get suspicious
of all the blood I'm taking.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.809
No wonder. How many samples
have you tested each day?

05:40.880 --> 05:43.565
Not enough.
Not enough to find anything.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.404
In her blood or Coulson's.

05:47.520 --> 05:50.410
There isn't ample residue
remaining in the vial to examine

05:50.480 --> 05:53.211
after we emptied it
into her bloodstream.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.930
Such a pity you only found the one.

05:55.800 --> 05:59.361
Well, excuse me for not sticking around
long enough to get blown to pieces.

06:00.600 --> 06:05.811
It's just that the last sample of this
miracle drug is inside Skye.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.044
- You can't find any trace of it?
-No.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.043
She's healing
at an exponential rate,

06:10.120 --> 06:13.727
but I can't detect anything
irregular on a cellular level.

06:13.840 --> 06:14.841
And you've explained to Coulson

06:14.920 --> 06:17.321
that you need to upload
the samples to H.Q.?

06:17.800 --> 06:20.610
He shut me down.
Said to keep it in-house.

06:20.720 --> 06:24.122
I mean, this drug could be
a phenomenal breakthrough,

06:24.200 --> 06:25.406
could save countless lives.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.005
Why's he being so twitchy?

06:29.240 --> 06:31.163
You were down in the bunker with him.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.802
Did you see anything peculiar?

06:34.800 --> 06:37.326
Everything was peculiar.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.011
Director Fury
moved heaven and earth.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.925
No! Don't give it to her!

07:03.760 --> 07:07.048
You know, usually when a friend
wants a favor, they do something nice.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.727
Takes me to a nice restaurant,
buys me a bottle of wine.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.929
Wanna go to a movie?
Hold hands? Okay.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.446
But I need to ask you
a question first.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.284
I don't know
where Director Fury is.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.444
Don't be so shocked.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.887
For a quiet guy,
you make a lot of noise.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.325
How many favors have you called in?

07:25.400 --> 07:26.447
Clearly not enough.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.690
Something I can help you with?

07:30.520 --> 07:34.127
Fine. But Fury is a high-level
agent who's off-grid.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.124
You don't find him
unless he wants to find you.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.886
You did something like that
once, too, remember?

07:40.960 --> 07:42.689
I never asked you.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.205
How was Tahiti?

07:45.880 --> 07:47.484
It sucked.

07:52.840 --> 07:53.887
New orders.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.964
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s detecting massive
energy readings in the skies

07:57.080 --> 07:59.321
above the
California-Nevada border.

07:59.560 --> 08:00.641
Where's Agent Coulson?

08:00.760 --> 08:01.807
Taking personal time.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.811
That's a couple days straight.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.001
These are the same readings

08:05.080 --> 08:06.445
Dr. Selvig and Dr. Foster picked up

08:06.520 --> 08:08.249
in New Mexico and in London.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.849
They herald the arrival
of an Asgardian.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.331
- Thor?
- Not sure.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.165
Either way, S.H.I.E.L.D. wants us
to be the welcome wagon.

08:16.600 --> 08:20.082
Okay. Fine.
No cause for concern. Right?

08:20.920 --> 08:22.410
Asgardians are allies.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.291
Loki wasn't.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.046
Fitz?

08:40.120 --> 08:43.602
Uh, we're definitely getting close,
but it's a bit of a crapshoot.

08:44.080 --> 08:46.128
This is still science
we don't completely understand.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.567
Seems to be a lot of that
going around lately.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.003
So Coulson hasn't talked to you?

08:51.080 --> 08:54.527
About why he changed his mind
on giving Skye that injection?

08:55.120 --> 08:57.930
No. He's keeping it to himself.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.401
Whoa! I'm getting
a massive energy surge.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.050
Three times the level
of the one before.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.485
How close?

09:19.920 --> 09:21.968
Yeah. Definitely Asgardian.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.923
Running facial recognition.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.250
Okay, got it.
I don't have a name, but I can confirm

09:30.320 --> 09:32.448
she was in New Mexico
fighting with Thor and his mates.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.010
She's on our side.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.048
Stand down. She's a friendly.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.169
You are of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

09:38.920 --> 09:40.251
Yeah.

09:40.320 --> 09:44.962
I'm Lady Sif, of Asgard.
Your world is in grave danger.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.444
She's a warrior.

09:57.520 --> 10:00.126
I saw her fight
in New Mexico with Thor.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.521
Climbed a giant
metal killing machine.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.080
Speared it
with her double-bladed sword.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.491
It was pretty badass.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.125
She says she needs S.H.I.E.L.D.
to help her find someone.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.201
You up for this?

10:11.280 --> 10:13.123
I'm fine.

10:13.200 --> 10:17.125
Fine doesn't look like this.
Not on you.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.680
You've been gone
more often than not.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.642
Whatever's bothering you,
I'm here.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.085
I know.

10:34.360 --> 10:35.725
What dark magic is this?

10:36.200 --> 10:38.362
Thor said you perished
at the hand of Loki.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.011
And he was right.
For a while, anyway.

10:41.080 --> 10:44.527
But Loki wasn't the only one
with some tricks up his sleeve.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.841
Turns out S.H.I.E.L.D. had
a few of their own.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.489
Thor will be pleased to hear it.
He considers you a friend.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.766
I feel the same.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.690
Which is why I'd prefer
he hear it from me, if that's okay.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.605
I understand
you're looking for someone?

10:59.720 --> 11:01.848
I am hunting her. Lorelei.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.925
600 years ago,
she used her powers

11:04.000 --> 11:06.162
to wreak havoc
across the Nine Realms.

11:06.240 --> 11:09.164
To command armies,
bring down kings, empires.

11:09.240 --> 11:13.245
What kind of powers are we
talking about? Strength? Speed?

11:13.920 --> 11:14.921
Sorcery.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.403
She bends and shapes the will
of men to her own purpose.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.926
Only men?
Her powers don't work on women?

11:22.280 --> 11:23.725
No.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.770
Men have an inherent weakness
we do not share.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.204
I can't imagine
what she's talking about.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.760
The very sound of her voice
can ensnare most.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.604
For the rare man
who can resist,

11:33.680 --> 11:37.526
it's her voice joined by her touch
that will overpower his will.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.806
So how do we stop her?

11:40.640 --> 11:41.846
With this.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.882
It prevents her from speaking.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.566
She wore one like it
for centuries while locked in prison.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.086
She escaped when the Dark Elves
invaded Asgard,

11:50.160 --> 11:53.562
and came here using Loki's
secret pathways between worlds.

11:53.640 --> 11:54.721
Do we know where she is now?

11:54.800 --> 11:58.088
All I know is the Bifrost delivered me
to her last known location.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.401
Mostly small towns out that way.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.529
Let's start looking
for unusual activity

12:02.600 --> 12:04.568
within a few hundred-mile
radius.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.802
Burglary, theft, assault.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.645
If this woman's
used to ruling over empires,

12:09.720 --> 12:11.563
she's gonna be hard to please.

12:12.640 --> 12:16.281
I wanted gold!
You bring me paper?

12:17.520 --> 12:20.410
It's cash. It's like gold.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.007
This is the currency here.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.124
And who's this ugly woman?

12:27.400 --> 12:30.085
Uh, that's, uh, Ben Franklin.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.446
Used to be President.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.244
He used to rule this whole country.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.401
Hmm.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.851
And women can rule your land,
can they not?

12:40.920 --> 12:42.684
Uh, you'd be the first.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.401
Yes.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.201
I will.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.604
What the hell, Duane?

12:50.680 --> 12:51.920
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Move, move!

12:52.040 --> 12:54.520
I have been texting you all day,
worried sick!

12:54.600 --> 12:55.840
I thought you were dead
in a gutter somewhere.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.769
No, no, don't, baby.
There's nothing to worry about.

12:57.880 --> 13:01.362
I just turned off my cell phone, 'cause
the noise was bothering Lorelei.

13:01.960 --> 13:03.405
Are those my clothes?

13:04.640 --> 13:06.927
Why is this woman
wearing my clothes, Duane?

13:07.120 --> 13:09.043
Who's this Duane she speaks of?

13:09.120 --> 13:11.327
That's me. My real name's Duane.

13:11.800 --> 13:12.801
She calls me that.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.530
- She's my wife.
-Yeah.

13:14.720 --> 13:15.721
Oh.

13:19.280 --> 13:21.362
Do you prefer her to me?

13:21.440 --> 13:22.965
She's nobody next to you.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.088
"Nobody"? Really?
"Nobody" owns this bar!

13:27.720 --> 13:31.122
You know what? Everybody out!
Out! We are closed! Out!

13:31.200 --> 13:34.841
I'm tired of this noise, Rooster.
Make it stop.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.002
- His name is not Rooster! It's...

13:37.080 --> 13:40.243
I'm sorry, baby.
You're making too much noise.

13:43.560 --> 13:46.006
These are files
of every police report

13:46.080 --> 13:48.321
within 100 miles
of where you arrived.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.687
Everything from
the last 48 hours.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.489
When you wanna sift through
the information, you just...

13:52.600 --> 13:55.331
- I'm familiar.
-Uh, oh.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.768
It's an antiquated system
we and other realms had ages ago.

13:58.880 --> 14:02.441
You've visited other realms.

14:02.960 --> 14:06.009
Seen different species, aliens.

14:06.760 --> 14:10.481
Have you ever encountered
any that were blue?

14:10.560 --> 14:11.641
Yes. Of course.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.085
Which ones?

14:13.440 --> 14:17.001
Uh, lnterdites, Levians, Pheragots,

14:17.080 --> 14:20.209
Kree, Sarks, Centaurians.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.760
The Frost Giants tried to
conquer your Earth a millennia ago,

14:22.880 --> 14:24.609
but Asgard drove them away.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.530
Oh, thanks for that.

14:26.600 --> 14:30.161
And the others, have any of them
been here recently?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.207
Rest easy, Phillip, Son of Coul.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.887
None of the others have ever
visited Earth.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.562
There. A robbery of jewels.

14:43.080 --> 14:47.085
And there. A gun store robbery
by guys on Harleys.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.289
It's happening
faster than I feared.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.204
She's amassing men,
gold, weaponry.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.202
Lorelei is building an army.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.884
Traced the men to a biker bar
called Rosie's Desert Oasis.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.207
Probably where
Lorelei's hiding out.

15:01.640 --> 15:04.007
Meeting a S.H.I.E.L.D.
convoy there in 10.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.004
Good. Then you can show off
these beauties.

15:08.640 --> 15:09.607
These all Night-Night guns?

15:09.720 --> 15:12.724
Based on the same technology,
but we're not calling them that anymore.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.211
About time.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.611
They're called ICERs.

15:15.680 --> 15:18.047
Incapacfiafing,
Cartridge-Emitting...

15:18.120 --> 15:19.690
--They're great.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.650
And you lost the ounce.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.248
And I tripled
the stopping power.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.842
But I did realize after our run-ins
with Mike and Centipede...

15:30.920 --> 15:32.251
- Hello.
-Sorry.

15:32.320 --> 15:35.210
That we needed
something stronger. Better.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.684
I thought you didn't like guns.

15:38.760 --> 15:42.367
No. I always say
if I need a gun, I'll take one.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.204
We'll need these.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.682
When you're up against people
who are being controlled,

15:46.760 --> 15:49.843
sometimes it's hard
to distinguish friend from foe.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.843
This way we can take out either.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.649
Where's Lady Sif?

15:54.840 --> 15:55.966
Shall we?

16:06.360 --> 16:09.330
Lorelei's tastes run toward
palaces, castles.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.971
This is far more humble
than her usual abode.

16:12.040 --> 16:14.771
The draw wasn't the place,
it was the manpower.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.406
How many men
does she have in there?

16:16.480 --> 16:19.165
- Have you seen the suspect?
-Yes, we have.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.409
And she's beautiful.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.765
What is that?

16:32.040 --> 16:35.169
Well, it seems we've caught
the attention of the law.

16:35.240 --> 16:37.686
You swore to fight for me.

16:37.760 --> 16:38.841
Yeah, and I will.

16:38.920 --> 16:41.002
But they got a lot of
firepower out there.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.526
I mean, hell, they even got some
Medieval Times chick.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.046
She's got, like,
a sword and everything.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.000
Sif.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.243
They're on us from both sides.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.330
Pretty hard to get off a clean shot.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.285
Your Ladyship,
can you give us a little cover?

17:05.800 --> 17:07.529
Very literal interpretation.

17:07.599 --> 17:08.761
Thank you.

17:11.640 --> 17:12.641
All clear.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.127
Men, stay outside.
Let Sif take Lorelei.

17:15.599 --> 17:16.886
Ward, head around back.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.325
Surround the building.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.411
Lorelei.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.810
Still manipulating men
to do your dirty work, I see.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.884
And I see you're still
a step or two behind.

17:28.960 --> 17:32.407
You know how this ends, Lorelei.
So come willingly.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.448
You take me for someone
who fears you.

17:34.520 --> 17:38.241
I've bested you before.
Or have you forgotten?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.321
Tear her apart.

18:10.160 --> 18:13.801
Look.  I'm sure
you're a reasonable guy,

18:15.520 --> 18:16.487
Rooster.

18:16.560 --> 18:17.891
Rooster? Really?

18:38.040 --> 18:39.485
You're a fine warrior.

18:39.560 --> 18:40.891
I am.

18:40.960 --> 18:45.010
So put your hands behind your back
and get on your knees.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.321
Men kneel before me.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.684
I do not bow to them.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.129
I need some backup over here.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.881
That is not what you need.

19:04.560 --> 19:09.407
Take me somewhere grand.
Deserving of a ruler, a queen.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.243
I know just the place.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.641
Lorelei's treachery
remains unchanged,

19:19.760 --> 19:21.250
no matter the world.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.206
We'll find them.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.085
Every agent in the area
is out looking.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.003
To what end, hmm?

19:27.080 --> 19:29.731
The collar has been broken.

19:31.080 --> 19:34.448
Short of death, we have no means
to end her enchantment.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.648
Let me worry about that.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.006
Stay here.

19:39.080 --> 19:42.004
And try not to punch a hole
in my airplane.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.204
So Ward's, what,
like a pod person?

19:45.280 --> 19:46.850
No. According to Lady Sif,

19:46.920 --> 19:49.730
the men Lorelei controls don't forget
who they are or what they know.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.451
She just becomes the embodiment
of all their desires.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.407
So, once we find them,
we can break her mojo

19:55.480 --> 19:56.925
or whatever
and get Ward back, right?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.367
Yes. Once the collar's back
on Lorelei's neck,

19:59.440 --> 20:00.771
the enchantment ends.

20:00.840 --> 20:01.921
But that's the problem.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.367
The collar caught a shotgun blast
back in the desert.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.521
Think you can fix it?

20:06.400 --> 20:10.962
Well, the metal, the weight,
it's similar to the Berserker staff.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.566
But it presents its own set
of countless unknown variables.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.608
Got a couple hours.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.486
What can I do?

20:19.960 --> 20:21.246
And don't you dare say, "Nothing,"

20:21.320 --> 20:23.561
or tell me to sit down here
and count ceiling tiles

20:23.640 --> 20:25.051
while Ward is missing.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.730
Ward's got drop boxes
and storage lockers

20:26.800 --> 20:27.847
all over the world.

20:27.920 --> 20:30.446
They're filled with currency,
weapons, IDs.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.329
He's gonna use aliases, cash,

20:32.400 --> 20:34.767
anything to keep Lorelei
off the radar.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.849
You're the best radar we have.
Find them.

20:41.880 --> 20:46.283
Sir, may I have a moment?
It's about the GH-325.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.361
Have you found something?

20:47.440 --> 20:49.807
No. I've hit a wall because of
my limited resources.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.803
The drug's chemical properties
are foreign to me,

20:51.880 --> 20:53.962
which is startling
in its own right.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.041
We've been over this.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.407
So I'm requesting, once again,
to send a sample

20:57.480 --> 20:59.767
of Skye's blood
to H.Q. for further study.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.285
That's not an option.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.361
Why?

21:02.440 --> 21:05.284
I don't need to explain to you
the benefits of this drug.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.646
You've experienced them
first-hand!

21:06.720 --> 21:09.007
No. That's an order.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.485
That's not a good enough reason!

21:14.880 --> 21:17.486
I have a duty to you, sir,
as my commanding officer,

21:17.560 --> 21:19.528
but I also have a duty
as a S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist

21:19.600 --> 21:21.568
to pursue this, to save lives.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.608
Given Ward's recent situation...

21:23.680 --> 21:25.170
Two men laid down their lives

21:25.240 --> 21:26.969
in a compound
rigged with explosives

21:27.040 --> 21:30.123
to keep this drug hidden.
We still don't know why.

21:30.200 --> 21:33.010
Until we do, until we speak with Fury
and get some answers,

21:33.080 --> 21:35.811
that drug and its mysteries
stay in-house.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.645
Focus on the mission.
Lorelei has Ward.

21:38.720 --> 21:41.451
And we have no idea
where she's taking him.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.843
I am fortunate
to have found you.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.888
You are quite resourceful.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.689
- Just well-trained.

22:11.760 --> 22:16.322
No. You are worlds apart
from those men in the desert.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.765
I'm not an idiot.

22:18.320 --> 22:21.051
I know you value me no more than
those bikers back there.

22:21.120 --> 22:23.009
The truth is, I don't care.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.809
Because of what you feel.

22:24.880 --> 22:27.167
I've felt something before,
for someone on my team.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.850
It seems foolish now.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.604
I would die for you. Any man would.

22:33.920 --> 22:37.402
But I don't want them.
I want you.

22:38.440 --> 22:43.446
You're stronger. A real man with
the rage of a Berserker inside.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.727
You will present me with an army.

22:51.280 --> 22:54.966
And I will give you a gift
in return.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.328
When I first arrived here,

23:24.760 --> 23:28.321
I thought Earth
left much to be desired.

23:30.480 --> 23:33.006
But from here,
it's quite beautiful.

23:35.400 --> 23:38.244
I've spent the last 600 years

23:38.320 --> 23:41.005
locked away
in a dark, cold cell.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.370
My throat shackled,

23:46.320 --> 23:48.322
my voice silenced.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.451
Torture.

23:51.520 --> 23:53.488
You never have to go back there.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.289
But Sif is on the hunt.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.931
She will not rest,
she will not stop.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.447
I will not know peace.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.521
So we take her
out of the equation.

24:06.520 --> 24:07.646
Eliminate the threat.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.485
The graves of Asgard's enemies
are littered with men

24:10.560 --> 24:11.891
who underestimated Sif.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.168
Do not make the same mistake.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.322
You do not know her.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.887
No, I don't.

24:20.960 --> 24:25.284
But the people she's working
with now? I know them.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.763
May I?

24:46.720 --> 24:48.370
You have experience with swords?

24:48.440 --> 24:49.646
Yes.

24:50.400 --> 24:52.209
But I prefer to use my hands.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.164
Admirable.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.926
But be warned,
Lorelei is quite skilled at combat.

25:01.400 --> 25:05.246
Then why co-opt men?
Why have them fight for her?

25:05.880 --> 25:06.881
Well...

25:09.920 --> 25:11.968
I believe it gives her a thrill.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.286
Especially if the man
is already taken.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.522
And besides, even the best warrior

25:17.600 --> 25:19.921
needs an army
to conquer an empire.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.442
So, her pattern remains.

25:23.040 --> 25:26.681
She attaches herself to
the strongest warriors she can find,

25:26.760 --> 25:30.128
and then unleashes a swath
of blood and destruction.

25:31.520 --> 25:36.208
The man she's with, Ward,
he's as lethal as any.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.250
One of our best.

25:40.920 --> 25:41.967
I see.

25:44.840 --> 25:48.481
I've been where you are,
Melinda May.

25:49.640 --> 25:53.201
A man I cared for,
under her spell

25:53.320 --> 25:58.281
So enchanted, he forsook
his family, his friends, me.

26:00.520 --> 26:03.603
Steel yourself to do
what might be necessary.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.402
- Your Agent Ward...
-He's not mine.

26:06.480 --> 26:08.084
Well, that is certainly true now.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.687
But Agent Ward is no longer
the man you knew.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.485
He will not hesitate to kill you.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.166
Ward won't kill me.

26:16.240 --> 26:18.811
Do not let your feelings
cloud your judgment.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.166
I'm not.

26:22.840 --> 26:26.401
He might try to kill me,
but he won't.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.924
Security cameras
just caught sight of them.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.368
If Lorelei wants an army
of wealthy, pliable men,

26:36.440 --> 26:38.442
I think she just hit the jackpot.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.687
- Clear.
- Bedroom clear.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.041
Kitchen clear.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.601
Clear.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.045
She's gone.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.360
- Turn this suite upside down.
- Yes, sir.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.209
I know you said you and Ward
wouldn't be a problem.

27:10.280 --> 27:13.204
But I also know
you wouldn't tell me if it was.

27:14.560 --> 27:18.326
Fitz. There are cameras
everywhere in this town.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.890
Track 'em all.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.765
No sign of them in any
surveillance around the city.

27:27.840 --> 27:28.921
It was a long shot.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.611
Ward knows how we work,
knows to avoid cameras.

27:31.680 --> 27:35.651
Well, I expanded my search.
Got satellite support running.

27:35.720 --> 27:36.846
We'll find them.

27:36.920 --> 27:40.208
I do have a bit of good news.
I fixed Lorelei's neck collar.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.570
Let me inspect it to be sure.

27:42.680 --> 27:45.047
Asgardian metal is much different
from the ore of this planet.

27:45.120 --> 27:47.487
Sure, but I think you'll find
it's up to snuff.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.001
It's in your room.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.970
You and Ward
have the same training,

27:52.040 --> 27:53.610
cut from the same cloth.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.047
If it was you,
where would you run to?

27:56.120 --> 27:58.930
Asgardian metal is so dense,
just have to find the right tools, really.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.009
But you'll see.
Not a scratch on it.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.760
Because, yes, I am that good.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.771
Well done.
You really are quite clever.

28:25.560 --> 28:28.040
If I was Ward, I wouldn't run.

28:29.360 --> 28:31.966
--I'd take out my main threat.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.403
We're taking off.
Why are we taking off?

28:40.480 --> 28:41.845
- What is that pounding?

28:41.920 --> 28:43.001
I'll go and investigate. You...

28:43.080 --> 28:44.127
Stay put. I know.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.925
Someone locked us in.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.003
- Fitz!
-Sir.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.730
Ward and Lorelei are on the bus.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.086
Where's the collar? And Sif?

28:56.160 --> 28:58.447
In there.
That's why I'm standing guard.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.648
Would not want Sif to get out
and hurt Lorelei.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.444
Of course, we wouldn't.

29:04.520 --> 29:06.921
And Lorelei wants me
to go down to the basement,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.048
keep an eye
on the girls downstairs.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.406
Already locked them in.

29:10.480 --> 29:13.086
Cannot have them mucking up
Lorelei's plan.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.763
She's the best. Isn't she, sir?

29:15.840 --> 29:17.683
Yep. She's something else.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.684
Aren't you the brave one?

29:28.760 --> 29:31.411
You took my plane.
I want it back.

29:32.160 --> 29:35.846
Well, we can't always
get what we want.

29:37.520 --> 29:39.966
Actually, I can.

30:11.880 --> 30:16.647
I will retrieve Sif's sword.
it will look better in my hand.

30:16.720 --> 30:18.961
Ward, you don't want to do this.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.041
This was the plan.

30:20.120 --> 30:23.727
Cross off Sif, take the plane,
eliminate anyone in our way.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.682
Get out of her way.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.888
It's her plan. Not yours.

30:31.920 --> 30:35.129
Fight it.
I know you, you're a fighter.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.884
Is this her?

30:37.640 --> 30:40.450
The beautiful warrior
with a heart of ice?

30:49.600 --> 30:54.128
His heart now beats in concert
with mine, and mine alone.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.771
No reason to make this about us.

30:56.920 --> 30:58.445
Oh.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.451
He told me
who he desired before me.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.963
But, my dear,

31:05.440 --> 31:06.930
it wasn't you.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.651
Where's Simmons?

31:32.400 --> 31:33.731
- Oh.
-What the hell are you doing?

31:33.800 --> 31:36.326
Sir, are you you?

31:36.400 --> 31:37.640
Of course I am!

31:37.720 --> 31:39.961
Fitz has Sif trapped
in the Cage.

31:40.040 --> 31:43.408
We need to unlock the door,
get her out. What?

31:43.480 --> 31:46.450
Coulson, they opened
the airlock. She's gone.

31:46.520 --> 31:48.568
I'm afraid she was
sucked out of the aircraft.

31:49.280 --> 31:51.328
Are you kidding?
She's Asgardian.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.846
Sif's out there. Unlock it.
Let her in.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.763
You. Come with me. I need your help.

32:08.040 --> 32:11.010
Anything else I can do
to be of service?

32:11.080 --> 32:13.686
Okay, good, good.
I'll be right here.

32:29.360 --> 32:32.125
Leave me in peace.
Return to Asgard.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.841
While you remain here?
I think not.

32:39.360 --> 32:40.885
What's she doing? No.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.169
Here, I will no longer
pose a threat to Asgard.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.806
Can you not let me be?

32:47.680 --> 32:50.206
Find some small mercy
within your heart?

32:50.320 --> 32:53.324
My heart has no place in this.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.210
- I have orders to bring you back.

32:56.280 --> 32:59.204
All these years
and you're still the same Sif.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.449
Doing as you're told.

33:01.520 --> 33:05.002
Heeling at the feet
of those who command you.

33:05.080 --> 33:07.321
Never to get what you desire?

33:07.400 --> 33:09.209
Not Haldorr.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.961
Not Thor,

33:14.080 --> 33:16.481
a man who considers you
more pet than woman.

33:16.560 --> 33:20.007
Hand me my sword, Lorelei.

33:20.080 --> 33:22.082
See, there's the difference
between you and I.

33:23.320 --> 33:25.448
I don't take orders.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.765
Stay strong for me, baby girl.
You stay strong.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.410
Simmons. You're not supposed to
be up here.

33:41.480 --> 33:44.324
Ward? I think
we have a big problem!

33:49.960 --> 33:51.086
Ah!

34:01.200 --> 34:03.965
You better get back here, Simmons.
You cannot be running about.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.405
Okay? Lorelei does not want any...

34:05.520 --> 34:06.851
- Fitz.
-Sir?

34:09.760 --> 34:13.481
Poor thing. He's always getting
knocked out, isn't he?

34:31.880 --> 34:32.880
Ah!

34:52.000 --> 34:53.684
Kill me.

34:54.159 --> 34:57.289
I'd rather die
than go back to that place.

34:58.240 --> 35:00.083
You will not get off that easy.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.361
Why?

35:02.160 --> 35:03.650
It's what you want.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.289
I can see it in your eyes.

35:08.240 --> 35:12.006
Or would you rather hear about
how the man you loved

35:12.080 --> 35:14.048
followed me around like a dog?

35:15.280 --> 35:20.764
Hear of his touch, his kiss,
the look in his eyes when I...

35:26.520 --> 35:28.841
You were saying?

35:31.720 --> 35:33.688
- Sorry about this.

35:37.160 --> 35:40.243
Whoa! Wait, wait, wait. Sorry.

35:41.240 --> 35:44.244
It's me. Okay? I'm back.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.729
He speaks the truth.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.566
Good to know.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.206
My apologies.

35:55.680 --> 35:58.445
The damage caused to your
flying boat was unfortunate.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.851
It's seen worse.

35:59.920 --> 36:00.967
I assure you,

36:01.040 --> 36:02.883
Lorelei will be
punished severely

36:02.960 --> 36:04.962
for the crimes
against your people.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.088
It must've been hard for you.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.367
After everything she did.

36:09.440 --> 36:12.171
To move past it, to let it go.

36:13.880 --> 36:17.043
Odin ordered her back alive.

36:17.120 --> 36:21.523
As one of his warriors,
I bow to his will.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.887
Regardless of what it cost you?

36:25.160 --> 36:28.607
Much like your S.H.I.E.L.D.,
we are bound by our code.

36:32.120 --> 36:35.408
I am honored
to have fought by your side.

36:44.560 --> 36:48.804
I'll run diagnostics. See how
much damage we're dealing with.

36:49.400 --> 36:51.528
How much are you dealing with?

36:54.800 --> 36:56.404
He didn't break anything, so...

36:56.480 --> 37:00.929
Not what I meant.
You should talk to him. Hash it out.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.329
Then you should take your own advice.

37:06.480 --> 37:09.484
You've been sitting on something
since the Guest House.

37:14.120 --> 37:16.771
If not with me, then with Skye.

37:18.440 --> 37:21.683
She deserves to know
what you saw down there.

37:35.640 --> 37:39.964
I figure, I'll let you
punch me again. Repeatedly.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.566
- Just, why don't you just...
-it's fine.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.563
It's not.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.324
I never intended...

37:47.800 --> 37:50.406
- I didn't wanna hurt...
-You didn't.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.562
There was never a risk with me.
I told you that.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.081
You did.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.886
Seems like we're done here.

38:05.760 --> 38:06.886
Okay.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.048
But if what Lorelei said
was true,

38:14.240 --> 38:17.767
you were more honest with her
than you are with yourself.

38:27.840 --> 38:31.811
I'm not saying you were weak.
I'm saying all men are weak.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.281
Sir.

38:35.120 --> 38:38.806
I understand why you had to
punch me. And I forgive you.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.002
Could I get a moment alone
with Skye, please?

38:41.080 --> 38:42.206
Yeah.

38:52.440 --> 38:53.487
I know that face,

38:53.600 --> 38:57.241
and something gives me the feeling
I should be sitting down for this.

38:57.320 --> 38:59.482
I've been looking for a way
to tell you this.

38:59.560 --> 39:04.726
Looking around for some answers,
something to help explain...

39:08.160 --> 39:09.446
But I don't have any.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.601
So...

39:12.200 --> 39:15.921
The drug, the one that
saved us both...

39:17.000 --> 39:20.163
When we found it,
I discovered something else.

39:21.680 --> 39:22.806
Its source.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.085
It was

39:27.160 --> 39:28.241
alien.

39:31.040 --> 39:35.170
Alien, as in unfamiliar?

39:36.680 --> 39:37.761
No.

39:42.520 --> 39:43.601
Wow.

39:44.600 --> 39:45.761
The minute I learned what it was,

39:45.840 --> 39:48.810
I tried to keep them from
injecting you with it, but I was too late.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.648
I'm so sorry, Skye.

39:52.680 --> 39:56.082
You were trying to save my life.
You did save my life.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.207
I was desperate to,

39:57.280 --> 40:00.329
and so I subjected you
to unknown ramifications,

40:00.400 --> 40:01.686
or side effects.

40:01.760 --> 40:06.163
I'm sorry to say this, sir,
but so what?

40:07.840 --> 40:09.365
We are alive.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.568
And you've had that stuff in you

40:11.640 --> 40:14.450
for some time now,
and you're okay, right?

40:15.200 --> 40:17.202
Plus you're not sprouting
a pointy tail or anything,

40:17.280 --> 40:18.770
so bonus there.

40:18.840 --> 40:21.969
I know nothing fazes you,
but this should faze you.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.489
We're completely
in the dark on this.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.085
That's where we live.

40:28.640 --> 40:32.565
I'm an 084. Who knows
what the hell that means?

40:32.640 --> 40:34.847
At least
we're in the dark together.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.205
Yes.

40:40.560 --> 40:42.801
But not for long.

40:42.880 --> 40:47.920
To hell with any protocols,
or any code I used to be bound by.

40:48.560 --> 40:51.131
We have a long list of questions
we need answers for,

40:51.200 --> 40:53.407
and we're going
after them ourselves.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.164
Well, if the team's up for it...

40:55.240 --> 40:56.571
No. No, listen to me.

40:57.280 --> 41:00.602
I trust them, but we need to
protect them from this.

41:01.080 --> 41:03.651
Fury went to dangerous lengths
to keep this under wraps.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.722
Lied to me, lied to S.H.I.E.L.D.

41:05.800 --> 41:09.247
This is a powerful secret.
A secret men died for.

41:09.360 --> 41:12.807
Until we know why,
we can't share this with anyone.

41:12.880 --> 41:15.724
For their safety, and ours.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.324
Got it.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.050
So what'll it be, A.C.?

41:24.080 --> 41:25.241
What do we go after first?

41:25.320 --> 41:27.891
The person responsible for this.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.722
And we make him pay.

41:38.320 --> 41:39.924
No. No, listen.

41:41.080 --> 41:43.208
I trust them, but we need to
protect them from this.

41:43.640 --> 41:46.325
Fury went to dangerous lengths
to keep this under wraps.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.522
Lied to me, lied to S.H.I.E.L.D.

41:48.600 --> 41:52.161
This is a powerful secret.
A secret men died for.

41:52.280 --> 41:55.682
Until we know why,
we can't share this with anyone.

41:55.760 --> 41:57.922
For their safety, and ours.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.129
Encrypted line secure.

42:12.320 --> 42:15.722
Agent Melinda May.
Update log 93.

42:16.800 --> 42:17.881
He knows.

42:18.520 --> 42:21.126
I repeat, Coulson knows.
