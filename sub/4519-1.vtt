00:49.649 --> 00:51.784
You fuckin' holding out on me?

00:51.786 --> 00:53.118
No.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.119
No?

00:54.121 --> 00:55.120
You're not?

00:55.122 --> 00:56.188
Let go of me!

00:56.190 --> 00:58.057
What are you gonna do? Huh?

00:58.059 --> 01:00.492
What are you gonna do?

01:00.494 --> 01:02.594
What are you--

01:04.131 --> 01:06.832
I can't breathe!

01:06.834 --> 01:09.301
Stupid, you are my whore.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.036
- You are.
- Hey!

01:16.343 --> 01:19.144
What the fuck you
gonna do with that, man?

01:19.146 --> 01:21.313
You know this kid?

01:21.315 --> 01:23.816
God damn if you
don't have balls.

01:23.818 --> 01:26.852
You're a fucking cripple, man.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.154
You can't do shit.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.423
He's fucking with me.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.825
You're goddamn--

01:32.827 --> 01:34.426
No, you're fucking
crazy, man. You're--

01:34.428 --> 01:38.263
Whoa!

01:38.265 --> 01:40.332
Hey, calm down, boy. Come on.
Don't get all worked up.

01:40.334 --> 01:43.335
Look, look. It's okay.
Look at that, huh?

01:43.337 --> 01:44.670
She's fine.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.371
I got my money.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.340
All right? Huh?

01:48.342 --> 01:50.676
Go to work.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.215
I fuckin' love you.

01:58.685 --> 02:00.686
You want to hear some muscle?

02:02.289 --> 02:03.622
Oh, yeah!

02:04.691 --> 02:06.692
Next time, bubba.

02:20.673 --> 02:23.375
You can put that down now.

02:35.221 --> 02:37.156
I have to go.

03:13.426 --> 03:15.460
Photographs don't lie.

03:16.829 --> 03:20.432
In a darkroom,
film comes to life.

03:24.404 --> 03:28.407
The filters and paper,
an image appears,

03:28.409 --> 03:30.642
capturing a moment in time.

03:32.213 --> 03:35.914
What happens before
and after that moment?

03:35.916 --> 03:37.683
That can unnerve me.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.219
Check the bag.

03:41.454 --> 03:42.921
Is it there?

03:42.923 --> 03:44.623
No, it's not.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.358
You think you're better
than us, huh, retard?

03:46.360 --> 03:48.293
And now you take a
picture of my girl?

03:48.295 --> 03:50.696
Only in the hallway.
She wanted to pose.

03:50.698 --> 03:53.232
You'll never take a picture
of my girlfriend again!

03:53.234 --> 03:57.436
Don't look at her! Don't even talk to her!
You got that, scumbag?

03:57.438 --> 03:59.438
Crippled piece of shit.

04:03.877 --> 04:04.876
Dad?

04:05.879 --> 04:08.347
Dad, I'm home!

04:26.666 --> 04:28.867
I gotta go.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.405
I'll see you later.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.067
Thanks.

05:35.069 --> 05:36.668
Bye.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.038
Hey, let me get
two packs of Marlboros.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.074
Get your sorry
little asses out of here.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.376
You think we're
gonna break the law?

05:44.378 --> 05:46.611
Hey, you see this?

05:46.613 --> 05:48.580
Don't you criminals
know how to read?

05:48.582 --> 05:50.582
It says you gotta be 18, see?

05:50.584 --> 05:51.883
What's your problem, lady?

05:51.885 --> 05:53.618
- My problem?
- Yeah.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.487
Oh, Charles, hold me back.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.356
I'm gonna get myself
thrown in the slammer again.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.557
You're crazy.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.592
Come here,
you little piece of shit.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.960
Come here! Come here!

06:01.962 --> 06:04.363
Man!

06:04.365 --> 06:05.897
Yes!

06:05.899 --> 06:08.667
Oh, there's only one thing
worse than little punks.

06:08.669 --> 06:09.835
What's that?

06:09.837 --> 06:11.570
Truck drivers who try to pick up

06:11.572 --> 06:14.072
pretty middle-age
convenience store owners.

06:15.908 --> 06:18.143
Hi.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.711
Hey.

06:22.949 --> 06:23.949
Your friend's here.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.617
Shh.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.352
Is a pretty little thing.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.889
Yeah, she's really pretty.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.090
Mm-hmm.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.968
It's, um, 25 cents, hon.

06:46.606 --> 06:47.939
You can keep it.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.410
Uh, thank--thank you.

06:51.412 --> 06:52.677
Bye.

06:52.679 --> 06:53.812
Bye.

06:55.615 --> 06:58.550
Hey, it's okay
to have a crush on her.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.751
Oh, Peg! Come on.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.653
No. Hey, I can tell, angel.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.825
Hey, Vicki!

07:06.827 --> 07:10.061
So the theme could be
anything you like.

07:10.063 --> 07:13.799
Well, let's remember to keep some
clothes on our subjects, okay?

07:15.502 --> 07:17.068
- Ryan.
- But, Mr. Sullivan,

07:17.070 --> 07:19.838
what if they want
to take their clothes off?

07:21.208 --> 07:23.608
Now if anyone wants
to enter the contest,

07:23.610 --> 07:27.646
here. Pick up one of these
applications as you leave.

07:37.657 --> 07:40.125
Just let me know. Just--No...

07:51.571 --> 07:53.872
I had the bat, and I was like--

07:53.874 --> 07:56.708
I was like, "Leave her alone."

07:56.710 --> 07:59.811
It was--
It was insane.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.247
Wh-What was her name again?

08:02.249 --> 08:04.049
- Vicki.
- Vicki?

08:04.051 --> 08:05.784
Yeah. She kind of like--

08:05.786 --> 08:09.254
Truck stop's like her--
Like her hangout...

08:09.256 --> 08:10.522
Hmm. or...

08:12.258 --> 08:15.794
You know, when I went out there,
I felt like a regular guy,

08:15.796 --> 08:19.931
I mean, like I did what-- I did
what most guys would do, you know.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.601
Hmm. Well,
actually, I think, uh...

08:24.170 --> 08:27.272
Listen, most guys would not
have done what you did.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.007
I'm proud of you.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.115
Well, it did feel pretty good.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.121
When I went back inside,
I felt like an alien again.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.834
Hey, Charles, uh,

08:55.836 --> 08:57.569
we are gonna have
to start talk--

08:57.571 --> 08:58.803
Stop.

09:12.184 --> 09:14.052
What do you want now?

09:15.955 --> 09:17.255
Oh, I just--
I just came by

09:17.257 --> 09:19.558
to just see how you're doing.

09:21.594 --> 09:22.827
Anyway, last night--

09:22.829 --> 09:24.629
Last night, I was--

09:24.631 --> 09:27.132
I was a little bit
out of control, huh?

09:27.134 --> 09:29.768
Yeah. You were losing it.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.736
Yeah.

09:32.772 --> 09:33.805
Can I come in?

09:33.807 --> 09:35.540
No.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.370
What you fucking thinking?

09:42.848 --> 09:43.848
I'm sorry.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.550
What do you want?

09:48.921 --> 09:50.922
I don't know.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.158
I just want to make up.

09:56.729 --> 09:59.230
Can we just kiss
and make up now?

10:01.601 --> 10:02.601
Come on.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.135
We're good, okay?

10:04.137 --> 10:05.136
Mm-hmm.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.072
I'm good.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.173
Hmm? Yeah.

10:08.175 --> 10:11.176
You want to get a beer? Yeah?

10:11.178 --> 10:13.678
- Can I get you a beer?
- Yeah.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.647
Okay.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.730
You know I could take
all this away from you, right?

10:34.166 --> 10:36.334
Yeah. Yeah, I know that.

10:40.072 --> 10:42.807
But then what
would I do without you?

10:42.809 --> 10:45.076
I don't know. I don't know.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.428
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.367
Oh, angel, have I ever told you

11:09.369 --> 11:11.136
how much I love making coffee?

11:11.138 --> 11:13.271
Yeah, only about
a million times.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.674
I have got it down to a science.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.842
One rounded tablespoon per cup.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.811
Not mug, cup.

11:19.813 --> 11:22.047
And I only use this tablespoon.

11:22.049 --> 11:25.083
You should throw that thing
out or at least wash it.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.317
Someone's gonna get sick.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.386
Darlin', have you
lost your mind?

11:28.388 --> 11:30.855
This here is Grammy Ev's
sterling silver,

11:30.857 --> 11:33.925
and it makes the perfect
cup, and you know it,

11:33.927 --> 11:36.961
because you love
my coffee. Admit it!

11:36.963 --> 11:38.463
I know. I know.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.699
It'd be easier just to
pour in the grounds.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.702
Well, speed's not gonna
make it turn out good.

11:43.704 --> 11:46.171
Anyway, this is an art,
believe me.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.406
You've had
your dad's coffee, right?

11:48.408 --> 11:51.142
Ugh. It's worse than Sanka.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.244
Well, hello.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.946
Look who's here. You know,

11:54.948 --> 11:57.148
some men just can't take a hint

11:57.150 --> 12:00.685
that a lady is not interested.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.089
Heh. Hey, there, Charles.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.824
Hey, Jack.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.926
Hello, sunshine.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.294
Now, Jack...

12:09.296 --> 12:10.295
She'll come around.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.263
I hope so.

12:12.265 --> 12:16.234
Is that Jack Campbell trying
to act all sweet again?

12:16.236 --> 12:18.870
Ooh. Ho ho.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.206
Now, there are
those crystal-green eyes

12:21.208 --> 12:24.943
that I have been just dreaming
about since Jacksonville.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.065
They're hazel, actually.

12:27.446 --> 12:28.813
For you, ma'am.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.815
Oh, roses. How imaginative.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.951
There you go.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.353
Boy, you are one tough cookie.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.155
You know that, sunshine?

12:37.157 --> 12:39.858
You know, you can buy me all
the flowers in California.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.726
I'm still not
going out with you.

12:43.429 --> 12:47.398
Jack, I have learned a
few things in my life.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.399
Have you, now?

12:48.401 --> 12:49.434
Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.069
20 years as a hairdresser,

12:51.071 --> 12:53.371
I think, qualifies me
as an expert on people.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.073
- I like your hair.
- Three divorces,

12:55.075 --> 12:58.076
I think that qualifies
me as an expert on men.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.845
And one trucker husband
who dragged me

13:00.847 --> 13:02.847
to this shithole of a town

13:02.849 --> 13:06.184
definitely qualifies me
as an expert on truckers,

13:06.186 --> 13:08.419
so hit the road, Jack.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.221
One dance.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.290
Baby, you just
give me one dance,

13:12.292 --> 13:16.161
and I will erase every bad
thought you ever had about men.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.428
Oh, yes, I will.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.429
That's right, Charles.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.498
Ooh, like a cat.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.433
Light on my feet, baby. No.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.236
Look at these moves, huh, baby.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.372
A little dip right there.

13:27.374 --> 13:30.074
Oh, yeah, I may be stocky,

13:30.076 --> 13:33.378
but I am agile.

13:45.591 --> 13:46.591
Hi.

13:46.593 --> 13:47.992
Hi.

13:49.061 --> 13:52.831
It's a quiet night, huh?

13:52.833 --> 13:55.099
Yeah. Um...

13:55.101 --> 13:57.602
it's pretty late.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.371
Yeah.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.507
You want a cup of coffee?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.409
Sure.

14:06.045 --> 14:08.947
Half and half
with three sugars, please.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.263
It's perfect.

14:30.569 --> 14:32.370
It's really good.

14:33.105 --> 14:35.373
No, no, no. It's on the house.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.308
Oh.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.277
Thank you.

14:44.984 --> 14:46.517
Gonna go.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.086
Heh. Bye.

16:14.974 --> 16:19.143
So, did you enter that
photo contest at school?

16:19.145 --> 16:22.413
Nah. I'm still trying
to come up with a theme.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.183
Kevin always said you took
your best shots outside.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.185
I don't know. I'm not
even sure I'm gonna enter.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.320
I'm telling you, Charles.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.521
One day...

16:30.523 --> 16:32.724
- I know. Stardom.
- Stardom. Stardom.

16:32.726 --> 16:34.592
Hey, remember those--
Remember those shots

16:34.594 --> 16:37.362
you took of me
on my Harley with Kevin?

16:37.364 --> 16:38.563
Those?

16:38.565 --> 16:39.564
Oh, yeah.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.065
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.066
I still have those.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.002
Yeah, it was--Yeah.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.537
Oh, you used to love
riding, didn't you?

16:46.539 --> 16:49.707
Oh, man, I felt alive
on my bike.

16:52.277 --> 16:55.613
Yeah, I wouldn't mind
having that feeling again.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.185
Look, I am losing fuel fast.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.220
I might just--
I'm gonna crash.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.421
Okay? Mm.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.256
Time to get you to bed, cowboy.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.656
I got him. I got him.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.092
All right. Come on.

17:08.094 --> 17:10.627
All right. Thanks.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.396
You sure you don't wanna
eat something else?

17:12.398 --> 17:13.531
- No, no. Thanks.
- All right.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.700
Good night, Charles.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.300
Night, Dad.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.672
Careful.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.407
Cold.

17:33.252 --> 17:36.487
Can you believe Jack? I'm telling
you, I can't stop thinking about him.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.523
The man just never gives up.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.359
I thought you
were done with men.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.561
Oh, I--I am, angel. I am. I am.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.296
He's not gonna fool me.
Don't worry.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.365
They're all sweet and lovey
at the beginning,

17:47.367 --> 17:49.801
and then they turn into Mr. Hyde
right before your very eyes.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.669
Well, I don't get my
hopes too high either.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.471
Oh, come on. Don't say that.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.442
What? Girls don't like me.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.576
What are you talking about?

17:58.578 --> 18:00.311
You just haven't met enough.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.080
It's too early to give up.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.748
You gotta be old
and wrinkled like me.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.783
Then you can be cynical, okay?

18:05.785 --> 18:07.318
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.487
"Girls don't like me"?

18:09.489 --> 18:11.789
- Girls don't like me.
- Oh, come on.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.458
They will. Trust me.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.193
They'll knock down your door.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.161
- Right.
- They are.

18:19.231 --> 18:20.631
Yeah, right.

19:10.282 --> 19:12.750
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:12.752 --> 19:13.818
What's going on?

19:15.287 --> 19:16.554
Nothing.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.824
What's that?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.325
It's nothing. Just...

19:21.327 --> 19:23.828
Well, it looks like something.
Let me see.

19:25.597 --> 19:27.231
It's really nothing.

19:27.233 --> 19:30.134
I didn't know
you were a photographer.

19:31.203 --> 19:33.871
I'm--I'm not.

19:35.608 --> 19:38.376
It says here it's
a photography contest.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.549
It's just more
of a hobby kind of.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.584
- A hobby, huh?
- Yeah.

19:46.586 --> 19:50.555
So what are you gonna take pictures
of for your hobby contest?

19:51.957 --> 19:54.892
Well, I was thinking, um,

19:54.894 --> 19:57.628
if I do end up
entering the contest,

19:57.630 --> 20:00.398
that I would--I would do the
California lighthouses.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.702
That's cool. It's really cool.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.206
Yeah.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.974
One major problem, though.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.710
I--I really need
a ride to get there,

20:12.712 --> 20:13.978
and I can't drive, and--

20:13.980 --> 20:15.213
What if I take you?

20:16.782 --> 20:19.917
What? No, that's not
what I was driving at.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.686
I know.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.654
I want to.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.958
What about tomorrow?

20:26.960 --> 20:29.794
It's a Sunday.
I'm free during the day.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.896
Plus, I kind of
owe you one. Heh.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.232
Heh.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.399
Okay.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.270
Cool. Where do you live?

20:39.272 --> 20:42.840
Um, um...

20:42.842 --> 20:44.508
where do I live?

20:44.510 --> 20:47.812
Forest--Forest Road, the
last house on the left.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.349
Cool. I'll pick you up,
like, 11:00?

20:51.351 --> 20:53.217
Yeah. Yeah, that's perfect.

20:54.319 --> 20:55.319
Great.

20:55.321 --> 20:56.487
Great.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.722
Yeah. I'll see you at 11:00.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.690
Thank you.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.955
What kind of music you into?

21:32.558 --> 21:34.425
Oh, I don't really
listen to music too much,

21:34.427 --> 21:37.528
but I like everything.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.729
Country's pretty good.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.998
My dad played a lot of country.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.669
Sometimes I go to the Cowboy
Palace with Peg and her friends.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.504
It's that country club
down on South Street.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.005
- Yeah.
- Um...

21:48.007 --> 21:51.008
Peg knows the bouncer,
so I get in without a problem,

21:51.010 --> 21:53.511
and he didn't mind, 'cause
he knows I don't drink.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.979
You don't drink?

21:54.981 --> 21:58.349
I have enough trouble
walking when I'm sober.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.884
How old are you?

21:59.886 --> 22:01.919
17. How old are you?

22:01.921 --> 22:03.587
I just turned 18.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.461
I think country's cool.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.763
I prefer harder stuff, though.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.433
I went to a couple
of concerts with Skid

22:15.435 --> 22:18.002
before I realized he was
a complete lunatic.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.370
Yeah.

22:21.406 --> 22:22.640
Anyway...

22:31.950 --> 22:35.553
I haven't been outside in
the daytime for while.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.888
I usually like to sleep late

22:37.890 --> 22:39.623
and stay in till nighttime.

22:41.927 --> 22:44.061
Why don't you go out?

22:46.965 --> 22:48.733
I don't know.

22:48.735 --> 22:51.736
I don't want people to see me,

22:51.738 --> 22:53.704
what I look like and all.

23:04.717 --> 23:05.950
Want to take a look?

23:13.859 --> 23:16.160
Who's Kevin?

23:16.162 --> 23:17.528
My older brother.

23:17.530 --> 23:20.765
This is his camera
and his stuff.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.666
Where's Kevin now?

23:23.702 --> 23:25.669
He died.

23:26.171 --> 23:27.171
I'm so sorry.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.407
No, it's okay.

23:33.545 --> 23:35.513
What about your mom?

23:37.449 --> 23:40.651
My mom left when I was
only a couple years old,

23:40.653 --> 23:41.719
just started to walk.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.120
At least, tried to walk.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.989
Why'd she leave?

23:46.091 --> 23:48.058
Me.

23:49.928 --> 23:52.463
So it's just you
and your dad now?

23:52.465 --> 23:54.465
Yeah, my dad's great.

23:54.467 --> 23:55.833
He's like my best friend.

23:55.835 --> 23:58.702
He's always encouraging
me and stuff.

23:58.704 --> 23:59.970
It's cool.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.639
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Yeah.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.207
Sounds like a good guy.

24:03.209 --> 24:07.111
What about you?
Do you have any family?

24:07.113 --> 24:08.746
Um...

24:10.715 --> 24:14.752
well, my dad's gone, thankfully.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.787
And my mom...

24:18.623 --> 24:19.990
I haven't seen her

24:19.992 --> 24:22.512
since she asked me to
hit the road, so...

24:27.132 --> 24:29.033
You should probably
take the picture.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.001
We kind of have to go, right?

24:31.003 --> 24:33.003
Yeah.

24:56.194 --> 24:59.263
No, no, no! I am done
with men, remember?

24:59.265 --> 25:01.765
D-O-N-E, done.

25:01.767 --> 25:02.967
They're nothing but two-timing,

25:02.969 --> 25:05.035
always lying, sex-addicted dogs.

25:05.037 --> 25:06.704
I don't mean you, sweetie.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.072
Well, I'm sex addicted, too.

25:08.074 --> 25:10.274
You know that.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.842
Hey, hey! May I remind you

25:11.844 --> 25:13.777
that we are sitting
with a very young,

25:13.779 --> 25:15.179
innocent young man here?

25:15.181 --> 25:17.141
Please, watch your
fuckin' language.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.818
Charles doesn't mind,
now, does he?

25:20.820 --> 25:22.586
Am I right? Am I right?

25:22.588 --> 25:24.288
Like I was saying, guys,

25:24.290 --> 25:25.789
men are nothing but trouble.

25:25.791 --> 25:27.057
- Oh, oh...
- Listen to me, girls.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.526
I know from where I speak.

25:28.528 --> 25:29.927
Oh, honey, there are still

25:29.929 --> 25:31.662
some good men out there,
fine men out there.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.597
Still some good men.

25:33.599 --> 25:35.032
Well, I have met most
every man in this state,

25:35.034 --> 25:36.600
and I have yet
to find a good one.

25:36.602 --> 25:38.936
No! The entire state?

25:38.938 --> 25:40.671
Oh, she's exaggerating.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.840
You guys didn't know me
when I was younger.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.882
The entire state is
not an exaggeration.

25:46.612 --> 25:48.812
You might be telling the truth.

25:48.814 --> 25:50.614
Oh, let's go.
I wanna--Let's move.

25:52.818 --> 25:54.752
- Hey, Dottie. Dottie.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:54.754 --> 25:55.953
Did you forget to wear
your underwear again?

25:55.955 --> 25:57.688
Well, of course I did.

26:00.325 --> 26:02.192
Yee-haw!

26:05.764 --> 26:07.731
You okay?

26:22.013 --> 26:23.280
Dad!

26:23.282 --> 26:25.015
Dad! You okay?

26:25.017 --> 26:26.684
Yeah. Yeah.

26:26.686 --> 26:27.718
I'm all right.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.268
You have fun?

26:45.837 --> 26:46.937
Yeah, I guess.

26:49.674 --> 26:51.141
Did you dance?

26:52.777 --> 26:54.745
You know I can't do that.

27:35.020 --> 27:36.253
Hey.

28:00.812 --> 28:02.713
Ah, there he is.

28:02.715 --> 28:03.881
Hey, Charles.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.449
Hey.

28:05.451 --> 28:06.450
Hi.

28:06.452 --> 28:07.951
Hey.

28:07.953 --> 28:10.254
Me and your dad
was just hanging out.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.856
Yeah, Vicki knows all
about cars and Harleys.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.992
Cool.

28:14.994 --> 28:18.462
I grew up being kind of a tomboy.
What can I say?

28:18.464 --> 28:20.764
And I love your dad's
Chevelle and Harley.

28:20.766 --> 28:21.865
They're the coolest.

28:25.371 --> 28:28.772
I figured we could go
to a lighthouse today.

28:48.861 --> 28:51.995
Can't believe how patient
you have to be to do this.

28:51.997 --> 28:53.430
That's what I love
about photography.

28:53.432 --> 28:56.266
Anything, really, if you
look at it long enough,

28:56.268 --> 28:58.802
you get to see what
it's really showing you.

29:04.175 --> 29:06.143
You know what I think, Charles?

29:08.747 --> 29:11.448
I think you're like
one of your subjects.

29:11.450 --> 29:14.351
You've got lots of faces
of your own to show.

29:18.823 --> 29:21.058
Why are you so nice to me?

29:22.761 --> 29:24.461
Why shouldn't I be?

29:48.454 --> 29:49.887
I can't do that.

29:53.258 --> 29:54.758
Yes, you can.

30:16.247 --> 30:18.549
Okay.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.218
You did.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.286
Really.

30:36.835 --> 30:37.968
Whoo!

30:40.872 --> 30:42.406
I'm gonna take your picture.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.842
- No.
- Ah, come on, smile.

30:44.844 --> 30:46.376
Please don't, no.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.145
- Yeah, come on, smile.
- No, please, don't. Please.

30:48.147 --> 30:49.907
- Charles, come on.
- Stop!

31:04.429 --> 31:07.397
I think it's really cool
you're so into photography.

31:15.106 --> 31:17.541
I remember when I was a kid,

31:17.543 --> 31:21.311
after I found out that girls
didn't play for the Dodgers,

31:21.313 --> 31:25.148
I got totally into the news,

31:25.150 --> 31:27.184
and I started walking around

31:27.186 --> 31:29.920
with a tape recorder
and a microphone,

31:29.922 --> 31:33.323
interviewing my mom and dad
and my little sisters.

31:37.595 --> 31:40.063
I was really into it.

31:42.300 --> 31:45.168
I remember I wanted to be
one of those reporters

31:45.170 --> 31:46.637
that goes right into the scene

31:46.639 --> 31:48.399
of the crime or the accident.

31:50.541 --> 31:53.243
I wanted to tell
whoever was in trouble

31:53.245 --> 31:57.114
or whoever had escaped the fire

31:57.116 --> 31:59.950
or whoever's kid had disappeared

31:59.952 --> 32:02.452
that everything
was gonna be okay...

32:04.956 --> 32:07.958
that it was all gonna
be okay, you know.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.899
And what have I got now?

32:27.178 --> 32:31.014
Vicki, can I ask you
something personal?

32:31.016 --> 32:32.115
Sure.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.692
How'd you become a...

32:41.694 --> 32:43.593
Heh.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.262
Sorry, I don't know--

32:45.264 --> 32:46.730
No, it's okay.

32:46.732 --> 32:49.666
It's my life. Shit.

32:51.469 --> 32:54.137
Uh, well...

32:56.007 --> 32:59.543
my asshole father used to
like to take his bullshit out

32:59.545 --> 33:02.546
on my mom and me
and my little sisters.

33:02.548 --> 33:06.350
One day, he just disappeared,
never came back.

33:08.619 --> 33:11.755
I actually managed fine,
even when my mom

33:11.757 --> 33:14.624
was bringing a different
guy home every night.

33:16.294 --> 33:18.762
Then one boyfriend moved in,

33:18.764 --> 33:21.231
and he took a liking
to me real fast,

33:21.233 --> 33:22.466
so she kicked us out.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.368
He went his way, and I met Skid,

33:24.370 --> 33:26.010
and that's pretty much it.

33:40.651 --> 33:42.686
How come you chose
to take pictures

33:42.688 --> 33:44.755
of lighthouses for your contest?

33:44.757 --> 33:46.623
Well, one day I remembered
that Kevin and I

33:46.625 --> 33:48.392
had planned to do
a road trip one summer

33:48.394 --> 33:50.260
to photograph the
lighthouses of California.

33:52.330 --> 33:56.099
He really liked the idea of the
light guiding people home.

33:59.203 --> 34:02.706
Guess you could say my brother
liked helping people a lot.

34:04.609 --> 34:06.676
How did he die?

34:06.678 --> 34:08.145
Vietnam.

34:08.147 --> 34:11.114
Shit, that's awful.

34:11.116 --> 34:13.150
He was a hero,

34:13.152 --> 34:15.217
even won a medal.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.120
Wow.

34:22.326 --> 34:24.628
It's really cool
that you're doing

34:24.630 --> 34:26.329
this lighthouse trip with me.

34:29.266 --> 34:31.301
I think it's really cool, too.

34:44.581 --> 34:47.818
How's the project
going with Vicki?

34:47.820 --> 34:49.119
Okay, I guess.

34:49.121 --> 34:50.687
I got some good shots. Yeah?

34:50.688 --> 34:52.589
Vicki's been helping out a lot.

34:52.591 --> 34:55.759
Eh, Charles, you ask me,
I think she likes you.

34:57.395 --> 34:59.329
She just feels bad for me.

34:59.331 --> 35:00.464
Ah, come on, Charles.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.732
I see how she is with you.

35:02.734 --> 35:04.768
She likes being around you.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.336
I don't know.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.171
Sure.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.808
What grade is she in, anyway?

35:15.213 --> 35:16.713
She didn't tell you?

35:16.715 --> 35:20.684
No. We just talked about
cars and motorcycles.

35:23.254 --> 35:24.788
She works at the truck stop.

35:24.790 --> 35:28.291
What do you mean, "She
works at the truck stop"?

35:28.293 --> 35:30.894
She "works" at the truck stop.

35:34.365 --> 35:36.566
Are you okay with that?

35:36.568 --> 35:38.368
Are you okay with that?

35:40.705 --> 35:43.673
I think so.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.809
I like her.

35:48.679 --> 35:50.580
I like her, too, Charles.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.688
Stay away from him, Charles.

36:32.723 --> 36:37.227
Whoo! Whoo!

36:45.603 --> 36:47.637
It's the gimp.

36:47.639 --> 36:49.206
What's in the bag?

36:49.208 --> 36:50.340
Not your treasured camera?

36:50.342 --> 36:52.842
Oh, no.

36:53.878 --> 36:55.879
Oh, where you going, huh?

36:58.216 --> 37:00.183
Huh?

37:07.491 --> 37:09.793
Who the fuck are you?

37:09.795 --> 37:10.994
Who the fuck are you?

37:10.996 --> 37:13.430
Heh. I'm your worst nightmare.

37:13.432 --> 37:14.898
Heh.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.601
I don't think you know
me very well, do you?

37:17.603 --> 37:19.369
Let's go, Charles. Come on.

37:20.504 --> 37:23.006
Excuse me, girlie.

37:23.008 --> 37:25.875
We ain't done talking to our
friend, Charles, just yet.

37:25.877 --> 37:27.577
Right, boys?

37:27.579 --> 37:31.481
Now why don't you run along
before you get hurt?

37:35.519 --> 37:37.454
Charles is coming with me.

37:42.526 --> 37:44.166
Don't fuck with him again.

37:48.299 --> 37:50.333
I may not be the best shot,

37:50.335 --> 37:52.135
but I usually hit something.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.938
Even if it's small.

38:04.682 --> 38:06.783
That was great.

38:06.785 --> 38:09.552
That would have made
the perfect photo.

38:09.554 --> 38:12.889
You should have done your
project on high school pussies.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.029
Where'd you get the gun?

38:19.031 --> 38:20.363
From Skid.

38:21.899 --> 38:25.835
Heh. Wait. How'd you
get my dad's car?

38:25.837 --> 38:27.470
I asked.

38:33.911 --> 38:35.645
Hey, grab the wheel.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.614
What? Why?

38:37.616 --> 38:40.417
Grab the wheel.

38:40.419 --> 38:43.520
You can't drive a convertible

38:43.522 --> 38:46.656
and not stand and feel
the wind in your hair!

38:46.658 --> 38:47.824
Whoo!

38:49.428 --> 38:51.361
Wow.

38:52.963 --> 38:55.532
Okay, it's your turn.

38:55.534 --> 38:56.533
Me?

38:56.535 --> 38:58.601
Yeah. Come on.

38:58.603 --> 38:59.636
Stand up.

39:03.641 --> 39:05.508
- You can do it.
- All right.

39:09.981 --> 39:12.015
Yeah!

39:12.017 --> 39:13.783
- Raise your arms.
- I can't.

39:13.785 --> 39:15.552
Yeah, you can.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.389
Ahh!

39:19.391 --> 39:20.857
Whoo!

39:20.859 --> 39:23.493
Whoo-hoo!

39:45.950 --> 39:48.151
How long have you lived here?

39:48.153 --> 39:49.619
Like six months now.

39:49.621 --> 39:51.154
Skid set me up here.

39:51.156 --> 39:54.591
Mm, he likes to know
where he can find me.

39:59.797 --> 40:01.398
Who are they?

40:01.400 --> 40:03.767
Those are my little sisters.

40:03.769 --> 40:05.168
Cute.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.370
Yeah.

40:44.141 --> 40:45.408
Whoa.

40:47.945 --> 40:50.647
I'm--I'm so sorry.

40:50.649 --> 40:54.884
I didn't--I don't know
what I'm doing anymore.

41:25.517 --> 41:27.050
Community college is
a great place to start.

41:27.052 --> 41:29.085
I could take photography?

41:29.087 --> 41:31.447
Sure. Your photography
work, it holds promise.

41:32.957 --> 41:35.492
You think you could help me
with an admission application?

41:35.494 --> 41:36.893
Absolutely.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.862
You know, Charles,

41:38.864 --> 41:41.664
I am so thrilled that you are
starting to believe in yourself.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.766
It's just great.

41:43.768 --> 41:45.735
Thanks.

42:06.657 --> 42:09.859
You and Vicki are spending a
lot of time together, huh?

42:10.896 --> 42:12.262
Yeah.

42:12.264 --> 42:15.198
Maybe we should talk
about relationships,

42:15.200 --> 42:17.634
you know, boyfriend,
girlfriend stuff.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.202
Not now, Dad.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.004
Come on. Help me look
through these photos.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.943
Charles, we still
have to talk about

42:26.945 --> 42:28.978
what's gonna happen
when I'm gone.

42:28.980 --> 42:31.214
Wait. What do you think
of these two?

42:35.586 --> 42:37.053
I think they're great.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.688
Yeah?

42:38.690 --> 42:40.690
Yeah, these two are winners.

42:48.766 --> 42:49.899
Hey, sweetie.

42:49.901 --> 42:52.168
We were just talking about you.

42:52.170 --> 42:54.270
Were those pretty little
ears of yours burning?

42:54.272 --> 42:56.739
What were you saying?

42:56.741 --> 42:57.974
Go on.

42:57.976 --> 42:59.008
What?

43:00.978 --> 43:02.946
Well, uh, we were
all gonna go dancing

43:02.948 --> 43:04.714
tomorrow night
at the Cowboy Palace,

43:04.716 --> 43:06.249
Me, Charles, and the girls.

43:06.251 --> 43:07.850
Jack here can't make it.

43:07.852 --> 43:11.187
But, um, we all were wondering

43:11.189 --> 43:12.589
if you'd like to come along.

43:12.591 --> 43:14.657
It is so much fun.

43:14.659 --> 43:15.658
Dancing?

43:15.660 --> 43:16.893
Mm-hmm, tomorrow night.

43:20.765 --> 43:24.334
Okay, yeah. Sounds like fun.

43:24.336 --> 43:28.605
Really? That's great, huh?

43:28.607 --> 43:30.573
That'll be fun.

43:34.813 --> 43:37.180
You are a breath of fresh air.
You know that?

43:37.182 --> 43:38.181
No, thank you.

43:38.183 --> 43:39.248
This dress is adorable.

43:39.250 --> 43:40.717
You look so sweet, sugar.

43:40.719 --> 43:41.985
Thank you.

43:41.987 --> 43:43.019
Doesn't she look
beautiful, Charles?

43:43.021 --> 43:44.387
- Yeah.
- Girls,

43:44.389 --> 43:46.189
have you ever seen
such a pretty little thing?

43:46.191 --> 43:47.890
Never in my lifetime. Never.

43:47.892 --> 43:50.293
Vicki, angel, if I looked
like you 35 years ago,

43:50.295 --> 43:52.261
I would have found myself
a real man.

43:52.263 --> 43:54.397
Oh, you would have had
the pick of the bunch.

43:54.399 --> 43:57.200
It would still be
the best of a bad lot.

43:57.202 --> 44:00.136
I'd rather have that than the
slime buckets we ended up with.

44:01.306 --> 44:02.772
Uh-oh.

44:02.774 --> 44:05.341
Girls, do you hear that?

44:05.343 --> 44:07.710
Time to slow dance.

44:07.712 --> 44:09.012
Who do you guys dance with?

44:09.014 --> 44:10.680
Each other. We've
always wanted men

44:10.682 --> 44:12.348
who were as caring and
understanding as us,

44:12.350 --> 44:14.717
so half of us just
pretend to be those men.

44:14.719 --> 44:16.185
All right, who's wearing
the pants tonight?

44:16.187 --> 44:17.687
Me. I did it last week.

44:20.290 --> 44:21.391
Oh, my.

44:34.906 --> 44:36.739
For what?

44:36.741 --> 44:38.441
To dance.

44:38.443 --> 44:39.442
Me?

44:39.444 --> 44:40.810
Yes!

44:40.812 --> 44:41.811
Uh...

44:41.813 --> 44:43.012
Come on. Come with me.

44:43.014 --> 44:45.114
- Oh--
- What?

45:46.344 --> 45:48.077
I'll knock if you don't.

45:48.079 --> 45:51.013
Wait. Wait!
I'm not ready for this.

45:51.015 --> 45:52.782
Vicki, come on!
We're right here!

45:52.784 --> 45:53.850
No, no!

45:53.852 --> 45:55.718
No, please.

46:02.226 --> 46:04.026
Hi, Lois.

46:20.077 --> 46:22.345
Vicki, is it really you?

46:22.347 --> 46:24.247
Hi, kid. How's it going?

46:27.451 --> 46:29.352
Charles, these are
my little sisters.

46:29.354 --> 46:30.787
This is Sharon,
and this is Kate.

46:30.789 --> 46:32.355
Hi. Hi.

46:32.357 --> 46:34.056
Hi.

46:35.392 --> 46:38.961
So what are you doing out here?

46:38.963 --> 46:41.397
Um, I've been
helping Charles out

46:41.399 --> 46:42.899
with his photography project.

46:42.901 --> 46:45.935
We were just in the area.

46:45.937 --> 46:49.038
- Are you really a pr--
- Kate.

46:56.280 --> 46:58.047
So where are you living?

46:58.049 --> 46:59.382
Out in the desert.

46:59.384 --> 47:01.417
Are you coming home?

47:05.422 --> 47:07.590
How's school been?

47:07.592 --> 47:08.591
Fine.

47:08.593 --> 47:10.493
Yeah, it's okay.

47:12.162 --> 47:14.397
Well, it's--

47:14.399 --> 47:16.399
It's really good
to see you, Vicki.

47:18.268 --> 47:19.535
Do you mean that?

47:19.537 --> 47:22.038
Of course I mean that.

47:22.040 --> 47:23.339
Isn't it, girls?

47:23.341 --> 47:25.174
Yeah.

47:25.176 --> 47:27.143
Yeah.

47:52.035 --> 47:53.202
It's been--

47:53.204 --> 47:54.937
Well, let's see.

47:54.939 --> 47:57.039
We've known each other
for a few years now, right?

47:57.041 --> 47:58.074
Mm-hmm.

47:58.076 --> 47:59.475
Ever since I brought in

47:59.477 --> 48:02.144
my broken-down car into Sears.

48:02.146 --> 48:03.946
Good old Eric
fixed me up just fine.

48:05.550 --> 48:07.583
And then I met Charles,
and, well,

48:07.585 --> 48:09.218
he just completely
stole my heart.

48:09.220 --> 48:11.888
- Well, what about me?
- Eh, you wish.

48:13.491 --> 48:14.957
Nope, Charles is, has been,

48:14.959 --> 48:16.659
and always will be
the only man for me.

48:16.661 --> 48:19.095
Peg got me the job
at the truck stop.

48:19.097 --> 48:21.163
Oh, really? That's cool.

48:22.566 --> 48:26.636
Yep. Vicki, you know,
um, Charles showed me

48:26.638 --> 48:29.005
a few pictures
that he took of you,

48:29.007 --> 48:31.173
and I'm telling you,
you could be a model.

48:31.175 --> 48:32.441
Me?

48:32.443 --> 48:34.043
Yeah.

48:34.045 --> 48:37.046
You, you are
the prettiest little thing.

48:37.048 --> 48:38.981
You do photograph very well.

48:38.983 --> 48:41.150
Your eyes are beautiful.

48:41.152 --> 48:42.385
Yeah.

48:44.656 --> 48:47.423
I think you guys are talking
about somebody else.

48:47.425 --> 48:49.425
No.

48:50.160 --> 48:51.594
Hey, what about your parents?

48:51.596 --> 48:54.096
Are you close?

48:54.098 --> 48:56.232
Um...

48:56.234 --> 48:57.333
no.

48:57.335 --> 48:59.669
My mom used to tell me that I

48:59.671 --> 49:01.504
was a whole lot of trouble

49:01.506 --> 49:04.106
and that she didn't know how
to handle it, you know.

49:05.944 --> 49:08.010
I have two great
little sisters, though.

49:08.012 --> 49:11.147
It's--It's really great
to see you guys together.

49:11.149 --> 49:13.282
Yeah, I seriously
wouldn't have been able

49:13.284 --> 49:15.551
to do this project without you.

49:15.553 --> 49:17.286
Vicki, can I ask you something?

49:17.288 --> 49:19.255
Yeah.

49:22.292 --> 49:24.961
Dad, I still really don't think
this is such a good idea.

49:24.963 --> 49:28.130
Charles, this cowboy
is riding again.

49:28.132 --> 49:29.565
Yes!

49:29.567 --> 49:31.167
Just don't go too fast, Vicki.

49:31.169 --> 49:33.450
Okay. I'll keep it under 100.

49:34.072 --> 49:35.137
Will you be careful, please?

49:35.139 --> 49:37.707
All right. Okay, hold on,

49:37.709 --> 49:41.143
and get ready for the
ride of your life!

49:41.145 --> 49:42.445
Kick it!

49:45.248 --> 49:47.216
Yeah!

50:15.412 --> 50:17.380
Hey, Truck Stop!

50:18.548 --> 50:20.649
Come here.

50:20.651 --> 50:22.618
Come here. Sit down. Sit down.

50:22.620 --> 50:24.487
We'll--We'll have a little talk.

50:24.489 --> 50:26.422
We'll get to know each other
a little bit better.

50:26.424 --> 50:27.423
I gotta get to work.

50:27.425 --> 50:30.259
Work? Shit. Fuck work.

50:30.261 --> 50:32.194
They'll run your ass
right in the fuckin' ground.

50:32.196 --> 50:33.229
You know that?

50:33.231 --> 50:35.364
Come on!

50:35.366 --> 50:37.633
Sit down.

50:40.237 --> 50:42.772
You know I'm not
gonna hurt you, right?

50:42.774 --> 50:45.441
Just come on, and sit down.

50:45.443 --> 50:47.309
Hell, you might actually

50:47.311 --> 50:51.013
take a fuckin' swing at me
with that bat of yours.

50:55.819 --> 50:57.086
Smoke?

50:57.088 --> 50:58.087
No.

50:58.089 --> 50:59.455
Good.

50:59.457 --> 51:01.157
They'll fuckin' kill you.

51:03.226 --> 51:06.228
Where you live, Truck Stop?

51:06.230 --> 51:09.632
Uh, just up the road a bit.

51:11.301 --> 51:14.270
Damn.

51:14.272 --> 51:17.139
That's a long way to walk with
that twitch of yours, isn't it?

51:17.141 --> 51:20.042
I don't mind. I like walking.

51:20.844 --> 51:21.844
Can't drive?

51:21.846 --> 51:23.145
Nah.

51:24.848 --> 51:26.382
Where your parents at?

51:27.517 --> 51:29.518
They just let you

51:29.520 --> 51:31.220
fuckin' struggle along
like that?

51:33.790 --> 51:37.660
Um, well, my dad's kind of sick,

51:37.662 --> 51:40.629
and, uh, my mom's not around.

51:40.631 --> 51:41.864
Where the fuck she go?

51:41.866 --> 51:43.632
She left us.

51:46.369 --> 51:48.637
Fuckin' whore.

51:51.775 --> 51:55.478
What the fuck kind of mother
leaves her kid like that?

51:58.615 --> 52:02.651
You know, all women
are useless fuckin' whores.

52:02.653 --> 52:05.187
You know that, Truck Stop?

52:05.189 --> 52:08.791
My mom, she nearly starved
my ass every fuckin' week.

52:08.793 --> 52:11.794
Didn't even know
who the fuck my father was.

52:11.796 --> 52:15.464
She'd spread her legs for a hit
of acid whenever she could.

52:16.801 --> 52:20.269
I should have fuckin'
killed that bitch

52:20.271 --> 52:22.638
when I had the chance,
but I was--

52:22.640 --> 52:25.374
I was too fuckin' nervous
in those days.

52:25.376 --> 52:26.408
Now...

52:29.212 --> 52:31.180
I don't have
that problem, buddy.

52:35.552 --> 52:37.686
Mm.

52:42.660 --> 52:44.593
You know, Truck Stop,

52:44.595 --> 52:46.729
God damn, you and me...

52:48.198 --> 52:50.232
we're a lot alike.

52:50.234 --> 52:55.704
We get all the shit
that life has to give,

52:55.706 --> 52:57.773
all the shit in the world.

52:59.477 --> 53:00.743
Sad story, ain't it?

53:02.880 --> 53:05.147
How's it going, eh?

53:08.285 --> 53:11.353
Aw, fuck it.

53:11.355 --> 53:12.354
Good talk.

53:12.356 --> 53:14.924
Good talk.

53:24.334 --> 53:27.169
I want you to do
something for me.

53:34.244 --> 53:35.277
Close your eyes.

53:35.279 --> 53:36.745
Huh?

53:38.248 --> 53:40.482
Close your eyes.

53:42.519 --> 53:47.256
Now picture yourself
in your dad's car...

53:48.725 --> 53:52.361
Just you and me
flying down the road,

53:52.363 --> 53:54.663
not a care in the world.

53:56.299 --> 53:58.834
Now you're standing up
just like we did.

53:58.836 --> 54:00.836
You remember that?

54:01.504 --> 54:02.905
Great.

54:04.574 --> 54:06.809
Feel the wind in your hair.

54:08.478 --> 54:10.546
You feel free,

54:10.548 --> 54:14.717
completely, totally free.

54:20.658 --> 54:22.791
That wasn't so hard, was it?

54:26.896 --> 54:29.598
I feel really lucky
to know you, Charles.

54:31.601 --> 54:34.837
When I think about what you...

54:34.839 --> 54:36.839
have to go through every day

54:36.841 --> 54:39.908
to get to work or school,

54:39.910 --> 54:42.978
when I see you
using this camera...

54:47.484 --> 54:50.953
makes me believe I can do
something with my life,

54:50.955 --> 54:52.488
truly.

54:55.325 --> 54:56.925
Thank you for that.

55:07.037 --> 55:09.438
I'm gonna miss this,

55:09.440 --> 55:11.440
the lighthouses...

55:12.842 --> 55:14.576
coming up here.

55:20.917 --> 55:23.552
Maybe there'll be
another contest, though.

55:34.564 --> 55:36.332
Smile!

55:36.334 --> 55:39.468
No. It's about the
lighthouses, not me, Charles.

55:39.470 --> 55:40.736
Ready for your close-up?

55:40.738 --> 55:42.738
No. Heh heh.

55:47.077 --> 55:49.812
Remember that summer, Vicki?

55:49.814 --> 55:51.080
Yeah.

55:51.082 --> 55:52.448
That was fun.

55:52.450 --> 55:53.749
Sure was.

55:53.751 --> 55:55.784
You girls were such a handful.

55:55.786 --> 55:57.820
Did you guys hike a lot?

55:57.822 --> 55:59.955
Yeah. We love to sleep outside.

55:59.957 --> 56:01.957
Look at that.

56:01.959 --> 56:04.560
That's our tent. Wow.

56:04.562 --> 56:05.961
Yeah. That's where we slept

56:05.963 --> 56:08.430
every weekend when
we didn't go away.

56:08.432 --> 56:09.898
Yeah, it was great.

56:09.900 --> 56:12.501
- In your yard?
- Yeah.

56:12.503 --> 56:14.370
We couldn't get them
back in the house.

56:14.372 --> 56:17.940
It--Tent was like
their little home.

56:19.008 --> 56:20.476
Is that Dad?

56:20.478 --> 56:21.844
No, it's...

56:28.017 --> 56:29.385
What is your problem?

56:29.387 --> 56:30.853
My problem is you're a whore!

56:30.855 --> 56:32.755
You should shut the fuck up.

56:32.757 --> 56:35.090
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

56:35.092 --> 56:36.959
I know what you did.

56:36.961 --> 56:38.394
Everyone does!

56:38.396 --> 56:40.462
We just don't
talk about it ever.

56:40.464 --> 56:42.464
Do we, Mom?

56:54.043 --> 56:57.813
You really thought I wanted
to be fucking that guy?

57:02.986 --> 57:04.753
Deep down, you knew.

57:16.766 --> 57:18.400
You okay?

57:23.006 --> 57:24.740
It'll be all right.

57:26.609 --> 57:29.545
No! No, it won't!

57:30.780 --> 57:33.649
I should never
have listened to you.

57:33.651 --> 57:37.886
I went through all of that
shit, Charles, for what?

57:37.888 --> 57:39.488
W-Why?

57:39.490 --> 57:41.089
'Cause you wanted
to see your family.

57:41.091 --> 57:43.892
No, I didn't.

57:45.728 --> 57:49.531
I don't ever want
to see them again.

57:54.971 --> 57:58.540
I wish I could just erase
these past few weeks.

57:59.676 --> 58:02.044
You don't mean that.

58:09.853 --> 58:12.621
I only hung out with you

58:12.623 --> 58:14.590
because I felt bad for you.

58:18.161 --> 58:20.195
You should know that.

58:36.779 --> 58:38.914
Still no sign of her, huh?

58:38.916 --> 58:40.549
No. It's been three days.

58:40.551 --> 58:42.050
Did you go by her place?

58:42.052 --> 58:43.619
Yeah.

58:43.621 --> 58:45.888
Well, there ain't
nothing harder to do

58:45.890 --> 58:48.590
than face your ghosts, you know.

58:48.592 --> 58:49.791
I know.

58:49.793 --> 58:51.760
She's a tough girl, Charles.

58:54.063 --> 58:57.065
Now don't you let this
go getting you down.

58:57.067 --> 58:59.001
Come on.
Gotta have faith, right?

58:59.003 --> 59:01.036
You gotta keep
believing in yourself.

59:01.038 --> 59:03.539
You're a great kid, Charles.

59:06.109 --> 59:07.843
Just hope she's all right.

59:07.845 --> 59:09.545
- I know. I know.
- She--

59:11.881 --> 59:14.082
I know one thing.
She doesn't want to see me.

59:14.084 --> 59:15.651
Oh, no, you don't know that.

59:15.653 --> 59:17.219
This probably has
nothing to do with you.

59:17.221 --> 59:19.521
She said so herself.
I'm history.

59:54.191 --> 59:57.259
Stand by for news.
It's next on Channel Five.

01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:11.840
She'll be back.

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:03.992
Hey, Jimmy, you want a drag?

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:05.761
Sure.

01:01:05.763 --> 01:01:07.129
Go fuck yourself.

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:11.900
What's wrong, gimp?

01:01:11.902 --> 01:01:14.202
No bodyguard?

01:01:14.204 --> 01:01:16.304
Hey, how'd those photos
come out?

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:18.866
You take any naked ones of
that whore friend of yours?

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:31.153
Wow, pretty nice.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:34.423
So this is what you use

01:01:34.425 --> 01:01:36.425
to take all those
stupid pictures.

01:01:36.427 --> 01:01:38.727
You think you're so special

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:40.262
with your camera and shit.

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:42.864
Well, fuck you.

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:45.867
Oh!

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:47.202
- Pussy.
- Nice shot.

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:48.837
We're outta here.

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:20.028
Truck Stop.

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:21.496
Hey, buddy.

01:03:23.199 --> 01:03:24.466
How's it going, man?

01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:26.535
Great.

01:03:26.537 --> 01:03:28.770
Say, uh...

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:32.007
you haven't seen
my working girl, have you?

01:03:32.009 --> 01:03:33.809
No.

01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:36.978
I been looking
all over for her, man.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.080
Fuck if I can't find her.

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:49.491
Oh, God damn, yeah.

01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:16.985
We got like a connection, right?

01:04:16.987 --> 01:04:21.356
Like, kind of like
an understanding, right?

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:26.394
I mean, shit, man,

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:32.400
we know what it feels like to
have a fuckin' whore in our lives

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:34.636
and then wake up one morning,

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:37.939
and, poof,
she's just fuckin' gone.

01:04:37.941 --> 01:04:40.308
That's why.

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:42.177
Well, you know what?

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:45.180
I'll be God damned that
shit's gonna happen again,

01:04:45.182 --> 01:04:46.581
another whore abandons me.

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.049
Fuck that shit, right?!

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:49.284
Fuck it.

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.021
Hey, you--you'd tell me

01:04:53.023 --> 01:04:55.056
if you saw her, right, brother?

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:58.293
I mean, you wouldn't lie to
old Skid here, would you?

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:05.267
Skid, I--I haven't seen her
in, like, a week or so.

01:05:07.004 --> 01:05:09.371
Aw, man.

01:05:09.373 --> 01:05:11.039
Yeah.

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:13.275
You know what? You know what?

01:05:13.277 --> 01:05:18.413
Even if she doesn't come back,
I'm gonna fuckin' find her.

01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:19.614
Trust me.

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:23.618
We'll be okay, right?

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.086
Mm. Mm?

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:27.522
We're gonna be okay.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.294
You fuckin' hear that?

01:05:32.296 --> 01:05:33.461
No.

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:36.598
I gotta go, man.

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:52.113
Hello.

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:55.150
Hello?

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.400
You shouldn't be outside, Dad.

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:14.102
You're too sick.

01:06:14.104 --> 01:06:15.170
But...

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:19.007
nothing hurts today.

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:31.519
Here.

01:06:31.521 --> 01:06:32.687
Oh, no.

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:35.390
No, no, I want you to have this.

01:06:35.392 --> 01:06:36.424
It's yours now.

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:45.033
Looks much better on you.

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:51.406
You're a cowboy.

01:06:51.408 --> 01:06:53.608
New horizons.

01:06:55.244 --> 01:07:00.048
New discoveries ahead.

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:03.051
God has given you
such an adventure.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.354
Uncertainty...

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.591
is exciting.

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:12.660
Remember that.

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:19.467
Nothing to be afraid of,

01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:21.036
okay, cowboy?

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:26.741
You know, I'm so...

01:07:28.644 --> 01:07:31.079
very proud of you.

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:34.449
You've become...

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.686
a man.

01:07:44.693 --> 01:07:47.462
I love you, Charles.

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:51.032
I love you, too, Dad.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:57.072
Kevin...

01:07:58.607 --> 01:08:00.475
I miss him, too.

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:13.188
I wish he was here.

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:18.760
I wish he could have seen
all the photos I've taken.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:30.337
Can you imagine what
he would say if I won?

01:08:31.674 --> 01:08:32.740
Right, Dad?

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:12.779
Well, I thought everybody
was nice, didn't you?

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:17.417
Stayed too long,
but at least they came.

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.520
Do you have my smokes, hon?

01:09:23.725 --> 01:09:26.594
Always the gentleman. Thanks.

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:36.938
You okay, angel?

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:39.607
You haven't said two words.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:44.511
I'm all alone.

01:09:47.249 --> 01:09:48.950
No, you're not.

01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:50.318
You got me,

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.654
and I'd do anything for you.

01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:53.921
You know that.

01:09:53.924 --> 01:09:56.491
Jack here, too.

01:09:56.493 --> 01:09:58.226
I know. It's not that.

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:01.496
Well, what is it?

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:06.301
What am I gonna do now?

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:09.404
What do you mean?

01:10:09.406 --> 01:10:11.606
You're gonna keep doing the
same things you've always done.

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:13.441
You're gonna keep working
at the truck stop,

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:14.976
and you're gonna keep taking

01:10:14.978 --> 01:10:18.213
those beautiful pictures
with that camera of yours.

01:10:18.215 --> 01:10:20.848
The camera's gone.

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:23.785
It's gone? Wh-Where is it?

01:10:23.787 --> 01:10:25.653
Kids at school trashed it.

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:27.989
Oh, sweetie, come here.

01:10:29.359 --> 01:10:33.661
Oh, sweetie, it's okay.

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:35.763
It's gonna be okay. I promise.

01:10:47.677 --> 01:10:49.711
Now I'd like
to announce the winners

01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:52.747
of this year's Cheeboro High
School Photography Contest.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:56.818
The third-place winner
with his excellent entry

01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:00.321
of Beacons of Light
is Charles Decker.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.492
Congratulations, Charles.

01:11:04.494 --> 01:11:06.227
Thank you.

01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:11.566
The second-place winner

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:15.570
with Desert Sunsets
is Ryan Nelson.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:52.707
There she is.

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:57.378
I've been waiting for you.

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:06.487
Who you running
around with, baby girl?

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:10.591
Just some guys
down at the truck stop.

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:15.263
Yeah?

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.768
Where's my jack?

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:26.040
Can you give me a break, okay?

01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:28.509
I've been doing
some pretty heavy shit,

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:30.712
and I--

01:12:30.714 --> 01:12:35.049
I just need a few hours
to--to sleep it off.

01:12:35.051 --> 01:12:36.684
Please?

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:41.622
Okay.

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:46.327
But I want my money first.

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:53.835
Do you still think
that I stole from you?

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:58.072
I didn't.

01:12:58.074 --> 01:13:00.975
I swear.

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:03.344
I didn't.

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.720
Ohh!

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:16.758
How do you explain that?
It was under your mattress.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.593
- That's my cut.
- You just ran away from me?

01:13:18.595 --> 01:13:19.994
- Deserted me?
- No.

01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:21.596
After all the fuckin' shit
I did for you,

01:13:21.598 --> 01:13:22.764
like a typical fuckin' whore?

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:24.399
No. I was coming back

01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:26.033
and doing tricks for you.

01:13:26.035 --> 01:13:28.403
- Here's your money.
- Don't you fuckin' lie to me.

01:13:28.405 --> 01:13:31.172
I'm not. I am not lying to you.

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:33.141
You been wanting to leave me
for a motherfucking--

01:13:33.143 --> 01:13:35.042
Don't, please. Ohh!

01:13:37.414 --> 01:13:39.680
No. No. No, please!

01:13:39.682 --> 01:13:42.049
I just want you
to be good to me.

01:13:42.051 --> 01:13:43.718
Okay.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.120
I just want you to show me
some fuckin' respect

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:47.889
and make me some fuckin' money!

01:13:47.891 --> 01:13:50.158
Do you think
you can handle that?

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.759
Yes! I--

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:53.761
Do you think you
can fuckin' handle that?

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:55.163
Yes, I can do it. Do it, then.

01:13:55.165 --> 01:13:57.799
That's all I want!

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:04.939
Hey, Truck Stop.

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:07.542
Hey, my man.

01:14:07.544 --> 01:14:09.210
Is that you?

01:14:09.212 --> 01:14:12.947
Oh, God damn it.

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:15.716
God damn, is that who you
been running around with?

01:14:15.718 --> 01:14:16.984
No. No.

01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:19.454
A fucking cripple
from the truck stop?

01:14:19.456 --> 01:14:21.022
No.

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:22.657
What?

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:24.058
Charles, Charles,

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:27.595
Charles, you have to go, please.

01:14:27.597 --> 01:14:30.998
What are you doing, Truck Stop?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.033
Huh?

01:14:32.035 --> 01:14:33.167
Leave her alone.

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:40.041
I told you to stay
out of my business.

01:14:40.043 --> 01:14:42.043
I'm not fuckin'
playin' with you anymore.

01:14:42.045 --> 01:14:43.211
Charles! Whoa!

01:14:43.213 --> 01:14:46.714
You motherfucker.

01:14:46.716 --> 01:14:50.017
This is your last chance to
get the fuck outta here.

01:14:51.187 --> 01:14:53.921
Yeah.

01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:55.723
Oh, yeah.

01:14:55.725 --> 01:14:57.825
I can't let you
get away with that.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.494
No.

01:14:59.496 --> 01:15:00.862
What kind of a man would I be

01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:03.531
if I let you
get away with that, huh?

01:15:08.103 --> 01:15:10.238
Ah, man, I'll just
hit him again.

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.639
No!

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:13.074
Back away from me!

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:15.877
Aw, come on.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.516
Wake up.

01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:24.919
Wake up. Come on. Wake up.

01:15:24.921 --> 01:15:28.089
I'm just gonna teach you
a little lesson, right.

01:15:28.091 --> 01:15:29.724
Just a little lesson, okay?

01:15:29.726 --> 01:15:31.292
Okay?

01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:33.494
Don't!

01:15:33.896 --> 01:15:35.763
Don't.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:38.900
Don't.

01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:15.169
Hey. Hey, come on.

01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:16.904
Hey. Hey.

01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:49.770
Photographs don't lie.

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:54.108
In a darkroom,
film comes to life...

01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:59.814
capturing a moment in time.

01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:04.952
Sometimes someone
shows up in your life,

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:07.922
and you help each other
without even knowing it.

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:12.226
In here, I feel balanced.

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:16.697
And out there...

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.167
Hey, can I ask you something?

01:17:20.169 --> 01:17:21.602
Go for it.

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:25.006
You okay?

01:17:25.008 --> 01:17:26.340
Yeah, I'm cool.

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.210
I'll see you soon?

01:17:29.212 --> 01:17:31.312
Yeah, you'll see me soon.

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:38.886
You take care.

01:17:38.888 --> 01:17:40.388
You, too.

01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:41.856
And keep taking pictures.

01:17:41.858 --> 01:17:43.824
I will.

01:17:46.663 --> 01:17:49.030
- See you later.
- Bye.
