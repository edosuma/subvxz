WEBVTT

00:30.656 --> 00:32.115
Honey?

00:36.078 --> 00:38.454
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

00:39.123 --> 00:42.083
Yeah, I'm just fighting off
a stomach bug.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.376
I'll be fine.

00:44.128 --> 00:47.797
- Did he sleep OK?
- Great, as long as I was holding him.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.590
I can't wait for colic to be over.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.179
Hold on, Mikey. Bath time's coming.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.599
He lifted his head yesterday.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.103
Take the day off.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.022
I mean, you're sick anyway,
and you hardly ever see him.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.108
Or me.

01:07.943 --> 01:08.901
I can't.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.903
I've got a meeting with
Crandall's Kitchens.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.322
I think that deal's gonna close.

01:13.449 --> 01:16.117
They called about the car payment again.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.910
It's two months late.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.166
We're gonna be fine, honey.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.377
Enjoy your bath, little man.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.148
You know, honey?

01:48.901 --> 01:52.987
Honey, I'm not gonna go in.
I'm coming down with something.

01:56.825 --> 01:57.950
Honey?

01:59.161 --> 02:04.540
Kara?

02:06.710 --> 02:07.835
Kara!

02:14.134 --> 02:18.095
Mikey!

02:19.181 --> 02:20.306
Kara!

02:23.143 --> 02:24.018
Mikey!

02:56.552 --> 02:59.428
Four-week-old infant submerged
in a bathtub. Don't know how long.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.097
Non-responsive at the scene.

03:01.223 --> 03:04.016
- Get a trauma team for six.
- Obviously breathing now.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.102
Continue the Bodybox.
Stat portable chest.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.436
Caucasian female, 32.

03:07.563 --> 03:10.106
- Where am I?
Tonic-clonic seizure.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.901
- Brent, where am I?
- On one, two, three.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.487
- Where am I?
- One, two, three.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.739
You're in the hospital, honey.
You're in the hospital.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.117
Honey, Mikey's here,
and the doctors say he's gonna be OK.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.202
Hopefully.
He needs to be checked out by the NICU.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.912
- What happened?
- You passed out.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.831
- What?
- Mikey fell.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.667
- Has your wife had a seizure before?
- No.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.711
I can't move my head! I want to see him!

03:31.837 --> 03:34.046
He's right here, honey.
He's OK. He's right here.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.550
Tonight. L Word marathon.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.470
- You watch The L Word?
- On mute.

03:41.597 --> 03:42.722
I'll pass.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.474
Dinner with Cuddy.

03:46.768 --> 03:51.063
Still sucking up so she'll fund
your play space for the chemo kids?

03:51.189 --> 03:55.151
They really ought to save their energy
for other things, like crying.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.320
She's the suck-up.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.072
She asked you?

04:01.658 --> 04:04.577
She's smart.
She knows if she buys me enough alcohol

04:04.703 --> 04:07.163
my defenses just might be weakened.

04:08.123 --> 04:11.125
It doesn't make sense.
Unless she ran out of batteries.

04:11.251 --> 04:15.171
Hey. I'm recently single, she's single.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.674
You're too nice for her to like you.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.177
She's not needy enough for you
to like her.

04:21.303 --> 04:25.681
She's got an agenda, just not one that
includes an appearance by little Jimmy.

04:26.683 --> 04:30.102
I'll poll my peeps. How many of you
think that Cuddy asked...

04:31.730 --> 04:33.105
Or, rather, peep.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.274
Chase caught a case in the ER.
He wants us to take a look.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.361
Unless Chase broke his neck
falling off his polo pony,

04:38.487 --> 04:40.488
he had no reason to be in the ER.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.698
Cuddy put him on a two-week NICU
rotation.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.992
Patient had an unexplained seizure.

04:46.203 --> 04:49.121
Seizures are cool to watch,
boring to diagnose.

04:49.247 --> 04:52.667
What about Foreman? He needs to get
his malingering butt back here.

04:52.793 --> 04:53.918
He almost died.

04:54.044 --> 04:57.505
- "Almost" being the operative word.
- Hey.

04:58.215 --> 05:02.551
- How are you doing? You look great.
- Thanks. I feel great.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.932
Glad you're back.
Cameron makes lousy coffee.

05:08.058 --> 05:11.936
I take mine black, the way I take
my brain-damaged neurologists.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.354
Happy to help.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.986
- How are you coming along?
- Tell her everything's great.

05:20.112 --> 05:21.821
Neither of us wants to deal with
her guilt.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.489
- I don't feel guilty.
- Of course not.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.826
Hell, if people felt guilt every time
they accidentally lobotomized a guy...

05:26.952 --> 05:28.494
I was trying to save his life.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.122
Yeah. Your heart was in the right place.

05:33.125 --> 05:36.460
It's just his brain that's not quite
where it's supposed to be.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.965
- Tell her everything's great.
- It's true.

05:41.091 --> 05:44.635
No more left side/right side reversals.
Still some short-term memory loss

05:44.761 --> 05:48.889
and spatial processing problems, but
I'm trying not to be too hard on myself.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.975
Yeah, might pull a muscle.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.143
We have a case?

05:52.269 --> 05:54.061
Seizure that can't be explained
by epilepsy

05:54.187 --> 05:56.022
and accompanied by
elevated calcium levels.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.941
Still bored. Tell her why.

05:59.067 --> 06:03.612
Because seizure with mildly elevated
calcium is diagnostically simple.

06:03.739 --> 06:08.492
It's either hyperparathyroid, cancer,
or calcium-mediated neurotoxicity.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.744
Well done.

06:10.829 --> 06:14.582
But until you can remember how
to make coffee, hands off the patients.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.417
House.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.504
All those reasons this case bores you,
the ER has already ruled them out.

06:30.140 --> 06:34.018
Lungs are clear. Get an EEG.
Confirm the brain function is OK.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.270
Can we focus on the task at hand?

06:37.022 --> 06:40.608
Why did Mommy twitch so hard that
she tossed the baby in the bath water?

06:40.734 --> 06:43.861
- You don't need me for this.
- Of course I need you. We're a team.

06:43.987 --> 06:47.531
Polyarteritis nodosa. Inflamed arteries
in the brain cause seizures.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.284
Inflamed arteries in the kidneys
cause calcium build-up.

06:50.410 --> 06:54.246
You're a moron. Did you even look at
the file? Kidney function is fine.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.874
- Whipple's?
- What?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.919
- Whipple's.
- Test her.

07:00.045 --> 07:03.881
Cameron thinks it starts with a "W".
I'm thinking "V".

07:04.007 --> 07:06.926
The dad vomited this morning.
Maybe they've both got strep.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.719
You think you can do
a strep-throat culture

07:08.845 --> 07:10.846
without the swab ending up in
the guy's poop chute?

07:10.972 --> 07:13.182
- "V" for "vasoconstriction".
- That'd be my guess.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.643
Excess calcium makes blood vessels
in the brain clamp down.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.562
Best case scenario, seizure.
Worst case, stroke.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.065
Do a digital subtraction angiogram.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.692
Foreman can't tell up from down,
Cameron's a girl.

07:23.819 --> 07:24.985
All that mechanical stuff.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.446
Sorry. Cuddy says I'm stuck here.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.468
You're late.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.388
And you are in my locked office.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.016
- Again.
- What you got there?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.935
Special panties for your date
with Wilson?

07:58.061 --> 08:00.312
It's not a date.
And it's none of your business.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.356
If it's not a date, it is business.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.067
And if it was business, you wouldn't say
it was none of my business.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.695
- What do you want?
- To talk about your date with Wilson.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.072
- It's not a date.
- This is fun.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.159
Spring Chase from NICU
and I'll shut up about your date.

08:13.285 --> 08:17.955
- NICU is short-staffed.
- Have you lost the ability to lie?

08:18.081 --> 08:21.000
Nobody's quit NICU in two years.

08:21.126 --> 08:26.172
And if you're making up reasons,
that means there is no reason,

08:26.298 --> 08:29.133
which means he asked for the
assignment, didn't he?

08:29.259 --> 08:32.136
If Chase needs a break from you,
he should take it.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.142
Absolutely.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.904
Both Mom and Dad are negative for
strep.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.868
You'll be back playing with
the big toys soon.

08:55.994 --> 08:59.622
- Or not. Either way, I'm fine.
- You don't have to say that.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.459
It's OK. I could always work
in a research lab or teach.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.088
- And you'd be OK with that?
- Why wouldn't I be?

09:08.215 --> 09:12.009
You were planning on pursuing grants
of your own, running a department.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.802
I'm alive.

09:13.929 --> 09:16.388
Changing jobs, not making coffee,

09:16.514 --> 09:20.226
if that stuff bothers me now,
I don't deserve this second chance.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.905
They say that physical contact
helps the healing process.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.095
What's happening?

09:56.888 --> 10:00.099
Your son's not getting enough oxygen.
Take Mr Mason outside.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.026
Lung's collapsed. He's not getting
any air. I need an IV catheter.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.073
Another seizure?

10:16.199 --> 10:18.701
Her chest muscles aren't contracting.
It's something else.

10:24.791 --> 10:28.502
Her whole back is spasming.
I need two milligrams of lorazepam.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.053
He's OK.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.849
His lung wouldn't collapse if he was OK.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.435
- What the hell's happening?
- I have no idea.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.916
So what causes seizures,

11:08.043 --> 11:11.879
hypercalcemia, and the thing
where Mommy bends like Gumby?

11:12.005 --> 11:14.715
- Little busy here.
- Uh-oh.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.092
Baby's lungs are gonna conk out
any minute.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.510
Probably want to deal with that.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.846
I'll get right on it as soon as
I finish indulging my boss.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.349
- Multi-task.
- Chemical pneumonitis.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.060
Bubble bath got into the baby's lungs
when he was underwater.

11:26.186 --> 11:30.022
Start him on prednisone.
Keep him on high FI02.

11:30.148 --> 11:32.232
Let the indulging commence.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.568
Lithium could cause all three of
the mother's symptoms.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.071
- No record she's on lithium.
- And the tox screen was negative.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.948
Lithium doesn't show on
a basic tox screen, Scarecrow.

11:40.075 --> 11:43.118
Myelomatous meningitis could also
cover everything.

11:43.244 --> 11:47.206
Rare complications of a rare blood
cancer. You're not totally hopeless.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.292
Get an S-PEP and an MRI for
myelomatous meningitis.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.044
Search the patient's place for lithium.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.339
The baby's lung problem is bacterial
and not chemical. Start ECMO.

11:55.465 --> 11:59.426
While you're searching for the lithium,
take a water sample and check the pipes.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.096
You want me to write this down for you?

12:03.681 --> 12:07.559
I ask you, is almost dying
any excuse for not being fun?

12:11.981 --> 12:13.941
I'm not putting that baby on ECMO.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.193
The chance of there being bacteria
in bathwater...

12:16.319 --> 12:18.737
Why don't you want to work for me?

12:18.863 --> 12:21.031
I'm nice, I'm fun at parties.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.410
I'm not working NICU because of you.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.831
The baby's x-ray suggested
chemical pneumonitis.

12:28.957 --> 12:32.709
Not to me.
The x-ray was too consolidated.

12:32.836 --> 12:36.004
So, why are you down here?
Hoping to expand your make-out pool

12:36.131 --> 12:39.007
to include the preemie
to nine-year-old demographic?

12:43.221 --> 12:44.680
I needed a break.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.016
From the patients.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.270
They lie to us all the time.

12:51.396 --> 12:54.440
Foreman almost died trying to save
a drug-dealing cop.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.527
I just wanted to get away from that
for a while.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.449
What a complete load of crap.

13:03.575 --> 13:08.287
What am I? A nurse you're trying to prep
with this vulnerability thing?

13:08.413 --> 13:09.913
ECMO could kill him.

13:10.039 --> 13:13.292
You don't start him on ECMO and that
infection could rampage through his body

13:13.418 --> 13:15.878
like Pistons fans after a championship.

13:16.671 --> 13:20.382
But you do it your way.
Nothing more honest than a dead baby.

13:24.095 --> 13:27.639
ECMO stands for
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

13:27.765 --> 13:31.268
- We remove your son's blood...
- OK, all of his blood?

13:31.394 --> 13:35.772
We run it through a machine which takes
out carbon dioxide and adds oxygen.

13:35.899 --> 13:39.359
Then we re-warm the blood
and run it back into his body.

13:39.486 --> 13:44.198
There is a significant risk of internal
hemorrhaging, and he may also suffer...

13:44.324 --> 13:47.034
You put him on antibiotics.
Won't that take care of the infection?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.619
Not fast enough.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.040
Are you sure this is Mikey's best shot?

13:54.959 --> 13:56.210
Absolutely.

14:22.654 --> 14:24.530
- Cuddy's trash?
- Not any more.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.740
I paid good money for it.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.492
Look at what she bought.

14:29.869 --> 14:33.664
- Red clover.
- What is red clover used for?

14:33.790 --> 14:39.002
Also used to treat asthma,
psoriasis, joint pain...

14:39.128 --> 14:42.047
She doesn't wheeze, flake, or ache.

14:42.173 --> 14:46.009
And she didn't ask a pulmonologist
or a dermatologist for dinner.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.886
She invited an oncologist.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.057
It's not a date. It's a consult.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.853
Mom's MRI was negative for
masses, abscesses.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.147
- There's no sign she has myelomatous...
- Fascinating.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.984
- Call me when we have...
- She has a subarachnoid bleed.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.737
So, why is our patient
bleeding into her brain?

15:05.863 --> 15:08.115
Her blood work-up shows
her pro-time's elevated.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.952
She's bleeding because she's not
clotting. So, why is she not clotting?

15:12.078 --> 15:13.328
What did you bring us, Daddy?

15:13.454 --> 15:17.374
The only mood-altering drug was vodka
at the back of a drawer.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.668
Hiding booze is
a classic alcoholic behavior.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.795
- That'd explain the bleeding.
- What bleeding?

15:21.921 --> 15:25.591
You don't remember? She bled
all over you this morning. Kidding.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.927
Idiots are fun.
No wonder every village wants one.

15:29.053 --> 15:32.472
If she's an alcoholic, she would
also be more prone to hypercalcemia.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.683
But the tox screen was
negative for alcohol.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.226
Hey, it was your idea.

15:36.352 --> 15:39.438
Now, it's even better.
Mommy quits. She gets the DTs.

15:39.564 --> 15:42.566
- Even explains the seizure.
- It also fits conversion disorder.

15:42.692 --> 15:45.986
They're deep in debt, he's working
around the clock, they got a new baby.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.822
I think the seizure was a physical
response to psychological stress.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.866
Boozy Mommy covers more symptoms.

15:50.992 --> 15:54.494
Put her in a nice phenobarbital coma
before the DTs kill her.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.750
- Where are you going?
- To put her in a pheno coma.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.793
What if I'm wrong?
What if Daddy's the drunk?

16:01.919 --> 16:03.587
Do you want us to give her
the pheno or not?

16:03.713 --> 16:05.088
I want him to argue his point.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.341
I assume you considered the father
and ruled him out.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.135
What's that saying? When you assume,
you become a pain in the ass to me.

16:10.261 --> 16:12.304
Why should I argue?
You'd just overrule me.

16:12.430 --> 16:16.058
Enough! Get a pony or a watermelon
farm.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.934
- House?
- I need him to react.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.811
I need him to act like a human being.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.981
I need him to get over
this boring near-death rebirth.

16:23.107 --> 16:26.652
I have changed.
That's not something you get over.

16:26.778 --> 16:30.572
Nearly dying changes everything forever.
For about two months.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.825
Two months is too long.
I need the guy I hired back. Now.

16:33.951 --> 16:37.454
No matter how much your misery
loves company, it's not getting mine.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.414
I'll talk to the dad.
Cameron can take the mom.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.958
- We'll figure out if Mom is a drinker.
- Waste of time.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.711
Put her in a coma
before the DTs kill her.

17:02.647 --> 17:03.772
So...

17:05.566 --> 17:07.317
...is this a separation, or...

17:08.945 --> 17:12.072
Well, lawyers have been hired,
friends divvied up.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.741
Oddly, she didn't fight me for House.

17:16.077 --> 17:20.122
At least there aren't kids involved.
You just have each other to deal with.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.127
If there had been kids,
maybe we would have done more of that.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.383
Do you want kids?

17:34.721 --> 17:38.849
Listen, is there anything in particular
you wanted to...

17:38.975 --> 17:41.852
- Hospital business or...
- Catching up.

17:43.271 --> 17:48.024
I mean, you know, it's not like either
one of us has anybody to run home to.

17:50.153 --> 17:50.986
No.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.124
How are you feeling?

18:05.710 --> 18:08.920
OK. A little groggy.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.922
There's somebody here to see you.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.970
Hey, Mikey. Mommy's awake.

18:20.933 --> 18:25.729
Oh, Mikey. Gosh, I was so scared.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.649
Oh, I love you.

18:31.319 --> 18:34.237
I love you so much. Oh.

18:37.408 --> 18:38.617
I'm sorry.

18:39.869 --> 18:43.663
You don't have anything to be
sorry about. You were sick.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.344
Turns out she and her husband met
in AA.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.930
Obviously, she slipped. Good call.

19:00.056 --> 19:04.309
It wasn't hard, considering my other
choice was your stupid psych theory.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.646
Which was not stupid.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.317
I'm telling you, I'm gonna drop
the N-bomb if I have to.

19:12.443 --> 19:15.821
- You're addicted to conflict.
- Did they change the name?

19:15.947 --> 19:18.782
You could have handled this patient
without dragging Chase in.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.909
But the fact that he didn't want in
killed you.

19:21.035 --> 19:23.829
Just like the fact you can't get
a rise out of me.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.043
Where's the baby?

19:38.636 --> 19:42.430
Get off me! No! I have to do this!

19:42.557 --> 19:44.933
No breath sounds.
Crash cart and epi! Stat!

19:47.603 --> 19:50.021
I told you your psych theory
wasn't stupid.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.860
Your son is stable.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.070
But the lack of oxygen
damaged his kidneys.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.990
She must have rolled over on him
by mistake.

20:00.116 --> 20:04.035
Mr Mason, I was there.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.413
Your wife tried to smother your son.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.544
That's impossible.
Kara would never hurt Mikey.

20:16.966 --> 20:20.468
He knows. They said Mikey knows.

20:21.846 --> 20:22.846
You hear voices?

20:22.972 --> 20:26.474
They wouldn't quit saying that
Mikey would be better off if...

20:29.812 --> 20:31.021
They were right.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.527
We've been trying to diagnose
a seizure that didn't exist.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.530
She faked it when her husband caught
her. I don't think she faked it.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.742
She just happened to seize right in
the middle of drowning her child?

20:43.868 --> 20:46.578
- Lucky break for the kid.
- Hey, take it easy on Foreman.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.622
He's playing with one lobe
tied behind his back.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.916
Postpartum psychosis
makes her want to drown her kid.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.876
The internal conflict
triggers a seizure.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.879
You know what else might be a trigger?
A physical illness.

20:56.005 --> 20:56.963
It's a wild idea, I know.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.799
Especially since she doesn't have
any obviously physical symptoms,

20:59.926 --> 21:02.344
like internal bleeding
or excess calcium.

21:02.470 --> 21:06.598
- I'll draw some blood.
- Oh! Jeez! You've done it again!

21:06.724 --> 21:09.267
- Will you argue with me?
- Drinkers don't eat right.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.269
That explains the bleeding
and the calcium.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.812
This might just be some crazy drunk,

21:12.939 --> 21:15.815
and I'm telling you she's about
to die of myelomatous meningitis.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.401
- We already tested for...
- Exactly. It's an insane idea.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.988
- What do you want me to do?
- Have an original thought.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.366
In the meantime, stress her into
having another seizure.

21:24.492 --> 21:25.992
We can't. She's on haloperidol.

21:26.118 --> 21:29.329
You also can't because it's dangerous
and highly unethical.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.873
Therefore, if you get caught,
pretend you can't make coffee.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.125
Mental defectives get tons of slack.

21:36.671 --> 21:39.005
Take her off the haloperidol,
hook her up to an EEG,

21:39.131 --> 21:41.591
flash some lights, make her pant,
shoot her up with a placebo.

21:41.717 --> 21:44.469
When she starts twitching, if
the machine twitches along, it's real.

21:44.595 --> 21:47.764
If not, well, call the cops,
cos she's a psycho killer.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.897
- Stop pushing him.
- Stop protecting him.

21:56.023 --> 21:58.483
- He needs it.
- Not if he wants to get better.

21:58.609 --> 22:01.903
- He might not be able to get better.
- Well, I need a new neurologist.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.154
He got sick doing his job.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.449
If he got killed doing his job,
I wouldn't keep him on the payroll.

22:06.575 --> 22:10.370
I don't care how guilty you feel or how
touched you are by his reborn spirit.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.414
- I am not touched.
- Then you're guilt-ridden.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.499
- I'm not guilt-ridden.
- Then you're pathetic.

22:14.625 --> 22:15.667
Right now, I'm annoyed.

22:15.793 --> 22:18.503
Keeping him up in the seizure lab
is not the way to advance his recovery.

22:18.629 --> 22:20.088
- It's too much.
- You're right.

22:20.214 --> 22:23.258
You should stick around.
Make sure he doesn't screw up.

22:32.143 --> 22:34.352
Kara, look directly into the light.

22:36.147 --> 22:37.439
Keep looking.

22:39.567 --> 22:40.942
Thought you'd be gone for the day.

22:41.068 --> 22:44.320
Thought I'd wait for
the bone marrow biopsy results.

22:44.447 --> 22:46.489
House sent you to baby-sit me,
didn't he?

22:46.615 --> 22:48.158
He asked me to wait for the results.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.535
- Cameron, it's fine.
- Of course it is.

22:52.705 --> 22:56.458
Look, a few weeks ago, you were upset
that I didn't consider you a friend.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.793
Now you're upset that I'm happy?

22:58.919 --> 23:01.838
What can I say? Apparently, I'm a bitch.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.214
I didn't say that.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.382
It's annoying.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.384
Insisting every day of your life
is a blessing

23:06.510 --> 23:08.386
is basically calling
everyone else shallow.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.930
- It gets old.
- Sorry.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.390
Oh, give it a rest.

23:17.772 --> 23:18.897
How was dinner?

23:20.107 --> 23:21.983
Cuddy did not mention cancer.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.904
- She lost her nerve.
- It was a date.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.492
- What are you doing?
- PCR test.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.038
You're doing it yourself in
the middle of the night.

23:36.832 --> 23:37.999
On a spoon.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.044
Cuddy's spoon.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.296
I'm checking her saliva
for cancer markers.

23:45.382 --> 23:49.010
Yeah. I do that after all my dates, too.

23:51.013 --> 23:53.056
People think you're the nice one.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.391
Why are you so worried about Cuddy?

23:55.518 --> 23:59.562
You go first.
You desperately want this to be a date.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.273
Because the alternative is cancer.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.025
Just admit that you like her.

24:04.151 --> 24:07.821
She's smart, funny, got a zesty bod.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.824
I think it's great you can look
beyond the fact she's the devil.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.159
I stole a spoon. You stole her garbage.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.994
She's my boss.

24:15.121 --> 24:19.624
If she gets sick, the hospital might
replace her, especially if she dies.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.418
I'd have to learn how to
manipulate someone new.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.921
Whoa.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.881
I think I'm gonna cry.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.883
Find me when the results come in.

24:37.393 --> 24:41.271
Mr Mason, because of the damage
done to your son's kidneys,

24:41.397 --> 24:43.940
his potassium is climbing.

24:44.066 --> 24:46.192
That's causing irregular heartbeats.

24:46.318 --> 24:49.737
I'm doubling the meds
and starting him on dialysis.

24:49.864 --> 24:56.161
But unless we get his potassium down,
he's gonna have a heart attack.

25:00.374 --> 25:01.791
Kara, just another few minutes.

25:01.917 --> 25:05.879
Biopsy's back. She's negative for
myelomatous meningitis.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.755
And she's not seizing.

25:08.716 --> 25:12.135
- So, we're wrong and House is wrong.
- And you're OK with that?

25:13.804 --> 25:14.888
She's seizing.

25:19.101 --> 25:20.977
She's not doing anything.

25:21.103 --> 25:24.063
Her brain activity isn't accelerating,
it's slowing down.

25:28.694 --> 25:31.779
Muscle rigidity, involuntary grasping
and sucking motions.

25:31.906 --> 25:34.073
She's in an encephalopathic delirium.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.950
Hmm.

25:36.076 --> 25:39.746
A genuine physiological illness.
That rules out a few things.

25:39.872 --> 25:40.914
Like what, I wonder?

25:41.040 --> 25:43.833
Postpartum psychosis
and conversion disorder.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.878
The thing about being a good loser,
you're still a loser.

25:47.004 --> 25:48.129
Ouch.

25:48.923 --> 25:50.798
The delirium means her brain is
shutting down,

25:50.925 --> 25:52.926
reverting to
its most instinctual functions.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.762
And since it's progressing,
I think we can assume it's progressive,

25:55.888 --> 25:59.599
which means it won't be long before
the brain closes shop altogether.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.392
Ideas?

26:04.396 --> 26:07.815
- He's in V-fib.
- His potassium's still too high.

26:09.985 --> 26:11.903
No pulse. Get him off the machine.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.910
Charge to 10. Clear.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.038
Still in V-fib.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.083
Another amp of epi.

26:29.004 --> 26:32.257
Chase shouldn't be
wasting his time in NICU.

26:32.383 --> 26:33.758
Could be Wernicke's.

26:33.884 --> 26:36.010
No. Treatment for
Wernicke's is thiamine.

26:36.136 --> 26:38.554
We gave her that
together with the pheno.

26:38.681 --> 26:41.057
Delirium points to lithium.
I know we didn't' find any, but...

26:41.183 --> 26:43.476
She'd have to be smuggling it in
to be getting sicker.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.104
Whipple's causes
encephalopathic delirium.

26:46.230 --> 26:47.522
The test was negative.

26:47.648 --> 26:50.775
- The test could have been wrong.
- Ideas are not soda cans.

26:50.901 --> 26:54.904
Recycling sucks.
Give me something new and shiny.

26:55.030 --> 26:59.867
Or go retro. Take an old idea,
shine it up, and add a new symptom.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.954
Encephalopathic delirium.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.832
Pellagra.

27:05.958 --> 27:09.043
She drinks. Alcoholics get pellagra.

27:09.169 --> 27:11.629
They eat lousy diets, so no niacin.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.882
- He agrees with me. What a shock.
- Well, you're right.

27:15.009 --> 27:17.719
Lack of niacin starves the brain.
Neurons shut down.

27:17.845 --> 27:20.722
Causes seizures, encephalopathic
delirium and psychosis.

27:20.848 --> 27:22.849
We give Kara niacin,
she'll come out of her delirium

27:22.975 --> 27:24.517
and she'll be totally sane.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.061
Don't think she's ever
gonna be sane again.

27:29.398 --> 27:30.898
Her son just died.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.513
How do you feel?

28:03.057 --> 28:04.891
Er...

28:06.769 --> 28:10.063
My stomach kinda hurts.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.316
I need to ask you some questions,
see how you're doing.

28:13.442 --> 28:16.110
Mmm-hmm.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.820
Tell me your name.

28:17.946 --> 28:22.283
Kara Mason. Is my son here?

28:22.409 --> 28:24.369
When were you born?

28:24.495 --> 28:27.497
Please. Where's Michael? Is he OK?

28:27.623 --> 28:29.791
Do you hear any other voices
besides mine?

28:29.917 --> 28:32.377
No. Answer me.

28:32.503 --> 28:34.879
You've been suffering from delusions.

28:35.005 --> 28:38.007
They were caused by a vitamin
deficiency, pellagra.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.885
It made you believe things
that were not real.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.597
Like the voices.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.436
I...

28:55.651 --> 28:59.237
...remember doing things to Mikey.

28:59.363 --> 29:00.822
Were those real?

29:03.909 --> 29:05.243
I'm afraid so.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.041
So, I...

29:15.087 --> 29:17.839
- You tried to suffocate your son.
- But...

29:19.925 --> 29:24.887
You... You stopped me.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.389
And...

29:26.515 --> 29:31.102
...that other doctor,
he got Mikey breathing.

29:31.228 --> 29:33.896
Your son's organs were damaged
too severely.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.235
He passed away this morning.

29:41.989 --> 29:46.659
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

29:46.785 --> 29:48.119
No!

29:50.205 --> 29:54.876
Oh, my God! No! Oh, my God!

30:00.048 --> 30:02.425
Pellagra doesn't cause
bloody vomit.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.594
She's still sick and getting worse.

30:04.720 --> 30:09.724
So what causes pellagra
and crimson spew?

30:10.809 --> 30:13.352
Dead baby, while sad, not our problem.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.480
I should have given him
more polystyrene.

30:15.606 --> 30:18.691
You killed him. If you don't get
over it, you're gonna kill Mama, too.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.861
Her alcoholism caused the pellagra.
Maybe it also explains the vomiting.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.030
- Gastritis.
- Gastritis meds aren't helping,

30:24.156 --> 30:26.449
which may confirm her story.
She only slipped once.

30:26.575 --> 30:28.868
You remove drinking from the equation,

30:28.994 --> 30:32.038
internal bleeding, hypercalcemia,
seizure, and pellagra are all back in.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.248
Chase, will you get your head
out of the dead baby's butt

30:34.374 --> 30:36.834
and focus on the barely alive?

30:39.963 --> 30:41.631
How much polystyrene
did you give the kid?

30:41.757 --> 30:43.424
One gram.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.551
His potassium just kept rising.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.820
I need your son.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.908
Who are you?

31:09.701 --> 31:13.496
Your wife's doctor. Your son may
have had the same condition she does.

31:13.622 --> 31:17.833
My son didn't have a condition.
She killed him.

31:17.960 --> 31:21.879
If I biopsy her intestine,
she'll bleed out.

31:22.005 --> 31:24.257
He obviously won't.

31:24.383 --> 31:27.927
You're not using my son's body
to help her.

31:29.263 --> 31:33.057
OK. How about trading him for a beer?

31:33.183 --> 31:35.560
Or maybe you're more of a whiskey guy.

31:37.437 --> 31:40.106
You didn't have strep or a stomach bug
the morning you came in.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.192
You puked because you were hung over.

31:43.318 --> 31:46.946
Accuse a recovered drunk of slipping
and most of the time, you'll be right.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.239
So I drink.

31:49.283 --> 31:51.742
You're acting like this is my fault.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.452
People are gonna feel sorry for you

31:53.579 --> 31:56.122
and they'll tell you that
you can't anticipate the unthinkable.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.873
The fact is, you can.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.667
It's just not all that pleasant.

31:59.793 --> 32:01.294
Look, you don't know anything about...

32:01.420 --> 32:03.546
I know that people don't get crazy
enough to kill someone

32:03.672 --> 32:06.507
without first being crazy enough
for someone to notice.

32:06.633 --> 32:10.595
How many times did you go out
for a drink because she was crying?

32:10.721 --> 32:12.138
How many times did you stay at work

32:12.264 --> 32:15.600
because you couldn't listen to her
telling you what a bad mother she is?

32:15.726 --> 32:18.894
You were relieved when she shut down

32:19.021 --> 32:21.731
and just sat staring
for hours at a time.

32:22.816 --> 32:27.069
She held the pillow over his head.
You slept while she went nuts.

32:27.195 --> 32:30.364
- Not exactly a draw, but...
- What is wrong with you?

32:30.490 --> 32:32.908
What kind of a person
says those things now?

32:34.703 --> 32:36.037
Let me do the test.

32:36.830 --> 32:39.790
It'll be one less thing
for you to feel crappy about.

32:49.885 --> 32:52.470
I got a dead baby for you to biopsy.

32:52.596 --> 32:56.307
- Let Cameron do it.
- Love working NICU?

32:56.433 --> 32:58.184
- I could get you transferred.
- I told you.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.144
I just wanted to trust patients.

33:00.270 --> 33:02.688
You don't give a crap about patients.

33:06.652 --> 33:07.735
Your paycheck.

33:10.197 --> 33:12.365
You've been double-dipping.

33:12.491 --> 33:16.285
Taking your vacation time here,
while drawing a salary in NICU.

33:16.411 --> 33:19.955
Strange. Rich boy doing all that
for some extra cash.

33:22.584 --> 33:27.171
- I'm not rich.
- But your dad was. Now he's dead.

33:27.297 --> 33:30.174
If you're not rich,
that means that Daddy cut you out.

33:31.593 --> 33:32.885
I'm not rich.

33:34.471 --> 33:36.097
Don't let it change you.

33:38.934 --> 33:40.142
And do the test.

33:58.620 --> 34:02.581
God of compassion,
take Michael into your arms

34:02.708 --> 34:04.792
and welcome him into paradise.

34:05.961 --> 34:09.880
Let there be no sorrow, no weeping,
and no pain.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.342
Peace and joy forevermore.

34:18.724 --> 34:19.849
I'm sorry.

34:43.790 --> 34:46.876
It was a date. Cuddy's negative
for all cancer markers.

34:47.794 --> 34:49.128
It was a date.

34:54.009 --> 34:56.802
The baby's intestine shows
slight villous atrophy.

35:01.892 --> 35:04.810
Why would a baby have flattened villi?

35:04.936 --> 35:07.521
He was being treated with polystyrene.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.899
- Polystyrene shouldn't...
- It didn't.

35:10.025 --> 35:12.651
The question is, what do they use
in the NICU to bind it together?

35:12.778 --> 35:15.029
- Wheat gluten.
- It's great stuff.

35:15.155 --> 35:17.823
Unless your body can't tolerate it.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.618
The baby didn't have colic?
He had celiac disease?

35:20.744 --> 35:22.703
Just like Mom.

35:22.829 --> 35:25.915
Celiac can be triggered by
all kinds of stress.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.751
Bills, childbirth, drunk husband...

35:28.877 --> 35:31.504
Every time she had a bowl of pasta or
a slice of bread

35:31.630 --> 35:36.217
or a slosh of soy sauce,
her small intestine became more damaged,

35:36.343 --> 35:39.553
less able to absorb the vitamins
and minerals into her bloodstream.

35:39.679 --> 35:42.640
Her body couldn't absorb enough niacin,
caused the pellagra.

35:42.766 --> 35:44.850
Couldn't absorb vitamin K,
caused the bleeding.

35:44.976 --> 35:48.020
And celiac is why the baby's meds
didn't work.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.316
His body just couldn't absorb them.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.570
Switch Mom to IV nutrition.
It's gluten-free.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.405
That'll spruce her villi right up.

35:58.532 --> 36:00.741
No. Celiac causes
nutritional deprivation.

36:00.867 --> 36:02.952
Our patient has excess calcium.

36:03.078 --> 36:06.789
Tell them what causes excess calcium
with a chaser of bloody vomit.

36:09.125 --> 36:12.795
Celiac patients are susceptible
to cancer of the stomach lining.

36:13.922 --> 36:16.966
- She has MALT lymphoma.
- Well, she's your patient, now.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.678
And it wasn't a date.

36:30.397 --> 36:33.691
- You don't have cancer.
- You don't have dwarfism.

36:33.817 --> 36:37.361
You have no proof of that.
I, on the other hand, have this.

36:40.282 --> 36:42.199
You ran a PCR on me without my
consent?

36:42.325 --> 36:44.410
- Hey, it's good news.
- Really?

36:44.536 --> 36:45.661
It's just hard to access

36:45.787 --> 36:48.789
because of this overwhelming sense
of personal violation.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.543
Deal with it on your own time.

36:52.669 --> 36:55.337
Bad news.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.047
Estrogen is too high.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.008
No matter how many people
you tell otherwise,

36:59.134 --> 37:02.761
I am and always have been a woman.
Estrogen is normal.

37:02.888 --> 37:06.557
Not this much. Not for, at least,
another week.

37:06.683 --> 37:08.559
That's when you ovulate.

37:11.062 --> 37:16.942
You monitor my periods
based on when I get bitchy or...

37:17.777 --> 37:20.529
Once a month, when you leave
the kids' cancer ward,

37:20.655 --> 37:22.698
your eyes glisten.

37:22.824 --> 37:24.992
And about three days later,
you break your ban on sugar

37:25.118 --> 37:30.247
and chow down a bucket of frozen yogurt
in the cafeteria. Sprinkles included.

37:30.373 --> 37:32.374
Based on the last yogurt sighting,

37:32.500 --> 37:34.668
you've got another week
before you ovulate.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.464
You're on fertility meds.

37:41.051 --> 37:43.719
With red clover as an herbal booster.

37:45.597 --> 37:48.432
And the dinner with Wilson
was an audition.

37:49.684 --> 37:53.562
It's too bad he didn't land the gig.
He would have had fun.

37:53.688 --> 37:56.815
I was considering a donation.
Not a party.

37:58.652 --> 38:01.904
So, when's our dinner?

38:07.243 --> 38:10.621
- Oh, he's gonna be so disappointed.
- Right.

38:10.747 --> 38:13.832
You two are gonna have
a lot of fun with this.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.210
Your patient won't let me touch her.

38:23.551 --> 38:24.760
I killed my son.

38:29.808 --> 38:33.102
Is it my turn
to say something obvious now?

38:33.228 --> 38:35.521
Oh, I know. You were insane.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.856
I did it. I chose to do it.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.985
Yeah. Like diabetics choose
to not produce insulin.

38:43.363 --> 38:47.366
Listen. Someone got sick.
Someone died.

38:47.492 --> 38:48.909
It happens every day.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.247
The only difference in this case is,
it wasn't the same someone.

38:53.373 --> 38:54.790
I could have stopped.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.877
I didn't have to listen to those voices.

38:59.629 --> 39:01.672
Spoken like a true sane person.

39:03.717 --> 39:05.509
This is not your fault.

39:06.636 --> 39:07.970
You're healthy now.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.806
Except for the cancer.

39:12.684 --> 39:16.395
Those voices felt as real to me

39:16.521 --> 39:19.565
as Michael's hand

39:19.691 --> 39:22.526
right here, when he nursed,

39:22.652 --> 39:25.070
and the smell of his hair.

39:31.036 --> 39:34.246
You do not deserve to die.

39:36.708 --> 39:37.833
Maybe.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.216
I don't want to live.

39:57.771 --> 39:58.812
She said no.

39:58.938 --> 40:01.273
So we get her declared unstable,
appoint a medical proxy...

40:01.399 --> 40:05.277
She was unstable. Now, she's sane.
She's entitled to refuse the treatment.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.529
You have to change her mind.
You can't just walk away.

40:07.655 --> 40:10.532
Fine! Go on in there and tell her
that every day is a blessing.

40:10.658 --> 40:14.870
"So you killed your baby? Shake it off.
Think positive. At least you're alive."

40:16.915 --> 40:18.332
Hmm.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.667
Kinda hard to sell when
you don't believe it, huh?

40:20.794 --> 40:21.835
And you never believed it.

40:21.961 --> 40:24.588
You just wanted all that crap
you went through to mean something.

40:24.714 --> 40:27.800
Well, it didn't mean anything.
It never does. Welcome back.

40:30.512 --> 40:33.472
Why are you doing this to me?
I was happy.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.224
You were aspiring to be content.

40:35.350 --> 40:39.269
Don't give me a semantic argument.
I was content with the way things were.

40:39.395 --> 40:40.771
- That's what happiness is.
- Yeah.

40:40.897 --> 40:42.773
If we were all just satisfied
with what we had,

40:42.899 --> 40:44.525
what a beautiful world it would be.

40:44.651 --> 40:46.610
We'd all slowly starve to death
in our own filth,

40:46.736 --> 40:48.737
but at least we'd be happy.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.949
Listen, I need your self-worth
to hang on this job.

40:52.075 --> 40:54.618
Kicking ass here to be all that
lets you rise above miserable.

40:54.744 --> 40:57.746
If waking up in the morning is enough,
I don't need you.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.540
I can live with that.

41:01.626 --> 41:04.002
No, you can't. Not any more.

41:32.782 --> 41:35.117
If you got treatment,
then maybe we could...

41:48.715 --> 41:49.965
When you see Mikey...

41:53.720 --> 41:55.804
...tell him his dad says he's sorry.

42:08.401 --> 42:09.526
Hi.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.780
- Night.
- Night.

42:16.910 --> 42:19.369
Did you tell Cuddy
we tested her for cancer?

42:19.495 --> 42:21.079
- Yeah.
- And?

42:21.998 --> 42:23.457
It wasn't a date.

42:25.668 --> 42:27.502
Turned out she had some skin lesions.

42:27.629 --> 42:29.880
Guess there was
no genetic predisposition.

42:33.343 --> 42:34.968
You TiVo The L Word?
