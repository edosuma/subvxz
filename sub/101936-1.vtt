00:08.691 --> 00:11.093
<i>But this city of Houston...</i>

00:11.159 --> 00:12.861
<i>This state of Texas...</i>

00:12.928 --> 00:15.531
<i>This country of the United
States was not...</i>

00:15.596 --> 00:18.467
<i>built by those who
waited, and rested.</i>

00:18.534 --> 00:22.704
<i>Is it that man in his quest for
knowledge and progress</i>

00:22.771 --> 00:25.374
<i>is determined
and cannot be deterred.</i>

00:25.441 --> 00:29.143
<i>The exploration of space
will go ahead whether</i>

00:29.210 --> 00:32.348
<i>we join in it or not.</i>

00:32.414 --> 00:34.483
<i>And it is one of
the great adventures..."</i>

00:34.549 --> 00:36.017
<i>"It's one small step for
man..."</i>

00:36.085 --> 00:39.322
<i>"No national conflict
in outer space..."</i>

00:39.388 --> 00:40.790
<i>"One giant leap for mankind."</i>

00:40.856 --> 00:43.659
<i>"It's hazards are
hostile to us all.</i>

00:43.726 --> 00:48.330
<i>"Its conquest deserves
the best of all mankind..."</i>

01:16.859 --> 01:20.663
<i>Pandemonium has swept across
the globe as reports come in</i>

01:20.728 --> 01:22.764
<i>that an asteroid has collided
with the moon,</i>

01:22.830 --> 01:25.634
<i>knocking it on a
trajectory towards earth.</i>

01:25.702 --> 01:28.837
<i>Emergency lockdowns are
being imposed in major cities</i>

01:28.904 --> 01:31.640
<i>as law enforcement struggles
to maintain control</i>

01:31.707 --> 01:35.110
<i>of the escalating chaos amongst
fear-stricken citizens.</i>

01:35.177 --> 01:37.845
<i>Many countries have reported
power grid disruptions,</i>

01:37.913 --> 01:40.015
<i>major earthquakes and
tidal flooding</i>

01:40.082 --> 01:42.752
<i>along coastal cities
with many forced</i>

01:42.818 --> 01:45.588
<i>to evacuate and
seek higher ground.</i>

01:45.654 --> 01:48.256
<i>Increased theological activity
and volcanic eruptions</i>

01:48.323 --> 01:51.293
<i>have caused extensive damage
to cities and communities</i>

01:51.359 --> 01:53.495
<i>along major fault lines.</i>

01:53.562 --> 01:55.330
<i>The moon is expected
to collide with the earth</i>

01:55.398 --> 01:57.033
<i>in less than three hours.</i>

01:57.100 --> 01:59.034
<i>And we will continue to see
the increased effects</i>

01:59.100 --> 02:02.271
<i>of its gravity as it
approaches our atmosphere.</i>

02:02.338 --> 02:05.607
<i>The outlook of survival
for our species</i>

02:05.675 --> 02:09.145
<i>and the continued existence of
planet earth looks grim, but...</i>

02:09.211 --> 02:10.645
Hey, Jim...

02:10.711 --> 02:12.181
<i>Our field reporters are
already starting to...</i>

02:12.248 --> 02:13.849
Is this thing for real?

02:13.915 --> 02:17.552
<i>NATO and cooperating
governments comparing data,</i>

02:17.618 --> 02:20.589
<i>joining forces to determine
how and if</i>

02:20.656 --> 02:22.057
<i>a disaster of
this magnitude...</i>

02:23.526 --> 02:25.226
This is Captain Lawson.

02:25.294 --> 02:28.064
<i>Paul's coming to airlift you
to the XVision Spaceport</i>

02:28.130 --> 02:29.363
<i>in Nevada to stop this thing.</i>

02:29.431 --> 02:31.500
You are recommissioned
to fly with

02:31.567 --> 02:34.871
the XVision space fleet
effective immediately.

02:34.937 --> 02:37.273
Well, tell Global Defense
we face total annihilation

02:37.339 --> 02:38.940
in less than two hours.

02:39.008 --> 02:41.944
NASA's initial projection of
the mission window is 3.5.

02:42.010 --> 02:44.947
No, Colonel, this isn't
some meteor in Tunguska.

02:45.012 --> 02:46.648
The sheer scale of
this will wreak havoc

02:46.716 --> 02:48.651
before it even strikes.

02:48.717 --> 02:51.285
Gravitational fluctuations,
earthquakes,

02:51.353 --> 02:53.488
volcanic eruptions,
E.M.P.s

02:53.555 --> 02:55.825
all around the world.

02:55.891 --> 02:57.726
And if the moon
reaches our atmosphere,

02:57.793 --> 02:59.194
friction will
super-heat the air

02:59.260 --> 03:00.996
and incinerate everything
on earth.

03:01.063 --> 03:02.532
<i>You get to XVision ASAP.</i>

03:02.598 --> 03:05.335
Paul's responsibility is
to brief you on the rest.

03:07.768 --> 03:10.473
Hey, Jumbo.
Good to see 'ya.

03:10.539 --> 03:11.974
Come on, we gotta go.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.408
Hey, who's that?

03:13.475 --> 03:14.976
My brother.

03:17.413 --> 03:19.015
Come on.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.450
Whoa, whoa!

03:21.516 --> 03:22.984
Was that because of the moon?

03:23.051 --> 03:26.621
No. Gravity disruptions are
causing the earthquakes.

03:26.688 --> 03:28.657
Come on, Bob.
We'll get you to the base.

03:28.724 --> 03:31.194
My tab for the last two weeks.

03:34.329 --> 03:36.198
Oh!

03:41.069 --> 03:42.136
We gotta help him.

03:42.204 --> 03:43.639
No!

03:43.706 --> 03:44.907
- Help me get him outa here!
- There's no time.

03:46.541 --> 03:48.142
Bobby, I'm gonna
get you outta here!

03:48.210 --> 03:49.378
All right, grab my hand.

03:49.444 --> 03:51.112
Come on?
I gotta pull you now!

03:55.183 --> 03:56.618
Come on!

04:00.222 --> 04:02.724
Come on, Bob.

04:11.232 --> 04:13.634
Soak the gauze in antiseptic.

04:13.701 --> 04:15.637
Oh, Jim, it hurts...

04:15.704 --> 04:17.640
Hang in there, Bobby.

04:17.707 --> 04:18.974
Look, Jim, I hate to say it,

04:19.041 --> 04:20.108
but you were right
about everything.

04:20.173 --> 04:21.309
I mean, everything.

04:21.375 --> 04:22.977
The size of the asteroid,

04:23.044 --> 04:24.479
when it would actually
strike the moon.

04:24.546 --> 04:25.815
You called all of it.

04:25.880 --> 04:29.085
- Keep feeding it to me.
- Okay.

04:29.152 --> 04:34.223
Look, I might not get another
chance at this to apologize.

04:34.289 --> 04:37.325
Jim, it wasn't your fault,
your co-pilot's death.

04:37.392 --> 04:39.327
Look, we don't have time
for ancient history right now.

04:39.394 --> 04:41.664
It's not ancient history, Jim.
It's only been a year.

04:41.729 --> 04:43.599
And, look, if I had a
time machine, I would go back

04:43.666 --> 04:46.267
and I would...

04:46.335 --> 04:48.871
I should have listened
to your report, okay?

04:48.938 --> 04:50.673
Jim, it wasn't you that
crashed your lander.

04:50.738 --> 04:52.608
It was gravity from
a distant asteroid.

04:52.674 --> 04:53.842
- We know...
- Just knock it off!

04:53.909 --> 04:56.678
Look, I'm trying
to apologize here!

04:56.745 --> 04:57.813
Like when you reported
that it was a year away

04:57.880 --> 05:00.649
from striking the moon,

05:00.715 --> 05:02.851
I should've never
had you discharged, okay?

05:04.118 --> 05:05.953
It's my fault.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.159
God.

05:13.695 --> 05:15.296
Hey, hey, hey, stay with me.

05:15.363 --> 05:16.464
Yeah, I don't do blood.

05:16.532 --> 05:17.700
Is Mom safe?

05:17.767 --> 05:19.201
How are your wife and kids?

05:19.267 --> 05:21.268
Yeah, Mom's safe.

05:21.335 --> 05:25.140
I had our office in D.C.
take Mom down to the Pentagon.

05:25.207 --> 05:26.609
Juni and the kids are there too.

05:26.676 --> 05:28.377
I didn't have the heart
to tell them that,

05:28.443 --> 05:31.546
if we can't stop this thing, it
doesn't matter where they are.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.750
But, uh... Stacey's safe too.

05:38.020 --> 05:41.823
Yeah, her new boyfriend took her
down to the Camp Pendleton Base.

05:41.890 --> 05:43.960
Good.
Hand me the tape.

05:47.596 --> 05:49.365
All right, we've got
about 15 minutes

05:49.431 --> 05:50.765
before we reach the base.

05:53.335 --> 05:55.104
Admiral Keller, this is Colonel
Hauser, Pentagon Command.

05:55.169 --> 05:59.207
It's my understanding that
Paul is currently en route

05:59.275 --> 06:00.909
with Jim Lawson
and you are keeping tabs

06:00.976 --> 06:03.479
on their progress, correct?

06:03.546 --> 06:05.046
That is correct.

06:05.113 --> 06:07.015
We are currently tracking
them via satellite and have

06:07.082 --> 06:09.116
an ETA of approximately
15 minutes.

06:09.183 --> 06:10.986
Good. As you liaison
to the D.O.D.,

06:11.053 --> 06:12.854
I've given you a lot of latitude
in developing your program,

06:12.921 --> 06:17.192
but today I am assuming full
command of your department,

06:17.258 --> 06:18.660
do you understand?

06:18.727 --> 06:20.327
Yes, ma'am.

06:20.395 --> 06:22.296
<i>As of now, our databases
are synced so that we</i>

06:22.363 --> 06:24.198
<i>are both tracking
Lawson's progress</i>

06:24.265 --> 06:26.434
<i>and the path of the Moon
in real time.</i>

06:26.501 --> 06:29.804
<i>Communication interruptions
are inevitable.</i>

06:29.871 --> 06:31.206
<i>We will
attempt to cover setbacks</i>

06:31.272 --> 06:33.073
<i>relative to Operation
Godfather.</i>

06:33.140 --> 06:35.311
<i>All pilots are standing by
on threat level Delta.</i>

06:38.347 --> 06:40.082
Am I gonna be okay, Jim?

06:40.149 --> 06:42.218
Well, I stopped
most of the bleeding.

06:42.284 --> 06:44.152
Look, we have one hour
and 42 minutes

06:44.219 --> 06:46.689
'til the moon reaches
the atmosphere.

06:48.657 --> 06:50.958
Well, Hauser recommissioned me.

06:51.025 --> 06:53.695
So you obviously need me to do
something your team can't do.

06:53.762 --> 06:56.198
As hard as it is for me
to admit, yeah, we do.

06:56.265 --> 06:59.267
As soon as you were discharged,
NASA and JPL still insisted

06:59.335 --> 07:02.436
on using your antimatter engine
design for our drone fleet.

07:02.503 --> 07:04.005
Now, given your reputation

07:04.073 --> 07:07.508
Hauser was reluctant,
but NASA pushed her.

07:07.575 --> 07:10.078
30 minutes before I saw you,
Hauser ordered us to launch

07:10.145 --> 07:12.647
a drone fleet into orbit
to try and stop the moon.

07:12.714 --> 07:14.715
So you're using
antimatter engines as bombs?

07:14.782 --> 07:15.717
It's not gonna work.

07:15.784 --> 07:17.152
No, not bombs, Jim.

07:17.219 --> 07:19.755
NASA, the DOD, the entire
world is scraping

07:19.820 --> 07:22.323
the bottom of the barrel
to try and stop the moon.

07:22.390 --> 07:23.859
I mean, nukes won't stop it,

07:23.924 --> 07:25.893
an exploding antimatter
engine won't stop it.

07:25.960 --> 07:28.629
Where are we going, Jim?

07:28.697 --> 07:30.799
I just need to know
so I can tell

07:30.866 --> 07:32.433
some friends and some family.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.537
Look, you're going to a
base called XVision.

07:34.602 --> 07:35.636
You'll be safe there.

07:35.703 --> 07:38.472
Yeah, I know what XVision is.

07:38.539 --> 07:41.242
What I don't know is how are
you planning to stop this thing?

07:41.308 --> 07:42.410
Look, I saw the news.

07:42.477 --> 07:43.410
We're all gonna die, aren't we?

07:43.477 --> 07:44.779
No.

07:44.847 --> 07:46.080
Look, you'll be safe
at the base, okay?

07:46.147 --> 07:47.515
And we do have a way
to stop the moon.

07:47.582 --> 07:48.683
How are you gonna
stop the moon?

07:48.750 --> 07:50.285
That's not even possible.

07:51.419 --> 07:52.755
It is possible.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.088
We have a spacecraft
with an engine on it

07:54.155 --> 07:55.823
with special fuel
called "antimatter".

07:55.890 --> 07:57.625
We're talking to
the military right now

07:57.693 --> 08:00.096
on how to turn it on and start
a reaction to stop the moon.

08:01.830 --> 08:04.332
He's talking about
a huge nuclear bomb!

08:04.400 --> 08:06.734
No. I'm not talking about
a huge nuclear bomb.

08:06.801 --> 08:08.602
All right, let me dumb
this down to you, Bob.

08:08.669 --> 08:09.904
Imagine a racetrack, okay?

08:09.972 --> 08:11.606
But, instead,
it's a closed tube.

08:11.674 --> 08:13.842
And the atoms are cars running
in the opposite directions.

08:13.909 --> 08:15.411
Now when they crash
into each other,

08:15.477 --> 08:16.944
they explode and release energy.

08:17.012 --> 08:19.948
Now that energy...
Bob, pay attention, please...

08:20.015 --> 08:23.017
now that energy creates a thrust
kind of like a jet engine.

08:23.085 --> 08:25.520
Now there's these little things
in the space called "neutrinos"

08:25.587 --> 08:27.723
that are floating around
that will trigger the reaction.

08:27.789 --> 08:29.023
They're gonna be acting
like the springs

08:29.090 --> 08:30.825
that launch the cars
around the track.

08:30.892 --> 08:32.894
And Hauser remembered what
you said a year ago,

08:32.961 --> 08:34.730
that if somebody
deliberately destroys

08:34.797 --> 08:36.398
the engine's cadmium
regulator...

08:36.465 --> 08:39.769
A bombardment of neutrinos will
run the reaction out of control.

08:39.833 --> 08:41.970
That's it.

08:42.038 --> 08:43.938
So you're gonna
overload an engine,

08:44.005 --> 08:46.408
create a black hole and
pull the moon back into orbit.

08:46.475 --> 08:47.409
That's the plan.

08:47.476 --> 08:49.177
Hold on.

08:49.244 --> 08:52.080
A black hole, that's gonna
destroy everything, won't it?

08:52.146 --> 08:54.082
No, Bob, it's not gonna
destroy everything.

08:54.149 --> 08:56.318
There's places on earth
like the one in Switzerland

08:56.385 --> 08:58.287
where they have the large Hadron
Collider.

08:58.352 --> 09:01.690
They split atoms every single
day to create many black holes.

09:02.491 --> 09:05.394
This is not good.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.796
Look, just calm down.
Calm down, Bob!

09:07.862 --> 09:09.263
If you keep exerting yourself,

09:09.331 --> 09:11.133
you're gonna make
your injuries even worse.

09:11.198 --> 09:12.433
Calm down?

09:12.500 --> 09:14.836
This is all your fault!
Jim told me all about it!

09:14.903 --> 09:18.373
Bob, look, relax!

09:18.439 --> 09:20.074
Even if they had more time,
they know this is

09:20.141 --> 09:21.409
just strategic suicide.

09:21.476 --> 09:23.178
Yeah, it was dead last
on their list.

09:23.245 --> 09:25.147
But they have no other
choice and no time, Jim.

09:28.616 --> 09:30.151
Admiral Keller, we have a visual
on some of the drone's damage.

09:30.218 --> 09:32.220
Are we certain that the
antimatter engine

09:32.286 --> 09:34.121
affixed to the top of the
drone is still functional?

09:34.188 --> 09:36.690
Affirmative, the antimatter
engine is functional

09:36.757 --> 09:38.092
but it is programmed
to conserve power

09:38.159 --> 09:39.528
and send a distress signal
if the drone

09:39.595 --> 09:40.596
becomes terminally damaged.

09:40.661 --> 09:42.129
And Paul Lawson's plan...

09:42.197 --> 09:43.664
I have a room full of trigger
happy Joint Chiefs

09:43.731 --> 09:46.434
still doubtful of
our proposed fix.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.036
A nuclear strike will
not stop the Moon.

09:49.103 --> 09:51.372
Clearing the lunar asteroids
with conventional missiles

09:51.438 --> 09:53.908
and using the antimatter drive
to create a Black Hole

09:53.975 --> 09:55.877
is the only way forward.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.578
Okay, but if you don't
launch before an E.M.P

09:57.645 --> 10:00.147
or magnetic pole reversal,
your missiles will be disabled.

10:00.215 --> 10:02.318
The mission rides on you,
Admiral.

10:04.586 --> 10:06.154
Five minutes after launch,

10:06.221 --> 10:09.124
the meteor's destroyed all
the drones except for one.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.226
Now it's dead in space on the
edge of the moon's far side.

10:11.293 --> 10:12.861
But its antimatter engine
is sending

10:12.928 --> 10:15.164
a distress signal right now.

10:15.231 --> 10:17.566
They need someone
who'll reactivate it.

10:17.632 --> 10:20.267
No, they need you
to reactivate it.

10:20.334 --> 10:22.103
Our engineers are somewhat
familiar with it

10:22.170 --> 10:24.073
and they could do basic
diagnostic tests and controls.

10:24.139 --> 10:26.875
But you're the expert
on how it's built.

10:28.209 --> 10:30.211
Jim, you're the only one
that can guarantee

10:30.279 --> 10:33.082
that the reaction will
run out of control.

10:36.550 --> 10:39.720
We're already encountering
E.M. disruptions.

10:39.788 --> 10:42.123
They're only going to intensify.

10:42.189 --> 10:44.625
So I'm sure the Pentagon's
planning a strike?

10:44.693 --> 10:46.327
Yeah.

10:46.394 --> 10:48.297
Hauser's coordinating a global
conventional weapon strike

10:48.362 --> 10:51.065
into a lunar debris field
to clear a path for you

10:51.132 --> 10:52.433
to reach the stalled drone.

10:52.500 --> 10:53.901
And XVision will provide
a space fleet

10:53.968 --> 10:55.637
leading you right into orbit.

10:55.703 --> 10:57.772
But as the moon gets closer,
it's gonna reverse

10:57.840 --> 10:59.108
the earth's magnetic pulse,

10:59.174 --> 11:00.708
detonating the
missiles prematurely.

11:00.775 --> 11:03.879
Okay, we have to ensure that
my launch precedes that

11:03.946 --> 11:05.380
so we don't
compromise the mission.

11:05.447 --> 11:06.881
It's not my first rodeo.

11:06.948 --> 11:08.817
We've timed it so by the time
you get in your spacecraft,

11:08.882 --> 11:10.417
the missiles will launch.

11:10.485 --> 11:12.321
By the time you get to orbit,
they will dissipate,

11:12.388 --> 11:14.690
leaving you a clear path
right to the stalled drone.

11:14.756 --> 11:16.491
All right. Make sure Hauser
uses the Pentagon's

11:16.558 --> 11:19.861
Colossus satellite dish
to maintain communications.

11:19.928 --> 11:21.929
They'll cut through most
of the magnetic noise.

11:21.996 --> 11:23.931
Colossus satellite dish
will already

11:23.999 --> 11:25.868
be aligned to your jet path.

11:25.934 --> 11:26.868
I got it.

11:26.934 --> 11:28.002
All right.

11:28.068 --> 11:29.570
One more thing.

11:29.638 --> 11:31.807
Under no circumstances,
can Global Defense

11:31.874 --> 11:33.409
change your mind
about a nuclear option.

11:33.475 --> 11:36.845
A nuke and its gamma rays
will fry me and the spacecraft

11:36.910 --> 11:38.279
and the mission ends.

11:38.347 --> 11:42.250
Well, Hauser stopped all
that talk... for now.

11:42.317 --> 11:43.619
Although China and
Russia are considering

11:43.685 --> 11:44.685
a nuclear strike regardless.

11:44.752 --> 11:46.087
Of course.

11:46.154 --> 11:48.088
Yeah, it's the Russians.
What do you expect?

11:48.155 --> 11:51.492
If it wasn't for XVision
and NASA's global reputation,

11:51.559 --> 11:53.395
hell, they might not
have held off at all.

11:54.462 --> 11:55.463
Hold on!

11:55.529 --> 11:58.332
We're about 30 miles out
from base.

11:58.399 --> 12:00.501
That power surge
blew the circuit.

12:00.568 --> 12:01.502
It damaged the propeller.

12:01.569 --> 12:02.803
Damn!

12:02.871 --> 12:04.573
You ever flown these
things before?

12:04.640 --> 12:05.674
It's just basic aeronautics.

12:05.741 --> 12:07.109
Roll, pitch, yaw.

12:07.175 --> 12:10.177
All right.
The rotor's running 19,000 rpm.

12:10.245 --> 12:12.548
Well, we have to equalize it.

12:12.614 --> 12:14.583
- Where's the main circuit?
- It's right here.

12:17.218 --> 12:19.820
The drone's default is
arc flight at 260 knots.

12:19.888 --> 12:21.423
We're not flying coast to coast.

12:21.489 --> 12:24.093
We don't need to account
for the earth's curvature.

12:25.427 --> 12:26.629
There.

12:27.862 --> 12:30.765
All right, I turned off the arc.

12:30.832 --> 12:33.568
That stopped an rpm increase
to the other three rotors.

12:33.635 --> 12:36.804
Now they can match the damaged
rotor without damaging our ETA.

12:36.871 --> 12:38.506
Good.

12:38.573 --> 12:40.675
You know, you place way too much
blind faith in these machines.

12:40.741 --> 12:43.312
Yeah, well, I guess it could be
another thing we disagree on.

12:45.212 --> 12:46.147
Lawson to Base!

12:46.213 --> 12:48.750
Repeat, Lawson to Ba...

12:48.817 --> 12:49.985
Lawson to Base!

12:50.052 --> 12:53.055
Repeat! Damn it!

12:53.121 --> 12:55.155
The E.M.P.s are already
getting our satellites.

12:55.222 --> 12:57.157
Or they could have been
struck by lunar asteroids.

12:57.225 --> 12:58.994
Yeah, that could be it.

13:03.631 --> 13:05.065
No! No!

13:06.934 --> 13:08.502
Oh, God!

13:08.569 --> 13:09.570
Jim!

13:12.606 --> 13:14.742
Lawson to Base, come in!

13:14.809 --> 13:16.844
Lawson to Base, do you hear me?

13:16.910 --> 13:18.513
Lawson to Base!

13:36.531 --> 13:38.499
Oh, sh...

13:38.566 --> 13:41.403
Paul, you okay?

13:41.470 --> 13:43.972
Ah! Ah!

13:44.039 --> 13:46.774
Buckle up, we're going down!

13:46.841 --> 13:48.342
Oh, Jim!

13:48.409 --> 13:49.510
Jim!

14:11.199 --> 14:12.433
Let's stop here.

14:20.542 --> 14:22.310
This is Private
First Class Malcolm

14:22.376 --> 14:25.178
requesting emergency evac.
Over.

14:25.246 --> 14:26.914
<i>This is Squadron 229.</i>

14:26.981 --> 14:30.351
<i>We have a report of major
damage to Camp Pendleton.</i>

14:30.418 --> 14:33.520
Camp Pendleton was just
destroyed in a major earthquake.

14:33.587 --> 14:36.323
Requesting emergency evac
to the nearest bunker.

14:36.390 --> 14:38.626
<i>Evac denied, we are under
strict orders</i>

14:38.693 --> 14:40.562
<i>to only address the
most dire threats.</i>

14:40.629 --> 14:42.598
<i>We're also getting reports
the earthquake triggered</i>

14:42.664 --> 14:44.433
<i>a massive tsunami.
You will need to get</i>

14:44.499 --> 14:46.101
<i>to high ground immediately.</i>

14:46.168 --> 14:48.135
229, we are en route
to a communications hub

14:48.202 --> 14:50.637
to maintain
the southwest network.

14:50.704 --> 14:52.707
<i>I understand, private,
but all units</i>

14:52.775 --> 14:54.308
<i>are for essential support only.</i>

14:54.375 --> 14:56.343
<i>Unless you're directly
supporting the Pentagon,</i>

14:56.410 --> 14:58.946
<i>we cannot evac. Copy?</i>

14:59.013 --> 15:01.917
This is communications support
for the entire region.

15:01.982 --> 15:03.483
<i>Denied, private.</i>

15:03.550 --> 15:05.786
<i>We have direct orders from DOD
that all assets</i>

15:05.853 --> 15:08.723
<i>are dedicated
to the larger threat.</i>

15:08.789 --> 15:13.661
Hey, tell them you're traveling
with Stacey Lawson.

15:13.727 --> 15:15.296
I'm Jim Lawson's wife.

15:15.362 --> 15:18.999
He's the astronaut they
recruited for their mission.

15:19.067 --> 15:22.137
229, I have Stacey Lawson
accompanying me.

15:22.202 --> 15:24.505
She is astronaut
Jim Lawson's wife

15:24.572 --> 15:28.176
and Jim Lawson
is mission critical.

15:28.242 --> 15:29.743
<i>Denied, Private Ninan.</i>

15:29.810 --> 15:31.812
<i>Command says she's not
mission critical.</i>

15:31.879 --> 15:34.215
<i>I'm sorry, there are
no available units</i>

15:34.281 --> 15:36.517
<i>for a one-off rescue.</i>

15:36.584 --> 15:38.519
Are you really
Jim Lawson's wife?

15:38.587 --> 15:39.721
I am...

15:40.989 --> 15:42.324
Or was.

15:44.625 --> 15:46.060
We separated.

15:46.127 --> 15:47.961
Well...

15:48.029 --> 15:50.731
They have
a communications dish

15:50.799 --> 15:53.202
outside the Pentagon
called Colossus.

15:53.268 --> 15:56.671
It's huge.
It transmits deep into space.

15:56.737 --> 16:00.775
But with the fragments of the
moon deflecting the signal,

16:00.842 --> 16:03.178
they'll need us
to reroute all the hubs

16:03.245 --> 16:08.049
across the country to boost
their signal, including ours.

16:08.116 --> 16:10.351
That's what this is for.

16:10.418 --> 16:13.154
It'll convert
our regional signal

16:13.222 --> 16:14.856
into something they can use.

16:19.260 --> 16:20.696
You ready to keep running?

16:23.097 --> 16:24.332
Absolutely.

16:44.117 --> 16:45.520
I'm sorry.

16:48.856 --> 16:50.258
All right.

16:50.324 --> 16:52.359
So base still has our
approximate location.

16:52.427 --> 16:54.029
As soon as they see
a distress signal,

16:54.096 --> 16:56.498
they send us
a rescue unit, so...

16:56.564 --> 16:57.998
Thermal imaging
should still be able

16:58.066 --> 16:59.534
to pick us up on the ground.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.402
But they're gonna need
a clear place to land.

17:01.468 --> 17:02.603
Let's get out in the open.

17:02.670 --> 17:04.238
- Let's go.
- Come on.

17:07.175 --> 17:08.877
There goes our rescue detail.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.413
The EM disturbances
must be getting worse.

17:11.478 --> 17:14.615
- They look like our UMVs.
- Glad no-one was on board.

17:14.681 --> 17:16.584
Man, if we don't get you
airborne soon, we're done.

17:16.651 --> 17:18.285
Yeah. If we don't get
a missile strike,

17:18.352 --> 17:21.221
our chances of success
are cut in half. Come on.

17:21.288 --> 17:22.623
Come on what?

17:22.689 --> 17:24.391
Base has got to be
about five miles away.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.894
I think we're about a mile
from George's mechanic.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.996
George's mecha... what?
Dad's Air Force buddy?

17:29.063 --> 17:31.832
Yeah, the guy who fixes your
base's cars for a handshake.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.601
That was some
sweet deal you made.

17:33.668 --> 17:36.036
We can use his phone,
grab one of his cars.

17:36.103 --> 17:38.407
Let's go.

17:38.473 --> 17:40.209
I hate running.

17:46.280 --> 17:47.882
- Hey.
- God...

17:47.948 --> 17:49.217
What are you doing?

17:49.284 --> 17:51.018
- What?
- What is that?

17:51.085 --> 17:52.319
I don't like hair in my face.

17:52.387 --> 17:54.188
You carry that thing with you?

17:54.255 --> 17:56.323
- Yeah.
- It's very fashionable.

17:56.390 --> 17:59.127
Oh, sweet boots.
You get 'em at Costco?

17:59.194 --> 18:00.395
I hope it makes you run faster.

18:00.460 --> 18:02.697
Come on, Sally!

18:02.764 --> 18:05.567
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait!

18:05.633 --> 18:08.568
Oh...
Oh, I felt all that.

18:08.636 --> 18:09.771
How long did that take us?

18:09.838 --> 18:10.772
What?

18:10.839 --> 18:13.674
How long did it take us?

18:13.740 --> 18:15.242
Six minutes.
That's not even that bad.

18:15.310 --> 18:16.244
Let's keep going.

18:16.311 --> 18:17.379
Let's go. Come on.

18:17.445 --> 18:18.312
Whoa, whoa!

18:18.379 --> 18:20.082
You're not running.

18:20.148 --> 18:22.083
You're emptying your wallets,
giving your money to J.J. here.

18:22.150 --> 18:23.450
And then you're
getting zip-tied.

18:23.517 --> 18:24.552
Look, we don't have
any time for this.

18:24.619 --> 18:25.753
Okay, we got...

18:25.820 --> 18:27.222
- Hey!
- All right, all right.

18:27.287 --> 18:28.589
All right.

18:30.792 --> 18:32.727
The only way you two clowns
are out this far

18:32.794 --> 18:34.496
is if you're working for
that Air Force Base.

18:34.563 --> 18:37.564
You know, we got your
little alert back in town.

18:37.631 --> 18:39.566
And we know you're lying
about the end of the world.

18:39.633 --> 18:41.201
You got us, okay?
We work for the air force...

18:41.268 --> 18:44.005
Move, and I will blow your
brains all over this ravine!

18:44.072 --> 18:46.306
I knew your private military
was out here

18:46.373 --> 18:48.242
trying to take over
this whole region.

18:48.310 --> 18:50.477
I read about it
online for years now.

18:50.544 --> 18:52.380
We don't know anything
about that, okay?

18:52.447 --> 18:53.880
We're just trying to get
to the base to fix it.

18:53.948 --> 18:55.283
Hands up!
Hands up!

18:55.350 --> 18:56.284
We're just trying to get
to get to the base

18:56.350 --> 18:57.986
to fix it, all right?

18:58.053 --> 18:59.286
Wait a second...

19:00.854 --> 19:03.056
Hey, Annie.
Look who it is.

19:03.123 --> 19:04.959
It's that CEO.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.264
That's him.

19:09.331 --> 19:10.698
Look, we don't want any trouble.

19:10.765 --> 19:13.000
Put your wallet on the ground!
Both of you!

19:13.067 --> 19:14.000
All right, all right, all right.

19:14.067 --> 19:15.602
Now!

19:15.669 --> 19:17.906
Guys like you, Elon Musk,
Mark Zuckerberg,

19:17.973 --> 19:20.608
pigs feeding off society,
crushing our brains.

19:20.675 --> 19:23.544
You had your time lying to us,

19:23.611 --> 19:25.514
lying about taking
expeditions to the moon.

19:25.580 --> 19:27.948
Yeah, we've been
watching you, too.

19:28.015 --> 19:30.951
We know you been keeping tabs on
every citizen in this country.

19:32.687 --> 19:34.389
So why don't you tell me?

19:34.456 --> 19:37.091
How does it feel, Paul Lawson?

19:37.158 --> 19:40.861
J.J., I knew we would
find private military

19:40.928 --> 19:42.163
out here patrolling.

19:42.229 --> 19:46.066
Now's the time.
Take a video.

19:46.133 --> 19:48.102
The revolution starts here.

19:48.169 --> 19:50.871
Guys, we are
a spacecraft company, okay?

19:50.938 --> 19:53.440
There really is a threat to the
United States, the whole world!

19:53.507 --> 19:54.708
He's lying, J.J.

19:54.775 --> 19:55.909
Good thing I'm recording this.

19:55.976 --> 19:57.711
Oh, oh, wait!
Don't kill us!

19:57.777 --> 19:59.480
Paul, the bullies when
you were eight, you remember?

19:59.547 --> 20:01.114
- You two shut up!
- Shut up!

20:01.181 --> 20:02.784
Hey!

20:04.052 --> 20:05.153
Wait, wait, wait!

20:05.219 --> 20:06.554
What?

20:10.024 --> 20:11.293
How does that work?

20:11.360 --> 20:12.860
I don't know,
you yell loud enough,

20:12.927 --> 20:14.495
they think you gonna
tell 'em something important.

20:14.562 --> 20:15.996
Worked when you were
eight, worked now.

20:17.698 --> 20:20.134
Lose that ridiculous
beanie, will you?

20:20.201 --> 20:22.871
Keeps my hair outta my face.

20:22.938 --> 20:24.639
This shop is just through
this clearing.

20:24.705 --> 20:26.541
We're kind of in the middle
of nowhere.

20:33.281 --> 20:34.815
Oh, ho!

20:34.881 --> 20:36.784
There's George's shop!
Keep going!

20:36.851 --> 20:38.018
God damn!

20:41.922 --> 20:43.257
George!

20:43.324 --> 20:45.860
Hey, George!

20:45.927 --> 20:48.262
Get us a car.
I'll call the base.

20:48.329 --> 20:49.464
George!

20:49.531 --> 20:51.332
Hey! George!

20:51.399 --> 20:53.834
Hey, it's Jimmy Lawson!

20:53.901 --> 20:54.634
Got anything?

20:54.701 --> 20:56.102
Yeah, it's working.

20:56.169 --> 20:58.907
We gotta be close to
an hour ETA for impact.

20:58.973 --> 21:01.443
Hour and 16 minutes 'til
it reaches the mesosphere.

21:01.509 --> 21:03.544
Exhibition... this
is Operation Godfather.

21:03.611 --> 21:05.345
Get me the Command Center.

21:05.412 --> 21:07.314
Lawson, Admiral Keller here.
We lost you on radar.

21:07.380 --> 21:09.883
I'm on the line with Colonel
Hauser at the Pentagon.

21:09.950 --> 21:11.685
Jim and I need a rescue ASAP.

21:11.753 --> 21:15.289
We lost your GPS on our
Colossus Dish minutes ago.

21:15.355 --> 21:16.957
<i>Keller, get Lawson to base</i>

21:17.025 --> 21:19.294
<i>before these electromagnetic
pulses get worse.</i>

21:19.361 --> 21:20.962
We sent out rescue helicopters,

21:21.028 --> 21:23.330
but their guidance systems
went out of control and crashed.

21:23.397 --> 21:24.765
We sent out two more.

21:24.832 --> 21:26.200
Both those transports
have since crashed.

21:26.267 --> 21:28.736
Have your flight captain
take the XVision fleet

21:28.803 --> 21:30.371
to your underground bunker
to shield them

21:30.438 --> 21:32.239
from the electromagnetic pulses.

21:32.306 --> 21:33.807
Yes, ma'am.

21:33.874 --> 21:35.108
<i>Is the antimatter engine
on the stranded drone</i>

21:35.176 --> 21:36.110
<i>still sending a signal?</i>

21:36.177 --> 21:37.178
Affirmative.

21:37.245 --> 21:38.880
What's the mission status?

21:38.947 --> 21:40.380
<i>I have word from the president
and the Joint Chiefs</i>

21:40.448 --> 21:42.417
that China and Russia
are synchronized

21:42.484 --> 21:44.419
to launch their nuclear payload.

21:44.486 --> 21:45.853
<i>Once they detonate,</i>

21:45.920 --> 21:47.721
Jim will have a safe path
to reach the drone.

21:47.788 --> 21:49.056
Jim and I are headed
to the base ASAP.

21:49.123 --> 21:50.691
<i>We gotta get Jim
here now, Paul.</i>

21:50.758 --> 21:52.360
Threat Response
reported electrical damage

21:52.426 --> 21:53.895
to our Colossus Dish.

21:53.961 --> 21:56.096
<i>The longer we delay,
the less chance we have</i>

21:56.163 --> 21:58.231
<i>to assist if our
guidance system fails.</i>

21:58.298 --> 21:59.299
I understand.

21:59.367 --> 22:00.769
Hey, George!

22:02.137 --> 22:03.371
You here?

22:03.438 --> 22:04.973
Hey, George?

22:05.974 --> 22:07.375
Come on, George.

22:07.441 --> 22:10.144
And NASA's reporting such
a dense lunar asteroid field

22:10.211 --> 22:11.578
that the pathway will
close roughly

22:11.646 --> 22:13.313
one minute after the strike.

22:13.380 --> 22:15.416
<i>So Jim has to follow directly
behind the strike zone</i>

22:15.483 --> 22:18.220
<i>to avoid destroying
the antimatter engine.</i>

22:26.092 --> 22:28.063
Oh!

22:32.566 --> 22:33.700
Paul?

22:33.767 --> 22:35.201
Paul, are you there?

22:35.268 --> 22:36.871
Come in, Paul!

22:36.938 --> 22:38.073
I'm here.

22:38.139 --> 22:40.140
<i>These earthquakes
are getting worse.</i>

22:40.207 --> 22:42.042
Get here now while
you still can!

22:42.109 --> 22:43.945
Jim and I are headed
to the road ASAP.

22:44.012 --> 22:46.648
<i>Once we get on the road,
I need all defensive personnel</i>

22:46.715 --> 22:48.448
to maintain communication
on an open channel.

22:48.515 --> 22:50.215
I have zero
digital communication,

22:50.217 --> 22:51.451
repeat, zero digital
communication.

22:51.518 --> 22:52.686
I need live updates.

22:52.753 --> 22:54.155
Copy that.
You will have them.

22:59.060 --> 23:00.061
Paul!

23:01.662 --> 23:03.130
George!

23:22.483 --> 23:25.820
Jimmy? Is that you?

23:25.887 --> 23:27.421
Pull yourself out when I lift!

23:27.487 --> 23:28.688
Now!

23:28.755 --> 23:31.258
Come on!

23:31.325 --> 23:32.593
Jimmy!

23:35.929 --> 23:37.898
Jim?

23:37.965 --> 23:39.400
Jim?

23:39.467 --> 23:40.735
Paul!

23:40.802 --> 23:42.169
- Oh, shit!
- Come on, Paul.

23:42.236 --> 23:43.169
Jim!

23:43.236 --> 23:44.471
Come on, okay.

23:44.538 --> 23:45.439
Jim, what the
hell are you doing?

23:45.505 --> 23:46.440
Oh, yeah, yeah, ready?

23:46.507 --> 23:47.440
One, two...

23:49.043 --> 23:50.277
Okay, get underneath,
underneath. Go underneath!

23:50.343 --> 23:51.446
All right. You ready?

23:51.513 --> 23:52.380
- Go, go, go...
- You got it?

23:52.447 --> 23:53.380
One, two, go!

23:57.384 --> 23:59.252
Come on! Slide out!
Slide out! I got you!

23:59.320 --> 24:01.188
Come on, come on.

24:05.126 --> 24:06.661
Drop, drop, drop.

24:09.196 --> 24:11.832
Are you good?
Got any breaks?

24:11.900 --> 24:15.669
No, he's just gonna
be bruised for a long time.

24:15.736 --> 24:17.838
I was just out back
turning off the gas

24:17.905 --> 24:19.073
when I heard you guys yelling.

24:19.139 --> 24:21.409
Hey, look, we need
a car right now.

24:21.476 --> 24:22.709
We'll take you to the base.

24:22.776 --> 24:24.577
All right,
I got you covered, man.

24:24.644 --> 24:25.746
I got just the one.

24:25.813 --> 24:27.046
Great.
Where are the keys?

24:27.113 --> 24:29.217
Back there on the shelf,
number eight.

24:29.284 --> 24:31.419
- On the board?
- Yeah. You can't miss it.

24:31.485 --> 24:32.654
All right.

24:32.719 --> 24:34.287
- You good?
- Your brother.

24:34.354 --> 24:35.723
Oh, no.

24:35.790 --> 24:37.691
A thank you would
have been nice, all right?

24:37.757 --> 24:39.393
Shit, nothing changes
around here.

24:51.072 --> 24:53.174
Before he went to the Air Force,

24:53.240 --> 24:56.342
your dad had that
on his workbench.

24:56.409 --> 24:59.412
Every day he'd look at it.
Man, I forgot all about it.

24:59.479 --> 25:01.481
You know what? Take it.
I want you to have it, Jimmy.

25:01.548 --> 25:03.049
For good luck.

25:03.117 --> 25:05.186
Thanks.

25:05.253 --> 25:07.989
Guys, I'm sorry I never made it
to your dad's funeral.

25:08.055 --> 25:09.689
Hey, George, It's all right.

25:09.756 --> 25:11.525
I was just...

25:11.592 --> 25:13.361
What's our ETA to impact?

25:13.428 --> 25:14.996
We got an hour and 12 minutes.
We gotta go.

25:15.063 --> 25:16.764
All right, come on.
Let's go.

25:16.831 --> 25:18.433
George.

25:21.401 --> 25:23.170
Thanks, George.

25:23.236 --> 25:27.675
Hey, man, she's is a
nitrous-burning monster!

25:27.742 --> 25:30.111
Zero to 100 in a second!

25:37.584 --> 25:38.885
George!

25:38.951 --> 25:40.053
- Come on.
- George!

25:40.121 --> 25:41.255
Come on, Jim!
We gotta go!

25:41.322 --> 25:42.622
Come on!

25:42.689 --> 25:44.359
We gotta go!
Come on!

25:52.265 --> 25:55.269
Go, go. Step on it.
Go, go, go.

26:05.080 --> 26:05.880
You good?

26:05.946 --> 26:07.448
Which way to the base?

26:07.515 --> 26:08.816
Straight west.

26:13.053 --> 26:16.122
Base, this is Lawson.
Do you copy?

26:16.189 --> 26:19.326
Base! This is Lawson!
Do you copy?

26:19.393 --> 26:21.662
<i>This is Admiral Keller,
Lawson, at XVision.</i>

26:21.728 --> 26:22.764
<i>Go for base.</i>

26:22.831 --> 26:24.198
Jim and I are three minutes out.

26:24.265 --> 26:26.566
Repeat, ETA is three minutes.
Do you copy?

26:26.633 --> 26:27.900
<i>Copy, three minutes.</i>

26:27.967 --> 26:29.169
We're currently tracking
your position

26:29.236 --> 26:31.238
with the Xvision
surveillance drones,

26:31.305 --> 26:34.107
so we'll have a more accurate
sense of your ETA.

26:34.175 --> 26:35.842
We've sustained massive
damage here at the base

26:35.909 --> 26:37.378
due to these earthquakes.

26:37.444 --> 26:39.914
<i>Some parts have
been completely decimated.</i>

26:39.979 --> 26:41.548
<i>Most of our F-35s</i>

26:41.615 --> 26:44.718
<i>and about 80% of all
aircraft are operational.</i>

26:44.784 --> 26:46.688
XVision craft is
ready to launch.

26:46.755 --> 26:48.421
We're just waiting
for your arrival.

26:48.488 --> 26:49.789
Copy that, base.

26:49.857 --> 26:51.192
Maintain protocol
on Operation Godfather.

26:51.258 --> 26:52.325
<i>Copy that.</i>

26:52.392 --> 26:54.227
You should have
visual confirmation

26:54.294 --> 26:57.398
of conventional weapons now
at 50,000 units and climbing.

27:00.868 --> 27:02.069
Good. They launched early,
get ahead of

27:02.136 --> 27:04.505
the earth's magnetic
poles reversing.

27:04.572 --> 27:07.708
What's the ETA for the moon?

27:07.775 --> 27:10.111
It's an hour
and eight minutes.

27:10.178 --> 27:11.779
All right. See if you can find
something on the radio,

27:11.844 --> 27:13.213
a newscast, anything.

27:16.350 --> 27:18.986
<i>...numbers of casualties,
and we're getting reports</i>

27:19.053 --> 27:21.255
<i>of New York, Orlando...</i>

27:21.322 --> 27:25.191
<i>coastal cities experiencing
unprecedented...</i>

27:25.258 --> 27:26.760
- <i>Japan.</i>
- There it is!

27:26.828 --> 27:28.729
<i>All of the
Canary islands, Alaska,</i>

27:28.795 --> 27:31.099
<i>all in the states of...</i>

27:32.065 --> 27:34.134
I see it.
Just focus, brother.

27:34.201 --> 27:36.136
We need to get to base.

27:43.977 --> 27:46.147
Admiral, exterior damage
readings on the base

27:46.213 --> 27:48.783
have overwhelmed our
damage-report live-stream.

27:48.850 --> 27:50.217
Moving to the back-up feed.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.920
Thank you, Major Romero.

27:53.987 --> 27:55.189
Colonel Hauser...

27:59.226 --> 28:02.563
China and Russia are chomping at
the bit to launch their nukes.

28:02.630 --> 28:03.864
Is Lawson airborne?

28:03.930 --> 28:05.165
Negative.
His helicopter crashed,

28:05.233 --> 28:06.900
but we've regained
communication.

28:06.967 --> 28:08.835
He's en route to the base
about one minute out.

28:08.902 --> 28:11.270
We need him airborne
as of an hour ago.

28:11.338 --> 28:14.275
We have Operation Godfather
on our threat screen.

28:14.342 --> 28:16.009
We launched our missiles
to get ahead of

28:16.075 --> 28:17.845
the reversal of
Earth's magnetic poles.

28:17.911 --> 28:19.579
They're reaching
the mesosphere as we speak.

28:19.647 --> 28:22.450
We will have Jim Lawson
airborne ASAP once he arrives.

28:25.652 --> 28:28.988
Ma'am, an incoming meteor has
damaged above ground supports.

28:29.055 --> 28:31.225
Below ground damage
is 20 yards at 5%.

28:31.292 --> 28:33.327
Admiral, per the president

28:33.393 --> 28:35.596
and the Joint Chiefs,
make it happen.

28:37.864 --> 28:39.632
If Lawson doesn't tail
this strike,

28:39.699 --> 28:42.469
every second decreases
our chance of success.

28:42.536 --> 28:43.603
Yes, ma'am.

28:43.670 --> 28:45.439
Our Colossus Dish is damaged.

28:45.505 --> 28:47.941
Communication to the antimatter
engine is unstable.

28:48.008 --> 28:49.611
Do you have steady contact?

28:49.677 --> 28:51.678
Initializing communications
verification

28:51.746 --> 28:52.979
with anti-matter engine now.

28:54.747 --> 28:56.115
Signal still active.

28:56.182 --> 28:57.684
The signal on the
antimatter engine

28:57.752 --> 28:59.453
on the drone is active, yes.

28:59.519 --> 29:01.755
How much life is left
in its power reserve?

29:01.822 --> 29:04.558
Last reading was 72%.

29:04.624 --> 29:06.560
Are you able to patch
this call over to Lawson?

29:06.628 --> 29:10.731
I have a very unstable radio
signal, but it's all I've got.

29:10.796 --> 29:12.065
Do it.

29:12.132 --> 29:13.333
Yes, ma'am.

29:16.370 --> 29:18.138
- Admiral?
- <i>It's Hauser.</i>

29:18.205 --> 29:20.241
<i>I can't hold Russia and
China back</i>

29:20.307 --> 29:22.309
<i>from launching their nuclear
missiles much longer.</i>

29:22.377 --> 29:24.544
They seem to think that they can
solve this with a nuke strike.

29:24.611 --> 29:26.514
A nuke strike
won't work, Colonel!

29:26.580 --> 29:29.582
The only thing that'll stop it
is a major gravitational event.

29:29.650 --> 29:31.485
We both know that, Jim.

29:31.552 --> 29:33.120
But their physicists
seem to think

29:33.187 --> 29:35.455
that our process isn't viable.

29:35.522 --> 29:38.525
We need to convince them before
they take us all down with them.

29:38.592 --> 29:41.094
Colonel, that antimatter
engine is a miniature version

29:41.161 --> 29:42.929
of the large Hadron Collider.

29:42.996 --> 29:44.664
That makes black
holes every single day.

29:44.732 --> 29:47.835
So it is strong enough to create
a temporary black hole

29:47.901 --> 29:49.403
the size of a football field

29:49.469 --> 29:51.371
pulling the moon
back into orbit.

29:51.438 --> 29:53.774
The Russians and Chinese
are saying that a black hole

29:53.841 --> 29:57.111
will pull the moon and the earth
into it, destroying everything.

29:57.177 --> 29:59.580
That's not true, Colonel!

29:59.646 --> 30:02.015
<i>They're going with the nuclear
option unless we can prove it.</i>

30:02.082 --> 30:03.116
<i>Do we have proof?</i>

30:03.182 --> 30:04.451
Yes! It's something called

30:04.518 --> 30:07.521
"Newton's Universal Law
of Gravitation".

30:07.588 --> 30:10.024
<i>Gravity decreases
in an inverse square</i>

30:10.091 --> 30:12.627
when moving away from
the center of a mass.

30:12.692 --> 30:15.261
Colonel, the drone is
on the moon's far side.

30:15.329 --> 30:16.830
So the earth is far enough away

30:16.897 --> 30:19.198
from the event that
it'll only move a millimeter.

30:19.265 --> 30:21.601
But that'll be enough to pull
the moon back into orbit

30:21.669 --> 30:24.405
and back into equilibrium
with the earth. Copy.

30:24.470 --> 30:27.474
Let's hope that
it's enough to ward them off.

30:27.542 --> 30:28.543
Get it done.

30:39.653 --> 30:41.721
Ma'am, the Colossus Dish
has sustained heavy damage.

30:41.787 --> 30:44.424
We've lost the distress signal
to the antimatter engine.

30:44.492 --> 30:46.594
We're losing
its location, ma'am.

30:48.562 --> 30:51.899
Threat Response,
this is Command.

30:51.966 --> 30:55.769
Get above ground and repair
the Colossus Dish immediately.

30:55.835 --> 30:58.639
If Lawson loses contact,
that dish is the only thing

30:58.706 --> 31:01.308
powerful enough to communicate
the drone's coordinates.

31:01.374 --> 31:03.743
Ma'am, radar indicates
Operation Godfather

31:03.811 --> 31:05.379
clearing the mesosphere.

31:05.446 --> 31:08.416
Lieutenant, when they strike,
get me a payload count.

31:11.083 --> 31:12.553
Colonel, we have
incoming meteors.

31:12.620 --> 31:14.655
We have to find some
way to defend the dish.

31:14.721 --> 31:16.455
Threat Response
is calling for artillery.

31:16.523 --> 31:17.791
No.

31:17.858 --> 31:19.326
If we use artillery, we
might as well be trying

31:19.392 --> 31:20.960
to stop them with a pistol.

31:21.027 --> 31:23.362
Diaz, get Threat Response
to set up

31:23.429 --> 31:25.699
the LRAD sonic cannons
around the dish.

31:27.501 --> 31:29.570
We'll launch a
sonic shield

31:29.637 --> 31:31.105
to pulverize incoming
as it approaches.

31:31.171 --> 31:32.739
Deploying sonic cannons, ma'am.

31:40.313 --> 31:43.551
Major Romero, how's the base's
earthquake stabilization?

31:43.618 --> 31:45.653
Stabilizers are
still active, ma'am.

31:45.719 --> 31:47.653
And the underground
line to the Pentagon?

31:47.720 --> 31:49.856
Still active.

31:49.923 --> 31:51.358
Ma'am, the missiles have reached

31:51.425 --> 31:53.761
the leading edge of
the moon's debris field.

31:56.396 --> 31:59.267
Field penetration at 18%,

31:59.332 --> 32:04.738
30 degrees,
ordinance detonation at 31%.

32:09.376 --> 32:11.679
<i>Absolute carnage...
it is the end times...</i>

32:11.746 --> 32:15.850
<i>I have reports of
satellites crashing...</i>

32:15.917 --> 32:18.686
<i>Words cannot... Now we can see
whole structures...</i>

32:18.753 --> 32:21.621
<i>around Paris...
our own station now...</i>

32:27.695 --> 32:30.831
Hey, the magnetic poles
are reversing.

32:30.898 --> 32:32.400
Oh...

32:35.736 --> 32:36.736
Hit the nitrous!

32:36.803 --> 32:37.871
What?

32:37.938 --> 32:39.607
Hit the nitrous!
In the console!

32:39.673 --> 32:41.607
Oh, God! Oh!

32:41.675 --> 32:43.443
Hit it!

32:43.509 --> 32:45.344
Oh!

32:45.411 --> 32:46.913
- Hang on!
- Here we go!

32:46.980 --> 32:48.448
Hold on! Hold on!

32:50.985 --> 32:54.222
Woo! Woo-hoo-hoo!

32:59.692 --> 33:05.799
Ordinance detonation
at 38%, 50%,

33:05.867 --> 33:08.502
60%...

33:08.569 --> 33:09.670
80%.

33:11.438 --> 33:14.073
We're still at 18% penetration
into the debris field

33:14.140 --> 33:16.544
and holding...

33:16.610 --> 33:18.477
Holding...

33:18.544 --> 33:19.845
and 17%.

33:19.912 --> 33:22.782
The missiles are prematurely
to detonating, ma'am.

33:22.850 --> 33:26.852
The earth's magnetic fields
are reversing.

33:28.421 --> 33:30.423
Ma'am, I'm also getting
a heat sensor reading

33:30.489 --> 33:32.892
from the stabilizers
underneath the base.

33:32.959 --> 33:36.095
Rate of increase is
one degree per second.

33:36.162 --> 33:37.830
All right, stand by.

33:37.898 --> 33:39.867
<i>Ma'am, we have to get our
spacecraft in the air now.</i>

33:39.934 --> 33:42.002
<i>These earthquakes will
destroy our craft any minute!</i>

33:42.067 --> 33:43.770
<i>What is Jim's ETA?</i>

33:43.836 --> 33:46.338
Captain Hayes, stand by until
I give you the order to launch!

33:46.406 --> 33:47.875
Stand by, Captain Hayes.

33:50.044 --> 33:52.379
The moon's weakening
the earth's magnetic field,

33:52.446 --> 33:53.914
sending subatomic particles
shooting

33:53.980 --> 33:55.248
through the upper atmosphere.

33:57.650 --> 34:01.388
Ma'am, I'm getting a security
alert from the Pentagon.

34:01.455 --> 34:03.491
The pole reversal is
activating the detonator,

34:03.557 --> 34:06.892
destroying the missiles before
they can reach the debris field.

34:06.959 --> 34:08.661
Stand by, Romero.

34:08.728 --> 34:11.063
I'm getting an alert that
the Pentagon's Colossus Dish

34:11.130 --> 34:13.667
is experiencing a power surge.

34:13.733 --> 34:16.803
Do we still have
a line to Washington?

34:16.869 --> 34:18.505
Still connected
to the Pentagon, ma'am.

34:18.572 --> 34:20.340
All right. Put me through
to Colonel Hauser.

34:25.545 --> 34:27.380
Ma'am, the cannons are down.

34:27.447 --> 34:29.215
And the dish's
mainframe is overheating.

34:30.449 --> 34:31.751
It's Admiral Keller, ma'am.

34:31.818 --> 34:33.985
I see zero confirmation
of his flight!

34:34.053 --> 34:36.356
Get Lawson in the air now!

34:39.458 --> 34:41.395
This is astronaut
Jim Lawson to base.

34:41.460 --> 34:43.697
<i>We are at XVision!</i>

34:43.764 --> 34:45.297
Start the engine on my craft.

34:45.364 --> 34:47.667
I'll be airborne as soon
as I reach the cockpit.

34:47.733 --> 34:50.502
He's here and about
to board, Colonel.

34:50.570 --> 34:52.039
Copy that, Captain Lawson.

34:52.103 --> 34:54.172
All spacecraft are prepped
and ready to launch.

34:54.239 --> 34:57.244
<i>You are at point position.
Repeat, you are at point.</i>

34:57.311 --> 34:59.579
Captain Hayes,
initiate launch sequence.

34:59.646 --> 35:02.717
Jim Lawson is on his way
to fleet point position.

35:02.782 --> 35:04.951
Hayes and Matthews,
you're running the edge.

35:05.017 --> 35:06.387
<i>Ready to launch.</i>

35:06.454 --> 35:08.053
<i>Assuming left flank
to the point.</i>

35:08.121 --> 35:13.193
Ma'am, the temperature under the
base has increased 300 degrees.

35:13.260 --> 35:16.564
Our pressure readings
are blowing out the sensors.

35:17.631 --> 35:19.367
The building stabilizers
are melting.

35:40.053 --> 35:42.423
Looks like it's
some type of geode.

35:43.990 --> 35:46.360
Did this just come up
from under the base?

35:46.425 --> 35:51.497
The last temperature
reading was 380 degrees.

35:51.564 --> 35:55.468
The sensors are showing
a heat field at...

35:55.535 --> 35:57.771
100 feet below ground!

35:57.838 --> 35:59.805
Alert Lawson.

35:59.872 --> 36:02.842
They might be driving right
into a volcanic eruption.

36:06.046 --> 36:09.916
Ma'am, I'm getting an alert
from the power grid database.

36:09.983 --> 36:13.053
All the power grids
in the U.S. are crashing

36:13.119 --> 36:15.522
because the magnetic
poles are reversing.

36:20.427 --> 36:22.662
<i>This is Captain Hayes.
Ready to launch.</i>

36:22.729 --> 36:25.298
There's the fleet.
There's the fleet right there!

36:25.365 --> 36:28.235
The engine's starting
to overheat.

36:28.302 --> 36:30.803
The tarmac's heating up.
The tires are starting to smoke.

36:30.871 --> 36:33.506
Yeah, the moon's pulling on
the earth's liquid core.

36:33.573 --> 36:35.207
That's pushing magma
to the surface.

36:35.275 --> 36:37.110
All right, we're gonna drive
right up to the craft,

36:37.177 --> 36:39.679
get on the roof of the car, up
the ladder into the cockpit!

36:39.747 --> 36:40.881
Copy.

36:43.284 --> 36:44.818
Get those ships in the air!

36:44.885 --> 36:46.519
Launch! Launch!

36:46.586 --> 36:47.788
The channel's dead.

36:50.256 --> 36:51.559
All right, we gotta get there
before another eruption!

36:51.624 --> 36:53.760
Launch! Launch!
Break formation!

36:53.827 --> 36:55.428
Go for launch!
Go for launch!

36:59.298 --> 37:01.133
Fleet, damage report.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.302
We've lost 22 ships, Captain.

37:02.369 --> 37:04.171
We're the only craft remaining.

37:04.238 --> 37:06.106
They're gone!

37:06.173 --> 37:07.640
Matthews and Hayes made it out.

37:07.707 --> 37:09.476
They can't complete the mission.

37:09.541 --> 37:12.044
Where's the AI craft?

37:12.111 --> 37:13.380
What? The one untested?

37:13.447 --> 37:15.082
The experimental craft!
Where is it?

37:15.148 --> 37:16.150
Hangar 13!

37:20.452 --> 37:21.553
We're going in.

37:21.621 --> 37:23.189
What? To the cargo hold?

37:23.256 --> 37:24.291
Hang on!

37:24.358 --> 37:25.392
You can't drive into the ship!

37:25.459 --> 37:26.426
Here we go!

37:26.492 --> 37:27.960
Stop! Stop!

37:46.213 --> 37:48.048
We gotta go!
We gotta go!

37:55.956 --> 37:57.490
<i>Hello, Jim and Paul Lawson.</i>

37:57.557 --> 37:59.059
<i>Preflight protocol
is initiated.</i>

37:59.126 --> 38:01.195
<i>Jim, I see you are
the pilot today.</i>

38:04.231 --> 38:06.599
Go for launch!

38:06.666 --> 38:09.035
<i>Manual flight engaged.</i>

38:09.102 --> 38:10.604
Launch now!

38:10.671 --> 38:12.306
<i>Protocol discourages
launching from inside...</i>

38:12.372 --> 38:13.506
Launch now!

38:13.573 --> 38:15.508
X.C., scan for imminent threats!

38:15.575 --> 38:16.976
<i>Imminent threat detected.</i>

38:17.043 --> 38:21.948
<i>Launch at t-minus
three, two, one.</i>

38:29.756 --> 38:31.858
- We got at least another mile.
- Okay.

38:31.925 --> 38:36.129
So what brought you
to Camp Pendleton?

38:36.195 --> 38:37.197
I was...

38:38.666 --> 38:43.637
I started dating this guy,
a good guy, a Marine.

38:43.704 --> 38:45.606
He had just started
his patrol on the base

38:45.673 --> 38:46.874
when the earthquake struck.

38:48.675 --> 38:50.910
Well, if everything goes
according to plan,

38:50.977 --> 38:53.581
we'll get you reunited with him.

38:55.115 --> 38:56.116
With who?

38:58.418 --> 38:59.519
The Marine.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.796
What's our ETA to impact?

39:13.300 --> 39:14.734
Hey, Paul?

39:14.800 --> 39:17.170
Paul, focus on my voice, huh?
Deep breaths.

39:17.236 --> 39:19.072
What's the ETA to impact?

39:20.740 --> 39:22.608
43 minutes.

39:22.675 --> 39:24.510
How far is the moon
from the earth?

39:24.577 --> 39:27.613
NASA and the DOD's
database is down.

39:27.680 --> 39:29.749
Hauser said the Colossus
satellite is disabled.

39:29.816 --> 39:31.217
I'm not getting any updates.

39:31.285 --> 39:32.820
All right...

39:32.885 --> 39:35.387
X.C., how far is the moon
from our current position?

39:35.454 --> 39:38.791
<i>Calculating... there is no
GPS data available.</i>

39:38.858 --> 39:40.427
<i>Communication satellite
shows fatal error.</i>

39:40.494 --> 39:42.095
<i>Enabling laser distancing:</i>

39:42.162 --> 39:44.197
<i>I detect a major disruption
of the Moon's orbit.</i>

39:44.264 --> 39:45.698
<i>Current distance
from our location:</i>

39:45.765 --> 39:48.068
<i>163,209 miles.</i>

39:48.133 --> 39:50.669
All right, so the moon's
a third of the way here.

39:50.736 --> 39:52.171
We don't have an escort.

39:53.673 --> 39:55.242
<i>Jim, we are
receiving an alert.</i>

39:55.309 --> 39:56.709
<i>Two XVision spacecraft are
approaching rapidly.</i>

40:02.014 --> 40:03.282
Sir?

40:03.349 --> 40:05.885
We are guarding you the rest
of the way to the drone.

40:05.952 --> 40:08.755
Thank you, Captain.
We owe you one.

40:08.822 --> 40:10.756
Tell me, what's
your payload today?

40:10.823 --> 40:11.959
We have
two stinger missiles each,

40:12.026 --> 40:13.627
plus the two on your craft.

40:13.693 --> 40:16.329
I am first point,
Lieutenant Matthews is second,

40:16.396 --> 40:17.664
your craft is last.

40:19.532 --> 40:23.336
Don't tell me Excalibur's never
fired its weapon system before.

40:23.403 --> 40:26.238
You want me to lie to you?

40:26.305 --> 40:29.242
<i>Extremely hazardous conditions
detected in the troposphere.</i>

40:29.309 --> 40:31.577
<i>Incoming meteors and
disabled satellites detected.</i>

40:31.644 --> 40:33.213
<i>All ground contact is severed.</i>

40:33.278 --> 40:35.180
<i>Advise safe landing
immediately.</i>

40:35.247 --> 40:37.083
X.C., shut up.

40:37.151 --> 40:38.252
Incoming! 10:00!

40:41.555 --> 40:43.657
It's maneuvering in the opposite
direction I want it to go!

40:43.724 --> 40:45.225
It's following its program.

40:45.291 --> 40:46.293
Well, turn it off!

40:46.360 --> 40:47.294
I can't!
It's reacting...

40:47.360 --> 40:48.528
Turn it off!

40:48.595 --> 40:50.063
X. C., quiet mode!
Manual function!

40:50.130 --> 40:51.999
<i>Going quiet.
Manual function.</i>

40:52.064 --> 40:53.200
Thank you.

40:55.367 --> 40:56.369
Incoming dead ahead!

41:00.573 --> 41:02.242
Incoming!

41:02.309 --> 41:03.543
Matthews!

41:07.847 --> 41:09.283
Sir, stay your course!

41:10.383 --> 41:11.752
Staying the course.

41:11.818 --> 41:13.419
We're almost out
of the mesosphere.

41:13.485 --> 41:16.022
Be in orbit in 30 seconds.

41:16.088 --> 41:18.525
Uh... Jim?

41:18.592 --> 41:19.860
Incoming!

41:20.660 --> 41:22.029
Fox One.

41:26.532 --> 41:27.735
It's still coming!

41:37.510 --> 41:39.244
<i>Jim! What do we do?</i>

41:39.311 --> 41:40.813
<i>Jim!</i>

41:44.416 --> 41:46.352
- Hayes!
- No!

41:49.256 --> 41:50.424
We lost them.

42:10.843 --> 42:12.111
It's quiet.

42:13.813 --> 42:15.182
Yeah, well...

42:16.849 --> 42:18.550
We're in the middle
of the detonation zone

42:18.617 --> 42:20.186
from the missile strike.

42:20.253 --> 42:22.722
We're only gonna get
about a minute of this.

42:28.427 --> 42:30.529
You all right?

42:30.597 --> 42:32.365
Yeah.

42:32.432 --> 42:34.767
I'm just not really used to
the physical impact of it.

42:36.803 --> 42:39.572
Well, we were pulling about
five Gs there,

42:39.639 --> 42:40.907
so I don't blame you.

42:43.610 --> 42:45.044
Yeah.

42:47.581 --> 42:50.783
I hear this ship has
a cyclotron gyroscope

42:50.849 --> 42:52.785
ballast here.

42:54.854 --> 42:56.990
You don't know what that is?

42:57.055 --> 42:58.958
It's artificial gravity.

43:01.561 --> 43:03.764
Wow!

43:03.831 --> 43:06.399
Wow, this is what you
feel all day?

43:06.465 --> 43:08.400
This is awesome!

43:08.468 --> 43:09.902
I like this.

43:09.968 --> 43:12.037
Try it on for size.

43:12.104 --> 43:14.706
All right, focus up.
We need to find that drone.

43:16.575 --> 43:20.713
X.C., find the distress signal
on our drone.

43:20.780 --> 43:22.215
<i>X.C. is back online.</i>

43:22.282 --> 43:24.918
<i>Hello, Jim and Paul.
Locating drone.</i>

43:24.983 --> 43:29.655
Now Excalibur
can navigate us

43:29.722 --> 43:31.925
straight to the drone.

43:31.992 --> 43:33.526
I thought you
said it wasn't tested.

43:33.593 --> 43:35.662
Yeah, it's untested,
but it has autopilot.

43:35.727 --> 43:37.363
You know what that is.

43:37.430 --> 43:39.999
Look, an AI component is a lot
different than an autopilot.

43:40.066 --> 43:43.370
Yeah, I get that, but
this one's one of a kind.

43:43.436 --> 43:45.004
You know, it's got
the robotic arm,

43:45.070 --> 43:47.874
laser guidance system,
smart controls.

43:47.941 --> 43:49.676
It'll save you from
doing a little moon walk

43:49.742 --> 43:52.344
to get the antimatter engine.

43:52.412 --> 43:54.948
Look, you were there
before we wanted to take off.

43:55.014 --> 43:56.515
The ship wanted to delay
until we had to tell it

43:56.582 --> 43:58.284
there was a threat.

43:58.351 --> 44:01.889
Paul, look, human instinct
still has to be the baseline.

44:03.423 --> 44:05.058
Okay, bro.

44:10.764 --> 44:12.800
Diaz, the Damage
Response team

44:12.865 --> 44:15.168
needs to reactivate
that satellite ASAP!

44:15.235 --> 44:18.005
Run a fine-point signal to
capture any onboard functions.

44:18.070 --> 44:20.339
We have no communication
with Lawson or the drone.

44:20.405 --> 44:23.008
Their last alert was
10 minutes ago, correct?

44:23.075 --> 44:24.943
These are distress signals.

44:25.010 --> 44:27.213
The base was
completely destroyed.

44:27.280 --> 44:29.349
Do we have confirmation of that?

44:29.414 --> 44:31.884
Ma'am, some of the
distress signals

44:31.952 --> 44:34.988
and security footage reached
our feed before it went black.

44:35.055 --> 44:37.357
There's nothing left of it.

44:37.423 --> 44:39.159
Looks like there was
some kind of explosion

44:39.226 --> 44:41.494
that leveled at
a five-square mile radius.

44:41.561 --> 44:43.095
What about our Air Force?

44:43.162 --> 44:45.363
Are there any bases capable
of launching aircraft?

44:45.430 --> 44:48.300
Ma'am, the communication
database feed

44:48.367 --> 44:51.671
shows heavy damage
and destruction.

44:51.738 --> 44:53.940
All of our assets
are inoperable.

44:54.006 --> 44:55.876
Half of them went down
in the ocean

44:55.943 --> 44:57.744
during the disruption
of the poles.

44:57.811 --> 45:00.213
The loss of life is enormous.

45:07.787 --> 45:09.956
This craft looks familiar.

45:10.023 --> 45:12.858
Yep. It ought to.

45:12.925 --> 45:14.326
You designed it.

45:14.394 --> 45:16.162
Really? So you just...
so you took my design?

45:16.229 --> 45:20.267
No, I didn't take
your design, Jim.

45:20.334 --> 45:23.703
I made the Defense Department
make sure that all the parts

45:23.769 --> 45:26.038
and designs go under your LLC.

45:26.106 --> 45:30.575
So anything they use,
you get paid for.

45:30.642 --> 45:33.546
That was my way of trying
to make things right.

45:35.715 --> 45:37.950
I love that picture
you got from George.

45:39.186 --> 45:40.620
The one of us with
Mom at the beach?

45:40.686 --> 45:42.488
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:42.555 --> 45:44.658
Dad must have lost that
when he worked for George

45:44.724 --> 45:46.491
before he went in the Air Force.

45:46.559 --> 45:47.995
Man, he was so mad.

45:48.061 --> 45:50.063
He'd loved that picture.
It was his favorite.

45:51.863 --> 45:53.300
I barely remember it.

45:53.367 --> 45:55.102
Oh, you were only
about five years old.

45:59.206 --> 46:02.242
All I can remember is him
laughing at something you said.

46:02.307 --> 46:03.610
And then I tried
to say something.

46:03.677 --> 46:06.979
And he... He just patted
me on the head.

46:14.121 --> 46:16.923
Look, um...

46:16.990 --> 46:19.026
It wasn't entirely your fault.

46:20.793 --> 46:22.361
What wasn't?

46:22.427 --> 46:24.396
Firing me.

46:24.463 --> 46:27.267
Several years ago when you
were still in high school,

46:27.334 --> 46:29.870
you hadn't even
started XVision yet,

46:29.936 --> 46:32.972
I disobeyed a direct order
on my first lunar mission.

46:35.242 --> 46:37.043
I was ordered back
to the lander,

46:37.110 --> 46:39.246
but instead I went to recover
this metal sample

46:39.313 --> 46:42.381
that we'd lost
when our rover failed.

46:42.447 --> 46:44.249
I should have
gotten a reprimand,

46:44.316 --> 46:46.320
but instead they said
I saved the mission.

46:48.722 --> 46:52.993
I kind of developed a reputation
for doing stuff like that.

46:58.131 --> 46:59.533
I didn't know that.

46:59.599 --> 47:03.537
Yeah, well, everyone in
the Air Force loved Dad.

47:03.602 --> 47:06.106
So they kind of loved
me by association.

47:08.340 --> 47:12.311
I mean, the reports, they should
have said I was "reckless".

47:12.378 --> 47:14.981
But they said
I was "quick thinking".

47:16.883 --> 47:20.387
And then when I lost control
during last year's mission...

47:22.088 --> 47:26.426
my reputation
went right out the window.

47:26.492 --> 47:30.029
I mean, it didn't matter that
it was a gravitational anomaly

47:30.095 --> 47:35.066
from 100 million miles out that
forced my craft into the moon.

47:35.133 --> 47:37.137
It didn't matter.

47:37.204 --> 47:40.140
I couldn't save my copilot.

47:40.206 --> 47:42.808
No matter how thorough
my report was,

47:42.876 --> 47:44.945
warning everyone about
an asteroid so massive

47:45.010 --> 47:48.313
that it could affect
my spacecraft from that far out

47:48.381 --> 47:50.650
and it was gonna strike the moon
in less than a year...

47:53.052 --> 47:54.254
no one believed me.

47:57.222 --> 47:58.425
Not even you.

48:08.535 --> 48:10.570
What happened last year
wasn't your fault.

48:12.037 --> 48:13.505
It wasn't your fault
at all, actually.

48:13.572 --> 48:14.573
It was mine.

48:15.675 --> 48:17.276
I was the one that
you discharged.

48:17.343 --> 48:19.379
I was the one that
threw you under the bus.

48:24.249 --> 48:26.619
Jim, your copilot's death
wasn't your fault.

48:29.555 --> 48:32.891
None of this is.
It's mine.

48:32.959 --> 48:34.461
But it could have been my fault.

48:34.528 --> 48:36.396
That's why it's
not unreasonable for you

48:36.461 --> 48:39.666
to strip me of my career
in order to save XVision.

48:43.635 --> 48:47.073
Just like it wasn't unreasonable
for Stacey to leave me.

48:56.282 --> 48:58.517
That's the dumbest
thing you've ever said.

49:00.452 --> 49:02.454
If that's true, then why did
Dad have you drive him

49:02.521 --> 49:05.358
to the hospital every single
day for his treatments?

49:05.425 --> 49:09.028
Not once did he ask me.
You know why?

49:09.095 --> 49:12.798
Because you're accountable.

49:12.865 --> 49:15.702
You're accountable.

49:15.769 --> 49:18.271
No cancellations,
nothing ever came up.

49:19.771 --> 49:20.806
You were always there.

49:22.541 --> 49:23.809
And me...

49:28.881 --> 49:30.517
I'm selfish.

49:31.383 --> 49:33.552
Always trying to
prove something.

49:40.059 --> 49:41.294
You said Stacey's safe?

49:43.863 --> 49:44.865
Yeah.

49:46.131 --> 49:47.566
Yeah, Stacey's safe.

49:51.838 --> 49:52.839
Good.

49:55.140 --> 49:58.477
X.C., activate navigation.

49:58.544 --> 50:00.947
Direct it towards
that distress signal.

50:01.014 --> 50:02.448
<i>Navigation engaged.</i>

50:02.514 --> 50:04.917
<i>Distance to drone: 5,300 miles.</i>

50:04.985 --> 50:07.119
<i>Current speed: nearing MACH 20.</i>

50:07.186 --> 50:09.588
<i>15,208 miles per hour.</i>

50:09.655 --> 50:13.459
<i>Homing beacon interface

50:24.269 --> 50:25.538
Malcolm...

50:26.771 --> 50:27.773
Malcolm?

50:27.840 --> 50:29.775
Ah... oh.

50:29.842 --> 50:32.678
Malcolm?

50:41.019 --> 50:45.992
Communications dish in D.C.
might not have enough power

50:46.057 --> 50:48.394
to get their message
through to our astronauts.

50:50.829 --> 50:54.534
To get to the Comm 4, it's at
the top of the next ridge.

50:56.936 --> 51:00.740
Plug the chip in that case

51:00.805 --> 51:03.909
into the port inside
the box on the building.

51:05.878 --> 51:07.646
Malcolm? Malcolm?

51:07.713 --> 51:09.248
Hey...

51:12.251 --> 51:13.986
Malcolm.

51:14.052 --> 51:15.354
No.

51:16.588 --> 51:18.189
No!

51:18.256 --> 51:19.858
Wake up!

51:22.160 --> 51:24.831
I'm so sorry.

51:32.338 --> 51:34.474
I'm sorry, Malcolm.

51:37.075 --> 51:38.744
Ow!

51:45.217 --> 51:47.485
<i>Laser distancing detects

51:47.552 --> 51:48.920
<i>to the Moon's orbit.</i>

All right, all right.

52:11.376 --> 52:13.045

52:13.113 --> 52:14.314
35 minutes.

52:15.481 --> 52:17.049
<i>Incoming!
Two meteors approaching!</i>

52:17.115 --> 52:19.451
<i>First is upper left,
second is lower right.</i>

52:19.517 --> 52:20.686
<i>Evasive maneuvers!</i>

52:20.753 --> 52:21.888
Hang on.

52:29.928 --> 52:31.597
How fast can X.C. go?

52:31.664 --> 52:33.299
MACH 30.

52:33.365 --> 52:34.967
X.C., go to MACH 30!

52:35.034 --> 52:36.869
<i>Captain Lawson, given
the intensity</i>

52:36.936 --> 52:38.504
<i>of the current meteor shower,
I cannot recommend...</i>

52:38.570 --> 52:40.005
X.C., the moon will crash
into the earth

52:40.072 --> 52:41.506
if we don't reach that drone.

52:41.573 --> 52:44.242
<i>Calibrating.
This is an unprecedented event.</i>

52:44.309 --> 52:46.144
<i>Risk assessment: both courses
of action will lead</i>

52:46.211 --> 52:48.480
<i>to the destruction
of the spacecraft.</i>

52:48.548 --> 52:50.550
X.C., go at maximum speed now!

52:50.615 --> 52:52.318
<i>Increasing to maximum speed.</i>

52:52.385 --> 52:54.119
<i>I am unable to advise further.</i>

52:54.186 --> 52:55.188
Good luck, Captain Lawson.

52:55.253 --> 52:56.588
Good luck?

53:31.057 --> 53:34.461
Pentagon, this is
Comm Four Southwest.

53:39.298 --> 53:41.867
Pentagon, do you read?

53:41.934 --> 53:43.535
Comm Four, this is
Colonel Hauser.

53:43.602 --> 53:45.003
Do you have additional
bandwidth to redirect

53:45.070 --> 53:46.739
the Colossus disc?

53:46.805 --> 53:49.275
It's your last chance to
get that signal through.

53:49.342 --> 53:51.110
Yes, ma'am.

53:51.177 --> 53:52.611
Okay.

54:04.523 --> 54:06.525
Okay, signal should be working.

54:08.327 --> 54:09.795
Comm Four, we see no signal.

54:09.863 --> 54:11.597
We're failing to
reach maximum capacity.

54:11.664 --> 54:14.534
Uh, stand by.

54:55.974 --> 54:57.709
Okay.

55:03.749 --> 55:05.551
Okay, you should
have signal now.

55:05.617 --> 55:07.853
Copy, Comm Four.
Transmission is live.

55:13.526 --> 55:15.227
Ma'am, radar is picking
up an object

55:15.293 --> 55:18.397
heading past the mesosphere
and into the debris field.

55:18.463 --> 55:20.431
Is it a rogue missile?

55:20.499 --> 55:23.169
No, ma'am.
It's a spacecraft.

55:23.235 --> 55:24.871
That has to be Lawson.

55:24.938 --> 55:27.872
Ma'am, our fine-point
signal has regained

55:27.939 --> 55:29.809
contact with
the antimatter drive.

55:29.874 --> 55:32.010
Try to make contact
with the spacecraft.

55:32.077 --> 55:33.778
There's too much
interference, ma'am.

55:33.845 --> 55:36.682
Amplify the signal to catch
any onboard functions.

55:36.749 --> 55:38.117
We can build a
vectoring model

55:38.184 --> 55:39.885
to send to Lawson in case
he loses the drone.

55:39.952 --> 55:41.787
The Colossus can't sustain
the same stress levels

55:41.854 --> 55:43.522
after its repairs, ma'am.

55:43.588 --> 55:46.159
We have to get through to him
even just for a status update!

55:46.226 --> 55:48.928
Ma'am, radar is picking up
a signal off the Chinese coast.

55:48.994 --> 55:50.461
They sent out a global alert.

55:50.528 --> 55:52.030
They've launched
their nuclear weapons.

55:52.097 --> 55:54.467
We need to warn him
that a nuclear strike

55:54.534 --> 55:56.669
in his vicinity is imminent.

55:56.735 --> 55:59.804
Lieutenant, amplify
the signal to the dish

55:59.872 --> 56:02.308
even if it risks destroying it.

56:02.374 --> 56:04.010
Yes, ma'am.

56:06.912 --> 56:08.414
X.C., prepare the robotic arm.

56:08.481 --> 56:10.549
<i>Running diagnostics
on the robotic arm.</i>

56:10.615 --> 56:12.985
<i>All functions are optimal.</i>

56:13.952 --> 56:16.256
<i>Lawson!
Colonel Hauser.</i>

56:16.322 --> 56:18.791
Are we actually getting
a signal from somewhere?

56:18.858 --> 56:20.325
There's only a handful
of sites on earth

56:20.392 --> 56:22.095
that have that type
of power of communication, so...

56:22.160 --> 56:25.329
it's either the Pentagon
or some other G8 country.

56:25.396 --> 56:26.331
See if I can get it.

56:30.535 --> 56:32.604
Go for Jim Lawson.

56:35.374 --> 56:37.644
Can't get it.

56:37.709 --> 56:39.345
Ma'am, the missiles
from China are approaching

56:39.410 --> 56:40.445
the upper atmosphere.

56:40.512 --> 56:41.880
What's their time to impact?

56:41.947 --> 56:43.816
Three minutes, 50 seconds.

56:43.883 --> 56:46.519
Ma'am, we've rerouted additional
power sources to the Dish.

56:46.586 --> 56:47.953
But it won't
hold up much longer.

56:48.019 --> 56:49.354
I've got error
messages popping up

56:49.421 --> 56:50.956
from the main control switches.

56:51.023 --> 56:53.992
Are the electrical engineers
still at the mainframe?

56:54.059 --> 56:55.360
Yes, ma'am.

56:55.427 --> 56:57.262
Have them regulate the power
fluctuations manually.

56:57.329 --> 56:58.730
Turn off the smaller systems.

56:58.798 --> 57:01.200
Just keep the main circuit
from melting down.

57:01.267 --> 57:03.102
Yes, ma'am.

57:03.168 --> 57:05.703
We're about 8,000 yards
out now from the drone.

57:05.771 --> 57:07.307
We should have a visual.

57:10.977 --> 57:11.910
Lawson...

57:16.314 --> 57:18.217
Go for Jim Lawson.

57:19.517 --> 57:22.088
Did not stop...
Repeat, did not...

57:22.155 --> 57:24.990
Oh, she's warning us
about something here.

57:25.057 --> 57:26.792
X.C., can you break though the
static on the incoming message?

57:26.858 --> 57:30.328
<i>Clearing radio signal.</i>

57:30.396 --> 57:32.932
<i>Paul, I apologize but I cannot
clear the incoming message.</i>

57:32.999 --> 57:35.568
<i>Only discernible words are
"Repeat" and "Did not".</i>

57:35.635 --> 57:37.535
All right.
Keep monitoring the radio.

57:37.602 --> 57:38.905
We're almost to the drone.

57:38.972 --> 57:41.372
X.C., move the robotic
arm to port side.

57:41.439 --> 57:44.008
<i>Repositioning arm to port.</i>

57:44.075 --> 57:46.278
X.C., can you tell how
much battery power is left

57:46.345 --> 57:48.147
in the antimatter engine?

57:48.213 --> 57:50.383
<i>Battery reserve on
the antimatter drive...</i>

57:50.448 --> 57:52.851
<i>calculating 40%.</i>

57:52.918 --> 57:55.121
That battery's running out fast.

57:55.188 --> 57:56.988
If it encounters a
problem in orbit,

57:57.055 --> 57:58.957
it's programmed to send
the highest possible signal

57:59.025 --> 58:00.760
and make sure it reaches earth.

58:00.825 --> 58:02.861
Burns a lot of juice.

58:06.064 --> 58:08.034
Ma'am, the nuclear missiles
are exiting the atmosphere.

58:08.867 --> 58:10.401
Lawson, this is Hauser.

58:10.468 --> 58:11.970
Come in, Lawson! Lawson!

58:15.173 --> 58:19.445
X.C., extend the arm,
full extension.

58:19.512 --> 58:22.481
<i>Yes, Captain. Extending robot
arm to maximum extension.</i>

58:22.548 --> 58:24.183
Reverse thrust 12%.

58:25.383 --> 58:26.651
<i>Reverse thrust 12%.</i>

58:26.718 --> 58:31.456
<i>Acceleration at... 88%...76%.</i>

58:31.523 --> 58:33.392
<i>Target within 1,000 yards.</i>

58:42.233 --> 58:44.336
X.C., assume control
of the craft.

58:44.403 --> 58:46.103
Bring us into
a stabilized position

58:46.171 --> 58:47.873
on the port side
of the stalled drone.

58:47.939 --> 58:49.775
<i>Initiating guidance system</i>

58:49.842 --> 58:51.876
<i>and assuming control
of the spacecraft.</i>

58:51.943 --> 58:53.978
All right, X.C.,
use the robotic arm

58:54.046 --> 58:56.381
to remove the antimatter drive.

58:56.447 --> 58:59.117
<i>Are there any fine motor
fixtures which will require</i>

58:59.184 --> 59:01.420
<i>use of the arm's toolkit?</i>

59:01.486 --> 59:04.055
X.C., there are 16 bolts
and a breakaway shield.

59:04.122 --> 59:06.159
Make sure they're all removed.

59:07.693 --> 59:09.262
Yeah, I know a thing or two.

59:20.439 --> 59:22.207
<i>Captain Lawson, now that
the bolts have been removed,</i>

59:22.273 --> 59:24.342
<i>I will need to use the arm's
welding torch</i>

59:24.410 --> 59:26.178
<i>to unseal the welded joints
on the engine's heat shield.</i>

59:26.244 --> 59:27.678
No, we can't risk
a welder damaging the engine

59:27.746 --> 59:29.148
under the shield.

59:30.215 --> 59:32.418
The drone's
too large to fit inside.

59:32.483 --> 59:35.020
I may have to go out
and recover it manually.

59:35.086 --> 59:36.988
- Let's suit up.
- Let's do it.

59:40.025 --> 59:42.794
X.C., prepare for space walk.
Open cargo bay doors.

59:42.861 --> 59:44.597
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

59:44.664 --> 59:45.831
<i>Air containment in progress
and opening cargo bay doors.</i>

59:45.898 --> 59:46.865
- Good to go?
- Yeah.

59:46.932 --> 59:48.400
What do you need me to do?

59:48.467 --> 59:50.535
Well, when I tell the AI
to bring me back on the arm,

59:50.602 --> 59:51.804
you monitor the controls.

59:51.869 --> 59:52.871
Make sure it listens.

59:52.938 --> 59:54.372
Copy that.

01:00:00.244 --> 01:00:01.813
ETA?

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.816
<i>We got 26 minutes!</i>

01:00:17.396 --> 01:00:19.365
<i>Incoming! Nuclear missiles are
approaching the debris field!</i>

01:00:19.432 --> 01:00:21.967
<i>Warning! Detonation within
the debris field is imminent!</i>

01:00:22.034 --> 01:00:23.468
Jim, we got a nuclear strike!

01:00:23.535 --> 01:00:24.670
Don't touch anything!

01:00:24.736 --> 01:00:26.439
Stand by!

01:00:26.506 --> 01:00:28.441
<i>Nuclear missiles are
approaching the debris field!</i>

01:00:28.506 --> 01:00:29.740
<i>Jim, emergency
procedure requires</i>

01:00:29.807 --> 01:00:30.809
<i>that astronauts outside...</i>

01:00:30.876 --> 01:00:33.177
Disregard emergency procedures!

01:00:33.244 --> 01:00:35.080
X.C., do not listen
to that order!

01:00:35.146 --> 01:00:37.048
I am bringing Jim inside!

01:00:37.115 --> 01:00:40.052
<i>Paul, I see you've engaged the
manual functions on the tether.</i>

01:00:40.117 --> 01:00:42.755
<i>Jim, get your butt
back in here now!</i>

01:00:42.822 --> 01:00:44.856
Don't bring me in!

01:00:46.124 --> 01:00:48.059
I've almost got it!

01:00:48.126 --> 01:00:50.563
I don't give a shit, Jim!
Get back in here now!

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:53.631
<i>Detonation in seven, six, five,</i>

01:00:53.698 --> 01:00:58.202
<i>four, three, two, one...</i>

01:00:58.269 --> 01:00:59.472
Jim!

01:01:03.675 --> 01:01:05.343
- Oh!
- Oh.

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:07.280
Closing cargo bay.

01:01:11.983 --> 01:01:13.451
<i>Severe damage reported.</i>

01:01:13.517 --> 01:01:15.454
- <i>Fuel line has been breached.</i>
- Go, go, go, go!

01:01:15.519 --> 01:01:16.921
<i>Fuel is leaking from
the exterior</i>

01:01:16.988 --> 01:01:18.590
<i>and interior of
the spacecraft.</i>

01:01:18.657 --> 01:01:20.892
We need to shut off the fuel
before anything ignites it.

01:01:20.959 --> 01:01:22.495
- <i>Fuel remaining: 78%.</i>
- It's no use.

01:01:22.561 --> 01:01:24.162
All controls for the control
panel has been severed.

01:01:24.229 --> 01:01:25.897
All right. We'll have to shut
down the engines.

01:01:25.963 --> 01:01:27.799
- Shut down the engines?
- <i>65%.</i>

01:01:27.867 --> 01:01:29.368
Any electronic onboard
can ignite it!

01:01:29.434 --> 01:01:31.703
I mean, we'd have to shut down
this entire ship!

01:01:31.769 --> 01:01:33.104
Well, that's what
we're gonna do.

01:01:33.171 --> 01:01:35.874
Maybe you forgot
we just lost the drone.

01:01:35.941 --> 01:01:37.576
I mean, we'd be floating
dead in space, Jim!

01:01:37.642 --> 01:01:39.711
Look, we don't have a choice!

01:01:39.778 --> 01:01:41.313
If that explodes, we die

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.048
and every chance of saving
the earth goes with us.

01:01:45.117 --> 01:01:46.818
X.C., cease all
onboard functions.

01:01:46.885 --> 01:01:48.521
Power down the ship.

01:01:48.586 --> 01:01:50.555
<i>Captain, the craft is currently
spinning out of control.</i>

01:01:50.622 --> 01:01:53.457
Cease all engine and
onboard functions now.

01:01:53.525 --> 01:01:54.994
Shut down the ship.

01:01:55.061 --> 01:01:57.329
<i>Ceasing all engine and
onboard functions.</i>

01:01:59.731 --> 01:02:01.400
You better be right.

01:02:01.467 --> 01:02:05.637
We need an alternate means of
propulsion to reach the drone.

01:02:05.704 --> 01:02:09.108
We can use the ship's
air evacuator valves.

01:02:09.173 --> 01:02:11.643
What? So we use the onboard
air as propellant?

01:02:11.709 --> 01:02:14.313
Exactly.
Come on.

01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:19.885
We've lost them, ma'am.

01:02:19.952 --> 01:02:21.453
No, not necessarily.

01:02:21.519 --> 01:02:23.755
We lost their onboard stream
to our Cloud database.

01:02:23.822 --> 01:02:25.356
Check the radar.

01:02:25.423 --> 01:02:27.759
We still have a radar
reading on Excalibur, ma'am.

01:02:27.825 --> 01:02:30.996
It looks like the majority of
their superstructure is intact.

01:02:31.063 --> 01:02:33.331
Do we have any communication?

01:02:33.398 --> 01:02:35.199
The systems are down, ma'am,

01:02:35.267 --> 01:02:37.903
and thermal imaging suggests
that their engines are off, too.

01:02:43.575 --> 01:02:47.111
Ma'am, the structures
above us have collapsed.

01:02:47.178 --> 01:02:48.579
Call engineering.

01:02:48.646 --> 01:02:51.750
Have them devise a brace
for the structure.

01:02:51.816 --> 01:02:53.918
Level Nine to engineers?
Code Grey!

01:02:53.985 --> 01:02:56.020
The floor above us
is starting to collapse.

01:02:56.088 --> 01:02:57.756
I repeat, Code Grey!

01:02:57.822 --> 01:02:59.190
If Lawson's systems are offline,

01:02:59.256 --> 01:03:00.592
he may need us to guide him
to the drone

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:02.194
using our radar coordinates.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:05.530
Level Nine engineers?
Come in, Level Nine engineers.

01:03:05.597 --> 01:03:07.533
Ma'am, the engineers
aren't responding!

01:03:07.599 --> 01:03:09.367
Try to find them on
the server's location grid.

01:03:09.434 --> 01:03:11.503
What are the orbital
coordinates of the drone?

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:14.407
29.09 north, 71.17 east,

01:03:14.472 --> 01:03:19.945
209 million 200 miles
per hour at 94 degrees.

01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:21.512
Threat Response team!

01:03:21.579 --> 01:03:24.882
Give a full electrical surge
to the Dish's mainframe.

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:30.723
And Morse Code the following
coordinates, 29.09 north.

01:03:32.291 --> 01:03:34.093
Look, I have a visual
on the drone.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.160
But there's no accurate way
to judge distance

01:03:35.227 --> 01:03:36.595
or coordinates, Jim.

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:38.796
Now what's the ETA
to atmospheric impact?

01:03:38.863 --> 01:03:40.599
18 minutes.

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:42.934
All right, look,
we got four ducts

01:03:43.001 --> 01:03:44.669
to evacuate air from the ship.

01:03:44.736 --> 01:03:47.372
We got two here in the cockpit,
two back in the cargo hold.

01:03:47.439 --> 01:03:50.042
But we're going to need the
exact location of the drone.

01:03:52.311 --> 01:03:54.380
Is that Morse Code?

01:03:54.447 --> 01:03:56.448
Well, it has to be the Pentagon!

01:03:56.514 --> 01:03:57.248
It's a number.

01:03:57.316 --> 01:03:59.352
It said 29.09 north.

01:03:59.418 --> 01:04:01.354
Wait. That doesn't match our
coordinates.

01:04:01.419 --> 01:04:04.655
That's 12,000 miles
from our starting point.

01:04:04.722 --> 01:04:06.757
They're giving us the
coordinates for the drone.

01:04:06.825 --> 01:04:09.028
Yeah, but we've lost access
to the ship's coordinates, Jim.

01:04:09.093 --> 01:04:11.329
So we have no way
of tracking it.

01:04:11.396 --> 01:04:13.031
The compass, the compass!

01:04:13.097 --> 01:04:15.099
Compass?
What compass?

01:04:15.166 --> 01:04:17.168
Jim, what compass?

01:04:18.769 --> 01:04:21.373
Come on, come on, XC.

01:04:28.247 --> 01:04:30.950
All right, look.

01:04:31.017 --> 01:04:32.484
This is an old
World War II compass.

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:34.218
The needle's painted
with radium 66.

01:04:34.285 --> 01:04:35.486
That's radioactive.

01:04:35.553 --> 01:04:37.822
The engine has a
proton cyclotron booster

01:04:37.889 --> 01:04:39.356
just like the Hadron Collider.

01:04:39.423 --> 01:04:41.526
Now when that blast went off,

01:04:41.593 --> 01:04:43.629
this was within 40 feet
of that engine.

01:04:43.695 --> 01:04:45.296
So the subatomic particles
were affected?

01:04:45.363 --> 01:04:46.365
Exactly.

01:04:46.432 --> 01:04:48.200
Separated into ions
from the radium.

01:04:48.267 --> 01:04:51.637
So now instead of magnetism
pulling the needle,

01:04:51.704 --> 01:04:55.073
the ions in the dial are
mirroring the ions in the drone.

01:04:55.139 --> 01:04:56.740
So it's overpowering
the magnetic forces?

01:04:56.807 --> 01:04:59.410
Right. And if we could find
a horizontal plane relative

01:04:59.477 --> 01:05:01.746
to the drone's orientation
and relative

01:05:01.814 --> 01:05:03.615
to its vertical orientation,

01:05:03.682 --> 01:05:05.785
we can measure
the angles on the dial,

01:05:05.851 --> 01:05:07.285
triangulate the drone's
current heading

01:05:07.352 --> 01:05:09.154
relative to our position.

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:11.023
Yeah, but what about its speed?

01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:13.525
All right, we can trace our path
using the ship's database.

01:05:13.592 --> 01:05:16.095
From when the nuke hit
us 'til now,

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:17.830
calculating for
distance over time.

01:05:17.896 --> 01:05:19.464
That would work.
That could work.

01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:20.731
Come on.

01:05:20.798 --> 01:05:22.467
Okay, use those dials
to orient the horizontal

01:05:22.534 --> 01:05:24.269
and vertical planes of
the Excalibur's vector map

01:05:24.336 --> 01:05:25.971
based on the direction
of the compass' needle

01:05:26.037 --> 01:05:30.209
relative to the drone.

01:05:30.276 --> 01:05:31.910
Okay, the X and Y axis
are recalibrated.

01:05:31.977 --> 01:05:36.915
XC, calculate a vector path
based on the new X and Y axis.

01:05:36.981 --> 01:05:38.550
<i>Aligning vectors now.</i>

01:05:39.785 --> 01:05:41.086
<i>Vectors now synced.</i>

01:05:41.153 --> 01:05:43.456
Okay, let's get to
the cargo hold.

01:05:46.559 --> 01:05:47.726
What?

01:05:47.791 --> 01:05:49.561
Don't scrape anything.

01:05:52.697 --> 01:05:54.532
All right,
pull at the same time.

01:05:54.599 --> 01:05:56.702
This should bump us into
a clean trajectory.

01:05:56.767 --> 01:05:57.869
Yeah, I got it.

01:05:57.936 --> 01:05:59.003
On three.
Can you count that high?

01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:00.005
Yeah!

01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:01.005
All right, one, two...

01:06:01.072 --> 01:06:02.474
- Three.
- Three.

01:06:07.512 --> 01:06:08.980
All right.
We should be on target now.

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:10.515
Yeah, hopefully.

01:06:13.485 --> 01:06:14.954
All right, we're on course.

01:06:15.019 --> 01:06:16.188
Let's slow our speed as
we approach the drone.

01:06:16.255 --> 01:06:17.722
Okay.

01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:18.922
You ready? We're gonna do this
together on three.

01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:20.092
Yep.

01:06:20.159 --> 01:06:21.226
One, two...

01:06:21.293 --> 01:06:22.727
- Three!
- Three!

01:06:22.793 --> 01:06:24.028
What happened?

01:06:24.095 --> 01:06:26.063
Nothing.
We must be getting out of air.

01:06:26.131 --> 01:06:27.899
All right, again.
One, two...

01:06:27.965 --> 01:06:29.300
- Three!
- Three!

01:06:29.367 --> 01:06:31.202
We're not slowing down, Jim!

01:06:31.269 --> 01:06:32.303
All right. We're gonna have
to try to snag it

01:06:32.369 --> 01:06:33.771
as we pass the drone.

01:06:33.838 --> 01:06:35.173
Put on your helmet.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.641
What?

01:06:41.113 --> 01:06:42.481
Ma'am, look!

01:06:42.546 --> 01:06:44.382
The Excalibur craft
has changed course!

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:46.117
It's steering towards the drone!

01:06:46.184 --> 01:06:49.421
Is our fine-point signal able
to detect any communications?

01:06:52.323 --> 01:06:53.858
No, ma'am, wait!

01:06:53.925 --> 01:06:55.860
There's a vectoring
update in data Cloud.

01:06:55.927 --> 01:06:58.696
It updated with
two parallel coordinates.

01:06:58.764 --> 01:06:59.932
Good.

01:06:59.999 --> 01:07:01.232
There must be something
onboard their ship

01:07:01.298 --> 01:07:02.834
with an active database.

01:07:04.401 --> 01:07:06.938
Either their spacesuits
or the drone or both.

01:07:09.541 --> 01:07:11.843
Does the arm have a
dedicated power source?

01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:13.111
Yes.

01:07:13.177 --> 01:07:14.246
All right, we have
to turn it on.

01:07:14.313 --> 01:07:16.247
But it could ignite the fuel!

01:07:16.314 --> 01:07:18.116
We have to risk it.

01:07:18.182 --> 01:07:19.885
- Okay.
- Give me a countdown!

01:07:19.952 --> 01:07:21.285
Got it.

01:07:21.352 --> 01:07:24.657
Making contact in 10, 9,

01:07:24.722 --> 01:07:26.457
8, 7, 6...

01:07:26.525 --> 01:07:27.659
Extending the arm.

01:07:27.726 --> 01:07:32.497
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

01:07:34.965 --> 01:07:36.034
- We got it!
- Yes!

01:07:36.101 --> 01:07:37.035
We got it!

01:07:37.102 --> 01:07:38.403
Open the overhead doors!

01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:40.905
What is our ETA
to the moon's impact?

01:07:40.972 --> 01:07:42.674
Six minutes, ma'am.

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:45.543
Ma'am, the ceiling's not
gonna hold much longer

01:07:54.151 --> 01:07:55.553
We have to hurry!

01:07:55.621 --> 01:07:57.356
The moon's close enough
to the atmosphere

01:07:57.421 --> 01:07:59.592
that it's causing "sprite"
electrical charges!

01:08:01.059 --> 01:08:04.395
Jim, the power surges
are activating the ship.

01:08:10.001 --> 01:08:11.336
<i>The connection with
the anti-matter drone</i>

01:08:11.403 --> 01:08:12.838
<i>has been lost.</i>

01:08:12.905 --> 01:08:14.473
- <i>Warning, power surge detected.</i>
- Oh, come on!

01:08:14.539 --> 01:08:15.974
- <i>Power surge detected.</i>
- We just lost the drone!

01:08:16.041 --> 01:08:17.975
We have to shut down
the system before...

01:08:20.879 --> 01:08:23.682
Ma'am, there's been an explosion
onboard the Excalibur!

01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:26.484
The spacecraft is headed
16 degrees, Vector 19

01:08:26.551 --> 01:08:28.886
directly into
the sun's cosmic rays.

01:08:28.953 --> 01:08:30.589
And the drone?

01:08:30.656 --> 01:08:32.857
Do we have updates for the
fine-point reading on the Dish?

01:08:32.924 --> 01:08:36.161
We did capture an active signal
to get it's last heading, ma'am.

01:08:36.227 --> 01:08:39.130
Did you send a vectoring model
to the ship before it exploded?

01:08:39.196 --> 01:08:41.798
I kept updating your
database every second, ma'am.

01:08:41.866 --> 01:08:45.837
Then send a vectoring model
through the Dish, maximum hertz!

01:08:47.104 --> 01:08:48.473
Do we have the engine?

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:50.876
No. It broke free in the arm!

01:08:50.942 --> 01:08:52.210
<i>Fatal error!
Fatal error!</i>

01:08:52.277 --> 01:08:53.578
<i>The hull has been breached!</i>

01:08:53.644 --> 01:08:54.979
<i>Repeat, the hull
has been breached!</i>

01:08:55.045 --> 01:08:56.615
<i>Failure of all
artificial gravity</i>

01:08:56.682 --> 01:08:58.250
<i>and emergency systems
is imminent!</i>

01:08:58.317 --> 01:09:00.319
<i>Catastrophic explosion!</i>

01:09:00.384 --> 01:09:02.520
X.C., where's the antimatter
engine now?

01:09:02.586 --> 01:09:05.089
<i>I am unable to locate
the antimatter drive.</i>

01:09:05.156 --> 01:09:07.390
<i>The drive's distress
signal has stopped.</i>

01:09:07.459 --> 01:09:09.327
<i>Battery power is depleted.</i>

01:09:09.394 --> 01:09:11.361
What's our ETA for the moon?

01:09:11.429 --> 01:09:12.631
- Paul!
- What?

01:09:12.697 --> 01:09:14.698
What's our ETA for the moon?

01:09:14.765 --> 01:09:16.300
Three minutes and 20 seconds.

01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:20.272
<i>Disintegration of the
spacecraft's superstructure</i>

01:09:20.337 --> 01:09:21.673
<i>is imminent.</i>

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.242
<i>Integrity of the spacecraft...</i>

01:09:23.308 --> 01:09:25.743
<i>Warning, disinti...</i>

01:09:25.810 --> 01:09:27.911
The ship's breaking up!
Paul, the ship's breaking up!

01:09:27.978 --> 01:09:30.548
Is there any other
propulsion onboard?

01:09:30.615 --> 01:09:33.151
Paul, get it together!
Is there any other propulsion?

01:09:33.218 --> 01:09:34.920
No, just us.

01:09:34.986 --> 01:09:36.622
That's it.

01:09:38.924 --> 01:09:42.660
I'm gonna get you outta here.
I need you.

01:09:42.727 --> 01:09:43.895
Come on.

01:09:45.863 --> 01:09:47.098
Wait!

01:09:47.165 --> 01:09:50.502
My radio is picking up
a high-frequency pulse.

01:09:50.568 --> 01:09:52.303
There's a waveform reading
in the display.

01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:53.904
It's a sequence.

01:09:53.971 --> 01:09:56.575
It's a vector model, Jim.
The drone's behind us!

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.076
<i>Warning! Disintegration
of the spacecraft</i>

01:09:58.143 --> 01:09:59.244
<i>superstrucutre is imminent!</i>

01:09:59.311 --> 01:10:00.344
<i>Warning! Di...</i>

01:10:00.411 --> 01:10:02.746
Hey, we can't stay on the ship.

01:10:02.813 --> 01:10:05.582
We can use the car
before the gravity dies!

01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:08.318
What, Jim we can't use...

01:10:08.385 --> 01:10:10.455
Zero to 100 in a second, baby.

01:10:10.522 --> 01:10:13.058
Oh, yeah!
Thank you, George!

01:10:15.293 --> 01:10:16.527
Let's get it.

01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:19.564
X.C., open cargo doors!

01:10:22.968 --> 01:10:24.803
Now! Go, go, go!

01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:32.811
Oh!

01:10:32.878 --> 01:10:34.513
Woo hoo hoo!

01:10:37.247 --> 01:10:38.883
Hey, you got a hole!

01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:40.818
Give me your arm!

01:10:43.187 --> 01:10:44.655
What's the time?

01:10:44.723 --> 01:10:46.558
A minute and 58 seconds!

01:10:47.592 --> 01:10:49.326
Here, fix it.

01:10:49.393 --> 01:10:50.861
All right.
It's okay.

01:10:50.929 --> 01:10:54.199
Hey, brother,
look, you trust me?

01:10:54.265 --> 01:10:55.968
Sure!

01:10:59.271 --> 01:11:02.741
Oh!
Whoa!

01:11:05.076 --> 01:11:07.378
What are you doing?

01:11:07.445 --> 01:11:09.148
Paul, what's that light?

01:11:09.214 --> 01:11:11.616
It's ionic particles
being pushed by the sun!

01:11:11.683 --> 01:11:13.051
Our suits can handle it!

01:11:13.117 --> 01:11:14.952
Are you sure?

01:11:15.018 --> 01:11:16.186
I hope so.

01:11:16.254 --> 01:11:17.522
All right, listen.

01:11:17.589 --> 01:11:19.591
We've got the nitrous
in the trunk.

01:11:19.657 --> 01:11:22.160
We can use that to shoot
ourselves toward the drive!

01:11:22.227 --> 01:11:23.362
That's the plan?

01:11:23.428 --> 01:11:24.929
You got a better one?

01:11:24.995 --> 01:11:26.363
No.

01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:28.467
All right, let's get
to the trunk!

01:11:53.758 --> 01:11:57.028
Come on, come on, come on.

01:12:30.195 --> 01:12:31.595
Take these.

01:12:31.662 --> 01:12:33.630
Tape 'em to the side of the car.

01:12:33.697 --> 01:12:36.501
Make sure the nozzles
are pointed backwards.

01:12:37.902 --> 01:12:40.137
1:30,
we need to hurry!

01:13:28.653 --> 01:13:30.254
Okay.

01:13:32.156 --> 01:13:34.359
Now pop that nitrous when
I give the word!

01:13:34.425 --> 01:13:35.494
- You got it?
- Got it!

01:13:35.559 --> 01:13:37.028
All right.

01:13:39.164 --> 01:13:43.300
Three, two, one...

01:13:43.367 --> 01:13:44.969
Pop it!

01:13:53.911 --> 01:13:55.346
All right, here we go.

01:13:55.412 --> 01:13:56.514
It's working!

01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.215
I'm gonna grab the drive.

01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:02.888
You're only gonna get one shot!

01:14:06.057 --> 01:14:08.260
Don't miss it, Jim!
Here it comes!

01:14:10.128 --> 01:14:11.963
Grab it!

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:13.665
Yeah!

01:14:15.098 --> 01:14:17.034
Woo!

01:14:17.102 --> 01:14:18.970
Nice grab, Jumbo!

01:14:27.778 --> 01:14:30.314
The battery's completely dead!

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:31.682
Time to impact?

01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:33.619
Minute and five!

01:14:34.585 --> 01:14:36.153
What's that light?

01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.055
The Moon's reached the
earth's upper ionosphere.

01:14:38.122 --> 01:14:39.790
The atmosphere is
about to catch on fire!

01:14:39.857 --> 01:14:41.259
Take that in the back!

01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:44.662
Hurry up, Paul!

01:14:49.233 --> 01:14:51.202
Jim, what's that?

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:56.674
Paul!

01:14:56.741 --> 01:14:59.344
- Paul!
- Ah!

01:15:02.213 --> 01:15:04.116
Jim!

01:15:23.334 --> 01:15:24.535
Jim!

01:15:24.602 --> 01:15:26.638
I got you, brother!

01:15:26.705 --> 01:15:28.106
Pull me in!

01:15:29.773 --> 01:15:31.910
Pull me in!

01:15:32.744 --> 01:15:34.612
I got you.
Come on, buddy.

01:15:34.679 --> 01:15:36.348
Come on back.

01:15:43.754 --> 01:15:45.322
Where's the tape?

01:15:45.389 --> 01:15:46.892
Got it!

01:15:49.393 --> 01:15:51.862
Hold it still.
I'm gonna tape it down!

01:15:56.134 --> 01:15:58.436
- We're almost out of tape!
- Use it all!

01:15:58.503 --> 01:15:59.470
What are we doing?

01:15:59.537 --> 01:16:01.138
All right, look.

01:16:01.205 --> 01:16:03.275
The drive's battery has leads on
it just like any other battery.

01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:05.409
All it needs is
a current to turn it back on!

01:16:05.476 --> 01:16:08.479
I'll throw the switch,
the engine will start.

01:16:08.545 --> 01:16:10.580
I'll rip the shield off
the side of the battery.

01:16:10.647 --> 01:16:12.616
You can't!
It's screwed on!

01:16:12.683 --> 01:16:14.250
Well, keep pulling!

01:16:14.317 --> 01:16:15.320
Agh!

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:17.554
Come on!

01:16:17.621 --> 01:16:18.956
Tear that thing off!

01:16:19.023 --> 01:16:21.191
We need to get
the cadmium regulator!

01:16:35.473 --> 01:16:38.041
I got it!

01:16:38.108 --> 01:16:40.445
Great, let me
connect the battery.

01:16:58.729 --> 01:17:01.465
Okay, the battery
is connected.

01:17:16.481 --> 01:17:18.081
All right, great!

01:17:18.148 --> 01:17:21.385
Here.
Attach these,

01:17:26.456 --> 01:17:27.758
Just pull, man!

01:17:27.825 --> 01:17:30.028
Can't! It's too short!

01:17:30.094 --> 01:17:31.795
All right. We need something
metal, something...

01:17:31.862 --> 01:17:33.263
We don't have anything metal!

01:17:33.330 --> 01:17:35.432
Something that conducts
electricity.

01:17:35.499 --> 01:17:37.302
Look in the glove box!

01:17:40.071 --> 01:17:42.006
We don't have anything.

01:17:42.072 --> 01:17:43.842
I got it, I got it, I got it!

01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:51.316
Hurry! Hook it up!

01:17:54.117 --> 01:17:57.155
All right, here we go.

01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:59.057
- You ready?
- I'm ready!

01:18:01.726 --> 01:18:03.061
Here we go!

01:18:04.896 --> 01:18:07.566
- It's working!
- It's working!

01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:15.339
All right, go!

01:18:34.625 --> 01:18:37.962
Ma'am, there's been an explosion
on the far side of the moon!

01:18:38.028 --> 01:18:40.531
It's a black hole!

01:18:40.598 --> 01:18:42.733
They did it!

01:18:47.571 --> 01:18:48.973
Phew!

01:18:59.349 --> 01:19:01.486
We're about
to re-enter the atmosphere!

01:19:06.424 --> 01:19:07.626
Paul!

01:19:13.162 --> 01:19:14.633
Paul, hang on, buddy!

01:19:17.768 --> 01:19:19.436
Paul!

01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:22.941
Hang on, buddy!
I'm coming!

01:19:34.552 --> 01:19:36.954
Need... to shield...

01:19:37.021 --> 01:19:38.689
slow the fall...

01:19:45.262 --> 01:19:46.731
All right, here we go.

01:19:46.796 --> 01:19:47.999
All right.

01:19:51.735 --> 01:19:53.438
Hang on, buddy.

01:20:05.282 --> 01:20:06.517
Hold on.

01:20:10.287 --> 01:20:11.488
Hold on!

01:20:16.894 --> 01:20:18.595
Here we go!

01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:21.598
Almost there.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.548
All right, buddy.
We're going too fast.

01:20:37.615 --> 01:20:39.584
We gotta find
a way to slow us down.

01:20:41.152 --> 01:20:43.755
Let me secure us.

01:21:20.791 --> 01:21:22.192
Here we go.

01:21:22.992 --> 01:21:24.396
All right.

01:21:25.196 --> 01:21:27.831
All right.

01:21:27.897 --> 01:21:32.870
You know you cried when Mom made
us share a bed on vacation.

01:21:34.103 --> 01:21:36.173
Look at us now.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:37.809
I'm gonna get you home
in one piece, brother.

01:21:44.048 --> 01:21:45.784
Okay. Hold on.

01:21:51.455 --> 01:21:53.624
Hold on!

01:22:08.305 --> 01:22:10.407
Hang on, bro!

01:22:15.446 --> 01:22:17.982
It's 50 below up here!

01:22:18.049 --> 01:22:19.684
But you gotta breathe, brother!

01:22:32.862 --> 01:22:35.765
Come on, man.

01:22:35.832 --> 01:22:37.134
You gotta breathe.

01:22:39.036 --> 01:22:42.138
This air's too thin for me,

01:22:42.205 --> 01:22:44.174
but you breathe
that oxygen, brother!

01:22:46.376 --> 01:22:47.845
Go on, breathe!

01:22:48.946 --> 01:22:50.348
Breathe.

01:23:28.018 --> 01:23:31.055
Come on, Jim.
Wake up!

01:23:31.121 --> 01:23:32.990
Wake up, man!

01:23:33.057 --> 01:23:34.358
Jim!

01:23:36.861 --> 01:23:38.162
Jim!

01:23:58.948 --> 01:24:00.617
Jim Lawson, do you copy?

01:24:07.223 --> 01:24:09.494
Jim Lawson, do you read this?

01:24:15.566 --> 01:24:18.101
Wake up, Jim! Come on!

01:24:18.168 --> 01:24:19.603
Jim!

01:24:24.909 --> 01:24:25.942
Oh!

01:24:26.009 --> 01:24:27.544
Oh, thank God!

01:24:27.611 --> 01:24:30.046
Thank God! Come on.
Get you up. Come on

01:24:37.254 --> 01:24:40.323
You did it!
You did it.

01:24:40.389 --> 01:24:41.959
We both did it.

01:24:42.026 --> 01:24:45.463
- I'm proud of you.
- I'm proud of you, man.

01:24:47.397 --> 01:24:48.900
I bet Dad is too, man.

01:24:50.067 --> 01:24:51.602
Yeah.

01:24:57.808 --> 01:25:00.544
<i>Gentlemen, congratulations.</i>

01:25:00.611 --> 01:25:02.679
Oh, Colonel Hauser!

01:25:02.745 --> 01:25:05.315
<i>We'll be sending a transport
to pick you up shortly.</i>

01:25:05.383 --> 01:25:06.884
<i>D.C. just reopened our bunker</i>

01:25:06.951 --> 01:25:08.218
<i>and there are a couple
of people down here</i>

01:25:08.285 --> 01:25:09.653
<i>who want to say hello.</i>

01:25:09.719 --> 01:25:12.121
<i>Paul? Are you there, Paul?</i>

01:25:12.188 --> 01:25:14.691
Juni! Juni, it's me.

01:25:14.758 --> 01:25:16.794
We did it!

01:25:16.861 --> 01:25:21.165
- <i>I love you so much.</i>
- <i>We love you, Daddy.</i>

01:25:21.231 --> 01:25:22.866
- <i>Come home!</i>
- I love you, too.

01:25:22.933 --> 01:25:25.169
Daddy's coming home!

01:25:25.236 --> 01:25:26.537
Come in, Jim Lawson!

01:25:30.073 --> 01:25:31.576
<i>Jim?</i>

01:25:31.642 --> 01:25:34.045
<i>Jim, it's Stacey!</i>

01:25:34.111 --> 01:25:37.282
<i>Jim, please tell me
you're okay.</i>

01:25:40.651 --> 01:25:43.887
<i>Stacey, is that you?</i>

01:25:43.954 --> 01:25:46.189
Jim, it's me.

01:25:46.256 --> 01:25:49.960
Are you okay?

01:25:50.027 --> 01:25:51.962
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:25:52.028 --> 01:25:53.464
Woo-hoo-hoo!

01:25:56.099 --> 01:25:57.567
Come home.

01:26:01.604 --> 01:26:02.874
<i>Come home, Jim.</i>

01:26:04.275 --> 01:26:06.344
I'm okay.
