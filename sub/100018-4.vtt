00:21.024 --> 00:23.024
<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:25.797 --> 00:27.296
- Hank?
<i>- We got trouble.</i>

00:27.297 --> 00:29.501
Dawn and I just got a visit
from Dr. Light.

00:29.533 --> 00:30.902
I thought
he was still in prison.

00:30.936 --> 00:32.679
<i>I guess he paroled himself.</i>

00:35.305 --> 00:36.975
- This is bad.
- No shit.

00:37.009 --> 00:39.152
<i>We should get together to figure this out.</i>

00:39.176 --> 00:41.243
What are you doing?
Starting all this again?

00:41.244 --> 00:42.379
Everything's changed.

00:42.380 --> 00:43.548
<i>You made them Titans.</i>

00:43.581 --> 00:45.282
Do they even know
what happened last time?

00:45.283 --> 00:46.783
After all the shit
that went down,

00:46.784 --> 00:49.387
I'd have thought you'd have
burned this place to the ground.

00:49.420 --> 00:51.054
The one and only
Deathstroke.

00:51.088 --> 00:52.422
Fuck me.

00:52.423 --> 00:53.590
- I thought he...
- He was dead.

00:53.591 --> 00:55.659
He's alive and well
in San Francisco.

00:55.694 --> 00:57.895
Deathstroke is why
we shuttered this place.

00:57.927 --> 00:59.396
<i>I didn't come for round two.</i>

00:59.399 --> 01:02.399
<i>Well, so much for
old home week.</i>

01:31.299 --> 01:32.598
<i>Our reports show that</i>

01:32.599 --> 01:35.065
<i>this is the most anticipated
trial of the year.</i>

01:35.066 --> 01:36.533
<i>Yes, that's right, Dan.</i>

01:36.534 --> 01:39.570
<i>It's day one of proceedings
of this high-profile case,</i>

01:39.603 --> 01:41.605
<i>and the prosecution's
two key witnesses</i>

01:41.638 --> 01:45.010
<i>have been flown in from the
Federal Penitentiary in Lompoc.</i>

01:45.043 --> 01:48.748
<i>Thank you, Rachel.
Please keep us posted.</i>

02:20.243 --> 02:22.112
Wait a minute. Slow down.

02:22.145 --> 02:25.846
Wait. Tell me that again.

02:28.552 --> 02:30.955
Oh, my God. He's dead?

03:04.155 --> 03:07.056
Case closed.

03:07.091 --> 03:11.829
To a job well done.

03:11.861 --> 03:14.164
Why the house call?

03:14.198 --> 03:18.703
Miss my irresistible charm?

03:18.736 --> 03:23.206
Thought I should deliver
your next assignment in person.

03:23.241 --> 03:27.311
This one's San Francisco.

03:27.344 --> 03:29.045
It's an unusual one.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.646
But easy.

03:30.681 --> 03:32.330
In and out.

04:34.211 --> 04:37.360
Hey, honey.

04:41.685 --> 04:43.521
Oh, you've been busy.

04:43.553 --> 04:47.824
Okay, okay.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

04:49.560 --> 04:52.930
Mmm. Mmm. Something amazing.

04:52.963 --> 04:55.266
Uh, mac and cheese?

04:57.401 --> 05:00.370
Oh, I'd know that smell
anywhere.

05:02.038 --> 05:05.788
Eggplant parm with basil.

05:12.716 --> 05:17.367
How many times have I told you?

05:26.262 --> 05:29.399
We don't ever
let down our guard.

05:29.432 --> 05:32.435
Okay?

05:32.470 --> 05:35.473
It's okay.

05:59.764 --> 06:02.632
You should have
kept going straight.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.735
Sign said no entry.

06:04.769 --> 06:06.103
Did you set it
to avoid freeways?

06:06.137 --> 06:08.148
When you guys are done being
losers, Google Maps is...

06:08.172 --> 06:12.072
John!

06:15.211 --> 06:16.514
No, no! No! No!

06:16.547 --> 06:18.081
Dad!

06:18.115 --> 06:21.084
Grab his wallet.

06:21.117 --> 06:22.286
John! Jo...

06:32.562 --> 06:35.999
Stay in the car, kid.
We got this.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
"We"?

06:37.001 --> 06:39.903
Hey, losers.

06:39.937 --> 06:42.473
Oh, fuck!

07:02.526 --> 07:05.028
Watch out!

07:19.043 --> 07:22.045
Think he's had
enough of a workout yet?

07:39.963 --> 07:43.233
Nice teamwork.

07:43.266 --> 07:45.867
Just doing my job.

07:55.012 --> 07:56.246
Sorry, bro.

07:56.247 --> 07:58.983
Get some tartar sauce
with those fish sticks.

07:59.016 --> 08:02.120
You don't know how long
I've been wanting to say that.

08:02.153 --> 08:05.220
Anyway, was I the only one that
noticed Johnny Ocean over here,

08:05.221 --> 08:06.524
chilling on the sidelines

08:06.557 --> 08:09.459
while the rest of us
did the heavy lifting?

08:09.492 --> 08:11.196
- He's still going?
- Yeah.

08:11.228 --> 08:13.898
And while we're all proud of the
work that we did last night

08:13.932 --> 08:16.199
to rid this city
of three scumbags...

08:16.233 --> 08:17.269
Here we go.

08:17.302 --> 08:19.737
...a special tip of the hat
to our birthday boy,

08:19.771 --> 08:22.874
who managed to lend a hand
despite being a year older

08:22.906 --> 08:25.543
and wetting everyone's pants.

08:25.576 --> 08:27.076
- Cheers.
- Hear, hear.

08:27.110 --> 08:28.913
Hear, hear.

08:28.947 --> 08:30.648
You've only been with us
four months.

08:30.680 --> 08:31.716
You ready to quit yet?

08:31.749 --> 08:34.652
No retreat. No surrender.

08:34.683 --> 08:37.654
Say, that's your best shot,
featherweight?

08:37.687 --> 08:39.923
Uh, I don't know.
I had a question, though.

08:39.957 --> 08:42.225
What is 22 in fish years?

08:42.259 --> 08:44.162
Like, 90?

08:44.195 --> 08:46.363
Ninety-year-old fish
is still faster

08:46.397 --> 08:48.732
than a beer-bellied bird,
my friend.

08:48.765 --> 08:53.765
Well, at least
a bird's got friends.

08:55.605 --> 08:57.774
Atlanteans got skills.

08:57.808 --> 08:59.777
Not with the ladies.

08:59.811 --> 09:03.080
Boo! Mic drop!

09:07.116 --> 09:09.352
Am I right?

09:23.168 --> 09:26.403
God forbid you allow yourself
to have a little fun.

09:26.437 --> 09:27.804
Frida Kahlo.

09:27.839 --> 09:31.609
It's all the fun a girl needs.

09:31.642 --> 09:34.511
Why don't you
give Garth a chance?

09:34.544 --> 09:37.413
You guys have great chemistry.

09:37.447 --> 09:39.182
Had.

09:39.216 --> 09:40.719
When we were kids.

09:40.751 --> 09:44.522
Plus, I'm not really into his whole
Atlantean "live for the moment" thing.

09:44.554 --> 09:47.057
Opposites attract.

09:47.091 --> 09:49.158
I'm here for a limited time.

09:49.192 --> 09:51.495
Focus is crucial.

09:51.528 --> 09:53.297
Mmm-hmm.

09:53.298 --> 09:54.231
So is cake.

09:54.232 --> 09:57.500
And we're about to
bring out Garth's.

09:57.534 --> 09:58.702
Oh.

09:58.735 --> 10:00.638
I'm on a sugar cleanse.

10:00.671 --> 10:03.407
Right. Okay, yeah.

10:03.441 --> 10:05.576
And I'm on a bullshit cleanse.

10:05.610 --> 10:07.010
What are you... Oh!

10:07.044 --> 10:08.812
- Okay! Okay! I'm coming.
- Okay.

10:14.317 --> 10:15.184
Where's the activator?

10:15.186 --> 10:17.020
Oh, I love this gladiator look.

10:17.022 --> 10:20.024
Reminds me of the time you
went Spartacus on Professor Su

10:20.057 --> 10:23.227
after failing
the freshman physics final.

10:23.260 --> 10:25.663
Anger issues intensify
if left untreated.

10:25.696 --> 10:28.732
You ever consider therapy?

10:28.765 --> 10:31.836
I'm not one for in-depth chats.

10:35.173 --> 10:37.741
The activator,
tell me where it is.

10:37.774 --> 10:39.844
A spectacular failure
whose only hope

10:39.845 --> 10:41.345
is to mooch off others.

10:41.346 --> 10:42.480
I heard your last experiment

10:42.513 --> 10:44.581
landed you
in the ICU for months.

10:44.582 --> 10:45.850
Sorry I forgot to send flowers.

10:45.883 --> 10:50.120
Yeah, you know what,
you forget a lot of things.

10:50.154 --> 10:52.722
Would your pedestal be so high

10:52.756 --> 10:54.625
without the insights

10:54.658 --> 10:58.729
from my "spectacular failures"?

10:58.763 --> 11:01.130
One man's trash
is another man's treasure.

11:23.888 --> 11:25.789
I've spent my entire life

11:25.822 --> 11:28.460
watching hollow heroes
lap up the glory.

11:28.493 --> 11:33.493
Any man who knocks me down
will suffer the consequences

11:33.965 --> 11:35.868
of his disrespect.

11:35.900 --> 11:39.669
I'm not giving you
what you want, you twisted fuck.

11:41.405 --> 11:42.405
Okay.

12:05.730 --> 12:07.697
Perhaps this'll
change your mind.

12:16.741 --> 12:17.942
<i>♪ Happy birthday ♪</i>

12:17.975 --> 12:19.110
Whoo! Here it is!

12:19.143 --> 12:20.977
<i>- ♪ Happy birthday ♪
- Wow.</i>

12:21.011 --> 12:22.913
<i>- ♪ Hap-happy day ♪
- Lovely.</i>

12:22.947 --> 12:26.116
Sorry I couldn't fit all 90
candles on there. I tried.

12:26.149 --> 12:28.719
My birthday gift to you
is that I'm not gonna sing.

12:28.753 --> 12:30.053
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

12:30.087 --> 12:32.256
Come on, I want my
Dick Grayson acapella serenade.

12:32.289 --> 12:34.258
Let's go, buddy. Let her rip.

12:34.259 --> 12:36.025
- Let's make it happen.
- Birthday boy request.

12:36.027 --> 12:37.326
- You heard him.
- Let's hear it, Pavarotti.

12:37.327 --> 12:41.365
All right, guys,
we're gonna do a group photo.

12:41.399 --> 12:45.469
Come on, get together.

12:45.501 --> 12:47.871
All right.

12:47.904 --> 12:49.941
Donna.

12:50.908 --> 12:54.312
One, two... Smile.

12:54.345 --> 12:55.745
Three.

12:57.548 --> 12:59.817
Great. A Polaroid.

12:59.850 --> 13:01.719
Now two things
that are older than dirt.

13:08.692 --> 13:10.427
Whole neighborhood's out.

13:10.461 --> 13:12.763
I'll check and see if Bruce's
mainframe is still up.

13:12.797 --> 13:16.667
I'll go get some candles.

13:16.701 --> 13:19.303
More cake for us.

13:19.336 --> 13:24.336
I should go help Dawn
with the candles.

13:34.619 --> 13:38.590
Any news on what caused
the birthday-bash-interruptus?

13:38.623 --> 13:40.991
There was an alert
at the Mission Substation.

13:41.024 --> 13:44.325
- Hmm.
- No details yet.

13:46.331 --> 13:47.931
You know,
with the lights out down here,

13:47.932 --> 13:51.981
it feels kinda like a cave.

13:53.037 --> 13:56.006
You like it?

13:56.039 --> 13:58.042
Yeah, I think I do.

13:58.076 --> 14:00.543
A little darkness,

14:00.577 --> 14:04.515
little danger.

14:04.548 --> 14:08.686
So the whole Batman thing
turns you on?

14:08.719 --> 14:10.888
No.

14:10.922 --> 14:13.322
Don't be Batman.

14:26.736 --> 14:29.106
Nice mood.

14:29.139 --> 14:31.241
Hey, you like Italian, right?

14:31.275 --> 14:35.745
Have you ever
been to La Ciccia?

14:35.779 --> 14:38.849
Food's too salty.

14:38.883 --> 14:41.119
Well, I heard
they brought in a new chef

14:41.152 --> 14:42.720
all the way from Sicily.

14:42.753 --> 14:43.854
Brand new tasting menu.

14:43.888 --> 14:47.191
I could make us a reservation.

14:47.225 --> 14:48.859
Kinda over Sicilian.

14:50.227 --> 14:51.928
Well, what about Acquerello?

14:51.962 --> 14:54.197
Hard pass on anything "acqua"

14:55.667 --> 14:59.937
I'm scrambling here, Donna.
I mean, what's a guy gotta do?

14:59.971 --> 15:01.538
I don't have time for dating.

15:01.572 --> 15:04.107
I've got a lot to do
before I leave.

15:04.142 --> 15:08.412
Ah, to The-mascara.

15:08.445 --> 15:09.947
It's Themyscira.

15:09.980 --> 15:11.148
And yes.

15:11.149 --> 15:12.449
Now why do you want
to go back to a place

15:12.450 --> 15:13.850
that no one can even pronounce?

15:13.884 --> 15:15.485
I don't have a choice.

15:15.519 --> 15:19.355
Yes, you do, Donna.

15:19.389 --> 15:20.857
Right?

15:20.890 --> 15:22.759
Bottle of Cabernet,

15:22.793 --> 15:26.297
picnic dinner,
black sands beach.

15:26.331 --> 15:27.832
You can show me
if you still remember

15:27.865 --> 15:32.365
that trick I taught you for
swimming against the current.

15:36.474 --> 15:39.743
I should blow the candles out.

15:39.777 --> 15:41.576
Fire hazard.

16:24.355 --> 16:27.455
Let's make a withdrawal.

16:28.793 --> 16:31.828
An explosion at the bank
with no explosives.

16:31.861 --> 16:33.197
We're talking a Super.

16:33.230 --> 16:36.100
Can't find Donna.
I texted her to meet us.

16:36.134 --> 16:38.936
Avoiding work and play.

16:38.970 --> 16:41.970
At least she's consistent.

17:05.497 --> 17:10.146
So, what is all the fuss about?

17:15.507 --> 17:19.000
Six months ago, you begged me
to stay in San Francisco.

17:19.009 --> 17:21.512
Insisting you deserve time
to explore

17:21.546 --> 17:23.815
your independence from Diana

17:23.848 --> 17:28.751
with your indie-rock group
of vigilante friends.

17:28.786 --> 17:31.754
And now you want to go home?

17:31.755 --> 17:34.491
I was procrastinating.

17:34.526 --> 17:37.260
As a young girl,
the idea of becoming a warrior,

17:37.295 --> 17:38.829
I couldn't wait.

17:38.864 --> 17:43.864
But now that the time's come
to actually commit...

17:46.637 --> 17:48.805
We waged
the great battles

17:48.806 --> 17:51.142
and wear the scars.

17:51.174 --> 17:53.810
That seems daunting?

17:53.844 --> 17:56.180
No.

17:56.213 --> 17:59.750
This is my destiny.

17:59.782 --> 18:04.020
And I'm ready.

18:04.055 --> 18:07.290
This is about Garth.

18:07.325 --> 18:10.193
Next time, don't waste
so much energy deflecting.

18:11.362 --> 18:14.398
Atlanteans are
highly-skilled warriors.

18:14.432 --> 18:16.835
And troublemakers.

18:16.867 --> 18:21.105
And clearly, Garth's been
blessed with other...

18:21.137 --> 18:25.808
noble attributes.

18:25.843 --> 18:27.778
So you've been following me?

18:27.811 --> 18:30.881
Surely you don't think I'd let
you run around with your friends

18:30.914 --> 18:32.584
without keeping tabs?

18:32.616 --> 18:35.086
By the way, the next time
you need a good birthday cake,

18:35.118 --> 18:37.221
I recommend Tartine
in the Mission.

18:37.255 --> 18:38.757
They have a divine dacquoise.

18:38.789 --> 18:40.758
Mmm, well,
since you know everything,

18:40.790 --> 18:41.892
I'll just shut up.

18:41.925 --> 18:43.428
Quite the contrary.

18:43.461 --> 18:45.630
You asked for more time here,
I granted it.

18:45.663 --> 18:46.964
You still have six months left

18:46.998 --> 18:50.968
whether you want to use it
or not, that's your choice.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.373
Sometimes it's not.

18:55.405 --> 18:58.442
My exhibit closes in two weeks.

18:58.476 --> 19:02.113
If you'd like to leave
for Themyscira then,

19:02.145 --> 19:06.195
I'll make the arrangements.

19:17.961 --> 19:19.529
Perimeter's clear.

19:19.564 --> 19:21.932
- How bad is it inside?
- Four dead.

19:21.967 --> 19:24.336
About half a dozen others
with third-degree burns.

19:24.368 --> 19:27.471
Witnesses say the suspect seemed to
have light running through his veins.

19:27.472 --> 19:28.535
Blasted it
from an armored vest.

19:28.538 --> 19:30.407
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

19:30.441 --> 19:31.809
So what else have we got?

19:31.843 --> 19:34.645
Apparently no money was stolen.
Just a safety deposit box.

19:34.679 --> 19:36.681
We're gonna dig and find out
who it belongs to.

19:36.713 --> 19:39.383
See what this electric cowboy
was after.

19:39.384 --> 19:41.450
Someone should comb through
surveillance of the area,

19:41.451 --> 19:42.885
try to ID our suspect.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.788
- Got it.
- I'm on it.

19:44.823 --> 19:47.823
Great.
We'll meet you guys at home.

20:01.038 --> 20:05.209
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Freeze it there.

20:05.242 --> 20:06.944
Look at this.

20:06.978 --> 20:10.647
This woman let her Pomeranian
take a dump and didn't scoop it.

20:10.650 --> 20:11.781
You know,
just because it's small,

20:11.782 --> 20:14.218
doesn't mean
you're off the hook, lady.

20:14.251 --> 20:18.189
Ah, the guy with the beefcakes
is our man.

20:18.190 --> 20:19.355
Watching the rest
of this footage

20:19.356 --> 20:21.992
is like watching cement dry.

20:22.027 --> 20:27.027
Well, maybe this will
spice things up a bit.

20:28.266 --> 20:30.468
No way.

20:30.500 --> 20:31.935
Where did you get that?

20:31.969 --> 20:34.570
I have my people.

20:34.571 --> 20:35.571
Plus,

20:35.573 --> 20:39.943
I remember it used to be
your favorite, so...

20:40.945 --> 20:43.847
I haven't had this
since I was a kid.

20:43.882 --> 20:45.816
I thought
they stopped making this.

20:45.848 --> 20:47.798
Yeah, me too.

20:52.256 --> 20:53.557
Oh, my God.

20:53.558 --> 20:54.990
- The bubbles hurt your tongue.
- Bubbles hurt my tongue.

20:54.991 --> 20:55.991
Yeah.

20:55.992 --> 20:59.143
In a good way though.

21:04.501 --> 21:06.402
Do, do you remember
the first time

21:06.403 --> 21:07.538
we had that together?

21:07.571 --> 21:10.642
Oh, yeah. New Year's Eve.

21:10.674 --> 21:12.710
Diana said we were too young
to drink champagne.

21:12.743 --> 21:15.480
- Mmm-hmm.
- So I got this instead.

21:15.512 --> 21:17.749
Our "bubbly."

21:17.781 --> 21:19.849
Pretty slick moves
for a 12-year-old.

21:19.883 --> 21:21.086
- Me?
- Mmm-hmm.

21:21.118 --> 21:23.063
Are you kidding? You were the
one with the slick moves,

21:23.087 --> 21:25.022
convincing an innocent
young man like myself

21:25.056 --> 21:27.625
to sneak out past curfew
to go see the fireworks.

21:27.659 --> 21:31.496
Mmm-mmm-mmm. You said that
they looked cool under water.

21:31.497 --> 21:32.762
You can't tempt a girl
like that

21:32.763 --> 21:34.398
and expect her to sit at home.

21:34.432 --> 21:37.143
I forgot how cold the water was that
time of year for non-Atlanteans.

21:37.167 --> 21:39.135
Uh, it was fine.

21:39.170 --> 21:41.571
I wanted to find Nemo.

21:41.605 --> 21:44.974
- Oh, believe me, I remember.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:45.009 --> 21:47.644
Your lips turning blue,

21:47.679 --> 21:49.145
but you kept looking.

21:49.180 --> 21:50.548
And you kept saying,

21:50.580 --> 21:53.684
"Clownfish don't live in waters
that aren't tropical."

21:53.718 --> 21:57.153
That's because they don't.

21:57.188 --> 21:58.690
Right.

21:58.722 --> 22:02.323
Then how come I found...

22:09.333 --> 22:10.768
You did that.

22:10.801 --> 22:15.801
You brought that clownfish
for me.

22:21.011 --> 22:23.913
I have to leave, Garth.
You know that.

22:23.946 --> 22:25.449
So do I.

22:25.482 --> 22:27.732
Someday. Right?

22:34.759 --> 22:38.061
Hey, did you guys
find anything...

22:38.095 --> 22:41.332
Oh. Sorry.

22:41.365 --> 22:46.365
Dick wants to
get the team together.

22:50.607 --> 22:52.609
Suspect's name
is Dr. Arthur Light.

22:52.643 --> 22:55.747
He has a doctorate degree
in physics from Caltech.

22:55.779 --> 22:57.882
He gained his powers
from a failed experiment

22:57.915 --> 23:00.317
with light manipulation,
where he was badly hurt.

23:00.351 --> 23:02.554
Well, we can't
all be Einsteins.

23:02.587 --> 23:05.399
- You would know.
- Up until yesterday, he was a low level threat.

23:05.423 --> 23:07.557
Turns out he fried a friend
of his named Jacob Finlay

23:07.558 --> 23:11.628
in order to get access to an activator
he kept in a safety deposit box.

23:11.630 --> 23:13.129
And we all know
how it went from there.

23:13.130 --> 23:14.165
An activator for what?

23:14.199 --> 23:17.968
I guarantee
he's not the Energizer Bunny.

23:18.001 --> 23:20.305
Let's dig.

23:20.338 --> 23:25.338
We find out that answer,
we find our lead on Dr. Light.

24:06.718 --> 24:09.153
Ah, just the man
I'm looking for.

24:09.185 --> 24:10.954
- Find any leads?
- No.

24:10.989 --> 24:13.123
Could use
a little advice though.

24:13.156 --> 24:14.726
About Donna.

24:14.759 --> 24:16.594
I'm not sure
I'm the right guy to talk to.

24:16.626 --> 24:18.430
Oh, right, I'm sorry.

24:18.462 --> 24:21.865
Probably shouldn't ask the guy with the
whip-smart, beautiful blonde girlfriend.

24:21.900 --> 24:23.567
Right time, right place.

24:23.601 --> 24:25.134
After Dawn's
crash-and-burn with Hank,

24:25.135 --> 24:27.204
she probably just need
someone to fill the void.

24:27.239 --> 24:29.874
Oh, yes, 'cause we all know
Dawn is the type of woman

24:29.907 --> 24:32.576
who just can't
live without a man.

24:32.609 --> 24:35.079
Me, I'm like lovesick Christian

24:35.113 --> 24:39.851
trying to get Roxane
to look my way.

24:39.884 --> 24:42.220
<i>Cyrano de Bergerac.</i>

24:42.253 --> 24:44.387
I thought Bruce made you
read the classics.

24:44.422 --> 24:45.990
If it wasn't about power,
domination

24:46.023 --> 24:51.023
or suppressing my emotions,
Bruce didn't have me read it.

24:51.229 --> 24:53.564
Look, want my advice?
Donna Troy doesn't get thrown.

24:53.597 --> 24:55.298
Ever.

24:55.332 --> 24:57.300
- Since you got here...
- Yeah.

24:57.334 --> 24:59.269
So what do I gotta do?

24:59.303 --> 25:00.872
Nothing.

25:00.904 --> 25:02.573
Look, it's like
flooding a car engine.

25:02.606 --> 25:04.741
You keep pumping the gas,
the more it floods.

25:04.776 --> 25:08.011
Take your foot off the pedal
and wait.

25:08.046 --> 25:10.580
I've been waiting
for Donna Troy since I was 12.

25:10.615 --> 25:14.414
So what's a little longer?

25:44.648 --> 25:46.651
I bet your ears are burning.

25:46.683 --> 25:48.152
I know.

25:48.184 --> 25:51.184
I saw Garth leaving.

25:53.424 --> 25:56.393
Even if I was at liberty to
tell you what that was about,

25:56.426 --> 25:57.728
which I'm not,

25:57.761 --> 26:02.666
I'm pretty sure it's nothing
you don't already know.

26:02.700 --> 26:04.335
We need to talk.

26:04.367 --> 26:06.537
He's right down the hall.

26:06.569 --> 26:09.207
You and I.

26:09.240 --> 26:13.376
I went to see Jillian
about my time here.

26:13.410 --> 26:15.013
Again?

26:15.047 --> 26:17.824
I thought she was the one that said you
deserve time to explore your independence.

26:17.848 --> 26:19.549
She sanctioned it.

26:19.583 --> 26:21.618
What Jillian giveth,

26:21.652 --> 26:24.488
Jillian taketh away.

26:24.521 --> 26:26.824
She's pulling you?

26:26.857 --> 26:30.627
She changed her mind.

26:30.661 --> 26:33.297
I need to
go back to Themyscira.

26:36.032 --> 26:38.568
When?

26:38.603 --> 26:40.002
Tonight.

26:42.472 --> 26:43.673
Bullshit!

26:43.708 --> 26:46.443
You need more time here.

26:46.444 --> 26:47.544
Do you want me to talk to her?

26:47.545 --> 26:48.912
No. You can't
talk her out of this.

26:48.913 --> 26:53.512
She's thought it through
and this is how it has to be.

26:56.921 --> 26:59.723
- You need to tell Garth.
- I know.

26:59.757 --> 27:04.757
I just need to find
the right moment.

27:07.798 --> 27:11.101
- So I guess this is...
- Oh, don't.

27:11.134 --> 27:12.670
Me and you,

27:12.702 --> 27:15.740
no goodbyes.

27:20.510 --> 27:22.211
You got a hit.

27:22.246 --> 27:24.015
The U.S. military?

27:24.048 --> 27:25.915
Jacob's activator
was for a laser

27:25.916 --> 27:30.477
that was developed
to take down nuclear missiles.

27:51.909 --> 27:54.144
New intel
on the military cargo shipment.

27:54.179 --> 27:55.779
They're loading up at 2100.

27:55.813 --> 27:58.481
Great. Just what we need.
Less time.

27:58.482 --> 28:00.217
If Dr. Light
gets his hands on that laser,

28:00.218 --> 28:02.667
he'll be like
a walking nuclear bomb.

28:26.277 --> 28:27.944
I got two men down
in the warehouse.

28:27.979 --> 28:30.378
North-east corner.
Right now! Right now!

29:44.654 --> 29:46.290
Three's the charm.

29:46.324 --> 29:50.027
<i>Inside.
We're under fire!</i>

29:50.060 --> 29:55.060
He got to the laser!
We need backup!

29:56.800 --> 29:58.435
Garth, don't!

29:58.470 --> 30:00.738
Should have sang to me
on my birthday.

30:00.770 --> 30:03.507
Might have been
your last chance.

30:15.019 --> 30:17.118
Aah!

30:20.924 --> 30:21.992
Hank, Dawn,

30:22.026 --> 30:23.625
<i>flank him.</i>

30:40.277 --> 30:41.362
Now!

30:57.528 --> 30:59.730
Nice teamwork.

30:59.763 --> 31:02.463
Just doing my job.

31:31.028 --> 31:34.765
Troy.

31:34.798 --> 31:38.303
Burgers and beer.
Do you wanna come?

31:38.336 --> 31:40.738
Don't worry. Just as friends.

31:40.770 --> 31:43.621
Hank's coming, too.

34:08.452 --> 34:10.621
Hey.

34:10.652 --> 34:13.623
Hey.

34:13.657 --> 34:14.891
How you doing?

34:14.925 --> 34:18.074
I don't know.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.900
Donna stopped by your room?

34:22.931 --> 34:25.768
Yeah. Yeah.

34:25.802 --> 34:28.172
Sort of.

34:28.206 --> 34:31.806
So, how are you feeling?

34:35.945 --> 34:38.514
Amazing?

34:41.920 --> 34:45.789
I mean, I have been thinking
about this night since I met Donna.

34:45.822 --> 34:48.159
You know, Dick? And...

34:48.192 --> 34:50.193
- It's like all of a sudden...
- Hold on. Wait.

34:50.228 --> 34:52.295
So you didn't
talk about anything?

34:52.329 --> 34:54.431
No, we didn't need to.

34:54.465 --> 34:57.735
I mean,
after all of these years,

34:57.768 --> 35:02.768
you know, I can't believe
that we just finally...

35:09.146 --> 35:10.146
What?

35:23.527 --> 35:27.530
I trust your goodbyes
were brief, but meaningful.

35:27.563 --> 35:29.367
Yes.

35:29.400 --> 35:33.237
Donna!

35:33.271 --> 35:35.572
This is why you slept with me?

35:35.574 --> 35:36.839
'Cause you knew you had an out?

35:36.840 --> 35:38.643
Can we please
not do this right now?

35:38.675 --> 35:41.945
No. I'm like you, looking for
that damn clownfish.

35:41.978 --> 35:43.481
I don't give up that easy.

35:43.514 --> 35:45.516
What does this have to do
with clownfish?

35:45.550 --> 35:50.121
- Everything!
- Nothing!

35:50.153 --> 35:52.456
I'm sorry about tonight.

35:52.489 --> 35:55.092
That's what happens
when you live for the moment.

35:55.126 --> 35:56.661
Right.

35:56.693 --> 35:58.999
Because you're the fierce
Amazon warrior

35:59.000 --> 36:00.297
and I'm the impulsive Atlantean

36:00.331 --> 36:04.001
who drifts wherever
the current takes me, right?

36:04.034 --> 36:05.135
No.

36:05.168 --> 36:08.943
Donna, don't run.

36:10.708 --> 36:15.378
You're asking me to choose
between my destiny and you.

36:15.413 --> 36:19.762
Maybe they're the same thing.

36:23.052 --> 36:25.889
I love you, Donna Troy.

36:25.922 --> 36:30.161
I always have.

36:30.193 --> 36:32.893
And I always will.

36:51.681 --> 36:52.681
Garth!

37:05.096 --> 37:09.065
So should I send the jet home?

37:22.846 --> 37:25.349
Garth!

37:30.387 --> 37:32.822
- Garth!
- Come on. Come on!

38:06.157 --> 38:11.061
I need to stay here.

38:11.094 --> 38:15.932
The team needs me.

38:15.965 --> 38:17.615
Be careful.

38:21.105 --> 38:25.605
Vengeance is a dangerous path.

39:28.938 --> 39:30.945
Oh, you're back.

39:30.974 --> 39:32.376
I'm so sorry.

39:32.409 --> 39:36.280
If I hadn't left,

39:36.313 --> 39:37.514
it wouldn't have happened.

39:37.547 --> 39:39.382
No. No, no.

39:39.416 --> 39:41.150
He would have never been there.

39:41.184 --> 39:43.487
Don't blame yourself.

39:43.521 --> 39:47.621
We don't know
what this is about.

39:53.664 --> 39:56.563
I found the shooter.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.840
His name is Deathstroke.

40:11.882 --> 40:15.186
We're gonna
hunt this fucker down,

40:15.219 --> 40:17.768
and make him pay.

40:20.291 --> 40:25.262
Now's the time.

40:25.295 --> 40:26.795
Be Batman.

40:53.724 --> 40:55.974
See you, buddy.

41:09.440 --> 41:10.775
Hey.

41:10.807 --> 41:15.311
Got new ones in yesterday.
You get first dibs, as usual.
