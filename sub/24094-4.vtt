00:32.406 --> 00:34.034
Is this foil?

00:35.452 --> 00:36.953
Or a razor blade?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.456
Jamal Turner. Jamal Turner.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.458
Please report to the office.

00:49.674 --> 00:52.010
I'm so sorry for your loss.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.555
- Your grandma's picking you up outside.
- My grandma?

00:56.097 --> 00:57.390
My grandma lives in Tennessee.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.610
Ven aquí.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.070
Ahorita.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.789
Rose Westbrook.

01:22.248 --> 01:26.294
Rose is Frankie's girlfriend.
The one I made the dress for.

01:27.837 --> 01:31.633
She was the negrita dancer on the negrito
dance show with the negrito choo choo.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.511
What's a negrito dance show
and what's a negrito choo choo?

01:34.594 --> 01:36.095
I'm not your secretary. Use the Google.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.430
The... The what?

01:37.514 --> 01:40.183
You ask too many preguntas.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.603
Now it's time for you to find the answers.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.188
Váyase.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.197
Answers to what?

01:54.906 --> 01:58.159
RollerWorld. You're gonna find the money.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.079
Oh.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.255
Damn it. Now I got to walk back.

02:19.931 --> 02:20.765
Ah!

02:20.849 --> 02:23.643
She danced on Soul Train.
That's what choo choo means.

02:23.726 --> 02:25.186
Eighty-six the chitchat and focus.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.732
This is gonna be our best shut-in ever.
But we have to follow protocol.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.776
- Dude, we know the drill.
- This year's different.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.570
It's not about our survival.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.322
It's about Olivia.
There was magic in our first dance.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.782
You guys ever been to Brentwood?

02:37.866 --> 02:40.994
My parents are out
so I set up touch control LED lighting.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.621
Bordello Red.

02:43.705 --> 02:48.376
And Nightmare on Elm Street is gonna get
Olivia a little scared and a little lappy.

02:48.459 --> 02:50.795
- You know that's creepy, right?
- One step ahead of you.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.839
- Little cover in case of wood.
- Speaking of wood.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.674
Brentwood sounds kind of fun.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.843
- Where's Cesar sitting?
- In Oscar's Impala.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.095
- He's not coming? Why? It's tradition.
- Who cares?

02:59.178 --> 03:02.724
- I have the perfect one to one P/V ratio.
- P/V ratio?

03:02.807 --> 03:05.560
Olivia and me. And Jamal and you.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.021
- Never ever put my V with Jamal's P.
- Duly noted.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.440
Shut-in!

03:10.523 --> 03:13.151
- But I thought you were with Oscar.
- Good to see you too.

03:13.234 --> 03:15.028
No, it's fine. It's just...

03:15.904 --> 03:17.572
Take a seat. Any seat.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.533
Not the love seat.
And don't block my scented candle.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.290
What do you think?

03:28.416 --> 03:31.002
- That looks nice.
- So, when are we going out?

03:31.085 --> 03:33.546
Never.
Trick-or-treating in Freeridge is a no-go.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.298
Why?

03:35.381 --> 03:36.424
You might wanna sit down.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.259
I'll be brief.

03:39.969 --> 03:42.138
In 2012, Prophets rolled up on us.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.182
Glocks to our heads
and snatched our bags.

03:44.265 --> 03:47.602
2013 we were kissing pavement all night.
Caught in a drive-by.

03:48.102 --> 03:51.314
That night, we lost our candy
and perhaps our innocence.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.232
Can we talk?

03:52.315 --> 03:53.858
- Here the trick-or-treat threat level...
- I'm good.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.610
- ...is always red.
- That blows.

03:55.693 --> 03:56.653
So we're stuck inside?

03:56.736 --> 03:57.779
Brentwood.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.908
Why haven't you returned
any calls or texts?

04:01.991 --> 04:04.452
Been busy. You know,
tagging, jacking, banging.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.162
Even ran a yellow light.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.998
- You're still mad over my "safe" comment?
- Not safe.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.334
Seriously? I said what I said
and had to say it

04:11.417 --> 04:13.169
because if I didn't it,
I'd have to say more,

04:13.253 --> 04:15.505
and saying more
is not what I should've said.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.882
You're being overly sensitive.
Want me to apologize?

04:17.966 --> 04:21.844
I want you to want to apologize,
but you'd have to have feelings for that.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.723
Scary movies, artisan pizza,

04:25.807 --> 04:28.476
and most of all, new experiences.

04:28.559 --> 04:30.436
You're right. We should go out.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.064
I'm feeling like this could be
our last Halloween trick-or-treating.

04:33.147 --> 04:36.442
And frankly, it's feeling
a little cramped in here. You feel me?

04:36.526 --> 04:39.028
I vote for Brentwood. It's safe, rich,

04:39.112 --> 04:41.030
and I bet they've got
full-size candy bars.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.367
Shut-ins are tradition.
And I ordered the pizza.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.493
Did I mention it's artisanal?

04:46.369 --> 04:48.037
- Why can't we go somewhere else?
- Brentwood.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.707
- There's gotta be other places.
- Brentwood.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.083
- How about Brentwood?
- I'm down.

04:52.166 --> 04:54.794
- Good call, Olivia.
- It's a bad call. It's a great idea.

04:54.877 --> 04:58.214
It's just Brentwood's super far
and we would have to take public transpo,

04:58.298 --> 05:00.508
- which sucks.
- You've never been on the train.

05:00.591 --> 05:02.719
Sorry, guys, but I don't know
how we'd even get there.

05:02.802 --> 05:03.636
All good.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.140
I got us a hook-up.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.232
Easy. That's my bad arm.

05:16.816 --> 05:17.984
Buena suerte.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.905
We don't need luck. It's Brentwood.
Nothing bad happens here.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.824
How about OJ? No offense, Jamal.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.617
Oh, I'm good. We don't claim him.

05:26.993 --> 05:30.371
- So, we should be ready around 10:00.
- Good for you, but I have plans.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.715
We are not in Freeridge anymore.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.384
- In 800 feet, you have arrived.
- No.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.180
We've got lots of ground to cover, so...

05:47.722 --> 05:51.142
to maximize candy efficiency, let's divide
and conquer, then split our booty.

05:51.225 --> 05:55.396
Great idea. Olivia and I will go this way.
Meet back here around 10:00?

05:55.813 --> 05:56.773
Later.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.068
- Jamal!
- Jamal!

06:00.526 --> 06:02.737
On second thought,
I'll go with Ruby and Olivia.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.947
On third thought, you should go
with Jamal and Monse.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.532
On fourth thought, we're good.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.494
Come on.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.830
This is really getting old.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.249
We're skipping all the big houses
with crazy decorations

06:15.333 --> 06:16.876
and you want to hit up... Tootsie Rolls.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.799
What are you doing?
Buckets equal self-service.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.219
Trick-or-treat!

06:26.719 --> 06:30.139
Baby, bucket equals self-service.

06:30.473 --> 06:34.018
- Happy Halloween.
- Oh, my God!

06:34.102 --> 06:37.522
- Did you... Did you dance on Soul Train?
- What do you know about Soul Train?

06:37.605 --> 06:40.691
It was only the dopest dance show ever.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.820
I mean, my mama loved it.
My mama's mama loved it.

06:44.445 --> 06:46.823
And that dance line was the bomb.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.200
I invented the dance line.

06:49.283 --> 06:52.370
Wow, that's so cool!
But we really should get going.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.247
A legend like you...

06:54.413 --> 06:56.582
- I bet you've got stories for days.
- Well...

06:57.125 --> 07:01.129
- Damn! Is that a gold record?
- Mm-hmm.

07:01.212 --> 07:05.133
Would it be too much
if I asked for a selfie in front of it?

07:05.216 --> 07:07.051
You know, for my mama's mama.

07:07.135 --> 07:10.221
Well, we can't keep
your mama's mama hanging.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.266
Come on.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.317
Dude, let the little kids go first.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.029
Cesar tends to be one-track.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.865
You know, loses sight of others.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.700
Me? I'm a gentleman.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.785
I prefer to give before I receive.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.414
Hold on, still one more little one.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.171
So cute.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.552
And now what you're looking at

07:49.635 --> 07:52.513
is the first dancer
to have a number one hit.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.056
That's dope, Rose.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.642
Actually, it's pronounced Ro-say.

07:56.726 --> 07:57.977
Oh.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.687
- After your favorite wine?
- No.

07:59.770 --> 08:02.940
After this other bitch named Rose
started dancing on the Train.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.485
Oh, I'm blowing up.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.075
So, what was Don Cornelius like?

08:13.659 --> 08:16.704
Child, rest his soul. The man was handsy.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.332
Couldn't keep his fingers off this jelly.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.542
Is that why you left the Train
for Solid Gold?

08:21.626 --> 08:25.171
Oh, no, baby. I left for the green.
Plus my moves ain't free.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.965
And I was tired of living
in a sugar shack.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.509
So you bought that place in Sherman Oaks.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.593
Yeah, I...

08:31.802 --> 08:33.054
How did you know?

08:34.889 --> 08:37.725
Where else would
a lady baller like you live?

08:37.808 --> 08:41.145
I read that it was like
the Paris of the Valley back in the day.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.688
So how'd you get started? Dance school?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.775
No, more like dance parties.

08:45.858 --> 08:50.363
Or any place they played music,
like the Florentine Gardens, Osko's...

08:51.155 --> 08:53.407
- Oh, RollerWorld.
- RollerWorld?

08:53.491 --> 08:54.659
Yeah, you know it?

08:56.118 --> 08:57.620
I've heard about it once or twice.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.039
Oh!

09:00.122 --> 09:01.958
Time's up. My chili's ready.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.335
Our time's up too. We need to go.

09:04.418 --> 09:08.381
Baby. Baby, hold up. I'll be right back.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.387
RollerWorld?

09:14.470 --> 09:16.639
That's why we came to Brentwood?
So you could Dateline this shit?

09:17.431 --> 09:19.600
Jamal, we're leaving now
or I'm gonna kill you.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.144
That's exactly what I was thinking.

09:25.815 --> 09:29.068
Ruby, isn't it nice not to have
to look over your shoulder for once?

09:30.861 --> 09:33.155
Damn. We forgot Ruby. Where's Ruby?

09:33.239 --> 09:34.615
Back here, asshole.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.285
Uh... Give me a sec.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.456
- What's your problem?
- What's my problem?

09:42.540 --> 09:43.666
What's your problem?

09:43.749 --> 09:47.878
You just confused me with a nine-year-old,
who admittedly is big for her age.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.213
And what's with the cock-blocking?

09:49.297 --> 09:51.382
I W-4'd Olivia.

09:51.465 --> 09:54.260
As in I claimed her. And I'm working
on getting my first kiss tonight,

09:54.343 --> 09:55.761
and don't need you to do that thing.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.054
- What thing?
- That thing.

09:57.138 --> 10:00.308
I mean, that thing you do
with your face...

10:00.391 --> 10:01.434
when you say words...

10:01.517 --> 10:02.602
with your mouth.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.771
Don't be you!
This was supposed to be my night.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.524
- I had the perfect P/V ratio.
- The what?

10:08.608 --> 10:10.651
Penis to vagina ratio.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.487
Calm down. I'm not into Olivia, okay?

10:13.571 --> 10:15.656
Then quit working against me
and talk me up.

10:16.657 --> 10:17.742
Hey, everything cool?

10:18.075 --> 10:20.870
Most def. Hey, did you know
Ruby crushes one-arm push-ups?

10:20.953 --> 10:21.954
Show her, Ruby.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.291
You know what would be crazy cool?

10:26.042 --> 10:27.501
If we crashed that party.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.632
I don't know. They look like
they're at capacity.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.592
We don't wanna create a fire hazard.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.720
- Will you excuse us again?
- Yeah.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.311
If you don't want me to be me,
you need to not be you.

10:45.394 --> 10:46.687
Me? What's wrong with me?

10:46.771 --> 10:48.648
"I don't know.
They look like they're at capacity,

10:48.731 --> 10:50.316
and we don't wanna create a fire hazard."

10:50.399 --> 10:52.109
She just said
she wants to go to the party.

10:52.193 --> 10:55.613
For once, be Outside Ruben
and take her to the party.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.407
Come on.

10:59.283 --> 11:01.744
New plan. Let's tear that party up!

11:02.453 --> 11:03.579
Yes.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.416
Are you casing my place?

11:07.833 --> 11:11.003
You think I'm a fool?
I saw you taking pictures.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.798
And you're asking way too many questions.

11:17.760 --> 11:18.928
You better come correct, boy.

11:20.137 --> 11:23.182
Don't look at me.
If I had a gun, I'd shoot you myself.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.311
Is the RollerWorld heist real?

11:27.395 --> 11:29.522
Are the rumors true?
Is there still money out there?

11:31.315 --> 11:33.567
You want the skinny on RollerWorld?

11:37.029 --> 11:38.280
What's in it for me?

11:57.258 --> 11:58.926
Everyone here's so friendly.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.345
I told someone I was from Freeridge
and got major props.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.304
Hood must be trending.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.807
Here are some napkins and lemon wedges.

12:05.474 --> 12:08.144
You're so thoughtful
and always such a gentleman.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.063
Gentleman, scholar,
and a damn good swimmer too.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.984
Excuse me, it's time
for my adventure to find the bathroom

12:15.067 --> 12:16.819
and wait in a long line.

12:19.488 --> 12:22.700
Okay, so thanks for propping me up.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.661
Just a small note,
the swimmer comment was a little much.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.415
Great intent, but a bit of a stretch.
Think grounded.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.000
Point taken, Mr. Gentleman.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.626
Ah, I know, right?

12:32.710 --> 12:35.754
Looks like this gentleman
is gonna get his throat tickled.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.047
Wrong euphemism, dude.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.383
Um... Who amongst us aced Gifted English?

12:39.467 --> 12:40.843
It's "among."

12:40.926 --> 12:43.095
Among, amongst.
One's a variant of the other.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.765
Oh, no, I totally zoned out
on Jamal and Monse.

12:46.849 --> 12:47.850
Send them our location.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.103
You sure? You know how Monse is.
She'll start problems with her mouth.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.856
No, not tonight.
We're like rock stars here.

12:54.231 --> 12:56.358
- Yo, Amy!
- What's up, Ruby?

12:59.945 --> 13:01.071
Is this enough?

13:03.574 --> 13:07.119
Ooh, perfect. Now, come show
these wine glasses some love.

13:07.536 --> 13:10.581
How we doing on the cheese?
I need you to grate all that.

13:10.664 --> 13:13.000
I got the whole block coming for my chili.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.504
Damn, I haven't seen these boys in years.

13:16.587 --> 13:17.421
Mm.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.631
Who's that playa?

13:19.131 --> 13:21.800
- Is he wearing a fishnet crop top?
- Okay.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.053
Yes.

13:25.012 --> 13:25.888
That's Frankie.

13:26.430 --> 13:27.681
Fine as hell.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.225
But dumb as dirt, hear?

13:30.351 --> 13:31.393
That's why him and Benito...

13:31.477 --> 13:33.896
Now, Benito's the one
with the flavor saver...

13:33.979 --> 13:36.065
That's why they got pinched
for RollerWorld.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.651
You don't go flashing green
when the blue is onto you.

13:38.734 --> 13:41.111
And they loved flashing the green.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.615
Even leased me a Trans Am,
which unfortunately, was yellow.

13:44.698 --> 13:47.034
So, he spent all the money?

13:47.576 --> 13:49.537
Far as I know,
there wasn't that much to spend.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.414
So, there could be more.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.127
- Who's that other guy?
- This one is Lil' Ricky.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.464
Was he part of the heist too?

14:00.548 --> 14:02.883
No. He was too smart for that.

14:02.967 --> 14:06.595
But if he was into it,
he was way too smart to get busted.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.890
They were all so tight.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.435
They started the Freeridge Santos.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.605
You dated a Santo?
What was that like?

14:16.689 --> 14:18.649
- Isn't that a little personal?
- Said the stalker.

14:20.818 --> 14:21.694
I don't mind.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.904
Come on over here, baby. Have a seat.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.782
Get the lady a drink, Jamal.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.617
Yeah, Jamal. This lady's thirsty.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.539
Do you mind
if I ask you a question?

14:33.622 --> 14:36.083
Oh, honey, you can ask me anything.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.879
Did you ever feel unsafe
dating someone in The Life?

14:39.962 --> 14:41.255
No, baby.

14:41.839 --> 14:44.008
Frankie kept me out of all that stuff,

14:44.758 --> 14:46.427
'cause that's what a real man does.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.221
Frankie.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.018
He was the love of my life.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.479
But he couldn't escape who he was.
He was a Santo.

14:57.563 --> 15:02.443
And if you're gonna be with a Santo,
then you gotta take the good with the bad.

15:02.526 --> 15:03.944
And appreciate what you got,

15:04.028 --> 15:07.865
'- cause it can be gone...
- ...just like that.

15:11.493 --> 15:12.912
When Frankie got locked up,

15:13.662 --> 15:15.789
Lil' Ricky made sure I got this.

15:15.873 --> 15:19.460
This was Frankie's high school
championship ring.

15:19.543 --> 15:23.047
Proudest moment in their life
was winning that football game.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.674
Wait, is this all fall down?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.593
All fall down, baby!

15:28.260 --> 15:29.345
We still do that.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.680
So, RollerWorld...

15:32.431 --> 15:36.018
Let's just say there was a third person
and it was Lil' Ricky...

15:36.518 --> 15:40.439
Baby, are you still on that?
I told you he wasn't involved.

15:40.522 --> 15:44.068
Listen, Lil' Ricky was on a higher plane.
Hear?

15:44.777 --> 15:49.323
He was the one that took the Santos
from street hustlers to major players.

15:49.531 --> 15:52.284
- You need a lot of money to do that.
- It was the '80s.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.537
- All you needed was a short stack.
- So maybe someone kept the rest.

15:57.498 --> 15:58.374
Anything's possible.

16:01.460 --> 16:05.631
- You two were the cutest couple.
- Mm-hmm. You got that right.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.385
It ain't gonna refill itself, sweetie.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.978
What's taking Olivia so long?

16:19.061 --> 16:20.396
She's dropping a deuce.

16:20.896 --> 16:21.730
Everybody poops.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.401
- What's wrong with you?
- What's up, locos?

16:25.484 --> 16:27.277
I heard you're from the 'ridge too.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.571
Yo, check it.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.158
Ah! Just clowning!

16:33.242 --> 16:36.745
Yeah, I'm straight from B-Wood. Westside!

16:37.621 --> 16:40.582
So, what do you think of my fits?
And my tat?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.042
It's pretty dope, right?

16:44.211 --> 16:46.088
Moms works in hair and makeup.

16:46.547 --> 16:52.177
I mean, it's like life imitating art
and art imitating life, right?

16:54.346 --> 16:56.056
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.475
- Where'd you get that?
- From the fridge.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.060
That's my mom's pressed juice.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.770
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- She's on a cleanse.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.147
She knows exactly
how many bottles there are.

17:03.230 --> 17:06.316
I had no idea. I just wanted a drink
and I just assumed...

17:06.400 --> 17:08.484
What? That you could just go in
and take it?

17:09.069 --> 17:12.614
There are drinks everywhere.
There's a whole bin of soda right there.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.659
- Why were you in the fridge?
- I was thirsty.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.536
It's just juice. It's not a big deal.

17:17.618 --> 17:20.039
Don't tell me what's not a big deal, okay?

17:20.122 --> 17:22.708
Do people go in your house,
take stuff out of your fridge?

17:22.790 --> 17:23.751
Yeah.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.420
What the hell is wrong with you people?

17:26.502 --> 17:28.380
- You people?
- Hey, just let it go.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.091
- Don't you have any respect?
- Respect?

17:31.467 --> 17:34.219
- Says the white boy dressed like a cholo.
- Excuse me?

17:34.762 --> 17:39.183
You sure you can't stay for the party?
You barely even sampled the goods.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.769
Thanks, Rosé, but we really should
meet up with our friends.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.020
All right.

17:43.562 --> 17:46.190
You be good, hear?

17:46.273 --> 17:47.107
Come here.

17:48.067 --> 17:48.901
Mmm.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.237
Listen, give your guy a chance.

17:52.988 --> 17:55.282
- What guy?
- The one you're in love with.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.703
You'll regret it if you don't. Okay?

18:02.247 --> 18:05.751
Julia! Hey, girl. I'm so glad you made it.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.419
And who do you have with you?

18:07.503 --> 18:09.296
Hope you made enough. We're hungry.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.256
- Come on.
- Come on, babies.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.218
Look at you. I love your costume.

18:14.676 --> 18:16.428
- Come on.
- We got Tootsie Rolls.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.679
I made chili.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.141
Excuse me? Excuse me?

18:21.225 --> 18:22.476
Hey, we don't want any problems.

18:22.559 --> 18:25.145
Exactly. You know, I got her.
Let me pay for the juice.

18:27.106 --> 18:30.692
Okay. Okay, it's 52 dollars a bottle,

18:30.776 --> 18:33.320
and then another 20 each
for all the food and drinks you had.

18:33.403 --> 18:36.073
- We don't have that kind of money on us.
- Of course you don't.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.951
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I'm just stating the obvious.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.160
Now you're just being a dick.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.912
Oh.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.747
Dude, you better control your bitch.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.793
- Dude, he thinks she's my bitch.
- You better apologize.

18:47.876 --> 18:50.629
- No. He doesn't have to apologize.
- Exactly.

18:51.463 --> 18:53.215
So, how are we gonna settle up?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.299
Like this.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.644
So, there was a third guy at RollerWorld.
Lil' Ricky. We need to find him.

19:05.727 --> 19:08.480
Do you think it was little with
an apostrophe or little like Lil Wayne

19:08.564 --> 19:10.482
or little like Little Women?

19:10.566 --> 19:11.483
- Run!
- I don't know.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.026
- Get out of here!
- Run!

19:13.110 --> 19:14.027
- Run!
- Run?

19:14.111 --> 19:15.028
- Why?
- Why?

19:15.654 --> 19:17.072
Ah! Ah!

19:18.866 --> 19:21.285
Run! Run!

19:21.368 --> 19:24.121
Get out of here!
Back to where you came from!

19:24.204 --> 19:25.622
Yeah! And don't come back.

19:29.710 --> 19:33.172
You guys, this is all my fault.
I let that asshole get the best of me.

19:33.255 --> 19:36.675
Don't apologize. We just got to get home.
Jamal, get a Lyft.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.512
My dad said Lyft was only for emergencies.

19:40.596 --> 19:44.391
Seriously? What exactly
constitutes an emergency?

19:44.474 --> 19:47.728
Don't get a Lyft. It's handled.
It's handled.

19:56.737 --> 19:57.613
You want some more?

19:59.156 --> 20:01.867
Oh, you think you're hard. Okay.

20:02.492 --> 20:03.493
I'm not.

20:04.703 --> 20:05.662
But he is.

20:36.860 --> 20:37.986
This shit's real.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.533
Please. What do you want?

20:50.165 --> 20:51.541
I can't believe Monse went home!

20:51.875 --> 20:54.920
Although she is covered in egg.
But she's missing out on our jackpot.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.421
Hey, I'm gonna bounce.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.339
Later.

20:58.382 --> 21:01.927
Olivia, it's still early.
You up for Nightmare on Elm Street?

21:02.552 --> 21:03.553
- Sure.
- Great.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.597
Gonna take a quick shower
then we can get our scare on.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.316
Cesar.

22:03.030 --> 22:03.989
Thank you.

22:05.824 --> 22:06.742
Good night.

22:07.659 --> 22:10.787
Screw that kid. He was just
some rich asshole showing off.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.497
He's not the problem.

22:27.637 --> 22:30.599
No matter how hard I try,
I can't escape who I am.

22:30.682 --> 22:33.727
Those kids in Brentwood, they don't think
we're people. They think we're costumes.

22:33.810 --> 22:35.604
And I played right into the stereotype.

22:35.687 --> 22:39.399
You're being too hard on yourself.
You stood up for your friends.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.026
For me.

22:42.235 --> 22:43.570
You did the right thing.

22:44.654 --> 22:45.989
It doesn't feel that way.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.827
You did nothing wrong.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.168
I'm sorry.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.232
Hey.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.986
You don't need to apologize.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.240
Let's just, you know, hit reset.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.451
Forget either one of us said anything.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.038
And when you get a sec, call me.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.336
I think I just saw my mom.
