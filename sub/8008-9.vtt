Come on, Simon. It's over.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.755
- (WHIMPERS)
- It's gonna be okay, man.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.256
Nope, nope. This way. This way.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.098
Come on. Let's get you some ice cream.

09:51.341 --> 09:54.140
That's the last time you're
gonna toy with his heart.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.386
(SCOFFS)

09:55.470 --> 09:57.393
If you really cared about him,

09:57.388 --> 10:00.642
Why'd you let him degenerate
into this pathetic clown character?

10:00.892 --> 10:03.145
He used to have more of
a silver-fox thing going on,

10:03.228 --> 10:05.151
with his hair and those cute glasses.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.614
He was happier then, you know.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.650
When he was serving me.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.406
- (SCREAMING)
- (ICE SHATFERS)

10:10.735 --> 10:11.907
Dang, girl.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.535
(SCREAMING)

10:15.990 --> 10:17.663
Ugh! (HISSING)

10:17.784 --> 10:18.910
(GRUNTS)

10:19.536 --> 10:21.914
Open those peepers!

10:21.996 --> 10:23.168
Eat a stake!

10:23.248 --> 10:24.625
(HISSES)

10:26.668 --> 10:27.794
(STRUGGLING) No!

10:27.919 --> 10:28.920
(LAUGHS)

10:28.920 --> 10:30.388
- (WARBLING)
- Ugh.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.675
I don't understand this.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.767
Marceline!

10:36.553 --> 10:37.930
Yeah, you're welcome!

10:41.141 --> 10:42.438
(SPLAT)

10:45.895 --> 10:47.693
(INHALES DEEPLY)

10:48.940 --> 10:50.942
(LAUGHTER ECHOING)

10:54.946 --> 10:56.448
Um... Marceline?

10:56.823 --> 10:58.450
(SIGHS) All right.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.203
I shouldn't have tried to
go it alone with the vamps.

11:01.202 --> 11:04.081
From now on, we'll do this team-up style.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.462
Okay, team. You're still invisible.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.213
Oh! (CHUCKLES) Whoops.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.586
Oh!

11:10.170 --> 11:11.171
Hmm.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.070
This party is so crazy!
