17:54.032 --> 17:57.075
I think it's safe to say,

17:57.118 --> 17:58.398
are far more importantthan any.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.992

20:06.623 --> 20:09.207
So what changed? How does shutti?

20:09.250 --> 20:11.000
Does it matter why?

20:11.044 --> 20:12.752
It looks like Ryder wantsto kee.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.129
What aboutGardener's mother?

20:15.173 --> 20:17.131
Even if it's tangentially rela,

20:17.175 --> 20:18.633
there's a chance other Vipers s

20:18.676 --> 20:20.218
were involved with thedistribut.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.471
She's a shit motherraising a s.

20:23.514 --> 20:26.641
You keep on pursuing this, you'.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.476
The Ravens are under attack,

20:28.519 --> 20:32.021
and we have to be prepared to.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.731
No, there isn't gonna be any r.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.107
Neckbone's notthat easy to find.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.525
Hammond's gonna be chasinghis t.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.027
Like the rest of us.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.103

22:07.035 --> 22:07.950
You're a pain in my ass, you k?

22:07.994 --> 22:11.454

22:16.085 --> 22:18.002
Yeah, that's whatl'm doing her.

22:20.298 --> 22:22.006
Heard what happened to Hammon.

22:22.050 --> 22:24.342
Figure if Neckbone was gonna c,

22:24.385 --> 22:26.719
it'd be me and my family.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.429
You could've called, asshole.

22:28.473 --> 22:31.932
I had to get my ex and my kid.

22:31.976 --> 22:34.018
Right now, they come first.I'm.

22:35.813 --> 22:39.065
So this is yourhalfassed plan?

22:39.108 --> 22:41.692
Wait for him to bust in your ex?

22:41.736 --> 22:43.486
It worked on you, didn't it?

22:43.529 --> 22:46.072
Well, I came alone.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.395
You really think Neckbone'sgonn?

22:58.461 --> 23:00.169
This the place?

23:00.213 --> 23:03.047
Call said he'd bein the third.

23:12.475 --> 23:14.308
And there we go.

23:14.352 --> 23:16.811
Yeah.

23:16.854 --> 23:19.063
Got to give himcredit for this.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.307
No one thought of looking for.

23:25.780 --> 23:26.987
He told me everything.

23:29.700 --> 23:30.991
We never lied to each other.

23:33.788 --> 23:34.995
I mean, he wasdoing it for me.

23:36.457 --> 23:37.998
For our future.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.919
Do you know what yourson's job?

23:41.963 --> 23:45.005
He worked directlywith Mr. Sha.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.424
He was involved with the... wit.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.509
Did he sell it?

23:48.553 --> 23:49.885
He distributed it.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.012
He gave it to a cop named Wint.

23:54.475 --> 23:55.766
Not for himself.

23:55.810 --> 23:58.018
Mr. Shankmantold him to do it.

24:02.608 --> 24:03.983
I'm sorry.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.937
Your text said you gaveNeck my.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.397
When I hit you backabout his re,

24:43.441 --> 24:44.190
you ignored me.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.859
Why?

24:46.903 --> 24:47.401
I was toldto tell you in perso.

24:47.445 --> 24:49.820
Told?

24:49.864 --> 24:50.279
So you've talkedface to face, m?

24:50.323 --> 24:52.031
No, man.

24:52.074 --> 24:54.116
He just called me on my cell.

24:54.160 --> 24:54.950
You're lying. You knowwhere he?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.118
Look at my face, man.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.037
You think I'm tryingto play gam?

24:58.080 --> 25:00.206
Did you tell him what would ha?

25:00.249 --> 25:02.374
About his mom?

25:02.418 --> 25:04.001
Yeah.-And?

25:07.965 --> 25:09.285
He said go aheadand kill the b.

25:20.102 --> 25:22.061
It's worth takinganother look.

25:22.104 --> 25:23.729
Because of whata grieving moth?

25:23.773 --> 25:26.190
She knew Winters was involved.

25:26.234 --> 25:27.252
She was awareof the whole opera?

25:27.276 --> 25:28.943
Winters is dead, how does that h?

25:28.986 --> 25:30.528
There's more to thisthan Shank.

25:30.571 --> 25:31.820
My gut tells me he's involved.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.008
It's a dead end, Damon. He's a,

25:33.032 --> 25:35.491
but the man's been nothing but.

25:35.535 --> 25:36.951
I think if we just...

25:36.994 --> 25:38.786
Stay focused onwhat's in front,

25:38.829 --> 25:40.069
instead of thisBig Pharma shit.

25:40.456 --> 25:41.997
That's an order.

25:44.669 --> 25:46.877
You know what? Forget it.

25:46.921 --> 25:48.201
If you can't get thisRaven thin.

25:49.298 --> 25:50.298
I will.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.023
What?

26:08.067 --> 26:11.277
?Got some i.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.548
Yeah, I'm not in the moodfor y.

26:12.572 --> 26:13.988
No, this ain't about us.

26:14.031 --> 26:16.031
When Neckbonestarted killing co.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.495
What's the news?

26:21.539 --> 26:22.997
Got a lead on Neck.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.337
How?

26:30.381 --> 26:31.672
I've got ears on the street.

26:31.716 --> 26:34.133
Let's just leave it at that.

26:34.176 --> 26:35.456
Thought you should bethe one to.

26:51.986 --> 26:52.986
What are you?

27:27.188 --> 27:28.979
Hi.

27:32.526 --> 27:33.984
You need something?

27:35.738 --> 27:37.071
Frank told me what happened.

27:37.114 --> 27:38.258
I just wanted to make sure that.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.282
Okay.

27:41.327 --> 27:44.078
I'm okay.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.579
Sorry, I didn't meanto intrude.

27:45.623 --> 27:46.623
So, what are you after?

27:51.462 --> 27:52.252
I ran a background check on you.

27:52.296 --> 27:53.545
You ran a background check...

27:53.589 --> 27:55.506
Name, date of birth.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.633
It's all fake. Why?

27:57.677 --> 27:59.093
Why did you runa background ch?

27:59.136 --> 28:02.054
Are you kidding me?-Katherine A.

28:07.770 --> 28:08.930
I got somewhere I need to be.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.440
Shit.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.124
Sanders says this slip has bd

28:30.167 --> 28:31.367

Wait, wait!

30:53.060 --> 30:54.380
You see what they're doing her?

30:55.646 --> 30:56.979
Berserkers set us up, man.

31:21.589 --> 31:22.589
Tom Hammond.

31:24.592 --> 31:26.425

32:14.016 --> 32:15.599
This is your one shot to keep f

32:15.643 --> 32:16.763
and your sons out of prison.

32:19.730 --> 32:20.979
Be smart for once in your life.

33:04.233 --> 33:05.233
Shit.

You know who that belonged to,

33:08.862 --> 33:10.404
and what it means thatit was in.

33:10.447 --> 33:11.738
Tell Neckbone...

33:11.782 --> 33:15.909
Sleep died like a little bitch.

33:15.953 --> 33:17.995
If he wants revenge, come and.

33:33.470 --> 33:34.470
He's not coming.

33:35.556 --> 33:39.182
We don't know that.

33:39.226 --> 33:41.601
Or maybe we haveoverestimated,

33:41.645 --> 33:42.925
and nobody reallycares about yo.

33:44.273 --> 33:45.564
You do.

33:45.607 --> 33:46.982
Or you wouldn't be here.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.361
I used to.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.061
I think you're probably right.

33:55.492 --> 33:56.492
He ain't coming...

33:57.578 --> 33:58.994
at least not tonight.

34:09.255 --> 34:10.255
Shit.

34:19.433 --> 34:21.016
What's that?

34:22.603 --> 34:24.018
This is my insurance policy.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.982
Winters was paranoid as shit.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.306
She kept dirt on everyoneshe wo.

34:31.862 --> 34:33.101
When she went missing, I took.

What's on it?

34:37.326 --> 34:38.992

35:07.648 --> 35:09.856
It's making a fresh start.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.180
