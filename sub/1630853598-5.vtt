13:35.731 --> 13:38.734
I used to think he could survive anything,
and now he's dead.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.028
I'm really, really sorry.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.323
[crying and sniffling]

13:46.534 --> 13:47.535
Me too, kid.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.205
[Diego] Come on and help me
wrap up your uncle in the carpet.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.290
I know you.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.750
[woman] Of course you do.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.585
I'm your mother.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.711
'Course.

13:58.462 --> 13:59.880
Is that menudo?

13:59.964 --> 14:01.090
Yes.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.424
Good stuff.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.009
Mmm…

14:04.927 --> 14:07.054
Mmm. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

14:08.764 --> 14:09.974
[laughs]

14:11.392 --> 14:12.643
Mmm!

14:14.019 --> 14:17.982
So how can you be my mom
if you died before I was born?

14:18.065 --> 14:21.485
How have you died 56 times
and come back to life?

14:21.569 --> 14:24.572
That's a trick question 'cause
I didn't know that I was doing that.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.365
Well, what did you think you were doing?

14:26.448 --> 14:31.620
I just thought I was one of those
lovable rascally Looney Tunes characters.

14:31.704 --> 14:35.374
Hit me on the head with a hammer,
and I see some cartoon birds.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.502
And then, pop! I get back up.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.296
Uh…

14:40.796 --> 14:42.631
What's a "cartoon"?

14:42.715 --> 14:44.633
Oh, seriously? You're so Amish.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.551
-Oh!
-You're so--

14:45.634 --> 14:47.887
I'm kidding. [laughs]

14:47.970 --> 14:49.513
We have all the channels here.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.141
But mostly, I watch you.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.102
Even the naughty bits?

14:55.769 --> 14:58.606
I've seen you mourning me,
and you don't need to.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.400
I'm… I'm at peace.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.319
Bah!

15:03.402 --> 15:04.528
Peace is overrated.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.363
And chaos is exhausting.

15:06.447 --> 15:09.575
Only for amateurs.
I'm a professional, Mom.

15:11.619 --> 15:15.414
So just tell me, okay?
Tell me who it was who killed you.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.499
-You're not looking for vengeance.
-I'm not--

15:17.583 --> 15:19.710
You're looking for purpose.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.837
And I can't give you that.

15:21.921 --> 15:22.922
No one can.

15:23.005 --> 15:23.881
Are you sure?

15:23.964 --> 15:25.925
I know I'm new to this whole mom thing,

15:26.008 --> 15:29.470
but aren't you supposed to help me,
your son?

15:29.553 --> 15:31.472
-What's so funny?
-You.

15:31.555 --> 15:34.141
All this time and energy

15:34.224 --> 15:37.519
running away
from the exact thing you're chasing.

15:38.103 --> 15:43.067
No wonder you can't see
what's right in front of you all along.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.625
[light jazz music playing]

16:03.420 --> 16:05.839
So this Kugelblitz, it's…?

16:06.882 --> 16:08.133
The end of everything.

16:08.217 --> 16:12.596
Every rock, every star, every atom
sucked into a radiant black hole.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.557
Randomly collapsing matter
every moment in time

16:15.641 --> 16:17.935
across all existence till nothing's left.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.520
Hate to say I told you so, but…

16:19.603 --> 16:21.397
You love to say I told you so.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.531
[Lila] You know, it's impressive.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.492
Whoever knocked off your mums
hated you all enough

16:33.575 --> 16:34.952
to end the entire universe.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.370
We don't know that.

16:37.037 --> 16:39.915
It doesn't matter who created the thing.
We just have to kick its ass.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.125
Oh really? How?

16:41.208 --> 16:44.128
Are you and Diego
gonna punch it in the Kugel?

16:44.211 --> 16:47.506
The best plan is to go back in time
and eliminate the paradox

16:47.589 --> 16:50.384
and destroy whatever it was
that took out our mothers

16:50.467 --> 16:53.804
and stop the Kugelblitz before it starts,
but we can't do that.

16:53.887 --> 16:55.014
Briefcase is kaput.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.183
And why the hell
can't you just jump us out of here?

16:58.267 --> 17:00.686
Last time I tried that,
we all got trapped in time.

17:00.769 --> 17:02.354
Do you really wanna risk that again?

17:03.939 --> 17:04.982
What's plan B?

17:09.111 --> 17:10.320
[Diego grunts]

17:11.530 --> 17:13.657
Are you sure
we can't just torch the evidence?

17:13.741 --> 17:16.326
A couple flames from Mr. Burns over here.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.786
Give me that, you little pyro.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.079
We're not burning anything.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.623
We're gonna go talk
to the family together.

17:22.332 --> 17:26.003
They'll, uh, understand
that this was an accident.

17:27.504 --> 17:29.590
Hey. No matter what happens,

17:30.674 --> 17:31.967
I got your back, okay?

17:34.261 --> 17:35.554
Tú ya eres mi sangre.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.931
I still don't speak Spanish.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.977
And I accept your flaws, all right?

17:42.561 --> 17:43.604
Now… [grunts]

17:43.687 --> 17:44.772
[bell dings]

17:45.439 --> 17:47.441
[Diego] I got it, I got it.
Just go get the door.

17:47.524 --> 17:48.358
[Stan] No, let me--

17:48.442 --> 17:50.444
-No. Go wait over there. Wait by the…
-Okay.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.118
Uh… yeah, we're, uh,

17:58.202 --> 17:59.411
playing a game.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.330
What's it called?

18:01.413 --> 18:02.539
Guy in a Carpet.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.501
I hope you win.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.338
-Go get the door.
-Okay.

18:09.963 --> 18:11.048
[grunts]

18:11.131 --> 18:12.966
[sighs] Klaus was right.

18:14.301 --> 18:15.469
I love this place.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.014
[strains] Okay.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.184
-Get his head, get his head.
-Yeah, I got it. I got it.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.061
-Oh, that's heavy.
-[Diego] Press the button.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.020
Okay.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.107
-Ground, ground. G. There you go.
-Yeah. Okay.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.695
[elevator whirring]

18:39.952 --> 18:41.829
-[gasps]
-[Diego and Stan scream]

18:41.912 --> 18:43.413
-[Klaus screams]
-Oh my God!

18:43.997 --> 18:45.791
You told me he was dead, puta!

18:45.874 --> 18:47.918
He was, and now you speak Spanish?

18:48.001 --> 18:49.419
[Klaus grunts]

18:49.503 --> 18:53.757
Let's just turn down
the volume a smidge, shall we?

18:53.841 --> 18:56.718
Celestial comedown is a bitch!

18:56.802 --> 18:57.678
[Diego grunts]

18:58.262 --> 18:59.388
[Diego] Whoa!

19:00.848 --> 19:01.890
[elevator whirring]

19:01.974 --> 19:05.727
Oh, you scared the shit out of me, Klaus!
I thought you were dead.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.355
Yeah. [breathing rapidly]

19:08.438 --> 19:09.565
Me too.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.026
[laughing maniacally]

19:14.444 --> 19:16.071
[weeping]

19:17.322 --> 19:19.783
Me too. Me too.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.496
-[sighs]
-[bell dings]

19:28.417 --> 19:31.170
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dude. Dude, slow down.

19:31.253 --> 19:34.423
You were dead, like, three minutes ago.
Like dead dead, all right, so--

19:34.506 --> 19:35.674
Well, I'm back now.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.552
Apparently, it's, like, a thing I do.
Who knew, right?

19:38.635 --> 19:39.720
And look, look, look.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.765
[Klaus] It's… It's already healing.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.894
What would happen if we cut off your head?
Would it grow two of you?

19:46.977 --> 19:48.061
Stan.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.104
Would it?

19:49.813 --> 19:51.106
[Klaus sighs]

19:59.323 --> 20:00.949
-[Klaus] Gimme that.
-What happened to you?

20:01.033 --> 20:04.745
Oh, just a speargun to the chest.
No big deal.

20:04.828 --> 20:05.871
What did we miss?

20:07.080 --> 20:10.083
The universe is ending,
and we're all going to die.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.256
[Grace] Why have you brought me
before my God?

20:16.340 --> 20:18.425
-Your right eye. Give it to me.
-What are you doing?

20:18.508 --> 20:21.345
If we wanna beat this thing,
first we need to understand it.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.688
[Ben] It's time to see
what's on the other side.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.900
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

20:46.870 --> 20:48.497
[energy pulses]

20:50.332 --> 20:52.209
-[Fei] Whoa!
-[Ben] Fei, watch it! Grab her!

21:13.063 --> 21:14.064
[muffled scream]

21:16.108 --> 21:17.359
[Diego] What the hell was that?

21:18.068 --> 21:19.903
[Five] That was a Kugel wave.

21:19.987 --> 21:23.323
-[Five] Oh, it's getting worse.
-[Luther] How long do we have?

21:23.407 --> 21:25.492
At this rate of escalation,
if you factor in--

21:25.575 --> 21:27.077
How long, Five?

21:28.412 --> 21:31.456
Four, maybe five days
before the rest of existence is blitzed.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.750
[Five sighs]

21:37.796 --> 21:41.008
[breathing rapidly]

21:46.013 --> 21:48.348
[Fei] Come on, Ben! [straining]

21:50.517 --> 21:53.395
-[Fei] I'm telling you, it won't work!
-[Ben] Hold on, Fei!

21:53.478 --> 21:55.689
[circuits warbling]

21:56.523 --> 21:59.276
[Fei and Ben panting]

22:00.110 --> 22:02.112
[Grace] God has a million eyes,

22:03.155 --> 22:05.574
each falling into themselves.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.743
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

22:07.826 --> 22:08.910
[Christopher speaks]

22:08.994 --> 22:11.455
Oh, black holes? Really?

22:11.955 --> 22:13.999
Am I just surrounded by morons?

22:14.082 --> 22:15.167
Maybe he's right.

22:15.250 --> 22:19.296
What if what Grace is describing
is a black hole collapsing in on itself?

22:19.379 --> 22:20.589
Oh, whatever.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.257
[energy pulsing]

22:22.841 --> 22:24.343
God is angry with us.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.136
[Fei] We are wasting precious time.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.597
This is bigger than just us. We need help.

22:28.680 --> 22:32.225
Harlan first, then we can kill
whatever the hell this is.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.311
-[Luther] We should've given them Harlan.
-Luther.

22:34.394 --> 22:35.520
What about Harlan?

22:37.189 --> 22:40.192
The Sparrows said if we turned him over,
we could end the fighting,

22:40.275 --> 22:42.361
and then work together to save the world.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.487
But if we didn't--

22:43.570 --> 22:45.238
But we tried to make peace.

22:45.322 --> 22:48.867
Okay, and then the step-siblings from hell
attacked, kidnapped you,

22:48.950 --> 22:51.078
and they tried to kill us.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.205
I mean, come on. We can't trust them.

22:53.288 --> 22:57.709
Working together would be like trying
to defuse a bomb by pouring gas on it.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.628
It's only gonna make things
burn down faster.

22:59.711 --> 23:04.383
But don't we need the big bad glow-y thing
in their basement?

23:06.760 --> 23:08.678
Klaus, do you know
where the Kugelblitz is?

23:08.762 --> 23:10.555
Oh, yeah. I saw it. [dramatic gasp]

23:10.639 --> 23:11.723
When I went to visit Dad.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.976
It's in the old storage room
where Mom used to keep all her luggage.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.896
-Why didn't you tell anyone?
-I did. I told you!

23:18.480 --> 23:20.107
You say stupid shit all the time!

23:20.190 --> 23:22.067
Of course.
It appeared in the same place we did.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.318
…important stupid shit.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.903
[Klaus] That's not your fault?

23:24.986 --> 23:28.657
I'm inside your brain,
pulling levers and stuff? Serious…

23:28.740 --> 23:32.828
-[Five] You don't think the Kugelblitz…
-[conversation fades out]

23:34.329 --> 23:35.247
Hey.

23:35.872 --> 23:39.626
Why are you protecting this guy, huh?
It's like Peabody all over again.

23:39.709 --> 23:41.128
Harlan is nothing like Leonard.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.964
Well, he's clearly got
some kinda hold over you.

23:45.006 --> 23:47.134
-Stop covering for him.
-[Five] Covering what?

23:50.178 --> 23:51.179
[Five] What's going on?

23:55.267 --> 23:58.228
-He didn't mean to hurt anyone.
-Really? You mean, when he did this?

23:58.311 --> 24:00.689
-[Stan winces] Ow!
-Wait, Harlan did that?

24:00.772 --> 24:01.898
That's it, I'm gonna end him.

24:01.982 --> 24:04.776
Look, I know how it looks,
but Harlan didn't ask for this.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.821
If we hadn't gone back to 1963,
if I hadn't have saved him--

24:07.904 --> 24:10.031
He killed Jayme and Alphonso, not you.

24:10.115 --> 24:13.326
He's the reason we're in this mess,
and he's our only way out of it.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.661
[Five] Luther's right.

24:14.744 --> 24:18.331
If we're gonna have an iota of a chance
of getting out of this alive,

24:18.415 --> 24:19.916
we need access to the Kugelblitz.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.461
There's only four of them left.
We can just overpower them.

24:22.544 --> 24:25.464
What, and risk losing
some of us in the process?

24:25.547 --> 24:26.965
Harlan is insignificant.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.676
You told me once
that no one is insignificant.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.348
They'll kill him.

24:37.934 --> 24:39.769
[Lila] Uh, so?

24:39.853 --> 24:43.857
We are talking about one person
versus saving billions of lives here.

24:43.940 --> 24:46.193
I mean, is this really
a debate for you people?

24:46.276 --> 24:47.986
Hey, Little Britain? You don't get a vote.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.988
Lila lives in this universe too.

24:50.071 --> 24:53.325
Besides, she's family now. Kinda, sorta.

24:53.408 --> 24:54.534
Mm. Thanks, kitten.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.495
I don't give a shit about the Sparrows,

24:56.578 --> 24:59.581
but I'm not gonna let
scary-ass Grandpa finish you off.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.167
Five days ago, he was just a little kid.

25:03.210 --> 25:06.630
And what? Now I'm supposed to just
decide whether he lives or dies?

25:07.797 --> 25:10.926
Viktor, we're down
to ethical triage here, all right?

25:11.009 --> 25:12.552
We can't save everyone.

25:15.597 --> 25:17.474
The kindest cut wins.

25:20.101 --> 25:22.270
You always wanted to be on the team.

25:24.022 --> 25:25.607
[Luther] This is what it is.

25:26.441 --> 25:29.569
Saving the world
means making the hard calls.

25:33.865 --> 25:34.908
I hate this.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.035
Yeah, I know.

25:41.122 --> 25:42.165
I'll go get him.

25:46.294 --> 25:47.295
Wait, no.

25:49.839 --> 25:50.799
Let me do it.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.009
[Viktor] He trusts me.

25:53.093 --> 25:56.221
I can convince him to come quietly.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.443
[sighs]

26:11.903 --> 26:13.405
What are you listening to?

26:18.493 --> 26:19.494
Wind.

26:21.371 --> 26:24.958
The sound it makes
blowing through a field of corn.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.961
Tractor half a mile away.

26:28.044 --> 26:29.129
And horses.

26:29.212 --> 26:31.840
Mustangs mostly. One palomino.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.635
It sounds like…

26:35.719 --> 26:36.928
Home.

26:37.554 --> 26:38.430
Yeah.

26:38.513 --> 26:39.639
Yeah, I remember.

26:41.391 --> 26:44.269
What do you think would have happened
if I had stayed?

26:45.770 --> 26:47.105
We'd have been happy.

26:50.483 --> 26:52.819
Or maybe I still would've ruined
everything for her.

26:52.902 --> 26:56.114
Hey. I know the little boy
you were, Harlan.

26:56.197 --> 26:57.449
You didn't ruin anything.

26:57.532 --> 26:59.326
Then why are you giving up on me?

27:03.038 --> 27:04.414
I can feel it.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.709
I can't hide anything from you, can I?

27:08.293 --> 27:09.419
That's our curse.

27:10.253 --> 27:12.922
I'm sorry I couldn't fix things.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.716
I tried.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.593
But we never tried together.

27:18.845 --> 27:21.181
I bet we could get it right this time.

27:25.393 --> 27:26.811
There's still time.

27:31.066 --> 27:34.694
You are obviously grounded,
at least through to the end of the world.

27:34.778 --> 27:37.155
Yeah, and you better recognize
how lucky you are.

27:37.238 --> 27:38.531
You know how many kids would wish

27:38.615 --> 27:40.367
their cool dead uncle
would come back to life?

27:40.450 --> 27:41.826
-That's a bit random.
-Not helping.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.412
-Okay.
-This thing won't budge.

27:45.580 --> 27:46.998
-Together on three.
-Okay.

27:47.582 --> 27:50.043
One, two, three.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.505
-Looks as good as new.
-[Stan] All right.

27:53.588 --> 27:57.676
Hey. Now you are gonna take all this
back to where you got it.

27:57.759 --> 28:01.346
And next time you steal,
I expect it to be something valuable.

28:01.429 --> 28:02.263
Okay.

28:02.347 --> 28:04.474
Honestly, we need
to set higher expectations.

28:06.309 --> 28:08.311
-[Stan laughs]
-Here.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.938
You're gonna make me drop them.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.940
Oh, no, that's a you problem, man.

28:12.649 --> 28:13.566
Come on.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.026
-Add it on.
-No! [laughs]

28:15.527 --> 28:17.362
-Here, don't forget the big one.
-[Stan laughs]

28:17.445 --> 28:18.571
That's enough, boys.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.867
[whistles] Stan.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.829
Ear medicine, downstairs.
Don't forget to take it, okay?

28:25.912 --> 28:26.913
Okay.

28:28.373 --> 28:31.126
You know, you're a less terrible father
than I thought you'd be.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.836
Yeah, I think I'm winning him over.

28:33.336 --> 28:35.380
I think all you gotta do
is show a little bit of--

28:42.804 --> 28:44.013
Wait, what was that?

28:45.306 --> 28:49.894
I dunno. Sexy dad is kind of a turn-on.
Plus, it's the end of the world.

28:49.978 --> 28:54.566
Oh, okay. Well, I thought you already
moved on to, like, many, many men.

28:54.649 --> 28:55.483
So?

28:56.067 --> 28:57.318
So I need to be wooed.

28:57.402 --> 28:58.737
-You need to be wooed.
-Wooed.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.156
-Ooh.
-Yeah, flowers.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.365
An expensive bottle of wine.

29:02.449 --> 29:05.285
Or I could find another DILF
to play Daddy.

29:08.288 --> 29:09.372
I'm the daddy here.

29:09.456 --> 29:10.498
Yeah, you are.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.433
[pool balls clattering]

29:36.483 --> 29:37.484
Hey.

29:41.112 --> 29:42.113
So, um…

29:43.782 --> 29:45.450
should I be worried about you?

29:45.533 --> 29:46.659
[soft chuckle]

29:46.743 --> 29:47.660
Me?

29:48.161 --> 29:49.537
[blows a raspberry]

29:50.872 --> 29:53.166
Better than ever. Just ask Diego.

29:53.249 --> 29:54.292
Ah, yes.

29:55.043 --> 29:58.505
See now, you hanging out with Diego
is how I know something's wrong.

29:58.588 --> 30:00.006
[Allison] Hmm. [chuckles]

30:03.593 --> 30:04.886
I know you, Allison.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.098
And I know when you're drowning.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.272
It's happening again, isn't it?

30:17.941 --> 30:21.110
-Everything's ending.
-Yeah, we'll figure that out.

30:21.945 --> 30:24.614
[both laughing]

30:25.198 --> 30:26.199
Yeah.

30:29.410 --> 30:30.411
Or we won't.

30:31.454 --> 30:32.914
Or we will,

30:32.997 --> 30:34.916
but it won't matter

30:34.999 --> 30:37.961
because the new timeline
will be even worse for me.

30:41.965 --> 30:42.882
[Luther exhales]

30:42.966 --> 30:44.384
I can't keep doing this.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.763
I can't keep losing people. It's not fair.

30:53.810 --> 30:54.894
Hey.

30:56.145 --> 30:57.230
Hey, come here.

Uh…

31:26.134 --> 31:27.468
I thought you, um…

31:28.511 --> 31:30.263
No. I mean, I used to--

31:30.346 --> 31:31.931
-I just can't.
-Oh God.

31:33.391 --> 31:34.350
I can't, uh…

31:36.269 --> 31:37.687
It's okay. I just, um…

31:38.271 --> 31:41.232
I just said I'd go see Sloane,
so I'm gonna…

31:42.317 --> 31:43.651
I'm just gonna go.

31:43.735 --> 31:44.694
Wow.

31:44.777 --> 31:45.820
[Allison scoffs]

31:45.904 --> 31:47.280
You can't be serious.

31:50.533 --> 31:54.412
You're blowing me off for some knockoff
you've known for five minutes?

31:55.705 --> 31:57.040
What do you even want from me?

31:57.123 --> 31:59.500
-[scoffs]
-No, come on, be honest.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.003
If you had Ray and Claire back,
would you even be here?

32:02.086 --> 32:03.796
But they're not back, are they?

32:03.880 --> 32:06.799
I get that you need a distraction,
but you can't use me for that.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.384
I can if I want to.

32:10.470 --> 32:11.596
[soft chuckle]

32:13.264 --> 32:14.349
That's not funny.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.397
I heard a rumor you stay. [voice echoes]

32:34.911 --> 32:35.787
Allison…

32:35.870 --> 32:39.916
I'm done letting other people decide
how much I can stand to lose.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.417
Allison, please.

32:43.002 --> 32:43.836
Don't do this.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.965
I heard a rumor you want me.
[voice echoes]

32:54.889 --> 32:58.851
[emotional music swells]

33:13.366 --> 33:14.200
[Luther grunts]

33:15.535 --> 33:16.786
[Allison whimpers]

33:21.666 --> 33:23.126
Stop. Stop.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.211
Please stop.

33:26.546 --> 33:27.380
Stop!

33:27.463 --> 33:28.756

33:46.065 --> 33:47.442
[Viktor] Oh, are you okay?

33:47.525 --> 33:48.526
I'm fine, um…

33:50.028 --> 33:51.904
Are you sneaking him out?

33:51.988 --> 33:53.156
I have to.

33:53.239 --> 33:55.992
The whole family voted
to hand him over to the Sparrows.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.286
There's still a chance.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.872
I can save him.
I can take back his powers.

34:00.955 --> 34:02.165
Get him out of town.

34:03.332 --> 34:04.292
Yeah, and then what?

34:04.375 --> 34:07.587
Then I can focus on the Sparrows
and the Kugel-whatever.

34:07.670 --> 34:10.298
-Yeah, that's a really bad idea--
-Look, I owe him this.

34:11.215 --> 34:14.469
What if we fix the Kugel,
and I don't make it?

34:15.386 --> 34:17.346
And he's just stuck like this?

34:18.931 --> 34:20.183
Allison, please.

34:20.266 --> 34:21.267
Please, you…

34:22.268 --> 34:23.394
You didn't see us.

34:24.479 --> 34:25.396
[sighs]

34:25.480 --> 34:29.817
Look, I will take him somewhere safe.
But, Viktor, you have to tell them.

34:32.695 --> 34:34.447
You don't have to do this.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.618
You'd do it for me, right?

34:43.081 --> 34:45.917
Okay. Harlan, you're gonna go
with Allison for a bit.

34:46.959 --> 34:48.127
What about you?

34:48.211 --> 34:50.963
I'll join you as soon as I can. I promise.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.008
Okay, go.

35:11.567 --> 35:12.527
[Five] Hey.

35:13.236 --> 35:14.612
It's time.

35:15.655 --> 35:16.697
Where's Harlan?

35:18.074 --> 35:20.451
-He's gone.
-You let him go, didn't you?

35:21.035 --> 35:23.121
Harlan's death
is not gonna stop the Kugelblitz.

35:23.204 --> 35:25.998
It's just gonna be another
tragedy on a tragedy,

35:26.082 --> 35:27.542
and we can find another…

35:27.625 --> 35:28.960
I will find another way.

35:29.627 --> 35:32.171
Well, congratulations, Viktor. [chuckles]

35:32.255 --> 35:34.257
You managed to destroy everything.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.349

you were smarter than that.

-There.
-Thanks.

36:05.496 --> 36:07.456
I saw my future self die.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.083
[gasps] That's crazy.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.960
Almost the exact same thing
happened to me.

36:11.043 --> 36:14.213
-But I didn't die, but I did, but…
-He told me not to save the world.

36:14.297 --> 36:15.673
-And then he died.
-I don't know.

36:15.756 --> 36:18.384
-What do you think he meant by that?
-Well, shouldn't you know?

36:18.467 --> 36:20.887
Shouldn't you know about your-- Okay.

36:20.970 --> 36:22.847
-Well, up your ass.
-Salut.

36:26.058 --> 36:30.104
Klaus, I've dedicated my entire life
to stopping the apocalypse.

36:30.771 --> 36:31.981

36:32.773 --> 36:35.735
-And he tells me…
-Mm-hmm?

36:35.818 --> 36:38.196
That it's… it's, what? It's meaningless?

36:38.279 --> 36:40.198
Oh, well, I don't know anything--

36:40.281 --> 36:42.950
Maybe that's his way of saying
not to become him, but…

36:43.826 --> 36:44.911
[Five sighs]

36:44.994 --> 36:48.539
Oh, you're really
messed up about this, huh?

36:49.665 --> 36:50.958
[sighs]

36:51.459 --> 36:52.960
I've cheated time so much,

36:53.044 --> 36:56.589
I guess I just figured
I'd somehow cheat death.

36:57.089 --> 37:00.468
But it turns out,
I die a one-armed nightmare

37:00.551 --> 37:03.471

end up like this guy,

37:17.985 --> 37:20.446
why don't you just do something
completely different?

37:20.529 --> 37:23.741
Completely different--
Move upstate, become an alpaca farmer.

37:23.824 --> 37:25.201
Yeah, I could.

37:25.284 --> 37:27.912
The timeline's malleable.
We've proven that much.

37:27.995 --> 37:29.914
I could try and break the cycle, but--

37:29.997 --> 37:30.998
Yeah, sure.

37:31.082 --> 37:34.252
Just keep your arms and extremities away
from sharp objects,

-What?
-The tattoo.

It's the symbol of the biker gang,
the Mothers of Agony.

37:41.175 --> 37:42.218
You know them?
