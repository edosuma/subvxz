00:16.490 --> 00:19.902
<i>War creates opportunities
for the criminal underworld.</i>

00:20.070 --> 00:23.035
<i>Ruthless mercenaries conspire
with the separatists</i>

00:23.160 --> 00:26.622
<i>To disrupt and exploit the unstable
situation within the Republic.</i>

00:27.330 --> 00:29.704
<i>Now Anakin Skywalker and ahsoka tano</i>

00:29.987 --> 00:32.415
<i>Descend into the treacherous
gangster havens</i>

00:32.683 --> 00:35.243
<i>In an effort to find a corrupt
and vile arms dealer</i>

00:35.368 --> 00:37.485
<i>Who is buying weapons
on the black market.</i>

00:37.610 --> 00:39.988
<i>And selling them
to the Republic's enemies.</i>

00:54.521 --> 00:58.525
Car Affa is an arms dealer selling
Republic weapons on the black market.

00:58.710 --> 01:01.068
- Who is he selling them to?
- The separatists.

01:01.855 --> 01:04.614
According to intelligence,
he's inside this joint.

01:04.884 --> 01:07.529
You stay here in
case he tries to escape.

01:08.452 --> 01:10.328
Just like always.

01:31.809 --> 01:33.017
My lightsaber.

01:41.983 --> 01:44.162
My master's gonna kill me.

01:51.686 --> 01:53.277
This isn't happening.

01:56.542 --> 02:00.378
- Where were you?
- I... i was checking out a suspect.

02:00.503 --> 02:02.797
I had a bad feeling about him.

02:02.965 --> 02:04.898
- And?
- It was nothing.

02:05.324 --> 02:07.589
- False alarm.
- Come on, then.

02:23.667 --> 02:24.527
Master?

02:26.030 --> 02:29.073
Is it all right if i go to the library,
and do some research?

02:29.513 --> 02:32.311
Sure. I'll take care of
our little friend here.

02:37.589 --> 02:40.782
I'm sure if you explain your loss to your master,

02:40.907 --> 02:42.575
He'll understand.

02:42.838 --> 02:43.470
No.

02:44.220 --> 02:47.980
He tells me over and over,
"your lightsaber is your life...

02:48.305 --> 02:49.802
Don't lose it."

02:50.565 --> 02:53.389
Ugh, there has to be a better way to find this thief.

02:53.757 --> 02:57.730
I'm sorry. Pickpockets aren't
my field of expertise.

02:58.207 --> 03:00.710
At this rate, it'll take me years to find him.

03:00.835 --> 03:02.818
I might have another idea.

03:03.567 --> 03:04.426
There.

03:04.902 --> 03:06.666
That is Tera Sinube.

03:07.214 --> 03:08.987
He's an elder Jedi.

03:09.740 --> 03:14.123
He happens to be an expert
on the coruscant crime world.

03:14.123 --> 03:14.158
I think he's sleeping.
Yes.

03:14.248 --> 03:16.849
- I think he's sleeping.
- Yes.

03:17.518 --> 03:20.194
Well, he will be able to help you.

03:21.913 --> 03:23.839
Pardon me, master Sinube.

03:24.427 --> 03:25.572
What? Who?

03:27.294 --> 03:29.707
I was just resting my eyes.

03:31.166 --> 03:33.011
Hello, master Sinube.

03:33.958 --> 03:35.631
Good morning, Jocasta.

03:37.313 --> 03:39.411
I don't know you, do I?

03:40.062 --> 03:43.333
My name is Ahsoka Tano.
I was told you could help me.

03:43.881 --> 03:44.870
Help you ?

03:45.569 --> 03:47.961
I'll leave you two
to your business.

03:48.086 --> 03:51.823
A thief stole my lightsaber, and
I only got a quick look at him.

03:51.948 --> 03:54.901
I could tell he definitely came 
from one of the aquatic planets,

03:55.026 --> 03:57.090
You know, one of the water worlds?

03:57.215 --> 04:01.235
You're saying there was something fishy about him?

04:06.713 --> 04:09.703
Well, let's try and
see if we can find out

04:09.956 --> 04:11.943
Where he went, shall we?

04:12.571 --> 04:15.217
We were near the slum district, G17.

04:16.046 --> 04:19.392
Where would he go,
your little pickpocket?

04:20.362 --> 04:24.234
To a gangster hangout?
Unlikely but possible.

04:24.589 --> 04:28.244
Maybe the gun market to
sell the lightsaber,

04:28.467 --> 04:30.007
Within the radius.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.338
Just a moment.
Let me see.

04:32.752 --> 04:35.752
He was a patrolian.
That's a fish guy.

04:36.249 --> 04:37.181
Maybe...

04:38.607 --> 04:41.956
- is it one these fishes?
- That's him!

04:42.246 --> 04:46.016
Interesting indeed.
According to the file,

04:46.141 --> 04:49.053
His name is Bannamu, a petty thief.

04:49.178 --> 04:51.215
He hangs out in the slum district.

04:51.340 --> 04:53.492
- Thank you, master Sinube.
- I'm sure i--

04:53.617 --> 04:56.249
- Your help has been invaluable.
- You're welcome.

04:56.374 --> 04:58.802
- If there's anything I can do--
- Yes, there is.

04:59.187 --> 05:01.717
I haven't been on assignment in years.

05:02.670 --> 05:07.440
And if you don't slow down,
you're not going to find what you're...

05:07.565 --> 05:09.856
looking for.
I'll come with you.

05:10.956 --> 05:12.618
Okay, gramps.

05:13.013 --> 05:16.378
- It would be nice to have company.
- Splendid.

05:32.354 --> 05:37.736
- Can I help you?
- We're looking to buy a lightsaber.

05:37.861 --> 05:41.627
- Any ideas where we could do that?
- Come with me.

05:51.626 --> 05:53.653
You want to buy a lightsaber?

05:53.778 --> 05:55.721
How much are willing to pay?

05:56.156 --> 05:58.469
If you have it, you'll give it to me.

05:58.748 --> 06:02.703
What my little friend
is saying is, how much?

06:02.828 --> 06:06.207
- 20,000.
- 20,000?

06:06.332 --> 06:08.993
It's a rare weapon, a Jedi weapon.

06:10.139 --> 06:15.382
- Do you have the item with you?
- No. But I can get it.

06:15.636 --> 06:19.042
- From him?
- Hey, who are these guys?

06:20.055 --> 06:23.420
- Ah, they are Jedi.
- And if we are?

06:23.892 --> 06:26.061
I don't want to get
mixed up with Jedi.

06:26.325 --> 06:29.146
We were just doing our
old friend Bannamu a favor.

06:29.517 --> 06:33.034
I think it's time you forget
about him and do me a favor.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.191
That's my lightsaber he stole.

06:35.445 --> 06:37.553
Oh, well, uh,

06:37.826 --> 06:39.397
That makes a difference.

06:39.820 --> 06:41.492
What do you want me to do?

06:41.660 --> 06:44.087
I want you to tell me where he is.

06:44.733 --> 06:49.233
I hope you remember this
and someday do me a favor.

06:49.699 --> 06:51.422
He's not that far away.

06:51.547 --> 06:54.848
He's at the spider arms hostel.

07:05.522 --> 07:06.960
May I help you?

07:07.352 --> 07:09.079
We know where we're going.

07:09.994 --> 07:12.369
You know where you are going.

07:12.899 --> 07:15.669
We must be careful not to warn him.

07:15.959 --> 07:18.445
But, master, we don't
know where we're going.

07:19.418 --> 07:21.842
He could be in any one othese rooms.

07:22.256 --> 07:24.906
You need to be more quiet, young one.

07:25.477 --> 07:26.596
Okay, okay.

07:27.266 --> 07:30.879
Not quiet with your mouth,
quiet with your mind.

07:31.498 --> 07:34.375
You're so anxious to
find this pickpocket

07:34.500 --> 07:37.074
That your worry is equal to his.

07:38.969 --> 07:42.928
You mean if I relax,
I can sense Bannamu's anxiety?

07:43.246 --> 07:49.018
Yes. If you relax, you would
realize he's in this room.

07:54.637 --> 07:55.662
Well, well.

07:55.787 --> 07:57.359
Bannamu, I assume.

07:57.484 --> 08:00.007
Who are you, huh?
What do you want?

08:00.976 --> 08:02.789
My lightsaber, you slimy thief.

08:03.085 --> 08:04.789
I want it back now.

08:05.077 --> 08:06.592
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:06.799 --> 08:10.740
I no have it, I swear.
I got rid of it.

08:11.256 --> 08:14.212
I almost kill myself with that thing.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.448
What did you do with it?

08:16.573 --> 08:18.631
No, I don't recall.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.765
- You little--
- Ahsoka.

08:23.228 --> 08:25.711
It's not smart to steal from a Jedi.

08:26.657 --> 08:29.516
You're looking a little
too young to be a Jedi.

08:32.258 --> 08:33.115
Come on.

08:33.938 --> 08:37.312
Okay, okay, okay
his name is Movers.

08:37.437 --> 08:39.578
Yes, uh, Nack Movers.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.049
Nack Movers?

08:42.543 --> 08:44.720
He's a very dangerous one,

08:44.845 --> 08:46.622
Well known in the underworld.

08:47.662 --> 08:49.140
Yes, exactly.

08:49.554 --> 08:51.377
I sell it to him.

08:52.224 --> 08:54.303
You should be afraid.

08:54.428 --> 08:58.296
I got a good price, huh?
He was very, very motivated.

08:58.713 --> 09:00.869
You can find him with his girlfriend.

09:00.994 --> 09:04.416
She has a place on the upper
east side of our happy land.

09:05.224 --> 09:08.180
I bet he's there now.
Oh, he's always there.

09:08.219 --> 09:09.848
You can stop talking now.

09:09.973 --> 09:11.253
Okay, I shut up.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.520
Well, at least you know
where your lightsaber is.

09:14.795 --> 09:16.913
Yeah, it's in the hands of a killer.

09:17.130 --> 09:19.844
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

09:24.990 --> 09:27.108
Master, we've got to hurry.

09:27.586 --> 09:29.281
Patience, young one.

09:29.596 --> 09:32.727
You worry that if people
die at the hands of your,

09:32.852 --> 09:35.929
Lightsaber that you will be as guilty,

09:36.054 --> 09:39.081
For their death as the one
that strikes the blow.

09:40.008 --> 09:41.988
A valid concern, young one,

09:42.928 --> 09:45.460
And one for you to puzzle out.

09:48.523 --> 09:50.198
What?
What is it?

09:51.082 --> 09:53.791
I believe we've reached
our destination.

09:57.948 --> 09:58.766
Oh, no.

10:00.727 --> 10:01.791
Let me guess.

10:02.165 --> 10:03.367
Nack Movers

10:03.761 --> 10:05.870
A reasonable assumption.

10:06.165 --> 10:07.263
He's dead.

10:11.121 --> 10:13.594
- Are they gone?
- Who's gone?

10:13.719 --> 10:15.318
The men who killed Nack.

10:18.855 --> 10:19.859
Who are you?

10:20.225 --> 10:21.417
Ione Marcy.

10:21.673 --> 10:24.008
I came home and found
him here like this.

10:24.949 --> 10:26.599
Ione, did you call for help?

10:26.997 --> 10:28.243
Why were you hiding?

10:28.613 --> 10:29.608
I was afraid.

10:35.586 --> 10:37.300
She seems terrified.

10:40.490 --> 10:43.357
And yet I sense something
else is troubling her.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.843
I'll search the other rooms.

11:08.911 --> 11:11.117
Time to die !

11:12.162 --> 11:14.664
- How does this work?
- My lightsaber.

11:14.930 --> 11:16.332
You're a Jedi?

11:42.662 --> 11:44.406
Master Sinube, you're right.

11:44.642 --> 11:47.243
I found the intruder,
and she has my lightsaber.

11:47.368 --> 11:49.490
She's a terellian jango jumper,

11:49.615 --> 11:51.313
<i>And hard to keep up with.</i>

11:51.963 --> 11:54.249
The assailant is a female?

12:27.553 --> 12:28.578
That's it.

12:42.301 --> 12:45.631
I'm sure my little friend
will catch up to your intruder.

12:46.239 --> 12:48.239
You have nothing to worry about.

12:50.791 --> 12:52.495
Right, of course.

13:04.751 --> 13:08.402
Your friend Nack wasn't
a very good fighter, was he?

13:08.702 --> 13:11.145
- Or maybe he was poisoned.
- What?

13:12.078 --> 13:15.408
Obviously he's come
to an unfortunate end.

13:15.911 --> 13:18.678
He'd be stronger than the
average man, though,

13:18.803 --> 13:20.077
Wouldn't you say?

13:21.092 --> 13:22.668
I guess.

13:33.952 --> 13:37.885
You said a group of men killed
your friend Nack Movers.

13:38.309 --> 13:42.827
And yet my padawan described
the assailant as a female.

13:43.351 --> 13:46.218
There was a group of them.
I didn't get a good look.

13:47.078 --> 13:49.986
I also contacted the
authorities to come here

13:50.111 --> 13:53.322
And help you with your
unfortunate friend.

13:55.216 --> 13:56.467
You're very kind.

14:40.788 --> 14:43.310
<i>I have no doubt,
that the Jedi are doing</i>

14:43.435 --> 14:45.041
<i>Their very best to ensure</i>

14:45.166 --> 14:48.002
<i>The safety of every citizen in the Republic.</i>

14:50.756 --> 14:54.551
<i>The accusations that the Jedi
created the Clone War</i>

14:54.676 --> 14:56.005
<i>To give more power</i>

15:02.067 --> 15:03.574
You should have a seat.

15:04.884 --> 15:07.426
You might have been distraught before,

15:07.761 --> 15:11.308
But ever since the intruder
left your apartment,

15:11.874 --> 15:14.387
You've become even more nervous.

15:15.017 --> 15:20.444
I'm upset. This whole ordeal
I just endured, it's upsetting.

15:20.744 --> 15:23.371
<i>Count Dooku and his droid army.</i>

15:23.539 --> 15:26.111
<i>To support the Jedi's
efforts in the war</i>

15:26.236 --> 15:29.669
<i>I ask the Senate to
pass these new laws</i>

15:29.794 --> 15:30.753
<i>Giving more...</i>

15:39.631 --> 15:42.486
is there a reason
you might be concerned?

15:51.049 --> 15:53.611
You weren't afraid because
you were in danger.

15:54.034 --> 15:56.793
You were afraid we would
find your friend,

15:56.918 --> 15:58.251
Hiding in the other room.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.842
You're in league
with the bounty hunter.

16:04.477 --> 16:05.629
Arrest her.

16:11.985 --> 16:15.729
Off she goes, always rushing.

16:16.655 --> 16:19.679
Cassie, the Jedi know I'm involved.
I had to run.

16:19.928 --> 16:22.305
Just get over to J street and pick me up.

17:07.512 --> 17:10.252
I see you've learned patience, young one.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.310
Where'd you get that speeder?

17:12.435 --> 17:15.117
I asked one of the police
droids to lend me,

17:15.146 --> 17:16.358
Some transportation.

17:16.723 --> 17:19.295
They were kind enough to oblige.

17:29.818 --> 17:33.858
You're driving too slow.
We need to go faster.

17:33.983 --> 17:38.029
Patience. We'll cut them
off at the train station.

17:38.154 --> 17:40.282
How do you know they're headed there?

17:40.407 --> 17:44.536
Did I mention I planted
a tracking device on Ione,

17:44.661 --> 17:47.539
- The girl that ran away ?
- No.

18:35.581 --> 18:36.588
Stop them.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.364
Halt. Halt.

18:42.034 --> 18:43.827
You're under arrest.

19:06.614 --> 19:08.712
You ran off in such a hurry.

19:09.008 --> 19:11.790
I trust you didn't mean to be rude.

19:11.958 --> 19:14.287
I have nothing more to say to you, Jedi.

19:15.910 --> 19:18.520
Perhaps you meant
to be a little rude.

19:40.899 --> 19:42.327
You're trapped.

19:42.603 --> 19:46.002
Surrender now and turn the lightsaber over to me.

19:46.229 --> 19:48.081
Don't tell me what to do.

19:48.206 --> 19:51.133
I've got a lightsaber,
and I'm as powerful as a Jedi.

19:58.374 --> 19:59.911
I'll trade myself for them.

20:00.036 --> 20:02.867
You know how much I'm worth to the Jedi.

20:02.906 --> 20:08.224
It's a good deal. All you have
to do is let them go.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.776
Once we're alone,

20:12.901 --> 20:15.809
You'd use some kind of Jedi force trick on me.

20:15.934 --> 20:18.565
No deal.
These two stay with me.

20:18.862 --> 20:20.872
And you, you stay out of my way.

20:42.381 --> 20:43.871
For a guy that moves slow,

20:43.996 --> 20:45.970
You always seem to
get ahead of me.

20:46.095 --> 20:49.902
The value of moving slowly
is that one can always clearly,

20:50.027 --> 20:51.445
See the way ahead.

21:10.647 --> 21:13.021
I best be getting back to
my master before.

21:13.146 --> 21:14.078
He misses me.

21:14.362 --> 21:15.307
Certainly.

21:15.809 --> 21:19.217
First I need one last favor from you.

21:19.759 --> 21:21.205
Sure.
Name it.

21:21.462 --> 21:23.521
Pass on what you
have learned.

21:31.138 --> 21:32.950
Hello old friend.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.049
Greetings, master Sinube.

21:35.650 --> 21:38.763
Padawan Tano, a lesson
you have for us today ?

21:39.383 --> 21:42.743
- Yes.
- A lesson in patience.

21:43.317 --> 21:46.441
Gather 'round, younglings.
Listen to the padawan you shall.

21:48.854 --> 21:50.421
This weapon is your life.

21:50.937 --> 21:54.268
But it is also your responsibility.

21:55.222 --> 21:57.576
Don't let it out of your sight.

21:58.305 --> 22:04.450
