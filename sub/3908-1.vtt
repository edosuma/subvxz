( sighs )

02:17.126 --> 02:18.660
You all right, bud?

02:19.662 --> 02:21.496
Yeah, I'm okay.

02:22.632 --> 02:24.833
Worried about the other kids?

02:24.884 --> 02:27.302
How much longer do I
have to go to school?

02:28.588 --> 02:31.173
A while longer, sorry to say.

02:32.308 --> 02:33.892
( sighs )

02:33.926 --> 02:37.229
You got that camping trip
coming up next weekend, huh?

02:37.263 --> 02:38.813
That'll be fun, right?

02:43.102 --> 02:44.936
Hey, you like your new kicks?

02:50.526 --> 02:52.627
All right.
Go on, pal.

02:52.662 --> 02:55.530
Mom or Richard
will pick you up.

02:55.532 --> 02:57.532
I'll see you
in two weeks, yeah?

02:59.402 --> 03:01.703
Head up.

03:01.754 --> 03:03.588
Strong.

03:10.213 --> 03:13.598
Hey, I love you, buddy.

03:13.633 --> 03:15.383
Now be proud.

03:27.063 --> 03:30.115
Hey, Chad.
Nice sweater.

03:30.149 --> 03:31.866
I really like it.

03:31.901 --> 03:34.452
Oh, and I like your shoes, too.
They match your hair.

03:34.487 --> 03:37.906
- It's great.
- <i> ( bell rings )</i>

03:40.042 --> 03:43.578

03:44.747 --> 03:46.248
Ray:
<i>It wasn't an incident.</i>

03:46.250 --> 03:48.917
She was--
she was beaten.

03:48.968 --> 03:50.585
Raped.

03:51.671 --> 03:53.805
I'm sorry, I need to ask.

03:53.839 --> 03:57.058
Your wife,
was she pregnant at the time?

03:58.427 --> 04:00.762
We think so.

04:00.764 --> 04:03.565
<i>You were trying</i>
<i>a long time, right?</i>

04:03.599 --> 04:05.934
Mmm.

04:05.985 --> 04:10.488
<i>Your son was born nine
months after what happened?</i>

04:12.608 --> 04:16.695
<i>And they never caught the
man who did it, correct?</i>

04:22.752 --> 04:24.953
No.

04:25.004 --> 04:27.022
They never caught the guy.

04:30.176 --> 04:32.460
And how is the relationship
with your son?

04:32.511 --> 04:34.879
It's good.
It's real good.

04:34.930 --> 04:37.766
I mean, he's a--
he's a true-blue kid.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.018
You know?
I have--

04:40.052 --> 04:44.022
I bought us-- I got us
these digital recorders.

04:44.056 --> 04:47.142
You see? So we can send
each other letters, like,

04:47.193 --> 04:48.810
and express stuff, talk.

04:48.812 --> 04:51.529
Book said that can
be effective, so...

04:51.564 --> 04:53.648
<i>So why do you feel</i>
<i>your visitation rights</i>

04:53.699 --> 04:55.817
<i>should be expanded,</i>
<i>Detective Velcoro?</i>

04:55.868 --> 04:58.320
Well, how about
I raised him alone

04:58.371 --> 05:00.822
for two months
when she took off?

05:00.873 --> 05:03.992
You know?
It was me and him.

05:04.043 --> 05:07.829
She comes back,
she's talking divorce.

05:07.831 --> 05:09.881
<i>Did either of you</i>
<i>request a paternity test?</i>

05:09.915 --> 05:12.033
No.

05:12.068 --> 05:14.135
My son is my son.

05:14.170 --> 05:16.388
They're gonna ask
that question.

05:16.422 --> 05:18.023
<i>More rudely than I just did.</i>

05:18.057 --> 05:20.842
Look, you're not getting--

05:20.844 --> 05:23.928
there's me and him
and I'm his dad.

05:23.979 --> 05:27.599
And I just need you to come
up with something, all right?

05:27.650 --> 05:29.484
<i>You might have the wrong idea.</i>

05:29.518 --> 05:31.686
Why? You like
paying taxes?

05:32.822 --> 05:34.689
Just...

05:35.925 --> 05:37.759
<i>You were with</i>
<i>LA Sheriff's Department</i>

05:37.793 --> 05:39.894
<i>eight years before Vinci PD.</i>

05:39.929 --> 05:42.364
<i>Anything there gonna hurt you?</i>

05:42.398 --> 05:43.932
No.

05:43.966 --> 05:45.867
I welcome judgment.

05:46.936 --> 05:49.204
( bell ringing )

06:18.951 --> 06:21.069
Deputy Velcoro, right?

06:24.290 --> 06:26.825
This filth hurt your woman.

06:28.544 --> 06:31.079
We know this guy.

06:31.081 --> 06:33.548
Tell me.

06:33.582 --> 06:38.086
Sometimes everybody's
not always on the same side.

06:39.255 --> 06:41.423
Fine, it's business.

06:43.092 --> 06:47.011
But this... no.

06:47.046 --> 06:48.930
Fuck that.

06:50.299 --> 06:51.566
Some things don't stand.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.701
What do you know about it?

07:24.133 --> 07:25.967
Frank:
<i>Fits the description, right?</i>

07:26.018 --> 07:29.137
My people know him.
He's not with us.

07:29.139 --> 07:30.638
Amphetamine freak.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.475
Bragged about it, said, well,

07:33.477 --> 07:36.110
matched your wife's account.

07:36.145 --> 07:37.529
How do you know
my wife's account?

07:37.563 --> 07:39.147
This is only information, man.

07:39.149 --> 07:41.432
Shit in the air.

07:41.467 --> 07:43.485
I'm sharing with you.

07:46.572 --> 07:48.706
I wanted to do this.

07:50.326 --> 07:52.260
And now it's done.

07:53.128 --> 07:54.412
That's it.

07:54.463 --> 07:56.881
What do you want from me?

07:56.916 --> 07:58.166
Me?

07:58.168 --> 07:59.834
Yeah.

07:59.836 --> 08:01.803
Not a thing.

08:02.755 --> 08:04.806
Maybe we'll talk sometime.

08:06.141 --> 08:07.725
Maybe not.

08:10.846 --> 08:13.982
Your wife, she doing better?

08:25.895 --> 08:27.929
- <i> ( door opens )</i>

08:27.963 --> 08:29.914
<i>( door closes )</i>

09:09.455 --> 09:10.905
Did you go to sleep?

09:10.956 --> 09:13.241
No. Big day.

09:13.292 --> 09:14.909
All the marbles.

09:32.595 --> 09:34.979
Suits you better
than you think.

09:36.098 --> 09:38.900
Behold what was once a man.

09:40.352 --> 09:42.186
You think I should have
sprung for the country club?

09:42.237 --> 09:43.488
Don't put on airs.

09:43.522 --> 09:46.407
You don't need
to fake anything.

09:46.442 --> 09:48.276
You're better than that.

10:12.134 --> 10:14.519
( chatter )

10:20.809 --> 10:22.860
Frank: <i>Caspere pitches
at developers.</i>

10:22.895 --> 10:25.113
Russians in for five.

10:26.615 --> 10:28.716
Somebody taking Osip
through customs?

10:28.751 --> 10:31.469
United Ambassadors are
meeting him at the ramp.

10:31.503 --> 10:33.071
Maybe I should have
gone to the airport.

10:33.122 --> 10:34.822
Don't want to look hungry.

10:34.873 --> 10:37.291
Never do anything
out of hunger,

10:37.326 --> 10:38.993
not even eating.

10:43.499 --> 10:44.799
What?

10:48.504 --> 10:50.838
The fuck?
An eight-part series?

10:50.889 --> 10:53.725
Blake: <i>Talks city corruptions,
sweatshops, nothing on us.</i>

10:53.759 --> 10:55.810
Nothing, huh?

10:55.844 --> 10:57.395
What's Osip gonna
tweak from this?

10:57.429 --> 10:59.731
<i>That we're not buttoned
down at the least.</i>

10:59.765 --> 11:03.434
Could put Tom or Ivar on the
reporter you want, but I think--

11:03.485 --> 11:05.687
No, get Velcoro.

11:05.738 --> 11:07.188
He won't get carried away.

11:07.239 --> 11:10.074
If this story gets play, there
could be a state investigation.

11:10.109 --> 11:11.826
But I'm saying
you're not touched.

11:14.246 --> 11:18.332
This place is built on a
codependency of interest.

11:19.752 --> 11:21.703
Worries me,
you talking so stupid.

11:28.010 --> 11:30.011
Everybody gets touched.

11:34.717 --> 11:36.884
<i>( car door opens )</i>

12:40.950 --> 12:42.700
Look, don't let that ruin it.

12:42.751 --> 12:44.285
Just-- it took me
by surprise was all.

12:44.336 --> 12:45.369
You know?
I didn't expect that.

12:45.420 --> 12:47.255
Forget it.
Don't worry about it.

12:47.289 --> 12:49.173
Oh, come on, we don't
have to stop, right?

12:49.208 --> 12:51.425
You know, it's just
I wasn't really ready.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.878
I didn't think--
I mean, I don't know.

12:53.929 --> 12:55.963
<i>Do you--</i>
<i>do you like that?</i>

12:55.965 --> 12:57.965
Sometimes.

12:58.016 --> 13:00.935
Okay. I just didn't
think that most women--

13:00.969 --> 13:03.221
you know, you, would--
I'm just used to--

13:03.272 --> 13:06.224
you know, I mean--
have you done that a lot?

13:06.275 --> 13:08.392
Let's not talk this to death.

13:11.864 --> 13:14.532
Hey, I still got
some time before I report.

13:14.566 --> 13:16.317
Yeah, I've got
to get ready for work.

13:16.319 --> 13:18.786
Can we talk?
Please?

13:18.821 --> 13:21.539
I mean, forget this,
what just happened.

13:21.573 --> 13:23.791
You know, I think
this is good, right?

13:23.826 --> 13:25.960
Depends on what's expected.

13:27.045 --> 13:29.664
Well, I wanted--
I mean, I thought,

13:29.666 --> 13:32.133
you know, maybe we could talk
about taking things forward.

13:32.167 --> 13:34.502
Steve, you're a nice guy,
but right now is not the time

13:34.504 --> 13:35.670
you want to have
this conversation.

13:35.721 --> 13:37.889
Okay.
But if you--

13:37.923 --> 13:41.309
Can you get your stuff?
'Cause I gotta get going.

13:43.145 --> 13:44.729
Yeah.

14:04.583 --> 14:06.000
Sheriff's Department!

14:06.034 --> 14:09.503
- Yo, what's this?
- Hands! Hands! On your knees.

14:09.538 --> 14:11.539
You running hookers?

14:12.624 --> 14:13.875
( woman screams )

14:13.926 --> 14:15.376
Officer: <i>Right there!
Stay there!</i>

14:15.378 --> 14:17.378
- ( screams )
- <i> Sheriff's Department!</i>

14:17.429 --> 14:19.096
Hands up!
Get up! Get up!

14:19.131 --> 14:20.882
- Clear!
- All right, everybody out.

14:20.884 --> 14:22.800
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

14:22.851 --> 14:25.269
Officer: <i>Right here, right here.
Let's go, move, move.</i>

14:29.274 --> 14:31.108
Officer #2:
<i>Clear in the back.</i>

14:33.145 --> 14:35.196
- What is this?
- Webcams.

14:35.230 --> 14:37.064
Private subscribers.
Totally legit.

14:37.115 --> 14:38.566
We ain't broke no law of yours.

14:38.568 --> 14:40.534
Got IDs for these girls?
Visas?

14:40.569 --> 14:42.620
They American,
that what you mean?

14:42.654 --> 14:44.238
Who here is an American?

14:44.289 --> 14:46.290
Say "I am an American"
one by one.

14:46.325 --> 14:47.742
I am an American.

14:47.826 --> 14:49.076
I am an American.

14:49.127 --> 14:51.746
- <i> I am an American.</i>
- <i> I am an American.</i>

14:51.797 --> 14:54.081
- This is private property.
- Shut the fuck up.

14:54.083 --> 14:56.000
Come on, now. Everybody out.
Let's go.

14:56.051 --> 14:57.335
Let's go, on your feet.

14:57.369 --> 14:58.719
Hey!

15:02.758 --> 15:04.642
( chickens clucking )

15:06.345 --> 15:07.895
All right.

15:07.930 --> 15:11.432
I ran this op
because I heard a rumor.

15:11.483 --> 15:13.901
Unbelievable. Porn.

15:13.936 --> 15:16.153
It's not porn, okay?

15:16.188 --> 15:18.689
Not everybody has a problem with sex.
I'm a performer.

15:18.740 --> 15:20.107
Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

15:20.109 --> 15:22.827
So this is like some kind
of Meryl Streep type

15:22.861 --> 15:24.612
expressive creativity?

15:24.663 --> 15:26.247
I-- are you off
your meds?

15:26.281 --> 15:29.750
( scoffs ) God, you're
fucking hilarious, man.

15:29.785 --> 15:31.786
You want people
to stop screwing

15:31.837 --> 15:33.788
and start taking drugs, right?

15:33.790 --> 15:35.957
- That is so typical. So typical you.
- That's not--

15:35.959 --> 15:38.676
This isn't right.
It's not healthy.

15:38.710 --> 15:41.696
Not healthy? Really? And what do
you know about being healthy?

15:41.730 --> 15:43.848
When you walk,
it's like erasers clapping.

15:43.882 --> 15:45.349
- Okay. Okay.
- This isn't your business.

15:45.384 --> 15:49.303
So what is this? This is like
another "I hate my sister" cycle?

15:49.305 --> 15:51.305
When does that stop?
You take another bust?

15:51.356 --> 15:54.275
Bust doing what?
Masturbating?

15:56.645 --> 15:59.230
I'm straight edge now, okay?
I'm totally clean.

15:59.281 --> 16:01.115
Okay, then maybe you should
get back on something.

16:02.868 --> 16:06.737
You know, what you say are my problems
are really your fucking problems.

16:10.959 --> 16:13.044
<i>( police radio chatter )</i>

16:13.078 --> 16:15.046
( clicks tongue )

16:19.334 --> 16:21.719
Don't think we got anything.

16:21.753 --> 16:24.071
They even have
the business license.

16:26.391 --> 16:28.426
Yep.

16:56.455 --> 16:58.539
Chief: <i>That low background
rumble is the sound</i>

16:58.541 --> 17:00.374
<i>of paper shredders</i>
<i>on the third floor.</i>

17:00.409 --> 17:03.177
First part of a series,
it says.

17:03.211 --> 17:06.047
Chief: <i>Talks about
municipal salaries,</i>

17:06.049 --> 17:07.381
<i>undocumented workers,</i>

17:07.383 --> 17:09.950
pollution, policing practices.

17:09.984 --> 17:11.886
He uses the word extortionary.

17:11.936 --> 17:13.270
Are we expecting subpoenas?

17:13.305 --> 17:15.189
You know Ben Caspere,
the city manager?

17:15.223 --> 17:17.558
Gone missing. Second day he
hasn't shown up for work.

17:17.608 --> 17:19.143
Lots of people looking for him.

17:19.194 --> 17:21.278
- Fix on his phone?
- Shut off.

17:21.313 --> 17:23.146
Mayor Chessani's on DEFCON.

17:23.198 --> 17:25.232
His office has been
on the horn all morning.

17:25.233 --> 17:26.983
Some big meeting today.

17:27.035 --> 17:28.402
<i>Get with Teague Dixon on this.</i>

17:28.453 --> 17:30.654
Caspere is officially
a missing person.

17:30.705 --> 17:32.790
Dixon?

17:32.824 --> 17:34.575
Seriously,
Lieutenant, he's--

17:34.626 --> 17:36.827
We're lucky just
to detail the two of you.

17:41.299 --> 17:43.751
Uh, you know
where I should start?

17:43.753 --> 17:46.670
City manager's office,
I imagine.

17:47.589 --> 17:49.256
All right.

18:04.322 --> 18:07.825
- ( tires squealing )
- ( horn honking )

18:09.494 --> 18:11.946
( siren blaring )

18:22.124 --> 18:25.376
License and registration,
please, ma'am.

18:26.628 --> 18:28.679
Uh, yes. Yeah.

18:34.469 --> 18:36.971
Um... I, um...

18:37.022 --> 18:40.724
don't have my license
on me right now.

18:40.775 --> 18:42.810
It's at my house.

18:42.861 --> 18:45.396
It's just, like,
a mile away in Malibu.

18:45.447 --> 18:47.982
I'm really close.

18:48.033 --> 18:50.734
You had anything to drink
this morning, ma'am?

18:50.785 --> 18:52.786
To drink?

18:52.821 --> 18:54.321
No. No, sir.

18:54.323 --> 18:56.207
Well, I absolutely
have not ha--

18:56.241 --> 18:58.492
have not have had
anything to drink.

18:58.494 --> 19:01.045
Would you step out of
the car for me, ma'am?

19:01.079 --> 19:02.830
<i>( seagull screeching )</i>

19:02.832 --> 19:04.715
Sir,

19:04.749 --> 19:07.551
please, if I get
in trouble again...

19:07.636 --> 19:11.505
<i>Look, I pay my parents'</i>
<i>bills for them and...</i>

19:12.641 --> 19:15.476
Um, look,

19:15.510 --> 19:19.897
maybe you could
just escort me home

19:19.931 --> 19:22.049
<i>and we could talk</i>

19:22.083 --> 19:24.518
<i>or do something.</i>

19:24.520 --> 19:27.771
A trade, like...

19:32.978 --> 19:36.363
Floyd: <i>Hell, I know, Paul.
We all know it's bullshit.</i>

19:36.365 --> 19:40.201
<i>Soliciting a blowjob</i>
<i>to avoid a citation.</i>

19:40.235 --> 19:41.569
<i>That ain't you, kid.</i>

19:41.603 --> 19:44.255
But it's cut the tabloids
on that mercenary work.

19:44.289 --> 19:47.174
This actress,
she violated her parole

19:47.209 --> 19:50.544
by leaving the fucking house
to score, I guess.

19:50.546 --> 19:54.014
Swerves into traffic
high, freaks,

19:54.049 --> 19:55.382
I'm getting flushed.

19:55.417 --> 19:56.717
- No.
- Yes.

19:56.768 --> 19:59.887
Administrative leave with pay
just until IA finishes.

19:59.938 --> 20:01.889
The Black Mountain work,

20:01.940 --> 20:04.441
do you know how hard
they're looking?

20:11.399 --> 20:14.201
You got a little
vacation, that's all.

20:14.236 --> 20:15.786
Comes back around
about this girl,

20:15.820 --> 20:17.821
and it will,
you'll be reinstated.

20:17.872 --> 20:19.490
Back on the bike?

20:19.541 --> 20:21.742
I like the bike, sir.

20:21.776 --> 20:25.879
The highway, it suits me.

20:25.914 --> 20:28.315
I am no good on the sidelines.

20:30.752 --> 20:32.336
The other watch commanders

20:32.387 --> 20:34.838
want me to convey
our full support.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.434
Black Mountain.

20:49.104 --> 20:51.589
We were working
for America, sir.

20:51.623 --> 20:53.691
I know you were, son.

21:09.174 --> 21:11.625
Woodrugh, tell me it's true.

21:11.676 --> 21:13.711
( men laugh )

21:29.311 --> 21:32.062
- <i> ( music playing )</i>
- ( chatter )

21:33.815 --> 21:36.283
Hey, Bart.
Enjoying it?

21:36.318 --> 21:37.651
- Yes.
- All right.

21:37.702 --> 21:39.903
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

21:48.129 --> 21:51.081
Mayor.
You heard from Caspere?

21:51.132 --> 21:53.884
Newspaper shit
couldn't wait, huh?

21:55.837 --> 21:57.388
Federal contracts come through,

21:57.422 --> 21:59.840
they can write all the
stories they fucking want.

21:59.842 --> 22:02.676
Newspaper's not
gonna be a problem.

22:02.727 --> 22:05.679
Let's allow an afternoon
for celebration, gents.

22:05.681 --> 22:09.433
See that? I tell people
it's her brains.

22:12.821 --> 22:14.355
Maybe you'd like
something to eat?

22:14.406 --> 22:16.106
Please.

22:17.492 --> 22:19.910
- See you in a bit.
- Yeah.

22:26.534 --> 22:29.086
Caspere hasn't been
to work in two days.

22:29.120 --> 22:32.873
He hasn't? This is his
entire goddamn pitch.

22:34.376 --> 22:36.460
Watch the mayor.
He's getting a load on.

22:36.511 --> 22:38.879
You think I should have
sprung for the country club?

22:38.930 --> 22:40.547
Nah.

22:40.598 --> 22:42.599
What did you say
about looking hungry?

22:45.103 --> 22:47.554
- Osip landed yet?
- Just touched down.

22:49.641 --> 22:52.393
Ray: <i> - No family?</i>
Woman: <i> - Bachelor.</i>

22:52.427 --> 22:55.028
Ray: <i>He didn't have any
trips on the books?</i>

22:55.063 --> 22:56.647
Not the type to just take off?

22:56.698 --> 23:00.000
No, sir. He wouldn't leave
without saying something.

23:00.034 --> 23:01.785
He had been
going up to Monterey

23:01.820 --> 23:03.320
and the Russian River
Valley a lot,

23:03.371 --> 23:06.707
but he wouldn't be
out of touch like this.

23:06.741 --> 23:08.909
He mention anything
about the newspaper?

23:08.960 --> 23:10.911
You know, that journalist.

23:10.962 --> 23:12.379
Nothing I've heard.

23:12.414 --> 23:14.715
I've only been here
about six weeks, though.

23:14.749 --> 23:16.717
I didn't know
a whole lot about him yet.

23:16.751 --> 23:19.136
Bad blood?
Any enemies?

23:20.305 --> 23:22.556
I don't think so.

23:22.590 --> 23:25.259
I mean, not like enemies.

23:25.310 --> 23:28.145
Mr. Caspere sort of holds the
purse strings for a lot of stuff.

23:28.179 --> 23:29.930
A lot of people
have to go through him.

23:29.932 --> 23:31.765
Okay.

23:31.816 --> 23:34.768
<i>Can you give us</i>
<i>a list of his properties?</i>

23:34.819 --> 23:38.238
I-- well, I guess
that's okay.

23:38.273 --> 23:41.141
Sure, it is.
We're the police.

23:44.696 --> 23:46.780
Big place for one guy.

24:08.386 --> 24:11.221
Ray: Hey, you see
that, too, right?

24:22.033 --> 24:24.485
Now we got us
something-something.

24:41.219 --> 24:43.003
Ray:
<i>You ever meet this guy?</i>

24:43.037 --> 24:46.173
Teague: <i>Once or twice.
Some civic thing.</i>

24:47.175 --> 24:48.475
( chuckles )

24:48.510 --> 24:51.595
I had no idea he was so...

24:51.629 --> 24:53.780
<i>adventurous.</i>

25:06.828 --> 25:09.363
You know, I got instructions.

25:09.365 --> 25:12.866
Anything happens to me,
you burn all my shit quick.

25:18.706 --> 25:20.374
Took the computer.

25:41.279 --> 25:43.564
This is fucked.

25:44.782 --> 25:46.567
We need a tech crew
in here for prints.

25:46.618 --> 25:49.453
Anything they can catch.
Catalog what's left behind.

25:49.487 --> 25:50.904
We should let the bosses know.

25:50.906 --> 25:53.490
You sure they
don't know already?

25:54.709 --> 25:57.077
<i>We need to treat this</i>
<i>like a 207.</i>

25:57.128 --> 25:59.296
- What?
- Kidnapping.

26:00.999 --> 26:03.133
Teague, we don't
belong on this.

26:04.719 --> 26:06.386
- <i> ( music playing )</i>
- ( chatter )

26:06.421 --> 26:09.723
Francis Semyon.
Look now at you.

26:11.392 --> 26:12.893
( chuckles )

26:12.927 --> 26:16.096
This man in the '90s,
what a terror.

26:16.098 --> 26:18.398
The good life suits you.

26:20.518 --> 26:22.769
Osip, have a champagne.

26:24.105 --> 26:26.239
To friends and the future.

26:26.274 --> 26:27.941
Hear, hear.

26:29.444 --> 26:31.945
Frank, I don't think
you met Michael in Paris.

26:31.947 --> 26:34.081
Michael Bugulari, my attorney.

26:34.115 --> 26:36.950
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Semyon.

26:39.454 --> 26:41.538
Osip, you should
meet some people.

26:41.589 --> 26:43.957
Contractors, developers.

26:49.847 --> 26:54.134
If he turns up, I'm gonna put my
size 13s so far up Caspere's ass...

26:56.104 --> 26:57.688
He'll spit shoelaces?

27:33.591 --> 27:36.677
Ani: They should make the fucking
banks deliver these things.

27:39.030 --> 27:40.797
Woman: <i>This the best they
got for police to do?</i>

27:40.832 --> 27:42.899
<i>Take people's houses?</i>

27:42.934 --> 27:45.168
They just make us
drop the paper, ma'am.

27:45.203 --> 27:46.853
We are sorry.

27:46.888 --> 27:49.823
( grunting in video game )

27:49.857 --> 27:51.358
Woman:
<i>You want to be police?</i>

27:51.392 --> 27:53.360
Why don't y'all find my sister?

27:53.362 --> 27:56.747
Uh, who's that?
She missing?

27:59.867 --> 28:02.869
My little sister Vera.

28:02.871 --> 28:05.839
She's 24.

28:05.873 --> 28:08.291
- How long she been missing?
- We're not sure.

28:08.342 --> 28:10.260
I mean, about a month ago,

28:10.294 --> 28:13.096
I hadn't heard from her
for a few weeks.

28:13.131 --> 28:16.466
Started calling,
getting voice mail.

28:17.468 --> 28:19.102
One day it's disconnected.

28:19.137 --> 28:21.054
I go to her apartment.

28:21.056 --> 28:24.608
Her old roommate says
she moved out a while back.

28:24.642 --> 28:27.310
Took all her stuff.
They didn't know where.

28:28.946 --> 28:30.063
Does she have a job?

28:30.114 --> 28:32.382
She worked as a maid
at a couple of places.

28:32.417 --> 28:34.901
But they said she quit.

28:34.903 --> 28:37.571
Well, could you come down,

28:37.573 --> 28:39.539
file a report, and we
could get started on it?

28:39.574 --> 28:42.409
We told city police.
Never heard anything.

28:42.460 --> 28:45.545
<i>Last place she worked,</i>
<i>this, like,</i>

28:45.580 --> 28:48.982
religious place, an institute.

28:50.251 --> 28:52.636
Panticapaeum?

28:52.670 --> 28:54.721
The Panticapaeum Institute?

28:54.756 --> 28:57.724
<i>Yeah, that's it.</i>

28:57.759 --> 29:00.093
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

29:06.934 --> 29:09.603
Our city manager Ben Caspere
was going to be here

29:09.605 --> 29:11.354
to explain this,

29:11.405 --> 29:14.991
but I suppose I can
approximate the information.

29:15.026 --> 29:18.028
So everybody knows
Proposition 1 has passed.

29:18.079 --> 29:20.697
And next year
construction will start

29:20.748 --> 29:23.817
on a $68 billion
high-speed rail

29:23.851 --> 29:25.535
up Central California.

29:25.586 --> 29:28.121
An undeveloped valley
adjacent to the rail

29:28.123 --> 29:30.173
<i>and the coastal highway</i>
<i>has been purchased</i>

29:30.208 --> 29:32.509
by several holding companies

29:32.543 --> 29:34.761
anticipating
a commercial development

29:34.796 --> 29:38.298
<i>that will be in line</i>
<i>for hundreds of millions</i>

29:38.300 --> 29:39.933
in federal grants.

29:39.967 --> 29:43.103
And the feds

29:43.137 --> 29:45.438
have guaranteed cost overages.

29:45.473 --> 29:47.274
( crowd murmuring )

30:15.553 --> 30:19.506
Man: <i>I was told something
a long time ago.</i>

30:19.557 --> 30:21.842
<i>Let me share it with you.</i>

30:21.844 --> 30:26.229
When you see
only with God's eyes,

30:26.264 --> 30:29.449
you see only the truth.

30:29.483 --> 30:33.320
<i>And you recognize</i>
<i>a meaningless universe.</i>

30:35.072 --> 30:38.859
Ginsberg said this to me once.

30:38.861 --> 30:40.760
And it was a gift.

30:40.795 --> 30:43.029
<i>So today's exercise</i>

30:43.031 --> 30:46.366
<i>is to recognize the world</i>
<i>as meaningless</i>

30:46.417 --> 30:50.403
and to understand
that God did not create

30:50.438 --> 30:52.289
a meaningless world.

30:52.340 --> 30:56.993
<i>Hold both thoughts</i>
<i>as irrefutable and equal,</i>

30:57.028 --> 31:00.714
because this is
how we must live now

31:00.765 --> 31:03.300
in the final age of man.

31:13.945 --> 31:17.214
She gave her notice
maybe two months back.

31:17.248 --> 31:18.565
Any forwarding address?

31:18.567 --> 31:22.235
No, she said she got a new
job, less hours, more money.

31:22.237 --> 31:25.622
Told me she was working,
like, some club circuit.

31:25.656 --> 31:28.658
<i>She mentioned Sonoma, I think.</i>

31:28.709 --> 31:30.677
All right if we talk
to the rest of your staff?

31:30.711 --> 31:33.129
Of course.

32:33.307 --> 32:34.641
Shh.

32:44.151 --> 32:47.454
<i>( punches landing )</i>

32:51.325 --> 32:53.543
I may have seen her.

32:53.577 --> 32:58.048
Just on the grounds, but, no.

32:59.133 --> 33:00.467
No, not speak to her.

33:00.501 --> 33:02.502
I wouldn't know her name.

33:04.221 --> 33:06.256
I still have an office, but...

33:06.307 --> 33:10.010
I don't spend as much
time here as I used to.

33:10.012 --> 33:12.645
Just a few lectures a year.

33:15.399 --> 33:17.817
I've wondered how you are.

33:18.986 --> 33:20.570
You talk to Athena?

33:20.604 --> 33:22.672
A few days ago, actually.

33:22.707 --> 33:24.691
She seems good.

33:25.576 --> 33:27.827
Clear eye, has a job.

33:27.862 --> 33:30.363
You talk to her that much?

33:30.414 --> 33:32.082
Do you know what her job is?

33:32.116 --> 33:33.366
Something on the Internet.

33:33.368 --> 33:36.086
Web camera performances,
she said.

33:36.120 --> 33:39.005
Athena, goddess of love.

33:40.708 --> 33:42.792
I won't go near computers,
you understand.

33:42.843 --> 33:45.345
She's doing porn.

33:45.379 --> 33:48.715
Well, what exactly is porn?

33:48.766 --> 33:51.684
I remember, you see,
when the status quo,

33:51.719 --> 33:53.887
they labeled anything they
didn't like pornography.

33:53.938 --> 33:55.472
Avant-garde cinema, then,

33:55.523 --> 33:58.525
featuring live sex acts
for paying customers.

33:58.559 --> 34:01.361
She has a different outlook.

34:01.395 --> 34:02.862
Athena said it was theater.

34:02.897 --> 34:04.280
God damn.

34:04.315 --> 34:07.200
You don't have any feeling,
your daughter doing that?

34:07.234 --> 34:09.735
Well, what would you
have me do, Antigone?

34:09.737 --> 34:12.705
Since I've never been good
at guessing your needs.

34:14.158 --> 34:17.793
Maybe talk her into doing
something with her life.

34:17.828 --> 34:21.581
Maybe convey some guidance,

34:21.632 --> 34:24.134
some values she could carry.

34:24.168 --> 34:26.418
We have always disagreed here.

34:26.420 --> 34:29.005
I am not comfortable
imposing my will on anyone

34:29.056 --> 34:31.257
and I haven't been since 1978.

34:31.308 --> 34:33.676
Not even to stop them
walking into a river.

34:33.726 --> 34:35.261
Yes, not even then.

34:35.312 --> 34:36.996
And if your mother's
flair for drama

34:37.031 --> 34:38.481
had been more present
in her acting,

34:38.516 --> 34:41.684
she might have gone on
to great things.

34:52.862 --> 34:55.732
These totems,

34:55.766 --> 34:58.952
they watch over
departed spirits.

35:01.205 --> 35:03.173
I've always felt
your mother among them.

35:03.207 --> 35:04.874
You won't even own it a little.

35:04.925 --> 35:07.377
She abandoned
the two of you, I didn't.

35:10.464 --> 35:12.298
You should spend less time
in a state of resistance

35:12.300 --> 35:15.635
making up problems
for yourself.

35:15.637 --> 35:17.303
What does that mean?

35:18.472 --> 35:21.724
A failed marriage,
a few relationships,

35:21.775 --> 35:24.144
you're angry
at the entire world

35:24.146 --> 35:25.812
and men in particular

35:25.863 --> 35:28.281
out of a false sense
of entitlement

35:28.315 --> 35:29.949
for something
you never received.

35:29.984 --> 35:32.952
Your entire personality

35:32.987 --> 35:35.622
is an extended criticism
of my values.

35:35.656 --> 35:37.490
Meant, I'm sure,

35:37.541 --> 35:40.160
to compel me into engagement
through argument.

35:42.830 --> 35:44.831
Do you even like what you do?

35:44.833 --> 35:48.668
Or is it just a reflexive urge
toward authority out of defiance?

35:48.702 --> 35:50.837
Talk to your daughter, prick.

35:50.839 --> 35:52.722
Help her.

35:56.060 --> 35:58.228
I just did.

36:05.653 --> 36:07.320
- Hey, bud.
- Dad?

36:07.354 --> 36:09.155
- Hey.
Richard: <i> - Hey, Ray.</i>

36:09.190 --> 36:10.607
You're not till next Friday.

36:10.658 --> 36:13.076
Hey, buddy, I knew you had
a camping trip coming up

36:13.110 --> 36:16.029
and I just wanted to--
here, it's a Coleman.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.614
It's, like, top line.

36:17.665 --> 36:19.499
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

36:19.533 --> 36:20.917
<i>Camping trip was last weekend.</i>

36:20.951 --> 36:23.536
He ended up having
a stomachache.

36:25.706 --> 36:27.340
Wait a minute.
Where's your shoes?

36:27.374 --> 36:30.710
- What? - He's wearing shoes.
Ray, you been drinking?

36:30.761 --> 36:33.546
Not those, the Nikes.

36:33.597 --> 36:36.182
The fucking LeBrons
or whatever.

36:36.217 --> 36:38.134
The tennis shoes
he begged--

36:38.185 --> 36:40.136
You know what
I'm talking about.

36:40.187 --> 36:41.688
I just didn't wear them.

36:41.722 --> 36:44.557
You realize I tell when people
are lying for a living?

36:44.559 --> 36:47.443
All right, Ray.
Let's talk about this later.

36:47.478 --> 36:49.946
Is that--
is that blood on your sleeve?

36:49.980 --> 36:51.564
What happened to your shoes?

36:51.566 --> 36:54.117
It was a little thing
that happened last week.

36:54.151 --> 36:56.202
Boys.

36:56.237 --> 36:57.787
What happened?

36:59.406 --> 37:02.492
What happened to your shoes?

37:02.543 --> 37:05.295
Ray, God damn it. They took his
shoes out of his gym locker.

37:05.379 --> 37:06.913
And what?
What, shit on them?

37:06.964 --> 37:08.248
They cut 'em up.
That's it.

37:08.299 --> 37:09.916
Christ, man, come on.
This isn't good for him.

37:09.918 --> 37:11.668
- Who was it, boy?
- Ray, stop it.

37:11.719 --> 37:14.304
- Let's talk later somewhere else.
- Jesus, God, you fat pussy.

37:14.338 --> 37:15.755
You're gonna give me
a kid's name right now

37:15.757 --> 37:17.307
or I'll pull down your pants
and I'll spank you

37:17.341 --> 37:18.808
in front of the fucking
cheerleading squad.

37:18.842 --> 37:22.428
Don't look at him!
You look at me!

37:22.479 --> 37:24.681
You tell me the name
of that kid, Chad.

37:25.683 --> 37:27.433
I'm gonna count to three.

37:27.484 --> 37:29.602
One, two--

37:29.653 --> 37:31.688
Aspen.
Aspen Conroy.

37:31.739 --> 37:34.607
Aspen?
That's a boy's name?

37:36.694 --> 37:39.379
- Chad.
- God damn it, Ray.

37:39.413 --> 37:41.331
What the hell
is the matter with you?

37:41.365 --> 37:43.533
Asshole.

37:43.617 --> 37:46.619
( breathing heavily )

37:46.621 --> 37:48.371
( sniffles )

37:48.422 --> 37:52.775
Ray:
We just had a-- a thing,

37:52.810 --> 37:55.178
me and you.

37:55.212 --> 37:58.798
Totally, totally my fault.

37:58.849 --> 38:00.466
<i>( horn honking )</i>

38:00.517 --> 38:04.470
Childhood is so scary.

38:07.641 --> 38:09.559
I used--

38:10.611 --> 38:12.895
I used to want
to be an astronaut.

38:18.986 --> 38:22.038
But astronauts don't even
go to the moon anymore.

38:23.157 --> 38:25.158
Dispatch:
<i>Detective Velcoro?</i>

38:32.666 --> 38:34.417
Yeah.

38:34.468 --> 38:36.736
<i>Yeah, got that Conroy
address you wanted.</i>

38:36.770 --> 38:38.871
<i>Place in Sherman Oaks.</i>

38:41.525 --> 38:42.975
Go.

38:43.010 --> 38:45.928
<i>Last name Conroy,</i>
<i>first name Wit.</i>

38:46.013 --> 38:47.397
<i>982...</i>

39:07.418 --> 39:09.786
And your pop,
he's a piece of work, huh?

39:09.870 --> 39:12.372
Don't talk about
my family, Elvis.

39:16.927 --> 39:19.178
( men chatting )

39:50.828 --> 39:52.412
Woman:
<i>Come on back, baby.</i>

39:52.463 --> 39:54.664
<i>I've got something for you.</i>

39:54.715 --> 39:56.999
<i>( TV playing in background )</i>

40:06.677 --> 40:09.595
It's been a week,
Mr. Policeman.

40:10.848 --> 40:13.015
Get that dick over here.

40:14.768 --> 40:17.603
Hold that thought.
I'm pretty rank.

40:17.605 --> 40:20.022
Let me jump in the shower.
I'm gonna get clean for you.

40:20.073 --> 40:21.741
I like it when you stink.
I don't mind.

40:21.775 --> 40:25.161
Five minutes
and I'll be right out.

40:25.195 --> 40:26.696
Can I soap you up?

40:26.747 --> 40:28.498
No, I like you the way you are.

40:29.583 --> 40:31.834
One hot shower,
I'm ready to go.

40:36.123 --> 40:38.040
I'm timing you,
Officer Woodrugh.

40:41.662 --> 40:42.595
<i>( door locks )</i>

40:42.663 --> 40:44.664
<i>( water running )</i>

41:19.216 --> 41:21.467
( sighs )

41:27.174 --> 41:30.309
- <i> ( TV continues playing )</i>
- <i> ( door opens, closes )</i>

41:33.480 --> 41:34.981
Jeez, that was like 30 minutes.

41:35.015 --> 41:36.983
I thought you had drowned.

41:37.017 --> 41:38.684
What took you so--

41:38.686 --> 41:40.903
It's been a long day.

41:40.938 --> 41:43.523
I had to work some kinks out.

41:43.607 --> 41:46.776
Well, I've got a place

41:46.827 --> 41:49.745
right here where you can
work that kink out.

42:05.212 --> 42:08.231
Osip, we talked
this through in Paris.

42:08.265 --> 42:10.299
Caspere's absence
don't mean a thing.

42:10.350 --> 42:12.051
It is happening, though.

42:12.053 --> 42:14.720
Vinci tapped fed money
from the subway line,

42:14.722 --> 42:16.472
and the same thing will happen

42:16.523 --> 42:19.308
on a much, much bigger scale
with the rail corridor.

42:19.359 --> 42:21.227
Owned by our holding companies.

42:21.311 --> 42:22.895
Set up through Catalast.

42:25.198 --> 42:28.568
This goes beyond us.
A legitimate legacy.

42:28.570 --> 42:32.738
Chance for the grandkids to be part of
one of those old California families.

42:32.789 --> 42:34.874
Don't even remember where
the money comes from.

42:36.710 --> 42:38.794
Let's talk more at dinner.

42:40.414 --> 42:42.748
Give us a minute, friends.

42:43.967 --> 42:45.585
( murmurs )

42:52.059 --> 42:54.677
<i>( door opens )</i>

42:56.730 --> 42:58.648
<i>( door closes )</i>

43:00.834 --> 43:03.519
I thought we already
had an agreement, Osip?

43:03.570 --> 43:08.024
Frank, you know you have
my complete confidence,

43:08.108 --> 43:11.410
but our organization
has very old rules.

43:11.445 --> 43:13.112
Checks and balances.

43:13.163 --> 43:15.748
I have to perform
my due diligence.

43:15.782 --> 43:18.668
Sure. Sure.

43:18.702 --> 43:21.721
But, Osip,
it's a buy-in.

43:21.755 --> 43:23.623
I thought you
were here to close.

43:23.625 --> 43:27.159
I will close
when I'm ready to close.

43:27.194 --> 43:28.794
Do not rush me, Frank.

43:35.769 --> 43:37.970
Sure.

43:37.972 --> 43:39.605
Yeah, of course.

43:40.807 --> 43:43.392
You guys should relax.

43:43.443 --> 43:45.361
Get some rest before dinner.

43:45.395 --> 43:47.313
I look forward
to meeting Caspere.

43:47.364 --> 43:49.115
( chuckles )

44:05.048 --> 44:06.999
<i>( door opens )</i>

44:08.385 --> 44:10.002
<i>( door closes )</i>

44:11.254 --> 44:14.006
Fuckin' Caspere.

44:14.057 --> 44:15.341
<i>( glass shatters )</i>

44:15.343 --> 44:17.677
<i>( dog barking )</i>

44:17.679 --> 44:19.979
Wit: What could you have
to talk to my son about?

44:20.013 --> 44:21.847
Relax, it's nothing.

44:21.898 --> 44:24.734
Maybe I just want to ask him
about some stolen property.

44:26.153 --> 44:27.987
Look, bud, you want
to call him out

44:28.021 --> 44:30.573
and maybe we can take care of
this, you know, right here?

44:30.607 --> 44:33.859
You don't even have
to tell the missus.

44:35.612 --> 44:37.947
- Yeah, hold on. Um...
- Great.

44:39.683 --> 44:42.201
<i>Hey, son? It'll just
be a second, honey.</i>

44:48.675 --> 44:51.093
<i>This man's with the police.</i>

44:51.128 --> 44:53.763
- He says he has something to ask you.
- ( chuckles )

44:53.797 --> 44:56.882
You like to bully kids,
Ass-pen.

44:56.933 --> 44:58.384
Hold on, what is this?

44:58.386 --> 45:00.803
You're 12 years old
and you're already evil as fuck.

45:00.854 --> 45:03.105
Hey, you can't talk--
( grunts )

45:04.524 --> 45:06.442
- No!
- You're gonna run out on your dad?

45:06.476 --> 45:09.845
Take a look.
He's doing this for you.

45:09.880 --> 45:12.865
- ( grunts )
- ( muffled shouting )

45:12.899 --> 45:15.484
( grunts )

45:16.787 --> 45:18.404
( groaning )

45:18.406 --> 45:20.656
Aspen:
Stop! Stop! Stop!

45:20.707 --> 45:23.125
- Stop!
- Stop? Stop?

45:23.160 --> 45:26.078
I thought that got you off, kid--
seeing people in pain.

45:26.129 --> 45:28.964
If you ever bully
or hurt anybody again,

45:28.999 --> 45:30.916
I'll come back
and butt-fuck your father

45:30.918 --> 45:33.586
with your mom's headless
corpse on this goddamn lawn.

45:33.637 --> 45:35.888
( whimpering )

45:37.758 --> 45:39.925
12 years old, my ass.

45:39.927 --> 45:42.394
Fuck you.

45:44.598 --> 45:47.066
- ( gurgling )
- ( Aspen crying )

45:52.239 --> 45:54.573
( tires squeal )

45:54.608 --> 45:55.775
Oh, my God, Wit!

45:55.826 --> 45:58.110
- ( woman gasps )
- ( engine revving )

46:50.797 --> 46:52.665
( sighs )

46:59.890 --> 47:02.424
What's this one?

47:02.475 --> 47:04.260
The big one.

47:09.282 --> 47:11.350
I know you don't like
talking about the army,

47:11.401 --> 47:13.402
but I keep wondering--

47:13.436 --> 47:15.688
It's not from the army.

47:15.722 --> 47:18.791
It's from before.

47:18.825 --> 47:20.893
A long time ago.

47:26.950 --> 47:29.535
- What are you doing?
- I'm working on something.

47:29.586 --> 47:32.087
Just got to check it out.

47:32.122 --> 47:34.006
How are you working
on something?

47:34.040 --> 47:36.008
- You're on leave.
- <i> It's a side job, babe.</i>

47:36.042 --> 47:38.444
Told a friend I'd help him out.

47:43.683 --> 47:45.768
That sounds like
bullshit, Paul.

47:47.053 --> 47:49.521
Hey, it's not.

47:49.556 --> 47:51.557
I swear.

47:54.060 --> 47:56.145
