00:20.813 --> 00:22.953
YOU WANT
SOME BREAKFAST?

00:22.988 --> 00:26.267
I WANT
SOME CORNFLAKES.

00:26.302 --> 00:28.683
CAN I HAVE SOME
OF YOUR CORNFLAKES?

00:28.718 --> 00:30.789
OH, I DON'T WANT NONE.
I WON'T TAKE NONE.

00:30.823 --> 00:32.722
I WON'T TAKE NONE.

00:32.756 --> 00:35.035
I WON'T EAT NONE
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.243
OOH! LOOK
AT THAT PRETTY HORSEY.

00:36.277 --> 00:38.176
WHERE?IS THAT A WHITE HORSE?

00:38.210 --> 00:40.523
SEE? NO. STAND UP,
LOOK OVER THERE.

00:40.557 --> 00:41.869
STAND UP.
YOU GOT TO STAND UP.

00:41.903 --> 00:43.250
OVER THAT BUILDING.

00:43.284 --> 00:45.114
SEE THE BIG ONE?
THERE HE IS.

00:49.325 --> 00:52.121
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

00:52.155 --> 00:53.294
YOU ATE
MY CORNFLAKES!

01:00.646 --> 01:03.201
MY EARLIEST MEMORIES
THAT I CAN THINK OF AS A CHILD

01:03.235 --> 01:06.480
WITH MY FATHER ARE WALKING
THROUGH AIRPORTS AND BEING

01:06.514 --> 01:09.103
IN CROWDS AND FEELING
IN MY--THE VIBRATIONS

01:09.138 --> 01:13.107
OF PEOPLE'S CLAPPING
AND SHOUTS IN MY CHEST

01:13.142 --> 01:14.798
AND JUST LOOKING
AT MY DAD, YOU KNOW, LIKE

01:14.833 --> 01:17.284
"WHO IS THIS PERSON?"

01:17.318 --> 01:20.149
AND IT WAS ALL THE TIME,
ANYWHERE WE WENT.

01:20.183 --> 01:21.633
"YOU'RE THE GREATEST.
WE LOVE YOU."

01:21.667 --> 01:23.152
AND THE CLAPPING
AND, "MUHAMMAD."

01:23.186 --> 01:25.464
ALI BOMAYE.
ALI BOMAYE.

01:25.499 --> 01:26.983
ALI BOMAYE.

01:27.017 --> 01:28.467
I LOVED FEELING
ALL THE ENERGY

01:28.502 --> 01:31.470
AND THE LOVE THAT HE FELT.

01:31.505 --> 01:35.923
WE NOW THINK
OF MUHAMMAD ALI AS
THIS VULNERABLE GUY

01:35.957 --> 01:37.752
LIGHTING THE TORCH IN ATLANTA,

01:37.787 --> 01:40.272
AND EVERYBODY
ON THE GLOBE LOVES HIM.

01:40.307 --> 01:42.412
BLACK PEOPLE LIKE HIM,
WHITE PEOPLE.

01:42.447 --> 01:46.313
HE'S A UNIVERSAL HERO LIKE--
BUT ALMOST IN A RELIGIOUS WAY,

01:46.347 --> 01:48.522
LIKE THE BUDDHA,
BUT WHEN HE WAS

01:48.556 --> 01:50.489
IN THE MIDST OF HIS CAREER
AND NOT JUST

01:50.524 --> 01:53.837
IN THE EARLY BIT,
HE WAS INCREDIBLY DIVISIVE.

01:53.872 --> 01:56.599
BOO, YELL,
SCREAM, THROW PEANUTS,

01:56.633 --> 02:00.534
BUT WHATEVER YOU DO,
PAY TO GET IN.

02:00.568 --> 02:02.674
PEOPLE HATED HIM
WHETHER IT WAS

02:02.708 --> 02:05.332
ALONG RACIAL LINES,
CLASS LINES, VIETNAM LINES,

02:05.366 --> 02:07.334
POLITICAL LINES,
RELIGIOUS LINES,

02:07.368 --> 02:08.990
OR THEY JUST COULDN'T STAND HIM

02:09.025 --> 02:10.440
AND PEOPLE OF COURSE
HAD THE OPPOSITE,

02:10.475 --> 02:14.134
AND THIS WAS
"I LOVED HIM, LOVED HIM!"

02:14.168 --> 02:17.206
BUT YOU HAD
AN OPINION ABOUT HIM.

02:18.828 --> 02:20.209
WHAT'S MY NAME?
WHAT'S MY NAME?

02:20.243 --> 02:21.831
I AIN'T SCARED
OF NO BATTLE.

02:21.865 --> 02:23.557
IT'S GONNA TAKE
A GOOD MAN TO WHOOP ME.

02:23.591 --> 02:24.799
YOU CAN LOOK AT ME.
I'M LOADED WITH CONFIDENCE.

02:24.834 --> 02:26.042
I CAN'T BE BEAT.

02:26.076 --> 02:27.457
I HAD 180 AMATEUR FIGHTS,

02:27.492 --> 02:28.493
22 PROFESSIONAL FIGHTS,

02:28.527 --> 02:30.150
AND I'M PRETTY AS A GIRL.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.875
LOOK HOW PRETTY I AM.

02:33.774 --> 02:36.156
MY LONG, TRIM LEGS
AND MY BEAUTIFUL ARMS

02:36.190 --> 02:37.743
AND MY PRETTY NOSE
AND MOUTH.

02:37.778 --> 02:40.056
I KNOW I'M PRETTY, MAN.
I KNOW I'M PRETTY.

02:40.090 --> 02:42.023
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TELL ME I'M PRETTY.

02:42.058 --> 02:43.508
I'M COCKY. I'M PROUD.

02:43.542 --> 02:45.579
NEVER TALK ABOUT
WHO'S GONNA STOP BE.

02:45.613 --> 02:47.097
THERE AIN'T NOBODY
GONNA STOP ME.

02:47.132 --> 02:48.892
I SAY WHAT A WANT TO SAY.

02:48.927 --> 02:50.170
THERE AIN'T NO MORE
BIG NIGGAS TALKING LIKE THIS.

02:51.757 --> 02:53.380
HE WAS A PIONEER,

02:53.414 --> 02:55.209
HE WAS A REVOLUTIONARY,

02:55.244 --> 02:57.591
HE WAS A GROUNDBREAKER,

02:57.625 --> 03:01.526
A GUY KNOWN SIMPLY
AS THE GREATEST.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.838
I AM THE GREATEST.

03:03.873 --> 03:05.323
I'VE WRASSLED
WITH ALLIGATORS.

03:05.357 --> 03:07.256
I'VE TUSSLED WITH A WHALE.

03:07.290 --> 03:10.397
I DONE HANDCUFFED LIGHTNING
AND PUT THUNDER IN JAIL.

03:10.431 --> 03:11.846
WELL, YOU KNOW I'M BAD.

03:11.881 --> 03:14.504
BACK OFF OF ME, MAN.
BACK OFF OF ME, MAN.

03:14.539 --> 03:17.887
I CAN DROWN A DRINK
OF WATER AND KILL A DEAD TREE.

03:17.921 --> 03:19.854
THIS WILL BE NO CONTEST.

03:19.889 --> 03:21.960
WAIT TILL YOU SEE MUHAMMAD ALI.

03:23.444 --> 03:25.412
TO HAVE THAT CHUTZPAH

03:25.446 --> 03:27.137
AND TO BE A BLACK MAN
IN AMERICA,

03:27.172 --> 03:29.692
IT WAS JUST--IT WAS--
IT WAS OUTLANDISH.

03:29.726 --> 03:31.418
MUHAMMAD MEANS WORTHY
OF ALL PRAISES,

03:31.452 --> 03:33.558
AND ALI MEANS MOST HIGH.

03:33.592 --> 03:36.423
I JUST DON'T THINK I SHOULD GO
10,000 MILES FROM HERE

03:36.457 --> 03:38.977
AND SHOOT SOME BLACK PEOPLE THAT
NEVER CALLED ME NIGGER.

03:39.011 --> 03:40.530
I JUST CAN'T SHOOT HIM.

03:40.565 --> 03:41.738
I WAS ALWAYS WONDERED
WHY MISS AMERICA

03:41.773 --> 03:42.774
WAS ALWAYS WHITE,

03:42.808 --> 03:44.051
SANTA CLAUSE IS WHITE.

03:44.085 --> 03:45.949
WHITE SWAN SOAP,
KING WHITE SOAP,

03:45.984 --> 03:47.641
WHITE CLOUD
TISSUE PAPER,

03:47.675 --> 03:49.367
AND EVERYTHING
BAD WAS BLACK.

03:49.401 --> 03:51.231
BLACK CAT WAS
THE BAD LUCK,

03:51.265 --> 03:54.061
AND IF I THREATEN YOU,
I'M GONNA BLACKMAIL YOU.

03:55.959 --> 03:57.444
I SAID, "MAMA, WHY DON'T
THEY CALL IT WHITEMAIL?

03:57.478 --> 03:58.962
THEY LIE, TOO."

03:58.997 --> 04:00.481
I LOVED BEING AROUND HIM.

04:00.516 --> 04:03.622
I LOVED
BEING AROUND MUHAMMAD ALI.

04:03.657 --> 04:06.591
YOU GONNA FLOAT
LIKE A BUTTERFLY
AND STING LIKE A BEE.

04:06.625 --> 04:08.178
AHH!

04:08.213 --> 04:10.146
RUMBLE, YOUNG MAN,
RUMBLE.

04:10.180 --> 04:11.596
AHH!

04:11.630 --> 04:13.080
THE PRICE OF
FREEDOM COMES HIGH.

04:13.114 --> 04:15.496
I HAVE PAID,
BUT I AM FREE.

04:20.121 --> 04:22.779
THE WINNER
AND STILL

04:22.814 --> 04:25.265
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD...

04:25.299 --> 04:29.199
I AM THE GREATEST
FIGHTER OF ALL TIME.

04:29.234 --> 04:32.030
OF ALL TIME.

04:44.249 --> 04:46.769
HE CALLED HIMSELF
"THE GREATEST"

04:46.803 --> 04:50.220
AND THEN PROVED IT
TO THE ENTIRE WORLD.

04:50.255 --> 04:53.983
HE WAS A MASTER AT WHAT IS
CALLED THE "SWEET SCIENCE,"

04:54.017 --> 04:58.608
THE BRUTAL AND SOMETIMES
BEAUTIFUL ART OF BOXING.

04:58.643 --> 05:01.611
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
AT JUST 22 YEARS OLD,

05:01.646 --> 05:05.339
HE WROTE HIS OWN RULES
IN THE RING AND IN HIS LIFE,

05:05.374 --> 05:09.136
INFURIATING HIS CRITICS,
BAFFLING HIS OPPONENTS,

05:09.170 --> 05:12.967
AND RIVETING MILLIONS OF FANS.

05:13.002 --> 05:15.142
AT THE HEIGHT
OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT,

05:15.176 --> 05:17.558
HE JOINED A SEPARATIST
RELIGIOUS SECT

05:17.593 --> 05:19.560
WHOSE LEADER WOULD,
FOR A TIME,

05:19.595 --> 05:24.220
DOMINATE BOTH HIS PERSONAL LIFE
AND HIS BOXING CAREER.

05:24.254 --> 05:27.188
HE SPOKE HIS MIND AND STOOD
ON PRINCIPLE

05:27.223 --> 05:30.744
EVEN WHEN IT COST HIM
HIS LIVELIHOOD.

05:30.778 --> 05:35.576
HE REDEFINED BLACK MANHOOD,
YET BELITTLED HIS GREATEST RIVAL

05:35.611 --> 05:38.372
USING THE RACIST LANGUAGE
OF THE JIM CROW SOUTH

05:38.407 --> 05:41.720
IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN RAISED.

05:41.755 --> 05:44.482
BANISHED FOR HIS BELIEFS,
HE RETURNED TO BOXING

05:44.516 --> 05:48.589
AN UNDERDOG, RECLAIMED
HIS TITLE TWICE,

05:48.624 --> 05:51.627
AND BECAME THE MOST FAMOUS MAN
ON EARTH.

05:53.076 --> 05:55.838
HE CRAVED ADULATION
HIS WHOLE LIFE,

05:55.872 --> 05:58.081
SEEKING CROWDS
ON STREET CORNERS,

05:58.116 --> 06:01.878
IN HOTEL LOBBIES,
ON AIRPORT TARMACS,

06:01.913 --> 06:03.915
EVERYWHERE HE WENT,

06:03.949 --> 06:06.780
AND REVELED
IN THE UNINHIBITED JOY

06:06.814 --> 06:10.508
HE BROUGHT EACH ADORING FAN.

06:10.542 --> 06:14.615
HE EARNED A MASSIVE FORTUNE,
SPENT IT FREELY,

06:14.650 --> 06:18.067
AND GAVE GENEROUSLY
TO FAMILY, FRIENDS,

06:18.101 --> 06:21.933
EVEN STRANGERS--ANYONE IN NEED.

06:21.967 --> 06:24.418
"SERVICE TO OTHERS,"
HE OFTEN SAID,

06:24.453 --> 06:29.596
"IS THE RENT YOU PAY
FOR YOUR ROOM HERE ON EARTH."

06:29.630 --> 06:32.253
EVEN AFTER HIS BODY BEGAN
TO BETRAY HIM

06:32.288 --> 06:37.120
AND HIS BRAIN HAD ABSORBED
TOO MANY BLOWS, HE FOUGHT ON,

06:37.155 --> 06:39.744
UNABLE TO GO WITHOUT
THE ATTENTION AND DRAMA

06:39.778 --> 06:42.160
THAT ACCOMPANIED EACH BOUT.

06:43.472 --> 06:48.442
LATER, SLOWED AND SILENCED BY
A CRUEL AND CRIPPLING DISEASE,

06:48.477 --> 06:52.101
HE FOUND REFUGE IN HIS FAITH,
BECOMING A SYMBOL

06:52.135 --> 06:56.416
OF PEACE AND HOPE
ON EVERY CONTINENT.

06:56.450 --> 07:00.074
MUHAMMAD ALI WAS, THE NOVELIST
NORMAN MAILER WROTE,

07:00.109 --> 07:04.078
"THE VERY SPIRIT
OF THE 20th CENTURY."

07:04.113 --> 07:06.460
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO
BE ONE BLACK ONE

07:06.495 --> 07:09.290
WHO GOT BIG
ON YOUR WHITE TELEVISIONS,

07:09.325 --> 07:11.776
ON YOUR WHITE NEWSPAPERS,
ON YOUR SATELLITES,

07:11.810 --> 07:14.641
MILLION-DOLLAR CHECKS,
AND STILL LOOK YOU IN YOUR FACE

07:14.675 --> 07:18.507
AND TELL YOU THE TRUTH AND 100%
STAY WITH AND REPRESENT

07:18.541 --> 07:21.199
MY PEOPLE AND NOT LEAVE
THEM AND SELL THEM OUT

07:21.233 --> 07:22.683
BECAUSE I'M RICH
AND STAY WITH THEM.

07:22.718 --> 07:24.374
THAT WAS MY PURPOSE.

07:24.409 --> 07:26.100
I'M HERE, AND I'M SHOWING
THE WORLD THAT

07:26.135 --> 07:29.379
YOU CAN BE HERE AND STILL FREE
AND STAY YOURSELF

07:29.414 --> 07:31.278
AND GET RESPECT FROM THE WORLD.

07:52.989 --> 07:56.855
MUHAMMAD ALI WAS BORN
CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY JR.

07:56.890 --> 08:02.551
AT LOUISVILLE CITY HOSPITAL
ON JANUARY 17, 1942.

08:02.585 --> 08:05.174
HE WEIGHED ABOUT
6 POUNDS, 1 OUNCE,

08:05.208 --> 08:08.695
SO I WOULDN'T CALL THAT
A VERY LARGE BABY.

08:08.729 --> 08:12.181
HE LEARNED TO TALK
BEFORE HE WAS ONE YEARS OLD,

08:12.215 --> 08:16.323
AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
A GREAT TALKER.

08:16.357 --> 08:18.739
HIS PARENTS,
ODESSA GRADY CLAY

08:18.774 --> 08:23.054
AND CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY SR.,
HAD MARRIED IN 1941

08:23.088 --> 08:26.989
AND BOUGHT A TINY HOUSE
AT 3302 GRAND AVENUE

08:27.023 --> 08:30.406
IN LOUISVILLE'S WEST END,
A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD

08:30.440 --> 08:34.341
THAT WAS HOME TO WORKING-
AND MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES.

08:34.375 --> 08:36.861
THE WEST END
HAD EVERYTHING.

08:36.895 --> 08:40.243
WE HAD OUR BANKS,
WE HAD OUR ENTREPRENEURS,

08:40.278 --> 08:41.831
WE HAD OUR NEWSPAPER.

08:41.866 --> 08:45.663
IT WAS A COMMUNITY
IN WHICH WE WERE SAFE.

08:45.697 --> 08:49.874
I DON'T HAVE A RECOLLECTION
OF WHEN I FIRST MET THE CLAYS.

08:49.908 --> 08:53.533
IT'S ALMOST AS
IF YOU ALWAYS KNEW THEM.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.708
MRS. CLAY, SHE LOVED EVERYBODY
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

08:56.743 --> 08:58.883
I MEAN, SHE WAS ONE
OF THE ONES THAT

08:58.917 --> 09:01.264
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED
YOU ALWAYS KNEW

09:01.299 --> 09:03.681
THAT YOU COULD RUN OVER THERE.

09:03.715 --> 09:06.787
ODESSA COOKED
AND CLEANED FOR WHITE FAMILIES

09:06.822 --> 09:09.238
AND ATTENDED
MOUNT ZION BAPTIST CHURCH

09:09.272 --> 09:10.964
EVERY SUNDAY.

09:10.998 --> 09:12.241
MOMMA BIRD,
MY GRANDMOTHER,

09:12.275 --> 09:13.932
WAS VERY SWEET, VERY QUIET,

09:13.967 --> 09:16.486
AND VERY PLEASANT,
NEVER SPOKE BADLY ABOUT ANYBODY,

09:16.521 --> 09:18.558
VERY POSITIVE,
SPIRITUAL WOMAN.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.214
SO OUTGOING AND LOVING.

09:20.249 --> 09:23.804
SHE WAS KIND,
AND SHE WAS JUST SINCERE,

09:23.839 --> 09:27.221
AND MY DAD TRULY RECEIVED
HIS GENTLENESS

09:27.256 --> 09:31.156
AND HIS KINDNESS FROM HIS
MOM, MOMMA BIRD.

09:31.191 --> 09:33.262
YOUNG
CASSIUS NEVER SAT STILL.

09:33.296 --> 09:35.402
HE PULLED THE POTS AND PANS
FROM THE CUPBOARD

09:35.436 --> 09:37.784
TO BANG ON THEM,
CHASED THE FAMILY'S PET CHICKEN

09:37.818 --> 09:40.994
AROUND THE YARD,
AND STOOD UP IN HIS STROLLER

09:41.028 --> 09:42.961
TO GET A BETTER VIEW.

09:42.996 --> 09:45.619
EVEN AS A YOUNG BOY,
HE JUST HAD

09:45.654 --> 09:48.277
THIS HUGE PERSONALITY,
AND HE WAS ALWAYS LAUGHING

09:48.311 --> 09:50.728
AND SMILING, ALWAYS MAKING
OTHER PEOPLE LAUGH.

09:50.762 --> 09:52.626
AND MY GRANDMOTHER, SHE WAS
LIKE, "THIS--THIS BOY

09:52.661 --> 09:55.525
IS GONNA BE SOMETHING SPECIAL."

09:55.560 --> 09:58.114
18 MONTHS
AFTER CASSIUS WAS BORN,

09:58.149 --> 10:00.358
ODESSA GAVE BIRTH
TO A SECOND SON, WHOM THEY NAMED

10:00.392 --> 10:05.294
AFTER THE SILENT FILM
STAR RUDOLPH VALENTINO.

10:05.328 --> 10:08.469
CASSIUS AND RUDY WERE
EXCEPTIONALLY CLOSE.

10:08.504 --> 10:11.334
WHEN HIS BROTHER MISBEHAVED,
CASSIUS WOULD INSIST

10:11.369 --> 10:14.614
THAT RUDY WAS HIS BABY
AND REFUSE TO LET

10:14.648 --> 10:18.307
THEIR FATHER SPANK HIM.

10:18.341 --> 10:21.310
CASSIUS CLAY SR.,
AN ARTIST WHO EARNED A LIVING

10:21.344 --> 10:23.968
AS A SIGN-PAINTER
AND MURALIST, HAD BEEN NAMED

10:24.002 --> 10:28.489
FOR A FIERY 19th CENTURY
WHITE ABOLITIONIST.

10:28.524 --> 10:32.010
HE LOVED TO BE NOTICED,
OFTEN QUOTED FROM THE BIBLE,

10:32.045 --> 10:35.773
AND RAILED
AGAINST RACIAL INJUSTICE.

10:35.807 --> 10:38.879
"CASH," AS HE WAS CALLED,
WAS "A MINIATURE VOLCANO

10:38.914 --> 10:42.987
OF A MAN," ONE OBSERVER SAID,
BOISTEROUS AND COCKY.

10:43.021 --> 10:46.507
PAPA CASH
WAS CHARISMATIC, HE WAS FUNNY,

10:46.542 --> 10:50.063
HE HAD THE BIGGEST PERSONALITY.

10:50.097 --> 10:53.307
HE LIT UP A ROOM
WHEN HE WALKED IN.

10:53.342 --> 10:55.793
EVERYONE JUST WANTED TO TALK
TO HIM,

10:55.827 --> 10:57.587
EVERYONE WANTED TO KNOW HIM.

10:57.622 --> 11:01.074
OUR FATHER COULD SING,
DANCE, PAINT, DRAW,

11:01.108 --> 11:02.592
MEMORIZE POETRY.

11:02.627 --> 11:05.078
MY BROTHER GOT HIS TALENT
FROM OUR FATHER.

11:05.112 --> 11:07.908
MY DAD, HE'S CERTAINLY
A COMBINATION OF MOMMA BIRD

11:07.943 --> 11:09.703
AND PAPA CASH FOR SURE,

11:09.738 --> 11:13.707
BUT HIS CHARISMA DEFINITELY
CAME FROM PAPA CASH.

11:13.742 --> 11:15.675
HIS FATHER WAS A RACE MAN,

11:15.709 --> 11:18.367
AND HE BELIEVED THAT HIS CAREER,
LIKE SO MANY OTHERS',

11:18.401 --> 11:20.265
WAS HELD BACK
BY THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN,

11:20.300 --> 11:23.268
AND HE BELIEVED THAT
HE WAS A BRILLIANT PAINTER,

11:23.303 --> 11:25.339
AN ARTIST,
BUT HE WAS RELEGATED

11:25.374 --> 11:27.238
TO PAINTING SIGNS
IN FRONT OF STORES

11:27.272 --> 11:30.586
AND PAINTING CHURCH MURALS
AND SCRAPING TO MAKE A LIVING

11:30.620 --> 11:33.175
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME
KIND OF OPPORTUNITY

11:33.209 --> 11:35.384
THAT A WHITE PAINTER
MIGHT HAVE HAD.

11:35.418 --> 11:38.732
PAPA CASH WAS ALSO
AN UNREPENTANT WOMANIZER,

11:38.767 --> 11:40.941
WHO COULD BE VIOLENT WHEN DRUNK.

11:40.976 --> 11:43.772
HE WAS ARRESTED REGULARLY
FOR DISORDERLY CONDUCT

11:43.806 --> 11:45.532
AND RECKLESS DRIVING.

11:45.566 --> 11:48.293
AND HE OCCASIONALLY HIT
HIS WIFE,

11:48.328 --> 11:51.469
AND THERE WERE POLICE INVOLVED
AT TIMES WHEN SHE HAD TO CALL

11:51.503 --> 11:53.643
TO PROTECT HERSELF,

11:53.678 --> 11:55.749
AND I THINK FOR
THE BOYS GROWING UP,

11:55.784 --> 11:58.925
FOR CASSIUS AND FOR RUDY,
IT WAS FRIGHTENING ENVIRONMENT

11:58.959 --> 12:01.134
AT TIMES TO SEE THEIR MOTHER
BEING THREATENED,

12:01.168 --> 12:03.653
AND AS THEY GOT OLDER,
THEY WOULD STEP IN

12:03.688 --> 12:05.586
AND TRY TO PUT A STOP TO IT.

12:05.621 --> 12:08.106
AFTER ONE INCIDENT,
POLICE ARRIVED

12:08.141 --> 12:10.626
AT THE CLAY HOME TO FIND
YOUNG CASSIUS

12:10.660 --> 12:12.801
WITH A BLOODY GASH ON HIS LEG.

12:12.835 --> 12:15.389
HIS FATHER HAD CUT HIM
WITH A KNIFE WHEN HE'D TRIED

12:15.424 --> 12:17.322
TO PROTECT HIS MOTHER
DURING AN ARGUMENT

12:17.357 --> 12:19.497
BETWEEN HIS PARENTS.

12:19.531 --> 12:22.569
THE OFFICERS DID NOTHING.

12:22.603 --> 12:24.813
DESPITE THE VIOLENCE,
CASSIUS AND RUDY

12:24.847 --> 12:28.955
WOULD SPEAK OF THEIR HOME LIFE
AS PEACEFUL AND HAPPY.

12:35.513 --> 12:37.480
MY FATHER, COMING UP,
IN THE SEGREGATED SOUTH,

12:37.515 --> 12:41.415
IN LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY,
HAD A DIFFICULT TIME.

12:41.450 --> 12:43.452
MOMMA BIRD TAUGHT HIM,
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE CRUEL

12:43.486 --> 12:45.695
IN THIS WORLD,
BUT NEVER, NEVER, NEVER,

12:45.730 --> 12:47.456
YOU KNOW, BECOME THAT.

12:47.490 --> 12:49.147
I PLEDGE
ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG

12:49.182 --> 12:51.805
OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.911
THE LOUISVILLE
OF CASSIUS CLAY'S YOUTH

12:53.945 --> 12:56.948
WAS STRICTLY SEGREGATED,
AND OPPORTUNITIES

12:56.983 --> 12:59.640
FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS
WERE LIMITED.

12:59.675 --> 13:02.782
HE ATTENDED ALL-BLACK SCHOOLS,
COULD NOT EAT

13:02.816 --> 13:05.819
AT THE LUNCH COUNTERS
OF DOWNTOWN STORES,

13:05.854 --> 13:08.270
AND WATCHED FROM THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE FENCE

13:08.304 --> 13:13.516
AS WHITE FAMILIES ENJOYED
A NEARBY AMUSEMENT PARK.

13:13.551 --> 13:16.278
YOUNG CASSIUS CLAY
WAS AWARE VERY EARLY

13:16.312 --> 13:18.038
OF THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE

13:18.073 --> 13:20.489
AND HOW DIFFERENTLY HE AND HIS
FAMILY WERE TREATED

13:20.523 --> 13:23.112
AND WOULD ASK HIS FATHER,
"WHY CAN'T I BE RICH?"

13:23.147 --> 13:25.805
AND HIS FATHER WOULD JUST POINT
TO THE COLOR OF HIS SKIN

13:25.839 --> 13:28.048
AND SAY, "THAT'S
WHY YOU CAN'T BE RICH."

13:32.535 --> 13:35.642
IN 1955,
NEWS OF THE BRUTAL TORTURE

13:35.676 --> 13:38.231
AND MURDER OF 14-YEAR-OLD
EMMETT TILL

13:38.265 --> 13:41.510
BY WHITE MEN IN MISSISSIPPI
AND GRAPHIC IMAGES

13:41.544 --> 13:44.237
IN "JET" MAGAZINE
OF HIS MUTILATED FACE

13:44.271 --> 13:46.411
HAUNTED CASSIUS CLAY,

13:46.446 --> 13:50.243
WHO WAS JUST 6 MONTHS
YOUNGER THAN TILL.

13:50.277 --> 13:52.383
THAT REALLY AFFECTED LIKE
A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE

13:52.417 --> 13:54.143
IN THAT TIME.

13:54.178 --> 13:56.318
HE SAW HIMSELF IN EMMETT TILL
AND THOUGHT, "WOW!

13:56.352 --> 13:58.009
"THIS OUTGOING KID
FROM THE CITY,

13:58.044 --> 13:59.769
"AND HE CAME, AND HE WHISTLED
AT A PRETTY LADY,

13:59.804 --> 14:01.150
"AND NOW HE'S DEAD,
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN

14:01.185 --> 14:03.014
RECOGNIZE HIS FACE."

14:05.706 --> 14:07.398
IT WAS ASTONISHING
WHEN WE FOUND OUT

14:07.432 --> 14:09.883
ABOUT EMMETT TILL.

14:09.918 --> 14:12.852
HIS MOTHER SAID,
"LEAVE THE CASKET OPEN,"

14:12.886 --> 14:15.613
AND YOU COULD SEE WHAT,
HOW THEY BRUTALIZED HIM,

14:15.647 --> 14:19.272
AND SO EVERYBODY SAW THAT.

14:19.306 --> 14:21.584
IT WAS REALLY KIND OF
SCARY FOR EVERYBODY

14:21.619 --> 14:24.277
IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE
IF THEY COULD DO THAT TO HIM,

14:24.311 --> 14:27.521
WHAT COULD THEY DO TO US?

14:27.556 --> 14:31.111
THAT'S WHEN YOUNG BLACK GUYS
STARTED TO CHANGE.

14:37.152 --> 14:39.085
AT THE VIRGINIA AVENUE
COLORED SCHOOL,

14:39.119 --> 14:42.398
CASSIUS CLAY HAD A HARD TIME
PAYING ATTENTION.

14:42.433 --> 14:44.090
HE STRUGGLED
WITH HIS CLASSES.

14:44.124 --> 14:46.126
HE STRUGGLED TO READ,
HE STRUGGLED WITH MATH.

14:46.161 --> 14:48.646
HE WAS MOST CERTAINLY DYSLEXIC.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.890
HE FOUND, LIKE A LOT
OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE TROUBLE

14:50.924 --> 14:53.133
IN SCHOOL, THAT HE HAD TO
COMPENSATE,

14:53.168 --> 14:56.412
AND BY BEING THE CLASS CLOWN
WAS THE WAY HE DID THAT.

14:56.447 --> 14:58.587
HE WOULD CARRY A PURSE
TO SCHOOL,

14:58.621 --> 15:01.072
HE WORE LIPSTICK ONE DAY
TO GET LAUGHS.

15:01.107 --> 15:03.592
HE WAS WILLING TO DO THINGS
THAT BOYS IN THE 1950s

15:03.626 --> 15:06.112
DIDN'T OFTEN DO.

15:06.146 --> 15:07.768
EVEN AS A YOUNG MAN,
PEOPLE JUST LOVED

15:07.803 --> 15:09.287
TO BE AROUND HIM.

15:09.322 --> 15:12.773
HE MADE THEM FEEL
GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES.

15:12.808 --> 15:15.466
ONE DAY
IN OCTOBER OF 1954,

15:15.500 --> 15:17.744
12-YEAR-OLD CASSIUS RODE
HIS BICYCLE

15:17.778 --> 15:19.435
INTO DOWNTOWN LOUISVILLE,

15:19.470 --> 15:22.680
WHILE RUDY SAT
ON THE HANDLEBARS.

15:22.714 --> 15:25.165
IT BEGAN TO RAIN,
AND THE BOYS TOOK COVER

15:25.200 --> 15:28.306
IN THE COLUMBIA AUDITORIUM,
WHERE A HOME APPLIANCE SHOW

15:28.341 --> 15:31.413
WAS UNDERWAY.

15:31.447 --> 15:33.794
AFTER THE RAIN STOPPED,
THEY EMERGED TO FIND THAT

15:33.829 --> 15:35.865
THE BICYCLE WAS GONE.

15:35.900 --> 15:39.007
HE HAD A BRAND-NEW SCHWINN,
A BEAUTIFUL RED BICYCLE

15:39.041 --> 15:41.526
THAT HE SHARED WITH HIS BROTHER,

15:41.561 --> 15:43.149
AND HE WENT RUNNING AROUND
LOOKING FOR HIS BICYCLE

15:43.183 --> 15:44.978
AND THEN RAN BACK
INTO THE COMMUNITY CENTER

15:45.013 --> 15:46.600
ASKING FOR HELP.

15:46.635 --> 15:47.843
SOMEONE TOLD HIM THERE
WAS A POLICE OFFICER

15:47.877 --> 15:49.465
IN THE BASEMENT.

15:53.883 --> 15:55.885
HE WENT DOWN,
AND THE COP IN THE BASEMENT

15:55.920 --> 16:00.028
WAS THIS JOE MARTIN, WHO WAS
RUNNING A LITTLE BOXING SCHOOL.

16:00.062 --> 16:02.340
CASSIUS TOLD THE STORY
YEARS LATER THAT

16:02.375 --> 16:03.963
FOR A MINUTE HE FORGOT
ABOUT HIS BIKE

16:03.997 --> 16:06.620
BECAUSE THE SIGHT
OF THIS BOXING GYM,

16:06.655 --> 16:08.657
THE SMELL OF THE LEATHER
AND THE SWEAT,

16:08.691 --> 16:10.970
AND THE EXCITEMENT,
THE ACTION OF BOYS

16:11.004 --> 16:12.109
IN A RING HITTING EACH OTHER,

16:12.143 --> 16:14.007
BLACK AND WHITE, TOGETHER.

16:14.042 --> 16:17.114
AND HE, YOU KNOW, REPORTED
THE CRIME, AND "I'M GONNA

16:17.148 --> 16:19.530
GET THE GUY AND I'M GONNA,"
YOU KNOW, "KILL HIM."

16:19.564 --> 16:21.532
AND JOE MARTIN SAID,
"WELL, UH, DO YOU KNOW

16:21.566 --> 16:23.844
HOW TO FIGHT?"

16:23.879 --> 16:25.018
"FIGHT?"

16:25.053 --> 16:27.124
AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING.

16:27.158 --> 16:28.918
THOUGH HIS FATHER
WAS RELUCTANT TO LET

16:28.953 --> 16:31.197
HIS SON TRAIN
WITH A WHITE POLICE OFFICER,

16:31.231 --> 16:34.890
THE LESSONS WERE FREE,
AND CASSIUS WAS EAGER TO LEARN.

16:34.924 --> 16:38.549
AT FIRST, THE YOUNG BOXER
DID NOT IMPRESS MARTIN.

16:38.583 --> 16:41.172
"HE WAS JUST ORDINARY,"
THE TRAINER RECALLED,

16:41.207 --> 16:43.071
"AND I DOUBT WHETHER ANY SCOUT
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

16:43.105 --> 16:45.038
MUCH OF HIM."

16:45.073 --> 16:47.178
CASSIUS DIDN'T SHOW ANY
SPECIAL TALENT RIGHT AWAY,

16:47.213 --> 16:49.008
BUT HE SHOWED ENORMOUS PASSION.

16:49.042 --> 16:52.321
HE KNEW INSTANTLY THAT THIS
WAS WHAT HE WANTED TO DO.

16:52.356 --> 16:54.013
BOXING WAS PERFECT FOR HIM
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST

16:54.047 --> 16:56.946
TWO GUYS IN THE RING,
AND YOUR EYES ARE ALWAYS

16:56.981 --> 16:58.707
GOING TO BE DRAWN NATURALLY TO
THE ONE WHO'S DOING

16:58.741 --> 17:01.227
THE MOST MOVING, WHO'S DOING
THE MOST PUNCHING,

17:01.261 --> 17:03.539
WHO'S MOVING THE FASTEST,
AND THAT WAS HIM,

17:03.574 --> 17:06.887
AND HE KNEW THAT HE COULD GET
THE MOST ATTENTION THAT WAY.

17:06.922 --> 17:10.236
JUST 6 WEEKS AFTER
HE WALKED INTO JOE MARTIN'S GYM,

17:10.270 --> 17:13.722
CASSIUS CLAY HAD HIS FIRST
AMATEUR FIGHT.

17:13.756 --> 17:16.207
I AT THAT TIME WAS PUTTING
ON A LOCAL TELEVISION SHOW

17:16.242 --> 17:18.761
HERE IN LOUISVILLE,
AND I HAD AMATEUR BOUTS

17:18.796 --> 17:21.902
EVERY SATURDAY AFTERNOON,
AND THE FIRST BOUT I PUT HIM IN,

17:21.937 --> 17:24.388
HE WEIGHED 87 POUNDS.

17:24.422 --> 17:26.976
AFTER DEFEATING
14-YEAR-OLD RONNIE O'KEEFE

17:27.011 --> 17:29.703
IN A SPLIT DECISION,
CLAY IMMEDIATELY ANNOUNCED

17:29.738 --> 17:32.534
TO EVERYONE THAT ONE DAY
HE WOULD BE CALLED

17:32.568 --> 17:35.261
"THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME."

17:35.295 --> 17:36.986
HE WAS ALWAYS BEEN
A LITTLE BRAGGART,

17:37.021 --> 17:38.264
"I'M THE GREATEST" AND ALL THAT,
BEFORE HE EVEN GOT

17:38.298 --> 17:40.093
TO BE THE GREATEST.

17:40.128 --> 17:43.234
WE'D SAY, "OH, SHUT UP.
YOU'RE JUST RUNNING YOUR MOUTH."

17:43.269 --> 17:45.478
BUT AS HE GOT BETTER AND BETTER,

17:45.512 --> 17:47.790
WE HAD MORE RESPECT FOR HIM.

17:47.825 --> 17:50.207
HE BELIEVES IN HIMSELF
BEFORE THERE'S ANY REASON TO,

17:50.241 --> 17:51.415
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE IS
TELLING HIM THAT HE

17:51.449 --> 17:53.417
MIGHT EVEN HAVE TALENT.

17:53.451 --> 17:56.282
IT'S SO PREPOSTEROUS.

17:56.316 --> 17:58.284
CASSIUS THREW
HIMSELF INTO TRAINING,

17:58.318 --> 18:01.218
DETERMINED TO ADD MUSCLE
TO HIS SLENDER FRAME.

18:01.252 --> 18:04.807
HE STOPPED DRINKING SODA POP
AND SUBSTITUTED GARLIC WATER,

18:04.842 --> 18:07.396
WHICH HE BELIEVED WOULD KEEP
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE DOWN.

18:08.984 --> 18:10.675
CASSIUS CLAY
OF LOUISVILLE

18:10.710 --> 18:12.298
IN THE TRUNKS
WITH THE WHITE STRIPES,

18:12.332 --> 18:15.508
MEETS JEFFERSON DAVIS
OF MOBILE, ALABAMA.

18:15.542 --> 18:18.683
CLAY REALIZED EARLY
THAT HE WAS UNUSUALLY QUICK

18:18.718 --> 18:22.031
AND AGILE, ABLE TO AVOID
PUNCHES BY LEANING BACK

18:22.066 --> 18:24.448
RATHER THAN DUCKING
OR SLIPPING SIDE TO SIDE

18:24.482 --> 18:27.244
AS BOXERS WERE
INSTRUCTED TO DO.

18:28.866 --> 18:29.867
IT'S CASSIUS
CLAY THE WINNER

18:29.901 --> 18:31.317
OVER JEFFERSON DAVIS.

18:34.734 --> 18:37.357
SOME NIGHTS, CLAY
WENT FROM MARTIN'S GYM

18:37.392 --> 18:40.705
TO THE GRACE COMMUNITY CENTER
ACROSS TOWN, WHERE HE CONTINUED

18:40.740 --> 18:43.984
HIS BOXING EDUCATION
UNDER FRED STONER,

18:44.019 --> 18:47.609
A VETERAN TRAINER WHO HAD GUIDED
MANY LOCAL AMATEURS TO SUCCESS

18:47.643 --> 18:50.129
AT THE GOLDEN GLOVES.

18:50.163 --> 18:53.166
AWAY FROM THE GYM,
HE SOUGHT BOXING WISDOM

18:53.201 --> 18:55.858
WHEREVER HE COULD FIND IT.

18:55.893 --> 18:59.655
WHEN THE WELL-KNOWN TRAINER
ANGELO DUNDEE CAME TO TOWN,

18:59.690 --> 19:02.382
CASSIUS PEPPERED
HIM WITH QUESTIONS.

19:02.417 --> 19:05.074
DUNDEE WAS IMPRESSED
BY THE TEENAGER'S DETERMINATION

19:05.109 --> 19:07.215
AND AMBITION.

19:07.249 --> 19:09.044
HE WANTED TO FIND OUT
HOW FIGHTERS TRAIN,

19:09.078 --> 19:12.012
THE BUSINESS ABOUT, UH,
DIET, AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

19:12.047 --> 19:14.981
AND HE WAS VERY, VERY
CURIOUS AT THAT TIME.

19:15.015 --> 19:17.190
BEFORE EACH FIGHT,
CASSIUS CLAY WOULD GO

19:17.225 --> 19:19.710
DOOR TO DOOR ACROSS
LOUISVILLE, INTRODUCING

19:19.744 --> 19:22.989
HIMSELF TO WHITE
AND BLACK RESIDENTS ALIKE.

19:23.023 --> 19:25.233
HIS STRATEGY WAS
TO SELL TICKETS,

19:25.267 --> 19:27.994
AND ANY WAY I COULD
ENTERTAIN AND SELL TICKETS,

19:28.028 --> 19:30.065
THIS IS WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO,

19:30.099 --> 19:31.480
AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID.

19:31.515 --> 19:34.034
HE DID A REAL GOOD
JOB AT THAT.

19:34.069 --> 19:36.209
CLAY WAS OFTEN
ABSENT FROM HIGH SCHOOL,

19:36.244 --> 19:38.763
COMPETING
IN AMATEUR TOURNAMENTS.

19:38.798 --> 19:41.939
WHEN HE DID ATTEND CLASS,
HE SKETCHED BOXING GLOVES

19:41.973 --> 19:44.321
AND LETTER JACKETS STITCHED

19:44.355 --> 19:46.840
WITH "NATIONAL GOLDEN GLOVES
CHAMPION" IN HIS NOTEBOOK

19:46.875 --> 19:50.119
AND OFFERED TO SIGN AUTOGRAPHS
FOR HIS CLASSMATES.

19:53.571 --> 19:55.918
BET MY CLASSMATES THAT I
WOULD BEAT THEM TO SCHOOL.

19:55.953 --> 19:58.438
THEY WOULD RIDE THE BUS.

19:58.473 --> 20:00.440
HE WOULD RUN UP
CHESTNUT STREET

20:00.475 --> 20:05.238
WITH THE LOCAL TRANSIT BUS
JUST TO GET HIMSELF CONDITIONED

20:05.273 --> 20:06.964
AND THEN RUN
FROM CHESTNUT STREET

20:06.998 --> 20:11.140
TO ALL THE WAY OVER
TO BROADWAY AND COME BACK,

20:11.175 --> 20:13.246
AND HE WOULD SOMETIMES STOP
TO LOOK TO SEE

20:13.281 --> 20:14.903
IF THERE WERE LADIES IN THERE
OR WHATEVER,

20:14.937 --> 20:18.389
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
AND KEEP ON RUNNING.

20:18.424 --> 20:20.564
THE BUS MIGHT GET
A BLOCK OR TWO LEAD ON ME.

20:20.598 --> 20:22.600
I WOULD ALWAYS CATCH UP TO
IT WHEN IT STOPPED

20:22.635 --> 20:24.775
FOR PASSENGERS OR STOPPED
FOR A RED LIGHT

20:24.809 --> 20:26.397
OR SOMETHING.

20:26.432 --> 20:27.950
IT WAS FUNNY.
IT WAS REALLY FUNNY,

20:27.985 --> 20:30.953
AND HE'D WAVE,
WAVE, "I'M GOING ON."

20:30.988 --> 20:32.092
THEY'D SAY,
"HE'S A STRANGE PERSON.

20:32.127 --> 20:35.164
WHY'S HE RUNNING WITH US?"

20:35.199 --> 20:37.477
IN FEBRUARY OF 1958,

20:37.512 --> 20:39.652
A MONTH AFTER HIS 16th BIRTHDAY,

20:39.686 --> 20:41.447
CLAY TRAVELED WITH JOE MARTIN

20:41.481 --> 20:43.725
AND A GROUP OF LOUISVILLE
HOPEFULS TO CHICAGO

20:43.759 --> 20:46.555
FOR THE GOLDEN GLOVES
TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS.

20:46.590 --> 20:50.007
IT WAS HIS FIRST
NATIONAL COMPETITION.

20:50.041 --> 20:54.011
HE LOST IN THE QUARTER FINALS.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.945
ONE YEAR LATER,
TALLER AND HEAVIER,

20:56.979 --> 20:58.947
HE MADE IT TO THE TOURNAMENT
FINALS,

20:58.981 --> 21:02.985
WHERE HE DEFEATED 29-YEAR-OLD
AUSTRALIAN-BORN TONY MADIGAN,

21:03.020 --> 21:07.024
A TWO-TIME OLYMPIAN,
WHO WAS FAVORED TO WIN.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.164
THE DECISION
WAS UNANIMOUS.

21:09.198 --> 21:11.200
"I COULDN'T STICK
HIM," MADIGAN SAID.

21:11.235 --> 21:13.582
"HE WOULD ALWAYS JUST
PULL OUT OF RANGE...

21:13.617 --> 21:15.722
SORT OF VANISH INTO THIN AIR."

21:17.897 --> 21:20.589
CASSIUS CLAY WAS NOW
A GOLDEN GLOVES

21:20.624 --> 21:24.110
LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION.

21:24.144 --> 21:26.354
A WIN AT THE NATIONAL
OLYMPIC TRIALS

21:26.388 --> 21:29.598
IN SAN FRANCISCO WOULD EARN HIM
A SPOT ON THE TEAM HEADED

21:29.633 --> 21:32.981
FOR THE 1960 ROME OLYMPICS,

21:33.015 --> 21:35.155
BUT THERE WAS A PROBLEM.

21:35.190 --> 21:37.468
HE WAS AFRAID OF FLYING,

21:37.503 --> 21:40.782
SO AFRAID THAT HE CONSIDERED
TURNING PROFESSIONAL

21:40.816 --> 21:44.233
RATHER THAN COMPETE FOR A CHANCE
TO GO TO ITALY.

21:44.268 --> 21:46.788
HE HATED FLYING. HE WAS SCARED
TO DEATH OF AIRPLANES.

21:46.822 --> 21:48.617
HE ACTUALLY FLEW TO
THE OLYMPIC TRIALS

21:48.652 --> 21:50.826
WITH A PARACHUTE THAT HE
BOUGHT AT AN ARMY-NAVY STORE

21:50.861 --> 21:52.621
THAT HE WORE ON THE PLANE.

22:00.491 --> 22:02.873
AT THE COW PALACE
IN SAN FRANCISCO,

22:02.907 --> 22:05.979
CLAY DEFEATED HIS FIRST
TWO OPPONENTS CONVINCINGLY

22:06.014 --> 22:08.810
AND ADVANCED TO THE FINALS,
WHERE HE FACED

22:08.844 --> 22:13.366
ALLEN HUDSON, AN ARMY VETERAN
AND MORE EXPERIENCED FIGHTER.

22:13.401 --> 22:15.264
IN THE 178-POUND CLASS,

22:15.299 --> 22:17.991
ANOTHER LOUISVILLE BOY
CASSIUS CLAY IN THE DARK TRUNKS

22:18.026 --> 22:22.755
IS PITTED AGAINST THE ALL-ARMY
CHAMPION ALLEN HUDSON.

22:22.789 --> 22:24.998
IN THE THIRD ROUND,
HUDSON SENT CLAY

22:25.033 --> 22:27.932
TO THE CANVAS.

22:27.967 --> 22:29.727
CASSIUS IS
UP ALMOST IMMEDIATELY,

22:29.762 --> 22:32.868
AND AFTER A CHECK BY THE REF,
HE'S BACK IN ACTION.

22:32.903 --> 22:35.112
CLAY'S CHANCE TO GO TO WORK.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.045
HE WADES INTO HUDSON
AND SENDS HIM REELING

22:37.079 --> 22:39.254
INTO THE CORNER.

22:43.879 --> 22:47.158
HUDSON IS REALLY GROGGY
AND JUST ABOUT OUT ON HIS FEET.

22:50.127 --> 22:54.614
THE REFEREE AWARDED
CLAY A TECHNICAL KNOCKOUT.

22:54.649 --> 22:56.202
HE HAD EARNED A SPOT

22:56.236 --> 23:00.033
ON THE UNITED STATES
OLYMPIC TEAM.

23:00.068 --> 23:02.588
AFTER THE TRIALS,
CLAY PAWNED A WATCH HE'D WON

23:02.622 --> 23:05.522
IN THE TOURNAMENT
AND BOUGHT A TRAIN TICKET HOME

23:05.556 --> 23:08.594
SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO FLY.

23:08.628 --> 23:10.561
HIS GRADUATION FROM
CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL

23:10.596 --> 23:12.908
WAS NOW JUST WEEKS AWAY.

23:12.943 --> 23:16.636
HE'D MISSED SO MANY DAYS
AND HAD SUCH POOR GRADES

23:16.671 --> 23:21.054
THAT MANY OF HIS TEACHERS FELT
CLAY DID NOT DESERVE A DIPLOMA.

23:21.089 --> 23:23.436
HIS PRINCIPAL DISAGREED.

23:23.471 --> 23:25.783
"THE ONLY THING CASSIUS
IS GOING TO HAVE TO READ

23:25.818 --> 23:28.614
IS HIS IRS FORM," HE SAID,
"AND I'M WILLING

23:28.648 --> 23:30.443
TO HELP HIM DO IT."

23:32.928 --> 23:35.241
ON HIS WAY
TO THE OLYMPICS IN ROME,

23:35.275 --> 23:38.347
CASSIUS CLAY FIRST STOPPED
IN NEW YORK, WHERE HE HOPED TO

23:38.382 --> 23:41.178
MEET HIS IDOL,
FORMER MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMPION

23:41.212 --> 23:44.561
SUGAR RAY ROBINSON, WHOM
MANY BELIEVED THE GREATEST

23:44.595 --> 23:47.633
POUND-FOR-POUND FIGHTER
IN BOXING HISTORY,

23:47.667 --> 23:49.945
KNOWN AS MUCH
FOR HIS FLASHY STYLE

23:49.980 --> 23:53.466
AS FOR HIS PROWESS IN THE RING.

23:53.501 --> 23:56.676
WHILE CLAY WAITED OUTSIDE
ROBINSON'S HARLEM RESTAURANT,

23:56.711 --> 23:59.265
HOPING FOR A MOMENT
WITH HIS HERO,

23:59.299 --> 24:01.370
HE NOTICED A SMALL CROWD
GATHERED

24:01.405 --> 24:03.372
AROUND A WELL-DRESSED ORATOR,

24:03.407 --> 24:04.995
WHO WAS CALLING UPON
BLACK PEOPLE

24:05.029 --> 24:08.481
TO SHOP ONLY
AT BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES.

24:08.516 --> 24:12.761
THE MAN BELONGED TO A GROUP
CALLED THE NATION OF ISLAM.

24:12.796 --> 24:15.523
"HOW CAN HE TALK LIKE THAT?"
CLAY WONDERED.

24:15.557 --> 24:18.491
"AIN'T HE GONNA GET IN TROUBLE?"

24:18.526 --> 24:22.495
WHEN SUGAR RAY FINALLY PULLED UP
IN A PURPLE LINCOLN CONTINENTAL,

24:22.530 --> 24:26.499
HE HAD LITTLE TIME FOR HIS YOUNG
ADMIRER, HURRIEDLY SIGNING

24:26.534 --> 24:29.778
A PHOTOGRAPH FOR CLAY
AND WISHING HIM LUCK.

24:29.813 --> 24:32.367
AT FIRST, CLAY WAS AWESTRUCK.

24:32.401 --> 24:35.474
"THAT SUGAR RAY,
HE'S SOMETHING," HE RAVED.

24:35.508 --> 24:38.166
"SOMEDAY I'M GOING TO OWN
TWO CADILLACS

24:38.200 --> 24:41.652
AND A FORD FOR JUST GETTING
AROUND IN,"

24:41.687 --> 24:45.173
BUT LATER, HE REMEMBERED,
HE FELT SNUBBED.

24:45.207 --> 24:47.520
"IF I EVER GET GREAT
AND FAMOUS AND PEOPLE WANT

24:47.555 --> 24:50.143
MY AUTOGRAPH ENOUGH TO WAIT
ALL DAY," HE SAID,

24:50.178 --> 24:53.043
"I'M SURE GONNA TREAT
THEM DIFFERENT."

24:53.077 --> 24:55.666
THEN, HE NERVOUSLY FLEW TO ROME.

25:02.949 --> 25:05.227
THE 1960 OLYMPICS WERE
BIG AND EXCITING

25:05.262 --> 25:07.229
IN A LOT OF WAYS.

25:08.610 --> 25:11.095
THE AMERICAN TEAM WAS
LED BY RAFER JOHNSON.

25:13.063 --> 25:15.790
IT WAS A VERY EXCITING TIME
TO BE AN OLYMPIAN.

25:17.067 --> 25:19.897
FOR CASSIUS, WHO'D REALLY
NEVER TRAVELED VERY FAR,

25:19.932 --> 25:22.348
THIS WAS REALLY
AN EYE-OPENER TO SEE THE WORLD

25:22.382 --> 25:25.454
AND TO SEE PEOPLE WHO
SPOKE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES,

25:25.489 --> 25:26.904
AND HE INSTANTLY BECAME

25:26.939 --> 25:28.527
THE MAYOR
OF THE OLYMPIC VILLAGE.

25:28.561 --> 25:31.184
HE WAS NOT FAMOUS YET
IN ANY WAY,

25:31.219 --> 25:34.015
BUT HIS MAGNETISM
JUST WAS AMAZING,

25:34.049 --> 25:37.570
AND YOU SEE INSTANTLY REPORTERS
AND OTHER ATHLETES SAYING,

25:37.605 --> 25:40.124
"WHO IS THIS GUY?
WE NEED TO TALK TO HIM,"

25:40.159 --> 25:43.403
AND JUST CLUSTERS FORMING
AROUND HIM WHEREVER HE WENT.

25:43.438 --> 25:45.923
CLAY REVELED
IN ALL THE ATTENTION.

25:45.958 --> 25:47.856
HE MET BING CROSBY,

25:47.891 --> 25:51.135
FLIRTED WITH THE SPRINTER
WILMA RUDOLPH,

25:51.170 --> 25:53.310
AND POSED FOR PHOTOGRAPHS

25:53.344 --> 25:56.313
WITH THE CURRENT HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION FLOYD PATTERSON.

25:56.347 --> 25:59.868
"BE SEEING YOU IN
ABOUT TWO MORE YEARS," HE SAID.

25:59.903 --> 26:02.906
"THIS KID IS IRRESISTIBLE,"
WROTE ONE REPORTER.

26:02.940 --> 26:06.979
"HE EVEN MADE FRIENDS
WITH THE RUSSIANS."

26:07.013 --> 26:08.946
THE OLYMPIC ATHLETE
WITH THE NOBLEST ROMAN NAME

26:08.981 --> 26:11.604
OF THEM ALL
IS CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY.

26:11.639 --> 26:14.400
ACTUALLY, CASSIUS IS NO
ROMAN AT ALL, HOWEVER.

26:14.434 --> 26:16.816
HE'S ACTUALLY AN 18-YEAR-OLD
LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT,

26:16.851 --> 26:18.956
WHO MAKES HIS HOME ON
GRAND STREET

26:18.991 --> 26:20.924
IN LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY,
AND HE MAY VERY WELL BECOME

26:20.958 --> 26:23.478
AN OLYMPIC CHAMPION.

26:23.512 --> 26:24.893
CASSIUS CLAY--

26:24.928 --> 26:26.654
HE'S AMERICA'S
LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT.

26:26.688 --> 26:28.794
NO ONE OUTSIDE OF THE STATES
HAS EVER HEARD OF HIM.

26:28.828 --> 26:32.107
CLAY BEATS A BELGIAN,
A RUSSIAN, AND AN AUSTRALIAN,

26:32.142 --> 26:35.317
AND NOW HE'S IN THE FINAL.

26:35.352 --> 26:37.423
HIS OPPONENT FOR
THE GOLD MEDAL WOULD BE

26:37.457 --> 26:41.082
ZIGZY PIETRZYKOWSKI FROM POLAND,
WHO'D WON OLYMPIC BRONZE

26:41.116 --> 26:43.671
4 YEARS EARLIER.

26:43.705 --> 26:45.431
THE POLE IS 25.

26:45.465 --> 26:46.950
HE'S BEEN UNBEATEN CHAMPION

26:46.984 --> 26:48.952
OF EUROPE FOR 5 YEARS.

26:48.986 --> 26:50.160
FOR TWO ROUNDS,

26:50.194 --> 26:52.852
THE MEN MEASURED EACH OTHER.

26:52.887 --> 26:54.923
CLAY, A RATHER
DECEPTIVE, CASUAL WAY

26:54.958 --> 26:57.823
OF THROWING PUNCHES,
AND HE PUNCHES VERY HARD.

27:04.346 --> 27:07.108
IN THE THIRD
AND FINAL ROUND,

27:07.142 --> 27:10.870
CLAY TOOK COMMAND.

27:10.905 --> 27:12.665
OH.

27:12.700 --> 27:15.806
GOOD SHOT BY CLAY THEN.

27:15.841 --> 27:19.085
LOOKS LIKE PIETRZYKOWSKI'S
BLEEDING FROM THE MOUTH A BIT.

27:22.710 --> 27:24.884
PIETRZYKOWSKI
NOW DEFINITELY BLEEDING OUT

27:24.919 --> 27:28.647
THE NOSE AND MOUTH
RATHER HEAVILY.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.444
THERE'S THE END OF THE FIGHT.

27:37.172 --> 27:39.692
CASSIUS CLAY
HAD WON THE ULTIMATE PRIZE

27:39.727 --> 27:41.349
IN AMATEUR BOXING.

27:56.778 --> 27:59.816
HE FLEW BACK TO NEW YORK,
WHERE A LOUISVILLE MILLIONAIRE

27:59.850 --> 28:03.716
PAID FOR THE BOXER'S SUITE
AT THE WALDORF TOWERS HOTEL

28:03.751 --> 28:05.822
AND GAVE HIM A ROLL OF BILLS,

28:05.856 --> 28:08.169
WHICH HE USED
TO DINE ON STEAKS AND BUY

28:08.203 --> 28:12.863
EXPENSIVE WATCHES
FOR HIS BROTHER AND PARENTS.

28:12.898 --> 28:15.417
LATER, DECKED
OUT IN HIS GOLD MEDAL

28:15.452 --> 28:18.869
AND OLYMPIC BLAZER,
CLAY VISITED TIMES SQUARE,

28:18.904 --> 28:21.734
WHERE HE PAID TO HAVE A NOVELTY
NEWSPAPER PRINTED UP

28:21.769 --> 28:25.704
WITH THE HEADLINE "CASSIUS
SIGNS FOR PATTERSON FIGHT,"

28:25.738 --> 28:28.189
TRIED HIS FIRST SLICE
OF CHEESECAKE,

28:28.223 --> 28:31.226
AND AT BIRDLAND,
A POPULAR JAZZ CLUB, ASKED

28:31.261 --> 28:36.093
THE BARTENDER FOR A COKE
WITH A SINGLE DROP OF WHISKEY.

28:36.128 --> 28:39.062
EVERYWHERE HE WENT,
WELL-WISHERS PRAISED HIM

28:39.096 --> 28:41.236
FOR HIS SUCCESS IN ROME.

28:44.826 --> 28:47.484
AT LOUISVILLE'S AIRPORT,
HUNDREDS OF FANS WERE THERE

28:47.518 --> 28:49.624
TO GREET HIM.

28:53.421 --> 28:54.767
CASSIUS, YOU'VE
HEARD IT A GOOD MANY TIMES

28:54.802 --> 28:56.286
TODAY ALREADY HERE
AT THE AIRPORT,

28:56.320 --> 28:57.943
BUT CONGRATULATIONS.THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

28:57.977 --> 29:00.566
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THAT REAL
GOLD MEDAL THERE.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.982
CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY JR.

29:03.017 --> 29:06.883
WAS JUST 18,
BUT HE'D FOUGHT MORE THAN 100

29:06.917 --> 29:13.165
AMATEUR BOUTS AND WAS READY
TO TURN PROFESSIONAL.

29:13.199 --> 29:14.407
DEMPSEY HERDS
HIM ALONG THE ROPES,

29:14.442 --> 29:16.064
BEATING AWAY WITH BOTH HANDS.

29:16.099 --> 29:17.686
WATCH, WATCH.

29:17.721 --> 29:20.931
THERE'S THAT BIG LEFT,
AND WILLARD'S DOWN.

29:20.966 --> 29:22.657
PROFESSIONAL BOXING
HAD LONG BEEN

29:22.691 --> 29:26.316
AMONG THE MOST POPULAR SPORTS
IN AMERICA.

29:26.350 --> 29:29.250
THE APPEAL
OF BOXING IS BASIC.

29:29.284 --> 29:32.805
I MEAN, IT'S MAN AGAINST MAN,

29:32.840 --> 29:36.671
IT'S BRUTAL,
IT'S BLOOD SPORT.

29:36.705 --> 29:38.811
IT WILL ALWAYS BE HERE,

29:38.846 --> 29:42.470
AND IT WILL ALWAYS
HAVE PEOPLE WATCHING.

29:42.504 --> 29:44.265
EVERYBODY KNEW
WHO THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION

29:44.299 --> 29:47.026
OF THE WORLD WAS
IN THE WAY THAT YOU KNOW WHO

29:47.061 --> 29:49.201
THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES IS,

29:49.235 --> 29:51.962
AND YOU KNEW
HIS PERSONALITY,

29:51.997 --> 29:53.722
WHAT HE REPRESENTED,

29:53.757 --> 29:56.208
WHAT HE PROJECTED
INTO THE WORLD.

29:56.242 --> 29:58.348
JOHN L. SULLIVAN,

29:58.382 --> 30:00.039
JIM JEFFRIES,

30:00.074 --> 30:01.938
JACK JOHNSON,

30:01.972 --> 30:04.147
JACK DEMPSEY.

30:04.181 --> 30:05.976
ONE OF THE GREATEST...

30:06.011 --> 30:07.840
JOE LOUIS HAD LIFTED
THE SPIRITS

30:07.875 --> 30:09.186
OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS
EVERYWHERE...

30:09.221 --> 30:10.705
AND SCHMELING
IS DOWN!

30:10.739 --> 30:12.500
WHEN HE SEIZED
THE HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE

30:12.534 --> 30:15.123
IN THE MIDST OF
THE GREAT DEPRESSION

30:15.158 --> 30:19.403
AND HELD IT FOR A DOZEN YEARS,

30:19.438 --> 30:23.373
BUT BY THE 1950S, GANGSTERS
RAN THE SPORT,

30:23.407 --> 30:25.858
TARNISHING ITS REPUTATION.

30:25.893 --> 30:27.687
BOXING WAS KIND
OF AN ANARCHY IN MANY WAYS.

30:27.722 --> 30:29.862
YOU HAD THE OFFICIAL
LICENSING ORGANIZATIONS

30:29.897 --> 30:31.553
THAT RAN THE SPORT,
BUT THERE WAS

30:31.588 --> 30:33.176
NO REAL GOVERNANCE TO IT AT ALL,

30:33.210 --> 30:36.041
AND IT WAS OFTEN CONTROLLED
BY MAFIA FIGURES,

30:36.075 --> 30:38.008
PEOPLE WHO WOULD FIX FIGHTS,

30:38.043 --> 30:39.907
PEOPLE WHO WOULD EXTRACT
HUGE SUMS OF MONEY

30:39.941 --> 30:42.392
FROM THEIR FIGHTERS AND LEAVE
THEM NOT JUST WRECKED

30:42.426 --> 30:45.257
PHYSICALLY BUT BROKE.

30:45.291 --> 30:47.086
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT
WAS ALMOST INEVITABLE

30:47.121 --> 30:48.916
FOR BOXERS THAT THEY WERE
GOING TO GET INVOLVED

30:48.950 --> 30:50.849
IN THIS UNDERWORLD
AND THAT TO MAKE IT

30:50.883 --> 30:52.885
IN THE SPORT YOU ALMOST
HAD TO ASSOCIATE

30:52.920 --> 30:56.337
WITH THOSE CHARACTERS.

30:56.371 --> 30:58.546
BOXING INSIDERS
SAW THAT CLAY COULD BE

30:58.580 --> 31:01.790
A BIG MONEY MAKER
IN THE HEAVYWEIGHT DIVISION.

31:01.825 --> 31:03.896
CUS D'AMATO,
FLOYD PATTERSON'S

31:03.931 --> 31:06.623
SAVVY CORNER MAN,
OFFERED TO TRAIN HIM.

31:06.657 --> 31:10.592
SO DID FORMER HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION ROCKY MARCIANO.

31:10.627 --> 31:12.629
"IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE
AN EXCELLENT MANAGER,"

31:12.663 --> 31:15.390
THE VETERAN FIGHTER
ARCHIE MOORE CABLED,

31:15.425 --> 31:18.566
"CALL ME TONIGHT."

31:18.600 --> 31:21.362
THEN WILLIAM FAVERSHAM,
AN EXECUTIVE

31:21.396 --> 31:24.020
AT A LOUISVILLE DISTILLERY,
FORMED A SYNDICATE

31:24.054 --> 31:26.229
OF 11 PROMINENT
WHITE BUSINESSMEN

31:26.263 --> 31:27.886
WITH DEEP KENTUCKY ROOTS.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.819
I'M BILL FAVERSHAM.I'M W. LYONS BROWN.

31:30.854 --> 31:32.787
J.D. STETSON COLEMAN.

31:32.821 --> 31:34.927
THEY AGREED TO POOL
THEIR MONEY TO LAUNCH

31:34.962 --> 31:38.931
CLAY'S CAREER AND SHIELD
HIM FROM THE MOB.

31:38.966 --> 31:41.106
CASSIUS CLAY WAS OFFERED
THE GREATEST CONTRACT

31:41.140 --> 31:42.797
IN THE HISTORY OF BOXING.

31:42.831 --> 31:44.247
IT WAS A COMPLETE ANOMALY.

31:44.281 --> 31:46.076
THERE WAS NOTHING
LIKE IT EVER BEFORE,

31:46.111 --> 31:48.734
AND IN FACT, THE LAWYER WHO
WROTE THE CONTRACT SAID

31:48.768 --> 31:50.494
HE HAD TO GO OUTSIDE
THE INDUSTRY.

31:50.529 --> 31:52.945
HE WENT TO HOLLYWOOD
AND LOOKED FOR CONTRACTS THAT

31:52.980 --> 31:55.396
WERE GIVEN TO CHILD ACTORS
TO SEE HOW THEY COULD

31:55.430 --> 31:57.639
BEST BE PROTECTED.

31:57.674 --> 32:00.332
WE OFFERED HIM
A $10,000 BONUS

32:00.366 --> 32:02.230
FOR SIGNING A CONTRACT.

32:02.265 --> 32:04.474
THIS CONTRACT, RAN FOR
TWO YEARS,

32:04.508 --> 32:06.234
WHERE WE PAID HIM A SALARY

32:06.269 --> 32:08.478
BECAUSE AFTER ALL, WE DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT HE COULD EARN.

32:08.512 --> 32:10.100
BOXERS DIDN'T GET SALARIES.

32:10.135 --> 32:11.964
A MONTHLY SALARY FOR BOXING?

32:11.999 --> 32:15.830
WE WANTED TO GUARANTEE HIM SOME
FORM OF SECURITY.

32:15.864 --> 32:20.007
AT THE SAME TIME,
HE ALSO GOT 50% OF HIS PURSES.

32:20.041 --> 32:21.146
WE'RE GONNA PAY ALL
HIS EXPENSES,

32:21.180 --> 32:22.285
WE'RE GONNA PAY HIS MEALS,

32:22.319 --> 32:23.665
WE'RE GONNA PAY HIS RENT,

32:23.700 --> 32:24.839
WE'RE GONNA PAY
FOR HIS TRAINING.

32:24.873 --> 32:25.874
WE'RE GOING TO SET IT UP SO THAT

32:25.909 --> 32:27.428
THERE ARE TAX DEDUCTIONS.

32:27.462 --> 32:28.532
THERE HAD NEVER BEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT

32:28.567 --> 32:30.017
IN BOXING.

32:30.051 --> 32:31.363
THEY HOPED TO
SEE A RETURN

32:31.397 --> 32:32.985
ON THEIR INVESTMENT,

32:33.020 --> 32:34.780
BUT AS ONE MEMBER REMARKED,

32:34.814 --> 32:37.369
THEY WERE IN IT "TO DO SOMETHING
NICE FOR A DESERVING,

32:37.403 --> 32:40.717
"WELL-BEHAVED LOUISVILLE BOY,
AND TO SAVE HIM

32:40.751 --> 32:45.032
FROM THE JAWS
OF THE HOODLUM JACKALS."

32:45.066 --> 32:48.000
CLAY USED HIS BONUS
TO BUY THE CADILLAC

32:48.035 --> 32:51.521
HE HAD COVETED SINCE
HE WAS A BOY,

32:51.555 --> 32:54.696
THOUGH HE HADN'T BOTHERED TO GET
A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

32:57.009 --> 33:01.565
ON OCTOBER 29, 1960, CLAY
MADE HIS PROFESSIONAL DEBUT

33:01.600 --> 33:04.741
AT LOUISVILLE'S FREEDOM HALL.

33:04.775 --> 33:07.019
THEY FOUND A GUY IN
THE HILLS OF WEST VIRGINIA.

33:07.054 --> 33:08.745
HIS NAME IS TUNNEY HUNSAKER,

33:08.779 --> 33:11.299
AND TUNNEY HUNSAKER
WAS A SHERIFF

33:11.334 --> 33:13.370
AND A STRAIGHT-ARROW GUY.

33:13.405 --> 33:15.407
HE HAD THE WORLD WAR I
CAMPAIGN HAT THAT

33:15.441 --> 33:18.030
STATE TROOPERS WORE
IN MANY STATES,

33:18.065 --> 33:21.482
AND HE SAID HE WOULD FIGHT HIM.

33:21.516 --> 33:25.762
IT WAS AN INEXPERIENCED FIGHTER
AGAINST A BAD FIGHTER.

33:25.796 --> 33:28.351
CLAY PUMMELED
HUNSAKER FOR 6 ROUNDS

33:28.385 --> 33:30.353
AND EARNED
A UNANIMOUS DECISION,

33:30.387 --> 33:33.494
BUT MANY IN ATTENDANCE FELT THAT
HE SHOULD HAVE KNOCKED OUT

33:33.528 --> 33:36.014
THE SLOW-MOVING POLICEMAN.

33:36.048 --> 33:39.155
HIS SPONSORS KNEW HE WOULD
NEED A FIRST-CLASS TRAINER

33:39.189 --> 33:41.191
IF HE WAS EVER GOING TO CONTEND

33:41.226 --> 33:43.849
FOR THE HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPIONSHIP.

33:46.783 --> 33:49.337
THEY DECIDED TO HIRE
ARCHIE MOORE, WHO TAUGHT

33:49.372 --> 33:53.893
YOUNG FIGHTERS AT HIS CAMP
IN THE HILLS EAST OF SAN DIEGO.

33:53.928 --> 33:58.036
MOORE PREACHED
DISCIPLINE AND PATIENCE.

33:58.070 --> 34:02.764
MOORE ALSO DEMANDED THAT
THEY COOK, CLEAN, CHOP WOOD,

34:02.799 --> 34:06.389
AND HELP MAINTAIN
THE GROUNDS.

34:06.423 --> 34:09.944
IT WAS KNOWN AS THE SALT MINE.

34:09.978 --> 34:13.085
CASSIUS CLAY SAID,
"I'M HERE TO BE A FIGHTER,

34:13.120 --> 34:14.949
"NOT TO BE THE JANITOR.

34:14.983 --> 34:16.813
THEY'RE PAYING
YOU GOOD MONEY."

34:16.847 --> 34:18.918
SO, ARCHIE MOORE SAID,
"WELL, YOU'RE PRETTY COCKY,

34:18.953 --> 34:20.886
"YOU GOT TO KNOW HUMILITY.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.958
IF YOU DON'T HAVE HUMILITY,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ANYTHING."

34:23.992 --> 34:26.478
CLAY BRISTLED
AT MOORE'S DEMANDS,

34:26.512 --> 34:30.792
AND HE WAS AFRAID MOORE
INTENDED TO CHANGE HIS STYLE.

34:30.827 --> 34:34.244
AFTER ONLY A FEW WEEKS,
HE WAS SENT HOME.

34:36.143 --> 34:39.111
WILLIAM FAVERSHAM OF
THE LOUISVILLE SPONSORING GROUP

34:39.146 --> 34:41.389
THEN CALLED ANGELO DUNDEE,

34:41.424 --> 34:44.082
THE MIAMI BEACH-BASED TRAINER
CLAY HAD MET

34:44.116 --> 34:47.257
IN LOUISVILLE BACK IN 1957.

34:47.292 --> 34:50.640
DUNDEE WAS KNOWN FOR HIS
CALM DEMEANOR DURING FIGHTS

34:50.674 --> 34:53.746
AND HIS GIFT FOR PATCHING
UP BLOODIED BOXERS.

34:53.781 --> 34:57.612
HE WAS WELL-LIKED
AND AT 39 HAD ALREADY TRAINED

34:57.647 --> 35:00.132
6 WORLD CHAMPIONS.

35:00.167 --> 35:03.687
CLAY, HE HAD BEEN TOLD,
SHOWED REAL POTENTIAL

35:03.722 --> 35:08.175
BUT WAS OVERCONFIDENT
AND WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO TEACH.

35:08.209 --> 35:11.350
DUNDEE REMEMBERED
THE ENTHUSIASTIC TEENAGER

35:11.385 --> 35:14.042
AND AGREED TO TAKE CLAY ON.

35:14.077 --> 35:16.148
HE TOLD FAVERSHAM TO
SEND HIS FIGHTER DOWN

35:16.183 --> 35:18.357
AFTER CHRISTMAS.

35:18.392 --> 35:21.291
"ANGELO," FAVERSHAM SAID,
"CASSIUS WANTS A FIGHT

35:21.326 --> 35:23.328
BEFORE CHRISTMAS."

35:28.367 --> 35:30.956
ON DECEMBER 19, 1960,

35:30.990 --> 35:33.372
AFTER A TWO-DAY JOURNEY
BY TRAIN,

35:33.407 --> 35:35.443
CASSIUS CLAY ARRIVED IN MIAMI,

35:35.478 --> 35:38.653
WHERE HIS NEW TRAINER
GREETED HIM AT THE STATION.

35:41.069 --> 35:44.659
DUNDEE DROVE CLAY TO OVERTOWN,
A SEGREGATED NEIGHBORHOOD

35:44.694 --> 35:47.524
WHERE BLACK VISITORS
WHO WERE REFUSED SERVICE

35:47.559 --> 35:51.528
AT MIAMI'S "WHITES ONLY" HOTELS
COULD RENT A ROOM.

35:54.669 --> 35:57.396
AT THE MARY ELIZABETH HOTEL,
A HUB FOR PIMPS

35:57.431 --> 36:00.365
AND DRUG DEALERS,
CLAY WAS TO SHARE A DINGY ROOM

36:00.399 --> 36:02.712
WITH ONE DOUBLE BED
AND NO AIR CONDITIONING

36:02.746 --> 36:05.059
WITH A JAMAICAN HEAVYWEIGHT.

36:07.682 --> 36:10.237
THE NEXT MORNING, CLAY
REPORTED TO DUNDEE'S

36:10.271 --> 36:13.481
5th STREET GYM IN MIAMI BEACH.

36:19.591 --> 36:21.248
NOT YET!

36:21.282 --> 36:23.353
5th STREET GYM
WAS JUST A WALKUP,

36:23.388 --> 36:28.772
OLD PUBLIC BOXING GYM THAT CLAY
FIRST WENT TO WHEN HE WAS 18.

36:28.807 --> 36:33.846
CRICKETY STAIRS, RUM-ADDLED
DRUNKS LAYING ON THE STEPS

36:33.881 --> 36:36.780
THAT YOU HAD TO WALK OVER
TO GET UPSTAIRS.

36:36.815 --> 36:39.024
THE GYM WAS HOME
TO BLACK, WHITE,

36:39.058 --> 36:42.752
AND CUBAN BOXERS, ALL TOILING
UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYES

36:42.786 --> 36:46.445
OF A RAGTAG CREW
OF REGULARS ONE WRITER DUBBED

36:46.480 --> 36:48.930
THE "PUGILISTIC COLLEGE
OF CARDINALS,"

36:48.965 --> 36:54.212
WHO STOOD RINGSIDE AND APPRAISED
DUNDEE'S TRAINEES.

36:54.246 --> 36:56.731
NONE WAS IMPRESSED WITH CLAY.

36:56.766 --> 36:59.251
"HE KEEPS HIS HANDS TOO LOW,"
THEY AGREED.

36:59.286 --> 37:01.529
"HE'S OFF BALANCE
WHEN HE PUNCHES,

37:01.564 --> 37:04.222
HE'S A HEADHUNTER."

37:04.256 --> 37:08.156
THE CUBANS CALLED HIM
"NIÑO CON BOCA GRANDE"--

37:08.191 --> 37:11.159
THE KID WITH THE BIG MOUTH.

37:11.194 --> 37:14.784
ANGELO DUNDEE ALSO SAW
A FLAWED FIGHTER

37:14.818 --> 37:17.614
BUT ONE WITH EXCEPTIONAL
HAND AND FOOT SPEED

37:17.649 --> 37:21.377
AND A TIRELESS WORK ETHIC,
AND HE WAS SURE

37:21.411 --> 37:25.173
HE COULD HELP SMOOTH CLAY'S
ROUGH EDGES.

37:25.208 --> 37:28.280
YOU CAN'T DIRECTLY
TELL HIM, "DO THIS."

37:28.315 --> 37:30.248
THIS IS A CARDINAL SIN.

37:30.282 --> 37:31.973
SAY THIS WORKOUT TODAY.

37:32.008 --> 37:34.459
I'LL GO OVER AND TELL HIM,
"GEE, THAT WASN'T TOO BAD

37:34.493 --> 37:36.012
"FOR THE FIRST DAY.

37:36.046 --> 37:37.427
"YOUR JAB WASN'T AS SHARP
AS I'D LIKE IT,

37:37.462 --> 37:39.187
BUT A REAL GOOD JAB."

37:39.222 --> 37:40.603
WELL, THUSLY, THE NEXT DAY
HE'LL BE USING HIS JAB

37:40.637 --> 37:42.674
MORE EFFECTIVELY,

37:42.708 --> 37:44.296
BUT IF I TELL HIM "YOUR JAB
IS TERRIBLE,"

37:44.331 --> 37:46.678
THEN I'D BE HITTING
THE WRONG KIND OF A NOTE.

37:46.712 --> 37:50.854
YOU GOT TO WORK
ON HIM PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

37:50.889 --> 37:52.649
OTHER TRAINERS MIGHT
HAVE INSISTED THAT

37:52.684 --> 37:55.687
"YOU FIGHT MY WAY,"
BUT ANGELO WAS SMART ENOUGH,

37:55.721 --> 37:57.205
GENIUS ENOUGH REALLY,

37:57.240 --> 37:59.829
TO JUST LET HIM BE AND GUIDE HIM

37:59.863 --> 38:02.452
RATHER THAN TEACH HIM.

38:02.487 --> 38:05.283
EACH DAY, CLAY
ROSE BEFORE DAWN,

38:05.317 --> 38:08.803
LACED ON A PAIR OF ARMY BOOTS,
AND DID HIS ROADWORK.

38:13.705 --> 38:16.466
HE RAN THE STREETS
AND CAUSEWAYS OF OVERTOWN,

38:16.501 --> 38:20.988
AT TIMES BACKWARDS,
SHADOWBOXING AS HE WENT.

38:21.022 --> 38:25.441
THEN HE JOGGED THE 4 1/2 MILES
FROM NORTH MIAMI TO 5th STREET,

38:25.475 --> 38:28.513
WHERE, WHILE CLIMBING THE STAIRS
TO THE SECOND FLOOR,

38:28.547 --> 38:32.310
HE SOMETIMES ANNOUNCED
HIS ARRIVAL BY HOLLERING,

38:32.344 --> 38:35.209
"ANGELO, LINE UP ALL YOUR BUMS.

38:35.243 --> 38:38.246
I'M GONNA KNOCK THEM ALL OUT."

38:38.281 --> 38:40.835
IN THE GYM, HE'D HIT
THE SPEED BAG,

38:40.870 --> 38:43.735
THEN THE HEAVY BAG,
DO HIS CALISTHENICS

38:43.769 --> 38:45.392
BEFORE A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR,

38:45.426 --> 38:47.704
AND SPAR WITH OTHER
YOUNG FIGHTERS,

38:47.739 --> 38:50.983
INCREASING HIS STAMINA
WHILE DUNDEE CAREFULLY COAXED

38:51.018 --> 38:56.195
HIM INTO REFINING HIS BEST
PUNCH, THE JAB.

38:56.230 --> 38:58.646
THE EARLY CASSIUS TOOK
FROM RAY ROBINSON.

38:58.681 --> 39:01.269
RAY ROBINSON WAS A DANCER.

39:01.304 --> 39:05.377
CASSIUS, LIKE EXPANDED
THE, UH, NOTION OF DANCING.

39:05.412 --> 39:10.175
TYPICALLY A BOXER IS TAUGHT
TO STAY IN THE POCKET

39:10.209 --> 39:13.074
AND PARRY A PUNCH.

39:13.109 --> 39:14.869
THIS GUY WOULD DO SOMETHING

39:14.904 --> 39:16.492
THAT IT'S LIKE SACRILEGE
IN BOXING.

39:16.526 --> 39:19.598
YOU DON'T LEAN BACK, MAN,
BUT HE LEANED BACK.

39:19.633 --> 39:21.911
I MEAN, CASSIUS CLAY
HAS HIS OWN STYLE.

39:21.945 --> 39:23.671
THERE'S NO OTHER
FIGHTER LIKE HIM.

39:23.706 --> 39:25.777
NOW SEE, THAT ALMOST DID IT.
SEE? HE'S OUT. HE'S OUT.

39:25.811 --> 39:27.710
OH, GOD, OH, GOD.

39:27.744 --> 39:30.885
LOOK AT IT. TAKE HIM OUT.

39:30.920 --> 39:32.680
THIS IS THE STYLE THAT
CAN WIN THE HEAVYWEIGHT

39:32.715 --> 39:34.751
CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE WORLD.

39:34.786 --> 39:37.029
IN HIS FIRST TWO
MONTHS IN MIAMI,

39:37.064 --> 39:39.584
CLAY FOUGHT 4 TIMES.

39:39.618 --> 39:43.104
ON DECEMBER 27 IN HIS
SECOND PROFESSIONAL FIGHT,

39:43.139 --> 39:46.211
HE DEFEATED HERB SILER
BY TECHNICAL KNOCKOUT

39:46.245 --> 39:48.455
IN 4 ROUNDS.

39:48.489 --> 39:53.321
IN JANUARY 1961, CLAY CELEBRATED
HIS 19th BIRTHDAY

39:53.356 --> 39:57.153
BY DISPATCHING
TONY ESPERTI IN THE THIRD.

39:57.187 --> 40:00.536
3 WEEKS LATER, CLAY
NEEDED JUST ONE ROUND

40:00.570 --> 40:04.056
TO KNOCK OUT JIM ROBINSON.

40:04.091 --> 40:07.784
IN FEBRUARY, CLAY SPARRED
WITH FORMER HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION

40:07.819 --> 40:10.787
INGEMAR JOHANSSON,
WHO WAS IN MIAMI TO PROMOTE

40:10.822 --> 40:14.722
HIS UPCOMING TITLE FIGHT
WITH FLOYD PATTERSON.

40:14.757 --> 40:16.828
CLAY SKIPPED AROUND
JOHANSSON WHILE PEPPERING

40:16.862 --> 40:19.486
THE SWEDE WITH SHARP JABS.

40:19.520 --> 40:23.144
JOHANSSON FAILED TO LAND
A SINGLE PUNCH,

40:23.179 --> 40:25.457
AND HIS MANAGER CUT
THE SESSION SHORT

40:25.492 --> 40:28.598
AFTER JUST TWO ROUNDS.

40:28.633 --> 40:30.566
"I'M THE ONE WHO SHOULD
BE FIGHTING PATTERSON,

40:30.600 --> 40:33.361
NOT YOU, SUCKER," CLAY TAUNTED.

40:36.468 --> 40:40.127
ON APRIL 19
IN FRONT OF MORE THAN 5,000 FANS

40:40.161 --> 40:43.095
AT LOUISVILLE'S FREEDOM HALL,
CLAY RECOVERED

40:43.130 --> 40:45.995
FROM A VICIOUS
FIRST-ROUND PUNCH TO HIS JAW

40:46.029 --> 40:48.584
TO BREAK LAMAR CLARK'S
NOSE AND KNOCK HIM OUT

40:48.618 --> 40:51.621
IN THE SECOND ROUND
JUST AS HE'D PREDICTED

40:51.656 --> 40:55.107
HE WOULD BEFORE THE FIGHT.

40:55.142 --> 40:57.213
"HE HAS THE FASTEST HANDS
OF ANY HEAVYWEIGHT

40:57.247 --> 41:00.319
I'VE SEEN ANY PLACE,"
CLARK'S MANAGER MARVELED,

41:00.354 --> 41:02.321
PREDICTING THAT CLAY WAS
"NOT MANY FIGHTS

41:02.356 --> 41:04.496
FROM A CHAMPIONSHIP."

41:10.364 --> 41:12.366
IN JUNE,
CLAY RELUCTANTLY FLEW

41:12.400 --> 41:14.989
TO LAS VEGAS FOR HIS NEXT MATCH.

41:15.024 --> 41:17.716
"I'M NOT AFRAID OF THE FIGHT,"
HE TOLD A REPORTER,

41:17.751 --> 41:20.236
"I'M AFRAID OF THE FLIGHT."

41:20.270 --> 41:23.308
HIS OPPONENT WAS DUKE SABEDONG,

41:23.342 --> 41:28.486
A TOWERING HAWAIIAN NOTORIOUS
FOR HIS DIRTY TACTICS.

41:28.520 --> 41:32.628
CLAY WON A UNANIMOUS DECISION.

41:32.662 --> 41:36.010
BEFORE THE FIGHT, CLAY HAD
APPEARED ON A LOCAL RADIO

41:36.045 --> 41:38.254
SHOW WITH GEORGE WAGNER,

41:38.288 --> 41:39.911
A WELL-KNOWN
PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER

41:39.945 --> 41:43.673
WHO CALLED HIMSELF
GORGEOUS GEORGE.

41:43.708 --> 41:46.193
HE WOULD COME IN
WITH A JEWELED CAPE,

41:46.227 --> 41:49.748
AND HE WOULD HAVE ONE PERSON
PUTTING THE POMADE IN HIS HAIR,

41:49.783 --> 41:51.819
AND PEOPLE WOULD BOO
AND BOO AND BOO,

41:51.854 --> 41:54.546
AND SOME PEOPLE WOULD CHEER
AND CHEER AND CHEER.

41:54.581 --> 41:57.342
AND CLAY SEES THIS,
AND HE THINKS, "OH, MY GOD.

41:57.376 --> 42:00.276
LOOK AT THE ATTENTION HE GETS."

42:00.310 --> 42:02.554
I SAW HIM TALKING ONCE
ABOUT "HOW PRETTY I AM.

42:02.589 --> 42:04.176
I CANNOT BE BEAT."

42:04.211 --> 42:06.040
HE SAID, "LOOK AT MY
BEAUTIFUL SILVER HAIR.

42:06.075 --> 42:07.732
"NO MAN IN THE WORLD
CAN BEAT ME.

42:07.766 --> 42:10.355
"I'M THE GREATEST WRASSLER
THAT EVER LIVED.

42:10.389 --> 42:11.563
"WHEN I GO INTO THAT
RING I'M GONNA

42:11.598 --> 42:12.840
"ANNIHILATE THE BUM.

42:12.875 --> 42:14.428
I'M BEAUTIFUL."

42:14.462 --> 42:16.257
AND THAT NIGHT WHEN
GORGEOUS GEORGE WENT

42:16.292 --> 42:18.225
TO THE WRASSLING RING,
ALL THE LADIES WERE BOOING,

42:18.259 --> 42:20.261
AND THE PEOPLE WERE SO MAD,
AND THE PLACE WAS FULL.

42:20.296 --> 42:23.299
EVERYBODY PAID
A HIGH PRICE TO COME IN,

42:23.333 --> 42:26.958
AND AT THAT MOMENT I SAID,
"THIS IS A GOOD IDEA."

42:26.992 --> 42:29.547
CLAY--HE'S A SPONGE.

42:29.581 --> 42:34.137
HIS GENIUS IS TO KNOW HOW
TO DEPLOY IT TO HIS ENDS.

42:34.172 --> 42:35.967
BACK IN MIAMI,
HE APPEARED

42:36.001 --> 42:39.039
ON LOCAL TELEVISION AND RADIO,
GRANTING INTERVIEWS

42:39.073 --> 42:42.974
TO ANY WRITER WHO ASKED, TELLING
ONE, "I'M THE BEST FRIEND

42:43.008 --> 42:45.114
A REPORTER EVER HAD."

42:45.148 --> 42:48.462
AND HE WAS BEGINNING
TO ATTRACT NATIONAL ATTENTION.

42:56.539 --> 42:59.784
HE WAS 19 YEARS OLD
IN MIAMI BEACH WHEN HE HEARD

42:59.818 --> 43:02.303
THAT FLIP SCHULKE,
A PHOTOGRAPHER

43:02.338 --> 43:06.273
FOR "LIFE" MAGAZINE, WANTED TO
SHOOT PICTURES OF HIM TRAINING.

43:06.307 --> 43:08.827
SO HE INVITED HIM
TO COME WATCH HIM.

43:08.862 --> 43:11.899
HE TOOK THE ORDINARY PICTURES
LIKE RUNNING ON THE BEACH,

43:11.934 --> 43:14.281
ALL THAT STUFF.

43:14.315 --> 43:17.629
CLAY SAID, "DO YOU WANT TO
SEE ME TRAIN UNDERWATER?"

43:27.121 --> 43:30.331
LATER, SCHULKE REALIZED
WHEN THEY'RE DONE THAT

43:30.366 --> 43:32.264
HE'D BEEN HAD.

43:32.299 --> 43:34.439
CASSIUS CLAY HAD
NEVER TRAINED UNDERWATER.

43:34.473 --> 43:36.683
NOBODY TRAINS UNDERWATER,

43:36.717 --> 43:38.650
BUT CLAY UNDERSTOOD
THE PROMOTION BUSINESS

43:38.685 --> 43:40.963
TO KNOW THAT
IF YOU'RE IN "LIFE" MAGAZINE,

43:40.997 --> 43:43.034
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO SEE IT.

43:43.068 --> 43:45.105
SO HE INVENTED THIS ON
THE SPOT,

43:45.139 --> 43:47.694
AND SCHULKE WAS AMAZED,
THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A SIGN

43:47.728 --> 43:49.765
OF JUST PURE GENIUS,

43:49.799 --> 43:52.353
AND IT WAS.

43:52.388 --> 43:55.184
BEFORE FIGHTS, HE
APPLIED 3 COATS OF POLISH

43:55.218 --> 43:58.359
TO HIS WHITE SHOES,
COVERED HIS ARMS AND TORSO

43:58.394 --> 44:02.122
IN A THIN LAYER OF VASELINE
TO EMPHASIZE HIS MUSCLES,

44:02.156 --> 44:04.883
AND WORE A WHITE SATIN
ROBE AND WHITE TRUNKS

44:04.918 --> 44:06.954
INTO THE RING.

44:06.989 --> 44:09.854
"THE WOMEN SAYS,
'LAND, AIN'T HE NICE AND NEAT',"

44:09.888 --> 44:11.510
EXPLAINED CLAY.

44:11.545 --> 44:14.306
"IF THE WOMEN COME,
THE MEN GOT TO FOLLOW.

44:14.341 --> 44:16.550
AIN'T THAT SO?"

44:16.584 --> 44:19.691
NOT EVERYONE
APPRECIATED HIS COCKINESS.

44:19.726 --> 44:20.968
LET ME SEE
YOU CLOSE YOUR MOUTH

44:21.003 --> 44:22.383
AND JUST KEEP
IT CLOSED.

44:22.418 --> 44:24.040
WELL, YOU KNOW
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

44:24.075 --> 44:25.179
NO, NO,
NOW KEEP IT CLOSED.

44:25.214 --> 44:26.318
YOU KNOW
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

44:26.353 --> 44:27.492
I'M THE GREATEST.

44:27.526 --> 44:29.011
I'M KNOCKING OUT
ALL BUMS,

44:29.045 --> 44:31.876
AND IF YOU GET TOO SMART,
I'LL KNOCK YOU OUT.

44:31.910 --> 44:34.257
IN OCTOBER,
CLAY PREDICTED THE ROUND

44:34.292 --> 44:36.708
IN WHICH HE WOULD DEFEAT
HIS NEXT OPPONENT,

44:36.743 --> 44:39.711
THE ARGENTINIAN ALEX MITEFF.

44:39.746 --> 44:44.060
"MITEFF," HE SAID,
"MUST FALL IN 6."

44:44.095 --> 44:45.337
CLAY HAS REALLY

44:45.372 --> 44:46.718
OPENED FAST.

44:49.376 --> 44:52.413
WHAT MADE CASSIUS
SPECIAL WAS HIS MASTERY

44:52.448 --> 44:55.037
OF THE CRAFT
AT, LIKE, THAT YOUNG AGE.

44:55.071 --> 44:57.246
THIS GUY WAS ABLE TO HAVE
HIS OPPONENT, LIKE,

44:57.280 --> 45:00.767
5, 6 INCHES IN FRONT
OF HIM, THROW, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

45:00.801 --> 45:03.528
A BUNCH OF SHOTS,
CLEAN SHOTS, EFFECTIVE SHOTS,

45:03.562 --> 45:07.566
AND PIROUETTE AROUND THE GUY.

45:07.601 --> 45:11.225
NO ONE IS ABLE TO DO
THAT AS FLUIDLY,

45:11.260 --> 45:15.298
AS SEAMLESSLY AS HIM.

45:15.333 --> 45:17.438
HOW HE DID IT?
I HAVE NO IDEA.

45:17.473 --> 45:22.029
AT 188 POUNDS,
CLAY IS LIGHTNING FAST.

45:22.064 --> 45:25.101
HIS SPEED,
BOTH HIS HAND SPEED

45:25.136 --> 45:29.278
AND HIS FOOT SPEED WAS
JUST INCREDIBLE.

45:32.281 --> 45:34.490
IF YOU THROW A PUNCH
TOO FAR OUT,

45:34.524 --> 45:37.148
WHICH MOST NOVICE FIGHTERS DO,

45:37.182 --> 45:38.736
YOU'RE TOO FAR AWAY
FROM YOUR OPPONENT,

45:38.770 --> 45:41.462
YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO HIT YOUR OPPONENT,

45:41.497 --> 45:44.224
OR IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE,
YOU DON'T HAVE THE LEVERAGE

45:44.258 --> 45:45.777
ON YOUR OPPONENT,

45:45.812 --> 45:47.986
AND IF YOU'RE TOO CLOSE,
YOU'RE EASIER TO TIE UP.

45:48.021 --> 45:50.161
SO IT TAKES A GREAT TALENT.

45:50.195 --> 45:53.129
YOU HAVE TO BE
AT THE EXACT DISTANCE

45:53.164 --> 45:55.407
ALMOST TO THE INCH
AWAY TO LAND

45:55.442 --> 45:58.169
THE MOST EFFECTIVE PUNCH.

45:58.203 --> 46:00.343
MITEFF PAID FOR THAT.

46:00.378 --> 46:02.345
AND CASSIUS
COULD DO THIS.

46:02.380 --> 46:03.968
HE DID IT INNATELY.

46:04.002 --> 46:06.936
MITEFF'S LEFT EYE
CLOSING RAPIDLY,

46:06.971 --> 46:09.974
A TRICKLE OF BLOOD BELOW IT.

46:10.008 --> 46:12.528
AND MITEFF DOWN!

46:12.562 --> 46:21.433
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

46:21.468 --> 46:22.918
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

46:22.952 --> 46:25.506
THEY'RE GOING TO STOP IT,
AND THEY SHOULD.

46:25.541 --> 46:28.268
CLAY STOPPED MITEFF
IN THE SIXTH ROUND

46:28.302 --> 46:30.132
JUST AS HE SAID HE WOULD.

46:30.166 --> 46:35.793
AND THE WINNER
BY A TKO, CASSIUS CLAY!

46:39.348 --> 46:40.728
WHERE DO YOU
RATE YOURSELF TODAY

46:40.763 --> 46:42.800
IN THE HEAVYWEIGHT
RANKS?

46:42.834 --> 46:44.732
WELL, JIM, MOST PEOPLE
SAY I'M CRAZY

46:44.767 --> 46:46.838
OR PUNCH DRUNK
FOR SAYING
THESE THINGS,

46:46.873 --> 46:51.015
BUT I WOULD RATE
MYSELF ABOUT
NUMBER TWO NOW.

46:51.049 --> 46:52.948
HE CLAIMED TO BE
"EMBARRASSED TO GET

46:52.982 --> 46:55.813
INTO THE RING" WITH THE UNRANKED
WILLIE BESMANOFF,

46:55.847 --> 46:59.023
WHOM HE PROMISED TO KNOCK
OUT IN ROUND 7.

46:59.057 --> 47:01.957
WHEN THE GERMAN BOXER BEGAN
TO WOBBLE IN THE FIFTH,

47:01.991 --> 47:05.823
CLAY SLOWED HIS ATTACK,
TOYING WITH HIM FOR TWO ROUNDS

47:05.857 --> 47:09.757
BEFORE MAKING GOOD
AGAIN ON HIS PREDICTION.

47:09.792 --> 47:13.347
CASSIUS CLAY--
HE UNDERSTOOD VERBAL WARFARE.

47:13.382 --> 47:16.488
SO NOT ONLY AM I GOING TO
BEAT YOU PHYSICALLY,

47:16.523 --> 47:19.871
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW
BAD I'M GOING TO BEAT YOU,

47:19.906 --> 47:23.979
AND IF YOU'RE BETTER THAN ME,
YOU'LL SHUT ME UP.

47:24.013 --> 47:25.773
YOU'LL MAKE ME STOP TALKING.

47:25.808 --> 47:27.741
IF NOT, YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME TALK.

47:27.775 --> 47:30.778
I'M GOING TO ADD
TO THE HUMILIATION.

47:30.813 --> 47:33.747
IT'S AN ADDED LAYER,
AND IF YOU CAN'T GET

47:33.781 --> 47:36.094
BEYOND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL
WARFARE,

47:36.129 --> 47:37.993
IT'S UNLIKELY THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO WIN

47:38.027 --> 47:40.512
THE PHYSICAL WARFARE.

47:40.547 --> 47:42.376
CLAY'S PROFESSIONAL RECORD

47:42.411 --> 47:45.172
WAS NOW 10-0,
HIS FUTURE BRIGHT,

47:45.207 --> 47:47.554
AND HIS CONFIDENCE SOARING.

47:47.588 --> 47:51.075
"I GOT THE HEIGHT, THE REACH,
THE WEIGHT," HE DECLARED.

47:51.109 --> 47:54.078
"TO BEAT ME, YOU GOT TO BE
GREATER THAN GREAT."

47:57.805 --> 48:01.361
IN LATE 1961,
CASSIUS CLAY WAS DIVIDING

48:01.395 --> 48:04.122
HIS TIME BETWEEN LOUISVILLE
AND MIAMI,

48:04.157 --> 48:06.297
WHERE HE CONTINUED
TO PURSUE BOXING

48:06.331 --> 48:08.747
WITH A SINGLE-MINDED ZEAL.

48:08.782 --> 48:12.130
STILL JUST 19
BUT NOW MAINLY ON HIS OWN,

48:12.165 --> 48:15.030
CLAY HAD BECOME A FAMILIAR FACE
IN OVERTOWN, RUNNING A TAB

48:15.064 --> 48:17.929
AT THE FAMOUS CHEF RESTAURANT

48:17.964 --> 48:19.966
AND COMPOSING RHYMES
FOR THE OTHER CLIENTS

48:20.000 --> 48:23.901
AT SONNY ARMBRIMSTER'S
BARBER SHOP.

48:23.935 --> 48:26.593
WHEN LOCAL HUSTLERS INVITED
HIM TO THE SIR JOHN

48:26.627 --> 48:29.941
OR HARLEM SQUARE, WHERE
COUNT BASIE, ELLA FITZGERALD,

48:29.976 --> 48:32.944
AND B.B. KING PERFORMED,
CLAY JOINED THEM

48:32.979 --> 48:36.465
FOR THE MUSIC BUT DRANK
ONLY ORANGE JUICE

48:36.499 --> 48:40.331
AND NEVER STAYED LONG.

48:40.365 --> 48:43.299
WHEN HE VENTURED
BEYOND OVERTOWN TO WHITE MIAMI,

48:43.334 --> 48:45.681
WHERE AFRICAN-AMERICANS
WERE REGULARLY HARASSED

48:45.715 --> 48:49.788
BY THE LOCAL POLICE,
CLAY KEPT HIS COOL.

48:49.823 --> 48:53.309
AT A DEPARTMENT STORE,
A WHITE PHOTOGRAPHER LOOKED ON

48:53.344 --> 48:57.279
AS CLAY WAS SCOLDED
BY A CLERK FOR HANDLING A SHIRT.

48:57.313 --> 49:00.765
THE PHOTOGRAPHER WAS INDIGNANT,
BUT CLAY SAID,

49:00.799 --> 49:02.870
"I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
A BIG MESS HERE.

49:02.905 --> 49:04.631
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL."

49:11.362 --> 49:13.605
NOW IT IS
TRUE THAT MEN HAVE ALWAYS

49:13.640 --> 49:16.470
CRIED OUT FOR FREEDOM,

49:16.505 --> 49:21.855
BUT IN THE PAST,
THESE CRIES FOR FREEDOM WERE

49:21.889 --> 49:26.894
IN MANY INSTANCES
SOLO VOICES CRYING FOR FREEDOM,

49:26.929 --> 49:29.967
BUT THE DIFFERENCE TODAY
IS THAT THIS SOLO VOICE

49:30.001 --> 49:32.970
HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED
INTO A MIGHTY CHORUS,

49:33.004 --> 49:36.214
SINGING WITH AMAZING HARMONY,

49:36.249 --> 49:38.665
"WE WANT TO BE FREE."

49:38.699 --> 49:40.460
IT IS TRUE THAT WE...

49:40.494 --> 49:42.117
CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS
HAD BEEN CHALLENGING

49:42.151 --> 49:45.396
SEGREGATION WITH NON-VIOLENT
ACTION ON BUSES

49:45.430 --> 49:49.848
AND AT LUNCH COUNTERS
ACROSS THE SOUTH,

49:49.883 --> 49:52.644
BUT WHEN ASKED ABOUT
RACIAL INJUSTICE,

49:52.679 --> 49:55.923
CLAY SAID HE WISHED TO PROTECT
THE WHITE LOUISVILLE SYNDICATE

49:55.958 --> 49:58.029
THAT MANAGED HIS CAREER.

49:58.064 --> 50:00.480
"I DON'T JOIN ANY GROUPS
OR NOTHING BECAUSE IT MIGHT

50:00.514 --> 50:04.208
EMBARRASS MY SPONSORS,"
HE TOLD ONE REPORTER.

50:04.242 --> 50:07.038
HE KNEW SPEAKING OUT
ON MATTERS OF RACE WOULD

50:07.073 --> 50:10.524
ONLY HARM HIS CHANCES OF
ONE DAY GETTING A TITLE FIGHT.

50:10.559 --> 50:13.044
AND THAT IS ANOTHER THING
THAT YOU ARE SAYING

50:13.079 --> 50:15.184
TO LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY,
AND THAT YOU ARE SAYING

50:15.219 --> 50:19.740
TO THE NATION IN THIS MOVEMENT,
THAT THE NEGRO IS ETERNALLY

50:19.775 --> 50:22.433
THROUGH WITH SEGREGATION.

50:24.435 --> 50:28.335
STILL, THE MEMORY
OF EMMETT TILL HAUNTED HIM,

50:28.370 --> 50:32.063
AND HIS FATHER'S EVER-PRESENT
ANGER AT RACIAL OPPRESSION

50:32.098 --> 50:35.791
CONTINUED TO STIR
HIS OWN CONSCIENCE.

50:35.825 --> 50:39.588
WHY ARE WE
CALLED NEGRO?

50:39.622 --> 50:44.593
WHY ARE WE DEAF,
DUMB, AND BLIND?

50:44.627 --> 50:47.699
YEARS EARLIER,
CLAY HAD PURCHASED A RECORD

50:47.734 --> 50:52.532
CALLED "A WHITE MAN'S
HEAVEN IS A BLACK MAN'S HELL,"

50:52.566 --> 50:55.259
WRITTEN AND PERFORMED
BY LOUIS X,

50:55.293 --> 50:57.192
A MINISTER
FOR THE NATION OF ISLAM,

50:57.226 --> 51:00.574
WHICH CLAY LISTENED TO
OVER AND OVER.

51:00.609 --> 51:03.646
A WHITE MAN'S HEAVEN
IS A BLACK MAN'S HELL.

51:03.681 --> 51:06.753
ONE DAY IN MIAMI,
CLAY SPOTTED A BLACK MAN

51:06.787 --> 51:09.652
IN A SUIT SELLING COPIES
OF THE NEWSPAPER

51:09.687 --> 51:11.723
"MUHAMMAD SPEAKS."

51:11.758 --> 51:14.933
I WAS SELLING THE PAPERS
ONE DAY ON THE STREETS,

51:14.968 --> 51:17.108
AND HE SAW ME.

51:17.143 --> 51:19.662
HE SAID, "HEY, BROTHER!

51:19.697 --> 51:22.148
"WHY ARE WE CALLED NEGROES?

51:22.182 --> 51:24.840
"WHY ARE WE BLIND,
DEAF, AND DUMB?

51:24.874 --> 51:26.324
"WHY EVERYBODY
MAKING PROGRESS,

51:26.359 --> 51:29.224
AND WE LAGGING SO FAR BEHIND?"

51:29.258 --> 51:30.570
I HOLLERED--
I LOOKED BACK AT HIM,

51:30.604 --> 51:32.019
I SAID "HEY, MAN!

51:32.054 --> 51:33.918
YOU HIP TO THE TEACHINGS,
AIN'T YEAH?"

51:33.952 --> 51:36.576
HE SAID,
"YEAH. I'M CASSIUS CLAY.

51:36.610 --> 51:38.440
"I'M GONNA BE THE NEXT
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION

51:38.474 --> 51:40.131
OF THE WORLD."

51:40.166 --> 51:42.271
A ONE-TIME POOL
SHARK FROM ATLANTA,

51:42.306 --> 51:45.136
ABDUL RAHMAN--
KNOWN AS CAPTAIN SAM--

51:45.171 --> 51:47.932
HAD ABANDONED A LIFE OF HUSTLING
WHEN HE HEARD THE TEACHINGS

51:47.966 --> 51:52.971
OF THE NATION OF ISLAM'S LEADER
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD.

51:53.006 --> 51:55.422
THE SO-CALLED AMERICAN NEGRO

51:55.457 --> 52:04.431
HAS TO BE COMPLETELY REEDUCATED
THAT HE NOW CAN MOVE OUT

52:04.466 --> 52:08.470
IN THE WORLD AND FEEL THAT
HE IS THE EQUAL

52:08.504 --> 52:15.062
OF OTHER CIVILIZED BEINGS
AND DOES NOT FEEL ASHAMED

52:15.097 --> 52:17.341
TO BE CALLED A BLACK MAN.

52:21.828 --> 52:24.071
CAPTAIN SAM
ENCOURAGED CLAY TO ATTEND

52:24.106 --> 52:26.833
MEETINGS AT TEMPLE NO. 29,

52:26.867 --> 52:31.631
A VACANT STOREFRONT THAT HAD
BEEN TURNED INTO A MOSQUE.

52:31.665 --> 52:34.703
"THE FIRST TIME I FELT
TRULY SPIRITUAL IN MY LIFE

52:34.737 --> 52:37.464
WAS WHEN I WALKED INTO
THE MUSLIM TEMPLE IN MIAMI,"

52:37.499 --> 52:39.915
CLAY LATER RECALLED.

52:39.949 --> 52:42.504
"A MAN NAMED BROTHER JOHN
WAS SPEAKING,

52:42.538 --> 52:46.473
AND I COULD REACH OUT AND TOUCH
WHAT HE WAS SAYING."

52:46.508 --> 52:49.649
GOD WAS BLACK,
PREACHED THE MINISTER.

52:49.683 --> 52:51.685
THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF
RECONCILIATION

52:51.720 --> 52:54.067
WITH WHITE PEOPLE,
WHO HAD DELIBERATELY STOLEN

52:54.101 --> 52:56.656
THE BLACK MAN'S IDENTITY.

52:56.690 --> 53:00.591
ONLY BY EMBRACING ALLAH
WOULD BLACK PEOPLE OVERCOME

53:00.625 --> 53:02.558
WHITE CRUELTY.

53:02.593 --> 53:05.251
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD PRESENTED
ISLAM AS THIS ALTERNATIVE

53:05.285 --> 53:08.081
TO CHRISTIANITY,
"THE BLACK MAN'S RELIGION,"

53:08.115 --> 53:10.497
AND THAT WAS A SELLING POINT
THAT ELIJAH MUHAMMAD USED,

53:10.532 --> 53:13.535
AND IT WAS PRETTY EFFECTIVE.

53:13.569 --> 53:16.331
HE'S STEPPING
INTO AN ALTERNATE REALITY,

53:16.365 --> 53:19.886
WHERE UP IS DOWN AND DOWN IS UP
AND BLACK IS SACRED

53:19.920 --> 53:21.888
AND BLACK IS VALUABLE.

53:21.922 --> 53:24.856
YOU KNOW, YOUR MIND IS BLOWN.

53:24.891 --> 53:26.927
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
DEFINITELY HAS ENORMOUS

53:26.962 --> 53:29.067
TRANSFORMATIVE POWER.

53:29.102 --> 53:30.724
ESPECIALLY
FOR THE LOWER-INCOME

53:30.759 --> 53:33.037
AND LESSER-EDUCATED
AFRICAN-AMERICANS

53:33.071 --> 53:37.628
WHO HE WAS TARGETING
AT THAT TIME.

53:37.662 --> 53:41.356
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
WAS BORN ELIJAH POOLE,

53:41.390 --> 53:46.430
THE SON OF A BAPTIST PREACHER,
IN RURAL GEORGIA IN 1897.

53:46.464 --> 53:49.467
WHEN POOLE WAS 14,
A WHITE MOB LYNCHED

53:49.502 --> 53:52.159
HIS FRIEND ALBERT HAMILTON,
WHO WAS ACCUSED

53:52.194 --> 53:54.886
OF ASSAULTING A WHITE WOMAN.

53:54.921 --> 53:57.613
THE ANGRY CROWD HAD DRAGGED
HAMILTON FROM A JAIL CELL,

53:57.648 --> 54:00.133
HUNG HIM FROM A TREE,
AND SHOT HIM

54:00.167 --> 54:02.653
MORE THAN 300 TIMES.

54:02.687 --> 54:05.587
POOLE RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD,
HE SAID, "FIND A WAY

54:05.621 --> 54:08.693
TO AVENGE HIM AND MY PEOPLE."

54:11.178 --> 54:14.665
IN 1923, POOLE MOVED TO DETROIT,

54:14.699 --> 54:17.840
WHERE HE FELL UNDER THE SWAY OF
A SELF-STYLED MESSIAH

54:17.875 --> 54:20.636
NAMED W.D. FARD.

54:20.671 --> 54:23.846
A CHARISMATIC ORATOR,
FARD HAD INVENTED

54:23.881 --> 54:26.746
AN ELABORATE HISTORY
AND THEOLOGY FOR BLACK PEOPLE

54:26.780 --> 54:29.921
ROOTED IN THE BELIEF THAT
THEY WERE THE EARTH'S

54:29.956 --> 54:33.960
ORIGINAL INHABITANTS, RULING
FOR TRILLIONS OF YEARS

54:33.994 --> 54:37.998
UNDER THE BANNER OF ISLAM
UNTIL THEY WERE UNDERMINED

54:38.033 --> 54:41.312
BY A RACE OF "WHITE DEVILS,"
WHO WOULD ONE DAY FACE

54:41.347 --> 54:45.696
A BRUTAL END AT THE HAND
OF ALLAH.

54:45.730 --> 54:48.699
HE PREACHED BLACK SEPARATISM,
SELF-DETERMINATION,

54:48.733 --> 54:51.874
AND CLEAN LIVING
AND SOMETIMES ASSIGNED

54:51.909 --> 54:54.463
CONVERTS NEW SURNAMES
TO REPLACE

54:54.498 --> 54:57.432
THEIR "SLAVE NAMES."

54:57.466 --> 55:02.816
FARD CALLED HIS GROUP
THE LOST-FOUND NATION OF ISLAM.

55:02.851 --> 55:08.339
POOLE, HIS LATEST CONVERT,
BECAME ELIJAH MUHAMMAD.

55:08.374 --> 55:10.686
THERE WAS A TRADITION
OF THOSE KINDS OF GROUPS.

55:10.721 --> 55:13.171
THERE WAS
THE MOORISH SCIENCE TEMPLE

55:13.206 --> 55:14.794
OF NOBLE DREW ALI.

55:14.828 --> 55:17.037
THERE WAS THE BLACK
HEBREW ORGANIZATION

55:17.072 --> 55:18.832
OF THIS GUY
BY THE NAME BLACK ZARAB.

55:18.867 --> 55:20.869
THERE WAS MARCUS GARVEY'S

55:20.903 --> 55:23.009
UNITED NEGRO
IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION,

55:23.043 --> 55:26.150
AND THE NATION OF ISLAM
WAS JUST ONE OF THEM.

55:26.184 --> 55:30.050
THEY CALL BLACK CHRISTIANITY
THE WHITE MAN'S RELIGION,

55:30.085 --> 55:34.020
AND CHRISTIANITY WAS DEEPLY
ROOTED IN BLACK AMERICA,

55:34.054 --> 55:36.471
AND ANYONE WHO LOOKED
AT THEMSELVES AS AN ENEMY

55:36.505 --> 55:38.714
TO THAT TRADITION WAS SEEN
AS SOMEONE

55:38.749 --> 55:41.268
WHO WAS ALMOST DEMONIC,

55:41.303 --> 55:44.858
AND IT WAS THAT KIND
OF FEAR ABOUT THEM.

55:44.893 --> 55:48.552
WHEN FARD
MYSTERIOUSLY VANISHED IN 1934,

55:48.586 --> 55:50.726
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD TOOK CONTROL,

55:50.761 --> 55:53.211
CALLED HIMSELF
THE "MESSENGER OF ALLAH,"

55:53.246 --> 55:56.283
AND RELOCATED TO CHICAGO.

55:56.318 --> 55:59.114
HE WENT TO PRISON RATHER
THAN REGISTER FOR THE DRAFT

55:59.148 --> 56:02.220
DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR,
CONTINUED TO PREACH

56:02.255 --> 56:04.188
SEPARATION OF THE RACES,

56:04.222 --> 56:06.915
AND SPOKE OF THE "MOTHER PLANE,"

56:06.949 --> 56:09.296
A WHEEL-SHAPED SPACECRAFT
HE CLAIMED

56:09.331 --> 56:11.402
WAS HOVERING MILES
ABOVE THE EARTH,

56:11.437 --> 56:14.405
WAITING TO
ANNIHILATE THE "WHITE DEVILS"

56:14.440 --> 56:17.374
ON JUDGMENT DAY.

56:17.408 --> 56:19.721
THOUGH ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
BORROWED ABUNDANTLY

56:19.755 --> 56:23.103
FROM MUSLIM TEACHINGS,
HIS MESSAGE OF SEPARATISM

56:23.138 --> 56:25.968
AND CLAIM TO BE A PROPHET
DIVERGED SHARPLY

56:26.003 --> 56:28.557
FROM TRADITIONAL ISLAM,
A RELIGION FOUNDED

56:28.592 --> 56:32.216
IN THE EIGHTH CENTURY THAT,
BY 1950,

56:32.250 --> 56:35.840
HAD MORE THAN 400 MILLION
FOLLOWERS AROUND THE WORLD.

56:37.773 --> 56:40.397
THE NATION OF ISLAM WAS
AN AMERICAN HYBRID.

56:40.431 --> 56:45.988
IT USED CERTAIN TENETS OF ISLAM,
BUT OTHER TENETS

56:46.023 --> 56:50.441
WERE MADE UP
BY THEM OR IMPROVISED.

56:50.476 --> 56:52.926
THEY TRIED TO AMERICANIZE IT
TO THE POINT

56:52.961 --> 56:55.722
WHERE IT WAS NOT AUTHENTIC.

56:55.757 --> 57:00.071
ELIJAH WAS NOT
THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD.

57:00.106 --> 57:03.178
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD--
HIS MODEL WAS DO FOR SELF.

57:03.212 --> 57:05.594
BLACK PEOPLE NEED TO DO
FOR THEMSELVES,

57:05.629 --> 57:07.182
THEY NEED TO BUILD
FOR THEMSELVES,

57:07.216 --> 57:08.839
THEY NEED TO START THEIR
OWN BUSINESSES.

57:08.873 --> 57:11.186
YOU NEED TO CONTROL
YOUR OWN COMMUNITIES.

57:11.220 --> 57:13.464
LET'S QUIT BEGGING WHITE PEOPLE
FOR JOBS.

57:13.499 --> 57:16.294
LET'S MAKE JOBS FOR OURSELVES.

57:16.329 --> 57:18.573
WE HAD TO BE SELF-INDEPENDENT

57:18.607 --> 57:22.508
INSTEAD OF BEING IN SOME
WELFARE LINE OR EMPLOYMENT,

57:22.542 --> 57:24.130
LOOKING FOR A JOB.

57:24.164 --> 57:25.994
WE WAS TRYING TO MAKE JOBS
FOR OURSELVES,

57:26.028 --> 57:28.099
TRYING TO KEEP
THE MONEY IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD

57:28.134 --> 57:32.172
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
TO ENRICH THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

57:32.207 --> 57:35.348
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
PURCHASED A FARM IN MICHIGAN

57:35.382 --> 57:37.350
AND OPENED A CLOTHING
STORE, BAKERY,

57:37.384 --> 57:42.389
AND RESTAURANT IN CHICAGO
SERVING MOSTLY BLACK CUSTOMERS.

57:42.424 --> 57:43.977
WE HATE OURSELVES.

57:44.012 --> 57:45.600
THAT'S RIGHT.THAT'S RIGHT!

57:45.634 --> 57:47.809
BECAUSE OF THE TEACHINGS

57:47.843 --> 57:50.674
AND THE TRAINING
OF OUR SLAVE MASTERS.

57:50.708 --> 57:52.158
YES, SIR!

57:52.192 --> 57:53.677
YOU NEED TO MOVE AWAY

57:53.711 --> 57:55.472
FROM THESE WHITE PEOPLE.

57:55.506 --> 57:56.852
YOU DON'T WANT TO INTEGRATE
WITH THESE WHITE PEOPLE,

57:56.887 --> 57:58.509
YOU WANT TO MOVE
AWAY FROM THEM.

57:58.544 --> 58:01.478
YOUR SLAVE MASTER
AND ALL HIS CHILDREN

58:01.512 --> 58:05.412
ARE NONE OTHER
THAN THE DEVIL.

58:05.447 --> 58:08.243
HE WAS GENERALLY
REGARDED BY MEMBERS

58:08.277 --> 58:10.417
OF THAT MOVEMENT
AS THE MESSENGER

58:10.452 --> 58:12.005
OF ALLAH OR GOD.

58:12.040 --> 58:14.214
HE WAS HIGHLY REVERED,
AND THEY ANSWER

58:14.249 --> 58:16.251
TO HIS DICTATES.

58:16.285 --> 58:19.047
THIS AN AFFIRMATION
OF BLACK HUMANITY

58:19.081 --> 58:23.327
AND BLACK DIGNITY AS INDIVIDUALS
AND AS A COLLECTIVE.

58:23.361 --> 58:26.226
HERE'S HOPE IN THE FORM
OF A TANGIBLE PROGRAM

58:26.261 --> 58:29.022
THAT YOU CAN FOLLOW THAT
WILL GET YOU THERE.

58:29.057 --> 58:30.748
I SAY,
GET OUT OF THAT

58:30.783 --> 58:32.060
SLAVERY TEACHING.

58:32.094 --> 58:33.855
THAT'S THE WHITE MAN'S
TEACHING

58:33.889 --> 58:35.684
TO KEEP YOU BLIND, DEAF,
AND DUMB

58:35.719 --> 58:39.274
TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF SELF.

58:39.308 --> 58:41.379
THE NATION OF ISLAM HAD
A PRESENCE

58:41.414 --> 58:44.590
IN AMERICAN PRISONS
AND YOU CAN ENCOUNTER A GUY

58:44.624 --> 58:48.421
WHO WAS NOT VERY EDUCATED,
DIDN'T DO VERY WELL IN SCHOOL,

58:48.455 --> 58:50.354
MAYBE EVEN DROPPED OUT,
WENT TO PRISON,

58:50.388 --> 58:52.459
AND JOINED THE NATION OF ISLAM.

58:52.494 --> 58:54.358
COMES OUT OF PRISON,
AND NOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE

58:54.392 --> 58:57.292
A DICTIONARY TO HAVE
A CONVERSATION WITH HIM.

58:57.326 --> 59:01.779
MASTERY OF STANDARD ENGLISH
NOW IS NO LONGER INDEXED

59:01.814 --> 59:05.231
TO ANY KIND OF UNCLE TOMISM,
BUT NOW IS EQUATED

59:05.265 --> 59:09.580
WITH WHAT IT MEANS TO BE
A DIGNIFIED BLACK MAN.

59:09.615 --> 59:12.031
THIS MAN SAVED THOUSANDS
AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

59:12.065 --> 59:16.104
FROM THE GUTTER AND TOOK
MANY OUT OF THE GUTTER.

59:16.138 --> 59:19.452
MANY DRUG ADDICTS
CLEANED UP UNDER HIS TEACHINGS,

59:19.486 --> 59:21.419
SO YOU CAN'T DO NOTHING
BUT MARVEL OVER A MAN

59:21.454 --> 59:23.111
CAN DO THAT.

59:23.145 --> 59:24.906
THE NATION
APPEALED AT FIRST MOSTLY

59:24.940 --> 59:29.462
TO POOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS,
BUT BY THE LATE 1950s,

59:29.496 --> 59:32.879
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S MESSAGE OF
BLACK EMPOWERMENT BEGAN REACHING

59:32.914 --> 59:35.157
SOME MEMBERS OF THE BLACK
MIDDLE CLASS

59:35.192 --> 59:39.714
FRUSTRATED WITH THE SLOW PACE
OF CHANGE.

59:39.748 --> 59:45.478
THE NATION OF ISLAM WAS
SUCH A FRINGE GROUP THAT

59:45.512 --> 59:48.239
VERY FEW CERTAINLY
WHITE AMERICANS

59:48.274 --> 59:50.138
HAD EVER HEARD OF IT.

59:50.172 --> 59:51.657
EVEN THE CLOTHES THEY WEAR...

59:51.691 --> 59:54.625
BUT 1959,
MIKE WALLACE DID

59:54.660 --> 59:56.282
A BIG DOCUMENTARY ON IT

59:56.316 --> 59:58.008
"THE HATE THAT HATE PRODUCED."

59:58.042 --> 1:00:01.321
THESE HOMEGROWN
NEGRO AMERICAN MUSLIMS

1:00:01.356 --> 1:00:04.462
ARE THE MOST POWERFUL
OF THE BLACK SUPREMACIST GROUPS.

1:00:04.497 --> 1:00:07.086
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN
PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS,

1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:10.537
WHERE MUSLIM CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT
TO HATE THE WHITE MAN.

1:00:10.572 --> 1:00:13.817
THIS DOCUMENTARY WAS
DESIGNED TO BE PROVOCATIVE

1:00:13.851 --> 1:00:16.026
AND FRIGHTENING ACTUALLY

1:00:16.060 --> 1:00:18.684
TO YOUR AVERAGE WHITE VIEWER.

1:00:18.718 --> 1:00:20.478
I CHARGE
THE WHITE MAN WITH BEING

1:00:20.513 --> 1:00:22.929
THE GREATEST TROUBLEMAKER
ON EARTH.

1:00:22.964 --> 1:00:24.448
THE WHITE MAN HAS
BEEN PUT ON TRIAL

1:00:24.482 --> 1:00:25.932
FOR HIS SINS
AGAINST THE BLACK MAN.

1:00:25.967 --> 1:00:28.003
HE HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY.

1:00:28.038 --> 1:00:29.764
THE SENTENCE IS DEATH.

1:00:29.798 --> 1:00:33.871
GUILTY AS CHARGED.

1:00:33.906 --> 1:00:37.634
"OH, MY GOD. THIS IS
WHAT THESE ANGRY BLACK PEOPLE

1:00:37.668 --> 1:00:39.843
ARE PLANNING TO DO."

1:00:39.877 --> 1:00:43.985
THIS IS A MOMENT OF REAL PANIC
FOR A LOT OF WHITE PEOPLE

1:00:44.019 --> 1:00:45.952
WHEN THIS DOCUMENTARY AIRS,

1:00:45.987 --> 1:00:50.232
AND I THINK IT WAS--
IT WAS MEANT TO BE THAT.

1:00:50.267 --> 1:00:53.235
IN MIAMI,
CASSIUS CLAY QUIETLY CONTINUED

1:00:53.270 --> 1:00:57.170
TO ATTEND MEETINGS
AT TEMPLE NO. 29.

1:00:57.205 --> 1:01:01.243
HE BECOMES ATTRACTED
TO ITS MESSAGE OF PRIDE,

1:01:01.278 --> 1:01:04.074
OF NOT DEPENDING
ON THE BENEFICENCE AND FAVORS

1:01:04.108 --> 1:01:07.146
OF WHITES AND WHITE POLITICS,

1:01:07.180 --> 1:01:10.908
AND IT'S MARRIED TO A SENSE
OF RELIGION AND A RHETORIC

1:01:10.943 --> 1:01:13.600
OF NO MORE SLAVE NAME,
A NEW NAME,

1:01:13.635 --> 1:01:15.672
AND HE GETS CAUGHT UP,

1:01:15.706 --> 1:01:17.570
AND THE MESSAGE, WHICH WAS
SO IRONIC BECAUSE

1:01:17.604 --> 1:01:21.091
HE'S SURROUNDED
BY WHITE PEOPLE A LOT,

1:01:21.125 --> 1:01:24.888
OF SEPARATISM.

1:01:24.922 --> 1:01:27.062
YOU BASICALLY SEE
YOURSELF AS HAVING REMOVED

1:01:27.097 --> 1:01:28.892
YOURSELF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

1:01:28.926 --> 1:01:30.756
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE INTERACTING
WITH IT,

1:01:30.790 --> 1:01:33.690
YOU HAVE BASICALLY
REMOVED YOURSELF FROM IT.

1:01:33.724 --> 1:01:37.901
THAT'S APPEALING,
BUT IT'S ALSO DANGEROUS.

1:01:37.935 --> 1:01:40.558
THE REASON WHY IT WAS SO
APPEALING IS BECAUSE CULTS

1:01:40.593 --> 1:01:42.422
GIVE YOU THIS VISION
OF UTOPIA,

1:01:42.457 --> 1:01:44.839
THIS VISION OF HAVING
THIS COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE

1:01:44.873 --> 1:01:46.599
THAT YOU WOULD BE AROUND,

1:01:46.633 --> 1:01:48.739
THIS VISION THAT WE WERE
ALL MARCHING FORWARD

1:01:48.774 --> 1:01:51.638
FOR THIS GOAL
OF LIBERATING BLACK PEOPLE,

1:01:51.673 --> 1:01:56.057
AND YOU HAD THIS GOD ALLAH,
AND YOU SAW HOW BLACK WOMEN

1:01:56.091 --> 1:01:58.231
WERE BEING RESPECTED
AND HOW BLACK MEN

1:01:58.266 --> 1:02:00.647
WERE LOOKED UP TO.

1:02:00.682 --> 1:02:03.236
IT SEEMED LIKE A DREAM.

1:02:03.271 --> 1:02:04.962
THAT'S WHAT CULTS DO TO PEOPLE.

1:02:04.997 --> 1:02:08.725
THEY OFFER YOU A KIND OF DREAM.

1:02:08.759 --> 1:02:09.933
I PREDICTED TO WIN
THE CHAMPIONSHIP

1:02:09.967 --> 1:02:11.417
AT THE AGE OF 21.

1:02:11.451 --> 1:02:13.868
I'M OUT TO BREAK
FLOYD PATTERSON'S RECORD,

1:02:13.902 --> 1:02:16.560
AND BY THIS DAY, MY 20th
BIRTHDAY TODAY,

1:02:16.594 --> 1:02:20.150
JANUARY THE 17th, THAT
LEAVES ME EXACTLY ONE YEAR

1:02:20.184 --> 1:02:22.739
TO REACH MY GOAL.

1:02:22.773 --> 1:02:26.777
IN EARLY FEBRUARY
OF 1962, ANGELO DUNDEE GOT

1:02:26.812 --> 1:02:29.987
A PHONE CALL FROM A PROMOTER
AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN,

1:02:30.022 --> 1:02:33.301
WHO OFFERED CLAY
A FIGHT AGAINST SONNY BANKS,

1:02:33.335 --> 1:02:36.891
A HARD-PUNCHING JOURNEYMAN
FROM DETROIT.

1:02:36.925 --> 1:02:38.271
IT WOULD BE HIS FIRST FIGHT

1:02:38.306 --> 1:02:42.068
AT BOXING'S MOST
CELEBRATED VENUE.

1:02:42.103 --> 1:02:44.588
CLAY BOASTED
TO SPORTSWRITERS THAT BANKS

1:02:44.622 --> 1:02:48.903
WOULD FALL IN THE FOURTH ROUND.

1:02:48.937 --> 1:02:51.353
FROM LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY,

1:02:51.388 --> 1:02:58.809
WEARING WHITE TRUNKS,
WEIGHING 194.5 POUNDS,

1:02:58.844 --> 1:03:02.606
THE FORMER OLYMPIC CHAMPION
AND UNDEFEATED

1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:08.129
AS A PROFESSIONAL
CASSIUS CLAY, CLAY.

1:03:08.163 --> 1:03:11.615
HIS OPPONENT,
FROM DETROIT, MICHIGAN,

1:03:11.649 --> 1:03:15.343
SONNY BANKS, BANKS.

1:03:15.377 --> 1:03:17.000
ROUND ONE!

1:03:17.034 --> 1:03:18.691
10 ROUNDS SCHEDULED.

1:03:18.725 --> 1:03:20.279
IF BANKS DOES ANYTHING,

1:03:20.313 --> 1:03:21.556
IT'S FIGURED TO BE EARLY.

1:03:21.590 --> 1:03:22.729
HE'S A POWER PUNCHER

1:03:22.764 --> 1:03:24.524
EARLY IN A FIGHT.

1:03:24.559 --> 1:03:26.112
CLAY IS THE MOST LOQUACIOUS

1:03:26.147 --> 1:03:27.804
HEAVYWEIGHT SINCE JACK SHARKEY.

1:03:34.396 --> 1:03:37.330
THERE GOES CLAY ON THE FLOOR!

1:03:37.365 --> 1:03:40.057
WHEN CLAY WAS KNOCKED
DOWN IN THE FIRST, DUNDEE WAS

1:03:40.092 --> 1:03:42.370
AFRAID HIS BOXER'S CAREER
WAS OVER

1:03:42.404 --> 1:03:44.890
BEFORE IT HAD REALLY STARTED.

1:03:44.924 --> 1:03:48.307
"CASSIUS WENT DOWN EYES
CLOSED," DUNDEE REMEMBERED,

1:03:48.341 --> 1:03:49.998
"BUT WHEN HIS BUTT
HIT THE FLOOR,

1:03:50.033 --> 1:03:52.829
THEY OPENED AND LIT UP."

1:03:52.863 --> 1:03:54.692
YOU HAVE TO GET KNOCKED
DOWN AT SOME POINT.

1:03:54.727 --> 1:03:56.246
IF THE FIGHTER WHO GOT
KNOCKS DOWN PANICS,

1:03:56.280 --> 1:03:57.385
GUESS WHAT.

1:03:57.419 --> 1:03:59.214
I GOTCHA.

1:03:59.249 --> 1:04:01.354
BECAUSE, IF I KNOCK YOU DOWN,
THAT MEANS I CAN

1:04:01.389 --> 1:04:04.426
KNOCK YOU OUT.

1:04:04.461 --> 1:04:06.359
CASSIUS NEVER PANICKED.

1:04:06.394 --> 1:04:08.189
HE KNEW HOW TO RESPOND TO IT.

1:04:08.223 --> 1:04:11.744
HE KNEW HOW TO STAY POISED
AND STAY IN CONTROL.

1:04:11.778 --> 1:04:15.230
FIRST TIME THAT
CASSIUS CLAY WAS EVER DOWN.

1:04:15.265 --> 1:04:18.026
IN THE SECOND ROUND,
HE TOOK COMMAND,

1:04:18.061 --> 1:04:21.236
BEWILDERING BANKS
WITH BLOW AFTER BLOW.

1:04:21.271 --> 1:04:23.273
HE STAYED LOYAL
TO HIS JAB

1:04:23.307 --> 1:04:25.792
AND THEN WENT TO WORK ON HIM.

1:04:25.827 --> 1:04:27.622
ROUND 4.

1:04:30.556 --> 1:04:35.457
NOW CLAY SEEMS TO BE
COMING ON A LITTLE BIT.

1:04:35.492 --> 1:04:36.907
HOLD IT, HOLD IT,
HOLD IT.

1:04:36.942 --> 1:04:38.391
IN THE FOURTH ROUND,

1:04:38.426 --> 1:04:40.290
THE REFEREE HAD SEEN ENOUGH

1:04:40.324 --> 1:04:43.293
AND CALLED THE MATCH
IN FAVOR OF CLAY...

1:04:43.327 --> 1:04:46.537
WINNER
BY TKO CASSIUS CLAY.

1:04:46.572 --> 1:04:49.782
JUST AS HE HAD PREDICTED.

1:04:49.816 --> 1:04:52.578
"WATCHING HIM GET UP
OFF THE FLOOR AGAINST BANKS

1:04:52.612 --> 1:04:55.926
AND THEN RECOVER
TO WIN," DUNDEE REMEMBERED,

1:04:55.961 --> 1:04:58.584
"THAT'S THE NIGHT I FELL
IN LOVE WITH THE KID."

1:05:01.311 --> 1:05:04.935
BETWEEN FIGHTS HE CONTINUED
TO TALK, OFFERING A QUIP,

1:05:04.970 --> 1:05:08.801
POEM, OR PREDICTION TO
EVERY REPORTER HE COULD

1:05:08.835 --> 1:05:12.115
AND DOUBLING DOWN ON HIS
GUARANTEE THAT HE WOULD SOON

1:05:12.149 --> 1:05:16.084
BECOME THE YOUNGEST
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION EVER.

1:05:16.119 --> 1:05:19.329
MY LAST 3 FIGHTS, I PREDICTED
A 4-ROUND KNOCKOUT.

1:05:19.363 --> 1:05:21.745
I KNOCKED OUT SONNY BANKS
IN 4 ROUNDS,

1:05:21.779 --> 1:05:23.436
I KNOCKED OUT
DON WARNER IN 4 ROUNDS,

1:05:23.471 --> 1:05:27.993
AND I JUST ANNIHILATED
GEORGE LOGAN IN 4 ROUNDS.

1:05:28.027 --> 1:05:30.305
WHITE SPORTSWRITERS
STARTED CALLING HIM

1:05:30.340 --> 1:05:33.412
"MIGHTY MOUTH,"
"CASSIUS THE GASEOUS,"

1:05:33.446 --> 1:05:35.172
THE "LOUISVILLE LIP."

1:05:35.207 --> 1:05:38.003
NOTHING WOULD PLEASE PEOPLE
MORE, ONE REPORTER SAID,

1:05:38.037 --> 1:05:41.282
THAN TO SEE CASSIUS
"GAG ON A GLOVE."

1:05:41.316 --> 1:05:43.663
HE WAS RUDE,
RUDE TO HIS OPPONENTS.

1:05:43.698 --> 1:05:45.838
BEFORE A FIGHT HE WOULD
INSULT THEM,

1:05:45.872 --> 1:05:47.357
HE WOULD MOCK THEM,
HE WOULD PREDICT

1:05:47.391 --> 1:05:49.255
BAD THINGS FOR THEM.

1:05:49.290 --> 1:05:51.671
HE DIDN'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT LOSING IN THE EARLY DAYS.

1:05:51.706 --> 1:05:53.777
IT WASN'T PROPER BEHAVIOR.

1:05:53.811 --> 1:05:55.848
TO THEM, HE WAS
NOTHING LIKE THE REVERED

1:05:55.882 --> 1:06:00.197
FORMER CHAMPION OF THE 1930s
AND 1940S JOE LOUIS,

1:06:00.232 --> 1:06:03.338
WHOSE MANAGERS HAD DEMANDED
HE REFRAIN FROM CELEBRATING

1:06:03.373 --> 1:06:06.548
AFTER DEFEATING WHITE OPPONENTS.

1:06:06.583 --> 1:06:10.311
AND THESE GUYS,
THESE ELDERS, WERE OFFENDED

1:06:10.345 --> 1:06:13.003
BY THIS "GASEOUS CASSIUS."

1:06:13.038 --> 1:06:15.557
THEY JUST THOUGHT THAT
HE WAS IMPERTINENT,

1:06:15.592 --> 1:06:19.113
THAT HE OFFENDED THEIR SENSE
OF ATHLETIC AESTHETICS.

1:06:19.147 --> 1:06:20.735
"WHAT'S ALL THIS
PRANCING AROUND?

1:06:20.769 --> 1:06:22.495
STAND AND FIGHT!"

1:06:22.530 --> 1:06:25.119
THE SPORTSWRITERS
WERE MOSTLY OLDER MEN,

1:06:25.153 --> 1:06:26.844
WHITE MEN.

1:06:26.879 --> 1:06:28.467
NOW THERE WERE A FEW
OF US YOUNGER GUYS AROUND,

1:06:28.501 --> 1:06:29.882
AND WE LOVED HIM.

1:06:29.916 --> 1:06:31.194
IT WAS WONDERFUL.

1:06:31.228 --> 1:06:34.404
I WAS AROUND CASSIUS' AGE.

1:06:34.438 --> 1:06:36.199
IT WAS VERY EXCITING.

1:06:36.233 --> 1:06:38.649
MOST PEOPLE THINK
BECAUSE I CAN PREDICT

1:06:38.684 --> 1:06:40.893
A FIGHT LIKE THIS
AND MAKE IT COME TRUE,

1:06:40.927 --> 1:06:44.000
THEY THINK THAT I AM
BECOMING OVERCONFIDENT.

1:06:44.034 --> 1:06:46.174
I'M GUNNING FOR FLOYD PATTERSON
AND SONNY LISTON,

1:06:46.209 --> 1:06:49.591
AND IF THEY GET IN MY WAY,
I WILL ANNIHILATE THEM, ALSO.

1:06:49.626 --> 1:06:52.836
SO THERE'S THIS,--THIS SORT
OF MAINSTREAM SENSIBILITY

1:06:52.870 --> 1:06:56.391
ABOUT HOW A MAN SHOULD
CONDUCT HIMSELF IN PUBLIC,

1:06:56.426 --> 1:07:00.361
WHICH IS BASED PURELY ON THIS
SORT OF WHITE MALE LOGIC.

1:07:00.395 --> 1:07:02.501
CASSIUS CLAY'S ONE OF
THE FIRST PEOPLE TO COME ALONG

1:07:02.535 --> 1:07:04.054
IN PUBLIC AND SAY,
"I'M NOT GOING TO FOLLOW

1:07:04.089 --> 1:07:05.538
"THOSE RULES.

1:07:05.573 --> 1:07:08.921
I'M GOING TO SAY
AND DO WHAT I CHOOSE."

1:07:08.955 --> 1:07:11.924
IT'S ABOUT INDEPENDENCE.

1:07:11.958 --> 1:07:16.584
IN EARLY JUNE 1962,
ABDUL RAHMAN INVITED CASSIUS

1:07:16.618 --> 1:07:19.345
AND HIS BROTHER RUDY
TO A NATION OF ISLAM RALLY

1:07:19.380 --> 1:07:21.727
IN DETROIT LATER THAT MONTH.

1:07:21.761 --> 1:07:24.247
THOUGH PUBLICLY ASSOCIATING
WITH THE SECT COULD HARM

1:07:24.281 --> 1:07:27.353
CLAY'S CHANCES OF GETTING
A TITLE FIGHT,

1:07:27.388 --> 1:07:29.286
THE BROTHERS SAID YES.

1:07:29.321 --> 1:07:34.602
CLAY WAS IN LOUISVILLE,
HIS CAR WAS IN MIAMI,

1:07:34.636 --> 1:07:38.916
SO I DROVE HIS CAR FROM MIAMI
TO LOUISVILLE TO PICK HIM UP,

1:07:38.951 --> 1:07:41.574
AND WE DROVE FROM THERE
ON INTO DETROIT

1:07:41.609 --> 1:07:44.750
TO HEAR THE LECTURE OF
THE HONORABLE ELIJAH MUHAMMAD.

1:07:44.784 --> 1:07:47.201
BEFORE THE RALLY,
THE 3 VISITED THE LUNCHEONETTE

1:07:47.235 --> 1:07:49.720
NEXT DOOR TO MOSQUE NO. 1,

1:07:49.755 --> 1:07:51.619
WHERE THEY MET
A WELL-KNOWN MINISTER

1:07:51.653 --> 1:07:54.449
FROM NEW YORK WHO WAS IN TOWN
TO DELIVER OPENING REMARKS

1:07:54.484 --> 1:07:56.106
AT THE RALLY.

1:07:56.141 --> 1:07:58.281
HIS NAME WAS MALCOLM X.

1:07:58.315 --> 1:08:00.800
CLAY APPROACHED HIM,
ENTHUSIASTICALLY OFFERED

1:08:00.835 --> 1:08:04.080
HIS HAND,
AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF.

1:08:04.114 --> 1:08:06.082
WHEN MALCOLM MET
CASSIUS CLAY,

1:08:06.116 --> 1:08:08.601
HE'D NEVER HEARD OF HIM,
WAS NOT MUCH OF A BOXING FAN.

1:08:08.636 --> 1:08:10.983
THE NATION OF ISLAM
DISCOURAGED ITS MEMBERS

1:08:11.017 --> 1:08:13.503
FROM PARTICIPATING
IN SPORT AND ENTERTAINMENT.

1:08:13.537 --> 1:08:15.470
THEY DIDN'T THINK IT
WAS SERIOUS ENOUGH.

1:08:15.505 --> 1:08:17.023
IT WAS SEEN AS A DISTRACTION.

1:08:17.058 --> 1:08:20.234
SO HE DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE CASSIUS CLAY.

1:08:20.268 --> 1:08:22.305
AFTER A BRIEF CHAT,
MALCOLM RETURNED

1:08:22.339 --> 1:08:24.514
TO PREPARING FOR HIS ADDRESS,

1:08:24.548 --> 1:08:27.241
BUT THE YOUNG FIGHTER
HAD LEFT AN IMPRESSION.

1:08:27.275 --> 1:08:30.623
CLAY HAD A "CONTAGIOUS QUALITY,"
MALCOLM LATER RECALLED.

1:08:30.658 --> 1:08:33.868
HE WAS "CLEAN CUT
AND DOWN TO EARTH."

1:08:33.902 --> 1:08:35.766
THEY QUICKLY DEVELOPED
A FRIENDSHIP AND A BOND,

1:08:35.801 --> 1:08:38.804
AND MALCOLM BECAME
A VERY IMPORTANT TEACHER

1:08:38.838 --> 1:08:41.496
FOR CASSIUS, UH, TEACHING
HIM ABOUT THE NATION OF ISLAM

1:08:41.531 --> 1:08:43.602
AND ABOUT WHAT
THE RELIGION MEANT.

1:08:43.636 --> 1:08:46.329
THEY BECAME GOOD FRIENDS.

1:08:46.363 --> 1:08:49.055
BORN IN 1925
TO PARENTS WHO FOLLOWED

1:08:49.090 --> 1:08:52.162
THE BLACK SEPARATIST
LEADER MARCUS GARVEY,

1:08:52.197 --> 1:08:54.992
MALCOLM LITTLE WAS INTRODUCED
TO THE NATION OF ISLAM

1:08:55.027 --> 1:08:57.685
IN THE LATE 1940s
WHILE SERVING TIME

1:08:57.719 --> 1:09:01.999
IN A MASSACHUSETTS PRISON
FOR BURGLARY.

1:09:02.034 --> 1:09:05.002
DEEPLY AFFECTED
BY ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S TEACHINGS,

1:09:05.037 --> 1:09:07.798
LITTLE WROTE TO THE LEADER
ALMOST DAILY

1:09:07.833 --> 1:09:11.526
AND TOOK THE NAME MALCOLM X.

1:09:11.561 --> 1:09:14.080
LATER AFTER HIS RELEASE
FROM PRISON,

1:09:14.115 --> 1:09:16.497
MUHAMMAD WOULD MAKE HIM
PRINCIPAL MINISTER

1:09:16.531 --> 1:09:19.534
AT TEMPLE NO. 7 IN HARLEM.

1:09:19.569 --> 1:09:20.984
WHO ARE YOU?

1:09:21.018 --> 1:09:22.503
YOU DON'T KNOW.

1:09:22.537 --> 1:09:25.195
DON'T TELL ME NEGRO.
THAT'S NOTHING.

1:09:25.230 --> 1:09:26.645
WHAT WERE YOU BEFORE
THE WHITE MAN NAMED

1:09:26.679 --> 1:09:28.198
YOU A NEGRO?

1:09:28.233 --> 1:09:29.820
AND WHERE WERE YOU?

1:09:29.855 --> 1:09:31.684
AND WHAT DID YOU HAVE?

1:09:31.719 --> 1:09:33.307
WHAT WAS YOURS?

1:09:33.341 --> 1:09:35.654
WHAT LANGUAGE DID YOU
SPEAK THEN?

1:09:35.688 --> 1:09:37.207
WHAT WAS YOUR NAME?

1:09:37.242 --> 1:09:39.899
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN SMITH
OR JONES

1:09:39.934 --> 1:09:41.246
OR BUNCH OR POWELL.

1:09:41.280 --> 1:09:43.006
THAT WASN'T YOUR NAME.

1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:44.249
THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE KIND
OF NAMES WHERE YOU AND I

1:09:44.283 --> 1:09:46.251
CAME FROM.

1:09:46.285 --> 1:09:50.324
WHEN MALCOLM CAME
ALONG, HIS CHARISMA WAS MARRIED

1:09:50.358 --> 1:09:53.223
TO ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S
PURITANICAL MESSAGE,

1:09:53.258 --> 1:09:55.225
AND IT TOOK OFF.

1:09:55.260 --> 1:09:57.365
I WAS MESMERIZED BY THE GUY.

1:09:57.400 --> 1:09:59.264
AMERICA IS
STILL A COUNTRY

1:09:59.298 --> 1:10:02.508
WHOSE GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM
IS BASED UPON FREEDOM,

1:10:02.543 --> 1:10:05.891
JUSTICE, AND EQUALITY
FOR WHITE PEOPLE ONLY.

1:10:05.925 --> 1:10:09.101
AND I COULDN'T IMAGINE
ANYONE BESTING HIM

1:10:09.135 --> 1:10:11.241
IN AN INTELLECTUAL ARGUMENT.

1:10:11.276 --> 1:10:12.553
YOU HAVEN'T DONE
THE RIGHT THING...

1:10:12.587 --> 1:10:13.795
HE WAS THAT SHARP.

1:10:13.830 --> 1:10:15.452
BY MY PEOPLE,

1:10:15.487 --> 1:10:17.351
AND BECAUSE YOU
HAVEN'T DONE THE RIGHT THING

1:10:17.385 --> 1:10:21.700
BY MY PEOPLE, NOW I GOT TO DO
THE RIGHT THING BY YOU.

1:10:21.734 --> 1:10:24.392
YOUR KINGDOM HAS GOT TO GO.

1:10:24.427 --> 1:10:26.705
OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE
HAD INTELLECTUAL ATTAINMENT,

1:10:26.739 --> 1:10:28.638
THEY DISDAINED,
THE STREET LIFE,

1:10:28.672 --> 1:10:31.537
AND THEY HAD THIS
AURA OF SUPERIORITY.

1:10:31.572 --> 1:10:33.919
MALCOLM, HE DIDN'T
HAVE THAT AT ALL.

1:10:33.953 --> 1:10:35.886
HE SEEMED TO EMBRACE
THE STREET LIFE IN A WAY

1:10:35.921 --> 1:10:37.267
THAT FEW OTHERS HAD,

1:10:37.302 --> 1:10:40.788
AND THAT WAS
A VERY UNIQUE THING.

1:10:40.822 --> 1:10:42.755
MANY AMERICANS,
NOW FAMILIAR

1:10:42.790 --> 1:10:45.965
WITH THE NON-VIOLENT ACTIONS
OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT

1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:49.106
LED PRIMARILY BY SOUTHERN
MINISTERS, WERE SHOCKED

1:10:49.141 --> 1:10:51.902
AND FRIGHTENED BY WHAT
MALCOLM X HAD TO SAY.

1:10:51.937 --> 1:10:54.733
NO MAN CAN
SPEAK FOR NEGROES WHO TELLS

1:10:54.767 --> 1:10:57.391
NEGROES LOVE THEIR ENEMY.

1:10:57.425 --> 1:11:00.946
NO MAN CAN SPEAK
FOR NEGROES WHO TELLS NEGROES

1:11:00.980 --> 1:11:02.948
TURN THE OTHER CHEEK.

1:11:02.982 --> 1:11:05.744
THERE IS NO NEGRO
IN HIS RIGHT MIND TODAY

1:11:05.778 --> 1:11:09.506
WHO IS GOING TO TURN
THE OTHER CHEEK.

1:11:09.541 --> 1:11:11.474
AS MALCOLM'S
INFLUENCE GREW,

1:11:11.508 --> 1:11:15.029
HIS ACTIVITIES DREW INCREASING
INTEREST FROM THE FBI,

1:11:15.063 --> 1:11:18.274
WHICH BEGAN TRACKING
HIS EVERY MOVE,

1:11:18.308 --> 1:11:22.933
SURVEILLANCE THAT WOULD CONTINUE
UNTIL THE END OF HIS LIFE.

1:11:22.968 --> 1:11:24.521
STOP TRYING TO BE IN UNITY

1:11:24.556 --> 1:11:26.592
WITH THE PEOPLE THAT
DON'T WANT YOU.

1:11:26.627 --> 1:11:29.595
THEY HATE YOU AND CALL
YOU THESE BLACK

1:11:29.630 --> 1:11:31.045
SO AND SO AND SO.

1:11:31.079 --> 1:11:33.219
GET OUT OF THAT
PEOPLE'S FAITH.

1:11:33.254 --> 1:11:35.498
AT THE RALLY
IN DETROIT THAT CASSIUS, RUDY,

1:11:35.532 --> 1:11:38.052
AND ABDUL RAHMAN
HAD DRIVEN TO,

1:11:38.086 --> 1:11:41.814
THE BROTHERS HUNG
ON ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S EVERY WORD.

1:11:41.849 --> 1:11:43.816
HE IS THROUGH WITH YOU AND I.

1:11:43.851 --> 1:11:45.197
HE HAS FREED YOU AND I.

1:11:45.231 --> 1:11:47.061
LET'S ACT LIKE FREE MEN.

1:11:47.095 --> 1:11:50.064
DO FOR OUR FREE SELVES.

1:11:50.098 --> 1:11:53.723
IF CASSIUS COMES OUT
AND SAYS, "YES, I'M A MEMBER

1:11:53.757 --> 1:11:57.071
OF THE NATION OF ISLAM,"
HIS CAREER IS OVER.

1:11:57.105 --> 1:12:00.212
YOU KNOW, I MEAN BOXING IS
IN THE DOLDRUMS ANYWAY.

1:12:00.246 --> 1:12:04.320
JUST WHAT WE NEED NOW,
A TOP CONTENDER AFFIRMING

1:12:04.354 --> 1:12:06.701
HIS BELIEF
IN THE NATION OF ISLAM.

1:12:06.736 --> 1:12:09.083
HE'S NOT GOING TO ATTRACT
ANY BIG FIGHTS.

1:12:09.117 --> 1:12:10.843
WHITE AMERICA IS NOT
GOING TO GIVE

1:12:10.878 --> 1:12:13.743
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP
TO A BLACK MUSLIM.

1:12:13.777 --> 1:12:17.471
CLAY HAD TO PLAY IT VERY COY.

1:12:17.505 --> 1:12:19.852
IN JULY,
CASSIUS CLAY PREDICTED HE'D

1:12:19.887 --> 1:12:23.753
KNOCK OUT AN ARGENTINE CONTENDER
NAMED ALEJANDRO LAVORANTE

1:12:23.787 --> 1:12:26.997
IN THE FIFTH ROUND
AND THEN ONCE AGAIN

1:12:27.032 --> 1:12:29.206
MADE GOOD ON THAT PREDICTION.

1:12:29.241 --> 1:12:31.864
HE WAS NOW 15-0.

1:12:31.899 --> 1:12:34.522
AFTER THE MATCH,
CLAY SPOTTED ARCHIE MOORE

1:12:34.557 --> 1:12:35.937
AT RINGSIDE.

1:12:35.972 --> 1:12:37.076
"YOU'RE NEXT, OLD MAN"
HE SHOUTED

1:12:37.111 --> 1:12:39.907
TO HIS ONE-TIME TRAINER.

1:12:39.941 --> 1:12:42.737
MOORE CLAIMED TO BE 45,
THOUGH MANY BELIEVE

1:12:42.772 --> 1:12:44.739
HE WAS CLOSER TO 50,

1:12:44.774 --> 1:12:47.052
BUT HE NEEDED THE MONEY
AND QUICKLY AGREED

1:12:47.086 --> 1:12:49.123
TO THE FIGHT.

1:12:49.157 --> 1:12:52.195
ARCHIE MOORE WAS LIKE
THE PROFESSOR OF FIGHTERS.

1:12:52.229 --> 1:12:54.508
ARCHIE MOORE WAS INCREDIBLY
BRILLIANT,

1:12:54.542 --> 1:12:57.925
BUT ARCHIE MOORE HAD THE VANITY
OF THINKING

1:12:57.959 --> 1:12:59.858
THAT HE COULD FIGURE OUT
THE YOUNG GUY

1:12:59.892 --> 1:13:02.378
AND THROUGH POSITIONING HIMSELF
RIGHT AND MOVING RIGHT

1:13:02.412 --> 1:13:06.416
HE COULD OUTSMART
THIS YOUNG GUY.

1:13:06.451 --> 1:13:10.420
LET'S JUST SAY THE PREROGATIVES
OF YOUTH OVERCAME HIM.

1:13:10.455 --> 1:13:14.182
CLAY WON BY TECHNICAL
KNOCKOUT IN THE FOURTH ROUND.

1:13:16.012 --> 1:13:19.981
BY THE END OF 1962,
CASSIUS CLAY WAS RANKED NUMBER 4

1:13:20.016 --> 1:13:23.260
AMONG HEAVYWEIGHT CONTENDERS,
AND HE HAD BEGUN

1:13:23.295 --> 1:13:27.057
TO LOOK LIKE A SHREWD BET
BY HIS LOUISVILLE SPONSORS,

1:13:27.092 --> 1:13:29.922
WHO WERE ON PACE TO RECOUP
THEIR INITIAL INVESTMENT

1:13:29.957 --> 1:13:32.131
IN THE COMING YEAR.

1:13:32.166 --> 1:13:34.617
MR. CASSIUS CLAY,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

1:13:38.344 --> 1:13:39.760
JERRY, I'M
THE GREATEST FIGHTER

1:13:39.794 --> 1:13:41.140
THAT'S EVER STEPPED
FOOT IN THE RING.

1:13:41.175 --> 1:13:42.590
I'M SO GREAT, I TELL
A CLOWN WHAT ROUND

1:13:42.625 --> 1:13:44.454
HE'S GOING DOWN.

1:13:44.489 --> 1:13:46.422
YOU SEEM
TO BE MAKING PREDICTIONS
ABOUT FIGHTS.

1:13:46.456 --> 1:13:47.906
THAT'S PART
OF THE CLAY PSYCHOLOGY

1:13:47.940 --> 1:13:50.426
AND ALSO PART OF
THE CLAY GREATNESS.

1:13:50.460 --> 1:13:51.910
AND THE
CLAY GREATNESS.

1:13:51.944 --> 1:13:53.187
WELL, NOW YOU CLAIM TO BE
YOU'RE GOING TO BE

1:13:53.221 --> 1:13:54.844
THE NEXT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD.

1:13:54.878 --> 1:13:56.432
NEXT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD.

1:13:56.466 --> 1:13:57.950
I'LL HOLD THE TITLE
FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS

1:13:57.985 --> 1:14:00.263
AND THEN GIVE IT TO MY
YOUNGER BROTHER RUDOLPH.

1:14:00.297 --> 1:14:01.747
THOUGH CRITICS
GRUMBLED

1:14:01.782 --> 1:14:03.300
THAT HE STILL TALKED TOO MUCH

1:14:03.335 --> 1:14:05.855
AND HADN'T YET FACED
A WORTHY OPPONENT,

1:14:05.889 --> 1:14:09.445
CASSIUS CLAY HAD
THE BOXING WORLD'S ATTENTION.

1:14:09.479 --> 1:14:11.481
"I DON'T CARE IF THIS KID
CAN'T FIGHT A LICK,"

1:14:11.516 --> 1:14:14.484
SAID THE FORMER HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION JACK DEMPSEY.

1:14:14.519 --> 1:14:16.175
"I'M FOR HIM.

1:14:16.210 --> 1:14:18.005
THINGS ARE LIVE AGAIN."

1:14:22.872 --> 1:14:27.635
FRED Mc

1:14:38.439 --> 1:14:44.652
POOR MEN BOX BECAUSE
IT'S THE ONLY CHOICE THEY HAVE,

1:14:44.687 --> 1:14:49.657
WHICH IS THE REASON THAT
BOXING ITSELF IS POETRY.

1:14:49.692 --> 1:14:51.348
"WHY YOU WANT TO GET
IN THE RING AND GET HURT?"

1:14:51.383 --> 1:14:53.730
SAID, "MAN, I CAN
GO DOWN TO THE BAR AND GET HURT.

1:14:53.765 --> 1:14:55.421
"YOU KNOW, I CAN GO DOWN
THERE TO THE JUKE JOINT

1:14:55.456 --> 1:14:57.493
AND LISTEN TO
ROBERT JOHNSON AND GET HURT."

1:14:57.527 --> 1:14:59.046
HE SAID, "AT LEAST WHEN
I GET IN THE RING,

1:14:59.080 --> 1:15:01.220
"THEY PAY ME,

1:15:01.255 --> 1:15:04.879
AND THEY GOT TO WEAR
GLOVES WHEN THEY HIT ME."

1:15:06.778 --> 1:15:10.747
YOU FIGHT BECAUSE YOU
FIGHT EVERY DAY ANYWAY.

1:15:10.782 --> 1:15:12.749
A BLACK MAN,
BUT NOT JUST BLACK MEN,

1:15:12.784 --> 1:15:17.547
ANY POOR--A MEXICAN OR IRISHMAN
OR JEW--IF THEY'RE FIGHTING,

1:15:17.582 --> 1:15:21.827
THEY'RE FIGHTING
FOR THEIR LIVES,

1:15:21.862 --> 1:15:23.898
AND THE ONLY REASON THEY'RE
FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES

1:15:23.933 --> 1:15:27.764
IN THE RING IS BECAUSE IT'S
A LITTLE BIT SAFER

1:15:27.799 --> 1:15:33.563
THAN FIGHTING FOR YOUR LIFE
ON THE STREETS OF AMERICA.

1:15:33.598 --> 1:15:36.773
IN SEPTEMBER 1962,
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION

1:15:36.808 --> 1:15:39.086
FLOYD PATTERSON
WAS SCHEDULED TO FIGHT

1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:43.849
CHALLENGER SONNY LISTON
AT CHICAGO'S COMISKEY PARK.

1:15:43.884 --> 1:15:46.369
PATTERSON WAS
THE SENTIMENTAL FAVORITE,

1:15:46.403 --> 1:15:48.682
BUT THE ODDS WERE AGAINST HIM.

1:15:48.716 --> 1:15:51.374
FLOYD PATTERSON WAS
A REMARKABLE FIGHTER

1:15:51.408 --> 1:15:53.031
BECAUSE HE WAS
A HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION

1:15:53.065 --> 1:15:54.791
WITHOUT BEING A HEAVYWEIGHT.

1:15:54.826 --> 1:15:56.690
PATTERSON HAD A HUMILITY
ABOUT HIM

1:15:56.724 --> 1:16:00.072
AND A CERTAIN RIGHTEOUSNESS
ABOUT HIM THAT HE APPEALED

1:16:00.107 --> 1:16:01.695
TO THE WHITE MIDDLE CLASS,

1:16:01.729 --> 1:16:06.078
THE WHITE SPORTSWRITER,
THE WHITE ELEMENT.

1:16:06.113 --> 1:16:09.047
I MET THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

1:16:09.081 --> 1:16:11.912
HE KNEW
OF MY FIGHT WITH LISTON,

1:16:11.946 --> 1:16:16.226
AND HE HAD SAID TO ME, UH,
YOU KNOW, "FLOYD,

1:16:16.261 --> 1:16:18.125
"YOU WANT TO TRY TO KEEP
THE TITLE BECAUSE YOU REPRESENT

1:16:18.159 --> 1:16:21.473
SOMETHING GOOD."

1:16:21.507 --> 1:16:23.717
FLOYD'S MANAGER
WAS CUS D'AMATO,

1:16:23.751 --> 1:16:28.584
AND HE DISCOVERED
VERY EARLY THAT FLOYD REALLY HAD

1:16:28.618 --> 1:16:34.279
THE QUICK HANDS OF A COBRA
AND THE CHIN OF A POET.

1:16:34.313 --> 1:16:36.661
HE DIDN'T WANT HIM TO
FIGHT SONNY LISTON.

1:16:36.695 --> 1:16:38.628
DEFINITELY DID NOT WANT
HIM TO FIGHT SONNY LISTON.

1:16:38.663 --> 1:16:42.011
FLOYD WAS BAITED INTO
THE FIGHT BECAUSE HE DECIDED

1:16:42.045 --> 1:16:44.461
HE WAS DEPUTIZED TO GET RID
OF ALL BULLIES

1:16:44.496 --> 1:16:46.636
AND WHATEVER ELSE.

1:16:46.671 --> 1:16:48.742
CASSIUS, IN ABOUT
A MONTH FROM NOW,

1:16:48.776 --> 1:16:50.364
SONNY LISTON IS GOING TO
BE TRYING TO GET

1:16:50.398 --> 1:16:52.849
THE CHAMPIONSHIP
FROM FLOYD PATTERSON.

1:16:52.884 --> 1:16:54.437
HOW DO YOU SEE
THIS FIGHT?

1:16:54.471 --> 1:16:55.818
TRYING TO GET?

1:16:55.852 --> 1:16:57.682
SONNY LISTON
WILL GET IT.

1:16:57.716 --> 1:16:59.511
I SEE SONNY LISTON
KNOCKING
FLOYD PATTERSON OUT

1:16:59.545 --> 1:17:01.996
WITHIN THE FIRST
5 ROUNDS.

1:17:02.031 --> 1:17:05.621
IN MY ESTIMATION,
SONNY LISTON IS

1:17:05.655 --> 1:17:09.314
A GREAT AMERICAN HERO.

1:17:09.348 --> 1:17:12.558
HE HAD TAKEN ALL
THE WORST FROM EVERYBODY.

1:17:12.593 --> 1:17:15.665
HE'S A MAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW
WHEN HE WAS BORN,

1:17:15.700 --> 1:17:18.944
DOESN'T, HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP
WHATSOEVER WITH HIS FATHER,

1:17:18.979 --> 1:17:22.120
HAD A MOTHER WHO KEPT ON
RUNNING AWAY FROM HIM.

1:17:22.154 --> 1:17:25.226
HE WAS A MAN
OF EXTRAORDINARY POWER

1:17:25.261 --> 1:17:29.541
AND AN EXTRAORDINARY FOCUS,
WHO TOOK ALL THE BARBS

1:17:29.575 --> 1:17:34.028
AND ARROWS THAT
EVERYBODY HAD TO THROW

1:17:34.063 --> 1:17:36.686
AND STILL MADE IT.

1:17:36.721 --> 1:17:39.378
BOXING IS THAT GUY,
LIKE LISTON, WHO JUST BASICALLY

1:17:39.413 --> 1:17:41.967
CLIMBS RIGHT UP
OUT OF THE MUD.

1:17:42.002 --> 1:17:45.074
THEY SAY, "WHERE ARE YOU FROM?"
HE SAID, "I'M FROM BACK THERE."

1:17:45.108 --> 1:17:46.454
YOU KNOW.

1:17:49.181 --> 1:17:51.563
THE SON
OF AN ARKANSAS SHARECROPPER

1:17:51.597 --> 1:17:55.878
WHO WHIPPED HIM ALMOST DAILY,
CHARLES "SONNY" LISTON WAS

1:17:55.912 --> 1:18:00.227
FIRST INTRODUCED TO BOXING
IN 1950 BY A PRISON CHAPLAIN

1:18:00.261 --> 1:18:02.747
AT MISSOURI STATE
PENITENTIARY, WHERE HE WAS

1:18:02.781 --> 1:18:05.888
SERVING TIME
FOR ARMED ROBBERY.

1:18:05.922 --> 1:18:09.995
WITHIN 4 WEEKS, NO INMATES,
INCLUDING TRAINED BOXERS,

1:18:10.030 --> 1:18:13.274
WOULD GET IN
THE RING WITH HIM.

1:18:13.309 --> 1:18:17.002
HE WAS PAROLED
IN OCTOBER OF 1952.

1:18:17.037 --> 1:18:21.006
A LOCAL MOB BOSS GOT LISTON
A JOB AT AN ORDNANCE PLANT

1:18:21.041 --> 1:18:24.044
AND ENTERED HIM
IN AMATEUR TOURNAMENTS.

1:18:24.078 --> 1:18:27.254
4 MONTHS LATER, AFTER
CAPTURING THE INTERNATIONAL

1:18:27.288 --> 1:18:29.739
GOLDEN GLOVES
HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE,

1:18:29.774 --> 1:18:32.190
LISTON TURNED PROFESSIONAL.

1:18:32.224 --> 1:18:35.296
OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS,
HE WORKED IN CONSTRUCTION

1:18:35.331 --> 1:18:37.954
AND AS A CHAUFFEUR
AND SOMETIME ENFORCER

1:18:37.989 --> 1:18:40.716
FOR THE UNION BOSSES.

1:18:40.750 --> 1:18:43.926
HE WAS HARASSED CONSTANTLY
BY ST. LOUIS POLICE,

1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:46.066
WHO PICKED HIM UP
FOR "QUESTIONING"

1:18:46.100 --> 1:18:49.310
MORE THAN 100 TIMES.

1:18:49.345 --> 1:18:52.417
IN THE RING, SONNY LISTON
WAS NEARLY UNBEATABLE,

1:18:52.451 --> 1:18:55.247
USING WHAT ONE REPORTER
CALLED "A PILE DRIVER"

1:18:55.282 --> 1:19:02.323
OF A LEFT HAND TO WIN 17 OF HIS
FIRST 18 PROFESSIONAL FIGHTS.

1:19:02.358 --> 1:19:05.810
AS LISTON CLIMBED THE RANKS,
FRANK CARBO,

1:19:05.844 --> 1:19:09.468
A MOB HITMAN WHO BECAME
A POWERFUL BOXING PROMOTER,

1:19:09.503 --> 1:19:13.679
TOOK AN INTEREST AND APPROACHED
THE SMALL-TIME MOBSTER

1:19:13.714 --> 1:19:15.992
WHO THOUGHT HE OWNED LISTON.

1:19:16.027 --> 1:19:19.168
FRANKIE CARBO,
WHO'S RUNNING BOXING SAID,

1:19:19.202 --> 1:19:20.963
"HERE'S 75,000.

1:19:20.997 --> 1:19:22.654
"YOU NEVER SAW LISTON.

1:19:22.688 --> 1:19:24.138
"YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
SEE HIM AGAIN.

1:19:24.173 --> 1:19:26.796
FORGET IT.
HE'S MY FIGHTER."

1:19:26.831 --> 1:19:28.764
HE WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE MOB,
AND THE MOB TREATED HIM

1:19:28.798 --> 1:19:30.800
PRETTY WELL.

1:19:30.835 --> 1:19:33.423
SONNY WAS ILLITERATE,
BUT BY NO MEANS

1:19:33.458 --> 1:19:36.150
WAS SONNY IGNORANT.

1:19:36.185 --> 1:19:38.912
I THINK PEOPLE HATED
LISTON BECAUSE HE WAS A BRUTE.

1:19:38.946 --> 1:19:41.293
THEY HATED HIM BECAUSE
HE WAS DEADLY

1:19:41.328 --> 1:19:42.950
AND HE WAS DANGEROUS.

1:19:42.985 --> 1:19:45.366
THEY HATED HIM BECAUSE
OF THE CORRUPT COUNTRY

1:19:45.401 --> 1:19:46.954
THEY CREATED.

1:19:46.989 --> 1:19:48.680
THAT CORRUPTION CO-OPTED HIM.

1:19:48.714 --> 1:19:50.440
THEY HATED HIM BECAUSE HE
WAS ILLITERATE,

1:19:50.475 --> 1:19:52.926
BUT THEY DIDN'T TEACH HIM HOW
TO READ AND WRITE.

1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:56.722
HE'S HATED BY WHITE PEOPLE
AND BLACK PEOPLE,

1:19:56.757 --> 1:19:58.138
AND HE JUST NEVER STOPPED.

1:19:58.172 --> 1:19:59.864
HE JUST KEPT RIGHT ON GOING,

1:19:59.898 --> 1:20:02.694
AND IF YOU'RE LIKE A BLACK
MAN OR A WOMAN IN AMERICA

1:20:02.728 --> 1:20:04.800
AND YOU SEE SOMEBODY LIKE
SONNY LISTON, YOU SAY,

1:20:04.834 --> 1:20:09.459
"THAT'S WHAT THEY DO TO US."

1:20:09.494 --> 1:20:11.841
BY THE TIME LISTON
CHALLENGED FLOYD PATTERSON

1:20:11.876 --> 1:20:14.637
FOR THE HEAVYWEIGHT TITLE
IN 1962,

1:20:14.671 --> 1:20:19.159
HE HAD 33 WINS
AND JUST 1 LOSS.

1:20:19.193 --> 1:20:21.057
"PATTERSON WAS
THE MORAL FAVORITE,"

1:20:21.092 --> 1:20:23.646
THE WRITER
JAMES BALDWIN OBSERVED.

1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:27.305
"PEOPLE FELT LISTON'S
VICTORY WOULD BE A DISASTER."

1:20:27.339 --> 1:20:30.756
WEIGHING 214 POUNDS,

1:20:30.791 --> 1:20:35.900
FROM PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA,
SONNY LISTON.

1:20:37.591 --> 1:20:39.765
SONNY LISTON
UNDERSTOOD.

1:20:39.800 --> 1:20:42.147
"IT'S LIKE A COWBOY
MOVIE," HE SAID.

1:20:42.182 --> 1:20:44.218
"THERE'S GOT TO BE GOOD GUYS,

1:20:44.253 --> 1:20:48.705
AND THERE'S GOT TO BE BAD GUYS."

1:20:50.431 --> 1:20:52.192
SONNY LISTON MOVES OUT TO FACE

1:20:52.226 --> 1:20:56.713
THE BIG CHANCE OF HIS 28 YEARS
OF A TURBULENT LIFE.

1:20:56.748 --> 1:20:58.715
THE LISTON HOOK TO THE HEAD
IS THE FIRST GOOD PUNCH

1:20:58.750 --> 1:21:00.821
OF THE FIGHT.

1:21:04.618 --> 1:21:06.585
A LEFT TO GRAZING RIGHT
AND A SOLID LEFT

1:21:06.620 --> 1:21:10.003
TO THE CHEEKBONE DROPPED
THE CHAMPION.

1:21:10.037 --> 1:21:13.247
IT TOOK LISTON
JUST 2 MINUTES AND 6 SECONDS

1:21:13.282 --> 1:21:17.942
TO BECOME HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD.

1:21:17.976 --> 1:21:19.805
IT WAS CLEAR TO ME
THAT NOBODY WOULD EVER BEAT

1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:21.600
SONNY LISTON AND THAT HE
WOULD BE 107

1:21:21.635 --> 1:21:24.500
AND HE WOULD RETIRE
AS THE UNDEFEATED CHAMPION.

1:21:27.813 --> 1:21:31.196
BOXING WAS IN
THE WINTER OF ITS DISCONTENT.

1:21:31.231 --> 1:21:34.199
RUMORS THAT
EVERYTHING'S FIXED.

1:21:34.234 --> 1:21:37.375
PARET AGAINST
THE ROPES, ALMOST HELPLESS.

1:21:37.409 --> 1:21:39.929
A MINUTE TO GO.

1:21:39.964 --> 1:21:42.138
AND THEY'RE GONNA STOP IT.

1:21:42.173 --> 1:21:44.416
THEY'RE GONNA STOP IT
AS PARET SAGS...

1:21:44.451 --> 1:21:46.384
AND ANOTHER MAJOR
PROBLEM THAT HAD WAS JUST

1:21:46.418 --> 1:21:49.076
THE SHEER VIOLENCE OF THE SPORT.

1:21:49.111 --> 1:21:50.767
WE'RE MORE CONCERNED

1:21:50.802 --> 1:21:53.115
ABOUT THE CONDITION
OF BENNY "KID" PARET.

1:21:53.149 --> 1:21:55.289
YOU HAD FIGHTS
ON TELEVISION

1:21:55.324 --> 1:21:57.084
THAT STARTLED AMERICANS.

1:21:57.119 --> 1:21:59.845
YOU KNOW,
"DO WE WANT TO WATCH THIS?

1:21:59.880 --> 1:22:03.642
WE'VE GOT TO BAN THIS SPORT."

1:22:03.677 --> 1:22:07.439
ON FEBRUARY 4, 1963,
CASSIUS CLAY TRAVELED

1:22:07.474 --> 1:22:10.339
TO ALBANY, NEW YORK,
TO APPEAR AS A WITNESS

1:22:10.373 --> 1:22:12.962
BEFORE A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE
CONSIDERING A BILL

1:22:12.997 --> 1:22:16.241
THAT WOULD ABOLISH BOXING
IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK

1:22:16.276 --> 1:22:19.935
BECAUSE OF ITS BRUTALITY
AND EVER-PRESENT CORRUPTION.

1:22:19.969 --> 1:22:21.695
DON'T YOU THINK THAT

1:22:21.729 --> 1:22:23.317
THESE PREDICTIONS THAT YOU'RE
MAKING AND THE FACT

1:22:23.352 --> 1:22:25.802
THAT THE LAST FEW FIGHTS
HAVE HAPPENED TO END

1:22:25.837 --> 1:22:28.805
IN THE EXACT ROUND THAT YOU
STATE HAVE CREATED

1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:31.636
A BAD IMAGE TO THE GENERAL
PUBLIC OF BOXING?

1:22:31.670 --> 1:22:35.536
WELL, NO, IT HAVEN'T.
A FEW PEOPLE--

1:22:35.571 --> 1:22:36.986
WELL, IN OTHER WORDS, THEY SAY,

1:22:37.021 --> 1:22:38.850
"IT TAKE A CROOK TO
KNOW A CROOK."

1:22:38.884 --> 1:22:41.335
NOW, YOU PROVE...

1:22:44.511 --> 1:22:48.515
CASSIUS CLAY COMES LIKE
A BREATH OF SPRING AIR.

1:22:48.549 --> 1:22:52.312
YES, HE'S OUTRAGEOUS.
YES, HE'S CONCEITED.

1:22:52.346 --> 1:22:55.901
YES, HE BOASTS CONSTANTLY,
BUT HE'S EXCITING,

1:22:55.936 --> 1:22:59.388
AND HE'S GOOD-LOOKING,
AND HE'S YOUNG.

1:22:59.422 --> 1:23:00.872
BY THE WAY, CASSIUS,

1:23:00.906 --> 1:23:02.632
I THINK THAT POINT WAS
WELL TAKEN,

1:23:02.667 --> 1:23:05.118
AND I THINK THAT MY COLLEAGUES
IN THE LEGISLATURE

1:23:05.152 --> 1:23:07.361
GOT A LITTLE FUN OUT OF IT,
BUT GO AHEAD.

1:23:07.396 --> 1:23:09.294
I HAVE HAD 11 FIGHTS,
11 OF THEM

1:23:09.329 --> 1:23:11.365
I PREDICTED JUST
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

1:23:11.400 --> 1:23:13.712
NOW WOULD YOU SAY ALL
OF THESE PEOPLE ARE CROOKS,

1:23:13.747 --> 1:23:15.576
ALL OF
THE PROMOTERS ARE CROOKS?

1:23:15.611 --> 1:23:17.337
I ASKED YOU THE QUESTION.

1:23:17.371 --> 1:23:18.994
WELL, THAT'S JUST
UP TO YOU TO FIGURE.

1:23:19.028 --> 1:23:21.065
I TELL THE PEOPLE
THAT I'M THE GREATEST,

1:23:21.099 --> 1:23:23.826
SO IF I SAY HE'S GONNA FALL
IN 5 AND HE FALLS IN 5,

1:23:23.860 --> 1:23:26.829
WELL, THAT JUST MAKES ME
THAT MUCH GREATER.

1:23:26.863 --> 1:23:29.004
CLAY ALSO
PROMISED THE LEGISLATORS

1:23:29.038 --> 1:23:31.075
THAT HE WOULD SELL OUT
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

1:23:31.109 --> 1:23:34.216
FOR HIS UPCOMING FIGHT WITH
THE NUMBER-3 RANKED CONTENDER

1:23:34.250 --> 1:23:37.702
DOUG JONES, A FEAT NO EVENT HELD
AT THE ARENA

1:23:37.736 --> 1:23:41.499
HAD ACHIEVED IN YEARS.

1:23:41.533 --> 1:23:44.433
ON THE TRAIN BACK
FROM ALBANY TO NEW YORK CITY,

1:23:44.467 --> 1:23:48.057
A REPORTER WARNED CLAY THAT
A MONTHS-LONG PRINTERS STRIKE

1:23:48.092 --> 1:23:50.163
THAT HAD SHUTTERED MOST
OF THE CITY'S

1:23:50.197 --> 1:23:52.958
MAJOR DAILY NEWSPAPERS COULD
MAKE IT DIFFICULT

1:23:52.993 --> 1:23:55.513
TO PUBLICIZE THE FIGHT.

1:23:55.547 --> 1:23:57.687
CLAY WAS UNDETERRED.

1:23:57.722 --> 1:24:00.932
HE BEGAN A RELENTLESS
PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN.

1:24:00.966 --> 1:24:02.347
ARE
YOU STILL PLUGGING
THE LINE THAT YOU ARE

1:24:02.382 --> 1:24:03.969
THE GREATEST
HEAVYWEIGHT ALIVE?

1:24:04.004 --> 1:24:05.902
I'M THE GREATEST
HEAVYWEIGHT
ON TWO FEET TODAY.

1:24:05.937 --> 1:24:08.595
I'M THE ONLIEST MAN WHO
CALLS THE EXACT ROUND

1:24:08.629 --> 1:24:10.390
IN WHICH MY OPPONENT
WILL FALL MONTHS

1:24:10.424 --> 1:24:12.461
BEFORE THE FIGHT.

1:24:12.495 --> 1:24:14.359
HE TRADED
JOKES WITH JOHNNY CARSON

1:24:14.394 --> 1:24:17.604
ON "THE TONIGHT SHOW,"
READ POETRY AT THE BITTER END,

1:24:17.638 --> 1:24:19.778
A COFFEEHOUSE
IN GREENWICH VILLAGE,

1:24:19.813 --> 1:24:22.954
AND HELD COURT IN HIS ROOM
AT THE PLYMOUTH HOTEL,

1:24:22.988 --> 1:24:26.440
BOASTING THAT DOUG JONES POSED
LITTLE THREAT

1:24:26.475 --> 1:24:29.133
AND WOULDN'T KEEP HIM
FROM THE "TOMATO-RED CADILLAC

1:24:29.167 --> 1:24:32.308
ELDORADO CONVERTIBLE
WITH WHITE LEATHER UPHOLSTERY"

1:24:32.343 --> 1:24:34.828
THAT THE LOUISVILLE SPONSORING
GROUP HAD PROMISED HIM

1:24:34.862 --> 1:24:37.900
IN VICTORY.

1:24:37.934 --> 1:24:39.384
FLOYD PATTERSON
WON THE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT

1:24:39.419 --> 1:24:41.662
CHAMPIONSHIP ONE MONTH
BEFORE HE WAS 22

1:24:41.697 --> 1:24:43.906
I JUST HAD A BIRTHDAY
JANUARY THE 17th.

1:24:43.940 --> 1:24:46.460
AFTER I ANNIHILATE
DOUG JONES,

1:24:46.495 --> 1:24:48.945
LISTON WILL BE MY MEAT.

1:24:51.258 --> 1:24:53.640
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
HAD SOLD ITS LAST SEAT

1:24:53.674 --> 1:24:55.849
5 DAYS BEFORE.

1:24:55.883 --> 1:25:00.233
IT WAS THE ARENA'S
FIRST-EVER ADVANCE SELLOUT.

1:25:00.267 --> 1:25:01.682
IT'S STANDING
ROOM ONLY

1:25:01.717 --> 1:25:03.443
AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
IN NEW YORK CITY,

1:25:03.477 --> 1:25:05.583
WHERE ONCE AGAIN,
THE FAMOUS LANDMARK HAS BECOME

1:25:05.617 --> 1:25:07.481
THE MECCA OF BOXING.

1:25:07.516 --> 1:25:09.621
THERE IS ONE YOUNG MAN WHO
HAS MADE THIS ALL POSSIBLE.

1:25:09.656 --> 1:25:12.693
HE IS A 21-YEAR-OLD HEAVYWEIGHT
FROM LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY,

1:25:12.728 --> 1:25:15.489
NAMED CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY.

1:25:16.870 --> 1:25:18.113
CASSIUS CLAY--

1:25:18.147 --> 1:25:19.183
WATCH HIS SPEEDY LEFT HAND.

1:25:19.217 --> 1:25:20.667
HE'S GOT A BEAUTY.

1:25:20.701 --> 1:25:22.462
STYLES MAKE FIGHTS.

1:25:22.496 --> 1:25:23.980
YOU JUST SAW ONE

1:25:24.015 --> 1:25:25.189
OF CLAY'S HABITS,
PULLING AWAY FROM PUNCHES

1:25:25.223 --> 1:25:27.294
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO SLIP THEM.

1:25:27.329 --> 1:25:29.054
DOUG JONES KNEW HOW TO
TAKE ADVANTAGE

1:25:29.089 --> 1:25:32.161
OF CLAY'S LEANING BACK
AND HANDS DROPPED.

1:25:32.196 --> 1:25:34.163
2, 2 1/2,
AND THERE IT IS.

1:25:34.198 --> 1:25:36.890
A GOOD, SOLID PUNCH.

1:25:36.924 --> 1:25:40.204
DOUG JONES PUNCHED
WHILE CASSIUS WAS PUNCHING.

1:25:40.238 --> 1:25:41.998
IF YOU PUNCH WHILE HE'S
PUNCHING, HE'S NOT ABLE TO

1:25:42.033 --> 1:25:45.036
ADJUST TO, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
WHAT'S COMING AT HIM.

1:25:45.070 --> 1:25:48.729
CLAY WAS
DEFINITELY SHAKEN UP BY A SHOT

1:25:48.764 --> 1:25:50.490
THAT CUT HIM
AS HE WAS BACKING AWAY

1:25:50.524 --> 1:25:52.699
FROM A PUNCH INSTEAD
OF TRYING TO SLIP IT.

1:25:52.733 --> 1:25:55.978
WHEN A FIGHTER LIKE
CASSIUS GETS HIT WITH SHOTS

1:25:56.012 --> 1:25:57.876
THAT GETS HIS
ATTENTION, GUESS WHAT.

1:25:57.911 --> 1:26:01.017
HE STARTS FIGHTING WITH
HIS BACK FOOT OUT THE DOOR,

1:26:01.052 --> 1:26:04.193
WITHOUT THE CONFIDENCE
THAT HE USUALLY HAS.

1:26:04.228 --> 1:26:08.680
AS HE'S GOING BACK,
JUST GOT NAILED BY A RIGHT HAND.

1:26:08.715 --> 1:26:11.649
JONES PEPPERED CLAY
WITH PUNCHES,

1:26:11.683 --> 1:26:14.203
WHILE WEATHERING CLAY'S
OWN ASSAULT.

1:26:14.238 --> 1:26:16.757
15 SECONDS TO GO.

1:26:16.792 --> 1:26:20.692
FANS ARE PROBABLY BOOING
ABOUT THE PREDICTION.

1:26:20.727 --> 1:26:23.074
WHEN THE BELL RANG
ENDING THE FOURTH ROUND

1:26:23.108 --> 1:26:26.491
WITH JONES STILL ON HIS FEET,
THE CROWD JEERED CLAY

1:26:26.526 --> 1:26:29.356
FOR FAILING TO FULFILL
HIS PREDICTION.

1:26:29.391 --> 1:26:34.050
CASSIUS CLAY PUNCHED
AWAY TO NO EFFECT.

1:26:34.085 --> 1:26:37.226
IT'S ROUND 5
AT THE GARDEN IN NEW YORK.

1:26:37.261 --> 1:26:39.228
IF CASSIUS CLAY WAS
IN CONTROL,

1:26:39.263 --> 1:26:41.575
HE'S DANCING AROUND THE RING.

1:26:41.610 --> 1:26:45.545
IF YOU WATCH CLAY,
WHEN HE STOPS DANCING,

1:26:45.579 --> 1:26:46.891
HE'S UNCOMFORTABLE,

1:26:46.925 --> 1:26:50.550
AND THAT'S WHEN
HE'S VULNERABLE.

1:26:50.584 --> 1:26:56.245
WE HAVE ONE
MINUTE LEFT IN ROUND 5.

1:26:56.280 --> 1:26:59.041
STYLISTICALLY,
DOUG JONES SOLVED CLAY.

1:27:04.667 --> 1:27:08.084
BEFORE THE SEVENTH
ROUND, ANGELO DUNDEE WARNED CLAY

1:27:08.119 --> 1:27:10.432
THAT HE COULD "KISS
THE CADILLAC GOOD-BYE"

1:27:10.466 --> 1:27:13.124
IF HE DIDN'T GET GOING.

1:27:13.158 --> 1:27:17.922
OVER THE LAST 3 ROUNDS,
CLAY OUT-PUNCHED JONES

1:27:17.956 --> 1:27:19.889
BUT COULD NOT KNOCK HIM OUT.

1:27:19.924 --> 1:27:21.891
5 SECONDS.

1:27:24.135 --> 1:27:28.173
THE JUDGES WOULD
HAVE TO DECIDE.

1:27:28.208 --> 1:27:31.487
I DON'T THINK THAT CLAY
WAS PROJECTING BODY LANGUAGE

1:27:31.522 --> 1:27:33.627
THAT HE WON THE FIGHT.

1:27:33.662 --> 1:27:35.560
HE LOOKED DEJECTED.

1:27:35.595 --> 1:27:37.148
DOUG JONES DOMINATES CLAY.

1:27:37.182 --> 1:27:39.254
HE OUT-PUNCHED HIM,
HE OUT-HUSTLED HIM,

1:27:39.288 --> 1:27:40.910
HE CONTROLLED HIM.

1:27:40.945 --> 1:27:42.567
JUST BECAUSE YOU DO THAT,
IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE

1:27:42.602 --> 1:27:44.293
GOING TO GET THE DECISION

1:27:44.328 --> 1:27:46.675
BECAUSE IT'S BUSINESS.

1:27:46.709 --> 1:27:49.091
WINNER
BY UNANIMOUS DECISION

1:27:49.125 --> 1:27:51.300
CASSIUS CLAY.

1:27:51.335 --> 1:27:52.612
THERE YOU HAVE IT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

1:27:52.646 --> 1:27:54.338
THE CROWD YELLED, "FIX!"

1:27:54.372 --> 1:27:58.480
AND HURLED CIGARS
AND PAPER CUPS INTO THE RING.

1:27:58.514 --> 1:28:02.035
SOME CLAIMED THAT CLAY'S
FAULTS--HE HAD NO BALANCE,

1:28:02.069 --> 1:28:05.590
KEPT HIS HANDS TOO LOW,
HIS PUNCHES LACKED FORCE--

1:28:05.625 --> 1:28:08.041
HAD NEVER BEEN MORE APPARENT.

1:28:08.075 --> 1:28:10.975
"HE HAS THE STUFF
BUT NEEDS A LOT OF SEASONING,"

1:28:11.009 --> 1:28:14.323
FORMER HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION GENE TUNNEY SAID.

1:28:14.358 --> 1:28:16.325
OTHERS WERE SIMPLY
DISAPPOINTED THAT

1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:20.122
THE YOUNG UPSTART HADN'T BEEN
PUT IN HIS PLACE.

1:28:20.156 --> 1:28:21.779
CASSIUS CLAY
IS MIMICKING SOME

1:28:21.813 --> 1:28:24.333
OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
BOOING THE DECISION.

1:28:24.368 --> 1:28:25.645
I LOVE IT.

1:28:25.679 --> 1:28:27.129
YOU
LOVE TO BE BOOED?

1:28:27.163 --> 1:28:29.373
BOO, YELL, SCREAM,
THROW PEANUTS,

1:28:29.407 --> 1:28:32.997
BUT WHATEVER YOU DO,
PAY TO GET IN.

1:28:33.031 --> 1:28:37.795
SONNY LISTON HAD BEEN WATCHING
ON CLOSED-CIRCUIT IN MIAMI.

1:28:37.829 --> 1:28:42.213
"I'LL GET LOCKED UP FOR MURDER
IF I FIGHT HIM," HE SAID.

1:28:42.247 --> 1:28:45.354
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY RESPECT FOR HIM
AT ALL AS A FIGHTER?

1:28:45.389 --> 1:28:47.080
AS A FIGHTER?

1:28:47.114 --> 1:28:48.461
I THINK HE
SHOULD BE LOCKED UP

1:28:48.495 --> 1:28:51.567
FOR IMPERSONATING
A FIGHTER.

1:28:51.602 --> 1:28:55.019
SORE AND EXHAUSTED,
CLAY WAS EAGER TO RELAX

1:28:55.053 --> 1:28:58.160
AND FETCH THE TOMATO-RED
CONVERTIBLE THAT AWAITED HIM

1:28:58.194 --> 1:29:01.336
AT LOUISVILLE'S
STANDARD CADILLAC COMPANY.

1:29:04.200 --> 1:29:06.686
I'M TELLING YOU.
PRETTY, PRETTY.

1:29:06.720 --> 1:29:08.998
A MOVIE STAR.

1:29:09.033 --> 1:29:11.242
THOUGH HE HAD
STRUGGLED AGAINST JONES,

1:29:11.276 --> 1:29:13.382
CLAY HAD MUCH TO CELEBRATE.

1:29:13.417 --> 1:29:15.695
HE WAS NOW 18-0 AND STILL

1:29:15.729 --> 1:29:18.836
THE NUMBER TWO CONTENDER
BEHIND THE EX-CHAMPION

1:29:18.870 --> 1:29:21.286
FLOYD PATTERSON.

1:29:21.321 --> 1:29:24.220
THE MEDIA ATTENTION HE HAD
TIRELESSLY COURTED--

1:29:24.255 --> 1:29:28.397
GOOD OR BAD--NOW CAME
IN TORRENTS.

1:29:28.432 --> 1:29:30.399
I'M THE ONLIEST POET
IN THE FIGHT GAME TODAY,

1:29:30.434 --> 1:29:31.745
THE ONLIEST PROPHET.

1:29:31.780 --> 1:29:33.437
DON'T BE SURPRISED
OF NOTHING I DO.

1:29:33.471 --> 1:29:35.508
I'LL SOON BE IN THE MOVIES.

1:29:35.542 --> 1:29:37.924
I CUT RECORDS,
I SING, I CAN FIGHT,

1:29:37.958 --> 1:29:39.374
I CAN DO ANYTHING.

1:29:39.408 --> 1:29:41.237
THAT'S WHY I SAY
I AM THE GREATEST.

1:29:41.272 --> 1:29:44.448
THAT'S THE NAME OF
THE ALBUM, "I AM THE GREATEST!"

1:29:44.482 --> 1:29:47.209
THIS IS
THE LEGEND OF CASSIUS CLAY,

1:29:47.243 --> 1:29:50.695
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FIGHTER
IN THE WORLD TODAY.

1:29:50.730 --> 1:29:53.629
"I'M THE GREATEST.
I'M THE DOUBLE GREATEST.

1:29:53.664 --> 1:29:56.321
I WILL BE A CLEAN
AND SPARKLING CHAMPION,"

1:29:56.356 --> 1:29:58.427
HE BRAGGED TO TIME MAGAZINE,
WHICH FEATURED HIM

1:29:58.462 --> 1:30:00.153
ON ITS COVER.

1:30:00.187 --> 1:30:02.431
HE TALKS A GREAT
DEAL AND BRAGS INDEEDY

1:30:02.466 --> 1:30:06.090
OF A MUSCULAR PUNCH
THAT'S INCREDIBLY SPEEDY.

1:30:06.124 --> 1:30:08.955
ALEX POINSETT
OF "EBONY" MAGAZINE SAW

1:30:08.989 --> 1:30:13.062
IN CLAY'S BRAVADO
MORE THAN PLAYFUL BOASTING.

1:30:13.097 --> 1:30:15.789
"CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY
IS A BLAST FURNACE

1:30:15.824 --> 1:30:18.896
OF RACE PRIDE,"
HE WROTE, "A PRIDE SCORCHED

1:30:18.930 --> 1:30:22.727
WITH MEMORIES
OF A MILLION LITTLE BURNS."

1:30:22.762 --> 1:30:25.281
FOR I AM THE MAN
THIS POEM IS ABOUT,

1:30:25.316 --> 1:30:28.353
THE NEXT CHAMP OF THE WORLD,
THERE ISN'T A DOUBT.

1:30:28.388 --> 1:30:31.115
THIS I PREDICT,
AND I KNOW THE SCORE.

1:30:31.149 --> 1:30:34.498
I'LL BE CHAMP
OF THE WORLD IN '64.

1:30:34.532 --> 1:30:37.259
IT WAS VERY
DIFFERENT TO USE THAT PLATFORM

1:30:37.293 --> 1:30:39.364
REALLY FOR SELF-AFFIRMATION

1:30:39.399 --> 1:30:41.090
AND PROMOTE HIMSELF
AS A FIGHTER

1:30:41.125 --> 1:30:45.025
AND IN HIS OWN WAY
LIFT UP BLACK PEOPLE.

1:30:45.060 --> 1:30:47.752
"I AM SOMEBODY,
I AM THE GREATEST."

1:30:47.787 --> 1:30:49.444
AND MOST OF ALL, I'M PRETTY.

1:30:49.478 --> 1:30:52.032
MOST FIGHTERS ARE UGLY.

1:30:52.067 --> 1:30:54.828
WHAT MADE CLAY APPEALING
TO MY GENERATION

1:30:54.863 --> 1:30:57.279
WAS THAT HE WAS YOUNG,
HE WAS HUMOROUS,

1:30:57.313 --> 1:31:00.178
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS
VERY UNUSUAL

1:31:00.213 --> 1:31:01.870
FOR A BLACK PUBLIC FIGURE,
PARTICULARLY HUMOROUS

1:31:01.904 --> 1:31:03.492
IN THE WAY THAT HE WAS.

1:31:03.527 --> 1:31:05.874
HE WASN'T SOME KIND OF
STEPIN FETCHIT CLOWN

1:31:05.908 --> 1:31:07.841
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

1:31:07.876 --> 1:31:12.708
CLAY REPRESENTED SOMETHING
FOR THE GENERATION I GREW UP IN

1:31:12.743 --> 1:31:15.504
THAT WAS DIFFERENT
FROM MY UNCLE'S GENERATION.

1:31:15.539 --> 1:31:17.126
THEY WERE WORLD WAR II,

1:31:17.161 --> 1:31:18.818
THEY WERE
THE GREATEST GENERATION,

1:31:18.852 --> 1:31:21.717
THEIR HEROES WERE
JACKIE ROBINSON, JESSE OWENS,

1:31:21.752 --> 1:31:23.547
AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT,

1:31:23.581 --> 1:31:26.239
AND CLAY CAME ALONG,
AND HE WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

1:31:26.273 --> 1:31:27.896
HE WAS FROM MY GENERATION.

1:31:27.930 --> 1:31:29.345
WELL LET ME FINISH,
LET ME TALK!

1:31:29.380 --> 1:31:30.554
THIS BOY'S MODEST.
I'M THE GREATEST.

1:31:30.588 --> 1:31:32.141
HE'S NOT A TALKER.

1:31:32.176 --> 1:31:33.349
I'M GOING TO FIGHT
SONNY LISTON RIGHT AFTER

1:31:33.384 --> 1:31:35.075
I ANNIHILATE HENRY COOPER,

1:31:35.110 --> 1:31:37.146
AND AS SOON AS I ANNIHILATE
HENRY COOPER, I WANT

1:31:37.181 --> 1:31:40.909
THAT BIG, UGLY BEAR RIGHT IN,
UH--RIGHT HERE ON MIAMI BEACH.

1:31:40.943 --> 1:31:43.256
WITH LISTON AND
PATTERSON SLATED FOR A REMATCH

1:31:43.290 --> 1:31:46.501
THAT SUMMER, CLAY SIGNED
TO FIGHT ENGLAND'S

1:31:46.535 --> 1:31:48.675
HENRY COOPER.

1:31:48.710 --> 1:31:50.435
WELL, THERE'S A GUY
IN ENGLAND NAMED HENRY COOPER.

1:31:50.470 --> 1:31:52.852
TODAY, HE'S NAMED
SIR HENRY COOPER,

1:31:52.886 --> 1:31:55.855
AND WHAT HE WENT THROUGH
WITH HIS HIGH CHEEK BONES

1:31:55.889 --> 1:31:58.513
AND BLEEDING,
HE SHOULD BE A SIR.

1:31:58.547 --> 1:32:00.998
TREMENDOUS LEFT HOOK
THAT NOBODY APPRECIATED

1:32:01.032 --> 1:32:02.827
EXCEPT THE BRITISH.

1:32:02.862 --> 1:32:05.174
WELL,
HENRY COOPER'S NOT GOING
TO 5 ROUNDS WITH ME.

1:32:05.209 --> 1:32:06.831
HE'S NOT GOING
5 ROUNDS WITH YOU?

1:32:06.866 --> 1:32:08.453
IF HE GOES OVER 5,
I WON'T RETURN

1:32:08.488 --> 1:32:10.007
TO MY COUNTRY
FOR 90 DAYS.
FOR 90 DAYS.

1:32:10.041 --> 1:32:12.354
AND IF HE BEATS ME,
I'LL RETIRE.

1:32:12.388 --> 1:32:14.114
ARRIVING
IN LONDON, CLAY HAD

1:32:14.149 --> 1:32:16.669
THE OUTFITTERS TO THE DUKE
OF EDINBURGH TAILOR HIM

1:32:16.703 --> 1:32:20.293
A RED BROCADE COCKTAIL JACKET
WITH A DRAGON MOTIF

1:32:20.327 --> 1:32:23.572
AND BOWLER HAT
AND HIRED A ROLLS-ROYCE

1:32:23.607 --> 1:32:25.229
TO TAKE HIM TO PROMOTIONS.

1:32:27.611 --> 1:32:30.786
HE CALLED COOPER
A TRAMP AND A CRIPPLE,

1:32:30.821 --> 1:32:33.306
BRAGGED THAT HE HADN'T
EVEN BOTHERED TO TRAIN

1:32:33.340 --> 1:32:36.930
AND WOULD STILL WIN
IN 5 ROUNDS.

1:32:36.965 --> 1:32:39.450
THE BRITISH WERE NOT AMUSED.

1:32:44.420 --> 1:32:46.043
AND I IMAGINE
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE

1:32:46.077 --> 1:32:47.562
SITTING AROUND THE RINGSIDE HERE
IN THE OPEN AIR

1:32:47.596 --> 1:32:49.460
AT WEMBLEY TONIGHT
WHO MAY WELL THINK

1:32:49.494 --> 1:32:52.774
THAT BY COMING INTO THE RING
WITH THAT RIDICULOUS CROWN

1:32:52.808 --> 1:32:54.499
ON HIS HEAD MR. CLAY
IS DOING HIS BEST

1:32:54.534 --> 1:32:56.329
TO CHEAPEN
THE PROFESSIONAL FIGHT GAME,

1:32:56.363 --> 1:32:59.021
AND I MUST SAY I'M INCLINED TO
SHARE THOSE VIEWS MYSELF.

1:33:01.334 --> 1:33:04.648
LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,

1:33:04.682 --> 1:33:07.064
THE MAIN EVENT.

1:33:07.098 --> 1:33:10.757
PRESENTING, FROM BELLINGHAM,

1:33:10.792 --> 1:33:12.483
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION

1:33:12.517 --> 1:33:13.622
OF GREAT BRITAIN

1:33:13.657 --> 1:33:15.659
AND THE BRITISH EMPIRE,

1:33:15.693 --> 1:33:17.661
HENRY COOPER!

1:33:21.768 --> 1:33:27.843
FROM LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY,
CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY.

1:33:34.298 --> 1:33:36.196
THE CROWD ROARED
WHEN COOPER BLOODIED

1:33:36.231 --> 1:33:38.233
CLAY'S NOSE IN THE FIRST.

1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:42.686
IN THE SECOND, CLAY OPENED
A SMALL CUT ABOVE

1:33:42.720 --> 1:33:46.551
COOPER'S LEFT EYE, WHICH
BY ROUND 3 HAD BROKEN OPEN,

1:33:46.586 --> 1:33:50.383
SENDING BLOOD FLOWING
OVER COOPER'S FACE.

1:33:52.005 --> 1:33:53.938
NOW CLAY
IS JUST JABBING CASUALLY

1:33:53.973 --> 1:33:55.526
WITH HIS LEFT HAND.

1:33:55.560 --> 1:33:57.493
BUT INSTEAD OF
FINISHING HIM OFF,

1:33:57.528 --> 1:34:01.014
CLAY SEEMED TO BE DELIBERATELY
PROLONGING THE FIGHT.

1:34:07.676 --> 1:34:09.782
THE BELL HAS SOUNDED,

1:34:09.816 --> 1:34:13.475
AND HE'S UP
AT ABOUT 3--CLAY.

1:34:13.509 --> 1:34:15.373
THAT WAS THE END
OF THE FOURTH ROUND,

1:34:15.408 --> 1:34:18.653
AND HE HIT HIM ABOUT TWO SECONDS
BEFORE THE END OF THE ROUND.

1:34:18.687 --> 1:34:21.552
HOPING TO REVIVE CLAY,
HIS CORNER MEN BROKE VIALS

1:34:21.586 --> 1:34:24.210
OF SMELLING SALTS
UNDER HIS NOSE

1:34:24.244 --> 1:34:26.695
AND DROPPED ICE CUBES
INTO HIS TRUNKS.

1:34:26.730 --> 1:34:28.317
THEY'RE WORKING
FURIOUSLY ON HIM

1:34:28.352 --> 1:34:30.906
IN THE CORNER,
ANGELO DUNDEE HIS TRAINER.

1:34:30.941 --> 1:34:34.047
IT WORKED.

1:34:34.082 --> 1:34:36.705
WHEN THE BELL SIGNALED
THE START OF ROUND 5,

1:34:36.740 --> 1:34:38.914
CLAY CAME OUT AGGRESSIVELY.

1:34:38.949 --> 1:34:40.571
AND NOW
ROUND 5 IS THE ROUND

1:34:40.605 --> 1:34:43.712
IN WHICH CLAY SAID
HE WOULD BEAT COOPER.

1:34:43.747 --> 1:34:47.060
AND NOW COOPER'S LEFT EYE IS
REALLY IN A SHOCKING STATE.

1:34:47.095 --> 1:34:48.752
IT REALLY IS NOW.

1:34:48.786 --> 1:34:50.719
AND I THINK TOMMY LITTLE
WILL HAVE TO STOP THIS

1:34:50.754 --> 1:34:53.170
BECAUSE COOPER'S EYE IS REALLY

1:34:53.204 --> 1:34:55.551
IN AN ABSOLUTELY
APPALLING STATE.

1:34:55.586 --> 1:34:57.450
AND NOW HE'S STEPPING IN,
AND I THINK THIS IS IT!

1:34:57.484 --> 1:35:00.211
THE TOWEL HAS COME IN
FROM COOPER'S CORNER,

1:35:00.246 --> 1:35:03.421
AND TOMMY LITTLE'S
LOOKING AT IT,

1:35:03.456 --> 1:35:04.629
AND HE'S HAD TO STOP THE FIGHT.

1:35:04.664 --> 1:35:06.114
CLAY HAD PREVAILED,

1:35:06.148 --> 1:35:08.772
AND HE DID IT
IN THE FIFTH ROUND.

1:35:08.806 --> 1:35:10.946
CLAY IS GETTING
BOMBARDED WITH PROGRAMS

1:35:10.981 --> 1:35:12.741
FROM ANGRY RINGSIDERS.

1:35:12.776 --> 1:35:13.742
I'M ALWAYS BOOED,
EVERYWHERE I GO I'M BOOED.

1:35:13.777 --> 1:35:14.916
I LIKE TO BE BOOED.

1:35:14.950 --> 1:35:16.400
THAT'S WHY I FIGHT HARD.

1:35:16.434 --> 1:35:17.573
AND YOU CAME
IN THE RING

1:35:17.608 --> 1:35:18.782
WITH A CROWN
ON YOUR HEAD.

1:35:18.816 --> 1:35:19.921
IS THAT UH...

1:35:19.955 --> 1:35:21.646
BECAUSE I AM THE KING.

1:35:21.681 --> 1:35:23.131
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE
A QUEEN OF ENGLAND,

1:35:23.165 --> 1:35:24.408
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A KING.

1:35:24.442 --> 1:35:26.721
BUT WHAT'S
SONNY LISTON, CASSIUS?

1:35:26.755 --> 1:35:28.757
SONNY LISTON,
THAT BIG, UGLY BEAR?

1:35:28.792 --> 1:35:31.104
UH, HE WILL FALL
IN 8 ROUNDS.

1:35:31.139 --> 1:35:35.143
LISTON WILL FALL IN 8
TO PROVE THAT I AM GREAT.

1:35:35.177 --> 1:35:37.041
WAITING FOR CLAY
IN HIS DRESSING ROOM

1:35:37.076 --> 1:35:40.113
WAS SONNY LISTON'S MANAGER
JACK NILON.

1:35:40.148 --> 1:35:42.875
"WE WANT YOU BAD," HE TOLD
CLAY AND PROMISED HIM

1:35:42.909 --> 1:35:46.775
A FIGHT AFTER LISTON'S
REMATCH WITH PATTERSON.

1:35:52.194 --> 1:35:53.575
SONNY, WELL,
YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD,

1:35:53.609 --> 1:35:55.819
I KNOW TO YOUR FIGHT
AGAINST PATTERSON.

1:35:55.853 --> 1:35:58.097
DO YOU EXPECT
THAT FIGHT TO GO
MUCH DIFFERENTLY

1:35:58.131 --> 1:35:59.892
THAN IT DID
LAST TIME AROUND?

1:35:59.926 --> 1:36:02.584
I DON'T THINK SO.

1:36:02.618 --> 1:36:04.344
WHAT HAPPENS
AFTER PATTERSON?

1:36:04.379 --> 1:36:06.139
CASSIUS IN THE LINE?

1:36:06.174 --> 1:36:08.832
YEAH,
HE'S RIGHT UP FRONT.

1:36:08.866 --> 1:36:11.282
WHAT ABOUT CASSIUS?

1:36:11.317 --> 1:36:14.907
WELL, I IMAGINE THAT
IF HE WOULD COME TO ME,

1:36:14.941 --> 1:36:16.494
I'D KILL HIM,
AND IF HE RUNS,

1:36:16.529 --> 1:36:18.117
I'M GONNA CATCH HIM
AND KILL HIM.

1:36:18.151 --> 1:36:19.981
B.B.

1:36:20.015 --> 1:36:22.328
IN LAS VEGAS,
AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN IS DUE,

1:36:22.362 --> 1:36:26.608
BUT ALMOST NO ONE ANTICIPATES
AN ECLIPSE OF SONNY.

1:36:26.642 --> 1:36:28.437
LISTON IS 5-1 ON.

1:36:33.891 --> 1:36:36.825
LISTON KNOCKED
PATTERSON DOWN 3 TIMES

1:36:36.860 --> 1:36:40.380
IN A FIGHT THAT LASTED
2 MINUTES AND 10 SECONDS,

1:36:40.415 --> 1:36:46.524
JUST 4 SECONDS LONGER
THAN THEIR FIRST BOUT.

1:36:46.559 --> 1:36:49.665
CASSIUS CLAY, IN TOWN FOR
THE FIGHT, HAD NOT MISSED

1:36:49.700 --> 1:36:52.634
HIS CHANCE TO NEEDLE THE CHAMP.

1:36:52.668 --> 1:36:54.498
SONNY LISTON WAS
A SERIOUS GAMBLER.

1:36:54.532 --> 1:36:57.466
CLAY IS FOLLOWING HIM
THROUGH THE CASINO.

1:36:57.501 --> 1:36:59.675
"LOOK AT THE BIG, UGLY
BEAR," SAID CLAY.

1:36:59.710 --> 1:37:01.712
"HE CAN'T EVEN
SHOOT CRAPS."

1:37:01.746 --> 1:37:06.165
FURIOUS, LISTON THREATENED
TO RIP CLAY'S TONGUE OUT.

1:37:06.199 --> 1:37:08.857
AT THAT MOMENT, LISTON
DISLIKED HIM INTENSELY,

1:37:08.892 --> 1:37:11.515
AND CLAY KNEW THAT
HE COULD GET TO LISTON.

1:37:20.351 --> 1:37:22.077
MARTIN LUTHER KING
TEACHES NEGROES

1:37:22.112 --> 1:37:24.183
TO LOVE ALL WHITE PEOPLE
NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO TO YOU,

1:37:24.217 --> 1:37:26.219
AND THE SAME WHITES WHO HE
TEACHES NEGROES TO LOVE

1:37:26.254 --> 1:37:29.050
SIC DOGS ON HIM,
SIC DOGS ON THEIR CHILDREN,

1:37:29.084 --> 1:37:32.156
DOGS ON THEIR WOMEN,
AND DOGS ON THEIR BABIES.

1:37:32.191 --> 1:37:34.262
SO I THINK IT'S
VERY HYPOCRITICAL ON THE PART

1:37:34.296 --> 1:37:36.885
OF WHITES WHO ACCUSE
MR. MUHAMMAD OF A HATE TEACHER

1:37:36.920 --> 1:37:39.163
BECAUSE HE SAYS SEPARATION,
AND THEN SIC DOGS

1:37:39.198 --> 1:37:41.890
ON MARTIN LUTHER KING,
WHO IS TEACHING INTEGRATION.

1:37:41.925 --> 1:37:44.099
IT MEANS THAT NO MATTER
WHAT THE NEGRO DOES,

1:37:44.134 --> 1:37:46.101
HE IS NOT GOING TO GET ALONG
WITH WHITES,

1:37:46.136 --> 1:37:48.448
SO I THINK THAT MR. MUHAMMAD'S
WHOLE PHILOSOPHY IS MORE

1:37:48.483 --> 1:37:52.452
INTELLIGENT THAN MR. KING'S.

1:37:52.487 --> 1:37:54.903
SINCE RETURNING
FROM FIGHTING HENRY COOPER

1:37:54.938 --> 1:37:57.388
IN LONDON, CLAY HAD BEEN
SLIPPING OFF TO NEW YORK

1:37:57.423 --> 1:38:00.460
WHENEVER HE COULD,
VISITING TEMPLE NO. 7

1:38:00.495 --> 1:38:03.947
AND SPENDING TIME
WITH MALCOLM X.

1:38:03.981 --> 1:38:05.949
CLAY FACED MORE
AND MORE QUESTIONS

1:38:05.983 --> 1:38:09.021
FROM SPORTSWRITERS DETERMINED
TO FIND OUT IF HE'D OFFICIALLY

1:38:09.055 --> 1:38:12.610
JOINED THE NATION OF ISLAM.

1:38:12.645 --> 1:38:15.751
THAT SUMMER IN CHICAGO,
A REPORTER HAD TAILED CLAY'S

1:38:15.786 --> 1:38:18.927
CADILLAC OUT OF THE ALLEY
BEHIND A MUSLIM SCHOOL

1:38:18.962 --> 1:38:20.929
ON THE SOUTH SIDE.

1:38:20.964 --> 1:38:23.380
"ARE YOU A BLACK
MUSLIM?" HE YELLED.

1:38:23.414 --> 1:38:25.830
"NO," SAID CASSIUS AT FIRST.

1:38:25.865 --> 1:38:29.904
THEN, AFTER A PAUSE,
HE ADDED, "I DON'T KNOW.

1:38:29.938 --> 1:38:32.941
I'M FOR THE BLACK MUSLIMS."

1:38:32.976 --> 1:38:36.220
CLAY'S SPONSORS GREW WORRIED,
AND HE BEGAN TO

1:38:36.255 --> 1:38:38.291
QUESTION HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH THEM,

1:38:38.326 --> 1:38:41.225
SUGGESTING THAT HE BE PAID MORE.

1:38:41.260 --> 1:38:45.126
"I AM MY OWN MASTER,"
HE SAID, ECHOING MALCOLM X.

1:38:45.160 --> 1:38:49.578
"THERE IS NOBODY TELLING
ME WHAT TO DO."

1:38:49.613 --> 1:38:52.443
CONCERNED THAT CLAY WAS
TOO INEXPERIENCED TO BEAT

1:38:52.478 --> 1:38:55.688
THE OVERPOWERING SONNY LISTON,
THE LOUISVILLE GROUP

1:38:55.722 --> 1:38:58.587
NEVERTHELESS FORGED AHEAD
TO SECURE THE FIGHT

1:38:58.622 --> 1:39:03.075
THEY FEARED MIGHT BE HIS LAST.

1:39:03.109 --> 1:39:05.456
I WILL BE FIGHTING
SONNY LISTON AS SOON

1:39:05.491 --> 1:39:07.527
AS THEY GET MY MONEY RIGHT.

1:39:07.562 --> 1:39:10.289
NOT ONLY UNTIL THEN,
AND, UH--BECAUSE THIS WILL BE

1:39:10.323 --> 1:39:12.084
THE BIGGEST GATE IN ALL HISTORY,

1:39:12.118 --> 1:39:14.949
AND I EXPECT TO BE HALF RICH
AFTER THE FIGHT.

1:39:14.983 --> 1:39:17.192
LISTON'S MANAGERS,
EAGER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

1:39:17.227 --> 1:39:21.162
OF CLAY'S CELEBRITY, AGREED
TO A DEAL THAT WOULD GROSS CLAY

1:39:21.196 --> 1:39:24.820
NEARLY $1 MILLION,
THE LARGEST PAYDAY EVER

1:39:24.855 --> 1:39:26.891
FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT CHALLENGER.

1:39:28.928 --> 1:39:32.483
IN EARLY NOVEMBER,
CLAY LEFT CHICAGO IN AN OLD BUS

1:39:32.518 --> 1:39:34.485
HE'D BOUGHT AND HEADED
FOR DENVER,

1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:37.178
WHERE CLAY AND LISTON PLANNED TO
HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE

1:39:37.212 --> 1:39:40.215
TO ANNOUNCE THEIR FIGHT.

1:39:40.250 --> 1:39:43.460
00 IN THE MORNING,
CASSIUS CLAY STEERED HIS BUS

1:39:43.494 --> 1:39:48.154
INTO LISTON'S NEIGHBORHOOD
AND LEANED ON THE HORN.

1:39:48.189 --> 1:39:50.053
I WOKE HIM UP,
AND HE CAME OUT

1:39:50.087 --> 1:39:52.020
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
IN HIS UNDERCLOTHES, HIS ROBE,

1:39:52.055 --> 1:39:53.539
AND HE HAD A BIG STICK.

1:39:53.573 --> 1:39:55.541
AND I SAID
"YOU BIG, UGLY BEAR, YOU.

1:39:55.575 --> 1:39:58.061
I'M GONNA SEE YOU TOMORROW
FOR THE SIGNING,

1:39:58.095 --> 1:40:00.339
"AND I'M GONNA
KNOCK YOU OUT IN 8,

1:40:00.373 --> 1:40:03.721
AND IF YOU WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN,
I'LL GET YOU IN 7."

1:40:03.756 --> 1:40:06.379
AND HE GOT MAD AND WE
ARGUED FOR ABOUT AN HOUR,

1:40:06.414 --> 1:40:08.588
AND THEN THE POLICEMEN CAME
WITH DOGS.

1:40:10.073 --> 1:40:11.729
THE SCENE THAT
WE HAD THAT NIGHT,

1:40:11.764 --> 1:40:13.386
IT WOULD HAVE MADE YOU THINK
MARTIN LUTHER KING

1:40:13.421 --> 1:40:16.700
WAS DEMONSTRATING.

1:40:21.808 --> 1:40:24.052
LATER THAT DAY,
CLAY AND LISTON WENT

1:40:24.087 --> 1:40:26.020
BEFORE THE PRESS.

1:40:26.054 --> 1:40:29.161
"I'M READY TO GO
TO WAR," CLAY SAID.

1:40:29.195 --> 1:40:31.715
LET'S GET IT ON!
WANT TO GO NOW?

1:40:32.992 --> 1:40:34.580
I'LL WHOOP YOU NOW.

1:40:34.614 --> 1:40:36.340
IT'S GOING TO TAKE
A GOOD MAN TO WHOOP ME.

1:40:36.375 --> 1:40:37.893
YOU CAN LOOK AT ME.
I'M LOADED WITH CONFIDENCE.

1:40:37.928 --> 1:40:39.585
I CAN'T BE BEAT.

1:40:39.619 --> 1:40:41.587
I HAD 180 AMATEUR FIGHTS,
22 PROFESSIONAL FIGHTS,

1:40:41.621 --> 1:40:43.968
AND I'M PRETTY AS A GIRL.

1:40:47.110 --> 1:40:48.732
THE FIGHT
WAS SCHEDULED

1:40:48.766 --> 1:40:52.701
FOR FEBRUARY AFTER HIS
22nd BIRTHDAY.

1:40:52.736 --> 1:40:56.119
THOUGH HE NOW COULD NO LONGER BE
THE YOUNGEST CHAMP EVER,

1:40:56.153 --> 1:41:00.088
HE WOULD FINALLY GET HIS SHOT
AT THE TITLE.

1:41:00.123 --> 1:41:01.434
HERE IS
THE EIGHTH ROUND EXACTLY

1:41:01.469 --> 1:41:03.057
AS IT WILL HAPPEN.

1:41:03.091 --> 1:41:04.368
CLAY COMES OUT TO MEET LISTON,

1:41:04.403 --> 1:41:06.232
AND LISTON STARTS TO RETREAT.

1:41:06.267 --> 1:41:07.820
IF LISTON GOES BACK
AN INCH FARTHER,

1:41:07.854 --> 1:41:09.994
HE'LL END UP IN A RINGSIDE SEAT.

1:41:10.029 --> 1:41:12.618
CLAY SWINGS WITH A LEFT.
CLAY SWINGS WITH A RIGHT.

1:41:12.652 --> 1:41:14.447
LOOK AT YOUNG CASSIUS
CARRY THE FIGHT.

1:41:14.482 --> 1:41:15.828
NOW CLAY LANDS WITH A RIGHT.

1:41:15.862 --> 1:41:17.657
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SWING,

1:41:17.692 --> 1:41:20.143
AND THE PUNCH RAISES
THE BEAR CLEAR OUT OF THE RING.

1:41:21.523 --> 1:41:23.077
LISTON IS STILL RISING,

1:41:23.111 --> 1:41:24.492
AND THE REF WEARS A FROWN,

1:41:24.526 --> 1:41:26.287
FOR HE CAN'T START COUNTING,

1:41:26.321 --> 1:41:28.496
TILL SONNY COMES DOWN.

1:41:28.530 --> 1:41:30.981
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WHEN
THEY CAME TO THE FIGHT

1:41:31.015 --> 1:41:32.500
THAT THEY'D WITNESS
THE LAUNCHING

1:41:32.534 --> 1:41:34.295
OF A HUMAN SATELLITE?

1:41:35.848 --> 1:41:39.955
I AM THE GREATEST!

1:41:39.990 --> 1:41:44.098
ALMOST NOBODY
GAVE CLAY A CHANCE.

1:41:44.132 --> 1:41:46.583
WE ALL THOUGHT HE WAS
TALKING SO MUCH

1:41:46.617 --> 1:41:48.861
THAT HE WAS SCARED TO DEATH.

1:41:48.895 --> 1:41:51.139
THAT'S WHY EVERYBODY
SAID, "SHUT UP, CLAY.

1:41:51.174 --> 1:41:52.761
"YOU'RE JUST SCARED.

1:41:52.796 --> 1:41:55.937
YOU'RE JUST SCARED
TO FIGHT THIS MAN."

1:41:55.971 --> 1:41:58.664
SONNY LISTON WAS SO FORMIDABLE.

1:41:58.698 --> 1:42:00.769
HE JUST DESTROYED PEOPLE.

1:42:00.804 --> 1:42:03.703
IT WAS LIKE
A BICYCLE AGAINST A TANK.

1:42:05.567 --> 1:42:08.294
IF ANYBODY TELLS YOU THAT
THEY THOUGHT CLAY

1:42:08.329 --> 1:42:10.607
WAS GONNA BEAT LISTON,
THEY LYING.

1:42:10.641 --> 1:42:12.333
THEY ARE LYING.

1:42:12.367 --> 1:42:15.267
WHO'D THIS GUY
EVER FIGHT?
WHO, CLAY?

1:42:15.301 --> 1:42:16.613
YEAH.
HE BOXED LONDON.

1:42:16.647 --> 1:42:17.890
LONDON. BOXED WHO?

1:42:17.924 --> 1:42:19.340
PETER COOPER--
I MEAN HENRY COOPER.

1:42:19.374 --> 1:42:21.273
YOU COULD LICK
PETER COOPER.

1:42:21.307 --> 1:42:22.619
HE'LL FREEZE UP WHEN
HE GETS IN THE RING.

1:42:22.653 --> 1:42:23.896
I'LL GUARANTEE THAT.

1:42:23.930 --> 1:42:25.173
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

1:42:25.208 --> 1:42:27.555
LISTON IS
TOO POWERFUL.

1:42:27.589 --> 1:42:29.695
HE'LL KNOCK HIM OUT
IN THE SECOND ROUND.

1:42:29.729 --> 1:42:31.352
OH, YEAH, I ALWAYS
PRAY FOR HIM.

1:42:31.386 --> 1:42:34.286
I PRAYED FOR HIM DURING
THE--WHAT DO YOU CALL IT--

1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:36.080
THE FIGHT OVER
IN ENGLAND, COOPER,

1:42:36.115 --> 1:42:37.496
HENRY COOPER FIGHT.

1:42:37.530 --> 1:42:40.326
WHEN HE KNOCKED HIM
DOWN, I WAS PRAYING.

1:42:40.361 --> 1:42:42.190
IF CASSIUS CLAY
WAS CONCERNED,

1:42:42.225 --> 1:42:44.019
HE DIDN'T LET ON.

1:42:44.054 --> 1:42:47.057
SONNY LISTON MAY HAVE
MORE POWER, CLAY CONCEDED,

1:42:47.091 --> 1:42:49.991
BUT HE BELIEVED THAT
THE GREAT ONES--LIKE JOE LOUIS

1:42:50.025 --> 1:42:53.581
AND SUGAR RAY ROBINSON--
RELIED ON FOOTWORK, RHYTHM,

1:42:53.615 --> 1:42:56.687
AND TIMING, NOT STRENGTH ALONE.

1:43:03.798 --> 1:43:05.040
LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,

1:43:05.075 --> 1:43:07.422
THIS IS
CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY.

1:43:07.457 --> 1:43:09.113
HE'S YOUNG,
HE'S HANDSOME.

1:43:09.148 --> 1:43:10.839
THEY KNOW IT.

1:43:10.874 --> 1:43:13.532
DANCE FOR THE CROWD.
DANCE, BOY.

1:43:13.566 --> 1:43:15.119
AHH! THE WORLD
IS WATCHING YOU.

1:43:15.154 --> 1:43:16.431
AHH!

1:43:16.466 --> 1:43:17.915
I'M THE CHAMP.

1:43:17.950 --> 1:43:19.710
I'M THE BIGGEST THING
IN HISTORY.

1:43:19.745 --> 1:43:21.229
I'M THE KING!

1:43:21.264 --> 1:43:22.851
QUEEN--
THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND--

1:43:22.886 --> 1:43:24.198
THE BEATLES
WANT MY AUTOGRAPH.

1:43:24.232 --> 1:43:25.509
YES, THEY DO.I'M, THE KING.

1:43:25.544 --> 1:43:27.511
KING OF THE RING! AHH!

1:43:27.546 --> 1:43:30.100
AS THE FIGHT
APPROACHED, CLAY AND DUNDEE

1:43:30.134 --> 1:43:33.414
WATCHED FILMS OF LISTON'S
RECENT FIGHTS, SEARCHING

1:43:33.448 --> 1:43:36.624
FOR WAYS TO ELUDE
HIS PISTON-LIKE JAB,

1:43:36.658 --> 1:43:39.523
AND FILMS OF SUGAR RAY ROBINSON,
WHO HAD WORN DOWN

1:43:39.558 --> 1:43:44.390
MORE POWERFUL OPPONENTS
WITH HIS NONSTOP MOTION.

1:43:44.425 --> 1:43:47.290
CLAY ALSO HELD
BRUTAL SPARRING SESSIONS,

1:43:47.324 --> 1:43:49.257
PREPARING
AS THOUGH THE FIGHT WOULD GO

1:43:49.292 --> 1:43:51.915
ALL 15 ROUNDS.

1:43:51.949 --> 1:43:55.090
HE WAS CERTAIN HE COULD
OUTLAST LISTON,

1:43:55.125 --> 1:43:58.887
WHOSE FIGHTS HAD RARELY LASTED
MORE THAN A FEW ROUNDS.

1:43:58.922 --> 1:44:00.372
I'M TOO FAST.CHAMPION
FROM THE CRIB.

1:44:00.406 --> 1:44:02.166
I'M THE KING.KING OF THE RING.

1:44:02.201 --> 1:44:03.720
BORN THE CHAMP.BORN A CHAMP
FROM THE CRIB.

1:44:03.754 --> 1:44:05.239
AHH!

1:44:05.273 --> 1:44:06.723
DREW "BUNDINI" BROWN,
A ONE-TIME MEMBER

1:44:06.757 --> 1:44:09.622
OF SUGAR RAY ROBINSON'S
ENTOURAGE,

1:44:09.657 --> 1:44:11.728
WAS NOW AT CLAY'S SIDE.

1:44:11.762 --> 1:44:13.316
YOU KNOW HOW GREAT I AM.

1:44:13.350 --> 1:44:14.627
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL
YOU ABOUT MY STRATEGY.

1:44:14.662 --> 1:44:16.180
I'LL LET MY TRAINER
TELL YOU.

1:44:16.215 --> 1:44:17.492
BUNDINI, COME HERE.
BUNDINI, TELL HIM.

1:44:17.527 --> 1:44:18.804
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

1:44:18.838 --> 1:44:20.288
YOU'RE GONNA FLOAT
LIKE A BUTTERFLY

1:44:20.323 --> 1:44:21.462
AND STING LIKE A BEE.

1:44:21.496 --> 1:44:22.670
AHH!

1:44:22.704 --> 1:44:24.396
RUMBLE YOUNG MAN,
RUMBLE.

1:44:24.430 --> 1:44:26.260
AHH!

1:44:26.294 --> 1:44:28.848
WHEN LISTON
ARRIVED AT THE MIAMI AIRPORT,

1:44:28.883 --> 1:44:30.919
CLAY WAS THERE TO GREET HIM.

1:44:30.954 --> 1:44:32.645
WELL, JUST TO SHOW HIM
HOW BOLD I AM,

1:44:32.680 --> 1:44:34.854
I'M READY TO GO TO WAR
IF NECESSARY.

1:44:34.889 --> 1:44:36.615
I'M NOT JIVING.

1:44:36.649 --> 1:44:38.133
YOU THINK THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA, CASSIUS?

1:44:38.168 --> 1:44:39.583
IT DON'T MAKE
ME NO DIFFERENCE.

1:44:39.618 --> 1:44:40.929
I MEAN, I'M READY NOW.

1:44:40.964 --> 1:44:42.276
I'M TIRED OF WAITING
FOR THIS FIGHT.

1:44:42.310 --> 1:44:43.622
I'M NERVOUS.
HE'S GOT MY JOB.

1:44:43.656 --> 1:44:45.796
I'M THE CHAMP.

1:44:45.831 --> 1:44:47.764
AN UNHEARD-OF
THING HAPPENED

1:44:47.798 --> 1:44:49.593
AT THE MAIN STREET GYM
IN MIAMI.

1:44:49.628 --> 1:44:52.941
CHALLENGER CASSIUS INVADED
WHILE LISTON WAS TRAINING.

1:44:52.976 --> 1:44:54.529
IF YOU'D LIKE TO LOSE
YOUR MONEY,

1:44:54.564 --> 1:44:56.290
THEN BE A FOOL
AND BET ON SONNY,

1:44:56.324 --> 1:44:57.532
BUT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE
A GOOD DAY,

1:44:57.567 --> 1:44:59.672
THEN PUT IT ON CLAY.

1:44:59.707 --> 1:45:01.295
I ASKED HIM.

1:45:01.329 --> 1:45:02.675
I SAID, "ALI, ARE YOU
SCARED OF LISTON?"

1:45:02.710 --> 1:45:04.677
"NAW, MAN.
I'MMA CHOP HIM DOWN."

1:45:04.712 --> 1:45:06.645
HE HAD THAT KIND OF ATTITUDE.

1:45:06.679 --> 1:45:09.130
HE SAID, "LISTON'S
GOING IN THE EIGHTH."

1:45:09.164 --> 1:45:10.787
"WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1:45:10.821 --> 1:45:12.823
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION,
GOING IN THE EIGHTH?"

1:45:12.858 --> 1:45:14.446
JABBING
AND LEFT HOOKING,

1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:17.828
JABBING AND LEFT HOOKING.

1:45:17.863 --> 1:45:19.554
YEAH, I'M A PRETTY FIGHTER...

1:45:19.589 --> 1:45:23.351
WHEN YOU KNOW WHO
YOU ARE, IT REMOVES FEAR,

1:45:23.386 --> 1:45:25.629
AND WHEN YOU BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE SERVING GOD,

1:45:25.664 --> 1:45:28.011
THE TRUE AND THE LIVING GOD,
ONCE YOU BELIEVE THAT,

1:45:28.045 --> 1:45:29.668
YOU DON'T FEAR NOTHING.

1:45:29.702 --> 1:45:34.017
SEE, AND THAT'S
THE WAY HE BECAME.

1:45:34.051 --> 1:45:36.537
WHEN HE WASN'T
TRAINING FOR SONNY LISTON,

1:45:36.571 --> 1:45:39.643
CLAY SPENT WHATEVER TIME
HE COULD WITH MALCOLM X,

1:45:39.678 --> 1:45:42.646
WHO HAD BROUGHT HIS FAMILY
TO MIAMI AT CLAY'S EXPENSE

1:45:42.681 --> 1:45:45.269
FOR A RARE VACATION.

1:45:45.304 --> 1:45:48.721
MEANWHILE, ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
SAW NO REASON TO IDENTIFY

1:45:48.756 --> 1:45:51.206
HIS MOVEMENT WITH CASSIUS CLAY.

1:45:51.241 --> 1:45:53.864
BOXING WAS A "VERY WICKED
SPORT," HE SAID,

1:45:53.899 --> 1:45:57.592
AND CLAY WAS A LOUDMOUTH,
SURE TO LOSE.

1:45:57.627 --> 1:46:00.733
HE ORDERED HIS NEWSPAPER
"MUHAMMAD SPEAKS"

1:46:00.768 --> 1:46:03.736
NOT TO COVER THE COMING FIGHT.

1:46:03.771 --> 1:46:06.394
MALCOLM X HAD A DIFFERENT VIEW.

1:46:06.429 --> 1:46:09.224
THE CONTEST WOULD PIT ISLAM
AGAINST CHRISTIANITY,

1:46:09.259 --> 1:46:15.127
HE SAID, AND CLAY--AND ISLAM--
WOULD EMERGE VICTORIOUS,

1:46:15.161 --> 1:46:18.095
BUT MALCOLM'S DESIRE TO
SEE CLAY SUCCEED

1:46:18.130 --> 1:46:20.926
HAD ANOTHER DIMENSION.

1:46:20.960 --> 1:46:24.032
BACK IN LATE NOVEMBER,
AFTER MALCOLM HAD SAID

1:46:24.067 --> 1:46:27.311
THAT THE ASSASSINATION
OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY

1:46:27.346 --> 1:46:30.867
HAD BEEN A CASE OF "CHICKENS
COMING HOME TO ROOST,"

1:46:30.901 --> 1:46:32.869
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD HAD CENSURED

1:46:32.903 --> 1:46:34.974
HIS CONTROVERSIAL MINISTER,

1:46:35.009 --> 1:46:37.080
ORDERING MALCOLM TO REFRAIN
FROM SPEAKING

1:46:37.114 --> 1:46:39.047
PUBLICLY OR PREACHING

1:46:39.082 --> 1:46:41.705
AT MOSQUE NO. 7 FOR 90 DAYS.

1:46:41.740 --> 1:46:43.569
I'VE BEEN
IN SILENCE FOR
THE PAST 90 DAYS

1:46:43.604 --> 1:46:45.260
BECAUSE OF SOME
STATEMENTS I MADE

1:46:45.295 --> 1:46:47.780
CONCERNING THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES,

1:46:47.815 --> 1:46:49.437
WHICH WERE DISTORTED.

1:46:49.472 --> 1:46:50.611
THEY
WERE DISTORTED?
YES.

1:46:50.645 --> 1:46:52.406
WHAT DID YOU SAY,
MALCOLM?

1:46:52.440 --> 1:46:53.890
WELL, I SAID THE SAME
THING THAT EVERYBODY SAYS,

1:46:53.924 --> 1:46:56.099
THAT HIS ASSASSINATION
WAS THE RESULT

1:46:56.133 --> 1:46:57.790
OF THE CLIMATE OF HATE.

1:46:57.825 --> 1:47:00.241
ONLY I SAID,
"THE CHICKENS
CAME HOME TO ROOST,"

1:47:00.275 --> 1:47:02.623
WHICH MEANS
THE SAME THING.

1:47:02.657 --> 1:47:05.419
THE REBUKE
HAD SHAKEN MALCOLM X.

1:47:05.453 --> 1:47:09.008
HE HAD APOLOGIZED INSTANTLY
AND BEGUN TRYING TO GET BACK

1:47:09.043 --> 1:47:11.977
INTO ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S
GOOD GRACES.

1:47:12.011 --> 1:47:14.151
IF HE COULD DELIVER
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION

1:47:14.186 --> 1:47:17.776
OF THE WORLD INTO THE FOLD,
PERHAPS ELIJAH MUHAMMAD

1:47:17.810 --> 1:47:20.261
WOULD FORGIVE HIM,

1:47:20.295 --> 1:47:24.127
BUT EVEN BEFORE THE SUSPENSION,
LONG-STANDING DIFFERENCES

1:47:24.161 --> 1:47:27.682
BETWEEN THE LEADER OF THE NATION
OF ISLAM AND MALCOLM X

1:47:27.717 --> 1:47:32.791
HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO THREATEN
HIS POSITION IN THE SECT.

1:47:32.825 --> 1:47:36.795
MALCOLM,
HE HAD POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS.

1:47:36.829 --> 1:47:38.624
HE THOUGHT THAT THE NATION
OF ISLAM SHOULD BE

1:47:38.659 --> 1:47:42.490
MORE ACTIVE
IN THE POLITICAL ARENA.

1:47:42.525 --> 1:47:44.492
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD
DIDN'T FEEL THAT WAY,

1:47:44.527 --> 1:47:47.391
AND THAT CAUSED FRICTION.

1:47:47.426 --> 1:47:49.946
MALCOLM HAD ALSO
BECOME DISILLUSIONED

1:47:49.980 --> 1:47:52.949
WITH WHAT HE VIEWED AS MORALLY
INDEFENSIBLE BEHAVIOR

1:47:52.983 --> 1:47:56.987
BY ELIJAH MUHAMMAD, INCLUDING
FINANCIAL CORRUPTION

1:47:57.022 --> 1:48:01.405
AND IMPREGNATING AT LEAST
7 OF HIS SECRETARIES.

1:48:01.440 --> 1:48:03.407
ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S LIEUTENANTS,

1:48:03.442 --> 1:48:06.963
WARY OF MALCOLM'S RISING
PUBLIC STATURE AND DETERMINED

1:48:06.997 --> 1:48:11.036
TO GUARD THEIR LEADER'S EXALTED
STATUS AMONG HIS DISCIPLES,

1:48:11.070 --> 1:48:14.177
WERE PLOTTING MALCOLM'S
PERMANENT EXPULSION

1:48:14.211 --> 1:48:17.491
FROM THE NATION OF ISLAM.

1:48:17.525 --> 1:48:20.045
A MONTH BEFORE
HIS BOUT WITH LISTON,

1:48:20.079 --> 1:48:22.530
CLAY HAD ADDRESSED
1,200 MUSLIMS GATHERED

1:48:22.565 --> 1:48:25.084
AT A BALLROOM IN HARLEM.

1:48:25.119 --> 1:48:28.812
"I AM A RACE MAN," HE SAID
TO LOUD APPLAUSE,

1:48:28.847 --> 1:48:33.230
"AND EVERY TIME I GO TO A MUSLIM
MEETING, I GET INSPIRED."

1:48:34.956 --> 1:48:37.821
CASSIUS CLAY SR. COMPLAINED
THAT THE MUSLIMS HAD BEEN

1:48:37.856 --> 1:48:40.444
BRAINWASHING HIS SON,

1:48:40.479 --> 1:48:43.862
AND WHEN THE FIGHTER WAS
SEEN IN MIAMI WITH MALCOLM X,

1:48:43.896 --> 1:48:47.106
IT SEEMED TO CONFIRM
THE RUMORS THAT CASSIUS CLAY

1:48:47.141 --> 1:48:49.799
HAD JOINED
THE NATION OF ISLAM.

1:48:52.042 --> 1:48:56.599
ON FEBRUARY 22, 1964,
3 DAYS BEFORE THE FIGHT,

1:48:56.633 --> 1:49:00.119
WITH TICKET SALES
WELL BELOW EXPECTATIONS,

1:49:00.154 --> 1:49:03.088
THE PROMOTER BILL MacDONALD,
WHO'D PUT UP HIS OWN MONEY

1:49:03.122 --> 1:49:05.746
TO STAGE THE BOUT, VISITED CLAY

1:49:05.780 --> 1:49:09.197
AND WARNED HIM THAT
THE FIGHT WOULD BE CALLED OFF

1:49:09.232 --> 1:49:11.786
IF HE DIDN'T DISAVOW
ANY ASSOCIATION

1:49:11.821 --> 1:49:14.375
WITH THE NATION OF ISLAM.

1:49:14.409 --> 1:49:16.550
CLAY REFUSED.

1:49:16.584 --> 1:49:18.137
"MY RELIGION'S MORE
IMPORTANT TO ME

1:49:18.172 --> 1:49:21.589
THAN THE FIGHT," HE TOLD
MacDONALD.

1:49:21.624 --> 1:49:23.936
FINALLY SOMEBODY GOES
TO MALCOLM AND SAYS,

1:49:23.971 --> 1:49:27.043
"LOOK, YOUR PRESENCE HERE IS
JEOPARDIZING THIS FIGHT.

1:49:27.077 --> 1:49:28.941
"IT'S GOING TO BE CALLED OFF.

1:49:28.976 --> 1:49:30.736
WILL YOU LEAVE?"

1:49:30.771 --> 1:49:33.739
AND MALCOLM SAYS,
"I'LL LEAVE, I'LL LEAVE FOR NOW,

1:49:33.774 --> 1:49:35.223
BUT I'M COMING BACK
FOR THE FIGHT."

1:49:35.258 --> 1:49:37.053
AND THEY SAY, "FINE."

1:49:37.087 --> 1:49:40.125
SO NOW MALCOLM LEAVES,
HE GOES BACK UP TO NEW YORK,

1:49:40.159 --> 1:49:41.782
THE FIGHT'S ON.

1:49:41.816 --> 1:49:44.163
I'M A CHAMP!

1:49:44.198 --> 1:49:45.958
I'M THE REAL CHAMP!

1:49:45.993 --> 1:49:47.960
ON THE MORNING
OF THE FIGHT, CASSIUS CLAY

1:49:47.995 --> 1:49:50.791
ARRIVED AT THE MIAMI
CONVENTION CENTER WEARING

1:49:50.825 --> 1:49:54.967
A BLUE DENIM JACKET WITH
THE WORDS "BEAR HUNTIN'"

1:49:55.002 --> 1:49:56.762
EMBROIDERED ON THE BACK.

1:49:56.797 --> 1:49:58.177
WHERE IS HE AT?

1:49:58.212 --> 1:50:00.007
I'M THE KING OF THE RING!

1:50:00.041 --> 1:50:01.940
I'M THE BIGGEST THING
IN HISTORY!

1:50:01.974 --> 1:50:03.976
HE WAS FLANKED
BY HIS BROTHER RUDY,

1:50:04.011 --> 1:50:07.324
SUGAR RAY ROBINSON,
ANGELO DUNDEE,

1:50:07.359 --> 1:50:10.155
WILLIAM FAVERSHAM
OF HIS LOUISVILLE SPONSORS,

1:50:10.189 --> 1:50:13.123
AND BUNDINI BROWN.

1:50:13.158 --> 1:50:15.643
YOU TELL JOE LOUIS
AND SONNY LISTON THAT I'M

1:50:15.678 --> 1:50:18.370
HERE WITH SUGAR RAY!

1:50:18.404 --> 1:50:19.958
JOE LOUIS IS FLATFOOTED,

1:50:19.992 --> 1:50:21.994
AND SONNY LISTON IS FLATFOOTED!

1:50:22.029 --> 1:50:23.927
SUGAR RAY AND I ARE
TWO PRETTY DANCERS!

1:50:23.962 --> 1:50:27.172
WE CAN'T BE BEAT!

1:50:27.206 --> 1:50:30.451
AN HOUR LATER, CLAY
EMERGED FROM HIS DRESSING ROOM

1:50:30.485 --> 1:50:32.108
AND HEADED FOR THE WEIGH-IN.

1:50:35.663 --> 1:50:38.666
I PREDICT THAT TONIGHT
SOMEBODY WILL DIE

1:50:38.701 --> 1:50:41.220
AT RINGSIDE FROM SHOCK.

1:50:41.255 --> 1:50:42.394
I NEVER SAW ANYTHING
LIKE IT IN MY LIFE

1:50:42.428 --> 1:50:43.982
AT A WEIGH-IN.

1:50:44.016 --> 1:50:45.535
I MEAN, I SAW GUYS
STARE EACH OTHER DOWN.

1:50:45.569 --> 1:50:48.400
THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
HE'S NUTS.

1:50:48.434 --> 1:50:52.473
IF HE'S PUTTING ON AN ACT,
HE SHOULD BE ON BROADWAY.

1:50:52.507 --> 1:50:54.648
EXCEPT HE WAS
PUTTING ON AN ACT.

1:50:54.682 --> 1:50:56.235
NOW LISTON COMES OUT.

1:50:56.270 --> 1:50:59.135
LISTON LOOKS AT HIM
AND SAYS, "SHUT UP."

1:50:59.169 --> 1:51:01.378
SEEMINGLY
UNPERTURBED BY CLAY'S HOWLING,

1:51:01.413 --> 1:51:03.484
LISTON POINTED OUT
THE ROUND HE EXPECTED

1:51:03.518 --> 1:51:06.349
THE FIGHT TO END.

1:51:09.870 --> 1:51:11.526
LET'S SEE THIS.

1:51:11.561 --> 1:51:12.976
YOU AIN'T GOT A CHANCE.

1:51:13.011 --> 1:51:14.598
LET US SEE,
LET US SEE!

1:51:14.633 --> 1:51:16.739
AIN'T NO WAY YOU CAN TAKE ME,
AND YOU KNOW IT!

1:51:16.773 --> 1:51:18.257
THE FINE IS $2,500

1:51:18.292 --> 1:51:20.604
FOR HIS CONDUCT
ON THE PLATFORM.

1:51:20.639 --> 1:51:23.746
AND ADDING TO THE SCENE
THE FRIGGIN' COMMISSION DOCTOR

1:51:23.780 --> 1:51:26.196
SAYS, "I JUST TOOK
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE.

1:51:26.231 --> 1:51:28.095
"IT'S TWICE WHAT IT SHOULD
BE FOR A HEALTHY MAN,

1:51:28.129 --> 1:51:29.717
"NORMAL MAN.

1:51:29.752 --> 1:51:32.582
HIS HEART LOOKS LIKE
IT'S GONNA EXPLODE."

1:51:32.616 --> 1:51:34.342
THE DOCTOR WHO
TOOK THE READING WORRIED

1:51:34.377 --> 1:51:36.103
THAT CLAY WAS GRIPPED
BY WHAT HE CALLED

1:51:36.137 --> 1:51:39.554
"MORTAL FEAR" AND WONDERED IF
IT WAS EVEN SAFE

1:51:39.589 --> 1:51:42.040
FOR HIM TO FIGHT,

1:51:42.074 --> 1:51:44.387
BUT AN HOUR LATER
WHEN CLAY'S OWN DOCTOR TESTED

1:51:44.421 --> 1:51:49.564
HIM AGAIN, EVERYTHING
HAD RETURNED TO NORMAL.

1:51:49.599 --> 1:51:53.465
CLAY WENT HOME AND TOOK A NAP.

1:51:53.499 --> 1:51:55.950
MY RADIO'S ON,
AND THE NEWS COMES ON.

1:51:55.985 --> 1:51:58.781
THERE'S A BULLETIN.
CASSIUS CLAY WAS SPOTTED

1:51:58.815 --> 1:52:01.369
AT MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
BUYING A TICKET

1:52:01.404 --> 1:52:03.302
FOR A FOREIGN COUNTRY.

1:52:03.337 --> 1:52:07.444
THE RUMOR THROUGH
THE PRESS ROW WAS THAT

1:52:07.479 --> 1:52:11.069
HE WAS AT THE AIRPORT,
THAT HE HAD RUN AWAY,

1:52:11.103 --> 1:52:13.416
THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE BUILDING,

1:52:13.450 --> 1:52:15.970
AND OTHER REPORTERS,
THEY WERE FILING THIS

1:52:16.005 --> 1:52:19.733
AND SPREADING THIS,
AND I KIND OF WANDERED AROUND,

1:52:19.767 --> 1:52:23.322
AND I SAW HIM WATCHING
HIS KID BROTHER RUDY

1:52:23.357 --> 1:52:24.876
HAVE HIS FIRST FIGHT.

1:52:24.910 --> 1:52:26.463
KEEP MOVING
AND JAB!

1:52:28.465 --> 1:52:30.226
TAKE YOUR TIME.GOOD GOING, RUDY.

1:52:30.260 --> 1:52:31.779
WATCH HIM! HOOK HIM!

1:52:31.814 --> 1:52:33.747
HE'S STANDING
IN THE AISLE,

1:52:33.781 --> 1:52:36.232
AND HE'S GIVING IN--HE'S GONNA
FIGHT FOR THE WORLD TITLE.

1:52:36.266 --> 1:52:37.992
HE'S GIVING INSTRUCTIONS
TO HIS BROTHER

1:52:38.027 --> 1:52:39.511
IN A 4-ROUND FIGHT.

1:52:39.545 --> 1:52:43.239
THIS GUY SEEMS
TO HAVE FOOLED ALL OF US.

1:52:43.273 --> 1:52:46.863
HE'S TIRED.
TIE HIM UP!
TIE HIM UP!

1:52:50.315 --> 1:52:51.972
BUT BACK
IN HIS DRESSING ROOM,

1:52:52.006 --> 1:52:53.836
THINGS GREW TENSE.

1:52:53.870 --> 1:52:56.424
CLAY FIDGETED NERVOUSLY.

1:52:56.459 --> 1:52:58.944
HIS DOCTOR FERDIE PACHECO
NOTICED HE WAS

1:52:58.979 --> 1:53:02.430
UNCHARACTERISTICALLY
ANXIOUS.

1:53:02.465 --> 1:53:05.192
NOW HE GETS WORRIED,
HE'S PARANOID.

1:53:05.226 --> 1:53:09.092
HIS BROTHERS
IN THE NATION HAD SAID,

1:53:09.127 --> 1:53:10.818
"BE AWARE OF THE WHITE DEVIL.

1:53:10.853 --> 1:53:12.130
"THEY'RE GOING TO DO
SOMETHING TO MAKE YOU LOSE.

1:53:12.164 --> 1:53:14.028
"THE MONEY IS BET
ON SONNY LISTON.

1:53:14.063 --> 1:53:16.168
"THE MOB'S INVOLVED
WITH THIS SPORT.

1:53:16.203 --> 1:53:18.446
BE AWARE."

1:53:18.481 --> 1:53:21.311
THEN HE SEES A WATER BOTTLE,
AND HE THINKS,

1:53:21.346 --> 1:53:22.934
"THERE COULD BE
SOMETHING IN THAT WATER."

1:53:22.968 --> 1:53:24.487
SO HE DUMPS THE WATER OUT.

1:53:24.521 --> 1:53:26.109
THEN HE FILLS IT UP AGAIN.

1:53:26.144 --> 1:53:28.318
THEN HE TAPES THE TOP
OF THE WATER BOTTLE,

1:53:28.353 --> 1:53:29.526
AND HE GIVES IT TO HIS BROTHER,
AND HE SAYS,

1:53:29.561 --> 1:53:31.839
"YOU WATCH OVER THIS."

1:53:31.874 --> 1:53:34.877
LATER, MALCOLM X
JOINED CASSIUS AND RUDY

1:53:34.911 --> 1:53:40.883
AS THEY FACED EAST, BOWED,
AND PRAYED TO ALLAH.

1:53:46.198 --> 1:53:47.821
LISTON IN
THE FOURTH ROUND BECAUSE

1:53:47.855 --> 1:53:50.858
I REALLY THINK LISTON IS GOING
TO SHOW THAT MAN

1:53:50.893 --> 1:53:54.862
HIS MOUTHPIECE AIN'T VALUABLE.

1:53:54.897 --> 1:53:56.415
FIGHTS ARE ALWAYS
WON WITH FISTS

1:53:56.450 --> 1:53:58.072
AND NOT WITH MOUTH TALK.

1:53:58.107 --> 1:54:00.143
I PICK LISTON TO WIN
BY THE FIFTH ROUND.

1:54:00.178 --> 1:54:01.731
THIRD ROUND.
FIFTH ROUND.

1:54:01.765 --> 1:54:04.285
I EXPECT
IN ABOUT TWO ROUNDS.

1:54:07.047 --> 1:54:10.982
AT 10 P.M.,
THE FIGHTERS ENTERED THE ARENA.

1:54:11.016 --> 1:54:13.881
CLAY WAS AN 8-TO-1 UNDERDOG.

1:54:20.198 --> 1:54:23.511
THIS BOUT,
15 ROUNDS,

1:54:23.546 --> 1:54:28.516
FOR THE HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE WORLD.

1:54:28.551 --> 1:54:31.105
WHEN THE TWO MEN MET
IN THE RING

1:54:31.140 --> 1:54:34.005
JUST BEFORE THE FIGHT BEGAN FOR
THE RING INSTRUCTIONS,

1:54:34.039 --> 1:54:39.527
I WAS STRUCK BY HOW MUCH BIGGER
CASSIUS CLAY WAS

1:54:39.562 --> 1:54:41.046
THAN SONNY LISTON.

1:54:41.081 --> 1:54:43.600
HE WAS TALLER, HE WAS BROAD.

1:54:43.635 --> 1:54:46.120
WAS NOT QUITE AS THICK,

1:54:46.155 --> 1:54:49.779
BUT THIS IS NOT DAVID
AND GOLIATH BY ANY MEANS.

1:54:49.813 --> 1:54:51.125
BREAK, STOP PUNCHING,
AND STEP BACK.

1:54:51.160 --> 1:54:52.264
GOOD LUCK.

1:54:52.299 --> 1:54:53.645
SHAKE HANDS.

1:54:58.857 --> 1:55:00.445
CASSIUS CLAY

1:55:00.479 --> 1:55:01.791
ON THE MOVE AS WE SEE,

1:55:01.825 --> 1:55:04.276
LOOKING TO GET SONNY TO LUNGE.

1:55:04.311 --> 1:55:07.970
CARRYING HIS LEFT
HAND DANGEROUSLY LOW.

1:55:08.004 --> 1:55:10.904
LISTON HAD A JAB
THAT COULD KNOCK YOU OUT.

1:55:10.938 --> 1:55:14.079
JAB, JAB, AND WHEN THAT RIGHT
HAND CAME IN, IT WAS OVER.

1:55:14.114 --> 1:55:17.980
I THINK HE HAD
EXPECTED TO DO THAT.

1:55:18.014 --> 1:55:21.052
IT BECOMES THE BULL
AND THE MATADOR.

1:55:21.086 --> 1:55:22.950
CLAY IS BOOM, BOOM,

1:55:22.985 --> 1:55:26.057
AND LISTON IS SHOCKED.

1:55:26.091 --> 1:55:30.440
WE'RE HALFWAY
THROUGH ROUND ONE.

1:55:30.475 --> 1:55:35.998
CASSIUS HAS
THE MASK OF CONFIDENCE.

1:55:36.032 --> 1:55:40.312
"I MAY BE RETREATING
BUT YOU'RE CHASING ME,

1:55:40.347 --> 1:55:42.970
AND I'M SETTING TRAPS
FOR YOU."

1:55:43.005 --> 1:55:44.523
THE RIGHT HAND,
THE BEST PUNCH

1:55:44.558 --> 1:55:46.698
OF THE FIGHT SO FAR.

1:55:46.732 --> 1:55:49.183
"YOU FOLLOW ME AROUND
EVERYWHERE YOU GO,

1:55:49.218 --> 1:55:52.324
I'LL SLAP YOU AGAIN."

1:55:52.359 --> 1:55:54.154
SONNY HAD NEVER SEEN
THAT BEFORE.

1:55:54.188 --> 1:55:56.087
HE WASN'T PREPARED FOR IT.

1:55:56.121 --> 1:55:57.881
WE'RE DOWN TO
THE CLOSING SECOND

1:55:57.916 --> 1:56:00.470
OF THIS FIRST ROUND,
AND THE LONG LEFT LEAD

1:56:00.505 --> 1:56:03.784
IS MAKING THE DIFFERENCE
SO FAR BY MR. CLAY.

1:56:03.818 --> 1:56:05.993
HE'S THROWING HIS SHOTS
WITH HIS HANDS DOWN.

1:56:06.028 --> 1:56:07.546
YOU DON'T THROW THOSE KIND
OF SHOTS UNLESS YOU

1:56:07.581 --> 1:56:10.273
TRUST YOUR TALENT.

1:56:12.034 --> 1:56:14.001
THE REFEREE DID
NOT STOP THAT ROUND

1:56:14.036 --> 1:56:15.520
WHEN THAT BELL SOUNDED.

1:56:15.554 --> 1:56:17.280
PERHAPS THE REFEREE
DIDN'T HEAR IT.

1:56:17.315 --> 1:56:19.489
INTO THE CORNER IS CASSIUS CLAY,
WHO IS STILL DOING

1:56:19.524 --> 1:56:21.319
THE TALKING.

1:56:21.353 --> 1:56:23.217
CHAMPION JOE LOUIS.

1:56:23.252 --> 1:56:24.839
WELL, STEVE, I THINK
THIS WAS THE GREATEST ROUND

1:56:24.874 --> 1:56:26.807
OF ANY A FIGHT WE'VE
SEEN IN A LONG TIME.

1:56:26.841 --> 1:56:29.154
I HOPE THAT CLAY DON'T GET
TOO MUCH CONFIDENCE,

1:56:29.189 --> 1:56:31.950
OR HE GONNA GET
KNOCKED OUT.

1:56:35.402 --> 1:56:37.887
THIS YOUNGSTER
HAS HIS OWN STYLE,

1:56:37.921 --> 1:56:40.165
AND IT'S CONFUSING FOR
THE CHAMPION TO FATHOM

1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:41.891
THIS EARLY IN THE FIGHT.

1:56:44.514 --> 1:56:46.758
WHEN CLAY CAME OUT
IN THE THIRD,

1:56:46.792 --> 1:56:49.036
HE'S SHOOTING JABS THAT WERE
LIKE RAZORBLADES.

1:56:49.071 --> 1:56:51.038
WOBBLED!
SONNY WOBBLED!

1:56:51.073 --> 1:56:54.317
CASSIUS HAS HIM HURT!

1:56:54.352 --> 1:56:57.493
SONNY'S ESSENTIALLY
TAMED BY THIS POINT.

1:56:57.527 --> 1:57:00.427
HE VERBALLY
CHALLENGES THE CHAMPION.

1:57:00.461 --> 1:57:04.431
NOBODY BELIEVED THIS
GUY COULD DO THIS TO LISTON,

1:57:04.465 --> 1:57:09.263
AND HE DOMINATES THE ROUND.

1:57:09.298 --> 1:57:11.714
THERE WAS NO QUESTION
CLAY TOOK CONTROL

1:57:11.748 --> 1:57:14.337
OF THE FIGHT VERY QUICKLY.

1:57:14.372 --> 1:57:18.962
HE HIT LISTON AT WILL,
OPENED A CUT UNDER HIS EYE.

1:57:18.997 --> 1:57:22.207
IT WAS THE FIRST
TIME IN 34 PROFESSIONAL FIGHTS

1:57:22.242 --> 1:57:24.727
THAT SONNY LISTON HAD BEEN CUT.

1:57:26.970 --> 1:57:29.111
THE CHAMPION IS
STRONG, DURABLE,

1:57:29.145 --> 1:57:30.905
TAKES THE GOOD SHOT.

1:57:30.940 --> 1:57:34.357
HOWEVER, HE IS BEING
OUTMANEUVERED AT MOST POINTS

1:57:34.392 --> 1:57:37.257
BECAUSE THIS FELLOW
HAS THAT AWKWARDLY FAST STYLE

1:57:37.291 --> 1:57:39.638
OF GOING SIDE TO SIDE,
MOVING THE UPPER PART

1:57:39.673 --> 1:57:42.917
OF HIS BODY.

1:57:42.952 --> 1:57:45.713
HALF A MINUTE MORE
IN ROUND NUMBER 4.

1:57:45.748 --> 1:57:47.922
DURING
THE FOURTH ROUND,

1:57:47.957 --> 1:57:50.960
SOMETHING GETS IN CLAY'S EYES.

1:57:50.994 --> 1:57:54.826
AND WE CAN START
TO SEE HIM BLINKING.

1:57:54.860 --> 1:57:58.312
AT ONE POINT THAT LISTON
RUBS HIS GLOVES IN A CLINCH

1:57:58.347 --> 1:58:00.970
ACROSS CLAY'S EYES.

1:58:01.004 --> 1:58:02.592
MY GUESS IS THAT'S
WHERE SOMETHING GOT

1:58:02.627 --> 1:58:05.457
IN CLAY'S EYES.

1:58:05.492 --> 1:58:08.426
AT THE END OF THE FOURTH ROUND,
CLAY GOES BACK TO HIS CORNER,

1:58:08.460 --> 1:58:10.807
AND BY NOW HE'S IN PAIN.

1:58:10.842 --> 1:58:12.430
HE CAN'T SEE,

1:58:12.464 --> 1:58:15.674
AND HE SAYS TO ANGELO,
"CUT THEM OFF.

1:58:15.709 --> 1:58:20.093
CUT THE GLOVES OFF.
I'M DONE. I CAN'T FIGHT."

1:58:20.127 --> 1:58:24.476
THE CROWD IS GOING BATSHIT.

1:58:24.511 --> 1:58:28.584
THE OTHER CORNER
SENSES BLOOD,

1:58:28.618 --> 1:58:33.623
AND DUNDEE DOES THE BEST HE CAN
TO WIPE HIS EYES CLEAN,

1:58:33.658 --> 1:58:38.525
AND HE BASICALLY PUSHES HIM
BACK INTO THE FIGHT.

1:58:38.559 --> 1:58:40.492
THEY'RE YELLING
FROM CASSIUS CLAY'S CORNER

1:58:40.527 --> 1:58:43.150
SOMETHING GOT
IN HIS RIGHT EYE.

1:58:43.185 --> 1:58:45.601
HOWEVER, HE'S BLINKING BADLY.

1:58:45.635 --> 1:58:47.844
AND IT IS QUITE
POSSIBLE THAT THIS WAS

1:58:47.879 --> 1:58:50.330
A DELIBERATE ACT ON BY LISTON
AND THE LISTON CORNER

1:58:50.364 --> 1:58:53.298
TO PUT WHAT'S CALLED LINIMENT
ON THE GLOVES, WHICH EVENTUALLY

1:58:53.333 --> 1:58:55.611
ARE GONNA GET
IN THE OTHER GUY'S EYES.

1:58:55.645 --> 1:58:58.545
AND THE CHORUS
FROM CLAY'S CORNER WAS

1:58:58.579 --> 1:59:01.272
STAY THE HELL AWAY,
STAY THE HELL AWAY.

1:59:01.306 --> 1:59:03.446
STAY
THE HELL AWAY.

1:59:03.481 --> 1:59:05.379
WHEN THAT HAPPENED,
WHEN I LAST SAW HIM BLIND

1:59:05.414 --> 1:59:09.176
LIKE THAT, I SAID,
"THEY DONE GOT TO US."

1:59:09.211 --> 1:59:11.144
SONNY'S GONNA TRY
TO PULL IT OFF.

1:59:11.178 --> 1:59:13.249
"THEY DONE GOT TO US."

1:59:17.046 --> 1:59:20.049
CASSIUS STILL HAVING
SOME PROBLEMS

1:59:20.083 --> 1:59:21.809
WITH HIS--WITH HIS EYES.

1:59:21.844 --> 1:59:23.535
HE'S BLINKING,
AND HE'S BOUNCING

1:59:23.570 --> 1:59:25.158
AWAY CONTINUALLY.

1:59:27.367 --> 1:59:31.543
CLAY SOMEHOW
SURVIVED THE FIFTH ROUND.

1:59:31.578 --> 1:59:34.201
IN ROUND 6,
HIS EYES CLEAR,

1:59:34.236 --> 1:59:36.755
CLAY STOOD FLATFOOTED
AND LAUNCHED JABS

1:59:36.790 --> 1:59:40.069
AT LISTON'S HEAD, SWELLING
THE CHAMP'S CHEEKS,

1:59:40.103 --> 1:59:41.864
AND DRAWING
MORE BLOOD FROM THE CUT

1:59:41.898 --> 1:59:45.074
BENEATH HIS LEFT EYE.

1:59:45.108 --> 1:59:49.941
EASY TARGET. EASY.

1:59:49.975 --> 1:59:54.117
IF A FIGHTER ESCAPES
GETTING THAT DONE TO HIM,

1:59:54.152 --> 1:59:58.225
THE AMOUNT OF VENOM THAT
THE FIGHTER'S GONNA IMPRESS

1:59:58.260 --> 2:00:01.366
TO HIS OPPONENT IS INCREASED,
LIKE, PROFOUNDLY, MAN.

2:00:01.401 --> 2:00:03.575
I'M TRYING TO HURT
YOU WORSE BECAUSE

2:00:03.610 --> 2:00:05.991
YOU TRIED TO CHEAT ME.

2:00:08.270 --> 2:00:10.341
SONNY CAN'T SEEM
TO SLIP OR KNOCK DOWN

2:00:10.375 --> 2:00:12.550
THAT JAB EFFECTIVELY.

2:00:12.584 --> 2:00:15.622
CASSIUS THROWS IT
FROM ALL ANGLES.

2:00:15.656 --> 2:00:18.072
THE CROWD'S NOW CHEERING
THE CHALLENGER.

2:00:18.107 --> 2:00:20.109
LET'S GET OVER TO OUR
CHAMPION JOE LOUIS.

2:00:20.143 --> 2:00:22.111
JOE, WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS GOING ON

2:00:22.145 --> 2:00:24.044
IN SONNY'S MIND
AT THIS POINT?

2:00:24.078 --> 2:00:25.908
WELL, I THINK SONNY
NOW'S BEGINNING TO WORRY NOW.

2:00:25.942 --> 2:00:28.428
AT LEAST HIS CORNER IS BEGINNING
TO WORRY NOW BECAUSE...

2:00:28.462 --> 2:00:30.464
AS CLAY AWAITED
THE BELL SIGNALING

2:00:30.499 --> 2:00:34.088
THE START OF ROUND 7,
HE TURNED TO THE REPORTERS

2:00:34.123 --> 2:00:36.159
SEATED BESIDE THE RING.

2:00:36.194 --> 2:00:40.163
"I'M GONNA UPSET THE WORLD!"
HE YELLED AT THEM.

2:00:40.198 --> 2:00:42.890
IN LISTON'S CORNER,
TRAINERS MASSAGED

2:00:42.925 --> 2:00:46.653
THE CHAMP'S MUSCLES AND RUBBED
VASELINE ON HIS BROW.

2:00:46.687 --> 2:00:48.413
OH, I THINK
THE CORNER MEN ARE BEGINNING TO

2:00:48.448 --> 2:00:50.001
WORRY A LITTLE BIT NOW.

2:00:50.035 --> 2:00:52.003
LISTON NOW I THINK HE DON'T
SEE TOO WELL OUT

2:00:52.037 --> 2:00:54.419
OF BOTH HIS EYES NOW
THEY MAY WELL PUCK OUT.

2:00:54.454 --> 2:00:57.077
AFTER ONE TRAINER PUT
IN HIS MOUTHPIECE,

2:00:57.111 --> 2:00:59.735
LISTON SPIT IT OUT.

2:01:01.219 --> 2:01:02.772
THEY MIGHT BE
STOPPING IT.

2:01:02.807 --> 2:01:04.671
THAT MIGHT BE ALL,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

2:01:04.705 --> 2:01:07.190
HE WAS FINISHED.

2:01:07.225 --> 2:01:09.917
CASSIUS MARCELLUS CLAY JR.

2:01:09.952 --> 2:01:13.300
WAS NOW THE HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION OF THE WORLD.

2:01:18.063 --> 2:01:20.445
I MUST BE THE GREATEST!

2:01:20.480 --> 2:01:24.932
I AM THE KING OF THE WORLD!
I'M A BAD MAN!

2:01:24.967 --> 2:01:27.625
HE HAD LINIMENT ON HIS HANDS,
HE HAD LINIMENT IN HIS GLOVES.

2:01:27.659 --> 2:01:30.973
MY WHOLE FACE WAS BURNING.

2:01:31.007 --> 2:01:32.526
I AM THE GREATEST!

2:01:32.561 --> 2:01:34.183
ALL I GOT TO SAY IS
I BEAT LISTON LIKE

2:01:34.217 --> 2:01:35.667
HE WAS AN AMATEUR.

2:01:35.702 --> 2:01:37.497
I HELD MY HANDS LOW,
I LEANED BACK,

2:01:37.531 --> 2:01:39.292
I'M STILL PRETTY.

2:01:39.326 --> 2:01:41.155
HE WAS THE ONE ALL CUT UP.
I SHOOK UP THE WORLD.

2:01:41.190 --> 2:01:43.779
NOW WHAT ARE YOU ALL GOING
TO SAY ABOUT THAT NOW, HUH?

2:01:43.813 --> 2:01:45.953
AFTER THE FIGHT,
SONNY LISTON WAS TAKEN

2:01:45.988 --> 2:01:47.679
TO THE HOSPITAL.

2:01:47.714 --> 2:01:49.543
"THAT WASN'T THE GUY I
WAS SUPPOSED TO FIGHT,"

2:01:49.578 --> 2:01:50.855
HE MUTTERED.

2:01:50.889 --> 2:01:53.340
"THAT GUY COULD HIT."

2:01:53.375 --> 2:01:54.997
BACK TO THE MICROPHONE,
CASSIUS,

2:01:55.031 --> 2:01:56.688
TO ANSWER
SOME QUESTIONS.

2:01:56.723 --> 2:01:57.827
ALL YOU REPORTERS--
ALL OF YOU REPORTERS

2:01:57.862 --> 2:01:59.242
MADE IT HARD ON LISTON.

2:01:59.277 --> 2:02:00.243
NEVER WRITE ABOUT ME
LIKE THAT.

2:02:00.278 --> 2:02:02.038
NEVER MAKE ME 6-1.

2:02:02.073 --> 2:02:03.557
IT JUST MAKE ME ANGRY.

2:02:03.592 --> 2:02:05.801
NEVER MAKE ME NO UNDERDOG
AND NEVER TALK

2:02:05.835 --> 2:02:07.389
ABOUT WHO'S GONNA STOP ME.

2:02:07.423 --> 2:02:09.356
AIN'T NOBODY GONNA STOP ME!

2:02:09.391 --> 2:02:11.669
NOT A HEAVYWEIGHT IN THE WORLD
FAST ENOUGH TO STOP ME!

2:02:11.703 --> 2:02:15.500
OH, I'M SO PRETTY.
I SHOOK UP THE WORLD.

2:02:15.535 --> 2:02:17.537
NOW I'M THROUGH TALKING.

2:02:17.571 --> 2:02:19.159
I'M THROUGH TALKING.

2:02:19.193 --> 2:02:22.196
NOW YOU WRITE--
YOU WRITE THE RESULTS.

2:02:22.231 --> 2:02:24.060
I LIKE CLAY'S STYLE.

2:02:24.095 --> 2:02:27.995
I LIKE THAT OLD 1-2-3,
3-4-5.

2:02:28.030 --> 2:02:33.346
LET'S GET TOGETHER
GET SOME OLD...WIDE.

2:02:33.380 --> 2:02:35.106
HE'S THE GREATEST
OF THEM ALL!

2:02:35.140 --> 2:02:36.935
HE'S THE GREATEST!

2:02:36.970 --> 2:02:39.179
FLY LIKE A BUTTERFLY,
STING LIKE A BEE.

2:02:39.213 --> 2:02:41.250
CASSIUS CLAY!

2:02:41.284 --> 2:02:42.941
3, 2, 1!

2:02:42.976 --> 2:02:44.253
WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION CASSIUS CLAY

2:02:44.287 --> 2:02:45.772
IN PERSON.

2:02:45.806 --> 2:02:47.601
I'M THE GREATEST
THING IN THE WORLD.

2:02:47.636 --> 2:02:49.085
YOU THE GREATEST,
BABY.

2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:51.847
I'M A BAD MAN.
I'M A BAD MAN.

2:02:51.881 --> 2:02:53.089
YOU THE GREATEST!

2:02:53.124 --> 2:02:54.367
I DIDN'T STOP HIM.

2:02:54.401 --> 2:02:55.609
I SENT HIM TO THE HOSPITAL.

2:02:55.644 --> 2:02:59.958
I GOT TO BE BAD!
I GOT TO BE BAD!

2:02:59.993 --> 2:03:02.961
OH! IT FEELS SO GOOD TO BE ABLE
TO HOLLER

2:03:02.996 --> 2:03:06.379
WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE BAD.

2:03:06.413 --> 2:03:08.588
UNPREPARED
FOR CLAY'S VICTORY,

2:03:08.622 --> 2:03:11.453
THE LOUISVILLE SPONSORING GROUP
RUSHED TO ARRANGE

2:03:11.487 --> 2:03:14.559
A CELEBRATION IN MIAMI BEACH,

2:03:14.594 --> 2:03:17.907
BUT CASSIUS CLAY
HAD OTHER PLANS.

2:03:17.942 --> 2:03:20.289
AFTER MIDNIGHT, HE HEADED
TO THE CAFEÉ

2:03:20.323 --> 2:03:25.984
OF THE ALL-BLACK HAMPTON HOUSE,
WHERE HE ATE VANILLA ICE CREAM.

2:03:26.019 --> 2:03:31.093
LATER, CLAY, MALCOLM X,
FOOTBALL STAR JIM BROWN,

2:03:31.127 --> 2:03:35.166
AND SINGER SAM COOKE
TALKED LONG INTO THE NIGHT

2:03:35.200 --> 2:03:39.066
ABOUT THE 22-YEAR-OLD
BOXER'S FUTURE.

2:03:39.101 --> 2:03:42.829
FROM NOW ON, EVERYTHING
WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

2:03:42.863 --> 2:03:45.659
HE HAD SCALED BOXING'S
HIGHEST PEAK,

2:03:45.694 --> 2:03:50.077
WOULD NO LONGER NEED TO CAMPAIGN
FOR A SHOT AT THE TITLE

2:03:50.112 --> 2:03:53.356
OR CONCEAL HIS MUSLIM FAITH.

2:03:59.121 --> 2:04:01.779
NEXT MORNING,
HE'S MORE SUBDUED.

2:04:01.813 --> 2:04:04.506
HE'S THE HEAVYWEIGHT
CHAMPION OF THE WORLD.

2:04:04.540 --> 2:04:07.301
NEW RESPONSIBILITIES
HAVE BEEN ACCORDED HIM.

2:04:07.336 --> 2:04:09.165
BECAUSE I'M THE WORLD
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION NOW,

2:04:09.200 --> 2:04:11.927
I DON'T HAVE TO HOLLER
AND BRAG AS LOUD AS I USED TO.

2:04:11.961 --> 2:04:13.860
I'M WHERE I WANT TO BE NOW.

2:04:13.894 --> 2:04:16.310
SO ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE

2:04:16.345 --> 2:04:17.622
TELL ME ABOUT HOW GREAT I AM.

2:04:17.657 --> 2:04:19.452
I'M THROUGH TALKING.

2:04:19.486 --> 2:04:21.350
HE ALSO MAKES A REALLY
IMPORTANT DECLARATION.

2:04:21.384 --> 2:04:24.940
I DON'T HAVE TO BE
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO BE.

2:04:24.974 --> 2:04:26.631
I'M FREE TO BE WHAT I WANT
TO BE AND THINK WHAT I

2:04:26.666 --> 2:04:28.219
WANT TO THINK.

2:04:28.253 --> 2:04:29.600
BOOM.

2:04:29.634 --> 2:04:31.602
MUHAMMAD ALI IS BORN.

2:07:11.209 --> 2:07:12.625
HEY!

2:07:13.729 --> 2:07:15.006
HEY!

2:07:16.214 --> 2:07:17.871
HEY!

2:07:19.183 --> 2:07:20.460
HEY!

2:07:21.875 --> 2:07:23.152
HEY!

2:07:24.429 --> 2:07:25.845
HEY!

2:07:27.156 --> 2:07:28.571
HEY!

2:07:29.745 --> 2:07:31.540
HEY!

2:07:31.574 --> 2:07:32.990
YOU GONNA FLOAT
LIKE A BUTTERFLY

2:07:33.024 --> 2:07:34.370
AND STING LIKE A BEE.

2:07:34.405 --> 2:07:35.682
AHH!

2:07:35.717 --> 2:07:37.650
RUMBLE, YOUNG MAN,
RUMBLE.

2:07:37.684 --> 2:07:39.203
AHH!
