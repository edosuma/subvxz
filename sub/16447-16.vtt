WEBVTT

00:04.569 --> 00:06.569
Go!
(inhales deeply)

00:06.571 --> 00:07.303
Come on, Raj!

00:07.305 --> 00:08.204
LEONARD:
You can do this!

00:08.206 --> 00:09.238
There's no way.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.340
What is happening?

00:10.342 --> 00:11.341
This is an Euler's Disk.

00:11.343 --> 00:12.342
It's a physics toy

00:12.344 --> 00:13.810
that demonstrates
angular momentum,

00:13.812 --> 00:15.979
potential energy,
and kinetic energy.

00:15.981 --> 00:18.147
Aw, look at you
watching sports.

00:19.017 --> 00:20.316
We're betting to see
if Koothrappali

00:20.318 --> 00:21.250
can hold his breath

00:21.252 --> 00:22.685
longer than the
disk can spin.

00:22.687 --> 00:24.187
Its weight and smoothness,

00:24.189 --> 00:26.756
along with the slight concavity
of the mirror, means it can spin

00:26.758 --> 00:28.024
for a long time.

00:28.026 --> 00:29.492
But Raj is from India,
which means

00:29.494 --> 00:31.694
he's no slouch
at holding his breath.

00:32.831 --> 00:34.831
Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says
I'll lose interest

00:34.833 --> 00:37.867
before that thing
stops spinning.

00:39.037 --> 00:40.903
Hey, Sheldon, I found a great
restaurant for date night.

00:40.905 --> 00:42.205
Kind of busy right now.

00:42.207 --> 00:44.741
Oh, an Euler's Disk! Fun!
Yeah, we're seeing

00:44.743 --> 00:46.743
if Raj can hold his
breath longer than it.

00:46.745 --> 00:48.711
Oh. Immature.

00:49.681 --> 00:50.880
How ya doing?

00:50.882 --> 00:51.881
Mm.

00:51.883 --> 00:53.216
He's not gonna make it.

00:53.218 --> 00:54.884
Yes, he is!
You know,

00:54.886 --> 00:57.553
deep-sea divers holding
their breath for several minutes

00:57.555 --> 00:59.489
have shown elevated markers
of a protein

00:59.491 --> 01:01.424
that can signal brain damage.

01:01.426 --> 01:04.560
Yeah, see, what's happening here
signals brain damage.

01:05.263 --> 01:06.295
(muffled groaning)

01:06.297 --> 01:07.864
My God, how long does
this thing spin for?

01:07.866 --> 01:11.000
Ha! You're interested!
You're out ten bucks!

01:11.002 --> 01:13.102
It's slowing down!
Dig deep!

01:13.104 --> 01:16.005
Like when we bet you couldn't
fit into Howard's pants!

01:17.776 --> 01:18.508
(groaning)

01:18.510 --> 01:19.542
He's not gonna make it!

01:19.544 --> 01:20.343
Yes, he is!

01:20.345 --> 01:21.644
Come on, Raj!
It's like

01:21.646 --> 01:25.081
your favorite movie!
You're just <i>Waiting to Exhale!</i>

01:28.420 --> 01:29.652
(exhales)

01:29.654 --> 01:31.821
Yeah! I knew you
could do it!

01:32.857 --> 01:34.924
(panting):
And j.. and just so you know,

01:34.926 --> 01:36.759
my favorite movie...

(line ringing)
(sighs)

02:12.365 --> 02:14.332
Hello, Rajesh.
How are things by you?

02:14.334 --> 02:15.433
Good, good.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.602
Uh, listen,
I just wanted to let you know

02:17.604 --> 02:19.103
when you get
my credit card bill,

02:19.105 --> 02:21.005
it might be a little high
this month.

02:21.007 --> 02:23.274
Well, you're a grown man
with a steady job.

02:23.276 --> 02:27.045
Why wouldn't you spend
all your father's money?

02:27.047 --> 02:31.382
(chuckling): Oh, Daddy,
you're so rich and funny.

02:31.384 --> 02:34.552
Yeah. So what else is going on
with your life?

02:34.554 --> 02:37.689
Uh, well, I was dating a woman
at the university,

02:37.691 --> 02:39.057
but we broke up.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.959
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:40.961 --> 02:44.028
I know you are. That's why
you just bought me a new iPad.

02:45.465 --> 02:46.764
And before you start,

02:46.766 --> 02:49.834
I am not interested in
you arranging a marriage for me.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.236
Oh, I gave up on that
a long time ago.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.304
You did?

02:53.306 --> 02:54.672
It's too much work.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.107
You're an adult who can't get by

02:56.109 --> 02:58.176
without an allowance
from his parents.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.844
Women don't want that.

02:59.846 --> 03:03.014
Wh-What are you saying,
that y-you're giving up on me?

03:03.016 --> 03:05.283
What kind of father gives up
on his son?

03:05.285 --> 03:06.584
I have six children,

03:06.586 --> 03:08.886
five of whom are married
and self-sufficient.

03:08.888 --> 03:12.323
I don't think I'm the problem.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.859
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.295
This is deeply hurtful.

03:17.297 --> 03:18.363
You're also too sensitive.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.132
Women don't want that either.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.270
The food here's
supposed to be great.

03:26.272 --> 03:27.638
Don't fill up
on chips.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.374
Oh, I won't.
I have a trick.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.976
I only eat
equilateral triangles.

03:33.179 --> 03:35.880
Isosceles, isosceles,

03:35.882 --> 03:38.483
oh, scalene...

03:39.319 --> 03:41.519
You didn't see that.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.455
Oh, look.

03:44.457 --> 03:45.823
It's Bert, at the bar.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.325
We should
go say hi.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.794
Why?

03:49.796 --> 03:51.729
Because that's what you do

03:51.731 --> 03:54.632
when you see someone you know
in a public place.

03:54.634 --> 03:58.803
I have multiple restraining
orders that say otherwise.

04:00.473 --> 04:03.241
Sheldon, there's a difference
between greeting a friend

04:03.243 --> 04:05.610
and following a celebrity
into a bathroom.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.613
If the judge
couldn't explain it to me,

04:08.615 --> 04:10.815
I don't see how you will.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.552
Hi, Bert.
Hello.

04:14.554 --> 04:16.019
Oh, hey, guys.

04:16.022 --> 04:17.088
What brings you here?

04:17.089 --> 04:19.123
Oh, we're having date night.
Nice.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.524
I'm meeting someone, too.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.060
Oh, really. Anybody we know?

04:22.062 --> 04:25.096
I doubt it. I met
her on G-Harmony.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.766
That's a Web site for
geologists to find love.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.501
That's a real thing?

04:30.503 --> 04:33.604
Yeah. Their slogan is
“We're all about dating

04:33.606 --> 04:36.107
and not the carbon-14 kind”"

04:37.911 --> 04:40.211
Well, have
a lovely evening.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.080
Thanks. You, too.

04:43.149 --> 04:44.615
If you think
that's more fun than talking

04:44.617 --> 04:47.051
to Zachary Quinto through
a stall door, you're crazy.

04:50.056 --> 04:51.355
You know, we could've come
to you guys.

04:51.357 --> 04:52.890
You didn't have to bring
the baby here.

04:52.892 --> 04:54.559
Oh, it's okay. It's good
to get out of the house.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.094
And the car ride
puts her to sleep.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.629
Aw, that used to work
with Sheldon.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.999
Yeah, until someone left him
in the drugstore parking lot

05:02.001 --> 05:03.367
and he freaked out.

05:03.369 --> 05:05.036
Who forgot to crack the window?

05:05.805 --> 05:07.071
Hello!

05:07.073 --> 05:08.372
LEONARD: Hey.
PENNY: Oh,

05:08.374 --> 05:09.874
someone's been shopping
at Gucci.

05:09.876 --> 05:12.743
Yeah, I saw something for Halley
and I couldn't resist.

05:12.745 --> 05:14.579
That's so
sweet of you.

05:14.581 --> 05:18.416
Yeah, it's a crushed velvet
baby cape.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.987
Oh, no, now we have two.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.124
That must've been expensive.
Yeah, it was.

05:26.126 --> 05:29.360
But it's my father's money
and I'm mad at him.

05:30.530 --> 05:31.496
What's going on with your dad?

05:31.498 --> 05:32.697
And if you really want
to hurt him,

05:32.699 --> 05:34.432
I look great in Chanel.
(clears throat)

05:34.434 --> 05:38.069
It turns out he doesn't care
if I'm married or if I'm single.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.904
He's basically given up on me.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.973
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.876
It is. He stopped trying to find
Indian girls for me to marry.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.111
All you did was complain
when he did that.

05:47.113 --> 05:50.081
Leonard, he's hurting.
Let him feel how he feels.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.883
Thank you, Penny.
Yeah.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.018
Shoes, I'm a seven-and-a-half;
boots, I'm an eight.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.056
...MSN Search,

05:59.058 --> 06:01.058
AltaVista,

06:01.060 --> 06:04.061
and... Ask Jeeves.

06:04.063 --> 06:05.396
You?

06:05.398 --> 06:06.998
Sorry, I don't have a list

06:07.000 --> 06:09.667
of defunct search engines
that I miss.

06:11.604 --> 06:13.437
Hey. Looks like I got stood up,

06:13.439 --> 06:14.972
so I'm gonna head out.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.474
Oh, no. Are you sure
you don't want to give her

06:16.476 --> 06:17.542
a few more minutes?

06:17.544 --> 06:20.645
Nah, G-Harmony recommends
after two hours,

06:20.647 --> 06:23.681
it's time to cut bait.

06:25.585 --> 06:26.517
I'm so sorry.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.253
Bert, I insist
that you join us.

06:29.255 --> 06:31.122
You really wouldn't mind?

06:31.124 --> 06:32.690
Not at all. Amy?

06:32.692 --> 06:33.958
Fine with me.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.460
Thanks. I'll go grab a chair.

06:36.462 --> 06:39.664
Sheldon, that was so sweet
of you.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.866
Well, I could deduce
by his facial expression

06:41.868 --> 06:44.068
and body language
that he was sad.

06:44.070 --> 06:48.339
So the part where he got
stood up didn't clue you in?

06:48.341 --> 06:53.344
You want me to look at him
<i>and</i> listen to him?

06:54.547 --> 06:57.715
My father thinks the reason
I can't make a relationship work

06:57.717 --> 06:59.383
is because I'm spoiled.

07:04.490 --> 07:08.059
I'm sorry, is he waiting
for someone to disagree?

07:08.061 --> 07:09.994
Just because he helps me out

07:09.996 --> 07:12.730
doesn't automatically mean
that I'm spoiled.

07:12.732 --> 07:14.452
All right, how much exactly
does he pay for?

07:16.035 --> 07:18.035
Okay,
I'll tell you,

07:18.037 --> 07:19.503
but please don't judge me.

07:19.505 --> 07:23.474
He pays for my car, my rent,
and my credit cards.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.579
I'm trying, but I'm judging.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.083
Maybe your dad's right.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.418
Yeah, women do like a man
that can support himself.

07:34.420 --> 07:36.020
But Bernadette makes
more money than Howard.

07:36.022 --> 07:39.156
She basically
supports him.

07:39.158 --> 07:41.759
Yeah, maybe your
dad's right.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.531
Good question. Let's see.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.400
Infoseek,

07:49.402 --> 07:51.269
WebCrawler,

07:51.271 --> 07:53.170
oh, HotBot.

07:53.172 --> 07:55.906
Okay, literally
any other topic.

07:56.676 --> 07:59.844
All right.
How did you guys meet?

07:59.846 --> 08:02.013
Actually, we met online.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.015
Our-our first date
was at a coffee shop.

08:04.017 --> 08:07.084
Although, unlike your date,
she actually showed up.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.454
Oh, he looks sad again.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.358
Well, I really envy
your relationship.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.927
Other than you two only
having sex once a year,

08:16.929 --> 08:19.530
you're the perfect couple.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.967
You-you know about that?

08:22.969 --> 08:26.170
Uh, yeah, everyone at
the university does.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.306
Were you aware of this?

08:28.308 --> 08:32.342
No. No, I only told Leonard,
Howard, Raj,

08:32.345 --> 08:35.613
Kripke, uh, Professor Wu,
Professor Klein,

08:35.615 --> 08:38.582
and a lunch lady
in the cafeteria.

08:38.583 --> 08:42.019
How everyone else found out
is a mystery to me.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:52.563 --> 08:54.630
Why aren't you
talking to me?

08:54.632 --> 08:56.632
- Because I'm mad at you.
- Oh.

08:56.634 --> 08:59.935
Well, now I'm sorry I asked.

08:59.937 --> 09:01.870
Sheldon, it's humiliating.

09:01.872 --> 09:05.040
Thanks to you, my colleagues are
gossiping about our sex life.

09:05.042 --> 09:06.542
What is there to gossip about?

09:06.544 --> 09:08.877
We barely have one.

09:09.714 --> 09:12.414
That's why they're doing it!

09:15.619 --> 09:19.455
Is it safe to assume
you're not speaking to me again?

09:20.725 --> 09:23.392
If you're not answering because
you're not speaking to me,

09:23.394 --> 09:25.294
perhaps we could come up
with a signal!

09:25.296 --> 09:27.496
(door slams)

09:30.267 --> 09:31.967
That works!

09:34.505 --> 09:36.004
You don't need your dad's money.

09:36.006 --> 09:38.307
You can get by on your salary.
LEONARD: Yeah.

09:38.309 --> 09:40.476
Well, we work at the
same place as you, and

09:40.478 --> 09:42.077
we've always been fine.
KOOTHRAPPALI: Oh, please.

09:42.079 --> 09:45.414
Look in the mirror. You both
look ten years older than I do.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.016
PENNY:
All right.

09:48.018 --> 09:49.351
Hang on. We can
figure this out.

09:49.353 --> 09:52.020
Let's just go over your
expenses. How much is your rent?

09:52.022 --> 09:53.856
I don't want to say.

09:53.858 --> 09:56.058
Is it really
that high?

09:56.060 --> 09:59.361
I don't want to say because
I don't know how much it is.

09:59.363 --> 10:01.663
You don't how much
your rent is?

10:01.665 --> 10:03.557
My father pays for it! Do you
know how much your rent is?!

10:03.581 --> 10:04.534
Yeah.

10:04.535 --> 10:05.834
Well, then double it,

10:05.836 --> 10:07.870
because my building's
a lot nicer than this dump.

10:09.006 --> 10:12.007
Do you know how
much your car costs?

10:12.009 --> 10:13.075
Not really.

10:13.077 --> 10:15.110
Well, how much
do you spend on food?

10:15.112 --> 10:18.147
The housekeeper
does the shopping.

10:18.983 --> 10:21.717
Oh, my God, you
really are spoiled.

10:21.719 --> 10:23.018
<i>I'm</i> spoiled?!

10:23.020 --> 10:26.722
Your baby has a cape
that costs $300!

10:32.329 --> 10:33.428
I'm going to bed.

10:33.430 --> 10:34.930
Well, wait.

10:34.932 --> 10:38.767
This is our first fight as
a couple who live together.

10:38.769 --> 10:40.035
So?

10:40.037 --> 10:42.304
I'm not sure of the protocol.

10:42.306 --> 10:43.605
Television teaches us

10:43.607 --> 10:45.207
that the man's supposed
to sleep on the couch,

10:45.209 --> 10:48.844
but of the two of us,
you're clearly more sofa-sized.

10:48.846 --> 10:50.712
I'm not sleeping on the couch

10:50.714 --> 10:53.115
'cause you don't know
what's private and what's not.

10:53.117 --> 10:55.150
This isn't fair.

10:55.152 --> 10:56.518
You've discussed aspects

10:56.520 --> 10:58.353
of our physical relationship
with Penny.

10:58.355 --> 10:59.788
That's different!

10:59.790 --> 11:02.357
She's a close friend,
not the lady in the cafeteria

11:02.359 --> 11:05.194
who cuts the crust off
your sandwiches!

11:05.196 --> 11:06.795
That lady has a name.

11:06.797 --> 11:08.330
I don't know what it is,

11:08.332 --> 11:10.732
but one time,
I accidentally called her “Mom”.

11:13.971 --> 11:16.371
Sounds like you're gonna
need a cheaper place to live.

11:16.373 --> 11:18.540
When you moved here,
you didn't have a lot of money.

11:18.542 --> 11:19.608
How'd you get by?

11:19.610 --> 11:21.743
Well, sometimes
you can get free food

11:21.745 --> 11:24.613
and Wi-Fi from the neighbors.

11:24.615 --> 11:26.081
Just know

11:26.083 --> 11:29.151
you might have
to marry one of 'em.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.720
Hey, you guys let Stuart
live with you.

11:31.722 --> 11:32.888
Why not Raj, too?

11:32.890 --> 11:35.557
What-what are you doing? I...

11:37.094 --> 11:40.162
I-I-I schlepped the baby over,
I brought imported beer.

11:40.164 --> 11:42.064
Why don't you like me?

11:42.066 --> 11:43.165
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Well,

11:43.167 --> 11:44.486
I thought
we were best friends!

11:44.510 --> 11:45.501
We are!

11:45.502 --> 11:49.037
That's why I'm sad my best
friend's gonna be homeless.

11:51.175 --> 11:54.276
I'm sorry, Raj. We really
just don't have the space.

11:54.278 --> 11:55.677
What if he lives in your garage?

11:55.679 --> 11:58.013
What if you stop helping?!

11:59.383 --> 12:02.217
Guys, I'm not living
in a garage!

12:02.219 --> 12:04.353
Wait. Why are we talking
about our place

12:04.355 --> 12:08.123
when Sheldon's old room is
sitting there perfectly empty?

12:10.261 --> 12:12.027
That's a great idea.

12:12.029 --> 12:14.463
Raj,

12:14.465 --> 12:17.699
if you need a place to stay,
of course you are welcome here.

12:17.701 --> 12:21.870
Thank you, but if I'm gonna just
take advantage of my friends,

12:21.872 --> 12:24.706
I might as well keep on
relying on my father.

12:24.708 --> 12:26.108
Okay, only if you're sure.

12:26.110 --> 12:27.476
(quietly):
Whew.

12:27.478 --> 12:29.878
Yeah.

12:30.981 --> 12:32.981
(knocking)
SHELDON: Amy?

12:32.983 --> 12:34.249
(knocking)
Amy?

12:34.251 --> 12:36.585
(knocking) Amy?
Yeah?

12:37.621 --> 12:40.389
Not exactly the welcome wagon,
but I'll take it.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.459
What is this?

12:44.461 --> 12:47.296
I'm mapping basic topics
of conversation

12:47.298 --> 12:49.998
and with whom
they can be discussed.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.369
I call these circles
“Zones of Privacy”"

12:54.371 --> 12:55.637
Don't Google that

12:55.639 --> 12:58.106
unless you want to see pictures
of people's genitals.

12:58.108 --> 13:01.843
This circle contains
only me and you.

13:01.845 --> 13:04.713
It represents subjects we
only share with each other...

13:04.715 --> 13:08.550
details of physical intimacy,
bathroom habits.

13:08.552 --> 13:10.385
Although, as I'm saying it,

13:10.387 --> 13:14.289
I may need
to add Dr. Fink in here.

13:14.291 --> 13:15.691
Are you really worried

13:15.693 --> 13:18.026
about revealing secrets
to Stephen Hawking?

13:18.028 --> 13:22.664
No, I was just excited
to list him as a friend.

13:22.666 --> 13:25.901
Well, I do appreciate
you working on this.

13:27.671 --> 13:29.571
I'm sorry you were embarrassed.

13:29.573 --> 13:31.440
And now I understand that

13:31.442 --> 13:33.775
some things are just
between you and me,

13:33.777 --> 13:38.280
and in the event of redness
and swelling, Dr. Fink.

13:40.584 --> 13:42.384
What's that little dot
in the middle?

13:42.386 --> 13:45.620
That's reserved for thoughts
I don't share with anyone.

13:45.622 --> 13:49.925
Interesting. You really
have secrets you don't tell me?

13:49.927 --> 13:51.493
Of course.

13:51.495 --> 13:53.195
Can I hear one?

13:53.197 --> 13:55.230
No, they're private.

13:55.232 --> 13:59.134
Why? Are they naughty?

13:59.970 --> 14:02.170
A little.

14:02.172 --> 14:03.839
Please?

14:03.841 --> 14:06.041
Fine.

14:07.211 --> 14:09.378
Two years ago...

14:10.581 --> 14:13.281
...I got my driver's license.

14:14.118 --> 14:16.551
What?!

14:17.821 --> 14:19.821
Why didn't
you say anything?!

14:19.823 --> 14:23.225
I like being
chauffeured around.

14:23.227 --> 14:25.827
It makes me feel important.

14:27.464 --> 14:30.532
So when I got up at 4:00 a.m.
to drive you across the desert

14:30.534 --> 14:33.468
to an antique train museum,
I didn't have to?

14:33.470 --> 14:34.736
No, you didn't.

14:34.738 --> 14:36.538
But keep in mind,

14:36.540 --> 14:39.708
I felt extremely important.

14:42.012 --> 14:44.212
(line ringing)

14:44.214 --> 14:45.514
(beep)

14:45.516 --> 14:48.016
What?!

14:48.018 --> 14:49.251
Hello, Father.

14:49.253 --> 14:50.519
We need to talk.

14:50.521 --> 14:51.920
All right.

14:51.922 --> 14:53.655
I have come
to an important decision.

14:53.657 --> 14:55.490
I will not be accepting
your money anymore.

14:55.492 --> 14:58.226
I'm a man,
and I can take care of myself.

14:58.228 --> 14:59.895
That's wonderful!

14:59.897 --> 15:01.196
Yes, that is wonderful!

15:01.198 --> 15:03.398
You will no longer be able
to accuse me of being spoiled!

15:03.400 --> 15:05.300
I am so proud of you.

15:05.302 --> 15:06.535
Dad, I'm trying to tell you off,

15:06.537 --> 15:09.438
and you're ruining it
with your delight and relief.

15:10.841 --> 15:12.274
Sorry.

15:12.276 --> 15:15.410
Oh, no, my grown son is going
to stop spending all my money.

15:15.412 --> 15:18.346
Where did I fail as a father?!

15:18.348 --> 15:20.382
Yeah, that's right.

15:20.384 --> 15:21.917
Keep asking yourself that!

15:23.153 --> 15:26.688
But I still love you very much,
so don't cut me out of the will.

15:35.163 --> 15:36.596
Oh, you brought
your own lunch.

15:36.598 --> 15:37.764
Good for you.

15:37.766 --> 15:39.899
Yeah, I'm making a bunch
of changes.

15:39.901 --> 15:42.068
This morning,
I fired my dog walker.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.471
Oh. How's the dog gonna go
to the bathroom?

15:44.473 --> 15:46.039
Uh, I gave her an Imodium.

15:46.041 --> 15:47.807
That's tomorrow's problem.

15:49.578 --> 15:52.712
Excuse me. May I have
your attention, please?

15:52.714 --> 15:54.247
I have recently

15:54.249 --> 15:57.017
been made aware
that my personal relationship

15:57.019 --> 16:00.220
with Amy Farrah Fowler has
become water cooler gossip.

16:00.222 --> 16:04.124
And I just want to say,
shame on all of you.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.793
We're scientists.

16:06.795 --> 16:08.061
Our minds should be focused

16:08.063 --> 16:10.530
on the advancement
of human knowledge,

16:10.532 --> 16:13.033
not the intimate details
of other people's lives.

16:13.035 --> 16:15.568
He's right.

16:15.570 --> 16:18.138
And I'm sorry for the part
I played in this.

16:18.140 --> 16:19.839
Thank you, Bert.

16:19.841 --> 16:22.942
You're a good man. That
woman who stood you up

16:22.944 --> 16:25.512
and humiliated you last
night really missed out.

16:26.915 --> 16:30.183
That doesn't paint me
in the best light.

16:30.185 --> 16:32.285
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

16:32.287 --> 16:37.390
Correction: That woman not only
had vigorous coitus with Bert...

16:37.392 --> 16:41.528
she also tipped him a
dollar for a job well done.

16:44.266 --> 16:46.700
- That better?
- Not really.

16:48.303 --> 16:51.338
All right, well, to sum up...
focus on science,

16:51.340 --> 16:53.573
keep your nose out
of other people's business,

16:53.575 --> 16:56.343
and, uh, whoa,
for a good time, call Bert.

17:03.518 --> 17:05.551
What brought that on?

17:05.554 --> 17:07.954
(sighs)
Well, last night Amy was angry

17:07.955 --> 17:10.457
with me because I'd been
foolishly telling people

17:10.459 --> 17:12.325
about certain personal matters.

17:12.327 --> 17:14.094
That's understandable.

17:14.096 --> 17:15.561
Oh, I know that now.

17:15.564 --> 17:17.430
At first, I thought
she was cranky

17:17.432 --> 17:19.898
because of her horrific
menstrual cramps, but...

17:20.868 --> 17:23.569
...it turns out, no, she
was genuinely mortified.
