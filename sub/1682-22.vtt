WEBVTT

00:01.217 --> 00:03.551
Guess what I've got
behind my back.

00:03.552 --> 00:06.121
Wait, wait, wait,
I got this one. Left.

00:06.122 --> 00:08.323
Wrong game. But correct.

00:08.324 --> 00:12.793
<i>Five front-row tickets
to Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>

00:12.794 --> 00:14.194
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers?</i>

00:14.195 --> 00:15.362
That is awesome!

00:15.363 --> 00:16.998
<i>You've heard of
Robots vs. Wrestlers?</i>

00:16.999 --> 00:19.466
Never. But we assume it's
some sort of sporting event

00:19.467 --> 00:21.636
That pits robots
against wrestlers!

00:21.637 --> 00:22.970
That's exactly what it is,

00:22.971 --> 00:24.404
According to the Web site!

00:24.405 --> 00:25.940
(excited shouting)

00:25.941 --> 00:27.842
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:27.843 --> 00:30.143
Who's the fifth ticket for?

00:30.144 --> 00:32.145
Uh... Robin.

00:32.146 --> 00:33.146
I know--

00:33.147 --> 00:34.648
She moved in with her boyfriend

00:34.649 --> 00:36.950
And said she doesn't want
to hang out with us anymore,

00:36.951 --> 00:39.185
<i>But this is Robots
vs. Wrestlers.</i>

00:39.186 --> 00:41.420
<i>Robots...</i>

00:41.421 --> 00:42.789
<i>Vs. Wrestlers!</i>

00:42.790 --> 00:44.124
Barney is right.

00:44.125 --> 00:46.324
It's impossible
to say no to that.

00:46.325 --> 00:47.325
No to that.

00:47.326 --> 00:48.694
I wish I could, but I

00:48.695 --> 00:50.195
Have plans with don on Saturday.

00:50.196 --> 00:51.429
He's making me Chinese.

00:51.430 --> 00:53.098
I'll assume you're
talking about food,

00:53.099 --> 00:55.467
Otherwise, I have some
follow-up questions.

00:55.468 --> 00:56.702
Oh, I'm sorry, Lily,

00:56.703 --> 00:59.004
But I got to give this thing
with don a chance.

00:59.005 --> 01:01.505
And I can't do that if I'm out
drinking with you guys

01:01.506 --> 01:03.307
Every single night--
especially when "you guys"

01:03.308 --> 01:05.209
Includes two
of my ex-boyfriends.

01:05.209 --> 01:06.944
I understand.
You're right.

01:06.945 --> 01:09.714
It's just we
all really miss you.

01:09.715 --> 01:11.215
Aw, I miss you, too.

01:11.216 --> 01:13.317
Oh, listen, I got to go.
Talk soon?

01:13.318 --> 01:14.618
Okay, bye.

01:14.619 --> 01:17.387
Sorry, New York,
I had to take that.

01:17.388 --> 01:18.755
Now, where were we?

01:18.756 --> 01:21.658
Yeah. Yes. Bus crash.

01:21.659 --> 01:23.326
She said no?

01:23.327 --> 01:25.095
How could she say no?

01:25.096 --> 01:27.397
<i>Robots vs. Wrestlers
is our most important tradition</i>

01:27.398 --> 01:28.799
As a group.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.234
Tradition? We've never
done this before?

01:31.235 --> 01:33.268
<i>It's Robots vs. Wrestlers, Lily.</i>

01:33.269 --> 01:35.738
How is that not
gonna be a tradition?

01:35.739 --> 01:36.739
Barney:
Well...

01:36.740 --> 01:38.273
This is how it starts.

01:38.274 --> 01:40.542
(voice quivering):
First Robin moves in with don,

01:40.543 --> 01:42.477
Then Marshall and Lily
have a baby,

01:42.478 --> 01:43.545
Then Ted...

01:43.546 --> 01:44.546
Gets married?

01:44.547 --> 01:46.481
I was gonna say,
"is found alone

01:46.482 --> 01:48.450
In his apartment
devoured by his cats,"

01:48.451 --> 01:50.018
But either way, not pretty.

01:50.019 --> 01:51.019
Everyone's

01:51.020 --> 01:52.954
Leaving me,
and I don't like it!

01:52.955 --> 01:54.889
Oh, Barney, you
don't have to worry

01:54.890 --> 01:56.524
About Marshall
and me having kids.

01:56.525 --> 01:58.593
<i>That's a long way
down the road.</i>

01:58.594 --> 02:00.228
Exactly-- it's,
uh, down the road,

02:00.229 --> 02:01.429
A medium way.

02:01.430 --> 02:03.331
A medium-long way.

02:03.332 --> 02:04.932
I mean, you can see it ahead.

02:04.933 --> 02:07.201
In the vast, vast distance.

02:07.202 --> 02:08.869
But you're already seeing
exit signs for it.

02:08.870 --> 02:10.237
Really? I didn't see any.

02:10.238 --> 02:13.173
You might want to get
in the right lane.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.908
I understand
how you feel, Barney.

02:14.909 --> 02:16.777
Friendships are important.

02:16.778 --> 02:18.779
In fact, Emerson wrote

02:18.780 --> 02:21.180
A great poem entitled
"friendship."

02:21.181 --> 02:23.015
You guys are gonna love this.

02:23.016 --> 02:26.853
"a ruddy drop of manly blood,
the surging sea outweighs..."

02:26.854 --> 02:28.687
(Barney makes a raspberry)
(laughter)

02:28.688 --> 02:31.523
<i>Narrator: That's how it had
always been for me with the gang</i>

02:31.524 --> 02:33.860
<i>Any time I tried to get
a little high-minded.</i>

02:33.861 --> 02:36.462
You guys, you've got
to try this syrah.

02:36.463 --> 02:39.231
Hints of creme de cassis,
red berries,

02:39.232 --> 02:40.732
Toasty oak...

02:40.733 --> 02:42.901
(raspberry) (laughter)

02:43.903 --> 02:45.103
Hmm.

02:45.104 --> 02:48.673
Five letters, blank baritone.

02:48.674 --> 02:50.942
Of course! Lyric baritone!

02:50.943 --> 02:53.778
Which is actually higher
than a dramatic baritone.

02:53.779 --> 02:55.212
You know, there's
a telling moment

02:55.213 --> 02:56.914
<i>In the second act
of la bohème...</i>

02:56.915 --> 02:59.316
(raspberry) (Marshall laughing)

02:59.317 --> 03:01.285
Guys, come on, I'm
just trying to add

03:01.286 --> 03:02.753
A little class to
these proceedings.

03:02.754 --> 03:04.054
It's like that line

03:04.055 --> 03:05.222
<i>From Dante's inferno.</i>

03:05.223 --> 03:06.824
(raspberry) (laughter)

03:06.825 --> 03:08.025
"consider your origins:

03:08.026 --> 03:10.226
You were not born
to live like brutes."

03:10.227 --> 03:11.895
(raspberry, laughing)

03:11.896 --> 03:14.230
"but to follow virtue
and knowledge""

03:14.231 --> 03:16.266
(raspberry, laughter) Ted: Or...

03:16.267 --> 03:17.901
In the original Italian...

03:17.902 --> 03:19.602
(others groaning)

03:19.603 --> 03:22.272
(speaking Italian)

03:22.273 --> 03:25.307
(repeated raspberries)

03:25.308 --> 03:35.643
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:38.254 --> 03:39.254
You guys are right.

03:39.255 --> 03:40.722
I'm totally overreacting

03:40.723 --> 03:42.323
To this whole Robin thing.

03:42.324 --> 03:44.325
What's this envelope?
Is this a wedding invitation?

03:44.326 --> 03:46.160
Robin's marrying don.
I'm gonna die alone!

03:46.161 --> 03:48.129
Ted's gonna get eaten by cats!

03:48.130 --> 03:49.130
Ted:
Dude,

03:49.131 --> 03:51.132
Relax-- it's for Marissa Heller.

03:51.133 --> 03:53.067
Marissa Heller?
She sounds hot.

03:53.802 --> 03:55.002
Face, boobs, describe.

03:55.003 --> 03:56.103
Start with boobs.

03:56.104 --> 03:58.271
<i>Who was Marissa Heller?</i>

03:58.272 --> 04:00.207
<i>That mystery began
when Marshall and I</i>

04:00.208 --> 04:01.541
<i>First moved in together.</i>

04:01.542 --> 04:04.377
Ted! We got our
first mail delivery!

04:04.378 --> 04:06.079
We are popular.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.347
We've got

04:07.348 --> 04:09.082
A golf magazine for...

04:09.083 --> 04:10.383
Marissa Heller,

04:10.384 --> 04:12.652
We've got a wicker
furniture catalog,

04:12.653 --> 04:14.053
Also for Marissa Heller,

04:14.054 --> 04:15.487
And...

04:15.488 --> 04:17.990
A coupon for a bird store...

04:17.991 --> 04:20.993
Addressed to Marissa Heller or--
stay with me--

04:20.994 --> 04:22.794
"current occupant."

04:22.795 --> 04:23.996
That's us!

04:23.997 --> 04:26.031
We've got mail!
Fantastic!

04:26.032 --> 04:27.466
Marissa Heller?

04:27.467 --> 04:29.367
She must be the woman
who lived here before us.

04:29.368 --> 04:31.736
I wonder what she was like.

04:31.737 --> 04:33.171
<i>And just like that,</i>

04:33.172 --> 04:36.540
<i>A picture began
to take shape...</i>

04:36.541 --> 04:39.610
<i>A picture of Marissa Heller,
the golfer...</i>

04:42.882 --> 04:46.750
<i>...Marissa Heller,
the wicker catalog shopper...</i>

04:46.751 --> 04:49.552
<i>Marissa Heller,
the bird owner.</i>

04:51.089 --> 04:53.690
And since then, with each
piece of mail we've gotten,

04:53.691 --> 04:55.392
The picture's become
a little clearer.

04:55.393 --> 04:56.493
The only thing

04:56.494 --> 04:58.362
We don't know is
what she looks like.

04:58.363 --> 04:59.963
Well, I guess
I'll forward this along

04:59.964 --> 05:00.997
Like I've been forwarding...

05:00.998 --> 05:03.432
Oh, just open it.
Okay.

05:04.667 --> 05:07.336
It's an invitation
to Jefferson van Smoot's

05:07.337 --> 05:10.106
Annual spring social
this Saturday night...

05:10.107 --> 05:11.941
In the penthouse apartment
of the Alberta!

05:11.942 --> 05:14.310
You guys... That's the most
beautiful building in Manhattan!

05:14.311 --> 05:16.345
We-we got to go
to this party.

05:16.346 --> 05:18.613
That depends-- does it say
anything on that invitation

05:18.614 --> 05:21.716
About robots battling wrestlers
for intergalactic supremacy?

05:21.717 --> 05:23.251
No, but it says open bar.

05:23.252 --> 05:25.520
Revised agenda
for Saturday night:

05:25.521 --> 05:27.422
Free booze
at Marissa Heller's party,

05:27.423 --> 05:28.957
<i>Then Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>

05:28.958 --> 05:30.025
One of us just

05:30.026 --> 05:33.727
Needs to pretend
to be Marissa Heller.

05:35.964 --> 05:37.031
(chuckles) guys, I'm flattered,

05:37.032 --> 05:38.999
But I think Lily should do it.

05:40.035 --> 05:41.936
<i>So the big night arrived.</i>

05:41.937 --> 05:43.870
<i>Our first stop...</i>

05:43.871 --> 05:45.806
<i>The Alberta building.</i>

05:45.807 --> 05:47.808
Wow! This building is amazing!

05:47.809 --> 05:49.708
Did you guys see
the Porte Cochere

05:49.709 --> 05:51.044
And the Terra-cotta
spandrels outside?

05:51.045 --> 05:52.211
Oh, my God, look!

05:52.212 --> 05:54.080
I just got a text from Robin.

05:54.081 --> 05:55.148
It says...

05:55.149 --> 05:57.050
(raspberry, laughter)

05:57.051 --> 05:58.784
Okay, guys, huddle up.

05:58.785 --> 06:01.287
Now, Lil, you can do
this-- all you have to do

06:01.288 --> 06:03.756
Is look that guy in the eye,
say your name

06:03.757 --> 06:05.490
Is Marissa Heller,
and we are golden.

06:05.491 --> 06:07.492
And again, just so
we're clear, no accent.

06:07.493 --> 06:10.162
(cockney accent): Are we sure
she's not British, isn't it?

06:10.163 --> 06:11.463
No! No!
No!

06:11.464 --> 06:13.098
All right! Here I go.

06:13.099 --> 06:14.566
I'm doing it.

06:14.567 --> 06:15.733
Hi.
Hello.

06:15.734 --> 06:16.801
Ooh. Sorry.

06:16.802 --> 06:17.936
Go ahead.

06:17.937 --> 06:20.072
I'm here for
the van Smoot party.

06:20.073 --> 06:22.673
My name is Marissa Heller.

06:23.908 --> 06:25.977
(quietly):
Bollocks.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.955
So that's Marissa Heller.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.323
Huh.

06:33.324 --> 06:35.025
<i>She fine.</i>

06:36.027 --> 06:37.560
Her teeth look really nice.

06:37.561 --> 06:39.628
She must be remembering
to go to the dentist

06:39.629 --> 06:41.263
Even without those
reminder postcards.

06:41.264 --> 06:42.699
So, what are we doing?

06:42.700 --> 06:46.302
I'm getting us into
the party, that's what!

06:46.303 --> 06:47.904
Marissa Heller!

06:47.905 --> 06:49.238
Barney Stinson!

06:49.239 --> 06:51.140
We met at that gathering for...

06:51.141 --> 06:52.708
Bird owners.

06:52.709 --> 06:54.275
I don't think so.

06:54.276 --> 06:55.276
Wicker lovers?

06:55.277 --> 06:57.112
No.
Stinson out.

06:57.113 --> 06:59.380
Guys, it's not gonna happen.

06:59.381 --> 07:00.782
I got this.

07:03.519 --> 07:06.121
You know, this elevator
still uses the same mechanism

07:06.122 --> 07:08.556
From when it was first
installed in 1906.

07:08.557 --> 07:09.556
Rumor is,

07:09.557 --> 07:10.825
Louis Lamar Skolnick,

07:10.826 --> 07:12.593
The architect who
designed this building,

07:12.594 --> 07:14.161
Carved these panels himself.

07:14.162 --> 07:15.730
Oh, a Skolnick fan?

07:15.731 --> 07:16.997
Well...
I love

07:16.998 --> 07:18.199
His juxtaposition between

07:18.200 --> 07:20.067
The north German
renaissance exterior...

07:20.068 --> 07:22.970
And the decidedly French
influence on the inside! I know!

07:22.971 --> 07:23.971
He was an architect

07:23.972 --> 07:26.272
With the soul of a poet, really.

07:26.273 --> 07:27.907
No, no, no, don't, don't.

07:27.908 --> 07:29.408
It's working.
Ted: You know,

07:29.409 --> 07:30.476
I have a confession to make.

07:30.477 --> 07:32.045
We're not on the guest list,

07:32.046 --> 07:35.381
But... I've always wanted to see
the inside of the Alberta.

07:36.350 --> 07:37.751
Well, then right this way.

07:37.752 --> 07:40.153
We're all together.

07:42.122 --> 07:44.289
Told you I'd get us in.

07:46.126 --> 07:48.026
So...

07:48.027 --> 07:50.995
<i>Anyone been watching
the young and the restless?</i>

07:53.031 --> 07:54.165
(gasps) awesome!

07:54.166 --> 07:56.635
<i>Who ordered
soap opera illustrated?</i>

07:56.636 --> 08:00.705
Huh. Marissa Heller,
I like your style.

08:02.575 --> 08:05.310
Anyone?

08:05.311 --> 08:08.211
Am I to understand
that there isn't

08:08.212 --> 08:12.283
A single soap opera fan
in this entire elevator, Hmm?

08:12.284 --> 08:14.017
I don't own a TV.

08:14.018 --> 08:15.886
The only operas I watch

08:15.887 --> 08:18.689
Are at the met.

08:23.260 --> 08:25.795
(whispers):
Dibs.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.797
(chamber music playing quietly)

08:27.798 --> 08:29.198
Ah. Excuse me.

08:29.199 --> 08:31.267
Jefferson, darling.

08:36.173 --> 08:38.873
Wow, I am not dressed for this.

08:38.874 --> 08:40.708
One word, made up:

08:40.710 --> 08:42.544
"douche-pocalypse""

08:42.544 --> 08:44.979
Guys... That's
Peter Bogdanovich

08:44.980 --> 08:47.349
Talking to Arianna Huffington
and Will Shortz,

08:47.350 --> 08:49.484
Editor of the new
York times crossword!

08:49.485 --> 08:51.486
Look, let's give
this party a chance, okay?

08:51.487 --> 08:52.754
There's free food, free booze.

08:52.755 --> 08:55.823
20 minutes, then we can leave.

08:55.824 --> 08:57.692
But, you see,
music was changing,

08:57.693 --> 09:00.127
And Giovanni Artusi
simply didn't understand

09:00.128 --> 09:02.496
The new style of composing.

09:02.497 --> 09:04.965
Excuse me, are you
talking about Monteverdi

09:04.966 --> 09:06.867
<i>And his fourth book
of madrigals?</i>

09:06.868 --> 09:08.502
My dear chap, what else?

09:08.503 --> 09:11.738
That's my favorite
book of madrigals!

09:12.506 --> 09:14.341
Smoked Foie gras

09:14.342 --> 09:17.344
With caramelized mango
and crème fraîche?

09:17.345 --> 09:18.778
Hey, uh, hey, guy,

09:18.779 --> 09:21.080
Do you have anything in the
mini cheeseburger department?

09:21.081 --> 09:23.850
I don't think so, sir.

09:23.851 --> 09:25.852
No? Mini pizzas?
Little cups of fries?

09:25.853 --> 09:28.721
Any food at all that'll
make me feel like a giant?

09:28.722 --> 09:30.789
I'll check, sir.

09:32.692 --> 09:36.061
He's not gonna check.

09:36.062 --> 09:37.529
I'm performing
open-heart surgery

09:37.530 --> 09:39.665
On the dutch ambassador
in the morning.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.633
I hope he pulls through.

09:41.634 --> 09:44.535
Really? A colleague of mine
just prescribed cumadin

09:44.536 --> 09:46.036
To the dutch ambassador.

09:46.037 --> 09:47.071
And there's no way

09:47.072 --> 09:48.606
<i>She'd be on anticoagulants</i>

09:48.607 --> 09:51.075
<i>If she were about
to undergo surgery.</i>

09:52.678 --> 09:54.111
Just...

09:54.112 --> 09:55.312
Okay?

09:56.348 --> 09:58.382
You know who published
a great article

09:58.383 --> 10:00.550
On Walt Whitman
and the politics of semantics?

10:00.551 --> 10:02.252
Professor Hammersmith of Oxford.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.388
<i>I am Professor Hammersmith.</i>

10:04.389 --> 10:06.757
Wha...?!

10:06.758 --> 10:09.058
...Which is exactly what
truffaut was talking about

10:09.059 --> 10:12.662
<i>In his 1954 article
in Cahiers Du Cinéma.</i>

10:12.663 --> 10:15.964
Film is an auteur's
medium, full stop.

10:15.965 --> 10:17.433
(laughing)

10:17.434 --> 10:18.734
Movies...

10:18.735 --> 10:20.068
Right?

10:20.069 --> 10:21.537
Actors.

10:22.572 --> 10:25.073
Willem Dafoe.

10:25.074 --> 10:26.975
Funny thing
about Willem Dafoe--

10:26.976 --> 10:30.779
Uh, his name kind of
sounds like a frog...

10:30.780 --> 10:33.180
Talking to a parrot.

10:33.181 --> 10:34.582
(deeply):
Willem.

10:34.583 --> 10:36.418
(high-pitched):
Defoe!

10:36.419 --> 10:37.585
(deeply):
Willem.

10:37.586 --> 10:39.788
(high-pitched):
Defoe!

10:40.656 --> 10:41.790
No?

10:43.091 --> 10:44.859
As undersecretary
of the treasury,

10:44.860 --> 10:47.761
I had a big hand in crafting
that legislation.

10:47.762 --> 10:49.596
Now... I wonder

10:49.597 --> 10:51.965
If you'd like to join me
in the map room

10:51.966 --> 10:55.268
<i>And give my package
some stimulus.</i>

10:55.269 --> 10:56.770
I'm afraid not, darling.

10:56.771 --> 10:59.139
You are too old for my taste.

11:00.842 --> 11:03.208
Okay, Zsa Zsa Gabor is still
looking pretty hot,

11:03.209 --> 11:04.444
But otherwise,

11:04.445 --> 11:05.611
This party sucks.

11:05.612 --> 11:07.079
Yeah, well, we
gave it a chance.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.948
It's been 20 minutes.
Let's get out of here.

11:08.949 --> 11:10.182
Where's Ted?
Yeah.

11:10.183 --> 11:12.485
I know how to find him.

11:13.454 --> 11:15.321
Just give me one...
Mm.

11:15.322 --> 11:17.222
(clears throat)

11:18.925 --> 11:20.992
(bangs gong loudly)

11:21.727 --> 11:22.928
Gongs, right?

11:22.929 --> 11:24.729
Uh, louder than you think.

11:24.730 --> 11:29.067
Young man, that gong
is a 500-year-old relic

11:29.068 --> 11:32.871
That hasn't been struck
since W.S. Gilbert hit it

11:32.872 --> 11:36.373
<i>At the London premiere
of the Mikado in 1885.</i>

11:39.374 --> 11:40.817
Wife is a 500 year relic that

11:40.827 --> 11:42.527
hasn't been struck since W.S. Gilbert  hit it

11:42.537 --> 11:44.537
at the London premiere 
of the Mikado in 1885.

11:46.518 --> 11:48.251
Guys, Will Schorz, editor 
of the Times' crossword.

11:48.252 --> 11:50.454
You know how I've been
saying they always use ulee

11:50.455 --> 11:52.021
<i>From Ulee's gold
because of the vowels?</i>

11:52.022 --> 11:53.356
Well, tell 'em,
will. Tell 'em.

11:53.357 --> 11:54.524
It's because of the vowels.

11:54.525 --> 11:55.758
It's because of the vowels!

11:55.759 --> 11:58.227
Oh, wow. Ted, can I talk
to you just for a second?

11:58.228 --> 12:01.230
Hey, will, ten-letter-word for
diminutive egg-based torte?

12:01.231 --> 12:02.398
Mini-quiche? Where?!

12:02.399 --> 12:04.400
Right there.

12:04.401 --> 12:06.268
Such a great party. Such a

12:06.269 --> 12:08.370
Great party! Yeah, totally, Ted.
It's time to go.

12:08.371 --> 12:10.205
<i>It's Robots
vs. Wrestlers o'clock.</i>

12:10.206 --> 12:11.206
Oh.
Marissa: Ted.

12:11.207 --> 12:12.574
There you are.

12:12.575 --> 12:15.176
We'll be blind taste-testing
French whites in a bit.

12:15.177 --> 12:16.879
Should be a hoot and a half.

12:16.880 --> 12:19.615
Well, I decan't miss that.

12:19.616 --> 12:22.350
(both laughing)

12:22.351 --> 12:24.451
I know.
You don't have to say it.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.220
You don't decant white wine.

12:26.221 --> 12:29.957
Miss Lily in the living
room with the candlestick.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.192
Van Smoot:
Oh, my heavens, no!

12:32.193 --> 12:34.128
That was Edgar Allan Poe's!

12:34.129 --> 12:36.263
Sorry!

12:36.264 --> 12:38.298
Uh, guys, listen,
I'm having fun here,

12:38.299 --> 12:41.300
<i>So I think I'm gonna skip
Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>

12:41.301 --> 12:42.969
(gasps)

12:42.970 --> 12:45.906
But Ted, you've never missed
Robots vs. Wrestlers!

12:47.041 --> 12:49.643
No! No! No! No!
No! No! No!

12:49.644 --> 12:51.878
No! No! No! No! No!

12:51.879 --> 12:54.047
Ted, this isn't happening.

12:54.048 --> 12:56.314
First Robin ditches us,
and now you?

12:56.315 --> 12:59.117
And for these stuffy,
pretentious snoots?!

12:59.118 --> 13:01.286
Actually, I kind of like these
stuffy, pretentious snoots.

13:01.287 --> 13:03.956
They don't make fart noises
every time I open my mouth.

13:04.991 --> 13:06.391
Now, look, I'm going to stay.

13:06.392 --> 13:07.760
I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Marshall: Yeah.

13:07.761 --> 13:09.061
Come on, Barney.
It's just one night.

13:09.062 --> 13:10.228
It doesn't mean anything.

13:10.229 --> 13:11.729
Oh, it means everything.

13:11.730 --> 13:15.033
<i>Ted, if you don't come
to Robots vs. Wrestlers,</i>

13:15.034 --> 13:17.101
It's the end of our friendship.

13:17.102 --> 13:19.571
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

13:19.572 --> 13:24.075
Fine. Then you are out
of our gang forever.

13:24.076 --> 13:26.410
You can reapply in two years.

13:26.411 --> 13:28.679
Marshall, Lily,

13:28.680 --> 13:30.313
Let's go watch

13:30.314 --> 13:32.549
Wrestlers fight robots.

13:34.619 --> 13:36.086
So embarrassing.

13:36.087 --> 13:37.554
I forgot something.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.122
(gong chimes loudly)

13:46.518 --> 13:48.586
(orchestra plays
classical music)

13:49.921 --> 13:53.457
So Ted, where did those chums
of yours scoot off to?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.258
Oh, you know.

13:55.259 --> 13:56.593
Poetry reading.

13:56.594 --> 14:00.163
(cheering, loud music blaring)

14:00.164 --> 14:03.266
Best tradition ever!

14:03.267 --> 14:05.001
Don't humor me, Marshall.

14:05.002 --> 14:06.269
Let's face it.

14:06.270 --> 14:08.171
The gang is over.

14:08.172 --> 14:09.705
Ted's gone. Robin's gone.

14:09.706 --> 14:11.573
We might as well just go
our separate ways.

14:11.574 --> 14:13.509
God, Barney, enough
with t a abandonment issues.

14:13.510 --> 14:16.245
Ted's allowed to have a life
outside of the group.

14:16.246 --> 14:17.579
We all are.

14:17.580 --> 14:19.314
Wait a minute.

14:19.315 --> 14:21.916
Why are you saying that
all of a sudden?

14:21.917 --> 14:23.952
Oh, God, you're pregnant!

14:23.953 --> 14:25.020
No.

14:25.021 --> 14:28.389
Oh, God, you
already had the baby!

14:28.390 --> 14:30.625
It's right behind me, isn't it?

14:30.626 --> 14:31.992
No, you idiot.

14:31.993 --> 14:34.228
It's just, eventually,
we're all gonna move on.

14:34.229 --> 14:36.631
It's called growing up.

14:36.632 --> 14:37.931
(loud cheering)

14:37.932 --> 14:39.900
Is that all you got, bitch?

14:39.901 --> 14:41.335
But can you at least promise me

14:41.336 --> 14:42.935
That you won't get pregnant
for another year?

14:42.936 --> 14:44.304
I can't make that promise.

14:44.305 --> 14:46.906
You can't?!
You can't?!

14:46.907 --> 14:50.210
(cheering, Marshall whoops)

14:50.211 --> 14:51.411
(classical music playing)

14:51.412 --> 14:52.646
Hmm?

14:54.182 --> 14:58.284
Citrus and honeycomb flavors
with crisp acidity.

14:58.285 --> 15:01.320
It's a sauv blanc, Loire valley.

15:01.321 --> 15:03.088
Town of Sancerre.

15:03.089 --> 15:04.956
Ah. Correct again!

15:04.957 --> 15:06.392
Bravo, boy!

15:06.393 --> 15:08.160
(both laughing)

15:08.161 --> 15:10.729
No! You can't
have kids!

15:10.730 --> 15:12.398
You don't want to bring a child

15:12.399 --> 15:13.732
Into this crazy,
messed-up world.

15:13.733 --> 15:14.899
I don't know.

15:14.900 --> 15:16.234
The world seems pretty awesome
right now, Barney.

15:16.235 --> 15:18.903
(cheering)

15:18.904 --> 15:21.005
Okay, Lily,
you leave me no choice.

15:21.006 --> 15:23.808
If you have a daughter, the day,

15:23.809 --> 15:27.078
Nay, the minute she turns 18...

15:27.079 --> 15:29.146
Gong!
Oh, my God!

15:29.147 --> 15:30.780
Hey, but Lily.

15:30.781 --> 15:34.284
Lily... Babies.

15:34.285 --> 15:35.686
Oh!

15:35.687 --> 15:39.089
I hope
Ted is miserable right now.

15:39.090 --> 15:42.792

15:42.793 --> 15:46.196

15:59.976 --> 16:03.811
Ted, your lyric baritone
is outstanding.

16:03.812 --> 16:07.148
Thank you, Will Shortz.

16:07.149 --> 16:08.783
(crowd cheering)

16:08.784 --> 16:11.119
Fine, you guys can have a baby,

16:11.120 --> 16:13.588
But only under these conditions:

16:13.589 --> 16:16.791
1) you promise to always
love me more than the baby;

16:16.792 --> 16:20.794
2) once a month, I get to use
the baby to pick up chicks;

16:20.795 --> 16:23.664
3) that may involve
the baby falling

16:23.665 --> 16:26.032
From a two-story window
and me heroically catching it;

16:26.033 --> 16:29.236
4) no breastfeeding
in front of me;

16:29.237 --> 16:30.904
5) forget about four.

16:30.905 --> 16:32.573
You can whip them out
whenever you want.

16:32.574 --> 16:35.308
<i>Narrator: And then, something
amazing happened.</i>

16:35.309 --> 16:37.744
(grunts) (gasps)

16:37.745 --> 16:39.512
Holy crap!

16:39.513 --> 16:40.513
I don't believe it.

16:40.514 --> 16:42.315
(whimpers)

16:42.316 --> 16:45.518
Well, of course, hell is an
interesting concept, isn't it?

16:45.519 --> 16:48.021
I've always loved to imagine it

16:48.022 --> 16:50.757
<i>As Dante did in
the divine comedy.</i>

16:50.758 --> 16:52.224
If you'll allow me.

16:52.225 --> 16:54.493
In the original Italian.

16:54.494 --> 16:58.530
(speaking Italian)

17:03.837 --> 17:06.405
<i>Narrator:
I cannot believe this.</i>

17:06.406 --> 17:08.372
<i>I'm reciting
the divine comedy</i>

17:08.373 --> 17:10.175
<i>In its original Italian,</i>

17:10.175 --> 17:12.277
<i>And nobody's making
fart noises!</i>

17:12.278 --> 17:14.478
(speaking Italian)

17:15.848 --> 17:17.015
<i>Wow, this is weird.</i>

17:17.016 --> 17:18.215
<i>Never gotten this far.</i>

17:18.217 --> 17:20.952
(speaking Italian)

17:20.953 --> 17:22.686
<i>You know, I actually sound
kind of douchey.</i>

17:22.688 --> 17:25.387
(speaking Italian)

17:25.388 --> 17:27.757
<i>My God, I'm out of control!</i>

17:27.758 --> 17:30.027
<i>Listen to me.
I'm completely unleashed.</i>

17:30.028 --> 17:32.562
<i>I'm the biggest douche
on the planet.</i>

17:40.237 --> 17:42.338
<i>Ugh! I wish
somebody would stop me.</i>

17:42.339 --> 17:44.540
<i>And then, somebody did.</i>

(phone chirps)

17:45.843 --> 17:47.810
(speaks Italian)

17:47.811 --> 17:50.779
<i>Kids, I think I told you
how earlier that year,</i>

17:50.780 --> 17:53.782
<i>We had seen some doppelgangers
of ourselves around town.</i>

17:53.783 --> 17:56.617
<i>There was lesbian Robin.</i>

17:58.221 --> 18:01.156
<i>There was moustache Marshall.</i>

18:01.157 --> 18:03.458
<i>And, of course, stripper Lily.
(man hooting)</i>

18:03.459 --> 18:06.594
<i>Well, that night,</i>

18:06.595 --> 18:08.796
<i>One more doppelganger
surfaced--</i>

18:08.797 --> 18:11.665
<i>Mexican wrestler Ted.</i>

18:11.666 --> 18:16.270
<i>Soy el conquistador
de las máquinas!</i>

18:16.271 --> 18:18.438
All three:
Oh!

18:18.439 --> 18:20.474
Oh!

18:20.475 --> 18:23.077
(Lily screams, cheering)

18:23.078 --> 18:25.079
(yelling)

18:25.080 --> 18:27.513
(crowd cheering)

18:27.514 --> 18:29.349
I got to go.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.588
Rule number 83.

18:35.589 --> 18:37.590
If anything
that comes out of that baby

18:37.591 --> 18:40.693
Gets on one of my suits,
I get to touch Lily's boobs.

18:40.694 --> 18:43.429
Dude, what is it with you
and my wife's boobs tonight?

18:43.430 --> 18:46.131
Hey, hey,
I don't make the rules.

18:47.634 --> 18:50.436
Baby, are you really starting
to think about this?

18:50.437 --> 18:51.970
I don't know.

18:51.971 --> 18:53.606
Maybe a little.

18:53.607 --> 18:55.140
Okay.

18:55.141 --> 18:57.610
Well, for whatever it's worth,
I think that we're ready.

18:57.611 --> 18:58.677
I mean, look,

18:58.678 --> 19:00.177
We love each other,

19:00.178 --> 19:02.046
We're financially stable,
and honestly, I don't think

19:02.047 --> 19:03.915
It would change our lifestyle
all that much.

19:03.916 --> 19:05.216
<i>Narrator:
Aunt Lily still likes</i>

19:05.217 --> 19:07.051
<i>To remind Uncle Marshall
he once said this.</i>

19:07.052 --> 19:09.454
Marshall, if we were at home
with a baby tonight,

19:09.455 --> 19:11.155
We never would have seen
Ted's doppelganger.

19:11.156 --> 19:12.223
Imagine missing that.

19:12.224 --> 19:13.691
How would that feel?

19:13.692 --> 19:16.126
I would blame that child
for the rest of his life.

19:16.127 --> 19:18.495
Exactly.
For the rest of her life.

19:19.464 --> 19:21.765
Okay, you're right.

19:21.766 --> 19:22.999
There's, there's no hurry.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.868
Okay, how about this?

19:24.869 --> 19:27.270
We agree there's no sense
in having a baby

19:27.271 --> 19:29.473
Until we've seen
all five doppelgangers, right?

19:29.474 --> 19:31.474
Of course. Stands to reason.

19:31.475 --> 19:33.776
Okay, so when we finally see
Barney's doppelganger,

19:33.777 --> 19:36.178
That's the universe
telling us it's go time.

19:36.179 --> 19:39.148
And that's when
we'll start trying. Deal?

19:39.149 --> 19:41.116
Deal.

19:42.218 --> 19:43.853
Hey, guys.
Hey.

19:43.854 --> 19:45.387
Well, well, look who thinks

19:45.388 --> 19:47.056
He can just waltz in here

19:47.057 --> 19:48.924
And be part of the gang again.

19:48.925 --> 19:50.391
Well, you can forget it.

19:50.392 --> 19:51.993
Listen, Barney, I...

19:51.994 --> 19:53.495
Please be part
of the gang again!

19:53.496 --> 19:55.063
I don't want
to lose anyone else!

19:55.064 --> 19:56.565
We're all really sorry.

19:56.566 --> 19:58.967
We'll even let you recite
all the douchey poems you want,

19:58.968 --> 20:01.703
And we'll never, never say
a bad thing about it, I promise.

20:01.704 --> 20:03.371
Really? Because

20:03.372 --> 20:05.372
There actually is a poem
I'd like to recite--

20:05.373 --> 20:08.241
"friendship" by
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

20:08.242 --> 20:11.912
"a ruddy drop of manly blood,
the surging sea outweighs.

20:11.913 --> 20:13.581
The world uncertain
comes and goes..""

20:13.582 --> 20:15.683
(blowing raspberry loudly)

20:15.684 --> 20:18.686
I'm sorry.
Someone had to do that.

20:18.687 --> 20:20.720
Who wants another drink?
I'm buying.

20:20.721 --> 20:23.490
<i>Narrator: Kids, I'd love to
tell you that over e e years,</i>

20:23.491 --> 20:25.257
<i>We didn't all drift apart
a little</i>

20:25.258 --> 20:26.626
<i>At one time or another.</i>

20:26.627 --> 20:29.362
<i>You don't mean
for it to happen, but it does.</i>

20:29.363 --> 20:31.764
<i>But no matter what,
to this day,</i>

20:31.765 --> 20:33.733
<i>Come hell or high water,</i>

20:33.734 --> 20:36.201
<i>We still all get together
every year</i>

20:36.202 --> 20:38.269
<i>For Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>

20:43.002 --> 20:45.671
Good night! Thanks a lot.
I had a great time.

20:51.809 --> 20:52.976
(deeply):
Willem.

20:52.977 --> 20:54.143
(high-pitched):
Dafoe!

20:54.994 --> 20:56.662
(deeply):
Willem.

20:56.663 --> 20:57.963
(high-pitched):
Dafoe!

20:57.964 --> 20:59.232
(deeply):
Willem.

20:59.233 --> 21:01.234
(high-pitched):
Dafoe!
