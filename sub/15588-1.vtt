(MESS AROUND PLAYING)

00:26.800 --> 00:30.588
(SINGING) Oh, no
Oh, no

00:33.760 --> 00:39.915
Ahhh, oh, no
Ahhh, oh, no

00:40.000 --> 00:43.072
Ahhh, oh, no

00:43.160 --> 00:48.632
No, she don't mess around
No, she don't mess around

00:52.840 --> 00:55.274
MIKE: 100% blue agave.

00:55.800 --> 00:56.835
Taste it.

00:56.920 --> 00:58.512
RANDY: Look, Mike,
I like you.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.955
But no one's looking for
another brand of tequila.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.560
They've got the three...
What is it?

01:02.600 --> 01:04.477
The Cuervo, the other one,
and the third one.

01:04.680 --> 01:06.159
And they don't need
more tequila.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.880
If I can't sell it,
it's not gonna sell.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.154
People want the new-new.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.673
The "new-new"?
The "new-new."

01:10.880 --> 01:11.995
They want that new-new.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.080
No!

01:13.160 --> 01:15.628
What if I could sell
this tequila to a customer?

01:15.840 --> 01:16.896
Would I have
your order then?

01:16.920 --> 01:17.920
(LAUGHS) Yeah, sure.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.800
And I'm just gonna pick
a customer at random.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.080
Excuse me, sir.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.311
Do you enjoy
the taste of tequila?

01:25.320 --> 01:26.536
(IN AUSTRALIAN ACCENT)
Why, yes, I do.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.039
But I only drink
my particular brand,

01:28.160 --> 01:29.752
and you will not
convince me otherwise.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.080
It's a perfect candidate.
Because it's your brother!

01:32.160 --> 01:33.275
I know that's your brother.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.714
He dated my niece.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.096
Look, mate,
I don't know your niece.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.872
Okay.
But if I did...

01:38.040 --> 01:39.393
I'd say she was
a little clingy,

01:39.520 --> 01:40.920
and she'd freak
a lot of people out.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.797
We play Words With Friends
together, right?

01:42.960 --> 01:44.075
Dave, right?

01:44.200 --> 01:45.997
Name's Rick.
Just got in from Melbourne.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.160
His name's Rick.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.514
I know he's your brother.

01:48.720 --> 01:49.720
Look, look, look.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.160
You guys are funny,
you're weird.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.519
We do this
every couple weeks...

01:54.000 --> 01:55.240
All right, I'll take 10 cases.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.376
Fuck, yes!
(IN NORMAL ACCENT) Yes!

01:56.400 --> 01:57.400
Yes! I knew it!

01:57.640 --> 01:58.696
We sold your ass, Randy!
(DAVE WHOOPS)

01:58.720 --> 01:59.856
I don't know
if that's what happened.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.256
It was the hat, right?
Was it the hat?

02:01.280 --> 02:02.440
I just found this over there.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.551
(DO SOMETHING CRAZY PLAYING)

02:12.720 --> 02:14.358

Make the party start

02:14.440 --> 02:16.317
Don't need no R&R

02:16.400 --> 02:18.231
To regular life,
I say au revoir

02:18.360 --> 02:20.635
Yay! Living life
in the fast lane

02:20.720 --> 02:22.278
Now your pain

02:22.400 --> 02:25.870
So please come join me
One thing, good vibes only

02:26.400 --> 02:29.949
Start the keg
I'mma fill my cup

02:30.080 --> 02:33.390
Got fireworks, got booze
Let's blow some shit up

02:34.240 --> 02:35.958
Tonight I'm going stupid

02:36.080 --> 02:37.672
Doing things I've never done

02:38.200 --> 02:40.350
We all got one thing in common

02:40.440 --> 02:42.271
We just wanna have fun

Do something crazy

02:47.720 --> 02:48.720
Okay

02:49.400 --> 02:50.435
Do something crazy

02:53.400 --> 02:54.400
Do what you wanna do

02:57.320 --> 02:58.320
Do something crazy

03:01.320 --> 03:02.320
I'm about to do

03:03.400 --> 03:04.400
I'm about to do

03:05.440 --> 03:06.440
Do something crazy

03:07.120 --> 03:08.120
Do something crazy

03:08.280 --> 03:10.316
Do something wild

03:10.440 --> 03:11.953
Rolling with the homies

03:12.080 --> 03:14.071

Live for the moment

03:16.400 --> 03:18.152

03:18.280 --> 03:20.157
Turn up the music

03:20.280 --> 03:21.952
Only good vibes

03:22.440 --> 03:23.976
DAVE: Sorry to throw
the accent at you, bro.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.816
MIKE: No, dude. I loved it,
and it kept me in the now.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.193
Do you realize
that that sale

03:27.280 --> 03:28.760
puts us at number three
in the office?

03:28.800 --> 03:30.296
The Stangle bros
are killing it right now!

03:30.320 --> 03:31.320
(LAUGHING)

03:31.520 --> 03:33.736
MIKE: It's not an actual hat.
They just call it a jimmy hat.

03:33.760 --> 03:34.909
If you wear two, they break.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.150
It's an urban legend...
No, it's not.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.320
Mom, Dad?

03:40.120 --> 03:41.314
DAVE: Jeanie. Eric.

03:41.480 --> 03:44.313
Don't freak out.
I don't want you to freak out.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.549
Just come on in.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.677
BURT: Why don't we all
just sit down?

03:47.760 --> 03:48.760
We gotta talk to you.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.456
We wanna discuss
Jeanie and Eric's wedding.

03:51.480 --> 03:52.595
DAVE: Oh! Sweet.
MIKE: Okay.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.136
DAVE: Are you guys thinking
DJ or band?

03:54.160 --> 03:55.240
First thought, band, right?

03:55.360 --> 03:56.952
No. People want to
hear the real songs.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.350
You don't want to hear
a guy singing Beyoncé.

03:59.480 --> 04:00.754
You just want to hear Beyoncé.

04:00.840 --> 04:01.840
Oh.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.070
Yeah, but we want to
talk about...

04:04.160 --> 04:05.991
is you two.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.839
Now, over the years...

04:09.160 --> 04:12.038
a theme has emerged
at our family gatherings.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.599
Everyone's having
a good time...

04:13.880 --> 04:14.880
That's right.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.069
Things are going smoothly.

04:16.160 --> 04:17.228
Party time.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.430
And then you two show up...

04:19.519 --> 04:20.519
stag...

04:20.800 --> 04:21.834
and you hit on girls...

04:22.040 --> 04:23.109
you act like idiots...

04:23.320 --> 04:24.833
and you ruin it.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Ruin it.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.430
What? We are not party ruiners!
Mm-mm.

04:28.720 --> 04:29.914
We're party creators!

04:30.240 --> 04:33.038
And besides, when have we
ever ruined a family event?

04:33.360 --> 04:34.475
Ah!
(LAUGHS)

04:34.560 --> 04:35.720
We thought you
might say that.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.016
ROSIE: Yep, here we go.
And we just stream it.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.040
BURT: Apple TV.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.160
We just need your password.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.713
Bryan's baby dick 69.
Yeah.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.353
BURT: Bryan's baby dick 69.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.318
What the fuck,
guys? Really?

04:44.480 --> 04:45.480
Got it. Yep.
Is that it?

04:45.560 --> 04:46.560
BURT: Good.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.156
Happy Fourth of July!

04:50.400 --> 04:51.435
(ALL CHEERING)

04:51.560 --> 04:52.595
Oh, shit!

04:55.040 --> 04:56.439
(ALL SCREAMING)

04:56.600 --> 04:58.033
It was fun up
to that point.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.913
(EXPLOSION)
(ALL SCREAMING)

05:01.840 --> 05:02.840
(BOTH LAUGHING)

05:07.040 --> 05:09.110
God damn it! My trailer!

05:11.400 --> 05:12.753
(ALL CHEERING)

05:13.880 --> 05:14.880
(SCREAMING)

05:17.280 --> 05:18.349
(LAUGHING) Oh, shit.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.736
Actually, this is what
we're trying to avoid.

05:20.760 --> 05:21.988
(CRYING)
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

05:22.080 --> 05:23.096
The both of you
are fucking idiots.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.120
Fucking losers!

05:25.920 --> 05:27.035
(ALL CHEERING)

05:28.400 --> 05:29.400
(COUGHING)

05:33.280 --> 05:36.272
JEANIE: Grandpa, wake up!
Take his tie.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.896
Are you saying
we had something to do

05:37.920 --> 05:39.558
with Grandfather's death?
Hmm?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.710
He died five years
after that!

05:41.880 --> 05:43.757
That is a lot of guilt
to put us. Shame on you.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.309
Plus, this video only
shows the screw-ups.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.750
Where's the epic tracking
shots of smiling faces?

05:49.440 --> 05:51.080
And everybody looking
at us, just going...

05:51.240 --> 05:53.276
"God, I love Mike and Dave.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.510
"They made this whole
party worth it."

05:55.760 --> 05:58.274
When are the two of you
going to grow up?

05:58.480 --> 06:00.596
This shtick was cute
for a while...

06:00.760 --> 06:02.159
but it's gotten stale.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.231
Mom, come on,
what are you...

06:04.960 --> 06:06.040
You're talking
about us like

06:06.120 --> 06:07.600
we're a couple of
losers or something.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.136
BURT: What we don't
want you to do is

06:09.160 --> 06:10.832
go chasing girls
and get out of control.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.274
You understand?

06:12.440 --> 06:13.896
Wait, we can still
talk to girls, right?

06:13.920 --> 06:15.319
You can each talk
to one girl.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.080
The girls that you bring
to the wedding.

06:17.520 --> 06:18.520
What do you mean?

06:18.600 --> 06:20.477
I want you to bring a date.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.517
That's two dates.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.114
You want us to bring
dates to a wedding?

06:25.200 --> 06:26.200
Excuse me?

06:26.320 --> 06:27.435
Are you allowed
to do that?

06:27.600 --> 06:28.800
Nice, respectable,
smart girls!

06:29.120 --> 06:30.269
Keep you in line.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.634
What the fuck?
What?

06:31.800 --> 06:33.160
Are you insane?
Oh, you're kidding.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.515
You are not screwing up
this wedding. Do you hear me?

06:35.680 --> 06:37.280
Mom, do you hear
this river of horse shit

06:37.320 --> 06:38.435
coming out of Dad's mouth?

06:38.600 --> 06:41.637
We don't want you showing up
stag and riling each other up!

06:41.800 --> 06:42.949
We don't rile each other up!

06:43.080 --> 06:44.195
We never get riled up!

06:44.360 --> 06:45.395
I don't get riled!

06:45.480 --> 06:46.680
He doesn't
and I don't, either!

06:46.840 --> 06:48.353
Look at you right now!
You're riled!

06:48.480 --> 06:49.576
Take your head
out of your ass, Dad!

06:49.600 --> 06:50.680
You sound insane right now.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.314
Everybody stop yelling! Okay?

06:53.480 --> 06:55.710
You guys bringing
wedding dates was my idea.

06:57.280 --> 06:59.840
Look, I love the shit
out of you guys.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.878
But everyone
is already stressed out

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
about this wedding...

07:03.360 --> 07:06.033
and I just need you
to be cool.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.960
Of course, Jeanie!

07:08.160 --> 07:09.479
Please?

07:09.640 --> 07:10.675
For me?

07:10.880 --> 07:12.216
I promise.
We would never do anything

07:12.240 --> 07:13.240
to mess up your wedding.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.068
MIKE: Jeanie, we love you.

07:15.640 --> 07:16.936
We want this to be
the best day of your life.

07:16.960 --> 07:17.960
Yeah.

07:18.040 --> 07:19.109
You, too, Eric.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.394
Oh.
Oh. Thank you.

07:20.680 --> 07:21.736
Mostly you, though, Jeanie.

07:21.760 --> 07:22.760
(CHUCKLES)

07:22.840 --> 07:24.856
If you want us to bring dates,
we're bringing dates.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.040
All right, it's settled then.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.799
Wedding dates!

07:29.160 --> 07:30.360
Dave, buddy,
let me talk to you

07:30.480 --> 07:31.708
for a second, okay? Listen.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.916
I'm sorry to lump you
in with Mike...

07:34.080 --> 07:35.896
but if I only told your older
brother to bring a date...

07:35.920 --> 07:37.558
he'd get all weird about it.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.830
I just feel like
he's holding you back.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.720
Dad, I don't mind
being lumped in with Mike.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.216
Do you remember
the fifth grade bake sale...

07:43.240 --> 07:44.440
when Mom made
those cupcakes...

07:44.560 --> 07:45.709
and I called them moist?

07:45.880 --> 07:46.949
Mm-hmm.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.195
Everyone called me Moist...

07:48.400 --> 07:50.277
till Mike took a cupcake...

07:50.440 --> 07:53.034
and shoved it
in Tom Ginty's face.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.550
He said,
"Now you're moist, Moist."

07:57.680 --> 07:59.750
That's the kind
of guy Mike is.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.559
So, think on that...

08:02.520 --> 08:03.714
Dad.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.056
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to end that

08:07.080 --> 08:08.120
on such a weird note, Dad.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.240
I love you. And thanks.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.376
Good. I don't want
you to be mad.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.536
I'm not even mad.
I'm not even upset.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.680
We're gonna find some dates.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.080
TATIANA: I gotta say,
some nights,

08:15.120 --> 08:16.314
I am not looking my best.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.556
But tonight is not

I am a strong
independent woman.

09:59.560 --> 10:03.155
And I will get on a table
and shake my shit to RiRi.

I'm just sort of surprised
it didn't happen sooner...

10:25.720 --> 10:27.153

Hey!

10:27.680 --> 10:30.558
Alice, you do not apologize
right now, okay?

10:30.680 --> 10:31.880
You didn't do one thing wrong.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.195
Okay. People need to
get in line with you.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.436
Right. You're right.

ALICE: Because
it's therapeutic.

I'm picturing his dick

10:58.920 --> 11:01.070

science fair?

11:14.240 --> 11:15.719
Or gave us water balloon tits

11:15.800 --> 11:17.576

also super hot.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.317
Yeah, he's hot as
fucking balls.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.875
But just to repeat,
we're looking for nice girls.

15:24.040 --> 15:27.350
Like, girls that our mom
and our sister would like.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.830
Okay, look, dude,
we are going to Hawaii.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.439
Let's go on vacation.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.517
But it's not a vacation.
It's a wedding.

15:34.800 --> 15:35.976
Do you really think
a wedding's

15:36.000 --> 15:37.069
the best place for me?

15:37.240 --> 15:40.516
Since the last wedding
I went to was mine...

15:40.680 --> 15:42.159
and it didn't turn out
very well.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.240
I hear you, but look...

15:43.480 --> 15:45.914
this shit is why this shit
is perfect, okay?

15:46.080 --> 15:48.280
Because ever since Luke left,
you haven't been the same.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.988
You need to get over that,
once and for all.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.229
And this our shot, man.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.511
That dude, he's gonna get
your groove back.

15:54.760 --> 15:55.909
This right here

15:56.040 --> 15:57.758
is an opportunity
of a lifetime...

15:57.920 --> 16:00.070
and you know
we are entrepreneurs.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.240
You know what?

16:01.400 --> 16:03.675
Let's make these guys
take us to Hawaii!

16:03.840 --> 16:05.512
You're right! Let's do it!

16:05.680 --> 16:06.680
Let's just do it!

16:06.720 --> 16:07.960
Yes, bitch.
Let's fucking do it!

16:08.760 --> 16:10.096
We'll be right back.
(WOMEN WHOOPING)

16:10.120 --> 16:11.320
TATIANA:
We gonna go to Hawaii!

16:11.400 --> 16:13.356
We gonna go to Hawaii!

16:15.040 --> 16:16.040
Whoa! Whoa!

16:16.240 --> 16:17.389
Hold up!
What?

16:18.760 --> 16:20.478
Those boys said
they wanted nice girls.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.073
We don't look like
nice girls.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.957
Yeah, I guess I haven't
showered in a while.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.071
Fine, well, you know
what we're gonna do?

16:28.400 --> 16:31.073
We're gonna look
respectable as fuck.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.554
Like nice girls.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.919
Ugh. (SNIFFLES)

16:36.080 --> 16:38.150
Dude, it's like
that Jesus rag!

16:39.240 --> 16:40.798
Ow! It's part of me.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.591
Tatiana, your underwear
needs more underwears.

16:45.040 --> 16:46.040
Whoo!

16:48.480 --> 16:50.436
Oh, this dress is my bitch!

16:53.080 --> 16:55.071
Dude, we have met
37 insane women.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.640
We can't bring
any of these girls.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.796
Maybe Dad'll just forget
about his ultimatum.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.918
Why would Dad forget
about an old tomato?

17:03.480 --> 17:05.117
No, his ultimatum.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.429
Old tom...
Ultimatum.

17:06.599 --> 17:07.720
Are you saying "old tomato"?

17:07.960 --> 17:10.520
Ultima-tomb.
Like a tomb or a crypt.

17:10.599 --> 17:11.635
Ultimatum.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.976
Well, we gotta figure
something out,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.036
because the wedding's
coming up quick.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.400
(SIGHS)

17:25.119 --> 17:26.896
BOTH: Why is everything
a competition with you?

17:26.920 --> 17:29.150
And I said that first,
so actually, I won that.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.336
ALICE: So what time
are we meeting them?

17:33.360 --> 17:35.112
Technically, no time.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.636
Yeah, because I was thinking
about emailing them...

17:38.800 --> 17:40.438
but then I was
thinking, um...

17:40.600 --> 17:43.478
what kind of floozy-ass bimbo
would respond to that ad?

17:43.800 --> 17:44.835
Um...

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Us.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.456
Yeah, but we're not
like those idiots.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.595
You know what I'm saying?

17:48.760 --> 17:51.558
Because they're all like,
"Oh! Pick me, pick me!"

17:51.880 --> 17:53.871
It's like the guys
interviewing the girls.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.508
Like, it immediately would put
us in an inferior position.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.880
We're gonna flip the script
and Bachelorette that shit.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.136
Those guys would be
lucky to have us.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.160
Right.

18:01.320 --> 18:02.336
We just gotta
make them think so.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.360
Okay, right.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.675
But, you know, I'm really
not good at lying...

18:05.760 --> 18:06.936
because I always
try to start small

18:06.960 --> 18:08.075
and then it gets crazy...

18:08.160 --> 18:09.195
and I make-up stuff

18:09.320 --> 18:10.833
that couldn't
possibly be true.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.754
Baby, you can do this.
Let's practice, okay?

18:13.840 --> 18:14.840
Okay.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.240
Um, what do you like to do?
Drink.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.314
Just sweet teas.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.516
Sweet teas
and biscuits on blimps.

18:20.680 --> 18:21.680
All right, straight up,

18:21.800 --> 18:22.976
you don't have to
do an accent.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.035
I was doing an accent?

18:24.200 --> 18:25.496
And definitely
don't bring up blimps.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.839
Shit! They're leaving.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.400
If it was a competition,
I won it.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.630
All right, don't worry.

18:30.800 --> 18:31.840
It's all part of the plan.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.069
Is it?
Oh, yeah.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.468
What does that mean?
What plan?

18:34.560 --> 18:35.816
I don't know
this part of the plan...

18:35.840 --> 18:36.840
Whoo! Ahh!

and then there's a hedge fund.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.590
And our fund...

20:33.440 --> 20:34.475
Uh, we hedge it.

about being a teacher...

is teaching cursive.

23:03.520 --> 23:05.238
Hey, uh,
this might sound crazy...

23:05.440 --> 23:07.954
but our little sister is
getting married in Hawaii...

23:08.320 --> 23:09.912
and we wanted to know

23:10.000 --> 23:12.275
if you guys
wanted to come with.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.959
Um... (LAUGHS)
Um...

23:14.120 --> 23:16.190
Can you just
give us a second to...

23:16.760 --> 23:17.988
Of course.

23:18.160 --> 23:21.118
Okay, so just whisper
like we're talking it over...

23:21.280 --> 23:22.416
like we're not sure
if we wanna go or not.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.440
ALICE: Oh, like...

23:29.200 --> 23:30.280
What the fuck
are you doing?

23:30.440 --> 23:32.016
ALICE: I don't understand
why we're arguing!

23:32.040 --> 23:33.189
I thought we wanted to go.

23:33.360 --> 23:34.656
All right, fuck it.
Let's go to Hawaii!

23:34.680 --> 23:35.715
(WHOOPS)

23:35.840 --> 23:37.159
Yes! Fuck yes!
ALICE: Hawaii!

23:37.360 --> 23:39.032
(ALL WHOOPING)

23:39.760 --> 23:40.760
(FEEL SO GOOD PLAYING)

23:40.840 --> 23:42.056
Yo, what you know
about goin' out?

23:42.080 --> 23:44.275
Head west, red Lex
TV's all up in the headrest

23:44.400 --> 23:46.630
Try and live it up,
ride true, a bigger truck

23:46.720 --> 23:49.234
Peeps all glittered up
Stick up can, they go what?

23:49.360 --> 23:51.191
Jig wit it 'cuz ship crisp,
split it all

23:51.280 --> 23:53.430
Ho's ride, get your nut
'till I can't get it up

23:53.600 --> 23:56.717
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy

23:56.840 --> 23:58.159
You make me feel so good

23:58.240 --> 23:59.240
Aloha, and welcome.

23:59.400 --> 24:00.400
Hi.
Aloha.

24:00.520 --> 24:01.589
For real?

24:01.680 --> 24:03.320
Let me get you gentlemen
checked in, yeah?

24:04.560 --> 24:07.393
Holy shit,
this place is nice!

24:08.560 --> 24:10.676
It's gonna be more nice.

24:10.880 --> 24:13.075
Nice girls don't show
off their ecstasy.

24:13.240 --> 24:14.514
One of these
is a multivitamin.

24:14.720 --> 24:15.720
Is this shit free?

24:15.880 --> 24:17.233
I can smoke weed
out of this,

24:17.360 --> 24:18.588
I can smoke weed
out of this...

24:18.800 --> 24:21.917
Look at that teacher,
grabbing her apple a day.

24:22.360 --> 24:25.193
Look at that personality
from behind.

24:25.400 --> 24:27.277
It is, dare I say...

24:27.480 --> 24:28.913
well-rounded.
Mmm-hmm.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.040
TATIANA: Look at Mike.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.376
He looks like
a funhouse mirror version

24:31.400 --> 24:32.480
of a better looking dude...

24:33.400 --> 24:34.674
but he is just that dude.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.871
Dave, it is so on
this weekend.

24:38.080 --> 24:40.435
(LAUGHS) I am not touching
this guy the whole weekend.

24:40.600 --> 24:41.856
He thinks just because
he brought me here

24:41.880 --> 24:42.880
I'm gonna sleep with him?

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Check it out.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.230
If this was Mike's dick,
I'd be like...

24:46.320 --> 24:48.117
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo...
(LAUGHING)

24:48.240 --> 24:49.720
I'd get close,
but I'd never touch it.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.749
They have such
beautiful flowers here.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.275
She's throwing out
serious vibes right now.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.475
I'm like, I'm hungry.

24:56.560 --> 24:57.788
I'm gonna
butter them biscuits.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.752
I'm gonna baste
them ham hocks.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.273
I'm gonna be
like a sex chef.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.397
Mr. Grey will see you now.

25:03.760 --> 25:04.909
I'm gonna touch Dave.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.520
Every time he says
something sweet...

25:06.640 --> 25:08.232
I wanna get
some rope and chain

25:08.360 --> 25:09.679
in bulk from Home Depot...

25:09.840 --> 25:11.751
and just see where
it takes us, you know?

25:11.920 --> 25:13.672
That is messed up.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.077
Ladies,
your wedding itineraries.

25:16.280 --> 25:17.679
# DoingltForJeanie.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.736
DAVE: Today, we have the
meet and greet by the pool.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.751
And then after that,
we have a dolphin excursion.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.353
Friday is
the rehearsal dinner.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.509
Mmm-hmm.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.736
That's where Dave and I are
gonna be doing our big speech.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.796
(CLEARS THROAT)
Will there be any downtime?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.816
ALICE: Yeah, 'cause I gotta
keep in touch with the office.

25:30.840 --> 25:33.035
I gotta call my stocks
about the state of my bonds.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.120
It happens a lot.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.794
Mm-kay, I think
we are right up here.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.273
Great. So which one
is me and Alice's room?

25:41.800 --> 25:42.915
Uh...

25:43.000 --> 25:46.310
I don't know. Are you
and Alice gonna share a room?

25:46.520 --> 25:48.795
Or I was thinking
that maybe you and I...

25:48.880 --> 25:50.632
would stay in the same room.

25:52.520 --> 25:55.637
That sounds interesting...

25:55.800 --> 25:57.791
but I don't think
it would be a good idea.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.160
Why not?

26:02.680 --> 26:05.194
(WHISPERING) Because I don't
trust myself around you.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.159
You can trust me.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.515
I do trust you.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.639
Let's trust each other.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.877
There's so much trust.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.395
Sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.675
I respect you so much,
I can't wait to get you alone.

26:19.760 --> 26:20.760
Yeah, we're gonna cover

26:20.840 --> 26:22.056
all the room charges
and stuff...

26:22.080 --> 26:23.593
for up to $50 per day.

26:23.680 --> 26:24.896
Oh, my God.
You don't have to do that.

26:24.920 --> 26:26.990
I'm a very strict teacher.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.633
You be Michelle Pfeiffer

26:28.720 --> 26:30.995
from Dangerous Minds,
and I'll be...

26:31.160 --> 26:32.434
I'll be Coolio.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.511
Coolio's not in that movie.
Oh.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.718
He is in song and spirit.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.633
I'm gonna call a
parent-teacher conference...

26:41.720 --> 26:44.518
and tell them what
a bad boy you are.

26:44.680 --> 26:45.908
Please don't tell my mommy.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.519
Please don't tell my daddy.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.591
I think Wi-Fi is included,
too, so...

26:49.680 --> 26:50.880
That's always nice. Yeah.
Yeah.

26:51.160 --> 26:55.119
If I were to give you a grade,
I'd give you a D.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.394
A big, hard D.

26:56.640 --> 26:57.959
Why? I deserve an A.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.519
What are you talking about?
Oh.

26:59.720 --> 27:00.755
Nothing.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.239
In conclusion...

27:02.400 --> 27:04.789
I'm gonna stay in the room...

27:04.960 --> 27:06.029
with Alice.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.111
That one, with Alice.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.633
Cool, cool. No doubt.

27:13.120 --> 27:16.192
Somebody overcooked
the soft pretzel.

27:17.440 --> 27:18.536
My dick is hard.
That's what I'm saying.

27:18.560 --> 27:19.629
Give me five minutes.

27:19.720 --> 27:22.280
Oh, my God. Ew!

27:22.600 --> 27:24.477
(SINGING)
Lift it, drop it, shake it

27:24.560 --> 27:27.233
It's going down for real

27:31.320 --> 27:33.595
It's going down for real

27:35.160 --> 27:36.560
Grandma, I'd like you
to meet Alice.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.216
She's super smart,
great conversationalist,

27:38.240 --> 27:39.400
and she works on Wall Street.

27:39.480 --> 27:40.833
But I'm one of
the good ones.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.399
(LAUGHS) I think she is.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.320
TATIANA: I am a teacher, yeah.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.600
And you know what?

27:47.640 --> 27:49.320
The key to teaching children
is repetition.

27:49.400 --> 27:51.311
You'd be surprised
how stupid they are.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.592
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

28:01.200 --> 28:02.200
Jeanie!

28:02.760 --> 28:03.909
(GASPS)

28:04.760 --> 28:06.512
Hey, you!
Hi! Hi!

28:07.000 --> 28:09.514
I'm so proud to introduce
our wedding dates...

28:09.680 --> 28:11.318
Tatiana.
And Alice.

28:12.640 --> 28:13.834
Hi!

28:14.800 --> 28:15.936
Oh, the bride.
The gorgeous bride.

28:15.960 --> 28:16.960
Ow! Hi.

28:17.120 --> 28:20.795
This weekend is all about you
being happy and not shattered.

28:20.960 --> 28:21.960
Oh. Thank you.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.075
Yeah.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.160
Check out your arms.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.520
You got some
Michelle Obama arms.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.031
How'd you get those guns
on the plane, girl?

28:28.120 --> 28:29.120
(ALL LAUGHING)

28:29.200 --> 28:30.599
Eric...

28:30.680 --> 28:32.880
you are two points hotter
just being next to this woman.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.136
TATIANA: Try 10 points hotter.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.160
Try a million.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.240
That's too many points.

28:36.360 --> 28:37.440
Wow, and Jeanie, nice snag.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.480
Thank you.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.256
TATIANA: You guys
look great together, really.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.554
I'm liking this. Huh?

28:41.760 --> 28:43.656
Maybe you two will keep these
two in check a little bit.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.511
(ALL LAUGHING)
I think we can.

28:45.760 --> 28:46.988
I'll just keep him on a leash.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.918
Maybe don't hurt him.
(CHOKING)

28:49.000 --> 28:50.479
I like these girls.

28:50.640 --> 28:51.709
They're so fun.

28:51.880 --> 28:53.996
Unlike my maid of honor.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.269
She's having a time.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.600
How is ol' Becky Grammerstein?

28:56.680 --> 28:57.680
(SHUSHING) She's coming.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.159
Jeanie.
Hey.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.639
I'm in crisis mode.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.478
I ordered Prosecco
for the mani-pedis...

29:02.640 --> 29:03.840
and all they have
is champagne!

29:03.920 --> 29:05.000
Aren't they the same thing?

29:05.160 --> 29:06.275
No. No, they're not. No.

29:06.360 --> 29:07.509
No?

29:08.160 --> 29:09.832
Hello, Michael.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Hi, Dave.

29:11.520 --> 29:14.990
Look, I'm trying to make
your dreams come true, okay?

29:15.160 --> 29:16.195
Right.
What?

29:16.320 --> 29:18.151
If this is bad news,
I'm gonna eat your ass.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.275
Sorry.
Okay.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.356
Purple. It better be purple.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.716
I should probably
go see to that.

29:23.880 --> 29:24.880
You'll come?
Yeah.

29:25.040 --> 29:26.359
Thank you so much
for being here.

29:26.520 --> 29:29.432
Guys, good job
with these two.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.079
Mahalo.

29:31.280 --> 29:32.508
DAVE: Bye, Jeanie.

29:32.680 --> 29:33.816
(WHISPERS)
Jeanie likes the girls.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.080
(SINGING)
Jeanie likes the girls

29:35.240 --> 29:36.800
Talk about Jeanie
Jeanie likes the girls

29:36.840 --> 29:38.637
Because it's all about
Jeanie likes the girls

29:38.720 --> 29:39.856
Oh, yeah,
Jeanie likes the girls

29:39.880 --> 29:40.880
Come on!

29:40.960 --> 29:42.400
It's all about Jeanie
Likes the girls

29:42.480 --> 29:43.616
It's all about
Jeanie likes the girls!

29:43.640 --> 29:45.278
Mike. Where are the girls?

29:45.360 --> 29:46.554
BURT: Oh, hello!
I'm Alice.

29:46.840 --> 29:48.016
I just I wanna give you a hug.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.439
It's so nice to meet you.

29:49.640 --> 29:50.960
Fucking A.
You distracted me, man.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.071
This dress is lucky to be
on you. Those pins!

29:53.200 --> 29:54.269
My Mike?
Yes.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.629
I can't... Wow.
He did.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.472
That's fantastic.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.312
Mike, Tatiana was
just telling me...

29:59.440 --> 30:00.873
that you saved her life.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.314
I most certainly did,
Father.

30:02.560 --> 30:05.279
You see how great it is
to have nice girls around?

30:05.360 --> 30:06.640
I mean, these are nice girls.
Aw!

30:06.680 --> 30:07.795
Absolutely.

30:07.920 --> 30:09.136
They are.
And we brought them, so...

30:09.160 --> 30:10.388
KEITH: Excuse me.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.600
Excuse me.

30:11.680 --> 30:12.696
See you in a minute.
Honey, come on.

30:12.720 --> 30:13.856
Can I get
everybody's attention?

30:13.880 --> 30:14.880
Could we gather around?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.353
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

30:16.480 --> 30:18.232
We're killing this shit!
We're killing.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.549
Mom and Dad like the girls!

30:19.640 --> 30:20.709
Ow.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.233
(SINGING)
Mom and Dad like the girls

30:22.400 --> 30:24.311
Hi, I'm Keith.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.914
I'm Eric's best man,
his cousin...

30:27.080 --> 30:29.071
and his best friend.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.759
Welcome to the meet and greet!

30:30.960 --> 30:32.029
(ALL CHEERING)

30:32.120 --> 30:33.394
MIKE: Yeah!

30:33.680 --> 30:34.749
Put your hands together...

30:34.920 --> 30:38.037
for Eric and his lovely bride,
Jeanie.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.792
Give it up!
(ALL CHEERING)

30:39.920 --> 30:41.069
Jeanie!

30:41.240 --> 30:42.832
Hey, everybody.
A big thank you

30:42.920 --> 30:44.751
to my new family,
the Stangles.

30:44.920 --> 30:45.989
We love you, Eric!

into "bottoms up." (LAUGHS)

it actually means...

31:10.320 --> 31:11.958
which is inappropriate.

this is my cousin, Mike.

jealous of?

Okay, this is actually
a very fashion-forward outfit.

it's gonna be bad.

it's not as bad as you think.

Have you seen her face?

41:38.080 --> 41:39.911
Oh, God! What?

41:40.080 --> 41:41.216
It looks like
you were making meth,

41:55.000 --> 41:57.195
This side,
there's a little...

41:57.280 --> 41:58.336
There's a little
discoloration there.

I know what you're gonna say.

You're right. We're gonna
sue the ATV companies.

This is your fault.

43:03.800 --> 43:04.800
It's not.

43:05.320 --> 43:07.311
If anything,
it's the girls' fault.

43:07.640 --> 43:08.914
They're crazy.

was gonna happen, huh?

43:15.400 --> 43:17.072
What did you think
was gonna happen?

43:17.280 --> 43:18.280
We had a plan.

43:18.440 --> 43:20.829
The plan was
to swim with dolphins...

43:21.000 --> 43:22.672
and eat bananas afterwards.

43:22.840 --> 43:24.736
See, Dad, I'm not gonna
point any fingers here...

43:24.760 --> 43:25.760
but indirectly...

43:25.920 --> 43:27.273
we wouldn't have been on ATVs

43:27.360 --> 43:28.640
if the girls
hadn't forced us to.

43:28.760 --> 43:31.194
And who made us bring dates
in the first place?

43:32.360 --> 43:33.429
Not pointing fingers.
Yeah.

43:33.520 --> 43:35.801
All right. I'm gonna take back
what I said to you earlier.

43:35.920 --> 43:38.036
I am going to
lump you in together.

Poor Jeanie.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.831
Jeanie's special weekend,
and I ruin it.

Hey, hey, hey, Alice?
That was not your fault, okay?

44:09.760 --> 44:11.056
That's two weddings
that I've ruined.

It's just like,
"Stupid Alice!"

Jeanie's face got shredded...

44:15.360 --> 44:16.952
but this is supposed
to be our vacay.

Remember? We're supposed
to be having fun...

44:18.920 --> 44:19.989
and going on adventures.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.195
Get in here with me.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.856
I'm gonna find her.
I'm gonna make it up to her.

to me. Don't leave me!

join your spa day, ladies.

asked or anything,

44:38.640 --> 44:40.870
but you're here. Yay.

44:41.320 --> 44:43.436
What did you guys do
for your bachelorette party?

44:43.720 --> 44:45.560
Did it get crazy?
Did you guys do that thing...

44:45.640 --> 44:46.675
where you go to Vegas

44:46.760 --> 44:48.432
and you dress up
as a prostitute...

44:48.760 --> 44:50.478
and you go out
and there's a contest...

44:50.560 --> 44:52.755
to see who can get
the most money from a john...

44:53.040 --> 44:54.936
but then you tell him,
"I'm an undercover cop"...

44:54.960 --> 44:56.416
and they, like,
beg that you don't tell

44:56.440 --> 44:57.953
their children
and their wives...

44:58.120 --> 44:59.235
and they piss themselves,

44:59.320 --> 45:00.880
and you've got
the whole thing on video.

45:00.960 --> 45:02.393
And then you put it on YouTube

45:02.480 --> 45:03.993
and then there's
the Auto-Tune remix.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.160
Did you do that thing?

45:05.840 --> 45:06.909
No.
No.

45:07.240 --> 45:11.756
I didn't actually end up
having one, so...

45:11.920 --> 45:13.640
Why? Every bride
needs a bachelorette party.

45:13.760 --> 45:15.876
I'm sorry Cabo didn't
work out, Jeanie.

45:15.960 --> 45:17.473
I know. It's fine.

45:17.560 --> 45:18.656
You know I couldn't get
the time off work.

45:18.680 --> 45:19.776
And it would have
ruined it for you,

45:19.800 --> 45:21.028
down there without me.

45:21.120 --> 45:22.376
Is there some tension
about this?

45:22.400 --> 45:23.656
So I just thought,
"Let's cancel the whole trip,"

45:23.680 --> 45:24.999
if that makes sense.

45:25.080 --> 45:27.136
Jeanie, can you keep it down?
On the phone with Tokyo.

45:27.160 --> 45:28.296
Did I bring up
something uncomfortable?

45:28.320 --> 45:30.629
Also, I caught the shingles
because it was so stressful.

you feeling, Jeanie?

45:56.320 --> 45:57.799

to disrobe.

my best friend in there...

46:06.960 --> 46:07.976
and she's getting
married tomorrow,

46:08.000 --> 46:09.149
and she's a little uptight.

46:09.440 --> 46:11.749
And I was wondering
if you could, um,

46:11.840 --> 46:14.559
help her let loose
a little bit?

46:14.720 --> 46:15.755
You know?

46:15.840 --> 46:20.868
Give her the "Hawaii Five Oh"
experience?

you know?

but a wink-wink, nudge-nudge?

Are you okay?
Yeah.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.192

had a bit of a fit.

what you're trying to say.

46:37.680 --> 46:38.795
Great.

46:38.880 --> 46:39.880
But I figured it out.

46:39.960 --> 46:41.480
You didn't really
communicate it to me.

46:41.560 --> 46:42.560
Okay, that's fair.

46:42.640 --> 46:46.474

"Who is this for,
me or my family?"

47:19.760 --> 47:22.194
Yeah. I've recently had
an injury to my face...

Do I make a shit-ton of money,
like, way more than Mike?

49:27.160 --> 49:28.479
Yes. But it's like, who cares?

49:28.640 --> 49:30.710
Do I get backstage tickets
to Rihanna?

49:30.960 --> 49:33.520
Do I have a glass blowing
studio in my basement?

49:33.600 --> 49:35.591
Hold up, backstage
tickets to Rihanna?

49:35.760 --> 49:37.671
Yeah, she likes to
have me around. You know.

49:37.840 --> 49:39.592
RiRi is Alice's jam.

49:39.680 --> 49:40.749
Oh, RiRi, is it?

49:40.840 --> 49:41.875
Yes.
That's funny.

49:42.080 --> 49:43.256
She would freak out
if I got her

49:43.280 --> 49:44.508
backstage tickets
to Rihanna.

49:44.680 --> 49:46.238
Well, you could
get her tickets.

49:46.320 --> 49:47.799
From me. I'm right here.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.353
Are you serious?

49:49.520 --> 49:51.397
Oh, God, steam rooms
just open up

49:51.480 --> 49:52.833
your pores, you know?

49:53.480 --> 49:55.516
They open up everything.

49:58.680 --> 50:02.878
Backstage at RiRi is very fun.
Sometimes she plays the DJ.

50:02.960 --> 50:04.473
You know,
just scratching records.

50:04.560 --> 50:05.629
You know like...

(IMITATES RECORD SCRATCHING)

50:10.080 --> 50:11.752
Shit, man. That's...

50:12.160 --> 50:15.232
Are you saying you want me to
get in there for the tickets?

50:15.320 --> 50:18.039
No. No, no, no. No.

50:18.880 --> 50:20.552
(WHISPERS) Yes.

to my sister?

50:41.160 --> 50:42.195

Oh, sure. Oh, sure.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.831
So, are we, like,
close, or...

51:05.520 --> 51:07.760
Let's put the washing machine
on spin cycle. There we go.

Shut the fuck up, Mike.

51:39.840 --> 51:43.037
Well, thank you so much.

51:43.600 --> 51:45.158
Um, I definitely needed this.

51:45.320 --> 51:48.118
I know. Bring this gift
into your marriage.

51:48.680 --> 51:51.194
All you need
is load-bearing ribbons.

51:51.280 --> 51:52.349
Okay.

51:52.520 --> 51:53.953
And a reinforced ceiling.

51:54.040 --> 51:55.040
Oh.

51:55.080 --> 51:56.354
I should warn you...

51:56.480 --> 52:00.519
you may experience some
aftershock orgasms.

52:00.800 --> 52:01.994
Oh.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.832
So, I wouldn't operate
any heavy machinery

52:03.920 --> 52:05.319
for a couple weeks.

52:05.480 --> 52:08.074
That is not a euphemism
for penis. I mean like...

52:08.240 --> 52:10.356
tractors, cranes...

52:10.560 --> 52:12.710
Okay.
...big boats.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.552
Good to know.

52:14.720 --> 52:15.789
Oh, and please hydrate.

52:15.920 --> 52:17.035
Okay.

52:17.200 --> 52:21.273
I cannot stress this enough.
The consequences could be...

52:22.560 --> 52:23.959
You could develop cancer.

52:25.520 --> 52:26.794
You have a very
good friend.

52:32.200 --> 52:34.634
Wait, you did that?

52:35.040 --> 52:37.918
Yeah, well, I felt so bad
about your fucked up face...

52:38.000 --> 52:39.399
and I wanted to
make it up to you.

52:40.040 --> 52:41.359
Aw! Thank you.

52:41.720 --> 52:43.233
Hey, who needs
a bachelorette party

Yeah?

52:47.880 --> 52:49.632

52:49.800 --> 52:52.394
It was like...
He was on ribbons.

52:53.720 --> 52:55.376
I don't know what you did
with Jeanie in the spa...

52:55.400 --> 52:56.958
but she's in a great mood.

52:57.040 --> 52:59.554
Yeah, no problem.
She just needed a release.

52:59.720 --> 53:02.029
Oh, um, I had an idea
for your graphic novel.

53:02.240 --> 53:04.470
I thought you could do
like a Rum character,

53:04.560 --> 53:06.120
who's like Rastafarian,
and he's like...

53:06.440 --> 53:08.510
"I'm Rum Rum,
get in my tum-tum,

53:08.600 --> 53:09.919
"and I play the steel drum."

53:10.040 --> 53:11.075
(IMITATES STEEL DRUM)

53:11.160 --> 53:12.720
"You can rum,
but you cannot hide, mon."

53:12.840 --> 53:15.354
Yeah, that's awesome.
Already, that's so amazing.

53:15.520 --> 53:17.829
No, that's such a good idea.
How did I not think of that?

53:19.880 --> 53:21.154
I think when I get back,

53:21.240 --> 53:23.913
I'm gonna stop
selling liquor with Mike...

53:24.080 --> 53:25.513
and start drawing full time.

53:25.720 --> 53:27.153
Really?
Yeah.

53:27.320 --> 53:28.833
That's amazing.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.069
Do you know how few people

53:30.160 --> 53:31.336
know what they
really wanna do?

53:31.360 --> 53:32.360
But then I think about

53:32.440 --> 53:33.616
what Mike's gonna think
about it all...

53:33.640 --> 53:35.596
and he's gonna
hate that idea.

53:35.760 --> 53:37.478
He's so clingy.

53:37.640 --> 53:38.959
When we were kids,

53:39.040 --> 53:40.439
if I fell asleep
before Mike...

53:40.520 --> 53:42.600
he would always wake me up
so he wouldn't feel alone.

53:42.760 --> 53:44.591
That's kinda sweet.
Yeah.

53:44.760 --> 53:46.398
I don't know. I just...

53:50.200 --> 53:51.553
Do you ever
get that feeling...

53:51.720 --> 53:55.235
that you're not good enough
to get what you really want...

53:55.400 --> 53:57.197
so you're too
scared to try?

53:58.960 --> 54:00.234
All the time.

54:00.960 --> 54:01.960
Really?

54:02.040 --> 54:03.678
Like, all the time.
It's terrifying.

54:03.880 --> 54:05.757
It is, it's terrifying.
Yeah.

54:05.920 --> 54:06.920
You're, like, stuck.

54:07.080 --> 54:08.718
Totally.
Yeah.

54:08.880 --> 54:10.600
Thanks. It's nice
talking to you about this.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.159
Hey, where you going?

54:25.280 --> 54:26.656
Is there a gang bang
in the ballroom

54:26.680 --> 54:27.680
you need to emcee?

54:27.720 --> 54:29.199
Don't be such a drama king.

54:29.320 --> 54:30.992
Yeah,
I'm totally overreacting.

54:31.200 --> 54:32.616
When you invite someone
to a wedding...

54:32.640 --> 54:33.736
they obviously are supposed to

54:33.760 --> 54:34.976
finger diddle
your family members.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
That's common courtesy!

54:36.160 --> 54:38.390
Okay, hold up.
I am a grown-ass woman.

54:38.600 --> 54:40.636
I can finger diddle
whomever I want.

54:40.760 --> 54:41.988
Just because
you say "whomever"

54:42.080 --> 54:43.274
does not make it okay.

54:43.440 --> 54:44.634
It's not a big deal.

54:44.760 --> 54:46.910
It's just like
texting someone.

54:47.160 --> 54:49.071
Oh.
It's just like Tinder.

54:49.240 --> 54:51.800
Swipe right,
swipe right, swipe left.

54:51.880 --> 54:53.711
Swipe left, swipe right.

54:53.800 --> 54:55.597
That's very graphic.
That is...

54:55.680 --> 54:56.999
Rotating your photos.

54:57.080 --> 54:58.798
Expanding them,
contracting them.

54:58.960 --> 55:00.376
Are you deliberately
trying to hurt me?

55:00.400 --> 55:01.515
Is that what you're doing?

55:01.680 --> 55:02.715
What? No!

to get RiRi tickets...

feel better, okay?

55:11.120 --> 55:13.190
You are invited
to my sister's wedding.

55:13.280 --> 55:14.793
You're supposed
to smile, nod...

55:14.960 --> 55:16.188
and do what I
want you to do.

55:16.360 --> 55:17.360
That's the deal.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.752
I thought that
we had a connection.

55:20.360 --> 55:21.360
Like a spark.

55:21.520 --> 55:23.016
You thought you were
gonna bring me here

55:23.040 --> 55:24.439
so that you could
have sex with me.

55:24.800 --> 55:27.234
Yes. No! What? Yeah, right.

55:27.320 --> 55:28.320

Yes, obviously.

55:32.160 --> 55:34.196
You are so hot.
And you smell good.

55:34.360 --> 55:36.256
It's not a weird thing that
I wanna have sex with you...

55:36.280 --> 55:38.236
because you are very sexy...

55:38.400 --> 55:40.516
and you were leading me on,
and we are in Hawaii...

55:40.680 --> 55:42.560
which is a sexy place,
and people have sex here.

55:42.720 --> 55:44.995
God, dude, you built this
all up in your head.

55:45.160 --> 55:47.037

saw you on TV...

55:47.280 --> 55:48.998

Hold up.

I thought you dug me.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.274
Are you even a teacher?

56:09.280 --> 56:10.280
No.

56:10.440 --> 56:11.480
What about little Julio...

56:11.600 --> 56:13.750

who you taught how to read?

56:13.920 --> 56:16.275
Made it up. All of it.

56:17.560 --> 56:18.800
with this guy
name Julio once...

56:18.880 --> 56:20.359
and I'm pretty sure
he couldn't read.

you were Michelle Pfeiffer

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.520
Did you know that
Hitler's parents

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.600
were second cousins?

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.480
Do you have any water?
Put your clothes on!

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.670
I'm a woman, Dave.
Deal with it.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:50.835
(GROANS)

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.629
Because this is the bush
that you came out of.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.153
I didn't come
from that bush.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.992
I came from Mom's bush.
And you know that.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.599
Jeanie! Oh, my God!

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.473
You're completely naked!

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:02.709
Hi, Becky!

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.989
God, your bush
is huge.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.832
You look tall.
No, ma'am.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.395
I told you to stay away
from these bitches.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.830
Alice, seriously,
are you tripping?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
No. God, no.

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.075
Why would say that?

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.496
Just because everything
feels really soft?

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.112
Please.
Just tell me the truth.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.349
Are you on drugs?

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.633
We're super
fucked up. Yeah.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.800
What?

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.880
We started with ecstasy,

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.416
but then I went into
my mystery bags.

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.839
Why the fuck
would you do that?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.194
Don't you
judge me, David.

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.096
I don't think you're supposed
to go into the mystery bag...

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.240
the night before
the wedding.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.656
We brought you here because we
thought you were nice girls.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.511
But Mike was right
about you two.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.875
This whole wedding weekend
is just going to shit!

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.871
Dave, I'll be
honest with you.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.189
I need some clothes.

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.673
I can't continue
to wear this horse.

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.398
Oh, my God.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.233
Oh, the wind feels
so nice.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.628
Come on, come on,
come on.

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.315
(GASPS) We should
go in the ocean.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.470
I'm so thirsty! Dave, we
should get in the ocean.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.757
(SHUSHING) Please, please,
please, just be quiet.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.319
I love this song.

01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:58.753
There's no music playing.

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:00.880
JEANIE: Baby, wait.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.917
Don't worry.
Only our butts touched.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.036
Stop it. Don't freak out
anymore, Pumpkin!

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.236
Don't freak out?
Don't freak out?

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.759
Tell me one thing.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.194
Did you enjoy it?

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.398
No.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.713
That is such a "yes" no.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.835
No.

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.354
I'm gonna ask you again.
Did you enjoy it?

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:19.440
Yes! Oh.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:20.515
Well...

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.352
Cat's out of
the frigging bag, isn't it?

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.431
JEANIE: I went for
a normal massage...

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.640
but Alice, she had asked
for a little special treat.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.816
And then it just kept coming,
and coming, and coming, and...

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:29.880
Who are these
fucking girls

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.376
your brothers brought
to this wedding?

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.960
You are clearly
on drugs.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:35.553
And we're getting
married tomorrow!

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.231
I'm scared, Pumpkin.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.594
Aren't you scared?

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.631
Well, yeah, now I am.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.439
JEANIE: It's just that...

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:48.591
I'm just a little worried
that you are...

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.120
boring.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:53.959
What are you saying?

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.348
You don't want
to marry me?

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:57.800
(CRYING)

01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.314
(BOTH GASP)

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.468
Well...

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.416
No, she doesn't mean that.
She's just confused...

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.776
because she's just rolling
super hard right now.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.949
You rolled her!

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.120
You're the roller!

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.160
I'm so sorry.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.709
I was gonna draw Rum for you.
But not anymore.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.876
(IN JAMAICAN ACCENT)
Everything is not irie, man!

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.914
You've made me so,
so sad.

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:27.833
But a little bit mad.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:29.993
But mostly just sad.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Oh!

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.274
Dad!
Don't!

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:36.833
Mike, for once
in your life...

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.992
please don't say
a fucking word.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.192
I hate them sometimes.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.696
Fucking love them
and they're dicks.

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:09.480
Sometimes I love them,
sometimes I hate them.

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:18.600
Everything okay
over there?

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:21.075
I can't find my other sock.
It's pissing me off.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.718
Did you take
my sock, bro?

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:26.949
No.

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.835
I think you took
my fucking sock, bro.

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.549
God damn it.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.896
I can't believe Jeanie and
Eric aren't getting married...

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.717
and it's all our fault.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:40.358
It's slightly our fault.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.231
It's totally
our fault. Fuck.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.755
We got selfish.
We got distracted.

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:50.158
I don't think we were
#DoingltForJeanie at all.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.197
We weren't
#DoingltForJeanie.

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.509
Our fucking little sister.

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.192
Our little
Jeanie Beanie Weanie.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.757
She is Stanglita.

01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:00.673
The one little girl we used to
let into our Stang Hangs.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:01.840
The Stangle Dangle.

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.433
The smallest plane
in the Stangar.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.749
Don't do it, dude.

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.280
We're supposed to be
her protector.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.913
Don't you cry.

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:09.256
We're supposed to
look out for her.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.429
Stop it.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.033
We're supposed
to be the two dudes

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.519
that have her back
no matter what.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:15.113
If you start,
I'm gonna start.

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.555
We broke up her marriage.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.952
Of course I'm fucking
doing it, man.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.274
We ruined
Jeanie's wedding.

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.873
I'm doing it, too.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.793
(BOTH CRYING)
I hate it.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:28.634
(BAWLING)

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:42.074
Oh, man, we fucked
up this wedding.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:43.160
Yeah.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.510
We fucked it
in the dick.

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:46.800
(GROANS)

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.496
You know I don't like it when you say that.
That's just...

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:51.318
I know, but we fucked it
so hard. Fuck.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.760
I think the reason
we get ourselves

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.552
into so much shit is...

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:55.656
we're always
telling each other

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.680
we're so awesome...

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.992
when we're definitely
not being awesome.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.434
That's deep.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.397
Yeah, you know what?
Um...

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.831
I wanted you
to feel better...

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.150
and get your groove back...

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.471
but not all the way
better to where...

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:15.911
you wouldn't
need me anymore.

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.992
Because if you
don't need me...

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:23.159
then nobody needs me,
and, um...

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.136
Anyway, that's what
I was thinking

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.071
when I was knuckles deep
into Cousin Terry.

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.671
Dude, we're always
gonna need each other.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:31.360
Okay.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.953
Okay, here's the thing.

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.638
I don't wanna
stop being us.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.836
But I think
occasionally...

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:42.272
we should think about how
we make other people feel.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.560
Like Jeanie?

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:46.868
Yeah, like Jeanie.

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:49.038
Oof.
Or like Eric.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.515
Oh, fuck.

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.312
This feels
fucking terrible.

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:54.710
This does not feel good.

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.633
Like, Dave's
so special and...

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.715
He must be
so mad at me.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.195
Poor Mike.

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.710
He's less special,
but I played him so hard.

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.359
They must be
so mad at us!

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.715
They must hate us. Fuck!
I would hate us.

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.677
I would fucking
hate us!

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.195
I hate us, man.
I hate us!

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.475
I hate us, too!

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:17.358
But you're the best, dude.
I love you.

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:19.829
Don't lump yourself
in with me.

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.473
I'm like
a little troll...

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:22.640
who lives
on nothing but

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.392
river water
and squirrel meats.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:26.994
Your drawing? I could never
do anything like that.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:28.229
So go.
You go right now.

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.320
What?

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.469
Go!

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:33.916
Don't let your loser older
brother hold you back.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.753
You are not a loser.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.079
Thanks, Dave.

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.896
Dude, you introduced me
to the Ninja Turtles.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.751
Taught me Donatello
was a pussy.

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.751
That Raphael
was actually dope...

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.911
because he didn't give a
fuck what people thought.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.354
He's cool, but rude.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.748
Exactly.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:52.896
When all those kids
kicked at me

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.016
and they called me
"Moist"...

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.439
you stopped
eating muffins

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.913
at the school lunch
for a year.

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.758
They were too moist.

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:01.757
Made you
an easy target.

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:05.430
You're my brother.
And I love you.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.192
Heroes in a half shell.

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:08.429
Turtle power.

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.360
(YELLS)

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.750
We're not
going anywhere...

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:19.595
until our little sister,
Jeanie Beanie Weanie...

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.478
is getting married.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.360
(YELLS)

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:25.800
(GASPS)

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:28.394
You just killed
the TV.

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.638
I was aiming for it.

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.918
MIKE: We are such idiots.
We are so stupid.

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:37.599
We ruined
your whole wedding...

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.478
and we finally
just realized that.

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:41.596
All right. Please just
stop talking, okay?

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.957
Not another word.
My head hurts so bad.

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.314
Jeanie, Eric.

We can't let you
not get married

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:49.280

fucked everything up.

DAVE: We love you
so much, Jeanie.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.560
We love you, Eric.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.736
We just want you guys
to love each other.

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:53.816

That's it.

not get married.

ALICE: Yeah. Just because
we fucked everything up?

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:02.256
I mean, we want you guys
to love each other.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.280
Love each other.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:05.913
Okay.
This is bizarre,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.319
because we literally
did that...

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.839
BOTH:...exact same thing.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.672
We're even doing
this hand motion.

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:11.989
Yeah, all that
was ours.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.151
The point is, this
shit is all our fault.

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.998
No, it's our fault.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.838
No, it's definitely
our fault.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.115
It is our fault
for sure.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.280
No, no, no. For real.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:21.839
If anything,
it's my fault.

this same paragraph...

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:40.639

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:45.191
But you four fucking morons
keep on fucking with my shit.

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.558
We've only been here
for three minutes...

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:48.800
so those other 17 minutes...

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.074
that's kind of on you...
Mike!

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:51.434
I'm using hyperbole.

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.640
I don't know
what that means,

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.358
and I think you
know that I don't.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.471
Mike, do me a favor.
Shut the fuck up.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:57.560
Go Eric.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.635
Shut up too!

01:22:58.720 --> 01:22:59.994
I mean, God damn it!

01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:03.317
You're all self-absorbed,
barely-functioning...

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:07.554
Yeah.
I know.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:08.696
MIKE: That's pretty spot-on.

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:09.936
ALICE: We just
figured that out.

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.679
Those are not good qualities.
We're gonna work on it.

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.791
It's been a long time.
It's been so many years.

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.438
We're both very confused.

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.676
ALICE: No, no.
You're not confused.

You're just coming
down off MDMA.

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.393
Sorry. Which I gave you.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:23.760
And Eric, you can't blame her

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:25.233
for anything
she said last night.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:28.198
I've done so much
stupid shit on E.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.920
I got so dehydrated that
I was drinking puddle water...

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.400
and I had to go
to the hospital...

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:35.034
'cause puddles
are really dirty.

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.679

I was on peyote...

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.990
and I signed up
for a T-Mobile plan.

TATIANA: One time I got high.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.434
I read the back of a shampoo
bottle for 13 hours.

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:45.629
Because it said "repeat."

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.278
Rinse and repeat.
I get it.

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:50.397
Jeanie, I know you think
that Eric can be boring...

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.279
Enough of this
talk of boring!

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:54.875
Damn it!

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.518
Sixty percent
of my investments

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.114
are in some pretty
aggressive stocks.

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:02.636
I don't always look both ways
when I cross the street.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:05.792
I've been known to have
a second glass of wine...

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.711
with my dinner,
every now and then.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.438
I once went to
see a movie...

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.988
walked across the hallway,
saw a second movie.

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.399
Didn't pay till after.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.749
Is that boring?

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.240
Is that boring?

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:17.469
What'd you say?
Yeah.

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:19.496
You're right. We were wrong.
That was pretty boring.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.760
Well, how about this
for boring?

wanted to go...

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:31.478
so I got these tickets
a while ago to surprise you.

afraid of heights.

terrified of heights.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.749
Yeah.

But my biggest fear...

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.476
is to not be the husband
that you deserve.

JEANIE: Baby, I'm sorry
I fucked so much of this up...

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.520
but I promise
that masseuse...

my lavender juice box.

I want to marry you.

still have me.

about you.

right now...

canceled all the vendors.

to let us get married here.
