01:09.027 --> 01:10.194
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, mate.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.820
Don't worry about it.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.489
You all right?

01:15.366 --> 01:16.742
Enjoy L.A.

02:24.769 --> 02:26.979
- He did it.
- It's all right.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.852
Can you tell me why
everything is always about you?

03:06.936 --> 03:08.395
Everything is not always about me.

03:08.479 --> 03:10.564
That gearhead with his
pocket protector was being sarcastic,

03:10.648 --> 03:12.316
- and you damn well know it.
- "Sarcastic." You know what?

03:12.400 --> 03:14.610
- I'm sorry, I just didn't see it that way.
- Oh, that's bullshit.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.778
What about the dig about
the makeover? That was really nice.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.281
What do you want me to do?
I work with the man, for Christ's sake.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.659
And you know what? You're perfectly
capable of taking care of your own shit.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.787
You know something? The last time
I checked, you were sleeping with me.

03:25.872 --> 03:29.416
So unless you want to start
fucking him, I suggest...

04:24.889 --> 04:28.058
Pal, where can I catch a shuttle
to the airport around here?

04:28.142 --> 04:30.269
- Back there.
- Thanks.

04:41.864 --> 04:45.117
It was him in that gold Lexus
on the cell phone.

04:48.663 --> 04:51.039
Are they still asking
for a change of venue?

04:51.124 --> 04:54.751
He's enhanceable
because of priors in the early '80s.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.966
- Where to?
- Downtown. 312 North Spring Street.

05:01.050 --> 05:02.551
Downtown.

05:06.389 --> 05:10.809
Look, the transcriptions need to be done
by 7 a.m., period, okay?

05:11.644 --> 05:14.855
Hold on.
Take Sepulveda to Slauson to La Brea.

05:14.939 --> 05:18.108
Take La Brea north to Sixth
into downtown.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.861
So what? You'll be up late.

05:20.945 --> 05:23.071
I'm pulling an all-nighter, too,
so save the tears.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.490
I'll take the 105 east to the 110.
That's faster.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.700
What?

05:26.784 --> 05:29.494
I said, the 105 to the 110,
that'll get you there quicker.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.080
The 110 turns into a parking lot
around USC.

05:32.165 --> 05:36.251
But once you get to La Brea north
of Santa Monica, then it's jammed.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.627
The 110 north of the 10,

05:37.712 --> 05:40.756
you get people driving to Pasadena,
and they drive slow.

05:40.840 --> 05:45.218
Yeah, they do, but what I do is
I get off on Grand, and then I...

05:46.637 --> 05:50.432
Hey, surface roads is what you want,
that's what we'll do.

05:53.644 --> 05:56.772
- Are we taking bets?
- Are we?

05:56.856 --> 05:58.482
But what if you're wrong?

05:58.566 --> 06:02.861
I don't think I'm gonna be wrong,
but if I am, the ride's free.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.159
Okay, you got yourself a deal.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.976
Go ahead, say it.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.603
- Say what?
- Go ahead.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.522
Oh, I got lucky with the lights.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.774
You weren't lucky with the lights.
What you were was right.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.567
I was wrong.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.571
Max.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.040
You mind turning that up?

06:57.125 --> 07:01.503
- You like the classics.
- I do. I used to play in high school.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.005
- Let me guess. Woodwinds.
- No. Strings.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.924
I never had the lungs
for wind instruments.

07:06.008 --> 07:09.344
Could've fooled me by the way
you were unloading on that cell phone.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.346
Different instrument.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.266
You know,
if you had just listened to me,

07:14.350 --> 07:16.435
we'd be all bogged down in traffic
right now.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.520
You would've made yourself
an extra 5 bucks.

07:18.604 --> 07:23.191
Yeah, well, you keep that 5 bucks.
Buy you something special. Go wild.

07:23.317 --> 07:27.529
Really, it's not that... It's not a big deal.
Nothing big here.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.197
Well, how many cabbies do you know

07:29.282 --> 07:31.199
get you into an argument
to save you money?

07:31.284 --> 07:33.201
There were two of us.
I had to kill the other one.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.203
I don't like competition.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.751
Take pride in being good
at what you do?

07:41.836 --> 07:45.797
What, this? Oh, this is...
This is... No, this is part-time.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.467
This is a fill-in job. Pay the bills.

07:48.551 --> 07:52.637
But I will be the best at what I do.
But that's something else.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.894
- What else?
- Just shaping up some things.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.021
Like?

08:02.899 --> 08:03.982
Tell me.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.902
Limo company I'm putting together.
Island Limos.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.655
It's gonna be like an island on wheels.
A cool groove, like a club experience.

08:10.740 --> 08:14.075
When you get to the airport, you're
not gonna wanna get out of my limo.

08:14.202 --> 08:17.245
So I do this part-time
to get my Benz off leases,

08:17.330 --> 08:21.500
staff up, get the right client list.
You know, things like that.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.545
How do you like being a lawyer?

08:27.590 --> 08:29.758
- What are you, psychic?
- Little bit.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.760
There's the dark pinstripe suit.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.011
Elegant, not too flashy.
That rules out advertising.

08:34.096 --> 08:37.097
Plus a top-drawer briefcase
that you live out of.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.769
And the purse. A Bottega.

08:40.895 --> 08:45.273
Anyway, a man gets in my cab
with a sword, I figure he's a sushi chef.

08:46.108 --> 08:49.861
You? Clarence Darrow.

08:49.946 --> 08:53.865
Well, no, not quite.
He worked defense. I'm a prosecutor.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.909
- Big case?
- Yeah.

09:39.161 --> 09:41.538
- Got us here fast.
- Of course.

09:41.664 --> 09:44.291
But you didn't answer my question.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.168
Do you like what you do?

09:48.713 --> 09:50.171
Yeah.

09:53.175 --> 09:54.718
But not today.

09:55.845 --> 09:59.014
No, I do. Like, I can't wait.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.601
I love standing in that courtroom.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.186
At the same time, I get this

10:05.313 --> 10:08.690
clenched-up thing
the night before the first days.

10:09.358 --> 10:11.401
Clenched up? How?

10:24.498 --> 10:27.876
I think I'm gonna lose.
I think the case sucks,

10:28.002 --> 10:30.337
my exhibits aren't in order,
I'm not prepared enough,

10:30.421 --> 10:32.464
people are gonna find out
that I don't know what I'm doing

10:32.548 --> 10:35.383
and I've been running some charade
all these years.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.510
I represent the Department of Justice,

10:37.595 --> 10:40.764
and my opening statement is gonna
fall flat at the most important point,

10:40.890 --> 10:43.391
and the jury's gonna laugh at me.

10:46.937 --> 10:49.731
And then I cry. I don't throw up.

10:49.857 --> 10:53.610
A lot of people throw up.
I have a strong stomach.

10:53.736 --> 10:57.906
And then I pull myself together,
I rewrite my opening statement,

10:58.032 --> 11:01.826
work my exhibits, and that's what I do
for the rest of the night.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.745
That's my routine.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.918
In the morning, it starts, and I'm fine.

11:11.462 --> 11:12.921
You need a vacation.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.964
I just had a vacation
on the Harbor Freeway.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.051
No, no, not in a cab. I mean,
you need to get your head straight.

11:18.135 --> 11:21.638
Get your unified self up.
Get harmonic. You know...

11:21.764 --> 11:23.181
When was the last time
you took a break?

11:23.265 --> 11:24.766
I go on a vacation all the time.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.310
- How often?
- A dozen times a day.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.270
My favorite spot.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.315
Maldives Island.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.820
It's my own private getaway.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.698
Things get heavy for me,
I take five minutes out,

11:39.782 --> 11:42.117
and I just go there.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.286
And I just concentrate
on absolutely nothing.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.796
- Here. Take it.
- Oh, no. I couldn't do that.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.841
Take it. Take it, because you need it
a lot more than I do.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.510
And it'll help you. I guarantee it.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.151
Thanks, Max.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.570
Go get 'em.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.350
Hey.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.859
I don't know,

12:57.943 --> 13:03.281
in case you ever wanna investigate
a Fortune 500 company or

13:05.367 --> 13:07.202
argue cab routes.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.644
Hey.

14:18.774 --> 14:22.443
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Hey, yeah. Come on, man, I'm sorry.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.780
I didn't hear you, man. Come on.
I'll take you.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.205
- Where to?
- 1039 South Union Street.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.374
Gotcha.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.851
- How long you think this'll take?
- Seven minutes.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.896
Seven. Not eight? Not six?

14:58.772 --> 15:00.648
Two minutes to get across the 110
to Normandie.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.233
Normandie to Venice, three minutes.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.861
Over to Union is one.
Plus one for "shit happens."

15:04.987 --> 15:06.905
- Okay if I time you?
- Knock yourself out.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.740
What do I get if you're wrong?
A free ride?

15:08.824 --> 15:11.618
You get an apology.
I already offered my free ride today.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.703
- To who?
- Some girl.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.248
Did you get a date with her?

15:18.042 --> 15:20.960
- First time in L.A.?
- No.

15:21.045 --> 15:25.298
Tell you the truth, whenever I'm here,
I can't wait to leave.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.842
Too sprawled out, disconnected.
You know.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.887
- That's me. You like it?
- It's my home.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.805
Seventeen million people.
This was a country,

15:32.890 --> 15:36.726
it'd be the fifth biggest economy in the
world, and nobody knows each other.

15:36.852 --> 15:40.271
I read about this guy,
gets on the MTA here, dies.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.149
Six hours he's riding the subway

15:43.233 --> 15:46.194
before anybody notices his corpse
doing laps around L.A.,

15:46.278 --> 15:49.030
people on and off sitting next to him.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.698
Nobody notices.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.623
This is the cleanest cab
I've ever been in.

15:58.707 --> 16:02.251
- Regular ride?
- Yeah, I share it with the day-shift guy.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.213
- Because you prefer nights?
- Yeah, people are more relaxed.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.674
Less stress, less traffic, better tips.

16:07.758 --> 16:11.761
- How are the benefits?
- Oh, no. It's not that kind of job.

16:11.887 --> 16:14.514
I'm not in this for the long haul.
I'm just filling in, you know.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.975
Just temporary while I'm getting
some things shaped up.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.434
This is just temporary.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.145
- How long you been driving?
- Twelve years.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.730
Really?

16:23.649 --> 16:26.234
What other things you putting together?

16:31.323 --> 16:35.535
You know, I don't wanna talk about it.
Just a little business plan.

16:35.619 --> 16:38.788
- No offense. I just...
- None taken.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.542
You're one of these guys that do
instead of talk.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.127
That's cool.

16:51.260 --> 16:55.763
- Seven minutes. Man, you're good.
- I got lucky with the lights.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.600
Yeah, sure. You probably know
the light schedules, too.

16:59.685 --> 17:04.021
Listen, I'm in town on a real-estate deal,
close in one night.

17:04.106 --> 17:07.358
I got five stops to make.
Collect signatures, see some friends,

17:07.443 --> 17:11.069
and then I got a 6:00 a.m. out of LAX.
Why don't you hang with me?

17:11.155 --> 17:13.281
The car's not for hire, man.
That's against regs.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.616
- Regulations?
- Yeah.

17:15.701 --> 17:19.454
These guys don't pay you sick leave.
How much you pull down a shift?

17:19.538 --> 17:21.329
- How much?
- 350, 400.

17:21.457 --> 17:25.042
Yeah? Well, let me tell you what.
I'll make it 600.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.213
- Man, I don't know.
- Plus an extra hundred

17:29.298 --> 17:31.382
you get me to LAX
and I don't have to run for the plane.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.134
Oh, no, guy. I don't know about this.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.594
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you do.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.804
- Man, I don't know, man.
- Yeah, you do.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.389
Six hundred...

17:38.474 --> 17:40.933
Cool. We got a deal.
Now, here's 300 down.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.685
- What's your name?
- Max.

17:42.811 --> 17:45.521
- Max. I'm Vincent.
- All right.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.986
I can't stay double-parked here, though.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.529
I'll meet you in the alley
behind the building.

17:53.655 --> 17:54.822
All right.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.674
Definitely not from around here.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.612
There you go.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.404
Oh, no! Shit! Fuck!

19:21.160 --> 19:22.702
What the fuck?

19:22.786 --> 19:25.454
What the hell? Damn it!

19:26.748 --> 19:28.457
My man, you all right?

19:28.584 --> 19:30.501
Oh, shit. Fuck.

19:36.091 --> 19:38.176
He... He fell on the cab.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.972
He fell... He fell from up there
on the motherfucking cab.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.808
- Shit. I think he's dead.
- Good guess.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.234
You killed him?

19:55.319 --> 19:58.613
No, I shot him.
Bullets and the fall killed him.

20:00.657 --> 20:02.742
Oh, man. Fuck this, man.

20:02.826 --> 20:05.453
- Red light, Max.
- Hold on. Hold on.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.122
Put your hands down.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.833
- Put your hands down.
- Okay. Okay.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.422
Okay, help me out. Pop the trunk.

20:16.506 --> 20:19.467
- What?
- Pop the trunk.

20:20.469 --> 20:24.639
Come on, man. Come on. Come on.
What you... What you doing?

20:24.723 --> 20:26.265
I'm gonna roll him off the roof.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.975
- Huh?
- Can't leave him here.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.187
So unless you want him up front
with you, but given the hygiene...

20:31.313 --> 20:33.314
- Oh, shit.
- Okay.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.733
It's only a dead guy.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.526
Grab his hands.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.821
- I can't do this.
- Grab his wrists.

20:44.368 --> 20:47.411
- You got it?
- Yeah. He's twitching and shit.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.014
Okay. That's good enough.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.897
- Let's go.
- Hey, why don't you just take the cab?

21:15.023 --> 21:16.941
- Take the cab?
- Yeah, you take it.

21:17.025 --> 21:20.361
I'll chill. I'll just chill.
They don't even know who's driving

21:20.445 --> 21:23.114
these things half the time anyway, man.
They never check or anything.

21:23.198 --> 21:26.325
Okay? So just take it. You, me...

21:26.410 --> 21:27.868
You promise not to tell anybody, right?

21:27.953 --> 21:30.037
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

21:31.206 --> 21:32.915
Promise.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.001
- Get in the fucking car.
- You... You...

21:35.085 --> 21:36.711
Get in the car.

22:52.996 --> 23:02.505
Ramone?

23:17.354 --> 23:31.992
Ramone!

23:55.392 --> 23:56.600
Fuck.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.864
- Rampart watch commander.
- This is Detective Fanning, Narcotics.

24:09.948 --> 24:14.535
Send two black-and-whites and
a night detective to 1039 South Union.

24:14.619 --> 24:19.123
- And contact SID. I got a crime scene.
- Roger. 1039 South Union.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.637
- What are you doing?
- I got to clean it up. It's a mess.

24:33.722 --> 24:37.183
So? Lady Macbeth, we're sitting here,
and the light's green.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.976
Leave the seats.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.732
Asshole!

24:47.444 --> 24:49.403
You no longer have
the cleanest cab in la-la land.

24:49.488 --> 24:53.115
You gotta live with that.
You focus on the job. Drive.

24:55.619 --> 24:59.705
- 7565 Fountain. You know it?
- West Hollywood.

24:59.789 --> 25:03.292
- How long you figure?
- I don't know, man, 17 minutes.

25:05.086 --> 25:06.253
Why?

25:06.755 --> 25:08.756
Oh, no. No, no, no. Hold on, man.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.633
Now, I told you
we had other stops to make tonight.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.718
No, you said
you had to go visit some friends.

25:12.802 --> 25:14.762
- Well, they're somebody's friends.
- No.

25:14.846 --> 25:18.724
You drive a cab, I make my rounds,

25:18.808 --> 25:21.435
you might make it through the night,
come out 700 bucks ahead.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.230
I'm not trying to piss you off,
or nothing like that, but I can't do this.

25:24.314 --> 25:26.649
I can't drive you around
while you go around killing people, man.

25:26.775 --> 25:29.568
- It ain't my job.
- Tonight it is.

25:29.653 --> 25:33.364
Look, you don't get it.
I mean it. I mean it.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.824
I'm... I'm not up for this.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.911
- Okay, hey, hey, hey. You're stressed.
- Yes, I am.

25:38.995 --> 25:41.330
You're stressed. Now, I understand that.

25:41.456 --> 25:44.959
Now, you just keep breathing
and stay calm.

25:45.710 --> 25:46.835
- Are you breathing?
- Shit.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.003
- Are you breathing?
- Yes.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.547
Okay, good.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.970
Okay, look, here's the deal.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.681
Man, you were gonna drive me
around tonight and never be the wiser,

25:58.807 --> 26:03.018
but El Gordo got in front of a window,
did his high dive.

26:03.144 --> 26:05.854
We're into plan B. You still breathing?

26:06.690 --> 26:09.817
Now, we gotta make the best of it.
Improvise. Adapt to the environment.

26:09.901 --> 26:13.445
Darwin. Shit happens. I Ching.
Whatever, man. We gotta roll with it.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.699
I Ching. What are you talking about,
man? You threw a man out of a window.

26:16.825 --> 26:19.285
I didn't throw him. He fell.

26:19.369 --> 26:22.913
- Well, what did he do to you?
- What?

26:22.998 --> 26:26.709
- What did he do to you?
- Nothing. I only met him tonight.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.670
You just met him once,
and you kill him like that?

26:29.754 --> 26:32.006
What, I should only kill people
after I get to know them?

26:32.090 --> 26:35.509
- No, man.
- Max, six billion people on the planet,

26:35.594 --> 26:37.678
you're getting bent out of shape
because of one fat guy.

26:37.762 --> 26:41.015
- Well, who was he?
- What do you care?

26:41.099 --> 26:43.517
- Have you ever heard of Rwanda?
- Yes, I know Rwanda.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.936
Tens of thousands
killed before sundown.

26:46.021 --> 26:49.189
Nobody's killed people that fast
since Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

26:49.274 --> 26:50.858
- Did you bat an eye, Max?
- What?

26:50.942 --> 26:53.694
Did you join Amnesty International,
Oxfam,

26:53.778 --> 26:57.031
Save the Whale,
Greenpeace or something? No.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.783
I off one fat Angeleno,
and you throw a hissy fit.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.452
Man, I don't know any Rwandans.

27:01.536 --> 27:03.787
You don't know the guy
in the trunk, either.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.247
Man.

27:06.791 --> 27:09.335
Okay, if it makes you feel any better,
he was a criminal

27:09.419 --> 27:12.171
involved in a continuing
criminal enterprise.

27:12.255 --> 27:14.256
What are you doing?
You just taking out the garbage?

27:14.382 --> 27:16.216
Yeah. Something like that.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.636
- Pull over to the right.
- Shit.

27:21.097 --> 27:23.182
- Get rid of them.
- How?

27:23.266 --> 27:26.393
You're a cabby.
Talk yourself out of a ticket.

27:31.107 --> 27:32.733
Just, please, man, don't do anything.

27:32.817 --> 27:35.861
Then don't let me get cornered.
You don't have the trunk space.

27:35.945 --> 27:37.863
- I can't believe this.
- Believe it.

27:37.947 --> 27:40.074
Don't. I'll talk to them.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.287
He's probably married.

27:45.997 --> 27:49.583
The other one has kids.
Probably his wife's pregnant.

27:49.668 --> 27:54.004
Yeah, I'll take care of it. I got it.
I'll deal with it. Yeah. Just a second.

27:55.757 --> 27:56.924
- How you doing?
- Hey.

27:57.008 --> 27:59.051
Hey, my partner's gonna help you out
on that side over there.

27:59.135 --> 28:01.095
License, registration.

28:01.596 --> 28:02.805
Yeah.

28:06.351 --> 28:10.020
I'm pulling you over
because your windshield's smashed.

28:11.606 --> 28:14.024
- All this current?
- Yes, Officer.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.695
Hey, man, what'd you do,
have a food fight in here?

28:17.779 --> 28:21.657
Yeah, I'll... Pretty messy.
Just clean it up.

28:23.118 --> 28:26.370
Hey, is this blood up here
on your windshield?

28:26.454 --> 28:27.871
Yeah.

28:28.790 --> 28:31.125
Yeah, I hit a deer.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.628
- You hit a deer?
- Yeah, over on...

28:36.131 --> 28:39.049
- I was on Slauson.
- A South Central deer?

28:40.885 --> 28:42.511
Yeah, they out there. They...

28:42.637 --> 28:45.055
It ran right in front of the car
and I couldn't avoid it.

28:45.140 --> 28:49.685
- Why you still carrying a passenger?
- I was on my way to the depot and...

28:49.811 --> 28:52.229
I could just drop him.
His drop is on my way.

28:52.313 --> 28:55.190
Yeah, but your cab's unsafe to drive,
and we have to impound it,

28:55.316 --> 28:57.776
so we gotta do a vehicle inventory
before the tow truck gets here.

28:57.861 --> 28:59.862
So pop the trunk
and step out the vehicle.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.406
Sir, I'm sorry, but you're gonna
have to call another cab.

29:02.490 --> 29:05.200
Is that really necessary, Officer?
I'm just a half a mile from here.

29:05.326 --> 29:07.745
Yes, sir, I'm afraid it is.
Please, step out the vehicle.

29:07.829 --> 29:10.831
- You, too. Come on.
- lf you open that trunk, they go inside.

29:10.915 --> 29:14.001
You know what, man,
it's been a long night.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.462
Plus, the barn is right up there,
you know.

29:16.546 --> 29:18.922
Just give me a break.
This is my first fare.

29:19.007 --> 29:21.925
Get out the cab. Open the trunk.
Come on.

29:24.345 --> 29:26.764
Step out. You, too, sir. Please.

29:27.682 --> 29:32.436
This is Rampart Division dispatch.
Shots fired at 83rd and Hoover.

29:33.354 --> 29:35.522
All available Precinct 26 units respond.
Over.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.358
- Hey, partner, we gotta roll.
- Roger. En route.

29:38.443 --> 29:41.779
Go straight to the garage.
Have a nice night, sir.

30:03.551 --> 30:04.927
Stop here.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.663
Hands on the wheel, 10 and 2.

30:32.747 --> 30:35.082
- Why?
- Because I say so.

30:46.302 --> 30:47.678
- Max. Max.
- Shit.

30:47.762 --> 30:50.305
You out there, you son of a bitch?

30:51.850 --> 30:55.269
- Who is that?
- That's Lenny. Just dispatch.

30:57.605 --> 31:00.148
Max, I know you're out there.
Answer the goddamn call.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.985
- What happens if you don't?
- He just keeps calling me.

31:03.111 --> 31:04.778
Max, answer.

31:10.201 --> 31:11.785
Don't blow it.

31:14.455 --> 31:17.374
- Yeah, Lenny, what's up? It's me.
- Just got off the phone with the cops.

31:17.458 --> 31:21.336
Desk sergeant called to check
you brought the cab in.

31:21.462 --> 31:24.298
- Yeah, so?
- So aside from I hate talking to cops,

31:24.382 --> 31:26.758
they tell me
you crashed the goddamn cab?

31:26.843 --> 31:30.262
No. No, I got crashed into. I didn't...

31:30.346 --> 31:33.390
Do I care what, where or why?
You're paying.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.608
It was an accident. You're not liable.

31:42.692 --> 31:45.277
It was an accident. I'm not liable.

31:45.361 --> 31:48.196
Bullshit. I'm making you liable.
It's coming out of your goddamn pocket.

31:48.323 --> 31:50.073
You tell him to stick this cab
up his fat ass.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.326
- I can't do that. That's my boss.
- So?

31:52.410 --> 31:54.828
- I need my job.
- No, you don't.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.790
You still there? I'm talking to you.
Max! Max!

31:58.875 --> 32:02.669
- He's not paying you a damn thing.
- Who the hell is this?

32:07.175 --> 32:08.967
Albert Riccardo,
Assistant U.S. Attorney,

32:09.052 --> 32:11.720
a passenger in this cab,
and I'm reporting you to the DMV.

32:11.846 --> 32:13.889
- Let's not get excited.
- Not get excited?

32:14.015 --> 32:15.515
How am I supposed to not get excited,

32:15.600 --> 32:17.601
listening to you
try to extort a working man?

32:17.685 --> 32:19.394
You know goddamn well
your collision policy

32:19.520 --> 32:22.022
and general-liability umbrella
will cover the damages.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.650
Now, what are you trying to pull,
you sarcastic prick?

32:24.734 --> 32:26.693
- I was just trying to...
- Tell it to him.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.696
Here, tell him he's an asshole.
Go ahead.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.782
You're an asshole.

32:31.866 --> 32:33.408
Tell him he pulls this shit again,

32:33.534 --> 32:36.870
you're gonna
stick this yellow cab up his fat ass.

32:38.122 --> 32:41.416
And next time you pull any shit, I'm...

32:41.542 --> 32:45.253
I'm gonna have to stick
this yellow cab up your fat ass.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.229
Shit!

33:02.313 --> 33:05.524
Things like protective orders,
because you think of domestic stalking

33:05.608 --> 33:08.610
where a husband wants his wife back
or boyfriend-girlfriend kind of thing.

33:08.736 --> 33:11.238
We always hear,
"Get your protective order."

33:11.322 --> 33:13.699
Well, a protective order's
a tool that we use,

33:13.783 --> 33:17.119
but oftentimes, it's just
a piece of paper to the stalker.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.370
Yeah.

33:18.454 --> 33:20.247
Mr. Clarke, there's a notary here
to see you.

33:20.331 --> 33:21.999
Well, did he identify himself
as a notary?

33:22.083 --> 33:23.917
Yes, he did.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.336
All right, sure, send him up.

33:26.421 --> 33:29.256
Or shoots them, you know?
That happens all too often.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.758
- But we use it as a tool.
- Yeah, a lot of times, though...

33:31.843 --> 33:36.096
I say a lot of times... In this situation,
strangers may write or call.

33:36.180 --> 33:39.141
But how often, in fact, are stalkers

33:39.267 --> 33:43.353
people that the recipient
of those attentions knows?

33:53.990 --> 33:56.324
Hey! Hey, I'm in the cab!

33:57.285 --> 33:58.452
Hey!

33:59.787 --> 34:02.622
Shit. Down here in the... In the alley!

34:03.666 --> 34:04.958
Shit!

34:11.799 --> 34:13.300
Hey, hold up.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.684
Oh, man, yeah. Hey, yeah, right there.

34:22.810 --> 34:26.313
I'm in the cab, man, I'm stuck.
Thank you. Thank you.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.984
Hey, man.
Hey, look, I gotta get out of here.

34:31.194 --> 34:33.445
- What's up, man? What's going on?
- Look, I'm tied up in here.

34:33.529 --> 34:35.530
This guy tied me up,
but he's up in this building,

34:35.656 --> 34:37.991
wreaking havoc, doing some wild shit.
I need to get out of here.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.743
- You all tied up in there, huh?
- Yeah, I'm trapped,

34:39.827 --> 34:41.620
so just get me out of here
so we can call the cops.

34:41.704 --> 34:43.330
Why don't you give me
your fucking wallet?

34:43.414 --> 34:47.000
- Are you kidding me?
- Do I look like I'm kidding you?

34:47.668 --> 34:51.254
Listen, don't you see that my hands
are tied to the steering wheel?

34:51.339 --> 34:54.841
I don't give a damn what they're tied to.
I'll fuck you up.

34:54.926 --> 34:57.761
- Don't shoot, man.
- Then get your ass up.

34:57.845 --> 34:59.346
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

35:00.264 --> 35:03.767
What the fuck else you got in here?
Jackpot.

35:06.187 --> 35:08.021
That was for real.

35:16.531 --> 35:17.906
Yo, homey.

35:20.743 --> 35:21.993
That my briefcase?

35:22.078 --> 35:25.705
This your briefcase? Yeah, it is.
Why, you want it back?

35:25.790 --> 35:27.707
How about your wallet?

35:29.544 --> 35:31.878
What else you got for me, huh?

35:36.384 --> 35:37.592
Fuck!

35:54.277 --> 35:56.987
Where's the button? Under the dash?

36:02.827 --> 36:04.578
Mind getting it?

36:16.841 --> 36:20.552
You attract attention, you're gonna get
people killed who didn't need to be.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.304
You understand?

36:22.430 --> 36:23.930
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

36:32.106 --> 36:36.151
But, hey, new news.
We're ahead of schedule.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.988
- Like jazz?
- Sorry, what?

36:40.573 --> 36:43.825
- Jazz. You like jazz?
- Not that much.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.288
Guy told me about this place
off Crenshaw.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.957
Leimert Park.
All the West Coast greats played there.

36:51.042 --> 36:55.670
Dexter Gordon, Charlie Mingus,
Chet Baker. Like that.

36:57.256 --> 36:59.925
Come on, finish up. Buy you a drink.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.480
This informant of yours,
what's his name? Ramone?

37:13.564 --> 37:16.942
Ramone Ayala. Supposed to meet him
in Bellflower last night.

37:17.026 --> 37:19.653
He doesn't show up,
I roll here, find this.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.405
Yeah, how long
you been working this guy?

37:22.490 --> 37:24.282
Four months. He's a low-level player.

37:24.367 --> 37:27.494
Part of a distribution network
that hooks up to Felix.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.496
Felix Reyes-Torrena?

37:29.580 --> 37:32.082
Feds are all over him.
They don't want us anywhere near it.

37:32.166 --> 37:34.542
Since when's LAPD
working for the Feeb?

37:34.627 --> 37:37.128
If they're into it,
they're just gonna take all our stuff,

37:37.213 --> 37:39.673
build their case, take all the credit.
So what is the point?

37:39.757 --> 37:41.841
The point is, is my guy
flew out a window.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.551
So if my CI flies out a window,

37:43.636 --> 37:46.429
then he's got Felix's handprints
on his ass.

37:46.514 --> 37:47.973
That makes it mine.

37:48.057 --> 37:51.977
Is there a crime here? A homicide?
You got a body?

37:53.271 --> 37:55.730
- I just see a bunch of broken glass.
- And blood.

37:55.815 --> 37:59.067
Down here, in the glass.
Here's some more.

37:59.151 --> 38:03.154
And there's some spatter patterns
over there and over here.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.365
- Richard?
- Yeah, it's me.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.625
Ramone went through that window,
splat.

38:17.503 --> 38:20.255
Glass here, then tires rolled over it.

38:21.173 --> 38:22.841
- Maybe he jumped.
- Sure.

38:22.925 --> 38:26.428
He's depressed, so he jumps four
stories out of a window onto his head.

38:26.512 --> 38:28.388
"Wow, that feels better."
Picks himself up.

38:28.472 --> 38:31.933
"Now I think I'll go on
with the rest of my day."

38:32.018 --> 38:34.978
- Come on, man.
- Hey, Ray! Catch.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.360
- Recent?
- You can still smell the cordite.

38:43.612 --> 38:45.947
Old guy across the alley
watching late-night TV

38:46.032 --> 38:48.033
says he saw a cab parked here
earlier tonight

38:48.117 --> 38:50.577
with two guys walking around the hood.

38:50.661 --> 38:52.245
Description? He see anything?

38:52.330 --> 38:55.290
Kind of saw.
Guy's got glasses like Coke bottles.

38:55.374 --> 38:57.917
There are 4,000 taxicabs in L.A. County.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.086
- You got anything else?
- That's it.

39:00.171 --> 39:03.923
Okay. Keep knocking.
Let's keep knocking.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.426
Remember that Bay Area deal?
Oakland?

39:06.510 --> 39:09.054
Cabby drove around all night,
killed three people,

39:09.138 --> 39:11.931
- then put the gun to his head.
- Yeah, the guy flipped out. So what?

39:12.016 --> 39:14.768
So that Oakland P.D. detective,
what's-his-name, he never bought it.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.937
Cabby had no criminal record,
no history of mental illness.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.482
Pops three people, then himself?

39:21.901 --> 39:26.571
Anyway, that detective always thought
there was someone else in that cab.

39:57.186 --> 39:59.771
I never learned to listen to jazz.

40:01.148 --> 40:05.318
It's off melody. Behind the notes.
Not what's expected.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.530
- Improvising, like tonight.
- Like tonight?

40:33.305 --> 40:35.390
Most people, 10 years from now,

40:35.474 --> 40:37.892
same job, same place, same routine,
everything the same.

40:37.977 --> 40:40.687
Just keeping it safe
over and over and over.

40:40.771 --> 40:42.605
Ten years from now.

40:43.107 --> 40:46.818
Man, you don't know where you'll be
10 minutes from now.

40:47.653 --> 40:48.903
Do you?

41:04.336 --> 41:08.590
- Who is that on the trumpet?
- That's Daniel, baby. He's the owner.

41:10.342 --> 41:14.012
He's terrific. Would you be so kind
as to invite him over after his set?

41:14.096 --> 41:17.307
- I gotta buy him a drink.
- Sure thing, darling.

41:24.690 --> 41:28.776
No, now, see, I was about 19,
bussing tables right here.

41:28.861 --> 41:31.696
The money wasn't shit,
but that wasn't the point.

41:31.780 --> 41:34.616
It was about being around the music.
And I was.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.284
I mean, take this one night.

41:36.368 --> 41:39.579
July 22nd, 1964.
Who you think walks through that door?

41:39.663 --> 41:41.372
Bye, baby.

41:41.457 --> 41:43.875
Miles Davis. That's right.

41:43.959 --> 41:45.168
- In the flesh?
- That's right.

41:45.252 --> 41:48.630
I'm talking about, through those doors,
the coolest man on the planet.

41:48.714 --> 41:50.006
Jesus.

41:50.090 --> 41:52.634
Anyway, he had been
at a recording session

41:52.718 --> 41:56.721
up at Columbia, up on Vine.
So Miles comes through that door.

41:56.805 --> 42:01.476
Before you know it, he's up on
the bandstand, jamming with the band.

42:01.560 --> 42:04.187
- Well, it had to be...
- Oh, it was scary.

42:04.271 --> 42:06.814
I mean, the dude was so focused, man.

42:06.899 --> 42:09.317
Plus, he was kind of
a scary cat anyway, man.

42:09.401 --> 42:10.818
I mean, everybody and their mama knew

42:10.903 --> 42:13.947
that you don't just come up
and talk to Miles Davis.

42:14.031 --> 42:18.451
I mean, he may have looked like
he was chilling, but he was absorbed.

42:18.536 --> 42:22.747
This one young, hip couple, one of them
tried to shake his hand one day.

42:22.831 --> 42:25.833
And the guy says, "Hi, my name is..."

42:25.918 --> 42:28.461
Miles said, "Get the fuck out of my face,
you jive motherfucker.

42:28.546 --> 42:31.089
"Take your silly bitch with you."

42:32.383 --> 42:35.134
You know? That's...
That was Miles, man.

42:35.219 --> 42:39.847
That's the way he was when he was
in his musical headspace. Fierce.

42:39.932 --> 42:41.432
But did you get to talk to him?

42:41.517 --> 42:43.101
- Better than that.
- No.

42:43.185 --> 42:46.771
- I played for about 20 minutes.
- Unbelievable.

42:46.855 --> 42:48.773
- How'd you do?
- How'd I do?

42:48.857 --> 42:51.859
Well, you really ain't shit when
you're playing next to Miles Davis.

42:51.944 --> 42:54.153
But he carried my ass.

42:54.238 --> 42:57.532
- What'd he say?
- He said one word, "Cool."

42:58.158 --> 42:59.534
- "Cool"?
- Yeah.

42:59.618 --> 43:01.119
- That's it?
- Yeah.

43:01.203 --> 43:03.496
That meant, "Good, but not ready."

43:03.581 --> 43:06.249
It meant, "Look me up when you are."

43:06.834 --> 43:08.710
- Did you?
- No.

43:09.587 --> 43:12.714
I got drafted
and got into some other things,

43:12.798 --> 43:17.260
and by the time I got back to music,
the season had passed.

43:18.304 --> 43:21.180
But, you know, I was born in 1945,

43:21.265 --> 43:25.143
but that night was
the moment of my conception.

43:25.227 --> 43:28.354
- Right here in this room.
- Crowd's not here now.

43:28.439 --> 43:31.608
Well, jazz ain't the draw
that it used to be.

43:33.485 --> 43:35.403
What a great story.

43:36.113 --> 43:40.158
I gotta tell the people in Culiacán
and Cartagena that story.

43:53.380 --> 43:56.633
You know the folks in Culiacán
and Cartagena?

43:56.717 --> 43:58.134
Afraid so.

43:59.887 --> 44:02.347
Man, just when I thought
you were a cool guy.

44:02.431 --> 44:05.892
I am a cool guy,
with a job I contracted to do.

44:05.976 --> 44:08.102
Come on, Vincent,
give the dude a pass.

44:08.187 --> 44:09.687
- I'm working here.
- No, listen. You the one

44:09.772 --> 44:11.564
sitting here talking about improvisation.

44:11.649 --> 44:13.524
You like the guy, you like how he plays.

44:13.609 --> 44:16.152
- Let's just play a little jazz. Come on.
- Improv...

44:16.236 --> 44:18.613
That's funny, coming from you.

44:24.286 --> 44:26.871
How's this? I'll ask a question.

44:26.955 --> 44:29.874
- What question?
- A jazz question.

44:30.584 --> 44:33.086
Now, you get it right, we roll.

44:34.421 --> 44:36.381
You disappear tonight.

44:37.174 --> 44:38.966
If I walk out of here tonight,

44:39.051 --> 44:43.054
I will go so far away,
it'll be just like I was dead.

44:43.138 --> 44:44.514
And one more thing.

44:44.598 --> 44:48.226
These people and their rep here, Felix,

44:48.310 --> 44:50.728
well, you tell them I'm sorry.

44:50.813 --> 44:55.566
You tell them I had to.
They laid a grant of immunity on me.

44:55.651 --> 44:58.778
I was compelled.
It was either play ball or go back inside.

44:58.862 --> 45:01.823
And I'm not going back inside.

45:05.077 --> 45:06.369
Yeah.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.416
Lay it on me.

45:12.501 --> 45:14.335
Where did Miles learn music?

45:14.420 --> 45:16.254
I know everything
there is to know about Miles.

45:16.338 --> 45:17.755
Then let's have it.

45:17.840 --> 45:20.967
Music school.
He got into music school, right?

45:21.051 --> 45:23.886
His father was a dentist, East St Louis.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.888
Invested in agriculture,
made plenty of money.

45:25.973 --> 45:29.350
He sent Miles
to Juilliard School of Music,

45:29.435 --> 45:31.769
New York, 1945.

45:31.854 --> 45:33.062
Man.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.370
Dropped out of Juilliard
after less than a year.

45:49.455 --> 45:51.873
Tracked down Charlie Parker
on 52nd Street,

45:51.957 --> 45:54.917
who mentored him
for the next three years.

46:17.399 --> 46:20.902
- Hey.
- No. No, I'm done.

46:20.986 --> 46:22.904
- Find you another cab.
- Max.

46:22.988 --> 46:25.740
Leave me alone. I'm collateral anyway.

46:32.539 --> 46:34.248
I am not playing.

46:36.752 --> 46:38.586
You played him, man.

46:40.088 --> 46:44.008
He got the answer right,
would you have let him go?

46:47.471 --> 46:50.598
This is 102. This is 102. Max?

46:50.682 --> 46:53.309
- What is it with this guy?
- Max?

47:03.403 --> 47:06.239
- You hassling my driver again?
- Who are you?

47:06.323 --> 47:08.866
The same guy you talked to last time.

47:08.951 --> 47:12.370
Max's mother's driving me crazy.
Put him on the line, please.

47:12.454 --> 47:13.830
Hang on.

47:15.082 --> 47:16.499
Carefully.

47:18.627 --> 47:19.752
Yeah.

47:19.837 --> 47:21.295
Your mother's calling every 10 minutes.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.756
Why didn't you show?
Are you all right? Where are you?

47:23.841 --> 47:25.424
Show for what?

47:26.969 --> 47:28.636
Tell her I can't make it tonight.

47:28.720 --> 47:31.097
I'm not related to you.
You tell her yourself.

47:31.181 --> 47:32.890
Show up for what?

47:35.143 --> 47:36.978
She's in the hospital.

47:37.062 --> 47:39.564
- You visit every night?
- Yeah. What difference does it make?

47:39.648 --> 47:42.483
- You don't show up, it breaks routine.
- So?

47:42.568 --> 47:46.404
So people start looking for you, this cab.
That's not good.

47:48.282 --> 47:50.950
I'm not taking you to see my mother.

47:51.785 --> 47:54.704
Since when was any of this negotiable?

48:01.211 --> 48:03.754
Two paces ahead, one to the left.

48:09.219 --> 48:11.137
Hey. Flowers?

48:12.222 --> 48:15.516
It's a waste of money.
Won't mean a thing to her.

48:16.643 --> 48:19.854
She carried you in her womb
for nine months.

48:24.234 --> 48:26.861
People buy flowers. Buy flowers.

48:26.945 --> 48:29.238
Excuse me. Keep the change.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.960
Hold that elevator, please.

48:45.797 --> 48:47.673
- Floor?
- Five. Thanks.

48:59.019 --> 49:02.521
- Having a good night?
- Maso maso. You?

49:11.865 --> 49:13.240
Excuse me.

49:47.567 --> 49:48.901
Hey, Ma.

49:50.946 --> 49:54.323
- I've been calling and calling.
- Yeah, well, I got caught up at work.

49:54.408 --> 49:56.492
Why couldn't you call me
on the telephone?

49:56.576 --> 49:59.412
I'm lying here wondering
if something terrible happened to you.

49:59.496 --> 50:00.788
I brought you flowers.

50:00.872 --> 50:03.249
- What am I gonna do with flowers?
- Cheer up.

50:03.333 --> 50:04.625
How?

50:04.710 --> 50:09.588
By worrying that you spend money
on stuff that's just gonna wilt and die?

50:09.673 --> 50:11.382
See what I mean?

50:11.466 --> 50:13.551
I didn't buy you the flowers, Mom.
He did.

50:13.635 --> 50:14.885
Who?

50:19.891 --> 50:22.643
Why didn't you tell me
we had company?

50:24.646 --> 50:28.274
What's your name?
Sorry my son is rude.

50:28.358 --> 50:30.484
No harm done, ma'am.

50:30.569 --> 50:33.070
You paid for my flowers?

50:33.155 --> 50:34.947
They're beautiful.

50:43.248 --> 50:44.665
Well, Max?

50:48.462 --> 50:52.256
Mother, this is Vincent.
Vincent, this is my mother, Ida.

50:55.385 --> 50:57.678
I'm very happy to meet you,
Mrs. Durocher.

50:57.763 --> 50:59.513
Oh, just call me Ida.

50:59.598 --> 51:03.642
Ida. I was with Max when he got the call.

51:03.727 --> 51:05.853
And you came all the way
over here to see me?

51:05.937 --> 51:09.148
- It's nothing, ma'am.
- Tell my son.

51:09.232 --> 51:13.319
You have to hold a gun to his head
to make him do anything.

51:13.403 --> 51:16.781
You must be one of Max's
important clients.

51:16.865 --> 51:21.327
Client? I... You know, I like
to think of myself as his friend.

51:21.411 --> 51:23.162
Max never had many friends.

51:23.246 --> 51:26.123
Always talking to himself in the mirror.
It's unhealthy.

51:26.208 --> 51:28.667
Mom, how many times I got to ask you?
Please don't do that.

51:28.752 --> 51:29.835
Do what?

51:29.920 --> 51:33.005
Don't talk about me like
I'm not right here in the room here.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.381
What's he saying?

51:34.466 --> 51:38.052
He says he's standing right here,
in the room here.

51:38.136 --> 51:40.096
Yes, you are.

51:40.180 --> 51:43.057
- He's sensitive.
- I know.

51:43.141 --> 51:44.809
But I'm sure you're very proud of him.

51:44.893 --> 51:48.854
Of course I'm proud.
He started with nothing, you know.

51:48.939 --> 51:51.982
- Look at him today. Here, Vegas...
- Mom. Mom.

51:52.067 --> 51:55.277
Mom. Mom, he is not interested
in hearing about all that, okay?

51:55.362 --> 51:57.738
I came to see you, I saw you.
You look good, let's go.

51:57.823 --> 52:01.283
No, no, no. No, no, no.
I am very interested, Ida. Please.

52:01.368 --> 52:04.245
- Limousine companies.
- Is that right?

52:04.329 --> 52:06.664
He drives famous people around.

52:06.748 --> 52:11.085
Famous people. Limousine companies.
Now that's quite an achievement.

52:11.169 --> 52:13.170
What did you say your name was again?

52:13.255 --> 52:15.172
My name's Vincent, ma'am.

52:15.966 --> 52:19.510
- Visit again?
- No, I'm just in town tonight.

52:19.594 --> 52:21.971
- When you come back.
- Sure.

52:39.948 --> 52:41.115
Max!

53:25.035 --> 53:26.243
Don't!

53:55.565 --> 53:59.443
All of my prep was in there.
You are screwing with my work.

54:04.950 --> 54:06.992
Let's see what else you can do.

54:10.956 --> 54:14.875
Well, I've had four come in tonight.
Maybe one's your guy.

54:19.381 --> 54:21.966
No, not Ramone. Let's see this one.

54:27.889 --> 54:29.139
No, next.

54:29.224 --> 54:32.559
Okay, you know, something's funny
about this, though, you know?

54:32.644 --> 54:36.730
These three all came in within
half an hour of each other, right?

54:36.815 --> 54:41.277
The kid and that last guy,
both done by the same shooter, I think.

54:42.195 --> 54:44.947
- Why do you say that?
- Wound pattern.

54:46.157 --> 54:49.118
Two in the sternum, one in the head.

54:49.202 --> 54:52.579
This guy, he's shooting tight
groups too, all right? Check this out.

54:52.664 --> 54:55.791
Double taps a couple millimeters apart.

54:55.875 --> 54:57.668
Let's see this one.

55:06.970 --> 55:08.929
See what I mean?

55:10.682 --> 55:13.642
- Holy shit. Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

55:19.941 --> 55:22.067
Come on, come on, wake up.

55:37.042 --> 55:39.043
- Hello.
- Hey, it's Fanning.

55:39.127 --> 55:41.503
I'm still down here at the morgue
at Sisters of Charity.

55:41.588 --> 55:43.922
Those John Does didn't pan out,
but you're never gonna guess

55:44.007 --> 55:46.633
- who I got here in the meat locker.
- Who?

55:46.718 --> 55:50.846
Sylvester Clarke, criminal attorney
turned lawyer-criminal.

55:50.930 --> 55:55.726
Including Ramone, who he represented,
who's still missing.

55:55.810 --> 55:58.979
The both of whom are in the
exotic-substances business together.

55:59.064 --> 56:02.691
There's something going on,
and I don't think the feds know about it.

56:02.776 --> 56:06.070
Tell you what, stay on your cell phone.
I got the ASAC's phone.

56:06.154 --> 56:08.322
I'll hook up with you in 30 minutes.

56:08.406 --> 56:09.573
Good.

56:15.872 --> 56:17.706
You're gonna go to a place
called El Rodeo.

56:17.791 --> 56:19.792
It's on Washington Boulevard
in Pico Rivera.

56:19.876 --> 56:22.628
- Where at on Washington?
- Look it up.

56:27.634 --> 56:29.051
Limos, huh?

56:30.053 --> 56:31.595
Don't start.

56:31.679 --> 56:34.014
Hey, I'm not the one lying to my mother.

56:34.099 --> 56:36.975
She hears what she wants to hear.
I don't disillusion her.

56:37.060 --> 56:39.311
Yeah, right.
Maybe she hears what you tell her.

56:39.396 --> 56:41.271
Whatever I tell her
is never good enough anyway.

56:41.356 --> 56:43.482
It's always been that way.

56:44.484 --> 56:47.736
- So what's at El Rodeo?
- Just drive.

56:49.406 --> 56:51.615
They project onto you their flaws.

56:51.699 --> 56:55.285
What they don't like about themselves,
their lives, whatever.

56:55.370 --> 56:57.496
They rank on you instead.

56:59.165 --> 57:02.251
- How do you know?
- I had a father like that.

57:03.545 --> 57:04.837
Mothers are worse.

57:04.921 --> 57:07.589
Wouldn't know.
My mother died before I remember.

57:07.674 --> 57:10.008
What happened to your father?

57:10.468 --> 57:12.469
Hated everything I did.

57:13.596 --> 57:18.058
Got drunk, beat me up, foster homes.
Went back with him. Like that.

57:21.062 --> 57:22.438
Then what?

57:25.483 --> 57:27.025
I killed him.

57:28.736 --> 57:30.070
I was 12.

57:38.288 --> 57:39.788
I'm kidding.

57:42.750 --> 57:44.835
He died of liver disease.

57:47.380 --> 57:49.923
- Well, I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

58:05.482 --> 58:07.774
So what is this
"driving a cab temporarily"?

58:07.859 --> 58:11.695
- It's just all bullshit, huh?
- It is not bullshit.

58:11.779 --> 58:13.697
Twelve years isn't temporary, Max.

58:13.781 --> 58:17.493
Gotta get the cash together.
Insurance, bonds, maintenance, tires.

58:17.577 --> 58:19.369
Gotta staff up, get the right client list.

58:19.454 --> 58:22.539
It's not just simply get the car
and put asses in the seats.

58:22.624 --> 58:23.707
Why not?

58:23.791 --> 58:27.336
Because Island Limos
is more than just a ride.

58:27.420 --> 58:30.631
It's a... Like a club experience.
Cool groove.

58:31.674 --> 58:35.010
Don't want it to end.
It's gotta be perfect.

58:36.596 --> 58:37.930
Perfect.

58:39.557 --> 58:41.683
It's up here. Turn right.

59:01.871 --> 59:05.832
- Give me your wallet. Come on.
- Give you my wallet. For what?

59:05.917 --> 59:09.836
I'll hold it for you in case
the people inside search you.

59:09.921 --> 59:12.631
- Who's searching?
- The people inside.

59:12.715 --> 59:15.425
Go in, ask for Felix. He's expecting you.

59:15.510 --> 59:16.635
- Felix.
- Yeah.

59:16.719 --> 59:19.221
- What does he look like?
- I don't know, I've never met him.

59:19.305 --> 59:20.847
Who is he?

59:20.932 --> 59:23.433
He's connected to the guys
who hired me.

59:23.518 --> 59:25.769
- I don't get it.
- You destroyed my workups.

59:25.853 --> 59:27.396
Number four's due.
What'd you think, night's over?

59:27.480 --> 59:29.523
Called on account of rain?

59:29.607 --> 59:31.817
You go in there, say you're me.
Score the backups.

59:31.901 --> 59:34.069
They'll be on flash drive or CD.

59:34.153 --> 59:36.154
- Me? How come you don't go?
- I don't meet people.

59:36.239 --> 59:37.823
Risk management. Anonymity.
I protect mine.

59:37.907 --> 59:39.324
You're not gonna screw that up.

59:39.409 --> 59:42.452
I got a contract with their bosses.
These guys don't get to meet me.

59:42.537 --> 59:45.038
They don't know what I look like.

59:46.624 --> 59:49.251
If I don't pull it off, then...

59:49.335 --> 59:51.837
They will kill you.
Now, you got 10 minutes.

59:51.921 --> 59:53.589
At 10:01, I drive to the hospital

59:53.673 --> 59:55.591
and execute your mother
on my way out of town.

59:55.675 --> 59:59.428
- And don't pretend indifference.
- I can't do this. I can't.

59:59.512 --> 01:00:02.556
What are you talking about?
Sure you can, man. Come on. Hey. Hey.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.976
Look, man, if I do this, I'm just gonna
end up getting other people killed.

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:07.311
Out of options, Max.

01:00:07.395 --> 01:00:10.689
Just take comfort in knowing
you never had a choice.

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:14.192
- How long you been doing this?
- Why?

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:16.403
Just in case they ask me.

01:00:16.904 --> 01:00:20.657
- Private sector, six years.
- Okay. All right, six years.

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:25.203
You get benefits?
Or, you know, like, insurance? Pension?

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:29.082
No. No paid sick leave. Quit stalling.
Get out of the cab.

01:00:56.944 --> 01:00:59.237
- Yeah? Hold up.
- Hold on, man.

01:01:07.872 --> 01:01:09.373
Who is this?

01:01:13.544 --> 01:01:15.128
Mark the time.

01:01:20.259 --> 01:01:22.177
All right, it's cool.

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:29.518
- Qué pasa? What's up, homes?
- Hey. What's up?

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:33.730
I'm here to see Felix.
He has something for me.

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:35.649
Don't know no Felix.

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:41.822
Tell him...

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:46.576
Vince... Say it's Vincent.

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:49.079
I'm Vincent.

01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:04.136
Copy.

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:09.141
Let him in. Let him in right now.
Go ahead.

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:42.382
Detective Richard Weidner, LAPD,
Major Narcotics Division.

01:02:42.467 --> 01:02:44.176
Detective Ray Fanning, LAPD,
Major Narcotics...

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.678
Hi, yeah, okay, how are you?
Agent Frank Pedrosa.

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.180
Good. Thanks for seeing us, Frank.

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:49.931
Yeah, you're welcome. How can I help?

01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:51.933
What's up? Why do you wanna know
about our case?

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:54.519
- Any unusual activity tonight?
- Like what?

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.855
That relates to a murder
or a series of murders

01:02:56.939 --> 01:03:00.025
in Wilshire Central or West Hollywood?

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:02.194
All quiet on the western front.

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:04.988
Various people are asleep.
Various people are not.

01:03:05.072 --> 01:03:08.658
They come and go in cars,
pickups, taxis.

01:03:08.743 --> 01:03:11.369
Other than that, we watch air move.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:14.664
- Your interest in our case?
- Well, our interest...

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:16.792
We got a situation. Two bodies.

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:19.377
Could be a coincidence,
could not be a coincidence.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.796
It doesn't look like one.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:26.051
- We got an attorney and his client...
- Roof's all beat to shit.

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:28.220
Roof's all beat to shit.

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:31.389
Can you zoom in on this, please?

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:33.308
- On what?
- On that.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.691
- Look at that right there.
- What is it?

01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:49.533
Yeah. 5-Queen-49974.

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:51.910
5Q49974.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:50.385
I thought you'd be taller.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.181
So, Vincent.

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.563
- What are the two names?
- Ramone Ayala and Clarke.

01:05:01.647 --> 01:05:04.274
Are you telling me Ramone Ayala
and Clarke were murdered tonight?

01:05:04.358 --> 01:05:06.359
- Both killed?
- Sylvester Clarke for sure.

01:05:06.444 --> 01:05:08.486
- Ramone, I don't know.
- I got another DOA.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:11.156
Daniel Baker out of South Central,
Leimert Park.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.449
That's three.

01:05:12.533 --> 01:05:14.576
- Three what?
- Witnesses.

01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:21.541
Vincent meet their people
in Culiacán or Cartagena.

01:05:22.668 --> 01:05:25.045
But he don't meet you. Okay.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:28.632
Now you're here.

01:05:30.801 --> 01:05:31.968
Why?

01:05:35.556 --> 01:05:37.265
I lost my stuff.

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:40.101
The list.

01:05:42.688 --> 01:05:45.440
I want you to listen to me real well.

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:50.153
Special groups put together
the list of dedos.

01:05:50.237 --> 01:05:52.864
- Dedos?
- Fingers. Informants.

01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:59.371
Signal interceptions with
voice-recognition software, surveillance.

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:03.208
A very expensive counterintelligence
worked up that list.

01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:06.836
An important list. Wouldn't you say?

01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:10.632
And you lost it?

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:14.469
Yeah.

01:06:14.553 --> 01:06:15.971
I'm sorry.

01:06:17.431 --> 01:06:18.682
Sorry.

01:06:19.725 --> 01:06:21.017
Sorry?

01:06:21.102 --> 01:06:24.729
Sorry does not put
Humpty Dumpty back together again.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.276
- Do you believe in Humpty Dumpty?
- No.

01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:33.321
- Do you believe in Santa Claus?
- No.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:35.240
Nor do I.

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:38.284
Nor do I, but my children do.
They are still small.

01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:42.914
But do you know who they like even
better than Santa Claus? His helper.

01:06:43.916 --> 01:06:47.544
Pedro el Negro. Black Peter. Yeah.

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:52.674
There's an old Mexican tale
that tells of how Santa Claus

01:06:52.758 --> 01:06:55.385
got so very busy looking out
for the good children

01:06:55.469 --> 01:06:59.014
that he had to hire some help
to look out for the bad children.

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:01.182
So he hired Pedro.

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:03.226
And Santa Claus gave him a list

01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:06.771
with all the names
of all the bad children.

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:09.691
And Pedro would come every night
to check them out.

01:07:09.775 --> 01:07:12.777
And the people, the little kids
that were misbehaving,

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:15.363
that were not saying their prayers,

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:19.909
Pedro would leave a little toy donkey
on their windows,

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:21.911
a little burro.

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:23.872
And he would come back.

01:07:23.956 --> 01:07:25.874
And if the children
were still misbehaving,

01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:29.252
Pedro would take them away,
and nobody would ever see them again.

01:07:29.336 --> 01:07:34.674
Now, if I am being Santa Claus,
and you are Pedro,

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:38.470
how do you think jolly old
Santa Claus would feel

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:42.015
if one day Pedro came into his office
and said, "I lost the list"?

01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:45.310
How fucking furious
do you think he would get?

01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:48.063
Tell me, Vincent.

01:07:48.522 --> 01:07:50.565
Tell me what you think.

01:07:53.194 --> 01:07:54.402
What?

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:58.656
I think...

01:08:02.369 --> 01:08:05.121
I think you should tell the guy

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:08.500
behind me to put that gun down.

01:08:10.169 --> 01:08:12.378
What did you say?

01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:15.340
I said, I think you should tell the guy
behind me to put his gun away

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:19.176
before I take it
and beat his bitch ass to death with it.

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:31.356
I picked up a tail.

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:34.067
- Federal?
- I don't know, you tell me.

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:38.363
That's why I tossed the list.

01:08:38.738 --> 01:08:41.198
The workups, all of that shit.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:45.411
To protect, in part, your

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:48.747
Hermès, Façonnable ass.

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:56.923
What do you think,
I like coming in here?

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.426
But, hey, shit happens.

01:09:02.429 --> 01:09:04.596
Gotta roll with it. Adapt.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.433
Darwin. I Ching.

01:09:10.062 --> 01:09:11.979
- Has...
- The fat man, the penthouse guy,

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:13.606
the jazz man.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:16.943
That leaves two.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:27.620
Can you finish?

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.582
In six years,

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:35.295
when have I not?

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.881
Say it's Vincent.

01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:39.549
I'm Vincent.

01:09:39.633 --> 01:09:42.260
Say it's Vincent.

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:44.095
I'm Vincent.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.930
Say it's Vincent.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:49.058
I'm Vincent.

01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:50.852
- Say it's Vincent.
- Vincent?

01:09:50.935 --> 01:09:53.938
- That's what I'm hearing.
- I'm Vincent.

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.671
Your last two.

01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:26.095
And by the way,
as a token of my appreciation,

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.973
I would like to offer you a discount.

01:10:30.976 --> 01:10:34.103
For all my services, 25%.

01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:37.023
- Very generous.
- Hell, make it 35.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.735
And, by the way,

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:46.032
Daniel said he was sorry.

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:51.996
Interesting.

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:33.871
- E-mail me his license.
- All right?

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:35.915
- Right.
- To my cell phone.

01:11:36.041 --> 01:11:37.583
No, no, I'll wait.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:40.461
Hey, is there anybody else in that cab?

01:11:57.438 --> 01:12:00.064
Vegas odds would've been against you
walking out of there.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:02.275
Yeah, I'm very impressive.

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:09.449
Sixth Street by Alexandria,
a club called Fever. You know it?

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:22.295
Locate our witness, Peter Lim.
Get him evacuated, get him safe.

01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:24.630
- LA 101 to chase units.
- Yeah.

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:26.591
African-American, medium build.

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:28.968
The assault team, when they're
in place, will do the takedown.

01:12:29.094 --> 01:12:30.678
- Are you sure?
- Do not spook him before.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.680
I want air support up
and to maintain at 1500 feet.

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:33.931
Thank you.

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:42.106
- How long?
- Twelve minutes.

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:44.275
According to the
cab company's dispatch unit,

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.569
this guy's been driving that cab
for 12 years.

01:12:46.653 --> 01:12:48.404
- So what?
- So you're telling me

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:51.282
the guy walks into a phone booth
and, shazam,

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.493
changes into a meat-eater
super-assassin?

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:55.870
What's he do,
squeeze them in between fares?

01:12:55.954 --> 01:12:58.373
No, the real cab driver
is floating down a storm drain.

01:12:58.457 --> 01:13:00.541
The guy who walked out of there
looks like this guy.

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:02.710
'Cause he picked a cab driver
who looks like him.

01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:06.130
- Yeah, I don't know.
- I do. Zee?

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:09.467
We see private-sector security
companies hiring out to cartels

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.719
in Colombia, Russia, Mexico,

01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:16.516
hiring ex-Special Forces, Stasi,
ex-KGB, like that, all the time.

01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:20.812
Guys with trigger time, skill sets, real
tradecraft, like, look like a cab driver.

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:22.897
What are you gonna do?

01:13:22.981 --> 01:13:25.650
Take his ass down. Save our witness.

01:13:31.323 --> 01:13:32.657
What if these guys are wrong?

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:35.118
They got the guy admitting
his name is Vincent.

01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:38.121
- He's in there talking to the bad guys.
- There is something else going on.

01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:41.666
Ray, there's nothing else going on.
I thought there was, there isn't.

01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:44.460
It's their ball, it's their game.
There's nothing in it for us.

01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:46.462
- There's nothing in it for you.
- That's right.

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:50.049
It's late. I'm going home.
You know what time it is?

01:14:41.393 --> 01:14:43.519
They locate Peter Lim yet?

01:14:49.067 --> 01:14:51.319
Sheila's on with the wife.
She thinks he's at Fever.

01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:53.070
Sixth and Alexandria. Move it.

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:57.158
LA 101 to LA 103, LA 105, LA 108.

01:14:57.242 --> 01:14:59.869
Witness is in a club called Fever,
Sixth and Alexandria.

01:14:59.953 --> 01:15:01.370
That's where Vincent is going.

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:03.789
Assault team and remaining unit,
you will take Vincent.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:07.168
First unit on the scene will get
the witness, Peter Lim. Get him out.

01:15:07.252 --> 01:15:10.546
LA 105 to LA 101. Copy that.

01:15:45.582 --> 01:15:47.875
- You gonna call her?
- Who?

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:51.546
You know, your lady friend, the one
who gave you her business card.

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:55.800
- I don't know. Maybe, maybe not.
- What?

01:15:56.969 --> 01:15:58.761
Pick up the phone.

01:15:59.763 --> 01:16:02.515
Life's short. One day, it's gone.

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:11.691
You and I make it out of this alive,
you should call her.

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:13.651
That's what I think.

01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:17.154
Anyway...

01:18:00.258 --> 01:18:02.093
There he is. Hit it.

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:35.167
Let's do it.

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:46.971
Table towards the back
is where he hangs.

01:18:59.317 --> 01:19:02.319
Wilke, take the right.
Brian, hold the door.

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:05.489
Clean shots. Watch your backgrounds.
Watch your backgrounds.

01:19:05.615 --> 01:19:06.949
LAPD.

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:04.131
You move 15 feet ahead,
3 feet to the left.

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:07.968
Wander, innocent bystanders
get the first rounds. Clear?

01:21:49.487 --> 01:21:53.490
There's Lim. Second booth from the left.
Get him out of here.

01:22:02.834 --> 01:22:05.502
Middle of the dance floor.
Freeze, Vincent!

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:09.757
FBI! FBI! Get your hands in the air!
Get your hands in the air, Vincent!

01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:13.177
- Freeze! Get your hands up!
- FBI. Where's Peter Lim?

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:15.638
FBI! Get your hands in the air!

01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:17.848
Drop it!

01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:21.018
- Freeze!
- Freeze! FBI!

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:23.520
- I'm not Vincent.
- FBI!

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:27.107
Yo, put the gun down!
You got the wrong...

01:22:57.555 --> 01:23:00.224
Pedrosa's been shot. Get an RA unit.

01:23:18.994 --> 01:23:21.036
No, no, no! Wait, wait!

01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:54.445
Hey, hey! Hold on. Hold on.
I'm Detective Fanning.

01:23:54.529 --> 01:23:55.612
I'm Max! I'm Max!

01:23:55.739 --> 01:23:57.948
I'm a goddamn cab driver, man!
I'm a goddamn cab driver.

01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:02.077
I know. I know. I'm getting you
out of here. I'm LAPD. Come on.

01:24:39.282 --> 01:24:41.075
- How'd you find me?
- You're okay. You're okay.

01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:43.327
Just move it. Keep moving.

01:24:52.295 --> 01:24:53.754
You're okay.

01:24:54.672 --> 01:24:57.758
- How'd you find me?
- You're okay. You're okay.

01:24:57.842 --> 01:25:00.260
You're okay. You're all right.

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:10.646
Let's go!

01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:14.525
Let's go.

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:24.993
Go! Drive! Drive!

01:26:02.866 --> 01:26:06.118
Only thing didn't show up
is the Polish cavalry.

01:26:07.078 --> 01:26:09.663
You're alive. I saved you.

01:26:12.917 --> 01:26:16.712
Do I get any thanks? No.
All you can do is clam up.

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:22.593
You wanna talk?
Do you want me to fuck off?

01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:24.094
Fuck off.

01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:29.892
- You had to kill Fanning?
- Who the fuck is Fanning?

01:26:29.976 --> 01:26:31.727
Fanning, the cop.

01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:35.314
Why'd you have to kill him?

01:26:35.398 --> 01:26:38.650
He's probably got a family.
Kids are gonna grow up without him.

01:26:38.735 --> 01:26:40.652
He believed me.

01:26:40.737 --> 01:26:42.905
Oh, I should've saved him
because he believed you.

01:26:42.989 --> 01:26:44.740
- No, no. Not that.
- Yeah. That.

01:26:44.824 --> 01:26:46.366
Well, yeah, that.
What's wrong with that?

01:26:46.451 --> 01:26:48.911
- It's what I do for a living.
- Some living.

01:26:48.995 --> 01:26:51.205
- Head downtown.
- What's downtown?

01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:55.292
How are you at math?
I was hired for five hits. I did four.

01:26:57.337 --> 01:27:01.048
Why didn't you just kill me
and get another cab driver?

01:27:01.132 --> 01:27:03.592
Because you're good.
We're in this together.

01:27:03.676 --> 01:27:05.677
Fates intertwined.
Cosmic coincidence, you know.

01:27:05.762 --> 01:27:08.597
- Come on. You full of shit.
- All that crap. I'm full of shit?

01:27:08.681 --> 01:27:10.766
You're a monument of it.
You even bullshitted yourself.

01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:13.310
"All I am is taking out the garbage,
killing bad people."

01:27:13.394 --> 01:27:16.521
- Well, that's what you said.
- You believed me?

01:27:17.607 --> 01:27:20.651
- Then what'd they do?
- How do I know, you know?

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:25.948
They all got that "witness for
the prosecution" look to me.

01:27:26.032 --> 01:27:28.116
Probably some major
federal indictment of somebody

01:27:28.201 --> 01:27:31.203
who majorly does not
wanna get indicted.

01:27:31.287 --> 01:27:33.413
So that's the reason?

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:35.666
That's the why. There's no reason.

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:39.544
There's no good reason,
there's no bad reason to live or to die.

01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:41.630
Then what are you?

01:27:41.714 --> 01:27:43.257
Indifferent.

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:47.511
Get with it.

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:49.846
Millions of galaxies
of hundreds of millions of stars

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:52.516
and a speck on one in a blink.

01:27:53.059 --> 01:27:55.227
That's us. Lost in space.

01:27:55.311 --> 01:27:59.147
The cop, you, me, who notices?

01:28:08.408 --> 01:28:10.367
What's with you?

01:28:11.828 --> 01:28:13.495
As in?

01:28:13.579 --> 01:28:16.081
As in, if somebody had a gun
to your head and said,

01:28:16.165 --> 01:28:18.750
"You gotta tell me what's going on
with this person over here

01:28:18.835 --> 01:28:20.877
"or I'm gonna kill you.

01:28:22.588 --> 01:28:25.716
"What is driving him?
What was he thinking?"

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.009
You know, you couldn't do it, could you?

01:28:27.093 --> 01:28:29.970
Because they would
have to kill your ass,

01:28:30.054 --> 01:28:33.932
because you don't know
what anyone else is thinking.

01:28:35.685 --> 01:28:38.937
I think you're low, my brother. Way low.

01:28:40.106 --> 01:28:43.942
Like, what were you? One of those
institutionalized-raised guys?

01:28:44.027 --> 01:28:45.944
Anybody home?

01:28:46.029 --> 01:28:49.865
And... And the standard parts that
are supposed to be there in people,

01:28:49.949 --> 01:28:52.701
in you, aren't.

01:28:57.874 --> 01:29:00.500
And why haven't you killed me yet?

01:29:03.671 --> 01:29:08.008
Of all the cabbies in L.A., I get Max,
Sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth.

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:10.969
Answer the question.

01:29:13.222 --> 01:29:15.057
Look in the mirror.

01:29:16.059 --> 01:29:18.727
Paper towels, clean cab,
limo company someday.

01:29:18.811 --> 01:29:21.897
- How much you got saved?
- That ain't none of your business.

01:29:21.981 --> 01:29:25.400
Someday?
"Someday my dream will come"?

01:29:25.485 --> 01:29:28.737
One night you'll wake up,
and you'll discover it never happened.

01:29:28.821 --> 01:29:33.158
It's all turned around on you.
It never will. Suddenly you are old.

01:29:34.994 --> 01:29:36.078
Didn't happen.

01:29:36.162 --> 01:29:39.206
And it never will, because you
were never gonna do it anyway.

01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:42.417
You'll push it into memory,
then zone out in your Barcalounger,

01:29:42.502 --> 01:29:46.922
being hypnotized by daytime TV
for the rest of your life.

01:29:47.006 --> 01:29:49.007
Don't you talk to me about murder.

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:53.136
All it ever took was a down payment
on a Lincoln Town Car.

01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:56.306
Or that girl. You can't even call that girl.

01:29:57.058 --> 01:30:00.352
What the fuck are you still doing
driving a cab?

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:21.665
Because I never straightened up
and looked at it, you know?

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:24.751
Myself. I should have.

01:30:26.587 --> 01:30:28.171
I've tried to gamble my way
out from under

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:31.383
but that was just a born-to-lose deal.

01:30:31.467 --> 01:30:33.510
- Slow down.
- It's gotta be perfect.

01:30:33.594 --> 01:30:37.264
It's got to be perfect to go.
Risk all torqued down.

01:30:39.183 --> 01:30:42.060
I could've done it anytime I wanted to.

01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:43.562
Red light.

01:30:50.653 --> 01:30:52.863
But you know what? New news.

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:56.074
It doesn't matter anyway.
What does it matter anyway?

01:30:56.159 --> 01:30:59.870
We're all insignificant out here
in this big-ass nowhere.

01:30:59.954 --> 01:31:01.913
Twilight Zone shit.

01:31:07.253 --> 01:31:10.213
Says the badass sociopath
in my back seat.

01:31:14.427 --> 01:31:17.804
But you know what? That's the one thing
I gotta thank you for, bro.

01:31:17.889 --> 01:31:21.224
Because until now,
I never looked at it that way.

01:31:23.769 --> 01:31:27.189
What does it matter?
It don't, so fuck it. Fix it.

01:31:27.732 --> 01:31:30.358
What do we got to lose anyway, right?

01:31:30.443 --> 01:31:32.861
- Slow down.
- Why? You gonna shoot me?

01:31:32.945 --> 01:31:34.446
You gonna pull the trigger and kill us?

01:31:34.530 --> 01:31:36.406
- Go ahead, shoot my ass.
- Slow the hell down.

01:31:36.491 --> 01:31:39.409
You gonna shoot me? You gonna
shoot me now? You gonna kill us?

01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:42.245
Well, shoot my ass, then.
Huh? Shoot me.

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:44.456
- Slow down!
- You're right.

01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:47.792
You know what, Vincent?

01:31:48.377 --> 01:31:50.212
Go fuck yourself!

01:32:22.662 --> 01:32:26.498
- Well, that was brilliant.
- Didn't have your seat belt on?

01:33:04.537 --> 01:33:07.372
1-L-20, show me code 6
at Olympic and Figueroa

01:33:07.456 --> 01:33:09.082
on a TC with injuries.

01:33:09.166 --> 01:33:12.836
- Copy your location.
- Sir, are you okay? What happened?

01:33:14.213 --> 01:33:16.506
Sir, you were involved in an accident.

01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:18.925
An ambulance is on its way to help you.

01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:23.179
You understand what I'm saying to you?
Sit down and relax, okay?

01:33:24.849 --> 01:33:28.685
Okay. Don't worry about the cab.
They'll get you a new one.

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:32.230
Relax and breathe.

01:33:46.662 --> 01:33:48.038
Put your hands up.

01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:51.416
Put your hands up. Face the cab.
Get down on your knees.

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.960
- Go ahead and arrest me.
- Put your hands on top of your head.

01:33:54.045 --> 01:33:55.712
Take me to jail. L.A. County jail's great.

01:33:55.796 --> 01:33:58.882
Don't move!
Put your hands behind your head.

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:06.973
1-L-20, I need a backup
on a 187 suspect.

01:34:20.112 --> 01:34:22.489
- Put your gun down!
- Get back! Put your hands down!

01:34:22.573 --> 01:34:24.366
- Look, I gotta go.
- Put down the gun!

01:34:24.450 --> 01:34:26.701
Stop moving! Stop moving!

01:34:26.786 --> 01:34:29.120
When did this become a negotiation?

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:33.667
Clap your hands together.
Hold your hands together.

01:34:33.751 --> 01:34:37.128
Listen, somebody's gonna get killed
if I don't go right now.

01:34:37.213 --> 01:34:39.673
Now, cuff yourself.

01:34:39.757 --> 01:34:42.717
I'm going to Sixth and Fig.
Call the cops.

01:34:59.485 --> 01:35:03.530
- Give me that.
- Hey, hey! Whoa! Fuck!

01:35:30.891 --> 01:35:32.225
Come on!

01:36:01.756 --> 01:36:04.299
Come on. Go through.

01:36:05.676 --> 01:36:08.595
Come on. Come on. Pick up.

01:36:27.114 --> 01:36:28.448
Pick up.

01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:31.701
Come on, girl.

01:36:32.995 --> 01:36:34.120
Come on, pick up.

01:36:58.187 --> 01:36:59.437
U.S. Attorney's Office.

01:36:59.522 --> 01:37:00.772
- Annie!
- Yes.

01:37:00.856 --> 01:37:04.734
It's Max. Max, the cab driver.
Listen to me, all right?

01:37:04.819 --> 01:37:06.528
- A guy named Vincent...
- Max.

01:37:06.612 --> 01:37:08.696
Listen to me, Annie.

01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:12.826
- It's kind of a strange time to be calling.
- Listen. Listen, Annie.

01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:16.454
There's a man named Vincent.
He's coming to kill you.

01:37:17.289 --> 01:37:20.291
- He's what?
- Kill you! He's coming to kill you!

01:37:20.376 --> 01:37:22.919
He was scoping out the building
when I dropped you off...

01:37:23.003 --> 01:37:25.380
Okay, you know what?
Max, if this is supposed to be

01:37:25.464 --> 01:37:27.423
some type of joke, it's not funny.

01:37:27.508 --> 01:37:29.676
It's not a joke. Listen to me.
Annie, listen to me, please.

01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:33.930
Felix hired him. Okay?
Or people that Felix worked for.

01:37:34.014 --> 01:37:36.641
Felix Reyes-Torrena.
How do you know about my case?

01:37:36.725 --> 01:37:38.434
I don't understand what's going on.

01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:40.645
All I know is that
he's already killed witnesses.

01:37:40.771 --> 01:37:42.856
He's coming to kill you.

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:44.941
When I dropped you off,
I don't know how it happened,

01:37:45.025 --> 01:37:47.277
but he ended up in my cab.

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:07.964
Annie.

01:38:08.465 --> 01:38:11.217
Annie, listen. All I want you to do...

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:21.603
- I don't understand what's going on.
- Annie, listen. Listen.

01:38:21.687 --> 01:38:23.646
- Max.
- Please listen.

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:48.087
Get out of the building. Annie.

01:38:52.051 --> 01:38:53.635
Okay, I'm leaving the building right now.

01:38:53.719 --> 01:38:55.470
No, no, no, wait.

01:38:55.554 --> 01:38:57.430
- Max.
- Wait, wait.

01:38:59.516 --> 01:39:01.309
- Max.
- Listen, where are you right now?

01:39:01.393 --> 01:39:03.144
- What floor?
- I'm on the sixteenth floor.

01:39:03.228 --> 01:39:05.480
I'm in the law library and files.

01:39:05.564 --> 01:39:07.941
He's two floors below you, corner office.

01:39:08.025 --> 01:39:09.400
In my office?

01:39:09.526 --> 01:39:10.944
Listen, he does not know
you're up there.

01:39:11.028 --> 01:39:12.528
Just stay right there and call 911.

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:14.364
Max, are you sure
he's on the fourteenth floor?

01:39:14.448 --> 01:39:18.534
Listen, just stay there and just call
the police. Just call the police.

01:39:18.619 --> 01:39:19.786
Max?

01:39:23.582 --> 01:39:24.749
Shit.

01:39:31.548 --> 01:39:32.799
Max?

01:39:39.264 --> 01:39:40.473
Shit.

01:39:46.605 --> 01:39:50.024
- Max.
- Annie, he knows you're up there. Just...

01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:51.484
I can't hear you. Hello?

01:39:51.568 --> 01:39:53.736
Annie. Annie, listen to me.

01:39:54.905 --> 01:39:56.155
Shit.

01:39:58.617 --> 01:40:00.159
Annie. Annie!

01:40:02.413 --> 01:40:03.579
Shit.

01:41:00.012 --> 01:41:01.471
911. Operator.

01:41:01.555 --> 01:41:04.307
Yes. Listen, there is a man
in my building, and he is...

01:41:08.979 --> 01:41:10.188
Hello?

01:44:19.336 --> 01:44:21.295
Let her go.

01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:22.880
Max?

01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:27.969
Why? What are you gonna do about it?

01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.015
Come on.

01:44:46.029 --> 01:44:47.196
Max!

01:45:07.050 --> 01:45:11.178
- Oh, God. Felix Reyes-Torrena?
- Yeah. I met him.

01:45:11.263 --> 01:45:13.180
What do you mean, you met him? How?

01:45:13.265 --> 01:45:16.767
I don't know. Look, when I
dropped you off, there was a fare.

01:45:16.893 --> 01:45:19.687
- He said his name is Vincent.
- Vincent?

01:45:25.861 --> 01:45:28.946
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- This is the street.

01:45:30.073 --> 01:45:31.866
This way. Come on.

01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:02.605
Stay up. Stay up. Stay up.

01:46:02.731 --> 01:46:05.816
- What we gonna do?
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

01:46:05.942 --> 01:46:07.651
No, no. This way.

01:46:30.634 --> 01:46:32.635
Wait, wait. Wait. Wait.

01:46:56.326 --> 01:46:57.660
Stay down.

01:47:45.876 --> 01:47:47.042
Shit.

01:47:55.051 --> 01:47:56.760
There's a station.

01:48:37.636 --> 01:48:38.886
Shit.

01:49:13.964 --> 01:49:15.256
Max!

01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:19.343
I do this for a living!

01:50:30.373 --> 01:50:34.043
We're almost at the next stop.

01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:38.213
Hey, Max.

01:50:42.177 --> 01:50:45.888
A guy gets on the MTA here in L.A.
and dies.

01:50:51.061 --> 01:50:53.228
Think anybody will notice?
