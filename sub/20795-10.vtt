Now, Bill,
last time I saw you

12:22.709 --> 12:25.375
I was in a fetal position
while you kicked me.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.208
Yeah, and I was
punching you

12:26.208 --> 12:28.166

of yours.

12:32.792 --> 12:34.542
No, not lately.

12:34.542 --> 12:36.542
All my exercise has come
from being a pallbearer, Kenny.

12:36.542 --> 12:39.750
Sadly, my father passed away
recently--heart attack.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.083
I'm--I'm sorry to hear that,
Bill.

12:42.083 --> 12:43.875
Ah, thanks,
I appreciate that,

12:43.875 --> 12:46.750
but I got to tell you, being
a pallbearer is a great workout.

12:46.750 --> 12:48.750
You know, people thought
that I was crying,

12:48.750 --> 12:50.625
but I was actually sweating
profusely.

12:50.625 --> 12:51.959
And just so people know
the difference,

12:51.959 --> 12:54.542
you don't usually grunt
when you cry.

12:54.542 --> 12:57.041
I didn't really get cremation,
Kenny, until I had to haul

12:57.041 --> 12:59.542
my father's body
up a hill to his plot.

12:59.542 --> 13:01.750
I did lose my dad, but, uh,
I also lost five pounds.

13:01.750 --> 13:04.041
Ho ho.
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:04.041 --> 13:04.583
But you know what?
Great note for me.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.959
My dad's a solid 365.

13:06.959 --> 13:08.750
I'm gonna keep that
in mind.

even Christmas.

17:44.667 --> 17:46.625
How the fuck are you mad
at Christmas?

17:48.709 --> 17:51.041
Oh, so what you're telling me
is Baby Jesus got frankincense,

myrrh, and gold for His birthday
when He was born?

17:53.542 --> 17:57.583

17:58.667 --> 18:02.041
[Adam] Didn't even give me
a birth certificate.

18:02.041 --> 18:05.250
All I got was titty milk
and a name tag.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.083
[laughter]

18:07.083 --> 18:08.959
And my name was
spelled wrong.

18:09.917 --> 18:12.792
Who the fuck is Darnell?

18:12.792 --> 18:14.417
But it wasn't
just Christmas.

18:14.417 --> 18:16.083
It wasn't just Christmas
and Santa Claus, all right?

18:16.083 --> 18:18.291
It was also the Tooth Fairy.

18:18.291 --> 18:20.625
Now, all of my friends would get
coins from the Tooth Fairy

18:20.625 --> 18:22.458
when they put a tooth
under they pillow.

18:22.458 --> 18:25.750
I put a tooth under my pillow,
I ain't get shit.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.625
Seriously, and I would try
to complain...

18:28.625 --> 18:30.458
complain to Parnell--
"Hey, the Tooth Fairy

18:30.458 --> 18:32.250
didn't leave me shit
under my pillow."

18:32.250 --> 18:35.125
His response was, "Look,
the Tooth Fairy gave you

18:35.125 --> 18:38.458
a roof over you head
and three square meals."

18:38.458 --> 18:38.959
[unamplified] If you don't want
to lose another one,

18:38.959 --> 18:39.875

18:43.125 --> 18:44.500
And that's just how it goes.
