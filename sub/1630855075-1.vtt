WEBVTT

00:09.175 --> 00:10.427
<i>Thank you, Susie.</i>

00:11.136 --> 00:13.430
Uh, I think I see someone new here today.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.015
Would you like to share your story?

00:18.643 --> 00:20.895
Sure. Well, I'm Mike.

00:21.521 --> 00:22.355
Gambler.

00:25.316 --> 00:26.359
Lost my job.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.611
Lost my friends. Lost my wife.

00:31.906 --> 00:32.824
That's it.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.829
I'd say you gave away the ending,

00:37.829 --> 00:39.998
but most of us have seen the movie.

00:41.541 --> 00:44.586
Um, maybe, tell us how it started.

00:48.673 --> 00:49.591
With gold.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.011
In a fish.

00:58.016 --> 00:58.850
And a lie.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.688
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

01:03.688 --> 01:06.399
I'm sorry. I'm looking for a hammer.
You know anything about hammers?

01:07.400 --> 01:09.611
Depends on what you need it for.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.196
This is a framing hammer.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.530
- Mm-hm.
- Mostly for carpentry.

01:13.156 --> 01:17.911
That's a ball-peen for metal work,
an all-purpose claw, a mallet.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.289
Which one would be good
for breaking a guy's leg?

01:27.837 --> 01:30.507
I know you... from the gamblers meeting.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.426
Ex-gamblers meeting, Gil.

01:34.552 --> 01:36.012
Someone's not doing their steps.

01:37.597 --> 01:38.431
Don't.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.269
Tell Moss he'll get his money.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.313
I got a fortune coming in.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.232
Two weeks, tops.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.651
We're standing in front
of a rack full of hammers.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.569
Does that suggest I'm here to negotiate?

01:53.404 --> 01:57.033
You're a piece of work.
How can you do this to other gamblers?

01:57.033 --> 01:58.660
I'm not a carpenter.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.828
I'm just a tool.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.205
I took an inventory of all my shortcomings

02:02.205 --> 02:04.374
and I'm making amends
to people I've wronged.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.209
In this case, Moss Yankov.

02:07.418 --> 02:11.089
So... maybe this one?

02:15.426 --> 02:17.679
<i>♪ I've been having such a bad time... ♪</i>

02:18.888 --> 02:19.806
Two weeks!

02:19.806 --> 02:21.516
Just give me two weeks!

02:30.233 --> 02:32.777
Fuck!

02:33.444 --> 02:35.780
Fuck.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.325
You fucking asshole.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.869
You're not angry at me.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.371
- You're angry with yourself.

02:50.253 --> 02:53.715
<i>♪ Walking on the beaches

02:57.135 --> 02:59.512
What is that?
It's not what you think.

03:00.763 --> 03:04.142
- How the fuck is this not what I think?
- I'm not giving it to you.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.895
I'm giving it back. It's yours.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.606
- The pawn shop still had it?
- No.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.483
I showed the guy a picture of it on you
and had him make one.

03:12.483 --> 03:15.403
Make one? And you're just giving it back?

03:15.403 --> 03:16.863
Restitution.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.448
It's part of the program.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.116
Okay.

03:21.659 --> 03:22.660
Thank you.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.792
- I want us to start over.
- See? I knew this was what I think.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.128
- It's been a year--
- Mike, come on.

03:32.128 --> 03:35.214
I'm not gambling anymore.
I'm going to meetings. Look, I got a pin.

03:35.214 --> 03:37.592
- And you lost a badge.
- I'm paying off all my debt.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.636
By working for the gangster you owe it to?

03:43.806 --> 03:45.808
It's fine. Whatever.

03:51.147 --> 03:55.777
Hey, speaking of gangsters,
I'm on this task force, right?

03:55.777 --> 03:57.779
And Moss Yankov, he--

03:59.572 --> 04:00.531
What?

04:02.575 --> 04:06.287
No. What are--? You always think
you know what I'm gonna say.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.915
- You want my help with Moss.
- Okay, yeah.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.542
- Because you're on the inside.
- On the inside of nothing.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.796
- He's not worth your time.
- I just made detective,

04:14.796 --> 04:17.924
which I put on hold for all our stuff.
Your stuff.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.843
- Are you saying I owe you?
- You saying you don't?

04:21.427 --> 04:24.722
Get on the right side of this.
You're better than breaking legs for Moss.

04:24.722 --> 04:27.767
No, wait.
First of all, I've never broken a leg.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.478
Technically.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.940
Then call it restitution.

04:38.611 --> 04:39.487
Okay.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.534
If I say I'll think about it,
will you take the ring?

04:47.161 --> 04:50.540
Would you really want me back
under that kind of coercion?

04:51.708 --> 04:52.542
Yeah.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.299
I'll pay you back
in something better than money.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.676
- Gold.
- Buried treasure.

05:03.344 --> 05:04.971
You fucking kidding me?

05:04.971 --> 05:05.930
Sunken.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.474
- But yeah.
- Sunken? Right.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.686
In 1715, a Spanish fleet went down

05:11.686 --> 05:13.813
and this one ship
sank off central Florida--

05:13.813 --> 05:15.982
Hey, Gil, open up.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.027
- What?
- Like this. Go:

05:19.485 --> 05:22.405
- Aw...
- Aw...

05:25.033 --> 05:28.911
Now, you can spit it out or shit it out.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.371
The next time I see that coin

05:30.371 --> 05:33.041
it better be worth
the 200 grand you owe me.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.461

06:04.781 --> 06:06.908
You said you wouldn't work late
on my birthday.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.242
Yeah. Almost done.

06:08.242 --> 06:09.202

Thank you.

06:44.028 --> 06:47.281
Next up is anniversary, huh?

06:47.281 --> 06:48.658
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

06:48.658 --> 06:49.992
Anniversary of what?

06:49.992 --> 06:51.994
Us. A year.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.830
We should decide what to do.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.581
Maybe we get out of Philly.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.083
Maybe Atlantic City?

06:57.583 --> 06:58.626
Mm.

06:59.585 --> 07:00.920
This cake is good.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.130
It's been how long?

07:02.630 --> 07:05.299
I know, right? It went by fast.

07:05.299 --> 07:06.634
My dad's funeral.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.261
Me taking over.

07:08.761 --> 07:13.558
It's like a blur, but you,
you know, you were a rock.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.017
You got me through.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.103
Yeah. You too.

07:19.564 --> 07:20.565
Anyway...

07:21.732 --> 07:23.443
Happy birthday.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.527
Moss.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.778
Just open it.

07:38.207 --> 07:39.292
Oh, my God.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.502
Nice, huh? Those are real.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.214
Is this a hair?

07:47.383 --> 07:48.426
What? Where?

07:49.010 --> 07:50.803
There's some girl's hair in the clasp.

07:50.803 --> 07:54.515
- The fucking jewelry store.
- Unbelievable!

07:54.515 --> 07:56.225
Delly, sit down. Come on.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.186
It's your birthday.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.021
Tell your fence thank you.

08:00.021 --> 08:03.024
It's pre-owned, so what?
You ever hear of estate jewelry?

08:03.024 --> 08:05.902
One time, Moss. One time, just one time,

08:05.902 --> 08:09.155
I would love to get something not stolen,
you know?

08:09.155 --> 08:10.490
Special.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.576
That you got just for me,
that no one else has had.

08:14.702 --> 08:15.870
Delly!

08:24.086 --> 08:25.838
Make sure she gets home okay.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.973
You know, you never see
this the other way.

08:35.973 --> 08:40.353
A man storming down the street,
a woman in a car begging him to get in.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.771
I just don't know why.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.690
Because once she got him out,
she'd hit the gas and never look back.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.317
Can you get in, please?

08:47.276 --> 08:48.653
This block isn't great.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.112
A lot of prostitutes.

08:50.112 --> 08:52.156
Yeah, well, what's one more then?

08:53.032 --> 08:54.200
Just do me a favor.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.826
I don't recall owing you a favor.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.578
How about I'll owe you one?

09:45.167 --> 09:47.003
We said this wasn't gonna happen again.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.299
Probably was, though.

10:09.025 --> 10:09.859
I need coffee.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.445
I have to get you home.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.491
He talks about you, you know. Mm-hm.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.493
His own cop.

10:20.244 --> 10:23.956
Like a golden retriever
who just fetches a stick when he's told.

10:42.975 --> 10:46.520
Medium extreme ultimate vanilla
ice blended with two shots of caramel.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.294
Here you go.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.464
- Now I get you home.
- Wait.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.510
Maybe we find a highway.

11:19.136 --> 11:19.970
What?

11:19.970 --> 11:22.640
You know?
Just keep going, change our luck.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.521
- I have obligations.
- To Moss? No.

11:28.521 --> 11:33.109
You understand you're never, ever
getting out from under Moss, right?

11:39.824 --> 11:41.075
Where will this highway go?

11:42.410 --> 11:43.411
I don't know.

11:44.578 --> 11:45.413
Florida.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.372
No.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.834
Why not? It seems like a place
that could provide a lot of opportunity.

11:49.834 --> 11:50.751
Oh, it is.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.837
It provided me
with the opportunity to leave.

11:53.504 --> 11:54.797
You're kidding me.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.676
- You're from there?
- Yes, and I'm not going back.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.239
Yeah.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.200
It's about Delly.

12:24.910 --> 12:25.828
What about her?

12:25.828 --> 12:28.080
You drove her home
after her birthday dinner.

12:29.373 --> 12:30.332
I did. Yeah.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.334
What did you talk about?

12:33.419 --> 12:34.879
Nothing. We didn't talk.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.714
She didn't say anything at all?

12:36.714 --> 12:37.882
Let me think.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.886
No. Why?

12:44.054 --> 12:44.889
She's gone.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.809
- What do you mean?
I mean gone.

12:49.977 --> 12:51.604
<i>I gave her a new BMW.</i>

12:51.604 --> 12:52.730
<i>We made up.</i>

12:52.730 --> 12:53.939
Everything was great.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.108
<i>Then she took it and left.</i>

12:57.651 --> 12:58.527
Where did she go?

12:58.527 --> 13:00.613
Some place named Coronado Beach, Florida.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.780
She got a ticket.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.115
Red light camera.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.534
Emailed to me
because the car's in my name.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.745
Another one an hour later
going the other way.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.705
You know what that does to the insurance.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.542
- What is she doing in Florida?
- How the fuck would I know?

13:13.542 --> 13:17.004
- I just need you to go and get her.
- What? Fuck no.

13:17.004 --> 13:17.963
Can't do it.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.758
- Yes.
- No.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.219
- Ye--
- No.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.723
Look, she can't just leave me, Mike.

13:27.723 --> 13:28.933
How does that look?

13:28.933 --> 13:30.893
My father wouldn't have let it go, right?

13:34.563 --> 13:35.648
Fifty grand.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.982
- What?
- Of what I owe.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.068
Fuck you!
I can make you do it for nothing.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.363
You can make me look for nothing.
Finding her is gonna cost 50.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.866
Fucking gamblers.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.410
Okay.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.121
Fifty off what you owe,

13:51.121 --> 13:54.291
or a hundred added on if you fail.

13:57.628 --> 13:58.712
Okay.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.381
Good. Start driving.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.924
Oh, I'm not driving.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.426
I'm taking a flight.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.179
At the last minute?
You know what that's gonna cost me?

14:07.179 --> 14:09.890
- Are you fucking kidding me right now?
- Fine.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.686
<i>But an economy rental car.</i>

14:13.686 --> 14:14.687
<i>And...</i>

14:15.688 --> 14:17.106
she might need persuading.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.860
<i>So, you can't take a weapon on a plane
without paperwork,</i>

14:21.860 --> 14:23.070
<i>how you gonna get a gun?</i>

14:23.070 --> 14:26.073
Moss, it's Florida.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.706
When are we going to Disney World?

14:33.706 --> 14:34.665
Yeah.

14:34.665 --> 14:38.711
I told you, we'll go to Disney World
after Daddy gets his gun.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.646
<i>Welcome to the Palm's, my friend.</i>

14:57.646 --> 15:01.066
I am Benny. I am the owner.
Anything you want, you tell me.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.068
You could lose the apostrophe.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.905
- The what?
-"Palm's."

15:06.989 --> 15:07.990
It's possessive.

15:08.657 --> 15:09.909
Yes.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.201
It is my possession.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.290
How about a sewing kit?

15:33.682 --> 15:35.017
Motherfucker.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.670
Miguelón, take your sister,

16:02.670 --> 16:04.254

16:53.887 --> 16:56.348

16:56.348 --> 16:57.725

17:29.506 --> 17:32.301
There he is. Hi, sleepyhead.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.680
- Patsy?
- You never said you were coming home.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.099
It was a work thing.
Sorry. I was gonna call you.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.685
- How did you know I was in the hospital?
- From the news.

17:41.685 --> 17:42.978
We have the TV on at work.

17:42.978 --> 17:46.315
I told the girl I work with,
"That's my brother on TV. He looks thin."

17:46.315 --> 17:47.316
- Are you eating?
- Ow.

17:47.941 --> 17:50.903
The Internet said the shark
bit your thing off, but it's not true.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.530
I checked. I mean, I didn't look.
I had the nurses look.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.532
What do you mean, the Internet?

17:56.450 --> 17:57.284
Um...

17:58.243 --> 17:59.953
<i>Help! Help!</i>

18:01.163 --> 18:01.997
<i>Hey!</i>

18:03.123 --> 18:05.959
<i>Ouch. Guess that'll teach him.</i>

18:05.959 --> 18:09.254
<i>The hospital says
the woman's attacker is a local man,</i>

18:09.254 --> 18:11.673
<i>- who police are still hoping to interview.</i>
- Shit.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.760
- Here you go.
You good to walk?

18:14.760 --> 18:17.179
Yeah. Thanks for the ride.
- Wait, wait.

18:21.016 --> 18:25.312
Thank God. I can't believe it.
You're coming to dinner tonight, right?

18:25.979 --> 18:27.106
Mm...

18:27.106 --> 18:28.941
- Right? Yeah? Okay.
- Mm-hm.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.818
- How long are you here for?
- Not long.

18:30.818 --> 18:35.155
No, I have to find this woman,
give her an insurance check, and then...

18:35.155 --> 18:36.365
Yeah, right.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.160
See you tonight.

18:56.135 --> 18:56.969
Hey.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.679
<i>Quick question.</i>

18:58.679 --> 19:01.473
Why did I not know you're from Florida?

19:02.891 --> 19:06.395
- Someone's been on the Internet, huh?
<i>- You, local man.</i>

19:07.479 --> 19:09.857
You know why I think you didn't tell me?

19:10.858 --> 19:11.692
Why?

19:12.734 --> 19:15.654
You didn't want me
knowing where your family is.

19:35.465 --> 19:38.927
Mike Valentine. Wait.
As in Sonny Valentine?

19:38.927 --> 19:41.096
- My father.
- No way.

19:41.638 --> 19:44.308
Sonny's the one that hired me.
Back when he was chief.

19:44.308 --> 19:48.896
No kidding. I'm the guy from the video.
Getting bit by a shark.

19:52.649 --> 19:53.901
No. Just the leg.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.070
- You're in Philly now, huh?
- Yup.

19:57.070 --> 20:00.616
And what exactly
is an independent insurance consultant?

20:00.616 --> 20:05.370
It changes. I'm tracking down this woman.
I have to give her a settlement check.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.372
- What's the name?
- Delly West.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.043
Sorry. I don't know her.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.130
Okay, but maybe you could, uh...?

20:15.130 --> 20:17.591
- Could what?
- Look her up in the system.

20:17.591 --> 20:18.967
System's kind of old.

20:18.967 --> 20:22.387
But, hey,
that's good news about your dick.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.226
Thanks.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.772
Tyler, put that phone away.
I need to find out the homework.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.983
- Find out after dinner. Put it away.
Deacon, honey, turn that TV off.

20:34.983 --> 20:35.901
We have company.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.780
<i>The sinkhole that swallowed
several Orlando businesses last month</i>

20:39.780 --> 20:41.156
<i>is finally stable.</i>

20:41.156 --> 20:44.451
<i>And the city says repairs
can begin by early next week.</i>

20:45.202 --> 20:47.579
Tyler Pitts, put your phone down.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.415
- Fine. I'll fail math.
- Are you failing math?

20:50.415 --> 20:52.459
You better not be. You need math.

20:52.459 --> 20:55.045
- Tell her, Mike.
- I don't know if she needs math or not.

20:55.045 --> 20:58.298
Of course she needs math.
Look at me, what would I do without math?

20:58.298 --> 21:03.303
- I'm not sure what you do anyway, Deacon.
- Well, I am a county surveyor.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.555
I'm working on that sinkhole job.

21:05.555 --> 21:10.686
And you need to know angles and lines
and geometry and measurement.

21:10.686 --> 21:14.064
Surveyors need as much math
as a NASA scientist.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.692
That's just not true.

21:17.734 --> 21:20.404
So do you have to pee sitting down now?

21:20.404 --> 21:23.365
I told you. It did not bite his thing off.
Go to your room.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.500
- I don't have to--
- No. I don't know where she heard that.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.630
Dang. When we came out,
the wind was blowing away from the house.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.425
- Give it a minute.
- No way, I finally got it lit.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.342
Blow on me.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.513
There you go.

21:46.513 --> 21:47.514
Thank you.

21:49.599 --> 21:52.352
You weren't gonna call, were you?
To say you're back in town?

21:53.687 --> 21:54.563
Probably not.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.108
It's okay. I get it.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.027
It's not you.

22:00.610 --> 22:03.530
It's this insurance check thing.
It's a nightmare.

22:04.614 --> 22:06.241
Growing up with our dad,

22:06.241 --> 22:09.786
you probably formed a good instinct
when someone's lying through their teeth.

22:09.786 --> 22:12.664
- Yeah, I guess I did.
- Yeah, me too.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.834
You might wanna work
on that insurance check story.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.172
Sorry.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.134
This woman you're looking for,
does she wanna be found?

22:24.134 --> 22:25.052
No.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.056
Criminal type?

22:31.683 --> 22:33.560
Criminal-adjacent.

22:34.144 --> 22:37.147
Well, then maybe
you should talk to a criminal.

23:04.382 --> 23:05.217
Dad?

23:08.762 --> 23:10.347
It's been a few years.

23:10.847 --> 23:14.184
If I knew you wanted a game of catch,
I would have dug up my old glove.

23:14.810 --> 23:19.064
- You buy RJ's, or take it in a card game?
- Oh, RJ passed of brain cancer.

23:19.064 --> 23:22.776
I thought a nice little bar
would occupy me in my retirement.

23:22.776 --> 23:23.944
Retirement?

23:24.736 --> 23:27.405
Cash business, access to deep water.

23:27.405 --> 23:30.992
- Smuggling is just a hobby now.
- Hey, I retired with honors.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.036
A full police chief pension.

23:33.036 --> 23:35.997
I got my plaque
above my booth at the IHOP.

23:36.581 --> 23:37.582
- Wow.
- How about you?

23:41.128 --> 23:42.796
I keep my ear to the ground.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.591
What is it?
Something about an ethical lapse?

23:48.301 --> 23:50.137
Must make you happy, huh?

23:50.137 --> 23:54.891
- The apple falling right next to the tree.
- No. See, that's where you're wrong.

23:54.891 --> 23:58.562
Every father wants his son
to be better than him.

23:59.521 --> 24:00.939
Not just think he is.

24:02.649 --> 24:05.485
Well, what do you want?
What do you need? Money?

24:05.485 --> 24:08.113
- No. I have a job.
- Which is?

24:08.113 --> 24:09.406
To find a woman.

24:12.659 --> 24:13.869
Delly West.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.915
- What's she doing down here?
- Wish I knew.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.585
What the fuck do you know?

24:22.377 --> 24:24.504
- Not much.
- That's too bad.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.465
A person's habits are their weak spots.

24:27.966 --> 24:32.053
They can change their location,
but they can't change who they are.

24:34.556 --> 24:35.807
You keep those.

24:36.725 --> 24:41.271
Anytime you wanna play that game of catch,
your old man's right here for you.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.860
Relax, you don't need a gun.

24:46.860 --> 24:50.155
It is my duty as an officer of the law
to carry my sidearm.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.741
Okay. Well, maybe
just be normal for today.

24:53.867 --> 24:54.701
Okay?

25:02.626 --> 25:05.295
- You're gonna go find a gun. Aren't you?
- I'll meet you at the castle.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.463
No, that's--

25:07.589 --> 25:10.091
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

25:11.801 --> 25:12.969
Okay, thank you.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.076
Hello?

25:36.660 --> 25:39.287
<i>To be clear,
I'm a stickler for procedure.</i>

25:39.287 --> 25:41.581
What's right and what's not.

25:41.581 --> 25:44.084
Ethics, Miranda, and so on.

25:44.709 --> 25:45.627
Understood.

25:46.795 --> 25:50.590
Out of respect for the chief,
who, after all, gave me my start,

25:51.174 --> 25:54.386
I had some men
look for this missing woman's BMW.

25:56.179 --> 26:00.642
But first, that "insurance check" story,
it just embarrasses you.

26:01.309 --> 26:04.396
My employer is concerned
for the woman's safety.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.939
Well, so am I.

26:07.315 --> 26:10.151
I can assure you
she's safer being found by me

26:10.151 --> 26:12.195
than by the next one who tries if I don't.

26:23.456 --> 26:24.582
<i>Nice car.</i>

26:24.582 --> 26:28.545
Yeah, just came in. Great mileage.
It's as new as any new car you can buy.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.380
- Mind if I look inside?
- Yeah.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.883
- You can see, nearly new.
- Yeah.

26:35.510 --> 26:39.889
- Previous owner buy something else?
- Yeah, I put her in a 2016 Lexus.

26:39.889 --> 26:41.683
A lot of leg room, huh?

26:41.683 --> 26:43.351
Not a bug on the bumper.

26:54.988 --> 26:57.073
No one cares about punctuation anymore.

27:00.577 --> 27:02.370
- Hey.
<i>Gotta ask you something.</i>

27:02.370 --> 27:03.830
<i>Yeah?</i>

27:03.830 --> 27:06.666
You heard about the dismembered body
that turned up in the sewer?

27:07.334 --> 27:09.210
- What a waste?
- What?

27:09.210 --> 27:12.088
I thought you were telling a joke.
No, I didn't hear.

27:13.298 --> 27:16.217
<i>Someone dumped a body in
a storm drain. They brought me in on it.</i>

27:17.052 --> 27:20.930
<i>Are you in Homicide now?
- No. The vic ID'd as Gil Franco.</i>

27:25.268 --> 27:26.561
<i>Mike.</i>
- Mm-hm?

27:26.561 --> 27:28.772
Gilbert Franco. Do you know him?

27:30.065 --> 27:31.733
Yeah. He was in the program.

27:31.733 --> 27:34.319
<i>Yeah, I know. His ex-wife said.</i>

27:35.403 --> 27:36.488
How did he die?

27:36.488 --> 27:37.489
Still waiting.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.325
But being chopped up didn't help any.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.036
She said he owed Moss Yankov.

27:44.204 --> 27:47.707
Which answers my involvement.
You wanna tell me about yours?

27:49.417 --> 27:50.668
I don't have any.

27:50.668 --> 27:52.879
<i>So why don't you come down here
and tell me who might.</i>

27:52.879 --> 27:54.214
I can't. I'm not in Philly.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.131
Where are you?

27:55.673 --> 27:57.717
<i>- I had to go to Florida.</i>
- Why?

27:57.717 --> 28:00.053
So I can leave Florida.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.429
<i>I don't like how you sound.</i>

28:01.429 --> 28:02.931
Did you see your father?

28:02.931 --> 28:04.808
<i>It's fine. Trust me. Talk to you later.</i>

28:24.619 --> 28:26.121
Are you a gambling man?

28:27.247 --> 28:28.623
Man before you left it.

28:42.679 --> 28:43.513
No, thank you.

29:22.677 --> 29:25.638
<i>Yeah?</i>
- Did you kill Gil Franco?

29:25.638 --> 29:26.806
What the fuck?

29:26.806 --> 29:29.934
Uh, why would you ask me that
on the phone?

29:29.934 --> 29:30.852
We had a deal.

29:31.436 --> 29:35.565
I get guys to pay up, no one gets hurt,
and definitely not chopped up dead.

29:35.565 --> 29:39.778
<i>Look, any contracting
or consulting work between us,</i>

29:39.778 --> 29:43.364
<i>like for services
of certain entirely legal natures,</i>

29:43.364 --> 29:45.116
<i>in as much as they put the, um--</i>

29:45.742 --> 29:47.911
<i>What do you call it? The onus--</i>

29:47.911 --> 29:52.165
<i>- Moss, is this your first phone call?</i>
- I don't know about anyone getting killed.

29:52.165 --> 29:55.460
Stop asking questions I don't know
and just do what I sent you to do.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.796
<i>Okay, Moss. Okay. Okay.</i>

29:57.796 --> 30:01.925
I'll get Delly back to you,
if it's the last thing I do.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.595
Well, thank you.

30:05.595 --> 30:08.306
<i>Now, if it's the last thing I do for you,</i>

30:08.306 --> 30:11.100
I do this, we're square. My entire debt.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.062
<i>I bring her back,
I walk away clean forever.</i>

30:14.062 --> 30:16.272
<i>- Yes or no?</i>
- Fine.

30:16.272 --> 30:19.150
To be clear,
next time you threaten my family,

30:19.150 --> 30:23.363
we'll be able to swap parts of you
and Gil Franco like Mr. Potato Head.

30:23.863 --> 30:24.697
Good?

31:56.039 --> 31:56.956
<i>Mike?</i>

31:59.167 --> 32:00.376
You wanna get away?

33:34.262 --> 33:37.765
<i>♪ Just strive for balance in life... ♪</i>

33:41.477 --> 33:42.437
Yeah.

33:43.521 --> 33:44.939
Okay. Got it.

33:48.067 --> 33:52.238
<i>♪ Celebrate your talents in life ♪</i>

33:53.614 --> 33:56.784
<i>♪ Inside that strength from inside... ♪</i>

34:12.759 --> 34:13.926
You've got books.

34:14.510 --> 34:15.344
Yeah.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.723
In case I ever learn how to read.

34:19.432 --> 34:20.433
You laugh.

34:20.433 --> 34:23.644
Most of Moss's guys
couldn't even read a stop sign.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.314
It's why I'm not gonna work for him long.

34:26.314 --> 34:30.109
What makes you think
your fortunes are due for a turn?

34:31.569 --> 34:33.071
I'm not gambling anymore.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.659
You don't think so, huh?

34:43.081 --> 34:44.582
This was a mistake.

34:45.541 --> 34:47.335
That's the title of my biography.

34:48.419 --> 34:50.421
It's not gonna happen again, okay?

34:53.591 --> 34:54.592
You wanna bet?

35:20.701 --> 35:22.829
<i>Moss?</i>
- You have her?

35:23.371 --> 35:24.372
<i>Not at the moment. No.</i>

35:24.372 --> 35:25.289
<i>You saw her?</i>

35:26.374 --> 35:27.375
I have her phone.

35:28.042 --> 35:28.876
<i>What?</i>

35:30.169 --> 35:33.840
- Her face unlocks it. You know the code?
- How do you have her phone and not her?

35:33.840 --> 35:35.174
<i>She left it in a bar.</i>

35:35.174 --> 35:39.137
- Why do you need to get into her phone?
- You don't wanna know why she's here?

35:40.138 --> 35:41.764
Who she's been talking to?

35:42.265 --> 35:45.434
- Why? Is she talking to someone?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

35:45.434 --> 35:48.187
<i>- That's why I wanna get into her phone.</i>
- What? Like a guy?

35:48.187 --> 35:51.691
<i>- I said I don't know.</i>
- So get into her phone and find out.

35:51.691 --> 35:54.735
It needs her face to unlock it.
You know the code?

35:54.735 --> 35:57.446
<i>Try M-O-S-S.</i>

35:57.446 --> 36:00.700
- Oh, sure, but what if it's not?
- I don't know. Jesus Christ.

36:00.700 --> 36:03.494
You're the detective. Fucking detect.

36:15.256 --> 36:19.218
- You're sure it was this cottage?
- Yes, the shots came from here.

36:23.264 --> 36:27.685
Because sound is kind of funny at night.
Maybe it was one of the others.

36:27.685 --> 36:28.728
Well, maybe.

36:28.728 --> 36:31.022
I've only owned this property
for 20 years,

36:31.022 --> 36:33.191
so maybe I don't have my bearings.

36:34.859 --> 36:38.779
Would you care if I looked into a few
just to ease my mind?

36:38.779 --> 36:42.575
No. Peace of mind is what we offer here.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.535
But I'm telling you what I saw.

36:45.036 --> 36:49.665
The man ran out, the ambulance came,
and then they took that poor girl out.

36:49.665 --> 36:54.212
- And this man? You saw him yourself?
- Yes. Not ten feet away from my window.

36:55.463 --> 36:59.133
If I got a police sketch artist,
you'd be able to talk to him.

36:59.133 --> 37:04.847
Uh, well, my son Charles says that I can
talk the bark off of a pine tree, so...

37:05.389 --> 37:08.434
He's in Atlanta.
He's been there a couple years now.

37:08.434 --> 37:13.606
He's there because of that Kathy,
and I don't think they're very happy.

37:13.606 --> 37:18.069
But it's their life
and all I can do is wish them well

37:18.611 --> 37:20.738
and hope she doesn't get pregnant.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.077
That's a yes.

37:30.873 --> 37:31.707
Buzz?

37:32.458 --> 37:35.586
- What are you shooting at?
- Don't know. Manatee maybe.

37:36.295 --> 37:39.674
- You can't shoot manatees.
- Not with this piece of shit.

37:41.634 --> 37:43.302
You looking for a charter?

37:43.302 --> 37:45.388
I can give you
the friends and family rate.

37:45.388 --> 37:49.392
A lot of engines. How fast do the fish
move around here anyway?

37:49.392 --> 37:52.561
You used to like going fast
when you were a kid.

37:52.561 --> 37:55.398
Remember the Speedway cars
at Disney World?

37:56.274 --> 37:58.985
Heard anything about a shooting
on the beachside last night?

37:58.985 --> 38:01.195
- Why would I?
- You have a scanner.

38:01.195 --> 38:04.448
You can't always be monitoring
the DEA or Coast Guard.

38:04.448 --> 38:06.909
Nothing special,
just another night in paradise. Why?

38:06.909 --> 38:09.954
A woman was found shot to death
and there's nothing in the news.

38:10.913 --> 38:13.666
Maybe you wanna know
if you were spotted, huh?

38:14.959 --> 38:17.628
- Where would that be?
- The Salt-Air Bungalows.

38:18.504 --> 38:21.173
Okay. So you're following me.

38:21.173 --> 38:24.427
Me, personally, no,
I can't stay up that late.

38:24.927 --> 38:26.429
Why have me followed?

38:27.096 --> 38:30.975
You're my son. I care about you.
That's what fathers do.

38:32.393 --> 38:34.228
"That's what fathers do."

38:37.481 --> 38:40.401
Collections are down,
that's probably 'cause Mike's not here.

38:40.401 --> 38:44.196
The guy's got a touch.
So the line moved on the Phillies game.

38:44.196 --> 38:46.449
Did Delly fuck around on me?

38:46.449 --> 38:48.034
What?

38:48.951 --> 38:52.371
- Did Delly--?
- No. Well-- How would I know?

38:53.039 --> 38:54.457
You never saw anything?

38:54.457 --> 38:57.877
What would I see? I'm never with Delly.
Mike's the only one who drove her.

39:04.467 --> 39:05.301
Hey there.

39:06.302 --> 39:09.847
- This woman was in here last night.
- Okay. What about her?

39:09.847 --> 39:11.098
She's dead.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.518
She was just alive.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.854
That's usually the order of it. Yeah.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.522
I'd look at the boyfriend.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.441
What boyfriend?

39:20.441 --> 39:23.486
It's usually the boyfriend that did it.
Or husband.

39:23.486 --> 39:27.698
Or maybe she was seeing a married guy,
he said he'd leave his wife, he didn't.

39:27.698 --> 39:31.118
Then this girl threatened to tell her
and he freaked out.

39:31.118 --> 39:32.161
Dead.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.538
Very helpful. Thank you.

39:34.538 --> 39:35.456
You got it.

39:35.456 --> 39:38.209
<i>We'll have more
on that stolen ambulance chase</i>

39:38.209 --> 39:42.546
<i>that led to the arrest of one man
and put another in the hospital.</i>

39:43.089 --> 39:46.133

39:48.386 --> 39:51.097

39:51.097 --> 39:53.349
<i>where he collided

39:53.349 --> 39:56.143

39:56.143 --> 40:00.398

40:02.191 --> 40:06.946
<i>No word on whether anyone was being

40:18.207 --> 40:19.542
Excuse me?

40:19.542 --> 40:20.668
Oh, I'm sorry.

40:21.919 --> 40:22.795
Please, go.

40:30.761 --> 40:33.222
- Hey, so sorry about that.
- It's okay.

40:33.222 --> 40:34.473
Oh, yes, you're--

40:34.473 --> 40:36.600
- I'm Mike.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.061
- Nice to meet you.
- From Washington, D.C.

40:39.061 --> 40:40.312
Oh?

40:41.480 --> 40:43.482
U.S. Department of Transportation.

40:43.482 --> 40:46.569
Specifically, Highway Traffic
Safety Administration.

40:46.569 --> 40:50.573
More specifically, the Emergency
Transport Services Division.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.283
- Your taxes at work.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.661
- What brings you here?
- I'd love to tell you.

40:55.661 --> 40:57.413
Uh, breakfast tomorrow?

40:57.413 --> 40:58.497
Perfect.

40:59.915 --> 41:01.876
- I'll be in touch.
- Please do.

41:05.671 --> 41:08.048
Ty, why can't you just do your homework?

41:08.048 --> 41:10.301
The counselor at school
says I need incentives.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.219
- What incentives?
- I want a conure.

41:12.219 --> 41:14.346
- What's a conure?
- It's a parrot.

41:14.346 --> 41:17.516
No. No parrots.
They live forever and you won't feed it.

41:17.516 --> 41:20.853
I will so.
- Oh, really? Why don't we ask Paul Bunyan?

41:20.853 --> 41:21.979
I was six.

41:21.979 --> 41:24.565
Patsy, where's the shovel?
We're gonna dig up a hamster.

41:24.565 --> 41:27.318
Mom! Mom, he's doing it again.

41:27.818 --> 41:29.695
It's okay. I hid the shovel.

41:29.695 --> 41:30.613
A hamster?

41:34.033 --> 41:34.867
Hey.

41:38.245 --> 41:39.288
What you doing?

41:39.288 --> 41:41.332
I have an app
that tracks the space station.

41:42.166 --> 41:45.252
- You can see the space station?
- Yeah, in a couple minutes.

41:50.883 --> 41:51.842
So?

41:52.510 --> 41:56.931
So Mom brought you all the way
from Philadelphia to ask if I'm on drugs?

41:58.265 --> 41:59.099
I get it.

41:59.808 --> 42:01.560
You don't need some guy you don't know

42:01.560 --> 42:03.854
coming here every five years
to give you advice.

42:03.854 --> 42:04.772
It's okay.

42:04.772 --> 42:07.733
If you can get my mom on that schedule,
you'd be my best friend.

42:10.110 --> 42:11.946
But is everything okay?

42:11.946 --> 42:12.947
It's fine.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.575
I mean, it sucks, but in a normal way.

42:18.494 --> 42:19.495
Good.

42:22.414 --> 42:23.249
It's here.

42:23.874 --> 42:24.708
Where?

42:27.086 --> 42:28.045
Wow.

42:28.045 --> 42:29.004
Right?

42:29.755 --> 42:32.466
There's people in there.
- I know.

42:32.466 --> 42:34.552
They're in constant free fall.

42:39.306 --> 42:40.432
<i>I know the feeling.</i>

42:56.699 --> 42:58.951
I'm gonna go watch <i>The Bachelor.</i>
- Don't do drugs.

42:58.951 --> 42:59.868
Got it.

43:14.592 --> 43:15.718
Hey.

43:15.718 --> 43:17.720
<i>Know what I'm looking at right now?</i>

43:17.720 --> 43:20.514
Picture of Gil Franco's boat. Guess where?

43:21.223 --> 43:22.766
<i>- No idea.</i>
- Florida.

43:24.435 --> 43:25.269
Okay.

43:26.353 --> 43:29.023
<i>- How far is Port Orange from you?</i>
- Not very.

43:29.023 --> 43:30.566
<i>Okay, so you knew Gil.</i>

43:30.566 --> 43:33.193
<i>Gil had a boat in Florida
where you are now.</i>

43:33.861 --> 43:35.863
<i>I don't know what the boat means.</i>

43:35.863 --> 43:37.865
Right now I don't know
what anything means.

43:37.865 --> 43:40.618
<i>Just tell me
why you're in Florida, please.</i>

43:40.618 --> 43:43.287
- Business.
<i>- Moss Yankov business?</i>

43:44.121 --> 43:45.581
Not Gil Franco business.

43:46.206 --> 43:49.293
<i>But you can send a picture of the boat
and I'll tell you what I find.</i>

43:49.293 --> 43:50.878
Let you investigate?

43:50.878 --> 43:53.172
Well, you wanted my help.

43:53.172 --> 43:54.089
<i>Fine.</i>

43:54.089 --> 43:56.967
But you fuck me over,
I will bring you down.

43:56.967 --> 43:59.428
Oh, nice. You remember our wedding vows.

44:01.805 --> 44:05.184
- Morning, Andy. Here you go.
- Morning, Lacey. What's this?

44:05.184 --> 44:07.728
That's Toothless.
The dragon from that dragon movie.

44:07.728 --> 44:11.231
You paid Officer Thompson to draw
the suspect in the bungalow shooting.

44:11.231 --> 44:12.900
And this is what she drew?

44:12.900 --> 44:16.362
No, that one I left on your desk.
This is to show you that I can draw too.

44:16.362 --> 44:19.865
- If you're gonna pay someone.
- Thank you. That's helpful.

44:30.167 --> 44:32.002
- Chief.
- Andy.

44:32.002 --> 44:33.170
Breakfast?

44:33.962 --> 44:35.381
No, no, no. No, thanks.

44:36.924 --> 44:39.593
I need to know what you know
about your son's involvement

44:39.593 --> 44:41.470
in a shooting two nights ago.

44:41.470 --> 44:44.223
Not a thing. Coffee at least?

44:46.225 --> 44:50.020
This guy was seen
at the Salt-Air Bungalows that night

44:50.020 --> 44:52.064
around the time of gunshots.

44:55.067 --> 44:56.276
Chief, that's Mike.

44:58.362 --> 44:59.279
That's not him.

45:06.578 --> 45:09.998
Chief, a few days ago
you had me look for a woman,

45:09.998 --> 45:12.751
and now a woman matching
that same description

45:12.751 --> 45:17.506
was in a bungalow where shots were fired
and Mike was seen there with a gun.

45:17.506 --> 45:21.468
- So somebody saw Mike shoot this woman?
- Not saw him do it. No.

45:22.094 --> 45:23.637
Prints? Evidence of a struggle?

45:23.637 --> 45:27.224
- They'd cleaned up before I arrived.
- Anybody ID the victim?

45:27.224 --> 45:29.351
- As of yet, no, because--
- Because?

45:31.103 --> 45:34.231
Because we don't have one yet.

45:34.940 --> 45:35.774
Hmm.

45:36.483 --> 45:37.818
So to clarify...

45:39.820 --> 45:41.238
there's a woman who isn't dead,

45:41.864 --> 45:44.241
and you want to investigate Mike
for not killing her?

45:48.120 --> 45:51.123
I don't know exactly
what happened yet. No.

45:51.748 --> 45:52.708
But I will.

45:53.834 --> 45:54.751
And, chief...

45:55.711 --> 45:59.047
I've done plenty of looking the other way.
You know that.

45:59.047 --> 46:03.260
I've looked the other way so much
I have a permanent crick in my neck.

46:04.011 --> 46:07.014
So you know I'm loyal to you
and I will always be grateful...

46:07.890 --> 46:09.141
to a point.

46:11.226 --> 46:12.644
Thanks for coming, Andy.

46:22.488 --> 46:26.200
I'm negotiating to get a segment at
the end of the news where I do opinions.

46:26.200 --> 46:28.118
I'm calling it "Crazy like a Fox."

46:28.118 --> 46:30.913
- That's good.
- I wanna do investigative pieces.

46:30.913 --> 46:33.165
Coming out of University of Georgia,
that was the plan,

46:33.165 --> 46:37.961
but everyone kept steering me to on-air
because of how I look. I finally gave in.

46:38.462 --> 46:40.839
It's a lot harder
for attractive people to get ahead.

46:40.839 --> 46:43.509
I'm sure.
But maybe that's where I come in.

46:44.551 --> 46:47.137
- Oh?
- Remember that stolen ambulance story?

46:47.137 --> 46:50.474
If it's what I think,
we're talking about national news.

46:50.474 --> 46:53.185
I don't know
if you even do national stories.

46:53.185 --> 46:56.396
- No, we do. I do. Me, yeah.
- Then I can give you the--

46:56.396 --> 46:59.399
What's the word you have in your business?

47:00.609 --> 47:02.778
- The exclusive.
- That's the one.

47:02.778 --> 47:06.240
If you can get me the footage
from where that stolen ambulance stopped.

47:06.740 --> 47:07.616
Of course.

47:08.909 --> 47:09.910
To a big story.

47:11.370 --> 47:12.412
Huge.

47:21.171 --> 47:22.548
<i>We can't do this again.</i>

47:22.548 --> 47:24.383
Oh, geez, here we go.

47:24.383 --> 47:25.801
No, I mean it.

47:25.801 --> 47:29.638
I'm trying to do the right thing
and I keep doing the wrong one.

47:30.514 --> 47:33.350
Which weirdly are the exact instructions
for how people like us

47:33.350 --> 47:35.769
- end up with Moss Yankov.
- What?

47:35.769 --> 47:39.398
I'm sorry, I haven't ended up anywhere.
I'm getting out.

47:39.398 --> 47:41.441
You choose to stay, not me.

47:41.441 --> 47:45.821
Okay, if I may, your lordship,
go fuck yourself.

47:48.824 --> 47:50.909
We got here the exact same way.

47:50.909 --> 47:53.912
Moss offered something, we took it,
and now we're paying it back.

47:56.748 --> 47:58.333
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

48:00.794 --> 48:01.962
But not forever.

48:04.881 --> 48:06.508
- Not forever.
- No.

48:07.926 --> 48:08.969
Not forever.

What the fuck?

49:33.845 --> 49:35.681
Police know you were at the bungalows.

49:37.391 --> 49:40.268
- Because you told them?
- No, because they got a sketch.

49:41.561 --> 49:45.232
It doesn't quite catch that superior look
in your eye, but it's a fair likeness.

49:45.232 --> 49:47.401
- She was already dead.
- Good.

49:47.401 --> 49:49.069
Practice that.

49:49.069 --> 49:51.154
You came to warn me. Why?

49:52.823 --> 49:54.408
Give you a head start.

49:56.076 --> 49:58.620
Because of that protective instinct
you're so famous for?

49:58.620 --> 50:01.957
How about so you don't bring your trouble
into my neighborhood?

50:01.957 --> 50:04.251
I am bringing you trouble?
Are you kidding me?

50:04.251 --> 50:06.420
And whatever this gangster shit
you're into--

50:06.420 --> 50:08.672
Is interfering with your gangster shit?

50:09.840 --> 50:13.468
When you were a little kid, you used
to like riding those cars in Tomorrowland.

50:13.468 --> 50:16.430
You know why? Because they were on tracks.

50:16.430 --> 50:18.390
- You needed that.
- Motherfucker.

50:18.390 --> 50:20.976
They told you where you could go,
where you couldn't go.

50:20.976 --> 50:22.394
Your mother knew that.

50:22.936 --> 50:24.104
You don't talk about her.

50:24.104 --> 50:26.898
That's why she took you to church,
taught you all the rules.

50:26.898 --> 50:30.068
- You don't get to say her name.
- You need to leave.

50:30.068 --> 50:33.405
Okay? Because you don't have a compass
and Florida doesn't have tracks.

50:33.405 --> 50:35.031
That is a bad combination.

50:35.031 --> 50:37.117
This ain't Disney World anymore.

50:37.117 --> 50:40.120
This is the realest
goddamn place on Earth.

50:40.120 --> 50:44.374
I don't care how they cleaned up
that crime scene, there's always evidence.

50:44.374 --> 50:45.292
Dad, wait.

50:46.793 --> 50:49.796
- The scene was cleaned up?
- Andy said, yeah.

50:53.091 --> 50:54.926
She was never in the ambulance.

50:54.926 --> 50:55.844
<i>What?</i>

50:56.344 --> 51:00.056
<i>She was never in the ambulance
because they disposed of the body.</i>

51:00.056 --> 51:02.017
<i>Fuck. The scene was cleaned up.</i>

51:02.017 --> 51:05.061
- It was a professional job.
- What the fuck you talking about?

51:06.271 --> 51:07.189
Yeah?

51:07.189 --> 51:08.607
She's dead.

51:13.236 --> 51:14.112
Dead?

51:14.112 --> 51:16.281
Oh, now act surprised. Go ahead.

51:18.617 --> 51:19.785
Delly is dead?

51:21.077 --> 51:23.205
A professional job. A hit.

51:23.205 --> 51:25.791
- Who?
<i>- Who? You tell me.</i>

51:25.791 --> 51:28.752
You tell me 'cause I don't know
any mobsters in Coronado Beach,

51:28.752 --> 51:30.962
but I do know one in Philadelphia.

51:30.962 --> 51:32.422
Me? Fuck you!

51:32.422 --> 51:34.758
No, fuck you.
You said you can't let her get away.

51:34.758 --> 51:37.552
That's two times now
you said I killed someone.

51:37.552 --> 51:39.346
Two times you didn't deny it.

51:39.346 --> 51:41.640
<i>Well, what does "fuck you" mean
in your language?</i>

51:41.640 --> 51:44.100
I didn't kill her. Maybe you killed her.

51:44.851 --> 51:47.270
Me? Why? Why would I kill her?

51:47.270 --> 51:51.316
- She was my way out of debt.
<i>- Why would I kill her? I love her!</i>

51:56.363 --> 51:57.197
<i>Mike?</i>

52:02.786 --> 52:04.329
<i>- Hey.</i>
- I'll call you back.

52:08.208 --> 52:09.668
