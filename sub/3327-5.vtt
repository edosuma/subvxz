00:13.240 --> 00:16.368
WATSON: How do you
know this guy again?

00:16.410 --> 00:18.298
First time we've met, actually.

00:18.350 --> 00:20.272
Bit odd, I know.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.311
Postmortem bruising experiments

00:22.350 --> 00:24.318
are more of
a third date activity.

00:24.350 --> 00:26.284
No, I meant
the attendant.

00:26.320 --> 00:27.753
You said he's a friend of yours.

00:27.790 --> 00:29.428
We frequent the same
beekeeping chat room.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.280
He has an impressive collection
of Caucasians.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.453
Species of bee.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.321
Course it is.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.634
_ This is
Important work, Watson.

00:39.670 --> 00:41.763
It's crucial to my work

00:41.800 --> 00:43.836
as an investigator.

00:43.870 --> 00:46.100
_The_se nameless
IndIVIduals agree,

00:46.140 --> 00:48.301
which is why they have donated
their bodies to science.

00:48.340 --> 00:51.446
Now help me roll this one over,
so I can try a chokehold.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.745
I did say you were free not to
join me for these experiments.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.246
I know.

00:58.290 --> 01:00.315
It's hardly surprising
that being in a hospital

01:00.360 --> 01:01.156
makes you uncomfortable,

01:01.190 --> 01:03.181
you being
a disgraced surgeon and all.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.380
I'm fine, okay?
You've had your arms crossed

01:05.430 --> 01:07.295
for 13 of the 15 minutes
that we've been here.

01:07.330 --> 01:08.228
It's a classic
self-comforting posture,

01:08.260 --> 01:09.864
an attempt to neutralize
the distress signals

01:09.900 --> 01:11.219
being sent by
your limbic system.

01:11.270 --> 01:13.295
Of course, it is possible
that your stress

01:13.340 --> 01:15.092
is subconscious and you really
do believe that you're fine.

01:15.140 --> 01:18.132
But given that your eyes
are doing that thing they do

01:18.170 --> 01:19.501
when you lie, I sincerely
doubt that's the case.

01:19.540 --> 01:20.700
I'm not lying.
Doing it again.

01:20.740 --> 01:22.674
Okay, I go where you go,
remember?

01:22.710 --> 01:24.268
My comfort doesn't
factor in here.

01:24.310 --> 01:26.312
If it did, I would not
have bought tickets

01:26.350 --> 01:28.272
to the Arms and Armor
exhibit at the Met today.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.618
Yes, they're displaying
new examples of lorica squamata.

01:30.650 --> 01:31.742
Should be quite fascinating.

01:31.790 --> 01:33.382
Just keep an eye on the clock.

01:33.420 --> 01:34.819
If we don't leave in 20,
we're gonna be late.

01:40.260 --> 01:42.160
Thank you, Bruce.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.589
Good luck with
the new hive.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.737
This body--
when's it being autopsied?

01:50.770 --> 01:52.738
Never. Funeral home's
picking hIm up soon.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.179
Died about an hour ago.

01:54.210 --> 01:55.632
From a heart attack.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.238
Yeah. How'd you know that?

01:57.280 --> 01:59.748
There's a tiny blue dot
on the patient's head,

01:59.780 --> 02:01.316
just below the hairline.

02:01.350 --> 02:03.318
That's a_ta_ttoo used to
target radiation treatment,

02:03.350 --> 02:05.341
which means the patient
had brain cancer;

02:05.390 --> 02:07.358
blood clots a_re _
a common complication.

02:07.390 --> 02:09.688
He threw a clot, which led
to a pulmonary embolism,

02:09.730 --> 02:11.379
which led to a heart attack.

02:11.430 --> 02:13.318
Huh. We're in agreement
on the heart attack.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.351
As to how it happened,
you're completely off base.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.322
What room was he
in when he died?

02:17.370 --> 02:19.122
Um, 704.

02:20.870 --> 02:22.360
Where are you going?

02:22.410 --> 02:23.707
The heart attack was
intended to look natural,

02:23.740 --> 02:24.707
but it was induced
with epinephrine.

02:24.740 --> 02:26.469
You've got it backwards.

02:26.510 --> 02:28.432
Epinephrine is adrenaline;
it's given in all cardiac codes.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.469
That's why it's perfect.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.375
Excuse me.
The man who died in this room--

02:32.420 --> 02:34.274
was there anybody with him
when the code thingy went off?

02:34.320 --> 02:35.344
No.

02:35.380 --> 02:36.642
Sir, that room
is being...

02:36.690 --> 02:37.884
Stop cleaning immediately.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.387
Don't touch anything else.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.429
Who are you?

02:44.730 --> 02:45.879
HOLMES: You should
probably take care of that

02:45.930 --> 02:47.329
before somebody
slips and falls.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.225
What is wrong with you?

02:51.270 --> 02:52.862
How about you explain
what's going on

02:52.900 --> 02:54.868
before he lets himself
backin?

02:56.740 --> 02:58.765
Note the mark
on the dead man's finger.

02:58.810 --> 03:00.402
Care to identify it?

03:00.440 --> 03:01.338
It's ischemia.

03:01.380 --> 03:02.677
Tissue death due to constriction

03:02.710 --> 03:04.348
in the blood vessels
in the elbow.

03:04.380 --> 03:06.610
Probably caused by the
epinephrine going into his arm.

03:06.650 --> 03:08.971
And if he only received
the epinephrine during the code,

03:09.020 --> 03:10.647
after his heart had stopped...

03:10.690 --> 03:14.649
It wouldn't have had time
to cause the ischemia.

03:14.690 --> 03:16.487
So, as far as
what's going on, Watson,

03:16.530 --> 03:18.521
we're investigating a murder.

03:41.650 --> 03:42.617
Sir, please open the door!

03:42.650 --> 03:43.810
We should let them in.

03:43.850 --> 03:45.249
We can explain.
While we explain,

03:45.290 --> 03:46.484
they will ruin
our crime scene.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.454
Lend me your former
expertise, come on.

03:48.490 --> 03:50.958
The nurse said the victim
was alone when he coded,

03:50.990 --> 03:52.526
but epinephrine
is fast-acting.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.858
So, how did our killer
buy himself time to escape

03:54.900 --> 03:57.869
before the onset of
the heart attack?

03:57.900 --> 04:00.789
Well, if he injected
the epi into the I.V.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.865
and then lowered the rate
on the infu5ion pump,

04:02.910 --> 04:04.605
he would have at
least ten minutes

04:04.640 --> 04:06.870
before the
paﬁentcoded.

04:06.910 --> 04:10.277
It appears to be set
at 40cc's an hour.

04:10.310 --> 04:12.471
That's just basic maintenance
fluid-- water, dextrose.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.943
There's no reason it should be
slower than 100cc's.

04:14.980 --> 04:16.538
Someone did turn the pump down.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.444
Then we have
our method.

04:18.490 --> 04:19.650
(pounding on door)
MAN: All right, we're coming in!

04:19.690 --> 04:21.612
Sherlock, they're gonna
break down the door.

04:21.660 --> 04:24.584
Yeah, well, saves us the
bother of opening it.

04:24.630 --> 04:26.325
I can live with missing
the squamata at the Met,

04:26.360 --> 04:28.555
but I'd rather
not get arrested.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.658
MAN:
We're coming in!

04:35.640 --> 04:38.006
Gentlemen, could one of you
point me in the direction

04:38.040 --> 04:40.031
of the administrator's office?

04:42.380 --> 04:43.404
This is ridiculous.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.577
We're wasting
valuable time.

04:45.610 --> 04:47.578
Just be glad the captain
got here when he did.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.315
You could've ended up
in the psych ward.

04:49.350 --> 04:50.487
Sure you'd have
been devastated.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.488
Joanie?

04:53.520 --> 04:54.748
Carrie, hi.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.428
I didn't know you
were working here.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.781
It's been, what,
about a year and a half?

04:58.830 --> 05:00.457
Isn't this a small world?

05:00.500 --> 05:02.661
Carrie, this is my
friend Sherlock Holmes.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.463
Sherlock, this is
Dr. Carrie Dwyer.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.092
Hey.
We used to
work together.

05:06.130 --> 05:08.360
Interesting that she didn't
refer to you as her friend.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.004
Probably because of
your falling out.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.598
You call her by
a familiar nickname and yet

05:11.640 --> 05:13.437
you haven't spoken
in a year and a half.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.573
What was it
that drove you two apart?

05:15.610 --> 05:16.599
A man, job?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.049
Failed sapphic dalliance?

05:18.080 --> 05:19.445
Fingers crossed
for the last one.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.072
He's got a form
of Tourette's.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.783
Are you interviewing for
the spot in Cardiothoracic?

05:24.820 --> 05:27.118
No, actually,
I'm done with medicine.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.084
I thought your suspension
was only for a couple months?

05:30.130 --> 05:31.085
It was.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.894
I decided to move on.

05:33.930 --> 05:34.954
Holmes.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.422
It was good seeing you again.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.461
Yeah, you, too.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.503
Holmes, Ms. Watson,
this is Mr. Sanchez.

05:43.540 --> 05:46.065
Administrator, correct?

05:46.110 --> 05:47.532
Aka the guy who's still not
convinced he shouldn't

05:47.580 --> 05:48.774
press charges against you for

05:48.810 --> 05:50.471
barricading yourself
in one of our rooms.

05:50.510 --> 05:52.478
And what's your role here?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.545
Do you reach things
off high shelves for this one?

05:54.580 --> 05:58.641
I'm Dr. Baldwin, I'm
the Head of Surgery.

05:58.690 --> 06:01.113
And you were treating
the dead man?

06:01.160 --> 06:02.627
No, but seeing as
he was pre-surgical,

06:02.660 --> 06:04.582
it does fall under my
departmental purview.

06:04.630 --> 06:06.655
All right, here's how things
are gonna shake out here.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.850
Once you apologize
to Mr. Sanchez...

06:08.900 --> 06:11.664
Apologize? I alerted him
to a murder at his hospital.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.635
Once you've apologized
to Mr. Sanchez,

06:14.670 --> 06:16.661
he'll release the
body to our M.E.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.065
and allow CSU full
access to the room.

06:19.110 --> 06:20.134
That's it?

06:20.180 --> 06:21.408
You should
count yourself lucky

06:21.440 --> 06:22.805
you're getting that much.

06:22.850 --> 06:23.839
We need the dead man's name,

06:23.880 --> 06:25.507
access to his medical records.

06:25.550 --> 06:28.041
It would be a flagrant violation
of HIPAA guidelines.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.809
Not to mention
the patient's privacy.

06:29.850 --> 06:31.647
He's dead; do you think
he's worried about his privacy?

06:32.790 --> 06:35.850
Holmes.

06:35.890 --> 06:38.051
(siren whoops)

06:38.090 --> 06:40.820
Can't believe I had to apologize
to that pencil-pusher.

06:40.860 --> 06:42.725
Would you have preferred
he press charges?

06:42.770 --> 06:44.567
Why are you in such a hurry?

06:44.600 --> 06:46.192
We need to find
the woman.

06:46.230 --> 06:48.698
The one who brought the victim
coffee before he was murdered.

06:48.740 --> 06:50.469
There were _two coffee
cups in his trash.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.705
One of them had lipstick
on the lid.

06:52.740 --> 06:56.107
Obviously a woman brought him
coffee shortly before he died.

06:56.140 --> 06:58.108
You think she killed him?
It's possible.

06:58.150 --> 07:00.641
At the very least, she might
be able to tell us his name!

07:00.680 --> 07:02.489
But we don't know
anything about her.

07:02.520 --> 07:03.987
No, but Dave might.

07:04.020 --> 07:05.612
Who's Dave?

07:05.650 --> 07:07.117
It's from a place
called Think Coffee.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.650
The barista,
Dave, put his name

07:08.690 --> 07:10.624
and number on the back.
Number's smudged,

07:10.660 --> 07:12.082
_so we can't call
him, unfortunately.

07:14.030 --> 07:16.521
Well, how do you know Dave was
a barista and not a customer?

07:16.570 --> 07:18.959
Well, the receipt says she was
charged for two small coffees,

07:19.000 --> 07:20.797
she received
two large.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.707
Dave was flirting.

07:23.740 --> 07:25.867
Tall half-skinny,
half-two-percent, extra hot,

07:25.910 --> 07:29.129
split quad shot latte
with whip.

07:29.180 --> 07:33.844
These coffee orders-- the Magna
Carta was less complicated.

07:33.880 --> 07:37.589
Quite informative running into
your former friend, Carrie.

07:37.620 --> 07:39.986
You'd allowed me to assume
you were no longer

07:40.020 --> 07:41.681
permitted to practice medicine.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.119
I'm not. I let my
license expire.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.752
But that was your choice.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.519
I hadn't realized

07:46.560 --> 07:49.961
quite how traumatic it must
have been, losing your patient.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.161
It's no small thing,
walking away from a career

07:52.200 --> 07:53.838
requiring 12 years of training.

07:53.870 --> 07:56.566
It's pretty hard to be a
surgeon when you freeze up

07:56.610 --> 07:58.168
every time someone
hands you a scalpel.

07:58.210 --> 08:00.735
I just didn't trust
myself anymore.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.998
What can I do
for you folks?

08:03.050 --> 08:05.610
Help us return this
to its rightful owner.

08:05.650 --> 08:06.912
I give out my
number a lot.

08:06.950 --> 08:08.975
G_ot_to be in it to
Win it, you know?

08:09.020 --> 08:10.715
Speaking of which,
can I interest you

08:10.750 --> 08:12.752
in a complimentary chai?
No, thanks.

08:12.790 --> 08:14.155
The receipt indicates
she was here

08:14.190 --> 08:16.954
at 8:35 am,
wearing deep red lipstick.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.657
Oh, yeah, the blonde.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.622
Cleavage, tight
white skirt, heels.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.525
And her perfume.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.629
I mean, how often do
you meet a sew doctor?

08:25.670 --> 08:27.695
How do you know
she was a doctor?

08:27.740 --> 08:29.799
She was wearing a white
lab coat under her jacket.

08:31.340 --> 08:34.673
Ms. Cleavage is
not a doctor.

08:34.710 --> 08:36.234
Of course she wasn't.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.771
No doctor would wear her
lab coat out of the hospital.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.813
Nor would she wear revealing
attire or heavy perfume,

08:41.850 --> 08:43.317
which could trigger a
patient's asthma attack

08:43.350 --> 08:44.988
or chemical sensitivity.

08:45.020 --> 08:48.956
The lab coat is a bit
confounding, though.

08:48.990 --> 08:51.959
Actually,
I don't think it is.

08:53.730 --> 08:55.789
This chain only has
two stores in New York City,

08:55.830 --> 08:56.819
so we have a 50/50 shot

08:56.870 --> 09:00.590
of finding our
blonde here.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.737
Try one in one.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.099
I can't believe Trent's dead.

09:08.140 --> 09:10.938
How exactly did
you know Mister...?

09:10.980 --> 09:12.868
Kelty, Trent Kelty.
We were neighbors.

09:12.920 --> 09:16.117
A few months ago, he told me
he was having trouble seeing.

09:16.150 --> 09:17.879
He just thought
he needed new glasses.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.182
Then they found the tumor.

09:19.220 --> 09:21.586
After he lost his
eyesight completely,

09:21.620 --> 09:23.224
I started visiting more.

09:23.260 --> 09:25.251
I used to read him the
sports section from the Post.

09:25.290 --> 09:26.848
You two were close.

09:26.900 --> 09:27.958
Honestly,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.297
Ijust felt bad for him.

09:29.330 --> 09:30.797
Seemed like the right thing

09:30.830 --> 09:32.229
to do, you know?

09:32.270 --> 09:34.830
What time did you leave
the hospital this morning?

09:34.870 --> 09:37.100
Oh, a little after 9:30. Why?

09:37.140 --> 09:39.199
Because we have reason to
believe Mr. Kelty succumbed

09:39.240 --> 09:41.071
to something other
than natural causes.

09:41.110 --> 09:43.146
You think he was murdered?

09:43.180 --> 09:45.045
Oh, quite certain,
I'm afraid.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.877
Did anyone see you
leave the hospital?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.376
Someone from
the nurses' station?

09:48.420 --> 09:50.684
I don't know.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.244
Um, I can give you
my Metro card.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.258
That'll tell you
what time I caught my train

09:54.290 --> 09:55.279
after I left.
Hmm.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.725
I place Trent Kelty's
death around 10:30.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.296
If she left at 9:30...

10:00.330 --> 10:02.821
Too early for the epi
to have been administered.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.189
She couldn't be the killer.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.133
Thank you.

10:07.170 --> 10:09.138
Can you think of
anyone who would've

10:09.170 --> 10:10.762
wished to harm
Mr. Kelty?

10:10.810 --> 10:13.301
Family member, romantic
partner, business partner.

10:13.340 --> 10:14.898
One of the reasons
I made a point

10:14.940 --> 10:16.669
to visit Trent
was he was so alone.

10:16.710 --> 10:18.849
No family, hardly any friends.

10:18.880 --> 10:22.839
The only other person he used
to talk to was this doctor

10:22.890 --> 10:24.243
that used to
come by at night.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.917
His doctor visited him at night?

10:25.950 --> 10:26.951
Not his oncologist.

10:26.990 --> 10:30.118
Just a doctor
at the hospital.

10:30.160 --> 10:33.323
They used to talk about his
cancer, how to manage the pain.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.658
It seemed like he was
helping Trent cope

10:35.700 --> 10:37.099
with what was coming.

10:37.130 --> 10:38.688
His cancer was terminal?

10:38.730 --> 10:40.698
He only had
a few months to live.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.833
You didn't know?

10:42.870 --> 10:44.132
You didn't happen to cut up

10:44.170 --> 10:45.865
his food for him this morning,
did you?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.433
Oh, the pancake?

10:48.480 --> 10:50.744
No, it was like that
when I got there.

10:50.780 --> 10:51.804
Why?

10:51.850 --> 10:53.340
(grunts)

10:53.380 --> 10:55.348
(passing horn honks)

10:55.380 --> 10:58.349
Whoever cut up
Trent Kelty's breakfast

10:58.390 --> 11:00.381
came back after Jacqueline
left, killed him.

11:00.420 --> 11:03.127
We may have a much bigger
problem on our hands

11:03.160 --> 11:05.185
than this morning's homicide.

11:05.230 --> 11:07.790
Because of
the pancakes?

11:07.830 --> 11:09.821
You know I dislike
proposing a theory

11:09.870 --> 11:12.122
in its formative stages
before I feel confident

11:12.170 --> 11:13.831
of its conclusions.

11:13.870 --> 11:16.430
Tell me.

11:16.470 --> 11:18.802
We know that
Trent Kelty's killer

11:18.840 --> 11:20.876
had some degree
of medical expertise.

11:20.910 --> 11:23.140
We also know that
Trent was visited

11:23.180 --> 11:26.377
almost exclusively by a man
claiming to be a doctor,

11:26.410 --> 11:28.810
a man who I believe
cut an adult's food

11:28.850 --> 11:30.818
into child-size bites.

11:30.850 --> 11:33.250
Now, why would
a killer do that?

11:33.290 --> 11:35.485
_It reflects_
a particular... mindset.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.125
That of an individual
who tended to Trent's needs

11:38.160 --> 11:41.323
not out of empathy
but out of a craving
for his dependence.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.260
And that mindset,
in turn, reflects

11:43.300 --> 11:44.927
a particular kind of killer:

11:44.970 --> 11:46.961
one who chooses victims
who are Sick and weak,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.230
one whose victims, he believes,
are doomed to die.

11:49.270 --> 11:52.933
A man who would be
drawn to someone with
a few months to live.

11:52.980 --> 11:56.802
Someone whose
preferred hunting ground
is a hospital. Why?

11:56.850 --> 11:59.410
Because it provides
an endless supply of victims.

11:59.450 --> 12:01.771
You're talking
about an Angel of Death.

12:01.820 --> 12:05.085
If I'm right, Angels are
prolific, relentless.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.782
Even if Trent Kelty
was our Angel's first kill,

12:07.820 --> 12:09.048
it won't be his last.

12:16.060 --> 12:18.028
Angel of Death here?
I don't know,

12:18.070 --> 12:19.765
we've got some pretty
top-notch people on board.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.267
I think they would
have sniffed it out.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.507
It is just a theory,
for the moment,

12:23.540 --> 12:25.758
but I've been right
about everything so far.

12:25.810 --> 12:28.404
The autopsy showed
that Trent Kelty's
epinephrine level

12:28.440 --> 12:31.238
was well in excess of what
he received during the code.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.009
He was murdered.

12:33.050 --> 12:35.439
I'm very sorry to hear that.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.414
If I'm going
to prove

12:37.450 --> 12:39.543
that someone is
killing patients here,
I need information,

12:39.590 --> 12:42.058
access _to all medical records
of in-hospital deaths

12:42.090 --> 12:43.387
and all logs relating
to the supply

12:43.430 --> 12:44.522
and usage of epinephrine.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.879
Why are you
talking to me?

12:45.930 --> 12:48.023
Sanchez handles all the records.

12:48.060 --> 12:50.290
I'm not talking to him, because
I know that he'll say no.

12:50.330 --> 12:52.059
I came to see you,
because you smiled

12:52.100 --> 12:53.897
when I made fun of his height
this morning.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.066
You don't like him.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.102
I don't blame you.
You're also the head

12:57.140 --> 12:59.438
of a very important department,
so your opinion carries

12:59.470 --> 13:02.234
a lot of weight
around here.
Okay,

13:02.280 --> 13:04.077
I'll talk to him.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.044
And by "talk,"
I mean I will threaten

13:06.080 --> 13:08.913
to hold a press conference
to express my grave concerns

13:08.950 --> 13:10.508
regarding this hospital's
apparent indifference

13:10.550 --> 13:12.882
to the possibility
that a murderer

13:12.920 --> 13:15.059
may be stalking
its halls.

13:15.090 --> 13:17.888
You should have everything
you need in a couple of hours.

13:21.860 --> 13:24.567
(sighs)
All this 'cause you made
a couple of short jokes.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.067
Any luck?

13:26.100 --> 13:27.897
Luck is an offensive,
abhorrent concept.

13:27.940 --> 13:30.909
The idea that there is
a force in the universe

13:30.940 --> 13:32.032
tilting events
in your favor

13:32.070 --> 13:32.559
or against it is ridiculous.

13:32.610 --> 13:34.134
Idiots rely on luck.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.932
So that'd be a "no."

13:35.980 --> 13:37.345
Fill me in.

13:37.380 --> 13:38.574
Maybe I can help.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.612
12 years of training,
remember?

13:40.650 --> 13:43.187
We're in my wheelhouse.

13:43.220 --> 13:45.438
Over the past two years
at Chandler Memorial,

13:45.490 --> 13:50.154
73 seriously ill patients
have died of cardiac events.

13:50.190 --> 13:52.124
Well, chances are
some of those are natural.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.492
I mean, sick people do
have heart attacks and die.

13:54.530 --> 13:56.521
Which means that one,
none, or some of them

13:56.560 --> 13:59.324
may have fallen victim to the
same person who killed Kelty.

13:59.370 --> 14:01.497
But without the Angel's victims,
I can't see his pattern,

14:01.540 --> 14:04.429
and without his pattern, I can't
develop a list of suspects.

14:04.470 --> 14:05.607
Okay, so forget
potential victims.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.198
Let's focus
on the murder weapon.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.878
Epinephrine is hard
to get ahold of.

14:08.910 --> 14:10.446
Even if our killer
had a prescription

14:10.480 --> 14:12.209
because of an allergy,
he would have

14:12.250 --> 14:13.547
a very limited amount.
It's more likely...

14:13.580 --> 14:15.411
That he nicked it
from the hospital pharmacy.

14:15.450 --> 14:17.042
I already checked the records.
The pharmacy reported

14:17.090 --> 14:18.944
epinephrine missing
on only two occasions,

14:18.990 --> 14:22.482
neither of which
corresponds to any of
the 73 cardiac events.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.385
Okay, then, the crash carts.

14:24.430 --> 14:27.058
It's stocked with epi,
and they're usually unlocked.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.328
I think the logs

14:28.360 --> 14:30.419
are over here.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.892
Okay, during 2011,

14:31.930 --> 14:34.160
epi went missing from
various crash carts

14:34.200 --> 14:36.259
on January 6...

14:36.300 --> 14:37.335
March 19...

14:37.370 --> 14:38.439
March 27...

14:38.470 --> 14:40.574
June 20...
October 28.

14:40.610 --> 14:42.601
That's a fair amount
of a drug to go missmg

14:42.640 --> 14:44.449
without anyone
raising an alarm, no?
You know,

14:44.480 --> 14:46.141
hospitals are more
worried about oxy

14:46.180 --> 14:48.171
and other opiates being
sold on the street.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.619
Epi doesn't qualify.

14:49.650 --> 14:51.413
You ready for 2012?

14:51.450 --> 14:52.439
'Kay, February 17...

14:52.490 --> 14:53.582
April 4...

14:53.620 --> 14:56.111
May 25...

14:56.160 --> 14:57.479
September 19.

14:58.390 --> 14:59.994
Each of the dates you mentioned

15:00.030 --> 15:02.521
corresponds with one
of the 73 cardiac deaths.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.996
If you're right, he's
killed nine people.

15:06.030 --> 15:09.193
We have our pattern;
now we'll find our suspects.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.037
(siren wailing in distance)

15:11.070 --> 15:12.503
WATSON :
23 suspects

15:12.540 --> 15:14.428
is a lot--
how long do you think

15:14.480 --> 15:16.607
it's gonna take you
and Detective Bell
to interview them?

15:16.640 --> 15:18.574
Far less time than it would
have taken to interview

15:18.610 --> 15:21.943
the roughly 2,000 male doctors
and nurses I started with.

15:21.980 --> 15:23.447
I cross-referenced
time cards to identify

15:23.490 --> 15:25.685
men who were working on
the days of the murders,

15:25.720 --> 15:28.052
then eliminated those who
did not have ready access

15:28.090 --> 15:29.489
to floors where
the deaths occurred.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.454
You said nurses--
Kelty told his neighbor

15:31.490 --> 15:33.594
that the man who visited
him was a doctor.

15:33.630 --> 15:35.598
Kelty was blind from
his tumor, remember?

15:35.630 --> 15:38.224
For all he knew, his visitor
could've been a circus clown.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.090
You go get started--
I'm gonna meet Carrie

15:40.140 --> 15:41.562
for a coffee,
see if she can point us

15:41.600 --> 15:43.261
in the direction
of any hospital oddballs.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.981
About yesterday, I got
a bit carried away.

15:59.020 --> 16:01.011
Apologies.

16:02.460 --> 16:03.688
It's all right.

16:03.730 --> 16:04.651
(bell dings)

16:21.210 --> 16:23.405
Shouldn't you be in
the conference room

16:23.450 --> 16:25.668
starting your interrogations?

16:25.710 --> 16:27.712
Well, I thought I'd start here.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.513
With me? You serious?

16:29.550 --> 16:31.518
I got you access to those files.

16:31.550 --> 16:34.053
Calculated risk.
Perfect way to deflect suspicion

16:34.090 --> 16:36.479
in the event
I eventually got access.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.329
(chuckling):
Okay.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.692
If you say so.
By now,

16:40.730 --> 16:42.652
I'm sure you've realized
three of the nine patients

16:42.700 --> 16:45.521
I believe fell victim
to the Angel were yours.

16:45.570 --> 16:46.696
Coincidence?

16:46.730 --> 16:49.164
Uh, actually... no.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.701
Not at all.

16:50.740 --> 16:53.436
According to you, the Angel
kills severely ill patients.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.698
I operate on
the sickest people we got.

16:55.740 --> 16:58.504
Still, your practice shares
a certain casual attitude

16:58.550 --> 17:00.347
towards life and death.

17:00.380 --> 17:03.315
Your mortality rates
go up each year.
That's because

17:03.350 --> 17:06.478
I take on patients
that no one else will _treat.
Last year the hospital

17:06.520 --> 17:08.488
forced you to stop performing
an experimental procedure

17:08.520 --> 17:10.329
when you racked up a 75%

17:10.360 --> 17:13.124
failure rate.
_There are _risks _
assoaated With innovation.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.491
Lawsuits among them.

17:14.530 --> 17:15.792
Among your failures

17:15.830 --> 17:17.798
were two fatalities,
each of which

17:17.830 --> 17:19.627
cost the hospital
several million dollars

17:19.670 --> 17:21.092
when the families sued.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.368
It's my understanding

17:22.400 --> 17:23.799
you've been on
unofficial probation

17:23.840 --> 17:25.501
since then--
one more mistake,

17:25.540 --> 17:27.098
you're gone
from Chandler Memorial,

17:27.140 --> 17:29.108
complete with a recommendation
to the State Board

17:29.140 --> 17:30.368
to suspend your license.

17:30.410 --> 17:31.638
Now, maybe you started
killing patients

17:31.680 --> 17:33.648
to punish the hospital
for losing faith in you.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.513
Or perhaps you just wanted
to feel like God again.
Okay,

17:36.550 --> 17:38.188
do you really want
to know why I'm not

17:38.220 --> 17:39.312
the killer
that you're looking for?

17:40.720 --> 17:42.483
This Angel, if he exists,

17:42.520 --> 17:44.329
kills people who are pain.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.328
It's a mission of mercy.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.827
Me, I'm a surgeon.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.499
My favorite kind of patient
is unconscious on a table

17:50.530 --> 17:51.758
with a tube down his throat.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.360
These people,
to be honest,

17:54.400 --> 17:55.799
I'm not really interested

17:55.840 --> 17:57.535
in whether they're
suffering or not.

17:57.570 --> 17:59.208
It doesn't... really affect me,

17:59.240 --> 18:01.777
and that's what makes me
exceptional at what I do.

18:01.810 --> 18:03.641
So you're too indifferent
to your patients

18:03.680 --> 18:05.102
to be the Angel of Death.

18:06.450 --> 18:07.644
Novel alibi.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.318
Well, there's
also the fact

18:09.350 --> 18:12.285
that, uh, at the time
Mr. Kelty was killed...

18:12.320 --> 18:13.787
yesterday...

18:13.820 --> 18:16.755
I was on a train from
my home in White Plains.

18:16.790 --> 18:19.884
But I got to get back
to work, and, uh...

18:19.930 --> 18:22.455
it seems like you do, too.

18:24.930 --> 18:26.795
Your friend who works
with the police,

18:26.830 --> 18:28.263
he's sure there's
an Angel here?

18:28.300 --> 18:30.268
Well, "sure" is a strong word,

18:30.310 --> 18:32.870
but the pattern is
pretty hard to deny.

18:32.910 --> 18:34.730
Oh, crap, I got to run.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.248
I have this
pre-op consult.
Okay.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.770
You know, why don't
you come with me?

18:38.810 --> 18:40.175
I'll keep trying to
think of weirdos.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.619
No, thanks, that's fine.
Yeah, come on.

18:41.650 --> 18:43.311
It'll only take
a few minutes.

18:45.650 --> 18:47.311
(knocking, door opens)

18:47.360 --> 18:48.509
Hi, Morgan.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.425
This is my old friend,
Joan Watson.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.921
Morgan's here 'cause
she tore her ACL.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.757
Let me guess.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.620
Soccer player,
right wing?

18:57.670 --> 18:59.319
Center, actually.

18:59.370 --> 19:00.837
Heart of the offense-- nice.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.533
Okay, can you flex
your knee for me?

19:06.940 --> 19:09.829
MORGAN:
Are you a doctor, too?

19:09.880 --> 19:12.542
No. Not anymore.

19:12.580 --> 19:14.719
How come?

19:14.750 --> 19:18.538
I'm just gonna take
a listen to your heart.

19:18.590 --> 19:22.686
MAN:
I'm afraid I'm
a little confused, Detective.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.722
'Cause most of the people
you're asking me about

19:24.760 --> 19:26.421
weren't even my patients.

19:26.460 --> 19:28.724
Well, all nine of them
died of cardiac events

19:28.760 --> 19:30.591
while you were
on shift.
Oh, wow.

19:30.630 --> 19:33.269
Nine sick people
died in a hospital.
You assisted

19:33.300 --> 19:34.858
in_ several_of
their operations.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.266
(sighs)
Yes, I'm a surgical resident--

19:37.310 --> 19:39.904
_ I am involved
in lots of surgeries.

19:39.940 --> 19:43.569
Look, I have been on call
for the last 29 hours,

19:43.610 --> 19:45.578
haven't slept, barely eaten,

19:45.610 --> 19:48.875
and still have an hour
drive home, so... (sighs)

19:48.920 --> 19:51.912
is there anything else
I can help you with?
Yeah, this guy here,

19:51.950 --> 19:53.918
James Romano,

19:53.960 --> 19:55.450
had pancreatic cancer.

19:55.490 --> 19:57.458
One of the worst
forms there is.

19:57.490 --> 19:59.219
I know, 'cause...

19:59.260 --> 20:01.251
that's what killed
my grandmother.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.467
Sometimes I wish...

20:05.500 --> 20:07.639
I wish there
had been someone there

20:07.670 --> 20:11.401
with the strength
to, uh... end

20:11.440 --> 20:13.431
her pain.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.644
You think someone
killed this man?

20:18.680 --> 20:20.648
Th-The other patients, too?

20:20.680 --> 20:23.740
He does. That's why he's trying
to gain your confidence,

20:23.790 --> 20:25.610
suggest to you that
he's on your side,

20:25.650 --> 20:28.255
that he actually empathizes
with someone

20:28.290 --> 20:30.827
who would take a life
for the right reasons.

20:30.860 --> 20:33.499
Only he's wasting his time;
you're free to go.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.298
(door opens, closes)

20:38.330 --> 20:40.434
You want to tell me
why you did that?

20:40.470 --> 20:42.358
Because it's highly unlikely
that he's our Angel.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.665
That guy was so
nervous, he was about
to come out of his skin.

20:45.710 --> 20:46.802
You saw how
he was tapping

20:46.840 --> 20:48.307
his keychain.
I also saw

20:48.340 --> 20:49.807
how he stopped tapping
when he realized

20:49.840 --> 20:51.546
the only reason
he was called in here

20:51.580 --> 20:52.979
was because
of the patient deaths.

20:53.010 --> 20:54.841
Suddenly he relaxed
and the tapping stopped.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.472
Which means...

20:56.520 --> 20:58.511
even if he is a creep,

20:58.550 --> 21:00.552
he's probably
not our killer.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.717
And given the number of suspects
we have left to question...

21:02.760 --> 21:04.557
I'll bring in the
next interview.

21:06.060 --> 21:07.755
Thanks for your help in there.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.051
She's been pretty scared.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.022
Sure.

21:11.070 --> 21:14.836
Hey, sorry if this is weird, but
I noticed something in there.

21:16.970 --> 21:18.528
Yeah, she's a
soccer player.

21:18.570 --> 21:19.935
She probably just
jammed her toe--

21:19.970 --> 21:22.803
happens all the time.
Or it could be
endocarditis.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.444
(laughs) Joanie, come on.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.038
She's a healthy 12-year-old girl

21:26.080 --> 21:28.810
with a bum knee,
not an I.V. drug user

21:28.850 --> 21:32.286
or someone with
a congenital heart defect.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.315
I just checked her heart.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.555
I heard no murmur and no rub.

21:37.590 --> 21:39.820
If she has endocarditis,

21:39.860 --> 21:41.919
she could crash
during her surgery.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.565
Please, just to be safe,
run an echocardiogram.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.921
And she says
she's done with medicine.

21:47.970 --> 21:49.631
Fine.

21:49.670 --> 21:52.537
I'll order an echo,
just to be safe.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.107
You and Bell really moved
through those interviews.

21:57.140 --> 21:58.903
That's what happens

21:58.950 --> 22:01.441
when you fail to turn
up a single solid lead.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.016
No one jumped out at you?

22:03.050 --> 22:04.540
Uh-uh. What about
yourfnend?

22:04.590 --> 22:07.047
Any oddballs
come to mind?

22:07.090 --> 22:09.752
I was right
earlier, wasn't I?

22:09.790 --> 22:11.781
You two were close,
but not anymore.

22:13.430 --> 22:15.022
After my patient died,

22:15.060 --> 22:17.767
I lost touch with a lot
of my hospital friends.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.028
Being around them
was difficult.

22:19.070 --> 22:20.731
(phone buzzes)

22:20.770 --> 22:23.409
Carrie just didn't get it.
Speak of the devil.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.032
Bad news?

22:25.070 --> 22:26.560
Uh, good, actually.

22:26.610 --> 22:28.407
I met one of Carrie's
patients today.

22:28.440 --> 22:29.907
I thought she might
have endocarditis.

22:29.940 --> 22:31.669
I asked her
to run a test.

22:31.710 --> 22:32.904
Turns out I was wrong.

22:32.950 --> 22:35.077
You're disappointed.
Of course I'm not.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.418
No, you didn't want
the patient to be sick,

22:37.450 --> 22:38.883
but you wanted
to be right.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.080
Are you sure
you weren't?

22:40.120 --> 22:41.849
Am I sure
I wasn't what?
Right.

22:41.890 --> 22:43.084
This test she performed--

22:43.120 --> 22:45.020
is it the gold standard
for endocarditis?

22:45.060 --> 22:46.925
Is it completely
conclusive?
No, but most cases...

22:46.960 --> 22:48.450
Forget most cases.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.468
What was your first instinct
when you saw the patient?

22:50.500 --> 22:53.060
That she had endocarditis.
Then hold the course.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.738
Myriad studies have shown

22:54.770 --> 22:57.739
that first instincts
are typically the right ones.

22:57.770 --> 23:00.432
What?

23:00.480 --> 23:01.936
What is it?
That car.

23:01.980 --> 23:05.438
I think it belongs to one
of my suspects, Dr. Cahill.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.778
The bobcat sticker
on the bumper--

23:07.820 --> 23:09.117
it matches
the one on his car key,

23:09.150 --> 23:11.516
and his car key said
his car was a Nissan.

23:11.550 --> 23:13.142
Okay, so that's his car.
What about it?

23:13.190 --> 23:15.454
Well, Bell thought
that he was a solid suspect

23:15.490 --> 23:16.809
for the Angel. I disagreed.

23:16.860 --> 23:18.179
Thing is, as of
five hours ago,

23:18.230 --> 23:19.857
Dr. Cahill wrapped up
a 30-hour shift.

23:19.890 --> 23:21.721
Said he was going
to go home and sleep.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.022
Legally, he's not allowed
to set foot

23:23.060 --> 23:24.869
in the hospital
for another six hours.

23:24.900 --> 23:26.162
When I got off call,

23:26.200 --> 23:27.997
I couldn't get out
of the hospital fast enough.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.565
So what's his car still
doing in the parking lot?

23:44.150 --> 23:46.710
(rhythmic whooshing)

23:50.690 --> 23:52.157
Dr. Cahill,
we meet again.

23:52.190 --> 23:54.499
What-what the hell is this?

23:54.530 --> 23:56.225
Hey, what-what do you think
you're doing?

23:56.260 --> 23:58.490
Hey, get off of me!
I work here!

23:58.530 --> 24:00.498
You're not gonna take
his word over mine.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.998
Sherlock, I don't think
he's the Angel.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.099
There's no epinephrine
in that syringe.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.505
It's empty.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.178
That's a PCA machine.

24:09.210 --> 24:10.643
It dispenses morphine.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.477
That's what
he was in here for.

24:12.510 --> 24:14.842
He was trying to steal it.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.019
So, we didn't
catch the Angel.

24:17.050 --> 24:19.610
We caught an addict.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.152
Stupid.

24:25.190 --> 24:28.159
Registered his bloodshot eyes
and general twitchiness.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.088
Chalked them up
to sleep deprivation.

24:30.130 --> 24:32.064
I should probably have known
what he really was.

24:32.100 --> 24:34.694
He was a doctor using
morphine on the job

24:34.740 --> 24:36.139
and endangering
patients.

24:36.170 --> 24:37.535
You caught him.
That's important.

24:37.570 --> 24:39.208
W-Why are you taking
all those down?

24:39.240 --> 24:40.832
'Cause they're
no longer suspects.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.201
Your point regarding Dr. Cahill
would be quite heartening

24:43.240 --> 24:45.845
if his drug habit
had anything to do

24:45.880 --> 24:47.973
with the murderer currently
stalking the hospital.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.271
A murderer who is most likely

24:49.320 --> 24:51.083
targeting his next victim
as we speak.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.712
A murderer I am no closer

24:52.750 --> 24:54.286
to identifying
than I was this morning.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.185
You met 23 people
in one day.

24:56.220 --> 24:57.983
Maybe you missed
something.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.954
I spent today soaking in
every word, every gesture,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.096
every involuntary reaction
of these 23 former suspects.

25:05.130 --> 25:08.566
Dr. Cahill was the only blip
on the radar.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.966
Maybe not the
only blip.

25:12.740 --> 25:15.072
All of the Angel's victims
were terminal...

25:15.110 --> 25:17.977
except one-- her.

25:18.010 --> 25:20.274
Samantha Cropsey. She was
the second to last victim.

25:20.310 --> 25:23.814
She was quite sick, she'd been
in the ICU for two weeks.

25:23.850 --> 25:25.715
Yes, but look here
in her chart: CABG.

25:25.750 --> 25:28.958
That's Coronary Artery
Bypass Graft.

25:28.990 --> 25:30.981
She'd had major surgery,
she was recovering slowly,

25:31.030 --> 25:33.282
but she was recovering.
She wasn't going to die.

25:33.330 --> 25:36.128
So, why did the Angel
make an exception for her?

25:36.160 --> 25:39.095
(phone ringing)

25:39.130 --> 25:41.132
Captain?

25:41.170 --> 25:43.968
GREGSON:
That druggie doctor we scooped
up at the hospital tonight?

25:44.010 --> 25:45.807
He's talking. A lot.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.102
Turns out he might be able

25:47.140 --> 25:49.279
to help us find the Angel
after all.

25:49.310 --> 25:52.143
By the time I get out
of surgery, I'm wiped out

25:52.180 --> 25:54.273
and keyed up,
all at the same time.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.276
I can't sleep
without the morphine.

25:56.320 --> 25:59.016
No, it's not like the patients
that you're stealing it from

25:59.050 --> 26:00.859
need it to deal with
their excruqating pain.

26:00.890 --> 26:03.017
I'm telling you this
because I want to help.

26:03.060 --> 26:04.322
So help.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.225
Tell him what you told me.

26:06.260 --> 26:10.196
(sighs)
A couple months ago,
I snuck into a patient's room.

26:10.230 --> 26:12.994
Older guy,
end stage liver cancer.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.839
I knew he'd have morphine.

26:14.870 --> 26:16.189
Raymond Sutter, Angel victim

26:16.240 --> 26:18.333
number seven.
Once I got

26:18.370 --> 26:20.167
the morphine out of the PCA,

26:20.210 --> 26:22.872
I ducked into the bathroom to...

26:22.910 --> 26:23.899
I believe the words
you're looking for

26:23.950 --> 26:25.201
are "shoot" and "up."

26:25.250 --> 26:28.742
And, uh, when I got myself
together to leave,

26:28.780 --> 26:32.181
I realized someone was
coming into the room.

26:32.220 --> 26:34.188
Did you see
his face?

26:34.220 --> 26:36.085
I hid out in the bathroom
the whole time.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.759
They talked
for, like, an hour.

26:38.790 --> 26:40.951
Uh, I didn't recognize
the guy's voice,

26:41.000 --> 26:44.390
but he was definitely a doctor,
talked a lot about medicine.

26:44.430 --> 26:47.297
Were they discussing
Sutter's condition?

26:47.330 --> 26:48.934
Yeah, yeah. The doctor explained

26:48.970 --> 26:51.234
how the cancer _
was shutting down his liver,

26:51.270 --> 26:54.774
how the, uh... the toxins would
slowly build up in his body.

26:54.810 --> 26:57.131
Really, you know,
laid it all out for the guy.

26:57.180 --> 27:00.946
I could tell it wasn't
the first time talking about it.

27:00.980 --> 27:03.141
The doctor knew that
the patient didn't have much

27:03.180 --> 27:04.647
in the way of family.

27:04.690 --> 27:08.182
And the next day...
died of a heart attack.

27:08.220 --> 27:09.983
I didn't think
anything of it.

27:10.020 --> 27:12.329
Except that you'd need to find
a new source for your morphine.

27:12.360 --> 27:16.251
CAHILL:
And when you and the detective
asked about an Angel of Death,

27:16.300 --> 27:19.224
it got me wondering.

27:19.270 --> 27:21.738
Didn't know how to tell you
what I'd heard

27:21.770 --> 27:26.798
without explaining why I was
in that patient's bathroom.

27:26.840 --> 27:29.229
Nothing like getting caught
to help one grow a conscience.

27:33.250 --> 27:36.242
We're back on
track, Watson.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.282
Dr. Cahill described a doctor
with an approach identical

27:38.320 --> 27:40.185
to the one described
by the neighbor

27:40.220 --> 27:41.915
who'd been visiting
Trent Kelty.

27:41.960 --> 27:45.157
He talks to his victims, gets to
know them before he kills them.

27:45.190 --> 27:46.748
Finally, our theoretical
Angel is proved real.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.326
Where are you going?

27:48.360 --> 27:50.191
To take another look at
the hospital records.

27:50.230 --> 27:52.323
Dr. Cahill's insights may
cast them in a new light.

27:52.370 --> 27:54.065
You have copies
of the records at home.

27:54.100 --> 27:55.294
I prefer to work
on the originals.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.932
There's more detail,
more texture.

27:56.970 --> 27:58.733
I was right about
the Angel, Watson.

27:58.770 --> 28:00.067
As a wise man once said,

28:00.110 --> 28:03.102
"First instinct,
usually the right one."

28:03.140 --> 28:05.142
(siren blaring)

28:05.180 --> 28:06.841
Joanie, hey.

28:06.880 --> 28:09.474
I think you should run a T.E.E.
on Morgan before her surgery.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.283
Her echo was clean,
as I expected.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.015
She doesn't have
endocarditis.

28:13.050 --> 28:15.280
25% of cases don't show up
on the standard echo.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.379
In addition to her splinter
hemorrhage, she's pale.

28:17.420 --> 28:19.183
I'm not subjecting
a 12-year-old

28:19.230 --> 28:21.790
to a scary and invasive test
because you have a hunch.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.764
Okay, I know
I'm overstepping...
Yes, you are.

28:23.800 --> 28:27.167
Morgan is my
patient, not yours.
Okay, I understand.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.792
Ijust... My gut is telling me

28:28.840 --> 28:30.933
that if you operate
on her, she could die.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.938
She'll be fine, Joan.

28:32.970 --> 28:36.474
I'm operating
on her, not you.

28:42.380 --> 28:45.315
Expected you an hour ago.

28:45.350 --> 28:48.717
I went to the hospital to talk
to Carrie about her patient.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.386
Victory?

28:52.430 --> 28:55.194
I did what I could.

28:55.230 --> 28:57.221
Well, on the bright side,

28:57.260 --> 29:02.197
_I've made a rather
important discovery.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.367
Dariya Ruseckas' consent form.

29:04.410 --> 29:08.369
Uh, she's the
fifth victim.
Look closely.

29:08.410 --> 29:10.037
It's a standard consent form
for an angiogram With contrast.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.399
This is the
appropriate procedure.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.803
Note the handwriting,

29:12.850 --> 29:14.909
or rather, the handwritings.

29:16.250 --> 29:18.946
Oh, they're two different kinds.

29:18.990 --> 29:20.810
Dariya printed her name
and signed it,

29:20.860 --> 29:22.509
but someone else filled out
the body of the form.
Exactly.

29:22.560 --> 29:25.779
The nurse who initialed
the form here.

29:25.830 --> 29:27.422
A.J. It stands
for Anichka Jones.

29:27.460 --> 29:29.451
Jones, I'm assuming,
is a married name,

29:29.500 --> 29:31.365
because "Anichka" is
as Ukrainian as it gets.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.233
Explains why she filled out
the form for Ms. Ruseckas.

29:34.270 --> 29:36.397
Because Ms. Ruseckas,
born in Ukraine,

29:36.440 --> 29:38.965
obviously did not speak enough
English to fill it out herself.

29:39.010 --> 29:40.432
Okay.

29:40.470 --> 29:42.472
The killer liked to converse
with his victims,

29:42.510 --> 29:44.478
repeatedly and at great length.

29:44.510 --> 29:46.944
Getting to know them was clearly
part of the process.

29:46.980 --> 29:51.087
And he could have only gotten to
know her if he spoke Ukrainian.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.439
We just need to check
the personnel records

29:52.490 --> 29:54.117
for a doctor who knows it.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.958
I already did.
There are none.

29:56.990 --> 29:59.322
Then why are you so happy?

29:59.360 --> 30:01.555
Because, Ms. Watson,
as you very well know,

30:01.600 --> 30:04.467
not all doctors stay doctors.

30:04.500 --> 30:08.197
_ _Your lack of accent
is qUIte impresswe, Mr. Gura.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.468
Thank you.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.003
I learned English as a boy.

30:12.040 --> 30:13.871
Hmm. IfI met you on the street,

30:13.910 --> 30:16.037
I would never guess
you were a native Ukrainian.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.878
But at work, well, the tools
of your trade gave you away.

30:18.910 --> 30:21.515
Your janitor's cart--
you decorated the handle

30:21.550 --> 30:23.882
with, uh, blue and yellow rags.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.842
Since all of your cleaning rags
were white,

30:25.890 --> 30:28.313
I knew that the fabric
was deliberately chosen,

30:28.360 --> 30:29.952
and as I later realized,

30:29.990 --> 30:32.322
representative of the colors
of the Ukrainian flag.

30:32.360 --> 30:35.523
Then I pulled your personnel
file, and lo and behold,

30:35.560 --> 30:38.120
under education,
you listed Olesky University.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.991
Congratulations. Arguably,

30:41.040 --> 30:42.996
best medical school
in all of Ukraine.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.860
Not arguably.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.366
Hmm.

30:46.410 --> 30:48.605
Yes, I was a doctor in Ukraine.

30:48.640 --> 30:51.200
Now I'm a janitor.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.377
Is that why I'm here?

30:53.410 --> 30:55.514
A problem
with how I clean the floors?

30:55.550 --> 30:59.008
Actually, we thought
maybe you could help us.

30:59.050 --> 31:01.553
HOLMES;
Do you recognize any
of these people?

31:01.590 --> 31:04.457
They were all patients
at the hospital.

31:04.490 --> 31:06.458
"Were" being the operative word.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.629
They're all dead now.

31:10.100 --> 31:12.091
We believe they were all...

31:12.130 --> 31:14.496
murdered.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.566
Yes, I remember them.

31:19.610 --> 31:22.238
Many of these patients
were very sick.

31:22.280 --> 31:23.599
Even dying.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.471
That makes it okay to kill them?

31:25.510 --> 31:28.638
When a patient is in pain,
dying is not a tragedy.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.477
It is a release.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.613
You make it sound so noble.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.449
The murder of defenseless,
sick people. (chuckles)

31:37.490 --> 31:39.583
I'm sorry.
I still don't understand

31:39.630 --> 31:41.450
why you want to speak with me.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.252
GREGSON:
We got a warrant, Mr. Gura.

31:43.300 --> 31:44.619
We searched your
apartment this morning

31:44.670 --> 31:46.661
while you were
at the hospital,

31:46.700 --> 31:49.339
and we found... this.

31:49.370 --> 31:51.304
HOLMES:
It's a log

31:51.340 --> 31:54.377
filled with medical notes,
written by you.

31:54.410 --> 31:57.379
Exclusively
about these nine patients.

31:57.410 --> 32:01.676
And we know that you're the man
who killed them.

32:07.620 --> 32:10.214
I freed them.

32:10.260 --> 32:13.024
I freed them
from the pain-wracked prison

32:13.060 --> 32:14.721
their bodies had become.

32:14.760 --> 32:18.093
I saw them,

32:18.130 --> 32:21.099
I studied them.

32:21.140 --> 32:25.463
Confirmed for myself there was
no chance at recovering,

32:25.510 --> 32:28.104
that all they had to live for

32:28.140 --> 32:30.404
was the horror of dying.

32:30.440 --> 32:33.568
And I did what
needed to be done.

32:33.610 --> 32:36.579
I showed them mercy.

32:36.620 --> 32:39.680
What about Samantha Cropsey?

32:39.720 --> 32:42.416
What about her?
HOLMES:
She was getting better.

32:42.460 --> 32:45.657
How can you call
what you did to her mercy?

32:45.690 --> 32:47.624
Better?

32:47.660 --> 32:51.721
People do not get better from
metastasized cardiac cancer.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.328
She didn't have cancer.

32:53.370 --> 32:54.667
She was recovering
from bypass surgery.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.292
Her-her blood pressure
was improving,

32:56.340 --> 32:57.534
her oxygen saturation...

32:57.570 --> 32:59.504
No. You're wrong.

32:59.540 --> 33:01.599
They'd found a mass
in her heart.
What happened?

33:01.640 --> 33:03.779
Did you get bored of waiting
for somebody sick enough?

33:03.810 --> 33:06.677
The pain was so bad,
she could hardly form sentences.

33:06.710 --> 33:08.678
She was begging me
to make it stop.
She had her entire life

33:08.720 --> 33:09.516
ahead of her!
No!

33:09.550 --> 33:11.586
She was dying.

33:13.090 --> 33:14.557
You're no better
than the police

33:14.590 --> 33:17.150
in Soviet Ukraine,

33:17.190 --> 33:20.557
making up
lies to suit your truths.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.659
I am done talking.

33:24.700 --> 33:27.123
You've said
qUIte enough.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.431
Holmes.

33:39.310 --> 33:41.278
Great work.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.174
We'll take it
from here.

33:43.220 --> 33:44.744
What, what is it?

33:44.790 --> 33:47.748
He's telling the truth o-or
at least he thinks he is.

33:47.790 --> 33:49.257
About being the Angel?

33:49.290 --> 33:51.087
About Samantha
Cropsey's condition.

33:51.130 --> 33:52.358
He's convinced
she was suffering

33:52.390 --> 33:54.096
from terminal
cardiac cancer.

33:54.130 --> 33:55.427
Well, he's also convinced

33:55.460 --> 33:57.428
that he helped those people
that he killed.

33:57.460 --> 33:58.597
He's a lunatic.

33:58.630 --> 34:01.394
What'd you expect?

34:01.440 --> 34:04.466
I don't know,
just not this.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.609
I was thinking
sushi tonight.

34:18.650 --> 34:21.153
Salmonella,
Vibrio parahaemolyticus,

34:21.190 --> 34:22.657
mercury poisoning,
Anisakis simplex:

34:22.690 --> 34:24.749
all illnesses contractible
from eating raw fish.

34:24.790 --> 34:26.655
Anisakis, of particular note,

34:26.690 --> 34:28.499
is a worm that can burrow
into the wall of the intestine,

34:28.530 --> 34:29.622
often requiring
surgery

34:29.660 --> 34:31.799
to remove it,
but, yeah, sushi's good.

34:31.830 --> 34:33.525
(sighs)
Why are you still

34:33.570 --> 34:35.367
looking through those files?
You caught the Angel.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.492
I caught someone
who is

34:36.540 --> 34:38.337
smart, medically knowledgeable,

34:38.370 --> 34:40.702
and fiercely attentive
to detail.

34:40.740 --> 34:42.230
His notes _ _
on Samantha Cropsey's condition

34:42.280 --> 34:43.508
say that cardiac cancer

34:43.540 --> 34:46.179
was discovered
during her bypass surgery.

34:46.210 --> 34:47.677
Why did he get it so wrong,

34:47.710 --> 34:51.544
and why is he so convinced
he was right?

34:51.590 --> 34:52.716
(doorbell rings)

34:52.750 --> 34:54.809
You expecting
someone?

34:54.860 --> 34:57.078
Am I ever?

35:01.260 --> 35:03.228
Mr. Holmes, right?

35:03.260 --> 35:04.693
We met the other day.

35:04.730 --> 35:06.721
Joanie's friend.

35:10.300 --> 35:12.768
I got your information
from Bruce in the morgue.

35:12.810 --> 35:15.802
He seemed to think I might
be able to find her here.

35:15.840 --> 35:18.104
Watson, it's for you!

35:20.880 --> 35:22.609
Carrie.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.783
I wanted you to know
you were right.

35:29.820 --> 35:31.526
Morgan had
endocarditis.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.824
The lab found it
when they ran a T.E.E.,

35:33.860 --> 35:35.157
which, coincidentally,
is the test

35:35.200 --> 35:37.156
you wanted me
to run on her.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.168
The funny thing is,
I didn't order it.

35:39.200 --> 35:41.464
Some anonymous person

35:41.500 --> 35:44.663
put the request in her chart
and the lab followed through.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.608
Remember, on our
vascular rotation,

35:48.640 --> 35:51.200
how the chief resident
always used to say,

35:51.250 --> 35:53.707
"Better luclq
than good"?

35:53.750 --> 35:55.809
Sounds to me like
you were lucky.

35:55.850 --> 35:59.547
Yeah, I guess I was.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.411
I know what it's like
not to be lucky.

36:04.760 --> 36:07.923
It turned my life
upside-down.

36:07.960 --> 36:11.521
You were always
a good friend, Joanie,

36:11.570 --> 36:13.765
but you were
a better doctor.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.770
Aren't you full
of surprises?

36:26.810 --> 36:28.710
Of course you were listening.

36:28.750 --> 36:31.389
Altering the girl's
chart, saving her life.

36:31.420 --> 36:33.911
Apparently your instincts
were spot on.

36:33.950 --> 36:34.917
Well done.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.281
Thank you.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.788
Actually it's me who
should be thanking you.

36:39.830 --> 36:41.821
You've given me an idea
as to why Danilo Gura

36:41.860 --> 36:43.396
would have killed
Samantha Cropsey.

36:43.430 --> 36:44.727
Get your coat.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.795
I need to speak
with Danilo right away.

36:46.830 --> 36:49.594
I think he may have been
holding out on us.

36:52.670 --> 36:54.809
Dr. Baldwin,

36:54.840 --> 36:58.674
you are a brilliant man,
are you not?

36:58.710 --> 37:00.769
You didn't tell me
he was going to be here.

37:00.810 --> 37:02.846
I asked you
a question.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.848
Are you a, a
brilliant man?

37:04.890 --> 37:06.687
(chuckles)

37:06.720 --> 37:08.551
You're a step ahead of everybody
for long enough,

37:08.590 --> 37:10.012
people start calling you
brilliant.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.483
I get a feeling that you know
something about that.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.498
Ah, indeed I do.

37:14.530 --> 37:16.327
One of the dangers of
brilliance, however,

37:16.360 --> 37:17.896
is that you sometimes
fail to recognize

37:17.930 --> 37:19.591
the possibility
that others are--

37:19.630 --> 37:23.862
at least in some respect--
just as brilliant.

37:23.900 --> 37:26.937
Last night, for example,
it occurred to me,

37:26.970 --> 37:28.608
I may not have been
the first person

37:28.640 --> 37:30.835
to discover the Angel of
Death at Chandler Memorial.

37:30.880 --> 37:33.974
I'm sorry, you're saying
that someone else knew

37:34.010 --> 37:36.740
that he was there
but kept it to themself?

37:36.780 --> 37:38.680
A brilliant someone,

37:38.720 --> 37:42.417
in this case a brilliant someone
With extenswe medical knowledge

37:42.460 --> 37:44.428
and real reason_
to pay close attention

37:44.460 --> 37:46.849
to the sudden death
of two of his surgical patients.

37:46.890 --> 37:48.858
Okay, if you're referring to me,

37:48.900 --> 37:52.597
I can assure you I had no idea
what Danilo Gura was up to.

37:52.630 --> 37:54.598
We checked the
morgue security logs.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.892
Apparently you went there
to examine the two bodies

37:56.940 --> 37:58.760
of _the first two
patients you lost

37:58.810 --> 37:59.765
to the Angel.

37:59.810 --> 38:01.903
They were my patients.

38:01.940 --> 38:04.477
I wanted to know What happened.

38:04.510 --> 38:05.977
I didn't find out
anything unusual.

38:06.010 --> 38:09.377
I believe that you did realize
they had been murdered.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.342
Perhaps you noticed
a bit of ischemia,

38:11.390 --> 38:14.518
as brilliant men
are wont to do,

38:14.560 --> 38:15.982
but around the same time

38:16.020 --> 38:18.989
you committed
yet another surgical error.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.021
You left a clamp
in Samantha Cropsey's chest

38:21.060 --> 38:23.654
during a routine bypass surgery.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.668
Okay, I've had
just about enough of this.

38:25.700 --> 38:26.997
Whoa.
It was inevitable

38:27.030 --> 38:28.998
Samantha would develop
complications.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.463
The mistake could have been
easily rectified,

38:31.510 --> 38:33.831
the clamp removed,
but not without earning you

38:33.870 --> 38:37.977
your third strike and ending
your formerly great career...

38:38.010 --> 38:40.740
unless the Angel
could make it all go away.

38:40.780 --> 38:43.669
You realized that
he targeted patients

38:43.720 --> 38:47.884
who were not only terminal
but also in tremendous pain,

38:47.920 --> 38:51.048
so you set about making Samantha
an attractive target.

38:51.090 --> 38:53.684
First you found
the biopsy of a patient

38:53.730 --> 38:55.129
dying of cardiac cancer.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.856
You put Samantha's name
on the biopsy results,

38:57.900 --> 38:59.891
you noted that the tumor
was found during her surgery,

38:59.930 --> 39:01.898
and then you placed them
into her chart.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.090
Secondly you made sure
that she was in pain

39:04.140 --> 39:06.938
so the Angel would feel
compelled to end her suffering.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.506
That was
simple enough.

39:08.540 --> 39:10.906
Just _reduce
her pain meds.

39:10.940 --> 39:13.602
Now, this had the added benefit
of making her too delirious

39:13.650 --> 39:15.641
to effectively communicate
with a killer who liked

39:15.680 --> 39:16.977
to chat up his victims.

39:17.020 --> 39:19.488
The Angel took the bait.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.818
Samantha _succumbed
to a cardiac event.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.487
Now, all you had
to do was remove

39:23.520 --> 39:25.488
those cancer results
from her chart

39:25.530 --> 39:28.988
and your mistake was erased
until today.

39:29.030 --> 39:30.952
GREGSON:
We received
permission to exhume

39:31.000 --> 39:33.423
Ms. Cropsey's body.

39:33.470 --> 39:38.169
The M.E. found this lodged
in her ribcage.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.009
It's a surgical clamp.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.905
Look familiar?

39:43.040 --> 39:45.543
Let's say that I believe you.

39:45.580 --> 39:49.141
Let's say
that you actually found that

39:49.180 --> 39:50.943
in Samantha's remains.

39:50.980 --> 39:53.517
A|| you've proven is
that I made a mistake--

39:53.550 --> 39:55.950
a mistake that'll probably end
my career

39:55.990 --> 39:57.685
and keep me from helping
thousands of people--

39:57.720 --> 40:01.121
but I see no evidence at all
that I faked records

40:01.160 --> 40:02.525
or that I killed
people.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.118
Excellent points,

40:04.160 --> 40:07.960
which is Why I visited
Danilo Gura late last night.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.004
His patient logs were
so detailed, so comprehensive,

40:12.040 --> 40:14.133
first I suspected
he must have copied the data

40:14.170 --> 40:15.899
directly from the charts.

40:15.940 --> 40:18.977
But why would he risk doing that
in a hospital

40:19.010 --> 40:21.046
where someone could walk in
at any moment?

40:21.080 --> 40:23.139
Then it hit me:

40:23.180 --> 40:25.580
he'd taken pictures.

40:27.590 --> 40:29.615
Like this one for example.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.528
At first

40:33.560 --> 40:37.052
he refused to acknowledge
the photos' existence,

40:37.100 --> 40:38.920
but after I explained how
you had manipulated him

40:38.970 --> 40:40.995
into violating
his code,

40:41.030 --> 40:42.930
he told us we could find them
on a flash drive

40:42.970 --> 40:45.165
he had hidden
in a vent near his apartment.

40:45.210 --> 40:47.064
God forbid either of you
should ever need surgery

40:47.110 --> 40:48.998
to save your life.

40:49.040 --> 40:52.009
I am the guy you want
standing over you in the OR.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.574
I imagine it was
that kind of thinking

40:53.610 --> 40:55.749
that helped you justify
Samantha's murder.

40:55.780 --> 40:59.546
Her life versus the thousands
you believed you'd save.

40:59.590 --> 41:01.046
GREGSON:
I was talking to the DA.

41:01.090 --> 41:02.114
this morning.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.253
He figures
murder two is a lock.

41:04.290 --> 41:06.588
You're looking
at 20 to life.

41:06.630 --> 41:09.497
NEWS ANCHOR:
Chandler Memorial Hospital

41:09.530 --> 41:12.658
was rocked by scandal
for the second time in two days

41:12.700 --> 41:15.237
when Dr. Mason Baldwin was
arrested for his role

41:15.270 --> 41:17.158
in the death of one

41:17.200 --> 41:19.703
of confessed Angel of Death
Danilo Gura's victims.

41:19.740 --> 41:20.707
Recent...

41:20.740 --> 41:22.105
(DVR chirps)

41:22.140 --> 41:26.144
My favorite bit--
this moment.

41:27.580 --> 41:30.879
The slumped shoulders,
the pallor,

41:30.920 --> 41:33.912
like a turtle trying to
retreat back into its shell.

41:34.990 --> 41:37.151
I'm happy for you.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.950
I'm also exhausted,
I'm turning in.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.956
I must say, Watson,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.992
I enjoyed catching a glimpse
of you in your former element.

41:47.030 --> 41:49.999
Seems to me_
your friend was right.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.008
You were quite a doctor.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.201
I had my moments.

41:54.240 --> 41:56.538
* You_could never be
a face in the crowd... *

41:56.580 --> 41:59.174
Maybe you'll give it another go
one of these days.

41:59.210 --> 42:02.145
* So you're travelin' on

42:02.180 --> 42:05.616
* Travelin' on out

42:07.620 --> 42:09.087
* Well, you know

42:09.120 --> 42:12.578
* I'll never say it out loud

42:12.630 --> 42:17.522
* I'll be travelin' on,
travelin' with you *

42:19.800 --> 42:23.930
* Hey, I'm too weak

42:23.970 --> 42:27.235
* It's too much to fight off

42:27.270 --> 42:31.274
* The past so strong

42:32.310 --> 42:34.915
* But now

42:34.950 --> 42:37.145
* I don't think
too much of the time *

42:37.180 --> 42:39.239
* I'll just try to keep up...
