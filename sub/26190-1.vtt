WEBVTT

01:11.052 --> 01:12.311
Ah. Ooh.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.126
Oh, bollocks.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.797
We've got a problem.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.467
A cyber attack?
Yes, prime minister.

01:39.558 --> 01:42.470
Took me two bottles of wine

01:42.561 --> 01:45.394
and half a packet of sleeping
pills to finally nod off.

01:45.522 --> 01:50.016
And you wake me because some fat-fingered
hacker's pinched your pin number?

01:50.319 --> 01:51.921
Well, it's a little more serious
than that, prime minister.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.856
Hmm?
The identities of every one

01:53.947 --> 01:55.938
of our serving agents
have been exposed.

01:56.950 --> 01:57.985
What?

01:58.118 --> 02:00.109
Who's doing this?
We're not sure, ma'am.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.032
So one week before I host
my first g12 summit,

02:03.123 --> 02:05.330
britain's entire security
apparatus has been taken down

02:05.459 --> 02:06.824
and you know absolutely nothing?

02:06.918 --> 02:09.660
That does pretty much sums up
the situation, ma'am, yes.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.733
Well, you better get someone on
it and find me some answers!

02:11.757 --> 02:14.027
Yes, but that's the problem.
We don't have any agents left.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.086
They've all been outed.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.585
So bring back an old one!

02:31.401 --> 02:35.485
All units, this is Juliet echo.
Stand by for target coordinates.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.984
Target acquired.
Repeat, target acquired.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.800
Now then, what have we here?

03:05.102 --> 03:06.217
Sorry, sir.

03:06.395 --> 03:07.976
Never mind, baggaley.

03:08.063 --> 03:11.100
Your concealment and camouflage
work is definitely improving.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.313
Thank you, sir.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.526
Come on.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.521
You, too, ibadulla.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.817
Excellent. That is
a first-class man-trap.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.364
Six house points.
Yes!

03:23.120 --> 03:25.327
Right, let's get back
to school before matron

03:25.414 --> 03:26.654
notices you're missing.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.410
And don't worry, there aren't
any more booby traps.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.586
Apart from this one, of course.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.810
Mr. English?

03:51.106 --> 03:52.596
We haven't seen him, sir.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.181
Huh.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.235
And that's camouflage.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.151
Hmm.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.496
And go.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.662
And go.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.865
And go.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.997
The welfare of your children
is our Paramount concern.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.370
They're never exposed
to any unnecessary risk,

04:17.466 --> 04:18.875
I assure you.

04:29.770 --> 04:33.888
I think that's an "f" for your bomb
disposal coursework, hattersley.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.019
"You're looking particularly
beautiful tonight."

04:37.152 --> 04:40.565
You're looking particularly
beautiful tonight.

04:40.864 --> 04:41.864
"Ching!"

04:42.199 --> 04:43.439
Ching!

04:45.535 --> 04:48.072
Have a good half-term, sir!
Thank you.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.290
Are you seriously telling me
this is all we've got?

05:43.426 --> 05:44.757
Most of them are either dead,

05:44.845 --> 05:47.678
having hip operations or
recovering from prostate surgery.

05:49.766 --> 05:50.766
Okay.

05:51.393 --> 05:55.136
Before your briefing, we'll need you
to re-sign the official secrets act.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.432
Thank you.

05:56.815 --> 05:57.850
Thank you.

05:57.941 --> 05:58.941
Thank you.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.932
Thank you very much.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.602
Any of you gentlemen
remember this?

06:04.072 --> 06:07.610
Ooh, the mont blanc blaster. Haven't
seen one of those for years.

06:07.868 --> 06:12.532
Take the cap off and, if memory serves,
you've 20 seconds to replace it

06:12.664 --> 06:15.497
or it detonates with the force
of a stun grenade.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.310
Thank you.

06:39.983 --> 06:42.349
Teas on the left, gentlemen.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.441
And coffees on the right.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.944
Excellent.

06:46.072 --> 06:49.030
Oh, damn it, I forgot my pills.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.316
Here, have some of mine.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.995
Scotch whisky, single malt?

06:55.123 --> 06:56.954
Thank you very much.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.158
Coffee.
Oh.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.493
Here, let me help you with that.

07:06.801 --> 07:07.881
Tea?

07:13.350 --> 07:16.137
Ooh, this one just needs
a little top-up of hot water.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.226
I'll be right back.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.347
Man's a divot
of the first order.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.774
Someone should put him
out of his misery.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.940
Along with whoever
furnished this room.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.197
Ohl

07:37.499 --> 07:39.490
ah, good morning.
Sorry to keep you.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.201
Are the others here?

07:43.505 --> 07:44.745
Um...

07:45.840 --> 07:47.000
Oh.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.717
They, um... they nodded off.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.266
Right...

07:57.519 --> 07:58.804
And who are you exactly?

07:59.312 --> 08:00.392
English.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.062
- Johnny English.
- Well...

08:04.526 --> 08:06.016
"English..."

08:07.362 --> 08:08.818
You'll leave immediately.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.987
My people will give you
the full briefing en route.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.405
Oh, is there anything you need?

08:12.492 --> 08:16.201
Yes, nerve gas nasal spray,
a type-four exoskeleton...

08:16.329 --> 08:18.240
You should probably
start a list.

08:18.373 --> 08:21.786
And a garroting watch, with a rubber
strap, not the steel bracelet

08:21.918 --> 08:25.251
because the links get caught in
the little hairs on my wrist.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.670
Oh, and I'll also need a bough.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.706
What's a bough?

08:31.094 --> 08:32.094
Sir!

08:34.179 --> 08:36.010
Wonderful to see you!

08:37.225 --> 08:39.932
Yes, all right, bough. We're going
on a mission, not a honeymoon.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.767
Yes, of course, sir.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.434
Ah. I think it's the pin of your
buckle, sir. It's caught on my jumper.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.877
Yes, I can see
what's wrong, bough.

08:46.901 --> 08:50.064
If you go to your left
and I'll go to my right.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.690
I'm sorry, no, if you go to your
right and I'll go to my left.

08:56.745 --> 09:00.283
No. If I go clockwise
and you go anti-clockwise...

09:01.249 --> 09:02.810
Er, no, I think that's
making it worse, sir.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.246
Hmm. I'm surprised
that didn't work.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.671
Good morning, sir. I have your
agent activation pack here.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.881
Department-issue smartphone.

09:15.972 --> 09:20.261
580-megapixel camera,
4.7-inch retina hd display.

09:20.351 --> 09:25.345
Hmm-hmm. Ingenious. And what
does it shoot? Poison darts?

09:25.982 --> 09:29.691
It doesn't shoot anything.
It's a phone.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.189
There's a Twitter handle,
instagram feed

09:32.280 --> 09:34.271
and secure login for the
department uber account.

09:34.365 --> 09:35.405
What's he on about, bough?

09:35.450 --> 09:37.566
I need a weapon.
Not a box of gobbledygook.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.118
I think, uh, what agent English

09:40.205 --> 09:42.491
is getting at, sir, is all
this is highly trackable.

09:42.791 --> 09:46.158
But since we're dealing with a very
sophisticated, digital target,

09:46.252 --> 09:50.837
we might be less visible if we took
a more analog, low-tech approach.

09:52.509 --> 09:53.589
Exactly.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.342
I see.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.674
Is there anything else
I can get you?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.430
A gun.

10:01.976 --> 10:06.140
We don't really do guns anymore.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.104
Just get him a gun.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.810
Right, a gun.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.532
Right. Haven't actually done
one of these before.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.819
"It is my obligation
under section 14

10:22.914 --> 10:24.767
"of the health and safety
directive to inform you

10:24.791 --> 10:27.453
"that the equipment with which
you are about to be issued

10:27.544 --> 10:29.455
‘can cause injury
and bodily harm.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.999
"Furthermore, any agents
with nut allergies

10:36.094 --> 10:37.279
"should be aware
that traces of cashew oil..."

10:37.303 --> 10:38.634
Thank you.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.676
Right, transport.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.515
So, take any hybrid you want.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.654
I'll take this one.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.952
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
English. This car is a relic.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.830
Drinks petrol, leaks oll
and has no passive,

11:11.921 --> 11:13.582
let alone
active safety features.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.276
Do you know what else
it doesn't have, sir?

11:15.300 --> 11:18.042
Satellite navigation
or a single computer chip.

11:18.136 --> 11:21.378
Making it completely invisible
to a digital enemy.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.473
The equipment
agent English requested, sir.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.766
Thank you.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.682
Phone, bough?
Yeah.

11:32.859 --> 11:36.067
That hi-tech villain of yours
will never see us coming.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.419
Let's see what they've given us.

11:56.132 --> 12:00.842
Exoskeleton, exploding cotton
buds, the old shoebox inflatable.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.135
Hmm.

12:03.097 --> 12:07.466
Ooh, what are these? Instant
release super high energy pills.

12:07.685 --> 12:11.803
Like sticking your fingers in an
electric socket. Highly recommended.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.849
Right, so, the red ones must be the
total knockout sleeping pills.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.065
Correct.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.439
Hmm. Probably worth
labeling these.

12:19.530 --> 12:20.565
Oh.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.069
Look, sir. Sweeties.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.157
Ooh.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.443
Hang on a minute.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.411
I always did love a jelly baby.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.582
I wouldn't if I was you, bough.
"Jelly" is short for gelignite.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.438
One bite and it'll take
the top of your head off

12:34.462 --> 12:36.123
along with the roof of the car.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.454
So, what does this do?

12:39.717 --> 12:41.582
It's a mixtape, bough.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.677
- So, destination?
- South of France, sir.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.759
That cyber attack
seems to have been launched

12:50.853 --> 12:53.310
from the Wi-Fi signal
of a hotel in antibes.

13:38.067 --> 13:41.355
Sir? Sir, I've just had
a fax through from hq.

13:41.779 --> 13:44.896
Background checks on all the guests
that accessed the Wi-Fi network.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.107
You see? Who needs email?

13:52.874 --> 13:54.114
Um...

13:54.208 --> 13:56.540
One name has raised
a red flag, sir.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.249
Sebastian lynch, ex-army
and military intelligence.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.339
Now selling his services
to the highest bidder.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.296
Where do we find him?
Directly ahead, sir.

14:07.972 --> 14:11.180
He's got an 8:00 reservation
at the cote de roc restaurant.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.986
The problem's going to be getting close
enough for a full surveillance, sir.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.150
Not necessarily.

14:43.966 --> 14:47.049
Oh, darling, I've just gotta
get this. Two seconds.

14:47.637 --> 14:51.971
Simple plan, two parts. You provide
the distraction, I'll get the phone.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.390
Yes, sir.
And from now on,

14:54.769 --> 14:59.729
perhaps we should sound
like French waiters.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.266
French waiters?

15:04.153 --> 15:05.393
Yees.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.108
Go on.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.907
Are you finished now, Sebastian?

15:17.208 --> 15:18.698
Bread roll?

15:18.960 --> 15:20.040
Yes, thank you.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.376
Excellent choice, madame.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.250
Good evening.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.423
How are you?

15:29.220 --> 15:30.710
Bread roll, sir?

15:30.847 --> 15:32.257
Yes. Thank you.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.555
One second.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.766
Excuse me, would you mind?

15:41.607 --> 15:43.814
Oh, yes. Evening.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.482
Evening.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.165
Thank you.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.593
Where's my phone?

16:18.269 --> 16:19.634
That is your phone.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.562
Ooh.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.237
Thank you.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.566
Monsieur.

16:32.742 --> 16:36.030
The, uh, shell on my wife's lobster,
could you remove it, please?

16:38.247 --> 16:39.407
Yees.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.119
Uh... um...

16:42.376 --> 16:43.536
Hmm.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.834
Let me crack it for you.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.020
Ow!
Oh!

17:05.816 --> 17:06.976
Owl

17:38.432 --> 17:39.592
hello?

17:42.687 --> 17:44.973
Steve, I'll have to call you back.
Call you back.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.473
Give me a sec. Hang on.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.438
What is going on?

17:54.949 --> 17:56.985
Sebastian, don't get involved.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.660
Ah.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.333
What is he doing? I don't know.
He's a fool.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.003
There we are.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.465
Voila.

18:21.851 --> 18:24.092
Hmm. Bon appétit.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.348
I will talk to the manager.
I will talk to the manager.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.617
Textbook, bough.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.914
Just holiday snaps, sir.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.039
Wait a minute, this photo.

18:51.297 --> 18:55.131
It was taken the same day our villain
accessed the Wi-Fi, and look.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.920
Whoever was on that yacht

19:01.015 --> 19:03.757
could easily have used
the hotel's Wi-Fi,

19:03.851 --> 19:07.014
sent that signal
and then just sailed away.

19:07.563 --> 19:12.227
I think it's time
we paid the dot calm a visit.

19:24.955 --> 19:25.955
Algorithms.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.247
We are surrounded by them.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.495
Algorithms run our lives,

19:30.586 --> 19:35.046
choose our TV shows, stream our music.
Even find us a date.

19:37.093 --> 19:38.833
I know this chap, don't I?

19:38.969 --> 19:42.211
Yes, he's that silicon valley
billionaire who dated a Kardashian.

19:42.306 --> 19:45.013
Two Kardashians and a black-eyed pea.
Keep watching.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.426
But supposing there was an
algorithm for an entire country.

19:48.521 --> 19:52.105
A single algorithm that could be
applied to every one of its problems.

19:52.358 --> 19:56.522
A single algorithm that could take
a second-rate nation and make it

19:57.071 --> 19:58.936
world class.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.694
Every nation is awash with data.

20:03.411 --> 20:08.030
So now, more than ever, we need to put
that data to work for the people.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.408
These few lines of code will
deliver the kind of change

20:11.544 --> 20:14.286
they have been dreaming of
their entire lives.

20:14.422 --> 20:17.459
I am Xander. I love data.

20:20.678 --> 20:22.418
He's so clever.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.467
He's young, he's sexy,
he's insanely successful.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.557
Just the qualities we need
people to associate with me.

20:29.895 --> 20:30.930
Yes, prime minister.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.554
And they will do when he
starts working with us.

20:33.691 --> 20:36.273
But why would a silicon valley
billionaire work with us?

20:36.402 --> 20:39.109
Just get him into number 10
and let me work on him.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.606
Yes, ma'am.
Go on.

20:43.534 --> 20:44.774
Oh, god, now what?

20:45.327 --> 20:46.888
There's been another attack,
prime minister.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.243
Oh!
Air traffic control.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.781
Someone's rerouted every
flight in Europe to luton.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.104
For god's sake, tell me the
agent you've got in the field

20:54.128 --> 20:55.834
is making some progress?

21:05.306 --> 21:08.298
So, how are we gonna find the
location of that yacht, sir?

21:08.434 --> 21:11.767
Very easily, bough.
We ring mi7.

21:16.025 --> 21:19.358
Hello, hello? Yes, I need the
location of a boat called...

21:23.657 --> 21:26.820
Hello? Hello, yes.
A boat called the dot calm.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.697
Yes, it's a play
on words. Yeah.

21:30.039 --> 21:31.039
Where?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.711
Looks about
half a mile out, sir.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.999
Do we wanna try
and swim it or...

21:43.135 --> 21:46.548
No, bough. This is a job for
the shoebox inflatable.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.295
No, don't open it
in the car, sir!

21:54.814 --> 21:57.806
Can you reach your door handle?

22:00.236 --> 22:01.817
No, sir.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.653
I'll try my side.

22:22.049 --> 22:26.042
Right, bough, our aim is to get
on board without anyone noticing.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.256
And how are we gonna do it?

22:28.472 --> 22:30.838
Magnetic boots.
Brilliant, sir.

22:31.725 --> 22:33.135
Simple mechanism.

22:33.269 --> 22:36.386
Left switch activates left boot.
Right switch activates right.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.937
Okay, let's go.

22:53.831 --> 22:59.326
Remember, the absolutely vital
element of this mission is surprise.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.878
Now, you have to get up
pretty early in the morning

23:22.902 --> 23:25.018
to outwit British intelligence.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.281
Quick!

23:39.460 --> 23:41.291
Good evening, gentlemen.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.579
Shall we start with your names?

23:45.716 --> 23:48.674
Clearly you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.010
That's why I'm starting
with your names.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.421
Actually, would you mind
coming down here?

23:54.558 --> 23:57.220
It's really hard to have
a conversation like this.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.265
I have a better idea.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.653
It's no good,
it won't move, sir.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.360
We'll see about that.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.825
Low-intensity
exploding cotton bud.

24:18.666 --> 24:21.203
That's quite a powerful charge
for such a small space, sir.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.703
Oh, nonsense.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.125
There will just be a slight pop.

24:35.140 --> 24:38.052
Shall we locate the hold and look
for the source of that signal?

24:38.143 --> 24:42.136
I think we should locate the hold and
look for the source of that signal!

24:45.484 --> 24:46.644
Come on!

24:58.539 --> 25:01.030
I'd say we have
our villain, bough!

25:01.166 --> 25:03.327
You need to keep
your voice down, sir.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.202
And we're not going to lose him.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.968
Hand me the sherbet fountain.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.473
Three sucks and the location
transmitter is activated.

25:27.568 --> 25:31.356
This gin palace will show up
as a hostile from 30,000 feet.

25:31.905 --> 25:32.940
Hmm.

25:39.830 --> 25:42.663
This is now an enemy target.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.749
Aniseed balls.

26:04.855 --> 26:08.097
If you'd wanted to kill me, you
would have already done so.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.359
Till we meet again.

26:21.497 --> 26:22.657
Owl

26:27.252 --> 26:29.538
well, that was sooner
than I expected.

26:33.383 --> 26:36.466
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.880
Who do you think she is, sir?

26:41.975 --> 26:44.637
Well, if she's not
the owner of that yacht,

26:44.728 --> 26:46.184
then she knows who is.

26:47.314 --> 26:49.805
Either way, she's the key
to this case.

26:52.152 --> 26:55.189
Is it true you were teaching,
sir? Before all this blew up?

26:56.490 --> 26:58.731
If by "teaching" you mean

26:58.867 --> 27:03.827
scouting for potential intelligence
operatives then yes, I was.

27:03.914 --> 27:04.994
Hmm.

27:05.082 --> 27:09.746
I actually got married, sir.
I don't know if you heard.

27:11.338 --> 27:12.338
No.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.337
Hmm.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.131
Yeah, Lydia.

27:16.218 --> 27:17.253
Lovely girl.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.676
You never think about getting
hitched yourself, sir?

27:24.935 --> 27:29.429
This is no life for a married man, bough.
The danger, the constant travel.

27:29.523 --> 27:30.603
Here you go, sir.

27:30.691 --> 27:32.682
More Lydia's life
than mine, sir.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.438
She's in the Navy, you see.

27:36.405 --> 27:37.565
What, as a cook?

27:38.407 --> 27:41.615
Or some kind of seagoing
secretary or...

27:41.702 --> 27:44.569
Oh, no, sir. She's the captain
of a nuclear submarine.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.245
Oh, right.
Hmm.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.410
Do you think we should get some
petrol for the Aston, sir?

27:53.881 --> 27:58.124
No. An Aston Martin is
surprisingly economical, bough.

28:00.179 --> 28:03.171
Besides, it looks like
we're in business.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.397
Come on.

28:25.621 --> 28:27.577
Looks like an electric car, sir.

28:27.664 --> 28:30.121
Yes, and sounds like
a nose hair trimmer.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.833
A bunch
of triple-a batteries

28:33.921 --> 28:36.537
is no match for old-fashioned
British horsepower.

28:58.070 --> 29:01.437
Look at her cornering. Seems so
effortless, doesn't it, sir?

29:42.489 --> 29:43.604
The what?

29:43.699 --> 29:45.940
The missile, bough, the one
with the tear gas warhead.

29:46.034 --> 29:48.571
But they're just cyclists, sir.
We'll get past in a minute.

29:48.662 --> 29:49.902
They're French cyclists, bough,

29:49.955 --> 29:52.662
and they're obstructing
her majesty's secret service.

30:00.507 --> 30:01.838
Wiper stalk is armed, sir.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.143
Sorry.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.888
Terribly sorry.
We do apologize.

30:15.022 --> 30:17.183
Stop it, bough,
you'll only encourage them.

30:32.706 --> 30:35.368
What are we gonna do now, sir?
Patience, bough.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.829
Driving like that, her battery
will be dead any moment.

30:38.962 --> 30:42.204
And she'll roll
to a humiliating stop.

31:01.485 --> 31:05.069
Bough, it is your job to keep
an eye on the fuel Gauge.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.907
Very impressive driving, Mr...

31:16.625 --> 31:17.705
Golightly.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.868
Basil golightly.

31:23.256 --> 31:25.872
And you're rather useful
yourself, miss...

31:26.551 --> 31:29.588
Bhuletova. Ophelia bhuletova.

31:29.763 --> 31:31.003
Hmm.

31:31.098 --> 31:32.838
And this is...

31:33.225 --> 31:34.225
Colin.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.013
I thought we were
using fake names.

31:38.939 --> 31:40.679
That is a fake name.

31:43.527 --> 31:44.858
Oh, right.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.728
Yes, this is Colin,

31:49.991 --> 31:51.106
and I'm...

31:55.288 --> 31:56.403
"Dasil."

31:56.873 --> 31:57.873
Dasil.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.291
Basil.

32:00.544 --> 32:02.751
Well, basil,

32:03.380 --> 32:05.060
maybe there is a simpler way
of doing this.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.167
Over a drink perhaps?

32:07.259 --> 32:09.625
Well, that would be lovely.

32:09.719 --> 32:14.383
Shall we say the bar at the hotel
de Paris in cagnes-sur-mer? 8:00?

32:14.474 --> 32:16.556
Mmm. It's a date.

32:21.940 --> 32:22.940
Well,

32:23.525 --> 32:27.689
I think my "running out of
fuel" ruse worked pretty well.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.319
Mmm.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.156
What?

32:34.327 --> 32:36.727
Er, junior doctors. They've
confirmed they are going on strike

32:36.788 --> 32:38.628
and the tube drivers
are coming out in support.

32:38.665 --> 32:41.561
Oh, god. Leader of the opposition, has
he come round from his heart surgery?

32:41.585 --> 32:42.620
Yes, prime minister.

32:42.711 --> 32:45.828
Oh, Jesus Christ, when will something
go right for me? What do you want?

32:46.631 --> 32:48.667
They've hit us again,
prime minister.

32:49.217 --> 32:51.708
Huh? Hacked into the central
traffic control system.

32:52.012 --> 32:55.425
Yes, they've turned every
traffic light in London to red.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.674
Where's my bloody drink?

33:00.437 --> 33:02.803
You've got to be joking?
Vodka tonic, no ice, no tonic.

33:02.898 --> 33:05.435
Yes, ma'am. Oh, and Mr. volta
has arrived, ma'am.

33:09.946 --> 33:12.562
Mr. volta,
welcome to downing street.

33:12.699 --> 33:15.782
I have read so much
about this wonderful building.

33:15.911 --> 33:19.403
Is this the stone triple staircase
designed by William Kent?

33:19.539 --> 33:22.702
Um, yes, it probably is.
I can't swear to it.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.371
- Can we do a quick...
- Needs Photoshop.

33:25.462 --> 33:27.953
Oh!
This way. Hmm.

33:28.089 --> 33:29.875
I am horribly late,
I do apologize.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.795
It's the traffic, it's the one
thing I don't love about London.

33:32.928 --> 33:35.340
Yes, well, I must admit
we are having a slight problem

33:35.430 --> 33:37.341
with the lights at the moment.
Nothing major.

33:37.474 --> 33:40.466
If you wanted, I could take a
look? It is kind of what I do.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.176
I think it's actually a little
bit more complex than...

33:43.313 --> 33:46.680
Xander, get a web address for
London's traffic control center.

33:47.359 --> 33:51.068
Here is the login page, Jason.
Do you have a password?

33:53.532 --> 33:54.692
Um...

33:57.827 --> 34:00.660
I won't tell if you won't.
Right you are.

34:01.957 --> 34:05.575
Bypassing security.
Security bypassed.

34:05.669 --> 34:06.669
Oh, that's terrific.

34:08.045 --> 34:11.208
Someone is hacking you.
Oh, I don't think so.

34:11.550 --> 34:15.384
Denied service attack.
Yeah, primitive but effective.

34:16.513 --> 34:19.880
You know what we could try,
rerouting all service requests

34:19.975 --> 34:22.091
to our server farm in Nevada.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.388
Um...
I.

34:25.647 --> 34:27.387
Rerouting, Jason.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.222
Rerouting complete.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.270
Crikey.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.900
So, what was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

34:40.245 --> 34:42.360
You, Jason.

34:43.540 --> 34:44.871
Get out.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.536
I want to talk about you.

35:01.016 --> 35:03.883
Excellent, bough.
Nearly there.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.225
Nearly there.

35:06.354 --> 35:09.346
This is actually
a really nice hotel, bough.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.975
I'm turning to the right.

35:25.999 --> 35:29.958
Shall one of us keep miss bhuletova busy
while the other searches her room, sir?

35:30.170 --> 35:34.163
Good idea, bough.
Alert me if you find anything.

35:56.321 --> 35:57.481
Mr. golightly.

36:00.492 --> 36:01.492
Oh...

36:02.160 --> 36:03.195
Indeed.

36:04.204 --> 36:07.287
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
On the contrary.

36:07.457 --> 36:10.073
Wild horses couldn't
keep me away.

36:10.835 --> 36:11.950
Madame? Monsieur?

36:12.504 --> 36:14.415
Evening. What would you like?

36:15.131 --> 36:18.749
I'm feeling a little homesick tonight.
I'll have a Moscow mule.

36:22.305 --> 36:24.637
And I'll have a London...

36:24.974 --> 36:26.965
Lemming, please.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.351
I'm not sure, what...

36:31.648 --> 36:34.981
It's, uh, gin, vodka,

36:36.444 --> 36:37.775
darmagnac,

36:38.530 --> 36:39.815
Sherry,

36:40.490 --> 36:42.981
with just a little bit
of parmesan.

36:49.165 --> 36:52.874
So, what brings you to the
south of France, miss...

36:52.961 --> 36:54.371
Bhilli... bholly...

36:54.462 --> 36:55.668
Bhuletova.

36:56.172 --> 36:57.537
Bhuletova.

36:57.882 --> 36:59.668
I'm just visiting
a friend of mine.

36:59.759 --> 37:00.874
Hmm.

37:03.930 --> 37:07.172
And would this friend
be the owner of the dot calm?

37:08.351 --> 37:09.431
Hmm.

37:09.519 --> 37:10.725
Yes, he would.

37:16.526 --> 37:18.357
And what about you,

37:18.445 --> 37:19.445
basil?

37:19.612 --> 37:21.944
Oh, I'm just here on business.

37:22.198 --> 37:25.190
Although, it's rapidly
turning into pleasure.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.029
Ooh! I love these.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.460
They're really hot.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.175
Are you all right?

37:48.600 --> 37:49.931
Yes, fine.

37:58.985 --> 38:00.020
Hmm.

38:06.493 --> 38:07.573
Cheers.

38:08.036 --> 38:11.199
I'm not sure I've ever met a
man quite like you, basil.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.539
Let me clear up
the uncertainty for you.

38:15.168 --> 38:16.533
You haven't.

38:30.767 --> 38:35.181
I'm sorry, basil. I have to get
up really early tomorrow morning.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.099
Oh, that's a shame.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.320
How did you get on, sir?

38:49.452 --> 38:52.114
Oh, gosh, what a wonderful
woman, bough. Wonderful.

38:52.247 --> 38:53.247
Right.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.238
Charming. Intelligent.

38:55.333 --> 38:59.042
Lovely sense of humor. And
obviously entirely innocent.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.287
Although, I broke into her room and
she does have three passports, sir.

39:02.382 --> 39:05.215
Romanian, Bulgarian, Russian.
Different name in each.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.210
So she's been married
to three different people.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.337
Not unusual in this day
and age, bough.

39:10.473 --> 39:13.340
And I also found some garroting
wire and two boxes of ammunition.

39:13.434 --> 39:18.269
Well, single woman, traveling
alone, you can't be too careful.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.398
You don't think
she might be a spy, sir?

39:22.861 --> 39:24.772
A spy?

39:25.530 --> 39:28.272
I think I know
what a spy looks like, bough.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.743
On.

42:29.088 --> 42:30.373
Ohl

42:59.118 --> 43:00.233
ah.

43:25.728 --> 43:26.728
Sir?

43:27.021 --> 43:28.021
Sir!

43:29.357 --> 43:31.348
I just got off the phone
to pin London.

43:31.442 --> 43:33.003
He's found out who the
owner of that yacht is.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.027
Jason volta.

43:34.112 --> 43:36.319
The world's most powerful
Internet billionaire, sir!

43:36.405 --> 43:37.770
And he's in London, right now.

43:37.865 --> 43:41.278
The prime minister is personally
negotiating a trade deal with him.

43:42.286 --> 43:43.867
Well, what are we waiting for?

44:15.111 --> 44:17.944
Do you think we might
slow down a little, sir?

44:18.739 --> 44:19.819
What?

44:21.993 --> 44:23.403
Never mind!

44:29.208 --> 44:31.449
With what appears to be
another cyber attack,

44:31.544 --> 44:32.938
pressure is mounting
oh the prime minister.

44:32.962 --> 44:34.918
Every train in england?
Yes, sir.

44:35.006 --> 44:38.089
They're all trying to terminate
at Bristol temple meads.

44:41.304 --> 44:42.339
Morning, sir!

44:42.430 --> 44:44.512
You see this, English?
Yes!

44:45.433 --> 44:46.433
Please.

44:47.226 --> 44:48.557
Ooh!

44:49.145 --> 44:51.602
Tell me you've got something I
can take to the prime minister.

44:51.689 --> 44:54.681
Would the name of the man
responsible do, sir?

44:55.026 --> 44:56.607
Excellent, English, yes.

44:57.236 --> 44:59.522
It's Jason...

45:09.707 --> 45:12.164
Volta, sir. Jason volta.

45:12.585 --> 45:13.585
What?

45:13.753 --> 45:16.335
You're accusing the pm's
knight in shining armor?

45:16.422 --> 45:18.253
I'd need hard evidence.

45:25.389 --> 45:26.720
Which...

45:27.475 --> 45:29.966
Is why agent English
is proposing

45:30.061 --> 45:32.598
a penetration of volta's
country estate in surrey.

45:32.813 --> 45:37.056
Yes, yes, yes, yes...

45:37.151 --> 45:39.483
Well, do what you have
to do, English.

45:39.862 --> 45:41.853
But for god's sake,
be discreet about it.

45:42.073 --> 45:44.109
Ohl! Oh.

45:44.200 --> 45:45.235
Good.

45:45.326 --> 45:46.406
Oh. Oh.

45:52.667 --> 45:54.373
"Virtual reality"?

45:54.502 --> 45:55.502
That's right, sir.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.946
P's built a computer model of
the inside of volta's mansion.

45:58.005 --> 46:02.965
When you put on this headset, it will look
and feel as if you are inside the house.

46:03.052 --> 46:06.510
You'll be able to open and close
doors, walk up and down staircases,

46:06.597 --> 46:09.384
completely familiarize
yourself with its layout.

46:09.475 --> 46:12.717
This floor moves in any
direction. So you can walk...

46:13.980 --> 46:17.393
You can walk as far as you
want in the virtual world

46:18.150 --> 46:20.607
without ever actually
leaving this room.

46:20.987 --> 46:22.022
One thing though, sir.

46:23.239 --> 46:24.945
The experience can be
very disorientating.

46:25.032 --> 46:26.238
It's completely immersive

46:26.325 --> 46:29.362
and some people lose all track
of their actual surroundings.

46:29.453 --> 46:32.661
I think we can pretty much
guarantee that's not gonna happen.

46:32.999 --> 46:35.331
I'll just need you to sign the
health and safety releases.

46:35.668 --> 46:38.375
Would you excuse me
while I find an iPad.

46:39.380 --> 46:42.668
Oh, go with him, bough. If we don't
chivvy him along we'll be here all day.

46:48.723 --> 46:49.963
Hmm.

47:10.161 --> 47:11.321
Ah.

47:33.392 --> 47:34.392
Watch out!

48:02.671 --> 48:04.457
Door closing.

48:05.091 --> 48:06.422
Going down.

49:07.153 --> 49:08.313
Hey!

49:23.794 --> 49:25.689
I'm sorry, sir, but you're
going to have to leave.

49:25.713 --> 49:26.748
Ow.

49:27.047 --> 49:28.082
Ow.

49:51.739 --> 49:54.856
So, we'll shortly be
arriving at admiralty house.

49:54.992 --> 49:58.905
And, er, that actually used to be
Oliver cromwell's own house. Um...

50:00.706 --> 50:02.037
Uh...

50:02.166 --> 50:05.658
And then we'll be going
to horse guards parade.

50:08.422 --> 50:10.208
Perhaps you'd like
to sit down, sir?

50:12.968 --> 50:14.833
Hey, whoa!

50:19.475 --> 50:20.885
I've got them!

50:25.564 --> 50:29.523
However, the agent we have on this mission
is confident he's making major progress.

50:29.610 --> 50:32.397
And, uh, yes, we have a potential
suspect, he's been identified.

50:32.905 --> 50:36.898
And further covert
investigations are now ongoing.

50:38.202 --> 50:39.408
Yes, quite.

50:39.662 --> 50:42.574
So I expect to have more
to announce on this front

50:44.333 --> 50:45.493
shortly.

50:59.390 --> 51:00.550
On.

51:01.433 --> 51:02.433
Sir?

51:02.518 --> 51:03.633
Mmm?

51:03.727 --> 51:06.560
Is everything all right, sir?
Yes, I've done it, bough.

51:06.814 --> 51:09.556
Child's play. Don't know what
all the fuss was about.

51:23.163 --> 51:25.154
Pleasure to see you again,
prime minister.

51:26.792 --> 51:29.704
It's a hologram. Apparently you
just speak to it normally.

51:31.380 --> 51:33.541
The pleasure's all mine.

51:33.632 --> 51:37.500
Hate to rush you, but was there
something in particular you needed?

51:37.595 --> 51:40.257
Actually, I was just calling
really to see

51:40.347 --> 51:44.386
if you had had a chance
to think things over.

51:44.643 --> 51:45.643
I have.

51:48.147 --> 51:51.731
But the thing is, Fiona, I just don't
really do other people's security.

51:51.817 --> 51:55.184
Not that I don't want to. But
your infrastructure is old.

51:55.529 --> 51:57.257
Plus the only way I could keep
you secure in the meantime

51:57.281 --> 52:00.819
would be by storing all your
data on my own servers.

52:00.909 --> 52:03.025
Obviously, that would be...
Yes. Jason,

52:03.120 --> 52:07.079
what I really want to do is announce
this tie-up at the g12 meeting.

52:07.958 --> 52:10.290
Do we have a deal?

52:19.470 --> 52:21.131
Good luck, sir.

52:39.823 --> 52:40.823
Hey.

52:40.991 --> 52:41.991
Sir?

52:42.076 --> 52:44.567
I said to get the chopper ready.
Right there.

52:44.662 --> 52:45.868
Sir. Right away, sir.

52:46.038 --> 52:47.244
Thank you.

52:47.456 --> 52:49.037
- Tyler, come in.
- Copy.

52:49.458 --> 52:51.414
Tyler, can you prepare
the chopper now?

52:51.543 --> 52:54.330
We'll have everything ready for
you in a couple of minutes.

53:25.661 --> 53:28.653
We can't keep meeting
like this, Mr. golightly.

53:28.747 --> 53:30.078
Oh, yes.

53:30.165 --> 53:33.123
Or do you want to end this charade
and tell me your real name?

53:33.419 --> 53:34.955
Go.

53:37.881 --> 53:41.749
There's so much you don't understand about
this world you've got caught up in.

53:42.845 --> 53:46.212
Spare me the idiot act.
You're British secret service.

53:47.433 --> 53:51.176
Impressive work in France, by the way.
When did you realize I was a spy, too?

53:52.688 --> 53:55.976
Oh, pretty much straight away.

53:56.859 --> 53:57.894
Hmm.

54:00.279 --> 54:04.272
I've spent two years undercover.
Simple operation until you showed up.

54:04.491 --> 54:06.231
And I like
to keep things simple.

54:07.119 --> 54:08.984
"Simple" is my middle name.

54:13.250 --> 54:15.115
It would seem you've got
a choice to make.

54:17.755 --> 54:21.668
Temporary suspension of hostilities?
A short-term partnership?

54:22.843 --> 54:24.003
Agreed.
Hmm.

54:30.642 --> 54:31.802
Hmm.

54:31.977 --> 54:34.935
Politicians are even more gullible
than venture capitalists.

54:35.022 --> 54:36.022
That is correct.

54:36.106 --> 54:37.386
Get me a copy
of the target list.

54:37.649 --> 54:39.981
We'll hit them once more
just to be on the safe side.

54:40.527 --> 54:43.644
Give me your phone.
You don't have a phone?

54:43.781 --> 54:46.147
A phone will give anyone
your precise location.

54:46.241 --> 54:48.903
And yet they're so useful
for making phone calls.

54:48.994 --> 54:51.360
Excellent.
I'm not phoning anyone.

54:52.122 --> 54:55.034
I'm gathering evidence.

54:56.919 --> 55:00.753
The target list, Jason. Four
iconic central London landmarks.

55:00.881 --> 55:02.963
Make your selection.
Number three.

55:03.091 --> 55:04.922
The London eye.

55:06.178 --> 55:11.389
This cyber attack could potentially
impact 16,000 visitors.

55:16.730 --> 55:19.221
I found him snooping
around upstairs.

55:20.317 --> 55:22.228
And who are you exactly?

55:22.361 --> 55:23.817
I'm not telling you anything.

55:23.904 --> 55:24.939
Hmm.

55:25.989 --> 55:28.150
Face recognition
software launched.

55:28.492 --> 55:31.950
Johnny English is a geography
teacher from lincolnshire.

55:32.412 --> 55:36.246
Rather heavily armed for a lesson
on European capitals, Mr. English.

55:38.752 --> 55:39.958
Any thoughts, sweetheart?

55:40.963 --> 55:42.874
He's British intelligence.

55:44.174 --> 55:46.335
And there you have I,
two words that have

55:46.426 --> 55:49.338
no right being
in the same sentence together.

55:49.721 --> 55:52.713
Do you really think
I came here alone?

55:53.100 --> 55:56.388
I have a team of crack
operatives out there, right now,

55:56.478 --> 55:57.968
just waiting to strike.

55:58.063 --> 55:59.348
Uh-huh.

56:04.444 --> 56:05.479
Sir!

56:08.699 --> 56:10.985
What has happened
to this country?

56:11.118 --> 56:13.825
How is it possible
that less than a century ago

56:13.912 --> 56:16.904
the British empire
ruled a quarter of the globe

56:17.040 --> 56:20.624
and now it's relying on someone

56:21.795 --> 56:24.207
like you?

56:28.760 --> 56:29.795
Hey! Stop!

56:31.138 --> 56:32.138
Stop him?

56:46.069 --> 56:47.069
Go.

56:55.537 --> 56:56.947
- Close the gates.
- Yes, sir.

57:07.841 --> 57:09.172
Help! Stop!

57:09.259 --> 57:11.625
Obstacle directly ahead,
Mrs. trattner.

57:11.762 --> 57:15.675
Check your mirrors
and bring the car to a stop.

57:18.018 --> 57:19.724
Er, excuse me. Hey.

57:21.730 --> 57:22.730
Thank you.

57:26.318 --> 57:27.318
Drive!

57:29.613 --> 57:30.613
Excuse me.

57:30.697 --> 57:32.437
What... what do you think
you're doing?

57:32.532 --> 57:35.114
Excuse me! You are not a
qualified instructor.

57:44.294 --> 57:46.535
But what about my instructor?
Turn left.

57:46.630 --> 57:47.665
On.

57:48.548 --> 57:49.583
Turn right.

57:54.012 --> 57:56.549
For future reference,
I'm on your left.

57:56.890 --> 58:00.382
Please, stop.
I can't do this anymore!

58:04.773 --> 58:06.354
I can't see anything now!

58:06.858 --> 58:07.858
Good.

58:19.538 --> 58:21.494
When I say "go,"
turn sharp right.

58:21.581 --> 58:22.787
Uh-huh.

58:26.586 --> 58:28.827
Three, two, one.

58:29.339 --> 58:30.339
Gol

58:33.593 --> 58:35.504
and straighten up,
straighten up, straighten up.

58:35.595 --> 58:36.801
And go!

58:37.597 --> 58:38.597
Let's go, let's go.

58:47.399 --> 58:49.310
Oh, now just bear left
a little. Good.

58:49.735 --> 58:51.100
Straighten up, straighten up.

58:55.574 --> 58:56.574
Good!

59:00.704 --> 59:02.990
Well, that was
very good, Mrs. trattner.

59:05.751 --> 59:07.958
I think you made
some real progress today.

59:09.546 --> 59:11.002
You're not hearing me, English.

59:11.089 --> 59:14.152
Given the prime minister's new friendship
with volta, the situation has changed.

59:14.176 --> 59:18.795
But the facts haven't, sir. That
attack is volta's responsibility.

59:18.889 --> 59:21.346
According to you, but not
according to anyone else.

59:21.433 --> 59:22.843
Is he here yet?

59:23.477 --> 59:25.843
Good afternoon, prime minister.
So, this is, uh...

59:26.104 --> 59:28.891
English, prime minister.
Johnny English.

59:29.191 --> 59:31.682
What exactly do you have
to say for yourself?

59:31.985 --> 59:33.725
Rather a lot, actually.

59:34.029 --> 59:37.613
However, men like me don't deal
in prevarication, prime minister,

59:37.699 --> 59:39.360
so let me get
straight to the point.

59:39.451 --> 59:42.693
Jason volta is the man
behind these attacks.

59:42.788 --> 59:45.370
And I have the evidence
to prove it.

59:46.416 --> 59:50.125
I managed to record this
inside volta's country lair.

59:50.253 --> 59:51.743
But I should warn you,
prime minister,

59:51.880 --> 59:55.793
that what you're about to see
is evil incarnate.

59:57.803 --> 59:59.009
Hmm.

01:00:01.223 --> 01:00:04.181
Here we are
at Fifi's third birthday!

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:06.508
And it's a very exciting day!

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:11.055
Hip hip, hooray!
Hip hip, hooray!

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:15.272
Happy birthday to you

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:20.280
happy birthday to you

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.660
thank you.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.532
Can I just ask,
what is wrong with you?

01:00:26.832 --> 01:00:29.198
The country is in a state
of complete chaos.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:30.452
The press is wetting itself,

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:32.500
and the only person
capable of saving us

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:34.828
is the man you're accusing
of high treason.

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:39.087
I was in the room myself when he
gave the order, prime minister!

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:40.425
But there was a...

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:42.198
Do you know what I was
in the room with, English?

01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:43.908
Your file, which I've read,
in its entirety,

01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:45.012
and I have a few questions.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.636
Did you or did you not burn

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:49.183
the cote de roc restaurant in
antibes to the ground?

01:00:49.271 --> 01:00:50.351
Um...

01:00:50.438 --> 01:00:52.804
And did you or did you not
fire a guided missile

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:54.556
at a peloton of French cyclists?

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:56.110
Well...

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.646
Before commandeering
an open-top bus

01:00:57.779 --> 01:00:59.895
and tossing the tour guide
off the top deck,

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:02.343
and then assaulting an 82-year-old
grandmother in a sandwich shop

01:01:02.367 --> 01:01:04.608
before battering the employee
of said sandwich shop

01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:06.614
with two organic
sourdough baguettes?

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.487
Uh, I don't remember the...

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:12.707
Do you have any idea
how hard itis to be me?

01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:15.911
- Uh...
- Hmm?

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.831
Do you have even
the foggiest notion

01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:22.459
of how virtually impossible
it is to get anything done

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:27.260
in the face of events
and facts and voters

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:30.509
and that Tsunami of tosspots
we call "the national press"?

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:33.978
Finally I get the chance to do
something good for my country,

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:35.305
and what happens?

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:38.024
The universe sends me you.

01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:41.315
Well, do you know what I say?

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:44.318
I say, up the universe's arse!

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:46.487
And do you know what else I say?
You're fired.

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:48.614
With immediate effect.
Now get out!

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:53.036
And make sure I never clap eyes
on that imbecile ever again!

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:36.832
What are you doing, sir?

01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:41.038
What do you think I'm doing,
bough? I'm going home.

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.836
But the prime minister is
finalizing her deal with volta.

01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:47.211
She's taking him to the g12 summit
in Scotland as her special guest.

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:51.340
It's over, bough. And there's
absolutely nothing we can do about it.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.722
But, sir, I have a plan.

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:56.891
Remember my wife?

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:07.067
Clear your baffles.

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.570
What?
Mind your head, sir.

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:10.741
Owl

01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:15.072
this says we're sinking.

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:23.622
She's old and a little rusty, but she can
put on a hell of a fireworks display.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:42.311
Excellent work, commander.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:45.397
Jeremy has always spoken very
highly of you, agent English.

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:47.573
Who?

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:50.652
On.

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:52.405
Oh, yes, yes.

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:56.405
I'm no fan of the pen
pushers myself, so

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.519
when orders came through
stationing us here for the summit,

01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:00.955
well, I thought a lift was
the least I could do.

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:03.207
Right, let's get
a move on, bough.

01:04:04.632 --> 01:04:06.444
Oh, if you wouldn't mind
keeping your mobiles off

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:07.828
until you're well clear,
gentlemen.

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:10.377
The launch systems on the
missiles are a bit 1980s.

01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:13.214
Gets a tad twitchy
around microwave radiation.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:17.343
No problem there, commander. We're
doing this mission old-school.

01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:29.150
This spot is perfect.

01:04:30.742 --> 01:04:32.073
Come on.

01:04:47.592 --> 01:04:48.592
Sorry, sir.

01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:50.132
Come on, come on...

01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:53.753
Right, bough. Our
mission here is simple.

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:57.299
Gain access to volta's bedroom
and take him out.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.527
How are you going to get
up there, though, sir?

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:03.351
A walk in the park
for the exoskeleton.

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:12.860
Remotely operated
neoprene bodysuit.

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:15.904
Increases the wearer's
strength 100 times.

01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:19.575
Right, power it up. Stick in
the floppy disk and let's go.

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:28.882
Just...

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:46.564
Crikey, sir!

01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:04.832
When will the weapon be ready?

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:08.579
As soon as the prime minister
signs the agreement, tonight.

01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:10.046
How do I fire it?

01:06:10.175 --> 01:06:12.757
Press once and the attack
is launched.

01:06:13.011 --> 01:06:16.469
After which, the data
of every g12 country

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:20.090
will be transferred to the
servers onboard the dot calm.

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:21.185
Perfect.

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:23.934
Ah.

01:06:25.356 --> 01:06:26.356
Cheers.

01:06:34.782 --> 01:06:38.070
You're working for Russian intelligence
and you have been from the start.

01:06:38.578 --> 01:06:41.378
Which is why I've taken an antidote
to the poison you keep in your ring,

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:43.075
and which you've poured
into this drink.

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:47.120
And removed the firing pin
from that pistol.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:57.926
Everyone has to make a life
for themselves.

01:06:58.223 --> 01:07:00.339
It's just sad that yours is

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:02.469
over.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.640
Hmm.

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:07.016
Fresh from my 3D printer.
Hundred percent plastic.

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:11.896
And 100% deadly.

01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:14.982
Killing me won't save you.

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:16.907
Don't bet on it.

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:24.029
Seriously,
this cannot be happening.

01:07:24.249 --> 01:07:26.114
Oh, but itis.

01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:28.328
Drop the gun.

01:07:29.254 --> 01:07:30.585
Get your hands in the air.

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:32.548
And you.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:41.925
There's no time
for this, Johnny.

01:07:42.809 --> 01:07:44.265
Oh, it isn't possible.

01:07:44.352 --> 01:07:47.094
You cannot be working
with this English idiot!

01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:50.601
Save the pillow talk
for your prison cell, volta.

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:54.776
Are you inside, sir? Yes, yes,
bough, you can power down.

01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:56.985
Everything is under control.

01:07:57.949 --> 01:07:59.280
Shut down.

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:26.261
An historic venue
for an historic meeting.

01:08:26.352 --> 01:08:30.265
The delegates from each g12 member
nation will have their own priorities...

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:43.154
How do we get in now, sir?

01:08:51.919 --> 01:08:53.580
What's the plan?

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:30.075
Hey, you!

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:31.830
Hey!

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:50.679
Thank you very much. I hope
you have everything you need.

01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:08.784
Owl

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:10.574
on behalf of the United Kingdom,

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:14.245
may I welcome you here today to
this ancient meeting chamber

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:16.663
where the great Scottish clans

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:20.539
once settled their differences
and forged new alliances.

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.507
A place I have
specifically chosen

01:10:23.594 --> 01:10:26.802
in order to make
a very special announcement.

01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:28.807
Sir?

01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:34.060
Are you all right, sir? No, I'm
not all right. Get me up, bough.

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:41.313
It's very heavy, sir.
I know how heavy it is, bough.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.946
We've got to get
to the conference...

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:50.076
To the conference room
before volta...

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:53.996
Before volta triggers
his weapon.

01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:59.331
And so, with my signature
on this agreement...

01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:03.130
It gives me great pleasure, oh,

01:11:03.217 --> 01:11:07.927
to welcome to you my guest,
my friend, Jason volta.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:14.183
Standing
by to launch attack, Jason.

01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:16.640
Damn it, get me out of this stuff.
Johnny?

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:18.764
I can't see the join, sir.
It's the clasp.

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.858
Release the clasp and the top
and the bottom separate.

01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:25.777
Must have jammed
when you fell over, sir.

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.984
For goodness sake.
Wait. Try this.

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:36.865
That is quite a lot of oil, sir.

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.372
Oh, come on!
Come on, come on...

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:45.215
Can you imagine what the world would
look like if it was run by apple?

01:11:46.677 --> 01:11:49.089
Or Google? Or...

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:50.719
Me?

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:56.058
Do you think
you'd have failing schools?

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.145
Do you think you'd have endless
waiting in your hospitals?

01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:00.232
No.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:03.058
Think you'd have such long
lines in your airports?

01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:04.730
- No.
- No.

01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:09.485
No, because all of these are
simple data management problems.

01:12:09.617 --> 01:12:12.279
And people like me,
we love data.

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:15.699
We live for data.

01:12:16.123 --> 01:12:17.829
Ha!
My...

01:12:17.959 --> 01:12:20.291
Do you know
what I live for, volta?

01:12:20.378 --> 01:12:21.378
God.

01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:26.832
Eliminating the threat that lying
villains like you pose to this country.

01:12:27.134 --> 01:12:28.340
Oh, for god's sake.

01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:30.172
Who is he?

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:31.756
Arrest this whack job.

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:34.972
The only person ordering an
arrest around here will be me.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:38.134
There's no cause for concern,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:42.935
you are now in the capable hands
of her majesty's secret service.

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:47.940
And you, my friend, are in for
an uncomfortable ride.

01:13:04.463 --> 01:13:05.794
Where was I?

01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:08.998
Living for data.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:10.465
Exactly.

01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:16.798
My algorithms can solve every one of your
problems as long as I have one thing.

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:17.973
Control.

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:21.977
And that is what you are about
to give me now.

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:24.768
Jason, I wonder
if you could just clarify...

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:25.939
Shut up.

01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:27.725
Now, hold on.

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.732
Castle now locked down

01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:34.023
and under your control, Jason.

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:38.407
The agreement this ignoramus
just signed

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:41.159
didn't just give me access
to all the uk's data.

01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:45.251
It also gave me access to a
junction box, in north ayrshire

01:13:45.379 --> 01:13:47.916
that connects
the entire world wide web.

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:53.881
Disable the fiber-optic cables in that box
and the Internet will cease to exist.

01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:57.763
Johnny? Are you okay?

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:07.940
Have you got a phone?
We need to call for backup.

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:10.985
There's no time for backup.
I'm going after volta.

01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:12.778
And don't lose that one!

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:17.737
Do you understand what it means
if I turn the Internet off?

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:22.288
Cities will go dark. Planes
will fall out of the sky.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.458
Trains will collide.
Law and order will break down

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:29.412
and the world as you know it
will be over.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:32.748
Show, don't tell, right?

01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:38.546
Initiating attack, Jason.

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:41.466
Taking control of junction box.

01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:47.472
Suspending Internet and electricity
supply across britain and Europe.

01:14:48.526 --> 01:14:50.938
Stage one of attack complete.

01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:54.733
Ladies and gentlemen.
I can stop the attack

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:58.316
as long as each of you signs the same
agreement as the prime minister,

01:14:58.411 --> 01:15:00.402
giving me complete control.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.740
Your call.

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:06.369
Welcome to British intelligence.
Get me Pegasus!

01:15:06.794 --> 01:15:10.537
For mis, press one.
For m16, press two.

01:15:10.965 --> 01:15:13.297
For mi7, press three.

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:23.053
Eight g12 signatures
now acquired.

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:26.685
Signal the chopper,
we're almost done here.

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:28.892
For accounts, press five.

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:31.315
For childcare services, press six.
Oh, come on!

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:33.776
For more options, press seven.

01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:37.323
What?

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:43.908
Only two further signatures required to
achieve control of g12 nations’ data.

01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:46.159
All uk data

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:49.037
now successfully transferred
to the dot calm.

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:52.662
- For Aphrodite, press one.
- For Pegasus, press two.

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:56.217
Oh, my god.

01:15:56.302 --> 01:16:00.011
Dive the submarine.
Repeat, dive the submarine.

01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:04.924
Director's office?
This is Johnny English.

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:09.270
I need to speak to Pegasus immediately.
It's a national emergency.

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:10.888
One moment, please, sir.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:13.895
This is hms vengeance.

01:16:14.028 --> 01:16:17.646
We have a full launch code.
Repeat, launch code is locked.

01:16:17.782 --> 01:16:19.773
Do I have your permission
to fire?

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:22.241
Oh, my god. Could you hold on
one moment, please?

01:16:22.369 --> 01:16:24.109
Sir? Sirl

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:26.081
hello?

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:27.332
Hello?

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:30.533
Sir! Hms vengeance here. Do I
have your permission to launch?

01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:33.581
What? Listen, we have
to call in an attack.

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:34.912
Did you say "attack," sir?

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:41.381
General quarters,
we are go for launch.

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:43.425
Target coordinates locked,
commander.

01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:44.557
Hello?

01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:47.512
Hello?

01:16:57.947 --> 01:17:00.484
Commander, the missile
is being redirected.

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:03.987
It seems to be locking on
to a new hostile target.

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:07.987
What's a "sherbet f"?

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:21.417
- Oh, no.
- What was that?

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:26.009
Dot calm appears
to be offline, Jason.

01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:28.845
The cyber attack
has been halted.

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:34.229
Did you

01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:37.190
make a call quite close
to the submarine, sir?

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:41.187
Um...

01:17:41.282 --> 01:17:42.362
Because...

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:44.698
You did it, sir!

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:47.610
Mission accomplished!

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:49.654
Well, exactly!

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:54.500
I am re-evaluating
our options, Jason.

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.841
Johnny! Johnny!

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:06.011
Volta is getting away! He's
heading for his helicopter!

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:07.383
No, bough.

01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:10.262
This one's mine.

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:45.547
Careful, sir. Sir?

01:18:56.607 --> 01:18:58.268
Last two steps, sir.

01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:05.275
Not so fast, volta!

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:08.991
Is this supposed to scare me,
sir Lancelot?

01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:15.364
Take cover, bough.

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:25.545
Don't worry, he's only got six
bullets in that thing.

01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:30.720
And, of course,
the thing itself.

01:19:33.143 --> 01:19:35.179
You've run out
of options, volta.

01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:37.306
Oh, you think you've won?

01:19:37.398 --> 01:19:38.604
Mmm.

01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:42.228
Rerouting the attack
to our Nevada servers, Jason.

01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:46.854
The world's going down, English.
And I'll be the last man standing.

01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:50.528
Goodbye, English!
Goodbye, Internet.

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:56.451
I've got it. That's a gazelle
341 light attack helicopter.

01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:59.533
If we can hack into
its operating system,

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.786
we can disable
the drive function.

01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:03.089
Here.

01:20:06.927 --> 01:20:11.045
Look at you! You couldn't use that
thing if your life depended on it!

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:15.383
Let's get outta here.

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:17.809
Get this steel bird in the...

01:20:23.027 --> 01:20:27.942
Rerouting complete. Attack data now
installed at our Nevada servers.

01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:30.151
Should I initiate?

01:20:30.576 --> 01:20:31.576
Jason?

01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:38.409
Should I initiate
the new attack?

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.951
Initiate this!

01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:44.458
Jason.

01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:57.057
Well, uh, ladies and gentlemen.

01:20:57.186 --> 01:21:01.054
I think we can all agree, that wasn't
quite the evening we were expecting.

01:21:06.403 --> 01:21:08.394
I had hoped to present
to you tonight...

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:10.816
Thank you. A vision of
what britain might be.

01:21:11.241 --> 01:21:14.984
But, as it happens, the man who
saved us all this evening,

01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:18.617
the man who, I might add, I
personally assigned to this case,

01:21:19.249 --> 01:21:21.456
has presented us with a
different kind of vision.

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:25.832
A living embodiment, if you like, of
those fundamental British qualities

01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:30.212
that have ensured that our
beloved island nation endures.

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:33.631
Courage under fire,
endless ingenuity

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:35.633
and above all, a quiet

01:21:36.266 --> 01:21:38.973
unassailable dignity.

01:21:58.122 --> 01:21:59.362
Thank you.

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:07.957
All together.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:20.557
Welcome back, Mr. English.

01:22:20.644 --> 01:22:21.804
Thank you, headmaster.

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:23.665
Thank you for agreeing
to be our guest speaker.

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:26.476
Now the governors and staff are all
waiting for us in the rose garden.

01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:29.479
Yes, if you could just excuse me
for a few minutes, headmaster.

01:22:35.242 --> 01:22:36.242
On.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.360
Morning, sir!
Hello, sir!

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.696
Welcome back, sir!

01:22:45.752 --> 01:22:46.832
Surprise!

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:48.956
Thank you.

01:22:50.174 --> 01:22:51.755
Where's straker?

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:54.462
Here, sir.
Good.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.631
And, of course, baggaley.

01:22:57.931 --> 01:22:59.075
That was very good.
Very good.

01:22:59.099 --> 01:23:00.979
All right, gather round,
everyone. Gather round.

01:23:01.894 --> 01:23:03.805
I've got some toys to show you.

01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:05.432
Ooh!
There we go.

01:23:06.523 --> 01:23:08.809
There we are. There we are.

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:11.400
- Breadstick blowpipe, anyone?
- Me!

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:12.522
There you go.

01:23:12.613 --> 01:23:14.854
Granny Smith hand grenade?

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:17.398
And what about a garroting watch?
Here, sir.

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:18.493
There you go.

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:21.576
Ooh!
Here, let me take that.

01:23:21.705 --> 01:23:23.991
Don't worry,
it's only a mild sedative.

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:27.700
Oh! That's just
a five-second fuse.

01:23:28.962 --> 01:23:31.578
Yes, all right, we all know
what garroting looks like.

01:23:31.715 --> 01:23:33.706
Whenever you're ready,
Mr. English.

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:36.424
Oh, I'm sorry, headmaster,
I'll just be one moment.

01:23:36.553 --> 01:23:38.714
Just take those. Thank you.
Ooh.

01:23:39.598 --> 01:23:42.635
Put those away, shall we?
There we...

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:44.512
Um...

01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:47.185
I always did love a jelly baby.
