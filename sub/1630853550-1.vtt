Thought you'd be too busy
moving in to come to this.

23:23.314 --> 23:25.491
Mm-mm.
Change of plans.

23:25.534 --> 23:28.232
So I came to get my key back
before you get settled.

23:28.276 --> 23:30.539
[chuckles]
Don't tell me the nerves are
getting the best of you, Guerin.

23:30.583 --> 23:33.499
I'm not meant to cohabitate
with Alex, all right?

23:33.542 --> 23:35.152
He's gonna figure that out
soon enough.

23:35.196 --> 23:36.763
Yeah, it still sounds like
nerves to me.

23:36.806 --> 23:40.549
I broke something
really important to Alex today,

23:40.593 --> 23:41.768
and I can't fix it.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.552
Because that's what
I do, Dallas.

23:43.596 --> 23:45.249
That's what I always do.

23:45.293 --> 23:48.252
I was once a kid with
trash bags for suitcases, too.

23:48.296 --> 23:51.255
My thing? No matter
the foster home I was in,

23:51.299 --> 23:54.650
I felt like I was
the broken thing in it.

23:54.694 --> 23:58.741
But eventually I realized
home is what you make it.

23:58.785 --> 24:03.006
Alex isn't gonna care about
some thing that you broke.

24:03.050 --> 24:05.139
'Cause what's more important
to him is you.

24:06.357 --> 24:09.273
You gotta find the courage
to push past this, Guerin.

24:09.317 --> 24:11.275
'Cause if you don't,
if you run now,

24:11.319 --> 24:13.713
you'll be risking everything.

24:15.366 --> 24:17.194
ALEX:
Hey, I got your text.

24:17.238 --> 24:18.761
And have you crunched
the analytics

24:18.805 --> 24:20.241
for your weather balloons?

24:20.284 --> 24:23.113
Yeah. Heat, uh, is up
1.3 degrees an hour

24:23.157 --> 24:25.289
for the last three
over Roswell at large.

24:25.333 --> 24:26.813
Even though barometric pressure
and wind direction

24:26.856 --> 24:28.162
dictates it should be falling.

24:28.205 --> 24:30.469
Not to mention that
the ground conditions

24:30.512 --> 24:31.731
don't match up,

24:31.774 --> 24:34.429
that humidity is up 23%
in the troposphere.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.301
Similar patterns haven't been
present in Roswell since 1947.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.521
Before the crash?After.

24:40.261 --> 24:41.958
Is that why
you've been having me

24:42.002 --> 24:43.307
look at the sky for months?

24:43.351 --> 24:45.005
Is that why you had me
studying locusts

24:45.048 --> 24:46.485
that had shifted
their migrational course?

24:46.528 --> 24:48.965
You think they were
affected by the weather?

24:49.009 --> 24:50.140
Potentially.

24:50.184 --> 24:51.490
Because the theory connecting

24:51.533 --> 24:53.013
all of these things is what?

24:53.056 --> 24:55.885
I don't know.
Which I don't like.

24:55.929 --> 24:58.932
Jones caught us off guard.

24:58.975 --> 25:00.847
Then he got his hands
on the Lockhart machine

25:00.890 --> 25:02.762
to presumably reach others.

25:02.805 --> 25:04.807
Yeah, but you said
he never made a call, so...

25:04.851 --> 25:07.331
I said I don't believe he did.

25:07.375 --> 25:10.639
These anomalies we're discussing
could be nothing.

25:10.683 --> 25:13.033
Yeah, or it's something
we need to account for.

25:14.121 --> 25:15.992
So what do we do next?

25:16.036 --> 25:18.995
Alex and I are going
to wait for data.

25:19.039 --> 25:21.389
You are going to Bar-mageddon.

25:21.432 --> 25:24.653
[laughs]
Your solve is that I drink
a Rocket-Weisen?

25:24.697 --> 25:27.700
You're here so much
the janitors dust you.

25:27.743 --> 25:30.354
You've spent months finding
a cure for your friend.

25:30.398 --> 25:33.096
You took over Darby's work
on locusts the moment you could.

25:33.140 --> 25:36.360
You need perspective, Kyle.

25:36.404 --> 25:38.754
You have to get outside
of these walls to do that.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.673
Love the skull, Evans.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.719
[laughs]
Thank you.

25:46.762 --> 25:50.287
Uh, yeah, Liz kindly capped
the quota at our house at six,

25:50.331 --> 25:51.724
Mm....so...

25:51.767 --> 25:53.508
had to find a home for Earl.

25:53.552 --> 25:57.991
So, tell me about the proposal.

25:58.034 --> 25:59.906
[chuckles]Who cried more?

25:59.949 --> 26:02.038
Uh, I didn't stick the landing.

26:02.082 --> 26:03.866
Or the middle part.

26:03.910 --> 26:05.172
It wasn't the right time.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.695
Hmm.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.175
What is-- what is "hmm"?

26:08.218 --> 26:12.048
Just me cluing in
to why you're denying

26:12.092 --> 26:15.356
these robbers are from...

26:17.663 --> 26:20.448
Look... Liz,

26:20.491 --> 26:23.146
for both good and bad,

26:23.190 --> 26:24.887
pushes the world away for you.

26:24.931 --> 26:28.717
And I just... I just want to
make sure that's what you need.

26:28.761 --> 26:30.240
Hmm.

26:30.284 --> 26:33.200
Is there, like,
a little residual something

26:33.243 --> 26:34.331
about us as a couple?

26:34.375 --> 26:35.724
No, okay?Okay.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.813
And I like Liz.

26:37.857 --> 26:40.773
But... [sighs] I love you.

26:42.122 --> 26:43.427
And as your friend,

26:43.471 --> 26:45.952
I want to cry at your wedding

26:45.995 --> 26:47.431
knowing that my friend

26:47.475 --> 26:49.216
made the best step
that he could.

26:51.131 --> 26:52.523
Well...

26:54.351 --> 26:56.266
...as much as I appreciate
you being able to

26:56.310 --> 26:58.355
ask the hard questions...

26:58.399 --> 27:02.272
But, uh, my future isn't

27:02.316 --> 27:04.274
in the stars, okay?

27:04.318 --> 27:05.667
It's right here with Liz.

27:05.711 --> 27:08.931
And my assessment
of these bank robbers

27:08.975 --> 27:13.240
is based purely on evidence.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.285
Okay.

27:15.329 --> 27:20.639
But in the unlikely event
that you're wrong,

27:20.682 --> 27:22.510
please tell me
you've been working out

27:22.553 --> 27:25.295
those new alien powers you said
that clone of yours had.

27:25.339 --> 27:28.777
Okay? 'Cause these robbers
happen to be alien.

27:28.821 --> 27:31.824
You know, some stronger alien
powers could come in handy.

27:31.867 --> 27:35.654
I don't need alien powers
to defeat bank robbers.

27:35.697 --> 27:39.353
All right? Terrestrial or
extra, it doesn't matter.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.311
All I need is to be a good cop.

27:41.355 --> 27:43.270
Okay.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.752
Just, uh...

27:46.795 --> 27:48.754
don't let happiness
be a handcuff.

27:48.797 --> 27:51.495
DISPATCHER [over comm]:
Got a 27-2 in progress

27:51.539 --> 27:53.236
at West Pecos Bank and Trust.

27:54.368 --> 27:55.674
Let's go get 'em.

28:00.069 --> 28:02.681
[tires screeching]

28:05.858 --> 28:07.294
Put your hands up!

28:11.690 --> 28:13.692
[high-pitched ringing][wind whooshing]

28:16.390 --> 28:18.609
[indistinct shouting]

28:23.353 --> 28:24.833
[tires screeching]

28:24.877 --> 28:26.269
Damn it!

28:26.313 --> 28:28.663
Alien enough for you, Evans?

28:30.839 --> 28:32.711
[siren wailing]

28:34.756 --> 28:36.236
Okay, Little Green
Sheriff, time to down

28:36.279 --> 28:37.716
a power line or something.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.630
No, that's dangerous
and not exactly inconspicuous.

28:39.674 --> 28:41.023
Okay, well, we gotta
do something before

28:41.067 --> 28:43.286
the getaway car gets
to the getaway ship.

28:48.248 --> 28:50.772
I need a unit blocking the alley
on Von Folsom and West.

28:50.816 --> 28:53.035
Two units block Banner
and Pratt.

28:53.079 --> 28:55.734
Push them into the alley
behind the hardware store.

29:03.089 --> 29:04.743
[tires screeching]

29:08.311 --> 29:09.791
[siren wailing]

29:30.551 --> 29:32.727
Brains over alien
brawn for the W.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.382
Which one of us cuffs them?

29:38.254 --> 29:40.953
[high-pitched ringing]

29:47.916 --> 29:50.440
Hold that truck.

29:51.354 --> 29:52.355
Come on, Evans.

29:52.399 --> 29:53.835
Hold the truck.

29:53.879 --> 29:54.967
Hold it!

29:57.012 --> 29:58.492
[grunts]
[exhales]

30:03.758 --> 30:05.629
[festive music playing]Hey.

30:05.673 --> 30:07.109
Hi, what can I get you?

30:07.153 --> 30:09.851
Is that... Kyle Valenti?

30:09.895 --> 30:10.939
[laughs softly]

30:10.983 --> 30:13.463
What brings you
into the wild?

30:13.507 --> 30:16.336
I came to support Team Liz.Oh, that's sweet.

30:16.379 --> 30:19.382
How about you join
the dark side

30:19.426 --> 30:21.515
and come and
support Team Iz?

30:21.558 --> 30:24.997
We're gonna take two
E. Tequila Sunrises, please.You got it.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.825
What's this about?

30:26.868 --> 30:29.653
Okay, I have something
that I have to tell someone,

30:29.697 --> 30:31.264
and I don't know how
to come clean.

30:31.307 --> 30:34.180
Okay. Okay.

30:34.223 --> 30:35.790
Uh...

30:35.834 --> 30:37.618
You were brave enough
to sell your house,

30:37.661 --> 30:39.663
sell your event business
and commit to

30:39.707 --> 30:41.056
a whole new way of life.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.972
So, as the head sensei
at Woman As Warrior,

30:44.016 --> 30:46.279
what would you tell a student
if they came to you?

30:46.322 --> 30:47.541
Here you go.

30:50.457 --> 30:54.069
I would tell them that...

30:54.113 --> 30:57.943
the feelings you suppress
eventually betray you.

30:57.986 --> 31:02.686
Secrets, they tear you apart
from the inside, you know.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.297
Anything that
you try to bury

31:04.340 --> 31:06.821
is going to wind up popping up
right in front of you

31:06.865 --> 31:09.476
until you have the courage
to just face it.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.826
Could not agree more.

31:11.870 --> 31:15.525
So I would tell them
just say it. You know?

31:15.569 --> 31:17.832
'Cause the truth will
set you free.

31:19.703 --> 31:22.184
[chuckles]
Yeah.

31:22.228 --> 31:24.143
I really do love you.

31:26.406 --> 31:27.973
Thank you.

31:29.757 --> 31:31.280
So... [clears throat]

31:31.324 --> 31:32.803
tell me...

31:32.847 --> 31:35.502
who's the truth bomb for,
Max or Michael?

31:35.545 --> 31:37.808
Actually... Anatsa.Hmm?

31:39.245 --> 31:40.986
Right.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.813
Of course.

31:48.819 --> 31:51.561
Mija,where you going?

31:51.605 --> 31:53.737
Oh, I got to go find
my student Vanessa.

31:53.781 --> 31:55.652
Tommy said she's
been swiping beers,

31:55.696 --> 31:58.133
and I just, I have to have a--Churro?

31:58.177 --> 31:59.395
[chuckles]

31:59.439 --> 32:00.962
I'm your father.

32:01.006 --> 32:02.964
And I know
every look on your face.

32:03.008 --> 32:05.140
And I know the one you wear now
is not about some...

32:05.184 --> 32:06.968
problematic student.

32:07.012 --> 32:09.753
But Vanessa is a
little lost and I'm...

32:09.797 --> 32:11.625
trying to help
her find her way.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.148
Okay? She's just
not having it.

32:13.192 --> 32:15.411
Maybe... because it's hard

32:15.455 --> 32:17.239
to take that kind of advice

32:17.283 --> 32:19.763
from someone who hasn't found
their way themselves.

32:19.807 --> 32:22.157
I have found my way.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.202
With Max?

32:23.245 --> 32:24.943
Yes, finally.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.600
There's just still some...

32:30.644 --> 32:33.081
Confusion.

32:36.476 --> 32:38.478
Do you love him?

32:38.521 --> 32:40.349
More than anything.

32:40.393 --> 32:42.438
That I know.

32:42.482 --> 32:44.266
Then stop running
from the truth.

32:44.310 --> 32:48.096
Take the time to figure out
what you want.

32:48.140 --> 32:51.012
What Liz wants, hmm?

32:52.492 --> 32:54.450
I'll support you.

32:54.494 --> 32:57.497
I know Max loves you
and he will, too.

33:10.684 --> 33:13.034
You left your key?

33:16.995 --> 33:19.388
Given my brain's a lockpick,
I didn't need a k...

33:19.432 --> 33:21.086
It's a metaphor,
Guerin.

33:23.610 --> 33:26.047
Look, I was here
for 12 minutes,

33:26.091 --> 33:29.050
and I messed up the disposal...

33:30.399 --> 33:32.619
...and I broke
a touchstone of sanity

33:32.662 --> 33:34.012
you built with your mom.

33:39.713 --> 33:41.715
This model meant
the world to me.

33:43.195 --> 33:44.500
But it doesn't anymore.

33:44.544 --> 33:46.415
I don't need to build
a pretend world,

33:46.459 --> 33:49.810
when I get the chance to build
the real thing with you.

33:49.853 --> 33:52.073
Aren't you nervous
that after everything

33:52.117 --> 33:54.206
we've been through,
maybe we're wrong about this?

33:55.337 --> 33:57.339
Look.

33:57.383 --> 34:00.734
People get freaked out when they
make life decisions like this.

34:02.866 --> 34:05.826
Hey, I can live
without that gazebo.

34:07.915 --> 34:10.831
What I can't live
without is you.

34:12.093 --> 34:15.227
So why don't you
put your hand in mine?

34:16.489 --> 34:19.187
And we'll start with that, okay?

34:27.891 --> 34:30.633
CLYDE:
It is beautiful what
you've set in motion, Tezca.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.333
Did you collect what we require?

34:41.470 --> 34:43.342
Are you certain this is
the best course to take?

34:45.170 --> 34:46.997
Absolutely.

34:48.825 --> 34:52.090
This is what our Triad
is meant to do.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.925
That's, um...
that's all I got.

35:01.969 --> 35:04.711
Thanks.
Thank you.

35:04.754 --> 35:05.929
[mutters]

35:05.973 --> 35:07.409
How'd your reading go?

35:07.453 --> 35:10.195
I'm having trouble tapping
into my intuition today.

35:10.238 --> 35:13.937
I don't know, my brain's just
not as focused for some reason.

35:13.981 --> 35:15.591
Could be your final dose.

35:15.635 --> 35:17.593
When I was a kid,

35:17.637 --> 35:20.118
new meds would always mess
with me on the first go-round.

35:20.161 --> 35:21.945
Did you come here
to dispense advice

35:21.989 --> 35:24.905
or to lose at chess?

35:27.473 --> 35:29.170
Mm.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.432
Whoa.

35:30.476 --> 35:32.347
