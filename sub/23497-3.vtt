WEBVTT

00:24.358 --> 00:26.360
- How is she beating me?
- We're training, Shay.

00:26.443 --> 00:28.028
-There are no winners.
-The meet's in two days.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.072
Stop stressing.
On race day, you'll crush her.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.824
Or at the very least, she'll blow it.

00:33.742 --> 00:34.910
Nice run, ladies.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.788
Stretch, and we'll talk
when everybody gets back.

00:39.665 --> 00:42.125
All right, 23:36. That deserves a kiss.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.752
I'm all sweaty.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.755
Oh, come on.
That doesn't bother me.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.882
- Okay. Okay, I gotta stretch.

00:50.425 --> 00:53.804
Oh, Shay, you brought
your monthly visitor to practice.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.055
- How cute.
- No.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.306
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Gross!

00:57.933 --> 01:00.769
- Uh--
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:00.853 --> 01:03.438
Does anybody else
smell a butcher shop?

01:03.521 --> 01:06.066
--Uh, feel free to hit the showers.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.110
Did you forget
to put in a tampon?

01:08.193 --> 01:09.444
No! I must've bled through.

01:09.527 --> 01:11.822
Oh, my God, why isn't there something
higher than ultra-absorbent?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.031
It's not that bad.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.784
I mean, it's bad.
It's just... It's not like, Ebola.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.745
Do you think they sell
"Sorry for bleeding on you" cards?

01:17.828 --> 01:19.121
Okay. First, clean up.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.915
And then maybe offer
to dry-clean his pants?

01:23.416 --> 01:26.461
-Where are you going?
-Into hiding. Forever.

01:27.004 --> 01:31.925
♪ Whatever it takes
I know I can make it through ♪

01:33.551 --> 01:38.140
♪ And if I hold out
I know I can make it through ♪

01:42.352 --> 01:47.315
♪ Be the best, be the best
The best that I can be ♪

01:47.399 --> 01:50.110
♪ Whatever it takes ♪

01:50.193 --> 01:53.947
♪ I know I can make it
I know I can make it through ♪

01:58.702 --> 02:02.289
The Japanese military
used kamikaze attacks, because...

02:02.372 --> 02:07.210
defeat or capture was considered
worse than death.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.129
Which is a hangover
from samurais, right?

02:09.212 --> 02:10.505
Bushido or whatever?

02:10.588 --> 02:14.176
Okay. So do suicide bombers, for example,
think that they're honorable,

02:14.259 --> 02:16.011
like... like modern samurai?

02:21.391 --> 02:24.061
Why would I have the inside scoop
on suicide bombers?

02:24.144 --> 02:25.646
Well, aren't they mostly Muslim?

02:26.980 --> 02:29.024
Islam does not condone killing.

02:29.107 --> 02:32.277
Well, I don't see any G.I. Joes
strapping bombs to their chest.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.198
Instead,
they drop them from drones.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.409
And calling suicide bombers Muslim
is an insult to Muslims everywhere.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.622
A note to leave on.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.417
That was amazing.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.544
It makes me wish
we had every class together.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.088
How is everyone so clueless?

02:51.171 --> 02:52.380
- Don't they know how to google?

02:52.464 --> 02:55.675
If I had a nickel for every time
somebody asked me about that stuff...

02:55.759 --> 02:58.553
As if wearing a hijab makes you an expert.

02:58.636 --> 03:01.431
So, um, I'll see you at home?
We got a lot of Friends to binge on.

03:01.514 --> 03:05.143
Friends sounds good, but I feel bad
keeping you from your friends.

03:06.228 --> 03:08.605
What if we invited some of them
over tonight?

03:08.688 --> 03:11.274
Oh, people here
don't really like '90s sitcoms.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.110
Then we can just hang out.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.278
Who knows,
maybe we'll even teach them to google.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.920
Um, about yesterday,
I just wanted to say that I'm--

03:32.004 --> 03:35.048
Close your eyes.
Got you something.

03:36.508 --> 03:37.718
Go on.
Close 'em.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.014
I'm so sorry about your pants.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.807
I can get you new ones if you want.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.476
Don't worry about that, Shay.
It's just pants.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.314
Okay, open 'em.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.694
Uh, are... are those wrong?

03:56.779 --> 03:58.947
'Cause I got you these, too.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.200
Are you trying to embarrass me?

04:02.284 --> 04:04.619
-But Esme said--
-You talked to Esme?

04:04.702 --> 04:06.163
About my...  period?

04:06.246 --> 04:07.998
Did I... did I do something wrong?

04:08.081 --> 04:09.416
You think?

04:18.508 --> 04:20.427
Whoa, someone's prepared.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.012
That's what I always liked about you,
Shay.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.889
Always willing to go with the flow.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.741
So, just to clarify...

04:43.826 --> 04:46.619
you guys want funds to produce a play
about Degrassi's bus crash?

04:47.955 --> 04:49.456
Very bold.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.958
Uh, what's the story?

04:51.041 --> 04:53.085
Uh, we're not sure yet.
Maya's working on it.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.962
-Where is Maya?
-Uh...

04:55.045 --> 04:58.673
Oh, uh, okay, that's a great question.

04:58.756 --> 05:02.260
Okay, so Simpson asked us
to stay away from anything triggering.

05:02.344 --> 05:05.973
Fair enough, but we should give them
a chance to flesh it out.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.309
Come back then.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.103
Okay.
Awesome.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.148
-Anything else?
-Ah, actually, yes.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.818
I motion we have an evening
of student council bonding

05:17.901 --> 05:19.111
at my house tonight.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.404
You're inviting us over to hang out?

05:21.488 --> 05:24.324
We could play games, like charades.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.869
Charades?
I am a master of mimery.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.996
I can order pizza,
and you guys can get to know Rasha.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.122
Rasha?

05:30.205 --> 05:32.415
Yeah, it's hard for girls like her
to make friends.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.709
And it's our job to help her
feel welcome, right?

05:34.792 --> 05:36.962
Good idea.
We'll be there.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.506
--If I can get out of this box.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.822
Hey, can you take these to Tristan
when you see him tonight?

06:04.907 --> 06:06.616
Look, I wasn't really
planning on going tonight.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.368
But you didn't go last night, either.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.494
Well, can't you take them?

06:09.577 --> 06:11.829
I have team building.
Plus, Tristan needs you.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.581
Don't you want to be there if he wakes up?

06:13.665 --> 06:14.832
What could be more important?

06:14.917 --> 06:16.334
He's working at my restaurant.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.462
I wouldn't have asked
if there was literally anyone else,

06:19.546 --> 06:21.881
but Lautaro basically called in dead.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.217
Since when do you two even talk?

06:25.510 --> 06:26.803
-Well...
-Whatever.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.559
Thanks for the save.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.603
It's just...
It's hard see him in that bed.

06:35.687 --> 06:38.523
Yeah. I... I totally get it.
But I was serious about serving tonight.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.446
And he gave it to me right there in class.

06:44.529 --> 06:47.157
-No! Did you die?
-I wish.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.783
Okay.
Well, come on, girl.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.868
I wanna get a good stretch in
before practice.

06:53.205 --> 06:56.124
I'm... sitting this one out.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.335
I'll just tell Armstrong I have cramps.
He'll believe it.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.669
But the meet's tomorrow.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.504
Might sit that out, too.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.382
Wait, actually?

07:04.466 --> 07:05.550
Shay, this isn't you.

07:05.633 --> 07:06.969
What if I have another incident?

07:07.052 --> 07:08.136
Who cares?

07:08.220 --> 07:10.680
People are already calling you
Bloody Mary and Flow Rida and...

07:10.763 --> 07:13.516
Nothing else.
Nothing else at all.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.144
Look, once is an accident.
But twice, and I'm disgusting.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.981
I mean, if Esme hadn't opened her mouth,
I could have gotten away with it.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.524
Well, she's probably one of those girls
with perfect little periods.

07:22.484 --> 07:25.112
Like a nice house guest?
It probably brings her chocolates.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.573
And she probably has no idea how it feels.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.534
Maybe it's time she did.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.704
Okay, two words.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.873
Chicken!
A Chicken.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.000
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
- Um...

07:38.083 --> 07:39.834
--Superman!

07:39.917 --> 07:42.129
Close, close, close!
Um... Is it the Hulk?

07:42.212 --> 07:44.172
-No!
-Yes! Yes! Yes! Okay.

07:44.256 --> 07:46.091
- Up top.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.177
Don't leave me hanging.

07:49.261 --> 07:51.513
I... I can't touch boys.
It's against my beliefs.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.515
Uh, there's a rule against high fives?

07:53.598 --> 07:55.308
Not exactly.

07:55.392 --> 07:58.478
But, like,
one touch leads to another, so...

07:58.561 --> 08:00.730
Uh...
But you've touched Zoë.

08:00.813 --> 08:01.939
Uh, not a boy!

08:02.024 --> 08:03.941
--But you're a lesbian.

08:04.859 --> 08:08.363
Well, the Qur'an doesn't say anything
about touching gay people, so...

08:08.446 --> 08:10.448
Well, what does the Qur'an say
about being gay?

08:11.866 --> 08:14.161
Well, there are many interpretations,

08:14.244 --> 08:17.497
but the most common one
is that it's a sin.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.833
So I'm a sinner?

08:21.418 --> 08:24.754
Rasha, a little help?

08:26.839 --> 08:29.592
Uh, does anyone want more pizza?

08:29.676 --> 08:31.928
I think I'm gonna call it a night.
Um...

08:32.012 --> 08:34.097
It was really nice
hanging with you, Rasha.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.017
Um, I'm gonna go with her.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.230
Why didn't you back me up?

08:42.314 --> 08:44.774
Because I didn't want to contradict you
in front of your friends.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.859
You don't think a high five
really matters, do you?

08:46.943 --> 08:49.196
Yeah, I do.
Because I'm a good Muslim.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.447
So, if someone doesn't follow

08:50.530 --> 08:52.741
every rule in the Qur'an as you see it,
they're a bad Muslim?

08:54.701 --> 08:56.078
Yeah, I guess.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.163
Good to know.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.920
Here you go.
And this go on the side, like this.

09:06.003 --> 09:08.715
Oh, maybe I should pitch
a nachos video for our channel.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.593
Wait, if all this food is Mexican,
what makes this place Argentinean?

09:11.676 --> 09:12.885
Me, obviously.
Okay, go.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.221
Okay.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.568
Nachos, side of guac.

09:28.651 --> 09:32.364
Oh, and our deepest condolences
for our dear friend Tristan.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.532
Excuse me?

09:34.616 --> 09:36.159
Oh, is he still with us?

09:36.243 --> 09:39.871
I figured since you've developed a taste
for that Argentinean spice...

09:43.458 --> 09:45.877
Look, I know you have no
personal experience to corroborate this,

09:45.960 --> 09:47.587
but not every encounter
between a guy and a girl

09:47.670 --> 09:49.046
ends at home base.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.800
Okay, table...
Are you okay?

09:52.884 --> 09:55.720
Look, am I a crappy boyfriend
for not being at Tris' side all the time?

09:55.803 --> 09:57.305
Of course not.
You need bathroom breaks.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.848
--Okay...

09:58.931 --> 10:00.183
It's okay to recharge sometimes.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.643
Who cares what stupid Esme thinks?

10:01.726 --> 10:03.645
Now, table ten's waiting.
Dale.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.696
Hey.
I made your favorite.

10:13.780 --> 10:18.576
Um, about last night...
Things got a little intense,

10:18.660 --> 10:20.578
and I feel awful about it.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.789
Bus'll be here soon.
You ready?

10:22.872 --> 10:25.833
Whoa! Sorry, Rasha. I didn't realize
you didn't have your hijab on.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.043
I'm not wearing it today.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.754
Like, ever?

10:29.837 --> 10:32.840
And thanks, Goldi,
but I'll pass on the bagel.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.390
What happened?

10:41.974 --> 10:43.726
- A high five.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.437
Rasha doesn't think it's a big deal,

10:45.520 --> 10:46.854
and I do.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.232
-So you guys can't be friends anymore?
-Apparently not.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.694
I thought I finally found a friend
who was just like me.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.904
I guess I was wrong.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.659
I'm so sick of feeling
different from everybody else.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.994
Maybe you don't need to be so different.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.415
Okay, so where do I compromise?

11:05.498 --> 11:08.710
If a high five is okay, is a hug?
Or even a kiss?

11:08.793 --> 11:12.088
At what point do I even stop
being a practicing Muslim?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.131
I might as well
just start eating bacon.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.508
No one said anything about bacon,

11:15.592 --> 11:17.469
but you don't have to wear
a hijab to be Muslim.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.681
-I can't just take it off on a whim.
-Rasha did.

11:21.764 --> 11:25.768
Plus, Mom and Dad don't make you wear it.
It's your choice.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.145
Because it makes me feel closer to God.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.732
It's also a giant billboard
that says, "I'm different."

11:33.360 --> 11:36.363
Fitting in is hard enough.
Why make it harder?

11:42.702 --> 11:44.454
Then we multiply this side by two,

11:44.537 --> 11:47.123
which gives us
two aluminum oxide molecules.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.251
Quite the balancing act there, Esme.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.964
Now, I hope you've all taken notes
on what Esme did there,

11:55.047 --> 11:57.509
because it may come up on a test.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.386
Thank you, Esme.
You may take your seat.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.846
Let's move along to molar enthalpies.

12:01.929 --> 12:04.349
These are used in heat calculations.

12:05.308 --> 12:08.770
We'll be looking at the molar enthalpies
of fusion and vaporization--

12:08.853 --> 12:09.896
What the hell?

12:11.898 --> 12:12.899
You!

12:12.982 --> 12:15.151
Do you know how much this skirt cost me?

12:15.234 --> 12:17.194
I... I mean, she embarrassed me.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.322
You're the one embarrassed
about having a vagina!

12:19.406 --> 12:21.240
--That's enough, Esme.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.075
Shay, stick around after class.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.762
Tell me the rumors aren't true.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.975
Okay. They're not true.
What rumor, Zoë?

14:11.058 --> 14:13.060
Are you hooking up with Lola?

14:13.144 --> 14:15.271
-We're just friends.
-Your boyfriend is in a coma,

14:15.354 --> 14:17.774
and you're doing favors
for the first pretty thing that walks by?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.526
So I have to spend
every second by his bed?

14:19.609 --> 14:22.362
No one is saying that.
But... be honest.

14:22.445 --> 14:25.114
Would you really be spending this much
time with Lola if Tris was awake?

14:25.197 --> 14:26.908
Like you're there every night,
"best friend."

14:26.991 --> 14:28.368
All right.
Take your seats.

14:28.451 --> 14:31.871
Today, we're tackling cubic polynomials.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.582
As discussed last class,

14:34.666 --> 14:38.169
a cubic polynomial is a polynomial
of degree three.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.797
So now that we know this,

14:40.880 --> 14:43.633
let's start by solving
the following equation using...

14:54.477 --> 14:59.065
And so Prime Minister Mackenzie King
issued a new policy on immigration.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.274
Sorry, sorry.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.859
Perfect timing, Goldi.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.737
We just started
a discussion on immigration.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.238
How long have you lived here?

15:10.326 --> 15:11.744
My whole life.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.915
Oh, I'm sorry.
I... I thought--

15:15.998 --> 15:18.668
That brown people can't be from here?
Or just Muslims?

15:18.751 --> 15:19.877
Okay, chill.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.255
- It was an innocent mistake.
- Is it a mistake...

15:23.214 --> 15:25.800
when people ask if I'm bald under here?

15:26.551 --> 15:29.053
Or think I know about suicide bombers?

15:29.971 --> 15:33.307
There are 1.6 billion Muslims
in the world, and...

15:34.934 --> 15:36.769
they're all different.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.733
I'm very sorry, Goldi.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.067
Thank you.

15:45.111 --> 15:48.072
Okay.
As I was saying...

15:56.163 --> 15:58.040
What I did in class today was not cool.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.961
I was feeling self-conscious,
and I let it out on you.

16:03.004 --> 16:06.633
Well... that almost makes up
for the $230 skirt.

16:07.424 --> 16:10.302
Oh, and by the way, I got you something.

16:12.514 --> 16:15.642
I hope they fit.
You clearly are the bigger person.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.897
Well, guess we're BFFs now.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.899
You're gonna race?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.860
If I don't,
she'll keep doing crap like this forever.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.820
Why do periods make us so weird?

16:27.904 --> 16:31.032
Because bleeding out of your vagina
for five straight days is gross?

16:31.115 --> 16:34.410
Yeah,
and if I let it stop me from doing this,

16:34.494 --> 16:35.828
what else am I gonna quit?

16:36.913 --> 16:38.956
We have to stop letting it affect us.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.125
Sure, but how?

16:52.428 --> 16:53.638
Can we talk?

17:05.608 --> 17:09.070
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said
what I said last night.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.863
And just with the whole high-five thing,

17:10.947 --> 17:13.074
-I just felt like--
-Our friendship was over?

17:14.826 --> 17:16.661
And then you took off your hijab,

17:16.744 --> 17:20.206
and I tried to, too, because I
just really wanted us to be friends.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.498
But you didn't feel like yourself.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.334
Oh, my God.
You get it.

17:23.417 --> 17:27.338
I didn't wear my hijab
this morning because I was mad.

17:27.421 --> 17:31.258
But if I'm being honest,
I never felt like myself wearing it.

17:31.342 --> 17:34.261
I didn't wear it back home,
not until I was forced to.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.097
Because of ISIS.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.600
Before they messed everything up,
things were pretty liberal.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.517
I'd wear bathing suits to the beach.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.353
In front of boys?

17:42.436 --> 17:44.856
Yeah.
And we'd play games.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.482
And win or lose, we'd shake hands.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.318
I'll always be Muslim,
whether I touch a boy's hand or not.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.527
For me, it's different.

17:50.612 --> 17:54.323
Every single day feels like a choice
between the culture here and my faith.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.701
And if you break any rules,
you feel like you're not Muslim anymore?

17:58.911 --> 18:01.706
Coming here has literally been
a second chance at life.

18:01.789 --> 18:05.376
There is so much I want to do.
And for the first time, it feels possible.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.713
Do you want to join us?

18:09.881 --> 18:11.215
I promise you won't have to touch Winston.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.554
It's crazy, right?

18:18.347 --> 18:20.099
Who would ask me to be a waiter?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.397
Um, other than that...

18:28.899 --> 18:34.155
- things have been...
- really  good.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.413
That's not true.

18:45.582 --> 18:49.586
Everyone thinks... I'm a bad boyfriend.

18:54.175 --> 18:56.343
Being here every day...

18:58.680 --> 19:00.514
waiting for you to wake up...

19:04.393 --> 19:06.688
Just because you're stuck here, I...

19:06.771 --> 19:08.773
Why do I have to be, too? I'm...

19:12.318 --> 19:15.738
I'm trapped, and it's...

19:15.822 --> 19:17.990
it's killing me.

19:19.616 --> 19:23.537
Is there a point to me being here at all?
I feel like I'm just talking to a corpse.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.165
I don't wanna...

19:26.916 --> 19:28.417
I don't want to leave you,

19:29.335 --> 19:31.671
but I don't know
how I can stay.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.550
Wouldn't it be...

19:38.385 --> 19:40.429
amazing if you just woke up right now?

19:46.978 --> 19:48.062
Please?

19:51.941 --> 19:53.567
Come...

19:53.650 --> 19:55.862
Come back to me, Tristan.
Please.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.489
Wake up.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.410
Wake up.
Come on. Wake up.

20:05.788 --> 20:08.290
Wake up.
Wake up.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.461
Wake up!

20:13.587 --> 20:15.339
Wake up. Come on.
I know you can hear...

20:15.422 --> 20:18.634
Wake up. Wake up.
Wake up.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.428
Wake...

20:25.808 --> 20:27.434
Wake up.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.371
What's on their legs?

20:50.332 --> 20:52.084
She's winning! Yeah!

20:52.168 --> 20:54.503
Go, Shay! Yeah!

20:55.712 --> 20:58.966
Yeah, that's my girl right there.
Whoo!

21:00.509 --> 21:02.511
- You were so good.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.556
Oh, you did so well.

21:05.639 --> 21:07.683
You... you were amazing.

21:09.143 --> 21:11.437
Uh...

21:11.520 --> 21:15.524
Um, are... are you all synced up
or something?

21:15.607 --> 21:16.650
-It's paint.
-Ah.

21:16.733 --> 21:19.653
I was tired of being grossed out
by my own body.

21:19.736 --> 21:21.697
I couldn't let it stop me
from doing anything.

21:21.781 --> 21:22.990
I'm... Look, I am...

21:23.074 --> 21:25.785
I'm sorry if, uh,
if I made you feel gross.

21:25.868 --> 21:28.537
No, you didn't.
I did that to myself.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.747
Is it Shark Week already?

21:30.832 --> 21:32.749
You know, that's actually kinda funny.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.425
I kinda wanna kiss you right now.

21:44.511 --> 21:47.014
Miles and I
got to talking last night.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.058
He needs something
to take his mind off of things,

21:49.141 --> 21:51.435
and I thought he could help with the play.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.106
I don't know.

21:55.189 --> 21:58.109
Just hear him out.
Go ahead.

22:00.111 --> 22:04.740
After a bus crash, a guy waits
for his boyfriend in a coma to wake up.

22:04.824 --> 22:10.246
But... he meets this girl online.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.788
Her name is Hope.

22:11.873 --> 22:17.128
And she...
she helps him through his grief.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.715
Does he hook up with Hope?

22:22.967 --> 22:25.177
-No.
-Does the boyfriend wake up?

22:26.845 --> 22:28.097
TBD.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.103
That actually sounds kind of awesome.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.771
Yeah. Uh, agreed.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.148
What do you think?

22:38.815 --> 22:41.235
I think anything about the bus crash
can be triggering,

22:41.318 --> 22:42.945
but I'm willing to take this to Simpson.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.864
-After we see the script, of course.
-Yeah.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.866
Let's, uh,
meet in the music room after school.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.285
Cool?

22:49.368 --> 22:50.536
Can't wait.
Yeah.

22:51.328 --> 22:52.621
Okay, awesome.
