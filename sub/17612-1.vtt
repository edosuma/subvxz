"In our darkest hour,

00:07.353 --> 00:13.893
we commit these souls unsettled
to graves unblessed."

00:13.927 --> 00:16.030
Why's everything a goddamn poem?

00:16.062 --> 00:17.864
Stan! Help me!

00:17.898 --> 00:19.599
She's gonna burn me alive!

00:19.632 --> 00:21.834
28 years.

00:21.867 --> 00:25.004
I was the sheriff for 28 years.

00:25.038 --> 00:26.940
Never got tied to a stake.

00:26.974 --> 00:29.876
You're here exactly one week.

00:32.177 --> 00:33.346
Geez, lady!

00:33.379 --> 00:34.748
Anybody ever tell you

00:34.781 --> 00:36.283
you look like a barrel of assholes?

00:40.087 --> 00:41.654
Ouch.

01:03.341 --> 01:06.077
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

01:06.111 --> 01:10.516
in sure and certain
hope of eternal life.

01:10.549 --> 01:14.320
And of the dear souls
that Claire hath left behind,

01:14.353 --> 01:17.489
none more dear than
her daughter, Denise,

01:17.522 --> 01:22.928
her beloved husband,
our sheriff, Stanley Miller...

01:22.960 --> 01:25.897
or, as we lovingly call him, Stan.

01:27.733 --> 01:29.035
Stanley.

01:30.534 --> 01:32.470
Sheriff Miller.

01:33.904 --> 01:36.841
"Hope will not leave us disappointed.

01:36.874 --> 01:38.075
Because the love of God

01:38.109 --> 01:42.347
has been poured out in our
hearts through the Holy Spirit,

01:42.380 --> 01:44.615
who has been given to us.

01:44.648 --> 01:47.438
At the appointed time,
when we were still powerless,

01:47.439 --> 01:49.608
Christ died for us godless men.

01:49.641 --> 01:51.276
It is rare

01:51.308 --> 01:54.745
that anyone should lay down
his life for a just man,

01:54.778 --> 01:57.415
though it is barely possible
that, for a good man,

01:57.448 --> 02:00.486
someone may have the courage to die."

02:00.519 --> 02:03.154
You want to start some shit with me?

02:03.187 --> 02:05.424
- Stanley, please!
- Eh, clamp.

02:05.457 --> 02:07.593
Someone put you up to this?

02:09.268 --> 02:11.415
- What do you think? It's funny?
- Dad, stop it!

02:11.416 --> 02:13.418
Why can't we just have a nice funeral?!

02:15.285 --> 02:16.754
Come here.

02:21.046 --> 02:21.914
Dad!

02:21.915 --> 02:24.919
No, Stan!

02:27.932 --> 02:29.300
Sheriff Miller!

02:29.332 --> 02:31.169
Sheriff Miller!

02:31.201 --> 02:32.437
Somebody do something!

02:32.469 --> 02:34.905
Sheriff Miller!

02:57.861 --> 02:58.929
Oh, boy.

03:04.986 --> 03:06.887
Oh.

03:07.271 --> 03:08.572
Who the hell are you?

03:08.605 --> 03:10.240
I could ask you the same question.

03:10.241 --> 03:12.778
Of course you could.
That's what women do.

03:12.779 --> 03:13.980
You ask them a question,

03:13.981 --> 03:14.915
and then they answer
your question with a question.

03:15.046 --> 03:16.581
But do they ever answer your question?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.482
No, no, no, no, no.

03:18.516 --> 03:20.518
Because that would be
a sign of weakness.

03:20.551 --> 03:21.986
Am I right?

03:22.018 --> 03:23.021
Are you Sheriff Miller?

03:23.053 --> 03:24.321
Ah.

03:24.355 --> 03:27.458
You just did it again, didn't you?

03:27.491 --> 03:28.359
I'm Evelyn Barret.

03:28.391 --> 03:30.427
- Ah.
- I'm the...

03:30.461 --> 03:32.429
n-new...

03:34.165 --> 03:34.630
Hmm.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.565
They... they said you stepped down.

03:36.597 --> 03:38.900
I-I just assumed your
deputy would be the guy...

03:38.934 --> 03:40.469
Leon? Yeah.

03:40.501 --> 03:42.938
He's about as useful
as tits on a flashlight.

03:42.970 --> 03:46.073
His family owns the
building, so if I can him,

03:46.107 --> 03:47.008
I got to move the whole department

03:47.042 --> 03:48.177
over to the fire station,

03:48.209 --> 03:50.912
and what a nest of
shitheads that place is.

03:50.946 --> 03:52.548
Honest to Christ, since when

03:52.589 --> 03:55.459
does pointing a hose at
something make you a hero?

03:55.459 --> 03:56.494
Give me a break.

03:56.526 --> 03:58.863
Sheriff Miller, have you...

03:58.895 --> 04:00.565
have you been home since...

04:03.366 --> 04:06.436
Not so much. No.

04:26.957 --> 04:28.860
Hello?

05:28.383 --> 05:30.284
You... you want to get shot?

05:30.317 --> 05:32.019
No!

05:32.053 --> 05:34.288
I don't ever want to get shot.

05:36.257 --> 05:37.158
Where have you been?

05:37.192 --> 05:39.661
You haven't been home
in like three days.

05:39.694 --> 05:41.029
I'm starving.

05:41.062 --> 05:43.131
I had some Goldfish at
the wake, and that's it.

05:43.163 --> 05:47.301
I was gonna come home, but, you know...

05:47.334 --> 05:49.670
Well, the bank needs Ma's
life-insurance information.

05:49.704 --> 05:51.305
Yeah, yeah.

05:52.206 --> 05:55.977
All that crap's in your
mother's sewing room, and...

05:56.009 --> 05:56.743
we're not allowed in there.

05:56.778 --> 05:59.081
She locked it, for God's sake.

06:00.014 --> 06:01.816
She called it her sacred space.

06:03.985 --> 06:05.987
Can you imagine what she'd do
if she found me in there?

06:06.019 --> 06:09.254
She'd... she'd...

06:13.728 --> 06:15.764
Oh, God damn it.

06:20.168 --> 06:21.435
I'm so hungry.

06:29.944 --> 06:33.815
You ain't entering the
pie contest, are you?

06:33.848 --> 06:35.717
Big mistake.

06:36.983 --> 06:38.353
Deputy Drinkwater.

06:38.385 --> 06:40.054
Just call me Leon.

06:40.088 --> 06:42.257
Deputy. Evie Barret.

06:42.290 --> 06:45.727
See, if you enter the pie
contest, you might win.

06:45.759 --> 06:47.295
And you don't want that.

06:47.327 --> 06:50.264
You don't want people thinking
you're some flashy outsider.

06:50.298 --> 06:53.968
Boston cop moves out to the
sticks with her big-city pies.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.137
Explain to me again
how you got this job.

06:57.305 --> 07:00.408
Deputy is the job you want
around here, not sheriff.

07:00.440 --> 07:02.376
Here's the deal.

07:02.409 --> 07:06.714
Starting today, you're as good as dead.

07:06.747 --> 07:07.949
So, it's just you and your daughter?

07:07.981 --> 07:10.084
No man around the house?

07:12.019 --> 07:13.721
O-okay, so...

07:14.454 --> 07:16.056
I'm as good as dead

07:16.089 --> 07:17.892
and I shouldn't enter the pie contest?

07:17.925 --> 07:19.728
Mm. There she is.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.462
There's the woman
whose husband left her.

07:21.495 --> 07:22.163
What?

07:22.197 --> 07:23.430
What? No. He didn't lea...

07:23.464 --> 07:25.899
You see, way back in the 1600s,

07:25.932 --> 07:30.370
Willard's Mill had a constable
named Thaddeus Eccles.

07:30.404 --> 07:33.074
You know the witch trials
down in Salem, right?

07:33.106 --> 07:35.876
You know how many witches
they burned down there?

07:35.909 --> 07:36.877
20.

07:36.911 --> 07:37.812
You know how many witches

07:37.846 --> 07:40.148
Thaddeus Eccles burned
in Willard's Mill?

07:41.182 --> 07:43.285
172.

07:44.918 --> 07:49.923
One person burned 172
people for witchcraft?

07:49.956 --> 07:52.026
One sheriff.

07:54.995 --> 07:57.966
And ever since, every
sheriff we've ever had

07:57.999 --> 08:01.503
has died an early,
violent, horrible death.

08:01.536 --> 08:02.803
Eh.

08:02.836 --> 08:05.206
Except Stan, right?

08:05.238 --> 08:07.108
Except Stan.

08:07.141 --> 08:10.746
I think someone or something
was looking out for him.

08:14.281 --> 08:16.017
Hey.

08:16.050 --> 08:18.119
You know what?

08:18.151 --> 08:20.854
You should enter that pie contest.

08:20.887 --> 08:22.856
Enter it and win.

08:22.889 --> 08:25.127
You got to live life while you can.

08:45.479 --> 08:48.149
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

09:07.301 --> 09:10.104
Didn't I say that when Mommy's
not home, Karen's in charge?

09:10.136 --> 09:11.471
But I don't want a new nanny.

09:11.505 --> 09:12.974
I like Tallon.

09:13.006 --> 09:15.042
I-I like Tallon, too.

09:15.076 --> 09:17.144
Sheriff.

09:17.178 --> 09:19.246
You've got a visitor.

09:22.250 --> 09:25.519
Uh, you know, Mommy's gonna have
to call you back, sweetheart.

09:48.742 --> 09:51.924
Claire Miller, what the
hell were you up to?

09:52.194 --> 09:53.862
And one and two and...

09:53.863 --> 09:57.134
Did, uh... did you ever see
your mother with this book?

09:57.485 --> 09:59.354
- Yeah, all the time.
- down and...

09:59.386 --> 10:01.254
Really? How come I didn't?

10:01.288 --> 10:02.456
'Cause you were never
home, and when you were,

10:02.490 --> 10:04.524
you just sat in your chair
and you didn't pay no attention.

10:04.557 --> 10:06.027
Of course I don't pay no attention,

10:06.059 --> 10:07.628
you two sitting around all day,

10:07.662 --> 10:10.365
chirping away like two birds
fighting over an onion ring.

10:10.398 --> 10:11.331
Give me a break.

10:11.365 --> 10:13.268
What... What is this thing?

10:13.301 --> 10:14.302
It's Mom's necklace book.

10:14.336 --> 10:16.537
You know Mom's necklace
with the glass thingy?

10:16.570 --> 10:17.972
She used to put it on the page,

10:18.005 --> 10:19.439
and she'd read the words
through the glass.

10:19.472 --> 10:21.508
She did it all the time
before she went out.

10:21.542 --> 10:23.444
- Before she went out?
- Yeah.

10:23.476 --> 10:25.245
She'd go out after you went to bed.

10:25.279 --> 10:27.115
- Doing what?
- I don't know.

10:27.148 --> 10:28.449
Where is this necklace now?

10:28.481 --> 10:29.482
Well, she liked it so much,

10:29.516 --> 10:31.451
I put it on her, you know,
down in the... pbht.

10:31.485 --> 10:34.154
- The grave?
- Yeah.

10:34.187 --> 10:36.124
That's just terrific work.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.692
- One and two.
- Broke the mold.

10:37.725 --> 10:40.061
- Good job. Okay.
- Judy, I like your buns.

10:40.094 --> 10:42.263
I'm gonna get those buns.

10:42.296 --> 10:43.431
Hello.

10:43.463 --> 10:44.698
I'm Evie Barret.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.567
How can I help you?

10:46.600 --> 10:48.101
I just thought I'd stop by

10:48.134 --> 10:51.038
and meet the new constable.

10:51.072 --> 10:54.509
The last one wasn't
very nice to me, you know.

10:55.710 --> 10:59.013
Are you the woman from the funeral?

10:59.046 --> 11:01.115
Is that your daughter?

11:02.322 --> 11:04.991
She's lovely.

11:05.060 --> 11:06.062
Uh, thank you.

11:06.287 --> 11:08.098
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

11:14.626 --> 11:17.194
Aah!

11:17.227 --> 11:18.763
There's no meddling old biddy

11:18.796 --> 11:23.234
to protect you or him anymore!

11:23.267 --> 11:27.304
Bring me her seeing stone!

11:27.338 --> 11:32.711
Bring me her seeing stone!!

11:43.588 --> 11:44.689
Mm.

11:50.428 --> 11:51.529
Now what?

11:51.530 --> 11:54.911
All I want to do is nothing,
and I can't even do that.

11:54.912 --> 11:55.895
For the love of God.

11:55.967 --> 11:57.669
I think it's the TV.

12:02.807 --> 12:04.309
For the love of God.

12:10.831 --> 12:11.966
There you go.

12:11.976 --> 12:13.779
- Surprise!
- Aah!

12:26.206 --> 12:28.109
Sheriff Miller?

12:28.142 --> 12:30.177
You know that, uh,
woman from the funeral

12:30.211 --> 12:31.178
that you beat up?

12:31.211 --> 12:34.415
I think she attacked me
in my office today.

12:35.283 --> 12:37.185
Oh, I-I-I see.

12:37.217 --> 12:40.354
Now it's... Now it's your office?

12:41.989 --> 12:43.090
I have to tell you...
that... that... that...

12:43.124 --> 12:44.860
that was... that was pretty quick.

12:44.893 --> 12:47.928
What I'm saying is... I think that we...

12:47.961 --> 12:49.129
I think we're cursed.

12:49.162 --> 12:51.198
Well, don't crap an apple.

12:51.231 --> 12:54.468
I will take care of it.

12:54.502 --> 12:55.336
When?

12:55.369 --> 12:57.304
Uh... in a minute.

12:57.337 --> 12:58.906
I mean, now is a good time.

12:58.940 --> 12:59.741
Oh, dear God.

12:59.773 --> 13:02.110
One day in charge, and look at you.

13:02.143 --> 13:03.928
Mrs. Do This, Do That.

13:03.929 --> 13:06.866
Has it even occurred
to you to ask me why

13:06.899 --> 13:11.638
I'm laying facedown in my yard,
holding two bags of skin?

13:11.670 --> 13:13.605
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:13.639 --> 13:17.228
Of course... Of course
it hasn't, because...

13:17.229 --> 13:19.165
it's all about you, isn't it?

13:19.312 --> 13:23.079
Well, I have a... I have
a gangbuster suggestion for you.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.717
Here... Here's a souvenir
for a happy fan.

13:24.749 --> 13:25.629
What? What is...

13:25.630 --> 13:28.532
Why don't you just go
home, make a salad,

13:28.566 --> 13:30.134
have some wine, get your period,

13:30.168 --> 13:31.503
call your mother, just go nuts,

13:31.535 --> 13:34.338
do whatever it is that
you people seem to do,

13:34.371 --> 13:37.409
and let me take care of it.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.378
No, you can't come over.

13:39.410 --> 13:41.679
I'm babysitting the new
sheriff's daughter.

13:44.481 --> 13:45.985
Hold on.

13:50.221 --> 13:52.490
You must be Karen.

13:52.524 --> 13:55.394
I'm Grace's grandmother.

13:55.427 --> 13:57.329
May I come in?

14:21.795 --> 14:23.731
What are you doing?

14:23.732 --> 14:25.233
What does it look like I'm doing?

14:25.434 --> 14:26.844
I'm digging up my wife.

14:26.995 --> 14:28.597
May I ask why?

14:28.598 --> 14:29.635
Oh, no reason.

14:29.669 --> 14:34.174
All right, look, Stan,
if... if this is real,

14:35.358 --> 14:36.793
then we're gonna have to work together.

14:36.827 --> 14:38.525
No, we're not.

14:38.526 --> 14:41.396
Sheriff Miller, if you don't tell me

14:41.429 --> 14:44.900
why you weren't killed in office...

14:44.933 --> 14:47.535
I might kill you now that you're out.

14:52.908 --> 14:54.443
Oh, my God.

14:59.548 --> 15:01.884
So, your wife was keeping you alive.

15:01.916 --> 15:03.051
Well, it's like I said...

15:03.084 --> 15:06.921
I-I haven't been in here
since that gay cop show was on.

15:06.954 --> 15:09.590
- What gay cop show?
- "Starsky & Hutch."

15:09.624 --> 15:11.505
Starsky and Hutch weren't gay.

15:12.638 --> 15:14.171
Guy's sweater had a belt.

15:14.227 --> 15:14.962
Give me a break.

15:14.963 --> 15:17.331
You're a cop. Read the signs, would you?

15:17.365 --> 15:18.403
Stan, look at this.

15:18.403 --> 15:19.404
No!

15:19.437 --> 15:22.248
Not until you say Starsky
and Hutch were gay.

15:22.305 --> 15:23.206
Just come here, would you?

15:23.241 --> 15:25.877
I think this is the...
like, the town ledger

15:25.910 --> 15:27.411
that's documenting Constable Eccles

15:27.444 --> 15:29.814
and... and all the witch burnings.

15:29.847 --> 15:32.684
- Isn't this the woman from the funeral?
- Yeah.

15:32.717 --> 15:34.185
Her name was, uh...

15:34.218 --> 15:35.853
yeah, Stella Stanas.

15:35.886 --> 15:37.354
It says her last words

15:37.387 --> 15:38.956
before she was burned alive on the stake

15:38.989 --> 15:42.326
was a-a-a curse on all future constables

15:42.359 --> 15:43.661
of Willard's Mill.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.396
Get a load of this shit.

15:45.430 --> 15:46.698
This is written in some kind of

15:46.731 --> 15:49.067
ass-backwards Mexican cha-cha talk.

15:49.099 --> 15:50.935
Supposedly, Claire's necklace

15:50.968 --> 15:52.237
helped you read all this baloney.

15:52.269 --> 15:55.239
Oh! Where is it?

15:55.805 --> 15:58.741
Oh, now, it's funny you'd mention that.

15:58.775 --> 16:01.345
You want to take your best guess

16:01.378 --> 16:03.380
at just exactly what I was trying to get

16:03.414 --> 16:06.018
when you threatened to kill me?

16:07.785 --> 16:08.920
Why didn't you say something?

16:08.953 --> 16:11.956
Just to prove you don't have
any idea what you're doing.

16:12.297 --> 16:15.072
You women... you always got to be right.

16:15.073 --> 16:17.108
"I got to be right.
It's important I'm right.

16:17.141 --> 16:19.457
I got to be right this week,
next week, all month, this ..."

16:19.457 --> 16:24.529
You risked both of our lives
just to tell me I was wrong?

16:24.800 --> 16:27.203
Personal foul. You just did it again.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.434
- Wh...
- I asked you a question.

16:28.435 --> 16:31.201
You answered my question
with a question. You were wrong.

16:31.202 --> 16:32.671
Try it on for size.
See... See if you can say it.

16:32.703 --> 16:33.938
- This is unbelievable.
- "I was wrong."

16:33.972 --> 16:35.241
And for the Daily Double,

16:35.274 --> 16:37.376
include, "Starsky and Hutch were gay."

16:37.409 --> 16:38.878
- Well...
- Go ahead, give... give that a try.

16:38.910 --> 16:41.380
You can't even do it.

16:41.413 --> 16:43.249
You can't. You can't.

16:43.281 --> 16:45.283
We are gonna go back to the cemetery

16:45.317 --> 16:47.319
and dig up your dead wife.

16:47.352 --> 16:49.222
Yeah.

16:49.788 --> 16:52.125
Soon as I call my sitter.

17:07.598 --> 17:08.601
Grace!

17:08.698 --> 17:10.767
Oh, Jesus!

17:12.010 --> 17:13.011
Karen!

17:13.044 --> 17:14.713
Don't be mad.

17:14.747 --> 17:16.449
Grace's grandmother
came over to get her,

17:16.482 --> 17:18.415
but Grace said she
didn't know who she was,

17:18.450 --> 17:19.785
so I tried to stop it.

17:19.818 --> 17:21.185
Karen, w-where is Grace?

17:21.220 --> 17:22.303
Hey.

17:22.304 --> 17:24.307
If I'm dead, I shouldn't
be talking, right?

17:24.340 --> 17:26.655
Karen, where is my daughter?!

17:26.656 --> 17:29.159
I know!

17:37.760 --> 17:40.096
What if I don't need
no book or spell, huh?

17:40.129 --> 17:42.832
What if I just hit her
over the head with a pipe?

17:42.866 --> 17:45.035
Or a series of pipes.

17:56.980 --> 17:59.116
Oh, for the love of God.

18:00.616 --> 18:02.085
Stan, help me!

18:02.117 --> 18:04.387
Evie, why'd you do that?

18:04.421 --> 18:05.522
I didn't.

18:05.555 --> 18:08.558
This is the gravesite of all
those people who got burned.

18:08.590 --> 18:09.792
And Stella's got Grace.

18:09.826 --> 18:12.062
She's gonna burn me alive.

18:12.796 --> 18:15.030
28 years.

18:15.064 --> 18:18.168
I was the sheriff for 28 years.

18:18.201 --> 18:20.103
Never got tied to a stake.

18:20.135 --> 18:22.038
You're here exactly one week...

18:22.070 --> 18:24.006
Could you just untie me, please?

18:24.038 --> 18:25.874
One week.

18:28.676 --> 18:30.178
Geez, lady!

18:30.211 --> 18:31.446
Anybody ever tell you

18:31.480 --> 18:33.182
you look like a barrel of assholes?

18:36.552 --> 18:37.854
Grace!

18:39.689 --> 18:41.992
Grace!

18:49.731 --> 18:51.768
Stella Stanas!

18:51.800 --> 18:52.935
Uh, using my authority

18:52.969 --> 18:55.939
as the current constable
of the Willard's Mill township,

18:55.971 --> 18:59.231
I hereby pardon you of
the false charge of witchcraft.

19:01.691 --> 19:03.031
Pipe to the head.

19:04.333 --> 19:05.668
Never fails.

19:05.676 --> 19:07.044
Not that I've ever...

19:07.078 --> 19:09.647
done that to a suspect.

19:09.681 --> 19:12.717
That would, of course, be...

19:12.750 --> 19:14.051
illegal.

19:14.085 --> 19:16.554
- Mommy.
- It's okay, sweetie.

19:16.882 --> 19:17.682
Mommy's here.

19:17.716 --> 19:19.052
You know, I always hated this thing.

19:19.085 --> 19:20.053
It looks like that crap you get

19:20.085 --> 19:22.220
at those Renaissance fairs
over towards Vermont.

19:22.254 --> 19:23.856
You ever... You ever go to those things?

19:23.889 --> 19:25.858
They are for shit.

19:25.891 --> 19:28.127
But they got themselves a turkey leg.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.162
Oh, doctor!

19:31.730 --> 19:33.799
Un-Un-Untie you. Right.

19:33.833 --> 19:35.368
Right. There we go.

19:35.401 --> 19:36.268
Thanks.

19:36.302 --> 19:38.638
- There you go.
- Okay.

19:40.105 --> 19:41.673
28 years.

19:41.707 --> 19:42.874
Oh, God, sweetie.

19:42.908 --> 19:44.711
Okay. All right.

19:44.744 --> 19:46.713
I need you to go hide behind
that tree... okay?...

19:46.746 --> 19:48.781
and don't come out
until I say it's safe.

19:48.814 --> 19:51.151
Okay? Can you do that? All right.

19:54.754 --> 19:55.688
I can't read this thing.

19:55.720 --> 19:56.855
I didn't bring my glasses.

19:56.889 --> 19:58.625
Well, here.

19:58.658 --> 19:59.593
Uh... all right.

19:59.625 --> 20:02.828
Okay, it says we need
to encircle her in salt.

20:02.862 --> 20:04.931
Shit. We don't have salt.

20:04.963 --> 20:07.833
The hell we don't.

20:07.866 --> 20:08.741
Wha...

20:09.941 --> 20:12.955
Uh, you're... you're gonna judge me
because I steal condiments?

20:23.048 --> 20:25.684
"In the name of the great lady
I hunt by sea,

20:25.718 --> 20:27.253
by flower, by fruit of evil ..."

20:27.286 --> 20:29.989
Again, like those
Renaissance fairs in Vermont

20:30.021 --> 20:31.990
but... boy, oh, boy...
that's good eatin'.

20:32.024 --> 20:33.126
Aah!

20:38.396 --> 20:40.200
Aah!

20:46.488 --> 20:48.390
Ugh.

20:48.774 --> 20:49.606
Come on, you.

20:51.786 --> 20:52.533
Let's go.

20:52.557 --> 20:54.211
Come on, you son of a...

20:54.212 --> 20:55.714
- <i>Creature of night</i>...
- Come on, you son of a...

20:55.748 --> 20:57.016
You want some of that medicine?

20:57.049 --> 20:58.917
- <i>Let the sacred circle bind you</i>.
- How do you like this?

20:58.950 --> 21:00.185
<i>Great mother of three times three,</i>

21:00.219 --> 21:02.388
<i>I cast thy magic upon you</i>

21:02.934 --> 21:05.666
<i>a-and banish thee from the
realm of the mortals!</i>

21:17.648 --> 21:20.981
So... according to that book...

21:22.102 --> 21:23.304
we're still cursed.

21:23.336 --> 21:26.873
There's 171 other demons who...

21:28.059 --> 21:29.686
are determined to carry it out.

21:30.179 --> 21:32.548
Eh. I wouldn't worry about it.
