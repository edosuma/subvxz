WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.837
I am so excited for book club!

00:04.839 --> 00:06.972
Oh, I've been looking forward
to this for weeks.

00:06.974 --> 00:08.607
Oh, me too.

00:08.609 --> 00:09.975
I haven't seen you in forever.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.176
I had to go through your mail

00:11.178 --> 00:12.818
to see what's going on with you.

00:13.547 --> 00:14.947
That was a joke.

00:14.949 --> 00:16.882
I hope so,
because I'm missing a<i> Redbook.</i>

00:16.884 --> 00:18.317
My mother-in-law's birthday
is coming up,

00:18.319 --> 00:19.885
and I need
those perfume samples.

00:19.887 --> 00:23.956
So, I was thinking about who
I would haunt if I was a ghost,

00:23.958 --> 00:25.391
and I think...

00:25.393 --> 00:26.959
Ohh,
you ladies having wine club?

00:26.961 --> 00:28.827
I would love some. (Laughs)

00:28.829 --> 00:32.231
Tha... That was my glass.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.199
Oh, uh, we have more of these
bad boys in the kitchen

00:34.201 --> 00:35.868
just to the left of the fridge.

00:35.870 --> 00:38.303
O...kay.

00:38.305 --> 00:40.005
Um...

00:40.007 --> 00:41.507
Can I...

00:41.509 --> 00:42.841
Or not. Okay. Yeah, all right.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.477
Cheers. (Chuckles)

00:46.680 --> 00:48.981
Sorry about last night.

00:48.983 --> 00:50.816
I guess
Louis was feeling chatty.

00:50.818 --> 00:51.683
Oh, I thought his idea for
a wide-mouth gas-pump nozzle

00:51.685 --> 00:54.253
- was interesting.
- (chuckles)

00:54.255 --> 00:56.989
Oh, yesterday you were telling
me about who you would haunt.

00:56.991 --> 00:58.557
(gasps) Yes.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.658
Okay, so, you know
that female traffic cop

00:59.660 --> 01:01.727
that's across the street
from the park?

01:01.729 --> 01:03.262
(door opens)
LOUIS: Knock, knock!

01:03.264 --> 01:05.197
- With the...
- The kids said you were here,

01:05.199 --> 01:07.733
and I thought you might like
some snacks from the restaurant.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.268
Oh!

01:09.270 --> 01:10.502
See this?

01:10.504 --> 01:12.204
This is about half the diameter

01:12.206 --> 01:14.206
of that nozzle we were
talking about last night.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.808
Mmm.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.548
Doesn't it feel a little weird

01:22.550 --> 01:24.349
hiding from your husband
like this?

01:24.351 --> 01:25.717
Here we go.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.786
Louis is great,
but ever since he stopped

01:27.788 --> 01:30.122
staying late
to close the restaurant,

01:30.124 --> 01:31.890
he's just been around
a lot more.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.793
And sometimes
you just want girl time.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.895
Mm-hmm.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.864
So, ghost, haunting, go.

01:38.866 --> 01:42.534
LOUIS: There you are! (Laughs)

01:42.536 --> 01:45.037
Marvin told me
where you two were,

01:45.038 --> 01:47.539
and I felt bad about drinking
all of your wine, so...

01:48.109 --> 01:49.575
Ah. (Laughs)

01:49.577 --> 01:51.643
Sorry, chief. No pocket wine.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.479
How did you get that
past our bouncer?

01:53.481 --> 01:55.247
It wasn't easy.
She's got a meaty frisk.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.882
That's Barb.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.284
If I was a ghost, I would haunt
the female traffic attendant,

01:59.286 --> 02:00.652
which would cause an accident,
creating more ghosts!

02:00.654 --> 02:02.888
Thank you.
That's all I wanted to know.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.128

everywhere I go ¶

02:09.130 --> 02:11.263
¶ If you don't know, homey,
now you know ¶

02:11.265 --> 02:12.731
¶ Fresh off the boat ¶

02:12.733 --> 02:14.800

02:14.802 --> 02:16.468
¶ But I know where I'm goin' ¶

02:16.470 --> 02:18.504
¶ I'm fresh off the boat ¶

02:21.442 --> 02:22.641
Just so we're clear, once again,

02:22.643 --> 02:24.776
what are the closing procedures?

02:24.778 --> 02:27.412
Turn off the ovens,
comb the bear,

02:27.414 --> 02:28.680
and make sure I lock the door
<i>after</i> I leave.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.782
Good. Also, you don't have to
comb the bear.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.519
We'll see.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.625
(sighs)

02:39.627 --> 02:42.361
The one place Louis won't go
after work is work.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.463
(laughs)

02:44.465 --> 02:49.368
Was Louis always so, um,
"present" back in D.C.?

02:49.370 --> 02:51.537
No. If he had any free time,

02:51.539 --> 02:53.505
he'd just shoot pool
with his buddy Hank.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.775
They would hang out and talk
about whatever guys talk about.

02:56.777 --> 02:57.709
For me, the Pomeranian

02:57.711 --> 03:01.180
is the unsung hero
of the toy dog group.

03:01.182 --> 03:04.349
I'm sorry, are we in a pool hall
or a fool hall,

03:04.351 --> 03:06.185
'cause that is ridiculous.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.786
I don't get it.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.788
It seems like Louis
has tons of friends here.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.740
He's friendly
with a lot of people,

03:11.741 --> 03:13.691
but he doesn't have a close
friend to hang out with.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.195
Maybe if Louis gets back into
playing pool,

03:16.197 --> 03:20.132
then he can find someone not us
to hang out with.

03:20.134 --> 03:22.614
Maybe he just needs
a little nudge.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.471
Surprise!

03:26.473 --> 03:27.839
Black Ball Becky!

03:27.841 --> 03:29.241
Got her out of the garage.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.542
Had her re-tipped for you.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.412
(whistles) Look at that nub.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.813
Is that a bo staff?

03:34.815 --> 03:37.382
No, son. This is
a different kind of weapon.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.886
A two-piece, low-deflection,
maple-shaft pool cue.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.855
Remember how much fun you
used to have playing with Hank?

03:43.857 --> 03:46.458
- Oh, we did have fun.
- Yeah.

03:46.459 --> 03:49.060
You know, they used to call me
"Louie Short Pockets."

03:49.063 --> 03:50.729
Because you were poor?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.731
No. Because I was accurate.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.533
You should get back out there.

03:54.535 --> 03:55.867
Oh, I can't.
I'm too busy with work.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.869
Oh, the restaurant
is doing fine on its own.

03:57.871 --> 04:01.240
And you seem to have
more free time.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.708
I don't have anyone
to play with.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.276
Just go down to the pool hall.

04:04.278 --> 04:05.877
I'm sure
you'll meet somebody there.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.546
Where? I don't even...

04:07.548 --> 04:09.047
There's Rack n' Roll on Orange,
Cue-Tips on Third,

04:09.049 --> 04:10.682
and downtown there's
Stars and Stripes and Solids,

04:10.684 --> 04:14.953
though the ad in the phone book
said "no foreigners,"

04:14.955 --> 04:16.855
so maybe not that one.

04:16.857 --> 04:17.856
Oh, and there's turn-by-turn
directions on the back.

04:17.858 --> 04:18.857
Oh.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.526
(chuckles)

04:21.528 --> 04:22.761
(school bell rings)

04:24.898 --> 04:27.399
All the ladies in here
are fully clothed.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.301
Hey, you see Whitney
in your mailbox,

04:29.303 --> 04:30.702
you grab her and go.

04:30.704 --> 04:31.937
I get it.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.472
She's like
your Mario Van Peebles.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.640
I got to go.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.074
Bye.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.909
You guys hear the news?

04:37.911 --> 04:41.480
Nicole and Hot Chris broke up.

04:42.549 --> 04:43.749
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.084
Schwarzenegger?

04:46.086 --> 04:48.086
I've heard that impression
before.

04:48.087 --> 04:50.087
No. <i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.250
Like, for eva.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.761
Oh, daaamn!

04:55.763 --> 04:59.298
That's how he broke up with her?

04:59.300 --> 05:01.633
"T-2"? That's cold.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.771
So, Eddie, is it cool
if I take a run at Nicole?

05:05.773 --> 05:08.173
What? Why are you asking me?

05:08.175 --> 05:09.508
Well, you used to
have a crush on her,

05:09.510 --> 05:10.593
and I wouldn't
want it to be weird.

05:10.594 --> 05:11.677
Yeah, <i>that's</i> why it'd be weird.

05:11.679 --> 05:15.681
Take your dark cloud
somewhere else, Brian!

05:15.683 --> 05:18.350
Hey, man, you do your thing.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.751
Me and Nicole
are just friends now.

05:19.753 --> 05:20.819
Nicole: Hey.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.821
You want these Jerky Boys CDs?

05:22.823 --> 05:25.190
They were dumb-ass Chris'.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.491
Sorry you guys broke up.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.460
Yeah. Sorry.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.362
It's fine.
My dad said he liked him,

05:30.364 --> 05:32.097
so I was starting
to lose interest.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.298
You want to sit with us?

05:33.300 --> 05:35.033
Yeah. Sit.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.769
Nah. I'm gonna take a "half
day," if you know what I mean.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.771
Yeah. Like half a full day.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.941
Maybe we can grab some ice cream
later this week?

05:42.943 --> 05:44.609
- That'd be nice.
- Yes!

05:44.611 --> 05:45.891
Not you, pumpkin head.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.549
The dance begins.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.883
(rock music playing)

06:05.566 --> 06:09.034
"Stay out as late
as you ca... want.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.236
Jessica.
P.S. We're out of eggs."

06:11.238 --> 06:14.272
¶¶

06:16.810 --> 06:18.643
Hey.

06:18.645 --> 06:19.678
You lookin' for a game?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.346
Yeah.

06:21.348 --> 06:22.497
Hey, Tony!

06:22.498 --> 06:23.647
Fresh meat!

06:23.650 --> 06:25.517
They call me Louie Short Pock...

06:25.519 --> 06:26.651
You win a game,
then you can tell me your name.

06:26.653 --> 06:29.087
Can I tell you her name?

06:29.089 --> 06:31.289
No. It's Black Ball Becky.
Okay, rack 'em up!

06:31.692 --> 06:35.026
(video game music plays)

06:35.028 --> 06:37.662
So, I was thinking about you
getting ice cream with Nicole.

06:37.664 --> 06:40.432
Won't Alison be mad?

06:40.434 --> 06:41.500
Why would she be?

06:41.502 --> 06:43.268
'Cause Nicole's single now.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.103
Chicks can't have their men
hanging out with single chicks.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.505
I saw that on "Maury Povich."

06:46.507 --> 06:47.906
Alison wouldn't care.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.741
She was fine
with Whitney Houston.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.575
First of all,
Whitney's unattainable.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.278
She's married to Bobby Brown.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.515
Second, you used to
have a hard crush on Nicole.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.682
Alison doesn't know about that.

06:57.684 --> 07:00.285
And pause.

07:00.287 --> 07:02.521
You never told Alison
about Nicole?

07:02.523 --> 07:03.622
No.

07:03.623 --> 07:04.722
It just...

07:04.725 --> 07:06.792
I don't know.
It... It didn't come up.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.094
It didn't... come... up.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.629
(sighs)

07:10.631 --> 07:12.697
Well, you better hope
she doesn't... Unpause!

07:12.699 --> 07:14.266
You're playing cheap, dude!

07:14.268 --> 07:17.269
Cheap as the toilet paper
in your house.

07:17.271 --> 07:20.205
For me, it's Denzel in "Glory."

07:20.207 --> 07:22.407
I like a man with a musket.

07:22.409 --> 07:25.243
Gene Hackman in "Hoosiers."

07:25.245 --> 07:26.945
Mm. What can I say?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.780
I like 'em old and cranky
with a checkered past.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.584
Oh, hey! How was the pool hall?

07:32.586 --> 07:33.985
Great!

07:33.987 --> 07:35.787
Cheap beer, nonstop Thorogood
on the jukebox,

07:35.789 --> 07:39.157
the smell of Camel Lights
and desperation!

07:39.159 --> 07:40.158
You were smoking?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.993
No, but I was smoked on.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.378
It was great!

07:43.379 --> 07:44.762
Me and Tony held the table
for nine straight games.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.332
No one
wanted to play us anymore,

07:47.334 --> 07:48.817
so we're gonna
hit a new pool hall.

07:48.818 --> 07:50.301
Figured I'd drop off the eggs.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.770
I also picked us up

07:51.772 --> 07:54.139
an "Archie Digest"
for the bathroom.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.408
Jughead starts a business.
(chuckles)

07:56.410 --> 07:58.176
Okay, bye. Don't wait up!

07:58.178 --> 07:59.911
Hey, we won't.
You boys have fun!

07:59.913 --> 08:02.113
Boys? No, Tony's a woman.

08:02.115 --> 08:05.750
(door opens, closes)

08:05.752 --> 08:10.188
It... Ah, oh,
I'm just gonna top you off here.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.924
(inhales) There we go.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.831
Louis is hanging out
with another woman?!

08:19.833 --> 08:22.267
You're overreacting. It's fine.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.946
(door closes)

08:34.948 --> 08:37.716
It is inappropriate for an adult

08:37.718 --> 08:39.985
to have a friend
of the opposite sex.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.686
My parents never had that.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.655
Can you imagine my mom saying,

08:43.657 --> 08:45.724
"Travis and I
are going to the movies"?

08:45.726 --> 08:47.726
- Who's Travis?
- There is no Travis.

08:47.728 --> 08:52.163
- That's the point!
- Jessica, it's the '90s.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.366
It's normal to have friends
of the opposite sex.

08:54.368 --> 08:58.570
In... In fact, Marvin and I were
friends for months before...

08:58.572 --> 09:00.705
We got to see this bitch.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.975
(school bell rings)

09:03.977 --> 09:06.378
(children shouting)

09:06.380 --> 09:08.346
I don't get it.
Why don't you just tell Alison

09:08.348 --> 09:09.714
that you used to
have a crush on Nicole?

09:09.716 --> 09:11.683
It's too late.
I should've told her before.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.419
Now it's gonna seem like
I'm hiding something.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.887
What if they
run into each other?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.722
Nicole's in the 8th grade.
That's a different hallway.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.225
Yeah, what about the cafeteria?

09:20.227 --> 09:21.810
Or the tetherball court?

09:21.811 --> 09:23.394
And let's not forget
a little place called

09:23.397 --> 09:24.796
the girls' bathroom.

09:24.797 --> 09:26.196
I heard
there's a couch in there.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.333
What am I gonna do?!

09:28.335 --> 09:30.702
Eddie, look,
all we got to do is...

09:30.704 --> 09:33.064
We gotta keep 'em separated.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.875
You know, like the song?

09:36.877 --> 09:39.444
Huge song.

09:39.446 --> 09:40.879
Millions sold.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.949
(Alannah Myles' "Black Velvet"
playing)

09:47.454 --> 09:48.954
There she is.

09:52.693 --> 09:57.696
¶ Mississippi in the middle
of a dry spell ¶

09:57.698 --> 10:03.435
¶ Jimmy Rogers
on the Victrola up high ¶

10:03.437 --> 10:07.639
¶ Mama's dancin'
with baby on her shoulder ¶

10:07.641 --> 10:11.309
¶¶

10:14.715 --> 10:19.250
¶ The boy could sing,
knew how to move, everything ¶

10:19.252 --> 10:22.153
Okay, so, she may be attractive,

10:22.155 --> 10:26.124
but everything is sexy
to this song.

10:26.126 --> 10:31.096
¶ Black velvet
and that little boy's smile ¶

10:31.098 --> 10:36.067
¶ Black velvet
with that slow Southern style ¶

10:36.069 --> 10:41.072
¶ A new religion
that'll bring ya to your knees ¶

10:41.074 --> 10:43.908
See what I mean...

10:43.910 --> 10:45.477
Hey, Short Pockets.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.112
Hey, Jessica.
What are you doing here?

10:47.114 --> 10:49.114
This must be Tony. Why did
your parents name you that?

10:49.116 --> 10:51.516
That's a man's name.
It's very misleading.

10:51.518 --> 10:54.285
- It's short for Antonia.
- How convenient.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.354
You must be Jessica,
Louis' wife.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.073
He's told me so much about you.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.791
Oh, really?
Did he mention my gender?

10:59.793 --> 11:01.826
Do you just hang around
pool halls hoping to meet men?

11:01.828 --> 11:04.429
No, I just love playing pool,

11:04.431 --> 11:06.164
and most people who play
are men.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.166
It's more like I hang around men
trying to pick up pool halls.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.101
- (laughs)
- (chuckles)

11:10.103 --> 11:12.270
You have no power here, witch.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.304
Excuse me?

11:13.306 --> 11:14.706
You heard me, demon.

11:16.610 --> 11:17.776
Come on, Louis. Let's go.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.511
Uh, Jessica,
we're in the middle of a game.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.980
If we win, we get
a free basket of chicken wings,

11:21.982 --> 11:25.417
and I made a big show out of
pre-ordering extra ranch.

11:26.620 --> 11:27.786
Oh, it's an emergency.

11:27.788 --> 11:31.322
Mitch locked himself
in the restaurant again.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.691
What? Ugh!

11:32.692 --> 11:34.059
Of course he did.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.560
Oh, I'm a locksmith.

11:35.562 --> 11:36.561
Is there something
I could do to help?

11:36.563 --> 11:38.396
No. Uh, thank you.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.798
We don't need it.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.232
Okay.

11:45.806 --> 11:46.805
Whew, that was tough.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.206
But it worked.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.974
We kept Alison and Nicole apart
all day.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.810
I thought they were gonna talk
in the lunch line.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.012
But luckily Trent stepped in
with a distraction.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.981
That's the great thing
about this baby.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.750
I can turn it on and off
at will.

11:58.752 --> 12:01.352
"Trent, it's time for church!"

12:01.354 --> 12:03.021
Oh, yeah?

12:03.023 --> 12:04.656
Thanks for your help, guys.

12:04.658 --> 12:07.258
Now we just need to keep it up
until Nicole graduates.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.426
Hopefully.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.096
Don't wipe off the rouge yet,
boys.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.498
Looks like
we've got a second show.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.935
- What?
- They're talking right outside.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.273
Oh, no. They're about to fight!

12:22.275 --> 12:23.875
Alison: Get out of here!

12:23.877 --> 12:26.077
No, seriously,
they were only seven bucks

12:26.079 --> 12:27.946
at Claire's Boutique.
Go ahead and borrow them.

12:27.948 --> 12:30.715
Really? Okay, then here,
I have to return the favor.

12:30.717 --> 12:33.284
Thank you.
I'm so excited to wear them.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.787
What's happening?
Walter, narrate!

12:37.924 --> 12:39.641
So, long story short,

12:39.642 --> 12:41.359
you can't make raisin bread
in the microwave.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.827
Uh-huh.

12:42.828 --> 12:44.294
So, I was hanging
by the buses today

12:44.297 --> 12:46.264
and I saw you
talking with Nicole.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.767
Oh. Yeah, we met on the couch
in the bathroom.

12:48.769 --> 12:52.203
She said she liked my backpack,
and we started talking.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.872
So, uh, no big surprises
or anything?

12:53.874 --> 12:55.874
Um... no big reveals?

12:55.876 --> 12:58.777
No, nothing like that.
She was just really cool.

12:58.779 --> 13:01.946
I totally get
why you had a crush on her.

13:02.649 --> 13:03.648
Whaaaat?

13:03.650 --> 13:06.818
It's cool. She's badass!

13:06.820 --> 13:08.753
Wait, so you're not mad?

13:08.755 --> 13:10.722
Fart no! You and I are good.

13:10.724 --> 13:13.591
Besides, that was before
we even knew each other.

13:13.593 --> 13:14.893
We don't care about old crushes.

13:14.895 --> 13:15.727
(sighs) Of course we don't!

13:15.729 --> 13:18.263
That's what I'm sayin'.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.331
It's like how you don't care
about my old crush on Dave.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.734
Dave who?

13:22.736 --> 13:25.136
Dave. Your best friend Dave?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.305
I saw him feeding a squirrel
once and thought it was cute.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.941
Alison's dad:
Alison! Chili bar's ready!

13:29.943 --> 13:31.776
You better get those chives
before your brother dives in!

13:31.778 --> 13:33.278
Oh, man, I got to go.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.512
I'll talk to you tomorrow!

13:34.514 --> 13:36.815
(dial tone)

13:38.752 --> 13:41.352
I checked all of
Mitch's hiding spots.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.138
He's nowhere.

13:43.139 --> 13:44.923
Although he obviously
combed the bear.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.358
He left a pick in its haunches.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.829
Okay, I lied about Mitch to
get you out of that pool hall.

13:50.831 --> 13:54.966
What? You're the one who told me
to go there in the first place!

13:54.968 --> 13:56.768
Yes, because I thought you were
going to meet a<i> guy</i> friend!

13:56.770 --> 14:00.338
So I can't be friends
with a woman?

14:00.340 --> 14:02.507
That's ridiculous.
I'm around women all day here.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.142
That's different.

14:04.143 --> 14:05.776
That's during the day, at work.

14:05.779 --> 14:09.314
So I can never be around a woman
outside of work?

14:09.316 --> 14:11.115
That's not what I'm saying.

14:11.117 --> 14:12.717
That would be crazy.

14:12.719 --> 14:16.120
All I am saying is if you're
going to hang out with a woman,

14:16.122 --> 14:18.690
it has to be when the sun is up.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.892
And she can't be taller than me.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.827
Or younger than me.
Or weigh less than me.

14:22.829 --> 14:25.029
Or look like
she weighs less than me.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.698
Also, you can't share food.

14:26.700 --> 14:32.036
Okay, I guess if you're stranded
and you have to share food,

14:32.038 --> 14:34.706
then clear soups or broths only.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.542
And you will display
your wedding band

14:37.544 --> 14:40.245
close to your face at all times.

14:40.247 --> 14:43.815
Photos of your children
must be present

14:43.817 --> 14:46.985
if they themselves cannot be.

14:46.987 --> 14:50.321
If she happens to touch you,
even if by accident,

14:50.323 --> 14:53.858
you will excuse yourself
and call me immediately.

14:53.860 --> 14:57.862
If she has smoky eye makeup,
that is bad.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.931
If she has a lazy eye,
that's good.

14:59.933 --> 15:03.668
Jessica... You must always
travel in separate vehicles.

15:03.670 --> 15:07.672
Going back, lazy eye is out.
It encourages eye contact.

15:07.674 --> 15:11.409
And she must never
have ever been

15:11.411 --> 15:14.212
or even wanted to be a gymnast.

15:14.214 --> 15:17.115
Oh, and this goes without
saying, but no Denzel movies.

15:17.117 --> 15:21.386
I have no interest in Tony
other than playing pool.

15:21.388 --> 15:25.089
That's how it starts, though,
that connection.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.191
I've fallen asleep
during enough Meg Ryan movies.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.543
So what do you
want me to do, then?

15:28.544 --> 15:29.894
You want me to give up pool?
Is that it?

15:29.896 --> 15:32.196
I want you to get
a different partner.

15:32.198 --> 15:34.065
Who do you suggest?

15:34.067 --> 15:36.601
(ZZ Top's "La Grange" playing)

15:36.603 --> 15:38.803
¶ I'm ready for that ¶

15:41.641 --> 15:44.108
¶ A-haw, haw, haw, haw ¶

15:44.110 --> 15:46.311
¶ A-haw, haw, haw, haw ¶

15:46.313 --> 15:48.880
¶ Well, I hear it's fine ¶

15:48.882 --> 15:49.781
¶ If you've got... ¶

15:49.783 --> 15:50.982
Need to see I.D.

15:50.984 --> 15:53.084
Oh, sure. It's just in my purse.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.720
¶ Well, I hear it's fine ¶

15:55.722 --> 15:59.090
¶ If you've got the time ¶

15:59.092 --> 16:04.162
¶ And the ten
to get yourself in ¶

16:04.164 --> 16:05.863
¶ Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm ¶

16:11.071 --> 16:12.570
What do I do?

16:12.572 --> 16:15.673
Just lean in
and aim for the white ball.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.743
¶¶

16:19.813 --> 16:21.579
Oh!

16:21.581 --> 16:24.015
I can't move
in these leather pants.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.683
It's like two snakes
are eating my legs.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.086
Well, at least you had me
run out to the car

16:28.088 --> 16:30.655
and get your emergency Keds
from the trunk.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.358
No spare tire,
but eight pairs of Keds.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.427
Rematch!

16:36.429 --> 16:37.795
No. We have to wait
to play again.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.832
There are four stacks of
quarters ahead of us, so...

16:40.834 --> 16:42.800
Hey, who took my quarters?

16:42.802 --> 16:44.836
I thought
they were for the jukebox.

16:44.838 --> 16:45.937
(Amy Grant's "Baby, Baby"
playing)

16:45.939 --> 16:46.771
Hey, who put this crap on?

16:46.773 --> 16:49.040
He'll come around.

16:49.042 --> 16:51.342
Amy Grant
works from the inside out.

16:51.344 --> 16:55.446
¶ To love you
with the sweetest devotion ¶

16:59.219 --> 17:01.452
What do you guys know
about Dave?

17:01.454 --> 17:02.653
What do you mean?
We hang out with him every day.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.789
No, I mean,
what do we really know?

17:04.791 --> 17:06.991
Can we trust him?

17:06.993 --> 17:09.193
He fed my cat for a week
when we went skiing.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.629
Like that deadbeat-dad angle
he always plays up...

17:11.631 --> 17:12.663
How do we know it's even real?

17:12.665 --> 17:14.545
Anyone can cry on Father's Day.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.171
Trent, you better
pick up my homework,

17:20.173 --> 17:22.093
'cause
I'm about to get suspended.

17:23.877 --> 17:24.876
Hey. Am I interrupting?

17:24.878 --> 17:26.711
I was just telling Alison
about how...

17:26.713 --> 17:30.248
You had that thing for Jasmine
from "Aladdin"?

17:30.250 --> 17:31.883
Hey, I told you that in private!

17:31.885 --> 17:33.518
I just think she's symmetrical.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.719
You know, I don't think
this is a good idea,

17:34.721 --> 17:36.654
you two hanging out.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.689
- Why not?
- Eddie.

17:38.691 --> 17:39.657
Fun fact, Alison...
That squirrel you saw Dave pet?

17:39.659 --> 17:41.893
It actually bit him,

17:41.895 --> 17:43.661
and he's been trying
to trap it ever since.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.963
That's what this whole thing is.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.367
Too bad you didn't make
a Dad trap, huh, Dave?

17:49.369 --> 17:52.437
Now who's playing cheap, man?

17:55.075 --> 17:56.941
That was really mean, Eddie.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.177
Dave didn't do anything to you.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.459
He's your best friend.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.049
Hey, Eddie, are we still on
for ice cream tomorrow?

18:05.051 --> 18:06.451
Um...

18:06.453 --> 18:08.853
You freaked out about Dave,

18:08.855 --> 18:10.755
but it's okay
for you guys to hang out?

18:10.757 --> 18:13.925
Hey, Nicole, cute sweater.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.960
Thanks, girl.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.867
Ned, what are you doing here?

18:22.869 --> 18:24.235
I stay here.

18:24.237 --> 18:27.405
Ned knows drama.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.574
¶ Baby, baby, I'm taken... ¶

18:29.576 --> 18:31.576
How many times
did you play this song?

18:31.578 --> 18:32.944
They love it
at the Denim Turtle.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.096
Listen, why don't we just go?

18:35.097 --> 18:37.247
No, you want to play pool,
let's play pool.

18:37.250 --> 18:37.648
(sighs)

18:37.650 --> 18:39.884
Okay.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.319
Hit the ball at the triangle

18:41.321 --> 18:43.681
and sink as many balls
as you can.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.892
(pool balls clack)

18:47.894 --> 18:49.560
And that means we lost.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.761
Now we have to wait again.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.631
Pool is so boring.
It's so much standing around.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.500
It's worse than baseball.

18:55.502 --> 18:58.469
Well, there's usually some good
conversation to pass the time.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.804
Like what?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.772
What was so fun that
you and Tony talked about?

19:01.774 --> 19:04.809
Hey, pretend
I'm your pool buddy Jess.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.845
See? Nobody can tell
my gender, either.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.781
All right, we were debating
who'd win in a fight...

19:10.783 --> 19:13.251
A Cabbage Patch Kid
possessed by a demon

19:13.253 --> 19:15.286
or Teddy Ruxpin
with a Metallica tape in him.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.854
Teddy Ruxpin? Is that
the little guy from "Twins"?

19:16.856 --> 19:19.323
- No.
- What was the fight about?

19:19.325 --> 19:21.592
Was it a money issue?
Most fights are.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.027
I don't know.
They're just fighting.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.596
This is what you talk about?
It's so dumb.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.198
That's the point!
We talk about whatever.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.450
Like when you and Honey
hang out.

19:29.451 --> 19:31.701
Honey and I do not talk about
dumb things.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.939
We talk about who we would haunt
if we were ghosts

19:34.941 --> 19:37.675
or which vegetable
would make the best weapon,

19:37.677 --> 19:41.179
or we talk about if one of us
turned into an animal,

19:41.181 --> 19:43.281
how would we get
the other one's attention...

19:43.282 --> 19:45.602
You know what?
I get it. I see your point.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.788
Louis. (Sighs)

19:50.790 --> 19:53.191
I was almost not right.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.993
I shouldn't keep you
from talking to somebody

19:55.995 --> 19:57.962
about dumb things.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.964
I don't want to be that person.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.066
You mean the "wet blanket" wife?

20:02.067 --> 20:04.167
No, I mean the person
you talk to about dumb things.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.803
(chuckles)

20:05.805 --> 20:08.573
You have nothing to worry about.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.655
Trust me.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.010
I do.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.812
So it's okay
if I play pool with her?

20:14.814 --> 20:17.081
Yes.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.082
Mm.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.584
I just have one request.

20:21.187 --> 20:24.522
(up-tempo song plays)

20:24.524 --> 20:26.023
Choco Taco?

20:26.025 --> 20:28.893
I thought you were getting
ice cream with Nicole.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.997
I wanted to say sorry
about before.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.832
Alison told me she used to
have a crush on you,

20:34.834 --> 20:36.500
and I got jealous.

20:36.502 --> 20:37.868
Wait. Alison used to
have a crush on me?

20:37.870 --> 20:40.304
You're a good dude.

20:40.673 --> 20:44.675
Anyways, I just went nuts,
and I can't explain it.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.845
I guess I still can't believe
Alison really likes me.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.514
I can. You're a good dude, too.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.684
Maybe one day you and Alison

20:53.686 --> 20:55.586
and me and Jasmine
could double-date.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.288
I'd like that.

21:07.533 --> 21:08.633
Well, I mean, it really depends

21:08.635 --> 21:10.368
what Metallica tape
we're talking about,

21:10.370 --> 21:12.570
"Master of Puppets"
or "Ride the Lightning"?

21:12.572 --> 21:13.938
"Master of Puppets," obviously.

21:13.940 --> 21:14.639
I mean, he is a talking bear.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.441
(laughs)

21:17.443 --> 21:18.542
Hey!

21:18.544 --> 21:20.044
No touching.

21:20.046 --> 21:20.811
You know Jessica's rules.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.613
Right.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.582
Sorry. Uh...

21:24.584 --> 21:25.650
Your shot, Tony.

21:25.652 --> 21:28.319
Thank you. (Clears throat)

21:28.321 --> 21:30.321
(pool balls clack)
