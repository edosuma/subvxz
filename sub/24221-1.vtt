14:46.520 --> 14:48.000
<i>Here we are again.</i>

14:48.320 --> 14:50.437
Look, it's just a stretch of bad luck.
I'll figure it out.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.196
<i>Father used to say
we make our own luck.</i>

14:54.600 --> 14:56.353
Yeah, well, Dad said
a lot of things.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.239
<i>You were arrested
in a rogue Jaeger.</i>

14:58.640 --> 14:59.790
Hold on a second.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.155
That wasn't my Jaeger.
There's this little kid.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.437
- She's about this tall...
- <i>You have priors.</i>

15:03.880 --> 15:05.633
<i>This is serious.</i>

15:05.720 --> 15:06.710
Okay.

15:06.920 --> 15:09.037
That's why
I need my big sis

15:09.120 --> 15:10.759
to help me get the hell
out of here.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.274
Just one last time.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.991
<i>They are not going
to let you just walk.</i>

15:15.080 --> 15:17.117
<i>But there might be
another way.</i>

15:17.280 --> 15:18.839
Okay. See, that's
what I wanna hear.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.196
That's what I'm here to talk
about, the other way.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.476
Lay it on me.
What do I gotta do?

15:22.640 --> 15:24.871
<i>Re-enlist and finish
what you started.</i>

15:25.640 --> 15:26.710
I'm not doing that.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.439
Look, I'm too old
to be a cadet.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.239
<i>I don't want you
to be a cadet.</i>

15:30.320 --> 15:31.913
<i>I want you to help
train them.</i>

15:32.080 --> 15:34.311
Train who? Train what?
I'm not training no damn kids.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.712
<i>The transport is standing by to
bring both of you to Moyulan.</i>

15:37.800 --> 15:38.790
Both of us?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.673
<i>You and your new recruit.</i>

15:40.840 --> 15:41.830
Mako.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.999
I can't believe she just
hologrammed me.

16:12.040 --> 16:14.032
JAKE: Yeah, look.
I didn't have a choice.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.630
AMARA: I know, I get it.
But why me?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.712
Why do they want me
for the program?

16:18.880 --> 16:20.712
You built and piloted
your own Jaeger.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.439
These people like
that kind of stuff.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.314
Okay, so then
why am I just a cadet,

16:24.400 --> 16:26.471
and you get
to be a ranger?

16:28.240 --> 16:29.515
Valor Omega.

16:31.480 --> 16:32.709
Oh, my God.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.440
That... That is
Valor Omega!

16:46.040 --> 16:47.599
You gotta be kidding me.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.957
I didn't believe it when they
told me you were inbound.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.556
How you doing, Nate?

16:51.720 --> 16:52.710
It's Ranger Lambert.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.236
Are you having a laugh?

16:54.400 --> 16:55.436
This is a military base.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.876
You remember how that works,
Ranger Pentecost.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.720
And you must be
Amara Namani.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.477
Yes, sir. Ranger, sir.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.472
Well, let's get you
squared away.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.279
Oh, and try not to steal
anything while you're here.

17:12.119 --> 17:13.998
Did that haircut
just call you Pentecost?

17:14.160 --> 17:16.720
As in badass
Stacker Pentecost?

17:16.839 --> 17:21.153

of basically the whole world?

17:21.240 --> 17:22.720
It's just a name.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.115
Yeah. A really cool name.

starts at 0600.

You're late,
you miss the day.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.671
You fall behind, you'll be
on the next transport

17:32.760 --> 17:34.160

they found you.

17:34.360 --> 17:36.317
That's Titan Redeemer!

17:43.680 --> 17:45.319
I love Saber Athena!

17:45.480 --> 17:47.312
She's the fastest Jaeger in the fleet.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.278

which one's yours?

17:55.200 --> 17:56.190
Gipsy.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.874
You pilot Gipsy Avenger?

18:02.040 --> 18:03.110
JULES: He used to.

18:03.280 --> 18:06.273
Until his co-pilot got a better
offer in the private sector.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.358
Jules Reyes. J-Tech.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.478
Amara. Cadet.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.556
Jake.

18:12.720 --> 18:13.870
Ranger, apparently.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.480
Heard a lot about you,
Pentecost.

18:15.840 --> 18:16.830
Yeah?

18:16.920 --> 18:17.990
You know you still
hold the record?

18:18.200 --> 18:19.475
- What record?
- Shut up.

18:19.960 --> 18:23.317
So how'd they lure you back?
I mean, it couldn't have been the pay, so...

18:23.480 --> 18:24.709
Yeah, it's a long story.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.997
But if you want to talk about it,
we can meet up...

18:27.160 --> 18:28.753

training bright and early.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.600
And this is
Ranger Pentecost.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.274
He will be helping me
instruct you

19:11.440 --> 19:14.239
until I can find a new co-pilot
to replace Ranger Burke.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.155

away and prepped for training.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.550

19:33.240 --> 19:34.640

by a Pentecost!

19:38.200 --> 19:41.238
Not like he was the one who
died helping close the Breach.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.551

been in combat.

for round two.

you see this? (LAUGHS)

19:48.720 --> 19:51.997
Uh, hey.
So where should I...

19:52.160 --> 19:53.879
Heard you built
your own little Jaeger.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.235
Yeah.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.913
Actually. Scrapper.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.472

with this solo bay...

You want to put junk together,
be a mechanic.

20:02.360 --> 20:03.840

- Vik?
- SURESH: It's short for Viktoria.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.554

to call her that.

20:18.720 --> 20:19.756
Yeah. What's her problem?

20:19.880 --> 20:21.678
Took her three shots
to pass the entrance test.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.957
Yeah. Don't think she likes
how you landed here.

20:24.040 --> 20:25.520
It's not my fault.

come around back home.

have something here.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.878

excuses, Cadet.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.750
You putting her up against Kaiju
that almost killed veteran pilots,

21:51.840 --> 21:53.274
doesn't make any sense.

21:53.360 --> 21:55.317

that doesn't belong here.

Wow.

for a better drift pilot.

it has something to do

with them sending giant monsters
to kick the crap out of us.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.880
No, no, no. The Precursors
wouldn't send Kaiju

were trying to wipe us all out.

I don't have a problem with you, man.

pretty face and prison.

- I was hoping you'd be tagging along.

I could use your help on an

If we hadn't yanked that intel
out of that Kaiju's brain,

26:00.760 --> 26:02.433
Raleigh would've never been
able to close the Breach.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.353

we could make this quick, or...

- Of Jaegers.

26:12.040 --> 26:14.430

it takes too much time.

No.

No. There's no fuel in the world with
that kind of boost-to-mass ratio.

is highly reactive

You can't be fooling around with this stuff.
You're gonna blow yourself up.

take a look, please.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.834

55:52.920 --> 55:55.480
It was over something stupid.
I can't even remember what.

55:55.960 --> 55:58.680
So, I climbed in
an old Mark IV,

55:58.760 --> 56:01.400
just to show him I didn't need
him to be a great pilot.

56:01.480 --> 56:04.154
- That's pretty dumb.
- Yeah.

56:04.440 --> 56:05.635

56:05.720 --> 56:07.871
About seven steps.
Take or leave.

56:07.960 --> 56:08.950
How far did you get?

56:09.040 --> 56:11.794
About two steps,
and I blacked out from the strain.

56:12.400 --> 56:14.915
And the first thing I saw
when I woke up was my dad,

56:15.000 --> 56:17.231
just standing right in front of me,
looking stern.

56:17.320 --> 56:18.834
What did he say?

56:19.560 --> 56:21.153
He said I was
out of the program.

56:21.240 --> 56:23.277
He said I didn't deserve
to be in a Jaeger.

56:23.400 --> 56:24.720
Look, he said
a lot of things.

56:27.880 --> 56:29.599
A year later,
my dad was gone.

56:31.320 --> 56:32.959
And I didn't get a chance
to prove him wrong.

56:33.040 --> 56:36.078
More importantly,
I didn't get a chance to prove it to myself.

56:37.400 --> 56:38.880
You listen to me.

56:39.760 --> 56:42.798
Don't let what other people
think of you define who you are.

56:43.200 --> 56:46.955

you're telling me right now?

57:34.440 --> 57:35.556
Yes.

57:36.080 --> 57:39.676
Yeah. I stole a ton
to make Scrapper.

57:42.840 --> 57:44.160

it might be important.

that to connect Fury to Shao.

"Oh, no" what?

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.319
Three Kaiju

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.872
South Korea, Russian coast,
and East China Sea.

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.591

what do we got?

The reports
are still coming in,

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.116
but drones took out Jaegers and
Shatterdomes across the Rim.

01:09:42.319 --> 01:09:43.435
All right.
How many Jaegers do we have here?

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.279
Operational?
Gipsy Avenger, barely.

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:46.470
- That's it?
- Yeah.

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.439
Okay. We need more Jaegers up and running
or this is gonna be a short fight.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:52.200
Even if we can, all of our other pilots
are either dead or severely injured.

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:54.960
One disaster at a time.
Let's just focus on those Jaegers.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.393
Smallie, come over here.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:05.758
I need you to help Jules with
the repairs. Can you do that?

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.470
I thought I was kicked out.

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.474
I'm kicking you back in.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.833
She's pretty good at
turning junk into Jaegers.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.395
You good with that?

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:15.870
Hell yeah.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.150
JAKE: All right.
We got a lot of work to do

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.754
and not a lot of time.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.030
We got incoming!

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.079
I brought some help!

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.551
Hakuja, Shrikethorn,

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.512
and the big fella, Raijin.

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.195
I took the liberty
of assigning the designations.

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.873
Well, the spiky guy
and the big idiot

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.917
are moving away from the
cities and towards the ocean.

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.070
What does that mean?

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.031
Maybe they're trying to link up
with Hakuja in the East China Sea.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.510
Yeah, I bet Newt would know
what they're up to

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.036
if we can get it
out of him.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.237
Yeah, we'd have
to find him first.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:20.677
Any Jaegers closer
to those Kaiju than us?

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:23.594
What was left of the Chin-do and
Sakhalinsk domes tried to intercept.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.996
Emphasis on "tried."

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.436
- I'm afraid we're on our own.
- LAMBERT: There's gotta be something here.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.473
Something in
the East China Sea.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.320
Maybe that's not
where they're headed.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:35.756
Pull up a map of Kaiju
movement from the war.

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.559
Pushing data
to main display.

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.160
What, do you know
something we don't?

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.194
You said we need to understand
our enemy's objective

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.239
to know
we've beaten them.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.558
What if the Kaiju weren't blindly
attacking our cities during the war?

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.559
What if we were
just in their way?

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.790
Right here.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.035
Mount Fuji, Japan.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.080
Extrapolate for Hakuja,
Shrikethorn and Raijin.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.559
Mount Fuji? But why?

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.956
Rare earth elements.

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.070
Huh?

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:14.830
Mount Fuji is a volcano rich
in rare earth elements.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.118
Kaiju blood reacts extremely
violently with rare earth elements

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.874
is the basis of my fuel-thruster experiments.
Excuse me.

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.915
- That sounds bad. That's bad, right?
- Very.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.754
Mount Fuji's active.
A geological pressure point.

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:29.151
Based on the blood
to mass ratio of the Kaiju,

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.590
the reaction would cause
a cascade event,

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:34.673
igniting the Ring of Fire
around the Pacific Rim.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.950
Billions of tons of toxic gas and
ash will spew into the atmosphere,

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.794
wiping out all life.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.480
LIWEN: And finish
terraforming the Earth

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.395

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.279
We can't let them
reach Mount Fuji.

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.079
I'm gonna check with Jules
for Jaeger repairs.

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.597
Even if we had a hundred Jaegers,
there's no way to intercept in time.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.680
What about your
thruster pods?

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.712
Oh, no, no, no.
They're not ready.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:58.996
Can they be?

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.520
Well, in theory, maybe,
with your help.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:04.797
Gottlieb, what does
that mean, "in theory"?

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.310
Today,

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.789
it means yes.

It's not a lot
to work with.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.635
Liwen can patch some Fury tech
into Gipsy that might help.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.070
Hey...

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.317
- Prep everything we got for deployment.
- Okay.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.559
Don't get yourself killed.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.555
You either.

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.793
Well, that's confusing.

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.600
Let's just stay focused.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:29.753
We got four Jaegers against two
Category-Fours and a Fiver.

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.434
It's better
than just Gipsy.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.273
We still need pilots.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:34.950
We have them.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.670
Oh, shit.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.080

he'd probably give you a big speech.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.199
I'm not my father.

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.273
I'm not a hero
like he was.

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.553
Like Raleigh Becket

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.560
and Mako Mori.

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.711
But they didn't
start out that way.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.634
They started out as cadets,
just like you.

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:23.593
We remember them as giants
because they stood tall.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.909
Because they
stood together.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.794
It doesn't matter
who your parents are,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.311
where you came from,
who believed in you and who didn't.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.960
We are a family now.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.113
And we are Earth's
last defense.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:40.276
This is our time, this is our
chance to make a difference.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.595

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:20.637
- Hurry!
- Get over here! Hurry up!

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:24.117
Move! We have to go!

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:26.590
Twenty kilometers to impact.
Get out of there!

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:28.750
Go! Go!

01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:34.957
(ROARING)

01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:37.955
We're in! Close the door!

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:45.120
(ROARS)

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:46.873
- Hang on!
- I am hanging on!

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:47.950
Hang tighter!

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:49.950
(GRUNTS)

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:07.350
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:20.119
(SOFT GROWL)

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:25.713
(GROANING)

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.434
(ALL CHEERING)

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.310
(CHUCKLES)

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:48.794
(CREW CHEERING)

01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:52.393
No! No!

01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.880
(GRUNTS)

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.110
Okay, you know what?

01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:57.954
Plan B. Always a Plan B.

01:38:58.040 --> 01:38:59.360
(NEWT GROANS)

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:03.755
Anyone who's listening,

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:05.880
<i>this is Ranger Lambert.</i>

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.317
<i>Be advised, we just
caught ourselves a Newt.</i>

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:09.516
JAKE: (CHUCKLES)
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:10.870
There he is.

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:12.670
I'm glad
you're still okay, man.

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.149
LAMBERT: (PANTING)
<i>You too, brother.</i>

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:15.469
<i>I knew you could do it.</i>

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:18.355
Well, I had a lot of help.

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:21.760
Nice work, Ranger Namani.

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:22.876
Thank you, sir.

01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:30.072
Never seen snow before.

01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:32.238
So out of all the things to notice right now,
you're noticing snow?

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:35.152
Big, dead Kaiju
is right there.

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.350
- Okay, okay, all right.
- And I'm not sure if you're...

01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:39.194
Is this the part where you're gonna give
me one of those big, dumb speeches?

01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.272
Did everyone think it was dumb,
or is that just your opinion...

01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:43.073
Just be honest. How many times did you
practice that in front of the mirror?

01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:45.231
It was motivational.
You can be whoever you wanna be.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.874
- AMARA: (GRUNTS) Ha-ha!
- Ow!

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.275
- Okay. Now you wanna play that?
- Fire!

01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:50.671
- I'm a natural at this.
- No, you're not a natural because...

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:52.234
Oh! Give me a break.
I've never done this before!

01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:53.680
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:54.790
God...

01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:56.280
There you go.
Boom!

01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:58.079
(BOTH PANTING)

01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:01.113
We did it!

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:23.710
You think
this is over, huh?

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:26.480
You think you've saved
your crappy little world?

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:28.754
We're gonna keep coming!

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.150
We are never going to stop

01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:32.594
and sooner or later

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:35.156
(DISTORTED) your luck
is going to run out!

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:39.510
Nah.

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:42.073
The things in your head?

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.436
The Precursors?

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:45.760
Tell them we're not afraid.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:47.516
Tell them, next time,

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:49.678
they won't need to worry
about coming for us.

01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:52.917
Because we're gonna
come for them.
