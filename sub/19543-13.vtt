WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:07.167
Having returned, Son Goku overpowers Nappa!

00:10.302 --> 00:13.510
Impossible! That was my greatest technique!

00:13.597 --> 00:14.632
That's enough!

00:14.723 --> 00:17.806
You're getting us nowhere!
I'll take care of him!

00:17.893 --> 00:18.973
What?!

00:19.061 --> 00:20.722
You're pathetic!

00:20.813 --> 00:26.024
Imagine, me, actually having
to take action against Kakarrot!

00:27.986 --> 00:30.898
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

00:30.989 --> 00:34.072
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

00:34.159 --> 00:38.198
The Genki Dama bursts away

00:38.288 --> 00:41.621
Go Go Let's do it

00:42.835 --> 00:48.626
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

00:48.716 --> 00:54.586
I won't hold back, just you watch

00:54.680 --> 01:00.550
I'll protect you with my life

01:00.644 --> 01:06.731
Turn your courage to love into strength

01:06.817 --> 01:12.733
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

01:12.823 --> 01:19.991
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

01:21.331 --> 01:24.198
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:24.293 --> 01:27.501
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

01:27.588 --> 01:33.128
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

01:33.218 --> 01:36.085
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:36.180 --> 01:39.343
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

01:39.433 --> 01:46.475
Your soul already knows the answer

01:46.565 --> 01:50.183
Dragon Soul!

01:52.362 --> 01:58.824
"This is the Kaio-ken!!
The Critical Battle of Goku vs. Vegeta. "

02:03.624 --> 02:05.990
D-Damn.

02:06.084 --> 02:10.327
T-To think that I'd have to turn
over your execution to Vegeta.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.789
Orders are orders. I'll let
Vegeta take care of you.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.967
But I can't let it end with
me withdrawing like this.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.971
Crap! The other two!

02:26.438 --> 02:28.770
It's no use! I won't make it in time!

02:33.278 --> 02:36.441
Kaio-ken!!

02:36.532 --> 02:38.022
What?!

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:02.182 --> 03:04.093
Damn...!

03:04.184 --> 03:06.891
He ain't able to fight anymore.

03:06.979 --> 03:10.392
Take him, and get yourselves
off of Earth, right now.

03:10.482 --> 03:12.689
W-What was that just now?

03:12.776 --> 03:16.815
For a moment, his speed
and power shot up sharply!

03:18.615 --> 03:21.607
G-Goku, how did you do that?

03:21.702 --> 03:25.035
Is that a technique you learned
from that Kaio-sama guy?

03:25.122 --> 03:28.865
Yeah. It's called "Kaio-ken."

03:28.959 --> 03:33.953
By controlling all the Ki in your body,
you amplify it momentarily.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.709
If you do it right, your power,
speed, destructive force,

03:36.800 --> 03:40.384
and defensive force all
multiply many times over.

03:40.470 --> 03:43.553
T-That's awesome! As strong as you've become,

03:43.640 --> 03:47.132
you can still become many
times stronger than even that?

03:47.227 --> 03:50.185
--Yeah.
--Goku, you're such a tease!

03:50.272 --> 03:52.684
This is no time to be playing around, right?

03:52.774 --> 03:57.359
If you had that up your sleeve,
you should have used it from the start.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.903
Sorry, I couldn't do that.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.652
If I don't control it while
throttling my Kijust right,

04:02.743 --> 04:05.530
I could really mess myself up.

04:05.621 --> 04:07.111
Basically...

04:07.205 --> 04:09.787
Just to press the point, at your level,

04:09.875 --> 04:12.958
you cannot use the Kaio-ken too heavily.

04:13.045 --> 04:17.129
If your control slips up,
you'll end up damaging your body.

04:17.214 --> 04:21.548
Keep your power down to double,
at the most. Understood?

04:21.637 --> 04:26.757
Performing a Kaio-ken beyond that
will put too great a strain on your body.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.592
Put another way, your body won't
be able to keep up with the Kaio-ken,

04:29.686 --> 04:32.063
and it will end up backfiring on you.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.433
Mm-hmm, I got it.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.650
And that's the story.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.690
O-Oh...

04:37.778 --> 04:43.193
V-Vegeta... h-help me...

04:47.245 --> 04:50.203
T-Thanks...

04:51.541 --> 04:53.918
Hmph, not at all.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.336
W-What are you--

05:02.427 --> 05:05.294
Vegeta! Vegeta!!

05:05.389 --> 05:09.598
I have no need for a Saiyan who can't move!

05:16.817 --> 05:19.183
W-What a Ki!

05:20.570 --> 05:22.435
F-Father!

05:22.531 --> 05:24.772
W-What's going on?!

05:24.866 --> 05:26.652
Die!

05:38.338 --> 05:42.752
V-Vegeta!!

06:05.032 --> 06:11.403
W-W-What a monster!
He even killed his own buddy!

06:19.921 --> 06:21.957
Gohan, Kuririn,

06:22.049 --> 06:25.962
the two of you go on back to
the Kame House, right now.

06:29.431 --> 06:32.173
R-Right.

06:32.267 --> 06:35.634
Gohan, you heard him. Hurry, let's go.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.560
B-But...

06:37.647 --> 06:40.104
Gohan, he's too much for us.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.808
We won't be of any help
if we stick around here.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.770
And our being here will just distract Goku,

06:45.864 --> 06:47.900
and make him worry over us.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.612
Really, Father?

06:51.703 --> 06:53.534
Sorry about that.

06:53.622 --> 06:58.366
It looks like his strength
is greater than I thought.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.202
O-Okay, I understand.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.662
Oh, yeah. Goku, as long as you're fighting,

07:03.757 --> 07:06.840
could you do it in another location?

07:06.927 --> 07:10.294
It wouldn't do to let everyone's
bodies here get all messed up,

07:10.388 --> 07:12.640
once we bring them back to life again.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.589
Bring them back to life?

07:14.684 --> 07:17.847
Piccolo is dead, so Kami-sama is dead, too.

07:17.938 --> 07:22.056
The Dragon Balls are now gone forever.

07:22.150 --> 07:25.984
I hate to say it, but they ain't
ever coming back to life.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.733
Yeah, I know that.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.816
K-Kuririn-san, by any chance...

07:31.910 --> 07:34.526
W-What?

07:34.621 --> 07:37.363
I'll explain it all to you later.

07:37.457 --> 07:41.041
That is, if you're able to beat him, Goku.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.996
If I can beat him, huh? Yeah.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.081
I have to beat him, at any rate,

07:47.175 --> 07:49.131
no matter what.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.420
What are you waiting for?

07:53.515 --> 07:55.881
What happened to all that
enthusiasm you had a moment ago?

07:55.976 --> 07:58.433
Have you lost your nerve and
decided to huddle up and run away?

07:58.520 --> 08:03.059
Okay then, well, I guess I'll
change locations, and do my best.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.687
In any case, let me handle this.

08:05.777 --> 08:11.238
Goku, sorry about always having
to leave our fate up to you alone.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.986
Don't you dare go dying now, my good friend.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.119
Yeah.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.908
Father...

08:23.003 --> 08:25.665
Gohan...

08:25.755 --> 08:27.370
...after Daddy comes back home alive,

08:27.465 --> 08:30.332
let's go fishing together or something, okay?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.014
Okay!

08:42.105 --> 08:44.892
It looks like you realize that
there's no use in running away.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.770
We're going to change our battle location.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.649
Suit yourself. It will all turn out the same.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.696
Father...

09:10.467 --> 09:12.128
I should have known as much.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.710
He's following with confidence to spare.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.223
Gohan...

09:27.317 --> 09:28.978
Hey, Gohan!

09:29.069 --> 09:31.776
--Yes?
--Let's hurry back to the Kame House.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.444
Mm-hmm.

09:35.450 --> 09:41.195
Let's stop worrying. We've turned
over the fate of the Earth to him.

09:42.582 --> 09:47.042
It'll be all right, Gohan.
Goku is sure to take care of him.

09:48.546 --> 09:53.961
Now, let's go. Hurry back and show
your mother that you're all right.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.508
Right!

10:04.062 --> 10:08.726
Here should be all right. There ain't
any people or animals around.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.654
I see...

10:16.741 --> 10:21.030
So this is the place you've
chosen to be your grave, is it?

10:26.042 --> 10:28.294
You should rejoice.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.369
After all, a lower-class warrior like you

10:30.463 --> 10:34.206
is going to get toyed around
with by a super-elite.

10:37.804 --> 10:42.047
Soon after Saiyans are born, their
capabilities as soldiers are tested.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.009
The scum whose ratings are low

10:45.103 --> 10:49.767
are then sent to worlds without
tough opponents, like you were.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.064
In other words...

10:51.151 --> 10:53.312
...you were an outcast!

10:53.403 --> 10:56.645
And as a result, I was able
to come here to Earth.

10:56.740 --> 10:59.823
I should be grateful. Besides...

10:59.909 --> 11:01.820
...maybe even an outcast can surpass an elite

11:01.911 --> 11:04.493
if he tries desperately enough.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.664
That's a pretty good joke.

11:10.462 --> 11:12.248
Well then, let me show you a wall

11:12.339 --> 11:16.332
that you will never be able
to get over with effort alone!

12:25.203 --> 12:28.536
What's the matter, Kakarrot?!
You can do better than that, can't you?!

12:28.623 --> 12:32.332
You were giving more than
this when you beat Nappa!

12:32.419 --> 12:34.034
Let me see it!

12:39.175 --> 12:44.340
Impressive. He ain't even
taking this seriously yet,

12:44.431 --> 12:48.800
but his speed and technique
are already beyond mine.

12:48.893 --> 12:54.604
Show me, unless you've already
used up all your strength.

12:54.691 --> 12:58.434
All right! I'll show you!

13:19.466 --> 13:21.377
Kaio-ken!!

13:45.492 --> 13:47.198
If that was the limit of what you've got,

13:47.285 --> 13:49.776
I'm going to be very disappointed.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.157
What a brute this guy is...

13:53.708 --> 13:55.790
But then...

13:55.877 --> 14:00.462
...for as much trouble as I'm in
right now, I'm starting to get excited.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.915
He's laughing? Has he given
up hope, and turned defiant?

14:04.010 --> 14:08.674
Or does he know he is capable of
raising his battle power even higher?

14:08.765 --> 14:11.507
Well?! Are you done already?!

14:11.601 --> 14:13.887
That appears to be all you've got.

14:13.978 --> 14:17.436
Well then, allow me to show
you something before you die...

14:19.067 --> 14:23.151
The overwhelming power
of a super-elite Saiyan!

14:23.238 --> 14:26.105
That disagreeable grin of yours is
going to be wiped away soon enough.

15:16.124 --> 15:20.993
What a Ki! It's as if the
entire Earth is trembling!

15:48.281 --> 15:51.694
It's a full-on typhoon!

16:35.953 --> 16:39.081
The air has stopped quivering.

16:39.165 --> 16:42.123
A-All of the clouds have been blown away.

16:53.805 --> 16:56.262
It's over, Kakarrot.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.271
You fool! Behind you!

17:17.994 --> 17:21.078
Kaio-ken, times two!!

17:32.802 --> 17:35.919
All right, nicely dodged.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.844
I made that one easy for you to dodge.

17:37.932 --> 17:41.095
It wouldn't be any fun if you died too easily.

17:48.776 --> 17:52.394
Damn, what power and speed he has!

17:52.488 --> 17:56.777
Not even my times-two Kaio-ken
can keep up with him.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.320
Ain't much else I can do, huh?

18:03.875 --> 18:07.083
This may wreck my body,
but it's better than olying.

18:07.170 --> 18:10.412
I ain't got any choice but to raise
my Kaio-ken to triple-strength.

18:13.384 --> 18:15.090
I've already come so close,

18:15.178 --> 18:17.965
so there's no point in not checkin'
them out, and what do Isee?

18:18.055 --> 18:20.546
That punk and Goku're both so strong,

18:20.641 --> 18:23.428
it's like I'm havin' a nightmare.

18:27.023 --> 18:32.108
Now then, once I raise my
Kaio-ken to times-three,

18:32.195 --> 18:36.029
I wonder how long my body
will be able to hold out.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.858
What's the matter, Kakarrot? Come and get me!

18:39.952 --> 18:42.659
Either way, I've got no choice but to do it.

18:42.747 --> 18:45.454
The way things are going,
there ain't any way I can win.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.250
Don't you have anything else up your sleeve?

18:49.337 --> 18:51.703
Looks like you messed with the wrong guy.

18:51.798 --> 18:55.962
Even among the other Saiyans,
I was the most powerful man around.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.792
No matter how much you may have trained,

18:57.887 --> 19:00.219
you're still just an outcast!

19:00.306 --> 19:04.549
You've only put off the time of
your defeat by a few moments.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.259
This ain't good.

19:06.354 --> 19:10.142
That Saiyan bastard has him
completely overpowered.

19:10.233 --> 19:13.270
Maybe I'd better get outta here while I can.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.067
Uh-huh, l oughtta beat it.

19:15.154 --> 19:19.022
It don't do no good for me to be here, nope.

19:37.969 --> 19:41.587
May my body withstand this!
Times-three Kaio-ken!!

19:41.681 --> 19:46.766
N-No! You can't exceed
double-strength, Son Goku!

19:46.853 --> 19:51.267
Then again, as it stands,
there's definitely no way he can win.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.520
Imagine, that guy being so strong...

19:56.779 --> 20:00.442
This battle... may be hopeless.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.000
W-What's wrong?

20:17.091 --> 20:19.002
H-Has something happened?

20:19.093 --> 20:23.006
It's probably Son-kun,
but this battle power reading

20:23.097 --> 20:25.338
i-is rising like crazy!

20:25.433 --> 20:26.969
--Goku!
--Goku-sa!

20:27.059 --> 20:31.678
17,000... 19,000... 21,000...

20:33.941 --> 20:36.398
O-Oh, no...

21:12.480 --> 21:14.516
W-What?!

21:20.821 --> 21:25.315
Goku uses the forbidden triple Kaio-ken.

21:25.409 --> 21:29.448
Will his body be able to
withstand this ultra-power?

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Fly away into the boundless skies

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
We'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
and zip away to wherever we want

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Being a daredevil is the best

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
This eye-opening blue Earth of ours

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
You were born

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
to protect the world in these uncertain times

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Go at it full power

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Hope is my weapon,

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
so believe in the future

22:34.311 --> 22:35.847
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:35.938 --> 22:38.771
My body's been worn ragged
from using this triple Kaio-ken.

22:38.858 --> 22:42.726
How can your battle power be
greater than mine?! I won't have it!

22:42.820 --> 22:44.936
I'll have to finish this fight
with a Genki Dama.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.067
I'm going to settle this, right now, Vegeta!

22:47.158 --> 22:48.648
That's what I was going to say!

22:48.743 --> 22:51.359
I may hate how ugly it is,
but it's time for the big guns!

22:51.454 --> 22:53.240
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:53.330 --> 22:57.164
"The Impact of the Kamehame-Ha!
Vegeta's Tenacious Transformation. ”

22:57.251 --> 22:59.958
I'm going to fight too, Father!
