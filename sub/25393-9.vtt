WEBVTT

00:12.013 --> 00:15.100
Here He comes.
The light upon the world.

00:25.026 --> 00:27.946
Ooh! Ooh! Oh!

00:32.659 --> 00:36.162
Oh, yeah. He is something else.

00:45.255 --> 00:47.674
Any last words, Mr. Custer?

00:47.757 --> 00:50.719
Yeah. I have a gun in my pocket.

00:50.802 --> 00:52.512
Wit till the very end.

00:52.595 --> 00:54.639
I do. I have a gun in my inside pocket.

01:00.770 --> 01:03.231
See? Starr wanted me to kill you.

01:04.190 --> 01:08.778
Then he shall know my buttocks
as few men ever have.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.363
Now untie me.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.991
You jest.

01:13.074 --> 01:15.410
Well, you're gonna kill me
as soon as this works, right?

01:15.493 --> 01:16.494
Of course.

01:17.495 --> 01:20.331
Then let me die on my knees before God.

01:21.416 --> 01:22.625
You have your guards.

01:23.877 --> 01:25.712
You have the gun. You have your Messiah.

01:27.380 --> 01:30.175
Let me die a Christian.

01:35.513 --> 01:37.140
Not very trusting, are you?

01:38.141 --> 01:39.934
On your knees, man of God.

01:43.229 --> 01:44.689
Oh.

01:51.154 --> 01:54.324
Forgive me. Amen.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.284
Nothing more?

02:30.652 --> 02:32.362
No use struggling, Christian.

02:32.862 --> 02:35.907
I will have Genesis.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.336
Blessed Almighty!

04:20.136 --> 04:24.015
<i>Onward, Christian soldiers</i>

04:24.098 --> 04:27.101
<i>Marching as to war</i>

04:27.977 --> 04:31.147
<i>With the cross of Jesus</i>

04:31.689 --> 04:34.817
<i>Going on before</i>

04:35.485 --> 04:38.863
<i>Christ, the royal master</i>

04:38.947 --> 04:41.449
<i>Leads against the foe</i>

04:47.163 --> 04:48.164
No more singing.

05:14.649 --> 05:15.650
Hey.

05:16.901 --> 05:19.070
Where are you going
with my briefcase? Hmm?

05:22.448 --> 05:25.535
Give it back right now, and maybe
I don't beat the snot out of you.

05:28.246 --> 05:30.873
Small woman, do you know who I am?

05:31.249 --> 05:34.419
Yeah, you're the creepy skank
who stole our briefcase.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.593
I have other names.

05:43.428 --> 05:47.974
Abaddon. Azrael. The Angel of Death.

05:50.893 --> 05:54.689
What about "Satan's bitch"?

05:56.274 --> 05:57.442
He's your boss, right?

05:58.609 --> 06:02.030
Told you to go on up there
and grab Tulip O'Hare?

06:03.489 --> 06:04.782
Well, you done that part right.

06:05.825 --> 06:07.577
But the part you did really wrong

06:08.703 --> 06:11.372
was walk off with something
meant for his old lady friend.

06:12.290 --> 06:13.374
Madame L'Angelle?

06:14.542 --> 06:16.085
Your boss made a deal,

06:16.169 --> 06:19.213
and I'm guessing he's gonna rip
your pretty little head off

06:19.297 --> 06:20.715
when he hears you screwed up.

06:36.189 --> 06:37.356
I don't like you.

06:38.191 --> 06:39.400
You don't have to.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.820
You just got to brush your teeth
every once in a while

06:42.904 --> 06:45.698
and give me back the goddamn briefcase.

07:00.463 --> 07:01.464
I'll be seeing you.

07:14.352 --> 07:16.479
It's not... It's her, not me.

07:16.562 --> 07:19.899
Wait. I can't go to Hell!
I am a servant of God!

07:20.733 --> 07:21.734
Look.

07:24.278 --> 07:25.279
Listen.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.867
I don't know
who this O'Hare chick is, okay?

07:31.702 --> 07:32.954
But I know it ain't her.

07:35.790 --> 07:37.458
TULIP! TULIP!

07:38.292 --> 07:40.253
Tulip O'Hare! -It's me, Eugene!

07:54.058 --> 07:55.226
So long, Tulip.

08:04.110 --> 08:05.695
What a great surprise!

08:09.532 --> 08:10.533
Fuck.

08:22.253 --> 08:25.006
They were dead long before they met me.

08:25.089 --> 08:29.552
You have to understand,
everyone that comes here is lost.

08:29.635 --> 08:32.013
They've given up on mortality.
They're seeking something more.

08:32.096 --> 08:36.933
So I show them
the promise of the vampire life

08:37.018 --> 08:38.394
before they learn about the reality,

08:38.477 --> 08:40.395
the torment of our existence.

08:40.479 --> 08:41.731
You're a bloody mental case.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.857
I think you actually believe
your own bollocks, don't you?

08:43.941 --> 08:44.942
Listen to me.

08:45.026 --> 08:46.319
- I've been listening.
- Cassidy...

08:46.402 --> 08:49.655
"I kill people to set them free."
That's mental.

08:49.739 --> 08:51.574
You sound like
you're in a Kevin Spacey movie.

08:51.657 --> 08:53.910
Only, on top of that, it's a bloody lie.

08:53.993 --> 08:57.788
You've been killing all these people
for all these years because you like it.

08:57.872 --> 09:00.583
It gives you power, and it feels good.
So just admit it.

09:00.666 --> 09:01.667
All right.

09:03.002 --> 09:04.629
Cassidy, you have to try it.

09:05.004 --> 09:07.256
The rush. I mean, you would love it.

09:07.340 --> 09:08.758
We'll do it together. My fondest wish.

09:08.841 --> 09:11.052
Ever since the first time we met,
I knew I wanted to do this with you.

09:11.135 --> 09:13.512
They're not drugs, you arsehole.
They're people!

09:13.596 --> 09:16.015
All them hundreds you killed
were people.

09:16.098 --> 09:18.434
Lisa... Jesus Christ,
do you remember Lisa?

09:18.517 --> 09:20.478
- She trusted me.
- They're losers!

09:21.187 --> 09:24.565
Desperate posers just like you said.

09:24.649 --> 09:26.734
And if they want to be like us
and play with death,

09:26.817 --> 09:28.569
fine, let's play.

09:30.071 --> 09:31.948
- I'm going out there.
- No.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.449
I'm going out there,

09:33.532 --> 09:35.826
and I'm gonna tell them
exactly who you are.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.037
I can't let you do that.

09:39.747 --> 09:40.957
I won't let you.

10:08.276 --> 10:10.653
This is what
you've been looking for all along,

10:12.446 --> 10:15.366
someone to accept you and your flaws.

10:17.702 --> 10:19.036
Just accept me and mine.

10:21.205 --> 10:22.665
Please, Cassidy.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.960
We're this close to happiness.

10:28.212 --> 10:29.964
I'd rather be sad.

10:32.174 --> 10:33.926
Go on. Just get it over and done with.

10:35.511 --> 10:36.512
No.

10:38.556 --> 10:40.308
It's going to be worse than that.

10:47.857 --> 10:50.609
Very impressive, Messiah.

10:53.863 --> 10:56.490
Mission accomplished.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.895
Bravo, Messiah.

12:09.063 --> 12:10.064
We did it.

12:11.190 --> 12:12.274
On your knees.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.741
You son of a bitch!

12:20.825 --> 12:23.619
I should make you eat everything
in this goddamn room.

12:27.206 --> 12:28.958
Your head looks like a dick.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.210
So I've been told.

12:31.919 --> 12:32.920
Suits you.

12:34.130 --> 12:35.631
Well, Starr, I think we're done.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.217
So if there's nothing else...

12:38.843 --> 12:40.719
Just the apocalypse.

12:40.803 --> 12:41.929
<i>Ooh!</i>

12:49.228 --> 12:50.229
Ooh!

12:50.312 --> 12:51.689
Left on our own,

12:51.772 --> 12:55.276
we'll have to stop
the end of the world his way.

13:01.282 --> 13:04.493
<i>Allfather and the Grail
have infiltrated</i>

13:04.577 --> 13:06.871
<i>all the nuclear weapon states.</i>

13:06.954 --> 13:09.498
<i>Their agents wait, poised,</i>

13:10.499 --> 13:13.711
<i>ready to loose
their nuclear arsenals upon the world</i>

13:15.129 --> 13:16.797
<i>once they receive</i>

13:19.425 --> 13:20.634
<i>the signal.</i>

13:21.218 --> 13:24.972
<i>Give me that old soft shoe,
I said that old soft shoe</i>

13:25.055 --> 13:26.307
<i>A one, a two</i>

13:26.390 --> 13:28.058
<i>Two thousand years</i>

13:28.142 --> 13:32.062
<i>after the Romans nailed
His only begotten son to a cross,</i>

13:32.897 --> 13:35.983
<i>the Grail, protectors of the bloodline,</i>

13:36.066 --> 13:39.987
<i>will roll out Jesus' direct descendant.</i>

13:40.529 --> 13:41.530
Enable missiles.

13:41.614 --> 13:42.865
Number one enabled.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.492
- Two enabled.
- Three enabled.

13:44.575 --> 13:45.784
Go! Go! Go!

13:45.868 --> 13:48.954
<i>Play me that old soft shoe
and nothing else will do</i>

13:49.038 --> 13:52.124
<i>That's the dance my darling used to do</i>

13:54.335 --> 13:58.714
<i>And the world will have their
chance to accept him as their savior...</i>

14:11.143 --> 14:15.064
<i>Or reject him
and face eternal damnation</i>

14:15.147 --> 14:16.732
<i>in the coming apocalypse.</i>

14:29.370 --> 14:33.666
<i>The Grail has already infiltrated
all the nuclear weapon states.</i>

14:33.749 --> 14:35.751
<i>Missiles will fly.</i>

14:48.889 --> 14:53.602
<i>And when the music stops,
the unbelievers will burn.</i>

15:01.318 --> 15:04.196
<i>But the believers will survive</i>

15:04.280 --> 15:08.909
<i>and follow him
to a new paradise on Earth.</i>

15:14.540 --> 15:17.459
That is the worst apocalypse plan
I have ever heard.

15:17.668 --> 15:21.005
I agree.
Allfather was a lunatic.

15:21.422 --> 15:23.007
You can't kill everyone.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.677
Just the undesirables.

15:28.304 --> 15:31.932
Hipsters, Presbyterians,
trade unionists,

15:32.641 --> 15:33.767
the Danes.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.396
A few dozen delicately placed,

15:37.479 --> 15:40.441
low-yield fissile devices
ought to do the trick.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.735
With you as Messiah,

15:42.818 --> 15:46.947
we'll have this dung-hole of a planet
buffed back into shape in no time.

15:48.532 --> 15:54.622
You are obviously
as batshit crazy as Allfather was,

15:54.705 --> 15:57.750
so I'm gonna make this
as clear as I can.

15:57.833 --> 16:03.130
For the last time,
I am never gonna be your Messiah.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.384
Okay. Fine.

16:11.305 --> 16:13.223
I'll just go to the backup.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.563
I can't let that happen.

16:19.813 --> 16:22.232
Don't see there's anything
you can do about it,

16:22.316 --> 16:24.485
other than to agree to take his place.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.113
I'll get rid of him.

16:28.947 --> 16:31.867
You won't. I read your file.
You're not a murderer.

16:35.829 --> 16:38.957
Not that kind of murderer anyway.

16:41.669 --> 16:42.920
Be reasonable.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.463
He may be a moron,

16:44.546 --> 16:48.425
but he's the 17th-generation progeny
of Christ himself.

16:49.510 --> 16:53.472
The Grail needs a Messiah.
It's our entire business model!

16:53.555 --> 16:54.682
Stop!

16:58.102 --> 17:01.855
I'm sorry, Starr.
You're gonna need a new business.

17:21.834 --> 17:22.876
I still can't believe it!

17:23.877 --> 17:25.170
Running into you...like this.

17:25.253 --> 17:26.588
Yeah. Crazy.

17:29.758 --> 17:30.759
So you're going to Hell, huh?

17:30.968 --> 17:32.219
Not if I can help it.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.181
I always heard you liked to fight...

17:36.598 --> 17:37.850
and curse...and were...

17:38.726 --> 17:40.519
promiscuous but I guess
I didn't realize things had

17:40.602 --> 17:41.603
gotten so far out of hand.

17:41.979 --> 17:45.482
This is a mistake.
I am not supposed to be going to Hell.

17:45.566 --> 17:46.567
Oh my gosh! Me too!

17:47.484 --> 17:50.279
The only place
I'm supposed to be going is off

17:50.779 --> 17:53.574
this damn bus!

17:59.079 --> 18:00.080
<i>Ja.</i>

18:00.706 --> 18:01.707
Not surprised.

18:02.416 --> 18:05.294
I drove this <i>hölle</i> express
for many years.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.629
No one ever got off.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.132
Not without help anyway.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.592
We don't want your help.

18:12.342 --> 18:15.095
I wasn't offering it.
I was merely making conversation.

18:15.179 --> 18:17.097
Ok, well maybe we don't want to have
a conversation with you.

18:17.181 --> 18:18.307
It's a free country.

18:18.390 --> 18:19.516
Well silence is golden, so...

18:19.600 --> 18:20.601
Quiet, woman! You'll...

18:23.520 --> 18:24.605
Now look what you've done!

18:32.488 --> 18:35.240
I was telling her! Behave yourself!

18:51.924 --> 18:52.925
How's your back?

18:58.847 --> 19:01.099
My advice to you is, just sit tight.

19:01.809 --> 19:05.604
I don't sit tight.
Sitting tight is not an option.

19:12.903 --> 19:14.780
She saved your ass back there.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.367
Please. I was talking my way
out of there just fine.

19:19.785 --> 19:21.829
And she was on her way to Hell
sooner or later anyway.

19:23.956 --> 19:25.165
Man, you're a bitch.

19:25.249 --> 19:26.583
What are you, a Boy Scout?

19:32.214 --> 19:35.551
So she's gonna eat these? Then what?

19:44.393 --> 19:47.062
Is that a paw or a hoof or a...

19:47.145 --> 19:48.856
Pain in the ass is what it is.

19:49.731 --> 19:53.652
Gonna take a while
to clean out all the what-not.

19:54.111 --> 19:55.654
You got the souls. I'm out.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.574
<i>Herr</i> Starr doesn't do well
for long stretches without me.

20:28.437 --> 20:29.688
Guys! Guys!

20:29.771 --> 20:32.566
We've all got to get out of here
right now before he gets back.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.192
He's a bleeding maniac!

20:34.276 --> 20:35.569
Do you know
what he's done to your mates?

20:35.652 --> 20:38.530
What he's gonna do to all of youse?
Nobody's flying anywhere.

20:38.614 --> 20:40.616
Do you know what? I am gonna bolt.
I'm gonna bolt right now.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.367
Come on. Let's go. Who's coming with me?

20:42.451 --> 20:43.744
Come on. We should all go right now!

20:43.827 --> 20:46.288
Come on! What?

20:46.830 --> 20:48.290
You killed Mr. Hoover.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.584
Listen to me.
I didn't kill Mr. bloody Hoover.

20:50.667 --> 20:53.378
I stopped him killing Hoover.
He killed Lisa. He killed Deng.

20:53.462 --> 20:55.589
He's killed all the others,
and he's gonna kill you, too,

20:55.672 --> 20:57.716
just so he can flit about
in the bloody sky.

20:57.799 --> 20:59.259
I mean, God knows what else he can do.

20:59.343 --> 21:03.096
Listen. Listen. Eccarius is... What?

21:03.472 --> 21:04.848
Oh, he's standing right behind me.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.517
Well, my children,

21:09.895 --> 21:12.773
Cassidy paints quite a vivid portrait.

21:14.650 --> 21:15.734
Who are we gonna believe?

21:15.817 --> 21:19.321
This bitter, destructive lost soul

21:19.404 --> 21:22.616
who we welcomed with open arms?

21:23.325 --> 21:27.329
In return, he brought the Catholics
right to our very doorstep.

21:27.412 --> 21:28.497
Hang on. Hang on a minute.

21:28.580 --> 21:32.000
Or your Lord who loves you,

21:32.084 --> 21:36.421
who has always and will always love you?

21:36.964 --> 21:38.882
He loves you? You're his fix.

21:38.966 --> 21:44.930
Says the junkie who hates you
almost as much as he hates himself.

21:45.013 --> 21:46.014
All right, I did.

21:46.098 --> 21:47.933
I said some harsh words
when I first got here.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.935
- That doesn't... I don't...
- Yes, what exactly

21:50.018 --> 21:52.688
did Cassidy call us when he arrived?

21:52.813 --> 21:53.814
"Idiots."

21:56.483 --> 21:58.235
"Stupid posers."

21:58.527 --> 22:01.238
An example must be made.

22:05.117 --> 22:06.493
None of youse touch me!

22:06.576 --> 22:10.747
There you are, my children.
The true maniac amongst us.

22:12.666 --> 22:15.168
An example must be made.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.965
We're innocent...
...and we're escaping together.

22:20.799 --> 22:22.759
That is God's plan...
...that is the reason we're here.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.263
I don't know about that, but...

22:32.019 --> 22:33.020
Hey.

22:33.270 --> 22:35.897
Either of you guys got a dime
or, like, a dime-like thing?

22:44.489 --> 22:45.490
Something like this?

22:46.491 --> 22:47.701
Good, Eugene.

22:47.993 --> 22:50.078
See! God has a plan.

22:51.121 --> 22:52.122
Yeah.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.754
I don't like this.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.965
I think we should just be waiting
for Rick to rescue us.

23:02.966 --> 23:03.967
Who the hell is Rick?

23:04.051 --> 23:06.595
My Reichsmarschall Rick
from Circuit Works.

23:06.678 --> 23:08.680
He and his SS shock troops should be...

23:11.058 --> 23:12.434
He said he was coming.

23:23.028 --> 23:24.154
We're gonna escape down there?

23:25.572 --> 23:26.573
Not exactly.

23:28.575 --> 23:29.785
Give me one of your buttons.

23:30.744 --> 23:31.828
But I earned these.

23:43.590 --> 23:46.885
What about the girl?
Was she with a preacher,

23:48.220 --> 23:49.596
or did she die alone?

23:50.097 --> 23:51.223
She didn't die at all.

23:52.390 --> 23:53.975
Satan told me to grab her
off the street.

23:55.894 --> 23:57.187
What about the rules?

23:58.230 --> 24:01.274
Don't be a Pollyanna.
Your deformity boy isn't dead either.

24:03.110 --> 24:05.695
It's the Wild West, cowboy. God's gone.

24:06.863 --> 24:08.198
There are no rules,

24:08.949 --> 24:11.159
not that the old ones
did your wife and kid any good.

24:27.884 --> 24:29.553
I'm gonna drop these in the drive shaft.

24:30.554 --> 24:33.723
The cuffs will anchor the chain
so it can catch on the flange yoke

24:33.807 --> 24:35.559
where the U-joint
meets the differential.

24:37.853 --> 24:39.896
Once the U-joint jams,

24:39.980 --> 24:41.898
then the crown gear will seize,

24:41.982 --> 24:44.985
and either one or both of the axles
are gonna lock.

24:46.069 --> 24:48.280
You're gonna
hear this big, loud screech,

24:48.363 --> 24:51.449
and the whole back of the bus,
it's gonna start fishtailing.

24:51.533 --> 24:55.579
We might even flip.
But once we're stopped,

24:55.662 --> 24:57.289
we're gonna have long enough
to make a run for it.

24:58.874 --> 24:59.916
That's it.

25:00.333 --> 25:01.501
How do you know all of this stuff?

25:02.752 --> 25:04.129
Foster care.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.255
Brace yourselves.

25:06.298 --> 25:07.382
Ready?

25:09.259 --> 25:11.761
One, two,

25:13.513 --> 25:14.514
three.

25:41.583 --> 25:42.584
Freeze.

25:43.335 --> 25:44.711
Oh!

25:55.180 --> 25:56.473
Humperdee?

26:10.111 --> 26:11.905
Oh!

26:16.409 --> 26:20.664
No! Don't do it!
I need a Messiah, Messiah.

26:29.839 --> 26:31.591
Oh!

26:38.014 --> 26:39.766
Humperdoo.

26:42.769 --> 26:43.770
Whoa.

26:45.021 --> 26:46.022
Oh.

26:47.691 --> 26:49.150
Oh, oh.

26:55.115 --> 26:56.574
Oh!

27:01.288 --> 27:02.622
Humperdoo.

27:02.706 --> 27:03.748
Humperdoo.

27:05.917 --> 27:06.918
Humperdoo.

27:12.841 --> 27:13.842
No!

27:16.011 --> 27:17.971
Custer, you maniac!

28:06.436 --> 28:07.771
Relax.

28:09.522 --> 28:10.940
You don't know what you've done...

28:11.024 --> 28:14.319
Stopped an apocalypse.
Two by the sounds of it.

28:15.570 --> 28:16.905
Not a bad day.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.991
Here's the last
of your "Tom/Brady" cocktail.

28:22.786 --> 28:24.829
Genesis is mine.

28:25.663 --> 28:31.378
So we find ourselves adversaries
once again, Custer.

28:32.587 --> 28:34.339
I've got a date with a mean old lady.

28:34.923 --> 28:36.091
Give her my love.

28:39.803 --> 28:41.054
One more thing.

28:44.724 --> 28:46.768
No more hats.

29:07.539 --> 29:08.623
Stop!

29:24.722 --> 29:26.057
It pains us to do this,

29:26.850 --> 29:30.186
but there's no worse offense
than to betray your own kind.

29:32.647 --> 29:33.648
It's time.

29:34.524 --> 29:35.525
Kevin, the drapes.

29:46.578 --> 29:47.662
That's embarrassing.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.248
Should we move him into the light?

29:50.331 --> 29:51.332
No.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.377
We'll let the sun come to him.

30:01.468 --> 30:02.760
Give me time to collect something.

30:04.596 --> 30:05.597
And give Cassidy

30:06.723 --> 30:09.726
more time to reflect.

30:17.901 --> 30:19.861
I'll make a lasagna.

30:31.039 --> 30:32.040
Here's an idea...

30:33.917 --> 30:34.918
We build a bomb.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.711
Rick should be here by now.

30:39.172 --> 30:41.132
I gave him directions.
Where the hell is he?

30:41.216 --> 30:42.217
Shut up!

30:42.550 --> 30:44.135
Hitler, no one is going to save you!

30:46.846 --> 30:48.014
Right, so um...

30:49.098 --> 30:50.433
We build a bomb...

30:50.517 --> 30:52.101
then we put it up against the window.

30:52.185 --> 30:53.186
and the force of it...

30:54.854 --> 30:56.731
...window explodes...we jump out.

31:13.206 --> 31:14.207
Where you going?

31:15.375 --> 31:16.417
Build a bomb.

31:19.337 --> 31:21.381
That bitch is crazy!

31:22.840 --> 31:23.841
Yeah.

31:24.717 --> 31:26.010
She's the best.

31:34.102 --> 31:35.186
Fetching, sir.

31:36.479 --> 31:38.356
Especially like the mutton chops.

31:44.487 --> 31:49.576
I feel duty-bound to inform you
of a significant lifestyle change.

31:50.785 --> 31:51.995
I'm a vampire.

31:54.789 --> 31:56.249
But I assure you,

31:56.332 --> 32:00.920
it will have no impact whatsoever on
my job performance or professionalism.

32:06.384 --> 32:07.635
I think it's on backwards.

32:18.563 --> 32:19.647
No, I was wrong.

32:21.482 --> 32:25.320
Son of a whoring bitch!

32:41.753 --> 32:43.129
So here's the thing.

32:44.505 --> 32:45.965
I have to go to the bathroom.

32:46.966 --> 32:47.967
Be my guest.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.054
Seriously though.

32:52.138 --> 32:53.556
Go ahead.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.683
You wouldn't be the first person
pissed herself on this ride.

32:58.227 --> 33:01.356
Would I be the first to call you
a dumbass leather skank?

33:03.691 --> 33:05.610
You'd be the first
and the last.

33:06.569 --> 33:07.570
What?

33:08.863 --> 33:09.906
Huh?

33:09.989 --> 33:11.658
Yeah, you better look away.

33:14.452 --> 33:15.995
I ain't scared of him.

33:17.246 --> 33:18.247
Not anymore.

33:18.331 --> 33:21.709
Not since a preacher I know
pretty much beat his sorry ass.

33:23.086 --> 33:25.588
No wonder they made you
errand boy after that mess.

33:26.214 --> 33:27.882
I'm no one's errand boy.

33:29.008 --> 33:31.302
Bus ride babysitting?

33:32.512 --> 33:34.472
Sounds like errand-boy shit to me.

33:35.848 --> 33:39.727
I'm surprised they didn't just make him
Satan's ass-wiper.

33:53.950 --> 33:54.951
Whatever she did...

33:55.034 --> 33:57.036
Mr. Saint... I'm sure she is very sorry.

34:01.791 --> 34:02.792
He's right.

34:03.710 --> 34:04.711
I...

34:05.253 --> 34:07.797
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have called you
an errand boy.

34:09.257 --> 34:11.384
I should've called you an errand bitch.

34:16.304 --> 34:17.306
Did it work?

34:20.476 --> 34:21.518
You built a bomb.

34:24.147 --> 34:25.148
Sun...

34:33.906 --> 34:36.826
They want to be vampires
and change the world,

34:36.909 --> 34:41.038
but try getting them
to pick up after themselves...

34:42.081 --> 34:44.375
Could I trouble you for a beverage?

34:44.751 --> 34:47.378
I got... I got an awful throat
on me here.

34:47.503 --> 34:48.629
Energy drink?

34:48.713 --> 34:51.382
Oh, yeah. Go on.
I could do with a caffeine bump.

34:51.466 --> 34:53.384
I've been napping
through me own crucifixion.

34:57.263 --> 34:58.306
Thank you.

34:59.307 --> 35:04.312
Oh, Mr. Cassidy. Handsome and funny,
and they all look up to you.

35:05.688 --> 35:08.775
Too bad you turned out
to be such a rotten piece of shit.

35:10.067 --> 35:12.487
Christ, you can never be
too sure about people, huh?

35:12.570 --> 35:17.533
And now here you nailed
to a pool table with tent stakes.

35:18.451 --> 35:21.204
It's just so disheartening, Mr. Cassidy.

35:22.205 --> 35:23.247
I feel the same.

35:23.706 --> 35:26.417
Well, hopefully, you'll burn quick.

35:26.834 --> 35:30.046
Although I doubt it
with all these soda spills.

35:32.715 --> 35:33.800
Mrs. Rosen?

35:36.344 --> 35:38.596
You've been very kind to me, you know?

35:39.347 --> 35:41.265
Like me dear old Granny B used to be.

35:42.141 --> 35:43.601
God rest her soul.

35:48.022 --> 35:51.526
Can I be greedy and ask
for one small act of kindness?

35:51.609 --> 35:53.820
I won't let you go, Mr. Cassidy.

35:53.903 --> 35:55.613
No, no, no, of course not.

35:57.365 --> 36:01.077
Just one last request
for a vampire condemned.

36:02.286 --> 36:03.704
You know the flown children?

36:04.580 --> 36:06.207
You have all their numbers, right?

36:06.749 --> 36:10.586
Right? Lisa, she's in Poland.

36:11.128 --> 36:12.505
You just call her up.

36:15.633 --> 36:17.343
Tell her I'm sorry. All right?

36:26.727 --> 36:28.855
Okay so, we're going
about 40 miles per hour,

36:28.938 --> 36:31.482
but there's a grass shoulder,
so when we break the window,

36:31.566 --> 36:32.900
we're gonna go out feet first.

36:32.984 --> 36:35.611
You've got to jump as far away
from the side of the bus as possible

36:35.695 --> 36:36.946
so you don't get run over.

36:38.197 --> 36:40.950
Stabbed in the back again,
just like 1918.

36:41.534 --> 36:42.910
When you're in the air,

36:42.994 --> 36:44.287
you're gonna tuck your body

36:44.370 --> 36:46.664
like you're doing a cannonball
into a swimming pool.

36:46.747 --> 36:49.083
Do not break your fall
with your arms, okay?

36:49.750 --> 36:52.753
Once you feel the ground,
you're gonna roll, roll...

36:52.837 --> 36:53.880
Get out of my way!

36:57.174 --> 36:59.635
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i> suckers!

38:40.403 --> 38:43.906
I was having the most wonderful dream.

38:44.740 --> 38:45.950
That's nice.

38:48.285 --> 38:49.912
Jody's not back yet,

38:52.456 --> 38:54.625
and there's no word from Lil' Jesse.

38:55.126 --> 38:56.419
Jesse will be here.

38:57.670 --> 38:58.754
He'll come back.

39:00.339 --> 39:01.674
He gave me his word.

39:02.842 --> 39:04.885
And you believe him, Miss Marie?

39:05.219 --> 39:08.431
Well, of course, I do.
He's coming to kill me.

39:15.187 --> 39:16.397
Thanks, fellows.

39:19.650 --> 39:21.068
Back to work.
