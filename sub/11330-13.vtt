<i>ADRIAN:Â  Previously on  The Secret
Life of the American Teenager...</i>

00:03.423 --> 00:06.455
It's a graduation party with
no parents around for 50 miles,

00:06.632 --> 00:10.110
there's gonna be drinking and
probably other illegal activities.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.244
Graduation night.

00:11.311 --> 00:13.213
Really special. No.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.549
You're gonna go after
Dante's brother? His brother?

00:15.615 --> 00:17.084
And then, the three of
us can go to the party.

00:17.150 --> 00:19.853
There's no three of us.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.556
We're gonna be taking turns
with you. We're sharing custody.

00:22.622 --> 00:23.356
You're valedictorian.

00:23.423 --> 00:26.226
No. No, thanks. I decline.

00:26.293 --> 00:29.229
And you're asking Amy to marry you.

00:29.296 --> 00:30.664
All right, I don't know
how you figured that out,

00:30.731 --> 00:32.999
but yes.

00:33.066 --> 00:33.400
There's a romance brewing all right.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.634
And I saw it with my own eyes.

00:34.701 --> 00:38.605
Between Amy's mother and my mother?

00:38.672 --> 00:40.540
My husband and I are getting a divorce.

00:40.607 --> 00:41.441
Divorce attorney. You give me a call.

00:43.910 --> 00:45.479
You know I just ruined
him for you, right?

00:45.545 --> 00:47.814
'Cause if you ever kiss him again,

00:47.881 --> 00:49.683
you're gonna be thinking about me.

00:49.750 --> 00:53.750
It's been a long time since I have
kissed Ricky, a very long time.

00:54.821 --> 00:57.891
So, I really have to kiss him again.

00:57.958 --> 01:01.294
I have to. My life depends on it.

01:01.361 --> 01:03.597
I'm terrible at this. No, you're not.

01:03.663 --> 01:05.331
You lead the team in
prayer before the game.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.967
You can do this.

01:07.034 --> 01:09.202
No, I don't, I don't
lead the team in prayer,

01:09.269 --> 01:10.737
they haven't allowed that in years.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.105
Then what are you guys
talking about in the huddle?

01:14.041 --> 01:16.376
I can't believe you
stole Madison from me

01:16.443 --> 01:17.811
and then you're still
in love with Grace.

01:17.878 --> 01:20.180
You're still in love with Grace?

01:20.247 --> 01:21.348
I'm still in love with Grace and
I've never been anywhere near her

01:21.415 --> 01:23.150
in the four years I've been here.

01:23.216 --> 01:24.818
She's a junior, she's
just been here three years.

01:24.885 --> 01:28.221
Do we have to talk about Grace
before every game, you guys?

01:28.288 --> 01:30.857
It's part of the luck now, Pappas,
we don't talk about her, then we lose.

01:30.924 --> 01:31.925
Get out there and get in the game!

01:36.296 --> 01:38.498
Huh? Focus!

01:38.565 --> 01:40.434
Why would they ask you to
say the prayer at graduation,

01:40.500 --> 01:42.369
if you can't say a prayer at graduation?

01:42.436 --> 01:45.305
I don't know. Could be that
counselor's first graduation,

01:45.372 --> 01:46.440
maybe she doesn't know.

01:46.506 --> 01:49.109
Maybe she's some kind of religious
nut who's trying to sneak it in.

01:49.176 --> 01:50.744
I don't know.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.913
I don't know anything,
including what I want to say.

01:52.979 --> 01:55.749
Which is why I wrote
something for you...

No. Ring.

05:07.213 --> 05:09.648
Maybe he saw a ring on TV.

05:09.715 --> 05:12.351
Or, he wants a ring for himself.

05:12.418 --> 05:13.986
Or, he sees that you wear rings.

anything to do with you, okay?

10:10.049 --> 10:12.284
I don't want to be rude, but I don't
want you to come anywhere near me,

10:12.351 --> 10:14.587
not now, not for the rest of my life.

10:14.653 --> 10:17.423
So, should we say an official goodbye?

10:18.390 --> 10:19.325
Bye.

10:20.059 --> 10:21.527
Hey.

10:21.594 --> 10:24.230
You're going to regret that.

10:24.296 --> 10:26.432
Especially if you're planning
to propose to Amy at graduation.

10:53.696 --> 10:56.532
It's okay, Pappas, college
will be even better.

10:57.633 --> 10:59.135
It just kind of snuck up on me.

10:59.202 --> 11:03.339
That this would be the
last day I'd be here.

11:03.406 --> 11:05.208
I loved going to school here.

11:06.409 --> 11:08.477
I love you, Coach,

11:08.544 --> 11:11.647
and I really appreciate everything you
did for me, if I haven't told you that.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.316
Good to know you feel that way.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.618
I've got some good news for you.

11:15.685 --> 11:16.485
Good news like I failed?
I'm not graduating?

11:16.552 --> 11:19.088
No, idiot. That wouldn't be good news.

11:19.155 --> 11:22.058
No, I'm going to college.

11:22.124 --> 11:23.759
Just got hired as the defensive coach.

11:26.696 --> 11:28.030
See you this summer at camp.

11:48.885 --> 11:50.520
What do you mean I can't go?

11:50.586 --> 11:52.054
I can go! I am invited.

11:52.121 --> 11:55.157
Tom, you have a family to take care of.

11:55.224 --> 11:56.859
You can't just leave and go to a party.

11:56.926 --> 11:58.728
No, I can.

11:58.794 --> 12:02.794
Rachel and the kids can
take care of themselves.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.301
But, Tom, you are not a senior.

12:05.368 --> 12:08.504
And this is a graduation
party for seniors.

12:08.571 --> 12:09.438
And you are not a graduating senior.

12:09.505 --> 12:10.706
Neither is Grace.

12:13.176 --> 12:17.980
Jack is going to give me a ride.

12:18.047 --> 12:21.684
Well, sure, Jack could give
you a ride to the party,

12:21.751 --> 12:24.253
but he's going to party
when he gets to the party,

12:24.320 --> 12:24.887
he can't just hang out with you.

12:24.954 --> 12:28.257
You mean, he can't keep an eye on me?

12:28.324 --> 12:32.061
I don't need no stinkin'
babysitter, I'm a grown ass man!

12:32.128 --> 12:33.829
Oh, yeah?

12:33.896 --> 12:35.932
Then why don't you go out to the
guest house and take care of the family

12:35.998 --> 12:38.901
that you said you wanted so badly?

12:38.968 --> 12:41.304
No party, Tom. I'm
sorry, you just can't.

12:41.370 --> 12:43.739
Why don't you go to Africa,

12:43.806 --> 12:46.843
be with your husband and
quit telling me what to do?

12:49.078 --> 12:50.613
I'm going. Geez.

13:02.225 --> 13:03.726
Forget something? Yeah.

13:04.627 --> 13:08.731
(SIGHING) I forgot that

13:08.798 --> 13:10.299
I won't be in summer school,

13:10.366 --> 13:12.935
and you will

13:13.002 --> 13:14.704
and this is the last day you and I will
be in the same school hallway together.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.008
I was headed to the butcher
shop and I saw your car.

13:19.075 --> 13:21.844
And, I just couldn't help myself.

13:25.081 --> 13:25.681
Give it up, Adrian.

13:28.084 --> 13:29.819
Give up Ricky.

13:29.886 --> 13:31.420
Not for me, but for you.

13:32.622 --> 13:34.657
I'm asking you as your friend

13:34.724 --> 13:36.259
and your soon to be ex-husband.

13:37.793 --> 13:39.395
I'm thinking about it.

13:39.462 --> 13:40.229
While you wait in the hallway,

13:40.296 --> 13:41.764
dreaming about seeing him one last time?

13:43.833 --> 13:46.802
Maybe. Adrian...

13:46.869 --> 13:49.772
(SIGHING) You and me,
we've got to move on.

13:49.839 --> 13:51.908
The two of them are gonna get married.

13:51.974 --> 13:55.378
Ricky and Amy and John are a family.

13:55.444 --> 13:57.280
And one day, you'll have a family, too.

13:57.346 --> 13:59.982
And so will I.

14:00.049 --> 14:04.320
Today's a good day to
move on. For you, too.

14:04.387 --> 14:07.223
I know you've heard the rumor
that Ricky is proposing to Amy.

14:07.290 --> 14:08.824
Yeah, I have, and well...

14:11.694 --> 14:12.662
(SIGHING) We'll see, won't we?

14:15.932 --> 14:18.234
Yeah, we will see.

14:18.301 --> 14:21.470
Come on. Bunny doesn't need me
today and we should celebrate.

14:21.537 --> 14:23.673
Celebrate what? I'm
not really graduating.

14:23.739 --> 14:26.175
Celebrate that we got through this year,

14:26.242 --> 14:26.776

whole lives ahead of us.

up John at the graduation.

Doesn't he want to see his
dad graduate? I know I do.

15:27.703 --> 15:29.539
I want to hear the speech.

15:29.605 --> 15:31.207
I have a dress here I want to get.

I'm just stopping by to get it.

Did I disturb you or something?

No.

go to the graduation with your dad.

15:50.226 --> 15:53.429
I was invited, and I'd like
to see Ricky graduate, too.

15:53.496 --> 15:54.397
Any special reason for that?

Well, he's the father of your
baby and you live with him.

15:56.632 --> 15:59.035
All right. Anything else?

16:02.371 --> 16:05.708
Never mind. I just thought
maybe he said something to you.

16:05.775 --> 16:06.843
Is something going on? I don't know.

I was looking at Nora.

a commitment. That was what it was.

What do you say? I say

despite all the times and

sure, I'm not allowed to pray.

hadn't prayed along the way for me,

weren't doing what we were supposed to

to my first day of kindergarten,

house for a whole eight hours.

was just half a day.

five-year-old, but still,

schools before I got here,

the names of all of them.

of some of the students,

you in the hallway,

learn to play drums to vent my anger,

to call social services,

who could really protect me.

24:11.298 --> 24:14.268
And then when I got here,
the first teacher I ran into

24:14.335 --> 24:16.437
was our band director, Mr. Sedlack.

I might be a fairly talented drummer,

24:26.213 --> 24:30.050
He's the guy who may have finally
cracked my head open enough

24:30.117 --> 24:32.619
that some light finally
started getting through to me

24:32.686 --> 24:35.089
as far as what all
this education was for.

24:36.390 --> 24:38.892
It's for changing the world.

24:38.959 --> 24:41.695
For making the world a better place.

24:41.762 --> 24:44.131
And that's what teachers
do, one student at a time.

24:44.198 --> 24:47.968
I am, or was, but one part

24:48.035 --> 24:49.903
of the larger group making the
music in our high school band.

24:49.970 --> 24:54.041
I am but one neighbor
making up my neighborhood.

24:54.108 --> 24:55.676
One citizen making up this country,

24:55.743 --> 24:59.079
one human being residing in the
world and trying to change it.

25:01.715 --> 25:04.752
We are all part of something
greater than ourselves.

25:04.818 --> 25:08.055
No matter how good we are, or how lousy,

25:08.122 --> 25:11.859
we are all part of humankind.

25:11.925 --> 25:13.627
And we've all experienced
the good and the not so good.

25:13.694 --> 25:16.030
(CHUCKLES)

25:16.096 --> 25:17.464
On the good side,

25:18.565 --> 25:20.567
I want to thank my parents

25:20.634 --> 25:24.638
for rescuing me from the world of
foster care and giving me a real family

25:24.705 --> 25:25.673
and a shot at life.

25:28.475 --> 25:32.212
And I want to thank my birth
mother for surviving my dad's abuse

25:32.279 --> 25:35.149
and for getting sober
and for caring for me now,

25:35.215 --> 25:37.618
because it's never too late for
a parent to care about a child.

25:40.654 --> 25:42.423
Thank you. All three of you.

25:44.224 --> 25:45.592
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

25:47.695 --> 25:51.765
And I also want to thank Mr. Boykewich,

25:51.832 --> 25:54.234
who took an interest
in me and in helping me.

25:55.369 --> 25:58.939
Thank you for my job
and for believing in me.

25:59.006 --> 26:02.176
We all have the opportunity
every day to believe in someone,

26:03.777 --> 26:06.280
to learn from someone, to love someone.

26:06.347 --> 26:10.347
Amy Juergens has taught me what I
just couldn't grasp for so many years,

26:11.318 --> 26:15.318
and never got from any book or
in any classroom, and that's this.

26:16.256 --> 26:20.461
I am capable of loving someone,
and I am capable of being loved.

26:20.527 --> 26:23.263
And now tonight, for
the first time maybe,

26:23.330 --> 26:25.866
I don't feel isolated
from the rest of you,

26:27.468 --> 26:28.769
or from the rest of the world.

26:28.836 --> 26:31.538
I feel part of you,

26:31.605 --> 26:35.409
and I feel that you
are all part of my life

26:35.476 --> 26:37.711
and together, we can
really make a difference.

26:38.379 --> 26:41.248
Amy, would you mind coming up here?

26:46.754 --> 26:47.955
(AUDIENCE WHISPERING)

26:51.658 --> 26:54.061
I'm capable of this kind
of romance, you know.

26:54.128 --> 26:55.429
If you like this sort of thing.

26:55.496 --> 26:56.864
Did you know about this?

26:56.930 --> 26:58.065
No, I did not know about this.

27:01.468 --> 27:03.370
I'm sharing this with the two of
you whether you like it or not.

27:05.506 --> 27:06.774
Oh, my God!

27:06.840 --> 27:07.675
He's going to do it.

27:08.509 --> 27:10.744
(GASPING) He's gonna do it!

27:16.884 --> 27:17.184
Amy Juergens,

27:19.553 --> 27:20.821
will you marry me?

27:20.888 --> 27:22.589

28:09.608 --> 28:12.878
They've never been to
any party before, no.

28:12.945 --> 28:14.346
I can't believe he proposed
in front of the whole class.

28:14.413 --> 28:17.216
I can. He always wins somehow.

He doesn't need a date, he can hang
with us. You can hang with us, Nick.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.828
Good.

28:29.895 --> 28:33.265
I'm new at this. At being gay.

28:33.332 --> 28:34.533
I thought you meant dancing.

29:13.038 --> 29:14.306
Do you know her?

29:14.373 --> 29:15.474
Know who?

29:15.541 --> 29:16.108
That girl over there.

29:16.175 --> 29:18.777
The one that's been staring at you.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.512
Who is she? She doesn't
go to our school.

29:22.448 --> 29:24.883
No. She doesn't go to your
school. She went to my school.

29:24.950 --> 29:27.386
My old high school. She's
still at my old high school.

29:27.453 --> 29:29.822
That's not your old girlfriend, is it?

29:29.888 --> 29:32.257
Uh... It might be.

29:32.324 --> 29:34.426
Yeah, I think it is. But I'm
dancing with you right now.

29:34.493 --> 29:36.695
Did you know she was going to be here?

29:36.762 --> 29:38.397
No, no, I didn't know
she was going to be here.

29:38.464 --> 29:40.065

you can throw your stuff.

Get a drink and something to
eat, there's plenty of food.

30:04.490 --> 30:06.759
And condoms, you know, if you get lucky.

30:06.825 --> 30:08.127
Who are all these people?

30:08.193 --> 30:10.262
Oh, neighbors. Next house over.

30:10.329 --> 30:13.198

No. I quit.

in it. I don't drink.

does have alcohol in it.

Uh, no, you weren't going to drink.

or anything. Chill. It's a party.

do at a party besides drink.

can't just leave without me.

don't care what anyone says.

But obviously you did.

36:22.968 --> 36:24.770
Wait! What is wrong with you?

36:24.837 --> 36:26.905

wouldn't sleep with you,

40:02.692 --> 40:05.362
I want to go. I need to go,
Jack. I want to go home. Now.

40:05.429 --> 40:06.096
Can you find Adrian? Yeah.

40:16.506 --> 40:18.008
Hey, I'm out of here.

40:19.242 --> 40:20.677
Wait, where you going?

40:20.744 --> 40:22.879
What do you care?

40:22.946 --> 40:25.949
If he wants to be that way, let him go.

40:30.787 --> 40:31.021
(SIGHS)

40:34.357 --> 40:37.160
Hey, Adrian. Let's go.
Grace wants to go home.

40:38.295 --> 40:40.864
(GROANING) I have a ride.

40:44.968 --> 40:48.171
No, I don't think you do, I don't
think I do. I came here with Ben.

40:48.238 --> 40:51.074
Can I have a ride? No room, sorry.

40:51.141 --> 40:52.943
You coming, Adrian? Mmm-hmm.

40:53.009 --> 40:55.278
Thanks, Henry.

40:55.345 --> 40:56.780
I just need a minute.

40:59.816 --> 41:01.151
I'm a dead man.

41:06.857 --> 41:09.092
Yeah, we'll see who
Ben is friends with now.

41:09.159 --> 41:10.427
Nice going.

41:13.029 --> 41:13.063
Uh-oh!

41:22.239 --> 41:26.443
Hey. Did you have a good time?

41:26.510 --> 41:29.079
Uh... Yeah.

41:29.146 --> 41:30.547
Best time I've ever
had without having sex.

41:30.614 --> 41:32.783
(CHUCKLING)

41:33.950 --> 41:35.085
I don't do that.

41:36.820 --> 41:37.988
Refreshing to hear.

41:43.794 --> 41:46.229
I saw you with that witch last night.

41:46.296 --> 41:47.798
Looks like she really
put a spell on you.

41:47.864 --> 41:48.598
Jealous?

41:48.665 --> 41:52.665
Do you think there's anything
to that kissing thing?

41:53.036 --> 41:55.539
Like how Adrian kissed Ricky?

41:55.605 --> 41:58.708
Do you think she could
really tell that it was over?

41:58.775 --> 41:59.109
I don't know.

42:21.465 --> 42:23.867
Oh, my God, what a crazy party.

42:26.903 --> 42:28.972
What a crazy graduation. (LAUGHING)

42:30.207 --> 42:31.641
What a crazy life.
