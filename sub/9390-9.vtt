Oh, uh, it sure was nice of you

00:43.777 --> 00:46.011
to invite us out on your yacht,
Mr. Pewterschmidt.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.045
It's not a boat.
It's a yacht.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.415
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
you said it was a boat.

00:52.685 --> 00:54.085
Wow, it's beautiful
down there.

00:54.087 --> 00:56.988
I just can't believe it
really looks like this.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.290
STEWIE: Boy, the fish tank
at day care

00:59.292 --> 01:01.459
really nailed it.

01:01.461 --> 01:03.962
Lois, are you feeling
all right?

01:03.964 --> 01:07.499
I'm just a little seasick;
that's all.

01:07.501 --> 01:08.933
(vomiting)

01:08.935 --> 01:10.368
STEWIE:
Oh, my God!

01:10.370 --> 01:12.437
(laughing):
Oh, Brian's eating it.

01:12.439 --> 01:13.938
Boy, that's a lot
of puke, Lois.

01:13.940 --> 01:16.908
I ain't seen that much puke
since my bachelor party.

01:16.910 --> 01:17.609
Your what?

01:17.611 --> 01:19.010
My bachelor party.
What's that?

01:19.012 --> 01:21.112
You don't know what
a bachelor party is?
No!

01:21.114 --> 01:22.247
When you got married,
didn't you have,

01:22.249 --> 01:24.416
like, a bachelor party
with all your friends?
My what?

01:24.418 --> 01:27.352
Oh, my God, well, we
are gonna fix that.

01:27.354 --> 01:28.887
Carter, I am gonna
throw you

01:28.889 --> 01:30.288
the best bachelor
party ever!

01:30.290 --> 01:32.290
Why would you do that?
'Cause I'm your pal

01:32.292 --> 01:35.560
and I want to help.
Like Cheeseburger Helper.

01:35.562 --> 01:36.027
Hey there, Peter.

01:36.029 --> 01:38.363
How would you like to take
a half a pound of hamburger

01:38.365 --> 01:41.499
and make a delicious meal
for the whole family?

01:41.501 --> 01:43.802
Sure!
Okay, then let's...

01:43.804 --> 01:45.403
Hold on there,
Peter!

01:45.405 --> 01:47.839
I've got something
even better!

01:47.841 --> 01:49.207
Oh, really?
You bet.

01:49.209 --> 01:52.010
How would you like to take
a half pound of hamburger

01:52.012 --> 01:54.913
and make a delicious meal
for the whole family...

01:54.915 --> 01:57.582
with cheese?

01:57.584 --> 01:58.383
What?

01:58.385 --> 01:59.484
Wha... I-I don't...

01:59.486 --> 02:00.452
I-I could just take cheese

02:00.454 --> 02:02.353
and put it on the thing
he's doing.

02:02.355 --> 02:04.456
No! It won't be
the same!

02:04.458 --> 02:05.423
Look, he's my brother.

02:05.425 --> 02:07.258
He didn't get enough
oxygen at birth.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.594
He's never gonna be quite
in step with the rest of us

02:09.596 --> 02:11.896
and this is sort of my way
of taking care of him.

02:11.898 --> 02:14.132
Well, that's nice of you,
but it was so much simpler

02:14.134 --> 02:16.134
when it was just you
and me doing our thing.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.602
I know, but just let
him have this one.

02:17.604 --> 02:20.405
Odds are he won't even come
back with the actual food.

02:20.407 --> 02:23.808
Okay, Cheeseburger Helper,
you're on.

02:23.810 --> 02:24.509
Yay!

02:24.511 --> 02:26.478
Cheese, cheese,
cheese!

02:26.480 --> 02:27.312
Yay!

02:27.314 --> 02:29.414
I'm so sorry for your burden.

02:29.416 --> 02:31.483
You're a good brother.

02:34.453 --> 02:37.021
(dance beat throbbing)

02:38.390 --> 02:40.492
So what do you think, Carter?
You having a good time?

02:40.494 --> 02:43.161
I'm not sure what I'm supposed
to do with myself.

02:43.163 --> 02:43.962
I'm very uncomfortable.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.064
Why don't you get a lap dance,
Mr. Pewterschmidt?

02:46.066 --> 02:49.334
No, Peter's Crippled Friend,
I think I'm just gonna leave.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.201
This was a stupid idea.

02:50.203 --> 02:52.403
Aw, come on, you just gotta
relax and cut loose.

02:52.405 --> 02:54.105
Like those foreign
guys over there.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.908
I can't believe
I'm back at the horse.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.376
I had many drinks last night

02:58.378 --> 03:00.545
and I was so hung out
this morning.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.247
Aw, me, too,
friend.

03:02.249 --> 03:04.983
I was blowing chinks
like crazy.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.017
Boy, this is
fun, huh?

03:06.019 --> 03:08.253
Except for the fact we gotta
sit next to that woman

03:08.255 --> 03:09.921
who came with her
co-workers.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.556
Huh, aren't we all pals?

03:11.558 --> 03:12.657
I work at the office.

03:12.659 --> 03:13.558
This is empowering.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.026
Maybe I'll get a dance, huh?

03:15.028 --> 03:17.328
You guys are probably gonna be
talking about this forever.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.597
A woman who's so cool
with all of this?

03:19.599 --> 03:20.431
Jackpot!

03:20.433 --> 03:22.433
All right, there's
a cute-looking one.

03:22.435 --> 03:23.268
Excuse me, miss?

03:23.270 --> 03:26.137
This older gentleman
would like a lap dance.

03:28.307 --> 03:29.107
What am I supposed to do?

03:29.109 --> 03:31.109
Nothing. You just sit there
and enjoy yourself.

03:31.111 --> 03:34.512
Do I, do I stick the money
directly inside of her?

03:34.514 --> 03:35.213
No, you do not.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.148
Why, have you done
that before?
(laughs)

03:37.150 --> 03:39.117
Doesn't go over.
When do I hit her?

03:39.119 --> 03:41.486
Oh, for crying out loud,
just drink this.

03:41.488 --> 03:45.290
And you, give this old bastard
the ride of his life.

03:45.292 --> 03:46.658
♪

03:46.660 --> 03:47.525
(laughing):
Yeah!

03:47.527 --> 03:49.027
All right, go, Carter!
All right!

03:49.029 --> 03:50.094
Get some! Get some!

03:50.096 --> 03:52.664
Hey, Joe, that's like
right in my (bleep) ear.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.632
Stop it! Peter, I-I...

03:54.634 --> 03:55.733
Whoa!

03:55.735 --> 03:57.468
Boy, she's bendy!

03:57.470 --> 03:59.604
(chuckles)
Wow! Y-Yes!

03:59.606 --> 04:01.506
Oh! Awesome!

04:01.508 --> 04:03.274
All right! Oh!

04:03.276 --> 04:04.676
(groaning)

04:04.678 --> 04:06.277
Oh, my God!
What's happening to him?

04:06.279 --> 04:09.080
I'm having a heart
attack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack!

04:09.082 --> 04:11.549
You ought to know by now!

04:13.719 --> 04:14.652
Oh, my God!

04:14.654 --> 04:17.388
Is my father gonna be
okay, Dr. House?

04:17.390 --> 04:19.123
He's in a coma, Mrs. Griffin.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.725
And listening to the
sound of your voice,

04:20.727 --> 04:22.393
I'd say he's the lucky one.

04:22.395 --> 04:25.964
Oh, dear, I do hope
there's something to be done.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.433
Dr. House, if you're gonna
save this patient,

04:28.435 --> 04:30.101
you'll need this.

04:31.704 --> 04:34.873
Get this thing outta my sight!

04:34.875 --> 04:35.673
But wait a second!

04:35.675 --> 04:37.308
How are you gonna
play by the rules

04:37.310 --> 04:39.110
if you don't have
the rule boo-- Oh...!

04:39.112 --> 04:42.513
My methods are a little
unorthodox, Mr. Griffin.

04:42.515 --> 04:43.581
I think I can help.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.483
What are you doing?
My job.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.652
Sometimes people fake
being in a coma.

04:47.654 --> 04:48.453
This man's not.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.521
Unless of course, the first
punch knocked him out.

04:50.523 --> 04:53.491
In which case, we won't know
for some time.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.693
<i>House.</i>
<i>Road House.</i>

04:55.695 --> 04:57.962
That, too.

04:59.698 --> 05:01.733
Any word on Carter's
condition yet?

05:01.735 --> 05:03.134
No, it's been three days

05:03.136 --> 05:05.003
and I'm really starting
to get worried.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.971
What if he's in a coma
for, like, 20 years

05:06.973 --> 05:09.240
and he comes out of the coma
and you guys are all dead,

05:09.242 --> 05:12.176
but I'm still alive and
I'm a famous race car driver,

05:12.178 --> 05:15.446
and he's like "Aw, man,
Stewie turned out awesome."

05:15.448 --> 05:17.015
And he comes to one
of my races

05:17.017 --> 05:19.350
and I'm so surprised
to see him there, I crash,

05:19.352 --> 05:21.352
and then I'm in a coma
for 20 years,

05:21.354 --> 05:23.588
and I wake up and
he's a race car driver.

05:23.590 --> 05:26.124
Stewie, do you want to
be a race car driver
when you grow up?

05:26.126 --> 05:28.526
Well, gosh, if you think
I'd be good at it.

05:28.528 --> 05:30.895
(doorbell rings)

05:31.430 --> 05:32.130
Hello, Mrs. Griffin,

05:32.132 --> 05:34.065
I'm Kenneth Gould,
Mr. Pewterschmidt's attorney.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.200
I'd like to talk to you
about a few things.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.636
As part of Mr. Pewterschmidt's
estate planning,

05:38.638 --> 05:40.104
he has left video wills

05:40.106 --> 05:43.274
applicable to a wide
variety of situations.

05:44.910 --> 05:46.210
Hello, if you're watching this,

05:46.212 --> 05:48.713
it means they didn't cut
the rope when I climaxed.

05:48.715 --> 05:50.315
As a result, I'm now dead.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.416
That's not it.

05:51.418 --> 05:52.383
If you're watching this one,

05:52.385 --> 05:54.152
it means the train wasn't
able to push the DeLorean

05:54.154 --> 05:57.555
up to 88 miles per hour
and I'm still stuck in 1885.

05:57.557 --> 05:58.756
This could
take a while.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.725
Eaten by sharks
while snorkeling...

06:00.727 --> 06:03.261
...stabbed to death
in a Toys R Us bathroom.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.530
...1940s roller skate
left in the hall.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.831
Death by chocolate.
(laughs)

06:06.833 --> 06:07.632
No, no, leave it in.

06:07.634 --> 06:10.134
Had a heart attack
and have slipped into a coma.

06:10.136 --> 06:10.635
Here we go.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.603
In that case,
I leave control of my company,

06:12.605 --> 06:15.673
Pewterschmidt Industries,
to my daughter Lois.

06:15.675 --> 06:16.441
What?!

06:16.443 --> 06:17.575
I don't know the first thing

06:17.577 --> 06:19.344
about running
a billion-dollar company.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.145
The board of directors
is fully prepared

06:21.147 --> 06:22.413
to run the company
in Carter's absence,

06:22.415 --> 06:24.415
if that's what you'd
prefer, Mrs. Griffin.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.617
Well, yes,
I think that'd be best.

06:26.619 --> 06:27.819
Well, now wait
a second, Lois.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.687
I could run the company.
You?

06:29.689 --> 06:31.856
You can't run a business
that size.

06:31.858 --> 06:33.691
You have no
experience.

06:33.693 --> 06:34.692
You know what
that is, Lois?

06:34.694 --> 06:36.427
That's you playing
by the rule book.

06:36.429 --> 06:37.695
And I don't play
by the rule book.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.764
Right, Dr. House?
Well, don't ask me.

06:39.766 --> 06:42.266
My superiors
think I'm crazy.

06:42.268 --> 06:44.068
(gibbering)

06:44.070 --> 06:45.770
Scared ya, didn't I?

06:45.772 --> 06:47.505
<i>House.</i>
<i>House.</i>

06:47.507 --> 06:50.174
And I'm gonna run
the company.

06:53.679 --> 06:55.780
Well, Lois, I'm off
to my first day

06:55.782 --> 06:56.848
as a corporate bigwig.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.816
I'm not so sure
about this, Peter.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.351
I mean, that's
Daddy's company.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.520
He spent his whole life
building it from the ground up.

07:02.522 --> 07:05.289
And you don't know
anything about running
a big business.

07:05.291 --> 07:07.258
Whoa, whoa, thanks
for the vote of confidence.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.395
Geez, you're a bigger downer
than a German bedtime story.

07:10.397 --> 07:14.499
(male narrator reading
in German accent):

07:26.178 --> 07:26.711
And in addition,

07:26.713 --> 07:29.213
Pewterschmidt Industries'
pharmaceutical division

07:29.215 --> 07:30.381
is up over 30%.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.350
Profits in new media
have doubled each quarter

07:32.352 --> 07:36.387
over the past year, and our
stock is at an all-time high.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.655
All right, stand aside.

07:37.657 --> 07:38.890
I'll take it from here.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.124
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.292
My name is Peter Griffin.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.495
I will be running the company
from hence here forth.

07:44.497 --> 07:47.231
Now, I want you all to lay
some business talk on me.

07:47.233 --> 07:47.932
I need ideas.

07:47.934 --> 07:51.269
What can we do to make
this quarter more quarterly?

07:52.404 --> 07:53.571
Well, come on, come on.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.740
(murmuring)
(coughs)

07:55.742 --> 07:57.742
Okay, I can see I'm gonna have
to get things rollin'.

07:57.744 --> 08:00.578
All right, we're gonna do an
exercise called the Idea Ball.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.280
I'm gonna toss a ball
to one of you,

08:02.282 --> 08:04.615
and whoever catches it, throw
out the first idea you got,

08:04.617 --> 08:05.783
then pass the ball
to the next guy,

08:05.785 --> 08:08.686
and he throws out an idea
and so on. Everybody clear?

08:08.688 --> 08:10.721
Yeah.
(murmuring)

08:10.723 --> 08:13.091
All right, here we go.

08:13.692 --> 08:14.792
All right, Abrams, whaddaya got?

08:14.794 --> 08:16.427
ABRAMS:
My lung's collapsing.

08:16.429 --> 08:19.363
You know what I'm hearin',
gentlemen?

08:19.365 --> 08:22.366
(sighs)
What's the best way to put this?

08:22.368 --> 08:25.670
What I'm hearing...

08:28.774 --> 08:30.675
What I'm hearing is a
lot of yesterday talk.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.511
This isn't the way we're gonna
do things under my leadership.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.446
We are gonna turn
this company around.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.381
But, sir, the company's
doing fine.

08:37.383 --> 08:38.416
Better than ever, in fact.

08:38.418 --> 08:39.317
Mr. Pewterschmidt would...

08:39.319 --> 08:41.686
I don't care what Mr.
Pewterschmidt would have done.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.587
We need to take risks.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.355
We need a complete overhaul.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.591
Gentlemen, you're all fired.

08:46.593 --> 08:47.558
(all gasp)
What?!

08:47.560 --> 08:49.727
There, now that I've got
your attention...

08:49.729 --> 08:51.462
you're all fired.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.868
Peter, what the hell
is going on?

08:56.870 --> 08:59.337
You fired everybody
at Daddy's company?!

08:59.339 --> 09:01.038
You bet.
Are you outta
your mind?!

09:01.040 --> 09:03.241
Keep it up, Lois.
I might fire you.

09:03.243 --> 09:03.841
You wouldn't.

09:03.843 --> 09:07.378
Does the name Lacey Chabert
mean anything to you?

09:07.380 --> 09:08.846
Okay, I'll behave.

09:08.848 --> 09:09.814
Yes, you will.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.215
Look, Peter,
all I'm saying is,

09:11.217 --> 09:12.817
those guys have been
with Daddy for years.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.820
How are you supposed to run
that company without them?

09:15.822 --> 09:17.288
That's it, Lois.
You're fired.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.789
Chris, you are
now Meg's mother.

09:18.791 --> 09:22.693
Ooh, Peter, your muscles
are so muscley.

09:22.695 --> 09:26.597
I am gonna plow you
so gross later.

09:28.767 --> 09:32.003
You are a team of executives
I can trust.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.838
Brian, Quagmire, Mort,

09:33.840 --> 09:34.939
you are gonna be
my creative team.

09:34.941 --> 09:37.642
You are gonna help me lead
this company into the future.

09:37.644 --> 09:39.944
Peter, we don't know
anything more than you do

09:39.946 --> 09:41.312
about running
a company.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.180
Hey, where's Joe?

09:42.182 --> 09:44.482
I think he's still
outside.

09:45.450 --> 09:47.218
Hey, Joe!
What're you doing down there?!

09:47.220 --> 09:49.987
There's no ramp!
I can't get inside!

09:49.989 --> 09:51.222
Well, we don't need him anyway.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.724
This company's gonna
make it on my ideas.

09:53.726 --> 09:55.793
Here are the products
we'll be unveiling

09:55.795 --> 09:56.894
in the new fiscal year.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.829
The African American
heart monitor.

09:58.831 --> 10:04.235
HEART MONITOR:
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.536
Aw, he dead.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.837
Jeremy Irons cereal.

10:06.839 --> 10:10.675
If you're looking for
marshmallows, there are none.

10:10.677 --> 10:13.945
It's quite bland, I assure you.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.813
And Scream in a Box.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.615
(man screaming)

10:17.617 --> 10:19.083
I needed that today.

10:19.085 --> 10:21.686
And now,
new Lady Scream in a Box.

10:21.688 --> 10:22.887
(woman screaming)

10:22.889 --> 10:26.657
Finally, a scream
that's right for me.

10:29.228 --> 10:31.395
Well, it's good to see
everyone's adapting

10:31.397 --> 10:33.264
to their new business roles.

10:33.266 --> 10:36.033
Brian, I like
your Successories.

10:38.904 --> 10:42.406
I will.
I will go get it.

10:44.776 --> 10:45.409
(knocking)

10:45.411 --> 10:47.845
Mr. Quagmire, the Davidson
account is waiting for you

10:47.847 --> 10:48.913
in the conference room.

10:48.915 --> 10:49.947
All right, thanks, Marlene.

10:49.949 --> 10:51.148
Tell 'em I'll be right in.

10:51.150 --> 10:55.453
All right, Glenn,
time to go make millions.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.488
What happened
to you, man?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.956
I grew up!
That's what happened!

10:58.958 --> 11:00.791
What happened to the
free-loving Quagmire

11:00.793 --> 11:03.494
who was banging
ten chicks at a time?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.062
I still do that.

11:05.064 --> 11:06.163
Oh. Good.
Yup.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.665
Can I have
some money?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.634
Oh, get out
of here, you bum.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.235
Ah, all right.

11:13.272 --> 11:18.342
HEART MONITOR:
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.410
He's a'ight.

11:19.412 --> 11:20.845
Daddy, you're awake!

11:20.847 --> 11:23.147
Oh, Carter,
I'm so relieved.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.615
(groans)
What happened?

11:24.617 --> 11:25.383
Where am I?

11:25.385 --> 11:27.351
Oh, you had
a heart attack, Daddy,

11:27.353 --> 11:28.886
but you're
all right now.

11:28.888 --> 11:30.121
HEART MONITOR:
Yeah, he cool.

11:30.123 --> 11:30.888
What the hell
is that?!

11:30.890 --> 11:33.024
Oh, it's an African American
heart monitor

11:33.026 --> 11:34.525
made by your company.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.059
What?!

11:35.061 --> 11:37.995
Yes, it has two settings:
Barry White and Bill Cosby.

11:37.997 --> 11:41.799
BILL COSBY HEART MONITOR:
Beep. Beep. Boop. Beep.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.100
My company makes
no such thing.

11:43.102 --> 11:45.636
Well, you see, Daddy,
when you were in a coma,

11:45.638 --> 11:48.472
Peter stepped in and took charge
of Pewterschmidt Industries.

11:48.474 --> 11:51.475
BILL COSBY HEART MONITOR:
Zibida, zoobida, gebada,
bopada, zipity, ziggita,

11:51.477 --> 11:54.779
zagata, boopada, bopada,
<i>Ghost Dad!</i>

11:56.982 --> 11:58.015
(sighs happily)

11:58.017 --> 11:59.517
Well, you made it, Peter.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.551
You're a big shot.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.586
In charge of a whole bunch
of people.

12:02.588 --> 12:05.189
Peggy, hold my calls
for a few minutes, please.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.090
PEGGY:
Yes, Mr. Griffin.

12:06.092 --> 12:09.727
Well, buddy,
you're in love with Peggy.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.695
What a mess.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.897
Griffin! Get the hell
out of my building!

12:12.899 --> 12:15.099
Holy crap, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
you're okay!

12:15.101 --> 12:16.600
You're damn right
I'm okay,

12:16.602 --> 12:19.070
and I'm here to reassume
charge of my company.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.638
Maybe I don't want to leave.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.773
Maybe I like being a fat cat.

12:22.775 --> 12:23.708
What are you saying?

12:23.710 --> 12:24.709
I'm saying it's my company now,

12:24.711 --> 12:27.645
and it's better than it ever was
when you were running it.

12:27.647 --> 12:30.014
Security, we have a situation
in the conference room.

12:30.016 --> 12:31.882
I'll give you a
situation, you fat turd.

12:31.884 --> 12:34.185
Gentlemen, please remove
this man from the building.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.721
What th...?
I'm Carter Pewterschmidt!

12:36.723 --> 12:39.023
This is my company!
Throw that guy out!

12:39.025 --> 12:40.091
Sorry,
Mr. Pewterschmidt,

12:40.093 --> 12:41.525
but we work
for Mr. Griffin now.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.127
You can't do
this to me!

12:43.129 --> 12:44.495
Do you know
who I am?!

12:44.497 --> 12:45.830
I'm Carter
Pewterschmidt!

12:45.832 --> 12:47.331
I'm not getting
in that elevator!

12:47.333 --> 12:49.133
Don't you dare throw me
out of this lobby!

12:49.135 --> 12:50.301
Don't you...
Damn it!

12:50.303 --> 12:51.969
Hey, what are you
doing out here?

12:51.971 --> 12:54.171
JOE:
I can't get
in the building!

12:54.173 --> 12:55.039
Uh, Peggy?

12:55.041 --> 12:55.873
PEGGY:
Yes, Mr. Griffin.

12:55.875 --> 12:59.543
That fart I have at 3:00--
can you push that up to now?

12:59.545 --> 13:00.778
Very good, sir.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.581
(Peter farts)

13:07.953 --> 13:10.755
Lois, how could you
let your idiot husband

13:10.757 --> 13:11.956
take over my company?

13:11.958 --> 13:13.023
He fired all my staff.

13:13.025 --> 13:15.826
His stupid ideas are bankrupting
Pewterschmidt Industries,

13:15.828 --> 13:17.528
and now he won't step down!

13:17.530 --> 13:18.529
I know, Daddy.

13:18.531 --> 13:19.497
He's become so full
of himself.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.500
He's more annoying than when
he's making his Christmas list.

13:22.502 --> 13:25.836
Now, Peter, are you sure this is
all you want for Christmas?

13:25.838 --> 13:27.772
I'm only going
to the mall once.

13:27.774 --> 13:28.773
Yeah, yeah,
that's it.

13:28.775 --> 13:32.042
MAN (on TV):
All new this Christmas--
remote control cars...

13:32.044 --> 13:34.712
that glow in the dark?!

13:39.084 --> 13:40.050
PETER:
Get that!

13:40.052 --> 13:42.119
I've run that company
for 40 years.

13:42.121 --> 13:44.622
He even froze my
corporate bank accounts.

13:44.624 --> 13:45.723
I'm broke.

13:45.725 --> 13:46.690
Oh, that's ridiculous.

13:46.692 --> 13:49.126
I'll talk to him
as soon as he gets home.

13:49.128 --> 13:50.461
(jet plane approaching)

13:50.463 --> 13:52.029
What the hell is that?!

14:03.608 --> 14:04.675
Damn it, Peter!

14:04.677 --> 14:06.811
Your plane set
my lawn on fire!

14:06.813 --> 14:08.078
Here, that ought
to cover it.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.613
Peter, I don't
want your money!

14:09.615 --> 14:12.049
Well, fine, then, have a box
of Jeremy Irons cereal.

14:12.051 --> 14:16.887
If you're looking for a prize
at the bottom, there is none.

14:16.889 --> 14:19.190
Only more cardboard.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.958
Peter, this has gone on
long enough.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.494
I want you to make things right
with Daddy.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.896
It's his company.
It's my company.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.064
It's your company.

14:27.066 --> 14:27.798
<i>Three's Company.</i>

14:27.800 --> 14:30.267
Where the kisses are hers
and hers and his.

14:30.269 --> 14:31.602
What?
I'm sorry, Lois.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.838
We all had some pot brownies
on the plane.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.073
Hey, Peter,
are you seeing this rabbit?

14:36.075 --> 14:37.041
No.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.075
Well, I sure am.

14:38.077 --> 14:38.809
You know something?

14:38.811 --> 14:42.046
You're not qualified
to sit in that chair.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.215
Oh, aren't I?

14:44.217 --> 14:45.649
(screaming)

14:45.651 --> 14:46.250
(screaming)

14:46.252 --> 14:48.686
Maybe there's a rabbit
head under here.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.087
(yelling)

14:50.089 --> 14:53.791
Peter, all of my father's assets
are tied up in that corporation.

14:53.793 --> 14:54.859
If you freeze up his money,

14:54.861 --> 14:56.360
he's not gonna have anything
to live on.

14:56.362 --> 14:59.396
Now you are gonna make amends
with Daddy, and that's final.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.198
All right, Lois, if
that's what you want.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.335
Mr. Pewterschmidt, be
in my office tomorrow
morning at 9:00.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.238
I'm sure
we can figure something out.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.840
(evil laughter)

15:09.842 --> 15:12.710
Hmm... I don't know if I like
the sound of that laugh.

15:12.712 --> 15:15.145
I knew I didn't like
the sound of that laugh.

15:15.147 --> 15:16.080
Peter, this is
unacceptable.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.649
What gives you the right
to treat me like this?

15:18.651 --> 15:19.683
You've been treating me
like crap

15:19.685 --> 15:23.387
for 20 years, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
and now I'm the one in charge.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.823
Hang on a second.

15:35.634 --> 15:37.234
Clean that up.

15:39.304 --> 15:40.604
Carter, as your boss,

15:40.606 --> 15:42.273
I command you
to have a viewing party

15:42.275 --> 15:44.208
for tonight's episode
of <i>The Big Bang Theory,</i>

15:44.210 --> 15:46.610
and you have to go cubicle
to cubicle inviting people.

15:46.612 --> 15:50.014
Aw, come on, Peter. I'm not...
I'm not good with rejection.

15:50.016 --> 15:52.516
I'm your boss.
Now do it!

15:53.952 --> 15:56.654
Hi. I was gonna catch
The Big Bang Theory tonight,

15:56.656 --> 15:59.356
and wondered if you wanted
to come over and watch.

15:59.358 --> 16:00.958
Wha... What?
What is that?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.860
It's a comedy.
It's on CBS.

16:02.862 --> 16:03.861
I'm really into it.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.029
I don't want
to watch that.

16:05.031 --> 16:06.764
I don't want to
watch it with you.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.333
All right, if you change
your mind, here's a flyer.

16:09.335 --> 16:10.601
If you do decide to come,

16:10.603 --> 16:12.736
I'm just asking
that you bring an appetizer.

16:12.738 --> 16:13.837
Yeah, I'm not
gonna do that.

16:13.839 --> 16:15.973
See, Peter, I told you,
no one wants to come.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.975
This is awful.
You're not
off the hook.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.110
You still got
to have that party.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.013
Babs, you want to
sit and watch...?

16:23.015 --> 16:23.981
No.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.884
I'll have you know
that I can bench press

16:26.886 --> 16:28.852
over 690 billion nanograms.

16:28.854 --> 16:30.821
Sheldon, that's less
than two pounds.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.223
It sounded better
the way I said it.

16:33.225 --> 16:34.358
(laughs)

16:34.360 --> 16:37.227
Oh, when I tell that joke
at work tomorrow, people...

16:37.229 --> 16:39.430
people-people are gonna
be sorry they didn't come.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.231
They're-They're gonna...
This-This was...

16:41.233 --> 16:43.167
This-This was a good night.

16:45.036 --> 16:46.737
Carter, as your boss,
I'm ordering you

16:46.739 --> 16:50.641
to pay a compliment to this
sharply-dressed Asian man.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.076
You look very nice.

16:52.078 --> 16:53.077
What else?

16:53.079 --> 16:54.378
Uh...
What about my shoe?

16:54.380 --> 16:55.379
They're nice, too.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.348
How you think
my house smell?

16:57.350 --> 16:58.749
Not oniony?

16:58.751 --> 16:59.416
You good man.

16:59.418 --> 17:03.687
I pat you on the head
and feed you from the hand.

17:07.659 --> 17:10.194
(crying):
And then he made me
clean out the fridge

17:10.196 --> 17:13.263
in the employee lounge, and
the employees were mad at me

17:13.265 --> 17:15.866
because I-I threw out food
that they still wanted.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.401
I don't know
what's in there!

17:17.403 --> 17:18.235
Oh, that's it.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.937
Peter is completely
out of control.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.206
We've got to do something
to take him down

17:22.208 --> 17:23.941
and get your company back.

17:23.943 --> 17:25.142
Right, right. But how?

17:25.144 --> 17:26.243
In order to oust an idiot,

17:26.245 --> 17:28.445
we've got to think
like an idiot.

17:28.447 --> 17:29.780
Let's see.

17:29.782 --> 17:30.948
What's Peter's weakness?

17:30.950 --> 17:33.651
He's got to have a weakness.

17:34.619 --> 17:35.853
Swamp monsters.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.989
Swamp monsters, of course!

17:42.060 --> 17:43.394
Lois, what are you doing here?

17:43.396 --> 17:45.462
Oh, I just wanted to make
sure everything was okay.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.698
Of course it's okay.
Why wouldn't it be?

17:47.700 --> 17:50.134
Oh, you know, that whole
swamp monster story.

17:50.136 --> 17:50.901
Swamp monster?

17:50.903 --> 17:52.803
You haven't heard?
Heard what?

17:52.805 --> 17:54.905
Oh, I'm sure
it's nothing.

17:54.907 --> 17:55.873
It's just, apparently,

17:55.875 --> 17:57.408
somebody flushed a
baby swamp monster

17:57.410 --> 17:59.743
down the toilet somewhere,
not far from here.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.713
What?! Who would flush
a baby swamp monster?

18:02.715 --> 18:04.214
Don't they know
what would happen?

18:04.216 --> 18:06.250
Well, apparently,
it has happened.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.284
And now it's grown up

18:07.286 --> 18:09.820
and is attacking
important businessmen.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.321
I'm an important
businessman!

18:11.323 --> 18:13.991
(faint deep growling)

18:13.993 --> 18:15.025
What the hell was that?!

18:15.027 --> 18:17.094
It sounds like maybe
a swamp monster

18:17.096 --> 18:19.263
who needs to project
a little more.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.231
(louder deep growling)

18:21.233 --> 18:23.901
(roaring)

18:23.903 --> 18:25.135
Ah, crap!

18:25.137 --> 18:26.036
(roaring)

18:26.038 --> 18:27.438
Aah! A swamp monster!

18:27.440 --> 18:30.040
(roaring)
(screaming)

18:30.042 --> 18:31.241
Quick, Peter, sign
this legal document

18:31.243 --> 18:34.078
giving the company
back to Daddy so you
won't get eaten!

18:34.080 --> 18:36.880
Oh, I don't understand,
but nothing makes sense

18:36.882 --> 18:38.482
in these swamp monster times.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.084
(screaming)

18:40.086 --> 18:41.018
We did it, Daddy.

18:41.020 --> 18:44.221
I have my husband back,
and you have your company.

18:44.223 --> 18:45.622
Sorry I'm
late, Lois.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.624
Okay, are we doing
the swamp monster thing?

18:47.626 --> 18:51.261
Wait, if you're Daddy,
then who...?

18:51.263 --> 18:55.432
BOTH:
S-S-S-S-S-S-S...
Swamp monster!

18:57.936 --> 19:01.138
("Scooby Doo"-like
chase music playing)

19:20.592 --> 19:23.460
Now let's find out
who you really are.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.162
(gasps)
(gasps)

19:25.164 --> 19:26.163
Dr. House?!

19:26.165 --> 19:26.897
Indeed, Lois.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.966
And if you don't mind,
I'll address you

19:28.968 --> 19:30.000
in my natural speaking voice,

19:30.002 --> 19:33.137
as I've grown so weary
of doing an American accent.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.004
Do you want to come

19:34.006 --> 19:35.639
to my <i>Big Bang</i>
<i>viewing party next week?</i>

19:35.641 --> 19:37.841
Daddy, you don't have
to do that anymore.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.544
I know, I know.
I-I... I like it now.

19:42.213 --> 19:44.481
Well, I'm sorry
you lost the company, Peter,

19:44.483 --> 19:46.250
but I think it's for the best.

19:46.252 --> 19:48.385
You were turning
into a real jerk.

19:48.387 --> 19:49.219
Well, maybe so.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.955
But I sure am gonna miss
being a corporate big shot.

19:51.957 --> 19:55.826
Well, you'll always be a big
shot in this family, sweetheart.

19:55.828 --> 19:56.960
Thanks, honey.

19:56.962 --> 19:59.163
And I got a little
surprise for you.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.464
In that contract
you signed,

20:00.466 --> 20:02.900
you got to keep
the corporate plane.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.269
(gasps)
Yeah!

20:08.273 --> 20:09.840
Peter, how are
you doing that?

20:09.842 --> 20:11.208
I-I don't...
I don't know, Lois.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.477
I'm scared.
Well, come down.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.379
I can't. I-I...
Get help.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.346
Call somebody.

20:16.348 --> 20:17.114
Wh-Wh-Who do I call?

20:17.116 --> 20:20.484
I-I don't know. A police...
a fireman... a scientist!

20:20.486 --> 20:21.285
Call a scientist!

20:21.287 --> 20:23.253
Okay, you kids stay here
with your father.

20:23.255 --> 20:25.956
I'm gonna go find
a scientist.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.559
Am I gonna die?
