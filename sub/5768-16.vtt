WEBVTT

00:01.730 --> 00:03.129
Previously on The Good Wife...

00:03.170 --> 00:04.626
Lemond Bishop, you're
under arrest for murder.

00:07.100 --> 00:08.362
It's about your
legit businesses.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.163
A confidential informant?

00:10.210 --> 00:11.336
KALINDA:
Yeah, you're accused of killing

00:11.370 --> 00:15.079
a confidential informant
at one of your health clubs.

00:20.450 --> 00:23.510
*

00:28.790 --> 00:31.258
* Lucy, Lucy

00:31.290 --> 00:33.520
* Look what you done

00:33.560 --> 00:38.293
* You brought that boy
just to watch me cry *

00:38.330 --> 00:42.699
* And I'm blue, blue, blue

00:42.740 --> 00:44.731
* Without you...

00:45.770 --> 00:48.409
DIANE:
All those opposed?

00:48.440 --> 00:49.475
The proposal passes.

00:49.510 --> 00:52.445
Next on the agenda, Will...

00:52.480 --> 00:54.573
I ask for a show
of hands to formalize

00:54.620 --> 00:57.544
the appointment of equity
partner, Alicia Florrick,

00:57.590 --> 00:58.488
_ to the _
steering committee.

00:58.520 --> 01:00.215
All those in favor?

01:00.260 --> 01:02.558
Great, welcome, Alicia.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.789
I think you
have an agenda.

01:05.830 --> 01:07.798
I do, thank you.
Can we talk
about money now?

01:07.830 --> 01:08.990
Yes.
(sighs)

01:09.030 --> 01:13.296
David proposes reacquiring
the 27th and the 29th floors.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.262
It's time we_ look like
a real law fIrm again

01:15.300 --> 01:17.109
and not some
Burmese tent City.

01:17.140 --> 01:19.529
I would only argue that we not
make the same mistake

01:19.580 --> 01:20.774
we made at the beginning
of the downturn.

01:20.810 --> 01:22.471
We overspent
and regretted it.

01:22.510 --> 01:24.205
WILL:
Yes, but in my opinion

01:24.250 --> 01:25.376
we're living
in a new economy

01:25.410 --> 01:26.638
and there's as
much danger of us

01:26.680 --> 01:28.477
being too conservative
with our finances.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.545
And what might be the danger
of being too conservative?

01:30.590 --> 01:31.614
Oh, no,
Mommy and Daddy are fighting.

01:31.650 --> 01:32.753
Look, we're one of the few

01:32.790 --> 01:34.257
all-service firms left standing,

01:34.290 --> 01:35.484
and if we don't expand,
our clients will leave us

01:35.520 --> 01:36.623
for someone who will.

01:36.660 --> 01:37.684
But they haven't
up to this point.

01:37.730 --> 01:38.685
Because the economy
has scared them.

01:38.730 --> 01:40.220
(overlapping chatter)

01:40.260 --> 01:42.467
DAVID:
Okay, no more speeches.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.663
I propose we lease back
the 27th and the 29th floor

01:45.700 --> 01:46.598
before they're snatched up.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.507
And I propose that
if this motion fails,

01:49.540 --> 01:52.407
we study the economic impact
in a subcommittee.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.408
Oh, yes, by all means,
form another subcommittee.

01:54.440 --> 01:55.475
DIAl\lE:
Everyone In favor

01:55.510 --> 01:59.276
of David Lee's proposal,
please raise their hands.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.639
DAVID:
Come on, Debbie,

02:00.680 --> 02:02.511
stop sucking up to Diane.

02:02.550 --> 02:03.687
All those opposed?

02:04.920 --> 02:08.617
All right, six for
and six against.

02:08.660 --> 02:09.888
You are kidding me.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.579
Will, do you mind heading up
the subcommittee

02:11.630 --> 02:12.722
to study the economic impact

02:12.760 --> 02:14.523
of leasing these
new floors?

02:14.560 --> 02:15.492
I don't mind.
Good.

02:15.530 --> 02:16.622
So, one more matter:

02:16.670 --> 02:20.265
there seems to _be some concern
about our Investigator.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.768
With the influx
of new busrness,

02:22.810 --> 02:24.562
there's a feeling
that she is being overtaxed.

02:24.610 --> 02:26.237
I propose we hire
a new investigator.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.304
To work with Kalinda?

02:27.340 --> 02:29.604
DAVID:
I don't care,

02:29.650 --> 02:32.175
I just want it done.
Yes, someone to work
with Kalinda.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.575
_ When we hired a second
Investigator a few years ago,

02:34.620 --> 02:35.769
it didn't work out so well.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.549
Oh, my God, she's right.

02:37.590 --> 02:38.409
What were we thinking?

02:38.450 --> 02:40.259
DIANE:
Well, I think
we can find

02:40.290 --> 02:41.314
a better fit than Blake.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.624
_ _ All those in_favor_
of hiring a second Investigator?

02:46.400 --> 02:48.618
Yes, be brave,
lone voice in the wilderness.

02:48.660 --> 02:50.264
DIANE:
Good, I will form
a subcommittee

02:50.300 --> 02:51.665
for hiring, and
with that...

02:51.700 --> 02:54.635
No new business,
I'm out of here.

02:54.670 --> 02:56.558
Diane.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.259
Could I be on
that subcommittee?

02:58.310 --> 03:00.505
Well, I know you're
friends with Kalinda.

03:00.540 --> 03:03.247
But you're
an equity partner now.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.373
Your loyalty has
to be with the firm.
I know.

03:05.410 --> 03:06.342
You cannot
tell her anything.
I know.

03:06.380 --> 03:07.540
Confidentiality rules.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.844
But certainly you can
join the subcommittee.
Thank you.

03:09.890 --> 03:13.189
I think you're late
for court, aren't you?
Oh.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.450
WOMAN:
Alicia.

03:17.860 --> 03:18.724
Liz?

03:18.760 --> 03:19.829
Yeah, yeah.

03:19.860 --> 03:21.259
I haven't seen you since school.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.495
Look at you, you look
exactly the same.

03:23.530 --> 03:24.690
So do you, wow.

03:24.730 --> 03:26.266
And, uh,
we're on opposite sides again,

03:26.300 --> 03:27.335
just like school.

03:27.370 --> 03:28.394
Good guys, bad guys.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.806
Well...
(chuckles)

03:30.840 --> 03:33.809
All right, I'll,
uh, see you inside.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.308
Okay.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.806
Who's that?

03:37.850 --> 03:38.839
Liz Lawrence.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.814
My nemesis
in law school.

03:40.850 --> 03:43.318
Is she good?

03:43.350 --> 03:44.612
Yes.

03:44.650 --> 03:45.480
_ LIZ:
Mr. Bishop's comfort level

03:45.520 --> 03:46.384
should not be our
concern, Your Honor.

03:46.420 --> 03:47.717
ALICIA:
This is not about our client's

03:47.760 --> 03:48.852
comfort level, Your Honor.

03:48.890 --> 03:50.289
This is about his
eight-year-old son

03:50.330 --> 03:52.298
who he has not seen
Since his arrest.

03:52.330 --> 03:53.399
Then, Mr. Bishop
shouldn't have killed

03:53.430 --> 03:54.328
_ one of our
confidential informants.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.567
Excuse me,
Mr. Bishop did not kill anyone.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.568
We have evidence
that the

03:58.600 --> 04:00.864
conﬁdenﬁal
informant's boyfriend, Noah,

04:00.900 --> 04:03.869
physically abused her
on dozens of occasions.
And where is this evidence?

04:03.910 --> 04:05.969
We've been hearing about this
boyfriend for months now.

04:06.010 --> 04:08.501
We are prepared to present
this evidence, Your Honor.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.043
But once again
the AUSA is simply attempting

04:11.080 --> 04:12.672
to punish our client...
Mrs. Florrick is misinformed.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.369
I'm attempting to prevent
their client from fleeing.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.409
JUDGE:
Thank you, counselors.

04:17.350 --> 04:19.784
Counselors.

04:19.820 --> 04:22.357
Mr. Bishop will be
remanded into the custody

04:22.390 --> 04:24.585
of a U.S. marshal
and permitted to visit his son

04:24.630 --> 04:27.622
outside of prison
two hours every week.

04:27.660 --> 04:28.752
(gavelbangs)

04:30.370 --> 04:33.396
Even in law school,
I always let you win one.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.668
Oh, is that what that was?

04:36.070 --> 04:38.959
Kalinda found the CPS
boyfriend, Noah.
Good.

04:39.010 --> 04:40.671
What did he say?
She found him in the morgue.

04:40.710 --> 04:42.940
He heard the police
were looking for him

04:42.980 --> 04:45.505
and shot himself
in the head.

04:45.550 --> 04:46.744
Did he leave
a suicide note?

04:46.780 --> 04:48.338
She's checking.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.348
We can still point to him
as the most likely suspect.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.858
We have the police reports
on Noah's abusiveness.

04:52.890 --> 04:55.552
And we have witnesses
who saw him fleeing the murder.

04:55.590 --> 04:56.750
Yeah, but the
boyfriend's dead.

04:56.790 --> 04:57.984
BOY:
Hey, Dad,

04:58.030 --> 04:59.759
watch this.

05:01.660 --> 05:04.766
Derrick Rose better
watch his back.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.564
Judy, could you give me
a second with Mrs. Florrick?

05:07.600 --> 05:08.692
Uh, sure.

05:08.740 --> 05:09.707
Do you need anything?

05:09.740 --> 05:10.707
No, I'm good.

05:10.740 --> 05:13.470
Thanks, sis.

05:14.540 --> 05:17.441
We still have the testimony
backing up your alibi.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.846
My sister's
testimony, yeah.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.917
They'll think she's
lying to protect me.

05:22.950 --> 05:24.349
They want to get me.

05:28.890 --> 05:31.586
There's a lavwer I know.

05:31.630 --> 05:33.029
Charles Lester.

05:34.060 --> 05:36.028
I want you to
take him with you.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.736
Mr. Bishop,
if you're unhappy

05:41.770 --> 05:43.135
with your representation...
Stop it.

05:43.170 --> 05:46.333
What I want is for you to
work with Charles Lester.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.568
BOY:
Dad, come on.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.614
Can you believe it?

05:55.650 --> 05:57.413
They might convict me

05:57.450 --> 05:58.917
for the one thing I didn't do.

06:05.830 --> 06:06.797
Need something to do?

06:06.830 --> 06:07.797
No, I seem to have a

06:07.830 --> 06:09.798
subcommittee to head up.

06:09.830 --> 06:10.967
It's nice of you
to volunteer.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.060
Actually, I think
I was volunteered.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.067
What's going on?

06:15.100 --> 06:17.034
We're six to six.

06:17.070 --> 06:19.106
Looking into
the economic impact.

06:19.140 --> 06:20.107
No, you're filibustering.

06:22.140 --> 06:24.608
We escaped
the executioner, Will.

06:24.650 --> 06:25.742
Barely.

06:25.780 --> 06:27.509
We were broke.

06:27.550 --> 06:28.744
Now that we have some reserves,

06:28.780 --> 06:29.849
why are we so anxious
to spend them?

06:29.890 --> 06:30.982
WILL:
Because we need to grow.

06:31.020 --> 06:33.011
We need to hire and add offices.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.015
And end up
right where we started?

06:34.060 --> 06:35.709
No, you were the one who
wanted to open an office

06:35.760 --> 06:36.954
in New York
and go after Canning's firm.

06:36.990 --> 06:38.457
Yes, I was angry.

06:38.490 --> 06:39.320
Well, get angry again.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.521
We are responsible
for 300 employees.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.529
We aren't rebels,
we're not gamblers.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.502
Wait.

06:51.540 --> 06:53.679
What?

06:53.710 --> 06:56.440
Stern said that when you have
a partnership disagreement,

06:56.480 --> 06:57.845
youlook
at your mission statement.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.440
What mission statement?

07:00.480 --> 07:01.947
Exactly.

07:01.980 --> 07:03.584
You guys are great.

07:03.620 --> 07:06.555
Just keep it up.

07:06.590 --> 07:07.682
Cheers.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.621
OTHERS:
Cheers.

07:10.660 --> 07:12.696
KALINDA:
That's the CI,
Christina Diaz,

07:12.730 --> 07:14.698
three months
before she was murdered.

07:14.730 --> 07:15.992
The one Bishop said
he never met.

07:16.030 --> 07:17.895
(sighs)

07:17.930 --> 07:19.795
Things just
keep getting worse.

07:19.840 --> 07:20.738
Where'd you find it?

07:20.770 --> 07:21.862
One of the gym workers.

07:21.900 --> 07:22.901
They were having a celebration

07:22.940 --> 07:24.635
for the most membership sales.

07:24.670 --> 07:26.729
He taped it.
Do the feds
know about it?

07:26.780 --> 07:28.077
The tape?
No, not yet.

07:28.110 --> 07:31.648
We can't destroy it.
I know, but we don't need

07:31.680 --> 07:33.045
to tell them that it exists.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.969
This is just a copy.
Yeah, they'll just find it
anyway, won't they?

07:36.020 --> 07:37.942
(phone ringing)
Well, sometimes they're
not as good at their jobs.

07:37.990 --> 07:40.857
(chuckles)

07:40.890 --> 07:42.528
Yeah.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.619
Okay.

07:44.660 --> 07:47.254
Need to go meet
our new cocounsel.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.824
Cocounsel?

07:51.730 --> 07:53.231
You heard?

07:53.270 --> 07:55.158
Yes,
Charles Lester is here.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.667
This should be interesting.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.735
What does Mr. Bishop's
personal lavwer look like?

07:58.770 --> 07:59.976
Yeah.

08:01.880 --> 08:02.847
Mr. Lester.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.973
MAN:
Yes.

08:06.550 --> 08:08.939
Mr. Charles Lester?

08:08.980 --> 08:10.288
Yes.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.584
And you're...

08:12.620 --> 08:14.019
Alicia Florrick.
(chuckles)

08:14.060 --> 08:16.654
And Cary Agos.

08:16.690 --> 08:17.952
Yes.
(chuckles)

08:17.990 --> 08:19.855
Well, you're not
at all what I expected.

08:19.900 --> 08:20.559
Really?

08:20.600 --> 08:23.023
No, you both look much younger.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.094
Oh, well, that's nice.

08:24.130 --> 08:25.995
Should we get going
on these witness interviews?

08:26.030 --> 08:27.998
Yes, I think first

08:28.040 --> 08:29.860
we're going to go
and see, um...

08:29.910 --> 08:31.537
Ike Kramer.

08:31.570 --> 08:34.130
Uh, no, 1-1...

08:34.180 --> 08:35.772
(sighs)

08:35.810 --> 08:37.038
Don't you hate it when
you write something

08:37.080 --> 08:39.298
down on a piece of
paper and then...

08:39.350 --> 08:40.908
Oh, thanks.

08:40.950 --> 08:42.178
Ike Kramer.

08:42.220 --> 08:45.986
He's a, uh, trainer at, uh,
one of Mr. Bishop's gymnasiums.

08:46.020 --> 08:47.578
Oh, good,
so you have the address?

08:47.620 --> 08:48.689
Yes, I do.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.256
Wsumm

08:50.290 --> 08:53.020
it's over on, um...

08:54.930 --> 08:55.897
I already talked to the feds.

08:55.930 --> 08:56.726
CARY:
Yeah, we know.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.692
Just, just tell us
what you told them.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.902
Look, I'm not trying
to hurt Mr. Bishop,

09:04.940 --> 09:06.771
I'm just trying
to tell the truth.

09:06.810 --> 09:08.004
He had us in a meeting.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.769
He told us that
if he caught anyone skimming,

09:09.810 --> 09:10.845
he would kill them.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.006
ALICIA:
Those were
his exact words?

09:12.050 --> 09:13.574
He would kill them?

09:13.620 --> 09:15.918
Not get rid of
in the sense of fire?

09:15.950 --> 09:20.080
No, look, we all knew
Christina was skimming.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.815
Bishop didn't know she was a CI.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.782
None of us did.

09:23.830 --> 09:24.888
But I think
he killed her

09:24.930 --> 09:26.352
because she was skimming.

09:26.390 --> 09:27.755
Couldn't he have been
using the work jokingly?

09:27.800 --> 09:28.789
Well, no one laughed.

09:28.830 --> 09:30.127
I mean, I like Mr. Bishop a lot,

09:30.170 --> 09:31.194
but he has a...

09:31.230 --> 09:32.299
serious side.

09:32.330 --> 09:35.197
Okay.

09:35.240 --> 09:38.164
Mr. Lester, do you
have any questions?

09:38.210 --> 09:39.199
Uh, yes.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.969
Uh, just a second.

09:41.010 --> 09:42.034
There we go.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.945
What are
the hours here?

09:46.210 --> 09:47.871
8:00 am. to
10:00 pm.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.718
Huh, 8:00 to 10:00--
that's pretty standard?

09:50.750 --> 09:52.718
Yes.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.113
And what is that?

09:54.160 --> 09:55.218
That over there.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.353
It's a chart about body weight.

09:57.390 --> 09:59.995
Really, and you're
interested in body weight?

10:00.030 --> 10:03.864
Yes... I... am.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.197
Okay, good.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.219
That's it for me.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.037
CARY:
That's-- no more questions?

10:10.070 --> 10:11.002
Uh, no.

10:14.240 --> 10:15.969
WILL:
We have a problem.

10:16.010 --> 10:17.341
DIANE:
We'd rather keep this
conﬁdenﬁaL

10:17.380 --> 10:19.200
You know our client,
Seth De Luca?

10:19.250 --> 10:20.410
The restaurateur?

10:20.450 --> 10:21.747
Exactly.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.748
He was one of
Stern's first clients.

10:23.790 --> 10:24.916
Eight years with us.

10:24.950 --> 10:26.019
Okay, what's wrong?

10:26.050 --> 10:27.017
He paid his bill on time.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.021
In full?

10:30.060 --> 10:31.084
Down to the cent.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.757
You think he's leaving?

10:32.800 --> 10:33.755
WILL:
That's the word.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.051
Just check and see if
he's meeting other firms.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.294
We don't want
to lose old clients

10:36.330 --> 10:37.194
while we're pursuing new ones.

10:37.230 --> 10:39.664
I'm on it.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.065
DIANE:
You saw, uh,

10:41.100 --> 10:43.102
Thao, Crowne & Associates
went bankrupt?

10:43.140 --> 10:44.164
Yeah, I did.

10:44.210 --> 10:45.939
Any friends there out of work?

10:45.970 --> 10:46.971
A few-- two investigators.

10:47.010 --> 10:48.079
Why?

10:48.110 --> 10:49.179
Oh, no reason.

10:49.210 --> 10:50.199
Thank you.

10:51.910 --> 10:53.946
LIZ:
Your Honor, this is merely
a preliminary hearing.

10:53.980 --> 10:56.073
ALICIA:
If there isn't
enough evidence,

10:56.120 --> 10:57.815
Mr. Bishop
should be free.

10:57.850 --> 10:59.112
The defense is trying to
get two cracks at bat:

10:59.150 --> 11:00.151
here, during this
hearing, and then again

11:00.190 --> 11:01.817
during trial.
Your Honor,

11:01.860 --> 11:03.020
the prosecution is shirking...
Let them cross-examine

11:03.060 --> 11:04.982
dunng
_ the tria_l.__ _
...its responSIbilities.

11:05.030 --> 11:07.351
LIZ: They will have
plenty of time...
Counsel... Counselors!

11:07.400 --> 11:09.766
Question your witness,
Ms. Lawrence.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.290
Show me there's
enough to prosecute.

11:11.330 --> 11:12.866
Thank you,
Your Honor.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.197
Mr. Kramer, thank you for
making yourself available.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.128
Don't worry. We're
gonna lose here,

11:16.170 --> 11:17.398
but it will prepare
us for trial, okay?

11:17.440 --> 11:19.067
Mr. Kramer, you work
at Mr. Bishop's gym

11:19.110 --> 11:20.008
Fine Fitness?

11:20.040 --> 11:21.803
Yes, I'm a trainer there.
Now, Mr. Kramer,

11:21.840 --> 11:24.479
you heard Mr. Bishop
make a pronouncement

11:24.510 --> 11:26.046
about skimming
in one of his meetings,

11:26.080 --> 11:27.047
didn't you?

11:27.080 --> 11:28.047
Yeah.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.184
And what was
that pronouncement?

11:30.220 --> 11:32.211
That he wouldn't tolerate
anybody skimming.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.217
And didn't
he say

11:33.260 --> 11:34.818
that he would murder anybody

11:34.860 --> 11:35.815
caught skimming?

11:35.860 --> 11:37.225
No.

11:37.260 --> 11:38.887
LIZ:
I...

11:38.930 --> 11:40.227
He didn't?

11:40.260 --> 11:41.227
I'm sorry.

11:41.260 --> 11:42.352
Did he say
that he would

11:42.400 --> 11:43.992
kill anybody
caught skimming?

11:44.030 --> 11:45.497
KRAMER:
No.

11:45.530 --> 11:46.758
LIZ:
Uh...

11:46.800 --> 11:48.336
You told our investigators
he did.

11:48.370 --> 11:49.337
No.

11:49.370 --> 11:51.008
I said Mr. Bishop said

11:51.040 --> 11:53.235
that he would "get rid of"
anybody he caught skimming.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.736
And by that he meant "kill."

11:54.780 --> 11:55.735
No. He meant "fire."

11:57.280 --> 11:58.872
LIZ:
Uh, Your Honor, uh...

11:58.910 --> 12:00.070
we need sometime
to discuss this.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.348
Sure, but we immediately request

12:01.380 --> 12:03.780
a dismissal, Your Honor.
Your Honor, the witness

12:03.820 --> 12:05.117
is changing
his tune...
Absent that, we
ask for bail.

12:05.150 --> 12:07.209
There isn't enough
sufficient evidence...

12:07.260 --> 12:09.785
(overlapping chatter)

12:09.830 --> 12:10.979
Please, that's enough.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.291
Huh.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.463
So what happened there?

12:17.500 --> 12:19.195
Witness recanted.
Yes...

12:19.230 --> 12:20.959
but why?
Oh, I have
noidea.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.092
Maybe we intimidated him.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.108
(both laugh)

12:24.140 --> 12:26.062
I mean, who else?
It was just us.

12:26.110 --> 12:27.270
LESTER:
Hi.

12:27.310 --> 12:29.949
Say, could I take a gander

12:29.980 --> 12:30.947
at the other evidence

12:30.980 --> 12:32.345
against
Mr. Bishop?

12:32.380 --> 12:34.245
I heard there
was a Videotape

12:34.280 --> 12:35.941
that could be a bit damaging.

12:51.970 --> 12:53.528
22 years on the force,
got my pension.

12:53.570 --> 12:56.061
Since then I've been doing
freelance investigative work.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.067
Thank you,
Sergeant.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.533
Please...
Wait.

12:59.570 --> 13:00.832
Good old Walt.

13:00.880 --> 13:01.699
Walt.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.503
And so you're currently
ready to work?

13:03.550 --> 13:05.040
Am I currently
ready? Yeah.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.275
I got my coffee thermos
right here.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.276
Any more
questions?

13:09.320 --> 13:11.379
Yes. Um, Walt, do you
have much experience

13:11.420 --> 13:12.444
working with women?

13:12.490 --> 13:14.549
Oh, sure.
ALICIA: And how do
you feel about working

13:14.590 --> 13:15.579
with a female investigator?

13:15.620 --> 13:17.326
WA|__T:
No complaints here.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.783
I love the ladies,
and the ladies love me.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.966
RECEPTIONIST:
Sergeant Wilkins,

13:25.000 --> 13:26.991
they're almost ready for you.

13:30.270 --> 13:32.135
Am I being replaced?

13:39.050 --> 13:40.574
No.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.611
There are three ex-cops
in Reception.
Really?

13:42.650 --> 13:44.811
And how do you know
they're ex-cops?

13:45.890 --> 13:47.949
You're not being replaced.

13:47.990 --> 13:49.878
You're interviewing
investigators.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.329
Why would you be
interviewing investigators,

13:51.360 --> 13:53.294
UH...

13:53.330 --> 13:54.922
unless you want a second one?

13:54.960 --> 13:55.927
Yes.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.621
We're expanding your department.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.864
My department?
Yes.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.060
You're a department now.

14:00.100 --> 14:00.896
Congratulations.

14:00.940 --> 14:03.101
The Office of
Legal Investigators.

14:03.140 --> 14:05.062
I don't have a desk
but I have a department?

14:05.110 --> 14:06.134
We'll get you a desk.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.899
And how you doing with
our wayward restaurateur?

14:07.940 --> 14:09.578
Any reason why
he paid on time?

14:09.610 --> 14:12.147
So this other investigator...

14:12.180 --> 14:14.239
the second investigator.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.247
He'll work under me?

14:15.280 --> 14:16.349
Not necessarily.

14:16.380 --> 14:17.881
So you're expanding
my department,

14:17.920 --> 14:19.547
but I'm not the head
of my department?

14:19.590 --> 14:20.614
Basically.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.457
Will, I should
be in there

14:22.490 --> 14:24.151
interviewing the
second investigator.

14:24.190 --> 14:25.452
The first investigator

14:25.490 --> 14:26.889
_ should be in there
interVIeWIng the second.

14:26.930 --> 14:29.251
This is a partner-level
decision.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.494
Yeah. Which partners?

14:30.530 --> 14:31.929
Diane,
Rick,

14:31.970 --> 14:33.289
Bob fr_om
Litigation,

14:33.340 --> 14:34.637
Alicia.

14:34.670 --> 14:35.637
Yes.

14:35.670 --> 14:36.967
Your back is covered.

14:37.010 --> 14:39.069
This is a good thing, Kalinda.

14:39.110 --> 14:40.907
More work, more money,

14:40.940 --> 14:41.907
more prestige.

14:41.940 --> 14:42.941
(scoffs)

14:44.010 --> 14:47.275
You know, somehow,
when people say "more prestige,"

14:47.320 --> 14:49.140
they usually mean "less power."

14:52.050 --> 14:53.449
Check on Chef De Luca!

14:53.490 --> 14:55.355
Is he
leaVIng us?

14:55.390 --> 14:58.052
Look, I'm from
Lockhart/Gardner,

14:58.090 --> 15:00.456
and I'm here to make sure
that you're happy.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.489
Needs more cheese.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.921
You paid your bill in full,
on time.

15:05.970 --> 15:07.130
That usually suggests

15:07.170 --> 15:08.262
that a client is leaving.

15:08.300 --> 15:09.961
(chuckles)
I'm fine.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.466
Good.

15:11.510 --> 15:13.273
Because we're offering clients

15:13.310 --> 15:15.278
a five-percent
discount on services

15:15.310 --> 15:16.629
in exchange for a retainer.

15:18.580 --> 15:21.310
Lately your firm has
stopped making me feel...

15:21.350 --> 15:22.510
special.

15:22.550 --> 15:23.983
Okay. So...

15:24.020 --> 15:26.614
how can we make you feel
special again?

15:26.650 --> 15:28.618
In my experience

15:28.660 --> 15:29.558
the larger
the firm,

15:29.590 --> 15:31.729
the harder it is to change
their behavior.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.489
It's not
about teaching

15:33.530 --> 15:35.395
an old dog
new tricks,

15:35.430 --> 15:37.489
it's about teaching a big dog.

15:37.530 --> 15:38.519
So you're
considering

15:38.570 --> 15:40.128
using a smaller dog.

15:40.170 --> 15:41.432
(laughs)

15:41.470 --> 15:42.698
Might you
tell me

15:42.740 --> 15:43.968
which dog you're
speaking with?

15:44.010 --> 15:45.329
Sure.

15:45.370 --> 15:46.974
It's one of your lawyers.

15:47.010 --> 15:47.669
Trying to
convince me

15:47.710 --> 15:49.029
to jump ship
with him.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.104
Which of our lawyers?

15:50.150 --> 15:51.344
I... no.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.745
You'll just get him fired.
No. I won't.

15:52.780 --> 15:54.645
Well, don't you think it's fair

15:54.680 --> 15:56.216
you tell us who
we're competing with?

15:56.250 --> 15:57.217
Someone
who's

15:57.250 --> 15:59.047
good on my cases.

15:59.090 --> 16:00.284
That's all
I'll say.

16:02.290 --> 16:03.484
Cary Agos?

16:05.690 --> 16:07.226
But it is Cary Agos?

16:07.260 --> 16:09.728
That's_all
I'm saying.

16:11.330 --> 16:12.695
(bowling pins crash)

16:15.770 --> 16:18.307
I looked into your background,
Mr. Lester.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.399
That sounds dramatic.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.635
You've been a lavwer
for 25 years,

16:22.680 --> 16:24.409
but you've never tried
a single case.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.270
Well, I don't like court.

16:26.310 --> 16:28.039
You've never
written one brief.

16:28.080 --> 16:28.944
None that I could find, aanay.

16:28.980 --> 16:30.686
I don't like putting
things in writing.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.278
You don't have a firm,
and from what I can tell,

16:32.320 --> 16:33.355
you don't have an office either.

16:33.390 --> 16:34.687
Well, I like working from home.

16:34.720 --> 16:35.550
You've_ had
one client

16:35.590 --> 16:37.251
for the last ten years:
Lemond Bishop.

16:37.290 --> 16:39.224
And before that,
you had one client

16:39.260 --> 16:40.295
for 12
years.

16:40.330 --> 16:41.695
Anthony Grozzi,
until he was

16:41.730 --> 16:42.754
murdered
in 2003.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.199
Guilty.
So what
exactly...

16:44.230 --> 16:46.391
do you do?

16:46.430 --> 16:50.799
I have only one client because
I don't like to work very much.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.729
I like working at home
because I like spending time

16:53.780 --> 16:55.372
with my wife.

16:55.410 --> 16:58.208
What I do for
Mr. Bishop is...

16:58.250 --> 17:00.309
I offer dedicated service.

17:00.350 --> 17:01.669
I update him,

17:01.720 --> 17:03.381
I keep an eye out for problems,

17:03.420 --> 17:06.082
and when I think things are
going wrong, I tell him.

17:06.120 --> 17:08.782
I'm a small-town
lawyer

17:08.820 --> 17:10.321
with a small-time practice.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.248
Like Abraham Lincoln.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.558
This case is winnable,
Mr. Lester.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.329
I didn't say it wasn't.
Mr. Bishop
didn't do it.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.736
He's innocent,
and I can prove it.

17:20.770 --> 17:22.135
Good.

17:22.170 --> 17:24.058
That's all he wants.

17:24.110 --> 17:26.670
Thanks for meeting me here.
Sorry, I...

17:26.710 --> 17:27.734
I get the kids once a week.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.475
I'm gonna say to you
the same thing

17:29.510 --> 17:30.807
I said to the prosecutor,

17:30.850 --> 17:33.671
so I don't know
what you need to know.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.609
I work for Mr. Bishop
at a club that he owns,

17:36.650 --> 17:39.289
and I saw him getting
into a tan Honda

17:39.320 --> 17:40.753
the night that
the victim disappeared.

17:40.790 --> 17:42.610
Was it this car?

17:42.660 --> 17:43.558
Look, like I said,

17:43.590 --> 17:46.388
I didn't see him kill anyone,
all right?

17:46.430 --> 17:49.422
Ijust saw him get
into that car.
Her body

17:49.460 --> 17:50.597
was found in this car.

17:50.630 --> 17:53.167
Yeah, I know.
Okay, thanks.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.838
How old are your kids?

17:56.800 --> 17:58.199
Five and seven.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.309
I remember when

17:59.340 --> 18:01.137
my daughters
were that age.

18:01.180 --> 18:04.149
It's a lot of fun
until they turn 13.

18:04.180 --> 18:07.274
And then... watch out.

18:07.320 --> 18:11.108
* La-la-la-la-la-la-
la-la-la-la-la-la. *

18:11.150 --> 18:13.459
His kids were cute.

18:13.490 --> 18:15.685
That's why I asked him
how old they were.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.154
Didn't you think
they were cute?
Yes.

18:18.190 --> 18:20.294
You thought I was, what,
implying some kind of threat?

18:20.330 --> 18:21.729
I don't know.

18:21.760 --> 18:25.321
Well, he didn't change
his testimony, so...

18:25.370 --> 18:28.464
I must not be very effective.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.797
(cab door shuts)

18:29.840 --> 18:31.364
DIANE:
"Lockhart/Gardner

18:31.410 --> 18:34.470
is an all-service law firm
intent on..."

18:36.940 --> 18:39.647
"Dedicated to."
"Dedicated to...

18:39.680 --> 18:43.639
"offering our clients
the best...

18:43.690 --> 18:47.182
legal and professional
services available..."
Great, Diane, that

18:47.220 --> 18:49.188
means nothing. Who doesn't
want to give their clients

18:49.220 --> 18:50.426
the best service?
Then...

18:50.460 --> 18:51.882
what do you want it to say?

18:51.930 --> 18:53.352
"Lockhart/Gardner wants it all.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.391
We want to be
the biggest and the best."

18:57.900 --> 19:00.937
What?
(sighs)

19:00.970 --> 19:03.632
Can we just have a moment
when we're not struggling?

19:03.670 --> 19:05.467
Please? Can we just
take a breath?

19:05.510 --> 19:07.171
We did take a breath.
No,

19:07.210 --> 19:08.575
we didn't.
Well, then go ahead

19:08.610 --> 19:10.544
and take a vacation,
and I'll do this.

19:12.550 --> 19:14.177
What?

19:14.220 --> 19:16.245
I just have to make some calls.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.217
Diane, wait.

19:19.250 --> 19:22.879
You_ weren't _the one
paying the bills, Will.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.650
You weren't the one trying
to delay our creditors.

19:25.690 --> 19:29.228
I can't go back to that.

19:29.260 --> 19:31.524
Yeah.

19:31.570 --> 19:34.767
My guess is, H thought
I saw Mr. Bishop

19:34.800 --> 19:36.199
getting into
that car, but...

19:36.240 --> 19:38.265
LIZ:
But you were
undertheinﬂuence

19:38.310 --> 19:39.663
of owcodone?
Yeah.

19:39.710 --> 19:41.234
LIZ:
Your Honor, I...

19:41.280 --> 19:42.235
This is...

19:42.280 --> 19:43.838
I am very distressed by this.

19:43.880 --> 19:45.939
JUDGE: As am I.
This is where I'd ask
for a dismissal.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.276
As you can see, Your Honor,

19:49.320 --> 19:51.345
the government does not have
the testimony to support

19:51.390 --> 19:54.211
their case...
LIZ: What we have, Your
Honor, is the testimony

19:54.260 --> 19:56.410
of his health club manager,
plus we have new evidence--

19:56.460 --> 19:57.427
we have a videotape

19:57.460 --> 19:59.883
that shows Mr. Bishop
at a social gathering

19:59.930 --> 20:00.851
with the victim.
ALICIA:
Your Honor, none of this

20:00.900 --> 20:02.822
is sufficient
to warrant the indictment...

20:02.860 --> 20:04.396
LIZ: Perhaps Mrs.
Florrick has forgotten,

20:04.430 --> 20:06.864
but the purpose of a preliminary
hearing is to determine

20:06.900 --> 20:09.892
whether probable cause exists.
JUDGE: Agreed, and I
find the affidavit

20:09.940 --> 20:12.465
of the health club manager,
Mr. Dexter Roja,

20:12.510 --> 20:15.229
quite persuasive. I'll
hear his testimony.

20:16.410 --> 20:17.342
LIZ:
Bishop

20:17.380 --> 20:19.769
is using you
to intimidate these witnesses.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.243
Oh, come on.
Every single time
you question one,

20:21.280 --> 20:22.713
they recant.
Have you ever thought
that you

20:22.750 --> 20:24.388
might've intimidated
these witnesses to get them

20:24.420 --> 20:25.409
to testify?

20:26.320 --> 20:29.289
You know, we used
to feel bad for you.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.288
The old gang from school.

20:31.330 --> 20:34.299
We all called each other after
your press conference and said,

20:34.330 --> 20:36.548
"Can you believe it,
having your husband admit

20:36.600 --> 20:38.261
to sleeping with prostitutes?"

20:38.300 --> 20:40.268
Now I see.

20:40.300 --> 20:42.291
You were made for each other.
Do you know what

20:42.340 --> 20:44.558
I've thought of you
since school?

20:44.610 --> 20:45.929
What?

20:45.970 --> 20:48.006
Nothing.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.877
(quietly):
So, you want to check out
this videotape?

20:51.910 --> 20:52.979
Yes, I think we should.

20:53.010 --> 20:54.170
ALICIA:
Well, the problem

20:54.220 --> 20:56.973
is Dexter Roja.
We're interviewing him next.
You and...

20:57.020 --> 20:58.419
Lester both?
Yes.

20:58.450 --> 21:00.953
Mrs. Florrick and I
are becoming quite the team.

21:00.990 --> 21:02.582
Good.

21:02.620 --> 21:04.485
Mrs. Florrick,
if you don't mind,

21:04.530 --> 21:06.486
Charles and I have
another matter to discuss.

21:06.530 --> 21:08.350
If it has to do with the case,
I should...
No,

21:08.400 --> 21:09.651
it's another matter.

21:09.700 --> 21:11.998
It will just
take a minute.

21:12.030 --> 21:14.032
Okay.

21:20.610 --> 21:22.931
JUDY:
What happens if
this Dexter guy

21:22.980 --> 21:25.949
can't supply any information
to help the feds?
Our hope is,

21:25.980 --> 21:26.878
either they drop the charges

21:26.910 --> 21:29.310
or the judge grants a motion
to dismiss.

21:29.350 --> 21:30.544
Ma'am, there's a call for you.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.410
Are you sure?
Yes.

21:32.450 --> 21:33.519
Mrs. Florrick?

21:36.390 --> 21:38.881
(Liz speaks indistinctly, stops)

21:40.400 --> 21:43.563
LIZ:
We're driving home, and I turn
to my son in the backseat,

21:43.600 --> 21:44.965
and that's
when I noticed

21:45.000 --> 21:46.797
a black Escalade following us.

21:46.830 --> 21:48.559
And at home
I pointed it out

21:48.600 --> 21:51.068
to my husband. And as soon
as he stepped outside,

21:51.110 --> 21:52.737
it skidded away.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.874
Now, apparently, Mr. Bishop is

21:54.910 --> 21:56.639
no longer content with just
intimidating witnesses.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.875
Excuse me, Your Honor,
but that is an appalling

21:58.910 --> 22:01.378
accusation.
Then what happened?

22:01.420 --> 22:04.548
So, then my son tells me
that a man approached him

22:04.590 --> 22:07.980
at his preschool and he was
asking him about his mommy.

22:08.020 --> 22:10.625
About what time she was coming
to pick him up

22:10.660 --> 22:13.549
and when his
birthday was.
His birthday?

22:13.600 --> 22:17.092
Yes. And then he asked him what
he wanted for his birthday.

22:17.130 --> 22:20.361
And when my son started to walk
away, the man said that

22:20.400 --> 22:21.992
"Maybe your mommy was working
too hard

22:22.040 --> 22:24.702
to be there for your birthday."

22:25.710 --> 22:29.669
JUDGE:
You gave the police
a description?

22:29.710 --> 22:30.779
Yes.

22:30.810 --> 22:33.142
And the Department of Justice
is offering you security

22:33.180 --> 22:34.841
for your son
and yourself?

22:34.880 --> 22:36.370
Yes, yes, Your Honor.

22:36.420 --> 22:38.012
But that-that-that's
not the issue here!

22:38.050 --> 22:40.416
I know. Thank you.

22:40.460 --> 22:44.089
I... Mrs. Florrick,
to your knowledge,

22:44.130 --> 22:45.222
has anyone from Mr. Bishop's

22:45.260 --> 22:49.492
organization attempted
to intimidate the AUSA's family?

22:49.530 --> 22:51.521
No, Your Honor.

22:51.570 --> 22:52.559
Of course she doesn't know.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.828
Uh-uh!

22:53.870 --> 22:56.395
Mrs. Florrick, to your
knowledge, has anyone

22:56.440 --> 22:59.568
from Mr. Bishop's organization
intimidated witnesses?

23:01.040 --> 23:02.678
Not to my knowledge.

23:02.710 --> 23:04.075
This is a lie!

23:04.110 --> 23:05.907
Excuse me, Your Honor,
I am appalled

23:05.950 --> 23:08.441
by what happened
to Ms. Lawrence.

23:08.480 --> 23:09.674
Thanks.

23:09.720 --> 23:11.085
But we have
no proof that

23:11.120 --> 23:12.985
my client had anything
to do with this.

23:13.020 --> 23:14.419
_ What other cases_
is Ms. Lawrence pursumg?

23:14.460 --> 23:16.087
Oh, come on! You are a mother!

23:16.120 --> 23:17.985
I mean, what if this
happened to your kids?

23:18.030 --> 23:21.488
Okay... intimidating
witnesses is

23:21.530 --> 23:22.997
a disbarrable offense.

23:23.030 --> 23:24.759
You know that.
It's also illegal.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.927
I'm not saying it happened.
I'm not saying

23:26.970 --> 23:29.530
anything other than:
if you have any knowledge

23:29.570 --> 23:34.200
of any such intimidation,
or if you so much as wink at it,

23:34.240 --> 23:35.832
you are subject to arrest.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.939
Do you
understand that?

23:37.980 --> 23:39.049
I do understand that.

23:39.080 --> 23:41.674
Good. Then everyone can go.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.119
Thank you.

23:45.850 --> 23:48.557
When did you sell your soul?

23:58.200 --> 24:02.068
Okay, um, I was supposed to come
in earlier this morning,

24:02.100 --> 24:03.965
but your human resources people
called and they canceled;

24:04.010 --> 24:05.238
and then they called me back

24:05.270 --> 24:07.830
and they said,
"Come in right now."

24:07.880 --> 24:09.529
And I said, "I'm not dressed."

24:09.580 --> 24:11.673
'Cause I was babysitting
for my sister's kids.

24:11.710 --> 24:15.111
This, uh, that's not baby vomit,
by the way.

24:17.280 --> 24:20.511
Um, I usually,
I dress pretty nice.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.687
Um, more like a college student,
you know?

24:22.720 --> 24:25.120
And you were a Treasury
Enforcement Agent?

24:25.160 --> 24:29.756
Two years. I liked it.
People were really nice.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.098
Um, but, you know,
it's a bit stiff.

24:32.130 --> 24:34.530
The thing is,
Ms. Burdine,

24:34.570 --> 24:37.801
uh, we have
a particular tone here.

24:37.840 --> 24:43.278
I can do tone.
I have a much better tone.

24:43.310 --> 24:47.815
Uh, maybe I should come back
tomorrow better dressed.

24:47.850 --> 24:50.114
Do you usually work alone
or with someone else?

24:50.150 --> 24:52.118
Oh, we usually worked solo.
But if you want me

24:52.150 --> 24:53.219
to work with someone,

24:53.250 --> 24:54.956
I can do that.
I'm good. I'm there.

24:54.990 --> 24:57.288
A bachelor's in criminal justice
from the University of Illinois

24:57.320 --> 24:58.582
and a minor in dance?

24:58.630 --> 24:59.654
Yeah. Ballet.

24:59.690 --> 25:01.954
Oh, my parents
they threw a fit.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.922
Um, they are
reformed hippies.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.858
Eight kids in an RV.

25:05.900 --> 25:09.267
Uh, but I liked the criminal
justice thing anyway.

25:09.300 --> 25:13.236
I like to figure out why
people do bad things.

25:13.270 --> 25:15.079
(chuckles)
DIANE:_
Are you serious?

25:15.110 --> 25:17.032
Look at her rsum.
The Treasury put her on

25:17.080 --> 25:17.842
tracking terrorist
financing.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.802
Yes, when they took
her off of it...

25:19.850 --> 25:20.373
No, she quit.

25:20.410 --> 25:21.911
And that's a good thing?

25:21.950 --> 25:23.611
Look, I know
she's a different choice,

25:23.650 --> 25:24.582
Kalinda was a different choice.

25:24.620 --> 25:26.247
There were five ex-cops
out in that reception,

25:26.290 --> 25:27.655
and one Kalinda.
You remember?

25:27.690 --> 25:29.157
I see. So this is
about Kalinda.

25:29.190 --> 25:31.658
You two are arguing for her
because you know

25:31.690 --> 25:33.089
she won't challenge Kalinda?

25:33.130 --> 25:34.324
_No. I_think
investigators

25:34.360 --> 25:36.157
work best when you don't see
them coming.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.259
When they walk into your
business and they look like

25:38.300 --> 25:39.665
a babysitter and not an ex-cop.

25:39.700 --> 25:43.192
I am arguing for her because
she won't challenge Kalinda.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.764
They're more likely
to work well together.

25:44.810 --> 25:45.868
That's a good thing.

25:45.910 --> 25:48.071
Take her on
for a month.

25:48.110 --> 25:49.873
Let Kalinda train her.
If we don't like the results,

25:49.910 --> 25:52.640
we'll go with one
of the sergeants.

26:02.320 --> 26:05.255
Did you have someone threaten
Liz Lawrence?

26:05.290 --> 26:08.225
Did...? Who's that?

26:08.260 --> 26:10.296
Liz Lawrence.
Our opponent.

26:10.330 --> 26:14.664
The AUSA? Did you have someone
follow her kid to school

26:14.700 --> 26:15.792
and threaten her family?

26:15.840 --> 26:17.262
I thought you didn't like her.

26:17.300 --> 26:20.679
I don't. Did you have someone
threaten her family?

26:20.710 --> 26:21.677
No.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.302
I won't stand
for it, Mr. Lester.

26:23.340 --> 26:26.605
(chuckles)
Well, good for you!

26:26.650 --> 26:28.242
I said no.

26:28.280 --> 26:30.271
We don't need to play
a tough guy's game.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.185
There are other ways
to win this.

26:32.220 --> 26:34.017
Mrs. Florrick, I'm
not sure how many

26:34.060 --> 26:36.085
other ways there are
to say this!

26:36.120 --> 26:37.678
I haven't done anything wrong.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.027
I read up
on your work

26:40.830 --> 26:42.252
Deaths and assassinations

26:42.300 --> 26:43.961
all after you joined
the defense team.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.321
Really?

26:46.370 --> 26:50.158
And I've read up on your work
with Colin Sweeney.

26:50.200 --> 26:53.408
Another woman dead
after you joined his team.

26:53.440 --> 26:56.705
Defense attorneys
are in the business

26:56.740 --> 26:58.640
of being misunderstood,
Mrs. Florrick.

26:58.680 --> 26:59.601
You should know that.

26:59.650 --> 27:01.743
I'd like to handle Dexter's
interVIew alone.

27:01.780 --> 27:03.372
I don't think
that would be wise.

27:03.420 --> 27:04.887
Mr. Bishop...
Is my client,

27:04.920 --> 27:06.285
not yours.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.185
He's advised you
to bring me along.

27:08.220 --> 27:10.688
Are you saying
I don't have an option?

27:10.730 --> 27:15.929
I'm saying he's advised you
to bring me along, that's all.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.394
Let's be friends.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.788
Look, Bishop is my boy.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.307
I don't want to testify
against him,

27:24.340 --> 27:26.808
but I don't have a choice.

27:30.410 --> 27:33.243
So the AUSA is pressuring you
to testify?

27:33.280 --> 27:35.441
They found my DNA
on Christina's body.

27:35.480 --> 27:36.572
Under her fingernails.

27:36.620 --> 27:38.713
Strange they're not going
after you for the murder.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.786
They agreed, in exchange
for my testimony,

27:40.820 --> 27:41.980
they wouldn't prosecute me.

27:42.020 --> 27:45.751
They said that they found
your DNA under her fingernails?

27:45.790 --> 27:47.724
And I don't know
how it happened.

27:47.760 --> 27:48.852
We were sleeping
together.

27:48.900 --> 27:50.765
I didn't kill her.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.461
KALINDA:
It's true. Seth De Luca is

27:52.500 --> 27:54.092
thinking of leaving us.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.199
That's why he paid
his bill in full.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.401
Do we _know who else is in
the mix for his busmess?

27:58.440 --> 27:59.464
Uh, he didn't say.

27:59.510 --> 28:01.375
He didn't say,
but you can guess?

28:01.410 --> 28:03.435
No.
But you asked?

28:03.480 --> 28:05.471
Yeah.
And what did he say?

28:05.510 --> 28:07.842
Uh, he didn't say.

28:07.880 --> 28:11.748
Kalinda, what am I missing here?

28:14.290 --> 28:17.418
Well, he's looking
into small start-up firms.

28:17.460 --> 28:19.485
One-man firms. That's all.

28:19.530 --> 28:21.020
But what firms?

28:21.060 --> 28:23.028
John Michaels closed shop.
Who else is out there?

28:23.060 --> 28:26.291
Is it one of our lavwers?
Someone from our staff?

28:26.330 --> 28:27.490
No.

28:27.530 --> 28:29.168
Okay, let's give
him a call.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.736
Thanks.

28:30.770 --> 28:32.761
Oh, one more
thing, Kalinda.

28:32.810 --> 28:34.175
We have some good news.

28:34.210 --> 28:36.872
I know you've been stretched
a little thin lately.

28:36.910 --> 28:39.378
We thought adding
another investigator could help.

28:39.410 --> 28:41.878
Her name's
Robyn Burdine.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.319
She's from the Treasury.

28:43.350 --> 28:44.783
Very young, very green.

28:44.820 --> 28:46.481
She's never worked at
a law firm before.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.784
We'd like you to train her.

28:48.820 --> 28:50.959
Train her?
Uh, yes.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.389
In what?

28:52.430 --> 28:53.488
What you do.

28:53.530 --> 28:55.498
If you're
up for it.

28:55.530 --> 28:57.794
And if I'm not?
Well, unfortunately,

28:57.830 --> 29:00.298
the firm is growing.

29:00.330 --> 29:03.959
Uh, we need more hands
on deck, so...

29:04.010 --> 29:06.160
we're asking you as a favor.

29:07.210 --> 29:08.507
Okay.

29:09.510 --> 29:11.876
Why does
everything feel

29:11.910 --> 29:13.912
like we're pulling
teeth here?

29:13.950 --> 29:17.249
The family's growing.

29:17.280 --> 29:20.852
* As long as we got
each other *

29:20.890 --> 29:23.882
* We got the world
spinning right *

29:23.930 --> 29:24.988
* In our hands

29:25.030 --> 29:27.248
Oh, dear God.
Growing Pains.

29:27.290 --> 29:29.827
* The luckiest
dreamers who *

29:29.860 --> 29:31.521
* Never quit dreaming

29:31.570 --> 29:33.868
* As long as
we keep on... *

29:38.610 --> 29:40.339
You're Kalinda?

29:40.370 --> 29:42.804
Yep.
Hi. Robyn.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.569
Hi.

29:44.610 --> 29:47.374
I know, I can't believe they
hired me either. (laughs)

29:47.410 --> 29:50.573
You were a Treasury agent?
Yeah.

29:50.620 --> 29:53.851
People here sure must have
a lot of money for clothes.

29:53.890 --> 29:55.881
I've never seen
clothes like this.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.524
Hey.

30:03.560 --> 30:08.190
Hey. Okay, so the AUSA
is claiming Dexter's
skin cells were found.

30:10.070 --> 30:12.209
Hello.
Hi. Um,
Robyn Burdine.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.878
I'm the other
investigator.

30:13.910 --> 30:15.400
Really?

30:15.440 --> 30:17.237
The other investigator?

30:17.280 --> 30:19.441
What do you need, Cary?

30:19.480 --> 30:21.869
Uh... what was I saying?

30:21.920 --> 30:25.139
Uh, the AUSA is
claiming that Dexter's
skin cells were...

30:25.190 --> 30:26.487
Yes.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.158
Dexter's skin cells
were found

30:28.190 --> 30:29.987
underneath
the victim's nails,

30:30.020 --> 30:31.453
and the AUSA is using that

30:31.490 --> 30:33.424
as a way to intimidate Dexter
into testifying.

30:33.460 --> 30:35.621
So we're looking for a way
to knock it out.

30:35.660 --> 30:37.127
Okay.

30:44.970 --> 30:46.938
You have a sidekick now?

30:46.970 --> 30:47.902
Batman.

30:47.940 --> 30:49.032
You need to cool it.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.947
Need to cool what?
Will and Diane asked
me to ﬁnd out

30:51.980 --> 30:54.471
if our client Seth De Luca
was pursumg another firm.

30:55.620 --> 30:58.111
You talked to Seth?
I did.
And he said

30:58.150 --> 31:01.017
that you solicited him.
I didn't go out of my way
to solicit him.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.254
He was complaining
about overbilling.

31:02.290 --> 31:03.484
Yeah, but you
mentioned you

31:03.520 --> 31:05.056
were going out on your own.

31:05.090 --> 31:06.921
Might be going out on my own.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.894
Cary, if they
find out,

31:08.930 --> 31:10.329
they'll fire you.

31:10.360 --> 31:11.896
Did you tell them?

31:11.930 --> 31:12.669
No.

31:12.700 --> 31:14.167
You didn't?

31:14.200 --> 31:15.895
No, I didn't.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.191
Thank you.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.969
Don't do it again.

31:19.010 --> 31:21.376
I'm serious.

31:21.410 --> 31:22.900
(door opens)

31:29.150 --> 31:31.641
Tell me what you're looking for,
and I'll help.

31:36.390 --> 31:37.880
Look”.

31:47.530 --> 31:48.963
Huh.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.204
Oh... just... huh.

31:53.240 --> 31:56.277
Let's just keep our huhs
to ourselves, okay?

31:56.310 --> 31:57.971
Okay.

32:02.680 --> 32:04.181
Denatonium.

32:04.220 --> 32:05.448
What about it?

32:05.490 --> 32:07.583
It's in her system--
it's a bittering agent.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.019
Was she poisoned?

32:09.060 --> 32:10.015
No. Shot.

32:10.060 --> 32:12.278
There's not enough here
to be poisoned, anyway.

32:20.670 --> 32:22.638
What?

32:23.670 --> 32:25.501
Nail-biting.

32:25.540 --> 32:27.167
Nail-biting?

32:27.210 --> 32:29.508
Yeah, that makes sense--
lots of women put Denatonium

32:29.540 --> 32:31.349
on their nails
to keep from biting.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.309
Your Honor, this is coercion,
pure and simple.

32:36.350 --> 32:39.410
Give me a break.
CARY: The medical
examiner confirmed

32:39.450 --> 32:41.088
that skin cells
were never collected

32:41.120 --> 32:43.008
from_ underneath_
the Victim's fingernails,

32:43.060 --> 32:44.186
because there _were
no fingernails.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.653
There were no fingernails?
The victim was a nail-biter.

32:46.690 --> 32:48.055
LIZ:
Your Honor, this report

32:48.100 --> 32:49.556
is the height of irrelevancy.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.160
No, this report means the AUSA
threatened the witness.

32:52.200 --> 32:55.328
Your Honor...
She threatened Dexter Roja
with information she knew

32:55.370 --> 32:58.168
to be false in order _
to coerce him into testifying.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.360
Your Honor, this defense
is based on smears.

33:00.410 --> 33:02.674
Dexter Roja is one
of Mr. Bishop's lieutenants...

33:02.710 --> 33:03.506
Health club managers.

33:03.540 --> 33:05.679
His testimony is vital
to our case.

33:05.710 --> 33:08.645
Yes, but Ms.-Ms. Lawrence
has accused us

33:08.680 --> 33:10.773
of intimidating
witnesses.

33:10.820 --> 33:13.288
Shouldn't she be held
to the same standard?

33:13.320 --> 33:15.413
Yes, she should.

33:15.460 --> 33:18.327
Threatening a witness with
lies in order to get him

33:18.360 --> 33:20.487
to testify leaves me
with no other choice

33:20.530 --> 33:22.350
but to exclude said testimony.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.129
Unless you have

33:24.170 --> 33:25.797
any other witnesses,
I am going

33:25.830 --> 33:27.127
to be forced to dismiss.

33:27.170 --> 33:28.762
Your Honor, the
government disagrees

33:28.800 --> 33:31.462
with your characterization
of our actions,

33:31.510 --> 33:34.206
but we do have one more witness
that we would like to call.

33:34.240 --> 33:35.537
A witness who
Will question

33:35.580 --> 33:37.377
Mr. Bishop's alibi.
We would like

33:37.410 --> 33:39.640
to amend the witness list
to include Judy Bishop,

33:39.680 --> 33:41.671
the sister of the accused.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.309
Judy?

33:49.360 --> 33:51.123
Please don't speak
to our witness.

33:51.160 --> 33:54.197
Judy, this is wrong.

33:54.230 --> 33:56.528
Now what?

33:56.560 --> 33:57.720
I have no idea.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.831
JUDY:
My brother asked me
to babysit Dylan.

34:03.870 --> 34:05.633
He said he would only be out
for a few hours.

34:05.670 --> 34:07.365
LIZ:
And this was the
night of October 24?

34:07.410 --> 34:09.435
The night that Christina
Diaz was killed?

34:09.480 --> 34:11.402
Yes.
Mr. Bishop claims that

34:11.450 --> 34:14.374
he returned home from his horse
farm around 9:00 pm. that night

34:14.420 --> 34:15.569
Is that your recollection?

34:15.620 --> 34:16.746
No.

34:16.780 --> 34:18.645
He didn't return home

34:18.690 --> 34:21.409
until just before midnight.
And what was

34:21.460 --> 34:23.485
Mr. Bishop's temperament
when he got home?

34:23.520 --> 34:25.420
Uh, agitated.

34:25.460 --> 34:26.779
A little nervous.

34:26.830 --> 34:28.798
He took a shower right away.

34:28.830 --> 34:29.728
And then you left?

34:29.760 --> 34:32.490
He asked me how to
use the washer first.

34:32.530 --> 34:33.963
Guess he never learned how.
Never had to.
She's lying.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.299
She wants custody of Dylan.
And what did he need
to wash so urgently?

34:37.340 --> 34:39.638
The clothes he was wearing.
Trying to get rid of evidence?

34:39.670 --> 34:41.809
Objection, Your Honor.
JUDGE:
Sustained.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.330
No further questions.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.845
Judy,

34:47.880 --> 34:50.769
two years ago, when your brother
was getting a divorce,

34:50.820 --> 34:53.744
you wrote
a character reference letter.

34:53.790 --> 34:56.816
In which you called
him honorable and
a wonderful father.

34:56.860 --> 34:59.283
That was before I knew
everything he was involved in.

34:59.330 --> 35:01.252
I didn't want to believe
the rumors.

35:02.630 --> 35:03.597
believe the rumors?

35:03.630 --> 35:05.427
A young woman
was shot to death.

35:05.470 --> 35:07.688
If he had a hand in it,
then he needs to be punished.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.306
You love your nephew very much,

35:11.340 --> 35:12.659
don't you?

35:12.710 --> 35:14.439
Like he's my own son. Yes.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.777
And as his guardian,

35:15.810 --> 35:17.505
you would be petitioning
for full custody

35:17.540 --> 35:19.303
if Mr. Bishop was found guilty.

35:19.350 --> 35:20.374
Objection.
How is this relevant?

35:20.410 --> 35:21.775
Your Honor, this quid pro quo

35:21.820 --> 35:23.776
makes this witness unreliable.

35:23.820 --> 35:25.617
She will say anything
in order to gain custody.

35:25.650 --> 35:27.379
I only want
what's best for Dylan.

35:27.420 --> 35:28.751
That's all.

35:28.790 --> 35:31.179
You are hurting Dylan.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.629
Don't you see that?
LIZ:
Your Honor,

35:32.660 --> 35:34.218
Mr. Bishop no longer
has an alibi

35:34.260 --> 35:35.397
for the time
of the murder,

35:35.430 --> 35:36.795
which we know,
based on lividity,

35:36.830 --> 35:39.321
happened between
the hours of 9:00 pm.

35:39.370 --> 35:40.769
and 11:00 pm.
on the night of the 24th.

35:40.800 --> 35:41.937
She's gonna decide against us.

35:41.970 --> 35:43.892
Um, Your Honor,

35:43.940 --> 35:45.407
given the last minute addition

35:45.440 --> 35:47.408
to the witness list,
we ask for a recess

35:47.440 --> 35:49.476
to prepare a rebuttal.

35:50.510 --> 35:54.219
So, how you want
to handle this?

35:54.250 --> 35:55.478
You want me to just watch?

35:55.520 --> 35:56.475
MAN:
Yeah?

35:56.520 --> 35:57.544
What do you need?

35:57.580 --> 36:00.413
Hi, uh, just a few questions.

36:00.450 --> 36:01.382
We're from

36:01.420 --> 36:03.388
Bishop's law firm.
Yeah?

36:03.420 --> 36:04.557
Is he gonna get out?

36:04.590 --> 36:06.228
Well, we're working on it.

36:06.260 --> 36:08.694
Look, Mr. Bishop claims
that he was here

36:08.730 --> 36:10.459
around 9:00 pm. on the night

36:10.500 --> 36:12.718
of the murder, October the 24th.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.362
Is there a chance anyone

36:14.400 --> 36:15.469
might have seen him?

36:15.500 --> 36:16.831
Nah, we're all long gone
by 6:00 pm.

36:16.870 --> 36:18.861
Okay, well, I see you have
security cameras.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.332
Is there a chance

36:20.370 --> 36:21.735
they might have
caught something?

36:21.780 --> 36:24.476
No. They weren't on
the night of the 24th.

36:24.510 --> 36:26.649
Feds already tried
to confiscate them.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.477
KALINDA:
Someone manually
turned them off?

36:28.520 --> 36:30.317
(gate buzzes)
MAN:
Not sure.

36:30.350 --> 36:32.215
Sometimes a storm
Will knock 'em out.

36:32.250 --> 36:34.514
Uh, that gate, does
it open and close

36:34.560 --> 36:36.755
every time someone
comes and goes?
Yeah.

36:36.790 --> 36:38.758
And that's the only way
on and off the property?

36:38.790 --> 36:40.678
WILL:
We asked

36:40.730 --> 36:42.550
our investigators
to look into your alibi.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.659
ALICIA:
You said you were alone
at the horse farm

36:44.700 --> 36:45.894
at the time of the murder?

36:45.930 --> 36:47.591
Yes.
CARY:
The electronic log

36:47.630 --> 36:49.939
at the farm,
it shows that someone

36:49.970 --> 36:52.700
was buzzed in
from lnSIde the corral

36:52.740 --> 36:55.277
at 8:32 pm.

36:55.310 --> 36:56.436
Okay.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.435
You let someone in?

36:58.480 --> 37:00.505
If you did,
you need to tell us.

37:00.550 --> 37:02.518
Whoever you let in
can alibi you.

37:02.550 --> 37:04.939
Mr. Bishop,

37:04.990 --> 37:07.618
please, we need
to use this person.

37:11.990 --> 37:13.457
I had a meeting.

37:13.490 --> 37:15.651
A meeting you didn't
want caught on camera?

37:15.700 --> 37:17.588
Some associates.

37:17.630 --> 37:20.963
From another... organization.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.638
Will they corroborate
your alibi?
It doesn't matter.

37:22.670 --> 37:24.558
I can't admit on the stand
that I was meeting with them.

37:24.610 --> 37:25.634
It's the only way to refute

37:25.670 --> 37:26.762
your sister's testimony.
No.

37:26.810 --> 37:28.334
I'll lose Dylan.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.472
You'll have the best
family law

37:29.510 --> 37:30.477
attorney in Chicago.
And what?

37:30.510 --> 37:31.272
Supervised visitation
every other Saturday?

37:31.310 --> 37:34.347
We can roll the dice
and go to trial.

37:34.380 --> 37:36.644
But your sister's testimony
will be damaging.

37:38.850 --> 37:39.987
What do you think?

37:41.020 --> 37:43.557
I think you know

37:43.590 --> 37:45.057
what you have to do.

37:45.090 --> 37:47.524
*

37:52.700 --> 37:55.032
(indistinct crowd chatter)

37:55.070 --> 37:56.867
Hey.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.629
Hey.

37:58.670 --> 37:59.864
Good work on that
horse farm.

37:59.910 --> 38:01.707
I think it might
turn things around.

38:01.740 --> 38:03.571
And, uh...
(sighs)

38:03.610 --> 38:05.077
talked to Seth De Luca.

38:05.110 --> 38:07.578
He's not going to say anything
to Will and Diane, so...

38:07.610 --> 38:08.918
Good.
(chuckles)

38:08.950 --> 38:10.076
Yeah.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.008
Thanks for that.

38:12.050 --> 38:13.711
Warning me.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.480
Ah, it's all in a day's work.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.454
No.

38:20.730 --> 38:22.550
It wasn't.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.056
Wasn't in a day's work.

38:24.100 --> 38:25.988
Okay...

38:29.700 --> 38:31.361
Cary, what do you want?

38:33.840 --> 38:35.671
No.

38:35.710 --> 38:37.701
Why?

38:37.740 --> 38:39.674
Because you
want more,

38:39.710 --> 38:41.678
and I can't give you more.

38:41.720 --> 38:42.618
Because of women?

38:42.650 --> 38:43.617
No.

38:43.650 --> 38:45.538
Because we work together?

38:45.590 --> 38:46.648
Yeah.
Well,

38:46.690 --> 38:48.453
I'm thinking of leaving, so...

38:48.490 --> 38:50.481
(chuckles)

38:55.860 --> 38:58.693
Well, then, say something nice.

39:01.740 --> 39:02.889
You look great.

39:05.140 --> 39:06.129
The way that
your hair hangs...

39:06.170 --> 39:07.432
All right.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.472
(laughs)

39:19.550 --> 39:21.552
(elevator bell dings)

39:26.460 --> 39:29.054
Hey.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.397
What?

39:30.430 --> 39:31.397
(murmurs)

39:31.430 --> 39:32.727
Just said, "Hey."

39:35.100 --> 39:36.590
Any word on Bishop?

39:36.640 --> 39:37.766
Not yet.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.939
Alicia's heading
out to court.

39:39.970 --> 39:41.506
Okay.

39:42.110 --> 39:43.429
That's that.

39:45.110 --> 39:47.101
(children yelling indistinctly)

40:02.100 --> 40:03.556
Hello, Judy.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.659
You mind ifI come in?

40:08.840 --> 40:11.809
Please, no more
mission statements.

40:13.470 --> 40:14.732
What are we toasting?
(cork pops)

40:14.780 --> 40:17.135
We never celebrated.

40:17.180 --> 40:18.670
When things go right,

40:18.710 --> 40:20.803
you need to celebrate.

40:20.850 --> 40:23.171
But what are we
celebrating?

40:23.220 --> 40:25.780
(clears throat)

40:25.820 --> 40:27.617
We came back from the dead.

40:30.190 --> 40:32.454
To beating bankruptcy.

40:32.490 --> 40:35.129
Beating bankruptcy.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.465
We were wound
up for so long,

40:38.500 --> 40:39.922
we never unwound.

40:39.970 --> 40:41.733
We breezed right
through winning.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.109
What's that?

40:45.140 --> 40:47.165
It's for you.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.204
It's from the 27th floor.

40:52.250 --> 40:54.138
I saved it from the Dumpster.

40:57.950 --> 41:00.817
It was so close, wasn't it?

41:00.850 --> 41:02.249
The end.

41:02.290 --> 41:05.088
Our careers in ruin.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.552
Yes.
I don't want that

41:06.590 --> 41:08.558
to happen again.
I know. It won't.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.192
We're smarter now,
we're better at it.

41:11.230 --> 41:13.698
I don't know if that matters.

41:13.730 --> 41:15.539
It does.

41:16.570 --> 41:18.709
Okay, I'll change my vote.

41:18.740 --> 41:20.230
Good.

41:20.270 --> 41:21.931
You're supposed to say,

41:21.980 --> 41:23.572
"You don't have to."
You don't have to.

41:23.610 --> 41:25.475
But I'm glad you did.

41:29.780 --> 41:30.940
Well...

41:30.980 --> 41:33.915
Mrs. Florrick.

41:33.950 --> 41:36.214
How do you manage
to look so refreshed

41:36.260 --> 41:37.682
after an all-nighter?

41:37.720 --> 41:39.153
I knew ifI dug deep enough,

41:39.190 --> 41:41.658
I'd find precedents to get
Judy's testimony kicked.

41:41.700 --> 41:42.689
And did you?

41:42.730 --> 41:44.152
USA v. East.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.792
When a prosecutor offers aid

41:45.830 --> 41:47.263
to a witness in a civil trial

41:47.300 --> 41:48.562
as a quid pro quo
for testimony...

41:48.600 --> 41:49.737
It's okay.

41:49.770 --> 41:50.896
You sold me.

41:50.940 --> 41:54.068
Time to knock Liz's teeth out.

41:57.010 --> 41:58.102
BAILIFF:
All rise.

41:59.880 --> 42:02.269
Your Honor, I know
the AUSA has not yet arrived,

42:02.320 --> 42:04.618
but I have prepared
a brief in support

42:04.650 --> 42:06.311
of my motion to exclude
Judy Bishop's testimony.

42:06.350 --> 42:07.988
That won't be necessary,
Mrs. Florrick.

42:08.020 --> 42:09.248
Uh, but, Your Honor...

42:09.290 --> 42:11.281
Ms. Bishop has withdrawn
her testimony.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.891
And, given the
government's

42:16.930 --> 42:19.819
lack of _evidence
and Witnesses,

42:19.870 --> 42:21.838
I am releasing
you, Mr. Bishop.

42:21.870 --> 42:23.792
Yes!

42:23.840 --> 42:26.229
* Cindy, Cindy

42:26.270 --> 42:30.229
* Where have you gone?

42:30.280 --> 42:31.235
* You wore your lipstick

42:31.280 --> 42:32.907
* Just to tell me good-bye

42:32.950 --> 42:40.140
* And I'm blue, blue, blue
Without you *

42:40.190 --> 42:42.158
* La-la-la-la-la-la-
la-la-la-la-la-la. *
