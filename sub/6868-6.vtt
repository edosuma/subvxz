WEBVTT

00:03.196 --> 00:03.963
Lemme go!

00:03.965 --> 00:05.937
You have no jurisdiction over me!

00:05.939 --> 00:07.071
I'm a Canadian citizen!

00:07.073 --> 00:10.653
Yeah, and we're taking you to Canada, so--
Help!

00:10.655 --> 00:11.020
Help!

00:11.022 --> 00:11.890
Extraordinary rendition!

00:11.892 --> 00:12.525
Extraordinary rendition!

00:13.261 --> 00:15.661
Light him up, newbie.

00:15.663 --> 00:17.428
Sorry in advance.

00:17.430 --> 00:18.194
Owww!

00:18.196 --> 00:19.628
That hurts like, insanely bad.

00:19.630 --> 00:22.566
That's why I said sorry in advance.
And you have to have to

00:22.568 --> 00:24.970
stop yelling "extraordinary rendition."

00:24.972 --> 00:25.972
A, nobody cares.

00:25.974 --> 00:27.643
And --
Be careful!

00:27.645 --> 00:29.344
You big lummox!

00:29.346 --> 00:32.682
- I swear to God, if you scuff my bags...
- Oh,

00:32.683 --> 00:33.382
I wouldn't dream of it, ma'am.

00:33.384 --> 00:35.616
And I can do
without the sarcasm.

00:35.618 --> 00:38.020
Oh, no ma'am, that wasn't --
Enough!

00:38.022 --> 00:39.055
With the backchat!

00:39.057 --> 00:41.290
Ugh, Lana, maybe you can talk to him.

00:41.292 --> 00:41.724
Um?!

00:41.726 --> 00:44.429
So this is the
infamous Kenny Bilcoe?

00:44.431 --> 00:47.265
- You don't look like much of a terrorist...
- That's because I'm a

00:47.267 --> 00:47.832
freedom fighter!

00:47.834 --> 00:49.969
For a free and sovereign Nova Scotia!

00:49.971 --> 00:51.939
Is that why you
blew up a donut shop?

00:51.941 --> 00:52.807
Allegedly!

00:52.809 --> 00:55.676
If you believe Canada's illegitimate,
so-called "government!"

00:55.678 --> 00:58.680
- I'm pretty sure we do...
- Which is why we're taking

00:58.682 --> 00:59.915
you back to Ottawa.

00:59.917 --> 01:04.019
And once we do, hopefully the Mounties
will start sending us all kinds of

01:04.022 --> 01:05.188
lucrative work.

01:05.190 --> 01:05.789
How noble.

01:05.791 --> 01:08.092
Speaking of work, can I
put what I just assume is

01:08.094 --> 01:10.195
your rock collection
on the stupid train?

01:10.197 --> 01:12.065
Yes, the -- nooope!

01:12.067 --> 01:13.501
Nice try, Pam.

01:13.503 --> 01:13.935
What?

01:13.937 --> 01:16.103
You want to get on that
train so you can stowaway!

01:16.105 --> 01:17.604
Just like on the blimp!

01:17.606 --> 01:18.205
The what?

01:18.207 --> 01:20.073
Okay, no biggie.

01:20.075 --> 01:20.806
Have a nice trip.

01:20.808 --> 01:22.675
I -- wait a minute.

01:22.677 --> 01:23.675
What now?

01:23.677 --> 01:24.576
Too easy.

01:24.578 --> 01:25.877
Pam's up to something.

01:25.879 --> 01:27.811
Booooarrrd!

01:27.813 --> 01:30.847
- Well, I doubt she'll make it on now...
- Ditto for Archer.

01:30.849 --> 01:31.314
Wh-?

01:31.316 --> 01:32.448
He's not here?

01:32.450 --> 01:35.350
Mmmmmm... nope.

01:35.352 --> 01:37.018
Need to get
these bags on, ma'am.

01:37.020 --> 01:38.019
I heard him!

01:38.021 --> 01:38.552
George!

01:38.554 --> 01:42.089
- Malory, don't call him that...
- My name actually is George.

01:42.091 --> 01:42.624
Really?

01:42.626 --> 01:45.727
Dammit, I told
Sterling six o'clock!

01:45.729 --> 01:47.862
I thought you meant six a.m.!

01:47.864 --> 01:50.699
No, six --
Sterling are you drunk?

01:50.701 --> 01:51.800
Winnerrrr!

01:51.802 --> 01:52.367
Nice.

01:52.369 --> 01:54.737
- Archer...
- You knew we were transporting a dangerous

01:54.739 --> 01:55.571
terrorist to Canada!

01:55.573 --> 01:58.874
So how and why are you
drunk at six o'clock?

01:58.876 --> 02:04.045
Well the how's pretty self-explanatory,
and the why is because, hic,

02:04.047 --> 02:06.716
I thought we were leaving at six a.m.

02:06.718 --> 02:07.350
tomorrow.

02:07.352 --> 02:10.520
Ergo, Latin, plenty of
time to sleep it off.

02:11.156 --> 02:12.856
Well drink some coffee,
because there's a good chance

02:12.858 --> 02:15.425
Bilcoe's terrorist pals --
Alleged terrorist pals!

02:15.427 --> 02:17.360
-- are going to attack
the train at some point,

02:17.362 --> 02:18.795
and try to bust him loose.

02:18.797 --> 02:19.796
Awesome!

02:19.798 --> 02:20.396
Right?

02:20.398 --> 02:22.765
I'm sorry, how
is that "awesome?"

02:22.767 --> 02:24.801
Because, hic, pretty
much my whole life I've

02:24.803 --> 02:27.571
wanted to fight some guys on
the roof of a speeding train.

02:27.573 --> 02:30.974
Well if I know my boys, you
may just get your wish, big guy.

02:30.976 --> 02:33.676
Thanks, Freddy Foreshadowing.

02:33.678 --> 02:35.178
Who is this?

02:36.047 --> 02:39.482
Please tell me he's a
renowned chicken-and-waffle chef.

02:39.484 --> 02:43.352
Because I am starving.

03:19.938 --> 03:23.440
- So listen, you look like a pretty smart guy...
- Well thanks,

03:23.442 --> 03:26.043
- I like to think so...
- So why dontcha do yourself a pretty-smart-guy

03:26.045 --> 03:27.911
favor and just let me go?

03:27.913 --> 03:30.080
- Uh, because Ms.
- Archer would kill me?

03:30.082 --> 03:32.783
Well what do ya think's gonna
happen when my boys storm this train?

03:32.785 --> 03:34.051
Oh, I'm not too
worried about that.

03:34.053 --> 03:35.118
Ya should be.

03:35.120 --> 03:35.852
My boys are bad ass.

03:35.854 --> 03:37.955
Well, so am -- Lana.

03:37.957 --> 03:39.123
And I'm learning.

03:39.125 --> 03:40.858
Oh, and don't forget about Archer.

03:40.860 --> 03:41.559
The drunk guy?

03:41.561 --> 03:44.795
He may have seemed drunk, but he's--
Still drinking?

03:44.797 --> 03:46.864
Relax, Lana it's
just a bloody mary.

03:46.866 --> 03:49.233
And by the way, not a great one.

03:49.235 --> 03:50.935
Mr. Vodka and Ketchup.

03:50.937 --> 03:53.671
Archer, at any time in the next
twelve hours this train could be

03:53.673 --> 03:56.140
attacked by radical Nova
Scotian separatists.

03:56.142 --> 03:57.675
Armed with what?

03:57.677 --> 04:00.845
Pamphlets about Canada's
responsible gun control laws?

04:00.847 --> 04:02.613
The New
Scotland Front has guns,

04:02.615 --> 04:05.283
and they're not afraid to use them, so --
So okay!

04:05.285 --> 04:06.952
God, I'll switch to coffee.

04:06.954 --> 04:09.522
Hey Heinz 56,
can I get an Irish coffee.

04:09.524 --> 04:09.889
No!

04:09.891 --> 04:11.357
Lana, I have to taper off.

04:11.359 --> 04:16.362
Trust me, if these Noma Scojens are a
real threat, you do not want me hungover.

04:16.363 --> 04:18.863
Do you even still get hangovers?

04:18.866 --> 04:21.134
Normally no, but I
drank about two gallons of

04:21.136 --> 04:22.568
<i>mamajuana</i> this afternoon.

04:22.570 --> 04:27.439
I was playing dominoes with a, Dominican
bike gang, or was it Mahjong.

04:27.441 --> 04:28.039
I don't remember.

04:28.041 --> 04:29.374
Ridiculous!

04:29.376 --> 04:31.977
This thing's a sardine can.

04:31.979 --> 04:34.079
How are people supposed
to travel like this?

04:34.081 --> 04:35.881
Most people bring less luggage.

04:35.883 --> 04:37.416
Most people fly.

04:37.418 --> 04:40.920
So your days of sullen
superiority are numbered.

04:40.922 --> 04:42.922
I have no response to that.

04:42.924 --> 04:43.756
They never do.

04:43.758 --> 04:45.958
Now let's go find a bigger compartment.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.493
I'm afraid there aren't any.

04:47.495 --> 04:50.497
Nonsense, I'm sure
there's one here somewhere.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.998
Why are these all locked?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.432
They're occupied.

04:53.434 --> 04:58.269
So if you don't mind --
What I mind is your familiar tone, young man.

04:58.271 --> 04:59.137
What's through here?

04:59.139 --> 05:00.905
Those are private cars, ma'am.

05:00.907 --> 05:02.173
What do you mean, "private?"

05:02.175 --> 05:05.542
I mean they're not --
Not for you to be knocking on!

05:05.544 --> 05:09.746
Now I have to insist that you --
Get yer panties untwisted!

05:09.748 --> 05:11.314
- Damn...
Wh-?

05:11.316 --> 05:12.548
I knew it!

05:12.550 --> 05:16.985
I want this train stopped immediately
and this stowaway forcibly disembarked!

05:16.987 --> 05:19.220
Afraid I can't do that, ma'am.

05:19.222 --> 05:21.822
You can and you will,
or I'll have your job!

05:21.824 --> 05:23.289
No, she won't, George!

05:23.291 --> 05:24.123
Carol?

05:24.125 --> 05:25.458
What are you doing here?

05:25.460 --> 05:27.793
Uh, trying
to perform my ablutions?

05:27.795 --> 05:29.962
But --
This is Miss Tunt's private car.

05:29.964 --> 05:32.764
How do you have
a private train car?

05:32.766 --> 05:34.766
Uh, cause she owns the railroad?

05:34.768 --> 05:35.400
Well, half.

05:35.402 --> 05:38.369
And I knew you wouldn't let us go on
this stupid trip to Canada, so I had my

05:38.371 --> 05:39.437
cars hooked up.

05:39.439 --> 05:40.471
Cars?

05:40.473 --> 05:42.306
Plural?

05:42.308 --> 05:45.609
This car, two sleeping
cars, a private dining car,

05:45.611 --> 05:48.978
and one that's just a
teeny tiny skating rink.

05:48.980 --> 05:51.613
Er, two sleeping cars?

05:51.615 --> 05:54.616
Do you think there might be room for --
Nooope.

05:54.618 --> 06:01.588
It's already cramped back there,
what with that piss-reeking ocelot.

06:01.590 --> 06:03.757
Plus George
says you stiffed him.

06:03.759 --> 06:04.224
Wh-?

06:04.226 --> 06:06.192
No I didn't, I gave him a tip!

06:06.194 --> 06:07.127
A stick of gum?

06:07.129 --> 06:08.061
Well?

06:08.063 --> 06:08.528
Really?

06:08.530 --> 06:09.729
Did you not have a button?

06:09.731 --> 06:11.330
You button it, missy!

06:11.332 --> 06:15.034
Oh we don't know the
meaning of private, lets all pile in.

06:15.036 --> 06:15.901
Lana check it out!

06:15.903 --> 06:16.434
Actual gas lamps!

06:16.436 --> 06:19.337
Amazing, Archer, yes, so
you think we can go guard the

06:19.339 --> 06:21.705
prisoner now, or -- RROWR!

06:21.707 --> 06:24.007
Is that Babou?

06:24.009 --> 06:24.975
Or not.

06:24.977 --> 06:25.809
Apparently.

06:25.811 --> 06:27.077
Okay --
Wowww!

06:27.079 --> 06:27.777
Lana!

06:27.779 --> 06:28.244
Cyril!

06:28.246 --> 06:28.845
Jesus!

06:28.847 --> 06:29.545
Lana!

06:29.547 --> 06:30.546
And Pam.

06:30.548 --> 06:31.414
Lanaaaaa!

06:31.416 --> 06:31.881
What?

06:31.883 --> 06:32.915
He remembers me!

06:32.917 --> 06:35.617
Cyril, why are you in here?

06:35.619 --> 06:37.418
I didn't know
where you guys were.

06:37.420 --> 06:40.087
It doesn't matter where
we are, Newb Gingrich --

06:40.089 --> 06:41.121
Then get out!

06:41.123 --> 06:42.522
where's the prisoner?

06:42.524 --> 06:44.791
In my compartment.

06:44.793 --> 06:49.261
- At least, he was...
- Although he doesn't seem to be in here now.

06:49.263 --> 06:50.596
No kidding.

06:50.598 --> 06:52.831
Mmmmmm... nope.

06:52.833 --> 06:53.765
ARCHER Lana!

06:53.767 --> 06:54.132
Cyril!

06:54.134 --> 06:56.234
- Oh my God...
- Too late, he's gone.

06:56.236 --> 06:57.235
Thanks to Cyril.

06:57.237 --> 07:00.138
Well he's not gonna jump off a
train going eighty miles an hour, so --

07:00.140 --> 07:00.772
So, yeah.

07:00.774 --> 07:02.573
We'll sweep car by car,
moving from front to back.

07:02.575 --> 07:06.043
Good, you guys do that, I'll
get a big raw steak from the kitchen.

07:06.045 --> 07:08.646
Are you
talking about the ocelot?

07:08.648 --> 07:09.246
Are you not?

07:09.248 --> 07:10.681
I'm talking about the prisoner!

07:10.683 --> 07:12.215
- Oh.
- Well, maybe they're together.

07:12.217 --> 07:14.384
Although I doubt it,
Babou's kind of a loner.

07:14.386 --> 07:16.118
Like Paul Newman in Hud.

07:16.120 --> 07:25.260
If Paul Newman had constantly sprayed
piss all over, um... oh what was her...

07:25.262 --> 07:26.859
Patricia Neal!

07:26.979 --> 07:28.539
Who I hate.

07:33.698 --> 07:34.954
Sorry for the intrusion, folks.

07:35.074 --> 07:40.304
Nothing to worry about, just some
standard, um...train security.

07:40.306 --> 07:42.314
Okay, that's all
the regular cars.

07:42.434 --> 07:46.002
Now we get to search all the sleeper
cars, thanks to your incompetence.

07:46.004 --> 07:47.737
Well you left me unsupervised.

07:47.739 --> 07:49.139
So this is my fault?

07:49.141 --> 07:50.540
Mmm, fifty-fifty?

07:50.542 --> 07:53.910
Fifty-fifty you accidentally
shoot somebody, Newb.

07:53.912 --> 07:56.379
Now come on, it'll take us all
night to search this damn train.

07:56.381 --> 07:59.649
- Well, but with Archer helping...
- I wouldn't exactly call it helping.

07:59.651 --> 08:03.087
Here kitty kitty kitty.

08:03.089 --> 08:05.422
Kitty?

08:05.424 --> 08:09.726
Excuse me, is
there an ocelot in there?

08:09.728 --> 08:11.629
No no no, what're you doing?

08:11.631 --> 08:13.864
Besides making a ms all over my train?

08:13.866 --> 08:16.533
Looking for a terrorist and an ocelot--
What?

08:16.535 --> 08:18.201
-- not necessarily
in that order.

08:18.203 --> 08:20.803
Okay that's it, we're stopping.

08:20.805 --> 08:23.072
- Frank, this is George, we gotta...
- Give me that!

08:23.074 --> 08:25.875
He's gotta keep the train at top
speed so they can't get off.

08:25.877 --> 08:27.210
So tell him to keep it floored.

08:27.212 --> 08:28.612
I will do no such thing.

08:28.614 --> 08:30.214
Okay then here, hold this?

08:30.216 --> 08:32.149
Why are you
giving me a -- oh my!

08:32.150 --> 08:34.184
Sorry, but I'm not
letting a terrorist escape.

08:34.187 --> 08:37.990
And obviously an ocelot wouldn't
survive in the frozen wasteland

08:37.991 --> 08:39.592
of upstate New York.

08:39.594 --> 08:41.227
So.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.998
Sorry Frank, uh, Miss
Tunt says she wants to beat

08:44.000 --> 08:45.399
the record run to Ottawa.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.101
Those crazy Tunts.

08:47.103 --> 08:50.471
Okay, hang on...

08:50.473 --> 08:51.373
Jesus!

08:51.375 --> 08:57.979
- Boys, hang on a sec...
- Okay boys, make sure you bring the heavy

08:57.981 --> 09:00.381
stuff, cause these crazy ISIS
bastards aren't playing...

09:00.383 --> 09:02.484
They just killed a black guy.

09:02.486 --> 09:03.618
I know, right?

09:03.620 --> 09:05.386
Welcome to America.

09:05.388 --> 09:07.555
How is that racist?

09:07.557 --> 09:11.224
Never mind, look --
I treat all servants exactly the same,

09:11.226 --> 09:12.692
regardless of their race.

09:12.694 --> 09:14.394
Hang on, I hear freedom ringing.

09:14.396 --> 09:16.429
At worst I'm elitist.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.530
But not racist.

09:17.532 --> 09:18.164
Whatever.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.967
Cyril and I searched the front half of
the train, but we didn't see any sign of

09:20.969 --> 09:23.002
Bilcoe, okay so --
I bet it's hard to see

09:23.004 --> 09:25.504
- anything from that high horse...
- So.

09:25.506 --> 09:29.241
- Unless Archer found Bilcoe in the back
half of the train... - Which, no,

09:29.243 --> 09:29.608
he didn't.

09:29.610 --> 09:30.409
Jeezy Petes!

09:30.411 --> 09:30.909
Archer!

09:30.911 --> 09:31.777
Is that blood?

09:31.779 --> 09:32.411
What?

09:32.413 --> 09:32.878
Oh.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.046
Yeah, but it's from a cow.

09:34.048 --> 09:37.449
You shot a cow?

09:37.451 --> 09:40.153
And Bilcoe's not in the back
half, so you guys must've missed him.

09:40.155 --> 09:41.788
Which, no, we didn't.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.257
Which, yes, obviously you did --
Or you did.

09:44.259 --> 09:45.024
Or you did.

09:45.026 --> 09:47.394
Because there's no way he got
off, we're moving too fast.

09:47.396 --> 09:49.029
Oh my God we totally are!

09:49.031 --> 09:52.332
We might beat the record run!

09:52.334 --> 09:55.369
You guys probably don't understand
because don't own a railroad?

09:55.371 --> 09:57.505
But it's actually a pretty huge deal.

09:57.507 --> 09:58.073
To whom?

09:58.075 --> 09:59.474
Railroad owners?

09:59.476 --> 10:01.910
We're a
pretty competitive bunch.

10:01.912 --> 10:02.845
No, Pam!

10:02.847 --> 10:04.713
No means no, now stop it!

10:04.715 --> 10:05.748
Whatsa matter?

10:05.750 --> 10:06.515
Ya chicken?

10:06.517 --> 10:08.350
I'm in a wheelchair!

10:08.352 --> 10:08.683
Ow!

10:08.685 --> 10:10.786
Bawk bawk bawk bawk bawk bawk!

10:10.788 --> 10:11.486
Ow!

10:11.488 --> 10:14.656
Goddammit Pam I don't wanna race!

10:14.658 --> 10:15.991
Couple skate?

10:15.993 --> 10:18.261
I can't believe you
have a skating rink train car.

10:18.263 --> 10:21.764
Yeah, apparently my
great-grampa was nuts for skating.

10:21.766 --> 10:22.766
That and the Klan.

10:22.768 --> 10:25.001
I -- okay, so
let's try this again.

10:25.003 --> 10:27.471
Car by car, this time back to front.

10:27.473 --> 10:31.308
Good, because Miss Stingy here
won't let me eat in her private dining car--

10:31.310 --> 10:33.176
Oh my God
we've been over thaaaat...

10:33.178 --> 10:36.112
-- so when you pass the dining
car, have a porter bring me a Cobb

10:36.114 --> 10:36.980
salad.

10:36.982 --> 10:39.983
Before or after we locate
the dangerous terrorist?

10:39.985 --> 10:41.818
Before.

10:41.820 --> 10:45.423
Sorry folks,
uh, go back to sleep.

10:45.425 --> 10:47.959
Yeah,
just disregard the gun-toting

10:47.961 --> 10:50.428
spies and the blood smeared everywhere.

10:50.430 --> 10:51.729
Oh yeah, keep an
eye out for pawprints.

10:51.731 --> 10:53.130
Where, in the blood?

10:53.132 --> 10:56.067
Yeah, I assume at some point
he'll come out to like... lick it.

10:56.069 --> 10:58.168
Come on,
we've only searched two cars,

10:58.170 --> 10:59.770
so we've got a shitload to go.

10:59.772 --> 11:03.707
Uh, speaking of, I need to
make use of the facilities here...

11:03.709 --> 11:05.376
Fine, but catch up, okay.

11:05.378 --> 11:07.045
And pay attention.

11:07.047 --> 11:09.080
Yeah, they look just
like prints from a housecat,

11:09.082 --> 11:11.249
only bigger and awesomer.

11:11.251 --> 11:14.686
Go.

11:14.688 --> 11:15.921
Hey, welcome to the bathroom.

11:15.923 --> 11:16.588
Well, thank you.

11:16.590 --> 11:17.990
No, no, wait, what're you -

11:17.992 --> 11:19.025
Ungh!

11:19.027 --> 11:21.260
I can tell you never
played much hockey, huh?

11:21.262 --> 11:24.497
Probably too busy runnin
around shootin black guys.

11:24.499 --> 11:26.566
What's the word, boys?

11:26.568 --> 11:27.400
Fantastic!

11:27.402 --> 11:28.701
They'll never see that coming!

11:28.703 --> 11:30.402
I'll see ya at the border!

11:30.404 --> 11:32.004
Archer, we don't
have time for this.

11:32.006 --> 11:33.672
It'll take like, two seconds!

11:33.674 --> 11:34.873
God!

11:34.875 --> 11:39.410
- Okay so, a Cobb salad...
- I am not taking that woman a salad,

11:39.412 --> 11:40.611
Cobb or otherwise.

11:40.613 --> 11:44.915
George, trust me, you don't want
to see my mother with low blood sug --

11:44.917 --> 11:46.217
Wait, why are we slowing down?

11:46.219 --> 11:47.852
We're at the border.

11:47.854 --> 11:48.319
Of?

11:48.321 --> 11:50.955
Uh, this new
place, called Canada?

11:50.957 --> 11:51.422
So?

11:51.424 --> 11:54.192
So, customs, passport
control, immigration?

11:54.194 --> 11:56.128
You know, the border?

11:56.130 --> 11:57.763
Yeah, but... with America.

11:57.765 --> 11:59.498
They still guard the border!

11:59.500 --> 12:01.266
Lana, we're going into Canada!

12:01.268 --> 12:03.835
Okay, can you please explain to him--
Don't do that.

12:03.837 --> 12:08.273
Okay, already knowing your answer,
I'm going to ask, "Don't do what."

12:08.275 --> 12:10.641
Make this a weird racial thing.

12:10.643 --> 12:13.945
- I knew, and yet I asked...
- What, I just don't wanna be ganged up

12:13.947 --> 12:14.245
on!

12:14.247 --> 12:15.046
George, back me up here.

12:15.048 --> 12:18.249
I'm gonna back way up,
and not be in here when the

12:18.251 --> 12:20.952
mounties catch you crazy
people with all those guns.

12:20.954 --> 12:21.586
Oh, shit.

12:21.588 --> 12:24.855
What, they're Canadian, they
don't even know what a gun -- oh, shit!

12:24.857 --> 12:27.591
He said, realizing that --
That what's the perfect

12:27.593 --> 12:30.194
disguise for some terrorists who
want to board a train to bust

12:30.196 --> 12:31.762
loose another terrorist?

12:31.764 --> 12:33.129
Oh, shit!

12:33.131 --> 12:35.432
The --
Royal Canadian Mounted Police, folks.

12:35.434 --> 12:38.468
Please have your passports and
declarations forms out and ready.

12:38.470 --> 12:39.235
Ready?

12:39.237 --> 12:42.172
Yeah, but what if they're
like, actual real mounties?

12:42.174 --> 12:45.008
Well, not to belabor the
point, but they'd still be Canadian.

12:45.010 --> 12:47.577
i.e., I doubt we're in any real danger.

12:47.579 --> 12:49.445
Okay, here goes...

12:49.447 --> 12:50.146
Freeze!

12:50.148 --> 12:50.646
Hands up!

12:50.648 --> 12:51.347
Get 'em up!

12:52.416 --> 12:55.051
I swear to God if any of
you Canadian fruitcakes move I

12:55.053 --> 12:57.119
will shoot that stupid
hat right off your head.

12:57.121 --> 12:58.287
That, that's not okay.

12:58.289 --> 13:00.388
Get 'em up Dudley Douchebags!

13:00.390 --> 13:02.023
Maintain the right, boys.

13:02.025 --> 13:05.059
Whoa, dude, we're serious, we'll shh --

13:05.061 --> 13:07.562
iiiiiiit!

13:07.564 --> 13:09.230
God damn it, Archer!

13:09.232 --> 13:10.598
What, Lana?

13:10.600 --> 13:11.966
You are so!

13:11.968 --> 13:12.801
Stupid!

13:12.803 --> 13:16.738
Thinking terrorists would be disguised as --
Royal Canadian Mounted Police!

13:16.740 --> 13:18.474
Stand down, boys!

13:18.476 --> 13:19.242
We're mounties!

13:19.244 --> 13:19.942
Piss off!

13:19.944 --> 13:20.643
We're mounties!

13:20.645 --> 13:23.413
Great, good, we're all
mounties, so no need for a Mexican

13:23.415 --> 13:24.447
standoff, eh?

13:24.449 --> 13:29.386
Oh yah, hooz aboota co-opt s'moor
American stoof there, eh, Cahnada?

13:29.388 --> 13:31.555
Stuff like Mexican standoff?

13:31.557 --> 13:33.623
- Oh, look at that, the race card...
Wh-?

13:33.625 --> 13:35.024
Let's all just
put down the guns, boys!

13:35.026 --> 13:37.193
C'mon, we're not Americans!

13:37.195 --> 13:37.593
RRROWR!

13:37.595 --> 13:39.261
Unvaccinated animal!

13:39.263 --> 13:39.962
Put him down, boys!

13:39.964 --> 13:40.429
No!

13:40.431 --> 13:41.196
Serpentine, Babou!

13:41.198 --> 13:41.697
RROWR!

13:41.699 --> 13:43.132
Aw jeez, he sprayed me!

13:43.134 --> 13:43.832
That reeks!

13:43.834 --> 13:44.733
Did he get away?

13:44.735 --> 13:47.035
Ya, ugh, he
ran right oat past us!

13:47.037 --> 13:47.669
Good.

13:47.671 --> 13:49.037
Then screw this.

13:49.039 --> 13:50.712
Please tell me
that's a smoke grenade.

13:50.832 --> 13:52.282
Okay.

13:52.681 --> 13:53.946
It's not, though.

14:01.071 --> 14:06.542
Hoh-lee --
-- shitsnacks!

14:06.544 --> 14:07.310
What was that?

14:07.312 --> 14:09.078
Probably my stomach growling.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.515
I am literally starving to death.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.616
I don't care, Frank!

14:12.618 --> 14:15.052
We are gonna beat that record,
so put this stupid train in...

14:15.054 --> 14:17.722
train-gear, and jam it!

14:17.724 --> 14:18.089
Rrgh!

14:18.091 --> 14:21.226
- I'm surrounded by mediocrity...
- In what way?

14:21.228 --> 14:24.395
In what possible way did that work?

14:24.397 --> 14:27.698
- Umm A, they're all incapacitated...
- And B,

14:27.700 --> 14:29.167
I got to blow up a train.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.268
Well thanks, Gomez --
Nice.

14:31.270 --> 14:32.836
But that doesn't
help us find Bilcoe!

14:32.838 --> 14:34.605
He's right there, stupid.

14:34.607 --> 14:35.039
Wh-?

14:35.041 --> 14:36.373
Jesus boys, what happened?

14:36.375 --> 14:37.308
I happened.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.442
Drop it, Bilcoe.

14:38.444 --> 14:40.410
You drop it, ya racist bastard!

14:40.879 --> 14:41.611
Gagh!

14:41.613 --> 14:42.279
Oww!

14:42.281 --> 14:45.148
Wait, how am I a racist?

14:45.150 --> 14:45.648
Really?

14:45.650 --> 14:48.451
Shut up and
come on and shut up!

14:48.453 --> 14:50.586
Wait, we don't know which
Mounties are the real ones!

14:50.588 --> 14:55.025
What do we do?

14:55.027 --> 14:56.092
Archer!

14:56.094 --> 14:56.993
I'm kidding!

14:56.995 --> 14:59.329
Jesus... Hey, good guys and bad guys!

14:59.331 --> 15:04.134
All of you just got a pretty huge pass,
so don't make me regret it later!

15:04.136 --> 15:04.501
Deal?

15:05.971 --> 15:06.469
Come on!

15:06.471 --> 15:09.039
I'm taking that
as tacit agreement!

15:09.041 --> 15:10.374
Cyril, what the
hell are you doing?

15:10.376 --> 15:11.976
Being blind!

15:11.978 --> 15:13.678
Oh my God, I'm blind!

15:13.680 --> 15:14.379
Sweater!

15:14.381 --> 15:15.814
Huh?

15:15.816 --> 15:16.147
Oh.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.716
When will you not suck at this?

15:17.718 --> 15:20.585
When you don't suck at...
shut up!

15:21.888 --> 15:23.254
Go ahead shoot me.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.989
It's better than starving to death.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.124
Everybody shut up!

15:26.126 --> 15:29.761
And then somebody get over
here to be my hostage!

15:29.763 --> 15:32.497
Oh for -- way to man up, Ray!

15:32.499 --> 15:32.997
Wh-?

15:32.999 --> 15:34.165
I'm in a wheelchair!

15:34.167 --> 15:37.467
Yeah, no offense but we're gonna
be, ya know, running around and stuff?

15:37.469 --> 15:38.268
Uh, no!

15:38.270 --> 15:39.236
You're not!

15:39.238 --> 15:40.036
Uh, yeah!

15:40.038 --> 15:40.604
I am!

15:43.575 --> 15:44.508
Everybody okay?

15:44.510 --> 15:45.609
Yeah, I think so.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.109
Yeah.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.378
Paralyzed, but other
than that, fine. Yeah.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.614
- Okay, then Lana, you guard them...
- Okay, what's the plan.

15:51.616 --> 15:55.451
And Cyril, you keep sliding down
the learning curve like the Banana Splits.

15:55.453 --> 15:56.452
And what are you gonna do?

15:57.189 --> 15:59.989
I am going to
fulfill my lifelong dream.

15:59.991 --> 16:03.158
Meeting Mr. Greenjeans?

16:03.160 --> 16:04.326
Snap out of it, boys!

16:04.328 --> 16:05.160
Bilcohhhhhh!

16:05.162 --> 16:07.662
I could use
some help on the roof!

16:07.664 --> 16:12.066
Oh my God, this
is gonna be awwshiiiit!

16:12.068 --> 16:12.900
Owww!

16:12.902 --> 16:13.534
The dust!

16:13.536 --> 16:18.504
It's like being shot in the eyes by a...
glittergun!

16:18.506 --> 16:20.106
There, that oughta do it.

16:20.108 --> 16:23.476
Okay, let's try that agawwwshiit!

16:23.478 --> 16:24.745
Retinas!

16:24.747 --> 16:26.814
Seared, like tuna steaks!

16:26.816 --> 16:29.316
All I want is to fight
on top of a train!

16:29.318 --> 16:31.585
Is that too much to ask?

16:31.587 --> 16:34.221
The good news,
is now I'm furious.

16:34.223 --> 16:36.557
So, rethinking this, huh?

16:36.559 --> 16:39.294
On top of the train you're
still like, on the train,

16:39.296 --> 16:41.796
plus you got all -- oh shit!

16:41.798 --> 16:43.531
Plus you got all that.

16:43.533 --> 16:49.603
Oh shit. Whyyyyyyyyy--
-- do people do this?

16:49.605 --> 16:51.639
You're still just on the train.

16:51.641 --> 16:52.540
I know, right?

16:52.542 --> 16:54.375
Although, I guess sometimes
there's a helicopter?

16:54.377 --> 16:56.043
Do you have a helicopter?

16:56.045 --> 16:57.945
Mmmmmm... nope.

16:57.947 --> 16:58.479
Just a gun.

16:58.481 --> 17:00.213
It's empty, dickhead.

17:00.215 --> 17:02.382
Yeah nice try, super-dickhead.

17:03.785 --> 17:04.384
What the...?

17:04.386 --> 17:06.853
You fired eight
rounds, ultradickhead.

17:06.855 --> 17:10.891
Am I the only person who ever
keeps track of that, -- oww!

17:10.893 --> 17:13.492
- Wow, and I thought I was mad before...
- Why,

17:13.494 --> 17:16.063
didja see some old black lady
sittin in the front of a bus?

17:16.065 --> 17:18.199
What is your deal
with calling me a racist?

17:18.201 --> 17:22.670
Well A, you're American --
That's, oh shit, racists

17:22.672 --> 17:24.104
jingoist, whatever!

17:24.106 --> 17:26.239
And B, you murdered the porter!

17:26.241 --> 17:26.705
Wh-?

17:26.708 --> 17:27.240
No I didn't!

17:27.242 --> 17:27.906
You shot him!

17:27.909 --> 17:29.042
There was blood everywhere!

17:29.044 --> 17:30.843
That was from
a steak, you idiot!

17:30.845 --> 17:32.779
I was trying to catch an ocelot!

17:32.781 --> 17:34.681
In Canada?

17:34.683 --> 17:35.782
And I'm the idiot?

17:35.784 --> 17:37.450
Hold it
right there, boys!

17:37.452 --> 17:39.952
Royal
Canadian Mounted Police!

17:39.954 --> 17:41.087
Dammit, who are the real ones?

17:41.089 --> 17:43.023
Guess that's for me
to know and you to find out.

17:43.025 --> 17:45.960
Well I'm gonna find
out in like five -- RRROWR!

17:45.962 --> 17:46.460
Babou!

17:47.129 --> 17:48.128
He's corpuscular!

17:48.130 --> 17:48.862
Get him, boys!

17:48.864 --> 17:49.530
Nooooo!

17:52.200 --> 17:55.334
Babou, serpentiiiiiiine!

17:55.336 --> 17:58.771
- Yeah, so...
- So yeah, put that in your little secret

17:58.773 --> 18:02.342
agent notebook, along with "don't
leave prisoners unsupervised."

18:02.344 --> 18:06.046
There's absolutely no reason to
ever get on top of a moving train.

18:06.048 --> 18:07.480
Wait, what if
there's a helicopter?

18:07.482 --> 18:09.382
Ooh, yeah, or a dragon!

18:09.384 --> 18:11.050
Ooh, yeah, or some sarcasm!

18:11.052 --> 18:12.918
Ooh, yeah, or hang on!

18:12.920 --> 18:13.686
What?

18:13.688 --> 18:15.587
Waaaaagh!

18:16.891 --> 18:20.559
Aaaaaa... ungh!

18:20.561 --> 18:21.660
Babooooo!

18:21.662 --> 18:26.098
That's right, buddy, I
goww oww oww oww oww, Babou no!

18:26.100 --> 18:26.632
Owww!

18:26.634 --> 18:30.736
RRROWWRR!

18:30.738 --> 18:33.906
Oh come on, I wouldn't say
it was a complete failure...

18:33.908 --> 18:34.606
Oh, really?

18:34.608 --> 18:37.943
And what parts of this mission
would you call a success?

18:37.945 --> 18:39.945
- Well, let's see...
- Maybe the part

18:39.947 --> 18:43.549
where my non-recordbreaking
train is totally shit-housed?

18:43.551 --> 18:46.085
- Not as shit-housed as my spleen...
- Ooh,

18:46.087 --> 18:49.422
or maybe the part where the mounties
will never hire ISIS again!

18:49.424 --> 18:52.025
What's it matter, we're
all banned from Canada.

18:52.027 --> 18:56.029
- Au revoir, sweet man-whores of Montreal...
- Ugh.

18:56.031 --> 18:56.730
Lana?

18:56.732 --> 18:57.531
You were saying?

18:57.533 --> 19:00.968
- Ah, well, we did help with a major arrest...
- Kenny Bilcoe,

19:00.970 --> 19:04.271
you're under arrest for violation of
sections one through nine of the Canadian

19:04.273 --> 19:05.506
Terrorism Act, buddy.

19:05.508 --> 19:07.641
Sorry to cut into
yer donut supply, boys.

19:07.643 --> 19:09.977
Long live free Nova Scotia!

19:09.979 --> 19:13.580
- Oh wait, make that five...
- Same goes for you bastards!

19:13.582 --> 19:16.049
Plus impersonating an RCMP constable!

19:16.051 --> 19:17.717
That's not
fair, you're doin it!

19:19.921 --> 19:20.920
Oh, wait!

19:20.922 --> 19:22.622
- I guess make that six...
- And besides

19:22.624 --> 19:25.493
attempted murder on a black
guy, you're under arrest for

19:25.495 --> 19:28.930
violating the Exotic Fish and
Wildlife Importation Act.

19:28.932 --> 19:32.334
- Yeah whatever, Dudley Douchebag...
- Plus you already

19:32.336 --> 19:32.801
used that once.

19:32.803 --> 19:35.403
It was good
enough to merit seconds!

19:35.405 --> 19:36.104
You hear that?

19:36.106 --> 19:37.539
They called you exotic!

19:37.541 --> 19:38.107
RROWR!

19:38.109 --> 19:41.343
Which is just people talk for
awesome, which is what you are,

19:41.345 --> 19:44.146
which is why I was happy
to save your life, buddy.

19:44.148 --> 19:44.980
Rrowr?

19:44.982 --> 19:47.783
No don't worry, probably
just thousands of dollars in fines,

19:47.785 --> 19:53.754
maybe a little jail time,
hopefully just probation.

19:53.756 --> 19:54.788
Totally worth it.

19:54.790 --> 19:56.490
Rrowr?

19:56.492 --> 19:57.258
No, Babou.

19:57.260 --> 19:59.030
That was all sarcasm.

20:01.330 --> 20:02.047
Rrowr?

20:02.167 --> 20:03.464
Yes, all of it!

20:03.466 --> 20:05.334
You fox-eared asshole!
