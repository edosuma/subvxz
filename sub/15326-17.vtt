YOU DON'T WANT TO GO.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.539

OUT IN THE FOREST.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.593

BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF KIDS
AND A LOT OF REST STOPS,

05:06.931 --> 05:08.975
AND DADS DO GET CARELESS.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.647
- AND I THOUGHT WE WERE BROTHERS
IN THE STRUGGLE, DAD.

THAT BAG UP A TREE

WITH FOOD THEY CAN'T REACH,

AND FRUSTRATED,

IN SINGLE-SERVING SLEEPING BAGS?

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:48.843 --> 07:51.053
- I PUT A TRACKER APP
ON YOUR PHONE.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.430
- I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO THAT.

07:52.513 --> 07:56.392
- WELL, THEN THIS IS JUST ONE
BIG OLD COINCIDENCE.

YOU KNOW I COULDN'T LET MY BABY
WANDER OFF INTO THE WILDERNESS

07:59.812 --> 08:01.063
NOT KNOWING A LICK
ABOUT CAMPING.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.565
- I CAMPED AS A KID.

WITH YOUR UNCLES,

YOU WERE SIX.

WAS ROAST MARSHMALLOWS.

- DON'T MOVE.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.013
MOM, YOU'RE UNDERMINING ME.

08:34.096 --> 08:35.556
- YOU KNOW ME.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.767
I WILL STAY OUT OF YOUR WAY.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.852
I'M GONNA BE WAY OVER HERE

08:40.937 --> 08:45.358
JUST WATCHING YOU
TRY TO PITCH A TENT.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.443
- OH, YEAH?

08:47.526 --> 08:51.197
WELL, IT'S GONNA BE
A SHORT SHOW BECAUSE...

08:51.280 --> 08:55.034
THERE'S A MANUAL,

08:55.117 --> 08:57.119
WHICH IS IN SWEDISH

08:57.203 --> 08:59.705
AND FOR A PLATFORM BED.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.587
- STILL NO SHELTER,
AND IT'S GETTING COLD.

09:06.671 --> 09:11.425
SOME OF THE TRIBE HAVE BEGUN
A SLOW DESCENT INTO MADNESS.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.678
- UGH, STUPID TENT.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.304
WHY CAN'T YOU BE A PLATFORM BED?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.806
THEN I COULD BUILD YOU.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.599
- WHEN ARE WE GOING FISHING?

09:18.683 --> 09:21.644
IT'S ALMOST THE FISHES' BEDTIME.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.689
- I TOLD YOU WE'D FISH
WHEN THE TENT'S UP.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.983
WHY DID THEY GIVE US
AN EXTRA TENT POLE?

09:27.066 --> 09:28.234
JUST TO MESS WITH ME?

09:28.317 --> 09:29.986
- MY DAD'S TENT JUST POPS UP

09:30.069 --> 09:31.445
WHENEVER YOU TAKE IT
OUT OF THE BAG.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.531
- DID YOU BRING YOUR DAD'S TENT?

09:33.614 --> 09:34.407
NO?

09:34.490 --> 09:37.034
THEN YOU'RE NOT HELPING ME.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.161
UGH,
WHY DO I KEEP GETTING BITTEN?

09:39.245 --> 09:40.329
- DID YOU USE THE BUG SPRAY?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.164
THE BUG SPRAY
BUG SPRAY,

09:42.248 --> 09:44.458
NOT THE COOKING BUG SPRAY,

09:44.542 --> 09:46.252
WHICH TAKES 20 MINUTES
TO WASH OFF,

09:46.335 --> 09:49.171
SO I'VE BEEN TOLD.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.382
- NO, I DIDN'T USE
ANY BUG SPRAY.

09:51.465 --> 09:54.135
IT CLASHES WITH MY PERFUME.

09:54.218 --> 09:58.097
OH, GIVE ME THAT.

09:58.180 --> 09:58.848
OH, EW!

09:58.931 --> 10:00.099
EW!
IN MY MOUTH!

10:00.182 --> 10:01.434
IN MY MOUTH!

10:01.517 --> 10:04.353
CHARLIE, CAN YOU TOSS A WATER?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.147
CHARLIE?

10:06.230 --> 10:07.690
- HE AND JAMES LEFT FOR THE R.V.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.901
WHEN GRANDMA MAGGIE MADE COCOA.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.529
- CHARLIE!

10:13.612 --> 10:16.824
BOYS, PLEASE GO OVER
TO THAT ROLLING RETIREMENT HOME

10:16.907 --> 10:19.201
AND TELL THOSE GUYS TO COME OUT
AND HELP FINISH SETTING UP CAMP.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.787
[all sigh]

10:24.915 --> 10:27.209
WELL, IT ISN'T PRETTY,

10:27.293 --> 10:30.963
BUT IT'LL DO.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.050
[grunts]

10:34.133 --> 10:35.259
[both shriek]

10:35.343 --> 10:37.219
- OH

10:37.303 --> 10:40.389
BAD TENT!
BAD, BAD, BAD, TENT!

10:40.473 --> 10:44.268
[shrieking and grunting]

10:45.936 --> 10:47.521
- ON <i> SURVIVOR,</i>

10:47.605 --> 10:49.398
TENTS HAVE TO BE EARNED.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.233
WE SHOULD JUST WEAVE A LEAN-TO

10:51.317 --> 10:54.737
OUT OF PALM FRONDS
AND FISH BONES.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.782
- GABBY, I APPRECIATE YOUR
DISTURBING LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM,

10:57.865 --> 11:02.203
BUT YOU MIGHT NOTICE
THIS IS REAL, NOT REALITY.

11:02.286 --> 11:03.329
- HERE.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.955
SHOOT ME USING THAT BRANCH

11:05.039 --> 11:09.752
TO PROP UP THE TENT.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.837
[grunting and panting]

11:11.921 --> 11:14.632
NIGHT FALLS IN THE WILDS
OF PENNSYLVANIA.

11:14.715 --> 11:17.259
OUR SHELTER
HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.302
BUT WE WILL NOT FALTER.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.930
WE WILL STAND STRONG--

11:21.013 --> 11:23.140
OW!
OOH, BIG SPLINTER!

11:24.850 --> 11:25.643
[moaning]

11:25.726 --> 11:26.936
- HERE, I THINK I CAN GET IT.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.396
- NO, DON'T TOUCH IT.
DON'T TOUCH IT.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.188
GET IT OUT.
DON'T TOUCH IT.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.523
- NO, NO, NO, SWEETIE, SWEETIE,

11:30.606 --> 11:31.690
IT'S REALLY IN THERE.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.526
- GRANDMA MAGGIE
NEVER GOES ANYWHERE

11:33.609 --> 11:34.610
WITHOUT HER TOUCH-UP TWEEZERS.

11:34.693 --> 11:38.364
MAYBE I SHOULD GO AND ASK HER?

11:38.447 --> 11:41.033
- [sighs]
FINE.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.326
BUT WHEN YOU COME BACK,

11:42.410 --> 11:44.036
I BETTER NOT SMELL COCOA
ON YOUR BREATH.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.624
[sighs]

11:48.707 --> 11:52.336
MAYBE THIS GOES ON THE INSIDE.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.463
ALL RIGHT.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.550
[grunting]

11:59.718 --> 12:02.805
OKAY, UGH.

12:02.888 --> 12:03.764
[screams]

12:06.725 --> 12:07.685
[laughter]

12:07.768 --> 12:11.021
- OH, MY POOR CHILD.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.357
OH, STEPHANIE.

12:13.441 --> 12:16.235
[laughter]

12:17.695 --> 12:18.904
- THAT'S IT.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.364
EVERYBODY OUT!

12:20.448 --> 12:21.991
OUT! OUT! OUT!

12:22.074 --> 12:23.909
UGH.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.620
- OKAY, OKAY.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.330
I GOT AN HOUR TO KILL.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.874
I'M MARINATING A TENDERLOIN.

12:29.957 --> 12:33.252
all: MMM, DELICIOUS.

12:33.335 --> 12:34.837
- COME ON,
DO MORE OF THAT THING

12:34.920 --> 12:36.380
WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.008
[laughing]
I LOVE THAT.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.843
- OH, DO YOU?

12:40.926 --> 12:42.595
[grunts]

12:42.678 --> 12:44.263
HOW DO YOU LOVE THIS?

12:44.346 --> 12:46.056
- OH!
ARE YOU INSANE?

12:46.140 --> 12:47.349
- [screams]
- STEPHANIE!

12:47.433 --> 12:49.435
- WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!

12:52.104 --> 12:55.149
- NOW, CAN I PLEASE
HAVE SOME ASSISTANCE HERE?

12:55.232 --> 12:58.444
IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER,
WE CAN GET THE TENT UP.

12:58.527 --> 12:59.445
- [shrieks]

12:59.528 --> 13:00.404
- UGH, RAIN?

13:00.488 --> 13:02.698
- WE'RE FINE.

13:02.781 --> 13:04.992
WHEN YOU SEE LIGHTNING,
BUT THERE'S NO THUNDER,

13:05.075 --> 13:07.286
IT MEANS THE STORM'S
FAR, FAR AWAY.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.872
[thunder booms]

13:15.461 --> 13:17.713
- ANYONE HAVE ANY LUCK?

13:17.796 --> 13:19.965
- NO, IT'S TOO DARK
TO SEE ANYTHING IN THERE.

13:20.049 --> 13:20.716
- THOSE KEYS ARE GONE.

13:20.799 --> 13:24.053
- GOOD THROW, BY THE WAY.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.095
- LOOK WHAT WE FOUND!

13:25.179 --> 13:26.388
- GREAT!
GIVE ME THOSE KEYS.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.766
- IT'S A WORM.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.976
- [screams]

13:31.060 --> 13:32.895
- CAN WE EAT THAT,
BECAUSE I'M STARVING.

13:32.978 --> 13:36.732
- UGH, COME ON, CHARLIE,
PLEASE GET INTO THIS.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.400
I KNOW IT'S OUTSIDE
OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.735
- FOOD IS NOT A COMFORT ZONE!

13:39.818 --> 13:43.447
IF YOU'LL DIE WITHOUT IT,
NOT A COMFORT ZONE.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.616
- ONCE WE HAVE SHELTER,
I'LL LOWER THE ROPE

13:45.699 --> 13:46.867
AND GET OUR FOOD
OUT OF THE BEAR BAG.

13:46.951 --> 13:51.664
- PEOPLE, SERIOUSLY.
STOP TALKING ABOUT BEARS.

13:51.747 --> 13:54.375
- OOH!
I FELT A RAINDROP.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.752
DON'T YOU START WITH ME!

13:56.835 --> 13:59.088
[thunder booms]

13:59.171 --> 14:00.923
- OKAY, THAT'S IT.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.383
LET'S DO THIS.

14:02.466 --> 14:05.803
BEIGE POLE.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.888
EVERYBODY GRAB A CORNER POLE.

14:12.226 --> 14:13.519
AND LIFT ON THREE.

14:13.602 --> 14:16.105
ONE, TWO, THREE.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.107
[grunts]

14:18.190 --> 14:19.108
YEAH.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.317
- REALLY?

14:20.401 --> 14:22.069
YOU COULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT
HOURS AGO?

14:22.152 --> 14:25.155
- WELL, I DIDN'T WANT TO GET ALL
UP IN YOUR "MOMITUDE."

14:25.239 --> 14:27.116
- WELL, EXCUSE ME
FOR TRYING TO TEACH THESE BOYS

14:27.199 --> 14:30.327
TO APPRECIATE NATURE EVEN
WHEN IT GETS A LITTLE ROUGH.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.454
[thunder booms]

14:32.538 --> 14:34.290
MOVE!
I'VE GOT HAIR!

14:38.919 --> 14:40.838
- THE NIGHT DRAGS ON.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.299
IT'S COLD.
IT'S WET.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.800
THERE'S NO FOOD.

14:44.883 --> 14:47.303
AND ONLY ONE ALLIANCE
SEEMS TO BE HOLDING.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.430
[laughter]

14:50.931 --> 14:53.809
- THERE IS FOOD, GABBY.

14:53.892 --> 14:55.603
- THERE'S FOOD,
BUT IT'S MYSTERIOUSLY UP A TREE

14:55.686 --> 14:58.939
WHERE WE CAN'T EAT IT.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.816
- NOT MYSTERIOUSLY.

15:00.899 --> 15:02.401
I PUT IT UP THERE IN CASE THE--

15:02.484 --> 15:04.987
- DON'T SAY IT.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.616
- WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE NICE
AND TOASTY

15:08.699 --> 15:11.493
IN MY SLEEPING BAG, MAGGIE.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.662
- I AM.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.457
- CHARLIE, STOP BEING STUBBORN,

15:16.540 --> 15:17.499
AND JUST COME SHARE MY BAG.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.834
- NOPE.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.419
IF I'M THAT CLOSE TO YOU,
I WON'T STAY MAD.

15:20.502 --> 15:22.671
AND I WANT TO STAY MAD.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.257
- ALL RIGHT, SUIT YOURSELF.

15:25.341 --> 15:29.011
I'M ALL COZY-WOZY.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.304
- FINE.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.306
AT LEAST THEN I'LL
JUST BE FAMISHED-WAMISHED.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.433
- [sighs]

15:34.516 --> 15:37.102
- OW!
JAMES, STOP PUSHING ME.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.937
- GRANDMA MAGGIE'S PUSHING ME.
- OW!

15:39.021 --> 15:40.147
- I AM NOT!

15:40.230 --> 15:42.358
I'M SLEEPING ON A ROCK
OR SOMETHING.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.609
- OW!
- DON'T, JAMES!

15:43.692 --> 15:44.652
- GET OFF OF ME!
- OW!

15:44.735 --> 15:47.780
[all arguing]

15:49.948 --> 15:51.367
- EVERYBODY STOP!

15:51.450 --> 15:52.534
- SORRY.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.787
- THIS IS A SEVEN-PERSON TENT.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.789
AND FOR REASONS
I STILL DO NOT APPRECIATE,

15:56.872 --> 15:59.541
THERE ARE EIGHT OF US IN HERE.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.211
NOW, EVERYBODY BE STILL

16:02.294 --> 16:04.213
OR SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO GO
OUTSIDE.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.131
- SORRY, GABBY.
YOU HAD A GOOD RUN.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.344
- NOT SO FAST.

16:10.427 --> 16:12.554
THE TRIBAL COUNCIL HAS TO VOTE.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.890
- I VOTE FOR GABBY.

16:14.973 --> 16:18.560
- WAIT.
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

16:18.644 --> 16:19.812
THE RAIN STOPPED.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.313
- [gasps]
- WE CAN EAT?

16:21.397 --> 16:22.314
- WE CAN EAT.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.900
[all cheer]

16:27.152 --> 16:28.654
[whimpers]

16:34.576 --> 16:38.122
SO THE BEARS
DIDN'T GET OUR FOOD,

16:38.205 --> 16:39.665
BUT A PACK OF RACCOONS
ARE MAKING THEIR WAY

16:39.748 --> 16:41.583
THROUGH OUR STICKY BUNS.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.751
[all gasp]

16:42.835 --> 16:44.002
- RACCOONS?

16:44.086 --> 16:45.921
WHY DIDN'T I THINK
TO BE AFRAID OF THOSE?

16:46.004 --> 16:47.715
THEY'RE NATURE'S BURGLARS.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.051
- SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW,
SACAGAWEA?

16:54.304 --> 16:55.055
[birds chirping]

16:55.139 --> 16:58.434
- UGH, MY BACK IS KILLING ME.

16:58.517 --> 17:01.395
I'VE BEEN LYING ON A ROOT
ALL NIGHT.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.856
- ACTUALLY,
I THINK THAT'S MY WRIST.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.983
OH.

17:06.066 --> 17:09.153
[groans]

17:09.236 --> 17:11.446
- THIS WHOLE TRIP
HAS BEEN A TOTAL DISASTER.

17:11.530 --> 17:15.534
I SO WANTED TO GIVE THE KIDS
A TRUE CAMPING EXPERIENCE.

17:15.617 --> 17:16.910
- AND YOU DID.

17:16.993 --> 17:19.579
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT

17:19.663 --> 17:23.000
A REAL CAMPING EXPERIENCE
WOULD BE.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.127
- THAT'S THE OTHER PART OF IT.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.463
WHERE DID YOUR SENSE
OF ADVENTURE GO?

17:27.546 --> 17:30.966
WHEN WE WERE DATING, YOU WERE
SPUNKIER AND MORE SPONTANEOUS.

17:31.049 --> 17:32.634
- I WAS WOOING YOU.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.721
THE WOO IS COMPLETE.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.181
IT'S JUST WHO I AM.

17:37.264 --> 17:39.975
I'M NOT A SEAT-OF-THE-PANTS
KIND OF PERSON.

17:40.058 --> 17:42.186
- BUT I KIND OF AM.

17:42.269 --> 17:45.731
- OKAY, SO WE'RE
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

17:45.814 --> 17:46.815
IT'S OKAY.

17:46.899 --> 17:47.816
IT'S WORKING.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.820
I'M HERE, AREN'T I?

17:51.904 --> 17:55.491
[laughter]

17:55.574 --> 17:56.700
[zipper squeaks]

17:59.077 --> 18:01.997
- HONEY,
THE KIDS GOT A FIRE GOING.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.458
LOOKS LIKE GABBY'S
COOKING SOMETHING.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.585
- IS IT JAMES?

18:06.668 --> 18:09.129
- NO, HE'S COOKING SOMETHING
TOO.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.089
[both grunt]

18:11.173 --> 18:11.882
LET'S GO
BEFORE THEY EAT EVERYTHING.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.009
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

18:14.092 --> 18:17.179
NOW THAT WE'VE MADE UP,
LET'S MAKE UP.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.889
I'VE HEARD IT'S INTENSE
IN TENTS.

18:18.972 --> 18:19.932
- OOH.
MM-HMM.

18:20.015 --> 18:24.102
[laughter]

18:24.186 --> 18:25.312
- STILL HERE.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.362
- I NEVER KNEW BAKED BEANS
COULD TASTE SO GOOD.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.530
- EVERYTHING
TASTES BETTER OUTSIDE.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.616
TRUTH.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.618
- THE RACCOONS
ARE PROBABLY TOO FULL

18:39.701 --> 18:43.205
FROM EATING ALL THE GOOD FOOD
TO BOTHER WITH THE BEANS.

18:43.288 --> 18:46.416
- I FOUND MY KEYS!

18:46.500 --> 18:48.460
NOPE, THAT'S A...

18:48.544 --> 18:50.337
[screaming] LIZARD!

18:53.173 --> 18:55.509
- YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD ME HOW
YOU GUYS GOT THE FIRE STARTED.

18:55.592 --> 18:56.802
- [gasps and clears throat]

18:56.885 --> 19:00.597
FIRST I CARVED A LITTLE NOTCH
IN A PIECE OF BARK.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.224
THEN I PUT A LITTLE PILE
OF TINDER NESTING ON IT

19:02.307 --> 19:04.101
AND STARTED WORKING IT
WITH A STICK.

19:04.184 --> 19:07.145
- THEN A RANGER CAME
AND LENT US HIS LIGHTER.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.147
- [sighs]

19:09.231 --> 19:11.024
- STEPH?

19:11.108 --> 19:12.484
- WHAT'S UP, SWEETIE?

19:16.113 --> 19:18.323
- I DON'T WANT GRANDMA MAGGIE
TO BE MAD.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.074
- YOU FOUND THE KEYS?

19:19.157 --> 19:20.534
WHEN?
- YESTERDAY.

19:20.617 --> 19:24.955
BUT I DIDN'T WANT THE R.V.
TO RUIN OUR GOOD TIME.

19:25.038 --> 19:25.539
- YOU HAD A GOOD TIME?

19:25.622 --> 19:28.792
- THE BEST.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.544
- AWW.

19:30.627 --> 19:31.670
ME TOO.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.006
"MOMITUDE."

19:36.174 --> 19:38.135
- AREN'T YOU GONNA GIVE THOSE
TO GRANDMA MAGGIE?

19:38.218 --> 19:39.511
- NOT JUST YET.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.472
LET'S NOT RUIN MY GOOD TIME
EITHER.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.605
- SO GET THIS.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.107
TURNS OUT YOU HAVE TO BE 18
TO BE ON <i> SURVIVOR.</i>

19:52.190 --> 19:53.358
NEXT TIME WE GO CAMPING,

19:53.442 --> 19:55.444
I'LL HAVE TO DO A VIDEO
ALL OVER AGAIN.

19:55.527 --> 19:59.364
- NEXT TIME WE GO CAMPING,
I'LL JOIN YOU VIA SATELLITE.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.908
- THE NEXT TIME WE GO CAMPING,

20:00.991 --> 20:01.825
I'M GONNA BOOK US
A FIVE-STAR RESORT

20:01.909 --> 20:04.745
AND JUST CALL IT CAMPING.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.956
- THERE'S THE GIRL I MARRIED.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.292
- BUT I STILL HAVE TO GET
MY FISHING BADGE.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.377
- AW, DON'T WORRY, BUDDY.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.128
THINK FAST.

20:13.211 --> 20:16.757
YOU JUST CAUGHT A FISH...

20:16.840 --> 20:17.799
STICK.

20:17.883 --> 20:18.800
IT COUNTS.

20:18.884 --> 20:22.095
- ALL RIGHT!
I EARNED ALL MY BADGES.

20:24.222 --> 20:26.642
- SOMETIMES "MOMITUDE"
IS KNOWING WHEN TO USE

20:26.725 --> 20:27.726
A LITTLE "DADITUDE."

20:27.809 --> 20:31.230
- [laughs]
