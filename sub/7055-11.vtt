00:01.037 --> 00:02.637
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:02.743 --> 00:04.877
There is an alternate universe,

00:04.945 --> 00:07.830
and in it,
another version of us.

00:07.915 --> 00:09.081
Agent Farnsworth?

00:09.132 --> 00:10.783
Broyles, Phillip, Colonel.

00:11.334 --> 00:12.784
That woman processes
more information

00:12.836 --> 00:14.619
in an hour than you and I will
in a lifetime.

00:14.671 --> 00:16.053
37 people in the intersection.

00:16.122 --> 00:18.290
22 cars, 4 trucks, 2 buses.

00:18.341 --> 00:19.725
Wind speeds of
5 to 10 miles an hour,

00:19.792 --> 00:22.428
and that is just to start.

00:22.479 --> 00:24.396
They kidnapped Olivia
to the other side.

00:24.464 --> 00:26.732
For weeks,
that awful woman

00:26.799 --> 00:29.134
pranced around my lab.

00:29.185 --> 00:31.803
She's evil.
She's a temptress.

00:31.855 --> 00:33.205
And I fell
right into her vagenda.

00:33.273 --> 00:34.440
"Vagenda"?

00:34.491 --> 00:36.024
Is that an observer?

00:36.109 --> 00:37.242
Is that what you call him?

00:37.310 --> 00:38.327
They are not limited

00:38.411 --> 00:41.029
by our human perception
of time.

00:41.114 --> 00:45.834
I think these guys show up
at important moments.

00:45.919 --> 00:47.169
We've been looking
at these people

00:47.253 --> 00:49.371
for three years.

00:49.456 --> 00:51.051
Why did he make contact now?

But it's small,

01:04.804 --> 01:07.523
And with radiation,
this type of carcinoma

01:07.607 --> 01:09.908
is 95% treatable.

01:09.976 --> 01:12.978
95% survivable, Chet.

We're going to get through this.

01:47.931 --> 01:50.482
Tissue connectivity.

01:50.550 --> 01:52.885
That's what goes last.

01:52.952 --> 01:54.386
I'm sorry?

01:54.454 --> 01:56.855
First, there's the cure--
radiation.

01:56.923 --> 01:59.441
It makes you sick, weak.

01:59.526 --> 02:01.260
But it doesn't work.

02:01.327 --> 02:04.062
Not this time,
not in your case.

02:04.130 --> 02:07.566
The cancer has multiplied.

02:07.634 --> 02:09.368
They try chemo,

02:09.435 --> 02:12.504
but the cell replication rate
is just too high.

02:12.572 --> 02:15.374
Your bones hurt.
They ache.

02:15.441 --> 02:18.176
They burn.

02:18.244 --> 02:20.979
Renal failure comes next.

02:21.047 --> 02:25.150
And soon, you lose all mobility
below the waist.

02:25.218 --> 02:28.654
Impotence, incontinence,
and finally,

02:28.721 --> 02:31.189
full respiratory failure.

02:31.257 --> 02:33.725
All from one...

02:33.776 --> 02:36.695
tiny mole.

02:36.762 --> 02:41.400
Doctor told me I have
a 95% chance.

02:41.451 --> 02:43.452
You're the other 5%.

03:19.355 --> 03:21.523
Initiate scan.

03:34.587 --> 03:36.588
Welcome, Agent.

03:54.057 --> 03:55.273
You wanted to see us, Colonel?

03:55.341 --> 03:57.175
The bridge was activated
an hour ago.

03:57.226 --> 03:58.777
An agent crossed over
to the other side

03:58.844 --> 03:59.895
without any mission imperative.

03:59.979 --> 04:00.979
Who was it?

04:01.030 --> 04:02.531
Are you suggesting
that somebody defected?

04:02.615 --> 04:05.784
I can't imagine.
It was Agent Farnsworth.

04:05.851 --> 04:07.018
<i>That's impossible.</i>

04:07.070 --> 04:08.570
Who--who gave her clearance?

04:08.655 --> 04:10.322
She did.

04:10.373 --> 04:11.873
Agent Farnsworth has
the same security clearance

04:11.958 --> 04:13.208
as any senior Fringe Agent.

04:13.292 --> 04:15.193
In fact, she's responsible
for processing

04:15.244 --> 04:16.745
transit papers and clearance.

04:16.829 --> 04:18.747
It just never occurred to us--

04:18.831 --> 04:20.236
that she would use it
for herself.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.132
Correct.

04:21.134 --> 04:22.417
What's she doing over there?

04:22.502 --> 04:23.552
We don't know.

04:23.636 --> 04:25.087
<i>She went off the grid</i>
<i>immediately</i>

04:25.154 --> 04:27.806
<i>after crossing over.</i>

04:27.873 --> 04:28.974
All right.

04:29.041 --> 04:30.842
Let's send a team of agents
to retrieve her.

04:30.893 --> 04:33.011
<i>No, she must've had</i>
<i>a reason.</i>

04:33.062 --> 04:35.147
Astrid doesn't do anything
without a reason,

04:35.214 --> 04:36.431
and after the day she's had,

04:36.516 --> 04:39.901
<i>I got a hunch</i>
<i>where she's headed.</i>

04:39.986 --> 04:42.988
I'll go get her.

04:53.366 --> 04:55.083
What would you say
to some eggs?

04:55.168 --> 04:59.037
I had a marvelous dream
last night

04:59.088 --> 05:02.224
in which eggs played
a prominent part.

05:02.291 --> 05:04.626
I would say...

05:04.711 --> 05:06.128
That we've only been working
for three hours,

05:06.212 --> 05:07.546
and we've already taken
two food breaks.

05:07.597 --> 05:10.015
At this rate,
I'll never get home.

05:10.082 --> 05:12.551
I miss the other one.

05:13.636 --> 05:15.570
I'm almost afraid to ask.

05:15.638 --> 05:18.607
Boy. The other boy.
He doesn't starve me.

05:18.691 --> 05:19.725
Which other boy?

05:19.776 --> 05:21.092
The one who plays Chess.

05:21.144 --> 05:22.110
Lincoln?

05:22.195 --> 05:24.613
That's the one.
I prefer him.

05:24.697 --> 05:28.283
♪

05:28.367 --> 05:29.951
Well, Lincoln's not here,
Walter.

05:30.036 --> 05:32.037
He's in Hartford.
It's his goddaughter's birthday.

05:32.104 --> 05:33.605
Remember? And I'd be happy
to play with you

05:33.656 --> 05:35.540
after we finish our work.

05:35.608 --> 05:38.160
Frankly, I don't think you'd be
much of a challenge.

05:38.244 --> 05:39.211
I got a challenge for ya.

05:39.278 --> 05:42.547
Why don't we fix
the machine?

scrambled eggs, Astro?

05:56.128 --> 05:59.548
It's Astrid.

05:59.615 --> 06:00.766

06:00.817 --> 06:03.769

♪

06:18.318 --> 06:21.293
<i>I don't think what he meant</i>

Hello.

06:26.769 --> 06:27.885

I always wondered why
nobody does that.

06:36.278 --> 06:39.013
What are you doing here,
Agent?

06:39.064 --> 06:42.567
I came here to meet her.

06:42.651 --> 06:44.318
Hi.

06:44.369 --> 06:46.737
Hello.

06:46.822 --> 06:48.790
Olivia told me about you.

06:48.857 --> 06:52.760
But it's nice to meet you
personally in the flesh.

06:52.828 --> 06:54.879
All personal meetings
are in the flesh.

06:54.963 --> 06:57.381
Yes, I-I suppose they are.

06:57.466 --> 07:00.835
I thought I would come here.

07:00.886 --> 07:02.837
I didn't know
where to go after.

07:02.888 --> 07:05.006
Mother might have had traditions
for such occasions,

07:05.057 --> 07:06.023
but I don't know.

07:06.091 --> 07:07.308
I don't remember her.

07:07.375 --> 07:09.393
My mother died of cancer
when I was a girl.

07:09.478 --> 07:11.345

07:11.396 --> 07:14.065
Yes.

07:14.149 --> 07:17.685
<i>At first I thought</i>
<i>I would walk in the park.</i>

07:17.736 --> 07:21.388
But it was so cold.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.608
And I could not stop thinking
about the words

07:23.692 --> 07:25.743
Reverend Stewart said.

07:25.828 --> 07:28.362
What a leader he was,
a great man,

07:28.413 --> 07:31.282
a great friend.

07:31.366 --> 07:34.018
Reverend Stewart said
he would be sorely missed.

07:34.086 --> 07:36.737
And they lowered the box
down into the ground,

07:36.788 --> 07:39.457
and we put down flowers.

07:39.541 --> 07:41.959
And I didn't know where to go.

07:42.044 --> 07:46.464
<i>Because the park</i>
<i>was so cold.</i>

07:46.548 --> 07:48.933
May I ask you a question?

07:53.805 --> 07:57.108
Yours--did you love him?

07:59.778 --> 08:03.030
<i>Astrid...</i>

08:03.098 --> 08:04.282

08:14.710 --> 08:16.878
Dunham.

08:16.945 --> 08:20.581

Okay, uh, we just caught a case.

08:33.461 --> 08:36.179

on her way here to--

08:36.265 --> 08:37.847
to sort this out.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.015
Olivia! The viper?

08:39.101 --> 08:41.018
- Walter.
<i>- What?</i>

08:41.102 --> 08:43.821
I know. Detente.

08:43.905 --> 08:45.990
That's not to say
I have to like her.

08:46.074 --> 08:48.309
Do you think that one of us
should wait here with--

08:48.360 --> 08:50.027
No, there's no need.

08:50.112 --> 08:52.079
We will be fine.
Astrid and I--

08:52.147 --> 08:54.481
really?
You get her name right.

08:54.533 --> 08:57.985
Astrid and I
can wait here alone,

08:58.053 --> 09:00.504
can't we, dear?

09:00.589 --> 09:04.041
I'm sure she'll be
great company.

09:05.877 --> 09:07.211
<i>Boston police found the body</i>

09:07.296 --> 09:09.096
<i>at 9:30 this morning.</i>

09:09.164 --> 09:11.165
<i>He was coming home</i>
<i>from his doctor's office.</i>

09:11.216 --> 09:13.935
Less than six hours ago,
Chet Williams was diagnosed

09:14.002 --> 09:15.603
with stage I melanoma.

09:15.670 --> 09:19.106
Stage one. That has
a survival rate of 95%.

09:19.174 --> 09:22.393
And that's without introducing
even one frog rectally

09:22.477 --> 09:25.029
to slow cell division.

09:25.113 --> 09:27.031
- What?
<i>- What?</i>

09:27.115 --> 09:28.783
Nothing.

09:28.850 --> 09:30.034
So what are these?

09:30.118 --> 09:32.253
Bad mascara day?

09:32.321 --> 09:33.955
I'd say bad day all around.

09:34.022 --> 09:36.791
I mean, can--can someone
actually cry blood?

09:36.858 --> 09:38.459
Rarely.

09:38.527 --> 09:39.794
Certain viruses--

09:39.861 --> 09:43.965
ebola, say--can cause bleeding
from the tear ducts,

09:44.032 --> 09:47.718
but only after most
of the organs are liquefied.

09:47.803 --> 09:49.303
Check his crotch.

09:49.371 --> 09:50.721
I'm--I'm sorry?

09:50.806 --> 09:54.225
Don't be a prude.

09:56.895 --> 09:59.146
Oh, you--you see?

09:59.214 --> 10:02.066
There's no bleeding
from the urethra.

10:02.150 --> 10:04.051
So I would say his organs
are not liquefied.

10:04.102 --> 10:05.219
Okay, good news.

10:05.270 --> 10:06.988
Walter says that his organs
haven't liquefied.

10:07.055 --> 10:08.823
So then what else
could cause this?

10:08.890 --> 10:11.892
Nothing.
Nothing real, at least.

10:11.943 --> 10:13.661
There is a-a legendary

10:13.728 --> 10:17.114
alchemical mixture--
a-a potion, as it were--

10:17.199 --> 10:19.566
called the tears of Ra.

10:19.618 --> 10:23.070
Egyptians used it
to euthanize beloved pets

10:23.121 --> 10:25.172
so that they could be buried
with their owners

10:25.240 --> 10:28.209
who pre-deceased them.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.678
But it's just a myth.

10:30.745 --> 10:32.596
Well, bring the body back
to the lab.

10:32.681 --> 10:36.250
And--and also, I'd like
some vanilla ice cream.

10:36.301 --> 10:39.887
Kirk out.

10:39.938 --> 10:42.673
You talk through her.

10:42.741 --> 10:45.393
You're Astrid.
You talk through her.

10:45.444 --> 10:47.445
As if you were one person.

10:47.529 --> 10:50.564
Yes, you could say it
that way.

10:50.615 --> 10:52.750
It must be pleasant.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.986
Yes.

10:56.071 --> 10:58.072
I suppose it is.

11:00.325 --> 11:02.243
<i>Thanks. You can follow us</i>
<i>back to the lab.</i>

11:03.578 --> 11:05.329
Yeah.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.631
All right,
keep me posted.

11:07.716 --> 11:10.217
<i>Right.</i>

11:19.461 --> 11:22.563
I think we have located it.

11:34.526 --> 11:36.527
0.26 pounds.

11:36.611 --> 11:39.146
17% lighter
than an average human kidney.

11:41.583 --> 11:42.533
Okay, Chet Williams.

11:42.617 --> 11:44.285
<i>38 years old.</i>

11:44.336 --> 11:46.704
<i>Manufactures consumer goods</i>
<i>overseas.</i>

11:46.788 --> 11:49.490
Uh, single...

11:49.541 --> 11:50.875
No debt...

11:50.959 --> 11:52.009
No drug issues.

11:52.094 --> 11:54.044
His friends say
that he's a nice guy.

11:54.129 --> 11:57.932
So nobody someone
would want to kill?

11:57.999 --> 12:00.601
Well, everybody has somebody
who wants to kill them.

12:00.668 --> 12:02.770
<i>And voila.</i>

12:02.837 --> 12:06.273
The deadly culprit
reveals itself.

12:06.341 --> 12:08.893
Odd.

12:08.977 --> 12:11.529
Always makes me nervous
when he says that.

12:11.613 --> 12:14.115
An interaction
of chemical compounds

12:14.182 --> 12:15.116
I've not seen before.

12:15.183 --> 12:17.118
Aspirin...

12:17.185 --> 12:19.286
Predictive sciences says
that these compounds

12:19.354 --> 12:22.540
shouldn't interact,
but they do.

12:22.624 --> 12:24.074
So what, you're saying
that it's magic?

12:24.159 --> 12:26.577
It's science.
Just unusual science.

12:26.661 --> 12:27.878
Huh.

12:27.963 --> 12:31.665
The way that six different
alcohols create a flavor

12:31.716 --> 12:33.934
identical to iced tea.

12:34.002 --> 12:35.753
Amen to that.

12:35.837 --> 12:38.005
It works, but no one could've
predicted it would work.

12:38.056 --> 12:39.140
<i>So you're saying</i>
<i>that he was killed</i>

12:39.207 --> 12:41.976
by a poison
that no one invented.

12:42.043 --> 12:44.061
It should go without saying,
but that's impossible.

12:44.146 --> 12:45.930
I think we're aware
of that, Peter.

12:48.716 --> 12:51.569
Oh. Isn't this a party?

12:51.636 --> 12:52.603
Hey, girls.

12:52.687 --> 12:54.688
Mata Hari.

12:54.739 --> 12:57.441
Deceived and betrayed
anyone yet today?

12:57.526 --> 12:59.660
<i>It is almost lunchtime,</i>
<i>after all.</i>

12:59.727 --> 13:02.029
<i>Deus ex machina.</i>

13:04.032 --> 13:06.333
The hand of God?

13:06.401 --> 13:08.369
The interaction of the chemicals
in the poison

13:08.420 --> 13:09.587
is not predictable.

13:09.671 --> 13:11.672
<i>The creation</i>
<i>of the toxin requires</i>

13:11.739 --> 13:12.957
<i>the assumption</i>
<i>that these compounds</i>

13:13.041 --> 13:15.042
can intermingle,
and in fact,

13:15.093 --> 13:16.544
these compounds
do not intermingle--

13:16.595 --> 13:18.745
except when they are all
mixed together, they do,

13:18.797 --> 13:22.116
which is a completely
unpredictable event.

13:22.184 --> 13:24.018
Okay, just so I'm clear--

13:24.085 --> 13:27.688
you're saying that a person
would have to--

13:27.755 --> 13:30.424
See that the chemicals
had already been combined

13:30.475 --> 13:32.276
in order to know
how to combine them?

13:32.360 --> 13:34.979
Yes, and the chances of that
occurring randomly

13:35.063 --> 13:36.864
<i>are less than 0.10%.</i>

13:36.931 --> 13:38.432
Therefore, there is a root
of the equation

13:38.483 --> 13:40.951
that is outside our realm
of causality,

13:41.036 --> 13:43.153
deus ex machina,
<i>the hand of God.</i>

13:44.439 --> 13:46.874
But Astrid, are you trying
to tell us

13:46.942 --> 13:50.177
that God taught our perp
how to mix a mythical poison?

13:52.080 --> 13:52.997
God...

13:53.081 --> 13:55.082
Or godlike powers.

13:55.133 --> 13:56.333
It--

13:56.418 --> 13:58.886
<i>it's the only thing</i>
<i>that makes sense.</i>

13:58.953 --> 14:00.621
<i>Come with me.</i>

14:00.672 --> 14:02.973
I'll need your help
to identify the origin

14:03.058 --> 14:05.459
<i>of these component compounds.</i>

14:05.510 --> 14:06.793
I think I love her.

14:06.845 --> 14:08.629
<i>Okay, well,</i>

14:08.680 --> 14:10.931
I guess that, uh, we're not
gonna go straight home.

14:10.982 --> 14:12.349
Cold Chinese in the fridge?

14:12.434 --> 14:14.101
Uh, yeah.

14:14.152 --> 14:17.238
I'll check.

14:27.866 --> 14:29.283
Here you go.

14:29.334 --> 14:31.001
<i>Did he pick up</i>
<i>that other shift for you?</i>

14:31.086 --> 14:33.671
<i>Yeah, he did, actually.</i>

14:35.156 --> 14:36.624
<i>However you want to handle it</i>
<i>is fine.</i>

14:36.675 --> 14:38.042
<i>I can go over there myself.</i>

14:38.126 --> 14:40.494
<i>No, I can come with.</i>

14:49.971 --> 14:51.805
You're putting up
a good fight.

14:51.856 --> 14:53.607
But you're not
going to win.

14:53.675 --> 14:56.110
<i>You're gonna take that drink,</i>

14:56.177 --> 14:57.611
<i>and from there</i>
<i>it's all downhill.</i>

14:57.679 --> 14:59.863
But you know
the saddest part?

14:59.948 --> 15:02.516
<i>The drinking</i>
<i>doesn't kill you.</i>

15:02.567 --> 15:05.819
Instead, it shatters the lives
of everyone around you.

15:05.870 --> 15:07.821
Everyone you love.

15:07.872 --> 15:11.659
Your boyfriend is going
to be killed in a car accident

15:11.710 --> 15:12.960
with you behind the Wheel.

15:13.027 --> 15:14.244
Your brother

15:14.329 --> 15:16.530
<i>is going to alienate</i>
<i>his wife and daughter,</i>

15:16.581 --> 15:20.017
throw away his own future
trying to rescue you.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.251
<i>But he fails.</i>

15:21.336 --> 15:22.803
No one can see the future.

15:22.870 --> 15:24.871
You're right.
There is no future.

15:24.923 --> 15:28.208
There's no past.
Everything happens right now.

15:31.389 --> 15:32.439
Now that you're back,

15:32.524 --> 15:34.608
I can finally rid myself
of this junk

15:35.492 --> 15:39.746
you left behind in your haste
to slink away.

15:39.830 --> 15:41.130
Walter, you've been holding
onto this stuff

15:41.198 --> 15:42.698
all this time?

15:42.750 --> 15:46.636
I didn't steal anything,
if that's what you're implying.

15:46.703 --> 15:50.206
Although I admit
that this one item

15:50.257 --> 15:52.475
confounded me.

15:52.542 --> 15:55.711
Just another of your tools
of spy craft, I imagine.

15:55.763 --> 15:57.730
A sinister
communication device?

15:57.815 --> 16:01.234
Some kind
of devious encoder?

16:01.318 --> 16:03.886
Wow.

16:03.937 --> 16:07.223
I really got to you,
didn't I, Walter?

16:07.274 --> 16:10.994
Did you ever consider
that perhaps it's because

16:11.061 --> 16:13.562
you enjoyed
having me around?

16:13.614 --> 16:14.580
Admit it.

16:14.648 --> 16:17.500
You like me, Walter.

16:17.567 --> 16:18.618
Walter, we're setting up.

16:18.702 --> 16:21.587
<i>Dr. Bishop.</i>

16:21.672 --> 16:24.791
Dr. Bishop, your Astrid
is summoning you.

16:24.875 --> 16:27.760
The Fringe team
is at the scene.

16:27.845 --> 16:29.345
The way this woman died--

16:29.413 --> 16:30.847
and I say this
with some experience--

16:30.914 --> 16:33.132
is among the weirdest things
I've ever seen.

16:33.217 --> 16:34.550
She bleeding from her eyes?

16:34.601 --> 16:35.768
How did you know?

16:35.853 --> 16:38.054
There seems to be a lot of that
going around lately.

16:38.105 --> 16:41.224
You mind opening it up?
I'd love to take a look.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.608
Astrix, collect a DNA sample.

16:42.693 --> 16:44.143
Astrid, can you hand me
a cotton swab?

16:44.228 --> 16:47.096
Hang on, Walter.
I wanna get a DNA sample.

16:49.266 --> 16:51.767
- <i>So the cops said--</i>
- Hang on a second.

16:54.538 --> 16:57.707
Seems to be some hemorrhaging
of the nasal passage.

16:57.774 --> 16:59.542
You think maybe
she inhaled something?

16:59.609 --> 17:00.960
Yeah, possibly.

17:01.045 --> 17:04.297
Could be how they delivered
the poison.

17:04.381 --> 17:06.915
- I'm sorry, Walter.
- What were you saying?

17:06.967 --> 17:08.217
Doesn't matter.

17:08.285 --> 17:10.303
But please ask Agent Dunham
to bring the body--

17:10.387 --> 17:12.137
Astrid, we're gonna need
to get this body

17:12.222 --> 17:14.006
back to the lab
to have it examined.

17:14.090 --> 17:15.641
Can you work that out
with the M.E.'s office?

17:15.726 --> 17:17.676
Yeah.

17:17.761 --> 17:20.396
Does he always do
all the jobs?

17:25.519 --> 17:31.574
♪

17:33.360 --> 17:37.864
These scalpels could use
some sharpening.

17:37.948 --> 17:39.615
And you're sharing that
with me why?

17:39.666 --> 17:42.118
I thought you'd
sharpen them for me.

17:42.169 --> 17:43.652
You said you wanted
to help.

17:43.704 --> 17:47.323
I had meant with
the autopsy, Walter.

17:47.374 --> 17:48.374
The screws
in the rib-spreader

17:48.459 --> 17:50.460
could also use
a little tightening.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.963
You're angry with your son.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.431
He is not my son.

18:12.499 --> 18:15.117
As I understand it,
in a different timeline,

18:15.169 --> 18:16.285
he is.

18:16.336 --> 18:19.422
Oh, so he says.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.475
Do you feel love for him?

18:22.559 --> 18:23.626
<i>I have found</i>

18:23.677 --> 18:25.394
that anger inevitably
seems to be conjoined

18:25.462 --> 18:27.230
with emotional investment.

18:27.297 --> 18:31.851
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>that is the case?</i>

18:31.935 --> 18:35.655
Peter is a reminder
of the son I had...

18:35.739 --> 18:38.074
And wish had lived.

18:38.141 --> 18:40.359
But he is not that son.

18:42.145 --> 18:43.946
And that makes you suffer?

18:43.997 --> 18:47.366
Yes.

18:49.953 --> 18:51.671
In that case,
wouldn't it be preferable

18:51.755 --> 18:53.706
if you chose to believe
he was your son?

18:53.790 --> 18:57.009
And then you could love him
and be happy.

19:06.169 --> 19:08.020
I'm sorry, but I'm just not
seeing any connection

19:08.105 --> 19:10.723
between the victims.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.777
Secretary's son.

19:14.844 --> 19:16.529
<i>He's cute, huh?</i>

19:16.613 --> 19:18.614
<i>Bet he's all contradictory</i>
<i>and tricky</i>

19:18.682 --> 19:19.899
like his dad.

19:19.983 --> 19:21.850
Yeah, I imagine
he's just your type.

19:21.902 --> 19:23.903
Actually, no.

19:23.987 --> 19:26.188
Turns out I like
the nice guys.

19:26.240 --> 19:29.525
All right, so neither
of the victims lived

19:29.576 --> 19:30.543
in the same neighborhood.

19:30.627 --> 19:31.711
They didn't go
to the same gym,

19:31.795 --> 19:32.995
and they got
no mutual friends.

19:33.046 --> 19:34.547
Yeah, well, there has to be
a connection.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.031
We just haven't found it yet.

19:36.083 --> 19:38.167
You say that
with such conviction.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.335
Because...?

19:39.386 --> 19:41.337
Because if there isn't
a link,

19:41.388 --> 19:42.638
then we've got a killer
on the loose

19:42.706 --> 19:45.708
and no lead to find him.

19:50.764 --> 19:53.232
Flight 28 to San Antonio

19:53.317 --> 19:56.686
is now boarding
at gate 38-B.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.404
Flight 28 to San Antonio

19:58.488 --> 20:00.823
is now boarding
at gate 38-B.

20:06.062 --> 20:08.063
Have a nice flight.

20:11.835 --> 20:12.901
Look, honey, I'm at
the security thing.

20:12.953 --> 20:14.203
I've gotta call you back,
okay?

20:23.130 --> 20:24.547
Have a nice flight.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.682
Thanks.

20:45.704 --> 20:46.971
I thought the meeting
went really well.

20:47.038 --> 20:49.340
Look, take it down
a notch, okay?

20:49.391 --> 20:51.509
Yeah, yeah, I want to get this
over with, too.

20:51.560 --> 20:53.227
What? No, no.
It's not a ruse.

20:53.312 --> 20:55.313
I told you, I missed the flight
this morning.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.314
<i>There's nothing I can do.</i>

20:56.381 --> 20:58.483
Bill, Bill.
Listen to me.

20:58.550 --> 21:00.067
I'm hanging up the phone
right now.

21:00.152 --> 21:02.069
Call me back when you get
a personality I can deal with.

21:08.243 --> 21:10.828
Can I help you?

21:10.896 --> 21:13.498
Making your next call
will destroy your life.

21:13.565 --> 21:15.399
- Excuse me?
- You'll be driving.

21:15.450 --> 21:16.784
When a taxi cuts you off,

21:16.869 --> 21:18.235
your reaction
won't be quick enough

21:18.287 --> 21:20.404
because you only have
one hand on the wheel.

21:20.455 --> 21:22.874
Oh, okay.
Well, thanks, pal.

21:22.925 --> 21:25.009
But my life really is
none of your business.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.878
Your car is going to flip,

21:26.929 --> 21:29.180
shattering your spinal cord.

21:29.247 --> 21:32.433
You're left a paraplegic,
and with no family,

21:32.518 --> 21:34.101
you end up
in a group home.

21:34.186 --> 21:37.939
The man who runs it
is not...kind.

21:38.023 --> 21:41.025
Your body will be discovered
more than ten hours

21:41.092 --> 21:43.027
after you die.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.779
No one mourns.

21:44.863 --> 21:48.900
I'm going to spare you
from all that misery.

21:48.951 --> 21:51.068
A painless exit
from a living nightmare.

22:03.448 --> 22:05.416
Jared Colin.

22:05.467 --> 22:07.385
Apparently, his attacker
tried to spray him

22:07.452 --> 22:09.620
with some kind of atomizer.

22:09.671 --> 22:11.472
Yeah, that sounds like
our guy.

22:11.557 --> 22:14.124
He said he'd never seen
the man before,

22:14.176 --> 22:16.260
so why?
What's his motive?

22:16.311 --> 22:18.629
Hm. The Feds,
I take it?

22:18.680 --> 22:21.148
Too many years
in this job.

22:21.233 --> 22:23.651
Lawyers and cops--I can spot
you guys a mile away.

22:23.735 --> 22:26.320
Uh, I'm Agent Olivia Dunham,
and this is Peter Bishop.

22:26.405 --> 22:29.073
What can you tell us
about Mr. Colin, Doctor?

22:29.140 --> 22:30.575
Well, it's not good news.

22:30.642 --> 22:32.693
I mean, we saved his life,
but his spinal cord is severed

22:32.778 --> 22:35.746
right below T-1,
so he is not gonna walk again.

22:35.814 --> 22:39.984
Come on.
He's down here.

22:40.052 --> 22:42.036
I wasn't even supposed
to be in town.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.922
I was heading down
to Dallas.

22:44.990 --> 22:49.510
Selling my company
to my scumbag partner,

22:49.595 --> 22:51.829
who for six years
has made my life

22:51.880 --> 22:53.431
a living hell.

22:53.498 --> 22:55.633
Today was gonna be the day
that I started over.

22:55.701 --> 22:59.804
New beginning.

22:59.871 --> 23:02.039
But I had a water bottle
in my carry-on.

23:02.107 --> 23:05.226
By the time the damn T.S.A.
was done with me,

23:05.310 --> 23:09.230
I missed my flight.

23:09.314 --> 23:11.032
Besides his description,

23:11.116 --> 23:13.618
is there anything else
that you can tell us?

23:13.685 --> 23:16.020
Anything that you remember?

23:16.071 --> 23:18.022
He, uh...

23:18.073 --> 23:20.958
He had this weird rod.

23:21.026 --> 23:22.526
It was blue.

23:22.594 --> 23:26.797
And he'd look into it like he
was some kind of fortune teller.

23:26.865 --> 23:28.633
He said I was gonna have
a car accident,

23:28.700 --> 23:31.802
and I was gonna end up
like this.

23:31.870 --> 23:34.889
So this guy predicted
what would happen?

23:34.973 --> 23:38.375
Not exactly, but I guess exactly
doesn't really matter now.

23:44.399 --> 23:48.519
We think it's possible
that the man who attacked you

23:48.570 --> 23:52.073
also killed at least
another two people.

23:52.157 --> 23:55.493
Do you recognize
either of them?

23:55.560 --> 23:57.611
No.

23:57.696 --> 23:59.580
He...

24:01.783 --> 24:05.402
He said he wanted to put me
out of my misery.

24:05.454 --> 24:07.505
Like he was doing
a good deed.

24:07.572 --> 24:10.291
Like he was
some kind of Saint.

24:10.375 --> 24:14.178
I tell ya,
I wish he had.

24:14.245 --> 24:17.765
I wish he'd done it.
I wish he'd killed me.

24:23.922 --> 24:25.189
Nothing to link them.

24:25.256 --> 24:26.440
Period.
Period.

24:26.525 --> 24:27.775
Goose egg.
Goose egg.

24:27.843 --> 24:31.929
Zilch.

24:31.980 --> 24:33.230
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

24:33.281 --> 24:35.099
I'm going to make
a fresh pot.

24:35.150 --> 24:36.650
Coffee.

24:36.735 --> 24:39.203
I understand that has
quite an interesting flavor.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.571
Yeah, I suppose it does.

24:40.622 --> 24:41.906
Have you never had any?

24:41.957 --> 24:43.607
Where I come from,

24:43.658 --> 24:47.444
coffee is very rare
and thus very expensive.

24:47.496 --> 24:50.414
I've never had the privilege.

24:50.465 --> 24:52.717
Yes, I would like that.

24:52.784 --> 24:54.268
Thank you, Astrid.

24:54.336 --> 24:57.138
You're welcome, sweetie.

25:01.760 --> 25:02.927
Did you ask?

25:02.978 --> 25:04.645
I didn't hear you ask.

25:04.730 --> 25:06.263
May I?

25:06.314 --> 25:09.683
Certainly not.

25:09.768 --> 25:12.486
That's right.
You're still mad at me.

25:12.571 --> 25:15.973
Yes, and now you're breaking
my concentration as well.

25:16.024 --> 25:17.958
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:18.026 --> 25:20.094
Were you solving world hunger

25:20.178 --> 25:22.480
or perfecting the perfect
peanut butter milkshake?

25:22.547 --> 25:24.498
<i>If you must know,</i>

25:24.566 --> 25:27.101
I was musing
on our killer.

25:27.185 --> 25:29.720
Agent Dunham reports
that he may be attempting

25:29.771 --> 25:32.022
to put his victims
out of their misery,

25:32.074 --> 25:34.224
and if that's the case,
then his murder weapon of choice

25:34.276 --> 25:35.359
is consistent.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.278
- The tears of Ra?
<i>- Yes.</i>

25:37.362 --> 25:38.829
Painless and instantaneous.

25:38.897 --> 25:40.030
And it begins
to make sense now.

25:40.082 --> 25:42.750
So we're looking for--
for what?

25:42.834 --> 25:44.335
A humanitarian killer?

25:44.402 --> 25:46.670
Or a compassionate one.

25:46.738 --> 25:49.206
Okay, so you're saying
that the killer believes

25:49.257 --> 25:52.093
he is saving his victims
from a lifetime of suffering

25:52.177 --> 25:53.711
by killing them.

25:53.762 --> 25:56.797
That sounds like
an extremely contorted view

25:56.882 --> 25:58.349
of compassion.

25:58.416 --> 26:01.752
Some suffering
is worse than death.

26:03.588 --> 26:05.356
What is Logan International?

26:05.423 --> 26:06.640
It's an airport. Why?

26:06.725 --> 26:08.392
All three victims
traveled through there.

26:08.443 --> 26:10.928
Is that right?
How did you miss that?

26:10.979 --> 26:12.646
<i>I didn't.</i>

26:12.714 --> 26:13.747
They all had
different airlines.

26:13.815 --> 26:15.449
They had
different destinations.

26:15.534 --> 26:17.284
Mr. Williams was what,
two weeks ago?

26:17.369 --> 26:19.069
Carrie Watson was last month.

26:19.121 --> 26:21.605
<i>Yes, their travel vouchers</i>
<i>indicate that.</i>

26:21.656 --> 26:23.607
What is T.S.A.?

26:23.658 --> 26:26.160
Uh, Transportation
Security Administration.

26:26.244 --> 26:28.278
They screen every passenger
for safety.

26:28.330 --> 26:30.798
In that case, correlating
their voucher stamps,

26:30.882 --> 26:32.583
I believe they may each
have been screened

26:32.634 --> 26:35.786
by the same security agent.

26:39.758 --> 26:41.625
<i>She's right.</i>

26:41.676 --> 26:45.095
T.S.A. Badge 0047.

26:52.154 --> 26:53.136
My.

26:55.774 --> 26:57.074
Thank you.
Have a nice flight.

26:57.141 --> 26:58.159
...Ready for departure

26:58.243 --> 26:59.994
at gate 23-A.

27:00.078 --> 27:02.696
All passengers
should now be on board.

27:02.781 --> 27:06.083
Flight 62, Chicago O'Hare
at gate 23-A.

27:15.377 --> 27:17.678
<i>Hey. Stop that man!</i>

27:17.762 --> 27:18.879
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Stop right there!

27:18.964 --> 27:20.097
Federal agents.

27:20.164 --> 27:21.215
<i>We're in pursuit</i>
<i>of a suspect.</i>

27:21.299 --> 27:22.633
Federal regulations.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.501
You either have a boarding pass
or supervised authorization.

27:24.553 --> 27:26.604
Do you want me
to find you a supervisor?

27:33.037 --> 27:34.087
I was surprised the FBI

27:34.155 --> 27:36.874
was doing a background check
on Neil.

27:36.958 --> 27:38.208
Well, to be honest,
we were surprised to learn

27:38.293 --> 27:41.295
that he was previously employed
at a professor at M.I.T.

27:41.346 --> 27:43.096
Yeah, I could tell that
on the phone.

27:43.164 --> 27:45.048
So how does an advanced
mathematics Professor

27:45.133 --> 27:48.135
<i>end up working</i>
<i>for the T.S.A.?</i>

27:50.221 --> 27:51.889
I suppose he loses his mind.

27:55.677 --> 27:57.144
It would be an understatement
to say

27:57.195 --> 27:58.845
that people around here
are driven,

27:58.897 --> 28:00.147
but Neil--
he put 'em all to shame.

28:00.198 --> 28:01.782
He was the youngest
tenure track professor ever.

28:01.849 --> 28:03.016
Brilliant.

28:03.067 --> 28:05.852
And a little bit mad
to begin with, I suppose.

28:05.904 --> 28:07.788
And like most mathematicians,

28:07.855 --> 28:09.623
he believed that math
was the key

28:09.690 --> 28:12.659
to unlocking the secrets
of the universe.

28:12.710 --> 28:13.693
I know how that sounds.

28:13.745 --> 28:15.529
Not nearly as crazy
as you might think.

28:15.580 --> 28:17.915
Well, a couple years ago,

28:17.999 --> 28:20.634
he came back from summer break
at his lake house,

28:20.701 --> 28:23.470
and he was just...changed.

28:23.538 --> 28:25.923
He said that
he'd found something,

28:26.007 --> 28:27.591
although he wouldn't say what.

28:27.675 --> 28:28.708
But he'd become obsessed

28:28.760 --> 28:30.710
with these high-level
differential equations

28:30.762 --> 28:32.012
that no one could make
heads or tails of.

28:32.063 --> 28:33.497
He had a theory

28:33.565 --> 28:35.215
that if he could solve
the equations,

28:35.266 --> 28:38.485
space and time
could be flattened,

28:38.553 --> 28:40.938
so they would all be
on a level plane.

28:41.022 --> 28:43.106
Define that for me
what do you mean by flattened?

28:43.191 --> 28:45.609
Well, that you could
in essence

28:45.693 --> 28:50.163
see past, present,
and future simultaneously.

28:52.367 --> 28:53.750
Well, eventually,
solving the equations

28:53.835 --> 28:55.168
became more important
than class,

28:55.236 --> 28:59.239
and soon, he just left
and didn't come back.

28:59.290 --> 29:01.091
Now, from what I heard,
he went back to the lake house.

29:01.175 --> 29:04.761
But this working
at the T.S.A.?

29:04.846 --> 29:06.463
Now, that surprises me.

29:06.548 --> 29:09.316
<i>Where was that lake house?</i>

29:09.384 --> 29:11.518
I'm not sure, somewhere in
eastern New York, I think.

29:11.586 --> 29:13.053
He wanted his mail forwarded.

29:13.104 --> 29:14.304
Oh, here we are.

29:14.389 --> 29:17.224
Reiden Lake.

29:19.777 --> 29:21.094
<i>When you first appeared</i>
<i>in this timeline,</i>

29:21.145 --> 29:23.480
it was at Reiden Lake.

29:23.565 --> 29:25.098
What's going on, Peter?

29:25.149 --> 29:27.067
The Professor said that Neil
thought he could see

29:27.118 --> 29:29.269
past, present, and future
all at the same time.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.787
That's what the observers do.

29:30.872 --> 29:33.156
We've just never been able
to figure out how they do it.

29:33.241 --> 29:37.377
But in my timeline,
an observer saved my life.

29:37.445 --> 29:39.046
It also happened
at Reiden Lake.

29:39.113 --> 29:40.330
When Walter crossed over
when I was a child

29:40.415 --> 29:42.382
to bring me back to his
universe, the ice broke.

29:42.450 --> 29:43.450
We both fell in.

29:43.501 --> 29:45.552
It was an observer
who pulled us out.

29:45.620 --> 29:48.121
Are you suggesting
that an observer

29:48.172 --> 29:49.506
is somehow behind this?

29:49.591 --> 29:52.559
That--that he's using Neil?

29:52.627 --> 29:53.927
I don't know.

29:53.978 --> 29:55.979
I think we should take
a drive.

30:10.111 --> 30:13.380
What's he doing?

30:13.448 --> 30:17.751
Thinking.

30:17.819 --> 30:21.338
You care for him.

30:21.422 --> 30:24.675
I suppose I do, yeah.

30:24.759 --> 30:28.478
Like a father.

30:28.546 --> 30:31.014
My father...

30:38.389 --> 30:41.391
I cannot get the thought
out of my mind that...

30:48.149 --> 30:50.233
That I couldn't give him
what he wanted

30:50.318 --> 30:53.320
because of the way
that I am.

30:57.358 --> 30:58.858
That he secretly wished

30:58.910 --> 31:02.295
I could love him back in a way
that he could understand.

31:11.005 --> 31:12.639
Do you think if I were
more like you,

31:12.707 --> 31:16.209
he would've loved me more?

31:16.260 --> 31:18.261
If I was normal?

31:28.673 --> 31:32.025
I think I would prefer
this beverage with sugar.

32:09.930 --> 32:11.264
Who leaves their door unlocked

32:11.315 --> 32:12.432
when they're not home?

32:12.483 --> 32:14.484
You're right.
It's not safe.

32:32.637 --> 32:35.222
<i>Well, we're in the right place.</i>

32:41.345 --> 32:42.646
<i>Hey, take a look at this.</i>

32:42.730 --> 32:45.065
<i>Neil was a twin.</i>

32:45.132 --> 32:48.968
His brother and father
were killed in an accident.

32:50.971 --> 32:54.274
<i>So Gandhi,</i>
<i>Joan of Arc,</i>

32:54.325 --> 32:56.610
all the rest of them--
what's the connection?

32:56.661 --> 32:58.445
They're heroes?

32:58.496 --> 33:01.815
What else do they all have
in common?

33:01.866 --> 33:06.119
<i>They're all saviors.</i>

33:06.187 --> 33:08.188
So where is Neil?

33:40.371 --> 33:42.739
Where are you going?

33:47.211 --> 33:48.378
I don't understand.

33:48.462 --> 33:51.898
What do you mean, you are here
to say good-bye?

33:55.020 --> 33:58.090
- Where are you going?
- I told you.

33:58.093 --> 34:01.812
"Where I belong"
is not an answer.

34:04.733 --> 34:07.068
Were you fired again?

34:07.119 --> 34:08.652
I told you, Mom.

34:08.737 --> 34:10.237
I wasn't fired from M.I.T.
I left.

34:19.581 --> 34:22.917
What?

34:22.967 --> 34:26.887
I heard you that night,
you know.

34:26.955 --> 34:29.940
The night Alex died.

34:33.795 --> 34:36.130
You said God took
the wrong one.

34:36.181 --> 34:41.351
"Why did God take my angel?"
You kept saying.

34:41.436 --> 34:44.188
You always resented
that I wasn't Alex.

34:44.272 --> 34:47.408
Not your angel.

34:47.475 --> 34:49.659
I was afraid
that you were right.

34:49.745 --> 34:53.313
That I would never be
good enough.

34:53.364 --> 34:55.282
As good as he was.

34:55.333 --> 34:57.952
But God had a plan.

34:58.003 --> 34:59.787
He let me live
for a reason.

34:59.838 --> 35:01.155
I know that now.

35:01.206 --> 35:04.792
God gave me a way
to see the future.

35:04.843 --> 35:06.961
W-what are you talk--

35:07.012 --> 35:07.962
"what are you talking about?"

35:08.013 --> 35:08.963
"Stop."
Stop.

35:09.014 --> 35:10.297
Don't do that.

35:10.348 --> 35:12.433
"You're scaring me."
You're scaring me.

35:14.970 --> 35:18.139
God gave me a way
to see the future

35:18.190 --> 35:21.208
so I could give people mercy.

35:23.779 --> 35:25.512
Neil...

35:25.564 --> 35:29.016
I'm sorry.

35:29.067 --> 35:31.852
What you heard that night...

35:31.903 --> 35:34.455
about your brother...

35:34.522 --> 35:37.324
You should never
have heard that.

35:37.375 --> 35:40.711
But I did.
And I'm glad.

35:40.796 --> 35:42.963
Every time I saw the
disapproving look in your eye,

35:43.031 --> 35:44.131
it drove me harder

35:44.199 --> 35:46.000
to separate myself
through accomplishment.

35:46.051 --> 35:47.501
That's why God took notice.

35:47.552 --> 35:49.720
Because of you.

35:49.805 --> 35:50.805
Neil.

35:50.872 --> 35:52.389
<i>Please stop this.</i>

35:52.474 --> 35:56.177
Jesus knew the Romans
were coming for him.

35:56.228 --> 35:59.379
<i>He could have avoided</i>
<i>his death so easily.</i>

35:59.431 --> 36:02.233
But he didn't.

36:02.317 --> 36:05.486
He had faith
that God had a plan.

36:05.553 --> 36:09.356
I understand God's plan
for me now.

36:09.407 --> 36:10.858
And I'm willing to go.

36:10.909 --> 36:12.576
<i>FBI. Open this door,</i>

36:12.661 --> 36:13.727
<i>or we're coming in!</i>

36:13.778 --> 36:14.862
FBI?

36:15.947 --> 36:17.731
FBI. Put your hands up.

36:17.782 --> 36:19.416
Don't you remember, Mom,

36:19.501 --> 36:20.835
what the priest said
about Alex at the funeral?

36:20.902 --> 36:22.703
<i>Stand up slowly</i>

36:22.754 --> 36:24.004
<i>and put your hands</i>
<i>behind your head.</i>

36:24.072 --> 36:26.924
He said angels
don't belong on earth.

36:27.008 --> 36:29.009
Keep your hands
where I can see them,

36:29.077 --> 36:32.513
<i>and turn around</i>
<i>very slowly.</i>

36:32.580 --> 36:36.183
I'll see you in heaven.

36:36.251 --> 36:38.269
<i>Agh! No!</i>

36:38.353 --> 36:41.188
<i>No!</i>

36:53.985 --> 36:56.453
Hey, how you holding up?

36:56.538 --> 36:59.907
You know, he wasn't trying
to hit me.

36:59.958 --> 37:03.794
He fired at the window
on purpose.

37:03.879 --> 37:05.445
How do you know that?

37:05.497 --> 37:09.717
I think he knew we were coming,
and he wanted us to shoot him.

37:09.784 --> 37:10.918
I guess it makes sense.

37:10.969 --> 37:13.087
I mean, he could see
the past, present, and future.

37:13.138 --> 37:15.089
But he had a gun.

37:15.140 --> 37:17.457
Why not just shoot himself?

37:17.509 --> 37:20.678
Because he was religious.

37:20.762 --> 37:22.629
If he committed suicide,
he wouldn't be allowed

37:22.681 --> 37:23.731
into heaven.

37:23.798 --> 37:25.566
What about all the people
he killed?

37:25.633 --> 37:26.800
He thought
he was saving them.

37:26.851 --> 37:29.770
This was his way
to become an angel.

37:33.992 --> 37:35.526
Hm.

37:35.610 --> 37:36.911
Peter.

37:36.978 --> 37:39.697
I know it's taken me
some getting used to,

37:39.781 --> 37:41.832
but as long
as you're stuck here,

37:41.917 --> 37:44.952
you make a good partner.

37:45.003 --> 37:47.004
Thank you.

37:50.392 --> 37:52.376
<i>Dr. Bishop, we are leaving.</i>

38:09.477 --> 38:11.612
Hey, Walter.

38:11.679 --> 38:14.615
Here, I want
to show you something.

38:14.682 --> 38:17.284
My ingenious piece
of spy tech.

38:22.040 --> 38:23.073
Mints?

38:24.876 --> 38:26.210
Similar.

38:26.294 --> 38:28.862
They're bobbins.
They're delicious.

38:28.913 --> 38:31.415
It's almost like wintergreen.

38:31.499 --> 38:35.419
Only smokier.

38:35.503 --> 38:36.536
One for the road.

38:36.588 --> 38:38.339
Are you giving me
a send-off?

38:38.390 --> 38:41.225
You may possess
positive qualities

38:41.309 --> 38:43.210
that I previously overlooked.

38:43.261 --> 38:45.846
Are you flirting with me?

38:45.897 --> 38:48.215
In your dreams.

38:56.057 --> 38:58.359
It was really nice
meeting you.

38:58.410 --> 39:01.528
It was amazing, actually.

39:01.579 --> 39:04.698
Yes.

39:04.749 --> 39:07.751
What you said before...

39:12.407 --> 39:15.125
My father...

39:15.210 --> 39:17.294
We're not very close either.

39:22.050 --> 39:24.768
He's a very complex man.

39:24.853 --> 39:28.922
He doesn't really
show emotion.

39:28.973 --> 39:33.277
He does the best
with the tools he has.

39:33.361 --> 39:36.647
That's just how he is.

39:36.731 --> 39:39.733
I know he loves me.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.938
At least, that's what
I tell myself,

39:44.989 --> 39:47.074
even though it doesn't
really seem that way.

39:50.445 --> 39:52.446
You shouldn't regret that you
could've been more for him.

39:56.785 --> 39:58.785
It wasn't you.

40:05.126 --> 40:08.128
Thank you, Agent Farnsworth.

40:13.184 --> 40:15.936
You're welcome,
Agent Farnsworth.

40:44.883 --> 40:46.500
<i>Hey.</i>

40:46.551 --> 40:48.886
Well, look who's here.

40:48.970 --> 40:51.889
Hi, Dad.

40:51.973 --> 40:54.274
Ah. That kinda day, huh?

40:54.342 --> 40:57.177
Yeah. That kind of a day.

40:59.013 --> 41:00.197
Wanna tell me about it?

41:00.281 --> 41:03.016
Yes.

41:03.067 --> 41:04.618
But you know
that I can't.

41:04.685 --> 41:08.188
Yeah. I know.

41:08.239 --> 41:11.458
But at least
I can feed ya.

41:11.526 --> 41:15.862
And I can give my baby girl
a big ol' hug.

41:15.914 --> 41:17.381
Awww.

41:19.751 --> 41:23.053
I love you, Dad.

41:23.138 --> 41:26.140
I love you too, Astrid.

42:01.176 --> 42:03.177
Here it is.

42:10.301 --> 42:12.052
You're right.

42:12.120 --> 42:14.054
It's September's.

42:14.105 --> 42:17.757
He must have lost it
in 1985,

42:17.809 --> 42:20.143
the night he didn't save
the boy.

42:20.228 --> 42:24.364
He'll be interested to know
what happened to it.

42:24.432 --> 42:26.700
There's something else.

42:26.767 --> 42:30.937
It appears that September
did not obey your instructions.

42:33.941 --> 42:35.742
The boy is back.

42:35.793 --> 42:38.812
<i>Peter Bishop has returned.</i>
