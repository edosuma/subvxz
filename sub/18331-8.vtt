-[speaking Spanish] Muy bien.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.233
La leche.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.986
This is too easy.
Give me some advanced Spanish.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.322
[in Spanish]
I hope you never learn Spanish

01:12.405 --> 01:15.241
so Papa and I can talk about you
without you understanding.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.288
[speaking English]
Yes, I would love a hotdog.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.250
[speaking English] You really have
a good ear for Spanish.

01:24.876 --> 01:25.794
Namaste.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.590
And then, I looked at you
and it was so funny!

01:30.673 --> 01:33.593
And then, I looked at you
and it was even funnier!

01:33.676 --> 01:35.053
[cackles wildly]

01:36.054 --> 01:38.306
[cackles wildly]

01:40.683 --> 01:42.519
Oh, gimme a Gibbler Nibbler.

01:42.602 --> 01:43.728
[both] Mmm...

01:45.188 --> 01:46.689
Are we not the cutest?

01:46.773 --> 01:49.234
Absolutely. You are not the cutest.

01:51.820 --> 01:55.365
Hey, Jimmy. Did I tell you
that I wrote a song about you?

01:55.448 --> 01:59.577
Man, just when I think this day
can't get any more magical, poof!

02:00.662 --> 02:02.580
You go and pull a rabbit
out of my heart.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.750
Come here, magic man.

02:05.834 --> 02:06.876
[both] Mmm...

02:07.544 --> 02:10.255
[in Spanish] We get it. Enough.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.134
[speaking English]
No thank you. I'm off carbs.

02:17.053 --> 02:18.930
So, in closing,

02:19.013 --> 02:24.686
88% of corn
was genetically modified in 2011.

02:24.769 --> 02:29.023
That's five times as much
as 20 years ago.

02:29.107 --> 02:29.941
Thank you.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.526
The end.

02:34.779 --> 02:37.323
[Spanish accent] Max, this is so exciting!

02:37.949 --> 02:41.494
Your whole class is coming here
to see your sustainable farm project.

02:41.578 --> 02:45.832
Oh, but the last time they came,
the boys left the bathroom a mess.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.500
They're not great aimers.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.212
Sometimes we're not aiming.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.592
We're having fun peeing our name.

02:59.095 --> 03:03.182
Well, just so you know, my project's
going to win the green ribbon.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.311
Oh, yes, that green ribbon will be mine.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.313
[evil laugh]

03:12.483 --> 03:14.527
Max, it's not about winning.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.362
It's about doing your best.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.031
And never laugh like that again.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.745
Well, word on the jungle gym
is Taylor's the one to beat.

03:23.828 --> 03:26.497
I believe they're talking about it
on the swing set too.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.666
Taylor.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.376
What a pleasant surprise.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.502
Hello, Doctor Fuller.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.420
[sniffs]

03:32.503 --> 03:33.838
Is that a new perfume?

03:33.922 --> 03:35.131
Enchanting.

03:36.174 --> 03:39.219
Yeah, I just picked it up
at Nordstrom Rack and I...

03:39.302 --> 03:40.720
Why am I telling you this?

03:42.430 --> 03:44.557
Hello, I'm Taylor's dad.

03:44.641 --> 03:47.185
And may I just add,
that is a beautiful blouse.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.896
You think so? I find it a little busy.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.399
[whispers] Sorry.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.363
Can I help you with something,
Taylor's dad?

03:58.446 --> 04:00.031
We're just here to scout the venue.

04:00.114 --> 04:03.493
We need lots of space to unveil Taylor's
solar-powered all-terrain vehicle.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.078
Which I built all by myself.

04:05.161 --> 04:06.746
-Right, Dad?
-Right, son.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.585
Anyway, we're gonna need more room.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.754
Can we get rid
of these boxes full of weeds?

04:14.837 --> 04:15.880
Weeds?

04:16.547 --> 04:18.967
This is my sustainable farm, man.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.595
[both laugh]

04:22.679 --> 04:23.930
[both] Adorable.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.395
It so happens that my son
worked very hard on this.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.857
Perhaps you're unaware that he was
the valedictorian of second grade.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.111
Only because Taylor was studying abroad

04:38.194 --> 04:41.197
at the foreign exchange program
for the academically gifted.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.199
Max plays chess.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.576
Taylor teaches chess.

04:47.453 --> 04:50.248
Can I speak to you privately for a moment?

04:52.292 --> 04:55.920
You should really prepare your son
for his inevitable defeat.

04:56.546 --> 05:00.800
It doesn't matter what the outcome is,
as long as he tries hard and has fun.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.302
See, that is so comforting.

05:02.385 --> 05:05.138
That is exactly what
you should say to him when he loses.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.433
Taylor, let's go.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.311
Let's go get a pre-victory snack.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.271
Who wants a McRib?

05:13.354 --> 05:14.480
Winners do!

05:19.777 --> 05:21.237
I have two questions.

05:22.447 --> 05:26.034
Did Taylor really build a solar-powered
ATV all by himself?

05:26.617 --> 05:27.452
And secondly,

05:28.119 --> 05:29.620
McRibs are back?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.584
Yeah! McRibs are back for a limited time!

05:36.753 --> 05:38.129
And no.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.090
Taylor didn't build that thing.
His dad did.

05:44.427 --> 05:48.848
If Taylor's dad can help him win,
then your mom can help you win.

05:48.931 --> 05:51.350
But you said it wasn't about winning.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.435
Oh.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.313
No, that's when I thought
you were going to win.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.149
Cosmo, pay attention.

05:58.232 --> 06:03.112
My girlfriend Lola is bringing her
new dog, Spot, for me to watch overnight,

06:03.196 --> 06:06.824
so I need you to play nicely
and be very careful where you sniff.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.413
Lola wants us both to watch her dog.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.791
I'm her boo, so I'm in charge.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.627
Hey, Mr. In-charge,
your shirt's on backwards.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.255
And inside out.

06:22.381 --> 06:23.216
I know.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.176
Now.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.762
Hi, guys!

06:27.845 --> 06:29.347
Meet Spot!

06:32.141 --> 06:33.351
That's not a dog.

06:35.269 --> 06:36.896
That's a tarantula.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.235
Why would you name a tarantula Spot?

06:42.318 --> 06:44.612
Because when he bites, he leaves a spot!

06:46.781 --> 06:48.366
Ooh, you wanna pet him?

06:49.200 --> 06:51.702
Well, your boo's in charge
so you should probably let him do that.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.705
Oh, no, no... I'm a gentleman.
Ladies first.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.124
I insist.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.544
I gotta go. Here is
a box of crickets for his dinner.

06:59.627 --> 07:04.674
And FYI, he loves being stroked
on his fuzzy little thorax.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.468
Who doesn't?

07:09.637 --> 07:11.597
-Thank you, guys.
-No problem!

07:13.724 --> 07:16.102
Nah, don't worry, I got this, bae.

07:17.770 --> 07:18.771
All right, see ya.

07:18.855 --> 07:19.939
Bye.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.774
I'll give you 20 bucks to watch him.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.445
Let's be grateful
she left her snake at home.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.405
She has a snake too?

07:28.865 --> 07:30.783
Why am I so attracted to bad girls?

07:34.745 --> 07:36.497
All right. Thanks so much, you guys.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.083
This is my new song
with my new band.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.879
And I wrote this song
for my dreamy boyfriend, Jimmy.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.547
It's called "The Boy Next Door."

07:45.131 --> 07:48.426
Because Jimmy grew up next door,
and he's a boy.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.763
Oh, that works on so many levels.

[sighs] Thank you, family
who would cheer for me even if I stunk.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.842
Oh, no you slayed it.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.052
[cries]

09:15.054 --> 09:18.224
I'm sorry, guys. Once I start crying,
there goes the whole day.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.644
I too was deeply moved.

09:21.727 --> 09:25.147
The last time I cried this much
was for Argentina.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.819
People, pull it together.

09:31.362 --> 09:34.949
It's a song, not Toy Story 3.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.953
All right, you guys,
why don't you take a five?

09:39.036 --> 09:42.164
-Steph, I'm so proud of you.
-Thank you.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.750
Hey, will you guys
put Tommy down for a nap?

09:44.834 --> 09:45.668
-Yeah.
-Yeah, sure.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.421
Max, Fernando and I
have a green ribbon to win.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.047
Mom.

09:50.131 --> 09:53.050
If we lose, you'll still love me, right?

09:53.134 --> 09:55.052
Of course I will.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.346
But we're gonna win,
so we don't have to find out.

09:59.724 --> 10:03.978
Steph-osaurus, your song is so good,
you need to share it with the world.

10:04.061 --> 10:06.480
You know, I could make a YouTube video.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.733
Oh, I don't know.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.276
I just wrote this song for you.

10:10.359 --> 10:13.946
Well, it'll be the story of our love
set to your music.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.157
Well, I don't expect
anything to come of this,

10:16.240 --> 10:18.993
but... if it makes you happy,
then it makes me happy.

10:19.076 --> 10:19.994
Great!

10:20.077 --> 10:21.662
I'm already cutting it together
in my head.

10:21.746 --> 10:25.708
It'll be a wide shot and then a close-up
and then a smash-cut, cut to commercial.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.919
Man, it would be nice if there was
some place we could watch entertainment

10:29.003 --> 10:30.338
where there were no commercials.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.261
Hmm...

10:39.221 --> 10:40.931
I'd pay a monthly fee for that.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.187
Mom, I've brushed my teeth
and I'm ready for bed.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.897
What? You wanna go to bed now?

10:47.980 --> 10:49.940
And let Taylor's dad beat me?

10:50.691 --> 10:51.984
Sleep is for losers!

10:52.860 --> 10:56.989
But it's past my bedtime
and I don't wanna be tired tomorrow.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.201
Oh, don't worry.
You're having a Red Bull for breakfast.

11:02.119 --> 11:05.081
Now, come on, let's practice your speech.

11:05.164 --> 11:08.376
I've put a lot of work into it
and I don't want you to screw it up.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.505
But I thought my old speech
was pretty good.

11:12.963 --> 11:16.717
Oh, well, no offense, but... I mean,
it sounded like an 8-year-old wrote it.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.970
Max, I know you're giving a science report

11:20.054 --> 11:22.973
but... nobody wants to hear
a bunch of science!

11:24.642 --> 11:26.268
Then what do they want?

11:26.352 --> 11:28.020
Showbiz.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.902
You know, Spot's kinda cute.

11:35.903 --> 11:39.115
In the "ugliest thing I've ever seen
in my entire life" kinda way.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.118
You like it, you feed it.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.121
We'll do it together.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.872
I'll get the lid and you get the crickets.

11:46.956 --> 11:47.873
OK.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.920
[whines nervously]

11:54.380 --> 11:55.423
We did great!

11:55.506 --> 11:57.258
And we're still alive!

11:57.341 --> 11:59.885
You know,
feeding things makes me hungry.

12:00.553 --> 12:04.723
-Have you ever eaten an insect?
-No. But a ladybug flew up my nose once.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.726
Why does all the cool stuff happen to you?

12:20.156 --> 12:22.158
OK, listen up.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.784
No, don't do that.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.123
All right, class,
we're down to our last presentation

12:29.206 --> 12:31.625
for our One Kid Can
Make A Difference project.

12:31.709 --> 12:36.505
To recap today, Sarah built a windmill
out of her old Barbie dolls.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.215
[clapping]

12:39.842 --> 12:42.887
And who can forget
Taylor and his solar-powered ATV,

12:42.970 --> 12:46.974
which, as he keeps reminding us,
he made all by himself.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.769
Let's hear it for my boy, Taylor!

12:50.853 --> 12:53.189
[cheering]

12:53.272 --> 12:55.357
Next up is Max Fuller.
