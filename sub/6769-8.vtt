{\an3}I came here today--
I want to check him out.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.852
{\an4}You want
to protect her--
that's cute.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.645
She's been on her
own for a while.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.564
{\an3}I tried fixing her
up, but nothing.

10:48.647 --> 10:51.567
{\an4}Someone as eligible as her
can't find happiness?
It's very depressing.

10:51.650 --> 10:54.779
{\an5}Well, you know, it
doesn't bother her,
but it bothers me.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.906
{\an1}Well, maybe
this'll be the one.

10:56.989 --> 10:57.782
I hope so.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.493
(photographers shouting
indistinctly)

11:07.249 --> 11:08.626
{\an6}Aren't you ever
the slightest bit
embarrassed

11:08.709 --> 11:09.543
by what we do?

11:09.627 --> 11:12.296
{\an1}No. She's a celebrity
promoting her show.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.464
{\an1}It's part
of the territory.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.925
See ya later. Thanks.

11:16.008 --> 11:16.926
Hi, Mom.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.552
{\an1}Hi. Oh,
save me, please.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.429
Come on. We have a reservation
at Patina.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.722
Oh, fabulous.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.558
{\an5}Whoa, whoa, whoa, you are
not leaving me, are you?
Oh...

11:24.642 --> 11:25.935
{\an1}I think you can
find a way

11:26.018 --> 11:27.103
{\an1}to charm
the masses.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.438
Steve, this is Barry.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.564
{\an1}Barry,

11:30.648 --> 11:31.857
{\an3}say hello
to my son Steve.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.776
Hello, son Steve.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.277
You're Barry Linman.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.946
{\an3}That's right.
My co-star.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.364
The one you read about.

11:38.447 --> 11:41.492
Yes.

11:41.575 --> 11:43.285
{\an1}Well?
Shall we?

11:43.369 --> 11:44.537
{\an1}Great.

11:46.664 --> 11:47.706
<i>Kelly tells me</i>

11:47.790 --> 11:49.500
David's hired you.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.293
{\an6}Yeah, we start
depositions in
the morning.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.087
So you're a criminal lawyer.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.171
I will be tomorrow.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.423
See, I'm in private practice,

11:55.506 --> 11:57.967
and right now, David is
my only client.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.343
Oh.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.262
Not that I haven't had
lots of clients before,

12:01.345 --> 12:02.638
it's just that I'm in...

12:02.721 --> 12:03.973
A lull.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.474
Exactly.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.435
Um, will you excuse me?

12:07.518 --> 12:09.937
{\an3}I need a little
air. Thanks.

12:13.607 --> 12:15.359
Did you have to interrogate him?

12:15.443 --> 12:16.986
I don't think
that's what I did.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.362
And I know

12:18.446 --> 12:19.822
{\an1}that's not why
you're mad.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.782
I'm not mad.
If anything, I'm sad.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.702
I love Grandpa,
and I'm going to miss him,

12:24.785 --> 12:26.996
but I don't think
he's gonna change his mind.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.164
Well, not if we don't
help him to.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.957
{\an1}Mom, it's his life.
Yeah, and all

12:30.040 --> 12:33.377
I want him to do is to live it
for as long as possible.

12:33.461 --> 12:36.505
I know that this is probably
hard for you; he's your dad,

12:36.589 --> 12:39.592
but he just wants
to die with dignity.

12:39.675 --> 12:40.843
There is no such thing.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.344
For Grandpa, there is.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.179
Well, not for me!

12:43.262 --> 12:44.638
{\an1}And that's
what matters.

12:44.722 --> 12:45.639
How do you figure?

12:45.723 --> 12:47.516
Grandpa has a living will.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.476
It gives me power of attorney.

12:48.559 --> 12:51.020
Yes, but he's written out
what he wants

12:51.103 --> 12:52.646
regarding medical treatment.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.399
Quite specifically;
"Do not resuscitate."

12:55.483 --> 12:57.193
And if and when the time comes,

12:57.276 --> 12:59.028
he's instructed you
to pull the plug.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.029
{\an1}Yes.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.906
And I won't do it.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.874
Hey, I wouldn't do that.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.542
{\an1}You know, those
things can kill you.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.752
Haven't you heard?

13:14.835 --> 13:18.547
Oh, you, uh, you need any help
with the fees with David,

13:18.631 --> 13:19.840
you give me a call.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.717
Yeah, sure.

13:29.558 --> 13:30.684
Dylan, hi.

13:30.768 --> 13:34.063
Um, I thought we could maybe
go for a ride or something.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.731
You met Matt, right?

13:35.814 --> 13:36.857
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.234
We, uh, we bonded.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.610
So come on.

13:42.321 --> 13:46.075
You can't just reappear and
expect me to drop everything.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.910
Why not?

13:47.993 --> 13:50.371
I'm having a family crisis here.

13:50.454 --> 13:51.539
Oh, family crisis, okay.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.916
Uh, well, tomorrow then.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.459
{\an1}Don't you want
to know

13:55.543 --> 13:56.544
what the crisis is?

13:56.627 --> 13:58.504
No, I don't.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.757
A lot of people can help Kelly
with her problems.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.300
I can just help her forget 'em.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.311
Did you use a fake I.D.?

14:14.395 --> 14:16.438
Yes.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.565
How old did it say you were?

14:17.648 --> 14:19.441
Twenty-one.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.569
And now you say my client
should have known you were 17?

14:21.652 --> 14:22.903
Miss O'Lare is here voluntarily.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.197
{\an3}I suggest you save
your arguments for court.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.450
{\an5}Did you call David
while he was on the radio?
Yes.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.120
{\an5}And when you spoke, did he
invite you to the club?
No.

14:31.203 --> 14:31.996
No. And when you went

14:32.079 --> 14:32.955
to the club, did he

14:33.038 --> 14:34.331
{\an1}invite you
to his radio booth?

14:34.415 --> 14:35.791
That's it.
You're twisting things around.

14:35.874 --> 14:37.293
No, what he's doing is
straightening 'em out.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.586
Don't you talk to her.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.462
We're through.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.630
{\an1}David, come on.
Let it go.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.507
How can I? Come on.
David...

14:46.343 --> 14:48.971
{\an1}Denise. Denise,
come on!

14:49.054 --> 14:50.514
Would you tell 'em the truth?

14:50.598 --> 14:52.474
{\an1}We can have you arrested
for this.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.934
Denise!

14:54.018 --> 14:55.603
The court order says 300 feet.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.605
You get any closer to her,
you go to jail!

14:57.688 --> 14:59.440
For a night. Who cares?!

14:59.523 --> 15:00.941
Come on.
I'm looking at three years here!

15:01.025 --> 15:03.611
I wish it was 30.

15:13.537 --> 15:15.331
Oh, it sounds like your

15:15.414 --> 15:17.625
{\an6}agent Mel Levine's
really hustling
for you.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.002
{\an1}I don't know.
"Spokesperson"?

15:20.085 --> 15:22.171
It's good money,
not many hours.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.464
And you actually
like the shampoo.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.507
{\an5}Yeah? You think
I should take
the interview?

15:25.591 --> 15:26.508
{\an3}Yeah.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.011
And in this.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.012
No, I can't do that.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.096
{\an3}Come on.
Hurry up.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.931
Because we only have one day
to make alterations.

15:33.015 --> 15:33.849
Well, it'll be just

15:33.932 --> 15:35.851
like old times;
me wearing your clothes.

15:35.934 --> 15:38.520
Yeah, right. I got all the new
stiff dorky-looking things

15:38.604 --> 15:40.522
and you got them all worn-in
and great-looking.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.692
Yeah, that's exactly
the way I saw it.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.160
Hey.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.704
{\an3}Bad time?
No.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.040
{\an3}If it is,
just let me know.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.042
{\an1}You didn't call me
last night.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.752
{\an3}I didn't think
you wanted me to.

16:01.835 --> 16:02.795
You're my boyfriend.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.546
Of course I want
you to call.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.548
You told me I was
trying too hard.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.467
I just meant that we have
a lot to work on.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.886
{\an1}And with the flowers
that you sent,

16:10.969 --> 16:14.723
I just kinda got the impression
you didn't understand that.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.058
I do understand.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.769
{\an3}I'm not gonna treat you
the way I did before.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.562
I know, but it's

16:20.646 --> 16:24.400
not forgotten,
and I, I still

16:24.483 --> 16:25.526
feel angry towards you.

16:25.609 --> 16:28.445
And that's gonna take a while
to get over, you know?

16:28.529 --> 16:29.279
In the meantime?

16:29.363 --> 16:32.408
I need you to make me
feel secure,

16:32.491 --> 16:34.201
make me feel safe.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.453
In other words,
I'm on probation here.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.580
Yeah, I guess you could
call it that.

16:38.664 --> 16:39.790
You're not gonna let me forget,
are you?

16:39.873 --> 16:42.251
No, not in a week.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.420
Other people would.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.255
Well, you're not going out
with other people.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.799
Other people who weren't so,
uh, spoiled.

16:48.882 --> 16:49.758
What?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.052
Maybe you should go.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.679
All right.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.612
I'm sorry.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.156
Look at you.
That fits perfectly.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.907
I-I can't believe that
he called you spoiled.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.952
I mean, how could he say
something like that?

17:17.035 --> 17:20.247
I don't know.

17:30.382 --> 17:31.425
Hey, man.

17:31.508 --> 17:32.426
{\an3}Hi.

17:32.509 --> 17:34.303
Nice place.

17:34.386 --> 17:37.139
Hear anything from lawyer boy?

17:37.222 --> 17:38.474
{\an3}Not yet.
Figures.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.601
He's a nice guy.

17:40.684 --> 17:44.271
Well, somebody's gotta be.

17:44.354 --> 17:50.027
David, you are
gonna be fine.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.361
Yeah, I know.

17:51.445 --> 17:52.529
But?

17:52.613 --> 17:53.655
What about her?

17:53.739 --> 17:56.992
{\an3}She's only 17.
Watch it.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.869
You're starting to talk
like somebody who's guilty.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.162
Maybe I am.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.164
Maybe you're not.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.540
Maybe you just
feel that way,

18:03.624 --> 18:04.833
but trust me.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.335
The law does not care.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.170
Yeah? Well, lately,
neither does anybody else.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.505
{\an3}Yeah?

18:09.588 --> 18:11.507
My heart's bleeding
on the inside.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.427
(sighs)

18:15.511 --> 18:18.305
What the hell you been doing
the past three years?

18:21.266 --> 18:22.601
I don't know.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.520
Feeling guilty, mostly.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.523
You know, I've been meaning
to ask you.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.191
Um...

18:29.274 --> 18:30.859
{\an1}you still think
of your wife?

18:30.943 --> 18:32.528
Her murder?

18:32.611 --> 18:34.363
I do.

18:34.446 --> 18:35.572
I, uh...

18:35.656 --> 18:38.867
I'm getting better, though,
'cause I only think about her,

18:38.951 --> 18:41.537
I guess, every other minute.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.170
JANET:
<i>Hey?</i>

18:50.254 --> 18:53.006
When your mom gets
here, just be nice.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.216
Why wouldn't I be nice?

18:54.299 --> 18:55.425
I mean, just because
she's dating a child

18:55.509 --> 18:56.677
is no reason to not be nice.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.679
{\an1}Right?
Barry's cute.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.264
{\an3}He's not exactly the
father-figure type

19:00.347 --> 19:01.515
{\an3}that you were
hoping for,

19:01.598 --> 19:03.725
but she could do worse...
I think.

19:03.809 --> 19:04.935
{\an1}She's

19:05.018 --> 19:06.895
selfish-- she's always been.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.731
She doesn't give thought to how
her actions affect other people.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.234
Look, this isn't about
other people, Steve.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.735
It's about me.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.863
Forgive me, Mother,

19:15.946 --> 19:17.573
but Barry could be my brother.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.284
As if your father hasn't dated
women who could be your sister.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.368
That's different.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.619
(phone ringing)

19:22.703 --> 19:23.954
It shouldn't be.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.247
(sighs)

19:25.330 --> 19:27.916
Jack Nicholson dates
Helen Hunt in a movie

19:28.000 --> 19:29.418
and wins an Oscar.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.627
Uh-huh?

19:30.711 --> 19:32.254
{\an4}SAMANTHA:
Michael Douglas is paired
with Gwyneth Paltrow,

19:32.337 --> 19:33.505
and no one says a word.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.883
{\an6}SAMANTHA:
But when an older woman
is with a younger man,

19:35.966 --> 19:38.260
all hell breaks lose.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.553
Are you telling me
you and Barry are serious?

19:39.636 --> 19:40.762
Does it matter?

19:40.846 --> 19:42.556
I mean, if I'm happy,

19:42.639 --> 19:44.600
do you really care
who it's with?

19:44.683 --> 19:46.310
Yeah, I do.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.437
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.731
Uh, Steve, that
was a stringer.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.482
He says he has a possible
lead on a paternity suit,

19:52.566 --> 19:53.442
{\an3}and it involves
someone big, so...

19:53.525 --> 19:56.278
{\an1}What if I disapprove
of what makes you happy?

19:56.361 --> 19:59.114
You have no right to judge me,
and neither does anyone else.

19:59.197 --> 20:00.741
He's on hold.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.159
Say no.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.120
{\an1}STEVE:
500 words.

20:05.203 --> 20:05.913
A buck a word.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.247
{\an1}Double it

20:07.331 --> 20:08.498
if he's got a picture
of the kid.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.671
(sighs)

20:14.755 --> 20:16.882
KELLY:
<i>So my mom's standing</i>

20:16.965 --> 20:18.717
{\an1}there, screaming
at the top of her lungs,

20:18.800 --> 20:20.177
{\an1}"You'll kill Grandpa
if you tell him."

20:20.260 --> 20:21.219
{\an3}He deserves
to know.

20:21.303 --> 20:24.473
That's what I think,
but I don't know anymore.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.141
Well, it must feel awful
being stuck in the middle,

20:26.224 --> 20:27.309
but that's where you are.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.769
Either way I go,
somebody gets hurt.

20:28.852 --> 20:30.812
{\an4}Well, you know what
you have to do.
(sighs)

20:30.896 --> 20:33.315
Yeah. I'm just nowhere near
ready to do it.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.613
Hypothetically,

20:39.696 --> 20:41.490
if I told you
there is this

20:41.573 --> 20:43.492
really cute guy waiting
for you in the courtyard,

20:43.575 --> 20:45.327
who would you want it to be?

20:45.410 --> 20:47.496
If it could be anybody?

20:47.579 --> 20:49.331
I'll narrow it down for you.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.166
Matt or Dylan?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.502
Okay, there's nothing going on
between me and Dylan.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.795
Oh. Okay.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.546
Then your answer is Matt?

20:57.589 --> 20:58.715
{\an3}Or not.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.559
{\an3}So you ready to be taken
away from all your troubles?

21:09.643 --> 21:12.521
{\an1}That depends. You ready
to listen to them?

21:12.604 --> 21:13.563
{\an3}(sighs)

21:13.647 --> 21:16.441
Okay. All right.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.319
(sighs)

21:19.403 --> 21:20.612
So, start with Brandon.

21:20.696 --> 21:21.863
{\an3}Brandon?

21:21.947 --> 21:24.491
{\an1}Uh-huh.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.035
Brandon and I were best friends,

21:27.119 --> 21:29.705
{\an3}but we didn't swing
from chandeliers.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.540
(quiet laugh)

21:31.623 --> 21:33.500
{\an1}What?
Oh, nothing.

21:33.583 --> 21:34.626
It's just, uh,

21:34.710 --> 21:38.213
well, you and I have been a lot
of things to each other

21:38.296 --> 21:40.215
over the years, Kel.

21:40.298 --> 21:41.383
Never best friends.

21:41.466 --> 21:44.094
Now, as far as chandeliers go...

21:45.137 --> 21:46.930
I have a vague recollection.

21:47.014 --> 21:51.351
Yeah. So what you're saying is
that, uh, somehow I came

21:51.435 --> 21:52.561
between you two?

21:52.644 --> 21:53.770
No, that's not what I'm saying.

21:53.854 --> 21:54.563
Isn't it?

21:54.646 --> 21:57.190
No.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.568
I mean, not exactly.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.069
What do you mean?

22:01.153 --> 22:03.405
{\an3}You know, this has
nothing to do with you.

22:03.488 --> 22:07.909
You missed what we had.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.077
No.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.080
What we had was missing
from what I had with Brandon.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.915
You missed that?

22:13.999 --> 22:15.625
Yes.

22:15.709 --> 22:18.086
Good, now that we got
that figured out...

22:20.839 --> 22:23.467
So, you still haven't told me
why you're back.

22:23.550 --> 22:24.926
I sold the house.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.096
So, I'll be staying
at The Peninsula.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.306
Why don't you come by

22:29.389 --> 22:31.767
and we'll have dinner?

22:31.850 --> 22:35.562
Your being here scares me.

22:35.645 --> 22:37.439
{\an3}Why?

22:37.522 --> 22:40.317
I hadn't planned on it.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.549
Sorry, door was open.

23:04.633 --> 23:05.675
That's okay, what's up?

23:05.759 --> 23:09.137
I just came by to see
if you wanted to have dinner.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.264
I'd love to.
Great.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.850
The only problem is
I already have plans with Donna.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.311
Oh.

23:16.394 --> 23:18.021
Gina, it just keeps getting
harder and harder, you know?

23:18.105 --> 23:20.440
One step forward, two back.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.317
Sorry it's been so hard.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.485
{\an3}(sighs)
And you're right.

23:23.568 --> 23:24.945
{\an3}I mean, she's not
gonna let me forget.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.196
{\an1}Oh, so you're taking
her out to dinner.

23:26.279 --> 23:27.447
That makes a lot of sense.

23:27.531 --> 23:28.907
I'm open to suggestions
here, okay?

23:28.990 --> 23:33.495
Well, you could always
just break up with her.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.163
I mean, her standards
are impossibly high

23:35.247 --> 23:37.332
and there's no way
we can ever measure up.

23:37.415 --> 23:39.376
Hey, you know

23:39.459 --> 23:41.294
I'm just kidding, right?
About the breaking up thing.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.587
It's just...

23:44.589 --> 23:45.882
Sometimes she makes me
want to scream.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.467
I know that feeling.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.343
Isn't it the worst?

23:48.426 --> 23:51.513
Let me walk you
to your car, come on.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.682
{\an3}Have you heard
a word I just said?

23:53.765 --> 23:54.850
Yeah, stuff about standards.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.310
Look, I've got work at the club
before I go out tonight.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.020
That's a great dress.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.148
One of Donna's?

24:14.494 --> 24:16.371
{\an3}Oh, yeah, your stuff's
in the mail room.

24:16.454 --> 24:18.540
I'm only six weeks behind
on rent.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.584
Got the day to move it
or I throw it out.

24:20.667 --> 24:21.877
Don't throw it out. I'll...

24:21.960 --> 24:23.336
I'll take it to my office.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.337
{\an1}Oh, like you got one.
Come on, sir,

24:24.421 --> 24:25.505
you don't want to do this.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.216
You know, you haven't even
filed an unlawful detainer.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.093
Do you know what that is?
I could take you to court.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.553
You can't even afford
your nut.

24:31.636 --> 24:32.721
How are you gonna afford
a lawyer?

24:32.804 --> 24:33.930
I <i> am</i> a lawyer.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.057
Parents must be real proud.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.197
Hi.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.742
Mom said you're having
a good day.

24:53.825 --> 24:56.077
{\an3}Never felt better.
Good.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.579
What is all this?

24:57.662 --> 24:59.706
Old pictures.

24:59.789 --> 25:02.042
People never know
who are in them.

25:02.125 --> 25:05.295
{\an1}Ah, so you're writing
their names on the back.

25:05.378 --> 25:06.630
That's a good idea.

25:06.713 --> 25:09.090
I don't want people to forget.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.759
Your great grandfather

25:10.842 --> 25:15.055
had a farm in the middle of
where Beverly Hills is today.

25:15.138 --> 25:17.057
That must be you.

25:17.140 --> 25:21.269
{\an1}Yeah, the one
with the cigarette.

25:21.353 --> 25:24.439
A month later, I volunteered
for the war.

25:24.522 --> 25:27.025
Had never been away from home.

25:27.108 --> 25:30.445
Six weeks later, I landed
at Normandy on D-day.

25:30.528 --> 25:33.073
You're such a survivor, Grandpa.

25:34.699 --> 25:39.454
{\an3}About the surgery, you think
I'm doing the wrong thing?

25:39.537 --> 25:42.582
There's no right
or wrong answer.

25:42.666 --> 25:45.794
That's why it's so hard
to know what to do, you know?

25:45.877 --> 25:48.296
{\an3}Did I ever tell you
about the time

25:48.380 --> 25:51.466
{\an3}the German squad
had us surrounded?

25:51.549 --> 25:54.135
{\an1}No, and I want to hear
all about it.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.303
{\an1}But first,

25:55.387 --> 25:58.473
I need to tell you something.

25:58.556 --> 26:00.350
It's about Mom.

26:03.853 --> 26:07.023
♪ ♪

26:08.024 --> 26:09.359
Any update yet?

26:09.442 --> 26:11.069
Yeah, trial date's been set.

26:11.152 --> 26:12.654
Two weeks.

26:12.737 --> 26:14.155
{\an3}And you know it's your word
against hers, right?

26:14.239 --> 26:15.657
Not about whether we had sex.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.450
{\an3}About whether or not
she was into it.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.619
(chuckles)

26:19.703 --> 26:20.662
"I know she's only 17,
Your Honor,

26:20.745 --> 26:22.789
but she was into it."

26:22.872 --> 26:24.040
Yeah, that'll fly.

26:24.124 --> 26:27.002
Think this guy
can defend you?

26:27.085 --> 26:28.586
Seems pretty smart.

26:28.670 --> 26:29.713
Kelly thinks so.

26:29.796 --> 26:31.506
Do tell.

26:31.589 --> 26:33.717
Sure, soon as you admit
she's why you came back.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.680
I think I need a refill.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.849
I'm just saying, lots of papers
have attorneys on retainer.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.642
Maybe, but we're
not one of them.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.519
{\an3}First amendment,
libel, defamation.

26:44.602 --> 26:45.937
{\an1}Look, I wish
I could help you.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.439
But I can't, I'm sorry.

26:47.522 --> 26:48.982
{\an1}Good luck.

26:49.065 --> 26:50.358
Thanks.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.036
Uh, Mrs. Teasley, did you take
a wrong turn out of study hall?

27:01.119 --> 27:02.537
No.

27:02.620 --> 27:03.830
You said David hadn't changed

27:03.913 --> 27:05.623
so I thought
I'd come see for myself.

27:05.707 --> 27:06.333
{\an3}Good.

27:06.416 --> 27:07.876
He's, uh, he's around somewhere,

27:07.959 --> 27:10.587
but the, uh, the radio show
is put on hold

27:10.670 --> 27:12.213
as he is guilty
till proven innocent.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.548
Denise is a fine student.

27:13.631 --> 27:14.883
David's a nice guy.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.551
She's had a bad year, though.

27:16.634 --> 27:17.594
I don't really know why.

27:17.677 --> 27:19.596
I think it has something
to do with her parents.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.222
Hmm, too pushy?

27:21.306 --> 27:22.349
The opposite.

27:22.432 --> 27:23.558
I feel terrible for Denise.

27:23.641 --> 27:25.852
It's as if they
completely ignore her.

27:27.854 --> 27:30.231
{\an1}How much younger
is Denise, anyway?

27:30.315 --> 27:32.776
Six years.

27:32.859 --> 27:35.320
You know how much younger
Barry is than my mother?

27:35.403 --> 27:36.696
26 years!

27:36.780 --> 27:38.573
Talk about robbing a cradle.

27:38.656 --> 27:40.075
Steve, it's not what David did.

27:40.158 --> 27:41.284
{\an1}Thank you.
I know.

27:41.368 --> 27:42.744
I know.

27:42.827 --> 27:43.745
Huh...

27:43.828 --> 27:45.246
Look at that.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.915
There's the guy, Barry.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.249
And he's with some girl.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.751
So, you said you didn't
want him with your mom.

27:49.834 --> 27:50.960
Well, yeah.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.380
But I don't want him
cheating on her either.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.388
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

28:01.471 --> 28:02.931
I'm sorry, do I know you?

28:03.014 --> 28:04.265
Yeah, I'm Steve Sanders.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.892
Samantha Sanders' son.
Sure.

28:05.975 --> 28:06.935
{\an3}You remember
Samantha, right?

28:07.018 --> 28:08.269
Sure, yeah.

28:08.353 --> 28:09.604
Now could you excuse us?

28:09.687 --> 28:11.564
{\an5}Thanks.
Does she know
you're here?

28:11.648 --> 28:13.525
No, and I really don't think
it's any of her business.

28:15.485 --> 28:16.653
Son of a bitch! Come on!

28:16.736 --> 28:19.072
{\an3}You want some more?!
Bring it on!

28:19.155 --> 28:20.156
Right here, baby! Right here!

28:20.240 --> 28:21.658
{\an3}Let me go!

28:21.741 --> 28:24.577
Mrs. Teasley!
Steve Sanders.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.121
Some things never change.

28:26.204 --> 28:28.081
(panting)

28:28.164 --> 28:29.541
You cool?

28:31.501 --> 28:33.670
I'm just saying I think you're
letting Noah off too easy.

28:33.753 --> 28:36.840
Well, I think he's changed.

28:36.923 --> 28:38.633
So, why did you throw away

28:38.716 --> 28:40.635
his latest peace
offering again?

28:40.718 --> 28:43.638
Because what he did
still bothers me.

28:43.721 --> 28:47.475
Which is why you invited him
over for dinner.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.769
Look, I stayed with Noah
because he was almost the guy

28:49.853 --> 28:51.521
that I thought he could be.

28:51.604 --> 28:54.524
And now I think maybe
he <i> is</i> that guy.

28:56.526 --> 28:58.528
Oh, candles.

28:58.611 --> 29:01.322
They're in my room.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.491
(phone ringing)

29:03.575 --> 29:06.494
{\an5}(answering machine):
No one's home,
please leave a message.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.163
Hey, it's Noah.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.498
Look, all hell just
broke loose at the club.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.208
I know I'm supposed
to be there at 9:00

29:12.292 --> 29:13.501
but it looks like I'll be
at least an hour late.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.379
I am so sorry.

29:21.468 --> 29:22.802
Who was that?

29:22.886 --> 29:25.013
Oh, credit card solicitation.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.473
Hate them.

29:29.058 --> 29:30.852
(beeping)

29:33.104 --> 29:34.522
{\an3}Gina,

29:34.606 --> 29:37.150
look, I know you're telling me
to be cautious of Noah

29:37.233 --> 29:40.236
because you're
looking out for me.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.489
I just want you to know
that I appreciate it.

29:42.572 --> 29:46.367
Just promise me you'll hold him
to a high standard.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.536
{\an1}I promise.
Good.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.413
All right, I'm gonna
take off before he shows up.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.539
Is it almost 9:00?

29:51.623 --> 29:52.665
It's 10 of.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.250
And any guy who wants to
impress you as much as Noah

29:54.334 --> 29:56.044
wouldn't dare show up late.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.504
I'll see you.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.839
Bye.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.049
(sighing)

30:01.132 --> 30:03.092
<i>County General?</i>

30:03.176 --> 30:06.513
Uh, yeah, I saw where there was

30:06.596 --> 30:08.556
a commuter train derailment
this afternoon.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.351
Were the victims treated there?

30:11.434 --> 30:13.394
Uh, why do I want to know?

30:18.942 --> 30:21.402
Because I'm an
ambulance-chasing jerk!

30:21.486 --> 30:22.737
(knocking on door)

30:25.782 --> 30:27.492
(sighing)

30:32.247 --> 30:33.206
Hi.
Hi.

30:33.289 --> 30:35.083
I called your apartment
and there was no answer.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.376
And no answering machine.

30:36.459 --> 30:37.377
Must be unplugged.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.754
{\an1}My office is a mess,
let's, uh, talk downstairs.

30:44.384 --> 30:46.302
So, how's your grandfather?

30:46.386 --> 30:51.432
{\an4}Well, I told him
that my mom wasn't going
to honor his living will.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.434
{\an3}I'm sorry.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.311
{\an3}I know it must've
been difficult.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.729
Yeah.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.731
It felt like a betrayal.

30:58.815 --> 31:01.442
A living will
is a legal document

31:01.526 --> 31:03.403
and disregarding it
is against the law.

31:03.486 --> 31:07.448
I know.

31:07.532 --> 31:10.577
{\an3}Kelly, your grandfather made
this choice rationally.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.495
And you're right to make sure
that it's honored.

31:12.579 --> 31:15.331
Thank you for seeing things
so clearly.

31:15.415 --> 31:18.459
Well, I'm not
in the middle of it.

31:18.543 --> 31:21.462
{\an3}Makes knowing what to do
a little easier.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.131
{\an3}Hmm.

31:27.343 --> 31:30.471
You know, uh, about Dylan...

31:30.555 --> 31:32.599
{\an3}I'm not in the middle
there either.

31:32.682 --> 31:34.267
There's nothing to be
in the middle of.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.603
Well, you seem to be
the only one who thinks so.

31:36.686 --> 31:39.480
Okay, I admit his showing up

31:39.564 --> 31:40.690
did take me a little
by surprise.

31:40.773 --> 31:43.443
Kelly, (chuckles) before you
say anything you don't believe,

31:43.526 --> 31:44.652
listen to me.

31:44.736 --> 31:50.241
{\an3}Whatever you and Dylan need to
work through is fine by me.

31:51.242 --> 31:52.201
'Cause what we've got,

31:52.285 --> 31:56.497
{\an3}I mean, if it has to,
it can wait.

32:18.227 --> 32:19.812
{\an3}NOAH:
Donna.

32:19.896 --> 32:22.106
(sighs)

32:25.193 --> 32:27.028
I'm sorry I'm late.
Save it.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.446
Did you get my message?

32:28.529 --> 32:30.406
Yeah, loud and clear.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.033
{\an1}Come on!
What?

32:32.116 --> 32:32.867
Let's talk about it.

32:32.950 --> 32:35.036
Treat me well,
make me feel important,

32:35.119 --> 32:38.081
safe and secure--
it's Dating 101.

32:38.164 --> 32:39.374
You should know it by now.

32:39.457 --> 32:40.583
Good-bye.

33:03.106 --> 33:06.234
{\an3}Please. Three minutes
is all I ask.

33:06.317 --> 33:07.944
{\an3}Three minutes
against a guy's life.

33:08.027 --> 33:09.946
Make it quick.

33:10.029 --> 33:13.408
Mrs. Teasley says you two
aren't around very much.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.575
{\an1}We don't have
to listen to this.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.577
Yeah, you do, actually.

33:16.661 --> 33:18.246
{\an3}You should pay very
close attention.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.373
You see, when a
teenager feels

33:20.456 --> 33:22.875
{\an3}that her parents aren't
paying attention,

33:22.959 --> 33:25.795
{\an3}she'll do some pretty crazy
things to get noticed.

33:29.465 --> 33:31.884
Slacking off at school,
staying out all night...

33:31.968 --> 33:34.262
eventually sleeping
with an older guy.

33:34.345 --> 33:35.888
You don't know what
you're talking about.

33:35.972 --> 33:37.432
You think you're ignored?

33:37.515 --> 33:39.767
When I was a teenager,

33:39.851 --> 33:40.977
I lived in a hotel.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.812
I wanted my parents' attention.

33:42.895 --> 33:44.480
So I did little things.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.566
No good.

33:46.649 --> 33:47.775
I did bigger things.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.861
You know what I'm saying.

33:49.944 --> 33:51.404
{\an3}This is not
Denise's fault.

33:51.487 --> 33:53.156
No, it's not.

33:53.239 --> 33:54.866
It's yours and yours.

33:54.949 --> 33:57.452
And I'm asking you
to own up to that.

33:57.535 --> 34:01.205
For my friend's sake
and for hers.

34:10.214 --> 34:12.300
JANET:
<i>The actor involved</i>

34:12.382 --> 34:14.635
in the drunk driving incident?
He wasn't.

34:14.719 --> 34:15.969
We said "alleged."

34:16.053 --> 34:16.971
He's suing us for libel.

34:17.054 --> 34:19.014
What? Can he win that case?

34:19.098 --> 34:21.266
Depends.
Do you have a good lawyer

34:21.350 --> 34:22.476
on retainer?

34:22.560 --> 34:23.770
Just how bad off are you?

34:23.853 --> 34:26.272
I'm short $1,500 a month.

34:26.355 --> 34:29.692
Coincidentally enough,
my rent is $1,500 a month.

34:29.775 --> 34:31.819
At least it was
until I got evicted.

34:31.902 --> 34:33.321
I'll tell you what.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.489
You provide legal services,

34:34.572 --> 34:35.947
{\an3}I'll give you a
free place to stay.

34:36.032 --> 34:37.909
What do you say?

34:37.992 --> 34:39.327
You got yourself a lawyer.

34:39.409 --> 34:40.661
{\an3}All right.

34:40.745 --> 34:41.829
I heard about
what happened

34:41.913 --> 34:43.998
with Barry.
Have you lost your mind?

34:44.081 --> 34:45.291
He was hitting on another girl.

34:45.373 --> 34:46.458
I don't care.

34:46.542 --> 34:49.003
Well, I do.

34:49.085 --> 34:51.130
{\an3}Would you excuse
us, please?

34:52.297 --> 34:55.342
{\an1}Mother, dear, I was
defending your honor.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.386
{\an3}Oh, Steve. I'm
not dating Barry.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.680
Wait a minute.
I read that...

34:59.764 --> 35:02.141
{\an3}I told you, don't believe
everything you read.

35:02.225 --> 35:03.309
{\an1}You never told me
you weren't dating him.

35:03.392 --> 35:06.979
What I said was, "Whoever I
date is no one's business,

35:07.063 --> 35:08.981
and no one should
judge me for it."

35:09.065 --> 35:10.566
Are you dating someone?

35:10.650 --> 35:12.401
{\an1}Yes.
Are they over 30?

35:12.485 --> 35:13.820
Forty-eight.

35:13.903 --> 35:15.363
Thank God.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.532
Before you rejoice, there's
something you should know.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.368
Something I've been trying to
tell you for the last few days.

35:20.451 --> 35:22.245
{\an1}Well, spit it out, Mom.
After the scare with Barry,

35:22.328 --> 35:24.372
I think I can handle
just about anything.

35:24.455 --> 35:25.706
{\an3}I hope so.

35:25.790 --> 35:26.833
The person I'm dating...

35:26.916 --> 35:28.042
{\an1}Yeah?

35:28.125 --> 35:30.127
Her name is Linda.

35:30.211 --> 35:31.671
Her?

35:31.754 --> 35:34.048
{\an3}I know this is difficult
for you to hear,

35:34.132 --> 35:37.176
but I need your understanding.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.428
I'm gay.

35:48.187 --> 35:49.730
NOAH (on machine):
It's Noah.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.524
(machine beeps)
Will you pick up?

35:51.607 --> 35:52.733
(beeps)

35:52.817 --> 35:53.943
Just let me explain.

35:54.026 --> 35:55.278
(beeps)

35:55.361 --> 35:56.571
Donna.
(beeps)

35:56.654 --> 35:58.531
{\an1}Oh, I don't know why
you're torturing yourself.

35:58.614 --> 36:00.199
All these messages

36:00.283 --> 36:02.577
{\an3}he left after I saw him,
but he said he called before

36:02.660 --> 36:03.244
to say he'd be late.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.204
{\an1}Yeah, but obviously,
he didn't.

36:05.288 --> 36:06.873
Yeah.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.207
(phone ringing, Gina groans)

36:08.291 --> 36:09.250
{\an1}When you're done
listening to excuses,

36:09.333 --> 36:10.793
I'll be out on the beach.

36:10.877 --> 36:13.296
(ringing continues)

36:13.379 --> 36:14.589
Hello?

36:14.672 --> 36:17.800
Uh, no, no. Hold on.
I'll get her.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.595
Sure, I can take a message.

36:20.678 --> 36:22.889
{\an1}Gina!

36:22.972 --> 36:25.600
{\an3}Oh, hey.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.560
{\an3}What did Noah promise
you this time?

36:27.643 --> 36:30.479
{\an1}It wasn't Noah.
It was Mel Levine.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.023
Oh.

36:32.106 --> 36:33.983
The guy that you said
was your agent.

36:34.066 --> 36:35.985
He said he appreciates
your persistence,

36:36.068 --> 36:38.029
but he's not interested
in representing you.

36:39.530 --> 36:40.907
No spokesperson job, right?

36:40.990 --> 36:43.701
Sorry.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.245
I lied.

36:46.329 --> 36:48.623
It's just that...

36:48.706 --> 36:50.791
I have nothing and I'm around
people who have everything.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.960
That must be hard.

36:53.044 --> 36:53.794
You have no idea.

36:53.878 --> 36:55.963
{\an3}I think I do.
No. Come on, Donna.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.257
You have everything.
You have this amazing career.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.593
You have this cute,
successful boyfriend.

37:00.676 --> 37:02.345
Wait.
From the advice you gave me,

37:02.428 --> 37:03.679
I thought you didn't like him.

37:03.763 --> 37:04.680
{\an3}Yeah, well, I think
he's great, okay?

37:04.764 --> 37:06.432
{\an3}And I hope you two live
happily ever after.

37:06.515 --> 37:07.975
{\an1}Gina.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.811
{\an1}I think you're smart.
I think you're talented.

37:12.605 --> 37:15.107
I'm just so not
in need of your pity.

37:16.859 --> 37:18.319
I'll just see you
at the store, okay?

37:22.865 --> 37:24.951
(breathing heavily)

37:25.034 --> 37:26.494
Hi, Grandpa.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.996
Oh, there she is.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.831
You remember Matt?
Nice to see you again.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.500
I hope you're happy.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.335
{\an3}About what?

37:34.418 --> 37:35.503
Oh, like you don't already know.

37:35.586 --> 37:38.172
{\an4}Maybe I should wait
outside, okay?
Yeah.

37:38.255 --> 37:39.173
{\an3}I talked to

37:39.257 --> 37:40.716
your mom about the living will.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.510
I'm sorry.

37:42.593 --> 37:45.179
I felt like he should know.

37:45.262 --> 37:47.139
That wasn't your decision
to make.

37:47.223 --> 37:51.185
I told your mom
I didn't blame her.

37:51.268 --> 37:53.104
{\an3}Asking her
probably

37:53.187 --> 37:54.230
wasn't the thing to do.

37:54.313 --> 37:55.481
She's too close.

37:55.564 --> 37:58.442
So you've given someone else
authority.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.529
To put an end to all this?

38:01.612 --> 38:03.030
Yes.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.658
Who?

38:13.624 --> 38:15.167
Hey.

38:15.251 --> 38:18.170
What is it?

38:18.254 --> 38:21.173
{\an6}I told Grandpa that Mom
wouldn't take him
off life support.

38:21.257 --> 38:23.259
How'd he react?

38:24.468 --> 38:26.512
He asked me to do it.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.854
(knocking on door)

38:36.647 --> 38:38.607
Just hear me out, okay?

38:38.691 --> 38:41.360
Maybe.

38:41.444 --> 38:43.362
{\an3}What happened between
us was wrong.

38:43.446 --> 38:46.073
{\an3}And my parents are still
freaked out by it,

38:46.157 --> 38:47.116
but it wasn't a crime.

38:47.199 --> 38:48.242
No, it wasn't.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.410
That's what I'm saying--

38:49.493 --> 38:52.121
that I won't testify.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.581
Have you told the DA?

38:53.664 --> 38:54.415
{\an3}Yeah.

38:54.498 --> 38:57.293
And he agreed
to drop the charges.

38:58.335 --> 39:00.337
Well, check it out.

39:01.672 --> 39:03.424
I'm a free man.

39:03.507 --> 39:04.425
Thanks to you.

39:04.508 --> 39:06.594
What'd your parents say?

39:07.636 --> 39:09.555
That they'd be
more involved.

39:09.638 --> 39:11.724
It's a start.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.562
I'm so sorry.

39:16.645 --> 39:18.105
(sighs)

39:18.189 --> 39:19.565
I'm sure you are.

39:29.366 --> 39:31.327
What did you say to them?

39:31.410 --> 39:32.286
Not much.

39:32.369 --> 39:34.538
Just that I don't like living
in a hotel.

39:34.622 --> 39:35.915
Still don't.

39:36.916 --> 39:38.959
{\an3}You know, you could
crash here.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.003
{\an5}I mean, I have
an extra room.
Well,

39:41.087 --> 39:44.131
you obviously do need, uh,
some kind of supervision.

39:45.091 --> 39:46.801
I'll get my stuff.

39:46.884 --> 39:47.927
(chuckles)

39:48.010 --> 39:49.970
Hey... thanks.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.722
Yeah.

39:53.557 --> 39:55.559
(snapping fingers)

39:58.187 --> 40:00.189
(phone rings)

40:02.525 --> 40:03.484
Yeah?

40:03.567 --> 40:05.444
Hey. It's me.

40:05.528 --> 40:07.488
Hey, you, uh, checking on David?

40:07.571 --> 40:08.823
'Cause the charges
just got dropped.

40:08.906 --> 40:09.990
Oh, that's great.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.283
Um, I'm glad.

40:11.367 --> 40:12.368
Well, uh, he's in the house.

40:12.451 --> 40:13.327
You want me--
you want to talk to him?

40:13.410 --> 40:15.329
No, I'll, um...

40:15.413 --> 40:16.872
I'll talk to him later.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.499
Okay.

40:18.582 --> 40:22.336
Listen, Dylan,
I was wondering...

40:22.419 --> 40:23.712
What?

40:24.463 --> 40:27.466
Does that offer still stand?

40:27.550 --> 40:29.552
The one where you help me forget
my problems?

40:36.725 --> 40:37.893
{\an3}I'm gonna go get
a cappuccino.

40:37.977 --> 40:40.020
You want one?
Yeah. Whatever.

40:44.233 --> 40:45.609
Donna.

40:47.027 --> 40:49.071
{\an3}Just hear me out one
time then I'll go.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.490
{\an1}DONNA:
Okay, I'm listening.

40:51.574 --> 40:54.368
Whether or not I called
last night is not important.

40:54.451 --> 40:57.037
{\an1}Fact is,
you don't trust me.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.664
Do you blame me?

40:58.747 --> 41:00.040
No, I don't.

41:00.124 --> 41:03.002
{\an1}It's what
I'm getting at here.

41:03.085 --> 41:04.587
{\an1}I want to earn back
your trust.

41:04.670 --> 41:06.005
I'm willing to try.

41:06.088 --> 41:08.632
{\an1}I mean, the least you can do
is give me a shot.

41:08.716 --> 41:09.550
I know.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.969
If you can't, I mean,
just tell me now.

41:14.638 --> 41:16.348
I can.

41:16.432 --> 41:17.516
I want to.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.436
This is for you.

41:22.354 --> 41:23.647
{\an1}DONNA:
Oh.

41:25.107 --> 41:26.984
I love it.

41:36.827 --> 41:40.372
{\an5}KELLY:
My grandfather saw some of the
worst fighting in World War II.

41:40.456 --> 41:42.541
{\an3}Yet most of his
memories are

41:42.625 --> 41:45.544
{\an3}of how beautiful
Europe is.

41:45.628 --> 41:46.921
Yeah, it is.

41:47.004 --> 41:49.924
{\an1}Sometimes
unimaginably so.

41:50.007 --> 41:51.926
{\an3}He went there to
fight a war,

41:52.009 --> 41:53.928
{\an3}when it was over
he came home.

41:54.011 --> 41:56.931
Why did you?

41:57.014 --> 41:58.557
Nice try.

41:58.641 --> 42:00.267
I thought so.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.770
{\an3}Never mind.

42:02.853 --> 42:05.773
You ever hear of a mountain
called K2?

42:05.856 --> 42:07.274
{\an3}No.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.276
I was on an expedition

42:09.360 --> 42:12.279
{\an1}up the face
of that mountain.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.365
Two people died.

42:15.366 --> 42:18.285
{\an1}One of 'em
should've been me.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.287
{\an1}It was about
two years ago.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.373
{\an1}Right after I left
Brenda.

42:24.333 --> 42:26.293
{\an3}You and Brenda have been
apart for two years?

42:26.377 --> 42:27.711
Something like that.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.798
What have you been doing?

42:30.881 --> 42:32.800
I learned to fly.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.051
When I was
in Belgium,

42:34.134 --> 42:37.137
I raced motorcycles
for a while, but...

42:38.597 --> 42:40.474
...the rest of the time
I just tried to forget.

42:40.557 --> 42:43.102
Why?

42:43.185 --> 42:44.311
Seemed like the thing to do.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.855
That's not really an answer,
is it?

42:48.899 --> 42:50.609
It's the only one I've got.

42:50.693 --> 42:52.611
Is that why you came back?

42:52.695 --> 42:54.321
Seemed like the thing to do.

42:55.364 --> 42:58.284
Came back because
this is my home.

42:58.367 --> 42:59.827
I miss my friends.

42:59.910 --> 43:02.329
That's a good answer.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.999
You want a better answer?

43:06.583 --> 43:09.336
I came back
because I missed you.
