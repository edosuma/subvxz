WEBVTT

00:02.878 --> 00:05.214
The Witchfinders served you loyally

00:05.297 --> 00:08.132
and without question
for all the years of your reign,

00:09.051 --> 00:13.347
traveling to the farthest reaches
of the kingdom to rid the world of evil.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.975
Then you rejected the divine doctrines,

00:18.268 --> 00:21.688
tearing us apart
and forcing us into hiding.

00:23.607 --> 00:26.693
Now you say you want us
to serve you once more,

00:26.777 --> 00:29.321
as if all of that never happened?

00:30.656 --> 00:31.865
Yes, that's right.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.118
So I ask you now,

00:36.286 --> 00:38.789
why the fuck would we do that?

00:39.498 --> 00:44.044
Why not just execute you as a heretic
and be done with it?

00:50.133 --> 00:51.593
Lucien is right.

00:52.886 --> 00:56.723
I have caused you all pain and distress.

00:56.807 --> 01:00.519
And for that,
you have my deepest apologies.

01:03.480 --> 01:09.444
My sister, long believed to be dead,
was returned to me.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.282
And in my joy,

01:14.700 --> 01:20.080
and in my gratitude to the God Flame,
I opened my heart.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.209
And my sister bewitched me.

01:25.043 --> 01:28.589
She and her two witch children.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.010
And I lost my way.

01:35.554 --> 01:39.850
Just like you,
I have suffered dearly for it.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.478
I've been in leg irons
for the last nine months.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.647
They starved me. They tortured me.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.733
They took my baby from me.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.199
But it wasn't them.

01:56.658 --> 02:00.579
No, they were merely instruments
of the God Flame herself.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.664
Testing me.

02:03.707 --> 02:07.419
Putting me through trials
to purify my heart once more,

02:08.086 --> 02:12.466
so that I might reclaim my holy kingdom
for the righteous.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.469
And why should we believe you now?

02:17.221 --> 02:18.555
Why should you believe me?

02:22.017 --> 02:23.936
Because I am your queen!

02:29.775 --> 02:31.443
I am your queen,

02:32.986 --> 02:34.696
ordained by God.

02:35.656 --> 02:40.118
And no human will change that.
Not my sister, not the Trivantians.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.203
And not you, Lucien.

02:44.581 --> 02:48.293
It was I who declared war
on the Trivantians,

02:48.377 --> 02:52.756
I who foretold our miraculous victory
at Greenhill Gap.

02:55.050 --> 03:00.389
And since then, my execution
has been called for by Tamacti Jun,

03:01.390 --> 03:05.435
by my sister and her corrupted council,
by the Trivantians.

03:06.061 --> 03:10.524
And yet, somehow, none of them
could manage the simple task

03:10.607 --> 03:12.359
of putting a blade to my throat,

03:13.026 --> 03:15.946
nor could their chains hold me.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.866
And the God Flame sent me out to find you.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.703
You are soldiers with no country…

03:24.580 --> 03:27.082
with no rightful claim to the crown.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.877
One of two fates await you.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.338
You'll either be hunted down
by my sister's army,

03:34.131 --> 03:37.134
or become slaves to the Trivantians.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.887
Why should you believe me?

03:40.762 --> 03:45.601
Because I'm all you've got!
And I love you all!

03:49.479 --> 03:52.482
I am going to take back
the throne of my father.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.487
The God Flame has shown me the way.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.576
And I ask you now.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.036
No, I command you,

04:05.954 --> 04:09.666
in her name, to fight by my side!

04:10.876 --> 04:13.712
To reclaim our holy kingdom!

04:14.546 --> 04:18.050
For God and for yourselves.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.428
My holy warriors!

04:22.471 --> 04:28.227
The true defenders of Paya!

06:09.912 --> 06:10.913
Haniwa.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.333
Did you see him?

06:14.416 --> 06:15.792
-Who?
-Harlan.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.711
-He's out there with the rest of them.
-As a prisoner?

06:17.794 --> 06:19.713
-I don't know, it didn't seem that way.
-Forget Harlan.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.299
When this is over, I will deal with him.
Help me lock this door.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.342
Okay.

06:50.536 --> 06:52.037
All dead, sir.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.121
All of them?

06:54.498 --> 06:56.708
Who was it? Payan soldiers?

06:56.792 --> 06:58.794
If so, none were killed here.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.463
These are all our soldiers.

07:01.547 --> 07:03.215
That doesn't seem likely.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.760
Check the bombs and the children.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.097
Sir.

07:11.890 --> 07:12.891
Set!

07:18.605 --> 07:19.606
Check the house.

07:20.899 --> 07:21.900
Sir!

07:33.453 --> 07:35.122
The door is barricaded.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.499
Barricaded?

07:38.542 --> 07:39.710
So we're not alone.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.599
Keep moving.

07:54.516 --> 07:57.227
Wren, I don't need you here.
Go find Haniwa.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.229
I promised their brother
I'd keep them safe.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.731
We don't have time to argue.

08:01.273 --> 08:02.357
I'm staying.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.819
Fine. You're last. Watch our backs.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.534
Four more dead in the lab.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.869
-And the bombs?
-Secure.

08:57.454 --> 08:58.997
So it's the children in the building?

08:59.081 --> 09:02.209
The children didn't kill
two dozen soldiers. It's something else.

09:02.918 --> 09:05.087
Maybe they have the children with them or…

09:07.923 --> 09:09.174
Captain Armagon.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.886
Tear these grounds apart.

09:13.470 --> 09:14.555
Find those children.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.102
-And Captain, we need them alive.
-Yes, sir.

09:20.185 --> 09:24.398
Tormada, we came here for the bombs.
Let's take them and go.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.441
As always, thinking too small.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.736
Always in the moment, never ahead.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.614
We've already lost Oloman.

09:33.282 --> 09:36.034
Without the other sighted children,
we'll soon be out of bombs.

09:36.785 --> 09:41.248
I didn't spend all that time developing
these explosives to lose my bomb builders.

09:46.295 --> 09:49.173
-Charlotte.
-I hear them. How close?

09:51.967 --> 09:53.051
Too close.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.769
Over by the tree. Now. Go.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.440
Come on. Get low. Get down.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.108
Close your eyes.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.076
You there.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.162
We don't want to hurt the children.

10:21.663 --> 10:22.664
Then walk away.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.083
Kill her!

11:32.025 --> 11:34.945
Everyone okay? All heads accounted for?

11:36.321 --> 11:37.531
-Yes.
-Lu?

11:39.658 --> 11:40.784
I'm good.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.953
Okay. We keep moving.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.539
Okay, come on. Always behind me.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.025
I don't know who you are.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.569
And frankly, I don't care.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.990
But if you have my children in there,
then a deal can be made.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.659
They're not your children.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.329
Sheva.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.374
Look at you all grown up
and leading an insurrection.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.044
-I'm impressed.
-Oh, fuck you!

12:33.462 --> 12:35.339
I don't wanna kill you, Sheva.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.133
But I will if I have to.

12:39.218 --> 12:40.511
You and your family.

12:41.762 --> 12:45.724
Now, whoever's in there with you
may not know me, but you do.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.810
So you know I'm coming through
these doors.

12:56.068 --> 12:58.403
I know you better than you think, Tormada.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.031
I know that voice.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.872
Ranger. My old friend.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.502
How I've missed our sessions together.

13:13.585 --> 13:14.962
Yeah, I know!

13:16.088 --> 13:19.842
That's why I gave you all those scars
to remember me by before I left.

13:20.425 --> 13:21.552
Yes.

13:23.554 --> 13:27.015
And I shall remember to keep you alive
long enough to regret that.

13:27.099 --> 13:29.059
Big talk for such a little shit weasel!

13:52.082 --> 13:55.669
His time will come. I promise you.

13:57.838 --> 14:01.633
Ranger. Are you still there?

14:04.636 --> 14:05.637
No?

14:07.931 --> 14:09.641
Who then am I negotiating with?

14:14.271 --> 14:16.023
This is Baba Voss.

14:18.275 --> 14:19.651
And I'm not negotiating.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.278
Baba Voss.

14:24.031 --> 14:27.075
Quite the band of outlaws
you've assembled, Sheva.

14:27.659 --> 14:31.914
You've done me a great service.
Now I can kill them all at once.

14:31.997 --> 14:34.249
Get these doors open now!

14:36.126 --> 14:37.419
Baba Voss.

14:37.503 --> 14:39.087
A momentary aggravation.

14:39.171 --> 14:41.632
Brought on by your poor impulse control.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.301
I'll admit I misjudged him.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.053
You admit it. What a relief.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.596
-Can I make a suggestion?
-Harlan--

14:47.679 --> 14:49.056
You promised me he wouldn't speak.

14:49.139 --> 14:53.644
Sheva and her family sold Baba Voss's
daughter to the Trivantians, okay?

14:54.686 --> 14:56.438
He has no love for them.

14:57.314 --> 14:59.775
And judging by the arrows
in your soldiers,

14:59.858 --> 15:01.818
I'd say his daughter is here with him.

15:02.486 --> 15:05.989
And if his daughter's here,
you can bet your balls his son is too.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.701
Give him time to understand he's trapped.

15:09.785 --> 15:12.996
He'll give you the girl
to save his children, I guarantee it.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.831
Lord Harlan.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.626
You might be of some use after all.

15:19.253 --> 15:20.420
Baba Voss!

15:22.631 --> 15:25.133
I understand you have
your children with you,

15:25.217 --> 15:30.097
the legendary Haniwa and Kofun
of the battle of Greenhill Gap.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.517
I don't have children, so I'm no expert,

15:33.600 --> 15:37.771
but it seems to me you've got a habit
of putting them in harm's way.

15:39.523 --> 15:41.483
Would you really let your children die

15:41.567 --> 15:44.403
protecting the family
that sold your daughter to Edo?

15:46.280 --> 15:48.615
Return Sheva and her siblings to me,

15:49.658 --> 15:50.951
and I give you my word,

15:52.786 --> 15:54.997
Haniwa and Kofun will live.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.169
But if I have to come in and get them,

16:00.961 --> 16:03.380
then everybody dies.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.718
I'll give you some time to think about it.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.525
I should give myself up.

16:24.735 --> 16:27.696
It was my family that wronged you.
Let me go and make this right.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.578
You were forced to work for that man.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.164
I know him. You know him.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.501
Has he done anything to make you think
that he would keep his word?

16:40.584 --> 16:41.752
-No.
-No.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.921
They're going to get through
that door eventually.

16:44.463 --> 16:45.464
Yes, they will.

16:46.757 --> 16:48.175
So let's be ready for them.

17:28.757 --> 17:29.758
Is that a…?

17:46.441 --> 17:48.569
Son, what is this?

17:49.403 --> 17:50.404
Oil?

17:51.029 --> 17:54.658
No, I think it's fuel.
It's like oil, but it burns faster.

17:54.741 --> 17:55.868
And this one is--

17:56.702 --> 17:58.495
Yeah, it's a lamp.

17:58.579 --> 17:59.997
How do I explain this to you?

18:00.914 --> 18:03.250
It brightens the dark so we can see.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.501
God Flame in your hand.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.296
Not quite,
but it does get really hot like fire.

18:07.379 --> 18:08.380
So be careful.

18:17.181 --> 18:21.476
Barrel, grip, magazine…

18:25.230 --> 18:26.231
trigger.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.945
Only put your finger on the trigger
when you're ready to fire.

18:34.198 --> 18:38.827
And only point at
what you're willing to destroy.

19:14.905 --> 19:15.906
Ranger.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.117
I think we're good.

19:21.453 --> 19:22.955
It's a good day for some killing.

19:24.957 --> 19:27.042
All your talk about fighting
for no nation.

19:27.668 --> 19:28.919
And yet here you are.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.213
I'm not here for Pennsa, I'm here for you.

19:31.296 --> 19:34.550
And you're not here for Pennsa either,
you're here for your family.

19:36.552 --> 19:38.011
That's actually funny.

19:39.805 --> 19:42.683
The fate of an entire kingdom
rests upon the shoulders

19:43.308 --> 19:45.102
of two people
who couldn't care less about it.

19:48.105 --> 19:49.314
What is it?

19:53.735 --> 19:55.904
I can hear your thoughts from over there.

19:57.155 --> 19:58.991
It's what Tormada said about my children.

20:02.870 --> 20:06.707
You have spent your life protecting them.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.751
Only to walk them into danger
again and again.

20:11.545 --> 20:15.966
I've met your children.
They're no longer children.

20:18.594 --> 20:20.179
They walk their own path now.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.599
There comes a time when the choice
is no longer yours.

20:23.682 --> 20:25.434
And that doesn't sit well with you.

20:26.810 --> 20:27.978
No, it does not.

20:28.061 --> 20:33.317
No, it does not, because you are a man who
enjoys telling other people what to do!

20:37.738 --> 20:38.906
Baba Voss…

20:40.949 --> 20:42.910
we may very well die here.

20:45.204 --> 20:49.124
Now, before we do,
there is something I must know.

20:52.961 --> 20:55.380
How is it that I'm never able
to sneak up on you?

20:58.842 --> 21:02.179
It's those giant balls
slamming up against your thighs.

21:04.640 --> 21:08.477
Your left knee creaks every second step.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.561
What?

21:09.645 --> 21:11.313
It's how I can always hear you coming.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.567
Is that true?

21:16.151 --> 21:17.152
Very true.

21:38.090 --> 21:39.466
Make a hole.

22:02.197 --> 22:03.365
Shall we?

22:29.474 --> 22:30.434
Dad?

22:39.234 --> 22:41.153
There's too many walls in there.

22:41.904 --> 22:43.614
I just needed some fresh air.

22:45.449 --> 22:48.243
Yeah, I guess Jerlamarel liked
to close himself off from the world.

22:52.039 --> 22:53.582
It's what the ancestors did.

22:56.168 --> 22:58.337
They thought
they were protecting themselves.

22:59.796 --> 23:02.007
But they
were just locking themselves away.

23:03.509 --> 23:04.510
They were afraid.

23:07.638 --> 23:08.764
They were right to be.

23:10.224 --> 23:14.269
Baba Voss, you're out of time.
Hand over the children.

23:17.898 --> 23:19.608
Seems you misjudged them, Harlan.

23:20.275 --> 23:21.443
Let's go.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.326
You did all you could to save them.

23:31.161 --> 23:33.080
I imagine it won't take very long now.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.793
No. It's gonna take longer than you think.

23:57.896 --> 23:59.106
No resistance.

25:19.394 --> 25:20.395
Haniwa?

25:22.231 --> 25:23.732
-Go.
-Okay.

27:02.122 --> 27:04.833
-How many did you get?
-You go first. How many did you get?

27:04.917 --> 27:06.293
-Same time.
-Okay.

27:06.376 --> 27:07.920
-Six.
-Seven. I win.

27:48.710 --> 27:49.711
Oh, no.

27:54.967 --> 27:55.968
Sheva.

28:13.110 --> 28:15.028
The ringing in your ears will stop soon.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.364
Let's go.

28:22.119 --> 28:23.120
Haniwa.

28:42.055 --> 28:43.182
The bombs?

28:43.265 --> 28:44.683
-Ready to move.
-Follow me.

28:45.309 --> 28:46.310
Set!

30:09.393 --> 30:10.394
What's happening?

30:11.186 --> 30:13.230
You saved my life.
Now I'm gonna save yours.

30:13.313 --> 30:14.815
Stay still. Stay quiet.

30:17.359 --> 30:18.360
You say-- What is this?

30:19.403 --> 30:20.779
Don't move. They're with me.

30:25.784 --> 30:27.870
-What have you done?
-I had to do this.

30:28.871 --> 30:29.872
Guntar.

30:30.455 --> 30:31.540
Harlan.

30:31.623 --> 30:32.624
You're late.

30:34.168 --> 30:36.753
-You're welcome.
-Clear it up. We're moving out.

30:41.717 --> 30:44.511
-If you kill me, they will kill you.
-You betrayed me.

30:44.595 --> 30:45.971
Yeah, you betrayed me first.

30:46.054 --> 30:47.514
I offered you a new life.

30:48.807 --> 30:51.185
Turns out I was kind of attached
to my last one.

30:52.269 --> 30:55.063
We are going to destroy Pennsa
and everyone in it.

30:57.774 --> 30:59.776
Please, Trovere.

31:00.694 --> 31:02.029
Don't make me do this.

31:03.238 --> 31:04.406
Trovere, please.

31:05.490 --> 31:06.950
Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.

31:07.534 --> 31:10.162
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have--

31:19.505 --> 31:20.589
I'm so sorry.

31:21.381 --> 31:24.009
You loved me, didn't you?

31:24.092 --> 31:25.093
At least a little?

31:28.555 --> 31:29.556
You know I did.

31:31.016 --> 31:32.976
You know I did. It's okay.

31:54.831 --> 31:55.832
Dad?

31:57.084 --> 31:59.545
Dad?

31:59.628 --> 32:01.463
Kofun.

32:03.048 --> 32:04.925
-You're okay? Yeah?
-I'm good, Boy. You?

32:05.425 --> 32:06.426
There were more.

32:06.510 --> 32:07.928
There's not.

32:13.100 --> 32:14.101
It's over.

32:14.601 --> 32:17.062
Baba, I've checked all the dead.

32:17.855 --> 32:19.189
Tormada's not here.

32:34.496 --> 32:35.497
Fuck!

32:38.667 --> 32:41.336
Harlan!

32:41.420 --> 32:43.964
Baba. Time's of the essence.

32:44.047 --> 32:45.299
We gotta get the--

32:45.382 --> 32:46.425
Papa. Let him go.

32:46.508 --> 32:48.010
-You let this happen!
-Dad!

32:48.093 --> 32:49.094
I bought you time!

32:49.178 --> 32:51.013
His men killed
the rest of the Trivantians.

32:51.096 --> 32:53.098
-I don't trust you!
-I don't care!

32:53.182 --> 32:54.933
-Where is Tormada?
-He's gone.

32:58.228 --> 32:59.980
-Fuck.
-And he took the bombs.

33:00.063 --> 33:02.941
-Where did he go?
-Fuck! It doesn't matter where he went.

33:03.775 --> 33:06.778
Fucking asshole. We know where he'll go.

33:07.321 --> 33:08.322
Pennsa.

33:09.406 --> 33:12.159
They can't be moving very quickly
if they've got those bombs with them.

33:12.242 --> 33:14.161
-Let's go.
-No, Kofun.

33:14.912 --> 33:16.205
No. We are going after him.

33:16.288 --> 33:17.915
There are numerous routes out of here.

33:17.998 --> 33:20.959
Even if we do manage to track them,
they're gonna be well protected.

33:21.043 --> 33:22.085
We're faster than them.

33:22.169 --> 33:26.340
Which is why we need to get to Pennsa.
Raise the alarm. Meet them with an army.

33:26.423 --> 33:29.176
-Harlan is right.
-What?

33:29.259 --> 33:31.595
If we take them on again,
we will be defeated.

33:31.678 --> 33:32.679
Look, Dad--

33:32.763 --> 33:34.806
Kofun, you are feeling energy
from the fight.

33:34.890 --> 33:37.267
But that will soon fade,
and your body will feel weak.

33:38.435 --> 33:41.647
We need to rest up for a bit,
and we will move swiftly to Pennsa, okay?

33:41.730 --> 33:42.856
I am not staying here.

33:42.940 --> 33:44.942
You need a fresh bandage.

33:45.025 --> 33:48.153
Okay? I can smell it. Trust me.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.838
Make sure they find her in her house.
Nobody needs to know she's a part of this.

34:05.921 --> 34:06.922
Understood.

34:17.891 --> 34:19.476
You're not going with them?

34:20.518 --> 34:23.355
Nah. I figured you'd need the company.

34:25.858 --> 34:28.025
You know,
this likely won't end well for us.

34:29.820 --> 34:31.405
Tell me something I don't know.

35:47.523 --> 35:48.815
-Kofun!
-Stop!

35:56.448 --> 35:58.575
-We have to stop him.
-No.

35:59.618 --> 36:03.163
Kofun… this is our legacy.

36:03.247 --> 36:06.250
It's Jerlamarel's legacy. It's not ours.

36:06.333 --> 36:09.586
This is more than him. It's more than us.

36:09.670 --> 36:12.256
This place has destroyed the lives
of everyone we've loved!

36:13.340 --> 36:15.801
Okay? And these bombs might just be
the end of everything.

36:15.884 --> 36:17.928
You're not burning bombs! Are you?

36:18.804 --> 36:21.056
There are centuries of knowledge
in there, you--

36:21.139 --> 36:23.433
-I can't let him burn it. I won't let him.
-No.

36:27.437 --> 36:28.814
Stop!

36:30.649 --> 36:31.692
You can't stop him.

36:47.457 --> 36:48.458
Are you serious?

36:49.209 --> 36:52.713
This place is all that we have left.
It will keep us safe.

36:52.796 --> 36:54.256
Says the one holding a gun.

36:54.339 --> 36:56.258
I can't let you take this from me.

36:58.218 --> 36:59.469
Haniwa, it's me.

37:01.388 --> 37:02.389
Drop the gun.

37:05.475 --> 37:06.476
Please? Drop it.

37:09.688 --> 37:10.689
Are you serious?

37:10.772 --> 37:13.025
You're actually gonna try and shoot me?
Your own brother!

37:13.108 --> 37:15.110
What the hell? You're gonna shoot me?

37:17.487 --> 37:18.572
Come here!

37:19.323 --> 37:20.532
Get over--

37:23.243 --> 37:27.456
-You can't do this! Stop it!
-No!

37:30.250 --> 37:34.463
Stop! Now! It's over! Stop, it's done.

37:34.546 --> 37:37.716
Haniwa! Just stop it! Both of you!
We have to get out of here!

37:37.799 --> 37:39.968
-What did you do?
-Haniwa.

37:41.637 --> 37:44.389
Haniwa. I know. I'm sorry.

37:44.473 --> 37:47.726
We will die if we do not leave now.
I'm sorry.

39:02.926 --> 39:04.178
I miss our home.

39:05.512 --> 39:08.056
Take these children to safety
and then go there.

39:09.683 --> 39:11.643
I will make my way back to you.

39:13.395 --> 39:14.688
Don't become a Payan.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.233
I belong to no nation.

39:18.317 --> 39:20.068
You belong to me.

39:37.336 --> 39:38.462
Be strong, Haniwa.

39:43.300 --> 39:44.384
This place…

39:46.678 --> 39:48.388
with all of its knowledge,

39:51.725 --> 39:53.227
it was our way forward.

39:54.144 --> 39:57.773
If I know you, you'll find another way.

40:03.612 --> 40:04.738
But you'll come back?

40:06.281 --> 40:07.282
Missing me already?

40:08.909 --> 40:09.910
No.

40:12.079 --> 40:13.247
A little bit.

40:15.624 --> 40:16.625
I'll come back.

40:18.001 --> 40:21.338
Just do your best
to stay alive until I do. Okay?

40:22.256 --> 40:23.340
I will.

40:24.883 --> 40:25.884
Okay.

40:27.719 --> 40:28.929
Charlotte.

40:42.734 --> 40:44.903
Okay. Get out of here.

40:45.988 --> 40:48.156
Okay! Let's get going.

40:49.032 --> 40:53.829
Hayah, Hoveh, always behind me.
Sheva! Always behind them.

40:56.498 --> 40:57.499
Haniwa.

40:58.917 --> 41:00.627
Thank you for saving my family.

41:05.340 --> 41:07.009
Guess they were my family too.

41:08.135 --> 41:09.511
That means we're sisters.

41:16.059 --> 41:19.188
I'm sorry about your home.

41:24.067 --> 41:25.068
It's okay.

41:28.197 --> 41:29.239
There are others.
