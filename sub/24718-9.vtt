00:03.253 --> 00:06.214

00:06.256 --> 00:07.132
You know he likes you.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.717
-No.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.717
-He likes you.

00:08.759 --> 00:11.470
I look forward to every minute

00:08.759 --> 00:11.470
whenever I'm with you,

00:12.220 --> 00:14.431
so stick around, okay?

00:14.473 --> 00:16.391
I'm not going anywhere.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.770
Your English teacher

00:16.433 --> 00:19.770
was just telling me about

00:16.433 --> 00:19.770
the wonderful story you wrote.

00:19.812 --> 00:22.564
Apparently, you have

00:19.812 --> 00:22.564
quite the gift for prose.

00:22.606 --> 00:24.232
I got some options for dates.

00:24.274 --> 00:25.818
Sam, I can't wait

00:24.274 --> 00:25.818
to get married,

00:25.860 --> 00:29.070
but I don't know

00:25.860 --> 00:29.070
why we have to make

00:25.860 --> 00:29.070
all these decisions now.

00:31.323 --> 00:33.450
[soft music playing]

00:38.455 --> 00:41.041
There's a toy store

00:38.455 --> 00:41.041
at the end of the street

00:41.082 --> 00:44.085
and a place down there

00:41.082 --> 00:44.085
called Nothing but Yarn.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.045
And this is Cassie's shop.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.589
What does she sell here?

00:47.631 --> 00:48.757
Don't let the sign fool you.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.133
She's got lots of books

00:48.799 --> 00:50.133
and candles,

00:50.175 --> 00:52.135
but I hardly

00:50.175 --> 00:52.135
ever see any bells.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.179
[bells chiming]

00:54.221 --> 00:56.348
I sell a little bit

00:54.221 --> 00:56.348
of everything.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.766
Has your personal tour guide

00:56.390 --> 00:57.766
been showing you

00:57.808 --> 00:59.643
the best Middleton

00:57.808 --> 00:59.643
has to offer?

00:59.685 --> 01:01.729
Well, I've been showing him

00:59.685 --> 01:01.729
what Middleton has to offer,

01:01.770 --> 01:03.397
but there's not really

01:01.770 --> 01:03.397
a best of.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.940
-Oh, I've really been

01:03.438 --> 01:04.940
enjoying it, actually.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.940
-[Cassie] Mmm...

01:04.982 --> 01:06.984
-You have?

01:04.982 --> 01:06.984
-Well, yeah.

01:07.026 --> 01:09.695
I always hear about places

01:07.026 --> 01:09.695
with small town charm,

01:07.026 --> 01:09.695
but this town actually has it.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.238
Mmm, everywhere you look.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.412
And thank you so much

01:18.453 --> 01:19.830
for letting me extend

01:18.453 --> 01:19.830
my stay at Grey House.

01:19.872 --> 01:22.791
Oh, you can have the room

01:19.872 --> 01:22.791
as long as you want it.

01:22.833 --> 01:25.794
And if you want a memento,

01:25.836 --> 01:28.338
I had these made for anyone

01:25.836 --> 01:28.338
who wants to remember

01:25.836 --> 01:28.338
their stay.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.007
Oh...

01:30.049 --> 01:33.301
Well, I can see why someone

01:30.049 --> 01:33.301
would want to remember.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.803
I wonder what the Mayor wants.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.555
-Who?

01:34.845 --> 01:36.555
-Good morning!

01:36.597 --> 01:40.183
Cassie, I need your advice

01:36.597 --> 01:40.183
and perhaps even Abigail's.

01:36.597 --> 01:40.183
[chuckles]

01:40.225 --> 01:41.476
Oh, and you're Mr. Technology,

01:41.518 --> 01:43.395
so maybe you have

01:41.518 --> 01:43.395
an opinion, too.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.855
I was looking

01:43.437 --> 01:44.855
at our city's website,

01:44.897 --> 01:47.148
and I realized

01:44.897 --> 01:47.148
it is woefully out of date.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.401
-Oh, it's not that bad.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.401
-It's embarrassing!

01:49.443 --> 01:51.653
It still has a reference

01:49.443 --> 01:51.653
to how we won Cleanest Streets

01:51.695 --> 01:53.906
two years in a row,

01:51.695 --> 01:53.906
but that was ages ago!

01:53.948 --> 01:55.950
-We've actually won it five.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.950
-[both chuckles]

01:55.991 --> 01:58.243
Now, I need someone

01:55.991 --> 01:58.243
to rewrite the sections

01:58.285 --> 01:59.912
on our town's history.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.830
Mmm, well, you could ask Grace.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.331
-Oh!

02:01.872 --> 02:03.331
-That's a good idea.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.583
She proved how great

02:03.373 --> 02:04.583
a writer she is

02:04.625 --> 02:06.710
with those

02:04.625 --> 02:06.710
Elizabeth Merriwick stories.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.045
Who's Elizabeth Merriwick?

02:08.087 --> 02:09.713
Oh! Now you see,

02:09.755 --> 02:12.299
if our website

02:09.755 --> 02:12.299
was more current,

02:09.755 --> 02:12.299
he wouldn't even have to ask.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.717
I can tell Grace to stop by

02:13.759 --> 02:15.677
and talk to you about

02:13.759 --> 02:15.677
doing the job, if you'd like.

02:15.719 --> 02:16.678
I'd love.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.179
And now,

02:16.720 --> 02:18.179
if you'll all excuse me,

02:18.221 --> 02:19.556
I have to stop by Table Tops

02:19.598 --> 02:22.183
and get some new doilies

02:19.598 --> 02:22.183
for my dining room credenza.

02:23.518 --> 02:26.563
There is a store in Middleton

02:23.518 --> 02:26.563
that sells doilies?

02:26.605 --> 02:29.066
Yep. It's right next

02:26.605 --> 02:29.066
to Nothing but Yarn.

02:29.858 --> 02:30.734
What?

[soft music playing]

02:44.832 --> 02:46.000
Hey.

02:47.126 --> 02:49.168
Are we expecting

02:47.126 --> 02:49.168
any guests tomorrow?

02:49.210 --> 02:52.255
-Uh, not for a few days.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.255
-Good.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.967
I'm gonna take this opportunity

02:52.297 --> 02:54.967
to do nothing.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.468
I was gonna suggest

02:55.009 --> 02:56.468
you try that.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.846
-Goodnight.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.846
-Night.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.180
[inhales air deeply]

03:01.222 --> 03:03.767
-Hmm.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.767

03:08.313 --> 03:10.024
Hi, Sam.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.818

03:10.065 --> 03:12.818
<i>I should let you know</i>

03:10.065 --> 03:12.818
<i>I'm at the hospital.</i>

03:12.860 --> 03:14.319
Oh. I didn't know

03:12.860 --> 03:14.319
you were working tonight.

03:14.361 --> 03:17.364
<i>Yeah, that's not</i>

03:14.361 --> 03:17.364
<i>why I'm here.</i>

03:14.361 --> 03:17.364
[sighs]

03:17.405 --> 03:20.034
I had a little bit

03:17.405 --> 03:20.034
of an accident.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.494
Ow! Sorry. It's a little bit

03:20.075 --> 03:22.494
of a muscle strain.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.456
<i>And they've got me</i>

03:24.538 --> 03:26.456
<i>stuck in exam.</i>

03:27.749 --> 03:28.625
I'll be right there.

[tense music playing]

03:55.819 --> 03:57.988

03:55.819 --> 03:57.988
-Hi. Sam...

03:58.030 --> 04:00.949
-It's okay. I'm all right.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.949
-What happened?

04:00.991 --> 04:02.325
He was trying to help me.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.953
I saw a loose shingle

04:02.367 --> 04:04.953
on this guy's roof.

04:04.995 --> 04:05.954
And you know how Sam feels

04:05.996 --> 04:07.831
about things that

04:05.996 --> 04:07.831
are out of place.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.290
And I got up there

04:07.873 --> 04:09.290
and fixed it,

04:09.332 --> 04:11.793
and then I slipped

04:09.332 --> 04:11.793
on another one,

04:09.332 --> 04:11.793
on my way down.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.503
You fell off a roof.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.380
Right onto three

04:13.545 --> 04:15.380
baby pine trees

04:15.422 --> 04:16.631
that I had just planted.

04:16.673 --> 04:17.549
Oh, don't worry about me.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.967
What? You grow back.

04:19.009 --> 04:22.262
[sighs] It's no big deal,

04:19.009 --> 04:22.262
Cassie, really.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.805
So right when we're

04:22.303 --> 04:23.805
about to get married,

04:23.847 --> 04:27.142
you decide

04:23.847 --> 04:27.142
you just have to go

04:23.847 --> 04:27.142
crawling around on roofs?

04:27.184 --> 04:29.061
I just don't want you getting

04:27.184 --> 04:29.061
too banged up, that's all.

04:29.103 --> 04:32.064
[groans] Well, I'll try to keep

04:29.103 --> 04:32.064
my feet on the ground.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.946
[Grace]<i> My mom said</i>

04:36.902 --> 04:38.946
<i>that you wanted me</i>

04:36.902 --> 04:38.946
<i>to do some work on the website?</i>

04:38.987 --> 04:42.241
[Martha]<i> Oh, yes!</i>

04:38.987 --> 04:42.241
<i>And I think you're</i>

04:38.987 --> 04:42.241
<i>the perfect person for the job.</i>

04:42.282 --> 04:44.367
You love history

04:42.282 --> 04:44.367
and you love to write

04:44.409 --> 04:46.286
and this job involves both.

04:46.327 --> 04:49.123
Don't you have people

04:46.327 --> 04:49.123
who work here that take care

04:46.327 --> 04:49.123
of that kind of stuff?

04:49.164 --> 04:50.582
Well, there might be

04:49.164 --> 04:50.582
someone in IT,

04:50.624 --> 04:52.417
but I can never get them

04:50.624 --> 04:52.417
to stop playing 'Minecrafter'

04:52.459 --> 04:54.086
long enough to pay attention.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.421
Also, this isn't

04:54.128 --> 04:56.421
really in the budget.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.840
Hmm, I would be happy

04:56.463 --> 04:58.840
to volunteer.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.051
That's what I was

04:58.882 --> 05:01.051
hoping to hear!

05:02.427 --> 05:04.138
-Now, there is one...

05:02.427 --> 05:04.138
-Okay.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.265
...particular section

05:04.179 --> 05:06.265
of this website

05:06.306 --> 05:08.809
that always fills me

05:06.306 --> 05:08.809
with pride.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.145
It's about my own family,

05:08.850 --> 05:11.145
the Endicotts.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.980
Oh, I remember

05:11.186 --> 05:12.980
reading about them!

05:13.021 --> 05:16.024
Yes, well, Douglas Endicott

05:13.021 --> 05:16.024
was hailed as a hero

05:16.066 --> 05:18.318
for saving a family

05:16.066 --> 05:18.318
from a burning building,

05:18.359 --> 05:20.904
carrying each and every one

05:18.359 --> 05:20.904
of them to safety.

05:20.946 --> 05:22.781
They misspelled safety there.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.909
Oh. Well, now you see

05:22.823 --> 05:25.909
why we need your help.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.702
It was that act of bravery

05:27.744 --> 05:30.289
that established my family

05:27.744 --> 05:30.289
as being so prominent

05:30.330 --> 05:32.666
in the community, and it's

05:30.330 --> 05:32.666
why there's an Endicott Road

05:32.707 --> 05:35.002
that passes through some of the

05:32.707 --> 05:35.002
most desirable neighborhoods

05:35.043 --> 05:36.128
in Middleton.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.046
You must be very proud

05:36.170 --> 05:38.046
of your heritage.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.547
Oh, well, all the Endicotts

05:39.589 --> 05:41.300
were interesting

05:39.589 --> 05:41.300
in their own right.

05:41.340 --> 05:42.676
Douglas' wife Doris

05:42.717 --> 05:44.845
was a formidable lady

05:42.717 --> 05:44.845
who apparently used to play

05:44.886 --> 05:48.347
a mean game of seven-card stud,

05:48.389 --> 05:50.809
which also happens to be

05:48.389 --> 05:50.809
one of my own hidden passions,

05:50.851 --> 05:53.020
but don't tell anyone that

05:50.851 --> 05:53.020
your Mayor occasionally likes

05:53.061 --> 05:54.395
to hold out until

05:53.061 --> 05:54.395
the river to see

05:54.437 --> 05:56.190
if she hits her straight.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.190
[chuckles]

05:56.231 --> 05:58.399
-Your secret's safe.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.399
-Jared!

05:59.400 --> 06:00.986
Yes, Madam Mayor?

06:01.028 --> 06:03.404
I want you to give Grace

06:01.028 --> 06:03.404
unlimited access

06:01.028 --> 06:03.404
to the archives room,

06:03.446 --> 06:06.574
so she can research

06:03.446 --> 06:06.574
any history she needs

06:03.446 --> 06:06.574
to learn for the website.

06:06.616 --> 06:07.784
Yes, ma'am.

06:07.826 --> 06:08.952
[whispers] And also,

06:07.826 --> 06:08.952
she'll need the password

06:08.994 --> 06:10.537
into the city account,

06:10.578 --> 06:12.206
so she can go

06:10.578 --> 06:12.206
onto our computers.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.041
It's password.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.917
The city's password

06:14.082 --> 06:15.917
is "password"?

06:15.959 --> 06:17.127
Yeah, the Mayor wanted it

06:17.169 --> 06:18.628
to be something

06:17.169 --> 06:18.628
that was easy to remember.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.006
[chuckles]

06:21.048 --> 06:22.799
Mmm-hmm.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.551
Everybody says that

06:22.841 --> 06:24.551
here in the town square

06:24.592 --> 06:25.635
is where

06:24.592 --> 06:25.635
the most exciting things

06:25.677 --> 06:27.054
in Middleton happen.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.306
We have the Lights Festival

06:27.095 --> 06:29.306
in December,

06:29.348 --> 06:31.058
and we had a book release party

06:31.099 --> 06:34.019
for the third book in the

06:31.099 --> 06:34.019
Terrenceville series, too.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.394
<i>The Enchantress Unites.</i>

06:35.436 --> 06:36.813
You've read that?

06:36.855 --> 06:39.649
Well, my niece made me read

06:36.855 --> 06:39.649
her a couple of chapters

06:39.691 --> 06:41.776
and then I needed something

06:39.691 --> 06:41.776
to read on the plane.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.238
Oh, so it wasn't the romance

06:41.818 --> 06:44.238
that sucked you in.

06:44.279 --> 06:46.198
I just always have to know

06:44.279 --> 06:46.198
where a story's going.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.407
[chuckles]

06:49.159 --> 06:51.036
I really do love it here.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.329
Yeah, it's a place to live.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.624
What made you

06:54.248 --> 06:56.624
end up, uh, in Middleton?

06:56.666 --> 06:58.835
I just wanted

06:56.666 --> 06:58.835
to get away from New York.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.213
Oh. Was that

06:58.877 --> 07:01.213
after your friends

07:01.255 --> 07:03.131
who weren't really your friends

07:01.255 --> 07:03.131
stole your ad company

07:03.173 --> 07:04.632
out from under you?

07:04.674 --> 07:05.800
How do you know about that?

07:06.968 --> 07:09.096
I found some stuff online.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.181
I didn't realize there was

07:09.137 --> 07:11.181
anything about that on there.

07:11.223 --> 07:14.268
Yeah, I had to dig through

07:11.223 --> 07:14.268
a few filters, but...

07:14.309 --> 07:16.353
I can't imagine

07:14.309 --> 07:16.353
all the embarrassing stuff

07:16.395 --> 07:17.520
you probably found!

07:17.562 --> 07:18.855
[chuckles] No!

07:18.897 --> 07:20.648
What I found was a person

07:18.897 --> 07:20.648
who's honest and free

07:20.690 --> 07:23.568
and tells people

07:20.690 --> 07:23.568
exactly what she thinks...

07:23.610 --> 07:26.321
and has worn

07:23.610 --> 07:26.321
the same Christmas sweater

07:26.363 --> 07:27.281
for like, three years.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.489
[both laughs]

07:28.531 --> 07:30.617
Yeah, I need a new one.

07:30.658 --> 07:31.952
I thought it looked nice.

07:33.536 --> 07:37.165
I should probably admit

07:33.536 --> 07:37.165
I looked you up too.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.084
But the best thing about being

07:37.207 --> 07:39.084
a computer programmer

07:39.126 --> 07:41.253
is I know how to hide all

07:39.126 --> 07:41.253
the most embarrassing things.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.963
Oh. So when do I

07:41.295 --> 07:42.963
get to find out

07:43.004 --> 07:44.089
the stuff you don't

07:43.004 --> 07:44.089
want me to know?

07:45.548 --> 07:47.675
I guess you'll have to learn

07:45.548 --> 07:47.675
to get past my filter.

07:48.635 --> 07:49.677
I'll keep working on that.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.017
[Cassie]<i> How are you feeling?</i>

07:56.059 --> 07:59.062
Well, I'm still sore,

07:56.059 --> 07:59.062
but it's starting

07:56.059 --> 07:59.062
to get better.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.563
Okay.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.441
No, no. Uh, shouldn't you

08:00.605 --> 08:02.441
be off your feet?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.109
I know that's

08:02.482 --> 08:04.109
what a doctor would say.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.779
Doctors tend to be

08:04.151 --> 08:07.779
a little bit too cautious

08:04.151 --> 08:07.779
about these things.

08:07.821 --> 08:08.822
Well, some of them

08:07.821 --> 08:08.822
actually know

08:08.863 --> 08:09.948
what they're talking about.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.032
[laughter]

08:11.074 --> 08:12.367
-Hey, Nick.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.367
-Hey.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.286
The soup is mostly

08:12.409 --> 08:14.286
for your dad,

08:14.328 --> 08:15.912
but help yourself, too.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.580
-[Nick] Thanks.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.580
-How are those

08:15.954 --> 08:17.580
college applications coming?

08:17.622 --> 08:20.083
I haven't started

08:17.622 --> 08:20.083
filling them out yet.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.377
The deadline

08:20.125 --> 08:22.377
is three days from now.

08:22.419 --> 08:25.339
So, I still have

08:22.419 --> 08:25.339
three days then.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.091
All right, let's get you

08:25.380 --> 08:28.091
on the couch,

08:25.380 --> 08:28.091
get some rest.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.550
I brought you a heating pad.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.345
Oh, we've got one

08:29.592 --> 08:31.345
of those, but thanks.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.679
Yeah, but it's broken.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.764
It doesn't go past

08:32.720 --> 08:34.764
just barely warm.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.267
Well, I guess I can use it.

08:37.309 --> 08:38.977
Well, I'll be in my room.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.814
-Working on those college apps.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.814
-[stutters] Eventually.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.607
[Sam sighing]

08:44.649 --> 08:46.818
[groans] I can never

08:44.649 --> 08:46.818
find this outlet.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.362
Here, you want

08:46.860 --> 08:48.362
some more light?

08:49.988 --> 08:50.905
I got it.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.032
Here we go.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.826
All right. Can I get you

08:53.074 --> 08:54.826
anything else?

08:54.868 --> 08:57.537
I've got heat, I've got soup,

08:54.868 --> 08:57.537
everything a man can want.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.831
Yeah. Well then,

08:57.578 --> 08:59.831
my work is done.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.668
Hey, um...

09:03.710 --> 09:05.962
I was thinking about

09:03.710 --> 09:05.962
what you said at the hospital.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.339
What'd I say?

09:07.381 --> 09:09.799
Uh, it was about how,

09:07.381 --> 09:09.799
with our wedding coming up,

09:09.841 --> 09:13.470
maybe I shouldn't be

09:09.841 --> 09:13.470
climbing around

09:09.841 --> 09:13.470
on a friend's roof.

09:13.512 --> 09:15.555
Well, you know,

09:13.512 --> 09:15.555
I wanted our first dance

09:15.596 --> 09:17.265
to be an actual dance.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.934
[chuckles]

09:17.307 --> 09:19.934
That was the first time

09:17.307 --> 09:19.934
you've brought up the wedding

09:19.976 --> 09:22.062
in I don't know how long.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.232
Was it?

09:25.273 --> 09:26.316
Been a while, yeah.

09:28.276 --> 09:31.821
And all we've decided on is

09:28.276 --> 09:31.821
what song we want to be played.

09:31.863 --> 09:34.032
What about everything else?

09:31.863 --> 09:34.032
Have you walked past that place

09:34.074 --> 09:36.576
on the beach where you want

09:34.074 --> 09:36.576
the wedding to happen?

09:36.617 --> 09:38.161
Or seen that

09:36.617 --> 09:38.161
perfect color of flower

09:38.203 --> 09:39.620
you were hoping to find?

09:39.662 --> 09:41.415
Not really, no.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.126
You're not having

09:42.665 --> 09:45.126
second thoughts, are you?

09:45.168 --> 09:47.337
Sam, of course not.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.339
'Cause I'm good to go.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.840
I'm all set.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.345
So just let me know

09:53.301 --> 09:55.345
when you are. Okay?

09:59.766 --> 10:02.769
[soft music playing]

10:05.188 --> 10:06.731
[Grace] Where would

10:05.188 --> 10:06.731
the original photo be?

10:06.773 --> 10:10.485
[Jared] Somewhere in here.

10:06.773 --> 10:10.485
Uh, they're sorted by date.

10:10.527 --> 10:15.156
Grace] Oh. Well,

10:10.527 --> 10:15.156
the fire took place

10:10.527 --> 10:15.156
on April 12th, 1922.

10:15.198 --> 10:19.286
[Jared] 19... 22.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.828
It's the photo on the website.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.747
It's of Douglas Endicott

10:20.870 --> 10:22.747
receiving his award

10:22.789 --> 10:23.748
for saving that family.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.835
The one where he's getting

10:25.792 --> 10:27.835
the ribbon, sure.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.880
Let's see, let's see.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.880
April. Here we go.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.176
All right. [sighs]

10:35.218 --> 10:36.386
Thanks.

10:37.887 --> 10:38.972
Oh!

10:39.013 --> 10:40.390
Yeah, that's the one.

10:42.892 --> 10:43.810
Wait...

10:44.644 --> 10:46.187
the photo on the website

10:46.229 --> 10:48.189
cropped out everyone else

10:46.229 --> 10:48.189
who was there.

10:48.231 --> 10:51.401
-Hmm.

10:48.231 --> 10:51.401
-Hmm, he does look heroic.

10:51.443 --> 10:54.195
And his wife,

10:51.443 --> 10:54.195
she looks so proud.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.072
It looks like

10:54.237 --> 10:56.072
there are actually

10:54.237 --> 10:56.072
a few more of him

10:56.114 --> 10:57.449
from that same year.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.659
Oh, well, maybe I can use them

10:57.491 --> 10:59.659
on the website too.

10:59.700 --> 11:00.535
Yeah.

11:02.621 --> 11:03.830
What?

11:03.871 --> 11:06.541
-Is that Douglas Endicott?

11:03.871 --> 11:06.541
-It looks like it.

11:08.126 --> 11:11.421
"Opening day, Chicago, 1922."

11:11.463 --> 11:12.880
Can I take that?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.757
Yeah, take whatever you want.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.301
And if you ever need

11:14.799 --> 11:16.301
to get back in here,

11:16.343 --> 11:17.469
you just come on down.

11:17.511 --> 11:18.928
That door is always unlocked.

11:18.970 --> 11:22.432
Uh, shouldn't you keep

11:18.970 --> 11:22.432
stuff like this more secure?

11:22.474 --> 11:25.059
Well, yeah. We used to,

11:22.474 --> 11:25.059
but the Mayor kept

11:22.474 --> 11:25.059
losing her key,

11:25.101 --> 11:27.646
and I got a little tired

11:25.101 --> 11:27.646
of hearing--

11:25.101 --> 11:27.646
[imitates Martha] "Jared!"

11:27.686 --> 11:29.230
-So...

11:27.686 --> 11:29.230
-I understand.

11:29.772 --> 11:30.565
Mmm-hmm.

11:31.566 --> 11:34.319
Here you are.

11:31.566 --> 11:34.319
Have a nice day.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.070
So, where have they

11:34.361 --> 11:36.070
set up camp?

11:36.904 --> 11:39.324
Are there serious injuries?

11:39.366 --> 11:42.202
Um... yeah, let me see

11:39.366 --> 11:42.202
if I can get there.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.870
I'll let you know.

11:43.911 --> 11:45.413
Eve, will you get in touch

11:43.911 --> 11:45.413
with Dr. Legett

11:45.455 --> 11:47.040
and see if he can cover me

11:45.455 --> 11:47.040
for the next few days?

11:47.081 --> 11:49.292
-Is everything okay?

11:47.081 --> 11:49.292
-Yeah, not really.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.878
You know I did some work

11:49.334 --> 11:51.878
with that aid organization

11:49.334 --> 11:51.878
last summer?

11:51.919 --> 11:53.505
In South America.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.881
Right. They've had a series of

11:53.547 --> 11:54.881
storms near one of the villages

11:54.922 --> 11:56.341
I visited before.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.176
And they really need

11:56.383 --> 11:58.176
medical personnel down there

11:58.218 --> 11:59.636
to help with

11:58.218 --> 11:59.636
the evacuation sites.

12:00.554 --> 12:01.720
When do they need you?

12:01.762 --> 12:03.014
As soon as possible.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.432
I'm gonna see

12:03.056 --> 12:04.432
how quickly I can get a flight.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.017
I'll get in touch

12:04.474 --> 12:06.017
with Dr. Legett.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.644
[Sam] And I need

12:06.059 --> 12:07.644
to tell Cassie I'm going.

12:08.769 --> 12:11.772
[soft music playing]

12:17.529 --> 12:19.447
-Hello, Eve!

12:17.529 --> 12:19.447
-Hello!

12:22.325 --> 12:23.451
[sighs]

12:23.493 --> 12:25.912
Do you think

12:23.493 --> 12:25.912
that Sam would like this?

12:25.953 --> 12:27.622
He would.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.666
I am putting together

12:27.664 --> 12:29.666
a few things for him

12:27.664 --> 12:29.666
to take to Columbia.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.167
Also, I got him this.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.752
It's a pen light.

12:33.794 --> 12:36.130
-What can I help you find?

12:33.794 --> 12:36.130
-A wedding gift.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.675
Not for you.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.675
It's for my friend Karen.

12:38.717 --> 12:42.262
Although, I am eager to know

12:38.717 --> 12:42.262
when you and Dr. Radford

12:38.717 --> 12:42.262
are going to set a date.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.931
We'll be setting

12:42.303 --> 12:44.931
a date very soon.

12:45.515 --> 12:46.807
[chuckles]

12:46.849 --> 12:49.185
Are you worried

12:46.849 --> 12:49.185
about Dr. Radford being gone?

12:49.227 --> 12:51.688
Oh, no. He's been there before.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.688
I'm sure he'll be fine.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.690
It's just with

12:51.730 --> 12:53.690
the storms going on...

12:54.773 --> 12:55.942
Storms?

12:55.983 --> 12:57.776
That's why he needs

12:55.983 --> 12:57.776
to get there so quickly.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.447
Oh. He didn't mention

12:58.819 --> 13:00.447
that to me.

13:00.488 --> 13:01.948
He just said he was going.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.783
Oh. Well, I'm sure it's nothing

13:01.989 --> 13:04.783
to be too concerned about.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.953
Yeah, probably.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.916
-Mayor Tinsdale?

13:09.414 --> 13:11.916
-Oh, Grace! Hello.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.543
I need to talk to you

13:11.958 --> 13:13.543
about the website.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.253
Oh, then I'm glad

13:13.585 --> 13:15.253
you caught me.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.756
Have you found a way

13:15.295 --> 13:17.756
to feature my family

13:15.295 --> 13:17.756
even more prominently?

13:17.796 --> 13:19.633
I found something.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.384
I found this photo

13:19.674 --> 13:21.384
of Douglas Endicott

13:21.426 --> 13:22.885
in the archives

13:21.426 --> 13:22.885
getting his award.

13:22.927 --> 13:23.970
[Martha] Oh!

13:24.011 --> 13:26.055
And this one of him

13:24.011 --> 13:26.055
at a Cubs game.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.682
My great-grandfather

13:26.097 --> 13:27.682
was a Cubs fan,

13:27.724 --> 13:29.601
so I guess

13:27.724 --> 13:29.601
it runs in the family.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.185
That was on opening day,

13:31.227 --> 13:33.396
April 12, 1922.

13:33.438 --> 13:34.314
So?

13:34.355 --> 13:35.774
So that was the same day

13:35.814 --> 13:37.442
that he was supposed

13:35.814 --> 13:37.442
to have been saving that family

13:37.484 --> 13:38.610
from the burning building.

13:38.652 --> 13:39.860
Well...

13:39.902 --> 13:41.529
that's impossible!

13:41.571 --> 13:44.449
How could he have been

13:41.571 --> 13:44.449
in Middleton and Chicago

13:41.571 --> 13:44.449
at the same time?

13:44.491 --> 13:45.992
He couldn't have been,

13:46.033 --> 13:48.035
and he definitely wasn't here.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.330
That photo proves it.

13:50.371 --> 13:53.625
Well, then that would mean

13:50.371 --> 13:53.625
that the legend isn't true.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.252
There's no way it could be.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.880
Then my family name is a...

14:00.381 --> 14:01.508
a fraud.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.513
Oh...

14:08.264 --> 14:10.224
[Cassie] Why didn't you tell me

14:08.264 --> 14:10.224
about the storms?

14:10.266 --> 14:11.184
[Sam] Didn't I?

14:11.225 --> 14:13.019
[stutters]

14:11.225 --> 14:13.019
I didn't mean not to.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.937
I guess I was just thinking

14:13.060 --> 14:14.937
about everything I had to do

14:14.979 --> 14:17.398
about my flights and make sure

14:14.979 --> 14:17.398
all my patients were covered.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.859
Right. And when are you

14:17.440 --> 14:19.859
getting there?

14:19.900 --> 14:21.944
Well, if I can make

14:19.900 --> 14:21.944
the connection in Bogota,

14:21.986 --> 14:25.323
I should get to

14:21.986 --> 14:25.323
the evacuation center

14:21.986 --> 14:25.323
not too late in the morning.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.742
I'll be back in a few days.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.369
I got you a couple

14:27.784 --> 14:29.369
of things before you go.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.791
-Ah.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.791
-[Cassie chuckles]

14:34.833 --> 14:36.959
To keep you warm

14:34.833 --> 14:36.959
if the winds get too strong.

14:38.461 --> 14:39.879
I love it.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.923
And in case you need

14:39.920 --> 14:42.923
to plug something

14:39.920 --> 14:42.923
in the dark...

14:43.675 --> 14:45.301
-It's a pen light.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.301
-Ah!

14:46.553 --> 14:47.970
Thanks.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.764
You sure you don't want me

14:48.012 --> 14:49.764
to take you to the airport?

14:49.806 --> 14:52.266
Nick said he wanted to,

14:49.806 --> 14:52.266
and he promised

14:52.308 --> 14:54.394
he's gonna work

14:52.308 --> 14:54.394
on those college applications

14:52.308 --> 14:54.394
while I'm gone.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.771
Okay. Well, I'll make sure

14:54.435 --> 14:56.771
he gets done what he needs to.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.735
-Call me when you get there.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.735
-Yeah, I'll try.

15:01.776 --> 15:04.278
That cell service

15:01.776 --> 15:04.278
is really spotty

15:01.776 --> 15:04.278
in the mountains.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.697
Okay. Just know

15:04.320 --> 15:05.697
I'm thinking of you.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.408
I'm thinking about you too.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.160
I love you.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.830
Yeah. I love you.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.624
[soft music playing]

15:23.130 --> 15:23.964
I have to...

15:24.591 --> 15:26.593
-Yeah. Go.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.593
-Okay.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.514
[Latin-themed music playing]

15:35.226 --> 15:37.144
[indistinct chatter]

15:51.409 --> 15:53.202
-Dr. Radford.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.202
-Yeah.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.121
Shannon Calderon,

15:53.244 --> 15:55.121
physician in charge.

15:55.162 --> 15:58.165
-Ah, nice to meet you.

15:55.162 --> 15:58.165
-Thank you so much

15:55.162 --> 15:58.165
for coming here so quickly.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.209
Oh, sure. No problem.

16:00.251 --> 16:01.586
-How's it going inside?

16:00.251 --> 16:01.586
-It's all right.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.963
We got about a couple hundred

16:01.628 --> 16:03.963
people in here.

16:04.004 --> 16:06.006
Some of them are injured and

16:04.004 --> 16:06.006
they're in the medical tent,

16:06.048 --> 16:07.508
which is where we're

16:06.048 --> 16:07.508
gonna need you, of course.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.010
All right. Is this wind

16:07.550 --> 16:10.010
supposed to get any worse?

16:10.052 --> 16:11.220
Well, I hope not.

16:11.262 --> 16:12.221
[Sam chuckles]

16:14.265 --> 16:15.224
Do you speak Spanish?

16:15.266 --> 16:16.851
[in Spanish]

16:15.266 --> 16:16.851
Ah,<i> un poco.</i>

16:16.893 --> 16:18.853
Well, you should

16:16.893 --> 16:18.853
be able to get by.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.564
Here. Uh, so, we have

16:18.895 --> 16:21.564
plenty of food,

16:21.606 --> 16:23.149
but not very much

16:21.606 --> 16:23.149
drinking water.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.066
Thanks.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.025
And, uh...

16:26.402 --> 16:28.237
our generator

16:26.402 --> 16:28.237
is just strong enough

16:28.279 --> 16:31.073
to barely keep the lights on.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.408
This is your

16:31.115 --> 16:32.408
first patient here.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.786
This gentleman fractured

16:32.450 --> 16:34.786
his wrist

16:34.828 --> 16:37.330
when he was trying to get

16:34.828 --> 16:37.330
his car out of the mud.

16:37.371 --> 16:40.082
[speaking Spanish]

16:40.124 --> 16:41.584
If you need anything,

16:40.124 --> 16:41.584
I'm in that tent there.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.085
-Okay. Thank you. Sure.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.085
-Good luck.

16:47.047 --> 16:50.050
[soft music playing]

16:55.181 --> 16:56.140
Ah...

17:08.653 --> 17:09.779
[in Spanish]<i> Hola.</i>

17:09.821 --> 17:10.905
I'm a doctor.

17:10.947 --> 17:12.532
<i>Soy medico.</i>

17:20.665 --> 17:22.667
Thanks for letting me

17:20.665 --> 17:22.667
come over for breakfast.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.627
You are welcome here

17:22.709 --> 17:24.627
any time your dad is gone,

17:24.669 --> 17:26.587
and even when he's here.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.587
[chuckles]

17:27.463 --> 17:29.215
Where are you headed off to?

17:29.256 --> 17:31.509
Phil wanted me to show him

17:29.256 --> 17:31.509
more of Middleton.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.845
You sure all those tours

17:31.551 --> 17:33.845
aren't just an excuse

17:33.887 --> 17:35.304
for him to be with you?

17:35.346 --> 17:36.472
Of course they are.

17:36.514 --> 17:37.807
Why do you think

17:36.514 --> 17:37.807
I keep saying yes?

17:37.849 --> 17:38.725
[chuckles]

17:38.766 --> 17:40.894
Taken him to the old mill yet?

17:40.935 --> 17:42.645
I hadn't thought of that.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.314
It's such a part

17:42.687 --> 17:45.314
of Middleton's history,

17:45.356 --> 17:47.608
and I'm pretty sure

17:45.356 --> 17:47.608
it snowed out there

17:45.356 --> 17:47.608
last night,

17:47.650 --> 17:50.611
so you might wanna see

17:47.650 --> 17:50.611
how beautiful things look.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.238
-That's a good idea.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.238
-Mmm-hmm.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.450
-[Grace and Abigail] Morning!

17:54.407 --> 17:56.450
-Hello.

17:56.492 --> 18:00.621
-Hey. Oh, did I miss breakfast?

17:56.492 --> 18:00.621
-Oh, you can grab anything

17:56.492 --> 18:00.621
before Nick puts it away.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.498
-Help yourself.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.498
-Thanks.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.420
So, have you made any progress

18:04.166 --> 18:07.420
on the website for the Mayor?

18:07.461 --> 18:10.172
I made some progress,

18:07.461 --> 18:10.172
but not the kind she likes.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.591
Oh.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.426
I found out that

18:11.632 --> 18:13.426
Mayor Tinsdale's

18:11.632 --> 18:13.426
great-grandfather

18:13.467 --> 18:16.136
didn't save the family

18:13.467 --> 18:16.136
like everyone thought he did,

18:16.178 --> 18:18.514
because he wasn't even there

18:16.178 --> 18:18.514
when it happened.

18:18.556 --> 18:19.891
Hmm.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.852
At the corner of Endicott Road

18:19.933 --> 18:22.852
and Shanaman Avenue.

18:22.894 --> 18:24.687
Where's that?

18:24.729 --> 18:26.856
Well, there's a park there now,

18:24.729 --> 18:26.856
but it's where the hotel

18:24.729 --> 18:26.856
used to be.

18:26.898 --> 18:29.859
They named the streets

18:26.898 --> 18:29.859
after Douglas Endicott and...

18:29.901 --> 18:31.652
somebody Shanaman.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.154
I can show you

18:31.694 --> 18:34.154
where it was, if...

18:36.156 --> 18:38.618
Oh, yeah. I thought I still

18:36.156 --> 18:38.618
had one of those in here.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.537
What am I supposed

18:39.911 --> 18:41.537
to do with this?

18:41.579 --> 18:42.622
It's a map.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.916
You use it to find

18:42.663 --> 18:44.916
your way to places.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.709
I thought that's what

18:44.958 --> 18:46.709
phones were for.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.921
Yeah, except this one folds,

18:46.751 --> 18:49.921
and you can put it

18:46.751 --> 18:49.921
in your glove box.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.756
Then how come there are never

18:49.963 --> 18:51.756
any gloves in there?

18:51.798 --> 18:53.299
[chuckles]

18:51.798 --> 18:53.299
Will you just take it?

18:53.340 --> 18:54.675
See where it leads you.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.219
Do you need help

18:55.760 --> 18:57.219
with the dishes?

18:57.261 --> 18:58.930
Already taken care of.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.474
Huh.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.392
-Wish me luck.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.392
-Okay. [sighs]

19:04.978 --> 19:06.062
Any word from Dad?

19:06.104 --> 19:07.772
Uh, not yet.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.649
Well, I'm sure he'll call

19:07.814 --> 19:09.649
when he can.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.567
Yeah.

19:15.113 --> 19:18.908
So, you had a chance to work

19:15.113 --> 19:18.908
on those college applications?

19:18.950 --> 19:20.200
Well, I really want to,

19:20.242 --> 19:22.411
but we have

19:20.242 --> 19:22.411
all these dishes, so...

19:22.453 --> 19:23.997
Uh-huh.

19:24.038 --> 19:27.125
Plus, I'm not sure

19:24.038 --> 19:27.125
where I should apply.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.793
All my friends

19:27.166 --> 19:28.793
seem to be excited

19:28.835 --> 19:30.586
about where they're gonna be,

19:30.628 --> 19:32.588
but I have no idea.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.841
I haven't even figured out

19:32.630 --> 19:34.841
what I wanna do.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.802
We need to get him in a sling,

27:58.844 --> 27:59.928
and I just used the last one.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.641
Ah! I have that scarf

28:01.096 --> 28:03.641
Cassie gave me.

28:08.061 --> 28:11.482
Okay. Tell your father...

28:11.524 --> 28:13.150
he's gonna need to stay

28:11.524 --> 28:13.150
in this for a few days.

28:13.192 --> 28:16.445
Okay? Here you go.

28:13.192 --> 28:16.445
Put your arm through here.

28:16.487 --> 28:18.238
<i>Si.</i>

28:18.280 --> 28:20.366
And tell him he needs

28:18.280 --> 28:20.366
to let you know

28:18.280 --> 28:20.366
when he's not feeling well.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.535
Let the people that care about

28:20.407 --> 28:22.535
you care about you.

28:23.661 --> 28:25.871
-<i> Gracias,</i> doctor.

28:23.661 --> 28:25.871
-Thank you.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.543
-Uh, Doctor Radford?

28:28.832 --> 28:30.543
-Yeah?

28:30.584 --> 28:32.919
We got trucks moving in here.

28:30.584 --> 28:32.919
We've been ordered to evacuate.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.046
All right. So what's wrong?

28:34.087 --> 28:35.464
The storm has changed course

28:35.506 --> 28:37.132
and it's threatening our site,

28:37.174 --> 28:39.510
so we need to move

28:37.174 --> 28:39.510
to a safer location

28:37.174 --> 28:39.510
about 80 miles from here.

28:39.552 --> 28:41.303
-Okay?

28:39.552 --> 28:41.303
-Okay.

28:41.345 --> 28:44.764
-<i> Por favor, atencion!</i>

28:41.345 --> 28:44.764
-Okay. No rush.

28:44.806 --> 28:47.226
No rush. Can you walk? Okay.

28:51.271 --> 28:52.565
[Grace] I went

28:51.271 --> 28:52.565
to where it happened,

28:52.606 --> 28:55.192
and I just...

28:52.606 --> 28:55.192
I had this feeling

28:55.234 --> 28:58.153
that maybe something else

28:55.234 --> 28:58.153
was going on there.

29:00.447 --> 29:01.657
Wait, what's all that?

29:02.533 --> 29:04.368
Oh, I don't know.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.871
I keep on thinking

29:04.410 --> 29:07.871
I'll have time to catalog

29:04.410 --> 29:07.871
all this stuff, but frankly,

29:07.913 --> 29:09.831
I'd need an assistant

29:07.913 --> 29:09.831
of my own to do that.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.626
[sighing]

29:14.920 --> 29:15.837
What's in this?

29:18.674 --> 29:21.343
Oh. "Items recovered

29:18.674 --> 29:21.343
from Richard Shanaman's

29:21.385 --> 29:22.636
illegal poker game."

29:23.596 --> 29:25.097
Richard Shanaman?

29:25.138 --> 29:27.349
They named a street after him,

29:25.138 --> 29:27.349
but then they changed it.

29:27.391 --> 29:28.850
Why would they do that?

29:28.892 --> 29:32.187
Because he was running

29:28.892 --> 29:32.187
an illegal poker game?

29:32.229 --> 29:34.189
Does it say on there

29:32.229 --> 29:34.189
when all this was recovered?

29:34.231 --> 29:37.776
Uh... "April 12, 1922."

29:39.570 --> 29:40.696
The hotel fire.

29:50.539 --> 29:51.707
Well, this is weird.

29:53.083 --> 29:53.917
Why?

29:55.043 --> 29:56.420
In those days,

29:56.462 --> 29:57.879
poker was a man's game.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.256
Any woman who would

29:57.921 --> 29:59.256
have been there

29:59.298 --> 30:02.551
would've been looked at

29:59.298 --> 30:02.551
as being... of ill repute.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.053
There's something in here.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.098
What does it say?

30:10.934 --> 30:12.311
Who the purse belonged to.

30:15.814 --> 30:16.940
And now I understand

30:16.982 --> 30:18.776
why she couldn't

30:16.982 --> 30:18.776
say she was there.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.653
[soft music playing]

30:27.159 --> 30:30.120
-[Hannah] Who is it?

30:27.159 --> 30:30.120
-Uh, delivery from The Bistro.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.831
Oh! Thank you.

30:32.872 --> 30:36.209
I'm sorry, I just can't

30:32.872 --> 30:36.209
see anything out here.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.754
You know, that light's

30:36.251 --> 30:38.754
been out for a week.

30:38.796 --> 30:40.339
I tried getting up

30:38.796 --> 30:40.339
on the ladder,

30:40.380 --> 30:42.924
but it's too wobbly for me.

30:42.966 --> 30:45.511
Uh, I can do that

30:42.966 --> 30:45.511
if you have a light bulb.

30:45.552 --> 30:46.679
I have one right here.

30:50.641 --> 30:51.600
Here you go.

30:52.851 --> 30:53.686
Thanks.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.108
So, how many delivery guys

31:00.150 --> 31:02.277
does it take

31:00.150 --> 31:02.277
to change a lightbulb?

31:02.861 --> 31:03.862
[Nick grunts]

31:05.656 --> 31:06.573
One.

31:06.615 --> 31:08.408
[both laughing]

31:08.450 --> 31:10.703
One very helpful one.

31:12.287 --> 31:15.165
Oh, thank you so much!

31:15.207 --> 31:17.125
Now, what do I owe you?

31:17.167 --> 31:19.961
Oh, maintenance is free

31:17.167 --> 31:19.961
with every delivery.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.630
Well, now, here. You...

31:23.215 --> 31:26.259
You have one of these.

31:23.215 --> 31:26.259
I just made the batch.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.387
Thank you.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.013
I was about to take them down

31:28.428 --> 31:30.013
to the homeless shelter,

31:30.055 --> 31:31.724
but I can always make

31:30.055 --> 31:31.724
some more.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.311
Well, you know,

31:33.600 --> 31:36.311
I've never asked you your name.

31:36.353 --> 31:38.980
-Nick Radford.

31:36.353 --> 31:38.980
-Like Dr. Radford?

31:39.022 --> 31:40.733
Yeah. That's my dad.

31:40.774 --> 31:42.651
Oh, and are you gonna be

31:40.774 --> 31:42.651
just like him?

31:42.693 --> 31:43.736
Are you going to be a doctor?

31:44.986 --> 31:45.821
Uh...

31:47.113 --> 31:48.824
I don't know what I wanna do.

31:49.491 --> 31:52.035
[phone ringing]

31:54.788 --> 31:57.207
[long beep]

32:05.549 --> 32:07.133
Any news about Sam?

32:07.967 --> 32:08.968
No.

32:10.387 --> 32:12.598
I just wanna know

32:10.387 --> 32:12.598
that he's okay.

32:13.891 --> 32:16.351
Oh, you usually have

32:16.393 --> 32:18.812
a good sense of how things

32:16.393 --> 32:18.812
are gonna turn out.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.564
Yeah, most of the time, but...

32:22.816 --> 32:24.443
I'm sure he's

32:22.816 --> 32:24.443
gonna be all right.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.571
[sighing]

32:25.694 --> 32:27.571
You know, I want...

32:27.613 --> 32:30.323
I wanted Sam to be safe,

32:27.613 --> 32:30.323
so I even put sort of a

32:30.365 --> 32:32.325
[chuckles] good luck charm

32:30.365 --> 32:32.325
in his pocket.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.704
Sam doesn't really

32:33.660 --> 32:35.704
believe in luck.

32:35.746 --> 32:37.414
That's why I didn't

32:35.746 --> 32:37.414
tell him I did it.

32:38.832 --> 32:40.959
I understand why you're

32:38.832 --> 32:40.959
trying to protect him.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.879
You're looking

32:42.085 --> 32:43.879
at a lifetime together

32:43.921 --> 32:46.465
and you wanna make sure

32:43.921 --> 32:46.465
you do everything

32:46.506 --> 32:49.468
you can to make sure

32:46.506 --> 32:49.468
you don't lose him.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.762
Well, Sam and I are in love.

32:49.509 --> 32:51.762
That's forever.

32:52.930 --> 32:54.640
Oh, no. I don't

32:52.930 --> 32:54.640
mean it like that.

32:54.681 --> 32:57.768
I mean... really lose him.

33:00.186 --> 33:01.104
Yeah.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.731
I shouldn't be

33:01.146 --> 33:02.731
feeling that way.

33:03.273 --> 33:05.984
But you are,

33:06.025 --> 33:08.361
because the last time

33:06.025 --> 33:08.361
you said the words

33:09.571 --> 33:11.156
'til death do us part,

33:13.158 --> 33:14.827
it happened a lot sooner

33:13.158 --> 33:14.827
than any of us

33:14.868 --> 33:15.869
thought it would.

33:18.037 --> 33:19.247
So you...

33:19.289 --> 33:21.374
You can't help but think

33:19.289 --> 33:21.374
it might happen again.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.461
I keep falling in love

33:24.503 --> 33:26.463
with men who wanna

33:24.503 --> 33:26.463
change the world.

33:28.298 --> 33:29.842
Why do they have to take

33:28.298 --> 33:29.842
so many risks

33:29.883 --> 33:31.134
while they're doing it?

33:32.552 --> 33:33.971
Because if they didn't...

33:34.847 --> 33:36.723
the world would never change.

33:39.810 --> 33:40.853
[sighing]

33:45.565 --> 33:47.275
[indistinct chatter]

33:49.110 --> 33:50.654
Okay. Just lie here. Okay?

33:49.110 --> 33:50.654
You'll be fine.

33:50.696 --> 33:51.613
You okay?

33:54.950 --> 33:56.827
-How are you doing?

33:54.950 --> 33:56.827
-Hey. How many people

33:54.950 --> 33:56.827
are left inside?

33:56.869 --> 33:58.119
I think there's just a few.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.121
Okay. We need to get them all

33:58.161 --> 34:00.121
in the truck now.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.878
Rosa! Your family

34:03.166 --> 34:05.878
has to get on the truck.

34:05.919 --> 34:07.337
My mom says she needs help.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.506
She's been

34:07.379 --> 34:09.506
getting weaker all day.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.257
How long has it been

34:09.548 --> 34:11.257
since she had anything

34:09.548 --> 34:11.257
to drink?

34:12.091 --> 34:13.719
Uh, not since we got here.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.512
They said they were running

34:13.760 --> 34:15.512
low on supplies

34:13.760 --> 34:15.512
and she was giving

34:15.554 --> 34:16.429
all of it to the baby.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.639
She's dehydrated.

34:17.681 --> 34:20.893
-Help me get her up.

34:17.681 --> 34:20.893
-Okay. Mama. Mama. Mama.

34:20.934 --> 34:22.728
Sit up. There you go.

34:26.773 --> 34:27.691
-Okay.

34:26.773 --> 34:27.691
-Good.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.735
All right. Okay. Come on.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.778
[indistinct chatter]

34:33.697 --> 34:36.408
Okay. Tell your mother

34:33.697 --> 34:36.408
I can help her once

34:33.697 --> 34:36.408
we get on the truck, okay?

34:36.449 --> 34:38.535
[speaking Spanish]

34:38.577 --> 34:40.537
You good? Hey,

34:38.577 --> 34:40.537
is everything okay here?

34:40.579 --> 34:42.247
Uh, yeah. I need saline bags.

34:42.288 --> 34:43.874
-I got some more in the truck.

34:42.288 --> 34:43.874
-Just one.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.709
-I'm on it.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.709
-Yeah.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.628
-Here you go. I can help.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.628
-<i> Gracias.</i>

34:48.670 --> 34:50.505
I got her. I got her.

Okay, Isabelle.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.928
-Here you go!

34:55.969 --> 34:57.429
Okay. Thanks.

35:02.141 --> 35:03.518
All right.

35:03.560 --> 35:04.937
I can get this started

35:03.560 --> 35:04.937
once we get moving, all right?

35:04.978 --> 35:06.312
I just need

35:04.978 --> 35:06.312
somewhere to hang this.

35:10.609 --> 35:11.818
This'll work.

35:11.860 --> 35:14.029
[baby crying]

35:17.282 --> 35:19.451
All right. Just put this

35:17.282 --> 35:19.451
around your neck. Okay?

35:20.660 --> 35:22.370
There you go.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.081
Once I get this drip started,

35:22.412 --> 35:24.081
tell your mother

35:24.122 --> 35:25.999
she has to keep her arm

35:24.122 --> 35:25.999
below the bag to get the fluid

35:26.041 --> 35:27.292
in her system. Okay?

35:27.333 --> 35:30.545
[speaking Spanish]

35:30.587 --> 35:32.005
Okay.

35:32.047 --> 35:33.423
Isabelle wants

35:32.047 --> 35:33.423
to sit with you.

35:33.757 --> 35:35.216
Oh.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.886
Okay.

35:37.928 --> 35:41.139
All right, Isabelle.

35:37.928 --> 35:41.139
It's gonna be fine.

35:41.180 --> 35:42.849
We're just going

35:41.180 --> 35:42.849
for a little ride.

35:42.891 --> 35:45.894
[tense music playing]

35:53.986 --> 35:56.989
[soft music playing]

36:04.121 --> 36:07.457
-Madam Mayor?

36:04.121 --> 36:07.457
-Oh, Grace. Come on in.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.876
I found something out

36:07.499 --> 36:09.876
about your ancestors.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.753
Well, I hope you're not gonna

36:09.918 --> 36:11.753
put it on the website.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.672
I'm embarrassed enough

36:11.795 --> 36:13.672
as it is.

36:13.713 --> 36:16.299
No. This is good.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.425
I showed you this photo before

36:17.467 --> 36:19.094
of Douglas getting his award.

36:19.136 --> 36:20.971
The one he didn't deserve.

36:21.013 --> 36:23.932
But look what Mrs. Endicott

36:21.013 --> 36:23.932
was holding.

36:23.974 --> 36:27.226
Those two children, the ones

36:23.974 --> 36:27.226
who were carried out

36:23.974 --> 36:27.226
of the building.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.937
Well, I did mention

36:27.268 --> 36:28.937
she was formidable.

36:28.979 --> 36:31.356
And she was a poker player.

36:31.397 --> 36:33.483
And do you know

36:31.397 --> 36:33.483
what was going on

36:31.397 --> 36:33.483
in the basement

36:33.525 --> 36:35.568
of the building

36:33.525 --> 36:35.568
the night of the fire?

36:35.610 --> 36:37.403
A poker game.

36:37.445 --> 36:40.198
Jared and I found

36:37.445 --> 36:40.198
a box of items that were

36:37.445 --> 36:40.198
recovered after the fact,

36:40.239 --> 36:42.784
and... this was in there.

36:42.826 --> 36:44.577
A lady's purse.

36:44.619 --> 36:45.996
And any woman

36:44.619 --> 36:45.996
who would've been caught there

36:46.038 --> 36:47.455
would've been too embarrassed

36:46.038 --> 36:47.455
to admit it.

36:47.497 --> 36:48.832
Well, yes.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.959
That was during prohibition,

36:48.874 --> 36:50.959
so any such activities

36:51.001 --> 36:53.211
would have been

36:51.001 --> 36:53.211
frowned upon by everyone.

36:53.252 --> 36:55.172
Which is why

36:53.252 --> 36:55.172
Doris couldn't admit

36:55.213 --> 36:58.675
that she was the one

36:55.213 --> 36:58.675
who saved the family,

36:55.213 --> 36:58.675
but she left her purse there

36:58.717 --> 36:59.759
while doing it.

36:59.801 --> 37:01.344
But how do we know

36:59.801 --> 37:01.344
this was hers?

37:01.386 --> 37:03.304
Because I found

37:01.386 --> 37:03.304
something inside.

37:06.975 --> 37:09.477
"To Doris, love Douglas."

37:09.519 --> 37:11.479
They had to come up

37:09.519 --> 37:11.479
with a different story

37:11.521 --> 37:13.857
in order to protect

37:11.521 --> 37:13.857
the family name,

37:13.899 --> 37:15.692
and Doris was

37:13.899 --> 37:15.692
smart enough to say

37:15.734 --> 37:17.527
that it was Douglas

37:15.734 --> 37:17.527
who was there.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.113
So an Endicott

37:17.569 --> 37:20.113
did save the day!

37:20.155 --> 37:22.323
Just not the Endicott

37:20.155 --> 37:22.323
people thought.

37:22.365 --> 37:24.743
So that means

37:22.365 --> 37:24.743
that the street sign

37:22.365 --> 37:24.743
for Endicott Road

37:24.784 --> 37:26.452
can remain exactly where it is.

37:26.494 --> 37:29.539
I think it should,

37:26.494 --> 37:29.539
to honor your family name.

37:29.581 --> 37:33.543
Well, you know,

37:29.581 --> 37:33.543
we are very highly esteemed.

37:29.581 --> 37:33.543
[chuckles]

37:36.462 --> 37:37.964
Thank you for thinking of me.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.175
Oh, I know how much

37:38.006 --> 37:40.175
you like lavender candles,

37:40.217 --> 37:42.802
and I wanted you

37:40.217 --> 37:42.802
to be the first to know

37:40.217 --> 37:42.802
when they got here.

37:42.844 --> 37:45.138
-Come back any time.

37:42.844 --> 37:45.138
-You know I will.

37:51.228 --> 37:52.896
I am, yeah. Everything's fine.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.647
We had to move to

37:52.938 --> 37:54.647
a new location,

37:54.689 --> 37:55.857
but they had

37:54.689 --> 37:55.857
a phone I could use.

37:55.899 --> 37:57.358

37:57.400 --> 37:59.402

37:59.444 --> 38:02.114
Everybody here is safe,

37:59.444 --> 38:02.114

38:02.155 --> 38:04.574
Yeah, I'm glad you did too.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.119
And... thanks

38:04.616 --> 38:07.119
for looking out for me.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.413

38:10.455 --> 38:13.250

38:13.291 --> 38:15.001
I couldn't have done

38:13.291 --> 38:15.001
what I did without you.

38:15.043 --> 38:17.712
-Dr. Radford?

38:15.043 --> 38:17.712
-Oh, hey, I gotta go.

38:17.754 --> 38:20.465
-I'll see you tomorrow night.

38:17.754 --> 38:20.465
-I'll be waiting up for you.

38:20.506 --> 38:23.426
-You don't have to do that.

38:20.506 --> 38:23.426
-I'll do it anyway.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.178
-I love you.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.178
-I love you too.

38:30.433 --> 38:31.935
[sighing]

38:39.358 --> 38:41.069
-Hey, Cassie.

38:39.358 --> 38:41.069
-Hi.

38:41.111 --> 38:44.447
-I just got a call from Dad.

38:41.111 --> 38:44.447
-Yeah, he just called me too.

38:44.489 --> 38:47.075
It sounds like he's doing

38:44.489 --> 38:47.075
a lot of good down there.

38:47.117 --> 38:48.827
By the way, Mrs. Hannah

38:47.117 --> 38:48.827
was just here,

38:48.868 --> 38:51.913
and she told me

38:48.868 --> 38:51.913
that you helped her

38:48.868 --> 38:51.913
change a lightbulb.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.833
-It was dark.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.833
-Mmm-hmm.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.961
And then, after that,

38:54.874 --> 38:57.961
you took some cookies she made

38:54.874 --> 38:57.961
down to a homeless shelter

38:58.003 --> 38:59.921
and stayed there

38:58.003 --> 38:59.921
for a couple of hours.

38:59.963 --> 39:03.758
It was either that or go home

38:59.963 --> 39:03.758
and fill out those

38:59.963 --> 39:03.758
college applications, so...

39:03.800 --> 39:05.802
Is that the only reason

39:03.800 --> 39:05.802
you went,

39:05.844 --> 39:07.137
to get out of doing work?

39:07.179 --> 39:09.430
Or maybe because

39:07.179 --> 39:09.430
you really like to help people?

39:12.100 --> 39:13.310
I... I don't know.

39:14.519 --> 39:15.394
You know something, Nick?

39:15.436 --> 39:18.190
You are a lot like your father.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.983
And the world is gonna be

39:18.231 --> 39:19.983
a better place

39:20.025 --> 39:20.859
because you're in it.

39:22.152 --> 39:24.529
Once I decide

39:22.152 --> 39:24.529
what I'm actually gonna do.

39:24.570 --> 39:26.906
Well, maybe deciding

39:24.570 --> 39:26.906
what you're gonna do

39:26.948 --> 39:30.076
isn't as important

39:26.948 --> 39:30.076
as realizing who you are,

39:30.118 --> 39:31.577
because it's the goodness

39:30.118 --> 39:31.577
in a person

39:31.619 --> 39:33.246
that's really

39:31.619 --> 39:33.246
gonna change the world.

39:35.623 --> 39:38.501
So why did you want

39:35.623 --> 39:38.501
to come back to this old mill?

39:38.543 --> 39:40.045
Because I've decided

39:40.086 --> 39:41.754

39:40.086 --> 39:41.754

39:41.796 --> 39:44.883

39:44.924 --> 39:48.720
And... I've decided that

39:44.924 --> 39:48.720
this would be the perfect place

39:48.761 --> 39:51.348
to put my company's

39:48.761 --> 39:51.348
headquarters.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.642
-In a run-down old mill?

39:51.389 --> 39:54.642
-Yeah!

39:54.684 --> 39:57.354
I already put an application

39:54.684 --> 39:57.354
in with City Hall to buy it

39:57.395 --> 39:59.272
and restore it,

39:57.395 --> 39:59.272
and once I get the approval,

39:59.314 --> 40:01.149
I can start moving

39:59.314 --> 40:01.149
my operations here.

40:01.191 --> 40:02.901
So that means

40:01.191 --> 40:02.901
you'd be living in Middleton.

40:02.942 --> 40:05.570
-Yeah!

40:02.942 --> 40:05.570
-[both laughs]

40:05.611 --> 40:07.947

have to leave at all.
