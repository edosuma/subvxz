02:12.174 --> 02:14.075
Are you the one?

02:16.316 --> 02:18.051
Yes, my lady.

02:19.484 --> 02:21.419
I knew I would be whipped.

02:21.486 --> 02:23.521
If you speak
of your affections, Paolo,

02:23.588 --> 02:26.324
I will see you hanged
after you are whipped.

02:26.425 --> 02:28.159
Do you understand?

02:28.227 --> 02:31.062
- Yes, my lady.
- And it would be

02:31.130 --> 02:34.065
a shame to maim that body
of yours.

02:34.166 --> 02:37.435
For all the pleasure
it has given her.

02:37.502 --> 02:40.504
You will prepare us 2 horses
at dawn,

02:40.605 --> 02:43.406
already saddled.

02:53.883 --> 02:56.250
I had a dream, my son.

02:56.318 --> 02:58.352
Or a nightmare.

02:58.453 --> 03:00.354
Of Lucrezia?

03:00.456 --> 03:02.389
I dreamed

03:02.457 --> 03:05.126
that all of Italy had
deserted us--

03:07.063 --> 03:10.265
Sforzas, Colonnas.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.903
The French armies swarmed
through Rome

03:14.970 --> 03:17.906
like a cloud of locusts.

03:21.244 --> 03:24.246
On my feet...

03:24.314 --> 03:28.351
...were the simple sandals
of a Spanish peasant.

03:34.292 --> 03:36.894
Summon
the Spanish ambassador.

03:38.863 --> 03:40.898
He may be
our last hope.

03:50.909 --> 03:54.011
You must come
with us.

03:54.112 --> 03:57.814
My lord will kill you.
No. He will whip me.

03:57.882 --> 04:00.917
But it will
have been worth it.

04:01.018 --> 04:03.520
When will I see you
again?

04:03.588 --> 04:05.922
When you return
from Rome, perhaps.

04:05.990 --> 04:08.092
When horses fly,
as we must now.

04:08.193 --> 04:10.728
Before Lord Sforza awakes.

04:19.105 --> 04:23.641
We granted your King Ferdinand
and your Queen Isabella

04:23.709 --> 04:26.377
the title
of Most Catholic Majesties.

04:26.445 --> 04:29.280
We delivered

04:29.348 --> 04:33.017
a solemn papal bull,
granting them

04:33.084 --> 04:36.486
everlasting rights
over that vast new continent--

04:36.554 --> 04:39.122
But, with respect,
Holy Father,

04:39.223 --> 04:42.125
what you ask is impossible.

04:57.806 --> 05:01.109
The involvement
of Spanish forces

05:01.210 --> 05:03.578
in the protection
of St. Peter's

05:03.679 --> 05:06.281
and the head
of Christendom--

05:06.348 --> 05:10.752
Would amount to a declaration
of war between France and Spain.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.758
I warn you, Ambassador,

05:16.859 --> 05:19.294
favours granted can be
rescinded.

05:19.395 --> 05:21.863
And I would beg
Your Holiness's forgiveness

05:21.964 --> 05:24.932
that I cannot meet
his full demands.

05:33.674 --> 05:36.943
Must we face this...

05:37.044 --> 05:40.046
...French apocalypse
alone?

05:42.350 --> 05:46.153
The populace is
already fleeing Rome.

05:52.362 --> 05:56.699
Please thank
Their Royal Catholic Highnesses.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.435
And tell them...

05:59.536 --> 06:03.973
...our Saviour was kissed thus
by Judas Iscariot.

06:08.278 --> 06:11.347
We would review whatever
forces we have at our disposal.

06:11.415 --> 06:12.982
Where's your brother?

06:13.083 --> 06:15.985
I know not,
Holy Father, but...

06:16.086 --> 06:18.487
...I suspect.

06:18.554 --> 06:21.926
Well, then, seek out the
Gonfaloniere of the papal forces

06:21.928 --> 06:26.464
from whatever whorehouse
he's seen fit to rest his head!

07:00.230 --> 07:01.631
You know this man?

07:01.732 --> 07:05.000
No, Father.
He had no name last night.

07:09.939 --> 07:11.317
Brother.

07:11.342 --> 07:12.836
You have a priest
for a brother?

07:12.908 --> 07:15.643
- A cardinal.
- A cardinal?

07:15.710 --> 07:19.346
I should have charged you double.
I imagine you did. Ah!

07:23.485 --> 07:27.622
Your father would review the
forces at his command, Gonfaloniere.

07:27.723 --> 07:30.358
I am out of sorts
this morning, brother.

07:30.459 --> 07:32.194
This afternoon.

07:32.261 --> 07:34.529
Ah!

07:36.466 --> 07:38.433
Ah!
You know me, brother.

07:38.501 --> 07:42.637
I disapprove of lechery,
debauchery, drunkenness.

07:42.705 --> 07:45.106
Which is why our father made
you the cardinal.

07:45.174 --> 07:49.110
Why, then, did he make you
a duke?

07:49.178 --> 07:54.182
Because lechery and debauchery are
the very marks of nobility.

07:54.283 --> 07:57.385
Most of Italy has galloped
to the French side.

07:57.452 --> 08:00.388
They have heard a sound that is
new to their Italian ears:

08:00.456 --> 08:02.190
the sound of cannon.

08:02.257 --> 08:04.659
And the Gonfaloniere has
other duties besides lechery

08:04.760 --> 08:07.929
and debauchery. There is
the tedious business of war.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.436
Slow your horse, my love.

08:13.504 --> 08:16.306
You were ill, remember?

08:16.374 --> 08:18.274
And your condition needs
nurturing.

08:18.342 --> 08:22.845
Once out of that gloomy castle,
my health seems to improve.

08:22.946 --> 08:25.748
We did doubly well
to flee, then,

08:25.816 --> 08:29.352
and your father needs us both
at this perilous juncture.

08:29.419 --> 08:34.556
Now, you tell me
about this Paolo.

08:34.658 --> 08:37.659
You mean Narcissus?

08:39.662 --> 08:41.397
What would you know?

08:41.498 --> 08:43.832
Everything.

08:51.609 --> 08:54.411
Where are they heading?

08:56.381 --> 09:00.049
The horses were gone, my lord,
at dawn. I know not where.

09:00.151 --> 09:02.685
You mean they saddled them
without you stirring?

09:05.789 --> 09:07.490
They must have, my lord.

09:07.591 --> 09:10.860
You sleep
very soundly.

09:10.928 --> 09:13.596
Like a babe in arms,
my lord.

09:13.697 --> 09:15.664
You lie.

09:18.501 --> 09:20.469
Would it be in my interest
to lie, my lord,

09:20.536 --> 09:23.873
when my back is at your mercy?
Your entire being is at my mercy.

09:23.974 --> 09:25.408
The truth, peasant!

09:27.478 --> 09:31.781
Where are they heading?

09:42.893 --> 09:45.428
She is headed as far from you
as possible, my lord.

09:48.365 --> 09:50.800
She can no longer stand
the sight of you.

09:52.869 --> 09:54.503
The smell of you.

09:54.571 --> 09:57.339
The thought of you.

10:01.144 --> 10:03.145
And nor, my lord, can I.

10:09.919 --> 10:12.153
Peasant.

10:19.028 --> 10:21.764
We have pikes
for 2,000 footmen,

10:21.832 --> 10:26.235
lances for 1,000 horse,
bows for 1,500 bowmen--

10:26.303 --> 10:29.338
if we can find the soldiers
to wield them.

10:32.543 --> 10:34.812
What about cannon?

10:34.913 --> 10:39.517
Nobody worthy in the art
of war ever uses cannons.

10:39.584 --> 10:41.719
I have heard it rumoured
that the French do.

10:41.787 --> 10:43.721
And I have heard that they are
vulgarians, my lord.

10:43.789 --> 10:45.198
Their cannon was vulgar, indeed,

10:45.223 --> 10:46.736
when they brought
Lucca to its knees.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.227
I have a stratagem,

10:50.295 --> 10:53.531
Holy Father,

10:53.632 --> 10:56.735
to outwit their cannon.

10:56.803 --> 11:01.707
Would you be so good
as to... share it with us?

11:05.345 --> 11:07.179
Indeed.

11:07.247 --> 11:09.649
Just give me some time
with my condottieri.

11:09.750 --> 11:12.252
Time is
what we do not have!

11:12.319 --> 11:14.988
The barbarians are
approaching.

11:15.089 --> 11:18.458
Rome has been sacked twice
in her past.

11:18.525 --> 11:22.628
We would spare her
a third such indignity.

11:31.303 --> 11:33.537
Cardinal.

11:47.453 --> 11:49.655
There are precedents,
of course, Your Highness,

11:49.756 --> 11:51.724
for the deposition
of the Pope of Rome.

11:51.792 --> 11:54.293
The Council of Constance,
for example.

11:54.395 --> 11:58.631
There were 3 popes
with claims upon the papacy.

11:58.699 --> 11:59.700
Three?

11:59.725 --> 12:02.608
It was a schism, Your
Highness, a state to be avoided

12:02.636 --> 12:05.670
at all costs.
Pope John XXIII,

12:05.772 --> 12:10.375
Pope Benedict XIII,
and Pope Gregory XII.

12:10.442 --> 12:12.476
One of them held court
in Avignon.

12:12.544 --> 12:13.899
Yes, Your Highness.

12:13.924 --> 12:16.733
Commonly referred to
as the Avignon Captivity.

12:18.416 --> 12:21.485
And what was the outcome
of the Council of Constance?

12:21.586 --> 12:26.657
Well, Pope John XXIII was
accused of various indiscretions.

12:26.758 --> 12:30.461
And of what do you accuse
this Borgia pope?

12:30.529 --> 12:34.933
Simony, usury,
public lechery,

12:35.001 --> 12:37.737
and poisoning, perhaps.

12:37.804 --> 12:40.740
So, your brother has
a stratagem.

12:40.808 --> 12:43.275
Dreamed up
in last night's whorehouse.

12:45.212 --> 12:47.681
You will cease,
Cardinal Borgia,

12:47.782 --> 12:49.916
in this constant denigration
of your brother,

12:49.984 --> 12:52.786
the Gonfaloniere.
His leadership

12:52.854 --> 12:56.223
of the papal forces is
at present our only hope!

12:56.291 --> 12:58.292
Which is the source
of my concern, Father.

13:00.262 --> 13:04.499
We have summoned an assembly
of the College of Cardinals.

13:04.567 --> 13:07.769
Now, we are aware--
painfully aware--

13:07.870 --> 13:10.405
how readily they would
abandon our papacy

13:10.506 --> 13:12.974
in this hour
of greatest need.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.977
But you, Cardinal,

13:15.045 --> 13:19.048
shall be our support
in this crisis.

13:19.115 --> 13:22.885
You will express
every confidence in the arms

13:22.986 --> 13:27.156
at our disposal, under the leadership
of your beloved brother.

13:31.561 --> 13:35.764
They are like rats, my son,
deserting a sinking ship.

13:37.700 --> 13:41.403
Thus our Saviour was abandoned
by his Apostles,

13:41.471 --> 13:44.039
in his hour
of greatest need.

13:52.149 --> 13:53.616
...without protection,

13:53.684 --> 13:56.085
everyone moment we stay here is
at our peril.

14:06.765 --> 14:10.369
Holy Father,
it is rumoured

14:10.470 --> 14:15.808
that the Colonna arms are
rushing to join the French side.

14:15.876 --> 14:19.278
Cardinal Colonna could
perhaps answer that.

14:19.346 --> 14:24.283
They are in danger of being beaten
to the race by the armies of the Sforza.

14:24.384 --> 14:27.620
Cardinal Sforza?

14:27.688 --> 14:31.823
Holy Father,
we should abandon Rome.

14:31.891 --> 14:35.627
Half the populace already has.

14:35.728 --> 14:39.965
The Holy Father forbids
any talk of abandonment.

14:41.867 --> 14:45.836
We have all of us taken our vows
as cardinals

14:45.904 --> 14:49.339
to spill our blood in defence
of our Holy Mother Church.

14:49.407 --> 14:52.742
We wait like lambs
to be slaughtered?

14:52.843 --> 14:55.978
The Holy Father has reviewed
the papal forces.

14:56.046 --> 14:58.380
He has every confidence

14:58.482 --> 15:01.451
in their ability
to defend the Holy City.

15:03.220 --> 15:06.022
As have I!

15:35.253 --> 15:40.557
Too often
has this city been abandoned

15:40.624 --> 15:43.760
at a time
of intimate threat.

15:43.861 --> 15:47.130
We have all of us been

15:47.231 --> 15:50.300
chosen by God...

15:52.236 --> 15:54.837
...to represent

15:54.905 --> 15:59.309
his Holy Church.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.043
And who knows?

16:01.145 --> 16:05.215
Perhaps God
in His infinite wisdom

16:05.282 --> 16:08.018
has sent us this trial,

16:09.954 --> 16:13.323
this... test

16:13.391 --> 16:15.559
of our faith in Him.

16:20.564 --> 16:24.968
The Pope of Rome shall stay
in Rome,

16:25.069 --> 16:27.371
in the Vatican,

16:27.439 --> 16:30.040
in St. Peter's.

16:30.141 --> 16:33.243
And he has
every confidence

16:33.344 --> 16:37.815
that the College of Cardinals
shall do so too.

16:39.717 --> 16:44.954
Each one of you shall be called
to account.

16:46.923 --> 16:52.494
Do not let the Most High God
find you wanting.

16:59.468 --> 17:02.069
It is settled then.

17:04.373 --> 17:07.608
We shall stay in Rome.

17:29.564 --> 17:31.600
See, up ahead.

17:31.701 --> 17:34.069
Who is it?

17:34.170 --> 17:37.172
We must turn back.

17:39.075 --> 17:41.410
They are French,
are they not?

17:58.358 --> 18:01.494
These are dangerous roads,
fair ladies.

18:01.562 --> 18:03.162
So it seems.

18:05.065 --> 18:07.333
- And you are heading?
- To Rome.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.136
Well, then.

18:10.203 --> 18:13.005
You have an escort
of French arms. Bring them!

18:13.106 --> 18:15.341
- Yes, Captain!
<i>- En allez!</i>

18:17.276 --> 18:19.911
On the way!

18:20.013 --> 18:23.448
What is cannon for,
Holy Father?

18:23.516 --> 18:27.985
For destroying fortification,
surely.

18:28.087 --> 18:29.987
Exactly.

18:30.088 --> 18:34.258
The French cannon may be useful
to batter the gates of Rome,

18:34.359 --> 18:37.527
or to blow the walls of Lucca
to the heavens,

18:37.595 --> 18:39.796
but meet them
in the open field,

18:39.864 --> 18:42.800
and what use are
their cannon there?

18:44.703 --> 18:46.171
My son.

18:46.238 --> 18:49.007
And I propose
our armies do precisely that.

18:49.075 --> 18:51.343
Meet them far from Rome
in the open field,

18:51.411 --> 18:52.846
where the advantage
of their cannon

18:52.871 --> 18:55.967
is like blowing thistles
in the wind.

18:56.417 --> 19:00.821
Our cavalry can feint
around their rear,

19:00.922 --> 19:04.291
our bowmen target
their gunners.

19:04.392 --> 19:06.828
The Roman genius is
for strategy

19:06.895 --> 19:10.932
and rapid movement;
let us use it to the full.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.901
And annihilate those

19:12.968 --> 19:14.903
French barbarians

19:14.970 --> 19:16.905
with their lumbering
metal cannon.

19:16.972 --> 19:19.474
See how fast
they can turn them round.

19:22.645 --> 19:24.847
Do you agree,
brother?

19:28.652 --> 19:31.988
I know little
of the art of war.

19:32.056 --> 19:35.859
Well, thank God someone
in this family does.

19:35.927 --> 19:38.295
We shall outwit them

19:38.363 --> 19:42.665
before they even get sight
of our fair city, Rome.

19:42.733 --> 19:45.935
And like Julius Caesar,

19:46.003 --> 19:49.005
like Mark Anthony,

19:49.072 --> 19:51.674
we will chase
those barbarian invaders

19:51.775 --> 19:53.676
back across the Alps,

19:53.777 --> 19:56.478
dragging their cannon
with them.

19:56.546 --> 20:00.315
Am... I... correct,

20:00.383 --> 20:02.050
Father?

20:02.151 --> 20:04.853
Well, we can breathe again,
my son.

20:04.921 --> 20:07.390
The air is almost sweet
with relief.

20:07.491 --> 20:09.592
You...

20:09.660 --> 20:13.329
...will be the saviour
of Rome.

20:49.765 --> 20:54.669
Will the good Lord see the justice
in our cause, Micheletto?

20:54.737 --> 20:58.306
Where warfare is concerned,
Your Eminence,

20:58.374 --> 21:01.343
our good Lord will take
a holiday.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.608
Have you ever seen
such an army?

21:34.709 --> 21:37.310
Not since Hannibal
crossed the Alps, my lady.

21:37.378 --> 21:39.346
That is
what my brother faces.

21:39.447 --> 21:42.716
Your brother is
a Roman soldier?

21:42.784 --> 21:45.720
He is to be pitied, then.

21:45.821 --> 21:49.157
You must introduce us
to your Hannibal, Captain.

21:49.258 --> 21:50.792
And your names are?

21:50.860 --> 21:54.262
Tell him
that Lucrezia Borgia,

21:54.330 --> 21:56.999
daughter
to the Pope of Rome,

21:57.100 --> 22:00.069
and Giulia Farnese request
the pleasure

22:00.136 --> 22:02.638
of his company.

22:08.912 --> 22:12.148
How many times
have I had to tell you...

22:22.758 --> 22:26.260
- We have a captive, my liege.
- What kind of captive?

22:26.361 --> 22:29.264
Quite a prize, I am told.
A Borgia.

22:29.365 --> 22:33.201
A Borgia?

22:33.269 --> 22:35.837
The pope's bastard daughter,
fleeing her husband,

22:35.904 --> 22:38.106
Giovanni Sforza.
Ran into our hands.

22:38.173 --> 22:41.008
- A hostage, then?
- If it pleases you.

22:41.109 --> 22:44.912
And the pope's own mistress,
Giulia Farnese.

22:44.980 --> 22:48.282
This pope has a mistress?

22:48.350 --> 22:49.984
For shame.

22:52.254 --> 22:55.456
Then he must surely
be done away with.

22:59.661 --> 23:05.199
Why have I no mistress,
General?

23:05.267 --> 23:07.935
We need a stratagem,
Giulia Farnese.

23:08.036 --> 23:11.105
- How to achieve our freedom.
- We are quite

23:11.172 --> 23:14.274
uniquely situated
to use what...

23:14.342 --> 23:17.277
...weapons we have
in our father's cause.

23:17.344 --> 23:20.446
And what weapons are those,
my love?

23:20.547 --> 23:22.948
As you told me
when I first met you:

23:23.049 --> 23:25.484
our beauty.

23:25.552 --> 23:27.852
Our wit.

23:32.858 --> 23:35.192
- Cardinal.
<i>- La bella.</i>

23:37.128 --> 23:40.498
I trust the French soldiery
caused you both no disquiet?

23:40.566 --> 23:44.369
- Are we hostages, Cardinal?
- On the contrary, Madame,

23:44.437 --> 23:45.987
you are being detained
for your own protection.

23:46.353 --> 23:49.463
Good! I would not like
to be imprisoned.

23:49.910 --> 23:55.415
It would so displease
my father, the pope.

23:55.483 --> 23:59.186
As, I am afraid,
would your presence here.

23:59.254 --> 24:01.188
No longer a man of God?

24:01.256 --> 24:04.658
A soldier now?
I serve still God, my lady.

24:04.726 --> 24:07.861
That would please my father.
He would not like

24:07.928 --> 24:11.664
to see blood
on a cardinal's hands.

24:11.765 --> 24:14.133
So why are you here

24:14.234 --> 24:17.336
with the French armies?
I am in your presence

24:17.437 --> 24:20.060
to invite you both to dine
with His Royal Highness,

24:20.085 --> 24:22.006
King Charles of France.

24:24.111 --> 24:26.947
Which invitation
we graciously accept,

24:27.048 --> 24:29.951
do we not, Lucrezia?

24:30.018 --> 24:32.356
But you have not yet told us,
Cardinal, why you are here

24:32.381 --> 24:34.901
with the French armies?

24:35.425 --> 24:37.326
I am travelling
with the French king

24:37.393 --> 24:40.862
to institute the deposition
of your father as Pope of Rome.

24:40.930 --> 24:44.033
Oh, dear.

24:44.100 --> 24:46.235
That is certainly a reason.

24:46.336 --> 24:51.574
On what grounds?
Simony, bribery,

24:51.641 --> 24:54.876
and if you will both forgive
my mention of such indelicacies,

24:54.944 --> 24:57.846
fair ladies,
public lechery.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.848
Public lechery?

25:01.784 --> 25:05.621
With whom?
With your good self, my lady.

25:05.722 --> 25:10.593
So a pope cannot be lecherous,
Cardinal,

25:10.661 --> 25:15.265
in public
or in private?

25:15.367 --> 25:17.902
He cannot, my lady.

25:20.405 --> 25:25.141
But is a pope's daughter
allowed to be hungry?

25:25.209 --> 25:29.812
If so, I would gladly accept
the king's invitation.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.815
Because
this pope's daughter...

25:32.883 --> 25:35.051
...could eat a horse.

25:41.958 --> 25:47.062
We are unused to kings
in Italy, Your Highness.

25:47.130 --> 25:49.998
We do have dukes,
duchesses,

25:50.099 --> 25:53.002
principes, cardinals.
We even have,

25:53.070 --> 25:55.905
as you must know,
a pope.

25:55.973 --> 26:00.443
But kings are
in short supply.

26:00.544 --> 26:03.380
I have novelty value,
then.

26:05.583 --> 26:08.251
No more wine
for the moment.

26:08.319 --> 26:10.286
Why not?

26:10.387 --> 26:12.889
I would tell
Your Highness's fortune.

26:12.957 --> 26:15.926
- His fortune?
- Yes. In the cup.

26:15.993 --> 26:17.928
My mother taught me.

26:17.996 --> 26:21.266
She was a courtesan,
Your Highness.

26:21.367 --> 26:22.801
Really?

26:22.869 --> 26:24.637
The prettiest in Rome.

26:24.704 --> 26:26.572
And she knew her runes.

26:30.711 --> 26:32.111
I see...

26:32.179 --> 26:36.550
...one great army...

26:36.618 --> 26:38.486
...meet another.

26:38.587 --> 26:40.988
Is there a winner?

26:42.890 --> 26:45.825
There.
And I see his face.

26:45.893 --> 26:49.195
Is it handsome,
this face?

26:49.262 --> 26:51.630
No, I would not

26:51.698 --> 26:53.365
call it handsome.

26:53.433 --> 26:56.201
- Is it... ugly, then?
- No.

26:56.302 --> 26:58.203
No.

26:58.304 --> 27:02.039
But there is a great...
blemish upon it.

27:02.140 --> 27:04.108
What is this blemish?

27:04.176 --> 27:06.844
Come closer, my liege.

27:06.945 --> 27:08.646
I would have you see it too.

27:08.714 --> 27:12.751
It looks alarmingly

27:12.852 --> 27:16.022
like a nose.

27:16.090 --> 27:19.726
A nose!
Is it ugly, this nose?

27:19.794 --> 27:21.825
It is exceedingly ugly,
Your Highness.

27:21.850 --> 27:23.263
Like mine?

27:23.381 --> 27:26.011
No, not at all
like yours.

27:27.102 --> 27:31.006
The visage I saw in this cup was
not yours, Your Highness.

27:31.074 --> 27:34.877
It has none
of the grace,

27:34.978 --> 27:37.046
the valour,

27:37.114 --> 27:39.682
the openness.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.853
And now...

27:45.955 --> 27:47.422
Pah! It is gone.

27:47.490 --> 27:50.692
More wine for His Highness.

27:59.167 --> 28:02.069
And the winner that you saw
in the cup, Lucrezia...

28:02.170 --> 28:05.106
Was not as handsome as you,
Your Highness.

28:05.174 --> 28:07.142
Nor as gracious.

28:07.243 --> 28:09.110
Nor as kind.

28:11.180 --> 28:13.349
Has he a name?

28:13.417 --> 28:16.619
- Nobody.
- Oh...

28:16.687 --> 28:19.588
There was no winner.

28:19.656 --> 28:23.058
No loser either.
And no battle?

28:23.160 --> 28:24.893
What a pity.

28:27.263 --> 28:29.130
Your Highness likes
battle?

28:29.198 --> 28:32.333
Mmm.
Longs for it.

28:32.401 --> 28:37.404
Let me show you,
fair Lucrezia,

28:37.472 --> 28:40.775
our ways of battle

28:40.842 --> 28:42.943
tomorrow.

29:48.978 --> 29:51.112
My God.

29:53.048 --> 29:55.516
So our stratagem was,

29:55.584 --> 29:58.386
Gonfaloniere,

29:58.487 --> 30:00.154
a feint to their left.

30:00.221 --> 30:03.156
But I can see no left.

30:03.224 --> 30:05.292
Or right.

30:08.229 --> 30:11.631
Their army fills
the whole horizon.

30:18.304 --> 30:22.641
The pikes of our
infantry are 12 feet long.

30:22.742 --> 30:25.176
Can you see them there,
my dear?

30:25.244 --> 30:28.480
Why are the blades hooked so,
my lord?

30:28.548 --> 30:33.018
So they can tear out the guts
of their opponents.

30:33.119 --> 30:36.021
But we begin battle
with the cannon.

30:36.089 --> 30:38.190
- The cannon?
- Yes.

30:38.258 --> 30:42.261
Never risk a man until you've
used your artillery.

30:42.329 --> 30:44.897
Learned that
against the English.

30:47.467 --> 30:50.403
I thought cannon were
for purposes of siege,

30:50.470 --> 30:52.571
to break down walls,
and such.

30:52.672 --> 30:55.841
Ah,
but in the open field,

30:55.942 --> 30:59.478
we have our own invention.

30:59.546 --> 31:03.849
Chained cannonballs.

31:03.917 --> 31:09.221
- Chained cannonballs?
- Cuts through a front line

31:09.322 --> 31:11.289
like a scythe
through butter.

31:11.357 --> 31:14.458
Cannons!
Man the cannons!

31:14.526 --> 31:15.760
Cannons!

31:15.861 --> 31:17.928
Soldiers!
At the ready.

31:20.731 --> 31:23.600
Man the cannons!

31:27.604 --> 31:30.306
Prepare to load!

31:30.407 --> 31:32.642
Cannoneers
to your guns!

31:32.709 --> 31:36.478
Who gives the command
to charge?

31:36.579 --> 31:38.947
You do, my lord.

31:41.851 --> 31:43.852
Load the cannons!

31:45.789 --> 31:47.924
Load powder!

31:54.198 --> 31:56.700
Is the cannon loud,
Your Highness?

31:56.768 --> 31:58.835
Exceedingly.

32:02.106 --> 32:05.142
I would cover your ears,
my dear.

32:16.787 --> 32:20.423
- Back in positions!
- Target ready!

32:22.058 --> 32:25.895
- Cannon ready, Captain.
- Central cannons, fire!

32:27.899 --> 32:30.700
Fire!

32:34.639 --> 32:37.441
Run!

32:41.279 --> 32:43.614
Fire!

32:49.221 --> 32:52.790
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

32:56.128 --> 32:59.163
- Stay in line, men!
- Back to the front!

32:59.231 --> 33:02.700
Back, men,
to the front!!

33:02.767 --> 33:04.335
Stand fast, men!

33:04.403 --> 33:07.405
- Formations!
- Stand fast!

33:07.473 --> 33:11.175
- Central cannons reload!
- Reload!

33:11.276 --> 33:12.821
Check the distance!

33:12.846 --> 33:14.669
- Your Highness?
- Yes, my dear?

33:14.813 --> 33:16.324
Could you halt the cannon
for a moment?

33:16.951 --> 33:18.543
Pardon?

33:18.568 --> 33:20.404
Could you halt
the cannon for a moment?

33:21.454 --> 33:23.889
- But why?
- In position!

33:23.990 --> 33:27.392
You were right.
They are exceedingly loud.

33:27.493 --> 33:30.162
Take aim!

33:36.168 --> 33:38.269
- Ready, Captain!
- Your Highness?

33:38.370 --> 33:40.471
Wait.

33:46.646 --> 33:48.613
Stand fast, men!

33:48.681 --> 33:51.082
- Stand fast.
- Is it the white flag?

33:51.184 --> 33:54.085
A parlay?

33:57.423 --> 33:59.925
It's my sister.

34:00.026 --> 34:02.427
Hold the line!
Form up!

34:02.495 --> 34:04.362
We are in danger of losing
the initiative, Your Highness--

34:04.463 --> 34:05.830
Shh!

34:05.898 --> 34:07.633
Your Highness,
I strongly urge you to take--

34:07.700 --> 34:10.068
You will wait.

34:10.136 --> 34:13.438
I will not harm her.

34:13.505 --> 34:17.842
- Lucrezia. My God.
- They hold us hostage, brother.

34:17.911 --> 34:20.279
- Us?
- Giulia Farnese and I.

34:20.346 --> 34:23.282
We were riding to Rome.
Ride on then.

34:23.349 --> 34:26.585
Would you survive this day,
dear Juan?

34:26.686 --> 34:29.655
- We have a battle to fight.
- Believe me,

34:29.723 --> 34:32.123
you have lost it already.
It has hardly begun.

34:32.225 --> 34:34.139
I have heard one roar
of cannon.

34:34.164 --> 34:35.918
A hundred more and
your whole army will be dead

34:35.995 --> 34:38.353
and bleeding. And you have yet
to see their pikes.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.427
- I will not accept defeat!
- Then do not call it that.

34:41.766 --> 34:44.203
- Ready!
- Call it common sense.

34:44.270 --> 34:48.274
Say the French King got asked
for terms. You offered...

34:48.342 --> 34:50.310
What did I offer?

34:50.378 --> 34:54.114
His safe passage to Naples
in exchange for...

34:54.181 --> 34:57.385
...his bloodless entry
into Rome.

34:57.452 --> 35:00.388
Lucrezia,
he will pillage the place;

35:00.456 --> 35:02.390
depose our father!

35:02.458 --> 35:04.859
Leave that to me.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.570
- Yah!
- Ready!

35:17.908 --> 35:21.578
Target ready!

35:21.646 --> 35:24.681
Target ready!

35:26.751 --> 35:29.520
It was my brother,
Your Highness!

35:29.588 --> 35:30.920
Your brother?

35:30.945 --> 35:33.038
The Gonfaloniere
of the papal armies.

35:33.726 --> 35:36.662
He thought
you meant to sack Rome.

35:36.729 --> 35:39.231
Like the Goths
and Vandal hordes.

35:39.332 --> 35:41.934
I told him
you were a gentleman.

35:42.001 --> 35:44.036
You had no such idea.

35:46.339 --> 35:49.207
You had no such idea,
had you?

35:49.274 --> 35:52.210
No such idea.

35:52.277 --> 35:54.779
Your goal is Naples.

35:58.250 --> 36:01.619
Naples.
Of course.

36:01.721 --> 36:03.988
So,

36:04.056 --> 36:07.326
my brother,
the Duke of Gandia,

36:07.393 --> 36:09.962
the Gonfaloniere
of the papal armies,

36:10.030 --> 36:14.067
bids you welcome
to Rome.

36:18.773 --> 36:21.409
Forward!

36:35.856 --> 36:37.890
Why the hurry, Cardinal?

36:37.991 --> 36:40.159
You have heard?

36:40.227 --> 36:44.730
We have heard the sun rose
as always this morning.

36:44.832 --> 36:48.902
We have heard a lark singing
through the casement window.

36:49.003 --> 36:51.784
But the Sistine choir at matins
was silent.

36:51.809 --> 36:53.846
Perhaps they have
heard what you have heard.

36:53.875 --> 36:56.344
Your son's army is
in retreat.

36:56.412 --> 36:59.447
The French plague is
almost upon us.

36:59.515 --> 37:02.151
Did you not swear
a solemn oath,

37:02.218 --> 37:05.454
when you first donned
that cardinal's red, to spill

37:05.522 --> 37:07.823
your blood in defence
of the Christian faith?

37:07.925 --> 37:10.660
My cardinal's oath is
not the issue here.

37:10.761 --> 37:13.831
- Then what is?
- You, Holy Father!

37:13.899 --> 37:17.435
The French King has but
one intent: your deposition.

37:17.503 --> 37:20.471
I understand.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.540
You would protect
yourselves and not us.

37:22.608 --> 37:25.543
You could ride
with us, Holy Father,

37:25.611 --> 37:29.080
to the safety of Ostia.
Our place is here.

37:30.983 --> 37:33.652
As is yours,
Cardinal Sforza.

37:33.753 --> 37:36.488
You should leave,
Holy Father.

37:36.589 --> 37:38.256
We will stay here.

37:38.324 --> 37:41.660
And we shall be here

37:41.728 --> 37:44.029
when you return.

37:44.097 --> 37:47.566
IF you return.

38:13.126 --> 38:16.395
You may need those tomes,
Burchart,

38:16.496 --> 38:20.600
in whatever haven
you are fleeing to.

38:20.701 --> 38:25.237
I would preserve these books
for posterity, Your Holiness.

38:25.338 --> 38:27.939
For posterity?

38:28.041 --> 38:30.575
They have survived
many invasions.

38:30.676 --> 38:33.946
I will do my best
to ensure they survive this one.

38:37.417 --> 38:40.318
Take care, then,
you preserve this book

38:40.420 --> 38:44.856
on the Council of Constance.

38:44.924 --> 38:49.561
You may need it
in the near future.

38:49.628 --> 38:52.697
Why, Your Holiness?

38:54.666 --> 38:57.768
For the proceedings
of our deposition.

38:57.869 --> 39:03.774
And if you are asked
for an opinion, you will state--

39:03.875 --> 39:06.877
as I know you will--

39:06.978 --> 39:10.948
that a College of Cardinals
which elected a pope

39:11.016 --> 39:13.517
deemed to be iniquitous

39:13.618 --> 39:19.256
can itself depose
said iniquitous pope.

39:26.063 --> 39:28.798
Must you all desert me?

39:28.899 --> 39:34.069
I would preserve these books,
Your Holiness.

39:34.137 --> 39:36.304
I know, I know.

39:38.274 --> 39:40.308
For posterity.

40:00.765 --> 40:03.166
Do they look
victorious, Micheletto?

40:03.267 --> 40:04.510
No, Your Eminence.

40:04.535 --> 40:06.831
They are merely tired
and exhausted.

40:07.705 --> 40:11.606
The exhaustion
of battle, surely.

40:11.674 --> 40:14.142
The exhaustion
of retreat.

40:14.210 --> 40:17.145
Is that why
I see no prisoners?

40:17.213 --> 40:20.548
You see no prisoners
because there are none.

40:20.616 --> 40:22.817
Where are the French?
Are they coming?

40:22.918 --> 40:25.153
And Rome is
like an old whore,

40:25.221 --> 40:28.324
waiting once more
for her ravishment.

40:30.260 --> 40:32.996
What will happen
to Rome?

40:49.046 --> 40:50.613
Father.

40:54.417 --> 40:57.018
Do not blame him,
Cesare,

40:57.119 --> 41:00.888
for retreating
before the French hordes.

41:00.956 --> 41:04.926
They have Lucrezia as hostage.
Have you heard?

41:04.993 --> 41:08.362
If they harm her...

41:11.633 --> 41:14.001
Cowards.

41:14.102 --> 41:15.836
Vermin!

41:15.937 --> 41:18.472
Rats deserting
a sinking ship!

41:20.475 --> 41:23.478
You're like lemmings running
to your doom! Do you think

41:23.579 --> 41:27.114
a golden chalice will
save you?

41:30.886 --> 41:33.988
Your brother did not fail,
Cesare. Your father did.

41:36.325 --> 41:40.663
Your father, who placed that
responsibility upon his shoulders.

41:42.632 --> 41:44.667
Who was blinded...

41:46.604 --> 41:49.540
...by paternal fondness.

41:49.608 --> 41:52.488
Your father,
who has been abandoned

41:52.513 --> 41:55.068
by all that once supported him.

41:55.781 --> 41:59.017
Your father, who...

41:59.085 --> 42:02.321
...faces his dark night
of the soul.

42:05.091 --> 42:06.958
Alone.

42:13.198 --> 42:16.233
I will not leave you,
Father.

42:34.754 --> 42:36.756
Father.

42:38.659 --> 42:40.326
My son.

42:40.394 --> 42:43.029
We had no choice
but retreat.

42:43.097 --> 42:45.865
There's not a moment
to lose.

42:45.966 --> 42:47.500
So we believe.

42:47.601 --> 42:50.236
The guards will take you
to safety in Ostia.

42:50.337 --> 42:52.472
No, we will stay
here in Rome, my son.

42:52.539 --> 42:56.776
- The Castell St. Angelo then.
- We will stay here

42:56.877 --> 42:59.478
in this Vatican.

42:59.546 --> 43:02.614
The papal guard and yourself will
take your mother to safety in Ostia.

43:02.715 --> 43:07.953
- But Father...
- Would you see her defenceless

43:08.021 --> 43:11.323
before the French invasion?

43:17.096 --> 43:19.164
Go.

43:21.034 --> 43:23.869
GO!

43:57.007 --> 44:00.342
At times such as these,
Brother Raphael...

44:07.516 --> 44:10.085
...one needs old friends.

44:20.830 --> 44:23.097
We have been called

44:23.199 --> 44:24.899
to trial.

44:26.869 --> 44:29.337
We hope
we will not be found wanting.

44:29.405 --> 44:32.107
Your very presence here,
Your Holiness,

44:32.208 --> 44:35.010
attests that you have not.

44:37.881 --> 44:40.650
Attests.

44:40.751 --> 44:44.386
I like that word,
good friar.

44:44.488 --> 44:48.390
It speaks of fortitude

44:48.491 --> 44:52.394
in the face of threat.

44:52.495 --> 44:55.164
It speaks of bearing witness

44:55.231 --> 44:57.800
in the face of falsity.

44:59.769 --> 45:02.304
It speaks of...

45:04.240 --> 45:06.308
...courage.

45:17.452 --> 45:19.487
Your clothes.

45:19.588 --> 45:22.656
My clothes?

45:22.757 --> 45:25.560
Your humble tunic.

45:25.627 --> 45:30.497
The cowl you wear.
Those unadorned sandals.

45:30.565 --> 45:34.668
But why do you need
my clothes, Holy Father?

45:34.736 --> 45:36.403
We would wear them.

45:36.504 --> 45:41.107
- You would disguise yourself?
- No, not at all.

45:41.208 --> 45:44.011
I would face this trial
that approaches,

45:44.078 --> 45:48.181
against which the entirety
of Rome has fled,

45:48.249 --> 45:52.284
without the trappings
of Holy Office. I would

45:52.352 --> 45:55.554
face it as our Saviour faced
His great trial:

45:55.621 --> 45:57.556
in a simple robe,

45:57.623 --> 46:00.759
sandals on our bare feet,

46:00.826 --> 46:06.398
with nothing but our faith
in God to adorn us.

46:19.281 --> 46:21.315
Why are you here?

46:21.416 --> 46:25.518
- I want you to leave.
- I cannot. I have taken vows.

46:25.586 --> 46:28.221
You will be defenceless
when the French army arrives.

46:28.288 --> 46:30.657
I must put my trust
in Jesus, then.

46:30.724 --> 46:34.126
No. You will put your trust
in me.

46:34.194 --> 46:36.962
I will not have you
without protection.

46:37.063 --> 46:39.231
Do you not understand?

46:39.298 --> 46:41.866
I cannot have you
near me, Cesare.

46:41.934 --> 46:44.336
I would betray our Saviour
in a moment.

46:44.437 --> 46:46.772
You said my name.

46:46.873 --> 46:48.774
I have...

46:48.875 --> 46:54.047
...made a promise.
A sacred vow.

46:54.148 --> 46:57.150
I am sorry.

46:57.218 --> 46:59.152
Will you allow me

46:59.220 --> 47:01.855
to at least afford
the abbey protection?

47:01.923 --> 47:04.057
Place guards
on the gates?

47:04.125 --> 47:08.161
You are our benefactor,
Cardinal.

48:19.399 --> 48:21.467
Well.
