I'm a tube

08:28.933 --> 08:30.433
of pepperoni toothpaste.

08:30.433 --> 08:33.700
That's a crazy combination.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.100
Do you like it?

08:35.100 --> 08:36.867
>> Nah.

08:36.867 --> 08:38.300
What are you?

08:38.300 --> 08:40.767
>> A basket of dirty laundry.

08:40.767 --> 08:42.800
>> Oh, perfect.

08:42.800 --> 08:43.967
My gym clothes haven't been

08:43.967 --> 08:45.967
washed in three weeks.

08:45.967 --> 08:48.300
>> Ew.

08:48.300 --> 08:50.567
>> Please use fabric softener.

08:50.567 --> 08:51.600
>> Wait, I'm not doing your--

08:51.600 --> 08:53.467
>> Hudson...

08:53.467 --> 08:54.300
>> He expects me

08:54.300 --> 08:56.533

>> [ sniffs ]

08:57.633 --> 08:59.867
They smell like hamburgers.

09:04.433 --> 09:08.267
Is... is that a Double G mask?

09:08.267 --> 09:10.767
>> Boo.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.767
It is Double G.

09:13.767 --> 09:15.067
>> So, your Halloween costume

09:15.067 --> 09:16.467
is yourself?

09:16.467 --> 09:18.700
>> Who else would I want to be?

09:18.700 --> 09:20.300
>> Look, why are you here?

09:20.300 --> 09:22.300
>> Because you two girls

09:22.300 --> 09:23.167
are going to help me

09:23.167 --> 09:23.867

09:23.867 --> 09:25.633
out of Triple G.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.067
>> No we're not.

09:27.067 --> 09:27.800
>> Aw, come on.

09:27.800 --> 09:28.700
I've scared him every Halloween

09:28.700 --> 09:29.767
since he was born.

09:29.767 --> 09:31.533
He loves it.

09:31.533 --> 09:32.933
>> I don't think he does.

09:32.933 --> 09:34.300
>> He kind of hates it.

09:34.300 --> 09:35.133
>> Okay, you girls

09:35.133 --> 09:36.367
just don't understand.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.600
A father/son relationship

09:37.600 --> 09:39.067

09:39.067 --> 09:40.433
>> Well, yeah,

09:40.433 --> 09:43.200
when you're the father.

>> Anyway, we're not going

09:44.067 --> 09:45.067

>> All right, well, look...

09:47.067 --> 09:48.167
I'm going to get Trip.

09:48.167 --> 09:49.933
Now, you can help me get him

09:49.933 --> 09:51.333
or else you two might

09:51.333 --> 09:53.467
get your own little

09:58.200 --> 09:58.867
>> So, how are we going

09:58.867 --> 09:59.800

>> Yeah.

10:01.933 --> 10:03.933
>> Yeah.

>> Yeah.

10:05.467 --> 10:12.367
>> Yeah.

10:12.367 --> 10:14.267
>> Oh, come on, that math test

10:14.267 --> 10:15.900
was impossible.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.700
>> Well, did you study for it?

10:17.700 --> 10:20.000
>> No. What's your point?

10:24.700 --> 10:26.900
Hi, Hudson.

>> I don't know.

>> I don't know where Trip is.

10:37.167 --> 10:38.667
>> Okay.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.067
Where's Trip?

10:40.067 --> 10:41.233
>> Well, that depends

10:41.233 --> 10:45.833
on what you mean by "Where's?"

[ text alert ]

10:56.767 --> 10:57.500
>> One...

10:57.500 --> 10:59.700
>> Take it.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.600
>> Is it a text from Trip?

11:01.600 --> 11:02.167
>> Yep.

11:02.167 --> 11:05.133
It says, "Get off me, man.

11:05.133 --> 11:09.067
Seriously, get off me."

11:09.067 --> 11:11.067
>> What does that mean?

11:11.067 --> 11:12.333
>> Get off me, man.

11:12.333 --> 11:14.200
Seriously, get off me.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.567
Get off me.

11:15.567 --> 11:17.967
>> You realize we can hear that.

11:17.967 --> 11:21.367
>> Oh, that's just my colon.

11:21.367 --> 11:22.900
Calm down, girl.

11:22.900 --> 11:27.333
>> Get off me.

11:37.067 --> 11:38.367
to hide in the couch.

11:38.367 --> 11:39.733
>> Yeah, but I didn't tell you

11:39.733 --> 11:40.700
to sit on my head

11:40.700 --> 11:44.533
and restrict my airways.

11:44.533 --> 11:45.367
>> Why were you hiding from us

11:45.367 --> 11:47.067
in the first place?

11:47.067 --> 11:48.633
>> Hey, I'm hiding from everyone

11:48.633 --> 11:49.800
because Halloween's tomorrow

11:49.800 --> 11:50.833
and I know my dad's going

11:50.833 --> 11:52.333
to scare the pudding out of me.

11:52.333 --> 11:53.700
I'm hiding in this trash can.

11:53.700 --> 11:54.467

11:54.467 --> 11:55.200
>> You're too big.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.400
>> Wait. Listen.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.400
Kenzie and I have information

11:59.400 --> 12:00.233
and I think it's going

12:00.233 --> 12:01.700
to make you feel better.

12:01.700 --> 12:02.600
>> Really?

12:02.600 --> 12:03.600
>> Hey.

12:03.600 --> 12:07.933
I have no idea where Trip is.

12:07.933 --> 12:10.633
>> It's over, man.

12:10.633 --> 12:12.433
They see me.

12:20.733 --> 12:21.733
>> Wait.

12:21.733 --> 12:22.533
Why did my dad show up

12:22.533 --> 12:24.067
at your school again?

12:24.067 --> 12:24.867
>> To ask us to help him

12:31.700 --> 12:33.067
you weren't going to help him,

>> We're not really going

12:41.333 --> 12:42.400
to help him.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.200

12:43.200 --> 12:45.067
to think we are, so,

12:45.067 --> 12:48.367
now we can help you scare him.

>> Hey, guys,

12:51.833 --> 12:53.200
we got a problem here.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.567
>> What?

12:54.567 --> 12:56.067
>> This game is really cool,

12:56.067 --> 12:57.333
but it's a total rip off

12:57.333 --> 12:59.200
of our Sky Whale game.

12:59.200 --> 12:59.667
They just

12:59.667 --> 13:02.567
made it all Halloweenie.

13:02.567 --> 13:04.300
>> That is our game.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.433
>> It's our Halloween update

13:05.433 --> 13:07.933
that we posted online.

13:07.933 --> 13:08.900
>> Oh.

13:08.900 --> 13:09.633
Well, we did

how does my dad want you

13:16.067 --> 13:17.733
to help him scare me?

13:17.733 --> 13:20.200
>> Well, it involves a snake.

>> Fast.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.133
>> Let me go, please.

13:35.133 --> 13:36.467

My dad could be anywhere.

13:38.300 --> 13:39.300
Put me down, Hudson.

Stop it.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.133
how your dad's planning

14:00.133 --> 14:01.533
to scare you or not?

14:01.533 --> 14:03.533
>> Yeah, just tell me.

14:03.533 --> 14:05.900
>> Okay, here's Double G's plan.

First, Hudson and I are supposed

to take you to Fooders

14:08.200 --> 14:09.100
to get a snack.

14:09.100 --> 14:09.800
>> What kind of snack?

14:09.800 --> 14:11.633
>> It doesn't matter.

14:11.633 --> 14:12.667
>> Now, after the three

14:12.667 --> 14:13.533
of you leave,

14:13.533 --> 14:14.633
I'm supposed to stay here

14:14.633 --> 14:15.867
and wait for Double G

14:15.867 --> 14:17.067
to show up.

14:17.067 --> 14:17.667
>> Because he's going

14:17.667 --> 14:19.067
to bring the snake.

>> [ screaming ]

>> A very real looking
