HUSBAND'S GUT-SHOT,
BUT HE'S GONNA MAKE IT.

00:39.330 --> 00:42.751
THEY CUT THE GLASS
AROUND THE INSIDE DOOR
TO GAIN ACCESS.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.836
PRETTY FINE JOB
FOR A HOME INVASION.

00:44.919 --> 00:46.171
MAKE A NOTE OF THAT.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.714

00:51.634 --> 00:52.635
HE'LL BE
ALL RIGHT?

00:52.719 --> 00:53.928
HE'S IN SHOCK.
HE SHOULD BE OK LATER.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.055
WE'RE TAKING HIM
TO BELLEVUE.

00:55.138 --> 00:57.432
THAT'LL PUT HIM BACK
IN SHOCK RIGHT THERE.

01:16.659 --> 01:17.994
THERE'S BLOOD
ON THE SHEETS,

01:18.078 --> 01:19.996
BUT THE BLANKETS
ARE PRETTY CLEAN.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.040
NOT TOO MUCH
RANSACKING.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.304
NOTHING REALLY
UNDER HER FINGERNAILS
TO INDICATE A STRUGGLE,

01:36.387 --> 01:38.181
BUT I WANT TO BAG
HER HANDS ANYWAY.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.397
AW, HELL.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.617

03:49.270 --> 03:51.397
WE'RE SORRY TO PRESS
YOU ON THIS,

03:51.481 --> 03:54.400
BUT, YOU KNOW,
ANY INFORMATION THAT
YOU CAN GIVE US RIGHT NOW

03:54.484 --> 03:56.903
MIGHT HELP TO LEAD
TO A QUICK ARREST.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.905
I WANT YOU TO FIND
THE SON OF A BITCH.

04:02.325 --> 04:05.495
ABOUT 5:00 THIS MORNING,
I HEARD SOUNDS...

04:05.662 --> 04:07.747

04:07.956 --> 04:09.499
BUT JOSHIE CRIES AT NIGHT.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.751
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST HIM
RUSTLING THE CRIB.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.504
AND THIS GUY BUSTS IN.
I GET SHOT.

04:14.587 --> 04:18.132
I LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS,
THEN I REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.760
THEN I SAW THE SAME THING
YOU DID.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.764
YOU GET ANY KIND
OF LOOK AT THIS GUY?

04:24.847 --> 04:27.475
HE WORE A MASK. UH...

04:27.558 --> 04:30.561
THE NEIGHBORS, THEY MUST'VE
HEARD OR SEEN SOMETHING.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.606
WE HAVEN'T GOT
ANYTHING YET
OFF OUR CANVASS.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.441
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.987
WELL, UH, OBVIOUSLY,
IF YOU THINK OF
ANYTHING...

05:15.148 --> 05:17.191
WE'RE GONNA LOOK INTO HIM
A LITTLE BIT.

HE'S A FRIEND.

08:27.298 --> 08:31.135
ONE THING I <i>HAVE</i>
LEARNED FROM MY JOB...

08:31.219 --> 08:34.889
IS WHEN SOMEONE'S
CARRYING SOMETHING AROUND
THAT THEY WANT TO SAY,

08:34.972 --> 08:37.558
BUT THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE
GETTING IT OUT.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.021
FIRST THING,
I'M STRAIGHT NOW
10 YEARS.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.356

MYSELF,

08:49.237 --> 08:50.988
BUT I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
FOR A FACT.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.866
GUY THAT DID THE KILLING'S
NAME IS ONUS PRICE.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.994
THE VICTIM WAS RAY GREEN,
A MUSICIAN LIKE ME.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.247
PLAYED BASS AND FRENCH HORN.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.457
ONUS BROKE IN
TO STEAL RAY'S HORN--

09:01.541 --> 09:02.917
IT'S WORTH
A LOT OF MONEY.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.044
HE STOLE THE HORN,
HE SHOT RAY TO DEATH.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.129
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ONUS DID IT?

09:07.213 --> 09:08.089
EVERYBODY KNEW.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.715
ONUS PLAYED A LITTLE,

09:09.799 --> 09:12.385
BUT HE WAS A STONE
JUNKIE--PULLED STICKUPS
WHEN HE WAS SHORT.

09:12.468 --> 09:15.638
RAY CAUGHT HIM
ONCE BEFORE TRYING
TO GET INTO HIS PLACE.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.431

AFTER RAY DIED,

09:17.515 --> 09:20.768

LOADED, SPENDING
ON WOMEN.

SAYING EVERYONE KNEW THAT

IN THAT BUILDING.

HE WENT UPSTAIRS TO DO.

10:11.777 --> 10:14.780
I DIDN'T REALIZE
TILL THEY FOUND RAY.

10:14.864 --> 10:18.284

TOO SCARED TO
SAY ANYTHING.

IN THE BATHROOM.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.526
I WENT IN THERE,
AND IT WAS JUST
HORRIBLE.

11:33.609 --> 11:36.320
HE WAS LYING THERE TWITCHING
WITH HIS HEAD ALL CRUSHED

11:36.404 --> 11:37.988
AND BLOOD
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.324

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.784
YOU'RE JOHN?

11:41.867 --> 11:42.868
I WENT IN THERE BECAUSE
I'M MARGINALLY
COMPULSIVE.

11:42.952 --> 11:43.911
I WASH MY HANDS A LOT.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.538
I NEVER EVEN MET
MR. VOLPER,

11:45.621 --> 11:47.581
AND I ONLY STARTED WORK
HERE 2 DAYS AGO.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.209
JOHN, YOU HAVE NO BLOOD
ON YOU OR SHOW ANY SIGNS
OF A STRUGGLE,

11:50.292 --> 11:51.836
AND I HAVE NO REASON
TO THINK YOU'RE A SUSPECT.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.421
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SAYING THAT.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.256
WHY DON'T YOU WAIT
OVER THERE?

11:55.339 --> 11:58.008
WOULD IT BE ALL RIGHT IF
I WENT TO WASH MY HANDS
REALLY QUICKLY DOWNSTAIRS

11:58.092 --> 11:59.009
AND COME RIGHT BACK UP?

11:59.093 --> 12:00.428
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.265
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE THIS?

12:04.348 --> 12:06.600
ACTUALLY DO IT? NO.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.310
MR. VOLPER WASN'T
TOO POPULAR?

12:08.394 --> 12:10.104
EVEN IF HE WAS A NICE GUY,

12:10.187 --> 12:13.983
YOU'RE ALWAYS DISAPPOINTING
PEOPLE, TURNING THEM DOWN
FOR REPRESENTATION.

12:14.066 --> 12:17.486
PLUS, THE PEOPLE AREN'T
THE MOST NORMAL,
TEND TO ACT OUT.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.572
THE ROCK 'N' ROLL GROUPS?

12:19.655 --> 12:21.282
PLUS ERIK <i>WAS</i>
AN ASSHOLE.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.783

LIKE AN OCCUPATIONAL
REQUIREMENT.

NEED A LIST OF EVERYONE
WHO WORKS HERE, PATTY.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.123

12:29.206 --> 12:31.208
YEAH. I'M GONNA
NEED ALL OF IT.

12:31.292 --> 12:34.044
OK. I'LL GET YOU
ALL OF IT.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.470
LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF
BRAIN MATTER MIXED IN
WITH HIS BLOOD.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.181
WELL, CSU
MIGHT GET A LIFT
OFF THIS DISPENSER.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.974

GET 'EM OVER HERE.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.394
SEE IF THEY GET LIFTS
FROM THAT.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.730
YEAH, MIGHT GET
A MATCH WITH THAT
HERE.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.023
PRETTY GRUESOME,
HUH, DIANE?

12:54.106 --> 12:55.691
OHH, IF YOU'RE
A FAMILY MEMBER,

12:55.775 --> 12:58.152
YOU'D PROBABLY HOPE
THE GUY DOES GO
OUT OF THE PICTURE.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.987
YEAH, SURVIVE,
YOU LIVE AS A BROCCOLI.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.239
LET'S GET THIS
SEALED OFF.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.424
WE REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU COMING IN.

13:20.508 --> 13:24.595
WE'RE VERY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER
AND YOUR GRANDSON.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.682
THEY WERE TAKEN FROM ME
BY MURDER.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.685
ANY IDEAS MIGHT
HELP US LOOK FOR
WHO DID THAT?

13:31.769 --> 13:33.687
ANY GRIEVANCES THAT
ANYONE MIGHT HAVE HAD

13:33.771 --> 13:35.439
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER OR
YOUR DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND?

13:35.523 --> 13:37.191
AGAINST HER HUSBAND, SURE.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.527
A BAD PERSON--

13:39.610 --> 13:40.528
LAZY,

13:40.611 --> 13:41.695
DON'T WANT TO WORK,

13:41.779 --> 13:43.364
BORROWS MONEY.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.658
THAT PERSON'S ALWAYS
GONNA HAVE ENEMIES.

13:45.741 --> 13:46.909
THIS IS
YOUR SON-IN-LAW.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.703
BIG INSURANCE SETTLEMENT
FROM THE BUS COMPANY,

13:49.787 --> 13:50.996
HE SAYS HE'S GONNA GET.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.208
FOR 3 YEARS
HE DON'T DO NOTHING,

13:54.291 --> 13:56.544
JUST SO HE CAN PROVE
HE'S GOT A BAD BACK.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.338
DON'T ASK ME IF
HE'S REALLY HURT.

13:59.421 --> 14:02.383
HE SITS AND PLAYS
QUICK-DRAW ON THE LOTTERY.

14:02.466 --> 14:06.762
DON'T MIND MY TINA
WORKING 2 JOBS.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.681
SO DO YOU KNOW
IF ANYONE SPECIFIC

14:08.764 --> 14:10.891
MIGHT HAVE HAD
A DISAGREEMENT
WITH YOUR SON-IN-LAW,

14:10.975 --> 14:14.061
MAYBE OVER A BAD DEBT,
ANYTHING OF THAT SORT?

14:14.144 --> 14:17.022
MY LITTLE BOY HAD A HOLE
IN HIS HEART.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.400
WHO? WHO'S THIS NOW?

14:19.483 --> 14:21.735
MY GRANDSON
THAT THEY MURDERED.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.738
HE HAD A HOLE
IN HIS HEART.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.283
MY TINA TOOK
SUCH GOOD CARE,

14:27.366 --> 14:29.785
AND I WOULD TAKE
CARE OF HIM.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.204
BUT THAT ONE...

14:32.288 --> 14:34.748
PLAYS QUICK-DRAW
ON THE LOTTERY.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.042
YOUR SON-IN-LAW PAUL?

14:37.126 --> 14:38.711
AND NOW...

14:41.589 --> 14:43.924
SOMEONE MURDERED...

14:44.008 --> 14:45.092
MY DAUGHTER,

14:45.175 --> 14:46.594
MY LITTLE JOSH.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.889
AND THAT ONE DON'T
GET MURDERED?

14:49.972 --> 14:52.057
I PRAYED TO GOD!

14:52.141 --> 14:54.476
PLEASE TAKE MY LIFE...

14:56.186 --> 14:59.356
SO MY LITTLE BOY'S HEART
WOULD BE GOOD.

15:00.482 --> 15:04.069
OH, HE COULD HAVE
TAKEN MY LIFE....

15:04.153 --> 15:07.698
FOR MY DAUGHTER
AND MY GRANDSON
NOT TO BE MURDERED.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.745
[SOBBING]

15:12.828 --> 15:14.204
ALL RIGHT,
MRS. VARGAS.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.626
I HAVE NOTHING NOW.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.963
I DON'T EVEN MIND
COMING HERE.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.840
I HAVE NO PLACE TO GO...

15:24.924 --> 15:27.092
WITH HER AND HIM DEAD.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.083
LIEUTENANT,
CORRECTIONS CALLED

15:59.166 --> 16:00.542
REGARDING AN ONUS PRICE.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.086
THANKS, NAOMI.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.092
IS THAT ONE
BEHAVING HIMSELF?

16:08.175 --> 16:09.593
WELL, HE'S QUITE
UNPLEASANT,

16:09.677 --> 16:11.345
BUT I JUST IMAGINE
HE'S A HOLOGRAM.

16:11.428 --> 16:13.138
TAKE SEATS, AND WE'LL
START THE INTERVIEWS

16:13.222 --> 16:14.598
IN JUST A LITTLE BIT.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.225
WOULD ANYONE
LIKE A BEVERAGE?

16:16.308 --> 16:17.810
SO, WHERE DO YOU
STAND, JAMES?

16:17.893 --> 16:19.561
D.O.A.'S
A MUSICAL MANAGER.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.481
SOMEONE BOUNCED HIS HEAD
OFF THE SINK AND WALLS
IN THE OFFICE BATHROOM.

16:22.564 --> 16:23.649
NO WITNESSES.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.067
WE'LL INTERVIEW
HIS COWORKERS.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.902
HE'S DIVORCED.
EX-WIFE LIVES IN ASPEN.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.320
I'M GONNA CONTACT HER.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.489
YOU GOT A WALK-IN SAYS HE
VANDALIZED THE D.O.A.'S CAR.

16:30.572 --> 16:32.116
I LIKE HIS ATTITUDE.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.534
YOU THINK HE MIGHT
WANT TO THROW IN
A HOMICIDE?

16:33.617 --> 16:34.910
I GOTTA TAKE A CALL.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.413
HEY.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.081
I'M DETECTIVE RUSSELL.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.374
THIS IS
DETECTIVE MARTINEZ.

16:40.457 --> 16:41.500
YEAH? GREAT.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.127
WE WERE TOLD YOU HAVE
INFORMATION

16:43.210 --> 16:44.253
ABOUT A CASE
WE'RE WORKING.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.005
ERIK VOLPER.
I MESSED UP HIS CAR.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.507
WHY DON'T WE TALK
DOWN THE HALL HERE?

16:48.590 --> 16:49.675
GREG.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.929
I ARRIVED HERE
VOLUNTARILY.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.306
ARE WE ALL
ON THE SAME PAGE?

16:56.390 --> 16:57.725
OH, ABSOLUTELY,
NILS.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.810
THAT'S UNDERSTOOD.

16:59.893 --> 17:02.688
I VANDALIZED
THAT DILDO'S CAR,

17:02.771 --> 17:07.192
AND THERE WERE A LOT OF
WITNESSES TO THAT PROBABLY.

17:07.276 --> 17:10.446
AND PROBABLY
A SURVEILLANCE TAPE

17:10.529 --> 17:14.283
IN THEIR "JEW RECORD
EXECUTIVE" PARKING LOT.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.535
SO YOU FIGURE
YOU'RE A SUSPECT

17:16.618 --> 17:19.747
IN THIS OTHER
UNFORTUNATE PART
OF MR. VOLPER'S DAY.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.040
NOW LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.708
IF YOU KNEW THIS ASSHOLE,

17:22.791 --> 17:26.712
YOU WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED
IF SOMEONE PUT HIM
IN A VEG-O-MATIC.

17:26.795 --> 17:29.882
WHEREAS YOU JUST
TOOK A SCREWDRIVER
TO HIS MASERATI.

17:29.965 --> 17:32.092
YEAH, 'CAUSE HE'S
A SICK MANIPULATOR.

17:32.176 --> 17:35.387
HE PRESSES YOUR NOSE
UP AGAINST THE WINDOW

17:35.471 --> 17:36.638
AND THEN...

17:36.722 --> 17:39.058
HITS YOU IN THE BACK
OF THE HEAD.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.851
THE POINT IS,

17:40.934 --> 17:43.520
WHILE WE HAD WORDS
IN HIS OFFICE

17:43.604 --> 17:46.398
AND I DID SOME BODYWORK
ON HIS CAR,

17:46.482 --> 17:49.318
I DID NOT CRACK
HIS SKULL OPEN

17:49.401 --> 17:51.487
IN HIS LAVATORY.

17:51.570 --> 17:55.532
ARE YOU IN THE AID OF
ANY MIND-ENHANCERS
JUST NOW, NILS?

17:55.616 --> 17:56.909
STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION.

17:56.992 --> 17:57.993
OK.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.288
WOULD YOU MIND
PUTTING IT OUT

18:01.371 --> 18:03.832
THAT I <i>AM THE SUSPECT,</i>

18:03.916 --> 18:05.667
EVEN ON
THE PRELIMINARY LIST?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.586
IF WE DO ANY LEAKING
TO THE PRESS,

18:07.669 --> 18:09.880
WE'LL DEFINITELY SAY
YOU HAD A MOTIVE

18:09.963 --> 18:11.965
AND GET YOU
A LITTLE PUBLICITY.

18:12.049 --> 18:15.094
AND SAY THAT
I CONGRATULATE THE KILLER.

18:18.847 --> 18:22.768
DID I INCRIMINATE MYSELF
WITH THE VANDALISM?

18:22.851 --> 18:24.603
Martinez: YOU COULD MAKE
THAT ARGUMENT,

18:24.686 --> 18:26.814
BUT THAT'S NOT THE FOCUS
OF OUR INVESTIGATING.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.107
OK?

18:28.190 --> 18:30.484
OK.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.819
GOOD.

18:31.902 --> 18:32.986
NILS.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.286
HMM.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.247
HYGIENE, DUDE.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.959
THIS ANGELOS' GOT
A GOOD CREDIT RECORD.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.128
THAT'S 'CAUSE HIS WIFE
WORKS 2 JOBS.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.462
HE'S CLEAN WITH BCI.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.047
HE HAD
ALL HIS PHONE BILLS

18:52.131 --> 18:53.507
HIDDEN IN SOME
HALF-ASS LOCKBOX.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.093
12 CALLS IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS
TO THE COTTONTAIL CLUB.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.052
IT'S THIS GIRLIE BAR.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.554
AND 4 MORE CALLS

18:58.637 --> 19:00.764
TO THE DEDICATED LINE
IN THE CLUB'S OFFICE.

19:00.848 --> 19:01.932
YOU WANT TO WAIT ON
TALKING TO ANGELOS AGAIN

19:02.015 --> 19:03.308
UNTIL YOU SEE
IF THAT'S A GIRLFRIEND.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.727
Simone: YEAH. WE'RE
GONNA CHECK IT OUT.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.229
VINCE GOTELLI.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.316
HEY, GENTLEMEN.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.569
NO OFFENSE, VINCE.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.611
THIS MAN
INTRODUCED HIMSELF

19:14.695 --> 19:16.488
AS RETIRED DETECTIVE
VINCE GOTELLI.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.867
NO. VINCE GOTELLI
WAS A LOT SHORTER.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.661
OH, ANDY, STILL
WITH THE JOKES, HUH?

19:22.744 --> 19:24.037
Simone: YOU'RE LOOKING
GOOD THERE, VINCE.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.331
FELLAS, I FINALLY WENT IN
FOR THAT OPEN-HEART SURGERY.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.500
I'M A COMPLETELY NEW MAN.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.419
ALL THAT PRE-OPERATION
AGONIZING

19:30.502 --> 19:31.461
AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS...

19:31.545 --> 19:33.005
I GOTTA TELL YOU
SOMETHING--

19:33.088 --> 19:34.506
IF SOMEONE TOLD YOU THAT
YOU NEED THIS OPERATION

19:34.590 --> 19:37.301
AND YOU'RE SITTING THERE
PUTTING IT OFF, DON'T.

19:37.384 --> 19:41.013
YOU COME OUT WITH ALL
YOUR MENTAL FACULTIES
FUNCTIONING, HUH?

19:41.096 --> 19:42.014
YEAH, WELL,
TRUTH IS, ANDY,

19:42.097 --> 19:43.640
I'M IN A BETTER
FRAME OF MIND.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.517
SO, WHAT BRINGS YOU
IN, VINCE?

19:45.601 --> 19:48.562
WELL, I'M WORKING
CLAIMS INVESTIGATION
FOR VIGILANCE LIFE.

19:48.645 --> 19:50.063
THEY GOT ME LOOKING
INTO THE DEATH

19:50.147 --> 19:51.481
OF THIS TINO ANGELOS.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.900
THEY'LL FILL YOU IN.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.193
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

19:54.276 --> 19:58.405
UH, THAT'S <i>TINA ANGELOS,</i>
VINCE.

19:58.488 --> 19:59.990
D.O.A. WAS A WOMAN.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.783
OH. SO, WHAT
ARE THE ODDS

20:01.867 --> 20:03.869
THAT IT WAS
FOUL PLAY?

20:03.952 --> 20:06.205
DOUBLE HOMICIDE--ALWAYS
A HIGH LIKELIHOOD.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.706
WELL, ANDY, I MEAN,

20:07.789 --> 20:09.917
DO YOU THINK
THAT MAYBE IT WAS
AN INSURANCE WHACK?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.128
WELL, WHAT KIND OF POLICY
DID THE COMPANY WRITE THERE?

20:13.212 --> 20:14.338
THE GUY...

20:14.421 --> 20:18.300
CARRIED A 1.4 MILLION
TERM ON HIMSELF

20:18.383 --> 20:19.509
AND A MILLION ON THE WIFE.

20:19.593 --> 20:20.886
ON HIM, WE COULD
UNDERSTAND,

20:20.969 --> 20:22.804
BECAUSE HE HAS
A BIG CLAIM OUT
AGAINST THE CITY.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.057
BUT THE WIFE SEEMS
POTENTIALLY STINKY.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.434
SO THIS GUY FIGHTS
THROUGH HIS GRIEF
FROM A HOSPITAL BED

20:27.517 --> 20:29.228
FILING FOR HIS WIFE'S
BENEFITS.

20:29.311 --> 20:32.397
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
THE POINT OF ORIGIN
OF THE PHONE CALL.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.566
WE GOTTA GO CHECK OUT
A GIRLIE BAR, VINCE.

20:34.650 --> 20:37.236
YOUR CLAIMANT MAY HAVE
HAD A BACKDOOR SQUEEZE.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.154
GIVE HIM A MOTIVE
TO TAKE OUT HIS WIFE.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.448
WELL, UH, WHICH GIRLIE BAR
YOU GOING TO?

20:41.531 --> 20:42.908
THE COTTONTAIL CLUB.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.577
YOU EVER FREQUENT
THAT HUTCH?

20:52.125 --> 20:54.253
[LOUD MUSIC PLAYING]

21:05.681 --> 21:07.766
WHERE'S THE OWNER?

21:07.849 --> 21:09.268
HUH? WHERE'S THE OWNER?

21:09.351 --> 21:11.270
LET ME TELL HER
SOMEONE'S HERE.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.607
WHAT DID HE
JUST ASK YOU?

21:20.362 --> 21:22.614
THANK YOU.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.543
NEW YORK CITY
DETECTIVES.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.753
PLEASE. COME IN.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.464
SORRY I'M NOT
COMMITTING
ANY CRIME.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.049
WELL, IF WE APPLIED
OURSELVES THERE, SHAUNA,

21:41.133 --> 21:43.051
I BET WE COULD
DRUM SOMETHING UP.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.096
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

21:46.179 --> 21:47.597
LIVE VIDEO
ON THE INTERNET.

21:47.681 --> 21:49.308
YOU GOT
ANY EXPERIENCE?

21:49.391 --> 21:50.726
HEY, BE NICE.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.311
WHAT'S PAUL ANGELOS
TALK ABOUT

21:52.394 --> 21:54.563
ALL THOSE TIMES
HE CALLS YOU?

21:54.646 --> 21:56.481
WHAT HAPPENED?

21:56.565 --> 21:57.649
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENED, SHAUNA?

21:57.733 --> 21:59.067
YOU ASSIST PAUL

21:59.151 --> 22:00.777
RUBBING UP HIS CHUBBY,
SHAUNA? HMM?

22:00.861 --> 22:02.321
YOU COME
INTO INFORMATION

22:02.404 --> 22:05.115
BUILDING UP A DEEP
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP

22:05.198 --> 22:06.575
WOUND UP USEFUL
IN A HOME INVASION?

22:06.658 --> 22:09.911
HEY! YOU STOP POINTING
THAT THING AT ME.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.789
I WASN'T INVOLVED
IN NO HOME INVASION
OR NOTHING ELSE.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.167
ANGELOS' WIFE AND SON
ARE DEAD.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.378
AND WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH HIM?

22:18.462 --> 22:20.547
ALL HIS HEROIC EFFORTS
TO SAVE HIS FAMILY,

22:20.630 --> 22:23.342
MIRACULOUSLY, HE ONLY
INCURRED NOT TOO BAD
OF A BULLET WOUND.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.510
HEY! WHAT
DID I TELL YOU?

22:25.594 --> 22:26.803
YOU KEEP TALKING.

22:31.641 --> 22:33.101
WASN'T INVOLVED.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.146
SHAUNA, YOU THINK
YOUR PLACE OUTSIDE
COULD STAND A TOSS, TOO?

22:36.229 --> 22:38.148
WHAT, AM I BEING
UNCOOPERATIVE?

22:38.231 --> 22:40.817
I DON'T HEAR ANY BIG
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION
COMING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.361
HE'S GOT
AN INVOLVEMENT WITH ME,

22:42.444 --> 22:46.114
AND HE'S TALKED ABOUT,
YOU KNOW,

22:46.198 --> 22:49.242
HE COULD POSSIBLY CHANGE
HIS, UH...LIFESTYLE.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.119
THAT HIS FAMILY SITUATION
MIGHT CHANGE?

22:51.203 --> 22:52.371
IN GENERAL TERMS.

22:52.454 --> 22:56.083
AND I NEVER
PAID ATTENTION,
ENCOURAGED IT.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.918
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH NO MURDERS.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.629
AT LEAST I GOT THEM
TO SIT DOWN.

23:00.712 --> 23:04.049
DID ANGELOS EVER TALK
TO ANY OF YOUR CLIENTELE

23:04.132 --> 23:05.133
YOU THINK WERE WRONG GUYS?

23:05.217 --> 23:07.052
GIVING UP A NAME,

23:07.135 --> 23:08.845
AM I ACCESSORIZING
MYSELF?

23:08.929 --> 23:10.639
NO.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.641
FRAN WATKINS.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.559
I KNOW FOR A FACT
HE'S GOT A RECORD,

23:14.643 --> 23:18.063
AND ABOUT 10 DAYS AGO,
HE WAS SHOWING A GUN OFF

23:18.146 --> 23:19.564
WHICH I
THREW HIM OUT FOR.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.233
HE'S STAYING
AT THE WORTH.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.776
TWO OF THE GIRLS PARTIED
WITH HIM THERE
LAST WEEK.

23:22.859 --> 23:24.319
AND YOU SEEN HIM
WITH PAUL?

23:24.403 --> 23:26.863
LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS,
I SEEN PAUL WITH HIM
A LOT.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.993
PAUL GOT SOME
SPECIAL SCENE?

23:32.077 --> 23:33.495
YOU MEAN, LIKE,
OTHERWISE,

23:33.578 --> 23:35.080
WHY WOULD HE BE
HANGING OUT
WITH ME?

23:35.163 --> 23:36.581
YEAH.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.333
HE'S GOT
A SPECIALTY.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.835
WHICH IS WHAT?

23:39.918 --> 23:41.753
HE LIKES
GETTING WET.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.422
GETTING URINATED ON.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.006
AND YOU DO THAT
FOR HIM?

23:45.090 --> 23:47.300
WHY NOT, RIGHT? HUH?

23:47.384 --> 23:49.511
SAVES YOU A TRIP
TO THE CAN.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.847
RESUME DANCING.

24:24.337 --> 24:25.755
I'M NOT ABOUT TO ARGUE

24:25.839 --> 24:27.674
THERE'S JUSTICE
IN THE WORLD, HARVEY,

24:27.757 --> 24:30.093
BUT ONUS PRICE
IS IN THE SYSTEM.

24:32.679 --> 24:35.474
WHAT DID THEY
GET HIM FOR?

24:35.557 --> 24:37.476
HE WAS STOPPED
IN AN UNREGISTERED CAR

24:37.559 --> 24:39.436
HOLDING 80 GRAMS
OF HEROIN.

24:39.519 --> 24:41.146
HE ALSO HAD A .25
THAT WAS USED

24:41.229 --> 24:43.607
IN A LIQUOR STORE
STICKUP IN QUEENS.

24:43.690 --> 24:46.359
THE D.A.'S NOT SURE
THEY CAN GO TO BAT
ON THE LIQUOR STORE,

24:46.443 --> 24:47.986
BUT THE 80 GRAMS
IS FELONY WEIGHT.

24:48.069 --> 24:50.405
AND PRICE HAS
2 DRUG PRIORS,

24:50.489 --> 24:51.948
SO, BEHIND
THE ROCKEFELLER LAW,

24:52.032 --> 24:54.242
HE'S LOOKING
AT 15 YEARS IN JAIL.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.120
I WANT HIM TO ADMIT
HE KILLED RAY.

24:57.204 --> 24:58.955
I DON'T KNOW WHY
HE'D DO THAT, HARVEY.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.040
THEN I'LL KNOW FOR A FACT
WHAT I DONE.

25:00.123 --> 25:02.000
I HELPED A MAN
KILLED MY FRIEND

25:02.083 --> 25:03.585
GET AWAY FROM THE SCENE.

25:03.668 --> 25:06.254
DIDN'T HAVE NERVE
TO CALL HIM TO ACCOUNT.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.714
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I DONE

25:07.797 --> 25:10.967
SO I...KNOW WHAT
I GOT TO ANSWER FOR.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.220
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY LEVERAGE, HARVEY.

25:15.805 --> 25:17.265
LOOK...

25:17.349 --> 25:19.768
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO UNDERSTAND THAT

25:19.851 --> 25:21.228
BEFORE
I TALK TO HIM.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.648
THANKS, ARTHUR.

25:24.731 --> 25:25.899
YEAH.

25:28.902 --> 25:31.029
WHERE WERE YOU AT 5:00
THIS MORNING, HUH, FRAN?

25:31.112 --> 25:34.991
AT AN AFTER-HOURS CLUB
UP ON AMSTERDAM.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.993
YEAH? WHICH ONE
WAS THAT?

25:37.077 --> 25:38.370
TOO DRUNK TO REMEMBER.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.580
YOU WEREN'T ON
RIVINGTON STREET
AROUND THAT TIME?

25:40.664 --> 25:42.999
UPTOWN. AMSTERDAM AVENUE.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.001
THERE WAS A MULTIPLE
HOMICIDE LAST NIGHT

25:45.085 --> 25:46.294
ON RIVINGTON STREET,

25:46.378 --> 25:47.754
A HOME INVASION.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.256
A MAN WAS SHOT,

25:49.339 --> 25:51.299
HIS WIFE AND HIS
YEAR-OLD-BOY
WERE KILLED.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.260
WOW.

25:59.516 --> 26:03.311
YOU FREQUENT
THE COTTONTAIL
CLUB, FRAN?

26:03.395 --> 26:04.980
PERIODICALLY.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.231
YOU KNOW
A PAUL ANGELOS?

26:06.314 --> 26:07.983
WHY, HE DANCE THERE?

26:08.066 --> 26:10.777
HEY. A WOMAN AND
A ONE-YEAR-OLD BOY.

26:11.861 --> 26:13.613
SORRY.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.035
WHAT WAS HIS NAME AGAIN?

26:19.119 --> 26:20.662
PAUL ANGELOS.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.083
YEAH, IT'S A POSSIBILITY.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.877
WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE?

26:27.961 --> 26:30.005
YOU NEVER DID
NO BUSINESS WITH HIM?

26:30.088 --> 26:32.048
BUSINESS?

26:32.132 --> 26:33.258
NO.

26:33.341 --> 26:35.218
WHAT BUSINESS IS HE IN?

26:35.302 --> 26:38.054
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE
WITH THESE MORONS?

26:38.138 --> 26:40.015
ONE STEP OUT
OF THE TREES,

26:40.098 --> 26:42.058
THEY GOT A "WORLD
BY THE BALLS"
ATTITUDE.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.727
MEANWHILE,
25 FEET AWAY,

26:43.810 --> 26:45.437
THEY'RE GETTING
SENT TO JAIL
FOR LIFE.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.398
YOU STAY COCKY,
YOU DOUCHE BAG.

26:48.481 --> 26:50.150
THIS ANGELOS
THAT HIRED YOU,

26:50.233 --> 26:51.526
HE'S GIVING YOU UP.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.403
HEY. NOBODY HIRED ME
TO DO NOTHIN'.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.155
HE'S PICKING YOU
OUT OF MUG BOOKS.

26:55.238 --> 26:56.740
HE'S SAYING
YOU BROKE IN,

26:56.823 --> 26:57.907
SHOT HIM.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.159
HE DID HIS BEST
TO FIGHT YOU OFF.

26:59.242 --> 27:01.703
BUT YOU STICK WITH
THAT WISENHEIMER LOOK

27:01.786 --> 27:03.330
AND "NOBODY HAD ME
DO NOTHIN'."

27:03.413 --> 27:05.081
YOU WANT TO THINK
ABOUT IT A LITTLE, FRAN?

27:05.165 --> 27:06.291
YEAH, GO ON,
THINK ABOUT IT.

27:06.374 --> 27:07.709
WE'LL HAVE SOMEONE
COME IN

27:07.792 --> 27:09.210
WITH A BUCKET
OF WATER

27:09.294 --> 27:11.713
IN CASE YOU IGNITE
FROM EXERTING
YOUR BRAIN.

27:25.685 --> 27:27.020
YES, MA'AM.

27:28.271 --> 27:29.189
HEY, LIEU.

27:29.272 --> 27:30.607
YOU GETTING
ANYWHERE?

27:30.690 --> 27:33.526
SO FAR, IT'S JUST
DIFFERENT VERSIONS
THE GUY WAS A CREEP,

27:33.610 --> 27:36.196
BUT WE GOT MORE INTERVIEWS
COMING IN THE REST
OF THE AFTERNOON.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.198
EX-WIFE SAYS SHE MOVED
2,000 MILES AWAY

27:38.281 --> 27:39.866
SO SHE WOULDN'T KILL HIM.

27:39.949 --> 27:40.867
COHEN.

27:40.950 --> 27:42.702
THANKS
FOR COMING IN.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.121
FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS
IN THAT RED-HOT GREEN CASE?

27:45.205 --> 27:46.623
I WANT YOU TO WATCH
THIS INTERVIEW.

27:46.706 --> 27:47.957
IT'S A HOMICIDE
FROM THE EARLY DAYS

27:48.041 --> 27:49.209
OF THE REAGAN
ADMINISTRATION.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.669
20 YEARS FROM NOW,

27:50.752 --> 27:53.046
WE MAY STILL BE
WORKING ON THIS ONE.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.224
SO, THIS ABOUT RUNS
THE STRING OUT,

28:04.307 --> 28:05.558
HUH, ONUS?

28:05.642 --> 28:07.727
IS THAT SO?

28:11.648 --> 28:13.608
A-FELONY WEIGHT,

28:13.692 --> 28:14.734
YOUR SHEET.

28:14.818 --> 28:17.862
YOU TELL ME.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.364
STRANGE SYSTEM.

28:19.447 --> 28:21.491
YOU NEVER KNOW HOW
THINGS FALL OUT.

28:21.574 --> 28:24.119
SO, ONUS, YOU'RE FRIENDS
WITH HARVEY BOUTIER.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.578
WE AIN'T TIGHT.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.455
HIS NAME CAME UP
ON A MURDER

28:27.539 --> 28:28.998
15 YEARS AGO.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.625
GUY NAMED RAY GREEN.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.377
YEAH, I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT IT.

28:32.460 --> 28:33.712
YOU DON'T?

28:33.795 --> 28:36.256
15 YEARS IS A LONG TIME.

28:36.339 --> 28:39.092
YOU HELP US WITH
THE GREEN HOMICIDE,

28:39.175 --> 28:41.720
MAYBE YOU GET HELP
ON THIS WEIGHT
YOU WERE HOLDING.

28:41.803 --> 28:44.013
WHAT YOU THINK
BOUTIER DID?

28:44.097 --> 28:45.890
YOU TELL ME.

28:47.892 --> 28:49.310
THEY WAS MUSICIANS.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.645
HE HAD BUSINESS
WITH GREEN.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.605
ASKED IF I'D DRIVE HIM
TO GREEN'S PLACE.

28:52.689 --> 28:53.732
THAT'S ALL I KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.066
YOU DID DRIVE HIM?

28:55.150 --> 28:56.276
DROVE HIM THERE
AND WAITED.

28:56.359 --> 28:57.944
DID YOU KNOW GREEN
WAS MURDERED?

28:58.027 --> 29:01.281
I KNEW HE TURNED UP DEAD.

29:02.615 --> 29:05.452
THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU
ON THAT ONE.

29:05.535 --> 29:07.871
GET ME SOME RHYTHM
BEHIND THIS TROUBLE HERE,

29:07.954 --> 29:10.498
I'LL PUT THAT ALL
IN A STATEMENT.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.292
ALL RIGHT.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.676
CAN HE GO BACK
TO THE TOMBS?

29:21.760 --> 29:22.844
YEAH.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.056
Detective:
STAND UP.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.310
PUTTING HIMSELF
AT THE SCENE

29:30.393 --> 29:31.770
IS AS MUCH
AS YOU'RE GOING TO GET.

29:31.853 --> 29:35.315
IT'S HARD TO GET
SOMEBODY TO DEAL UP TO
A MURDER.

29:35.398 --> 29:37.233
I UNDERSTAND.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.903
I OUGHT TO GIVE
MY STATEMENT NOW.

29:39.986 --> 29:42.071
ALL RIGHT.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.414
VINCE?

29:51.498 --> 29:53.333
I'LL BE A FEW MINUTES.

29:53.416 --> 29:55.251
A HEART PATIENT,
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO STRAIN

29:55.335 --> 29:56.753
MOVING YOUR BOWELS.

29:56.836 --> 29:58.254
ARE WE OK WITH ANGELOS?

29:58.338 --> 29:59.672
HE AGREED TO TAKE
THE POLYGRAPH.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.800
HE'S COMING
RIGHT FROM THE HOSPITAL.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.343
WE BETTER MOVE THAT FRAN
UP TO THE CRIB.

30:03.426 --> 30:06.763
TELL JILL SHE'S GOT TO
IMPERSONATE AN EXAMINER.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.223
FEELS GOOD,

30:08.306 --> 30:11.684
US ALL PULLING TOGETHER
AGAIN LIKE THIS.

30:22.278 --> 30:24.239
I'M VINCENT C. GOTELLI
SPEAKING,

30:24.322 --> 30:26.074
CLAIMS ASSOCIATE
FOR VIGILANCE LIFE,

30:26.157 --> 30:28.034
PRESENT WITH
MR. PAUL ANGELOS,

30:28.117 --> 30:31.496
BENEFICIARY OF
POLICY CG79485,

30:31.579 --> 30:35.959
WRITTEN ON THE LIFE
OF MRS. TINA ANGELOS, DECEASED.

30:36.042 --> 30:38.169
MR. ANGELOS HAS REQUESTED
EXPEDITED SETTLEMENT

30:38.253 --> 30:41.172
AND HAS AGREED
TO A POLYGRAPH
WHILE GIVING HIS ACCOUNT

30:41.256 --> 30:44.175
OF THE MURDER
OF HIS WIFE AND SON.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.845
ALSO PRESENT
ARE DETECTIVE BOBBY SIMONE

30:46.928 --> 30:48.304
AND ANDY SIPOWICZ,

30:48.388 --> 30:51.391
AND POLYGRAPH EXAMINER
JILL HARDSTONE.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.727
OK...

30:54.811 --> 30:55.854
IS THAT TOO TIGHT?

30:55.937 --> 30:56.938
NO, IT'S FINE.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.439
SO EVERYONE'S
ON THE SAME PAGE,

30:58.523 --> 31:00.859
I'M GOING TO TELL
IN MY OWN WORDS
WHAT HAPPENED.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.736
Gotelli: CORRECT.
SHE'LL JUST ASK
UNCONNECTED QUESTIONS

31:03.820 --> 31:05.071
TO ESTABLISH A BASELINE.

31:05.154 --> 31:07.073
ALL RIGHT.

31:07.156 --> 31:09.659
IS YOUR NAME PAUL ANGELOS?

31:09.742 --> 31:11.703
YES, IT IS.

31:11.786 --> 31:14.372
ARE YOU A CITIZEN
OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA?

31:14.455 --> 31:15.373
NATURALIZED.

31:15.456 --> 31:16.416
YES,

31:16.499 --> 31:18.376
I AM.

31:22.463 --> 31:24.299
I WAS SLEEPING
IN OUR APARTMENT

31:24.382 --> 31:25.967
WHEN I, UH, HEARD
RUSTLING SOUNDS,

31:26.050 --> 31:28.386
WHICH I ASSUMED
WAS MY SON,

31:28.469 --> 31:31.180
WHO'S AN INVALID
WITH HEART PROBLEMS.
HE DOESN'T SLEEP WELL.

31:31.264 --> 31:34.642
AT A CERTAIN POINT,
I BECAME AWARE
OF A FLASHLIGHT.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.436
I REALIZED
THERE WAS AN INTRUDER.

31:36.519 --> 31:38.021
I GOT UP FROM THE BED
TO INTERVENE,

31:38.104 --> 31:39.856
I WAS STRUCK ON THE HEAD,

31:39.939 --> 31:41.900
AND I RECALL VAGUELY
A SHARP PAIN IN THE STOMACH,

31:41.983 --> 31:44.861
WHICH I ASSUMED SUBSEQUENTLY
IS WHEN I WAS SHOT.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.367
WHEN I REGAINED
CONSCIOUSNESS,

31:51.451 --> 31:55.622
I SAW THAT MY WIFE AND SON
HAD BEEN EXECUTED

31:55.705 --> 31:57.332
AND I'D BEEN SHOT
IN THE STOMACH.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.334
I THINK I LAPSED
INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS
ONE MORE TIME

31:59.417 --> 32:01.252
WHEN I WAS ON THE PHONE
WITH 911.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.463
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S ON THE RECORDING.

32:03.546 --> 32:06.424
THAT'S MY FULL RECOLLECTION.

32:20.688 --> 32:23.650
ALL RIGHT, LET HER GET
ANOTHER BASELINE.

32:28.446 --> 32:32.033
DO YOU SOLICIT AND PAY FOR
BEING URINATED ON?

32:34.786 --> 32:38.665
SHE'S ASKING,
DID YOU PAY SHAUNA MILLS
TO PISS ON YOU?

32:39.916 --> 32:41.960
ALL RIGHT, TAKE THESE OFF.
THIS STATEMENT IS OVER.

32:42.043 --> 32:45.088
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD
THE PLEASURE
IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

32:45.171 --> 32:46.756
FRAN WATKINS
PISS ON YOU, TOO?

32:46.839 --> 32:48.466
NONE OF THIS IS ENFORCEABLE
IN A COURT OF LAW.

32:48.549 --> 32:50.718
THE POLYGRAPH IS INADMISSIBLE.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.096
ABSOLUTELY, PAUL.
POLYGRAPHS ARE DEFINITELY
INADMISSIBLE.

32:53.179 --> 32:55.515
OF COURSE,
WE DO GOT FRAN WATKINS
IN THE NEXT ROOM,

32:55.598 --> 32:59.268
AND HE ALREADY
GIVE YOU UP HIRING HIM
TO DO THE MURDERS.

32:59.352 --> 33:02.855
I WAS JUST ASKING
FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION
ABOUT THE PISSIN'.

33:02.939 --> 33:05.149
WE NEVER GOT AROUND
TO ASKING HIM THAT.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.734
I ATTEMPTED TO STOP
THOSE MURDERS.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.152
SURE YOU DID, PAUL.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.363
YOU HIRED HIM TO DO
THOSE KILLINGS

33:10.446 --> 33:12.323
AND THEN YOU TRIED
TO STOP IT.

33:12.407 --> 33:13.533
THAT'S RIGHT.

33:13.616 --> 33:15.952
AND IF HE SAYS
ANYTHING ELSE, HE'S LYING.

33:16.035 --> 33:18.037
TINA WAS SCREAMING.
MY BOY WAS SCREAMING.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.622
I TRIED TO STOP HIM.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.292
I SWEAR THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

33:29.048 --> 33:31.092
THEN THAT'S WHAT
YOU'D BETTER WRITE.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.396
I WANT TO TELL

33:43.479 --> 33:45.982
MY PART IN KILLING

33:46.065 --> 33:47.608
RAY GREEN.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.819
I THINK RATHER THAN
IDENTIFYING YOURSELF
AS A PARTICIPANT,

33:49.902 --> 33:52.613
WHAT YOU
MEAN TO DESCRIBE
ARE YOUR ACTIVITIES

33:52.697 --> 33:54.824
AT THE TIME,
LEADING UP TO
AND FOLLOWING

33:54.907 --> 33:56.325
RAY GREEN'S DEATH.

33:56.409 --> 33:57.577
[CLEARS THROAT]

33:57.660 --> 34:00.204
DESCRIBE IT
THE WAY YOU WANT,
MR. BOUTIER.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.417
ONUS PRICE ASKED ME
TO DRIVE THE CAR

34:04.500 --> 34:05.918
AFTER HE TOOK RAY OFF,

34:06.002 --> 34:11.674
AND I DIDN'T ASK HIM
WHAT WAS IN
THE DUFFEL BAG...

34:11.758 --> 34:13.676
WHICH WAS RAY'S HORN.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.846
JUST TO BE CLEAR,
DID YOU ACTUALLY SEE
MR. GREEN'S TRUMPET?

34:16.929 --> 34:18.514
I KNEW WHAT WAS IN THE BAG.

34:18.598 --> 34:21.017
AND AFTER I GOT OUT
OF THE CAR

34:21.100 --> 34:22.685
AND WALKED AROUND,

34:22.769 --> 34:24.687
I KNEW WHAT MUST HAVE
HAPPENED.

34:24.771 --> 34:26.439
AT LEAST RAY
MUST HAVE BEEN HURT,

34:26.522 --> 34:28.733
'CAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY
RAY WOULD GIVE UP HIS HORN.

34:28.816 --> 34:30.234
YOU'RE DESCRIBING
A TIME NOW

34:30.318 --> 34:32.820
AFTER YOU'D GOTTEN OUT
OF ONUS PRICE'S CAR

34:32.904 --> 34:35.198
AND FOLLOWING
WHAT YOU INFER WAS PRICE

34:35.281 --> 34:37.200
HAVING ROBBED RAY GREEN?

34:37.283 --> 34:39.577
YEAH, WHEN THEY FOUND RAY...

34:39.660 --> 34:41.079
THE NEXT DAY,

34:41.162 --> 34:43.831
I WAS SICK TO HEART.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.418
AND ONUS FOUND ME
THAT NIGHT AT THE PINE.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.462
THIS IS THE PINE GRILL.

34:49.545 --> 34:52.882
AND ONUS SAID IT WAS BAD
WHAT HAPPENED TO RAY.

34:52.965 --> 34:55.218
IT WAS A BAD THING
AND AWFUL,

34:55.301 --> 34:57.303
AND I KNEW WHAT HE WAS
SAYING TO ME,

34:57.386 --> 35:00.139
AND I HAD NO NERVE
TO GO UP AGAINST HIM,

35:00.223 --> 35:03.643
TO...OPEN MY MOUTH...

35:03.726 --> 35:07.396
WHAT ONUS...DONE.

35:10.316 --> 35:11.901
AND THAT'S
THE FULL EXTENT
OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE

35:11.984 --> 35:13.194
OF THE INCIDENT?

35:13.277 --> 35:15.113
AND 'CAUSE I NEVER SAID,

35:15.196 --> 35:18.157
4 YEARS LATER RAY'S SISTER
CAME UP FROM GEORGIA,

35:18.241 --> 35:22.203
AND I...AVOIDED
BEING FRIENDS WITH HER.

35:22.286 --> 35:26.040
AND BEHIND NOT SAYING,
I SEE RAY'S NEPHEW,

35:26.124 --> 35:30.086
AND...I COULDN'T BE FRIENDS
WITH HIM.

35:30.169 --> 35:32.880
AND I'D SEE THAT DAMN

35:32.964 --> 35:35.925
SON OF A BITCH ONUS

35:36.008 --> 35:37.426
RUNNING A GAME

35:37.510 --> 35:38.928
OR LOOKING
TO TAKE SOMEBODY OFF,

35:39.011 --> 35:43.099
AND SOMETIMES
HE'D LAY EYES ON ME...

35:43.182 --> 35:44.767
AND I'D...

35:44.851 --> 35:47.353
TURN AWAY.

35:47.436 --> 35:51.899
SO IT WASN'T DRIVING NO CAR
FOR ONUS 15 YEARS AGO

35:51.983 --> 35:54.485
OR NOT KNOWING FOR SURE

35:54.569 --> 35:57.780
WHAT WAS IN
THAT DUFFEL BAG.

35:57.864 --> 36:00.783
DIFFERENT WAYS
I STAYED ON

36:00.867 --> 36:03.244
KILLING RAY...

36:03.327 --> 36:05.580
ALL THIS TIME.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.586
DO YOU WANT TO SAY
ANYTHING FURTHER,
MR. BOUTIER?

36:11.669 --> 36:14.255
NO, THAT'S IT.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.720
I'LL MAKE SURE
PRICE IS CHARGED
FOR THE HOMICIDE.

36:20.803 --> 36:22.597
I DON'T KNOW THAT
THEY'LL GO TO BAT,

36:22.680 --> 36:23.973
BECAUSE HE'S
A REPEAT OFFENDER,

36:24.056 --> 36:26.934
AND HE'S
DEAD TO RIGHTS
ON THESE DRUG FELONIES.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.561
BUT, UH, I PROMISE
HE'LL BE CHARGED.

36:28.644 --> 36:31.647
AND IF THEY HAVE TO CHARGE ME,
I'M READY FOR THAT.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.858
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
THAT'S NOT LIKELY,
MR. BOUTIER.

36:33.941 --> 36:36.736
WE APPRECIATE
YOUR COOPERATION.

36:37.904 --> 36:40.281
I WISH IT DIDN'T TAKE DYING

36:40.364 --> 36:42.074
TO GIVE ME NERVE.

36:48.414 --> 36:52.168
SO, UH, YOU HAVE TO BE
AT THE DIALYSIS UNIT BY 4:00?

36:52.251 --> 36:54.295
I'M GONNA PLAY HOOKY.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.090
GIVE ME A RIDE HOME?

36:59.258 --> 37:00.593
YEAH, SURE.

37:27.662 --> 37:28.913
APPRECIATE YOU COMING IN.

37:28.996 --> 37:30.122
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.374
DANA
IS YOUR FIRST NAME?

37:31.457 --> 37:32.875
UH--UH--DANA LENNIX.

37:32.959 --> 37:36.003
I KNOW IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE
A WOMAN'S NAME.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.463
OH, NO,
NOT NECESSARILY.

37:37.546 --> 37:40.049
ANYWAY, DANA,
WITH THE INCIDENT
THIS MORNING,

37:40.132 --> 37:42.093
WE'RE TALKING TO
ANYONE IN THE BUILDING

37:42.176 --> 37:43.928
WHO MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GIVE US INFORMATION.

37:44.011 --> 37:46.472
UH...I MAINTAINED
THAT BATHROOM
AT 6:25 THIS MORNING.

37:46.555 --> 37:49.558
THAT'S MY SCHEDULED TIME,
AND TODAY I WAS ON TIME.

37:49.642 --> 37:51.560
SOME DAYS I'LL BE
A FEW MINUTES BEHIND,

37:51.644 --> 37:53.688
BUT TODAY
I WAS RIGHT ON TIME.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.274
YOU DIDN'T
NOTICE ANYTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY?

37:56.357 --> 37:57.275
NO.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.902
DID YOU KNOW
MR. VOLPER AT ALL?

37:59.986 --> 38:01.404
WELL, JUST AS A PERSON.

38:01.487 --> 38:03.739
HE...HE WORKED
ON THAT FLOOR.

38:03.823 --> 38:05.074
WELL, BEING CANDID, DANA,

38:05.157 --> 38:07.034
UH, PEOPLE WE'RE TALKING TO,

38:07.118 --> 38:11.205
THIS MR. VOLPER'S
NOT COMING OUT WINNING
ANY POPULARITY CONTESTS.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.249
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO THAT.

38:13.332 --> 38:16.502
AS FAR AS
YOUR DEALINGS WITH HIM,
ANY UNPLEASANT CONVERSATION?

38:16.585 --> 38:17.628
NOTHING OF THAT SORT?

38:17.712 --> 38:19.088
I JUST KNEW HIM
AS A PERSON.

38:19.171 --> 38:21.507
DID HE EVER COME EARLY
TO WORK?

38:21.590 --> 38:23.050
OH, HE'D COME IN EARLY.

38:23.134 --> 38:26.137
HE'D BE IN ALL HOURS,
YOU KNOW, IN AND OUT.

38:26.220 --> 38:30.016
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE IN
A HOSPITAL, DANA?

38:33.436 --> 38:34.979
14 MONTHS.

38:35.062 --> 38:37.940
AND WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

38:38.024 --> 38:40.443
UH...IT WAS A MEDICAL
PROBLEM.

38:40.526 --> 38:41.944
WHAT KIND?
DO YOU REMEMBER?

38:42.028 --> 38:43.863
UH...IT WAS
A MEDICAL DIFFICULTY.

38:43.946 --> 38:46.115
WERE YOU GIVEN
MEDICATION FOR THAT?

38:46.198 --> 38:47.616
TURNED OUT
IT WASN'T NECESSARY.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.118
THEY DIDN'T GIVE YOU
MEDICATION,

38:49.201 --> 38:51.120
OR IT TURNED OUT
YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT?

38:51.203 --> 38:52.496
UH, TH-THE SECOND.

38:52.580 --> 38:56.125
HOW LONG SINCE
YOU DIDN'T TAKE
YOUR MEDICATION, DANA?

38:56.208 --> 38:58.961
SAY, UH, 4 MONTHS.

39:02.381 --> 39:04.216
SO, THAT'S ABOUT IT.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.634
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

39:05.718 --> 39:07.803
THAT'S ABOUT IT,
SO I'M READY TO GO.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.680
WELL, WE GOTTA COMPLETE
OUR INTERVIEW, DANA,

39:09.764 --> 39:11.640
COMPLETE
OUR INFORMATION.

39:11.724 --> 39:15.436
WELL, WHAT YOU DON'T WANT
IS ME LOSING MY TEMPER.

39:15.519 --> 39:16.979
WELL, NO ONE WANTS THAT,

39:17.063 --> 39:19.231
BUT WE NEED TO COMPLETE
OUR INTERVIEW.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.650
UH...DON'T GET
UNDER MY SKIN.

39:22.985 --> 39:25.654
YOU HAVE PROBLEMS
WITH YOUR TEMPER, DANA?

39:25.738 --> 39:27.740
I DIDN'T HURT ANYBODY.

39:27.823 --> 39:30.451
DID YOU HURT ERIK VOLPER
THIS MORNING?

39:32.411 --> 39:36.832
DANA, IF THAT'S
YOUR BLOODY FINGERPRINT
ON THE BATHROOM WALL,

39:36.916 --> 39:40.503
ONCE THOSE LAB REPORTS
GET BACK, I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN HELP YOU.

39:40.586 --> 39:42.671
I CAN'T HELP YOU, EITHER.

39:44.090 --> 39:47.885
DO YOU WANT
TO HOLD MY HAND
WHILE WE TALK ABOUT THIS?

39:56.602 --> 39:59.355
SOMEONE PULLED OUT
THE TOWEL TOO HARD,

39:59.438 --> 40:01.023
BROKE THAT WHOLE THING
AGAIN.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.817
THIS HAPPENED
IN FRONT OF YOU?

40:02.900 --> 40:04.068
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

40:04.151 --> 40:07.863
I EXPLAINED HOW TO
CORRECTLY REMOVE THE TOWEL,

40:07.947 --> 40:11.700
HE CALLED ME AN IDIOT
AND A MORON

40:11.784 --> 40:14.495
AND A TOILET JOCKEY.

40:14.578 --> 40:17.498
I NEVER RAISED MY VOICE
TO LOSE MY TEMPER,

40:17.581 --> 40:18.833
AND PROVING THAT IS

40:18.916 --> 40:20.376
NO ONE HEARD NOTHING,

40:20.459 --> 40:22.753
AND THIS IS 8:14
WHEN THERE WAS SEVERAL PEOPLE

40:22.837 --> 40:24.171
ALREADY TO WORK.

40:27.842 --> 40:30.386
I BROKE HIS HEAD
AGAINST THAT SINK.

40:31.804 --> 40:35.891
MIGHT HAVE BEEN INVISIBLE
EXITING THAT STATION 4.

40:35.975 --> 40:38.394
THAT'S THAT LAVATORY,
STATION 4?

40:38.477 --> 40:40.396
MIGHT AS WELL
HAVE BEEN INVISIBLE.

40:40.479 --> 40:43.566
DON'T GET UNDER MY SKIN.

40:43.649 --> 40:47.236
AND DON'T DIS--
I'LL BREAK YOUR HANDS
OFF YOUR WRISTS!

40:47.319 --> 40:48.404
I--

40:48.487 --> 40:49.738
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY!

40:49.822 --> 40:51.574
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

40:51.657 --> 40:53.075
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

41:20.686 --> 41:22.605
[OUT OF BREATH]

41:22.688 --> 41:25.649
GET YOURSELF SOMETHING
FROM THE ICEBOX,
ARTHUR.

41:25.733 --> 41:30.154
I GOT VEGETABLE JUICES
IN THERE
MAKE A HEALTHY MAN SICK.

41:30.237 --> 41:32.156
I'M ALL RIGHT.

41:32.239 --> 41:35.451
WISH I HAD SOME BEER
TO OFFER YOU
OR SOMETHING.

41:35.534 --> 41:36.994
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
HARVEY.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.040
IF I HAD IT,
I'D DRINK IT.

41:41.123 --> 41:42.958
[CHUCKLES]

41:43.042 --> 41:46.545
SO, IS THIS
LIKE A SNAPSHOT?

41:48.881 --> 41:51.675
I'M SORRY OUR LIVES
DIDN'T CROSS MORE, HARVEY.

41:51.759 --> 41:54.303
I ALWAYS LIKED YOU.

41:54.386 --> 41:57.431
ADMIRED HOW MUCH
YOU LOVED YOUR MUSIC.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.142
I WISH IT HAD
COME TO MORE.

42:01.310 --> 42:03.229
YOU HATE THINKING
THAT...

42:03.312 --> 42:06.690
MAYBE YOU WERE JUST
A FOOL FOR IT.

42:06.774 --> 42:09.693
BEING A FOOL FOR SOMETHING'S
NOT ALL BAD.

42:11.570 --> 42:15.074
YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU AIN'T BEEN
FOOLISH ENOUGH, ARTHUR?

42:16.742 --> 42:18.827
I FEEL THAT WAY SOMETIMES.

42:21.247 --> 42:23.165
I LOVE MY FAMILY.

42:23.249 --> 42:25.626
I THINK
I'M A GOOD FATHER,

42:25.709 --> 42:27.127
A GOOD HUSBAND.

42:27.211 --> 42:30.130
I'M PROUD I'VE MADE
SOME PROGRESS ON MY JOB.

42:30.214 --> 42:31.674
AND KNOWING YOU,

42:31.757 --> 42:34.635
THAT COMES MORE FROM
PICKIN' IN THE FIELD

42:34.718 --> 42:38.180
THAN DUSTING OFF
THE PLANTATION HOUSE
PIANO.

42:38.264 --> 42:40.683
SOMETIMES AT NIGHT
I LAY UP,

42:40.766 --> 42:44.311
AND IF THERE'S A WIND,
IT SOUNDS LIKE MY LIFE
RUSHING BY.

42:45.771 --> 42:48.774
I WONDER IF THERE WAS A FIGHT
I WAS SUPPOSED TO FIGHT

42:48.857 --> 42:51.110
BUT DIDN'T LOOK RIGHT
TO SEE IT,

42:51.193 --> 42:53.779
OR...IF THERE WAS A WAY

42:53.862 --> 42:57.241
I SHOULD HAVE LET
LILLIAN AND MY KIDS
KNOW I LOVED THEM

42:57.324 --> 42:59.702
WOULD HAVE WARMED THEM
IN THEIR HEARTS

42:59.785 --> 43:01.620
NO MATTER WHAT COLD CAME.

43:03.998 --> 43:07.501
I WONDER IF I JUST WASN'T
FOOL ENOUGH TO TRY.

43:07.585 --> 43:10.337
YOU TRIED FOR ME
TODAY, ARTHUR.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.090
AND I KNEW

43:13.173 --> 43:15.217
YOU WERE WHO I...

43:15.301 --> 43:18.220
SHOULD COME TO.

43:18.304 --> 43:21.890
I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH GOOD I DID.

43:21.974 --> 43:24.977
SEEMS THEY DON'T LET YOU
BE SURE OF THAT, EITHER.

43:28.147 --> 43:29.481
WELL...

43:35.988 --> 43:37.364
IF YOU WANT COMPANY,
HARVEY,

43:37.448 --> 43:39.408
YOU KNOW WHERE
TO FIND ME

43:39.491 --> 43:40.909
AND HOW TO CALL.

43:40.993 --> 43:41.869
YEAH.

43:41.952 --> 43:44.163
I DO KNOW THAT MUCH.

43:45.247 --> 43:47.791
COUNTS FOR A LOT.
