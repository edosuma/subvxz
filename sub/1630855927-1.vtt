WEBVTT

00:53.011 --> 00:53.887
Anything?

00:53.887 --> 00:55.264
No.

00:55.264 --> 00:57.891
Huh, I don't get why
it's not working yet.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.518
Okay, read it off again.

00:59.518 --> 01:04.231
Oh, here we go.

01:04.231 --> 01:06.817
Did we calibrate the rear glass?

01:06.817 --> 01:08.068
Yes.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.655
35 millimeter camera
attachment secured?

01:12.823 --> 01:13.615
Definitely.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.576
Took the lens cap off?

01:17.578 --> 01:19.663
Yeah, of course we
took the lens cap off.

01:19.663 --> 01:20.956
What do you think we are?

01:20.956 --> 01:22.541
But I think I do
know what's wrong.

01:22.541 --> 01:25.419
Maybe we just need a
little Kipler elbow rub.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.588
What's a Kipler elbow rub?

01:27.588 --> 01:28.964
Observe, my son.

01:28.964 --> 01:31.925
Okay, so my father taught me
this and now I'm teaching you.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.510
So you take your elbow,

01:33.510 --> 01:36.722
and you just rub at the
problem area, right?

01:36.722 --> 01:37.514
Pay attention to the elbow.

01:37.514 --> 01:38.807
You paying attention?

01:38.807 --> 01:39.808
Yup.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.602
All the action
is in the elbow.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.729
And you snap (snapping
fingers) and that should do it.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.022
Take another look.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.608
It's working.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.068
Yeah,
Kipler elbow rub.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.945
No sign of the comet, though.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.114
Hey, patience, okay?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.699
Jesper's Comet
has been traveling

01:55.699 --> 01:57.784
almost 10 years to get here.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.036
It'll get here.

02:00.162 --> 02:00.954
Hey.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.123
Listen, kiddo.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.416
There's actually something

02:04.416 --> 02:05.876
I've been meaning to
talk to you about.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.921
So your mom and I-

02:08.921 --> 02:11.215
Whose car is that?

02:11.215 --> 02:12.424
Oh, okay.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.342
Stay here.

02:13.342 --> 02:14.801
I'll be right back, 'kay?

02:14.801 --> 02:16.220
But the comet!

02:16.220 --> 02:17.137
30 Seconds.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.013
Start the countdown, 'kay?

02:19.097 --> 02:21.850
30, 29

02:21.850 --> 02:24.895
28, 27.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.068
Dad, it's here!

02:32.027 --> 02:33.111
Dad!

02:36.949 --> 02:37.824
Mom! Dad!

02:45.791 --> 02:46.917
Oh.

02:49.002 --> 02:49.795
Oh, come on.

02:54.550 --> 02:55.342
Calvin!

03:03.642 --> 03:05.018
Mom?

03:06.854 --> 03:07.646
Calvin!

03:24.079 --> 03:24.997

04:18.258 --> 04:19.510
Again?

04:19.510 --> 04:20.719
We just stopped
like 30 minutes ago.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.221
Okay, well I need to go again.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.889
Maybe you have a UTI.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.182
You know, they make you urinate

04:25.182 --> 04:27.142
two to three times
more than usual.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.019
Evan, I don't have a UTI.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.270
We're only about 20
minutes from our new house.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.063
Can you wait?

04:31.063 --> 04:32.689
No, I cannot wait.

04:32.689 --> 04:36.276
Definitely sounds like
a urinary tract infection.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.027
Okay.

04:39.071 --> 04:42.074
Looks like there's a convenience
store .2 miles up the road.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.283
Maybe we can all grab
a snack while Itsy

04:43.283 --> 04:44.618
flushes out her system.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.703
How do you even know
how to use this thing?

04:46.703 --> 04:48.497
And this map is probably
outdated anyway.

04:48.497 --> 04:49.540
I see it!

04:49.540 --> 04:51.041
Good job, kiddo.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.001
It's called orienteering, sis.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.211
Might be worth looking into

04:54.211 --> 04:57.297
now that the big city's
bye-bye. Forever.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.090

anything good to shoot

06:14.041 --> 06:15.751
in Puddle Falls anyways.

06:15.751 --> 06:18.003
It's Pebble Falls,
and I see what you mean.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.756
These are the best
that I managed.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.762
Too bad.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.347
All aboard.

06:28.347 --> 06:29.515
Let's go kids.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.476
Let's get to that house.

06:32.476 --> 06:35.354
Maybe we can check out
those bathrooms, too.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.197
Oh my gosh.

06:45.197 --> 06:45.989
There we go.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.616
There it is!

06:47.616 --> 06:48.367
Looks even bigger
than it did on Craigslist.

06:48.367 --> 06:49.952
You guys.

06:49.952 --> 06:54.039
Hey, Itsy, got
your weed-pulling hands ready?

06:54.039 --> 06:56.959
Pull some cactus too, maybe.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.335
Look at that.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.253
There's a jackrabbit.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.045
Dibs!

07:00.045 --> 07:01.004
I dibsed it.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.464
It's mine.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.341
It's perfect!

07:04.341 --> 07:06.093
It's a real fixer-upper.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.636
Just like Chip and Joanna.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.137
Yep.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.181
Pretty great
view from up here!

07:11.181 --> 07:12.099
Oh my gosh!

07:12.099 --> 07:13.892
Evan get down from there!

07:13.892 --> 07:15.811
How's
the roof look, bud?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.564
Pretty great shape, I'd say!

07:18.564 --> 07:19.940
Oh, we're lucky.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.151
Everyone says a good roof is
critical to a nice, easy flip.

07:24.403 --> 07:25.529
I'd like to give
you a nice, easy flip.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.239
Honey!

07:27.239 --> 07:28.198
This roof feels solid.

07:30.409 --> 07:31.994
Evan?

07:31.994 --> 07:33.078
Where are you?

07:33.078 --> 07:34.454
I'm in my room.

07:34.454 --> 07:38.417
I think we're gonna have
to replace the insulation.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.085
Hey, Its, why don't
you take a picture of us

07:40.085 --> 07:41.837
in front of the house?

07:41.837 --> 07:43.797
Evan, it's picture time!

07:49.970 --> 07:51.513
Ah, there he is.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.473
Okay, ready?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.851
Everyone say, dream home.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.853
Dream home!

08:01.398 --> 08:02.691
Oh.

08:03.984 --> 08:07.196
I guess we'll have to
adopt the countryside's

08:07.196 --> 08:08.697
open-door policy.

08:09.948 --> 08:13.035
Oh, I get it.

08:13.035 --> 08:14.494
Oh my gosh, Its,
did you hear that?

08:18.498 --> 08:21.168
Somebody save me.

08:42.648 --> 08:44.024
Itsy!

08:45.442 --> 08:46.193
Coming.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.405
Hey, sweetheart, can you
run over to the neighbors

08:50.405 --> 08:52.241
and ask to borrow a hammer?

08:52.241 --> 08:53.575
And maybe a screwdriver.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.786
And some duct tape,
and a handful of screws.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.371
Heck, a spare door
if they've got one.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.874
Why can't we just go
to the hardware store?

09:00.874 --> 09:03.252
Uh, well, the hardware
store's about two hours away

09:03.252 --> 09:06.296
and we still have to unpack,
and do all that stuff.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.965
It'll be good for us
to meet the neighbors.

09:07.965 --> 09:09.883
And by us, you mean me, right?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.009
Uh, no.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.470
I mean you and Lewis and Clark.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.890
Orienteering.

09:16.890 --> 09:17.808
Remember?

09:17.808 --> 09:19.017
Remember the maps and stuff?

09:19.017 --> 09:20.686
Yeah, I remember.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.982
Have fun.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.066
We've been walking
for 10 minutes

09:26.066 --> 09:27.985
and I haven't seen
a single neighbor.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.820
A single human neighbor.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.698
We've seen prairie
dogs, gophers,

09:32.698 --> 09:34.116
sparrows, and grasshoppers-

09:34.116 --> 09:36.410
I'm gonna die out here!

09:36.410 --> 09:37.202
Hey, look.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.453
There's a neighbor.

09:40.622 --> 09:44.168
Looks like the road
curves up and around.

09:44.168 --> 09:45.502
Oh, offroading.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.546
I'm right behind ya.

09:47.546 --> 09:50.924
Another common neighbor is
the prairie rattlesnake,

09:50.924 --> 09:52.676
who will not
hesitate to bite you-

09:52.676 --> 09:53.927
Shut up, Evan.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.848
Let's go to this house.

10:19.870 --> 10:20.621
Hello.

10:21.872 --> 10:22.915
I think there's
someone back here.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.377
You know, on second thought,

10:27.377 --> 10:29.880
tomorrow might be a better
day for an adventure.

10:29.880 --> 10:30.923
I thought you
liked adventuring.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.299
Let's go.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.091
Come on, Itsy.

10:33.091 --> 10:33.884
I just wanna go home.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.469
Evan, it's fine.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.722
I've got a bad feeling
about this place.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.098
Evan, I thought you
wanted to come out here.

10:40.098 --> 10:40.891
I just don't want...

10:50.943 --> 10:51.985
I think there's
someone in there.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.028
Oh, really?

10:53.028 --> 10:54.488
What gave that away?

10:54.488 --> 10:56.573
The mysterious noises, or
the blood-curdling scream?

10:56.573 --> 10:58.659
Okay, Ev, can you just
help me open the door?

10:58.659 --> 10:59.785
Hard pass.

10:59.785 --> 11:00.702
Evan!

11:07.042 --> 11:08.418
Okay, can we go now?

11:08.418 --> 11:09.211
No.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.046
What does that say?

11:11.046 --> 11:12.381
Unidentified flying object-

11:13.298 --> 11:13.966
Intruder alert!

11:15.133 --> 11:16.134
No, let go of me!

11:16.134 --> 11:17.719
Save yourself!

11:18.512 --> 11:19.972
Okay, let's go!

11:21.265 --> 11:23.809
It smelled of dust,
talcum powder, and danger.

11:23.809 --> 11:25.853
But I had to know
what was in that shed.

11:25.853 --> 11:26.854
You were terrified.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.188
Of course.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.274
But what is bravery but
courage in the face of fear?

11:30.274 --> 11:32.776
So I pulled open that
40-pound hinged door-

11:32.776 --> 11:34.736
We pulled open.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.114
I pulled open that
40-pound hinged door

11:37.114 --> 11:39.741
and single-handedly battled
that masked villain.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.829
And then I shouted,
"Save yourself, Itsy.

11:43.829 --> 11:44.872
"I'll save you."

11:44.872 --> 11:45.664
Good job, kiddo.

11:45.664 --> 11:46.790
Then I grabbed him.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.917
I'm sure it was real scary.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.711
I'll check it out.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.171
I'm gonna die here, Mom.

11:52.171 --> 11:53.380
Die.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.007
I'll have your
father go check it out,

11:55.007 --> 11:57.134
I'm sure the neighbors were
just in the middle of something.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.468
That's not what I mean.

11:58.468 --> 11:59.928
I have to get back to the city.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.013
There's nothing here for me.

12:01.013 --> 12:03.140
Nothing but
possibilities, you mean.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.725
You can do whatever
you want here.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.018
You should take the extra room

12:06.018 --> 12:07.978
and turn it into a darkroom
for your photographs.

12:07.978 --> 12:08.979
That'll be fun.

12:08.979 --> 12:09.980
I can't stay here.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.649
And the second I
graduate, I'm gone.

12:12.649 --> 12:13.942
Uh huh.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.068
With what money?

12:16.486 --> 12:18.113
Scholarship money.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.281
Oh, I like the sound of that.

12:19.281 --> 12:20.908
Does that mean you're
gonna study more?

12:20.908 --> 12:21.909
No!

12:23.118 --> 12:24.286
You're not going to die, Itsy.

12:24.286 --> 12:25.579
I am.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.664
Things are gonna
get better soon.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.790
Soon is a relative term.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.459
I need you to be more specific.

12:30.459 --> 12:31.752
Hm, tomorrow.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.087
What's tomorrow?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.339
First day of school.

12:35.339 --> 12:37.799
I am not going
to school tomorrow.

12:37.799 --> 12:40.844
Have fun
at school, guys.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.095
Shall we?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.472
You're not in high school.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.224
Pebble Falls is K through 12,

12:45.224 --> 12:47.476
and that includes me, baby.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.271
Okay.

13:05.369 --> 13:09.998
Micah Merrill, please
report to the front desk.

13:13.085 --> 13:15.295
Is something funny?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.964
Oh, not at all.

13:16.964 --> 13:21.927
We're just wondering if you're
sure you wanted to sit there.

13:23.095 --> 13:25.472
You're welcome to
come sit with us.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.599
By the looks of things,
it's gonna take a little bit

13:27.599 --> 13:31.770
for you to make friends,
but I'm happy to help out.

13:31.770 --> 13:32.521
For now.

13:35.148 --> 13:39.653
You know, you guys seem
really cool, but I'm good here.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.988
Suit yourself.

13:40.988 --> 13:44.408
How was everybody's weekend?

13:44.408 --> 13:47.911
I said, how was
everybody's weekend?

13:49.621 --> 13:50.581
Good.

13:50.581 --> 13:51.957
Who said that?

13:53.917 --> 13:56.420
Oh, you must be one
of our new students.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.713
Would you like to stand up

13:57.713 --> 14:00.382
and tell us a little
about yourself?

14:04.511 --> 14:08.182
Um, my
name is Itsy Levan.

14:08.182 --> 14:08.932
I'm 17.

14:10.642 --> 14:11.977
My dream job

14:11.977 --> 14:13.187
is to work at the "New York
Times" as a journalist.

14:13.187 --> 14:14.438
No, no, no, no, no.

14:14.438 --> 14:16.190
That's too "new kid at school."

14:16.190 --> 14:17.566
Just tell us your name

14:17.566 --> 14:20.360
and three things you
think are cheujy,

14:20.360 --> 14:22.446
and what cheujy means.

14:22.446 --> 14:23.614
You mean cheugy?

14:26.158 --> 14:28.285
Mr. Kipler, if you
can't use the doorknob

14:28.285 --> 14:31.163
like everyone else, you need
to remove whatever apparatus

14:31.163 --> 14:33.582
is preventing you from doing so.

14:33.582 --> 14:35.709
It's not an
apparatus, Mr. Sterman,

14:35.709 --> 14:37.628
it's my gravity
equilibrium suit.

14:37.628 --> 14:38.921
I need to acclimate.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.923
Do they not have
doorknobs in space?

14:41.965 --> 14:43.800
Calvin, get your butt in here!

14:43.800 --> 14:46.220
Okay, okay, hold on.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.311
Glad you could make it.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.939
I'm sure the commute from the
stratosphere was terrible.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.232
You mean the exosphere?

14:58.232 --> 14:59.691
The stratosphere is the
layer right above us.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.443
Nothing orbits in
the stratosphere.

15:01.443 --> 15:02.694
What is that smell?

15:02.694 --> 15:04.780
Oh it's uh, coconut
oil and squid ink.

15:04.780 --> 15:06.114
A natural lubricant

15:06.114 --> 15:07.699
for me to slip in and
out of my spacesuits.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.243
Just take a seat, Mr. Kipler.

15:09.243 --> 15:09.993
Okay.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.497
Still happy with
your seat choice?

15:14.414 --> 15:15.707
Oh, whoops, sorry.

15:15.707 --> 15:16.500
Eww!

15:16.500 --> 15:17.251
Oh, eww!

15:18.961 --> 15:20.879
So
today is the 11th.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.381
So you know what that means?

15:22.381 --> 15:24.550
That's right, it's
group activity day.

15:24.550 --> 15:27.094
Yeah, yeah, you
expressive radical.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.428
Get it?

15:28.428 --> 15:31.056
Little mathematics
joke for you guys.

15:32.808 --> 15:36.186
Anywho, since you all didn't
like that last scenario-

15:36.186 --> 15:38.981
How did you find
my command center?

15:38.981 --> 15:39.940
Hmm?

15:39.940 --> 15:42.734
That was you outside
my shed, right?

15:42.734 --> 15:44.903
You hit my arm with a stick.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.530
Oh, yeah!

15:46.530 --> 15:47.823
Sorry, me and my brother

15:47.823 --> 15:49.950
were just looking
for a screwdriver.

15:49.950 --> 15:50.826
And a door.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.412
So what was going on in there?

15:53.412 --> 15:55.414
Uh, it's top secret for
anyone who isn't a friendly.

15:55.414 --> 15:57.875
Well, I come in peace.

15:57.875 --> 15:59.001
How do you know about that?

15:59.001 --> 15:59.918
About what?

15:59.918 --> 16:01.879
The galactic sign for peace.

16:01.879 --> 16:03.172
I mean, I'm glad that I
can trust someone else

16:03.172 --> 16:06.383
on this planet, but where'd
you learn about that?

16:06.383 --> 16:08.844
From "Star Trek?"

16:08.844 --> 16:11.096
What trek, and to what star?

16:11.096 --> 16:12.723
All
right, everyone.

16:12.723 --> 16:14.766
You and the person sitting
next to you have 15 minutes

16:14.766 --> 16:17.019
to figure out how
long it takes a ship

16:17.019 --> 16:19.980
traveling at the speed of
light to get to Jupiter.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.190
Go!

16:21.190 --> 16:25.068
Okay, so it says
that the speed of light

16:25.068 --> 16:27.362
is one billion, eighty
million kilometers an hour-

16:27.362 --> 16:28.280
Wrong.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.698
It is one billion,

16:29.698 --> 16:31.658
seventy nine million
kilometers per hour, actually.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.576
But the teacher-

16:32.576 --> 16:34.077
Is a adequate math teacher,

16:34.077 --> 16:35.329
however, he is woefully ignorant

16:35.329 --> 16:37.372
when it comes to
interstellar travel.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.208
Oh, what, and
you're an expert?

16:39.208 --> 16:41.251
As a matter of fact, I am.

16:41.251 --> 16:44.087
Okay, well then you
can figure this one out.

16:44.087 --> 16:45.631
All right.

16:45.631 --> 16:47.466
Well, first we have to adjust
the size of the vessel.

16:47.466 --> 16:48.258
We do?

16:48.258 --> 16:49.551
Well, yeah.

16:49.551 --> 16:50.844
Any spacecraft traveling
at the speed of light

16:50.844 --> 16:52.262
it has to be at
least 1/3 the size

16:52.262 --> 16:55.015
of today's clunky,
120-meter rocketships.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.935
So like, what, 50 meters?

16:59.102 --> 16:59.853
40.

17:01.522 --> 17:03.398
You can calculate space
travel but not fractions?

17:03.398 --> 17:05.567
Fractions will be obsolete
within the next 100 years.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.986
So, what day will it be leaving?

17:07.986 --> 17:08.987
I don't know.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.072
Why does that matter?

17:10.072 --> 17:11.698
Because depending
on the time of year,

17:11.698 --> 17:15.744
Jupiter will obviously be in
a different orbital position.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.746
Yes?

17:17.746 --> 17:18.997
What day is the
spacecraft leaving?

17:18.997 --> 17:19.915
Why does that matter?

17:21.667 --> 17:22.960
Okay, yeah.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.336
Because depending
on the time of year,

17:24.336 --> 17:27.506
Jupiter will obviously be in
a different orbital position.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.049
Huh, that's a great point.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.926
Let's say tomorrow.

17:30.926 --> 17:32.594
So if we were
leaving tomorrow,

17:32.594 --> 17:35.681
it would be about 900 million
kilometers away from Jupiter.

17:35.681 --> 17:36.974
But the board says 1,200.

17:36.974 --> 17:37.891
Wrong again.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.226
Our spacecraft will be traveling

17:39.226 --> 17:40.894
to Jupiter's future location,
so the curved flight path

17:40.894 --> 17:42.604
will be 1.4 times longer.

17:42.604 --> 17:45.482
We would get there in about
an hour and 15 minutes.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.192
How do you know all this?

17:47.192 --> 17:48.819
Just common sense, really.

17:48.819 --> 17:53.282
If it was common sense,
I would know it, too.

17:53.282 --> 17:57.786
You know, maybe you should
go on more "Star Treks."

18:01.874 --> 18:03.000
I'm Heather.

18:04.543 --> 18:05.878
I'm Itsy.

18:05.878 --> 18:07.171
I know.

18:07.171 --> 18:09.423
I feel really good about
us being besties now.

18:09.423 --> 18:11.383
Especially 'cause I was the
lead in this years' play,

18:11.383 --> 18:13.969
"My Fair Ladybug" and I'm also
running for class president,

18:13.969 --> 18:16.305
which everyone says I've
already got in the bag.

18:16.305 --> 18:19.099
So I'm just a really
good person to know.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.684
Anyway, I'm also the head editor

18:20.684 --> 18:22.019
for our Young Journalists Club,

18:22.019 --> 18:24.062
and I wanted to
invite you to enter

18:24.062 --> 18:26.899
into a writing competition
for NYU with me.

18:26.899 --> 18:28.942
The winners get to go to
their summer writing program.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.903
Oh my gosh, that's awesome.

18:30.903 --> 18:32.154
So where's this program?

18:32.154 --> 18:33.739
Right in New York City, baby.

18:33.739 --> 18:36.033
That's amazing; I'm in.

18:36.033 --> 18:37.409
So what's the subject about?

18:37.409 --> 18:39.453
The prompt is to write
about the strangest thing

18:39.453 --> 18:40.954
in your hometown.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.206
Oh, well I just moved here,

18:42.206 --> 18:43.790
so I don't know much
about Pebble Falls,

18:43.790 --> 18:44.875
but I'm sure I
can figure it out.

18:44.875 --> 18:48.003
Oh, no, I've already
figured that part out.

18:48.003 --> 18:51.715
The problem is because of a
certain incident in 2nd grade

18:51.715 --> 18:55.219
involving a fairy tea party
and a mock alien invasion,

18:55.219 --> 18:57.971
I'm unable to do the research
on the perfect subject.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.098
But that's where you come in.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.308
I'm still confused.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.601
What's the subject?

19:02.601 --> 19:04.895
Not so much a what, but a who.

19:04.895 --> 19:05.979
Anyone here that cares
about the future of the world?

19:05.979 --> 19:09.566
I'm raising money to
go to outer space.

19:09.566 --> 19:11.818
So, I'm actually
gonna be streaming it.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.403
Anybody that wants
to see the stream?

19:14.947 --> 19:16.782
Hey, could you spare some
money for my grandma's surgery?

19:16.782 --> 19:18.534
Just kidding, it's
way cooler than that.

19:18.534 --> 19:19.993
It's for outer space.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.203
No?

19:21.203 --> 19:22.538
You want me to
write about that guy?

19:22.538 --> 19:23.830
The requirements
are to write about

19:23.830 --> 19:25.207
the strangest thing
in your hometown.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.042
That is definitely
Calvin Kipler.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.794
Obviously, he's not
gonna open up to me,

19:28.794 --> 19:31.296
but if you and I work
to write this thing,

19:31.296 --> 19:33.590
we'll be in New York
City in no time.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.801
Hey guys, I need to
acclimate this suit.

19:35.801 --> 19:36.844
I can't take it off.

19:37.636 --> 19:39.221
Ooh, my nunchucks.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.973
Unless, you want to stay
in Pebble Falls forever.

19:40.973 --> 19:42.975
No, no, definitely not.

19:42.975 --> 19:45.143
So what do you think I
should do to get started?

19:45.143 --> 19:47.020
You're a journalist, right?

19:47.020 --> 19:48.230
You'll figure it out.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.523
Bye.

19:49.523 --> 19:51.108
Let me
hear you say, "Hey,"

19:51.108 --> 19:51.984
if you wanna give me some
money for outer space.

19:51.984 --> 19:53.026
Hey.

19:53.026 --> 19:53.777
Who said that?

19:58.240 --> 19:59.491
Whoops, sorry.

19:59.491 --> 20:00.325
Didn't realize anybody
was sitting here.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.703
No, you can stay.

20:02.703 --> 20:04.913
But don't you wanna sit here?

20:04.913 --> 20:06.957
Yeah, with you.

20:06.957 --> 20:07.958
Sit.

20:11.086 --> 20:15.048
So, you live in Pebble Falls?

20:15.048 --> 20:16.133
Mm hm.

20:16.133 --> 20:18.051
I guess that was
a dumb question.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.387
Um, how long have
you lived here for?

20:20.387 --> 20:22.306
Uh, 207 months.

20:22.306 --> 20:24.933
Or 103 weeks and two days.

20:25.893 --> 20:27.895
I like the accuracy.

20:29.855 --> 20:32.107
Where did you come up with that?

20:32.107 --> 20:33.025
A sandwich?

20:33.025 --> 20:35.360
No, like, the Doritos
on the sandwich?

20:36.653 --> 20:38.197
Oh, garnish.

20:38.197 --> 20:38.906
It's cool.

20:40.657 --> 20:41.950
What's the town like?

20:41.950 --> 20:45.746
It's an adequate
place of residence.

20:49.041 --> 20:50.876
What are you doing?

20:52.711 --> 20:54.171
Okay, that's gross.

20:54.171 --> 20:54.963
No, it's not.

20:54.963 --> 20:55.923
Here, try one.

20:55.923 --> 20:58.008
No, maybe another time.

20:59.343 --> 21:01.803
So I actually wanted to
talk to you about something.

21:01.803 --> 21:03.639
Something supernatural.

21:06.016 --> 21:06.767
Go on.

21:08.060 --> 21:12.439
So late last night I was
walking in front of my house,

21:12.439 --> 21:14.900
and I was listening to some
music on my headphones-

21:14.900 --> 21:16.527
What kind of headphones?

21:16.527 --> 21:18.278
I don't know, that's not
important to the story-

21:18.278 --> 21:21.448
Everything is
important to the story.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.824
Marshall cans.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.410
What song?

21:25.410 --> 21:26.286
Elton John.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.246
What song?

21:28.705 --> 21:29.831
"Tiny Dancer."

21:31.083 --> 21:33.293
So I was listening
to "Tiny Dancer"

21:33.293 --> 21:34.920
on my Marshall headphones,

21:34.920 --> 21:37.464
when all of a sudden
the music cuts out.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.800
And then I look up
and the street lamps,

21:39.800 --> 21:41.760
they're flashing, going crazy.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.054
And then all the
sudden they just stop.

21:44.054 --> 21:46.890
Yeah, and then
everything goes quiet.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.685
The crickets and the birds,
everything just stops.

21:49.685 --> 21:52.062
And then right above me
this series of lights

21:52.062 --> 21:55.566
starts flashing, and
it's like red and white,

21:55.566 --> 21:57.442
and then splashes of blue.

21:57.442 --> 22:00.445
Then as soon as it arrived,
it just disappeared.

22:00.445 --> 22:01.280
It just went whoosh.

22:01.280 --> 22:01.989
It was gone.

22:01.989 --> 22:03.532
Then what?

22:03.532 --> 22:07.077
Then everything
went back to normal.

22:07.077 --> 22:08.954
So what's your take on it?

22:08.954 --> 22:10.414
I know what that is.

22:10.414 --> 22:13.083
Sounds like what you
encountered is a Super Galaxy.

22:13.083 --> 22:14.168
A Super Galaxy?

22:14.168 --> 22:16.753
Is that some sort
of alien technology?

22:16.753 --> 22:18.589
A celestial disturbance?

22:18.589 --> 22:20.340
An intersection
between our world

22:20.340 --> 22:22.843
and another parallel universe?

22:22.843 --> 22:24.011
Nope.

22:24.011 --> 22:25.137
A Lockheed C-5 Super Galaxy

22:25.137 --> 22:27.681
is a large military
transport aircraft.

22:27.681 --> 22:28.724
Wait, what?

22:29.725 --> 22:30.684
That's rude.

22:32.352 --> 22:34.479
But the crickets went silent.

22:34.479 --> 22:36.148
Crickets go silent when
anything gets too close.

22:36.148 --> 22:37.608
I know, this was different

22:37.608 --> 22:39.610
because the lights
were flickering.

22:39.610 --> 22:41.361
Super Galaxies are equipped
with a frequency jammer

22:41.361 --> 22:43.197
that's similar to what the
old sodium-vapor streetlights

22:43.197 --> 22:44.198
work off of.

22:44.198 --> 22:45.782
They need to be replaced.

22:45.782 --> 22:47.576
I've gone to the city council
about this several times,

22:47.576 --> 22:50.162
and they're always like,
"Ooh, those work just fine,"

22:50.162 --> 22:51.872
and "Oh, we don't
have the budget,"

22:51.872 --> 22:54.541
or "Uh, don't stand on the
podium," blah, blah, blah.

22:54.541 --> 22:59.421
Okay, but then how do you
explain the sequence of notes?

22:59.421 --> 23:00.547
Sequence of notes?

23:00.547 --> 23:01.548
Did I not tell you?

23:01.548 --> 23:02.883
When the lights were flashing,

23:02.883 --> 23:04.968
there was a sequence of
notes that was playing.

23:04.968 --> 23:05.969
Twice.

23:07.095 --> 23:10.098
Can you remember these notes?

23:10.098 --> 23:11.350
Yeah, probably.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.647
Very well.

23:16.647 --> 23:18.065
I have a piano in my workshop.

23:18.065 --> 23:20.526
Meet me in the parking lot
10 minutes after the bell.

23:20.526 --> 23:21.276
Okay.

23:23.362 --> 23:25.030
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

23:35.123 --> 23:36.250
You ready?

23:36.250 --> 23:37.376
Evan, what are you doing here?

23:37.376 --> 23:38.961
What do you mean?

23:38.961 --> 23:40.128
This is where Mom and
Dad told us to meet them.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.129
Okay, well, I'm
not going home.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.172
I have stuff to do.

23:42.172 --> 23:43.340
What kind of stuff?

23:43.340 --> 23:44.591
Secret stuff.

23:44.591 --> 23:45.926
What kind of secret stuff?

23:52.641 --> 23:53.392
Wow.

23:56.061 --> 23:59.773
Crap; Evan, just don't
say anything embarrassing.

24:01.692 --> 24:02.818
All right, you ready to go?

24:02.818 --> 24:03.610
Holy moly!

24:03.610 --> 24:05.988
This is incredible!

24:05.988 --> 24:07.030
Wait, sorry.

24:07.030 --> 24:07.823
Who is this?

24:07.823 --> 24:08.866
Evan Lean.

24:10.117 --> 24:12.035
So your name is spelled
Evan, and then an L,

24:12.035 --> 24:13.537
and another Evan?

24:14.413 --> 24:15.998
I think you're my hero.

24:18.166 --> 24:18.959
Hey, kids.

24:18.959 --> 24:20.627
Hey, hop in.

24:20.627 --> 24:21.879
Some guy's listing a bunch of
half-used cream paint buckets

24:21.879 --> 24:22.671
for a dollar each.

24:22.671 --> 24:23.964
We gotta go.

24:23.964 --> 24:25.174
Oh, are we not
going to my house?

24:25.174 --> 24:26.300
Well, hello there.

24:26.300 --> 24:27.885
Who might you be?

24:27.885 --> 24:29.261
Well, that's a
complicated question.

24:29.261 --> 24:31.096
But for now, suffice it to
say that I'm an astrologist,

24:31.096 --> 24:32.389
junior SETI researcher,
pog champion,

24:32.389 --> 24:33.891
Smithsonian star
cataloger, omnivore,

24:33.891 --> 24:35.684
and proud member
of the human race.

24:35.684 --> 24:36.935
You can call me Calvin Kipler.

24:36.935 --> 24:38.896
Teach me everything.

24:38.896 --> 24:40.898
Me and Calvin are just
working on a research project

24:40.898 --> 24:42.232
at his house, so that's all.

24:42.232 --> 24:43.025
End of story.

24:43.025 --> 24:44.067
Sounds fun.

24:44.067 --> 24:44.860
What's the project?

24:44.860 --> 24:45.861
So it's a, um-

24:45.861 --> 24:47.279
It's top secret.

24:47.279 --> 24:48.864
Right, right.

24:48.864 --> 24:52.034
Yeah, so we'll be at his
house working on the project.

24:52.034 --> 24:52.868
For school.

24:52.868 --> 24:54.119
Well, all right.

24:54.119 --> 24:55.787
That sounds like a plan.

24:55.787 --> 24:57.122
All right, well, it was
very nice to meet you all.

24:57.122 --> 24:58.957
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

24:58.957 --> 24:59.750
Yes.

24:59.750 --> 25:00.667
Live long and prosper.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.920
Don't, don't, don't do that.

25:02.920 --> 25:04.546
It's "Star Trek."

25:04.546 --> 25:05.297
Bye.

25:22.231 --> 25:24.024
So what do your parents do?

25:24.024 --> 25:27.361
Oh, um, I actually
live with my grandma.

25:28.654 --> 25:30.364
Oh, no, no, no, I
don't think she's home.

25:30.364 --> 25:33.867
She, uh, she's a
volunteer brain surgeon.

25:34.701 --> 25:35.619
Cool grandma.

25:35.619 --> 25:37.579
Yeah, so it's this way.

25:42.918 --> 25:43.919
Shall we?

25:45.379 --> 25:47.464
Right, the notes, yeah.

25:49.174 --> 25:49.925
Totally.

25:57.182 --> 25:58.433
What's wrong?

25:58.433 --> 26:01.937
Nothing, I'm just
trying to remember them.

26:03.730 --> 26:04.565
Okay, uh...

26:15.909 --> 26:16.827
Interesting.

26:20.163 --> 26:22.541
This does feel otherworldly.

26:29.006 --> 26:30.924
Did you take that photo?

26:30.924 --> 26:35.762
Oh, yeah, that's from the
night my parents disappeared.

26:35.762 --> 26:36.513
What?

26:38.515 --> 26:39.683
What happened?

26:40.642 --> 26:43.228
It's a long story.

26:43.228 --> 26:47.274
You don't have to tell
me if you don't want to.

26:48.442 --> 26:49.359
I don't know.

26:49.359 --> 26:50.819
I just feel like if I do,

26:50.819 --> 26:53.322
you won't want to hang
out with me anymore.

26:53.322 --> 26:54.907
That's not true.

26:56.617 --> 26:57.784
I'm listening.

27:00.704 --> 27:05.667
Okay, well, October
21st, 2012 at 9:44 p.m.,

27:08.045 --> 27:09.463
Jesper's Comet made
its 10-year journey

27:09.463 --> 27:11.131
back into Earth's orbit.

27:11.131 --> 27:13.467
So my dad and I
set up our homemade

27:13.467 --> 27:15.636
camera telescope
to photograph it

27:15.636 --> 27:18.889
and my parents were
never able to see it.

27:19.932 --> 27:20.933
Where did they go?

27:20.933 --> 27:23.268
They didn't go anywhere.

27:23.268 --> 27:24.978
They were taken.

27:24.978 --> 27:26.271
Taken?

27:26.271 --> 27:27.814
Taken by who?

27:36.615 --> 27:37.533
Aliens?

27:37.533 --> 27:38.784
UFO spottings happen all along

27:38.784 --> 27:39.910
Jesper's Comet's flight path.

27:39.910 --> 27:41.954
See, it's all here.

27:41.954 --> 27:43.997
And it's coming
back, Jesper's Comet.

27:43.997 --> 27:46.041
It'll make its 10-year
appearance again in 41 days.

27:46.041 --> 27:50.879
And if I'm right, which I
am, they're coming back, too.

27:50.879 --> 27:53.632
My parents are
coming back for me.

27:55.008 --> 27:56.301
Calvin, this is-

27:56.301 --> 27:57.594
Please, don't say
crazy, because it is all-

27:57.594 --> 27:59.429
Incredible!

27:59.429 --> 28:01.723
Calvin, this is incredible.

28:06.395 --> 28:07.145
Really?

28:08.897 --> 28:09.648
Yeah.

28:11.775 --> 28:14.111
Can you tell me more about it?

28:17.656 --> 28:18.740
Yeah, yeah.

28:22.119 --> 28:24.162
And then he's telling me
he's tracking this comet

28:24.162 --> 28:26.331
because he thinks that the
aliens that abducted his parents

28:26.331 --> 28:28.876
are following it, and I'm
like, "Why?" and he's like,

28:28.876 --> 28:31.086
"Because so when it comes
back, I'm gonna go with them."

28:33.714 --> 28:35.799
Wow, this is fantastic.

28:37.426 --> 28:38.677
Really?

28:38.677 --> 28:40.679
Yeah, I mean,
it's no Nobel Prize,

28:40.679 --> 28:43.015
but I can see the title now:

28:43.015 --> 28:45.309
"Delusional Pebble Falls
High Schooler Thinks Parents

28:45.309 --> 28:49.021
"Were Abducted by Aliens and
He's Finna Get Abducted Too."

28:49.021 --> 28:50.939
Well, I don't think
he's delusional.

28:50.939 --> 28:52.566
I think he's more,
kind of like a sad,

28:52.566 --> 28:54.860
like, pathetic little
puppy, you know?

28:54.860 --> 28:55.986
Right, sad and pathetic.

28:55.986 --> 28:56.904
I love that.

28:56.904 --> 28:57.946
No, I didn't say that.

28:57.946 --> 29:00.032
I just mean he's like,
I don't know, he's-

29:00.032 --> 29:01.074
Crazy?

29:01.074 --> 29:03.035
No, I mean, yeah but,

29:03.952 --> 29:06.705
that one sounds a
little bit insensitive.

29:06.705 --> 29:08.123
You may be right.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.251
There's an emotional
heart to this story

29:11.251 --> 29:12.878
that I think we're overlooking

29:12.878 --> 29:14.671
because we're getting too
wrapped up in the whole

29:14.671 --> 29:17.049
spectacle of the alien
abduction, you know?

29:17.049 --> 29:19.718
This is a story of a boy
looking for his parents.

29:19.718 --> 29:21.803
And they just so happen
to be abducted by aliens.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.096
That's the hook.

29:23.096 --> 29:24.264
But the heart of the
story is the fact

29:24.264 --> 29:25.849
that he's trying to find them.

29:25.849 --> 29:27.935
Like if he finds
them, he's completed,

29:27.935 --> 29:29.269
he's great, he's amazing.

29:29.269 --> 29:33.315
If not, well, like who
even is he, you know?

29:33.315 --> 29:34.107
Itsy?

29:34.107 --> 29:36.235
Hello?

29:36.235 --> 29:36.985
Yeah.

29:38.862 --> 29:39.613
Okay.

29:40.781 --> 29:42.157
So you keep on hanging
out with Calvin

29:42.157 --> 29:45.035
and I want as much
information as possible, okay?

29:45.035 --> 29:48.038
I'm talking photos,
documentation, everything.

29:48.038 --> 29:50.249
And then I'll write it
into a readable format,

29:50.249 --> 29:53.001
and we will be in
NYC in no time.

29:53.001 --> 29:54.795
Well, can I see what
you've written so far?

29:57.381 --> 30:00.092
This is a team
effort, remember?

30:00.092 --> 30:01.844
So I'll handle all the writing,

30:01.844 --> 30:04.221
and you focus on our
weird little friend, okay?

30:04.221 --> 30:05.055
Sound good?

30:05.055 --> 30:06.890
Sounds good.

30:06.890 --> 30:07.891
Good.

30:09.142 --> 30:13.522
Um, well I have to get to
horseback riding lessons, so...

30:13.522 --> 30:14.314
That's cool.

30:14.314 --> 30:16.024
Yeah, okay.

30:16.024 --> 30:16.942
Oh, I leave; okay.

30:16.942 --> 30:18.861
Yeah, that's great.

30:24.908 --> 30:27.077
You're cleared to enter.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.580
Hey, cutie bug.

30:30.789 --> 30:32.207
What's all this for?

30:32.207 --> 30:33.876
These are photos for a
article that me and Calvin

30:33.876 --> 30:35.961
are working on for
a summer program

30:35.961 --> 30:38.589
at NYU's School of Journalism.

30:38.589 --> 30:40.048
Wow, what's the article on?

30:40.048 --> 30:42.301
We're leaning towards aliens.

30:42.301 --> 30:44.761
You mean like, SETI, right?

30:44.761 --> 30:45.846
What's SETI?

30:45.846 --> 30:48.015
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

30:48.015 --> 30:49.850
Well,
that sounds amazing-

30:49.850 --> 30:51.852
Don't drink that.

30:51.852 --> 30:53.228
Actually, go ahead.

30:53.228 --> 30:55.647
By the way, your
mom and I are gonna be

30:55.647 --> 30:59.193
flying into the city to
tie up some loose ends-

30:59.193 --> 31:00.861
Whoo.

31:00.861 --> 31:02.988
So we'd like for you to
take care of each other

31:02.988 --> 31:04.281
for the next few days.

31:04.281 --> 31:05.782
You know, take Evan
to school and whatnot.

31:05.782 --> 31:07.159
Can I go?

31:07.159 --> 31:08.952
Please, you guys know that
I've been dying to go back!

31:08.952 --> 31:10.037
You guys have school-

31:10.037 --> 31:11.246
Yeah.

31:11.246 --> 31:14.374
And it's more of a
romantic weekend getaway, so,

31:14.374 --> 31:16.001
no kids allowed.

31:18.337 --> 31:19.963
So dinner's in 15.

31:19.963 --> 31:21.131
Don't worry, sis.

31:21.131 --> 31:22.883
I'll stay out of your way.

31:22.883 --> 31:24.301
Probably.

31:26.178 --> 31:29.056
Can you at least
close the door?

31:29.056 --> 31:29.806
Evan!

31:31.433 --> 31:32.684
So when's the next
time Jesper's Comet

31:32.684 --> 31:34.019
is supposed to come back?

31:34.019 --> 31:36.480
Approximately 38 days,
seven hours, and 32 minutes.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.065
And then what happens
when it comes back?

31:38.065 --> 31:40.192
Well, I will be there
to greet them, duh.

31:40.192 --> 31:42.861
But have you ever
seen the aliens before?

31:42.861 --> 31:45.364
Well, I have seen
evidence of them.

31:45.364 --> 31:46.990
But not them-them.

31:46.990 --> 31:48.033
More or less.

31:48.033 --> 31:49.034
Philips head?

31:50.452 --> 31:51.662
More-more, or more-less?

31:51.662 --> 31:52.996
Um, more-more.

31:53.997 --> 31:55.499
How do you even know
that this is safe,

31:55.499 --> 31:57.918
trying to contact
aliens and such?

31:57.918 --> 31:59.002
It totally is.

32:01.046 --> 32:01.922
Probably.

32:09.179 --> 32:10.764
We'll see.

32:10.764 --> 32:11.598
Not safe.

32:13.392 --> 32:14.893
Now it's safe.

32:14.893 --> 32:16.520
Wow do you even know
they're still out there?

32:16.520 --> 32:18.897
Well, when was the last time
you saw your grandparents?

32:18.897 --> 32:20.065
I don't know.

32:20.065 --> 32:20.732
It's been a couple years.

32:20.732 --> 32:22.067
Why?

32:22.067 --> 32:23.110
Well, how do you know
they're still out there?

32:23.110 --> 32:24.027
Okay, that's not
even the same thing,

32:24.027 --> 32:25.320
and I can call my grandparents

32:25.320 --> 32:26.572
to make sure that
they're still there.

32:26.572 --> 32:27.948
Yeah, so can I.

32:27.948 --> 32:29.658
You can call aliens?

32:29.658 --> 32:30.450
When? Where?

32:30.450 --> 32:31.243
With what? With who?

32:31.243 --> 32:32.035
Why? How?

32:32.035 --> 32:33.161
How often? How come?

32:33.161 --> 32:34.454
What took you so long?

32:34.454 --> 32:35.873
My legs haven't
fully developed yet.

32:35.873 --> 32:38.000
Also, I'm not a very
good bike rider.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.252
So you were saying
you can contact aliens by-

32:40.252 --> 32:42.129
Wait, does this PB&J
have mustard on it?

32:42.129 --> 32:42.921
No.

32:42.921 --> 32:43.922
Dang it.

32:45.632 --> 32:47.301
Thank you.

32:49.094 --> 32:50.679
What's going on?

32:50.679 --> 32:52.181
Intercepting a signal.

32:52.181 --> 32:53.849
Holy cow, this is happening!

32:53.849 --> 32:54.892
How do you know
when it's gonna-

32:54.892 --> 32:55.684
Shhh.

33:03.150 --> 33:05.944
Subway drive through,
what can I get for you?

33:05.944 --> 33:08.822
Hey, so we just
ordered some sandwiches

33:08.822 --> 33:10.824
but the PB&Js didn't come
with mustard on them.

33:10.824 --> 33:12.201
Hi, Calvin.

33:12.201 --> 33:13.994
If you wanna swing by, we'll
make another sandwich for you.

33:13.994 --> 33:15.037
Awesome.

33:15.037 --> 33:15.829
Thank you, Heidi.

33:15.829 --> 33:17.372
I will see you soon.

33:18.498 --> 33:19.291
Yeah.

33:19.291 --> 33:20.209
Where's the bathroom?

33:20.209 --> 33:21.335
Uh, second bush on your right.

33:21.335 --> 33:22.085
Okay.

33:22.961 --> 33:24.880
And you, follow me.

33:26.757 --> 33:28.008
You could have called them.

33:28.008 --> 33:30.802
Okay, but that
was so much cooler.

33:33.222 --> 33:34.515
So what's that?

33:34.515 --> 33:37.476
It measures Earth's
electromagnetic fields.

33:37.476 --> 33:39.353
And then what's that button?

33:39.353 --> 33:44.191
Broadcasts a warning to all
networks in a 50-mile radius.

33:47.486 --> 33:48.403
What's that?

33:48.403 --> 33:49.613
That is an alarm signifying

33:49.613 --> 33:50.906
that something has
entered our atmosphere,

33:50.906 --> 33:51.865
and we've got less
than 30 seconds

33:51.865 --> 33:52.783
to launch a counterattack.

33:52.783 --> 33:53.534
Are you serious right now?

33:53.534 --> 33:54.451
Are we about to die?

33:54.451 --> 33:55.035
Why aren't you taking notes?

33:55.035 --> 33:55.994
I don't know.

33:55.994 --> 33:56.954
What am I supposed to write?

33:56.954 --> 33:58.455
November 11th at 4:13 p.m.

33:58.455 --> 34:00.082
Calvin proves he is the
smartest, coolest person

34:00.082 --> 34:01.250
that Itsy knows.

34:04.086 --> 34:05.838
I'm gonna kill you.

34:05.838 --> 34:06.922
That was evil.

34:06.922 --> 34:08.590
"OMG, are we gonna,
like, die right now?"

34:08.590 --> 34:09.466
That's not what I said.

34:09.466 --> 34:10.342
Hey, what's the-

34:10.342 --> 34:12.010
You're not funny.

34:12.010 --> 34:13.512
Hey Calvin, I didn't know
which one was the pee bush,

34:13.512 --> 34:16.473
so I peed a little
on all of them...

34:17.975 --> 34:19.852
What's going on here?

34:19.852 --> 34:22.020
- Nothing.
- Nothing, what?

34:22.020 --> 34:22.980
Nothing.

34:22.980 --> 34:24.314
- What?
- Nothing.

34:26.817 --> 34:28.777
So, who wants to
talk to some aliens?

34:28.777 --> 34:30.028
Yes. When?

34:30.028 --> 34:30.988
Right now.

34:34.241 --> 34:35.617
Anything?

34:35.617 --> 34:36.952
Nope.

34:36.952 --> 34:37.911
Don't probe me!

34:37.911 --> 34:38.829
I'm sensitive!

34:41.498 --> 34:42.833
Hello?

34:43.876 --> 34:44.960
Hello, is anybody there?

34:45.878 --> 34:47.004
This is Calvin Kipler speaking.

34:47.004 --> 34:47.754
Hello.

34:49.756 --> 34:51.008
Dang it.

34:51.008 --> 34:51.925
What?

34:51.925 --> 34:53.719
We just missed it.

34:57.472 --> 34:58.265
Going to the bathroom.

34:58.265 --> 34:59.057
I'll be right back.

34:59.057 --> 34:59.850
Oh, no, no, no.

34:59.850 --> 35:01.226
You can't go in there.

35:01.226 --> 35:02.394
Calvin, I'm not
gonna pee in a bush.

35:02.394 --> 35:03.312
Just let me go inside.

35:03.312 --> 35:05.606
But, my grandma's sleeping.

35:05.606 --> 35:06.356
Naked.

35:07.441 --> 35:08.859
And she sleepwalks.

35:11.904 --> 35:16.700
Your grandma doesn't actually
live with you, does she?

35:18.619 --> 35:19.369
No.

35:21.038 --> 35:22.831
Then where is she?

35:22.831 --> 35:24.333
Well, that depends on if
you believe in an afterlife

35:24.333 --> 35:26.210
and that sort of thing.

35:28.504 --> 35:29.254
Shoot.

35:30.964 --> 35:33.008
Calvin, I'm really sorry.

35:34.426 --> 35:36.011
When did she pass?

35:36.970 --> 35:38.972
Couple years back.

35:38.972 --> 35:41.600
But she knew if we
didn't keep it a secret,

35:41.600 --> 35:43.477
that once she died they'd
put me in a foster home

35:43.477 --> 35:46.730
and then I couldn't keep
looking for my parents.

35:46.730 --> 35:49.900
So, she taught me
how to pay the bills

35:51.318 --> 35:52.528
and take care of myself,

35:52.528 --> 35:56.031
and I have been doing
that ever since.

35:56.031 --> 35:57.491
You've been on your
own all these years?

35:57.491 --> 35:59.451
Yeah well, there's
nothin' new about that.

35:59.451 --> 36:02.037
So um, the bathroom
is in on the,

36:05.624 --> 36:06.792
on your right.

36:13.465 --> 36:15.342
Um, yeah, the bathroom.

36:17.094 --> 36:18.595
Yes.

36:18.595 --> 36:19.346
Wait!

36:20.389 --> 36:22.558
Look, make a wish.

36:22.558 --> 36:25.811
I didn't think
you'd do that, too.

36:25.811 --> 36:28.230
I thought you'd just say there's
no point in wishing on it.

36:28.230 --> 36:29.815
Yeah, well, shooting
stars are basically

36:29.815 --> 36:32.442
just metallic particles with
gases like hydrogen and helium,

36:32.442 --> 36:36.530
but I've spent so much
time looking at the sky

36:36.530 --> 36:39.950
I figure if one in a
million grant my wish,

36:39.950 --> 36:42.077
I'm already halfway there.

36:42.077 --> 36:46.248
You know, my dad said the light
from each one of those stars

36:46.248 --> 36:47.958
took millions and-

36:47.958 --> 36:50.502
Millions of
years to get to us.

36:50.502 --> 36:53.797
I mean, just think of
what it was like here

36:53.797 --> 36:56.675
when that light
was first sent out.

36:58.010 --> 36:59.887
You mean, like dinosaurs?

36:59.887 --> 37:03.974
Oh much, much before
dinosaurs, kiddo.

37:03.974 --> 37:08.103
Most likely just noxious
gas and raw elements.

37:08.103 --> 37:10.772
But it's possible that some
of that starlight was sent out

37:10.772 --> 37:14.610
when the earth was just
bits of stardust, too.

37:14.610 --> 37:17.404
Back when the universe
was brand new, and cold,

37:17.404 --> 37:20.824
and just starting
to form itself.

37:20.824 --> 37:22.367
How awesome is that?

37:24.912 --> 37:29.875
And who knows, maybe there's
an alien dad and alien kid

37:29.875 --> 37:32.085
out there looking at us, too.

37:33.253 --> 37:34.213
You think?

37:35.964 --> 37:38.008
Only one way to find out.

37:39.927 --> 37:41.845
Hello out there!

37:41.845 --> 37:43.347
My name is Cyrus!

37:43.347 --> 37:45.891
And this is my
alien son, Calvin!

37:45.891 --> 37:47.809
Hello out there, aliens.

37:47.809 --> 37:49.061
Oh, you gotta be
louder than that.

37:49.061 --> 37:50.145
They can't hear that.

37:50.145 --> 37:52.022
Hello out there!

37:52.022 --> 37:54.399
Hello, can you hear us?

37:54.399 --> 37:57.903
Hello, nice to meet
you, alien buddies!

37:57.903 --> 38:00.906
Hello, aliens!

38:00.906 --> 38:01.698

I love it.

38:44.366 --> 38:45.909
This is perfect.

38:45.909 --> 38:46.910
I think this is finally
enough to finish our article.

38:46.910 --> 38:47.703
Really?

38:47.703 --> 38:49.037
You think that's enough?

38:49.037 --> 38:51.707
Yeah, I mean, he
is a crazy person.

38:51.707 --> 38:54.877
Forget the UFOs, the peanut
butter and jelly and mustard,

38:54.877 --> 38:56.879
that is enough for the
kid to be an outcast.

38:56.879 --> 39:01.091
For his own sake, I
hope Jasper's Comet
does come to town.

39:01.091 --> 39:02.176
It's Jesper.

39:03.886 --> 39:05.888
Okay, whatever.

39:05.888 --> 39:07.181
Still going to be
a great article,

39:07.181 --> 39:09.975
and NYU's going to love it.

39:09.975 --> 39:11.602
I just, I don't know.

39:11.602 --> 39:13.187
I feel like we need
a different title.

39:13.187 --> 39:14.855
You know, maybe like,

39:14.855 --> 39:18.984
"Aliens Aren't the Weirdest
Thing in Pebble Falls."

39:18.984 --> 39:20.861
Yeah, no, I...

39:20.861 --> 39:23.488
Or "Pebble-Brained
in Pebble Falls?"

39:23.488 --> 39:25.824
Oh, wait, no, no, no, I have it.

39:25.824 --> 39:29.494
"Bit Space Delusions,
Small-Town Dope."

39:29.494 --> 39:32.080
But he's not an idiot.

39:32.080 --> 39:32.998
What?

39:32.998 --> 39:33.916
I said, he's not an idiot.

39:33.916 --> 39:36.043
He's actually
really, really smart.

39:36.043 --> 39:37.127
I mean, look at this stuff.

39:37.127 --> 39:39.880
Telescopes, radiation
detector, magnometers,

39:39.880 --> 39:42.090
and he made all of
it from scratch.

39:42.090 --> 39:44.968
If anything, he's the smartest
person in this stupid town.

39:44.968 --> 39:47.012
And yeah, his story's a
little bit far-fetched,

39:47.012 --> 39:50.599
but he's fighting for something,
and he has goals, and...

39:51.475 --> 39:53.936
he has a good heart.

39:53.936 --> 39:56.772
I think I know what
our title should be.

39:56.772 --> 39:59.107
"City Girl Falls
for Village Idiot."

39:59.107 --> 40:00.484
I'm not
falling for him.

40:00.484 --> 40:01.276
Oh, really?

40:01.276 --> 40:02.903
Then do you believe him?

40:02.903 --> 40:05.364
Do you believe his parents
were abducted by aliens?

40:05.364 --> 40:06.823
No, of course not.

40:06.823 --> 40:08.909
Are you sure?

40:12.496 --> 40:14.373
I think I'm gonna go.

40:17.376 --> 40:19.962
Don't publish the article yet.

40:22.130 --> 40:23.715
Talk to you later.

40:40.023 --> 40:41.441
Calvin?

40:41.441 --> 40:42.150
Yeah?

40:43.485 --> 40:47.322
Um, you know, I was, I
was kinda just thinking.

40:50.033 --> 40:52.744
What if your parents
weren't abducted by aliens?

40:52.744 --> 40:55.497
Well, that is impossible
because I saw it.

40:55.497 --> 40:58.959
I get that, but it was
a really long time ago.

40:58.959 --> 41:01.545
And you were really young,
and kids have a hard time

41:01.545 --> 41:03.046
remembering traumatic
things like-

41:03.046 --> 41:06.341
Like their parents
being abducted by aliens?

41:06.341 --> 41:08.510
Like their parents
abandoning them.

41:08.510 --> 41:10.846
My parents didn't
abandon me, Itsy.

41:10.846 --> 41:12.389
I can prove it.

41:12.389 --> 41:14.474
'Kay, December 5th, 2016.

41:16.059 --> 41:18.812
The star called Nimbus in
the constellation Andromeda

41:18.812 --> 41:23.317
blinked the morse
code for P-N-C-A-K-S.

41:23.317 --> 41:24.818
What am I missing here?

41:24.818 --> 41:26.069
It's pancakes.

41:26.069 --> 41:28.113
Duh, I mean, my
dad made pancakes

41:28.113 --> 41:29.990
the very morning he disappeared.

41:29.990 --> 41:31.241
It's obviously a
message from them

41:31.241 --> 41:34.620
telling me that they're
still out there.

41:35.954 --> 41:40.667
Calvin, I think you need
real evidence of a UFO.

41:40.667 --> 41:45.589
Okay, well I do have,
like, photographic memory.

41:47.132 --> 41:49.092
I have photographic memory.

41:49.092 --> 41:49.885
It's very rare.

41:49.885 --> 41:51.011
Self-diagnosed.

41:52.930 --> 41:54.723
But I have plenty of
pictures of the comet

41:54.723 --> 41:56.016
in here somewhere.

42:08.028 --> 42:09.530
Are these them?

42:09.530 --> 42:11.156
Hmm?

42:11.156 --> 42:13.867
Is this your parents?

42:13.867 --> 42:15.160
Yeah, yeah, that is.

42:15.160 --> 42:16.620
Now, where is it?

42:25.003 --> 42:25.838
Ah, okay.

42:25.838 --> 42:26.964
See, here it is.

42:30.092 --> 42:32.052
Okay, but this is only
the 8-millimeter preview

42:32.052 --> 42:34.304
of the original
35-millimeter film,

42:34.304 --> 42:37.057
so it's like one sixth
the original scale.

42:37.891 --> 42:38.934
One fourth.

42:39.935 --> 42:41.979
For a genius, you are
so bad at fractions.

42:41.979 --> 42:43.021
Okay.

42:43.021 --> 42:44.147
See, okay, but it's there.

42:44.147 --> 42:46.066
Right there.

42:46.066 --> 42:47.693
Yeah, it's kinda hard to see.

42:47.693 --> 42:49.528
Why don't you develop it?

42:49.528 --> 42:51.196
I mean, there's an old
photo shop back in town,

42:51.196 --> 42:53.866
but it closed down
a couple years ago.

42:53.866 --> 42:58.078
I already know it's there,
so like, what's the point?

43:00.998 --> 43:03.375
Why don't I just take this

43:03.375 --> 43:07.880
and I'll put it in my next
batch of film to be developed.

43:07.880 --> 43:08.964
Yeah, sure.

43:10.757 --> 43:13.844
Anyways, I was
thinking it's a good idea

43:13.844 --> 43:15.971
to start applying to some
schools for the fall.

43:15.971 --> 43:17.264
I'm not going to college.

43:17.264 --> 43:18.891
What do you mean?

43:18.891 --> 43:19.683
You'd probably get a really
good scholarship somewhere

43:19.683 --> 43:20.976
like MIT or NYU.

43:20.976 --> 43:22.019
I'm not going to college

43:22.019 --> 43:23.312
because I don't plan on
being on this planet,

43:23.312 --> 43:25.022
not because I don't
think I could get in.

43:29.985 --> 43:32.946
You really think
they're still out there?

43:32.946 --> 43:34.448
Yeah, I do.

44:23.288 --> 44:24.331
Oh my gosh.

44:26.041 --> 44:26.875
Calvin.

44:34.716 --> 44:36.760
Since the
discovery of the solar system,

44:36.760 --> 44:37.678
mankind has-

44:37.678 --> 44:39.012
Hey, where are you going?

44:39.012 --> 44:40.138
By the
endless possibilities-

44:40.138 --> 44:41.974
Camping with Calvin.

44:41.974 --> 44:43.934
Um, take the bus
to school, okay?

44:43.934 --> 44:48.313
And here is the money that
Mom and Dad gave me for food.

44:48.313 --> 44:50.649
Order whatever you
want for dinner.

44:50.649 --> 44:52.818
Triple pepperoni pizza?

44:52.818 --> 44:54.069
I don't care.

44:54.069 --> 44:54.820
Bye.

44:55.821 --> 44:58.407
Camping in the winter?

45:00.033 --> 45:03.245
Point
of experimentation.

45:04.955 --> 45:05.956
Get in.

45:06.832 --> 45:08.041
What?

45:08.041 --> 45:10.335
Get in, we're
going on a road trip.

45:10.335 --> 45:11.587
Road trip?

45:11.587 --> 45:12.880
But I was about to
oxidize my moon boots.

45:12.880 --> 45:14.965
Well, I recently
made a discovery

45:14.965 --> 45:17.426
regarding our
top-secret project.

45:17.426 --> 45:18.218
Really?

45:18.218 --> 45:19.636
What is it?

45:19.636 --> 45:20.971
Well, obviously, I can't say.

45:20.971 --> 45:23.515
Somebody could be listening.

45:25.017 --> 45:26.310
Time is of the essence,

45:26.310 --> 45:27.853
and we need to be in Billings,
Montana by this weekend.

45:27.853 --> 45:29.104
Wait, but the
orbit isn't happ-

45:32.941 --> 45:35.986
Your discovery needs to be
discovered this weekend?

45:35.986 --> 45:36.987
Yes, but it's fine.

45:36.987 --> 45:38.906
We'll be back in
time for the comet.

45:38.906 --> 45:41.575
So are you in or not?

45:41.575 --> 45:44.286
I'm gonna go
grab my space suit.

45:56.673 --> 45:58.008
Any music requests?

45:58.008 --> 46:00.511
Oh, Super Space Talk
Radio with Hank Fujiwara,

46:00.511 --> 46:01.512
episode 429.

46:02.804 --> 46:04.139
Why 429?

46:04.139 --> 46:05.849
'Cause I love that one.

46:05.849 --> 46:06.892
So good.

46:08.060 --> 46:09.353
I'm Hank Fujiwara.

46:09.353 --> 46:11.063
You may remember me
from my other podcast,

46:11.063 --> 46:13.065
"Inner Space with
Hank Fujiwara."

46:13.065 --> 46:14.316
Today's episode-

46:14.316 --> 46:15.108
it's a real doozy.

46:15.108 --> 46:16.693
What was that?

46:16.693 --> 46:17.986
It's probably just something
tipping over in the back.

46:17.986 --> 46:18.570
Ever heard
about space-time?

46:18.570 --> 46:19.488
Not space time-

46:19.488 --> 46:20.405
Ooh, but I love this part.

46:20.405 --> 46:21.907
See, Hank's theory is that time

46:21.907 --> 46:23.283
functions differently in space.

46:23.283 --> 46:25.035
And he's got this crazy
idea where if you were to

46:25.035 --> 46:28.080
go into space with the,
like, space continuum,

46:28.080 --> 46:29.957
it kind of builds up.

46:29.957 --> 46:33.585
It's interesting
.

46:33.585 --> 46:34.837
You've seen "Toy Story"

46:34.837 --> 46:36.046
which I'm sure
that you all have.

46:36.046 --> 46:38.423
Oh, I brought some snacks.

46:41.426 --> 46:42.845
Oreos and-

46:42.845 --> 46:44.721
Orange juice.

46:44.721 --> 46:45.556
You're joking.

46:45.556 --> 46:46.849
Just try one.

46:46.849 --> 46:48.934
This is gonna
ruin Oreos for me.

46:48.934 --> 46:49.852
Uh uh.

46:49.852 --> 46:51.478
It's gonna blow your mind.

46:58.610 --> 46:59.903
Now, in space-

46:59.903 --> 47:00.654
Well?

47:01.989 --> 47:03.031
Mm hm!

47:03.031 --> 47:04.074
Yes!

47:04.074 --> 47:04.825
Whoa!

47:05.742 --> 47:06.493
The problem is that-

47:06.493 --> 47:07.244
They're good, right?

47:08.412 --> 47:10.080
There it was again.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.248
Is there anything?

47:11.248 --> 47:12.833
No, nothing.

47:12.833 --> 47:15.460
Slinky Dog's caboose,
and hits you all at once.

47:15.460 --> 47:18.964
If there's some
sort (fades out).

47:18.964 --> 47:23.260
Unable to move faster than
.

47:23.260 --> 47:24.928
Geez, hungry much?

47:24.928 --> 47:25.846
Yeah, a little.

47:25.846 --> 47:28.265
Yeah, you wanna hand 'em over?

47:28.265 --> 47:30.225
I just gave them to you.

47:34.730 --> 47:37.024
I'm gonna strangle
you, you idiot!

47:37.024 --> 47:37.941
Don't kill me!

47:37.941 --> 47:39.902
Calvin save me!

47:39.902 --> 47:41.904
Taking him back would
be a 6-hour round trip.

47:41.904 --> 47:43.697
We could put him on a bus.

47:43.697 --> 47:44.948
He'd probably just
get off at the next stop

47:44.948 --> 47:46.575
and get on one
headed our direction.

47:46.575 --> 47:47.868
How?

47:47.868 --> 47:48.619
He doesn't even know
where we're going.

47:48.619 --> 47:49.369
Billings, Montana.

47:49.369 --> 47:50.704
Shut up, Evan.

47:50.704 --> 47:52.039
See, I think we
gotta take him with us.

47:52.039 --> 47:53.373
No.

47:53.373 --> 47:54.666
What do you wanna do?

47:54.666 --> 47:56.043
Leave him tied up on
the side of the road?

47:56.043 --> 47:57.461
We'll leave him with water.

47:57.461 --> 47:58.921
Mom and Dad said you were
supposed to take care of me

47:58.921 --> 48:00.214
while they were gone.

48:00.214 --> 48:02.925
Unless you want me to tell
them you left me at home alone.

48:02.925 --> 48:05.594
Poor little old Evan.

48:05.594 --> 48:08.055
Fine, under one condition.

48:08.055 --> 48:10.807
You obey all orders,
you do everything I ask,

48:10.807 --> 48:14.770
and you don't annoy me
or else I'm ditching you.

48:15.854 --> 48:16.939
That's like three conditions-

48:16.939 --> 48:17.981
Evan!

48:17.981 --> 48:19.691
Okay, deal.

48:19.691 --> 48:21.193
All right, well, we should
probably hit the road.

48:21.193 --> 48:22.486
Ooh, can I have shotgun?

48:22.486 --> 48:23.862
No!

48:27.783 --> 48:30.285
Ooh, should we
put some tunes on?

48:31.912 --> 48:33.622
Are these salt
and vinegar chips?

48:33.622 --> 48:34.998
They look del...

48:37.501 --> 48:38.252
Fine.

48:45.759 --> 48:47.010
I farted.

48:47.010 --> 48:47.803
Oh!

48:47.803 --> 48:48.887
Oh, that one's bad.

48:48.887 --> 48:49.930
Oh, that's bad.

48:49.930 --> 48:51.431
Geez, Evan.

48:51.431 --> 48:52.558
Oh, oh!

48:52.558 --> 48:54.643
You were asking for it.

48:55.602 --> 48:57.855
Geez, my eyes can smell it.

49:00.023 --> 49:01.900
Still no service.

49:01.900 --> 49:03.068
Okay, well, there
should be a map

49:03.068 --> 49:04.778
in the glove compartment.

49:19.877 --> 49:21.336
I don't know how to use this.

49:21.336 --> 49:23.088
Of course you don't.

49:23.088 --> 49:26.049
You have it upside
down, by the way.

49:27.843 --> 49:28.844
Okay.

49:30.137 --> 49:31.680
This is where you
almost left me for dead

49:31.680 --> 49:33.682
on the side of the highway.

49:33.682 --> 49:36.768
This is where we saw
that dead possum.

49:36.768 --> 49:41.064
This about where we
should be, right there.

49:41.064 --> 49:42.900
learn it.

49:43.901 --> 49:46.069
Fine, you can be in
charge of the map then.

49:47.654 --> 49:49.740
Ah, much better.

49:49.740 --> 49:51.033

Awesome, thanks, Itsy.

50:34.826 --> 50:37.538
'Kay, who wants to
tell a campfire story?

50:37.538 --> 50:38.914
I'll start.

50:38.914 --> 50:42.960
This is the story of Daniel
and the hungry beaver.

50:42.960 --> 50:46.630
So Daniel was out fishing,
and he saw a beaver.

50:46.630 --> 50:48.048
He took it home-

50:48.048 --> 50:50.008
I think I'm gonna
grab some firewood.

50:50.008 --> 50:51.301
Okay.

50:51.301 --> 50:53.679
He was out fishing
and he found a beaver

50:53.679 --> 50:55.681
who was always hungry.

50:55.681 --> 50:56.932
He took him home and-

50:56.932 --> 50:59.560
I think I'm
gonna go help Itsy.

50:59.560 --> 51:00.561
Okay.

51:00.561 --> 51:02.479
I'll just stay by the fire.

51:02.479 --> 51:03.772
Guarding it.

51:03.772 --> 51:04.648
From water.

51:07.442 --> 51:09.987
Guess I'll just continue
the story by myself.

51:12.239 --> 51:14.825
Hey.

51:14.825 --> 51:16.285
Um, are you having fun?

51:16.285 --> 51:18.662
Oh, yeah, I love
collecting wood.

51:18.662 --> 51:21.874
No, I mean on this
trip in general.

51:21.874 --> 51:24.376
Oh, of course, um...

51:24.376 --> 51:25.335
Are you?

51:25.335 --> 51:27.880
Yeah, I'm having a lot of fun.

51:29.965 --> 51:31.091
Um, hey, Itsy.

51:32.384 --> 51:34.553
There was something I
wanted to say to you,

51:34.553 --> 51:35.929
and I'm sure you
can already tell.

51:35.929 --> 51:39.975
But I'm not really somebody
that has a lot of friends.

51:39.975 --> 51:42.060
People kinda think I'm weird.

51:42.060 --> 51:42.936
You're not weird.

51:42.936 --> 51:43.770
No, I am.

51:45.147 --> 51:47.983
But I like that part
of me, you know?

51:47.983 --> 51:50.903
Just makes it difficult for
other people to really like me.

51:50.903 --> 51:53.280
I found it really
easy to like you.

51:53.280 --> 51:53.989
Really?

51:56.700 --> 51:57.409
Yeah.

51:58.702 --> 52:00.412
I find it really easy.

52:01.872 --> 52:03.999
To really like you.

52:03.999 --> 52:05.000
I um...

52:07.377 --> 52:09.004
I really like you, too.

52:13.550 --> 52:16.011
I-I wanna ask you something.

52:16.011 --> 52:17.054
What is it?

52:17.054 --> 52:19.014
Well, I was wondering.

52:20.933 --> 52:23.852
Itsy, may I have your consent?

52:23.852 --> 52:25.062
My consent?

52:25.062 --> 52:27.147
Yeah, to like, you know...

52:27.147 --> 52:30.025
Geez, Calvin, I don't
think we're ready for that.

52:30.025 --> 52:31.652
Right, I'm sorry.

52:31.652 --> 52:34.238
Kissing's a huge step, and we
should really take that slow.

52:34.238 --> 52:35.531
Hold on.

52:35.531 --> 52:38.200
You were asking for my
consent just to kiss me?

52:38.200 --> 52:39.535
Of course.

52:39.535 --> 52:40.911
I mean, consent is
really important.

52:40.911 --> 52:44.081
Well, in that case, of
course you can kiss me.

52:44.081 --> 52:44.831
Really?

52:46.500 --> 52:47.292
Thank you.

52:47.292 --> 52:48.502
Um, it's an honor.

52:48.502 --> 52:49.920
I, um...

52:49.920 --> 52:50.963
Okay.

52:50.963 --> 52:51.964
Well, if I may.

53:01.056 --> 53:03.267
How much frickin' firewood
are you guys getting?

53:03.267 --> 53:05.435
Oh, oh, oops.

53:05.435 --> 53:07.354
Oh, is that firewood?

53:07.354 --> 53:09.731
I think I'll go investigate.

53:11.358 --> 53:12.985
Um, anyways.

53:14.528 --> 53:15.946
Hey, my foot is stuck.

53:15.946 --> 53:17.656
I stepped in something squishy.

53:17.656 --> 53:21.618
It might be dead, but it
is most certainly squishy.

53:21.618 --> 53:22.828
He'll be fine.

53:22.828 --> 53:23.871
Okay.

53:23.871 --> 53:25.706
Ouch, that hurt!

53:25.706 --> 53:26.748
Okay, it bit me!

53:26.748 --> 53:28.625
I need to see a doctor.

53:30.335 --> 53:32.087
Okay, well, we should
probably go help him.

53:32.087 --> 53:32.838
Yeah.

53:36.258 --> 53:38.719
I think
it's licking me.

53:40.888 --> 53:42.639
Larry, the Hungry.

53:42.639 --> 53:44.016
This kid
is always hungry.

53:44.016 --> 53:45.893
I'm starving.

53:45.893 --> 53:47.561
I could eat a cow, horse-

53:47.561 --> 53:49.021
Or Oreos.

53:49.021 --> 53:51.982
Guys, there's an
old tire someone left here.

53:51.982 --> 53:53.192
When are we gonna get there?

53:53.192 --> 53:54.943
There it is right there.

53:54.943 --> 53:55.944
Yes!

53:57.571 --> 54:00.282
You know, we've seen seven
deer on the side of the road.

54:00.282 --> 54:01.325
Only seven?

54:01.325 --> 54:02.868
We've been driving for so long.

54:02.868 --> 54:03.619
I know.

54:04.870 --> 54:07.956
Hey, gotta keep
track of something.

54:09.041 --> 54:10.918
They sell moose here?

54:10.918 --> 54:12.461
Gross.

54:12.461 --> 54:13.587
'Kay, so we're
having lunch here

54:13.587 --> 54:15.839
and then are we almost there?

54:15.839 --> 54:18.133
Actually, we're here.

54:18.133 --> 54:19.593
This is the last place.

54:19.593 --> 54:20.928
Welcome, guys.

54:20.928 --> 54:23.639
Anything I can get
you started with?

54:23.639 --> 54:24.389
Mom?

54:28.101 --> 54:28.852
Calvin?

54:38.570 --> 54:39.321
Hey.

54:51.875 --> 54:53.961
So um, how's Cyrus doing?

54:55.629 --> 54:56.797
You mean, Dad?

54:56.797 --> 54:58.006
Oh, I'm sorry.

54:58.006 --> 55:00.384
It's probably weird
for me to ask.

55:00.384 --> 55:01.552
I was just curious.

55:01.552 --> 55:03.887
You don't have to answer.

55:03.887 --> 55:06.807
He knows that you're
here at least, right?

55:06.807 --> 55:08.016
No, he doesn't because-

55:08.016 --> 55:11.395
Oh, Calvin, he
must be worried sick!

55:11.395 --> 55:12.604
No, he's not-

55:12.604 --> 55:15.148
Hey, no, you need to call him.

55:18.151 --> 55:18.902
I um

55:20.362 --> 55:21.113
I can't.

55:22.948 --> 55:25.450
Okay, why can't you?

55:25.450 --> 55:27.911
'Cause I don't
know where he is.

55:27.911 --> 55:32.708
I haven't seen him since that
night that you guys, um...

55:34.543 --> 55:36.879
That, that, that night what?

55:38.755 --> 55:42.426
Ms. Kipler, um, from
what Calvin's told me,

55:42.426 --> 55:46.180
he believes that you and Cyrus
disappeared 10 years ago.

55:46.180 --> 55:47.222
Disappeared?

55:47.222 --> 55:48.307
What do you mean?

55:48.307 --> 55:49.349
He thought,

55:50.392 --> 55:51.435
he thinks...

55:52.936 --> 55:53.687
What?

55:55.939 --> 55:57.274
What does he think?

55:57.274 --> 56:00.527
Someone please explain
to me what's going on.

56:00.527 --> 56:01.445
No, wait.

56:04.406 --> 56:05.949
You need to explain.

56:08.869 --> 56:10.662
Where have you been?

56:13.457 --> 56:14.291
Oh, geez.

56:16.793 --> 56:20.172
Where haven't I
been?

56:20.172 --> 56:21.882
I've been all over.

56:23.050 --> 56:24.635
But I, I saw it.

56:25.844 --> 56:26.678
I saw it.

56:26.678 --> 56:28.305
Saw what?

56:28.305 --> 56:29.765
What did you see?

56:31.683 --> 56:33.644
I thought both of
you both were abducted.

56:33.644 --> 56:34.520
Abducted?

56:35.854 --> 56:37.814
By aliens, or something?

56:42.945 --> 56:43.946
No.

56:45.948 --> 56:49.952
No, Calvin, that's not
at all what happened?

56:49.952 --> 56:51.828
Your father and I
were separating.

56:51.828 --> 56:52.829
We were,

56:54.957 --> 56:56.250
we were getting a divorce.

56:56.250 --> 56:59.878
He was supposed to explain
all of that to you.

56:59.878 --> 57:02.506
Vera, Vera, slow down.

57:02.506 --> 57:03.924
Come on.

57:03.924 --> 57:04.925
Come inside and let's sit
down and talk about this.

57:04.925 --> 57:06.009
No.

57:06.009 --> 57:06.760
No, Cy.

57:07.845 --> 57:08.887
If I don't do this now,

57:08.887 --> 57:10.848
it'll just be another
thing that I never did,

57:10.848 --> 57:13.475
and I can't, I can't do this.

57:13.475 --> 57:15.936
I know we had so many plans.

57:15.936 --> 57:19.022
And living in a broken-down
house in the middle of nowhere

57:19.022 --> 57:20.023
was not one them.

57:20.023 --> 57:23.235
Cy, I don't know
what happened to us.

57:23.235 --> 57:25.863
We became a family, Vera.

57:25.863 --> 57:27.906
That's what happened to us.

57:29.366 --> 57:31.493
Vera, please.

57:32.870 --> 57:34.037
I'll let you go.

57:34.037 --> 57:35.831
I promise I will.

57:35.831 --> 57:38.917
At least say goodbye to him.

57:38.917 --> 57:40.502
You know I can't do that.

57:40.502 --> 57:41.253
Why?

57:42.754 --> 57:46.967
Because if I do that
then I will never leave.

57:46.967 --> 57:49.511
Well then maybe you shouldn't.

57:50.846 --> 57:52.848
We can figure it out.

57:52.848 --> 57:55.934
Just tell me what
to do, anything.

57:55.934 --> 57:57.978
Just tell me what you need.

57:59.813 --> 58:02.024
Tell Calvin I'm sorry.

58:14.036 --> 58:15.579
Why did you leave?

58:18.582 --> 58:21.043
Uh,

58:21.043 --> 58:23.504
I don't know, Calvin.

58:23.504 --> 58:24.254
I just...

58:25.464 --> 58:26.215
No.

58:28.675 --> 58:30.886
No, 'cause you need a reason.

58:31.970 --> 58:34.723
Did you need to go somewhere?

58:34.723 --> 58:36.350
Did something happen?

58:37.935 --> 58:40.896
Did I do something wrong?

58:40.896 --> 58:41.688
Did I make you mad?

58:41.688 --> 58:42.940
No, no, no!

58:42.940 --> 58:44.191
You were good.

58:44.191 --> 58:47.736
You did nothing
.

58:47.736 --> 58:49.029
You did nothing wrong.

58:49.029 --> 58:51.490
You're really

58:51.490 --> 58:53.992
a great kid.

58:53.992 --> 58:55.244
Great kid.

58:55.244 --> 58:56.870
I think that I just,

58:56.870 --> 58:59.998
listen, I think that I
wasn't meant to be a mom.

58:59.998 --> 59:02.334
At least not a very
good one, obviously.

59:02.334 --> 59:04.670
No, no, no, 'cause
you were to me.

59:04.670 --> 59:05.420
You were.

59:07.965 --> 59:09.341
You were my mom.

59:13.637 --> 59:15.681
The truth is
that I left because

59:15.681 --> 59:17.683
when your father and I
married, I was so young,

59:17.683 --> 59:21.186
and I barely knew who I was.

59:21.186 --> 59:25.357
And once I figured it out,
I was just so desperate

59:27.359 --> 59:30.529
to get out of that little
town and see the world,

59:30.529 --> 59:33.949
and it felt like
life was out there.

59:33.949 --> 59:36.785
And I was so scared that
I was gonna miss it,

59:36.785 --> 59:40.122
that I was going to
give up anything.

59:40.122 --> 59:42.207
Give up anything, yeah.

59:43.417 --> 59:44.459
You mean me.

59:44.459 --> 59:45.252
No.

59:45.252 --> 59:46.461
Don't say it like that.

59:46.461 --> 59:49.006
No, I wanted to come back.

59:49.006 --> 59:52.551
But the thought of facing you

59:54.094 --> 59:56.847
and your dad.

59:56.847 --> 59:59.766
How could I after I left you?

01:00:01.435 --> 01:00:04.980
So just easier to
let it go, you know,

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:08.400
like water under the bridge.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.652
So you can understand
that, right?

01:00:10.652 --> 01:00:11.653
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:11.653 --> 01:00:12.404
Yeah.

01:00:15.908 --> 01:00:17.576
It's easier just
to forget I exist.

01:00:17.576 --> 01:00:18.368
I get it.

01:00:18.368 --> 01:00:19.953
No.

01:00:19.953 --> 01:00:21.955
Calvin, you're taking all
of this the wrong way.

01:00:21.955 --> 01:00:25.417
I'm saying that all
of this is behind us.

01:00:26.793 --> 01:00:28.003
We can be friends now.

01:00:28.003 --> 01:00:31.006
I don't wanna
to be your friend.

01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:34.468
I wanted to be your son.

01:00:39.932 --> 01:00:40.933
So, let's go.

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:13.924
I'm Hank Fujiwara.

01:01:13.924 --> 01:01:17.928
You may remember me
from my other podcast.

01:01:33.902 --> 01:01:35.863
See you later, Calvin.

01:01:36.989 --> 01:01:38.240
See you, buddy.

01:01:46.123 --> 01:01:49.459
Well, thank you
for the road trip.

01:01:49.459 --> 01:01:50.294
It was, um,

01:01:53.005 --> 01:01:54.339
well, thank you.

01:01:55.299 --> 01:01:56.800
Calvin, I'm sorry.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.554
I didn't know what I
expected your mom to be like-

01:02:00.554 --> 01:02:01.972
It's no big deal.

01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:07.561
It's not like it was
your fault, or anything.

01:02:07.561 --> 01:02:11.940
Well, actually, I've been
meaning to tell you that

01:02:12.983 --> 01:02:13.859
me and Heather, we start-

01:02:16.528 --> 01:02:18.530
Well, I gotta get going.

01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:19.823
See you at school tomorrow.

01:02:21.283 --> 01:02:22.618
Good night.

01:02:22.618 --> 01:02:24.244
We're back!

01:02:25.579 --> 01:02:27.748
What's up, Cal?

01:02:27.748 --> 01:02:29.249
It's so
good to see you!

01:02:29.249 --> 01:02:31.376
You too.

01:02:31.376 --> 01:02:33.003
Calvin was here?

01:02:33.003 --> 01:02:33.921
Yeah.

01:02:34.963 --> 01:02:36.757
You ready for bed?

01:02:36.757 --> 01:02:39.593
No, I gotta
hear all the stories.

01:02:39.593 --> 01:02:40.844
All the stories?

01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:42.679
Yeah,
every single story,

01:02:42.679 --> 01:02:44.389
and that thing about Daniel

01:02:44.389 --> 01:02:48.143
and the hungry beaver
named Larry, part two.

01:02:56.944 --> 01:02:57.903
There she is!

01:02:59.947 --> 01:03:01.615
Heather, what's going on?

01:03:01.615 --> 01:03:04.701
OMG, that's right, you
played hooky on Friday.

01:03:04.701 --> 01:03:05.452
We won.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.623
New York City, here we come.

01:03:09.623 --> 01:03:11.500
Heather, why would
you turn this in?

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:12.376
'Cause that was the plan?

01:03:12.376 --> 01:03:13.126
What?

01:03:14.962 --> 01:03:15.963
Calvin.

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:20.968
Calvin, I'm sorry.

01:03:20.968 --> 01:03:22.928
Calvin, I can
explain, I promise.

01:03:22.928 --> 01:03:25.347
Calvin, can you wait?

01:03:25.347 --> 01:03:26.890
Calvin, stop.

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:27.850
Calvin, wait, serious-

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:29.810
Was it before or after?

01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:31.770
What do you mean?

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:35.107
Did you start writing that
paper before or after our trip?

01:03:35.107 --> 01:03:36.441
Before-

01:03:36.441 --> 01:03:37.359
Was it before or
after you told me

01:03:37.359 --> 01:03:38.861
you wanted to be my friend?

01:03:38.861 --> 01:03:40.237
Before.

01:03:40.237 --> 01:03:43.615
Was it before or after
you told me you liked me?

01:03:43.615 --> 01:03:44.366
Before.

01:03:46.243 --> 01:03:48.036
So all of that

01:03:48.036 --> 01:03:51.874
was just to get out of
this stupid town, right?

01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:55.169
Calvin, I didn't know
you like I know you now.

01:03:55.169 --> 01:03:56.461
Yeah well, my mom knew me too,

01:03:56.461 --> 01:03:57.921
and that is exactly
what she did.

01:03:57.921 --> 01:03:59.298
I wouldn't do that.

01:03:59.298 --> 01:04:01.008
Oh hey, Calvin,
any word from E.T.

01:04:01.008 --> 01:04:02.301
on how Mom and Dad are doing?

01:04:02.301 --> 01:04:03.260
I heard probing was a thing.

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:04.803
That's not true.

01:04:04.803 --> 01:04:05.721
Yes, it is.

01:04:05.721 --> 01:04:06.722
I saw it on the SYFY channel.

01:04:06.722 --> 01:04:08.015
No, his mom wasn't abducted.

01:04:08.015 --> 01:04:10.309
We found her this
weekend in Montana.

01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:11.059
Oh.

01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:15.022
So she just ran out?

01:04:15.022 --> 01:04:15.939
No, I mean-

01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:17.024
Well, you were right, Itsy.

01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:18.358
Isn't that what you said?

01:04:18.358 --> 01:04:21.778
You said that he was so
sad and pathetic, right?

01:04:23.113 --> 01:04:25.699
Aww, look, he's so sad now.

01:04:25.699 --> 01:04:26.909
Hey, maybe Mommy
will kiss it better

01:04:26.909 --> 01:04:28.243
if she hasn't run off again.

01:04:28.243 --> 01:04:29.328
What is wrong with you?

01:04:29.328 --> 01:04:30.245
No!

01:04:30.245 --> 01:04:30.913
You're such a jerk, Heather!

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:33.999
Get off me!

01:04:33.999 --> 01:04:36.293
Fight,
fight, fight!

01:04:36.293 --> 01:04:37.586
Come at me, you mongrels!

01:04:37.586 --> 01:04:38.754
You're not ready!

01:04:38.754 --> 01:04:40.005
I'm built different!

01:04:42.674 --> 01:04:43.550
That's my sister!

01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:44.468
Get off me!

01:04:44.468 --> 01:04:45.761
Help me!

01:04:45.761 --> 01:04:46.887
I've been waiting a
long time to do this!

01:04:48.472 --> 01:04:50.349
So I take one out, give
the ol'

01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:52.476
and then the other one
comes at me like aahh,

01:04:52.476 --> 01:04:53.977
and then I'm like, so I'm
like "Today's my lucky day."

01:04:55.479 --> 01:04:57.231
Okay, okay, we get it, honey.

01:04:57.231 --> 01:04:58.482
I mean, we're just lucky

01:04:58.482 --> 01:04:59.775
they didn't suspend
the both of you.

01:04:59.775 --> 01:05:01.235
Yeah, speaking of which,

01:05:01.235 --> 01:05:04.238
I was thinking we ground
you guys for like, 2 days.

01:05:04.238 --> 01:05:06.573
Oh, our first grounding.

01:05:06.573 --> 01:05:07.866
How fun.

01:05:07.866 --> 01:05:10.452
We can make you guys
pull weeds, or something.

01:05:10.452 --> 01:05:12.037
Sand the banisters?

01:05:12.037 --> 01:05:14.206
I've got some ottomans that
need to be reupholstered.

01:05:14.206 --> 01:05:15.207
You can do that, too.

01:05:15.207 --> 01:05:16.792
Ooh, exciting.

01:05:16.792 --> 01:05:19.419
I have no clue
what that means, whatsoever.

01:05:25.926 --> 01:05:29.930
Hey, you remember that
you're grounded, right?

01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:31.682
Just be back before dinner.

01:05:31.682 --> 01:05:32.933

What's wrong?

01:06:42.377 --> 01:06:43.629
Dinner.

01:06:43.629 --> 01:06:45.589
You can just leave it.

01:06:47.674 --> 01:06:48.926
These from Calvin's shed?

01:06:48.926 --> 01:06:51.136
Yeah, he was
tracking this comet,

01:06:51.136 --> 01:06:53.013
the one he believed that the UFO

01:06:53.013 --> 01:06:55.891
that took his parents
were following.

01:06:55.891 --> 01:06:57.809
'Til I blew it all up.

01:06:57.809 --> 01:06:59.561
That was pretty uncool of you.

01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:00.562
But he still deserved to know

01:07:00.562 --> 01:07:02.731
that his mom was
still out there,

01:07:02.731 --> 01:07:04.942
even if she was a total jerk.

01:07:06.693 --> 01:07:07.903
What are these?

01:07:07.903 --> 01:07:11.073
Those were taken the
night his parents left,

01:07:11.073 --> 01:07:14.535
and he didn't have a way
to develop them, so I did.

01:07:14.535 --> 01:07:16.245
What this, though?

01:07:16.245 --> 01:07:17.538
I just told you.

01:07:17.538 --> 01:07:20.123
No, this, right here.

01:07:20.123 --> 01:07:21.124
Is that a UFO?

01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:22.251
That's a UFO?

01:07:22.251 --> 01:07:23.377
Shh!

01:07:25.128 --> 01:07:26.213
It's tonight.

01:07:26.213 --> 01:07:27.548
Huh?

01:07:27.548 --> 01:07:28.757
That's why he's
not at the shed.

01:07:28.757 --> 01:07:30.884
Jesper's Comet
flies over tonight!

01:07:30.884 --> 01:07:33.011
How many times do I
have to say orienteering

01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:34.972
before you listen to me?

01:07:36.306 --> 01:07:39.893
With these coordinates
measuring for travel time,

01:07:39.893 --> 01:07:43.063
huh, the comet path
should be right here,

01:07:43.063 --> 01:07:46.233
but it looks like he mixed up
the 1/3 and 1/4 mile marker

01:07:46.233 --> 01:07:49.111
and went to a spot
2 miles south.

01:07:49.111 --> 01:07:51.113
You are a genius!

01:07:51.113 --> 01:07:52.531
Freakin' fractions.

01:07:52.531 --> 01:07:53.866
Oh, man.

01:07:53.866 --> 01:07:56.034
Unless we tell him,
he's gonna miss the comet.

01:07:56.034 --> 01:07:57.244
You forget, we're grounded.

01:07:57.244 --> 01:07:59.997
You forget that
I'm very clever.

01:08:01.874 --> 01:08:02.916
Hello, Mother and Father.

01:08:02.916 --> 01:08:06.753
I'm just going to the
kitchen for sustenance.

01:08:08.881 --> 01:08:09.882
Oh, no!

01:08:09.882 --> 01:08:11.133
I've broken something.

01:08:11.133 --> 01:08:13.760
Gasp! I think it's
Mother's favorite tea mug!

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.262
Better not be!

01:08:15.262 --> 01:08:16.847
Never mind.

01:08:16.847 --> 01:08:18.015
I think it's Dad's entire
shot glass collection

01:08:18.015 --> 01:08:19.641
from Venezuela.

01:08:19.641 --> 01:08:21.935
If you mean Nicaragua,
I'm gonna be really upset.

01:08:33.947 --> 01:08:36.200
Hold it right there, missy.

01:08:37.743 --> 01:08:39.536
I'm guessing your brother
orchestrated that whole thing

01:08:39.536 --> 01:08:42.372
as a distraction so
you could sneak out?

01:08:42.372 --> 01:08:43.707
Mm hm.

01:08:43.707 --> 01:08:44.917
And you're going
to go find Calvin?

01:08:44.917 --> 01:08:45.918
Mm hm.

01:08:49.046 --> 01:08:51.924
Then you should
probably take my car.

01:08:51.924 --> 01:08:54.259
Wait, you'll need this.

01:08:54.259 --> 01:08:55.802
It's dark out there.

01:08:56.803 --> 01:08:58.764
You guys are okay with this?

01:08:58.764 --> 01:09:01.934
Ah, you can be
grounded some other time.

01:09:01.934 --> 01:09:04.895
Maybe next Thursday.

01:09:09.566 --> 01:09:10.859
Go get 'em, kiddo.

01:09:10.859 --> 01:09:11.652

Calvin, I am so sorry
about everything.

01:10:27.978 --> 01:10:29.479
I shouldn't have written
that article about you,

01:10:29.479 --> 01:10:30.772
and I shouldn't have
said those things,

01:10:30.772 --> 01:10:32.065

01:10:35.903 --> 01:10:37.237
And I'm sorry, I was
just focused on trying

01:10:37.237 --> 01:10:38.197
to get back to my old life,
so I was self-centered,

01:10:38.197 --> 01:10:39.239
and selfish, and a jerk!

01:10:39.239 --> 01:10:39.948
Itsy.

01:10:41.992 --> 01:10:42.993
You're right.

01:10:44.369 --> 01:10:45.913
You don't have to
agree that quickly.

01:10:45.913 --> 01:10:49.041
No, no, what I
mean is I've realized

01:10:50.584 --> 01:10:53.045
I've spent so much time thinking
about leaving this planet,

01:10:53.045 --> 01:10:56.006
I haven't thought about
what I'd do if I stayed.

01:10:56.006 --> 01:10:58.217
So I came here to say goodbye.

01:10:58.217 --> 01:11:00.552

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:07.017

he's coming back for me,

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.896
or that UFOs exist-

01:11:10.896 --> 01:11:12.648
No, but they do exist!

01:11:12.648 --> 01:11:14.233
Calvin, you were
right about the UFOs,

01:11:14.233 --> 01:11:15.776
but you were wrong
about the location.

01:11:15.776 --> 01:11:17.945
We're supposed to be
two miles that way.

01:11:17.945 --> 01:11:19.154
You might be a genius,

01:11:19.154 --> 01:11:20.948
but you're still
horrible at fractions.

01:11:22.824 --> 01:11:23.784
I was right?

01:11:23.784 --> 01:11:24.785
You were right.

01:11:24.785 --> 01:11:25.827
My dad was abducted by aliens?

01:11:25.827 --> 01:11:28.872

abducted by aliens!

01:11:28.872 --> 01:11:30.165

01:11:30.165 --> 01:11:31.083

01:13:05.302 --> 01:13:06.178
I'm okay.

01:13:09.598 --> 01:13:11.642
I think I'm finally okay.

01:13:14.186 --> 01:13:17.356
I've got everything
I need right here.

01:13:18.982 --> 01:13:20.150
Let's go home.

01:13:56.311 --> 01:13:57.604
Calvin, look.

01:14:12.369 --> 01:14:13.662
Pardon?

01:14:16.206 --> 01:14:18.333
Nice to meet you, buddy.

01:14:20.002 --> 01:14:23.797
Oh, yeah, it's nice
to meet you too, buddy.

01:14:27.342 --> 01:14:28.093
Calvin?

01:14:34.892 --> 01:14:35.642
Dad?

01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:40.772
Dad!

01:14:55.078 --> 01:14:56.163
Oh, Calvin.

01:14:57.039 --> 01:14:58.498
I can't believe you're here.

01:14:58.498 --> 01:14:59.791
Me?

01:14:59.791 --> 01:15:00.959
I can't believe
that you're here.

01:15:00.959 --> 01:15:01.877
And look at you.

01:15:01.877 --> 01:15:03.003
You're huge!

01:15:03.003 --> 01:15:03.921
Look at you!

01:15:03.921 --> 01:15:06.131
You look, the exact same.

01:15:06.131 --> 01:15:07.716
Yeah, it's crazy, right?

01:15:07.716 --> 01:15:09.843
Yeah, there's something
about chasing Jesper's Comet

01:15:09.843 --> 01:15:11.345
that stops you from aging.

01:15:11.345 --> 01:15:14.306
You know, I've been up
in space for 109 years.

01:15:14.306 --> 01:15:17.684
Wait, so how many earth years
have passed since I left?

01:15:17.684 --> 01:15:19.436
You've been gone
for 10 years, Dad.

01:15:19.436 --> 01:15:22.064
Oh, I'm so sorry, son.

01:15:22.064 --> 01:15:24.858
Look, I've been trying to reach
you since the moment I left.

01:15:24.858 --> 01:15:27.945
Did you get my message
about pancakes?

01:15:27.945 --> 01:15:29.947
I knew that was you.

01:15:29.947 --> 01:15:31.865
Well, I'm here now.

01:15:36.828 --> 01:15:38.539
Calvin?

01:15:42.042 --> 01:15:43.126
Who's this?

01:15:43.126 --> 01:15:44.253
Hi, I'm Itsy.

01:15:44.253 --> 01:15:45.045
Oh, hi, Itsy.

01:15:45.045 --> 01:15:47.881
I'm Cyrus, Calvin's dad.

01:15:47.881 --> 01:15:49.716
Are you, uh...

01:15:49.716 --> 01:15:51.885
Well, it's um...

01:15:51.885 --> 01:15:53.428
I'm his girlfriend.

01:15:53.428 --> 01:15:55.681
I see, all right.

01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:56.974
Hmm.

01:15:56.974 --> 01:15:58.851
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, Itsy.

01:15:58.851 --> 01:16:00.477
Nice to meet buddy.

01:16:04.857 --> 01:16:06.567
Wait, Dad, your hair.

01:16:06.567 --> 01:16:07.734
You're getting older.

01:16:07.734 --> 01:16:09.069
Oh no.

01:16:09.069 --> 01:16:10.863
I was afraid this would happen.

01:16:10.863 --> 01:16:11.780
What's going on?

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:13.198
Time is catching up to me.

01:16:13.198 --> 01:16:14.992
That 109 years I spent in space

01:16:14.992 --> 01:16:18.036
must be affecting
me all at once.

01:16:27.796 --> 01:16:29.131
Okay.

01:16:29.131 --> 01:16:30.299
What are they saying?

01:16:30.299 --> 01:16:32.801
Well, the bad news is uh...

01:16:34.303 --> 01:16:35.554
You can't stay.

01:16:35.554 --> 01:16:36.388
Well, no.

01:16:36.388 --> 01:16:37.723
I can.

01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:39.349
I've come all this
way to see you.

01:16:39.349 --> 01:16:40.684
I'm staying here.

01:16:40.684 --> 01:16:44.062
Dad, you've aged 20
years in five minutes.

01:16:44.062 --> 01:16:47.691
Another 15 and you'll have
aged 60 years and probably die.

01:16:47.691 --> 01:16:49.026
You need to go.

01:16:49.026 --> 01:16:50.068
All right.

01:16:50.068 --> 01:16:51.695
Give me a second.

01:16:59.912 --> 01:17:01.830
Okay, great news.

01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:03.624
They said that you
guys can come with us.

01:17:03.624 --> 01:17:05.834
Yeah, but we need to
leave ASAP, all right.

01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:08.253
These guys are kind of obsessed
with chasing Jesper's Comet

01:17:08.253 --> 01:17:10.547
because they think the tail
tastes like cotton candy.

01:17:10.547 --> 01:17:12.341
By the way, it's very good.

01:17:12.341 --> 01:17:13.217
Cotton candy?

01:17:13.217 --> 01:17:14.718
Yeah.

01:17:14.718 --> 01:17:15.969
But the tails of
comets are mostly made up

01:17:15.969 --> 01:17:17.971
of ionized gases and
metallic microparticles.

01:17:17.971 --> 01:17:19.932
Oh, my sweet, sweet boy.

01:17:19.932 --> 01:17:22.434
There's so much
for you to learn.

01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:25.812
Oh, there's the departure bell.

01:17:25.812 --> 01:17:26.605
Come on, let's go.

01:17:26.605 --> 01:17:27.648
We better go.

01:17:29.233 --> 01:17:29.983
Calvin.

01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:32.945
I can't leave.

01:17:32.945 --> 01:17:34.196
My family's here.

01:17:37.449 --> 01:17:38.534
But my dad.

01:17:40.202 --> 01:17:40.994
I know.

01:17:48.544 --> 01:17:49.294
You go.

01:17:52.756 --> 01:17:53.507
Calvin?

01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:03.600
Come on.

01:18:06.311 --> 01:18:07.479
Dad, I, I...

01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:11.191
Yeah, it's okay.

01:18:11.191 --> 01:18:12.860
I understand.

01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:17.573
Just know I'll be up
there looking down on you.

01:18:17.573 --> 01:18:20.325
Oh, I'm so proud of you, Son.

01:18:20.325 --> 01:18:21.702
So proud of you.

01:18:31.128 --> 01:18:32.796
Love you, kiddo.

01:18:32.796 --> 01:18:34.715
Love you, too, Dad.

01:18:41.722 --> 01:18:43.682
And hey, the
comet will be making

01:18:43.682 --> 01:18:46.018
its way back around to
Earth every 10 years.

01:18:46.018 --> 01:18:48.103
Maybe one day you guys
will change your minds

01:18:48.103 --> 01:18:49.938
and wanna come with us.

01:19:17.841 --> 01:19:18.884
Wait, look.

01:19:21.011 --> 01:19:22.763
Make a wish, Calvin.

01:19:26.016 --> 01:19:28.769
Well, um, if now
is a good time.

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.981
I'd like to ask for
your consent to-

01:19:35.526 --> 01:19:36.276
Wow.

01:19:37.152 --> 01:19:38.946
What?

01:19:38.946 --> 01:19:42.449

my wish to come true so soon.
