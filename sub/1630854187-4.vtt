03:33.880 --> 03:36.400
When you're young,
black and from the hood,

03:36.480 --> 03:39.320
fear is just one of those things
you're taught never to show a man.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.080
It makes you weak, we're told,
makes you a target.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.840
So what else can you do?

03:46.920 --> 03:48.560
You learn to hide it,

03:48.640 --> 03:51.040
disguise it by wrapping it up
in a certain mannerism,

03:51.120 --> 03:53.720
like anger or aggression.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.000
That way no one could tell
it was ever there,

04:04.000 --> 04:05.680
Not because you wanted to,

04:05.760 --> 04:08.560
but because you had to, to survive.

04:10.040 --> 04:13.240
And you know what? Most outsiders
won't even get it, you know?

04:13.320 --> 04:15.880
Like, like the way we are around here.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.240
The way we look.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.440
Our style, chains, iced out,

04:21.520 --> 04:24.720
sometimes completely matching from head
to toe in designers, even when we're broke

04:24.800 --> 04:26.440
or, like, the rent is due.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.560
It's like it's somewhat
strange to them, like,

04:30.640 --> 04:34.360
our language, like, the way we talk,
communicate with each other,

04:34.440 --> 04:38.760
loud, animated at times, aggressive even.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.360
But let me try and explain.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.320
See most of us, like,
we haven't come from much.

04:45.360 --> 04:49.520
We're the children of immigrants,
born into struggle in strange lands.

04:50.480 --> 04:54.480
We grew up not quite fitting in,
confused, torn between cultures,

04:54.560 --> 04:56.880
like, neither one
really accepting us, so...

04:56.920 --> 04:58.720
so we created our own.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.680
We wear our hoodies up as a...

05:00.760 --> 05:04.160
like a fuck you to a society that never
really accepted us in the first place.

05:04.240 --> 05:07.360
It's kind of like our uniform, like,
it represents our mindset kinda.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.800
Our words and dialect
reflect the environment

05:11.920 --> 05:15.440
in which we've been raised,
like, harsh and unforgiving.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.880
Like, we dress the way we do,
in designers, with gold in our mouths

05:19.920 --> 05:23.320
and diamonds around our necks,
wearing expensive watches on our wrists,

05:23.360 --> 05:25.360
like, just to feel important,

05:25.440 --> 05:27.600
just to feel some sort of worth
in a society

05:27.680 --> 05:29.680
that's forever telling us
that we're worthless.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.840
There's no rocket science to it, man.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.080
It's just simple cause and effect,
I guess.

05:37.360 --> 05:40.680
So, like I said, like,
we didn't come from much.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.640
So every time we step out,
it's like a celebration for us,

05:43.720 --> 05:45.680
look how far we've come,

05:45.760 --> 05:48.320
but yet a reminder of how far
we still have left to go.

Ain't no discussion about it.

16:57.200 --> 17:01.000
Anyway, they ain't happy with me,
just letting you know.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.520
And Miss Hampton keeps asking me
when's Mum gonna come in.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.400
I've warned you about this
already, bro, man.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.960
You're spending
too much time online, bruv.

17:10.080 --> 17:12.320
[kisses teeth]
Let me fix your tie as well, man.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.280
Always got this shit messed up.

17:14.320 --> 17:17.040
Give your schoolteachers my number, man.

17:17.080 --> 17:18.400
It's like you don't listen, bruv.

17:18.480 --> 17:21.520
I do listen,
but you're only 17 years old Marcus,

17:21.560 --> 17:23.920
and, well, I think they'll notice
you're not my mum.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.720
You're idiot, bruv.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.280
Listen, man,
just tell them Mum's busy, man,

17:28.320 --> 17:30.640
or she's sick or something,
she can't come.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.480
Furthermore, get better grades

17:32.560 --> 17:34.640
and we won't be having
this discussion in the first place.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.720
Yeah, either that or we let them know

17:37.800 --> 17:39.680
-my mum's a drug head on gold dust.
-What?

17:40.520 --> 17:42.400
What did you just say?

17:43.240 --> 17:44.760
What did you just say, bruv?

17:45.560 --> 17:49.480
Huh? Don't let me ever
hear you say that again, ever!

17:49.560 --> 17:51.440
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?

17:52.200 --> 17:54.320
Mum ain't no drug head, do you understand?

17:57.320 --> 17:58.560
[kisses teeth]

18:02.440 --> 18:03.560
Look, bro.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.880
Mum's just sick, alright?

18:06.960 --> 18:09.760
We've gotta look after her, man.
Me and you, bro.

18:10.560 --> 18:13.000
If we don't look out for each other
then no one's gonna look out for us.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.760
Who's gonna look out for us, bro?

18:20.040 --> 18:20.960
[kisses teeth]

18:22.440 --> 18:24.520
I can't even come get you later on,
you know?

18:24.560 --> 18:25.880
What, why?

18:25.960 --> 18:27.480
I've gotta look for a job, innit?

18:27.560 --> 18:29.520
[foreboding music]

18:29.560 --> 18:32.280
Listen, make sure you head home
straight after school, innit?

18:32.320 --> 18:33.760
No hanging around, nothing.

18:42.440 --> 18:45.760
[laughter] Yo, hey, look who it is, blud.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.560
-Oh, bro.
-Marcus.

18:48.680 --> 18:49.880
Wagwan, fam?

18:50.960 --> 18:55.080
Where you been at, blud?
Moving like some civilian now?

18:55.200 --> 18:56.520
Are you too good for the gang?

18:57.320 --> 18:59.320
Nah, man. Just been too busy.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.000
You know how it gets.
What's the mandem on?

19:01.920 --> 19:04.200
You know what we're on, blud.
We're out here, innit?

19:04.280 --> 19:06.400
Business as usual, you get me,

19:06.480 --> 19:08.640
dropping tings off, picking tings up.

19:08.720 --> 19:10.800
What are you on though? You rolling?

19:11.320 --> 19:12.800
I'm just looking for a fucking job, fam.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.080
[laughter]

19:15.200 --> 19:16.880
He saying job, fam?

19:16.960 --> 19:18.720
What kind of job are you getting, blud?

19:18.800 --> 19:21.200
No one ain't hiring you.
You're from the hood, fam.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.760
What you gonna be doing,
flipping burgers, fam?

19:25.800 --> 19:27.880
Well, I guess that's it, innit, like?

19:27.960 --> 19:30.640
If it's a burger ting,
it's a burger ting, innit?

19:30.720 --> 19:32.480
At the end of the day, money's money, man,

19:32.560 --> 19:34.160
and I need that right now.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.080
That's not no money, blud.

19:36.160 --> 19:40.320
You need to be making that gold dust
money, you get me? The proper money.

19:40.440 --> 19:41.960
Shining, cuz.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.560
You know, man, you know what's going on.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.720
Yo, you know what though, blud?
You've changed, fam.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.720
What's going on, man?
You're acting different, blud.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.520
Nah, man. Change ain't always a bad thing.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.560
See your lickle brother
the other day though. He's getting big.

19:55.680 --> 19:58.640
Might have to start make him
rolling with the mandem now, you get me?

19:59.480 --> 20:01.880
Take your place in the gang, you feel me?

20:04.200 --> 20:07.200
Come on, man. Check you lot later, man.

20:07.280 --> 20:10.640
Yeah? Say nothing, man. Roll easy, innit?

20:11.560 --> 20:13.240
[foreboding music]

20:13.320 --> 20:15.440
[indistinct chatter]

20:19.880 --> 20:21.800
[Vivian laughing]

20:21.880 --> 20:24.000
I love you for this, man.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.560
Bare food.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.720
-Love you for this, man.
-It's something amazing.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.880
-I really fucking love you!
-Yeah?

20:54.480 --> 20:55.720
Get the fuck out!

20:56.520 --> 20:57.920
I said get out!

20:58.000 --> 20:59.440
Yeah, ah...

20:59.520 --> 21:02.280
What the fuck? Darren, Darren,
Darren, where you going?

21:02.320 --> 21:05.320

21:14.400 --> 21:17.200
So what? You ain't got
no respect for us no more, huh?

21:17.280 --> 21:20.440
You forget that
me and Dan live here too, huh?

21:20.520 --> 21:22.560
Letting drugheads into the yard now, yeah?

21:22.640 --> 21:24.080
Shut up, man!

21:24.800 --> 21:26.920
I'll do what the fuck I like.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.680
Why you always
fucking complaining, man, huh?

21:29.760 --> 21:32.800
I can let whoever the fuck I like
in my house!

21:32.920 --> 21:34.160
What do you mean it's your house?

21:34.240 --> 21:36.080
Are you forgetting that we live here
as well, huh?

21:36.160 --> 21:37.960
Why the fuck we gotta keep
seeing this shit, man?

21:38.040 --> 21:39.320
You ain't giving me no money, are you?

21:40.520 --> 21:41.560
Huh?

21:42.200 --> 21:44.200
So what the fuck do you expect?

21:45.640 --> 21:48.160
What'd I tell you about leaving this shit
here? What if Dan saw that, huh?

21:48.240 --> 21:51.000
No, no! Marcus! Please don't... Please!

21:51.080 --> 21:52.680
Get off me! Get off!

23:11.120 --> 23:12.200
[sighs]

23:13.560 --> 23:15.360
Jeez, man. [kisses teeth]

23:15.440 --> 23:16.600
You done it again!

23:17.640 --> 23:19.360
[kisses teeth] You let him in, innit?

23:20.280 --> 23:23.760
He was banging on the door
and I... I got scared.

23:23.840 --> 23:27.320
He said he was a friend of Mum's,
and I froze again, Marcus.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.640
You know I get scared
when I hear the door--

23:28.720 --> 23:30.960
What do you mean you get scared?
Scared for what?

23:31.040 --> 23:33.000
What did I tell you to do when someone
bangs on the door like that

23:33.080 --> 23:35.360
and I'm not here, huh?
What did I tell you?

23:35.880 --> 23:37.000
Don't open it.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.040
Exactly. And if they keep banging,

23:39.120 --> 23:41.560
you get the bat by the door
and you call me!

23:41.640 --> 23:42.680
I'm sorry.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.640
[kisses teeth]

23:50.840 --> 23:53.920
Nah, man, forget about it still,
don't worry about it.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.040
[kisses teeth] It's not your fault.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.480
It's just bringing back mad memories,

24:01.560 --> 24:03.800
like when my dad used to come home
drunk and stuff,

24:03.880 --> 24:06.160
and then my mum, the police...

24:07.520 --> 24:09.120
We've both seen a lot from young.

24:11.560 --> 24:15.040
Look, Dan,
I need you to be stronger for me, bro.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.760
You need to be brave now.

24:16.840 --> 24:18.960
Remember what I told you you are?

24:19.040 --> 24:21.400
What are you when I'm not here?
What are you?

24:21.480 --> 24:22.960
The man of the house.

24:23.040 --> 24:25.280
Exactly. You're in charge.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.280
You know what used to help me?

24:29.080 --> 24:31.600
Like, when I used to get anxiety
when I was younger and that.

24:32.840 --> 24:35.080
I'd just take a deep breath,

24:35.160 --> 24:38.200
I'd clench my fists like this,
real tight, look.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.960
I'd poke my chest out

24:41.040 --> 24:44.760
and I'd just imagine that one bang
would just knock a man's head off clean.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.880
Boom! You see that. [chuckles]

24:52.160 --> 24:55.800
Hmm... Put your hand down.

24:55.880 --> 24:58.400
Scrap the mean face as well, bro,
it's not working.

24:58.480 --> 25:00.040
I know. It's rubbish, innit?

25:00.120 --> 25:02.320
Yeah, bro, man. [laughs]

25:02.400 --> 25:03.520
Look, take this.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.520
Go wash it in the sink
with some warm water and soap.

25:08.600 --> 25:11.240
-It should get rid of it, alright?
-Alright.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.280
Cool.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.720
I'll be back in a bit, yeah?

25:16.800 --> 25:18.360
Make sure you look after Mum for me.

25:21.760 --> 25:25.360

with me no matter what, it's that smell.

[narrator] Life is all about choices,

55:59.920 --> 56:01.680
from one day to the next.

56:04.040 --> 56:06.280
And there's a shit load
of them to choose from too.

56:08.320 --> 56:09.520
I mean, look, think about it.

56:10.280 --> 56:12.080
We get to choose the friends
we keep around us,

56:12.160 --> 56:14.360
like, the progressive ones,

56:14.440 --> 56:17.400
inspiring us to do better,
live a better life.

56:18.800 --> 56:23.040
Or the toxic ones, like the negative ones,
holding us back, dragging us down.

56:24.080 --> 56:26.640
I mean, we even get to choose
the lifestyles we lead, right?

56:26.720 --> 56:29.440
Our habits, like, whether good or bad.

56:29.520 --> 56:31.240
We choose our attitude from day to day,

56:31.960 --> 56:34.720
whether it's a positive one
or a not so positive one.

56:35.640 --> 56:38.600
But see, there is one thing, of course,
that we don't get to choose...

56:38.680 --> 56:39.880
That's my sister, still.

56:40.680 --> 56:42.200
And that thing is our family.

56:44.280 --> 56:46.120
I've got something to tell you.

56:46.200 --> 56:48.360
And that's where one's loyalties
will always lie.
