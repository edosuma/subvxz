00:58.050 --> 00:59.760
It is good to see you, my friend.

01:01.890 --> 01:05.770
I'm greatly encouraged
by recent talks with His Holiness.

01:05.850 --> 01:08.610
-He's most eager for your arrival.
-My arrival?

01:08.690 --> 01:10.900
Oh, yes. He sees you
as much more than a mere ambassador.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.440
Ah!

01:54.280 --> 01:56.240
The barbarians.

01:59.030 --> 02:00.200
Welcome.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.790
Eight keshig dead.

04:53.870 --> 04:55.290
And ten horses.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.460
My son's horses?

04:59.590 --> 05:01.880
No sign of Jingim or Ahmad.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.130
How close to Karakorum?

05:05.220 --> 05:07.050
Close enough.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.100
Kaidu.

05:14.730 --> 05:16.310
Who else?

05:17.230 --> 05:18.940
To harm my sons...

05:20.190 --> 05:21.480
An act of war.

05:26.110 --> 05:28.410
We ride for Karakorum.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.050
You believe they're still alive.

05:44.130 --> 05:47.010
If Kaidu were to kill my sons,

05:47.090 --> 05:49.930
he would have made a display of it.

05:50.010 --> 05:51.140
Why?

05:53.100 --> 05:54.600
Why do this?

05:55.560 --> 05:59.440
Power games of men
come hand-in-hand with an election.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.900
-You're certain?
-Certain what?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.490
Certain this is not somehow...

06:10.120 --> 06:11.280
our fault?

06:12.370 --> 06:13.700
Our fault?

06:16.290 --> 06:18.710
Are we somehow
being punished for what we did?

06:21.130 --> 06:23.840
Does my husband
bear the brunt of God's anger

06:23.920 --> 06:27.970
-for sins he doesn't even know?
-You think life is that simple, child?

06:31.260 --> 06:33.180
We will find them.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.770
You're warm.
Do you bleed?

06:44.650 --> 06:46.690
-No.
-Good.

06:46.780 --> 06:49.200
Your female instinct,
what does it tell you?

06:49.280 --> 06:50.950
I don't have one.

06:51.030 --> 06:52.530
Oh...

06:53.830 --> 06:56.330
Of course you do.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.830
It just wants nurturing.

07:07.130 --> 07:11.050
Get out, take some air.
It will do you good.

07:33.950 --> 07:35.490
- Hello?

07:36.490 --> 07:38.910
...Hello?

08:25.630 --> 08:26.920
What did you do?

08:29.130 --> 08:30.630
Word from our scouts.

08:31.260 --> 08:34.840
The Khan and his army
are traveling to Karakorum.

08:36.510 --> 08:38.010
His sons are missing.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.470
What did you do?

08:42.100 --> 08:44.850
What you told us to do.
We sent a message.

08:44.940 --> 08:47.730
You made war against my brothers?

08:47.820 --> 08:50.070
-If I'd told you, you would've stopped me.
-You're damn right.

08:51.190 --> 08:54.910
- What else?
- I killed their horses.

08:56.070 --> 08:57.080
You killed them?

08:57.160 --> 09:01.080
The Khan's sons aren't capable
of walking half a day to a way station?

09:01.160 --> 09:05.500
Then why, Orus,
have they not arrived at a way station?

09:09.170 --> 09:10.960
The Vice Regent's horse...

09:12.920 --> 09:14.550
fell on his leg.

09:17.470 --> 09:18.760
And you left them there.

09:36.820 --> 09:38.990
I thought you'd left me.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.540
Well, I said I was coming back.

09:44.790 --> 09:46.830
- You did?

09:50.290 --> 09:52.170
Yes, you did.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.550
If you'd left me,
you could have saved yourself.

09:57.340 --> 09:59.350
We stay together.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.520
They're out there, Ahmad, looking for us.

10:06.730 --> 10:08.270
And they will find us.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.420
If I die...

10:32.500 --> 10:33.800
will you forgive my offenses?

10:33.880 --> 10:37.180
-Stop it. You're not dying.
-I'm going to.

10:37.260 --> 10:39.260
We're all going to.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.390
When, where, and how,
now they are the questions.

10:45.810 --> 10:47.940
- Covered in opium and sweat, maybe.

10:49.310 --> 10:50.940
Good way to go.

10:53.190 --> 10:54.900
But not in a place like this.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.830
Although, it... it would be fitting.

11:04.290 --> 11:07.660
A humble end for a humble beginning.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.210
Just as when you were a boy...

11:11.120 --> 11:14.000
your destiny is to be saved.

11:19.010 --> 11:20.590
Fox, anyone?

11:57.510 --> 11:59.260
Where is Batbayer?

12:00.090 --> 12:04.140
He is... not here, Miss...
Uh, Princess.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.980
Look at me.
Take a breath.

12:14.190 --> 12:16.610
Speak plainly.

12:16.690 --> 12:18.690
Where is he?

12:24.110 --> 12:26.030
He's dead.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.500
They found his body the other night.
Near the river.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.070
The whole of your army
can be here within a week.

13:03.150 --> 13:06.410
Unless Kaidu has a death wish,
he will surrender Jingim and Ahmad.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.340
Mmm.

13:25.050 --> 13:26.800
The Goyo plant.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.390
It grows heavily in this region.

13:30.220 --> 13:33.980
More enemies have fallen
to its poison than any sword.

13:43.780 --> 13:45.070
Pick some for Kaidu.

14:06.630 --> 14:08.010
Where are my sons?

14:09.640 --> 14:11.220
They are not in the capital.

14:17.810 --> 14:19.650
Search all you like.

14:20.440 --> 14:23.150
Your other son will lead.

14:23.980 --> 14:25.740
Go with him.

14:46.130 --> 14:48.970
If my brothers were here, I'd know.

14:49.050 --> 14:51.800
-Did you know they were attacked?
-No.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.390
So perhaps they could be here,
and you might not know.

14:55.470 --> 14:59.190
I saw Kaidu's reaction
when he received word.

14:59.270 --> 15:01.650
He had no idea
Jingim and Ahmad were missing.

15:01.730 --> 15:03.360
And if they were prisoners,

15:03.440 --> 15:06.490
would we be foolish enough
to keep them within the walls?

15:07.400 --> 15:08.570
"We"?

15:14.660 --> 15:16.750
Much has changed.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.750
Has the Khan spoken of me?

15:22.840 --> 15:26.300
He might have preferred you'd lost
that wrestling match with Khutulun.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.010
Do you?

15:32.090 --> 15:33.760
This is a waste of time.

15:39.310 --> 15:40.690
Yours.

15:42.310 --> 15:46.070
-I didn't think bloodshed your aim.
-It is not.

15:46.150 --> 15:48.150
Or civil war.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.740
Any more than it was for you...

15:50.820 --> 15:52.950
when you sent back those eight heads.

15:53.490 --> 15:55.870
Those heads didn't belong to your sons.

15:56.910 --> 15:57.910
No.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.580
You took those
at your war against the wall.

16:15.390 --> 16:17.140
Bow to your Khan.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.310
I take blame for nothing.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.070
Other than raising an idiot.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.610
-He acted on his own?
-Entirely.

16:35.410 --> 16:36.950
But you sanctioned the raid?

16:38.370 --> 16:40.830
-Mmm.
-I give you my word.

16:40.910 --> 16:45.540
Should your sons not be returned to you,
you may take mine to do with as you wish.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.670
Now let's focus on what matters.

16:48.750 --> 16:50.590
Ahmad was injured.

16:50.670 --> 16:53.220
My best guess is they've sought shelter.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.890
You mean your best hope.

16:56.050 --> 16:59.140
You know the likelihood
of surviving the steppe,

16:59.220 --> 17:02.180
on foot, north of Khantai Gorge.

17:02.270 --> 17:04.900
I do, very well,
as do my trackers.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.020
They are preparing to leave tonight.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.190
-They will find them.
-No.

17:10.190 --> 17:11.990
We will find them.

17:34.930 --> 17:38.510
Thank Tengri he has been
devoured so quickly.

17:40.430 --> 17:44.020
I wish there was a way to know
when his soul arrived in heaven.

17:45.480 --> 17:48.730
A bell.
A breeze.

17:48.810 --> 17:50.480
Some certain thing.

17:58.820 --> 18:01.450
He rests in the Blue Sky now.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.540
May I ask how you knew my husband?

18:08.330 --> 18:11.170
Forgive me.
I am Bolormaa.

18:16.380 --> 18:17.890
I am Nergüi.

18:20.050 --> 18:21.600
Do you work in the stables?

18:22.350 --> 18:23.930
No.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.770
But I pass them frequently.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.560
I didn't know your husband well...

18:29.520 --> 18:31.690
but you could tell he was kind.

18:31.770 --> 18:33.690
By his eyes.

18:34.740 --> 18:36.860
Even on the darkest of days.

18:40.740 --> 18:42.370
You look familiar.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.330
Maybe our paths have crossed.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.670
They certainly have now.

18:56.550 --> 18:59.010
And it would be wise
to keep them that way.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.680
-Another day soon, perhaps?
-I would like that.

19:06.270 --> 19:09.850
Thank you, Nergüi,
for paying this respect to him.

19:27.450 --> 19:28.750
They're not here.

19:28.830 --> 19:31.460
You'd take the word
of a round eye over blood?

19:32.580 --> 19:33.880
Sad, isn't it?

19:34.670 --> 19:36.840
But his words have proven true.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.970
- Whereas yours...
- Great Khan.

19:40.970 --> 19:45.260
How you've grown greater
and greater with each passing year.

19:45.350 --> 19:48.480
And you, Cousin Shabkana...

19:48.560 --> 19:50.480
more and more delicate.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.520
Your skin brings to mind fine parchment,

19:53.610 --> 19:57.440
or the rose petals I use to clean my ass.

19:57.530 --> 20:02.530
Your words no longer cut me, Kublai.
That is the great gift of age.

20:02.610 --> 20:06.410
Nor yours me.
The great, great gift of sovereignty.

20:07.040 --> 20:11.160
You speak as you rule,
like a bull-yak.

20:11.250 --> 20:13.790
Your mother's blood has proven unyielding.

20:14.710 --> 20:18.670
To be mothered by a yak
or a nagging witch?

20:18.760 --> 20:20.670
Which do you prefer?

20:20.760 --> 20:22.090
Prepare the horses.

20:23.050 --> 20:24.720
We ride tonight.

20:34.020 --> 20:36.150
Tell us why you are here, Nayan.

20:36.940 --> 20:38.730
- What ails him?
- Leprosy.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.490
Ah.

20:40.570 --> 20:42.950
As ambassador from the Mongol lands.

20:43.030 --> 20:44.410
Mmm-hmm.

20:44.490 --> 20:47.950
With respect and greetings
from the Great Khan himself.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.330
You've told him nothing of our agenda?

20:50.410 --> 20:51.620
Amongst other matters,

20:51.700 --> 20:55.630
your desire to secure a new crusade
for recovery of the Holy Land.

20:55.710 --> 20:57.840
-What ails him?
-Satan's voices.

20:57.920 --> 20:58.920
Ah.

21:01.420 --> 21:04.430
And do you believe it is our duty
to reclaim the Holy Lands?

21:04.510 --> 21:05.840
I do.

21:05.930 --> 21:09.350
And do you believe it is
our Christian duty to spread the gospel?

21:09.430 --> 21:10.930
There is no greater duty.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.940
To all peoples?

21:13.020 --> 21:17.650
-Even the Saracens and the non-Christians?
-Most importantly, the non-Christians.

21:18.770 --> 21:23.360
Then you believe, as we do,
that Kublai Khan must be eradicated.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.490
-The Khan?
-Yes, your nephew.

21:27.570 --> 21:30.660
And trusted friend of the Church,
of all religions.

21:30.740 --> 21:35.540
It's precisely this inclusiveness
we believe to be our greatest threat.

21:35.620 --> 21:39.130
Kublai has pledged time and again
to leave the Christians in peace.

21:39.210 --> 21:42.630
So long as all are faithful to him
and obey his laws.

21:42.710 --> 21:45.760
They are free to practice
whichever religion they choose.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.050
And do you think
the peoples of South China

21:48.140 --> 21:50.010
feel their souls are free?

21:50.100 --> 21:52.100
The Khan is your kin.

21:52.180 --> 21:56.020
We understand your loyalty to him,
but I abandoned my own blood.

21:57.860 --> 22:01.020
This is the Christian sacrifice.

22:01.110 --> 22:04.740
Kublai harbors no ill will
towards our faith. His own mother...

22:04.820 --> 22:08.910
Yes, his mother was a Christian,
but he isn't.

22:10.280 --> 22:12.450
His religion is power.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.120
And now that he's conquered China,

22:14.200 --> 22:16.370
there's nothing to stop him
from moving west.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.540
Except us, of course.

22:21.210 --> 22:23.010
Unless I'm mistaken.

22:31.800 --> 22:35.480
My father stank of wet goat.

22:36.180 --> 22:39.770
Every time I walk through the slums,
I think of him.

22:40.690 --> 22:41.860
But that's all I remember.

22:41.940 --> 22:45.940
...Not his face, not his touch.

22:46.030 --> 22:49.410
Just that... stink.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.410
What happened to him?

22:55.200 --> 22:56.750
My father?

22:58.040 --> 22:59.790
He's the most powerful man on earth.

23:09.050 --> 23:10.840
Tell me about your mother.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.510
What do you remember of her?

23:14.510 --> 23:16.020
Everything.

23:16.930 --> 23:18.980
The lines on her face as she smiled.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.360
Her oils.

23:23.440 --> 23:24.820
Lavender.

23:25.690 --> 23:30.280
The cool of her hand
as she stroked my cheek when I slept.

23:30.360 --> 23:33.530
And... the lull of her voice.

23:42.040 --> 23:43.290
She hid me.

23:44.380 --> 23:46.460
- When the Khan came.

23:46.550 --> 23:47.630
She hid me.

23:52.340 --> 23:53.550
Men burned and...

23:55.890 --> 23:57.810
women ravaged.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.890
And the children...

24:03.110 --> 24:04.360
I watched her die.

24:08.650 --> 24:09.780
I watched her die.

24:12.820 --> 24:15.700
Then...

24:17.910 --> 24:19.660
she took me in her arms.

24:22.460 --> 24:26.840
And that... is a feeling I do recall.

24:28.630 --> 24:30.090
One of pure love.

24:34.470 --> 24:35.800
Chabi.

24:57.450 --> 24:59.200
What is that?

25:03.540 --> 25:05.130
My mother wrote it for me.

25:07.130 --> 25:10.510
She would sing it every night
as I lay down to sleep.

25:22.850 --> 25:24.390
It's beautiful.

25:39.120 --> 25:42.160
There's blood,
but the trail disappears.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.080
The tracks are covered.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.540
We crossed a dry riverbed
just west of here. They might follow it.

25:46.620 --> 25:48.630
If ever I'm cursed
with visiting your homeland,

25:48.710 --> 25:50.090
you may guide the way.

25:50.170 --> 25:52.960
Until then... stay quiet.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.680
Cast the raptor out.
Have it favor the north.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.180
How long will that take?
A day?

26:01.260 --> 26:02.720
If they've traveled north.

26:03.230 --> 26:04.640
Compass.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.150
This path cuts east.

26:15.240 --> 26:19.120
We'll follow it while the raptor covers
all other terrains.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.080
It was the lesser of two evils.

26:29.170 --> 26:32.000
Did you ever even consider saying no?

26:34.960 --> 26:36.090
No.

26:38.340 --> 26:41.850
You said there would come a time
where we could return to normal.

26:41.930 --> 26:42.930
We can.

26:43.010 --> 26:47.350
If your father wins, you will be heir
to the throne of the Mongol Empire.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.150
How will that be normal?

26:51.610 --> 26:53.020
My father told you that?

26:53.110 --> 26:54.650
Yes.

26:54.730 --> 26:56.240
I know.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.280
Another thing you couldn't tell me.

27:31.770 --> 27:34.480
- They say grief is hardest on focus.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.480
But I'd say fear is worse.

27:36.570 --> 27:38.780
Uncertainty of an outcome.

27:38.860 --> 27:41.700
You have borne no children.

27:41.780 --> 27:42.780
You know nothing.

27:43.740 --> 27:45.200
I know of suffering.

27:45.290 --> 27:48.500
What could a child such as yourself
know of suffering?

27:48.580 --> 27:51.960
We measure age not in years
but in lifetimes.

27:57.050 --> 28:00.800
And...
in all your lifetimes...

28:00.880 --> 28:05.010
how long has it taken
for your karma to catch up with you?

28:05.930 --> 28:08.980
The nature of karma
is that it comes when it comes,

28:09.060 --> 28:11.100
at just the right moment,

28:11.190 --> 28:14.730
exactly when one is ready
to heed its message.

28:14.810 --> 28:18.490
And if one heeds the message...

28:18.570 --> 28:20.360
makes recompense...

28:21.780 --> 28:24.030
can the karma be changed?

28:24.660 --> 28:27.870
For every action,
there is a ripple sent through time.

28:27.950 --> 28:30.080
One cannot escape one's karma.

28:30.710 --> 28:34.080
If you do not wish to become a eunuch...

28:34.170 --> 28:35.500
stop speaking in riddles.

28:36.540 --> 28:39.590
Then again, I suppose one can change it.

28:39.670 --> 28:41.050
How?

28:42.260 --> 28:44.590
Learn compassion.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.600
Carefully imagine how others feel.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.930
Put yourself in their circumstances

28:49.020 --> 28:51.480
and practice kindness
from that day forward.

28:52.390 --> 28:53.730
That is it?

28:53.810 --> 28:56.560
It will change your karma now.

29:04.700 --> 29:07.120
Or many lifetimes from now.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.460
-Hello, Empress Chabi.
-Oh!

29:58.460 --> 30:00.300
Hello, my Princess Ling Ling.

30:00.380 --> 30:03.590
- Am I still a princess?
- Of course you are.

30:03.670 --> 30:06.880
Master Ahmad says
I may marry a prince one day.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.550
Does he now?

30:09.640 --> 30:11.310
If I'm very lucky.

30:11.810 --> 30:15.850
And what would
make you feel very lucky now?

30:15.940 --> 30:19.270
Are there things you wish for or need?

30:19.360 --> 30:21.520
Delights or savories...

30:21.610 --> 30:24.070
When can I see my mother again?

30:28.030 --> 30:30.490
I don't know, but...

30:30.580 --> 30:34.330
I am your guardian now,
your safe-keeper.

30:35.330 --> 30:38.250
I would let no harm befall you.

30:40.540 --> 30:42.800
May I go now, Empress Chabi?

30:44.050 --> 30:45.340
Yes.

31:53.580 --> 31:54.990
Sit.

32:04.710 --> 32:07.090
That ridgeline.

32:07.170 --> 32:08.670
You remember.

32:09.970 --> 32:12.890
Grandfather's favorite spot
for lesson-teaching.

32:14.100 --> 32:17.890
I always thought
he was taking us there to kill us.

32:19.390 --> 32:22.770
-How we fought as young wolves.
-Oh, beating each other's ribs in.

32:23.860 --> 32:26.900
We stopped fighting, you and I,
after the arrow teaching.

32:28.900 --> 32:32.320
"If brothers can be picked off
and isolated..."

32:34.740 --> 32:37.030
"...they can be snapped in half."

32:37.790 --> 32:41.790
"But if they can learn to stand together,
like a bundle of arrows,

32:41.870 --> 32:44.500
-they're unbreakable..."
-Hmm.

32:44.580 --> 32:45.960
"...undefeatable."

32:48.760 --> 32:51.260
Genghis can unify wolf and fox
with his parables.

32:58.390 --> 33:01.560
That may take more than a parable.

33:07.610 --> 33:10.860
He hasn't
breathed a word of this. Not to me.

33:10.940 --> 33:12.650
I'm supposed to
believe that now?

33:12.740 --> 33:14.700
It's the truth.

33:15.410 --> 33:18.740
You, the first woman Khan.
That's what he said.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.250
What would that make me?
Keeper of the hearth?

33:21.330 --> 33:23.000
Maybe.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.630
-That's not what I'm meant to be.
-And I am?

33:26.710 --> 33:29.380
-So you want it?
-What if I did?

33:29.460 --> 33:32.670
What if I were heir to the Mongol throne?
What if I ascended one day?

33:32.760 --> 33:35.260
...Are you man enough to support me?

33:35.340 --> 33:36.840
Would you do it for me?

33:38.050 --> 33:40.060
I don't have to answer that.

33:40.140 --> 33:42.310
Because you will never be Khan.

33:42.390 --> 33:44.640
And I will never marry one either.

33:50.900 --> 33:53.030
I was in Tunis with the King.

33:53.110 --> 33:56.320
I was just a deacon on a...
a crusade.

33:56.410 --> 33:58.530
And one morning, I woke up...

33:59.450 --> 34:00.490
I couldn't piss.

34:01.580 --> 34:03.500
Not a trickle. Nothing.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.370
Mmm, so sometime later...

34:07.460 --> 34:10.000
very close to here, actually,
a few streets away...

34:11.460 --> 34:14.880
I was delivered of the news
that I had been elected pontiff.

34:15.380 --> 34:18.929
Quite a surprise for everyone.
No one more than me.

34:19.010 --> 34:21.100
Now, here I am now,
God's voice on earth,

34:21.179 --> 34:23.469
and still, still, barely a drip.

34:27.100 --> 34:29.860
All my life...
I've been challenged by men

34:29.940 --> 34:33.739
who believe they've been chosen
by a God of one sort or another.

34:33.820 --> 34:37.280
Mmm, and one day,
we shall see who is right.

34:38.489 --> 34:39.489
Yes, Your Holiness.

34:39.570 --> 34:41.370
But in the meantime...

34:41.449 --> 34:45.080
I found forfeiting my beliefs
to be in no one's best interest.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.090
But that's a virtue, Nayan.

34:52.170 --> 34:55.210
One God seeks out
in his noblest of servants.

34:55.300 --> 34:57.550
Depending on
what you believe in, of course.

34:59.180 --> 35:02.640
My Khan and my Creator.

35:06.520 --> 35:07.940
You see...

35:08.020 --> 35:10.650
people come in here
and they look at the...

35:10.730 --> 35:14.320
the silks, the golds,
the marble, the manuscripts.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.900
And many want to burn it.

35:15.990 --> 35:18.660
They want us to choke
on the ash of our traditions.

35:18.740 --> 35:23.740
And I see you, Nayan, standing there,
wobbling between two worlds,

35:23.830 --> 35:26.330
wagering your eternal salvation.

35:30.420 --> 35:32.920
I want you to understand something.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.380
If the Mongols come...

35:35.460 --> 35:37.130
we will not cower.

35:37.210 --> 35:39.300
We will not capitulate.

35:39.380 --> 35:44.260
We will not negotiate for anything
but your Khan's unconditional surrender.

35:46.060 --> 35:49.690
And when the ash clears...

35:49.770 --> 35:53.060
I'll be looking to see
which side you stand on.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.900
As will your Creator.

36:05.990 --> 36:07.120
The horses.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.540
...Do you see them?

36:16.090 --> 36:17.590
So many.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.430
Do you see?

36:22.550 --> 36:24.430
They are painted true to life.

36:26.510 --> 36:27.850
Ahmad?

36:28.770 --> 36:30.600
They bring peace.

36:33.350 --> 36:34.860
Ahmad, look at me.

36:48.580 --> 36:50.580
You should see.

36:52.710 --> 36:55.040
I hold his head...

36:55.130 --> 36:57.040
in my bloodied hands.

37:04.260 --> 37:08.060
When he didn't make it home for dinner,
I got worried,

37:08.140 --> 37:11.180
asked my brother to have a look in town.

37:11.270 --> 37:13.060
I can be a jealous wife,

37:13.140 --> 37:15.770
even though he has never
given me cause to be.

37:17.770 --> 37:20.400
They found him by the river...

37:20.480 --> 37:22.440
just a ways up from the pond.

37:23.530 --> 37:27.910
He must have slipped,
hit his head on a rock.

37:27.990 --> 37:30.910
The river's current
were too strong that day.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.460
I'm so sorry.

37:35.960 --> 37:38.040
I take comfort in knowing

37:38.130 --> 37:42.130
his last moments
were spent at his favorite place.

37:42.210 --> 37:43.800
There he is.

37:46.090 --> 37:50.470
Mother, this is Nergüi,
the friend of Batbayer I spoke of.

37:53.270 --> 37:55.390
And this is Alagh.

37:57.150 --> 38:00.400
He's so beautiful.

38:02.610 --> 38:04.610
He looks like his father.

38:10.530 --> 38:11.990
So tell me, Nayan,

38:12.080 --> 38:17.500
how in the vast wastelands
of heathenism did you find Jesus Christ?

38:17.580 --> 38:19.790
To tell that story,
I'd have to share my sins.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.000
Oh,
let this be your confession.

38:24.340 --> 38:27.890
- Temptation was my burden.
- Hmm, what kind of temptation?

38:27.970 --> 38:30.140
- Of the flesh.
- Uh-huh.

38:31.350 --> 38:34.640
Well, that's not a sin
unless you follow through on it.

38:34.730 --> 38:36.600
I did, many times.

38:38.940 --> 38:42.650
I cannot grant you absolution
until you speak your transgressions.

38:42.730 --> 38:44.610
I do not seek pardon.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.860
Were it not for those sins,
I never would have met him.

38:52.830 --> 38:55.040
I could no longer control my yearnings.

38:56.870 --> 38:58.750
So I cast myself in the desert...

39:00.380 --> 39:03.130
knowing that I had
no time left on this earth.

39:04.630 --> 39:06.010
He appeared...

39:07.220 --> 39:09.140
blanketed me in the shade.

39:09.220 --> 39:10.340
He made me rise,

39:10.430 --> 39:13.310
and though we walked for weeks,
I never thirsted,

39:13.390 --> 39:15.390
nor did I feel hunger.

39:15.470 --> 39:18.020
He filled me with salvation.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.360
"All is not lost."

39:26.780 --> 39:29.740
You've met the fabled Prester John?

39:29.820 --> 39:32.280
Yes, we've all heard the stories.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.490
Descended from the Magi,
casts shadows in the night,

39:35.580 --> 39:37.330
resides by the river of heaven,

39:37.410 --> 39:39.620
which imparts everlasting life.

39:39.710 --> 39:42.290
He's cunning, he's merciless.

39:43.250 --> 39:44.800
The hand of God.

39:46.170 --> 39:48.630
His vast army sweeps
undetected across the land,

39:48.720 --> 39:51.430
leveling faithless villages and cities.

39:52.340 --> 39:55.850
-He exterminates...
-Prester John is nothing but merciful,

39:55.930 --> 39:57.640
Your Holiness.

39:57.720 --> 40:02.270
He offers mankind the opportunity
to open their hearts to Christ.

40:02.350 --> 40:04.480
And what if their hearts remain shuttered?

40:04.570 --> 40:06.190
Well...

40:06.280 --> 40:09.030
then that's the finest example
of his mercy.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.110
He returns them...

40:12.200 --> 40:15.280
to the warm embrace of their Maker.

40:16.910 --> 40:18.120
You knew of this?

40:18.790 --> 40:21.210
I wanted you to hear it yourself.

40:23.790 --> 40:28.420
Our Crusaders have long prayed
to meet him and his army.

40:28.510 --> 40:30.880
I've sent emissaries in search of him.

40:31.840 --> 40:33.510
But none has ever returned.

40:33.590 --> 40:37.760
He reveals himself to the needy,
but only when he sees fit to do so.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.890
You were chosen to do God's work.

40:42.640 --> 40:46.190
And only He knows
how I am to do His good work.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.740
Well...

40:51.740 --> 40:56.080
we might be able to figure it out...
together.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.090
Over here.

41:13.260 --> 41:14.300
They were here.

41:17.100 --> 41:21.520
My Khan, it's best that fewer men proceed,
to preserve the track.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.980
Go.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.400
Five arrows.

41:31.440 --> 41:33.360
Unified Mongol brothers.

41:33.450 --> 41:35.070
Unbreakable.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.370
And sisters.

41:37.320 --> 41:41.250
-And sisters.
-A lesson on how to conquer the world.

41:42.950 --> 41:45.250
A lesson in the power of Mongol unity.

41:45.750 --> 41:47.130
Is there any difference?

41:47.210 --> 41:49.420
A fundamental difference.

41:50.090 --> 41:52.460
Between stability and chaos.

41:52.550 --> 41:55.220
Expansion is chaos?

41:55.300 --> 42:00.140
It was Genghis and your very own Ögödei
who dreamt of the taking of China.

42:00.640 --> 42:03.020
I only succeeded where they failed.

42:03.100 --> 42:05.600
They did not foresee the peril
to our nomadic way of life.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.600
What peril?

42:07.690 --> 42:11.190
Are you not still a nomad
living in a fucking ger?

42:24.620 --> 42:25.620
Empress.

42:28.540 --> 42:30.590
I had occasion today
to see your daughter.

42:32.800 --> 42:36.430
It pleases me to tell you
that she is quite well.

42:36.510 --> 42:38.550
Happy and safe.

42:40.300 --> 42:43.890
So very gracious of you
to bring the news yourself.

42:44.680 --> 42:46.690
As a mother...

42:46.770 --> 42:50.270
I understand you.
I thought you'd be eager to hear.

42:52.190 --> 42:54.320
It is a great relief.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.610
Good.

42:56.950 --> 42:58.360
I...

43:14.880 --> 43:17.220
Is there something else, my Empress?

43:18.680 --> 43:20.090
No.

43:54.840 --> 43:58.260
Genghis did not intend for us
to sit in palaces,

43:58.340 --> 44:00.300
polishing the treasures of other cultures.

44:00.380 --> 44:05.310
What is it about progress
that makes you squeal like a pig in heat?

44:05.390 --> 44:07.640
Sight of my origins.

44:07.720 --> 44:10.060
Purity of my ancestors' intent.

44:10.140 --> 44:12.440
Lose that and I lose my soul.

44:12.520 --> 44:15.730
Purity is cried
by those who follow.

44:15.820 --> 44:17.940
Leading is putting your soul on the line,

44:18.030 --> 44:21.110
so others may have
the freedom to ponder theirs.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.530
It's an onus like no other.

44:22.610 --> 44:25.990
If you so resent it,
why not relinquish it?

44:26.490 --> 44:29.040
So that you could tear down
everything I built?

44:29.120 --> 44:32.170
You really want to be remembered
for ruining an empire

44:32.250 --> 44:34.080
on the cusp of ruling over all?

44:34.170 --> 44:36.340
I want to be the one
remembered for saving it.

44:36.420 --> 44:37.880
...From you.

44:38.550 --> 44:42.720
Rhetoric is easy.
But it masks envy, lust, greed.

44:43.510 --> 44:46.510
Or is just a desire to finally still
your old mother's nagging?

44:50.600 --> 44:53.400
Spoken by the son
of a murderous, thieving bitch.

44:56.570 --> 44:58.860
You curse my mother,
you curse a Mongol queen.

44:58.940 --> 45:01.650
Who pushed aside my father's line.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.780
Who schemed to win power for her sons.

45:04.870 --> 45:06.870
Still your tongue, or I'll take it.

45:06.950 --> 45:09.830
The nation's tongue
has been stilled long enough.

45:13.080 --> 45:16.290
You stole the Kurultai
that named you Khan.

45:16.380 --> 45:18.500
Legacy to a family of thieves.

45:38.020 --> 45:40.150
After I win...

45:40.230 --> 45:44.950
I'm gonna level your lands
and massacre anyone you ever cared for.

45:45.450 --> 45:50.700
Only you could imagine
you're in any position to cast a threat.

45:51.450 --> 45:54.500
The moment he cuts my throat,
cut him down.

46:05.220 --> 46:06.590
Have at it.

46:08.470 --> 46:09.510
We found them.

46:12.930 --> 46:14.560
Father?

46:36.710 --> 46:38.750
You'll live, my son.

47:22.500 --> 47:24.960
I'll see you at the Kurultai.

48:31.200 --> 48:32.740
Do you have a family?

48:34.870 --> 48:36.200
My parents.

48:37.490 --> 48:40.660
I live with them
on the other side of the slums.

48:40.750 --> 48:42.040
No husband?

48:42.960 --> 48:44.330
Just us.

48:45.960 --> 48:47.670
Someday maybe I will.

48:47.750 --> 48:49.920
You are too beautiful
not to have a husband.

48:50.010 --> 48:52.380
You're too kind.

48:54.510 --> 48:57.640
You should come to our house,
all of you.

48:58.560 --> 49:00.100
I'll make you dinner.

49:01.180 --> 49:02.690
That would be lovely.

49:04.020 --> 49:07.190
It would... wouldn't it?

49:08.400 --> 49:11.150
Prince Jingim's been found.

49:11.240 --> 49:14.490
- And he is well?
- Quite, they say.

49:14.570 --> 49:17.700
He travels back now with the Great Khan.

49:33.050 --> 49:34.260
See?

49:34.340 --> 49:37.510
Even the most difficult things
come to an end.

49:43.890 --> 49:45.230
You were right.

49:46.350 --> 49:48.480
And I cannot wait to tell my husband.

49:49.980 --> 49:51.320
He's going to be a father.

50:08.710 --> 50:10.130
I'm pregnant.

50:51.960 --> 50:53.710
Let God's work begin.
