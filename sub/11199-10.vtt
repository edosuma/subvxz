WEBVTT

00:01.615 --> 00:04.015
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:04.084 --> 00:07.349
These two liquids mixed together
form a most virulent poison.

00:07.421 --> 00:10.447
- Am I to hold my breath?
- The poison is only deadly to symbiotes.

00:10.524 --> 00:14.460
There's enough material in that vial to
kill every Tok'ra on this base twice over.

00:14.528 --> 00:17.019
<i>Anubis once probed Thor's mind,</i>
<i>and in doing so...</i>

00:17.097 --> 00:19.292
they would've gained access
to Asgard beaming technology.

00:19.366 --> 00:22.233
Did you really think they were
gonna let you tell a secret like this?

00:22.302 --> 00:25.169
- Brian! What are you talking about?
- They call themselves The Trust.

00:25.238 --> 00:28.696
<i>They've been funding various secret</i>
<i>endeavors, all aimed at controlling...</i>

00:28.775 --> 00:30.970
alien technology
for their own purposes.

00:31.044 --> 00:32.807
<i>The symbols, Dr. Jackson.</i>

00:32.879 --> 00:37.009
<i>We know it's the language of the Ancients.</i>
<i>We need them translated into Goa'uld.</i>

00:37.084 --> 00:39.177
So either you give us
what we want...

00:43.423 --> 00:44.515
or I will kill her.

01:01.908 --> 01:03.876
What's goin' on?

01:03.944 --> 01:05.809
Not much.

01:10.417 --> 01:13.784
I hate the graveyard shift.
Nothing exciting ever happens on it.

01:15.522 --> 01:18.389
Hey, just 'cause
it's 3:00 a.m. Here...

01:18.458 --> 01:21.120
doesn't mean it's not
daylight on other planets.

01:26.199 --> 01:30.295
There could be a team
coming in hot any second now.

01:30.370 --> 01:32.770
Yeah. That's true.

01:39.312 --> 01:41.712
- So, coffee?
- Yeah.

01:45.919 --> 01:47.648
Let me ask you something.

01:47.721 --> 01:49.985
It's late at night,
and there's not many people around.

01:50.056 --> 01:53.287
You ever get the urge just to dial up
the gate and check out another planet?

01:53.360 --> 01:54.554
Just for a few minutes?

01:55.595 --> 01:58.393
- That'd be a "no."
- Me neither.

02:00.734 --> 02:02.702
What the hell?

02:23.557 --> 02:25.024
The gate's gone.

02:27.093 --> 02:29.027
I can see that.

02:30.597 --> 02:32.792
Are we gonna get
in trouble for this?

03:48.108 --> 03:51.407
And what about your instruments? Were
you detecting any signs of gate activity?

03:51.478 --> 03:54.777
- No, sir.
- Did anyone approach the gate at any time?

03:55.849 --> 03:58.511
No unusual activity of any kind?

04:01.555 --> 04:03.250
Okay.

04:04.224 --> 04:07.352
Sir, are we going to be facing
any kind of disciplinary action for this?

04:07.427 --> 04:11.625
No, Sergeant. I think it's safe to say
there was nothing you could have done.

04:11.698 --> 04:13.632
Thank God!

04:13.700 --> 04:16.294
I mean, there wasn't. One minute,
we were getting coffee...

04:16.369 --> 04:18.599
- the next minute, the gate-
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

04:18.672 --> 04:20.697
You were getting coffee?

04:25.612 --> 04:28.206
I'm joking. I'm joking.
It's just a joke. I'm sorry.

04:28.281 --> 04:30.681
Okay, that's all.
Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.

04:30.750 --> 04:32.240
Okay.

04:42.362 --> 04:45.661
Boy, I'd hate to be the guy that has
to explain this to the president.

04:49.035 --> 04:52.266
Sir, I've got the video
surveillance footage.

04:58.812 --> 05:02.248
The gate disappeared at 0307.

05:02.315 --> 05:04.249
There were two airmen
in the gate room...

05:04.317 --> 05:06.410
and two technicians in
the control room...

05:06.486 --> 05:10.149
but none of them saw or heard anything
out of the ordinary prior to the flash.

05:17.030 --> 05:19.328
Is it just me, or does that look like
an Asgard beam?

05:19.399 --> 05:22.766
It does, which makes no sense.
Why would they take our gate?

05:22.836 --> 05:25.896
Yeah. Usually they ask nicely...

05:25.972 --> 05:28.873
before they ignore us and do whatever
they damn well please.

05:28.942 --> 05:31.103
What about <i>Prometheus?</i>
Didn't the Asgard...

05:31.177 --> 05:33.145
install beam technology
as well as a hyperdrive?

05:33.213 --> 05:36.580
Yeah. It's in the hangar. We're still
making adjustments to the new engines.

05:36.650 --> 05:38.515
There is
another possibility.

05:38.585 --> 05:41.782
We know that Anubis possessed
Asgard beam technology.

05:41.855 --> 05:44.346
We also know that Ba'al
took over much of his fleet.

05:44.424 --> 05:46.517
You think Ba'al
stole our gate?

05:46.593 --> 05:49.061
To be honest, right now,
I don't know what to think.

05:49.129 --> 05:51.256
Well, I need some answers.

05:51.331 --> 05:53.196
That's not gonna
be easy, sir.

05:53.266 --> 05:56.326
Without a gate, we have
no access to off-world intel.

05:56.403 --> 05:58.837
We have no way of knowing
what's going on out there.

05:59.639 --> 06:01.004
You'll think of something.

06:02.742 --> 06:04.676
In the meantime...

06:04.744 --> 06:06.735
I have a phone call to make.

06:11.785 --> 06:14.413
Is Teal'c still on P4S-161?

06:14.487 --> 06:17.718
Yeah, his meeting with the rebel
Jaffa leaders should be over by now.

06:17.791 --> 06:21.158
When he can't contact us, he'll follow
protocol and head to the Alpha Site.

06:42.282 --> 06:44.409
- Colonel Pierce.
- Teal'c.

06:44.484 --> 06:46.111
What is the situation?

06:46.186 --> 06:48.746
We've been out of contact
with Earth for seven hours now.

06:48.822 --> 06:52.588
We can establish a wormhole, but we get
a "Do Not Proceed" response to our I DC.

06:52.659 --> 06:55.628
As was the case when I attempted to
return from my mission.

06:56.596 --> 06:58.996
They've had lockdowns before,
but the fact that...

06:59.065 --> 07:01.863
they're not responding to any
of our radio calls has me concerned.

07:02.535 --> 07:05.368
Right now, we have no idea what's
happening at Stargate Command.

07:07.207 --> 07:09.971
I will return to P4S-161.

07:10.043 --> 07:14.207
The rebelJaffa will provide a cargo ship,
which I will then take to Earth.

07:17.450 --> 07:21.284
We're not jumping to conclusions.
This may be just a malfunction.

07:21.354 --> 07:24.414
But it's also possible
Earth has been compromised.

07:25.358 --> 07:26.848
Indeed.

07:34.334 --> 07:37.997
- Find anything?
- Yeah, as a matter of fact, I have.

07:38.071 --> 07:41.165
I've been going over gate room
security tapes and the sensor logs.

07:41.241 --> 07:43.300
For two days before
the gate disappeared...

07:43.376 --> 07:45.776
we were getting
this anomalous reading.

07:45.845 --> 07:49.303
We assumed it was residual feedback from
a recent overhaul of the superconductors.

07:49.382 --> 07:51.850
But... I don't think so.

07:51.918 --> 07:53.408
Look at this.

08:02.495 --> 08:04.861
- What was that?
- I don't know.

08:04.931 --> 08:07.923
But I checked the time code, and this
corresponds with the exact moment...

08:08.001 --> 08:10.435
that the sensors began
recording the anomaly.

08:21.848 --> 08:24.078
I think we need
to talk to this guy.

08:25.552 --> 08:27.520
Dr. Kevin Hartkans.

08:28.354 --> 08:30.185
He's been with the program
seven months.

08:30.256 --> 08:32.190
Clean record,
nothing out of the ordinary...

08:32.258 --> 08:33.782
except that he's gone missing.

08:33.860 --> 08:37.694
He failed to report for duty this morning.
We checked his apartment. Cleaned out.

08:37.764 --> 08:40.198
This is starting
to sound familiar.

08:40.266 --> 08:43.724
- You think it's The Trust?
- Well, they've been busy lately.

08:43.803 --> 08:46.101
They had Teal'c under surveillance,
they blackmailed you...

08:46.172 --> 08:48.072
and they tried
to kill Alec Colson.

08:48.141 --> 08:50.735
Obviously, the operation is a lot
bigger than we first thought.

08:50.810 --> 08:54.337
Now, as far as we know,
the NI D has been clean for over a year...

08:54.414 --> 08:57.611
but there are still dozens of
ex-agents who are unaccounted for...

08:57.684 --> 09:00.346
and they continue to receive
financing from unknown sources.

09:00.420 --> 09:04.982
Please. If they can take the gate out from
under us, they could empty Fort Knox.

09:05.058 --> 09:06.650
Not necessarily.

09:06.726 --> 09:09.388
If they could take the gate anytime
they wanted, they would have.

09:09.462 --> 09:12.898
But that doesn't explain what Hartkans
was doing or the anomalous signal.

09:13.733 --> 09:15.030
Got a theory?

09:15.101 --> 09:19.231
The <i>Prometheus</i> has Asgard beam
technology, but not Asgard sensors...

09:19.305 --> 09:21.773
which means that we can't
pinpoint specific targets...

09:21.841 --> 09:24.105
unless they've been
tagged in advance.

09:24.177 --> 09:26.168
What if whoever did this
has the same problem?

09:26.246 --> 09:28.510
You think the anomaly
was a locator beacon.

09:28.581 --> 09:32.039
Yeah, which Hartkans placed
directly on the gate.

09:32.118 --> 09:34.552
I mean, there's no other way
they could pull this off.

09:34.621 --> 09:36.748
So my stamp collection is safe.

09:36.823 --> 09:38.757
How does that help us
find the gate?

09:38.825 --> 09:42.522
If they want to keep using the beam,
they'll have to keep using the beacons.

09:42.595 --> 09:46.053
We could request NSA satellite time
to see if we could detect the signal.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.656
Do it.

10:12.926 --> 10:14.257
M'zel.

10:17.830 --> 10:19.821
What has happened here?

10:20.667 --> 10:23.602
When I arrived,
they were all dead.

10:24.837 --> 10:25.895
All?

10:27.874 --> 10:29.603
I will show you.

10:56.336 --> 10:58.566
We took out a couple guards,
and we have the area secured.

10:58.638 --> 11:01.573
Satellite intel puts the signal
somewhere inside this complex.

11:01.641 --> 11:04.109
All right, you three are with us.
Keep your men on the perimeter.

11:04.177 --> 11:06.509
- No one in, no one out.
- Understood.

11:06.579 --> 11:08.570
Teams two and three,
retain on perimeter.

11:35.875 --> 11:37.365
Sam!

11:42.515 --> 11:45.712
- Daniel, these are VX rockets.
- Yeah? What's this?

11:46.519 --> 11:48.646
- Methylphosphonothioic acid.
- Which is?

11:48.721 --> 11:51.315
- Nerve gas.
- Okay, putting that back.

11:52.725 --> 11:55.125
There's enough here to kill
several hundred thousand people.

11:55.194 --> 11:57.355
What would the ex-NI D
be doing stockpiling this stuff?

11:57.430 --> 11:58.488
I've no idea.

11:59.766 --> 12:01.233
Drop it!

12:16.883 --> 12:18.942
We got a problem here.
What do we do?

12:19.786 --> 12:21.720
It's too late.

12:27.026 --> 12:30.757
- Nothing's happening.
- This doesn't make sense.

12:30.830 --> 12:33.993
The effects are almost instantaneous.
We should all be dead.

12:49.982 --> 12:51.472
You see?

13:19.045 --> 13:22.071
We managed to identify the liquid
we found in the warehouse.

13:23.015 --> 13:24.949
It's symbiote poison.

13:25.751 --> 13:29.915
Specifically, the new formula we were
working on in conjunction with the Tok'ra.

13:29.989 --> 13:32.583
It's more stable than the original
and easier to produce...

13:32.658 --> 13:35.650
- but just as deadly to the Goa'uld.
- And theJaffa.

13:35.728 --> 13:40.256
Exactly, which is why we agreed not to
use it except in defensive situations.

13:40.333 --> 13:43.962
Sir, the people
behind this have the gate...

13:44.036 --> 13:46.334
and they have rockets capable
of delivering the poison...

13:46.405 --> 13:48.498
in aerosol form over large areas.

13:48.574 --> 13:51.941
I think The Trust intends to
launch a full-scale chemical attack...

13:52.011 --> 13:54.241
against the Goa'uld,
without any regard...

13:54.313 --> 13:57.282
for the millions ofJaffa lives
that could be lost in the process.

13:58.084 --> 13:59.779
So they didn't get the memo.

14:01.554 --> 14:06.218
The guy from the warehouse isn't talking,
but he was carrying... this.

14:10.630 --> 14:13.190
It's an Area 51
identification badge.

14:22.308 --> 14:25.141
Colonel Carter, Dr. Jackson.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

14:25.211 --> 14:28.510
Dr. Bricksdale. I believe you've
been briefed on our situation.

14:28.581 --> 14:31.106
- Yes, I have.
- As a result of our investigation...

14:31.184 --> 14:34.051
we have reason to believe that
your security has been compromised.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.850
With all due respect, Colonel, we're not
the ones who lost the Stargate.

14:36.923 --> 14:40.415
But alien technology has gone
missing from Area 51 before.

14:41.194 --> 14:44.891
Yes, however, our security measures have
been significantly increased since then.

14:44.964 --> 14:46.898
No one's allowed to bring
anything in or out-

14:46.966 --> 14:50.925
no computers, no cell phones, not even
their street clothes, as you've seen.

14:51.003 --> 14:54.200
All personnel are subject to a thorough
search and scan every time they leave.

14:55.041 --> 14:59.842
Look, whoever took the Stargate
has access to Asgard beam technology.

14:59.912 --> 15:01.402
Last year, when Osiris
came to Earth...

15:01.480 --> 15:05.382
she used that same technology, which she
activated remotely with a wrist device.

15:05.451 --> 15:08.079
After she was captured,
that wrist device was brought here...

15:08.154 --> 15:11.590
- and you worked on it.
- And it's been here ever since.

15:12.858 --> 15:15.691
Well, if you don't mind,
we'd like to see it.

15:22.969 --> 15:26.666
Dr. Harris checked out some of
the dead Jaffa on P4S-161.

15:26.739 --> 15:29.173
You were right.
It was the Tok'ra symbiote poison.

15:29.242 --> 15:32.575
I would not have believed it
had I not seen it with my own eyes.

15:32.645 --> 15:36.376
I knew the Tok'ra lost patience with the
alliance, but never though they'd do this.

15:41.387 --> 15:44.015
I have received word
from ourJaffa brothers.

15:44.090 --> 15:46.991
Three more Goa'uld planets
have been attacked.

15:47.059 --> 15:48.788
Millions are dead.

16:10.249 --> 16:12.444
You see?
Right where we left it.

16:12.518 --> 16:14.577
Sorry if I'm a little skeptical, but...

16:14.654 --> 16:16.588
we've been down
this road before.

16:21.994 --> 16:24.394
- It's real.
- Like I said.

16:25.064 --> 16:27.760
We figured if Osiris's ship
was still up there...

16:27.833 --> 16:29.824
we could use the wrist device
to get on board.

16:29.902 --> 16:32.700
Unfortunately, it's not only keyed to
the presence of naquadah...

16:32.772 --> 16:36.264
in the blood of the user,
but also specific Goa'uld DNA.

16:36.342 --> 16:39.004
We tried to create an adapter
using samples of both elements...

16:39.078 --> 16:40.511
but we didn't get anywhere.

16:40.579 --> 16:44.447
So the ship is probably
still in orbit, but cloaked.

16:44.517 --> 16:46.883
In which case,
we have no way to find it.

16:49.722 --> 16:53.089
The Tok'ra will be made
to pay for this treachery!

16:53.159 --> 16:55.457
Let's just calm down a second.

16:55.528 --> 16:58.964
- We need to figure out what's going on.
- What more do you need to know?

16:59.031 --> 17:02.990
TheJaffa are being murdered,
poisoned like vermin.

17:03.069 --> 17:06.300
The Tok'ra have had this
chemical weapon for a long time.

17:06.372 --> 17:08.363
Why would they suddenly
decide to use it now?

17:08.441 --> 17:11.604
Perhaps the failure of the alliance
convinced them that there is no other way.

17:12.345 --> 17:14.643
There's something else going on.

17:14.714 --> 17:16.648
It's not a coincidence
that this happened...

17:16.716 --> 17:18.980
immediately after
we lost contact with Earth.

17:23.756 --> 17:25.587
That does seem unlikely.

17:26.325 --> 17:27.917
We must speak to
the Tok'ra directly.

17:28.994 --> 17:32.225
That's not so easy.
Ever since they left the Alpha Site...

17:32.298 --> 17:34.630
we haven't had much
intelligence on their movements.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.634
We have no idea where
their new base is.

17:36.702 --> 17:38.829
We still know the location
of some of their operatives.

17:38.904 --> 17:41.600
I believe our best chance
for contact is P3S-114.

17:41.674 --> 17:43.699
A Tok'ra operative named Zarin
is undercover...

17:43.776 --> 17:45.835
commanding one of
Ba'al's garrisons on that world.

17:45.911 --> 17:49.574
- I will come with you.
- Hold on a minute here.

17:49.648 --> 17:52.583
You're talking about walking
into Goa'uld-occupied territory...

17:52.651 --> 17:55.017
and there's noJaffa fifth
column there to help you out.

17:55.087 --> 17:57.885
Without sympathetic warriors
in Zarin's ranks...

17:57.957 --> 17:59.925
how do you plan
to avoid being captured?

17:59.992 --> 18:02.552
- We do not.
- What?

18:02.628 --> 18:06.064
Only by being captured will we
be brought before the commander.

18:06.132 --> 18:08.123
That's how you're
going to make contact?

18:08.200 --> 18:11.226
We must speak to the Tok'ra.
There is no other way.

18:11.303 --> 18:13.396
It's too risky.
You walk in there unannounced...

18:13.472 --> 18:16.100
and Zarin could have you sacrificed
just to maintain her cover.

18:16.175 --> 18:18.040
That is a great possibility.

18:21.747 --> 18:25.649
You realize the second you walk through
that gate, you're on your own.

18:27.953 --> 18:29.853
Understood.

19:00.853 --> 19:03.754
- So what's the big emergency?
- I can't do this anymore.

19:03.823 --> 19:06.348
You've already taken the money, Doctor.
A little late for cold feet.

19:06.425 --> 19:08.290
You don't understand.
They came to see me.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.453
- They asked me about the wrist device.
- Who?

19:10.529 --> 19:13.089
Two people
from Stargate Command.

19:13.165 --> 19:14.826
And you arranged
a meeting with me?

19:14.900 --> 19:16.197
What?

19:18.771 --> 19:20.830
You were followed.

19:49.802 --> 19:51.736
Hold your fire!
We need him alive!

20:45.791 --> 20:47.588
- Brooks.
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

20:47.660 --> 20:49.719
We've got
a small problem here.

20:49.795 --> 20:52.889
Take a locator beacon and get down
to Hoskins's last position.

20:52.965 --> 20:56.594
- <i>What happened?</i>
- We've got an uninvited guest.

21:12.851 --> 21:14.318
Speak.

21:14.386 --> 21:19.414
My lord Zarin, two enemyJaffa
have been captured near the gate.

21:19.491 --> 21:22.824
One of them
is the <i>shol'va</i> Teal'c.

21:24.797 --> 21:26.162
Are you certain?

21:29.201 --> 21:30.828
I am.

21:30.903 --> 21:33.838
Lord Ba'al will be most pleased,
will he not?

21:35.374 --> 21:38.741
Yes, of course.

21:38.811 --> 21:40.745
You have done well.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.240
Now bring them to me.

21:45.050 --> 21:47.314
Yes, my lord.

21:57.863 --> 21:59.797
I'm going to ask you again.

22:00.699 --> 22:02.189
Where's Colonel Carter?

22:03.168 --> 22:05.102
I don't know!

22:24.323 --> 22:26.018
You're going to need
to start cooperating.

22:26.892 --> 22:28.154
I can't.

22:28.227 --> 22:30.161
A decorated officer in
the United States Air Force...

22:30.229 --> 22:33.062
and a member of one of our government's
most top-secret organizations...

22:33.132 --> 22:35.225
is missing,
and you're implicated.

22:36.135 --> 22:38.626
I don't think you're going to
just walk away from this.

22:40.172 --> 22:42.470
- They'll kill me.
- We can protect you.

22:45.878 --> 22:50.008
And we can also choose to ignore
your <i>$2</i> million Cayman Island account.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.488
Didn't think we'd
find out about that, huh?

23:03.929 --> 23:06.193
So if I help you,
I can keep the money?

23:07.166 --> 23:09.157
We could come to
an arrangement.

23:31.056 --> 23:33.115
The prisoners, my lord.

23:33.892 --> 23:35.223
Leave us.

23:36.128 --> 23:37.117
My lord?

23:39.031 --> 23:43.195
I intend to question them myself.
Leave us now.

23:54.046 --> 23:57.038
Are you mad?
What are you doing here?

23:57.116 --> 23:59.641
- We must speak with you.
- Speak with me?

23:59.718 --> 24:03.745
Do you not realize that by coming here,
you have placed all our lives in danger?

24:03.822 --> 24:06.416
Are you not in control
of this garrison?

24:06.492 --> 24:08.960
I am, and as such...

24:09.027 --> 24:13.623
it is my responsibility to see to it
that you are tortured for information...

24:13.699 --> 24:17.999
until such time that Ba'al arrives
to witness your execution.

24:29.348 --> 24:31.441
So what's it going to be?

24:33.986 --> 24:35.977
You said Colonel Carter
was missing?

24:40.125 --> 24:42.150
Well, she's probably on the ship.

24:43.328 --> 24:44.989
Osiris's ship.

24:45.697 --> 24:47.995
So you did manage
to get on board.

24:51.069 --> 24:54.163
About a year ago,
some men came to see me.

24:54.239 --> 24:56.833
They knew everything about my work,
the Stargate, Osiris.

24:57.943 --> 25:01.845
They knew there was a possibility that
a cloaked ship had been left in orbit...

25:01.914 --> 25:03.905
and they wanted it badly.

25:04.750 --> 25:06.980
I told them that the key
was the wrist device...

25:08.020 --> 25:11.183
but I couldn't get it out of there,
at least not through the front door.

25:11.256 --> 25:13.156
What do you mean?

25:13.225 --> 25:16.626
One day I was in the lab
working on the adapter...

25:17.296 --> 25:20.094
the next thing I know,
I found myself on the ship.

25:20.165 --> 25:23.293
I had remotely activated
the transport beam.

25:23.368 --> 25:25.495
Which you failed to report.

25:28.273 --> 25:32.403
It was killing me that I wasn't able
to tell anybody I'd figured it out.

25:33.579 --> 25:35.479
I had to keep telling them
it wasn't working.

25:36.315 --> 25:39.978
Anyway, after that, I went
back and forth half a dozen times.

25:40.052 --> 25:43.852
But at the end of the day, the wrist
device was always back where it belonged.

25:43.922 --> 25:46.857
And you beamed the others up
using locator beacons.

25:46.925 --> 25:49.621
The beam was the only thing that
worked without the command codes.

25:50.863 --> 25:52.558
And that's where you came in.

25:54.433 --> 25:55.923
The translation.

25:58.303 --> 26:00.237
Osiris worked for Anubis...

26:00.305 --> 26:04.298
and Anubis had all his command codes
translated into Ancient.

26:05.444 --> 26:09.540
Once they had full control of the ship,
thanks to you, they had no need for me.

26:09.615 --> 26:13.415
They kept a permanent presence
up there, <i>2 4-7. Worked in shifts.</i>

26:14.319 --> 26:17.550
I went back to Area 51
and sabotaged the adapter.

26:18.824 --> 26:20.951
The project was shelved,
and no one was the wiser.

26:23.328 --> 26:25.455
Can you get the wrist device
to work again?

26:26.198 --> 26:27.688
Absolutely.

26:39.144 --> 26:41.874
Launch window in three minutes.
Ready for upgrade.

26:41.947 --> 26:44.040
Get down to the engine room.
Check the power relays.

26:44.116 --> 26:45.606
Yes, sir.

26:47.352 --> 26:48.842
Sir.

26:52.024 --> 26:54.652
Colonel Carter.
Welcome aboard.

26:55.394 --> 26:56.827
Where are we?

26:56.895 --> 26:59.955
We're in a polar orbit around the moon.
Cloaked, of course.

27:01.700 --> 27:03.634
This is the ship
Osiris left behind.

27:03.702 --> 27:05.636
We really have to thank you.

27:05.704 --> 27:08.070
If you hadn't caught her,
we never would've had this opportunity.

27:08.140 --> 27:09.801
You know they're gonna
come after you.

27:10.809 --> 27:12.674
<i>Prometheus</i> is undergoing a refit.

27:12.744 --> 27:14.609
They still have
sub-light engines.

27:14.680 --> 27:17.410
Once they realize you're
in a ship, they'll launch.

27:17.482 --> 27:20.246
And even with a cloak,
you're giving off an energy signature.

27:20.319 --> 27:22.753
We're operating
at minimal power.

27:22.821 --> 27:26.655
Maybe after a year of intensive scans,
they might be able to find us...

27:26.725 --> 27:28.920
but this won't
take that long.

27:28.994 --> 27:31.656
You're gonna launch a chemical attack
against the Goa'uld.

27:31.730 --> 27:35.962
We already have.
We're starting with Ba'al's territory...

27:36.034 --> 27:38.025
since he's the most
immediate threat right now.

27:39.371 --> 27:41.931
You realize you're killing
millions of innocentJaffa.

27:42.007 --> 27:45.841
Spare me, Colonel.
TheJaffa are a race of warriors...

27:45.911 --> 27:49.677
bred specifically to serve the Goa'uld
and enslave humans throughout the galaxy.

27:49.748 --> 27:53.309
They're indoctrinated from childhood to
believe that the Goa'uld are their gods.

27:53.385 --> 27:56.821
- They don't have a choice.
- So they're just following orders, right?

27:56.888 --> 27:58.515
Where've I heard
that argument before?

27:59.858 --> 28:03.453
What about the rebelJaffa?
They're growing in numbers every day.

28:03.528 --> 28:05.291
We consider them...

28:06.365 --> 28:08.128
acceptable losses.

28:08.200 --> 28:09.394
It's very simple, Colonel.

28:10.469 --> 28:12.528
Earth faces an imminent threat...

28:12.604 --> 28:15.402
and we have a weapon
that can eliminate that threat.

28:16.174 --> 28:17.664
We intend to use it.

28:20.045 --> 28:21.740
We're ready.

28:23.949 --> 28:25.780
What's the next target?

28:27.886 --> 28:29.911
P3S-114.

28:30.889 --> 28:32.015
Dial it.

28:33.625 --> 28:35.115
Yes, sir.

28:41.933 --> 28:45.596
You force me to choose
between abandoning my mission...

28:45.670 --> 28:48.002
and allowing you to die.

28:48.073 --> 28:51.304
I would worry more about
my own life if I were you, Tok'ra.

28:56.448 --> 28:58.006
I feel as you do, brother...

29:00.185 --> 29:02.346
but this is not the way.

29:13.698 --> 29:16.599
- Why are you here?
- We know about the attacks.

29:17.402 --> 29:18.733
What attacks?

29:18.804 --> 29:22.103
The Tok'ra have been using
symbiote poison against the Goa'uld.

29:22.174 --> 29:24.768
TheJaffa of three worlds
have been annihilated thus far.

29:25.510 --> 29:28.570
- Impossible.
- We have seen it with our own eyes-

29:28.647 --> 29:34.085
an entireJaffa army lying dead
with no wounds, no signs of battle.

29:34.152 --> 29:36.086
How do you explain this?

29:36.154 --> 29:41.649
I cannot, but I can assure you
that the Tok'ra are not responsible.

29:42.461 --> 29:46.227
If these attacks had been planned,
I would have been informed.

29:55.474 --> 29:57.772
Initiating launch sequence.

29:57.843 --> 30:00.403
You can't do this.
It's murder.

30:00.479 --> 30:03.209
That's where you're wrong,
Colonel. It's war.

30:03.281 --> 30:06.808
Launching in
three, two, one.

30:26.571 --> 30:28.596
What was that?

30:32.110 --> 30:34.169
My lord,
we are under attack.

30:34.246 --> 30:37.238
- How?
- A weapon was fired through the gate.

30:37.315 --> 30:39.180
It exploded over the city-

30:40.185 --> 30:41.982
Lord Zarin.

30:52.697 --> 30:55.461
Brothers, we must leave immediately.

30:58.703 --> 31:01.297
You are not going
anywhere <i>shol'va.</i>

31:01.373 --> 31:03.204
You do not understand.

31:11.816 --> 31:13.807
There may still be time.

31:22.594 --> 31:24.721
I die free.

31:32.871 --> 31:34.361
Indeed.

32:03.368 --> 32:06.633
Sensor grid R-14
shows no anomalies, sir.

32:06.705 --> 32:08.764
Very well, proceed to
the next grid.

32:08.840 --> 32:11.673
- Yes, sir.
- She's out there somewhere.

32:24.656 --> 32:26.624
Make it work.

32:28.460 --> 32:32.897
Our next target
is... P5R-357.

32:32.964 --> 32:35.228
- Let's do it.
- I wouldn't bother.

32:36.968 --> 32:38.993
Ba'al abandoned that planet
six months ago...

32:39.070 --> 32:41.061
when the naquadah mines
went dry.

32:42.173 --> 32:43.640
She's lying.

32:43.708 --> 32:46.302
Go ahead,
waste another rocket.

32:46.378 --> 32:48.471
That's one less planet
you'll be able to destroy.

32:51.516 --> 32:55.077
She does have more
up-to-date intelligence.

32:57.489 --> 32:58.820
She's bluffing.

32:58.890 --> 33:03.350
You could make this a lot less painful
if you help us select optimum targets.

33:04.629 --> 33:06.096
What are you talking about?

33:06.164 --> 33:08.928
You know as much about the current
tactical and strategic positions...

33:09.000 --> 33:11.161
of the different
system lords as anyone on Earth.

33:11.236 --> 33:12.999
I don't know as much
as you think.

33:13.071 --> 33:17.531
You know enough to help us get maximum
effect with minimum collateral damage.

33:17.609 --> 33:20.169
You're the one who wants
to save innocent lives.

33:22.447 --> 33:23.846
Nice try.

33:25.450 --> 33:26.439
So...

33:27.519 --> 33:30.113
are we going
for P5R-357 or not?

33:35.593 --> 33:37.527
Go to the next one
on the list.

33:56.147 --> 33:57.739
All right.

33:57.816 --> 34:00.148
Tell me again why
I should agree to this.

34:00.218 --> 34:03.381
It's the only way we have to get on the
ship, and if they've changed the codes...

34:03.455 --> 34:06.151
I'm the one who has the best chance
to decipher the Ancient symbols.

34:06.224 --> 34:08.488
If there are 10 armed goons
when you get there...

34:08.560 --> 34:10.653
you're the one
that's gonna... get-

34:13.264 --> 34:14.754
Better ideas?

34:16.134 --> 34:18.500
Look, Daniel, just because
I don't have a better idea...

34:18.570 --> 34:20.060
is no reason
to do anything.

34:23.908 --> 34:25.671
Look, once I shut down the cloak...

34:25.744 --> 34:27.871
<i>Prometheus</i> will be able
to pinpoint the ship's location.

34:27.946 --> 34:30.847
Then all I have to do is disable the
hyperdrive and... wait for the cavalry.

34:30.915 --> 34:34.351
- They'll never see it coming.
- Which is one of the advantages...

34:34.419 --> 34:36.444
of a totally insane idea.

34:36.521 --> 34:38.455
Yeah, where did
I learn that from?

34:41.426 --> 34:42.358
Okay.

35:01.246 --> 35:02.543
See you soon.

35:29.174 --> 35:30.766
Come on.

35:33.912 --> 35:35.675
Fine.

35:56.835 --> 35:58.826
Sir, we have something.
Definitely a ship.

35:58.903 --> 36:01.838
Bearings 157 by <i>229.</i>
500,000 kilometers.

36:01.906 --> 36:03.840
Battle stations.

36:03.908 --> 36:05.808
- Plot an intercept course.
- Yes, sir.

36:05.877 --> 36:08.607
- General O'Neill, this is <i>Prometheus.</i>
- Go ahead.

36:08.680 --> 36:10.443
<i>Looks like Dr. Jackson</i>
<i>pulled it off, sir.</i>

36:10.515 --> 36:12.676
We have them on our screens,
and we're moving in.

36:12.750 --> 36:14.513
Understood.

36:25.597 --> 36:30.193
We've got a problem. I just monitored
a 60% drop in our power consumption.

36:30.268 --> 36:33.203
The cloak.
Stay with her.

37:05.470 --> 37:07.700
Get up to the bridge.
Get that cloak back on-line.

37:07.772 --> 37:09.262
Yes, sir.

37:16.114 --> 37:18.082
We're in weapons range, sir.

37:18.149 --> 37:20.709
- Have they noticed us yet?
- I don't think so.

37:20.785 --> 37:23.913
They seem to be operating at minimal
power. No evasive maneuvers.

37:23.988 --> 37:27.719
- What about the hyperdrive?
- Still no signal from Dr. Jackson.

37:28.860 --> 37:30.384
General O'Neill,
we have a problem.

37:30.461 --> 37:32.486
<i>The ship's cloak is down,</i>
<i>sir, but Dr. Jackson...</i>

37:32.564 --> 37:35.124
<i>has yet to confirm whether he has</i>
<i>disabled the hyperdrive or not.</i>

37:36.701 --> 37:38.726
Just give him
a little more time.

37:38.803 --> 37:40.964
Right now, sir,
they are sitting ducks.

37:41.039 --> 37:43.530
If they spot us, they can run,
and we won't be able to catch them.

37:43.608 --> 37:45.633
<i>We can't afford to</i>
<i>let them get away, General.</i>

37:45.710 --> 37:48.304
<i>I recommend we</i>
<i>open fire immediately.</i>

37:51.449 --> 37:53.383
General, please advise.

38:23.681 --> 38:25.945
Where the hell
did he come from?

38:26.017 --> 38:27.780
He had the wrist device.

38:27.852 --> 38:29.979
Any chance there's more
of them on board?

38:30.054 --> 38:32.147
It only lets one person
up at a time.

38:32.223 --> 38:34.953
- <i>Hoskins, this is Brooks.</i>
- Go ahead.

38:35.026 --> 38:39.258
The cloak's been disabled. I don't know
if I can get it back on-line.

38:40.264 --> 38:43.028
This position is compromised.
We need to get out of here now.

38:43.101 --> 38:45.331
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- What about them?

38:45.403 --> 38:48.736
- We can't take them with us.
- I don't mind going for a little ride.

38:48.806 --> 38:49.795
Me neither.

38:52.810 --> 38:55.005
Sorry about this,
Dr. Jackson.

38:59.651 --> 39:01.141
Incoming.

39:09.927 --> 39:11.326
<i>This is Teal'c of SG-1.</i>

39:13.231 --> 39:15.131
<i>Please respond.</i>

39:15.199 --> 39:18.032
<i>This is Teal'c of SG-1.</i>

39:18.936 --> 39:22.030
<i>Repeat, this is Teal'c.</i>
<i>Does anyone read?</i>

39:23.207 --> 39:25.675
- <i>Repeat, this is Teal'c.</i>
- Teal'c, this is Daniel!

39:25.743 --> 39:27.574
We need your help!
Come on through!

39:45.396 --> 39:47.557
Somebody wanna untie me?

39:47.632 --> 39:49.657
<i>Cargo hold,</i>
<i>what's happening down there?</i>

39:51.869 --> 39:53.837
<i>Cargo hold, respond.</i>

39:55.707 --> 39:57.937
<i>Jennings, Hoskins,</i>
<i>where the hell are you?</i>

40:21.365 --> 40:22.855
What's happening?

40:30.875 --> 40:33.673
She's bringing the hyperdrive on line.
Get to the gate.

40:43.454 --> 40:46.446
- They're trying to run, sir.
- Damn it.

40:46.524 --> 40:49.084
General O'Neill, they are
powering up their hyperdrive.

40:49.160 --> 40:50.650
<i>We are out of options.</i>

40:50.728 --> 40:52.821
Can you disable the ship
without destroying it?

40:52.897 --> 40:55.058
I cannot give you
any guarantees.

41:02.640 --> 41:05.438
Sir, we're picking up a signal
coming from inside the ship.

41:05.510 --> 41:08.274
- What is it?
- Locator beacon, sir. Same frequency.

41:08.346 --> 41:10.906
Lock on the signal.
Activate transport beam.

41:10.982 --> 41:12.506
Beam activated.

41:21.793 --> 41:24.626
- The ship's gone, sir.
- Cargo bay, report.

41:24.695 --> 41:26.822
<i>This is cargo bay.</i>
<i>We have the gate, sir...</i>

41:26.898 --> 41:29.162
<i>as well as Teal'c,</i>
<i>Colonel Carter and Dr. Jackson.</i>

41:31.569 --> 41:33.059
Acknowledged.

41:33.871 --> 41:36.704
General O'Neill,
it looks like you were right.

41:36.774 --> 41:41.074
<i>We have the gate and SG-1 aboard.</i>
<i>They are alive.</i>

41:42.346 --> 41:44.371
That's good news.

41:45.850 --> 41:47.477
Bring 'em home.

41:47.552 --> 41:49.042
Yes, sir.

42:07.939 --> 42:11.033
The good news is the gate
is fully operational again.

42:11.108 --> 42:13.576
We can resume
off-world missions immediately.

42:13.644 --> 42:15.305
And the bad news is
The Trust now has...

42:15.379 --> 42:17.574
a fully functional
Goa'uld Al'kesh.

42:17.648 --> 42:19.843
We've installed jamming
devices around the gate...

42:19.917 --> 42:22.511
to prevent any locator beams
from operating in the future.

42:22.587 --> 42:24.487
What of the Tok'ra poison?

42:24.555 --> 42:27.251
Well, they left most of it behind,
but they still have enough...

42:27.325 --> 42:29.520
to wipe out at least
half a dozen Goa'uld worlds.

42:30.895 --> 42:34.194
In retrospect, maybe you should've
destroyed the ship when you had a chance.

42:35.566 --> 42:37.056
Yeah.

42:38.536 --> 42:40.128
Tough choice.
