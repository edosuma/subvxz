WEBVTT

00:08.617 --> 00:09.537
What are you doing?

00:09.657 --> 00:11.204
I got a tickle, a
really bad one.

00:11.205 --> 00:12.157
Oh, shit, are you getting sick?

00:12.158 --> 00:13.615
If you're getting sick, stay
away from us.

00:13.616 --> 00:15.308
N-N-N-No, I'd better not be
getting sick.

00:15.309 --> 00:16.174
I can't be getting sick.

00:16.175 --> 00:17.892
I got to be able to talk to
Groban tomorrow.

00:17.893 --> 00:18.979
Who?
Josh Groban.

00:18.980 --> 00:21.215
Artemis and I got backstage
passes to his concert in the

00:21.216 --> 00:22.149
park tomorrow.

00:22.150 --> 00:24.451
Charles Grodin is coming in
concert and you didn't tell us?

00:24.452 --> 00:28.456
Aw, we love Charles Grodin.
That dude is hysteri... I love that guy.

00:28.576 --> 00:29.990
He brings out the curmudgeon
in me. Yeah.

00:29.991 --> 00:32.893
No, no, different guy.
Josh Groban is who I'm talking about.

00:32.894 --> 00:34.962
Josh Groban, oh.
Is he Charles Grodin's son?

00:34.963 --> 00:36.296
He's probably funny.
What do you think?

00:36.297 --> 00:38.999
If he's related to Charles Grodin,
he is. Don't worry about that.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.001
Yeah, two totally different people.

00:41.002 --> 00:43.904
Charles Grodin is a bitter old
man with a giant head, and Josh

00:43.905 --> 00:46.940
Groban is a beautiful singer
with the voice of an angel.

00:46.941 --> 00:48.842
Oh, he's a singer.
Call Charles Grodin a bitter

00:48.843 --> 00:50.844
old man one more time and see
what happens!

00:50.845 --> 00:51.845
Ooh, ooh, calm down.

00:51.846 --> 00:54.314
All right, all right, sorry,
all right, no big deal.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.283
I got to go home anyway.
I should rest.

00:56.284 --> 00:59.160
Stay... come on.
No, don't come near me.

00:59.161 --> 01:00.854
Don't make me sick. All right,
all right, don't touch me with that.

01:00.855 --> 01:02.756
Don't make me sick. Get out!
Hey, stop it.

01:02.757 --> 01:05.864
Mom, Mom, calm down,
calm down, listen to me.

01:05.865 --> 01:07.227
Okay, here's what you do, okay?

01:07.228 --> 01:10.697
You close the curtains and you
mind your own business, right?

01:10.698 --> 01:13.233
They're not terrorists!
They're just Muslims.

01:13.234 --> 01:17.070
Okay, well, I'm gonna hang up,
okay? Hanging up.

01:17.071 --> 01:18.071
Unbelievable, dude.

01:18.072 --> 01:20.274
Ever since my Uncle Jack moved
out, my mom's going crazy.

01:20.275 --> 01:22.676
She's like, "Help me with this,
help me with that, wash the

01:22.677 --> 01:25.345
floor, wash the ceiling, clean
my car, get this, fix that.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.714
Are there spiders here?
Are there spiders there?"

01:27.715 --> 01:29.983
I'm sorry, the woman who
brought you into the world and

01:29.984 --> 01:32.319
raised you needs you and you're
going to ignore her?

01:32.320 --> 01:34.925
Dude, it's crazy shit, it's
insane shit, and I can't be

01:34.926 --> 01:37.011
constantly taking care of her.
I don't blame you, man.

01:37.012 --> 01:40.208
I'm very much looking forward to not
taking care of anyone when I'm older.

01:40.209 --> 01:43.038
Well, what, what, you're not going
to take care of me when I'm old?

01:43.039 --> 01:44.763
Hell, no, I'm not going to
take care of you; you were a

01:44.764 --> 01:47.275
terrible father to me.
Oh, I'll get Deandra to take care of me.

01:47.395 --> 01:49.160
- She'll take care of me.
- Dee won't take care of you.

01:49.194 --> 01:51.838
You just chased her out of here with
a poolcue because she had a little cough.

01:51.839 --> 01:53.607
Forget about it.

01:53.608 --> 01:56.183
That's her.
Answer the phone, Charlie.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.670
I'm just going to let it ring
'cause it's crazy shit.

01:57.671 --> 01:59.372
Charlie, answer the goddamn
phone! Just...

01:59.373 --> 02:01.091
It's not anything serious, Mac!

02:01.092 --> 02:03.073
What?!
Hello, what, what is it?

02:04.309 --> 02:08.155
Yeah.
Oh, well, that is a serious thing.

02:08.156 --> 02:11.844
Okay, I'll let him know. Uh, Mac,
your mom burned her house down.

Hey-o!

02:50.315 --> 02:51.582
Good news, Dennis.

02:51.583 --> 02:53.514
Mom's okay.

02:53.518 --> 02:55.586
She fell asleep with a lit
cigarette in her mouth and

02:55.587 --> 02:58.322
burned the entire house down,
but the good news is she's fine.

02:58.323 --> 03:01.425
Uh, oh, great. Yeah.

03:01.426 --> 03:04.128
Um, where is she going to be
staying?

03:04.129 --> 03:06.730
Here, of course.
I'll stay in a shelter.

03:06.731 --> 03:09.700
Hey, there's an idea... shelter.
Absolutely not.

03:09.701 --> 03:12.469
Okay, what about a nice
nursing home? Nursing home?

03:12.470 --> 03:15.323
Do you have any idea what
happens in those places, dude?

03:15.324 --> 03:16.747
Why don't I just rape her
myself?

03:16.748 --> 03:18.542
Rape her... what are you
talking about? What?

03:18.543 --> 03:20.944
Yo, got your dog.

03:20.945 --> 03:23.647
Poppins, hey, buddy, how you
doing?

03:23.648 --> 03:24.848
Poppins.

03:24.849 --> 03:26.450
My God, I can't believe
that dog's not dead.

03:26.451 --> 03:28.118
Didn't you get him when
you were, like, ten?

03:28.119 --> 03:30.721
Oh, yeah, this dog is
indestructible, dude.

03:31.488 --> 03:32.722
Yeah, that dog is nasty, man.

03:32.723 --> 03:34.424
I mean, he was, like, coughing
the whole way over here.

03:34.425 --> 03:36.025
He ate a couple cigarette
butts off the ground.

03:36.026 --> 03:36.692
He's got a wheeze.

03:36.693 --> 03:37.960
He might have emphysema, man.

03:37.961 --> 03:38.761
Oh, that's entirely possible.

03:38.762 --> 03:42.031
Yeah, it wouldn't slow him
down, though; he's a survivor.

03:42.032 --> 03:43.733
He would disappear for months,
but he would always come home.

03:43.734 --> 03:45.334
Yeah, it looks like his
eye is falling out.

03:45.335 --> 03:46.002
Oh, is it?

03:46.003 --> 03:46.669
What, it just bulges?

03:46.670 --> 03:48.271
Yeah, it bulges out
a little bit there.

03:48.272 --> 03:50.824
Yeah, what you do is
you just pop it back with your knuckle.

03:50.944 --> 03:53.681
- I'll show you how to do it. It's real easy.
- I'm never gonna do that,

03:53.801 --> 03:55.711
You're gonna touch his
eye with your knuckle?

03:55.712 --> 03:57.281
You just, you just sort
of pop it back in.

03:57.282 --> 03:58.679
Oh, hang on a second.

03:58.799 --> 04:00.884
What, Mom, what?

04:00.885 --> 04:03.253
I'm not going to vacuum your ceiling.

04:03.254 --> 04:05.643
Um, 'cause I already did it, okay?!

04:05.763 --> 04:06.339
Dude!

04:06.573 --> 04:09.929
Plastic splinters are the same
as... you won't get a splinter!

04:11.322 --> 04:12.679
I got to go deal with this, man.

04:12.707 --> 04:13.579
My mom wants me to...
No, no, no, no, no, no,

04:13.627 --> 04:14.302
wait, hold on a second.

04:14.348 --> 04:15.212
It's back in, Dennis, check it out.

04:15.265 --> 04:15.931
I don't care.

04:15.932 --> 04:17.933
I have an idea that's going to
solve all of our problems here,

04:17.934 --> 04:18.600
I do.

04:18.601 --> 04:20.603
Your moms are going to live together.
Now hear me out.

04:20.603 --> 04:21.571
This is going to be great.

04:21.572 --> 04:23.807
Okay, Mac, your mom burned down
her house with a cigarette,

04:23.808 --> 04:24.374
right?

04:24.375 --> 04:26.543
Charlie, Uncle Jack moved out
of your mom's house, so she's

04:26.544 --> 04:28.244
lonely, she's got no one to talk to.

04:28.245 --> 04:30.280
Boom... Mrs.
Mac, your mom together.

04:30.281 --> 04:31.281
Could be the perfect situation.

04:31.282 --> 04:32.282
Come on.

04:32.283 --> 04:33.458
They could be like
The Golden Girls.

04:33.578 --> 04:34.779
You know, a couple of old ladies

04:34.824 --> 04:37.075
getting together, chasing
men, eating cheesecake.

04:37.195 --> 04:38.029
That'd be cool.

04:38.149 --> 04:39.289
Sure, whatever.

04:39.290 --> 04:40.223
I'm loving that idea, but my

04:40.224 --> 04:42.292
mom's going to be a
tough sell, man.

04:42.293 --> 04:43.293
Uh-huh.

04:43.294 --> 04:44.260
I'll talk her into it.

04:44.261 --> 04:45.829
Oh, it popped back out.

04:52.988 --> 04:55.140
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

04:55.560 --> 04:56.493
What the hell are you doing?

04:56.494 --> 04:57.887
Oh, I went to the
health food store.

04:58.007 --> 04:59.111
I just grabbed a whole
bunch of shit.

04:59.231 --> 05:00.869
It's supposed to boost
my immune system.

05:00.989 --> 05:02.425
I'm not going to miss
that show, Frank.

05:02.545 --> 05:03.522
I'm a Grobanite.

05:03.642 --> 05:04.817
Grobanites don't miss shows.

05:04.937 --> 05:07.610
Josh Groban comes to town and we
consider it a call to action.

05:07.870 --> 05:09.769
What you're saying
is very dorky.

05:09.889 --> 05:14.935
Nevertheless, I brought you some
stuff... a little bit of care package here.

05:15.055 --> 05:16.891
Why?
I wanna make you well.

05:17.148 --> 05:19.835
Coffee, I got you some Mexican peanuts...

05:20.102 --> 05:21.579
I got you some candy...

05:21.860 --> 05:23.450
I got you Stud magazine.

05:23.570 --> 05:25.250
What's your angle?
What are you doing?

05:25.543 --> 05:26.527
Deandra..

05:27.744 --> 05:29.235
We have to take care of each other.

05:29.355 --> 05:30.881
I'm gonna take care of you now

05:31.001 --> 05:32.235
and when I'm old and sick,

05:32.355 --> 05:33.980
- you have to take care of me.
- What?

05:34.100 --> 05:37.423
No, no. I'm not doing that. Absolutely not.
You're on your own.

05:37.543 --> 05:39.412
But... You ok?

05:39.532 --> 05:42.561
Yeah? No? Sit down.

05:42.681 --> 05:44.567
Open up. Put your head back.

05:45.254 --> 05:47.178
Oh, God. Ugh.

05:48.375 --> 05:49.473
Oh God.

05:49.593 --> 05:52.518
- Oh my God. - Look, you know what?
You should go relax.

05:52.638 --> 05:54.024
You should go rest now.

05:54.144 --> 05:55.997
Ok, look. I'm gonna do anything you need.

05:56.117 --> 05:57.685
Anything you need, I will do it.

05:58.076 --> 06:00.495
- Just make believe I'm your slave.
- Okay.

06:01.276 --> 06:02.401
Do my laundry.

06:04.012 --> 06:05.446
- Done.
- Alright.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.669
- I'm gonna go rest. Don't bother me.
- Alright.

06:07.789 --> 06:09.832
No, no, no. I'm gonna be
as quiet as a mouse.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.098
You just rest, honey.

06:11.218 --> 06:12.155
Mm-hmm.

06:12.275 --> 06:16.150
♪ ♪

06:20.592 --> 06:21.859
Okay, all right.

06:21.860 --> 06:24.595
Well, ladies, I know this is a
lot to digest, and that's why

06:24.596 --> 06:27.998
I'm here... to act as an unbiased
negotiator in the process, and

06:27.999 --> 06:31.135
to sort out any
problems or concerns.

06:31.136 --> 06:33.871
Essentially just to make sure
that you're both comfortable

06:33.872 --> 06:35.470
with this new arrangement.

06:37.608 --> 06:39.409
I don't want to le with her.

06:39.410 --> 06:40.443
Oh! Mom, why not?!

06:40.444 --> 06:41.444
She smells.

06:41.445 --> 06:42.445
I know she smells.

06:42.446 --> 06:44.811
All right... Okay, you can't
talk about my mom like that.

06:44.931 --> 06:46.728
Okay... You don't smell, and
you look beautiful, okay?

06:46.848 --> 06:50.835
Okay, I think what Charlie's
mom is trying to say is that

06:50.955 --> 06:54.624
Mrs. Mac has a unique
and earthy fragrance.

06:54.625 --> 06:55.625
I smell like shit.

06:55.626 --> 06:57.994
Okay, Mom, don't put
yourself down, okay?

06:57.995 --> 06:58.995
We talked about this.

06:58.996 --> 07:01.030
You know, perhaps we could get Mrs.
Mac some perfume?

07:01.031 --> 07:02.098
Oh, that's not a bad idea.

07:02.099 --> 07:03.299
Mrs. Mac, what do you say?

07:03.300 --> 07:04.300
What better way to kick off this

07:04.301 --> 07:06.302
new relationship than
with a new fragrance?

07:06.303 --> 07:08.304
Stop talking to me
like I'm an asshole.

07:08.305 --> 07:09.305
Yeah.

07:09.306 --> 07:10.306
She can't smoke in here.

07:10.307 --> 07:12.842
I know, Mom. Uh...
Okay, okay, okay, well,

07:12.843 --> 07:15.545
that's... Well, now, Mrs.
Mac, I would never ask you to give up

07:15.546 --> 07:18.081
tobacco, but what if you were to
switch to some sort of smokeless

07:18.082 --> 07:19.082
tobacco alternative?

07:19.083 --> 07:21.351
Ugh!

07:21.352 --> 07:22.352
I know that grunt.

07:22.353 --> 07:23.786
She's open to it.

07:23.787 --> 07:24.854
Okay, so what do we say, we

07:24.855 --> 07:27.123
do a little bit of a
trial run tonight?

07:27.124 --> 07:29.150
Let's see what happens, and
then we'll take it from there.

07:30.555 --> 07:31.575
Okay.

07:34.596 --> 07:37.039
- That means absolutely.
- Okay.

07:37.159 --> 07:38.333
Great, great, great.

07:38.453 --> 07:40.998
So, last step. Dog's tied up outside.
I'll grab him

07:41.118 --> 07:43.279
- and get him inside and be on my way.
- No, no, no dog.

07:43.399 --> 07:47.208
- Charlie, tell them.
- Ok, she is terrified of

07:47.477 --> 07:50.543
animals eating her face off...

07:50.663 --> 07:52.679
I don't want a dog to eat my face, Charlie.

07:52.799 --> 07:54.859
- You want a dog eating her face?
- Well, you know,

07:54.979 --> 07:56.941
That's not a problem.
We'll take the dog.

07:57.061 --> 07:59.933
Oh, what I think Mac is trying to say...

08:00.053 --> 08:02.996
- is not that we'll take the dog...
- I'm saying exactly what I wanna say.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.325
What I'm trying to say now is that
we're taking the dog.

08:05.372 --> 08:06.915
What I'm trying to say, Frank...

08:07.109 --> 08:08.012
We're taking the dog.

08:08.132 --> 08:09.234
We're not taking the dog...

08:09.270 --> 08:10.754
He's not going to eat

08:10.874 --> 08:13.297
- my mother's face off.
- He's gonna be home with us.

08:13.417 --> 08:15.573
Alright, alright, alright!

08:15.693 --> 08:17.514
Fine, we'll take the dog.

08:25.052 --> 08:27.031
Laundry's done.

08:27.151 --> 08:28.185
Uh, those white shorts on top?

08:28.186 --> 08:30.254
That's part of my outfit for
tomorrow, so why don't you go

08:30.255 --> 08:31.255
and run an iron over those?

08:31.256 --> 08:33.524
Oh! Hey, very whitey white.

08:33.525 --> 08:35.926
Uh, you're not ragging
it, are you?

08:35.927 --> 08:36.927
What?!

08:36.928 --> 08:37.928
What? Gross, Frank.

08:37.929 --> 08:38.929
Come on.

08:38.929 --> 08:39.929
You still get periods?

08:39.931 --> 08:40.931
What are you doing?

08:40.932 --> 08:41.932
Stop asking me that.

08:41.933 --> 08:42.933
What? Gross! Come on.

08:42.933 --> 08:43.933
I'm trying to bond with you.

08:43.934 --> 08:44.969
That's how you want to bond

08:44.970 --> 08:46.971
with me... asking me if
I still get periods?

08:46.972 --> 08:48.973
What's that stuff
you're putting on?

08:48.974 --> 08:50.007
That's beautiful. What is it?

08:50.008 --> 08:52.009
Self tanner. For tomorrow.

08:52.010 --> 08:54.011
Got to look good for Groban.

08:54.012 --> 08:56.013
The, uh, tan's gonna make the
white in the outfit pop, the

08:56.014 --> 08:57.014
white's gonna make the tan pop.

08:57.015 --> 08:59.016
Josh Groban likes his
ladies to pop, so...

08:59.017 --> 09:01.685
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
look who I brought.

09:01.686 --> 09:02.853
It's Poppins! Yeah.

09:02.854 --> 09:03.854
Oh, God.

09:05.175 --> 09:06.175
That's Poppins?

09:06.176 --> 09:07.176
Ooh. Yeah.

09:07.177 --> 09:08.177
He's still alive?

09:08.178 --> 09:09.145
Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:09.146 --> 09:10.980
I figured he could keep you
company while you're sick.

09:10.981 --> 09:11.981
Oh.

09:11.982 --> 09:13.783
Dog looks like a gargoyle.

09:13.784 --> 09:15.551
Yeah. He smells like piss.

09:15.552 --> 09:16.652
Uh-huh.

09:16.653 --> 09:17.653
Does it? Uh, uh-oh.

09:17.654 --> 09:18.521
Is he dying?

09:18.522 --> 09:19.522
No, no, no, he's fine.

09:19.523 --> 09:21.223
Uh, by the way, you're gonna
want to keep him away from that

09:21.224 --> 09:23.025
cream, too, 'cause
he'll eat that shit.

09:23.026 --> 09:24.375
Yeah, he ate a whole bottle of
shampoo at our apartment earlier.

09:24.376 --> 09:25.209
He loves shit like that.

09:25.210 --> 09:25.709
Wow.

09:25.710 --> 09:26.477
Yeah.

09:26.478 --> 09:28.479
Sounds great.
Thanks for bringing him over, yeah.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.113
Great dog.

09:29.114 --> 09:29.880
He's a great dog.

09:29.881 --> 09:31.815
I'm gonna finish this
up in my bedroom.

09:31.816 --> 09:32.834
Frank, why don't you
make me another juice?

09:32.954 --> 09:35.238
- 'Cause I feel like that green
stuff's really working. - You got it.

09:35.358 --> 09:38.553
Great. So, you'll keep the
dog here, and then, uh...

09:38.556 --> 09:39.556
What are you doing, Frank?

09:39.557 --> 09:40.524
What's going on here?

09:40.525 --> 09:42.526
Trying to score brownie
points with your sister.

09:42.527 --> 09:43.527
I mean, I need somebody to take

09:43.528 --> 09:45.396
care of me when I'm
old and sick.

09:45.397 --> 09:47.264
Oh, Jesus, you're still
worried about that?

09:47.265 --> 09:50.000
Why don't you just check yourself
into a nursing home, Frank?

09:50.001 --> 09:51.001
You have the money.

09:51.002 --> 09:52.936
I'm not gonna put myself
into one of those crypts.

09:52.937 --> 09:54.805
As soon as you drop the
soap, they rape your butt.

09:54.806 --> 09:55.806
What?

09:55.807 --> 09:56.807
That's what happens.

09:56.808 --> 09:57.808
Mac told me.

09:57.809 --> 09:59.610
What are you...? God...
People have a very strange

09:59.611 --> 10:01.412
conception of what goes
on in nursing homes.

10:01.413 --> 10:02.413
Frank, green juice, now!

10:02.414 --> 10:04.782
The bitch is driving me crazy!

10:04.783 --> 10:07.117
She's not even sick anymore.

10:07.118 --> 10:09.219
You know, I support your
plan, Frank, in so far as it

10:09.220 --> 10:11.688
insures that I won't have to
take care of you when you get

10:11.689 --> 10:13.757
older, but you're going about
this all wrong, honestly.

10:13.758 --> 10:14.758
How do you mean?

10:14.759 --> 10:16.760
Well, for one thing,
she's in her apartment.

10:16.761 --> 10:18.256
She's comfortable here.
She's on her home turf.

10:18.376 --> 10:20.507
She's got all her amenities,
she feels good here.

10:20.627 --> 10:21.956
She doesn't need you here.

10:22.076 --> 10:23.925
You need to thrust her
into a hostile environment.

10:24.045 --> 10:25.581
So that she needs you to protect her.

10:25.701 --> 10:27.410
I should dump her under the bridge.

10:27.530 --> 10:29.655
Dump her under the bridge? No,
don't dump her under the bridge.

10:29.715 --> 10:30.445
What are you talking about?
No.

10:30.472 --> 10:32.330
You need to be there, Frank.
That's the whole point.

10:32.450 --> 10:34.113
Just take her to your apartment, ok?

10:34.710 --> 10:36.443
Now, separately, if this is going to work,

10:36.563 --> 10:38.795
she's gonna need to feel a little bit
more than just a tickle on her throat.

10:39.051 --> 10:40.683
So if she's not feeling sick, well...

10:41.513 --> 10:44.249
Then we're just have
to make her feel sick.

10:45.221 --> 10:46.471
You're good.

10:46.472 --> 10:47.491
Well, I'm a fixer,
Frank, is what.

10:47.492 --> 10:48.225
You're good.

10:48.226 --> 10:49.326
That's what I do.

10:49.327 --> 10:51.662
Dennis, listen, we should
hang out more together.

10:51.663 --> 10:53.630
Yeah.
Stop trying to bond with me.

11:04.123 --> 11:06.457
They're not even
talking to each other.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.459
My mom's not very verbal.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.728
I know, but they haven't even
touched their cheesecake.

11:10.729 --> 11:12.730
I mean, I feel like if you and I
were in a room with a perfectly

11:12.731 --> 11:14.832
good cheesecake, all sorts
of conversation would start

11:14.833 --> 11:15.867
happening.

11:15.868 --> 11:18.269
Oh, Charlie, the funniest thing
happened today when I was

11:18.270 --> 11:18.870
doing the laundry.

11:18.871 --> 11:20.104
Mom, no, not me.

11:20.105 --> 11:21.406
You got to talk to her, okay?

11:21.407 --> 11:22.073
Don't talk to me.

11:22.074 --> 11:24.242
Yeah, pretend like we're not
even here, Mrs. Kelly, okay?

11:24.243 --> 11:25.043
Go gossip.

11:25.044 --> 11:26.311
About what?

11:26.312 --> 11:28.279
Maybe you were at a
supermarket one time, and you

11:28.280 --> 11:31.449
met a cute guy, and you were
feeling saucy, and then you

11:31.450 --> 11:33.651
wanted to go back and talk
to your friend, Sophia.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.820
So you're like Blanche
and she's like Sophia.

11:35.821 --> 11:36.521
So, go ahead.

11:36.522 --> 11:38.256
I don't go to the supermarket.

11:38.257 --> 11:39.824
The shopping carts are dangerous.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.592
Shopping carts are not dangerous, Mom.

11:41.593 --> 11:43.394
There's nothing dangerous
about a shopping cart!

11:43.395 --> 11:44.362
Let's try a new tack.

11:44.363 --> 11:45.363
Everybody, calm down.

11:45.364 --> 11:46.364
This isn't working. All right.

11:46.365 --> 11:47.965
TV's going off. Boom.

11:47.966 --> 11:49.567
Okay! That's good, right?

11:49.568 --> 11:51.302
You guys are roommates now,
so maybe you can get to know

11:51.303 --> 11:52.203
one another.

11:52.204 --> 11:52.937
I'm hot.

11:52.938 --> 11:53.638
My mom's hot.

11:53.639 --> 11:54.639
I'm hot, too.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.340
Okay, I got to be honest.

11:55.341 --> 11:56.040
I'm hot, as well.

11:56.041 --> 11:56.941
Can we turn the fan on?

11:56.942 --> 11:58.343
Okay, well, the fan is broken.

11:58.344 --> 11:59.344
It hasn't worked for years.

11:59.345 --> 12:01.379
Oh, oh, okay. That's good.

12:01.380 --> 12:02.814
My mom's very good with her hands.

12:02.815 --> 12:03.581
Maybe she can fix it.

12:03.582 --> 12:04.382
Oh, yeah?

12:04.383 --> 12:06.818
Mom was the manager at
Jiffy Lube for many years.

12:06.819 --> 12:08.152
I never heard about this.

12:08.153 --> 12:10.638
Yeah, well, she doesn't like to brag.
It's not her style.

12:10.758 --> 12:12.185
Yeah, but she started at the bottom,

12:12.305 --> 12:13.676
worked her way to the tippy top.

12:13.796 --> 12:15.760
Yeah, there was just
three people working at Jiffy Lube.

12:15.761 --> 12:16.761
It's not really a high climb.

12:16.762 --> 12:18.730
Okay, well, please don't
diminish my mother's

12:18.731 --> 12:19.564
achievements, okay?

12:19.565 --> 12:21.499
Well, don't get too excited about
your mother's achienevements.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.067
Okay, could you...
Mom, do you want to take a look

12:23.068 --> 12:24.736
at that fan, and see
if you can fix it?

12:25.904 --> 12:26.871
Hmm.

12:26.872 --> 12:27.405
What was that?

12:27.406 --> 12:29.674
It means, "Not right now, but
there's a possibility that I

12:29.675 --> 12:30.942
could get to it tomorrow."

12:30.943 --> 12:32.877
See, the problem is, once that
sun goes down, you're not going

12:32.878 --> 12:36.180
to get this woman to do anything
'cause she thrives on sunlight.

12:36.181 --> 12:37.915
She seems like she's
never been in sunlight.

12:40.152 --> 12:41.152
Oh!

12:41.153 --> 12:41.819
That's nasty.

12:41.820 --> 12:44.021
Oh, Charlie, she's spitting
into my porcelain.

12:44.022 --> 12:45.356
Okay, well, that makes you mad.

12:45.357 --> 12:46.591
Take it up with her!

12:46.592 --> 12:47.959
Have a conversation with her.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.161
Everybody, can we just...
Let's relax for a second.

12:50.162 --> 12:52.630
Maybe I can get you, like, a...
like, a beer bottle, would that

12:52.631 --> 12:53.131
be okay?

12:53.132 --> 12:54.365
An empty beer bottle to spit in?

12:54.366 --> 12:55.366
Yeah?

12:55.367 --> 12:56.868
Okay, having fun.

have to do this for?

13:48.120 --> 13:48.653
What do you mean?

13:48.654 --> 13:50.087
We've been here for,
like, an hour, Frank.

13:50.088 --> 13:50.988
You're the worst dad.

13:50.989 --> 13:52.690
Groban!

13:52.691 --> 13:53.691
She's up.

13:53.692 --> 13:54.692
I'll come find you.

13:54.693 --> 13:55.226
Okay.

13:55.227 --> 13:55.927
Daddy's here.

13:55.928 --> 13:56.761
Take it easy, honey.

13:56.762 --> 13:58.229
Okay, honey, don't get up.

13:58.230 --> 13:59.163
Stay right where you are.

13:59.164 --> 14:01.065
Don't go by the knives.

14:02.067 --> 14:02.967
Let me backstage.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.635
I think she's going backstage.

14:04.636 --> 14:05.503
: Going backstage.

14:05.504 --> 14:06.337
You sing so good.

14:06.338 --> 14:07.638
Honey, honey, you want a blanky?

14:07.639 --> 14:08.639
I'll swaddle you, baby.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.440
I'll get to you.

14:09.441 --> 14:10.475
No, no, tomorrow night.

14:10.476 --> 14:12.977
You sing in my ears.

14:12.978 --> 14:13.644
Where's she going?

14:13.645 --> 14:15.112
She thinks she's going to the concert?

14:15.113 --> 14:16.013
I don't know. She's walking.

14:16.014 --> 14:17.682
She's, like, in a zombie state.

14:17.683 --> 14:19.016
Ooh, she's going to
bounce off all the walls.

14:19.017 --> 14:20.251
I've never seen anything like this.

14:20.252 --> 14:21.118
It's incredible.

14:21.119 --> 14:23.287
Outside. She's going out.

14:23.288 --> 14:26.123
Ooh, she's going to
hit the skateboard.

14:26.124 --> 14:27.308
Ooh.

14:28.982 --> 14:31.410
Ah, did you see that? It's like Mr. Magoo.

14:37.803 --> 14:38.402
Ooh.

14:38.403 --> 14:39.337
Oh.

14:39.338 --> 14:41.172
Magoo never made that mistake.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.229
No.

14:43.179 --> 14:46.677
One... two... three.

14:47.713 --> 14:48.946
Good night, honey.

14:48.947 --> 14:50.248
Good night, Mac.

14:50.249 --> 14:51.115
One, two, three.

14:51.116 --> 14:52.083
One, two, three.

14:52.084 --> 14:53.451
One. Two. Three.

14:53.452 --> 14:54.919
One, two, three.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.420
One, two, three.

14:56.421 --> 14:58.356
One, two, three...
Mrs. Kelly?

14:58.357 --> 14:59.290
Yes?

14:59.291 --> 15:01.125
Why are you doing
everything in threes?

15:01.126 --> 15:04.095
Oh, so Charlie doesn't die.

15:04.096 --> 15:05.863
What?

15:05.864 --> 15:07.231
One, two, three.

15:07.232 --> 15:08.833
One, two, three.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.134
That's crazy.

15:10.135 --> 15:11.135
Bat shit crazy.

15:11.136 --> 15:12.136
I don't know what to do.

15:12.137 --> 15:13.104
What do you want me to say?

15:13.105 --> 15:14.639
The woman's out of her damn mind.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.475
Hey! Get the hell...
Is she waking up my mom?

15:17.476 --> 15:18.476
No!

15:18.477 --> 15:19.477
No!

15:19.478 --> 15:19.977
No, Mom!

15:19.978 --> 15:21.712
My mom does not like to
be woken up, Mrs. Kelly!

15:21.713 --> 15:23.447
Shit! Get out of my room.

15:23.448 --> 15:24.549
Just one more. One more.

15:24.550 --> 15:25.750
One, two, three.

15:25.751 --> 15:28.119
Get out of here, goddamn it!

15:28.921 --> 15:29.520
Whoa, whoa.

15:29.521 --> 15:30.454
Mom, go to bed!

15:30.455 --> 15:31.789
Oh, man, that was close.

15:31.790 --> 15:33.324
Now you see where I
get my temper, huh?

15:33.325 --> 15:34.091
Yeah, one, two, three.

15:34.092 --> 15:34.825
One, two, three.

15:35.794 --> 15:36.360
What are you doing?

15:36.361 --> 15:36.994
Huh?

15:36.995 --> 15:37.995
What was that?

15:37.996 --> 15:39.463
Oh, you know, just playing it safe.

15:39.464 --> 15:40.131
She's been doing it.

15:40.132 --> 15:40.665
I'm still alive.

15:40.666 --> 15:41.666
Can't be crazy.

15:41.667 --> 15:42.667
Yeah, no, that's very crazy.

15:42.668 --> 15:44.468
It does feel good to
do stuff in threes.

15:44.469 --> 15:45.269
Okay, you know what?

15:45.270 --> 15:46.971
I'm pulling the plug on this
whole thing, all right?

15:46.972 --> 15:47.972
'Cause this and this?

15:47.973 --> 15:48.706
This has got to stop.

15:48.707 --> 15:49.373
Yeah you're right.

15:49.374 --> 15:50.875
Tomorrow morning, I'm
getting my mom out of here.

15:50.876 --> 15:51.642
Let's just go to bed.

15:51.643 --> 15:52.944
Yeah, this has not
been a good situation.

15:52.945 --> 15:53.544
Let's go to bed.

15:53.545 --> 15:54.278
This one look off to you?

15:54.279 --> 15:54.779
One, two, three.

15:54.780 --> 15:57.469
No, it's fine. It's fine.

16:01.329 --> 16:03.263
Hey, guys, we got some
bagels and coffee.

16:03.264 --> 16:03.964
One, two, three.

16:03.965 --> 16:05.611
*

16:06.279 --> 16:07.369
There you go.

16:07.756 --> 16:09.585
Oh, mom.

16:09.705 --> 16:11.671
Uh, where's your chewing tobacco?

16:11.672 --> 16:13.507
You know Mrs.
Kelly doesn't like the smoke.

16:13.508 --> 16:16.009
Oh, the ceiling fan is going
to push all the smoke outside

16:16.129 --> 16:16.903
the windows.

16:17.023 --> 16:18.169
Oh, yeah?

16:18.560 --> 16:20.280
Oh, she's fixing the fan?

16:20.281 --> 16:22.449
See? I told you, dude...
my mom is very handy.

16:22.450 --> 16:25.619
Oh. The Muslims are back.

16:25.620 --> 16:28.355
Where do you think they're
coming and going from?

16:28.356 --> 16:29.656
Damn foreigners!

16:29.657 --> 16:32.926
They ain't American, I
don't want to know 'em.

16:32.927 --> 16:33.660
I know.

16:33.661 --> 16:36.129
I wish they'd all go
back to the desert.

16:36.130 --> 16:36.997
Yeah!

16:36.998 --> 16:38.632
So it does seem like
they're bonding, huh?

16:38.633 --> 16:40.700
Yeah. I mean, it's not really
a Golden Girls type

16:40.701 --> 16:43.203
conversation, it's, like, a
racist conversation, but...

16:43.204 --> 16:46.273
Where the hell is my damn screwdriver?

16:46.274 --> 16:48.275
I'm wiping all the germs off for you.

16:48.276 --> 16:51.745
: Quit cleaning my
damn tools and sit your ass

16:51.746 --> 16:53.747
down!

16:53.748 --> 16:56.783
Shit, dude, we might want to
even consider bringing Poppins

16:56.784 --> 16:58.218
back into this mix.

16:58.219 --> 16:59.686
It does seem to be working.

16:59.687 --> 17:00.654
Like it?

17:00.655 --> 17:02.122
Ooh! Yes, I do.

17:02.123 --> 17:03.523
Please don't hit me.

17:03.524 --> 17:04.858
I have sensitive skin.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.060
Let's just find the dog, and
we'll talk about it there.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.060
: Okay, all right.

17:08.061 --> 17:09.619
Let's just let them be, though, huh?

17:13.334 --> 17:15.301
Mm. Mm, mm.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.207
♪ ♪

17:25.479 --> 17:26.946
Good morning, sleepyhead.

17:26.948 --> 17:27.948
What?

17:27.949 --> 17:28.882
Yeah, you're all tied up.

17:28.883 --> 17:29.716
It's for your own safety.

17:29.717 --> 17:31.384
Yeah, you took a dinger
down the stairs.

17:31.385 --> 17:32.152
Ooh, big-time.

17:32.153 --> 17:33.286
You guys untie me right now!

17:33.287 --> 17:35.689
Okay, I'll untie you if you
promise to remember that I took

17:35.690 --> 17:37.638
care of you good.

17:37.758 --> 17:39.059
Yeah, remember that, 'cause
Frank took really good care of

17:39.060 --> 17:41.194
you, so you're gonna have
to take care of him.

17:41.195 --> 17:42.295
What are you talking about?

17:42.296 --> 17:44.865
I feel way worse now than I ever did.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.400
What is going on with my face?!

17:47.401 --> 17:48.168
It's the bedbugs.

17:48.169 --> 17:48.835
Oh!

17:48.836 --> 17:51.838
But that'll last a little while,
but it'll go away eventually.

17:51.839 --> 17:52.906
Get the dog off me!

17:52.907 --> 17:54.774
The dog stinks... get the dog off me!

17:54.775 --> 17:55.575
Fair enough, fair enough.

17:55.576 --> 17:56.376
Poppins, let's go.

17:56.377 --> 17:57.377
Come on, Poppins!

17:57.378 --> 17:58.845
Hop up, Poppins, come on.

17:58.846 --> 17:59.779
Oh, whoa.

17:59.780 --> 18:01.648
Oh, I think Poppins
got into the juice.

18:01.649 --> 18:02.415
What?

18:02.416 --> 18:02.983
Oh, no.

18:02.984 --> 18:03.617
What juice?

18:03.618 --> 18:04.284
Oh. He's ice-cold.

18:04.285 --> 18:05.018
He's dead?

18:05.019 --> 18:06.086
Yes! He's dead!

18:06.087 --> 18:06.953
How is he dead?

18:06.954 --> 18:08.421
Well, why would he be
dead from the juice?

18:08.422 --> 18:09.656
We killed Poppins? Oh, shit!

18:09.657 --> 18:11.558
Oh, my God, Mac's gonna
have a fit, dude.

18:11.559 --> 18:13.760
I drank a lot of that juice...
I remember that very clearly!

18:13.761 --> 18:15.929
I have an idea, Frank, I have an idea.

18:15.930 --> 18:16.897
Fixer's always got a fix, right?

18:16.898 --> 18:18.798
Yeah, what... Oh, this is gonna
work, this is a good idea.

18:18.799 --> 18:19.733
Grab Poppins. Let's go. Come on.

18:19.734 --> 18:20.233
Take the dog?

18:20.234 --> 18:20.734
Grab the dog!

18:20.735 --> 18:21.792
What was in the juice?

18:21.912 --> 18:23.438
Hold on. before you go, untie me.

18:23.489 --> 18:25.453
- Stay right there.
- No, guys!

18:25.573 --> 18:27.407
You guys, I got Groban in the park.

18:27.408 --> 18:28.441
I got a dead dog over here.

18:28.442 --> 18:29.643
I got Groban in the park!

18:29.644 --> 18:30.710
Untie me!

18:31.579 --> 18:33.246
What was in the juice?

18:34.782 --> 18:35.782
One, two, three.

18:35.783 --> 18:36.883
One, two, three.

18:36.884 --> 18:38.885
Charlie, I think you're right,
dude, I feel better about this.

18:38.886 --> 18:39.886
More in control. Yeah.

18:39.887 --> 18:41.221
Yeah, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

18:41.222 --> 18:43.089
Yo, what's happening?

18:43.090 --> 18:44.190
What's happening, guys?

18:44.191 --> 18:46.192
Hey, I was just, uh...
we were hanging out, uh, in the

18:46.193 --> 18:47.260
alley, going for some air.

18:47.261 --> 18:48.295
What's going on?

18:48.296 --> 18:49.095
Yeah.

18:49.096 --> 18:50.163
What are you guys doing?

18:50.164 --> 18:51.865
We're actually looking for Poppins.

18:51.866 --> 18:54.501
Yeah, we're gonna bring him back
over to Charlie's mom's house.

18:54.502 --> 18:55.435
They're gonna live together.

18:55.436 --> 18:56.436
Poppins?

18:56.437 --> 18:57.370
What happened to Poppins?

18:57.371 --> 18:59.506
He w... he, uh...
You saw him.

18:59.507 --> 19:02.309
Yeah, I... might've been...
Why are you guys acting so weird?

19:02.310 --> 19:03.276
Yeah.

19:03.277 --> 19:06.947
Why are... why are you
looking at that trash can?

19:06.948 --> 19:08.915
Uh, nothing special about it.

19:08.916 --> 19:09.849
I don't know.

19:09.850 --> 19:10.984
What was in that trash bag?

19:10.985 --> 19:11.918
Poppins.

19:11.919 --> 19:12.719
What?!

19:12.720 --> 19:14.888
Well, he ate a lot of cold
medicine, and he croaked.

19:14.889 --> 19:17.424
I'm sorry. He-he-he...
Yeah, he got into some cold

19:17.425 --> 19:18.191
medicine. Sorry.

19:18.192 --> 19:19.993
So you threw him in the trash?

19:19.994 --> 19:22.862
Yeah, what are you gonna do,
send him to the moon? Right?

19:22.863 --> 19:24.998
No, I want to have a
proper burial for him.

19:24.999 --> 19:28.268
That seemed proper enough
for Poppins, you know?

19:28.269 --> 19:30.003
Oh, no. He's fine.

19:30.004 --> 19:31.137
What? He's fine?

19:31.138 --> 19:33.606
Yeah, he's just in here
chowing down on a diaper.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.443
Hey! Look at him.

19:36.444 --> 19:40.780
But that dog was...
Come on. Hey, good boy.

19:40.781 --> 19:42.282
That dog just does not die.

19:42.283 --> 19:43.316
No, he does not.

19:43.317 --> 19:44.250
Wow.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.485
Oh, there he goes.

19:45.486 --> 19:47.220
Ah.

19:47.221 --> 19:49.622
Don't worry, guys, he will be back.

19:49.623 --> 19:53.193
Yeah, well... let's hope not.

19:53.194 --> 19:55.195
Bon voyage, Poppins!

19:55.196 --> 19:56.763
Have a good trip.

19:56.764 --> 19:58.398
Back to the bar, or what?

19:58.399 --> 19:59.399
Yeah.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.967
Yeah, sure, let's drink.

20:02.654 --> 20:05.689
Yo, Frank, it's ***. have you seen Dee?

20:05.809 --> 20:08.657
I'm backstage and ***
the party is pumping.

20:08.777 --> 20:11.728
Look, if you see her biatch tell her
to get her ass down here.

20:11.848 --> 20:13.157
Grobin's feeling frisky

20:13.277 --> 20:15.717
and somebody's gotta tap that ass.

20:15.837 --> 20:17.219
Talk to you later.

20:17.339 --> 20:18.823
No, no...

20:18.943 --> 20:20.494
Grobin!!!

20:20.614 --> 20:22.604
