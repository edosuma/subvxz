WEBVTT

00:02.700 --> 00:05.000
This is Nome, Alaska,

00:05.033 --> 00:07.600
home to the biggest
offshore gold deposit

00:07.634 --> 00:08.967
in the world.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.333
The worst winter
in a hundred years

00:11.367 --> 00:13.100
has left the miners
little time

00:13.133 --> 00:14.567
to get under the ice.

00:16.333 --> 00:18.500
But now, a sudden break
in the weather

00:18.533 --> 00:22.767
is providing the season's
first golden opportunity

00:22.800 --> 00:24.834
and the fleet is ready
to take advantage.

00:26.266 --> 00:27.500
Just look at them go.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.100
But the question is

00:31.133 --> 00:32.767
who will make the most of it?

00:33.734 --> 00:35.900
Miners, get on that seafloor

00:35.934 --> 00:37.934
and do what
you came here to do.

00:39.667 --> 00:40.400
On your mark,

00:41.567 --> 00:42.567
get set,

00:43.100 --> 00:43.867
go.

01:08.867 --> 01:11.000
After yesterday's
show,

01:12.300 --> 01:15.467
it's, uh, important for me
to be getting out here

01:15.500 --> 01:17.200
before Zeke
every single morning,

01:18.033 --> 01:19.100
prep everything

01:19.767 --> 01:22.166
so that our operation

01:22.200 --> 01:24.467
is substantially smoother
than that.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.400
After yesterday's fiasco...

01:31.433 --> 01:33.200
Somebody should've
noticed

01:33.233 --> 01:35.667
that the generators
were in a puddle

01:35.700 --> 01:37.600
like, seriously,
that's, like, the only thing

01:37.634 --> 01:39.667
that's actually
really important.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.834
Gabe Tenhoff
gets an early start,

01:41.867 --> 01:44.700
trying to prevent
any more snafus.

01:49.734 --> 01:50.800
Hey.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.033
How you feeling?

01:53.967 --> 01:55.033
Great.

01:55.066 --> 01:56.500
Got any lunch?

01:56.533 --> 01:59.133
Oh, I thought you'd have
some hotdogs on the...

01:59.166 --> 02:01.533
On the stove by now.

02:01.567 --> 02:04.834
Yeah? Well, I thought
I would have some help

02:04.867 --> 02:06.133
getting ready.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.834
Getting something to eat.

02:10.867 --> 02:13.834
The loss of that generator
was mostly on Gabe,

02:13.867 --> 02:16.600
kind of a little bit on me
because I was up there, too.

02:16.634 --> 02:18.467
But it's mostly on Gabe.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.934
This operation
is kind of a mess so far.

02:20.967 --> 02:23.867
No gold, therefore,
no money for me.

02:23.900 --> 02:25.500
This isn't a charity mission.

02:25.533 --> 02:27.433
Man, I'm getting
a little antsy.

02:29.266 --> 02:30.667
There's a lot to do
every morning

02:30.700 --> 02:32.767
to get this operation
fired up.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.500
Sometimes when it's freezing out,

02:34.533 --> 02:36.233
it's, kind of, difficult
to get motivated.

02:36.266 --> 02:38.333
The air hurts your face.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.066
You question
your life decisions.

02:42.166 --> 02:45.033
You feel palpable regret
for not going to college.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.033
Then you bury
all those emotions down

02:48.066 --> 02:49.467
as deep as you possibly can

02:49.500 --> 02:51.333
and you go along
with your day.

02:51.367 --> 02:52.667
Come on, you

02:53.367 --> 02:54.500
Yes!

02:56.066 --> 02:57.467
We got hot water.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.400
We want everything
running smooth.

02:59.433 --> 03:02.000
Just going.
By the time the Zeke goes up,

03:02.033 --> 03:03.266
he can just slap on a wetsuit

03:03.300 --> 03:04.233
and get right under
the water.

03:08.567 --> 03:09.967
All right.

03:10.000 --> 03:10.734
We're running.

03:11.934 --> 03:13.433
Dude, I appreciate it so much,

03:13.467 --> 03:15.934
you guys getting everything
running for me.

03:15.967 --> 03:17.634
I mean, it's just
wonderful to have people

03:17.667 --> 03:19.767
that can get things going
for me.

03:21.567 --> 03:24.100
Yesterday was just
a complete cluster.

03:24.133 --> 03:25.400
I need at least 8 ounces

03:25.433 --> 03:27.467
just to keep my operation
going for the summer

03:27.500 --> 03:29.700
and right now we don't have
any gold at all.

03:29.734 --> 03:33.367
Nothing.
It's completely unacceptable.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.100
Okay, there we go.
Grab that pressure line.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.200
The guys are giving it all
they got

03:38.233 --> 03:39.500
and we finally have
good weather.

03:39.533 --> 03:41.367
This is what
I've been waiting for.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.700
I'm gonna do something
that I really hope

03:42.734 --> 03:43.967
turns things around.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.967
I'm gonna go
on a marathon dive.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.266
This is something I can do

03:47.300 --> 03:48.867
that's totally
under my control

03:48.900 --> 03:50.634
that can get us back on track.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.133
So I'm gonna suit up.

03:52.867 --> 03:54.800
There's like a pile of rocks,

03:54.834 --> 03:56.400
pretty dense cobbles.

03:56.433 --> 03:58.967
It's pretty much kind of right
under where the dive hole is.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.033
There's gold coming out of it.

04:01.066 --> 04:02.900
So, I just wanna keep...

04:02.934 --> 04:05.300
Just try to see if I can plow
through that pile of rocks.

04:07.467 --> 04:08.800
I'm gonna reach down deep

04:08.834 --> 04:10.233
and try to pull out
something extra.

04:10.266 --> 04:11.467
If I don't do it now,

04:11.500 --> 04:12.600
I don't know
if we're gonna be

04:12.634 --> 04:14.066
able to keep
the operation going.

04:15.333 --> 04:16.367
How's your air flow?

04:20.934 --> 04:22.734
It's time for us
to get some gold.

04:37.567 --> 04:40.133
Harrowing day yesterday.

04:40.166 --> 04:44.066
It's still dark and it's still
dangerous down there.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.533
So how's all
the systems feeling?

04:50.567 --> 04:51.567
Everything good?

05:02.200 --> 05:03.467
All right.

05:06.066 --> 05:09.467
To painted sluice boxes
and maintenance-free guys.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.000
Sun's shining,

05:13.033 --> 05:14.900
we're gonna get six hours
on the box.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.400
2 miles east...

05:20.367 --> 05:22.967
All right, Gary,
how are you feeling?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I'm feeling plenty good enough
to get down there

05:25.033 --> 05:26.767
- and get some gold.
- All right.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.967
I mean, this is what you call
a stellar day in Nome.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.333
It doesn't get much better
than this.

05:32.367 --> 05:36.066
By the end of the day,
we'll have gold in the box.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.400
Vernon's making the most

05:37.433 --> 05:38.667
of the break in the weather

05:38.700 --> 05:41.433
by unleashing
his secret weapon.

05:41.467 --> 05:42.400
- Yeah.
- Let's get her done.

05:42.433 --> 05:43.533
I'll go and get dressed.

05:43.567 --> 05:44.533
All right.

05:45.533 --> 05:47.700
We're on super gold here on 56

05:47.734 --> 05:51.200
and that's why I'm aiming
for 200 ounces this season.

05:51.233 --> 05:52.600
That'll be a record for me

05:52.634 --> 05:55.000
and that ain't pie in the sky

05:55.033 --> 05:57.300
and I've got a plan
to pull it off.

06:00.500 --> 06:04.033
I've got two A-list divers,
Gary and Gary.

06:04.066 --> 06:07.834
And today, I'll be able
to send both of them down.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.600
We're talking about a twofer,
a two-headed monster,

06:10.634 --> 06:13.033
whatever you wanna call it,
we're got to get down there

06:13.066 --> 06:14.166
and milk those hours

06:14.200 --> 06:16.266
until we can't
milk them anymore.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.166
All right, Gary.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.300
Be careful down there.

06:43.133 --> 06:44.800
Yes, we feel good down here.

06:45.567 --> 06:46.567
All right.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.567
All right.
Let's get busy.

06:59.300 --> 07:02.133
Seeing little pieces
of gold right now.

07:02.166 --> 07:03.700
Look at that.
Right off the bat.

07:03.734 --> 07:05.033
He's already seeing gold.

07:05.066 --> 07:06.600
That's what I'm talking about
right there.

07:06.634 --> 07:07.433
Woo!

07:07.467 --> 07:09.100
Ah, yeah.

07:09.133 --> 07:11.000
All right, Gary.

07:11.033 --> 07:13.000
He's just happy as a lark.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.634
Oh. Woo!

07:15.133 --> 07:16.800
The guy's orgasmic.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.133
Woo.

07:19.166 --> 07:20.634
My goodness

07:20.667 --> 07:21.834
Come on, baby.

07:22.533 --> 07:25.166
- Ah, I love it.

07:26.066 --> 07:27.300
Ah.

07:27.333 --> 07:28.967
I see gold coming
out of this

07:30.800 --> 07:32.300
That's some good sections.

07:32.734 --> 07:34.200
Yeah.

07:34.233 --> 07:35.333
Before it's over with,

07:35.367 --> 07:37.266
Gary will go down there
and suck it up.

07:37.300 --> 07:39.367
And then hopefully,
we'll be doing this

07:39.400 --> 07:40.800
for the rest of the season.

07:40.834 --> 07:42.767
Look at it all man.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.333
10 miles west...

07:52.266 --> 07:54.500
Headed back out
to the Tomcod.

07:54.533 --> 07:57.533
This has been probably
the worst weather we've had

07:57.567 --> 07:59.967
for ice mining ever.

08:00.066 --> 08:01.800
The window of calm weather

08:01.834 --> 08:03.700
has given Shawn Pomrenke

08:03.734 --> 08:07.700
a clean shot to track down
his golden jackpot.

08:07.734 --> 08:09.834
It's been
one nightmare after another

08:09.867 --> 08:11.734
out here this year.

08:11.767 --> 08:14.233
But at least the sun's up.

08:14.266 --> 08:16.834
The Bering Sea doesn't give
you a lot of opportunities.

08:16.867 --> 08:18.734
So when it does,
you got to run with it.

08:18.767 --> 08:20.700
I'm on the cusp
of something great,

08:20.734 --> 08:24.066
a huge pocket of gold,
a massive pile of gold.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.533
So, I'm gonna use
a few new toys to stay down

08:26.567 --> 08:29.500
as long as I can
to get on this sucker.

08:29.533 --> 08:32.600
Last time we were out here,
the compressor was acting up,

08:32.634 --> 08:34.634
giving us a hard time,

08:35.567 --> 08:37.100
so I got a new one.

08:37.634 --> 08:38.967
It's electric,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.100
actually,
I picked up an extension

08:41.133 --> 08:43.233
through the hose, too.

08:43.266 --> 08:45.734
That'll keep us from having
a move so much.

08:46.367 --> 08:47.934
We're gonna give it a try.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.567
I got serious payments
coming up.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.300
I got the Tomcod,
the revamp of the Myrtle,

08:53.333 --> 08:54.834
and the inland mine.

08:54.867 --> 08:57.867
I'm gonna need probably
120 ounces to cover it all.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.667
So far, I'm on a good pace,

08:59.700 --> 09:01.867
but I still got
80 ounces to go.

09:01.900 --> 09:03.400
I gotta push it today.

09:05.033 --> 09:07.667
Get in the water,
start diving.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.133
We having fun yet?

09:17.367 --> 09:19.400
How's she looking?

09:19.433 --> 09:22.166
I see you brought that
air compressor out today, huh?

09:22.200 --> 09:23.667
Yeah,
I got the air compressors

09:23.700 --> 09:26.433
on the tractor trailer
in the box there.

09:28.166 --> 09:29.800
Oh, yeah.

09:29.834 --> 09:31.767
Plug it in, and try it out.

09:33.066 --> 09:34.700
Hopefully, this new
air compressor

09:34.734 --> 09:36.166
and the hose extension

09:36.200 --> 09:38.100
allows me to stay down there
long enough

09:38.133 --> 09:40.233
to map out this entire area.

09:41.367 --> 09:43.767
Looks like this pay streak's
headed north.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.433
Gold lives with the heavies,

09:45.467 --> 09:47.166
so seeing a higher
concentration

09:47.200 --> 09:50.500
of the black sands,
magnetite, and iron

09:50.533 --> 09:52.133
means we're on
the right trail.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.000
It seems to be working.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.133
Wanna let the air compressor
run a little bit.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.000
Get suited up.
Get in the water.

10:06.100 --> 10:09.800
Oh, we got hot water going,
air compressor's good,

10:09.834 --> 10:12.567
we got water running
in the sluice box.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.533
Only thing now is for me
to get down there

10:14.567 --> 10:16.100
and suck up some gold.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.700
This is the best part
of the job.

10:27.467 --> 10:29.533
All righty, bruh.
Get that gold.

10:55.934 --> 10:57.867
It looks like the float bags
are working all right.

10:59.066 --> 11:02.333
Before the hose went just
straight up and down like this

11:02.367 --> 11:03.867
up to the sluice box,

11:03.900 --> 11:05.467
I threw some float bags on it,

11:05.500 --> 11:08.100
right near the bottom
and about halfway up,

11:08.133 --> 11:09.634
stretches out the hose,
gives the gold

11:09.667 --> 11:11.300
somewhere to lie down
before it hits the box,

11:11.333 --> 11:13.533
instead of swirling up
the hose into the box.

11:14.667 --> 11:16.133
How's that compressor?

11:21.634 --> 11:23.100
Ten-four.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.033
Hell yeah.

11:43.066 --> 11:44.000
We're finding the heavies.

11:44.033 --> 11:45.567
And now we just got to find
the gold.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.233
Okay. Team meeting, everybody.

12:22.567 --> 12:25.166
Get a plan, quick two-minute
group meeting,

12:25.200 --> 12:27.100
and then we all go
get back to work.

12:27.133 --> 12:29.634
After days
of storms and breakdowns,

12:29.667 --> 12:33.767
Kris Kelly has exactly zero
ounces of gold to his name.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.000
But with perfect
mining weather,

12:36.033 --> 12:38.567
it's time to join
the marathon dive parade,

12:38.600 --> 12:40.333
by any means necessary.

12:40.367 --> 12:42.233
The plan today is get gold.

12:42.266 --> 12:43.367
We got a hose extension,

12:43.400 --> 12:45.266
we're gonna add
another 25 feet.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.133
We're gonna get down there
and we're gonna see

12:47.166 --> 12:50.600
if there's anything underneath
that huge overburden.

12:50.634 --> 12:52.266
Okay. Well, everybody knows
their job.

12:52.300 --> 12:53.467
- Come on. Let's do it.
- There you go.

12:54.667 --> 12:56.800
So far, this winter's
been a disaster.

12:56.834 --> 12:58.533
I got top of the line
equipment,

12:58.567 --> 13:01.467
I really went for it
and it wasn't cheap.

13:01.500 --> 13:04.066
After everything,
I just need 25 ounces

13:04.100 --> 13:06.033
to make this winter
a success.

13:06.066 --> 13:08.500
So far, I have nothing.

13:11.900 --> 13:13.934
My dad broke off
so much of the hose

13:13.967 --> 13:15.734
I couldn't even reach
the gold

13:15.767 --> 13:17.333
when I went diving last time.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.266
But today, I've got a plan

13:20.300 --> 13:22.433
that should get us back
on track.

13:22.467 --> 13:24.767
And with clear weather,
I'm gonna mine my ass off.

13:25.934 --> 13:28.200
Today, we're putting a hose
extension on the water.

13:28.233 --> 13:29.700
We're getting everything
up and running

13:29.734 --> 13:31.000
and I'm jumping in the water

13:31.033 --> 13:32.533
and we're gonna
find out exactly

13:32.567 --> 13:34.300
what's underneath my feet.

13:35.734 --> 13:37.834
We're gonna plug
to the bottom of the hose

13:37.867 --> 13:41.133
into the jet log and throw
the whole hose in the water.

13:41.166 --> 13:42.200
Okay. Let's go.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.133
Now, we have one
70-foot hose.

13:48.166 --> 13:50.367
We're actually ready
to go right now.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.967
Start them both.

13:56.233 --> 13:57.433
We got it.

14:00.667 --> 14:03.867
So look, I'm extra
stressed about the situation.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.567
Not only can we go broke,

14:05.600 --> 14:07.634
but I'm about to be
a new father.

14:07.667 --> 14:09.767
I'm about to have
a little Kelly of my own.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.533
I'll have a family
of my own

14:14.567 --> 14:16.100
that I'll have
to take care of.

14:16.133 --> 14:18.033
So right now, my success
or failure

14:18.066 --> 14:20.367
is taking on
huge consequences.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.834
Okay. Let's do it.

14:22.767 --> 14:24.100
Hook him up, bae.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.400
Okay. Let's go.
Go get them.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.266
Okay. Let's see
what we got going on here.

14:41.867 --> 14:44.200
You got 125 pounds
of air pressure, okay?

14:44.233 --> 14:46.367
Everything's good.

14:46.400 --> 14:50.200
Kenny, we are lucky the hose
coiled itself perfectly.

14:53.233 --> 14:55.767
Yup, I got lucky.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.634
Then, maybe everything's
gonna go good from now on.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.834
Well, it should.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.400
Just pick a spot
and start working it

15:03.433 --> 15:06.533
and get it about 5 feet wide
and see how deep it goes.

15:06.567 --> 15:07.667
Okay.

15:13.333 --> 15:14.867
That's all she's got.

15:14.900 --> 15:16.433
They're rippin' suction.

15:19.867 --> 15:21.634
How's the material looking?

15:21.667 --> 15:23.767
Uh, it's good,
I found a spot.

15:30.600 --> 15:31.734
We get clay.

15:34.133 --> 15:35.567
That might be gold.

15:37.634 --> 15:39.166
Gold.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.200
He found gold.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.500
Don't say that
unless you're for sure.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.400
I don't know for sure.

15:47.433 --> 15:49.100
I can't really tell.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.767
What I'm looking for
is little itty-bitty

15:52.800 --> 15:56.000
flakes of gold
sliding across the clay.

15:56.033 --> 15:57.600
There's gotta be gold
under there.

15:59.634 --> 16:02.667
Just keep working,
that's all that matters.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.000
We need that gold
to pay off the equipment.

16:05.033 --> 16:06.133
I know.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.066
I'm not leaving without gold.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.367
1 mile west...

16:14.634 --> 16:16.333
Seeing some good stuff
down there?

16:31.834 --> 16:33.600
Hell yeah.

16:33.634 --> 16:36.233
With added
time and added reach,

16:36.266 --> 16:38.567
Mr. Gold is making the most

16:38.600 --> 16:41.200
of the season's
first storm-free day.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.233
All right.
Do you want me to pass

16:53.266 --> 16:54.600
that extension down to you?

17:01.900 --> 17:04.200
All right. I'll, uh,
wrestle it over to the hole

17:04.233 --> 17:05.634
and pass it down to you.

17:05.667 --> 17:07.467
How is that compressor
keeping up?

17:19.467 --> 17:21.033
I'll take a look at it.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.734
Dude
always makes me nervous.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.767
So I guess
he's still breathing.

18:03.233 --> 18:04.467
Oh, yeah.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.300
This will give him
20 more foot of reach

18:06.333 --> 18:07.667
to go out and poke through it.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.300
Sounds like he's anticipating
finding something

18:22.333 --> 18:23.600
pretty good out in front.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.567
Oh, oh, oh.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.033
Hell yeah.
Which direction are you in?

18:43.166 --> 18:45.900
Well, that matches right up
with our suspicions.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.700
Burning gas, hauling ass.

18:58.233 --> 19:00.867
Yeah.

19:00.900 --> 19:04.667
Let me have a double shot
of red eye in a dirty glass.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.533
I thought I'd drop in there

19:06.567 --> 19:08.800
and I'll get
the juices flowing

19:08.834 --> 19:12.767
and catch up on social media.

19:14.367 --> 19:15.367
Delicious.

19:16.433 --> 19:18.000
And now, another episode

19:18.033 --> 19:20.133
of Social Hour with Vernon.

19:21.867 --> 19:23.166
Oh, let's see.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.500
In Dust We Trust,

19:25.533 --> 19:27.667
"I wanna be like Vernon
when I get older,

19:27.700 --> 19:30.500
drunk angry
and giving zero [bleep]."

19:31.367 --> 19:32.934
I don't know about all that.

19:32.967 --> 19:34.634
You haven't really
seen me drunk

19:34.667 --> 19:36.567
and you don't wanna
see me drunk.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.967
Give me a shot
of that Jamesons.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.367
This is spiritual.

19:43.033 --> 19:45.900
That goes down
pretty damn smooth.

19:45.934 --> 19:49.533
Next batter up,
from Harmless Potato,

19:49.567 --> 19:53.066
"Vernon, I saw an episode
where you were eating

19:53.100 --> 19:55.700
what looked like
a burnt log."

19:55.734 --> 19:57.200
What was it?

19:57.233 --> 20:00.266
You know,
I have no memory of that.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.867
That thing's burnt
to
but I bet it's good.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.033
I deny eating
any burnt logs or anything

20:10.066 --> 20:11.700
that looked like a burnt log.

20:11.734 --> 20:14.533
They don't make them like this
in the restaurant.

20:14.567 --> 20:15.967
I've eaten a lot of things

20:16.000 --> 20:17.867
that I didn't remember
the next day but...

20:17.900 --> 20:19.300
For the life of me.

20:20.033 --> 20:21.433
I don't remember that one.

20:22.166 --> 20:23.700
All right, potato.

20:23.734 --> 20:27.533
Nice hearing from you.
Angel, thanks for the drink.

20:27.567 --> 20:29.066
This has been another episode

20:29.100 --> 20:31.300
of Social Hour with Vernon.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.533
In Nome,

20:35.867 --> 20:38.467
it's the first calm weather
window of the season.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.433
And every member of the fleet

20:42.467 --> 20:44.266
is pushing to make
the most of it.

20:52.266 --> 20:54.700
Hey, so right now,
everything is running good.

20:54.734 --> 20:56.100
How are you feeling?

20:57.166 --> 20:58.700
I think everything's
going great.

20:58.734 --> 21:01.600
Little pieces of gold
are flying through this hose

21:01.634 --> 21:03.200
and into the sluice box.

21:03.233 --> 21:06.467
I'm gonna pound it out
so hard you don't even know.

21:06.500 --> 21:07.934
If I put in a lot of hours,

21:07.967 --> 21:09.734
it will, like,
the math will work out.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.200
So far this winter,

21:12.233 --> 21:14.734
Zeke has yet to clean
an ounce of gold.

21:14.767 --> 21:17.900
But thanks to today's
favorable conditions,

21:17.934 --> 21:19.767
he's managed to put
in three hours

21:19.800 --> 21:21.333
toward changing his fortune.

21:25.767 --> 21:27.667
Yeah.
It's like this reef of rocks.

21:28.834 --> 21:30.967
Yeah, there's some gold here.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.333
I mean, definitely gold
in the area and...

21:46.734 --> 21:49.133
All right. Roger.

21:49.166 --> 21:51.400
Chipping his way through
a big dense rock pile

21:51.433 --> 21:53.533
that's right at the bottom
of the ice hole.

21:53.567 --> 21:59.166
The ice hole right here,
like this hose is coming down,

22:00.400 --> 22:02.800
like that and then there's
this big mound of rocks

22:04.066 --> 22:05.200
going right there.

22:05.233 --> 22:06.800
And it's very dense.

22:06.834 --> 22:09.133
It's usually really hard
to chip your way through.

22:09.166 --> 22:10.734
That's what he's working
through right now.

22:13.967 --> 22:16.033
I got a lot
of work to do.

22:16.066 --> 22:20.066
I wanna dive over
just stupid amount of hours.

22:20.100 --> 22:23.400
Time to get serious.

22:23.433 --> 22:25.066
Well, dude, I like that plan.

22:25.100 --> 22:26.066
It's a good plan.

22:27.233 --> 22:28.367
It's a dive boat.

22:29.834 --> 22:32.600
Putting gold in the sluice
box and listening to motors.

22:33.967 --> 22:35.166
It's tranquil.

22:35.800 --> 22:36.867
Dialed in.

22:36.900 --> 22:37.867
I love it.

22:38.967 --> 22:40.300
2 miles east...

22:48.967 --> 22:51.967
Yeah. Hey, Gary, it's going
good in the direction

22:52.000 --> 22:54.400
you're stretched out in,
right?

22:54.433 --> 22:56.400
Yeah.
I can see pieces of gold

22:56.433 --> 22:58.266
just falling out on the dirt.

22:58.300 --> 22:59.300
I mean everywhere.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.166
Well, yippee-ki-yay.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.166
That's what I like
to hear, Gary.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.033
You're my favorite nozzleman.

23:07.433 --> 23:09.300
Vernon Adkison's
turning today's

23:09.333 --> 23:12.200
golden sunshine
into gold in the box

23:12.233 --> 23:14.233
as he finishes off
the first round

23:14.266 --> 23:16.166
of his mining doubleheader.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.834
It was a long time coming

23:17.867 --> 23:20.033
but it seems like
we've got everything working

23:20.066 --> 23:21.400
just the way it's supposed to.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.734
Okay, Gary,
you got your time in.

23:25.767 --> 23:28.467
That's four hours
and that's it.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.800
The other Gary,
I wanna send old Gary out.

23:30.834 --> 23:32.033
Come on up.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.433
Roger that, Vernon.

23:34.467 --> 23:35.200
I'm on my way.

23:36.634 --> 23:38.667
That was in
good dive. Good dive.

23:44.667 --> 23:47.100
Gary's just finished up
his shot.

23:47.133 --> 23:49.433
He was moving a hell
of a lot of material.

23:50.567 --> 23:56.934
And, uh, Gary Panos,
old Gary, same deal.

23:56.967 --> 24:00.333
Gary's got to get him
and hammer it, yet once again.

24:01.567 --> 24:04.000
I think I've got a pretty
good damn team right now.

24:09.166 --> 24:12.367
This will be Gary Panos's
first dive for the season.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.734
He's one of the best divers
I've ever had.

24:14.767 --> 24:18.066
So it's gonna be come
to gold daddy time

24:18.100 --> 24:19.967
and, uh, we're gonna crush it.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.133
All right.

24:31.934 --> 24:34.166
You got about
80 psi, it's coming up.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.500
All right. Copy that.

24:46.667 --> 24:48.900
Yeah, okay. Well, that's good
you seeing gold.

24:50.433 --> 24:51.934
Yee-haw.

24:52.533 --> 24:53.934
Yee-haw.

24:56.967 --> 24:58.166
That's good.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.200
Because now, he's starting
to get the spirit.

25:03.233 --> 25:05.133
I'm gonna have a hard time
pulling him up.

25:06.967 --> 25:08.166
This looks great.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.667
All right. All right.

25:10.367 --> 25:11.533
10 miles west...

25:15.967 --> 25:17.634
pictures of cobble.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.867
We get clay
two and a half feet.

25:22.667 --> 25:25.400
- Get any gold there?
- Yeah. Any gold on it?

25:25.433 --> 25:27.166
Hold on.
Just give me a second.

25:29.834 --> 25:32.166
Oh, we're definitely on gold.

25:32.200 --> 25:35.000
After hours
of scouring the seafloor,

25:35.033 --> 25:38.600
Kris Kelly, may finally be
digging out of debt.

25:39.867 --> 25:41.600
How much?

25:41.634 --> 25:43.333
I can't really see
how much gold

25:43.367 --> 25:45.333
I'm on right now but I...

25:45.367 --> 25:46.667
I'm killing it.

25:49.400 --> 25:52.667
Oh, you know what?

26:09.166 --> 26:11.367
So, we got a gold
painted nozzle.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.667
So that could be
the paint chipping off

26:13.700 --> 26:15.934
and Kris is sucking that up
and seeing that.

26:17.133 --> 26:18.400
Let's do a test.

26:21.934 --> 26:24.166
See the black you
don't see any gold, right?

26:30.533 --> 26:32.333
That's paint on the rock.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.133
I think the powder coating
of the nozzle

26:36.166 --> 26:37.867
is definitely coming off.

26:48.033 --> 26:49.300
I say we move.

26:55.700 --> 26:59.867
Well, I'm telling you
the nozzle is gold.

27:00.834 --> 27:02.333
Kris's guide to mining.

27:02.367 --> 27:04.300
First of all,
you better be able to tell

27:04.333 --> 27:06.133
the different gold and paint.

27:08.400 --> 27:10.266
I think
we should move out of here.

27:10.300 --> 27:12.233
I don't like this.

27:12.266 --> 27:14.967
Okay, Kris, we got
five hours, come on up.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.734
Okay. I'm coming.

27:16.767 --> 27:18.400
What a waste of time.

27:23.367 --> 27:25.934
The nozzle's
powder coated in gold.

27:25.967 --> 27:27.600
- So like...
- Think the hot water line

27:27.634 --> 27:28.934
...when I was dragging
the nozzle

27:28.967 --> 27:30.800
and moving it around,
you can see that gold

27:30.834 --> 27:32.200
from the nozzle.

27:32.233 --> 27:34.500
It was just
gold-colored paint.

27:36.266 --> 27:37.600
So right now, I'm pissed.

27:37.634 --> 27:39.467
I've been on gold,
what I thought was gold,

27:39.500 --> 27:40.800
and it turns out to be paint.

27:40.834 --> 27:42.133
Am I a idiot?

27:42.166 --> 27:44.033
I can't have this
happen right now.

27:44.066 --> 27:45.433
We need to get gold.

27:45.467 --> 27:47.200
Sucking up paint chips, man?

27:47.233 --> 27:49.300
That's that weird kid
at school.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.333
I hope that's not
gonna be my kid.

27:51.367 --> 27:53.934
So bottom line,
this spot sucks.

27:53.967 --> 27:57.600
We've got no gold
and we're running out of time.

27:57.634 --> 28:01.166
Holy there's a pile
of sand underneath us.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.200
It feels like
I'm on the beach.

28:03.233 --> 28:05.033
So what's the plan
for tomorrow, Captain?

28:05.600 --> 28:06.834
Plan for tomorrow,

28:06.867 --> 28:08.867
we're gonna move west
one more.

28:09.634 --> 28:11.433
I just hope to God
there's gold.

28:11.467 --> 28:12.634
There better be.

28:13.100 --> 28:14.000
Let's go.

28:16.834 --> 28:18.400
Nothing worked for me today.

28:18.433 --> 28:20.200
Everything's going
to

28:36.133 --> 28:37.033
Oh, good.

28:41.033 --> 28:42.967
Stretched out
farther from the dive hole

28:43.000 --> 28:44.467
that he's been all season,

28:44.500 --> 28:47.433
Shawn Pomrenke is sneaking
to the front of the pack

28:47.467 --> 28:49.200
in today's marathon dive.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.800
So you've about eaten up
all the ground,

29:08.834 --> 29:10.734
you can reach
with that extension?

29:44.867 --> 29:46.667
- That was a good dive.
Hell yeah.

29:46.700 --> 29:47.800
I love it.

29:47.834 --> 29:49.767
The box is looking good.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.967
- Box is looking good.
- Mmm-hmm.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.734
Compresser worked, hot water,

29:53.767 --> 29:56.300
heaters working,
pumps running.

29:56.333 --> 29:57.700
Hell, life's good.

29:57.734 --> 29:58.767
Hey. Hell yeah.

30:00.567 --> 30:02.166
It was a killer day today.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.000
It was just what I needed.

30:04.033 --> 30:05.600
We got lots of hours
in the box

30:05.634 --> 30:07.567
and I got to follow
the pay streak

30:07.600 --> 30:10.266
out away from the hole
and it's loaded out there.

30:10.300 --> 30:11.600
I'm on it.

30:11.634 --> 30:13.000
There's no stopping us now.

30:13.033 --> 30:14.667
I got out as far as I could.

30:14.700 --> 30:18.066
We see a good gold so Joe
threw down the extension,

30:18.100 --> 30:20.300
we hooked it up,
got out to the end,

30:20.333 --> 30:21.400
it was well worth it.

30:22.100 --> 30:24.266
But I've had a long day.

30:24.867 --> 30:26.066
It's cold out here.

30:26.100 --> 30:27.233
I'm ready to go home.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.867
We're back in business.

30:39.433 --> 30:40.834
8 miles east...

30:49.767 --> 30:50.934
Yeah. I'm out of shape.

30:50.967 --> 30:52.567
My arms need to get stronger.

30:54.166 --> 30:55.266
You okay?

30:55.300 --> 30:56.200
Yeah.

30:57.667 --> 31:00.200
I think
it's time to call it a day.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.934
I think I'm gonna come on up.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.033
Yeah, you got us there, man.

31:06.066 --> 31:06.800
I'm stoked.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.033
After a season
of dives cut short,

31:10.066 --> 31:13.767
Zeke Tenhoff notches
seven long hours on the box.

31:23.767 --> 31:24.834
That was smooth.

31:24.867 --> 31:25.967
Maintenance-free.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.667
Yeah. It was a good,
solid dive.

31:28.700 --> 31:30.000
It was a nice long one.

31:30.033 --> 31:31.333
I was in the zone.

31:31.367 --> 31:34.200
We just need to have
a lot more of those.

31:34.233 --> 31:35.867
Oh, we're gonna have
another one of them tomorrow.

31:35.900 --> 31:37.100
Yeah? Do it.

31:38.100 --> 31:39.800
This season
has been super rough

31:39.834 --> 31:41.634
with all these blizzards
that we've been getting

31:41.667 --> 31:43.734
and all the problems
that are attached to that

31:43.767 --> 31:46.033
but today, I was able to do
what I set out to do,

31:46.066 --> 31:48.700
which was put out tons
of hours on the box

31:48.734 --> 31:50.467
and I've definitely
got some gold.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.500
We needed this bad.

32:03.700 --> 32:05.100
2 miles east...

32:05.967 --> 32:07.867
That was chunky
right there.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.266
See this little area
right here?

32:11.300 --> 32:13.166
The whole piece's coming out.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.100
That one's about
four or five pieces
under that one little.

32:15.133 --> 32:16.200
There's another one.

32:17.467 --> 32:20.166
Oh, yeah. And another.
And another.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.867
Right there's a piece.
Another piece.

32:21.900 --> 32:24.000
Another piece
lodged right there.

32:24.033 --> 32:25.900
Yeah. That's a little puddle.

32:25.934 --> 32:27.233
It looks good.

32:29.967 --> 32:31.300
All right, Gary.

32:32.834 --> 32:34.667
Vernon Adkison's double dive

32:34.700 --> 32:36.900
has outlasted any team
in the fleet

32:36.934 --> 32:39.367
as his two star divers
clock in

32:39.400 --> 32:42.100
over eight hours
of dredging duty.

32:42.133 --> 32:43.934
We're gonna go ahead
and call it.

32:45.166 --> 32:46.700
We're good.

32:46.734 --> 32:48.967
Why don't you come on out
and we'll put it to bed

32:49.000 --> 32:50.700
And hit it
first thing in the morning?

32:51.467 --> 32:52.934
Yeah, we have a copy.

33:00.700 --> 33:04.066
The doubleheader dive was
twice as nice as I expected.

33:04.100 --> 33:05.033
We cleaned up.

33:05.066 --> 33:06.133
We've mopped it up.

33:07.767 --> 33:09.367
Well, that was
a damn good day.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.634
I know damn well there's
a good gold in that box.

33:12.533 --> 33:14.166
World's super gold.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.934
I think this clean-out's
gonna make me

33:15.967 --> 33:18.166
light up
like a Christmas tree.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.567
That 200 ounce gold
is in sight.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.066
We got enough time
to measure with a bang.

33:36.667 --> 33:38.200
I'm already tired
and I'm hungry

33:38.233 --> 33:39.400
and I'm ready for dinner.

33:40.400 --> 33:41.834
Why not have a barbecue?

33:45.700 --> 33:48.233
Yeah. It's
Einstein right there.

33:48.266 --> 33:49.667
- Let's go.
you gonna wait?

33:49.700 --> 33:51.900
It's probably not
the brightest thing, uh,

33:51.934 --> 33:54.400
to barbecue on top
of the sluice box

33:54.433 --> 33:56.300
when you got all the grease
from the meats

33:56.333 --> 33:58.200
just dripping down
and start dropping

33:58.233 --> 33:59.900
into the sluice box
and it's gonna be

33:59.934 --> 34:01.533
a little dead spot
where it's just

34:01.567 --> 34:02.567
gonna pull his gold away.

34:02.600 --> 34:03.900
Yeah. I know.

34:03.934 --> 34:05.100
Oh, man, there's a lot.

34:05.133 --> 34:06.767
That's a burn victim
right there.

34:07.433 --> 34:08.233
Oh, well.

34:08.700 --> 34:09.834
Hot dog was good.

34:09.867 --> 34:11.033
You don't want a bun?

34:11.066 --> 34:12.300
No, I'm good.

34:12.333 --> 34:14.066
Straight up savages
around here.

34:14.100 --> 34:17.200
When you see a grill
on top of your sluice box,

34:17.233 --> 34:18.934
you know this is a failure.

34:18.967 --> 34:20.900
The barbecue
is going all right.

34:22.233 --> 34:26.333
There's no mining
whatsoever is gonna be done?

34:26.367 --> 34:28.367
Do they really know what
the they're doing?

34:28.400 --> 34:29.800
Did you eat enough hotdogs?

34:33.533 --> 34:34.634
That's a yes.

34:35.700 --> 34:37.000
I personally think

34:37.033 --> 34:38.767
it's the best part
of working for us.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.100
First clean-out
of the ice season.

34:50.133 --> 34:52.433
Oh, I don't have any idea
how much it's gonna be.

34:52.467 --> 34:54.734
After pushing
for seven grueling hours,

34:54.767 --> 34:57.200
Zeke Tenhoff
is about to do something

34:57.233 --> 34:59.066
he hasn't done all winter.

34:59.100 --> 35:01.333
He's about to weigh
some gold.

35:03.467 --> 35:04.767
I'm seeing more gold.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.533
The nibbles are
starting to turn yellow.

35:06.567 --> 35:08.567
I feel like the winds...
the winds are in my favor.

35:10.533 --> 35:12.066
We finally have some gold.

35:12.100 --> 35:14.734
I mean, I don't know
how much but hallelujah.

35:14.767 --> 35:17.500
It's a huge weight
off my shoulders.

35:17.533 --> 35:19.567
I'm sure there's gonna be
a big reality check

35:19.600 --> 35:22.934
when we weigh it out,
but at the very least,

35:22.967 --> 35:25.033
we're all gonna get
a little gold in our pockets.

35:25.066 --> 35:26.233
That's pretty good.

35:26.266 --> 35:27.867
There's obviously gold there.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.467
There's no question.

35:30.500 --> 35:32.233
Yeah.

35:32.266 --> 35:33.867
This gold is validation that

35:33.900 --> 35:35.700
what we're doing
can and will pay off.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.533
Gotta dry out the gold.

35:40.734 --> 35:42.100
I'll do a marathon dive

35:42.133 --> 35:44.166
every single day
to feel like this.

35:44.634 --> 35:46.000
What is it?

35:46.033 --> 35:48.066
It always looks like more
when it's in that big pan.

35:51.734 --> 35:53.367
Got a whole ounce here.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.433
Now we're talking.

35:56.333 --> 35:57.900
Yeah.

35:57.934 --> 35:59.433
- All right.
How heavy
that sucker is, man.

35:59.467 --> 36:01.767
Dude, 2.1 ounce.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.133
2.1 ounces

36:03.166 --> 36:05.100
is worth over $3,900.

36:05.133 --> 36:07.500
And while not exactly
breaking the bank,

36:07.533 --> 36:11.033
the Mad Scientist is finally
on the scoreboard.

36:11.066 --> 36:13.834
Yeah, that's good stuff.

36:13.867 --> 36:16.266
Seeing this gold on the scale
pushes back any doubts

36:16.300 --> 36:18.133
that I ever had
about being a miner.

36:18.166 --> 36:19.767
Gold mining is my path.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.800
This certainly
was not Fort Knox,

36:21.834 --> 36:24.567
but it's validation that
what I'm doing is right,

36:24.600 --> 36:26.033
I'm on the right track.

36:26.066 --> 36:27.634
And this motivation
will keep carrying me

36:27.667 --> 36:29.066
through the rest
of the season.

36:29.100 --> 36:30.500
What do you think?
A third ounce of gold,

36:30.533 --> 36:31.767
- will that do you
for this one?
- Third?

36:31.800 --> 36:32.834
Yeah, that'll be fine.

36:34.367 --> 36:37.467
I have to give Steve
some gold for his services.

36:37.500 --> 36:38.767
He's been a huge help to us.

36:39.367 --> 36:40.433
Cool.

36:40.467 --> 36:41.767
All right, third ounce.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.166
There's been some tough times

36:43.200 --> 36:44.567
and he's pulled through for us

36:44.600 --> 36:46.000
- and he deserves it.
It's the only way

36:46.033 --> 36:47.867
I can pay
my hotel bill tonight,

36:47.900 --> 36:49.967
is with this gold.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.533
There's a lot more
where that came from.

36:51.567 --> 36:52.900
We just need to keep at it.

36:55.533 --> 36:57.266
Dude, on to the next hole.

36:57.300 --> 36:58.667
It's yours, something to eat.

36:58.700 --> 37:00.133
This is good for your joints.

37:02.834 --> 37:04.066
Finger licking good.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.300
Across town...

37:19.734 --> 37:21.734
We're close to something big.

37:21.767 --> 37:24.467
We're definitely on the trail.

37:24.500 --> 37:25.900
It's always nice having that

37:25.934 --> 37:27.734
little extra extension
out there

37:27.767 --> 37:30.133
so you can kind of tell
which way the gold's going.

37:30.166 --> 37:33.634
A little dangerous
but definitely makes it
interesting, doesn't it?

37:34.900 --> 37:36.533
Shawn Pomrenke

37:36.567 --> 37:38.300
may not have hit
the golden jackpot

37:38.333 --> 37:41.133
but good weather
and a hose extension

37:41.166 --> 37:44.367
were a winning combination
that kept him on the trail.

37:44.400 --> 37:47.967
Magnetite black sand,
it's there.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.033
It's just we got to,
just sniffin' it out.

37:52.233 --> 37:54.200
I've been doing this
a lot of years

37:54.233 --> 37:56.166
and seeing all these
heavy materials,

37:56.200 --> 37:58.467
it's like a bat signal.

37:58.500 --> 38:02.133
Let's dry this stuff out
and, uh, weigh it up.

38:02.166 --> 38:04.467
It's not a question of
if we find the jackpot,

38:04.500 --> 38:05.500
it's a matter of when.

38:05.967 --> 38:06.967
See what we got.

38:10.433 --> 38:13.567
Four, five, six.

38:14.133 --> 38:17.934
Ooh, seven, eight, nine,

38:17.967 --> 38:20.600
ten, eleven, twelve.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.233
This is looking good.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.400
15.5.

38:27.433 --> 38:28.467
Oh, yeah.

38:28.500 --> 38:29.967
Hell, yeah, it's in there.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.333
- Getting better.
Yeah, I know.

38:32.367 --> 38:33.734
Things are picking up.

38:33.767 --> 38:34.667
Yup.
Not bad.

38:34.700 --> 38:36.133
Oh, I'll take it.

38:36.166 --> 38:39.834
15.5 ounce
is worth over $29,000,

38:39.867 --> 38:43.433
just a taste of the payday
that Mr. Gold believes

38:43.467 --> 38:46.767
is right around the corner
as he creeps ever closer

38:46.800 --> 38:48.867
to the 120 ounce he needs.

38:49.634 --> 38:50.967
We're on the trail now.

38:52.667 --> 38:54.367
This winter just keeps
getting better.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.734
I'm gonna be able to
make all my payments

38:56.767 --> 38:59.667
and I'm gonna find that
jackpot, mark my word.

38:59.700 --> 39:02.500
We're gonna hit some bigger
gold here sooner or later.

39:03.433 --> 39:05.367
We need to keep it up, Joe.

39:07.667 --> 39:08.834
Across town...

39:16.533 --> 39:17.367
We have gold.

39:19.567 --> 39:21.000
Oh, yeah, look at that.

39:22.867 --> 39:24.700
All right, Gary.
Let's weigh this one up.

39:24.734 --> 39:26.567
See how we did.

39:26.600 --> 39:29.367
After a double dive with
double the time on the box,

39:30.066 --> 39:31.600
Vernon Adkison's hoping

39:31.634 --> 39:34.233
for double the gold
on the scales.

39:34.266 --> 39:36.600
What I was seeing
in the camera, that ground

39:36.634 --> 39:38.300
looked to me
like it's untouched.

39:38.333 --> 39:39.233
Yeah.

39:39.266 --> 39:40.867
Well, let's see what we got.

39:42.467 --> 39:47.100
Two, four, ten,

39:47.133 --> 39:49.000
sixteen, seventeen,

39:49.033 --> 39:53.867
eighteen, nineteen, and 20.52.

39:54.834 --> 39:56.767
I'll take it.

39:56.800 --> 40:01.800
20.52 ounce is worth
a little north of $38,000.

40:01.834 --> 40:04.200
That's the best clean-out
we've had in a while.

40:04.233 --> 40:05.600
Yeah, that's good right there.

40:05.634 --> 40:07.467
That's a nice one right there.

40:07.500 --> 40:11.233
I feel like there's
been a sea change
since bought '56.

40:11.266 --> 40:14.600
We're operating on an entirely
different level now.

40:14.634 --> 40:17.367
We keep getting gold
like we have been,

40:17.400 --> 40:20.266
this might be a record
breaking season for me.

40:20.300 --> 40:21.600
Well, hey, I'm happy.

40:21.634 --> 40:22.934
Let's go get some chow.

40:22.967 --> 40:24.500
- I'll buy you a beer.
- All right. All right.

40:28.233 --> 40:30.734
The break in the weather
has rallied the fleet

40:30.767 --> 40:33.367
as Shawn and Vernon
keep flying high.

40:33.400 --> 40:36.133
While Zeke finally lands
on the scoreboard

40:36.166 --> 40:38.567
and the Kellys continue
to stumble.

40:40.266 --> 40:43.200
Next time on
Bering Sea Gold...

40:48.467 --> 40:50.266
So we're gonna put up
the Irish flag.

40:50.300 --> 40:51.800
This is gonna change our luck.

40:51.834 --> 40:53.166
Today's the day.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.667
We're gonna find
something big.

40:54.700 --> 40:57.734
We got some kind of
short here, guys.

40:59.166 --> 41:00.800
They have to send
the helicopter out

41:00.834 --> 41:02.233
to rescue him.

41:02.266 --> 41:03.834
He stretched all the way out.

41:07.767 --> 41:09.200
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

41:09.233 --> 41:11.333
Yeah. Your life
could turn around

41:11.367 --> 41:12.567
in a matter of an hour.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.533
Oh, baby.

41:14.567 --> 41:15.734
Oh, wow.

41:15.767 --> 41:17.934
- There's a pile of gold.
- Yeah.

41:17.967 --> 41:19.867
I haven't ever
seen anything like it.
