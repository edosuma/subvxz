00:02.036 --> 00:05.471
How would you
describe your style?

00:05.473 --> 00:09.708
Smart and sassy,
bold and brassy,
or clean and classy?

00:10.211 --> 00:11.510
Bold and brassy.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.213
Next question.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.648
How many times do
you do it in a week?

00:16.650 --> 00:17.683
Do what?

00:17.685 --> 00:22.855
It doesn't say.
I'll put seven.
Lucky number.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.556
What kind of kisser
are you?

00:24.558 --> 00:28.093
Soft and supple,
long and lingering,
or wet and wild?

00:28.362 --> 00:29.428
Who I kissing?

00:29.597 --> 00:31.363
It doesn't say.
Third one.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.531
Wet and wild.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.665
What you doing?

00:33.667 --> 00:35.267
Taking a quiz.

00:35.269 --> 00:38.170
Your husband
is a Rachel.
- What?

00:38.172 --> 00:39.638
That's the kind
of friend you are.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.108
I'm a Phoebe.
My dog Ginger
is a total Joey.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.177
I never watch
that TV show.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.279
What TV show?

01:11.739 --> 01:13.772
You want those
labels facing forward.

01:13.774 --> 01:14.840
Great managing.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.241
Assistant managing.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.409
For now.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.579
You tell Shannon yet?
No, because it's not for sure.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.815
Jung Kim, working for
the competition.

01:22.817 --> 01:24.850
It's just a second interview.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.251
But, yeah, they love me.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.753
Maybe I'll apply
for your job.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.321
I think I'm ready
to watch people work

01:29.323 --> 01:31.356
And pretend I care
which way the labels
are facing.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.925
Just wait for me
to get officially hired.

01:32.927 --> 01:35.360
Then make your move.
Then we'll all go celebrate.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.628
Celebrate what?

01:37.531 --> 01:38.597
I, uh...

01:39.400 --> 01:42.201
I just got my GED.

01:42.503 --> 01:46.238
That's great.
Oh! Congratulations!

01:46.874 --> 01:48.240
We should celebrate.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.410
Ah. You don't have
to do anything.
You only graduate once.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.912
I missed my prom. Mono.

01:53.914 --> 01:57.683
Not the good kind from kissing
but the confusing kind
from dance class.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.619
Seriously,
we need to mark
the occasion.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.387
Okay, but nothing big.
- Yeah, no.

02:02.389 --> 02:04.556
Just a drink after work.
We can even do it here.

02:04.558 --> 02:07.426
Sounds fun.
We get overtime
for this celebration?

02:07.428 --> 02:09.261
Uh... No.
- So just time and a half.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.896
I'll let everyone know.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.537
So what's the deal
with this bike?

02:18.539 --> 02:20.606
It's Gerald’s cousin's.
We're motorcycle-sitting.

02:20.608 --> 02:21.707
Is it broken?

02:21.709 --> 02:24.409
You were leaking a little oil,
so I just tightened
the clutch cover.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.286
Keep an eye on it.
Could be the gasket.
Totally.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.021
Yeah, I thought those gaskets
were looking a little soft.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.484
So what do we have to do?
nothing.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.419
Just fire it up
every once in a while,
keep it clean.

02:34.421 --> 02:35.687
Nice bike.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.789
Janet!
Janet!

02:37.791 --> 02:40.225
Back here, umma.

02:40.227 --> 02:43.595
I think you is dead.
I ring doorbell 100 times.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.831
Hi, umma.
- Jung! What you doing here?

02:45.833 --> 02:46.999
Just helping out.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.401
Ah! Such a good boy.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.736
Here. Your mail.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.773
Why is it open?
Humidity.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.342
Oh, hey! It came!

03:00.648 --> 03:03.348
Look, they printed
one of my photos.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.218
Oh! That's huge.
Cool.

03:08.455 --> 03:09.471
You get paid for that?

03:09.472 --> 03:10.488
Well, no,
but it's really
good exposure, and...

03:10.491 --> 03:12.424
Jung,
you tell Janet
the good news?

03:12.426 --> 03:14.393
Jung get the GED!
Can you believe?

03:14.395 --> 03:15.861
He finish high school!

03:16.297 --> 03:18.564
Wow. That's great.
Welcome to the club, man.

03:18.566 --> 03:19.631
So proud.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.733
Okay, thank you, umma,
but I've got to get going.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.436
Kimchee does not like it
when I'm late
for frittata night.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.772
Breakfast for dinner.
Very cool.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.475
Whose is?

03:31.512 --> 03:33.272
Don't freak out.
Gerald's cousin
left it here.

03:33.614 --> 03:34.880
I'm not going to, like,
ride it or anything.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.982
Why are you laughing?

03:37.484 --> 03:41.520
Oh, Janet, you is not
motorcycle-style.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.654
Why are you laughing?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.489
I don't know.
She's infectious.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.506
I thought we said no
texting during dinner?

04:01.508 --> 04:02.574
Sorry.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.376
Don't tell me.
Tell the frittata.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.444
It's my appa.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.913
He sent me a Korean flag
and seven thumbs up.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.448
How are you supposed
to respond to that?

04:09.450 --> 04:11.850
Turkey, turkey, taco.
Works for everything.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.286
Totally.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.721
"Totally."

04:19.260 --> 04:21.326
Mr. Kim,
could you give me a hand?

04:21.328 --> 04:22.995
My eyes are bigger
than my arms.

04:23.530 --> 04:24.696
Maybe if I...

04:29.370 --> 04:31.436
The important thing is
that nobody got hurt.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.438
Important thing is you pay.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.742
That's good.
Humor helps in
situations like this.

04:36.744 --> 04:37.776
What happen?

04:37.778 --> 04:39.678
Enrique happen.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.883
Jung? You texting with Jung?

04:45.486 --> 04:46.685
Yeah.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.887
Oh, my g!

04:48.889 --> 04:50.822
Why you not tell me?
It's no big deal.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.524
It's so big deal.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.459
I never thought
I would live
to see the day.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.561
I mean, I only knew
for a short of time.

04:56.563 --> 04:59.631
Appa!
- What a wonderful reunion.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.832
What you doing?

05:00.834 --> 05:03.835
I'm getting swept
up in the moment.

05:03.837 --> 05:04.936
I can clean.

05:04.938 --> 05:10.642
We can have our
whole family together.
It's been so long time.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.746
Yeah. Maybe. Soon.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.380
Have to have a party,
huh? I make Jung
all his favourite food.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.016
Ddukbokki, haemul pajeon...

05:18.018 --> 05:20.852
No party. See?
This is why I not tell you.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.921
You always push
too much, too fast.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.957
Okay, I not push.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.961
What's turkey, turkey, taco?

05:29.963 --> 05:31.797
I used to play that
in school.

05:31.799 --> 05:35.100
You do not want to be
the taco. Believe me.

05:40.641 --> 05:43.575
I mean, I know
I didn't get paid
for the photo,

05:43.577 --> 05:46.712
But it's a provincially
distributed magazine.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.980
Plus, more people will
see it 'cause it's free.

05:48.982 --> 05:52.918
But she just went
on and on about Jung’s GED.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.687
He graduated high school.
We've all done it.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.890
Yeah, but it's harder
to do when you're 26,

05:58.892 --> 06:00.759
Though I wouldn't
mind going back now.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.694
Could finally make
the basketball team.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.930
I graduated top of my class,

06:04.932 --> 06:06.531
Not that anyone noticed.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.100
I guess that's what you get
for being the good one.

06:08.102 --> 06:09.401
Your family loves you.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.963
No one's going to bench you
just because Jung’s
back on the scene.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.024
That's not
what this is about.

06:16.025 --> 06:18.488
He may be the starting center,
but you're still
a solid point guard.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.412
You didn't make the team.
Get over it.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.114
Well, I had the technique.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.021
Uh...

06:30.023 --> 06:31.656
How many spikes
does your fork have?

06:32.025 --> 06:33.158
I wouldn't worry about it.

06:33.160 --> 06:37.996
Okay, I know we said
no theme, but, honestly,
it found itself.

06:38.699 --> 06:39.931
"Under the sea."

06:39.933 --> 06:42.501
I'm with you.
Like sharks and skeletons.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.669
And Alejandro
let me borrow some

06:44.671 --> 06:46.905
Endangered coral
from his scuba trip.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.774
I feel like this might not be
about me anymore.

06:48.776 --> 06:49.608
I know. I know.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.610
Maybe there's
a small part of me

06:51.612 --> 06:53.178
That's overcompensating
for my prom.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.513
Yeah. Maybe a little bit.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.582
It's just that I had
everything worked out
to the tiniest detail.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.786
My corsage was
this gorgeous orchid.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.488
I tried to press it in a book,
but I just ruined the orchid.

07:03.490 --> 07:04.589
And the book.

07:04.591 --> 07:08.894
Well, if you need
anyone to assist you
while you manage this party,

07:08.896 --> 07:10.061
I'd be happy to help.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.497
Ah. Streamer duty?
Oh! I'd be honored.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.965
Whoa.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.034
I think that
little guy's lost.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.036
I think that
little guy's my sister.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.438
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.141
What are you doing?

07:24.144 --> 07:25.644
Just in the neighbourhood.
On the old crotch rocket.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.078
Please don't say
"crotch rocket."

07:27.080 --> 07:28.213
When did you start riding?

07:28.215 --> 07:30.782
When didn't I ride?
Very recently.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.652
Well, a 15-minute written test
changed all that.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.955
I think you look so cool.
- Thanks.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.057
Like bad sandy at
the end of <i>Grease.</i>

07:39.059 --> 07:40.158
Yeah, it's pretty funny.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.894
You're getting all
scholarly and square,
and I'm riding a bike now.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.062
Taking life at
60 clicks an hour.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.030
That's not very fast.

07:45.032 --> 07:48.967
Sometimes 80 clicks.
Just don't tell umma and appa.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.002
They would freak.

07:51.004 --> 07:54.272
Sorry, I have to take this.
It's a phone call.

07:54.274 --> 07:57.275
Is it them?
Don't tell them
I'm riding a motorcycle.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.977
Busted.
- It's not.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.947
Okay, seriously,
where are they going?

08:10.724 --> 08:12.224
So you talk to Jung lately?

08:12.226 --> 08:14.526
Yeah, we text a little bit.

08:14.528 --> 08:15.961
So I guess he told you.

08:15.963 --> 08:18.530
Yeah. Kimchee eat
whole fork.

08:18.532 --> 08:21.967
No, about what
old Janet is up to
and her need for speed.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.869
Old Janet is
always late for work.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.804
Maybe it's time
for new Janet, huh?

08:25.806 --> 08:29.074
I get ticket.
Right near first base.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.542
Oh, hi, Janet.

08:30.544 --> 08:31.443
You guys going to a game?

08:31.445 --> 08:34.646
Appa giving to Jung,
graduation present.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.781
Ah.
Just a little something.
Oh.

08:36.783 --> 08:41.086
Long time ago,
appa and Jung always go
to watch blue jay game.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.621
Well, I'm sure
he'll love it.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.022
As much as I loved
the present you gave me

08:44.024 --> 08:45.690
When I graduated
from high school.

08:45.692 --> 08:46.791
Yeah, exactly.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.760
I didn't get one!

08:48.762 --> 08:50.629
I don't want to fight.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.731
Also, Janet,
can you work store

08:52.733 --> 08:54.866
So we can go to handy
for Jung party?

08:54.868 --> 08:55.867
Seriously?

08:55.869 --> 08:59.671
No. Maybe
we close the store,
so we can all...

08:59.673 --> 09:02.507
You're closing the store for this?
You never close the store.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.976
Yeah, we close the store
that time Jung was sick.

09:06.713 --> 09:10.849
Also, this time when whole family go
to handy party together.

09:10.851 --> 09:15.120
Well, good, close the store, then,
and I'll see you at the party.

09:16.156 --> 09:19.224
I'll definitely
see you at the party.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.993
Yeah, we hear you
first time.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.069
Hey, there, Mr. Workaholic,
put away that clipboard.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.038
It's prom night. Almost.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.641
Not really. Just drinks.
A few nibbles. Super low-key.

09:36.643 --> 09:39.578
Sorry, I'm almost done.
This last drop-off was seriously...

09:40.147 --> 09:41.279
Wow.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.583
You dressed up.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.218
I actually considered looking
for my old prom dress,

09:47.220 --> 09:49.988
But then I remembered my dad
burned it because of the mono.

09:49.990 --> 09:52.924
Kind of a real life nod
to <i>The Velveteen Rabbit.</i>

09:53.126 --> 09:54.726
Well, you look great,

09:54.728 --> 09:58.029
Although you are missing
a little something.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.273
Um...

10:08.609 --> 10:09.774
Uh... Wrist.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.076
Right.

10:13.680 --> 10:17.215
Thanks for the party.
Thanks for...

10:25.692 --> 10:29.928
Paper towels, paper towels.
There's a huge spill out there.

10:31.698 --> 10:32.964
She's got it.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.000
Oh! Wait. You don't
have the paper towels!

10:48.815 --> 10:50.215
Kimch, have you seen
Shannon around?

10:50.217 --> 10:52.050
You mean my new boss?
I mean your current boss.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.151
You know what I mean.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.987
I think she's avoiding me.
Dude, it's in your head.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.222
She's probably not
thinking about you at all.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.823
I doubt that's true.

10:58.825 --> 10:59.825
What did you do?

11:00.627 --> 11:02.027
What makes you think
I did anything?

11:02.062 --> 11:03.728
I'll just ask her.
Hey, Shannon!

11:05.432 --> 11:08.333
Hey, party cats.
- Hey.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.335
Everything looks so good.
Thanks.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.872
Hey, boss, you see this streamer curl?
Whoo!

11:13.874 --> 11:15.440
You asked, I delivered.

11:15.442 --> 11:18.910
I guess you can call me
the delivery manager.

11:18.912 --> 11:22.914
You know what? I, uh, forgot the cupcakes.
They're in my office.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.083
I'm just gonna go grab them.
I'll get them for you, boss.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.719
Oh. No, you don't have to.
No. It's no trouble at all.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.091
So, earlier...

11:33.093 --> 11:34.359
You know what?
There are way too many

11:34.361 --> 11:35.860
Cupcakes for him
to handle by himself.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.395
I'm just going to
go give him a hand.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.800
There aren't as many
as she thinks.

11:41.935 --> 11:45.236
So many people here already.
Jung have lots of friends.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.505
Maybe they have to come,
to keep job.

11:48.075 --> 11:51.076
Watch where you going!

12:01.354 --> 12:02.954
Sorry. Did I scare you?

12:02.956 --> 12:06.157
I don't know what he saying.
Did I scare you?

12:06.159 --> 12:08.093
We can't hear
with the helmet on.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.929
Janet?
- Wha...

12:10.931 --> 12:12.797
What you doing
riding motorcycle?

12:12.799 --> 12:14.165
I guess it's just my style.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.835
You're going to hurt yourself
or us and everybody.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.236
Yeah. How fast
you think you go?

12:19.239 --> 12:21.773
Probably too fast.
Very dangerous.

12:22.109 --> 12:26.177
I going inside.
You can talk motorcycle
if you want.

12:26.179 --> 12:29.814
Janet, this is
a very bad idea, hmm?

12:29.816 --> 12:31.116
And...

12:31.118 --> 12:33.084
Maybe after,
you give to me ride?

12:33.086 --> 12:34.786
I'm gonna go park.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.390
This is fun.
- Yeah.

12:40.527 --> 12:44.362
We should do more of these parties.
Do you know what it's for?

12:58.111 --> 12:59.277
Shit.

12:59.279 --> 13:05.049
There he is. Go. Go.
I want to watch you talk and smile.

13:05.051 --> 13:07.786
Yeah, have to go.
- Yeah. Go.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.521
No, have to "go" go.

13:09.523 --> 13:10.822
Then hurry up.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.925
Jung!

13:13.927 --> 13:16.327
You looking for appa?
He just go to bathroom.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.863
Janet coming soon.
Then whole family together.

13:18.865 --> 13:19.931
Great.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.173
I bring all
your favourite food.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.903
You know what, umma?
I'll be right back.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.405
Jung? Don't go too far.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.541
What you doing?

13:29.943 --> 13:31.976
It's okay. I work here.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.581
There you are.
Here I am.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.317
I was here,
but now I'm gonna go there.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.351
Wait.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.391
Nope. Nope. Wrong.
Not going to do that.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.226
What's wrong?
I thought that we both...

13:48.228 --> 13:51.229
We did. I did.
But I don't.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.298
You threw me a prom.
So?

13:53.300 --> 13:54.899
So people don't
just throw proms

13:54.901 --> 13:56.461
For people they don't
have feelings for.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.403
Yeah, they do. They're called
prom committees.

13:58.405 --> 14:01.172
And you don't just kiss someone
after they've peed.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.507
You kissed me.

14:02.509 --> 14:06.211
Well, whatever feelings
I may or may not have,

14:06.213 --> 14:07.879
I'm in a relationship.

14:07.881 --> 14:10.181
Alejandro and I
are in a good place right now.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.117
And I don't want to wreck
our whole work-buddy thing.

14:13.119 --> 14:15.987
You don't have to worry
about that anymore. I took another job.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.090
What?
Yeah, as a manager.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.625
Comfort car rental.

14:21.261 --> 14:26.264
So while I was planning you a party,
you knew you were leaving.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.466
Well, I just found out about it yesterday.
I was going to tell you.

14:28.468 --> 14:31.402
When? After you gave me
the corsage of lies?

14:31.404 --> 14:32.470
Shannon.

14:32.472 --> 14:36.441
It's too bad because I write
really great recommendation letters.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.509
Not just "to whom it may concern."

14:38.511 --> 14:40.478
I do the research.
It's the personal details.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.289
Oh...

14:51.291 --> 14:52.523
Jung.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.692
Hey. Sorry,
I didn't see you there.

14:54.694 --> 14:59.530
It's okay. I just looking,
huh? You work with lots of good car.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.132
Thanks.

15:01.134 --> 15:05.036
Volvo, Audi, any Genesis?
Huh?

15:05.038 --> 15:07.005
Genesis. It's a Hyundai.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.173
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, a few.

15:09.175 --> 15:10.208
Ah.

15:11.011 --> 15:15.046
I am happy for you.
Con-graduation.

15:15.048 --> 15:18.082
Thanks.
- Con-graduation.

15:18.084 --> 15:21.452
Hey, appa, why don't you join
the party? I'll be right in.

15:21.454 --> 15:24.622
What's wrong?
Nothing. I just need, um...

15:24.624 --> 15:26.190
You know what?
Why don't we just go in there?

15:26.192 --> 15:28.059
No. You have a problem. Hmm?

15:28.061 --> 15:31.262
You have <i>jureumjin,</i>
just like when you
were a little boy.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.298
Exactly same.
Yeah, well, I'm not a kid anymore.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.033
Ooh. Look. There's again.

15:35.035 --> 15:38.369
Let's just go find umma.
No. You tell to me you problem.

15:38.371 --> 15:41.105
I help you fix.
That's what appa do.

15:43.209 --> 15:45.727
It's fine.

15:45.728 --> 15:48.246
You always running away from you problem.
That's you problem.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.515
And your problem is you think you
know better than everyone else,

15:50.517 --> 15:51.582
But you don't.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.052
You never did.
- Okay.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.320
You solve problem
by yourself.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.554
I've been doing that
on my own for a while now.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.624
Maybe you not on your own if you
listen to people who know better.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.359
I'm fine.
- Then why you have <i>jureumjin?</i>

16:01.361 --> 16:02.961
Don't touch me.
I not touch you!

16:05.598 --> 16:07.598
I don't need this.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.101
You think I need this?
Huh? Nobody need this!

16:10.103 --> 16:12.303
I'm going this way.
Yeah. That's why
I go this way.

16:19.112 --> 16:22.280
This is old-timey.
This puts bunny ears on everyone.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.048
This is fisheye.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.284
You have filter
for regular picture?

16:26.286 --> 16:27.352
Uh...

16:27.354 --> 16:28.987
You'd think
there's got to be.

16:31.091 --> 16:34.225
What's wrong? You have <i>jureumjin.</i>
Nothing. Let's go.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.761
You talk to Jung?
So stubborn.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.099
You so stubborn.
Why you do like this?

16:41.501 --> 16:42.667
Where's Jung?

16:42.669 --> 16:44.035
He left.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.204
He left?

16:52.145 --> 16:53.544
Got it.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.318
Hello? Somebody?

17:02.322 --> 17:04.188
Somebody?

17:04.190 --> 17:05.690
Janet?

17:06.559 --> 17:08.359
Hello?

17:16.202 --> 17:19.537
Are you hurt?
No, I'm fine. I'm okay.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.777
Ow. Okay.
My side's a little sore.
Oh!

17:25.779 --> 17:28.146
Yeah, motorcycle was on.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.381
I'm usually better
at parking.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.816
Here, sit.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.719
Doesn't mean
I'm not motorcycle-style.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.792
Remember when you and Jung
share bunk bed?

17:42.062 --> 17:46.497
Every night, you stuff pillow
in pajama.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.066
I was worried
I'd fall out.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.268
You sleep bottom bunk.

17:51.404 --> 17:55.339
You is a safe girl.
If you want to ride,
you can ride.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.776
Thanks, but I'm not really
asking your permission.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.679
Too bad. I already give to you.
No take-back.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.749
Umma, were you smoking?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.684
I think you hit head
too hard.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.352
You know
it's really bad for you.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.321
Not as bad as motorcycle.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.123
Worse.
- You worse.

18:16.196 --> 18:20.264
So what I'm doing now is, I put
my left leg in the pants first.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.066
Noticed a difference
right away.

18:23.837 --> 18:25.837
Now this is where you tell me
something about you.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.472
I find Janet.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.873
Yeah, pretty embarrassing.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.776
I was in the parking lot...
Fixing bike. So good at.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.478
How is that embarrassing?

18:33.480 --> 18:37.315
Hey! There he is.
Are we getting this picture or what?

18:37.317 --> 18:40.151
Getting late.
Maybe another time.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.086
We're all here.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.090
So everybody get together.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.332
You okay?
- I don't want to talk about it.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.200
Regular filter please.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.372
Say Kim-cheese.

19:01.374 --> 19:02.507
Terence!
- What?

19:02.509 --> 19:04.275
Okay, one more.
This time, panorama.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.610
We go now.

19:05.612 --> 19:09.780
Okay, I already started,
so this is going to get weird.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.755
I am really excited.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.658
I've already given my notice,
and I'm ready to go.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.327
I can go in
any direction you like.

19:24.197 --> 19:25.329
Oh.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.300
You mean you're going
in a different direction.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.804
Background check. Right.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.275
I mean, those records
are from a long time ago.

19:39.145 --> 19:41.479
Yeah, you, too.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.786
Guess what?
Shannon just gave me your old job.

19:50.223 --> 19:51.956
Grab a cup.
We're celebrating.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.958
Wow. That's great!

19:53.960 --> 19:56.327
We're gonna have
an apartment full of managers.

19:56.329 --> 20:00.264
Well, technically, I'm an assistant
manager, but I can still fire Terence.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.267
Dude, congrats.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.441
Mmm. That is not good.

20:10.443 --> 20:11.809
I'll get the beer.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.481
Look, family picture.

20:17.483 --> 20:19.717
With <i>meongcheong</i> Terence.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.420
Still, family picture.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.956
Yeah, it's nice.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.792
I go put on
"don't touch" wall.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.896
I know I'm late.
I'll stay longer.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.631
Hi, Janet.
- Hi, umma.

20:33.633 --> 20:37.735
Even with motorcycle, old Janet is still slow.
Huh?

20:38.671 --> 20:40.705
Happy two-year-late
graduation.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.378
Are these the same tickets
you were gonna give to...

20:47.380 --> 20:49.747
You don't want?
No. I want. I want.

20:52.619 --> 20:55.853
Thank you. Gerald's gonna be so excited.
- Hmm.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.388
These are great seats.

20:57.390 --> 21:00.024
Oh. Yeah. Have a fun time.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.793
I was kidding. Of course,
I'm gonna take you.

21:02.996 --> 21:04.395
Yeah, okay.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.030
It'll be fun.
- Yeah.

21:06.032 --> 21:11.035
And you can buy for me "happy five-month-late
birthday" hot dog.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.904
And "happy late
father day" beer.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.741
And, uh, "thank you
for tuition" nachos. Huh?

21:18.478 --> 21:19.722
Now I'm thinking
I'll take Gerald.

21:19.746 --> 21:20.811
Uh...
