13:14.995 --> 13:16.196
Jake?

13:17.430 --> 13:19.066
Do I know you?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.902
No.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.273

[Music continues]

14:00.273 --> 14:02.309
Take care.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.377
We are closed.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.479
I'm so glad this day is over.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.281
I'll lock up.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.084
Excuse me, sir,
we're closed.

14:11.118 --> 14:12.953
Can I help you
with anything?

14:12.986 --> 14:18.458
Yeah, I was wondering if
you had these in a size 11?

14:20.460 --> 14:23.396
Or these guys?

14:24.531 --> 14:25.966
-What...
-Lizard skin or...

14:25.999 --> 14:29.002
-...are you doing here?
-...Emu skin.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.305
Nice to see you
too, Becca.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.907
Becca: What do you want?

14:33.941 --> 14:35.142
Jake: Looking at boots.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.945
You don't want boots.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.413
Look, I...

14:44.017 --> 14:45.352
I need
to talk to you.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.120
Why?

14:47.154 --> 14:48.588
Why not?

14:48.621 --> 14:50.157
Gimme one
good reason.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.929
Will you
please leave?

14:57.697 --> 14:59.099
Becca, I'm just--

15:04.237 --> 15:05.405
Okay.

15:12.379 --> 15:16.016
Was that Jake reeson?

15:16.383 --> 15:18.318
Yes.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.454
He is so cute.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.623

15:23.656 --> 15:24.992
Oh, I don't know him.

I just played
a show with him once.

Well, we used to
date, actually--

15:35.668 --> 15:38.071
[screaming]

15:38.105 --> 15:40.040
It's not nice to
sneak up on people.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.308
It's not nice to ask
someone to leave

15:41.341 --> 15:42.709
when they're trying
to talk to you, Becca.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.144
It's never been
just talk with you.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.178
Just give me 60 seconds.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.980
How did you
know I worked here?

15:47.014 --> 15:49.449
Bobby's sister
told me.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.583
The answer
is still no.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.684
-Why?
-Well, I like to talk.

-Hey.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.588
-Zoey, no.
-Hi.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.557
Because I know that you--

15:57.590 --> 15:59.059
whoa, wait,
why not?

15:59.092 --> 16:02.729
Because he-- 'cause i--
you need to go.

16:02.762 --> 16:05.165
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.433
-No, really I don't.
-She really doesn't.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.036
Mm-hmm.
Well, I do.
And she's my ride.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.438
-You drove today.
-No, I didn't.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.073
-Yeah.
-Yeah, mm-hmm.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.008
-She's right.
-I'm pretty sure you did.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.576
You have a car
in the parking lot.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.778
-Come on.
-Bye, Jake.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.680
Are you crazy?
He is hot.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.249
I know.

I'm not gonna
give up that easy.

Suit yourself.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.323
Look, I want to make
it up to you.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.559
You could never
make it up to me.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.597
Someone once told me
that everyone deserves
a second chance.

16:41.401 --> 16:42.669
Fine.

16:42.702 --> 16:46.273
I'll accept your offer,
but first you must do
something with me.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.741
And what
is that something?

16:48.775 --> 16:50.777
Meet me tomorrow
and find out.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.645
-It's a date.
-It's not a date.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.281
-Sounds like a date.
-Forget it.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.116
Okay, okay.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.751
But if I go with you, then
you have to let me take you out

16:58.785 --> 17:01.188
on a real date,
dinner, a movie.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.156
-We can do coffee.
-Coffee!

-How about a beer or two?
-Just coffee.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.160
-You used to be fun.
-You used to be nice.

Here, tomorrow.

It's not a date.

same as every other day.

been trying to tell you.

why don't you talk to him

would have picked for a date.

We help feed lower income and
homeless families once a week.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.078
So this is
your idea of a date?

24:06.112 --> 24:07.947
I never said
anything about a date.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.082
But you
meant a date.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.217
I said food
would be served.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.486
Which usually
indicates a date.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.821
Fine, you want to leave?

24:15.555 --> 24:16.923
No.
Hold on.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.459
You're right,
we made the deal.

but you're not getting me
to wear the hairnet.

wear the hairnet.

doing here?

hand out the biscuits.

two a minute to talk.

-You too.

you find me?

26:20.747 --> 26:23.349
I called every
motel in town.

I'm glad
you did.

this big concert thing.

years to try and Bury

26:38.330 --> 26:40.667
all the bad memories
I have of you.

26:43.169 --> 26:46.005
Seeing you the other day
at my door,

26:46.038 --> 26:49.909
it was like
I was experiencing
them for the first time.

26:49.942 --> 26:55.715
When you first left,
I prayed to god every day

26:55.748 --> 26:58.751
that he was gonna
bring you back to us.

26:58.785 --> 27:05.257
We needed you so bad,
especially our son.

27:05.291 --> 27:09.662
He would ask me every day,
"when is my daddy coming home?"

27:11.297 --> 27:15.367
I was so lost when
you abandoned us.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.203
And I didn't know
what to say.

27:19.238 --> 27:22.709
After a while, I realized
you were never coming home,

27:24.443 --> 27:27.947
so I told him that you
were in heaven with god.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.919
It killed me
to lie to him.

27:34.386 --> 27:39.125
And then my hope turned to

were not gonna say that.

I could ever say to take
away the pain I caused.

in your heart
to forgive me.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.027

seeking my forgiveness.

seeking his.

answered here today was why.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.277
Why?

But after seeing you, it
just doesn't matter anymore.

still thinking you were dead.

got back.

Look, whatever you're
going through, Jake,
I want you to know that...

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:18.068
That I care and that
god cares and that--

01:02:18.102 --> 01:02:19.269
[scoffing]

Yes, I do,
with all my heart.

01:02:41.558 --> 01:02:44.261
What do you know
about real pain, Becca?

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:49.199
You're just a good little church
girl now, who's gonna wind up

01:02:49.233 --> 01:02:52.269
marrying some good
little church boy
one day

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:55.039
and living
happily ever after.

01:02:56.573 --> 01:02:58.775
There's something
I never told you.

01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:01.879
Um...

01:03:04.148 --> 01:03:07.484
When we were living
in Nashville after
my father died,

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:10.220
my momma
flipped out and, uh...

01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:18.795
And I started using every kind
of drug I could get a hold of.

01:03:19.964 --> 01:03:22.599
When my mom found out,
she said I could get help,

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:26.203
or she was kicking me
out of the house.

01:03:26.236 --> 01:03:30.407
And so being the angry
person that I was,

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.077
I just did more
and more drugs.

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:35.345
And then one day
when I was already high,

01:03:39.616 --> 01:03:41.351
I just wanted to end it all.

01:03:42.586 --> 01:03:45.990
But just before
I cut my wrists,

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.226
I said a prayer...

01:03:53.297 --> 01:03:55.966
Asking god to forgive me.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:58.835
And he answered...

01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:03.607
'Cause I heard
a voice that said,

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.376
"you need to ask god
to save you."

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:11.115
So, do I believe in a god

01:04:12.649 --> 01:04:14.919

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:17.988

one day you do too.

01:15:26.055 --> 01:15:28.858
Pretty hard to do anything
when you're in the dark.

for your present?

01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:25.148
Happy birthday, son.

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:28.117
Thank you, daddy.

Mom.

01:18:46.255 --> 01:18:48.157
My god, your face!

01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:49.492
What happened?

01:18:49.525 --> 01:18:51.795
It's not important.

01:18:53.262 --> 01:18:55.064
Can we talk
for a minute?

01:18:55.098 --> 01:18:56.265
Of course.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.339
Why didn't you ever
tell me the truth about him?

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:11.180
You would ask me every
day, "where's my daddy?

"Where's Lily?"

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:19.322
I just-- it killed me to see
what it was doing to you

01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:22.892
and I didn't know
what to do,

01:19:23.993 --> 01:19:27.130
so I thought I did
what was right.

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:30.867
I thought that if you
thought that

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:35.171
they were both together
in heaven, that you would
eventually be okay with that.

01:19:39.008 --> 01:19:40.977
I know now
that I was wrong.

01:19:42.145 --> 01:19:45.281
I don't like
who I am anymore, mom.

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:48.918
And I can't help
but think that if...

01:19:51.855 --> 01:19:53.556
If my father had
have been there

01:19:53.589 --> 01:19:58.828
all those years that
I'd be a different person,

01:19:59.996 --> 01:20:01.797
that I'd be
a better man.

01:20:05.068 --> 01:20:06.970
It's never too late
to change.

01:20:07.003 --> 01:20:08.071
Yeah.

01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:18.915
I really just tried
to protect us both.

Please.

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.963
After Lily died,
your dad was
just a broken man

01:20:33.997 --> 01:20:35.064
and all he did
was drink.

01:20:35.098 --> 01:20:37.166
You don't remember
what it was like.

01:20:40.269 --> 01:20:41.370

isn't here, son.

was staying here.

to Houston.

not to join us.

this morning.

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:33.649
You know where
he was going?

man, Jake.

very much.

is a powerful thing.

to receive.
