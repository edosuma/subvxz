00:31.880 --> 00:34.047
Oh, man,
two blocks from the barn.

00:42.557 --> 00:44.591
Hands on your head.

00:46.427 --> 00:48.729
Come on, man!
Ow. Ow.

00:48.763 --> 00:50.898
Hey! Ow!

00:50.932 --> 00:52.232
Put 'em out.

00:52.267 --> 00:54.067
You got anything sharp
in your pockets?

00:54.102 --> 00:55.769
You got
anything sharp in your --

00:55.803 --> 00:56.737
no.

00:58.373 --> 01:00.374
Hey, hey.

01:00.408 --> 01:01.675
Hey, where were you guys
when I was getting robbed? Huh?

01:01.709 --> 01:02.709
You fight with him?

01:02.744 --> 01:04.077
Is that where the blood
came from?

01:04.111 --> 01:05.879
Yeah. But it didn't
stop him, though.

01:05.914 --> 01:08.215
He took everything I had.
He took everything.

01:11.085 --> 01:12.052
Not <i>everything.</i>

01:19.894 --> 01:21.261
That guy's out there
with a knife,

01:21.296 --> 01:22.663
and you're gonna
arrest <i>me?</i>

01:22.697 --> 01:23.797
Since you don't have
any I.D.,

01:23.831 --> 01:25.098
you want to give us
a name, please?

01:25.133 --> 01:27.901
Yeah, Pedro Street.

01:30.905 --> 01:32.139
Well, Mr. street,

01:32.173 --> 01:33.574
you're under arrest for
possession of rock cocaine.

01:33.608 --> 01:34.975
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:35.009 --> 01:36.677
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

01:36.711 --> 01:37.678
in a court of law.

01:37.712 --> 01:38.712
You give up that right,

01:38.746 --> 01:40.047
you have the right
to an attorney.

01:40.081 --> 01:41.448
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

01:41.482 --> 01:42.683
one will be provided
for you.

02:06.074 --> 02:07.841
We need to
strip search you.

02:07.875 --> 02:09.142
Empty your pockets.

02:09.176 --> 02:10.443
Put everything
in this container.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.145
Then remove your clothes,
and turn around, please.

02:18.119 --> 02:20.354
<i>Everything</i>
<i>from your pockets.</i>

02:20.388 --> 02:21.888
That <i>is</i> everything.

02:21.923 --> 02:23.557
What about your car keys?

02:23.591 --> 02:25.559
What car keys?

02:51.252 --> 02:53.620
The guy was smoking crack
on skid row.

02:53.655 --> 02:54.788
Had blood on his shirt.

02:54.822 --> 02:55.956
Gave us a fake name,

02:55.990 --> 02:57.958
then threw away his keys
on the way to booking.

03:01.162 --> 03:03.263
He threw away the keys.

03:03.298 --> 03:04.765
We know
his real name yet?

03:04.799 --> 03:06.433
Thomas Arthur Gavin.

03:06.467 --> 03:08.368
The third.

03:08.403 --> 03:09.736
Aka "Trey."

03:09.771 --> 03:10.737
No criminal history.

03:10.772 --> 03:12.506
Until today.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.241
But he does have...

03:14.275 --> 03:15.409
M-number fingerprints
on file.

03:15.443 --> 03:16.576
And they're attached
to his real-estate

03:16.611 --> 03:18.278
and investment-broker
licenses.

03:18.313 --> 03:21.181
So, what am I investigating him
<i>for,</i> Commander?

03:21.215 --> 03:23.450
Smoking crack
without the right answers?

03:23.484 --> 03:25.085
Look, Chief Delk
has made it very clear.

03:25.119 --> 03:28.288
He doesn't want
specialized units

03:28.323 --> 03:29.923
like Major Crimes
just sitting around.

03:29.957 --> 03:31.591
Unless there's a victim
I don't know about,

03:31.626 --> 03:32.926
you've already made
your arrest.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.028
Yeah, but, Chief,
you got to admit --

03:35.063 --> 03:36.196
it's suspicious --

03:36.230 --> 03:38.498
a crackhead throwing away
the key to a Mercedes?

03:38.533 --> 03:41.601
Ohh...

03:42.704 --> 03:43.937
Okay.

03:43.971 --> 03:46.206
What other information
do we have on our drug user?

03:46.240 --> 03:49.343
Well, uh,
Thomas Arthur Gavin III

03:49.377 --> 03:50.744
graduated from USC.

03:50.778 --> 03:52.879
And then he went on
to UCLA,

03:52.914 --> 03:54.715
where he received
an M.B.A.

03:54.749 --> 03:56.917
Not someone you expect
to find on skid row.

03:56.951 --> 03:58.752
Yeah, but, you know,
he defaulted on his credit cards

03:58.786 --> 04:00.520
after maxing them out,

04:00.555 --> 04:02.656
and earlier this year,
he lost his house.

04:03.825 --> 04:05.192
Does he own
a Mercedes?

04:05.226 --> 04:06.560
He does not own a car
at all.

04:06.594 --> 04:07.861
The bank
repossessed his BMW

04:07.895 --> 04:10.731
after the payments lapsed
eight months ago.

04:10.765 --> 04:14.868
Okay, so, how does
a college-educated broker

04:14.902 --> 04:18.672
who used to own a house
and a BMW end up on skid row?

04:18.706 --> 04:20.440
Addiction doesn't
discriminate, Chief.

04:20.475 --> 04:21.975
Park Avenue
to park bench.

04:22.009 --> 04:23.443
It can happen to anyone.

04:23.478 --> 04:25.412
Yes, but addiction
isn't a crime, Lieutenant.

04:31.386 --> 04:32.619
Okay...

04:32.653 --> 04:34.454
Lieutenant Provenza,
could you please...

04:34.489 --> 04:36.656
I got it.
Thank you very much.

04:36.691 --> 04:38.658
...Go to a
Mercedes-Benz dealer,

04:38.693 --> 04:40.827
have 20 copies
of this key made,

04:40.862 --> 04:43.063
organize a grid search
where Mr. Gavin was picked up?

04:43.097 --> 04:44.765
See if, uh,
we can locate this vehicle.

04:46.067 --> 04:47.434
Babysitting
20 patrol officers

04:47.468 --> 04:49.236
running around
hitting the panic button --

04:49.270 --> 04:50.303
my kind of day.
Yeah.

04:50.338 --> 04:51.304
Thanks a <i>lot,</i> Chief.

04:51.339 --> 04:52.773
Well,
you are very welcome.

04:52.807 --> 04:54.574
Lieutenant Tao,
Detective Sanchez,

04:54.609 --> 04:56.410
would y'all please check
with missing persons,

04:56.444 --> 04:58.412
see if there is a report

04:58.446 --> 05:00.247
with a Mercedes attached to it?
You got it, Chief.

05:00.281 --> 05:01.848
It will take
a couple of days,

05:01.883 --> 05:03.683
but do you want me to get the blood
on the shirt analyzed for DNA?

05:03.718 --> 05:05.318
Yes, I do.
Thank you.

05:05.353 --> 05:07.354
Uh, so...

05:07.388 --> 05:08.989
Mr. Gavin --
where did you put him?

05:09.023 --> 05:11.625
Interview room 1.

05:11.659 --> 05:12.859
Guy's coming down
from crack, Chief.

05:12.894 --> 05:14.294
Has a tough road ahead.

05:14.328 --> 05:16.363
Well, maybe you can
help him out.

05:16.397 --> 05:18.064
So I'll find out
about the keys

05:18.099 --> 05:19.199
and bloody shirt.

05:19.233 --> 05:20.801
Detective Gabriel,
would you please listen in

05:20.835 --> 05:22.102
on my interview,

05:22.136 --> 05:24.304
follow up on our little
crackhead's story?

05:24.338 --> 05:26.339
Buzz, uh, earwiggy thing,
please?

05:26.374 --> 05:29.109
Thank you.

05:31.712 --> 05:32.779
Mr. Gavin.

05:32.814 --> 05:33.880
Good morning.

05:33.915 --> 05:35.715
I'm deputy Chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson.

05:37.218 --> 05:38.985
How are you feeling
this morning?

05:39.020 --> 05:40.153
Not good.

05:40.188 --> 05:43.156
Smoking crack
will do that to you.

05:44.392 --> 05:46.259
Mr. Gavin --
it's Trey.

05:46.294 --> 05:48.662
You can call me Trey.

05:50.465 --> 05:52.732
I'm sorry to ask,
but can I get...

05:52.767 --> 05:54.134
Can I get
some chocolate?

05:55.336 --> 05:57.304
You know, it helps me
when I'm like this.

05:57.338 --> 06:00.307
Sure, we'll have that
brought in for you right away.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.009
<i>And some more coffee,</i>
<i>too.</i>

06:03.044 --> 06:04.678
I guess that's me.

06:04.712 --> 06:05.912
Now I'm waiting
on crackheads.

06:05.947 --> 06:07.380
Excuse me.

06:07.415 --> 06:11.117
Since you're getting coffee
anyway, could you --
no.

06:11.152 --> 06:12.953
<i>But in the meantime...</i>

06:12.987 --> 06:14.488
I need to ask you
a few questions.

06:15.923 --> 06:17.524
Questions about what?

06:17.558 --> 06:18.625
About what happened
on skid row.

06:24.432 --> 06:26.266
I can't believe
I did it.

06:28.402 --> 06:30.537
Why'd I do it again,
huh?

06:30.571 --> 06:31.538
Why?

06:31.572 --> 06:32.672
Why'd you do <i>what?</i>

06:32.707 --> 06:33.773
Why'd I smoke again?

06:33.808 --> 06:35.475
I was doing so good.

06:35.510 --> 06:37.711
I worked so hard...

06:37.745 --> 06:39.813
To straighten myself out,
and now I'm --

06:39.847 --> 06:42.816
now I'm back not knowing
where I'm gonna sleep tonight.

06:42.850 --> 06:45.652
Oh, don't you worry about that.
We'll find a place for you.

06:45.686 --> 06:47.320
No, I need to go <i>home</i>
<i>to straighten it out.</i>

06:47.355 --> 06:49.523
Okay, but my parents --
they won't let me.

06:49.557 --> 06:50.891
Band I-I-I get it.

06:50.925 --> 06:52.492
I-I-I let them
down again,

06:52.527 --> 06:53.827
but...Those
people there --

06:53.861 --> 06:56.029
they were treating me
like I was a criminal,

06:56.063 --> 06:57.797
and I couldn't
stay there anymore.

06:57.832 --> 06:59.266
I-I-I just --
I <i>couldn't.</i>

06:59.300 --> 07:00.500
Stay where, Trey?

07:00.535 --> 07:02.135
The Credence
Recovery Center.

07:02.169 --> 07:03.670
It's some rehab,
you know?

07:03.704 --> 07:05.171
My parents --
they told me

07:05.206 --> 07:06.740
that if --
if I didn't stay there

07:06.774 --> 07:08.642
that they would never
talk to me again.

07:08.676 --> 07:10.143
But you should
see the way

07:10.177 --> 07:12.045
that they treat
these people there.

07:12.079 --> 07:13.580
You know,
they're yelling at me,

07:13.614 --> 07:14.881
and they're --

07:14.916 --> 07:16.516
they're calling me
worthless.

07:16.551 --> 07:18.418
Well, we're gonna call
that rehab right now,

07:18.452 --> 07:19.686
give 'em a talkin' to.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.888
<i>They're not doctors --</i>
<i>these people -- th're not.</i>

07:21.923 --> 07:23.723
They're -- they're --
they're con artists.

07:23.758 --> 07:25.559
<i>You know,</i>
<i>they take my dad's money,</i>

07:25.593 --> 07:27.561
<i>and then they act like</i>
<i>i work for them.</i>

07:27.595 --> 07:30.897
Detective Gabriel's checking
on Credence Recovery

07:30.932 --> 07:33.133
center now, Chief.
You know, and I tried to tell my parents.

07:33.167 --> 07:35.368
I said, "you're getting
ripped off," you know?

07:35.403 --> 07:37.404
But -- but they wouldn't
even come and visit me.

07:37.438 --> 07:38.672
Mm.

07:38.706 --> 07:41.308
Well, maybe I could talk
to your parents <i>for</i> you.

07:44.745 --> 07:47.213
Would you --

07:47.248 --> 07:48.248
would you, please?

07:48.282 --> 07:49.749
I would.

07:49.784 --> 07:52.485
Would you tell them that --
that I'm sorry, okay?

07:52.520 --> 07:54.187
And that I will get help
somewhere else?

07:54.221 --> 07:56.156
Maybe a hospital
or something.

07:56.190 --> 07:57.524
Okay.

07:57.558 --> 07:58.658
Okay.

07:58.693 --> 07:59.926
But first
you need to tell me

07:59.961 --> 08:01.928
about that
Mercedes key...

08:01.963 --> 08:02.996
And the blood
on your shirt.

08:03.030 --> 08:04.064
That police officer --

08:04.098 --> 08:05.865
he kept sticking those keys
in my face,

08:05.900 --> 08:08.268
and he kept saying that they were
mine, but they <i>weren't</i> mine.

08:08.302 --> 08:10.303
That police office smear blood
on your shirt, too?

08:11.939 --> 08:12.939
I know you had
those keys,

08:12.974 --> 08:14.874
'cause your fingerprints
were on them.

08:14.909 --> 08:18.712
We were able to get fingerprints
from the <i>keys?</i>

08:18.746 --> 08:20.380
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>i can't help you, Trey.</i>

08:20.414 --> 08:22.215
If all you're gonna do is lie to
me, then we are finished here.

08:22.249 --> 08:24.985
You need to decide --
do you want my help or not?

08:28.255 --> 08:29.623
Excuse me, Chief.

08:32.960 --> 08:33.994
Here.

08:34.028 --> 08:37.030
Chief, do you have
a second, please?

08:44.639 --> 08:46.306
I want you to think
about what I said, Trey.

08:46.340 --> 08:48.508
If I'm gonna help you
with your mom and dad,

08:48.542 --> 08:51.811
I need the truth
about what happened.

08:55.483 --> 08:56.750
What is it?

08:56.784 --> 08:59.319
Chief, so, Trey was
at Credence Recovery Center

08:59.353 --> 09:00.453
for three weeks.

09:00.488 --> 09:02.188
Now, his parents --
they paid the bill.

09:02.223 --> 09:04.024
<i>But</i> his stay
wasn't court-ordered,

09:04.058 --> 09:05.692
so he could leave
whenever he wanted,

09:05.726 --> 09:07.861
which he did last night
at about 10:00 p.m.

09:07.895 --> 09:10.463
Okay. So he's telling the truth
about <i>that</i> much.

09:10.498 --> 09:14.000
What about this, uh,
Recovery Center?

09:14.035 --> 09:15.935
They're known
for their tough-love approach,

09:15.970 --> 09:17.637
but it's <i>not</i> a con.

09:17.672 --> 09:21.007
Okay. Let me finish up
with the rest of Trey's story.

09:21.042 --> 09:22.609
Let's see
where it leads us.

09:27.048 --> 09:28.448
I thought about
what you said.

09:29.550 --> 09:30.884
If I tell you
everything,

09:30.918 --> 09:33.887
can you promise to --
to get my mom to talk to me?

09:33.921 --> 09:35.288
Yes, I will.

09:35.322 --> 09:36.956
I promise.

09:39.093 --> 09:40.727
Okay, because
when I tell you everything,

09:40.761 --> 09:42.028
I'm gonna <i>need</i>
<i>protection.</i>

09:42.063 --> 09:44.230
Protection from whom?

09:44.265 --> 09:46.499
There's this guy
on the streets --

09:46.534 --> 09:48.735
"Sarge" --
that's what he goes by.

09:48.769 --> 09:50.470
It's what
he calls himself.

09:50.504 --> 09:51.805
<i>He's the guy</i>
<i>that robbed me.</i>

09:51.839 --> 09:54.474
<i>He took everything</i>
<i>that I had.</i>

09:54.508 --> 09:56.142
He took my wallet.
He took my money.

09:56.177 --> 09:57.510
Trey,
when you were arrested,

09:57.545 --> 09:59.245
you had a bag of crack
in your pocket.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.847
That's because
when I buy the crack,

10:00.881 --> 10:02.015
I split it up, okay?

10:02.049 --> 10:03.883
And I-I put it in --
in different places

10:03.918 --> 10:05.552
in case something
like <i>that</i> happens to me,

10:05.586 --> 10:07.087
if I -- if I get robbed
by Sarge.

10:07.121 --> 10:08.822
He's done this before?
Rob you?

10:08.856 --> 10:09.856
Yes.

10:09.890 --> 10:10.857
"Sarge"?
Does he have another name?

10:10.891 --> 10:11.925
I don't -- I don't know.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.526
But he picks
on everybody, okay?

10:13.561 --> 10:14.661
It's not just me.

10:14.695 --> 10:15.729
He's got a knife,

10:15.763 --> 10:17.497
and he'll take everything
that you have.

10:17.531 --> 10:18.765
You know,
and the cops,

10:18.799 --> 10:19.899
they <i>know</i> about him,
right?

10:19.934 --> 10:21.000
But they just keep --

10:21.035 --> 10:22.502
they keep putting him
back out there!

10:22.536 --> 10:24.771
Chief, I'll speak
to the mounted unit,

10:24.805 --> 10:26.439
see if they know
this "Sarge."

10:26.474 --> 10:27.941
If he exists,
they'll bring him in.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.976
So when Sarge -- when
he came up to me this time,

10:30.010 --> 10:32.245
I decided I was gonna fight
back a little bit, you know?

10:32.279 --> 10:34.114
And when I made him bleed,

10:34.148 --> 10:35.115
he pulled out a knife.

10:35.149 --> 10:37.951
What about the keys?

10:37.985 --> 10:39.786
The keys fell out of his pocket when
we were fighting. He didn't notice.

10:39.820 --> 10:42.021
So I...

10:42.056 --> 10:43.356
I picked them up.

10:43.390 --> 10:45.291
You know, because I thought
maybe I'll <i>find</i> that car.

10:45.326 --> 10:48.261
Right? Maybe -- maybe
I'll take something from <i>him.</i>

10:48.295 --> 10:51.064
Maybe have a place
to sleep.

10:52.967 --> 10:55.535
I'm telling you --
if -- if he finds out

10:55.569 --> 10:57.103
that I told you
that he robbed me,

10:57.138 --> 10:58.404
he is gonna
come after me,

10:58.405 --> 10:59.572
seriously, okay?

10:59.607 --> 11:01.307
Now, don't you worry.

11:01.342 --> 11:03.076
We're gonna protect you
from Sarge. I promise.

11:06.547 --> 11:08.148
What now?

11:08.182 --> 11:09.883
Now, tell me where
you found the car.

11:09.917 --> 11:12.452
I didn't have time
to look.

11:14.188 --> 11:17.056
I got high.

11:17.091 --> 11:19.893
Then I got arrested.

11:19.927 --> 11:23.897
Chief Johnson, can
I speak to you for a moment?

11:27.935 --> 11:29.869
Chief...

11:29.904 --> 11:31.104
Lieutenant Tao and I
ran a batch

11:31.138 --> 11:33.373
for stolen Mercedes
reported between 8:00 p.m.

11:33.407 --> 11:34.841
And 6:00 a.m.
this morning.

11:34.875 --> 11:36.009
We only got one hit.

11:36.043 --> 11:38.344
A Kevin Adams
in Studio City

11:38.379 --> 11:39.612
reported
his vehicle missing

11:39.647 --> 11:41.181
around 4:00 a.m.
this morning.

11:41.215 --> 11:43.950
Okay, how do we know it's <i>his</i>
Mercedes we have the keys to?

11:43.984 --> 11:45.385
Well, Lieutenant Tao
is at his house right now,

11:45.419 --> 11:47.987
and Mr. Adams' set of keys
matches exactly the set of keys

11:48.022 --> 11:49.455
that Trey had
in his pocket.

11:49.490 --> 11:52.025
Where's Mr. Adams now?

11:52.059 --> 11:53.459
Tao's driving him in.

11:53.494 --> 11:55.428
Okay. But there's
something else, Chief.

11:56.831 --> 12:00.333
Meet Kimberly Anne Adams.

12:01.836 --> 12:03.136
She borrowed
his father's Mercedes

12:03.170 --> 12:04.704
last night
around 7:30 p.m.

12:04.738 --> 12:06.072
Never came home.

12:06.106 --> 12:09.442
So we're not just looking
for a stolen car anymore.

12:20.379 --> 12:23.181
Okay, Kimberly Adams.
Age 22.

12:23.216 --> 12:25.450
Buzz, would you please see to it
that Lieutenant Provenza

12:25.485 --> 12:26.852
gets a copy
of this photograph

12:26.886 --> 12:28.854
and the license plate
from the missing Mercedes?

12:28.888 --> 12:30.388
He's gonna need that
for his search.

12:30.423 --> 12:31.556
Yes, ma'am.

12:31.591 --> 12:33.825
Okay, so what do we know,
gentlemen?

12:33.860 --> 12:35.594
Miss Adams was a fourth-year
Pepperdine University student

12:35.628 --> 12:36.795
living at home --
no criminal record.

12:36.829 --> 12:37.996
Okay. Detective?

12:38.030 --> 12:39.965
Yeah, Chief,
I ran miss Adams' financials,

12:39.999 --> 12:42.033
and the only activity
in the last 72 hours

12:42.068 --> 12:45.237
is an atm withdrawal in
Hollywood last night for $100,

12:45.271 --> 12:47.873
which is her student account's
daily limit.

12:47.907 --> 12:50.675
Okay, Chief,
I got the file on Sarge,

12:50.710 --> 12:53.745
the guy that Trey Gavin
claims robbed him.

12:53.779 --> 12:55.013
Yeah, aka Edward Cain.

12:55.047 --> 12:57.115
Dishonorably discharged
from the army.

12:57.150 --> 13:00.552
He lives in an S.R.O. downtown
off of sixth,

13:00.586 --> 13:01.686
and he has
nine prior arrests

13:01.721 --> 13:03.155
for robbing the crackheads
of skid row.

13:03.189 --> 13:05.423
Chief, if he's been arrested
nine times,

13:05.458 --> 13:07.659
it means Sarge probably robs
people down there every day.

13:07.693 --> 13:08.760
The D.A. never pressed charges?

13:08.794 --> 13:11.062
The victims disappear --
too high, too drunk.

13:11.097 --> 13:13.265
Or they move
to a new cardboard box.

13:13.299 --> 13:15.767
Listen, our mounties say
they can find the guy easy.

13:15.801 --> 13:17.502
Do you want him here?
Yes, please. Detective Sanchez,

13:17.537 --> 13:20.906
would you please assist the mounted
unit in picking up Mr. Cain?

13:20.940 --> 13:22.874
But without a fight,
please.

13:22.909 --> 13:24.776
If there's wounds on him, I want to
make sure they're from last night.

13:24.810 --> 13:26.945
Sure, Chief.
I'll play nice.

13:26.979 --> 13:28.747
Thank you.
Chief Johnson,

13:28.781 --> 13:29.781
Lieutenant Provenza
with an update.

13:31.484 --> 13:33.251
Lieutenant, please tell me
you found something.

13:33.286 --> 13:36.121
Well, we've been searching for
the Mercedes all morning, Chief,

13:36.155 --> 13:39.124
and the one thing I can tell you
for sure is where it <i>isn't.</i>

13:39.158 --> 13:40.525
But, I, uh...

13:40.560 --> 13:42.260
I do have the photo
you sent over.

13:42.295 --> 13:43.795
Yes. Kimberly Adams.

13:43.829 --> 13:45.096
You're looking
for her father's car,

13:45.131 --> 13:46.164
but she was driving it
last night,

13:46.199 --> 13:47.566
so now you're looking
for her, too.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.735
So, officially,

13:50.770 --> 13:54.606
this is...Now more
than just a missing vehicle.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.975
We are treating it
as a carjacking at the moment,

13:57.009 --> 13:58.443
but while
you're out there looking,

13:58.477 --> 14:00.078
why don't you ask...

14:00.112 --> 14:01.580
Why don't you ask people
if they...

14:01.614 --> 14:02.714
Have seen
the young woman

14:02.748 --> 14:04.416
in the vicinity?

14:04.450 --> 14:06.051
Keep me posted.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.788
Marcus?

14:09.822 --> 14:12.557
Uh, we need to triple
the personnel on the grid.

14:12.592 --> 14:15.160
And you make sure every officer
on patrol out there

14:15.194 --> 14:18.029
has a picture of this girl
in their hands.

14:28.841 --> 14:30.609
Chief, this is
Mr. Kevin Adams.

14:30.643 --> 14:32.277
It's his Mercedes
we're looking for.

14:32.311 --> 14:33.578
And the only reason...

14:33.613 --> 14:35.247
That I reported it stolen

14:35.281 --> 14:37.148
is because you folks
told me

14:37.183 --> 14:38.750
that I had to wait
72 hours

14:38.784 --> 14:41.620
before my daughter could be
considered legally missing.

14:41.654 --> 14:44.689
Now, the police will search
for my car,

14:44.724 --> 14:46.591
but they won't search
for my little girl.

14:46.626 --> 14:48.026
Why aren't you looking
for her?

14:48.060 --> 14:49.027
We <i>are,</i> Mr. Adams.

14:49.061 --> 14:50.228
We're searching for her
right now,

14:50.263 --> 14:51.429
but we need your help.

14:55.001 --> 14:56.134
Well,
I brought some pictures

14:56.168 --> 14:57.469
from our trip
to Big Bear.

14:57.503 --> 14:58.937
Got her passport

14:58.971 --> 15:00.705
and birth certificate -- I don't
know what you folks need.

15:00.740 --> 15:02.274
Okay. Thank you.

15:02.308 --> 15:04.309
Sir?

15:04.343 --> 15:05.644
Please.

15:07.079 --> 15:09.314
Do you know where your daughter
was going last night?

15:09.348 --> 15:10.849
What part of town?

15:10.883 --> 15:11.916
No.

15:11.951 --> 15:13.385
Just out.
She was going out.

15:13.419 --> 15:14.819
Do you remember what
your daughter was wearing?

15:14.854 --> 15:15.987
A dress.

15:16.022 --> 15:17.422
I've been trying to remember
the color --

15:17.456 --> 15:18.790
blue, black --
I-I-I don't know.

15:18.824 --> 15:21.126
How about any
distinguishing mar?

15:21.160 --> 15:22.794
Scars, tattoos?

15:22.828 --> 15:24.062
No tattoos.

15:25.131 --> 15:26.731
She has, a, uh,

15:26.766 --> 15:28.466
a scar from an appendectomy
when she was 15.

15:28.501 --> 15:29.701
It's very small.

15:29.735 --> 15:31.436
Was she with anyone --
a boyfriend,

15:31.470 --> 15:32.937
someone from school,
perhaps?

15:32.972 --> 15:35.307
No, not when she left
the house, no.

15:35.341 --> 15:36.441
Was she meeting up
with anyone?

15:36.475 --> 15:38.977
I didn't ask.

15:40.146 --> 15:42.714
I didn't ask. I...

15:43.949 --> 15:45.717
Look, she's --
she's 22.

15:45.751 --> 15:46.818
I mean, I can't follow her
out the door

15:46.852 --> 15:48.286
every time she leaves.

15:49.655 --> 15:50.955
It was just
a normal night.

15:52.425 --> 15:53.792
She asked me
if she could use the car

15:53.826 --> 15:55.760
like she always does,
and...

15:55.795 --> 15:57.629
I asked her
if she needed some money

15:57.663 --> 15:58.930
like I always do.

15:59.999 --> 16:01.399
She said she'd be okay.

16:01.434 --> 16:03.835
Prob--

16:03.869 --> 16:05.136
probably 'cause she, uh,

16:05.171 --> 16:07.205
she has one of
my credit cards on her.

16:07.239 --> 16:10.041
What credit card
is that sir?

16:10.076 --> 16:11.710
Well, the American express
was in the name "K. Adams."

16:11.744 --> 16:14.045
Kim and her father
have the same first initial.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.313
Even if someone
asked her for I.D.,

16:15.348 --> 16:16.481
she'd still be able
to use it.

16:16.515 --> 16:18.550
So what did you guys find?
Okay.

16:18.584 --> 16:19.784
So...

16:19.819 --> 16:23.588
About four hours
after the $100 atm withdrawal,

16:23.622 --> 16:25.457
there was a transaction
on the AMEX

16:25.491 --> 16:27.959
for $114 at a club
in Hollywood

16:27.993 --> 16:29.861
called "purple"
for eight lemon drop martinis.

16:29.895 --> 16:32.897
That's $14.25 a drink.

16:32.932 --> 16:34.366
How do you do that
so fast?

16:34.400 --> 16:37.035
Eight drinks
for a girl her size?

16:37.069 --> 16:38.903
That might explain
why she never made it home.

16:38.938 --> 16:40.405
I don't think
they were all for her.

16:40.439 --> 16:43.074
The bar records say she bought
the drinks <i>two</i> at a time.

16:43.109 --> 16:44.576
Okay.

16:44.610 --> 16:47.379
So Kim was drunk,
maybe...

16:47.413 --> 16:49.047
But that Hollywood nightclub

16:49.081 --> 16:51.249
is awfully far away
from skid row.

16:51.283 --> 16:54.619
Yeah, far
from skid row, maybe,

16:54.653 --> 16:56.888
but not far
from Credence Recovery Center,

16:56.922 --> 16:58.022
Trey's rehab.

16:58.057 --> 17:00.091
What?

17:00.126 --> 17:01.326
It's about four Miles.

17:01.360 --> 17:02.994
That's an awfully
long walk.

17:03.028 --> 17:04.996
This is bullshit!

17:05.030 --> 17:06.030
Where do you
want him, Chief?

17:06.065 --> 17:07.665
This is police brutality!

17:07.700 --> 17:08.665
You hear me?!

17:08.701 --> 17:09.701
Interview room 2.

17:09.734 --> 17:11.269
Shut the hell up!
You listen to me!

17:11.303 --> 17:12.569
Pigs!

17:12.605 --> 17:14.339
Yeah, we heard you
the entire way here!

17:14.373 --> 17:15.906
You're strip searching
veterans! Pigs!

17:15.941 --> 17:18.910
Detective Sanchez, I said,
"do not fight with Sarge."
I told him that.

17:18.944 --> 17:20.678
So what happened?
He wouldn't listen.

17:20.713 --> 17:22.814
Chief, it's just pepper spray.
He'll live.

17:24.784 --> 17:26.417
We didn't find
any recent wounds

17:26.452 --> 17:27.919
on Sarge's body, Chief,

17:27.953 --> 17:29.587
but...

17:29.622 --> 17:32.290
...This is the stuff
he had in his pockets.

17:32.324 --> 17:33.425
Ah, a stiletto.

17:33.459 --> 17:34.526
That's never good.

17:34.560 --> 17:35.527
Trey's wallet.

17:35.561 --> 17:36.694
So Sarge <i>did</i> rob him.

17:36.729 --> 17:38.730
He was telling the truth
about <i>that.</i>

17:39.698 --> 17:42.133
Trey has no
criminal record.

17:42.168 --> 17:44.969
So, Chief, why did he ditch
the keys to the Mercedes?

17:45.004 --> 17:46.404
Why would he ditch
the keys?

17:46.439 --> 17:48.072
If a murderer was on his way
to booking

17:48.107 --> 17:49.674
and he did that,
what would you think?

17:49.708 --> 17:51.576
I would think I really
needed to find that car,

17:51.610 --> 17:53.478
and we're looking for it.
Chief...

17:53.512 --> 17:55.180
There is a <i>girl</i>
<i>who is missing</i>

17:55.214 --> 17:56.781
who may still be alive,

17:56.816 --> 17:58.116
and frankly, I think
it might be better --

17:58.150 --> 17:59.651
you think I should go
and <i>ask</i> Trey

17:59.685 --> 18:01.286
if he kidnapped Kim Adams

18:01.320 --> 18:02.821
or murdered her?

18:02.855 --> 18:04.823
He'd invoke his rights faster
than he fell off the wagon,

18:04.857 --> 18:07.192
and I'd never get to ask
about that girl.

18:07.226 --> 18:08.593
Now, Trey gave us
a good reason

18:08.627 --> 18:09.727
for throwing away
those keys.

18:09.762 --> 18:11.029
Before I ask him
any more questions,

18:11.063 --> 18:12.397
I need to know
the answers.

18:12.431 --> 18:14.032
Now I'm gonna go interview
this Sarge person.

18:14.066 --> 18:15.133
Do you mind?

18:35.187 --> 18:39.123
Yes, this is Detective
David Gabriel, Major Crimes.

18:39.158 --> 18:40.758
May I speak to Chief pope,
please?

18:48.931 --> 18:50.165
Mr. Cain, my name is --

18:50.199 --> 18:51.266
I don't care
<i>what</i> your name is!

18:51.300 --> 18:53.735
I'm Sarge,
and this is bullshit!

18:53.769 --> 18:55.336
Settle down, Cain.

18:55.371 --> 18:56.471
<i>You</i> settle down, man!

18:56.505 --> 18:57.672
You ever been
pepper sprayed in the face?!

18:57.707 --> 18:59.040
Uh-huh. You want more,
I have more.

18:59.075 --> 19:00.341
We'll spray you again,
no problem.

19:00.376 --> 19:01.342
As I was saying...

19:01.377 --> 19:03.311
<i>Mr. Cain, my name is</i>

19:03.345 --> 19:04.479
<i>Deputy Chief</i>
<i>Brenda Leigh Johnson.</i>

19:04.513 --> 19:05.714
<i>You've met</i>
<i>Detective Sanchez here.</i>

19:05.748 --> 19:07.182
<i>We've got a few questions</i>
<i>for you.</i>

19:07.216 --> 19:08.483
<i>...The right</i>
<i>to remain silent.</i>

19:08.517 --> 19:10.218
<i>Anything you say</i>
<i>can and will</i>

19:10.252 --> 19:12.353
<i>be used against you</i>
<i>in a court of law.</i>

19:12.388 --> 19:13.688
<i>You have the right to speak</i>
<i>to an attorney...</i>

19:13.723 --> 19:15.256
I take it these are
the two suspects in the case

19:15.291 --> 19:17.559
you're worried about, Detective?
Yes, sir.

19:17.593 --> 19:19.594
<i>Do you understand these rights</i>
<i>as they have been read to you?</i>

19:19.628 --> 19:20.995
All right, well,

19:21.030 --> 19:22.597
before, uh, we talk
about your concerns,

19:22.631 --> 19:24.232
I'd like to know
why a set

19:24.266 --> 19:26.601
of lost car keys escalated
into a tactical alert.

19:26.635 --> 19:29.270
Why is all of central bureau
out looking for a missing car

19:29.305 --> 19:32.574
and a girl who may very well
just be hung over somewhere?

19:32.608 --> 19:34.943
Oh, you know...
A hunch.

19:34.977 --> 19:38.146
Well, I'm not <i>sure</i> that's gonna
be enough for Chief Delk.

19:38.180 --> 19:40.148
Why do you care
what Delk thinks?

19:40.182 --> 19:41.549
Because Chief Johnson
asked me

19:41.584 --> 19:43.218
to care about it.

19:43.252 --> 19:45.620
You know...

19:45.654 --> 19:47.288
It's a little early
for you

19:47.323 --> 19:48.590
to start acting like
I don't matter anymore.

19:48.624 --> 19:50.058
I mean,
you may be right.

19:50.092 --> 19:52.594
But then again,
you may be wrong.

19:52.628 --> 19:54.829
And while you're thinking about
that, why don't you explain to me

19:54.864 --> 19:57.665
why you brought what looks like
a crack case to Major Crimes?

19:57.700 --> 20:01.336
I just thought it was better
to look busy.

20:02.605 --> 20:03.738
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

20:03.773 --> 20:06.141
<i>Well, hey,</i>
<i>what do you want to know?</i>

20:09.178 --> 20:11.279
I mean,
why not ask a question

20:11.313 --> 20:13.381
instead of chasing me
through the street?

20:13.415 --> 20:14.916
Where'd you get
this wallet?

20:14.950 --> 20:16.117
I found that.
Where?

20:16.152 --> 20:17.185
Around!

20:17.219 --> 20:19.087
I don't know!
People drop things!

20:19.121 --> 20:21.189
<i>Especially when they're stoned</i>
<i>out of their minds...</i>

20:21.223 --> 20:23.825
<i>Like the smoker broker</i>
<i>usually is.</i>

20:23.859 --> 20:24.926
Excuse me?

20:24.960 --> 20:26.661
"Smoker broker."
Trey?

20:26.695 --> 20:30.265
So, what,
he call you guys? Huh?

20:30.299 --> 20:31.833
Tell you I stole
his wallet?

20:31.867 --> 20:33.735
<i>That bastard --</i>
<i>i didn't steal it.</i>

20:33.769 --> 20:35.203
<i>I found it,</i>
<i>just like I said.</i>

20:35.237 --> 20:36.838
So this guy's
just pretty much confirmed

20:36.872 --> 20:37.839
what the other guy said.

20:37.873 --> 20:38.973
What is it about

20:39.008 --> 20:41.009
this, uh, Trey kid
that makes him seem like

20:41.043 --> 20:42.811
some kind of super criminal
to you?

20:42.845 --> 20:44.679
Chief, it's the keys.

20:44.713 --> 20:46.447
Okay? I can't get my head
around it.

20:46.482 --> 20:48.983
I don't understand why
he would throw the keys away

20:49.018 --> 20:50.485
if he didn't think they would
get him in trouble.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.054
<i>Mr. Cain...</i>

20:53.088 --> 20:54.989
<i>Your criminal record shows</i>
<i>nine arrests for robbery --</i>

20:55.024 --> 20:56.324
<i>all</i> of them on skid row.

20:56.358 --> 20:58.860
You take advantage
of people there, don't you?

20:58.894 --> 21:01.162
Arrests
aren't convictions,

21:01.197 --> 21:03.865
so I don't <i>have</i>
<i>a criminal record.</i>

21:03.899 --> 21:04.899
I have a record
as a veteran

21:04.934 --> 21:05.900
of the United States
Armed Forces,

21:05.935 --> 21:07.202
where I learned

21:07.236 --> 21:08.570
what it takes
to survive.

21:08.604 --> 21:11.372
Is that why
you carry <i>this?</i>

21:12.741 --> 21:13.541
To survive?

21:13.576 --> 21:14.843
There's nothing illegal

21:14.877 --> 21:17.345
about wanting to protect myself,
is there?

21:17.379 --> 21:19.514
Possession of a weapon with a
double-edged blade over 4 inches

21:19.548 --> 21:21.716
is a felony --
two years in prison.

21:21.750 --> 21:22.884
Wonder if there's blood
on it.

21:26.455 --> 21:29.490
Look, that knife belonged
to the smoker broker, okay?

21:29.525 --> 21:31.759
I took it from him
to sell it.

21:31.794 --> 21:32.894
So you admit
to robbing Trey?

21:32.928 --> 21:34.395
Okay.

21:35.531 --> 21:36.831
Yeah.

21:38.334 --> 21:39.767
The guy was
smoking hard, but...

21:39.802 --> 21:41.269
You know,
he surprised me,

21:41.303 --> 21:43.404
'cause...
Because he fought back?

21:45.174 --> 21:47.442
If you call crying like
a little girl while I shook him

21:47.476 --> 21:48.610
as fighting,

21:48.644 --> 21:50.278
<i>well, then, sure,</i>
<i>he fought back.</i>

21:56.652 --> 21:58.253
Hello?!

21:58.287 --> 22:00.054
<i>Please let me out!</i>

22:00.089 --> 22:01.756
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Please, let me out!</i>

22:01.790 --> 22:02.790
Is that all you got?

22:02.825 --> 22:04.292
Are we through?

22:04.326 --> 22:05.727
Not quite.

22:09.832 --> 22:11.099
Where'd you get this?

22:13.035 --> 22:14.936
You just put it
on the table.

22:14.970 --> 22:16.337
Answer the question!

22:16.372 --> 22:18.439
I don't think you realize
how much trouble you're in...

22:18.474 --> 22:19.240
<i>Sarge!</i>

22:19.275 --> 22:20.241
Come on!

22:20.276 --> 22:22.010
Please! Let me out!

22:25.014 --> 22:27.815
Hey. Look at Trey.

22:27.850 --> 22:29.951
What does he think
he's doing?

22:35.858 --> 22:37.625
What the hell?!

22:38.627 --> 22:39.761
Get your ass over here!

22:39.795 --> 22:41.062
Get over here!
No.

22:41.096 --> 22:43.164
Get up against the wall!
Don't hurt me!

22:43.198 --> 22:44.766
Hands behind your back!
Don't hurt me, please! Please!

22:44.800 --> 22:46.634
You got him?
Just let me go, please?

22:46.669 --> 22:48.336
Jail time for a knife
is <i>nothing</i>

22:48.370 --> 22:50.305
compared to stealing
a Mercedes.

22:50.339 --> 22:52.040
Well, that's just a lie,
and you know it.

22:54.610 --> 22:56.744
No one ever goes to prison in
California for stealing a car.

22:56.779 --> 22:58.112
They do for carjacking.

22:58.147 --> 23:00.148
Trey said these fell out of
your pocket when you robbed him.

23:00.182 --> 23:01.649
So <i>where</i> is that car,
Mr. Cain,

23:01.684 --> 23:03.885
and <i>where</i> is the young woman
who was driving it?!

23:06.822 --> 23:08.089
Chief Johnson,

23:08.123 --> 23:09.524
we have a problem.

23:12.561 --> 23:14.095
What happened?

23:14.129 --> 23:15.863
Our smoker broker
had a little anxiety attack.
Ohh.

23:15.898 --> 23:16.798
Oh -- Trey!

23:16.832 --> 23:18.132
You said
that you would be

23:18.167 --> 23:19.867
right outside that door.

23:19.902 --> 23:22.303
And you locked me in here, and then
you left me, and you never came back!

23:22.338 --> 23:24.505
Trey, you have to understand -- why are
you treating me like I'm a criminal?!

23:24.540 --> 23:26.841
Because you <i>are</i>
<i>a criminal!</i>

23:26.875 --> 23:29.210
You were caught smoking crack on a
public street this morning...
Okay, okay!

23:29.244 --> 23:31.279
...With blood on your shirt!
All right, all right. Detective.

23:33.549 --> 23:35.717
You need to understand

23:35.751 --> 23:36.884
I'm doing everything I can
to help you, Trey,

23:36.919 --> 23:38.886
but you have to cooperate.

23:38.921 --> 23:41.089
How are you
trying hard, huh?

23:41.123 --> 23:43.124
Did you even talk
to my parents?

23:43.158 --> 23:44.258
Yes, I have.

23:44.293 --> 23:45.893
That's part of
what's been holding me up.

23:45.928 --> 23:48.129
They --
they talked to you?

23:48.163 --> 23:49.297
Yes.

23:49.331 --> 23:51.366
Your mother's very upset
that you left rehab.

23:53.969 --> 23:55.703
She's only angry
because she doesn't know

23:55.738 --> 23:56.738
my side of it,
you know?

23:56.772 --> 23:58.339
If I could just
talk to her, please.

23:58.374 --> 23:59.640
I'm working on that, Trey,

23:59.675 --> 24:01.376
but you need to talk
to me first.

24:01.410 --> 24:02.744
Why?

24:02.778 --> 24:04.479
Because you had blood
all over your --

24:04.513 --> 24:06.247
I already told them it was
from my fight with Sarge!

24:06.281 --> 24:07.982
You know what? Sarge says
he didn't lay a hand on you.

24:08.017 --> 24:09.684
And when we strip searched him
like we did you,

24:09.718 --> 24:11.152
we didn't find a single cut,
a scrape, a bruise --

24:11.186 --> 24:12.420
all right, all right,
all right!

24:12.454 --> 24:13.788
That is a lie!
Detective, that is enough!

24:13.822 --> 24:15.289
That is a lie, and you know it.
Okay.

24:15.324 --> 24:17.091
I punched him
right in the face.

24:17.126 --> 24:18.559
I mean,
maybe it was the nose.

24:18.594 --> 24:20.395
You know, did you even check
to see if he had a bloody nose?

24:20.429 --> 24:22.563
He had a bloody nose.

24:22.598 --> 24:24.098
I know it was his blood,
all right?

24:24.133 --> 24:26.100
He used -- he used my shirt
to wipe off his face.

24:26.135 --> 24:27.268
Okay. Okay.

24:27.302 --> 24:28.269
Chief?

24:28.303 --> 24:29.404
Chief, Provenza.

24:30.706 --> 24:32.040
Yes, Lieutenant,
what is it?

24:32.074 --> 24:34.942
Chief,
I'm, uh, I'm in an alley

24:34.977 --> 24:37.178
about 10 minutes from where the
mounties picked up Trey Gavin.

24:37.212 --> 24:38.846
We found the Mercedes.

24:38.881 --> 24:40.081
And the girl?

24:41.884 --> 24:42.850
In the trunk.

24:42.885 --> 24:44.619
Ohh...

24:44.653 --> 24:45.820
And, Chief...

24:45.854 --> 24:50.291
<i>Somebody</i> was
very, <i>very</i> angry.

24:50.325 --> 24:53.928
Dr. Morales: Severely fractured
supraorbital area,

24:53.962 --> 24:56.631
causing
massive contusions.

24:56.665 --> 24:58.232
Left zygomatic arch...

24:58.267 --> 24:59.634
Shattered.

24:59.668 --> 25:01.736
Again, massive contusions.

25:01.770 --> 25:02.970
Nasal bone...

25:03.005 --> 25:04.639
All but destroyed.

25:04.673 --> 25:06.741
Massive contusions.

25:06.775 --> 25:07.875
Mandible fractured
in three places.

25:07.910 --> 25:09.544
So she was beaten
to death.

25:09.578 --> 25:10.478
No.

25:10.512 --> 25:13.314
She was also stabbed...

25:13.348 --> 25:15.516
18 times.

25:17.786 --> 25:21.322
The blood just trickled
out of her.

25:22.925 --> 25:25.326
Probably took about an hour
for her to die.

25:25.360 --> 25:29.464
Well, maybe she, uh,
she wasn't conscious.

25:29.498 --> 25:30.465
We can hope.

25:30.499 --> 25:32.400
What about
the murder weapon?

25:32.434 --> 25:34.836
Each of the stab wounds
has next to no tearing

25:34.870 --> 25:36.671
of the epidermis,
which leads me to believe

25:36.705 --> 25:38.406
that the knife
had a double-edged blade.

25:38.440 --> 25:39.841
Like a stiletto.

25:39.875 --> 25:41.742
A stiletto works.

25:41.777 --> 25:43.845
And, see here,
these rectangular bruises?

25:43.879 --> 25:47.315
They're caused by the top
of the knife's hilt,

25:47.349 --> 25:48.382
where the blade
meets the handle.

25:52.087 --> 25:53.588
4 1/2 inches.

25:53.622 --> 25:55.156
That's the length
of the blade.

25:55.190 --> 25:57.291
4 1/2-inch
double-edged blade.

25:57.326 --> 25:58.759
That sounds familiar.

26:01.029 --> 26:04.532
Okay, uh,
let's send off her...

26:04.566 --> 26:07.034
Blood to the lab --
if you could put a rush on it.

26:07.069 --> 26:08.336
Get it back by tomorrow.

26:12.841 --> 26:15.076
Hey, Mr. Adams said
that his daughter

26:15.110 --> 26:16.477
didn't have any tattoos.

26:16.512 --> 26:18.846
Well, maybe he didn't know
about it.

26:19.915 --> 26:21.349
Kim was buying drinks

26:21.383 --> 26:23.384
two at a time last night.

26:23.418 --> 26:26.621
He also said that, uh,
she had an appendectomy scar,

26:26.655 --> 26:27.755
a small one.

26:31.260 --> 26:34.362
No. No scar.

26:34.396 --> 26:35.997
Oh, my God.

26:36.031 --> 26:37.198
This is not Kim Adams.

26:42.145 --> 26:43.880
Sorry about the condition of her face.

26:44.892 --> 26:46.960
Tried to clean her up
as best we could.

26:48.930 --> 26:50.664
Her name's
Michelle Landale.

26:51.399 --> 26:53.667
She went to school
with Kim.

26:53.701 --> 26:55.635
I've known her
since she was 9.

27:00.808 --> 27:02.008
Oh, my God.
Her parents.

27:06.514 --> 27:08.515
Where did you say
you found her?

27:09.583 --> 27:13.353
Downtown, near skid row,
in the trunk of your Mercedes?

27:15.923 --> 27:17.891
And you're telling me
absolutely --

27:17.925 --> 27:21.394
absolutely that there is
no sign of Kim?

27:21.429 --> 27:23.964
No sign of your daughter.
No, sir.

27:27.535 --> 27:30.804
Oh, I don't know whether to be
more relieved by that

27:30.838 --> 27:31.972
or more worried.

27:33.841 --> 27:35.742
I hate to mention this,
but...

27:35.776 --> 27:37.811
The area in which we found
Michelle's body

27:37.845 --> 27:40.246
is known for crack
and heroin.

27:40.281 --> 27:42.983
And we were wondering if Kim
might have been --

27:43.017 --> 27:44.317
wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

27:44.352 --> 27:46.886
Are you suggesting that drugs
may be involved here?

27:46.921 --> 27:48.054
Possibly.

27:51.058 --> 27:53.226
And Kim had a lot to drink
last night.

27:59.400 --> 28:02.969
You're telling me
that Kim drove my car --

28:03.004 --> 28:04.771
<i>my</i> car to skid row.

28:04.805 --> 28:06.906
Unless you can think of
some other way it got there?

28:09.543 --> 28:11.544
Excuse me.

28:19.286 --> 28:22.589
Federal government involved
in this case now?

28:22.623 --> 28:24.791
Well, Pope called me, so...

28:24.825 --> 28:26.026
There could be.

28:26.060 --> 28:29.062
I've seen the evidence
you've collected.

28:29.096 --> 28:31.431
I think you might take
a closer look at Trey.

28:31.465 --> 28:32.832
Cain had
the murder weapon.

28:32.867 --> 28:34.134
Yeah, but he didn't
have any wounds on his body,

28:34.168 --> 28:36.036
so it couldn't have been
his blood on Trey's shirt,

28:36.070 --> 28:37.537
<i>and</i> Trey threw
the keys away.

28:37.571 --> 28:39.205
Now, why would he have done that
unless he knew what was in the car?

28:39.240 --> 28:40.540
Chief...

28:40.574 --> 28:43.076
I have known junkies
my entire life.

28:43.110 --> 28:45.545
They are all
incredible liars.

28:45.579 --> 28:48.114
Please, do <i>not</i> believe
this guy's story.

28:48.149 --> 28:49.916
It's ridiculous.

28:49.950 --> 28:51.251
All right,
hold on, Gabriel.

28:51.285 --> 28:53.353
Look, Chief...

28:53.387 --> 28:55.288
Normally, we would
just hold this kid

28:55.322 --> 28:57.624
until we could match the blood
on his shirt to the victim's

28:57.658 --> 28:58.992
and then call it a day.

28:59.026 --> 29:01.428
But there's another girl
out there -- somewhere --

29:01.462 --> 29:02.462
and if she's alive,

29:02.496 --> 29:04.531
we're running out of time
to find her.

29:06.901 --> 29:08.301
Come on, let's go.

29:11.839 --> 29:13.106
So what's the deal?

29:13.140 --> 29:15.608
What does it boil down to --
for you?

29:15.643 --> 29:18.111
I have questioned Trey very closely,

29:18.145 --> 29:20.013
and he's childish
and immature,

29:20.047 --> 29:22.482
but he's not capable
of stabbing a girl to death.

29:22.516 --> 29:24.984
Okay.

29:25.019 --> 29:27.087
You know that conversation
you <i>never</i> want to have?

29:27.121 --> 29:29.756
We've put it off
as long as we can.

29:37.765 --> 29:39.165
I am an alcoholic...

29:39.200 --> 29:41.000
Which means
I am an addict.

29:41.035 --> 29:42.168
Okay.
I know everything

29:42.203 --> 29:44.070
about this kind of stuff
I want to know.

29:44.105 --> 29:46.139
You think that,
but you don't -- really.

29:47.708 --> 29:49.742
Okay, and you might be making
a huge mistake,

29:49.777 --> 29:51.778
and there's a girl out there
whose life depends

29:51.812 --> 29:53.146
on you getting this right.
Okay?

29:54.849 --> 29:56.850
So look at me.

29:56.884 --> 29:58.585
Look at me and tell me.

29:58.619 --> 29:59.786
Am I a good guy?

29:59.820 --> 30:01.354
Do -- do you think...

30:01.388 --> 30:03.156
I'm a good guy?

30:03.190 --> 30:04.524
Of course I do.

30:04.558 --> 30:05.859
Okay, now, listen.

30:05.893 --> 30:08.628
Two days before I got
my second D.U.I.,

30:08.662 --> 30:10.029
I woke up hung over.

30:10.064 --> 30:11.865
I'm getting ready
for work,

30:11.899 --> 30:14.267
and I notice my jacket's
still on the couch,

30:14.301 --> 30:16.436
my keys are still
in the front door,

30:16.470 --> 30:18.471
and my gun is missing
three bullets.

30:18.506 --> 30:19.973
What?

30:20.007 --> 30:21.141
I go into the garage,

30:21.175 --> 30:23.009
I see I've shot up
the driver's side of my car.

30:23.043 --> 30:24.978
No one was hurt...

30:25.012 --> 30:27.347
But what if I had been
out on the town?

30:27.381 --> 30:29.048
What if I'd been
in a hotel?

30:29.083 --> 30:30.550
I could've killed someone.

30:30.584 --> 30:33.353
And here's the worst part
of it.

30:33.387 --> 30:34.687
I kept drinking...

30:34.722 --> 30:36.189
For two more days.

30:36.223 --> 30:39.526
Took me getting <i>another</i> D.U.I.
before I asked for help.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.661
But I only did that because
my career was on the line.

30:41.695 --> 30:45.365
That's how dangerous
<i>i</i> was.

30:47.067 --> 30:49.502
You're making it sound like
you're some kind of monster.

30:49.537 --> 30:51.571
And you're <i>not</i> a monster.

30:51.605 --> 30:53.873
You're the most
decent person I know.

30:55.509 --> 30:56.910
I'm both, honey.

30:56.944 --> 30:59.012
I'm sorry,

30:59.046 --> 31:01.581
but I'm both.

31:10.791 --> 31:12.492
Okay, Chief, so I ran

31:12.526 --> 31:14.861
Michelle Landale's
financials,

31:14.895 --> 31:17.197
and I found an atm withdrawal
a little before 1:00 a.m.

31:17.231 --> 31:18.932
On Central Avenue, skid row.
I contacted the bank.

31:18.966 --> 31:21.768
I had them e-mail me
the security footage.

31:21.802 --> 31:23.503
This is what they sent over.

31:23.537 --> 31:24.837
So, that's
Michelle Landale.

31:24.872 --> 31:26.039
There's the stiletto,

31:26.073 --> 31:27.674
and that's the Mercedes
in the background.

31:27.708 --> 31:30.210
And from the looks of it,

31:30.244 --> 31:31.644
our suspect is running out
of patience.

31:37.384 --> 31:39.252
She tried to save herself.

31:45.793 --> 31:47.760
Unsuccessfully.

31:47.795 --> 31:48.895
And he managed to do
all of that

31:48.929 --> 31:49.896
and still keep
his face hidden.

31:49.930 --> 31:51.531
I don't need to see it.

31:56.470 --> 31:58.438
Hey. Hey.

31:58.472 --> 32:00.039
You all right?

32:00.074 --> 32:01.608
I don't know.
I don't know.

32:01.642 --> 32:03.776
How did I get this
all so wrong?

32:03.811 --> 32:06.079
Because you're used
to siding with the victim.

32:06.113 --> 32:07.547
That's how addicts see
themselves when they're using.

32:07.581 --> 32:09.882
Nothing -- <i>nothing</i>
<i>is ever their fault.</i>

32:13.587 --> 32:15.221
Okay.

32:15.256 --> 32:17.624
I'll give him someone to blame
and see how <i>that</i> works.

32:26.233 --> 32:27.767
Thank you, Detective.

32:27.801 --> 32:29.068
I'll take over
from here.

32:29.103 --> 32:30.069
Are you sure, Chief?

32:30.104 --> 32:31.037
Yes.

32:40.881 --> 32:43.850
When you brought me back up
from holding,

32:43.884 --> 32:46.319
I kind of thought my parents
might be here.

32:46.353 --> 32:47.520
They're on their way.

32:47.554 --> 32:49.122
Really?
Mm-hmm.

32:49.156 --> 32:50.290
Are you sure?
Yeah.

32:50.324 --> 32:51.524
I've had some
pretty serious conversations

32:51.558 --> 32:52.859
with your mom and dad,

32:52.893 --> 32:54.327
and I think they're finally
ready to listen to you.

32:54.361 --> 32:57.330
Oh, my God.

32:57.364 --> 32:58.464
Thank you.

33:02.636 --> 33:04.404
Thank you.

33:04.438 --> 33:05.838
Thank you so much.

33:05.873 --> 33:10.109
I'm -- I'm sorry about
what I did to the other room.

33:10.144 --> 33:11.844
M-my dad will pay for it.

33:11.879 --> 33:15.515
I want you to know
that I'm...

33:15.549 --> 33:16.849
I'm better.

33:16.884 --> 33:18.618
You know,

33:18.652 --> 33:19.686
<i>i'm -- I'm much better.</i>

33:19.720 --> 33:21.120
<i>Well, good,</i>

33:21.155 --> 33:22.422
<i>'cause I was worried about you</i>
<i>there for a minute.</i>

33:23.991 --> 33:26.426
Now, all I need from you

33:26.460 --> 33:27.794
is to help me to sort out

33:27.828 --> 33:30.530
who's legally to blame
for what happened last night.

33:30.564 --> 33:33.366
To blame for what?

33:33.400 --> 33:34.867
Are you aware

33:34.902 --> 33:36.336
<i>that someone under</i>
<i>the influence of a narcotic</i>

33:36.370 --> 33:38.037
<i>is technically</i>
<i>not responsible</i>

33:38.072 --> 33:39.339
<i>for any crime</i>
<i>they commit,</i>

33:39.373 --> 33:41.074
<i>as long as they were</i>
<i>seeking treatment</i>

33:41.108 --> 33:42.141
<i>within a 12-hour window?</i>

33:42.176 --> 33:44.477
Really?
Mm-hmm.

33:44.511 --> 33:45.745
And since we can document

33:45.779 --> 33:47.880
that you were
at Credence Recovery Center

33:47.915 --> 33:49.716
nine hours before
we picked you up,

33:49.750 --> 33:51.050
we can't arrest you
for anything

33:51.085 --> 33:52.385
that happened
before 10:00 a.m.

33:52.419 --> 33:55.121
I-I wasn't --

33:55.155 --> 33:57.423
I wasn't in rehab
when I was arrested.

33:57.458 --> 33:58.991
That's 'cause
they let you out,

33:59.026 --> 34:00.193
which is also illegal

34:00.227 --> 34:02.228
considering
what they'd been paid.

34:02.262 --> 34:04.330
In fact, we're opening
an investigation

34:04.365 --> 34:06.065
into Credence
Recovery Center,

34:06.100 --> 34:07.800
because I think we're gonna have
to hold them accountable

34:07.835 --> 34:08.801
for what happened
last night.

34:08.835 --> 34:11.704
What are you
talking about?

34:11.739 --> 34:13.373
Look, Trey,
I understand why

34:13.407 --> 34:15.742
you didn't tell me
everything earlier.

34:15.775 --> 34:18.678
Probably don't remember
it all -- the state you were in.

34:18.712 --> 34:21.114
Or you were afraid
that you'd get into trouble.

34:21.148 --> 34:23.081
But you're not
in any trouble...Yet.

34:23.117 --> 34:25.650
Still,
I have to warn you...

34:25.686 --> 34:27.719
That since you're no longer
under the influence,

34:27.755 --> 34:29.155
that 12-hour window
has closed,

34:29.188 --> 34:30.822
and you are
now responsible

34:30.858 --> 34:32.992
for anything that happens
from this moment on.

34:33.025 --> 34:34.494
But you're still
gonna help me?

34:34.527 --> 34:37.764
I-I mean, you're gonna
let me talk to my parents?

34:37.797 --> 34:38.898
Provided you're honest
with me, yes.

34:40.134 --> 34:41.434
So the faster
we clear all this up --

34:41.467 --> 34:42.935
wait. Clear <i>what</i> up?

34:42.969 --> 34:44.170
The blood on your shirt,
Trey.

34:45.639 --> 34:47.407
We know it didn't belong
to Sarge.

34:55.983 --> 34:57.917
M-maybe it was mine.

34:59.052 --> 35:00.953
Maybe our fight was --

35:00.988 --> 35:03.122
you were strip searched, Trey.
You weren't bleeding.

35:03.157 --> 35:05.958
No.
We've matched the blood

35:05.993 --> 35:08.127
on your shirt to the body
of Michelle Landale.

35:08.162 --> 35:12.331
She was found dead in the trunk
of a Mercedes.

35:15.035 --> 35:16.769
Oh, God.

35:18.605 --> 35:20.072
And the key
to that Mercedes

35:20.107 --> 35:21.607
was the one that you threw out
of your pocket

35:21.642 --> 35:22.975
when you were arrested.

35:25.779 --> 35:26.979
Oh, God.

35:27.014 --> 35:29.215
<i>Now, listen to me, Trey.</i>
<i>Listen.</i>

35:29.249 --> 35:31.150
<i>All that happened</i>
<i>within the 12-hour window</i>

35:31.185 --> 35:32.752
I was telling you about.
You were high then.

35:32.786 --> 35:35.321
You had been seeking treatment.

35:35.355 --> 35:37.156
Michelle's death
is <i>not</i> your fault.

35:38.258 --> 35:39.759
Now, look at me, Trey.
Look at me.

35:39.793 --> 35:41.828
'Cause this is important.

35:41.862 --> 35:45.765
The driver of that Mercedes
is still missing.

35:45.799 --> 35:48.634
A-and you can help me
find her.

36:01.281 --> 36:03.916
I'm so sorry
for all of this.

36:03.951 --> 36:05.051
Don't you think
I know that?

36:05.085 --> 36:06.519
Why do you think
I've been helping you?

36:06.553 --> 36:09.021
But if anything happens
to that other girl --

36:09.056 --> 36:12.124
if she's alive, for example,
but hurt,

36:12.159 --> 36:14.026
and she died before we were
able to get to her,

36:14.061 --> 36:15.595
<i>you</i> would be responsible
for her death.

36:15.629 --> 36:17.530
That's why you have to
help me find her.

36:17.564 --> 36:19.999
Can you do that?

36:20.033 --> 36:22.702
Now, I've been
helping you.

36:22.736 --> 36:25.037
Can you help me?
Just a little?

36:28.075 --> 36:30.943
I'll -- I'll tell you
where she is.

36:45.238 --> 36:48.774
Kimberly, are you in there?!

37:15.936 --> 37:16.936
Paramedic!

37:38.091 --> 37:40.259
According to miss Adams,

37:40.293 --> 37:42.228
when she
and Michelle Landale

37:42.262 --> 37:43.529
left the nightclub,

37:43.563 --> 37:45.464
Trey stopped them
in the parking lot

37:45.499 --> 37:47.299
and asked for money.

37:47.334 --> 37:49.335
Miss Adams gave him
a few dollars.

37:49.369 --> 37:51.637
Miss Landale...Did not.

37:51.671 --> 37:53.472
Trey then pulled
a knife,

37:53.507 --> 37:57.977
which is the same knife
Cain stole from him later,

37:58.011 --> 38:00.479
and he forced the girls
to drive him downtown,

38:00.514 --> 38:05.217
where his plan was to use
their atm cards to get cash.

38:05.252 --> 38:07.253
But miss Adams had reached
her daily limit

38:07.287 --> 38:08.721
from earlier
in the evening.

38:08.755 --> 38:10.589
Right.

38:10.624 --> 38:12.057
So he was
gonna wait 24 hours

38:12.092 --> 38:13.993
and force her to withdraw
another $100.

38:14.027 --> 38:15.828
But Michelle Landale
and Kim Adams

38:15.862 --> 38:18.097
had the same type
of account.

38:18.131 --> 38:19.798
If Trey had kept
her alive,

38:19.833 --> 38:21.734
he could have had
twice the money.

38:21.768 --> 38:23.536
So why did he kill her?

38:23.570 --> 38:25.938
Because she...

38:25.972 --> 38:27.706
She ran.

38:27.741 --> 38:29.208
She tried to escape.

38:32.579 --> 38:33.746
And I lost it.

38:36.416 --> 38:39.251
I see.

38:39.286 --> 38:41.687
I mean, you know crack.
It just...

38:41.721 --> 38:44.023
It takes you
out of yourself.

38:46.159 --> 38:47.693
You know,
your judgment...

38:47.727 --> 38:50.262
It's part of the high.

38:50.297 --> 38:53.499
And not having to think
about right and wrong.

38:59.606 --> 39:01.640
This...

39:01.675 --> 39:02.775
This girl...

39:04.911 --> 39:06.512
M-Michelle --
is that her name?

39:12.219 --> 39:14.687
I didn't --
I didn't want to kill her.

39:14.721 --> 39:16.222
No, I...

39:16.256 --> 39:17.456
That's the drugs.

39:25.332 --> 39:26.665
You know,
I-I-I really hope

39:26.700 --> 39:27.967
that they stick it
to these people

39:28.001 --> 39:31.971
at the Credence
Recovery Center over this.

39:32.005 --> 39:34.707
Thank God I-I was
seeking treatment, right?

39:39.479 --> 39:41.780
A-are you mad me?

39:43.350 --> 39:46.719
'Cause I-I-I just helped you
like you wanted me to, you know?

39:46.753 --> 39:48.988
But now...

39:49.022 --> 39:50.289
God, you're staring
at me like...

39:52.492 --> 39:53.826
Hey, l-look at me.

39:53.860 --> 39:56.195
God, I'm -- I'm not
a bad person.

39:56.229 --> 39:57.296
You know that.

39:57.330 --> 40:00.132
I don't think
you're a bad person, Trey.

40:01.701 --> 40:04.169
I think
you're a monster.

40:04.204 --> 40:07.006
And you're under arrest
for murder in the first degree.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.008
What?

40:09.042 --> 40:10.576
Well, wait.

40:10.610 --> 40:13.012
Wait. You're still gonna help
me, though, right?

40:13.046 --> 40:15.381
You said that I wasn't
responsible for this.

40:15.415 --> 40:17.683
That's what you -- she said
I wasn't responsible for this!

40:17.717 --> 40:19.518
Isn't that what you said?

40:19.552 --> 40:20.619
You said
I'm not responsible.

40:20.654 --> 40:21.854
Wait, no -- hey!
No!

40:21.888 --> 40:25.024
No! Please!
It's not my fault! Please!

40:25.058 --> 40:27.926
Tell them
it's not my fault!

40:27.961 --> 40:29.595
You have to tell them
that it's not my fault!

40:29.629 --> 40:32.398
This isn't my fault! Please,
you have to tell them that!

40:32.432 --> 40:34.466
It's not my fault!
Please!

40:34.501 --> 40:35.567
Please, tell them!

40:35.602 --> 40:36.769
David...
No, please!

40:36.803 --> 40:38.203
...You went
over my head.

40:38.238 --> 40:39.938
Yes, I did.

40:39.973 --> 40:42.908
I'll try to make sure you never feel
the need to do <i>that</i> again.

40:42.942 --> 40:44.343
Chief...

40:44.377 --> 40:46.412
Look...

40:46.446 --> 40:50.282
I am <i>always</i>
<i>on your side.</i>

40:50.317 --> 40:53.152
You know that, right?

40:53.186 --> 40:55.120
I do.

40:55.155 --> 40:56.255
I know that.

41:07.801 --> 41:08.967
Hey.

41:09.002 --> 41:10.069
Hey.

41:10.103 --> 41:13.405
Do you have to leave
right away?

41:13.440 --> 41:14.840
I can stay for a while.

41:14.874 --> 41:16.208
You feel like talking?

41:16.242 --> 41:19.144
I do.

41:19.179 --> 41:21.313
Um, I know you had
this other life

41:21.348 --> 41:23.148
before you stopped
drinking.

41:23.183 --> 41:26.819
I-I don't like to think
about it, but...

41:28.288 --> 41:29.788
...Maybe I should.

41:32.726 --> 41:34.093
Okay.

41:41.301 --> 41:42.735
What would you like me
to tell you?

41:42.769 --> 41:45.070
Oh...

41:45.105 --> 41:48.073
Everything I don't want
to hear.
