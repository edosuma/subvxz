Good morning, Estelle.

-That's better. That's better.

[Hector] Morning, Mr. Edgecomb.

03:20.658 --> 03:21.951
Some Danish this morning?

03:22.035 --> 03:25.204
No, just two pieces of dry toast, Hector.
Thanks.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.873
Leftover's fine.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.666
Dry and cold, same as always.

03:29.417 --> 03:30.418
Cold is better.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.086
Hmm.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.880
Especially on those long walks.

03:35.506 --> 03:36.591
Am I right?

03:38.301 --> 03:41.221
Don't let Nurse Godzilla catch you.
She'll raise holy hell.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.848
You know we're not supposed
to let you wander off.

03:46.935 --> 03:50.939
Where do you go, every day?
What do you do up in those hills?

03:51.689 --> 03:53.024
Just walk.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.318
I like to walk.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.864
You try not to fall down, bust a hip.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.284
I don't wanna be in no damn search party.

<i>-I had six kids myself.</i>
-[all laughing]

05:26.659 --> 05:28.536
Why do we always watch this stuff?

05:29.412 --> 05:30.788
It's interesting.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.249
Interesting?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.585

No, I'm... I'm fine. I promise.
[chuckles]

06:09.827 --> 06:12.121
You're wearing yourself out
with those walks every day,

06:12.205 --> 06:13.664
that's what I think.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.625
Not that you asked me.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.336
I just didn't sleep well, is all.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.632
I had a few bad dreams. It happens. It...

06:23.424 --> 06:24.884
I'll be fine.

07:29.574 --> 07:30.783

[lightning cracking]

08:00.688 --> 08:04.150
I guess sometimes the past
just catches up with you

08:04.233 --> 08:07.111
whether you want it to or not. It's silly.

08:07.820 --> 08:11.115
Was it the film? It was, wasn't it?

08:12.533 --> 08:16.078
I haven't spoken of these things
for a long time, Ellie.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.372
Over 60 years.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.875
Paul, I'm your friend.

08:26.047 --> 08:30.092
I ever tell you that I was a prison guard
during the Depression?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.677
Uh, you've mentioned it.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.348
Did I mention that
I was in charge of death row,

08:35.431 --> 08:37.558
that I supervised all the executions?

08:42.188 --> 08:45.900
Usually, death row is called
"The Last Mile."

08:47.068 --> 08:49.403
We called ours "The Green Mile."

08:50.154 --> 08:52.823
The floor was the color of faded limes.

08:54.158 --> 08:56.160
We had the electric chair.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.955
"Old Sparky," we called it.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.084
Oh, I've lived a lot of years, Ellie.

09:03.167 --> 09:06.295
But, [clicks tongue] 1935,

09:06.379 --> 09:08.172
that takes the prize.

09:10.174 --> 09:12.134
That year, I had

09:12.218 --> 09:15.221
the worst urinary infection
of my life and...

09:17.306 --> 09:18.641
It was...

09:19.684 --> 09:21.727
It was also the year

09:22.520 --> 09:23.854
of John Coffey and

09:25.898 --> 09:27.775

Paul,

13:03.032 --> 13:06.160
you might wanna reconsider
getting in the cell with this guy.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.828
He's enormous.

Why don't you go see

14:58.105 --> 14:59.648
No. They got all the men they need.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.363
Oh, you can spell, can you?

Just my name, boss.

My name is Paul Edgecomb.

If I'm not here,
you can ask for Mr. Terwilliger,

16:42.334 --> 16:45.462
Mr. Howell or Mr. Stanton,
these gentlemen right there.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.174
Questions?

16:49.925 --> 16:52.261
Do you leave the light on after bedtime?

'Cause I get a little scared
in the dark sometime,

16:59.143 --> 17:01.103
if it's a strange place.

17:06.650 --> 17:09.862
It stays pretty bright
around here all night long.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.407
We always keep a few lights burning
out in the corridor.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.160
The corridor?

17:18.162 --> 17:19.455
Right out there.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.234
You can sit.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.162
[door locking]

18:11.590 --> 18:13.592
I couldn't help it, boss.

18:14.301 --> 18:17.304
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.853
Dean, pull Delacroix's card,

18:24.937 --> 18:27.439
take him down to the infirmary,
see if those fingers are broken.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.774
-Yes, sir.
-Of course they're broken.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.609
I heard the bones crack.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.654
Did you hear what he was yelling
when we brought the big dummy in?

18:33.737 --> 18:35.697
How could I miss it, Harry?
The whole prison heard.

18:36.657 --> 18:37.866
Goddamn Percy.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.453
You'll probably have to answer
for sending him off the Mile.

18:41.537 --> 18:44.289
Hmm. I'll chew that food when I have to.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.458
Right now I wanna hear
about this new inmate.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.085
Aside from how big he is, okay?

18:50.212 --> 18:52.089
Monstrous big. [chuckling] Damn.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.758
Oh, he seems meek enough.

-Is he retarded, you figure?
-Mmm-hmm.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.555
Looks like they sent us
an imbecile to execute.

18:59.638 --> 19:03.016
Imbecile or not,
he deserves to fry for what he done.

You tell them we headed west.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.739
You mind what I'm saying! We headed west!

19:59.364 --> 20:01.575
Central! Are you on the line?

20:01.950 --> 20:05.412
Oh, God, please!
Somebody took my little girls!

20:13.253 --> 20:14.755
[dogs barking]

20:17.466 --> 20:18.967
Katie!

20:20.260 --> 20:21.678
Cora!

20:34.650 --> 20:36.193
[man screaming]

20:47.871 --> 20:49.164
[sobbing]

20:52.918 --> 20:54.086
Jesus.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.505
Jesus.

21:07.766 --> 21:08.850
I'll kill you!

21:08.934 --> 21:10.269
[groaning]

21:12.688 --> 21:14.189
I'll kill you!

21:16.525 --> 21:17.776
[yelling]

21:26.576 --> 21:28.120
[flies buzzing]

21:28.203 --> 21:29.204
[gasping]

21:33.709 --> 21:34.960
[sobbing]

21:42.217 --> 21:44.177
I... I couldn't help it.

21:45.929 --> 21:48.932
I tried to take it back,
but it was too late.

21:53.103 --> 21:55.522
Boy, you under arrest for murder.

21:58.483 --> 21:59.776
[Hal] I interrupt?

22:02.654 --> 22:04.698
Well, I'm just about done.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.083
Hey,

22:16.001 --> 22:17.419
how's that pretty gal of yours?

22:19.379 --> 22:21.506
Melinda's not so well, Paul.

22:22.382 --> 22:23.467
Not so well at all.

22:25.552 --> 22:26.762
More headaches?

22:27.471 --> 22:30.182
Got laid up with another one yesterday.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.100
Worst one yet.

22:32.893 --> 22:37.022
I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg
next day or so for some tests.

22:37.773 --> 22:40.317
Head X-rays and who knows what else.

22:40.734 --> 22:43.028
She is scared to death.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.532
Truth to tell, so am I.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.787
If it's something they can
see on the X-ray,

22:52.412 --> 22:54.081
maybe it's something they can fix.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.374
Maybe.

23:01.004 --> 23:02.839
This just came in.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.591
DOE on Bitterbuck.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.597
You didn't come all the way down here
just to hand me a DOE.

23:11.765 --> 23:15.727
I had an angry call from
the state capitol about 20 minutes ago.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.396
Is it true you ordered
Percy Wetmore off the block?

23:18.480 --> 23:19.481
It is.

23:21.149 --> 23:23.568
Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul,

23:23.652 --> 23:25.904
but like it or not,

23:25.987 --> 23:28.782
the wife of the governor of this state
has only one nephew,

23:28.865 --> 23:30.909
and his name happens to be Percy Wetmore.

23:30.992 --> 23:36.081
Little Percy calls his aunt
and squeals like a schoolroom sissy.

23:38.125 --> 23:42.504
He also mention he assaulted a prisoner
this morning out of sheer petulance?

23:42.587 --> 23:45.465
Broke three fingers
on Eduard Delacroix's left hand?

23:45.549 --> 23:48.009
I didn't hear that part.
I'm sure she didn't either.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.303
The man is mean and careless and stupid,

23:50.387 --> 23:52.597
and that's a bad combination
in a place like this.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.600
Sooner or later,
he's gonna get somebody hurt or worse.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.727
Stick with it, Paul.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.604
It may not be much longer.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.690
I have it on good authority

24:01.773 --> 24:03.567
that Percy has an application
in at Briar Ridge.

24:04.401 --> 24:07.112
Briar Ridge? The mental hospital.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.405
Administration job.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.448
Better pay.

24:10.532 --> 24:11.783
Hmm.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.910
Then why is he still here?

24:15.620 --> 24:18.206
He can get that application
pushed through.

24:18.665 --> 24:19.708
Hmm.

24:20.458 --> 24:23.545
Hell, with his connections,
he could have any state job he wants.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.214
You know what I think?

24:28.216 --> 24:31.303
I think he just wants to
see one cook up close.

24:34.681 --> 24:37.809
Well, he'll get his chance, then,
won't he?

24:39.519 --> 24:41.980
Maybe then he'll be satisfied and move on.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.648
In the meantime,

24:44.149 --> 24:46.568
-you'll keep the peace?
-Of course.

24:48.486 --> 24:49.696
Of course.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.741
[patting] Thank you, Paul.

24:56.286 --> 24:57.370
Hal,

24:59.080 --> 25:01.708
you give Melinda my love, okay?

25:01.791 --> 25:05.253
I'm sure that X-ray
will turn out to be nothing at all.

25:07.464 --> 25:08.715
You bet.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.767
[soft music playing on radio]

25:35.408 --> 25:36.409
[Jan] Paul.

25:37.410 --> 25:38.787
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.081
The music too loud?

25:43.124 --> 25:45.085
There's just this
big, empty spot in the bed

25:45.168 --> 25:46.753
where my husband usually sleeps.

25:49.464 --> 25:53.551
He said to tell you he's having a little
trouble with that tonight. [sighs]

25:56.638 --> 25:58.890
Worried about Melinda and Hal?

25:59.516 --> 26:01.559
Is that what's got you up?

26:01.977 --> 26:03.478
Yeah, that

26:05.563 --> 26:07.065
and things.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.150
Things.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.157
We got a new inmate today.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.327
Simple-minded fella.

26:20.954 --> 26:23.081
Do I wanna know what he did?

26:24.207 --> 26:25.500
-No.
-Mmm.

26:26.751 --> 26:29.170
Things that happen in this world...

26:30.422 --> 26:32.549
It's a wonder God allows it.

26:37.053 --> 26:39.097
Why don't you come to bed?

26:39.723 --> 26:42.434
I think I have something
to help you sleep.

26:42.517 --> 26:43.518
[Paul] Mmm.

26:43.601 --> 26:45.895
Mmm. You can have all you want.

26:47.522 --> 26:50.150
I still got something wrong
with my waterworks.

26:50.233 --> 26:52.444
I don't wanna pass it on to you.

26:52.527 --> 26:54.946
-Have you seen Doc Bishop yet?
-No.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.197
[sighs] Paul.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.074
[sighs]

26:58.158 --> 27:00.368
Because he's just gonna want me
to take sulfa tablets,

27:00.452 --> 27:02.996
and I'll spend the rest of the week
puking in every corner in my office.

27:03.079 --> 27:07.042
It will run its course all by itself.
Thank you very much for your concern.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.588
Poor old guy.

27:13.923 --> 27:14.966
Oh.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.724
[Brutal laughing]

27:26.061 --> 27:27.812
[Brutal] Paul. Dean.

27:32.567 --> 27:33.610
Yeah?

27:34.319 --> 27:36.029
[mouthing] Come here. Go on.

27:39.115 --> 27:41.576
I guess the legislature
loosened up the purse strings enough

27:41.659 --> 27:43.578
to hire on a new guard.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.005
Look again.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.340
He's right

27:55.757 --> 27:57.050
there.

28:06.017 --> 28:08.853
It ain't normal for a mouse
to come up on people this way.

28:09.604 --> 28:10.688
Maybe it's rabid.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.065
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Oh, my Christ.

28:12.148 --> 28:14.984
-Yeah, it could be.
-Oh, the big mouse expert.

28:15.693 --> 28:18.071
-The mouse man.
-[sighs]

28:18.154 --> 28:20.490
What, you see him foaming
at the mouth, Mouse Man?

28:20.698 --> 28:21.950
I don't see its mouth at all.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.451
[sniggering]

28:31.709 --> 28:33.211
Oh, Brutal, no.

28:33.294 --> 28:36.297
-We'll be hip-deep in mice around here.
-I just wanna see what he'll do.

28:36.798 --> 28:38.883
In the interest of science, like.

29:05.910 --> 29:06.911
[squeaks]

29:19.507 --> 29:21.634
He's in the damn restraint room.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.636
And you just know
he's chewing the padding out of the walls,

29:23.720 --> 29:26.181
making himself a nice little nest.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.226
[clicks tongue]

29:31.603 --> 29:32.937
All right.

29:33.688 --> 29:35.857
Let's go get the damn mouse.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.620
[Coffey] Boss.

29:49.329 --> 29:51.122
Saw me a mouse go by.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.541
Can't put anything over on you.

30:03.384 --> 30:05.720
[murmuring indistinctly]

30:05.804 --> 30:07.806
[Paul] All right. Just watch your toes.
Watch your toes.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.557
-Yeah. All right.
-Here we go.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.201
You let him get past you.

30:28.910 --> 30:31.412
No, I did not.
I've been here all the time.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.498
Then where the hell is he?

30:33.581 --> 30:35.333
Well, I don't know.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.418
[sighs]

30:37.502 --> 30:39.045
Three grown men

30:40.213 --> 30:42.090
outsmarted by a mouse.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.344
[exhales] Well,

30:46.427 --> 30:50.056
bright side is, all this commotion
probably scared him off for good.

30:50.139 --> 30:52.016
[chuckles] Yeah, yeah.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.562
Yeah, that's the last we'll see of him.

30:56.771 --> 30:58.439
[Percy whistling]

31:29.304 --> 31:30.889
[soft squeaking]

31:38.938 --> 31:40.565
[stops whistling]

31:46.821 --> 31:48.823
You little son of a bitch.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.578
[Harry] Well, I'll be damned.

31:53.661 --> 31:58.166
There he is, big as Billy-be-frigged.
I thought Brutal was pulling my leg.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.169
-And that's a goddamn mouse.
-Yeah.

32:02.211 --> 32:04.839
Brute said he was in here last night,

32:05.590 --> 32:07.216
begging for food.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.677
He comes right on up to the desk.

32:11.012 --> 32:12.597
-Give him some room, Percy.
-Huh?

32:12.680 --> 32:15.099
-Yeah, see what he does.
-All right.

32:26.486 --> 32:29.656
[whispers] He's a brave little bastard.
Gotta give him that.

32:55.181 --> 32:56.182
[yells]

32:57.850 --> 32:59.978
-[metal clanking]
-[Percy] Damn!

33:00.311 --> 33:02.730
[screams] You little scurvy! Damn!

33:03.690 --> 33:06.734
Percy, are you crazy,
you little son of a bitch?

33:07.235 --> 33:09.070
-I'm gonna kill you!
-Percy!

33:09.487 --> 33:10.530
[grunts]

33:10.613 --> 33:13.408
-I'm gonna take you out!
-Percy! Percy!

33:13.491 --> 33:17.537
You little vermin!
I'm gonna stomp your life out!

33:17.620 --> 33:19.372
It's just a little mouse, dumb <i>merde.</i>

33:19.455 --> 33:21.749
You ugly little piece of...

33:23.084 --> 33:24.627
-[Harry] Are you listening to me?
-Fuck!

33:24.919 --> 33:28.256
-Percy!
-I'm gonna rip your diseased head off,

33:28.756 --> 33:30.091
you little piece of shit!

33:31.134 --> 33:34.262
[Percy] Get on out of there!
[Harry] I want you to stop this!

33:35.096 --> 33:37.598
Pipe down. I'm talking to you.

33:41.602 --> 33:43.104
Percy.

33:43.187 --> 33:45.189
-[prisoner 1] Hey, boss!
-Hey, Captain, What's going on?

33:51.279 --> 33:53.114
Percy met your mouse.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.535
It's in here somewhere.

33:57.618 --> 33:59.871
I'm gonna squish
the little son of a bitch.

34:02.623 --> 34:05.168
Percy, we already tried that.

34:07.336 --> 34:08.337
Huh?

34:08.713 --> 34:10.214
What'd you say?

34:10.298 --> 34:11.966
I said that we...

34:16.095 --> 34:18.765
Knock yourself out.
Hope you nail the bastard.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.809
[pants] Oh, yeah.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.481
[panting]

34:33.654 --> 34:35.865
Gosh. He ain't in there, huh?

34:36.449 --> 34:38.743
Don't that beat the mousy band?

34:42.038 --> 34:43.206
Percy,

34:45.208 --> 34:47.502
you wanna think about
what you were doing just now?

34:47.794 --> 34:51.005
I was trying to get the mouse.
Are you blind?

34:51.589 --> 34:54.842
You also scared the living crap
out of me and Bill,

34:55.301 --> 34:56.886
not to mention the inmates.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.596
So what?

34:58.679 --> 35:02.183
They aren't in cradle school,
in case you didn't notice.

35:02.850 --> 35:05.061
Although you treat 'em that way
half the time.

35:05.144 --> 35:08.356
We don't scare them
any more than we have to, Percy.

35:08.439 --> 35:12.318
-They're under enough strain as it is.
-Men under strain can snap.

35:13.027 --> 35:15.947
Hurt themselves and hurt others.
That's why our job is

35:17.073 --> 35:18.449
talking,

35:19.200 --> 35:20.576
not yelling.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.037
You'd do better to think of this place

35:23.121 --> 35:24.831
like it's an intensive care ward
of a hospital.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.459
I think of it as a bucket of piss
to drown rats in.

35:29.168 --> 35:30.545
That's all.

35:31.420 --> 35:33.631
Anybody doesn't like it? Hmm?

35:33.714 --> 35:35.466
You can kiss my ass.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.970
[grunts] Don't. Yeah, you try it. Go on.

35:39.053 --> 35:40.304
Try it.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.807
You'll be on the bread lines
before the week is out.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.725
Okay, Brutal. [patting]

35:57.238 --> 35:59.448
We all know
who your connections are, Percy.

36:00.074 --> 36:02.493
You ever threaten a man
on this block again,

36:02.577 --> 36:03.744
we all gonna have a go.

36:04.495 --> 36:05.830
Job be damned.

36:08.457 --> 36:09.750
You done?

36:13.087 --> 36:15.173
Get all this shit back
in the restraining room.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.216
You are cluttering up my Mile.

36:34.108 --> 36:36.819
-[footsteps approaching]
-[keys jangling]

36:39.447 --> 36:40.615
Arlen,

36:41.032 --> 36:43.326
your daughter and her family are here.

36:49.749 --> 36:53.085
Let's move. I want at least
two rehearsals before he gets back.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.462
[door opening]

36:57.006 --> 36:58.966
Uh, settle down, settle down!

36:59.050 --> 37:01.219
Rehearsing now. Everybody settle!

37:01.302 --> 37:03.262
Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward.

37:03.888 --> 37:07.308
Stepping forward, stepping forward,
stepping forward.

37:07.391 --> 37:10.853
-Is his head properly shaved?
-Nope. It's all dandruffy, and it smells.

37:10.937 --> 37:13.814
I will take that as a yes.
Let's go, Arlen.

37:14.857 --> 37:17.360
Walking the Mile, walking the Mile,

37:17.985 --> 37:21.155
walking the Mile, walking the Mile,

37:21.239 --> 37:22.240
walking the Mile,

37:22.323 --> 37:24.075
walking the Mile.

37:24.158 --> 37:27.245
I'm getting to my knees.
I'm praying, praying.

37:27.328 --> 37:30.039
Lord is my shepherd
and so forth and so on.

37:30.289 --> 37:34.669
I'm sorry for all the bad shit I've done
and people I've tramped on and everything.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.170
And I hope they forgive me,

37:36.254 --> 37:39.173
and I'll never do it again,

37:39.257 --> 37:40.299
that's for sure.

37:40.549 --> 37:44.387
Paul, we're not gonna have some
Cherokee medicine man in here,

37:44.470 --> 37:46.555
hooping, hollering
and shaking his dick, are we?

37:46.639 --> 37:49.058
-Well, actually--
-[Toot-Toot] Still praying, still praying.

37:49.141 --> 37:50.768
Getting right with Jesus.

37:50.851 --> 37:53.020
Do it quietly, you old gink!

37:53.980 --> 37:56.774
As I was saying, I don't believe
they actually shake their dicks, Harry.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.902
Be that as it may,
Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian,

37:59.986 --> 38:01.362
so we've got Reverend Schuster coming in.

38:01.445 --> 38:05.157
Oh, he's good. He's fast, too.
Doesn't get 'em all worked up.

38:05.241 --> 38:08.286
On your feet. Come on, Toot.
You prayed enough for one day.

38:08.369 --> 38:10.621
Getting to my feet. Walking the Mile,

38:10.705 --> 38:12.623
walking the Mile, walking the Mile,

38:12.707 --> 38:14.625
walking the Green Mile.

38:14.917 --> 38:16.460
Walking the Mile.

38:16.544 --> 38:18.337
Walking in the Mile.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.048
Sitting down now.

38:22.049 --> 38:23.050
Sitting down.

38:23.676 --> 38:25.594
I'm taking a seat in Old Sparky.

38:26.053 --> 38:27.054
What do I do?

38:28.097 --> 38:31.100
-Watch and learn.
-[Toot-Toot] Watch and learn.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.107
Getting strapped.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.860
Getting clamped.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.071
Gettin' wired.

38:46.073 --> 38:47.408
All right.

38:48.451 --> 38:50.328
Getting all electrode.

38:56.417 --> 38:57.460
[Brutal] Roll on one.

38:58.502 --> 39:01.672
"Roll on one" means
I turn the generator up full.

39:01.756 --> 39:04.008
You see the lights go brighter
in half the prison.

39:04.091 --> 39:05.926
[Brutal] Arlen Bitterbuck,

39:06.010 --> 39:08.888
you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers,

39:08.971 --> 39:12.058
sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.935
You have anything to say
before your sentence is carried out?

39:15.436 --> 39:16.520
Yeah.

39:16.937 --> 39:20.149
I want a fried chicken dinner
with gravy on the taters,

39:20.232 --> 39:21.650
and I want to shit in your hat.

39:22.276 --> 39:26.572
I got to have Mae West sit on my face
'cause I'm one horny motherfucker.

39:26.655 --> 39:27.990
[laughing]

39:31.869 --> 39:32.995
You bastard.

39:33.871 --> 39:35.998
[Toot-Toot] That's a good one.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.249
[Paul] Quiet.

39:37.666 --> 39:38.709
Quiet! Shut up!

39:38.793 --> 39:40.669
-Shut up!
-Sorry, boss.

39:41.670 --> 39:45.091
Toot, one more remark like that,
I'll have Van Hay roll on two for real.

39:46.133 --> 39:48.511
And I'll have one less crazy old trusty
in the world.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.721
It was pretty funny.

39:50.805 --> 39:51.847
That's why I don't like it.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.474
We'll be doing this
for real tomorrow night.

39:54.141 --> 39:56.352
I don't want anybody remembering
some stupid joke like that

39:56.435 --> 39:57.478
and getting going again.

39:58.729 --> 39:59.814
You ever try not to laugh in church

39:59.897 --> 40:01.065
when something funny
gets stuck in your head?

40:01.148 --> 40:03.275
It's the same goddamn thing.

40:04.151 --> 40:06.404
I'm sorry, Paul. You're right.

40:06.487 --> 40:07.988
Let's keep going.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.240
Harry.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.329
Soak the sponge.

40:18.290 --> 40:20.876
[Toot-Toot] Putting on the black hood.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.423
And I'm putting on my cap.

40:25.506 --> 40:27.466
Why's he putting that sponge on his head?

40:27.550 --> 40:30.594
Conducts electricity
directly to the brain, fast like a bullet.

40:31.762 --> 40:34.056
You don't ever throw the switch
on a man without that.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.891
[Toot-Toot mimics gurgling]

40:37.726 --> 40:39.061
[Paul] Hush up there, Toot.

40:39.145 --> 40:40.146
[grunts]

40:42.523 --> 40:44.650
[Toot-Toot] Getting screwed.

40:45.067 --> 40:46.861
I'm getting the cap.

40:49.321 --> 40:50.531
[sighs]

40:51.574 --> 40:53.075
[Brutal] Arlen Bitterbuck,

40:53.159 --> 40:56.662
the electricity shall now be passed
through your body until you are dead

40:56.745 --> 40:58.956
in accordance with state law.

40:59.707 --> 41:01.834
God have mercy on your soul.

41:03.335 --> 41:04.420
Amen.

41:07.047 --> 41:08.090
Roll on two.

41:11.969 --> 41:12.970
And that's that.

41:13.929 --> 41:15.681
[Toot-Toot yelling]

41:16.724 --> 41:19.477
I'm frying! I'm frying!

41:21.812 --> 41:23.939
I'm a done tom turkey!

41:24.023 --> 41:25.357
[chuckles]

41:26.567 --> 41:28.277
This is a shocking experience!

41:30.237 --> 41:33.157
One of the witnesses showed up
a day early.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.079
[Toot-Toot] Goodbye.

41:40.372 --> 41:42.958
All right. Let's do it again,
and let's get it right this time.

41:43.417 --> 41:45.753
Get that idiot out of the chair.

42:45.604 --> 42:49.441
Do you think if a man sincerely repents
on what he done wrong,

42:51.402 --> 42:54.905
that he might get to go back to the time
that was happiest for him,

42:54.989 --> 42:56.865
and live there forever?

42:59.827 --> 43:01.579
Could that be what heaven's like?

43:03.038 --> 43:05.666
I just about believe that very thing.

43:08.794 --> 43:09.837
Hmm.

43:11.839 --> 43:14.300
Had me a young wife when I was 18.

43:15.676 --> 43:19.555
Spent our first summer in the mountains.
Made love every night.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.350
And she'd lie there after,

43:25.102 --> 43:27.396
bare-breasted in the firelight.

43:28.772 --> 43:31.775
And we'd talk sometimes
till the sun come up.

43:35.154 --> 43:37.031
That was my best time.

43:50.919 --> 43:52.504
[inhales deeply]

43:52.588 --> 43:53.881
[exhales]

43:57.593 --> 43:59.386
[Paul] It'll be fine.

44:00.429 --> 44:01.972
You'll do fine.

44:16.070 --> 44:18.072
[Arlen breathing heavily]

44:38.175 --> 44:39.718
[Brutal] Arlen Bitterbuck,

44:39.802 --> 44:42.262
electricity shall now be passed
through your body

44:42.346 --> 44:45.516
until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

44:46.433 --> 44:48.602
-God have mercy on your soul.
-[breathing rapidly]

45:08.497 --> 45:09.706
Roll on two.

45:10.666 --> 45:13.460
-[electricity sizzling]
-[grunting]

45:32.688 --> 45:33.730
[electricity stops]

45:54.334 --> 45:55.377
Again.

45:56.211 --> 45:58.714
[electricity sizzling]

46:02.301 --> 46:04.261
[Percy] <i>Adios,</i> Chief.

46:04.344 --> 46:08.307
Drop us a card from hell.
Let us know if it's hot enough.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.520
He's paid what he owed.

46:14.146 --> 46:16.440
He's square with the house again.

46:16.523 --> 46:19.026
So keep your goddamn hands off him.

46:39.296 --> 46:41.340
What's up his ass?

46:41.423 --> 46:42.758
You.

46:43.675 --> 46:45.969
Always. You, Percy.

46:46.845 --> 46:50.057
Oh, you gotta hate the new boy?
That the way it is around here?

46:52.017 --> 46:55.229
Why don't you just move on?
Take that job at Briar Ridge?

46:55.938 --> 46:58.440
Hmm? Oh, yeah. I know all about it.

46:59.233 --> 47:02.402
Sounds to me like a pretty good job.

47:04.071 --> 47:07.282
Yeah, I might just take it, too,
soon as you put me out front.

47:08.617 --> 47:09.952
Yeah, you heard me.

47:10.536 --> 47:13.121
I want Brutal's spot
for the next execution.

47:16.750 --> 47:18.835
Seeing a man die, now that's not enough.

47:18.919 --> 47:21.171
You gotta be close enough
to smell his nuts cook.

47:21.255 --> 47:23.257
I just wanna be out front, is all.

47:24.883 --> 47:26.885
Come on. One time.

47:28.095 --> 47:29.680
And then you know what?

47:29.763 --> 47:32.516
You'll be rid of me. I swear.

47:33.058 --> 47:34.309
And if l say no?

47:36.061 --> 47:39.356
Well, l might just stick around for good.

47:40.232 --> 47:41.984
Make me a career of this.

47:43.443 --> 47:44.778
Boss.

47:46.655 --> 47:47.864
[sighs]

47:58.792 --> 48:01.920
[soft music playing on radio]

48:06.133 --> 48:08.135
[shuddering]

48:17.227 --> 48:19.646
[Del laughing]

48:32.284 --> 48:33.744
[music stops]

48:37.664 --> 48:38.999
You are not gonna believe this.

48:49.426 --> 48:50.761
Look.

48:52.387 --> 48:54.431
I done tame me that mouse.

48:55.891 --> 48:57.267
We see that.

48:57.351 --> 49:01.521
Oh, oh. Watch this. Watch what he do.

49:04.358 --> 49:05.942
[continues laughing]

49:09.404 --> 49:10.405
Ain't he something now?

49:12.240 --> 49:14.534
He's smart, Mr. Jingles.

49:14.618 --> 49:16.745
-Mr. Jingles?
-That his name.

49:17.329 --> 49:19.206
He whispered in my ear.

49:20.040 --> 49:21.208
Hey, Captain.

49:21.291 --> 49:24.878
Could I have a box for my mouse
so he can sleep in here with me?

49:24.961 --> 49:27.631
I notice your English gets better
when you want something.

49:28.006 --> 49:29.883
Wanna see what else he can do?

49:30.634 --> 49:32.636
Hmm? Watch, watch, watch.

49:33.136 --> 49:36.181
Mr. Jingle? Mr. Jingle, wanna play fetch?

49:36.431 --> 49:38.392
Wanna play fetch? [speaking French]

49:38.934 --> 49:40.936
Play fetch. Watch, watch, watch.

49:48.777 --> 49:50.654
[Del chuckling]

50:00.789 --> 50:03.125
He fetch it every time. Every time.

50:03.917 --> 50:08.338
That's some smart mouse, Del.
Like he a circus mouse or somethin'.

50:10.924 --> 50:14.094
Correct. That just what he is, too.
He's a circus mouse.

50:14.302 --> 50:16.138
When I get out of here,
he's gonna make me rich.

50:16.722 --> 50:19.141
You just watch and see
if he don't do that.

50:19.224 --> 50:21.393
Play fetch? We play fetch again?

50:22.269 --> 50:24.187
[Percy] Well, well, well.

50:24.271 --> 50:26.398
Looks like you found yourself
a new friend there, Del.

50:27.190 --> 50:28.525
Don't hurt him.

50:30.110 --> 50:32.446
-Okay?
-Is that the one l chased?

50:33.071 --> 50:35.157
Yeah, that's the one.

50:35.240 --> 50:38.201
Only Del says his name is Mr. Jingles.

50:39.453 --> 50:40.454
Is that so?

50:41.872 --> 50:43.540
Del's been asking for a box.

50:44.291 --> 50:46.084
Thinks the mouse will sleep in it,
I guess.

50:46.376 --> 50:48.003
Might keep it for a pet.

50:50.630 --> 50:51.798
What do you think?

50:52.966 --> 50:56.595
You know what?
We ought to find a cigar box,

50:57.429 --> 51:01.433
and, uh, get some cotton batting
from the dispensary to line it with.

51:02.559 --> 51:04.186
Yeah.

51:04.269 --> 51:06.396
Yeah. That should do real nice.

51:16.698 --> 51:18.700
Man said get a cigar box.

51:21.411 --> 51:23.622
[telephone ringing distantly]

51:28.752 --> 51:30.170
[secretary] Morning.

51:35.008 --> 51:36.468
Hal, you wanted to see me?

51:37.344 --> 51:38.428
Yeah.

51:39.221 --> 51:40.764
Close the door.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.063
[clears throat]

51:48.146 --> 51:49.439
So you know...

51:49.523 --> 51:51.191
[sniffles]

51:51.274 --> 51:53.693
You got a new prisoner
coming in here tomorrow.

51:54.820 --> 51:56.404
William Wharton.

51:57.364 --> 51:58.698
He's what you call

51:59.533 --> 52:00.534
a problem child.

52:02.160 --> 52:05.038
Got "Billy the Kid" tattooed
on his left arm.

52:06.081 --> 52:09.709
Been rambling all over the state
last few years,

52:10.544 --> 52:12.712
causing all kinds of trouble.

52:13.421 --> 52:15.423
Finally hit the big time.

52:16.883 --> 52:19.636
Killed three people in a holdup.

52:20.387 --> 52:22.597
One of them a pregnant woman.

52:24.850 --> 52:26.601
Bad news all around.

52:28.603 --> 52:29.688
Hal?

52:41.366 --> 52:42.576
It's a tumor, Paul.

52:44.286 --> 52:45.787
A brain tumor.

52:47.747 --> 52:49.624
They got

52:49.708 --> 52:51.293
X-ray pictures of it.

52:53.295 --> 52:55.338
It's the size of a lemon, they said.

52:58.508 --> 52:59.676
And

53:00.927 --> 53:02.262
way down

53:04.306 --> 53:06.433
deep inside, where they can't operate.

53:08.518 --> 53:10.270
I haven't told her.

53:11.938 --> 53:13.607
I can't think how.

53:17.777 --> 53:19.863
For the life of me, Paul,

53:21.406 --> 53:23.825
I can't think how to tell my wife

53:27.871 --> 53:29.623
she's going to die.

53:30.457 --> 53:31.708
[sobbing]

53:53.730 --> 53:55.023
[groaning softly]

53:59.277 --> 54:00.487
[grunts]

54:05.659 --> 54:07.285
[panting]

54:15.502 --> 54:17.128
[dogs barking distantly]

54:18.213 --> 54:19.547
[grunting]

54:28.348 --> 54:29.349
Oh.

54:29.891 --> 54:30.934
Ah.

54:35.230 --> 54:36.314
Aah.

54:37.857 --> 54:39.109
[groans]

54:41.194 --> 54:42.487
[exhales]

54:48.785 --> 54:50.036
[coughs]

54:54.290 --> 54:56.126
Oh... Oh, God.

54:57.168 --> 54:58.712
Oh, God.

55:02.799 --> 55:04.217
I'm going.

55:04.300 --> 55:07.554
-What?
-To see Dr. Bishop. I'm going.

55:08.722 --> 55:10.223
Today.

55:10.682 --> 55:12.892
Soon as we get that new inmate
squared away.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.853
That bad?

55:15.520 --> 55:16.771
Oh, yeah.

55:20.191 --> 55:22.068
[man sobbing distantly]

55:25.030 --> 55:26.614
[door unlocking]

55:39.169 --> 55:41.296
The boy is doped to the gills.

55:42.714 --> 55:43.923
Hmm?

55:44.257 --> 55:45.425
Dean, hand me them clothes.

55:48.553 --> 55:50.138
William Wharton?

55:50.930 --> 55:53.850
Hey! You put on these clothes now,
you hear?

55:54.601 --> 55:56.269
[mumbling]

56:02.233 --> 56:03.359
We're gonna have to do this.

56:05.445 --> 56:07.113
[Percy] Hellraiser, huh?

56:07.363 --> 56:09.365
Look more like a limp noodle to me.

56:09.991 --> 56:11.284
Hey.

56:11.951 --> 56:13.244
Hey.

56:13.828 --> 56:15.080
You've been declared competent, son.

56:16.414 --> 56:17.540
You know what that means?

56:18.333 --> 56:20.794
It means you're gonna ride the lightning.
Yeah.

56:20.877 --> 56:22.462
[chuckling]

56:22.545 --> 56:24.547
Percy, could you shut up,
give us a hand here?

56:25.507 --> 56:26.883
Hellraiser.

56:32.180 --> 56:33.890
[indistinct conversations]

56:48.988 --> 56:50.615
[toilet flushing]

56:58.164 --> 56:59.666
[Del] Boss, you don't look so good.

57:01.793 --> 57:03.753
Look like you're running you a fever.

57:03.837 --> 57:05.672
[phone ringing]

57:09.551 --> 57:11.427
[Coffey] Boss Edgecomb?

57:12.637 --> 57:14.556
I needs to see you down here, boss.

57:17.142 --> 57:19.394
I got things to tend to just now,
John Coffey. You just...

57:22.105 --> 57:24.858
You just stay still in your cell.

57:25.900 --> 57:28.236
[phone continues ringing]

57:37.078 --> 57:38.329
E Block.

57:47.630 --> 57:49.674
[indistinct conversations]

58:14.407 --> 58:16.075
[Dean] Come on, let's go.

58:17.118 --> 58:19.329
Come on. Look alive, big boy.

58:33.968 --> 58:35.261
[softly] Careful.

58:38.806 --> 58:41.851
-Careful.
-[Dean] Step up. Step up.

58:43.853 --> 58:45.355
[gate opening]

58:49.776 --> 58:50.777
[grunts]

58:50.985 --> 58:52.612
[yelling]

58:54.822 --> 58:56.157
[whooping]

59:00.954 --> 59:01.955
[grunting]

59:04.874 --> 59:06.125
[grunts]

59:09.879 --> 59:11.548
[laughing]

59:16.427 --> 59:17.637
Where you going? Where you going?

59:20.932 --> 59:22.225
[Wharton yelling]

59:22.725 --> 59:23.977
Ain't this a party now?

59:24.352 --> 59:25.562
-Is it or what?
-Let him go.

59:25.853 --> 59:27.313
-[Dean] Shoot him.
-Shoot! See who you hit.

59:27.689 --> 59:29.315
-[Dean] Shoot the son of a bitch.
-Come on, shoot me!

59:29.691 --> 59:32.860
-Shoot him!
-Hit him, Percy! God damn it! Hit him.

59:33.361 --> 59:34.779
Hit me, you limp noodle.

59:34.862 --> 59:37.156
Hit him, Percy! God damn it, hit him!

59:37.532 --> 59:40.368
-Come on, Percy. Hit me.
-Wharton, I'm warning you.

59:40.702 --> 59:43.288
-You warning me? Warn me now.
-[Paul] I'm warning you!

59:43.371 --> 59:45.331
-You're warning me?
-[Dean] Shoot him!

59:45.999 --> 59:47.166
-Well, come on...
-[grunts]

59:48.835 --> 59:50.086
[panting]

59:50.169 --> 59:51.421
[clicks safety on]

59:51.504 --> 59:52.839
[groans]

59:53.673 --> 59:54.841
You're a big fucker.

59:56.092 --> 59:57.260
Where'd you come from?

59:57.343 --> 59:58.553
[grunts]

59:59.679 --> 1:00:00.847
[Dean grunting]

1:00:08.062 --> 1:00:10.315
[Brutal] Come on, Dean.
Come on, boy, get up.

1:00:10.398 --> 1:00:12.191
-[gasping]
-All right. Now, just breathe.

1:00:12.817 --> 1:00:14.944
That's it. Just breathe. Just breathe.

1:00:16.863 --> 1:00:18.823
Breathe. Breathe, boy.

1:00:18.906 --> 1:00:20.325
-[Dean] Didn't see it coming.
-Come on, boy, breathe.

1:00:20.408 --> 1:00:21.993
[Dean] Didn't see it coming.

1:00:22.076 --> 1:00:23.953
Come on. Just breathe.

1:00:26.789 --> 1:00:28.750
We thought he was doped.

1:00:30.209 --> 1:00:33.588
Didn't we?
Didn't we all of us think he was doped?

1:00:33.671 --> 1:00:35.340
You didn't ask?

1:00:36.716 --> 1:00:38.509
Well, l guess that's not a mistake

1:00:39.052 --> 1:00:41.888
you'll be needing to make again
anytime soon, is it?

1:00:56.235 --> 1:00:59.447
You go get Dean and Harry looked at.
Make sure they're all right.

1:01:00.406 --> 1:01:03.284
Percy, you make the report
to the warden for me.

1:01:04.077 --> 1:01:05.662
Start out by saying
the situation's under control.

1:01:05.745 --> 1:01:06.788
It's not a story.

1:01:06.871 --> 1:01:09.624
He will not appreciate you
drawing out the suspense.

1:01:09.707 --> 1:01:12.126
Well, what about you?
You're about ready to collapse.

1:01:12.210 --> 1:01:15.213
Ah, I've got the Mile
till you all come back.

1:01:16.297 --> 1:01:17.840
Go on, now. Go.

1:01:23.554 --> 1:01:24.764
[grunts softly]

1:01:25.932 --> 1:01:28.935
[Brutal] Come on, boy.
Let's get you looked at.

1:01:33.606 --> 1:01:34.774
-[door closes]
-[breathing heavily]

1:01:54.711 --> 1:01:57.630
[Coffey] Boss,
I needs to see you down here.

1:02:01.676 --> 1:02:05.054
This is not a good time, John Coffey.

1:02:05.138 --> 1:02:07.140
Not a good time at all.

1:02:07.223 --> 1:02:11.227
But l needs to see you, boss.
I needs to talk to you.

1:02:11.769 --> 1:02:12.979
[breathing heavily]

1:02:18.317 --> 1:02:20.319
[grunting]

1:02:33.499 --> 1:02:34.709
Closer.

1:02:35.334 --> 1:02:37.336
Boss, you know you ain't
supposed to do that.

1:02:39.005 --> 1:02:40.965
Mind your business, Del.

1:02:50.683 --> 1:02:52.727
What do you want, John Coffey?

1:02:53.686 --> 1:02:54.812
[whispering] Just to help it.

1:02:58.566 --> 1:03:00.026
[Coffey] Don't be afraid.

1:03:00.526 --> 1:03:01.611
Help!

1:03:02.403 --> 1:03:05.156
Help! John Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

1:03:05.364 --> 1:03:06.949
Help!

1:03:07.033 --> 1:03:10.369
-What are you doing?
-[Del] Help!

1:03:12.872 --> 1:03:14.540
Boss Howell! Help!

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:17.210
-[grunts]
-Boss Stanton! Somebody, come!

1:03:17.543 --> 1:03:19.587
Help!

1:03:21.297 --> 1:03:22.840
[Paul grunting]

1:03:27.512 --> 1:03:28.763
[screams]

1:03:32.558 --> 1:03:35.645
[Del] Help!

1:03:35.728 --> 1:03:38.064
Help! Boss Howell! Boss Stanton!

1:03:38.397 --> 1:03:41.359
Somebody, come!
John Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!

1:03:41.442 --> 1:03:43.736
Del, for Christ sakes, shut up!

1:03:44.570 --> 1:03:45.738
[Coffey coughing]

1:04:30.616 --> 1:04:32.743
What did you just do to me?

1:04:34.871 --> 1:04:36.455
I helped it.

1:04:37.623 --> 1:04:39.250
Didn't l help it?

1:04:40.293 --> 1:04:42.128
I just took it back, is all.

1:04:43.462 --> 1:04:45.298
Awful tired now, boss.

1:04:46.465 --> 1:04:47.800
Dog-tired.

1:05:12.325 --> 1:05:15.077
[Del] Boss, what that man do to you?

1:05:38.434 --> 1:05:40.144
[unzipping]

1:05:42.021 --> 1:05:44.357
[urinating]

1:05:55.201 --> 1:05:56.744
[sighs]

1:06:01.082 --> 1:06:02.959
[sighs heavily]

1:06:04.043 --> 1:06:06.212
[soft music playing on radio]

1:06:17.723 --> 1:06:20.226
Hey, honey. How you feeling?

1:06:22.353 --> 1:06:24.563
Oh, not too bad.

1:06:26.273 --> 1:06:27.400
What did the doctor say?

1:06:30.403 --> 1:06:32.196
Oh, you know doctors.

1:06:32.613 --> 1:06:34.407
Gobbledygook, mostly.

1:06:35.491 --> 1:06:36.951
Gobbledygook.

1:06:48.921 --> 1:06:50.464
[clicks tongue]

1:06:52.258 --> 1:06:53.884
Having stew tonight.

1:07:04.061 --> 1:07:05.771
What are you doing?

1:07:12.611 --> 1:07:14.488
What does it feel like?

1:07:15.156 --> 1:07:17.491
Well, l know what it feels like.

1:07:21.454 --> 1:07:23.289
It feels great.

1:07:32.631 --> 1:07:35.134
-[Jan moaning]
-[bed creaking]

1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:45.019
[Paul moaning]

1:07:49.982 --> 1:07:51.275
[Jan] Mmm.

1:07:57.615 --> 1:07:59.325
-Paul.
-Yeah?

1:07:59.950 --> 1:08:02.661
-Not that I'm complaining...
-Uh-huh.

1:08:03.954 --> 1:08:07.416
But we haven't gone four times
in one night since we were 19.

1:08:07.500 --> 1:08:10.169
-Yeah, we did, at your mom's, yeah.
-Mmm-hmm.

1:08:11.670 --> 1:08:13.881
Wanna tell me what's going on?

1:08:13.964 --> 1:08:15.216
[panting]

1:08:17.301 --> 1:08:18.677
Well...

1:08:20.179 --> 1:08:21.972
See, the thing is

1:08:23.516 --> 1:08:26.602
I never actually made it in
to Dr. Bishop's yesterday.

1:08:30.064 --> 1:08:32.525
Brutal, Paul. Listen.

1:08:33.025 --> 1:08:35.694
I'm thinking of taking
the morning off sick.

1:08:35.778 --> 1:08:37.363
You cover the fort for me?

1:08:38.531 --> 1:08:40.866
That's swell. Thanks.

1:08:40.950 --> 1:08:43.786
Yeah, no.
[stammering] I'm sure I'll feel better.

1:08:43.869 --> 1:08:45.788
Okay. Okay.

1:08:51.877 --> 1:08:53.003
You're sure you ought to do this?

1:08:55.506 --> 1:08:57.383
I'm not sure what I'm sure of.

1:09:14.567 --> 1:09:16.986
Burt, you got some company.

1:09:18.237 --> 1:09:19.989
Can l offer you a cold drink?

1:09:20.072 --> 1:09:22.741
Oh, yes, ma'am.
A cold drink would be fine. Thank you.

1:09:23.492 --> 1:09:26.704
Mr. Hammersmith, your office said
I might find you at home today.

1:09:26.787 --> 1:09:28.455
Hope I'm not troubling you.

1:09:29.123 --> 1:09:31.333
Well, that depends, Mr...

1:09:31.417 --> 1:09:35.421
Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block supervisor
up on Cold Mountain.

1:09:36.714 --> 1:09:38.174
The Green Mile.

1:09:38.257 --> 1:09:41.260
Yeah, I've heard of it.
Lost a few clients your way.

1:09:42.136 --> 1:09:43.846
I'd like to ask you about one of 'em.

1:09:43.929 --> 1:09:45.973
[thunder rumbling]

1:09:46.056 --> 1:09:48.017
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

1:09:52.688 --> 1:09:53.814
Which client?

1:09:53.898 --> 1:09:55.107
[clears throat]

1:09:56.025 --> 1:09:58.444
Now you got my curiosity aroused.

1:09:59.028 --> 1:10:00.362
John Coffey.

1:10:00.446 --> 1:10:01.447
Ah.

1:10:01.530 --> 1:10:03.073
Coffey.

1:10:03.157 --> 1:10:04.450
He causing you problems?

1:10:04.825 --> 1:10:08.621
No. No, can't say he is. He doesn't like
the dark and cries on occasion.

1:10:08.704 --> 1:10:10.497
But other than that...

1:10:10.581 --> 1:10:13.876
He cries, does he?
Well, got a lot to cry about, I'd say.

1:10:14.168 --> 1:10:15.711
You know what he did.

1:10:16.378 --> 1:10:18.172
I read the court transcript.

1:10:19.590 --> 1:10:21.926
-Thank you, missus.
-My pleasure.

1:10:23.093 --> 1:10:26.096
Kids! Lunch is about ready.
Y'all come on up.

1:10:26.555 --> 1:10:27.806
[both] Coming, Mama!

1:10:27.890 --> 1:10:30.976
What exactly are you trying to find out?

1:10:31.769 --> 1:10:34.104
I've wondered if he ever did
anything like that before.

1:10:35.564 --> 1:10:37.483
Why? Has he said anything?

1:10:37.566 --> 1:10:40.319
No, but a man who does a thing like that

1:10:41.111 --> 1:10:43.280
has often developed
a taste for it over time.

1:10:43.364 --> 1:10:44.240
It occurred to me

1:10:45.157 --> 1:10:48.494
that it might be easy enough
to follow his back trail. Find out.

1:10:49.828 --> 1:10:53.332
A man his size, and colored to boot,
can't be that hard to trace.

1:10:53.832 --> 1:10:57.086
You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.

1:10:57.169 --> 1:10:59.338
Believe me, we tried.

1:11:00.005 --> 1:11:01.507
Like he dropped out of the sky.

1:11:03.008 --> 1:11:04.593
How can that be?

1:11:04.677 --> 1:11:08.430
We're in a depression.
A third of the country's out of work.

1:11:08.973 --> 1:11:13.227
People are drifting by the thousands,
looking for jobs, for that greener grass.

1:11:13.310 --> 1:11:16.355
Even a giant like Coffey
wouldn't get noticed everywhere he goes.

1:11:17.231 --> 1:11:19.525
Not until he kills
a couple of little girls.

1:11:20.401 --> 1:11:21.819
He is, uh,

1:11:22.361 --> 1:11:24.405
strange, l admit.

1:11:24.822 --> 1:11:28.575
But there doesn't seem to be
any real violence in him.

1:11:29.535 --> 1:11:31.996
I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.

1:11:32.079 --> 1:11:34.123
I deal with them day in and day out.

1:11:35.874 --> 1:11:38.627
You didn't come up here to ask me
whether he might have killed before.

1:11:38.711 --> 1:11:40.963
You came up here to see
if l think he did it at all.

1:11:43.048 --> 1:11:44.633
-Do you?
-[thunder rumbling]

1:11:45.968 --> 1:11:48.262
One seldom sees a less ambiguous case.

1:11:48.345 --> 1:11:50.472
He was found with the victims in his arms.

1:11:50.556 --> 1:11:52.224
And yet you defended him.

1:11:53.350 --> 1:11:55.394
Everyone is entitled to a defense.

1:11:56.437 --> 1:11:58.230
[Cynthia] Kids! Lunch!

1:11:58.314 --> 1:11:59.606
Y'all listen to your mama now!

1:12:04.153 --> 1:12:06.113
I'll tell you something.

1:12:06.864 --> 1:12:08.991
And you listen close, too,
because it might be something

1:12:09.074 --> 1:12:10.576
you need to know.

1:12:10.659 --> 1:12:12.036
I'm listening.

1:12:13.412 --> 1:12:14.538
We had us a dog.

1:12:15.581 --> 1:12:17.666
Just a sweet mongrel.

1:12:17.750 --> 1:12:19.251
You know the kind.

1:12:20.669 --> 1:12:24.006
Well, in many ways,
a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.

1:12:24.923 --> 1:12:26.633
You get to know it.

1:12:26.967 --> 1:12:31.388
Often, you get to love it.
It is of no particular use,

1:12:31.472 --> 1:12:34.433
but you keep it around
because you think it loves you.

1:12:34.516 --> 1:12:36.143
[chuckles]

1:12:36.518 --> 1:12:40.606
If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb,
you never have to find out any different.

1:12:41.732 --> 1:12:43.108
My wife and l were not so lucky.

1:12:45.903 --> 1:12:47.446
Caleb, come here for a second.

1:12:48.781 --> 1:12:50.115
Come here.

1:12:51.450 --> 1:12:52.659
Please, son.

1:12:54.286 --> 1:12:56.163
He still has the one good eye.

1:12:58.123 --> 1:13:00.459
I suppose he's lucky

1:13:00.542 --> 1:13:02.628
not to be completely blind.

1:13:05.672 --> 1:13:09.176
We get down on our knees
and thank God for that much at least.

1:13:10.052 --> 1:13:11.512
Right, Caleb?

1:13:13.972 --> 1:13:15.307
Okay, go on in now.

1:13:16.058 --> 1:13:17.559
[door opening]

1:13:17.643 --> 1:13:18.727
[door closing]

1:13:18.811 --> 1:13:21.480
That dog attacked my boy for no reason.

1:13:22.314 --> 1:13:24.316
Just got it in his mind one day.

1:13:25.234 --> 1:13:26.860
The same with John Coffey.

1:13:26.944 --> 1:13:31.115
He was sorry afterwards.
Of that l have no doubt.

1:13:31.824 --> 1:13:36.120
But those little girls
stayed raped and murdered.

1:13:36.995 --> 1:13:38.997
Maybe he'd never done it before.

1:13:40.791 --> 1:13:42.751
My dog never bit before.

1:13:44.670 --> 1:13:47.339
But l didn't concern myself with that.

1:13:48.424 --> 1:13:50.217
I went out there with my rifle

1:13:50.300 --> 1:13:52.302
and grabbed his collar
and blew his brains out.

1:13:53.762 --> 1:13:54.888
Is Coffey guilty?

1:13:57.891 --> 1:13:59.601
Yes, he is.

1:14:00.144 --> 1:14:01.145
Don't you doubt it.

1:14:02.229 --> 1:14:04.773
And don't you turn your back on him.

1:14:05.566 --> 1:14:06.942
You may get away with it once

1:14:07.484 --> 1:14:09.445
or even a hundred times.

1:14:10.571 --> 1:14:12.114
But in the end,

1:14:14.241 --> 1:14:15.784
you'll get bit.

1:14:17.161 --> 1:14:19.246
-[music playing softly]
-[footsteps approaching]

1:14:28.297 --> 1:14:30.841
Oh, me! Oh, my!

1:14:33.051 --> 1:14:34.803
[Paul] John.

1:14:34.887 --> 1:14:36.138
John.

1:14:37.681 --> 1:14:39.766
I'm smelling me some corn bread.

1:14:40.350 --> 1:14:42.102
It's from my missus.

1:14:45.898 --> 1:14:48.233
She wanted to thank you.

1:14:49.651 --> 1:14:51.069
Thank me for what?

1:14:51.487 --> 1:14:53.030
Well, you know.

1:14:55.491 --> 1:14:56.909
[whispers] For helping me.

1:14:57.618 --> 1:14:59.161
Helping you with what?

1:14:59.870 --> 1:15:01.121
You know.

1:15:03.832 --> 1:15:05.250
Oh.

1:15:07.544 --> 1:15:09.505
Was your missus pleased?

1:15:11.340 --> 1:15:13.008
Several times.

1:15:28.524 --> 1:15:32.069
Oh, John, I can smell that from over here.
I surely can.

1:15:34.905 --> 1:15:37.199
Can l give Del and Mr. Jingles some?

1:15:37.783 --> 1:15:41.370
Well, it's yours, John.
You can do with it as you please.

1:15:44.456 --> 1:15:47.960
Here. This for Del and Mr. Jingles.

1:15:48.627 --> 1:15:52.297
Hey! What about me?
I'm gonna get some, too, ain't l?

1:15:54.466 --> 1:15:57.594
It's yours, John. As you please.

1:15:58.178 --> 1:16:00.889
[whispering]
I think I'll just keep the rest, then.

1:16:06.687 --> 1:16:08.897
Courtesy of the gentleman across the way.

1:16:10.065 --> 1:16:13.944
Oh, John, that's so very fine of you.
[chuckles]

1:16:14.903 --> 1:16:16.989
I thank you. Mr. Jingle thank you.

1:16:17.072 --> 1:16:18.824
My mama would thank you too,
but she dead.

1:16:19.491 --> 1:16:20.701
Welcome.

1:16:20.784 --> 1:16:22.786
Hey! What about me?

1:16:22.869 --> 1:16:26.081
Don't you hold out on me,
you big dummy nigger.

1:16:26.665 --> 1:16:28.959
[laughing]

1:16:29.293 --> 1:16:31.753
Ooh, here come the boss man.

1:16:32.671 --> 1:16:35.132
You'll keep a civil tongue on my block.

1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:48.604
You get that one for free.

1:16:49.605 --> 1:16:51.231
But that's the last one.

1:16:51.315 --> 1:16:54.735
[laughing] That's it?
Just that little itty-bitty one?

1:16:55.485 --> 1:16:59.031
I guess I'm gonna have
to pay you out for the rest, huh?

1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:09.041
[splashing]

1:17:10.208 --> 1:17:11.376
[Wharton laughing]

1:17:11.460 --> 1:17:13.003
Yee-haw!

1:17:13.086 --> 1:17:14.129
Good shot, weren't it?

1:17:14.546 --> 1:17:15.672
[continues laughing]

1:17:16.423 --> 1:17:18.634
The look on your face!

1:17:22.888 --> 1:17:24.514
[Harry] Do you believe this?

1:17:24.598 --> 1:17:26.808
That son of a bitch pissed on me.

1:17:26.892 --> 1:17:28.852
[Wharton laughing] Did y'all like that?

1:17:28.935 --> 1:17:32.064
I'm currently cooking up some turds
to go with it.

1:17:32.439 --> 1:17:33.982
Nice soft ones.

1:17:34.066 --> 1:17:36.777
[grunts] Have 'em out to y'all tomorrow.

1:17:38.862 --> 1:17:41.907
We've been meaning to clean out
that room for a while, haven't we?

1:17:41.990 --> 1:17:43.241
Oh, yeah.

1:17:43.325 --> 1:17:47.162
[Wharton] Hey! Hey!
Be careful with that. That's fragile.

1:17:47.245 --> 1:17:51.833
Hey. Hey! What is it now?
What's it now? Moving day?

1:17:51.917 --> 1:17:54.044
Y'all wanna come on in here
and dust a little?

1:17:54.544 --> 1:17:57.631
You can shine my knob for me
while you're at it.

1:18:11.478 --> 1:18:13.980
You can come in here on your legs,

1:18:14.064 --> 1:18:16.483
but you'll go out on your backs.

1:18:16.566 --> 1:18:19.277
Billy the Kid gonna guarantee you that.

1:18:20.278 --> 1:18:23.573
Come on, fuck-stick.
No sneaking up on me this time.

1:18:23.657 --> 1:18:25.450
We'll go man-to-man.

1:18:29.287 --> 1:18:30.330
Piss on me?

1:18:31.415 --> 1:18:33.959
[yelling]

1:18:49.349 --> 1:18:51.101
[coughing]

1:18:53.270 --> 1:18:55.230
[grunting]

1:18:56.982 --> 1:18:59.693
Come on, Wild Bill. Little walky-walky.

1:18:59.776 --> 1:19:03.989
Don't you call me that!
Wild Bill Hickok wasn't no range rider!

1:19:04.406 --> 1:19:06.575
He was just some bushwhacking John Law!

1:19:06.658 --> 1:19:09.578
Dumb son of a bitch sat with his back
to the door, killed by a drunk.

1:19:09.661 --> 1:19:12.372
Oh, my suds and body. A history lesson.

1:19:12.998 --> 1:19:14.374
Oh, you just never know
what you're gonna get

1:19:14.458 --> 1:19:15.709
when you come to work every day
on the Green Mile.

1:19:15.792 --> 1:19:16.835
[chuckling]

1:19:18.962 --> 1:19:20.589
Thank you, Wild Bill.

1:19:27.471 --> 1:19:28.638
[whimpering]

1:19:28.722 --> 1:19:31.600
Not in there. Not in there.
I'll be good. Fellas, I'll be good.

1:19:31.683 --> 1:19:33.894
Honest Injun, I will. I will.

1:19:34.519 --> 1:19:36.521
[gurgling]

1:19:39.483 --> 1:19:41.443
[Harry] Christ, he's pitching a fit.

1:19:41.526 --> 1:19:43.278
He'll be fine, boys. Trust me on this one.

1:19:43.361 --> 1:19:44.529
One, two, three.

Hey! Hey!

Hey, hey!

1:19:52.871 --> 1:19:53.872
Hey, fellers.

1:19:54.748 --> 1:19:57.125
Hey, it's not funny. You won't leave...

1:20:00.587 --> 1:20:03.799
All I wanted me was a little corn bread,
you motherfuckers!

1:20:03.882 --> 1:20:05.967
All I wanted me was a little corn bread!

[door opening]

1:20:14.392 --> 1:20:16.686
I... I learned my lesson.

1:20:16.770 --> 1:20:18.230
I'll be good.

1:20:24.653 --> 1:20:26.238
[belches]

1:20:29.950 --> 1:20:31.368
[Wharton] Psst.

1:20:31.451 --> 1:20:32.494
Hey, Toot.

1:20:34.663 --> 1:20:36.665
Give you a nickel for that MoonPie.

1:21:12.909 --> 1:21:15.161
Ooh, ooh.

1:21:15.412 --> 1:21:17.622
Little Black Sambo! Yo!

1:21:18.748 --> 1:21:22.502
[imitating Sambo]
Yes, sir, yes, sir. How do you do?

1:21:23.920 --> 1:21:26.256
Hope your bags are packed.

1:21:26.339 --> 1:21:28.592
My bags are packed! I'm ready to go!

1:21:28.675 --> 1:21:30.635
Where are we going? Let's go!

1:21:30.969 --> 1:21:33.054
No! No! No!

1:21:33.138 --> 1:21:34.973
No! No! No!

1:21:35.056 --> 1:21:37.267
No! No! No!

Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

1:21:44.024 --> 1:21:47.736
That MoonPie thing was pretty original.
Gotta give him that.

1:21:47.819 --> 1:21:49.779
[Wharton sobbing]

1:21:49.863 --> 1:21:51.156
Oh, yeah.

1:21:52.741 --> 1:21:55.285
[footsteps approaching]

1:22:06.296 --> 1:22:10.091
Del, grab up your things.
It's a big day for you and Mr. Jingles.

1:22:10.175 --> 1:22:11.509
What you talking about?

1:22:11.593 --> 1:22:15.430
Important folks heard about your mouse.
Wanna see him perform.

1:22:15.513 --> 1:22:17.098
[Paul] Not just prison guards either.

1:22:17.182 --> 1:22:20.185
One's a politician all the way
from the state capitol I believe.

1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:24.105
You fellas coming?

1:22:24.189 --> 1:22:26.107
No, we got other fish to fry
just now, Del,

1:22:26.858 --> 1:22:30.362
but you knock 'em for a loop, yeah.

1:22:31.404 --> 1:22:33.239
You knock 'em for a loop, Del.

1:22:33.657 --> 1:22:35.659
Just like Mr. Harry says.

1:22:45.502 --> 1:22:46.586
[door locking]

1:22:47.587 --> 1:22:49.881
All right. Let's move briskly, folks.
There's not much time.

1:22:50.423 --> 1:22:53.176
All right, rehearsing now!

1:22:53.259 --> 1:22:55.804
Gotta move our ass. Ain't got much time.

1:22:56.137 --> 1:22:59.516
I been fixing the plumbing here
for ten years.

1:22:59.599 --> 1:23:02.018
Ain't never had to wear
no damn tie before.

1:23:02.102 --> 1:23:05.480
Well, you're the VIP today, Earl,
so just shut up.

1:23:05.563 --> 1:23:07.232
[knocking on door]

1:23:07.774 --> 1:23:10.235
All right, everybody, have a seat.

1:23:25.834 --> 1:23:27.460
This is great.

1:23:33.466 --> 1:23:34.509
[whispering] All right.

1:23:36.219 --> 1:23:40.974
Eduard Delacroix, electricity shall
now be passed through your body

1:23:41.057 --> 1:23:44.227
until you are dead,
in accordance with state law.

1:23:45.437 --> 1:23:47.564
God have mercy on your soul.

1:23:56.614 --> 1:23:57.782
Roll on two.

1:24:01.911 --> 1:24:02.912
That's that.

1:24:06.499 --> 1:24:09.044
Very good. Very professional.

1:24:12.005 --> 1:24:13.673
Let's do it again.

1:24:14.132 --> 1:24:17.343
You got all the words right.
It sounded just fine.

1:24:17.427 --> 1:24:18.762
-Thank you.
-Yep.

1:24:18.845 --> 1:24:21.890
It's hard to keep a straight face
when Toot's acting the goat.

1:24:21.973 --> 1:24:25.143
You got that chin strap good and tight
because his head is gonna buck--

1:24:25.727 --> 1:24:27.604
-All right, break it up.
-[door opening]

1:24:27.687 --> 1:24:29.522

1:24:31.608 --> 1:24:34.736
-So?
-Oh, they love Mr. Jingles.

1:24:34.819 --> 1:24:36.112
They laugh over there,

1:24:36.196 --> 1:24:39.574
they cheer, they clap their hands.

1:24:40.575 --> 1:24:42.535
Well, that's just aces.

1:24:43.286 --> 1:24:45.121
Isn't that something?

1:24:45.205 --> 1:24:46.748
You done good, old-timer.

1:24:47.499 --> 1:24:49.334
We're happy for you.
[chuckling]

1:24:50.835 --> 1:24:52.670
Yeah, we are.

1:24:57.509 --> 1:24:59.052
[continues laughing]

1:25:03.098 --> 1:25:04.182
Boo!

Percy, you shit.

1:25:13.399 --> 1:25:15.610
Come on. Del, get up.

1:25:15.693 --> 1:25:19.239
Del, you numb-wit.
I didn't mean nothing by it.

1:25:19.572 --> 1:25:22.408
I was just playing. Come on, now.

1:25:22.492 --> 1:25:24.619
I was just having... [screaming]

-Ain't you sweet?
-[Paul] Wharton.

1:25:29.374 --> 1:25:31.584
-Soft like a girl.
-[Paul] Let him go.

1:25:31.668 --> 1:25:35.755
I'd rather fuck your asshole
than your sister's pussy, l think.

1:25:36.172 --> 1:25:37.507
Wharton!

1:25:37.590 --> 1:25:39.384
[yelling]

1:25:40.385 --> 1:25:41.719
[laughing]

1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:46.808
I let him go. I was just playing.
I let him go.

1:25:46.891 --> 1:25:49.310
I'd never hurt a hair
on his pretty little head.

1:25:50.061 --> 1:25:52.856
Your noodle ain't limp at all, lover boy.

1:25:52.939 --> 1:25:55.650
I think you sweet on old Billy the Kid.

1:25:56.901 --> 1:25:59.988
Ooh, but smell you.

1:26:00.071 --> 1:26:01.781
[Del laughing]

1:26:06.995 --> 1:26:08.329
[Del] Look.

1:26:08.705 --> 1:26:10.081
He done piss his pants.

1:26:12.292 --> 1:26:14.252
[whispering] Oh, my god.

1:26:15.587 --> 1:26:16.796
[Del] Look what the big man done.

1:26:17.505 --> 1:26:20.842
-He bust other people with a stick.
-Come on, get in.

1:26:20.925 --> 1:26:22.969
[speaks French]

1:26:23.052 --> 1:26:26.431
Somebody touch him, he make water
in his pants like a little baby.

1:26:26.556 --> 1:26:28.057
[door locking]

1:26:28.766 --> 1:26:29.934
Del!

1:26:30.310 --> 1:26:31.561
Learn when to shut up.

1:26:32.770 --> 1:26:34.272
All right, now.

1:26:35.940 --> 1:26:37.775
[whispering] Don't touch me.

1:26:51.956 --> 1:26:53.750
You...

1:26:53.833 --> 1:26:56.502
You talk about this to anyone,

1:26:56.920 --> 1:26:59.130
I'll get you all fired.

1:27:00.798 --> 1:27:02.467
I swear that to God.

1:27:04.093 --> 1:27:08.306
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile. Always has.

1:27:12.644 --> 1:27:13.978
[chuckling]

1:27:15.438 --> 1:27:19.317
Yeah, you keep laughing,
you French-fried faggot!

1:27:19.817 --> 1:27:21.819
You just keep on laughin'!

1:27:24.822 --> 1:27:28.493
Wetmore a good name for you!
[laughing]

1:27:29.661 --> 1:27:31.746
Percy Wetmore do a dance.

1:27:31.829 --> 1:27:34.666
Listen to him squishing in his pant.
[continues laughing]

1:27:46.052 --> 1:27:47.428
[Paul] Well, what about Dean?

1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:49.264
He's got a little boy.

1:27:49.347 --> 1:27:51.474
He'd love to have a pet mouse, I bet.

1:27:54.519 --> 1:27:57.438
How could a boy
be trusted with Mr. Jingle?

1:27:57.855 --> 1:27:59.857
Maybe forget to feed him.

1:28:00.692 --> 1:28:02.026
How he keep up with his training?

1:28:02.110 --> 1:28:04.320
I mean, he just a boy, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

1:28:04.654 --> 1:28:06.030
Hmm.

1:28:13.913 --> 1:28:16.666
[clicks tongue]
All right. I'll take him, then.

1:28:17.500 --> 1:28:19.043
-Me.
-[laughing]

1:28:19.711 --> 1:28:21.921
[speaks French] Thank you kindly, but...

1:28:22.505 --> 1:28:23.673
[sighs]

1:28:23.756 --> 1:28:25.800
You live out in the woods.

1:28:25.883 --> 1:28:27.302
Mr. Jingle, he be...

1:28:28.469 --> 1:28:30.972
He be scared to live out in the big woods.

1:28:36.644 --> 1:28:38.438
How about Mouseville?

1:28:39.605 --> 1:28:40.606
Mouseville?

1:28:40.898 --> 1:28:42.859
Tourist attraction down in Florida.

1:28:44.235 --> 1:28:45.778
Tallahassee, l think.

1:28:46.195 --> 1:28:48.156
-Is that right, Paul? Tallahassee?
-Yeah, yeah.

1:28:48.698 --> 1:28:49.866
Tallahassee.

1:28:49.949 --> 1:28:52.827
It's just down the road a-piece
from the dog university.

1:28:56.080 --> 1:28:59.751
You think, uh...
You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?

1:29:00.918 --> 1:29:02.462
You think he's got the stuff?

1:29:02.879 --> 1:29:04.547
Well, he is pretty smart.

1:29:05.923 --> 1:29:07.550
What is Mouseville?

1:29:07.633 --> 1:29:10.011
Tourist attraction, l said.

1:29:10.094 --> 1:29:11.804
They got this big tent you go into.

1:29:11.888 --> 1:29:13.514
-You have to pay?
-What, are you shitting me?

1:29:13.598 --> 1:29:15.433
Of course you pay.

1:29:15.516 --> 1:29:19.270
-Dime apiece. Two cents for the kids.
-For the kids.

1:29:19.354 --> 1:29:21.439
Inside the tent they got this, uh,

1:29:22.482 --> 1:29:23.524
mouse city

1:29:24.484 --> 1:29:26.110
made out of

1:29:26.194 --> 1:29:30.365
old boxes and toilet paper rolls,
little windows so you can look in.

1:29:31.282 --> 1:29:35.286
Plus, they got
the Mouseville All-Star Circus.

1:29:36.829 --> 1:29:39.290
Yeah, there's mice that swing on trapeze.

1:29:39.957 --> 1:29:43.544
Mice that roll barrels.
Mice that stack coins.

1:29:43.628 --> 1:29:44.962
[chuckling]

1:29:47.632 --> 1:29:48.716
Yeah, that's it.

1:29:50.384 --> 1:29:52.136
That's the place for Mr. Jingles.

1:29:54.972 --> 1:29:55.973
Oh!

1:29:57.141 --> 1:29:59.769
You gonna be a circus mouse after all.

1:30:00.686 --> 1:30:03.898
You're gonna live in a mouse city
down in Florida.

1:30:08.152 --> 1:30:09.195
Oh, there he goes.

1:30:15.159 --> 1:30:16.702
No!

1:30:17.495 --> 1:30:19.038
[sobbing] Mr. Jingles!

1:30:19.413 --> 1:30:22.166
No! No! No! [crying]

1:30:28.089 --> 1:30:29.257
You kill my mouse.

1:30:29.340 --> 1:30:31.259
I knew I'd get him sooner or later.

1:30:32.051 --> 1:30:33.845
It was just a matter of time, really.

1:30:34.512 --> 1:30:36.806
[Del] You fucking cruel bastard!

1:30:36.889 --> 1:30:38.516
[sobbing]

1:30:46.190 --> 1:30:47.358
[Coffey] Give him to me.

1:30:48.192 --> 1:30:50.695
Give him to me. Might still be time.

1:31:03.666 --> 1:31:05.376
What are you doing?

1:31:06.544 --> 1:31:07.628
Paul?

1:31:08.880 --> 1:31:10.631
What the hell?

1:31:10.715 --> 1:31:12.049
[Del] Please, John.

1:31:13.634 --> 1:31:14.886
Help him.

1:31:16.220 --> 1:31:17.889
Please, Johnny, help him.

1:31:18.806 --> 1:31:20.057
[blowing]

1:31:22.435 --> 1:31:24.145
Oh, dear Jesus.

1:31:24.812 --> 1:31:26.063
The tail.

1:31:26.898 --> 1:31:28.232
Look at the tail.

1:32:00.306 --> 1:32:01.682
[gasps]

1:32:01.766 --> 1:32:03.100
[coughing]

1:32:41.472 --> 1:32:42.807
[squeaking softly]

1:32:47.979 --> 1:32:49.647
[Del sobs]

1:32:51.148 --> 1:32:52.817
[laughing]

1:32:54.151 --> 1:32:55.361
You're back.

1:32:58.656 --> 1:32:59.907
What did you do?

1:33:00.324 --> 1:33:02.493
I helped Del's mouse.

1:33:03.494 --> 1:33:04.912
He's a circus mouse.

1:33:05.496 --> 1:33:08.666
Gonna live in a mouse city down in...

1:33:11.502 --> 1:33:12.712
Florida?

1:33:15.881 --> 1:33:17.508
Boss, Percy bad.

1:33:18.009 --> 1:33:19.427
He mean.

1:33:19.510 --> 1:33:21.095
He step on Del's mouse.

1:33:22.847 --> 1:33:24.765
I took it back, though.

1:33:25.308 --> 1:33:26.600
<i>Merci.</i>

1:33:32.315 --> 1:33:33.816
[Paul] Brute,

1:33:34.275 --> 1:33:35.860
you come along with me.

1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:39.030
You fellas go on back
to your cribbage game.

1:34:03.804 --> 1:34:05.514
Now, don't start in on me.

1:34:06.515 --> 1:34:07.892
It was just a mouse.

1:34:08.893 --> 1:34:10.895
Never belonged here in the first place.

1:34:11.395 --> 1:34:12.813
The mouse is fine.

1:34:13.981 --> 1:34:15.066
Just fine.

1:34:15.149 --> 1:34:17.193
You're no better at mouse-killing
than you are at...

1:34:18.069 --> 1:34:19.862
Hell, at anything else around here.

1:34:20.321 --> 1:34:21.572
[scoffs]

1:34:22.448 --> 1:34:24.742
[Percy] Yeah,
you expect me to believe that? Huh?

1:34:25.368 --> 1:34:26.535
[chuckling]

1:34:26.619 --> 1:34:28.704
I heard the goddamn thing crunch.

1:34:29.372 --> 1:34:31.457
Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay?

1:34:32.792 --> 1:34:34.543
After all those talks we had about

1:34:35.503 --> 1:34:36.962
keeping the prisoners calm?

1:34:37.797 --> 1:34:39.048
Aren't you relieved?

1:34:39.632 --> 1:34:41.008
What kind of game is this?

1:34:41.092 --> 1:34:42.218
It's no game.

1:34:42.968 --> 1:34:44.261
See for yourself.

1:34:47.431 --> 1:34:48.599
Go on.

1:34:58.234 --> 1:35:00.653
[Del speaking indistinctly]

1:35:01.987 --> 1:35:04.240
Don't let nothing happen to Mr. Jingle.

1:35:05.950 --> 1:35:07.827
[footsteps approaching]

1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:10.538
You switched him.

1:35:10.621 --> 1:35:12.456
You switched him somehow, you bastards.

1:35:13.290 --> 1:35:17.420
I always keep a spare mouse in my wallet
for occasions such as this.

1:35:17.503 --> 1:35:20.506
Oh, yeah, you playing with me, huh?
Both of you.

1:35:20.589 --> 1:35:22.633
Just who the hell you think you are, huh?

1:35:22.716 --> 1:35:23.759
Ah!

1:35:25.886 --> 1:35:27.513
[Paul] We're the people
you work with, Percy.

1:35:28.055 --> 1:35:29.348
But not for long.

1:35:29.974 --> 1:35:32.143
-[grunts]
-Percy, I want your word.

1:35:33.269 --> 1:35:34.270
My word?

1:35:34.895 --> 1:35:37.148
I put you out front for Del,

1:35:38.399 --> 1:35:41.569
you put in your transfer
to Briar Ridge the very next day.

1:35:42.611 --> 1:35:46.323
Well, what if I just call up
certain people

1:35:46.824 --> 1:35:48.242
and tell 'em you're harassing me?

1:35:48.993 --> 1:35:51.120
-Bullying me.
-[Paul] Go ahead.

1:35:51.912 --> 1:35:54.832
I promise you'll leave your share
of blood on the floor.

1:35:55.332 --> 1:35:57.501
-Over a mouse?
-No!

1:35:58.461 --> 1:36:00.588
But four men will swear you stood by

1:36:01.130 --> 1:36:03.090
while Wild Bill
tried to strangle Dean to death.

1:36:03.174 --> 1:36:05.509
About that, people will care.
Even your uncle, the governor,

1:36:06.218 --> 1:36:07.261
will care about that.

1:36:07.344 --> 1:36:09.305
Thing like that goes on your work record.

1:36:10.347 --> 1:36:14.310
Work record can follow a man around
for a long, long time.

1:36:14.810 --> 1:36:16.353
[Paul] I put you out front,

1:36:17.062 --> 1:36:18.939
you put in for that transfer.

1:36:21.025 --> 1:36:22.276
That's the deal.

1:36:26.489 --> 1:36:27.823
All right.

1:36:29.241 --> 1:36:30.367
All right.

1:36:37.541 --> 1:36:39.793
You make a promise to a man,
you shake his hand.

1:36:54.433 --> 1:36:56.101
[thunder rumbling]

1:36:57.478 --> 1:36:59.063
[rain pattering]

1:37:03.359 --> 1:37:06.111
[lightning cracking]

1:37:42.439 --> 1:37:43.774
Hey, boys.

1:37:45.442 --> 1:37:48.153
No, now, say, "Hey," Mr. Jingles.

1:37:50.948 --> 1:37:52.950
[Paul] Eduard Delacroix,
will you step forward?

1:37:55.077 --> 1:37:56.412
[thunder rumbling]

1:38:08.048 --> 1:38:09.216
Boss Edgecomb?

1:38:09.967 --> 1:38:11.260
Yes, Del?

1:38:11.677 --> 1:38:14.054
Don't let nothing happen
to Mr. Jingle, okay?

1:38:15.806 --> 1:38:17.891
Here. You take him.

1:38:23.814 --> 1:38:24.982
Del,

1:38:27.318 --> 1:38:29.903
I can't have a mouse
on my shoulder while...

1:38:31.655 --> 1:38:32.948
You know.

1:38:35.075 --> 1:38:36.285
[Coffey] I'll take him, boss.

1:38:37.411 --> 1:38:39.747
Just for now, if Del don't mind.

1:38:42.875 --> 1:38:44.001
Yeah.

1:38:44.752 --> 1:38:46.253
Yeah, you take him, John.

1:38:46.337 --> 1:38:48.631
You take him
till this foolishment be done.

1:39:10.319 --> 1:39:12.237
You gonna take him to Florida,
to that Mouseville?

1:39:13.197 --> 1:39:14.865
We'll do it together, most likely.

1:39:16.700 --> 1:39:18.285
Maybe take a little vacation time.

1:39:19.036 --> 1:39:20.120
Yeah.

1:39:20.204 --> 1:39:22.373
People pay a dime apiece to see him.

1:39:23.374 --> 1:39:25.125
Two cents for the kids.

1:39:25.209 --> 1:39:26.210
Ain't that right, Boss Howell?

1:39:26.293 --> 1:39:27.628
That's right, Del.

1:39:30.255 --> 1:39:31.924
You're a good man, Boss Howell.

1:39:35.594 --> 1:39:36.929
You, too, Boss Edgecomb.

1:39:41.183 --> 1:39:43.852
I sure wish I could've met you guys
somewheres else.

1:39:49.566 --> 1:39:52.444
[speaking French]

1:40:05.958 --> 1:40:07.626
[thunder rumbling]

1:40:23.517 --> 1:40:25.644
Hope he's good and scared.

1:40:25.728 --> 1:40:27.813
Hope he knows the fires are stoked

1:40:27.896 --> 1:40:29.690
and that Satan's imps are waiting.

1:40:39.700 --> 1:40:41.118
Del, it's all right.

1:41:04.224 --> 1:41:05.559
[thunder rumbling]

1:41:24.369 --> 1:41:25.496
Roll on one.

1:41:26.872 --> 1:41:28.373
[electricity humming]

1:41:28.499 --> 1:41:29.833
[whirring]

1:41:37.174 --> 1:41:39.551
[whispering] You be still, Mr. Jingles.

1:41:41.428 --> 1:41:44.348
You be so quiet and so still.

1:41:44.681 --> 1:41:46.141
[lightning cracking]

1:41:48.519 --> 1:41:50.062
Eduard Delacroix,

1:41:50.479 --> 1:41:53.524
you've been condemned to die
by a jury of your peers,

1:41:54.024 --> 1:41:57.736
sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

1:41:58.237 --> 1:42:01.156
You have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

1:42:04.701 --> 1:42:06.328
[sobbing]

1:42:06.829 --> 1:42:08.163
[sniffles]

1:42:09.665 --> 1:42:11.458
I sorry for what I...

1:42:18.799 --> 1:42:20.676
I sorry for what I do.

1:42:21.510 --> 1:42:23.512
I give anything to take it back.

1:42:24.972 --> 1:42:26.390
But I can't.

1:42:27.808 --> 1:42:29.601
God have mercy on me.

1:42:30.727 --> 1:42:32.604
[speaking French] Amen.

1:42:41.321 --> 1:42:42.906
Don't forget about Mouseville.

1:42:45.784 --> 1:42:46.869
Hey,

1:42:48.245 --> 1:42:49.621
there's no such place.

1:42:50.581 --> 1:42:53.584
That's just a fairy tale
these guys told you to keep you quiet.

1:42:54.418 --> 1:42:55.669
[sobbing]

1:42:56.879 --> 1:42:59.464
Just thought you should know, faggot.

1:42:59.548 --> 1:43:01.049
[Del sniffles]

1:43:04.428 --> 1:43:05.846
[lightning cracking]

1:43:13.812 --> 1:43:16.732
[Del praying in French]

1:43:28.952 --> 1:43:31.121
[continues praying in French]

1:43:53.727 --> 1:43:54.770
[clears throat]

1:43:54.978 --> 1:43:56.647
[thunder rumbling]

1:44:01.526 --> 1:44:02.986
Eduard Delacroix,

1:44:03.487 --> 1:44:05.989
electricity shall now be
passed through your body

1:44:06.073 --> 1:44:09.159
until you are dead
in accordance with state law.

1:44:10.994 --> 1:44:13.163
God have mercy on your soul.

1:44:22.714 --> 1:44:24.341
[sobbing]

1:44:27.010 --> 1:44:28.637
[ticking]

1:44:52.327 --> 1:44:53.370
Roll on two!

1:44:54.746 --> 1:44:55.872
[muffled grunting]

1:44:59.126 --> 1:45:00.961
[whooping]

1:45:02.879 --> 1:45:04.214
[screaming]

1:45:10.637 --> 1:45:11.847
[whispers] The sponge is dry.

1:45:12.222 --> 1:45:13.348
What?

1:45:15.225 --> 1:45:17.019
[screaming continues]

1:45:18.729 --> 1:45:20.814
Jack, the goddamn sponge is dry!

1:45:20.897 --> 1:45:22.315
Well, don't you stop it!

1:45:22.399 --> 1:45:24.276
Don't you do it! It's too late for that.

1:45:24.359 --> 1:45:25.736
[screaming]

1:45:40.083 --> 1:45:41.793
Is this normal?

1:45:41.877 --> 1:45:44.004
God, the smell.

1:45:44.087 --> 1:45:45.130
Oh.

1:45:45.756 --> 1:45:47.090
He's cooking now!

1:45:47.174 --> 1:45:48.425
They cooking him good!

1:45:48.884 --> 1:45:50.594
They're about done, I reckon!

1:45:50.927 --> 1:45:52.637
[whooping]

1:45:52.721 --> 1:45:53.889
[exclaims]

1:45:53.972 --> 1:45:55.182
[Wharton] Yeah!

1:45:55.265 --> 1:45:57.392
We're gonna have a hoedown!

1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:00.187
[continues whooping]

1:46:00.270 --> 1:46:02.105
[screaming]

1:46:02.189 --> 1:46:04.816
-[Wharton] Yeah! He's cooking now!
-[crying]

1:46:04.900 --> 1:46:06.610
He's cooking now!

1:46:07.152 --> 1:46:10.781
We gonna have a hoedown! 'Cution gumbo.

1:46:11.406 --> 1:46:12.949
-Give me some!
-[screaming]

1:46:13.617 --> 1:46:16.328
Give me some! I'm smelling gumbo!

1:46:16.787 --> 1:46:19.706
I'm smelling... I said, give me some!

1:46:24.086 --> 1:46:25.462
I smell it!

1:46:27.506 --> 1:46:29.049
-[screaming]
-[Wharton] I smell it!

1:46:29.341 --> 1:46:30.550
-[screaming]
-[whirring]

1:46:36.973 --> 1:46:38.058
Should I kill the juice?

1:46:38.141 --> 1:46:39.768
No! Roll, for chrisssake, roll!

1:46:48.693 --> 1:46:50.946
[all clamoring]

1:47:03.250 --> 1:47:06.211
He's frying now! He's frying now!

1:47:06.586 --> 1:47:08.088
He's frying now!

1:47:09.673 --> 1:47:12.425
-Why don't you shut it down?
-He's still alive.

1:47:12.509 --> 1:47:14.344
You want me to shut down
while he's still alive?

1:47:20.851 --> 1:47:23.103
You watch, you son of a bitch!

1:47:24.855 --> 1:47:27.566
It's all right, folks!
It's all under control!

1:47:28.316 --> 1:47:31.027
Everybody stay calm! Please, stay calm!

1:47:36.825 --> 1:47:37.868
Kill it!

1:47:40.370 --> 1:47:41.538
[machine stops]

1:47:44.875 --> 1:47:45.917
You do it!

1:47:46.001 --> 1:47:47.544
You're running this show, ain't you?

1:47:48.712 --> 1:47:50.547
[clamoring continues]

1:48:15.906 --> 1:48:18.408
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1:48:19.492 --> 1:48:20.869
-[exclaims]
-[Paul] Brutal!

1:48:21.661 --> 1:48:23.079
Brutal, no!

1:48:23.163 --> 1:48:25.332
-No! No!
-What do you mean, "No"?

1:48:25.415 --> 1:48:27.209
How can you say no? You saw what he did!

1:48:27.292 --> 1:48:28.335
Delacroix's dead!

1:48:28.418 --> 1:48:30.420
Now, there's nothing can change that,
and Percy is not worth it!

1:48:30.503 --> 1:48:32.756
So he just gets away with it?
Is that how it works?

1:48:33.215 --> 1:48:35.091
[footsteps approaching]

1:48:41.598 --> 1:48:44.100
What in the blue fuck was that?

1:48:45.936 --> 1:48:47.479
Jesus Christ.

1:48:47.562 --> 1:48:49.648
There's puke all over the floor up there.

1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:51.942
And the smell.

1:48:52.943 --> 1:48:54.694
I got Van Hay to open both doors,

1:48:54.778 --> 1:48:56.947
but that smell won't go out
for five damn years.

1:48:57.030 --> 1:48:58.365
That's what I'm betting.

1:48:59.616 --> 1:49:02.285
And that asshole Wharton
is singing about it!

1:49:03.453 --> 1:49:04.871
You can hear him up there!

1:49:05.497 --> 1:49:07.499
Can he carry a tune, Hal?

1:49:11.962 --> 1:49:13.630
[chuckles]

1:49:18.885 --> 1:49:20.512
Okay, boys, okay.

1:49:21.513 --> 1:49:24.474
Now, what in the hell happened?

1:49:24.766 --> 1:49:25.892
An execution.

1:49:26.476 --> 1:49:27.811
A successful one.

1:49:28.144 --> 1:49:32.065
How in the name of Christ
can you call that a success?

1:49:33.066 --> 1:49:35.151
Eduard Delacroix is dead.

1:49:36.820 --> 1:49:38.113
Isn't he?

1:49:42.617 --> 1:49:44.411
-Percy?
-Yeah.

1:49:45.161 --> 1:49:46.454
Something to say?

1:49:50.333 --> 1:49:52.836
I didn't know the sponge
is supposed to be wet.

1:49:54.254 --> 1:49:56.965
How many years you spend
pissing on a toilet seat

1:49:57.173 --> 1:49:58.925
before someone told you to put it up?

1:49:59.009 --> 1:50:00.844
Percy fucked up, Hal.

1:50:01.469 --> 1:50:02.721
Pure and simple.

1:50:03.513 --> 1:50:05.598
That's your official position?

1:50:05.682 --> 1:50:07.017
Don't you think it should be?

1:50:08.018 --> 1:50:11.062
He's putting in for a transfer request
to Briar Ridge tomorrow.

1:50:12.188 --> 1:50:14.065
Moving on to bigger and better things.

1:50:15.025 --> 1:50:16.109
Isn't that right, Percy?

1:50:18.028 --> 1:50:19.446
Yeah. Yeah.

1:50:19.571 --> 1:50:22.782

Whoo!

1:50:43.678 --> 1:50:45.096
You're about ten seconds away

1:50:45.180 --> 1:50:47.098
from spending the rest of your life
in the padded room.

1:50:56.775 --> 1:50:58.443

Poor old Del.

1:51:08.953 --> 1:51:10.080
Yeah.

1:51:11.039 --> 1:51:12.499
Poor old Del.

1:51:15.001 --> 1:51:16.086
John?

1:51:18.755 --> 1:51:20.006
You okay?

1:51:21.466 --> 1:51:23.510
I could feel it from here.

1:51:24.344 --> 1:51:25.970
What do you mean?

1:51:26.638 --> 1:51:27.806
You could hear it.

1:51:28.473 --> 1:51:30.016
Is that what you mean?

1:51:30.100 --> 1:51:33.103
-You could hear it.
-He out of it now, though.

1:51:33.770 --> 1:51:35.105
He the lucky one.

1:51:36.147 --> 1:51:38.191
No matter how it happened,

1:51:38.274 --> 1:51:39.943
Del the lucky one.

1:51:41.277 --> 1:51:42.445
[sobs]

1:51:46.533 --> 1:51:48.284
Where's Mr. Jingles?

1:51:49.661 --> 1:51:51.788
He run away under that door.

1:51:53.540 --> 1:51:55.583
Don't think he'll be back.

1:51:57.168 --> 1:51:59.629
He felt it too, through me.

1:52:01.172 --> 1:52:03.383
Didn't mean to hurt him none.

1:52:03.925 --> 1:52:06.469
All that hurt just spill out.

1:52:09.139 --> 1:52:10.390
[sniffles]

1:52:10.473 --> 1:52:11.641

1:52:13.643 --> 1:52:15.520
Awful tired now, boss.

1:52:17.814 --> 1:52:19.149
Dog-tired.

1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:27.115
[softly] Me too, John.

1:52:27.198 --> 1:52:29.492
[Coffey sobbing softly]

1:52:29.576 --> 1:52:30.827
Me, too.

1:53:30.929 --> 1:53:32.347
I hate this.

1:53:33.264 --> 1:53:34.474
I know.

1:53:49.572 --> 1:53:51.991
[Jan] Melinda, hi.

1:53:56.246 --> 1:53:58.498
-I am so happy to see you.
-Oh.

1:53:59.958 --> 1:54:01.376
Look at you.

1:54:02.710 --> 1:54:04.587
Well, we missed you at church.

1:54:07.090 --> 1:54:08.424
Oh!

1:54:08.508 --> 1:54:10.426
Ah, my hair.

1:54:11.094 --> 1:54:12.178
You look fine.

1:54:12.262 --> 1:54:13.846
I'm just a mess.

1:54:16.766 --> 1:54:18.101
[sizzling]

1:54:19.310 --> 1:54:21.771
She's having one of her good days.

1:54:22.355 --> 1:54:24.148
I thank God for that.

1:54:26.609 --> 1:54:28.278
What's a bad day?

1:54:31.864 --> 1:54:33.533
Sometimes she's...

1:54:35.118 --> 1:54:36.494
She's not herself anymore.

1:54:37.120 --> 1:54:38.454
She swears.

1:54:38.955 --> 1:54:40.290
She swears?

1:54:40.373 --> 1:54:42.000
It just pops out.

1:54:42.792 --> 1:54:44.836
Most awful language you can imagine.

1:54:45.545 --> 1:54:47.630
She doesn't even know she's doing it.

1:54:49.257 --> 1:54:51.342
I didn't know
she'd ever heard words like that.

1:54:52.260 --> 1:54:54.971
To hear her say them in her sweet voice.

1:54:59.809 --> 1:55:01.603
I'm glad she's having a good day, Paul.

1:55:03.438 --> 1:55:05.440
I'm glad for you and Jan.

1:55:21.789 --> 1:55:23.082
Honey,

1:55:23.166 --> 1:55:25.919
if you don't tell me what's on your mind,

1:55:26.586 --> 1:55:29.172
I'm afraid I'll have to
smother you with a pillow.

1:55:38.848 --> 1:55:40.642
I'm thinking I love you.

1:55:42.894 --> 1:55:45.605
I'm thinking I don't know
what I would do if you were gone.

1:55:48.441 --> 1:55:49.484
Oh.

1:55:52.612 --> 1:55:55.615
I'm also thinking I'm gonna
have the boys over tomorrow.

1:56:00.203 --> 1:56:02.956
Well, you sure do know
how to cook chicken.

1:56:03.039 --> 1:56:04.457
Well, thank you.

1:56:04.540 --> 1:56:07.335
This is one delicious treat, ma'am,
before I go to work.

1:56:07.418 --> 1:56:08.962
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying it.

1:56:09.462 --> 1:56:10.630
-Hey, Brutal.
-Hmm.

1:56:10.713 --> 1:56:11.881
You gonna hog all them taters?

1:56:11.965 --> 1:56:13.132
Yes, I am.

1:56:13.883 --> 1:56:15.760
-Harry, you want some taters?
-Come on, now.

1:56:16.052 --> 1:56:17.095
What?

1:56:17.178 --> 1:56:19.973
[Jan] Very soon we'll just see your feet
sticking out of there, Brutus.

1:56:20.056 --> 1:56:21.557
Y'all saw what he did to the mouse.

1:56:25.353 --> 1:56:27.647
I could've gone the rest of the day
without you bringing that up.

1:56:27.730 --> 1:56:29.399
I could've gone the rest of the year.

1:56:29.983 --> 1:56:31.484
He did the same thing to me.

1:56:32.276 --> 1:56:33.861
He put his hands on me.

1:56:35.196 --> 1:56:36.906
He took my bladder infection away.

1:56:42.078 --> 1:56:45.164
It's true.
When he came home that day, he was

1:56:47.125 --> 1:56:48.626
all better.

1:56:50.003 --> 1:56:54.173
Oh, now, wait. You're talking about
an authentic healing?

1:56:56.217 --> 1:56:57.635
A praise-Jesus miracle?

1:56:58.594 --> 1:56:59.595
I am.

1:57:00.471 --> 1:57:01.597
Oh, yeah.

1:57:02.098 --> 1:57:04.600
Well, if you say it, I accept it.

1:57:06.185 --> 1:57:07.437
What's it got to do with us?

1:57:08.479 --> 1:57:09.772
You're thinking about Melinda.

1:57:10.273 --> 1:57:11.315
Melinda?

1:57:12.275 --> 1:57:15.028
-Melinda Moores?
-Yeah. So, Paul,

1:57:15.111 --> 1:57:16.821
you really think you can help her?

1:57:17.613 --> 1:57:19.198
It's not a bladder infection

1:57:19.574 --> 1:57:21.451
or even a busted mouse,

1:57:22.869 --> 1:57:23.995
but I think there might be a chance.

1:57:24.412 --> 1:57:25.872
Hold on now.

1:57:25.955 --> 1:57:27.957
You're talking about our jobs.

1:57:28.041 --> 1:57:30.334
Sneak a sick woman into a cellblock?

1:57:30.418 --> 1:57:32.462
Oh, no. No, no.
Hal would never stand for that.

1:57:33.504 --> 1:57:34.422
You know him.

1:57:34.505 --> 1:57:36.132
He wouldn't believe anything
even if it fell on him.

1:57:36.215 --> 1:57:37.467
So you're talking about

1:57:38.426 --> 1:57:39.844
taking John Coffey to her.

1:57:45.641 --> 1:57:47.643
That's more than just our jobs, Paul.

1:57:49.020 --> 1:57:50.480
That's prison time, we get caught.

1:57:50.563 --> 1:57:51.898
You're dang right, it is.

1:57:51.981 --> 1:57:53.858
[Paul] No, not for you, Dean.

1:57:53.941 --> 1:57:57.195
See now, the way I figure it,
you stay back on the Mile.

1:57:57.278 --> 1:57:58.780
That way, you can deny everything.

1:57:59.739 --> 1:58:01.115
Why do I have to stay behind?

1:58:02.033 --> 1:58:04.786
Well, our boy's grown up,

1:58:05.411 --> 1:58:06.913
gone off to school.

1:58:06.996 --> 1:58:09.082
Harry's girls, they're all married now.

1:58:09.957 --> 1:58:11.042
Brutal's a single man.

1:58:11.125 --> 1:58:14.337
You're the only one here
with two children, another one on the way.

1:58:15.171 --> 1:58:18.091
Let's not discuss this
as if we're thinking of doing it.

1:58:20.510 --> 1:58:22.762
Brutal, help me out here.

1:58:24.514 --> 1:58:27.683
-I'm sure she's a fine woman.
-The finest.

1:58:28.101 --> 1:58:30.603
What is happening to her
is an offense, Brutal.

1:58:30.686 --> 1:58:33.147
To the eye and the ear and to the heart.

1:58:33.231 --> 1:58:34.857
I have no doubt.

1:58:36.400 --> 1:58:38.486
But we don't know her
like you and Jan do, do we?

1:58:38.820 --> 1:58:41.572
And let's not forget,
John Coffey is a murderer.

1:58:43.074 --> 1:58:44.659
Now, what if he escapes?

1:58:45.201 --> 1:58:48.121
I'd hate to lose my job or go to prison,

1:58:48.830 --> 1:58:52.041
but I'd hate worse to have
a dead child on my conscience.

1:58:52.125 --> 1:58:53.417
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1:58:55.795 --> 1:58:57.046
In fact,

1:58:59.590 --> 1:59:01.259
I don't think he did it at all.

1:59:04.720 --> 1:59:06.097
I do not see

1:59:06.681 --> 1:59:10.601
God putting a gift like that
in the hands of a man who'd kill a child.

1:59:11.102 --> 1:59:14.772
Well, that's a very tender notion,
but the man is on death row for the crime.

1:59:17.275 --> 1:59:18.317
And plus,

1:59:18.734 --> 1:59:20.403
he's huge.

1:59:20.903 --> 1:59:22.572
If he tried to get away,

1:59:24.198 --> 1:59:25.616
it'd take a lot of bullets to stop him.

1:59:26.033 --> 1:59:27.618
Oh, we'd all have shotguns,

1:59:28.035 --> 1:59:29.495
in addition to side arms.

1:59:30.538 --> 1:59:31.747
I'd insist on that.

1:59:33.082 --> 1:59:35.877
If he tried anything, anything at all,

1:59:36.419 --> 1:59:37.920
we'd have to take him down.

1:59:39.005 --> 1:59:40.006
You understand?

1:59:51.934 --> 1:59:53.060
So,

1:59:53.936 --> 1:59:55.188
tell us what you had in mind.

2:00:02.945 --> 2:00:04.989
[Paul] Oh, there it is.
[Brutal] Oh, I see it.

2:00:05.072 --> 2:00:07.158
[cabinet door opens]

2:00:16.417 --> 2:00:18.085
You think this is enough?

2:00:19.587 --> 2:00:21.047
I don't know.

2:00:57.875 --> 2:00:59.752
You fellas thirsty?

2:00:59.835 --> 2:01:01.504
Fresh out of the icebox.

2:01:01.587 --> 2:01:03.923
You bet. That's swell, Brutal. Thanks.

2:01:04.006 --> 2:01:05.299
[Brutal] Oh, yeah.

2:01:05.383 --> 2:01:07.718
[Harry] Hot in here. Boy, howdy.

2:01:07.802 --> 2:01:10.680
Hey, hey.
I'm gonna get some, too, ain't I?

2:01:11.180 --> 2:01:12.848
My ass, you get some, too.

2:01:12.932 --> 2:01:14.517
What makes you think you deserve any?

2:01:15.351 --> 2:01:17.144
Because I got a big pecker.

2:01:17.728 --> 2:01:20.106
Well, the day report says he's been okay.

2:01:20.898 --> 2:01:23.484
[Wharton] Hell, yeah, I been behaved.
Come on, now.

2:01:23.943 --> 2:01:25.278
Don't be stingy hogs.

2:01:28.531 --> 2:01:29.657
[Wharton] Come on.

2:01:30.491 --> 2:01:32.702
Come on. Come on now, fellers.

2:01:34.245 --> 2:01:35.538
Come on, boss.

2:01:35.871 --> 2:01:37.665
I been good all day.

2:01:40.793 --> 2:01:42.211
It's hot in here.

2:01:42.753 --> 2:01:45.881
It's hot in this cell,
and I'm dogged to drink. I'm thirsty.

2:01:46.382 --> 2:01:48.175
Why don't you give me some?

2:01:55.057 --> 2:01:56.267
Come on.

2:02:01.564 --> 2:02:02.732
You gonna stay behaved?

2:02:03.607 --> 2:02:05.192
Come on, you clunk, give me that.

2:02:05.443 --> 2:02:06.652
You promise me,

2:02:07.528 --> 2:02:09.405
or else I'll drink this myself
right here in front of you.

2:02:09.822 --> 2:02:12.283
Don't, don't, don't...
Come on, now. Don't be that way.

2:02:13.075 --> 2:02:14.201
I'll be good.

2:02:34.180 --> 2:02:35.514
[belching]

2:02:39.393 --> 2:02:40.436
Cup.

2:03:20.976 --> 2:03:22.853
[footsteps approaching]

2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:33.406
Anybody wants out, now's the time.

2:03:34.490 --> 2:03:35.991
After this, there's no turning back.

2:03:37.827 --> 2:03:38.828
So?

2:03:39.995 --> 2:03:41.497
We gonna do this?

2:03:41.580 --> 2:03:44.333
[Coffey] Sure. That'd be just fine.

2:03:44.834 --> 2:03:46.460
I'd like to take a ride.

2:03:52.216 --> 2:03:53.717
Guess we're all in.

2:04:05.521 --> 2:04:06.647
What is this?

2:04:09.066 --> 2:04:10.151
Payback.

2:04:10.484 --> 2:04:11.527
[Brutal] That's right.

2:04:13.237 --> 2:04:14.572
[grunting]

2:04:16.532 --> 2:04:17.950
No, you let me go!

2:04:18.033 --> 2:04:19.452
-Let go of me!
-Settle down.

2:04:19.535 --> 2:04:20.703
-Let go!
-Settle down.

2:04:20.786 --> 2:04:22.496
-What are you doing?
-Settle down.

2:04:29.545 --> 2:04:30.754
Oh!

2:04:31.380 --> 2:04:33.924
-"Miss Lotta Leadpipe."
-[Brutal] Oh, Percy.

2:04:34.258 --> 2:04:35.426
What would your mother say?

2:04:35.509 --> 2:04:37.636
You let go of me, you ignoramus.

2:04:37.720 --> 2:04:40.556
I know people. Big people!

2:04:40.973 --> 2:04:43.726
Percy, stick out your arms
like a good lad.

2:04:44.101 --> 2:04:46.479
No, I won't do it. You can't make me.

2:04:46.562 --> 2:04:48.314
Oh, you're dead wrong about that,
you know.

2:04:49.231 --> 2:04:50.524
[screaming]

2:04:54.737 --> 2:04:57.072
You gonna put your arms up, huh?

2:04:57.865 --> 2:05:01.035
A big man is ripping your ears off, Percy.
I'd do as he says.

2:05:01.118 --> 2:05:02.828
[screaming]

2:05:03.162 --> 2:05:04.413
There you go.

2:05:08.626 --> 2:05:10.252
[panting]

2:05:13.130 --> 2:05:14.298
Please, Paul.

2:05:14.798 --> 2:05:16.926
Please don't put me in with Wild Bill.

2:05:17.009 --> 2:05:18.469
Please don't.

2:05:19.678 --> 2:05:21.013
You would think that.

2:05:23.474 --> 2:05:25.935
No, no, no, you can't do this to me.

2:05:26.018 --> 2:05:28.521
You can't do this to me. You can't.

2:05:29.063 --> 2:05:31.106
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, Percy.

2:05:31.190 --> 2:05:33.359
We can and we are.

2:05:33.442 --> 2:05:35.110
[muffled sobbing]

2:05:40.950 --> 2:05:42.701
We'll give you a few hours
of quiet time, Percy,

2:05:42.785 --> 2:05:45.871
so you can reflect on what you did to Del.

2:05:45.955 --> 2:05:49.041
And if you get lonely,
just think about Miss Leadpipe.

2:05:51.168 --> 2:05:52.962
[muffled protesting]

2:05:58.551 --> 2:06:00.803
All right, let's go over it one more time.

2:06:00.886 --> 2:06:02.596
What do you say if somebody stops by?

2:06:04.848 --> 2:06:06.559
Coffey got upset just after lights out,

2:06:06.642 --> 2:06:09.436
so we put the coat on him,
locked him in the restraint room.

2:06:10.312 --> 2:06:12.273
They hear any kicking and fussing,
they'll think it's him.

2:06:12.356 --> 2:06:13.440
What about me?

2:06:13.524 --> 2:06:15.359
You're down in Admin pulling Del's file,

2:06:15.442 --> 2:06:18.821
going over the witnesses on account of
how big a screw-up the execution was.

2:06:21.824 --> 2:06:23.409
We going for the ride now?

2:06:23.826 --> 2:06:25.661
That's right. We going for the ride.

2:06:28.455 --> 2:06:30.124
What about us, Dean?

2:06:30.207 --> 2:06:34.086
You, Harry, Percy, all down in the laundry
doing your wash.

2:06:34.169 --> 2:06:35.921
Probably take y'all a few hours
before you're back.

2:06:36.880 --> 2:06:38.340
[gasping]

2:06:40.342 --> 2:06:41.719
Where you think you going?

2:06:42.344 --> 2:06:43.637
[sobbing]

2:06:48.767 --> 2:06:50.269
You a bad man.

2:06:50.644 --> 2:06:52.855
That's right, nigger. Bad as you'd want.

2:06:52.938 --> 2:06:55.316
[Coffey breathing heavily]

2:07:00.654 --> 2:07:03.824
What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?

2:07:03.907 --> 2:07:05.576
[Wharton laughing]

2:07:20.466 --> 2:07:22.051
[exhales]

2:07:24.386 --> 2:07:25.721
[whooping]

2:07:28.223 --> 2:07:30.726
Whole room... Whole room's spinning.

2:07:31.685 --> 2:07:33.479
It's like I'm shitty-ass drunk.

2:07:34.063 --> 2:07:35.939
Had me some shine or...

2:07:37.191 --> 2:07:38.400
Or what?

2:07:40.903 --> 2:07:43.656
Niggers ought to have
their own electric chair.

2:07:43.739 --> 2:07:44.948
White man

2:07:45.574 --> 2:07:48.118
ought not to have to sit
in no nigger electric chair.

2:07:48.952 --> 2:07:50.204
No, sir.

2:07:52.539 --> 2:07:53.791
[snoring]

2:07:57.378 --> 2:07:59.463
He a bad man.

2:08:01.423 --> 2:08:02.925
[door opening]

2:08:19.650 --> 2:08:20.776
Look, boss.

2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:27.950
It's Cassie,
the lady in the rocking chair.

2:08:28.033 --> 2:08:30.494
[whispering] Shh! John,
we have to be quiet now.

2:08:31.120 --> 2:08:33.497
[whispering] You see her?
You see the lady?

2:08:33.580 --> 2:08:35.290
[Brutal] Yeah, we see her, John. Come on.

2:08:47.302 --> 2:08:49.221
[Paul] Let's go. Go, go!

2:08:53.392 --> 2:08:54.685
Now!

2:09:12.286 --> 2:09:13.912
[inhales]

2:09:30.679 --> 2:09:32.806
All right, big boy.
Let's get moving. Come on.

2:10:07.341 --> 2:10:09.426
-[Paul] Upsy-daisy.
-[grunts]

2:10:12.679 --> 2:10:14.306
[engine starting]

2:10:16.934 --> 2:10:18.060
John,

2:10:18.602 --> 2:10:20.187
do you know where
we're taking you tonight?

2:10:23.941 --> 2:10:25.108
Help a lady?

2:10:27.319 --> 2:10:28.529
[Brutal] That's right.

2:10:29.738 --> 2:10:30.781
But how do you know?

2:10:32.574 --> 2:10:33.951
Don't know.

2:10:35.911 --> 2:10:37.079
Tell the truth, boss,

2:10:38.038 --> 2:10:39.623
I don't know much of anything.

2:10:41.708 --> 2:10:42.960
I never have.

2:10:45.754 --> 2:10:47.005
[knocks]

2:11:11.196 --> 2:11:12.698
[engine stops]

2:11:18.287 --> 2:11:19.830
We can still turn back.

2:11:22.124 --> 2:11:24.793
Boss, look. Someone's up.

2:11:24.877 --> 2:11:26.086
[sighs]

2:11:26.962 --> 2:11:28.338
This was a mistake.

2:11:29.256 --> 2:11:31.341
Oh, Christ, Paul, what were we thinking?

2:11:31.425 --> 2:11:33.844
It's too late now. John, you stay.

2:11:38.891 --> 2:11:41.476
Harry, you keep John here
till we call you.

2:11:52.112 --> 2:11:54.740
Who the hell goes there at 2:30
in the goddamn morning?

2:11:54.823 --> 2:11:56.950
[stammering] Hal, it's us.
It's Paul and Brutal.

2:11:57.409 --> 2:11:58.994
-It's us.
-Jesus.

2:11:59.077 --> 2:12:01.580
It isn't a lockdown, is it? Or a riot?

2:12:01.663 --> 2:12:05.125
[Paul] No. Hal, for God's sakes,
just take your finger off the trigger.

2:12:05.208 --> 2:12:06.335
[Hal] Are you hostages?

2:12:07.502 --> 2:12:09.212
Who's out there?

2:12:09.296 --> 2:12:11.381
-Who's by that truck?
-Harry, the lights!

2:12:15.677 --> 2:12:17.095
John Coffey.

2:12:18.096 --> 2:12:19.389
-Halt!
-[Paul] Hal.

2:12:19.473 --> 2:12:22.059
-[Hal] You stay right where you are!
-[Paul] Relax, now. Take it easy, now.

2:12:22.142 --> 2:12:23.727
-[Hal] Don't you move!
-Wait!

2:12:23.810 --> 2:12:25.020
-[Hal] I'm warning you.
-John, wait!

2:12:25.103 --> 2:12:27.147
-[Paul] Hal, listen!
-Halt right there or I'll shoot!

2:12:27.230 --> 2:12:28.941
-[Hal] I said, halt!
-[Paul] Hal, put the gun down!

2:12:29.024 --> 2:12:30.150
-Halt!
-Hal.

2:12:30.233 --> 2:12:31.443
[Melinda] Hal!

2:12:33.528 --> 2:12:34.571
Hal!

2:12:34.905 --> 2:12:37.157
Who you talking to down there?

2:12:37.699 --> 2:12:39.034
God damn it!

2:12:39.117 --> 2:12:41.119
Hal, now, nobody is hurt.

2:12:42.245 --> 2:12:43.455
And we are here to help.

2:12:43.538 --> 2:12:44.873
Help what?

2:12:45.624 --> 2:12:46.833
I don't understand.

2:12:46.917 --> 2:12:49.336
-You're just gonna have to trust me.
-[Melinda sobbing]

2:13:06.478 --> 2:13:07.604
What do you want?

2:13:08.063 --> 2:13:09.523
[Melinda] Hal!

2:13:10.607 --> 2:13:12.609
Make them go away!

2:13:13.610 --> 2:13:16.279
I don't want no salesmen

2:13:17.030 --> 2:13:19.116
in the middle of the night.

2:13:19.908 --> 2:13:23.912
Tell them to take
a flying fuck at a rolling...

2:13:23.996 --> 2:13:25.288
[Coffey] Just to help.

2:13:25.872 --> 2:13:28.250
Just to help, boss. That's all.

2:13:29.418 --> 2:13:30.752
You can't.

2:13:31.420 --> 2:13:32.587
No one can.

2:13:38.844 --> 2:13:40.929
[Melinda continues sobbing]

2:13:44.057 --> 2:13:46.435
-[Melinda] Stay out of here!
-Don't you go in there!

2:13:46.768 --> 2:13:49.229
[Melinda] Whoever you are, just stay out!
[Hal] Don't you do it!

2:13:50.230 --> 2:13:52.649
[Melinda] I'm not dressed for visitors.

2:13:54.568 --> 2:13:56.945
You stop now. You hear me?

2:13:57.696 --> 2:13:59.364
Paul, I don't want him up there.

2:13:59.448 --> 2:14:02.242
Boss, you just be quiet now.

2:14:04.786 --> 2:14:06.913
[Melinda moans]

2:14:50.832 --> 2:14:53.251
It's all right, Hal. It's all right.

2:14:53.335 --> 2:14:55.629
[whispering] Hal, watch. Just watch him.

2:15:02.010 --> 2:15:04.554
Don't come near me, pig fucker.

2:15:18.527 --> 2:15:21.404
Why do you have so many scars?

2:15:23.698 --> 2:15:26.409
Who hurt you so badly, huh?

2:15:27.536 --> 2:15:29.704
Don't hardly remember, ma'am.

2:15:32.415 --> 2:15:34.376
What's your name, huh?

2:15:34.459 --> 2:15:37.295
John Coffey, ma'am. Like the drink.

2:15:38.171 --> 2:15:40.132
Only not spelt the same.

2:15:47.180 --> 2:15:48.348
Ma'am?

2:15:48.849 --> 2:15:50.559
[breathing heavily]

2:15:56.106 --> 2:15:58.233
[hoarsely] Yes, John Coffey?

2:15:59.860 --> 2:16:01.111
I see it.

2:16:02.112 --> 2:16:03.405
-[sobbing]
-I see it.

2:16:10.579 --> 2:16:12.831
What's happening?

2:16:13.999 --> 2:16:19.087
Shh, you be still now.
You be so quiet and so still.

2:16:47.199 --> 2:16:49.159
[inhaling]

2:16:53.413 --> 2:16:54.748
[rumbling]

2:16:59.794 --> 2:17:01.046
[ticking]

2:17:07.219 --> 2:17:08.762
[loud rumbling]

2:17:34.329 --> 2:17:36.164
[coughing]

2:17:45.507 --> 2:17:47.842
Come on, John. Sick it up.

2:17:47.926 --> 2:17:50.345
[patting] Come on.
Cough it out like you done before.

2:17:51.972 --> 2:17:55.600
He's choking. Whatever he sucked
out of her, he's choking on it.

2:17:56.309 --> 2:17:57.394
John.

2:17:59.062 --> 2:18:01.606
I'll be fine. Just let me be.

2:18:15.203 --> 2:18:16.496
[hoarsely] How did I get here?

2:18:19.291 --> 2:18:24.045
We... We were going
to the hospital in Vicksburg.

2:18:24.587 --> 2:18:28.049
-Remember?
-Shh... [sniffles] Melly.

2:18:28.800 --> 2:18:33.096
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter anymore.

2:18:33.179 --> 2:18:34.973
Did I have the X-ray?

2:18:36.266 --> 2:18:37.434
Did I?

2:18:40.562 --> 2:18:41.896
[Paul] Yes.

2:18:42.689 --> 2:18:45.442
Yes. It was clear.

2:18:45.525 --> 2:18:46.776
There was no tumor.

2:18:46.860 --> 2:18:48.445
[sobbing]

2:18:51.614 --> 2:18:52.657
Oh.

2:18:53.950 --> 2:18:55.577
[whispering] Hal.

2:19:02.751 --> 2:19:07.380
John, can you stand up?
Can you turn around and see this lady?

2:19:09.049 --> 2:19:10.383
[grunting]

2:19:14.596 --> 2:19:16.348
[coughing]

2:19:20.435 --> 2:19:22.062
What's your name?

2:19:23.438 --> 2:19:25.148
John Coffey, ma'am.

2:19:26.858 --> 2:19:28.401
Like the drink.

2:19:30.028 --> 2:19:31.988
Only not spelt the same.

2:19:32.530 --> 2:19:35.784
No, ma'am, not spelt the same at all.

2:19:39.204 --> 2:19:41.956
Melly. No, you can't.

2:20:07.148 --> 2:20:08.817
I dreamed of you.

2:20:12.070 --> 2:20:14.864
I dreamed you were wandering in the dark.

2:20:16.324 --> 2:20:17.826
And so was I.

2:20:20.036 --> 2:20:22.163
And we found each other.

2:20:23.331 --> 2:20:25.834
We found each other in the dark.

2:20:45.437 --> 2:20:47.021
Take it, John. It's a present.

2:20:47.605 --> 2:20:49.399
It's St. Christopher.

2:20:50.859 --> 2:20:52.986
I want you to have it, Mr. Coffey.

2:20:54.028 --> 2:20:56.072
And wear it. He'll keep you safe.

2:20:56.865 --> 2:21:00.034
Please. Wear it for me.

2:21:11.212 --> 2:21:12.547
[coughing]

2:21:15.467 --> 2:21:16.759
[hoarsely] Thank you, ma'am.

2:21:18.803 --> 2:21:20.388
Thank you, John.

2:21:27.645 --> 2:21:29.689
Christ, he goes down,

2:21:29.772 --> 2:21:31.900
it'll take three mules and a crane
to pick him up again.

2:21:32.358 --> 2:21:35.653
Take it easy, John. Come on, now.
You gotta stay on your feet.

2:21:35.737 --> 2:21:37.071
[coughing]

2:21:51.753 --> 2:21:54.422
He'll never sit in Old Sparky.
You know that, don't you?

2:21:55.381 --> 2:21:57.592
He swallowed that stuff for a reason.

2:21:58.259 --> 2:22:00.678
I give him a few days.

2:22:00.762 --> 2:22:03.223
One of us will be doing a cell check,
and there he'll be,

2:22:03.306 --> 2:22:04.516
dead on his bunk.

2:22:04.599 --> 2:22:07.185
Well, if that's his choice,
he's earned it.

2:22:07.268 --> 2:22:09.145
Let's just get him back on the Mile.

2:22:12.565 --> 2:22:14.526
[Coffey coughing]

2:22:15.109 --> 2:22:16.444
[grunting]

2:22:20.907 --> 2:22:23.243
[breathing heavily]

2:22:23.326 --> 2:22:25.203
Oh, boy, am I happy to see you fellows.

2:22:25.286 --> 2:22:28.414
You were gone so long, Wild Bill's making
noise like he's gonna wake up.

2:22:28.498 --> 2:22:29.499
What the hell happened to him?

2:22:29.832 --> 2:22:32.460
He's hurting, Dean. He's hurting bad.

2:22:36.381 --> 2:22:38.299
Okay, John.

2:22:38.383 --> 2:22:41.844
We gonna set you down on your bed now.

2:22:41.928 --> 2:22:43.263
Here we go.

2:22:43.346 --> 2:22:45.139
[continues coughing]

2:23:01.406 --> 2:23:02.490
Well?

2:23:04.534 --> 2:23:06.452
What about Mrs. Moores?

2:23:08.580 --> 2:23:10.456
Was it like the mouse?

2:23:11.666 --> 2:23:12.959
Was it,

2:23:14.877 --> 2:23:17.338
you know, a miracle?

2:23:17.922 --> 2:23:19.132
Yes.

2:23:20.466 --> 2:23:22.218
Yes, it was.

2:23:23.261 --> 2:23:24.429
Damn.

2:23:24.971 --> 2:23:26.472
[door opening]

2:23:40.069 --> 2:23:41.321
Now,

2:23:41.863 --> 2:23:44.782
I want to talk, not shout.

2:23:44.866 --> 2:23:47.577
I take that tape off, you gonna be calm?

2:23:47.660 --> 2:23:48.870
Mmm-hmm.

2:23:50.580 --> 2:23:53.374
My mother always says you do it fast,
it won't hurt so much.

2:23:53.875 --> 2:23:55.835
[muffled protest]

2:23:57.211 --> 2:23:58.963
Guess she was wrong.

2:24:00.340 --> 2:24:01.549
[coughs]

2:24:02.383 --> 2:24:03.801
Let me out of this nut-coat.

2:24:03.885 --> 2:24:06.179
-In a minute.
-Now! Right now!

2:24:06.262 --> 2:24:08.806
I want out now... [exclaims]

2:24:10.475 --> 2:24:11.684
[grunts]

2:24:11.768 --> 2:24:13.519
Shut up and listen.

2:24:14.729 --> 2:24:17.106
Now you deserved to be punished
for what you did to Del.

2:24:17.190 --> 2:24:18.358
You accept it like a man.

2:24:19.233 --> 2:24:21.319
Or else we'll make you sorry
you were ever born.

2:24:22.195 --> 2:24:25.323
We'll tell people
how you sabotaged Del's execution...

2:24:25.406 --> 2:24:26.741
Sabotaged?

2:24:26.824 --> 2:24:28.743
How you pissed yourself
like a frightened little girl.

2:24:28.826 --> 2:24:31.037
Ooh, yes. Yeah, we will talk.

2:24:32.288 --> 2:24:33.748
But, Percy,

2:24:34.248 --> 2:24:35.917
you mind me, now.

2:24:36.918 --> 2:24:40.380
We'll also see you beaten
within an inch of your life.

2:24:42.423 --> 2:24:43.675
We know people, too.

2:24:45.259 --> 2:24:47.428
Are you so foolish,
you don't realize that?

2:24:49.972 --> 2:24:52.767
Let bygones be bygones, hmm?

2:24:54.143 --> 2:24:57.063
Nothing's hurt so far but your pride.

2:24:57.146 --> 2:25:01.234
No one ever need know about that,
except the people in this little room.

2:25:01.776 --> 2:25:04.654
What happens on the Mile
stays on the Mile.

2:25:06.239 --> 2:25:07.615
Always has.

2:25:12.120 --> 2:25:13.496
Hmm.

2:25:16.916 --> 2:25:19.335
May I be let out of this coat now?

2:25:39.272 --> 2:25:40.356
My things?

2:25:43.609 --> 2:25:45.403
Think it over, Percy.

2:25:46.487 --> 2:25:48.114
Oh, I intend to.

2:25:49.282 --> 2:25:52.160
I intend to think it over very hard.

2:25:53.911 --> 2:25:55.663
Starting right now.

2:26:05.548 --> 2:26:08.676
He'll talk. Sooner or later.

2:26:09.177 --> 2:26:10.261
Hmm.

2:26:18.644 --> 2:26:19.854
[gasps]

2:26:23.316 --> 2:26:25.651
-Hey, let him go!
-John, let go!

2:26:25.735 --> 2:26:28.571
-Let go, John!
-John, God damn it! Let him go!

2:26:28.654 --> 2:26:29.781
Let go, John! No!

2:26:29.864 --> 2:26:31.115
[screaming]

2:26:31.199 --> 2:26:32.742
[Paul] Back off!

2:26:33.743 --> 2:26:36.287
John, stop it! Stop it, John!

2:26:36.370 --> 2:26:38.456
-Let him go! Back off!
-John, let him go!

2:26:40.541 --> 2:26:41.793

2:27:34.887 --> 2:27:36.097
[grunts]

2:27:39.267 --> 2:27:41.811
Easy, now. Easy.

2:27:43.604 --> 2:27:44.939
Easy. Hey.

2:27:46.107 --> 2:27:47.149
Hey.

2:27:51.237 --> 2:27:52.405
Percy.

2:27:55.533 --> 2:27:57.201
Are you all right?

2:28:29.817 --> 2:28:31.485
Boy, what you looking at?

2:28:39.619 --> 2:28:43.247
What you looking at? You limp noodle.

2:28:43.789 --> 2:28:45.625
You wanna kiss my ass?

2:28:46.459 --> 2:28:47.877
You wanna suck my dick?

2:28:55.885 --> 2:28:56.886
[holster opening]

2:28:58.471 --> 2:28:59.889
[gunshots]

2:28:59.972 --> 2:29:01.098
[all] No!

2:29:01.807 --> 2:29:03.392
-[indistinct shouting]
-[gasps]

2:29:09.106 --> 2:29:11.150
Grab the gun! Dean, grab the gun!

2:29:13.945 --> 2:29:15.196
[gasping]

2:29:17.531 --> 2:29:18.658
[Dean] Oh, no.

2:29:19.659 --> 2:29:21.327
No, no, no.

2:29:22.078 --> 2:29:23.746
-Oh, no.
-[gasping]

2:30:14.005 --> 2:30:16.215
I punished them bad men.

2:30:17.008 --> 2:30:18.676
I punished them both.

2:30:19.051 --> 2:30:20.261
Why?

2:30:21.220 --> 2:30:22.346
Why Wild Bill?

2:30:23.764 --> 2:30:27.309
I saw in his heart when he grabbed my arm.

2:30:28.936 --> 2:30:30.730
I saw what Wild Billy done.

2:30:31.605 --> 2:30:33.399
Saw it plain as day.

2:30:34.942 --> 2:30:37.486
You can't hide what's in your heart.

2:30:38.029 --> 2:30:39.196
What?

2:30:40.906 --> 2:30:42.241
You saw what?

2:30:46.245 --> 2:30:47.997
Take my hand, boss.

2:30:51.459 --> 2:30:52.918
You see for yourself.

2:30:55.046 --> 2:30:57.590
Paul, no.

2:31:02.094 --> 2:31:03.304
Please.

2:31:09.560 --> 2:31:10.770
[grunts]

2:31:11.812 --> 2:31:13.814
No, no, no.

2:31:14.774 --> 2:31:17.526
-Please.
-I gots to, boss.

2:31:17.610 --> 2:31:20.112
I gots to give you a little bit of myself.

2:31:21.864 --> 2:31:23.866
-A gift.
-[girls laughing]

2:31:24.617 --> 2:31:28.621
A gift of what's inside of me
so you can see for yourself.

2:32:22.758 --> 2:32:24.009
[Marjorie] Klaus!

2:32:26.554 --> 2:32:29.682
Suppertime! Bring the girls.

2:32:33.853 --> 2:32:36.272
Girls! You heard your mama!

2:32:37.565 --> 2:32:40.151
[squealing] Yes, papa! We're coming!

2:32:40.234 --> 2:32:42.194

2:32:55.875 --> 2:32:57.793
[sobbing]

2:32:58.711 --> 2:33:01.839
Come on, Billy.
I worked you enough for one day.

2:33:02.631 --> 2:33:04.633
Come get you some supper.

2:33:07.303 --> 2:33:11.682
[girls] God is great, God is good,
and we thank you...

[Wharton whispering]<i> You love your sister?</i>

2:33:37.917 --> 2:33:40.127
<i>You make any noise, you know what happens?</i>

2:33:40.753 --> 2:33:43.172
I'm gonna kill her instead of you.

2:33:43.255 --> 2:33:46.717
You make any noise, I'm gonna kill her.
You understand?

2:33:46.800 --> 2:33:48.344
You understand?

2:33:48.928 --> 2:33:50.429
Shh!

2:34:04.401 --> 2:34:05.653
[sobbing]

2:34:06.987 --> 2:34:10.866
He killed them with they love,
they love for each other.

2:34:12.409 --> 2:34:14.286
Now you see how it is.

2:34:15.913 --> 2:34:18.207
That's the way it is every day.

2:34:19.124 --> 2:34:22.836
That's the way it is all over the world.

2:34:27.424 --> 2:34:29.134

Son?

2:34:42.815 --> 2:34:44.441
Son, can you hear me?

2:34:44.525 --> 2:34:45.818
Speak up if you can hear us.

2:34:46.819 --> 2:34:49.613
I think this boy's cheese
slid off his cracker.

2:34:49.947 --> 2:34:51.615
[men speaking indistinctly]

2:34:51.699 --> 2:34:54.910
[man 2] Percy,
I got to ask you a few questions.

2:34:54.994 --> 2:34:58.205
[Dean] That's right. One minute,
he was fine, and the next, blammo.

2:34:58.289 --> 2:35:00.708
[Brutal] Dirty bastard grabbed him
through the bars few days back.

2:35:00.791 --> 2:35:02.793
Scared the boy so bad, he wet hisself.

2:35:04.461 --> 2:35:07.214
See, we didn't even...
We didn't see it happen.

2:35:07.298 --> 2:35:09.008
[continue speaking indistinctly]

2:35:11.385 --> 2:35:16.515
I'll cover for you as much as I can,
even if it means my job.

2:35:17.766 --> 2:35:19.518
But I have to know,

2:35:20.144 --> 2:35:22.938
does this have anything to do
with what happened at my house?

2:35:26.191 --> 2:35:27.693
Does it, Paul?

2:35:29.695 --> 2:35:30.738
No.

2:36:06.106 --> 2:36:08.317
[soft music playing on radio]

2:36:35.511 --> 2:36:37.012
[clicks tongue]

2:36:37.096 --> 2:36:38.305
[sighs]

2:36:55.155 --> 2:36:56.448
[turns radio off]

2:36:58.367 --> 2:37:01.703
Does Hal know?
That Coffey's innocent, I mean.

2:37:03.455 --> 2:37:05.124
Well, can he help?

2:37:05.666 --> 2:37:08.293
Does he have the influence
to do something about this?

2:37:08.836 --> 2:37:10.254
Stop the execution?

2:37:10.337 --> 2:37:11.380
No.

2:37:14.675 --> 2:37:16.635
Then don't tell him.

2:37:16.718 --> 2:37:18.804
If it can't help, don't tell him.

2:37:19.471 --> 2:37:20.556
Ever.

2:37:22.933 --> 2:37:24.476
I won't.

2:37:34.486 --> 2:37:36.029
[sighs]

2:37:36.113 --> 2:37:38.490
There's no way out of this
for you, is there?

2:37:40.284 --> 2:37:41.326
No.

2:37:42.411 --> 2:37:44.997
And I've been thinking about it,
believe me.

2:37:45.080 --> 2:37:48.292
I've been running it through my head
any number of ways.

2:37:48.834 --> 2:37:49.835
No.

2:37:51.128 --> 2:37:52.838
I'll tell you the truth, honey.

2:37:54.715 --> 2:37:58.886
I've done some things in my life
that I am not proud of,

2:38:00.095 --> 2:38:04.266
but this is the first time I've ever felt
real danger of hell.

2:38:06.185 --> 2:38:07.269
Hell?

2:38:09.021 --> 2:38:10.439
[whispers] Oh, Paul.

2:38:13.192 --> 2:38:14.568
Talk to him.

2:38:16.028 --> 2:38:17.488
Talk to John.

2:38:19.656 --> 2:38:21.533
Find out what he wants.

2:38:25.537 --> 2:38:27.456
[footsteps approaching]

2:38:27.539 --> 2:38:29.041
[keys jangling]

2:38:30.250 --> 2:38:32.002
[cell door opening]

2:38:38.550 --> 2:38:39.635
Hello, boss.

2:38:40.594 --> 2:38:42.012
Hello, John.

2:38:43.388 --> 2:38:45.682
I guess you know
we're coming down to it now.

2:38:46.642 --> 2:38:48.227
Another couple of days.

2:39:01.782 --> 2:39:04.326
Is there anything special
you wanna eat for dinner that night?

2:39:05.285 --> 2:39:07.162
We can rustle you up most anything.

2:39:17.631 --> 2:39:19.633
Meat loaf be nice.

2:39:19.716 --> 2:39:23.595
Mashed taters, gravy. Okra.

2:39:25.264 --> 2:39:28.016
Maybe some of that fine corn bread
your missus make.

2:39:28.850 --> 2:39:30.769
If she don't mind.

2:39:33.146 --> 2:39:34.481
Now, uh...

2:39:35.190 --> 2:39:39.528
What about a preacher?
Someone to say a little prayer with.

2:39:40.237 --> 2:39:42.114
Don't want no preacher.

2:39:43.532 --> 2:39:45.951
You can say a prayer, if you like.

2:39:46.785 --> 2:39:48.120
Me?

2:39:50.872 --> 2:39:53.417
Suppose I could, if it came to that.

2:39:57.671 --> 2:39:58.797
John,

2:40:01.758 --> 2:40:04.469
I have to ask you
something very important now.

2:40:06.346 --> 2:40:08.390
I know what you gonna say.

2:40:09.016 --> 2:40:10.392
You don't have to say it.

2:40:10.851 --> 2:40:13.604
No, I do. I do. I have to say it.

2:40:15.105 --> 2:40:16.523
John,

2:40:18.233 --> 2:40:20.360
tell me what you want me to do.

2:40:21.445 --> 2:40:23.280
You want me to take you out of here?

2:40:24.615 --> 2:40:26.658
Just let you run away?

2:40:26.742 --> 2:40:28.452
See how far you could get?

2:40:30.203 --> 2:40:32.497
Why would you do such a foolish thing?

2:40:34.916 --> 2:40:37.461
On the day of my judgment,

2:40:37.544 --> 2:40:40.047
when I stand before God

2:40:40.130 --> 2:40:43.425
and he asks me why did I...

2:40:44.301 --> 2:40:48.680
Did I kill one of his true miracles,

2:40:50.307 --> 2:40:52.184
what am I going to say?

2:40:53.393 --> 2:40:55.145
That it was my job?

2:40:57.606 --> 2:40:59.024
It's my job.

2:40:59.691 --> 2:41:03.695
You tell God the Father
it was a kindness you done.

2:41:07.532 --> 2:41:09.701
I know you're hurting and worrying.

2:41:10.702 --> 2:41:14.122
I can feel it on you.
But you ought to quit on it now.

2:41:15.457 --> 2:41:17.959
I want it to be over and done with.

2:41:19.211 --> 2:41:20.337
I do.

2:41:22.047 --> 2:41:23.215
[sighs]

2:41:25.258 --> 2:41:26.885
I'm tired, boss.

2:41:28.387 --> 2:41:32.391
I'm tired of being on the road,
lonely as a sparrow in the rain.

2:41:34.142 --> 2:41:36.895
I'm tired of never having me
a buddy to be with,

2:41:37.521 --> 2:41:41.441
to tell me where we's going to,
coming from, or why.

2:41:42.984 --> 2:41:46.697
Mostly, I'm tired of people
being ugly to each other.

2:41:48.115 --> 2:41:51.910
I'm tired of all the pain
I feel and hear in the world,

2:41:52.577 --> 2:41:53.912
every day.

2:41:54.413 --> 2:41:56.331
There's too much of it.

2:41:56.873 --> 2:41:59.960
It's like pieces of glass in my head,

2:42:00.794 --> 2:42:02.254
all the time.

2:42:04.798 --> 2:42:06.550
Can you understand?

2:42:09.553 --> 2:42:12.180
Yes, John, I think I can.

2:42:15.016 --> 2:42:17.227
[Brutal] Well, there must be something
we can do for you, John.

2:42:20.605 --> 2:42:22.441
There must be something that you want.

2:42:32.200 --> 2:42:35.746
I ain't never seen me a flicker show.

2:42:37.789 --> 2:42:39.458
[man singing on screen]

2:42:39.541 --> 2:42:41.501
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

2:42:42.627 --> 2:42:48.175
<i>And my heart beats</i>
<i>so that I can hardly speak</i>

2:42:49.342 --> 2:42:54.931
<i>And I seem to find the happiness I seek</i>

2:42:55.724 --> 2:43:01.062
<i>When we're out together dancing</i>
<i>cheek to cheek</i>

2:44:02.374 --> 2:44:04.459
Why, they's angels.

2:44:05.752 --> 2:44:08.380
Angels, just like up in heaven.

2:44:08.463 --> 2:44:10.090
[music continues]

2:44:27.065 --> 2:44:28.942
[keys jangling]

2:45:09.107 --> 2:45:11.067
It be all right, fellas.

2:45:12.527 --> 2:45:14.571
This here's the hard part.

2:45:16.072 --> 2:45:17.532
I'll be all right in a little while.

2:45:18.533 --> 2:45:22.787
John, I should have this just for now.

2:45:27.292 --> 2:45:29.294
I'll give it back after.

2:45:32.631 --> 2:45:36.885
You know, I fell asleep this afternoon
and had me a dream.

2:45:38.720 --> 2:45:40.513
I dreamed about Del's mouse.

2:45:41.973 --> 2:45:43.016
Did you, John?

2:45:43.683 --> 2:45:48.396
I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down
to that place Boss Howell talked about.

2:45:48.480 --> 2:45:50.315
That Mouseville place.

2:45:51.107 --> 2:45:53.276
I dreamed there's kids.
[laughs]

2:45:54.027 --> 2:45:57.781
And how they laughed at his tricks. My!
[continues laughing]

2:45:59.699 --> 2:46:03.161
I dreamed that those two little
blond-headed girls was there.

2:46:03.870 --> 2:46:05.914
They's laughing, too.

2:46:05.997 --> 2:46:09.250
I put my arms around them
and set 'em on my knees.

2:46:09.334 --> 2:46:13.421
And there's no blood coming out
of they hair, and they's just fine.

2:46:13.505 --> 2:46:16.675
We all watched Mr. Jingles
roll that spool.

2:46:18.176 --> 2:46:19.427
How we did laugh.

2:46:19.511 --> 2:46:21.304
Fit to bust, we was!

2:46:37.445 --> 2:46:38.530
John.

2:46:39.739 --> 2:46:43.952
[whispering] They's lots of folks here
that hate me. Lots!

2:46:45.745 --> 2:46:47.247
I can feel it.

2:46:47.998 --> 2:46:49.874
It's like bees stinging me.

2:46:50.291 --> 2:46:52.502
Well, feel how we feel, then.

2:46:54.004 --> 2:46:55.046
We don't hate you.

2:46:56.631 --> 2:46:58.049
Can you feel that?

2:47:00.385 --> 2:47:02.345
[Klaus] Kill him twice, you boys!

2:47:03.263 --> 2:47:07.434
You go on and kill
that raping baby killer twice!

2:47:07.517 --> 2:47:09.060
That'd be fine!

2:47:25.869 --> 2:47:28.329
Wipe your face before you stand up, Dean.

2:47:28.747 --> 2:47:29.998
Yes, sir.

2:47:30.749 --> 2:47:32.083
[sniffles]

2:47:32.751 --> 2:47:33.918
[sighs]

2:47:42.093 --> 2:47:43.261
Roll on one.

2:47:47.348 --> 2:47:49.017
[machine whirring]

2:47:51.269 --> 2:47:54.689
[Marjorie] Does it hurt yet?
I hope it does.

2:47:55.648 --> 2:47:57.692
I hope it hurts like hell.

2:47:59.944 --> 2:48:01.863
John Coffey, you've been condemned to die

2:48:01.946 --> 2:48:03.948
in the electric chair
by a jury of your peers,

2:48:04.032 --> 2:48:07.827
sentence imposed by a judge
in good standing in this state.

2:48:07.911 --> 2:48:10.663
Do you have anything to say
before sentence is carried out?

2:48:12.957 --> 2:48:14.918
I'm sorry for what I am.

2:48:27.514 --> 2:48:28.973
Please, boss,

2:48:30.558 --> 2:48:32.977
don't put that thing over my face.

2:48:34.479 --> 2:48:36.481
Don't put me in the dark.

2:48:37.482 --> 2:48:39.692
[whispering] I's afraid of the dark.

2:48:49.828 --> 2:48:51.162
[softly] All right, John.

2:49:11.558 --> 2:49:14.602
[singing softly]

John Coffey,

2:49:48.219 --> 2:49:51.514
electricity shall now be passed
through your body until you are dead

2:49:51.598 --> 2:49:53.474
in accordance with state law.

2:49:56.144 --> 2:49:59.397
May God have mercy on your soul.

2:50:34.349 --> 2:50:35.391
[whispering] Paul.

2:50:38.603 --> 2:50:40.313
You have to say it.

2:50:42.190 --> 2:50:44.275
You have to give the order.

2:51:02.585 --> 2:51:04.879
[John] <i>He killed 'em with they love.</i>

2:51:04.963 --> 2:51:09.008
<i>That's how it is every day</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

2:51:23.564 --> 2:51:25.108
[shakily] Roll on two.

2:51:26.651 --> 2:51:28.194
[electricity sizzling]

2:53:09.754 --> 2:53:12.423
[Paul] <i>It was the last execution</i>
<i>I ever took part in.</i>

2:53:13.257 --> 2:53:15.885
I just couldn't do it anymore after that.

2:53:15.968 --> 2:53:21.933
Brutal either. We both transferred out,
took jobs with Boys' Correctional.

2:53:23.101 --> 2:53:24.769
It was all right.

2:53:25.603 --> 2:53:28.106
"Catch them young" became my motto.

2:53:31.651 --> 2:53:32.944
You don't believe me.

2:53:33.778 --> 2:53:36.406
I don't imagine you'd lie to me, Paul.

2:53:37.031 --> 2:53:39.409
-It's just that--
-It's quite a story.

2:53:39.492 --> 2:53:41.244
It's quite a story.

2:53:42.120 --> 2:53:44.539
One thing I don't understand.

2:53:44.622 --> 2:53:49.836
You said you and Jan
had a grown son in 1935.

2:53:50.461 --> 2:53:51.963
Is that right?

2:53:52.422 --> 2:53:54.382
The math doesn't work, does it?

2:54:00.012 --> 2:54:02.348
Do you feel up to taking a walk?

2:54:03.057 --> 2:54:04.642
[birds chirping]

2:54:23.286 --> 2:54:24.495
[Paul] Watch your step.

2:54:25.288 --> 2:54:27.290
Now let your eyes adjust.

2:54:39.427 --> 2:54:40.595
There.

2:54:43.097 --> 2:54:46.934
Hey. Wake up, old fella. Wake up.

2:54:50.938 --> 2:54:54.692
Paul, it isn't. It can't be.

2:54:59.197 --> 2:55:00.615
Come over here, boy.

2:55:01.199 --> 2:55:03.409
Come on over here and see this lady.

2:55:06.412 --> 2:55:09.081
That can't be Mr. Jingles.

2:55:15.213 --> 2:55:17.006
[speaking in French]

2:55:32.063 --> 2:55:33.981
Go on, you can do it.

2:55:41.656 --> 2:55:45.535
This isn't exactly the Mouseville
we had in mind, is it?

2:55:46.953 --> 2:55:50.248
But we make do. Don't we, old fella?

2:55:57.380 --> 2:56:00.258
I think Mr. Jingles happened by accident.

2:56:01.551 --> 2:56:05.930
I think when we electrocuted Del,
and it all went so badly,

2:56:06.472 --> 2:56:08.766
well, John could feel that, you know.

2:56:09.267 --> 2:56:11.811
And I think a part of

2:56:12.937 --> 2:56:15.565
whatever magic was inside of him

2:56:15.648 --> 2:56:18.359
just leapt into my tiny friend here.

2:56:20.236 --> 2:56:21.821
As for me,

2:56:23.281 --> 2:56:25.783
John had to give me a part of himself,

2:56:26.284 --> 2:56:28.578
a gift, the way he saw it,

2:56:28.661 --> 2:56:31.622
so that I could see for myself
what Wild Bill had done.

2:56:34.542 --> 2:56:36.294
When John did that,

2:56:38.296 --> 2:56:40.131
when he took my hand,

2:56:41.632 --> 2:56:43.342
a part of the power

2:56:43.968 --> 2:56:45.553
that worked through him

2:56:46.345 --> 2:56:47.972
spilled into me.

2:56:48.806 --> 2:56:50.016
He what?

2:56:50.891 --> 2:56:54.478
He infected you with life?

2:56:56.022 --> 2:56:58.149
It's as good a word as any.

2:56:59.817 --> 2:57:03.904
He infected us both, didn't he,
Mr. Jingles? With life.

2:57:08.618 --> 2:57:10.995
I'm 108 years old, Elaine.

2:57:11.829 --> 2:57:15.416
I was 44 the year that John Coffey
walked the Green Mile.

2:57:19.086 --> 2:57:21.005
You mustn't blame John.

2:57:21.505 --> 2:57:26.135
He couldn't help what happened.
He was... He's just a force of nature.

2:57:27.970 --> 2:57:31.766
Oh, I've lived to see
some amazing things, Ellie.

2:57:33.351 --> 2:57:35.561
Another century come to pass.

2:57:36.562 --> 2:57:37.938
But I've...

2:57:39.148 --> 2:57:43.319
I've had to see my friends
and loved ones die off through the years.

2:57:44.028 --> 2:57:45.655
Hal and Melinda,

2:57:46.489 --> 2:57:47.948
Brutus Howell,

2:57:48.032 --> 2:57:50.284
my wife, my boy.

2:57:53.704 --> 2:57:55.331
And you, Elaine.

2:57:56.666 --> 2:57:58.250
You'll die, too.

2:57:59.835 --> 2:58:03.547
And my curse is knowing
that I'll be there to see it.

2:58:05.716 --> 2:58:07.843
It's my atonement, you see.

2:58:08.719 --> 2:58:10.388
It's my punishment

2:58:10.721 --> 2:58:13.265
for letting John Coffey
ride the lightning,

2:58:15.059 --> 2:58:17.269
<i>for killing a miracle of God.</i>

2:58:19.230 --> 2:58:21.649
[priest] <i>Almighty, everlasting God,</i>

2:58:22.525 --> 2:58:24.485
the source of all being and life...

2:58:25.236 --> 2:58:28.948
[Paul] <i>You'll be gone like all the others.</i>
<i>I'll have to stay.</i>

2:58:31.492 --> 2:58:34.954
<i>Oh, I'll die eventually. Of that I'm sure.</i>

2:58:36.205 --> 2:58:39.333
<i>I have no illusions of immortality.</i>

2:58:40.459 --> 2:58:42.795
<i>But I will have wished for death</i>

2:58:43.462 --> 2:58:45.589
<i>long before death finds me.</i>

2:58:47.216 --> 2:58:50.177
<i>In truth, I wish for it already.</i>

2:58:50.261 --> 2:58:52.471
[soft music playing on radio]

2:58:56.851 --> 2:58:58.436
[soft squeaking]

2:59:03.107 --> 2:59:04.483
Mr. Jingles?

2:59:14.118 --> 2:59:15.870
Where you been, hmm?

2:59:16.579 --> 2:59:20.708
Been worried about you, boy.
You hungry, hmm?

2:59:20.791 --> 2:59:23.043
Let's go see
if we can't find you something to eat.

2:59:24.378 --> 2:59:26.130
A few crumbs anyway.

2:59:26.213 --> 2:59:28.132
I know you'd like that.

2:59:29.425 --> 2:59:31.427
Look at you. Mr. Jingles.

2:59:32.470 --> 2:59:35.723
<i>I lie in bed most nights</i>
<i>thinking about it.</i>

2:59:36.557 --> 2:59:37.933
<i>And I wait.</i>

2:59:39.185 --> 2:59:42.271
<i>I think about all the people I've loved,</i>

2:59:42.354 --> 2:59:43.856
<i>now long gone.</i>

2:59:45.316 --> 2:59:47.860
<i>I think about my beautiful Jan,</i>

2:59:47.943 --> 2:59:50.321
<i>how I lost her so many years ago.</i>

2:59:52.156 --> 2:59:57.244
<i>And I think about all of us</i>
<i>walking our own Green Mile,</i>

2:59:57.328 --> 2:59:59.163
<i>each in our own time.</i>

3:00:00.956 --> 3:00:04.084
<i>But one thought more than any other</i>

3:00:04.168 --> 3:00:06.253
<i>keeps me awake most nights.</i>

3:00:08.005 --> 3:00:11.300
<i>If he could make a mouse live so long,</i>

3:00:12.510 --> 3:00:14.553
<i>how much longer do I have?</i>

3:00:19.016 --> 3:00:21.393
<i>We each owe a death.</i>

3:00:22.061 --> 3:00:24.021
<i>There are no exceptions.</i>

3:00:25.189 --> 3:00:26.690
<i>But, oh, God,</i>

3:00:28.234 --> 3:00:29.902
<i>sometimes,</i>

3:00:30.528 --> 3:00:33.364
<i>the Green Mile seems so long.</i>
