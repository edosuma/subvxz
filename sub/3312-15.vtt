WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:08.509
PREVIOUSLY ON
"MELISSA & JOEY"...

00:08.542 --> 00:10.544
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED.

00:10.578 --> 00:12.580
THERE IS ENORMOUS
SCANDAL AT PRODKO.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.448
IF SHE MARRIED A U.S. CITIZEN,

00:14.482 --> 00:16.584
I COULD SAVE HER FROM
BEING EXTRADITED.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.486
WILL YOU MARRY ME AND BECOME A U.S.
CITIZEN?

00:18.519 --> 00:23.291
- DA!
- THIS IS THE HAPPIEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.525
HOLY CANNOLI.

00:27.095 --> 00:29.463
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:29.497 --> 00:32.333
I MUST CALL MY PARENTS AND
TELL THEM OF YOUR PROPOSAL

00:32.366 --> 00:34.168
AND THAT WE ARE TO BE
GREEN-CARD MARRIED.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.337
I'M SURE THEY'VE BEEN WAITING
YEARS TO GET THAT PHONE CALL.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.406
OH, THEY'RE GONNA BE SO PROUD.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.541
TELL THEM THAT THEIR FAKE
SON-IN-LAW SAYS "HEY."

00:40.574 --> 00:42.476
- ( chuckles )
- HEY, JOE, LISTEN,

00:42.510 --> 00:44.345
I HATE TO GET ALL
RATIONAL ON YOU...

00:44.378 --> 00:46.380
MUST BE WHY YOU NEVER DO IT.
( clears throat )

00:46.414 --> 00:51.285
SO, UM... THIS MARRYING A TOTAL
STRANGER FROM A DIFFERENT HEMISPHERE,

00:51.319 --> 00:54.588
WAS THAT A STUPID IDEA OR
AN INCREDIBLY STUPID IDEA?

00:56.557 --> 00:58.592
IT WAS TOTALLY SPONTANEOUS.
I MEAN, I SAW A WOMAN

00:58.626 --> 01:01.595
IN DISTRESS AND... BAM...
JUST LEAPT INTO ACTION.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.231
OH, LIKE A SUPERHERO?

01:03.264 --> 01:06.167
THOSE ARE YOUR WORDS,
BUT THEY'RE ACCURATE.

01:07.435 --> 01:10.171
SO YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS

01:10.204 --> 01:12.240
WAS BASICALLY... BAM.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.642
MEL, WHEN A FIREMAN RESCUES A
LADY FROM A BURNING BUILDING,

01:14.675 --> 01:17.245
- THEY DON'T STOP TO ASK QUESTIONS.
- YEAH, BUT FIREMEN AREN'T

01:17.278 --> 01:20.148
USUALLY BOINKING PEOPLE ON
THE WAY DOWN THE LADDER.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.515
WHY IS THIS BOTHERING
YOU SO MUCH?

01:21.549 --> 01:23.251
OH, I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE
BECAUSE ONE OF US

01:23.284 --> 01:24.752
DOESN'T HAVE A CAREER
THAT'S YET RUINED.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.888
YOU WORK FOR ME. I DON'T WANT TO BE
INVOLVED IN SOME POTENTIAL SCANDAL.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.358
THERE'S NO SCANDAL, ALL RIGHT?
I'M JUST HELPING SOMEBODY OUT.

01:30.391 --> 01:33.461
SOMEONE WHO'S KIND,
AND SWEET, AND HOT,

01:33.494 --> 01:35.463
AND HONEST, VULNERABLE

01:35.496 --> 01:37.665
AND EXTREMELY HOT.

01:37.698 --> 01:40.601
HEY, WHICH BRAIN IS MAKING
THE DECISION HERE, JOE?

01:40.634 --> 01:42.436
THE UPPER BRAIN OR
THE LOWER BRAIN?

01:42.470 --> 01:44.638
BEFORE YOU JUDGE, WOULD YOU
JUST THINK ABOUT IT, PLEASE?

01:44.672 --> 01:46.674
OKAY, FINE. FOR YOU,
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.609
BAM!

01:48.642 --> 01:50.311
STILL HATE IT.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.647
- ♪ IT'S ALL GOOD
- ♪ ALL GOOD

01:53.681 --> 01:55.549
- ♪ IT'S OKAY
- ♪ OKAY

01:55.583 --> 01:57.318
- ♪ IT'S ALL RIGHT
- ♪ ALL RIGHT

01:57.351 --> 01:59.220
♪ AS FAR AS I CAN SEE

01:59.253 --> 02:00.688

02:00.721 --> 02:02.690

02:02.723 --> 02:04.425

- ♪ ALL RIGHT

02:04.458 --> 02:07.361
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

02:07.395 --> 02:10.164
♪ WITH ME ♪

02:15.236 --> 02:18.172
HOW DOES THIS WORK? WE HEAT THIS
THING UP AND IT TURNS INTO FOOD?

02:18.206 --> 02:21.709
YOU WANT ME TO HEAT UP MY
CELLPHONE AND CALL FOR PIZZA?

02:21.742 --> 02:23.511
AH. THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE HOME.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.379
WHAT IS THIS, CHICKEN OR BEEF?

02:25.413 --> 02:27.748
THAT'S THE ICE PACK I'VE BEEN
USING FOR MY GROIN INJURY.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.718
EWW.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.553
WHAT? HERE.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.389
TURKEY CASSEROLE, ALL RIGHT?

02:35.423 --> 02:36.624
PROTEIN, VEGETABLES...
EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

02:36.657 --> 02:40.194
PLUS IT GOES GREAT
WITH ICE PACK.

02:40.228 --> 02:43.331
SO HOW'D IT GO AT CITY HALL? DID
YOU GET THE MARRIAGE LICENSE?

02:43.364 --> 02:46.500
NO, I GOTTA GO BACK IN THE MORNING, BRING
'EM MY FRIGGING BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

02:46.534 --> 02:49.303
YOU DO NOT REALIZE HOW MANY PIECES OF
PAPERWORK YOU HAVE TO THROW AT THESE PEOPLE

02:49.337 --> 02:51.739
WHEN YOUR BRIDE-TO-BE'S ONLY
BEEN IN THE COUNTRY FOR 10 DAYS.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.641
IT'S LIKE THEY THINK I'M TRYING TO
PULL A FAST ONE ON THEM OR SOMETHING.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.709
YOU ARE.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.711
YEAH, MAYBE, BUT I'M DOING
THE RIGHT THING, ALL RIGHT?

02:57.745 --> 02:59.513
AND I'M HAVING A LOT
OF FUN DOING IT.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.752
AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT THINKS
THIS SHAM WEDDING IS NUTS?

03:04.785 --> 03:06.620
DO YOU REALLY WANT MY OPINION

03:06.654 --> 03:08.489
OR DO YOU WANT ME
TO JUST NOD ALONG?

03:08.522 --> 03:10.458
JUST NOD ALONG.

03:10.491 --> 03:14.228
OKAY, FOR STARTERS, YOU
KNOW, IT'S ILLEGAL.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.264
AND HOW IS THIS EVEN GONNA WORK?

03:16.297 --> 03:18.766
WHAT, IS ELENA GONNA GET AN APARTMENT?
HOW LONG DO THEY HAVE TO STAY MARRIED?

03:18.799 --> 03:20.234
ARE THEY GONNA
HAVE PRETEND KIDS?

03:20.268 --> 03:23.571
WELL, IF THEY DO, THEY BETTER GET ON A
WAITING LIST FOR PRETEND PRESCHOOL.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.773
COME ON, GIVE JOE A BREAK.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.675
WHAT HE'S DOING IS REALLY GREAT.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.010
WHAT?! THIS IS WHY I
TOLD YOU TO NOD ALONG.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.679
WHAT IS SO GREAT ABOUT IT?
NAME ONE SINGLE THING.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.647
HE'S SAVING AN INNOCENT PERSON

03:33.681 --> 03:36.384
FROM ARREST,
DEPORTATION AND JAIL.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.519
HE'S RISKING HIMSELF TO
HELP ANOTHER PERSON.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.554
HE'S LIKE... GANDHI.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.024
THE ONLY THING JOE AND
GANDHI HAVE IN COMMON

03:44.057 --> 03:45.759
IS THEY BOTH LIKE TO
GO AROUND SHIRTLESS.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.662
WHEN THE LAW IS WRONG,

03:48.696 --> 03:50.464
YOU CAN EITHER STAND
ASIDE AND DO NOTHING

03:50.498 --> 03:52.466
OR YOU CAN JUMP ONBOARD
AND FIGHT INJUSTICE.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.502
OKAY, WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST GO TO THE MALL

03:54.535 --> 03:56.537
AND BUY SOME SLUTTY TOPS
LIKE A REGULAR TEENAGER?

03:56.570 --> 03:58.706
TOTES! CAN I HAVE, LIKE, $80?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.008
ASHLEY AND I ARE SO GETTING
OUR EARS PIERCED SOME MORE.

04:01.041 --> 04:04.345
- HAPPY?
- NOT SO MUCH.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.718
OH HEY, AUNT MEL, FOUND
THIS GREAT WEBSITE...

04:10.751 --> 04:13.587
"MAKE YOUR GREEN CARD
MARRIAGE LOOK REAL."

04:13.621 --> 04:14.788
I DON'T WANNA HEAR THIS.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.425
I AM NOT INVOLVED IN THIS
ILLEGAL ACTIVITY IN ANY WAY.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.728
GOT IT. HEY, WHICH INVITATION
DO YOU LIKE BETTER,

04:20.761 --> 04:22.730
THE ONE WITH THE WEDDING BELLS
OR THE ONE WITH THE BIRDS?

04:22.763 --> 04:26.300
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME? I REFUSE TO BE
DRAWN INTO THIS INTERNATIONAL FELONY.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.469
BIRDS... ALWAYS GO
WITH THE BIRDS.

04:30.471 --> 04:33.807
HOW IS PULLING SWEATER OVER EYES OF
UNCLE SAM GOING, MY FAVORITE BOY?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.611
I'M, UH... ( laughing )

04:41.749 --> 04:43.851
I FORGOT WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.455
- INVITATIONS.
- OH RIGHT.

04:47.488 --> 04:50.090
YEAH, WELL, I PRINTED UP A FEW
THAT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.826
THESE ARE BEAUTIFUL.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.762
YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH FOR ME.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.565
YEAH, WELL, WE STILL NEED
TO GET WEDDING PHOTOS.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.800
THERE'S A LOT TO DO IF WE
REALLY WANNA PULL THIS OFF.

04:59.833 --> 05:03.604
- HOW CAN I EVER THANK YOU?
- DON'T GO DOWN THAT ROAD.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.740
( knocks on door ) AGENT
MILES PURVIS, IMMIGRATION.

05:06.774 --> 05:10.378
- ( gasps ) IT'S THE FEDS!
- UH, JUST A SEC! I'M ALL NAKED!

05:10.411 --> 05:13.814
- THIS IS JUST GREAT!
- WHERE IS JOE? I'M NOT READY.

05:13.847 --> 05:17.685
- I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY!
- HIDE UP IN MY BEDROOM! LET'S GO!

05:20.654 --> 05:22.590
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TELL THEM?
YOU CAN'T TELL THEM THE TRUTH.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.124
HE'S A FEDERAL AGENT.
I CAN'T LIE TO HIM.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.395
OKAY, LET ME TALK TO HIM. I'M 16.
I CAN LIE ALL DAY.

05:27.428 --> 05:30.931
- YOU JUST SMILE AND LOOK PRETTY.
- THAT I CAN DO.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.503
- HELLO.
- ARE YOU MEL BURKE?

05:35.536 --> 05:38.606
- YES, I AM.
- I'M MEL BURKE. PLEASE COME IN.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.841
I'M HERE ABOUT A
MARRIAGE LICENSE

05:40.874 --> 05:43.677
APPLIED FOR BY A JOSEPH P.
LONGO.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.514
SINCE THE WOMAN HE IS MARRYING IS
ON A TOURIST VISA FROM RUSSIA,

05:46.547 --> 05:49.517
- IT RAISED A FEW RED FLAGS.
- I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

05:49.550 --> 05:50.951
- WON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT?
- WE DON'T DO THAT.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.622
I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND

05:54.655 --> 05:57.791
HOW INCREDIBLY IN LOVE
JOE AND ELENA ARE.

05:57.825 --> 06:01.429
IT'S NOT JUST MISS ROMANOV'S VISA
STATUS THAT'S RAISING SUSPICIONS.

06:01.462 --> 06:04.798
IT'S ALSO MR. LONGO'S CHECKERED
PAST, HIS PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.601
I WOULDN'T PUT ANYTHING PAST MR.
LONGO.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.737
- WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S DONE.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

06:09.770 --> 06:12.573
HIS INVOLVEMENT IN A PONZI SCHEME.
HE HAS A HISTORY OF FRAUD.

06:12.606 --> 06:16.877
UH, OKAY. WELL, HE WAS
COMPLETELY INNOCENT OF THAT.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.179
HE WAS A VICTIM AND HE
LOST EVERYTHING TOO.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.715
YOU DON'T KNOW JOE LONGO AT ALL.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.417
IF YOU'RE SUCH AN
EXPERT ON THE MAN,

06:23.451 --> 06:24.752
TELL ME HOW YOU KNOW THEIR
RELATIONSHIP IS LEGITIMATE.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.755
- I DON'T HAVE TO PROVE ANYTHING TO YOU.
- ACTUALLY, YOU DO,

06:27.788 --> 06:29.490
BECAUSE IF HE'S TRYING TO
DEFRAUD THE GOVERNMENT,

06:29.523 --> 06:30.791
THERE WILL BE SERIOUS
CONSEQUENCES.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.960
OKAY, WELL, LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING, BUSTER.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.563
FIRST OF ALL, IF YOU WANNA TOUCH

06:35.596 --> 06:36.764
MY PICTURES AND MY CANDY
DISHES, GET A WARRANT.

06:36.797 --> 06:41.435
AND SECOND, JOE AND ELENA'S
LOVE IS AS LEGITIMATE AS...

06:41.469 --> 06:44.972
AS THESE WEDDING INVITATIONS.
HUH.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.708
"MR. AND MRS. YOUR NAME HERE
REQUEST THE HONOR OF YOUR"...

06:47.741 --> 06:50.644
THIS IS A FIRST DRAFT.
BUT LOOK AT THOSE BIRDS.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.613
I MEAN IF THAT'S NOT A SYMBOL OF
TRUE LOVE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.981
YEAH, IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?

06:54.014 --> 06:57.885
NO, THERE'S TONS OF
OTHER STUFF, LIKE...

06:57.918 --> 06:59.987
LIKE A KILLER WEDDING DRESS.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.222
ANYONE CAN BUY A DRESS.
THAT PROVES NOTHING.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.725
OKAY, LOOK, YOU KNOW I'M
A CITY COUNCILWOMAN.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.594
IF THIS WASN'T A
REAL RELATIONSHIP,

07:06.627 --> 07:08.462
- WOULD I BE OFFICIATING THE WEDDING?
- YOU'RE GONNA WHAT?

07:08.496 --> 07:12.733
EVERY TIME I HEAR IT,
IT'S LIKE THE FIRST TIME.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.002
REALLY? YOU'LL BE
PERFORMING THE CEREMONY?

07:15.035 --> 07:17.938
YEAH, STICK THAT IN YOUR
REPORT, SECRET AGENT MAN.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.040
I'M MARRYING JOE LONGO.

07:26.980 --> 07:30.851
ELENA. HEY, HE'S GONE.
IT'S SAFE.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.520
I OVERHEARD WHAT YOU SAID.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.954
YOU WILL PERFORM THE WEDDING?
THIS IS TRUTHS?

07:33.987 --> 07:36.724
YEAH, I HEARD ME SAY IT TOO.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.792
- OH.
- OH!

07:38.826 --> 07:40.894
YOU ARE THE BEST B.F.F.
FRIEND A WOMAN HAS EVER HAD.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.797
NOW WE HAVE TO FIND A
REAL WEDDING DRESS

07:43.831 --> 07:45.232
SO IT WILL NOT LOOK
LIKE YOU WERE LYING.

07:45.265 --> 07:48.035
THAT WASN'T A LIE.
THERE IS A DRESS.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.541
HERE YOU GO. MEET VERA.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.008
SOMEONE SHOULD GET
SOME USE OUT OF HER.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.778
- AH, SHE IS AMAZING.
- YEAH, SHE SHOULD BE.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.947
SHE COST AS MUCH AS A SMALL CAR.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.649
WHY DIDN'T I BUY A CAR?

08:01.682 --> 08:03.016
YOU KNOW, A CAR DOESN'T
SILENTLY MOCK YOU

08:03.050 --> 08:04.952
FROM THE BACK OF YOUR
CLOSET FOR THREE YEARS.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.621
WHY DOES YOUR WEDDING
DRESS HAVE NAME?

08:07.655 --> 08:09.523
WELL, I TALK TO IT A LOT

08:09.557 --> 08:12.660
AND IF IT DIDN'T HAVE A NAME,
I WOULD JUST FEEL CRAZY.

08:12.693 --> 08:16.063
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY AS LONG AS WEDDING
DRESS DOES NOT TALK BACK TO YOU.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.999
SO WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?

08:19.032 --> 08:22.035
WELL, I WAS ENGAGED ONCE

08:22.069 --> 08:25.739
AND RIGHT BEFORE THE WEDDING, THERE
WAS JUST ONE LITTLE PROBLEM...

08:25.773 --> 08:28.542
I REALIZED HE WASN'T THE
ONE, SO I CALLED IT OFF.

08:28.576 --> 08:31.044
THAT MUST'VE CREATED GREAT
UNHAPPINESS FOR YOU.

08:31.078 --> 08:34.582
MMM, YEAH, THOSE WERE 83
MIGHTY UNPLEASANT PHONE CALLS.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.116
OH, AND I LOST THE
CAKE DEPOSIT TOO.

08:37.685 --> 08:41.789
WOW, CAKE LAWS IN THIS
COUNTRY ARE VERY STRICT.

08:41.822 --> 08:45.993
HEY, CAN WE KEEP THE STORY ABOUT MY
ALMOST WEDDING JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME?

08:46.026 --> 08:48.328
YOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH
TRUTH IN THIS HOUSE FOR ONE DAY.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.631
- MM-HMM.
- HEY, MEL,

08:50.664 --> 08:52.700
LENNOX JUST TOLD ME SOME IMMIGRATION
GUY WAS HERE AT THE HOUSE.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.968
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
- YES, SHE SAVED US

08:55.002 --> 08:57.571
AND SHE ALSO SAID SHE WOULD
PERFORM OUR WEDDING.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.575
REALLY? YOU'RE GONNA MARRY ME?

09:01.609 --> 09:04.311
YEAH. I MEAN, NOT JUST YOU...
BOTH OF YOU.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.648
( chuckles ) IT JUST SOUNDED
WEIRD THE WAY YOU SAID IT.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.349
THAT'S GREAT, BURKE. WHAT
MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

09:09.382 --> 09:11.351
OH, WELL, I JUST COULDN'T
STAND BY AND LET...

09:11.384 --> 09:13.887
LET ELENA GO TO JAIL.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.956
SHE ALSO SAID KIND
THINGS ABOUT YOU

09:15.989 --> 09:17.524
AND DEFENDED YOU
TO THAT BAD MAN.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.127
OH, PLEASE, I DOUBT I'D BE DEFENDING JOE.
DOES THAT SOUND LIKE ME AT ALL?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.029
NO, IT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE YOU AT ALL, NO.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.798
WELL, THANK YOU, BURKE. ALL
RIGHT, I'M GONNA GO INVITE

09:24.832 --> 09:25.933
SOME OF MY GYM BUDDIES
TO THE WEDDING.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.135
I'M GONNA TRY TO PASS 'EM
OFF AS SOME OF MY COUSINS,

09:28.168 --> 09:31.805
ALTHOUGH IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT 'CAUSE
THOSE GUYS AREN'T AS CUT AS I AM.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.974
- OH, BUT WHO IS.
- WELL...

09:34.007 --> 09:35.909
YEAH, NO ONE I KNOW.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.045
YEAH, LIKE I'D BE
DEFENDING THAT.

09:41.849 --> 09:45.152
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING TO THIS
COMPLETELY REAL AND LEGITIMATE WEDDING.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.621
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO NOSH
ON OUR DISASTER SUPPLIES.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.957
WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT BEEF
JERKY, SOME WATER PACKETS,

09:49.990 --> 09:52.660
UM, BUT PLEASE LEAVE THE FLARES.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.795
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GET
STARTED IN JUST A MINUTE.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.097
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE NOT A MESS.

09:57.130 --> 10:00.100
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WHEN THIS DAY
CAME, IT WOULD BE YOU AND JOE.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.169
OR BETTER YET, ME AND JOE.

10:02.202 --> 10:06.807
AND 50 WHITE DOVES RELEASED INTO THE AIR
AS EVERYONE SAYS, "HE'S A LUCKY MAN."

10:06.840 --> 10:09.977
YEAH, OKAY. WELL, DON'T LET
THIS GET AROUND, STEPHANIE,

10:10.010 --> 10:11.912
BUT THIS IS A FAKE WEDDING.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.181
THIS IS JUST TO GET ELENA A GREEN CARD.
THAT'S ALL IT'S ABOUT.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.183
THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE
VIDEO TO HELP SELL IT.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.885
YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING ALL
THIS TO MAKE ME FEEL GOOD?

10:17.918 --> 10:19.787
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.054
SO I STILL HAVE A SHOT WITH JOE?

10:21.088 --> 10:23.824
LET'S JUST SAY YOUR
CHANCES HAVEN'T CHANGED.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.094
YES!

10:28.095 --> 10:30.063
- HEY, JOE.
- HEY.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.065
SO THIS IS IT, HUH?

10:32.099 --> 10:34.067
YOU READY TO TAKE THAT
BIG PRETEND STEP?

10:34.101 --> 10:36.837
- YEAH, IS MY TIE RIGHT?
- CLOSE.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.208
WOW, YOU REALLY CLEAN
UP NICE, LONGO.

10:41.241 --> 10:44.011
- THANKS FOR DOING THIS, BURKE.
- WHO SAYS I'M DOING IT FOR YOU?

10:44.044 --> 10:47.715
I'M DOING IT FOR TRUTH, JUSTICE
AND STICKING IT TO THE MAN.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.018
WELL, THANKS FOR
STICKING IT TO THE MAN.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.887
- SHALL WE?
- YEAH, LET'S GET YOU MARRIED.

10:53.921 --> 10:56.957
FOR BETTER OR WORSE,
BUT NOT FOR REAL.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.426
( Joe chuckles )

10:59.459 --> 11:01.661
( organ music playing )

11:23.483 --> 11:26.186
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW BEAUTIFUL...

11:26.219 --> 11:28.221
JOE LOOKS.

11:30.157 --> 11:33.126
- UH, WHAT ABOUT ELENA?
- TALL SHOW-OFF.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.929
"OOH, LOOK AT ME,
I'M THE BRIDE."

11:44.071 --> 11:45.705
THANK YOU, RYDER.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.276
THANK... THANK...

11:50.177 --> 11:51.945
UNCLENCH.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.247
- IT'S JUST SO HARD TO WATCH HER GO.
- I KNOW.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.821
WOW. YOU LOOK, UM...

12:02.189 --> 12:05.993
- DAMN.
- RIGHT BACK ON YOU, HANDSOME MAN.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.128
OKAY, HEY HEY, YOU TWO,
LET'S NOT OVERSELL

12:08.161 --> 12:09.863
THIS WHOLE "WE'RE REALLY
IN LOVE" THING, OKAY?

12:09.897 --> 12:11.298
LET'S REMEMBER WHY WE'RE HERE.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.034
"DEAR FRIENDS, WE ARE
GATHERED HERE TODAY

12:14.067 --> 12:16.036
TO UNITE THIS MAN
AND THIS WOMAN"...

12:16.069 --> 12:18.071
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

12:18.105 --> 12:22.175
IF THAT IS TRUE, IT IS ONLY BECAUSE
MY HEART IS SO FULL OF LOVE.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.811
I FEEL IT TOO.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.246
WOW, THEY ARE SO CONVINCING.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.215
OH, THIS IS ALL PART OF THE ACT.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.819
I'M LOSING CONFIDENCE IN
MY FUTURE AS MRS. LONGO.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.154
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS
IS REALLY HAPPENING.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.824
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BURKE?

12:36.857 --> 12:38.191
I'M STICKING TO THE PLAN.
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?

12:38.225 --> 12:40.293
- HEY, BURKE...
- OKAY, FINE!

12:40.327 --> 12:43.196
- I LOST MY PLACE.
- WILL YOU JUST GO TO THE GOOD PART, PLEASE?

12:43.230 --> 12:46.266
OKAY OKAY. "ELENA ROMANOV,

12:46.299 --> 12:48.001
DO YOU TAKE THIS
MAN, JOSEPH LONGO,

12:48.035 --> 12:49.269
TO BE YOUR LAWFULLY
WEDDED HUSBAND?"

12:49.302 --> 12:52.840
- I DO.
- I OBJECT.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.174
- WHAT?
- SIDEBAR.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.209
S... SIDE... HEY,

12:56.243 --> 12:58.045
YOU CAN'T OFFICIATE AND
OBJECT AT THE SAME TIME.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.880
OH YEAH? IT'S MY OFFICE. I
CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.983
BURKE.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.254
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
- THAT'S WHAT I WAS GONNA ASK YOU.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.923
YOU SAID THIS WAS A RESCUE
MISSION, NOT A LOVE CONNECTION.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.292
WELL, I THOUGHT IT WAS
TOO, BUT THE TRUTH IS

13:13.393 --> 13:15.328
I THINK I'M FALLING IN
LOVE WITH HER, BURKE.

13:15.362 --> 13:18.065
YOU'RE FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOUR FIANCEE?
WHO DOES THAT?!

13:19.132 --> 13:21.568
WELL, WHEN SHE WAS
WALKING TOWARD ME,

13:21.601 --> 13:24.004
- LOOKING THE WAY SHE DOES IN THAT DRESS...
- IT'S JUST A DRESS.

13:24.037 --> 13:27.240
I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT I SAW
MORE THAN THE DRESS, BURKE.

13:27.274 --> 13:30.878
I THINK... I THINK
MAYBE I SAW MY FUTURE.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.947
OKAY, IT'S A DRESS, NOT
A MAGIC EIGHT BALL.

13:33.981 --> 13:35.983
JOE, THIS ISN'T WHAT
I SIGNED ON FOR.

13:36.016 --> 13:39.019
TRUE LOVE DESTROYS THE WHOLE
FOUNDATION OF A SHAM WEDDING.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.255
WELL, I THINK NOW
IT'S A REAL WEDDING.

13:42.289 --> 13:45.258
WHICH IS BETTER FOR YOU ANYWAY, RIGHT?
BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S

13:45.292 --> 13:47.827
ON THE UP AND UP. THERE'S NO
SCANDAL AND NOBODY GETS HURT.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.230
WELL, YEAH YEAH, NOBODY.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.966
- IT'S A WIN-WIN NOW.
- YEAH.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.301
AND EVERYBODY'S HAPPY, RIGHT?

13:54.334 --> 13:56.403
YEAH, EVERYBODY EXCEPT...

13:57.437 --> 13:59.406
STEPHANIE.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.375
"DO YOU, JOSEPH LONGO,

14:02.409 --> 14:05.212
TAKE ELENA ROMANOV TO BE
YOUR LEGALLY WEDDED WIFE?"

14:05.245 --> 14:07.380
TAKE YOUR TIME. NO PRESSURE.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.349
- I DO.
- FINAL ANSWER?

14:10.383 --> 14:13.386
- I DO.
- OKEY-DOKEY.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.156
"BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME"...
BLAH BLAH BLAH...

14:16.189 --> 14:18.358
"I NOW PRONOUNCE
YOU MAN AND WIFE."

14:18.391 --> 14:20.393
NO NO NO, NO TIME
FOR ANY OF THAT.

14:20.427 --> 14:23.130
THIS IS A GOVERNMENT OFFICE. I HAVE
A 4:00 WITH THE HEAD OF SANITATION.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.298
UH, STEPHANIE WILL
VALIDATE YOUR PARKING.

14:25.332 --> 14:28.401
AND DON'T TRY TO SNEAK ACROSS THE
STREET TO TARGET, 'CAUSE WE TOW.

14:42.349 --> 14:46.253
BACK IN THE BAG, VERA.
OH, QUIT MOCKING ME.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.321
HEY, AUNT MEL. HOW YOU DOING?

14:48.355 --> 14:51.458
OH, I'M FINE. I'M GOOD. I'M SUPER
GOOD AND GETTING BETTER, YEAH.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.194
AND NOT TALKING TO DRESSES,
'CAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE ME CRAZY.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.965
YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY IF YOU'RE
UPSET ABOUT LOSING JOE...

14:57.998 --> 15:01.334
- AS A NANNY.
- ( scoffs ) I DON'T CARE ABOUT JOE.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.971
YOU KNOW, MY LIFE WILL GO ON WITHOUT HIM.
I DON'T NEED HIM.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.339
( cellphone ringing )

15:06.373 --> 15:09.109
OH, IT'S JOE! I MEAN, JUST JOE.

15:09.142 --> 15:12.345
HEY, JOE, HOW'S THE
HOTEL ROOM I PAID FOR

15:12.379 --> 15:14.347
JUST TO PROVE HOW OKAY
I AM WITH EVERYTHING?

15:14.381 --> 15:16.183
HEY, BURKE, I GOT A
CRAZY QUESTION FOR YA:

15:16.216 --> 15:17.951
UM, IS ELENA THERE AT THE HOUSE?

15:17.985 --> 15:20.020
- NO, WHAT HAPPENED?
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:20.053 --> 15:23.356
WE GOT HERE TO THE HOTEL.
EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.092
WE WERE LAUGHING, OPENED
UP A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE

15:25.125 --> 15:26.726
AND THEN SHE GOT
THIS PHONE CALL.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.095
SHE STEPPED OUT IN THE
HALLWAY TO TAKE IT

15:28.128 --> 15:30.330
AND THE NEXT THING I HEARD WAS A
BUNCH OF SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.265
WHAT WAS SHE SAYING?

15:33.400 --> 15:36.436
I DON'T KNOW, ON ACCOUNT
OF ITS RUSSIANNESS.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.339
ANYWAY, IT GOT QUIET.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.308
I WENT OUT THERE TO SEE WHAT WAS
GOING ON AND SHE WASN'T THERE.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.276
I'VE CALLED HER SEVERAL
TIMES ON HER CELLPHONE,

15:43.310 --> 15:45.278
BUT SHE DIDN'T PICK UP.

15:45.312 --> 15:49.216
- OH, JOE.
- I KNOW. THIS IS BAD, BURKE.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.517
OAKY, WELL, SHE'LL BE BACK.

15:50.550 --> 15:54.054
YEAH, SHE PROBABLY RAN OUT TO
GET SOME HONEYMOON SUPPLIES,

15:54.087 --> 15:57.257
LIKE BREATH MINTS AND
THANK-YOU NOTES.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.359
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU JUST SIT TIGHT.
I'LL GO LOOK FOR HER.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.396
- ELENA'S MISSING.
- THE FEDS GOT HER.

16:03.430 --> 16:07.000
RELAX, HONEY. THIS IS PROBABLY JUST
YOUR GARDEN-VARIETY RUNAWAY BRIDE.

16:07.034 --> 16:10.170
DON'T RUNAWAY BRIDES USUALLY
RUN AWAY BEFORE THE WEDDING?

16:10.203 --> 16:14.174
LENNOX, ANY WOMAN INVOLVED WITH JOE
LONGO IS ALWAYS A FLIGHT RISK.

16:17.810 --> 16:21.048
WELL, I LOOKED ALL OVER TOWN. I WENT
TO LITTLE MOSCOW, THE TOLEDO TEA ROOM

16:21.081 --> 16:23.383
- AND THEN I WENT TO COSTCO.
- YOU WENT... WHA...

16:23.416 --> 16:26.519
MY WIFE IS MISSING AND YOU'RE OUT
BUYING TOILET PAPER IN BULK?

16:26.553 --> 16:28.455
SHE LOVES COSTCO, OKAY?

16:28.488 --> 16:31.191
THE LONG LINES
REMIND HER OF HOME.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.594
- WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T COME BACK, BURKE?
- OH JOE, SHE'LL COME BACK.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.398
HOLY CRAP, SHE'S BACK!

16:38.431 --> 16:41.168
- JUST AS I PREDICTED.
- ELENA.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.303
HEY, I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.173
WHAT'S... WHAT'S
WITH THE SUITCASE?

16:46.206 --> 16:48.041
ARE WE GONNA GO ON
A REAL HONEYMOON?

16:48.075 --> 16:50.177
I HAVE MOST SADDEST NEWS.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.080
MY COWORKER, KONSTANTIN... WHO
HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG...

16:53.113 --> 16:55.182
WILL BE BLAMED FOR
PRODKO SCANDAL.

16:55.215 --> 16:58.418
- HE WILL BE FALLING MAN.
- OH, YOU MEAN FALL GUY.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.553
NOT IMPORTANT. PLEASE CONTINUE.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.523
HE WILL GO TO JAIL UNLESS I
RETURN TO RUSSIA AND TESTIFY.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.458
NO NO NO, YOU CAN'T...
YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.460
IT'S NOT SAFE FOR YOU TO RETURN THERE.
THAT'S WHY WE DID THIS WHOLE THING.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.396
CAN'T SOMEBODY ELSE DO IT?

17:09.429 --> 17:12.232
WHAT ABOUT VLADIMIR, HUH?

17:12.265 --> 17:14.367
I'D BELIEVE HIM. HE'S
GOT A VERY HONEST,

17:14.401 --> 17:16.336
UH, EYEBROW.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.472
- HE WAS WHISTLE-SUCKER.
- YOU MEAN WHISTLE-BLOWER.

17:19.506 --> 17:22.342
SORRY, I'M REALLY TRYING TO
STAY OUT OF THIS CONVERSATION.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.145
ONLY MY TESTIMONY
WILL SAVE KONSTANTIN.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.814
I MUST DO AS YOU'VE SHOWN ME.

17:27.847 --> 17:31.184
TO SAVE A FRIEND, YOU WENT
SO FAR AS TO MARRY HER.

17:31.218 --> 17:35.155
YEAH, BUT... BUT AREN'T WE A
LITTLE MORE THAN FRIENDS?

17:36.189 --> 17:37.857
TODAY WHEN I SAID I LOVED YOU,

17:37.890 --> 17:42.395
- PERHAPS I WAS TRAPPED UP IN THE MOMENT.
- CAUGHT UP.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.431
LAST ONE, I PROMISE.

17:44.464 --> 17:48.468
NOW I REALIZE WE HAVE NOT
KNOWN EACH OTHER LONG ENOUGH

17:48.501 --> 17:51.538
- TO BE TRULY IN LOVE.
- WOW.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.408
HOW MANY GUYS GET THE
LET'S-BE-FRIENDS SPEECH

17:55.442 --> 17:57.544
ACTUALLY ON THEIR WEDDING NIGHT?

17:57.577 --> 18:00.513
THE WAY YOU RESCUED
ME WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.582
LIKE FAIRY TALE.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.385
BUT NOW I MUST GO
BACK TO REALITY.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.287
I MUST GO BACK TO RUSSIA.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.656
ELENA, WAIT A MINUTE. LET ME...

18:09.689 --> 18:11.658
LET ME AT LEAST DRIVE YOU
TO THE AIRPORT, OKAY?

18:11.691 --> 18:13.560
BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST...

18:13.593 --> 18:17.297
( sighs ) YOU'RE JUST TOO
BEAUTIFUL TO TAKE A TAXI.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.432
HEY, YOU LET ME TAKE TAXIS!

18:20.633 --> 18:22.469
NO, JOSEPH,

18:22.502 --> 18:24.437
THIS MUST BE OUR GOODBYE

18:24.471 --> 18:26.439
OR I WILL NOT BE
ABLE TO LEAVE YOU.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.615
ELENA!

18:36.616 --> 18:38.351
YES?

18:39.452 --> 18:40.687
WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE TOLEDO.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.666
HEY, JOE, I'M REALLY SORRY.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.502
I KNOW IT HURTS NOW,
BUT THINK ABOUT IT...

18:55.535 --> 18:57.404
THIS WAS YOUR PLAN
ALL ALONG, RIGHT?

18:57.437 --> 18:58.571
SHE WAS GONNA GO BACK TO RUSSIA

18:58.605 --> 19:00.340
AND YOU GUYS WERE JUST
GONNA BE FRIENDS.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.909
I MEAN, NAKED ONLINE FRIENDS,
BUT WHO AM I TO JUDGE?

19:02.942 --> 19:05.512
AH, SHE WAS RIGHT. WE DIDN'T
REALLY KNOW EACH OTHER THAT WELL.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.680
I GUESS I JUST GOT CAUGHT
UP IN THE MOMENT TOO.

19:07.714 --> 19:10.483
JUST, YOU KNOW, THE
WHOLE IDEA OF MARRIAGE

19:10.517 --> 19:13.453
AND SAVING HER AND,

19:13.486 --> 19:16.489
GOD, THE WAY SHE
LOOKED IN THAT DRESS.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.691
YEAH, VERA WILL DO THAT.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.594
NO, ELENA. WHO'S VERA?

19:21.628 --> 19:23.363
WHAT? I DIDN'T SAY VERA.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.599
LOOK, JOE, ABOUT THAT
WEDDING DRESS...

19:28.568 --> 19:31.538
YOU KNOW, A PRETTY WEDDING DRESS
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S TRUE LOVE

19:31.571 --> 19:33.540
AND IT DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S THE RIGHT PERSON.

19:34.641 --> 19:37.477
I KNOW BUT... IT'S CRAZY, BURKE,

19:37.510 --> 19:39.779
'CAUSE FOR A MINUTE I THOUGHT
SHE WAS THE RIGHT PERSON.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.483
I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.752
ANYWAY, ON THE UPSIDE,
I CAN DEFINITELY RATE

19:45.785 --> 19:48.421
THIS MARRIAGE BETTER
THAN MY ONE TO TIFFANY.

19:48.455 --> 19:51.591
- YEAH, AND FAR CHEAPER.
- YEAH, THERE'S THAT TOO. YEAH.

19:51.624 --> 19:54.761
WOW. TIFFANY, ELENA...

19:54.794 --> 19:57.697
( laughs ) MAYBE THIRD
TIME'S THE CHARM, HUH?

19:57.730 --> 20:00.633
YEAH. TO THAT POOR WOMAN,
WHEREVER SHE MAY BE.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.670
YES, TO THE THIRD MRS. LONGO.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.439
( chuckles ) SHE'S PROBABLY
IN FORT LAUDERDALE RIGHT NOW,

20:06.473 --> 20:08.475
SUCKING SOME JELL-O SHOTS
OFF HER TWIN SISTER'S ABS.

20:08.508 --> 20:12.512
OR TAKING HER VERY FIRST
POLE-DANCING LESSON.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.980
- OH, THAT'S A SPECIAL MOMENT FOR ANYBODY.
- MMM.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.648
YOU'RE A TRUE ROMANTIC, JOE.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.684
- OH, YOU KNOW ME SO WELL.
- MMM. ( chuckles )

20:25.525 --> 20:28.428
- GIN!
- WHAT? WE'RE NOT EVEN PLAYING GIN.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.663
NO, I WANT GIN TO DRINK.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.799
( phone ringing )

20:34.834 --> 20:36.669
- ( beeps )
- HELLO?

20:36.703 --> 20:39.272
IT'S A COLLECT CALL FROM MRS.
LONGO.

20:39.306 --> 20:41.408
- OH, IT'S HER. IT'S HER.
- WE ACCEPT. WE ACCEPT.

20:41.441 --> 20:44.677
HEY, ELENA, HI. ANY
NEWS WITH KONSTANTIN?

20:46.446 --> 20:48.014
OH, HI, TIFFANY.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.550
HOW ARE YOU? I'M GOOD.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.419
NOT MUCH. ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:52.452 --> 20:54.321
I GOT MARRIED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
( laughs )

20:54.354 --> 20:55.522
YEAH. NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

20:55.555 --> 20:58.291
YOU'RE BETTER OFF SENDING AN
ANNULMENT GIFT NOW INSTEAD.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.560
YEAH. ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:00.593 --> 21:02.429
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL WEDDING.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.597
NOT AS BEAUTIFUL AS OUR WEDDING.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.567
YEAH, SURE.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.770
I CAN COME CHANGE
YOUR TIRE FOR YOU.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.605
ALL RIGHT, I'LL
SEE YOU IN A FEW.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.374
- BYE-BYE.
- ( beeps )

21:14.407 --> 21:16.443
JOE LONGO TO THE RESCUE?

21:16.476 --> 21:17.610
WHAT CAN I SAY, BURKE?

21:17.644 --> 21:20.680
I GOTTA GO PULL ANOTHER LADY
OUT OF A BURNING BUILDING.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.350
BAM! PICK UP SOME MILK
ON YOUR WAY HOME.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.384
BAM! YOU GOT IT.
