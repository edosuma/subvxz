00:11.464 --> 00:17.385
(grunting and moaning)

00:17.420 --> 00:19.253
Huh.

00:19.305 --> 00:20.555
Huh.

00:21.808 --> 00:23.007
This is hard to watch.

00:23.059 --> 00:24.509
- It's really...
- I'll be... I'll be honest.

00:24.561 --> 00:26.844
It actually looks like work for her,

00:26.896 --> 00:27.862
- specifically.
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.130
I thought the same thing.

00:29.165 --> 00:30.731
He is just... Ugh.

00:30.767 --> 00:32.266
I don't even know
where to begin with him.

00:32.302 --> 00:33.734
Well, first off, he's a huge man.

00:33.770 --> 00:35.736
He's the biggest man
I've ever seen, probably.

00:35.772 --> 00:37.371
And she is... Hmm.

00:37.407 --> 00:39.207
- She's much smaller than him.
- Much smaller.

00:39.242 --> 00:41.843
The disparity between these
two sizes is frightening.

00:41.878 --> 00:43.177
Frightening.

00:43.213 --> 00:45.046
So, are you ready for the party tonight?

00:45.081 --> 00:46.447
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Huh?

00:46.483 --> 00:47.815
- Come on.
- Yeah. I'm ready.

00:47.851 --> 00:49.417
You never get out of your house.

00:49.452 --> 00:50.679
I'm psyched for the p... What do

00:50.704 --> 00:51.986
you want from me, a cartwheel?

00:52.021 --> 00:53.488
No, I just think... I got tiny arms.

00:53.523 --> 00:55.823
You owe it to yourself to get
out and do some social things,

00:55.859 --> 00:57.091
so I'm just happy you're coming out.

00:57.126 --> 00:58.993
I'm happy that you're
happy that I'm here.

00:59.028 --> 01:00.194
Good.

01:00.230 --> 01:01.929
Okay, see, this is new.

01:01.965 --> 01:03.531
- Is she lowering herself...
- Yeah.

01:03.566 --> 01:04.799
Onto his face?

01:04.834 --> 01:06.934
She seems to be taking
a seat on his face.

01:06.970 --> 01:08.436
Which is... Well, it's so weird,

01:08.471 --> 01:10.705
'cause I've seen humans sit on things.

01:10.740 --> 01:11.939
Normally, it's stuff like,

01:11.975 --> 01:13.641
- like the subway or something.
- Like the subway, yeah.

01:13.676 --> 01:14.976
- I mean, like...
- Or like, chairs.

01:15.011 --> 01:16.444
- Benches. Seats.
- Benches, yeah.

01:16.479 --> 01:18.145
- Yeah, seats. Seats in general.
- Just seats.

01:18.181 --> 01:20.848
I've never seen someone seat on a face.

01:20.884 --> 01:22.583
I mean, it looks... I don't know.

01:22.619 --> 01:24.819
Eh, that's kinda...

01:24.854 --> 01:26.354
- What?
- No, nothing. It's fine.

01:26.389 --> 01:28.322
Uh, what are you bringing
to the party, by the way?

01:28.358 --> 01:31.359
Oh, um, I'm just... I
found a cracker over there.

01:31.394 --> 01:32.727
- I thought I'd...
- Oh.

01:32.762 --> 01:34.929
You know, just something, like,
everyone could kinda share.

01:34.964 --> 01:36.430
- Yeah.
- What about you?

01:36.466 --> 01:38.266
- Are you bringing anything?
- Oh, I'm bringing these guys.

01:38.301 --> 01:39.534
What are those?

01:39.569 --> 01:41.068
They... Paper plates.

01:41.104 --> 01:42.737
- It's, um...
- Hmm.

01:42.772 --> 01:44.705
Why do you have to make me feel
weird about bringing plates?

01:44.741 --> 01:46.507
- You know I'm already...
- I'm not making you feel weird.

01:46.543 --> 01:47.875
apprehensive about going to the party.

01:47.911 --> 01:48.976
Paper plates are great!

01:49.012 --> 01:50.945
- It's a utilitarian move.
- Utilitarian move.

01:50.980 --> 01:53.114
- (woman moaning, man grunting)
- Nobody ever thanks the plate guy.

01:53.182 --> 01:54.515
Nobody thanks the plate guy!

01:54.551 --> 01:55.917
I always say that.

01:55.952 --> 01:57.018
(sighs)

01:57.053 --> 01:58.219
Shit.

01:58.254 --> 01:59.487
- (body thuds)
- (moaning, grunting stops)

01:59.522 --> 02:01.055
Is she... She's not...

02:01.090 --> 02:02.757
- Oh, she's not moving.
- Yeah, no.

02:02.792 --> 02:03.792
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

02:03.826 --> 02:05.960
I guess she's, uh, tuckered out.

02:05.995 --> 02:06.589
- Yeah.
- Oh, we should

02:06.614 --> 02:07.527
actually probably be quiet,

02:07.564 --> 02:09.330
- Oh, yeah. Right.
- 'cause she's probably trying to sleep.

02:09.365 --> 02:10.764
- You wanna get out of here?
- Yeah, let's go.

02:10.800 --> 02:11.800
- Cool.
- Follow me.

Oh, see, man, this is
what I'm talking about.

02:29.218 --> 02:31.018
Already I'm not feeling it.

02:31.054 --> 02:32.753
It's organized fun, basically.

02:32.789 --> 02:34.789
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- It's like, you sit over there,

02:34.824 --> 02:35.984
then you get food over there

02:36.009 --> 02:37.024
- by the punch bowls
- Yeah.

02:37.060 --> 02:38.125
And the snacks,

02:38.161 --> 02:39.860
- and over here you dance.
- Right.

02:39.896 --> 02:41.629
It's like... I don't want
to deal with this all night.

02:41.664 --> 02:43.097
- I can't...
- Okay, you're thinking way too much.

02:43.132 --> 02:44.565
Just calm down,

02:44.601 --> 02:46.133
- All right.
- and just try to enjoy yourself.

02:46.169 --> 02:47.168
- All right.
- Not a big deal.

02:47.203 --> 02:48.502
Promise me you're gonna stick with me?

02:48.538 --> 02:50.504
Like, don't leave me
hanging high and dry.

02:50.540 --> 02:51.739
- Okay, yes. All right.
- All right.

02:51.774 --> 02:54.041
Oh, shit! Now this party's starting!

02:54.077 --> 02:55.077
Mike's here!

02:55.111 --> 02:57.078
- (laughing)
- Here he is.

02:57.113 --> 02:58.913
- The king.
- Oh, yeah.

02:58.948 --> 02:59.948
What is up, Fink?

02:59.983 --> 03:02.149
Mike, I am thrilled to see you.

03:02.185 --> 03:03.584
- What's up, Fink?
- Hey, Phil.

03:03.620 --> 03:06.120
I mean, this party is
gonna be off the chain.

03:06.155 --> 03:07.155
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

03:07.156 --> 03:08.856
I've got... DJ Lab
Rat's gonna spin.

03:08.891 --> 03:10.224
We've got games planned.

03:10.259 --> 03:13.260
It's gonna be, like,
super organized, super fun.

03:13.296 --> 03:14.562
Mmm. Phil loves organized fun.

03:14.597 --> 03:15.997
- Really?
- It's right up my alley.

03:16.032 --> 03:18.265
You know, we actually
brought some stuff, too.

03:18.301 --> 03:20.668
I totally forgot. I brought
a cracker for everybody.

03:20.703 --> 03:23.037
- I just thought I...
- Are you fucking kidding me, right now?

03:23.072 --> 03:24.839
- It's not a big deal, it's...
- No, no, no.

03:24.874 --> 03:26.374
Do not downplay this, Mike.

03:26.409 --> 03:28.242
This is a huge deal.

03:28.277 --> 03:30.945
Guys, Mike brought a cracker!

03:30.980 --> 03:32.213
(cheering)

03:32.248 --> 03:33.280
Rat: You da man, Mike!

03:33.316 --> 03:34.949
We're gonna eat like kings, tonight.

03:34.984 --> 03:35.984
Thank you, so much.

03:36.019 --> 03:37.184
- Hey, Fink,
- Thank you, so much.

03:37.220 --> 03:39.120
I br... I brought paper plates.

03:39.155 --> 03:40.254
- What is that?
- Paper plates?

03:40.289 --> 03:41.355
Why?

03:41.391 --> 03:43.524
To pu... put the food on...

03:43.559 --> 03:45.660
so people don't have
to eat off the floor.

03:45.695 --> 03:47.795
So, what are we thinking? We
got some ladies here tonight?

03:47.830 --> 03:50.264
Oh, bro, are you ready to make babies?

03:50.299 --> 03:52.333
This guy is like, the
king of making babies.

03:52.368 --> 03:53.634
- You are, Fink.
- Oh...

03:53.670 --> 03:55.069
- I'm telling you.
- He is. It's true, though.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.071
You know, what, thank you, man.
Dude, I had twins last week.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.272
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, snap.

03:58.307 --> 03:59.940
They were born, like, a second apart.

03:59.976 --> 04:02.610
Their mom was fertile as shit.

04:02.645 --> 04:04.178
Ah, that's... You're the king.

04:04.213 --> 04:05.713
(coughs) I kid you not, last weekend,

04:05.748 --> 04:07.314
made babies with the
chick from the six train.

04:07.350 --> 04:08.382
- What?
- Yeah.

04:08.418 --> 04:09.617
- Northbound or southbound?
- Southbound.

04:09.652 --> 04:10.685
Oh, shit!

04:10.720 --> 04:12.019
(laughing)

04:12.055 --> 04:15.556
Oh, yeah, no, totally, I remember
when I was making babies, um...

04:15.591 --> 04:17.892
The other day I was upstate, right?

04:17.927 --> 04:19.760
- And, um...
- Where?

04:19.796 --> 04:20.961
Syracuse.

04:20.997 --> 04:22.730
- Like, in the Syracuse region.
- Wow. How'd you get up there?

04:22.765 --> 04:24.065
That's like, real far.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.966
Like, a train, or whatever. That's
not really the important part...

04:26.002 --> 04:27.268
- You got on a train?
- Yeah.

04:27.303 --> 04:28.569
That's not, like, the Amtrak line.

04:28.604 --> 04:29.704
- How did you...
- Yeah, no, it's fine.

04:29.739 --> 04:30.905
Did you get on a Metro North train?

04:30.940 --> 04:32.106
It doesn't matter how I got there,

04:32.141 --> 04:34.141
but I got there and I met a chick,

04:34.177 --> 04:36.410
and then I made like...

04:36.446 --> 04:39.013
th... f... six.

04:39.048 --> 04:41.048
I had six babies at once.

04:41.084 --> 04:42.283
Me and her.

04:42.318 --> 04:45.519
And we... They just came out. (whistles)

04:45.555 --> 04:48.656
It was like, you thought they
were done, but it was just...

04:48.691 --> 04:49.790
more and more, like...

04:49.826 --> 04:51.692
Okay, so real quick,
so you got on a train,

04:51.728 --> 04:53.178
and you went upstate,
the train thing again.

04:53.203 --> 04:53.661
Oh my God,

04:53.696 --> 04:55.196
- Let's just drop it.
- ... to Syracuse.

04:55.231 --> 04:57.331
Well, see, that's where
it starts to fall apart.

04:57.366 --> 04:57.841
Uh-huh.

04:57.866 --> 04:59.266
The part where they all arrive at once.

04:59.302 --> 05:01.035
What are we talking about
falling apart? We're just...

05:01.070 --> 05:03.037
I didn't poke holes
in your guys' stories.

05:03.072 --> 05:04.905
Phillip, have you not
made babies before?

05:04.941 --> 05:05.984
- What?
- Oh, Phil has

05:06.009 --> 05:07.374
100% not made babies.

05:07.410 --> 05:09.343
All right, okay, so what? Big whoop.

05:09.378 --> 05:12.046
- I have never made babies before.
- Oh, shit.

05:12.081 --> 05:13.781
All right, you guys figure this out.

05:13.816 --> 05:15.783
I'm gonna go jerk my dong off,

05:15.818 --> 05:18.152
so that I can last longer
when I'm ready to make babies

05:18.187 --> 05:20.054
with every woman at this party.

05:20.089 --> 05:22.556
Don't worry, I'll
leave one for you, Phil.

05:22.558 --> 05:23.891
That's great.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.559
That guy's a fucking asshole.

05:25.595 --> 05:26.595
Oh, he's not bad.

05:26.629 --> 05:27.895
No, this is terrible.

05:27.930 --> 05:29.697
Dude, don't worry,
you're my best friend,

05:29.732 --> 05:31.532
and I'm gonna make you a father tonight.

05:31.567 --> 05:34.535
All right. That.. That
sounds good. Thank you.

Greg made it up to the
horse racing majors.

- No shit.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.343
Thoroughbred racing, that guy?

05:59.395 --> 06:01.729
I'm not a guy to say he didn't
deserve it, but he doesn't deserve it.

06:01.764 --> 06:03.481
No. We're faster runners than him.

06:03.516 --> 06:06.767
If you and I were there, we'd
be blowing him in the dust.

06:06.769 --> 06:09.103
I had a shot. There was some guys
sniffing around a few years ago.

06:09.105 --> 06:10.237
I saw that. I remember that.

06:10.273 --> 06:11.906
I remember, and you were good.

06:11.941 --> 06:14.775
Thank you. I just wanted...
I guess I like the 9-5.

06:14.827 --> 06:16.243
You know, I like the regular...

06:16.279 --> 06:17.279
I am with you.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.579
Do the job, retire.

06:18.614 --> 06:19.864
And our day is never the same.

06:19.916 --> 06:21.949
Like, one day you'll be sitting
outside a domestic dispute,

06:22.001 --> 06:24.702
the other day you're down on Wall
Street stepping on some hippies.

06:24.754 --> 06:27.204
Hey, and another day, guess what? We
get the benefit of the whole thing,

06:27.256 --> 06:28.956
we still get to do parades.

06:28.991 --> 06:30.291
- I love parade duty.
- I love parades.

06:30.326 --> 06:32.259
I'll take that over running
around a mile-and-a-quarter track.

06:32.295 --> 06:33.815
And now there are so many more parades.

06:33.830 --> 06:34.962
The gay pride parade,

06:34.997 --> 06:36.130
- the St. Patty's day.
- St. Patty's,

06:36.165 --> 06:37.698
- Love that one.
- Fourth of July parade,

06:37.733 --> 06:39.033
Puerto Rican pride.

06:39.068 --> 06:41.702
Hey, look, if the Yankees,
Rangers, or the Knicks win...

06:41.737 --> 06:43.504
You know what we'll
never do? A Mets parade.

06:43.539 --> 06:45.472
- No, they will never...
- They're terrible this year.

06:45.508 --> 06:49.276
No, no, no, my, uh, my father's
father was in the '86 Mets parade.

06:49.312 --> 06:51.178
- Was he?
- They tried to get him to do blow.

06:51.214 --> 06:52.479
- Who, Gooden?
- Gooden.

06:52.515 --> 06:53.494
- Really?
- Yeah, he tried to

06:53.519 --> 06:54.748
give my father's friend blow.

06:54.784 --> 06:56.184
- Not even horse tranquilizer.
- No.

06:56.185 --> 06:57.918
They were just...
Anything that could sniff,

06:57.954 --> 06:59.954
- Yeah.
- they were shoving coke up it.

06:59.989 --> 07:02.423
But Greg's gonna miss out on all that.

07:02.458 --> 07:04.458
I'll blow my brains out
if Greg gets super famous.

07:04.493 --> 07:05.493
- I'm not kidding.
- Ugh.

07:05.528 --> 07:06.961
I will blow my brains out.

07:06.996 --> 07:08.762
I'll hold the gun and
I'll turn it on myself.

07:08.798 --> 07:09.997
- Please.
- I will do that.

07:10.032 --> 07:12.392
- Let's make a suicide pact right now.
- Really. Oh, my God.

07:14.670 --> 07:15.669
- All right, man, look.
- Yeah.

07:15.671 --> 07:17.171
Making babies really isn't that hard.

07:17.206 --> 07:19.340
Okay. All you have to
do is just be yourself.

07:19.375 --> 07:20.608
- That's it?
- Yeah.

07:20.643 --> 07:22.676
That's not really instructions
or anything. You told me you...

07:22.712 --> 07:24.178
You want me to give
you a step-by-step...

07:24.213 --> 07:25.813
I... No. Nah, that's not...

07:25.848 --> 07:27.314
Here. Watch this, okay?

07:27.350 --> 07:29.683
I will show you by doing.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.154
Okay, he's walking over,

07:34.190 --> 07:36.156
talking to her. Yeah, okay, cool.

07:36.192 --> 07:38.025
"Hey, what's up? My name's Mike.

07:38.027 --> 07:40.060
"Do you wanna make babies with me?

07:40.096 --> 07:42.029
"Maybe we'll go in the
bathroom, and then..."

07:42.031 --> 07:44.031
Uh, okay, and they're
actually in the bathroom.

07:44.083 --> 07:45.083
Oh, that's great.

07:45.084 --> 07:46.166
Hey, man, who are you talking to?

07:46.202 --> 07:47.868
No one. Hey, Fink,
what's happening, man?

07:47.920 --> 07:48.953
You okay, man?

07:49.005 --> 07:50.704
- Yeah.
- You look sweaty and nervous.

07:50.740 --> 07:52.506
I'll be honest with you, I'm
a little anxious, I guess.

07:52.541 --> 07:54.008
Yeah, 'cause you've
never made babies before?

07:54.043 --> 07:55.976
No, okay, just stop reiterating that.

07:56.012 --> 07:57.311
We don't need to have everyone hear.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.946
Oh, everybody knows. I've
been telling everybody.

07:58.981 --> 08:00.214
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:00.249 --> 08:02.283
Ever since I found out, this is
the best piece of information.

08:02.318 --> 08:04.685
I'm using it as a currency
to curry favor with everybody.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.287
I'm glad it's working in
the benefit of someone.

08:06.322 --> 08:08.155
- Oh, no, it's working great for me.
- Oh, good.

08:08.190 --> 08:09.223
All right, here's the deal.

08:09.258 --> 08:10.691
I'm gonna make this a
little easier for you.

08:10.726 --> 08:12.293
Yeah, what are you... Take one of these.

08:12.328 --> 08:15.195
What is that? What, don't ask
what it is, okay? It's a blue pill.

08:15.231 --> 08:16.797
- Where'd you get it from?
- I found it.

08:16.832 --> 08:18.832
I found a whole bunch of blue
pills on the ground, okay?

08:18.868 --> 08:20.167
- Okay...
- I've been taking them all night,

08:20.202 --> 08:22.803
they've been making me
rock hard and ready to go.

08:22.838 --> 08:24.204
You know what, I
actually don't need drugs.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.007
I'm just gonna follow the
info that Mike gave me.

08:27.043 --> 08:28.075
Okay, which is what?

08:28.110 --> 08:30.577
Uh, being... be... Just gonna be myself.

08:30.613 --> 08:31.745
- That's great advice...
- Yeah.

08:31.781 --> 08:33.381
If you don't want to
make babies tonight.

08:33.381 --> 08:34.339
- No, I...
- 'Cause you've been

08:34.364 --> 08:35.524
yourself for your whole life,

08:35.551 --> 08:36.784
and you've never made babies.

08:36.818 --> 08:38.585
So, why would that stop working now?

08:38.621 --> 08:40.654
Because Mike said it,
and now I'm gonna use it,

08:40.690 --> 08:42.155
and it's like a gusto sort of thing.

08:42.191 --> 08:43.424
Yeah, I'm fine, okay, Fink?

08:43.458 --> 08:45.259
Fine. I'm out.

08:45.261 --> 08:46.460
(mutters) Fuck me.

08:46.495 --> 08:47.995
Phil, Phil, look at this.

08:48.030 --> 08:49.030
Oh, my God.

08:49.031 --> 08:50.731
- Come here, look at this, huh?
- Jesus Christ!

08:50.766 --> 08:51.730
- Look at this!
- You just

08:51.755 --> 08:53.000
made that in the bathroom?

08:53.035 --> 08:54.268
This is my daughter Rebecca.

08:54.337 --> 08:55.337
You're a father.

08:55.338 --> 08:56.937
You know, when you see them smile...

08:56.973 --> 08:58.639
Oh, your voice is different, too.

08:58.674 --> 09:01.141
It really connects your
place in the universe in a way

09:01.177 --> 09:02.294
- What happened to you?
- you tend to

09:02.319 --> 09:03.510
remember, you know? It grounds you.

09:03.546 --> 09:04.611
This is terrible.

09:04.647 --> 09:06.207
Oh, she's looking at you. Look at this.

09:07.650 --> 09:08.949
Hi, baby.

09:08.985 --> 09:10.851
- Mommy.
- No!

09:10.886 --> 09:12.186
- Aww, her first words!
- No, no, no, no!

09:12.221 --> 09:14.421
- That's not... That's not me.
- Aww, she called you Mommy.

09:14.457 --> 09:15.622
I don't think that's what she said.

09:15.658 --> 09:16.267
I actually...

09:16.292 --> 09:18.093
Oh, that's right, he is a little mommy.

09:18.127 --> 09:19.927
- I'm not a mo...
- You know what? I'm gonna go.

09:19.962 --> 09:22.997
(music playing) <i>DJ Lab Rat.</i>

09:23.032 --> 09:24.465
<i>DJ. Lab Rat.</i>

09:24.500 --> 09:25.632
<i>Lab Rat.</i>

09:25.668 --> 09:27.835
How's everyone doing? Crowd check in.

09:27.870 --> 09:30.871
Just so everyone
knows, I do accept tips.

09:30.906 --> 09:33.640
Throw a few pennies in
that tip jar, everyone.

09:33.676 --> 09:37.211
And pennies is obviously a
metaphor for dollar bills.

09:37.246 --> 09:38.345
All right.

09:38.381 --> 09:40.414
Who likes Avril Lavigne?

09:40.449 --> 09:42.616
(music resumes)

09:42.651 --> 09:43.560
Hey, what's happening,

09:43.585 --> 09:44.718
- man, how's it going?
- Hey.

09:44.754 --> 09:46.220
- Good. Good, yeah.
- Good, yeah, awesome.

09:46.255 --> 09:47.554
Totally.

09:47.590 --> 09:48.622
(clears throat)

09:48.657 --> 09:50.324
How's this party for you?

09:50.359 --> 09:51.658
- Oh, it's fun, yeah.
- Yeah?

09:51.694 --> 09:53.660
- I got a couple friends here, so...
- Totally.

09:53.696 --> 09:54.816
- That's great.
- Yeah, we're having

09:54.841 --> 09:55.796
a good time, hanging out.

09:55.831 --> 09:57.231
- Yeah.
- Yeah, are you having fun?

09:57.266 --> 09:59.500
Uh... Not really,

09:59.535 --> 10:00.968
- actually. Um...
- Oh.

10:01.003 --> 10:03.203
Just generally, I like being alone

10:03.239 --> 10:05.406
more than, like, with a group
of people and stuff like that.

10:05.441 --> 10:08.275
Like, I'd rather be like,
basically, like, at my house,

10:08.310 --> 10:09.910
but not like Son of Sam,
or anything like that.

10:09.945 --> 10:11.311
- Uh-huh. - I'm
not like a weirdo.

10:11.347 --> 10:14.314
I'm not gonna stay up all
night and just, like, by myself

10:14.350 --> 10:17.484
just sort of like, strangling
myself. Just like, I'm not, like,

10:17.520 --> 10:18.619
nuts.

10:18.654 --> 10:20.187
I'm not nuts.

10:20.222 --> 10:21.388
Right.

10:21.424 --> 10:23.690
- Um... Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

10:23.726 --> 10:25.325
- That's stupid.
- No, that's okay.

10:25.361 --> 10:28.062
I understand parties
can be overwhelming.

10:28.097 --> 10:29.496
- It's tough, you know?
- Yeah.

10:29.532 --> 10:31.999
Um, you know what? I actually...
I see a friend of mine over there,

10:32.034 --> 10:33.367
so I think I'm gonna go chat with her.

10:33.402 --> 10:34.935
Oh, cool, yeah, I'll join you guys.

10:34.970 --> 10:37.738
Uh, I think we're probably
gonna go to the bathroom.

10:37.773 --> 10:39.773
Oh, my God. This is really happening.

10:39.809 --> 10:41.642
It's as quick as Mike said it would be.

10:41.677 --> 10:43.944
Uh, all right, I'm down.

10:43.979 --> 10:45.279
I'll watch you two first,

10:45.314 --> 10:47.347
and then, you know, whenever I
feel ready, I'll warm myself up,

10:47.383 --> 10:48.615
and then I'll just join in with you.

10:48.651 --> 10:49.850
- It'll be great.
- (shocked) What?

10:49.885 --> 10:52.219
I figured we were going
to the bathroom together...

10:52.254 --> 10:53.187
- Oh, my God!
- Okay...

10:53.222 --> 10:55.189
- I want everyone at this party,
- That's fine.

10:55.224 --> 10:56.390
- everyone!
- No, no, no.

10:56.425 --> 10:56.792
This guy

10:56.817 --> 10:57.892
Don't make an announcement. That's fine.

10:57.927 --> 10:59.760
- is a pervert!
- No, I'm not.

10:59.795 --> 11:02.663
- He is a sick, disgusting deviant!
- No, no, I...

11:02.698 --> 11:04.132
- It's fine, I didn't mean...
- He wants to

11:04.157 --> 11:05.597
stand and watch us go to the bathroom

11:05.601 --> 11:07.135
and stroke himself like

11:07.160 --> 11:08.735
- a fucking maniac!
- No.

11:08.771 --> 11:09.764
- Please, stop this.
- He's the

11:09.789 --> 11:10.909
reason I started hating men,

11:10.940 --> 11:12.106
- Please, stop yelling at me.
- And now,

11:12.141 --> 11:16.043
I loathe this guy! Stay away from him.

11:17.947 --> 11:20.948
Yeah, totally, that guy is
a pervert. He's so gross.

11:20.983 --> 11:22.316
I saved her from the pervert,

11:22.351 --> 11:24.751
so I don't know who she's talking
about exactly. It's not me.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.088
Nice.

11:28.124 --> 11:30.724
Look at you with the
fingerpainting. You are a natural.

11:30.759 --> 11:32.626
My daughter's a natural at this.

11:32.661 --> 11:35.262
I am drawing the trash.

11:35.297 --> 11:37.164
Aww, our trash.

11:37.199 --> 11:39.133
(chuckling) It's our trash.

11:39.168 --> 11:40.801
Is that your daughter?

11:40.836 --> 11:43.303
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's Rebecca.

11:43.339 --> 11:45.772
She's my... She's my little one. Yeah.

11:45.808 --> 11:47.107
You have a way with children.

11:47.143 --> 11:49.443
You should have more, don't you think?

11:49.445 --> 11:51.745
Uh... (nervous laughter)

11:51.780 --> 11:54.448
That's... I... I see...
I see what you're doing.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.333
I saw you across the room and I just...

11:56.368 --> 12:00.037
Well, I was wondering if you'd like to
go into the bathroom and make babies.

12:00.089 --> 12:02.122
Oh, my God.

12:02.124 --> 12:03.457
Is it getting hot in here?

12:03.459 --> 12:04.625
Ha. I just...

12:04.677 --> 12:07.344
Um, look, I... You're very beautiful.

12:07.379 --> 12:09.796
You know, I think right now I'm
just sort of in the head space

12:09.798 --> 12:11.965
of concentrating on my little
Rebecca, you know? So...

12:12.017 --> 12:13.967
Well, please know at any point,

12:13.969 --> 12:16.186
if you'd like to come visit
me, I'll be in the bathroom

12:16.222 --> 12:18.772
getting my downstairs ready
if you change your mind.

12:18.807 --> 12:20.774
Your downstairs ready?

12:20.809 --> 12:22.359
That's a ref...

12:22.394 --> 12:24.645
That's like, a play on words
thing you're doing, right?

12:24.647 --> 12:26.196
Yes. Yes, it is.

12:26.232 --> 12:29.449
Sorry, I'm a little unclear
on entendres sometimes.

12:29.485 --> 12:31.535
Well, let's get you really clear.

12:31.570 --> 12:34.738
Let's get you really, really clear.

12:34.790 --> 12:36.957
- The clear part is another entendre?
- Yes.

12:36.992 --> 12:37.992
- Got it.
- Mm-hmm.

12:38.043 --> 12:39.793
- That one's a little unclear.
- Yeah. Yes.

12:39.828 --> 12:41.828
- That entendre was a little unclear.
- I realize that now

12:41.881 --> 12:43.330
after I said it.

12:43.382 --> 12:45.916
I came on him, and uh...

12:45.968 --> 12:47.134
it was too late.

12:47.169 --> 12:48.502
- You know?
- Aww.

12:48.554 --> 12:49.586
The trap had already sprung.

12:49.638 --> 12:50.804
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my gosh.

12:50.839 --> 12:51.972
His neck was snapped.

12:52.007 --> 12:54.341
There was blood coming out
of his ears and his mouth.

12:54.376 --> 12:55.509
- That's horrible.
- That's awful.

12:55.544 --> 12:57.177
He was my brother, you know?

12:57.213 --> 12:58.212
I was supposed to look after him.

12:58.247 --> 12:59.247
- Yes.
- Yeah.

12:59.281 --> 13:00.514
But he was dead.

13:00.549 --> 13:02.216
I mean, don't get me
wrong, I ate the cheese.

13:02.251 --> 13:03.984
- Well, you can't pass up the cheese.
- Well, you have to.

13:04.019 --> 13:05.385
You can't pass up
the... You guys get it.

13:05.421 --> 13:06.421
- Yeah.
- Totally.

13:06.455 --> 13:08.155
But, you know, that loss,

13:08.190 --> 13:09.255
I feel like there's a hole in my heart

13:09.280 --> 13:10.457
that I don't know if
I'll ever fill again.

13:10.492 --> 13:12.459
- You're damaged.
- Oh, yeah.

13:12.494 --> 13:13.794
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

13:13.829 --> 13:15.529
Oh, yeah.

13:15.564 --> 13:17.231
Oh, yeah.

13:17.266 --> 13:19.633
Like, the back. It's lumbar.
That's the word I was looking for.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.068
Lumbar. I couldn't think for a second.

13:21.103 --> 13:23.036
Could you just hold
my hand for a minute?

13:23.072 --> 13:24.404
Uh, yeah.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.073
- Thank you.
- All right, yeah, yeah.

13:26.108 --> 13:27.674
- Thank you so much.
- That's great.

13:27.710 --> 13:29.209
- This is...
- Okay, that helps.

13:29.245 --> 13:30.544
- That's good.
- Yeah, tot...

13:30.579 --> 13:31.549
Uh, okay. You have something

13:31.574 --> 13:32.312
- coming out of
- Okay.

13:32.348 --> 13:33.513
What looks like your butt.

13:33.549 --> 13:36.183
- Ah!
- Oh, that's a little head.

13:36.218 --> 13:37.320
- Oh, it's coming!
- That's just a

13:37.345 --> 13:38.752
little head coming out of your butt.

13:38.787 --> 13:40.621
You're making babies.
I'm putting it together.

13:40.656 --> 13:41.888
- Pull it out of me!
- Okay.

13:41.924 --> 13:42.924
(straining)

13:42.958 --> 13:43.958
Ugh!

13:43.993 --> 13:45.492
Oh, my God, we did it.

13:45.527 --> 13:46.927
- Yeah, we did it.
- We did it.

13:46.962 --> 13:48.695
- We did do it.
- We did it!

13:48.731 --> 13:50.697
- Oh, my God.
- You are amazing!

13:50.733 --> 13:52.599
You're the amazing one.

13:52.635 --> 13:54.434
Who are you?

13:54.470 --> 13:56.403
Just a... Just a guy.

13:56.438 --> 13:57.748
Oh, my God! Sweetheart, give me a kiss!

13:57.773 --> 13:58.305
Who's this guy?

13:58.340 --> 13:59.773
You look beautiful!
And look at my little...

13:59.808 --> 14:00.728
I'm so happy that you're here!

14:00.753 --> 14:01.341
What's happening?

14:01.377 --> 14:03.343
(kissing)

14:03.379 --> 14:05.379
- I love you.
- This is really a good moment.

14:05.414 --> 14:06.546
Thank you, nurse, really.

14:06.582 --> 14:09.249
Uh, actually, I'm not a nurse. Uh...

14:09.285 --> 14:11.118
You're right. You're a hero.

14:11.153 --> 14:12.185
You're a hero.

14:12.221 --> 14:13.887
I was just called a
pervert a second ago.

14:13.922 --> 14:16.790
- The Weinsteins are indebted to you.
- Yes.

14:16.825 --> 14:18.492
You guys are married, so this is a...

14:18.527 --> 14:20.093
- Oh, yes, this is my husband.
- Yeah, this is a family.

14:20.129 --> 14:21.129
- Great.
- Yeah.

14:21.163 --> 14:22.462
- That is great to meet you.
- Yeah. Georgie.

14:22.498 --> 14:23.898
- I'm Phil, by the way.
- Hey, Phil.

14:23.899 --> 14:24.965
- This is great.
- How you doing?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.667
Well, you guys have a great night.

14:26.702 --> 14:27.768
This is a great family.

14:27.803 --> 14:29.503
One more and you got a basketball team.

14:29.538 --> 14:30.937
- (laughing)
- Absolutely.

14:30.973 --> 14:33.340
- You're a good man, Phil.
- Thanks, George.

14:33.375 --> 14:35.275
Oh, yeah. I got shit to do.

14:35.327 --> 14:36.327
Dad, I'm hungry.

14:36.362 --> 14:37.577
All right, all right, honey.

14:37.613 --> 14:40.414
We got some steak and
eggs for you right here.

14:40.449 --> 14:43.283
- What? Dad!
- I am a vegetarian!

14:43.285 --> 14:44.418
- Hey, Mike?
- I can't...

14:44.453 --> 14:46.169
- I told you this.
- keep track of all these phases.

14:46.205 --> 14:47.205
- Mike? Hey, Mike?
- Phil.

14:47.256 --> 14:48.455
- Hey, how's it going, dude?
- Hi.

14:48.507 --> 14:49.247
Listen, I've been following

14:49.272 --> 14:50.123
- what you were
saying, - Uh-huh?

14:50.159 --> 14:51.126
And it's not really working out

14:51.151 --> 14:52.093
- exactly how I planned.
- Okay.

14:52.127 --> 14:55.462
I think maybe if I introduced
some sort of music element...

14:55.497 --> 14:57.064
Yeah. Phil, listen, I'm sorry, man.

14:57.099 --> 14:58.565
I just need your help.
I just need your help!

14:58.590 --> 14:59.266
I'm so, sorry, dude.

14:59.301 --> 15:00.239
- I just need your help.
- I can't

15:00.264 --> 15:01.302
really do this right now, okay?

15:01.337 --> 15:04.171
Okay, but you told me to just
be myself and I'm being myself...

15:04.206 --> 15:05.872
Well, Phil, maybe y
ourself isn't that good.

15:05.908 --> 15:07.307
Maybe you're not that good.

15:07.343 --> 15:09.676
I don't know. What do you want me
to say? I don't have all the answers.

15:09.712 --> 15:11.111
- Jesus!
- You know what?

15:11.146 --> 15:11.931
You're a real fucking piece of

15:11.956 --> 15:12.846
- work, you know that?
- Okay, Phil.

15:12.881 --> 15:14.247
You have one fucking kid

15:14.283 --> 15:15.849
and you just leave me high and dry.

15:15.884 --> 15:17.150
You said you wouldn't leave me!

15:17.186 --> 15:18.919
- (smoke alarm beeping)
- You're still cooking a steak, Dad.

15:18.954 --> 15:20.156
I don't know how many times I need to

15:20.181 --> 15:21.421
- tell you
- This looks like a lot of fun.

15:21.457 --> 15:23.290
- I don't eat this shit.
- I'm getting the fuck out of here.

15:23.325 --> 15:24.991
Yeah, well, just go.

15:25.027 --> 15:26.960
Rebecca, did I hear you curse?

15:26.995 --> 15:31.915
♪ Oh, Franklin the flirt ♪

15:31.967 --> 15:37.137
♪ I understand the hurt ♪

15:37.172 --> 15:40.774
♪ That you would speak about ♪

15:40.809 --> 15:47.848

me all figured out ♪

15:54.022 --> 15:56.022
Yeah. (hiccups)

15:56.024 --> 15:58.024
Fink, Fink, hey, man.

15:58.026 --> 15:59.826
Hey, dude, how's it going?

15:59.862 --> 16:01.027
(coughing) Great.

16:01.063 --> 16:02.262
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:02.297 --> 16:03.764
You don't look like
you're doing that good.

16:03.799 --> 16:05.031
Nah, I'm doing great, actually.

16:05.067 --> 16:06.233
I'm just a little wiped out.

16:06.268 --> 16:08.201
I just made babies with all
five of those girls over there.

16:08.237 --> 16:09.605
- (coughing)
- Wow. Speaking of

16:09.630 --> 16:11.071
which, why I came over here.

16:11.106 --> 16:13.373
I'm actually looking for one of
those blue pills you had earlier.

16:13.409 --> 16:14.764
- Ugh.
- You know, one of those that

16:14.789 --> 16:16.076
make you relaxed, confident.

16:16.111 --> 16:18.378
Make girls like you, your dad
respect you, and all that type of stuff.

16:18.414 --> 16:20.235
Uh, yeah, I got a blue
pill, but it doesn't

16:20.260 --> 16:22.015
do any of that stuff that you just said.

16:22.050 --> 16:24.050
Well, hey, regardless,
I just want, you know,

16:24.086 --> 16:26.420
the thing that you had earlier.

16:26.455 --> 16:27.554
- You sure?
- Yeah.

16:27.589 --> 16:28.622
Yeah, give it to me, man.

16:28.657 --> 16:30.524
All right, have fun.

16:30.559 --> 16:31.925
(sighs) All right.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.460
- You nervous?
- No, I'm not nervous.

16:33.495 --> 16:34.694
- (coughing)
- I'm totally cool about it.

16:34.730 --> 16:37.197
Don't be nervous. Bro, look at me.

16:37.232 --> 16:38.565
Look at me, br... (coughs)

16:38.600 --> 16:40.100
- Look at me, bro.
- Yeah.

16:40.135 --> 16:42.502
This is how awesome you could look

16:42.538 --> 16:44.304
- Yeah.
- in like, an hour.

16:44.339 --> 16:45.572
Yeah, that's a good point.

16:45.607 --> 16:47.741
Take the pill and then come find me

16:47.776 --> 16:49.676
because we're gonna be looking great.

16:49.711 --> 16:50.991
- (laughing)
- That's right, man.

16:51.013 --> 16:52.813
Me and Fink hanging out.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.748
- (coughing)
- No Mike. Yeah.

16:54.783 --> 16:55.916
Totally.

16:55.968 --> 16:57.467
Oh, too much pussy.

16:58.470 --> 16:59.853
Here we go, Phil.

16:59.888 --> 17:02.055
Gulp.

17:02.090 --> 17:03.457
- (gun cocks, shoots)
- (screaming)

17:03.492 --> 17:04.624
<i>Lab Rat!</i>

17:04.660 --> 17:07.294
What is up, party people?

17:07.329 --> 17:11.598
Like to just throw a shout out to
Jarrod for lending me that XLR cable.

17:11.633 --> 17:13.800
It's really working out great.

17:13.836 --> 17:16.102
So, thanks to Jarrod.
This one's for you.

17:16.137 --> 17:17.537
(electronic music plays)

17:17.573 --> 17:18.839
All right.

17:18.874 --> 17:20.540
I actually think it's kicking in.

17:20.576 --> 17:21.842
Maybe I'll just go ahead and...

17:21.877 --> 17:23.210
Oh! Whoa!

17:23.244 --> 17:25.212
Didn't know I had that in me, did you?

17:25.247 --> 17:26.713
Ah! Ooh, ah!

17:26.748 --> 17:28.915
Philly is back in it, bitch!

17:28.951 --> 17:30.383
I'm sorry, that was too much.

17:30.419 --> 17:32.052
I'll reel it back a little bit.

17:32.087 --> 17:33.687
Chicka-chicka-chicka, pah-pah!

17:33.722 --> 17:35.055
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, my gosh.

17:35.090 --> 17:37.390
That was weird, I was just walking
backwards when I should have been...

17:37.426 --> 17:38.558
- Sorry,
- walking forwards.

17:38.594 --> 17:39.593
And I was doing a twist thing,

17:39.628 --> 17:40.627
- which I never do.
- Yeah, no.

17:40.662 --> 17:42.062
It was actually really good.

17:42.097 --> 17:43.296
Oh, I shouldn't have done it.

17:43.332 --> 17:45.932
Yeah, how's it going? How
are you enjoying the party?

17:45.968 --> 17:48.301
Oh. You know, it's a party.

17:48.337 --> 17:49.336
- Yeah, I know.
- I don't know,

17:49.371 --> 17:51.271
I feel like I've lived
my whole life at parties.

17:51.306 --> 17:53.039
I know, I feel like
parties are just, like,

17:53.075 --> 17:54.407
organized fun.

17:54.443 --> 17:57.310
You know what, though? I am
so happy this party has plates.

17:57.346 --> 17:58.845
- (angelic chorus)
- Shut the fuck up.

17:58.881 --> 18:00.247
Are you fucking serious?

18:00.282 --> 18:01.481
I brought the plates!

18:01.517 --> 18:02.582
You're the plate guy?

18:02.618 --> 18:03.917
Yes, I brought the plates!

18:03.952 --> 18:05.352
- Oh, my God!
- I know, it's such a rarity.

18:05.387 --> 18:06.786
Like, I always say, like,

18:06.822 --> 18:08.889
- Nobody thanks the plate guy!
- "Nobody thanks the plate guy." Yeah.

18:08.924 --> 18:10.156
Thanks, plate guy.

18:10.192 --> 18:11.892
Whoa.

18:11.927 --> 18:12.985
Okay, if you're having
a baby, I should let

18:13.010 --> 18:13.994
you know that I'm not a certified nurse,

18:14.029 --> 18:15.395
but I have just done this before, so...

18:15.430 --> 18:17.197
Oh, uh, no.

18:17.232 --> 18:17.861
- No.
- Oh, you were just

18:17.886 --> 18:18.431
holding my hand.

18:18.467 --> 18:19.499
- Yeah.
- Oh.

18:19.535 --> 18:20.734
I, uh...

18:20.769 --> 18:22.769
I've never made babies.

18:22.804 --> 18:25.105
I've actually never made babies either.

18:25.140 --> 18:26.140
- You haven't?
- No.

18:26.174 --> 18:28.074
- Oh, my gosh.
- That's pretty amazing.

18:28.110 --> 18:31.177
Two people who like paper plates and
also have never had babies before.

18:31.213 --> 18:32.979
Is... Do you wanna...

18:33.015 --> 18:34.481
I don't know. I just...

18:34.516 --> 18:38.351
Do you want to go into the bathroom
with me and make babies together?

18:38.387 --> 18:40.520
(giggling)

18:40.589 --> 18:43.123
- Uh, yeah. I do.
- Really? Great.

18:43.158 --> 18:44.524
(laughing) Phil!

18:44.560 --> 18:46.326
- Hey, Mikey. What's up, man?
- Hey, you finally hit the dance floor.

18:46.361 --> 18:47.394
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hit it hard, yeah.

18:47.419 --> 18:48.461
It's about time. You did it.

18:48.497 --> 18:50.063
Dude, I am sorry about before.

18:50.098 --> 18:51.331
- I'll be real about it.
- No, it...

18:51.366 --> 18:52.316
It's fine, dude. Things got a

18:52.341 --> 18:53.266
little heated. It's crazy.

18:53.302 --> 18:53.987
It's funny you should

18:54.012 --> 18:54.834
come over here, 'cause..

18:54.870 --> 18:57.270
No, it's great you're talking
to Rebecca, my daughter.

18:57.306 --> 18:58.638
- Remember? Rebecca?
- Who's this?

18:58.674 --> 18:59.739
Remember the baby?

18:59.775 --> 19:01.041
The baby I had before.

19:01.076 --> 19:02.242
Remember she...

19:02.277 --> 19:03.777
Remember, I was holding the baby?

19:03.812 --> 19:04.878
Yoohoo? Phil?

19:04.913 --> 19:06.680
Yeah, no, okay, that's
your daughter Rebecca

19:06.715 --> 19:07.981
- She called you "Mommy."
- from earlier.

19:08.016 --> 19:09.349
Mm-hmm. I remember now. Yeah.

19:09.384 --> 19:10.384
So, what were you guys...

19:10.419 --> 19:11.484
- You guys are hanging out?
- Nothing.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.686
No, no, no.

19:12.721 --> 19:14.254
I just bumped into her. I
don't even know who she...

19:14.289 --> 19:15.989
We were gonna go make babies.

19:16.024 --> 19:18.475
Why... Why would you say that right now?

19:18.527 --> 19:21.394
♪ ♪

19:25.734 --> 19:28.535
(murmuring)

19:28.570 --> 19:29.786
Argh.

19:45.754 --> 19:47.637
Well, holy shit, this is incredible.

19:47.673 --> 19:48.888
This is so nice.

19:48.924 --> 19:51.007
Infinitely better than the motel bed.

19:51.059 --> 19:52.976
(laughing) Yeah, a little bit.

19:53.011 --> 19:54.761
I mean, look at the space here!

19:54.796 --> 19:57.230
And by the way, we're
living on the food.

19:57.265 --> 19:59.532
On the food! We don't
have to get food anymore.

19:59.568 --> 20:00.967
It's right here.

20:01.003 --> 20:03.269
Wait. Turn your head
for a second, please?

20:03.305 --> 20:04.804
- Turn it here?
- What?

20:04.840 --> 20:06.606
Is that an earring?

20:06.642 --> 20:10.443
Oh. Yeah, that's a...
Yeah, I got an earring.

20:10.479 --> 20:12.545
Okay. Um...

20:12.581 --> 20:13.947
So, let's get to work!

20:13.982 --> 20:16.616
I'm just curious what you were thinking.

20:16.652 --> 20:18.551
I'm expressing myself, that's all.

20:18.587 --> 20:19.753
Yeah, I just feel like, you know,

20:19.788 --> 20:21.988
that at our age, it's a little
strange to get an earring.

20:22.024 --> 20:23.323
Lots of people get them.

20:23.358 --> 20:25.025
Look, there was the
cologne phase for you,

20:25.060 --> 20:26.926
- and I didn't say anything.
- Ugh, listen...

20:26.962 --> 20:28.002
Then there was the Miatas.

20:28.030 --> 20:30.730
That is a great car.
That was about mileage.

20:30.766 --> 20:33.333
The earring is a little
awkward, it's a little strange,

20:33.368 --> 20:34.401
and I just wanna hear...

20:34.436 --> 20:36.536
Okay, I got it because I'm young!

20:38.507 --> 20:40.440
Because I'm young!

20:40.475 --> 20:43.243
Oh... Oh. Okay. Oh, boy.

20:43.278 --> 20:44.798
Here, let me... Let me... Let me, uh...

20:44.813 --> 20:46.112
Here, you just sit right here.

20:46.148 --> 20:47.514
You just sit down.

20:47.549 --> 20:49.749
(crying) I just like t he way it looks.

20:49.785 --> 20:51.384
- I like the way...
- Okay, listen.

20:51.420 --> 20:54.120
We haven't had a chance to
really talk since the divorce.

20:54.156 --> 20:56.022
Oh, it's... No.

20:56.058 --> 20:57.098
- No.
- And if you wanna...

20:57.125 --> 20:59.159
I just...

20:59.194 --> 21:01.194
I just get sad sometimes, still.

21:01.229 --> 21:02.190
Hey, hey, look, you know,

21:02.215 --> 21:03.496
- divorce is a tough thing.
- Yeah.

21:03.532 --> 21:05.298
- Yeah.
- And I just wanna tell you,

21:05.333 --> 21:07.667
I think you're handling it super well.

21:07.703 --> 21:08.902
You're making good choices.

21:08.937 --> 21:11.171
I mean, this earring right
here, right off the bat,

21:11.206 --> 21:13.339
I think it's pretty cool.

21:13.375 --> 21:14.974
I feel like you have a joke coming.

21:15.010 --> 21:17.811
Nothing about... did I buy
a bracelet to go with it,

21:17.846 --> 21:20.547
or, uh, "Does it go with a formal gown?"

21:20.582 --> 21:23.950
Or, what else? "Good thing my
daddy's dead or he'd be so mad."

21:23.985 --> 21:25.885
I heard those earlier today. Someone...

21:25.921 --> 21:29.255
They also said I looked
like, um, a Mexican baby.

21:29.291 --> 21:30.503
That culture tends to pierce the

21:30.528 --> 21:31.791
- ears a lot younger.
- Right away.

21:31.827 --> 21:34.394
There, I'll admit, that looks nuts.

21:34.429 --> 21:35.862
Nothing like that? It's over.

21:35.897 --> 21:37.197
- We're done.
- Okay.

21:37.232 --> 21:39.399
Why don't we table this
discussion and have a little lunch?

21:39.434 --> 21:40.900
Yeah, yeah.

21:40.936 --> 21:42.936

21:42.971 --> 21:44.370

21:47.576 --> 21:49.609
There's a sweet and
salty thing happening?

21:49.644 --> 21:51.111
It's like, Asiany...

21:51.146 --> 21:52.426
It's like... It's a Hep B. Hep B.

21:52.447 --> 21:54.180
God, I haven't tasted that in so long.

21:54.216 --> 21:55.949
- Since South America.
- Yeah.

21:55.984 --> 21:59.135
Mm-mmm!

22:01.973 --> 22:03.223
Are you kidding me?

22:03.225 --> 22:04.941
What? He is a great guy, Dad.

22:04.976 --> 22:05.976
I'm pretty good.

22:06.027 --> 22:07.944
He's my best friend! Well, not anymore.

22:07.979 --> 22:09.195
Ow!

22:09.231 --> 22:10.897
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

22:10.899 --> 22:12.782
It's just, like, I got a
little stomachache or something.

22:12.818 --> 22:15.118
This is what I want
to do, Dad. Accept me.

22:15.153 --> 22:17.466
Yeah, well, I didn't know that included

22:17.491 --> 22:19.513
being a hooch that goes around...

22:19.541 --> 22:20.540
- A hooch!
- She's not a hooch, Mike.

22:20.575 --> 22:21.958
- selling her stuff!
- She's not a hooch, Mike!

22:21.993 --> 22:23.042
It's true!

22:23.078 --> 22:24.794

don't have to scream that.

22:28.834 --> 22:30.333

22:30.385 --> 22:32.218
Fink, I'm clearly in
the middle of something.

22:32.254 --> 22:33.920

It's not good, man!

22:41.313 --> 22:42.479
These pills are not good!

22:42.514 --> 22:43.596
- It... Urgh.
- What?

22:43.648 --> 22:46.099

Oh, yeah. No, he gave
me one of those, it's
