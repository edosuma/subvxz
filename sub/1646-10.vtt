00:01.167 --> 00:02.711
Previously on Prison Break:

00:03.169 --> 00:05.171
If you're successful
with obtaining Scylla,

00:05.255 --> 00:08.049
you'll not only avoid jail time,
but you could take great pride

00:08.383 --> 00:10.927
in knowing you helped dismantle
this country's greatest threat

00:11.011 --> 00:12.220
to its own democracy.

00:12.554 --> 00:14.097
If you're killed
while doing so,

00:14.180 --> 00:16.057
a proper funeral
will be provided.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.308
Gretchen has the rest
of the pages.

00:17.392 --> 00:19.602
We can't go any further
until she gives them back.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.688
Why are we doing this again?

00:21.771 --> 00:23.565
It's an insurance policy.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.275
You put a gun on me again,

00:25.358 --> 00:27.861
and these aren't the only set
of prints I'll be copying.

00:30.905 --> 00:31.990
Mike!

00:32.699 --> 00:35.702
Michael, what's wrong?
Talk to me! Michael?

00:35.785 --> 00:39.080
I want Scylla out of Los Angeles
by the end of the day

00:39.456 --> 00:40.582
tomorrow.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.502
Brad, get out of there!

00:44.586 --> 00:45.587
Push it!

00:45.670 --> 00:47.088
Don't do this!

00:47.172 --> 00:48.965
Brad!

01:03.146 --> 01:04.314
If anything should happen,

01:04.397 --> 01:05.940
call my mom in Chicago.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.942
Nothing's going to happen.

01:10.528 --> 01:11.780
So where's Brad's body now?

01:12.030 --> 01:13.364
We have it on its way to the morgue,

01:13.448 --> 01:16.117
and it's at the cooler at Homeland
Security where nobody can find it.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.577
That ain't part
of the deal.

01:17.660 --> 01:18.703
You said if anything
happened to us,

01:18.787 --> 01:20.163
that we'd be returned
to the next of kin.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.581
No. That's not
exactly what I said.

01:21.664 --> 01:22.624
No, that is exactly
what you said.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.709
No, it isn't exactly
what I said, okay?

01:24.793 --> 01:27.420
And he needs to stay a John Doe
until I say otherwise.

01:27.796 --> 01:28.880
Okay? I'm dealing

01:28.963 --> 01:30.965
with enough stuff already, and
I've had my ass chewed out...

01:35.804 --> 01:37.055
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:42.644 --> 01:43.603
He's got...

01:44.062 --> 01:45.730
He's got a mother, you know.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.942
If you want Scylla,
and I assume you still do,

01:49.150 --> 01:51.402
Brad Bellick's body goes home
to his mother.

01:56.658 --> 01:57.909
All right, all right.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.789
All right, I'm gonna
take care of the body.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.457
But you guys

02:04.541 --> 02:06.209
need to get out of mourning.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.502
Okay, we need
to get back to work.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.504
You need
to pack Brad's stuff up,

02:09.587 --> 02:11.589
and we need to
get back to work.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.007
And Fernando,

02:13.091 --> 02:15.802
my friend,
let me tell you something.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.679
If you ever put your hands
on me again,

02:17.762 --> 02:19.180
I promise you, okay,

02:19.264 --> 02:21.099
there's gonna be
two bodies in the fridge.

02:22.016 --> 02:22.976
But I need results.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.478
Yeah, well, I need
to see those missing pages.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.771
So, what's it gonna be?

02:38.658 --> 02:39.868
I heard you were dead.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.202
Who told you that?

02:44.747 --> 02:46.040
A little bird.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.003
That's awfully
generous of you.

02:50.086 --> 02:51.546
It's all a matter
of timing.

02:51.629 --> 02:54.757
The Company is moving Scylla
to a bunker in Pennsylvania.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.217
When?
Tomorrow.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.345
You want to make sure to mention that
on the phone right away, as soon as...?

02:59.596 --> 03:00.722
You know, for
an ex-employee,

03:00.805 --> 03:02.432
you sure seem to know
an awful lot about current

03:02.515 --> 03:03.600
Company business.

03:03.683 --> 03:04.726
Don't get paranoid.

03:05.101 --> 03:07.020
I'm keeping one ear
to the ground for your benefit,

03:07.103 --> 03:10.231
which is a really good reason to
work with me and not against me.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.025
All right, you know what?
We got our pages.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.067
Let's go.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.831
That's Enzen from transpo.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.500
He's responsible
for the power transfer.

03:29.584 --> 03:30.877
And you know Powell.

03:31.544 --> 03:32.670
He's supervising

03:32.754 --> 03:33.922
the security override.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.506
It's a big job.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.176
Perhaps we should call in
David Baker.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.136
Just to be safe.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.305
That won't be
necessary.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.809
We can do this
all in-house.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.394
And Scylla will be gone
by morning.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.322
I promised Brad I would call
his mom if anything happened.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.449
I'll do it
if you want.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.078
No, it's okay. I'll do it.

04:06.537 --> 04:07.914
Look at this.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.209
He kept a badge
from the police benefit.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.836
When he was
a CO in Fox River,

04:13.920 --> 04:16.422
he-he failed the test
to get into the academy

04:16.506 --> 04:17.715
five times.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.685
These are right, right?

04:28.768 --> 04:30.895
This is a map of the
Company's basement, right?

04:32.480 --> 04:33.940
I don't know.
It looks too simple.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.943
I assumed it would be a lot
more complicated than this.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.654
These symbols, they're...

04:39.737 --> 04:42.282
They don't make any sense,
and the letters, uh...

04:43.283 --> 04:44.826
There's just something wrong.

04:45.618 --> 04:46.703
This letter C,

04:46.786 --> 04:48.788
it usually designates
some kind of heating vent.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.874
The M designates a meter.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.210
This is some sort
of condensing unit.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.546
This is a plumbing part.
It's called a P-trap.

04:56.629 --> 04:59.841
They're all completely
dissimilar items.

04:59.924 --> 05:01.467
Logical design dictates
they'd never

05:01.551 --> 05:02.885
be installed
that randomly.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.554
It just, um...

05:04.637 --> 05:05.888
It doesn't make sense.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.933
"C," "M," "E."

05:10.018 --> 05:10.893
"C,"

05:10.977 --> 05:12.770
"M," "E."

05:12.854 --> 05:14.230
C, M, E.

05:18.067 --> 05:21.904
C... M... E.

05:22.739 --> 05:23.865
That's "See me."

05:23.948 --> 05:24.991
These letters don't
make any sense

05:25.074 --> 05:26.200
if you think of
them as symbols,

05:26.284 --> 05:29.537
but they do if you think
of them literally.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.122
"Do you see me?" He's asking

05:31.205 --> 05:32.290
if you see him.

05:32.373 --> 05:33.333
Where?

05:33.416 --> 05:34.625
Here.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.893
David Baker?

05:51.976 --> 05:54.228
Yeah, but who besides you two,
would come up

05:54.312 --> 05:55.605
with something
like that?

05:55.688 --> 05:57.023
I mean, what's the point?

05:58.566 --> 05:59.776
I don't know,

05:59.859 --> 06:01.986
but we're never going
to figure this blueprint out

06:02.070 --> 06:03.780
if we can't find the person
who drew it.

06:06.616 --> 06:07.909
We need David Baker.

06:52.662 --> 06:53.913
Hello, darling.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.039
Good morning.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.375
Here is your coffee.
One sugar, two creams.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.253
And those fingerprints
you ordered.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.171
Gretchen's?

07:02.255 --> 07:05.091
Yes. Gretchen
Louise Morgan.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.094
How did you pull off a thing
like that?

07:08.177 --> 07:10.179
I have a friend
who works with the CHiPs.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.849
But don't get too excited.
There's not much there.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.519
Gretchen Louise Morgan.

07:16.602 --> 07:20.314
3-29-77,
Johnstown, West Virginia.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.066
Her sister lives
in Riverside.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.734
Daddy deceased.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.861
Hmm.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.196
Award-winning
equestrian.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.406
Iraqi war vet.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.533
I'll be damned.
Clean-cut chick.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.118
At least on paper.

07:32.785 --> 07:33.995
But I don't see any evidence

07:34.078 --> 07:36.080
that she's related
to Chinese organized crime.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.207
No husband in Beijing?

07:38.291 --> 07:39.876
No prior arrest
for extortion?

07:39.959 --> 07:41.043
Nope.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.503
No mention of
any of our friends?

07:42.587 --> 07:43.546
Hmm. I checked.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.090
No Scofield, no Burrows,
no Whistler.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.676
Whistler?

07:50.970 --> 07:52.513
How do you know
that name?

07:52.597 --> 07:53.806
James Whistler?

07:53.890 --> 07:55.433
I heard Scofield
mention him one day.

07:55.516 --> 07:57.226
What day?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.269
The day that I met him.

07:58.978 --> 07:59.979
In what context?

08:00.563 --> 08:02.899
I-I don't remember.

08:03.649 --> 08:04.901
Why? What's the big deal?

08:04.984 --> 08:05.860
Who is he?

08:07.820 --> 08:09.238
Nobody.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.242
That will be all for now.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.879
Here's another one.
David Allen Baker.

08:24.962 --> 08:27.048
He's an advisor to the
city planning commission.

08:27.131 --> 08:30.510
Won an award for designing
low-income housing.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.220
Wife is named Elaine, and there's

08:32.303 --> 08:33.638
the address.

08:34.263 --> 08:35.848
I'll print a map.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.268
All right, we still

08:39.352 --> 08:40.269
need that sixth card,
all right?

08:40.353 --> 08:41.604
Really?

08:42.188 --> 08:43.105
All right.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.650
We've got at least
thirty more yards to go

08:45.733 --> 08:48.152
past the water main before we get to the
Company building.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.112
Michael, Michael, see that?

08:50.196 --> 08:51.197
That looks like it could be

08:51.280 --> 08:52.448
some sort of obstruction
in the tunnel.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.783
Whatever it is,
whatever it takes,

08:53.866 --> 08:55.743
we got to get through that
in the next few hours.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.287
I want you guys to go down there
and get started.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.499
Sara and I will go and look for,
uh... for David Baker.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.459
And Bellick gets back
to his mom.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.337
Yeah, and when we get Scylla,

09:06.420 --> 09:08.130
we're walking away
from this crap.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.549
Absolutely.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.592
Sara...

09:18.724 --> 09:20.560
Michael?

09:21.060 --> 09:22.144
Mike!

09:31.654 --> 09:32.989
I'm okay.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.615
You get him to the car.

09:34.699 --> 09:35.783
Where you gonna take him?

09:35.866 --> 09:36.993
Hospital.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.869
Come on, guys, let's not freak out, all right?
Calm down.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.997
This is my decision, and not yours,
and we're going to the hospital.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.331
Well, what's
wrong with him?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.624
David Baker.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.126
I'll go. I'll find him.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.254
Listen, don't forget

09:48.337 --> 09:49.380
to use your fake ID
at the hospital.

09:49.463 --> 09:50.923
Shut the door.
Okay.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.024
Mr. White?

10:08.733 --> 10:10.484
If you'd allow me to be nosy,

10:10.568 --> 10:13.279
how long has Trishanne been
part of the organization?

10:13.529 --> 10:14.864
Temp agency sent her over

10:14.947 --> 10:16.198
about a week
before you got here.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.618
If you don't mind,
I'd like to take a look

10:18.701 --> 10:20.661
at her application.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.580
I always make a point
of checking out the background

10:22.663 --> 10:25.041
of anyone who deals
with my personal affairs.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.167
I understand.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.210
I'll talk to HR.
Thank you.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.211
Hey, uh, Cole,
you know what?

10:29.295 --> 10:31.422
Um, today around noon,

10:31.505 --> 10:33.424
I really need you

10:33.507 --> 10:35.009
to step in for
Andrew Blauner.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.427
Host an intro.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.387
New franchises
from Idaho.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.306
We got to knock 'em out.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.976
I'd like to see some
of that Cole Pfeiffer magic.

10:47.021 --> 10:47.938
Abracadabra.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.659
Excuse me, sir?

11:00.034 --> 11:01.118
Are you a salesman?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.328
Yes, indeedy I am.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.788
What can I do for you?

11:08.167 --> 11:09.585
Well, I can see
that you're busy,

11:09.669 --> 11:11.671
but I didn't want you
to be the last to know.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.006
Scylla is moving.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.175
Come back?

11:16.258 --> 11:18.344
Don't worry. We're gonna
stick to our original plan.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.180
What exactly is the plan?

11:21.263 --> 11:22.264
We wait.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.349
-Wait?
-Yes.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.602
Okay, have you ever heard
of noodling?

11:26.686 --> 11:27.978
I don't believe so.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.022
Well, then, what kind of
hillbilly are you, really?

11:30.815 --> 11:32.024
I'll explain
it to you.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.693
Noodling...

11:33.776 --> 11:35.611
is when
a foolhardy bastard swims

11:35.695 --> 11:37.154
to the bottom
of a muddy riverbed

11:37.238 --> 11:39.949
and he sticks his hand down
into the deepest,

11:40.032 --> 11:41.033
darkest hole.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.868
He's looking for
a prize catfish.

11:42.952 --> 11:46.330
Now, sometimes
the catfish does live there,

11:46.414 --> 11:47.623
and the noodler pulls it out

11:47.707 --> 11:50.042
with his bare hand
and he drags it ashore,

11:50.126 --> 11:51.711
but sometimes,
he reaches in that hole

11:51.794 --> 11:53.129
and he finds a snapping turtle.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.297
Bites his hand clean off.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.677
Scofield's a noodler.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.388
Yes, and if he reaches

12:02.555 --> 12:04.014
into the Company hole
and he finds Scylla,

12:04.098 --> 12:06.350
we take it and we
sell it to Feng.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.103
If he gets a
turtle, well...

12:09.979 --> 12:11.397
Not our hand.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.109
The contractors are here.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.113
What the hell
are you doing here?

12:19.196 --> 12:20.156
I'm a client.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.115
You're a client, huh?

12:21.198 --> 12:22.032
Just keep it down.
Keep it down.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.325
It's all part of the ruse.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.618
We need some help.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.579
I'm already providing
my services,

12:26.787 --> 12:28.289
white-collar style,
all right?

12:28.372 --> 12:29.832
Where's, where's Pretty
and the Fatman?

12:29.915 --> 12:31.584
Bellick's dead.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.044
If you joke about it,
I'll rip your tongue out.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.381
Let's go, Linc.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.430
Sorry to bother you,

12:44.513 --> 12:46.474
but I'm an internist
and I brought my husband in.

12:46.557 --> 12:47.641
He's in and out
of consciousness

12:47.725 --> 12:49.351
and he's got some symptoms
that concern me.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.772
I'd be really grateful if
we could see a neurologist.

12:52.855 --> 12:53.814
Does he have insurance?

12:53.898 --> 12:55.566
Uh, yeah.

12:55.649 --> 12:56.650
I don't have the card,

12:56.734 --> 12:57.735
but, um,

12:57.818 --> 12:58.819
I have his I.D.

12:58.903 --> 12:59.904
Here. Just fill this out.

12:59.987 --> 13:00.988
Okay, thank you.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.533
Mr. Freling?

13:05.743 --> 13:07.453
Mr. Freling.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.538
Yes, that's... that's me.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.207
Is it always low?

13:13.918 --> 13:14.919
A little.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.171
Has anyone in your
family ever suffered

13:17.254 --> 13:20.716
from epilepsy, stroke, TIAs,
any neurological disorder?

13:22.593 --> 13:23.511
My mom.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.598
Okay.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.725
Jimmy, take this gentleman
back to bay four.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.857
Why are we relocating?

13:36.982 --> 13:38.734
The Scylla's security
is the foundation

13:38.859 --> 13:40.027
of this entire organization.

13:40.402 --> 13:41.529
I realize that,

13:41.612 --> 13:43.989
but have you thought
about the ramifications?

13:44.073 --> 13:45.699
If we lose
critical access,

13:45.783 --> 13:48.828
it could compromise our
timeline on stage two.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.667
The plates
and the facility are ready

13:54.750 --> 13:57.086
to print as much currency
as we need

13:57.169 --> 13:58.128
at any time.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.007
When will Scylla be installed
in Pennsylvania?

14:02.091 --> 14:03.884
Lisa, what's our timeline?

14:05.678 --> 14:07.972
Actually, there's been
a bit of a problem.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.015
Dismantling the security

14:10.099 --> 14:12.017
surrounding Scylla
is a bit tricky.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.352
It may take longer
than we thought.

14:13.435 --> 14:14.728
How much longer?

14:16.021 --> 14:18.107
I can make this happen
right now.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.152
Yes, General.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.029
Go get David Baker.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.322
Yes, sir.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.123
Yes?

14:34.206 --> 14:38.544
Uh, hello, I'm, uh,
I'm looking for a Mr. David Baker.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.963
He's not taking any new projects
right now.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.717
Actually, I had some...
some questions about something

14:44.800 --> 14:46.719
that he worked on
a few years ago.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.471
Are you familiar with a project
called Scylla?

14:59.106 --> 15:00.774
I'm working!

15:02.192 --> 15:05.571
This man would like
to talk to you about Scylla.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.408
Your Company?

15:10.659 --> 15:11.785
Yes, sir.

15:11.869 --> 15:15.497
I'm in logistics, and I'd
like to ask you some questions

15:15.581 --> 15:17.082
about your original design.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.046
It's been a long time
since I thought about that.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.632
Be lucky to
remember anything.

15:25.507 --> 15:26.508
Looks like you're
pretty busy.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.385
Do you mind if
I take a look?

15:43.442 --> 15:45.027
You know, Bellick
saved my life.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.403
What?

15:52.242 --> 15:55.037
Back when we were
in prison in Panama.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.041
T-Bag went crazy,
he, he went nuts.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.418
What happened?

16:01.502 --> 16:04.713
He lit Sona on fire,
told everyone to run.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.508
They can't shoot us all,
he said.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.970
It was a stampede, bro, I...

16:11.053 --> 16:12.304
I was down
getting trampled.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.681
I, I couldn't get up,

16:13.764 --> 16:15.891
I couldn't breathe, I thought
I was going to die and...

16:16.892 --> 16:19.895
But then something pulled me
back to my feet.

16:21.855 --> 16:22.856
It was Bellick.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.363
He saved my life.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.527
That wall's got
to come down?

17:09.403 --> 17:11.363
Unless you got
a better idea.

17:11.822 --> 17:12.990
Okay.

17:22.332 --> 17:24.293
What was that?

17:24.376 --> 17:26.378
I don't know.
I think I stepped on something.

17:35.888 --> 17:36.972
What's going on, Linc?

17:38.974 --> 17:40.517
I don't know, man.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.360
It's some kind of explosive.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.613
Explosive?
Then shouldn't I be dead?

17:55.491 --> 17:57.493
If you move, you will be.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.172
They're underground.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.757
You're not going
to be able to reach them.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.011
Right.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.430
You know what?

18:18.514 --> 18:19.681
They'll be fine
without you.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.227
Right.

18:23.310 --> 18:25.229
You ever heard of Fox River?

18:25.312 --> 18:27.731
Maybe we could talk
about it over dinner.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.983
I got a gift card
to the Red Lobster

18:30.067 --> 18:31.568
over off the interstate.

18:33.195 --> 18:36.615
I never thought the guys would
be so sad for Brad Bellick.

18:36.698 --> 18:39.368
A lot of things have
changed since Fox River.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.373
-You know you can't control this.
-Yeah?

18:45.916 --> 18:48.627
It's funny, I was just about
to tell you the same thing.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.298
Whatever it is,
we can manage it.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.925
We just need to know
what we're dealing with.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.554
What if I don't
want to know?

19:03.308 --> 19:05.269
Kevin Freling?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.544
Should only take
a few minutes.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.171
You ready?

19:32.254 --> 19:33.589
I'm ready.

19:47.728 --> 19:51.607
My goal is to build one city
that entirely self-sustains,

19:51.690 --> 19:54.318
depending
on no outside resources.

19:54.401 --> 19:57.362
A community living
entirely in harmony.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.073
How close is it
to becoming a reality?

20:00.157 --> 20:01.742
Well, that's a matter
of opinion.

20:02.492 --> 20:03.535
People look at something

20:03.619 --> 20:04.995
like this and they think
it's impossible.

20:06.496 --> 20:09.958
In reality, I could
make it happen tomorrow.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.376
Like what they
built in Dubai.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.795
Exactly! Grand ideas

20:13.879 --> 20:15.005
brought into reality.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.635
This won't
just serve the rich.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.102
How long have you
been working for them?

20:33.732 --> 20:34.650
Too long.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.818
I came in in '94.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.115
I was never good
at collecting a paycheck.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.742
Always freelance.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.411
Partially retired
all the time.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.749
I like to finish a job
and then move on.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.085
Put it in the past.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.838
Do you always leave
your name behind,

20:57.547 --> 20:59.174
instead of the correct
specifications?

21:01.009 --> 21:02.386
Only on the Scylla project.

21:03.387 --> 21:06.265
Well, we're considering
modifications and...

21:06.348 --> 21:08.809
I was hoping
that you...

21:08.892 --> 21:09.768
could help me figure out

21:09.851 --> 21:12.312
what should really appear
on those blueprints.

21:12.396 --> 21:15.524
As of right now,
they don't mean much.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.527
Didn't you read the legend?

21:18.902 --> 21:19.778
Sure.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.031
But we still had
a lot of trouble.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.496
You're not Company.

21:34.084 --> 21:36.586
What should I do?

21:36.712 --> 21:38.088
Stay calm.
Calm?! You just said

21:38.171 --> 21:39.298
I'm standing on a bomb!

21:39.381 --> 21:40.799
We'll work it out.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.887
You think Gretchen set us up?

21:57.691 --> 21:59.067
"The lessons

21:59.151 --> 22:01.028
taught by our founder,
Mister..."

22:02.738 --> 22:03.739
"Harvey Hall."

22:05.574 --> 22:08.660
"The pathway
to personal freedom."

22:09.161 --> 22:10.829
Do people actually buy
this nonsense?

22:16.251 --> 22:17.252
Let go of me.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.004
You're coming with me
or through that glass.

22:19.087 --> 22:20.255
Choose.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.758
This is a place of business.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.561
GATE allows us
to find the pathway

22:34.686 --> 22:36.313
to personal freedom.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.816
Define our boundaries.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.736
See past them.

22:42.819 --> 22:45.530
Let me tell you a story
about the founder

22:45.614 --> 22:47.032
of this great program.

22:54.664 --> 22:57.709
You know, I'm gonna tell you
a better story

22:57.793 --> 23:01.296
about captivity
than the regular old spiel.

23:02.297 --> 23:03.465
Years back,

23:03.548 --> 23:07.219
I was providing
volunteer leadership

23:07.302 --> 23:08.595
in a local penitentiary.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.516
I worked with the head guard,

23:12.599 --> 23:15.560
a big, burly, bowlegged brat.

23:15.644 --> 23:16.978
Mean as the devil.

23:17.145 --> 23:20.190
All the prisoners were afraid
of him, even the murderers.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.402
And one day, Brad said to me,

23:23.485 --> 23:25.529
"Cole, I want you to get
out of here.

23:25.612 --> 23:27.072
"I want you to get
out of here right now,

23:27.155 --> 23:29.366
'cause I can tell you're
a man who loves freedom."

23:29.449 --> 23:31.785
And I said,
"Well, what about you, Brad?

23:32.953 --> 23:33.995
What about you?"

23:34.246 --> 23:35.914
He said, "Oh, yeah,
I'm... I'm...

23:35.997 --> 23:38.959
I'm gonna be free someday
when I retire."

23:41.294 --> 23:45.424
I recently got the news
that he had passed away.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.260
And where was he?

23:49.678 --> 23:52.389
Still in that prison.

23:52.472 --> 23:55.892
Still in the captivity
of negativity.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.404
Sorry, folks.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.408
Nah...

24:15.579 --> 24:16.872
Old Brad.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.127
Tsk.

24:25.672 --> 24:27.924
As my papa used to say,

24:29.342 --> 24:31.845
"Stand by, your glasses steady

24:32.137 --> 24:35.724
"and drink
to your comrade's eyes.

24:35.807 --> 24:39.227
"Here's a toast
to the dead already,

24:39.311 --> 24:42.522
and hurrah
for the next to die."

24:45.817 --> 24:46.860
I needed to make sure

24:46.943 --> 24:48.528
that I would have access
to your test results,

24:48.612 --> 24:50.030
so I told
the triage nurse

24:50.780 --> 24:52.157
that I was your wife.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.370
Has a nice ring.

24:58.872 --> 25:01.249
Are you Kevin Freling?

25:02.584 --> 25:04.002
Yes, I am.

25:04.085 --> 25:05.086
I'm Dr. Malden.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.254
I'm a neurologist.
And you're...

25:06.338 --> 25:09.299
Cameron Eberline.
I'm a... an internist.

25:09.382 --> 25:10.383
Do you have the results?

25:10.467 --> 25:11.635
It's gonna take
a little while.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.178
Uh, looking
at the family history,

25:13.261 --> 25:14.846
I'd like to admit you here.

25:14.930 --> 25:16.431
We're working
on a room.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.641
Just for now,

25:17.724 --> 25:18.934
till we get
the test results back.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.268
I don't think that'll be
necessary, but thank you.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.228
It would be best
if you could rest

25:21.311 --> 25:22.979
where you could be monitored.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.189
After that, we'll determine

25:24.272 --> 25:26.107
what the best course
of action is.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.192
Agreed?

25:27.275 --> 25:28.610
I think we have to go.
I'm sorry.

25:28.693 --> 25:31.530
Hold on, hold on. how long...
how long will it take to get the results?

25:31.613 --> 25:34.491
Couple of hours.
But we'll get you in a room before then.

25:34.574 --> 25:36.493
Just wait here.
Thank you.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.162
Come on.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.047
You know what happens?

25:49.130 --> 25:50.507
They take over
your life.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.050
You don't own it
any more.

25:52.133 --> 25:53.802
That is not what
happened to me.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.680
Th-Th-Then somehow you
stayed out of trouble.

25:56.763 --> 25:58.557
You did what they
told you to do.

26:00.433 --> 26:02.769
Maybe that's why you
stuck around, huh?

26:02.852 --> 26:04.104
Right here in
Los Angeles.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.815
In my case, they had
something on me,

26:06.898 --> 26:08.900
and they used it and
they never let me go.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.820
They've killed hundreds,
thousands of people

26:11.903 --> 26:13.989
in the pursuit of power,
you know that.

26:14.072 --> 26:16.658
We lost a good man yesterday
trying to stop them.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.577
They hurt a lot
of people, David.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.078
David.

26:20.870 --> 26:21.997
Look...

26:22.080 --> 26:24.666
I stay out of the politics.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.042
It was a job.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.587
I specialized
in security engineering.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.089
The Scylla project was a choice
assignment, so I took it.

26:31.172 --> 26:33.174
They told you what
it was, didn't they?

26:33.258 --> 26:35.010
They told you what
it was, and now

26:35.093 --> 26:37.012
you wish that you never
helped them, but you're trapped.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.305
You're trapped
like I was.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.556
You talk like
it's all in the present.

26:39.806 --> 26:40.974
It is!

26:50.775 --> 26:52.861
I know you want to move on.

26:52.944 --> 26:53.903
Look at what you're doing.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.363
Are you trying
to make up for something?

26:55.447 --> 26:57.616
Forget the charitable
city of the future,

26:57.699 --> 27:00.243
and worry about the world that
you live in right now, David.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.370
What they did...
what they're doing...

27:02.454 --> 27:03.913
is not my fault.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.672
You put your name
in there for a reason.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.132
You wanted someone
to find you,

27:14.215 --> 27:16.676
and if you tell me
what I need to know,

27:16.760 --> 27:18.386
I can do something
for both of us.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.058
Where is your husband?

27:23.141 --> 27:25.226
He went to run some errands.
He should be right back.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.479
That's his car
in the driveway, isn't it?

27:29.147 --> 27:31.524
Just a moment. I'll go
call him on his cell.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.152
-Excuse me!
-Backup requested, southeast door.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.287
You knew about this,
didn't you?

27:44.371 --> 27:47.457
First of all, I have no idea

27:47.540 --> 27:48.625
why the Company would want

27:48.708 --> 27:49.751
to put an
explosive device

27:49.834 --> 27:51.586
of any kind under
their own building.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.921
We're under the courtyard.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.006
And you know what,
I honestly had no idea

27:55.090 --> 27:57.133
that any of this
was even here.

28:00.887 --> 28:03.014
That being said...

28:04.683 --> 28:08.478
These look a lot like JZ33
anti-personnel blast mines.

28:09.562 --> 28:10.772
Back in Fallujah,

28:10.855 --> 28:14.150
the Muj used to bury them
outside their firm base.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.443
Get rid of them.

28:16.945 --> 28:19.114
Well, I'm no expert,
but I have an idea.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.408
What's beeping?

28:21.741 --> 28:22.867
It beeps!

28:24.452 --> 28:27.038
Wow, you must've
stepped on this just right.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.790
Your weight
is evenly distributed

28:28.873 --> 28:30.041
across the pressure plate,

28:30.125 --> 28:31.960
and you haven't engaged
the firing pin.

28:32.043 --> 28:33.628
You can't move an inch.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.713
We know.

28:34.796 --> 28:35.964
What's your idea?

28:36.047 --> 28:37.966
Well, my idea
is that he moves an inch.

28:38.049 --> 28:39.217
That way, I can get to the hole,

28:39.300 --> 28:40.635
and I can dismantle
the firing pin.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.637
Right now, he's standing on it,
and I can't do anything.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.515
No, no, no, Linc,

28:45.598 --> 28:46.641
What?

28:46.725 --> 28:48.476
Call your brother, please.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.478
You-- you stay here.

28:50.562 --> 28:51.604
Fine.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.316
It's my brother.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.317
Michael...

28:57.527 --> 28:58.528
Let's go.

29:01.906 --> 29:03.450
Sara...

29:03.533 --> 29:05.326
You're not leaving, are you?

29:05.410 --> 29:07.537
You have our number.
And who are you again?

29:07.620 --> 29:09.414
He prefers to wait at home.
I'm monitoring him.

29:09.497 --> 29:12.834
He's leaving AMA
in a potentially fragile condition.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.419
Look, I'm not stupid.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.713
I know who you are,

29:16.796 --> 29:17.881
and I'm not gonna
turn you in.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.674
My concern is for
what's going on

29:19.758 --> 29:21.801
with your health.

29:21.885 --> 29:22.969
They aren't here for you,

29:23.052 --> 29:24.345
and I'm telling you,
in your condition...

29:24.429 --> 29:26.556
Thank you, Doctor.
I appreciate your help.

29:27.515 --> 29:29.225
Please do call us.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.192
Can I help you?

29:43.448 --> 29:44.908
Uh...

29:47.952 --> 29:49.454
I messed up.

29:49.537 --> 29:50.872
What do you mean?

29:50.955 --> 29:52.957
Today, I was working
with Bagwell.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.876
He's been
compliant as hell.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.711
I thought that I
would make him happy.

29:56.795 --> 29:57.879
He wanted to talk
about Gretchen Morgan.

29:57.962 --> 29:58.880
Right, and what happened?

29:58.963 --> 30:00.882
And I slipped up.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.091
I mentioned Whistler.

30:02.175 --> 30:04.719
This one is tough,
I'm telling you.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.096
Bagwell, Gretchen Morgan -
they're thugs.

30:07.180 --> 30:09.599
I have been face down
with a gun

30:09.682 --> 30:11.976
to the back of my head
more than once.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.145
Oh, my...

30:17.190 --> 30:18.817
All right.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.819
Look, I don't want
you to do something

30:20.902 --> 30:22.237
that you don't
want to do.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.405
You're a good agent.
we could reassign...

30:24.489 --> 30:26.533
No, no, that is not it.

30:26.616 --> 30:27.909
Look, I can
handle this.

30:27.992 --> 30:28.868
I'm just...

30:28.952 --> 30:30.995
I'm just kicking myself.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.123
I could find something else
for you to do, okay?

30:34.207 --> 30:36.084
This thing has gotten
way out of hand.

30:36.167 --> 30:38.628
Dallow is on my back, and the
Company is moving Scylla...

30:38.711 --> 30:39.712
No.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.006
I'm fine.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.051
Are you sure?

30:46.845 --> 30:49.597
I really think
we can do this, Don.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.432
We can bring the Company down.

30:54.519 --> 30:57.605
Ego is the only reason I coded
my name into those blueprints.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.983
I don't feel guilty about anything.

31:00.066 --> 31:01.609
I gotta take this.
I'm sorry.

31:01.693 --> 31:02.777
Hello?

31:02.861 --> 31:04.737
Alex, we got a problem.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.155
What?

31:06.239 --> 31:08.658
We got a problem.
There's a damn minefield down there.

31:08.741 --> 31:10.076
Hello, I can't hear you.

31:10.159 --> 31:11.452
Sucre's in trouble.

31:11.536 --> 31:12.871
He's standing on a mine.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.122
We need to deactivate it.

31:19.127 --> 31:21.045
Linc, I gotta go.
I'll call you back.

31:21.379 --> 31:22.463
Wh...

31:23.047 --> 31:24.465
They're here, David.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.843
What do they want from me?

31:26.926 --> 31:27.927
They're moving Scylla,

31:28.011 --> 31:29.304
protecting it!
Everything you did for them,

31:29.387 --> 31:31.806
they want you
to do it again.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.349
You think you can stop them?

31:33.433 --> 31:34.851
I know all about you.

31:34.934 --> 31:36.769
I've known about you
for six months.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.062
Ever since somebody
stole those plans

31:38.146 --> 31:39.522
from the Company.

31:39.606 --> 31:40.773
It will never work.

31:40.857 --> 31:41.983
You won't get past
the first wall.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.359
What about the first wall?

31:43.443 --> 31:45.612
What's gonna stop me, huh?
The minefield?

31:50.742 --> 31:53.161
Please... don't tell 'em.

32:06.257 --> 32:08.259
We've got him.
Sweep the area.

32:38.247 --> 32:40.083
There's a dirt road at
the bottom of the hill.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.042
It will take you out.

32:41.709 --> 32:42.710
Your husband...
Just go.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.879
He won't help you. That will!

32:51.719 --> 32:54.430
Lincoln, go call him again.

32:54.681 --> 32:56.015
Linc, go call him.

32:56.474 --> 32:57.350
Linc, go call him!

32:57.433 --> 32:58.726
What will Michael know
about this?

32:59.060 --> 33:01.646
I mean, it's not exactly
within his realm of expertise.

33:01.729 --> 33:02.814
We're wasting time.

33:02.897 --> 33:04.774
I gave you a semiprofessional
assessment.

33:04.857 --> 33:06.025
What's wrong?

33:06.109 --> 33:07.610
You don't trust me, Fernando?

33:09.362 --> 33:10.613
Why should he?

33:10.780 --> 33:13.199
Because we all want
the same thing: Scylla.

33:13.282 --> 33:14.575
And I'm not gonna
let a giant pack

33:14.659 --> 33:16.369
of firecrackers
stand in our way.

33:16.452 --> 33:17.745
Or would you like me to call

33:17.829 --> 33:18.913
the bomb squad?

33:20.540 --> 33:23.376
Look, I am offering to do you
a massive favor here.

33:23.459 --> 33:25.294
If that thing blows
while I'm pulling the pin,

33:25.378 --> 33:27.880
he loses a leg.
I lose a face!

33:33.094 --> 33:35.596
Now, don't worry,
Fernando.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.724
I'm known
for my steady hand.

33:42.103 --> 33:43.646
Take a deep breath, okay?

33:44.522 --> 33:46.482
Keep your weight even.

33:46.566 --> 33:49.402
And I need you
to shift, slowly,

33:49.485 --> 33:50.570
very slowly,

33:50.653 --> 33:55.491
one inch to your left,
so I can get to the pin.

33:55.575 --> 33:58.202
Oh, no, I can't...
I can't, I can't do it.

34:00.705 --> 34:01.873
Are you all right?

34:03.374 --> 34:05.168
Have you, uh,
heard anything?

34:05.251 --> 34:06.669
They have
to deactivate.

34:06.753 --> 34:07.628
I got a key.

34:07.712 --> 34:09.380
A legend
to the blueprint.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.174
-Baker gave you this?
-No.

34:11.257 --> 34:13.551
His wife gave it to me.
They came for Baker.

34:14.635 --> 34:16.804
All right, well, this
makes more sense.

34:18.473 --> 34:22.268
These, uh, these symbols
aren't for p-traps, they're...

34:22.351 --> 34:24.729
they're microphones.

34:24.812 --> 34:26.731
And the letter "V"
isn't for vacuum,

34:28.191 --> 34:29.400
that's a generator.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.323
This is a line
of JZ33 land mines

34:35.573 --> 34:37.575
buried eighty millimeters
underground,

34:37.658 --> 34:39.577
about seven feet
from the outer wall.

34:39.660 --> 34:41.746
That's must be what
Linc was talking about.

34:44.749 --> 34:48.127
It says,
"Manual override only.

34:48.211 --> 34:51.172
"All conventional attempts
to dismantle the JZ33

34:51.255 --> 34:52.924
will activate
the Scylla alarms."

34:54.634 --> 34:56.135
This isn't just a land mine.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.138
This is, uh...
this is an alarm.

35:01.682 --> 35:03.267
We can't sit here
all night.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.437
Okay?

35:08.147 --> 35:09.440
You ready?

35:23.329 --> 35:27.083
Hey, it's Linc.
You know what to do.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.136
What are you doing?

35:54.152 --> 35:55.987
Linc!

35:56.070 --> 35:58.489
Sucre!

36:03.536 --> 36:04.954
Stop!

36:05.037 --> 36:06.080
Stop!

36:06.164 --> 36:07.081
Don't move.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.082
Don't move.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.375
Don't move.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.046
You can't dismantle
the land mine

36:14.130 --> 36:15.256
without setting off
the alarm.

36:15.339 --> 36:16.841
So I either
set off the alarm

36:16.924 --> 36:17.925
or blow up and die.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.469
NO. There's a manual
override.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.223
It'll cut the power
long enough for you

36:24.307 --> 36:27.685
to step off
without removing the pin.

36:27.768 --> 36:29.395
How do you know for sure?

36:29.478 --> 36:31.230
I found David Baker.

36:38.821 --> 36:39.739
Sucre, step off.

36:40.489 --> 36:41.908
You can do it.
You only have

36:41.991 --> 36:43.367
twenty seconds.
Come on.

36:43.451 --> 36:45.494
-I can't...
-Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

36:45.578 --> 36:46.579
Michael and I figured it out.

36:46.662 --> 36:47.830
Step off right now.

36:47.914 --> 36:48.998
No, no, you guys all go.
I'll...

36:49.081 --> 36:50.958
We all don't have to die.
I'll do it alone.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.627
Nobody's gonna die today!

36:52.710 --> 36:53.878
Step off!

36:58.216 --> 36:59.425
Step off.

37:39.465 --> 37:41.050
What's behind this wall?

37:42.176 --> 37:43.511
Scylla.

38:08.327 --> 38:09.787
When do you find out?

38:11.372 --> 38:15.376
The doctor is supposed
to call, uh... any minute.

38:15.459 --> 38:17.211
Look, um...

38:17.295 --> 38:19.797
I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you today.

38:22.383 --> 38:23.467
Don't worry about it.

38:23.551 --> 38:24.760
You know, what Gretchen did
for Sucre

38:24.844 --> 38:27.430
made me realize
we could use her.

38:27.513 --> 38:29.432
I asked for the sixth key.

38:29.515 --> 38:30.766
What'd she say?

38:31.851 --> 38:32.935
She's on it.

38:43.195 --> 38:44.280
You all right?

38:45.114 --> 38:46.115
All right.

38:46.198 --> 38:47.074
We're about to go
to the airfield.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.243
We're gonna ship Brad's body
off to his mother.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.244
We've got his things here.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.829
Where is he?

38:52.496 --> 38:53.706
Over here.

39:49.512 --> 39:51.514
His mom
will appreciate that.

40:15.746 --> 40:17.206
Mrs. Bellick,

40:17.289 --> 40:19.166
this is Fernando Sucre.

40:31.345 --> 40:33.180
Great job today.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.349
I'm sorry to hear
about your friend.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.851
But that's, um,
admirable work,

40:36.934 --> 40:39.728
volunteering with a bunch
of criminals like that.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.730
We're all the same, really.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.942
Here's the application
you requested

40:45.025 --> 40:46.193
for the desk girl.

40:47.319 --> 40:49.280
You have
a good night, Cole.

40:49.363 --> 40:50.614
You, too. Thanks.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.892
Hello?

41:19.643 --> 41:21.020
Hello?

41:24.690 --> 41:25.566
Okay.

41:25.691 --> 41:26.650
We will.

41:26.775 --> 41:27.818
Thank you.

41:28.277 --> 41:29.945
As we've all learned
the hard way,

41:30.029 --> 41:32.448
there's an electronic
alarm barrier

41:33.115 --> 41:36.118
around the perimeter
of the foundation.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.620
Unfortunately,

41:37.703 --> 41:40.956
that is Scylla's most primitive
line of defense.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.125
The wall itself

41:43.209 --> 41:45.294
is fortified with steel fiber.

41:46.212 --> 41:48.255
The good news is,
on the inside here,

41:49.006 --> 41:50.382
there are no cameras.

41:51.425 --> 41:52.426
The Company doesn't want any

41:52.510 --> 41:54.386
visual evidence
that Scylla exists.

41:54.553 --> 41:56.347
The bad news is
that there are both

41:56.430 --> 41:59.975
weight and microphonic
sensors here and here

42:00.309 --> 42:01.769
that will alert
Company Security

42:01.852 --> 42:04.438
to the presence of any
breathing human being

42:04.522 --> 42:07.066
that weighs more
than two pounds.

42:07.274 --> 42:08.359
Um...

42:09.818 --> 42:11.362
as far
as I can tell,

42:12.821 --> 42:15.866
the first challenge is getting
around that wall.

42:15.950 --> 42:18.911
And then we can worry about
crossing the floor.

42:18.994 --> 42:20.955
Without touching it.

42:21.038 --> 42:22.456
In silence.

42:23.707 --> 42:25.084
It's complicated.

42:25.167 --> 42:27.586
But, uh, I'm already
working on something.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.218
Brad didn't die in vain.

42:35.678 --> 42:37.221
We can make this work.

42:48.440 --> 42:50.109
That was the neurologist.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.529
You have a hypothalamus
hamaratoma.

42:54.029 --> 42:54.947
It's really rare.

42:55.030 --> 42:56.532
You were probably
born with it.

42:57.992 --> 43:00.869
Um, things have changed.
It's been growing,

43:00.953 --> 43:03.080
which is why you've been
experiencing your symptoms.

43:04.623 --> 43:06.625
And the doctor feels
that you need surgery.

43:08.502 --> 43:09.587
Two days.

43:09.670 --> 43:11.505
That's, uh,
that's what I need.

43:12.131 --> 43:13.132
Tomorrow.

43:13.215 --> 43:16.343
Otherwise you could die,
and there's no alternative.
