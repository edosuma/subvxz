00:12.485 --> 00:14.005
[wind whistling]

00:23.485 --> 00:24.525
[screams]

00:38.645 --> 00:40.125
Where am I?

00:42.685 --> 00:43.685
Hello?

00:44.805 --> 00:46.045
Hello!

00:46.965 --> 00:48.245
Anyone?

00:55.165 --> 00:57.365
Morning, Sandeep. Morning!

00:57.965 --> 00:59.405
New hair, Karen? Lovely.

00:59.725 --> 01:01.965
I love the smell of law in the morning!

01:04.365 --> 01:05.765
-Ken.
-Jane.

01:05.845 --> 01:07.365
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

01:07.445 --> 01:10.205
-What do<i> you</i> think is going on?
-I think you've come into the office

01:10.285 --> 01:13.165
ignoring the fact that you've been
suspended, hoping we'll let it go

01:13.245 --> 01:15.405
out of some sense of British awkwardness.

01:15.485 --> 01:17.285
Right. Well, you're way off.

01:17.365 --> 01:19.645
You're in serious danger
of losing your job permanently.

01:19.725 --> 01:22.045
-No,<i> you</i> are.
-Look, I really think--

01:22.125 --> 01:24.925
No, no. Can this wait? I've actually got
quite a lot to be getting on with, so--

01:25.005 --> 01:27.685
No. You really don't.

01:29.725 --> 01:31.285
No-one likes you, Jane.

01:32.005 --> 01:34.165
Everyone says so round the water cooler.

01:34.245 --> 01:35.685
Ken, you've left me with no choice.

01:36.245 --> 01:38.885
I'm calling a board meeting for 4 p.m.
to decide your future.

01:38.965 --> 01:41.285
You have ten minutes to plead your case.

01:41.365 --> 01:43.885
Then I will see you in court.

01:43.965 --> 01:46.205
It won't be in court.
It's in the boardroom.

01:46.285 --> 01:48.725
It's a turn of phrase, Jane.

01:51.605 --> 01:52.885
Told you it wouldn't work.

01:52.965 --> 01:54.485
It was your idea.

01:54.565 --> 01:56.725
"Go in there with your head held high,"
you said.

01:56.805 --> 01:59.205
"No one will question
your natural authority," you said.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.725
I even took a packed lunch.

02:00.805 --> 02:02.325
I didn't think
you were actually going to do it!

02:02.405 --> 02:05.165
Now I have to go back in at 4 p.m. today
and beg for my job.

02:05.245 --> 02:09.085
A disgraced lawyer, dodging former
colleagues in the supermarket,

02:09.165 --> 02:13.085
before ending up glued to his sofa
in a soiled man nappy.

02:13.165 --> 02:14.685
I'm so sorry, love.

02:17.245 --> 02:20.645
But... if you've got nothing to do
till four,

02:21.165 --> 02:22.485
how about you take the car back?

02:23.605 --> 02:25.205
-What?
-Well, you said yourself,

02:25.285 --> 02:26.765
the monthly payments are killing you.

02:26.845 --> 02:28.445
And now you don't have a job.

02:28.525 --> 02:29.965
I might still have a job!

02:30.045 --> 02:31.525
Yeah, but it's looking a bit shaky.

02:32.085 --> 02:35.445
Ken, it's a little excessive.
The hands-free,

02:35.525 --> 02:38.325
the onboard computer
you don't know how to use,

02:38.405 --> 02:42.165
the snazzy cup-holder.
Isn't it all a bit midlife crisis?

02:42.245 --> 02:47.285
No. A Volvo XC90 is not a midlife crisis
and I do know how to use that computer,

02:47.365 --> 02:48.605
I just need some more practice!

02:49.525 --> 02:53.165
Lorna, I didn't get a Vespa.
I'm having a bloody cup-holder!

02:53.245 --> 02:55.125
-All right, Mum, you ready?
-Yep!

02:55.205 --> 02:57.565
Fucking hell, dressed by 11?

02:57.645 --> 02:59.605
You must've raced through
your morning dump.

03:00.365 --> 03:02.165
You can be high and mighty with me,
young man,

03:02.245 --> 03:04.765
when you're doing something more virtuous
than flogging phones to morons.

03:04.845 --> 03:07.605
Erm, I think you mean valuable customers,
Dad.

03:07.685 --> 03:09.925
No, if they're buying a phone off you,
they're a moron.

03:10.005 --> 03:12.405
Well, at least
I'm bringing home the bacon.

03:13.005 --> 03:16.005
Tell you what,
treat yourself to something nice.

03:17.485 --> 03:18.645
Bye, love.

03:19.045 --> 03:21.805
Oh, he thinks he's won.
You think you've won! Well, you haven't.

03:21.885 --> 03:24.365
I've got your £20
and I<i> will</i> buy myself something nice.

03:25.485 --> 03:26.525
Prick.

03:28.405 --> 03:29.565
[sighs heavily]

03:31.045 --> 03:32.765
-Oh, that's weird.
-What's weird, Chief Ken?

03:33.325 --> 03:36.365
Rachel hasn't made her move
on Words With Friends.

03:36.445 --> 03:40.045
Must be still reeling from my crippling
deployment of "zygote"

03:40.125 --> 03:41.325
on a triple point score. [scoffs]

03:41.965 --> 03:44.445
She's not reeling. She's just got
no reception in the Pennines.

03:45.765 --> 03:47.045
-In the Pennines?
-Yeah.

03:47.125 --> 03:49.765
-It's a mountain range.
-I know what the Pennines are, Dale.

03:49.845 --> 03:52.525
-Why is Rachel there?
-Because I put her there.

03:52.605 --> 03:54.605
It's the closest place to the outback
I could find.

03:54.685 --> 03:56.685
What? It's nothing like the outback.

03:56.765 --> 03:58.525
Nowhere in the UK is like the outback.

03:58.605 --> 04:01.285
Well, I mean there are parts of Kent,
but my point is,

04:01.365 --> 04:04.965
why have you stranded my daughter
in the outback... The Pennines?

04:05.045 --> 04:06.525
For a walkabout.

04:06.605 --> 04:08.205
When aborigines search for answers,

04:08.285 --> 04:10.085
they strand themselves in the outback.

04:11.005 --> 04:13.485
So, are you saying that... ?

04:14.365 --> 04:16.005
OK, start from the beginning.

04:16.085 --> 04:17.205
It's pretty simple, Ken.

04:17.285 --> 04:20.805
So, Rachel said she needed more space
to think about her path in life,

04:20.885 --> 04:24.045
so, I found the place in England
with the most space there is.

04:24.605 --> 04:26.125
And then I deserted her there!

04:26.205 --> 04:28.165
Please, tell me,
with food and water and...

04:28.245 --> 04:30.805
-Nope. With nothing!
-Oh, my God.

04:34.165 --> 04:37.005
[answerphone]<i> Hi, it's Rachel.</i>
<i>Sorry I can't get to the phone right now.</i>

04:37.085 --> 04:38.085
<i>Please leave a--</i>

04:38.165 --> 04:42.005
Great! So now I have to go and rescue
Rachel from the Pennines

04:42.085 --> 04:45.445
and you've picked the day where I have
a meeting to decide the fate of my career.

04:45.525 --> 04:48.045
Oh, come on, Ken.
I couldn't have predicted that.

04:48.125 --> 04:50.765
Let's face it, you haven't had
a lot of meetings recently.

04:51.805 --> 04:53.085
Get in the car!

04:56.685 --> 04:58.325
-[wind whistles]
-[Rachel] Oh, come on!

04:59.325 --> 05:00.525
Come on.

05:05.485 --> 05:06.645
Oh, fucking...

05:07.005 --> 05:08.005
Dylan!

05:09.245 --> 05:11.765
You promised me this had full coverage.

05:16.045 --> 05:17.445
What the...?

05:26.085 --> 05:28.365
[Dale, on tape]<i> Rachel.</i>
<i>If you're listening to this,</i>

05:28.445 --> 05:30.965
<i>it means you've found the Walkman</i>
<i>and pressed play</i>

05:31.045 --> 05:33.805
<i>and had the headphones on</i>
<i>when you did that. Kudos!</i>

05:33.885 --> 05:36.845
<i>You said you wanted space,</i>
<i>so I gave it to you.</i>

05:36.925 --> 05:38.285
<i>But I also gave you much more.</i>

05:38.365 --> 05:41.085
<i>A double-sided cassette</i>
<i>of my voice covering topics</i>

05:41.165 --> 05:43.525
<i>like spiritual lessons I've learned</i>
<i>to keep you company</i>

05:43.605 --> 05:45.325
<i>as you find your way back to me.</i>

05:45.645 --> 05:47.765
<i>So... keep listening.</i>

05:48.245 --> 05:50.445
<i>-The aborigines...</i>
-[tape winds forward]

05:50.525 --> 05:53.405
<i>...using the mucus from a kangaroo pouch!</i>

05:53.485 --> 05:54.885
[tape winds forward again]

05:54.965 --> 05:57.205
<i>...but it was only ever in his mind.</i>

05:57.285 --> 05:58.965
[tape winds forward again]

05:59.045 --> 06:01.125
[as Crocodile Dundee]
<i>"That's not a knife. This is a knife."</i>

06:02.165 --> 06:04.365
<i>But when you are lost, Rachel,</i>

06:04.445 --> 06:07.245
<i>you need to give yourself to the universe</i>

06:07.325 --> 06:10.445
<i>and the universe will provide salvation.</i>

06:11.485 --> 06:13.725
<i>It may come in a strange form.</i>

06:14.245 --> 06:15.965
<i>A form you didn't expect.</i>

06:16.965 --> 06:19.565
[voice echoing]<i> Like the form</i>
<i>of a spirit guide.</i>

06:19.645 --> 06:23.845
<i>You just need to reach your hand out</i>
<i>and grab it.</i>

06:27.765 --> 06:30.165
Oh! Thank God I found you.

06:31.005 --> 06:33.965
I'm lost. Can you help me, please?

06:35.125 --> 06:36.685
Fuckin' hell.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.445
This was supposed to be
getting away from it all.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.965
Two days I've got in the past five years
just to be on my own.

06:44.045 --> 06:48.805
No kids, no terrapins,
no sex addiction therapy sessions.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.405
What's that?

06:50.485 --> 06:52.405
It's my Kendal Mint Cake,

06:52.485 --> 06:54.365
and, no, you can't have any.

06:54.925 --> 06:57.325
[sighs] Please.

06:58.045 --> 06:59.765
Fine. If you really are lost...

07:00.685 --> 07:02.565
I shall be your guide.

07:05.365 --> 07:08.045
But only to the car park off the A515.

07:16.285 --> 07:18.725
[switching between radio stations]

07:22.285 --> 07:25.045
[chuckles] Oh, this is great, Chief Ken.

07:25.125 --> 07:26.925
Just two guys on the open highway.

07:28.405 --> 07:30.005
We're not on the highway, Dale.

07:30.365 --> 07:31.765
We're on the A515.

07:33.485 --> 07:34.885
I mean, what the hell were you thinking?

07:35.725 --> 07:37.565
I was just following your advice, Ken.

07:37.645 --> 07:39.685
How's any of this
got anything to do with me?

07:39.765 --> 07:41.645
You were the one who told me
I need to grow up,

07:41.725 --> 07:43.005
so I started to do what you do:

07:43.085 --> 07:45.525
watch documentaries on BBC Four all day.

07:45.605 --> 07:48.005
And that's where I learned about
the aborigines.

07:48.085 --> 07:49.765
Pretty easy to connect the dots, Ken.

07:50.365 --> 07:52.285
Nothing here connects, Dale.

07:52.365 --> 07:54.285
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

07:54.365 --> 07:57.205
Oh, really? Well, if you want to
do something to help,

07:57.285 --> 07:59.205
tell me what hill she's on.
I'll enter it into the sat-nav.

07:59.285 --> 08:01.885
I don't know, Ken,
there are a lot of hills.

08:01.965 --> 08:03.925
I mean, the outback is a pretty big place.

08:04.005 --> 08:05.685
The Pennines is not the outback!

08:05.765 --> 08:07.805
That kind of depends on
your point of view.

08:07.885 --> 08:09.365
-No, it depends on geography.
-When you think about it,

08:09.445 --> 08:10.845
aren't we all just geography?

08:11.885 --> 08:13.405
Oh, for God's sake.

08:13.485 --> 08:15.125
-I can fix it.
-Just leave it.

08:15.205 --> 08:17.205
-I can fix it.
-Just bloody leave it.

08:22.565 --> 08:24.245
[window whirrs]

08:35.125 --> 08:36.725
Stop!

08:41.725 --> 08:43.164
Oh. Wait.

08:43.245 --> 08:45.044
-What?
-You want to be helpful?

08:45.125 --> 08:46.605
-Yes.
-Get the iPad out of the back,

08:46.684 --> 08:48.125
use that app.
Then we can track her phone.

08:48.205 --> 08:50.085
Oh, yes, brilliant, Chief Ken.

08:50.165 --> 08:52.485
You are a huge man with a huge brain.

08:53.365 --> 08:54.365
All right.

08:55.085 --> 08:56.845
Come on, come on.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.165
-Yep, I found her!
-OK.

08:59.245 --> 09:00.525
And she's close.

09:00.605 --> 09:02.645
-She's on the A515.
-OK, good.

09:02.725 --> 09:04.085
We're on the A515.

09:04.925 --> 09:06.885
-Heading north.
-All right.

09:06.965 --> 09:08.645
OK. We're heading north.

09:10.605 --> 09:12.485
Dale...

09:12.565 --> 09:13.925
which junction is she off?

09:15.205 --> 09:17.525
Uh, she's just passing junction 17.

09:19.285 --> 09:20.325
OK.

09:20.405 --> 09:23.085
Do you think there's a chance
that you're tracking that iPad?

09:23.165 --> 09:24.125
No.

09:24.205 --> 09:25.805
[iPad beeps]

09:27.765 --> 09:29.365
-Yes, I have done that.
-Right.

09:30.365 --> 09:33.845
Well, I'm going to have to do something
I never thought I would do.

09:33.925 --> 09:36.205
-Run that 5K?
-No, I'm going to do that.

09:36.285 --> 09:39.165
No, I'm going to call Dylan
and ask for his help.

09:40.005 --> 09:42.885
Computer... call Dylan.

09:45.005 --> 09:46.285
Phone Dylan!

09:48.165 --> 09:50.085
-Fuck...
-[computer]<i> Please repeat name--</i>

09:50.165 --> 09:52.165
Dylan. Phone Dylan!

09:53.205 --> 09:56.485
[exaggeratedly clearly] Phone Dylan.
Dylan Thomp-son.

09:56.565 --> 09:58.685
<i>Playing popular songs by Chumbawamba.</i>

09:58.765 --> 09:59.885
[Ken] Fuck it!

10:00.845 --> 10:02.645
[Rachel] Are you, like,
a real person, right?

10:03.165 --> 10:05.205
My tape said something
about spirit guides,

10:05.285 --> 10:09.005
and I know you're not a real spirit guide,
but I'm having boyfriend troubles,

10:09.085 --> 10:11.925
and I just wondered if you could,

10:12.005 --> 10:13.845
you know, while we're here, Debbie,

10:13.925 --> 10:16.365
just tell me what to do with my life.
[laughs]

10:17.125 --> 10:18.605
I'm<i> not</i> a spirit guide.

10:19.165 --> 10:21.845
I'm just a lone woman wandering the hills
who found you in the mist

10:21.925 --> 10:24.725
in your moment of need.
And I'm aware that what I just said

10:24.805 --> 10:26.725
makes me sound like a spirit guide,
but I'm not.

10:26.805 --> 10:32.205
So, can you just be quiet for at least
the rest of the time we spend together?

10:35.685 --> 10:36.805
[sighs]

10:40.045 --> 10:42.125
[phones ringing]

10:42.845 --> 10:44.245
Hello, Phone 4Now, how can--

10:44.325 --> 10:48.005
<i>Dylan, it's Dad. I'm ringing from</i>
<i>the hands-free in the car.</i>

10:48.085 --> 10:49.565
Is that supposed to impress me
or something?

10:49.645 --> 10:50.965
Well, frankly, yes.

10:51.045 --> 10:53.485
Listen, Dale has stranded your sister
in the wilderness

10:53.565 --> 10:55.925
for reasons that are impossible to fathom.

10:56.005 --> 10:57.965
[he chuckles]
What, like a sort of walkabout?

10:58.045 --> 10:59.045
Exactly!

11:00.125 --> 11:01.885
You sold her a phone, right?

11:01.965 --> 11:03.605
Yeah, you bet I did.

11:03.685 --> 11:06.445
Totally rinsed her.
We call it the mug package.

11:06.525 --> 11:08.925
Right. I'm not sure you should be
quite so proud of that.

11:09.005 --> 11:11.405
Says you. They let me ring the big bell.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.405
Look, can you locate her phone?

11:14.485 --> 11:18.645
Defo. But that's a service I can only
really offer a customer.

11:18.725 --> 11:20.925
Or, as you might say, a moron.

11:21.685 --> 11:22.805
Right...

11:22.885 --> 11:25.645
We do have some amazing packages,
Mr. Thompson.

11:25.725 --> 11:27.765
OK, what's the cheapest contract
you've got?

11:27.845 --> 11:31.405
£12.99 a month, but unfortunately
we're out of stock.

11:31.485 --> 11:34.125
Oh, sounds like your phones
are really flying off the shelves.

11:34.205 --> 11:35.565
Don't encourage him!

11:35.645 --> 11:38.725
[Dylan]<i> We do, however,</i>
<i>have our top phone in stock.</i>

11:38.805 --> 11:41.525
That's just £50 a month
with a small upfront charge

11:41.605 --> 11:43.405
of just £89.99.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.285
Just find your sister's phone.

11:45.365 --> 11:47.925
No problem. Just hold the line
for one second, please.

11:50.325 --> 11:51.685
[big bell rings]

11:55.845 --> 11:57.965
<i>Sorry about that, Mr. Thompson.</i>

11:58.045 --> 12:00.645
It looks like Rachel's phone is...

12:01.845 --> 12:04.685
out of reception. I'll let you know
when she comes online.

12:04.765 --> 12:09.205
Right. So, this whole thing
was just one giant waste of money.

12:09.285 --> 12:12.005
Not for me.
Just made Salesman of the Week.

12:12.085 --> 12:14.125
Computer, hang up immediately!

12:14.805 --> 12:17.485
You know,
sometimes I really hate my own son.

12:17.565 --> 12:20.005
<i>-I can still hear you, Dad.</i>
-Good!

12:25.525 --> 12:28.325
-[phone rings]
-[Rachel] Oh! Finally.

12:31.285 --> 12:32.245
Oh.

12:33.165 --> 12:35.765
-Nina?
-Oh, Rachel, finally.

12:35.845 --> 12:37.925
-[wind whistling]
-Are you in a wind tunnel?

12:38.005 --> 12:39.925
No, it's a bad line.

12:40.005 --> 12:43.165
Oh, OK. Look, well, look, a job's come up,
a real one,

12:43.245 --> 12:45.965
<i>with hungry kids and buckets</i>
<i>and everything.</i>

12:46.045 --> 12:47.285
Just exactly what you wanted.

12:47.365 --> 12:49.205
And, like,
the kids are really, really hungry.

12:49.285 --> 12:50.925
Oh, that sounds amazing!

12:51.565 --> 12:52.765
-Where is it?
-Um,

12:52.845 --> 12:54.365
it's in Sierra Nevada.

12:54.965 --> 12:56.245
<i>Or Leone.</i>

12:56.325 --> 12:58.245
I forget. The African one.

12:58.325 --> 13:00.205
[breaking up]<i> I'm going to need an answer</i>
<i>pretty soon, because...</i>

13:00.285 --> 13:02.325
Nina? Nina, I can't hear you.

13:02.845 --> 13:04.805
I'll call you back.

13:09.845 --> 13:11.045
"Zygote."

13:11.125 --> 13:13.925
Oh, Dad, you monster!

13:18.445 --> 13:19.485
[whispering] Fuck.

13:20.085 --> 13:22.445
Jane, board members...

13:23.565 --> 13:25.845
I can only apologise for my behaviour.

13:25.925 --> 13:28.085
It does not reflect who I am.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.765
Those of you who know me best
will know me as a good man,

13:31.845 --> 13:34.005
and someone who should have won
Lawyer of the Year, but--

13:34.085 --> 13:35.685
-Dingo!
-Dale...

13:36.205 --> 13:37.525
it's another sheep!

13:37.605 --> 13:39.445
And I'm trying to rehearse my speech here.

13:39.525 --> 13:41.485
Sorry, Chief Ken. You're just
not really holding my attention.

13:41.565 --> 13:44.325
God, you are more like your father
than you realise.

13:44.405 --> 13:45.445
Did he like dingoes too?

13:45.525 --> 13:48.605
Oh! Please... listen.

13:48.685 --> 13:51.205
You are intending to marry my daughter,

13:51.285 --> 13:53.645
a fact that through some elaborate form
of Stockholm syndrome

13:53.725 --> 13:57.365
I've come to accept.
But, for the sake of my sanity,

13:57.445 --> 14:01.365
I need to know that you can hold
a normal conversation with me,

14:01.445 --> 14:02.965
your potential father-in-law.

14:03.045 --> 14:04.805
So, please...

14:05.365 --> 14:07.685
No dingoes, no walkabout.

14:07.765 --> 14:09.965
Just talk to me like a human being.

14:10.045 --> 14:12.285
[laughing] OK.
This is going to be exciting!

14:12.365 --> 14:14.765
-OK.
-What are we going to talk about?

14:14.845 --> 14:17.805
Well... Did you watch the rugby?

14:21.245 --> 14:23.285
-You lost me, Ken.
-Oh, Jesus Christ.

14:24.645 --> 14:26.965
[phone rings] Oh, at last! Dylan.

14:27.045 --> 14:28.365
Computer, answer the phone.

14:28.445 --> 14:30.965
[computer]<i> The outside temperature</i>
<i>is five degrees.</i>

14:31.045 --> 14:32.525
-I'll do it myself!
<i>-Dad?</i>

14:32.605 --> 14:34.765
Rachel must have walked through
some reception.

14:34.845 --> 14:36.365
I can tell you where she is.

14:36.445 --> 14:38.805
Thank you. Some good news. Where is she?

14:38.885 --> 14:41.925
<i>I said I</i> can<i> tell you.</i>
<i>I didn't say I</i> would<i> tell you.</i>

14:42.805 --> 14:44.445
You little rat!

14:44.525 --> 14:45.805
How much is this going to cost me?

14:45.885 --> 14:47.765
<i>It's just an extra £15 a month,</i>

14:47.845 --> 14:50.085
and I'll throw in a free
Pokémon phone case.

14:50.165 --> 14:52.205
-Oh, cool!
-This is highway robbery!

14:52.285 --> 14:54.445
-A515 robbery.
-Shut up, Dale.

14:54.525 --> 14:57.885
Right, so I'll send over Rachel's location
in a dropped pin.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.485
You can open that
on your inboard sat-nav, right?

15:00.565 --> 15:02.005
Yes. Yes, of course I can.

15:02.805 --> 15:04.125
Let's see, um...

15:05.085 --> 15:06.805
[computer]<i> Airbag disabled.</i>

15:06.885 --> 15:09.605
[Dylan]<i> Ha! You massive twat!</i>

15:11.165 --> 15:12.525
[Rachel] It is a bit weird.

15:13.525 --> 15:17.005
I met you, now I've been offered this job.

15:17.405 --> 15:20.045
Do you think the universe
is trying to tell me something?

15:21.405 --> 15:24.885
But if it is, it's telling me to leave
the man of my dreams.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.565
And do I really want to do that?

15:27.165 --> 15:28.485
You know what I think?

15:31.565 --> 15:34.245
Your choices in life,
they don't really matter.

15:34.325 --> 15:36.205
-Really?
-Yeah.

15:36.285 --> 15:38.925
I'm never going to see you again.
I don't give a shit what you do!

15:40.485 --> 15:42.045
That is not nice!

15:42.125 --> 15:44.405
Must be here. I'm in Settings...

15:45.525 --> 15:47.565
-Map...
-[computer beeps]

15:48.045 --> 15:49.685
Oh, maybe it's this one.

15:49.765 --> 15:51.165
[beeping]

15:51.245 --> 15:54.005
-Oh, no, that's the car seat!
-OK.

15:54.725 --> 15:56.445
Wow! [laughs]

15:56.525 --> 15:58.645
It goes backwards and forwards
with the touch of a button.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.805
-Oh, my God.
-Back, forwards, back...

16:02.845 --> 16:04.325
Uh-oh. It's stopped working.

16:04.405 --> 16:05.445
Oh, well done!

16:05.525 --> 16:07.845
-[beeping]
-There.

16:09.485 --> 16:12.245
Oh, no. Jesus Christ!

16:12.325 --> 16:14.805
-What?
-She's the other side of the Pennines!

16:15.445 --> 16:17.765
I'm never going to make the meeting now.

16:17.845 --> 16:19.125
And we need petrol.

16:19.205 --> 16:21.485
Oh, God. That's it, it's over.

16:21.565 --> 16:23.245
Jane is going to jump on this like a...

16:23.325 --> 16:25.285
-Dingo?
-No, not like a dingo!

16:31.205 --> 16:32.605
I'm going to be out on the street.

16:32.685 --> 16:36.165
I mean, this is a spacious car,
but will it house an entire family?

16:37.045 --> 16:39.005
Oh, God. I'm sweating.

16:39.925 --> 16:40.925
I'm shaky!

16:41.005 --> 16:42.525
That's your massage seat, Ken.

16:42.605 --> 16:46.565
I'm going to die. I'm going to die
in a petrol station on the A515.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.605
I need to get some air.

16:55.005 --> 16:57.245
Chief Ken, take a deep breath, OK?

16:57.325 --> 17:00.445
We got this. We can find Rachel
and make it back in time

17:00.525 --> 17:02.485
for your meeting if we multitask.

17:02.565 --> 17:07.165
I'll do the gas, you go inside.
Get yourself a nice relaxing pasty, OK?

17:07.245 --> 17:10.165
I'm not going to be placated by a pasty,
Dale.

17:10.245 --> 17:13.245
The idea that hot steak and potato chunks
surrounded by delicious,

17:13.324 --> 17:15.324
flaky pastry are going to
make things better?

17:15.405 --> 17:16.485
Honestly!

17:17.805 --> 17:19.405
Yeah, I might get a pasty, actually.

17:19.485 --> 17:20.765
Yeah. [laughs]

17:20.844 --> 17:22.965
Oh, and I'm going to use
Dylan's 20 to do it!

17:23.045 --> 17:24.165
-[laughing] All right!
-Yes!

17:31.245 --> 17:34.125
[Dale, on tape]<i> If there's one</i>
<i>final piece of advice, Rachel,</i>

17:46.045 --> 17:48.125
<i>Hit it, Dylan!</i> [he beatboxes]

17:49.365 --> 17:51.285
Would you please just give me
a bit of that?

17:51.365 --> 17:54.525
-No.
-I am lost, OK?

17:54.605 --> 17:57.365
Here... but also here.

17:58.045 --> 18:01.085
And whether you like it or not,
destiny has chucked us together...

18:01.165 --> 18:02.725
[exhales loudly]
Will you just give me a break?

18:03.365 --> 18:04.885
Rachel, I want you to take this.

18:10.245 --> 18:11.565
Chuck it in the bin, will you?

18:16.685 --> 18:18.005
[huffs]

18:22.245 --> 18:24.645
But I still don't understand
why it stopped.

18:25.285 --> 18:27.085
I mean, I put so much diesel in it.

18:31.045 --> 18:33.325
-[sighs]
-OK. I can see you're upset, Ken,

18:33.405 --> 18:34.805
but I was only trying to help.

18:35.245 --> 18:37.365
Like you tried to help Rachel
by stranding her in the wilderness.

18:37.445 --> 18:39.965
And you helped Sid
by cutting off his foreskin.

18:40.045 --> 18:43.005
And you encouraged me to buy that pasty
that you knew I'd eat too quickly

18:43.085 --> 18:44.365
and give myself indigestion!

18:44.445 --> 18:46.165
OK, I put my hands in the air, Ken.

18:46.245 --> 18:47.885
I've made mistakes, OK?

18:48.685 --> 18:51.405
But I promise you, I will learn from them,

18:51.485 --> 18:53.245
and I will never make
the same mistake twice.

18:53.685 --> 18:57.205
No, you'll probably make new ones
and outdo yourself.

18:57.965 --> 19:01.765
Look, Dale, you're a nice bloke,
but that means you get away with a lot.

19:01.845 --> 19:03.365
And sometimes, honestly,

19:03.445 --> 19:06.045
I can't help but wonder
if you're not just a bloody idiot!

19:08.325 --> 19:10.205
Oh, not that.

19:10.285 --> 19:11.805
I can't bear that.

19:12.205 --> 19:14.485
Dale, not the bottom lip.

19:15.685 --> 19:17.885
Oh, don't cry. Look, I didn't mean it.

19:19.565 --> 19:21.805
-It's not what you said, Chief Ken.
-[exasperated sigh]

19:22.245 --> 19:23.725
It's that you're right.

19:24.165 --> 19:25.565
I<i> am</i> an idiot.

19:26.205 --> 19:27.845
And I'm not worthy of Rachel.

19:28.685 --> 19:31.485
-And if she does live through this--
-She's going to live through this.

19:31.565 --> 19:34.965
I'm going to tell her,
if I'm stupid enough to put diesel

19:35.045 --> 19:37.885
in your petrol car,
then we shouldn't get married.

19:37.965 --> 19:41.445
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's an easy mistake to make, son.

19:41.525 --> 19:42.685
Anybody could've made it.

19:42.765 --> 19:45.205
Don't go breaking up over this, lads.

19:46.885 --> 19:48.525
-What?
-Listen.

19:48.605 --> 19:51.725
I've been married 34 years,
and I can tell you,

19:51.805 --> 19:53.685
happiness is a hard thing to come by.

19:54.605 --> 19:57.645
Especially for a man of your age
and... shape,

19:57.725 --> 20:00.885
with a lovely young lad like this,
as beautiful as he is.

20:00.965 --> 20:03.485
-Thank you.
-Hold on to it.

20:03.565 --> 20:05.925
Don't let it go over a tankful of diesel!

20:09.245 --> 20:11.365
-Is the car fixed?
-Good as new.

20:11.445 --> 20:13.085
You know the cup-holder's broken?

20:13.165 --> 20:15.045
[yelling] I know the cup-holder's broken!

20:29.605 --> 20:31.925
[sat-nav]<i> You have arrived</i>
<i>at your destination.</i>

20:32.005 --> 20:33.245
[Ken] Finally!

20:38.045 --> 20:39.445
Rachel!

20:40.085 --> 20:41.805
Rachel!

20:43.405 --> 20:44.765
Oi! Oi!

20:44.845 --> 20:46.685
She's over there!

20:51.445 --> 20:53.485
Rach, I'm<i> so</i> sorry.

20:53.565 --> 20:55.285
You bloody should be!

20:56.125 --> 20:58.325
I needed time to think, not some kind of

20:58.405 --> 21:00.565
non-consensual Duke of Edinburgh.

21:01.325 --> 21:03.725
It's like Chief Ken says,
I'm not really good at anything.

21:04.565 --> 21:05.925
Except maybe capoeira.

21:06.005 --> 21:07.605
So totally batshit, Dale.

21:08.485 --> 21:11.045
But... it<i> was</i> good to have some space.

21:12.365 --> 21:13.845
Really good, actually.

21:13.925 --> 21:16.845
-I'm really glad you're safe, love.
-Thank you.

21:18.605 --> 21:21.365
Well, actually, you've got someone
to thank for that.

21:21.445 --> 21:24.965
A stranger who I weirdly thought
was a spirit guide for a while.

21:25.645 --> 21:27.685
Guys, I'd like you to meet...

21:35.645 --> 21:37.965
Right. Can we get on the road?

21:47.525 --> 21:49.525
One hour till the meeting.
I think we can make it

21:49.605 --> 21:51.125
if I put this thing into sports mode.

22:02.725 --> 22:05.165
-[Rachel] Oh, my God!
-[Ken] What the fuck?

22:05.525 --> 22:07.325
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

22:13.645 --> 22:16.685
-I can't believe what happened.
-This is the man of your dreams?

22:20.645 --> 22:21.885
[Debbie] Oh! Ow!

22:21.965 --> 22:22.965

22:23.045 --> 22:25.725
It's 5:30. They're probably
all in the Baker's Arms by now.

22:28.525 --> 22:30.485
Jane, it's Ken. Listen...

22:31.085 --> 22:33.165
[Jane] Where on earth are you?
We're all waiting.

22:33.245 --> 22:35.605
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>
<i>Look, you've probably realised by now</i>

22:35.685 --> 22:36.805
<i>I'm not going to make the meeting.</i>

22:36.885 --> 22:39.125
I am so, so sorry.

22:39.205 --> 22:40.925
[line breaks up]

22:45.725 --> 22:48.205
Actually... I'm not sorry.

22:48.285 --> 22:49.725
[breaking up]<i> I'm not sorry.</i>

22:49.805 --> 22:52.045
You see, my daughter was in danger,

22:52.525 --> 22:54.965
and I made a choice
to prioritise my family.

22:55.045 --> 22:57.485
[line breaks up completely]

22:57.565 --> 23:01.045
And I take those principles to work
every day,

23:01.125 --> 23:03.925
and I represent the underdog,
the working man.

23:04.005 --> 23:06.125
[breaking up]<i> You dog. Jane...</i>

23:06.205 --> 23:07.765
I know you think I hate you.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.165
[breaking up]<i> I hate you.</i>

23:09.245 --> 23:10.765
I don't hate you.

23:10.845 --> 23:12.325
[breaking up]<i> I hate you.</i>

23:12.405 --> 23:15.325
So, please, let's start anew...

23:16.085 --> 23:20.485
and work together to build a firm
where we all want to be.

23:22.325 --> 23:23.525
Good day to you.

23:24.085 --> 23:26.005
[breaking up]<i> A firm... f... you.</i>

23:27.285 --> 23:30.365
I motion we finally fire Ken Thompson.

23:30.445 --> 23:32.685
-Seconded.
-Approved.

23:35.045 --> 23:36.365
Goodbye, Ken.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.885
-Baker's Arms?
-[all] Yes.

23:42.765 --> 23:45.045
Well, if that doesn't do it, nothing will.
