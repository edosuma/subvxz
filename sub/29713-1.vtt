[makes shooting sounds]

00:57.124 --> 01:00.793
Yeah, apparently Katie is
like seeing somebody else, but
it's actually a good thing,

01:00.795 --> 01:02.728
'cause I don't want
any distractions
when I go over there.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.662
Yeah, apparently Katie is
like seeing somebody else, but
it's actually a good thing,

Yeah, apparently Katie is
like seeing somebody else, but
it's actually a good thing,

01:08.135 --> 01:11.403
I need to be focused, you know?
This is my chance.

You got any more of those?

01:31.392 --> 01:35.727
-If Mom sees you, she's...
-If Mom sees either of us.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.710
Look, Andy, I just...

01:54.849 --> 01:58.283
I want you to know
I'm proud of you, okay?

02:00.421 --> 02:03.322
Being a part
of something like this

02:03.324 --> 02:04.523
is a tremendous thing.

02:04.524 --> 02:05.723
Being a part
of something like this

03:05.352 --> 03:07.553
What's up, Briggman?

03:07.555 --> 03:08.637
What's up, Rayburn?

03:08.638 --> 03:09.720
What's up, Briggman?

03:10.357 --> 03:13.525
You're attracted to me
right now, aren't you?

03:13.527 --> 03:15.227
A little bit, yeah. Wow.

03:15.228 --> 03:16.928
You're attracted to me
right now, aren't you?

03:32.213 --> 03:34.413
You're good.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.552
So this is what it's like
to work at the DMV.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.437
[Rayburn] We did these guys
three days ago.

03:41.438 --> 03:42.321
So this is what it's like
to work at the DMV.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.038
[Weppler]
Last week too, same fucking guy.

03:43.039 --> 03:43.754
So this is what it's like
to work at the DMV.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.574
LT wants us to check full
biometrics. Get cheek swabs too.

03:45.575 --> 03:47.392
So this is what it's like
to work at the DMV.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.360
We're just going to let
these goatfuckers go anyway.

03:48.361 --> 03:49.327
So this is what it's like
to work at the DMV.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.113
We can't arrest nobody,
we can't fuckin' shoot nobody.

03:51.114 --> 03:52.897
So this is what it's like
to work at the DMV.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.717
Arms up.
Come on, arms up.

03:54.718 --> 03:56.535

What is he saying?

04:01.541 --> 04:02.273
So this is what it's like
to work at the DMV.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.542
Stop! Don't make me use force.

04:03.543 --> 04:04.809
So this is what it's like
to work at the DMV.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.312
[laughs]

04:07.314 --> 04:08.080
For God's sakes, Briggman.

04:08.081 --> 04:08.847

04:08.849 --> 04:10.182
Alright, that's enough!

[laughs]

04:11.652 --> 04:12.918

04:12.920 --> 04:14.219
I said, that's enough!

04:14.220 --> 04:15.519
Briggman.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.798
You look like the fucking
Terminator in these things.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.784
You'll scare the daylights
out of these people.

04:28.785 --> 04:30.769
You look like the fucking
Terminator in these things.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.338
And you.

04:33.340 --> 04:34.957
Look there. See them kids?

04:34.958 --> 04:36.575
And you.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.010
Mmm.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.013
Raise your right hand.

04:43.284 --> 04:47.319
Move it repeatedly
in a side-to-side motion.

04:50.357 --> 04:51.390
Now smile.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.225
That's right.
Wave and smile.

I feel like a
goddamn prom queen.

04:59.866 --> 05:00.965
Now smile.

05:00.968 --> 05:01.717
[laughter]

05:01.718 --> 05:02.467
Now smile.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.585
Fuck you say, Rayburn?

05:03.586 --> 05:04.702
Now smile.

05:04.972 --> 05:09.474

[staff sergeant]
Now I'mma go over there
and give those kids some candy.

05:16.550 --> 05:20.052

us having to do
some security detail tomorrow?

06:05.898 --> 06:06.997
Did you hear this bullshit about

06:07.000 --> 06:08.383
Sit down with the local
elder leaders or some shit?

Another KLE?

I swear to God, the LT drinks
more tea than Queen Fucking
Elizabeth.

06:12.855 --> 06:14.905
Did you hear this bullshit about

06:14.908 --> 06:17.843
If Sergeant Wallace could see us
now, he'd be laughin' his ass
off, huh?

06:17.844 --> 06:20.779
Did you hear this bullshit about

Yeah, well, he's not, so...

-This everybody?
-Hooah.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.070
[Rayburn]
Morning, Sergeant.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.547
My name is Staff Sergeant Deeks.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.566
Some of you may think I'm here
to replace Sergeant Wallace.

07:30.567 --> 07:32.584
My name is Staff Sergeant Deeks.

07:33.720 --> 07:39.458
I've been around long enough to
know you don't just replace
a man.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.076
I'm here to lead,
plain and simple.

07:41.077 --> 07:42.693
I've been around long enough to
know you don't just replace
a man.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.247
I've got three combat tours
under my belt. I move fast,
I don't fuck around.

07:45.248 --> 07:47.799
I've been around long enough to
know you don't just replace
a man.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.001

from all of you.

I've been around long enough to
know you don't just replace
a man.

07:56.643 --> 08:00.212
-It's the usual bullshit.
-Oh, yeah?

08:00.214 --> 08:01.497
We stand around
sweating our balls off,

08:01.498 --> 08:02.781

-Yes, sergeant.

08:10.724 --> 08:11.757
You're dismissed.

-Yes, sergeant.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.163
You're dismissed.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.500
Go back to your hooch.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.611
This is our mission.

wired to Russian UXO.

08:33.897 --> 08:35.179
This is our mission.

08:35.182 --> 08:35.948
Whoever's making these
has to answer

08:35.948 --> 08:36.715
This is our mission.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.734
for the deaths of 24 American
soldiers in the past 12 months.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.751
This is our mission.

08:40.754 --> 08:41.986
Now, these motherless fucks

08:41.988 --> 08:43.221
This is our mission.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.023
are holed up right here,
in our AO.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.824
This is our mission.

08:46.827 --> 08:47.476
And every day
we don't find them

08:47.477 --> 08:48.126
This is our mission.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.345
is another day an American
soldier could come home in
pieces.

08:50.346 --> 08:52.563
This is our mission.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.734
Just like Sergeant Wallace did.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.836
Who wants to make a difference?

08:57.838 --> 08:58.971
That's not a
rhetorical question.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.105
Who wants to make a difference?

09:00.107 --> 09:01.373
Who wants to make
a fucking difference?

09:01.374 --> 09:02.640
Who wants to make a difference?

09:02.643 --> 09:03.625
[all] Hooah!

09:03.626 --> 09:04.608
Who wants to make a difference?

09:09.550 --> 09:09.981
Good.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.417
I'm gonna make you a deal.
You give me your loyalty

09:12.418 --> 09:14.852
Good.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.471
and I guarantee
that each and every one you

09:16.472 --> 09:18.088

09:18.091 --> 09:19.391
will have a chance
to be a warrior,

09:19.392 --> 09:20.692
Good.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.477
to actually do something
out here,

09:22.478 --> 09:24.261
Good.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.547
to be a part of history

09:25.548 --> 09:26.831
Good.

09:28.001 --> 09:31.903
instead of reading
about it in some book.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.811
What are you doing?

10:12.813 --> 10:13.395
Relationship building, Sergeant.

10:13.396 --> 10:13.978
What are you doing?

10:13.981 --> 10:15.931
Don't do that.
Village is shady a fuck.

10:15.932 --> 10:17.882
What are you doing?

10:17.884 --> 10:18.967
Roger that, Sergeant.

10:18.968 --> 10:20.051
What are you doing?

10:20.053 --> 10:21.136
So, gentlemen, what's the play?

10:21.137 --> 10:22.220
What are you doing?

10:22.222 --> 10:23.171
Put on a strong show of force.

10:23.172 --> 10:24.121
What are you doing?

10:24.124 --> 10:26.141
-Show of force?
-Yes, sir.

10:26.142 --> 10:28.159
What are you doing?

10:28.161 --> 10:28.693
Is he serious?

10:28.694 --> 10:29.226
What are you doing?

10:29.229 --> 10:30.128
I don't know where he gets
this shit, Sergeant.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.028
What are you doing?

10:31.031 --> 10:32.664
[Deeks]
Ever been hunting, Briggman?

10:32.665 --> 10:34.298
What are you doing?

10:34.301 --> 10:35.801
Yeah, my dad used to take me,
he was in the Marines.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.302
What are you doing?

10:37.304 --> 10:38.120
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

10:38.121 --> 10:38.937
What are you doing?

10:38.939 --> 10:39.588
Any combat tours?

10:39.589 --> 10:40.238
What are you doing?

10:40.240 --> 10:41.623
No, he worked a desk.

10:41.624 --> 10:43.007
What are you doing?

10:43.010 --> 10:44.493
Cool. So when your desk-job
dad spotted a buck,

10:44.494 --> 10:45.977
What are you doing?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.395
did he roll up in
his four-by-four?

10:47.396 --> 10:48.812
What are you doing?

10:48.815 --> 10:50.265
No, that would scare away
the animals.

10:50.266 --> 10:51.716
What are you doing?

10:52.719 --> 10:54.285
Mmm.

10:55.389 --> 10:58.189
[Deeks]
Briggman, you're with me.

11:11.672 --> 11:16.841

12:49.136 --> 12:50.869
So I take this stun grenade...

12:50.871 --> 12:52.654
and I pop it...
and I drop it in the stall.

12:52.655 --> 12:54.438
So I take this stun grenade...

12:54.441 --> 12:55.440
Bang!

12:55.441 --> 12:56.440
So I take this stun grenade...

12:56.443 --> 12:57.893
Brendan,
the poor fucking bastard,

12:57.894 --> 12:59.344
So I take this stun grenade...

12:59.346 --> 13:01.246
he comes out the stall
screaming: "Jesus Christ!"

13:01.247 --> 13:03.147
So I take this stun grenade...

13:03.150 --> 13:04.032
[laughs]

13:04.033 --> 13:04.915
So I take this stun grenade...

13:04.918 --> 13:05.717
[Andrew] And that's,
like exactly when the
MPs rolled up,

13:05.718 --> 13:06.517
So I take this stun grenade...

13:06.520 --> 13:09.287
and they put cuffs on him
because they thought he'd gone
Section 8.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.055
So I take this stun grenade...

13:12.058 --> 13:13.124
[laughs]

13:13.125 --> 13:14.191
So I take this stun grenade...

13:18.431 --> 13:21.166
[knocks on door]

13:21.168 --> 13:21.833
Sergeant...

13:21.834 --> 13:22.499

-This is one of my new friends.
<i> -What's his name?</i>

14:00.006 --> 14:03.141
[Andrew] Sorry to barge in
like this, Sergeant.

14:03.143 --> 14:06.261
I put together a list of IED
attacks by date and location.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.380
[Andrew] Sorry to barge in
like this, Sergeant.

14:13.553 --> 14:17.522
Why aren't you smoking hash
with the rest of your squad?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.941
Wait, what? I don't know
anything about that.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.359
Why aren't you smoking hash
with the rest of your squad?

14:22.495 --> 14:24.295
You don't know
what I'm talking about?

14:24.297 --> 14:27.449
This truck in the motor pool?
Smoke wafting out of the hatch?

14:27.450 --> 14:30.602
You don't know
what I'm talking about?

14:30.604 --> 14:32.037
I don't...

14:32.038 --> 14:33.471
You don't know
what I'm talking about?

14:39.446 --> 14:42.113
I wanted to speak with you.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.548
You have my undivided attention.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.982
I wanted to speak with you.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.084
I've got a promotion board
coming up.

14:46.085 --> 14:47.184
I wanted to speak with you.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.386
You want me to put you in

14:48.387 --> 14:49.586
I wanted to speak with you.

14:49.589 --> 14:50.321
Yes. Yeah.

14:50.322 --> 14:51.054
I wanted to speak with you.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.841
[Deeks] I've got six guys
trying for that job.

14:52.842 --> 14:54.626
I wanted to speak with you.

14:54.628 --> 14:56.011
You want it?

14:56.012 --> 14:57.395

15:05.104 --> 15:06.203
Convince me.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.607
-He's been gone
like half an hour.
-[knocks on door]

15:08.608 --> 15:11.009
Convince me.

15:12.646 --> 15:13.244
Shh!

15:13.246 --> 15:14.963
-What the fuck do we do?
-Open the door.

15:14.964 --> 15:16.681
Shh!

15:31.631 --> 15:35.466
[Deeks] Evening, boys.
What are you up to?

16:05.165 --> 16:09.968
This is not good.

16:11.371 --> 16:15.106
Go see my man Darwesh
at the ANA camp.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.775
He'll get you the primo shit.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.443
Go see my man Darwesh
at the ANA camp.

16:27.454 --> 16:31.289
-What the fuck...?

16:31.291 --> 16:32.440
[heavy metal music plays]

16:32.441 --> 16:33.590
-What the fuck...?
-[laughs]

17:09.596 --> 17:13.064
[Rayburn]
Can you pass me that deodorant?

17:13.199 --> 17:14.398
There you go.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.884
Man, I'm thinkin' about
getting some more ink.

17:15.885 --> 17:17.367
There you go.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.354
-Yeah?
-Like a skull right there?

17:19.355 --> 17:21.339
There you go.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.991
Why don't you get one
on your ass? "Insert wood here".

17:22.992 --> 17:24.642
There you go.

17:24.644 --> 17:24.959
Yeah?

17:24.960 --> 17:25.275
There you go.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.711
You know what those are,
don't you?

17:26.712 --> 17:28.145
There you go.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.449
The skulls on Deeks' legs?

17:31.451 --> 17:32.967
Red ones from Iraq,
blue from Afghanistan.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.484
The skulls on Deeks' legs?

17:36.689 --> 17:39.157
Do I have to spell it out
for you?

17:39.159 --> 17:40.375
What are you trying to say?

17:40.376 --> 17:41.592
Do I have to spell it out
for you?

17:41.594 --> 17:43.594
He killed like, what,
twelve fucking dudes?

17:43.595 --> 17:45.595
Do I have to spell it out
for you?

17:45.598 --> 17:47.498
You don't win wars
zip-tying people.

17:47.499 --> 17:49.399
Do I have to spell it out
for you?

17:49.636 --> 17:52.303
I was with Deeks in Ramadi.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.255
This one day, he was
on the checkpoint. SAW gunner.

17:54.256 --> 17:56.206
I was with Deeks in Ramadi.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.009
He had a car coming towards him.
Crammed with towelheads.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.810
I was with Deeks in Ramadi.

17:59.813 --> 18:00.712
-Like, Fedayeen?
-No.

18:00.713 --> 18:01.612
I was with Deeks in Ramadi.

18:01.614 --> 18:04.482
A family. Mom, Dad, little kid,
the whole fucking deal.

18:04.483 --> 18:07.351
I was with Deeks in Ramadi.

18:07.353 --> 18:08.886
They wouldn't stop, so...

18:08.887 --> 18:10.420
I was with Deeks in Ramadi.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.823
Jesus fucking Christ.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.224
I was with Deeks in Ramadi.

18:13.226 --> 18:13.775
Fucked up, right?

18:13.776 --> 18:14.325
I was with Deeks in Ramadi.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.810
[makes buzzer sound]
Wrong.

18:15.811 --> 18:17.294
I was with Deeks in Ramadi.

18:17.297 --> 18:17.729
Opened up the trunk,

18:17.730 --> 18:18.162
I was with Deeks in Ramadi.

18:18.164 --> 18:19.981
hundred pounds of HME
stuffed in a fucking suitcase.

18:19.982 --> 18:21.799
I was with Deeks in Ramadi.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.618
Enough to barbecue
the whole goddam platoon.

18:23.619 --> 18:25.436
I was with Deeks in Ramadi.

18:25.572 --> 18:29.674
That's how depraved
these fucking animals are.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.042
Incinerate their own kids

18:31.043 --> 18:32.409
That's how depraved
these fucking animals are.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.762
just to get a few of ours.

18:33.763 --> 18:35.113
That's how depraved
these fucking animals are.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.698
That's why we need
guys like Deeks.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.282
That's how depraved
these fucking animals are.

18:39.185 --> 18:41.119
Fucking hard.

18:52.232 --> 18:56.234
-Coombs, how do you like
it cooked?
-Medium rare, Staff Sergeant.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.519
Medium rare, coming right up.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.803
-Coombs, how do you like
it cooked?
-Medium rare, Staff Sergeant.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.810
[Deeks] Hey! Don't forget
your reading material.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.746
Enjoy.

19:08.748 --> 19:09.514

Enjoy.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.572
[Deeks] 3-2 and 3-3 will
approach on the main road
from the north.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.857
Enjoy.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.259
I'll be stationed on the south
side, down here with 3-1.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.660
Enjoy.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.245
Ready to roll at 16:30.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.829
Enjoy.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.732
Questions.

19:27.734 --> 19:28.333
Good, one more piece
of business.

19:28.334 --> 19:28.933
Questions.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.836
As you all know, we have a spot
open on 3-2 for vehicle
commander.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.738
Questions.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.208
Specialist Marquez?

19:37.677 --> 19:38.442
Yes, Sergeant.

19:38.444 --> 19:41.095
I understand you've expressed an
interest in a team leader
position, is that correct?

19:41.096 --> 19:43.747
Yes, Sergeant.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.349
Hooah.

19:44.350 --> 19:44.949
Yes, Sergeant.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.118
-Have you completed your IAVC?
-Roger that.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.286
Yes, Sergeant.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.422
[Deeks] Very good.

19:50.423 --> 19:51.556
Yes, Sergeant.

19:52.258 --> 19:56.827
Now, what would you say
if I gave the job to Briggman?

20:04.938 --> 20:05.937
I...

20:05.939 --> 20:07.272
I wouldn't know,
I wouldn't suggest...

20:07.273 --> 20:08.606
I...

20:08.608 --> 20:09.974
Not exactly
a ringing endorsement.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.341
I...

20:11.344 --> 20:12.460
You can't do that, Sergeant.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.577
I...

20:13.713 --> 20:17.682
Interesting theory.
Let's test it.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.117
Briggman, the job is yours.

20:19.118 --> 20:20.551
Interesting theory.
Let's test it.

20:23.756 --> 20:24.522
It worked.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.174
-Thank you so much, Sergeant.
-You're welcome.

20:26.175 --> 20:27.825
It worked.

20:27.827 --> 20:28.843
Just one little thing.

20:28.844 --> 20:29.860
It worked.

20:30.396 --> 20:33.664
You need to put Marquez
on his back.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.469
What?

20:38.471 --> 20:40.738
You put him into submission.

20:40.739 --> 20:43.006
What?

20:43.009 --> 20:45.343
Otherwise I'll assume you're
not qualified for the job.

20:45.344 --> 20:47.678
What?

21:08.801 --> 21:11.802
I'm gonna enjoy this, bro.

21:13.539 --> 21:15.439
Straight up.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.524
[laughs]

21:16.525 --> 21:17.608
Straight up.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.126
Yeah!

Straight up.

21:18.645 --> 21:19.227
-Come on, man!
-Come on!

21:19.228 --> 21:19.810
Straight up.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.112
-Let's go Briggsy!
-Let's do this, come on!

21:21.113 --> 21:22.413
Straight up.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.448
Get in there!

21:23.449 --> 21:24.482
Straight up.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.286
[soldiers cheer]

21:28.554 --> 21:29.987
[soldiers] Whoa!

21:29.989 --> 21:31.455

Fuck off!

21:40.866 --> 21:41.932
[soldier]
No, no!

21:48.441 --> 21:50.474
[soldier]
He just licked his ear!

21:50.476 --> 21:50.758
[soldier]
Yes!

21:50.759 --> 21:51.041
[soldier]
He just licked his ear!

21:51.044 --> 21:52.777
-I got him.
-[Marquez]
Lick my fucking ear...

21:52.778 --> 21:54.511
[soldier]
He just licked his ear!

21:54.514 --> 21:54.762
I got him.

21:54.763 --> 21:55.011
[soldier]
He just licked his ear!

21:55.014 --> 21:56.797
[Weppler] Marquez, you owe me
a pack of smokes now.

21:56.798 --> 21:58.581
[soldier]
He just licked his ear!

21:58.584 --> 22:00.051
[Weppler]
I did not see that coming.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.519
[soldier]
He just licked his ear!

22:01.721 --> 22:03.454
[Coombs] Crazy.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.173
[soldier]
You see that? Briggman!

22:05.174 --> 22:06.891
[Coombs] Crazy.

22:06.893 --> 22:07.792
[Andrew]
Hey, Dad.

22:07.793 --> 22:08.692
[Coombs] Crazy.

22:08.695 --> 22:09.761
Guess what, I'm team leader.

22:09.762 --> 22:10.828
[Coombs] Crazy.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.362
[William]
<i> Team leader?</i>

22:11.363 --> 22:11.895
[Coombs] Crazy.

22:11.898 --> 22:12.714
Got my own truck,
got my own soldier too.

22:12.715 --> 22:13.531
[Coombs] Crazy.

22:13.533 --> 22:14.549
[Andrew] <i> Things are</i>
<i> really taking off for me.</i>

22:14.550 --> 22:15.566
[Coombs] Crazy.

22:15.568 --> 22:16.734
Is that why you've been
ignoring us?

[Andrew]
Would you rather be

22:32.801 --> 22:33.483
[Coombs] Crazy.

22:33.486 --> 22:35.603
in a boxing ring and fight
a hundred duck-size horses

22:35.604 --> 22:37.721
[Coombs] Crazy.

22:37.724 --> 22:38.740
or one enormous,
horse-size duck?

22:38.741 --> 22:39.757

Stand back!

23:12.458 --> 23:14.392
[Andrew] Sergeant?

23:14.394 --> 23:15.677
EOD is clearing the highway
north of the blast site.

23:15.678 --> 23:16.961
[Andrew] Sergeant?

23:16.963 --> 23:17.862
Afghan police are tracking leads
on the bomber's last-knowns.

23:17.863 --> 23:18.762
[Andrew] Sergeant?

23:18.765 --> 23:22.166
Afghan police couldn't track
dogshit if it were stuck to
their boots.

[Andrew] Sergeant?

23:27.774 --> 23:32.610

23:37.065 --> 23:38.648
-Help you with something else?
-Yeah, it's...

23:42.688 --> 23:46.690
If you're going to get
emotional, don't do it here.

23:49.662 --> 23:50.861
Did you hear what I just said?

23:50.863 --> 23:52.013

24:00.288 --> 24:02.605
Did you hear what I just said?

24:06.946 --> 24:08.946
That's quite a manifesto.

Yeah, well, you don't win wars
zip-tying people.

24:10.766 --> 24:12.583
That's quite a manifesto.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.620
I want to show you something.

24:26.732 --> 24:31.602
Bravo Company found him
last night, out by the highway.

24:33.906 --> 24:36.707
He planted the IEDs?

24:37.610 --> 24:41.779
No, but I bet you a case
of Coors he knows who did.

24:44.050 --> 24:47.151
What are we supposed
to do with him?

24:47.153 --> 24:48.102
Not we.

24:48.103 --> 24:49.052

32:44.212 --> 32:45.962
I was wrong about you.

32:45.965 --> 32:46.647
No, I am, I'm just...

32:46.648 --> 32:47.330
I was wrong about you.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.333
Logistics could use a smart guy
like you back at camp.

32:49.334 --> 32:51.334
I was wrong about you.

32:51.337 --> 32:52.203
You're good with
computers, right?

32:52.204 --> 32:53.070
I was wrong about you.

32:53.072 --> 32:53.888
No....Sergeant,
you don't have to do that.

32:53.889 --> 32:54.705
I was wrong about you.

32:54.707 --> 32:56.190
Work a desk, like your father.

32:56.191 --> 32:57.674
I was wrong about you.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.009
No, Sarge, I want to stay.

32:59.010 --> 33:00.343
I was wrong about you.

33:00.546 --> 33:03.380
We kill people.

33:04.249 --> 33:06.550
It's what we do.

33:07.486 --> 33:10.153
Do you have a problem with that?

33:10.522 --> 33:12.990
No, Sergeant.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.394
No, Sergeant!

33:46.692 --> 33:50.660
Here he is,
Mister Sunshine and Rainbows.

33:51.797 --> 33:54.097
How are you feeling?

33:54.099 --> 33:55.332
I feel fine.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.566
How are you feeling?

33:56.568 --> 33:57.117
Here.

33:57.118 --> 33:57.667
How are you feeling?

33:57.669 --> 33:59.002
Let's see if we can fix that.

33:59.003 --> 34:00.336
How are you feeling?

34:16.188 --> 34:19.556
-Hey, man.
-[Rayburn] Yeah?

34:19.558 --> 34:21.123
What was it like
killing that guy?

34:21.125 --> 34:22.690
-Hey, man.
-[Rayburn] Yeah?

34:33.839 --> 34:37.641
Did you ever hear
of a conscience round?

34:38.710 --> 34:40.110
No?

34:40.112 --> 34:41.862
Okay, so my dad...

34:41.862 --> 34:43.612
No?

34:44.583 --> 34:48.685
He was like this major
history buff, and...

34:48.687 --> 34:49.937
and he told that
in 18-whatever,

34:49.938 --> 34:51.188
He was like this major
history buff, and...

34:51.190 --> 34:53.424
they used to execute spies
by firing squad.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.659
He was like this major
history buff, and...

34:55.661 --> 34:56.677
But you see, occasionally,

34:56.678 --> 34:57.694
He was like this major
history buff, and...

34:57.696 --> 34:59.446
the shooters would freeze up
and couldn't pull the trigger.

34:59.447 --> 35:01.197
He was like this major
history buff, and...

35:01.200 --> 35:02.750
So they came up with this idea.

35:02.751 --> 35:04.301
He was like this major
history buff, and...

35:04.303 --> 35:05.969
They would load one
of the rifles with a blank.

35:05.970 --> 35:07.636
He was like this major
history buff, and...

35:08.607 --> 35:12.776
-And the blank was the
conscience round?
-Yeah.

35:16.448 --> 35:20.283
Now, nobody knew
which gun had the blank.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.501
Not that it mattered.

35:21.502 --> 35:22.718
Now, nobody knew
which gun had the blank.

35:22.721 --> 35:23.770
Once you put
that one blank into the mix,

35:23.771 --> 35:24.820
Now, nobody knew
which gun had the blank.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.356
suddenly it's not
"I'm shooting this person",

35:26.357 --> 35:27.890
Now, nobody knew
which gun had the blank.

35:27.893 --> 35:31.028
it's "we're shooting this
person." It's all of us.

35:31.029 --> 35:34.164
Now, nobody knew
which gun had the blank.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.566
And that's the key.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.035
It's the group.

35:38.036 --> 35:39.503
And that's the key.

35:39.705 --> 35:44.508
Once you figure that out,
you can shoot anybody you want.

35:44.510 --> 35:46.060
And never lose a wink of sleep.

35:46.061 --> 35:47.611
Once you figure that out,
you can shoot anybody you want.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.656
Goodnight, Briggman.

37:56.842 --> 38:00.877
Yo, Brigsey.
What is the good word, my man?

38:00.879 --> 38:01.311
You forgot to sign this.

38:01.312 --> 38:01.744
Yo, Brigsey.
What is the good word, my man?

38:01.747 --> 38:03.530
It's the shooter's statement
from the KIA. The kid.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.314
Yo, Brigsey.
What is the good word, my man?

38:16.928 --> 38:18.828
-Yo, Brigsey.
-Yeah.

38:18.830 --> 38:19.813
You're hovering.

38:19.814 --> 38:20.797
-Yo, Brigsey.
-Yeah.

38:20.799 --> 38:21.615
Sorry. Um...

38:21.616 --> 38:22.432
-Yo, Brigsey.
-Yeah.

38:22.567 --> 38:26.903
You said that the kid threw
a Russian RGD grenade, right?

38:26.905 --> 38:27.737
Yeah, so?

38:27.738 --> 38:28.570
You said that the kid threw
a Russian RGD grenade, right?

38:28.707 --> 38:33.743
Just wondering
because it exploded.
How did you know it was an RGD?

38:34.680 --> 38:37.047
Because I saw it in his hand.

38:37.049 --> 38:38.465
But you were fifty meters away.
How did you see that?

38:38.466 --> 38:39.882
Because I saw it in his hand.

38:39.885 --> 38:41.184
What is this with the questions?

38:41.185 --> 38:42.484
Because I saw it in his hand.

38:42.754 --> 38:45.455
I'm sorry, I just, uh...

38:45.757 --> 38:49.592
It just seemed like
a funny detail to call out.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.394
Yeah, well,
like I always say, Brigsey,

38:51.396 --> 38:52.896
stories are
all about the details.

38:52.897 --> 38:54.397
Yeah, well,
like I always say, Brigsey,

38:55.834 --> 38:57.834
We done?

38:58.670 --> 39:02.038
Yeah.
Cool.

39:03.475 --> 39:04.441
I need to see the Captain.

39:04.443 --> 39:05.409
Can you tell me when he's
around? It's very important.

39:05.410 --> 39:06.376
I need to see the Captain.

39:06.378 --> 39:06.927
I'm not his fucking secretary.

39:06.928 --> 39:07.477
I need to see the Captain.

39:07.479 --> 39:08.612
But you know when he's around.
You know when he's free.

39:08.613 --> 39:09.746
I need to see the Captain.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.415
-Talked to Sergeant Deeks yet?
-No.

39:11.416 --> 39:13.083
I need to see the Captain.

39:13.085 --> 39:14.384
Chain of command, dude.

39:14.385 --> 39:15.684
I need to see the Captain.

39:20.392 --> 39:22.826
Please. Three minutes.

39:23.895 --> 39:26.529
It's all I need.

40:13.779 --> 40:15.011
[Coombs] Oh, fuck!

40:15.013 --> 40:16.546
[Coombs]
Take it fucking easy, man!

40:16.547 --> 40:18.080
[Coombs] Oh, fuck!

40:21.486 --> 40:23.553
[Coombs] Stop digging
into my fucking arm!

40:23.555 --> 40:25.522
[Weppler] Man the fuck up
and hold still.

40:25.523 --> 40:27.490
[Coombs] Stop digging
into my fucking arm!

40:38.904 --> 40:41.671
[Rayburn] Hey, yo, Brigsey.
You should see this, man.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.123
Coombs is getting a big
fat cock tattooed on his arm!

40:43.124 --> 40:44.574
[Rayburn] Hey, yo, Brigsey.
You should see this, man.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.109
-Hold still, man.
-It's not a cock.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.643
[Rayburn] Hey, yo, Brigsey.
You should see this, man.

40:47.979 --> 40:51.748
-Oh, shit!
-Shit! What the fuck, man?

40:51.750 --> 40:52.349
[Weppler] I see it, man.

40:52.350 --> 40:52.949
-Oh, shit!
-Shit! What the fuck, man?

40:52.951 --> 40:53.466
It looks like a fucking dick!

40:53.467 --> 40:53.982
-Oh, shit!
-Shit! What the fuck, man?

40:53.985 --> 40:55.785
[Weppler]
I'm sorry, I didn't see that...

40:55.786 --> 40:57.586
-Oh, shit!
-Shit! What the fuck, man?

41:02.561 --> 41:05.495
[Coombs]
You fucking piece of shit!

41:05.497 --> 41:06.496
[Weppler]
How do you want me to fix it?

41:06.497 --> 41:07.496
[Coombs]
You fucking piece of shit!

41:07.499 --> 41:08.715
[Coombs] Do you understand...

41:08.716 --> 41:09.932
[Coombs]
You fucking piece of shit!

41:10.769 --> 41:12.469
[Rayburn] Yo, Brigsey.

41:12.471 --> 41:13.570
[Coombs] Yo, fuck you!
Shut the fuck up!

41:13.571 --> 41:14.670
[Rayburn] Yo, Brigsey.

41:14.673 --> 41:15.889
Yo, Brigsey, you comin' or what?

41:15.890 --> 41:17.106
[Rayburn] Yo, Brigsey.

41:19.778 --> 41:21.678
Yep!

41:48.807 --> 41:49.906
Yo. Yo.

41:49.908 --> 41:51.074
You guys seen Deeks?

41:51.075 --> 41:52.241
Yo. Yo.

41:52.244 --> 41:53.610
You seen Deeks?

41:53.611 --> 41:54.977
Yo. Yo.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.715
Do you know where Deeks is?

42:02.787 --> 42:03.553
Alright, look.

42:03.555 --> 42:05.088
He told me not to say anything,
but CID called him in.

42:05.089 --> 42:06.622
Alright, look.

42:06.625 --> 42:07.240
Yeah.
Some kind of investigation.

42:07.241 --> 42:07.856
Alright, look.

42:07.859 --> 42:10.060
Something about an anonymous
tip. That's all I know.

42:10.061 --> 42:12.262
Alright, look.

42:12.264 --> 42:13.046
Yo, cut the gloomy shit.

42:13.047 --> 42:13.829
Alright, look.

42:13.832 --> 42:15.699
Deeks knows how to handle this.
Okay?

42:15.700 --> 42:17.567
Alright, look.

42:18.703 --> 42:24.240
Whoever ratted us, better pray
to God Deeks doesn't find him.

42:30.248 --> 42:31.814
-Yo, Briggman.
-Yo.

42:31.816 --> 42:33.466
-Deeks is looking for you.
-What? You saw him?

42:33.467 --> 42:35.117
-Yo, Briggman.
-Yo.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.086
Yeah, he just got
back to his tent.

42:36.087 --> 42:37.053
-Yo, Briggman.
-Yo.

42:37.055 --> 42:39.439
Oh, and bro... he looks pissed.

42:39.440 --> 42:41.824
-Yo, Briggman.
-Yo.

43:02.681 --> 43:04.614
Hey, dude.

43:06.117 --> 43:08.251
[Deeks] You play?

43:11.256 --> 43:13.756
Ah, once or twice.

43:15.894 --> 43:17.260
[grunts]

43:47.325 --> 43:49.359
Once or twice, my ass.

43:49.361 --> 43:50.810
I learned a few moves
from my cousin.

43:50.811 --> 43:52.260
Once or twice, my ass.

43:53.665 --> 43:59.068
You know that anything
that happens out here
stays in the family, right?

44:01.973 --> 44:03.373
Of course.

44:03.375 --> 44:05.842
If you ever have any issues,
you'll come to me directly.

44:05.843 --> 44:08.310
Of course.

44:09.214 --> 44:11.714
I really appreciate that.

44:13.018 --> 44:14.951
Do you?

44:27.032 --> 44:29.732
[videogame voice]
<i> Shadow wins!</i>

44:29.901 --> 44:31.834
Look at that.

44:32.804 --> 44:34.671
You won.

45:08.740 --> 45:11.474
[Coombs] Yo, Brigsey.

45:11.476 --> 45:12.275
What the fuck you doin'?

45:12.276 --> 45:13.075
[Coombs] Yo, Brigsey.

45:13.078 --> 45:14.077
I'm just doing PMCS.

45:14.078 --> 45:15.077
[Coombs] Yo, Brigsey.

45:15.080 --> 45:16.229
Come on, let's go.
Team meeting.

45:16.230 --> 45:17.379
[Coombs] Yo, Brigsey.

45:17.382 --> 45:19.149
Now? What's the team
meeting about?

45:19.150 --> 45:20.917
[Coombs] Yo, Brigsey.

45:20.919 --> 45:22.135
Deeks caught a rat.

45:22.136 --> 45:23.352
[Coombs] Yo, Brigsey.

45:25.090 --> 45:26.923
Let's go.

45:35.967 --> 45:37.133
Briggman.

45:37.135 --> 45:37.784
What the fuck you doing?
Let's go.

45:37.785 --> 45:38.434
Briggman.

45:38.436 --> 45:40.753
I just remembered I left
the hatch open on the Stryker.

45:40.754 --> 45:43.071
Briggman.

45:43.074 --> 45:43.573
[Coombs] Deal with it later.

45:43.574 --> 45:44.073
Briggman.

45:44.075 --> 45:45.174
No, I think I'm gonna
go do that because Deeks is...

45:45.175 --> 45:46.274
Briggman.

45:46.277 --> 45:47.877
-gonna have my ass.
-Deeks is gonna have your ass?

45:47.878 --> 45:49.478
Briggman.

45:49.481 --> 45:50.163
He'll make an exception.

45:50.164 --> 45:50.846
Briggman.

45:50.849 --> 45:52.165
Trust me. Let's go.

45:52.166 --> 45:53.482
Briggman.

46:02.494 --> 46:03.926
Hey.

46:03.928 --> 46:05.495
Hope you don't mind
we started without you.

46:05.496 --> 46:07.063
Hey.

46:32.323 --> 46:34.157
[Rayburn] That goddam narc.

46:34.159 --> 46:36.977
He brought CID right into our
house. And for what?
Fucking hash?

46:36.978 --> 46:39.796
[Rayburn] That goddam narc.

46:40.431 --> 46:43.566
And it makes me wonder what
else he's been talking about.

46:43.568 --> 46:44.918
-Wait, that's why CID came here?
-Yeah.

46:44.919 --> 46:46.269
And it makes me wonder what
else he's been talking about.

46:46.271 --> 46:47.320
Yeah. Can you believe that shit?

46:47.321 --> 46:48.370
And it makes me wonder what
else he's been talking about.

46:49.307 --> 46:52.141
He called in an anonymous tip.

46:52.143 --> 46:53.159
But Deeks so in, Deeks
has ears everywhere.

46:53.160 --> 46:54.176
He called in an anonymous tip.

46:54.179 --> 46:55.311
You can't get
nothing past that dude.

46:55.312 --> 46:56.444
He called in an anonymous tip.

46:56.447 --> 46:57.630
[laughs]

46:57.631 --> 46:58.814
He called in an anonymous tip.

47:00.418 --> 47:02.552
Yo...

47:04.856 --> 47:07.924
We've got some big
missions coming up.

47:09.394 --> 47:10.493
Deeks has a lot
of stuff planned,

47:10.495 --> 47:13.413
so if you get a whiff of any
other punk-asses with
discretion issues,

47:13.414 --> 47:16.332
Deeks has a lot
of stuff planned,

47:16.334 --> 47:16.699
you let me know.

47:16.700 --> 47:17.065
Deeks has a lot
of stuff planned,

47:17.068 --> 47:19.202
They could spend the next six
weeks in Medical, like Marquez.

47:19.203 --> 47:21.337
Deeks has a lot
of stuff planned,

47:23.174 --> 47:24.040
Brigsey.

47:24.042 --> 47:25.442
Are you with us on this?

47:25.443 --> 47:26.843
Brigsey.

47:34.085 --> 47:36.252

47:44.095 --> 47:45.561
[Andrew] <i> Don't call CID.</i>
<i> Did you hear me?</i>

47:45.562 --> 47:47.028
Hello?

47:47.031 --> 47:47.530
Deeks hears everything.

47:47.531 --> 47:48.030
Hello?

47:48.032 --> 47:48.815
<i> He'll find out.</i>
<i> You have to stop.</i>

47:48.816 --> 47:49.599
Hello?

47:49.601 --> 47:50.366
No, look,
we've still got some moves here.

47:50.367 --> 47:51.132
Hello?

47:51.135 --> 47:52.368
-No, no, no.
-I just need you to stay calm.

47:52.369 --> 47:53.602

Dad?

47:57.675 --> 47:58.274
Hello?

47:58.276 --> 47:59.592
Dad? Dad? Fuck!

47:59.593 --> 48:00.909
Hello?

48:01.579 --> 48:03.412
Fuck.

48:15.093 --> 48:18.194
-[Rayburn] What do you got?
-[man speaks in Pashto]

48:18.196 --> 48:20.580
Bullshit. First Platoon got hit
two days ago,

48:20.581 --> 48:22.965
-[Rayburn] What do you got?
-[man speaks in Pashto]

48:24.535 --> 48:27.470

48:27.472 --> 48:28.004
What the fuck is he saying?

48:28.005 --> 48:28.537
[speaks in Pashto]

48:28.539 --> 48:29.422
He is complaining.
You are frightening his wife.

48:29.423 --> 48:30.306
[speaks in Pashto]

48:30.308 --> 48:31.140
I don't give a fuck
about your wife, bro.

48:31.141 --> 48:31.973
[speaks in Pashto]

48:31.976 --> 48:33.676
Briggman, put her inside.
Shoaid, go get the village
honcho.

48:33.677 --> 48:35.377
[speaks in Pashto]

48:35.380 --> 48:37.030
We need you to go inside.
Just go inside, please.
In there.

48:37.031 --> 48:38.681
[speaks in Pashto]

48:38.683 --> 48:39.165
[continues in Pashto]

48:39.166 --> 48:39.648
[speaks in Pashto]

48:39.651 --> 48:41.851
Just inside for now,
just inside for now, okay?

48:41.852 --> 48:44.052
[speaks in Pashto]

48:46.958 --> 48:49.325
[speaks in Pashto]

48:49.327 --> 48:50.476
Sit. Sit.

48:50.477 --> 48:51.626
[speaks in Pashto]

48:55.233 --> 48:56.232
[Rayburn] Stay there!

48:56.234 --> 48:58.468
Stay there. You people aren't
getting the fucking message!

48:58.469 --> 49:00.703
[Rayburn] Stay there!

49:00.705 --> 49:02.138
[Rayburn]
Where are you going?

49:02.139 --> 49:03.572
[Rayburn] Stay there!

49:03.574 --> 49:04.573
Goddamn it!

49:04.574 --> 49:05.573
[Rayburn] Stay there!

49:06.945 --> 49:09.045
[gunshots]

50:02.033 --> 50:04.133
[speaks in Pashto]

50:19.717 --> 50:22.785
Looks like they got
the message.

50:33.765 --> 50:37.400
[overlapping chatter]
-He's hyping this up--
-The last one you showed us--

50:37.402 --> 50:38.468
No, it's gonna be
these guys right here.

50:38.469 --> 50:39.535
[overlapping chatter]
-He's hyping this up--
-The last one you showed us--

50:39.537 --> 50:41.587
-Those ones?
-No, right...
these dumb fucks, man.

50:41.588 --> 50:43.638
[overlapping chatter]
-He's hyping this up--
-The last one you showed us--

50:43.641 --> 50:44.657
-Look at it.
-[all] Whoa!

50:44.658 --> 50:45.674
[overlapping chatter]
-He's hyping this up--
-The last one you showed us--

50:45.676 --> 50:47.510
[Coombs] Shit!
I gotta get a copy of that.

50:47.511 --> 50:49.345
[overlapping chatter]
-He's hyping this up--
-The last one you showed us--

50:49.347 --> 50:50.730
[Rayburn]
What have you got for me?

50:50.731 --> 50:52.114
[overlapping chatter]
-He's hyping this up--
-The last one you showed us--

50:52.583 --> 50:56.685
They try to hide in this chicken
coop, and then just get iced
by an Apache.

50:56.687 --> 50:58.204
Come on, bro, I got that one
from Travers like two weeks ago.

50:58.205 --> 50:59.722
They try to hide in this chicken
coop, and then just get iced
by an Apache.

50:59.724 --> 51:02.592
[Coombs] Why you gotta hog all
these fucking videos? Let me get
a copy of this.

51:02.593 --> 51:05.461
They try to hide in this chicken
coop, and then just get iced
by an Apache.

51:11.335 --> 51:13.335
Popcorn?

51:13.337 --> 51:14.887
No. No, thanks.

51:14.888 --> 51:16.438
Popcorn?

51:20.812 --> 51:21.644
Alright.

51:21.646 --> 51:23.229
I'll let you get back
to your work.

51:23.230 --> 51:24.813
Alright.

51:24.816 --> 51:25.965
Thanks.

51:25.966 --> 51:27.115
Alright.

51:50.208 --> 51:52.241
Sergeant Deeks?

52:23.474 --> 52:26.242
[Deeks]
Can I help you with that?

52:28.212 --> 52:31.380
Here, grab the other side.

52:35.586 --> 52:38.654
Now you can really
dig in there.

52:39.457 --> 52:42.458
Ever seen one of these before?

52:43.728 --> 52:45.161
Huh?

52:45.163 --> 52:46.963
I saw a guy
get ripped in two once.

52:46.964 --> 52:48.764
Huh?

52:48.766 --> 52:50.232
That was some crazy shit.

52:50.233 --> 52:51.699
Huh?

52:52.403 --> 52:55.804
So what were you doing here,
Briggman?

52:59.577 --> 53:02.444
I know what's going on.

53:02.446 --> 53:02.661
Yeah?

53:02.662 --> 53:02.877
I know what's going on.

53:02.880 --> 53:03.779
[Andrew]
I can't be part of that.

53:03.780 --> 53:04.679
I know what's going on.

53:04.682 --> 53:06.015
What, you think it's wrong?

53:06.016 --> 53:07.349
I know what's going on.

53:07.351 --> 53:07.900
Yeah, I do.

53:07.901 --> 53:08.450
I know what's going on.

53:08.452 --> 53:09.652
You think that man was innocent?

53:09.653 --> 53:10.853
I know what's going on.

53:10.855 --> 53:12.071
He didn't deserve to die.

53:12.072 --> 53:13.288
I know what's going on.

53:13.424 --> 53:15.424
Hmm...

53:15.426 --> 53:15.825
He was unarmed.

53:15.826 --> 53:16.225
Hmm...

53:16.227 --> 53:17.827
Alright, so only if he's holding
an AK, then he...

53:17.828 --> 53:19.428
Hmm...

53:19.430 --> 53:20.980
magically becomes
a bad guy, huh?

53:20.981 --> 53:22.531
Hmm...

53:22.533 --> 53:23.366
They never know where
the IED's are buried,

53:23.367 --> 53:24.200
Hmm...

53:24.202 --> 53:25.585
but they always know
how to avoid them.

53:25.586 --> 53:26.969
Hmm...

53:26.971 --> 53:28.387
What the fuck is that?

53:28.388 --> 53:29.804
Hmm...

53:29.807 --> 53:30.639
Huh?

53:30.640 --> 53:31.472
Hmm...

53:31.475 --> 53:32.575
The will of Allah?

53:32.576 --> 53:33.676
Hmm...

53:33.811 --> 53:37.313
Divine intervention? No.

53:37.315 --> 53:38.281
They're co-operators, Briggman.

53:38.282 --> 53:39.248
Divine intervention? No.

53:39.250 --> 53:40.483
You kill one of theirs,
you save ten of ours.

53:40.484 --> 53:41.717
Divine intervention? No.

53:41.719 --> 53:44.687
And you're telling me
that's not right.

53:44.688 --> 53:47.656
Divine intervention? No.

53:49.594 --> 53:51.527
The Constitution says
you can execute

53:51.529 --> 53:53.446
American citizens for giving
comfort and aid to the enemy.

53:53.447 --> 53:55.364
The Constitution says
you can execute

53:55.366 --> 53:57.316
And these motherfuckers
should get a pass?

53:57.317 --> 53:59.267
The Constitution says
you can execute

53:59.604 --> 54:02.004
Is that what you think?

54:07.445 --> 54:09.378
I'm sorry.

54:15.286 --> 54:17.720
Don't apologize.

54:20.458 --> 54:23.626
[Deeks]
I appreciate your honesty.

54:46.717 --> 54:48.984
[Rayburn]
Yo, wake up, bro.

54:48.986 --> 54:49.952
Briggman?

54:49.953 --> 54:50.919
[Rayburn]
Yo, wake up, bro.

54:53.324 --> 54:55.291
Time to go.

54:58.296 --> 54:58.894
Go where?

54:58.896 --> 55:00.679
Get your ass up and find out.

55:00.680 --> 55:02.463
Go where?

55:03.668 --> 55:05.768
[gunshots]

55:10.374 --> 55:13.475
So how you feelin', Brigsey?

55:16.681 --> 55:18.547
I'm good.

55:18.849 --> 55:21.717
How's everything at home?

55:24.522 --> 55:27.756
Everything's fine, Rayburn.

55:27.758 --> 55:28.741
Good.

55:28.742 --> 55:29.725
Everything's fine, Rayburn.

55:33.664 --> 55:36.565
You talked
to your family lately?

55:40.037 --> 55:41.503
What?

55:41.505 --> 55:42.037
Have you talked to your family?

55:42.038 --> 55:42.570
What?

55:42.573 --> 55:43.989
Why are you asking me
if I've talked to my family?

55:43.990 --> 55:45.406
What?

55:45.409 --> 55:46.242
Why are you asking me that?

55:46.243 --> 55:47.076
What?

55:47.078 --> 55:48.361
-It's what people do, man.
Coombs!
-Yeah?

55:48.362 --> 55:49.645
What?

55:49.647 --> 55:50.546
You've talked to your family
lately, right?

55:50.547 --> 55:51.446
What?

55:51.449 --> 55:52.915
Yeah, I called my mom
yesterday.

55:52.916 --> 55:54.382
What?

55:59.423 --> 56:01.724
You should call them, man.

56:01.726 --> 56:02.792
They worry about you.

56:02.793 --> 56:03.859
You should call them, man.

56:03.861 --> 56:05.211
[Coombs] Yeah, Brigsey.

56:05.212 --> 56:06.562
You should call them, man.

56:06.697 --> 56:09.131
You should give them a call.

56:09.467 --> 56:12.735
You don't want them
to think you're dead.

56:14.071 --> 56:16.605
-[Rayburn] I'm out!
-[Coombs] I'm out too.

56:16.607 --> 56:18.023
[Rayburn]
Hold your fire!

56:18.024 --> 56:19.440
-[Rayburn] I'm out!
-[Coombs] I'm out too.

56:27.985 --> 56:30.018
-Hey, Brigsey.
-Yeah?

56:30.020 --> 56:31.954
Do me a favor,
go get the targets.

56:31.955 --> 56:33.889
-Hey, Brigsey.
-Yeah?

56:36.427 --> 56:38.794
-Me?
-Yeah.

56:39.430 --> 56:41.964
Go get the targets.

56:45.169 --> 56:48.036
[laughs]

56:48.873 --> 56:50.739
Go on.

56:53.511 --> 56:55.444
Why?

56:56.614 --> 56:59.581
You think we're gonna
shoot you or some shit?

56:59.583 --> 57:00.716
[laughs]

57:00.717 --> 57:01.850
You think we're gonna
shoot you or some shit?

57:01.852 --> 57:03.018
Come on, go get the targets.

57:03.019 --> 57:04.185
You think we're gonna
shoot you or some shit?

57:04.188 --> 57:05.638
Come on, Brigsey, go get 'em.

57:05.639 --> 57:07.089
You think we're gonna
shoot you or some shit?

57:11.061 --> 57:13.762
Fuckin' pussy.

58:18.462 --> 58:20.062
My bad.

58:21.665 --> 58:25.567
-That's not fucking funny!
-[all laugh]

58:25.569 --> 58:26.652
That's not funny!

58:26.653 --> 58:27.736
-That's not fucking funny!
-[all laugh]

58:28.072 --> 58:31.940
Let's keep the line moving
before these little fuckers
get burned.

58:31.942 --> 58:33.358
[Coombs]
Alright, Sergeant Deeks.

58:33.359 --> 58:34.775
Let's keep the line moving
before these little fuckers
get burned.

58:34.778 --> 58:35.828
[Deeks] <i> Bon appetit.</i>

58:35.829 --> 58:36.879
Let's keep the line moving
before these little fuckers
get burned.

58:41.519 --> 58:44.920
-Thank you, Sergeant.
-Enjoy.

58:44.922 --> 58:45.988
[Deeks] Next!

58:45.989 --> 58:47.055
-Thank you, Sergeant.
-Enjoy.

58:47.725 --> 58:51.827
-Here you go, Rayburn, enjoy.
-Sergeant Deeks.

59:25.229 --> 59:26.094
Shit!

59:26.096 --> 59:27.095
[Rayburn]
You're a dead man, Brigsey.

59:27.096 --> 59:28.095
Shit!

59:28.098 --> 59:29.615
[Rayburn]
Come here, asshole! Fuckin' rat!

59:29.616 --> 59:31.133
Shit!

59:31.135 --> 59:32.585
-[Coombs] I got you, snitch!
-[Weppler] Fucking snitch!

59:32.586 --> 59:34.036
Shit!

59:34.038 --> 59:35.437
[Andrew]
Get the fuck off me!

59:35.438 --> 59:36.837
Shit!

59:39.209 --> 59:42.311
[panting]

59:43.781 --> 59:45.881
[Deeks] Kaden.

59:46.884 --> 59:47.916
[Andrew] Shit.

59:47.918 --> 59:49.351
That's my little boy.

59:49.352 --> 59:50.785
[Andrew] Shit.

59:51.255 --> 59:53.722
He does this thing
where he holds his breath

59:53.724 --> 59:55.391
until his face
turns completely red.

59:55.392 --> 59:57.059
He does this thing
where he holds his breath

59:57.895 --> 01:00:00.362
And it fucking gets me
every time.

01:00:00.364 --> 01:00:02.247
-What are you doing here?
-He's always asking what I do.

01:00:02.248 --> 01:00:04.131
And it fucking gets me
every time.

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:05.667
"Daddy, what's your work?"

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:07.201
And it fucking gets me
every time.

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:13.375
What do you tell him?

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:16.845
That I'm helping people.

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:22.150
He's only seven.

01:00:22.686 --> 01:00:25.821
But when he gets older
I'll be proud...

01:00:25.823 --> 01:00:27.556
to tell him
that I was a warrior.

01:00:27.557 --> 01:00:29.290
But when he gets older
I'll be proud...

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.328
That my job was to kill...

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.113
and I was damned good
at my job.

01:00:35.114 --> 01:00:36.897
That my job was to kill...

01:00:37.368 --> 01:00:41.670
Are you proud
of what you're doing out here?

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:47.075
[sighs] I don't...

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:48.443
[Deeks] No, I get it.

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:49.810
[sighs] I don't...

01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:52.347
You're trying to do
what you think is right.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:53.298
And I respect that,
I really do.

01:00:53.299 --> 01:00:54.248
You're trying to do
what you think is right.

01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:57.619
The problem is you don't even
know what right means yet.

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:00.988
You're trying to do
what you think is right.

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:07.696
And you're going to rain some
ruinous shit down on a lot of
good people.

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:10.932
Including me.

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.703
And I can't allow that.

01:01:15.439 --> 01:01:18.040
I have a son, Briggman.

01:01:20.244 --> 01:01:22.911
You understand?

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:27.849
Good.

01:01:28.986 --> 01:01:33.088
Now, unfortunately, I'm going
to have to threaten you.

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:39.761
Yeah. Sorry.

01:01:39.763 --> 01:01:41.096
I really don't want to do this.

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.430
Yeah. Sorry.

01:01:44.268 --> 01:01:46.468
But it's necessary.

01:01:47.071 --> 01:01:49.738
For both our sakes.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:23.972
Every time you get the urge
to open your mouth,

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:26.124
I want you to think
of these little Muj fingers.

01:02:26.125 --> 01:02:28.275
Every time you get the urge
to open your mouth,

01:02:32.382 --> 01:02:34.282
Hey...

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.788
I'm sorry it's come to this.

01:02:44.061 --> 01:02:46.128

Yes, yes, he's my son.
Is he okay?

01:16:05.895 --> 01:16:06.277
No, no...

01:16:06.278 --> 01:16:06.660
Open up!

01:16:06.663 --> 01:16:08.696
Listen to me,
there's been a mistake, you...

01:16:08.697 --> 01:16:10.730
Open up!

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:12.967
That's not right.

01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:16.237
[MP] Hey! Open the door!

01:17:25.708 --> 01:17:27.942
What's up, Brigsey?

01:17:28.411 --> 01:17:29.043
Hey...

01:17:29.045 --> 01:17:31.379
They're sayin' I'm a murderer.
Believe that?

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.714
Hey...

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:37.218
You don't think that, right?

01:18:45.722 --> 01:18:48.255
Lighten up, dude.

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:52.159
They won't find shit.

01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:54.995
I got rid of everything.

01:18:57.133 --> 01:19:00.267
You know, I've done this
a thousand times.

01:19:00.269 --> 01:19:02.636
Just stick to the story
and we're good.

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:05.004
You know, I've done this
a thousand times.

01:19:09.846 --> 01:19:14.014
You don't think I know exactly
how to play this game?

01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:19.120
You don't think I'm ten moves
ahead of these fucking clowns?

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:23.057
We are good.

01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:30.297
-Briggman.
-I heard you.

01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:41.509
I don't know
what they told you,

01:19:42.044 --> 01:19:46.814
but whatever they promised
is a lie.

01:19:49.385 --> 01:19:53.354
I will protect you.
I promise you.

01:19:53.890 --> 01:19:55.956
Fucking say something!

01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:59.493

Hey, bud.

We got you,
it's going to be okay.

01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:40.867
Hey, bud.

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:42.019
It's going to be okay.

01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:43.169
Hey, bud.

01:20:48.911 --> 01:20:51.445
Okay...

01:20:51.581 --> 01:20:54.348
Andrew, I need you

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:56.117
to tell me everything
that happened.

01:20:56.118 --> 01:20:57.885
Andrew, I need you

01:20:57.887 --> 01:20:59.053
Everything you remember.

01:20:59.054 --> 01:21:00.220
Andrew, I need you

01:21:00.223 --> 01:21:01.672
Just take it from the top, okay?

01:21:01.673 --> 01:21:03.122
Andrew, I need you

01:21:14.503 --> 01:21:15.135
Dad...

01:21:15.137 --> 01:21:17.087
[William] It's going to be fine.
You tried to stop those guys.

01:21:17.088 --> 01:21:19.038
Dad...

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:20.107
Then they arrest you?

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:21.174
Dad...

01:21:22.345 --> 01:21:25.045
You're a criminal?

01:21:25.948 --> 01:21:28.182
[William]
You're the hero here.

01:21:28.184 --> 01:21:29.584
[Mrs. Briggman]
It's okay.

01:21:29.585 --> 01:21:30.985
[William]
You're the hero here.

01:21:32.889 --> 01:21:35.990
[William]
Tell him what happened.

01:21:40.096 --> 01:21:42.663
You didn't kill anybody.

01:21:42.999 --> 01:21:45.666
[Mrs. Briggman]
Please.

01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:49.670
I don't understand.

01:21:51.641 --> 01:21:54.041
[William] Andy?
