00:03.230 --> 00:05.629
Your father is gravely ill in Moscow.

00:05.630 --> 00:09.069
You are Count Bezukhov
now, my dear friend!

00:09.070 --> 00:12.549
'You're the most brilliant man
I know! You could do anything!'

00:12.550 --> 00:15.389
He's going off to the war and
sending me away to the country

00:15.390 --> 00:16.435
to have my baby all alone.

00:16.483 --> 00:17.923
No, please!!

00:18.883 --> 00:21.403
I just wanted to come and
see Natasha on her name day.

00:23.683 --> 00:26.683
I know I'm just the poor
relation and your mother

00:26.684 --> 00:29.682
- would never let him marry me.
- Anything's possible.

00:29.683 --> 00:31.002
And he does love you, I know it.

00:31.003 --> 00:33.482
Russia hasn't lost a war in 100 years.

00:33.483 --> 00:36.642
This monster, Bonaparte,
he's crossed into Austria now

00:36.643 --> 00:38.762
and who's to say that
Russia won't be next?

00:38.763 --> 00:42.082
- Don't put yourself in danger!
- Mamma, please don't fuss. I am a man now.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.962
I request permission to join
Prince Bagration in this action.

00:44.963 --> 00:47.643
If one quarter of them come
back tomorrow, I'll thank God.

00:53.523 --> 00:54.802
Has Papa spoken to you?

00:54.803 --> 00:55.882
What about?

00:55.883 --> 00:57.242
He wants to marry us both off.

00:57.243 --> 01:01.882
Pierre, Helene... congratulations!

01:01.883 --> 01:03.923
- What's happened?
- We're engaged!

02:44.003 --> 02:46.562
I have to tell you that the
Minister of War is very busy

02:46.563 --> 02:48.402
and may not be able to
see you this evening.

02:48.403 --> 02:49.842
It's imperative that he does.

02:49.843 --> 02:51.722
I've come directly from the battlefield.

02:51.723 --> 02:54.162
My orders were to report to
the Austrian Emperor himself.

02:54.163 --> 02:56.642
No, no, this is not how we do
things here, your Excellency.

02:56.643 --> 02:59.043
I'll have to have a
word with the Minister.

03:00.723 --> 03:02.362
He's asked to see the Emperor.

03:08.283 --> 03:11.043
He will see you now. Please, come in.

03:26.123 --> 03:30.002
So? You are from General Kutuzov?
And the reason for your visit?

03:30.003 --> 03:33.922
To report the success of
the action at Schongrabern.

03:33.923 --> 03:35.163
Here is the dispatch.

03:37.723 --> 03:40.242
You call it a success, do you?

03:40.243 --> 03:43.642
It seems of little consequence,
now the French have taken Vienna.

03:43.643 --> 03:47.482
Coming after the defeat of
the Austrian army at Ulm, yes,

03:47.483 --> 03:49.083
it was a success.

03:50.163 --> 03:54.242
The French advance was stopped long
enough to allow our armies to regroup.

03:54.243 --> 03:57.962
But there were terrible
casualties on our side, too.

03:57.963 --> 03:59.922
We await Napoleon's next move.

03:59.923 --> 04:04.803
Well, this is a war, you know.
One must expect some bloodshed.

04:06.963 --> 04:08.842
General Kutuzov thought that

04:08.843 --> 04:11.443
you'd like to hear some
good news, for a change.

04:12.683 --> 04:16.122
Thank you. His Majesty will be informed.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.843
And now, if you would
excuse me, I have work to do.

04:20.163 --> 04:21.803
Or was there something else?

04:58.043 --> 04:59.443
What are you looking at?

05:01.603 --> 05:06.922
My lovely wife! I was just
thinking what a treasure I have.

05:06.923 --> 05:08.562
Am I a treasure, then?

05:08.563 --> 05:14.202
Oh, Lord, you are. You are
an inexhaustible treasure.

05:14.203 --> 05:17.922
Full of wonderful, wonderful
secrets and delights.

05:17.923 --> 05:23.082
The more I discover, the more it
seems is left to be discovered.

05:23.083 --> 05:26.402
More secrets, more delights... 
does that make sense?

05:26.403 --> 05:27.962
Mmm.

05:27.963 --> 05:31.882
Actually, I don't think
I am inexhaustible.

05:31.883 --> 05:34.482
One can get a bit tired of
having one's secrets and delights

05:34.483 --> 05:36.762
discovered all the time, over and over.

05:36.825 --> 05:40.504
My love, forgive me. What
an inconsiderate brute I am.

05:40.505 --> 05:42.065
You're not so bad.

05:43.985 --> 05:47.384
But there are more things
to life, aren't there?

05:47.385 --> 05:50.104
You are Count Bezukhov, after all.

05:50.105 --> 05:52.104
Yes, I have been thinking about that.

05:52.105 --> 05:53.865
And taking advice and so on.

05:55.465 --> 05:58.624
I think one of the first things
we should do is make a tour

05:58.625 --> 06:00.904
of all my estates in the country.

06:00.905 --> 06:02.545
Well...

06:04.145 --> 06:06.224
The thing is...

06:06.225 --> 06:09.544
I'm not really awfully good at
coping with peasants and farms

06:09.545 --> 06:12.144
and all that country
life, sort of thing.

06:12.145 --> 06:14.705
And I have rather a lot
of engagements in the city.

06:16.225 --> 06:19.224
I think it would be better
if you went on your own.

06:19.225 --> 06:21.384
I'd only be a distraction, anyway.

06:21.385 --> 06:23.744
Yes, but a wonderful,
wonderful distraction...

06:23.745 --> 06:26.544
No, I think you should
start as you mean to go on.

06:26.545 --> 06:27.865
Duty before pleasure.

06:30.505 --> 06:33.905
Don't you think it'll do us good
to spend a little time apart?

06:35.865 --> 06:37.864
If you say so.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.664
Don't they say that absence
sharpens the appetite?

06:40.665 --> 06:43.184
Mine doesn't really need
any sharpening, Helene.

06:43.185 --> 06:45.825
You are a wicked, wicked man!

07:19.705 --> 07:21.345
What is it, Papa?

07:22.345 --> 07:23.504
Is it from Nikolai?

07:23.505 --> 07:25.824
Yes, dear Nikki...

07:25.825 --> 07:27.544
He...

07:27.545 --> 07:30.704
He was wounded, but it's
all better now, he says.

07:30.705 --> 07:33.064
And he's been promoted!

07:33.065 --> 07:34.224
He's an officer now!

07:34.225 --> 07:35.864
An officer of the line!

07:35.865 --> 07:38.225
My little Nikki, an officer!

07:39.345 --> 07:41.104
But wounded!

07:41.105 --> 07:44.504
I know... What will I tell your mother?

07:44.505 --> 07:46.664
Tell her about the promotion first.

07:46.665 --> 07:48.464
Yes... Yes.

07:48.465 --> 07:50.224
And he's really quite recovered?

07:50.225 --> 07:51.544
So he writes.

07:51.545 --> 07:52.984
Oh, thank God!

07:54.465 --> 07:57.784
He says he's short of
money. That's our Nikki!

07:57.785 --> 07:59.504
I'll send him some.

07:59.505 --> 08:02.224
Nikolai was wounded in
battle, but it's all right

08:02.225 --> 08:03.624
and he's been promoted!

08:03.625 --> 08:04.825
Hurrah!

08:06.225 --> 08:07.824
Did he kill many Frenchmen?

08:07.825 --> 08:10.064
I don't know. Papa didn't say.

08:10.065 --> 08:13.464
If I were him, I'd have
killed hundreds of them!

08:13.465 --> 08:14.945
Petya! Petya!

08:20.905 --> 08:22.665
You knew, didn't you?

08:23.625 --> 08:26.425
- Yes.
- He writes to you?

08:28.225 --> 08:30.585
He must really be in love with you.

08:52.505 --> 08:53.665
I have to go.

08:57.105 --> 09:00.544
What time is it? Parade's not till noon.

09:00.545 --> 09:04.624
No, I've got an appointment.
My cousin, Boris Drubetskoy,

09:04.625 --> 09:05.784
he's in the Guards.

09:05.785 --> 09:07.185
Oh, very grand!

09:13.385 --> 09:16.545
Can you take care of the bill for...

09:18.025 --> 09:20.141
- I'll pay you back!
- Off you go, my boy.

09:20.181 --> 09:21.704
Think nothing of it!

09:25.625 --> 09:28.825
Come on... Come in with me and get warm!

09:30.225 --> 09:31.385
Move up.

09:52.465 --> 09:55.665
Rostov! I didn't expect you so soon!

09:57.945 --> 10:00.304
Sorry, you know Captain
Berg? He's in our company.

10:00.305 --> 10:01.744
Happy to make your acquaintance.

10:01.745 --> 10:06.944
Well. You look... I don't know... 
you look like a real cavalryman now.

10:06.945 --> 10:09.544
And you look like the
cat that's got the cream.

10:09.545 --> 10:11.744
You Guards get the best
of everything, don't you?

10:11.745 --> 10:16.984
We do, we do... the receptions,
the dinners, the balls...

10:16.985 --> 10:21.305
but you've been in action. Come
and sit and tell us all about it.

10:22.345 --> 10:25.744
You were at Schongrabern? That
must have been some affair!

10:25.745 --> 10:30.184
Yes. We, um, we were cut off,

10:30.185 --> 10:34.344
so there was nothing for it but
to charge, head-on, sabres drawn.

10:34.345 --> 10:37.064
There's no feeling like it,
Boris. Nothing in the world.

10:37.065 --> 10:41.944
You have bullets flying around your
ears and you feel no fear, at all,

10:41.945 --> 10:45.624
just a strange mixture
of joy and fury...

10:45.625 --> 10:48.824
Don't get up. Please don't
let me interrupt you, sir.

10:48.825 --> 10:52.224
Count Nikolai Rostov,
Prince Andrei Bolkonsky.

10:52.225 --> 10:53.464
Please go on.

10:53.465 --> 10:56.784
You were in the cavalry charge
in Schongrabern, you say?

10:56.785 --> 10:58.584
Yes, I was there.

10:58.585 --> 11:01.504
Yes. There are many
stories told of that action.

11:01.505 --> 11:05.224
Perhaps, but the stories told by
the men who were actually there,

11:05.225 --> 11:07.104
under enemy fire, in the thick of it,

11:07.105 --> 11:11.224
are a different thing to the
stories told by fellows on the staff,

11:11.225 --> 11:13.384
who get rewards for doing nothing.

11:13.385 --> 11:15.744
And you consider me
one of those, do you?

11:15.745 --> 11:17.424
I'm not talking about you!

11:17.425 --> 11:20.344
I don't know you and I don't wish to.

11:20.345 --> 11:22.345
I speak of the staff in general!

11:24.865 --> 11:26.824
Let me tell you this...

11:26.825 --> 11:30.345
You wish to insult me? I'd
be glad to teach you a lesson.

11:31.665 --> 11:34.104
But this is hardly the time
or the place for duelling.

11:34.105 --> 11:37.264
Very soon, we shall all be
engaged in something much greater

11:37.265 --> 11:39.465
and more terrible than Schongrabern.

11:41.705 --> 11:44.025
You save your valour
for that, Count Rostov.

11:45.025 --> 11:49.305
I won't stay. We can settle
our business tomorrow.

11:50.305 --> 11:51.385
I wish you all good day.

11:54.305 --> 11:55.345
Damn him.

11:56.945 --> 12:00.421
- He as good as called me a liar!
- Come, come. Drink up.

12:00.530 --> 12:03.425
Some of us know a hero when we meet one.

12:08.905 --> 12:12.264
"To Prince Nikolai Andreyich Bolkonsky.

12:12.265 --> 12:15.504
My dear Prince, I shall shortly
be in your neighbourhood.

12:15.505 --> 12:20.224
I am going to an inspection and my
son Anatole is keeping me company

12:20.225 --> 12:23.904
on his way to the army. I hope
you will allow me to introduce him

12:23.905 --> 12:27.784
to you and to your daughter,
the Princess Marya."

12:27.785 --> 12:29.225
Damned impudence!

12:44.505 --> 12:46.264
Papa, is she really very ugly?

12:46.265 --> 12:49.664
No, of course not! She's said
to be a little on the plain side,

12:49.665 --> 12:52.064
but perfectly acceptable.

12:52.065 --> 12:55.224
More to the point, she
has impeccable breeding

12:55.225 --> 12:57.704
and she'll bring a considerable
fortune to the marriage.

12:57.705 --> 13:00.224
I need you to be on
your very best behaviour

13:00.225 --> 13:03.625
and to treat the Princess and her
father with the utmost respect.

13:04.745 --> 13:07.024
- Understood?
- Yes, Papa.

13:07.025 --> 13:10.424
This is an innocent girl who
knows nothing of the world.

13:10.425 --> 13:13.145
You must appear to her as
utterly pure and honourable.

13:14.305 --> 13:16.385
I AM utterly pure and honourable.

13:18.105 --> 13:21.024
I've never cared for Vassily Kuragin.

13:21.025 --> 13:22.825
He's a schemer and a ladies' man.

13:23.945 --> 13:26.465
No doubt his son's the same... or worse!

13:27.785 --> 13:30.544
Of course, they're after
Marya for her money!

13:30.545 --> 13:33.264
Well, no-one's going to
take her for her looks!

13:34.465 --> 13:35.704
What?

13:35.705 --> 13:37.384
Nothing, your Excellency.

13:37.385 --> 13:38.425
What, I say?

13:39.745 --> 13:43.904
Begging your pardon, Excellency.
I don't think you want to lose her.

13:43.905 --> 13:44.944
What?!

13:44.945 --> 13:48.104
Don't you presume to tell
me what I want or don't want!

13:48.105 --> 13:50.464
She can marry if she likes!

13:50.465 --> 13:53.184
Though she'll be unhappy, if she does.

13:53.185 --> 13:55.384
There's no need for girls
to marry. No need at all.

13:55.385 --> 13:57.304
They'd be much better
off staying at home.

13:57.305 --> 14:00.864
It's a bad business, Tikhon!

14:00.865 --> 14:03.305
Well, better get it over with.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.424
What do you think?

14:06.425 --> 14:09.224
Perhaps with her hair
done up high like this?

14:09.225 --> 14:13.864
Oui, peut-être... Ooh, and with
a silk ribbon to tie it up...

14:13.865 --> 14:17.064
Katya! Go and fetch us a
ribbon to match with the dress!

14:17.065 --> 14:21.465
Courage! We are going to make
you look fit for a prince!

14:23.145 --> 14:26.464
You know you have to make
a little effort, dear Marya.

14:26.465 --> 14:28.584
Everybody does at these times.

14:28.585 --> 14:31.464
What you do now could
change your whole life!

14:31.465 --> 14:34.144
And try to smile, just a little bit!

14:34.145 --> 14:35.664
This is your big day!

14:35.665 --> 14:38.264
Ah, yes! That will look so sweet!

14:38.265 --> 14:39.305
Now, let's see...

14:40.625 --> 14:43.065
Oui, comme ça ! Voilà.

14:49.025 --> 14:50.065
C'est...

14:51.025 --> 14:52.185
... charmant.

14:57.825 --> 15:00.345
Ah! Ah! Here she is!

15:03.065 --> 15:04.425
Well, come in, girl!

15:09.345 --> 15:11.824
Do you remember me at all, Princess?

15:11.825 --> 15:14.185
Yes, very well, Prince Vassily.

15:15.305 --> 15:17.265
This is my son, Anatole.

15:22.865 --> 15:26.464
So, you've tarted yourself
up for our guests, have you?

15:26.465 --> 15:28.064
Very fine, very fine!

15:28.065 --> 15:31.224
You put your hair up in that
stupid fashion for our guests,

15:31.225 --> 15:35.584
but I say to you, in front of
our guests, I don't care for it!

15:35.585 --> 15:37.984
Mon pere, you mustn't blame
her. It was all my doing!

15:37.985 --> 15:40.304
Well, there was no reason
to make herself look ugly.

15:40.305 --> 15:43.384
She's plain enough as it is!
On the contrary, this hairstyle

15:43.385 --> 15:45.504
is most becoming to the Princess.

15:45.505 --> 15:47.401
Indeed, quite... charming.

15:47.644 --> 15:50.924
Nonsense. So, you're off to
war, are you? Horse Guards?

15:50.980 --> 15:53.081
No, sir, I've been
transferred to the Infantry.

15:53.106 --> 15:54.219
Excellent. Very good.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.391
To serve your Tsar and
country. What regiment?

15:56.860 --> 16:00.063
Ah, I'm enlisted in...

16:00.580 --> 16:02.380
What am I enlisted in, Papa?

16:03.460 --> 16:05.739
"What am I enlisted in?"!

16:05.740 --> 16:07.499
Ha! A fine warrior!

16:07.500 --> 16:09.619
Doesn't know his own regiment!

16:09.620 --> 16:11.939
I know, I know, it's a scandal.

16:11.940 --> 16:16.739
- You're more for the ladies, I take it.
- I suppose I am, sir.

16:16.740 --> 16:19.299
Yes, well, I'll leave you to it.

16:19.300 --> 16:20.980
Impudent puppy.

16:32.823 --> 16:36.019
Quite shy-making, all this, isn't it?

16:36.020 --> 16:37.899
But you're not shy.

16:37.900 --> 16:42.099
Indeed I am. I'm petrified of
your father. He's so fierce.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.940
He has a quick temper.

16:45.540 --> 16:47.219
Does he beat you?

16:47.220 --> 16:48.699
No!

16:48.700 --> 16:51.140
Well, that's... something, isn't it?

16:53.900 --> 16:55.500
Does your father beat you?

16:57.900 --> 16:59.660
Only when I've been very naughty.

17:03.540 --> 17:05.618
I don't believe you!

18:16.180 --> 18:20.259
You must know what it is I am
hoping for, my dear friend...

18:20.260 --> 18:25.499
an alliance between our families.
My son and your lovely daughter...

18:25.500 --> 18:27.339
Pish!

18:27.340 --> 18:32.099
But I know how dear
the Princess is to you.

18:32.100 --> 18:34.779
I could understand if you
couldn't bear to part with her...

18:34.780 --> 18:37.379
Part with her? She can marry tomorrow!

18:37.380 --> 18:40.219
But I won't have her taken advantage of!

18:40.220 --> 18:42.859
You know my rules... 
everything in the open!

18:42.860 --> 18:45.779
I'll ask her tomorrow, in your presence.

18:45.780 --> 18:48.100
If she wants him, let him
stay a while, and I'll see.

18:51.199 --> 18:54.900
I'll be frank with you. I know
you see straight through people.

18:57.340 --> 19:00.940
Anatole's not the brightest
button in the box...

19:02.180 --> 19:05.700
... but he's a good boy,
an excellent son and...

19:06.860 --> 19:09.699
.. he's one of us, you know.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.195
I said I'll see, didn't I?

19:11.220 --> 19:13.660
Let her marry him if she
wants. It's all the same to me.

19:15.496 --> 19:17.776
Very good. I'm most grateful.

19:25.736 --> 19:27.056
Goodnight, Princess.

19:34.246 --> 19:35.766
Mademoiselle Bourienne.

19:36.726 --> 19:37.926
When?

19:41.366 --> 19:43.285
No!

19:43.286 --> 19:44.925
When I've heard from your father

19:44.926 --> 19:46.885
that you've learnt to behave yourself,

19:46.886 --> 19:48.605
then I'll give you my hand to kiss!

19:48.606 --> 19:51.326
Well, then, I shall wish
you ladies goodnight.

20:03.566 --> 20:04.606
How did it go?

20:06.526 --> 20:10.485
She's damnably dull looking,
isn't she, poor little thing!

20:10.486 --> 20:11.965
But did she like you?

20:11.966 --> 20:13.245
Oh, yes, I think so.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.045
And could you put up
with her, do you think?

20:15.046 --> 20:18.005
To please you, Papa? Yes, I could.

20:18.006 --> 20:21.206
After all, we wouldn't
always be together.

20:22.526 --> 20:26.766
She'd be off praying and
doing good works, I imagine.

20:28.566 --> 20:30.925
The other one, though,
that French one...

20:30.926 --> 20:32.085
Don't you dare!

20:32.086 --> 20:35.445
No, no, of course not.

20:35.446 --> 20:36.526
I was just saying.

20:38.646 --> 20:40.445
How was it with the old man?

20:40.446 --> 20:45.206
Hard going. But he wants
the best for his daughter.

20:47.366 --> 20:48.566
And she wants me.

20:55.886 --> 20:57.725
Oh, blessed Jesus.

20:57.726 --> 21:00.045
Is it wrong to think a man so beautiful,

21:00.046 --> 21:02.766
to... long for him to touch me?

21:05.326 --> 21:08.365
Though I fear it, tell me if
that is what you want for me,

21:08.366 --> 21:11.006
let me simply be the
instrument of your will.

21:17.766 --> 21:19.286
Come in, come in, sit down.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.846
Something to say to you.

21:23.446 --> 21:29.165
Now, Miss, a proposal has been
made to me, concerning you.

21:29.166 --> 21:33.645
And since you know my rules,
I'm referring it to you.

21:33.646 --> 21:36.285
How might I understand you, Papa?

21:36.286 --> 21:38.565
What I mean is,

21:38.566 --> 21:42.245
Prince Vassily finds you to
his taste as a daughter-in-law,

21:42.246 --> 21:46.766
so he's proposing to you, on behalf
of his son. What do you say to that?

21:48.446 --> 21:51.605
Oh... I don't know what to say.

21:51.606 --> 21:52.965
What do you think about it?

21:52.966 --> 21:56.165
What do I think about it?
It's nothing to do with me!

21:56.166 --> 21:57.365
No-one's proposing to me!

21:57.366 --> 21:59.606
It's what you think,
Miss, that's the issue!

22:01.074 --> 22:03.526
But I only want what
you want for me, Father.

22:05.051 --> 22:07.770
But if you ask me, I do like him.

22:07.771 --> 22:09.531
Oh, splendid!

22:10.731 --> 22:12.330
So, he'll get you and your dowry

22:12.331 --> 22:15.811
and he'll take her as well. You'll
be the wife and she'll be the...

22:18.571 --> 22:20.650
Come, come, I'm only joking.

22:20.651 --> 22:23.570
Perhaps you should go to
your room and think it over.

22:23.571 --> 22:27.770
And in an hour, come to the
drawing room and say yes or no.

22:27.771 --> 22:29.491
Yes or no, do you understand?

22:30.799 --> 22:32.199
All right. Off with you!

22:35.811 --> 22:37.091
Go on, off with you!

23:19.491 --> 23:21.450
Oh!

23:21.451 --> 23:24.331
Ah! Princess! It's not what you think!

23:36.891 --> 23:40.331
Ah, here she is! Come in, girl.

23:48.811 --> 23:51.730
My dear little Princess Marya,

23:51.731 --> 23:55.170
I have always loved you
like my own daughter.

23:55.171 --> 23:59.650
And now, the fate of
my son is in your hands.

23:59.651 --> 24:00.730
There, you see.

24:00.731 --> 24:04.210
The Prince is proposing to
you, on behalf of his son.

24:04.211 --> 24:07.530
So, I ask you, do you or do you not

24:07.531 --> 24:10.610
want to be the wife of
Prince Anatole Kuragin?

24:10.611 --> 24:15.610
Answer yes or no and I retain my
right to express my opinion as well.

24:15.611 --> 24:16.971
So, what is it, yes or no?

24:19.251 --> 24:22.050
Father, my wish is never to leave you.

24:22.051 --> 24:23.651
I don't want to marry at all.

24:25.838 --> 24:29.157
What nonsense is this? Come here, girl!

24:29.158 --> 24:30.837
There, there!

24:30.838 --> 24:35.117
My dear Princess, this is a
moment I shall never forget.

24:35.118 --> 24:38.157
Will you not give me a little
hope of touching so great,

24:38.158 --> 24:40.117
so generous a heart?

24:40.118 --> 24:42.357
Say that, perhaps...

24:42.358 --> 24:46.162
the future is so large... Say, perhaps?

24:47.078 --> 24:50.957
Princess Marya, I do hope I
haven't offended you in any way?

24:50.958 --> 24:53.477
May I not return and try again?

24:53.478 --> 24:56.244
Prince Vassily, er...

24:56.718 --> 24:59.077
I have said all that I feel in my heart.

24:59.078 --> 25:01.878
I thank you for the honour, but
I shall never be your son's wife.

25:03.278 --> 25:05.677
Yes, well, that's the end of that, then!

25:05.678 --> 25:07.797
Very good to see you,
Kuragin, and your boy

25:07.798 --> 25:09.877
and I wish you both a safe journey.

25:09.878 --> 25:12.077
Marya, go to your room. All done.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.997
Very, very glad to see you, old
friend, and no hard feelings.

25:14.998 --> 25:17.157
All done! Ha! Very good!

25:17.158 --> 25:19.998
Well, that's done. Excellent! Very good.

25:36.798 --> 25:37.838
Is it really him?

25:39.198 --> 25:42.077
Hurrah for the Tsar! Hurrah!

25:42.078 --> 25:43.197
Hurrah!

25:46.478 --> 25:51.662
Fine men. Makes my heart
glad to see their eager faces.

25:52.278 --> 25:55.037
I think we should have
a great victory tomorrow.

25:55.038 --> 25:57.957
With respect, your Majesty, we
should not engage with Napoleon

25:57.958 --> 26:00.917
at all tomorrow, or any time soon.

26:00.918 --> 26:04.277
Bonaparte has withdrawn his
troops. He's asked for talks.

26:04.278 --> 26:07.357
He's desperate to avoid a battle.
All my generals are in agreement

26:07.358 --> 26:08.437
except for you.

26:08.438 --> 26:12.158
Again, with respect, your Majesty,
that doesn't make them right.

26:13.958 --> 26:15.997
And what would you do?

26:15.998 --> 26:17.277
Retreat.

26:17.278 --> 26:19.917
Retreat! I never hear
anything else from you.

26:19.918 --> 26:22.197
Any more retreat would be humiliation.

26:22.198 --> 26:26.197
I think you may be getting
too old for this game, Kutuzov.

26:26.198 --> 26:27.677
My mind is made up.

26:27.678 --> 26:29.798
We'll engage with him
here... and defeat him!

26:34.678 --> 26:36.198
The die is cast.

26:37.918 --> 26:40.117
What do you think will
happen tomorrow, your Grace?

26:40.118 --> 26:43.524
I think we will lose this battle
and a great many men will die.

26:44.718 --> 26:46.637
You're a married man, Bolkonsky?

26:46.638 --> 26:49.557
Yes, my Lise is with child.

26:49.558 --> 26:50.677
Ah.

26:50.678 --> 26:53.078
I should have better
kept in touch with her.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.318
I haven't been a very
affectionate husband.

26:57.798 --> 26:59.238
But no use saying that now.

27:01.158 --> 27:03.877
Write to her before you
sleep tonight, my boy.

27:03.878 --> 27:05.878
It might be the last chance you get.

27:11.318 --> 27:13.156
"My dearest Lise.

27:14.278 --> 27:17.397
Forgive me for not
having written before.

27:17.398 --> 27:20.157
I have been a neglectful husband.

27:20.158 --> 27:24.656
But now I think of you with
nothing but tenderness and remorse.

27:26.558 --> 27:30.918
Marya, I wear your icon and think
of you every day, my dear sister.

27:32.878 --> 27:34.278
Papa... "

27:39.478 --> 27:42.238
And yet, I give them all
up for one moment of glory.

28:10.278 --> 28:11.398
Sire.

28:22.358 --> 28:24.117
Madness.

28:24.118 --> 28:25.837
Do we join the attack, your Grace?

28:25.838 --> 28:28.699
- Hold your ground!
- But the orders are

28:28.700 --> 28:30.917
to advance and engage the enemy
on their right flank, your Grace!

28:30.918 --> 28:34.437
- Do you take your orders from me or not?
- Of course, your Grace.

28:34.438 --> 28:37.918
Then, hold your ground! At least
we won't make fools of ourselves.

28:39.358 --> 28:42.518
To hold this hill is
vital. Let them come to us.

28:44.958 --> 28:46.637
Sir.

28:46.638 --> 28:49.820
Ah... our glorious leader.

28:49.958 --> 28:51.397
Your Majesty.

28:51.398 --> 28:54.335
Kutuzov! Why have you not advanced?

28:54.336 --> 28:57.030
Because that's what Napoleon
wants us to do, your Majesty.

28:57.031 --> 28:59.038
But you understand the
disposition, do you not?

28:59.039 --> 29:03.104
Perfectly, your Majesty. However,
if you order me to advance...

29:03.105 --> 29:06.078
I do! Kindly give the order!

29:12.998 --> 29:14.875
Forward!

29:28.758 --> 29:29.798
Excellent.

29:39.398 --> 29:41.077
I can't see a thing.

29:41.078 --> 29:42.357
Where are we?

29:42.358 --> 29:46.037
More to the point, where are the French?

29:50.438 --> 29:52.125
Sir, look there.

30:09.838 --> 30:11.358
Even worse than I thought.

30:18.758 --> 30:20.558
Forward, at the double!

30:44.918 --> 30:49.237
Rostov, ride over to Kutuzov. Are
we to advance or stand our ground?

30:49.238 --> 30:51.478
Well, go on, man! Quick as you like!

31:04.798 --> 31:07.478
It's all up, lads. Run for it!

31:18.118 --> 31:19.437
Stop those men!

31:19.438 --> 31:22.634
My God, Bolkonsky, what a shambles!

31:33.118 --> 31:36.600
Forward, lads! Hurrah!

32:12.238 --> 32:14.557
Where's General Kutuzov?

32:14.558 --> 32:17.917
Answer me, damn you! Where is the Tsar?

32:17.918 --> 32:21.837
I don't know, Excellency. They say
the Tsar's dead, and Kutuzov, too.

32:21.838 --> 32:23.397
Wounded! Taken away on a cart!

32:23.398 --> 32:25.077
Where?

32:25.078 --> 32:26.638
That way, Excellency!

32:43.598 --> 32:44.638
That'll do.

34:13.958 --> 34:15.237
How beautiful.

34:17.918 --> 34:20.158
How is it I've never seen this before?

34:21.757 --> 34:26.438
We are all nothing, compared to
this clear, blue, infinite sky.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.958
He looks like a fine young man.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.958
Good way to die, you see.
Carrying the standard.

35:14.678 --> 35:17.317
Oh, it's you. What do you want?

35:17.318 --> 35:19.117
Are you going out this evening?

35:19.118 --> 35:21.317
Yes. Why?

35:21.318 --> 35:27.077
I was thinking we could go out
together. Or stay at home together.

35:27.078 --> 35:29.278
Are you perfectly well, Pierre?

35:30.838 --> 35:33.917
I've been thinking we should...

35:33.918 --> 35:36.078
We should have a child, Helene.

35:38.478 --> 35:42.397
Don't be silly. You know
I'm not the motherly type.

35:42.398 --> 35:45.717
We get along all right,
don't we? Don't spoil things.

35:45.718 --> 35:48.477
I'm not jealous, you can have
other women, as many as you like,

35:48.478 --> 35:50.717
have children with them,
like your father. Why not?

35:50.718 --> 35:55.517
I don't want other women. I want
us to be a proper husband and wife!

35:55.518 --> 35:57.997
We are a proper husband and wife!

35:57.998 --> 36:01.297
Now, stop fussing me.
You'll make me late.

36:05.918 --> 36:09.517
Oh, by the way, I ran into Dolokhov
today. They're all back from war.

36:09.518 --> 36:11.237
The poor fellow's penniless,

36:11.238 --> 36:13.718
I said he could come and
stay here as long as he likes.

36:14.718 --> 36:16.117
That brute?

36:16.118 --> 36:18.317
He's my friend, Helene, and a war hero.

36:18.318 --> 36:20.477
He's an insolent brute,
with no respect for women.

36:20.478 --> 36:24.318
He is my friend, Helene, and you
will treat him as an honoured guest.

36:25.598 --> 36:28.435
All right... Whatever you say.

36:46.918 --> 36:49.038
Look! Those lights! That's our house!

36:52.078 --> 36:53.917
Wake up! We're here!

36:53.918 --> 36:55.198
Already?

37:08.318 --> 37:09.718
Nikki!!

37:11.118 --> 37:13.757
Nikki! My darling boy!

37:13.758 --> 37:15.757
I didn't know you'd be here so soon!

37:15.758 --> 37:17.558
Well, I wanted to surprise you!

37:18.513 --> 37:20.438
Dear Mama!

37:23.718 --> 37:26.157
Vassily Denisov, friend of your son.

37:26.158 --> 37:28.717
Yes, yes, I know, I
know! You're very welcome!

37:28.718 --> 37:30.957
This man taught me all
I know about soldiering!

37:30.958 --> 37:32.957
Looked after him, as best I could.

37:32.958 --> 37:35.917
Well then, you are doubly welcome,
my dear Denisov! Are you hungry?

37:35.918 --> 37:36.957
Yes.

37:36.958 --> 37:38.558
Let's find you something to eat!

37:42.478 --> 37:44.597
Is this one yours, Nikolai?

37:44.598 --> 37:45.677
That one's mine.

37:46.758 --> 37:49.077
Nikolai, are you awake? Come
out, I want to talk to you!

37:49.078 --> 37:52.157
Look, Denisov's sabre! He
killed four Frenchmen with this!

37:52.158 --> 37:54.837
Close the door, Petya!

37:54.838 --> 37:57.077
Come out, Nikki, I want to talk to you!

37:57.078 --> 37:58.598
All right!

37:59.838 --> 38:04.042
I wanted to talk to you. About Sonya.

38:04.478 --> 38:05.798
What about her?

38:07.958 --> 38:10.637
How do you really feel about her?

38:10.638 --> 38:12.158
Is she the only one for you?

38:13.758 --> 38:15.237
Why do you ask that now?

38:15.238 --> 38:18.997
Because it's very important.
For her, if not for you.

38:18.998 --> 38:20.717
Of course she's important to me.

38:20.718 --> 38:21.758
Well, then?

38:22.838 --> 38:23.917
Well, it's simple.

38:23.918 --> 38:26.997
I gave her my word and I
never go back on my word.

38:26.998 --> 38:28.637
No, no, that's duty, not love.

38:28.638 --> 38:30.797
I do love her, Tasha,

38:30.798 --> 38:34.758
but how can I say that I'll never
fall in love with anyone else?

38:36.038 --> 38:37.078
Hmm?

38:39.718 --> 38:41.038
What does she say?

38:42.918 --> 38:47.597
She adores you, but she doesn't
want you to be bound by your word.

38:47.598 --> 38:49.357
She wants you to be free.

38:49.358 --> 38:50.437
She's so good.

38:50.438 --> 38:52.917
Yes, she is, but if
you keep her hanging on

38:52.918 --> 38:55.877
and then break your word,
you'll break her heart.

38:55.878 --> 38:57.518
I could never do that, Tasha.

38:59.798 --> 39:01.518
Well, remember you said that.

39:10.958 --> 39:13.837
Good morning, good
morning, good morning!

39:13.838 --> 39:16.597
Prince Bolkonsky, has there
been any news from the front?

39:16.598 --> 39:20.157
Not as far as I know.
Tikhon, any post today?

39:20.158 --> 39:22.157
Yes, your Excellency, you remember,

39:22.158 --> 39:24.397
about the disposition
of the local militia.

39:24.398 --> 39:26.317
- Nothing else?
- No, your Excellency.

39:26.318 --> 39:29.557
Well, go on, then, don't hang about!
And you would do much better to

39:29.558 --> 39:31.557
occupy yourself with something useful,

39:31.558 --> 39:34.117
instead of making yourself
miserable with apprehension!

39:34.118 --> 39:37.798
Oh yes, yes, we're all worried.
No need to make a show of it.

39:44.478 --> 39:45.518
Here he is!

39:47.198 --> 39:48.238
Countess.

39:52.718 --> 39:55.277
Your wife is even more beautiful
than I remember, Bezukhov.

39:55.278 --> 39:58.717
Thank you, Dolokhov. I
understand you're a war hero now.

39:58.718 --> 40:02.917
Well, you know, there are three
things I love to do... fight, drink

40:02.918 --> 40:04.997
and... I can't remember the other one.

40:04.998 --> 40:08.237
I think you are an absolute ruffian.

40:08.238 --> 40:11.294
- I can't deny it.
- I hope you will

40:11.295 --> 40:12.597
make yourself at home here.

40:12.598 --> 40:15.517
Thank you! I shall!

40:15.518 --> 40:18.797
Don't, don't... !

40:18.798 --> 40:20.357
Let's have a drink!

40:37.078 --> 40:38.118
Helene!

40:42.918 --> 40:47.197
I just want to say thank you for
making poor Dolokhov so welcome.

40:47.198 --> 40:48.318
Oh, Pierre.

40:49.318 --> 40:51.125
- What?
- Can't you see he's

40:51.150 --> 40:53.182
making a fool out of you?

40:57.398 --> 40:58.718
Hell of a woman, that.

41:00.278 --> 41:01.438
You think so?

41:03.278 --> 41:07.367
Yes... Yes, she is, isn't she?

41:17.958 --> 41:18.998
For the Master.

41:27.358 --> 41:28.638
Yes?

41:31.318 --> 41:33.718
Is that the letter
that came this morning?

41:35.718 --> 41:36.758
Yes, it is.

41:38.518 --> 41:39.638
Is it about Andrei?

41:41.238 --> 41:42.958
Yes, it is about your brother.

41:44.318 --> 41:49.352
General Kutuzov writes
that he died a hero.

41:51.278 --> 41:53.917
Kutuzov saw him fall,

41:53.918 --> 41:56.518
carrying the standard
and leading an attack.

41:58.878 --> 42:01.918
Unfortunately, his name
doesn't appear amongst the dead.

42:03.078 --> 42:07.597
Kutuzov gives that as a reason
to hope, but what hope is there?

42:07.598 --> 42:08.758
Of course, he is dead.

42:21.318 --> 42:25.957
Papa, don't turn away from
me. Let's weep together!

42:25.958 --> 42:28.677
Villains! Scoundrels!

42:28.678 --> 42:32.037
The army is led by blockheads,
who don't know how to fight.

42:32.038 --> 42:35.517
All they know is how to lead fine
Russian men to be slaughtered!

42:35.518 --> 42:37.838
And now your brother's dead! He's dead!

42:40.438 --> 42:43.398
Leave me alone. Go and
tell his wife. Go on! Go on!

43:34.318 --> 43:37.838
Marie! Come here. Give me your hand.

43:44.038 --> 43:47.117
There. There, do you feel it?

43:47.118 --> 43:48.477
Yes.

43:48.478 --> 43:53.029
It's so strange. As
if he's talking to us!

43:54.638 --> 43:59.760
I am going to love him so
much. I love him already!

44:02.838 --> 44:04.038
What is it, Masha?

44:10.558 --> 44:13.957
I'm just sad. Sad about
Andrei, that's all.

44:13.958 --> 44:17.277
Why? Have you heard something?

44:17.278 --> 44:19.237
Oh, no!

44:19.238 --> 44:22.037
No, no, no, no. It's
too early for any news,

44:22.038 --> 44:24.997
it's just Papa worries and
I'm frightened. That's all.

44:24.998 --> 44:27.357
Are you sure? You frightened me!

44:27.358 --> 44:30.202
Lise. There's no news.

44:32.878 --> 44:34.438
I must go back to Papa.

44:58.998 --> 45:00.038
I didn't tell her.

45:03.838 --> 45:06.077
And you must not tell her, either.

45:06.078 --> 45:07.597
She is in such a delicate state,

45:07.598 --> 45:10.277
and so close to her confinement, I...

45:10.278 --> 45:11.318
All right.

45:12.478 --> 45:13.517
Do you agree?

45:13.518 --> 45:15.557
I said all right! Thank
you! That's the end of it!

45:51.598 --> 45:53.078
Mm!

45:57.278 --> 45:59.837
Dolokhov, really!

45:59.838 --> 46:03.278
Funny how it always tastes better
from another fellow's plate.

47:30.998 --> 47:32.558
- Hello!
- Hello.

47:34.798 --> 47:37.037
All right, remember me?

47:37.038 --> 47:39.317
You're a fine fellow!

47:39.318 --> 47:42.797
You've all grown. I'd
have hardly recognised you!

47:53.158 --> 47:55.397
Look who's come to visit us!

47:55.398 --> 48:00.637
Oh, Pierre! We haven't seen you in ages!

48:00.638 --> 48:04.117
Now I see you, I wish I'd
come sooner. How are you all?

48:04.118 --> 48:08.997
Nikolai! You're a real
man now, I can tell.

48:08.998 --> 48:10.637
Something's changed in you, I think.

48:10.638 --> 48:12.037
For the good, I hope.

48:12.038 --> 48:13.517
Yes, yes, of course!

48:13.518 --> 48:16.677
My friend Captain Vassily
Denisov, of the Pavlograd Hussars.

48:16.678 --> 48:18.117
I'm privileged to meet you, sir.

48:18.118 --> 48:21.717
I feel ashamed of my lazy life
when I see men like you and Nikolai.

48:21.718 --> 48:24.077
Heroes. I should have been with you.

48:24.078 --> 48:26.357
I used to think of
Napoleon as a hero, you see.

48:26.358 --> 48:29.277
And perhaps he was, once, but not
now. He seems to think of nothing

48:29.278 --> 48:31.358
but conquest and glory.
He had to be stopped!

48:32.918 --> 48:33.958
I was wrong.

48:36.558 --> 48:39.757
Papa's hosting a banquet
for our returning soldiers!

48:39.758 --> 48:41.477
I hope you will come, Pierre?

48:41.478 --> 48:44.117
Yes, yes, indeed. It will be an
honour to drink to their health!

48:44.118 --> 48:46.757
Talking of heroes, isn't
Dolokhov making his home with you?

48:46.758 --> 48:48.197
Yes. Yes, he is.

48:48.198 --> 48:50.238
It was so kind of you to take him in.

48:51.238 --> 48:53.157
Well, one does what one can.

48:53.158 --> 48:54.558
Splendid fellow.

48:56.678 --> 49:00.198
It's so good to be
here with you all again.

49:01.678 --> 49:04.957
What is it, Pierre? Why are you sad?

49:04.958 --> 49:08.077
It's nothing. I'm not sad.

49:08.078 --> 49:09.278
Just happy to see you.

49:10.718 --> 49:14.077
I thought you might have
brought the Countess.

49:14.078 --> 49:16.078
Sadly, she's otherwise engaged.

49:18.358 --> 49:20.517
What a vile creature you are, Dolokhov.

49:20.518 --> 49:21.998
And don't you love it?!

49:23.358 --> 49:26.598
I hate you. You're an animal.

49:49.238 --> 49:50.597
Ah!

49:50.598 --> 49:52.597
What is it, dearest?

49:52.598 --> 49:54.717
I don't know.

49:54.718 --> 49:57.637
I think something in my breakfast
must have disagreed with me.

49:57.638 --> 49:59.277
Look at her. She's very pale!

50:00.998 --> 50:03.197
Hadn't we better send
for Maria Bogdanovna?

50:03.198 --> 50:05.797
Yes, I think you're right,
I'll go and see to it.

50:05.798 --> 50:07.357
Courage, mon ange!

50:07.358 --> 50:11.117
No! Can it be, so soon?

50:11.118 --> 50:13.197
But surely it's just a stomach ache?

50:13.198 --> 50:15.598
It's best to be on the
safe side, ma cherie.

50:22.998 --> 50:24.757
When did this come?

50:24.758 --> 50:26.918
- Just now, your Excellency.
- Thank you.

50:32.598 --> 50:36.277
"Perhaps you should get some
new spectacles, Count Bezukhov,

50:36.278 --> 50:39.277
then you might see what
everyone sees but you...

50:39.278 --> 50:41.398
your wife's affair with Dolokhov."

51:11.638 --> 51:12.917
What's the matter?

51:12.918 --> 51:14.718
Nothing.

51:15.718 --> 51:16.758
I'm going out.

51:19.158 --> 51:21.797
Are you going to the
men's dinner this evening?

51:21.798 --> 51:25.157
Yes. No! I don't know! I
suppose I might, as well.

51:25.158 --> 51:28.078
Why not? Your disgusting
friend Dolokhov's going.

51:30.638 --> 51:32.958
Try not to drink too
much, the pair of you!

52:28.398 --> 52:32.117
Princess, someone's come down the
avenue. A coach, with lanterns!

52:32.118 --> 52:35.398
Oh, thank God. The doctor, at last!

52:49.158 --> 52:50.798
Quickly! Are you the doctor?

52:52.838 --> 52:54.278
Andrei!

52:55.878 --> 52:57.077
Dear Masha!

52:57.078 --> 52:58.118
Is it really you?

53:03.198 --> 53:05.398
Come inside, quickly!

53:15.438 --> 53:17.837
I can't... I can't bear it!

53:17.838 --> 53:20.677
There, there. Not long now.

53:20.678 --> 53:21.878
Courage, ma petite.

53:27.278 --> 53:28.598
My darling!

53:34.358 --> 53:36.877
If you would wait outside,
your Excellency. I must insist,

53:36.878 --> 53:37.918
it's for the best.

54:05.718 --> 54:07.478
No, no, you mustn't come in!

55:46.598 --> 55:48.678
Your son, Your Excellency?

56:39.998 --> 56:41.557
Come, Prince Bagration, cheer up.

56:41.558 --> 56:44.077
You're our guest of honour, you know.

56:44.078 --> 56:46.757
Yes, that's Russia for you.
Suffer a terrible defeat,

56:46.758 --> 56:48.197
and they praise you to the skies.

56:48.198 --> 56:49.917
No, no, we'll have none of that!

56:49.918 --> 56:53.277
All our commanders are first-class
men. We'll thrash Napoleon yet.

56:57.078 --> 56:59.317
To the health of our sovereign Emperor

56:59.318 --> 57:01.797
and to our fearless Prince Bagration!

57:01.798 --> 57:03.197
Bezukhov, the Emperor!

57:03.198 --> 57:04.758
Hurrah!

57:06.638 --> 57:10.477
The choir will now sing a cantata
in praise of our great General

57:10.478 --> 57:15.317
and souvenir copies of the
music will be distributed.

57:26.158 --> 57:28.437
To the husbands of pretty women!

57:28.438 --> 57:29.877
Hear, hear!

57:29.878 --> 57:32.358
To the health of beautiful women!

57:33.958 --> 57:37.277
Eh? To the health of
beautiful women, Petrushka,

57:37.278 --> 57:38.958
and their lovers!

57:47.558 --> 57:49.358
Don't you dare take what is mine!

57:52.278 --> 57:54.477
Really, Petrushka, what is the matter?

57:54.478 --> 57:56.638
Scoundrel! I challenge you!

57:58.198 --> 57:59.678
I challenge you!

58:05.318 --> 58:06.678
I accept.
