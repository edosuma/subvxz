04:20.692 --> 04:23.526
You are confused, aren't you?
Frightened.

04:23.563 --> 04:25.258
That's all right. I can help you.

04:25.298 --> 04:26.287
Who is this?

04:26.332 --> 04:28.357
I am a doctor.
Now, you must listen to me.

04:28.401 --> 04:31.063
You have lost your memory.
There was an experiment.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.004
Something went wrong.
Your memory was erased.

04:33.039 --> 04:34.028
Do you understand me?

04:34.073 --> 04:36.166
No, I don't understand.
What the hell is going on here?

04:36.209 --> 04:38.734
Just listen. There are people
coming for you even as we speak.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.713
You must not let them find you.
You must leave now.

04:42.482 --> 04:45.246
Hello? Are you there?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.812
Hey, Mr. Murdoch.
The Automat called.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.780
Said you left your wallet there.

05:49.749 --> 05:53.014
I suggest you retrieve it since
you only paid for 3 weeks...

05:53.052 --> 05:54.917
and they was up 10 minutes ago.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.615
I've been here 3 weeks?

05:58.658 --> 06:00.990
It's right there in
black and white, Mr. Murdoch.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.423
Day and date.

06:04.130 --> 06:07.588
We make our books like we make
our beds, all neat and tidy.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.464
I'll take care of it when I get back.

06:09.502 --> 06:11.663
See that you do.
Only thing makes you a guest...

06:11.704 --> 06:14.036
in this joint, pal,
is cash on the barrelhead.

06:38.030 --> 06:40.555
House rules.
3 weeks is 3 weeks.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.364
No days off for good behavior.

07:05.358 --> 07:08.987
Mr. Murdoch, yes, where is he?

07:09.028 --> 07:12.725
He just left not 5 minutes ago.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.895
Sleep now.

07:20.039 --> 07:24.237
# When marimba rhythms
start to play #

07:24.277 --> 07:26.336
# Dance with me #

07:26.379 --> 07:29.371
# Make me sway #

07:29.415 --> 07:33.545
# Like a lazy ocean
hugs the shore #

07:33.586 --> 07:35.781
# Hold me close #

07:35.822 --> 07:38.586
# Sway me more #

07:38.624 --> 07:42.890
# Like a flower
bending in the breeze #

07:42.929 --> 07:45.329
# Bend with me #

07:45.364 --> 07:48.265
# Sway with ease #

07:48.301 --> 07:52.465
# When we dance
you have a way with me #

07:52.505 --> 07:54.700
# Stay with me #

07:54.740 --> 07:57.174
# Sway with me #

07:58.077 --> 07:59.066
Hey, sweetie!

08:00.046 --> 08:02.139
He said he was your
husband's doctor.

08:02.181 --> 08:03.648
He wanted to speak with you.

08:24.036 --> 08:25.025
Excuse me.

08:26.873 --> 08:28.067
Dr. Sh...

08:28.107 --> 08:31.133
Schreber. Please,
won't you come in?

08:31.177 --> 08:33.270
You must be Emma Murdoch.

08:34.179 --> 08:37.308
Thank you for coming to see me
on such short notice.

08:39.118 --> 08:40.847
What is this?

08:41.787 --> 08:45.814
A rather crude experiment...
designed to further my studies.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.018
I don't understand.

08:47.059 --> 08:52.156
You say you're my husband's doctor,
but he never mentioned you to me.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.529
The truth is, Mrs. Murdoch...

08:53.566 --> 08:56.034
John has been coming to
see me for quite some time.

08:56.068 --> 08:59.799
He had been grappling
with feelings of betrayal...

08:59.839 --> 09:02.967
stemming from your
marital difficulties.

09:03.009 --> 09:05.170
- John told you what happened?
- Yes.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.543
When was the last time
that you saw him?

09:08.581 --> 09:10.048
3 weeks ago.

09:10.082 --> 09:13.848
He packed a suitcase.
He was very angry at me.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.878
I understand how difficult
this must be for you.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.550
But for John's sake,
I would like you...

09:18.591 --> 09:21.219
to think of me
as your friend, Emma.

09:21.260 --> 09:25.026
It appears that John has suffered
a psychotic break.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.292
Complete memory loss.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.959
He may be delusional.

09:30.002 --> 09:31.902
Even violent.

09:31.938 --> 09:33.371
Emma...

09:34.674 --> 09:37.837
if he were to contact you,
and I suspect he will...

09:37.877 --> 09:40.744
you must call me immediately.
Do you understand?

09:40.780 --> 09:45.149
It is imperative that I be
the first one to reach him.

09:45.184 --> 09:48.517
Wherever your husband is,
he is searching...

09:50.423 --> 09:52.414
...for himself.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.400
Good evening, Mr. Murdoch.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.201
It is Mr. Murdoch, isn't it?

10:07.239 --> 10:11.107
Mr... was it
"J"...something... Murdoch?

10:14.046 --> 10:15.240
J. Murdoch.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.773
What's your name? Justin? Jerry?

10:19.619 --> 10:20.847
No.

10:22.488 --> 10:24.581
My name's Jason Murdoch.
John Murdoch.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.057
Jake Murdoch. How's it going?

10:26.092 --> 10:27.252
Hi. Jack Murdoch.

10:30.563 --> 10:31.552
Hi.

11:11.437 --> 11:12.768
Bumstead.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.670
I told the guy,
"Cash on the barrelhead."

11:17.710 --> 11:21.168
I said, "Listen, 3 weeks is 3 weeks."

11:21.213 --> 11:22.441
Where's our lucky winner?

11:22.481 --> 11:25.314
Upstairs, sir, room 614.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.115
Another call girl.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.679
"J. Murdoch."

11:31.857 --> 11:33.586
Evening, Husselbeck.

11:33.626 --> 11:34.957
Inspector Bumstead.

11:34.994 --> 11:36.928
Your lace is untied.

11:37.563 --> 11:39.224
Sir.

11:50.142 --> 11:51.632
Am I glad you're here, sir.

11:51.677 --> 11:54.305
They say Detective Walenski's
got the heebie-jeebies.

11:54.346 --> 11:56.610
Just take what they give me,
Husselbeck.

12:03.889 --> 12:07.791
Wow. Looks like somebody
woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.395
- Hello.
- Oh, it's you.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.838
You left your wallet here, buddy.

12:54.874 --> 12:56.171
When did I do that?

12:56.208 --> 12:57.334
When you was last here.

12:57.376 --> 13:00.504
- When was that?
- When you left your wallet.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.309
You expect me to remember?

13:05.117 --> 13:08.348
Hello. Excuse me.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.256
No, no, seriously.

13:14.059 --> 13:15.526
Alleged?

13:29.742 --> 13:31.869
- Where you headed, chief?
- Home.

13:31.911 --> 13:32.935
And where's home?

13:32.978 --> 13:35.742
Haven't you mugs got
anything better to do?

13:35.781 --> 13:38.045
Well, I'm just trying
to do my job, May.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.142
There's a killer out there
in case you hadn't noticed.

13:40.186 --> 13:42.882
Maybe you should be out looking for him
instead of cooling your heels, huh?

13:46.258 --> 13:47.885
Go on, get out of here.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.224
Come on.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.667
Round and round she goes.

14:03.108 --> 14:07.204
Where she stops? Nobody knows.

14:10.382 --> 14:13.510
What's that make so far, Husselbeck?
6 hookers in all?

14:13.552 --> 14:15.019
I believe so, sir.

14:15.054 --> 14:17.579
Give the man an "A" for effort.

14:17.623 --> 14:19.853
You'd think these stiffs
would have the good grace...

14:19.892 --> 14:22.019
to expire at a good time of night.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.996
Hey, too bad about Walenski, huh?

14:28.667 --> 14:30.191
I guess he'd seen enough.

14:37.309 --> 14:38.298
So, Husselbeck...

14:39.745 --> 14:46.116
what kind of killer do you think
stops to save a dying fish?

14:46.151 --> 14:47.140
You've got me, sir.

14:47.186 --> 14:49.313
Bumstead, what took you?

14:49.355 --> 14:52.620
This killer's been running circles
around us thanks to Walenski.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.421
With all due respect,
Chief Inspector...

14:54.460 --> 14:57.452
I've known Eddie a long time.
He's a good cop.

14:57.496 --> 15:01.694
Whatever kind of cop Walenski once was,
he let drift a long time ago.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.565
Let me talk to Bumstead!

15:03.602 --> 15:04.967
Come on, let's go.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.369
Hold on!

15:06.405 --> 15:08.703
Frank, Frank!

15:10.175 --> 15:11.301
Get his arm!

15:11.343 --> 15:12.332
They're watching us!

15:12.378 --> 15:13.402
On your feet.

15:13.445 --> 15:14.878
There's no way out!

15:14.914 --> 15:16.245
Don't make us hurt you.

15:16.282 --> 15:18.011
God, can't you see?!

15:21.387 --> 15:22.718
Let me go, let me go!

15:22.755 --> 15:24.222
I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not...

15:25.291 --> 15:27.521
- What was that?
- Walenski.

15:35.901 --> 15:39.064
I'm being punished for my sins, right?

15:39.104 --> 15:41.470
What did I ever do to inherit this?

15:41.507 --> 15:42.599
Where do you begin?

15:42.641 --> 15:47.635
Well, everything Detective Walenski
committed to paper should be here, so...

15:47.680 --> 15:51.172
The only thing that should
be committed is Walenski.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.117
Nothing like a little healthy paranoia.

15:58.657 --> 16:01.785
Sir, we just got
the fingerprint results in.

16:05.164 --> 16:06.927
What is this, some kind of joke?

16:11.170 --> 16:12.535
Don't throw anything away.

16:18.677 --> 16:19.769
Inspector Bumstead.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.777
I came here to file
a missing persons report for my husband.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.451
Take it to the front desk.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.317
They told me to come see you.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.285
His name's John Murdoch.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.352
Mrs. Murdoch,
why didn't you report this before?

16:37.396 --> 16:42.595
I mean, if your husband has been missing
as long as you say...

16:42.634 --> 16:45.330
I thought he'd simply
walked out on me.

16:46.505 --> 16:50.464
Then a... doctor contacted me
this evening.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.136
How long have you been married?

16:52.177 --> 16:53.474
Nearly four years.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.445
Why do you ask?

16:56.482 --> 16:59.576
Because you seem uncomfortable
with your ring.

16:59.618 --> 17:03.281
As if you were...
unaccustomed to wearing it.

17:03.322 --> 17:04.755
No, I never take it off.

17:11.329 --> 17:15.357
Do these names
mean anything to you?

17:20.705 --> 17:22.606
No. Who are these women?

17:23.509 --> 17:25.204
Why are you looking
for my husband?

17:25.911 --> 17:27.776
Are you going to accuse him
of something?

17:27.813 --> 17:30.111
Maybe. Maybe murder.

17:30.149 --> 17:31.173
Whose murder?

17:32.584 --> 17:36.281
- Which one?
- All of them.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.451
Mrs. Murdoch,
I am sorry, I'm sorry.

17:39.491 --> 17:40.549
I didn't mean to alarm you.

17:40.592 --> 17:43.152
I'm so sorry that I came.
Just both made a mistake.

17:43.195 --> 17:44.662
Mrs. Murdoch, if you please.

17:44.696 --> 17:47.130
If you'll just give me
half a second to explain...

17:50.469 --> 17:51.458
I'll be right out.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.925
Have we met before?

18:17.963 --> 18:21.592
If we did...
I hope you're still breathing.

18:21.633 --> 18:23.260
What's your name, honey?

18:24.937 --> 18:26.302
John.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.802
Well, that's an appropriate name.

18:29.708 --> 18:30.697
Yeah.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.043
I was just thinking.

18:42.254 --> 18:43.812
What you do...

18:45.057 --> 18:48.356
seems kind of dangerous...

18:48.393 --> 18:50.384
right now.

18:50.429 --> 18:52.158
I mean, how do you know
I'm not the killer?

18:52.197 --> 18:55.394
You don't seem like
the killer type. Why?

18:56.602 --> 18:59.127
You feeling any urges
I should know about?

19:20.659 --> 19:22.251
Aw, shoot.

20:20.919 --> 20:24.650
So it seems you've discovered
your unpleasant nature.

20:27.826 --> 20:28.850
Who are you?

20:28.894 --> 20:32.557
We might ask
the same question, yes?

20:32.598 --> 20:35.192
Sleep now.

21:01.960 --> 21:02.892
He can tune.

21:55.981 --> 21:59.280
What is to be done?
This man is dangerous.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.252
It is said he is able to tune.

22:01.286 --> 22:02.651
Impossible.

22:02.688 --> 22:05.486
We have seen it
with our own eyes.

22:05.524 --> 22:07.958
On occasion the imprinting
does not take.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.962
They behave erratically
when they awaken.

22:10.996 --> 22:14.625
We find them wandering
like lost children.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.827
But this one was different, yes?

22:16.868 --> 22:18.563
What has the doctor
to say about this?

22:18.603 --> 22:20.594
He has failed to report in.

22:20.639 --> 22:23.767
- And Mr. Quick?
- No more Mr. Quick.

22:23.809 --> 22:26.801
Mr. Quick, dead, yes.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.442
Poor, poor Mr. Quick.

22:32.484 --> 22:35.351
Mr. Book, does he know?

22:36.688 --> 22:38.519
Should we not know, Mr. Hand?

22:39.491 --> 22:42.358
We had hoped to learn more
before sharing with you.

22:42.394 --> 22:45.329
We can know nothing
until we possess him.

22:46.398 --> 22:48.958
Mr. Night, you will take the East.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.798
Mr. Face, you the West.

22:51.837 --> 22:53.930
Mr. Glove, the South.

22:53.972 --> 22:56.202
Mr. Shade, the North.

22:57.743 --> 23:00.712
We must have this man.

23:14.359 --> 23:19.353
Do you really think my husband could be
capable of committing those murders?

23:19.931 --> 23:21.956
Do you?

23:23.034 --> 23:26.492
Let's hope, for both our sakes,
that I'm wrong.

23:54.599 --> 23:55.861
John.

24:10.215 --> 24:12.342
I've been so worried about you.

24:15.754 --> 24:17.847
Are you punishing me?

24:17.889 --> 24:20.483
You know, if disappearing
is your way of punishing me...

24:20.525 --> 24:21.617
I don't appreciate it.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.719
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:26.565 --> 24:29.056
I found these keys in my pocket...

24:29.100 --> 24:31.796
so I assume I live here.

24:31.837 --> 24:33.600
You supposed to be my wife?

24:33.638 --> 24:35.663
Supposed to be?

24:35.707 --> 24:37.732
John.

24:38.243 --> 24:40.006
You really...

24:40.045 --> 24:43.276
don't know who I am, do you?

24:43.315 --> 24:44.509
Your doctor called me.

24:44.549 --> 24:46.039
He was worried
that this might happen.

24:46.084 --> 24:47.574
My doctor?

24:47.619 --> 24:50.144
Yeah. He...

24:50.188 --> 24:52.213
he gave me his card.

24:52.257 --> 24:54.782
He's desperate to find you.

24:54.826 --> 24:57.351
Schreber.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.759
I feel like I'm living out
someone else's nightmare.

25:03.802 --> 25:06.566
What happened to me?
Why was I seeing a doctor?

25:07.305 --> 25:09.432
I had an affair.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.943
You were angry at me.

25:15.380 --> 25:17.245
The police are looking for you.

25:17.282 --> 25:19.580
I know. I saw the papers.

25:19.618 --> 25:22.178
"Killer stalks city streetwalkers."

25:25.690 --> 25:29.285
I was with one of those women...

25:29.327 --> 25:31.124
before I came here tonight.

25:31.796 --> 25:33.457
I don't understand.

25:33.498 --> 25:34.965
I met her outside an Automat.

25:36.468 --> 25:39.028
I guess I wanted to test myself.

25:39.070 --> 25:43.006
I wanted to know if I had it in me
to do those things.

25:43.041 --> 25:47.637
Maybe I have lost my mind, but whoever
I am, I'm still me and I'm not a killer.

25:53.985 --> 25:55.953
I believe you.

25:56.855 --> 25:59.016
You do?

26:02.227 --> 26:03.216
What?

26:03.261 --> 26:06.059
The car outside,
the one you arrived in.

26:06.097 --> 26:08.429
It's a cop.
He dropped me off here.

26:10.569 --> 26:13.197
I didn't know he was still here.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.262
John.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.304
Hold it right there, mister!

26:19.711 --> 26:21.679
Wait. You have the wrong man.

26:21.713 --> 26:22.839
Stand aside, will you, please?

26:22.881 --> 26:24.473
I didn't kill anyone.

26:24.516 --> 26:27.610
Right now what you are
is a suspect. Turn yourself in.

26:28.553 --> 26:30.111
I'll listen to whatever
you have to say.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.055
You're not gonna believe
what I have to say.

26:33.158 --> 26:34.250
Try me.

26:34.859 --> 26:36.417
There's someone after me.

26:36.461 --> 26:39.589
There's this group of men.
They want me dead.

26:39.631 --> 26:42.259
And I don't even know if...
They're not even...

26:43.034 --> 26:45.264
Yeah, who's gonna
listen to a madman?

26:45.303 --> 26:47.100
Stand aside, Mrs. Murdoch.

26:47.138 --> 26:48.264
Run!

26:52.110 --> 26:54.840
No one ever listens to me.

27:00.385 --> 27:01.511
Murdoch, stop!

27:06.591 --> 27:07.956
Murdoch!

27:44.162 --> 27:45.151
How much further?

27:45.196 --> 27:46.720
We're almost there, buddy.

27:49.434 --> 27:52.733
Hey, you happen to know
the way to Shell Beach?

27:52.771 --> 27:55.672
You're kidding. Me and the missus
spent our honeymoon there.

27:55.707 --> 27:58.437
All you gotta do is take
Main Street west to...

28:01.279 --> 28:02.974
Or is it the cross...

28:03.014 --> 28:06.643
You know, that's funny.
I can't seem to remember...

28:06.685 --> 28:08.983
if it's Main Street west
or the cross-town.

28:13.658 --> 28:17.185
I'm sorry, Inspector,
I cannot be of more assistance...

28:17.228 --> 28:19.093
but I am running late
for an appointment.

28:19.130 --> 28:21.325
Well, I appreciate
your taking the time.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.939
There's just one thing
that puzzles me.

28:31.976 --> 28:36.640
I've met quite a few murderers
in the course of my work.

28:36.681 --> 28:39.343
Murdoch doesn't strike me as one.

28:39.384 --> 28:43.047
Perhaps you are not
accustomed to digging deep enough.

28:43.088 --> 28:45.613
Well, I do know when someone
is lying to me, Doctor.

28:45.657 --> 28:48.285
Forgive me, Inspector,
but you are not a clinician.

28:48.326 --> 28:52.057
Judging personalities
happens to be my business.

28:52.097 --> 28:54.122
Well, maybe you could
give me a few pointers.

28:54.165 --> 28:55.996
Certainly.

28:56.034 --> 28:58.059
Let's take you, for instance.

28:58.103 --> 29:01.470
You are a fastidious man, driven.

29:01.506 --> 29:03.565
Consumed by details.

29:04.342 --> 29:06.242
I would say your life is...

29:07.545 --> 29:08.534
rather lonely.

29:09.347 --> 29:11.907
Good evening, Inspector.
I really must be going.

29:53.291 --> 29:57.625
Closing time.
The pool is now closed.

30:04.402 --> 30:05.391
Dr. Schreber.

30:07.172 --> 30:11.802
Most unfortunate it is that we were
forced to seek you out here.

30:12.744 --> 30:15.406
You know how uncomfortable
we find all this...

30:16.114 --> 30:17.376
moisture.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.979
- I'm sorry. I...
- Failed to report in, yes.

30:21.019 --> 30:23.647
I was frightened.
I have a weak heart, you know.

30:23.688 --> 30:27.556
Your weakness is not, we think,
an affair of the heart.

30:27.592 --> 30:30.254
We found this
in his hotel room.

30:30.295 --> 30:34.231
Must we reproduce
Mr. Murdoch's memories again?

30:34.265 --> 30:35.323
I tried to imprint him...

30:35.366 --> 30:37.493
but he woke up, he knocked the syringe
right out of my hand.

30:37.535 --> 30:39.628
I tried to stop him but he was too fast.

30:39.671 --> 30:40.831
He has no memories, then?

30:40.872 --> 30:44.239
Only fragments.
The procedure, it was interrupted.

30:44.275 --> 30:48.075
I guess it's only a matter
of rounding him up.

30:48.112 --> 30:49.670
You have had strays
before, right?

30:49.714 --> 30:53.343
This is no stray, Doctor.
This one can tune.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.583
But that's impossible.
I thought only you had that ability.

30:56.621 --> 31:00.921
You will process another template
of the subject's memories, yes?

31:00.959 --> 31:02.688
Of course. I'll imprint him again.

31:02.727 --> 31:07.221
No. We require them
for a quite different purpose.

31:08.066 --> 31:10.534
It's almost midnight,
Dr. Schreber.

31:10.568 --> 31:13.002
We'll talk again
after tonight's tuning, but...

31:13.571 --> 31:15.368
no more delays, yes?

31:15.406 --> 31:20.207
No more inconsistencies
in your behavior.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.586
You appear quite frail, Doctor.

31:31.356 --> 31:34.848
Perhaps some exercise
would do you good.

31:48.506 --> 31:49.632
- Come in.
- Kate.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.407
- How is he?
- The same.

31:57.782 --> 32:00.376
Walenski? It's me, Frank.

32:06.724 --> 32:08.214
Come in, Frank.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.995
Close the door.

32:20.438 --> 32:23.805
I've been looking through
some of your old reports.

32:23.841 --> 32:25.866
It's an interesting case.

32:27.045 --> 32:31.880
The kind that can make
a man's career...

32:31.916 --> 32:33.110
or break it.

32:33.151 --> 32:35.483
Yeah, I was on that case.

32:35.520 --> 32:39.786
And then what?
What happened then, Eddie?

32:39.824 --> 32:41.655
Nothing happened, Frank.

32:41.693 --> 32:45.823
I've just been spending time
on the subway, riding in circles.

32:45.863 --> 32:47.763
Thinking in circles.

32:48.666 --> 32:49.758
There's no way out.

32:51.569 --> 32:53.434
I've been over every inch
of this city.

32:58.176 --> 33:00.542
You're scaring your wife
to death, Eddie.

33:00.578 --> 33:02.273
She's not my wife.

33:03.781 --> 33:06.750
I don't know who she is.
I don't know who any of us are.

33:06.784 --> 33:08.718
What makes you say that?

33:08.753 --> 33:10.812
Do you think about
the past much, Frank?

33:12.290 --> 33:13.757
As much as the next guy.

33:14.359 --> 33:17.487
See, I've been trying
to remember things...

33:17.528 --> 33:20.224
clearly remember things
from my past.

33:20.264 --> 33:25.702
But the more I try to think back,
the more it all starts to unravel.

33:25.737 --> 33:27.068
None of it seems real.

33:27.105 --> 33:30.472
It's like I've just been
dreaming this life...

33:30.508 --> 33:34.069
and when I finally wake up
I'll be somebody else.

33:34.112 --> 33:35.943
Somebody totally different.

33:40.685 --> 33:43.381
You saw something,
didn't you, Eddie?

33:43.421 --> 33:46.413
Something to do with the case.

33:47.025 --> 33:50.483
There is no case.
There never was!

33:50.528 --> 33:54.965
It's all just a big joke!
It's a joke!

34:35.440 --> 34:38.204
Tonight's requirements are...

34:38.242 --> 34:43.009
12 family photo albums,
9 personal diaries...

34:43.047 --> 34:47.984
17 love letters,
assorted childhood photographs...

34:48.018 --> 34:52.114
26 wallets,
ID's and social security cards.

34:52.156 --> 34:54.248
These do bring back memories.

34:56.627 --> 34:58.857
This one is still warm.

34:58.896 --> 35:00.693
What is it?

35:00.731 --> 35:03.928
The recollections of a great lover?

35:03.968 --> 35:06.994
A catalog of conquests?

35:07.038 --> 35:08.528
We will soon find out.

35:09.907 --> 35:14.537
You wouldn't appreciate that,
would you, Mr. <i>Whatever your name is</i> ?

35:14.579 --> 35:18.948
Not the sort of conquests
you would ever understand.

35:19.917 --> 35:20.941
Let's see.

35:22.253 --> 35:24.949
A touch of unhappy childhood.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.491
A dash of teenage rebellion.

35:35.266 --> 35:38.064
And last, but not least...

35:38.102 --> 35:40.366
a tragic death in the family.

35:40.404 --> 35:41.393
Doctor.

35:43.574 --> 35:44.632
Mr. Book.

35:52.116 --> 35:53.845
Why does Murdoch not sleep...

35:53.885 --> 35:55.785
during the tuning as the others do?

35:55.820 --> 35:59.950
I don't know. Maybe he's a step up
the evolutionary ladder.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.858
A freak of nature.
He's adapting to survive.

36:02.894 --> 36:06.295
What do you expect?
Weren't you looking for the human soul?

36:06.330 --> 36:08.890
That's the purpose
of your little zoo, isn't it?

36:08.933 --> 36:12.266
That's why you keep changing people
and things around every night.

36:12.303 --> 36:15.397
Maybe you have finally found
what you are looking for...

36:15.439 --> 36:16.633
and it's going
to bite you on your...

36:20.611 --> 36:24.240
It requires several of your lifetimes
to master our gifts.

36:24.282 --> 36:28.150
The idea that a simple man
could develop the ability to tune...

36:28.186 --> 36:29.710
Is absurd, I know...

36:29.754 --> 36:31.813
but what other
explanation is there?

36:36.627 --> 36:38.618
It is time.

37:23.774 --> 37:25.139
Shut it down.

37:40.791 --> 37:42.156
Get your paper right here!

37:53.671 --> 37:55.400
It's driving me crazy.

37:55.439 --> 37:56.872
I can't sleep.

37:56.907 --> 37:58.704
And they call my job "unskilled".

37:58.743 --> 38:00.040
You think you've got it tough?

38:00.077 --> 38:01.942
You try looking after these kids,
for a change.

38:02.847 --> 38:06.977
Anyways, Frederickson says
he'll take me off the damn night shift soon.

38:07.518 --> 38:09.418
Well, it's about time, dear.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.185
Hello?

39:29.033 --> 39:30.159
Hello?!

39:34.405 --> 39:35.804
Wake up!

39:35.873 --> 39:36.862
Hey!

39:39.243 --> 39:40.608
Wake up!

39:40.644 --> 39:42.544
Wake up!

39:44.215 --> 39:46.115
Wake up!

39:47.518 --> 39:49.247
Hello?!

39:50.621 --> 39:52.680
Can anybody hear me?!

39:55.760 --> 39:59.218
Let the tuning commence.

42:38.822 --> 42:41.848
The Goodwins.
Jeremy, Sylvia...

42:41.892 --> 42:44.190
Jane and little Matthew.

42:47.998 --> 42:50.057
Jane and little Matthew.

43:20.197 --> 43:22.859
The rich get richer.

43:22.900 --> 43:26.563
Probably have maid's quarters
before the night is through.

44:19.757 --> 44:21.554
Dr. Schreber, I presume.

44:22.092 --> 44:23.081
It's you.

44:23.127 --> 44:24.526
Hey, come on.

44:24.561 --> 44:26.756
That's no way to greet
a patient, Doctor.

44:26.797 --> 44:28.560
If that's what you are,
huh, Doctor?

44:28.599 --> 44:29.998
Mr. Murdoch, please, I...

44:30.034 --> 44:31.899
What is happening here?
Why is everyone asleep?

44:31.935 --> 44:34.301
Shh. Please keep your voice down.

44:34.338 --> 44:36.272
Why can't I remember anything?
What have you done to me?

44:36.306 --> 44:39.070
Nothing, nothing.
Please, I want to help you.

44:39.109 --> 44:40.406
We can't talk here.

44:40.444 --> 44:42.639
It is not safe.
If they see us together, they'll...

44:42.680 --> 44:44.113
I don't care.
I want some answers.

44:44.148 --> 44:45.479
I want some answers now!

44:45.516 --> 44:46.676
Who are they?

44:46.717 --> 44:48.651
Why are they trying to kill me?

44:48.686 --> 44:49.846
Answer me!

44:55.092 --> 44:58.255
My God. You really can do it.

44:58.295 --> 44:59.592
I did that?

44:59.630 --> 45:01.860
Listen to me, John.
You have their power.

45:01.899 --> 45:03.992
You can make things happen
by will alone.

45:04.034 --> 45:07.333
They call it tuning. That is how they make
the buildings change.

45:07.371 --> 45:09.931
Just now you acted out
of self-defense. A reflex.

45:09.973 --> 45:12.806
But I can teach you to control
your power consciously.

45:12.843 --> 45:15.175
Let me help you, John.
Together we can stop them.

45:15.212 --> 45:16.839
We can take the city back.

45:20.050 --> 45:20.846
My glasses.

45:23.320 --> 45:25.254
My glasses, please.

46:12.369 --> 46:15.031
He made a terrible
impression for the firm...

46:15.072 --> 46:17.404
lollygagging around as he did.

46:17.441 --> 46:20.342
So I simply told Frederickson
I was going to have to let him go.

46:20.377 --> 46:23.073
And well you should have, darling.

46:23.413 --> 46:24.778
He attacked me.

46:25.749 --> 46:26.977
I don't know where he has gone.

46:28.085 --> 46:29.950
Come, Dr. Schreber.

46:30.988 --> 46:32.580
We have much to do.

46:32.623 --> 46:34.386
Yes?

46:34.925 --> 46:36.119
Yes.

46:51.108 --> 46:58.708
# They say that you're
a run-around lover #

46:58.749 --> 47:02.651
# Though you say #

47:02.686 --> 47:06.588
# It isn't so #

47:09.760 --> 47:15.528
# But if you put me down
for another #

47:17.868 --> 47:20.098
# I'll know #

47:20.137 --> 47:24.574
# Believe me, I'll know #

47:26.276 --> 47:30.144
# 'Cause the night #

47:30.180 --> 47:34.116
# Has a thousand eyes #

47:35.018 --> 47:38.954
# And a thousand eyes #

47:38.989 --> 47:42.254
# Can't tell, but see #

47:44.628 --> 47:51.192
# If you are true to me #

47:52.903 --> 47:56.964
# So remember #

47:57.007 --> 48:02.707
# When you tell those little white lies #

48:02.746 --> 48:13.179
# That the night
has a thousand eyes #

48:16.293 --> 48:20.627
# A thousand eyes #

48:27.304 --> 48:30.831
Tonight's experiment shall be conducted
in the following locations.

48:30.874 --> 48:35.277
The first subject
shall be imprinted here on Avenue M.

48:35.312 --> 48:37.837
Mr. Book. There is a problem.

48:37.881 --> 48:41.214
There is no Avenue M.
We were unable to complete it.

48:41.251 --> 48:44.982
During the last tuning
we detected a lack of control.

48:45.022 --> 48:47.684
An opposing influence
on the machines?

48:47.724 --> 48:52.457
Then this man Murdoch
is more powerful than we thought.

48:52.496 --> 48:54.259
He's becoming like us.

48:54.298 --> 48:58.860
So we must become like him.

48:58.902 --> 49:01.336
The good doctor
has done as we asked?

49:01.371 --> 49:04.636
The life and times
of John Murdoch, Volume 2.

49:07.010 --> 49:09.342
We must not do this.

49:09.379 --> 49:12.906
Murdoch does not possess
these memories, yes?

49:12.950 --> 49:15.612
How will his imprint
allow us to find him?

49:15.652 --> 49:17.984
Everywhere he goes...

49:18.021 --> 49:20.649
everyone he seeks out
will be known to us.

49:20.691 --> 49:25.685
And as he follows the clues,
so shall we follow the memories.

49:25.729 --> 49:28.391
Perhaps we have forgotten
what happened last time, when we t...

49:28.432 --> 49:31.560
Yes. Poor, poor Mr...

49:31.601 --> 49:33.466
We have not forgotten.

49:33.503 --> 49:40.773
If Mr. Hand wishes to make this sacrifice
for the greater good...

49:41.378 --> 49:42.845
so be it.

49:42.879 --> 49:48.078
But to imprint one of us.
Failure has always resulted.

49:48.118 --> 49:51.645
What Mr. Hand proposes
is our only option.

49:51.688 --> 49:53.121
Imprint.

49:58.795 --> 50:00.558
This may sting a bit.

50:37.401 --> 50:39.301
Is it done?

50:40.037 --> 50:42.562
Oh, yes, Mr. Book.

50:43.507 --> 50:47.034
I have John Murdoch... in mind.

50:51.815 --> 50:53.009
"Johnny...

50:53.750 --> 50:57.208
"I found this postcard
among your mother's things.

50:57.254 --> 50:59.381
"Brings back memories,
doesn't it?

50:59.423 --> 51:01.288
"Stop by sometime.

51:01.324 --> 51:03.121
"We'll see if we
can't hook ourselves...

51:03.160 --> 51:04.491
"another mermaid.

51:04.528 --> 51:06.496
"Love to Emma. Karl."

51:12.369 --> 51:13.927
Karl.

51:15.205 --> 51:16.934
Karl Harris.

51:25.248 --> 51:26.613
Harris.

51:27.084 --> 51:28.551
Harris.

51:30.787 --> 51:32.687
"Harris Karl."

51:34.624 --> 51:37.491
Excuse me. Can you tell
me the way to Avenue C?

51:37.527 --> 51:38.721
Try the subway.

51:42.732 --> 51:44.290
You got a problem, pal?

51:44.334 --> 51:47.269
You been working here long?

51:48.338 --> 51:51.637
25 years. No days off
for good behavior.

52:16.766 --> 52:19.929
We're looking for John Murdoch.

52:53.904 --> 52:55.997
She knows nothing, Mr. Hand.

52:56.039 --> 52:58.166
A dead end, yes, Mr. Wall.

52:58.208 --> 53:00.802
We thought his imprint would
allow us to track him, yes...

53:00.844 --> 53:03.278
but instead we have
been brought here.

53:03.313 --> 53:04.940
This is irrational.

53:04.981 --> 53:07.313
Instincts are irrational, Mr. Wall...

53:07.350 --> 53:10.786
and we must follow
where they lead, yes.

53:10.820 --> 53:15.314
Mr. Sleep suggests he may go
to places familiar... his job.

53:15.358 --> 53:17.417
He does not care about our job.

53:17.460 --> 53:20.293
Indulge us, Mr. Hand.

53:20.330 --> 53:21.957
If you were Murdoch...

53:21.998 --> 53:22.987
Yes.

53:23.033 --> 53:24.967
If...

53:25.001 --> 53:26.559
I were Murdoch...

53:28.205 --> 53:30.105
I would remember...

53:30.140 --> 53:33.701
how my wife had hurt me
by sleeping with another man.

53:35.278 --> 53:36.745
And then...

53:38.481 --> 53:41.973
I would look for a way
to hurt her in return.

53:45.655 --> 53:48.021
Leave me alone with her.

53:48.058 --> 53:49.821
There's work to be done.

53:53.330 --> 53:55.628
All change, platform 3.

53:55.665 --> 53:58.498
Platform 3, all change.

53:58.535 --> 54:00.230
All change? Excuse me.

54:00.270 --> 54:01.601
How do I get to the end of the line?

54:01.638 --> 54:03.196
You want the Express.

54:10.947 --> 54:14.212
No trains leave on platform 7.

54:14.251 --> 54:15.650
- You want platform 2.
- Got it. Thanks a lot.

54:15.685 --> 54:16.674
Hey!

54:16.720 --> 54:18.187
How come that train didn't stop?

54:18.221 --> 54:19.711
That's the Express.

54:21.057 --> 54:22.991
There's no way out, you know?

54:23.026 --> 54:25.927
You can't get out of the city.
Believe me, I've tried.

54:26.997 --> 54:28.658
You're Murdoch, aren't you?

54:29.132 --> 54:30.895
The one they've been looking for.

54:30.934 --> 54:32.765
- Who are you?
- Used to be a cop.

54:33.470 --> 54:35.938
At least, in this life, I was.

54:36.339 --> 54:38.432
They steal people's
memories, you know?

54:38.975 --> 54:40.806
Then they swap them around
between us.

54:40.844 --> 54:43.540
I've seen them do it.
Back and forth, back and forth...

54:43.580 --> 54:45.673
till no one knows
who they are anymore.

54:45.715 --> 54:46.977
How do you know all this?

54:47.017 --> 54:51.351
Once in a while, one of us wakes up
while they're changing things.

54:51.388 --> 54:53.618
It's not supposed to happen,
but it does.

54:53.657 --> 54:55.682
It happened to me.

54:55.725 --> 54:57.625
They'll come looking for you, Murdoch.

54:58.762 --> 55:00.389
Just like they'll come looking for me.

55:01.231 --> 55:02.528
But that's OK.

55:02.565 --> 55:04.032
I figured a way out.

55:15.445 --> 55:16.776
They were here.

55:18.648 --> 55:19.945
Last night.

55:19.983 --> 55:22.281
This was to be his home.

55:25.021 --> 55:26.886
That was when we loved her.

55:26.923 --> 55:28.788
This is all well and good, Mr. Hand...

55:28.825 --> 55:33.319
But we require a more practical link
to his present whereabouts.

55:35.999 --> 55:37.227
Yes.

55:38.501 --> 55:40.833
And I know where to find her.

55:48.678 --> 55:51.613
We're very lucky,
when you think about it.

55:51.648 --> 55:52.637
I'm sorry?

55:52.682 --> 55:56.948
To be able to revisit those places
which have meant so very much to us.

55:57.754 --> 55:59.847
I thought it was more
that we were haunted by them.

55:59.889 --> 56:01.880
Perhaps.

56:03.493 --> 56:05.620
But imagine a life...

56:05.662 --> 56:08.290
alien to yours...

56:08.331 --> 56:10.026
in which your memories
were not your own...

56:10.066 --> 56:13.627
but those shared
by every other of your kind.

56:14.371 --> 56:18.671
Imagine the torment
of such an existence...

56:18.708 --> 56:21.176
no experiences to call your own.

56:23.813 --> 56:26.043
If it was all you knew...

56:26.082 --> 56:27.811
maybe it would be a comfort.

56:28.485 --> 56:31.181
But if you were to discover
something different...

56:32.422 --> 56:34.788
Something... better.

56:38.895 --> 56:41.523
There used to be a ferry
when I was a boy.

56:41.564 --> 56:43.327
Biggest thing you ever saw.

56:43.366 --> 56:46.494
Lit up like a floating birthday cake.

56:47.737 --> 56:50.001
That's just what my husband
once said to me...

56:50.039 --> 56:51.870
on this very spot.

56:53.209 --> 56:55.074
Where is your husband now?

56:55.111 --> 56:58.603
I wish I knew.
What brings you here?

56:59.416 --> 57:02.317
I met my wife at this place.

57:02.352 --> 57:04.149
It's where I first met my husband.

57:04.187 --> 57:06.417
Small world.

57:29.412 --> 57:30.606
No, no, no.

58:00.343 --> 58:01.776
Hello?

58:02.479 --> 58:03.639
Hello?

58:48.858 --> 58:50.189
What are you doing here?

58:50.226 --> 58:52.126
I've been following you.

58:55.999 --> 58:57.830
Hold it right there!

58:59.903 --> 59:01.302
Johnny?

59:01.738 --> 59:03.501
Johnny!

59:03.540 --> 59:04.802
It's been so damn long...

59:04.841 --> 59:07.674
I thought you'd forgotten
your Uncle Karl.

59:08.444 --> 59:10.241
You son of a gun!

59:13.316 --> 59:14.783
Uncle Karl?

59:18.288 --> 59:19.414
Wait.

59:21.558 --> 59:23.082
Is that me?

59:23.126 --> 59:24.320
Yeah.

59:33.369 --> 59:35.394
Shell Beach is where I grew up?

59:35.438 --> 59:36.598
That's what I said.

59:36.639 --> 59:39.005
Shell Beach, your hometown.

59:39.042 --> 59:42.239
I need to get there, Karl.
How do I get there?

59:42.278 --> 59:43.905
I don't know.

59:43.947 --> 59:47.007
- I haven't been there in years.
- Come on. You must remember.

59:47.050 --> 59:49.075
You gotta have some idea.

59:49.118 --> 59:50.016
Come on!

59:50.687 --> 59:51.915
Sorry, Johnny.

59:53.389 --> 59:56.290
The old cracker barrel
ain't what it used to be.

59:59.862 --> 01:00:01.489
So bright there.

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:03.795
Brighter times, I guess.

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:07.901
You were always scribbling
in that damn book.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:11.066
That's me and your pa.

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:13.268
What a couple of handsome fools.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:15.604
What happened to my parents?

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:21.744
Where are they now?

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:24.710
They're dead, Johnny.

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:27.188
They died when their house
burnt down.

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:28.884
I looked after you.

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:31.793
You don't remember that, really?

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:36.463
What's that?

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:38.900
What is that?

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:45.301
It's a scar.

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:47.935
You burnt your arm
pretty bad in the fire.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:56.782
- What does it mean, Johnny?
- It means these are all lies!

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:02.658
Why are you here, Mrs. Murdoch?

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:14.269
My husband told me
he'd been here.

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:20.371
He told me he wanted
to test himself...

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.943
see if he was...

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.948
capable of...

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:38.958
I wanted to talk to her. I thought maybe
she could help me find him.

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:42.597
Stay here.
I'm gonna call the station.

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:59.074
Yeah, this is Bumstead. Send the
homicide coroner to 1440... East, yeah.

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:02.179
There's been another one.

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:05.415
It's the same pattern.
I'll explain when you get here.

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:17.426
Oh, God.

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.662
It's OK. I won't hurt you.

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:21.593
It's OK.

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:33.682
Where the hell did she come from?

01:02:33.716 --> 01:02:35.206
I found her hiding.

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.783
She saw what happened here.

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:07.907
Are you ready to go home,
Mrs. Murdoch?

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.612
The inspector is gonna take me. Thanks.

01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:36.773
It's beautiful.

01:03:39.348 --> 01:03:42.647
It was a gift from my mother.

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:45.210
She died recently.

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:47.552
I keep it with me
to remind me of her.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:50.857
I'm sorry.

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:56.458
It's a funny thing, though.

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.865
I can't remember
when she gave it to me.

01:04:01.437 --> 01:04:04.429
How do you think I could
forget a thing like that?

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:10.773
Do you think about the past much,
Mrs. Murdoch?

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:15.713
What's happening, Inspector?

01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:18.447
I'm not sure I know anymore.

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:24.516
I left your old room like it was.

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:26.687
You can sleep here tonight, huh?

01:04:26.762 --> 01:04:29.060
Glad to have you back, Johnny...

01:04:29.098 --> 01:04:30.793
even if it is for just a night.

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:31.822
Karl.

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:34.197
Is that the right time?

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:38.139
Why, sure. That clock's
kept perfect time since I bought it.

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:39.971
A.m. Or p.m.?

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:42.577
What do you think, Johnny?

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.603
I don't understand.
How can it be night already?

01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:46.342
What happened to the day?
How'd I miss it?

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:49.249
You're tired. Anything's possible.

01:04:49.285 --> 01:04:50.684
Look...

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.281
get some sleep. We'll straighten
all this out tomorrow.

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:23.050
<i>"Guide to Shell Beach</i>
by Johnny Murdoch.<i>"</i>

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:27.853
Oh, come on.

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:48.843
- Hello?
- Emma, he's here.

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:51.005
He's acting mighty peculiar.

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:53.106
I know. He's not himself.

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:55.083
Keep him there,
and I'll be right over.

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:57.449
- I'll try.
- Thanks, Karl. Bye.

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:01.081
Johnny.

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:02.988
I can't promise anything,
Mrs. Murdoch.

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:04.583
We just have to play it as it comes.

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:08.119
Johnny, we just wanted to help.

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.905
Karl.

01:06:16.939 --> 01:06:18.338
Uncle Karl.

01:06:18.374 --> 01:06:22.071
Johnny, if you're in some kind of trouble...
well, maybe we could do something.

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:26.014
Haven't seen you in so long.

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:27.940
Yes.

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:45.993
Mr. Murdoch... you've been
the cause of much distress.

01:07:50.032 --> 01:07:52.466
- Start talking.
- There's no need for this.

01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:53.866
There's no escape.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:55.894
The city's ours. We made it.

01:07:55.938 --> 01:07:57.428
What are you talking about?

01:07:57.473 --> 01:08:00.670
We fashioned this city
on stolen memories...

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:04.543
different eras, different pasts
all rolled into one.

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.071
Each night, we revise it, refine it...

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:08.606
in order to learn.

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:10.050
Learn what?

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.553
About you, Mr. Murdoch...

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:13.851
you and your fellow inhabitants...

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:15.686
what makes you human.

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:19.251
- Why?!
- We need to be like you.

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:22.595
I understand you now, Mr. Murdoch.

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:26.192
I remember that which you do not...
what you've been missing.

01:08:26.234 --> 01:08:27.895
The ocean, yes...

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.566
running along the waves as a child...

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:36.544
meeting Emma at the river...
That first kiss that followed.

01:08:37.145 --> 01:08:38.305
What are you?

01:08:38.346 --> 01:08:40.109
You've seen what we are.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:43.084
We use your dead as vessels.

01:10:52.781 --> 01:10:53.770
Get in!

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:11.756
What about her? Ring any bells?

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.131
She was alive when I left her.

01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:14.260
What about this?

01:11:14.303 --> 01:11:16.328
This is nothing. This is...

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:18.670
It must mean something,
all those pictures.

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:19.867
What pictures?

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:21.900
I don't understand this.

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:24.777
Stop playing games with me, Murdoch!
Stop telling me lies!

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:26.303
I am not telling you lies!

01:11:26.348 --> 01:11:28.748
Help me out here.
Make me understand.

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.877
I have this jigsaw puzzle
in front of my face...

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:33.911
and every time I try to rearrange
the pieces, it still doesn't make any sense.

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:35.321
You think it makes sense to me?

01:11:35.357 --> 01:11:37.416
I'm as much in the dark here
as you are.

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:39.620
You let me ask you a question?

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:42.128
You heard of a place
called Shell Beach?

01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:44.655
- Sure.
- You know how to get there?

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.133
- Yeah.
- You tell me?

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:50.298
All right. You just...
You go to the...

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:52.264
Where? Where do you go?

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:54.401
Just give me a second, will ya?

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:58.239
You can't remember, can you?

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:01.982
You think that's kind of odd?

01:12:04.019 --> 01:12:05.008
Wait.

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:06.453
I got a better one for you.

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:07.785
When was the last time...

01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:10.690
you remember doing
something during the day?

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:11.818
What do you mean?

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:14.124
I just mean... during the day.

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:16.190
Daylight.

01:12:16.231 --> 01:12:17.789
When was the last time
you remember seeing it?

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:21.599
And I'm not talking about some distant,
half-forgotten childhood memory.

01:12:21.637 --> 01:12:24.765
I mean like yesterday?
Last week? When?

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:27.207
Can you come up
with a single memory?

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:30.006
You can't, can you?

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:33.310
You know something?
I don't think the sun even...

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:36.045
exists... in this place.

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:40.317
'Cause I've been up for hours and hours
and hours and the night never ends here.

01:12:41.123 --> 01:12:43.751
- That is crazy.
- You're damn right this is crazy.

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:46.158
Listen to me, Bumstead.
It's not just me.

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:48.220
It's all of us.

01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:49.821
They're doing something to all of us.

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:52.629
- Shut up, I've heard enough.
- Please listen.

01:12:52.668 --> 01:12:54.397
- Shut up, will ya! Shut up!
- Listen to me.

01:13:04.646 --> 01:13:07.911
There has to be an explanation
for this somewhere.

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:17.389
Explain this.

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:40.208
John, I'm so sorry.

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:43.014
I never meant to hurt you, John...

01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:44.177
and I did it,
and I don't know why I did.

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:46.380
I wish I could take it all back.

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:48.947
No. Emma... You didn't do it.

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:51.755
This... affair of yours,
whatever it is...

01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:53.421
the thing you're
supposed to have done...

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:55.327
you didn't do it.
I don't believe it ever happened.

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:56.763
What do you mean?

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:59.165
I know this is gonna sound crazy...

01:13:59.201 --> 01:14:02.102
but what if we never
knew each other before now?

01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:04.571
What if the first time we ever met...

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:08.440
was last night in your...
in our apartment...

01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:11.412
and everything you remember...

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:14.280
and everything that I'm supposed
to remember never really happened?

01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:16.910
Someone just wants us to think it did.

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.456
You know, back in the apartment...

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:27.694
I suddenly felt like
I didn't know you at all.

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:31.989
It was as if you were a stranger.

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:35.998
But how can that be true?

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:40.735
I so vividly remember meeting you.

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:43.802
I remember falling in love with you.

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:46.443
I remember losing you.

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:47.839
Time's up.

01:14:49.184 --> 01:14:50.674
No, wait, wait.

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:52.846
Please, just...

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:53.980
just one more minute.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.623
I love you, John.

01:15:05.467 --> 01:15:08.163
You can't fake something like that.

01:15:09.137 --> 01:15:10.468
No, you can't.

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:42.562
Inspector? Sir?

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:46.532
Detective Walenski
killed himself last night.

01:15:46.575 --> 01:15:50.341
I... kind of thought
you should know.

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:55.643
Oh, and...
the chief wanted to see you.

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:57.978
Sir...

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:06.050
I knew you'd track the killer down, sir.

01:16:18.774 --> 01:16:19.763
Sir...

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:22.734
shoelace.

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:37.151
How can we help you, sir?

01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:39.558
You can sleep.

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:42.686
Gentlemen...

01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:44.289
Sleep. Sleep.

01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:49.198
Evening, sir.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.138
Bumstead.

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:05.579
I wanted to be the first
to congratulate you... about the case.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:11.088
Take us to Murdoch.

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:12.218
Sleep.

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:41.220
Dr. Schreber.

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:44.154
I knew you'd come eventually.

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:46.888
Don't you think it's about time
you started giving me some answers?

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:49.123
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:50.893
Won't you please sit down?

01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:56.027
I come here quite often.

01:17:56.071 --> 01:17:58.539
It's one of the few places
I'm allowed a moment's peace.

01:17:58.573 --> 01:18:01.940
You see,
they have an aversion to water.

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:05.045
One could almost call it a phobia.

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:08.879
Who are they?
What do they want from me?

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:10.475
Right.

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:12.578
Well, for now, let's just say...

01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:15.317
that you were the subject
of their experiment.

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:16.722
We all are.

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:20.961
You're not crazy, John.

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:23.459
And you are not a murderer.

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.163
I'm sorry about this. I truly am.

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:28.726
But we do not have much time...

01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:31.398
and I cannot afford the luxury
of doing this the right way.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.964
Everything you need to know...

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:35.340
all the answers
are in this syringe.

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:36.571
I need you to inject yourself.

01:18:36.611 --> 01:18:39.011
It's the only way to
make you understand.

01:18:39.047 --> 01:18:40.344
You're kidding me, right?

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:43.351
We're running out of time, John.
You have to do this now.

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:45.419
Give me the gun, Doctor.

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:47.888
Inspector, he is more
disturbed than we thought.

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:50.653
I may not be the judge of personality
that you are, Doctor...

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:53.661
but you're the one
who looks disturbed to me.

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.360
You do not know
what you are doing.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:19:01.161
What, exactly is in this... Doctor?

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:05.099
All the answers you've
been looking for, John.

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.232
I swear to you.

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:12.839
Guess I'll just have to
hold on to it for... safekeeping.

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:14.075
If you don't mind.

01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:15.481
Let's go, Doctor.

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:22.188
- Go? Where are we going?
- Shell Beach.

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:25.591
That's where you want to go, isn't it?

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:27.219
The ocean.

01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:37.761
Why are you doing this?

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:41.101
What do you hope to gain by helping me?

01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:42.701
The truth.

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:46.447
None of these maps extend far enough
to show the ocean.

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:47.880
You won't find anything there...

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:49.850
I promise you!
I've been there, and...

01:19:49.885 --> 01:19:52.410
If you've been there,
you can show us the way, then, can't you?

01:19:53.555 --> 01:19:55.113
We'll see for ourselves.

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:57.215
I won't.

01:19:58.393 --> 01:20:01.123
I refuse.
You can't make me go there!

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:15.536
You were saying, doctor?

01:20:27.289 --> 01:20:30.816
I don't understand.
Used to be a bridge here.

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:39.158
Try that again,
your friends are gonna be...

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:40.532
fishing you out of the canal.

01:20:40.569 --> 01:20:41.968
Just don't hurt me.
I'll tell you everything.

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:44.028
It doesn't matter anymore anyway.

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:52.139
What?

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:57.181
Who are you people?

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:05.850
We will give you some more
pretty things soon... Anna.

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:07.522
I'm not Anna.

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:11.297
You will be soon, yes.

01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:18.237
I have another use for her first.

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:30.179
First there was darkness.
Then came the strangers.

01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:34.652
They abducted us
and brought us here.

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:38.688
This city, everyone in it...

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.092
is their experiment.

01:21:40.128 --> 01:21:43.029
They mix and match
our memories as they see fit...

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:45.828
trying to divine
what makes us unique.

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:49.298
One day, a man
might be an inspector.

01:21:49.337 --> 01:21:52.238
The next, someone entirely different.

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:55.573
When they want to
study a murderer for instance...

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:59.444
they simply imprint one of their citizens
with a new personality...

01:22:00.548 --> 01:22:04.575
arrange a family for him,
friends, an entire history...

01:22:05.387 --> 01:22:06.411
even a lost wallet.

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:08.683
Then they observe the results.

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:14.221
Will a man, given the history
of a killer, continue in that vein?

01:22:14.262 --> 01:22:18.255
Or are we, in fact, more
than the mere sum of our memories?

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:23.294
This business of you being a killer
was an unhappy coincidence.

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:26.205
You have had dozens
of lives before now.

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:29.574
You just happened to wake up
while I was imprinting you with this one.

01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:32.472
Why are they doing all of this?

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:35.915
It is our capacity for individuality...

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:38.511
our souls that makes
us different from them.

01:22:38.553 --> 01:22:40.919
They think they
can find the human soul...

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:44.084
if they understand
how our memories work.

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:45.387
All they have
are collective memories.

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:48.260
They share one group mind.

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:49.763
They're dying, you see?

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:53.234
Their entire race
is on the brink of extinction.

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:55.133
They think we can save them.

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:57.604
- Where do I fit in?
- You are different, John.

01:22:58.239 --> 01:23:01.072
You resisted my attempt
to imprint you.

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:09.115
Somehow you have developed
their ability to tune.

01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:10.447
That is how they change things.

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:12.009
That is how they built this city.

01:23:12.053 --> 01:23:14.954
They have machines buried deep
beneath the surface...

01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:18.926
that allow them
to focus their telepathic energies.

01:23:19.794 --> 01:23:22.285
They control everything here,
even the sun.

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:25.663
That's why it's always dark.
They can't stand the light.

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:26.962
So why do they need you?

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:31.405
When they first brought us here,
they extracted what was in us.

01:23:31.439 --> 01:23:35.273
So they could store the information,
remix it like so much paint...

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:37.835
and give us back new memories
of their choosing.

01:23:37.879 --> 01:23:41.508
But they still needed an artist
to help them.

01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:46.514
I understood the intricacies
of the human mind...

01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:49.079
better than they ever could...

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:51.854
so they allowed me
to keep my skills as a scientist...

01:23:51.893 --> 01:23:53.326
because they needed them.

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:55.829
But they made me
delete everything else.

01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:07.038
Can you imagine what
it is like being forced...

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:08.804
to erase your own past?

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:12.176
What about my past?
What about my childhood?

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:15.777
Shell Beach, Uncle Karl.

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:17.848
What about this?

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:20.653
This was blank when I found it!

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:22.713
You still don't understand, John.

01:24:22.757 --> 01:24:25.954
You were never a boy...
not in this place.

01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:28.792
Your entire history is an illusion,
a fabrication...

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:30.695
as it is with all of us.

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:33.223
You made those drawings
happen with your gift.

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:35.133
You say they brought us here.

01:24:36.938 --> 01:24:38.098
From where?

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:42.934
I'm sorry.

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:45.842
I don't remember.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.609
None of us remember that...

01:24:48.316 --> 01:24:49.908
what we once were...

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:52.385
what we might have been...

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:53.785
somewhere else.

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:13.240
I've taken you this far.

01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:15.401
You don't need me anymore.

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:17.240
Let's go.

01:25:35.463 --> 01:25:37.260
John.

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:04.154
There is no ocean, John.

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:08.322
There is nothing beyond the city.

01:26:08.363 --> 01:26:11.696
The only place home exists...

01:26:13.535 --> 01:26:15.526
is in your head.

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:25.608
No! No!

01:26:25.647 --> 01:26:27.478
John, stop!

01:26:30.051 --> 01:26:31.177
No!

01:26:33.888 --> 01:26:35.185
Stop!

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.056
Please!

01:26:42.897 --> 01:26:44.091
No!

01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:04.745
And now you know the truth.

01:27:24.105 --> 01:27:25.367
No!

01:28:13.388 --> 01:28:16.289
You'll allow yourself
to surrender, Mr. Murdoch...

01:28:16.324 --> 01:28:18.554
or it will result in
this one's death, yes?

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:21.118
What do I care?
She's not my real wife!

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:22.288
She's nothing to me!

01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:26.562
But you do still care,
don't you, Mr. Murdoch?

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:29.263
You see, I have
become the monster...

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:31.295
you were intended to be.

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:37.009
Shall I end her life now
as you would have?

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:42.278
Don't hurt her, please!

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:46.947
Then surrender, Mr. Murdoch.

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:48.615
Sleep.

01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:52.653
Now.

01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:56.156
John?

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:12.339
Sleep.

01:29:34.235 --> 01:29:37.068
The doctor was right.
He has evolved.

01:29:37.438 --> 01:29:38.962
Kill him.

01:29:39.006 --> 01:29:40.667
Kill him!
Kill him!

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:47.509
Kill him! Kill him!

01:29:50.184 --> 01:29:52.709
He is powerful, yes.

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:57.214
Dangerous. But he can also
lead us to what we seek.

01:29:57.258 --> 01:30:00.659
What the doctor calls the soul.

01:30:00.695 --> 01:30:04.392
It is time for our experiment
to move into a final phase.

01:30:04.432 --> 01:30:07.162
We no longer need
the other subjects.

01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:10.830
The time for study is over.

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:15.070
It is time to be one
with John Murdoch.

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:23.580
It is time, Doctor.

01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:25.176
Imprint.

01:30:27.955 --> 01:30:30.719
Shut it down!

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:33.921
Shut it down forever!

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:50.073
What are you doing?

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:54.639
They want to imprint you
with their own collective memories.

01:30:55.983 --> 01:31:00.113
They want to make you one of them,
so they can share your soul.

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.592
Imprint, Doctor.
No more disobedience.

01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:10.460
I'm sorry, John.

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:13.490
The pain will only last a moment.

01:31:15.636 --> 01:31:16.603
No!

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:26.309
Remember, John.

01:31:27.582 --> 01:31:29.550
You'll rise to greater
heights than that, my boy.

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:31.347
One day when you're older,
you'll understand.

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.485
Remember.

01:31:35.556 --> 01:31:38.423
That's it, John.
Practice makes perfect.

01:31:38.459 --> 01:31:41.656
Now remember what I told you.
Never talk to strangers.

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:43.493
John, remember.

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:46.398
You're probably wondering why I keep
appearing in your memories.

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:48.959
It is because I have
inserted myself in them.

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:51.096
All of these memories
have been fabricated...

01:31:51.138 --> 01:31:52.833
to teach you about the strangers.

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:56.002
Give you a lifetime of knowledge
in a single syringe.

01:31:58.846 --> 01:32:01.212
You will survive, John.

01:32:01.249 --> 01:32:03.547
You will find strength
within yourself...

01:32:03.584 --> 01:32:05.552
and you will prevail.

01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:06.951
Remember.

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:08.711
Hi, Uncle Karl.

01:32:08.756 --> 01:32:09.745
Johnny!

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.853
You're getting the hang of it, John.

01:32:14.896 --> 01:32:16.955
Maybe one day
I'll be working for you.

01:32:17.765 --> 01:32:20.996
This is the machine the strangers use
to amplify their thoughts.

01:32:21.035 --> 01:32:22.900
The machine
that changes their world.

01:32:22.937 --> 01:32:24.495
You must take control of it.

01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:26.166
You must make the machine yours.

01:32:26.207 --> 01:32:28.334
I know you can beat them, John.

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:30.867
But you must concentrate.

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.172
Something's wrong.

01:32:42.823 --> 01:32:45.553
There is no time for romance, John.

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:47.925
The world can be what you make it.

01:32:47.962 --> 01:32:49.987
What have you done?

01:32:50.031 --> 01:32:52.556
You have the power
to make anything happen...

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.090
but you must act now!

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:40.453
I knew you could do it, John.

01:37:40.487 --> 01:37:42.512
You have their power now.

01:37:42.556 --> 01:37:44.421
You control their machines.

01:37:44.458 --> 01:37:45.857
Where's Emma?

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:49.427
She is not Emma anymore, John.

01:37:49.463 --> 01:37:50.862
She has been reimprinted.

01:37:50.898 --> 01:37:52.593
So give her back her memories.

01:37:52.633 --> 01:37:55.067
I can't. The facility
where the strangers...

01:37:55.102 --> 01:37:58.094
stored the memories
has been destroyed.

01:37:58.138 --> 01:38:00.299
I'm sorry.

01:38:00.341 --> 01:38:03.037
What are you going to do now, John?

01:38:04.745 --> 01:38:08.579
You told me I had
the power, didn't you?

01:38:08.983 --> 01:38:11.474
I can make these machines
do anything I want.

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.452
Make this world anything
I want it to be.

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:19.516
Just so long as I concentrate
hard enough.

01:39:44.378 --> 01:39:45.777
Where are you going?

01:39:48.716 --> 01:39:50.183
Shell Beach.

01:40:31.058 --> 01:40:32.457
- What's the fare?
- Quarter.

01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:39.688
Oh, please.

01:40:39.733 --> 01:40:42.258
- Oh, no...
- It's fine.

01:40:42.302 --> 01:40:43.701
- Thank you.
- OK.

01:41:23.911 --> 01:41:25.776
John...

01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:31.476
Been waiting for you, yes?

01:41:32.219 --> 01:41:33.379
What are you doing?

01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:36.787
I'm just making a few little changes
around here, is all.

01:41:36.824 --> 01:41:38.519
Are we sure that's what we want?

01:41:39.026 --> 01:41:41.460
I'm prepared to take my chances.

01:41:41.495 --> 01:41:43.053
I'm dying, John.

01:41:43.097 --> 01:41:45.998
Your imprint is not
agreeable with my kind.

01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:49.765
But I wanted to know
what it was like...

01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:52.605
how you feel.

01:41:52.639 --> 01:41:55.335
You know how I was
supposed to feel.

01:41:55.375 --> 01:41:59.175
That person isn't me.
Never was.

01:41:59.213 --> 01:42:02.944
You wanted to know what it was
about us that made us human.

01:42:04.318 --> 01:42:07.651
Well, you're not going
to find it... in here.

01:42:09.423 --> 01:42:12.017
You went looking
in the wrong place.

01:43:50.424 --> 01:43:52.324
It's so beautiful here.

01:43:57.664 --> 01:43:59.131
So bright.

01:44:05.038 --> 01:44:07.871
Do you know if Shell Beach
is around here?

01:44:07.908 --> 01:44:10.536
I think that's it just over there.

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:30.754
I'm headed that way myself.

01:44:32.699 --> 01:44:34.724
Would you like to join me?

01:44:36.903 --> 01:44:37.892
Sure.

01:44:43.610 --> 01:44:45.942
I'm Anna, by the way.

01:44:45.979 --> 01:44:48.243
- What's your name?
- John.

01:44:50.651 --> 01:44:52.118
John Murdoch.

01:49:40.674 --> 01:49:44.576
# When marimba rhythms
start to play #

01:49:44.611 --> 01:49:47.136
# Dance with me #

01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:49.774
# Make me sway #

01:49:49.816 --> 01:49:54.185
# Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore #

01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:56.279
# Hold me close #

01:49:56.323 --> 01:49:59.315
# Sway me more #

01:49:59.359 --> 01:50:03.489
# Like a flower
bending in the breeze #

01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:05.828
# Bend with me #

01:50:05.865 --> 01:50:08.834
# Sway with ease #

01:50:08.868 --> 01:50:13.168
# When we dance
you have a way with me #

01:50:13.206 --> 01:50:15.197
# Stay with me #

01:50:15.241 --> 01:50:18.108
# Sway with me #

01:50:18.144 --> 01:50:22.911
# Other dancers may be on the floor #

01:50:22.949 --> 01:50:27.648
# Dear, but my eyes will see only you #

01:50:27.687 --> 01:50:32.386
# Only you have that
magic technique #

01:50:32.425 --> 01:50:37.055
# When we sway I go weak #

01:50:37.097 --> 01:50:41.056
# I can hear the sound of violins #

01:50:41.101 --> 01:50:46.368
# Long before it begins #

01:50:46.406 --> 01:50:50.536
# Make me thrill
as only you know how #

01:50:50.577 --> 01:50:56.743
# Sway me smooth, sway me now #

01:50:56.783 --> 01:51:01.846
# Sway me now #

01:51:04.591 --> 01:51:07.958
# Sway me smooth #

01:51:13.566 --> 01:51:19.505
# Sway me now #

01:51:20.305 --> 01:51:26.445
