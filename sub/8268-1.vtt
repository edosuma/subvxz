<i>"Her nipples now so erect they
seemed to reach out for him.</i>

02:04.392 --> 02:08.020
<i>"Then in one quick movement, 
he took her full inside his mouth."</i>

02:08.095 --> 02:09.584
<i>Listen to this.</i>

02:19.636 --> 02:20.898
Hey, guys, wait for me.

02:21.970 --> 02:23.835
Hi, Sharon. Hi, Jan.

02:39.649 --> 02:41.617
Come on, hurry up.
We're gonna miss them.

02:41.684 --> 02:43.207
They're gonna be
dressed already. Come on!

02:43.285 --> 02:45.844
"Never had she wanted a man this much.

02:47.288 --> 02:49.915
"Her longing swelled
from deep inside her."

02:52.791 --> 02:55.258
Come on, Bubba, I
can't hold you forever!

03:02.465 --> 03:05.092
Come on, Bubba, we can't
hold you much longer!

03:10.237 --> 03:11.430
Okay.

03:14.506 --> 03:15.632
Bubba!

03:34.186 --> 03:36.085
Hey! Oh, Bubba.

03:39.456 --> 03:40.923
I got... I got one!

04:06.074 --> 04:09.201
That way. Move it, chump. That way!

04:09.276 --> 04:10.402
Move it. Move it.

04:10.477 --> 04:13.445
Come on, get over that way.
Move it, get over there.

04:14.614 --> 04:18.208
"She felt as if she'd been pierced to
the very soul by a bolt of lightning."

04:18.283 --> 04:19.543
Betsy, listen to this.

04:19.617 --> 04:22.813
"And then, just then, he
raised himself up above her

04:22.886 --> 04:25.046
"and plunged his fullness
into her waiting..."

04:25.120 --> 04:26.644
Can you believe this?

04:27.556 --> 04:30.183
Hello, Chrissie, darling.

04:31.124 --> 04:32.489
Betsy!

04:32.559 --> 04:33.685
Hi, Jordan.

04:35.728 --> 04:37.786
Is anything wrong?

04:37.862 --> 04:39.124
Wrong?

04:39.197 --> 04:40.686
Quick, she's going into the room.
- Not at all.

04:40.764 --> 04:42.891
I just can't get
dressed for the big event

04:42.966 --> 04:46.798
till my roommate finishes
ironing my blouse!

04:48.003 --> 04:49.993
Well, do you wanna
borrow something of mine?

04:50.070 --> 04:51.970
You can't be serious.

04:52.039 --> 04:54.973
I mean, that's very sweet of you,
Chrissie, but I couldn't possibly.

04:55.041 --> 04:58.476
Tell me, do you have any
of that gaudy nail polish?

04:58.544 --> 05:00.238
I wanna do my toes.

05:07.916 --> 05:10.544
I just don't feel dressed
till my toes are done.

05:10.618 --> 05:12.107
What's this color called?

05:12.185 --> 05:13.618
Naked pink.

05:27.563 --> 05:28.825
Look at her picture.

05:28.897 --> 05:30.591
Hey, Bubba, you all right?

05:33.667 --> 05:36.260
Thanks for the nail polish, Chrissie.

05:46.809 --> 05:47.798
Where you going?

05:47.877 --> 05:48.900
To the stables.

05:48.977 --> 05:53.208
She's given us so much horseshit,
it's only fair we give some back.

05:55.481 --> 05:57.505
Christine Ramsay makes me sick.

05:58.283 --> 06:00.876
If I have to spend one more
night watching her and Jim Green

06:00.952 --> 06:04.114
slobber all over each other,
I think I'm gonna scream.

06:04.588 --> 06:06.885
It sounds like maybe
you're a little jealous.

06:06.956 --> 06:07.945
Jealous?

06:08.390 --> 06:10.289
I could have Jim in a minute!

06:13.527 --> 06:15.461
That's some big horse.

06:15.529 --> 06:17.587
Oh, God. Excuse me.

06:17.663 --> 06:20.130
Oh, gross, Betsy, that stinks!

06:20.198 --> 06:21.597
It sure does.

06:21.666 --> 06:24.930
You've gotta let me light it.
You've gotta let me light it.

06:28.004 --> 06:31.438
Fire! Fire! Fire!

07:03.861 --> 07:06.124
This is embarrassing. Just try this.

07:06.296 --> 07:07.285
Here.

07:08.198 --> 07:09.687
Hi.

07:09.765 --> 07:11.062
Hi.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.559
Come on.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.494
Do you wanna dance?

07:20.705 --> 07:22.263
Do you wanna dance?

07:22.874 --> 07:23.862
No.

07:25.943 --> 07:27.409
Do you wanna dance?

07:37.917 --> 07:38.906
Hi.

08:07.270 --> 08:08.862
<i>Good evening.</i>

08:10.339 --> 08:11.328
Really!

08:13.341 --> 08:15.901
<i>For those of you who
do not know who I am,</i>

08:15.977 --> 08:19.843
<i>I am the headmistress here at
Cherryvale, Prudence Dutchbok.</i>

08:19.912 --> 08:21.880
Good old Miss Douchebag!

08:23.014 --> 08:27.643
<i>I would like to take this opportunity
to welcome some very special guests.</i>

08:27.718 --> 08:31.777
<i>The outstanding ladies of the
Cherryvale Building Committee.</i>

08:34.188 --> 08:35.621
A round of applause.

08:35.690 --> 08:40.820
<i>Largely due to their generosity,
we will soon have our new wing.</i>

08:45.229 --> 08:47.060
<i>I would also like to
welcome our neighbors,</i>

08:47.131 --> 08:50.065
<i>the young men from the
Freemount Academy for Men.</i>

08:54.736 --> 08:58.899
<i>And now, all you boys and girls
have a grand and glorious time.</i>

09:15.183 --> 09:18.345
Would it be like that?
Like in that book, I mean?

09:18.418 --> 09:20.886
Oh, no, of course not.

09:20.954 --> 09:22.045
It wouldn't?

09:22.121 --> 09:23.349
No, I mean, it would be.

09:23.422 --> 09:25.981
It would be just exactly like the book.

09:28.292 --> 09:32.819
Well, okay, then,
maybe we should try it.

09:32.895 --> 09:33.883
Really?

09:33.995 --> 09:36.690
Do you really wanna do it? All right!

09:39.033 --> 09:42.399
Look, Chris, this isn't something
you just jump into, you know?

09:42.469 --> 09:45.925
I mean, I wouldn't want you to do anything
you're not totally ready for or anything.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.527
What do you mean?

09:47.605 --> 09:49.936
Well, it's just that it's such
a big step and everything and...

09:50.006 --> 09:51.371
I love you, Jim.

09:54.910 --> 09:56.536
I love you, too, Chris.

09:58.345 --> 10:00.210
You're perfect, you know that?

10:00.280 --> 10:01.803
Yeah, I guess I am.

10:26.664 --> 10:30.121
I'm telling you. The closer
he gets the bigger it gets.

11:32.242 --> 11:35.176
Peter, this is Miss Birdie Fallmouth.

11:35.244 --> 11:36.336
Hello, Peter.

11:36.412 --> 11:39.471
And next is Christian, Miss Fallmouth.

11:39.548 --> 11:42.448
Aren't any of you young
gentlemen going to stand up?

11:42.516 --> 11:43.504
Your name?

11:43.583 --> 11:45.448
Oh, I'm Roy, ma'am.

11:45.518 --> 11:46.506
Hi, Roy.

11:46.585 --> 11:48.712
And this is Bubba Beauregard.

11:49.388 --> 11:51.287
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

12:08.733 --> 12:10.428
She's such a nothing.

12:10.502 --> 12:12.799
I absolutely don't understand
what he sees in her.

12:12.870 --> 12:15.303
I'd like to see you get
a guy as good as Jim.

12:15.371 --> 12:16.599
Why not Jim?

12:16.673 --> 12:19.197
You couldn't. He's in love with Chris.

12:19.274 --> 12:21.298
Chris is no competition.

12:21.375 --> 12:24.241
Tomorrow in riding class
I begin my campaign.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.843
Coach Whelan, may I see you a moment?

12:30.281 --> 12:32.908
I wonder if you would
keep an eye on our girls

12:32.983 --> 12:36.179
while I show the ladies the
drawings of the new wing?

12:36.285 --> 12:38.253
Certainly, Miss Dutchbok.
Good, good, good.

12:38.321 --> 12:41.551
Ladies? I think these drawings
will take your breath away.

12:46.226 --> 12:47.716
Young man!

12:48.460 --> 12:50.325
Illegal use of the hands.

12:52.196 --> 12:54.356
Right this way to my office, ladies.

13:12.844 --> 13:16.642
Hey, Douchebag's office.

13:17.981 --> 13:20.244
And the new wing.

13:20.315 --> 13:22.407
Douchebag Hall.

13:47.333 --> 13:50.699
I have to warn you, I like a lot of,

13:51.203 --> 13:54.365
whatchamacallit, foreplay.

13:57.841 --> 13:59.307
Is that enough?

13:59.375 --> 14:00.364
I guess so.

14:11.150 --> 14:16.279
And now, ladies, if you
will. My office. Come, please.

14:16.353 --> 14:21.084
The marvelous renderings of the new
wing, which in your generosity and...

14:31.764 --> 14:34.561
<i>Good morning, girls, and attention.</i>

14:34.866 --> 14:36.890
<i>This is Miss Dutchbok speaking.</i>

14:38.635 --> 14:42.229
<i>And you know the morning exercises...</i>

16:24.873 --> 16:26.602
Good afternoon, class.

16:27.708 --> 16:29.733
I know how much you've
been looking forward

16:29.810 --> 16:33.801
to today's lessons of the
mechanics of sexual intercourse.

16:41.952 --> 16:44.886
Too many people are
embarrassed or ashamed

16:44.954 --> 16:48.320
about the very natural
act of sexual intercourse.

16:48.390 --> 16:49.413
Come right in.

16:49.490 --> 16:51.583
Go right ahead with your
class, Miss Copuletta.

16:51.658 --> 16:53.716
We'll just stand here for a tiny moment.

16:53.793 --> 16:56.761
Yes, of course, Miss
Dutchbok. Thank you.

16:57.462 --> 17:01.329
Now then, during sexual intercourse,

17:01.399 --> 17:04.560
the male undergoes
certain biological changes

17:04.633 --> 17:06.964
which cause his organ to become erect.

17:07.036 --> 17:11.767
Now, after a short length of time, the
male organ releases its fertile cargo...

17:11.838 --> 17:15.704
Thank you very much, Miss
Copuletta. That was very stimulating.

17:15.775 --> 17:17.674
Come, ladies, let's
... Let's go to lunch.

17:17.742 --> 17:21.871
We have a lovely lunch in the
cafeteria. We're having chicken.

17:24.446 --> 17:26.142
Miss Copuletta?

17:26.681 --> 17:29.172
Which do you think is the
most important in a penis,

17:29.251 --> 17:30.877
length or width?

17:30.951 --> 17:34.818
Well, I don't think that we have
the time to get into that today.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.079
What, is she kidding?

17:38.424 --> 17:41.823
I mean, we don't have the
time today to talk about that.

17:42.359 --> 17:46.988
<i>Now, we are going to see a short film
called The Tadpole and His Community.</i>

17:47.862 --> 17:50.387
Rita, take care of the blinds, please.

17:56.569 --> 18:00.060
Hello, Hotel D'Amour? I'd
like to make a weekend, please.

18:00.138 --> 18:02.901
I mean, I'd like to reserve a
reservation for a weekend in your hotel.

18:02.973 --> 18:04.439
A week from Friday.

18:04.841 --> 18:07.866
It's Mrs. Christine Rams... Jones.

18:07.943 --> 18:09.500
No, not Rams-Jones, just Jones.

18:09.577 --> 18:11.977
What if they wanna see your
driver's license or something?

18:12.046 --> 18:15.503
Listen, it seems that I was wrong
about the name. It's not Jones, it's ...

18:15.582 --> 18:17.310
Should I use my name or his? Yours.

18:17.383 --> 18:19.441
Ramsay. Mrs. Christine... His. Use his!

18:19.517 --> 18:20.916
Green!

18:21.919 --> 18:24.683
Ramsay is my married name and
Green is my professional name.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.551
Jones was my mother's maiden name.

18:26.622 --> 18:28.885
But, I'm a graphic designer
and I really am married,

18:28.957 --> 18:31.356
so that's pretty much my story. Goodbye.

18:31.692 --> 18:33.159
How was I?

18:33.327 --> 18:34.315
Terrific.

19:29.232 --> 19:32.496
I made the reservation at the Hotel
D'Amour. The weekend after next.

19:32.567 --> 19:35.399
That's where my parents
stayed on their honeymoon.

19:36.436 --> 19:40.235
God, this is gonna be
wonderful. So perfect.

19:41.573 --> 19:42.971
Don't you think?

19:43.307 --> 19:44.296
Don't you?

19:44.909 --> 19:47.502
Of course I do. Why do you say that?

19:47.911 --> 19:50.845
It just seemed like you were
beginning to have some doubts.

19:50.913 --> 19:53.278
Me? Doubts? What, are you kidding me?

19:54.948 --> 19:57.814
Well, that's good, at least
one of us won't be nervous.

19:57.884 --> 20:00.375
Nervous? What's there
to be nervous about?

20:15.163 --> 20:17.858
Oh, oh, no! Oh! Do you see what I see?

20:17.931 --> 20:20.023
Jordan, dear.

20:47.450 --> 20:49.179
Surprise!

20:52.821 --> 20:54.481
Go get her, Bubba!

21:08.265 --> 21:11.563
That is the finest example of
bareback riding I've ever seen.

21:23.175 --> 21:24.232
I'll get them. I'll get them.

21:24.309 --> 21:26.834
No, really, I'll go in and buy them.

21:26.911 --> 21:29.640
But up till now you've done
everything. Now it's my turn, all right?

21:29.713 --> 21:30.804
Okay.

21:39.752 --> 21:42.811
I suppose I'd say, "I'd just
like to buy some condoms"?

21:43.088 --> 21:45.556
Well, be a little bit
more sophisticated.

21:45.657 --> 21:47.283
Sophisticated?

21:53.362 --> 21:54.920
Sophisticated?

22:04.436 --> 22:05.994
Yep, it is fabulous.

22:06.071 --> 22:08.766
It's called Fountain of Truth,
and you know what I'm gonna do?

22:08.839 --> 22:12.330
I'm just gonna do one half of your face
so you can see the incredible difference.

22:12.408 --> 22:15.376
It just relaxes those
years right off your face.

22:15.444 --> 22:19.140
Now let that dry for a few minutes
and I'll be right with you. Okay?

22:19.447 --> 22:21.676
Hello there, young fella! Hi.

22:21.748 --> 22:24.875
What can I do you for today?

22:24.950 --> 22:27.645
I'd like to buy some
prophylactic devices.

22:27.719 --> 22:29.310
Now that is what I like to hear.

22:29.386 --> 22:31.251
You know what they say,
"An ounce of prevention..."

22:31.321 --> 22:35.120
You know, most young people today
are too careless about their bodies.

22:35.190 --> 22:38.249
Well, what type of prophylaxis
did you have in mind?

22:38.826 --> 22:40.521
What... What, what type?

22:40.628 --> 22:42.720
Well, yeah, we have the ones
with the little rubber tip

22:42.795 --> 22:46.286
for getting in the hard-to-reach
areas, and we have the stimulators,

22:46.365 --> 22:48.264
and we have my personal favorite

22:48.332 --> 22:52.199
which possesses marvelous
prophylactic qualities.

22:52.269 --> 22:55.294
All you do is insert the tip
of a toothpick into the end

22:55.371 --> 22:58.703
and she's ready to work for you. Yep.

22:59.107 --> 23:01.802
And, of course, we also
carry the full line of flosses

23:01.875 --> 23:07.334
and picks and the bristle brushes
in the various degrees of stiffness.

23:07.579 --> 23:09.944
Did your dentist recommend
anything in particular?

23:10.014 --> 23:12.709
My dentist? Yep. Your dentist.

23:15.684 --> 23:17.049
Did you get them?

23:22.489 --> 23:24.081
What the hell is this stuff?

23:24.157 --> 23:27.387
He... He misunderstood me and
it was too much trouble to...

23:27.459 --> 23:28.891
I'll do it.

23:33.797 --> 23:35.263
Absolutely magnificent.

23:35.331 --> 23:37.298
And you can really feel
it working, can't you?

23:37.365 --> 23:40.060
You know what? Let's let
this little bit in here

23:40.134 --> 23:42.227
dry a little bit more and I'll
be with you in two seconds.

23:42.303 --> 23:44.133
Well, hello, young lady.

23:44.203 --> 23:46.137
What can I help you with today?

23:46.205 --> 23:47.728
I'd like to buy some condoms.

23:47.806 --> 23:49.205
Yeah. Well, let's see.

23:49.274 --> 23:50.865
We have these on sale this week.

23:50.941 --> 23:53.374
This is three dozen for
$5.99. I'll take them.

23:53.443 --> 23:54.933
However, I don't know if I'd trust them.

23:55.011 --> 23:56.739
They've been on the
shelf for quite some time.

23:56.812 --> 23:59.575
Now, we have this new product here.
These are multicolored and ribbed.

23:59.647 --> 24:00.909
Oh, that'll be just fine.

24:00.982 --> 24:02.141
No, I don't think so.

24:02.215 --> 24:05.012
I don't think you'd want
anything that tawdry, do you?

24:05.084 --> 24:07.847
No, no, or do you? No.

24:07.919 --> 24:10.444
No. No, what you want is
something really reliable, huh?

24:10.522 --> 24:11.681
Yeah. Yep.

24:11.755 --> 24:17.021
Well, I have sold literally miles and miles
of these and I've never had any complaints.

24:17.259 --> 24:19.989
Now, does he like them pre-lubricated?

24:20.528 --> 24:22.496
Your husband. These are for
your husband, aren't they?

24:22.563 --> 24:24.120
Yes, for my husband.

24:24.197 --> 24:27.529
They're definitely for my husband,
and we're both definitely married!

24:27.599 --> 24:29.589
And does he like them
pre-lubricated, then?

24:29.667 --> 24:31.828
Yeah, I'll take them.

24:36.105 --> 24:38.198
Get this stuff off my face!

24:39.274 --> 24:41.299
Miss Dutchbok. Good
afternoon, Miss Dutchbok.

24:41.376 --> 24:42.467
Good afternoon, Christine.

24:42.543 --> 24:44.568
You probably wonder what I'm
doing here... I don't really care!

24:44.645 --> 24:46.077
...buying these very
things for my father.

24:46.145 --> 24:48.305
Actually they're not
for my father, they're...

24:48.380 --> 24:50.814
Fine! But don't you have homework
to do back at school, Christine?

24:50.882 --> 24:52.348
Yes, I do. I do have lots of homework

24:52.416 --> 24:56.681
and I'll just be paying for these vitamins
here and going on my way. Thank you.

25:02.357 --> 25:04.847
You know, green really is your color.

25:08.661 --> 25:09.820
Hey, did you win one yet?

25:09.894 --> 25:12.760
So you're finally gonna get into
Chris' pants. I can't believe it.

25:12.830 --> 25:14.695
Hey, scumbag, don't talk
about Chris like that.

25:14.765 --> 25:17.961
Oh, our James doesn't approve of
your vocabulary, do you, James?

25:18.034 --> 25:20.194
No, he's right, Roy. I'm sorry, Jim.

25:20.268 --> 25:23.668
Perhaps I should've said, have
you given her a hot beef injection?

25:23.738 --> 25:26.001
You guys are animals! Get out of here!

25:26.639 --> 25:29.539
<i>Hey, big boy. Think you're
man enough to score with me?</i>

25:29.608 --> 25:31.200
Damn right! Hey, guys!

25:32.377 --> 25:34.367
<i>I have to be in bed early tonight.</i>

25:34.444 --> 25:36.844
Don't worry, honey, you will be.

25:36.913 --> 25:39.380
<i>Oh, don't touch me there! It's not fair!</i>

25:39.448 --> 25:41.506
Hey, Jim, I'm doing better than you.

25:41.583 --> 25:44.779
<i>Oh, oh, yes, yes.</i>

25:44.852 --> 25:47.615
I did it! I scored!
I got into her pants!

25:47.687 --> 25:50.416
Yeah, that's about as close as
you're ever gonna get to nookie.

25:50.489 --> 25:52.888
Hey, Mr. Big, I thought you
were gonna call Chrissie.

25:52.957 --> 25:55.982
You wouldn't want her to cancel
her de-virginization, would you?

25:56.059 --> 25:58.584
I'm sure not gonna call
her in front of you nerds.

25:58.661 --> 25:59.991
Oh, why not?

26:00.062 --> 26:05.021
Is Jimsie-wimsy afraid to talk his baby
talk in front of Roysy-woysy and Bubba-wubba?

26:05.099 --> 26:06.929
I'm not afraid to do anything.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.364
He's afraid. Mmm-hmm.

26:08.467 --> 26:11.765
Get off it! Well, if you're
not afraid, then call.

26:11.836 --> 26:15.430
Go ahead. Hey, here's a
dime. There's the phone. Call.

26:15.506 --> 26:16.973
Five bucks says you're chicken.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.303
Do you have five bucks?

26:19.375 --> 26:20.841
Go on.

26:22.210 --> 26:23.801
Well, go on, chicken.

26:30.416 --> 26:34.476
You guys make one sound, I'm gonna hang
up and beat the shit out of both of you.

26:45.659 --> 26:46.717
Hello?

26:46.794 --> 26:48.318
Chris, hi.

26:48.429 --> 26:49.918
Hi. Hi.

26:50.563 --> 26:51.927
Hi, Jim, what are you doing?

26:51.997 --> 26:53.555
You know, hanging out.

26:53.632 --> 26:55.064
Hanging out.

26:55.966 --> 26:57.263
<i>What are you doing?</i>

26:57.334 --> 26:58.527
Oh, I'm just sitting around.

26:59.035 --> 27:00.662
I've been thinking about you.

27:00.737 --> 27:02.328
<i>I've been thinking about you, too.</i>

27:02.404 --> 27:04.098
You have? What have you been thinking?

27:04.172 --> 27:07.163
This is great. I gotta take some of
this down so I can use it for myself.

27:07.240 --> 27:08.639
I've been thinking a
lot about our weekend.

27:08.708 --> 27:10.504
Oh, weekend.

27:11.377 --> 27:13.241
You have? What have you
been thinking about it?

27:13.311 --> 27:16.404
<i>Oh, lots of stuff. You know,
like how much fun it's gonna be.</i>

27:16.480 --> 27:18.380
<i>What else? How great it'll be.</i>

27:18.449 --> 27:19.779
Mmm-hmm. What else?

27:21.317 --> 27:23.250
<i>Well, lots of stuff like that.</i>

27:23.418 --> 27:25.612
<i>Do you still love me? Sure.</i>

27:25.686 --> 27:27.278
Well, then, let me hear you say it.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.718
<i>No, not right now.</i>

27:28.788 --> 27:29.982
Why not?

27:30.056 --> 27:32.148
<i>Because... Oh, come on,
let me hear you say it.</i>

27:32.224 --> 27:33.589
<i>No. Why not?</i>

27:33.659 --> 27:34.648
Because!

27:34.726 --> 27:36.283
Because you're afraid
to let anybody hear you.

27:36.360 --> 27:37.622
<i>No, that's not true.</i>

27:37.695 --> 27:38.683
Then say it.

27:39.796 --> 27:42.423
All right. I love you.

27:43.799 --> 27:46.096
And I love you, too, Jimbo.

27:50.204 --> 27:53.036
What happened? Jordan
was on the extension!

27:53.105 --> 27:54.901
Scumbags!

27:56.141 --> 27:58.108
I love you.

28:04.713 --> 28:07.772
<i>Hey, big boy, think you're
man enough to score with me?</i>

28:08.149 --> 28:10.082
I am if Bubba is.

28:10.417 --> 28:13.078
<i>Oops, sorry, tonight
I have to wash my hair.</i>

28:13.552 --> 28:15.644
What? Oh, Jim.

28:20.057 --> 28:22.957
Do you think I'm doing the
right thing, with Jim, I mean?

28:23.025 --> 28:25.117
I guess I'm kind of scared.

28:25.560 --> 28:28.392
Bets, have you ever really
done it, all the way?

28:28.462 --> 28:30.225
Well, yes and no.

28:30.297 --> 28:32.264
What do you mean, "Yes
and no"? Don't you know?

28:32.332 --> 28:35.789
Bubba says we did it once and that
it was very good for both of us.

28:35.868 --> 28:38.927
But I was passed out. I
don't remember a thing.

28:39.036 --> 28:42.766
Well, it's not gonna be like that
for me. What else does Bubba say?

28:42.838 --> 28:44.499
He says that I had three orgasms.

28:44.573 --> 28:49.474
That I begged him for mercy and that I
said I've never seen a man so well endowed.

28:49.710 --> 28:51.541
Well, is he? Is he what?

28:51.612 --> 28:53.704
Is he well endowed?

28:53.779 --> 28:55.076
I don't really know.

28:55.147 --> 28:58.774
I mean, not firsthand. Just
from what Bubba tells me.

28:59.550 --> 29:02.416
Jordan thinks that length is
most important, what do you think?

29:02.485 --> 29:05.976
I think width. Why width?

29:06.088 --> 29:08.055
Because Jordan thinks length.

29:39.944 --> 29:42.707
All right, girls, let's get a move
on. We're gonna be late for practice.

29:43.847 --> 29:45.211
Who slammed?

29:47.650 --> 29:49.617
Hey, Jordan, how's it going?

29:55.621 --> 29:59.317
Who slammed? Cut it
out with the slamming!

30:05.061 --> 30:07.051
Hut! Only a floater, Jim.

30:08.897 --> 30:11.364
We go deep, make a play.

30:11.432 --> 30:14.127
Okay. All right, let's see it.

30:14.200 --> 30:15.462
All right!

30:16.135 --> 30:19.331
First we're gonna give
them cheer number 69.

30:19.404 --> 30:20.928
"Rickety rackety."

30:21.005 --> 30:23.564
All right, girls? All right.

30:23.874 --> 30:25.238
What's so funny?

30:25.308 --> 30:27.708
Keep your eye on the coach and Rita.

30:27.777 --> 30:29.243
Why?

30:29.311 --> 30:32.609
Oh, I think we might be
seeing a little more of them.

30:32.680 --> 30:33.806
Okay.

30:33.881 --> 30:37.645
<i>Rickety rackety shanty town</i>

30:37.716 --> 30:41.014
<i>Who's gonna keep those Trojans down?</i>

30:41.085 --> 30:42.712
<i>Nobody, nobody, nobody</i>

30:55.195 --> 30:56.627
Oh, Bet!

31:02.232 --> 31:03.893
This is it!

31:05.702 --> 31:08.966
This is the last straw.

31:11.105 --> 31:15.803
I don't know which of you is
responsible for this shocking debacle!

31:15.875 --> 31:17.172
I don't care.

31:17.710 --> 31:20.769
You're all confined to
campus for the next week!

31:20.912 --> 31:23.107
But we... Silence!

31:24.648 --> 31:27.980
If you don't deserve
punishment, I'm sure each of you

31:28.050 --> 31:31.382
will think of something you have
done to deserve it in the past.

31:31.453 --> 31:32.749
Dismissed!

31:38.024 --> 31:42.186
But Miss Dutchbok, I didn't do
anything... Now, now, now, Jordan, dear,

31:42.393 --> 31:44.827
I'm doing this for your own good.

31:44.895 --> 31:47.522
You'll thank me for it in future years.

31:48.397 --> 31:50.092
Run along, dear.

31:53.401 --> 31:55.994
Coach Whelan, pull yourself together.

31:57.304 --> 31:58.998
Oh, dear.

32:07.143 --> 32:08.770
Here, drink this, it'll do you good.

32:08.845 --> 32:12.280
Oh, no, I couldn't
possibly. I don't drink.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.405
Alcohol is poison to the body.

32:14.482 --> 32:15.972
Oh, don't be silly.

32:16.049 --> 32:21.076
Consumed in moderation, alcohol
is perfectly harmless. Watch.

32:29.392 --> 32:31.121
There you are, dear. Mmm-hmm.

32:42.334 --> 32:43.528
See?

32:45.202 --> 32:48.932
I'll be back soon, Bertha, but
you stay here as long as you like.

32:49.005 --> 32:51.700
Very soon I will forget
all about this morning.

32:52.474 --> 32:53.633
Thank you, Miss Dutchbok.

32:53.708 --> 32:55.938
By tomorrow we'll have
forgotten all of this.

33:23.495 --> 33:25.359
Where'd you get all this stuff, anyway?

33:25.430 --> 33:27.727
My brother J.D. left it
to me when he graduated.

33:27.798 --> 33:29.561
Your brother?

33:30.599 --> 33:31.657
Get up!

33:38.372 --> 33:41.465
If we get caught, we're gonna get
expelled. I don't wanna get expelled.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.667
Look, you only go around once in life

33:43.742 --> 33:46.107
and you gotta grab for
all the nookie you can get.

33:46.177 --> 33:47.610
Guys.

34:07.324 --> 34:08.688
Smile.

34:11.893 --> 34:13.588
It's embarrassing. The girl's desperate,

34:13.661 --> 34:16.630
she's got the bathroom packed with
all these smelly and large things.

34:16.697 --> 34:18.790
And she does enough
pushups to make you look...

34:18.866 --> 34:20.856
I've got to get a new roommate.

34:21.301 --> 34:25.100
I think Betsy's room
is over here, darling.

34:43.181 --> 34:44.239
Hi.

34:44.315 --> 34:45.373
Hi. Hi.

34:45.449 --> 34:47.940
Sugar. I don't believe we've met.

34:48.018 --> 34:50.282
I'm Jordan Leigh-Jensen. Hi.

34:50.353 --> 34:52.344
Oh, we're unknown visitors here.

34:52.422 --> 34:55.447
My older sister's Christine Ramsay.

34:55.958 --> 34:57.390
Mine's Betsy Newhouse.

34:57.458 --> 35:00.051
Yes, there is a family resemblance.

35:00.127 --> 35:03.459
Well, your sister's
room is right in here.

35:06.431 --> 35:07.625
Bubba!

35:08.999 --> 35:10.466
But my sister!

35:10.534 --> 35:13.991
Your sister's at the library.
She'll be back any minute.

35:14.504 --> 35:18.871
Bubba, what are you doing here?

35:20.107 --> 35:22.006
But my sister.

35:24.610 --> 35:27.170
Make yourself at home.
Can I get you anything?

35:27.246 --> 35:29.770
No. Really, I don't wanna be any bother.

35:29.847 --> 35:34.544
Oh, don't be silly. You're no bother.

35:38.920 --> 35:41.012
Excuse me.

35:41.088 --> 35:46.786
Miss! Miss! Miss!

35:47.092 --> 35:52.051
You know, I'm so overheated.
These workouts really do me in.

35:52.762 --> 35:53.751
Mmm.

35:55.364 --> 35:56.353
Ah!

36:14.043 --> 36:15.442
Want some?

36:27.753 --> 36:29.015
Mmm!

36:30.121 --> 36:32.884
Well, I am feeling a little warm myself.

36:32.956 --> 36:34.685
Oh, I'll take care of that.

36:49.167 --> 36:54.762
You know, you seem like the kind of
girl that's had some experience with men.

36:56.206 --> 37:01.073
Tell me, can you see any reason
why men wouldn't like my legs?

37:05.679 --> 37:09.579
Well, what's wrong with me,
then? Why don't men go for me?

37:11.683 --> 37:13.013
Feel my calf.

37:13.717 --> 37:17.311
Go ahead, feel it. Go ahead, feel it.

37:19.788 --> 37:23.382
Well, what do you think?
Tight as a drum, right?

37:24.859 --> 37:27.383
No cellulite in the upper thighs, right?

37:31.529 --> 37:34.020
None that I can see. No.

37:34.197 --> 37:35.755
What is it, then?

37:35.832 --> 37:38.664
Why am I so unattractive to men?

37:39.235 --> 37:41.828
I know! My breasts!

37:45.239 --> 37:48.674
Would you call these breasts firm?

37:48.741 --> 37:50.640
Or do you think they're saggy?

37:50.709 --> 37:52.733
Firm. Definitely firm.

37:52.810 --> 37:56.540
Are you sure? Are you really sure?

37:57.380 --> 37:59.074
Why don't you feel them?

38:01.083 --> 38:02.674
Is something wrong?

38:02.750 --> 38:04.377
Wrong? Oh, no.

38:04.452 --> 38:06.919
It's just that it's so hot in here.

38:06.987 --> 38:09.420
Yeah, we have that problem
with the heat all the time.

38:09.488 --> 38:12.388
Let me see if I can make
it a little cooler for you.

38:27.100 --> 38:28.397
George Washington.

38:28.468 --> 38:30.230
So, what are we talking about?

38:32.137 --> 38:33.364
Good.

38:36.907 --> 38:39.807
Excuse me. I... I don't
suppose that you...

38:39.875 --> 38:41.604
I didn't think so.

38:46.380 --> 38:48.745
I'm just not in the
mood right now, Bubba.

38:48.814 --> 38:51.475
Not in the mood? You're not in the mood?

38:51.549 --> 38:55.211
I risked my life sneaking in to
see you and you're not in the mood?

38:55.286 --> 39:01.985
Okay, okay. But just remember,
I like a lot of foreplay.

39:03.225 --> 39:04.350
Great.

39:05.493 --> 39:06.517
Great.

39:06.594 --> 39:08.083
Go ahead and start without me.

39:08.161 --> 39:09.321
Where you going?

39:09.396 --> 39:10.919
Where am I going?

39:10.996 --> 39:14.021
I'm going to the bathroom,
of course, to have a smoke.

39:15.433 --> 39:18.959
In Europe, they smoke
before instead of after.

39:19.335 --> 39:21.030
It's the latest thing.

39:37.881 --> 39:41.008
Oh, I got a cramp. Help! Help!

39:42.918 --> 39:44.384
Help, help!

39:45.320 --> 39:48.880
Be a doll, will you? Grab
that bottle of love oil.

40:04.166 --> 40:05.360
Bubba?

40:21.978 --> 40:24.071
You sleazebag!

40:25.513 --> 40:28.106
Oh, hi there, Betsy. I was just...

40:28.182 --> 40:30.775
Yeah, I know that you
were just, you pervert!

40:45.427 --> 40:48.452
Oh, that feels so much better.

40:48.696 --> 40:52.061
There's just one spot
that's still a little tight.

40:52.531 --> 40:53.555
Here?

40:53.632 --> 40:55.121
Down just a little.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.326
Here?

40:56.401 --> 40:57.390
Lower.

40:58.335 --> 40:59.529
Here?

40:59.603 --> 41:00.592
Lower.

41:02.271 --> 41:03.329
Here?

41:35.894 --> 41:38.589
That's perfect.

41:42.899 --> 41:44.866
Let me turn over now so
you can do the other side.

41:44.933 --> 41:47.333
No! Jordan, I don't think I can do that!

41:47.403 --> 41:50.859
Oh, how thoughtless of me!
Your hands must be tired.

41:51.705 --> 41:53.070
I know, I'll massage you.

41:53.140 --> 41:54.731
No, no, Jordan!

41:54.807 --> 41:56.707
Yes? Please! I have
to tell you something.

41:56.776 --> 41:58.709
Yes? I'm not really a girl.

41:58.843 --> 42:01.402
Jordan! Jordan, please, don't scream!

42:03.079 --> 42:05.980
I never meant for this to
happen! Jim? Is that you?

42:07.282 --> 42:09.045
How could you deceive me?

42:09.517 --> 42:12.008
He snuck into my room
and took advantage of me!

42:12.086 --> 42:15.542
You tricked me into taking my clothes
off just so you could see me naked!

42:15.621 --> 42:16.781
Chris.

42:16.855 --> 42:18.981
What's going on? I don't know.

42:23.727 --> 42:25.887
I wonder what he was doing in there.

44:11.099 --> 44:12.691
What happened?

44:12.766 --> 44:15.462
It was unbelievable.

44:15.536 --> 44:18.026
Yeah, yeah, tell me, tell me.

44:58.965 --> 45:02.660
Come on. He must be an 11, right?

45:05.869 --> 45:07.666
Two 11s, unbelievable.

45:07.738 --> 45:09.204
Miss Douchebag, get rid of it.

45:09.305 --> 45:11.330
Oh, good evening, girls.
Good evening, ma'am.

45:11.407 --> 45:15.034
Oh, there's nothing as fine
as a sauna before bedtime.

45:15.109 --> 45:16.371
Oh, God.

45:16.443 --> 45:19.002
So good for the respiratory
system, don't you find?

45:19.078 --> 45:20.568
Yes. Oh, yes.

45:21.079 --> 45:22.808
Highly good for the lungs.

45:27.684 --> 45:30.982
If I don't get out of here soon,
I'm gonna end up the size of a prune.

46:34.630 --> 46:36.654
Coach! I'm okay.

46:36.731 --> 46:39.460
Listen to me... Perfectly okay.

46:39.533 --> 46:41.898
Let me help you.

46:43.636 --> 46:48.628
I got enough help from you this
afternoon to last me a lifetime.

46:48.772 --> 46:49.966
Coach!

46:50.673 --> 46:54.039
Let me take you to my room,
all right? You can sleep it off.

46:55.844 --> 46:57.037
Okay, here we are.

46:57.111 --> 46:58.271
Is this my room?

46:58.346 --> 46:59.335
Yep, come on.

47:30.268 --> 47:33.031
Oh, miss? Miss!

47:33.370 --> 47:35.360
Excuse me. Pardon me.

47:36.205 --> 47:37.432
Betsy?

47:38.606 --> 47:42.371
Betsy, I'm sorry. I was an
animal. Do you forgive me or what?

47:46.278 --> 47:50.771
Oh, I get it, the old
silent treatment, huh?

47:51.882 --> 47:56.613
Well, let me see how we can fix that.

51:17.721 --> 51:20.154
Hey Jim, where's the old pizzazz?

51:20.923 --> 51:24.255
The old pizzazz? Where's
the old pizzazz? Oh, yeah.

51:24.325 --> 51:26.383
Come on, you've got
the hottest girl here

51:26.460 --> 51:28.620
chasing after you and you're depressed?

51:28.694 --> 51:30.889
Why don't you just forget dumb
old Chris and give Jordan a chance?

51:30.963 --> 51:34.022
I don't ever wanna hear you say
anything bad about Chris again!

51:34.099 --> 51:35.793
Okay, okay.

51:40.769 --> 51:41.895
What's wrong with him?

51:41.970 --> 51:44.028
I don't know. Something about Chris.

51:45.740 --> 51:50.072
Why, Jim, I didn't expect to see
you here today. How you doing, son?

51:51.043 --> 51:56.036
Not too good, actually, Mr. Ramsay.
It's Chris. We had a misunderstanding.

51:56.513 --> 51:59.413
It's all my fault, but Chris
won't even talk to me now.

51:59.482 --> 52:02.280
Well, Chris has a mind
of her own, you know that.

52:02.350 --> 52:04.011
But I'll put in a good
word for you, if you like.

52:04.085 --> 52:07.076
Thanks a lot, Mr. Ramsay.
Thank you very much.

52:09.522 --> 52:14.049
<i>Good morning, we're delighted to
welcome you to Parents Day at Cherryvale.</i>

52:14.126 --> 52:16.559
<i>Refreshments are now
being served at the pool,</i>

52:16.627 --> 52:20.959
<i>and a full schedule of activities
has been planned for your enjoyment.</i>

52:21.931 --> 52:22.955
Here you go, Daddy.

52:23.032 --> 52:25.056
Thank you, sweetheart.

52:25.133 --> 52:27.623
Give me another one of these,
would you? Are you sure?

52:29.169 --> 52:30.294
Okay.

52:48.282 --> 52:52.808
Oh, I don't have to tell you, Coach
Whelan, how vital today's Parents Day is

52:52.885 --> 52:56.081
to the economic future of Cherryvale.
Yes, Miss Dutchbok. That's right.

53:13.799 --> 53:15.926
Oh, which reminds me, dear, excuse me.

53:16.001 --> 53:18.969
Jordan. Jordan, dear.
Yes, Miss Dutchbok?

53:19.036 --> 53:22.129
I'm so eager to meet your father,
but it is getting rather late, dear.

53:22.205 --> 53:25.002
Late? Miss Dutchbok, my
father is always late.

53:25.074 --> 53:27.268
My father likes to be late
so he can make an entrance.

53:27.342 --> 53:29.332
Ah, well, if he doesn't arrive soon,

53:29.409 --> 53:32.900
I'll just run up to the parking area
to make sure he hasn't lost his way.

53:32.979 --> 53:34.003
Whatever you say.

53:34.080 --> 53:35.512
You look so nice, dear.

53:41.885 --> 53:44.512
She's not gonna like me. I know it.

53:44.620 --> 53:45.814
Nonsense.

53:45.888 --> 53:49.550
Jordan loves all her new
mommies, and you're no exception.

53:50.057 --> 53:54.788
Come on, what does little Bambi-wambi
say to the dreat big drowly bear?

53:54.860 --> 53:56.225
I wove you.

54:03.933 --> 54:05.628
No more baby talk!

54:10.070 --> 54:11.560
Chauncey is watching.

54:11.639 --> 54:13.071
Chauncey, drive!

54:19.010 --> 54:21.876
<i>Stand aside, young
man! Make way! Make way!</i>

54:30.717 --> 54:32.742
Dad, you remember my roommate, Jordan?

54:32.819 --> 54:34.649
Very pleased to see
you again, Mr. Flugel.

54:34.720 --> 54:37.847
Jordan, little Jordan.

54:38.723 --> 54:42.886
You and Rita have been so close, I
just feel like a second Daddy to you.

54:42.992 --> 54:48.452
Yes, ma'am. You just think of yourself
as Frank Flugel's little girl anytime.

54:49.196 --> 54:51.096
Isn't that right, Rita?

54:52.399 --> 54:54.264
Oh! Stop, Mr. Flugel!

54:54.334 --> 54:56.358
Oh, what's going on here?

54:56.435 --> 54:58.698
I'm giving Bubba another chance.

54:58.770 --> 55:00.397
After what he did?

55:00.471 --> 55:03.928
What the hell? Maybe you
should give Jim a break, too.

55:05.708 --> 55:09.575
Come on, you didn't give up
those hotel reservations, did you?

55:10.245 --> 55:12.439
See, look at it this way.

55:13.113 --> 55:17.047
I'm gonna forgive Bubba.
Compared to Bubba, Jim's a saint.

55:17.649 --> 55:20.208
Compared to Bubba, anybody's a saint.

55:21.953 --> 55:23.886
Nice driving, Chauncey.

55:24.154 --> 55:26.678
Oh, I'm so glad you enjoyed it, sir.

55:27.590 --> 55:29.489
Come on, check it out!

55:30.425 --> 55:31.414
I got this one.

55:31.492 --> 55:36.086
<i>Make way, gentlemen, please! We won't
be needing any assistance this afternoon!</i>

55:36.162 --> 55:37.891
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

55:40.365 --> 55:41.797
Let me get it.

55:42.399 --> 55:44.094
Don't touch the car, please.

55:44.168 --> 55:45.156
Right.

56:11.853 --> 56:13.843
Jordan. Daddy!

56:13.921 --> 56:16.320
You are as beautiful as ever.

56:21.126 --> 56:24.219
Oh, I want you to meet
Bambi, your new stepmother.

56:24.295 --> 56:25.488
How do you do?

56:25.562 --> 56:28.792
What happened to the last one, Mrs.
Lawrence Leigh-Jensen number seven?

56:28.864 --> 56:31.991
Now, now, Jordan, let's not
behave like a cross child.

56:32.066 --> 56:34.625
We're all here to have fun.
We wanna meet all your friends.

56:34.701 --> 56:38.761
Oh, where is that lovely Miss Dutchbok
whom I've been corresponding with?

56:42.841 --> 56:43.829
Mmm!

56:45.909 --> 56:47.739
Yeah. Good.

57:07.691 --> 57:11.455
Hey, sweetheart, what class are you in?

57:11.526 --> 57:13.221
I'm not in any class.
I'm a teacher here.

57:13.294 --> 57:15.921
Oh, so what do you teach?

57:16.063 --> 57:17.586
Sex education.

57:18.331 --> 57:19.593
What?

57:19.666 --> 57:20.962
Sex education.

57:21.033 --> 57:24.365
Sex education? That's
my favorite subject!

57:40.146 --> 57:43.046
All right. Here, right here. Right here.

57:43.748 --> 57:45.113
Here you go. Here you go.

57:45.183 --> 57:47.548
Well, back, back, back,
back, I'll handle this now.

57:47.618 --> 57:50.108
My dear, I need to
give you some help here.

57:50.186 --> 57:51.812
Back up, back up.

58:03.062 --> 58:04.050
Hmm?

58:16.704 --> 58:18.137
I think she's gonna be all right.

58:34.183 --> 58:36.082
I guess we should talk.

58:38.452 --> 58:42.319
Nothing happened between
me and Jordan. I love you.

58:58.032 --> 58:59.021
Hello!

59:00.667 --> 59:05.864
Hello! Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

59:06.771 --> 59:11.002
Welcome. Welcome to Cherryvale.
I'm Miss Prudence Dutchbok.

59:12.641 --> 59:13.903
Charmed.

59:14.443 --> 59:18.673
And I've already guessed who you are.
Oh, yes, Jordan speaks of you ceaselessly.

59:18.746 --> 59:20.714
She's so proud of her father,

59:20.781 --> 59:25.182
and your kind letters and
continued support of Cherryvale.

59:25.250 --> 59:26.842
I think you're a remarkable man.

59:26.918 --> 59:29.385
Mademoiselle, you are far too kind.

59:29.453 --> 59:33.945
Oh, I hope you'll allow me to give
you a personal tour of the school.

59:34.022 --> 59:36.683
Well, I can think of nothing
that I would like better.

59:36.758 --> 59:39.988
Oh, I know you're interested in
seeing the sights of the new wing.

59:40.060 --> 59:41.960
Unfortunately, we...

59:42.028 --> 59:45.724
It's been difficult raising funds
for the construction beginning, but...

59:45.797 --> 59:48.732
Well, now, let's not
go another step further.

59:48.800 --> 59:52.325
Oh, dear, I seem to have
left my checkbook in the car.

59:52.401 --> 59:56.996
Would you mind accompanying me
back to the car, Miss Dutchbok?

59:58.105 --> 01:00:01.198
Oh, I'd love it, and
please call me Prudence.

01:00:01.274 --> 01:00:03.469
Very well, Prudence.

01:00:03.543 --> 01:00:04.531
Oh!

01:00:16.918 --> 01:00:20.717
I don't want to take up too much
of your time, Mr. Leigh-Jensen.

01:00:20.788 --> 01:00:23.119
May I call you Mr. Leigh-Jensen?

01:00:23.689 --> 01:00:25.088
If you wish.

01:00:25.525 --> 01:00:28.118
I'm sure Jordan will
be anxious to see you.

01:00:28.193 --> 01:00:31.127
She's probably wondering where you are.

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:36.765
Don't worry. No one is
gonna find us in here.

01:00:38.066 --> 01:00:39.362
Try this.

01:00:57.746 --> 01:00:59.111
Oh. Oh.

01:01:06.285 --> 01:01:07.946
Oh! What are you doing?

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:09.611
Does it displease you? Dutchbok.

01:01:09.687 --> 01:01:12.587
It doesn't displease me that much.

01:01:12.656 --> 01:01:17.786
But do you suppose while you're doing that,
my darling, you could write that check?

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.559
Well, of course I could, darling.

01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:24.854
Here, here, let me help
you with these buttons.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:28.024
These buttons? Yes, they're so binding.

01:01:28.099 --> 01:01:29.691
I wouldn't want anything to bind you.

01:01:30.935 --> 01:01:33.994
I'll take care of the buttons,
you take care of the check.

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:35.662
As you wish, dearest.

01:01:35.738 --> 01:01:37.136
Damn. What is it?

01:01:37.206 --> 01:01:38.605
I've dropped my pen.

01:01:38.674 --> 01:01:42.040
Oh, I'll get it... Oh!
Forgive me, Prudence.

01:01:42.476 --> 01:01:45.376
<i>A rash impulse. I couldn't resist.</i>

01:01:45.946 --> 01:01:49.744
No need to apologize.
The check, dearest?

01:01:49.948 --> 01:01:52.109
<i>Oh, yes, yes, of course. Damn!</i>

01:01:52.183 --> 01:01:55.345
<i>The pen? No, no, the check.
I've dropped the check.</i>

01:01:55.419 --> 01:01:59.444
<i>Well, let me. Oh, oh, stop that!</i>

01:02:00.689 --> 01:02:03.953
<i>Stop! Don't! Stop! Stop! Don't!</i>

01:02:04.024 --> 01:02:06.423
<i>Oh, my God, use both hands!</i>

01:02:06.492 --> 01:02:08.482
<i>But I need one to write the check.</i>

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:11.960
Oh, forget the goddamn
check! Use both hands!

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:15.520
<i>Do you like it like this? Oh, yes!</i>

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:20.797
<i>Yes! Don't be so gentle!</i>

01:02:21.102 --> 01:02:25.060
<i>How about this? Yes! Yes!</i>

01:02:25.138 --> 01:02:28.629
<i>And this? Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

01:02:28.908 --> 01:02:32.138
<i>Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!</i>

01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:35.307
<i>Wait a minute. Something
strange is happening here.</i>

01:02:35.379 --> 01:02:38.142
<i>There's nothing strange about two people
trying to give each other pleasure,</i>

01:02:38.214 --> 01:02:40.773
<i>no matter how bizarre the means. I know!</i>

01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:44.443
<i>And by the way, if you're turned on
to rubber garments, I happen to have...</i>

01:02:44.518 --> 01:02:45.984
<i>Oh, shut up, you fool!</i>

01:02:46.186 --> 01:02:51.383
Our voices! It's almost
as if they're amplified!

01:02:58.227 --> 01:03:00.421
Oh, you, miserable...

01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:02.854
You, you bit me!

01:03:04.031 --> 01:03:07.488
I didn't like you at first,
and I don't like you now!

01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:09.433
Wait! Wait!

01:03:10.202 --> 01:03:13.728
You bad, bad, bad boy! Let me out!

01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:24.870
What do you want me to do? I don't care!

01:03:25.178 --> 01:03:26.668
You can't do a damn thing!

01:03:32.317 --> 01:03:34.148
Never, never, never, never, never!

01:03:35.586 --> 01:03:36.780
Let the boy go!

01:03:36.854 --> 01:03:38.115
I never liked you, either!

01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:03.502
Holy shit.

01:04:08.042 --> 01:04:09.201
Whose car is this?

01:04:11.177 --> 01:04:12.473
Hey, Bubba!

01:04:12.544 --> 01:04:13.568
Bubba?

01:04:14.313 --> 01:04:15.973
Home, take me home!

01:04:18.148 --> 01:04:19.206
Was that my car?

01:04:20.816 --> 01:04:23.785
What did I do? You hit
the emergency brake!

01:04:24.085 --> 01:04:26.383
I'm sorry. Get your
paws off my derriÃ¨re.

01:04:39.229 --> 01:04:41.093
Hey, hey. Hey.

01:04:41.164 --> 01:04:42.721
How's it going?

01:04:43.966 --> 01:04:47.025
Okay, you two, have a really great
time. Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

01:04:47.101 --> 01:04:48.227
Right.

01:04:48.302 --> 01:04:50.201
Blow in her ear. It
really gets broads hot.

01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:51.294
Thanks for the advice, Bubba.

01:04:51.371 --> 01:04:53.133
Pinch her boobs. It'll drive her crazy.

01:04:53.205 --> 01:04:55.434
Great. I don't know
what I'd do without you.

01:04:57.008 --> 01:04:58.099
Bye.

01:05:02.478 --> 01:05:04.877
Okay, read me the
current spread. Let's see.

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:07.880
All right. The odds against you
getting her into the dorm are 2-to-1.

01:05:07.948 --> 01:05:09.245
Now, if you do get her there,

01:05:09.316 --> 01:05:11.840
the odds against you getting any
of her clothes off are 4-to-1.

01:05:11.918 --> 01:05:14.010
It's 7-to-1 against
you getting her top off.

01:05:14.086 --> 01:05:15.485
Piece of cake, Roy, piece of cake.

01:05:15.554 --> 01:05:18.454
But it's 9-to-1 against you
getting any actual bare tit!

01:05:18.522 --> 01:05:20.921
It's 12-to-1 against you
getting down to her panties.

01:05:21.024 --> 01:05:23.389
And 15-to-1 against you
getting her mother-ass naked.

01:05:23.459 --> 01:05:26.222
22-to-1 against you scoring
in any way, shape or form!

01:05:26.294 --> 01:05:27.488
Yee-haw!

01:05:27.562 --> 01:05:29.256
I'm gonna be rich!

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:44.500
Hello, can I speak to
Jordan Leigh-Jensen, please?

01:05:47.375 --> 01:05:49.605
Hello, Jordan? This is Bubba.

01:06:03.452 --> 01:06:04.851
Nice place.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.614
Yeah, nice.

01:06:10.057 --> 01:06:12.115
How long ago did you say
your parents stayed here?

01:06:12.191 --> 01:06:15.057
Twenty-three years
ago, on their honeymoon.

01:06:23.099 --> 01:06:24.191
May I help you?

01:06:24.267 --> 01:06:25.756
I'm the graphic designer.

01:06:25.834 --> 01:06:27.165
Excuse me?

01:06:27.236 --> 01:06:28.759
I called you on the phone.

01:06:29.303 --> 01:06:31.429
I made a reservation on
the phone. Do you remember?

01:06:31.505 --> 01:06:33.597
And what name did you give?

01:06:33.672 --> 01:06:35.105
Well, what name do you have?

01:06:35.174 --> 01:06:36.800
Excuse me?

01:06:36.875 --> 01:06:40.332
What I believe my wife is trying to say
is that she telephoned about a week ago.

01:06:40.411 --> 01:06:41.742
The name is Green.

01:06:41.812 --> 01:06:46.110
Green. Green. No, no, I'm
afraid I have no Mr. Green.

01:06:46.648 --> 01:06:48.673
It might be under Ramsay.

01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:51.309
Ramsay, Ramsay, Ramsay.

01:06:51.919 --> 01:06:53.545
Or possibly Jones.

01:06:57.523 --> 01:07:02.254
Jones, Jones. Ah, yes, here we
are. Mr. and Mrs. Rams-Jones.

01:07:02.325 --> 01:07:04.088
The honeymoon suite.

01:07:08.463 --> 01:07:10.726
There's late-night
entertainment in our piano bar.

01:07:10.798 --> 01:07:13.960
Of course, you have your world
famous sunsets on the D'Amour beach.

01:07:14.033 --> 01:07:18.093
And for a slight additional charge,
the Jacuzzi and the tennis courts.

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:19.228
Well, here we are.

01:07:19.304 --> 01:07:20.793
Is this the honeymoon suite?

01:07:21.939 --> 01:07:25.135
They're all honeymoon
suites since the remodeling.

01:07:53.294 --> 01:07:55.887
And I hope that you
have a pleasant stay.

01:07:55.962 --> 01:07:57.826
Thank you. Thank you.

01:08:11.306 --> 01:08:12.670
Thank you.

01:08:21.345 --> 01:08:23.370
Thank you very much, sir.

01:08:25.782 --> 01:08:27.841
You could tape them together.

01:08:37.689 --> 01:08:41.022
Well, so what do you think?

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:44.017
It's nice. It's very nice.

01:08:45.429 --> 01:08:49.330
I wonder if this is anything
like when Mom and Dad stayed here.

01:08:50.098 --> 01:08:51.587
Wow, look at this.

01:08:51.666 --> 01:08:55.100
Hey, pretty fancy, huh?

01:08:55.169 --> 01:08:58.160
This tub looks like it
could hold both of us.

01:08:59.971 --> 01:09:02.098
I mean, if we wanted it to.

01:09:03.174 --> 01:09:04.868
Look at this view.

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:12.337
Someone's at the door.

01:09:12.412 --> 01:09:13.812
So what?

01:09:13.881 --> 01:09:16.406
Relax, will you? Who's there?

01:09:21.953 --> 01:09:25.546
Some complimentary pink
champagne, Mr. Rams-Jones.

01:09:27.624 --> 01:09:29.113
Hey, thank you.

01:09:29.425 --> 01:09:32.120
Well, okay. Okay, enjoy it.

01:09:32.194 --> 01:09:33.524
Thank you.

01:09:34.595 --> 01:09:37.893
Wow, complimentary champagne.
This must've cost a mint.

01:09:38.564 --> 01:09:39.553
Uh-oh.

01:09:39.999 --> 01:09:41.057
What's wrong?

01:09:41.133 --> 01:09:42.689
Oh, there aren't any glasses.

01:09:43.768 --> 01:09:46.429
Well, we can drink out of the
plastic ones in the bathroom.

01:09:46.537 --> 01:09:48.060
No, don't be silly.

01:09:49.337 --> 01:09:53.273
I'll call room service. I'm dying
to give that guy a tip again.

01:10:02.848 --> 01:10:04.246
Is that her?

01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:08.850
I can't believe it! You
actually got her here.

01:10:08.919 --> 01:10:10.283
What'd I tell you, numbnuts?

01:10:10.352 --> 01:10:14.685
Okay. I got another 10 bucks says
you get her top off but no bare tit.

01:10:15.456 --> 01:10:17.514
You're on. Okay, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:10:17.591 --> 01:10:19.524
How are we supposed to
know how far you get?

01:10:19.592 --> 01:10:21.856
Yeah, you don't expect us to
take his word for it, do you?

01:10:21.928 --> 01:10:24.862
Good as gold. The man's word
is as good as gold. Trust me.

01:10:26.063 --> 01:10:28.792
Bubba's told the truth every
time! Hold it! I'll tell you what.

01:10:28.865 --> 01:10:31.856
You get in the closet with Roy,
the rest of you assholes, out.

01:10:31.934 --> 01:10:35.266
Hey, he gets to watch and not us.
You in on this with Bubba and Roy?

01:10:35.336 --> 01:10:37.270
Sam, every time he... Hold up here!

01:10:37.338 --> 01:10:40.272
I don't give a rat's ass which one
of you is in the closet with Roy,

01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:43.172
but I want the rest of you out of here
by the time I get back with Jordan.

01:10:43.242 --> 01:10:45.937
All right, gentlemen, last call.
Here we go! 4-to-1 clothes off.

01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:47.943
7-to-1 top off.
12-to-1 panties down.

01:10:48.011 --> 01:10:50.035
22-to-1 score
city. Who's in?

01:10:50.112 --> 01:10:51.670
10 on panties!

01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:54.915
Don't even mention it. I'd
do anything for that guy.

01:10:54.983 --> 01:10:57.917
But I'll tell you, Jordan,
if he weren't my best buddy,

01:10:57.985 --> 01:11:00.384
I'd have to put the
old moves on you myself.

01:11:00.453 --> 01:11:02.920
Really, now? But what about Betsy?

01:11:04.056 --> 01:11:09.048
Betsy? Betsy's an amusing girl,
but she and I are just good friends.

01:11:09.993 --> 01:11:11.789
I got you both down.

01:11:14.230 --> 01:11:17.665
Well, that's Jim's side. I'm over here.

01:11:20.033 --> 01:11:22.500
What do you think? Marvelous.

01:11:22.568 --> 01:11:25.627
Oh, surely you didn't
do all this yourself?

01:11:25.704 --> 01:11:29.605
Well, I guess some of the
guys in the dorm helped out.

01:11:37.311 --> 01:11:39.279
So, how's about a drink?

01:11:39.813 --> 01:11:41.212
When's Jim gonna get here?

01:11:41.281 --> 01:11:43.077
Any minute. Any minute.

01:11:43.148 --> 01:11:47.049
You just make yourself
comfortable. Take off your shoes!

01:11:47.118 --> 01:11:50.314
Or any other tight, binding
articles of clothing.

01:11:50.387 --> 01:11:52.547
And I'll mix you that drink.

01:12:00.894 --> 01:12:01.882
Ow!

01:12:02.428 --> 01:12:05.794
What's wrong? Wrong? Nothing. Nothing.

01:12:11.401 --> 01:12:13.925
You'll have to excuse me, Jordan.

01:12:14.036 --> 01:12:18.870
It's just I'm not used to receiving
female visitors in my room.

01:12:26.144 --> 01:12:28.806
And I must be a tad nervous.

01:12:28.946 --> 01:12:31.779
Nervous, Bubba, you of all people?

01:12:31.948 --> 01:12:33.882
It's just that, well...

01:12:37.586 --> 01:12:41.077
Being here alone with
you in this room...

01:12:41.155 --> 01:12:42.143
Yes?

01:12:45.858 --> 01:12:49.520
I feel that my loyalty
to Jim might be, well,

01:12:51.428 --> 01:12:53.123
compromised.

01:12:53.196 --> 01:12:54.526
Compromised?

01:12:56.299 --> 01:12:57.424
Yeah.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.166
It isn't perfect. It just isn't.

01:13:03.202 --> 01:13:06.500
And I'm not feeling romantic
like I thought I would.

01:13:07.306 --> 01:13:08.705
You're not?

01:13:10.808 --> 01:13:13.002
Well, what are you feeling?

01:13:13.076 --> 01:13:14.304
Nauseous.

01:13:19.747 --> 01:13:22.840
Well, Chris, this is just what I need.

01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:24.776
What? Nothing.

01:13:24.850 --> 01:13:26.977
No, what was it you said? Nothing.

01:13:27.986 --> 01:13:33.480
Listen, I'm sorry you're not feeling
romantic, Chris. I'm feeling romantic.

01:13:34.624 --> 01:13:35.955
You are?

01:13:36.025 --> 01:13:37.355
Absolutely.

01:13:38.026 --> 01:13:40.391
I mean, look at this place.

01:13:41.462 --> 01:13:44.225
It's the most romantic
place I've ever seen.

01:13:44.297 --> 01:13:48.289
Like this bed. Have you ever
slept in a vibrating bed before?

01:13:48.534 --> 01:13:49.795
No, but vibrating beds...

01:13:49.867 --> 01:13:53.893
Have you ever had pink
champagne, and a red fur rug

01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:56.767
and a knight in shining
armor standing by your bed?

01:13:56.839 --> 01:13:58.931
No. Well, all right.

01:13:59.007 --> 01:14:02.203
So here we are in the most
romantic place in the world,

01:14:02.276 --> 01:14:05.904
and here you are with the
most romantic guy in the world.

01:14:06.579 --> 01:14:08.011
Take me.

01:14:09.114 --> 01:14:13.106
Take me and do with me
what you will. Ravage me.

01:14:14.551 --> 01:14:17.383
Are you feeling
romantic now, my darling?

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:20.910
What I'm feeling is drunk and scared.

01:14:20.988 --> 01:14:24.286
And like I'm gonna toss
my cookies any second.

01:14:30.395 --> 01:14:31.521
Damn.

01:14:32.596 --> 01:14:36.031
And after our summer, she
begged me to stay, but...

01:14:40.836 --> 01:14:43.395
That was Paris.

01:14:43.471 --> 01:14:46.268
Look, Bubba, I'm getting really
sick of waiting for your friend.

01:14:46.339 --> 01:14:48.932
Jordan, just a little
longer. For Jim's sake.

01:14:49.007 --> 01:14:50.907
Come on, this is
ridiculous! I'm gonna go!

01:14:50.975 --> 01:14:52.738
Wait! Wait!

01:14:53.478 --> 01:14:57.674
Now, Jim bought a bottle of
vintage champagne just for tonight.

01:14:57.747 --> 01:15:02.706
He'd never forgive me if I let you go
without at least trying some. Please?

01:15:17.127 --> 01:15:18.458
VoilÃ !

01:15:18.528 --> 01:15:19.824
Red champagne?

01:15:19.895 --> 01:15:21.919
The finest money can buy.

01:15:22.730 --> 01:15:24.493
Just wait till you try this stuff.

01:15:24.565 --> 01:15:25.656
Whoa!

01:15:27.234 --> 01:15:29.599
Oh, I'm ... Look what you've done!

01:15:29.668 --> 01:15:31.498
My clothes are ruined!

01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:33.537
Take them off! All of them!

01:15:33.605 --> 01:15:35.868
Take them off and soak them.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.870
I'll get you a towel.

01:15:58.889 --> 01:15:59.946
No.

01:16:03.858 --> 01:16:05.381
Got one!

01:16:09.362 --> 01:16:12.489
Give me that! Do you have
any soda water? Soda water?

01:16:12.564 --> 01:16:14.360
To take the stains out!

01:16:14.432 --> 01:16:16.297
I'll go see if we have any.

01:16:31.577 --> 01:16:34.511
So tell me, Jordan,
would you like to dance?

01:16:56.928 --> 01:17:00.124
Oh, Betsy. What a great surprise.
I was just thinking about you.

01:17:00.197 --> 01:17:01.720
Oh, yeah? I'm sure.

01:17:01.797 --> 01:17:03.991
What in the world is going...

01:17:04.432 --> 01:17:06.127
I suppose you two know each other?

01:17:06.201 --> 01:17:07.428
What the hell are you doing here?

01:17:07.501 --> 01:17:09.662
I came here to meet Jim, if
it's any of your business.

01:17:09.736 --> 01:17:13.170
Is that right? You expected Jim to
leave Chris at the Hotel D'Amour?

01:17:13.238 --> 01:17:14.603
No! The Hotel D'Amour?

01:17:14.673 --> 01:17:16.663
That's right. They left hours ago.

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:19.435
Jim is at the Hotel D'Amour with Chris?

01:17:21.878 --> 01:17:23.674
I can't believe this!

01:17:24.279 --> 01:17:30.238
I spent all night in this pigsty
with you drinking after-shave cologne!

01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:35.285
Listening to your boring stories
about what a big lover you are!

01:17:37.821 --> 01:17:40.187
Where're my clothes?

01:17:40.257 --> 01:17:41.518
Your clothes?

01:17:49.163 --> 01:17:50.925
Where're my clothes?

01:17:51.331 --> 01:17:53.457
How am I gonna go out like this?

01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:00.368
Oh, thanks.

01:18:08.675 --> 01:18:13.373
Now, come on, girls. Can't you take
a joke? I mean, come on, it's funny!

01:18:23.987 --> 01:18:25.385
All right, come
on. 15-to-1.

01:18:25.454 --> 01:18:26.921
10-to-1.
All right.

01:18:26.989 --> 01:18:28.615
Come on. All right, Sam.

01:19:01.778 --> 01:19:03.609
Hi, there.

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:04.668
Hi.

01:19:06.749 --> 01:19:09.615
I couldn't find you. I got worried.

01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:21.983
I behaved like a real jerk.

01:19:23.192 --> 01:19:24.489
So did I.

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:30.424
I love you, Chris.

01:19:31.732 --> 01:19:33.699
I know. I love you, too.

01:19:35.234 --> 01:19:37.429
I guess this just wasn't it.

01:19:38.770 --> 01:19:40.169
Wasn't what?

01:19:40.805 --> 01:19:44.137
The right time, the right
place, the right anything.

01:19:46.776 --> 01:19:49.505
I tried so hard to pretend that it was.

01:19:49.978 --> 01:19:51.501
It just wasn't.

01:19:54.414 --> 01:19:57.644
It was just, I don't know, like, too...

01:19:58.116 --> 01:19:59.276
Tacky?

01:20:02.687 --> 01:20:06.451
God, I'm glad you said that.
I was afraid that you liked it.

01:20:06.855 --> 01:20:10.051
Really? I was afraid you liked it.

01:20:19.731 --> 01:20:23.530
I never could love anybody
more than I love you, Chris.

01:20:24.301 --> 01:20:25.562
Oh, Jim.

01:22:22.514 --> 01:22:26.074
I can't believe you made me
late to my own graduation.

01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:29.013
Now, Jordan, your father
doesn't get married every day.

01:22:29.085 --> 01:22:30.279
Just about every other day.

01:22:30.353 --> 01:22:32.912
Yes, Miss Copuletta. I mean, Mother.

01:22:32.988 --> 01:22:35.148
Chauncey, stay with the car this time.

01:22:35.256 --> 01:22:39.248
But, of course, Mr. Leigh-Jensen.
I always stay close to the car.

01:22:49.399 --> 01:22:53.060
<i>Parents, faculty, honored guests.</i>

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:59.032
<i>Welcome to the 86th Commencement
Exercises of Cherryvale Academy.</i>

01:22:59.739 --> 01:23:02.866
<i>Well, the year is finally at an end.</i>

01:23:02.941 --> 01:23:07.843
<i>It has been a long, hard struggle
but, girls, we've pulled together,</i>

01:23:07.912 --> 01:23:11.005
<i>and now you have finally
completed your studies.</i>

01:23:11.114 --> 01:23:16.209
<i>I see your teachers aglow with the
satisfaction of a job well done.</i>

01:23:17.351 --> 01:23:18.612
<i>I see...</i>

01:23:20.953 --> 01:23:22.215
I see...

01:23:26.157 --> 01:23:27.350
Never!

01:23:27.691 --> 01:23:31.057
<i>Your parents, secure in the knowledge</i>

01:23:31.127 --> 01:23:34.857
<i>that their daughters have
received the very best.</i>

01:23:34.963 --> 01:23:37.692
<i>And, you graduates, I see your joy.</i>

01:23:37.765 --> 01:23:41.131
<i>The justifiable pride
in your accomplishments.</i>

01:23:41.468 --> 01:23:45.403
<i>The excitement as you go
forward into your futures.</i>

01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:48.666
<i>You've blossomed from
awkward adolescence</i>

01:23:48.739 --> 01:23:51.639
<i>into the full bloom of young womanhood.</i>

01:23:51.707 --> 01:23:56.643
<i>But with this joy comes
a tug at the throat.</i>

01:23:57.579 --> 01:23:59.273
<i>A tiny sorrow.</i>

01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:01.708
<i>A tender nostalgia.</i>

01:24:01.781 --> 01:24:02.805
Hey, watch it, man!

01:24:02.882 --> 01:24:06.044
<i>I can remember my own
days here as a student.</i>

01:24:06.118 --> 01:24:12.077
<i>And certainly, on a day like today,
comes a wide array of varied emotions.</i>

01:24:12.789 --> 01:24:16.518
<i>In future years, you'll
reflect upon your years here</i>

01:24:17.692 --> 01:24:21.957
<i>and remember them, I am certain,
as the happiest time of your life.</i>

01:24:22.561 --> 01:24:24.552
<i>What of my own feelings?</i>

01:24:24.663 --> 01:24:27.995
<i>Well, we have had our ups and downs,</i>

01:24:28.066 --> 01:24:31.626
<i>but I shall miss your shining faces,</i>

01:24:31.702 --> 01:24:35.932
<i>even as you go forth to
fulfill your bright promise.</i>

01:24:36.505 --> 01:24:40.167
<i>And now I shall yield the
floor to Miss Newhouse,</i>

01:24:40.241 --> 01:24:43.232
<i>who, for reasons I don't
pretend to understand,</i>

01:24:43.309 --> 01:24:48.870
<i>has been elected to make the farewell
remarks on behalf of the graduates.</i>

01:24:50.981 --> 01:24:53.448
Sunny days. Sunny days.

01:24:57.852 --> 01:24:59.614
Thank you, Miss Dutchbok.

01:24:59.686 --> 01:25:01.779
On behalf of the
entire graduating class,

01:25:01.855 --> 01:25:04.322
I'd like to thank you for
all you've done for us.

01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:07.256
No, you won't be seeing
our shining faces anymore.

01:25:07.325 --> 01:25:09.792
Here's something you can
always remember us by.

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:11.327
Ready, girls?

01:25:12.095 --> 01:25:16.030
Graduation, Cherryvale!
You won't forget us soon!

01:25:16.131 --> 01:25:19.793
Sunny days ahead of us!
We leave behind this moon!

01:25:22.736 --> 01:25:24.396
Way to go!
