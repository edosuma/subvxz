to do side projects.
-(Boimler groans)

00:30.071 --> 00:31.740
-No! Why?! (shushing)
-So I took a bunch
of inert carbon

00:31.823 --> 00:33.616
-and built myself
a fluffy friend from scratch.
-Shut up!

00:33.700 --> 00:35.118
-No! Aah!
-It's supposed
to look like a dog.

00:37.036 --> 00:38.371

Come here! Come here.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.125
-(barking)
-Ah. (chuckles)
She's five percent faster

00:42.208 --> 00:44.002
and six percent smarter.
You know, I hand-edited

00:44.085 --> 00:45.920
-all six billion sequences.
It was really fun!

00:46.004 --> 00:48.006

for that?

that I'm going to the bathroom,

00:49.382 --> 00:51.301

00:51.384 --> 00:53.094

You do.

An elite team from the Cerritos

02:44.998 --> 02:47.375
has been selected
by Admiral Syltrack to liaise

02:47.458 --> 02:50.295

colony in disputed territory.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.130
Captain Freeman, Shaxs,
and myself

02:52.213 --> 02:53.715
have been enlisted
to join the mission

02:53.798 --> 02:56.718

the germination of rulot seeds.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.784
I don't want to die in space!
I don't want to die in space!

17:56.867 --> 17:59.161
-We're all gonna...
-Pick her up.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.996
We have to get to the bridge.
That's where we beamed in.

18:01.079 --> 18:02.998
-There's a good chance
we can still get a signal out.
-Ugh.

18:03.081 --> 18:05.042
Where has this Mariner been
all day?

18:05.125 --> 18:06.210
-I don't know what
you're talking about.
-No, no, no, no.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.003
Something's going on here.

18:08.086 --> 18:09.963
Been non-stop screwing up,
then suddenly, you're back

18:10.047 --> 18:11.340
to taking charge and
punching out captains and...

18:11.423 --> 18:12.341
Wait a minute.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.343
-(loud thudding)
-(groaning)

18:14.426 --> 18:16.345
Maybe let's talk, like, after
the giant space emergency.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.347
You were taking a dive,
weren't you?

18:18.430 --> 18:20.182
You figured out I was gonna
offer you a spot on the Oakland.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.643
Yeah, well, maybe
I didn't want my best friend

18:22.726 --> 18:24.186
trying to trick me
into a job I didn't want.

18:24.269 --> 18:26.188
-You ever think of that?
-Ugh!

18:26.271 --> 18:27.314
We all thought you'd be the
first captain from our class.

18:27.397 --> 18:30.317
You got the best grades,
you kept us all on track.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.528
Now it seems like
you don't even like Starfleet.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.197
You used to do whatever
you wanted whenever you wanted.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.491
Now you got to check in
with Durga every five minutes.

18:37.574 --> 18:40.744
Because I love leading a team
that puts their trust in me.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.329
Fine, but I don't love

18:42.412 --> 18:43.539
that everyone's
always screaming at me

18:43.622 --> 18:44.748
to rank up and take charge.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.750
Why can't I just be
a super great ensign?

18:46.834 --> 18:48.836
Look, how about you stop
pretending to be a (bleep),

18:48.919 --> 18:50.504
and I'll stop trying
to recruit you,

18:50.587 --> 18:53.382
-and we can go save
these people?
-Deal!

18:53.465 --> 18:54.883
(panting, whimpering)

18:54.967 --> 18:55.884
-Got you.
-(crowd clamoring)

18:55.968 --> 18:58.554
A rat trapped in an airlock.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.389
That sounds about right.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.057
Any last words?

19:02.140 --> 19:03.350
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me!

19:03.433 --> 19:05.352
I'm just a freak like you, see?

19:05.435 --> 19:07.020
(gasps, laughs)

19:07.104 --> 19:09.022
It wore off!
I'm not a freak anymore!

19:09.106 --> 19:11.400
Hey, would you look at that!
Great!

19:11.483 --> 19:13.443
You're normal now. (laughs)

19:13.527 --> 19:15.404
Enjoy your walk in space.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.031
(alarm sounding)

19:20.450 --> 19:23.662
Wait. Why is the air not
being forced from my lungs?

19:25.163 --> 19:27.249
The Farm! It's real?

19:27.332 --> 19:29.251
Isn't it beautiful?
The missions might be long,

19:29.334 --> 19:32.379
but it's worth it
every time we get back.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.590
Ooh! Do I have egg on my face.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.550
Sir, I'm sorry for the whole...

19:36.633 --> 19:38.719
-mutiny thing.
-I get it.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.388
The Farm does seem unbelievable.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.932
No, I'm sorry I reacted
the way I did.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.267
We should have just
talked it out.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.102
Which is what I said
we should do!

19:47.185 --> 19:49.897
Next time, we'll avoid
a mutiny before it happens.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.357
Maybe paint the ship
some friendlier colors,

19:52.441 --> 19:54.610
turn on some lights
so it isn't so creepy.

19:54.693 --> 19:58.155
Enjoy your path
to recovery, my friends.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.407
(evil cackling)

20:01.825 --> 20:03.368
Oh, it's just the way I laugh.

20:05.537 --> 20:09.124
(easy listening music plays)

20:09.207 --> 20:11.335
(beeps)

20:12.377 --> 20:16.256
(breathing loudly)

20:16.340 --> 20:18.175
This is where
we have to say goodbye.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.010
(gasps)
I never wanted to leave you.

20:20.093 --> 20:22.262
You're not a freak.
You're just a good dog.

20:22.346 --> 20:25.057
I will never give up trying
to get you back home.

20:25.140 --> 20:28.143
Tendi, you have been
an exemplary creator.

20:28.226 --> 20:30.646
But do not cry.
I like it here!

20:30.729 --> 20:32.314
There's far more space to run

20:32.397 --> 20:34.483
and many fascinating things
upon which to urinate.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.194
(gasps) Oh, wow.
I'm so glad you're happy!

20:37.277 --> 20:39.947
Well, The Dog,
then I guess this is goodbye.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.490
Farewell, Tendi.

20:41.573 --> 20:45.327
May the suns shine upon you.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.870
(Tendi sighs)

20:46.954 --> 20:48.622
Wait. You knew
she could talk and walk?

20:48.705 --> 20:50.499
Yeah, of course she can talk.
She's a dog.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.335
-Normal dogs don't do any
of that stuff.
-They don't?

20:53.418 --> 20:55.504
Wait. But normal dogs
hover and spit lightning, right?

20:55.587 --> 20:58.382
-No, none of that!
-Oh!

20:58.465 --> 21:00.884
Well, then this is starting
to make a lot more sense.

21:00.968 --> 21:03.428
Hey, you are a freak.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.348
I know!
I just didn't want you to worry.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.558
Oh, she's such a good girl.

21:08.642 --> 21:11.895
Oh, we call dibs on this cutie.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.522
-(laughing): Oh.
-No, he shouldn't

21:13.605 --> 21:15.524
even be here.
He's not a freak anymore.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.693
-You're not?
-I, uh, I have acid reflux.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.153
That's kind of freakish.
(grunts)

21:20.237 --> 21:22.531
Wait, wait, wait!

21:22.614 --> 21:24.282
No. (whimpers)

21:26.952 --> 21:29.538
-(thudding)
-(whimpering)

21:29.621 --> 21:33.000
(gasps)

21:33.083 --> 21:35.627
Not today, snot! (grunts)

21:41.967 --> 21:44.386
-(both grunting)
-Durga, report.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.723
There's some sort of alien
entity inside the ship.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.433
-Oh, you think?
-Okay, everybody,

21:49.516 --> 21:50.517
we're gonna get you out of here.

21:50.600 --> 21:54.062
(thudding)

21:54.146 --> 21:56.898
-Warren, beam us out of here.
-I'm trying. There's too many.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.527
-We-we won't have time.
-(clinking, hissing)
-Rutherford!

22:00.610 --> 22:02.237
We need your transporter
thing up and running now!

22:02.320 --> 22:03.447
It made Boimler weird!

22:03.530 --> 22:04.573
Boim us out of here!

22:04.656 --> 22:06.908
(whimpering)

22:06.992 --> 22:10.370
-Hold on!
-Rutherford!
-(yelling)

22:10.454 --> 22:12.748
-(glass breaking)
-(screaming)

22:12.831 --> 22:15.584
(yelling)

22:15.667 --> 22:17.210
(screaming)

22:17.294 --> 22:18.628
(grunts)

22:18.712 --> 22:20.589
Come on, baby.
Give Rutherford the juice!

22:20.672 --> 22:22.090
(grunting)

22:22.174 --> 22:23.967
(creaking)

22:24.051 --> 22:26.595
(thud)

22:26.678 --> 22:28.555
-(gasping)
-(metallic trilling)

22:28.638 --> 22:31.558
(whooping, laughing, cheering)

22:31.641 --> 22:33.435
Oh, man, I knew
you could do it, Ruthy!

22:33.518 --> 22:35.270
Why are we still in phase?

22:35.353 --> 22:36.897
Ah, it's just cosmetic.

22:36.980 --> 22:41.610
-It's just cosmetic.
-(cheering, whooping)

22:45.363 --> 22:47.407
RAMSEY:
Captain's log.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.826
The evacuation of the U.S.S.
Rubidoux was a success,

22:49.910 --> 22:52.454
thanks to the quick thinking
of the Cerritos crew.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.791
While the exact classification
of this space entity eludes us,

22:55.874 --> 23:00.003
we believe it to be peaceful,
in search of a home.

23:01.713 --> 23:02.923
You're cured?

23:03.006 --> 23:04.466
I mean, see?
I knew you'd be fine.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.468
Listen, you got
to mess me up again.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.470
Not permanently, but maybe,
like, a nice two-week freak.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.639
I have been tinkering
with some ancient plasmas.

23:10.722 --> 23:13.308
Aw. Good afternoon.
I'm Tendi.

23:13.391 --> 23:15.936
How are you today?
Ugh. Ugh!

23:16.019 --> 23:18.814
Ugh! She licked me.
What a weirdo!

23:18.897 --> 23:20.649
Would you look at that?

23:20.732 --> 23:22.609
Nothing like a big,
crazy alien to remind you

23:22.692 --> 23:24.820
why "space explorer" is
such a great gig.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.488
Yeah, it's the best.

23:26.571 --> 23:29.741
Well, Starfleet isn't perfect,
but my offer still stands.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.828
If you want a chance to lead
by example, I'd have your back.

23:32.911 --> 23:36.039
Yeah, if I was gonna rank up
for anyone, it would be you,

23:36.123 --> 23:37.833
but, you know, I still have
some stuff to figure out

23:37.916 --> 23:39.793
while I'm lower decks,
about who I want to be.

23:39.876 --> 23:42.629
Like, maybe I'll buckle down
and become a captain.

23:42.712 --> 23:44.172
Maybe I won't. (laughs)
Probably won't.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.299
-I just need time to find me.
-I know you will.

23:46.383 --> 23:49.469
Well, well, well,
beautiful Captain Ramsey.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.471
I'd love to buy you a drink.

23:51.555 --> 23:52.639
-(both grunting)
-(glass breaking)

23:52.722 --> 23:55.517
Oh. Sorry, Ransom.
Instincts kicked in.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.602
I'll take a pass on that drink.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.479
(both laugh)

23:59.563 --> 24:01.189
(grunts)
Good one, Ramsey.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.525
That's our thing.
She's kidding.
