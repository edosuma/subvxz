WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.570
- Memento mori.

00:02.636 --> 00:04.305
Remembrances of death.

00:04.338 --> 00:07.075
The eyes transform
to something more disturbed.

00:07.141 --> 00:09.843
[tense music]

00:09.910 --> 00:11.345
- You deserve someone like me.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.646
- I asked you to marry me.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.848
You said no, if you recall.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.517
- I'm an alienist.

00:16.584 --> 00:17.618
- As am I.

00:17.685 --> 00:18.986
Karen Stratton.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.354
- There is always a trail,

00:20.421 --> 00:21.989
no matter
the criminal's stealth.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.357
- 247 Hudson Street.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.093
- Goo Goo owns that place.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.195
- We believe
the kidnapper is a woman.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.363
I think the best plan
is that someone goes

00:29.430 --> 00:31.199
into the Lying-In Hospital
undercover.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.866
- There's no babies up there.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.836
They tell the women up there
they all had stillborns.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.305
- Libby.
- Oh, my.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.006
It's quite the armory
you have here.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.008
- A legacy from my father.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.710
You saw who took your baby?

00:42.810 --> 00:45.146
- Yes.
I saw her face.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.715
- The killer is a person
in great pain.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.951
- Well, whoever they are...
they will kill again.

00:56.957 --> 00:59.893
[eerie music]

[baby coos]

01:39.200 --> 01:42.002
- Oh.
I was looking for Marie.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.739
- Illness in the family.
She's gone to take care.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.108
- I'm so sorry to hear that.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.043
- Now is not a good time,
I'm afraid.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.046
[baby crying]

01:53.113 --> 01:55.349
- Oh, you have a child!

01:55.416 --> 01:58.085
- I think it's her teatime.
Good-bye.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.787
I'll tell her you stopped in.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.622
- Oh.
[baby coos]

02:02.923 --> 02:05.125
- My poor girl.
There, there.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.794
[baby cooing]

02:06.894 --> 02:10.398
Good girl.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.799
[grunts]

02:11.865 --> 02:12.900
Come here.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.636
Shh.

02:17.037 --> 02:19.973
[baby fussing]

02:20.040 --> 02:23.110
* *

02:23.143 --> 02:25.779
Ah, there you go.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.815
There you go.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.384
[sighs]

02:30.451 --> 02:31.885
[baby crying]
Ow.

[grunts]

02:36.924 --> 02:38.125
[screams]

02:38.158 --> 02:39.460
Stop!

02:39.493 --> 02:42.430
- [crying loudly]
- Stop. Stop.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.232
No.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.666
No, stop, stop, stop.

02:45.766 --> 02:50.170
My--my baby--
my baby doesn't bite.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.973
[baby continues crying]

02:53.006 --> 02:54.675
[whines]

02:54.742 --> 02:57.411
[crying continues]

02:57.478 --> 03:00.180
This is all your fault.

03:00.248 --> 03:02.583
Stop looking at me,
you stupid thing.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.918
[baby crying]

03:04.985 --> 03:06.654
[laughs]

03:06.687 --> 03:08.689
Stupid, stupid.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.591
You stupid thing.

03:10.658 --> 03:17.698
* *

03:20.834 --> 03:23.771
[dark music]

03:23.837 --> 03:30.878
* *

03:54.535 --> 03:55.736
- I never meant to put you
in harm's way

03:55.836 --> 03:59.072
for a case, Bitsy.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.409
- Where do you think she is
now?

04:01.509 --> 04:02.810
Libby?

04:02.876 --> 04:04.077
- No one knows.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.546
- [sighs]

04:05.579 --> 04:07.080
She gave me a real fright,

04:07.180 --> 04:10.217
even before I saw the syringe
in her hand.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.220
When she smiled,
she had black teeth.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.889
- Like in the Napp baby's
mouth?

04:15.923 --> 04:19.527
[tense music]

04:19.593 --> 04:22.696
Do you remember anything else
that could help us find her?

04:22.763 --> 04:25.499
* *

04:25.566 --> 04:28.101
I'll have John
work on a sketch.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.037
The photograph
from Central Park is unclear,

04:30.103 --> 04:33.106
but it might be sufficient.

04:33.206 --> 04:35.843
Get some rest.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.277
I'll be by to see you later.

04:37.345 --> 04:41.081
* *

04:41.114 --> 04:44.352
- Sara.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.019
There's another photo.

04:46.086 --> 04:53.026
* *

04:53.093 --> 04:55.629
[baby crying in distance]

05:00.133 --> 05:01.969
- Do we reopen the Napp case?

05:02.069 --> 05:03.771
- Absolutely not.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.272
The appearance
of another suspect

05:05.305 --> 05:07.207
only affirms
what we already knew:

05:07.274 --> 05:09.242
Martha Napp had an abettor.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.550
- Now the larger matter.

05:16.617 --> 05:19.152
Regarding the privacy
of our benefactors.

05:19.252 --> 05:21.555
- Sara Howard isn't interested
in that.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.591
All she cares about
is the Spanish baby.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.559
- Yeah, but we have to assume
that she knows,

05:25.626 --> 05:28.496
that her little
undercover assistant told her

05:28.596 --> 05:29.963
about the research wing.

05:29.997 --> 05:33.066
- We're here to protect names
and reputations.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.802
Yes?

05:34.835 --> 05:38.271
That's what we're here for,
yes?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.741
I need to be clear
on something, Markoe.

05:40.808 --> 05:43.010
I'm in service
to this institution

05:43.110 --> 05:47.014
because I think that helping
poor, unfortunate women

05:47.080 --> 05:50.250
and their innocent children
to be a noble undertaking.

05:50.317 --> 05:52.486
- Well, I'm grateful
you recognize the value

05:52.520 --> 05:53.787
of our charitable work here.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.956
- You have a holy ethos here,
yes?

05:56.023 --> 05:57.024
- We do.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.358
- I'm a communicant at

05:58.426 --> 05:59.693
the Church
of the Holy Sacrament

05:59.793 --> 06:03.363
and paterfamilias
to five young women.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.199
I ain't naive.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.468
I understand that sometimes,

06:07.535 --> 06:09.537
the way an unwanted child
is spared

06:09.603 --> 06:10.804
a miserable upbringing

06:10.871 --> 06:12.873
involves telling
their unfit mothers

06:12.973 --> 06:14.475
that they lost 'em.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.713
But the telling had better be
the extent of it.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.453
Because if it ain't,
I'm coming after you myself.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.387
Is that understood?

06:27.488 --> 06:29.890
- Understood.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.960
- And the names
of these gentlemen...

06:33.026 --> 06:34.662
your nurses don't know them?

06:35.496 --> 06:38.466
- Well, there's one who knows
a little bit more.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.233
Almost everything,
but I trust her.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.002
- You trust her?

06:42.069 --> 06:44.505
- The matron has been with me
for years.

06:44.572 --> 06:47.575
- Whatever the case,
we should question her, huh?

06:47.675 --> 06:49.577
- Well, she was due
a little while ago,

06:49.643 --> 06:51.712
but she hasn't reported in yet.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.581
- But first, we should talk
to this ward girl,

06:53.647 --> 06:55.348
Miss Colleen Ledwidge.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.052
- Could be nothing,

06:59.086 --> 07:01.154
but I did think it's curious

07:01.221 --> 07:04.157
that today is the matron's
first absence from work.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.359
- You were right to alert me,
Lucius.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.396
It's better we talk to her
first.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.931
It's not much further.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.767
- And if we find the matron
in bed with a cold?

07:13.867 --> 07:15.569
- We apologize
for any intrusion

07:15.603 --> 07:18.071
and ask her to help us find
Libby Hatch.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.040
- [chuckles]

07:20.107 --> 07:23.343

07:41.361 --> 07:44.598
[knob clicks,

07:50.303 --> 07:53.306
Hello?

07:53.373 --> 07:55.275
Anyone there?

07:55.308 --> 07:58.812
- We have no cause to enter
this woman's apartment.

07:58.912 --> 08:05.819

08:34.014 --> 08:36.617
* *

08:36.684 --> 08:39.687
[flash powder bangs
and sizzles]

08:40.353 --> 08:41.655
- This is monstrous.

08:41.689 --> 08:44.257
- It is appalling, I grant you,

08:44.324 --> 08:46.627
but equally, it's enthralling.

08:46.694 --> 08:50.130
If you look closely here,
what do you see?

08:50.197 --> 08:51.331
- Bruises on the neck.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.766
- [gasping]
- She held her.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.302
Most likely with a knife
against her throat.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.104
- [grunts]

08:57.170 --> 08:58.538
- This was punishment.

08:58.606 --> 09:01.174
She wanted to watch her die.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.711
- [humming]
- See the life leave her body.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.046
What is certain is that
she sought out this woman

09:06.113 --> 09:07.715
expressly to kill her.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.282
Her motivation's
entirely different

09:09.349 --> 09:11.384
from the killing of the baby.

09:11.451 --> 09:14.387
- [humming]

09:14.454 --> 09:17.390
[eerie music]

09:17.457 --> 09:24.197
* *

09:24.231 --> 09:31.504
- [humming]

09:34.407 --> 09:35.643
[woman screams]

09:39.246 --> 09:46.219
[humming]

09:47.587 --> 09:50.824
[humming continues]

09:52.926 --> 09:55.095
- She was trying on
another life.

09:55.162 --> 10:02.202
* *

10:06.874 --> 10:11.511
[silverware clattering gently]

10:11.578 --> 10:17.050
- [humming]

10:17.117 --> 10:21.254

10:21.288 --> 10:22.723
[woman screams]

10:28.228 --> 10:31.464

* *

10:44.644 --> 10:47.614
[musical sting]

10:50.150 --> 10:51.651
- Lucius.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.321
See if you can lift her head
for me.

10:54.421 --> 11:01.661
* *

11:02.495 --> 11:06.333
- The eyelids.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.935
- Like the Napp baby.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.403
- They appear
to have been drawn in blood.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.006
Truly, she has lost her mind.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.308
- Or perhaps
she's simply reordered it

11:15.342 --> 11:17.144
to make sense of her actions.

11:17.177 --> 11:21.681
*

11:21.749 --> 11:24.251
- I found something.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.685
Acetanilide.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.855
- What about
the charcoal powder?

11:27.921 --> 11:29.322
- None that I could find,

11:29.356 --> 11:31.992
which means
if she's ingesting the poison,

11:32.025 --> 11:35.095
it's passing to the child.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.597
- Without anything
to neutralize it.

11:37.664 --> 11:41.835
* *

11:41.869 --> 11:45.205
We're running out of time.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.208
[baby coughing]

11:48.308 --> 11:55.048
* *

12:00.053 --> 12:02.355
- I'll leave the light on
for you.

12:02.389 --> 12:09.662
*

12:19.807 --> 12:21.074
[door squeaks shut]

12:21.174 --> 12:24.211
[baby crying]

12:25.245 --> 12:28.215
*

12:31.351 --> 12:34.554
[chalk squeaking]

12:40.227 --> 12:41.361
- She stood
right in front of me,

12:41.428 --> 12:43.496
and I didn't even see her.

12:46.333 --> 12:49.202
- So we're no closer
to finding this baby.

12:49.236 --> 12:52.205
What do we actually know
about Libby Hatch?

12:52.239 --> 12:53.406
Her shift in behavior--

12:53.506 --> 12:55.108
- Not simply a shift,
but a mutation.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.609
Brutally stabbing
a contemporary

12:56.709 --> 12:58.846
is much different
than replacing a lost child

12:58.879 --> 12:59.880
with another.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.214
- Her attack on me,

13:01.248 --> 13:02.582
it wasn't planned.

13:02.682 --> 13:04.417
She waited
until I presented as a threat.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.519
- You posed a threat to her,
but the matron,

13:06.553 --> 13:09.556
she sought her out
in a savage and bloody fashion.

13:10.557 --> 13:14.061
In both cases, I'm afraid,
entirely understandable.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.628
- Well, Bitsy nearly died.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.230
- Sentimentality will do us
no good

13:17.264 --> 13:18.565
in our search for her.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.234
- What about the escalation
in violence?

13:21.301 --> 13:22.702
Surely, that must account
for something.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.571
- It means
that the different people

13:24.637 --> 13:26.806
who she presents to the world
can no longer be contained.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.642
It means...

13:29.742 --> 13:31.411
she's unraveling.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.581
[tense music]

13:34.647 --> 13:37.217
[chatter]

13:37.250 --> 13:41.654
*

13:41.754 --> 13:44.591
[cigarette sizzles]

13:46.759 --> 13:53.600
*

13:57.104 --> 14:00.340
[baby crying distantly]

14:02.475 --> 14:04.777
[crying grows louder]

14:04.811 --> 14:06.479
- Excuse me.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.781
Excuse me, can I, uh...

14:08.848 --> 14:11.784
[crying continues]

14:11.851 --> 14:18.926
* *

14:32.539 --> 14:35.808
[people chatting,
bell ringing]

14:52.993 --> 14:56.063
- A comprehensive gallery
of known criminals

14:56.163 --> 14:59.199
and those that fraternize
with 'em.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.334
- Here.

15:02.735 --> 15:06.239
Now, are any of these offenders

15:06.339 --> 15:08.841
the nurse you know
as Libby Hatch?

15:08.875 --> 15:11.511
- I don't understand how any
of this is supposed to help.

15:11.544 --> 15:12.812
- So we can share her likeness

15:12.845 --> 15:15.315
with our officers
combing the streets.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.018
- Keep looking.

15:18.051 --> 15:25.325
*

15:47.014 --> 15:49.516
Have you spotted something?

15:51.218 --> 15:54.721
Ah?

15:54.787 --> 15:55.955
Her?

15:56.056 --> 16:01.961
* *

16:02.062 --> 16:05.265
- No name.
Only her aliases.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.267
Looks like she likes
to hang out with gangsters.

16:07.367 --> 16:12.272
* *

16:14.541 --> 16:16.643
- You should go home.
Get some rest.

16:16.743 --> 16:20.313
- I've had better days,
but I'd like to stay.

16:20.413 --> 16:21.948
Help you catch her.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.417
- Walk her home, would you,
Milly?

16:24.484 --> 16:26.319
- Course, Miss Sara.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.925
- If you'd like to go walking
sometime...

16:32.992 --> 16:34.827
- If she's replacing
the lost child,

16:34.927 --> 16:36.096
as we've surmised,

16:36.129 --> 16:38.665
in her mind,
that child is frozen in time.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.301
Any growth beyond that
of her own baby

16:41.401 --> 16:44.771
would be greeted
with skepticism.

16:44.804 --> 16:47.140
- A mother would notice
the slightest change in weight

16:47.240 --> 16:49.942
or facial features.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.744
One does not have to have
given birth

16:51.778 --> 16:53.780
to understand such things.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.649
- I said nothing.

16:56.749 --> 17:00.453
- Perhaps the Linares baby
has overstayed its welcome.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.522
- Which means
that Libby's actions

17:02.622 --> 17:04.757
will be more unpredictable
than ever.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.460
- Should I run a likeness
of her in "The Times"?

17:15.001 --> 17:18.004
- I think we have to.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.472
- Fine.

17:19.506 --> 17:22.442
I shall see to it
it's in the evening edition.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.311
- We found her
in Byrnes' mug shot book.

17:24.344 --> 17:25.812
She looks different.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.847
Different names, aliases
and the like, but it's her.

17:27.947 --> 17:29.682
- She has a criminal record?
- No.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.184
She's in there
as a known associate

17:31.284 --> 17:32.619
of various criminal types.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.454
They seem to operate
around Gansevoort Market

17:34.487 --> 17:35.488
and Hudson Street.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.524
- Duster territory.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.164
*

17:44.231 --> 17:49.001
- [humming]

17:49.068 --> 17:52.139
[baby crying]

17:53.240 --> 17:55.142
Only two things that mewl.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.043
[crying continues]

17:57.144 --> 17:59.812
Cats...

17:59.846 --> 18:01.348
and babies.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.916
* *

18:04.016 --> 18:06.753
Maybe you're a cat.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.590
A sneaky cat...

18:10.690 --> 18:15.995
looking for a saucer of milk.

18:16.028 --> 18:19.065
[crying continues]

18:24.171 --> 18:25.438
[grunts]

18:25.538 --> 18:28.541
* *

18:28.575 --> 18:31.944
I won't forget you...

18:32.044 --> 18:34.681
little cat.

18:34.714 --> 18:38.351
I remember all my babies.

18:38.385 --> 18:45.625
*

18:48.027 --> 18:49.061
- Just one.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.064
[dynamic music]

18:52.131 --> 18:59.206
* *

19:21.661 --> 19:22.929
- Give it a shot of burny.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.097
[dog growls]
That's a good girl.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.999
[laughs]

19:27.099 --> 19:30.169
[sniffs]

19:30.270 --> 19:31.170
- [sniffs]

19:31.271 --> 19:33.105
[dog growling]

19:33.172 --> 19:34.607
[dog barking]
- [indistinct shout]

19:34.641 --> 19:35.942
- Hey! Go after it!

19:36.008 --> 19:38.177
Come here!
- Come back here, you mutt!

19:38.278 --> 19:40.179
[dog barking, men shouting]

19:40.280 --> 19:41.614
- [sighs]

19:41.681 --> 19:43.950
- The hell was that?
- Dog fights tonight.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.286
I can tell they kicked off
when this place empties out

19:46.319 --> 19:47.787
and they go make their bets.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.822
At least it'll be civilized
for a couple hours.

19:49.922 --> 19:52.959
- Cyrus, do you know
that woman?

19:55.127 --> 19:56.996
- Yeah, I know her.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.865
I ain't seen her in a while,
but I know her.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.200
- Where?
Where have you seen her?

20:01.301 --> 20:03.303
- Right here.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.305
This is Goo Goo Knox's woman.

20:05.372 --> 20:11.177
* *

20:11.278 --> 20:14.547
- So we need to find
Goo Goo Knox to find Libby.

20:14.647 --> 20:18.217
- We should review everything
we have on the Dusters.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.519
- Whoa, there.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.698
- I keep telling the girls
to turn down the lights

20:31.798 --> 20:33.300
when they leave.

20:33.333 --> 20:40.573
*

20:49.215 --> 20:52.184
[door creaking]

20:52.218 --> 20:59.258
*

21:10.703 --> 21:12.171
Someone's been here.

21:12.204 --> 21:19.245
*

21:34.394 --> 21:37.430
My father's gun.

21:37.530 --> 21:40.066
It's gone.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.236
*

21:44.270 --> 21:45.304
- Sara.

21:45.405 --> 21:52.612
* *

21:56.048 --> 21:57.384
- Libby.

21:57.417 --> 22:01.053
[music builds rapidly]

22:08.227 --> 22:10.062
- I haven't really used
much of the room

22:10.129 --> 22:12.064
since my grandmother passed.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.800
- This precaution
isn't necessary.

22:13.900 --> 22:14.967
I appreciate your concern,

22:15.001 --> 22:16.636
but I do not require
a chaperone.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.405
- Well, then, you're in luck.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.673
My presence is required
elsewhere this evening.

22:24.243 --> 22:26.446
- We need to go back
to Hudson Street.

22:28.981 --> 22:32.985
It's the only address we have
for Goo Goo Knox.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.821
- Libby is a danger to you.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.989
I insist you stay here
until she is in custody

22:37.089 --> 22:38.425
or otherwise deterred.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.960
- [exhales heavily]

22:40.993 --> 22:43.796
*

22:43.830 --> 22:47.500
- Sara, I said
some harsh things

22:47.534 --> 22:51.137
and I've been thinking
about why I said them.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.473
It may take some time
and possibly some courage

22:53.506 --> 22:55.174
before I find the answers.

22:55.274 --> 23:00.647
* *

23:00.680 --> 23:04.216
Now, please, bolt the door
after I leave.

23:04.316 --> 23:10.356
* *

23:24.871 --> 23:25.872
[knock at door]

23:29.709 --> 23:33.245
[knock at door]
- Not now, please.

23:33.345 --> 23:35.414
[door latch clicks]

23:38.084 --> 23:39.586
What is it, Paulie?

23:39.686 --> 23:41.087
- I want to show you
another trick.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.722
I learned.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.261
Take a seat.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.233
- [chuckles nervously]

23:54.333 --> 23:55.868
I hope it won't hurt.

23:55.902 --> 23:57.570
- It won't hurt.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.275
And on the count of three.

24:03.375 --> 24:06.078
One, two, three.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.347
And voilà!

24:08.414 --> 24:10.583
- [speaks French approvingly]

24:10.683 --> 24:13.452
Houdini himself
could not have done it better.

24:13.553 --> 24:20.760
* *

24:29.969 --> 24:31.904
[door closes]

24:58.965 --> 25:00.466
- Thank you.

25:04.604 --> 25:06.739
- It is very intimate.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.641
- I gather you mean
it's not Delmonico's,

25:08.741 --> 25:10.910
and I entirely know your point,
but you see,

25:10.977 --> 25:13.345
I quite like to dine alone
on occasion.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.815
- As do I.

25:17.316 --> 25:18.785
To what shall we drink?

25:18.818 --> 25:20.853
- Let us drink
to getting drunk.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.088
- [laughs]

25:22.154 --> 25:23.923
I'm not entirely sure
that is possible.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.859
I do not like to--
- To lose control?

25:26.959 --> 25:28.661
- [laughs]

25:28.695 --> 25:31.831
Behave indelicately.

25:31.931 --> 25:32.965
Santé.

25:35.201 --> 25:38.304
- Your message sounded urgent.

25:38.337 --> 25:41.841
- Yes.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.843
Truth be told,
I've reached an impasse

25:43.943 --> 25:46.512
and I thought you might shake
some of the rocks free.

25:46.545 --> 25:50.116
- With a patient?

25:50.182 --> 25:54.286
- A criminal investigation,
actually.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.655
The perpetrator
is a young woman

25:55.688 --> 25:58.124
who has kidnapped
several infants

25:58.190 --> 26:00.026
and at least killed one.

26:00.126 --> 26:01.861
- Infanticide?

26:01.894 --> 26:05.197
How unusual.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.999
- She's progressed.

26:15.307 --> 26:18.210
[low music]

26:18.310 --> 26:24.150
* *

26:24.216 --> 26:25.251
In truth...

26:25.351 --> 26:28.420
* *

26:28.520 --> 26:29.922
There are facets
of the female mind

26:30.022 --> 26:33.760
I find very difficult to grasp.

26:33.860 --> 26:36.395
- Am I to be your subject
or your sounding board?

26:36.428 --> 26:39.531
- [laughs]

26:39.565 --> 26:42.935
The latter, of course.

26:43.035 --> 26:47.239
But I'm puzzled to no end
by the actions of this woman.

26:47.339 --> 26:48.440
Once I think
I've gotten a handle

26:48.540 --> 26:50.009
of her motivations, she--

26:50.076 --> 26:52.779
- She surprises you?

26:52.879 --> 26:54.213
- Yes.

26:54.246 --> 27:01.220
*

27:01.253 --> 27:02.922
Exactly.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.424
Yes.

27:05.457 --> 27:11.964
*

27:12.064 --> 27:14.701
That is why I thought
it would be invigorating

27:14.767 --> 27:17.770
to engage on this...

27:17.804 --> 27:19.706
with a colleague.

27:19.772 --> 27:23.542
* *

27:23.609 --> 27:24.811
- A colleague.

27:27.579 --> 27:29.248
- [laughs nervously]

27:29.281 --> 27:36.222
*

27:37.623 --> 27:39.291
Another toast.

27:39.325 --> 27:42.795
What shall we drink to
this time, Professor Stratton?

27:44.396 --> 27:47.599
- To collaboration.

27:47.633 --> 27:49.301
[glasses clink]

27:49.335 --> 27:53.973
*

27:54.073 --> 27:57.109
[clock ticking]

28:02.514 --> 28:09.789
*

28:13.860 --> 28:16.996
[laughter and chatter]

28:17.096 --> 28:22.268
* *

28:22.334 --> 28:24.303
- Sara.
- Cyrus.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.138
I need to find Libby Hatch.

28:26.172 --> 28:29.141
You said she was involved
with the Dusters with Goo Goo.

28:29.175 --> 28:31.110
- Please, go home.

28:31.177 --> 28:33.846
Look, the only Duster here
is Fat Jack over there.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.682
[ragtime music playing]

28:36.783 --> 28:38.384
[glasses clatter loudly]

28:38.484 --> 28:40.019
[sighs]
Hey!

28:40.052 --> 28:42.021
Please, Sara.
It's late.

28:42.121 --> 28:44.991
* *

28:45.024 --> 28:47.359
All right, enough of that.
Enough!

28:47.459 --> 28:48.861
- I can help.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.629
- Joanna, I don't wanna get you
into trouble.

28:50.696 --> 28:52.698
- I'd like to help you, Sara.

28:52.799 --> 28:56.535
I know who can lead us
to Goo Goo.

28:56.568 --> 28:59.839
[laughter and chatter]

29:10.216 --> 29:13.052
[laughter, dog growling]

29:13.152 --> 29:14.753
[dark music]

29:14.854 --> 29:20.092

29:23.229 --> 29:27.199
* *

29:27.233 --> 29:30.069
[dogs barking]

29:30.102 --> 29:32.671
- All right.
Who gets to play?

29:32.738 --> 29:34.406
[glass shatters]

29:34.506 --> 29:37.743
[chatter and barking continues]

29:40.679 --> 29:43.916
[men shouting indistinctly]

29:46.352 --> 29:47.553
- That's Goo Goo Knox.

29:47.586 --> 29:50.422
*

29:50.456 --> 29:51.790
Oh, my God.
It's Libby.

29:51.891 --> 29:58.931

30:02.034 --> 30:05.737
- What's the matter?
Huh?

30:05.771 --> 30:09.275
Baby makes you happy, don't it?

30:09.375 --> 30:12.578
- Something's different.

30:12.611 --> 30:16.815
I don't think that she thinks
that...

30:16.916 --> 30:18.317
that I'm her mom.

30:18.417 --> 30:19.618
- No, not this again.

30:19.651 --> 30:26.725
*

30:27.226 --> 30:29.261
You know I'd do anything
for you.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.630
I'd kill for you.

30:31.730 --> 30:34.133
- That's so sweet, Goo Goo.

30:34.233 --> 30:41.273
* *

30:43.775 --> 30:45.811
- Whatever you want.
What do you want, huh?

30:45.912 --> 30:47.079
We can get you a new one.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.781
- No, I don't--
I don't want any baby.

30:49.815 --> 30:52.851
I want my baby.

30:52.952 --> 30:56.288
* *

30:56.322 --> 30:58.590
- I thought I was your baby.
- [chuckles]

30:58.657 --> 31:02.128
* *

31:02.161 --> 31:04.330
- Is that your way
of asking me something?

31:04.363 --> 31:05.497
- Oh, you know it is.

31:05.531 --> 31:12.804
*

31:23.950 --> 31:25.551
- You want a go, don't you?

31:25.651 --> 31:27.353
- [exhales]

31:27.453 --> 31:32.324

31:32.358 --> 31:34.326
Come to your mama.

[moans]

31:41.968 --> 31:48.007

31:52.711 --> 31:53.712
- I need you to get a message

31:53.745 --> 31:54.981
to John Moore and Dr. Kreizler.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.415
- I'm not leaving you here
alone.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.484
- It's vital that we enlist
all the help we can get

31:58.550 --> 31:59.551
as soon as possible.

31:59.585 --> 32:03.755
[tense music]

32:03.822 --> 32:06.058
- Be careful, Sara.

[string quartet playing]

32:13.499 --> 32:14.433
- [laughs]

32:14.500 --> 32:16.735
- You said you were ours
tonight,

32:16.768 --> 32:17.936
not the paper's.

32:18.004 --> 32:19.871
- [clears throat]

32:19.938 --> 32:22.108
- It's your turn.
Ask a question.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.609
- What sort of question?

32:23.709 --> 32:25.777
- Well, to get to an answer
about who you are.

32:25.877 --> 32:27.113
- Ah.

32:27.213 --> 32:29.248
Well, the only answer
that I require

32:29.281 --> 32:31.683
is how "The New York Times"
manages to poach

32:31.750 --> 32:34.686
so many stories
from right under our nose.

32:34.753 --> 32:37.189
* *

32:37.256 --> 32:38.957
- Well, it's a matter
of being in the right place

32:39.058 --> 32:40.792
at the most opportune time,
I suppose.

32:40.892 --> 32:42.628
- Ah.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.296
The responsibility
of the journalist

32:44.396 --> 32:45.864
is to report the news,
but, uh,

32:45.931 --> 32:48.800
John seems to prefer
taking part in its creation.

32:48.900 --> 32:52.538
[both laugh]

32:52.604 --> 32:55.141
- There's a person to see you,
sir.

32:55.241 --> 32:56.975
- A "person," Maurice?

32:57.043 --> 32:58.944
- Not a gentleman or a lady?

32:58.977 --> 33:00.279
You've intrigued us.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.981
Bring this mysterious creature
to the table.

33:03.049 --> 33:05.151
- It's a matter
of some discretion.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.953
- More a matter of urgency
than discretion.

33:07.986 --> 33:11.557
[guests gasp,
chatter stops]

33:11.623 --> 33:13.592
- Perhaps you can find
a more discreet spot

33:13.659 --> 33:16.762
to talk shop.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.164
- Sorry about that, Joanna.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.099
- [sighs] It's Sara.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.168
She's found Libby Hatch.

33:22.268 --> 33:23.502
She's following her.

33:23.602 --> 33:24.803
- On her own?

33:24.836 --> 33:25.937
Where--where was she last?

33:26.004 --> 33:27.806
- Duster territory.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.841
- Hudson Street.

33:29.908 --> 33:32.844
I know where she's going.

33:32.944 --> 33:34.246
There's a telephone here.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.581
I need you to call Kreizler.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.616
Tell him to meet me
at this address.

33:37.683 --> 33:40.652
The Isaacsons too.
We may need the firepower.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.925
[indistinct conversations
and laughter]

33:46.992 --> 33:48.427
Darling, I must leave.

33:48.494 --> 33:51.163
- I don't know why you insist
on being involved, John.

33:51.197 --> 33:55.000
Why not leave these matters
to the police?

33:55.033 --> 33:57.136
- Surely you would want me
to stop a violent criminal

33:57.203 --> 33:58.370
if I was able.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.705
Imagine if they were
our little ones

33:59.805 --> 34:03.775
and some madwoman
was on the loose.

34:03.842 --> 34:05.377
- Off with you, then.

34:05.444 --> 34:08.046
Go and catch
this loathsome killer.

34:08.114 --> 34:15.354
* *

34:16.222 --> 34:17.523
- I had to earn the right

34:17.556 --> 34:19.691
to live above the rules,
my boy.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.693
It had better be a scoop
you're after.

34:23.729 --> 34:26.732
[tense music]

34:26.798 --> 34:33.839
* *

34:48.487 --> 34:51.022
- I have heard no end
of complaints about this woman

34:51.089 --> 34:53.259
and her investigative methods.

34:53.359 --> 34:56.428
Moore follows her around
like a sick puppy.

34:56.528 --> 34:59.498
Leaving dinner so abruptly...

34:59.565 --> 35:02.734
[laughs]

35:02.768 --> 35:05.271
Well, frankly, Byrnes,
it's humiliating.

35:09.107 --> 35:12.278
- Scandalous lady detective...

35:12.344 --> 35:15.447
bent on undermining
the sacred bonds of family

35:15.547 --> 35:20.186
with untraditional friendships
with working women

35:20.252 --> 35:23.422
and unavailable men.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.123
That's a story that
maybe you'll wanna run

35:25.224 --> 35:27.959
in the "Journal," Mr. Hearst.

35:28.059 --> 35:29.695

Making a house call.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.622

38:43.655 --> 38:47.325
Must pay pretty good,
these house calls.

at a disadvantage, Mr...

39:38.309 --> 39:39.878
- They call me Fat Jack.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.481
What kinda doctoring do you do?

39:42.548 --> 39:45.383
- I tend to the health
of the mind.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.786
- How's that work?

39:47.853 --> 39:50.722
- Take your name.
"Fat Jack."

39:50.822 --> 39:52.724
An unlikely appellation
based on your physique.

39:52.791 --> 39:55.461
- [laughs]
Yeah, I ain't fat.

39:55.527 --> 39:56.828
It's a joke.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.730
Everyone calls me that.

39:58.830 --> 40:02.200
- Prescribed names
can be inspired by affection.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.368
But more often than not,

40:03.401 --> 40:05.871
it serves
a paradoxical intention.

40:05.904 --> 40:09.040
What might seem like a tribute
is, in fact, a true reflection

40:09.074 --> 40:11.843
of one's disdain.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.178
- That so?

40:13.244 --> 40:16.181

who helped to find her.

43:04.883 --> 43:06.184
Not myself alone.

43:06.251 --> 43:07.485
- You're being modest.

43:07.552 --> 43:09.520
It was you
who championed this case.

43:09.587 --> 43:12.523
She's safe because of you.

- Yesterday.

Day's behind us now.

44:26.231 --> 44:27.565
- Well,

44:27.598 --> 44:31.903
there's no harm in
acknowledging one's successes.

44:31.970 --> 44:34.740
- Nor one's failures,
I suppose.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.681
- What I said,

44:43.749 --> 44:46.484
I did so
because I wanted to hurt you

44:46.584 --> 44:50.255
just as you had hurt me.

44:50.321 --> 44:51.790
- I know.

- I'm deeply sorry.

44:57.262 --> 45:00.198

45:00.265 --> 45:02.200
- Too often,
things said in anger

45:02.267 --> 45:04.870
come from a place of...

45:04.936 --> 45:07.672
of affection.

45:07.773 --> 45:10.942
And what should be spoken
out loud

45:11.009 --> 45:13.644
is left unuttered.

45:13.711 --> 45:17.315
And life is too short for that,
