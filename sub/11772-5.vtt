00:21.200 --> 00:23.300
ALL RIGHT, MR. DAVID.
WHAT'S THIS CALL REGARDING?

00:23.333 --> 00:26.433
UH, HE-- HE'LL KNOW
WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
I'M A CLIENT.

00:26.467 --> 00:29.533
GOT THAT, BUT WHAT
IS THE CALL REGARDING?

00:29.567 --> 00:32.600
- YOU KNOW, TO BE HONEST,
IT'S KIND OF PERSONAL.
- I'M SURE IT IS.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.000
YOU CAN'T SPEAK TO HIM
UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHAT
THIS IS REGARDING.

00:35.033 --> 00:37.300
BUT IT HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.
IT HAS TO DO WITH HIM.

00:37.333 --> 00:38.867
I DON'T REALLY WANNA
TELL YOU WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.933
SIR, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO CONTROL YOUR LEVELS

00:40.967 --> 00:43.700
- AND TELL ME WHAT
THIS CALL IS REGARDING.

00:43.733 --> 00:45.900

OF YOUR LAST CONVERSATION.

00:45.933 --> 00:48.000
THAT'S NONE

01:04.400 --> 01:07.200
( hisses )

01:11.067 --> 01:13.200

01:19.167 --> 01:20.767

01:20.800 --> 01:24.700
- Hey, what's up?

01:24.733 --> 01:27.467
Oh, Jeez.

02:30.167 --> 02:31.933
I'D LIKE, UM...

02:31.967 --> 02:33.800

02:33.833 --> 02:37.067

AND A DIET COKE.

02:37.067 --> 02:39.900
Sir, are you
in a car?

02:39.933 --> 02:42.167
NO.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.167
Sir, this is
a drive-thru line.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.967
You have to be
in a car to order.

02:46.067 --> 02:48.767
- WHAT'S DIFFERENCE?
- It's our policy.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.067
- This is a drive-thru line.
- ( horn beeps )

02:51.067 --> 02:53.133
ONE SECOND!
COME ON, I'M STARVING.

02:53.167 --> 02:55.333
THERE'S NO-- EVERYTHING--
EVERYTHING'S CLOSED.

02:55.367 --> 02:57.900
- I wish
I could help you, sir.
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

02:57.933 --> 03:00.533
COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
THEY WON'T LET ME
ORDER ANY FOOD

03:00.567 --> 03:02.433
UNLESS I'M IN A CAR.
WILL YOU--

03:05.067 --> 03:07.433
THEY WON'T LET ME ORDER
ANY FOOD UNLESS I'M IN A CAR.

03:07.467 --> 03:09.633
- WOULD YOU MIND IF I--
- Woman: NO, I'M SORRY.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.733
- ( window whirrs )
- THANKS.

03:14.200 --> 03:17.133
I'M SO SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.
I'M TRYING TO GET SOME FOOD.

03:17.167 --> 03:20.133
THEY WON'T LET ME ORDER
UNLESS I'M IN A CAR.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.867
- NO KIDDING.
- IT'S CRAZY.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.267
HUH? IT'S JUST INSANE.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.900
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
- YEAH.

03:26.933 --> 03:28.933
- GET IN.
- REALLY?

03:28.967 --> 03:30.867
- GET IN THE CAR.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.067
I TELL YOU, PETE,

03:38.100 --> 03:41.167
- SHOULD HAVE
GOT THE JUMBO JACK.
- DO YOURSELF A FAVOR--

03:41.200 --> 03:43.100
- YEAH.
- THE NEXT TIME
YOU COME THROUGH,

03:43.133 --> 03:45.267
- GO FOR THE BACON BACON
CHEESEBURGER
- HUH.

03:45.300 --> 03:48.200
AND THE ASIAN SALAD.
A STRANGE COMBINATION,

03:48.233 --> 03:51.167
BUT IT GOES DOWN EASY,
AND IT COMES OUT FAST.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.333
( laughing )
I DON'T NEED
TO TELL YOU MORE.

03:56.500 --> 04:00.300
- MMM.
- WHAT KIND OF WORK
YOU DO, PETE?

04:00.333 --> 04:03.233
GOOD QUESTION.
I'M IN--

04:03.267 --> 04:05.233
I'M IN A TRANSITION
AT THE MOMENT.

04:05.267 --> 04:07.433
I'M--
( clears throat )

04:07.467 --> 04:11.100
- I WAS INVOLVED
IN THE DENTAL FIELD...
- DENTAL FIELD?

04:11.133 --> 04:13.900
- FOR ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS.
- WHAT'D YOU DO IN THE
DENTAL FIELD?

04:13.933 --> 04:16.733
UH, I WORKED ALONGSIDE
A DENTAL HYGIENIST.

04:16.767 --> 04:19.067
REALLY?
WHAT DOES SOMEBODY DO

04:19.067 --> 04:21.333
WORKING ALONGSIDE
A DENTAL HYGIENIST?

04:22.667 --> 04:26.100
I WATCHED AND WORKED CLOSELY
WITH A DENTAL HYGIENIST.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.667
HMM.

04:28.700 --> 04:31.433
- AND--
- AND WHAT HAPPENED?

04:31.467 --> 04:33.500
UM, WE RAN
INTO SOME PROBLEMS.

04:33.533 --> 04:36.867
AND I PREFER
TO LEAVE IT AT THAT.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.600
- OKAY.
- I FOUND MYSELF...

04:39.633 --> 04:41.767
DRAWN TO LANDSCAPING WORK.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.367
IT'S--
IT'S-- IT'S--

04:44.400 --> 04:46.567
IT'S A SLOW TRANSITION.
I'M-- I'M--

04:46.600 --> 04:47.667
- YOU GOT SOME...
- HUH?

04:47.700 --> 04:49.500
- SOME PORNO BACK THERE?
- YEAH--

04:49.533 --> 04:51.867
NO, THAT'S NOT MINE.
THAT WAS--

04:51.900 --> 04:54.167
THAT WAS LEFT BY A COUPLE
OF MY CO-WORKERS.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.067
- BOY, THAT'S QUITE
A COLLECTION.
- YEAH.

04:56.100 --> 04:58.800
WELL, I HAD NO IDEA

04:58.833 --> 05:00.967
THAT THAT WAS THERE.
( laughs )

05:01.067 --> 05:03.233
I-- THAT'S NOT MINE
TO BEGIN WITH, SO...

05:05.667 --> 05:07.567
I FIND IT ALL--

05:07.600 --> 05:09.800
- OH, HEY!
- Pete: JESUS!

05:09.833 --> 05:11.667
- HEY.
- YOU READY TO GO?

05:11.700 --> 05:13.567
SCARED THE HELL

( laughs )

05:13.600 --> 05:15.267
- THIS IS PETE.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.633

05:16.667 --> 05:18.300

- THANK YOU FOR
HELPING OUT MY FRIEND.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.100
OKAY.

05:20.133 --> 05:24.667
- SO ARE YOU INVOLVED
IN "SEINFELD" AS WELL?
- NO. NO NO NO.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.433
HOW DO YOU FELLAS
KNOW EACH OTHER?

05:26.467 --> 05:29.067
- MMPH--
- HE'S MY MANAGER.

05:29.067 --> 05:31.167
- I'M HIS MANAGER.
- OKAY.

05:31.200 --> 05:35.100
- OH, MAN. JUMBO JACK.
- DID I TELL YOU? HUH?

05:35.133 --> 05:36.533
- BEST THING EVER!
- HOW UNBELIEVABLE IS THAT?

05:36.567 --> 05:38.200
UNBELIEVABLE.

05:38.233 --> 05:40.967
I'M SORRY,

05:41.067 --> 05:43.500
BUT I GOT SOME BAD NEWS.

05:43.533 --> 05:45.900
- OH. LEWIS?

05:45.933 --> 05:48.733
- AH.

05:48.767 --> 05:52.400

- YEAH, BOTH OF THEM.

05:52.433 --> 05:55.533
- HE'S GONNA NEED
A NEW ONE.
- OH, WELL,

05:55.567 --> 05:59.267
- IS THERE A DONOR?
- I DON'T KNOW.

05:59.300 --> 06:02.133
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO?

06:02.167 --> 06:03.533
I DON'T KNOW.

06:03.567 --> 06:06.600
HE'S GOTTA FIND
SOMEBODY WHO CAN--

06:06.633 --> 06:09.933
WHO CAN MATCH.
HOPEFULLY, HE KNOWS
SOMEBODY WHO'S...

06:09.967 --> 06:11.600
GOT THE RIGHT
KIDNEY FOR HIM

06:11.633 --> 06:13.300
AND THEN IT'S
A WHOLE PROCESS
OF-- YOU KNOW,

06:13.333 --> 06:15.933
FIRST, THE PERSON WHO--
HAS TO BE TESTED,

06:15.967 --> 06:18.767
AND THEN IF THEY HAVE
THE RIGHT KIDNEY, THEN
THEY HAVE THE SURGERY...

06:22.667 --> 06:25.200
- CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
- YEAH.

06:25.233 --> 06:27.467
NO DONOR. NO DONOR.

06:29.067 --> 06:30.733
( gasps )
OH, GOD.

06:30.767 --> 06:32.733

06:32.767 --> 06:34.633
WITH ALL
THE PEOPLE I KNOW.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.900
OH, GOD.

06:36.933 --> 06:39.767
WHAT ABOUT YOUR RELATIVES?
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IT

06:39.800 --> 06:41.700
'CAUSE THEY HAVE
THE SAME BLOOD
AND ALL THAT.

06:41.733 --> 06:44.900
DIDN'T YOU HAVE SOME
IDIOT COUSIN LIVING
OUT HERE OR SOMETHING?

06:44.933 --> 06:47.833

- LOUIS LEWIS.

06:47.867 --> 06:50.067
- PLEASE.
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

06:50.067 --> 06:52.067
MIGHT AS WELL BE CALLED
MANSON MANSON.

06:52.067 --> 06:55.167
HE'S A NUTCASE.
HE'S-- HE WORKS AT
JACK IN THE BOX AND--

06:55.200 --> 06:57.667
JACK IN THE BOX.
I WAS JUST THERE
THE OTHER NIGHT.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.833
HAD A JUMBO JACK--
PRETTY GOOD.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.867
I'M GLAD
YOU LIKED IT.

07:03.900 --> 07:06.367
SO DID YOU ASK
THIS LOUIS LEWIS?
WHAT DID HE SAY?

07:06.400 --> 07:10.067
HE WANTS TO DONATE
ALL HIS ORGANS
AFTER HE DIES,

07:10.067 --> 07:11.533
BUT NOT A MINUTE BEFORE.

07:11.567 --> 07:13.600
THANK YOU, LOUIS LEWIS.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.267
DOESN'T HELP ME ANY.
SCHMUCK.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.667
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET
ON THAT KIDNEY LIST

07:18.700 --> 07:20.667
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.500
SHIT.

07:22.533 --> 07:25.467
I MEAN, THE ONLY
OTHER OPTION IS IF--

07:25.500 --> 07:27.867
YOU KNOW, IF A--
YOU KNOW, IF A--
IF A GOOD FRIEND

07:27.900 --> 07:29.400
OR A BUDDY COMES THROUGH.
THEN I'M-- YOU KNOW,

07:29.433 --> 07:32.067
THEN I'M GOLDEN.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.067
HMM.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.367
( sighs )

07:41.700 --> 07:43.633
Larry: I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

07:43.667 --> 07:46.967
JUST THE TEST
ISN'T GONNA HURT YOU.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.500
I GOTTA CHOOSE
HEALTHIER FRIENDS.

07:50.533 --> 07:52.600
THIS IS NO GOOD.

07:52.633 --> 07:55.100
THE NEXT TIME
THERE'S ANY SIGN
OF ANYTHING WRONG

07:55.133 --> 07:58.100
WITH ANY OF MY FRIENDS--
IF I THINK THEY'RE GONNA
BE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL,

07:58.133 --> 08:00.267
ANY SIGN OF ANYTHING,
I'M JUST--

08:00.300 --> 08:02.767
- I'M JUST GONNA DROP THEM
LIKE A HOT POTATO.
- SMART.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.733
AND YOU TOO.
I MEAN, AS SOON
AS YOU GET SICK,

08:04.767 --> 08:06.700
- I'M OUT.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
- OH, WELL,

08:06.733 --> 08:09.067
I'M GLAD YOU'RE
BRINGING IT UP
'CAUSE IT'S--

08:09.067 --> 08:11.633
- WELL, I MEAN, COME ON.
- NO, IT'S NICE TO KNOW.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.367
- YEAH, AND I'M GIVING YOU--
- ALTHOUGH, I THOUGHT

08:13.400 --> 08:15.900
THAT THAT'S WHAT
THE WHOLE DEAL WAS.

08:15.933 --> 08:18.400
- IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
YOU GET MARRIED.
- NORMALLY,

08:18.433 --> 08:20.100
THAT IS THE DEAL,
BUT WE--

08:20.133 --> 08:22.567
WE'RE LOSING THE SICKNESS
AND HEATH CLAUSE.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.700
- I'M OUT IF ANYTHING'S
WRONG WITH YOU.
- OKAY.

08:24.733 --> 08:26.700
- AND LOOK,
SAME FOR YOU.
- THANK YOU.

08:26.733 --> 08:28.167
- YOU GO TOO, AS SOON AS--
- I WILL.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.367
- OKAY?
- OKAY.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.800
- I CAN'T BE AROUND ILLNESS.
- BUT FOR NOW?

08:31.833 --> 08:34.167
- FREAKS ME OUT, OKAY?
- BUT FOR NOW?

08:36.433 --> 08:38.233
IT'LL BE SUCH
A NICE GESTURE

08:38.267 --> 08:40.333
AND HE'D REALLY
APPRECIATE IT.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.733
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TAKE THE TEST.

08:44.767 --> 08:47.133
- I THINK YOU'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.
- YEAH, GREAT.

08:47.167 --> 08:49.667
- HE'S GOING TO FEEL
VERY GOOD ABOUT THAT.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

08:49.700 --> 08:52.067
YOU'RE A VERY SWEET FRIEND.

08:52.067 --> 08:54.067
IT'S VERY SWEET.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.667
- GOOD NIGHT.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:57.700 --> 08:59.400
HOW 'BOUT
A NICE SNUGGLE HERE?

08:59.433 --> 09:02.333
I KNOW, BUT YOUR SNUGGLE
ALWAYS LEADS TO SEX.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.800
SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
WHY SHOULDN'T IT LEAD TO SEX?

09:04.833 --> 09:08.267
SOMETIMES YOU JUST WANT
TO SNUGGLE AND YOU DON'T
WANT TO HAVE SEX.

09:08.300 --> 09:11.500
WHAT'S THE ADVANTAGE
OF THAT?

09:11.533 --> 09:13.767
BECAUSE IT'S NICE.
YOU CONNECT

09:13.800 --> 09:16.533
AND IT'S WARM
AND SWEET.

09:16.567 --> 09:19.600
- OKAY, LET'S JUST SNUGGLE.
- YOU CAN DO THAT?

09:19.633 --> 09:21.167
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
- WITHOUT IT TURNING
INTO ANYTHING?

09:21.200 --> 09:25.767
- YEAH, WE'LL JUST SNUGGLE.
- SEE? IT'S SWEET.
THAT'S NICE.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.767
SEE...

09:27.800 --> 09:29.333
HOW NICE IT IS?

09:29.367 --> 09:31.867
- OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT? WHAT?!

09:31.900 --> 09:34.533
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?!

09:34.567 --> 09:37.733
- THE ASS IS PART
OF MY SNUGGLE.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

09:37.767 --> 09:41.767
- IT IS!
- OKAY, THEN GOOD NIGHT.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.867
WE'LL SNUGGLE
ANOTHER TIME.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.933
- IT'S JUST--
IT'S JUST A LEVER.
- GOOD NIGHT.

09:46.967 --> 09:49.900
I'M USING THE ASS
AS A LEVER TO DRAW YOU IN.

09:49.933 --> 09:51.433
THAT'S ALL.

09:51.467 --> 09:54.200
( stammers )
AND IT GETS--
THE SNUGGLE TIGHTER.

09:54.233 --> 09:56.200
GOOD NIGHT.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.933
( phone rings )

10:08.967 --> 10:11.900
- RICHARD LEWIS'S OFFICE.
- Larry David calling.

10:11.933 --> 10:14.567
SURE.
WHAT'S THIS REGARDING?

10:14.600 --> 10:18.367
IT'S REGARDING
HIS KIDNEY TRANSPLANT.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.933
WHAT?

10:19.967 --> 10:22.800
IT'S REGARDING
HIS KIDNEY TRANSPLANT.

10:22.833 --> 10:26.167
MR. LEWIS IS GETTING
A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT?

10:27.467 --> 10:29.233
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

10:29.267 --> 10:31.000
He didn't say anything
to me about it.

10:31.033 --> 10:33.700
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
- OH MY GOD!

10:33.733 --> 10:36.733
- ( sobbing )
- He didn't tell you this?

10:36.767 --> 10:40.067
He didn't tell you
that there was a problem
with his kidneys?

10:40.100 --> 10:42.433
- NO, HE DIDN'T
TELL ME ANYTHING!
- HOW COULD HE HAVE NOT

10:42.467 --> 10:45.600
- TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS?!
- I don't know, but he didn't
tell me anything about this!

10:45.633 --> 10:48.700
OH JEEZ. YOU ASKED ME
WHAT IT WAS REGARDING!

10:48.733 --> 10:51.333
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT
SOMETHING LIKE THIS!

10:51.367 --> 10:55.000
BUT I-- I WOULDN'T
HAVE SAID ANYTHING!
YOU

10:55.033 --> 10:57.400
I could have sworn he--
I figured he told you!

10:57.433 --> 10:58.900
HE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING TO ME.

10:58.933 --> 11:01.067
OH MY GOD.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.800
- TAKE IT EASY.
- No.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.267
COULD YOU TELL HIM
I CALLED?

11:08.300 --> 11:10.467
- Okay.
- THANKS.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.133
Richard:
WHAT DID YOU
DO TO MY ASSISTANT?

11:15.167 --> 11:16.967
- Larry: WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

11:17.067 --> 11:20.700
SHE'S FREAKED OUT,
HAVING A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN,
AND MIGHT EVEN QUIT.

11:20.733 --> 11:22.400
IT'S UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

11:22.433 --> 11:24.567
SHE ASKED ME
WHAT THE CALL
WAS REGARDING!

11:24.600 --> 11:27.767
- IT'S PERSONAL!
- SHE ASKED WHAT IT'S
REGARDING, I TOLD HER!

11:27.800 --> 11:30.567
JEEZ,
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
SHE WAS A BASKET CASE.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.567
CHRIST'S SAKE.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.233
WHAT AM I
GOING TO DO?

11:34.267 --> 11:36.433
HEY, UM, FIRST OF ALL,

11:36.467 --> 11:38.400
I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT,
UH...

11:41.067 --> 11:43.067
I THOUGHT ABOUT
OUR CONVERSATION
AND, UH...

11:43.067 --> 11:44.767
( clears throat )

11:44.800 --> 11:47.767
I'LL, UH,
I'LL TAKE THE TEST.

11:49.867 --> 11:52.600
- BIG FUCKING DEAL.
- THAT'S IT?!

11:52.633 --> 11:55.767
I MEAN, YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
YOU SHOULD HAVE JUMPED
RIGHT ON IT.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.900
YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT,
BUT I'M MAKING UP--

11:57.933 --> 11:59.800
I'M MAKING IT UP NOW.
I'LL TAKE THE TEST.

11:59.833 --> 12:03.133
JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND THINK IF IT WAS REVERSED
YOU'D BE REALLY BUMMED OUT.

12:03.167 --> 12:06.633
LET ME DO THAT.
I'M CLOSING MY EYES,
BUT NOW I'M ASKING YOU--

12:06.667 --> 12:08.767
THE SITUATION'S REVERSED.
I NEED THE KIDNEY.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.333
- YEAH?
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

12:10.367 --> 12:11.933
WOULD YOU TAKETHE TEST?

12:11.967 --> 12:14.700
- I'D PROBABLY
WANT TO LEAP AT IT.
- PROBABLY LEAP AT IT?

12:14.733 --> 12:16.600
- I--
- YOU'D LEAP
OUT THE WINDOW.

12:16.633 --> 12:20.467
- LET ME SAY THIS: I WOULD HAVE
GONE ON RECORD AT THE DELI.
- ( phone rings )

12:20.500 --> 12:22.333
HELLO.
( clears throat )

12:22.367 --> 12:24.267
YEAH, THIS IS
LARRY DAVID.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.633
UM...

12:26.667 --> 12:29.433
YEAH, I WAS AT
A JACK IN THE BOX.

12:29.467 --> 12:31.667
YEAH. PETE.

12:31.700 --> 12:34.567
OH, CHRIST.
REALLY?

12:34.600 --> 12:43.233
WELL, WHAT'S THE ADDRESS?

12:43.267 --> 12:45.133
SO, UM, YOU KNOW,

12:45.167 --> 12:47.133
I'VE DECIDED
TO TAKE THE TEST.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.333
- THE KIDNEY TEST FOR LEWIS?
- OH, GOOD FOR YOU.

12:50.367 --> 12:52.333
THAT'S REALLY NOBLE.

12:52.367 --> 12:54.267
- IT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.
- YEAH.

12:54.300 --> 12:57.600
- ABSOLUTELY.
- ABSOLUTELY.

12:57.633 --> 13:00.167
I WAS KIND OF WONDERING
WHY YOU'RE NOT DOING IT.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.233
WHY SHOULD I DO IT?

13:02.267 --> 13:05.067
YOU'RE HIS MANAGER.
YOU'RE HIS FRIEND.
WHY SHOULDN'T YOU DO IT?

13:05.067 --> 13:08.867
A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO HAVE MANAGERS
AND FRIENDS NEED KIDNEYS.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.700
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

13:10.733 --> 13:12.633
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.267
- YOU'RE HIS FRIEND.
YOU'RE HIS MANAGER.
- YEAH YEAH?

13:14.300 --> 13:16.733
YOU'RE CLOSE TO HIM.
YOU SHOULD BE TAKING
THE TEST TOO.

13:16.767 --> 13:18.767
YOU'RE HIS OLDEST
AND CLOSEST FRIEND.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.867
SO IT'S A QUESTION
OF LONGEVITY?
THAT'S IT?

13:20.900 --> 13:23.100
YOU'RE HIS OLDEST
AND CLOSEST FRIEND.
THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE.

13:23.133 --> 13:26.500
IF YOU'RE MARRIED
TO YOUR WIFE FOR THREE YEARS
AND I'VE KNOWN HER FOR 20,

13:26.533 --> 13:28.900
WHO SHOULD GIVE
YOUR WIFE THE KIDNEY?
I'VE KNOWN HER LONGER.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.600
BY YOUR LOGIC,
I'M THE ONE WHO SHOULD.

13:31.633 --> 13:33.567
IF MY WIFE NEEDS A KIDNEY,
YOU CAN GIVE IT TO HER.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.967
OH, OKAY, SO IT'S
LONGEVITY NO MATTER WHAT,

13:36.067 --> 13:37.433
EVEN IF YOU'RE
MARRIED TO HER.

13:37.467 --> 13:38.767
NO, I'M SAYING
YOU SEEMED LIKE

13:38.800 --> 13:40.900
YOU WANT TO GIVE HER A KIDNEY,
SO I'M GONNA LET YOU.

13:40.933 --> 13:44.700
YOU KNOW, I'M LOATHE
TO MENTION THIS, OKAY,

13:44.733 --> 13:46.667
BUT YOU ARE
AN EMPLOYEE OF MINE.

13:48.067 --> 13:50.400
OKAY, YOU'RE
REALLY REACHING NOW.

13:50.433 --> 13:51.667
- YOU'RE DESPERATE,
AREN'T YOU?
- A LITTLE.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.233
YEAH, I KNOW.
YOU DON'T WANT TO
GIVE UP YOUR KIDNEY.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.333
- NO, WHY SHOULD I?
- I KNOW. WHY SHOULD I?

13:56.367 --> 13:58.200
- WHY SHOULD I?
- WELL, WHY SHOULD I?

13:58.233 --> 14:01.100
- IF I AM, YOU SHOULD TOO.
- WHEN DID THAT RULE
COME INTO EFFECT?

14:01.133 --> 14:03.067
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?
- IT'S NOT A GOOD RULE.

14:03.067 --> 14:06.433
- IT'S A GOOD RULE.
- YOU HAVE TO DRAW A LINE.
KIDNEYS IS PAST THE LINE.

14:07.567 --> 14:08.667
HEY!

14:08.700 --> 14:11.067
- HEY.
- MR. JONES!

14:11.100 --> 14:13.900
MR. DAVID, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:13.933 --> 14:16.667
OH. IT'S KIND
OF A LONG STORY,

14:16.700 --> 14:19.067
BUT I HAD A
BURGER WITH A--

14:19.100 --> 14:22.067
AT A JACK IN THE BOX
WITH SOME GUY AND NOW
I'M HIS ALIBI.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.400
APPARENTLY,
I'VE GOT TO SPOT HIM
IN A LINE-UP OR SOMETHING.

14:24.433 --> 14:25.933
- I DON'T KNOW.
- RIGHT.

14:25.967 --> 14:28.800
- REALLY, THAT'S
NOT THE ISSUE HERE.
- IT'S TRUE, UH-HUH.

14:28.833 --> 14:31.333
- ACTUALLY, I HAVE A
BONE TO PICK WITH YOU.
- ME?

14:31.367 --> 14:34.967
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
AGAINST RECEPTIONISTS?

14:35.067 --> 14:37.200
I CALLED UP,
I WAS VERY POLITE
AND RESPECTFUL,

14:37.233 --> 14:38.933
AND SHE WANTS TO KNOW
WHAT IT'S REGARDING.

14:38.967 --> 14:42.400
- I DON'T SEE HOW
IT'S HER BUSINESS--
- I HAD TALK HER INTO STAYING.

14:42.433 --> 14:43.933
I'M A PRIVATE EYE,
NOT A PSYCHOLOGIST.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.833
SHE COMES INTO
MY OFFICE CRYING,

14:45.867 --> 14:48.133
YOU KNOW, WONDERING
WHAT'S GOING ON.

14:48.167 --> 14:51.600
- SHE'S A PART OF MY BUSINESS.
THERE'S A CERTAIN FACTOR--
- STILL, IT'S NOT YOU.

14:51.633 --> 14:53.833
I MEAN, WHAT IF YOU
WERE A PSYCHIATRIST

14:53.867 --> 14:55.733
- AND SHE SAID
"WHAT IS IT REGARDING?"
- THERE'S PROTOCOL.

14:55.767 --> 14:58.700
"I'M PLANNING
ON KILLING MYSELF.
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM."

14:58.733 --> 15:01.667
IT HELPS ME SAVE TIME
AND WE ASK THOSE QUESTIONS
SO THAT WE'RE PREPARED

15:01.700 --> 15:03.700
WHEN THE PHONE CALL
DOES GET TO ME.

15:03.733 --> 15:06.167
OKAY. I'M SORRY
IF I DID ANYTHING THAT--

15:06.200 --> 15:09.900
HOPEFULLY WE CAN
WE CAN AVOID THESE
CONFLICTS, YOU KNOW?

15:09.933 --> 15:11.967
HOW'S THE ADOPTION
THING COMING?

15:12.067 --> 15:14.967
I'M WORKING ON SOME THINGS.
I HAVE SOME REALLY NICE LEADS

15:15.067 --> 15:16.600
AND I SHOULD HAVE
SOMETHING TO YOU SOON.

15:16.633 --> 15:18.100
- REALLY? NO KIDDING.
- PRETTY SOON.

15:18.133 --> 15:20.333
- OMAR, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

15:20.367 --> 15:22.367

15:57.433 --> 16:00.367

16:00.400 --> 16:03.933

16:03.967 --> 16:06.867
SECOND FROM THE RIGHT.
THAT'S HIM.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.100
- YOU'RE CERTAIN OF THAT?
- YEAH. PETE.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.667

16:09.700 --> 16:12.400

- 10:15?
- YEAH, 10:15.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.633
- THAT'S A LATE DINNER.

16:18.667 --> 16:21.767
- I SEE.
- DINNER'S BETWEEN
5:00 AND 8:00 GENERALLY.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.067

- YEAH, 5:00 AND 8:00.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.867
YOU COULD STARTAT 8:00 THOUGH.

16:25.900 --> 16:28.067
Ray:
YOU KNOW WHO PETER IS?

16:28.067 --> 16:30.933
HE'S A-- HE WORKED ALONGSIDE
OF A DENTAL HYGIENIST.

16:30.967 --> 16:32.333
I KNOW THAT.

16:32.367 --> 16:35.533
- AND HE DID SOME LANDSCAPING.
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO.

16:35.567 --> 16:38.933
ARE YOU GENTLEMEN
USED TO HANGING OUT
WITH KNOWN FELONS?

16:38.967 --> 16:40.833
'CAUSE NUMBER TWO

16:40.867 --> 16:42.233
AKA PETER THE TORK,

16:42.267 --> 16:45.100

WENDELL THE CONSPIRATOR,

16:45.133 --> 16:48.067

17:12.867 --> 17:15.067
HOW DO I LET YOU

17:15.100 --> 17:17.833
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

17:17.867 --> 17:19.833
WHO NEEDS THIS?

17:23.767 --> 17:25.533
I HAVE GOOD NEWS,
GENTLEMEN.

17:25.567 --> 17:28.567
BOTH OF YOUR BLOOD TYPES
ARE COMPATIBLE WITH MR. LEWIS

17:28.600 --> 17:31.367
FOR HIS KIDNEY TRANSPLANT.

17:31.400 --> 17:34.400
- GOOD NIGHT, NURSE.
- ( phones ringing )

17:34.433 --> 17:36.900
GOOD NIGHT.

17:36.933 --> 17:38.267
IT'S JUST A SAYING.

17:38.300 --> 17:41.433
- I NEVER HEARD OF IT.
- IT'S AN OLD ONE.

17:41.467 --> 17:43.467
- THAT'S NICE.
- IT IS.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.300
- I KNOW IT IS.
- DO YOU?

17:45.333 --> 17:46.933
- DO YOU?
- I DO.

17:46.967 --> 17:48.300
- Nurse: GOOD FOR YOU.
- IT IS GOOD FOR ME.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.067

- I KNOW SO.

17:50.067 --> 17:51.233
- I'M GLAD.
- SO AM I.

17:51.267 --> 17:53.367
- THAT MAKES TWO OF US.
- SO YOU SAY.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.967
SO I DID.

18:11.300 --> 18:14.067
( sighs )
WELL, HOW ARE
WE GONNA DECIDE?

18:14.100 --> 18:15.133
( birds twittering )

18:15.167 --> 18:17.200
WE COULD--

18:17.233 --> 18:18.700
WE COULD PLAY BINGO.

18:18.733 --> 18:20.200
BINGO?

18:20.233 --> 18:22.600
- YOU KNOW, IT'S-- IT'S FAIR.
- ME PLAY YOU IN BINGO?

18:22.633 --> 18:25.400
THAT'S LIKE ASKING ME TO PLAY
GOLF AGAINST TIGER WOODS.
PLAY YOU IN BINGO?

18:25.433 --> 18:28.067
- WHAT? IT'S FAIR--
IT'S A FAIR GAME.
- NO, THANK YOU.

18:28.100 --> 18:31.067

A COUSIN?

18:34.667 --> 18:38.067

18:38.067 --> 18:39.867
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

18:39.900 --> 18:42.600
HE DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE UP
HIS KIDNEY UNTIL HE'S DEAD.

18:42.633 --> 18:45.100
LOUIS LEWIS.

18:45.133 --> 18:47.567
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:47.600 --> 18:50.133
WE'LL LET LEWIS DECIDE.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

18:50.167 --> 18:52.467
FINE, LET LEWIS DECIDE.
YEAH, SURE SURE.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.367
I'LL ABIDE BY HIS DECISION.
WILL YOU?

18:54.400 --> 18:56.200
YEAH, MOST DEFINITELY,
MOST DEFINITELY.

18:56.233 --> 18:58.133

I'M FOR THAT.
- OKAY.

18:58.167 --> 19:01.100
- LET'S SHAKE
ON THAT. OKAY.
- SURE SURE.

19:01.133 --> 19:03.433
SURE.
NO CAMPAIGNING.

19:03.467 --> 19:05.433
- NO. NO CAMPAIGNING.
- NO CAMPAIGNING.

19:05.467 --> 19:07.800
I DON'T WANT TO FIND
OUT YOU'VE BEEN CALLING
HIM UP AND SAYING,

19:07.833 --> 19:11.467
- "OH, HE'S A LOT
THINNER THAN I AM."
- FIND OUT I'VE BEEN SAYING?!

19:11.500 --> 19:13.467
OH, I'M MORE LIKELY
TO DO IT THAN YOU?

19:19.467 --> 19:20.433
HEY.

19:20.467 --> 19:22.467
HEY, MR. DAVID.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.333
UM...

19:24.367 --> 19:26.267
FIRST OF ALL,
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THE OTHER DAY.

19:26.300 --> 19:29.067
I REALLY HAD NO IDEA
THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

19:29.067 --> 19:32.333
I'M-- I NEVER WOULD HAVE
SAID ANYTHING, OBVIOUSLY.

19:34.167 --> 19:35.733
IS HE-- IS HE IN?

19:35.767 --> 19:38.067
HE'S ON THE PHONE
WITH JEFF RIGHT NOW.

19:38.067 --> 19:39.667
AH.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.533
WELL, WHAT'S
IT REGARDING?

19:42.567 --> 19:45.333
- I DON'T KNOW.
- HMM.

19:45.367 --> 19:48.567
- YOU DIDN'T ASK?
- NOPE.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.467
HMM. I WONDER IF HE'S
CAMPAIGNING IN THERE.

19:55.867 --> 19:58.067
OH, JEEZ.

19:58.067 --> 19:59.467
HE DIDN'T EVEN
TELL ME NOW.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.433
NOW, YOU-- YOU WOULD
HAVE FOUND OUT EVENTUALLY.

20:01.467 --> 20:04.433
- NO, YOU--
YOU WOULD HAVE-- OH, JEEZ.
- ( sobbing )

20:04.467 --> 20:06.667
HE'S WAS-- I'M SURE
HE WAS GONNA TELL YOU.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.167
NO, DON'T--
DON'T CRY.

20:08.200 --> 20:11.533
OH, POOR THING.
OH, JEEZ.

20:11.567 --> 20:14.433
OH MY GOSH.
OH DEAR.

20:14.467 --> 20:16.767
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
IT'S OKAY.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.500
DON'T-- DON'T WORRY.
I'M SURE HE WAS
GONNA TELL YOU.

20:19.533 --> 20:22.300
- ( sobbing loudly )
- YEAH, NO, DON'T WORRY.

20:22.333 --> 20:23.933
THERE THERE, IT'S OKAY.

20:23.967 --> 20:26.000
- WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT?

20:26.033 --> 20:28.967
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.167
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?
WHY DID YOU TOUCH MY HAIR?

20:31.200 --> 20:32.700
I WAS CONSOLING.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.667
- I WAS CONSOLING YOU.
- THAT WASN'T CONSOLING.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.633
TOUCHING HAIR IS PART
OF MY CONSOLATION ROUTINE.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.267
NO, IT'S REALLY WEIRD.
YOU'RE BEING REALLY
INAPPROPRIATE.

20:39.300 --> 20:42.033
- WHAT? INAPPROPRIATE?
ARE YOU CRAZY?
- YEAH, YOU WERE.

20:42.067 --> 20:44.300
- HEY, WHAT'S-- WHAT IS THIS?
AGAIN?! AGAIN?!
- ( all chattering )

20:44.333 --> 20:46.033
SHE'S-- SHE'S CRAZY!
I WAS CONSOLING HER!

20:46.067 --> 20:47.800
- HE WAS COMING ON TO ME!
- I WASN'T COMING ON...

20:47.833 --> 20:51.067
- ARE YOU A SOCIOPATH?!
- I WAS CONSOLING HER
AND I TOUCHED HER HAIR.

20:51.100 --> 20:54.100
- NO YOU WEREN'T!
HE WAS COMING ON TO ME!
- THAT'S SUCH BALONEY!

20:54.133 --> 20:55.700
- I'M LEAVING.
- I WAS CONSOLING HER.
I TOUCHED HER HAIR.

20:55.733 --> 20:58.967
- SHE THINKS THAT'S
COMING ON, SHE'S NUTS.
- I'M LEAVING!

20:59.000 --> 21:01.233
WHAT-- WHAT A WHACK JOB.

21:01.267 --> 21:04.267
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
I WAS CONSOLING HER!
I WAS TOUCHING HER HAIR.

21:04.300 --> 21:05.900
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
- MM-HMM.

21:05.933 --> 21:08.567
SHE THINKS I'M COMING ON
TO HER? GET OUT OF HERE.
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.467
- YOU THINK SHE'S
LEAVING OR QUITTING?
- THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.633
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE SAID SHE'S LEAVING.

21:13.667 --> 21:15.700
- OH, WHAT A HASSLE.
- IS THAT LEAVING
OR QUITTING?

21:15.733 --> 21:17.967
- I DON'T KNOW.
- SAME THING HAPPENED
WITH CHERYL.

21:18.067 --> 21:20.300
SHE SAID SHE WAS LEAVING.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS LEAVING ME.

21:20.333 --> 21:22.367
SHE'S JUST GOING OUT
TO HAVE LUNCH WITH
HER FRIEND.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.867
CHERYL-- RIGHT NOW,
LOOK AT THIS-- ARE YOU--

21:24.900 --> 21:27.133
- YOU REALLY
HAVE EVIDENCED...
- WHAT?

21:27.167 --> 21:28.567
...SOME PRETTY
ERRATIC BEHAVIOR.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.900
GET OUT OF HERE.
I WAS TOUCHING HER HAIR.
SHE'S CRAZY.

21:30.933 --> 21:32.867
UNBELIEVABLE.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.133
SO UM...

21:34.167 --> 21:37.667
DID YOU GET THE NEWS?
HUH?

21:37.700 --> 21:39.867
- THANKS. YEAH YEAH.
- HUH? HOW ABOUT THAT?

21:39.900 --> 21:42.167
I'M A LUCKY MAN
TO HAVE TWO OF YOU GUYS

21:42.200 --> 21:43.733
COME THROUGH FOR ME.
THANK YOU.

21:43.767 --> 21:46.767
- HEY, FAR OUT.
- SO THERE YOU GO.
YOU'VE GOT YOUR CHOICE.

21:46.800 --> 21:50.433
- TWO-- TWO KIDNEYS.
- WOW!

21:50.467 --> 21:52.533
- OF COURSE...
- VERY GRATEFUL, MAN.

21:52.567 --> 21:54.633
YOU KNOW, I...

21:54.667 --> 21:56.733
I AM CONSIDERABLY
OLDER THAN HIM.

21:56.767 --> 21:59.667
AND I'M NOT GONNA--
I DON'T WANT TO GET
INTO THAT WHOLE GAME.

21:59.700 --> 22:01.267
BUT, YOU KNOW, HE'S--

22:01.300 --> 22:04.500
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNGER,
OBVIOUSLY.

22:04.533 --> 22:06.200
NAH, A KIDNEY'S
A KIDNEY'S A KIDNEY.

22:06.233 --> 22:09.067
( chuckles )
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT,
BUT YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.

22:09.067 --> 22:12.200
HIS ARE BIGGER TOO.
IT'S A BIG HEFTY KIDNEY,

22:12.233 --> 22:14.633
COULD HANDLE A BIG LOAD
I THINK, YOU KNOW?

22:14.667 --> 22:17.367
YOU COULD START DRINKING
AGAIN IF YOU WANTED
TO WITH THAT THING.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.633
- THAT, UH--
- WELL, IN CASE--

22:19.667 --> 22:21.233
...THAT HURT MY FEELINGS
A LITTLE BIT, BUDDY.

22:21.267 --> 22:23.067
- MAYBE NOT THAT.
- 11 YEARS SOBER.
THANK YOU.

22:23.067 --> 22:26.800
BUT, YOU KNOW, UH...
THAT'S ALL.

22:26.833 --> 22:30.067
OTHER THAN THE FACT
THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S
A LOT ABOUT ME THAT

22:30.067 --> 22:32.567
WHEN I GOT OUT OF COLLEGE,
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

22:32.600 --> 22:33.667
I REALLY DIDN'T
KNOW YOU THEN, SO--

22:33.700 --> 22:35.833
PLEASE, I'VE BEEN
THROUGH EVERYTHING.

22:35.867 --> 22:37.633
WELL, I DON'T THINK
YOU DID WHAT I DID, BUT...

22:37.667 --> 22:40.667
- TRUST ME. TIMES 30.
- UH, YOU'RE NOT REALLY
GETTING MY DRIFT.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.500
- LISTEN, IT--
YOU'RE BOTH A MATCH?
- YEAH.

22:42.533 --> 22:44.267
I DON'T CARE HOW
YOU FIGURE IT OUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:44.300 --> 22:45.400
FLIP A COIN, MAN.

22:45.433 --> 22:48.267

22:51.267 --> 22:53.167

22:53.200 --> 22:56.267
AND STAY AWAY
FROM HER, WILL YOU?

22:56.300 --> 22:58.267
WHACK JOB.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.367
( whispering )
I GOT TO START WITH ME.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.967
EENY MEENY MINEY MOE,
CATCH A TIGER BY THE TOE.
IF HE HOLLERS, LET HIM GO.

23:07.067 --> 23:09.967
MY MOTHER SAYS

AND OUT GOES Y-O-U.

23:10.067 --> 23:12.933

23:14.333 --> 23:16.567
OKAY, I'M GONNA
FLIP THIS COIN

23:16.600 --> 23:18.733
AND THIS WILL BE

EENY MEENY?

23:22.600 --> 23:24.633

23:27.700 --> 23:29.367

23:29.400 --> 23:31.367

23:31.400 --> 23:33.833
- Jeff: ALL RIGHT, GO.
- ALL RIGHT.

23:33.867 --> 23:36.167
AND BEFORE WE GO,
I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING
TO YOU GUYS

23:36.200 --> 23:39.100
AND I MEAN THIS.
I ADMIRE THE BOTH OF YOU.

23:39.133 --> 23:42.367
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS AN UNBELIEVABLE ACT
OF FRIENDSHIP.

23:42.400 --> 23:45.733
I JUST WISH
I HAD A KIDNEY MATCH
SO I COULD BE INVOLVED.

23:45.767 --> 23:47.733
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T
TAKEN THE TEST.

23:47.767 --> 23:49.833
ARE YOU READY
TO DO EENY MEENY?

23:49.867 --> 23:52.467
- YEAH.

TO TAKE THE TEST?

23:52.500 --> 23:55.200
NO, I DON'T THINK
I'M A MATCH ANYWAY.
LET'S JUST DO EENY MEENY.

23:55.233 --> 23:58.133
WHO WANTS TO BE EENY?

23:58.167 --> 24:00.100
- I'LL BE EENY.
- YEAH, YOU CAN BE EENY.

24:00.133 --> 24:01.833
- OKAY.
- HE'LL BE EENY.

24:01.867 --> 24:03.067
HOW COME YOU WANT ME
TO BE EENY?

24:03.067 --> 24:04.700
NO, IT'S GOOD.
YOU SHOULD BE EENY.

24:04.733 --> 24:08.167
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT, RIGHT?
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE EENY?

24:08.200 --> 24:10.667
WANT ME TO BE EENY?
DO YOU WANT ME TO BE EENY?

24:10.700 --> 24:12.567

24:45.767 --> 24:48.133
- YOU GIVE THE KIDNEY.

24:48.167 --> 24:51.200
YOU STUPID IDIOTS!
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
TO PLAY EENY MEENY MINEY MOE.

24:51.233 --> 24:53.733
- WE'RE IDIOTS?!
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO PLAY EENY MEENY?

24:53.767 --> 24:56.433
- YOU DON'T KNOW THE FIRST
THING ABOUT EENY MEENY!

24:56.467 --> 24:58.133
- NO, I'M SAFE.

24:58.167 --> 25:00.067
WHAT THE HELL IS ALL

25:20.800 --> 25:22.867
WHAT ARE WE TALKING

LOSING WHAT?

25:22.900 --> 25:25.167
THEY'RE GIVING A KIDNEY
TO RICHARD LEWIS.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.433
- HE'S THE ONE.
- HE LOST.

25:26.467 --> 25:28.433
EXCUSE ME,
YOU'RE NOT GIVING
YOUR FUCKING KIDNEY.

25:28.467 --> 25:30.233
WHAT IF ONE YOUR KIDS
NEEDS A KIDNEY ONE DAY?

25:30.267 --> 25:32.800
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE A KIDNEY
TO RICHARD LEWIS?
NO NO NO!

25:32.833 --> 25:35.300
- YOU'LL GIVE IT TO 'EM.
- I MIGHT NOT BE THE MATCH.

25:35.333 --> 25:38.433
HE NEEDS HIS KIDNEY, NUMBER ONE.
NUMBER TWO, HE'S A FAT FUCK.

25:38.467 --> 25:41.067
- HE CAN'T EVEN
SURVIVE SURGERY.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

25:41.067 --> 25:43.167
YOU ARE HEALTHY AND THIN.
YOU'RE GIVING THE KIDNEY.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.300
END OF DISCUSSION,
MOOT POINT.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.500
( chatter on TV )

26:15.533 --> 26:18.200
OUT GOES Y-O-U.

26:18.233 --> 26:20.733
SO I'M OUT.
I'M THE WINNER.

26:20.767 --> 26:23.067
NO, THAT MEANS
YOU'RE OUT

26:23.067 --> 26:24.567
AND THE OTHER PEOPLE
STAY IN.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.833
THAT'S IF YOU'RE PLAYING
WITH MORE THAN TWO.

26:26.867 --> 26:29.867
IF YOU'RE PLAYING
WITH JUST TWO PEOPLE,

26:29.900 --> 26:31.667
THEN THE ONE WHO'S OUT
IS THE WINNER--

26:31.700 --> 26:35.067
OUT GOES Y-O-U.
I'M OUT, HE'S IN.

26:35.100 --> 26:38.133
- HE'S THE WINNER.
- HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED
EENY MEENY MINEY MOE?

26:38.167 --> 26:40.933
- YEAH, I HAVE.
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
- HAVE YOU?

26:40.967 --> 26:44.333
LISTEN, I GREW UP WITH
EENY MEENY MINEY MOE--
GREW UP WITH IT.

26:44.367 --> 26:47.200
- I DID TOO!
- I KNOW THE RULES
OF THE GAME.

26:49.300 --> 26:51.333
I THINK YOU'RE BEING
A BABY RIGHT NOW.

26:51.367 --> 26:53.300
YOU KNOW,IT'S TOTALLY UNFAIR.

26:53.333 --> 26:55.600
I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF
ALL THESE YEARS--

26:55.633 --> 26:58.267
THE DIET, THE EXERCISE,
THE WHOLE THING,

26:58.300 --> 27:00.433
FOR WHAT?

27:00.467 --> 27:03.567
I'D HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF
JUST EATING CRAP
AND SMOKING.

27:03.600 --> 27:07.467
THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN DOING ALL THESE YEARS--
EATING CRAP AND SMOKING.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.167
MAYBE THIS IS WHY
YOU WERE SAVED

27:09.200 --> 27:12.200
WHEN YOU WERE
DROWNING THAT DAY.

27:12.233 --> 27:14.733
MAYBE THIS IS...

27:14.767 --> 27:17.267
THE REASON.

27:17.300 --> 27:19.067
- OH REALLY?
- YEAH.

27:19.067 --> 27:21.167
OH, HE SAVED ME
SO I CAN GIVE UP A KIDNEY?

27:21.200 --> 27:22.367
THAT'S WHY?

27:22.400 --> 27:24.333
IF HE WANTS TO GET
SO INVOLVED,

27:24.367 --> 27:27.767
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST
FIX HIS KIDNEY TONIGHT
WHILE HE'S SLEEPING

27:27.800 --> 27:30.733
INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH
ALL THIS DROWNING-SAVING
BUSINESS?

27:32.867 --> 27:35.500
WELL, I THINK YOU'RE
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

27:35.533 --> 27:37.933
DON'T YOU FEEL GOOD
ABOUT DOING THIS
FOR RICHARD?

27:37.967 --> 27:39.633
- NO.
- YES YOU DO.

27:39.667 --> 27:42.267
I DON'T.
I FEEL AWFUL.

27:42.300 --> 27:45.867
- THINK ABOUT HOW
HE'S FEELING RIGHT NOW.
- HE FEELS GOOD.

27:45.900 --> 27:47.833
- WELL, DOESN'T THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD?
- NO.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.733
- WELL, YOU SHOULD.
- I DON'T.

27:49.767 --> 27:51.433
- YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
- I'M NOT.

27:51.467 --> 27:52.933
- YES YOU ARE.
- NO I'M NOT.

27:52.967 --> 27:55.167
I'M NOT GONNA LET
ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.367
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

27:58.067 --> 28:01.367
- AWW.
- THANK YOU.

28:01.400 --> 28:04.200
OKAY, YOU'RE WELCOME.
I'LL BE HERE.

28:04.233 --> 28:06.100
I'M NOT GONNA LET
ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU--

28:06.133 --> 28:09.533
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT?

28:09.567 --> 28:12.067
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE TURNING
CONSOLATION INTO SEX?

28:12.067 --> 28:15.333
WELL, THAT'S THE ULTIMATE
FORM OF CONSOLATION.

28:15.367 --> 28:17.800
- NO, IT'S NOT.
- YEAH, SURE IT IS.

28:17.833 --> 28:20.233
OKAY, JUST FORGET IT.

28:20.267 --> 28:23.900
YOU WERE CONSOLING ME
AND THAT'S-- THAT'S
CONSOLATION TO ME.

28:23.933 --> 28:27.067
SEX IS CONSOLATION.
ISN'T THAT CONSOLATION.
NO?

28:27.100 --> 28:29.067
Anchorman:
This has been
the third hold-up

28:29.100 --> 28:32.267
of a Jack in the Box
in the past two months.

28:32.300 --> 28:35.133
Police believe that
the suspect, Peter Hagen,
is responsible.

28:35.167 --> 28:37.967
HEY, THAT'S THAT GUY PETE--
THE GUY I GOT OUT OF JAIL.

28:38.067 --> 28:39.967
