00:32.533 --> 00:34.069
"Realm of the Samurai."

00:34.535 --> 00:38.495
That name for our land
is now just a memory.

00:39.831 --> 00:45.498
Twenty years ago, alien beings descended
to disrupt the peaceful world of Edo.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.917
We named them "Amanto" or "Sky People."

00:50.008 --> 00:52.295
They took over
and re-developed our entire city.

00:53.512 --> 00:56.346
The Bakufu government
became no more than their puppet.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.974
Initial attempts
were made to expel the invaders.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.686
A fearless band of patriots
fought the good fight.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.556
But after terrible sacrifice,
they were defeated.

01:07.651 --> 01:11.986
Fearing another rebellion,
the Amanto banned all swords...

01:12.864 --> 01:15.231
and the Samurai sank into irrelevance.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.745
Not like that, idiot!

01:28.213 --> 01:32.799
Even a chimpanzee could do this.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.461
Sorry. Swordsmanship is all I know.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.300
Fool!

01:40.767 --> 01:46.638
In Edo now, skill with a sword
is worse than useless.

01:47.024 --> 01:50.859
You Samurai are like shit on a shoe.

01:51.111 --> 01:55.651
Deprived of swords and status,
Samurai had lost their pride, too.

01:56.241 --> 02:00.201
Forget that, old man. Bring us milk.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.945
My pleasure, sir.

02:04.166 --> 02:07.125
Run milk to the good Sky People.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.163
Right.

02:16.261 --> 02:21.381
This one's no good as a waiter, either!

02:21.975 --> 02:24.968
I am so sorry!

02:25.145 --> 02:28.013
I've got milk on my lovely clothes.

02:28.482 --> 02:32.692
And you know how milk
makes everything stink.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.483
I'm sorry, sir.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.857
Don't use that dirty rag!

02:41.036 --> 02:43.369
Apologize this instant!

02:43.622 --> 02:49.289
Maybe it wasn't just the Samurai
whose patience was at an end.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.511
Who the hell are you?

03:06.770 --> 03:08.261
"Souvenir from Lake Toya"

03:08.563 --> 03:11.931
How dare you carry an illegal sword?

03:12.567 --> 03:15.605
Calm down, it's only made of wood.

03:16.947 --> 03:20.486
Quit whining like a tomcat in heat.

03:20.659 --> 03:21.775
Look at this...

03:21.993 --> 03:24.030
Your stupid screeching...

03:24.913 --> 03:27.075
has caused my chocolate parfait...

03:28.166 --> 03:30.499
to be ruined!

03:36.883 --> 03:40.092
Do you know who you're dealing with?

03:40.178 --> 03:41.510
My doctor informs me...

03:42.097 --> 03:44.805
that my blood sugar's too high.

03:45.350 --> 03:49.344
So I only get one parfait a week!

03:51.064 --> 03:54.774
He was too uncouth to be a Samurai...

03:54.943 --> 04:00.280
yet also too focused for
a common street hood.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.443
Boss man!

04:01.658 --> 04:03.650
- Sir?
- The parfait in question...

04:04.286 --> 04:05.993
It tastes great, however...

04:06.455 --> 04:09.744
the cornflake ratio makes
it overly crunchy.

04:10.292 --> 04:15.208
The latter half was crunch,
crunch all the way to the bottom.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.962
Up the ice-cream quotient!

04:17.632 --> 04:18.748
Four-eyes!

04:22.637 --> 04:23.798
Hang in there.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.765
This is Gintoki Sakata.

04:35.358 --> 04:39.819
As the "White Demon" he struck terror in
the Amanto during the wars of resistance.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.240
"GINTAMA - Lyrics, music & vocals - Shun
Oguri" "In this Amanto-infested city"

04:53.293 --> 04:54.454
"He roams the Edo streets alone"

04:54.461 --> 04:56.077
SHUN OGURI
"He roams the Edo streets alone"

04:58.673 --> 05:00.084
SHUN OGURI

05:00.175 --> 05:03.919
"Like a stray dog"

05:04.513 --> 05:05.924
"Tonight"

05:06.807 --> 05:13.054
"He bares his fangs to fight"

05:14.022 --> 05:16.435
Hey!

05:17.108 --> 05:21.022
Why is this cheesy video all about you?

05:21.071 --> 05:24.109
'Cause I'm the star. Isn't it cool?

05:24.199 --> 05:25.940
It's such crappy quality.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.117
Worse than a bad karaoke video.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.616
I made it at home on my laptop.

05:30.664 --> 05:34.749
Keep your homemade crap off the big screen.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.293
How many times does your name show?

05:37.379 --> 05:39.291
But I'm the lead role.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.296
Couldn't even read the last few.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.712
They're in Arabic and Korean.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.592
Like we care.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.971
You even sang the title song, right?
It's really bad.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.215
How dare you say that?

05:50.267 --> 05:52.930
That cafÃ© scene's unnecessary, too.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.516
Some viewers won't know the original manga.

05:55.564 --> 05:59.979
Die-hard fans
are sure to write harsh reviews...

06:00.026 --> 06:03.394
so we need the new viewers
to be kind to us.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.857
You're absolutely right.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.319
Let's introduce ourselves.

06:07.409 --> 06:11.779
After the scene at the cafÃ©,
I went to work for "Odd Jobs" Gin-san.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.662
My name's Shinpachi Shimura.

06:13.748 --> 06:17.992
My family had a fencing school,
but we ran out of pupils.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.998
- He's in deep shit.
- No need to say that.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.208
I'm Kagura, the story's heroine.

06:22.257 --> 06:25.216
- Lovely Kagura.
- Don't sweet-talk me.

06:25.260 --> 06:31.473
She's an alien from the Yato-clan,
renowned for their martial arts.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.757
I'm also cute as well.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.472
It's a long story, but she works with us.

06:35.520 --> 06:39.730
I'm a rare beauty. Check
out this amazing pic.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.983
That's the famous one!

06:43.278 --> 06:46.817
- Lovely Kagura.
- Don't start that again.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.699
Now for the one-time-only
Gintama live-action adaptation.

06:49.784 --> 06:55.496
Don't leave early
or you'll be on Warner Bros' blacklist.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.701
Don't say that.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.533
Okay...

06:58.627 --> 07:01.495
Countdown...

07:01.546 --> 07:04.129
TBS will be mad we stole their format

07:20.106 --> 07:23.520
"Gin-Chan Odd-Jobs-R-Us"
Beetle hunting!

07:23.526 --> 07:25.142
"Sugar"

07:25.153 --> 07:26.769
"Strawberry milk"

07:27.280 --> 07:32.526
I want to go beetle hunting!

07:32.619 --> 07:35.657
Beetle hunting,
the time-honored childhood pursuit.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.122
I need a new Rhino beetle!

07:38.124 --> 07:42.915
I lost a beetle-wrestling match
and forfeited McCartney #28.

07:46.925 --> 07:51.215
That's why I propose
we go beetle-hunting, okay?

07:51.221 --> 07:53.008
Just go by yourself, then.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.880
Four-eyed jerk!

07:54.891 --> 07:57.634
Mind my glasses!

07:57.644 --> 07:59.101
Just chill, okay?

07:59.104 --> 08:03.895
I'll find a monster Rhino beetle
and get my revenge.

08:03.900 --> 08:08.611
By the way, McCartney #28
was a dung beetle, not a Rhino.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.070
Shut your mouth!

08:10.073 --> 08:12.781
Not again!

08:13.410 --> 08:16.903
Let's hear how this guy found
his amazing beetle.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.742
Listen, Kagura...

08:22.877 --> 08:25.790
We're grownups now.

08:26.339 --> 08:31.175
We don't get a thrill
from bug collecting anymore.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.544
Get the thrill back.

08:33.554 --> 08:38.549
The young-at-heart
are always popular with girls.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.431
I'm fine not being popular, thanks.

08:41.438 --> 08:45.022
I found this beetle in the forest.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.143
It's worth as much as a car.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.816
This little beetle?

08:51.072 --> 08:54.065
Come on, guys...

08:54.075 --> 08:55.611
Help me!

08:55.618 --> 09:00.613
I was lucky to find it so close.

09:01.124 --> 09:04.162
Like a diamond in the forest.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.037
Rhino beetle... Rhino beetle...

09:08.465 --> 09:11.333
Kagura, just let it go...

09:11.426 --> 09:14.169
Beetle-hunting we shall go!

09:20.602 --> 09:21.683
Okay, gang.

09:22.103 --> 09:26.313
We hunt, hunt, hunt,
then make cash, cash, cash!

09:26.357 --> 09:29.691
I just want to replace McCartney #28.

09:29.736 --> 09:30.897
Guys...

09:31.613 --> 09:34.697
No going home till we catch a huge one.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.945
This is business. Business,
pure and simple.

09:36.993 --> 09:40.987
Greed always brings out his pompous side.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.746
Let's just find a beetle, right?

09:43.041 --> 09:44.248
I get it.

09:44.834 --> 09:49.374
But the forest can host great evil.
There's no telling what lies in wait.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.830
Be on your guard.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.675
This is harder than I thought.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.967
Is there an easy way to find them?

10:02.018 --> 10:05.728
If you stand coated in honey, they swarm.

10:05.814 --> 10:09.649
Only a crazy pervert would do that.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.230
"Commander of Shinsengumi - Isao Kondo"

10:17.075 --> 10:21.615
"Chief of Edo Police -
Stalker of Shinpachi's sister"

10:21.913 --> 10:24.326
"Nickname: Gorilla"

10:25.208 --> 10:26.324
What's that?

10:30.755 --> 10:33.168
What are you doing, Gorilla-san?

10:34.259 --> 10:38.219
Being a tree, obviously.
And you don't talk to trees.

10:38.263 --> 10:41.427
We're talking to you
'cause it's not obvious.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.137
I think you overdid the honey.

10:44.185 --> 10:48.771
Is this appropriate behavior
from a Chief of Police?

10:48.857 --> 10:51.224
- Trees don't talk.
- Kondo-san, you're beautiful.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.893
It's too disturbing.
Let's pretend we never saw it.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.033
Really beautiful, Kondo-san.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.653
That was an unexpected sight...

11:04.706 --> 11:08.074
Let's pretend it was an
illusory forest spirit.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.333
But it was Gorilla.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.120
A gorilla spirit protecting the gorillas.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.583
What gorillas?

11:16.759 --> 11:19.217
"Shinsengumi Deputy Chief
- Toshiro Hijikata"

11:19.679 --> 11:20.920
"a. k. a. Mayo Lover"

11:22.974 --> 11:24.761
Do beetles like mayonnaise?

11:24.976 --> 11:28.435
Why force his preference
on the poor beetles?

11:28.479 --> 11:31.768
- I bet he licks it himself.
- Disgusting.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.398
Let us ignore it.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.436
My eyes are getting tired.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.236
There's something weird about this place.

11:41.284 --> 11:44.618
- That guy's a nicotine addict.
- Nicochin's the name of a goblin.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.870
It's rumored to have two penises.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.123
Bingo!

11:55.840 --> 11:57.456
It's so huge!

12:06.893 --> 12:08.179
Kagura, go for it.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.014
Leave this to me.

12:15.944 --> 12:19.028
I'll rule the world of beetle-wrestling.

12:19.155 --> 12:23.274
No, let's sell it and buy a house.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.658
Kindly refrain, my good man.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.038
Okita-san!

12:30.541 --> 12:33.329
"Shinsengumi Captain - Sougo Okita"

12:33.878 --> 12:35.119
"Super sadist"

12:35.546 --> 12:37.788
- What are you doing?
- Isn't it obvious?

12:37.840 --> 12:40.503
It's obvious that you're an idiot.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.720
Help me up, I can't do it myself.

12:44.806 --> 12:45.887
Pathetic.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.388
Heck...

12:48.059 --> 12:51.678
My stealthy approach strategy is ruined.

12:51.688 --> 12:55.056
Hey, what are you all doing here?

12:55.149 --> 12:56.515
I'd ask you the same.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.859
One shady move and I'll arrest you.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.522
You look way, way shadier.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.239
Why are you all here?

13:04.325 --> 13:05.987
We owe you no explanation.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.492
We're catching beetles.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.202
Beyond that hint...

13:09.706 --> 13:11.322
we'll say nothing more.

13:11.374 --> 13:14.492
The Shogun's pet beetle has escaped.

13:14.711 --> 13:15.622
He's saying more.

13:15.712 --> 13:16.998
But not one word further.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.750
Rurimaru shines like gold.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.878
Kondo-san! Enough.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.545
Edo's finest...

13:26.597 --> 13:31.683
wasting taxpayers' money,
bug-hunting of an afternoon.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.222
That was him, right?

13:38.568 --> 13:41.106
Suppose we catch that beetle...

13:41.612 --> 13:43.774
imagine the huge reward!

13:43.906 --> 13:46.148
What a wicked thought...

13:46.284 --> 13:47.365
Get it!

13:47.410 --> 13:49.618
Never!

14:03.301 --> 14:07.716
We'll be in disgrace
if commoners catch the royal beetle.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.930
Don't let it get away!

14:15.063 --> 14:16.804
"Tae Shimura, Shinpachi's older sister"

14:17.357 --> 14:19.474
"Co-owner of the fencing school"

14:19.525 --> 14:21.266
"One tough cookie"

14:21.277 --> 14:24.816
- Tae, my darling!
- Kondo-san, wrong way.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.614
What are you doing?

14:27.658 --> 14:29.991
My honey-gold ass hairs...

14:30.119 --> 14:32.452
they're a sight to behold!

14:36.876 --> 14:38.117
Don't get any ideas.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.586
Idiot!

14:40.588 --> 14:43.797
Tae, darling!

14:46.135 --> 14:49.128
"Kotaro Katsura:"
Elizabeth, a true Samurai

14:49.138 --> 14:51.255
"Former resistance fighter"
never lets money affect him.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.506
"Still active underground"

14:52.517 --> 14:55.225
Always try to eat a simple meal...

14:56.687 --> 14:58.974
"Elizabeth: Katsura's pet from outer space"

15:00.358 --> 15:02.566
Zura! Get out of the way!

15:02.610 --> 15:04.476
It's not Zura, I'm Katsura!

15:05.279 --> 15:07.271
Gintoki, you're being pursued?

15:08.783 --> 15:10.445
Let me lend my support.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.175
To hell with you!

15:40.857 --> 15:41.973
Katsura!

15:46.487 --> 15:49.355
Relax, I used the blunt edge.

15:51.367 --> 15:55.077
Well, fancy meeting you here...

15:55.246 --> 15:57.704
The rebel Katsura...

15:57.707 --> 15:59.414
Elizabeth, let's run.

16:00.042 --> 16:03.706
I mustn't always let you escape.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.677
Wait there!

16:12.930 --> 16:15.798
Scum like you
will never touch the royal beetle.

16:15.933 --> 16:19.552
Gintoki runs real fast
when he's blinded by greed.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.061
As fast as Char from Gundam?

16:21.063 --> 16:22.599
Never.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.898
Come to Papa!

16:47.089 --> 16:48.500
Is this a joke?

17:00.561 --> 17:05.807
Why do the cops always suspect me?
They're so stupid.

17:05.900 --> 17:10.019
And how tacky
that the Shogun had a pet beetle...

17:10.154 --> 17:14.272
Well, you've got Q-Taro
and that's bad enough.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.695
It's not Q-Taro, it's Elizabeth.

17:17.078 --> 17:21.117
Anyway, it's not a serious matter.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.916
Pardon me for causing you concern.

17:24.919 --> 17:29.505
It becomes my business
if you fight Shinsengumi in broad daylight.

17:29.632 --> 17:33.672
It's not like we did
anything to provoke them.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.929
Beetles, of all things...

17:39.600 --> 17:42.889
We went bug-hunting as kids, huh?

17:47.692 --> 17:51.777
"Shokasonjuku School"

17:51.904 --> 17:58.071
You'll encounter many hardships in life...

17:59.453 --> 18:04.289
it's up to you how you deal with them.

18:05.459 --> 18:06.575
One thing...

18:06.711 --> 18:10.580
I want you all to remember.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.626
"Bushido for Beginners"

18:18.097 --> 18:22.216
Ever wish you
could go back to those days, Gintoki?

18:22.518 --> 18:24.680
Not at all.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.012
Shoyo Yoshida.

18:27.064 --> 18:32.150
For inciting resistance
against the Bakufu/Amanto regime...

18:32.194 --> 18:35.858
we arrest you as a traitor.

18:42.580 --> 18:43.912
You're right...

18:44.373 --> 18:48.617
We'd have to deal with the pain
of losing him again.

18:50.254 --> 18:54.123
Blame it on the Bakufu
or blame history itself.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.551
Gintoki, Katsura, take the flank.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.928
- Takasugi, will you be okay alone?
- Trust me.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.516
Don't die!

19:05.728 --> 19:08.186
We've got a reason to survive.

19:21.452 --> 19:24.286
You're the White Demon.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.539
What motivates you to fight?

19:29.085 --> 19:31.793
Why throw your lives away?

19:34.340 --> 19:36.127
Isn't it obvious?

19:37.593 --> 19:40.210
To avenge our teacher's death.

19:41.430 --> 19:45.174
I need you to stop stirring up trouble.

19:45.601 --> 19:49.561
It's not fair on Shinpachi and Kagura.

19:49.605 --> 19:54.441
It was Kagura who wanted a beetle.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.728
And you pick your nose too much.

19:58.989 --> 20:02.528
But the boogers keep coming.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.153
Don't flick it!

20:06.330 --> 20:08.367
Or wipe it, either.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.041
Whatever...

20:12.753 --> 20:15.496
I've got some advice for you.

20:15.923 --> 20:19.257
There's a serial killer on the loose.
Be careful.

20:19.510 --> 20:24.096
You look like a chick from behind, Zura.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.177
It's not Zura, it's Katsura.

20:26.267 --> 20:30.136
I hardly need to worry
about being attacked.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.016
If you say so.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.359
See you around.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.667
Excuse me.

20:59.216 --> 21:02.004
Might you be Kotaro Katsura?

21:03.053 --> 21:04.885
You've got the wrong person.

21:05.681 --> 21:10.551
Don't worry.
I'm not some cursed government dog.

21:12.313 --> 21:17.183
Maybe a dog thirsting for blood, though?

21:18.235 --> 21:24.072
I heard there's a mad-dog killer
on the loose...

21:24.742 --> 21:27.359
Be careful who you bite, my friend.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.529
Unfortunately...

21:31.081 --> 21:35.701
my buddy and I fancy the
blood of a tough guy.

21:36.837 --> 21:37.953
How about it?

21:40.049 --> 21:42.382
Indulge us in a duel?

21:43.844 --> 21:46.427
That sword...

21:52.937 --> 21:56.226
Oh, dear, is that it?

22:00.110 --> 22:04.229
The serial killer is in the news again.

22:04.281 --> 22:08.901
He struck last night in Edo.
Miss Sole has the story.

22:08.911 --> 22:10.527
Miss Sole are you there?

22:10.704 --> 22:12.411
This is Sole, reporting live.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.743
State your initial, too.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.954
I'm R. Sole reporting live.

22:17.044 --> 22:20.537
The incident occurred
around midnight last night.

22:20.589 --> 22:26.301
Injury patterns suggest
it's the same killer as in previous cases.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.804
Hey, R. Sole, who is the victim?

22:30.099 --> 22:32.091
At this moment...

22:32.142 --> 22:34.759
- State your name each time.
- Sure, I'm R. Sole.

22:34.895 --> 22:39.265
We've no information
about the victim's identity.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.896
How many does that make it?

22:41.944 --> 22:45.437
They say he mostly kills ronin.

22:45.614 --> 22:49.824
It's getting scary to go out at night.

23:00.629 --> 23:04.168
What's up, Q-Taro? You're awfully quiet.

23:04.258 --> 23:06.841
Gin-chan. It's Elizabeth.

23:07.845 --> 23:12.510
It's not weird
when he's a manga or anime character.

23:12.933 --> 23:16.222
But in real life, I just
sense a guy in a suit.

23:16.645 --> 23:20.639
There's no way
around the guy-in-the-suit feeling.

23:20.941 --> 23:24.184
In real life, he just looks scary, I think.

23:24.278 --> 23:25.860
Here's some coffee.

23:35.205 --> 23:38.323
No reaction. What now?

23:38.375 --> 23:41.368
Did the guy inside faint from the heat?

23:41.462 --> 23:43.203
Not supposed to mention him.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.497
He's a dead-ringer for Q-Taro.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.045
Is he going to eat 50 bowls of rice?

23:48.719 --> 23:50.381
Is he totally scared of dogs?

23:51.513 --> 23:56.224
Or are we in the live adaptation
of a Q-Taro movie?

23:56.310 --> 23:58.802
Yikes, that'd be better than ours.

23:58.854 --> 24:02.564
Doronpa must be here somewhere!
Come on out, Doronpa!

24:02.650 --> 24:04.516
Please calm down!

24:05.569 --> 24:08.027
I'm sure he's the real Elizabeth.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.988
But he hasn't said a word.

24:11.659 --> 24:14.572
Obviously he's up to something.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.915
Hello, Gin-chan of Odd Jobs-R-Us...

24:24.004 --> 24:27.372
Shinpachi, it's our last resort. Go get it.

24:27.424 --> 24:30.087
It's Gintoki's private supply.
He'll be mad.

24:30.511 --> 24:34.255
Don't worry. He's not a kid anymore.

24:34.431 --> 24:37.265
He's got to stop drinking it,
or he'll be diabetic.

24:37.309 --> 24:41.428
Okay, since we're
responsible for his health.

24:41.522 --> 24:44.185
I'll be right over.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.729
I'm off now.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.229
Uh, you're bleeding.

24:50.364 --> 24:51.730
Where are you going?

24:51.949 --> 24:55.442
Time to get to work.

24:55.536 --> 24:58.244
Liar! You're just trying to escape.

24:58.288 --> 25:00.075
I'll leave him in your hands.

25:04.878 --> 25:07.086
Shinpachi, now's our chance.

25:17.141 --> 25:18.928
Here's some strawberry milk.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.096
"Gintoki's"

25:23.731 --> 25:25.973
Listen, Elizabeth...

25:26.483 --> 25:30.193
A Samurai eats plain and wholesome food.

25:30.946 --> 25:36.908
Strawberry milk, parfaits,
sugary snacks and frivolous things...

25:37.077 --> 25:40.821
weaken both body and soul.

25:44.168 --> 25:47.332
He's crying!

25:47.421 --> 25:49.504
Good job, Shinpachi.

25:50.174 --> 25:53.963
But why did strawberry milk make him cry?

25:54.219 --> 25:57.508
"Swordsmiths"

26:03.437 --> 26:06.145
Hello, I'm from Odd Jobs-R-Us.

26:09.151 --> 26:12.189
Hello, I'm from Odd Jobs-R-Us.

26:14.948 --> 26:18.567
Excuse me? I'm Gintoki from Odd Jobs!

26:21.872 --> 26:25.616
Excuse me? I'm Gintoki from Odd Jobs!

26:25.667 --> 26:27.499
What did you say?

26:27.795 --> 26:33.041
I'm from Odd Jobs. It seems you called.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.876
If you're from that cooking show, piss off.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.837
I'm not Yonesuke!

26:39.098 --> 26:41.306
I'm also not involved in a sex scandal.

26:41.350 --> 26:44.218
I'm not from a gossip magazine, either.

26:44.269 --> 26:49.185
Can't you hear me?
You goddamn loudmouthed jerk!

26:53.070 --> 26:56.859
I'm terribly sorry about that.

26:57.533 --> 27:01.368
I get so sweaty from work
my hand must've slipped.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.902
I apologize.

27:04.665 --> 27:06.031
Don't mention it.

27:06.750 --> 27:12.041
By the way, we are siblings.
We forge swords.

27:12.256 --> 27:16.091
My name is Tetsuya Murata.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.342
And this is...

27:21.515 --> 27:23.723
Say hello to the gentleman, Tetsuko.

27:24.184 --> 27:28.975
If you don't say your name,
he won't know what to call you.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.809
Tetsuko!

27:30.816 --> 27:35.857
You already said it quite loud,
so I know it's Tetsuko.

27:36.029 --> 27:37.611
My apologies, Sakata-san.

27:37.948 --> 27:40.986
She's a shy oaf of creature.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.195
No problem.

27:42.369 --> 27:46.909
It's tough for swordsmiths
now swords are banned.

27:46.957 --> 27:50.075
Anyway, the task I have for you...

27:50.127 --> 27:52.335
Are you ignoring me on purpose?

27:52.421 --> 27:56.210
My forefather's...
Well, my father's masterwork,

27:56.258 --> 27:59.842
Benizakura, has been stolen.

28:02.639 --> 28:06.508
What is this Benizakura of which you speak?

28:06.518 --> 28:08.635
I want you to find it for me.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.054
Still not listening, I gather.

28:11.273 --> 28:12.764
Benizakura...

28:12.941 --> 28:17.652
was forged by my late father,
the finest swordsmith in Edo.

28:17.738 --> 28:20.776
It is thought to be his best work.

28:20.824 --> 28:23.612
Its blade can cleave boulders...

28:23.744 --> 28:27.488
and by moonlight, it gleams a pale crimson.

28:28.332 --> 28:32.827
As mysterious and beautiful
as sakura at night.

28:32.920 --> 28:36.630
It is a splendid blade without equal.

28:36.715 --> 28:40.925
An amazing story. Any idea who stole it?

28:40.928 --> 28:44.092
But Benizakura is not a
thing for human hands.

28:44.097 --> 28:46.464
Sir, learn to listen to other people.

28:46.475 --> 28:48.011
This much I know.

28:48.352 --> 28:52.722
My father died suddenly,
soon after completing the sword.

28:53.690 --> 28:59.152
Misfortune befalls
whoever gets his hands upon it.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.646
That sword...

29:03.700 --> 29:07.865
is a demonic thing that
possesses mens' souls.

29:07.913 --> 29:10.280
Wait one goddamn moment!

29:10.332 --> 29:14.372
So it could land me in trouble, too?

29:14.461 --> 29:16.999
Please find it before
further tragedy strikes.

29:17.047 --> 29:19.881
Listen to me, please!

29:20.842 --> 29:25.507
Speak close into his ear
and really project your voice.

29:25.555 --> 29:28.138
Is that right?

29:28.392 --> 29:30.509
Why not tell me before?

29:35.565 --> 29:39.400
Sir!

29:39.736 --> 29:41.193
Lift up your chin.

29:41.321 --> 29:44.405
Sir!

29:44.700 --> 29:46.191
Like Inoki, the wrestler.

29:46.368 --> 29:48.530
Sir! How's it going?

29:48.578 --> 29:50.035
Shut up!

29:50.455 --> 29:52.412
I'll get him for this!

29:59.548 --> 30:03.542
Are you sure it's Katsura's blood?

30:04.928 --> 30:06.214
From this morning?

30:08.265 --> 30:09.381
That means...

30:09.766 --> 30:11.257
"Maybe the body was..."

30:11.268 --> 30:15.353
Elizabeth, you know better than anyone.

30:15.897 --> 30:19.231
He wouldn't lose to your
average serial killer.

30:19.276 --> 30:24.146
But it's obvious something bad happened.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.653
If we don't find him, who
knows how it'll end?

30:32.456 --> 30:33.742
"It might even be too late"

30:34.082 --> 30:36.074
Don't be stupid!

30:45.052 --> 30:48.636
If you've no faith in Katsura-san,
then who has?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.512
What can you do for him?

30:50.724 --> 30:53.808
How can you help?!

30:53.852 --> 30:55.593
Say something!

30:55.771 --> 30:57.558
That hurts.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.982
Let me go, or I'll tear you to shreds.

31:02.778 --> 31:05.316
I'm sorry.

31:06.448 --> 31:10.818
I'll go search for Katsura with Sadaharu.

31:11.453 --> 31:14.491
You look for the killer with Ellie.

31:37.062 --> 31:38.473
"Thrift Store & Pawn Shop"

31:42.567 --> 31:46.561
I thought the thief
would try to sell it quickly.

31:46.613 --> 31:51.074
But maybe it's not money he's after...

31:51.576 --> 31:53.568
Which means...

31:55.080 --> 31:56.662
Looking for something?

31:57.499 --> 31:59.957
I'm working right now.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.793
It's not a police matter. Let me be.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.830
The beetle's gone, the
Shogun's heartbroken...

32:05.841 --> 32:07.924
and we're in the doghouse.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.884
It's none of my business.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.423
But all's fine and dandy with you.

32:14.850 --> 32:20.266
Let me warn you, though.
There's a killer on the loose.

32:21.398 --> 32:24.436
He kills everyone in his path.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.480
However, a single witness...

32:27.070 --> 32:29.107
said the sword he carries...

32:30.031 --> 32:33.775
is more like a living thing than a weapon.

32:35.036 --> 32:38.780
Gleaming crimson in the moonlight.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.251
I see.

32:44.546 --> 32:45.627
Sir.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.462
What lead are you following?

32:55.432 --> 32:56.297
Nothing.

32:56.308 --> 32:59.142
Liar! That's obviously your lying face.

33:21.208 --> 33:24.451
"Defeat the Serial Killer!"

33:27.964 --> 33:31.753
Elizabeth! I bought some pork buns.

33:32.052 --> 33:34.214
"I only eat pork buns from 551 Horai"

33:34.930 --> 33:38.970
Please stop with the Osaka in-jokes.

33:38.975 --> 33:42.184
The convenience store
only had the cheap ones.

33:43.980 --> 33:48.395
So, did the killer show?

33:50.070 --> 33:52.187
Isn't it a little reckless?

33:52.280 --> 33:56.365
To ask the killer himself
about Katsura-san?

33:57.244 --> 34:00.032
We're not even sure he's the culprit.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.031
"Stay quiet & hide behind me"

34:06.670 --> 34:08.706
"Those behind me will die"

34:08.713 --> 34:10.920
That's totally contradictory!

34:11.341 --> 34:15.130
In the dark, I can't tell
your front from back.

34:15.762 --> 34:18.219
Okay, I'll get in front.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.268
Hey.

34:25.981 --> 34:29.895
What the devil's going on?
You look suspicious.

34:30.902 --> 34:34.485
It's just the local magistrate.
I thought it was serious.

34:34.531 --> 34:35.737
What a relief.

34:35.782 --> 34:40.368
That's rude. I'm supposed
to be intimidating.

34:40.870 --> 34:44.909
I'll have you know, recently...

34:53.675 --> 34:56.918
there's a killer on the loose.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.302
Elizabeth!

35:06.479 --> 35:08.766
Now, it's the young man's turn.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.609
A serial killer...

35:16.406 --> 35:17.772
isn't choosy.

35:22.996 --> 35:26.956
What are you doing to my guest?

35:43.725 --> 35:46.263
You're Nizo the Butcher?

35:53.443 --> 35:55.059
Well, well...

35:55.862 --> 35:59.651
Seems that I'm becoming famous.

35:59.949 --> 36:02.157
It would appear so.

36:02.952 --> 36:07.322
Your face is on posters all over town.

36:07.624 --> 36:11.664
The killings are your handiwork.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.294
But why are you here, Gin-san?

36:14.756 --> 36:19.000
Our objectives converged, apparently.

36:19.427 --> 36:20.543
What?

36:21.971 --> 36:27.342
How nice of you to come see me.

36:29.187 --> 36:34.524
This sword is supposedly cursed
to bring only misfortune.

36:36.152 --> 36:40.487
But tough guys flock to it, apparently.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.861
You above all.

36:43.326 --> 36:50.165
It lured you here just as I wished,
so maybe the sword's on my side.

36:50.542 --> 36:53.205
What did you do with Katsura-san?

36:53.253 --> 36:56.712
Oh, dear. Was he an acquaintance?

36:57.132 --> 36:59.169
I was rather naughty.

36:59.342 --> 37:02.926
Playing with my new sword,
I got carried away.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.429
He was dead before I knew it.

37:05.557 --> 37:09.551
Zura wouldn't lose out to
a cheap thug like you.

37:09.644 --> 37:14.105
Don't get angry. I said I'm sorry.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.185
Which reminds me...

37:18.611 --> 37:19.897
Here.

37:21.281 --> 37:24.240
You get a memento, at least.

37:24.784 --> 37:29.575
I took it off him as a trophy.

37:29.914 --> 37:33.248
But he'd prefer you to have it.

37:33.668 --> 37:37.082
Was he really male?

37:38.423 --> 37:41.507
His hair is so silky smooth.

37:42.218 --> 37:43.675
Just like a woman's.

37:51.144 --> 37:54.262
Don't make me repeat myself.

37:55.106 --> 37:59.646
Zura wouldn't let a punk like you
get the better of him.

38:01.362 --> 38:05.356
Indeed. I'm no match for him.

38:07.827 --> 38:10.444
It wasn't me who cut him down.

38:11.206 --> 38:14.290
I let myself be possessed for a moment.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.868
Right, Benizakura?

38:20.673 --> 38:24.633
Sadaharu, it's gotten dark.

38:25.512 --> 38:28.630
We should get back or the
guys will be worried.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.298
Or will they?

38:32.352 --> 38:33.638
Maybe not.

38:44.864 --> 38:47.072
Zura should be fine.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.988
He's tough. It'd take a lot to kill him.

38:50.119 --> 38:52.862
Let's call it a day and restart tomorrow.

38:54.624 --> 38:55.910
Sadaharu?

38:59.128 --> 39:02.838
Have you picked up Zura's scent?

39:05.426 --> 39:07.338
What's that ship?

39:07.929 --> 39:09.716
It's huge.

39:09.722 --> 39:11.714
Hey, did you find him?

39:14.060 --> 39:18.100
Nope. Okada-san's gone rogue again.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.938
He's really dangerous.

39:19.983 --> 39:24.853
He bragged that he'd killed Katsura.
I wouldn't put it past him.

39:24.863 --> 39:28.607
What do we do?
You should've kept your eye on him.

39:28.908 --> 39:32.572
We'll be in trouble
if people find out about it.

39:43.423 --> 39:48.168
Sadaharu,
go back to the store and get Gin-chan.

39:49.053 --> 39:52.637
No detours, even for cute girl-dogs.

39:53.766 --> 39:56.509
No climbing on top and humping.

39:59.188 --> 40:01.145
Right, I'm going in...

40:03.693 --> 40:04.900
To the right.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.729
"Ramen"

40:09.782 --> 40:12.991
I can't help but follow my instincts...

40:13.536 --> 40:16.153
and nobody works on an empty stomach.

40:20.376 --> 40:23.164
Baldy, three orders of ramen.

40:23.296 --> 40:24.628
I'm not bald.

41:27.443 --> 41:29.309
That's odd.

41:30.238 --> 41:34.323
Are you really the White Demon of legend?

41:36.411 --> 41:38.778
That's odd.

41:39.288 --> 41:43.999
Is that thing really a sword?

41:46.087 --> 41:51.708
They say it's more like a living being.

41:52.260 --> 41:56.550
But if you ask me it's more like...

41:57.724 --> 41:59.010
a monster itself.

42:19.787 --> 42:23.371
Fights aren't only decided with weapons.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.050
This isn't a fight.

42:35.762 --> 42:37.298
It's a duel to the death.

42:38.181 --> 42:40.423
Gin-san!

42:45.813 --> 42:49.978
Uh-oh. This ain't good.

43:01.621 --> 43:02.737
No way...

43:03.790 --> 43:05.122
This can't be happening.

43:05.458 --> 43:06.824
Gin-san is...

43:09.462 --> 43:12.125
Peaceful Edo dulled your Samurai skills?

43:13.132 --> 43:18.844
White Demon, Katsura... Where did
those legends of the resistance go?

43:21.474 --> 43:25.684
He must be disappointed.

43:26.687 --> 43:33.059
Each and every comrade
ending up the same way.

43:34.570 --> 43:39.565
Our nation turned corrupt
because of weak Samurai like you.

43:40.618 --> 43:47.661
It wouldn't be in this poor state
if I'd been by his side.

43:52.755 --> 43:55.042
Bushido, moral codes...

43:55.591 --> 43:58.504
Samurai shouldn't dwell on these details.

43:59.178 --> 44:02.762
The only thing they need are swords.

44:03.766 --> 44:06.600
With your broken sword,
you're no longer a Samurai.

44:07.979 --> 44:11.188
Our country has no place for weak Samurai.

44:14.026 --> 44:16.484
Is my sword broken?

44:22.702 --> 44:24.944
I still have a sword.

44:27.290 --> 44:30.454
My best one, actually.

44:46.809 --> 44:50.723
Oh, my. It seems you took off my arm.

44:52.356 --> 44:54.939
How mean of you.

44:55.067 --> 44:58.777
One move and I'll make it a pair.

45:06.495 --> 45:10.910
I'm Okita from Shinsengumi.
You must be Nizo Okada.

45:14.462 --> 45:16.875
He's come to spoil our fun.

45:18.090 --> 45:20.298
We'll settle this later.

45:24.013 --> 45:25.094
Get him!

45:29.518 --> 45:30.634
Gin-san.

45:30.895 --> 45:32.978
You were on his trail after all.

45:33.064 --> 45:35.556
Hang in there, Gin-san!

45:36.025 --> 45:38.108
If only I'd got here earlier...

45:38.819 --> 45:40.481
Shinpachi...

45:44.408 --> 45:47.901
I knew you had it in you.

45:54.168 --> 45:56.501
- Let's get him out of here.
- Yes.

45:56.671 --> 45:59.630
"Shinsengumi Police H. Q."

46:27.827 --> 46:29.944
It seems the rumor was true.

46:29.996 --> 46:31.282
What rumor?

46:32.790 --> 46:36.124
Takasugi is back in Edo.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.035
What?

46:38.671 --> 46:42.381
The toughest
and most radical resistance fighter...

46:43.009 --> 46:44.875
Shinsuke Takasugi.

46:45.386 --> 46:48.299
Apparently he's teamed up with Nizo
the serial killer.

46:48.514 --> 46:50.380
Nizo the Butcher?

46:51.309 --> 46:54.552
I just watched him fight Gintoki.

46:55.021 --> 46:58.731
It was Nizo the Butcher for sure.

46:59.400 --> 47:01.141
He's not the only problem.

47:01.944 --> 47:06.359
The gunslinger Matako Kijima's back, too.

47:06.741 --> 47:10.826
And that pervert strategist,
Henpeita Takechi.

47:11.495 --> 47:16.081
Takasugi has resurrected the Kiheitai.

47:17.918 --> 47:19.409
The Kiheitai?

47:20.713 --> 47:24.127
His band of mercenaries
from the wars of resistance?

47:27.053 --> 47:30.592
It's said they fought like demons.

47:31.223 --> 47:35.217
Why on Earth does he want them to reform?

47:35.311 --> 47:40.431
A strong paramilitary could help him
launch a coup d'etat.

47:41.817 --> 47:43.058
Kondo-san...

47:44.487 --> 47:46.399
He's dangerous.

47:46.906 --> 47:50.866
Facing Nizo alone would be bad enough.

47:51.369 --> 47:55.830
Even Gintoki was no match for him.

47:57.583 --> 48:01.452
Score-settling with ex-resistance guys
isn't a big deal.

48:01.712 --> 48:04.295
But a coup d'etat is another story.

48:04.757 --> 48:09.343
Toshi, get all the information you can.

48:09.929 --> 48:11.090
Got it.

48:12.473 --> 48:14.055
Also, Kondo-san...

48:14.975 --> 48:17.638
you don't have to be naked
for fencing drills.

48:24.235 --> 48:25.897
Hey, you...

48:28.489 --> 48:33.325
You work on this boat?
Could you show me around?

48:33.911 --> 48:36.403
Unless you want to lose your head.

48:40.251 --> 48:42.334
Are you listening?

48:44.797 --> 48:49.258
The moon's large tonight.

48:50.970 --> 48:53.963
Almost bright enough
for Princess Kaguya to appear.

48:55.057 --> 48:57.765
But here's Princess Tomboy instead.

49:01.355 --> 49:05.599
Heck, I sense something fishy.

49:53.866 --> 49:56.074
Who the hell are you?

49:56.160 --> 49:58.743
How dare you threaten Lord Shinsuke?

49:59.163 --> 50:03.828
Drop it. Nobody draws faster than me,
Matako Kijima.

50:03.834 --> 50:06.872
Matako, your underwear's showing.

50:07.213 --> 50:10.126
They're kind of stained.

50:10.132 --> 50:15.127
Don't think I'll fall for that old trick.
Besides, I change them daily.

50:15.346 --> 50:20.057
There's some kind of mark on 'em.

50:20.267 --> 50:22.600
It's gross.

50:22.603 --> 50:27.018
"Matako's got panty stains.

50:27.107 --> 50:30.896
"It's no wonder she can't shoot straight."

50:31.487 --> 50:36.482
How dare you insult me in front of him?

50:36.492 --> 50:40.281
My Liege, don't believe
a word this brat says.

50:40.996 --> 50:44.580
Look for yourself.

50:44.583 --> 50:47.121
They're filthy.

50:47.461 --> 50:48.577
You bitch!

50:48.754 --> 50:52.122
Don't pick your nose
while you're down there.

50:52.216 --> 50:54.629
I could've sworn I changed them.

50:58.222 --> 51:00.259
You brat!

51:00.266 --> 51:01.632
Takechi, sir!

51:06.313 --> 51:09.522
No one is to shoot.

51:10.234 --> 51:15.025
To kill women and children
is unworthy of a Samurai.

51:15.364 --> 51:18.232
Take her alive.

51:18.242 --> 51:19.449
Sir!

51:19.493 --> 51:23.908
Forget your Lolita complex.
Punish her for intruding.

51:23.998 --> 51:27.787
It's no Lolita complex. I'm a feminist.

51:28.127 --> 51:33.498
Enemy or not,
the feminist way is to be nice to women.

51:55.487 --> 51:58.946
Zura! Where are you?

51:58.991 --> 52:03.827
You're here, right? If
you're here, answer me!

52:16.592 --> 52:18.834
Seize her now!

52:25.643 --> 52:26.850
What a brat...

52:26.894 --> 52:30.558
Zura, wait for me.

52:31.023 --> 52:33.060
I'm coming for you.

52:37.655 --> 52:39.567
Heck, she's headed for the factory!

52:53.587 --> 52:55.203
What is this?

52:56.882 --> 53:00.967
I can't let you live now you've seen that.

53:15.442 --> 53:20.483
If your sword is just for self-protection,
cast it away.

53:22.700 --> 53:28.071
"Bushido for Beginners"

53:41.301 --> 53:42.883
It's not about self-preservation.

53:43.554 --> 53:47.594
It's about retaining your soul
and protecting what's important to you.

53:57.234 --> 53:58.475
Gintoki...

54:06.285 --> 54:08.242
Can't you hear it?

54:09.830 --> 54:11.162
That voice?

54:13.625 --> 54:15.241
I can still hear it.

54:18.630 --> 54:20.792
That black beast inside me...

54:21.633 --> 54:24.626
writhing and twisting.

54:33.103 --> 54:35.561
I must keep fighting...

54:38.066 --> 54:40.604
until it stops tormenting me.

55:02.508 --> 55:05.000
Ouch, ouch...

55:08.597 --> 55:10.304
You're awake?

55:11.600 --> 55:13.216
What a relief.

55:13.477 --> 55:17.517
You were so still I
thought you'd slip away.

55:17.606 --> 55:20.724
How do you feel? Are you fully conscious?

55:21.276 --> 55:23.563
Do you know who I am?

55:25.614 --> 55:28.027
The lady whose food tastes like puke.

55:33.205 --> 55:35.162
Why are you here?

55:35.541 --> 55:37.373
It's what my brother wanted.

55:37.709 --> 55:39.826
Told me to be your nurse.

55:41.547 --> 55:44.255
Why does my nurse have a spear?

55:44.424 --> 55:46.586
It's what my brother wanted.

55:47.052 --> 55:51.513
I'm to ensure you rest
and stop you if you leave.

55:51.640 --> 55:53.256
Stop me how?

55:53.976 --> 55:55.217
Stop my breathing?

55:56.520 --> 55:58.056
Funny joke.

55:59.189 --> 56:02.978
You must be getting better, then.

56:03.652 --> 56:05.939
Is it a joke, I wonder...

56:06.905 --> 56:12.446
Okay then, let's read Dragon Ball.

56:28.176 --> 56:30.338
A lot of onomatopoeias.

56:41.231 --> 56:42.722
Impressive performance.

56:46.612 --> 56:48.729
Is it over?

56:52.618 --> 56:55.076
What a fright!

56:55.287 --> 56:58.075
- "Are you feeling lucky?"
- Don't do Frieza, I beg you.

56:58.081 --> 56:59.743
Don't do Frieza, I beg you.

56:59.875 --> 57:01.457
That's enough!

57:06.256 --> 57:09.875
Where are Shinpachi and Kagura?

57:09.927 --> 57:12.135
- Running errands.
- What kind?

57:12.179 --> 57:15.013
Don't worry, the patient should rest.

57:16.058 --> 57:17.640
They're searching for Zura...

57:20.854 --> 57:23.187
I told you to keep still.

57:23.565 --> 57:27.605
What if your wound re-opens, fool?

57:31.573 --> 57:33.940
Just kidding.

57:35.911 --> 57:39.530
No, you're not. You're dead serious.

57:39.623 --> 57:40.784
Tongue-in-cheek.

57:41.166 --> 57:44.955
You're for real.
Plus that's not tongue-in-cheek.

58:11.947 --> 58:13.233
Sadaharu...

58:14.783 --> 58:17.651
I wish I'd turned up earlier.

58:18.704 --> 58:23.540
Although maybe I'd have ended up dead.

58:24.710 --> 58:27.999
Elizabeth was cut in half, then vanished.

58:28.547 --> 58:31.210
Do all aliens do that, I wonder?

58:31.758 --> 58:32.794
Hey...

58:34.136 --> 58:36.298
No point in asking you, I guess...

58:41.685 --> 58:44.018
What's that huge ship?

58:47.065 --> 58:49.557
You've picked up Katsura's scent?

58:51.903 --> 58:54.987
Then Kagura might be aboard, too.

58:55.323 --> 58:57.736
I need to go save her.

59:02.039 --> 59:04.076
But how can I sneak in?

59:04.249 --> 59:07.583
Fierce-looking ronin are everywhere.

59:07.753 --> 59:10.791
Boy and big dog, what are you doing?

59:11.506 --> 59:16.171
Just... admiring the ship. It's so cool.

59:16.178 --> 59:18.261
Totally cool, right?

59:19.765 --> 59:24.760
I'd love to board it.
Cap'n Kodai was my TV hero.

59:24.936 --> 59:26.472
- No way!?
- Yep.

59:26.521 --> 59:29.855
- Shima was my guy.
- He was cool, too!

59:30.400 --> 59:32.892
I'd love to take a look.

59:32.944 --> 59:36.187
"Listen, Kodai,
only you can fire the pulse cannon."

59:36.448 --> 59:38.565
"You're right, Shima. Lead the way."

59:38.575 --> 59:39.986
"Let's go."

59:40.035 --> 59:42.277
"Steady as she goes."

59:42.329 --> 59:44.537
- As if I'd allow it.
- I was so close.

59:44.539 --> 59:46.997
- As if I'd allow it.
- As if you would.

59:47.042 --> 59:50.080
It's funnier with your hand on your hip.

59:54.883 --> 59:57.216
That's good comic banter.

59:57.219 --> 59:58.960
Shut up, four-eyes!

59:59.513 --> 01:00:04.133
What do you know of comic timing!?

01:00:04.351 --> 01:00:05.637
Scram!

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.636
Scram!

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:09.145
Such a short fuse.

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:14.608
It's locked down really tight.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.813
I should hurry for Kagura's sake.

01:00:21.159 --> 01:00:23.822
Not that I can tell Gin-san...

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:33.586
The rent's due. Go pay it.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:34.746
Okay.

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:37.881
Spot me the cash, please.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.254
No way.

01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:42.003
But I'm injured.

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:45.344
You know the saying,
"Cash speeds the cure"?

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:48.635
I'm afraid not.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:53.686
Make an excuse and send her away.

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:57.769
If you insist.

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:03.028
Coming...

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:06.528
Oh, you're not the landlord.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:09.409
May I help you?

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:12.204
- Well...
- I'm afraid Gin-san is...

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:13.663
I'm right here.

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:19.457
Come on in.

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:22.881
I was expecting you.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.808
You got your ass kicked, huh?

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:42.989
You took Benizakura without permission,
only to run back here minus an arm.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.192
Are you prepared...

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:49.412
to commit hara-kiri, Okada-san?

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:55.956
I'd prefer credit for returning the sword
despite my injury.

01:01:56.838 --> 01:02:00.252
It was a valuable test run for both of us.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:04.089
Your selfish behavior has gone too far.

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:09.224
What do we do when the Bakufu dogs
learn of the sword's existence?

01:02:09.517 --> 01:02:13.477
A Shinsengumi agent saw you fight Gintoki.

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:17.022
You're a hindrance to Lord Shinsuke.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:18.436
Honestly...

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:23.688
Katsura, then Gintoki.
Why target those so close to Lord Shinsuke?

01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:25.401
What are you up to?

01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:31.204
Don't delude yourself about your new power.

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:35.117
You only defeated them
because of the sword...

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:39.044
Whoops.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:42.210
Don't take this personally.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.376
It's not me.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:49.551
It's the sword's doing.

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:56.559
It's gradually possessing me from within.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:02.652
Claiming my body as its own.

01:03:04.155 --> 01:03:07.614
You'd better mind your manners now.

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:15.615
You want to tell me the truth, right?

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:21.996
Don't give me that demon
sword speech again.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:24.586
What the hell is it?

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:28.924
Who really made that monstrosity?

01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:35.927
Okada-san...

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:38.558
They're obstacles to us.

01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:47.189
We're in this with Takasugi
to wreak havoc on the Bakufu's corruption.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:49.944
In other words...

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:54.366
we aim to become legends, right?

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:57.949
How long do we tolerate those fools.

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.034
They're a distraction.

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:03.663
They stand in our way.

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:07.424
Surely it's time for old legends to fade...

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:11.758
and to cause new legends to be written.

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:16.342
They no longer stand with Takasugi.

01:04:18.188 --> 01:04:19.724
That is our place now.

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:21.646
This Benizakura...

01:04:22.484 --> 01:04:28.822
was designed as a weapon
to take out battleships.

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:35.203
It's endowed with an artificial intelligence
which feeds off the bearer's body.

01:04:36.414 --> 01:04:42.160
It analyzes combat data
and grows smarter with use.

01:04:43.004 --> 01:04:44.666
It's truly a living blade.

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:46.831
Like that manga, Parasyte.

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:51.587
Is it going to talk
and introduce itself as "Migi"?

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:55.298
Only one man in Edo could
create such a thing.

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:59.222
I beg you. Stop my brother.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:01.353
Takasugi's gang...

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.775
They'll use it to burn Edo to the ground.

01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:09.152
It's almost perverse.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.450
To create such a weapon
in an era of cannon and flintlock...

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:19.201
A man who boasts
about overthrowing a government...

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:21.707
is equally perverse perhaps.

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:27.500
He who turns boasts into reality
is hailed as a hero.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:31.880
I don't deal in empty boasts.

01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:39.266
I'll show them that Samurai and swordplay
are far from extinct.

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:44.730
I'm not interested in your ambition.

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:48.271
I live only to create the finest blade.

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:51.400
All I know is...

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:55.032
this particular sword...

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.035
can cut through everything.

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:00.321
I don't know how it happened...

01:06:00.915 --> 01:06:04.454
but your brother's mixed up
in some heavy stuff.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:06.578
And...

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:12.212
for one thing, he played me for a fool.

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:19.387
He wanted me to find that sword,
so it could drink my blood.

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:23.852
Or maybe he was doing Nizo a favor...

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:27.144
or maybe it was both.

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:31.269
In any case, it's a terrible thing.

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:35.109
And you knew all along, right?

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:39.952
You knew his plan, and
yet you said nothing.

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:43.531
And now you ask me to save him?

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.875
Is your skin as thick as the Yellow Pages?

01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:49.749
Don't use odd metaphors.

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:54.004
I'm sorry, I have nothing to say.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:58.087
Like you said, I knew everything.

01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:02.887
But he'd be in such trouble
if the secret got out.

01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:05.887
So I never told anyone.

01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:09.815
Such a loyal little sister.

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:14.688
Ignoring the fact
that he's an accomplice to murder.

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:16.317
Gin-san!

01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:20.075
A sword is just a glorified
butcher's knife.

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:24.155
However pure the maker's intent,
he can't dictate who uses it.

01:07:24.832 --> 01:07:27.165
My late father used to say that.

01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:31.291
Those words are ingrained on our hearts.

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:36.050
My brother simply lives to make swords.

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:40.425
He constantly forged steel
to surpass our father's legacy.

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:44.684
He'll never reach his father's standards.

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:48.767
That man was a worthy swordsmith.

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:51.102
The son hasn't got it in him.

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:58.109
So he began to study mechanics
to gain greater power.

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:09.750
And started to associate
with shady characters.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:16.424
I guessed they might be evil,
but I didn't stop him.

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:28.470
I just told myself that our job
was simply to make swords.

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:32.227
I know that a sword is a butcher's tool.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:38.442
A tool for murdering people.

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:42.529
But I'm so torn...

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:49.290
My brother's devotion to his work
is being so misused.

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:51.582
It's too late.

01:08:52.252 --> 01:08:56.122
It's reached a point beyond my control.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:09:00.835
I'm at my wit's end. What can I do?

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:07.595
I don't know any more than you.

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:13.560
I'm badly injured, my friend is gone...

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:16.600
My head's spinning with it all.

01:09:17.944 --> 01:09:19.106
Here...

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:23.611
I don't want consolation money.
Just get out of here.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.277
I'm fed up of it all.

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.823
Gin-san...

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:35.419
That bastard Nizo is really out of control.

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:38.747
Bring me more!

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:45.254
Keep bringing more ramen!

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:47.221
What the hell's her problem?

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.022
Another helping!

01:09:56.317 --> 01:09:57.728
What are you all doing?

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:01.319
Young girls at her age...

01:10:01.322 --> 01:10:05.407
are at their most beautiful while they eat.

01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:09.946
I had them join her, so
she wouldn't be lonely.

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:13.953
Kagura finishes the lot.
She's leader of the pack!

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:15.041
Another helping.

01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:19.919
At this rate, she'll empty the
ship's stores. Kill her already.

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:24.585
Not a good idea
before she coughs up some information.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.011
Another helping!

01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:31.308
Kagura-dearest...

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:34.053
Still hungry, honey?

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:36.851
The ex-champion is at her heels!

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:39.024
Here you go.

01:10:39.193 --> 01:10:41.435
Do I have to kill you first?

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:46.399
Calm down, okay?
In a few years girls like this...

01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:50.615
reach their juicy prime.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:53.034
Your Lolita complex's gone far enough.

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:55.995
It's not a Lolita complex. I'm a feminist.

01:10:56.252 --> 01:11:00.212
Whatever. Just end this bad TV show.

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:03.131
Look at that.

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:09.055
The gunshot wound healed overnight...
She's got incredible strength.

01:11:09.182 --> 01:11:15.270
That white skin, so supple.
Its soft perfection impervious to sweat.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.312
Stop it, right now.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.980
I'm a feminist, I tell you.
With a love of youth.

01:11:22.069 --> 01:11:23.981
The definition of a Lolita complex!

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:28.240
Never mind.
You're an idiot who'll never understand.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:29.365
You're the idiot.

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:31.572
What I'm referring to...

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:36.662
are classic Yato-clan characteristics.
So piss off and die.

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:37.699
You die.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:40.456
You mean the mercenary clan, Yato?

01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:44.378
So is she a professional assassin hired
to kill our Lord Shinsuke?

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:46.918
Who the hell is she working for?

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:51.259
She always answers "Zura."

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:55.593
Is that a regional accent?

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:58.225
Senpai, she's manipulating you.

01:11:58.606 --> 01:12:02.566
Watch how easily I handle her.

01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:05.898
Hey, bitch!

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.617
It's Bakabon.

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:16.872
She looks like him.

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:21.459
I'm gonna kill you!

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:25.874
Chill. In a few years
she'll be a heart-stopper.

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:28.338
Don't pervert the course of justice.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:31.052
Stop calling me a pervert.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:34.715
It's a great relief.

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:40.225
I was afraid
you'd try to leave despite your injury.

01:12:42.483 --> 01:12:45.897
You'd surely die, wouldn't you?

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:48.395
I guess so, yeah...

01:12:48.447 --> 01:12:52.908
I feel sorry for that girl,
but it can't be helped.

01:12:53.244 --> 01:12:55.486
I guess so, yeah...

01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:57.866
Gin-san...

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:03.995
Please don't overdo it.

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:09.834
If you die, Shinpachi and
Kagura would be lost.

01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:12.586
I guess so, yeah...

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:19.594
You misspent a wild youth,
but now you've got to act your age.

01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:24.728
Quit lecturing me, you cow!
I'll stay put, but go buy me a Jump manga.

01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:27.768
The candy shop on the corner sells it.

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:30.487
Okay, okay...

01:13:52.887 --> 01:13:56.927
"Meet me at the swordsmith - Gintoki"

01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:05.347
Sorry about this.

01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:13.234
I hate to play the impulsive punk
at my age, but...

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:33.213
"This is my favorite umbrella
- Be sure to return it"

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:54.234
That's one headstrong woman.

01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:58.025
That's one stupid man.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:22.181
I got to hear every word.

01:15:22.226 --> 01:15:25.264
Don't look so pleased with yourself.

01:15:25.312 --> 01:15:29.852
If you don't have a warrant,
you're a cop breaking the law.

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:31.683
Everything I do...

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:35.107
I do for you.

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:39.783
Then quit boasting about
doing illegal stuff.

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:42.823
Never fear, the Shinsengumi's here.

01:15:47.835 --> 01:15:50.418
This is so not funny, Gorilla.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:54.423
Count on us, the Shinsengumi!

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:57.631
Shut up and get the hell out of here!

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:10.601
Hey, you...

01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:13.517
Who the hell are you?

01:16:13.903 --> 01:16:18.614
It's me. Me, you know!

01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:23.285
Oh, yeah, it's you. Sorry!

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:25.616
So you should be.

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:29.541
Who the hell are you?

01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:32.168
You're not from around here.

01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:36.628
It's me. Remember?

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:41.302
Oh, sorry. It's you, of course.

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:43.384
Really, guys, I'm disappointed.

01:16:44.475 --> 01:16:47.809
That was easier than I thought.
No wonder old folk get scammed.

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:01.155
"Gengai's Lab"

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.412
Hey, you...

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:21.377
What a rare surprise, Gintoki.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:25.510
Can I be straight with you?

01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:28.175
Sure.

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:33.601
I'm up against a machine...

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:38.189
It's a guy with a
super-powered robot sword.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:43.824
In Samurai movies the hero fights
on despite his wounds, right?

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:46.701
Especially Ken Takakura films.

01:17:47.204 --> 01:17:49.537
But I just sense I can't win.

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:55.707
So you need my mechanical expertise?

01:17:57.631 --> 01:18:01.375
Honestly, I'm in agony from this injury.

01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:04.590
I'm hoping you've got an easy way out.

01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:10.551
An easy way out?
That's the opposite of Bushido, you know.

01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:13.227
I know. I need an easy victory.

01:18:13.397 --> 01:18:16.936
I love life. I want to survive.
More than Nobunaga even.

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:23.196
No Samurai movie hero
ever had a line like that.

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:27.743
Sadly, I have nothing for you right now...

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:33.581
Give me this.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:35.416
With this, I can kick ass!

01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:41.002
Sorry. It's a repair for another client.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:42.461
Hello!

01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:44.676
Is the repair done?

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.757
Yes, sir. It's ready now.

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:48.842
That's perfect. I'm so glad.

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:50.598
Excuse me, may I borrow it?

01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:53.351
- Let me see.
- It's right in front of you.

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:56.103
Send the bill to my regiment.

01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:59.225
You're older than in the anime.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:00.851
I'm just a kid.

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:03.695
That's your line from the manga.

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:06.277
You seem fit enough to me.

01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:07.483
Are you Artesia?

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:08.692
I'm Sakata.

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:12.784
Then I'm off to Side 7.

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:16.708
First, I need a piss. May I?

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:17.868
Sure, it's over there.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.411
Don't be so crass.

01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:23.047
My bladder's small and
my piss smells sweet.

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:24.336
That's diabetes.

01:19:24.385 --> 01:19:29.050
I'll zip there at super-human speed.

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:36.519
Looked like normal speed to me.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:40.311
I guess he's normally a lot slower.

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:44.236
Gintoki! I've got something that'll help.

01:19:44.405 --> 01:19:48.274
Why didn't you tell me in the first place?

01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:50.567
A few bites of this...

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.657
That fruit?

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:56.748
Your whole body becomes rubber.

01:19:56.959 --> 01:20:00.498
But I don't want to turn
into the Pirate King.

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:02.583
Boing-Boing Gintoki...

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:05.043
Perfect, eh?

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:07.671
Sail to the Grand Line!

01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:13.757
Really? I hate the ocean, though.

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:22.857
Just kidding. It's fake.

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:26.979
It's just a normal melon.
Totally fooled you.

01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:29.774
Humans can't become rubber.

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:32.943
You read too much manga.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:36.116
Your brain's turned to mush.

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:37.868
You read too much manga.

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:39.958
Ouch...

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:43.583
Ouch, ouch. That's not fair.

01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:47.624
You're in fine fighting form, eh?

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:53.258
That really hurt.

01:21:25.839 --> 01:21:27.330
Sakata-san...

01:21:28.509 --> 01:21:29.841
Hello.

01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:41.264
Hey, lassie...

01:21:41.355 --> 01:21:43.688
I'm in a foul mood.

01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:48.894
Cough up the reason you're here,
or you're a dead man. Speak.

01:21:48.946 --> 01:21:55.785
If you kindly comply, I'll defer the event
for a couple of years, hopefully.

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:57.194
Spit it out!

01:21:59.081 --> 01:22:00.447
She's vomiting.

01:22:08.507 --> 01:22:11.625
She just did what she was told.

01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:15.546
More is on its way!

01:22:18.058 --> 01:22:20.550
What's up with me?

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:24.721
Don't tell me...

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:26.814
Am I pregnant?

01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:29.104
Either over-eating or sea-sickness, stupid!

01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:38.493
You say the funniest things, Kagura-honey.

01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:42.907
We can't kill someone
blessed with such humor.

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:45.750
Please shut up, Lolita.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.328
Time's up.

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:50.500
Now you die.

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:53.383
Wait one darn minute!

01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:02.096
A girly cat fight is no reason...

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:04.514
for my friend to die.

01:23:04.563 --> 01:23:08.102
Shinpachi! You came to save me!

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:14.028
Sorry I took my time, Kagura-chan.

01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:15.613
Who the hell are you?

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:19.112
Don't make me repeat myself.

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:22.613
I'm her sidekick.

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:25.574
How many in your army?

01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:42.507
Well? What's up, dear boy?

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:45.643
Don't mumble, sweetie.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:49.605
Are your lips quivering?

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:53.192
All on your lonesome?

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:57.488
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:01.154
Is that so?

01:24:02.788 --> 01:24:04.324
So, you know...

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:08.374
I just decided...

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:13.167
to go it alone.

01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:17.175
Whoopsy. Are you girding your loins?

01:24:18.554 --> 01:24:24.141
Was that pop from a little button?
Really? A button on a kimono?

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:27.352
Did you hope we wouldn't hear it?

01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:32.440
Are you really prepared to fight?

01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:41.529
Can't we settle this without bloodshed?

01:24:41.702 --> 01:24:43.034
Surely we can?

01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:47.197
Shouldn't think so.

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:50.040
- Can I kill him?
- Be my guest.

01:24:52.045 --> 01:24:55.038
Wait, wait.

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:56.331
Spare him.

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:59.918
Silly four-eyes is just a big silly.

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:05.307
Kagura, dear, I've no
interest in young boys.

01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:11.555
Shinpachi!

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:20.070
What's going on?

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:25.410
We're under attack from
a Shinsengumi vessel!

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:27.403
What?

01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:31.616
Heck, this is Nizo's fault.

01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:34.414
All hands, battle stations!

01:25:39.593 --> 01:25:40.754
Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:25:40.802 --> 01:25:43.089
I knew you'd be here.

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:44.345
Forgive me.

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:48.592
Where's Gin-chan? Why's he not here?

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:53.605
He'll be here... any minute.

01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:22.462
So...

01:26:35.232 --> 01:26:37.724
Sorry to interrupt your suffering.

01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:40.977
But your guests have arrived.

01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:46.032
You really stirred the pot, huh?

01:26:47.452 --> 01:26:48.818
Now thanks to you...

01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:53.915
you've forced my hand
in fighting the Bakufu.

01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:01.669
I hear you killed Katsura.

01:27:03.385 --> 01:27:05.843
Then tangled with Gintoki.

01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:09.847
Even got Tetsuya Murata involved?

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:13.513
So...

01:27:16.022 --> 01:27:18.264
Did you collect good data at least?

01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:21.730
Murata must be happy about that.

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:27.483
He only cares about that sword
growing in strength.

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:30.026
How are you?

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:34.872
Your old buddies succumbed so easily...

01:27:37.711 --> 01:27:39.452
Are you feeling sad?

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:41.913
Alternatively...

01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:51.139
That's an impressive arm you've grown.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:54.683
I'm glad you're getting along so well.

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:59.647
Like the saying, "Sword
and warrior as one."

01:28:05.363 --> 01:28:07.400
Go and crush them all.

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:13.070
Wipe them all out,
and I'll forgive your indiscretion.

01:28:15.457 --> 01:28:19.827
There had to be a showdown at some point.

01:28:21.838 --> 01:28:23.170
One other thing...

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:31.428
Never again refer to Gintoki as my buddy.

01:28:32.599 --> 01:28:36.434
Things are more complicated than you know.

01:28:39.105 --> 01:28:41.722
Say it again, and I'll kill you both.

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:59.290
I see what's going on.
But is Katsura really here?

01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:02.501
Sadaharu said it, so I'm sure.

01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:11.135
Boarding attack!

01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:20.098
How could you eat that before battle?

01:29:20.230 --> 01:29:22.973
If you get cut, you'll
bleed mayo, not blood.

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:25.141
I've got to get my strength up.

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.309
Gross.

01:29:26.945 --> 01:29:28.106
Let's go.

01:29:29.072 --> 01:29:30.313
Kondo-san.

01:29:31.825 --> 01:29:33.862
You should stay on the ship.

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:37.905
This will be a bitter
fight and many will fall.

01:29:38.248 --> 01:29:42.538
What would become of Shinsengumi
if the unthinkable happens?

01:29:43.086 --> 01:29:44.247
Okita...

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:49.750
I made a vow when I formed our force...

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:53.636
I live or die alongside my men.

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:58.557
That is Isao Kondo's destiny.

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.346
Kondo-san.

01:30:06.318 --> 01:30:08.355
Shinsengumi will never die.

01:30:10.488 --> 01:30:11.820
Well done, kid.

01:30:12.908 --> 01:30:14.399
Kondo-san...

01:30:17.287 --> 01:30:18.494
Well...

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:25.330
Let's deal death to those devils.

01:30:31.593 --> 01:30:34.381
Kondo-san!

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:47.643
- Let's go.
- Sure.

01:30:49.945 --> 01:30:51.402
Uh-oh...

01:30:51.446 --> 01:30:53.904
Looks like it already kicked-off.

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:56.072
It'll be over before we arrive.

01:30:56.076 --> 01:31:00.116
One swing of Benizakura
has the firepower of 10 ships.

01:31:00.163 --> 01:31:04.407
As much as a pulse cannon?
Or a Turtle Devastation Wave?

01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:07.247
I've not seen either, so can't comment.

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:08.911
But in any case...

01:31:08.964 --> 01:31:10.125
What's this?

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:16.386
A sword I forged. Use this against
Benizakura over your wooden one.

01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:21.512
That's cool, but what's this?

01:31:22.477 --> 01:31:24.685
This decoration on the hilt?

01:31:24.854 --> 01:31:26.937
Looks like poo...

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:31.642
It's not poop, it's a coiled dragon!

01:31:31.695 --> 01:31:37.612
I hadn't finished my sentence,
which means you agree!

01:31:37.659 --> 01:31:39.992
Anyway, how do we get up there?

01:31:39.995 --> 01:31:43.284
You're a worse listener than your brother.

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:44.447
Hey, Gintoki.

01:31:44.958 --> 01:31:47.416
Sorry about earlier. This is for you.

01:31:53.633 --> 01:31:58.173
It was in for repair,
but the client said you can use it.

01:31:58.471 --> 01:31:59.461
Here you go.

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:04.134
This isn't the windy
valley, so will it work?

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:09.180
Legally, did we cross the line there?

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:10.852
Quick, before Ohmu turns angry.

01:32:12.152 --> 01:32:13.313
That's very kind.

01:32:13.778 --> 01:32:15.565
Are you sure it's kosher?

01:32:15.989 --> 01:32:17.480
It's impressive, huh?

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:21.200
Taking it to the limit of legality, eh?

01:32:21.619 --> 01:32:23.906
Go, Gintoki. Go.

01:32:24.497 --> 01:32:26.739
Thank you, Na... caa.

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:30.042
You're sure we can take this?

01:32:30.086 --> 01:32:31.327
It's fine.

01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:35.214
It's the Shinsengumi!

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.116
Okada...

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:08.823
Nizo...

01:33:14.672 --> 01:33:17.460
Nizo Okada, you're under arrest...

01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:22.094
on suspicion of the serial murders.

01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:28.305
Welcome, dogs of the Bakufu.

01:33:31.648 --> 01:33:32.638
What the...

01:33:32.690 --> 01:33:35.478
Pretty good for a sword...

01:33:35.693 --> 01:33:36.979
Well, well...

01:33:39.948 --> 01:33:43.988
So much for the long arm of the law.

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:48.204
I've got no choice. This way, sir.

01:33:51.876 --> 01:33:53.833
Cut him up if you must.

01:33:53.878 --> 01:33:56.871
Okita, you traitor!

01:33:58.341 --> 01:34:04.838
As if you Keystone Cops could detain us...

01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:09.050
This can't be happening!

01:34:16.568 --> 01:34:20.528
These are the same as Nizo's sword...

01:34:21.281 --> 01:34:22.647
Yet so many of them...

01:34:23.074 --> 01:34:24.360
Oh, deary me...

01:34:26.619 --> 01:34:29.578
This is no place for boys and girls.

01:34:30.373 --> 01:34:33.491
Shinsuke Takasugi!

01:34:34.878 --> 01:34:39.088
Why did you attack your
old comrade Gin-san?

01:34:40.466 --> 01:34:43.334
What happened to Gin-chan?

01:34:45.597 --> 01:34:47.088
Comrade?

01:34:48.474 --> 01:34:50.431
I wonder if he's my comrade...

01:34:52.478 --> 01:34:56.188
So Gintoki hangs out with kids now?

01:34:56.816 --> 01:35:01.936
What did you do to Gin-chan?
I may have to kill you.

01:35:02.739 --> 01:35:06.779
In that case, you're all destined...

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:09.655
to live happily ever after in heaven!

01:35:14.167 --> 01:35:15.658
- Elizabeth!
- Ellie!!

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:22.714
"This is tricky. Run!"

01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:25.627
I'm so happy you're alive.

01:35:25.929 --> 01:35:26.840
"Run away now!"

01:35:27.055 --> 01:35:29.638
But he's real strong, Ellie.

01:35:29.933 --> 01:35:30.923
"Leave him to me"

01:35:32.185 --> 01:35:34.347
Elizabeth!

01:35:36.439 --> 01:35:40.934
Since when was this a costume party?

01:35:41.861 --> 01:35:44.649
I said it wasn't fit for kids.

01:35:48.618 --> 01:35:51.361
I'm not a kid, I'm Katsura.

01:35:51.537 --> 01:35:53.824
- Zura!
- What's with your hair?

01:35:55.541 --> 01:35:56.622
Lord Shinsuke!

01:35:56.626 --> 01:36:01.041
I didn't expect to see you here.

01:36:01.089 --> 01:36:05.049
Fancy meeting a dead man.

01:36:05.551 --> 01:36:08.168
I had unfinished business...

01:36:08.805 --> 01:36:11.422
so I returned from the underworld.

01:36:12.058 --> 01:36:16.678
After being killed by a comrade,
I couldn't rest in peace.

01:36:18.147 --> 01:36:20.389
Right, Takasugi?

01:36:21.484 --> 01:36:24.192
Don't call me "comrade."

01:36:27.407 --> 01:36:29.865
It does more harm than good.

01:36:30.743 --> 01:36:33.360
You still carry that?

01:36:38.835 --> 01:36:40.667
We're as bad as each other.

01:36:44.424 --> 01:36:48.418
Did that protect you from Benizakura?

01:36:50.263 --> 01:36:53.347
Fond memories die hard.

01:36:53.933 --> 01:36:59.099
I don't care
who is behind the scheme, you or Nizo...

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:05.856
I can't stand by
and let events go unchallenged.

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:08.396
You two...

01:37:08.906 --> 01:37:11.990
I'm sorry for dragging you into it.

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:15.702
I thought they were only after me.

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:22.247
I figured it'd be best
if people thought I was dead.

01:37:22.295 --> 01:37:24.002
You were more conspicuous than ever.

01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:26.087
Sorry, Zura...

01:37:27.508 --> 01:37:30.125
making you come all this way...

01:37:30.345 --> 01:37:33.964
but I can't surrender my ambition.

01:37:34.223 --> 01:37:37.216
Wait, Takasugi. Let's talk it through!

01:37:38.269 --> 01:37:39.760
Leave these guys to us.

01:37:40.355 --> 01:37:42.847
You go negotiate with Takasugi.

01:37:43.107 --> 01:37:44.223
Will you be okay?

01:37:44.942 --> 01:37:47.355
You'll treat us to goodies
afterwards, okay?

01:37:47.904 --> 01:37:51.318
If anything happens,
I won't be able to face Gintoki.

01:37:51.407 --> 01:37:52.989
Don't worry, just go.

01:37:53.076 --> 01:37:57.992
You owe me a year's worth
of seaweed snacks.

01:37:59.082 --> 01:38:00.243
Thanks, guys.

01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:27.273
You're tougher than I thought

01:38:28.111 --> 01:38:30.649
I should've killed you earlier.

01:38:30.655 --> 01:38:33.568
Don't underestimate the deputy chief!

01:38:41.791 --> 01:38:44.875
Even a feminist must show his dark side.

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:48.708
When careful plans are ruined,
fury is close behind!

01:38:48.798 --> 01:38:50.710
That's a feminist.

01:38:51.426 --> 01:38:53.042
A total non-sequitur.

01:38:53.052 --> 01:38:58.719
But I can't figure out
why you two are here?

01:39:00.643 --> 01:39:04.136
You're neither resistance
fighters nor cops.

01:39:04.147 --> 01:39:06.230
And obviously not with us...

01:39:06.899 --> 01:39:08.356
Who the hell are you?

01:39:08.651 --> 01:39:12.235
What's your deal? Who sent you?

01:39:17.743 --> 01:39:21.578
The dumbest Samurai in the Universe!

01:39:21.998 --> 01:39:23.580
S'up?

01:39:28.337 --> 01:39:29.544
You...

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:32.797
He's mine.

01:39:33.092 --> 01:39:36.631
You go get Takasugi before he escapes.

01:39:36.846 --> 01:39:39.384
But in your condition...

01:39:39.432 --> 01:39:41.424
I could say the same for you.

01:39:41.767 --> 01:39:44.760
You policeman do your job.

01:39:47.523 --> 01:39:50.607
Just don't die, Sakata.

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:14.043
I may be totally blind...

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:17.292
but I can feel the light.

01:40:18.721 --> 01:40:22.089
Your body is aglow...

01:40:23.893 --> 01:40:26.180
with a harsh silver light.

01:40:28.439 --> 01:40:30.681
But why is that?

01:40:31.150 --> 01:40:33.483
Something about that light...

01:40:35.238 --> 01:40:37.025
I just can't stand!

01:40:41.994 --> 01:40:45.283
Why are you here?
What can you do in your condition?

01:40:45.331 --> 01:40:48.165
Have you finally lost your mind?

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:53.079
You don't look so well yourself.

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:57.128
Like death warmed up.
Your bowels troubling you?

01:40:57.176 --> 01:40:59.759
You're the one with problems there.

01:41:13.025 --> 01:41:16.564
Uh-oh, someone's losing blood.

01:41:20.199 --> 01:41:24.569
Uh-oh, someone's losing blood.

01:41:49.145 --> 01:41:50.352
Zura.

01:41:50.813 --> 01:41:54.397
Look at Gintoki up there.

01:42:00.573 --> 01:42:02.940
He's as foolhardy as ever.

01:42:03.242 --> 01:42:06.406
Like facing a battleship
with his bare hands.

01:42:11.417 --> 01:42:13.784
Those moves are beyond human.

01:42:14.670 --> 01:42:19.381
His body's struggling to respond to
Benizakura's commands.

01:42:20.426 --> 01:42:22.042
That man is going to die.

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:24.927
You knew full well.

01:42:26.182 --> 01:42:29.050
You knew what the sword would do to him.

01:42:30.102 --> 01:42:34.312
But he's your comrade. Don't you care?

01:42:34.774 --> 01:42:39.860
That's his chosen destiny.

01:42:40.863 --> 01:42:43.731
In death, he'll find fulfillment.

01:42:44.033 --> 01:42:45.240
Fulfillment?

01:42:45.284 --> 01:42:46.820
That's right.

01:42:47.370 --> 01:42:52.866
He sought to become one with his sword.

01:42:53.793 --> 01:42:57.252
A sword that protects Takasugi, his beacon.

01:42:57.380 --> 01:43:03.251
To fly into fire not return to darkness.
To embrace its power.

01:43:03.552 --> 01:43:07.011
His eyes are blinded by the light.
It is all he can see.

01:43:07.223 --> 01:43:10.307
Piteous and foolish he may be.

01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:16.431
But inside lies a beauty
beyond good and evil.

01:43:16.816 --> 01:43:21.311
Like the beauty within
a single sword stroke.

01:43:22.363 --> 01:43:24.320
What's beautiful about it?

01:43:24.448 --> 01:43:26.986
Is that what you wanted to create?

01:43:27.326 --> 01:43:32.663
Stop it! I can't watch your swords
spill any more blood.

01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:39.040
Then why bring that man here?

01:43:39.755 --> 01:43:42.463
It's as if you lead him to his death.

01:43:43.509 --> 01:43:48.174
Can that dull blade vanquish
the perfection of my Benizakura?

01:43:53.519 --> 01:43:57.854
Impossible! He matched Benizakura's power.

01:43:58.691 --> 01:43:59.898
No...

01:44:00.609 --> 01:44:03.522
He's even stronger.

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:07.356
This shouldn't happen.

01:44:08.033 --> 01:44:11.743
Although Benizakura
drains Nizo's strength...

01:44:12.037 --> 01:44:16.907
it processes data
to find the opponent's weakness.

01:44:22.673 --> 01:44:23.959
It can't be!

01:44:24.049 --> 01:44:27.793
That man,
he's improving faster than Benizakura.

01:44:28.554 --> 01:44:29.761
No...

01:44:30.389 --> 01:44:36.556
The intensity of this duel
has reawakened dormant memories of battle.

01:44:37.104 --> 01:44:38.311
That...

01:44:47.031 --> 01:44:48.147
That is...

01:44:50.326 --> 01:44:51.908
the White Demon!

01:45:05.424 --> 01:45:07.256
I can't get rid of it...

01:45:08.761 --> 01:45:10.753
That distracting light...

01:45:12.598 --> 01:45:16.217
No matter how I try, the
silver light remains.

01:45:17.478 --> 01:45:19.265
It won't go out...

01:45:28.614 --> 01:45:31.573
It appears you have some dojo training...

01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:35.068
but haven't ever fought with a naked blade.

01:45:36.288 --> 01:45:38.871
Your hands are trembling.

01:45:41.544 --> 01:45:43.080
No, they're not!

01:45:44.964 --> 01:45:49.709
If I shake it, you see more than one sword.

01:45:50.010 --> 01:45:54.801
Like we used to do with pencils.

01:45:54.807 --> 01:45:57.470
It's weird, right?

01:45:57.518 --> 01:46:01.307
It's totally weird. Weird as hell. Really.

01:46:01.397 --> 01:46:05.437
I can see, one, two. Wow, so many...

01:46:05.484 --> 01:46:08.898
Distracting you thus, I strike!

01:46:15.995 --> 01:46:18.282
Your sword technique is crap.

01:46:21.166 --> 01:46:24.910
I'm more the cerebral type.

01:46:30.175 --> 01:46:33.964
I can win this. I can kick his ass.

01:46:35.848 --> 01:46:37.965
Such pain, I love it.

01:47:06.003 --> 01:47:07.119
Bingo!

01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:12.711
Got her!

01:47:19.391 --> 01:47:24.227
You couldn't catch me in a million years!

01:47:43.874 --> 01:47:45.240
Gin-san!

01:47:45.542 --> 01:47:46.658
Gin-chan!

01:47:52.549 --> 01:47:53.960
What the hell is this?

01:47:54.426 --> 01:47:55.667
Okada-san?

01:48:00.933 --> 01:48:04.643
Wish I could've lived to see Kagura mature.

01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:06.136
Senpai!

01:48:07.606 --> 01:48:10.940
Nizo, have you lost your mind?

01:48:11.777 --> 01:48:14.144
His consciousness is within the sword.

01:48:14.530 --> 01:48:18.274
I knew this kind of shit would happen.

01:48:25.708 --> 01:48:28.997
Benizakura has taken over.

01:48:29.712 --> 01:48:33.797
The self is gone and now
body has become sword.

01:48:34.633 --> 01:48:38.593
Not even the White Demon can stop it.

01:48:39.805 --> 01:48:46.268
Benizakura has attained perfection.
It's the ultimate sword.

01:48:46.395 --> 01:48:51.982
Its power accessible only to one
whose mind is centered and pure.

01:48:52.735 --> 01:48:58.606
People like you, minds full of nonsense,
cannot stand in its way.

01:48:58.657 --> 01:49:00.148
It won't go away...

01:49:01.243 --> 01:49:03.280
That blinding glare...

01:49:05.414 --> 01:49:08.828
it won't leave me alone.

01:49:13.130 --> 01:49:15.372
I'll rescue you!

01:49:18.761 --> 01:49:19.842
Tetsuko!

01:49:20.596 --> 01:49:24.681
I won't let it kill! I won't let him die!

01:49:25.392 --> 01:49:28.635
That sword must kill no more.

01:49:34.068 --> 01:49:37.186
Get those wriggly things off him!

01:49:42.701 --> 01:49:44.033
Why...

01:49:44.453 --> 01:49:48.538
Tetsuko, why can't you see?

01:49:49.291 --> 01:49:52.159
I devoted everything to Benizakura.

01:49:52.753 --> 01:49:56.713
I cast aside my conscience...

01:49:57.466 --> 01:50:00.550
It is all that I am.

01:50:01.095 --> 01:50:04.054
I lose everything if it goes.

01:50:17.986 --> 01:50:19.272
Tetsuko!

01:50:31.333 --> 01:50:36.829
Brother!

01:50:55.858 --> 01:50:57.099
Gin-san!

01:50:57.526 --> 01:51:00.610
Darling brother, hold on...

01:51:06.493 --> 01:51:08.951
Now, I see...

01:51:14.877 --> 01:51:17.620
I made myself free...

01:51:19.173 --> 01:51:21.631
Rid of everything but the sword.

01:51:23.969 --> 01:51:26.006
I forsook all stupid distractions...

01:51:27.681 --> 01:51:29.513
living solely to forge swords.

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:35.304
Living only for my creation.

01:51:36.732 --> 01:51:41.397
But in the very end...

01:51:44.531 --> 01:51:49.651
you, I couldn't forsake.

01:51:53.874 --> 01:51:56.491
With such a superficial approach...

01:51:58.587 --> 01:52:02.171
I was never going to
create the ultimate sword.

01:52:03.592 --> 01:52:06.380
Those weren't "stupid distractions."

01:52:08.639 --> 01:52:11.302
What do you mean by that?

01:52:14.228 --> 01:52:18.188
You thought your devotion was pure?

01:52:18.690 --> 01:52:20.556
You weren't a true craftsman.

01:52:20.943 --> 01:52:23.686
Don't be such a hypocrite.

01:52:24.696 --> 01:52:27.359
You just didn't have the guts...

01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:30.862
the guts to shoulder burdens...

01:52:32.579 --> 01:52:38.041
to face up to life and battle on.

01:52:38.543 --> 01:52:40.250
Quit playing the hero.

01:52:50.097 --> 01:52:51.554
Watch closely.

01:52:53.016 --> 01:52:56.885
Behold the power of "stupid distractions."

01:52:57.604 --> 01:53:02.065
Behold the quality of this sword
she poured her heart into.

01:53:04.486 --> 01:53:07.604
Burn this image into your mind.

01:53:07.698 --> 01:53:11.612
Gin-san, stop!
There's no way you can face Benizakura!

01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:13.071
Gin-chan!

01:53:36.643 --> 01:53:37.850
Tetsuko.

01:53:39.104 --> 01:53:41.642
What kind of sword do you want to make?

01:53:45.652 --> 01:53:46.938
One that protects.

01:53:47.487 --> 01:53:50.855
What? Speak up!

01:53:51.867 --> 01:53:54.530
A sword that protects people.

01:54:17.351 --> 01:54:19.843
A sword that protects people...

01:54:22.356 --> 01:54:25.724
That's so like you, Tetsuko.

01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:29.902
It would seem...

01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:34.733
I didn't have the skill.

01:54:42.542 --> 01:54:43.999
Tetsuko...

01:54:47.255 --> 01:54:49.497
A great swordsmith...

01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:53.217
you've become.

01:54:58.767 --> 01:55:00.804
I can't hear you...

01:55:02.104 --> 01:55:07.350
Speak to me in your normal voice.

01:55:13.407 --> 01:55:14.693
Takasugi...

01:55:15.409 --> 01:55:19.403
I don't like you. I never have.

01:55:21.415 --> 01:55:25.705
But I've always considered us comrades.

01:55:27.421 --> 01:55:31.381
When did our paths start to diverge?

01:55:31.425 --> 01:55:33.462
What are you trying to say?

01:55:37.472 --> 01:55:41.716
Even though we started in the same place...

01:55:42.269 --> 01:55:47.765
our eyes were fixed on different goals.

01:55:49.067 --> 01:55:51.730
We've always walked alone.

01:55:53.238 --> 01:55:56.697
Each of us following our own path.

01:56:00.745 --> 01:56:04.034
I haven't changed and neither has my goal.

01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:12.380
The man you are now lost the will
to put away his sword.

01:56:12.507 --> 01:56:15.250
You're just a marauding
beast enjoying chaos.

01:56:16.011 --> 01:56:18.924
If you hate this new country,
then seek its destruction.

01:56:19.347 --> 01:56:23.057
But if you risk harming
the people of Edo...

01:56:23.518 --> 01:56:25.430
I can't stand by and do nothing.

01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:31.857
What I'm after...

01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:36.778
hasn't ever changed.

01:56:38.158 --> 01:56:39.274
I...

01:56:39.326 --> 01:56:41.363
Takasugi! You bastard.

01:56:45.373 --> 01:56:48.992
Katsura's head will fetch a pretty price.

01:56:57.511 --> 01:57:00.720
Did you join forces with Amanto?

01:57:04.059 --> 01:57:08.975
Sorry. I couldn't save him.

01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:28.915
Gentlemen of the Shinsengumi, a word...

01:57:29.417 --> 01:57:31.249
You came through it okay?

01:57:31.836 --> 01:57:36.331
I reckon this ship's about done for.

01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:39.463
Can you take my guys and leave?

01:57:41.096 --> 01:57:44.134
But you're in no state to fight.

01:57:44.432 --> 01:57:46.014
That's right, Gin-san.

01:57:46.101 --> 01:57:48.263
Gin-chan, you might die.

01:57:48.436 --> 01:57:53.022
Don't worry, he's my friend.

01:57:53.733 --> 01:57:54.894
Trust me.

01:57:55.735 --> 01:57:57.601
I'll go talk to him.

01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:01.901
Okay?

01:58:02.951 --> 01:58:04.317
I need your help.

01:58:07.080 --> 01:58:08.366
Got it.

01:58:12.127 --> 01:58:15.962
You're saying I should ditch Benizakura?

01:58:18.091 --> 01:58:20.708
Joining forces with the Amanto?

01:58:21.428 --> 01:58:24.171
A new low, even for you, Takasugi.

01:58:29.477 --> 01:58:30.638
Funny...

01:58:32.439 --> 01:58:35.477
You really beat him in that state?

01:58:38.486 --> 01:58:43.902
Didn't we once fight to free the nation
from the Amanto?

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:51.075
Gintoki...

01:58:52.375 --> 01:58:59.043
When you guys took up arms
for comrades and country...

01:59:00.342 --> 01:59:02.709
none of that meant anything to me.

01:59:05.138 --> 01:59:06.674
Think about it.

01:59:08.516 --> 01:59:11.975
Who taught us how to fight?

01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:15.597
Who taught us Bushido?

01:59:15.774 --> 01:59:19.734
The rightful path and all that we know?

01:59:20.612 --> 01:59:24.276
Who gave us a place in this world?

01:59:25.325 --> 01:59:26.941
It was all Master Shoyo.

01:59:28.370 --> 01:59:29.781
And yet...

01:59:31.748 --> 01:59:35.287
the world took him away from us.

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:40.288
So we've no choice but to fight back.

01:59:40.924 --> 01:59:46.010
To smash the corrupt system
that robbed us of him.

01:59:49.099 --> 01:59:50.635
So, Gintoki...

01:59:52.018 --> 01:59:55.011
What do you live for in this world?

01:59:56.856 --> 02:00:03.148
In the face of a world that stole him away,
how can you be so easygoing?

02:00:05.532 --> 02:00:07.319
Because parfaits are delicious.

02:00:11.663 --> 02:00:17.830
For me, there's nothing in this world
I feel like destroying.

02:00:20.255 --> 02:00:21.712
For me...

02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:27.759
there's too much I want to protect.

02:00:36.771 --> 02:00:38.387
Takasugi!

02:00:41.943 --> 02:00:46.153
Get out of our way, fools!
I'll plug you full of holes.

02:00:46.197 --> 02:00:47.529
Let's go, Lord Shinsuke.

02:00:47.615 --> 02:00:48.731
Move...

02:00:50.577 --> 02:00:53.035
I'd have to face him sometime.

02:01:33.244 --> 02:01:34.360
Gintoki!

02:03:01.165 --> 02:03:02.406
Sakata!

02:03:02.458 --> 02:03:04.040
Stay out of it.

02:03:14.596 --> 02:03:16.132
So, then...

02:03:17.599 --> 02:03:20.091
Can you actually do it?

02:03:47.045 --> 02:03:49.458
You're too sweet by half.

02:03:59.891 --> 02:04:02.429
Too much sugar, I guess.

02:04:04.145 --> 02:04:10.062
I planted bombs on the ship.
There's going to be nothing left of it.

02:04:10.818 --> 02:04:13.060
Why not tell me before?

02:04:29.671 --> 02:04:32.334
Your preparations are impressive.

02:04:33.007 --> 02:04:35.215
Are you with Lupin the 3rd?

02:04:35.593 --> 02:04:40.258
How do you think
I evaded the Shinsengumi for so long?

02:04:43.726 --> 02:04:45.137
Who'd have thought...

02:04:46.521 --> 02:04:49.889
he still carried this with him
after all those years.

02:04:53.695 --> 02:04:55.732
We all came from the same beginnings.

02:04:57.615 --> 02:04:58.731
But...

02:05:00.201 --> 02:05:03.490
it's amazing the gulf
that's grown between us.

02:05:17.885 --> 02:05:21.549
Gintoki, do you have any memory...

02:05:21.889 --> 02:05:23.221
of this book?

02:05:27.729 --> 02:05:30.096
Spilled ramen on mine and chucked it out.

02:06:21.365 --> 02:06:22.822
Sister.

02:06:24.869 --> 02:06:26.656
Welcome...

02:06:44.055 --> 02:06:46.047
Welcome home.

02:06:58.569 --> 02:07:01.687
"In this Amanto-infested city"

02:07:02.365 --> 02:07:06.200
"He roams the Edo streets alone"

02:07:09.330 --> 02:07:12.198
"On the search again"

02:07:12.834 --> 02:07:17.420
"For a place for us to live"

02:07:19.674 --> 02:07:25.466
"Forging through the soulless throng"

02:07:26.556 --> 02:07:30.675
"Like a stray dog"

02:07:30.977 --> 02:07:32.184
"Tonight"

02:07:33.271 --> 02:07:39.609
"He bares his fangs to fight"

02:07:40.903 --> 02:07:42.815
Hey!

02:07:43.447 --> 02:07:45.655
We can't end with this crappy song!

02:10:08.134 --> 02:10:11.878
"No animals were harmed
in the making of this film"

02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:54.629
The dumbest Samurai in the Universe!

02:10:55.097 --> 02:10:56.463
S'up?

02:10:59.602 --> 02:11:01.093
