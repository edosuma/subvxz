00:14.375 --> 00:19.208
A NOT SO MERRY CHRISTMAS

02:40.041 --> 02:41.250
Dad!

02:41.333 --> 02:43.875
Daddy!
Can I change my letter to Santa Claus?

02:43.958 --> 02:46.500
No, you can't. I sent it yesterday.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.833
Please, Dad.

02:47.916 --> 02:50.458
-No.
-I want to change mine too.

02:51.750 --> 02:54.500
Kids, I hope you wished your dad
a happy birthday.

02:55.291 --> 02:57.375
Happy birthday, Dad!

03:00.125 --> 03:01.375
<i>Happy birthday to you…</i>

03:01.416 --> 03:02.958
<i>Why do I hate Christmas?</i>

03:03.041 --> 03:05.041
<i>Because it's also my birthday</i>.

03:05.125 --> 03:06.541
<i>And instead of celebrating me,</i>

03:07.916 --> 03:08.916
<i>I get this.</i>

03:09.000 --> 03:10.500
<i>-Brother.</i>
-Hi, Roberta.

03:10.583 --> 03:12.291
<i>-Can you pick up our parents?</i>
-No car?

03:12.375 --> 03:14.708
<i>-Not right now.</i>
-Sure, I'll get them.

03:14.791 --> 03:17.166
<i>-Hi!</i>
Are you coming with your boyfriend, Ale?

03:17.250 --> 03:18.375
<i>Yes, with Esteban.</i>

03:18.458 --> 03:20.166
<i>-Sit him far from Uncle Miguel.</i>
-Okay.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.333
Yes, I'll take care of it. Thanks, Nuria.

03:22.416 --> 03:23.875
<i>-How old you turning?</i>
-Forty-one.

03:23.958 --> 03:26.708
<i>Don't forget I'm doing keto.</i>
<i>I really need…</i>

03:26.791 --> 03:28.375
-Don't worry.
<i>-Get broccoli for me.</i>

03:28.458 --> 03:30.791
-I'll get you broccoli.
<i>-Thanks, bye.</i>

03:30.875 --> 03:32.166
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, BIRTHDAY BOY!

03:32.250 --> 03:33.625
<i>What's up, bro?</i>

03:33.708 --> 03:35.875
<i>Another trip around the sun.</i>
<i>What do you want?</i>

03:35.958 --> 03:39.125
<i>-Besides what I owe you.</i>
What do I want for my birthday, Rubén?

03:39.625 --> 03:41.583
I want your car off the plot of land.

03:41.666 --> 03:43.375
<i>Relax, I'm working on it.</i>

03:43.458 --> 03:45.041
<i>When your birthday's on Christmas,</i>

03:45.125 --> 03:47.541
<i>people forget about you</i>
<i>or you just get one present.</i>

03:47.625 --> 03:48.500
<i>Not two.</i>

03:49.166 --> 03:51.583
<i>If you say anything,</i>
<i>they call you self-centered.</i>

03:51.666 --> 03:53.125
DECEMBER 24

03:53.208 --> 03:55.166
Daddy, can you help me?

03:55.666 --> 03:56.500
What's up?

03:57.000 --> 04:01.041
My hand hurts from karate.
Help me bandage it.

04:02.250 --> 04:06.583
Now that your dad is here, tell him.
So that you see I'm not overreacting.

04:06.666 --> 04:07.958
What happened?

04:08.041 --> 04:11.750
On the last day of school
I found some headphones,

04:11.833 --> 04:13.916
and there was no name on them.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.500
So I took them,
and now Mom is scolding me.

04:19.125 --> 04:22.000
-Did you erase the name on them?
-There was no name.

04:22.083 --> 04:24.583
Regardless of whether
they had a name or not,

04:24.666 --> 04:26.916
take them to the principal and apologize.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.125
In real life, when you lose something,
nobody returns it to you.

04:30.208 --> 04:32.625
And they definitely don't apologize.
That's life.

04:32.708 --> 04:34.916
Exactly, that's life.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.291
Besides, I've always said,

04:36.791 --> 04:39.708
"Better you than me."

04:39.791 --> 04:42.625
No, that's an awful saying.

04:42.708 --> 04:43.958
-Don't listen to him.
-Why?

04:44.041 --> 04:45.708
When you go back after the holidays,

04:45.791 --> 04:47.750
take back the headphones and apologize.

04:47.833 --> 04:48.875
Discussion over.

04:49.458 --> 04:50.625
Okay, Mom.

04:52.833 --> 04:55.791
And you, Mr. Sayings,
don't you have something to do?

04:56.541 --> 04:57.375
Like what?

04:58.833 --> 05:00.041
Oh, yeah.

05:02.416 --> 05:05.208
-Thanks. It was delicious.
-I'm coming. I want to talk to you.

05:05.291 --> 05:07.166
Get in line.

05:07.750 --> 05:08.583
What did you say?

05:08.666 --> 05:11.750
Nothing.
Don't you think you overreacted in there?

05:11.833 --> 05:14.333
Really? It's fine that they take
other people's things?

05:15.041 --> 05:18.416
No, and I don't want to fight about it,
either. Peace?

05:18.500 --> 05:19.833
I don't know, you tell me.

05:19.916 --> 05:22.250
Well, yeah.
It's a silent night, holy night. No?

05:22.333 --> 05:23.208
Sure.

05:23.875 --> 05:26.500
-What do you need?
-Christmas leftovers with my parents.

05:26.583 --> 05:28.750
-No, thanks.
-Not a surprise.

05:28.833 --> 05:29.916
Did you buy the gifts?

05:30.416 --> 05:32.458
Of course… not.

05:32.541 --> 05:35.166
I need to take out some money
and then I'll get them and…

05:35.666 --> 05:38.041
Nuria wants broccoli.

05:38.125 --> 05:41.083
I already made her food.
So, you'll pick up your parents?

05:41.166 --> 05:43.000
Roberta says she doesn't have a car.

05:43.083 --> 05:44.875
I think she's too lazy to go get them.

05:44.958 --> 05:46.750
-It's not the end of the world.
-Really?

05:46.833 --> 05:48.333
You can battle the traffic, then.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.500
They're not my parents, they're yours.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.541
And it's Christmas and my birthday.

05:54.083 --> 05:55.416
Everyone forgets that.

05:55.500 --> 05:59.166
For your birthday,
you get to go pick up your parents

05:59.250 --> 06:01.416
and a kiss.

06:02.125 --> 06:04.375
Bunny, that's a US fad.

06:04.458 --> 06:06.000
Do you want a kiss or not?

06:11.916 --> 06:12.750
I'm going.

06:13.250 --> 06:14.083
Bye.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.333
-Asshole!
-Goodbye!

06:54.541 --> 06:56.833
-You pass on the right.
-What's with you?

06:56.916 --> 06:58.708
Spare something for Christmas?

06:58.791 --> 07:01.416
-I almost hit you. Be careful.
-Come on.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.333
I don't have any money.

07:03.416 --> 07:06.833
I need to put lights on my roof
so that Santa knows where I live.

07:06.916 --> 07:09.041
Here. It's flat but it'll do the trick.

07:09.125 --> 07:11.000
Take care. Merry Christmas!

07:23.083 --> 07:25.708
Thank you for your purchase, little girl.

07:25.791 --> 07:26.750
Let's go.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.666
-Good morning.
-Hello.

07:32.750 --> 07:35.666
Sorry, traffic is horrible.
You know, fucking Christmas.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.041
Don't say "fucking Christmas."
It sounds terrible.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.208
Fucking Christmas.

07:41.541 --> 07:43.208
I brought you a coffee, Grinch.

07:44.208 --> 07:45.208
Thanks.

07:48.416 --> 07:49.333
It's cold, Conrado.

07:50.416 --> 07:51.791
Have you seen the windows?

07:52.291 --> 07:53.250
Come here.

07:53.333 --> 07:54.166
Look.

07:54.833 --> 07:56.750
They're all dirty, Conrado.

07:56.833 --> 07:58.750
Take a look. You have to clean them.

07:58.833 --> 08:02.166
I can't clean the windows.
My back hurts. I need surgery.

08:02.250 --> 08:03.250
When?

08:03.875 --> 08:07.208
I mean, I'm going to need surgery
if I keep cleaning the windows.

08:08.583 --> 08:11.333
-Nice try.
-It really does hurt.

08:11.416 --> 08:14.333
-We need to hire someone to do it.
-No, Conrado.

08:14.416 --> 08:15.583
What did we agree to?

08:16.083 --> 08:18.458
We need to sell more and spend less.

08:18.541 --> 08:21.583
What do you think will happen
if we hire a cleaner?

08:22.666 --> 08:24.041
The windows will be clean.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.625
No! We'll spend more.

08:25.708 --> 08:27.625
Speaking of expenses, I need money.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.541
No, speaking of expenses,

08:29.625 --> 08:33.208
I wanted to talk to you about this relic.

08:33.291 --> 08:34.708
-I need a Mac.
-Yeah.

08:34.791 --> 08:37.625
I can't work,
I don't know how to use a PC.

08:37.708 --> 08:40.500
It's not good for designing.
I'm not sure if it's Windows…

08:40.583 --> 08:42.958
Maybe it's me? I'm just stupid.

08:43.041 --> 08:45.833
-I can't…
-Enough, Conrado. Calm down.

08:45.916 --> 08:46.791
Take a breath.

08:48.166 --> 08:49.083
That's it.

08:49.166 --> 08:51.708
Don't worry.
If we sell Lorena Ochoa's driver,

08:52.208 --> 08:53.416
I'll buy a new computer.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.458
-We'll never sell that.
-Have some faith.

08:55.541 --> 08:56.750
-Hold on, come here.
-What?

08:59.833 --> 09:01.416
-What's this?
-Happy birthday.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.750
Is that for me?

09:02.833 --> 09:03.666
Of course!

09:03.750 --> 09:05.750
You shouldn't have, Conrado.

09:05.833 --> 09:09.000
It measures your steps, your calories…

09:09.083 --> 09:10.958
It even prevents heart attacks.

09:11.041 --> 09:13.708
-Like Dick Tracy, remember?
-Does it tell time?

09:14.416 --> 09:15.833
Yes, of course.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.416
What?

09:21.416 --> 09:22.791
-No.
-Birthday hug?

09:22.875 --> 09:24.125
-No.
-Come here.

09:24.208 --> 09:27.291
-No.
-Yes.

09:27.375 --> 09:28.750
-No.
-Chuy.

09:32.666 --> 09:35.958
Okay, enough. Let go of me, Conrado.

09:36.041 --> 09:37.541
Enough.

09:37.625 --> 09:39.125
All right, see you later.

09:39.208 --> 09:41.541
I have to buy presents
for my kids and family.

09:42.041 --> 09:44.166
-You know, fucking Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.666
The windows, Conrado!

09:49.791 --> 09:50.833
TOYS

09:57.125 --> 09:58.250
I'll get a teddy bear.

10:02.458 --> 10:03.875
"Housewife."

10:04.958 --> 10:06.625
On sale. Let's go!

10:15.625 --> 10:17.083
This is what Óscar wants?

10:17.708 --> 10:18.666
That's weird.

10:22.375 --> 10:23.541
This is for me.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.958
SOLD OUT

10:26.041 --> 10:27.250
He'll love this.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.083
Come here, sweetie.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.125
What's up?

10:35.666 --> 10:37.583
I think I finished my vision board.

10:37.666 --> 10:38.833
Your vision what?

10:38.916 --> 10:40.000
My vision board.

10:40.666 --> 10:41.500
It's nice.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.583
I want to focus
on having a wonderful family.

10:44.666 --> 10:47.083
Everything else will fall into place.

10:47.166 --> 10:48.000
What?

10:48.083 --> 10:49.666
We do have a wonderful family.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.416
Yes, we do.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.208
But I wonder
if we're doing everything right.

10:54.291 --> 10:56.250
Yes, dear. We're doing great.

10:57.833 --> 10:58.666
Come.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.208
-What?
-Then, comes this.

11:01.708 --> 11:02.541
What is it?

11:03.750 --> 11:04.875
The salon.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.083
The dog salon?

11:08.166 --> 11:09.166
Yeah.

11:09.833 --> 11:12.375
My dear,

11:13.083 --> 11:16.791
I don't think you can be a housewife
and a businesswoman.

11:16.875 --> 11:18.833
It gets complicated.

11:18.916 --> 11:22.833
That's the most sexist thing
you've ever said to me.

11:22.916 --> 11:26.583
You see me as a mom.
Why can't I be a mom and a businesswoman?

11:26.666 --> 11:28.875
Don't get me wrong.

11:29.541 --> 11:32.458
I would support you,
but we don't have the money right now.

11:32.541 --> 11:34.166
I'm not asking you for money.

11:34.666 --> 11:37.000
There are angel investors.

11:37.083 --> 11:38.875
You show them a business model,

11:38.958 --> 11:41.291
they believe in you,
invest and you move it forward.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.916
That's one option. There's also the land.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.916
If we sell it, we'd have some money
and I could support you then.

11:47.666 --> 11:50.208
-Hello. Yes, I'm on my way.
<i>-Where are you, son?</i>

11:50.875 --> 11:55.750
Bye. Yes, Mom.
I'm going down the stairs right now.

11:55.833 --> 11:58.375
Turn signals aren't just for decoration!
You animal!

11:58.458 --> 12:00.791
Calm down, Mom. I'll cause an accident.

12:00.875 --> 12:02.333
You're a savage.

12:02.416 --> 12:07.583
I can't stand Nuria. She's so rude.

12:07.666 --> 12:09.291
-You raised her.
-Come on.

12:09.375 --> 12:12.458
-And where were you?
-I was bringing home the bacon.

12:12.541 --> 12:16.041
Sorry to interrupt, but aren't you going
to wish me a happy birthday?

12:16.125 --> 12:20.208
-Yes! Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday, son.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.166
-Are you blind, idiot?!
-Dad.

12:24.250 --> 12:26.625
-Stupid!
-You pulled my seatbelt.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.875
You almost strangled me, Dad!

12:30.958 --> 12:32.500
Calm down, son!

12:32.583 --> 12:34.333
I don't care that it's Christmas.

12:34.416 --> 12:37.041
-Sisters!
-Merry Christmas, Chuy.

12:37.125 --> 12:41.583
-What a great night.
-Hello. How are you?

12:41.666 --> 12:43.541
We were just waiting for you.

12:43.625 --> 12:45.333
-Great.
-When are you going to Tulum?

12:45.416 --> 12:46.791
Tomorrow. Can you believe it?

12:46.875 --> 12:48.708
-No.
-Aren't you going to visit me?

12:48.791 --> 12:51.208
-No way. I don't want to get dengue.
-Idiot.

12:51.291 --> 12:52.875
-That's not true.
-Hey, Nuria.

12:52.958 --> 12:55.875
-What's up?
-What've you been doing? You look divine.

12:55.958 --> 12:58.041
-Come on, don't even start.
-What?

12:58.125 --> 13:00.250
-You look gorgeous.
-I know.

13:00.333 --> 13:03.000
-Come in.
-Happy birthday, brother.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.125
-Thanks.
-That's right! Happy birthday!

13:05.208 --> 13:06.125
"That's right."

13:07.666 --> 13:10.500
-Auntie! Uncle!
-Merry Christmas!

13:10.583 --> 13:11.541
Yes, Auntie.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.458
Take good care of my Tupperware.

13:13.541 --> 13:15.583
You lose one every year.

13:15.666 --> 13:17.208
Sure, don't worry.

13:17.291 --> 13:19.000
What, Jesús?

13:19.916 --> 13:21.625
Happy birthday, my dear!

13:21.708 --> 13:24.416
-Thank you.
-My dear.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.833
Thanks for remembering it all on your own.

13:26.916 --> 13:28.333
-My boy!
-Uncle.

13:29.166 --> 13:30.666
I want a big rum and Coke.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.458
-This big.
-This big.

13:32.541 --> 13:33.666
Come in.

13:33.750 --> 13:36.166
-Hey!
-Sister, come in.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.250
And…?

13:38.083 --> 13:39.041
-Chuy.
-What?

13:39.125 --> 13:41.083
I told you this morning. Esteban.

13:42.875 --> 13:44.333
Hey, champ. Can I park there?

13:44.416 --> 13:46.291
No, that's not a good spot.

13:46.375 --> 13:48.458
Thanks, bro. You're the man.

13:50.083 --> 13:51.875
-Hold on.
-What?

13:52.375 --> 13:53.291
Who's that guy?

13:53.916 --> 13:57.541
Ban. Esteban.

13:58.166 --> 14:00.083
That idiot Ramiro cheated on me.

14:00.791 --> 14:01.791
Ramiro who?

14:02.916 --> 14:03.916
What?

14:04.791 --> 14:06.375
I was with him for eight years!

14:07.166 --> 14:09.291
Right, that Ramiro.

14:09.375 --> 14:11.500
-That Ramiro.
-Yes.

14:12.166 --> 14:14.458
-What's up, bro?
-Damn.

14:14.541 --> 14:16.458
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks, come in.

14:16.541 --> 14:18.333
Yeah, thanks so much. Come in.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.958
Merry Christmas.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.208
Four fingers.

14:27.291 --> 14:30.166
I'm going to give him less.
He gets inappropriate.

14:30.250 --> 14:31.291
That's enough.

14:31.375 --> 14:34.333
Too much blah-blah
and not enough glug-glug.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.125
Don't go too crazy, Uncle.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.916
No, this is it.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.666
I gave up drinking…

14:39.750 --> 14:40.791
What?

14:40.875 --> 14:43.375
-That's great.
-…but it didn't give me up!

14:45.625 --> 14:46.541
Cheers.

14:48.791 --> 14:51.000
Help me get some chairs, Uncle.

14:51.083 --> 14:53.083
No way, man. I don't think so.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.500
Every year you put me to work.

14:55.583 --> 14:57.625
This year I'm here as a guest.

14:57.708 --> 14:59.625
Fine. Help me, brother.

15:00.291 --> 15:01.541
Come on. Don't make faces.

15:01.625 --> 15:02.500
Go on.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.750
Over here. Take this.

15:08.125 --> 15:12.541
Dude, if your shoes are dirty,
take them off before entering the house.

15:12.625 --> 15:15.583
-Sorry, I'll take them off now.
-I can't believe it.

15:15.666 --> 15:18.916
Tell me, how's college going?

15:19.541 --> 15:20.458
Good.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.291
And your new apartment?

15:22.875 --> 15:24.541
Good, it's cool. It's chill.

15:25.166 --> 15:26.958
I bet the power's been cut off already.

15:27.666 --> 15:28.791
Yeah.

15:28.875 --> 15:29.750
Once.

15:29.833 --> 15:32.291
It's hard living alone.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.416
But you're an adult now.

15:34.958 --> 15:38.541
You can't live with our parents anymore.
Or on the land, either.

15:39.666 --> 15:41.083
Of course not.

15:41.791 --> 15:42.958
No.

15:45.291 --> 15:47.250
-I was going to tell you…
-What?

15:47.791 --> 15:51.583
I need to buy some extra books for school.

15:52.208 --> 15:54.875
I'm short a few pesos.
I was hoping you could help out.

15:54.958 --> 15:57.083
Yeah, right.

16:00.041 --> 16:02.500
Seriously, how'd your shoes get so dirty?

16:03.125 --> 16:04.791
-I think I stepped in poop.
-What?

16:04.875 --> 16:06.166
Take them off!

16:06.875 --> 16:07.916
Bro!

16:12.500 --> 16:13.333
Come on, sweetie.

16:15.458 --> 16:16.291
No!

16:17.083 --> 16:18.833
-Who's next? Come on, Uncle.
-Me!

16:18.916 --> 16:22.291
-But I need my medicine.
-Leave the drink, Uncle.

16:22.375 --> 16:23.583
I'm going.

16:23.666 --> 16:25.541
-Let's see.
-Gently.

16:29.208 --> 16:30.625
I'm taking this one.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.583
You're good at stealing.

16:32.666 --> 16:34.541
-My turn. Here I go.
-Go, dear.

16:36.208 --> 16:37.208
Double four!

16:39.125 --> 16:40.333
A steal!

16:40.416 --> 16:41.666
I don't have anything.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.083
Let's see!

16:43.750 --> 16:45.125
I want the envelope.

16:45.750 --> 16:47.791
Yes, sister.

16:47.875 --> 16:52.666
-Why?
-'Cause there's money in here. Right, Dad?

16:52.750 --> 16:54.791
Does everyone have a gift?
Let's open them.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.708
Mom, Sandy doesn't have anything.

16:56.791 --> 16:58.208
You don't have a present?

16:59.250 --> 17:01.208
Your godfather has some,
he'll give you one.

17:01.291 --> 17:04.500
What? No.
Sandy needs to learn how to play.

17:04.583 --> 17:06.375
-Hey!
-Chuy.

17:06.458 --> 17:09.666
I'm just joking.
Come here and pick, Sandy.

17:11.708 --> 17:12.958
Actually, I'll choose.

17:13.041 --> 17:15.083
I'll give you this little box.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.333
-Okay.
-Oh, Chuy.

17:16.416 --> 17:17.250
Thanks.

17:17.333 --> 17:20.041
Because my little envelope has money.

17:23.833 --> 17:25.708
Look, sister, it's amazing.

17:25.791 --> 17:27.541
It is very cool!

17:28.625 --> 17:31.416
What a great gift! It's a mini fridge.

17:32.875 --> 17:35.666
-Come on, son. Open your gift.
-What, Mom?

17:35.750 --> 17:39.625
-Open it!
-Open it!

17:39.708 --> 17:42.416
I'll open it, but I'm not sharing.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.166
-Share it.
-Open it, dear.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.458
-What is it?
-What is it?

17:47.541 --> 17:48.875
-Mom!
-What is it?

17:48.958 --> 17:51.208
Merry Christmas, honey. Really.

17:52.666 --> 17:54.250
I love that picture.

17:54.333 --> 17:58.000
Give your mom a kiss and a hug.
Come on. Don't be like that.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.416
-Come here, Mom.
-My son.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.916
-I'm glad you liked it.
-Thanks, Mom.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.041
Should we go to the dining room?

18:06.125 --> 18:07.500
Time to eat.

18:07.583 --> 18:10.125
-Yeah.
-Take that hat off at the table.

18:20.250 --> 18:22.000
Let's toast.

18:22.083 --> 18:23.625
No, we're going to pray.

18:24.750 --> 18:25.791
No, Dad.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.666
Let's pray.

18:30.375 --> 18:35.708
Blessed be the Lord,
to provide us with nourishment.

18:35.791 --> 18:37.958
Like my wife's turkey,

18:38.041 --> 18:40.000
that you bring
from the country to the city.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.541
Shut up!

18:44.375 --> 18:46.916
You give us everything we need,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.416
like minerals and vitamins.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.958
And you give us strength,

18:53.291 --> 18:54.500
zest,

18:54.583 --> 18:55.500
energy,

18:56.333 --> 18:57.666
all the strength

18:58.166 --> 19:02.208
to live in this world
and be able to be all together.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.791
-The turkey!
-The turkey!

19:04.875 --> 19:10.666
-What turkey? Amen!
-Yeah, amen!

19:11.541 --> 19:13.208
The cheese!

19:13.291 --> 19:15.333
-It looks great.
-Make room for the cheese.

19:15.416 --> 19:17.250
Who looks great? Nuria?

19:17.333 --> 19:19.458
-Divine.
-Thanks, Chuy.

19:20.166 --> 19:21.791
What diet was it you're doing?

19:21.875 --> 19:23.625
I told you it's called keto.

19:23.708 --> 19:25.541
Keto, chubster?

19:25.625 --> 19:27.583
Never call me "chubster" again, old grump.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.166
-What's wrong with that?
-Son!

19:29.250 --> 19:31.041
Don't talk to your sister like that.

19:31.125 --> 19:33.083
Everyone is so sensitive.

19:33.166 --> 19:34.416
Pass the salad.

19:36.833 --> 19:38.958
Why are you going to Tulum, Roberta?

19:39.041 --> 19:40.583
To make money. How's that?

19:41.708 --> 19:42.958
That's it.

19:43.041 --> 19:44.875
-Thanks, Mom.
-That's the right attitude.

19:44.958 --> 19:46.291
Thanks, Uncle. Can you pass…

19:48.875 --> 19:50.250
Ale.

19:50.833 --> 19:52.291
How long have you been together?

19:52.375 --> 19:55.333
That doesn't matter.
What matters is how long we'll last.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.958
That's right. Cheers to love!

19:59.041 --> 20:01.083
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

20:01.166 --> 20:05.916
Silvia! Your cheese sauce
keeps getting better every year.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.375
-Thank you.
-Don't lie. You haven't even tried it.

20:10.291 --> 20:11.208
Enough.

20:11.291 --> 20:14.041
Stop being hypocrites.
Who likes the cheese sauce?

20:14.125 --> 20:15.083
-I do!
-Me!

20:15.666 --> 20:16.625
You don't like it?

20:16.708 --> 20:19.291
No, not since we were little.

20:19.375 --> 20:20.625
I don't believe that.

20:20.708 --> 20:23.000
Look, Esteban is making faces.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.500
Do you like the cheese sauce?

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
He loves it. Esteban loves it.

20:27.083 --> 20:27.916
Delicious.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
A people-pleaser.

20:29.791 --> 20:32.541
"Delicious"? Come on. Sure, Chuy is crazy.

20:32.625 --> 20:35.916
I'm not going to change my recipe
at this point.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.708
Besides, this year is my last year.

20:38.791 --> 20:41.125
-Mom!
-Silvia, no.

20:41.208 --> 20:42.291
Please!

20:42.375 --> 20:45.458
You always say it's your last year
and it never is.

20:46.166 --> 20:49.166
Get me another drink.
You know how I like it. Four fingers.

20:49.250 --> 20:51.291
-Maybe 20?
-Enough, Uncle.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.791
Get some help.

20:54.625 --> 20:57.500
I told you to take off your dirty shoes.

20:58.375 --> 21:00.750
-I will.
-Did you get your car off the land?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.833
-Can you pass the potatoes?
-Dad.

21:06.916 --> 21:09.416
-What do you want?
-What do you mean?

21:09.500 --> 21:11.666
-Drop it.
-Do you know something I don't?

21:11.750 --> 21:12.583
Do you want cod?

21:12.666 --> 21:15.416
Why are you all acting like this?

21:15.500 --> 21:16.708
No.

21:16.791 --> 21:19.708
You know something, Uncle.
You're laughing.

21:19.791 --> 21:21.166
-What?
-Look, man.

21:22.166 --> 21:23.041
Don't get mad.

21:26.708 --> 21:28.500
-I'm living on the land.
-What?

21:29.208 --> 21:31.833
You're camping on our parents' plot?

21:32.958 --> 21:33.791
What do you mean…?

21:34.416 --> 21:36.500
So you're camping on the land.

21:36.583 --> 21:37.666
-Pass me…
-Dad.

21:37.750 --> 21:39.375
-What?
-What do you mean "what"?

21:39.458 --> 21:41.583
What do you want me to do?
He's unemployed!

21:41.666 --> 21:43.500
When has this lazy bum had a job?

21:43.583 --> 21:46.708
What do you want me to do?
Have him live with us?

21:46.791 --> 21:48.000
What about our intimacy?

21:48.083 --> 21:49.458
There are guests present.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.166
Now you'll never get rid of him.

21:51.916 --> 21:53.416
Bro, it's Christmas.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.500
Exactly, it's Christmas.

21:56.166 --> 21:57.833
Know why I hate Christmas?

21:57.916 --> 22:00.791
Because for me,
Christmas is for the mooches,

22:00.875 --> 22:04.666
for the parasites,
the handouts, and for who else?

22:04.750 --> 22:06.208
For all of you.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.583
Chuy, go. Chuy, bring. Chuy, buy.

22:08.666 --> 22:12.125
Of course,
"We already gave him his birthday cake."

22:12.208 --> 22:14.791
-You know what? Christmas Eve is over.
-Wow.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.083
My birthday is over.

22:16.833 --> 22:18.041
Chuy is over.

22:18.125 --> 22:20.916
-No, son.
-Chuy.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.750
<i>Happy birthday…</i>

22:23.875 --> 22:24.875
Not happy.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.083
That's embarrassing.

22:28.875 --> 22:30.625
Pass me the prawns.

22:36.500 --> 22:39.083
-He's been having a rough few weeks.
-Don't worry.

22:40.791 --> 22:43.500
You are a saint. How brutal.

22:43.583 --> 22:44.958
-Merry Christmas.
-Bye.

22:45.583 --> 22:46.583
-Goodbye.
-See you.

22:46.666 --> 22:47.791
-Pleasure.
-Likewise.

22:47.875 --> 22:50.166
-Bye, Dani. Get some rest.
-Thanks.

22:50.250 --> 22:51.875
They're not that weird, Sofi.

22:52.375 --> 22:53.208
Who is Sofi?

22:53.875 --> 22:56.333
No, Esteban!
Don't grab my hand! Who is Sofi?

23:07.541 --> 23:08.666
Good evening.

23:09.541 --> 23:10.416
Merry Christmas.

23:10.916 --> 23:12.666
Merry Christmas? No.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.625
-Double tequila, please.
-Sure.

23:25.208 --> 23:26.708
I want Dad to come home.

23:27.791 --> 23:30.500
Your dad went to talk to Santa.

23:31.541 --> 23:33.000
I wanted him to be here.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.000
Me too.

23:42.125 --> 23:43.166
Me too.

23:43.833 --> 23:44.916
All good, Jesús?

23:45.000 --> 23:46.291
How do you know my name?

23:46.375 --> 23:48.833
I know a lot of things about you.

23:49.375 --> 23:51.625
Such as, today is your birthday.

23:51.708 --> 23:54.333
Hold on. How do you know that?

23:54.416 --> 23:56.625
-Let's say…
-No "let's say."

23:56.708 --> 23:58.000
How do you know?

23:58.083 --> 24:00.041
You know that song about Santa

24:00.125 --> 24:03.791
where he makes a list
of who is naughty and nice?

24:03.875 --> 24:04.708
Yeah.

24:04.791 --> 24:08.291
They send me to deal
with the super naughty ones.

24:10.625 --> 24:12.000
Okay, now I get it.

24:12.666 --> 24:16.250
-You're part of a religious sect.
-No, I'm not part of a religious sect.

24:16.333 --> 24:18.625
I'm your diva godmother.

24:18.708 --> 24:20.916
There's no such thing.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.250
They're fairy godmothers.

24:22.333 --> 24:23.666
Of course we exist.

24:23.750 --> 24:27.041
By the way,
thanks for the flat soda you gave me.

24:27.125 --> 24:28.916
You're thinking of someone else.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.208
Didn't you give me
a flat soda this morning?

24:31.291 --> 24:35.416
-I gave some beggar a donation.
-You call that "a donation"?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.125
I had nothing else.

24:37.208 --> 24:39.750
If that's all you have to give,

24:39.833 --> 24:41.166
it's not a lot, right?

24:41.250 --> 24:42.208
What do you want?

24:42.291 --> 24:44.458
I want you to stop suffering.

24:44.541 --> 24:46.916
I knew you were part of the church.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.083
No, I'm not,
but I want you to stop suffering.

24:50.166 --> 24:51.208
I'm not suffering.

24:51.291 --> 24:52.208
-Really?
-No.

24:52.291 --> 24:55.375
Why aren't you celebrating Christmas
with your family?

24:55.458 --> 24:56.916
I hate Christmas. So what?

24:57.000 --> 25:01.041
Christmas has a way
of making us see things.

25:01.125 --> 25:04.083
No, wait. You don't understand how hard--

25:04.166 --> 25:07.625
What you don't understand
is what's behind Christmas.

25:07.708 --> 25:09.166
What do you want me to learn?

25:09.250 --> 25:10.250
To be vegan?

25:10.750 --> 25:12.625
To cook with cheese sauce?

25:12.708 --> 25:15.083
You have to learn
that the world keeps spinning

25:15.166 --> 25:18.750
despite your problems,
your opinions, and your birthday, Chuy.

25:18.833 --> 25:20.333
If you don't think you're lost,

25:20.416 --> 25:23.291
I'll make you relive Christmas
until you learn.

25:23.375 --> 25:25.000
All right, sure. I'm really lost.

25:25.083 --> 25:26.083
Give me more tequila.

25:26.166 --> 25:28.458
You have to see the magic, Chuy.

25:28.541 --> 25:30.208
All right, show me your magic.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.791
Live and relive a white Christmas,

25:33.875 --> 25:35.916
by sea and sand,

25:36.000 --> 25:38.041
in the sky and the stars,

25:38.125 --> 25:41.208
may they all fill you with light.

25:41.291 --> 25:42.458
If you don't succeed,

25:42.541 --> 25:45.291
you must do it over and over again.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.333
Abracadabra! Poof!

25:50.041 --> 25:51.416
Give me a break.

26:34.125 --> 26:35.375
Dad?

26:36.375 --> 26:38.375
I want to change my letter to Santa.

26:38.458 --> 26:42.000
No, son. You get what you get.

26:42.708 --> 26:46.166
He hasn't brought me anything yet,
so we can still change it.

26:46.666 --> 26:48.250
What do you mean?

26:48.333 --> 26:50.166
Not since last year.

26:50.750 --> 26:56.208
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

26:56.291 --> 26:59.625
<i>Happy birthday to you…</i>

26:59.708 --> 27:01.000
Why the cake?

27:01.083 --> 27:04.500
I want to apologize
for my awful behavior yesterday.

27:04.583 --> 27:05.750
Yesterday?

27:05.833 --> 27:07.375
I don't recall you fighting.

27:09.208 --> 27:11.375
He fought with the waiter yesterday.

27:12.166 --> 27:13.666
-With the waiter?
-Yes.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.541
My brother is calling.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.166
-Let me see what he wants.
-Chuy.

27:17.833 --> 27:19.875
<i>Good morning!</i>

27:19.958 --> 27:22.958
-What's up, bro? Why are you calling?
<i>-Because it's your birthday.</i>

27:23.041 --> 27:26.458
-What? No, yesterday was my birthday!
<i>-Do you want an agenda?</i>

27:26.541 --> 27:28.750
Hold on. I'm getting another call.

27:29.416 --> 27:30.750
<i>Birthday boy.</i>

27:30.833 --> 27:33.666
-What do you want, Bobby?
<i>-Can you pick up Mom and Dad?</i>

27:33.750 --> 27:34.708
No!

27:34.791 --> 27:37.875
-I picked up our parents yesterday.
<i>-What are you talking about?</i>

27:37.958 --> 27:39.458
-What?
<i>-I need to--</i>

27:40.791 --> 27:41.625
No.

27:42.125 --> 27:43.333
This is impossible.

27:44.333 --> 27:45.583
This can't be happening.

27:46.125 --> 27:47.125
No.

27:47.208 --> 27:50.333
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, BIRTHDAY BOY!

27:53.583 --> 27:56.750
THE NEXT YEAR…

27:56.833 --> 27:59.291
-It looks nice here.
-Dad! Look at my vision board!

27:59.375 --> 28:00.875
Come here, Bunny.

28:00.958 --> 28:01.875
What's wrong?

28:01.958 --> 28:04.041
I don't believe what's happening to me.

28:04.125 --> 28:05.416
What's wrong?

28:05.500 --> 28:07.333
-Bunny, come.
-What?

28:07.416 --> 28:08.375
That's so cool.

28:09.541 --> 28:11.291
I think I'm under a spell.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.208
-Like voodoo?
-What?

28:14.291 --> 28:18.208
-Shall we do a cleanse? Are you okay?
-Don't joke around, please.

28:18.291 --> 28:21.708
Yesterday a bartender dressed like
a fairy godmother did something to me.

28:21.791 --> 28:22.875
Like a spell.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.708
-What?
-Yeah.

28:24.791 --> 28:27.458
I'm reliving what happened yesterday.
Do you get it?

28:27.541 --> 28:29.166
No, you're not making much sense.

28:29.250 --> 28:32.458
Yesterday was Christmas Eve
and today is Christmas Eve.

28:32.541 --> 28:35.750
And it's always your birthday.
Please don't play the martyr this year.

28:35.833 --> 28:38.041
I'm not playing the martyr.
I'm being serious.

28:38.125 --> 28:40.166
I have a few pending issues with you.

28:40.250 --> 28:45.458
My parents invited you for leftovers.
Even if you never go, you're invited.

28:45.541 --> 28:47.458
See! No leftovers!

28:47.541 --> 28:48.791
-Your dad hates me.
-Dad!

28:48.875 --> 28:50.291
-You know…
-My parents never…

28:50.375 --> 28:53.208
-What? Not right now.
-Dad!

28:53.291 --> 28:55.041
Please, help me.

28:55.125 --> 28:57.583
No. I already have two kids.
I don't want a third.

28:57.666 --> 28:59.583
As for your birthday, go to therapy.

28:59.666 --> 29:03.250
Exactly! Yesterday was my birthday.
Today is my birthday.

29:03.333 --> 29:06.666
And she… he…

29:07.666 --> 29:09.791
A fairy godfather cast a spell on me.

29:09.875 --> 29:10.916
-Dad?
-What?

29:11.000 --> 29:12.416
-Look.
-Yeah, so cool.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.208
-Very cool.
-Chuy.

29:14.291 --> 29:17.666
Fine. It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.916
It's spectacular. It's incredible.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.208
So many colors. It's incredible.

29:23.291 --> 29:24.416
There. What?

29:26.458 --> 29:28.166
Fine. I don't feel good.

29:28.791 --> 29:30.916
I'm sorry, kid.

29:31.000 --> 29:31.916
I'm sorry, Bunny.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.083
I'm going to the pharmacy
and I'll see you later.

29:35.166 --> 29:38.083
Yes, go do that.
Don't forget the presents.

29:38.166 --> 29:39.041
Look.

29:39.791 --> 29:40.666
I love it.

29:44.791 --> 29:46.541
STAND-UP
DIVA GODMOTHER

29:46.625 --> 29:47.916
You!

29:48.000 --> 29:50.458
No, come here! I was looking for you.

29:51.791 --> 29:54.166
I know, dear. Everyone is looking for me.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.333
What did you do to me? Undo this!

29:56.416 --> 29:59.083
Chuy, only you can help yourself.

29:59.166 --> 30:01.125
Undo your spell.

30:01.208 --> 30:03.208
Take it down a notch!

30:03.291 --> 30:07.000
All you have to do is enjoy Christmas.

30:07.916 --> 30:11.708
And lose the long face you always have.

30:11.791 --> 30:12.833
-What face?
-That one.

30:12.916 --> 30:14.041
-Which one?
-That one.

30:14.791 --> 30:17.125
Relax your jaw. I want you to smile.

30:17.208 --> 30:18.291
Enjoy.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.125
Try another one. No.

30:21.333 --> 30:22.666
Another one.

30:22.750 --> 30:24.000
No, still long face.

30:25.708 --> 30:26.958
-No.
-Now?

30:27.041 --> 30:29.083
-You're not convincing me.
-Enough!

30:29.166 --> 30:30.875
So losing the long face will fix it?

30:30.958 --> 30:32.916
Yes, just like that.

30:33.416 --> 30:38.333
Well, and a few small things
you have to do after dinner.

30:38.416 --> 30:41.375
-You're kidding, right?
-Not at all.

30:41.458 --> 30:42.416
Look, Chuy.

30:43.791 --> 30:45.625
You have to follow this

30:45.708 --> 30:48.750
to the letter… letter… letter…

30:48.833 --> 30:50.500
Why are you talking like that?

30:50.583 --> 30:54.208
Fine. Follow this to the letter.
That's all.

30:54.291 --> 30:55.250
And it's done?

30:55.333 --> 30:57.041
-That's it.
-Are you sure?

30:57.125 --> 31:00.125
I'm completely sure that will remove it.

31:02.500 --> 31:03.791
Go on, Chuy. Take care.

31:08.833 --> 31:09.833
What's up?

31:10.500 --> 31:12.500
Aren't you going to wish me
a happy birthday?

31:15.458 --> 31:16.750
Happy birthday, man.

31:20.958 --> 31:22.083
No present?

31:22.833 --> 31:26.041
I gave you a watch last year
that you never wore.

31:29.583 --> 31:30.416
Are you okay?

31:31.833 --> 31:33.291
I'm living in a nightmare.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.125
Drink some Coke.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.166
Some Coke, sure.

31:41.666 --> 31:43.125
What do have I to do now?

31:44.750 --> 31:46.708
<i>For now just get rid of the long face.</i>

31:46.791 --> 31:48.750
<i>And we'll see after dinner.</i>

31:48.833 --> 31:49.875
Okay.

31:49.958 --> 31:52.166
<i>And don't forget to get your parents.</i>

31:55.208 --> 31:57.250
Choose a lane, you nut!

31:57.333 --> 31:59.500
-Mom, he was fine.
-No, he wasn't.

31:59.583 --> 32:01.666
He was cutting you off.

32:01.750 --> 32:03.916
You're a savage. Leave him alone.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.416
You've had five accidents.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.083
You've had six, Néstor.

32:08.375 --> 32:11.208
I can't stand Roberta.

32:11.291 --> 32:13.375
-She's so rude.
-You raised her.

32:13.458 --> 32:15.458
Really? And where were you?

32:15.541 --> 32:17.916
I was bringing home the bacon.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.791
Come on, Mom. This year it's Roberta.
Last year it was Nuria.

32:21.291 --> 32:22.375
That's not true.

32:22.458 --> 32:24.416
I remember it like it was yesterday.

32:24.500 --> 32:27.541
Don't spread lies about me.

32:28.166 --> 32:30.541
Since I can't keep a happy face with you,

32:30.625 --> 32:32.791
someone else will pick you up next time.

32:33.458 --> 32:34.416
Not me anymore.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.333
Watch where you're going, man!

32:36.416 --> 32:37.333
Dad!

32:39.666 --> 32:43.375
-Auntie! Uncle! Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas!

32:43.458 --> 32:47.750
I didn't bring any Tupperware this time
because you always lose them.

32:47.833 --> 32:49.416
Okay, sure.

32:49.500 --> 32:50.375
Miguel.

32:54.125 --> 32:58.250
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks, Uncle. You remembered.

32:58.333 --> 33:02.833
-Happy birthday, my boy.
-Thanks, Auntie.

33:04.166 --> 33:07.166
-Hey!
-Ale and…

33:07.250 --> 33:08.083
This is Pablito.

33:08.166 --> 33:10.041
-Pablito?
-Hello.

33:10.125 --> 33:11.375
Pablito is a pet name.

33:11.458 --> 33:14.666
Sure. Thanks. How nice, Pablito.

33:15.208 --> 33:16.083
Come in.

33:16.750 --> 33:18.125
-Hold on.
-What?

33:18.208 --> 33:20.458
-Who's that?
-Pablo.

33:20.541 --> 33:22.583
You bring a different guy every Christmas.

33:22.666 --> 33:24.791
And you always have the same long face.

33:24.875 --> 33:25.750
What?

33:26.250 --> 33:27.500
Happy birthday!

33:28.333 --> 33:29.666
Son of a…

33:29.750 --> 33:31.583
Jerk.

33:31.666 --> 33:33.291
-How are you?
-Good, come in.

33:33.375 --> 33:35.708
-Happy birthday, brother.
-Come in. Yeah.

33:35.791 --> 33:36.916
-Come in.
-Need help?

33:37.000 --> 33:40.041
No, I'm fine. The cold helps.

33:47.041 --> 33:50.791
-Do you have a lighter?
-You're going to stink up the house.

33:50.875 --> 33:54.541
Since I quit drinking,
I started smoking heavily.

33:54.625 --> 33:56.083
Well, tough.

33:56.833 --> 33:59.000
I also gave up drinking…

33:59.083 --> 33:59.916
What?

34:00.416 --> 34:02.000
…but it didn't give me up.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.083
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

34:09.125 --> 34:11.500
I wish Uncle Miguel
would start drinking again.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.875
He's unbearable since he joined AA.

34:13.958 --> 34:16.041
-Don't be like that.
-Let's make him drink.

34:16.125 --> 34:17.833
-What?
-I'm joking.

34:18.833 --> 34:20.083
What's going on with you?

34:20.166 --> 34:21.750
How's living on the land?

34:22.833 --> 34:24.250
I'm not living there anymore.

34:24.333 --> 34:25.208
Really?

34:25.291 --> 34:26.541
-No.
-That's great.

34:27.333 --> 34:29.416
I'm using it for business.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.291
-What business?
-Paintball.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.333
They don't tell you anything.

34:33.958 --> 34:35.916
You should come by.
I'll give you 50 balls.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.083
I mean you can have them for free.
I won't shoot you.

34:39.166 --> 34:40.041
Sure.

34:40.958 --> 34:44.875
By the way, I need you to sign something.

34:44.958 --> 34:49.000
Since you're the legal representative,
I need to do some paperwork.

34:49.625 --> 34:52.708
Aren't there more meaningful things
you could do with the land?

34:52.791 --> 34:54.958
More meaningful for whom?

34:56.041 --> 34:57.541
For you,

34:57.625 --> 34:59.583
or for me?

34:59.666 --> 35:02.083
-We're going to start the game.
-Come on.

35:06.666 --> 35:09.333
It's gorgeous, I love it.

35:09.416 --> 35:10.791
-Look.
-What is this?

35:10.875 --> 35:11.916
It's for my hair.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.166
-What's this…
-It's a cube to…

35:14.250 --> 35:15.208
A salt shaker?

35:16.041 --> 35:19.083
It's a game.
You make color combinations with it.

35:19.166 --> 35:20.958
-A game? For me?
-I love it, thanks.

35:21.041 --> 35:22.916
A bit generic, but thanks.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.708
You need to.

35:24.791 --> 35:26.458
-Do you want to trade?
-Yes.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.125
Okay.

35:29.875 --> 35:31.500
Is it hot?

35:33.291 --> 35:35.041
What's in it? Can I…

35:35.125 --> 35:37.500
-Anyone want more?
-Don't smoke in here, Miguel.

35:37.583 --> 35:39.125
Uncle, no!

35:45.583 --> 35:47.291
-New Year's plans?
-No plans.

35:47.375 --> 35:49.208
Wanna go out or rent something?

35:49.291 --> 35:50.958
-Like what?
-A cabin.

35:51.041 --> 35:53.208
What if there is no tomorrow?

35:53.291 --> 35:54.291
All right, fine.

35:54.375 --> 35:56.125
-Good one.
-Drive safe.

35:59.833 --> 36:03.791
<i>First, ask yourself if you got rid</i>
<i>of that long face at dinner.</i>

36:05.416 --> 36:07.625
<i>For real? Or are you just saying that?</i>

36:08.291 --> 36:09.291
Shut up.

36:09.375 --> 36:10.833
<i>All right.</i>

36:10.916 --> 36:12.500
<i>Go to step two.</i>

36:12.583 --> 36:13.416
Okay.

36:15.833 --> 36:19.500
<i>Put the apple salad in a bowl.</i>

36:19.583 --> 36:22.291
<i>Mix it with two portions of cod.</i>

36:22.875 --> 36:25.791
<i>Add the shrimp,</i>

36:25.875 --> 36:27.500
<i>and then the Cheez Whiz.</i>

36:27.583 --> 36:29.791
<i>Mix it together well.</i>

36:31.041 --> 36:32.458
<i>Smells good, right?</i>

36:34.708 --> 36:36.500
-Now what?
<i>-Go up to the roof.</i>

36:37.583 --> 36:39.875
<i>I want you to put on boxers</i>

36:39.958 --> 36:43.791
<i>and wrap yourself</i>
<i>in lights like a Christmas tree.</i>

36:43.875 --> 36:45.333
What? No. Not boxers.

36:45.416 --> 36:46.250
<i>Do it!</i>

36:46.333 --> 36:47.666
No. Not boxers!

36:47.750 --> 36:48.791
<i>What do you mean no?</i>

36:49.500 --> 36:51.416
What did you do? I'm going to freeze!

36:51.500 --> 36:53.416
<i>You look perfect, Chuy.</i>

36:54.000 --> 36:57.375
<i>Now, eat three big spoonfuls</i>

36:57.458 --> 36:59.250
<i>and don't make a long face.</i>

37:00.458 --> 37:01.708
<i>One…</i>

37:03.958 --> 37:05.250
<i>So delicious.</i>

37:06.291 --> 37:07.791
<i>Two…</i>

37:09.416 --> 37:11.500
<i>Enjoy it, Chuy.</i>

37:13.166 --> 37:16.291
<i>And… three.</i>

37:16.791 --> 37:18.416
<i>Big.</i>

37:19.541 --> 37:21.291
<i>That's it, Chuy.</i>

37:22.000 --> 37:24.750
<i>Now, I'll tell you a spell</i>

37:24.833 --> 37:28.625
<i>that you have to repeat exactly.</i>

37:28.708 --> 37:30.541
<i>You can't make a mistake.</i>

37:31.041 --> 37:32.250
<i>Ready?</i>

37:32.833 --> 37:34.416
<i>Repeat after me.</i>

37:38.291 --> 37:42.458
<i>Christmas, oh Christmas.</i>
<i>I didn't respect you.</i>

37:42.958 --> 37:46.958
<i>Forgive my mistakes and let me go back.</i>

37:47.625 --> 37:50.416
Christmas, oh Christmas.
I didn't respect you.

37:51.208 --> 37:52.458
Allow my mistakes…

37:52.541 --> 37:53.666
<i>"Forgive," Chuy!</i>

37:55.791 --> 37:56.625
Okay.

37:57.208 --> 38:00.083
Christmas, oh Christmas,
I didn't respect you.

38:00.958 --> 38:02.250
Forgive my mistakes…

38:03.125 --> 38:06.916
-And jump in place?
-<i>"Let me go back"! Concentrate!</i>

38:08.833 --> 38:09.708
Okay.

38:09.791 --> 38:12.791
Christmas, oh Christmas,
I didn't respect you.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.166
Forgive my mistakes…

38:15.250 --> 38:16.750
Chuy, what are you doing?

38:18.041 --> 38:18.916
I'm coming!

38:19.583 --> 38:20.500
Help me out.

38:21.125 --> 38:24.000
Christmas, oh Christmas,
I didn't respect you.

38:24.083 --> 38:26.833
Forgive my mistakes and let me go back.

38:29.541 --> 38:30.375
What happened?

38:31.708 --> 38:33.750
Christmas, oh Christmas,
I didn't respect you.

38:33.833 --> 38:36.166
Forgive my mistakes and let me go back.

38:59.416 --> 39:06.208
<i>Happy birthday to you…</i>

39:07.416 --> 39:08.750
THE NEXT ONE…

39:08.833 --> 39:10.000
No, Bobby.

39:11.958 --> 39:13.958
No, Mom! Not on my birthday!

39:19.000 --> 39:21.125
It's not time to open presents yet.

39:22.750 --> 39:25.041
-Hey, don't forget to…
-…get the presents.

39:25.583 --> 39:26.583
No breakfast?

39:31.416 --> 39:32.541
Hey, you!

39:33.375 --> 39:34.916
Why didn't it work?

39:35.000 --> 39:36.708
I endured Christmas.

39:36.791 --> 39:37.916
I did what you said,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
practically without a long face.

39:42.583 --> 39:45.208
-I love you.
-I missed a lot in one year.

39:45.291 --> 39:47.166
You haven't missed anything.

39:47.250 --> 39:50.916
You've been there the whole time
with your long face.

39:52.041 --> 39:53.083
Enough!

39:53.791 --> 39:57.375
-Tell me what I have to do. I'll do it.
-Have you never seen a Christmas movie?

39:57.458 --> 40:00.250
I'm not giving you the answer.
It's not that easy.

40:00.333 --> 40:04.000
You have to live and experience Christmas.

40:04.083 --> 40:05.708
Savor the crumbs.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.708
Say thank you, dear.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.916
Stop right there, Bunny.

40:21.000 --> 40:21.958
Turn off the stove.

40:22.041 --> 40:24.666
I just ordered a feast.

40:25.291 --> 40:27.833
Pizzas from Lucca. Chow mein from Mr. Lee.

40:28.333 --> 40:30.458
Sandwiches from Mrs. Clemen.
Tacos from Tocayo.

40:30.541 --> 40:32.291
I… didn't order dessert.

40:32.375 --> 40:35.583
Because you make the best churros
and I want to savor all the crumbs.

40:35.666 --> 40:39.125
What about your mom's Cheez Whiz?
She'll feel horrible.

40:39.208 --> 40:41.708
Bunny, we need to, well,

40:42.583 --> 40:44.791
to enjoy the crumbs of life.

40:45.375 --> 40:46.708
It'll be delicious.

40:47.500 --> 40:48.333
No, dear.

40:48.416 --> 40:50.000
We can't. It's too expensive.

40:50.083 --> 40:51.833
Try to understand, dear.

40:52.375 --> 40:54.458
This is the only way
to get rid of the spell.

40:54.541 --> 40:57.833
While you're stuck with that spell,
life goes on.

40:58.416 --> 41:01.583
Your son is upstairs.
He wants to skip Christmas.

41:01.666 --> 41:04.416
He says if you can, so can he. Fix it.

41:04.500 --> 41:05.333
Okay.

41:06.083 --> 41:06.916
I'll fix it.

41:08.458 --> 41:09.458
Who is it?

41:09.541 --> 41:11.625
Why don't you want to come downstairs?

41:12.750 --> 41:13.791
I don't know.

41:17.750 --> 41:19.125
What do you mean?

41:19.708 --> 41:21.208
I want to be alone.

41:21.750 --> 41:22.750
Is that alright?

41:23.500 --> 41:24.708
Yes, of course it is.

41:24.791 --> 41:27.708
But it's Christmas
and a lot of people are coming over.

41:27.791 --> 41:31.291
But you always leave.
This time I want to go with you.

41:31.375 --> 41:35.041
The thing is,
I'm under a spell and you're not.

41:35.125 --> 41:38.041
The whole family will be here
and it will be fun.

41:38.125 --> 41:41.583
-You should enjoy life's crumbs.
-Shouldn't you be with the family?

41:44.625 --> 41:45.458
I have to go.

41:46.416 --> 41:47.291
Come downstairs?

41:48.375 --> 41:49.958
Okay, good talk.

41:53.291 --> 41:54.791
-Dad.
-What?

41:56.083 --> 41:57.708
Nothing. Forget it.

41:58.208 --> 41:59.958
Are you coming downstairs?

42:05.833 --> 42:08.666
Come in, over here.

42:08.750 --> 42:11.625
Check this out. Italian food<i> di la nonna.</i>

42:11.708 --> 42:13.166
<i>Pizza di Salvatore.</i>

42:13.250 --> 42:15.916
<i>N ho ma</i>. Chinese food.
Say hi to Mr. Lee.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.875
Look at the chicken breasts
from Mrs. Clemen. Delicious!

42:18.958 --> 42:21.083
Jacal's tacos! Yes!

42:21.166 --> 42:24.083
Now we're ready for Christmas!

42:24.166 --> 42:25.791
<i>Feliz Navidad</i>

42:25.875 --> 42:28.125
<i>Prospero año y felicidad</i>

42:30.583 --> 42:31.500
Merry Christmas.

42:31.583 --> 42:33.000
-Thanks.
-Merry Christmas.

42:33.083 --> 42:35.291
-Thank you.
-Merry Christmas.

42:35.958 --> 42:38.041
-Merry Christmas.
-Bye.

42:38.125 --> 42:40.791
-And Merry Christmas.
-All the best.

42:41.500 --> 42:42.875
Merry Christmas!

42:42.958 --> 42:45.000
Hi, son. Help your dad with that.

42:45.750 --> 42:47.666
Your sister is an awful driver.

42:47.750 --> 42:49.958
I heard you, you're worse.

42:50.541 --> 42:53.208
You need to heat up the cheese.
I like it very melted.

42:53.291 --> 42:55.916
No, Dad. That's petroleum. It's all toxic.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.250
What's all this food?

42:57.875 --> 43:00.041
I ordered takeout
so you wouldn't have to cook.

43:00.541 --> 43:04.000
But I want to cook for you.

43:04.083 --> 43:05.625
I know.

43:05.708 --> 43:08.500
But now we can enjoy
all the crumbs of Christmas.

43:08.583 --> 43:10.041
What's with all this food?

43:10.125 --> 43:11.875
I was just telling Mom.

43:11.958 --> 43:13.083
And the turkey?

43:13.166 --> 43:16.000
-What turkey?
-Your mom baked a turkey for six hours.

43:16.500 --> 43:19.250
That's good because I didn't order turkey.

43:19.833 --> 43:21.583
The others are here. I'll be back.

43:25.333 --> 43:26.750
Can we open the presents?

43:27.416 --> 43:28.583
All right.

43:29.291 --> 43:32.333
Tupperware!

43:32.416 --> 43:34.208
That's so great.

43:35.000 --> 43:35.875
All good, Uncle?

43:37.416 --> 43:38.666
Sure, my boy.

43:39.416 --> 43:43.166
It's nice to have a drink in peace.

43:43.250 --> 43:44.625
To really enjoy the drink.

43:44.708 --> 43:45.541
Right?

43:46.291 --> 43:47.416
I gave up drinking.

43:48.875 --> 43:50.583
But it didn't give me up!

43:50.666 --> 43:52.541
What a good joke, brother.

43:52.625 --> 43:54.500
Open your present.

43:54.583 --> 43:55.666
Let's see.

43:55.750 --> 43:56.875
Wow!

43:56.958 --> 43:58.916
A paintball gun!

43:59.916 --> 44:01.208
A joke book.

44:02.333 --> 44:05.541
The paintball gun
is for all those battles on our land.

44:06.791 --> 44:09.750
What?
There's no more paintball on the property.

44:10.958 --> 44:12.166
Really?

44:12.250 --> 44:14.416
No, I started construction.

44:15.750 --> 44:16.583
What?

44:17.083 --> 44:20.291
Right now it's just a prefabricated room,

44:20.375 --> 44:23.041
but I'm planning the house.
Bobby is helping me.

44:24.375 --> 44:26.125
Are you okay? You look a little pale.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
No, don't worry.

44:30.083 --> 44:31.083
Well, this year…

44:34.666 --> 44:38.083
I don't want that.
I want turkey with Cheez Whiz.

44:38.166 --> 44:41.625
-Did you get some sauce?
-Eat up or no gifts.

44:45.083 --> 44:46.791
Why don't you have some turkey?

44:46.875 --> 44:47.791
Cheers!

44:49.291 --> 44:52.458
Cheers! Merry Christmas!

45:04.666 --> 45:09.166
<i>Happy birthday to you…</i>

45:09.708 --> 45:12.041
-Where are you going?
-Get lost.

45:12.125 --> 45:13.208
ANOTHER YEAR…

45:13.291 --> 45:14.541
What's wrong with him?

45:33.750 --> 45:35.000
No.

45:44.500 --> 45:47.250
FOR LEASE

45:54.875 --> 45:57.291
No way.

46:04.208 --> 46:06.458
Everyone is invited to Mass!

46:06.541 --> 46:08.250
It will be great!

46:08.333 --> 46:10.500
Mass is starting!

46:12.166 --> 46:13.250
Diva Godmother?

46:13.333 --> 46:15.666
Everyone come to Mass!

46:15.750 --> 46:17.041
Hurry!

46:17.125 --> 46:20.625
-Why are you dressed like a priest?
-I'm spreading the word of God.

46:20.708 --> 46:22.208
Tell me some gossip.

46:22.291 --> 46:24.458
I mean tell me your sins. Come.

46:24.541 --> 46:26.875
Everyone, hurry to Mass!

46:26.958 --> 46:29.125
Take this spell off of me already.

46:30.166 --> 46:32.000
Tell me your sins.

46:32.083 --> 46:33.083
Well, Father.

46:33.833 --> 46:37.750
A few days ago,
I told my family that they were moochers

46:37.833 --> 46:40.458
and jerks for taking advantage of me.

46:40.541 --> 46:41.708
I felt overwhelmed.

46:42.208 --> 46:43.250
I know.

46:43.333 --> 46:46.208
We say things we don't mean
when we're angry.

46:46.791 --> 46:50.208
But never forget
about forgiveness and compassion.

46:50.291 --> 46:51.958
-Father.
-My son.

46:52.041 --> 46:54.625
Don't give me that.
You're not even a priest.

46:54.708 --> 46:56.833
-Pretend I am.
-Fine.

46:56.916 --> 46:59.500
Explain why Christmas,

47:00.166 --> 47:02.166
the birth of Jesus,

47:02.250 --> 47:04.958
has become a celebration of Santa Claus?

47:05.041 --> 47:08.208
Don't you know
the story of Saint Nicholas?

47:08.916 --> 47:10.250
-No?
-About Papa Noël?

47:10.333 --> 47:12.791
-Santa Claus?
-I said no.

47:12.875 --> 47:14.291
Well, Saint Nicholas

47:14.375 --> 47:19.166
was born in a small town,
in the third or fourth century.

47:19.250 --> 47:21.500
His parents raised him

47:21.583 --> 47:24.500
to be the best Christian ever.

47:24.583 --> 47:27.291
We're talking about a kid
with a lot of money.

47:27.958 --> 47:30.958
But just like Batman, his parents died.

47:31.041 --> 47:33.541
And he was left alone in the world.

47:33.625 --> 47:36.416
Unlike Batman,
he didn't want to fight crime.

47:36.500 --> 47:41.583
He dedicated himself
to giving away his inheritance to the poor

47:41.666 --> 47:43.541
and to serving God in that way.

47:44.500 --> 47:45.333
Wow.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.916
That's the story of Santa Claus.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.875
A very good man.

47:52.875 --> 47:55.166
So if I act like Santa Claus,

47:56.000 --> 47:57.166
you'll undo the spell.

47:57.250 --> 47:58.708
Yes, but do it right.

47:58.791 --> 48:00.791
Sure. I'll try my best.

48:01.750 --> 48:03.625
-Thanks, Father.
-Go on, child.

48:03.708 --> 48:04.541
Yes.

48:05.083 --> 48:06.958
That child.

48:10.625 --> 48:11.458
Kids!

48:11.541 --> 48:13.000
Christmas is here!

48:20.583 --> 48:22.875
<i>Jingle bells!</i>

48:22.958 --> 48:23.791
Okay.

48:23.875 --> 48:25.833
-Stuffies!
-Stuffies!

48:25.916 --> 48:27.375
Give me Santa.

48:28.250 --> 48:29.541
-Put him on the piano.
-Okay.

48:30.416 --> 48:32.666
-What do you think?
-This is Christmas.

48:32.750 --> 48:33.750
What else do you want?

48:33.833 --> 48:36.458
You can yell and pout all you want.

48:36.541 --> 48:38.916
-You're not going to Acapulco.
-What's wrong?

48:39.000 --> 48:41.625
She failed three classes
and still wants to go to Acapulco.

48:41.708 --> 48:44.250
It's happened to all of us.

48:44.333 --> 48:47.666
No. I was never about to be expelled
for cheating on a test.

48:47.750 --> 48:49.333
What? Expelled?

48:49.416 --> 48:51.041
We won't know until January.

48:51.125 --> 48:53.416
January? No! Come here.

48:53.500 --> 48:54.500
This is important.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.708
Family circle.

48:57.291 --> 49:00.208
It's Christmas. And look at us.

49:00.291 --> 49:03.041
We're yelling at each other,
we're arguing.

49:03.625 --> 49:08.375
Christmas is about being friends,
not enemies.

49:09.416 --> 49:11.541
And I want to apologize

49:12.875 --> 49:14.125
for not being your friend.

49:16.375 --> 49:18.291
It feels so good to apologize.

49:19.458 --> 49:21.500
-Who's next?
-What's this?

49:21.583 --> 49:24.333
-I refuse to participate.
-Girl, come back here.

49:24.416 --> 49:26.458
Don't break the circle. This is important.

49:26.541 --> 49:29.958
I need to be Saint Nicholas this Christmas
or else I won't break the spell.

49:30.041 --> 49:32.625
There it is, the damn spell.

49:32.708 --> 49:34.791
You say it every year. It's not funny.

49:34.875 --> 49:36.416
I'm not joking, I'm serious.

49:36.500 --> 49:38.583
It's just an excuse
for you to get your way.

49:38.666 --> 49:40.416
-You don't believe me?
-In the spell?

49:40.500 --> 49:42.083
-You don't believe me?
-Every year?

49:42.166 --> 49:44.083
-You don't believe me?
-No.

49:44.166 --> 49:45.125
You don't believe me.

49:45.208 --> 49:46.291
You know what?

49:47.041 --> 49:48.250
I'm going out.

49:48.333 --> 49:51.541
To share with my fellow man,
like Santa Claus.

49:51.625 --> 49:54.375
That's what you do on Christmas.
It's the Christmas spirit.

49:55.250 --> 49:57.458
-Who's coming with me?
-No one.

49:57.541 --> 49:58.708
Really?

50:18.000 --> 50:19.375
That's it.

50:26.250 --> 50:27.875
<i>Hello! My name is Tito.</i>

50:27.958 --> 50:29.833
<i>Good evening and Merry Christmas.</i>

50:29.916 --> 50:31.250
<i>Can I take your order?</i>

50:31.333 --> 50:34.875
Yes, Tito. Can you give me
20 Christmas combos, please?

50:34.958 --> 50:41.625
<i>Do you want the combo</i>
<i>for 49, 59, or 69 pesos?</i>

50:41.708 --> 50:42.708
Forty-nine pesos.

50:43.291 --> 50:46.666
<i>That's 980 pesos, please.</i>

50:46.750 --> 50:50.125
<i>Do you want to round up to 1,000 pesos</i>
<i>and donate to the House of Joy?</i>

50:50.833 --> 50:51.708
No.

50:51.791 --> 50:53.125
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

50:53.208 --> 50:54.625
I said no!

50:54.708 --> 50:56.041
<i>Hello?</i>

50:56.125 --> 50:58.000
No! I already said no!

50:58.708 --> 51:00.500
<i>Yes? Hello?</i>

51:01.083 --> 51:02.208
Okay, sure.

51:02.291 --> 51:03.500
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

51:04.541 --> 51:07.625
<i>The children with disabilities</i>
<i>greatly appreciate it.</i>

51:12.041 --> 51:13.625
Hello. How are you?

51:13.708 --> 51:15.208
Thank you for your donation.

51:15.875 --> 51:17.000
Here you go.

51:17.083 --> 51:18.583
I've received your money.

51:18.666 --> 51:22.583
Now I'll get you your Christmas combos.

51:23.291 --> 51:25.791
Here you go. Thank you for your donation.

51:26.458 --> 51:30.375
It will help children suffering
from extreme hunger.

51:30.458 --> 51:35.041
They haven't eaten for days.

51:36.250 --> 51:39.416
Your donation will buy
a lot of food for them.

51:40.625 --> 51:43.000
Thank you very much and Merry Christmas.

51:44.208 --> 51:45.291
That's all 20, right?

51:47.458 --> 51:48.291
Okay.

52:04.166 --> 52:05.916
CHILDREN'S SHELTER

52:11.791 --> 52:14.916
Nun!

52:15.000 --> 52:16.250
I'm coming.

52:20.291 --> 52:21.125
Good evening.

52:21.208 --> 52:25.166
I brought you these hamburgers
to share with the kids for Christmas. Bye.

52:38.833 --> 52:42.916
<i>Happy birthday to you…</i>

52:43.000 --> 52:46.458
THREE YEARS LATER…

52:49.791 --> 52:50.708
Where are you going?

52:51.208 --> 52:52.083
I'm…

52:52.958 --> 52:54.583
I'm going to break this spell.

52:54.666 --> 52:57.291
Hold on, I have to talk to you.

52:57.958 --> 53:00.958
It's confirmed.
Braulio is investing in my business.

53:01.041 --> 53:02.791
I need to open a bank account.

53:03.291 --> 53:04.666
-Hold on, who?
-Braulio.

53:05.250 --> 53:06.500
Who's Braulio?

53:06.583 --> 53:08.666
Braulio de León, my angel investor.

53:09.291 --> 53:11.958
Yes, right. Braulio.

53:12.041 --> 53:14.083
-Paola really caught me off guard.
-Why?

53:14.166 --> 53:15.708
Maybe I should turn it down

53:15.791 --> 53:19.041
to spend more time with her
to make sure she's on the right track.

53:19.125 --> 53:20.250
What should I do?

53:20.333 --> 53:22.250
Paula's getting expelled?

53:22.333 --> 53:23.833
-What?
-Yes, she was expelled.

53:23.916 --> 53:26.541
And she's hanging out
with two girls I don't like.

53:27.125 --> 53:29.833
See? I told you a million times.

53:29.916 --> 53:33.083
Being an entrepreneur and a mom don't mix.

53:33.166 --> 53:34.375
-Really?
-No.

53:34.458 --> 53:36.583
Well, help me make a decision.

53:36.666 --> 53:38.041
That's what I'm doing.

53:38.125 --> 53:40.333
I want to help you decide.

53:40.416 --> 53:42.750
But there's no way I can
while I'm under this spell.

53:50.833 --> 53:51.791
Popsicle, sir?

53:54.625 --> 53:55.625
Popsicle?

54:11.916 --> 54:12.875
You levitate now?

54:12.958 --> 54:15.750
Haven't you ever read
<i>The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari</i>?

54:15.833 --> 54:18.125
Great book! I'm obsessed with it.

54:18.208 --> 54:19.666
I don't read cheap philosophy.

54:19.750 --> 54:21.833
I'm in my Buddhist phase. Leave me alone.

54:21.916 --> 54:26.583
Really? Well, I'm in my
"take this spell off me" phase.

54:26.666 --> 54:29.083
The Buddha wants you to understand

54:29.166 --> 54:31.666
that the spell is likely your karma.

54:34.250 --> 54:36.208
Karma? No, hold on.

54:36.291 --> 54:38.458
I've done everything you asked me to.

54:38.541 --> 54:41.708
Tell me what Christmas wants from me,
then we can talk about karma.

54:41.791 --> 54:44.625
Christmas wants exactly what Buddha wants.

54:47.375 --> 54:50.625
They want you to give.
Even if you don't have a lot to give.

54:50.708 --> 54:54.625
Giving more or giving less.
Giving is giving.

54:54.708 --> 54:58.625
-Giving is giving.
-Giving is giving.

54:59.291 --> 55:00.375
Giving is giving.

55:01.250 --> 55:04.083
Of course. Like the song by Fito Páez.

55:05.916 --> 55:07.875
I didn't know Fito was a Buddhist.

55:07.958 --> 55:09.375
Yes.

55:09.458 --> 55:10.625
My best pupil.

55:11.125 --> 55:12.791
Sit down, we can keep talking.

55:16.041 --> 55:17.833
<i>Giving is giving</i>

55:19.000 --> 55:22.125
<i>Not being attached</i>
<i>To what you might get back</i>

55:24.333 --> 55:27.041
<i>Giving is giving</i>

55:27.708 --> 55:30.541
<i>Not telling anyone</i>
<i>If they should stay or go</i>

55:32.625 --> 55:34.875
<i>When the world asks you</i>
<i>Why, why, why…</i>

55:34.958 --> 55:36.083
-Auntie!
-Majo.

55:36.166 --> 55:38.125
-What?
-It's your turn.

55:38.208 --> 55:40.375
No, I'll lose the yarn.

55:40.458 --> 55:43.208
<i>I say to them, giving is giving</i>

55:43.291 --> 55:44.541
For jinxing me.

55:45.708 --> 55:47.750
<i>Giving is giving…</i>

55:48.583 --> 55:51.166
-Chuy.
-I'm not playing.

55:51.250 --> 55:53.958
Stop begging for attention.
Take a present.

55:54.041 --> 55:57.500
I don't need a present,
I'm like Buddha, I give.

55:57.583 --> 56:01.333
<i>Giving is giving…</i>

56:07.666 --> 56:13.000
<i>Happy birthday to you…</i>

56:14.791 --> 56:18.333
NEXT CHRISTMAS EVE…

56:18.416 --> 56:19.833
Why are you praying, son?

56:20.333 --> 56:23.208
Since when are you religious?

56:24.083 --> 56:26.958
I started praying
so they'll stop beating me up at school.

56:27.583 --> 56:29.500
What? Are you still being bullied?

56:31.333 --> 56:33.416
-At the new school too?
-What new school?

56:33.500 --> 56:37.458
I've been asking you to transfer me
for a year now.

56:55.041 --> 56:55.916
Diva Godmother?

56:58.458 --> 56:59.583
You're a rabbi now?

56:59.666 --> 57:03.625
I had a Jewish boyfriend,
and we couldn't date unless I converted.

57:03.708 --> 57:05.791
You're not Jewish.
What are you doing here?

57:05.875 --> 57:08.958
At this point,
I'll take advice from anyone.

57:09.041 --> 57:10.291
You're lost, right?

57:10.375 --> 57:12.250
Yes, I'm lost in your Christmas.

57:12.333 --> 57:14.208
-In my Christmas?
-Yes, in your Christmas.

57:14.291 --> 57:17.208
Blaming others won't fix anything.

57:17.291 --> 57:19.833
What should I do? I'm lost.

57:19.916 --> 57:22.208
We've done karma, we've done Santa Claus.

57:22.291 --> 57:24.166
I need answers. What should I do?

57:24.750 --> 57:27.708
When we Jews need answers,

57:27.791 --> 57:29.291
we turn to the Bible.

57:29.916 --> 57:30.958
Pray.

57:31.041 --> 57:33.250
When we want to talk to God, we pray.

57:33.333 --> 57:35.291
When we want to thank him, we pray.

57:35.833 --> 57:38.041
-Pray, Chuy.
-Right. Yeah.

57:38.541 --> 57:39.416
Pray.

57:40.041 --> 57:43.041
-So I need to bless the food?
-If you want.

57:44.416 --> 57:46.541
Do I have to walk to church on my knees?

57:46.625 --> 57:50.500
That's not a Jewish tradition,
but you can if you want.

58:02.125 --> 58:05.458
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

58:05.541 --> 58:07.625
Blessed art thou among women,

58:07.708 --> 58:10.250
and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

58:10.333 --> 58:13.666
Holy Mary,
Mother of God, pray for us sinners,

58:13.750 --> 58:16.583
now and in the hour of our death. Amen.

58:16.666 --> 58:19.916
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.541
Blessed art thou among women,

58:22.625 --> 58:24.958
and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

58:25.041 --> 58:27.958
Holy Mary,
Mother of God, pray for us sinners…

58:33.916 --> 58:37.708
<i>Happy birthday to you…</i>

58:37.791 --> 58:40.041
No.

58:41.625 --> 58:43.750
ANOTHER YEAR…

58:43.833 --> 58:46.250
Stop this nightmare already.

58:50.500 --> 58:51.833
-My dear.
-Yeah?

58:51.916 --> 58:52.833
The presents.

58:53.416 --> 58:56.416
Yes, I'm on my way to the mall
to have all my money stolen. Bye.

58:57.125 --> 58:59.916
-Bye.
-Hold on, I want to talk to you.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.916
-Chuy, wait.
-What?

59:02.000 --> 59:04.333
Your brother called.
He's bringing two girls.

59:04.416 --> 59:06.375
Not one, two.

59:07.750 --> 59:08.916
Where's that tacky thing?

59:09.000 --> 59:14.291
I haven't put it up for years.
You said it was gringo nonsense.

59:15.708 --> 59:17.958
I know it's your birthday
and it's Christmas.

59:18.541 --> 59:20.000
Don't be bitter this year.

59:20.083 --> 59:21.125
We all love you.

59:21.750 --> 59:23.583
-Okay. Bye.
-Cheer up.

59:45.875 --> 59:48.416
Welcome!
What do you want to become an iMaster in?

59:50.166 --> 59:51.250
Conrado?

59:51.333 --> 59:53.833
Mr. Cienfuegos is in his office.
How can I help you?

59:53.916 --> 59:56.041
No. He's right behind you.

59:56.125 --> 59:58.166
Thank you, Miriam. I'll help him.

59:58.250 --> 59:59.250
Thanks, Miriam.

1:00:00.666 --> 1:00:04.083
Steve Jobs would be super proud of you.

1:00:04.166 --> 1:00:06.083
Thank you for saying that.

1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:08.625
I never imagined seeing you here.

1:00:09.125 --> 1:00:11.041
I'm sorry about how things ended.

1:00:11.125 --> 1:00:13.416
Yeah, what a shame about Legends.

1:00:13.916 --> 1:00:15.458
I was sad when I found out.

1:00:15.958 --> 1:00:17.500
It was a hard blow.

1:00:17.583 --> 1:00:22.958
I still think that business
has opportunities in the digital world.

1:00:23.583 --> 1:00:24.666
No way.

1:00:25.541 --> 1:00:27.708
Legends is history. "Digital."

1:00:29.291 --> 1:00:32.125
You should take one of my classes.

1:00:32.208 --> 1:00:34.083
You could become an iMaster.

1:00:34.166 --> 1:00:35.000
What?

1:00:35.083 --> 1:00:36.166
No, Conrado.

1:00:36.875 --> 1:00:39.291
I'm too old to be an iMaster.

1:00:39.375 --> 1:00:42.208
I'll either come up with a new business

1:00:42.291 --> 1:00:44.333
or wait to see how Daniela's goes.

1:00:45.625 --> 1:00:48.583
Braulio de León
is her angel investor, right?

1:00:50.583 --> 1:00:52.000
-I think so.
-He's a god.

1:00:52.541 --> 1:00:54.041
He invested in all of this.

1:00:54.125 --> 1:00:55.750
We're opening our fourth store.

1:00:56.500 --> 1:00:57.916
Wow. What a dog!

1:00:58.916 --> 1:01:00.291
More like, what a lion.

1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:02.333
Hey.

1:01:05.750 --> 1:01:08.166
What if I asked you to be my associate?

1:01:08.250 --> 1:01:09.375
Really?

1:01:10.291 --> 1:01:11.500
You'd do that for me?

1:01:12.291 --> 1:01:13.916
In the spirit of Christmas.

1:01:15.083 --> 1:01:15.958
Conrado.

1:01:16.958 --> 1:01:18.416
That would be incredible.

1:01:19.333 --> 1:01:20.250
Thanks.

1:01:22.458 --> 1:01:25.583
And if you work really hard,

1:01:25.666 --> 1:01:28.791
you could be the Associate of the Month.

1:01:28.875 --> 1:01:30.500
ASSOCIATE OF THE MONTH
SARAÍ M

1:01:30.625 --> 1:01:32.291
It was nice seeing you.

1:01:32.375 --> 1:01:36.666
Don't forget to call Miriam
for an interview.

1:01:38.708 --> 1:01:40.125
By the way,

1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:42.041
happy birthday.

1:01:54.541 --> 1:01:57.000
<i>Happy birthday to you…</i>

1:01:57.083 --> 1:01:58.125
ONE MORE…

1:01:58.208 --> 1:02:00.583
Get me out of here!

1:02:03.125 --> 1:02:05.291
No. What's this about being a pescatarian?

1:02:05.375 --> 1:02:07.833
No way. Eat that.

1:02:07.916 --> 1:02:09.833
-But Mom…
-Hey, don't forget the…

1:02:09.916 --> 1:02:11.041
Yes, the presents.

1:02:34.750 --> 1:02:36.541
-Look, Dad.
-What's up, dear?

1:02:37.250 --> 1:02:38.625
I bought a new sweater.

1:02:39.125 --> 1:02:40.458
-That's nice.
-Right?

1:02:40.541 --> 1:02:42.291
I need to change too.

1:02:42.375 --> 1:02:44.750
-Wait, let me get the tag.
-No, Dad.

1:02:45.375 --> 1:02:47.291
-Why'd you take off the tag?
-What?

1:02:47.375 --> 1:02:49.958
-Why do you need the tag?
-To return it.

1:02:50.041 --> 1:02:51.375
Return it? I thought you liked it.

1:02:51.458 --> 1:02:55.958
I want the money back,
or to exchange it for something else.

1:02:56.791 --> 1:02:57.708
Why?

1:02:58.208 --> 1:02:59.708
That's how it works, Dad.

1:02:59.791 --> 1:03:00.875
What works?

1:03:00.958 --> 1:03:05.833
Everyone does it. You give back the item
with the tag and you get your money back.

1:03:05.916 --> 1:03:08.875
If someone's going to pay,
better them than me. Right?

1:03:22.750 --> 1:03:25.708
Auntie! Uncle! Merry Christmas!

1:03:26.291 --> 1:03:27.833
Brother! Come in.

1:03:28.625 --> 1:03:29.458
Happy birthday.

1:03:30.250 --> 1:03:33.291
-Mom! Dad! Merry Christmas!
-Happy birthday, son.

1:03:34.125 --> 1:03:36.041
Little sister, you look great.

1:03:36.125 --> 1:03:38.083
Merry Christmas.

1:03:38.166 --> 1:03:39.541
Happy birthday.

1:04:26.708 --> 1:04:28.625
It's just you this time?

1:04:28.708 --> 1:04:31.041
They got tired of your long face, Chuy.

1:04:33.458 --> 1:04:34.500
Happy birthday.

1:04:34.583 --> 1:04:36.458
AND ANOTHER ONE…

1:04:42.708 --> 1:04:43.875
What's wrong, son?

1:04:44.541 --> 1:04:45.625
Guys at school again.

1:04:47.625 --> 1:04:50.125
What has to happen
for me to change schools?

1:04:54.416 --> 1:04:56.000
I know what you need. Come.

1:04:56.500 --> 1:04:58.041
Change your clothes. Come with me.

1:05:01.708 --> 1:05:04.708
I hate all this
ever since I got hurt in karate.

1:05:04.791 --> 1:05:06.500
Take it easy.

1:05:06.583 --> 1:05:09.583
I'm going to introduce you
to the champion. What's up, man?

1:05:11.125 --> 1:05:12.916
-What's up, Chuy?
-How are you, champ?

1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:14.958
-Very well, and you?
-A bit concerned.

1:05:15.041 --> 1:05:17.583
Why's that? Hold on, I'm coming over.

1:05:17.666 --> 1:05:18.666
All right.

1:05:20.041 --> 1:05:21.750
-Hey, Chuy.
-What's up, champ?

1:05:22.333 --> 1:05:24.375
My son is being bullied.

1:05:24.458 --> 1:05:26.791
-What? That's not possible.
-Right?

1:05:26.875 --> 1:05:29.041
I'll teach you some good moves.

1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:31.500
Raise your hands, like this.

1:05:32.125 --> 1:05:33.583
Move the waist, raise the fists.

1:05:38.583 --> 1:05:41.500
-Listen to him. Raise your fists.
-Raise them.

1:05:41.583 --> 1:05:42.708
Teach him, champ.

1:05:42.791 --> 1:05:45.166
-This is for self-defense.
-Is this what you want?

1:05:45.250 --> 1:05:46.666
For me to fight everyone?

1:05:47.458 --> 1:05:48.416
No, son.

1:05:49.750 --> 1:05:52.916
I just want you to learn
to defend yourself.

1:05:54.458 --> 1:05:56.833
-Dad, this is a waste of time.
-What?

1:05:56.916 --> 1:05:57.750
Why?

1:05:59.041 --> 1:06:00.000
You don't understand.

1:06:00.583 --> 1:06:01.458
What?

1:06:02.416 --> 1:06:04.000
You look at me but you don't see.

1:06:05.541 --> 1:06:06.958
What am I not seeing?

1:06:07.541 --> 1:06:08.375
Óscar!

1:06:08.458 --> 1:06:11.625
Easy, Chuy.
Not everything can be fixed with fighting.

1:06:31.125 --> 1:06:35.500
DECEMBER 24,
CHRISTMAS EVE

1:06:48.041 --> 1:06:49.166
Good morning.

1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:51.916
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

1:06:53.416 --> 1:06:54.791
No cake today?

1:06:58.250 --> 1:06:59.458
What are you doing, Bunny?

1:06:59.541 --> 1:07:01.916
I'm just paying taxes.

1:07:03.791 --> 1:07:04.750
Where's Óscar?

1:07:05.541 --> 1:07:07.666
What will it be this year, Dad?

1:07:07.750 --> 1:07:10.625
-Are we going to church on our knees?
-What's with you?

1:07:10.708 --> 1:07:11.541
What?

1:07:11.625 --> 1:07:13.541
Since when did you become so cynical?

1:07:14.250 --> 1:07:15.750
Who do you think I take after?

1:07:15.833 --> 1:07:17.291
Hold on, wait!

1:07:17.375 --> 1:07:19.416
-What's wrong with you?
-What do you mean?

1:07:19.916 --> 1:07:22.833
-You didn't use to be like this.
-How was I?

1:07:23.375 --> 1:07:24.958
I don't know, different.

1:07:25.041 --> 1:07:26.416
-I see.
-Yes, different.

1:07:26.500 --> 1:07:27.958
You were a sweet girl.

1:07:28.583 --> 1:07:30.583
Now you're bitter.

1:07:30.666 --> 1:07:33.583
-Oh well, that's life.
-No, that's not life.

1:07:34.958 --> 1:07:35.791
You know what?

1:07:36.500 --> 1:07:37.583
This ends today.

1:07:38.125 --> 1:07:39.625
Hold on.

1:07:41.583 --> 1:07:42.750
Chuy! Jesús!

1:07:43.250 --> 1:07:45.416
-What?
-You're leaving again?

1:07:45.500 --> 1:07:48.041
I'm sorry, but this has gone on too long.

1:07:48.875 --> 1:07:50.791
Yes, you're right. It's been too long.

1:08:43.875 --> 1:08:45.708
Hey!

1:08:45.791 --> 1:08:49.333
Don't sit on the presents.
They're papier-mâché. They'll break.

1:08:49.416 --> 1:08:50.750
What are you doing here?

1:08:51.250 --> 1:08:53.125
What kind of fairy are you?

1:08:53.208 --> 1:08:56.166
I'm the kind that appears
when you need them the most.

1:08:56.250 --> 1:09:00.500
I need you as much
as I need another Christmas.

1:09:00.583 --> 1:09:02.916
You need me to break the spell, Chuy.

1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:04.291
Well, then do it.

1:09:04.875 --> 1:09:07.541
You know what gets me the most?

1:09:07.625 --> 1:09:09.541
I've told you what you need to do,

1:09:09.625 --> 1:09:12.125
and you do everything except that.

1:09:12.208 --> 1:09:15.625
What are you talking about?
I did exactly what you asked me

1:09:16.250 --> 1:09:17.416
in all of your disguises.

1:09:17.500 --> 1:09:19.916
First, they're not disguises.

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:21.000
This is how I dress.

1:09:21.083 --> 1:09:23.166
What did I do to you?

1:09:23.250 --> 1:09:26.208
You did nothing to me,
but what about your family?

1:09:26.291 --> 1:09:28.208
You stole my family from me!

1:09:28.291 --> 1:09:30.333
What would I need them for?

1:09:30.416 --> 1:09:33.583
I can't imagine them working for me
as assistant elves.

1:09:33.666 --> 1:09:36.750
No, Chuy. You pushed them away yourself
before the spell.

1:09:36.833 --> 1:09:42.000
The spell was just to help you see
what would happen if you didn't change.

1:09:42.083 --> 1:09:44.791
You've spent the past Christmas Eves

1:09:44.875 --> 1:09:47.666
trying to undo the spell
instead of trying to change.

1:09:48.291 --> 1:09:49.250
Haven't I changed?

1:09:49.333 --> 1:09:51.666
Pretend this is a university,

1:09:51.750 --> 1:09:54.083
and the teacher asks you

1:09:54.166 --> 1:09:56.125
what grade you think you deserve.

1:09:56.208 --> 1:09:58.208
What would you give yourself? 100%?

1:09:58.291 --> 1:09:59.666
Maybe not 100%…

1:09:59.750 --> 1:10:00.625
90%?

1:10:02.166 --> 1:10:03.625
Well…

1:10:03.708 --> 1:10:05.000
80%?

1:10:05.083 --> 1:10:06.333
All right, 80%.

1:10:06.416 --> 1:10:09.750
Come on! 80%?

1:10:09.833 --> 1:10:11.166
Yes! I'd say so.

1:10:11.250 --> 1:10:14.208
Since I'm the teacher, I'd give you 50%.

1:10:14.291 --> 1:10:15.708
You'd flunk me?

1:10:15.791 --> 1:10:19.541
Yes! You are the worst student I've had
in my whole life.

1:10:19.625 --> 1:10:20.916
No, hold on.

1:10:21.875 --> 1:10:23.541
50% and 80%,

1:10:23.625 --> 1:10:24.458
that's 130.

1:10:24.958 --> 1:10:26.708
Divided by two, that's 65%.

1:10:26.791 --> 1:10:29.000
I pass! Barely, but I pass.

1:10:29.500 --> 1:10:34.166
Fine. Your logic works,
but you didn't learn anything.

1:10:34.250 --> 1:10:36.083
What? I did learn something.

1:10:36.583 --> 1:10:38.208
Please get me out of here.

1:10:38.291 --> 1:10:39.125
Okay.

1:10:39.208 --> 1:10:41.041
You'll stop reliving Christmas.

1:10:41.708 --> 1:10:43.416
But you're not going to like it.

1:10:44.625 --> 1:10:46.791
Are you removing the spell,

1:10:46.875 --> 1:10:48.833
or are you messing with me?

1:10:49.416 --> 1:10:50.250
Are you ready?

1:10:51.750 --> 1:10:55.125
Value your family in the present

1:10:55.208 --> 1:10:57.500
and in the future that awaits.

1:10:57.583 --> 1:10:59.666
Put yourself in other people's shoes.

1:11:00.416 --> 1:11:01.541
Okay.

1:11:01.625 --> 1:11:03.708
Christmas, oh Christmas,

1:11:04.333 --> 1:11:06.291
white Christmas.

1:11:06.375 --> 1:11:10.750
A day of happiness and joy.

1:11:11.375 --> 1:11:14.375
I will also sing on Christmas.

1:11:16.125 --> 1:11:16.958
Are you singing?

1:11:17.041 --> 1:11:18.416
Be quiet.

1:11:18.500 --> 1:11:21.708
North, south, east, west.

1:11:21.791 --> 1:11:23.708
Time's up.

1:11:24.291 --> 1:11:26.625
Abracadabra and…

1:11:43.625 --> 1:11:45.000
Thanks, Diva Godmother.

1:11:45.583 --> 1:11:47.000
IT'S NOT CHRISTMAS EVE ANYMORE…

1:11:47.083 --> 1:11:48.583
Neighbors! Long live love!

1:11:48.666 --> 1:11:50.833
-Good afternoon.
-Merry Christmas.

1:11:50.916 --> 1:11:51.833
Where's my car?

1:11:53.083 --> 1:11:54.958
Right, the leftovers dinner.

1:11:56.500 --> 1:11:57.500
Taxi!

1:11:59.500 --> 1:12:01.916
Thanks, Saúl.

1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.416
Take care! Merry Christmas!

1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:05.708
Merry Christmas, neighbor!

1:12:05.791 --> 1:12:06.666
Neighbor.

1:12:08.166 --> 1:12:10.666
Merry Christmas. Life's short, enjoy it!

1:12:11.250 --> 1:12:12.541
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

1:12:13.333 --> 1:12:14.666
Merry Christmas!

1:12:24.125 --> 1:12:25.000
Arturo, how nice!

1:12:25.083 --> 1:12:27.291
What are you doing here, Jesús?

1:12:27.375 --> 1:12:29.041
-What do you mean?
-Daniela!

1:12:29.125 --> 1:12:30.083
I'm here for dinner.

1:12:30.166 --> 1:12:31.000
Daniela!

1:12:32.833 --> 1:12:33.708
What is it?

1:12:33.791 --> 1:12:34.625
What?

1:12:34.708 --> 1:12:35.541
Sweetie.

1:12:36.041 --> 1:12:37.583
I broke the spell.

1:12:37.666 --> 1:12:38.833
Come, let's celebrate.

1:12:38.916 --> 1:12:40.958
No, Chuy. We have to talk.

1:12:41.541 --> 1:12:42.541
Okay.

1:12:44.083 --> 1:12:45.125
I talked to a lawyer.

1:12:46.958 --> 1:12:48.000
What?

1:12:48.625 --> 1:12:50.708
I made up my mind. I want a divorce.

1:12:52.208 --> 1:12:53.833
What do you mean, a divorce?

1:12:54.333 --> 1:12:55.333
I mean…

1:12:56.416 --> 1:12:58.041
Just like that? Overnight?

1:12:58.125 --> 1:13:00.250
It's not overnight, Jesús.

1:13:00.333 --> 1:13:01.958
I tried everything.

1:13:02.041 --> 1:13:04.625
I wanted this to work out, but it didn't.

1:13:04.708 --> 1:13:07.916
But I'm here now.

1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:10.541
You were focused on what you didn't have

1:13:10.625 --> 1:13:12.041
instead of what you had.

1:13:13.166 --> 1:13:14.791
You lost everything.

1:13:29.375 --> 1:13:30.375
It's over.

1:13:36.708 --> 1:13:38.125
What do you mean, it's over?

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:43.000
But…

1:13:45.500 --> 1:13:46.458
Daniela!

1:14:26.333 --> 1:14:29.958
Not like this, Diva Godmother.

1:14:51.625 --> 1:14:53.166
-Who is it?
-Chuy, Dad!

1:14:55.500 --> 1:14:57.208
-Son!
-Dad.

1:15:00.625 --> 1:15:01.791
What a surprise!

1:15:02.375 --> 1:15:03.208
Yeah.

1:15:03.708 --> 1:15:05.333
Leftovers got cancelled,

1:15:05.916 --> 1:15:08.375
so I decided to visit
my two favorite people.

1:15:11.625 --> 1:15:12.625
Two?

1:15:14.083 --> 1:15:15.666
-What?
-Come in.

1:15:30.416 --> 1:15:31.541
You were right.

1:15:33.083 --> 1:15:35.083
This really was your last year.

1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:40.041
My last words were
that I didn't like her cheese sauce.

1:15:41.208 --> 1:15:42.583
No, that wasn't all.

1:15:43.166 --> 1:15:45.500
You said a lot more.

1:15:47.083 --> 1:15:48.041
Yes, but…

1:15:51.708 --> 1:15:53.958
Why are you so sentimental right now?

1:15:54.833 --> 1:15:56.666
It's been more than ten months.

1:15:59.625 --> 1:16:01.291
Yeah, but

1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:04.375
this is our first Christmas without her.

1:16:09.458 --> 1:16:14.000
It's as if she dies
a few times throughout the year.

1:16:15.666 --> 1:16:16.666
That's true.

1:16:18.250 --> 1:16:20.375
I feel the same way.

1:16:23.291 --> 1:16:24.291
Every day.

1:16:45.041 --> 1:16:45.875
Wow.

1:16:48.041 --> 1:16:50.666
They love selling the idea
of a happy family.

1:16:51.583 --> 1:16:52.750
There's no such thing.

1:16:53.416 --> 1:16:55.166
Only because you're so bitter.

1:16:55.666 --> 1:16:58.500
You're always fighting with your siblings.

1:16:59.041 --> 1:17:01.416
Don't even mention my brother.

1:17:02.416 --> 1:17:05.291
You and Mom raised a real bum.

1:17:06.375 --> 1:17:07.416
No, we didn't.

1:17:07.500 --> 1:17:08.458
Yes, you did.

1:17:09.208 --> 1:17:12.625
I never understood
why you gave him the land.

1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:18.791
Assets are there to help in times of need.

1:17:19.916 --> 1:17:23.291
Don't you get
that your brother was completely broke?

1:17:23.375 --> 1:17:25.083
I couldn't leave him on the street.

1:17:25.166 --> 1:17:27.583
The land was for whoever needed it.

1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:30.583
He was in a bad situation.

1:17:31.416 --> 1:17:34.333
I'm not his boss, I'm his dad.

1:17:35.458 --> 1:17:36.833
I also needed a dad.

1:17:37.708 --> 1:17:41.166
Remember all the times
you forgot my birthday.

1:17:41.250 --> 1:17:43.583
What? Why that face?

1:17:43.666 --> 1:17:45.750
Remember when I was six?

1:17:45.833 --> 1:17:48.958
That day you all forgot my birthday.

1:17:49.875 --> 1:17:52.458
The whole day went by
and no one remembered.

1:17:52.541 --> 1:17:55.166
And of course, when I cried at dinner,

1:17:55.250 --> 1:17:56.833
you all suddenly remembered.

1:17:57.333 --> 1:18:01.416
As a consolation,
you gave me this old watch.

1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:03.041
I don't even like it.

1:18:04.833 --> 1:18:06.541
You love playing the victim.

1:18:06.625 --> 1:18:09.166
If that is your problem, you're blessed.

1:18:10.708 --> 1:18:13.625
And if you don't like the watch,
don't wear it.

1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:25.416
DECEMBER 26

1:18:34.041 --> 1:18:35.166
What's up, Conrado?

1:18:35.708 --> 1:18:38.250
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>You were supposed to be here at 7:00.</i>

1:18:46.500 --> 1:18:48.208
Welcome to iMasters.

1:19:07.041 --> 1:19:08.041
Hello, sweetie.

1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:10.458
Want to have dinner with me?

1:19:10.541 --> 1:19:12.083
<i>No, Dad. Call my brother.</i>

1:19:13.500 --> 1:19:15.083
Your brother isn't answering.

1:19:15.166 --> 1:19:17.500
<i>Then call Mom and fix things.</i>

1:19:44.500 --> 1:19:46.541
Excuse me, how much are these?

1:19:46.625 --> 1:19:48.000
One hundred pesos, sir.

1:19:48.500 --> 1:19:50.000
Can I have them?

1:19:50.083 --> 1:19:51.250
Sure, they're very pretty.

1:19:51.333 --> 1:19:55.125
DECEMBER 27

1:19:57.333 --> 1:19:59.583
SILVIA ESPINOZA
THOSE WHO KNEW YOU, LOVED YOU.

1:19:59.666 --> 1:20:00.708
Hi, Mom.

1:20:02.958 --> 1:20:04.416
You left too soon.

1:20:09.458 --> 1:20:10.291
Forgive me.

1:20:14.750 --> 1:20:17.083
For not being patient with you…

1:20:20.541 --> 1:20:22.500
For losing my temper…

1:20:27.500 --> 1:20:29.041
You were such a good mom.

1:20:34.083 --> 1:20:35.416
Forgive me because…

1:20:37.375 --> 1:20:41.916
although my family might be a bunch
of freeloaders that always fights,

1:20:43.916 --> 1:20:45.416
they're also very loving.

1:20:56.416 --> 1:20:57.583
I am very blessed.

1:21:02.125 --> 1:21:05.000
I wish you were here

1:21:06.416 --> 1:21:09.541
so I could eat your turkey
and cheese sauce.

1:21:15.541 --> 1:21:16.541
I miss you.

1:21:26.500 --> 1:21:28.458
<i>Is everything okay? Your call worried me.</i>

1:21:28.541 --> 1:21:30.166
It sounded urgent.

1:21:31.166 --> 1:21:32.750
-I know.
-Everything okay?

1:21:32.833 --> 1:21:39.000
I've been thinking about all of our fights
and our differences,

1:21:39.708 --> 1:21:41.791
and because of Mom,

1:21:42.500 --> 1:21:44.791
I think we should amend the will

1:21:45.708 --> 1:21:47.541
and the deed to the plot of land.

1:21:47.625 --> 1:21:48.458
Okay.

1:21:49.041 --> 1:21:50.375
What are you thinking?

1:21:50.458 --> 1:21:53.000
Should we put it under both of our names

1:21:53.625 --> 1:21:54.625
or just yours?

1:21:55.916 --> 1:21:57.916
I think it should be under your name.

1:21:59.083 --> 1:22:00.458
You'll make better use of it.

1:22:02.208 --> 1:22:03.750
-Really?
-Really.

1:22:36.833 --> 1:22:41.500
DECEMBER 28

1:22:47.500 --> 1:22:48.875
Oh, Chuy.

1:23:06.041 --> 1:23:07.041
Hello.

1:23:08.541 --> 1:23:10.000
I'd like to speak to Daniela.

1:23:10.083 --> 1:23:13.333
My apologies,
but she told us not to let you in.

1:23:14.041 --> 1:23:15.208
Please, it's important.

1:23:15.291 --> 1:23:17.250
I can't let you in.

1:23:17.333 --> 1:23:19.666
Please help me, I need to talk to her.

1:23:19.750 --> 1:23:21.291
I can't. She said no.

1:23:28.875 --> 1:23:31.833
Girls, can you give us a minute, please?

1:23:33.791 --> 1:23:34.625
Thanks.

1:23:36.791 --> 1:23:37.791
Thanks.

1:23:38.500 --> 1:23:40.125
I'm here.

1:23:41.875 --> 1:23:42.875
What's that?

1:23:44.125 --> 1:23:45.000
It's for you.

1:23:45.666 --> 1:23:46.958
I always call you Bunny.

1:23:48.166 --> 1:23:50.041
That's right. Thanks.

1:23:51.916 --> 1:23:52.916
Daniela, forgive me.

1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:54.958
Forgive me, even for a moment.

1:23:55.041 --> 1:23:56.958
"Forgive me." Those are just words.

1:23:57.041 --> 1:23:58.750
What do I do with that?

1:23:58.833 --> 1:24:01.041
I know, but that's all I have right now.

1:24:01.625 --> 1:24:03.583
And deep regret.

1:24:04.791 --> 1:24:05.625
Honestly.

1:24:07.625 --> 1:24:08.458
Chuy.

1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.625
I got tired of having to convince you

1:24:13.791 --> 1:24:17.125
that I was capable of doing something.

1:24:17.208 --> 1:24:18.291
Forgive me.

1:24:19.166 --> 1:24:22.916
I'm so proud of you
and everything you've achieved.

1:24:23.916 --> 1:24:26.208
I love that you're fulfilling your dreams.

1:24:26.833 --> 1:24:28.791
You're completely right.

1:24:31.166 --> 1:24:32.041
I had it all,

1:24:32.916 --> 1:24:33.791
and I lost it.

1:24:35.333 --> 1:24:36.458
The only thing I want is

1:24:37.375 --> 1:24:39.083
to have dinner with you guys.

1:24:39.833 --> 1:24:42.208
To have a Christmas dinner together.

1:24:42.291 --> 1:24:44.666
You? You want a Christmas dinner?

1:24:45.250 --> 1:24:46.250
Yes.

1:24:53.166 --> 1:24:54.291
Óscar won't want to.

1:24:55.083 --> 1:24:56.041
Why not?

1:24:56.125 --> 1:24:59.416
After the scene you made
when he came out of the closet?

1:24:59.500 --> 1:25:02.916
I doubt it.
No wonder he didn't call on your birthday.

1:25:05.083 --> 1:25:06.333
Do you know where he is?

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:17.000
Son!

1:25:17.791 --> 1:25:18.791
Óscar!

1:25:19.375 --> 1:25:22.583
-I need to talk to you.
-What are you doing here?

1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:25.583
I want to apologize.

1:25:26.333 --> 1:25:27.791
Apologize for what?

1:25:28.500 --> 1:25:30.125
For everything!

1:25:30.208 --> 1:25:31.166
No, Dad.

1:25:31.666 --> 1:25:33.750
You need to try harder than that.

1:25:34.416 --> 1:25:35.416
Apologize for what?

1:25:36.333 --> 1:25:40.500
I hear I didn't react very well
when you told me what you told me.

1:25:40.583 --> 1:25:41.416
You hear?

1:25:41.916 --> 1:25:43.500
What did I tell you?

1:25:44.958 --> 1:25:46.041
Forgive me, son.

1:25:47.583 --> 1:25:49.166
I didn't react well

1:25:50.041 --> 1:25:51.416
when you told me you're gay.

1:25:53.500 --> 1:25:55.791
And you were going to live
with your boyfriend.

1:25:55.875 --> 1:25:59.000
You wanted to drag me to a strip club.

1:25:59.625 --> 1:26:02.541
And then you cried
in front of the entire restaurant.

1:26:02.625 --> 1:26:05.166
Why would you tell me at a restaurant?

1:26:05.250 --> 1:26:07.458
So you wouldn't make a scene!

1:26:07.541 --> 1:26:10.916
You should have known better. You know me!

1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.041
-This is your apology?
-No.

1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:15.166
I mean, yes.

1:26:15.916 --> 1:26:16.916
You spent

1:26:18.166 --> 1:26:19.416
a lifetime

1:26:19.500 --> 1:26:21.500
trying to turn me into somebody I wasn't.

1:26:22.416 --> 1:26:23.958
Focusing on everything I lacked.

1:26:24.041 --> 1:26:25.625
That's why I'm here, son.

1:26:27.416 --> 1:26:28.791
To tell you that I see you.

1:26:29.416 --> 1:26:30.875
I value who you are.

1:26:32.083 --> 1:26:33.333
I love you, son!

1:26:33.833 --> 1:26:35.250
Forgive me!

1:26:38.416 --> 1:26:40.541
What are you doing? No, wait. Son!

1:26:41.791 --> 1:26:42.666
Son!

1:27:07.625 --> 1:27:08.750
I'm sorry, son.

1:27:16.250 --> 1:27:17.708
I love you too, Dad.

1:27:20.541 --> 1:27:21.500
This is Tommy.

1:27:22.125 --> 1:27:23.375
Hello, Father-in-law.

1:27:23.875 --> 1:27:25.291
Nice to meet you, Tommy.

1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:36.083
I'd like to have Christmas dinner.

1:27:41.291 --> 1:27:42.125
Why are you here?

1:27:43.250 --> 1:27:45.208
We're making Christmas dinner.

1:27:45.291 --> 1:27:49.583
What are you talking about?
Christmas is over.

1:27:49.666 --> 1:27:53.083
I know, but we want to celebrate with you.

1:27:53.166 --> 1:27:58.083
Thanks, but I'm not hungry
and I'm not in the mood.

1:27:58.166 --> 1:27:59.833
That's exactly why.

1:27:59.916 --> 1:28:01.375
We're all here.

1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:05.000
No matter what happens,
we'll always be a family.

1:28:05.083 --> 1:28:06.666
Come, join us for dinner.

1:28:07.916 --> 1:28:08.916
Come on.

1:28:13.583 --> 1:28:15.125
It's last minute…

1:28:15.958 --> 1:28:17.875
I want to say a few words.

1:28:19.291 --> 1:28:20.500
And to make a toast

1:28:20.583 --> 1:28:22.750
for us being here

1:28:23.666 --> 1:28:25.083
at this Christmas dinner

1:28:25.875 --> 1:28:27.125
that I wanted so much.

1:28:27.208 --> 1:28:29.750
I know it's not Christmas anymore,
but thank you.

1:28:29.833 --> 1:28:34.250
Thanks, Dad, brother,
for being here with us.

1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.291
And to everyone
for making this dinner possible.

1:28:37.375 --> 1:28:38.291
Thank you.

1:28:38.375 --> 1:28:39.375
Cheers.

1:28:41.416 --> 1:28:43.416
<i>For being here with us.</i>

1:28:43.500 --> 1:28:46.333
<i>And to everyone</i>
<i>for making this dinner possible.</i>

1:28:46.416 --> 1:28:49.458
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1:28:49.541 --> 1:28:51.250
-Tommy, nice to have you.
-Thank you.

1:28:51.333 --> 1:28:54.958
-He did it!
-He did it!

1:28:56.125 --> 1:28:58.083
She's watching down from heaven.

1:28:59.083 --> 1:29:02.250
He did it!

1:29:07.291 --> 1:29:10.250
He did it!

1:29:10.333 --> 1:29:12.458
-What's going on?
-He did it!

1:29:12.541 --> 1:29:13.750
Let's see.

1:29:20.166 --> 1:29:22.541
Finally! Are you ready?

1:29:22.625 --> 1:29:24.083
Yes!

1:29:24.833 --> 1:29:26.833
I miss Mom so much.

1:29:31.625 --> 1:29:32.708
Enjoy the food, Dad.

1:29:34.375 --> 1:29:35.333
What's that?

1:29:36.500 --> 1:29:38.041
-What?
-Today's the 28th.

1:30:03.833 --> 1:30:04.666
Dad.

1:30:05.833 --> 1:30:07.958
Can I change my letter to Santa Claus?

1:30:12.833 --> 1:30:15.416
Come on! Please, Daddy.

1:30:16.958 --> 1:30:17.958
Yes, my love.

1:30:18.916 --> 1:30:20.041
I heard you.

1:30:21.708 --> 1:30:23.125
Of course we can change it.

1:30:23.625 --> 1:30:25.708
I also want to change mine.

1:30:26.916 --> 1:30:27.750
You do, champ?

1:30:31.916 --> 1:30:34.916
Kids, I hope you wished your dad
a happy birthday.

1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:42.000
<i>Happy birthday to you…</i>

1:30:46.500 --> 1:30:49.708
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, BIRTHDAY BOY!

1:30:56.500 --> 1:31:00.541
<i>Once, a friend told me</i>
<i>to enjoy life's crumbs.</i>

1:31:00.625 --> 1:31:03.666
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if that was days or years ago.</i>

1:31:04.750 --> 1:31:05.875
<i>I was different then.</i>

1:31:05.958 --> 1:31:08.125
-What's up?
-Spare some change.

1:31:08.208 --> 1:31:09.166
Some change?

1:31:09.250 --> 1:31:10.666
What about a job?

1:31:10.750 --> 1:31:12.875
-Know how to clean windows? Get in!
-Okay.

1:31:31.583 --> 1:31:35.166
<i>I couldn't value the people</i>
<i>who love me and put up with me.</i>

1:31:36.458 --> 1:31:38.166
Want to be my business partner?

1:31:39.916 --> 1:31:41.500
-Business partner?
-Partner!

1:31:45.541 --> 1:31:48.583
<i>I thought Christmas was a farce,</i>

1:31:48.666 --> 1:31:51.541
<i>when everyone</i>
<i>was filled with love and cheer,</i>

1:31:52.250 --> 1:31:54.541
<i>and then forgot all about it the next day.</i>

1:31:54.625 --> 1:31:56.250
Cheez Whiz!

1:31:56.333 --> 1:31:58.083
<i>If I learned anything,</i>

1:31:58.166 --> 1:32:01.916
<i>is that it's not just Christmas Day</i>
<i>that's important,</i>

1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:05.875
<i>but also the days that follow it.</i>

1:32:14.208 --> 1:32:16.958
<i>I know</i>
<i>what a life of indifference is like.</i>

1:32:17.625 --> 1:32:19.250
<i>I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.</i>

1:32:20.333 --> 1:32:22.208
<i>Christmas is a time</i>

1:32:22.291 --> 1:32:24.875
<i>to hug those that are close to us</i>,

1:32:24.958 --> 1:32:27.333
<i>and to remember those who are far away.</i>

1:32:29.083 --> 1:32:33.000
<i>And despite the nonsense</i>
<i>you heard me say before,</i>

1:32:33.083 --> 1:32:36.791
<i>the world is a place of kindness.</i>

1:32:36.875 --> 1:32:40.666
<i>Happy birthday to you…</i>

1:32:40.750 --> 1:32:42.916
<i>But I'm sure you already know that.</i>

1:32:58.250 --> 1:32:59.291
Where are you going?

1:32:59.375 --> 1:33:01.291
-To the leftovers dinner.
-Can I come?

1:33:02.500 --> 1:33:03.500
Really?

1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:49.000
