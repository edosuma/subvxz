00:42.961 --> 00:43.961
Hello?

00:43.962 --> 00:45.879
Steve?
Yeah.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.839
Who's this?
It's Rob.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.174
Oh, hey.
Hey.

00:49.175 --> 00:50.842
How are you?

00:50.843 --> 00:52.386
Good.
How-how are you?

00:52.387 --> 00:54.846
Yeah, good.
How is the show going?

00:54.847 --> 00:56.682
Uh, just finished.
Just starting the hiatus.

00:56.683 --> 00:57.724
Yeah, I know.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.768
I-I spoke to your agent.

00:59.769 --> 01:02.396
Listen, The Observer wants us
to do more restaurant reviews,

01:02.397 --> 01:04.063
another six lunches.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.108
Really?
But this time in Italy.

01:06.109 --> 01:08.485
Ma belle Italia, yeah?

01:08.486 --> 01:10.988
Beautiful countryside,
beautiful wine,

01:10.989 --> 01:13.574
beautiful women,
beautiful food.

01:13.575 --> 01:14.700
What do you think?

01:14.701 --> 01:16.201
Well, um...

01:16.202 --> 01:17.327
And they'll fly you
to Europe.

01:17.328 --> 01:18.745
First class?

01:18.746 --> 01:21.833
Or business
or upper-class Virgin.

01:27.672 --> 01:29.798
This is according to
The Observer.

01:29.799 --> 01:32.217
Nowhere in Italy
compares with Piemonte

01:32.218 --> 01:35.429
for travelers looking for
a combination of fine wines,

01:35.430 --> 01:37.681
gastronomy,
and beautiful countryside.

01:37.682 --> 01:39.224
The area to explore

01:39.225 --> 01:41.018
is just an hour's drive
down the autostrada

01:41.019 --> 01:44.605
â€œfrom Turin, from Bra,
through Alba, then Asti,

01:44.606 --> 01:46.815
takes you through
a panoply of vineyards

01:46.816 --> 01:49.443
producing Italy's greatest
red wines:

01:49.444 --> 01:52.738
Barolo, Barbarasco, Barbara.

01:52.739 --> 01:54.406
Hanna-Barbara.

01:54.407 --> 01:56.116
Sufferin' succotash!

01:56.117 --> 01:58.243
I thought I thaw a puddy tat!

01:58.244 --> 02:00.037
I did!
Pbbt!

02:00.038 --> 02:02.247
The Trattoria della Pasta

02:02.248 --> 02:03.832
uh, which is where
we're going

02:03.833 --> 02:06.043
is set in rolling hills
clad with vineyards.

02:06.044 --> 02:08.461
This elegant trattoria
is the ideal place

02:08.463 --> 02:10.088
for a romantic evening.

02:10.089 --> 02:12.049
You know I'm not a homosexual,
don't you?

02:12.050 --> 02:14.384
No, we're not having
a romantic evening.

02:14.385 --> 02:16.470
We are gonna have
a stimulating lunch.

02:16.471 --> 02:17.804
Good.
Good.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.806
And if romance should occur,

02:19.807 --> 02:21.600
we'll deal with it
as it happens.

02:21.601 --> 02:23.226
The only time
I'd ever snuggle up to you

02:23.227 --> 02:26.271
is if I was on the side
of the Eiger, on a shelf,

02:26.272 --> 02:28.273
and not to do so
would mean I'd freeze to death.

02:28.274 --> 02:29.483
Well, in that situation,

02:29.484 --> 02:30.776
you know
what you're meant to do.

02:30.777 --> 02:32.611
You're meant to get as close
to each other as you can.

02:32.612 --> 02:33.945
I know.
You have to spoon.

02:33.946 --> 02:35.489
Spooning, yeah, yeah.
I know.

02:35.490 --> 02:37.366
Can wee on each other as well,
and that's.

02:37.367 --> 02:40.577
Well, that's where recreation
meets survival, isn't it?

02:40.578 --> 02:41.662
Yeah.

02:41.663 --> 02:45.916
I've also sorted out the music,
the iPod.

02:45.917 --> 02:48.877
I've gone for a
a broad selection,

02:48.878 --> 02:50.087
a lot of Italian stuff,

02:50.088 --> 02:52.089
a lot of, um, opera,
obviously.

02:52.090 --> 02:53.507
Good. Good.
Don Giovanni.

02:53.508 --> 02:54.966
Rigoletto...

02:54.967 --> 02:56.510
Uh, Verdi.

02:56.511 --> 02:58.970
Then a smattering of Wales
and the Welsh

02:58.971 --> 03:00.806
to tie in
with the beautiful countryside.

03:00.807 --> 03:03.100
Right, Verdi's sounding
very, very appealing

03:03.101 --> 03:04.726
right now,
I have to say.

03:04.727 --> 03:06.770
I've got some Stereophonics
and some Tom

03:06.771 --> 03:08.605
Jones.

03:08.606 --> 03:10.315
We're not gonna be doing
any impersonations, are we?

03:10.316 --> 03:11.983
Because we talked about that.
No.

03:11.984 --> 03:15.320
If I sing along,
that's not an impersonation.

03:15.321 --> 03:19.324
It just so happens
I bear an uncanny resemblance,

03:19.325 --> 03:21.576
vocally and physically,
to Tom.

03:21.577 --> 03:23.578
What'?
'Cause you look 75?

03:23.579 --> 03:25.163
Why is this.

03:25.164 --> 03:27.165
Ohh!

03:27.166 --> 03:29.668
I promise you I haven't
sabotaged the sound system

03:29.669 --> 03:34.005
because of my aversion
to your karaoke inclination.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.217
Why is
there's nothing at all.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.350
Mmm!

03:45.351 --> 03:47.269
Bone.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.270
That's actually.

03:48.271 --> 03:50.063
That is-that is nice.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.149
I'll take your word for it.

03:52.150 --> 03:54.067
No, no, no, no.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.319
Grazie.
Grazie.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.529
Seriously?

03:57.530 --> 03:58.989
You're not drinking?
No.

03:58.990 --> 04:00.449
When did this come about?

04:00.450 --> 04:02.909
I've not drunk
for about nine months.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.746
So you're not gonna drink
at all on the trip?

04:05.747 --> 04:06.789
Wow.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.714
I'm surprised The Observer
wanted you to do this again.

04:15.715 --> 04:17.007
I mean...
Well...

04:17.007 --> 04:18.216
Neither of us
know anything about

04:18.216 --> 04:20.177
with respect-know anything
about food, really.

04:20.178 --> 04:21.845
I know a little bit
about food.

04:21.846 --> 04:23.096
Well, yeah, but you don't.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.431
But when I wrote
the last ones,

04:24.432 --> 04:26.224
I concentrated
not so much on the food.

04:26.225 --> 04:28.393
It was more a journey.
It was the culture.

04:28.394 --> 04:30.979
It was-it was Wordsworth
and Coleridge.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.898
Now it's gonna be Byron
and Shelley.

04:32.899 --> 04:35.066
It just feels odd doing
something for a second time.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.818
You know, it's like
second album syndrome, isn't it?

04:36.819 --> 04:40.155
Everyone has this amazing,
expressive first album,

04:40.156 --> 04:41.364
where they
put everything into it,

04:41.365 --> 04:43.241
and the second album's
a bit of a damp squib.

04:43.242 --> 04:44.576
It's like trying to do a sequel,
isn't it?

04:44.577 --> 04:45.952
It's never gonna be
as good as the first time.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.370
Godfather II.

04:47.371 --> 04:49.122
Which is the one
that people always mention

04:49.123 --> 04:50.624
when they try to search
for an example

04:50.625 --> 04:52.125
of a sequel
that's as good as...

04:52.126 --> 04:53.627
Just when I thought I was out,

04:53.628 --> 04:55.462
they pull me back in.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.464
What's this licking thing
you always do?

04:57.465 --> 04:58.882
You look like some sort of...

04:58.883 --> 05:00.175
It's what Pacino does.

05:00.176 --> 05:01.259
Small gecko.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.303
That's what he does.

05:03.304 --> 05:04.805
Just when I thought

05:04.806 --> 05:06.014
I'd made two

05:06.015 --> 05:07.808
terrific movies,

05:07.809 --> 05:11.311
they go and make another!

05:11.312 --> 05:13.063
I'm back in.

05:13.064 --> 05:14.898
It's okay; He's just doing
an impersonation.

05:14.899 --> 05:15.942
It's fine.

05:17.193 --> 05:18.568
Look at Byron.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.654
You know,
Childe Hamid made him

05:20.655 --> 05:24.074
the most popular poet
in all of Europe,

05:24.075 --> 05:26.618
and when he wrote that, he did
the first two cantos, right?

05:26.619 --> 05:29.246
And he said, if this is a hit,
I'll write more.

05:29.247 --> 05:31.998
If it's not a hit,
I won't do any more.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.209
You should do the same
at the end of your shows

05:34.210 --> 05:35.877
promise the audience
you won't do any more

05:35.878 --> 05:37.128
if they don't like it.

05:37.129 --> 05:40.424
At the end of my successful
tours and live shows?

05:47.390 --> 05:48.682
Oh.
Okay.

05:48.683 --> 05:50.684
Oh, gosh.

05:50.685 --> 05:52.978
Grazie.

05:52.979 --> 05:55.772
Grazia
PregoBuon appetite.

05:55.773 --> 05:57.608
Grazie.
Molto grazie.

05:59.861 --> 06:00.861
Mmm.

06:00.862 --> 06:02.280
That is lovely.

06:04.073 --> 06:05.282
Childe Harold,

06:05.283 --> 06:08.410
Byron wrote, was a thinly veiled
self-portrait.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.661
I was aware of that.

06:09.662 --> 06:11.288
Thought we could do
a similar thing with you,

06:11.289 --> 06:12.581
Childe Stephen,

06:12.582 --> 06:14.249
follow you
on your travels and.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.584
Well, it wouldn't be
a pseudonym, would it?

06:15.585 --> 06:16.918
'Cause I'm called Stephen.

06:16.919 --> 06:18.295
Byron wasn't called Harold.

06:18.296 --> 06:20.171
No.
Was he?

06:20.172 --> 06:24.593
He was actually
George Gordon Lord Byron.

06:24.594 --> 06:25.760
Gordon.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.679
Understandably, he, um.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.722
Ditched the Gordon.

06:28.723 --> 06:29.890
He ditched the Gordon.

06:29.891 --> 06:31.474
It's not a romantic name.

06:31.475 --> 06:32.893
It's not a poet's name,
Gordon, no.

06:32.894 --> 06:34.144
It's not.

06:34.145 --> 06:35.520
Gordon Byron on line three.

06:35.521 --> 06:37.105
Oh, God,
tell him I'm not in.

06:37.106 --> 06:39.942
He does my head in.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.237
So Childe Stephen
we'll do it as an article,

06:44.238 --> 06:47.115
turn it into a Sunday night
serial on BBC One.

06:47.116 --> 06:48.700
Who plays you?

06:48.701 --> 06:50.911
A Sunday night costume drama
about my life?

06:50.912 --> 06:52.037
Yeah.
Who plays you?

06:52.038 --> 06:53.038
It could happen.

06:53.039 --> 06:54.497
Who plays you?

06:54.498 --> 06:55.999
Play myself.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.542
You couldn't do that.
It's childe.

06:57.543 --> 06:59.336
It's meant to be
like a young man.

06:59.337 --> 07:00.837
You could have Jude Law.

07:00.838 --> 07:03.340
Jude Law's 40-plus.

07:03.341 --> 07:04.674
He doesn't look it,
does he?

07:04.675 --> 07:05.842
He hasn't aged like you and I.

07:05.843 --> 07:06.927
Well, he's balding.

07:06.928 --> 07:08.553
Yeah, but he's got that face,
he does.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.681
He's got that really young
bald look.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.479
When you played
Alan Partridge

07:17.480 --> 07:19.648
you know,
when he was popular

07:19.649 --> 07:22.108
you-he was more known
than you.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.693
And, of course,
he was older than you.

07:23.694 --> 07:25.320
But with me,
with The Rob Brydon Show,

07:25.321 --> 07:26.488
my name is in the title.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.490
I sort of push that.
Yeah.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.116
If I were in a bar in a hotel
in Britain, right,

07:30.117 --> 07:31.701
and I wanted to have a drink
with a girl,

07:31.702 --> 07:33.078
I couldn't do it,
'cause there would be

07:33.079 --> 07:34.579
an assumption
Oh, what's he doing?

07:34.580 --> 07:36.122
Go and chat to Rob Brydon?
Yeah.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.123
People think I'm affable.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.124
Affable.
That's what I.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.335
Well, you are.
I'm affable. I'm affable.

07:40.336 --> 07:42.087
I'm not disagreeing with you.
I'm an affable man.

07:42.088 --> 07:43.380
I'm not disagreeing with you.

07:43.381 --> 07:44.965
But my public persona

07:44.966 --> 07:47.384
is even more affable
than I actually am.

07:47.385 --> 07:49.386
I'm not as affable
as people think I am.

07:49.387 --> 07:51.221
You've made an affable rod
for your own back.

07:51.222 --> 07:52.347
Yes.

07:52.348 --> 07:54.891
Yes, and I'm not saying
I'm not affable.

07:54.892 --> 07:56.393
I am affable.

07:56.394 --> 07:57.394
We're agreed there.

07:57.395 --> 07:59.020
But I'm not as affable

07:59.021 --> 08:00.438
as perhaps I've given people
cause to think.

08:00.439 --> 08:01.731
Crystal clear.

08:01.732 --> 08:05.443
So out here,
I can be off the leash.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.320
I can-l can let my hair

08:07.321 --> 08:08.488
what is left of it
down.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.698
Yeah.

08:09.699 --> 08:12.201
And, you know,
have a good time.

08:16.914 --> 08:17.915
Oh, lovely.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.252
Mmm.

08:23.629 --> 08:26.548
Grazie mille.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.258
Buon appetite.

08:28.259 --> 08:30.218
Grazie.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.429
You know, there's a publisher
who is very interested

08:32.429 --> 08:34.264
in putting these articles
into a book,

08:34.265 --> 08:35.472
a Christmas stocking book.

08:35.474 --> 08:36.725
How do they think
they're gonna

08:36.726 --> 08:38.308
get six articles
and turn it into a book'?

08:38.309 --> 08:40.937
Well, we would also do
the ones from the Lake District,

08:40.938 --> 08:42.397
from the English ones.

08:42.398 --> 08:43.606
What did you think of them?

08:43.607 --> 08:46.067
I didn't read them.
I was in America, acting.

08:46.068 --> 08:48.862
They were
a lightly fictionalized account

08:48.863 --> 08:52.657
of your adventures
in the north of England.

08:52.658 --> 08:54.576
How were they
lightly fictionalized?

08:54.577 --> 08:55.994
The names were changed to.

08:55.995 --> 08:57.704
What about my name?

08:57.705 --> 08:59.456
We kept your name, but
the girls' names were changed.

08:59.457 --> 09:01.124
So how do they know
it's fictionalized if it says

09:01.125 --> 09:03.418
Steve Coogan's Adventures
in the Lake District?

09:03.419 --> 09:05.545
Did you say, ?

09:05.546 --> 09:06.713
No?

09:06.714 --> 09:08.923
Not in the traditional sense.
No, no.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.760
But then I did do the work
for you, didn't I?

09:16.182 --> 09:17.348
Mmm.

09:17.349 --> 09:18.725
Bellissimo.

09:18.726 --> 09:19.726
What do you think
on the mini, then?

09:19.727 --> 09:20.727
You enjoying it?

09:20.728 --> 09:22.228
Rmi
I'm pleasantly surprised.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.438
It's a nice car.

09:23.439 --> 09:25.440
And to drive it in Italy...

09:25.441 --> 09:27.442
Yeah?

09:27.443 --> 09:29.027
What'?
You see what I'm getting at.

09:29.028 --> 09:31.446
Yeah, The Italian Job.
Exactly, yeah.

09:31.447 --> 09:32.447
I was wondering
whether you'd actually

09:32.448 --> 09:33.490
booked the mini in Italy...

09:33.491 --> 09:34.491
Well...

09:34.492 --> 09:35.575
The Italian Job,

09:35.576 --> 09:37.494
just to give you
the opportunity to say...

09:37.495 --> 09:39.245
You're only supposed to

09:39.246 --> 09:40.747
blow the bloody doors off!

09:40.748 --> 09:42.207
But I've done it now,

09:42.208 --> 09:44.501
so hopefully
that'll be an end to it.

09:44.502 --> 09:47.670
Do your Michael Cains.

09:47.671 --> 09:50.298
Did you see him
in The Dark Knight Rises?

09:50.299 --> 09:51.716
And his voice

09:51.717 --> 09:53.301
gets even more emotional

09:53.302 --> 09:55.095
than it's ever done in the past
before.

09:55.096 --> 09:56.846
I don't want to bury you,
Batman.

09:56.847 --> 10:00.225
I will not put you
into the ground in a little box.

10:00.226 --> 10:02.644
I will not do it, Master Bruce.
I will not do it.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.896
I'm not
gonna bury another Batman.

10:04.897 --> 10:05.897
Another Batman?

10:05.898 --> 10:07.107
How many Batmans
has he been burying?

10:07.108 --> 10:08.191
How many are there?

10:08.192 --> 10:09.734
I've buried 14 Batmen so far.

10:09.735 --> 10:10.902
I've buried 14 Batmen.

10:10.903 --> 10:12.403
Their little pointy ears
into the box.

10:12.404 --> 10:15.824
I'm not gonna bury another
nylon cloak with pointy ears

10:15.825 --> 10:18.409
that people wear
at birthday parties.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.245
With the little belt
the very wide belt

10:20.246 --> 10:22.997
that is flattering
to a man with an expanded girth.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.582
I won't do that to you,
Master Bruce.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.209
I will not do it to you.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.878
And I won't make the voice
like that.

10:28.879 --> 10:31.339
The voice
goes even more like that.

10:31.340 --> 10:33.091
He's basically yodeling.

10:33.092 --> 10:36.136
Yodel-ay-he-hoo!

10:36.137 --> 10:37.804
And then Christian Bale says...

10:37.805 --> 10:39.389
You wanted to see me.

10:39.390 --> 10:41.015
And when he says that
like this,

10:41.016 --> 10:43.017
he puts his tongue
up in front.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.561
I don't want to be a madman.

10:44.562 --> 10:46.563
I don't want to be
a normal guy.

10:46.564 --> 10:47.773
You sound deaf.

10:49.775 --> 10:51.651
It's so nobody
can recognize him.

10:51.652 --> 10:52.902
I can't understand

10:52.903 --> 10:54.362
a word you're saying,
Master Bruce.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.364
Talk to me as Master Bruce,
not as Batman.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.575
Why-why does he.

10:58.576 --> 11:00.451
So he can have
the cloak of anonymity.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.078
But he doesn't sound
you said,

11:02.079 --> 11:03.997
Here's that bloke in the cloak
with the

11:03.998 --> 11:05.623
who sounds
like he's deaf again,

11:05.624 --> 11:07.041
that is not anonymous, is it?

11:07.042 --> 11:08.835
I'm deaf hero.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.587
No wonder when Batman arrives
and starts speaking like that,

11:10.588 --> 11:12.130
everyone starts
looking at their shoes.

11:12.131 --> 11:13.506
'Cause they're all thinking,

11:13.507 --> 11:14.924
Oh, God,
why does he talk like that?

11:14.925 --> 11:16.509
Poor fella.
You know?

11:16.510 --> 11:19.345
And what about Tom Hardy
as Bane?

11:19.346 --> 11:21.055
Did you catch a single word?

11:21.056 --> 11:22.682
They're, like, competing

11:22.683 --> 11:25.143
to see who's the most
the least understandable.

11:25.144 --> 11:26.352
Bane, you're never
gonna beat me.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.563
You'll never beat me.

11:32.318 --> 11:34.235
Wind.

11:34.236 --> 11:35.737
Take off your mask, love.

11:35.738 --> 11:36.988
I can't catch a word
you're saying.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.114
Oh!

11:38.115 --> 11:39.366
I was saying.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.036
He's a wonderful actor.
Don't get me wrong.

11:43.037 --> 11:44.120
No, he's very good.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.205
Tom Hardy's
very, very muscular,

11:45.206 --> 11:46.414
so he's a terrific actor.

11:46.415 --> 11:47.957
No, he's a bit-he's good.

11:47.958 --> 11:50.169
He's scary good, scarily good.
But...

11:54.048 --> 11:56.299
I don't-l don't

11:56.300 --> 11:58.009
I don't-do you know
what I think that is?

11:58.010 --> 12:01.387
I think that they both
are very formidable actors...

12:01.388 --> 12:03.181
Yes.
Very charismatic...

12:03.182 --> 12:04.265
Yes.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.850
A little bit scary.
Yes.

12:05.851 --> 12:07.477
Can you imagine a first A.D.
going up to one of them,

12:07.478 --> 12:09.229
going,
Um, the director thinks

12:09.230 --> 12:10.772
he can't quite understand
what you're saying.

12:10.773 --> 12:11.981
Do you want to try
a different voice?

12:11.982 --> 12:12.982
What did he say?

12:12.983 --> 12:14.192
Do you want to try
a different voice?

12:14.193 --> 12:15.193
Oh, certainly not.

12:15.194 --> 12:16.569
The director's
just a little bit worried

12:16.570 --> 12:18.690
that maybe people can't
understand what you're saying.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.825
Stick your foot
up his fucking ass too.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.869
Okay.
All right. All right.

12:24.870 --> 12:27.247
No, um,
Tom says he's quite happy

12:27.248 --> 12:28.873
with the voice he's got
at the moment,

12:28.874 --> 12:30.750
and he's happy to go
with that.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.752
What are you doing?

12:32.753 --> 12:34.337
I'm on a set filming a scene.

12:34.338 --> 12:36.256
Is something wrong with you?

12:36.257 --> 12:38.091
No, I'm just relaying what
the director said, Christian.

12:38.092 --> 12:39.634
Well, if he got something
to relay,

12:39.635 --> 12:42.053
the fucking guy comes
and fucking tells me!

12:42.054 --> 12:43.930
Yes, no, I understand.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.598
Don't you worry about it, Tom.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.225
It's fine.

12:47.226 --> 12:49.394
Yeah.
They're both upset now.

12:49.395 --> 12:51.020
Okay.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.773
He can just say it
in front of me...

12:54.608 --> 12:56.693
Is this not something
we could fix in post?

12:56.694 --> 12:58.334
Because I think you opened
a can of worms.

12:59.697 --> 13:01.197
I know. I know.
I'm on your side.

13:01.198 --> 13:03.074
I know.
I understand perfectly, Tom.

13:03.075 --> 13:04.492
And, Christian-no, you too.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.077
Yes.
No, I understand.

13:06.078 --> 13:08.079
We're all in the same scene.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.123
'That's what I told him.
I think he's-l think he.

13:10.124 --> 13:12.292
Yeah. Shall I?
He says it's fine.

13:12.293 --> 13:13.835
Just-just go with the voices.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.921
Fucking halle-fucking-lujah.
Yeah, okay.

13:24.013 --> 13:25.847
I like Tom Hardy.
I couldn't do what he does.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.765
I couldn't do it.
Neither could you.

13:27.766 --> 13:30.143
But then he couldn't do
he couldn't do what I do.

13:30.144 --> 13:31.185
When you're saying
something like,

13:31.186 --> 13:32.603
See in store for details...

13:32.604 --> 13:34.189
No way he could do that.
No, no, no.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.276
Sorry?
Where do I look for details?

13:38.277 --> 13:39.902
And what's the thing where
you have to talk really quickly,

13:39.903 --> 13:41.195
with the disclaimer at the end?

13:41.196 --> 13:42.613
Your home may be at risk
if you don't keep up

13:42.614 --> 13:43.740
repayments
on your loan taken out.

13:43.741 --> 13:44.991
Terms and conditions may apply.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.076
No projection.
If you project, you add time.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.119
Yeah.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.788
Now, Hardy.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.335
You got through it.
Well, yeah.

13:55.336 --> 13:56.377
Look, I'm a pro.
I'm a pro.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.378
I can't be any other way.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.796
But your average family,

13:58.797 --> 14:00.423
in the middle
of Coronation Street.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.175
'What the hell is that?

14:02.176 --> 14:03.259
They're throwing things.

14:03.260 --> 14:04.677
They're throwing the remote
at the screen.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.262
Mm, yeah.
No, no, I'm with you.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.806
I can Hardy understand
what he's saying.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.808
Mm, I wouldn't say that
to his face, though.

14:10.809 --> 14:12.560
No, never.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:12.561 --> 14:13.811
Never.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.938
If I see him
Loved Batman.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.940
Some people said
they couldn't understand you.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.693
They're just wrong.
Yeah.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.744
Oh, wow, look at that.
Yeah.

14:33.374 --> 14:35.041
Grazie.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.834
Grazie.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.252
Ah. Grazie.
Grazie.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.962
Look at that.
Do you know what?

14:39.963 --> 14:41.215
That's just...

14:43.217 --> 14:44.884
There's a lovely
Mmm!

14:44.885 --> 14:46.010
Lovely...

14:46.011 --> 14:47.595
Mmm...
Game.

14:47.596 --> 14:49.514
Mmm.
We're both eating game.

14:49.515 --> 14:51.099
Mmm.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.642
Game's very good for you.

14:52.643 --> 14:53.684
Mmm.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.853
Because living in the wild,

14:55.854 --> 14:56.896
it's had lots of nutrition.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.439
It's been eating wild.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.149
It's been-this is
Been exercising.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.485
On the run, very fit,
exercise.

15:02.486 --> 15:04.320
So if you were to eat
Mo Farah...

15:04.321 --> 15:05.363
Yeah.

15:05.364 --> 15:06.864
It'd be fantastically
beneficial.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.491
It's the equivalent
of eating Mo Farah

15:08.492 --> 15:09.951
if you were in a plane crash
with him.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.619
Yeah. Yeah.

15:11.620 --> 15:12.995
If you were in a crash
with him...

15:12.996 --> 15:14.997
In the Andes.
In the Andes...

15:14.998 --> 15:17.376
I'd eat him first
if he was dead.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.045
What if
he was mortally wounded,

15:21.046 --> 15:23.214
you know there was no chance
of him surviving,

15:23.215 --> 15:25.633
and he'd lost all feeling
in his lower body?

15:25.634 --> 15:27.593
Would you start to eat
those fantastic legs?

15:27.594 --> 15:28.886
No,
'cause that would be rude.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.054
Keep in the freshness.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.848
No, no, there's no rudeness.
He's gonna die.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.975
He's already paralyzed
from the waist down.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.935
Mo, Mo, you know you're not
gonna get up again.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.478
If you put a tent up
halfway along

15:37.479 --> 15:39.230
and you distracted him
by chatting to him...

15:39.231 --> 15:40.314
Yeah.
Possibly.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.899
About his glories
at the Olympics,

15:41.900 --> 15:44.360
reliving those moments
You united the nation, Mo.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.112
You were wonderful.
Well, you know what?

15:46.113 --> 15:47.572
It's a bit
of a silly conversation,

15:47.573 --> 15:51.784
but if you
but given a choice,

15:51.785 --> 15:54.203
I'd rather eat Mo Farah's legs
than yours, and that's not.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.955
Well, there's gonna be
a lot more benefit in them.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.540
I'd be the first to admit.

15:57.541 --> 15:58.958
Only a fool would eat

15:58.959 --> 16:00.126
my legs
over Mo Farah's legs.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.127
Yeah.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.336
I'm trying to think

16:02.337 --> 16:04.297
who I'd eat your legs over.

16:04.298 --> 16:06.090
Um...

16:06.091 --> 16:07.675
Stephen Hawking.

16:07.676 --> 16:09.093
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah?

16:09.094 --> 16:11.095
Although I'd definitely
eat his brains first...

16:11.096 --> 16:12.723
Yeah.
Before yours.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.684
Well, that was just right.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.186
Shall I drive?

16:18.187 --> 16:20.271
You've had three glasses
of Barolo.

16:20.272 --> 16:21.814
I haven't had any.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.065
All right,
but I am gonna drive

16:23.066 --> 16:24.442
at some point on this trip.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.903
Perhaps.
To be discussed.

16:26.904 --> 16:28.529
I can drive in the mornings,

16:28.530 --> 16:30.491
have a bottle at lunchtime,
and then...

16:32.075 --> 16:34.577
Slump in the passenger seat
in the afternoon.

16:34.578 --> 16:35.870
What are you doing
in the boot?

16:35.871 --> 16:37.498
Just getting some music.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.124
One CD.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.292
Sounds ominous.

16:41.293 --> 16:42.710
Not Tom Jones, is it?

16:42.711 --> 16:45.129
Alanis Morissette.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.255
You're kidding me.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.133
It's, uh, Sally's.

16:50.719 --> 16:51.802
My wife.

16:51.803 --> 16:52.930
Ah, yeah.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.018
Shall, uh-shall we?

16:59.019 --> 17:00.938
Uh...
Nah.

17:10.781 --> 17:12.114
Hello?

17:12.115 --> 17:13.699
Uh, hey, Dad.
It's Joe.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.117
Oh, hello.
How are you?

17:15.117 --> 17:17.744
Uh, I'm okay.
Where are you?

17:17.746 --> 17:20.455
I'm in Italy with Rob
Rob Brydon.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.083
Buongiorno!
Yeah.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.042
That's him talking Italian,
like a native.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.086
No. Yeah.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.378
So maybe it's better
you and I

17:26.380 --> 17:29.048
talk later on Skype
at the hotel.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.258
Yeah, all right.
Okay.

17:30.259 --> 17:31.384
Good.
All right.

17:31.385 --> 17:32.970
Speak to you later.
Bye.

17:35.806 --> 17:38.182
Yeah.
Ah, well. Teenagers.

17:38.183 --> 17:41.310
He's, uh-he's in Ibiza
with his mum and Mamie.

17:41.311 --> 17:42.895
Ah.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.772
Wondered why
you were so willing to come away

17:44.773 --> 17:46.774
when you could have
been with your kids.

17:46.775 --> 17:49.193
You don't get to see them
very much, do you?

17:49.194 --> 17:52.238
Well, that's-that's why
I'm quite glad that, uh,

17:52.239 --> 17:57.535
Pathology hasn't been
picked up for a third series.

17:57.536 --> 18:01.206
Yeah, so-plus, I'm
I'm just tired of L.A., really.

18:03.250 --> 18:07.879
So your hiatus has been
indefinitely extended.

18:09.298 --> 18:11.132
Yes, through the summer
to the autumn

18:11.133 --> 18:13.217
but hopefully not as far
as the winter.

18:13.218 --> 18:15.011
It's a midlife hiatus.

18:15.012 --> 18:19.724
Your mini hiatus
is a midlife hiatus.

18:19.725 --> 18:22.018
You still want to get
your photograph taken

18:22.019 --> 18:23.519
outside Byron's house?

18:23.520 --> 18:25.688
Yes.

18:25.689 --> 18:28.442
The publishers want photos
for the book.

18:30.027 --> 18:32.111
1822 t01823.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.113
It's only one year
he lived here?

18:34.114 --> 18:35.406
That's just a holiday, that.

18:35.407 --> 18:38.117
This was
just before he died.

18:38.118 --> 18:41.454
He was essentially on the run
from England

18:41.455 --> 18:44.832
'cause he'd, you know,
slept with his sister,

18:44.833 --> 18:48.252
sodomized his wife
and some young boys.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.631
Yes, some of that
is out of order.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.636
Is it Alahnis or Alannis?

18:56.637 --> 18:57.637
It's Alahnis.

18:57.638 --> 18:58.638
How do you know that?

18:58.639 --> 19:00.264
Because I just decided.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.266
And that's-that's good enough.
Right.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.351
Because in America,

19:03.352 --> 19:04.769
people just call themselves
what they want.

19:04.770 --> 19:06.604
I'm sure her dad's probably
called Alan.

19:06.605 --> 19:08.856
In which case
it would be Alan-is.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.650
Uh, not necessarily.

19:10.651 --> 19:13.069
I wouldn't be surprised
if a lot of blokes in America

19:13.070 --> 19:15.697
called Alan
say it's Alahn.

19:16.907 --> 19:18.282
Hi, I'm Alahn.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.909
I got some properties
down at Boca Vista.

19:19.910 --> 19:21.202
I'd love you to take a look.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.745
And Morissette

19:22.746 --> 19:24.580
it's probably
that she was a Morrissey fan

19:24.581 --> 19:26.182
and decided to call herself
a Morissette.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.459
She's not American, though.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.669
I will pick you up on that.

19:29.670 --> 19:31.587
Alanis is Canadian.

19:31.588 --> 19:34.924
Avril Lavigne, in many ways,

19:34.925 --> 19:37.677
is the young person's
Alanis Morissette.

19:37.678 --> 19:38.886
You know,
I don't want to be

19:38.887 --> 19:40.846
I don't want to do down
a young performer,

19:40.847 --> 19:42.431
but she's no Alanis Morissette.

19:42.432 --> 19:44.975
Alanis Morissette is authentic,
an authentic voice.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.103
So you do like
Alanis Morissette.

19:47.104 --> 19:48.145
Yes!

19:48.146 --> 19:49.480
Relative to Avril Lavigne.

19:49.481 --> 19:50.690
Come on, then.

19:50.691 --> 19:54.318
All right, let's have
a nostalgia trip back to 1995,

19:54.319 --> 19:57.363
when we were both
but 30 years old.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.533
That's why Sally loves it.
She was only 2O then.

20:01.493 --> 20:03.786
â™ª Do I stress you out? â™ª

20:03.787 --> 20:04.912
Yes, you do.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.914
â™ª My sweater is on backwards
and inside out â™ª

20:06.915 --> 20:08.666
â™ª And you say, how... â™ª

20:08.667 --> 20:10.334
How appropriate.
â™ª Appropriate â™ª

20:10.335 --> 20:12.378
You know, I can see the appeal
in a woman like this.

20:12.379 --> 20:15.256
Volatile women are always sexy
when you first meet them,

20:15.257 --> 20:17.675
but two years down the line,
you're sort of saying things

20:17.676 --> 20:21.262
like, Can you just put the lids
back on these jars, please?

20:21.263 --> 20:24.932
I admire you taking a stand
against society's mores

20:24.933 --> 20:27.351
by wearing your jumper
inside out.

20:27.352 --> 20:29.228
Yeah?
But enough is enough.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.564
Exactly.

20:32.941 --> 20:35.025
And I am frightened by

20:35.026 --> 20:37.236
the corrupted ways
of this land.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.155
If only I could meet my maker.

20:39.156 --> 20:42.491
And I am fascinated
by the spiritual man.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.910
I am humbled
by his humble nature.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.287
Do you know what?

20:46.288 --> 20:48.831
It is music that appeals
to neurotic teenage girls,

20:48.832 --> 20:50.583
but it's actually rather good.

20:50.584 --> 20:52.585
Byron appealed
to teenage girls.

20:52.586 --> 20:53.836
Very true, very true.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.129
â™ª And all I really want â™ª

20:55.130 --> 20:58.591
â™ª Is deliverance â™ª

20:58.592 --> 21:03.889
â™ª But how â™ª

21:12.105 --> 21:13.731
Look at that.

21:13.732 --> 21:15.399
Doesn't get
much better than that, Rob.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.027
Absolutely stunning.
Gorgeous.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.987
La Dolce Vita.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.614
We're living the dream.

21:21.615 --> 21:23.324
It's funny, isn't it?

21:23.325 --> 21:25.326
Women that age just look
straight through us, don't they?

21:25.327 --> 21:26.535
Nonthreatening.

21:26.536 --> 21:27.953
Yeah, they don't even
find us threatening.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.413
They don't even
find me lascivious,

21:29.414 --> 21:30.831
because they think
I couldn't possibly

21:30.832 --> 21:32.583
be thinking like that.

21:32.584 --> 21:35.920
The one in the blue top
looks like a younger me,

21:35.921 --> 21:37.630
a younger, idealized version
of me,

21:37.631 --> 21:39.507
a lovely hybrid of Springsteen
and Pacino.

21:39.508 --> 21:42.301
He's like you,
uh, after a computer has

21:42.302 --> 21:44.011
has corrected
all your deficiencies.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.721
He's an airbrushed me.
Isn't he?

21:45.722 --> 21:47.556
He's like the best surgeon
in the world

21:47.557 --> 21:48.974
has been given a year
with you.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.643
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you.

21:50.644 --> 21:52.228
There was a
there was a time

21:52.229 --> 21:54.021
when I used to make eye contact
with a woman,

21:54.022 --> 21:55.815
and she'd flash a smile back,

21:55.816 --> 21:59.026
and that's all it would be,
just a little moment.

21:59.027 --> 22:01.028
Those-those women just, uh

22:01.029 --> 22:02.696
they just
the smile you get from them

22:02.697 --> 22:06.742
is the smile they give
to a benevolent uncle.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.202
Or a pest.

22:08.203 --> 22:10.788
Well, let's just look
this way.

22:10.789 --> 22:13.374
Nature never disappoints you.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.209
No rejection.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.836
Quite rough, though.
Yeah.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.295
Supposed to be
getting a boat tomorrow,

22:18.296 --> 22:19.797
going to the Bay of Poets.

22:19.798 --> 22:21.048
Are we?

22:21.049 --> 22:23.468
Yeah.
Where Byron swam.

22:25.887 --> 22:27.012
Hello?

22:27.013 --> 22:28.264
Hey, Dad.
Hey.

22:28.265 --> 22:31.976
So...
Ibiza, party central.

22:31.977 --> 22:34.061
Ciao, bellissima.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.688
Hi.

22:35.689 --> 22:37.106
Hey.
How are you?

22:37.107 --> 22:38.315
I'm okay, sort of.

22:38.316 --> 22:39.400
Chloe's still awake.

22:39.401 --> 22:40.860
What?

22:40.861 --> 22:43.487
I can't get her
to go to sleep.

22:43.488 --> 22:45.072
She miss her papa?

22:45.073 --> 22:46.866
Stick her on,
and I'll say good night to her.

22:46.867 --> 22:48.576
No, I don't think
that will help.

22:48.577 --> 22:50.202
I think it'll only
make it worse, Rob.

22:50.203 --> 22:51.829
All right, well
She's crying again.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.831
I'm sorry.
I've got to go, darling.

22:53.832 --> 22:55.332
You know, it'd probably
be more fun if there

22:55.333 --> 22:56.750
you know,
if my friends were here.

22:56.751 --> 22:59.003
But, you know, they're all off
in London having fun,

22:59.004 --> 23:01.088
and I'm stuck here by myself.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.756
I'm 16.

23:02.757 --> 23:04.717
Mum keeps treating me
like I'm a child.

23:04.718 --> 23:07.303
I mean, I'm old enough
to join the army,

23:07.304 --> 23:09.179
and according to her,

23:09.180 --> 23:11.849
I'm not old enough
to just be at home by myself.

23:11.850 --> 23:14.143
Yeah, well, I think
they should raise the age level

23:14.144 --> 23:16.145
for entry to the army,
actually.

23:16.146 --> 23:17.605
All right, then.
So long, love. Bye-bye.

23:17.606 --> 23:19.149
Bye.
' BYE-bye.

23:22.861 --> 23:27.865
Ciao, bellissima.

23:27.866 --> 23:33.203
Que belle mgazza.

23:33.204 --> 23:34.205
Oh!

23:35.206 --> 23:37.041
Ciao, bellissimo.

23:37.042 --> 23:39.043
Que bella
Yeah!

23:39.044 --> 23:41.170
Ragazza!

23:41.171 --> 23:43.088
â™ª Think I better dance now â™ª

23:43.089 --> 23:46.550
Que bella
what a beautiful.

23:46.551 --> 23:48.218
Ragazza.

23:48.219 --> 23:50.012
Girl.

23:50.013 --> 23:53.766
I think you got a wonderful tone
to your voice,

23:53.767 --> 23:56.560
and I want you on my team.

23:56.561 --> 23:58.104
Oh!

24:04.569 --> 24:05.778
Okay
okay.

24:05.779 --> 24:07.363
Right.

24:07.364 --> 24:09.365
Permission to come aboard?

24:09.366 --> 24:12.785
Sorry. I don't need help.
No. I'm fine.

24:12.786 --> 24:14.370
. Okay?

24:14.371 --> 24:15.789
That's fine.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.375
All right.
Okay?

24:19.376 --> 24:20.542
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thank you.

24:20.543 --> 24:22.629
If you just step-yeah?

24:24.422 --> 24:26.215
Is this the, um...

24:26.216 --> 24:27.591
Is it the actual boat?

24:27.592 --> 24:29.093
'Cause I thought

24:29.094 --> 24:31.011
I was expecting
something a bit bigger.

24:31.012 --> 24:32.638
A little smaller
than I was expecting as well.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.431
I'll be very honest with you.

24:34.432 --> 24:36.308
Look at that!

24:36.309 --> 24:37.685
Wow!

24:37.686 --> 24:39.395
This is our boat, Patience.

24:39.396 --> 24:40.938
Patience is a virtue.

24:40.939 --> 24:42.565
That is beautiful.

25:01.793 --> 25:02.835
Hi.

25:02.836 --> 25:04.003
Oh, hello.
Thank you.

25:04.004 --> 25:06.213
Lovely boat,
lovely way to travel.

25:06.214 --> 25:09.675
Yeah, so the first stop
is San Fruttuoso,

25:09.676 --> 25:11.760
where you'll have lunch.

25:11.761 --> 25:13.846
My soul is an enchanted boat,

25:13.847 --> 25:15.556
which, like a sleeping swan,

25:15.557 --> 25:18.642
doth float upon the silver waves
of thy sweet singing.

25:18.643 --> 25:21.311
That's Shelley,
read by Burton.

25:21.312 --> 25:23.397
Rob can't do poems
in his own voice

25:23.398 --> 25:25.399
because he lacks conviction.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.943
My soul is an enchanted boat,

25:27.944 --> 25:29.862
which, like a sleeping swan,

25:29.863 --> 25:32.781
doth float
upon the silver waves of

25:32.782 --> 25:34.868
thy sweet singing.

25:57.098 --> 25:58.599
Prego.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.641
Grazie mille.

25:59.642 --> 26:01.268
Ooh.
Ooh.

26:01.269 --> 26:02.686
Look at this.
Lovely.

26:02.687 --> 26:04.396
50,000 Leagues
Under the Sea.

26:04.397 --> 26:06.065
It is a bit
it's very Jules Verne,

26:06.066 --> 26:08.108
this starter,
I have to say, yeah.

26:08.109 --> 26:09.318
We're squids in.

26:09.319 --> 26:11.028
Squids in.
6 quid.

26:11.029 --> 26:13.031
Ohh, I've got the squids.

26:15.492 --> 26:17.576
Very nice, isn't she-Lucy?

26:17.577 --> 26:19.078
' Mmm!

26:19.079 --> 26:21.080
Not the squid. Lucy.
Mmm.

26:21.081 --> 26:23.290
It's not very Italian, though,
is it, you know,

26:23.291 --> 26:25.793
hanging out with
some British Sloane woman?

26:25.794 --> 26:27.211
If you look at
Shelley and Byron,

26:27.212 --> 26:28.921
they were always
staying with English people,

26:28.922 --> 26:30.422
all the expats.

26:30.423 --> 26:31.799
That's how it was, you see?

26:31.800 --> 26:33.926
You know,
when you're in L.A.,

26:33.927 --> 26:37.221
I bet you are at Soho House
on a Saturday afternoon,

26:37.222 --> 26:39.765
watching football on the TV
with Robbie Williams.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.517
No, I don't hang out
with Robbie Williams.

26:41.518 --> 26:43.143
When I am in L.A.,

26:43.144 --> 26:45.479
I do what Byron actually did
when he was traveling,

26:45.480 --> 26:47.064
which is hang out
with local people.

26:47.065 --> 26:49.316
Matt Stone, Trey Parker,

26:49.317 --> 26:51.693
Matthew Perry, Owen Wilson.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.237
You hang out with Owen Wilson

26:53.238 --> 26:55.114
or you occasionally
work with Owen Wilson?

26:55.115 --> 26:57.324
I know you've been
a miniature soldier with him,

26:57.325 --> 26:59.785
but do you actually
hang out with him?

26:59.786 --> 27:01.745
We run together on the beach.

27:01.746 --> 27:03.747
Is he aware
that you're running?

27:03.748 --> 27:05.082
Is he running away from you?

27:05.083 --> 27:06.708
I mean,
there's a distinction here.

27:06.709 --> 27:09.128
I could say I've been running on
the beach with Robert De Niro,

27:09.129 --> 27:11.255
when, in fact,
I'm furiously chasing after him,

27:11.256 --> 27:12.464
and he's running for his life.

27:12.465 --> 27:13.632
What are you doing there?

27:13.633 --> 27:16.385
Just having a bit of wine.

27:16.386 --> 27:18.011
You know, when in Rome.
Wow.

27:18.012 --> 27:19.054
When in Italy.

27:19.055 --> 27:20.931
I'm your enabler.

27:20.932 --> 27:21.975
Yeah.

27:23.351 --> 27:25.769
I'd love to talk
to some of these locals.

27:25.770 --> 27:27.521
Byron said.

27:27.522 --> 27:29.815
I love the language,
that bastard Latin,

27:29.816 --> 27:32.734
that melts like kisses
from a female mouth.

27:32.735 --> 27:35.821
It sounds
as if it should be writ on satin

27:35.822 --> 27:38.199
with syllables that breathe
of the sweet south.

27:51.004 --> 27:53.255
Watch your heads.

27:53.256 --> 27:54.756
William,
the men are not happy.

27:54.757 --> 27:55.883
Oh, 'William, is it?

27:55.884 --> 27:57.009
Not captain or sir?

27:57.010 --> 27:58.343
Well, you can tell the men

27:58.344 --> 28:00.220
that we will sail
around the Cape of Good Hope,

28:00.221 --> 28:01.471
and we'll sail around
the Horn.

28:01.472 --> 28:02.890
You turned your back on me,
man.

28:02.891 --> 28:04.766
God damn your eyes!
God damn your eyes, man!

28:04.767 --> 28:06.602
You turned your back on me!

28:06.603 --> 28:07.936
He's doing Anthony Hopkins.

28:07.937 --> 28:09.563
Don't worry.
It'll pass.

28:09.564 --> 28:11.148
Well, you tell the men

28:11.149 --> 28:12.524
that we will sail
around the Cape of Good Hope

28:12.525 --> 28:13.901
and sail around the Horn.

28:13.902 --> 28:14.985
Around the Horn,
the quick way

28:14.986 --> 28:16.111
round the Horn
we shall go, sir!

28:16.112 --> 28:17.362
Around the Horn we shall go,
sir!

28:17.363 --> 28:18.989
Damn your eyes!
Cover him.

28:18.990 --> 28:20.073
Damn your eyes!

28:20.074 --> 28:21.366
Damn you, Mad Max!

28:21.367 --> 28:22.743
You turned your back on me,
man!

28:22.744 --> 28:24.119
Don't turn your back on me!

28:24.120 --> 28:25.954
Round the Horn we're going!

28:25.955 --> 28:27.832
The quicker way round the Horn
we shall go.

28:45.642 --> 28:47.643
Hey.
Hi.

28:47.644 --> 28:48.894
Ooh, careful.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.270
Oh, yeah.

28:50.271 --> 28:51.563
Not too rough for you?

28:51.564 --> 28:52.898
No, no, it's fine.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.107
You enjoying it?

28:54.108 --> 28:55.692
Yeah, this is fantastic,

28:55.693 --> 28:57.736
wonderful.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.488
Steve's having a little sleep.

28:59.489 --> 29:02.074
Had a drink,
so, uh, at his age,

29:02.075 --> 29:03.617
he needs a nap after lunch,

29:03.618 --> 29:04.743
or he gets confused.

29:04.744 --> 29:06.161
How old is he?

29:06.162 --> 29:07.454
He doesn't like me to say.
Oh.

29:07.455 --> 29:09.456
Doesn't like me to share that.

29:09.457 --> 29:10.874
Does he drink a lot?

29:10.875 --> 29:13.252
Well...

29:13.253 --> 29:14.878
So this is the anchor.

29:14.879 --> 29:16.505
And then
if you want to stop somewhere,

29:16.506 --> 29:18.590
you drop the sail;
Is that right'?

29:18.591 --> 29:20.676
Where are you from, then?
Wales, right'?

29:20.677 --> 29:22.928
Wales, South Wales,
Port Talbot.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.554
Oh, I love the accent.

29:24.555 --> 29:26.098
Do you?
Yeah, it's beautiful.

29:26.099 --> 29:28.350
Seriously?
Yeah, it's really lyrical.

29:28.351 --> 29:31.186
To begin at the beginning.

29:31.187 --> 29:32.688
Just got to
make your mouth very.

29:32.689 --> 29:34.356
To begin...
To begin.

29:34.357 --> 29:36.692
Yes, you have to
to push your lips out.

29:36.693 --> 29:38.111
To begin...

29:39.904 --> 29:42.114
To begin at the beginning.

29:42.115 --> 29:43.533
To begin...

29:46.536 --> 29:54.536
â™ª â™ª

29:58.798 --> 30:00.924
It's a lovely house.

30:00.925 --> 30:02.509
I mean, it's better than
Byron's, isn't it?

30:02.510 --> 30:04.136
You got a lovely balcony
there.

30:04.137 --> 30:06.596
Look out over the bay.

30:06.597 --> 30:08.140
See if you can get my face

30:08.141 --> 30:09.975
and it in
so it's legible.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.977
Don't look ironic.
I'm not.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.478
It's not
the most flattering angle,

30:13.479 --> 30:14.999
but it's got
all the information, so...

30:21.195 --> 30:22.863
Did you like it?
Was it nice?

30:22.864 --> 30:25.032
It was-it was a bit busier
than I was expecting.

30:25.033 --> 30:26.658
Spoiled by tourism.
Yeah.

30:26.659 --> 30:27.993
Yeah,
when Shelley lived there,

30:27.994 --> 30:29.077
it would have been deserted.

30:29.078 --> 30:30.162
Yeah?

30:30.163 --> 30:31.788
Do you want to go back
to San Fruttuoso?

30:31.789 --> 30:33.374
Yes.
It was lovely there.

30:55.271 --> 30:58.815
Come and have a drink!

30:58.816 --> 31:01.027
. Okay!

31:04.447 --> 31:07.032
Mm.

31:07.033 --> 31:09.451
Yep.
I've still got it.

31:09.452 --> 31:11.161
A bit shocked, aren't you?
Not really.

31:11.162 --> 31:13.373
I've always told you
that it was a possibility.

31:14.999 --> 31:17.752
You know, you're an acquired
taste, but, you know...

31:21.381 --> 31:24.341
Something quite about melancholy
about this place, isn't there?

31:24.342 --> 31:28.053
It's like getting stranded
on a desert island.

31:28.054 --> 31:30.180
Yeah, only not as hot.

31:30.181 --> 31:32.015
Desert doesn't mean hot.

31:32.016 --> 31:34.017
Desert just means
there's no people there.

31:34.018 --> 31:36.061
There still can be water.
It just means deserted.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.437
Yes, I know that.
I know that.

31:37.438 --> 31:39.189
Don't you think
everything's melancholic

31:39.190 --> 31:40.732
once you get to a certain age?

31:40.733 --> 31:41.775
I do.

31:41.776 --> 31:44.945
Garrison Keillor said,
'When you're under 40,

31:44.946 --> 31:48.281
seeming unhappy
makes you look interesting,

31:48.282 --> 31:50.450
but once you're 40 and beyond,

31:50.451 --> 31:52.994
you got to do
everything you can to smile.

31:52.995 --> 31:54.746
Otherwise, you just look like
a grumpy old man.

31:54.747 --> 31:57.457
Morrissey.

31:57.458 --> 31:59.836
Byron was famously gloomy.

32:01.129 --> 32:03.046
What will
people remember of us

32:03.047 --> 32:05.173
in 200 years' time?

32:05.174 --> 32:06.299
Ir.

32:06.300 --> 32:07.300
That's a big if.

32:07.301 --> 32:08.385
If we are.

32:08.386 --> 32:10.470
Either of us are remembered.

32:10.471 --> 32:11.847
I would say that it's

32:11.848 --> 32:13.765
it would probably be me.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.934
What would they
what would they most remember?

32:15.935 --> 32:18.354
What would be celebrated
about you, do you think?

32:19.981 --> 32:21.107
Six BAFTAs.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.818
You've got five BAFTAs.

32:24.819 --> 32:27.988
Yeah, but I'll probably
get a lifetime achievement.

32:27.989 --> 32:30.282
True. Yeah, you will.
More if I survive.

32:30.283 --> 32:31.741
You could have it
posthumously.

32:31.742 --> 32:34.661
I like to think
if you did win it posthumously,

32:34.662 --> 32:36.455
I'd be the one to accept it
on your behalf.

32:36.456 --> 32:39.332
Unless, of course, if I was
the architect of your death,

32:39.333 --> 32:42.210
in which case I'd still
like to receive it from my cell

32:42.211 --> 32:43.670
via satellite link.

32:43.671 --> 32:45.089
Yeah.

32:46.048 --> 32:48.467
Thrilled to have this.

32:48.468 --> 32:52.345
You know, I killed Steve
for the good of mankind.

32:52.346 --> 32:54.264
Do I regret what I've done?

32:54.265 --> 32:55.682
Not really,
because I think the world's.

32:55.683 --> 32:57.434
Lights out!
Got to go. Good.

32:57.435 --> 32:58.602
' BrYdOn!

32:58.603 --> 33:00.228
Lights out, you nonce!

33:00.229 --> 33:02.981
Uh, yeah,
that's not what I'm in for,

33:02.982 --> 33:05.567
but I accept it
as a general derogatory term.

33:05.568 --> 33:07.569
Come on, Rob. Come to bed.

33:07.570 --> 33:09.529
All right, Melvin.

33:09.530 --> 33:10.655
I'll be a minute.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.407
Anyway, that's all from me.
I want a cuddle.

33:12.408 --> 33:13.742
Yeah, it's all right.

33:13.743 --> 33:15.410
I'll give you a cuddle.
Please just wait.

33:15.411 --> 33:17.829
Um, so anyway, on Steve's
behalf, thanks for this.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.789
He would have loved it,
but, you know, he's gone.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.333
Come on.
Yeah, all right.

33:21.334 --> 33:22.877
I'm horny!
I want to go on the inside.

33:24.295 --> 33:26.129
Of the bed, of the bed,
of the bed,

33:26.130 --> 33:30.176
not the inside of the inmate
the inside of the bed.

33:32.845 --> 33:35.097
I better go and call Joe.

33:37.266 --> 33:38.351
See you in a bit.

33:42.522 --> 33:44.981
So how did you end up here?

33:44.982 --> 33:46.608
Hmm.

33:46.609 --> 33:48.527
My boyfriend had a boat.

33:48.528 --> 33:50.445
We sailed together.

33:50.446 --> 33:54.074
Then when we broke up,
I had to find work,

33:54.075 --> 33:57.160
so I got a job on the crew.

33:57.161 --> 33:58.371
Must be fun.

33:59.830 --> 34:01.831
Sometimes.

34:01.832 --> 34:04.584
Do you have children?

34:04.585 --> 34:05.919
No.

34:05.920 --> 34:08.380
I wish I did.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.672
DO you?

34:09.674 --> 34:11.174
Yeah.

34:11.175 --> 34:14.386
I've got a daughter, Chloe.

34:14.387 --> 34:15.637
She's three.

34:15.638 --> 34:17.514
Aww.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.768
She's gorgeous.

34:21.768 --> 34:22.978
Do you miss her?

34:22.978 --> 34:24.187
Yeah.

34:24.188 --> 34:26.190
It's been two days, so I'm...

34:27.567 --> 34:29.777
I'm not pining, but...

34:31.737 --> 34:33.154
ls thy face

34:33.155 --> 34:37.117
like thy mother's,
fair, my child?

34:37.118 --> 34:38.534
Chloe:

34:38.536 --> 34:43.415
Sole daughter
of my house and heart.

34:43.416 --> 34:45.250
When last I saw
thy young blue eyes,

34:45.251 --> 34:48.043
they smiled,
and then we parted.

34:48.045 --> 34:49.795
Is that your Hugh Grant
impression?

34:49.797 --> 34:51.215
Yes, I'm afraid it is.
Yes, yes.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.426
I think that Steve's
absolutely right.

34:54.427 --> 34:55.844
I do find it very difficult to

34:55.844 --> 34:57.804
uh, gosh, crikey
say a poem, uh,

34:57.805 --> 34:59.431
unless
it's somebody else's voice.

34:59.432 --> 35:01.433
And Hugh
just happened to be passing,

35:01.434 --> 35:03.643
you know, on-on the beach.

35:03.644 --> 35:05.353
And he popped over for a blow...

35:05.354 --> 35:09.025
By-blow account
of what was going on.

35:10.401 --> 35:12.611
Sorrow is knowledge.

35:12.612 --> 35:14.446
They who know the most

35:14.447 --> 35:18.241
must mourn the deepest
o'er the fatal truth.

35:18.242 --> 35:22.496
The tree of knowledge
is not that of life.

35:48.898 --> 35:50.066
Fuck.

35:51.150 --> 35:52.860
Fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck.

35:57.740 --> 35:58.948
You Okay?

35:58.949 --> 36:00.284
Yes.
Fine.

36:01.452 --> 36:03.370
How was last night?

36:03.371 --> 36:05.121
Fine.

36:05.122 --> 36:06.665
You want to elaborate?

36:06.666 --> 36:08.792
I don't want to talk about it,

36:08.793 --> 36:11.002
and that's not the cue
for an ABBA song.

36:11.003 --> 36:12.545
Well, I think
when most people say

36:12.546 --> 36:14.172
they don't want to talk
about it,

36:14.173 --> 36:16.758
it means it didn't go very well,
but with you,

36:16.759 --> 36:21.221
I'd infer that, uh, it
it went pretty well.

36:21.222 --> 36:22.932
Yeah.
Too well.

36:32.525 --> 36:34.526
It's not how I imagined
it would be.

36:34.527 --> 36:38.196
I've never seen
so many deck chairs.

36:38.197 --> 36:40.907
See, you got Shelley
upon his funeral pyre,

36:40.908 --> 36:42.701
Byron staring wistfully
into space.

36:42.702 --> 36:43.910
That's Trelawney.

36:43.911 --> 36:45.787
He's the guy that
commissioned the boat, so...

36:45.788 --> 36:47.205
Oh, that's a bit awkward.

36:47.206 --> 36:49.040
Hence he's staring
at his feet.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.375
They wouldn't sue
in those days,

36:50.376 --> 36:52.293
not like they do now.

36:52.294 --> 36:53.670
Have you been injured at work

36:53.671 --> 36:55.380
while composing romantic poetry
on a boat?

36:55.381 --> 36:56.798
Call now!
Yeah.

36:56.799 --> 36:58.800
0800-471-471.

36:58.801 --> 37:02.345
You could win up to Â£5,000.

37:02.346 --> 37:03.346
Like Mr. Shelley.

37:03.347 --> 37:04.723
Guineas. Guineas.

37:04.724 --> 37:07.726
You could win
up to 5,000 guineas,

37:07.727 --> 37:09.728
like Mr. Shelley
from the U.K.!

37:09.729 --> 37:11.771
They wouldn't have called it
the U.K.

37:11.772 --> 37:13.941
Like Mr. Shelley
from Great Britain!

37:15.568 --> 37:17.736
But this is a very idealized
version of everything.

37:17.737 --> 37:19.404
I mean, he wouldn't have
looked like that.

37:19.405 --> 37:21.614
He'd been bobbing around
for two weeks,

37:21.615 --> 37:24.951
so he'd have been bloated
beyond belief.

37:24.952 --> 37:27.746
Everything looks better
in a painting, doesn't it?

37:27.747 --> 37:30.582
I sometimes think
that one day, I will be

37:30.583 --> 37:32.834
and so will you
on a slab.

37:32.835 --> 37:33.877
. YeP.

37:33.878 --> 37:36.087
You'll have a little tag
round your toe,

37:36.088 --> 37:38.757
and somebody will be there
embalming you.

37:38.758 --> 37:40.216
Yep.
Ever think that?

37:40.217 --> 37:42.051
'Cause it is gonna happen.

37:42.052 --> 37:44.012
Unless you're lost at sea,
and we cannot find you,

37:44.013 --> 37:45.054
which is unlikely...

37:45.055 --> 37:46.097
Oh, God.

37:46.098 --> 37:48.641
You will one day
lie on a slab.

37:48.642 --> 37:49.726
Ah!

37:49.727 --> 37:51.186
You will. You will.

37:51.187 --> 37:52.771
It's better to accept it.

37:52.772 --> 37:54.397
You're gonna be on a slab.
Yeah.

37:54.398 --> 37:56.065
And then
and you'll be naked.

37:56.066 --> 37:58.485
Then somebody else
will dress you.

37:58.486 --> 37:59.903
Yeah, but I'd do

37:59.904 --> 38:01.654
I would imagine, with you,
that will happen

38:01.655 --> 38:02.864
sometime before
you actually die,

38:02.865 --> 38:04.032
somebody else dressing you.

38:04.033 --> 38:05.409
I see you in your later years...

38:06.410 --> 38:07.660
Having to be dressed.

38:07.661 --> 38:08.870
I will.
You will.

38:08.871 --> 38:11.039
And I'll be dressed by
a very attractive young nurse.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.791
Yeah, but you'll be able
to do nothing with her.

38:12.792 --> 38:14.209
You'll be able to do
absolutely nothing with her,

38:14.210 --> 38:15.543
'cause only your mind
you'll be like.

38:15.544 --> 38:16.753
The Diving Bell
and the Butterfly,

38:16.754 --> 38:18.379
and your mind will still be
as active as it is now.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.215
I'll still be able
to sort of clasp her hand

38:20.216 --> 38:21.549
as she walks away.

38:21.550 --> 38:23.092
No, there'll be no groping
at all,

38:23.093 --> 38:25.220
and that will absolutely
kill you from the inside,

38:25.221 --> 38:27.430
because she'll lean over you,
knowing,

38:27.431 --> 38:29.432
and she'll taunt you
with her breasts.

38:29.433 --> 38:31.184
And there'll be nothing
you can do.

38:31.185 --> 38:33.102
And I'd love to be there.
I would love to be there.

38:33.103 --> 38:34.646
I don't know what films
you've been watching.

38:34.647 --> 38:36.606
Do you know what I do?
I read for Steve.

38:36.607 --> 38:38.024
You heard what Rob Brydon
does for Steve?

38:38.025 --> 38:39.734
Steve is more or less
a vegetable,

38:39.735 --> 38:41.236
but Rob goes every day
and reads.

38:41.237 --> 38:43.655
And the only reason I do it
is to be there,

38:43.656 --> 38:47.534
watching you unable to reach out
to your Filipino nurse,

38:47.535 --> 38:49.829
knowing how much
it's hurting you.

38:53.332 --> 38:55.042
All right, just a quick one.

38:57.127 --> 38:58.837
Look at that hair.

38:58.838 --> 39:01.465
George Michael
in the Careless Whisper video.

39:02.842 --> 39:04.260
Why do we have to do this?

39:06.262 --> 39:07.763
A picture is worth
1,000 words.

39:11.100 --> 39:12.684
The sign says
go the other way.

39:12.685 --> 39:14.227
Yeah, but the sat nav said
go this way.

39:14.228 --> 39:15.311
Well, I think the signs
were right,

39:15.312 --> 39:16.897
and I'm the navigator.

39:18.941 --> 39:20.984
It would help if we got
over 4O miles an hour.

39:20.985 --> 39:22.694
All right.

39:22.695 --> 39:24.445
See how I changed down, then?
Yeah.

39:24.446 --> 39:25.864
I love the crunch sound

39:25.865 --> 39:28.284
that you made when you did it
as well.

39:29.285 --> 39:30.493
I'm hungry,
so let's just stop

39:30.494 --> 39:33.289
at the first place we come to.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.167
Care to explain this?

39:38.794 --> 39:40.795
Oi, here.

39:40.796 --> 39:43.298
What are you doing
with Casanova's autobiography

39:43.299 --> 39:45.091
in your sandwich box?

39:45.092 --> 39:46.968
It's just research. That's all.

39:46.969 --> 39:49.888
Just gonna plump up the articles
with a bit of, um

39:49.889 --> 39:51.848
bit of culture, you know.

39:51.849 --> 39:53.850
The, um
this is just extracts.

39:53.851 --> 39:56.185
The full thing is 800 pages.

39:56.186 --> 39:57.270
How long was your book,

39:57.271 --> 39:58.605
your autobiography?

39:58.606 --> 40:00.106
I can't remember.

40:00.107 --> 40:01.858
300? 200-and-something?
300?

40:01.859 --> 40:03.067
200 of that has
got to have been padding.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.110
There's not much padding.

40:04.111 --> 40:05.612
I'll be very honest with you.
Have you read it?

40:05.613 --> 40:06.779
No, of course not.
No.

40:06.780 --> 40:09.115
I mean, I've skimmed the index
in WHSmith's,

40:09.116 --> 40:11.118
saved myself the Â£1.99.

40:14.330 --> 40:15.371
Ah.

40:15.372 --> 40:16.748
Ravioli.

40:16.749 --> 40:17.749
I see.
Pasta.

40:17.750 --> 40:18.750
Grazie mille.

40:18.751 --> 40:20.168
You know we're not that far
from the hotel.

40:20.169 --> 40:21.544
You know that, don't you?
About 10 miles.

40:21.545 --> 40:22.754
I know.

40:22.755 --> 40:24.130
Because I checked a thing
called a map.

40:24.131 --> 40:26.007
It's what they used to use
in the olden days, Rob.

40:26.008 --> 40:27.634
Fine,
so when we get to the hotel,

40:27.635 --> 40:28.843
we'll enjoy the hotel.

40:28.844 --> 40:29.844
Yeah, I know.

40:29.845 --> 40:31.054
We could have been
eating there now.

40:31.055 --> 40:32.639
This is good.
What's wrong with this?

40:32.640 --> 40:33.848
Nothing wrong with it.

40:33.849 --> 40:35.142
This is good ravioli.

40:39.146 --> 40:40.563
He possessed two of the most

40:40.564 --> 40:42.899
important ingredients
of greatness:

40:42.900 --> 40:46.486
Total self-confidence
and super-abundant energy.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.988
He feared nobody.

40:48.989 --> 40:52.033
He was equally at home
in a palace or a tavern...

40:52.034 --> 40:53.284
Tick, tick, tick.

40:53.285 --> 40:55.161
A church or a brothel.
Tick.

40:55.162 --> 40:57.789
He was totally devoid
of a sense of morality.

40:57.790 --> 40:58.998
Love for him...
Well, that's not me.

40:58.999 --> 41:00.166
Had no connection with evil.

41:00.167 --> 41:02.335
It meant pleasure,
pure and simple.

41:02.336 --> 41:04.379
That's not me.
I've got a moral compass.

41:04.380 --> 41:06.047
Oh, yes,
you have a moral compass.

41:06.048 --> 41:07.800
It's just you don't know
where it is.

41:18.227 --> 41:19.268
Grazie.

41:19.269 --> 41:20.354
Prego.

41:21.647 --> 41:22.897
Hello.

41:22.898 --> 41:24.440
Hey.
How's it going?

41:24.441 --> 41:26.067
Great, great.
We're a bit.

41:26.068 --> 41:27.986
Well, it's all right.
We're a bit lost.

41:27.987 --> 41:30.780
Oh, dear.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

41:30.781 --> 41:32.198
Lam just calling
to remind you

41:32.199 --> 41:33.616
that I'm coming out
tomorrow...

41:33.617 --> 41:34.993
Oh, great.
That's good.

41:34.994 --> 41:38.246
With Yolanda,
the photographer.

41:38.247 --> 41:39.956
What, the same photographer
as last time?

41:39.957 --> 41:41.207
Yeah, um...

41:41.208 --> 41:43.126
ls-is that okay?

41:43.127 --> 41:45.003
Uh...
Well, who booked her?

41:45.004 --> 41:46.671
I don't know.
I think it was The Observer.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.214
Is that a problem?

41:48.215 --> 41:49.882
Because I could always
try and change it.

41:49.883 --> 41:53.052
No, no, that would be rude.

41:53.053 --> 41:55.138
No, just-we'll
I'm sure it'll be fine.

41:55.139 --> 41:56.222
All right, great.

41:56.223 --> 41:58.057
Good for you.

41:58.058 --> 41:59.642
All ligh t, Well, listen,
I 'II

41:59.643 --> 42:01.019
I'll see you tomorrow.
Can't wait.

42:01.020 --> 42:02.646
All right, lovey.
Take care. Ta-ra.

42:08.527 --> 42:11.237
So the photographer
who's coming tomorrow

42:11.238 --> 42:13.656
is the same one...

42:13.657 --> 42:14.699
we had last time.

42:14.700 --> 42:15.742
Really?

42:15.743 --> 42:17.493
Yeah.
Yolanda.

42:17.494 --> 42:18.619
Oh, the one you slept with?

42:18.620 --> 42:20.246
Yeah.
Oh.

42:20.247 --> 42:22.457
Is that gonna be awkward?

42:22.458 --> 42:24.417
Be interesting.

42:24.418 --> 42:25.878
How do you do it?

42:28.047 --> 42:29.297
Just take your trousers off.

42:29.298 --> 42:30.673
Serious question.

42:30.674 --> 42:33.010
And your underpants,
socks optional.

42:34.178 --> 42:35.887
I'm seriously asking you,
how do you do it?

42:35.888 --> 42:37.221
It's reputation.

42:37.222 --> 42:38.514
You're famous.

42:38.515 --> 42:39.724
No.

42:39.725 --> 42:42.351
Although
I don't see any reason to not

42:42.352 --> 42:45.480
use everything
you've got in your arsenal.

42:45.481 --> 42:47.440
People say, She only slept
with you 'cause you're famous.

42:47.441 --> 42:49.067
You say,
'Well, she only slept with you

42:49.068 --> 42:51.487
'cause you're good-looking
and young.

43:02.039 --> 43:03.039
Wow.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.290
Look at that.

43:04.291 --> 43:07.335
Isn't that beautiful?
Yeah.

43:07.336 --> 43:10.838
So you have reserved
the Duke of Genoa suite

43:10.839 --> 43:12.298
and the NapolÃ©on suite.

43:12.299 --> 43:13.674
Which is bigger?

43:13.675 --> 43:15.510
Oh, both are very nice.

43:15.511 --> 43:16.844
Yeah?
Yes.

43:16.845 --> 43:18.721
I think I should have
the NapolÃ©on.

43:18.722 --> 43:20.807
If it's based on height.

43:20.808 --> 43:21.934
Or complex.

43:23.727 --> 43:25.478
This is your sitting room.

43:25.479 --> 43:27.730
Right.

43:27.731 --> 43:29.273
And this is your bedroom.

43:29.274 --> 43:30.317
Mm.

43:32.736 --> 43:35.029
You have a beautiful view.

43:35.030 --> 43:38.324
Wow.
That is, uh...

43:38.325 --> 43:39.617
That's stunning.

43:39.618 --> 43:40.827
Yeah.

43:40.828 --> 43:43.454
I'm going to show your friend
his room.

43:43.455 --> 43:45.540
Okay.
Of course.

43:45.541 --> 43:47.083
I like your uniform.

43:47.084 --> 43:49.669
You look like an air stewardess.

43:49.670 --> 43:52.214
That's
that's in a good way.

43:53.632 --> 43:55.134
Eh.
You're a dick.

43:56.552 --> 43:58.052
Hi, Rob?
It's Donna.

43:58.053 --> 43:59.053
I'm just calling

43:59.054 --> 44:02.306
to check you got my email
with the script pages.

44:02.307 --> 44:03.641
No, uh, I haven't.

44:03.642 --> 44:05.643
What is it?
What's the part?

44:05.644 --> 44:07.061
It's a really good part.

44:07.062 --> 44:08.479
It's a supporting role,

44:08.480 --> 44:09.856
but you're gonna be great
in it

44:09.857 --> 44:11.399
because it's very sympathetic,

44:11.400 --> 44:14.068
and people will
will love you in it, really.

44:14.069 --> 44:16.445
You'll be playing an accountant
for the mob.

44:16.446 --> 44:17.655
Oh, brilliant.
All right.

44:17.656 --> 44:19.157
Um, comedy?

44:19.158 --> 44:21.576
No.
It's a thriller.

44:21.577 --> 44:23.578
Really?
Why ma?

44:23.579 --> 44:25.496
You're perfect for the part.

44:25.497 --> 44:26.998
You look like an accountant.

44:26.999 --> 44:30.084
And also, you're totally unknown
in America,

44:30.085 --> 44:31.711
which is what they want.

44:31.712 --> 44:33.838
Uh-huh, yes, very good.

44:33.839 --> 44:35.256
Yes, you've got
to put yourself on tape

44:35.257 --> 44:36.424
and email me.

44:36.425 --> 44:37.758
Yeah, I can do that.

44:37.759 --> 44:40.095
I can have it with you
by tomorrow.

44:41.180 --> 44:44.223
Che belle palazzo.

44:44.224 --> 44:46.350
It's the sort of place
that Byron would have rented.

44:46.351 --> 44:47.394
Mm.

44:49.605 --> 44:51.272
Ciao. Buonasera.

44:51.273 --> 44:54.317
Buonasera.

44:54.318 --> 44:57.028
She's got a lovely gait.

44:57.029 --> 44:58.822
Probably padlocked.

45:00.282 --> 45:01.365
Oh, yes.

45:01.366 --> 45:02.909
You know, there's very little

45:02.910 --> 45:06.954
separating Byron
from Brydon.

45:06.955 --> 45:08.331
Yeah.
Just a D.

45:08.332 --> 45:09.416
That's all there is.

45:10.959 --> 45:12.001
Yeah.

45:12.002 --> 45:14.337
But the almost anagram

45:14.338 --> 45:17.006
of your names
is the only thing

45:17.007 --> 45:18.758
that you really share,
isn't it?

45:18.759 --> 45:20.384
Because what Byron represented

45:20.385 --> 45:23.012
is probably
the antithesis of you, because

45:23.013 --> 45:25.473
he was shaking the tree
from the word go

45:25.474 --> 45:26.849
to when he popped his clogs,

45:26.850 --> 45:29.602
and that ain't you, mate.

45:29.603 --> 45:34.857
â™ª So we'll go
no more a-roving â™ª

45:34.858 --> 45:36.442
â™ª â™ª

45:36.443 --> 45:40.738
â™ª So late into the night â™ª

45:40.739 --> 45:42.448
When I imagined

45:42.449 --> 45:46.452
where we'd be
ten years ago,

45:46.453 --> 45:49.830
this is what I wanted.

45:49.831 --> 45:51.290
I love you.

45:51.291 --> 45:53.751
I love Izzy.
I love this house.

45:53.752 --> 45:55.002
You know'?

45:55.003 --> 45:56.671
You know.

45:56.672 --> 45:57.713
You know.

45:57.714 --> 45:58.965
You know.

45:58.966 --> 46:00.758
You know.
You-you know. You know.

46:00.759 --> 46:01.842
You know!

46:01.843 --> 46:02.927
You know.

46:02.928 --> 46:05.471
â™ª And the heart â™ª

46:05.472 --> 46:08.474
â™ª Must pause to breathe â™ª

46:08.475 --> 46:10.268
â™ª And love itself â™ª

46:10.269 --> 46:12.103
You know, I-I-I love you.

46:12.104 --> 46:15.273
And Izzy and the house, but

46:15.274 --> 46:17.900
but now-now we have it,
and I-l

46:17.901 --> 46:20.695
you know,
there's too much going on.

46:20.696 --> 46:22.697
Famous claustrophobic.

46:22.698 --> 46:25.032
Uh, there's too much
going on.

46:25.033 --> 46:28.119
I can't just close the door
and leave it behind, you know?

46:28.120 --> 46:30.831
My head has to be out there.

46:35.919 --> 46:37.503
I think it's very unlikely

46:37.504 --> 46:39.505
you'll get this part,

46:39.506 --> 46:41.299
and you have to come to terms
with this, I'm afraid.

46:41.300 --> 46:42.925
It's very unlikely.

46:42.926 --> 46:44.135
I know.

46:44.136 --> 46:45.970
Well, why you bother, then?

46:45.971 --> 46:47.596
Oh, you know, give it a go.

46:47.597 --> 46:49.598
But I think it's very unlikely.

46:49.599 --> 46:51.225
I know.

46:51.226 --> 46:53.436
Well, why are you doing it?

46:53.437 --> 46:55.062
Why are you doing it,

46:55.063 --> 46:58.232
you fucking idiot?

46:58.233 --> 46:59.984
'Cause I think I might get it.

46:59.985 --> 47:01.527
I think it's very unlikely

47:01.528 --> 47:02.737
that you'll get it.

47:02.738 --> 47:04.155
Why?

47:04.156 --> 47:05.489
Because you are

47:05.490 --> 47:07.409
an inferior talent.

47:12.622 --> 47:14.290
For you, sir.
Grazie mille.

47:14.291 --> 47:16.709
Prego.
Grazie.

47:16.710 --> 47:17.752
Prego, sir.

47:17.753 --> 47:19.170
Sleep well last night?

47:19.171 --> 47:20.338
Yeah. Like a baby.

47:20.339 --> 47:21.339
I didn't.

47:21.340 --> 47:22.965
Up worrying all night.

47:22.966 --> 47:24.425
Why?

47:24.426 --> 47:26.218
Been sent a script
for an American film.

47:26.219 --> 47:28.513
Got to put it on tape,
get it back to them today.

47:29.973 --> 47:31.515
What's the part?

47:31.516 --> 47:33.976
The lead
in a Michael Mann film.

47:33.977 --> 47:35.020
What?

47:36.021 --> 47:37.355
Really?
Yeah.

47:37.356 --> 47:38.564
Well, it's a mafia film.

47:38.565 --> 47:40.107
One of-one of
one of the leads.

47:40.108 --> 47:42.568
He's sort of
an easily led sort of guy

47:42.569 --> 47:45.446
who gets killed
at the second act.

47:45.447 --> 47:47.531
But you're Welsh.

47:47.532 --> 47:49.533
Lot of similarities between
the Welsh and the Italians.

47:49.534 --> 47:50.743
You know that.

47:50.744 --> 47:52.244
No, there aren't.
Yes, there are.

47:52.245 --> 47:54.246
Both love singing,
both short and swarthy,

47:54.247 --> 47:55.289
both love ice cream.

47:55.290 --> 47:56.707
There's loads of Italians
in Wales

47:56.708 --> 47:58.585
who run ice cream parlors.

48:01.713 --> 48:03.547
Are you-are you
are you winding me up?

48:03.548 --> 48:05.132
No.

48:05.133 --> 48:07.009
So will you help me
with the audition later?

48:07.010 --> 48:09.220
It's just an
it's just an audition.

48:09.221 --> 48:10.554
It's not an offer, is it?

48:10.555 --> 48:12.056
No, I've got
to put myself on tape.

48:12.057 --> 48:13.265
So will you help me?

48:13.266 --> 48:15.101
Help you
and read the other part?

48:15.102 --> 48:16.644
No, Alba's gonna read
the other part.

48:16.645 --> 48:18.187
' Who?

48:18.188 --> 48:19.688
Alba.
The receptionist.

48:19.689 --> 48:21.065
She's gonna read
the other part?

48:21.066 --> 48:22.191
Yeah.
It's a woman's part.

48:22.192 --> 48:24.026
How'd you wrangle that?

48:24.027 --> 48:26.028
I asked her.

48:26.029 --> 48:27.614
We rehearsed last night.

48:28.615 --> 48:29.698
She'll read.

48:29.699 --> 48:33.160
I just need you
to hold the camera.

48:33.161 --> 48:34.413
A nice shot.

48:36.581 --> 48:37.832
You're back?

48:37.833 --> 48:39.834
Working late-sorry.

48:39.835 --> 48:41.252
You want a drink?

48:41.253 --> 48:43.712
I was already in bed.

48:43.713 --> 48:45.089
Long night.

48:45.090 --> 48:46.507
When I used to imagine

48:46.508 --> 48:48.426
what we'd be doing
ten years ago...

48:48.427 --> 48:50.052
She'd be at school.

48:50.053 --> 48:52.054
This is it.

48:52.055 --> 48:53.764
I love you.

48:53.765 --> 48:56.058
I love Izzy.
I love this house.

48:56.059 --> 48:58.644
But now that we got it,
I can't enjoy it.

48:58.645 --> 49:00.896
There's too much going on
out there.

49:00.897 --> 49:04.067
My head has to be out there.

49:05.652 --> 49:07.361
Why don't we just get away,

49:07.362 --> 49:08.654
go to the lake house,

49:08.655 --> 49:11.240
just a few days,
like we used to?

49:11.241 --> 49:13.285
I can't right now.

49:15.871 --> 49:17.289
Mm.

49:18.457 --> 49:19.832
That's, um...

49:19.833 --> 49:21.333
Do you want to do it
like that?

49:21.334 --> 49:22.376
Why not?

49:22.377 --> 49:23.752
I think a sprinkling
of Al Pacino

49:23.753 --> 49:25.379
would be good, but you

49:25.380 --> 49:28.215
but do you really want
to be doing an impersonation?

49:28.216 --> 49:29.425
I want to do it like this.

49:29.426 --> 49:32.595
Mind you, they might not
recognize who you're doing,

49:32.596 --> 49:36.390
so there might be some method
in your madness.

49:36.391 --> 49:38.309
Well, I'm a method actor.

49:38.310 --> 49:41.896
There is method in my madness!

49:41.897 --> 49:43.898
That is Al!

49:43.899 --> 49:45.524
Al Pacino.

49:45.525 --> 49:48.111
Not what I was doing!

49:50.071 --> 49:52.616
Right, shall we do it again,
Mr. Kubrick?

49:53.617 --> 49:55.409
Alba, when Rob kisses you,

49:55.410 --> 49:57.328
you look very uncomfortable.

49:57.329 --> 49:58.496
No. I'm happy.
Yeah?

49:58.497 --> 49:59.955
I'm comfortable.

49:59.956 --> 50:02.125
Okay. Great.
Whenever you're ready.

50:05.128 --> 50:08.339
â™ª â™ª

50:08.340 --> 50:10.424
â™ª I'm broke,
but I'm happy â™ª

50:10.425 --> 50:13.469
â™ª I'm poor, but I'm kind â™ª

50:13.470 --> 50:15.846
â™ª I'm short,
but I'm healthy â™ª

50:15.847 --> 50:16.847
â™ª Yeah â™ª

50:16.848 --> 50:18.432
â™ª â™ª

50:18.433 --> 50:21.560
â™ª I'm high,
but I'm grounded â™ª

50:21.561 --> 50:24.104
â™ª I'm sane,
but I'm overwhelmed â™ª

50:24.105 --> 50:26.232
â™ª I'm lost,
but I'm hopeful â™ª

50:26.233 --> 50:27.650
â™ª Baby â™ª

50:27.651 --> 50:32.947
â™ª And what it all
comes down to â™ª

50:32.948 --> 50:37.326
â™ª Is that everything's gonna be
fine, fine, fine â™ª

50:37.327 --> 50:39.078
â™ª â™ª

50:39.079 --> 50:41.914
â™ª 'Cause I've got one hand
in my pocket â™ª

50:41.915 --> 50:45.876
â™ª And the other one
is giving a high five â™ª

50:45.877 --> 50:47.253
Yeah.
Keep your hands on the wheel.

50:47.254 --> 50:48.879
Well, that's what she
That's what she's saying.

50:48.880 --> 50:50.506
She's not driving the car,
though, with a passenger in it.

50:50.507 --> 50:51.549
Yeah, but she's like.

50:51.550 --> 50:52.675
Yeah,
if she were driving the car,

50:52.676 --> 50:53.842
I would say the same to her.

50:53.843 --> 50:56.512
Alanis, love, both hands
on the wheel, please.

50:56.513 --> 50:58.639
â™ª I'm working, yeah â™ª

50:58.640 --> 51:00.432
There is light
at the end of the tunnel.

51:00.433 --> 51:01.684
Yeah.
Yeah.

51:01.685 --> 51:02.893
Yeah,
but then just when you think

51:02.894 --> 51:04.270
everything's good,
all of a sudden...

51:04.271 --> 51:05.521
Then suddenly...
Out of nowhere...

51:05.522 --> 51:07.189
Out of nowhere,
you're in the dark again.

51:07.190 --> 51:09.817
â™ª Sorry, baby â™ª

51:09.818 --> 51:12.027
Right.
Now, then.

51:12.028 --> 51:13.445
Go-go left.
Go left. Go left.

51:13.446 --> 51:15.239
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
I can't go left.

51:15.240 --> 51:17.116
Fuck, fuck, fuck?

51:17.117 --> 51:18.492
You're being Hugh Grant.

51:18.493 --> 51:20.661
Fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck.

51:20.662 --> 51:23.372
That's no entry.

51:23.373 --> 51:24.957
Can we have the sat nav on
now, please?

51:24.958 --> 51:26.208
Okay.

51:26.209 --> 51:27.459
Where are you?

51:27.460 --> 51:28.919
Uh, we're
well, I think we're in

51:28.920 --> 51:30.796
we're in the outskirts of Rome.

51:30.797 --> 51:32.339
Right.
Well, we're-we're here.

51:32.340 --> 51:34.216
We've arrived already, so...

51:34.217 --> 51:36.176
She says that you follow
the signs for the center.

51:36.177 --> 51:37.553
We're near
the Piazza del Popolo.

51:37.554 --> 51:39.555
What signs?
There are no signs.

51:39.556 --> 51:41.140
If you follow signs
for the center...

51:41.141 --> 51:42.433
Guide us in.

51:42.434 --> 51:43.934
Ask her just to talk us in,

51:43.935 --> 51:46.895
like a stricken pilot
in an airliner.

51:46.896 --> 51:48.647
Have you not got your sat nav?

51:48.648 --> 51:51.775
It's having trouble
finding the, um, satellite.

51:51.776 --> 51:53.027
And go left.
Go left.

51:53.028 --> 51:54.361
I can't go left.

51:54.362 --> 51:56.655
There's a biker.
I'll kill him.

51:56.656 --> 51:58.532
Right, right.

51:58.533 --> 52:00.701
You got a right, right, right,
right up there, there.

52:00.702 --> 52:03.912
Whoa!
Bloody hell.

52:03.913 --> 52:06.165
This is where we're going,
right?

52:06.166 --> 52:07.541
That's where we want to be.

52:07.542 --> 52:08.917
You need to go round.

52:08.918 --> 52:10.336
Watch him. Watch him.
Watch the Smart car.

52:10.337 --> 52:11.795
Watch the Smart car!

52:11.796 --> 52:13.839
Oh!
Bloody hell.

52:13.840 --> 52:15.258
What's wrong with him?

52:17.010 --> 52:20.929
Right, go round this wall,
and get back inside.

52:20.930 --> 52:22.056
â™ª Fine â™ª

52:22.057 --> 52:23.891
â™ª â™ª

52:23.892 --> 52:25.726
â™ª 'Cause I've got one hand
in my pocket â™ª

52:25.727 --> 52:27.436
Yeah, yeah, this is it.
This is it.

52:27.437 --> 52:29.648
Oh, thank God for that.

52:32.484 --> 52:34.027
Fucking ridiculous.

52:36.655 --> 52:38.656
It's not like-it's not like
it's a new town.

52:38.657 --> 52:42.576
They've had 2,000 years
to sort out the traffic system.

52:42.577 --> 52:44.203
Are you gonna bring up
the suitcases?

52:44.204 --> 52:45.412
No.
They can do that.

52:45.413 --> 52:47.248
And they can park the car.

52:50.502 --> 52:51.877
Steve. Steve.

52:51.878 --> 52:53.295
Hey.
Hi. Hi.

52:53.296 --> 52:54.505
How you doing?

52:54.506 --> 52:55.506
Hello.
You all right?

52:55.507 --> 52:56.882
Yeah. It was a nightmare.
Hello.

52:56.883 --> 52:58.050
How are you?
You all right?

52:58.051 --> 52:59.134
Oh, God.
Good to see you.

52:59.135 --> 53:01.011
Nice to see you too.
You remember Yolanda?

53:01.012 --> 53:02.638
Yeah, hi. How are you?
Hi, Steve. Nice to see you.

53:02.639 --> 53:04.598
How are you?
Careful. I'm very, very sweaty.

53:04.599 --> 53:06.058
Yeah.
Looking good.

53:06.059 --> 53:07.851
Thank you.
Nice dress. Lady in Red.

53:07.852 --> 53:09.478
Terrible song.

53:09.479 --> 53:10.604
Well, you've made it
in the end.

53:10.605 --> 53:12.564
You're here now.
Yes, all roads lead to Rome.

53:12.565 --> 53:13.816
Absolutely.

53:13.817 --> 53:15.618
All the ones we were on
went round in circles.

53:22.701 --> 53:23.909
Oh, no, thank you.

53:23.910 --> 53:25.577
Sorry.
I'm-I'm okay.

53:25.578 --> 53:27.371
You're not gonna have
a glass of wine?

53:27.372 --> 53:29.164
Come on. We're all gonna have
a glass of wine.

53:29.165 --> 53:31.375
Yeah.
No, I-l can't.

53:31.376 --> 53:33.044
Uh...
You on the wagon?

53:34.045 --> 53:36.880
I can't,
um, because I'm pregnant.

53:36.881 --> 53:38.090
Oh, my God.
Really?

53:38.091 --> 53:39.758
Congratulations.
Wow.

53:39.759 --> 53:41.176
Thank you.

53:41.177 --> 53:43.220
Wow.
No, um...

53:43.221 --> 53:44.638
That's fantastic.
Thanks.

53:44.639 --> 53:45.848
Well, congratulations.

53:45.849 --> 53:47.349
Yeah, no, um
How far gone?

53:47.350 --> 53:48.934
About 31/2 months.

53:48.935 --> 53:50.436
Wow.
So, yeah.

53:50.437 --> 53:52.521
Why? Did you just think
I'd gotten fat?

53:52.522 --> 53:54.022
Well, I didn't like to say.

53:54.023 --> 53:55.399
Well, you-you look good.

53:55.400 --> 53:57.401
No, you're blooming.
I was.

53:57.402 --> 53:58.986
Blooming is what you say

53:58.987 --> 54:00.738
when you think
they're packing a few pounds.

54:00.739 --> 54:01.739
No, no, you are.

54:01.740 --> 54:02.948
I thought
you're either pregnant

54:02.949 --> 54:04.950
or you're depressed.

54:04.951 --> 54:06.161
And you're eating.

54:09.956 --> 54:11.082
Service.

54:14.627 --> 54:15.669
Grazie.

54:15.670 --> 54:17.129
Prego.
Grazie.

54:17.130 --> 54:18.797
Pasta's perfect.
Very delicate.

54:18.798 --> 54:20.257
You can tell
that's handmade pasta.

54:20.258 --> 54:21.300
You can tell, can't you?

54:21.301 --> 54:23.594
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

54:23.595 --> 54:25.512
What's the food been like
so far in Italy,

54:25.513 --> 54:27.514
compared to the food
in the Lakes?

54:27.515 --> 54:28.766
A lot of pasta.
A lot of pasta.

54:28.767 --> 54:29.933
Yeah.

54:29.934 --> 54:31.560
You can't do the Atkins diet
on this trip.

54:31.561 --> 54:32.770
That's for sure.

54:32.771 --> 54:34.354
Well, you are
you are in Italy.

54:34.355 --> 54:36.732
I'm gonna channel
my inner Julia Roberts

54:36.733 --> 54:38.025
in Eat Pray Love

54:38.026 --> 54:40.653
and get in touch
with my love of pasta.

54:45.241 --> 54:46.283
We were gonna go to Naples

54:46.284 --> 54:48.202
'cause Shelley lived there,
Casanova,

54:48.203 --> 54:50.412
but he's put the kibosh
on that, so now

54:50.413 --> 54:51.872
I just wanted
a bit of glamour.

54:51.873 --> 54:54.416
In my head, I thought
we'd get a bit of glamour,

54:54.417 --> 54:56.752
a bit of, you know, like, um,
Dolce Vita,

54:56.753 --> 54:57.878
Anita Ekberg and Marcello.

54:57.879 --> 54:59.254
Ooh, yeah,
in the Trevi Fountain.

54:59.255 --> 55:00.464
Um, what's his name?

55:00.465 --> 55:03.258
Marcello Mastroianni.

55:03.259 --> 55:05.719
Very cross when I told him
I couldn't deliver Anita Ekberg.

55:05.720 --> 55:06.970
He-he had
one of his fits then.

55:06.971 --> 55:08.180
Driving along in a TR3

55:08.181 --> 55:09.556
with a cigarette hanging out
the corner of his mouth.

55:09.557 --> 55:11.183
'Ciao, belle.'

55:11.184 --> 55:12.893
Well, the cigarette
might fall out if you said that.

55:12.894 --> 55:14.895
We were gonna go there,
but he doesn't want to.

55:14.896 --> 55:17.147
So instead, we're going
to the Amalfi Coast.

55:17.148 --> 55:18.649
Nice.
Pompeii. Sicily.

55:18.650 --> 55:19.691
Oh.
Why Sicily?

55:19.692 --> 55:21.652
Why Sicily?

55:21.653 --> 55:22.820
Yeah.

55:22.821 --> 55:24.029
You're asking me why?

55:24.030 --> 55:25.155
She's asking you

55:25.156 --> 55:26.615
what it's got to do
with Shelley and Byron.

55:26.616 --> 55:27.783
To Sicily?

55:27.784 --> 55:29.076
Let me tell you.

55:29.077 --> 55:30.494
Nothing is the answer.

55:30.495 --> 55:32.913
Sicily is the home

55:32.914 --> 55:34.039
of The Godfather.

55:34.040 --> 55:35.082
Of course.

55:35.083 --> 55:36.375
We think
of going to Sicily

55:36.376 --> 55:38.627
because it's where
The Godfather began,

55:38.628 --> 55:40.337
you know, in Corleone.

55:40.338 --> 55:41.630
I want to have a homage.

55:41.631 --> 55:43.298
Sounds like you're deaf.
A pilgrimage.

55:43.299 --> 55:45.343
I love you very much.

55:46.344 --> 55:48.679
He knows very well
I'm not doing a deaf person.

55:48.680 --> 55:52.058
I normally like
your impressions quite a lot.

55:53.434 --> 55:54.476
That's not his voice.

55:54.477 --> 55:55.686
It's more like that.

55:55.687 --> 55:57.020
I know that's not his voice
either.

55:57.021 --> 55:58.438
It's a deaf person.
Well, you show me the voice.

55:58.439 --> 55:59.648
Show me the voice.
I can't do the voice.

55:59.649 --> 56:01.024
All I know is that
that's the deaf person.

56:01.025 --> 56:02.818
Come on, you can do
Marlon Brando, can't you?

56:02.819 --> 56:04.361
Come on, Steve.
You can do it.

56:04.362 --> 56:05.779
Let's have a Marlon-off.
Come on.

56:05.780 --> 56:06.989
Let's hear your Marlon.

56:06.990 --> 56:09.408
Let's even things out now
with your Marlon.

56:09.409 --> 56:10.868
You need to put bread
in your cheeks.

56:10.869 --> 56:12.160
Careful.
That's crusty bread.

56:12.161 --> 56:13.537
He finds
some of the crustier bread

56:13.538 --> 56:14.746
a little difficult these days.

56:14.747 --> 56:15.789
I cut it up for him.

56:15.790 --> 56:16.957
Oh, you have to puree it
for him.

56:16.958 --> 56:18.417
Yeah, I cut it up for him,
yeah, gonna be good.

56:18.418 --> 56:19.502
Okay.
Oh, there you go.

56:21.212 --> 56:22.629
Oh, now, there you have it.

56:22.630 --> 56:24.298
It's like going to the dentist.

56:24.299 --> 56:25.299
You what?
What?

56:25.300 --> 56:26.466
It's like
going to the dentist.

56:26.467 --> 56:27.467
Say again?

56:27.468 --> 56:28.927
You wondered
where your tent is?

56:28.928 --> 56:30.053
What?

56:30.054 --> 56:31.889
Send reinforcements.

56:31.890 --> 56:34.600
We're going to
send reinforcements.

56:34.601 --> 56:35.809
We're going to advance.

56:35.810 --> 56:37.436
Send three and four pence.

56:37.437 --> 56:38.437
We're going to a dance?

56:38.438 --> 56:39.564
Thank you very much.

56:43.484 --> 56:44.526
Go on.

56:44.527 --> 56:46.528
You do the-do it, Rob,
the background.

56:46.529 --> 56:48.155
The whole time, you know,

56:48.156 --> 56:49.865
I just bite my tongue,
you know,

56:49.866 --> 56:52.952
and, hey,
don't call me Godfather.

56:54.120 --> 56:55.329
What is it you're playing,
Steve?

56:55.330 --> 56:56.830
Mandolin.
Mandolin.

56:56.831 --> 56:57.998
Was it a miniature mandolin?

56:57.999 --> 56:59.875
Are they all that size?
Are they all that small?

56:59.876 --> 57:01.961
They're very small, yeah.
Have you seen a mandolin?

57:08.885 --> 57:10.135
Service.

57:10.136 --> 57:12.346
Shall we begin?
Yes, I think we shall.

57:12.347 --> 57:14.348
Let's let the expectant mother
set us off.

57:14.349 --> 57:16.016
Okay.

57:16.017 --> 57:18.435
And so she plunges the knife
into the John Dory.

57:18.436 --> 57:19.811
Ouch, says the fish.

57:19.812 --> 57:20.855
Oh, don't!
And we're away!

57:22.023 --> 57:23.148
Fantastic.
Mmm.

57:23.149 --> 57:24.399
Mary Shelley, I think,

57:24.400 --> 57:25.692
was the most interesting
of all of them.

57:25.693 --> 57:26.693
I agree.

57:26.694 --> 57:28.904
I absolutely loved
Frankenstein.

57:28.905 --> 57:30.697
She was more successful
than her husband.

57:30.698 --> 57:32.532
She was.
She was way more successful.

57:32.533 --> 57:33.951
Probably why Shelley had

57:33.952 --> 57:36.078
so many affairs
with so many women,

57:36.079 --> 57:37.704
probably just jealous of her.

57:37.705 --> 57:40.290
And he slept
with her stepsister Claire.

57:40.291 --> 57:42.584
Mary and Shelley together
they had five kids.

57:42.585 --> 57:45.545
Four of them were lost
before he drowned, though.

57:45.546 --> 57:46.922
That's why they left Rome,

57:46.923 --> 57:49.925
was because William had malaria.

57:49.926 --> 57:51.593
Ugh,
it must have been horrific

57:51.594 --> 57:53.387
having kids in those days.

57:53.388 --> 57:55.597
Yes, well, talking about
Frankenstein, of course,

57:55.598 --> 57:58.058
brings to mind my dear friend
Sir Kenneth Branagh

57:58.059 --> 58:00.894
and his production
of Frankenstein with De Niro.

58:00.895 --> 58:03.063
I got a

58:03.064 --> 58:05.732
I got a-l got a bolt
in my neck.

58:05.733 --> 58:07.192
Got to get a bolt...

58:07.193 --> 58:08.944
Got to get the bolt
out of my neck.

58:08.945 --> 58:10.362
Got to get this bolt
out of my neck.

58:10.363 --> 58:11.780
Good God.

58:11.781 --> 58:13.532
He's got a big bolt
in his neck.

58:13.533 --> 58:15.617
Pop a cap in his crazy ass.

58:15.618 --> 58:17.244
I can't get it out.

58:17.245 --> 58:19.121
Bloody hell.
That's not-that's subtle.

58:19.122 --> 58:20.372
Lookit.
You're bursting.

58:20.373 --> 58:21.999
Robert here
is trying to divert you

58:22.000 --> 58:23.500
from the fact that
he can't do Robert De Niro

58:23.501 --> 58:24.626
because he doesn't know
how to do it,

58:24.627 --> 58:26.169
speak through the nose
like that.

58:26.170 --> 58:27.421
You know,
you got to get that sound,

58:27.422 --> 58:29.214
talking through his nose
like that, you know?

58:29.215 --> 58:31.133
And the whole
facial gesture thing

58:31.134 --> 58:32.551
that's
that's all part of it, you know?

58:32.552 --> 58:33.760
Yeah, that's a bit
more familiar.

58:33.761 --> 58:35.303
Talk like that, you know'?

58:35.304 --> 58:36.513
That's the way he talks.

58:36.514 --> 58:37.931
Hey, Frank,
what you got in your neck'?

58:37.932 --> 58:39.141
You got something in your neck.

58:39.142 --> 58:40.976
What's that thing
sticking out of your neck?

58:40.977 --> 58:42.602
I got some goddamn bolts
in my goddamn fucking neck.

58:42.603 --> 58:43.770
You shut the fuck up,
or I'll rip your head off,

58:43.771 --> 58:45.230
shit down
your goddamn fucking neck,

58:45.231 --> 58:47.858
you stupid bitch-sucking
motherfucking asshole.

58:47.859 --> 58:49.736
That's how he
he speaks like that.

58:51.029 --> 58:52.112
It was like
watching the video.

58:52.113 --> 58:53.780
I don't remember that
from Frankenstein.

58:53.781 --> 58:55.407
Was that on the extras?

58:55.408 --> 58:58.619
Oh, you have to buy
the box set to see that?

59:03.708 --> 59:05.459
You know, Shelley wrote,

59:05.460 --> 59:08.045
it could make one
fall in love with death,

59:08.046 --> 59:10.881
to be buried
in so beautiful a place.

59:10.882 --> 59:13.258
And within a year,
he was dead.

59:13.259 --> 59:15.677
Well, be careful
what you wish for.

59:15.678 --> 59:18.180
It is lovely, though.

59:18.181 --> 59:19.474
There's Shelley.

59:21.267 --> 59:22.559
Wow.

59:22.560 --> 59:24.770
Nothing of him
that doth fade,

59:24.771 --> 59:26.396
but doth suffer a sea change

59:26.397 --> 59:30.025
into something
rich and strange.

59:30.026 --> 59:32.235
Defying the physical, isn't it?
Transcendent.

59:32.236 --> 59:33.278
Yeah.

59:33.279 --> 59:35.405
Here's Trelawney.

59:35.406 --> 59:37.657
His poetry lives on
in a way that.

59:37.658 --> 59:40.660
These are two friends
whose lives were undivided.

59:40.661 --> 59:42.747
Trelawney died aged 88.

59:43.915 --> 59:45.332
What-Shelley was what, 26?

59:45.333 --> 59:47.001
So that's 62 years
they were divided.

59:48.044 --> 59:50.003
And he
and he bought this plot

59:50.004 --> 59:52.297
'cause he maintained the grave.

59:52.298 --> 59:53.715
And he bought the boat
that sank

59:53.716 --> 59:55.133
that killed Shelley.

59:55.134 --> 59:56.885
So it's a bit rich,
him burying himself next to him.

59:56.886 --> 59:58.637
He spent his whole life
dining out on the fact

59:58.638 --> 01:00:00.097
that he knew
Byron and Shelley

01:00:00.098 --> 01:00:02.183
and claimed to know Keats,
which he didn't.

01:00:03.601 --> 01:00:05.602
Steve, look at the book.

01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:07.437
Good.
Okay, now I'm looking away.

01:00:07.438 --> 01:00:09.606
I'm thinking.
Uh-huh.

01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:12.400
The light here is great.

01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:15.445
My favorite film
is Roman Holiday.

01:00:15.446 --> 01:00:16.488
Oh, yes.

01:00:16.489 --> 01:00:17.739
Do you remember Gregory Peck?

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:18.865
Of course.

01:00:18.866 --> 01:00:21.201
He had his flat
in number 51 Via Margutta.

01:00:21.202 --> 01:00:22.285
Yes.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:23.537
This is Via Margutta.

01:00:23.538 --> 01:00:24.663
Seriously?

01:00:24.664 --> 01:00:26.414
Yeah. This is it.
Wow.

01:00:26.415 --> 01:00:29.292
And do you remember he took
her upstairs, and he said.

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:30.794
No, she said
when she got up there

01:00:30.795 --> 01:00:32.921
'cause it was so tiny,
and she's like,

01:00:32.922 --> 01:00:34.589
Is this the elevator?

01:00:34.590 --> 01:00:35.882
Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:35.883 --> 01:00:37.092
I love Audrey Hepburn

01:00:37.093 --> 01:00:38.260
and Ingrid Bergman.

01:00:38.261 --> 01:00:39.511
Keats. Shelley.

01:00:39.512 --> 01:00:40.929
Brilliant,
brilliant actresses.

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:42.889
La Dolce Vita.
Si.

01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:44.850
Well, actually, most people
think La Dolce Vita

01:00:44.851 --> 01:00:46.852
is about the glamour of Rome,
but it's about the opposite.

01:00:46.853 --> 01:00:48.145
It's about...
Yeah.

01:00:48.146 --> 01:00:49.312
The emptiness of that life,

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:50.397
the superficiality.

01:00:50.398 --> 01:00:51.481
Yeah.
Vacuous people.

01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:52.566
Mm-hmm.

01:00:52.567 --> 01:00:55.068
The term paparazzi

01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:56.862
comes from the film
Dolce Vita.

01:00:56.863 --> 01:00:57.904
That's where it came from?

01:00:57.905 --> 01:00:59.114
Of course, in Roman Holiday,

01:00:59.115 --> 01:01:01.241
Gregory Peck
plays the journalist,

01:01:01.242 --> 01:01:04.077
and his photographer friend
is played by Eddie Albert.

01:01:04.078 --> 01:01:06.788
Yes, with his Zippo lighter.
Yes.

01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:08.916
Which is where the term
Eddie Alberto comes from.

01:01:20.887 --> 01:01:22.179
Hello?

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.598
Rob?
It-it's Lucy.

01:01:24.599 --> 01:01:26.224
So tell me about
are you still seeing that guy?

01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:28.018
What's his name?
Roberto.

01:01:28.019 --> 01:01:29.186
Roberto.

01:01:29.187 --> 01:01:31.396
Roberto Brydono.
I'm sorry.

01:01:31.397 --> 01:01:32.731
A horrible thought.
Go on.

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:34.399
Hello?
Can you-can you hear me?

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.109
Yeah.
How are you?

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:39.237
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

01:01:39.238 --> 01:01:41.406
Um...
I've been missing you.

01:01:41.407 --> 01:01:44.326
Oh, well, I-l, um

01:01:44.327 --> 01:01:45.786
I've missed you too.

01:01:46.913 --> 01:01:48.246
Really?

01:01:48.247 --> 01:01:49.789
Yeah.

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:53.043
I-I mean, I've been missing
Hugh Grant as well.

01:01:53.044 --> 01:01:54.252
Well, yes, of course.

01:01:54.253 --> 01:01:56.004
I mean, it's a terrible loss.

01:01:56.005 --> 01:01:57.505
I think we'll all miss him.

01:01:57.506 --> 01:01:59.132
I'm sure that-that,

01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:02.636
were he here now, he-he would
apologize profusely,

01:02:02.637 --> 01:02:04.846
uh, for his, uh, absence.

01:02:04.847 --> 01:02:08.934
And I daresay, he-he would
delight at the prospect of

01:02:08.935 --> 01:02:12.938
of dropping anchor,
uh, once again, in, um

01:02:12.939 --> 01:02:16.942
in, uh-in Lucy, um, Cove,
if that's not too,

01:02:16.943 --> 01:02:19.277
uh, inopportune, uh, sort of.

01:02:19.278 --> 01:02:20.862
Uh. Yeah.

01:02:20.863 --> 01:02:22.073
Oh, you laughed.
Thank God.

01:02:23.991 --> 01:02:27.369
It would be lovely to
see you again, if you wanted.

01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:28.662
Yes, it would, wouldn't it?

01:02:28.663 --> 01:02:30.288
Yes, um-yeah.

01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:32.540
How do we-how can we do that?

01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:34.709
Well, I don't know.

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:36.711
Um... where are you?

01:02:36.712 --> 01:02:38.129
Uh, Rome.

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:39.673
Ah, I see.

01:02:39.674 --> 01:02:42.884
Well, um, look,
shall I call you again?

01:02:42.885 --> 01:02:44.094
Yeah.
Would you mind?

01:02:44.095 --> 01:02:45.220
Is that a good idea?

01:02:45.221 --> 01:02:46.805
Absolutely, yes.
That would be good.

01:02:46.806 --> 01:02:49.766
I'd accept the call,
definitely.

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:51.184
It's nice to see you.
It's nice to see you too.

01:02:51.185 --> 01:02:52.394
Yeah, yeah.
You look fantastic.

01:02:52.395 --> 01:02:53.812
Thank you.

01:02:53.813 --> 01:02:56.439
There's something
in your hair.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.108
Good.
Well, I'll call you soon, then.

01:02:58.109 --> 01:02:59.234
All right, bye, Lucy.

01:02:59.235 --> 01:03:00.278
3Y9. Bye-bye.
Bye.

01:03:08.953 --> 01:03:11.246
So how did it go last night
with Yolanda?

01:03:11.247 --> 01:03:13.123
Good.
Mission accomplished.

01:03:13.124 --> 01:03:16.835
Everyone's happy at,
uh, Houston Ground Control.

01:03:16.836 --> 01:03:20.088
Small panic when I disappeared
round the dark side of moon.

01:03:20.089 --> 01:03:21.298
Oh!

01:03:21.299 --> 01:03:23.008
We lost communication.

01:03:23.009 --> 01:03:26.928
But both of us achieved
a very satisfactory splashdown,

01:03:26.929 --> 01:03:28.346
and, at which point,

01:03:28.347 --> 01:03:31.308
Houston broke into
a round of applause.

01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:35.186
When Vesuvius erupted,
it just went bang!

01:03:35.187 --> 01:03:38.732
And-a cacophonous bang.

01:03:38.733 --> 01:03:40.483
They would've seen
a plume of smoke, just

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:41.944
just boom,
right from back there.

01:03:43.237 --> 01:03:45.322
And a cloud
going up into the sky.

01:03:45.323 --> 01:03:47.949
30,000 Hiroshima bombs,
200 megatons

01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:50.618
imagine that loud a sound.

01:03:50.619 --> 01:03:54.205
This whole city's preserved
in formaldehyde,

01:03:54.206 --> 01:03:55.957
like this artificial

01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:57.459
that's why it's so remarkable.

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.627
It's like a photograph
of the past.

01:03:59.628 --> 01:04:02.297
It's a sculpture of the past.

01:04:02.298 --> 01:04:04.257
Well, you know,
a sculpture is an impression.

01:04:04.258 --> 01:04:05.633
A photograph-that's reality.

01:04:05.634 --> 01:04:08.011
Yeah,
but a sculpture is 3-D.

01:04:08.012 --> 01:04:09.763
A photograph is 2-D.

01:04:09.764 --> 01:04:11.181
Uh... yeah.

01:04:11.182 --> 01:04:12.932
Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
Yeah. All right.

01:04:12.933 --> 01:04:14.559
Yeah,
these people just are caught

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.144
frozen in their death throes.

01:04:16.145 --> 01:04:17.562
Look at his sandal.
Wow.

01:04:17.563 --> 01:04:18.980
They're like yours.

01:04:18.981 --> 01:04:20.357
They are, aren't they?
Yeah, they are.

01:04:20.358 --> 01:04:21.775
It shows you
that even 2,000 years ago,

01:04:21.776 --> 01:04:23.818
there were people
with bad dress sense.

01:04:23.819 --> 01:04:26.363
For me,
the big question is,

01:04:26.364 --> 01:04:27.990
how did he get in the box?

01:04:30.785 --> 01:04:32.118
Was he an illusionist?

01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:36.206
Was he a sort of
David Blaine of his day?

01:04:36.207 --> 01:04:37.665
But it is incredible, 'cause,

01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:39.584
look, he's gone in;
He's sealed it.

01:04:39.585 --> 01:04:42.004
He's like that guy they found
in the holdall in the bath.

01:04:45.591 --> 01:04:48.218
It's a small man in a box.

01:04:48.219 --> 01:04:49.344
Here I am.

01:04:49.345 --> 01:04:50.345
Oh, my word.

01:04:50.346 --> 01:04:51.763
How did I get in here?

01:04:51.764 --> 01:04:54.099
I can see the volcano erupting,

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:57.894
and I am petrified.

01:04:57.895 --> 01:04:59.187
The thing is, he was real.

01:04:59.188 --> 01:05:02.482
He was
this is a real man who died.

01:05:02.483 --> 01:05:04.150
I wonder if anyone cried
for him.

01:05:04.151 --> 01:05:06.236
I wonder if anyone who escaped

01:05:06.237 --> 01:05:08.655
loved him
and cried about him.

01:05:08.656 --> 01:05:10.241
'We didn't get on.

01:05:20.334 --> 01:05:24.087
It seems like he's a little
oversensitive to me.

01:05:24.088 --> 01:05:26.297
I agree.

01:05:26.298 --> 01:05:28.299
Are you knocking about
with him?

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.760
Yeah, we're just
traveling round Italy.

01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:32.345
Oh, my God.

01:05:32.346 --> 01:05:34.264
It must be a nightmare
for you.

01:05:34.265 --> 01:05:35.682
It really is.

01:05:35.683 --> 01:05:36.850
In many ways, I envy you.

01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:38.435
You're inside the box.

01:05:38.436 --> 01:05:40.854
I mean, at least for you,
it's muffled.

01:05:40.855 --> 01:05:42.856
Yeah, I'm just
picking up the odd word,

01:05:42.857 --> 01:05:44.065
to be honest with you,

01:05:44.066 --> 01:05:45.859
but, you know,
in all honesty,

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.861
I'm kind of glad
I died when I did,

01:05:47.862 --> 01:05:50.655
and I never got the chance
to meet the guy.

01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:52.615
I know. I know.

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:54.868
If I could climb in there
with you,

01:05:54.869 --> 01:05:56.411
I would.

01:05:56.412 --> 01:05:58.037
Anyway, it's been really good
to talk.

01:05:58.038 --> 01:05:59.831
Yeah, you too, fella.

01:05:59.832 --> 01:06:01.249
What's that?

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:03.460
I just said
I love your sandals.

01:06:03.461 --> 01:06:04.878
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:06:04.879 --> 01:06:07.006
I like yours too.
Take it easy.

01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:22.430
â™ª â™ª

01:06:56.013 --> 01:06:58.181
We're a bit late.
Sorry. Sorry.

01:06:58.182 --> 01:06:59.557
Hello.
I think we're in row nine.

01:06:59.558 --> 01:07:00.559
Sorry.

01:07:01.977 --> 01:07:04.437
This is the review
from Marie Claire.

01:07:04.438 --> 01:07:06.439
'We head instead to
the green tip of the peninsula,

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.149
to the Relais Blu Belvedere,

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:10.360
a beautiful, modernist
boutique hotel

01:07:10.361 --> 01:07:12.237
tucked away
high above the sea.

01:07:12.238 --> 01:07:14.781
The marvelous terrace
for summer service

01:07:14.782 --> 01:07:16.824
has a superb view of Capri.

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:18.993
Dishes with the flavors
of Campania

01:07:18.994 --> 01:07:21.622
enhanced with skill
and inventiveness.

01:07:29.547 --> 01:07:31.422
Serving linguini pasta
for you, sir,

01:07:31.423 --> 01:07:33.424
with bluefish and fresh tomato.

01:07:33.425 --> 01:07:34.425
Grazie.

01:07:34.426 --> 01:07:35.593
For you, sir,
is a homemade ravioli

01:07:35.594 --> 01:07:36.678
with rockfish and pepper.

01:07:36.679 --> 01:07:37.680
Grazie mille.

01:07:38.722 --> 01:07:39.765
Hmm.

01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:45.771
Oh, my God.

01:07:47.982 --> 01:07:49.315
Not good?

01:07:49.316 --> 01:07:50.692
That's fantastic.

01:07:50.693 --> 01:07:51.818
Very, very nice.

01:07:51.819 --> 01:07:53.486
You know what would
make this perfect now'?

01:07:53.487 --> 01:07:55.446
Michael BublÃ©.
Bit of BublÃ©.

01:07:55.447 --> 01:07:56.781
Do you like BublÃ©?

01:07:56.782 --> 01:07:58.199
Where do you stand
on Michael BublÃ©?

01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.867
His windpipe.

01:07:59.868 --> 01:08:01.036
You don't mean that.

01:08:02.121 --> 01:08:04.080
Parkinson loves him.
Michael BublÃ©!

01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:05.248
Michael BublÃ©.

01:08:05.249 --> 01:08:06.583
Michael BublÃ©.
Michael BublÃ©.

01:08:06.584 --> 01:08:07.917
Michael BublÃ©.
Michael BublÃ©.

01:08:07.918 --> 01:08:09.836
Michael BublÃ©.
Real music.

01:08:09.837 --> 01:08:11.254
Real music.
Ah, wonderful.

01:08:11.255 --> 01:08:13.214
My guest today is Steve Coogan.

01:08:13.215 --> 01:08:16.050
Steve, I mean,
you're in comedy.

01:08:16.051 --> 01:08:18.595
I mean, for you,
character comedian,

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:20.638
maybe, you know,
your roots in the north, you.

01:08:20.639 --> 01:08:22.015
Yeah. Yeah.

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:23.808
I suppose for you,
Peter Kay

01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:26.519
Peter Kay, I suppose,
would be the benchmark.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.520
I wouldn't call him
the benchmark; I'd say he's.

01:08:28.522 --> 01:08:30.564
Sacha Baron Cohen
would be another one, I suppose.

01:08:30.566 --> 01:08:33.109
I mean, Sacha
I had him on the show.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.111
He's a strange man,
a curious man.

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:36.404
He is a little, yeah.

01:08:36.404 --> 01:08:38.031
Do you watch him,
and do you take inspiration

01:08:38.032 --> 01:08:39.616
from Sacha Baron Cohen?

01:08:39.617 --> 01:08:41.283
I think we all take
inspiration from each other

01:08:41.285 --> 01:08:42.660
when you're at a certain level.

01:08:42.661 --> 01:08:44.245
I suppose the benchmark
is Gervais.

01:08:44.246 --> 01:08:45.537
I mean, The Office

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:47.582
and Extras,

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:49.626
Life is Short
I mean, all of these programs.

01:08:49.627 --> 01:08:51.377
But Life is Short,
maybe some people

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:53.254
didn't think was so good,
but that's by the by.

01:08:53.255 --> 01:08:54.464
But to be the first man
to put a dwarf

01:08:54.465 --> 01:08:55.881
on mainstream television

01:08:55.883 --> 01:08:57.466
I mean, it was quite
an achievement, wasn't it?

01:08:57.468 --> 01:08:59.636
Yeah, well, if you look at it
that way, but, you know

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:00.886
I love Simon Pegg.

01:09:00.888 --> 01:09:04.098
I mean, I watch him in
the Star Trek films, you know.

01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:05.515
Yeah, I haven't seen them,

01:09:05.517 --> 01:09:07.060
but I'm told
they're very good,

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.895
and, as I said,
I'm delighted for his success.

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:10.313
And to work with Tom Cruise,

01:09:10.314 --> 01:09:12.148
as he does in
Impossible.

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:13.149
I mean, imagine working
with Tom Cruise.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.192
Yeah, well,
I have worked with Tom Cruise.

01:09:14.193 --> 01:09:15.193
I worked on Tropic Thunder.

01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:17.612
Yes, you died in
the first ten minutes, Steve.

01:09:17.613 --> 01:09:19.113
You died
in the first ten minutes.

01:09:19.113 --> 01:09:21.198
I died in the first ten minutes.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.867
I felt you died
in the first five minutes,

01:09:22.868 --> 01:09:24.702
in all honesty,
but that's just my view.

01:09:24.703 --> 01:09:26.287
We'll come back to Steve.

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:28.082
Here's Michael BublÃ©
with a new record.

01:09:30.167 --> 01:09:31.376
When we think about you,

01:09:31.377 --> 01:09:32.710
we think about the '90s,
don't we?

01:09:32.711 --> 01:09:34.504
Yeah-what?
We think about the '90s.

01:09:34.505 --> 01:09:35.671
What a wonderful period
that was.

01:09:35.673 --> 01:09:38.091
We think Oasis, Blur.

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:40.676
You're smacked off your tits
in a central London hotel

01:09:40.678 --> 01:09:41.928
trying to get your life
together.

01:09:41.929 --> 01:09:43.429
But you've turned it around now,
haven't you?

01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:44.680
Tell us about your recovery.

01:09:44.682 --> 01:09:45.723
Well, I'd rather not.

01:09:45.724 --> 01:09:47.433
I'd rather talk about
me new film.

01:09:47.434 --> 01:09:48.768
'Cause you are still acting.
I think

01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:50.060
I want that to come across
for the viewers.

01:09:50.062 --> 01:09:51.062
I want them to know.

01:09:51.063 --> 01:09:52.689
Yeah.
I've done a lot of things.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:53.898
I've done some brand-new
sort of.

01:09:53.899 --> 01:09:55.441
Always lovely
to catch up with Steve Coogan.

01:09:55.442 --> 01:09:57.694
Michael BublÃ© has a new record,

01:09:57.695 --> 01:09:58.736
and it's about to come out.

01:09:58.737 --> 01:10:00.905
It's called Christmas
is a Special Time for Me,

01:10:00.906 --> 01:10:02.949
and it's a special time
for you.

01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:04.033
He's gonna sing a track
from it now...

01:10:04.034 --> 01:10:05.034
Just another.

01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:06.786
Called Holly Leaves
and Christmas Trees.

01:10:06.787 --> 01:10:08.121
Michael BublÃ©!

01:10:08.122 --> 01:10:09.455
Steve, please,
for fuck's sake,

01:10:09.456 --> 01:10:10.666
don't talk over me on.

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:13.126
Is that all right, Steve?

01:10:13.127 --> 01:10:15.170
I'm sorry I didn't get
to mention the fitness video.

01:10:16.672 --> 01:10:18.715
You know,
they're pretty tight these days

01:10:18.716 --> 01:10:20.384
with that sort of thing.

01:10:21.927 --> 01:10:23.761
Time now for some music,

01:10:23.762 --> 01:10:26.264
and we're going to listen now
to Alanis Morissette.

01:10:26.265 --> 01:10:28.307
Port master
coming up in a moment

01:10:28.308 --> 01:10:30.268
and Lynn with the travel.

01:10:30.269 --> 01:10:31.936
All that still to come.

01:10:31.937 --> 01:10:34.398
Ay!
88 and 91 FM.

01:10:36.108 --> 01:10:38.693
â™ª Walked up the stairs â™ª

01:10:38.694 --> 01:10:44.365
â™ª I opened your door
without ringing your bell â™ª

01:10:44.366 --> 01:10:45.950
Very polite.

01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:49.036
â™ª Walked down the hall â™ª

01:10:49.037 --> 01:10:51.164
â™ª Into your room â™ª

01:10:51.165 --> 01:10:52.582
What, mine?

01:10:52.583 --> 01:10:56.502
â™ª Where I could
smell you â™ª

01:10:56.503 --> 01:10:57.628
â™ª And I... â™ª

01:10:57.629 --> 01:10:58.880
Bit loud.

01:10:58.881 --> 01:11:02.091
â™ª Shouldn't be here â™ª

01:11:02.092 --> 01:11:03.301
Well, that's true enough.

01:11:03.302 --> 01:11:05.636
â™ª Without permission â™ª

01:11:05.637 --> 01:11:08.307
â™ª Shouldn't be here â™ª

01:11:09.767 --> 01:11:12.143
â™ª Would you forgive me,
love â™ª

01:11:12.144 --> 01:11:13.394
â™ª â™ª

01:11:13.395 --> 01:11:15.354
â™ª If I danced in your shower? â™ª

01:11:15.355 --> 01:11:16.773
Weird.

01:11:16.774 --> 01:11:18.566
â™ª Would you forgive me,
love â™ª

01:11:18.567 --> 01:11:19.984
â™ª â™ª

01:11:19.985 --> 01:11:22.028
Why are you

01:11:22.029 --> 01:11:24.030
round at my house
rooting through stuff?

01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:26.240
â™ª Would you forgive me,
love â™ª

01:11:26.241 --> 01:11:31.204
â™ª If I stay all afternoon? â™ª

01:11:31.205 --> 01:11:32.330
Oh.

01:11:32.331 --> 01:11:33.998
Do you basically
want to borrow my flat?

01:11:33.999 --> 01:11:36.000
Is that what you're saying?

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:37.502
Hello.
I am Lorenzo.

01:11:37.503 --> 01:11:39.086
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to Ravello.

01:11:39.087 --> 01:11:40.129
Buongiorno.

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:41.172
Hi, Mr. Coogan.

01:11:41.173 --> 01:11:42.548
We walk to Villa Cimbrone.

01:11:42.549 --> 01:11:43.591
Walk?
Walk?

01:11:43.592 --> 01:11:44.675
Yeah.

01:11:44.676 --> 01:11:46.302
How far is it?
Five minutes.

01:11:46.303 --> 01:11:48.179
Five minutes, okay.
Great.

01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:50.014
Should really have asked him
for his I.D.

01:11:50.015 --> 01:11:51.933
I mean, we're trusting him,
basically,

01:11:51.934 --> 01:11:54.769
on the strength of a polo shirt
with a logo on it.

01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:55.979
Seemed very nice, though.

01:11:57.439 --> 01:11:58.815
I think this is

01:11:58.816 --> 01:12:00.608
I think steps are better
than a slope.

01:12:00.609 --> 01:12:04.029
A slope, I think, is better
for your leg muscles.

01:12:06.448 --> 01:12:09.200
I'll try the slope.

01:12:09.201 --> 01:12:10.827
See?
It's nice, isn't it?

01:12:10.828 --> 01:12:11.869
It's smooth.

01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:13.247
It's just different.

01:12:16.959 --> 01:12:18.459
The Camelia suite.

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.753
Right, okay.

01:12:21.672 --> 01:12:23.047
Prego.

01:12:23.048 --> 01:12:26.843
Oh, wow.

01:12:26.844 --> 01:12:29.262
Uh, I'll have this one.

01:12:29.263 --> 01:12:30.721
This is a very nice room.

01:12:30.722 --> 01:12:32.598
Please have a look outside
as well.

01:12:32.599 --> 01:12:33.600
Oh, boy.

01:12:34.643 --> 01:12:35.685
Prego.

01:12:35.686 --> 01:12:37.019
This is the Greta Garbo suite.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.354
Greta Garbo?

01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:40.273
Yeah.
She also stayed here.

01:12:40.274 --> 01:12:41.524
Wow.

01:12:41.525 --> 01:12:45.528
Well,
you know what Byron said...

01:12:45.529 --> 01:12:47.864
about Don Juan.

01:12:47.865 --> 01:12:50.741
Could anyone have written it
who has not lived?

01:12:50.742 --> 01:12:52.702
Hi.
Rob?

01:12:52.703 --> 01:12:54.078
It's Donna.

01:12:54.079 --> 01:12:56.080
I've got some good news.

01:12:56.081 --> 01:12:57.456
You've got the part.

01:12:57.457 --> 01:12:59.458
Seriously?

01:12:59.459 --> 01:13:01.377
Yeah. Seriously.
They loved you.

01:13:01.378 --> 01:13:02.546
They loved your audition.

01:13:05.299 --> 01:13:07.508
Right.
Wow.

01:13:07.509 --> 01:13:09.886
They want you in L.A.
week after next

01:13:09.887 --> 01:13:11.470
for a costume fitting.

01:13:11.471 --> 01:13:13.431
And how long is the shoot?

01:13:13.432 --> 01:13:14.891
Eight weeks!

01:13:14.892 --> 01:13:15.892
Eight weeks?

01:13:15.893 --> 01:13:17.143
I know.

01:13:17.144 --> 01:13:19.103
It's great news, isn't it?

01:13:19.104 --> 01:13:21.105
God. Right.
Um...

01:13:21.106 --> 01:13:24.318
The film starts filming
in three weeks.

01:13:25.903 --> 01:13:28.321
I'm in the Greta Garbo room.

01:13:28.322 --> 01:13:29.530
Are you?
Yes.

01:13:29.531 --> 01:13:30.532
Really?
Yeah.

01:13:32.576 --> 01:13:33.910
Oh, wow.

01:13:33.911 --> 01:13:35.244
Look at that.

01:13:35.245 --> 01:13:38.331
This is called
the terrace of infinity.

01:13:38.332 --> 01:13:40.333
John Huston filmed a scene here

01:13:40.334 --> 01:13:42.543
for Beat the Devil
with Humphrey Bogart.

01:13:42.544 --> 01:13:44.128
They all stayed here:

01:13:44.129 --> 01:13:46.464
Bogart, Huston,
and Gina Lollobrigida.

01:13:46.465 --> 01:13:47.840
Wow.

01:13:47.841 --> 01:13:49.050
Gosh.

01:13:49.051 --> 01:13:50.468
Incredible.

01:13:50.469 --> 01:13:52.261
And now Rob Brydon
and Steve Coogan.

01:13:52.262 --> 01:13:53.888
Yeah, right.
Yeah, sure.

01:13:53.889 --> 01:13:55.723
Well, thank you very much.
Thank you to you.

01:13:55.724 --> 01:13:57.976
Enjoy your evening.
Thank you. Bye.

01:13:59.019 --> 01:14:00.603
Whoa, God.

01:14:00.604 --> 01:14:01.688
Wow.

01:14:03.523 --> 01:14:05.942
It'd be great to go back in time
to the 1950s.

01:14:05.943 --> 01:14:07.526
Oh, God.
1958.

01:14:07.527 --> 01:14:09.654
Go back in time
and just come up here

01:14:09.655 --> 01:14:11.489
with Gina Lollobrigida

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:14.326
and just snog her.

01:14:16.036 --> 01:14:17.704
This is as good as it gets.

01:14:23.585 --> 01:14:24.752
Ahh.

01:14:24.753 --> 01:14:27.004
It's a lovely little, uh...

01:14:27.005 --> 01:14:29.298
Ooh.
Nice?

01:14:29.299 --> 01:14:30.633
You know what that is?
Very nice.

01:14:30.634 --> 01:14:32.218
You know what it is?
Sweet.

01:14:32.219 --> 01:14:33.303
It's a kumquat.

01:14:35.681 --> 01:14:37.515
Come, come, Mr. Bond.

01:14:37.516 --> 01:14:39.684
You derive just as much pleasure
from saying...

01:14:39.685 --> 01:14:42.728
Kumquat as I do.

01:14:42.729 --> 01:14:47.066
Come, Quat,
it's time for us to go.

01:14:47.067 --> 01:14:48.818
Quat!

01:14:48.819 --> 01:14:49.986
Quat, come!

01:14:49.987 --> 01:14:52.530
Quat, come.
Come, Quat.

01:14:52.531 --> 01:14:54.407
One of the most erotic
experiences in my life

01:14:54.408 --> 01:14:56.617
was seeing a quat come
right in front of my eyes.

01:14:56.618 --> 01:14:58.661
Oh, please.
For God's sakes.

01:14:58.662 --> 01:15:00.705
God, you've not lived
till you've seen a quat come

01:15:00.706 --> 01:15:03.875
right in front of you
in a bar in Vietnam.

01:15:05.544 --> 01:15:07.420
Mmm.
My God!

01:15:07.421 --> 01:15:10.047
When that quat came
ahh.

01:15:10.048 --> 01:15:13.218
Grazie.

01:15:16.847 --> 01:15:19.098
Bogart, when he made
Beat the Devil

01:15:19.099 --> 01:15:21.017
you won't know this

01:15:21.018 --> 01:15:22.810
had an accident
during the filming.

01:15:22.811 --> 01:15:23.853
Did you know this?

01:15:23.854 --> 01:15:24.896
This is news to me.

01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:28.774
Why the hell
didn't you tell me?

01:15:28.775 --> 01:15:30.067
I came as quick as I could.

01:15:30.068 --> 01:15:31.694
Humphrey Bogart's
had an accident.

01:15:31.695 --> 01:15:33.904
No, he had a car crash,
and he knocked some teeth out.

01:15:33.905 --> 01:15:35.449
So when he was talking...

01:15:37.075 --> 01:15:38.659
Of all the bars
in all the towns...

01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:39.994
In all the world...

01:15:39.995 --> 01:15:41.203
Of all the bars
in all the towns,

01:15:41.204 --> 01:15:42.246
you had to come into mine.

01:15:42.247 --> 01:15:43.956
Kinda relaxed kinda guy.

01:15:43.957 --> 01:15:45.499
Just relaxed.
You believe he's living it.

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.251
He's saying the words.
You don't believe he's acting.

01:15:47.252 --> 01:15:49.170
I imagine his arms
are always at his side.

01:15:49.171 --> 01:15:50.171
Oh, hey.

01:15:50.172 --> 01:15:51.589
He acts as though

01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:53.340
he knows something
nobody else knows, yeah?

01:15:53.341 --> 01:15:54.425
Yeah.
Oh, yes.

01:15:54.426 --> 01:15:55.968
You know that?
Yeah. No. Yeah.

01:15:55.969 --> 01:15:58.012
That's what I do.
No, sorry. I do the opposite.

01:15:58.013 --> 01:16:00.806
I act like everybody else
knows something I don't know.

01:16:00.807 --> 01:16:02.725
Right.

01:16:02.726 --> 01:16:04.143
Mm.
That's me.

01:16:04.144 --> 01:16:05.728
Now, Humphrey Bogart.

01:16:05.729 --> 01:16:06.854
Keep talking.

01:16:06.855 --> 01:16:07.981
Yeah.
He couldn't talk.

01:16:11.902 --> 01:16:13.652
Nowadays,
you get an Oscar for that.

01:16:13.653 --> 01:16:14.737
Absolutely, yeah.

01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:15.863
Okay, but in those days, no.

01:16:15.864 --> 01:16:17.323
So what do they do?

01:16:17.324 --> 01:16:18.699
Okay, I'll tell you.
I'll tell you.

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.117
They had to dub him.

01:16:20.118 --> 01:16:21.202
Who dubbed him?

01:16:21.203 --> 01:16:22.703
Steve Coogan-two points

01:16:22.704 --> 01:16:25.998
who dubbed Humphrey Bogart
in Beat the Devil?

01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:27.083
George Raft.

01:16:27.084 --> 01:16:28.125
Bzz!
Wrong.

01:16:28.126 --> 01:16:29.502
Peter Sellers.

01:16:29.503 --> 01:16:32.379
Imagine Truman Capote
sitting here, can't you?

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:34.006
Can you do him?

01:16:34.007 --> 01:16:36.342
I could have a stab
at Philip Seymour Hoffman

01:16:36.343 --> 01:16:37.718
or Toby Jones doing it,

01:16:37.719 --> 01:16:39.303
but I couldn't really,
you know.

01:16:39.304 --> 01:16:41.013
I couldn't really
no, not really.

01:16:41.014 --> 01:16:42.890
I think you either do it well
or don't bother.

01:16:42.891 --> 01:16:44.809
Better not to try, then.
Yeah, exactly.

01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:46.644
Gore Vidal said
about Truman Capote

01:16:46.645 --> 01:16:50.439
that he turned lying
into an art form...

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.149
a minor art form.

01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:56.153
Yes, I also said of Truman

01:16:56.154 --> 01:17:01.742
that dying, for him,
was a great career move.

01:17:01.743 --> 01:17:02.953
Oh.

01:17:05.122 --> 01:17:07.206
But did he purse his lips
at the end and go like that?

01:17:07.207 --> 01:17:09.542
Ohh.

01:17:09.543 --> 01:17:11.418
Well, the thing
with Gore Vidal

01:17:11.419 --> 01:17:15.339
Gore spoke as though he had
worked out the secret of life,

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:17.091
and he also said,

01:17:17.092 --> 01:17:20.761
it is not enough
for me to succeed.

01:17:20.762 --> 01:17:23.055
My friends must fail.

01:17:23.056 --> 01:17:24.140
Mm.

01:17:24.141 --> 01:17:26.142
You know, Byron was a bit like
Gore Vidal because.

01:17:26.143 --> 01:17:27.268
How so?

01:17:27.269 --> 01:17:29.895
Because they were both
in exile in Italy.

01:17:29.896 --> 01:17:31.188
True.

01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:33.023
Self-imposed exile,
cultural exile,

01:17:33.024 --> 01:17:35.359
because they-because their

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.986
the way they thought
and lived

01:17:36.987 --> 01:17:38.988
was totally at odds
with the zeitgeist

01:17:38.989 --> 01:17:40.948
of their respective countries.

01:17:40.949 --> 01:17:41.991
You know what he said?

01:17:41.992 --> 01:17:43.409
When Byron came to Italy,
you know what he said?

01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:45.452
He said, I will not give way
to all the cant of Christendom.

01:17:45.453 --> 01:17:47.830
He said, I have been cloyed
with applause

01:17:47.831 --> 01:17:49.665
and sickened with abuse.

01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:51.333
Well,

01:17:51.334 --> 01:17:54.337
one of those must ring bells
with present company.

01:17:55.630 --> 01:17:57.381
I refer to the abuse.

01:17:57.382 --> 01:17:59.550
Yeah, I know, but I've been
cloyed with applause.

01:17:59.551 --> 01:18:00.759
So have I.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.386
Yeah, well, I've been

01:18:02.387 --> 01:18:04.221
I've been cloyed
more than I've been abused.

01:18:04.222 --> 01:18:05.848
And so have I.

01:18:05.849 --> 01:18:08.184
Well, yeah.
Well, there you go.

01:18:08.185 --> 01:18:09.603
All right,
so we're both happy.

01:18:12.230 --> 01:18:14.190
Mind you, if you got to be
exiled anywhere,

01:18:14.191 --> 01:18:15.733
I could be exiled here.

01:18:15.734 --> 01:18:18.820
I could see out my days here
quite happily.

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:22.364
Yeah, well,
you'd be able to finally,

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:25.492
you know, come out,
wouldn't you?

01:18:25.493 --> 01:18:27.161
What a relief that would be.

01:18:27.162 --> 01:18:28.996
Oh, it'd be such a weight
off your shoulders.

01:18:28.997 --> 01:18:33.042
Yeah, yeah,
finally say to people...

01:18:33.043 --> 01:18:35.669
Happily living with Steve
in our villa

01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:37.338
overlooking the coast.

01:18:37.339 --> 01:18:39.341
Finally, we can be ourselves.

01:18:44.054 --> 01:18:45.346
Can you wiggle both eyebrows?

01:18:45.347 --> 01:18:46.889
Oh, of course I can.
Elementary.

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:48.766
Go on.

01:18:48.767 --> 01:18:50.226
Yeah, you looked at me
like I couldn't do it.

01:18:50.227 --> 01:18:51.936
You looked me
'cause I can do the same.

01:18:51.937 --> 01:18:53.103
That's no great achievement.

01:18:53.104 --> 01:18:54.563
You either can or you can't.

01:18:54.564 --> 01:18:56.399
Can you wiggle your ears
independently?

01:18:57.859 --> 01:18:58.901
Let's see what you can do
first,

01:18:58.902 --> 01:19:00.569
and then I'll answer.

01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:02.154
Tonight on The South Bank Show,

01:19:02.155 --> 01:19:04.531
Steve Coogan
and his new art installation.

01:19:04.532 --> 01:19:05.658
Ears on the Move.

01:19:05.659 --> 01:19:07.744
We ask him why and how.

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.210
Hello?

01:19:16.211 --> 01:19:19.088
Buonasera.
How are you?

01:19:19.089 --> 01:19:21.090
Hi.
How's it going?

01:19:21.091 --> 01:19:22.383
It's good.

01:19:22.384 --> 01:19:23.968
We are in
such a beautiful place.

01:19:23.969 --> 01:19:25.511
We're.

01:19:25.512 --> 01:19:27.137
Lucky you.
It's horrible here.

01:19:27.138 --> 01:19:29.348
Is it'?
Oh, sorry.

01:19:29.349 --> 01:19:30.641
I've just got so much work
to do.

01:19:30.642 --> 01:19:31.850
It's chaos.

01:19:31.851 --> 01:19:33.269
Okay, well,

01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:35.854
let me lift your spirits
with a little news bulletin,

01:19:35.855 --> 01:19:37.690
courtesy of our friend Dustin.

01:19:37.691 --> 01:19:39.900
I have some terrific news
to tell you.

01:19:39.901 --> 01:19:41.652
And the news is
Rob, sorry.

01:19:41.653 --> 01:19:43.070
I'm just in the middle
of something.

01:19:43.071 --> 01:19:44.280
Can Dustin wait?

01:19:44.281 --> 01:19:45.447
I'll see you on Monday, okay?

01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:46.865
Little bit of news?

01:19:46.866 --> 01:19:48.909
Hey.
I've been trying to Skype you.

01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:50.577
Have you?
Sorry.

01:19:50.578 --> 01:19:52.955
Yeah.
What-what's going on?

01:19:52.956 --> 01:19:54.331
What are you up to?

01:19:54.332 --> 01:19:56.125
Not much.
Nothing, really.

01:19:56.126 --> 01:19:57.459
There's nothing to do.

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.253
Well, you must be doing
something.

01:19:59.254 --> 01:20:00.462
All right, love.
Bye-bye.

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:02.172
' BY6~b ye.
' BYE-bye.

01:20:02.173 --> 01:20:04.509
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

01:20:09.514 --> 01:20:13.100
Well, that's a disappointment.
That really is.

01:20:13.101 --> 01:20:16.103
I was looking forward
to telling you my news.

01:20:16.104 --> 01:20:18.063
That's terrific news.

01:20:18.064 --> 01:20:20.065
Wait till you hear this.

01:20:20.066 --> 01:20:21.483
I'm gonna be in a movie.

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:23.027
That's right.

01:20:23.028 --> 01:20:26.447
I'm gonna be
in an actual American movie.

01:20:26.448 --> 01:20:28.574
I'm going to L.A.

01:20:28.575 --> 01:20:30.326
I'm going to Hollywood.

01:20:30.327 --> 01:20:32.119
I'll be out there.

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.163
You'll be in London
with Chloe.

01:20:34.164 --> 01:20:35.623
Right.

01:20:38.084 --> 01:20:39.376
Yeah.

01:20:39.377 --> 01:20:42.129
Let me talk to Mum,
all right'?

01:20:42.130 --> 01:20:43.255
Yeah.

01:20:43.256 --> 01:20:44.590
I'll give her a call now,

01:20:44.591 --> 01:20:46.759
and then
I'll call you straight back.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.260
Okay, great.

01:20:48.261 --> 01:20:49.887
All right,
we'll figure something out.

01:20:49.888 --> 01:20:51.805
All right, love you.

01:20:51.806 --> 01:20:52.931
Love you too.

01:20:52.932 --> 01:20:55.059
Qkay. Bye

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:56.894
I got some other news too.

01:20:56.895 --> 01:20:58.896
I had a pretty exciting

01:20:58.897 --> 01:21:01.899
random sexual encounter
with a pirate.

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:04.526
Yes, I did, yeah.

01:21:04.527 --> 01:21:07.404
Oh, yeah.

01:21:07.405 --> 01:21:09.281
Turns out I'm
I'm quite something.

01:21:09.282 --> 01:21:10.367
Mm.

01:21:13.286 --> 01:21:16.206
Yeah.

01:21:17.415 --> 01:21:19.042
Eh.

01:21:25.256 --> 01:21:28.218
Baciamo le mani, Don Ciccio.

01:21:30.011 --> 01:21:31.762
Mi benedica.

01:21:31.763 --> 01:21:33.597
Benedetto.

01:21:33.598 --> 01:21:35.307
Come ti chiami?

01:21:35.308 --> 01:21:37.351
Mi chiamo Vito Corleone.

01:21:37.352 --> 01:21:38.602
Ah.

01:21:38.603 --> 01:21:41.105
E tuo padre-come si chiama?

01:21:41.106 --> 01:21:43.607
Si chiama Antonio Andolini.

01:21:43.608 --> 01:21:44.775
Piu forte.

01:21:44.776 --> 01:21:46.443
Non ti santo bane.

01:21:46.444 --> 01:21:48.821
A vvicina ti.

01:21:48.822 --> 01:21:53.326
Mio padre si chiama
Antonio Brydon.

01:21:54.327 --> 01:21:55.744
E questo 6 per ta.

01:21:55.745 --> 01:21:57.497
Ugh!

01:22:02.085 --> 01:22:04.378
E questo. E questo.

01:22:04.379 --> 01:22:07.423
E questo.
E questo 6 per ta.

01:22:07.424 --> 01:22:08.842
E questo 6 per ta.

01:22:27.068 --> 01:22:29.027
Hi.
Hi.

01:22:29.028 --> 01:22:31.572
Sorry. Did I wake you up?
No, no.

01:22:31.573 --> 01:22:33.449
Joe, uh,
has said he wants to come out

01:22:33.450 --> 01:22:35.033
and, you know,
hang out with us.

01:22:35.034 --> 01:22:36.034
Excellent.

01:22:36.035 --> 01:22:37.035
It means
that Emma's got to fly

01:22:37.036 --> 01:22:38.454
to pick him up in Ibiza,

01:22:38.455 --> 01:22:40.080
and I've got to meet them both
in Naples.

01:22:40.081 --> 01:22:41.290
Right.
Ls that okay?

01:22:41.291 --> 01:22:42.583
Yeah, absolutely.

01:22:42.584 --> 01:22:44.461
'Cause it means
missing Sicily.

01:22:46.129 --> 01:22:47.754
It's your boy.
That's more important.

01:22:47.755 --> 01:22:48.839
Okay, thank you.
Great.

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:49.923
Good?
All right, yeah.

01:22:49.924 --> 01:22:51.091
All right.

01:22:51.092 --> 01:22:52.259
Good.
See you at breakfast.

01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:53.678
Breakfast.

01:22:58.266 --> 01:22:59.349
Grazie.

01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:01.352
Oh.
I am starving.

01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:05.315
Aah.

01:23:06.566 --> 01:23:08.817
Look at this, eh?

01:23:08.818 --> 01:23:09.902
Oh, yes.

01:23:09.903 --> 01:23:10.903
Oh, yes.
This is good.

01:23:10.904 --> 01:23:11.945
Mmm!
That's good eggs.

01:23:11.946 --> 01:23:12.988
Yeah, yeah.

01:23:12.989 --> 01:23:14.615
You can taste a good egg,
can't you?

01:23:14.616 --> 01:23:15.782
Yeah.

01:23:15.783 --> 01:23:18.327
What I've discovered
on this trip

01:23:18.328 --> 01:23:20.746
is that
I can live very simply.

01:23:20.747 --> 01:23:22.289
I mean, I'm very happy
right now...

01:23:22.290 --> 01:23:23.332
Yes.

01:23:23.333 --> 01:23:26.418
With a simple breakfast,

01:23:26.419 --> 01:23:28.670
a simple view,
nothing fancy.

01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:31.423
And that's just wonderful.

01:23:31.424 --> 01:23:33.550
I don't think you can top it,
really, with anything.

01:23:33.551 --> 01:23:34.718
Could put some brown sauce
on it.

01:23:34.719 --> 01:23:36.011
That's true.

01:23:36.012 --> 01:23:39.515
Emma's organized a place
for us to stay on Capri.

01:23:39.516 --> 01:23:40.891
So I was gonna ask you,

01:23:40.892 --> 01:23:42.351
if you want,
you can come and stay...

01:23:42.352 --> 01:23:43.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:43.561 --> 01:23:45.270
Because
then you still have

01:23:45.271 --> 01:23:46.689
your six places to write about.

01:23:47.732 --> 01:23:48.774
Great.

01:23:48.775 --> 01:23:50.609
Be a shame not to go to Sicily,
though.

01:23:50.610 --> 01:23:53.237
I was looking forward to that
for obvious reasons.

01:23:53.238 --> 01:23:54.947
Well, you don't have to

01:23:54.948 --> 01:23:56.573
you don't have to be in Sicily
to do impressions.

01:23:56.574 --> 01:23:58.450
See the
coffee commercial he did?

01:23:58.451 --> 01:23:59.868
No.

01:23:59.869 --> 01:24:01.078
Pacino-he sits there,
and he says,

01:24:01.079 --> 01:24:03.372
You know, for me,
coffee is a way of life.

01:24:03.373 --> 01:24:06.375
A Pacino script will always
have coffee marks on it.

01:24:06.376 --> 01:24:08.377
That's how you know
it's a Pacino script.

01:24:08.378 --> 01:24:09.836
And then he takes a sip
and goes.

01:24:09.837 --> 01:24:11.547
'That's good coffee.

01:24:11.548 --> 01:24:13.966
And you go,
'That's Al Pacino?

01:24:13.967 --> 01:24:15.676
And that's another reason
why I think,

01:24:15.677 --> 01:24:17.553
well, so I did Crunchy Nut
Cornflakes, you know?

01:24:17.554 --> 01:24:18.971
But he did coffee.

01:24:18.972 --> 01:24:21.265
There's a lot of similarities.
Yeah.

01:24:21.266 --> 01:24:23.976
Two short, brooding,
intense actors,

01:24:23.977 --> 01:24:26.688
promoting products
they genuinely love.

01:24:34.988 --> 01:24:36.446
Hello?

01:24:36.447 --> 01:24:38.115
Hello. You all right?
Yeah, great.

01:24:38.116 --> 01:24:39.575
I've got Joe,
and we're just about

01:24:39.576 --> 01:24:40.993
to get on a plane to Naples.

01:24:40.994 --> 01:24:42.244
Okay.
How is he?

01:24:42.245 --> 01:24:43.287
Good.
He's great.

01:24:43.288 --> 01:24:45.247
We're gonna get a cab
from the airport,

01:24:45.248 --> 01:24:47.749
and we'll go to
the Fontanelle catacombs, okay?

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:49.751
Why are we meeting
at a cemetery?

01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:51.169
Well,
it's on the edge of town,

01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:53.463
so it'll be easy, 'cause Naples
is crazy for the traffic,

01:24:53.464 --> 01:24:54.923
and I've always
wanted to see it.

01:24:54.924 --> 01:24:56.466
It's in
one of my favorite films.

01:24:56.467 --> 01:24:58.051
All right, listen,
tell Joe I love him

01:24:58.052 --> 01:24:59.970
and we're gonna have
a great time.

01:24:59.971 --> 01:25:01.888
All right, brilliant.
I'll pass it on. See you soon.

01:25:01.889 --> 01:25:02.973
Thanks, love.
Okay, bye.

01:25:02.974 --> 01:25:04.182
Right.
Let's see.

01:25:04.183 --> 01:25:05.559
Let me see.
Where are we?

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:06.852
Okay, I know. I've got it.
I've got it.

01:25:06.853 --> 01:25:10.188
Don't you
you just concentrate on driving.

01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:13.025
Paul McCartney,
The Long and VWnding Road,

01:25:13.026 --> 01:25:17.405
and he may well have been
talking about the Amalfi Coast.

01:25:18.656 --> 01:25:20.699
Right. Very close.
Very close.

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.327
We can almost touch it.

01:25:24.203 --> 01:25:25.746
Right.
Have a look at that now.

01:25:25.747 --> 01:25:27.664
Tell me-is that where
we're meant to be?

01:25:27.665 --> 01:25:29.124
Um...

01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:31.001
That should be working
with us, not against us.

01:25:31.002 --> 01:25:32.420
I'm trying
to make it go bigger.

01:25:43.848 --> 01:25:46.058
It's a bit like
being at one of your shows.

01:25:46.059 --> 01:25:48.477
Ah, a lot of people.

01:25:48.478 --> 01:25:49.645
It's full.

01:25:49.646 --> 01:25:52.065
I'll give you that.

01:25:53.733 --> 01:25:55.192
Weird, isn't it,

01:25:55.193 --> 01:25:58.362
that Byron used to drink
out of a skull?

01:25:58.363 --> 01:26:00.197
Ohh...

01:26:00.198 --> 01:26:01.406
You all right?

01:26:01.407 --> 01:26:03.659
Alas, poor Yorick.

01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:05.369
I knew him well.

01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:06.370
That's a total misquote.

01:26:06.371 --> 01:26:07.871
It's, Alas, poor Yorick.
I knew him, Horatio.

01:26:07.872 --> 01:26:09.539
Alas, poor Yorick.
I knew him well.

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:11.541
It's not, I knew him well.
It's, I knew him, Horatio.

01:26:11.542 --> 01:26:13.377
It's the most famous misquote
in the English language,

01:26:13.378 --> 01:26:14.419
and you just did it.

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:15.879
What's the actual quote?
I'm a bit shocked.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.255
All right,
what's the actual quote, then?

01:26:17.256 --> 01:26:18.674
Alas, poor Yer-ala
Alas, poor.

01:26:18.675 --> 01:26:20.008
See, you don't know it
yourself.

01:26:20.009 --> 01:26:21.093
I do know it.

01:26:21.094 --> 01:26:22.552
Alas, poor Yorick.
Alas.

01:26:22.553 --> 01:26:24.137
Alas, poor Yorick.

01:26:24.138 --> 01:26:26.264
Well, who are you talking to,
me or the invisible man?

01:26:26.265 --> 01:26:28.433
I'll tell you.
I'm talking to him about you.

01:26:28.434 --> 01:26:29.851
Who am I?
You're Yorick.

01:26:29.852 --> 01:26:31.436
Alas, poor Yorick.

01:26:31.437 --> 01:26:35.273
I knew him, Horatio,
a man of infinite jest...

01:26:35.274 --> 01:26:36.441
Thank you.

01:26:36.442 --> 01:26:38.110
Of excellent fancy.

01:26:38.111 --> 01:26:39.695
Thank you.

01:26:39.696 --> 01:26:41.697
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times.

01:26:41.698 --> 01:26:44.199
That is true.

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:47.911
Where be your gibes now,
your gambols,

01:26:47.912 --> 01:26:50.664
your songs,
your flights of merriment

01:26:50.665 --> 01:26:53.126
wont to set a table on a roar?

01:26:56.129 --> 01:26:57.338
Puff.

01:27:01.801 --> 01:27:04.136
Feel lucky, punk?

01:27:04.137 --> 01:27:05.721
He didn't say that.

01:27:05.722 --> 01:27:08.306
I deliberately got it wrong
to reel you in.

01:27:08.307 --> 01:27:10.475
All right, go on.
What's the real quote?

01:27:10.476 --> 01:27:12.561
I know what you're thinking,
punk.

01:27:12.562 --> 01:27:15.564
You're thinking,
Did he fire six shots

01:27:15.565 --> 01:27:17.357
or only five?

01:27:17.358 --> 01:27:18.567
Tell you the truth,

01:27:18.568 --> 01:27:20.360
I can't quite remember myself

01:27:20.361 --> 01:27:22.237
in all this excitement.

01:27:22.238 --> 01:27:24.072
It's a myth
that he whispers all the time.

01:27:24.073 --> 01:27:26.074
Sometimes
he just speaks normally,

01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:27.868
but his jaw is clenched.

01:27:27.869 --> 01:27:30.871
If I wanted a lesson
in how Clint Eastwood spoke,

01:27:30.872 --> 01:27:32.081
I'd talk to Clint Eastwood.

01:27:33.082 --> 01:27:34.833
Oh, shit.

01:27:34.834 --> 01:27:36.251
Hello?

01:27:36.252 --> 01:27:37.753
Hey.
Hey, we're here.

01:27:37.754 --> 01:27:39.254
Are you?
Oh, great.

01:27:39.255 --> 01:27:40.672
We're just at the entrance.

01:27:40.673 --> 01:27:42.382
Right.
See you in a bit.

01:27:42.383 --> 01:27:43.383
Is she here?

01:27:43.384 --> 01:27:44.426
Yeah.

01:27:44.427 --> 01:27:45.427
Have they arrived?

01:27:45.428 --> 01:27:46.637
Yeah.

01:27:53.978 --> 01:27:55.020
Come here, lad.

01:27:55.021 --> 01:27:56.188
Hey!

01:27:56.189 --> 01:27:57.397
Nice to see you.
You too.

01:27:57.398 --> 01:27:58.899
It's good to see you, buddy.

01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:00.358
There he is, big boy.

01:28:00.359 --> 01:28:02.360
Yeah.
Hello. All right?

01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:03.570
Almost as tall as you...

01:28:03.571 --> 01:28:05.572
I'll have to start
wearing me high heels soon.

01:28:05.573 --> 01:28:07.115
So listen, I've arranged
for the mini people

01:28:07.116 --> 01:28:08.575
to come and collect the car
from here,

01:28:08.576 --> 01:28:10.202
and then we can take the taxi
to the port.

01:28:10.203 --> 01:28:11.495
It'll be about ten minutes.

01:28:11.496 --> 01:28:12.829
I, in the meantime,

01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:14.206
am gonna have
a quick look around.

01:28:14.207 --> 01:28:16.082
I'll come with you.
Good.

01:28:16.083 --> 01:28:17.834
Hey, mate, it's just really
great to see you, honestly.

01:28:17.835 --> 01:28:18.919
Yeah.
How are you?

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.378
I'm good, yeah.

01:28:20.379 --> 01:28:21.838
How's Mamie?
Oh, she's good, yeah.

01:28:21.839 --> 01:28:23.006
Enjoying it
a lot more than I was.

01:28:23.007 --> 01:28:24.007
Yeah.

01:28:24.008 --> 01:28:25.467
Why are we here?

01:28:25.468 --> 01:28:27.260
Ingrid Bergman.

01:28:27.261 --> 01:28:28.637
Which one is she?

01:28:28.638 --> 01:28:30.806
She's not here.

01:28:30.807 --> 01:28:33.266
But she was in
Journey to Italy.

01:28:33.267 --> 01:28:34.768
Well, how do you feel
about your exams?

01:28:34.769 --> 01:28:36.478
Oh, you know,
I hope they went fine.

01:28:36.479 --> 01:28:38.104
I'm just trying
not to worry about them.

01:28:38.105 --> 01:28:39.189
Just gonna relax.

01:28:39.190 --> 01:28:41.483
I'm sure they're fine.
I'm sure they're fine.

01:28:41.484 --> 01:28:43.026
You worked a damn sight harder
than I ever did.

01:28:43.027 --> 01:28:44.778
First her husband goes off
to Capri

01:28:44.779 --> 01:28:46.279
to try and have an affair,

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:48.573
and her friend brings her here.

01:28:48.574 --> 01:28:51.076
Her friends come here
to try and pray for a baby.

01:28:51.077 --> 01:28:52.452
Ugh.

01:28:52.453 --> 01:28:54.454
Let's get out of here.

01:28:54.455 --> 01:28:56.665
It's, uh-it's a bit
of a downer, to be honest.

01:28:56.666 --> 01:28:58.125
I'm not quite sure why, but...

01:28:59.335 --> 01:29:00.962
Antonello?
Si.

01:29:02.129 --> 01:29:03.171
How are you?
Thank you.

01:29:03.172 --> 01:29:04.464
Hello, hello.
Thank you.

01:29:04.465 --> 01:29:06.091
Joe, do you want to go
and put your bag

01:29:06.092 --> 01:29:07.300
in the back of that taxi?

01:29:07.301 --> 01:29:08.760
Sure, yeah.

01:29:08.761 --> 01:29:09.970
All right, love.
Thank you.

01:29:09.971 --> 01:29:11.429
That's a nice hat.

01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:13.348
Borsalino.
Al Capone used to wear these.

01:29:13.349 --> 01:29:14.767
Thanks very much.

01:29:25.278 --> 01:29:26.444
You all right, Joe?

01:29:26.445 --> 01:29:27.571
Yeah, pretty good.

01:29:27.572 --> 01:29:29.573
See that double bass case?

01:29:29.574 --> 01:29:31.908
Yeah.
Carbon fiber.

01:29:31.909 --> 01:29:34.911
It's the strongest man-made
material in the world.

01:29:34.912 --> 01:29:36.496
Could stop a bullet, that.
It does.

01:29:36.497 --> 01:29:38.207
They use it
in bulletproof vests.

01:29:41.043 --> 01:29:42.460
I still get like a

01:29:42.461 --> 01:29:46.423
sort of a frisson of excitement
crossing water.

01:29:46.424 --> 01:29:48.341
Vedi a Napoli e muori.

01:29:48.342 --> 01:29:49.384
What does that mean?

01:29:49.385 --> 01:29:51.011
See Naples and die,

01:29:51.012 --> 01:29:52.053
in Italian.

01:29:52.054 --> 01:29:53.138
Ciao.

01:29:53.139 --> 01:29:54.139
Right, look, look, look.

01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:56.308
The birds are following us.
Look. Look. Look.

01:29:56.309 --> 01:29:57.934
Look at that one there!
Look! He's following us!

01:29:57.935 --> 01:29:59.394
Quite scary.
Like The Birds.

01:29:59.395 --> 01:30:00.979
It is.
You could be Tippi Hedren.

01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:02.147
Aah!

01:30:02.148 --> 01:30:03.732
I'll be, uh, Alfred Hitchcock

01:30:03.733 --> 01:30:04.816
just telling you what to do.

01:30:04.817 --> 01:30:06.693
He really let her get pecked.

01:30:06.694 --> 01:30:08.069
He let the birds
peck Tippi Hedren?

01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:09.112
Yeah, I think so.

01:30:09.113 --> 01:30:11.197
He also named
all the individual birds.

01:30:11.198 --> 01:30:12.240
Yeah, well.

01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:14.451
And when-they'd be having
a go at Tippi Hedren,

01:30:14.452 --> 01:30:15.577
and he would instruct them.

01:30:15.578 --> 01:30:16.703
So he'd go up to one.

01:30:16.704 --> 01:30:18.372
He'd say, Gregory, peck.

01:30:20.583 --> 01:30:21.875
Come on.
Let's go and wander.

01:30:21.876 --> 01:30:22.919
Okay.

01:30:33.429 --> 01:30:34.846
Yeah, no, what happened

01:30:34.847 --> 01:30:36.932
was that all the ash
buried everyone.

01:30:36.933 --> 01:30:38.058
Is it still active?

01:30:38.059 --> 01:30:39.560
Um, I like to think so.

01:30:41.145 --> 01:30:44.064
You got sun, sea, sangria,

01:30:44.065 --> 01:30:46.359
and, uh, La Dolce Vita
over there.

01:31:10.007 --> 01:31:11.758
Maybe wander round this way?

01:31:11.759 --> 01:31:13.176
Watch out.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:31:13.177 --> 01:31:14.261
Watch out.
Don't die.

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.724
Look, it's the house
from Le Mepris!

01:31:19.725 --> 01:31:21.351
What's that?

01:31:21.352 --> 01:31:23.603
Oh, with Brigitte Bardot.
It's incredible.

01:31:23.604 --> 01:31:25.855
They're making a film, and she's
married to the scriptwriter.

01:31:25.856 --> 01:31:27.065
It all starts to go wrong,

01:31:27.066 --> 01:31:28.984
and there's that incredible
piece of music.

01:31:28.985 --> 01:31:30.443
They keep playing it
all the way through.

01:31:30.444 --> 01:31:32.654
It's really romantic,
but it kind of gets annoying,

01:31:32.655 --> 01:31:35.281
sort of
again and again and again.

01:31:35.282 --> 01:31:37.367
Is that the one
where she's naked on the bed?

01:31:37.368 --> 01:31:38.451
Yes, that's the one.

01:31:38.452 --> 01:31:40.161
What happens at the end?

01:31:40.162 --> 01:31:41.705
She gets together
with the producer

01:31:41.706 --> 01:31:43.081
and then dies in a car crash.

01:31:43.082 --> 01:31:44.708
I like the sound of that.

01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:46.751
Really sexy
with no happy ending,

01:31:46.752 --> 01:31:48.838
like the opposite of a massage,
you know.

01:31:50.256 --> 01:31:58.256
â™ª â™ª

01:32:22.121 --> 01:32:23.329
You have the...
Local?

01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:24.789
The local wine.
Si.

01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:26.666
That's a del Furore.
Furore?

01:32:26.667 --> 01:32:28.126
Yeah.
It's from our region.

01:32:28.127 --> 01:32:29.169
Buono.

01:32:29.170 --> 01:32:30.671
Furore.

01:32:37.428 --> 01:32:38.511
Ah!

01:32:38.512 --> 01:32:40.638
Here you have
the scalloped fish.

01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:42.974
Ooh, lovely.
And the seafood salad.

01:32:42.975 --> 01:32:45.101
The bonito fish, raw.

01:32:45.102 --> 01:32:46.186
Raw, okay.
It's not for you.

01:32:46.187 --> 01:32:47.395
Not for me.

01:32:47.396 --> 01:32:49.272
Octopus to the grill.
Grazie.

01:32:49.273 --> 01:32:52.275
There's another octopus
to the grill.

01:32:52.276 --> 01:32:53.276
Grazie.

01:32:53.277 --> 01:32:54.277
Bonito fish.

01:32:54.278 --> 01:32:55.278
Grazie mille.

01:32:55.279 --> 01:32:56.362
Oh, grazie mille.

01:32:56.363 --> 01:32:58.114
Do you want some of this?

01:32:58.115 --> 01:33:00.909
Oh, yeah, sure.
'Cause you'll like this.

01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:02.494
The calamari
is absolutely gorgeous.

01:33:02.495 --> 01:33:04.120
Try it.
Perfect.

01:33:04.121 --> 01:33:05.831
Mmm.
Think I'll have some of this.

01:33:08.292 --> 01:33:09.751
Lovely Furore.

01:33:09.752 --> 01:33:11.503
Furorethat's a
Furore.

01:33:11.504 --> 01:33:13.255
That's an angry
Italian sports car.

01:33:14.256 --> 01:33:15.715
I might have a glass of Furore

01:33:15.716 --> 01:33:18.260
or perhaps a carafe
of kerfuffle.

01:33:23.974 --> 01:33:25.391
Well, I like to
think of myself as a fine wine

01:33:25.392 --> 01:33:27.685
maturing
with each passing year.

01:33:27.686 --> 01:33:30.146
Sitting in the dark,
getting fusty.

01:33:30.147 --> 01:33:32.524
If he sits there too long,
a little heavy.

01:33:32.525 --> 01:33:34.067
He does get a little heavy.
A little heavy.

01:33:34.068 --> 01:33:35.485
Well, it's a very,
very fine wine.

01:33:35.486 --> 01:33:36.778
Can get bitter.

01:33:36.779 --> 01:33:39.364
A little bit bitter,
a bit vinegary, a bit cynical.

01:33:39.365 --> 01:33:41.324
He's not as cynical
as he makes out, you know.

01:33:41.325 --> 01:33:43.326
Remember we were watching
Mamma Mia!

01:33:43.327 --> 01:33:45.161
And you know,
you're watching it with Mamie,

01:33:45.162 --> 01:33:46.704
and then at the end,
when Beryl Streep

01:33:46.705 --> 01:33:47.956
gets together
with Pierce Brosnan,

01:33:47.957 --> 01:33:49.124
you started crying.

01:33:49.125 --> 01:33:50.458
Yeah, yeah.
What?

01:33:50.459 --> 01:33:52.127
Cried at Mamma Mia!
Yeah.

01:33:52.128 --> 01:33:54.045
You cried at that bit
with Beryl Streep?

01:33:54.046 --> 01:33:56.214
I mean, I loved Mamma Mial,
but I didn't cry.

01:33:56.215 --> 01:33:57.298
I love old Pierce Bro

01:33:57.299 --> 01:33:58.675
I can't do Pierce Brosnan.

01:33:58.676 --> 01:33:59.926
I'll be very honest with you,
Joe.

01:33:59.927 --> 01:34:01.261
I can't do him.
I can't do him very well.

01:34:01.262 --> 01:34:04.889
When I do him, I sound like
a very effeminate Bono, so I do.

01:34:04.890 --> 01:34:05.890
Top 0' the mornin' to ya.

01:34:05.891 --> 01:34:07.225
The name's Bond.

01:34:07.226 --> 01:34:08.810
Top 0' the mornin' to ya,
Blofeld.

01:34:08.811 --> 01:34:10.895
I'm O'OO7.

01:34:10.896 --> 01:34:12.313
I'm James Bond, 0'OO7.

01:34:12.314 --> 01:34:14.023
What he's meaning to say is,

01:34:14.024 --> 01:34:15.400
The name's Bond, James Bond,

01:34:15.401 --> 01:34:17.360
007, license to kill.

01:34:17.361 --> 01:34:19.821
You need a slight huskiness,
and it's slightly mid-Atlantic,

01:34:19.822 --> 01:34:21.447
but it's very
sort of subtle like that.

01:34:21.448 --> 01:34:22.949
Am I getting it now?

01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:24.284
That's Northern Ireland.

01:34:24.285 --> 01:34:25.285
Rob, no!

01:34:25.286 --> 01:34:26.744
Well, he's a secret agent.

01:34:26.745 --> 01:34:28.163
He's got to be able
to go other places

01:34:28.164 --> 01:34:29.998
and lay low,
hasn't he, now?

01:34:29.999 --> 01:34:34.294
Interestingly,
up until Daniel Craig,

01:34:34.295 --> 01:34:38.215
there was only one
English James Bond.

01:34:39.925 --> 01:34:41.050
Sean Connery
Yeah.

01:34:41.051 --> 01:34:43.136
Connery.
Scottish.

01:34:43.137 --> 01:34:44.846
A milkman by trade

01:34:44.847 --> 01:34:46.181
and a part-time actor,

01:34:46.182 --> 01:34:48.391
he took the role
and made it his own.

01:34:48.392 --> 01:34:49.475
He went for the audition

01:34:49.476 --> 01:34:50.977
I don't know if you know this

01:34:50.978 --> 01:34:53.188
and Cubby Broccoli
and Saltzman auditioned him.

01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:54.314
They thought he was good.

01:34:54.315 --> 01:34:55.398
He left the room.

01:34:55.399 --> 01:34:56.941
As he walked away in the street,

01:34:56.942 --> 01:34:59.194
they said he walked
like a panther.

01:34:59.195 --> 01:35:01.112
Now, in reality,
that would be impractical.

01:35:01.113 --> 01:35:02.697
He'd be on all fours.

01:35:02.698 --> 01:35:05.033
He'd be soiling the furniture.

01:35:05.034 --> 01:35:06.618
George Lazenby.
Australian.

01:35:06.619 --> 01:35:08.286
Australian.

01:35:08.287 --> 01:35:09.579
Come on.
I know where this is going.

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:10.955
Roger Moore,
of course, English.

01:35:10.956 --> 01:35:11.956
And, um...

01:35:11.957 --> 01:35:13.208
Dalton.
Where was he from?

01:35:13.209 --> 01:35:14.417
Welsh!

01:35:14.418 --> 01:35:15.835
No.
Oh, yes.

01:35:15.836 --> 01:35:17.879
Now Rob's gonna go-go on.
Do your Timothy Dalton.

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:19.505
I'm not gonna do
what you think I'm going to do.

01:35:19.506 --> 01:35:20.548
I thought
you were gonna go...

01:35:20.549 --> 01:35:22.217
My name's Bond, James Bond.

01:35:22.218 --> 01:35:24.177
No, I'm not gonna do that.
License to kill.

01:35:24.178 --> 01:35:25.970
No, he's got a northern-y
you do him well.

01:35:25.971 --> 01:35:27.639
He's got a northern sound.

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:30.058
Things could have turned out
very nasty.

01:35:30.059 --> 01:35:32.352
That's almost
a very butch Alan Bennett.

01:35:32.353 --> 01:35:35.147
Things could have turned out
very nasty.

01:35:39.068 --> 01:35:40.193
Who's your best Bond?

01:35:40.194 --> 01:35:41.361
Daniel Craig.

01:35:41.362 --> 01:35:42.445
Ah!
Definitely.

01:35:42.446 --> 01:35:43.863
Our generation.
Exactly.

01:35:43.864 --> 01:35:45.865
You and me.
Yeah.

01:35:45.866 --> 01:35:48.826
Go on, let's hear
that Roger Moore again.

01:35:48.827 --> 01:35:50.036
What was that?
The Roger Moore again.

01:35:50.037 --> 01:35:51.079
Oh, you would like
to hear it again?

01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.121
Yeah.
Course you would.

01:35:52.122 --> 01:35:53.289
It must be nice
for you to hear.

01:35:53.290 --> 01:35:54.374
He's so well brought up,
isn't he?

01:35:54.375 --> 01:35:56.000
It must be lovely for you,
Joe,

01:35:56.001 --> 01:35:58.753
to hear an impression
properly done, yeah?

01:35:58.754 --> 01:36:03.967
And when I say properly done,
I mean done properly.

01:36:03.968 --> 01:36:05.843
Right. Ready?
Here he goes.

01:36:05.844 --> 01:36:09.389
Uh, my name is Roger Moore.

01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:12.767
Now, I'm a lot older
than I used to be,

01:36:12.768 --> 01:36:14.227
so there's a degree

01:36:14.228 --> 01:36:15.895
I'm still doing it, Steve.

01:36:15.896 --> 01:36:18.314
Please don't interrupt
in front of your son.

01:36:18.315 --> 01:36:19.691
Do him when he shouts.

01:36:19.692 --> 01:36:20.692
Do him shouting.

01:36:20.693 --> 01:36:22.777
We are in a nice place.

01:36:22.778 --> 01:36:24.404
You there, come back.

01:36:24.405 --> 01:36:25.405
No.

01:36:25.406 --> 01:36:26.614
Move!

01:36:26.615 --> 01:36:28.074
It squeaks slightly.

01:36:28.075 --> 01:36:29.492
Move!
Move!

01:36:29.493 --> 01:36:30.535
Move!
Move!

01:36:30.536 --> 01:36:31.619
Move!

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:32.453
They sound like a cow
when they're doing that.

01:36:32.454 --> 01:36:33.913
The name's Bond.
Move!

01:36:33.914 --> 01:36:35.123
Move!
Hold on.

01:36:35.124 --> 01:36:38.084
I want both of you,
one eyebrow-one eyebrow up.

01:36:38.085 --> 01:36:39.752
Oh, good, good.

01:36:39.753 --> 01:36:41.045
Of course.
That's entry level.

01:36:41.046 --> 01:36:42.672
Ah, very good.

01:36:42.673 --> 01:36:44.507
I can do that eyebrow,
or I can do that eyebrow.

01:36:44.508 --> 01:36:45.800
Oh, that is really impressive.

01:36:45.801 --> 01:36:47.218
I can do them

01:36:47.219 --> 01:36:50.806
with very little effort
at exactly the right time.

01:36:55.811 --> 01:36:57.729
It's a linguine
with shrimps and zucchini.

01:36:57.730 --> 01:36:59.272
Great cooking, huh?

01:36:59.273 --> 01:37:00.481
Great.
Look at that.

01:37:00.482 --> 01:37:02.525
And here you have
the paccheri with anchovies.

01:37:02.526 --> 01:37:04.402
Oh, that's lovely, that.
Yeah.

01:37:04.403 --> 01:37:06.279
For you, that's the linguine,

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:08.865
same with the shrimps
and the raw egg cooking.

01:37:08.866 --> 01:37:09.866
For you...
Yes?

01:37:09.867 --> 01:37:10.908
That's the best plate.

01:37:10.909 --> 01:37:12.160
Best one?
Wow!

01:37:12.161 --> 01:37:13.787
Look at that!

01:37:15.289 --> 01:37:16.664
Mmm.
Ooh.

01:37:16.665 --> 01:37:18.082
How is it'?
Fantastic. Beautiful.

01:37:18.083 --> 01:37:19.500
Oh, yeah.

01:37:19.501 --> 01:37:21.461
I have an announcement
to make.

01:37:21.462 --> 01:37:23.087
Oh?
' Really?

01:37:23.088 --> 01:37:24.922
You're pregnant.
No.

01:37:24.923 --> 01:37:26.549
I got a part in a film.

01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:27.800
Well done.
That's great news.

01:37:27.801 --> 01:37:28.926
American film.

01:37:28.927 --> 01:37:30.511
Great, wow.
Good for you.

01:37:30.512 --> 01:37:31.387
The Michael Mann one?

01:37:31.388 --> 01:37:32.430
Yeah.

01:37:32.431 --> 01:37:33.514
A Michael Mann film?

01:37:33.515 --> 01:37:34.557
Yeah.

01:37:34.558 --> 01:37:37.143
Rob, that is amazing.
Wow!

01:37:37.144 --> 01:37:38.186
Want to do another one?

01:37:38.187 --> 01:37:39.729
Oh. Thanks.

01:37:39.730 --> 01:37:41.230
Gosh, that's incredible.

01:37:41.231 --> 01:37:43.024
I know,
and it's one of the leads.

01:37:43.025 --> 01:37:44.734
It's not the lead.
It's one of the leads.

01:37:44.735 --> 01:37:45.818
It's a supporting

01:37:45.819 --> 01:37:48.196
I play a mafia accountant.

01:37:48.197 --> 01:37:49.280
I can really see it.

01:37:49.281 --> 01:37:50.740
That's amazing.
I can see it.

01:37:50.741 --> 01:37:53.826
Gangster accountant?
Tough guy with a pen.

01:37:53.827 --> 01:37:55.913
I can't make
these numbers add up.

01:37:57.039 --> 01:37:58.873
I just can't do it.

01:37:58.874 --> 01:38:00.416
You didn't do that, did you,
in the.

01:38:00.417 --> 01:38:02.043
Wasn't far off.

01:38:02.044 --> 01:38:03.419
That's not what you had to do
for your.

01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:05.213
No.
That's not what he did

01:38:05.214 --> 01:38:07.048
I kissed a waitress
in the audition.

01:38:07.049 --> 01:38:08.466
Remember that?

01:38:08.467 --> 01:38:09.550
Did you?
Yes, I do.

01:38:09.551 --> 01:38:11.469
It was a peck.

01:38:11.470 --> 01:38:13.596
His eyes.
He wasn't happy.

01:38:13.597 --> 01:38:14.972
So how long
you gonna be away for?

01:38:14.973 --> 01:38:16.099
Eight weeks.

01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:17.183
Eight weeks?
Gosh.

01:38:17.184 --> 01:38:18.518
That's tough.

01:38:18.519 --> 01:38:20.728
That's a long time to be away,
though, isn't it'?

01:38:20.729 --> 01:38:22.105
What am I gonna do otherwise?

01:38:22.106 --> 01:38:24.357
I'd just do more panel shows.

01:38:24.358 --> 01:38:26.359
Joe's, uh,
just finished his GCSEs,

01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:28.528
doing his A-levels now.

01:38:28.529 --> 01:38:29.570
A-levels, gosh.

01:38:29.571 --> 01:38:30.696
What A-levels you gonna do?

01:38:30.697 --> 01:38:32.698
Oh,
I'm going a bit science-y

01:38:32.699 --> 01:38:34.409
maths, further maths,

01:38:34.410 --> 01:38:37.286
physics, chemistry,
and electronics.

01:38:37.287 --> 01:38:38.413
Seriously?
Yeah.

01:38:38.414 --> 01:38:39.414
Bloody hell.

01:38:39.415 --> 01:38:40.540
Well, you see,
it runs in the family.

01:38:40.541 --> 01:38:41.666
My dad's an engineer, scientist.

01:38:41.667 --> 01:38:43.042
Yeah.
Granddad.

01:38:43.043 --> 01:38:45.461
What about
skipping a generation?

01:38:45.462 --> 01:38:47.380
Car swerved out of its lane,

01:38:47.381 --> 01:38:49.549
almost went into a field,
and then came back in the road.

01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:50.925
Listen,
I know a damn sight more

01:38:50.926 --> 01:38:52.176
about engineering
than you do.

01:38:52.177 --> 01:38:53.595
Yeah, but I know nothing.

01:38:58.100 --> 01:38:59.600
I think I'm gonna go
for a walk.

01:38:59.601 --> 01:39:00.643
Yeah?
Ls that okay?

01:39:00.644 --> 01:39:01.727
Yeah, of course.

01:39:01.728 --> 01:39:03.146
Say hello to those girls
over there.

01:39:03.147 --> 01:39:05.022
No, no, no, no.
They've been looking over.

01:39:05.023 --> 01:39:06.149
Definitely not.

01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:08.067
Leave him alone!

01:39:08.068 --> 01:39:09.653
Plenty of time for all that.

01:39:14.199 --> 01:39:15.908
Oh.

01:39:15.909 --> 01:39:17.160
He's so grown up, isn't he?
What a nice boy.

01:39:17.161 --> 01:39:18.536
Yes, nothing like me.

01:39:18.537 --> 01:39:19.745
Credit to you, so he is.

01:39:19.746 --> 01:39:21.080
Well, he's taller than me.

01:39:21.081 --> 01:39:22.457
Of course, you've both got that
to look forward to.

01:39:22.458 --> 01:39:23.958
Oh, yeah.
Won't be long for me.

01:39:23.959 --> 01:39:25.043
Chloe's nearly four.

01:39:28.589 --> 01:39:30.882
I'm gonna have a look
for Joe.

01:39:30.883 --> 01:39:32.425
Yeah.
Rescue.

01:39:32.426 --> 01:39:34.177
Get my priorities right.

01:39:34.178 --> 01:39:36.346
Exactly.

01:39:37.473 --> 01:39:38.682
See you in a bit.

01:39:45.731 --> 01:39:48.566
I'm gonna have to have
a chocolate boob, I think.

01:39:48.567 --> 01:39:52.695
Nothing wrong with chocolate
and chocolate sauce.

01:39:52.696 --> 01:39:54.155
All right.
Let's go sit in the shade.

01:39:54.156 --> 01:39:55.324
Yeah, definitely.

01:39:56.825 --> 01:39:58.201
Joel.

01:39:58.202 --> 01:39:59.327
Hey!

01:39:59.328 --> 01:40:00.912
Do you want to go for a swim?

01:40:00.913 --> 01:40:02.371
Yeah, okay!

01:40:02.372 --> 01:40:03.456
Oh, grazie.
You're welcome.

01:40:03.457 --> 01:40:05.124
Grazie.
Grazie mille.

01:40:05.125 --> 01:40:06.334
Oh!
Thank you.

01:40:06.335 --> 01:40:07.335
You like cappuccino?

01:40:07.336 --> 01:40:08.461
Yes, grazie.

01:40:08.462 --> 01:40:09.921
Not for me.
Okay.

01:40:09.922 --> 01:40:11.047
And look, I've got the view.

01:40:11.048 --> 01:40:12.256
It's absolutely beautiful.

01:40:12.257 --> 01:40:13.467
Well, thank you very much.

01:40:14.801 --> 01:40:16.385
This shirt
is rather flattering,

01:40:16.386 --> 01:40:17.512
and I suppose this light

01:40:17.513 --> 01:40:20.431
casts me
in a rather heroic frame.

01:40:20.432 --> 01:40:22.308
It does.
It's very flattering to you.

01:40:22.309 --> 01:40:25.019
Oh.
I need this.

01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:26.145
Yeah.

01:40:26.146 --> 01:40:28.105
Kids diving off there
before today.

01:40:28.106 --> 01:40:29.607
Yeah?

01:40:29.608 --> 01:40:31.817
Great news about your film
as well.

01:40:31.818 --> 01:40:32.860
Thank you very much.

01:40:32.861 --> 01:40:34.237
Amazing.

01:40:34.238 --> 01:40:36.072
I have another announcement,

01:40:36.073 --> 01:40:37.490
uh, to make, actually.

01:40:37.491 --> 01:40:38.534
Really?
Yes.

01:40:40.494 --> 01:40:43.329
I've had a little adventure.

01:40:43.330 --> 01:40:44.413
Right.

01:40:44.414 --> 01:40:45.790
You know the boat
that we went on?

01:40:45.791 --> 01:40:47.375
Yeah.

01:40:47.376 --> 01:40:50.962
I had an...
altercation with a

01:40:50.963 --> 01:40:52.755
a deckhand.

01:40:52.756 --> 01:40:53.798
You had a fight?

01:40:53.799 --> 01:40:55.550
No, no, quite the opposite.

01:40:55.551 --> 01:40:58.094
A-a lady, uh, deckhand,

01:40:58.095 --> 01:41:02.056
who-who
who shivered my timber.

01:41:02.057 --> 01:41:06.477
She-she circumnavigated
my globe.

01:41:06.478 --> 01:41:09.064
She-she scraped the barnacles
from my bottom.

01:41:10.274 --> 01:41:12.608
And she hoisted,
uh, my mainsail.

01:41:12.609 --> 01:41:14.361
I get the picture.
Yes, yes.

01:41:15.779 --> 01:41:19.198
And, of course, the
the thing is...

01:41:19.199 --> 01:41:22.785
I'm thinking about
hopping aboard again

01:41:22.786 --> 01:41:24.912
before we return home.

01:41:24.913 --> 01:41:27.081
Really?
Yes. Yes.

01:41:27.082 --> 01:41:28.958
Slight fly in the ointment,
of course

01:41:28.959 --> 01:41:30.668
wife, small child
back at home.

01:41:30.669 --> 01:41:32.086
Yeah.

01:41:32.087 --> 01:41:34.547
I'm-certainly don't want you
to sit in judgment.

01:41:34.548 --> 01:41:35.548
Oh, Rob, I wasn't.

01:41:35.549 --> 01:41:36.591
Or to profess an opinion.

01:41:36.592 --> 01:41:37.592
Okay.

01:41:37.593 --> 01:41:38.677
But what do you think?

01:41:39.886 --> 01:41:42.263
Oh, God.
Do you know what?

01:41:42.264 --> 01:41:45.600
Hormonal pregnant women
probably aren't the best to ask.

01:41:45.601 --> 01:41:46.934
I don't know, really.

01:41:46.935 --> 01:41:48.312
Ah.

01:41:53.609 --> 01:41:55.027
' Rob!

01:41:57.029 --> 01:41:59.614
Rob, are you gonna come in?

01:41:59.615 --> 01:42:00.823
No, thank you!

01:42:00.824 --> 01:42:02.825
Go out for a swim?

01:42:02.826 --> 01:42:04.577
No, thanks!

01:42:04.578 --> 01:42:06.579
You're missing out!

01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:08.289
I know!

01:42:08.290 --> 01:42:10.583
Ah!
Oh, sit down there.

01:42:10.584 --> 01:42:12.460
â€œ

01:42:12.461 --> 01:42:14.046
Oh, this is relaxing.

01:42:15.631 --> 01:42:18.049
Remember
the end of Roman Holiday,

01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:19.634
when Gregory Peck
and Audrey Hepburn

01:42:19.635 --> 01:42:22.637
have that amazing day
together,

01:42:22.638 --> 01:42:25.181
and then she goes back
to being a princess?

01:42:25.182 --> 01:42:28.267
And she gets told about
her duties as a princess.

01:42:28.268 --> 01:42:29.894
And she says,

01:42:29.895 --> 01:42:32.855
if I wasn't aware
of the importance

01:42:32.856 --> 01:42:36.859
of my duties to my family
and to my country,

01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:39.196
I wouldn't have ever come back.

01:42:42.991 --> 01:42:43.991
Joe.

01:42:43.992 --> 01:42:45.034
Hmm?

01:42:45.035 --> 01:42:46.243
I'm gonna sell the flat.

01:42:46.244 --> 01:42:47.620
Really?
Yeah.

01:42:47.621 --> 01:42:49.246
I'm gonna
I've been thinking about it.

01:42:49.247 --> 01:42:50.665
I'm gonna get a house
near you guys.

01:42:50.666 --> 01:42:52.083
Oh, okay.

01:42:52.084 --> 01:42:53.709
Walking distance.
Yeah.

01:42:53.710 --> 01:42:55.586
So you can come over.

01:42:55.587 --> 01:42:58.798
You maybe could come
and live with me if you wanted.

01:42:58.799 --> 01:43:00.216
Mamie wants to live with Mum.

01:43:00.217 --> 01:43:01.217
Yeah.

01:43:01.218 --> 01:43:03.427
And I don't want
to not be with her.

01:43:03.428 --> 01:43:04.428
Yeah, I know.
I know.

01:43:04.429 --> 01:43:05.554
I mean, no, that's right.

01:43:05.555 --> 01:43:06.764
That's right.
I mean...

01:43:06.765 --> 01:43:10.352
But I'm around the corner
anyway, so you can...

01:43:11.603 --> 01:43:13.229
Have your own key.

01:43:13.230 --> 01:43:14.438
That scene
at the press conference.

01:43:14.439 --> 01:43:15.439
. YeP

01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:18.776
Gregory Peck signals
he's not gonna run the story.

01:43:18.777 --> 01:43:20.904
The photographer
hands back the photos.

01:43:22.114 --> 01:43:23.656
That would never happen now.

01:43:23.657 --> 01:43:25.658
You know they copied that
in Notting Hill?

01:43:25.659 --> 01:43:27.076
You know the scene
in the press conference...

01:43:27.077 --> 01:43:28.077
Oh, yeah!

01:43:28.078 --> 01:43:29.078
With Hugh Grant
and Julia Roberts,

01:43:29.079 --> 01:43:30.162
where he says
he says, Oh, gosh,

01:43:30.163 --> 01:43:31.330
crikey, crikey, gosh.

01:43:31.331 --> 01:43:33.249
I was just wondering, uh,

01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:35.042
if a person realized, uh,

01:43:35.043 --> 01:43:37.462
that that person
had been a daft prick...

01:43:38.672 --> 01:43:40.339
'Whether that person might,
you know,

01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:42.258
sort of get down
on bended knees

01:43:42.259 --> 01:43:44.635
and plead with you
to reconsider,

01:43:44.636 --> 01:43:48.055
whether you might,
in fact, reconsider.

01:43:48.056 --> 01:43:50.725
Well, everyone's a daft prick
sometimes.

01:43:50.726 --> 01:43:52.143
That's my point, yes.

01:43:52.144 --> 01:43:53.728
Yes, that's my point.

01:43:53.729 --> 01:43:55.104
You could come over
with your mum,

01:43:55.105 --> 01:43:56.439
if you want,
for supper one night.

01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:57.690
I'll cook for you.

01:43:57.691 --> 01:44:01.027
Try out my mushroom risotto.

01:44:01.945 --> 01:44:03.738
Sounds good.

01:44:03.739 --> 01:44:05.197
It's a work in progress
at the moment,

01:44:05.198 --> 01:44:07.659
but... I'm getting there.

01:44:11.663 --> 01:44:12.663
Should we go for a swim?

01:44:12.664 --> 01:44:14.166
Yeah, okay.

01:44:15.917 --> 01:44:18.169
Of course, in Netting Hill,

01:44:18.170 --> 01:44:20.838
they run off together.

01:44:20.839 --> 01:44:24.049
None of this
sacrificing love for duty.

01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:25.093
No.

01:44:26.970 --> 01:44:28.972
I prefer
the Roman Holiday ending.

01:44:30.599 --> 01:44:32.184
Unrequited love.

01:44:33.977 --> 01:44:35.187
Don't really do that anymore.

01:44:36.730 --> 01:44:37.981
No.

01:44:43.111 --> 01:44:47.111
