Tara's boyfriend

01:06.960 --> 01:09.475

02:53.440 --> 02:56.319
First thing she says,
"Daddy's not a policeman".

02:57.120 --> 02:59.271
Her class had a visit from PC Plod today.

02:59.520 --> 03:02.433
Oh, yeah? Was it stranger danger?
Just say no?

03:03.240 --> 03:04.435

Apparently real policemen wear a uniform:
Funny hat, fancy vest.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.392
"Why doesn't daddy have to wear a hat?"

03:11.520 --> 03:14.672
Oh, cos I've still got my own hair.
You've got to show it off at my age.

all sorts of policemen:

03:25.440 --> 03:27.432
There's the ones that visit schools

03:27.520 --> 03:30.513

12:42.640 --> 12:43.756
The radio's on low.

12:43.840 --> 12:44.840
<i>TRAIN CHUGGING.</i>

12:44.920 --> 12:46.673
There's the sound of a train approaching.

12:47.920 --> 12:48.920
Are you alone?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.514
- No.
- ROSE: Who's with you?

12:51.640 --> 12:52.640
My sisters.

12:53.960 --> 12:54.960
Mum, Dad.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.800
Everybody's laughing.

12:58.720 --> 12:59.720
ROSE: What's so funny?

13:02.040 --> 13:03.713
There's a pancake stuck to the ceiling.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.080
We're waiting for the train to go by
to see if it'll shake it off.

13:09.800 --> 13:10.800
How do you feel?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.150
How do you feel?

13:25.840 --> 13:28.136
GABE'S VOICE DISTORTED:
<i>There was old lady that swallowed a spider</i>

13:28.160 --> 13:30.880

<i>I don't know why...</i>
Very good, you're coming through.

Can you hear us?
GABE: I can hear you fine.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.176
BOARD MEMBER:
In the interest of protecting

13:40.200 --> 13:41.600
the anonymity of our witness

13:41.680 --> 13:45.390
I'd like to remind the board
to refrain from asking any questions

13:45.480 --> 13:48.075
that reference specific dates
and locations.

13:49.680 --> 13:53.037
To our witness, I'd like to note,
before we begin

13:53.880 --> 14:00.434
that we will be considering the parole
of inmate Thomas Wheelan, alias Skittles.

14:01.800 --> 14:08.115
<i>Witness, can you describe the nature
of your relationship with Mr Wheelan?</i>

14:09.080 --> 14:11.595
NORMAL VOICE:
I was working under-cover for five years

14:11.680 --> 14:15.435

DISTORTED VOICE:
<i>Based primarily in West Yorkshire.</i>

14:17.920 --> 14:19.798
<i>Mr Weelan was a high-ranking member.</i>

14:21.920 --> 14:23.096
BOARD MEMBER: <i>But that's not how.</i>

14:23.120 --> 14:25.271
<i>Mr Wheelan would describe
your relationship?</i>

14:26.280 --> 14:28.636
GABE: <i>No, he would consider me
a very close friend.</i>

14:29.280 --> 14:32.591
BOARD MEMBER: And when were you last
in contact with Mr Wheelan?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.679
GABE: <i>Not since his arrest.</i>

14:35.080 --> 14:38.994
<i>Mr Wheelan and his affiliates all believe
that I repatriated overseas.</i>

14:39.360 --> 14:45.630
Witness, Mr Wheelan was sentenced
to 25 years imprisonment.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.472
The judge referred directly
to your testimony in his sentencing.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.950
<i>You... You described Mr Wheelan</i>

14:53.040 --> 14:59.116
<i>as "a living, breathing reign of terror,
with no prospect of rehabilitation".</i>

14:59.560 --> 15:01.552
<i>Do you stand by that statement?</i>

15:01.680 --> 15:04.400
Look at the crime scene photos
from 3 Pine Row.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.032
BOARD MEMBER:
<i>We have the photos in front of us.</i>

15:08.880 --> 15:11.190
You see the cigarette burns
on the victim's chest?

15:14.280 --> 15:19.150
<i>In all the years I knew Mr Wheelan,
I never saw him smoke. Not once.</i>

15:20.760 --> 15:24.037
Halfway through the attack on Mr Singh,
he walked across the street

15:25.040 --> 15:28.875
<i>bought a pack of fags,
walked back into the victim's house</i>

15:29.560 --> 15:31.677
<i>and lit one, just so he could burn him.</i>

15:37.520 --> 15:40.911
So yes, I stand by my statement.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.832
<i>Excuse the language,
but he's a fucking animal.</i>

15:45.320 --> 15:46.674

hanging around Bridge Town.

is supposed to be the idea

30:24.680 --> 30:27.718
that it's kind of like,
sloughed off former skins of hers.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.400
So, that's why all the skin
has this kind of mottled effect.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.120
Almost like it's kind of dripping off her.

30:32.280 --> 30:35.034
So, these, kind of like, I don't know,
like a snake, or something

30:35.120 --> 30:37.032
have kind of, like,
congregated around her feet

30:37.120 --> 30:38.873

So, I'm lying there, stark-bollock naked,
on this, like, plastic sheet.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.656
There was, like,
three or four of them running around

32:36.680 --> 32:38.936
stacking me with ice packs,
asking me all sorts of questions

32:38.960 --> 32:41.040
and I'm like,
"Sorry, love, I can't answer right now.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.594
I am literally freezing my tits off".

32:43.480 --> 32:45.551

you're responsible for it.

Just read that part.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.516
Yeah, but everyone believed him,
so doesn't that make him real anyway?

37:19.920 --> 37:20.920
Valid point.

37:21.760 --> 37:22.760
He probably is real.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.193
He probably he casts spells

when that wanker ran the red
and kept going.

38:44.560 --> 38:45.835
I got her to A&E just in time.

38:47.720 --> 38:50.952
She was unconscious, of course.
Has no idea what a hero I was.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.355
Did they catch the driver?

38:53.640 --> 38:55.757
Yeah, he was an Aussie on his gap year.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.835
His parents shelled out
for a very persuasive lawyer

38:58.920 --> 39:01.310
so he made bail, bought a ticket
for the next flight back.

39:02.560 --> 39:03.789
Never made his plane though.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.597
Got mugged on the way home
from his leaving do.

39:07.120 --> 39:11.353
They took his wallet, his passport,
broke both his legs.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.514
Was this when you were undercover?

39:17.800 --> 39:20.918
Your tattoos are part of a legend,
I assume.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.231
Unless you're an actual fascist.

39:24.920 --> 39:25.990
I can't talk about it.

39:30.480 --> 39:33.359
Well, I can.
I never get to bitch about this.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.636
Can you imagine, Holly,
waking up to those every day!

39:36.800 --> 39:39.520
You can forget going to the beach,
the amount of dirty looks we get.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.056
It's not like I can just say,
"Oh, it's alright.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.400
My husband was just undercover".

39:43.000 --> 39:45.560
Can't talk about it.
It's not me, it's the law.

39:47.120 --> 39:50.431
EMILY: Holly, can you tell me
where it says in the police rule book

39:50.520 --> 39:51.954
you have to keep those things?

39:54.800 --> 39:58.316
GABE: Hey, didn't we tell Lori about this?
- About what?

39:58.400 --> 40:00.336
GABE: Cans go in the recycling,
this was in the bin.

40:00.360 --> 40:01.635
Oh, it's not Lori's, it's mine.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.479
Oh, my mistake.

40:06.920 --> 40:07.920
Yeah, I had a cigarette.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.576
More than one by the looks of it.
Alright, a couple.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.496
GABE: I thought you were gonna give up
after we had Lori.

40:12.520 --> 40:13.880
EMILY: Oh my God. Are you serious?

40:13.920 --> 40:16.800
GABE: Well, you asked me to help you.
I can't help you, if you lie to me.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.833
I don't think Holly wants to hear this.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.080
Where's the pack?

40:33.680 --> 40:34.680
EMILY: Fucking happy?

40:38.920 --> 40:40.115
Ah, course.

40:49.360 --> 40:50.476
GABE TALKING INDISTINCTLY

40:50.560 --> 40:51.835
Let that be a lesson, Holly.

40:52.640 --> 40:55.520
If you want to get on with my husband,
don't ask about his good old days.

40:56.080 --> 40:59.437
I am pretty sure
it <i>was</i> in the recycling... The can.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.595
Well, you don't miss much, do you?
No.

41:05.680 --> 41:06.680
GABE ON PHONE: OO.

41:08.920 --> 41:09.960
GABE: Hey, we've gotta go.

41:11.440 --> 41:12.510
HOLLY: Thanks for dinner.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.416
GABE: I thought you were gonna
to keep your eye on them?

41:32.440 --> 41:34.240
I could hardly go running after them,
could I?

41:34.280 --> 41:35.776
GABE: You're not gonna be
running after anybody

41:35.800 --> 41:37.040
with that pirate limp, are you?

41:37.160 --> 41:39.038
Ah, it's all part of the legend now.

41:39.760 --> 41:41.797
Besides the devils in the detail.

41:43.920 --> 41:44.956
GABE: Just lay low there.

41:45.360 --> 41:46.360

Hey, control says you've got
an IC3 and an IC4 armed with bike helmets.

42:04.880 --> 42:07.111
Yeah, two males, twenties. Long gone.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.517
HOLLY: Managers in the back?
- Yeah, through there.

OFFICER: Right. Where do you want me skip?
- Ah, just go around the back.

42:21.480 --> 42:22.480
MY RAHIM: CTSU?

42:22.840 --> 42:23.840
What's that all about?

42:23.880 --> 42:25.997
Can you show us
the security camera footage, please?

42:30.520 --> 42:32.680
MY RAHIM: My nephew, Bang,
set this system up last year

42:32.720 --> 42:33.720
state of the art.

42:36.120 --> 42:37.120
GABE: Great.

42:41.480 --> 42:44.120
MY RAHIM: Check this out.
16 channels, always something on.

42:46.240 --> 42:48.391
So, here's them boys. Look. Look.

42:49.560 --> 42:50.391
You see that?

42:50.480 --> 42:52.560
GABE: Yeah.
- MY RAHIM: Good job I wasn't there, man.

42:52.640 --> 42:54.736
I'd have done some damage to them.
You'd be arresting me.

42:54.760 --> 42:56.831
D'you know what I'm talking about?
HOLLY: Mmhm.

42:57.320 --> 42:58.879
Then, look. Him as well. Look.

43:00.440 --> 43:01.999
Oh! GABE: Mm.

Bring up camera number six.

43:06.800 --> 43:08.029
MY RAHIM: Bloody bike helmet.

43:08.280 --> 43:09.760
Spiros nearly bit his tongue off.

43:11.960 --> 43:12.996
It's disgusting.

43:15.320 --> 43:16.320
Animals.

43:17.280 --> 43:19.000
It's all that drugs and drink.
GABE: Yeah.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.476
MY RAHIM: Stole thirty quid's worth
of chicken and all.

43:22.480 --> 43:24.676
Look. Look. Never getting that back, am I?

43:25.440 --> 43:26.760
- GABE: No.
- MY RAHIM: Hooligans.

43:27.160 --> 43:29.311
Your lot are letting the city go to hell.

43:30.520 --> 43:31.520
Yeah, yeah.

43:32.160 --> 43:35.153
Is all this footage on that memory stick?
MY RAHIM: Yes.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.153
When you catch these little bastards

43:38.320 --> 43:40.118
make sure you give them a good hiding,
yeah?

43:40.200 --> 43:41.236
Only way they'll learn.

43:43.240 --> 43:44.400
Where're you going with that?

43:44.640 --> 43:46.757
I'm gonna catch the bastards.
Give 'em a hiding.

43:47.600 --> 43:50.240
Good and don't be shy.

43:50.640 --> 43:52.916
Oh, we won't.

You recruited Raza Shar, for yourself?

44:08.120 --> 44:09.190
He was a good spot.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.958
Anyway, after your paedo skit
with his mum

44:12.040 --> 44:13.599
you can't run him, I can.

44:17.800 --> 44:20.076
IMRAN: Oh, don't tell me
our man's already bottled it.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.993
He committed a serious assault.

44:22.440 --> 44:23.760
Instead of blowing his cover.

44:25.360 --> 44:26.360
Boy's a natural.

44:41.320 --> 44:42.320
Ah!

44:44.400 --> 44:45.629
It'll wake up your brother.

44:56.800 --> 44:57.995

- SADI: Here.

44:58.360 --> 44:59.510
There's a look I know.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.599
That's a man with a proper hangover.

45:02.360 --> 45:04.113
Sit down, I'll fix you a Hanif special.

45:10.560 --> 45:12.517
Rubbing shoulders with the luvies?

45:13.000 --> 45:14.719
You never told me about your girlfriend.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.856
HANIF: Here you go.
- Where are you hearing all this?

45:17.880 --> 45:20.475
Well, you complain
like I'm the bloody Stasi

45:20.720 --> 45:22.376
but, you know,
your friend was polite enough

45:22.400 --> 45:24.073
to answer all my questions.

45:24.920 --> 45:27.310
Mrs Shar,
you really shouldn't spoil me like this.

45:27.680 --> 45:28.875
I'll be here every morning.

45:31.120 --> 45:32.315
What's up with you?

45:33.240 --> 45:34.879
Nothing, uh, I'm good.

45:36.560 --> 45:38.240
SADIA: So, how do you two know each other?

45:38.680 --> 45:40.512
Oh, Raz didn't tell ya?
We met in jail.

45:41.520 --> 45:42.520
FAMILY LAUGH

45:49.040 --> 45:52.158
SADIA: No, I think he must have forgotten
to tell me that.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.959
HANIF LAUGHING: Jail. Ha. Yeah.

45:54.600 --> 45:55.600
That's a good one.

HOLLY: Does Rose know
you're running Source 9, without me?

46:06.360 --> 46:07.416
Don't worry. I'll pass it on.

46:07.440 --> 46:09.830
HOLLY: I put Raza Shar on your radar.
You said it yourself.

46:10.160 --> 46:11.200
I should run him with you.

46:11.800 --> 46:12.995
GABE: Holly, you bolloxed it.

46:13.280 --> 46:16.671
That's new territory for you.
Raza's just a means to an end.

46:19.960 --> 46:21.076
You slept here last night?

46:22.920 --> 46:24.752
Yeah, dinner wasn't
such a hit for everyone.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.229
- See you in the brief.
- Mm.

46:29.800 --> 46:30.800
PHONE RINGS

46:37.240 --> 46:38.833
WORALL: El Aduoa followed a pattern:

46:38.920 --> 46:42.755
Embed in a city, stablish a cell,
teach them how to build explosives.

46:43.160 --> 46:45.197
The Italian police
found the Turin attack cell

46:45.280 --> 46:47.112
sitting on a hundred canisters of butane.

46:47.520 --> 46:50.479
That matches the Dutch estimates
based on the blast radius from Rotterdam.

46:51.040 --> 46:53.874
COOPER: Working theory is El Aduoa
may well have continued that method

46:53.960 --> 46:54.960
here in London.

46:55.040 --> 46:56.600
HOLLY: How did they acquire the butane?

46:57.080 --> 46:59.117
The same purchase pattern
was used by both cells:

46:59.200 --> 47:00.998
Always on gift cards, one can at a time.

47:01.320 --> 47:03.551
Multiple vendors within a 60-mile radius.

47:03.640 --> 47:05.040
Then we should canvas the vendors:

47:05.800 --> 47:07.359
Petrol stations, garden centres.

47:07.520 --> 47:09.716
What are we circulating?
We have no suspects.

47:10.040 --> 47:12.635
Just get 'em nervous
anytime someone asks to light a barbecue.

47:14.120 --> 47:17.397
How did the train cell plan on moving
a hundred canisters of butane?

47:17.640 --> 47:21.429
AISI recovered a stolen Fiat Ducato
from a Turin farm-house.

47:22.280 --> 47:24.875
What... What about the Ford Transit
that was tailing Yousef?

47:25.200 --> 47:26.640
WORALL: Uh, it's comparable in size.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.696
But there's two and a half million
white vans on this island

47:29.720 --> 47:30.995
and not enough of us.

47:32.640 --> 47:35.030
Well, just cross check MIT's list
for Ford Transits.

47:35.120 --> 47:36.120
WORALL: Yeah, OK.

47:41.240 --> 47:43.630
HOLLY: We should just ask them
to send over the transcripts.

47:43.720 --> 47:45.996
GABE: What we're looking for
won't be in the transcripts.

47:46.360 --> 47:47.640
To see it, we've gotta be there.

47:57.840 --> 48:00.309
SID: You missed a spot.
There's almost a full sentence here.

48:01.560 --> 48:04.280
Is this all you can give us?
It's all that can be written down.

48:04.640 --> 48:07.758
Bloody CTSU,
always wanna play blind man's bluff.

48:08.640 --> 48:11.030
We have a drug dealer,
gets a bullet for his troubles

48:11.120 --> 48:13.680
not to mention someone took the time
to bleach the car.

48:13.920 --> 48:16.037
That means I've got physical evidence
for shite.

48:17.120 --> 48:18.793
Now counter terror is sniffing about

48:18.960 --> 48:22.351
and my antennae's picking up
a matter of national security.

48:24.920 --> 48:27.754
Yousef was a source
in an ongoing CT investigation.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.195
SID: We're warmer, OK.

48:30.600 --> 48:33.069
His form doesn't exactly reflect
the pious sort.

48:33.240 --> 48:36.312
HOLLY: Extremist recruiters
often target low level criminals.

48:36.600 --> 48:37.696
They're easier to radicalise

48:37.720 --> 48:39.552
than people who actually know
the religion.

48:39.840 --> 48:40.840
Lost boys.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.273
That's what Yousef was when I turned him.

48:44.120 --> 48:46.555
HOLLY: Yousef had promised us
high value intelligence.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.798
We think he was killed to keep it quiet.

48:49.600 --> 48:50.795
What's the intel to do with?

48:55.080 --> 48:57.436
No, no, no. Don't go cold on me now.

49:00.320 --> 49:01.879
SID: <i>Yousef texted last weekend.</i>

49:02.520 --> 49:04.034
<i>Were you trying to score?</i>

49:04.520 --> 49:07.991
DISCO DAN: <i>No. No, no, it's...
It's nothing... nothing like that.</i>

49:08.480 --> 49:10.915
<i>Right? He was ribbing me
because United lost last weekend.</i>

49:11.800 --> 49:13.792
SID: <i>Last weekend? I thought they drew?</i>

49:14.600 --> 49:16.671
<i>Yeah, yeah. It's all rivalry, innit, mate?</i>

49:18.120 --> 49:19.270

49:39.120 --> 49:41.316
I told you, this is a waste of time.

49:41.960 --> 49:44.919
GABE: Wasn't what Yousef asked for either.
- HOLLY: Oh, he knew the risks.

49:45.280 --> 49:46.280
No he didn't.

49:46.960 --> 49:47.960
They never do.

49:48.800 --> 49:50.154
If they did, they wouldn't do it.

49:51.520 --> 49:53.398
What happened to
"they're not your friends"?

49:53.600 --> 49:55.478
GABE: They're not, but you're theirs.

49:55.800 --> 49:57.075
You know their biggest secret.

49:58.240 --> 50:01.597
All they wanna know is,
are you going to keep it safe?

50:02.520 --> 50:04.910
You lie about anything else.
You don't lie about that.

50:05.480 --> 50:08.678
You can't seriously blame yourself
for Yousef's choice.

50:09.880 --> 50:11.280
I remember his choice.

50:12.680 --> 50:14.114
He had five years over his head.

50:14.560 --> 50:16.040
I took him to an Arsenal match.

50:16.760 --> 50:19.275
And I told him, "By the time you get out"

50:19.360 --> 50:21.670
you won't recognise
a single player on this pitch".

50:22.000 --> 50:24.117
HOLLY: What about number nine?
What was his choice?

50:25.200 --> 50:26.200
GABE: It doesn't matter.

50:27.080 --> 50:29.311
You don't just send a canary
straight down the mine.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.314
You put a cage around it first.

50:33.840 --> 50:35.440
ROXY: <i>But I don't know more than that.</i>

50:38.800 --> 50:40.712
My stomach is water.
You have something to eat?

50:42.360 --> 50:43.589
SID: <i>Let's get back to Yousef.</i>

50:44.240 --> 50:46.357
I know you had a relationship
with Mr Hassan...

50:46.640 --> 50:48.791
Barely, no strings.

50:53.760 --> 50:54.760
But he was...

50:58.040 --> 50:59.040
<i>He was, um...</i>

51:00.760 --> 51:01.796
But he was gracious.

51:03.320 --> 51:04.320
Not like most boys.

51:05.760 --> 51:07.120
Why anyone hurt him, I don't know.

51:07.560 --> 51:09.480
SID: <i>Last time you spoke,
how did he seem to you?</i>

51:10.480 --> 51:11.880
ROXY:
<i>That was so long ago, innit.</i>

51:12.560 --> 51:13.835
<i>I can't remember when it was.</i>

51:14.120 --> 51:16.056
SID: Phone records show
you were in contact with him

51:16.080 --> 51:17.080
over the weekend.

51:18.720 --> 51:20.518
A lot of boys calling me.
I don't keep track.

51:20.680 --> 51:23.718
Miss Novac, it's a criminal offense
to pervert the course of justice.

51:26.080 --> 51:30.313
Roxy can't eat, Roxy can't talk,
can't walk, can't breathe.

51:31.480 --> 51:32.480
OK.

51:34.080 --> 51:35.080
<i>Roxy does nothing.</i>

51:52.400 --> 51:55.632
POP MUSIC PLAYS: "Where Has Cupid Gone?"

51:56.560 --> 52:00.270

52:10.560 --> 52:13.632
HOLLY: Folic acid for the brain,
Vitamin D for the bones

52:13.720 --> 52:14.720
fish oil for the heart.

52:16.840 --> 52:18.115
How many weeks?

52:19.920 --> 52:21.400
- Ten.
- HOLLY: It's early.

52:21.800 --> 52:23.280
One-a-day, save your money.

52:26.720 --> 52:27.720
ROXY: Thanks.

52:29.080 --> 52:30.912
I still don't really know what I'm doing.

52:31.040 --> 52:32.040
Well, who does?

52:32.240 --> 52:33.800
At least you know you're gonna keep it.

52:34.440 --> 52:35.440
That's brave.

52:38.200 --> 52:39.200
Why are you saying that?

52:39.560 --> 52:41.074
Yousef would've made a good dad.

52:42.320 --> 52:43.320
How do you know Yousef?

52:44.000 --> 52:46.640
ROXY: What the fuck! You followed me?
I've nothing to say to you.

52:47.320 --> 52:49.789
OK. How are you doing?
ROXY: I'm fine. I'm late for work.

52:49.920 --> 52:50.920
HOLLY: You're not fine.

52:51.640 --> 52:53.791
You're pregnant,
the father of your baby is dead

52:53.880 --> 52:56.190
and you're alone wandering
the aisles of the supermarket.

53:05.040 --> 53:08.351
Look, a strawberry.

53:09.480 --> 53:11.000
Next week it will be as big as a kiwi.

53:12.400 --> 53:13.400
I read it online.

53:13.840 --> 53:15.240
Did Yousef know about the baby?

53:16.320 --> 53:17.674
You're the first people to know.

53:20.920 --> 53:24.277
Most girls, they get, um, cakes, balloons.

53:25.320 --> 53:26.879
I get cops stalking me.

53:27.480 --> 53:30.439
Is there anyone you can think of
that might have had cause to harm him?

53:30.880 --> 53:31.916
I wasn't his girlfriend.

53:32.600 --> 53:35.069
He didn't, like, take me out
or meet his mates.

53:36.160 --> 53:37.958
He comes to my place,
he wants one thing.

53:38.560 --> 53:39.560
You know?

53:39.600 --> 53:41.239
HOLLY: You must have met him somewhere.

53:42.040 --> 53:43.554
Yeah, at the restaurant where I work.

53:45.240 --> 53:48.517
He comes one time with these guys.
They're, like, regulars.

53:50.600 --> 53:52.034
And he starts talking to me.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.719
And, yeah, I guess he was a good talker.

53:57.840 --> 53:59.991
The regulars, who are they?
ROXY: I don't know.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.595
They come once a week maybe.

54:01.680 --> 54:03.672
They don't talk to anyone.
They don't talk to me.

54:04.880 --> 54:06.120
They don't really talk English.

54:06.360 --> 54:09.194
Well... well what do they speak?
ROXY: Albanian, I think.

54:11.360 --> 54:15.070
HOLLY: Next time they come in,
would you give me a call?

54:15.160 --> 54:16.656
I don't want anything to do
with these guys.

54:16.680 --> 54:17.680
They have bad energy.

54:21.440 --> 54:22.590
I've got a seven-year-old.

54:24.160 --> 54:25.560
She's in the "why?" phase.

54:26.080 --> 54:29.073
You know, "Why is the sky blue?",
"Why is water wet?"

54:30.440 --> 54:32.909
One day your strawberry
is going to start asking questions.

54:34.200 --> 54:35.200
What happened to dad?

54:36.160 --> 54:37.160
Who hurt him?

54:38.560 --> 54:39.710
Why didn't you catch them?

54:51.320 --> 54:52.834
SIRENS WAILING

55:00.480 --> 55:02.199
Didn't think I'd see you again.

55:05.800 --> 55:07.757
Your friend already booked you a table.

55:11.240 --> 55:15.280
MAN CHANTS IN ARABIC

55:28.000 --> 55:29.514
RAZA: Dadir's brother got shot dead.

55:29.680 --> 55:31.520
What do you care?
You dumped me right in there.

55:31.840 --> 55:34.753
And why do you keep dragging me out
to this two-for-one shit-hole? Hm?

55:37.720 --> 55:39.313
Safest pub in London, this.

55:39.680 --> 55:40.680
Coppers bar.

55:41.240 --> 55:43.596
Nobody you know is coming in here.
Lucy will see to that.

55:45.040 --> 55:46.040
You see the paper today?

55:49.160 --> 55:50.160
Look inside.

55:54.640 --> 55:55.880
I can't be buying no more gear.

55:56.080 --> 55:58.037
GABE: That's yours. You had a good night.

55:59.280 --> 56:00.280
By what metric?

56:01.240 --> 56:02.469
They got a sword at my throat.

56:02.800 --> 56:05.156
Dadir goes mental at some random
in the chicken shop

56:05.240 --> 56:06.833
cos his brother got fucking murdered.

56:08.080 --> 56:09.799
I'm done. I can't go back.

56:10.280 --> 56:12.670
Well, the way I see it,
I'm keeping your mum out of trouble.

56:13.080 --> 56:14.878
So, you've got to get me
someone in trouble.

56:20.920 --> 56:23.037
ROXY: Morning.
Can I get you anything to drink?

56:27.680 --> 56:30.070
I'll have a coffee. Thanks.

56:30.160 --> 56:31.640
MEN TALKING IN ALBANIAN

56:40.880 --> 56:42.997
GABE: I'm looking
for a contact of Dadir's brother.

56:43.480 --> 56:45.790
Maybe Dadir knows him? Some big-shot dude.

56:46.720 --> 56:50.191
RAZA: Big-shot? Like BIG, or like, big?

56:50.680 --> 56:52.160
Big-shot's all I've got to go on.

56:52.240 --> 56:53.400
It's all you've got to go on.

56:54.160 --> 56:56.038
RAZA: Is this the bloke
that murdered Yousef?

56:56.360 --> 56:57.360
GABE: We don't know.

56:57.560 --> 56:59.640
RAZA: Well, I ain't trying
to end up like that, bruv.

57:00.840 --> 57:03.056
Just arrest somebody.
They're doing more than I ever did.

57:03.080 --> 57:04.639
GABE: That's not how this works.

57:04.840 --> 57:06.957
Until we find this big-shot,
you're stuck with me.

57:07.240 --> 57:08.240
RAZA: How long for?

57:08.400 --> 57:10.278
GABE: Could be a day,
could be a lifetime.

57:10.960 --> 57:11.960
RAZA: A lifetime?

57:13.120 --> 57:14.839
Dadir is a hand-grenade.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.515
He rumbles me for a snitch, I'm dead.

57:20.200 --> 57:21.200
You know that, right?

57:23.960 --> 57:25.394
GABE: I've never lost an informant.

57:26.720 --> 57:27.720
I'm not starting now.
