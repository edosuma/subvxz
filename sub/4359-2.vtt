<i> My best friend Ray
thinks it's cool.</i>

00:39.200 --> 00:42.480
<i> My sister Annie

00:43.520 --> 00:45.880
<i> I can't let anyone else know.</i>

some experiment.</i>

00:53.520 --> 00:55.200
<i> But you know something?</i>

00:55.200 --> 00:57.440
<i> I guess
I'm not so average anymore.</i>

01:03.120 --> 01:05.080
We've got
to do something, Ray.

01:05.080 --> 01:06.840
I can't let Annie find me.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.080
What's the deal?

01:08.080 --> 01:11.080
It's my dad's father-daughter
golf tournament.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.320
<i>Annie wants me to be
the daughter.</i>

01:13.320 --> 01:14.280
I hate golf.

01:14.280 --> 01:15.520
Golf is cool.

01:15.520 --> 01:18.200
I happen to be
a 38 handicap.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.280
[Annie]
Alex?

01:19.280 --> 01:20.320
I hate mini-golf

01:20.320 --> 01:21.800
and they have
windmills.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.640
Well, Annie's
a daughter, too.

01:23.640 --> 01:25.200
<i>Let her be the daughter.</i>

01:25.200 --> 01:26.160
[Annie]
Alex!

01:26.160 --> 01:27.760
Cover me.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.280
[Annie]
Alex?

01:37.080 --> 01:39.000
Alex, you in here?

01:41.800 --> 01:43.840
Alex!

01:43.840 --> 01:44.800
Hey.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.560
<i>( Sighing )</i>

01:50.360 --> 01:54.760
Ladies and gentlemen,
to the first tee, George Mack!

01:54.760 --> 01:57.400
Honey,
what do you think?

01:57.400 --> 01:59.560
You're going out
looking like that?

01:59.560 --> 02:01.280
It's all I have
in the house

02:01.280 --> 02:03.640
and who knows if I'll
ever play again?

02:03.640 --> 02:06.200
Besides, it's traditional
golfing attire.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.640
George...

02:07.640 --> 02:09.639
No golf in the house.

02:10.680 --> 02:11.760
<i>( Clears throat )</i>

02:11.760 --> 02:13.480
So, where are the girls?

02:13.480 --> 02:17.400
I believe they're outside.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.440
How long has it been since
you've played golf?

02:20.440 --> 02:21.880
25 years,
give or take

02:21.880 --> 02:25.840
but the tournament has nothing
to do with how good you are.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.880
It gives the
employees a chance

02:27.880 --> 02:30.120
to get together,
have a few laughs

02:30.120 --> 02:31.920
bond with
middle management.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.800
It doesn't hurt
to score points

02:33.800 --> 02:36.920
with Fred Pratt, the new head of R & D
-- politics.

02:36.920 --> 02:39.480
He's upset I got
the GC-161 assignment.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.840
I want to try
to smooth things over.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.760
Does it matter to you
that your daughters

02:44.760 --> 02:46.880
have no interest
in playing golf?

02:46.880 --> 02:48.280
They've never played.

02:48.280 --> 02:49.800
Maybe they'll like it.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.440
Besides, today we're just
going to hit a bucket of balls.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.680
<i>No big deal,
tomorrow's the tourney.</i>

02:55.680 --> 02:58.560
Anyway, you're the one
who's always telling me

02:58.560 --> 03:01.120
I need to spend more
time with the girls.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.800
Well, this is
quality time.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.560
Right-- George, you need
to rotate your hips

03:05.560 --> 03:07.200
and swing
through the ball.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.120
So, who's my partner,
Annie or Alex?

03:10.120 --> 03:13.760
I believe they're
discussing that right now.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.120
Alex, I'm not stupid.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.520
[Ray]
That's not Alex.

03:16.520 --> 03:17.480
I'm telling you--

03:17.480 --> 03:19.040
That's just some puddle.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.840
Raymond, please, she owes me.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.720
I let her borrow my jacket.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.960
I baby-sat
the milligans' two terrors

03:24.960 --> 03:27.200
<i>when she wanted
to see Ruinator 3.</i>

03:27.200 --> 03:29.360
I was the one
that did the sack race

03:29.360 --> 03:32.240
with Dad at
the Company Luau.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.840
You didn't tell me
about the Luau.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.000
Come on, Alex.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.080
Hi, girls.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.600
Time to get out
to the driving range.

03:46.600 --> 03:47.840
Who's my partner?

03:47.840 --> 03:49.640
Ooh, I'd love to, Dad

03:49.640 --> 03:52.040
but I have some
things to do.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.960
Alex is your partner.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.920
Okay, Alex, let's roll.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.560
Good! Now, remember

03:59.560 --> 04:01.280
this means a lot to Dad.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.720
It's a business thing.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.320
Be your smiling self
and you'll be fine.

04:05.320 --> 04:08.000
I just have to hit
the ball, right?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.760
Yeah, and I think you
have to wear a sweater.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.400
Oh, well.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.000
It won't be so bad.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.240
What do you mean?

04:18.240 --> 04:19.880
I have one word
for you:

04:19.880 --> 04:21.959
Golf carts.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.800
Well, okay,
that was a nice swing, honey.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.080
I kept my head down.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.800
Yes, but you have to
transfer your weight.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.200
Here, let me show you.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.880
Nice easy stance.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.400
Head down,
slow backswing.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.320
Left arm straight.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.600
Well, the important thing

04:49.600 --> 04:51.600
is that we're
out here together.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.640
You and me,
father and daughter.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.720
We'll have a great time
in the tourney tomorrow.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.880
Mm-hmm. So when can we
ride the golf carts?

04:59.880 --> 05:01.560
Not yet.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.080
Practice makes perfect.

05:03.080 --> 05:05.120
Ray said the golf carts are fun.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.960
Well, Ray's not here, is he?

05:06.960 --> 05:09.600
Slow down your backswing
this time.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.800
Don't you like
the golf carts?

05:11.800 --> 05:13.880
We'll talk golf carts
in a bit.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.000
Right now I want to see
a nice, easy backswing.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
[Man]
Hey, George Mack!

05:19.000 --> 05:21.520
Fred Pratt-- hey, sport,
how's it going?

05:21.520 --> 05:23.800
Oh, Fred, this is
my daughter, Alex.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.320
Good to meet you, Alex.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.840
My daughter, Monica,
will be along soon.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.360
She's got quite a game.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.160
Perhaps the two of you
could get together

05:32.160 --> 05:34.800
and develop a little
friendly rivalry.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.800
I think I'll just
get a soda.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.400
I didn't know you played.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.680
<i>( Both chuckle )</i>

05:39.680 --> 05:43.200
Hey, that's, uh, quite
an outfit you've got there.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.560
Uh, yeah, it's, um,
traditional golfing attire.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.480
Right. You mind
if I hit one?

05:48.480 --> 05:50.520
Oh, be my guest.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.560
Hmm...

06:14.560 --> 06:16.320
<i>( Sighs )</i>

06:16.320 --> 06:17.840
Excuse me?

06:19.320 --> 06:22.560
<i>I'm looking for Watson's
quantum mechanics applied.</i>

06:22.560 --> 06:23.680
I can't find it.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.160
The Dewey decimal system

06:25.160 --> 06:27.040
has let down another customer.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.800
Let's see,
quantum mechanics

06:28.800 --> 06:31.560
is that Fords or Chevys?

06:31.560 --> 06:34.880
Quantum mechanics
isn't about automobiles.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.760
Here it is.

06:36.760 --> 06:38.640
Oh, thanks.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.680
Annie, come on.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.680

08:13.320 --> 08:16.480
[Annie] Could you guys
go get the books, please?

08:18.680 --> 08:21.560
Kevin Mickelman came back
from his physics camp

08:21.560 --> 08:23.040
and he is
looking good.

08:23.040 --> 08:26.320
<i>Not only can he solve
some unbelievable equations</i>

08:26.320 --> 08:27.800
but, for the most part

08:27.800 --> 08:30.040
his skin has
really cleared up.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.520
<i>( Sighs, sniffs )</i>

08:31.520 --> 08:33.559
What did you get
for 11?

08:33.559 --> 08:35.480
Annie, must you be
such a barbarian?

08:35.480 --> 08:38.000
I'm telling you
of Kevin's return

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
for a very
specific reason.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.200
You are?

08:41.200 --> 08:43.240
As you may not know,
he's hosting

08:43.240 --> 08:45.680
a big D & D on-line
gala this weekend

08:45.680 --> 08:48.600
and he specifically
told me to invite you.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.960
Kevin... I'm not sure
I remember him.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.200
He has a very
sneaky wizard.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.760
Oh, is he that kid
that they used to call

08:55.760 --> 08:57.320
"Icky-sticky" Mickelman?

08:57.320 --> 09:00.240
I never used
to call him that.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.440
Yes?

09:01.440 --> 09:02.640
Shh!

09:02.640 --> 09:05.480
I know you have
a very active social life

09:05.480 --> 09:07.200
but this is a library.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.760
<i>I know exactly
where we are, believe me.</i>

09:09.760 --> 09:11.640
You want me
to call the cops?

09:11.640 --> 09:14.840
No, I'm sorry, we'll try
to keep it down.

09:14.840 --> 09:18.360
People like that...
Ugh!

09:18.360 --> 09:20.000
Georgie,
you going to enter

09:20.000 --> 09:22.440
the father-daughter
tournament tomorrow

09:22.440 --> 09:24.800
or stand around
showing off your duds?

09:24.800 --> 09:26.080
I'm really not sure.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.480
Not too shabby, huh?

09:28.760 --> 09:31.080
She's played since
she was six.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.480
She's also an excellent
tennis player.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.840
That's great, Fred,
you must be proud.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.240
I hear promotions
are doing fantastic...

09:38.240 --> 09:40.480
Monica, hit one
with your five iron.

09:40.480 --> 09:44.160
Her middle irons are
the strongest part of her game.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.920
Alex, where
have you been?

09:49.920 --> 09:51.520
It's a long story.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.600
<i>( Fred clears throat )</i>

09:53.600 --> 09:54.320
Have you met my daughter?

09:54.320 --> 09:55.400
Oh, uh, Alex

09:55.400 --> 09:57.760
this is Fred's daughter,
Monica Pratt.

09:57.760 --> 10:01.400
Monica was showing your dad
a thing or two about golf.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.320
You like golf?

10:02.320 --> 10:04.480
Oh, yeah,
love it.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.840
Well, I hope you don't
take after your old man.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.400
Monica, why don't you
show the Macks

10:10.400 --> 10:12.960
a thing or two
about the five iron?

10:16.160 --> 10:18.440
I like the wooden clubs.

10:18.440 --> 10:19.800
Oh, you do,
do you?

10:19.800 --> 10:23.880
Yeah, Dad's been teaching me
to slow down my backswing

10:23.880 --> 10:25.560
and keep my head down.

10:25.560 --> 10:27.480
[Mr. Mack]
Alex, uh, um...

10:35.920 --> 10:38.840
Is that right, Dad?

10:38.840 --> 10:41.320
That's fine, honey.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.520
Let's go.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.320
See you on the course
tomorrow.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.440
<i>( Snorts )</i>

10:52.600 --> 10:53.680
<i>( Crickets chirping )</i>

10:55.280 --> 10:56.240
Okay.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.680
Start at
the beginning.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.280
There's this guy,
Frank Platt.

10:59.280 --> 11:00.480
Fred Pratt.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.520
He was bragging
about his daughter

11:02.520 --> 11:04.440
what a great golf
player she was

11:04.440 --> 11:05.880
and Dad felt
really bad.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.440
I remembered
what you said

11:07.440 --> 11:09.520
about this meaning
so much to him.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.400
So I kind of whacked one.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.200
I have no sympathy for you.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.040
Now you're stuck.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.560
I couldn't
help it.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.720
It's awful, Annie.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.720
I mean

11:19.720 --> 11:21.760
do you know how
impossible it is

11:21.760 --> 11:23.040
to hit
a golf ball?

11:23.040 --> 11:25.040
You have to keep
your head down

11:25.040 --> 11:26.160
rotate your hips

11:26.160 --> 11:27.400
keep your
arm straight.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.400
Now everyone thinks
I'm a great golf player.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.880
That doesn't
look right.

11:33.880 --> 11:35.400
Maybe you're
supposed to

11:35.400 --> 11:36.840
keep your
hips straight

11:36.840 --> 11:38.160
and rotate
your neck.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.720
I would rather do homework
than play golf.

11:40.720 --> 11:42.160
You have to
go through with

11:42.160 --> 11:44.200
the tournament
tomorrow.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.800
I know, but you
should have seen

11:46.800 --> 11:48.720
the look on Dad's face.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.360
He looked so... proud.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.680
No powers, though, right?

11:52.680 --> 11:54.840
The place is
going to be packed.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.480
I know.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.200
<i>( Ball clatters )</i>

12:00.200 --> 12:03.840
Three... four.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.240
<i>( Panting )</i>

12:05.240 --> 12:06.360
I tell you, it was

12:06.360 --> 12:08.800
the most amazing thing
I have ever seen.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.480
I've read things
like this.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.040
Maybe Alex is just
a natural-born golfer.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.320
You know, Beethoven
never had a lesson.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.440
I guess.

12:16.440 --> 12:19.160
And what about you,
how did you play?

12:19.160 --> 12:20.760
Honestly,
I was miserable.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.000
I remember now

12:22.000 --> 12:23.800
why I haven't
played in 25 years.

12:23.800 --> 12:24.560
It's a terrible game.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.920
Wait a minute.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.880
I thought this wasn't
about how good you are.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.040
This father-daughter
tournament

12:30.040 --> 12:31.240
was supposed to bring
people from work

12:31.240 --> 12:32.800
closer together.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.680
Did you see
Fred Pratt?

12:34.680 --> 12:36.560
Fred Pratt has
the personality

12:36.560 --> 12:37.600
of a barnyard animal.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.240
Oh, George.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.760
<i>( Grunts ) This
doesn't sound like fun.</i>

12:41.760 --> 12:44.120
I know. If it
was up to me

12:44.120 --> 12:45.520
I'd cancel it.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.600
But it means
so much to Alex.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.480
You're a good
father, George.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.320
[Annie]
Golfers leave yet?

12:52.320 --> 12:53.680
Bright and early.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.760
I am so excited
about Alex.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.440
She may have
found something

12:57.440 --> 12:58.560
she really loves.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.440
Really loves?

12:59.440 --> 13:00.440
Something she can

13:00.440 --> 13:01.600
dedicate herself to.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.360
You know

13:02.360 --> 13:03.880
you have your studies

13:03.880 --> 13:05.480
and your
study friends

13:05.480 --> 13:07.120
and your study group.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.640
You're saying I
study too much?

13:08.640 --> 13:11.000
No, no, that's not
what I meant. Um...

13:11.000 --> 13:13.320
Maybe I should
broaden my horizons.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.320
There's many different
types of people

13:15.320 --> 13:16.960
not everybody
has to be a genius.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.920
That's what makes
the world go round.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.760
You have a nice
circle of friends.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.080
<i>( Rapping at door )</i>

13:25.640 --> 13:26.520
Hi.

13:26.520 --> 13:27.760
Hi, Annie.

13:27.760 --> 13:28.560
Hi, Mrs. Mack.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.040
Hi... kids.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.000
Okay,
let's go.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.080
Bye, Mom.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.040
Hey, big guy.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.280
Hey, Scooter!

13:57.280 --> 13:59.080
Alex, this is
Gordon Kramer.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.800
We call him Scooter.
Hi.

14:00.800 --> 14:01.800
Hey, Alex.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.440
George, that
fungus analysis

14:03.440 --> 14:04.680
you did last week

14:04.680 --> 14:06.200
brought a tear
to my eye.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.040
Thanks, Scooter,
it's nice to know

14:08.040 --> 14:09.320
it didn't go
unnoticed.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.600
Oh, beautiful.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.680
It's almost tee time.

14:12.680 --> 14:13.720
Got to go.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.800
See you there
in a minute.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.080
Hey, look
who's here.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.040
Oh, hello,
Fred.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.600
How are you
this morning?

14:25.600 --> 14:26.640
George is trying

14:26.640 --> 14:28.560
to make friends
with the enemy.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.760
Little does he know
we will crush them.

14:30.760 --> 14:33.520
[Announcer]
To the first tee

14:33.520 --> 14:35.520
will be Monica and Frank Platt.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.680
They will be followed

14:37.680 --> 14:39.600
by George and Alex Mack.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.360
It's Pratt!
Fred Pratt!

14:41.360 --> 14:43.560
And you two
are going down.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.800
So, are you
having fun?

14:50.800 --> 14:52.480
Oh, yeah, I love it

14:52.480 --> 14:54.680
hanging out with
all the guys.

14:54.680 --> 14:55.960
Are you?

14:55.960 --> 14:58.600
Sure. This is
going to be great.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.480
You want to drive
the golf cart?

15:00.480 --> 15:02.000
Uh, no.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.120
[Annie]
Pythagoras said that the square

15:07.120 --> 15:09.600
of the hypotenuse
of a right triangle

15:09.600 --> 15:10.920
is equal to the sum

15:10.920 --> 15:12.960
of the square
of its two sides.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.160
No, the only way to
figure out the hypotenuse

15:15.160 --> 15:16.920
is to square the legs
of the angle.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.880
Euclid.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.720
You're mixing the
ideas of euclid

15:20.720 --> 15:22.360
with those
of Pythagoras.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.480
Neither mentions
the hypotenuse.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.440
Excuse me?

15:25.440 --> 15:27.360
I couldn't help
overhearing

15:27.360 --> 15:29.400
but it was euclid
who proved

15:29.400 --> 15:32.360
that the sum of the
three interior angles

15:32.360 --> 15:34.880
equals the sum of
two right angles.

15:34.880 --> 15:35.960
Hey, he's right.

15:35.960 --> 15:36.960
I remember

15:36.960 --> 15:38.680
Professor Stevens
mentioned that.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.760
<i>What about your
hypotenuse</i>

15:40.760 --> 15:41.840
Mr. Bossy Boots?

15:41.840 --> 15:43.000
My hypotenuse?

15:43.000 --> 15:46.200
I had my hypotenuse
surgically removed.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.440
Huh.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.880
To tee off, Monica Platts

15:53.880 --> 15:56.000
then her father, Frank Platts.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.440
<i>( Applause )
[Mr. Mack] Nice shot.</i>

16:01.440 --> 16:03.640
See how she keeps
her head still?

16:03.640 --> 16:05.880
Yeah, nice.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.080
What a show-off.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.120
<i>( Birds chirping )</i>

16:20.800 --> 16:22.400

16:26.400 --> 16:28.880
I think you need
to rotate your hips

16:28.880 --> 16:31.400
a bit more,
Mr. Platt.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.160
Come on, Alex.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.640
That's not very
sportsmanlike.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.680
[Announcer]
Next up, Alex Mack.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.080

18:46.160 --> 18:48.600
Well, this isn't a day
I'll soon forget.

18:48.600 --> 18:49.720
Me neither.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.280
18 holes sure seems
like a lot, though.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.080
Why don't they
just make it

18:54.080 --> 18:55.160
ten or something?

18:55.160 --> 18:56.120
I don't know.

18:56.120 --> 18:57.920
Golf's a weird game.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.920
We haven't done
anything like this

19:00.920 --> 19:02.320
just you and me

19:02.320 --> 19:03.440
in a long time.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.920
Are you sure you
don't want to drive?

19:05.920 --> 19:06.880
Positive.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.480
Yesterday I
could have sworn

19:08.480 --> 19:09.680
you wanted to drive.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.600
Skipper, what are
you doing here?

19:11.600 --> 19:13.720
The whole tournament
is on the line.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.720
Oh, hey, Scooter.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.000
We just
weren't that...

19:16.000 --> 19:17.040
Interested.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.680
Oh, well, interested or not

19:18.680 --> 19:19.880
Pratt's on the 18th.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.480
And if he misses this putt

19:21.480 --> 19:22.280
you guys win.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.280
We do?

19:26.440 --> 19:27.680
Thanks,
Scooter.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.000
Hey, hello.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Hey.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.400
Um, you got a minute?

19:50.400 --> 19:52.320
I think the library
will survive.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.800
For a minute.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.680
I just wanted to apologize

19:56.680 --> 19:57.800
for my friends.

19:57.800 --> 19:58.800
For?

19:58.800 --> 20:00.440
Being snobs.

20:00.440 --> 20:03.360
See, we're all in the gifted
program at West High

20:03.360 --> 20:04.320
and Rona

20:04.320 --> 20:06.680
actually, all of us

20:06.680 --> 20:10.120
well, we kind of assumed
that you were just...

20:10.120 --> 20:11.920
You saw me
empty garbage

20:11.920 --> 20:13.720
and dust
and file books.

20:13.720 --> 20:17.480
You thought I was
less than a genius.

I'm Annie Mack.

20:21.840 --> 20:22.920

you know the first
thing they teach you

20:25.440 --> 20:27.560
when you get a job
at the library?

20:27.560 --> 20:28.720
What?

20:28.720 --> 20:31.360
Don't judge a book
by its cover.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.240
I'm off in
a few minutes.

20:33.240 --> 20:33.960
Wait up.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.400
I'll walk with you.

if we lost?

Would you?

you first.

golf, Dad.

you did.

I didn't really

21:17.440 --> 21:18.920
but I thought
you did.
