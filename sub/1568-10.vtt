WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.335
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.962 --> 00:05.129
Blood has answered blood.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.674
The body will be given
to the people of Tondc.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.425
Only then can we have peace.

00:09.635 --> 00:11.344
When it's over,
we talk about how

00:11.553 --> 00:13.096
to get our people
out of Mount Weather.

00:13.305 --> 00:15.223
We want the same
things, Clarke.

00:15.432 --> 00:17.350
Peace with the grounders is
the only way we'll survive.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.394
They're being led
by a child.

00:19.603 --> 00:21.354
So are we.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.856
We need their army to get
to Mount Weather, Bellamy.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.692
What we need
is an inside man,

00:25.901 --> 00:26.985
someone to be
our eyes and ears.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.695
I found something.

00:28.904 --> 00:30.530
That leads to an antenna
on the ground.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.365
If we can access the radio,
we can send a message

00:32.574 --> 00:35.201
over the Arkwide channel,
tell them we're here.

00:35.411 --> 00:36.869
Listen to this.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.746
47 of us are trapped inside
Mount Weather.

00:38.956 --> 00:39.872
Please hurry.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.040
You were right.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.417
Without someone
on the inside

00:42.626 --> 00:44.502
to lower their defenses,
turn off the acid fog,

00:44.712 --> 00:46.379
an army is useless.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.547
You should go.

00:47.756 --> 00:50.675
I can get you
through the tunnels.

01:24.168 --> 01:26.794
OK.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.629
So we make it
to the intake door

01:28.839 --> 01:30.673
without any of the real
reapers seeing us.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.550
What happens then?

01:32.760 --> 01:36.387
I kill everyone,
and you slip inside.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.681
Limestone.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.567
Let's go.

01:49.777 --> 01:52.361
We have a lot of ground
to cover before dark.

01:52.571 --> 01:56.699
I needed to know what
happened after the intake door.

01:56.909 --> 01:57.909
They remove
your clothes,

01:58.118 --> 01:59.368
blast you
with boiling water,

01:59.578 --> 02:00.369
and douse you
with something

02:00.579 --> 02:01.621
that burns
even worse.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.748
From there,
we were sorted.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.084
The others were
tagged harvest.

02:06.293 --> 02:09.087
I was tagged Cerberus,
turned into a reaper.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.130
Cerberus,
3-headed dog

02:11.340 --> 02:13.883
that guards
the underworld.

02:14.093 --> 02:17.136
My mom read mythology
to us all the time.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.388
Octavia loved it.

02:23.018 --> 02:26.771
You're good for her.
You made her strong.

02:28.565 --> 02:33.152
She was already strong.

02:33.362 --> 02:36.280
Hey, I need to ask
you something.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.033
You protected my sister
before you even knew her.

02:39.243 --> 02:40.868
Why?

02:48.252 --> 02:51.212
When I was a boy,

02:51.421 --> 02:53.756
I saw a ship
fall from the sky

02:53.966 --> 02:56.300
like raven's.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.845
The man inside was hurt,
his body broken.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.221
I couldn't
get him out.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.056
Suicide by earth.

03:02.266 --> 03:03.766
I heard the stories
in the guard.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.726
I just didn't know
they were true.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.812
I brought him
food, water.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.772
I didn't speak the
enemy's language yet.

03:09.982 --> 03:12.441
So I couldn't understand
him, but I wanted to.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.694
So on the third day,
I told my father.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.407
He made me kill him.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.244
The world has been
trying to turn me

03:23.453 --> 03:25.621
into a monster for as
long as I can remember.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.457
Let's keep moving.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.129
Wait.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.214
Parking garage
where we found you,

03:35.424 --> 03:37.842
it's north,
that way.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.343
There's
a mine entrance

03:39.553 --> 03:41.929
closer to where
the reapers hand us over.

03:42.139 --> 03:46.142
We'll go into the underworld
when we have to, not before.

03:55.194 --> 03:57.778
Open the gate!

04:26.141 --> 04:28.726
Thought we'd start
with a reception,

04:28.936 --> 04:30.937
then move on
to training.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.897
We have a lot to learn
from each other.

04:35.525 --> 04:38.694
Weapons there, please.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.529
Only our guards
are armed here.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.713
Thank you for
agreeing to this, Indra.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.424
We're here on the
commander's orders.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.719
I agreed
to nothing.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.931
Please. We'll begin
in a moment.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.020
Well, it's a start.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.939
It's a mistake.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.024
I convinced Abby
to release you.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.443
Don't make me
regret that.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.866
Let me tell you
how this ends, Marcus.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.121
Either we lose and
Mount Weather kills us all

05:30.330 --> 05:34.542
or we win our
new friends do.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.377
I thought
you had faith.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.713
This is their land,
and believing

05:38.922 --> 05:41.257
that they'll let us live
here happily ever after

05:41.466 --> 05:43.384
isn't faith.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.677
It's stupidity.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.304
You're wrong.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.055
It's common sense.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.932
There's enough here
for everyone.

05:50.142 --> 05:51.726
We just need
to make them see

05:51.935 --> 05:56.105
that it's in their
interest to share,

05:56.315 --> 05:58.858
and that starts
today.

06:17.711 --> 06:21.172
All right.
Quiet down.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.426
Indra, please.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.142
Don't worry. My shock Baton
has got your back.

06:33.352 --> 06:36.437
How about you stick it
up your ass instead?

06:36.646 --> 06:40.191
I know we don't have
a lot in common,

06:40.400 --> 06:45.696
but we do have a common enemy
and a common goal.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.198
For us to reach it,

06:47.407 --> 06:50.076
to get our people
out of Mount Weather,

06:50.285 --> 06:52.161
we need to work together...

06:59.878 --> 07:02.171
Our survival depends
on us sharing your knowledge...

07:02.381 --> 07:03.255
Do you got
a problem?

07:07.177 --> 07:09.470
I'm sorry, man.
I don't speak grounder.

07:13.183 --> 07:17.353
Mr. Murphy,
apologize to that man.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.021
For what?

07:19.231 --> 07:20.314
He was the one
who came at me.

07:20.524 --> 07:21.690
Two days'
work detail.

07:21.900 --> 07:22.983
Work detail?
I just told you, I didn't do--

07:23.193 --> 07:25.861
care to make it 3?

07:31.535 --> 07:34.662
You're gonna burn
just like your friend.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.582
Murphy!

07:38.792 --> 07:41.544
Murphy, back off!
Murphy, stop!

07:46.216 --> 07:48.592
Knock it off.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.680
Stop!

07:55.434 --> 07:58.477
Stop.
People, stop!

08:36.683 --> 08:39.351
This argument
is a waste of time.

08:39.561 --> 08:42.062
It is simple.
They can't breathe our air.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.648
Why not just open the door
and be done with it?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.192
Let them burn.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.776
Burn them.
Burn them!

08:47.986 --> 08:49.778
No, because they have
a containment system,

08:49.988 --> 08:52.781
multiple airlocks just like
we had on the ark.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.408
Our inside man
can shut that down.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.327
If he gets inside.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.121
What if we shut it down
from the outside?

08:59.331 --> 09:00.998
You say the dam
gives them power.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.917
Let's take that away.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.920
That dam withstood a
nuclear war, commander.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.214
I highly doubt--

09:08.423 --> 09:11.008
All she offers is no.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.302
Quint...

09:15.222 --> 09:19.099
Apologies, commander,
but the biggest army

09:19.309 --> 09:22.520
we've ever had waits for us
to give it a mission.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.647
The longer that takes,
the more of our people

09:24.856 --> 09:25.981
die inside that Mountain.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.233
It's the same
for all of us.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.068
We've lost
thousands.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.987
How many have
you lost, girl?

09:32.197 --> 09:34.448
She says
she has a plan.

09:34.658 --> 09:38.452
I say waiting for
one man to get inside

09:38.662 --> 09:39.954
is not a very good one.

09:40.163 --> 09:43.207
I agree with quint.
We have an army. Let's use it.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.418
We will after Bellamy
lowers their defenses,

09:46.628 --> 09:47.795
turns off the acid fog.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.256
I don't care how many
men you have.

09:50.465 --> 09:53.259
If you can't get to
your enemy, you can't win.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.886
You are the enemy.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.347
I'm sorry. Have I done
something to offend you?

10:01.017 --> 10:02.893
Yes.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.646
You burned my brother
alive in a ring of fire.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.196
He shouldn't have
attacked my ship.

10:14.406 --> 10:15.990
You're very brave
under the commander's

10:16.199 --> 10:18.534
protection, aren't you?

10:40.015 --> 10:41.849
Quint is right.

10:42.058 --> 10:45.144
Waiting for Bellamy
is not a plan.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.937
It's a prayer,

10:47.147 --> 10:49.523
one that's not likely
to be answered.

10:49.733 --> 10:52.192
Excuse me.
I need some air.

11:07.959 --> 11:08.876
The Mountain
has many eyes

11:09.085 --> 11:11.003
between here
and the tunnels.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.589
From now on, details
must be exact.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.299
What if we run
into real reapers?

11:15.508 --> 11:16.759
Won't they wonder
where you've been?

11:16.968 --> 11:19.345
All they see
is the red.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.181
Once you take it,
nothing else matters,

11:22.390 --> 11:24.350
just how
you'll get more.

11:24.559 --> 11:28.020
How much do you remember
from when you were on it?

11:28.229 --> 11:31.357
Everything.

11:31.566 --> 11:34.151
Turn around.

11:52.921 --> 11:56.090
Not so brave, are
you now, sky girl?

12:13.983 --> 12:16.944
Ahh! Uh! Uh!

12:23.952 --> 12:26.704
Impressive,
aren't they?

12:29.290 --> 12:31.834
What doesn't kill them

12:32.043 --> 12:33.127
makes them stronger.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.296
Yaagh!

12:39.509 --> 12:41.135
I am.

12:44.097 --> 12:47.516
We're supposed to train
together, right?

12:47.726 --> 12:51.019
Only warriors
train here.

12:51.229 --> 12:53.355
I saved your life.

12:53.565 --> 12:54.857
And now
I'm saving yours.

13:10.790 --> 13:15.294
Oh, Byrne, thank God.
Quint--

13:18.006 --> 13:20.007
save yourself.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.524
Save your bullets
for the grounders.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.777
I take it
you don't approve.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.280
I asked you
a question.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.073
Who cares
what I think?

13:45.283 --> 13:46.700
I do...

13:48.578 --> 13:50.078
Or I wouldn't
have asked.

13:50.288 --> 13:53.457
I think the grounders
can go to hell.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.502
I got you off
work detail.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.714
Why?

14:00.924 --> 14:02.257
You knew my son...

14:05.637 --> 14:08.013
And I'd like you to take
me to his grave.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.810
Now that
there's a truce,

14:13.019 --> 14:15.103
it's safe for me to
go and say good-bye.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.897
Well, then you can get
someone else to take you.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.858
I'm told the graves
are unmarked.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.736
You can show me
which is his.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.200
Can hold the mop...

14:29.327 --> 14:31.453
Or you can hold
the gun.

14:50.181 --> 14:53.725
Easy.
Control your breathing.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.435
Squeeze the trigger.
Don't pull it.

14:55.645 --> 14:58.230
Sir, we got
an audience.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.529
Hold your fire.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.118
Keep a solid stance.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.911
Observe.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.795
Would you
like to try?

15:23.673 --> 15:26.633
I could teach you.
Your enemy has guns.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.803
So should you.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.269
It's all right.
I offered.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.063
We don't need
your weapons.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.734
Back to training,
all of you.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.115
Guns could
keep them alive.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.284
It's like they're
afraid of them.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.744
They are.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.871
Legend has it, if a
grounder picks up a gun,

15:56.080 --> 15:57.581
even to shoot
another grounder,

15:57.790 --> 15:58.999
Mount Weather
will wipe out

15:59.208 --> 16:01.043
their entire
village.

16:01.252 --> 16:05.088
Can't have your blood supply
defending themselves, right?

16:07.675 --> 16:09.760
If we don't arm them,

16:09.969 --> 16:12.054
we can't win.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.973
Like hell, we can't.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.853
We don't know enough
about these people.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.730
She sure seems to.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.280
Uh!

16:31.783 --> 16:34.159
For my brother.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.702
Aagh!

16:35.912 --> 16:37.537
Uh!

16:40.375 --> 16:41.249
Aah!

16:44.295 --> 16:46.046
Thank you.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.923
Where's your guard?

16:48.132 --> 16:49.341
He killed her.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.439
The kill
is yours, Clarke.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.747
What is that?

17:20.957 --> 17:22.249
Pauna.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.878
Aah! Aah! Run!

17:27.088 --> 17:29.089
Aah! Aagh! Ohh!

17:35.054 --> 17:37.472
Uh! Yaah! Aah!

17:43.354 --> 17:46.773
We need to hide. This way.
I found something.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.456
What is this place?

18:02.665 --> 18:04.666
It's her
feeding ground.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.505
Let's go.

18:57.053 --> 18:57.969
Run!

19:18.950 --> 19:21.660
Ohh!

19:21.869 --> 19:23.411
Oh...

19:28.251 --> 19:30.168
Uh!

19:30.378 --> 19:32.129
Uh! Leave me!

19:32.338 --> 19:34.256
No way.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.937
Uh!

19:49.147 --> 19:51.356
OK. Hold on.

19:53.151 --> 19:54.818
Give me your sword.

20:06.581 --> 20:09.916
It's extraordinary,
isn't it?

20:10.126 --> 20:12.169
Oh, just give it
a few days.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.546
I may not know everything
that happened

20:14.755 --> 20:16.673
before I got down here,
but I do know something

20:16.883 --> 20:20.135
about what you're
feeling, son.

20:20.344 --> 20:24.139
Don't call me that.
I'm nobody's son.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.267
You made sure
of that.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.937
I remember
your father.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.939
Yeah, right.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.317
Alex Murphy--

20:35.526 --> 20:38.069
convicted of theft
of rationed medicine.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.906
He stole it
to take care of you.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.994
I remember them all.

20:50.249 --> 20:55.629
We're here--
home sweet home.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.470
Graveyard is this way.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.951
Come on.
Let' do this.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.893
Ohh...

21:55.231 --> 21:58.108
You about done?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.776
We got to be
heading back.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.903
How well
did you know him?

22:02.113 --> 22:04.698
Well enough to be
hung for his murder.

22:06.367 --> 22:09.202
Clarke sugar-coated it
for you, didn't she?

22:12.540 --> 22:14.874
What happened
to my son?

22:16.627 --> 22:18.336
12-year-old girl
stabbed him

22:18.546 --> 22:20.547
in the neck with the
knife she took from me.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.802
Why would she
do that?

22:26.012 --> 22:29.889
She couldn't
kill you.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.516
Yeah.

22:31.726 --> 22:32.809
So you got
a lot of blood

22:33.019 --> 22:34.060
on your hands,
chancellor.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.395
Every single
one of them,

22:35.604 --> 22:37.063
including your son,
would still be alive

22:37.273 --> 22:40.317
if you hadn't
sent us down here.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.278
If I didn't send you,
they would have died

22:43.487 --> 22:45.238
on the ark
with the rest of us,

22:45.448 --> 22:46.614
and we would have
never known

22:46.824 --> 22:49.534
that earth
was survivable.

22:49.744 --> 22:53.371
Their sacrifice
is why we are here.

22:53.581 --> 22:57.792
Good can come out of
even the darkest acts, John.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.349
Camp you
is that way.

23:12.558 --> 23:16.061
We'll rest at the
dropship for a while.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.814
Suit yourself.

23:47.885 --> 23:49.219
Time for one more?

23:49.428 --> 23:52.263
Step aside, sky girl.
We're hungry.

23:52.473 --> 23:53.515
Make me.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.521
Fio...

23:59.730 --> 24:02.065
Give this girl
what she wants.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.083
Uh!

24:20.292 --> 24:22.377
Sir?
It's all right.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.796
Let it go.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.591
Let's do this.

24:39.353 --> 24:42.230
Hey, are you gonna
give up that easily?

24:42.440 --> 24:45.108
She wants more,
oblige her.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.746
Indra, stop this.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.043
Huh!

25:06.797 --> 25:10.383
Uh! Uh... ohh!

25:28.277 --> 25:29.569
Uh!
Aagh!

25:34.283 --> 25:36.743
Uh!
Ugh!

26:10.069 --> 26:11.236
I got you.

26:11.445 --> 26:12.529
Huh? Oh.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.616
I got you.

26:16.825 --> 26:17.909
What are you
trying to prove?

26:19.411 --> 26:21.037
Yeah.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.831
What doesn't kill you

26:24.041 --> 26:26.709
makes you stronger.

26:32.341 --> 26:35.635
You should've
left me behind.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.720
Now two will die here
instead of one.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.600
I'm still new
to your culture,

26:42.810 --> 26:45.186
but when someone
saves your life,

26:45.396 --> 26:48.106
my people say
thank you.

26:48.315 --> 26:51.859
I'm serious, Clarke.

26:52.069 --> 26:55.029
To lead well, you must
make hard choices.

26:58.242 --> 27:01.411
Hard choices?
You're telling me that?

27:01.620 --> 27:04.205
I've seen your
strength--it's true--

27:04.415 --> 27:06.082
but now you waver.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.792
You couldn't
kill quint,

27:08.002 --> 27:09.752
couldn't
leave me to die.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.504
That was weakness.

27:11.714 --> 27:13.381
I thought love
was weakness.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.593
Mockery is not
the product

27:16.802 --> 27:19.012
of a strong mind,
Clarke.

27:19.221 --> 27:21.347
You want to know
why I saved you?

27:21.557 --> 27:23.725
Because I need you.

27:23.934 --> 27:27.270
God forbid one of your
generals becomes commander.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.147
You may be
heartless, Lexa,

27:29.356 --> 27:30.690
but at least
you're smart.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.820
Don't worry.

27:36.030 --> 27:37.280
My spirit
will choose

27:37.489 --> 27:39.907
much more wisely
than that.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.367
Your spirit?

27:41.577 --> 27:43.536
When I die,
my spirit will find

27:43.746 --> 27:45.747
the next commander.

27:45.956 --> 27:48.374
Reincarnation.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.126
That's how you
became commander.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.294
How are your
leaders chosen?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.511
It found us.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.851
Don't be afraid,
Clarke.

28:07.061 --> 28:08.186
Death is not
the end.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.937
We are not
dying here.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.106
I need your spirit
to stay where it is.

28:12.316 --> 28:15.943
Then get ready to fight.
He's coming in.

28:16.153 --> 28:18.321
Maybe we let it in.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.489
Over here.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.743
Now!

28:25.204 --> 28:26.829
Go!

28:32.378 --> 28:35.171
Let's go.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.217
Uh...

28:43.389 --> 28:45.098
Oh...

28:49.186 --> 28:51.062
Oh...

28:53.732 --> 28:55.233
What do you want?

28:55.442 --> 28:58.069
You fought like
a child today--

28:58.278 --> 29:00.863
all aggression,
no thought,

29:01.073 --> 29:03.533
no defense, always
leaving yourself

29:03.742 --> 29:05.785
exposed, revealing
your next move

29:05.994 --> 29:07.203
before each strike.

29:07.413 --> 29:10.081
OK. I know.
I got my ass kicked.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.500
That should
make you happy.

29:12.710 --> 29:15.253
It does...

29:15.462 --> 29:18.089
Because you
did not give up.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.884
Strength of spirit
like that is rare.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.970
It must be guided.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.600
Do you know what a
warrior's second is?

29:29.810 --> 29:31.352
An apprentice.

29:31.562 --> 29:33.438
I can make you
a great warrior,

29:33.647 --> 29:35.022
Octavia of
the sky people,

29:35.232 --> 29:36.774
if you're willing
to do what it takes

29:36.984 --> 29:38.943
to become my second.

29:39.153 --> 29:41.654
What's in it for you?

29:41.864 --> 29:45.908
First lesson--
never question me.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.543
OK.

29:57.713 --> 30:00.631
I'm in.
Good.

30:00.841 --> 30:03.634
We'll start
tomorrow.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.691
You sure?
You must be hungry.

30:18.901 --> 30:20.067
No one gives
anything

30:20.277 --> 30:22.236
without expecting
something in return.

30:23.864 --> 30:27.283
That's a cynical way
to go through life, John.

30:27.493 --> 30:28.910
You pull me
off work detail.

30:29.119 --> 30:30.703
You offer me food.

30:30.913 --> 30:33.372
Why are you being
so nice to me?

30:33.582 --> 30:38.127
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.587
That's why
we sent the 100

30:39.797 --> 30:40.713
to the earth
in the first place.

30:40.923 --> 30:42.048
What a load of crap.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.342
You didn't give
a damn about us.

30:44.551 --> 30:45.843
You still don't.

30:46.053 --> 30:47.011
That's why you're not
fighting for those kids

30:47.221 --> 30:48.554
in Mount Weather.

30:48.764 --> 30:51.224
I have to think
of everyone.

30:51.433 --> 30:52.809
I know you don't
want to hear this,

30:53.018 --> 30:55.478
but sometimes you have
to sacrifice a few

30:55.687 --> 30:57.563
to save the many.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.982
Like I said,
good can come

31:00.192 --> 31:01.651
out of even
the darkest acts.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.069
Then you can
take it from me

31:03.278 --> 31:05.738
that no good has come
from any of this.

31:05.948 --> 31:07.740
I was pardoned,
slate wiped clean.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.826
I'm still treated
like dirt.

31:10.035 --> 31:13.287
You made mistakes.
So have I.

31:13.497 --> 31:16.415
Well, I'm nothing
like you, chancellor.

31:16.625 --> 31:19.252
No?

31:19.461 --> 31:22.338
We both should've died
several times over.

31:22.548 --> 31:23.840
We both have suffered

31:24.049 --> 31:26.634
at the hands
of the grounders.

31:26.844 --> 31:28.386
We both have been
betrayed and imprisoned

31:28.595 --> 31:30.388
by our own people.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.431
So there's no place
for either of us, then.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.100
Great.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.351
Thought you
were supposed

31:35.561 --> 31:38.062
to be inspiring.

31:38.272 --> 31:40.731
There is a place
for all of us.

31:45.153 --> 31:47.196
When I first
landed on the earth,

31:47.406 --> 31:49.365
I met a woman
who spoke of a place

31:49.575 --> 31:51.909
beyond the dead zone,

31:52.119 --> 31:54.495
a place where
everyone is accepted...

31:56.415 --> 31:58.916
A city of light.

31:59.126 --> 32:00.751
Heh. That sounds
like a fairy tale.

32:00.961 --> 32:01.878
Or a second chance.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.212
You don't even know
if it's real.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.089
You're right--
I don't--but I believe.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.845
OK.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.889
Well, that's good
for you, chancellor.

32:16.018 --> 32:17.727
Very good.

32:21.815 --> 32:25.067
I'm gonna
find it, John...

32:26.945 --> 32:30.072
And once I do,

32:30.282 --> 32:33.367
I'm gonna come back
and lead my people home.

32:50.510 --> 32:53.012
Why are we stopping?

33:04.650 --> 33:06.651
You OK?

33:06.860 --> 33:08.277
A soon as they open
the intake doors,

33:08.487 --> 33:09.654
we attack.

33:09.863 --> 33:11.822
Do not let it close.

33:12.032 --> 33:13.074
Once they're all
dead, you go in.

33:13.283 --> 33:15.451
I'll make it look
like you escaped.

33:15.661 --> 33:19.455
Once you're inside--
I know.

33:24.378 --> 33:26.712
Another raider party.

33:26.922 --> 33:28.089
What are you doing?

33:28.298 --> 33:29.674
We have to go back.
It's the only way.

33:29.883 --> 33:30.841
Go back? No way.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.009
There's 3, maybe 4.

33:32.219 --> 33:33.302
We can fight
our way through.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.595
We'll never get
a better chance than this.

33:34.805 --> 33:35.972
I thought I could do
this, but I can't.

33:36.181 --> 33:38.641
It's over.
No. It's not.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.310
We can join them.
Listen to me.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.478
When they bring
out the red,

33:42.688 --> 33:44.146
you grab it,
and you run like hell.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.398
The reapers
will go nuts,

33:45.607 --> 33:46.691
the grounders will run,

33:46.900 --> 33:48.234
and the Mountain men
have to deal with it.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.860
No one will be looking
for a grounder

33:50.070 --> 33:51.153
running into
the Mountain.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.155
I said no!

33:54.282 --> 33:56.492
Rrgh! Fight back.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.703
They'll think
I'm trying to escape.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.630
Eat.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.257
Get strong.

34:53.467 --> 34:56.427
Only then
will we win this war.

35:04.978 --> 35:07.104
Thank you.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.074
Yeah. Yeah.
Let's line up.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.200
Let's line up
right here.

35:19.409 --> 35:20.785
Yeah. Sure.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.543
You did this.

35:29.753 --> 35:30.961
Thank you.

35:31.171 --> 35:34.423
You're welcome.
Don't blow it.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.592
Hmm.

35:36.802 --> 35:40.638
The boar put up more
of a fight than you.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.227
I see you're
making friends.

35:53.944 --> 35:56.195
What do you
want from me?

35:56.404 --> 35:58.989
What do you think
is gonna happen

35:59.199 --> 36:00.991
once we get
your friends back?

36:01.201 --> 36:03.285
For now, we have
a common goal,

36:03.495 --> 36:06.622
but one day,
this war is gonna end.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.207
What then?

36:08.416 --> 36:10.918
Just get
to the point.

36:11.128 --> 36:13.712
We know so little
about them.

36:13.922 --> 36:16.173
You've earned
their respect.

36:18.802 --> 36:21.720
I need you to be
my eyes and ears.

36:21.930 --> 36:24.431
You're asking me
to be a spy?

36:24.641 --> 36:27.268
I'm asking you

36:27.477 --> 36:31.522
to look out
for your people.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.941
I am.

36:55.422 --> 36:57.590
We're glad
you could make it.

36:57.799 --> 36:58.757
Thank you.

37:00.719 --> 37:01.844
Glad you could
make it.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.929
What the hell
is this?

37:04.139 --> 37:06.015
We're going to
the city of light.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.600
You're going now?

37:07.809 --> 37:09.727
There's a million ways
to die out there.

37:09.936 --> 37:13.814
Well, if it's not your time,
nothing can kill you,

37:14.024 --> 37:17.109
but if it is your time,
it only takes one.

37:17.319 --> 37:20.029
Right. You even
have a map?

37:20.238 --> 37:21.363
No.

37:21.573 --> 37:22.781
Then how do you know
where you're going?

37:22.991 --> 37:25.492
We don't, but I will not
be ruled by fear.

37:25.702 --> 37:27.077
You want to stop being
treated like a criminal,

37:27.287 --> 37:31.332
then you have to stop thinking
that that's all you are.

37:31.541 --> 37:34.793
Take this leap of faith
with me, John Murphy,

37:35.003 --> 37:36.879
and let me show you
there's so much more

37:37.088 --> 37:39.548
for you than this.

38:15.168 --> 38:17.628
It's OK.

38:17.837 --> 38:20.839
You're safe.

38:21.049 --> 38:24.593
How's your arm?
Hurts.

38:28.598 --> 38:29.932
We should go.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.184
That cage won't
hold forever.

38:32.394 --> 38:34.687
Wait.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.402
I was wrong
about you, Clarke.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.614
Your heart shows
no sign of weakness.

38:54.082 --> 38:56.792
The cage won't hold.

38:58.962 --> 39:01.547
I think I know how
to take Mount Weather.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.882
We've been trying
to get inside,

39:04.092 --> 39:05.551
but they've
already let us in.

39:05.760 --> 39:06.844
What are you
talking about?

39:07.053 --> 39:08.554
Your army
is already there

39:08.763 --> 39:10.139
locked in cages.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.557
We just need someone
on the inside

39:11.766 --> 39:13.600
to let them out.

39:13.810 --> 39:17.021
Bellamy. You have
faith in him?

39:17.230 --> 39:18.772
I do.

39:18.982 --> 39:20.983
I hope your faith
is well-placed

39:21.192 --> 39:23.902
because if he can't
get inside, we can't win.

39:24.112 --> 39:26.530
He will.

39:26.740 --> 39:29.575
Lexa, this
is gonna work.

39:29.784 --> 39:31.243
Come on.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.964
Stay back, or you
won't get your dose.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.933
First dose up.

40:00.607 --> 40:02.566
Next.

40:04.861 --> 40:06.945
Harvest.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.824
Next.

40:11.034 --> 40:12.826
Harvest.

40:18.375 --> 40:19.249
Next.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.587
Come on. Next.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.100
Let's move it.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.463
Harvest them all.

41:06.673 --> 41:08.882
Come on. Let's go.

41:11.594 --> 41:12.719
Uh!
