{\an8}and NICKELODEON

00:51.468 --> 00:52.343
Very good, then,
Principal Milton.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.471
Will do.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.639
See you first thing
in the morning, then.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.224
{\an8}Principal Milty?

00:58.308 --> 00:59.976
{\an8}Oh, no-- what'd I do?

01:00.059 --> 01:02.604
Milton and I
were simply discussing

01:02.687 --> 01:04.813
the particulars of my new job--

01:04.897 --> 01:07.609
(<i> voice slows and distorts</i> ):
teaching home economics

01:07.692 --> 01:09.152
at Lucky Junior High.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.278
(<i> gasps</i> )

01:15.408 --> 01:16.659
{\an1}Dodie, can you
talk to us?

01:16.743 --> 01:18.453
Could you tell us
what's wrong?

01:18.536 --> 01:20.413
(<i> whimpering</i> )

01:20.497 --> 01:23.792
{\an1}My... my mother
teaching full-time

01:23.875 --> 01:27.504
{\an8}at Lucky...
Junior High.

01:27.587 --> 01:30.298
{\an8}Got your thumb hooked
under my collar bone there.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.090
{\an8}Would you please release?

01:31.174 --> 01:33.885
Well, what's your
mom teaching, Dodie?

01:33.968 --> 01:35.678
{\an8}What's the difference?

01:35.762 --> 01:38.640
{\an8}My mom is not fit
to be around kids, Ginger.

01:38.723 --> 01:39.390
I can confirm that.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.683
Okay, okay.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.394
Let's just
play it out here.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.145
Worst-case scenario.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.856
Your mother gets
a job teaching...

01:46.940 --> 01:48.191
Home economics.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.069
{\an8}...home economics
at Lucky Junior High.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.403
{\an8}Okay, then what?

01:52.487 --> 01:55.990
She humiliates me by acting
like a total crab at school.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.325
Then what?

01:57.408 --> 01:58.326
All the cool kids

01:58.409 --> 01:59.869
who used to know me as nobody

01:59.953 --> 02:02.205
{\an5}now know me
as the daughter
of the total crab

02:02.288 --> 02:03.331
who teaches Home Ec.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.291
There-- is that so bad?

02:05.375 --> 02:06.584
Yes! Yes!

02:06.668 --> 02:08.461
A resounding yes!

02:08.544 --> 02:10.213
(<i> sighs in exasperation</i> )

02:15.134 --> 02:19.389
{\an5}SALESMAN:
Uh, anything
tickle your fancy, sir?

02:19.472 --> 02:22.976
Frankly, my fancy isn't all
that ticklish to begin with.

02:23.059 --> 02:24.769
Plus these stones are
downright unimpressive.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.729
Either the cut
lacks brilliance

02:26.813 --> 02:29.440
or the setting
is tasteless.

02:29.524 --> 02:32.235
How queer-- a discriminating
nine-year-old.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.070
I'm in my double digits,
thank you very much.

02:34.153 --> 02:38.241
Listen up, this ring is
for a very special lady--

02:38.324 --> 02:39.617
a very special lady--

02:39.701 --> 02:43.121
{\an1}so we're looking to be on
the high end of the low end,

02:43.204 --> 02:44.622
if you catch my drift.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.207
Indeed I do, sir.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.544
Might I suggest taking
a peek at our back room.

02:49.627 --> 02:53.214
It's where we house our
more exclusive collection.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.508
CARL:
Now you're talking.

02:55.592 --> 02:56.384
(<i> whistles</i> ):
This way, Dave-O.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.428
Right.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.764
BLAKE:
Carl Foutley.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.017
Carl Foutley.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.937
With our elementary years
quickly drawing to a close,

03:08.021 --> 03:12.275
why do I still find myself
haunted by those same two words?

03:12.358 --> 03:14.402
"Carl Foutley."

03:14.485 --> 03:17.322
I know one thing for sure.

03:17.405 --> 03:21.117
If I am to face
the corridors of junior high

03:21.200 --> 03:24.287
with one single scrap of
dignity,

03:24.370 --> 03:27.665
the score must be settled!

03:30.835 --> 03:32.545
Uh, hi there, Lois.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.881
You look lovely.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.884
Say, would you do me the honor
of becoming my wife?

03:37.967 --> 03:41.471
Uh... there is a ring involved.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.853
Okay, this is never
going to work.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.898
For starters, Mom's fingers
are a lot fatter than mine.

03:51.981 --> 03:52.732
This sucker barely fits me.

03:52.815 --> 03:53.858
(<i> grunting</i> )

03:53.942 --> 03:57.111
Oh, great-- it's stuck.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.655
Uh, relax your knuckle, Carl.

03:58.738 --> 03:59.489
Relax your... come on.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.158
Relax your knuckle, son,
do you hear me?

04:02.241 --> 04:02.492
(<i> grunting</i> )

04:02.575 --> 04:04.661
{\an1}CARL:
Ow!

04:04.744 --> 04:07.664
Will that be
cash or charge?

04:07.747 --> 04:10.208
I'm just saying
that's a small ring.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.376
{\an1}Never spaz, Dave--
I have a plan.

04:11.459 --> 04:15.338
It involves fried chicken
dinners, buttered popcorn

04:15.421 --> 04:18.800
{\an1}and this little baby slipping
right through my fingers.

04:18.882 --> 04:20.718
Then we get the ring resized

04:20.802 --> 04:23.221
{\an1}and you claim
the Momster as your bride.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.138
Yes.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.556
It's just that...

04:25.640 --> 04:29.852
well... there is one little step
between buying the ring

04:29.936 --> 04:31.688
and making the proposal.

04:31.771 --> 04:32.730
What's that?

04:32.814 --> 04:33.690
My mother.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.859
I'm afraid your mother
has to meet my mother.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.111
Afraid?

04:38.194 --> 04:41.239
Huh-- interesting
choice of words.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.203
Who's Josie?

04:47.286 --> 04:49.330
Everyone called me Josie
when I was a teenager.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.836
Well, maybe they didn't,
but I wanted them to.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.338
But you're not a teenager.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.549
J. Lo wears the cornrows,
doesn't she?

04:59.632 --> 05:01.217
I want to make sure
the Courtney Griplings

05:01.300 --> 05:04.971
and Miranda Killgallens
stand up and take notice.

05:05.054 --> 05:08.057
(<i> voice rising</i> ):
Take notice of what, Mother?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.308
Of Josie, of course.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.686
{\an1}It's never too late,
Deirdre Hortense.

05:11.769 --> 05:15.606
Uh, too late for what, Mother?

05:18.693 --> 05:20.570
Hey, nice-looking rock, bro.

05:20.653 --> 05:21.988
{\an1}Mind if I
take a gander?

05:22.071 --> 05:23.406
Be my guest.

05:23.489 --> 05:28.327
Ah, an emerald cut with
three supplementary baguettes--

05:28.411 --> 05:30.747
understated, yet elegant.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.415
I'm sure...

05:32.498 --> 05:35.251
{\an1}Ms. Sussman
will be delighted.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.336
Whoever said this
ring was for Noelle?

05:41.174 --> 05:48.431
(<i> eerie, echoing guffaws</i> )

05:48.514 --> 05:50.558
What's that
awful sound?

05:50.641 --> 05:53.853
{\an5}It sounds like
a middle-aged goat
being slaughtered.

05:53.936 --> 05:56.689
{\an1}Tortured
<i>and</i> slaughtered.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.649
(<i> eerie laughter continues</i> )

05:58.733 --> 06:00.777
DODIE:
No, girls, you're both wrong,

06:00.860 --> 06:04.489
for, you see, I'm afraid I know
exactly what that sound is.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.783
It is the infrequent,
yet highly irritating sound

06:06.866 --> 06:09.368
of my mother laughing.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.245
(<i> guffawing</i> )

06:11.329 --> 06:14.791
{\an4}Girlfriend,
if that Ian Richton
were any cuter,

06:14.874 --> 06:17.210
there'd be
a cover charge

06:17.293 --> 06:18.753
{\an5}to watch him
eat a burger
in the cafeteria.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.880
Okay?

06:20.963 --> 06:22.799
Can I get a high five?

06:22.882 --> 06:24.592
(<i> silence</i> )

06:24.675 --> 06:27.303
What's everybody laughing about?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.763
HTBT.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.640
HTBT?

06:30.723 --> 06:31.766
As in
"Had To Be There,"

06:31.849 --> 06:33.935
and you weren't.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.269
Shame.

06:35.353 --> 06:38.147
That Josie
is too much.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.942
Way too much.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.364
HTBT?

06:46.447 --> 06:47.865
She really said that?

06:47.949 --> 06:48.950
Wow! That's
messed up.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.660
Did you call her
on it, Dodie?

06:50.743 --> 06:52.745
Did you tell her
she hurt your feelings?

06:52.829 --> 06:55.665
Josie's doing a better job
of fitting in

06:55.748 --> 06:57.250
than I ever did.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.168
But in the end, he caved

06:59.252 --> 07:00.128
and let me use
that coupon

07:00.211 --> 07:03.381
even though it had
already expired.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.007
And that was dope,

07:05.091 --> 07:09.095
because trash bags can be
mighty expensive, girlfriend.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.763
High five on that?

07:10.847 --> 07:12.515
(<i> others laughing</i> )

07:12.598 --> 07:13.891
{\an1}I'm not
so sure, Dodie.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.602
{\an1}Kind of looks like
they're laughing <i> at</i> her

07:16.686 --> 07:18.187
and not <i> with</i> her.

07:18.271 --> 07:18.980
Maybe my mom was
a Courtney

07:19.063 --> 07:21.357
back when
she was my age.

07:21.440 --> 07:25.069
Maybe those girls sense
the popularity gene...

07:25.153 --> 07:27.572
dormant, but
alive within her.

07:27.655 --> 07:30.408
{\an1}I'm not certain
she's with us anymore.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.577
{\an1}I could learn
a lot from her.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.787
(<i> Ginger groans</i> )

07:43.462 --> 07:46.549
Noelle, forgive
the preamble,

07:46.632 --> 07:50.052
{\an5}but I'd like to say
that I deliver this
unfortunate news

07:50.136 --> 07:53.181
with the best
of intentions.

07:53.264 --> 07:56.601
You know I've always
been quite fond of you.

07:56.684 --> 07:57.560
Yeah, right.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.103
That's why when I went to Lucky,

07:59.187 --> 08:00.605
you invited every single kid

08:00.688 --> 08:02.523
to your birthday parties
except for me.

08:02.607 --> 08:06.027
Oh... oh, Noelle,
that was an oversight--

08:06.110 --> 08:09.488
an annual oversight.

08:09.572 --> 08:09.739
Whatever.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.074
Right.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.576
Let's see, then.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.581
(<i> gasps</i> )

08:18.664 --> 08:20.374
Do you know
this creature?

08:20.458 --> 08:21.083
Do I?

08:21.167 --> 08:25.087
That's Polly Schuster--
part bird

08:25.171 --> 08:26.505
and part snake.

08:26.589 --> 08:26.923
Yes.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.424
As you can see,

08:28.507 --> 08:32.303
your boyfriend Carl is
rather cozy with her.

08:32.385 --> 08:36.140
The last thing I want to do is
come between the two of you,

08:36.224 --> 08:38.392
but I'm afraid there's more.

08:38.476 --> 08:39.477
You see,
just hours ago,

08:39.559 --> 08:44.315
{\an5}he was seen sporting
a quality diamond
engagement ring.

08:44.398 --> 08:47.068
He told me in
no uncertain terms

08:47.151 --> 08:50.112
that it was
not for you.

08:50.196 --> 08:53.324
You... you think it's...
for Polly?

08:53.407 --> 08:54.992
That remains
my firm belief, yes.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.578
Double-crosser.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.413
My deepest condolences
are with you, Noelle,

08:59.497 --> 09:02.667
for what I am sure is
your darkest hour.

09:02.750 --> 09:03.626
Oh!

09:03.709 --> 09:07.046
I suggest you dump him
before he dumps you.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.714
No one is dumping anyone.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.342
It ain't over
till it's over, Gripling.

09:11.425 --> 09:11.968
Just remember that!

09:12.051 --> 09:15.137
I find your pigheadedness

09:15.221 --> 09:17.682
both heartwarming
and pathetic all at once.

09:27.191 --> 09:29.735
Dr. Dave, there's
a fibroid in room 213

09:29.819 --> 09:31.487
with your name
on it.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.823
{\an5}So it's really okay
to have my mother
over for dinner?

09:33.906 --> 09:36.951
{\an4}I mean, I've been wanting
the two of you to meet
for some time now.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.120
Absolutely.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.162
{\an1}I'd love to meet the mother
behind the doctor.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.498
{\an1}She competes
for blood supply,

09:42.581 --> 09:47.169
{\an1}and in doing so, sucks
the life out of her host.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.254
Who does--
your mother?

09:48.337 --> 09:50.589
(<i> giggles nervously</i> )

09:50.673 --> 09:52.842
{\an1}No, silly,
the fibroid in room 213.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.510
Oh.

09:54.593 --> 09:56.012
Thank goodness.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.222
You scared me there
for a minute.

DODIE:
Mother, slow down.

10:37.636 --> 10:39.221
Aren't you going to give me

10:39.305 --> 10:40.139
a ride home?

10:40.222 --> 10:42.183
Don't you "Mom" me
in front of our peeps.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.477
And I'm not going home.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.936
Tell your father
to start dinner.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.939
I'm going with Miranda
to her clarinet lesson,

10:49.023 --> 10:51.192
and then I have
to swing by Mipsy's

10:51.275 --> 10:53.527
to help deep-condition her hair.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.948
{\an5}GINGER:
<i>Maybe Dodie's finally</i>
<i>starting to come around.</i>

10:58.032 --> 10:59.867
<i>She looked angry</i>
<i>after school today</i>

10:59.950 --> 11:01.619
<i>when her mom blew her off,</i>
<i>and she should be.</i>

11:01.702 --> 11:04.872
<i>With all due respect</i>
<i>to JoAnn Bishop,</i>

11:04.955 --> 11:06.540
<i>her alter ego Josie</i>
<i>is a backstabbing,</i>

11:06.624 --> 11:09.543
<i>social-climbing,</i>
<i>popularity-obsessed wannabe.</i>

11:09.627 --> 11:11.670
<i>And for as much</i>
<i>as I love Dodie,</i>

11:11.754 --> 11:16.008
<i>I think she has the potential</i>
<i>to be a Josie</i>

11:16.092 --> 11:18.344
<i>if she doesn't watch it.</i>

11:19.887 --> 11:22.848
{\an4}MAN:
And then you add
some water, and see?

11:22.932 --> 11:26.519
{\an1}All the beautiful little mashed
potatoes appear like magic.

11:26.602 --> 11:30.481
Ha! It's fun when
you make dinner, Dad.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.108
Don't tell that
to your mother.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.859
You know how
she feels about fun.

11:33.943 --> 11:34.402
(<i> Dodie sighs loudly</i> )

11:34.485 --> 11:36.612
What's wrong, pumpkin?

11:36.695 --> 11:39.490
{\an1}Dad, Mom must have been,
like, a total popularity queen

11:39.573 --> 11:41.325
{\an1}in middle school
or something,

11:41.409 --> 11:42.785
{\an1}because she attached herself
to the cool girls

11:42.868 --> 11:46.789
{\an1}and she's treating me like
she doesn't even know who I am.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.707
Let me show you something,
Dodie.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.090
{\an3}There.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.716
That's Josie.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.718
Miss Popularity?

11:59.802 --> 12:00.678
That's Mom?

12:00.761 --> 12:02.096
{\an1}That's Josie
McDonald.

12:02.179 --> 12:05.391
{\an4}She was the most
popular girl in
our middle school.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.226
Here's your mother:

12:07.309 --> 12:08.978
"Missed Popularity."

12:09.061 --> 12:10.396
(<i> giggles</i> )

12:10.479 --> 12:12.565
{\an1}She looks just
like you, Dodie.

12:12.648 --> 12:13.732
{\an3}Yeah.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.527
Mother was obsessed
with the cool crowd,

12:16.610 --> 12:17.736
with fitting in,
being popular,

12:17.820 --> 12:21.198
{\an4}and sometimes she
did things that
weren't so nice

12:21.282 --> 12:23.659
just to achieve that.

12:23.742 --> 12:24.785
Like what, Dad?

12:24.869 --> 12:26.287
That's not important.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.204
But my point is this:

12:27.288 --> 12:29.957
Let your mother's lunacy
be a lesson to you.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.209
If you don't learn
to accept yourself now,

12:32.293 --> 12:34.879
you may never learn
to accept yourself at all.

12:34.962 --> 12:37.006
And if you don't
accept yourself,

12:37.089 --> 12:39.717
{\an1}how will you ever be
accepted into college?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.719
That's a good point,
Robert.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.889
That's a very good point
you just made.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.563
Oh, what is taking Mother
so long?

12:52.646 --> 12:54.023
She can't be lost.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.275
My directions
were explicit.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.902
Dave, doctor, buddy--
calm down.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.029
You're going to blow
the whole operation.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.113
Why are you...

13:01.197 --> 13:02.990
{\an1}The ring, Carl--
the ring.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.575
We can't let our mother see it.

13:04.658 --> 13:05.993
Man, you are way
too high strung.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.536
{\an5}Did you ever think
of prescribing
yourself something?

13:07.620 --> 13:10.206
I'm not usually
like this, Carl.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.081
I just grossly
underestimated

13:11.165 --> 13:13.751
{\an5}how nervous
this situation
would make me.

13:13.834 --> 13:14.293
(<i> doorbell rings</i> )

13:14.376 --> 13:16.545
(<i> Dave gasps</i> )

13:18.339 --> 13:21.091
Ladies, to what do
I owe this honor?

13:21.175 --> 13:23.177
Greetings,
and excuse us.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.637
We're here to see Ginger.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.264
(<i> Noelle groaning</i> )

13:27.348 --> 13:30.559
I trusted you, Carl.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.978
I trusted you.

13:33.062 --> 13:37.942
{\an5}BLAKE:
Ah, you are
a malleable one, Sussman.

13:38.025 --> 13:40.194
You can thank me later, Foutley,

13:40.277 --> 13:43.239
for destroying your relationship
with Noelle!

13:43.322 --> 13:45.074
(<i> laughs evilly</i> )

13:52.623 --> 13:55.668
{\an5}MRS. DAVE:
Not much to look at
from the outside.

13:56.418 --> 13:57.419
Ditto for the inside.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.213
Mother, it's
so good to...

13:59.296 --> 14:01.549
Your hair's too long,

14:01.632 --> 14:03.092
your shirt's
too small,

14:03.175 --> 14:06.262
{\an5}and I see
a cavity forming
on that back molar.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.180
Lay off the sweets.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.062
Greetings, Ginger.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.442
What are you guys doing here?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.987
We're here on urgent business
regarding Dodie Bishop's mother.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.072
Josie!

14:25.155 --> 14:28.325
It's, like, who does
she think she is?

14:28.409 --> 14:31.370
She's attached herself
to our crew

14:31.453 --> 14:34.081
and we find it <i> très</i> annoying.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.207
(<i> all repeating</i> "très"<i> )</i>

14:35.291 --> 14:37.376
{\an1}Very <i> très.</i>

14:37.459 --> 14:39.878
I know, but Dodie
has convinced herself

14:39.962 --> 14:41.005
that her mom is cool

14:41.088 --> 14:43.465
and that you guys like
hanging with her.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.508
Cool?

14:44.592 --> 14:46.010
I should say not.

14:46.093 --> 14:50.180
I can't even say she's the
opposite of cool, which is hot,

14:50.264 --> 14:52.516
which she is not.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.310
No, no, no, no, no.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.811
Look, you guys.

14:55.894 --> 14:58.647
I think Dodie needs to hear this
with her own ears.

14:58.731 --> 14:58.981
Do you mind?

15:02.109 --> 15:06.697
{\an5}Typically, when
our group makes
a secondary house call,

15:06.780 --> 15:08.407
we not only bill
for the house call,

15:08.490 --> 15:10.451
but also for
the travel time.

15:10.534 --> 15:11.493
But it's the only way

15:11.577 --> 15:13.871
to get Josie
out of your hair.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.205
COURTNEY:
Done.

15:16.957 --> 15:20.628
{\an5}I reckon
housekeeping duties
fall by the wayside

15:20.711 --> 15:22.588
when you're
a working mom.

15:22.671 --> 15:25.007
Yeah, well, you're
more than welcome

15:25.090 --> 15:29.053
{\an4}to drag a mop
across the floor
there, Grandma.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.346
Oh, hi,
Mrs. Dave.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.014
I'm Ginger,
Lois's daughter.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.224
Looking forward
to dining with you

15:34.308 --> 15:34.892
in the very
near future.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.644
Fried chicken,
I understand,

15:36.727 --> 15:39.188
for the health-
conscious.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.606
Mom's is the best.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.775
From the looks of her,
I don't doubt it.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.610
{\an1}Mom, can I please,
please, please

15:44.693 --> 15:46.362
{\an1}run out to Dodie's
for a minute?

15:46.445 --> 15:47.655
I wouldn't ask

15:47.738 --> 15:49.698
{\an1}unless it was really
important, which it is.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.824
Take me with you.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.534
(<i> Dave laughing hysterically</i> )

15:52.618 --> 15:54.328
{\an1}Oh, she's just
kidding, Mother.

15:54.411 --> 15:55.537
She's kidding.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.373
{\an1}She kids so often--
she really does.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.332
{\an1}Big kidder-- kiddy,
kiddy, kidder.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.292
The kidmeister.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.377
{\an1}You know, they call
her that at work.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.879
No, they don't.

16:04.755 --> 16:05.714
Thanks, Mom.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.757
I'll be back ASAP.

16:06.840 --> 16:07.716
{\an1}Later.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.759
{\an3}"Later"?

16:08.842 --> 16:10.761
I reckon
proper manners

16:10.844 --> 16:12.554
must also fall
by the wayside

16:12.638 --> 16:15.182
when you're
a working mom.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.356
Should I ring the bell?

16:22.439 --> 16:23.607
No!

16:23.691 --> 16:24.650
Then we'll have
to deal with Josie.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.444
{\an1}Let's toss a pebble
at her window,

16:27.528 --> 16:29.363
{\an1}like they do
in the movies.

16:29.738 --> 16:30.406
Here, let me.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.908
No, no, no--
I can do it.

16:32.991 --> 16:35.202
(<i> pebble ricochets off window</i> )

16:35.285 --> 16:35.536
{\an1}Ow!

16:35.619 --> 16:36.578
Oh, my eye!

16:36.662 --> 16:39.957
Shh! Josie might
hear you.

16:40.040 --> 16:40.749
But it's bleeding.

16:40.833 --> 16:44.586
That was positively
exhilarating.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.046
Let's have another go.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.092
(<i> pebble taps window</i> )

(<i> inaudible</i> )

16:58.016 --> 16:58.308
The popular girls!

16:58.392 --> 17:00.352
The A-list.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.479
They're all right there
on my lawn.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.021
This is it!

17:05.065 --> 17:08.777
Do not vie for their
acceptance, Dodie.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.574
Do not be a Josie.

17:13.656 --> 17:15.659
For if you don't learn
to accept yourself now...

17:15.742 --> 17:19.621
{\an5}HOODSEY (<i> in distance</i> ):
How are you ever going to get
accepted into college!

17:19.704 --> 17:20.873
That's right.

17:20.955 --> 17:21.999
(<i> sighs</i> )

17:22.082 --> 17:23.459
That's exactly right.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.294
Hello, Ginger.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.296
Courtney, Miranda.

17:27.378 --> 17:28.797
Mipsy, Missy, Mindy,
Traci, Stacey,

17:28.881 --> 17:30.841
Casey, Donna, Diva,
Dina and Hope.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.218
Nice to see you all.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.303
I do my homework

17:34.386 --> 17:37.431
in an oversized
"Farewell Froggy" T-shirt

17:37.514 --> 17:39.057
and stripey leggings.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.559
Now you know.

17:40.642 --> 17:41.810
Yes.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.353
Dodie, I brought
these girls over here

17:43.437 --> 17:45.272
because...

17:45.355 --> 17:46.940
{\an1}Let me cut
right to the chase.

17:47.024 --> 17:50.235
It's getting late and Mipsy
needs to be seen by a doctor.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.988
Now, Ginger has told me that you
are under the false impression

17:53.071 --> 17:56.450
that we girls enjoy
hanging with your mother.

17:56.533 --> 17:57.785
And we don't.

17:57.868 --> 17:58.619
No.

17:58.702 --> 17:59.828
{\an1}We don't appreciate
her trying

17:59.912 --> 18:02.831
{\an1}to "walk the walk,
talk the talk,"

18:02.915 --> 18:03.832
or pull off wearing
a frayed jean skirt

18:03.916 --> 18:06.460
when she's clearly in her 40s.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.211
(<i> group cackles</i> )

18:07.294 --> 18:09.254
Oh, wow.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.339
{\an1}You see,
Dodie?

18:10.422 --> 18:12.090
They don't think
your mom is cool.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.091
That's fine.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.593
My mother doesn't need
to be cool.

18:14.676 --> 18:15.511
And neither
do I.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.513
Is that all?

18:17.596 --> 18:18.514
Basically.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.225
{\an1}Can we
go now?

18:21.558 --> 18:23.227
Dodie, wait.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.186
Are you okay?

18:24.269 --> 18:26.355
I'm more than
okay, Ginger.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.774
I confronted
the popular girls

18:28.857 --> 18:30.692
and I stood my ground.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.945
Now I just have
to confront my mother.

18:33.028 --> 18:36.698
{\an1}Oh, you're one
brave girl, Bishop.

18:36.782 --> 18:37.866
Oh, I got to run

18:37.950 --> 18:41.161
{\an1}before I get in trouble
with <i> my</i> mother.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.461
{\an5}Drop my "Popular
in Peach" nail
color, Mother.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.879
This is
an intervention.

18:50.963 --> 18:51.672
What?

18:51.755 --> 18:52.548
You're not Josie McDonald,

18:52.631 --> 18:55.050
and you're <i> not</i> cool.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.885
And I'm not cool either!

18:56.969 --> 18:58.220
How do you know about her?

18:58.303 --> 19:00.848
{\an5}Dad showed me your
junior high school
yearbook.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.308
Do you really think
those popular girls

19:03.392 --> 19:04.560
are better
than we are?

19:04.643 --> 19:05.769
Because I don't.

19:05.853 --> 19:06.895
Not anymore.

19:06.979 --> 19:07.813
{\an1}I, uh...

19:07.896 --> 19:10.107
{\an1}I guess sometimes
girls like us,

19:10.190 --> 19:13.902
{\an4}we... we get
so wrapped up in
wanting to be liked,

19:13.986 --> 19:16.280
{\an4}that, uh...
well, we forget
to like ourselves.

19:16.363 --> 19:20.242
{\an4}And I suppose
that's what's most
important after all.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.160
{\an1}So let's try to remember
that, shall we?

19:22.244 --> 19:23.036
Both of us.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.788
There's something
else important

19:24.872 --> 19:26.123
to remember, Mom.

19:26.206 --> 19:26.957
Where teenagers
are concerned,

19:27.040 --> 19:30.085
the best rule is this:
One per household,

19:30.168 --> 19:31.503
and I've pretty much
got it covered.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.630
Yes, I see that.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.382
Thanks for being so
understanding, Mom.

19:35.465 --> 19:38.260
{\an5}We should have
mother-daughter talks
like this more often.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.096
I did it!

19:41.179 --> 19:42.723
I did!

19:42.806 --> 19:44.766
I had an open, honest
conversation with my mother.

19:44.850 --> 19:45.767
I didn't back down

19:45.851 --> 19:48.186
and she didn't yell at me.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.438
Major milestone.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.398
This could be the start
of something good.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.275
{\an4}JoANN:
Oh, for goodness
sake, Deirdre.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.818
{\an1}Turn down the volume
on that mouthpiece of yours.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.112
{\an1}I can barely
hear myself think.

19:57.195 --> 19:59.948
Oh, well-- at least
she's back to normal...

20:00.032 --> 20:01.742
whatever that means.

20:01.825 --> 20:05.829
Frankly, it's
a little pinkish for poultry.

20:05.913 --> 20:09.082
Can I butter
your biscuit for you?

20:09.166 --> 20:10.000
CARL:
Mom!

20:10.083 --> 20:12.628
{\an5}GINGER:
Sorry I'm late,
everyone.

20:12.711 --> 20:13.962
Whew, I'm starved.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.464
Well, mission
accomplished,

20:15.547 --> 20:16.548
you'll be glad to know.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.674
Really?

20:17.758 --> 20:19.051
What mission is
that, Ginger?

20:19.134 --> 20:20.260
Well, it's like this.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.804
{\an1}Dodie's Mom was totally
embarrassing her at school

20:22.888 --> 20:24.890
but Dodie, who has never
confronted her mom

20:24.973 --> 20:27.267
about anything, tried
to just convince herself

20:27.351 --> 20:28.685
that it was a good thing,

20:28.769 --> 20:30.646
even though her mom
was being really rude

20:30.729 --> 20:31.521
and hurting her feelings.

20:31.605 --> 20:34.232
Mmm, this is really
good chicken, Mom.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.859
Thank you, Ginger,
but please,

20:35.943 --> 20:38.195
go on with the story
of the interfering mother

20:38.278 --> 20:40.447
{\an5}who nearly
sabotaged her own
child's happiness.

20:42.908 --> 20:43.951
Oh, right.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.160
Well, the good news is,

20:45.243 --> 20:46.620
tonight Dodie finally
mustered the courage

20:46.703 --> 20:48.789
to talk to her mom

20:48.872 --> 20:50.749
about the things
that were bothering her.

20:50.832 --> 20:51.833
And it's about time.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.835
I mean, we're almost
high school freshmen, you know.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.463
High school freshmen, indeed.

20:56.546 --> 20:57.881
Now, listen here, Mother...

20:57.965 --> 20:59.049
{\an1}GINGER:
Something's burning.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.676
LOIS:
Oh, holy cannoli.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.470
(<i> coughing</i> )

21:07.265 --> 21:10.519
(<i> making strange karate yells</i> )

21:10.602 --> 21:11.561
{\an1}Noelle.

21:11.645 --> 21:12.104
Honey, baby.

21:12.187 --> 21:14.356
What are you doing here?

21:14.439 --> 21:17.401
Is this the big
engagement dinner

21:17.484 --> 21:20.362
where you ask her
to marry you?

21:20.445 --> 21:21.446
Well, is it?

21:21.530 --> 21:22.572
Really good chicken,
Ms. Foutley.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.533
Thank you.

21:24.616 --> 21:25.242
Now, what are you
talking about?

21:25.325 --> 21:28.078
Don't bother trying
to deceive me.

21:28.161 --> 21:29.955
Gripling told me
everything.

21:30.038 --> 21:32.374
I know about the lies,
about the love,

21:32.457 --> 21:35.836
about the diamond
engagement ring.

21:35.919 --> 21:38.505
ALL:
What diamond engagement ring?

21:39.840 --> 21:42.884
(<i> making karate yells</i> )

21:42.968 --> 21:44.344
I bought that ring.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.387
And I can explain.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.847
Explain why
you bought my son

21:46.930 --> 21:48.890
a diamond
engagement ring?

21:48.974 --> 21:50.017
You'd better!

21:50.100 --> 21:51.101
Oh, well... the...

21:51.184 --> 21:53.186
the ring is not
for Carl, Lois.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.563
It's...
(<i> clears throat</i> )

21:54.646 --> 21:57.190
It's for you.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.442
MRS. DAVE:
David!

21:58.525 --> 21:59.735
I bought that ring

21:59.818 --> 22:02.446
so that I could
propose to you, Lois.

22:02.529 --> 22:05.866
But I was afraid of what
my mother would say

22:05.949 --> 22:08.577
and that's why I wanted
her to meet you first.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.203
I'll tell you
what I'd say.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.246
Mother, please.

22:11.329 --> 22:14.249
I love this woman,
and her children,

22:14.332 --> 22:15.792
and her burnt buns.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.252
And so, Lois,

22:17.336 --> 22:18.962
when I pry that ring
off your son's finger

22:19.046 --> 22:22.424
and have it cleaned
and resized...

22:23.550 --> 22:25.010
will you marry me?

22:25.093 --> 22:26.011
Oh, Dr. Dave.

22:26.094 --> 22:28.889
(<i> makes karate noises</i> )

22:29.723 --> 22:30.849
I... I think.

22:30.932 --> 22:33.268
{\an1}If it's all
the same, I'd...
