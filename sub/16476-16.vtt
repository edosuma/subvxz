WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:03.530
<i>Almost to altitude.</i>

00:03.540 --> 00:05.040
Three minutes to jump.

00:05.040 --> 00:07.840
We're all good!
Looking forward to this, Walt.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.540
Yeah, whoo!

00:09.540 --> 00:11.580
12,000 feet!

00:11.580 --> 00:12.780
You guys pumped?!

00:12.780 --> 00:13.940
I am so pumped, governor!

00:13.950 --> 00:15.350
Ha-ha!

00:15.350 --> 00:17.080
I just wanted all of you

00:17.080 --> 00:18.720
to experience
this thrill with me.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.480
Because I know,

00:20.490 --> 00:24.620
the next few weeks,
it might feel like a free fall.

00:24.620 --> 00:26.720
But we're gonna get
through it, okay?

00:26.730 --> 00:28.430
And why is that?
One minute to jump.

00:28.430 --> 00:30.160
Because we're a team.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.159
No, we're family.

00:32.159 --> 00:33.700
And that's what families do.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.430
Families stick together.
Am I right?

00:35.430 --> 00:37.230
Right! Yes, sir!
Am I right?

00:37.240 --> 00:38.940
Yes, sir! Yes!

00:38.940 --> 00:40.640
Do you know when
it's gonna happen, sir?

00:40.640 --> 00:42.210
Ronnie thinks
it's gonna come out

00:42.210 --> 00:43.270
in the next few days.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.510
Here we go! All right! Whoo!

00:45.510 --> 00:47.580
Governor Whitfield,
you'll be up first,

00:47.580 --> 00:48.850
and I'll be right behind you.

00:48.850 --> 00:51.180
See you on the ground, governor.

00:51.180 --> 00:53.880
Ha-ha! Geronimo!

01:00.490 --> 01:02.760
Yeah!

01:07.700 --> 01:09.100
Help! Help me!

01:09.100 --> 01:10.870
Help me!

01:10.870 --> 01:12.170
I can't let this happen!

01:12.170 --> 01:13.500
Help!

01:13.510 --> 01:15.270
Help me!

01:15.940 --> 01:17.610
Help me! Help me!

01:17.610 --> 01:18.780
I got you! I got you!

01:18.780 --> 01:20.940
Help me!
I got you!

01:20.950 --> 01:22.150
Just hold on!

01:24.250 --> 01:26.720
Governor Whitfield was
an experienced skydiver,

01:26.720 --> 01:28.420
having jumped
several dozen times.

01:28.420 --> 01:30.320
The FAA recently concluded
that the governor's

01:30.320 --> 01:33.820
primary and reserve parachutes
both malfunctioned.

01:33.830 --> 01:36.960
Walter Hyland,
owner of Hyland skydiving,

01:36.960 --> 01:40.060
apparently died heroically
while attempting to rescue him.

01:40.070 --> 01:42.970
The dive was supposed to be
a team-building exercise

01:42.970 --> 01:44.800
with his chief of staff
Travis Robbins,

01:44.800 --> 01:46.470
treasurer Avery Tottenham,

01:46.470 --> 01:48.270
and lieutenant governor
Garrett Aiken,

01:48.270 --> 01:50.610
who has since been sworn in
as governor of Connecticut.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.580
Now, five months
after the accident,

01:52.580 --> 01:55.380
jury selection begins
in the wrongful-death lawsuit

01:55.380 --> 01:58.380
filed by the late governor's
widow, Addison Whitfield,

01:58.380 --> 01:59.750
against the skydiving company.

01:59.750 --> 02:02.650
This lawsuit is not about
the money.

02:02.650 --> 02:06.020
I'm doing this for my husband,
who deserves justice.

02:08.830 --> 02:11.600
Mrs. Whitfield just wants
Hyland skydiving to be

02:11.600 --> 02:13.830
held responsible for
her husband's death

02:13.830 --> 02:17.070
so a tragedy like this
never happens to anyone else.

02:17.070 --> 02:19.100
Our girl Liberty is
moving up in the world.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.340
I feel like a proud parent.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.370
Bigger cases beget bigger cases.

02:22.370 --> 02:24.070
I was thinking
maybe we should let her

02:24.080 --> 02:25.410
spread her wings on this one.

02:25.410 --> 02:26.440
Okay.

02:26.450 --> 02:28.040
But she doesn't need us.

02:28.050 --> 02:30.010
A skydiving company
should give their clients

02:30.020 --> 02:31.820
parachutes that, you know, open.

02:31.820 --> 02:33.550
It's no slam dunk.

02:33.550 --> 02:35.390
The governor signed
a liability waiver.

02:35.390 --> 02:36.820
Yeah, and the waiver
can be broken

02:36.820 --> 02:38.560
if Liberty proves
either gross negligence

02:38.560 --> 02:39.660
or willful misconduct.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.020
We both know how clever she is.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.530
She'll be able
to get past the waiver.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.990
Not worried about Liberty.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.630
Well, then, why would
she need our help?

02:45.630 --> 02:47.860
She doesn't.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.500
Wait, we're not joining
Liberty's team, are we?

02:51.500 --> 02:53.970
No... you're actually considering
going up against her?

02:53.970 --> 02:56.110
Yeah.
Well, uh...

02:57.780 --> 02:59.810
<i>The owner
of the company, Walt Hyland,</i>

02:59.810 --> 03:01.780
died in the accident,
and his daughter Dylan

03:01.780 --> 03:05.320
and his brother Max
run this company now.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.820
What do you think she'll say?

03:06.820 --> 03:08.890
The daughter?
No, Liberty.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.220
You do realize we're not
her parents, right?

03:12.220 --> 03:14.760
I just don't want her
to feel blindsided by us.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.530
Didn't you just say
that we should

03:16.530 --> 03:17.890
let her spread her wings?

03:17.900 --> 03:19.630
Why this case, Bull?

03:19.630 --> 03:22.030
I mean, the governor's widow
has the public behind her,

03:22.030 --> 03:24.400
not to mention the courts and
a lot of money and resources.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.440
I'd say it's time
to level the playing field.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.670
So there it is.

03:27.670 --> 03:31.880
You think this is Goliath
picking on David again.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.140
All I know is
a skydiving company

03:34.150 --> 03:36.310
with a 27-year
spotless safety record

03:36.320 --> 03:38.420
becomes a national
villain overnight.

03:38.420 --> 03:40.850
I'm intrigued,
and a little hungry.

03:40.850 --> 03:43.250
We should have stopped
at that barbecue joint.

03:43.260 --> 03:46.220
Sometimes in David
versus Goliath,

03:46.230 --> 03:48.090
David deserves to lose.

03:48.090 --> 03:50.090
I'll call the author
of the Bible

03:50.100 --> 03:53.760
and tell him you have a few
notes on one of his stories.

03:53.770 --> 03:56.500
Thanks for calling.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.800
Uh, hi. Uh, can I help you?

03:58.800 --> 03:59.970
Hi. I'm Dr. Jason Bull.

03:59.970 --> 04:02.270
This is my colleague
Marissa Morgan.

04:02.270 --> 04:03.240
We left a message.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.810
I'm sorry you came all this way,

04:04.810 --> 04:07.580
but we can't afford to
bring on a trial consultant.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.450
As you can see,
business isn't exactly

04:09.450 --> 04:10.580
booming at the moment.

04:10.580 --> 04:12.520
Before the accident,
we had 24 employees.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.650
Now we only have six.

04:13.650 --> 04:14.650
We understand.

04:14.650 --> 04:16.190
Just want to hear
your side of the story.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.560
Okay, sure.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.290
Oh, this is my uncle Max.

04:20.290 --> 04:23.660
Max, this is Marissa Morgan
and Dr. Jason Bull.

04:23.660 --> 04:28.000
Did Dylan mention that
we can't afford your services?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.630
She did.
And we're still here.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.300
Max handles
our business affairs.

04:32.300 --> 04:33.970
He's also been
a real lifesaver for me,

04:33.970 --> 04:35.210
after dad died.

04:35.210 --> 04:36.470
As in-house counsel,

04:36.480 --> 04:39.380
I'll be representing us
at the trial.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.680
Didn't the insurance company

04:40.680 --> 04:42.380
assign an attorney
to litigate the case?

04:42.380 --> 04:44.110
Well, they're
expecting us to admit fault,

04:44.120 --> 04:45.820
which would destroy
my dad's legacy.

04:45.820 --> 04:48.350
Even if we did admit fault,

04:48.350 --> 04:50.190
the insurance won't
cover the settlement.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.990
It'll bankrupt us.

04:51.990 --> 04:53.960
Why is the governor's widow
doing this?

04:53.960 --> 04:58.160
My dad gave his life
trying to save her husband.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.960
She needs someone to blame.

04:59.970 --> 05:01.770
So whose fault was it?

05:01.770 --> 05:05.700
The FAA ruled that
both parachute cords snapped

05:05.700 --> 05:07.070
due to wear and tear.

05:07.070 --> 05:08.240
That's impossible.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.910
My dad double-checked
every pack before each jump.

05:10.910 --> 05:14.610
He would have easily noticed
if those cords were worn.

05:14.610 --> 05:17.510
My dad never would have
made that mistake.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.320
Did your father have
a separate office?

05:21.320 --> 05:23.150
Yes.

05:23.160 --> 05:26.160
Can you show it to me?

05:28.430 --> 05:29.990
Hey. You gonna be long?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.830
I just got to scan
a couple things.

05:31.830 --> 05:34.200
Uh, no. Done.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.470
It's all yours, chunk.

05:35.470 --> 05:36.930
Thanks.

05:36.940 --> 05:38.130
Hey, Benny.

05:39.340 --> 05:43.240
Who's Hayden Watkins?

05:46.310 --> 05:49.180
Someone I prosecuted
a long time ago.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.950
You look exactly the same.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.820
Not on the inside.

05:56.820 --> 06:00.890
So, Hayden Watkins... bad guy?

06:00.890 --> 06:03.730
Yeah, bad guy.

06:07.030 --> 06:08.260
This is you.

06:08.270 --> 06:11.370
Telluride.
Four years ago.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.640
I was training for the X games.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.340
Wow.

06:15.340 --> 06:16.810
You're the real deal, huh?

06:16.810 --> 06:18.980
I used to be, I guess.

06:18.980 --> 06:21.410
Haven't been able to do
much of anything since...

06:21.410 --> 06:24.880
You know, the accident.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.080
I haven't even been able
to jump with our clients.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.190
How's that make you feel?

06:32.190 --> 06:34.090
Out there.

06:34.090 --> 06:36.690
Competing in the X games?

06:36.700 --> 06:39.330
Fearlessness.

06:39.330 --> 06:41.460
Is there such a thing?

06:41.470 --> 06:43.530
Of course.

06:47.910 --> 06:50.470
If anyone was fearless,
it was my dad.

06:50.480 --> 06:52.910
He was the real deal.

06:52.910 --> 06:55.480
People used to tell me
I was just like him.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.980
But lately I've been
nothing but afraid.

06:57.980 --> 06:59.980
Afraid of losing
the company he built.

06:59.990 --> 07:03.090
Afraid of not being able
to restore his name.

07:06.630 --> 07:08.290
Is there anything
else I can show you,

07:08.290 --> 07:10.590
Dr. Bull?

07:10.600 --> 07:12.960
No, this is great.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.100
Thank you, Dylan.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.930
<i>Her father was meticulous.</i>

07:15.930 --> 07:17.400
Had an engineer's mindset.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.770
Believed in redundancy...
two sets of keys,

07:19.770 --> 07:21.940
two calendars, both filled out.

07:21.940 --> 07:23.740
Somebody like that
doesn't forget

07:23.740 --> 07:26.110
to check parachutes
multiple times.

07:26.110 --> 07:27.480
Well, it doesn't matter.

07:27.480 --> 07:30.050
Both parachutes
still malfunctioned,

07:30.050 --> 07:32.350
so even if he did check them,
he's still at fault

07:32.350 --> 07:34.020
for not discovering
that the cords were worn

07:34.020 --> 07:35.490
and about to break.

07:35.490 --> 07:37.520
That's gross negligence,
which is all Liberty needs

07:37.520 --> 07:39.360
to get around the waiver.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.590
Unless...

07:41.590 --> 07:44.790
You don't need to pause
for dramatic effect.

07:44.800 --> 07:48.130
Unless, when Walt
checked those parachutes,

07:48.130 --> 07:49.700
they were in perfect condition.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.530
But, then, why did they break?

07:51.540 --> 07:52.770
A popular U.S. governor died.

07:52.770 --> 07:54.340
Maybe he wasn't popular
with everyone.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.210
Bull...

07:56.210 --> 07:58.173
It wasn't gross negligence.
Walt didn't make a mistake.

07:58.180 --> 08:00.610
He followed the same
procedure he had for years.

08:00.610 --> 08:01.880
And if that's the case,

08:01.880 --> 08:04.480
somebody sabotaged
the governor's parachutes.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:16.350 --> 08:18.030
Wait, so who are we
pointing the finger at?

08:18.580 --> 08:19.850
Danny's investigating everyone

08:19.850 --> 08:21.850
who had access
to the governor's parachutes.

08:21.850 --> 08:24.250
Chunk.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.550
Did you put all that
GoPro footage together?

08:26.560 --> 08:29.090
It's good to go.

08:29.090 --> 08:31.830
Let's focus on senior staff.
Who had motive?

08:31.830 --> 08:34.299
Everyone has certainly moved on
to bigger and better things.

08:34.299 --> 08:35.830
Well, former lieutenant governor

08:35.830 --> 08:39.000
Garrett Aiken is now
the governor of Connecticut.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.330
Nice upgrade there.

08:40.340 --> 08:42.470
Former chief of staff
Travis Robbins

08:42.470 --> 08:43.770
is now partner at Gage/white,

08:43.770 --> 08:45.940
and former treasurer
Avery Tottenham

08:45.940 --> 08:48.140
runs one of the most successful
hedge funds in the country.

08:48.140 --> 08:50.410
Let's find out how they felt
about their boss.

08:50.410 --> 08:52.380
Excuse me, Dr. Bull?
Max, Dylan.

08:52.380 --> 08:53.780
We were just getting started.

08:53.780 --> 08:55.780
We're talking about bosses.

08:55.790 --> 08:57.280
Everybody hates the boss,
don't they?

08:57.290 --> 08:58.820
Not everybody.

08:58.820 --> 09:00.960
"hate" ' a strong word.
I wouldn't say hate. No!

09:00.960 --> 09:02.920
Oh, look at you scramble.
It's adorable.

09:02.930 --> 09:05.860
I know you guys are

09:05.860 --> 09:07.130
the experts on strategy,

09:07.130 --> 09:09.000
but I'm not sure I'm
comfortable with this.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.770
My brother was a good man;
The last thing he would want

09:11.770 --> 09:14.400
is an innocent person
to be accused of murder.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.840
Do you think
this was Walt's fault?

09:15.840 --> 09:16.870
Of course not.

09:16.870 --> 09:18.770
Neither do I.

09:18.770 --> 09:22.880
So, if our strategy
of pointing the finger

09:22.880 --> 09:25.250
helps us find out
who actually did this,

09:25.250 --> 09:27.380
then you and Dylan
get to keep your company,

09:27.380 --> 09:30.150
and the governor's
widow gets justice.

09:30.150 --> 09:33.220
Okay, let's talk about
voir dire.

09:33.220 --> 09:35.260
Who do we not want on the jury?

09:35.260 --> 09:37.220
Her.

09:37.230 --> 09:39.790
We do not want risk-takers.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.700
People who don't take risks

09:41.700 --> 09:43.200
like to blame people who do.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.730
They'll blame the skydiver
and not the skydiving company.

09:46.740 --> 09:48.340
There's our jury plan.

09:48.340 --> 09:50.040
Let's keep her off the jury

09:50.040 --> 09:53.340
and find some people
who don't take risks.

09:57.150 --> 09:58.510
Hello, Dr. Bull.

09:58.510 --> 10:00.580
Liberty.

10:00.580 --> 10:04.290
So... here we are.

10:04.290 --> 10:05.850
Opposing sides.

10:05.860 --> 10:07.120
Here we are.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.660
Um, I have to admit,
I was surprised

10:09.660 --> 10:12.860
to hear you took this case...
pro Bono, I'm assuming...

10:12.860 --> 10:15.400
out of all the other cases
in the entire country.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.700
But still, no hard feelings.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.530
Good luck, Liberty.

10:20.540 --> 10:22.340
Why did you say it like that?

10:22.340 --> 10:23.500
How'd I say it?

10:23.510 --> 10:25.270
It was a little adversarial.

10:25.270 --> 10:27.510
Well, we are adversaries.

10:27.510 --> 10:31.350
So, the gloves are off already?

10:31.350 --> 10:33.810
You're not gonna get
inside my head, Dr. Bull.

10:33.820 --> 10:36.350
I wasn't trying to. Sounds like
I'm already in there.

10:36.350 --> 10:38.790
You're not.

10:38.790 --> 10:41.190
Okay.

10:41.190 --> 10:43.920
Raise your hand
if you like camping.

10:43.930 --> 10:44.990
How'd it go with Liberty?

10:44.990 --> 10:46.030
She's fine.

10:46.030 --> 10:48.330
How come you don't like camping?

10:48.330 --> 10:50.060
Just doesn't seem very safe.

10:50.070 --> 10:51.470
That's okay.

10:51.470 --> 10:54.340
So, for those of you
who do like camping,

10:54.340 --> 10:57.270
raise your hand if you've ever
purchased bear repellant.

10:57.270 --> 10:59.270
Plaintiff would like to strike

10:59.280 --> 11:01.410
jurors three, five and 11.

11:04.010 --> 11:06.050
She's weeding out
all the risk-averse jurors.

11:06.050 --> 11:08.020
Striking all our favorites.

11:08.020 --> 11:11.750
Looks like Liberty
did her homework.

11:11.750 --> 11:15.090
This isn't really the time for
a proud-parent moment, Marissa.

11:15.090 --> 11:18.890
Please raise your hand
if your favorite color is red.

11:18.890 --> 11:23.200
Raise your hand if your
least favorite color is red.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.430
Okay. She might be
taking this personally.

11:25.430 --> 11:26.900
It's not all about you, Bull.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.870
Please raise your hand

11:28.870 --> 11:31.510
if you don't buy extra insurance

11:31.510 --> 11:33.110
when you rent a car.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.610
Please raise your hand
if you always

11:34.610 --> 11:37.340
buy extra insurance
when you rent a car.

11:37.350 --> 11:39.480
Taxi or Uber?
Subway?

11:39.480 --> 11:41.650
Raise your hand if you think
you deserve a raise.

11:41.650 --> 11:43.680
Please raise your hand

11:43.690 --> 11:47.490
if you would feel burdened
if you went to work tomorrow

11:47.490 --> 11:50.220
and your salary was tripled.

11:50.230 --> 11:51.930
He's the one I want.

11:51.930 --> 11:53.390
Jacob.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.660
She doesn't know
if she should strike him.

11:55.670 --> 11:58.070
Doesn't realize
he's risk averse.

11:58.070 --> 12:01.300
Come on, Liberty.
Don't do it.

12:06.780 --> 12:08.040
Hmm.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.510
Acceptable to the plaintiff,
your honor.

12:10.510 --> 12:13.880
It's more fun than
I thought it'd be.

12:15.520 --> 12:18.450
<i>I'm writing an article</i>
<i>for</i> visionary weekly,

12:18.450 --> 12:20.690
ranking the top PR firms
in New York.

12:20.690 --> 12:24.060
I'm sure you know we have
unparalleled resources here.

12:24.060 --> 12:26.060
I'm very proud of
what we've built.

12:26.060 --> 12:28.530
It's very impressive,
and in such a short time.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.730
So, before this, you worked

12:30.730 --> 12:33.200
for the late Connecticut
governor, Dean Whitfield?

12:33.200 --> 12:34.840
I was his press secretary.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.140
You know, that must've been

12:36.140 --> 12:37.870
a really difficult
transition for you.

12:37.870 --> 12:40.470
Do you mind talking about
the skydiving accident?

12:40.480 --> 12:41.680
I don't mind,
but I wasn't there,

12:41.680 --> 12:42.943
so there's not much
I can say about it.

12:42.950 --> 12:45.850
Well, you may not have
been there physically,

12:45.850 --> 12:48.050
but you certainly
were there in spirit.

12:48.050 --> 12:49.420
What do you mean?

12:49.420 --> 12:51.820
Well, I obtained some video
footage from the plane that day.

12:51.820 --> 12:55.290
Do you know when
it's gonna happen, sir?

12:55.290 --> 12:57.620
Ronnie thinks it's gonna
come out in the next few days.

12:57.630 --> 12:59.060
We need to prepare
for the worst.

12:59.060 --> 13:00.830
Ronnie thinks
it's going to come out

13:00.830 --> 13:01.860
in the next few days.

13:01.860 --> 13:03.900
You're Ronnie, right, Veronica?

13:03.900 --> 13:05.930
What was coming out
in the next few days?

13:05.940 --> 13:08.640
It was a chaotic time.
I-i don't remember.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.440
You don't remember
preparing for the worst?

13:11.440 --> 13:13.140
Stellar damage control.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.940
Tell me how you dealt with this.

13:14.940 --> 13:17.080
Okay.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.280
Off the record.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.550
Understood.

13:19.550 --> 13:24.380
There was an FBI investigation
into governor Whitfield.

13:24.390 --> 13:26.390
Some false accusations.

13:26.390 --> 13:29.390
After he died, they closed it,
as they should have.

13:29.390 --> 13:31.930
There's no reason for any of
this to be in your article.

13:31.930 --> 13:33.190
Oh, you have my word.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.000
This will never be mentioned
in <i> visionary weekly.</i>

13:36.000 --> 13:36.960
Perfect.

13:36.970 --> 13:38.100
Let's continue.

13:38.100 --> 13:39.570
Let's.

13:39.570 --> 13:42.870
Well, it's not
an ideal jury, but pretty solid,

13:42.870 --> 13:44.770
considering Liberty
guessed our strategy,

13:44.770 --> 13:47.340
and used all her strikes
on risk-averse jurors.

13:47.340 --> 13:49.680
This case is about control,
risk and fear.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.850
Everybody's afraid of something,

13:51.850 --> 13:53.580
usually something
they don't understand.

13:53.580 --> 13:55.520
Oh, I understand spiders,

13:55.520 --> 13:57.820
but I'm still afraid of them.

13:57.820 --> 14:00.020
But there are

14:00.020 --> 14:02.320
failure, success, interestingly,

14:02.320 --> 14:04.530
death... and intimacy.

14:04.530 --> 14:06.990
Wait, why look at me
when you say intimacy?

14:07.000 --> 14:10.430
Well, I'm most afraid
of an IRS audit.

14:10.430 --> 14:12.570
That's more of an admission
of guilt than anything else,

14:12.570 --> 14:13.800
but it's a very popular fear.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.870
Oh. Glad to know
that I'm not original.

14:16.870 --> 14:18.910
Benny?

14:18.910 --> 14:20.670
What you afraid of?

14:20.680 --> 14:22.410
Making a mistake.

14:22.410 --> 14:26.010
Fear of failure,
previously mentioned.

14:26.020 --> 14:28.620
Well, she didn't strike
our top pick, Jacob.

14:28.620 --> 14:32.020
Yeah, what makes him
good for us?

14:32.020 --> 14:34.420
He's got a strong fear
of losing control.

14:34.420 --> 14:36.720
I think he's a perfectionist,
but outside the box.

14:36.730 --> 14:40.090
He needs to know the
outcome before it happens.

14:40.100 --> 14:41.760
You just described yourself.

14:43.530 --> 14:45.870
You like Jacob because
he's basically your mirror.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.800
Back to work, everyone!

14:48.800 --> 14:49.870
Uh, forgetting something?

14:49.870 --> 14:51.810
Your biometric watch.

14:51.810 --> 14:54.880
So we can keep tabs
on your juror.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.380
I get it.

14:58.050 --> 15:01.580
Hey. Got a minute?

15:01.580 --> 15:03.650
Depends.
Another favor?

15:03.650 --> 15:04.690
Maybe.

15:04.690 --> 15:06.120
I'm all out of favors.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.420
Aw, since when?

15:07.420 --> 15:10.190
Oh, since you got
the last three.

15:10.190 --> 15:12.130
Favors usually go both ways.

15:12.130 --> 15:13.460
I'm starting to feel used here.

15:13.460 --> 15:16.500
Oh. Should I do you
a favor, then?

15:16.500 --> 15:19.830
Mm. That'd be nice.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.040
Like right now?

15:22.040 --> 15:23.800
I could use a coffee.

15:23.810 --> 15:25.640
Iced latte.

15:25.640 --> 15:27.710
Seriously?
Yeah.

15:27.710 --> 15:28.880
A coffee?

15:28.880 --> 15:30.780
This must be a really big favor.

15:30.780 --> 15:31.980
What do you need?

15:31.980 --> 15:34.750
So, we are representing

15:34.750 --> 15:36.150
the skydiving company

15:36.150 --> 15:38.120
in governor Whitfield's
wrongful death lawsuit.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.820
I just met with his
former press secretary,

15:39.820 --> 15:42.220
and she told me that the FBI
was investigating Whitfield

15:42.220 --> 15:44.220
during the time of his death.

15:45.860 --> 15:47.830
Uh, this was an investigation

15:47.830 --> 15:49.560
out of the
Washington field office.

15:49.570 --> 15:51.530
Ongoing for two years.

15:53.170 --> 15:55.240
How's the boyfriend?

15:55.240 --> 15:56.840
Gabe was his name?

15:56.840 --> 15:59.670
We're fine. He's fine.
Everything's fine.

15:59.680 --> 16:00.840
Looks like governor Whitfield

16:00.840 --> 16:02.380
was under investigation
for corruption.

16:02.380 --> 16:04.680
At the time of the accident,

16:04.680 --> 16:08.420
a federal grand jury was about
to indict him on 28 counts.

16:08.420 --> 16:09.620
Whoa.

16:09.620 --> 16:12.120
Obviously, this is
highly-sensitive information,

16:12.120 --> 16:13.320
so you cannot disclose.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.920
Don't worry. I know the drill.

16:14.920 --> 16:17.620
Now, we have to find out
who had access

16:17.630 --> 16:19.990
to the governor's parachutes
that day.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.400
So, we're gonna
retrace their steps.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.660
Where's chunk?

16:22.670 --> 16:24.530
He's afraid of heights.

16:24.530 --> 16:25.870
Wait, does that mean we're...?

16:25.870 --> 16:27.970
Class starts in five minutes!

16:27.970 --> 16:29.300
Yes.

16:29.310 --> 16:31.640
<i>In Walt's flight logs,
he noted that he packed</i>

16:31.640 --> 16:34.640
<i>the governor's parachutes
at precisely 4:17</i>

16:34.640 --> 16:36.680
<i>the afternoon
before the accident.</i>

16:36.680 --> 16:38.710
<i>He then locked it up
until he retrieved it</i>

16:38.710 --> 16:40.180
<i>the following day.</i>

16:40.180 --> 16:41.980
<i>Governor Whitfield
and his senior staff</i>

16:41.980 --> 16:44.280
<i>arrived around 6:00 A.M.</i>

16:44.290 --> 16:46.090
<i>For their accelerated
free fall program.</i>

16:46.090 --> 16:48.260
<i>That class lasted
about four hours.</i>

16:48.260 --> 16:49.790
There we go. Perfect.

16:49.790 --> 16:51.590
Nice.
Good job. You got it.

16:51.590 --> 16:55.060
One, pull.
Two, hold the safety altitude.

16:55.060 --> 16:58.070
Three, pull stable.
Four, land safely.

16:58.070 --> 17:01.270
This is gonna take four hours?

17:05.410 --> 17:07.010
Everybody ready?

17:07.010 --> 17:08.540
Thumbs up?
Thumbs up.

17:08.540 --> 17:09.940
Let's go have some fun.

17:09.950 --> 17:12.579
Good. Let's head out.

17:12.579 --> 17:14.280
Thanks, boss.

17:17.450 --> 17:20.950
Between that moment and
the time the governor jumped,

17:20.960 --> 17:23.790
we know someone cut
the cords on his parachutes.

17:23.790 --> 17:25.030
Couldn't have been easy.

17:25.030 --> 17:26.390
Are you kidding?

17:26.400 --> 17:28.960
I've had at least three
opportunities to cut your cords.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.700
They walked directly from
the lockers to the plane,

17:31.700 --> 17:34.030
and were together
the entire time.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.200
So, they probably
did it right here.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.570
You okay?

17:39.580 --> 17:40.740
Yeah.

17:40.740 --> 17:42.340
So, when do we jump?

17:42.340 --> 17:44.510
We're not jumping.

17:44.510 --> 17:46.480
What?

17:46.480 --> 17:48.980
You can tell the pilot to turn
the plane around, head back.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.080
But I want to jump.

17:50.090 --> 17:52.090
Yeah, why did we take
a four-hour class

17:52.090 --> 17:53.320
if we're not gonna jump?

17:53.320 --> 17:55.390
We were retracing steps.

17:55.390 --> 17:57.490
I'm with Bull.

17:57.490 --> 17:58.690
There's a perfectly good runway

17:58.690 --> 18:00.590
about ten minutes from here.

18:00.600 --> 18:04.030
But, Bull, how are you a pilot
and scared to jump?

18:04.030 --> 18:07.700
I don't have a fear, I just have
a healthy respect for gravity.

18:08.770 --> 18:10.503
All right, if they want
to jump, they should jump.

18:10.510 --> 18:11.670
They're fully prepped.

18:11.670 --> 18:13.270
It's safe.

18:15.280 --> 18:17.210
Just remember
to pull your rip cord.

18:17.210 --> 18:18.980
I'll see you at the office.

18:18.980 --> 18:21.650
Okay. Ready?

18:23.350 --> 18:24.650
Okay, I'm ready.

18:24.650 --> 18:26.020
You're up, Blondie.

18:26.020 --> 18:27.490
I hope I see you at the office.

18:27.490 --> 18:28.520
Get it, girl.

18:36.670 --> 18:39.410
Looks like we've got ourselves

18:39.410 --> 18:41.380
a murder mystery.

18:41.380 --> 18:42.810
Now we just need to solve it.

18:42.810 --> 18:45.680
All three of these people
have motive and opportunity.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.120
If the governor's senior staff
was involved in the corruption,

18:48.120 --> 18:49.820
why did the FBI shelve
the investigation?

18:49.820 --> 18:52.950
Well, my contact said governor
Whitfield was the big fish.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.890
Everyone knows that the senior
staff usually takes the fall.

18:55.890 --> 18:57.190
Unless they flip.

18:57.190 --> 19:00.900
Testify against the boss
to gain immunity.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.600
Which is why Whitfield took them
on that team-building exercise,

19:03.600 --> 19:04.700
keep them close.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.700
I got to admit,
I'm still feeling

19:06.700 --> 19:08.300
the adrenaline rush
of that jump.

19:08.310 --> 19:10.170
Me, too. It was
life-changing.

19:10.170 --> 19:12.540
It was an eye-opening,
team-building exercise.

19:12.540 --> 19:13.910
You didn't even jump.

19:13.910 --> 19:15.280
Not all bonding
is with the boss.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.510
Right.

19:16.510 --> 19:18.880
Thanks, Bull.
It was almost as fun

19:18.880 --> 19:19.880
as high-five day.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.150
I forgot about high-five day!

19:21.150 --> 19:23.190
Oop.

19:23.190 --> 19:24.490
Are we seriously considering

19:24.490 --> 19:25.690
putting governor Aiken
on the stand?

19:25.690 --> 19:28.160
Not if the governor
has anything to do with it.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.460
Check this out.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.130
Ah, yes. You know,
I've always liked

19:32.130 --> 19:33.800
the seal of the state
of Connecticut.

19:33.800 --> 19:36.330
It's sturdy yet soft.

19:36.330 --> 19:38.400
This is a cease and desist

19:38.400 --> 19:40.100
from the Connecticut
Attorney General.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.200
We have been put on notice

19:42.210 --> 19:44.510
that it will be considered
harassment if we contact

19:44.510 --> 19:46.580
any of the governor's
former staff.

19:46.580 --> 19:47.980
It's all bark,
very little that's actionable.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.240
It's just a warning.

19:49.250 --> 19:52.310
Am I the only one that's
intimidated by all of this?

19:52.320 --> 19:53.820
These guys could bury us.

19:53.820 --> 19:56.020
Plus, it seems
a little bit unethical

19:56.020 --> 19:58.250
to point a finger at a sitting governor.
We won't,

19:58.260 --> 20:00.220
not until we've ruled out
the other suspects.

20:00.220 --> 20:03.390
The evidence that Danny
brought us on Travis and Avery

20:03.390 --> 20:04.693
should be enough
to go after them.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.660
Wait, we can't bring
this evidence up in court.

20:06.660 --> 20:08.030
It's relevant to our defense.

20:08.030 --> 20:09.930
The judge will allow it.

20:09.930 --> 20:12.170
No, what I mean is, um,
I promised my contact

20:12.170 --> 20:13.400
that this wouldn't get out.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.100
The details are specific
to the FBI's investigation.

20:16.110 --> 20:17.970
If it gets out,
I-i could burn my source.

20:17.980 --> 20:20.240
We need to convince the jury
it was sabotage.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.410
This evidence provides motive.

20:22.410 --> 20:24.650
You deal with your
source, Danny.

20:24.650 --> 20:25.850
Okay.

20:28.750 --> 20:32.120
Just to be clear,
you want me to accuse

20:32.120 --> 20:34.590
two of the former
governor's staff of murder.

20:34.590 --> 20:36.830
Just to be clear, yes.

20:36.830 --> 20:38.030
Hey.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.630
Uh, chunk, got a sec?

20:39.630 --> 20:41.300
Yeah, I was just tinkering

20:41.300 --> 20:43.530
with, uh, Max's look
for the trial.

20:43.530 --> 20:45.500
I'm thinking
British traditional.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.270
Okay, this might be a mistake.

20:47.270 --> 20:48.670
The color or cut?

20:48.670 --> 20:50.040
No, uh, the suit is great.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.510
I just am worried about Max

20:52.510 --> 20:54.380
trying this case.

20:54.380 --> 20:55.980
Maybe we should put Benny on it.

20:55.980 --> 20:57.380
Bull's got his eye on him.

20:57.380 --> 21:00.050
Max has been resistant
to our strategy.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.150
I mean, if he doesn't fully
commit, the jury'll know.

21:02.150 --> 21:04.220
He hasn't been in front
of a jury in years.

21:04.220 --> 21:05.490
Well, at least he'll look good.

21:05.490 --> 21:07.020
I'm serious, chunk.

21:07.020 --> 21:08.260
Look, I know.

21:08.260 --> 21:10.190
I've been working with him
on his presentation,

21:10.190 --> 21:12.060
his posture;
He's doing his best.

21:12.060 --> 21:14.000
Max is trying
to save his company.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.500
He just lost his brother,
and clearly that impacted him.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.500
The jury will feel his pain.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.300
Just got to give him a chance.

21:20.300 --> 21:23.340
Okay. But Benny is on deck.

21:23.340 --> 21:24.740
We need to have a quick hook

21:24.740 --> 21:27.010
in case Max can't get
his head in the game.

21:27.010 --> 21:30.280
You were governor Whitfield's
chief of staff.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.080
Yes.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.750
Did you like him?

21:33.750 --> 21:35.220
Objection. Relevance.

21:35.220 --> 21:36.350
Overruled.

21:36.350 --> 21:38.490
Witness can answer.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.390
I liked him very much.

21:41.390 --> 21:42.960
No, I did not like him, at all.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.790
Why not?

21:44.800 --> 21:47.100
He was an arrogant,
lying blowhard.

21:47.100 --> 21:48.500
At least she's honest.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.570
Well, oddly enough,
they like her.

21:51.570 --> 21:52.930
So do I.

21:52.940 --> 21:56.170
Why were you skydiving that day?

21:56.170 --> 21:59.170
Governor Whitfield loved
team-building activities.

21:59.180 --> 22:00.710
One year, we drove race cars.

22:00.710 --> 22:03.080
Last year, we did paintball.
This year, skydiving.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.550
What if you were afraid to jump

22:05.550 --> 22:07.720
out of a plane?
I wasn't afraid.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.390
Avery and Garrett
were a little scared.

22:10.390 --> 22:12.190
I was pumped.

22:12.190 --> 22:14.760
So we hate this guy, right?

22:14.760 --> 22:17.930
Mirror Bull
does not like this guy.

22:17.930 --> 22:19.960
There is no mirror Bull.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.760
<i>Governor Whitfield would take us</i>

22:21.770 --> 22:24.770
on these thrill-seeking
adventures to show off.

22:24.770 --> 22:27.640
I guess the last one didn't
turn out too good for him.

22:27.640 --> 22:28.770
Ouch.

22:28.770 --> 22:31.470
Isn't it true
a corruption scandal

22:31.480 --> 22:33.410
involving all of you
was about to come out?

22:33.410 --> 22:34.810
Objection!

22:34.810 --> 22:36.910
This is clearly a cheap stunt

22:36.910 --> 22:39.680
by the defense, in an attempt
to distract the jury

22:39.680 --> 22:41.720
from the facts of this case.
This case is about

22:41.720 --> 22:43.490
fault in a skydiving accident.

22:43.490 --> 22:45.420
We believe
the two are connected.

22:45.420 --> 22:46.960
On what planet?

22:46.960 --> 22:49.220
Your honor, the
governor's senior staff

22:49.230 --> 22:50.390
has been implicated

22:50.390 --> 22:52.830
in an investigation alleging

22:52.830 --> 22:56.200
they accepted bribes
for political gain.

22:57.070 --> 22:58.330
I've made copies for everyone

22:58.340 --> 23:01.340
and would like to enter
them into evidence.

23:02.240 --> 23:03.840
I'll allow it.

23:06.380 --> 23:08.040
Would you like me
to repeat the question?

23:08.040 --> 23:09.540
That's not necessary.

23:09.550 --> 23:11.950
At this time, I'd like to invoke
my fifth amendment...

23:11.950 --> 23:13.750
...right against
self-incrimination.

23:13.750 --> 23:15.420
Did you...

23:15.420 --> 23:18.750
Sabotage governor
Whitfield's parachutes?

23:18.760 --> 23:21.120
Did you murder your boss?

23:21.120 --> 23:22.320
I did not.

23:22.330 --> 23:24.260
Of course not. No.

23:24.260 --> 23:27.460
The jurors all
believe 'em, Bull.

23:27.460 --> 23:29.360
So do I.

23:29.370 --> 23:31.800
Neither of these staffers
killed Whitfield.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.000
What's our next move?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.640
This murder is looking like
a power play by Aiken

23:35.640 --> 23:37.040
to become governor.

23:38.910 --> 23:40.480
I think we have no choice

23:40.480 --> 23:42.940
but to put governor Aiken
on the stand.

23:52.410 --> 23:54.310
Why didn't you tell Rick
you broke up with Gabe?

23:54.310 --> 23:55.340
Why does it matter?

23:55.340 --> 23:57.910
Because you like him
and you're single.

23:57.910 --> 23:59.180
When did I say I liked him?

23:59.180 --> 24:01.050
You told me he asked
you about Gabe.

24:01.050 --> 24:03.510
So? Before you mentioned
the corruption scandal.

24:03.520 --> 24:06.020
I was just telling you about our
meeting in chronological order.

24:06.020 --> 24:07.320
Right.
Can we just focus?

24:07.320 --> 24:08.720
Aiken is taking the stand
any minute,

24:08.720 --> 24:10.020
and we need something on him.

24:12.630 --> 24:15.030
Okay, it's not very juicy.

24:15.030 --> 24:16.490
But when he was
lieutenant governor,

24:16.500 --> 24:18.260
Aiken moved his office
to another building.

24:18.260 --> 24:19.760
You're right, that's not juicy.

24:19.770 --> 24:21.400
A week before the accident.

24:21.400 --> 24:22.530
Juicier.

24:22.540 --> 24:24.040
Danny?

24:24.040 --> 24:25.300
Hey.

24:25.310 --> 24:26.640
Can we speak privately?

24:26.640 --> 24:28.140
Sure.

24:28.140 --> 24:29.540
Cable.

24:30.940 --> 24:35.180
I'll go tell Bull about
the semi-juicy detail.

24:35.180 --> 24:37.350
She broke up with Gabe.

24:40.090 --> 24:42.120
I'll let you go first.

24:42.120 --> 24:43.820
We had to use the information.

24:43.820 --> 24:45.660
Right. I thought
maybe you would lead off

24:45.660 --> 24:46.990
with some sort of apology.

24:46.990 --> 24:49.360
I mean, you could've
given me a warning.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.630
I am sorry, Rick, but I didn't
have a choice, okay?

24:51.630 --> 24:53.600
And these people may be suspects
in the governor's murder.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.200
Sensitive and specific
to the FBI investigation.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.370
That's what I said.

24:57.370 --> 24:58.900
I had planned on telling you.

24:58.910 --> 25:00.370
But I didn't have a choice.

25:00.370 --> 25:02.770
This is my fault.

25:02.780 --> 25:04.180
I should've known
this would happen.

25:04.180 --> 25:05.340
That's not fair.

25:05.350 --> 25:08.010
No... it's not.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.820
Governor Aiken!
Governor Aiken, any comment?

25:12.820 --> 25:14.250
No comment.

25:17.290 --> 25:19.190
Connecticut governor
Garrett Aiken

25:19.190 --> 25:20.490
has arrived at the courthouse

25:20.490 --> 25:21.790
and is scheduled
to testify today

25:21.790 --> 25:23.930
in the wrongful death suit.

25:23.930 --> 25:25.800
Governor Aiken
will take the stand shortly.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.430
It is unclear
if he will be implicated

25:27.430 --> 25:30.070
in the corruption allegations
brought up

25:30.070 --> 25:32.970
during the former chief of staff
Travis Robbins' testimony.

25:32.970 --> 25:35.410
<i>Governor Aiken,</i> would
you say that you

25:35.410 --> 25:37.480
and governor Whitfield
were friends?

25:37.480 --> 25:39.080
We had a strong relationship.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.710
But you had differences.

25:40.710 --> 25:42.710
We were both from Connecticut,

25:42.720 --> 25:44.480
and we loved our state,

25:44.480 --> 25:48.120
but we had different
ideas for its future.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.690
Oh, as I'm sure you know,

25:49.690 --> 25:51.290
the jurors love this guy.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.420
He's a natural leader.

25:53.430 --> 25:54.860
You had ideas,

25:54.860 --> 25:57.660
but it didn't matter because
he was the governor, not you.

25:57.660 --> 26:00.030
And I accepted that.

26:00.030 --> 26:01.870
And when you became governor,

26:01.870 --> 26:04.300
were you able
to implement your ideas?

26:04.300 --> 26:05.400
I changed course

26:05.410 --> 26:08.340
on a few things
I didn't agree with. Yes.

26:08.340 --> 26:10.170
But I've done everything
in my power to honor

26:10.180 --> 26:12.080
governor Whitfield's legacy.
I'm well aware

26:12.080 --> 26:14.750
that I wasn't voted
into office, he was.

26:16.520 --> 26:20.050
Look, this past year
has been difficult

26:20.050 --> 26:21.790
on the entire state
of Connecticut.

26:21.790 --> 26:23.890
And to be honest, I don't think
I could've gotten through it

26:23.890 --> 26:27.260
without the love and
support of my wife,

26:27.260 --> 26:28.260
Colleen.

26:28.260 --> 26:29.690
Colleen is my rock.

26:31.060 --> 26:33.260
She always steers me
in the right direction.

26:34.530 --> 26:36.270
She's been incredible
during this difficult time,

26:36.270 --> 26:37.540
and I've relied
on her thoroughly.

26:37.540 --> 26:39.670
Yeah, the jury just spiked
for this guy.

26:39.670 --> 26:41.770
Maybe he should run
for president.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.740
When I think of
how I should fill

26:44.740 --> 26:46.110
governor Whitfield's shoes...

26:46.110 --> 26:48.850
When did cable say Aiken moved
his office to another building?

26:49.780 --> 26:52.180
Six days before the accident.

26:52.190 --> 26:53.480
Why?

26:53.490 --> 26:56.290
What? Bull? What's going on?

26:56.290 --> 26:58.990
Bull, Bull, you should probably
have Max cut him off

26:58.990 --> 27:01.830
before they throw a parade
for Aiken.

27:01.830 --> 27:02.990
Max.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Come here.

27:10.140 --> 27:11.900
Uh...

27:11.900 --> 27:14.840
Your honor, I-i...
I just have one more question.

27:14.840 --> 27:17.540
About a week before
the accident,

27:17.540 --> 27:20.780
you moved your office
out of the building

27:20.780 --> 27:23.980
where governor Whitfield
had his office.

27:23.980 --> 27:25.550
Objection.
Where is this going?

27:25.550 --> 27:28.450
Let's find out together.
Overruled.

27:28.450 --> 27:30.090
Sir, did you move your office

27:30.090 --> 27:31.260
because you found out that

27:31.260 --> 27:33.090
governor Whitfield
was sleeping with your wife?

27:33.090 --> 27:35.330
Objection!
This is completely

27:35.330 --> 27:36.590
outrageous and irrelevant.

27:36.600 --> 27:39.430
Sounds kind of relevant to me.

27:39.430 --> 27:41.400
Overruled.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.840
The witness will
answer the question.

27:50.880 --> 27:53.180
Yes.

27:53.180 --> 27:55.350
That's why I moved my office

27:55.350 --> 27:56.780
to another building.

28:00.850 --> 28:02.920
So the murder wasn't political,

28:02.920 --> 28:04.720
it was personal.

28:06.190 --> 28:08.960
Biometrics have completely
shifted on Aiken.

28:10.760 --> 28:13.560
There goes his shot
at president.

28:14.370 --> 28:16.470
Do you think this is a game?

28:16.470 --> 28:17.940
Maybe it's best
if we don't interact

28:17.940 --> 28:19.240
until after the trial, Liberty.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.270
Exposing an irrelevant affair?

28:21.270 --> 28:23.370
You couldn't win this
case on the facts,

28:23.380 --> 28:26.210
so you had to play dirty?

28:26.210 --> 28:28.680
Uh, I'm on the right side
of this one, Liberty.

28:28.680 --> 28:29.950
You know,

28:29.950 --> 28:32.350
you always have to be
in control, don't you?

28:32.350 --> 28:33.920
That's not why I took this case.

28:33.920 --> 28:37.560
You saw me on a big case,
national news,

28:37.560 --> 28:39.220
and you had nothing
to do with it.

28:39.230 --> 28:40.660
I didn't call you for help,

28:40.660 --> 28:44.060
so you ran to the other side.

28:44.060 --> 28:46.860
Oh, I've learned so much
from you, Dr. Bull.

28:46.870 --> 28:49.270
Every time I've worked
with you, but this time,

28:49.270 --> 28:51.370
I've learned my biggest lesson.

28:51.370 --> 28:53.070
So thank you for that.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.080
We have 11 of 12 jurors,

29:05.080 --> 29:07.490
one more than we need
in a civil trial.

29:07.490 --> 29:09.450
So we move on
to closing arguments.

29:09.460 --> 29:10.490
Benny, you have a call.

29:10.490 --> 29:11.860
Tell them I'll call them back.

29:11.860 --> 29:13.260
It's the U.S. attorney's office.

29:13.260 --> 29:14.960
They say it's important.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.660
I'm not your secretary, man.

29:21.370 --> 29:23.870
So, out of curiosity,

29:23.870 --> 29:25.940
who was the lone
holdout on the jury?

29:25.940 --> 29:27.240
Jacob.

29:27.240 --> 29:29.610
Huh. The man
in the mirror.

29:29.610 --> 29:32.410
So you're not convinced
it was Aiken, either.

29:32.410 --> 29:34.450
It doesn't matter.

29:34.450 --> 29:35.880
Doesn't it?

29:39.750 --> 29:43.290
Your honor, we'd like to call
a rebuttal witness.

29:45.430 --> 29:46.590
Dylan Hyland.

29:53.930 --> 29:55.200
Ms. Hyland,

29:55.200 --> 29:57.400
first, I am very sorry
for your loss.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.100
Thank you.

29:59.110 --> 30:01.440
Were you aware that a few
weeks before the accident,

30:01.440 --> 30:02.640
the late governor,
Dean Whitfield,

30:02.640 --> 30:03.940
signed a new zoning bill

30:03.940 --> 30:06.610
that would allow for local and
regional airports to expand?

30:06.610 --> 30:08.010
No.

30:08.010 --> 30:11.250
It turns out, the airport your
skydiving company leased from

30:11.250 --> 30:12.580
was going to expand
dramatically,

30:12.590 --> 30:13.920
and established airlines

30:13.920 --> 30:15.690
were coming in to take over

30:15.690 --> 30:17.490
the existing hangars
and runways.

30:17.490 --> 30:18.890
What are you talking about?

30:18.890 --> 30:21.190
It's right here.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.430
In fact,

30:25.430 --> 30:29.630
two days before the accident,
your company

30:29.640 --> 30:31.600
received notification
that its lease

30:31.600 --> 30:33.640
would not be renewed
at the airport,

30:33.640 --> 30:36.240
effectively shutting you down.

30:36.240 --> 30:37.440
Did your father
tell you about this?

30:37.440 --> 30:39.110
No. I had no idea.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.080
After the governor's death...

30:45.250 --> 30:47.020
...his replacement,
Garrett Aiken,

30:47.020 --> 30:49.590
reversed the new zoning laws,

30:49.590 --> 30:51.320
which ended up
saving your company.

30:51.320 --> 30:53.790
So maybe you should
be thanking him

30:53.790 --> 30:55.860
instead of accusing him
of murder.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.160
Here is a portion
of the videos obtained

30:59.170 --> 31:02.130
from governor Whitfield's

31:02.130 --> 31:04.670
and your father's GoPro cameras
moments before the accident.

31:04.670 --> 31:06.670
I don't want to see this.

31:06.670 --> 31:08.740
What's Liberty doing?

31:08.740 --> 31:10.110
Attacking.

31:13.110 --> 31:14.980
You okay, Walt?

31:14.980 --> 31:16.180
You don't seem like
yourself today.

31:16.180 --> 31:17.250
Should we not do this?

31:17.250 --> 31:19.220
I'm okay.

31:19.220 --> 31:21.090
Just business stuff.

31:21.090 --> 31:22.290
All good?

31:22.290 --> 31:23.550
I hope so.

31:27.060 --> 31:28.790
Help me!

31:28.790 --> 31:30.760
I can't let this happen!

31:30.760 --> 31:33.660
I got you, I got you!
Help me! Help!

31:33.670 --> 31:35.330
I got you!
Help me!

31:35.330 --> 31:36.530
Just hold on!

31:39.240 --> 31:41.540
Governor Whitfield signed a bill

31:41.540 --> 31:44.280
that was going to put
your father out of business.

31:44.280 --> 31:47.040
I know this is difficult
to hear, Ms. Hyland,

31:47.050 --> 31:49.950
but your father sabotaged
the governor's parachutes.

31:49.950 --> 31:51.150
Objection!

31:51.150 --> 31:52.980
This is a preposterous theory

31:52.990 --> 31:54.180
fabricated by Ms. Davis

31:54.190 --> 31:55.890
to further slander
my brother's name!

31:55.890 --> 31:57.560
The defense has their theory,

31:57.560 --> 31:59.420
and we have ours.

31:59.430 --> 32:01.560
We have motive, we have audio

32:01.560 --> 32:03.290
of the murderer
changing his mind

32:03.300 --> 32:04.930
at the last minute.

32:04.930 --> 32:06.600
You heard him.

32:06.600 --> 32:09.130
"I can't let this happen"

32:20.950 --> 32:23.280
So it wasn't governor Aiken
who killed him.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.350
That leaves only one person

32:27.350 --> 32:29.450
with motive and means
to kill the governor.

32:29.460 --> 32:31.620
Bull, what are you thinking?

32:37.720 --> 32:40.420
In order to win this
case, we're gonna have to

32:40.430 --> 32:43.660
change our strategy
for your closing, Max.

32:43.660 --> 32:46.760
What would you like me to say?

32:46.770 --> 32:48.000
Now we know Walt was responsible

32:48.000 --> 32:49.870
for the governor's death.

32:49.870 --> 32:51.970
Right?

32:51.970 --> 32:54.270
Maybe you shouldn't
be in here for this.

32:54.270 --> 32:55.870
I'd like her to stay.

32:55.870 --> 32:57.370
The only way we win this case

32:57.380 --> 32:59.710
is for you to get out
in front of that jury

32:59.710 --> 33:02.180
and tell them Walt did this.

33:02.180 --> 33:07.020
Uh, you want me to, um...
Tell the jury...

33:07.020 --> 33:10.520
That my brother
murdered the governor?

33:10.520 --> 33:12.990
But he was acting outside
the scope of his employment,

33:12.990 --> 33:15.560
which proves that the
company's not liable.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.960
I just don't know
if I can do that.

33:18.960 --> 33:21.000
Here, I prepared your
summation for you.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.330
All you have to do is read it.

33:24.340 --> 33:26.400
I'd like to hear it out loud.

33:32.280 --> 33:34.440
My brother...

33:38.180 --> 33:40.250
...Walt...

33:41.620 --> 33:46.490
...became a bitter,
angry, vengeful man.

33:46.490 --> 33:48.690
Keep reading.

33:52.600 --> 33:55.570
He murdered the governor...

33:55.570 --> 33:57.770
To get back at him.

34:04.110 --> 34:06.040
I-I can't do this.

34:08.010 --> 34:10.210
You have to, Max.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.820
He blamed me.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.489
He thought it was my fault
the company was going under.

34:21.489 --> 34:22.929
He blamed me.

34:22.929 --> 34:24.260
Who did?

34:25.100 --> 34:28.130
Walt.

34:28.130 --> 34:30.929
The airport wasn't
gonna renew the lease.

34:30.940 --> 34:32.940
He assumed that
I screwed it up again,

34:32.940 --> 34:35.639
that I missed a deadline
or something, but I didn't.

34:35.639 --> 34:37.710
It wasn't my fault, it wasn't...

34:40.550 --> 34:43.980
He-he fired me.

34:45.179 --> 34:47.449
I gave 22 years to that company.

34:47.449 --> 34:51.090
I gave 22 years to him.

34:51.090 --> 34:54.690
I gave my whole life!
My whole life!

34:54.690 --> 34:56.790
And it was
governor Whitfield's fault.

34:56.800 --> 34:59.130
It was his fault.

34:59.130 --> 35:00.700
It was all his fault.

35:00.700 --> 35:03.800
And I wanted him to pay.

35:05.100 --> 35:08.640
So I checked to see the next
time that he was gonna be in.

35:08.640 --> 35:11.070
And Walt went through the packs,

35:11.080 --> 35:14.140
and he double and triple checked
everything like he always did.

35:14.150 --> 35:17.180
And after he locked it all up,

35:17.180 --> 35:19.950
I did it, I frayed the cords.

35:30.630 --> 35:32.330
I'm so sorry, honey.

35:37.770 --> 35:40.700
I'm so sorry.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.680
I just want it all to be over.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.310
It's over.

36:00.230 --> 36:03.090
Excuse me, can I have a minute?

36:03.090 --> 36:05.090
No, I think you were right.

36:05.100 --> 36:07.200
I think we should wait
until after the trial.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.170
It's important.

36:09.170 --> 36:11.430
Will you give us a minute?

36:11.440 --> 36:13.770
You should both hear this.

36:13.770 --> 36:16.840
Max Hyland turned himself
in to the police today.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.040
He confessed to
killing your husband.

36:20.950 --> 36:25.850
Dylan is the only person
left at Hyland skydiving.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.180
She's lost her father,
now her uncle.

36:28.190 --> 36:30.790
So I'm asking you,

36:30.790 --> 36:33.260
please don't take away
the only thing she has left

36:33.260 --> 36:35.420
that reminds her of her father.

36:37.200 --> 36:40.500
After everything you've
exposed during this trial?

36:40.500 --> 36:43.270
My husband's
infidelities, corruption?

36:44.100 --> 36:47.870
You've destroyed his legacy.

36:49.710 --> 36:51.410
I know. I'm sorry.

36:51.410 --> 36:55.510
I know this has been
very painful,

36:55.510 --> 36:57.410
but why punish Dylan for that?

36:57.420 --> 37:01.420
Max is going to prison
for the rest of his life.

37:01.420 --> 37:04.220
Walt cared about your husband.

37:04.220 --> 37:06.560
And he died trying
to save his life.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.890
Do you think
you can let go of this

37:08.890 --> 37:10.790
so everyone can move on?

37:10.800 --> 37:13.360
Yes.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.570
Oh, I hope so.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.440
So, about what I said earlier...

37:27.450 --> 37:31.310
I liked seeing this side of you;
She should come out more often.

37:31.320 --> 37:33.020
I'll check her schedule.

37:34.050 --> 37:35.790
You were right.

37:35.790 --> 37:37.350
About what?

37:37.360 --> 37:39.760
Well, I was intrigued
about this case

37:39.760 --> 37:42.790
because you were on it
and I wasn't.

37:42.790 --> 37:44.290
That's worrisome.

37:44.300 --> 37:47.260
Should I expect this challenge
every time I'm on my own case?

37:47.270 --> 37:48.260
Maybe.

37:48.270 --> 37:50.630
Without you,
we don't solve this.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.500
We were looking
in the wrong direction.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.340
You pointed the finger at Walt.

37:54.340 --> 37:56.640
Which was a little heartless,
by the way.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.770
I learned from the best.

38:00.140 --> 38:01.880
I guess we make a good team,

38:01.880 --> 38:04.250
even when
we're on opposing sides.

38:04.250 --> 38:05.310
Hmm.

38:05.320 --> 38:06.580
Until next time.

38:09.690 --> 38:12.090
Liberty, you said you learned
your biggest lesson

38:12.090 --> 38:13.690
from me on this case.

38:13.690 --> 38:15.730
Can you tell me what it was?

38:17.530 --> 38:19.730
How to win.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.940
I brought a peace offering.

38:31.940 --> 38:35.110
Coffee. I can't accept that.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.250
Why not?

38:38.250 --> 38:39.920
Well, I'm on a short leash here.

38:39.920 --> 38:42.990
You give me that, I'm gonna
have to fill out a gift receipt.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.290
Okay.

38:46.290 --> 38:49.090
I'll take it.

38:49.090 --> 38:50.790
But it's mocha mint.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.700
Just don't tell anyone.

38:59.870 --> 39:01.800
I'm really sorry, Rick.

39:01.810 --> 39:04.070
It'll never happen again.

39:10.350 --> 39:14.250
So why didn't you tell me
you broke up with Gabe?

39:14.250 --> 39:16.390
I don't know.

39:16.390 --> 39:19.520
What, you thought I was gonna
ask you out or something?

39:19.520 --> 39:21.920
Would you have asked me out?

39:21.930 --> 39:24.330
I guess we'll never know now.

39:31.900 --> 39:33.940
So you want to grab a drink?

39:40.140 --> 39:41.680
Hey, man.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.510
You good?

39:43.510 --> 39:45.610
Yeah.

39:45.620 --> 39:48.520
I don't know.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.290
You want to talk about it?

39:52.420 --> 39:55.490
Remember the guy
I told you I prosecuted?

39:55.490 --> 39:58.030
Hayden Watkins?

39:59.830 --> 40:01.230
Yeah.

40:01.230 --> 40:02.930
Turns out he may be innocent.

40:06.370 --> 40:07.840
New DNA evidence.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.740
But I thought you said
he was a bad guy.

40:10.740 --> 40:12.740
Thought he was.

40:14.510 --> 40:16.750
How long has he been inside?

40:20.280 --> 40:21.980
Nine years.

40:24.490 --> 40:28.660
His wife... Remarried and...

40:28.660 --> 40:30.860
Started a whole new family.

40:33.930 --> 40:37.170
I may have destroyed
an innocent man's life.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.650
You know this is statistically
safer than cheerleading?

40:57.660 --> 41:00.920
That's my kind of statistic,
but it can't possibly be true.

41:00.930 --> 41:02.420
Look it up.

41:03.630 --> 41:05.130
You don't have to do this.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.700
Yes, I do.

41:08.770 --> 41:10.500
You're the real deal, Dylan.

41:10.500 --> 41:14.540
Your father would want you to
live your life the way he did.

41:14.540 --> 41:16.710
Fearless.

41:18.840 --> 41:21.180
You good?

41:21.180 --> 41:23.150
Ready?

41:23.150 --> 41:24.380
It's safer than cheerleading.

41:38.100 --> 41:42.400
