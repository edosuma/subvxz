WEBVTT

00:01.071 --> 00:02.638
She still isn't answering.

00:02.663 --> 00:04.451
She's probably not allowed
to have her phone

00:04.476 --> 00:05.554
at the poker table.

00:05.579 --> 00:07.538
She shouldn't be at the
poker table at 7:00 a.m.

00:07.563 --> 00:09.592
She should be back with my
car, so I can get to work.

00:09.617 --> 00:11.397
Babe, it's your day off.

00:11.422 --> 00:12.859
From the hospital.

00:12.884 --> 00:14.834
Emily knows I check on the kids
at the homeless encampment.

00:14.859 --> 00:15.984
They count on me.

00:16.009 --> 00:17.250
They'll understand if
you're a few minutes late.

00:17.275 --> 00:18.297
If Emily's gonna live here,

00:18.322 --> 00:19.952
she needs to get her act
together, make a plan.

00:19.977 --> 00:21.968
This isn't some vacation.

00:23.562 --> 00:25.511
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

00:31.220 --> 00:32.819
I've come to recognize

00:32.844 --> 00:36.312
your expressions pretty well.

00:36.337 --> 00:39.305
This one's my least favorite.

00:39.649 --> 00:41.834
I wish I had better news.

00:42.681 --> 00:44.180
But look...

00:44.205 --> 00:47.389
even though your cardiac
output is decreasing,

00:47.414 --> 00:50.141
you are still highest status
on the transplant list.

00:50.166 --> 00:51.265
You're first in line.

00:51.290 --> 00:53.657
I appreciate your optimism,

00:53.682 --> 00:55.473
Dr. Rhodes,

00:55.498 --> 00:57.141
as always.

00:57.367 --> 00:59.515
- Hang in there, Bob.
- Uh-huh.

01:02.873 --> 01:04.206
You know, for my part,

01:04.230 --> 01:06.217
I'm just not seeing any organic causes.

01:06.242 --> 01:08.156
Excuse me, I... Sorry to interrupt.

01:08.181 --> 01:12.084
Um... Sarah, I've just been
up to see your father.

01:12.109 --> 01:15.312
His stroke volume, systolic
arterial pressure,

01:15.337 --> 01:18.338
and pulse pressure have all
decreased since yesterday.

01:18.363 --> 01:21.285
I... I... I just can't keep
the fluid off of his lungs.

01:21.310 --> 01:22.478
I see.

01:22.503 --> 01:25.187
I promise you, we're
doing everything we can

01:25.212 --> 01:27.671
to find him a new heart, but...

01:28.351 --> 01:31.008
if you wanna say good-bye,

01:31.184 --> 01:33.345
I would consider doing it today.

01:33.662 --> 01:35.346
I'm very sorry.

01:35.919 --> 01:37.243
Okay.

01:43.423 --> 01:49.445
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:50.569 --> 01:52.335
- How long have you had a fever?

01:52.360 --> 01:54.030
A few days now.

01:54.055 --> 01:56.033
And are you always this short of breath?

01:56.058 --> 01:57.538
Lately, yeah.

01:57.563 --> 01:59.523
Athena, stop!

01:59.548 --> 02:01.455
Hey, Dr. Choi.

02:01.628 --> 02:03.702
Hey, Deb. Can I take
a look at your legs?

02:03.727 --> 02:05.334
Yeah, sure.

02:06.666 --> 02:08.437
How long have you been
getting these spots?

02:08.461 --> 02:10.829
- Why? Are they bad?
- I'm not sure...

02:10.854 --> 02:12.671
but I'd like to prick your
finger to check your blood.

02:12.696 --> 02:14.156
Okay, yeah.

02:16.351 --> 02:19.133
All right.

02:21.523 --> 02:24.123
Ethan, I know, I'm sorry,
I promised I'd be home,

02:24.148 --> 02:25.692
but I had half the table on tilt,

02:25.717 --> 02:27.156
and I just lost track of time.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.374
Whatever. Take the car. I'll get a cab.

02:29.602 --> 02:31.602
I'm not gonna just leave you here.

02:31.627 --> 02:33.226
What can I do to help?

02:33.251 --> 02:35.217
I don't want your help.

02:35.260 --> 02:37.577
Ethan, you don't have to be like that.

02:37.714 --> 02:39.493
He doesn't have to be like that.

02:39.739 --> 02:41.625
Hi. Emily.

02:41.650 --> 02:43.145
- Josh.
- Nice to meet you.

02:43.170 --> 02:45.179
- Uh, cute dog.
- Thank you.

02:45.204 --> 02:47.306
- What kinda tent do you use?
- Uh, it's an old Coleman.

02:47.331 --> 02:49.131
- Has a rain fly.
- Nice.

02:50.140 --> 02:51.840
Hold on.

02:53.330 --> 02:56.431
Josh... I'm seeing some
cells in your blood

02:56.457 --> 02:58.228
called lymphoblasts.

02:58.253 --> 03:01.260
That plus your other symptoms
make me concerned enough

03:01.285 --> 03:03.328
that I'd like to bring
you into the hospital.

03:03.353 --> 03:04.698
Why? What do you think it is?

03:04.723 --> 03:06.956
It could be all sorts of things...

03:07.093 --> 03:09.193
but what I'm worried about is leukemia.

03:09.297 --> 03:11.502
- Isn't that a kind of cancer?
- It is.

03:11.527 --> 03:13.307
Josh, this is important.

03:13.332 --> 03:15.799
Look, I mean, Athena needs me out here.

03:15.824 --> 03:16.979
And if I go back with you,

03:17.004 --> 03:18.283
you're gonna have to call my parents,

03:18.308 --> 03:20.346
the people that adopted me,

03:20.406 --> 03:22.373
and I don't think I want that.

03:22.446 --> 03:25.313
- Did they mistreat you?
- No, no, no, they're okay.

03:25.338 --> 03:27.166
It's just, uh...

03:27.191 --> 03:30.092
things didn't really work
out with them, you know?

03:30.250 --> 03:33.094
You don't have to call
his parents, right?

03:33.119 --> 03:34.757
Em...

03:34.787 --> 03:36.287
Is that true?

03:36.579 --> 03:38.284
You're only 16.

03:38.309 --> 03:40.479
Legally, they need to be notified.

03:40.597 --> 03:43.057
I mean, if his life is on the line,

03:43.272 --> 03:45.309
you could make an exception.

03:45.521 --> 03:47.455
I mean, if you could do that,
I'm sure I could get Deb

03:47.480 --> 03:50.189
to watch Athena, if it's
just for the afternoon.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.150
We could run some tests first,

03:53.175 --> 03:55.175
make sure we know what's going on.

03:55.208 --> 03:56.534
Hey, Deb,

03:56.559 --> 03:58.369
could I ask you a favor?

03:59.097 --> 04:00.926
You shouldn't have done that.

04:00.951 --> 04:02.712
Eventually I'm gonna have
to call his parents.

04:02.737 --> 04:04.448
What are you busting on me for?

04:04.473 --> 04:06.127
Got him to come in, didn't I?

04:13.517 --> 04:15.150
Wow.

04:15.175 --> 04:17.367
One of our patients is well loved.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.632
Actually, they came for me.

04:20.206 --> 04:22.173
- Really?
- Mm.

04:22.198 --> 04:25.182
The enchanting Dr. Bekker.

04:27.525 --> 04:29.024
What?

04:30.672 --> 04:33.273
Uh, seems they're from your father.

04:33.404 --> 04:35.859
- My father?
- Yeah.

04:38.218 --> 04:41.073
Uh, you've been seeing him?

04:41.312 --> 04:43.012
Is, uh... is that a problem?

04:43.037 --> 04:44.219
No, no, it's not a problem.

04:44.244 --> 04:47.289
Just... uh, he's just...

04:51.102 --> 04:52.534
You know what, forget it.

04:52.825 --> 04:54.792
Enjoy the flowers.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:05.077 --> 05:06.852
Are you two still at it?

05:06.877 --> 05:08.576
At what?

05:08.860 --> 05:10.414
I've barely seen you speak two words

05:10.439 --> 05:11.937
to each other in a week.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.254
Whatever this is, you
need to work it out.

05:14.286 --> 05:16.592
- Everything's fine.
- Oh, everything's fine?

05:16.617 --> 05:17.899
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

05:17.924 --> 05:19.492
Dr. Manning, Dr. Halstead,

05:19.517 --> 05:21.417
you're up, Treatment Four.

05:23.821 --> 05:25.221
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:25.246 --> 05:27.468
Kevin Parks: He's ten years old.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.741
He woke up with 8 out
of 10 abdominal pain

05:29.766 --> 05:31.180
and a fever of 103.

05:31.205 --> 05:32.780
We gave him Tylenol and a cool bath,

05:32.805 --> 05:34.539
- but nothing's worked.
- Okay.

05:34.564 --> 05:36.897
All right, Kevin, let's
get you up on the bed.

05:36.988 --> 05:39.356
Ow, ow. That hurts.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.914
- That hurts? All right.
- All right, you got it.

05:41.939 --> 05:44.664
- We're gonna figure out why.
- There you go.

05:44.969 --> 05:47.061
Hi, Kevin, I'm Dr. Manning.
This is Dr. Halstead.

05:47.086 --> 05:49.309
Can you show us where it hurts?

05:49.334 --> 05:51.518
- Right here?
- Right there? Okay.

05:51.955 --> 05:54.055
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

05:54.080 --> 05:55.898
No, never.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.130
Abdomen is tender but not rigid,

05:58.171 --> 06:00.138
with no rebound.

06:00.171 --> 06:01.905
Bowel sounds are decreased.
I don't like it.

06:01.930 --> 06:03.749
It could still be his
appendix, Crohn's disease,

06:03.774 --> 06:05.584
ulcerative colitis.

06:05.609 --> 06:07.493
Temp's up to 104.

06:07.518 --> 06:10.120
Give Ibuprofen to start
cooling measures.

06:10.469 --> 06:12.569
Is there any other medical
history we should be aware of?

06:12.583 --> 06:15.219
Yes, he's been diagnosed with PANDAS.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.430
PANDAS?

06:16.455 --> 06:18.765
Uh, Pediatric Autoimmune
Neuropsychiatric Disorder

06:18.790 --> 06:20.657
Associated with Streptococcal Infection.

06:20.682 --> 06:22.866
Kevin started getting tics and OCD

06:22.891 --> 06:24.875
after a strep infection two years ago.

06:24.900 --> 06:27.016
Nobody else could
figure out what it was,

06:27.041 --> 06:29.414
until finally Dr. Kravitz diagnosed him.

06:29.439 --> 06:31.339
Okay, we'll be sure to give him a call.

06:31.364 --> 06:32.809
I've heard of Dr. Kravitz.

06:32.834 --> 06:34.561
He sees a lot of kids
with PANDAS, right?

06:34.586 --> 06:36.367
He's one of the nation's top experts.

06:36.392 --> 06:37.704
I'm guessing Dr. Kravitz put Kevin

06:37.729 --> 06:39.718
on long-term prophylactic antibiotics

06:39.743 --> 06:41.008
to fight the residual strep?

06:41.033 --> 06:42.236
Yes, he did.

06:42.261 --> 06:44.242
CBC, chem panel, blood cultures,

06:44.267 --> 06:46.866
abdominal CT, and hang
a gram of vanco STAT.

06:46.891 --> 06:48.760
We're gonna start him
on some medications

06:48.785 --> 06:49.891
while we run some tests

06:49.916 --> 06:51.325
to try to figure out
what's going on, okay?

06:51.350 --> 06:53.198
We'll be back to check on him shortly.

06:53.223 --> 06:54.656
Thank you.

06:58.405 --> 07:00.382
Hey, you've heard of this Dr. Kravitz.

07:00.407 --> 07:01.702
He labels every kid's

07:01.727 --> 07:03.664
neurological condition as PANDAS.

07:03.689 --> 07:06.289
It's not even an officially
recognized diagnosis.

07:06.331 --> 07:07.586
Either way, right now,

07:07.611 --> 07:09.821
that child is in real
pain with a real fever.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.030
Right, because he's been on
three different antibiotics

07:12.055 --> 07:13.375
for over 12 months,

07:13.400 --> 07:14.742
which we both know has wiped out

07:14.767 --> 07:16.180
all the healthy flora in his gut,

07:16.205 --> 07:18.606
causing a massive superinfection.

07:18.966 --> 07:21.366
I mean, all because his parents
shopped around for a doctor

07:21.391 --> 07:24.141
willing to blame Kevin's
neurologic tics on strep,

07:24.166 --> 07:25.156
instead of admitting

07:25.181 --> 07:27.045
they most likely passed
it on to him genetically.

07:27.070 --> 07:28.694
Okay, but dismissing
them isn't gonna help.

07:28.719 --> 07:30.538
They are upset and worried.

07:30.563 --> 07:31.766
And what they're doing
to try and fix him

07:31.798 --> 07:33.579
might wind up killing him.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.944
Dr. Sexton, Treatment Six is open.

07:35.969 --> 07:36.938
You're up.

07:36.963 --> 07:38.812
We got Frank Larson: 74.

07:38.837 --> 07:40.570
He was found unconscious
in an abandoned warehouse.

07:40.595 --> 07:42.891
Bradycardic at 45, BP's 90 over 60,

07:42.916 --> 07:45.532
respiration's 10, and satting at 91%.

07:45.557 --> 07:47.342
Mr. Larson, do you know where you are?

07:48.329 --> 07:50.912
Let's move him on one, two, three.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.746
Dad? Dad, what happened?

08:01.771 --> 08:03.039
Is he... is he all right?

08:03.064 --> 08:04.148
That's what we're trying to figure out.

08:04.173 --> 08:06.593
Frank, can you hear me?
Can you hear me Frank?

08:06.618 --> 08:08.297
He... he... he goes around
feeding the stray cats,

08:08.322 --> 08:10.272
but he has dementia and he gets lost.

08:10.297 --> 08:11.586
Does he have any other
medical conditions?

08:11.611 --> 08:14.210
No. You're the one examining him.

08:14.235 --> 08:16.679
- What do you think it could be?
- It's hard to say right now.

08:16.704 --> 08:19.234
We need to let the
doctor run some tests.

08:19.259 --> 08:21.584
It looks like he doesn't
have any injuries,

08:21.609 --> 08:23.477
but yes, I would like
to run some more tests

08:23.502 --> 08:25.374
- to figure out what's going on.
- Okay.

08:25.399 --> 08:26.594
- Okay?
- Okay.

08:26.618 --> 08:29.018
Dad, I'll be right here, okay?

08:29.043 --> 08:30.623
I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.

08:30.648 --> 08:32.548
- Sorry. Big sister moment.
- Yep.

08:32.573 --> 08:34.482
Anyway, let's get an EKG,

08:34.508 --> 08:36.842
CBC, chem panels, troponins,

08:36.868 --> 08:39.500
tox screens, and a head CT.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.563
We'll figure this out.

08:46.321 --> 08:48.488
Dr. Reese, I was just, um...

08:48.513 --> 08:50.523
I was just heading up to...

08:50.548 --> 08:52.481
To check on your dad.

08:52.517 --> 08:54.183
Okay.

08:56.531 --> 08:58.556
Listen, I, um...

08:58.980 --> 09:01.647
I know you've had a very
complicated relationship,

09:01.672 --> 09:04.109
and this is really none of my business,

09:04.134 --> 09:08.278
but... I think that if he should die

09:08.303 --> 09:10.425
before you have a
chance to speak to him,

09:11.006 --> 09:13.779
that that could very
possibly be something

09:13.804 --> 09:15.540
you would come to regret.

09:15.565 --> 09:18.734
My father... Has clearly stated

09:18.759 --> 09:21.233
that he doesn't want me
to be a part of his life,

09:21.258 --> 09:25.594
so, uh, whatever regrets I may have...

09:26.444 --> 09:28.440
I just don't think any
of them will be resolved

09:28.465 --> 09:29.727
by me talking to him.

09:29.752 --> 09:31.785
Okay.

09:37.347 --> 09:39.955
You, uh... you accepting visitors?

09:40.388 --> 09:42.023
It depends.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.981
Is it professional...

09:44.110 --> 09:45.776
or is it personal?

09:46.110 --> 09:48.781
Uh... personal?

09:48.839 --> 09:50.461
Then by all means.

09:52.327 --> 09:54.461
I, um...

09:54.817 --> 09:57.547
I heard about your situation. Mm.

09:57.727 --> 09:59.960
Really so sorry that it's come to this.

09:59.985 --> 10:01.766
Yeah, what can I say?

10:03.616 --> 10:06.835
It's been kind of a chess
game between the two of us,

10:06.860 --> 10:08.766
hasn't it?

10:08.819 --> 10:10.652
I regret that you see it that way.

10:10.805 --> 10:12.905
Uh... uh, I would hope that you would...

10:12.930 --> 10:15.102
Ha.

10:15.127 --> 10:16.593
It's ironic.

10:18.577 --> 10:21.811
You made me cut Sarah out of my life

10:21.836 --> 10:23.679
to get a heart,

10:23.704 --> 10:25.686
and I end up with neither.

10:25.711 --> 10:28.523
Robert, it was never my intention

10:28.548 --> 10:30.305
to have you cut Sarah out of your life.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.382
Semantics.

10:32.695 --> 10:35.052
Uh, in any case...

10:35.497 --> 10:37.594
you play a good game.

10:49.853 --> 10:51.654
Dr. Bekker...

10:52.315 --> 10:55.252
- You're looking lovely.
- Thank you.

10:55.376 --> 10:57.492
And thank you for the flowers.

10:57.517 --> 10:59.079
That was quite unnecessary.

10:59.104 --> 11:00.881
Did you like them?

11:01.115 --> 11:02.603
They're beautiful.

11:02.699 --> 11:04.505
Though, I must admit, the money
would've been better spent

11:04.568 --> 11:07.302
as part of your donation
to the department.

11:07.327 --> 11:09.563
Speaking of which, I glanced
at that information

11:09.588 --> 11:11.103
you gave me concerning...

11:11.128 --> 11:12.757
Da Vinci robotic surgical system?

11:12.782 --> 11:15.024
Yes, that's, uh... It
was very impressive,

11:15.049 --> 11:18.156
but a little technical for
a layman like myself.

11:18.181 --> 11:20.197
Perhaps you could explain
the details to me?

11:20.222 --> 11:22.489
- Of course.
- How 'bout tonight?

11:23.991 --> 11:25.977
Over dinner?

11:29.492 --> 11:31.191
Mr. Rhodes...

11:31.239 --> 11:33.595
the flowers? Dinner?

11:33.620 --> 11:36.634
Is it me or are you trying
to make your son crazy?

11:36.659 --> 11:39.806
Dr. Bekker... you are...

11:40.101 --> 11:42.202
an intelligent...

11:42.453 --> 11:44.853
attractive, dynamic woman,

11:45.144 --> 11:48.087
and if this makes Connor crazy,

11:48.112 --> 11:50.244
then so be it.

11:50.791 --> 11:54.329
Look, I and the entire
cardiothoracic department

11:54.354 --> 11:57.040
truly appreciate your patronage,

11:57.228 --> 11:59.367
but you and I are going
to keep our relationship

11:59.392 --> 12:01.471
on a professional level.

12:01.587 --> 12:03.969
Oh... all right.

12:03.994 --> 12:05.359
I'll have the head of
philanthropy services

12:05.384 --> 12:06.884
give you a call this afternoon.

12:06.909 --> 12:08.375
Thank you.

12:12.270 --> 12:14.442
- Dr. Rhodes, Trauma Three.
- Yep.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.583
All right, Brett, what do we got?

12:15.608 --> 12:17.091
David Gray: 50-year-old bystander

12:17.116 --> 12:18.215
in an attempted robbery.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.144
He got shot in the head. GCS, 6.

12:20.169 --> 12:21.823
He's only responding to painful stimuli.

12:21.848 --> 12:23.044
We couldn't intubate in the field.

12:23.069 --> 12:24.262
All right, give me an intubation kit.

12:24.287 --> 12:27.086
- 150 of mannitol, 500 of keppra.
- Got it.

12:30.290 --> 12:32.156
All right, on my count,

12:32.181 --> 12:34.448
one, two, three.

12:38.333 --> 12:41.067
Entry wound, left
parietal skull, no exit.

12:41.092 --> 12:42.754
Get a neurosurg down here ASAP.

12:42.779 --> 12:44.763
- And get me a Cordis kit.
- Yep.

12:45.810 --> 12:48.177
There we go.

12:49.346 --> 12:51.396
No reactions to light.

12:54.043 --> 12:55.901
All right, I'm in.

12:56.637 --> 12:58.651
No corneal reflex either.
We're losing him.

12:58.676 --> 13:00.655
Cordis kit.

13:01.255 --> 13:03.389
Brainstem reflexes are
completely absent,

13:03.414 --> 13:05.012
and his pupils are fixed and blown.

13:05.161 --> 13:07.028
He was responding to pain in the ambo.

13:07.061 --> 13:08.670
Dr. Rhodes, he's GCS 3.

13:12.046 --> 13:14.637
Dr. Rhodes, he's braindead.
Is he a donor?

13:18.082 --> 13:19.515
Yeah.

13:19.540 --> 13:22.378
Okay... let's get an angio
to confirm brain death,

13:22.403 --> 13:23.714
then get a cardiac echo.

13:23.739 --> 13:25.519
I've got a patient who needs a heart.

13:25.544 --> 13:27.207
You're wasting your time
on this one, Dr. Rhodes.

13:27.232 --> 13:29.950
I heard significant mitral
regurg on auscultation.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.675
There's no way that heart is viable.

13:31.700 --> 13:34.240
Maybe not now, but that
doesn't mean I can't fix it.

13:34.642 --> 13:36.386
Let's get him up to Radiology now.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.519
- A drug overdose?
- Opioids.

13:46.544 --> 13:48.933
Your father's tox screen
showed extremely high levels.

13:48.958 --> 13:51.153
Bolus him with 2 of narcan,
then start a drip.

13:51.248 --> 13:53.706
It can't be. My dad doesn't do drugs.

13:53.731 --> 13:55.957
I mean, he... he never has. He...
he doesn't even drink.

13:55.982 --> 13:58.971
- What about pain medication?
- He doesn't take anything.

13:58.996 --> 14:00.848
You need to run some more tests.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.809
Ma'am, Dr. Sexton has run
all the appropriate...

14:02.834 --> 14:05.894
Is there anything around the house?

14:05.919 --> 14:08.464
Um, Vicodin? Tylenol with codeine?

14:08.489 --> 14:10.133
No, I... I cleaned all the
medicine cabinets out.

14:10.158 --> 14:11.653
We don't have anything.

14:11.678 --> 14:14.145
Hmm, then he may have gotten
it outside the house.

14:14.170 --> 14:16.512
What? You think I'm letting
him shoot up or something?

14:16.537 --> 14:18.908
- No, I'm just saying...
- Look, your test is wrong.

14:18.933 --> 14:20.301
You need to redo it.

14:22.468 --> 14:24.835
These tests, they are
usually pretty accurate...

14:24.860 --> 14:27.242
And I know my father.

14:27.685 --> 14:29.519
Look, if you need to consult
with another doctor,

14:29.544 --> 14:31.481
- then maybe...
- No.

14:32.271 --> 14:33.770
I'll redo the test.

14:33.795 --> 14:35.371
But in the meantime,

14:35.396 --> 14:36.636
I'm gonna give him some medicine

14:36.661 --> 14:37.949
to reverse the opioids,

14:37.996 --> 14:40.380
just so we can try and wake him up.

14:41.111 --> 14:43.712
- Okay.
- Thanks.

14:43.737 --> 14:45.567
Administer the narcan.

14:53.540 --> 14:55.364
Hi.

14:55.762 --> 14:59.019
So, Kevin's scans
indicate toxic megacolon.

14:59.128 --> 15:00.995
It's a dangerous intestinal infection

15:01.020 --> 15:03.487
caused by an overgrowth of
opportunistic bacteria.

15:03.512 --> 15:06.387
Which is most likely due to
his long-term antibiotic use.

15:06.412 --> 15:08.879
So the new medicine you're
giving him should fix it?

15:08.990 --> 15:10.590
It's not that simple.

15:10.615 --> 15:12.715
Kevin's bowel is so inflamed,

15:12.740 --> 15:14.418
it's become dangerously dilated.

15:14.443 --> 15:16.995
And if it perforates, it's a
life threatening situation,

15:17.020 --> 15:19.480
which is why we need to release
the pressure from his colon

15:19.512 --> 15:21.546
to try and prevent that.

15:21.855 --> 15:23.488
We appreciate your help,

15:23.513 --> 15:25.713
but we've spoken with Dr. Kravitz,

15:25.738 --> 15:27.742
and he wants Kevin
transferred over there.

15:27.767 --> 15:30.293
Dr. Kravitz says if we
treat him incorrectly,

15:30.318 --> 15:32.701
it's only going to make Kevin's
neurologic symptoms worse.

15:32.726 --> 15:34.581
He wants to give him an infusion of IVlg

15:34.606 --> 15:35.637
to prevent that.

15:35.662 --> 15:38.059
Kevin's tics are the least
of his problems right now.

15:38.199 --> 15:40.433
We need to focus on
treating his infection.

15:40.458 --> 15:41.543
We want that too,

15:41.568 --> 15:43.778
but Kevin's tics are a big problem.

15:44.086 --> 15:46.537
They're odd, and the kids at school

15:46.562 --> 15:48.097
are starting to stare at him.

15:48.122 --> 15:49.543
We just don't wanna do anything

15:49.568 --> 15:51.692
- to compromise his future.
- I understand, but...

15:51.717 --> 15:53.590
We'll do the IVig here.

15:53.615 --> 15:55.015
Natalie...

15:55.040 --> 15:56.762
That would work.

15:56.787 --> 15:58.387
Great, we'll get started right away.

15:58.412 --> 16:00.377
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

16:02.124 --> 16:03.623
Why are you indulging them like this?

16:03.648 --> 16:04.732
Indulging them?

16:04.757 --> 16:06.924
You know full well the IVlg

16:06.974 --> 16:09.199
will have exactly zero
therapeutic benefit.

16:09.224 --> 16:10.379
It's keeping Kevin in the hospital.

16:10.404 --> 16:12.332
Why are you being so negative?

16:12.481 --> 16:13.778
I'm just being realistic.

16:13.803 --> 16:16.332
The more you humor then, the
less likely they'll ever be

16:16.357 --> 16:17.923
to seek out an actual effective therapy

16:17.948 --> 16:20.762
for what is most likely a
genetic neurologic condition.

16:20.787 --> 16:22.082
So what do you want me to do, Will?

16:22.107 --> 16:23.941
Have them sign out and leave?

16:23.966 --> 16:26.653
- Nah, you should just
give them a placebo: IVlg.

16:26.677 --> 16:28.410
If that's what's gonna
allow us to do our job,

16:28.435 --> 16:30.949
then that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

16:33.504 --> 16:35.098
Just a little bit longer.

16:35.123 --> 16:36.490
I need to get back to Athena.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.362
I'm still waiting on a few more tests,

16:38.387 --> 16:40.654
so please, don't go anywhere yet.

16:48.047 --> 16:49.718
Dr. Charles...

16:50.407 --> 16:52.774
I've got a runaway kid
with confirmed leukemia,

16:52.799 --> 16:54.041
but I can't get him to give me

16:54.066 --> 16:55.641
his parents' contact information,

16:55.666 --> 16:57.688
and Oncology won't begin treatment

16:57.713 --> 16:59.134
till they're sure he's
not gonna be living

16:59.166 --> 17:00.930
in a tent on the streets
during his recovery.

17:00.955 --> 17:03.127
Figure his parents
might have abused him?

17:03.298 --> 17:04.730
Apparently not.

17:04.755 --> 17:06.579
He's adopted, but he says
they're nice people.

17:06.605 --> 17:08.127
It just wasn't a good fit.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.345
And you're sure he
understands the danger here?

17:10.369 --> 17:12.729
Cancer? Life or death?

17:13.079 --> 17:16.035
Says he does, but I don't know.

17:16.175 --> 17:18.964
- Let me have a chat with him.
- Thanks.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.023
There's too much retrograde flow.

17:24.049 --> 17:26.282
The leaflet's totally eaten away.

17:26.692 --> 17:28.676
Shame to have an otherwise
perfectly good heart

17:28.701 --> 17:29.766
go to waste.

17:29.791 --> 17:31.517
It's not gonna go to waste.

17:31.591 --> 17:32.838
Excuse me?

17:32.863 --> 17:36.259
This heart is an HLA
match for my patient.

17:36.364 --> 17:37.933
I'm gonna do a valve repair.

17:37.958 --> 17:39.400
You're joking.

17:39.652 --> 17:41.977
Get him prepped for surgery, thanks.

17:45.342 --> 17:48.744
You're going to do major
surgery on this heart,

17:48.768 --> 17:50.609
which by itself contains
significant morbidity

17:50.635 --> 17:52.579
and mortality, and then turn around

17:52.604 --> 17:54.064
and transplant it into someone else?

17:54.089 --> 17:55.574
Uh-huh.

17:55.599 --> 17:57.733
You'll kill the recipient on the table.

17:57.958 --> 17:59.621
So don't scrub in.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.430
I'm sure with your active social life,

18:01.455 --> 18:03.213
there are things you'd
rather be doing anyways.

18:03.238 --> 18:04.538
Now, if you will excuse me,

18:04.563 --> 18:08.004
I am going to prep for my valve repair.

18:15.587 --> 18:17.203
Ms. Larson...

18:17.228 --> 18:20.884
the retests once again show
high levels of opioids.

18:20.986 --> 18:22.330
I'm sorry.

18:22.355 --> 18:23.782
Well, then why isn't he waking up?

18:23.807 --> 18:25.556
Should we be doing something else?

18:25.581 --> 18:27.766
Well, with overdoses that
large, it can sometimes...

18:27.791 --> 18:29.234
Dr. Sexton...

18:34.183 --> 18:36.216
Okay, um, we need to step out.

18:36.241 --> 18:37.354
Let's clear the room.

18:37.522 --> 18:39.604
- Wha... what's going on?
- Step out.

18:39.936 --> 18:41.936
That white powder on his jacket,

18:42.291 --> 18:44.205
I'm guessing that's fentanyl.

18:44.230 --> 18:45.971
- What's that?
- A synthetic opiate.

18:45.996 --> 18:48.101
Now, he could have either inhaled it

18:48.126 --> 18:49.914
or even just touched it,

18:49.939 --> 18:51.752
but it's 100 times stronger than heroin.

18:51.777 --> 18:54.196
That could explain why the
narcan's moving so slow.

18:54.221 --> 18:55.580
But how did he get it?

18:55.605 --> 18:57.064
They smuggle it in from China

18:57.096 --> 18:58.299
and cut it in abandoned buildings.

18:58.324 --> 19:00.091
All your dad had to do was
brush up against some

19:00.116 --> 19:01.649
while he was feeding stray cats.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.258
We're notifying CPD, CFD,

19:03.283 --> 19:04.729
anyone who might've come in contact,

19:04.754 --> 19:07.728
Now, um, you have to test it,
but I think we have fentanyl.

19:07.869 --> 19:09.584
Okay, I'll set up the decon protocol

19:09.609 --> 19:11.013
out in the ambulance bay,
and I'll call Goodwin.

19:11.038 --> 19:12.018
- Doris, door.
- Okay, got it.

19:12.043 --> 19:14.127
We will get you back in the
room, but please come.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.385
You gotta strip.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.795
I feel fine. Come on, Maggie.

19:39.820 --> 19:41.211
You come on.

19:41.236 --> 19:42.904
Even absorbed through the
skin, fentanyl can cause

19:42.929 --> 19:45.491
mental status changes and
respiratory distress.

19:45.516 --> 19:47.936
- Strip.
- She's right, Cesar.

19:47.961 --> 19:49.814
Go get some clean clothes.

19:50.516 --> 19:52.617
I don't like this at all, Maggie.

19:52.642 --> 19:55.936
We got too many sick people
in here to take any chances.

19:55.961 --> 19:58.687
We need to scrub down the
back half of the ED,

19:58.712 --> 20:01.233
and put us on bypass until
we get the go-ahead

20:01.258 --> 20:03.085
from the decontamination team.

20:03.110 --> 20:04.702
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

20:10.479 --> 20:11.812
All finished.

20:11.837 --> 20:13.633
You okay, Kevin?

20:13.776 --> 20:15.242
Can I have a word?

20:20.070 --> 20:23.456
Kevin's latest scans
show increasing edema

20:23.481 --> 20:24.990
across the wall of his bowel,

20:25.015 --> 20:26.889
indicating lack of blood flow.

20:26.914 --> 20:29.663
At this point, we need to
consider surgical resection.

20:29.688 --> 20:30.460
Surgery?

20:30.485 --> 20:31.937
Shouldn't we finish the IVig first

20:31.962 --> 20:33.404
to see if it helps?

20:33.431 --> 20:34.577
He can keep getting it,

20:34.602 --> 20:36.318
but we really need to move him upstairs.

20:36.343 --> 20:37.851
We need to call Dr. Kravitz.

20:37.876 --> 20:40.502
Mr. and Mrs. Parks, your son
is running out of time.

20:40.527 --> 20:42.014
My wife works tirelessly

20:42.039 --> 20:43.679
to try to fix our son's problems,

20:43.704 --> 20:45.871
and if she has any hesitation at all,

20:45.896 --> 20:47.499
then we need to listen to her.

20:47.524 --> 20:48.964
How 'bout I call Dr. Kravitz

20:48.989 --> 20:50.570
and explain the situation to him, okay?

20:50.595 --> 20:52.866
- Could you do that?
- Of course.

20:52.891 --> 20:55.922
- Is there a bathroom nearby?
- Right down the hall.

20:57.374 --> 20:59.180
So, you're just gonna
keep encouraging them

20:59.205 --> 21:00.491
to follow this quack?

21:00.516 --> 21:02.929
Now is not the time to start
an argument with them.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.598
You know, it must be
nice always being right.

21:05.623 --> 21:07.016
Sorry?

21:07.041 --> 21:08.679
From the moment we started this case,

21:08.704 --> 21:10.770
everything's been your way.

21:10.804 --> 21:12.748
"We can't do this, we have to do that."

21:12.773 --> 21:14.179
What are you talking about?

21:14.204 --> 21:16.483
I'm talking about everything
always being done your way:

21:16.508 --> 21:17.554
how we treat patients,

21:17.579 --> 21:19.070
what we can or can't tell them...

21:19.095 --> 21:19.898
What?

21:19.923 --> 21:21.562
Whether you and I are
together or split up

21:21.587 --> 21:22.453
or on a break.

21:22.478 --> 21:24.518
Is that what this is about? You and me?

21:24.543 --> 21:25.865
Because it definitely wasn't my idea

21:25.890 --> 21:27.929
to go hook up with some woman in a bar.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.998
I told you, it went nowhere.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.437
Oh, and that's supposed
to make me feel better?

21:31.462 --> 21:32.628
I made a mistake.

21:32.653 --> 21:34.627
I'm not perfect.

21:34.652 --> 21:36.618
But at least I admit it.

21:36.865 --> 21:38.740
I don't think I'm perfect.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.928
Okay, all I can say, Natalie,
is that it's very hard

21:40.953 --> 21:43.327
for us mere mortals
to measure up to you.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.433
Thanks, Officer Burgess,
I appreciate your help.

21:50.730 --> 21:52.196
What are you still doing here?

21:52.221 --> 21:53.748
I wanted to see how Josh is doing.

21:53.773 --> 21:55.039
He's not letting us treat him.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.731
Luckily, PD's got a lead on his parents.

21:56.808 --> 21:58.908
Wait, you said you weren't
going to call his parents.

21:58.933 --> 22:00.765
I said I'd end up calling
them eventually.

22:00.790 --> 22:01.999
Yeah, but you don't have to.

22:02.024 --> 22:03.039
I mean, there are other ways to do this.

22:03.064 --> 22:04.576
This is what Josh needs to stay alive.

22:04.601 --> 22:06.162
You don't know what Josh needs.

22:06.187 --> 22:08.562
And you do?

22:08.587 --> 22:10.663
Look, you're not adopted.

22:11.087 --> 22:13.040
You don't know what it's like.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.295
Josh needs a bone marrow transplant,

22:16.320 --> 22:18.412
and he won't get it if he's
living on the streets.

22:18.437 --> 22:20.633
So you're just gonna
do whatever you want?

22:21.015 --> 22:23.412
Yeah, because you always
know better than everyone.

22:23.437 --> 22:24.867
No, I don't,

22:24.892 --> 22:26.406
but I do know that
when his immune system

22:26.431 --> 22:28.721
is obliterated by chemo,
he's gonna need to recover

22:28.746 --> 22:30.279
in a stable, clean environment,

22:30.304 --> 22:32.382
and if you're too irresponsible
to understand that,

22:32.407 --> 22:34.979
then stay out of my way.

22:47.185 --> 22:49.020
Mrs. Parks?

22:49.045 --> 22:51.913
I'm sorry, I was just finishing up.

22:53.167 --> 22:55.333
Are you all right?

22:58.770 --> 23:01.856
I'm just stressed.

23:02.228 --> 23:04.528
- Does that help?
- What?

23:04.812 --> 23:06.245
The handwashing.

23:10.382 --> 23:12.516
It used to...

23:12.633 --> 23:14.602
in high school,

23:14.909 --> 23:18.314
but I stopped for a long
time, till Kevin got sick.

23:18.972 --> 23:21.255
Having a child with uncontrollable tics

23:21.280 --> 23:23.152
must be so stressful.

23:23.177 --> 23:24.977
That's why we've seen so many doctors.

23:25.002 --> 23:28.170
My husband likes answers.

23:28.272 --> 23:30.034
Does he know about this?

23:30.431 --> 23:32.398
He's already got enough
that he didn't sign up for.

23:32.423 --> 23:33.823
What would be the point?

23:33.848 --> 23:36.481
It might help you and Kevin.

23:36.506 --> 23:38.340
I don't see how.

23:38.365 --> 23:41.511
Kathy, you have OCD, like Kevin,

23:41.536 --> 23:43.982
and it's not caused by
any bacterial infection.

23:44.007 --> 23:45.013
It's genetic,

23:45.038 --> 23:48.052
something a child inherits
from the parents.

23:49.608 --> 23:52.014
I appreciate your concern,

23:52.039 --> 23:53.641
but please,

23:53.730 --> 23:55.663
just take care of Kevin's intestines.

23:55.688 --> 23:57.154
I'll worry about the rest.

24:13.170 --> 24:15.191
Excuse me, are you all right?

24:15.396 --> 24:17.363
Um, sorry, I'm... I'm fine.

24:17.388 --> 24:18.933
I'm Dr. Reese from Psychiatry.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.300
Can I help?

24:20.325 --> 24:22.036
Uh...

24:22.061 --> 24:25.214
my dad ran into some trouble today.

24:25.643 --> 24:27.419
He has dementia.

24:27.444 --> 24:31.095
Oh, I'm sorry. I know
that's really hard.

24:33.661 --> 24:35.808
It's completely normal

24:35.833 --> 24:37.726
to feel overwhelmed.

24:38.372 --> 24:41.063
It's like he's a different person.

24:43.416 --> 24:46.319
And sometimes, I wonder if maybe...

24:49.552 --> 24:52.024
If maybe it would be better if he...

24:53.972 --> 24:56.455
Does that make me a horrible person?

24:57.104 --> 24:58.745
No.

24:58.817 --> 25:00.717
No, it doesn't make you horrible.

25:00.742 --> 25:03.567
Almost anyone in your position
would have these thoughts.

25:14.552 --> 25:16.654
Talked to your patient. Nice kid.

25:16.679 --> 25:18.457
Is he still insisting on

25:18.482 --> 25:20.231
going back to the homeless encampment?

25:20.256 --> 25:21.865
He feels pretty strongly about it.

25:21.890 --> 25:23.083
Is he suicidal?

25:23.108 --> 25:25.242
Nope, he definitely seems to wanna live.

25:25.267 --> 25:27.465
Then he shouldn't object so
much to me calling his parents.

25:27.490 --> 25:29.388
I need to spend a little
more time with him,

25:29.425 --> 25:30.380
but off the top of my head,

25:30.405 --> 25:32.449
I'd say that Josh is dealing with

25:32.474 --> 25:35.052
a classic case of attachment disorder.

25:35.077 --> 25:37.287
Does that explain why
he'd rather risk his life

25:37.312 --> 25:38.888
than live with his parents
for a couple of months?

25:38.913 --> 25:40.302
I know it seems bizarre,

25:40.327 --> 25:41.960
but those two years that
he was at the orphanage,

25:41.985 --> 25:43.318
it's that critical period

25:43.343 --> 25:46.575
when babies need parental
affection the most.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.380
And if they're in a facility
where they don't get it,

25:48.405 --> 25:50.825
their brains actually
become wired differently,

25:51.068 --> 25:54.144
leaving them poorly adapted
to cope with the complexities

25:54.169 --> 25:56.716
of giving and receiving love,

25:56.741 --> 25:59.041
I mean, sometimes for the
rest of their lives.

26:00.095 --> 26:02.296
I hear what you're saying, Dr.
Charles...

26:03.567 --> 26:05.066
But Josh has his whole life

26:05.091 --> 26:07.391
to live as far from his
parents as he wants,

26:07.416 --> 26:09.483
if we treat his cancer.

26:13.052 --> 26:15.724
- Scissors to Dr. Bekker.
- Scissors.

26:15.758 --> 26:19.637
So, what's the story with you
and my friend with the flowers?

26:19.662 --> 26:22.200
I'm definitely picking
up on some rancor.

26:22.225 --> 26:24.750
How do I put this? Uh...

26:25.234 --> 26:28.420
my father and I have always had an...

26:28.693 --> 26:30.989
- unhealthy competition.
- Competition?

26:31.014 --> 26:32.781
You're a cardiothoracic surgeon.

26:32.806 --> 26:34.700
What is there to compete over?

26:34.725 --> 26:37.160
Well... next time you two get together,

26:37.185 --> 26:39.059
you can ask him about it.

26:39.084 --> 26:40.724
Snip.

26:41.972 --> 26:44.854
Let's take him off pump. Paddles.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.440
And clear.

26:53.124 --> 26:55.018
No retrograde flow.

26:55.043 --> 26:57.330
Congratulations, we
have a working valve.

26:57.411 --> 26:58.944
I'm gonna go let my patient know

26:58.969 --> 27:00.969
that he's about to get a new heart.

27:03.864 --> 27:06.098
Okay, I'll let her know.

27:08.330 --> 27:09.586
- Sharon?
- Yeah?

27:09.611 --> 27:11.077
That was Peter Kalmick.

27:11.276 --> 27:12.743
Apparently the board

27:12.768 --> 27:14.334
is refusing to let us go on bypass.

27:14.359 --> 27:16.392
They're overriding my decision?

27:16.481 --> 27:18.181
They didn't find sufficient reason

27:18.206 --> 27:19.627
to take such drastic action.

27:19.652 --> 27:21.797
There were enough opioids
on that man's coat

27:21.822 --> 27:24.268
- to drop a herd of elephants.
- Yep.

27:24.434 --> 27:26.343
You keep us on bypass.

27:26.375 --> 27:29.042
I'll deal with the board. I got you.

27:30.393 --> 27:32.426
Mr. and Mrs. Logan?

27:33.667 --> 27:36.401
I'm Dr. Choi. I've been
taking care of Josh.

27:36.426 --> 27:38.221
Thank you so much for contacting us.

27:38.246 --> 27:39.955
Of course. Please.

27:39.980 --> 27:42.649
Uh, he's run away before,
but he'd always come back,

27:42.674 --> 27:44.088
and then this time...

27:44.113 --> 27:45.618
We contacted the police.

27:45.643 --> 27:47.518
We tried every way we could to find him.

27:47.543 --> 27:49.572
I do have to warn you,

27:49.762 --> 27:52.296
calling you was my idea, not his,

27:52.321 --> 27:54.118
but he's very ill and he needs help,

27:54.143 --> 27:56.444
so please, no matter how this goes,

27:56.469 --> 27:59.033
try to understand and be patient.

27:59.058 --> 28:00.628
Of course.

28:00.653 --> 28:02.932
He's right over here.

28:07.157 --> 28:08.771
April...

28:08.796 --> 28:11.129
my patient in Two didn't go
for anymore tests, did he?

28:13.761 --> 28:15.653
Doesn't look like it.

28:16.081 --> 28:18.369
I'm sorry. Just give me a minute.

28:22.955 --> 28:25.079
Leah, did you see my patient?

28:25.104 --> 28:26.735
16-year-old boy, tall, brown hair?

28:26.760 --> 28:27.917
Yeah, I think so.

28:27.942 --> 28:30.760
Left with a young woman
about 20 minutes ago.

28:38.603 --> 28:41.271
Now, this shows distribution
of aggregate hospital costs

28:41.296 --> 28:43.889
and stays by payer for
our last fiscal year.

28:43.914 --> 28:45.421
Excuse me...

28:45.884 --> 28:47.914
I'm sorry to interrupt.

28:47.939 --> 28:49.484
Ms. Goodwin.

28:49.681 --> 28:52.913
As Executive Director of
Patient and Medical Services,

28:52.938 --> 28:55.461
the safety of our staff and patients

28:55.486 --> 28:57.653
is my responsibility.

28:57.839 --> 29:00.554
There are few substances

29:00.579 --> 29:04.593
more dangerous and
terrifying than fentanyl.

29:04.737 --> 29:06.741
Even a minute amount inhaled

29:06.766 --> 29:09.132
or absorbed through the skin

29:09.157 --> 29:11.576
can cause an overdose and even death,

29:11.601 --> 29:14.164
and while I understand going on bypass

29:14.189 --> 29:16.689
costs this hospital money,

29:16.714 --> 29:20.367
if just one person goes
into respiratory failure

29:20.392 --> 29:22.859
from coming in contact with this drug,

29:22.884 --> 29:24.515
I guarantee...

29:24.540 --> 29:27.541
that the damage to this
hospital's reputation

29:27.566 --> 29:29.977
will be far costlier.

29:30.138 --> 29:32.887
So, I'm sure you'll all agree

29:32.912 --> 29:35.639
that keeping us on bypass

29:35.664 --> 29:38.850
is medically and fiscally

29:38.875 --> 29:40.908
the best course of action.

29:40.933 --> 29:42.466
Well...

29:42.491 --> 29:44.291
since you put it like that...

29:44.316 --> 29:45.784
Thank you.

29:45.809 --> 29:47.319
I'll be in my office

29:47.344 --> 29:49.537
if anyone has anymore questions.

29:55.636 --> 29:57.006
Sharon...

29:58.468 --> 29:59.663
You shouldn't have done that.

29:59.688 --> 30:01.451
I don't see that I had a choice.

30:01.476 --> 30:03.663
Listen, I'm up here with them, okay?

30:03.688 --> 30:05.225
I hear which way the wind is blowing,

30:05.249 --> 30:06.582
and lately, the board feels

30:06.607 --> 30:08.123
that you are not making decisions

30:08.148 --> 30:10.326
that are aligned with this
hospital's interests.

30:10.351 --> 30:12.051
Well, I'm sorry, Peter,

30:12.076 --> 30:15.350
but I thought this
hospital's foremost interest

30:15.375 --> 30:17.232
was in treatment of patients.

30:17.257 --> 30:19.464
You're not hearing me,
and you keep taking

30:19.489 --> 30:22.279
an adversarial position
vis-à-vis the board

30:22.304 --> 30:24.114
and they will fire you.

30:34.217 --> 30:37.086
Hey, Dad.

30:37.111 --> 30:38.962
Sarah...

30:39.335 --> 30:41.342
So nice of you to come.

30:41.367 --> 30:44.401
I just wanted to, um,
see how you're doing.

30:44.426 --> 30:46.136
Did you?

30:46.575 --> 30:49.412
- No ulterior motive?
- What?

30:49.591 --> 30:52.740
Sure you didn't come here to
make yourself feel better

30:52.765 --> 30:55.270
by doing the right thing?

30:55.588 --> 30:57.826
That this visit isn't all about you?

30:57.851 --> 30:58.967
Dad, n...

30:58.992 --> 31:01.300
Maybe I'm not the only one

31:01.325 --> 31:03.325
with personality disorder.

31:03.350 --> 31:05.286
Are you serious?

31:05.311 --> 31:08.645
Oh, don't be so sensitive.

31:08.670 --> 31:10.337
Come now.

31:10.629 --> 31:12.498
Let's see what I can do

31:12.523 --> 31:14.722
to leave you with a good memory.

31:14.747 --> 31:16.225
Kay, this was clearly a mistake.

31:16.250 --> 31:19.006
Should we sit and reminisce?

31:19.031 --> 31:21.750
Perhaps order some hot cocoa?

31:21.775 --> 31:23.225
Goodbye, Dad.

31:23.250 --> 31:24.717
No, stay.

31:24.742 --> 31:26.210
Let's focus...

31:26.235 --> 31:28.388
on getting you some closure.

31:32.730 --> 31:34.607
I found your dad a heart.

31:37.214 --> 31:38.747
Thank you.

31:38.772 --> 31:41.732
We're gonna take him to
do the transplant now.

31:53.122 --> 31:56.123
- Dr. Choi?
- Please wait here a second.

31:58.538 --> 31:59.756
What do you think you're doing?

31:59.781 --> 32:01.420
He wanted to come back to Athena,

32:01.445 --> 32:03.256
- so I called us an Uber.
- Emma, I get it.

32:03.281 --> 32:05.296
He needs his dog, and I don't
wanna take that for him,

32:05.321 --> 32:06.803
but right now, he needs
our help even more.

32:06.828 --> 32:09.100
- This isn't a game.
- Like I don't know that?

32:09.125 --> 32:11.558
But you don't understand him. I do.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.557
I've been there.

32:13.733 --> 32:16.018
What do you mean? You've been homeless?

32:16.474 --> 32:18.228
Yeah.

32:18.517 --> 32:19.990
But that's not important.

32:20.015 --> 32:21.904
What matters is that this dog

32:21.929 --> 32:24.830
is the only thing in the
world Josh can relate to.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.355
I think he needs her so much

32:26.380 --> 32:28.217
that if he had to go on without her,

32:28.242 --> 32:30.491
he'd rather die.

32:31.121 --> 32:32.826
All right.

32:33.693 --> 32:36.594
Tell Josh to pack his clothes,
and we'll take the dog with us.

32:43.881 --> 32:45.857
H... help! Somebody!

32:45.882 --> 32:47.848
Uh, wh... wh... what's going on?

32:47.873 --> 32:49.510
Wh... what's happening?

32:52.437 --> 32:54.437
His lungs are full of fluid.
He must've been coming to

32:54.463 --> 32:56.431
and inhaled against his glottis.

32:56.456 --> 32:58.394
Sats down to 83.

32:59.153 --> 33:00.562
He lost his IV.

33:01.074 --> 33:02.640
Uh, do something! Save him!

33:02.665 --> 33:05.111
Just so you understand,
with the lack of oxygen,

33:05.136 --> 33:06.869
there's no guarantee that he won't have

33:06.894 --> 33:08.697
new physical or neurological deficits.

33:08.722 --> 33:10.321
Just save him, please.

33:10.346 --> 33:11.837
Do you understand what Dr.
Sexton is saying?

33:11.862 --> 33:14.156
He's my father. Please,
don't let him die.

33:14.181 --> 33:16.868
Okay, give 20 of Lasix, 20
of etomidate, 50 of sux.

33:16.893 --> 33:19.400
Open an intubation kit and
a central line kit, now.

33:19.425 --> 33:20.868
- Can you intubate?
- Yeah.

33:23.416 --> 33:24.673
Sats at 65.

33:26.776 --> 33:28.751
He's in PEA. Bag him.

33:28.776 --> 33:31.266
Give me a milligram of epinephrine.
I'll start CPR.

33:35.026 --> 33:37.048
Epinephrine's in.

33:37.073 --> 33:39.079
He's still in PEA. Another milligram.

33:42.563 --> 33:45.555
- Second milligram in.
- Come on, Dad.

33:45.580 --> 33:47.399
Still in PEA. Another milligram.

33:49.712 --> 33:51.462
Third milligram's in.

33:56.918 --> 34:00.053
What? No. No, no, no, no.

34:00.078 --> 34:01.696
I'm sorry.

34:01.721 --> 34:03.420
Daddy!

34:05.237 --> 34:07.337
Time of death, 17:13.

34:14.806 --> 34:16.947
I'm sorry.

34:32.514 --> 34:34.679
His abdomen's more distended,

34:34.705 --> 34:36.485
and his pain is getting worse.

34:36.510 --> 34:38.949
Like I was saying, we need
to take him up to surgery.

34:38.974 --> 34:40.748
Dale, maybe we should let them.

34:40.773 --> 34:42.540
Are you sure that that's necessary?

34:42.565 --> 34:44.251
Did you even talk to Dr. Kravitz?

34:44.275 --> 34:47.507
He says that general anesthesia
will exacerbate Kevin's PANDAS.

34:47.533 --> 34:48.650
You're not hearing me.

34:48.675 --> 34:50.797
At the moment, that is
not our biggest concern.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.954
- But Dr. Kravitz says...
- Forget about Dr. Kravitz.

34:52.978 --> 34:55.135
Kevin doesn't have PANDAS.

34:56.139 --> 34:58.138
His tics are from me.

34:59.252 --> 35:01.308
What are you talking about?

35:01.589 --> 35:03.423
He has OCD.

35:03.721 --> 35:06.271
It's not from step; it's genetic.

35:06.913 --> 35:09.775
He inherited it from me.

35:10.384 --> 35:12.717
It's a far more likely explanation.

35:12.742 --> 35:15.376
So the antibiotics, the... all of it...

35:15.401 --> 35:17.079
He never needed them.

35:17.104 --> 35:18.670
It's... it's my fault.

35:18.695 --> 35:20.410
All my fault.

35:21.295 --> 35:24.040
Why didn't you tell me you had OCD?

35:24.065 --> 35:26.365
I thought if you knew
something was wrong with me,

35:26.390 --> 35:28.210
you wouldn't love me.

35:32.699 --> 35:34.800
Do the surgery.

35:34.825 --> 35:37.594
Dale, wait...

35:38.035 --> 35:40.063
We'll get Kevin ready to go upstairs.

35:57.704 --> 36:01.006
His temperature is 99.6.

36:01.313 --> 36:03.549
It could signal the onset of infection,

36:03.574 --> 36:05.374
which would be a contraindication

36:05.399 --> 36:06.694
for performing the transplant.

36:06.719 --> 36:09.292
He won't get the heart?

36:09.317 --> 36:11.294
No, I'm sorry.

36:19.007 --> 36:20.940
He always runs warm.

36:22.455 --> 36:24.766
- What?
- My dad, um...

36:24.791 --> 36:27.091
his temperature always runs high.

36:27.116 --> 36:28.147
It's normal for him,

36:28.172 --> 36:30.381
which would mean that
this isn't an infection.

36:30.406 --> 36:32.273
You're sure? Because if that's the case,

36:32.298 --> 36:34.748
then he could still get the heart.

36:35.065 --> 36:37.866
Yes, I'm sure he's fine.

36:37.891 --> 36:40.162
Let's get Dr. Haywood up to the O.R.

36:40.187 --> 36:42.254
Yes, sir.

36:59.258 --> 37:00.824
All right.

37:01.445 --> 37:03.597
Ejection fraction looks good.

37:03.622 --> 37:05.850
Normal rate and rhythm.

37:06.780 --> 37:08.213
I think we did it.

37:08.238 --> 37:10.722
- Well done, Dr. Rhodes.
- You as well.

37:10.747 --> 37:12.480
Dr. Mehta, will you please close?

37:12.505 --> 37:14.230
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

37:20.584 --> 37:23.503
I must admit, despite
your overall surliness,

37:23.528 --> 37:25.218
your determination today

37:25.243 --> 37:28.199
in the face of great odds was admirable.

37:28.550 --> 37:30.116
I will take that as a compliment.

37:30.141 --> 37:31.833
You should.

37:33.056 --> 37:35.127
I'm gonna go take my flowers home.

37:35.824 --> 37:37.323
Ava...

37:39.916 --> 37:42.871
It's not that it's my
dad you're dating...

37:49.085 --> 37:51.855
I wish that you weren't
dating anybody at all.

37:54.348 --> 37:57.441
As long as we're making confessions,

37:57.976 --> 38:01.261
I was never dating your father.

38:02.242 --> 38:04.550
But you didn't mind me thinking so.

38:04.575 --> 38:06.617
No, I didn't mind.

38:14.244 --> 38:16.503
Oh, Josh.

38:16.886 --> 38:19.152
- Hello, Josh.
- Hi.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.866
Uh, Dr. Choi told us
about what's going on,

38:22.891 --> 38:25.428
and we're gonna get through
this, honey, together.

38:26.394 --> 38:28.460
I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble.

38:28.485 --> 38:30.517
We're just glad to see you again,

38:30.542 --> 38:32.519
and that you're safe.

38:36.183 --> 38:39.329
Josh will need to stay
here for about two weeks,

38:39.514 --> 38:42.157
but after that, he's agreed
to go home with you,

38:42.182 --> 38:44.462
if you let him bring his dog.

38:44.487 --> 38:46.782
- Of course.
- Anything.

38:46.807 --> 38:49.975
- What's its name?
- Athena.

38:50.369 --> 38:52.770
Well, we'll take care of Athena.

38:55.651 --> 38:57.340
Please follow me.

38:59.049 --> 39:02.118
Uh, we'll get Athena
after we settle Josh in.

39:02.143 --> 39:03.595
Of course.

39:11.690 --> 39:14.774
He's never really gonna be
able to love them back, is he?

39:14.927 --> 39:16.774
By our definition?

39:17.057 --> 39:18.657
Unlikely.

39:20.421 --> 39:23.360
I don't know who to feel more sorry for,

39:23.385 --> 39:25.642
the parents or him.

39:34.283 --> 39:36.166
Thanks.

39:36.533 --> 39:38.066
Really?

39:38.091 --> 39:39.724
For what?

39:39.749 --> 39:41.448
You did good today.

39:45.287 --> 39:47.021
Maybe we could use you around here.

39:49.934 --> 39:52.201
Athena...

40:04.088 --> 40:06.589
It'd be so hard to do that all alone.

40:12.223 --> 40:13.828
What?

40:13.853 --> 40:15.753
It's just...

40:15.778 --> 40:18.110
I know when mom and dad get old,

40:18.344 --> 40:20.543
at least we'll face it together.

40:29.364 --> 40:32.432
Kevin's fever is coming down,
and his numbers all look great.

40:32.473 --> 40:34.940
- I think he's gonna be okay.
- Thank you, Dr. Manning.

40:47.976 --> 40:49.993
At least they can start getting Kevin

40:50.027 --> 40:51.459
- the help he needs.
- Yeah.

40:51.484 --> 40:52.868
Hey, Will...

40:54.902 --> 40:56.621
I'm not perfect.

40:56.977 --> 41:00.376
I have got a million
fears and insecurities

41:00.401 --> 41:03.086
about being a doctor, a mother,

41:03.426 --> 41:04.592
everything.

41:06.155 --> 41:07.855
It's exhausting.

41:09.925 --> 41:12.804
But yes, sometimes, I...

41:13.766 --> 41:15.974
push it too far.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.976
It's okay.

41:18.176 --> 41:19.894
I understand.

41:19.922 --> 41:21.896
Good.

41:22.884 --> 41:25.233
It still doesn't mean you get
a pass for the other night.

41:34.696 --> 41:36.662
Looks like he's gonna live.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.979
Yeah.

41:42.726 --> 41:44.241
Now what?
