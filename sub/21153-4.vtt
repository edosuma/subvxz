WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:04.305
JAMIE: Ten years ago,
the animal population mutated,

00:04.338 --> 00:06.340
endangering human
life on the planet.

00:06.374 --> 00:07.241
(animals roaring)

00:07.275 --> 00:08.652
Our team managed to
cure the animals,

00:08.676 --> 00:11.579
but at a terrible cost.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.282
In an attempt to return
the planet to the animals,

00:14.315 --> 00:15.592
a secretive group
called The Shepherds

00:15.616 --> 00:18.452
released a gas that
sterilized all of humanity.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.656
And then, lab-made creatures...
Called hybrids...

00:22.690 --> 00:24.058
Devastated the West Coast.

00:24.092 --> 00:26.694
So a massive barrier
was constructed

00:26.727 --> 00:29.430
to protect the rest
of North America...

00:29.463 --> 00:30.740
(roaring) but new breeds
have started to appear,

00:30.764 --> 00:32.266
(squawking)

00:32.299 --> 00:34.235
so we reassembled our team.

00:34.268 --> 00:37.071
We battle on many fronts,

00:37.105 --> 00:39.173
searching for a
cure to sterility

00:39.207 --> 00:40.174
while racing to stop the hybrids

00:40.208 --> 00:41.709
and a brutal terrorist

00:41.742 --> 00:43.444
with a plan to end
the human race.

00:43.477 --> 00:47.848
The fight for mankind's
survival has just begun.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.083
(snarling)

00:49.717 --> 00:50.818
Previously on Zoo...

00:50.851 --> 00:53.687
NEWSWOMAN: Authorities are
searching for this woman,

00:53.721 --> 00:55.389
Abigail Westbrook.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.391
Who also happens
to be my sister.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.727
LEANNE: I can get Isaac back.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.529
Let's talk about
Clementine Lewis.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.164
Please, God, please.

01:03.197 --> 01:06.100
(heartbeat pounding)

01:06.134 --> 01:07.611
LOGAN: I tracked the
hybrid's flight path.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.470
JACKSON: Flew to Mexico?

01:09.503 --> 01:10.371
There, stop.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.640
That's Abigail.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.218
Two new species pop up
in the span of 48 hours?

01:14.242 --> 01:17.245
And Abigail is at
the center of it.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.314
JACKSON: Mitch?

01:20.348 --> 01:22.216
Jackson. You're alive?

01:22.250 --> 01:24.452
Well, this is more
than a little weird.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.120
And that thing just
started moving.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.489
JACKSON: We got to
get out of here!

01:28.522 --> 01:29.523
(screeching)

01:35.829 --> 01:38.532
(hybrids screeching)

01:41.269 --> 01:42.603
(whirring rapidly)

01:44.772 --> 01:46.612
MITCH: This must be what's
drawing the hybrids.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.409
(zaps) Ah.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.878
I'm just gonna assume
there's no "off" switch.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.882
That can't be good.

01:54.915 --> 01:58.719
Is anyone else freaked out by
the fact that they're flying?

01:58.752 --> 02:00.588
That's not all they do.
How about let's go?

02:02.456 --> 02:03.891
Come on!

02:03.924 --> 02:04.934
(hybrids roaring, screeching)

02:04.958 --> 02:06.227
Oh!

02:06.260 --> 02:08.895
Whoa!

02:08.929 --> 02:10.698
Chopper out back.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.803
Let's go! Let's go!

02:15.836 --> 02:18.172
Let's go!

02:18.206 --> 02:19.273
Come on!

02:23.944 --> 02:25.879
Whoa, whoa!

02:25.913 --> 02:27.481
Come on, let's go!

02:29.217 --> 02:31.352
MITCH: So, what brings you
boys south of the border?

02:31.385 --> 02:32.786
We're tracking a woman

02:32.820 --> 02:35.256
who bombed my refugee
camp in Portland.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.358
But more importantly,
where the hell you been?

02:37.391 --> 02:39.427
Hibernated in a healing tank.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.694
Rescued by a fake daughter.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.263
Shot real daughter.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.932
Found an evil Shepherd
device inside my skull.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.834
Brain surgery with
a farm animal.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.469
Freaky new memories
brought me here.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.837
Really? That's it?

02:49.870 --> 02:51.672
And for us, that's a Tuesday.

02:51.705 --> 02:52.706
(hybrid crashing)

02:56.844 --> 02:58.479
(squawking)

03:05.653 --> 03:08.689
Oh. Sarge is not gonna be happy.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.758
Plan B. Let's get to the truck.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.933
(hybrids screeching)

03:23.337 --> 03:25.606
(hybrids crashing)

03:36.284 --> 03:38.819
Leaving so soon, brother?

03:38.852 --> 03:40.654
Gonna miss the big show.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.304
That doesn't sound right.

03:58.306 --> 03:59.340
That's not good.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.775
Home sweet plane.

04:04.978 --> 04:05.913
She's gonna need some

04:05.946 --> 04:07.981
serious TLC if she's
gonna be road worthy

04:08.015 --> 04:09.817
any time soon.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.985
Looks like we
snagged a passenger.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.922
Okay, we're wheels up in five.

04:14.955 --> 04:15.999
JACKSON: I guess you can shove

04:16.023 --> 04:17.690
a cockpit into a tablet

04:17.725 --> 04:19.827
when you've made a fortune
off of people's pain.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.060
Look, I know

04:21.094 --> 04:22.396
it's cool to hate me right now,

04:22.430 --> 04:23.664
but I really am sorry.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.699
Just save it.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.044
Right now we need to figure out
what those hybrids are doing.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.370
(explosion)

04:29.403 --> 04:32.406
MITCH: That might be our answer.

04:32.440 --> 04:36.444
Uh, you might want to
speed up that takeoff time.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.551
♪

04:56.630 --> 04:59.400
Order up.
Eggs benny, extra runny.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.638
You heard what Leanne said.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.039
Clem is a thief.

05:06.073 --> 05:09.543
I know this is hard...

05:12.713 --> 05:16.684
but if turning her over to
Reiden gets us Isaac back,

05:16.717 --> 05:18.919
that's a deal we should
be willing to take.

05:18.952 --> 05:22.423
We only know what
Leanne told us.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.958
Why believe a woman
who stole our son?

05:27.728 --> 05:30.398
You can't be serious about this.

05:32.566 --> 05:35.369
Abe, we are talking
about Mitch's daughter.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.037
How could we ever do that?

05:39.773 --> 05:42.610
You can't just sit
there and say nothing.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.778
Not now.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.616
You guys know what you want?

05:48.649 --> 05:50.117
Or do you need a
little more time?

05:59.827 --> 06:01.795
JACKSON: Which insane
thing should we start with?

06:01.829 --> 06:05.866
The, uh, new hybrid species
or exploding volcanoes?

06:05.899 --> 06:08.636
Do we know that the new hybrids
caused the volcano to explode?

06:08.669 --> 06:09.837
MITCH: I seem to remember

06:09.870 --> 06:12.139
a sloth that could make
earthquakes happen.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.841
That ringing a
bell with anybody?

06:13.874 --> 06:17.545
So, uh,
this is who we are looking for.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.613
Her name is Abigail Westbrook

06:19.647 --> 06:21.615
and so far,
tracking her down has been, uh...

06:21.649 --> 06:23.016
I recognize her.
She's a Shepherd.

06:25.653 --> 06:28.656
All right. Now...
(clears throat)

06:28.689 --> 06:31.725
she used this disc to operate
the device back in the cabin.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.994
Yeah, whatever that device was,

06:34.027 --> 06:37.765
it was attracting the hybrids
to its location like a, uh...

06:39.767 --> 06:40.734
like a...

06:40.768 --> 06:41.902
Beacon.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.136
Yeah, that.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.805
Yeah, so more than one disc

06:44.838 --> 06:46.039
means more than one beacon.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.008
The more beacons
that she activates,

06:48.041 --> 06:49.677
the more the
hybrids will spread.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.545
But no one's ever
seen a flying hybrid.

06:51.579 --> 06:52.689
Where are they spreading from?

06:52.713 --> 06:54.448
(sighs) MITCH: I have a feeling

06:54.482 --> 06:56.025
that the answer to that
question is gonna be real weird.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.685
JACKSON: So...

06:57.718 --> 06:59.820
this is the previous
hybrid population density

06:59.853 --> 07:01.789
on the West Coast.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.991
Here's what happened after
she activated that beacon.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.627
Fortunately,
inside the hybrid zone.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.104
Abe said that these things
can reproduce asexually

07:08.128 --> 07:09.930
from a single drop of blood,

07:09.963 --> 07:13.000
which means exponential growth
once they get to a new area.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.536
Now that we have flying hybrids,

07:15.569 --> 07:17.638
this is what would happen
if she got a beacon

07:17.671 --> 07:18.906
east of the barrier.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.808
(computer trilling rapidly)

07:24.812 --> 07:27.781
And this is what it would
look like if she got a beacon

07:27.815 --> 07:29.683
all the way to Europe.

07:29.717 --> 07:32.553
So, how long till Hybri-geddon?

07:32.586 --> 07:35.188
(sighs) Based on
these calculations...

07:41.595 --> 07:43.931
90 days.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.766
(computer trilling rapidly)

07:49.202 --> 07:52.840
Here with Leanne Ducovny,
the Reiden CEO responsible

07:52.873 --> 07:55.108
for the controversial abductions

07:55.142 --> 07:57.811
of thousands of children
from their homes.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.013
Since then,
you've had protestors

08:00.047 --> 08:01.882
outside your office every day

08:01.915 --> 08:05.185
and mounting pressure
to allow the government

08:05.218 --> 08:07.187
access to your facilities.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.289
These are people's children.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.192
Don't you think some
transparency could help?

08:12.225 --> 08:13.727
Let me stop you right there.

08:13.761 --> 08:16.129
First of all,
"the youth rejuvenation program"

08:16.163 --> 08:19.567
isn't a punishment;
it's a promise.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.869
It's a promise to
solve sterility.

08:21.902 --> 08:25.773
So, you see yourself as
the savior of mankind?

08:25.806 --> 08:26.707
(video rewinds)

08:26.740 --> 08:27.875
savior of mankind.

08:27.908 --> 08:28.876
(video rewinds)

08:28.909 --> 08:30.878
savior of mankind.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.986
So, been dying to ask you
guys, how was my funeral?

08:39.019 --> 08:40.888
Very tasteful.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.323
What song did you guys pick?

08:43.356 --> 08:44.958
"Wind Beneath My Wings"?

08:46.627 --> 08:48.862
"Who Let the Dogs Out."

08:50.297 --> 08:52.257
Yeah, that was the last
time we were all together.

08:53.734 --> 08:57.104
After you were gone,
things just, um...

08:57.137 --> 08:58.639
weren't the same.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.741
MITCH: So...

09:00.774 --> 09:03.644
you decided to move to the
middle of hybrid country?

09:07.014 --> 09:08.749
Well, a couple years later,

09:08.782 --> 09:11.051
a regular life just wasn't
really an option for me, so...

09:11.084 --> 09:12.820
MITCH: Well, that can happen

09:12.853 --> 09:15.923
if you're the son of the guy
who created worldwide sterility.

09:15.956 --> 09:20.260
Yeah, circumstances were, um...

09:20.293 --> 09:23.230
I... had to get away.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.098
Plus,
people out there need help.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.876
You know? Someone's got to
clean up that Shepherd mess.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.368
May as well be me.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.913
Well, at least now
you won't have to play

09:29.937 --> 09:33.040
bumbling-but-effective
hero on your own.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.043
"Who Let the Dogs
Out," that's very good.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.911
Wait, Jackson.

09:37.945 --> 09:41.248
Please, I... I'm so sorry.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.382
So am I.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.184
Can I explain?
We have to figure out

09:44.217 --> 09:45.361
what's going on
with the new hybrids

09:45.385 --> 09:46.620
and we have to find Abigail.

09:58.231 --> 10:02.936
MITCH: How the hell did these
things cause a volcano to erupt?

10:02.970 --> 10:05.405
Biology of this hybrid is nuts.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.207
Look at the size
of that ear canal.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.744
It's incredibly
similar to Marsupialia

10:10.778 --> 10:12.946
that use echolocation.

10:12.980 --> 10:18.118
Abe was onto something with
that unique hybrid frequency.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.321
They're using it to communicate.

10:21.354 --> 10:24.758
So... if we can reverse
engineer the frequency,

10:24.792 --> 10:26.269
maybe we can find
one of those beacons,

10:26.293 --> 10:27.995
track down Abigail, right?

10:28.028 --> 10:30.798
Stop Abigail,
we stop the hybrid spread.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.300
That thing is really cool.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.837
Um... Abe is a sex doctor?

10:36.870 --> 10:40.273
Which is gross enough,
but why-why is he studying hybrids?

10:40.307 --> 10:43.143
He's not a sex doctor; he's a
reproductive endocrinologist.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.445
He thinks that
hybrids are the key

10:45.478 --> 10:48.882
to solving the
world's sterility.

10:48.916 --> 10:52.019
Yeah, there's a lot going on.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.821
And seeing as I've had to learn

10:53.854 --> 10:55.198
the biology of an
entirely new species

10:55.222 --> 10:56.824
on the fly...

10:58.058 --> 10:59.426
my obvious time away

10:59.459 --> 11:01.795
from current technology...
Oh, and the fact

11:01.829 --> 11:03.931
that Abigail could
strike at any moment,

11:03.964 --> 11:05.866
I feel like it might be
a good time to bring...

11:05.899 --> 11:08.011
That's a lot of words to say
that you need Abe's help.

11:08.035 --> 11:11.438
(quietly): I'm gonna need
a little grace period.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.741
I'm post-tank Mitch.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.876
Let's go to Michigan,

11:15.909 --> 11:17.911
find a sex doctor.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.354
(sirens wailing,
people shouting)

11:27.387 --> 11:30.023
CAL: It's anarchy
outside, Leanne.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.059
These protesters,
they want their kids back.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.361
And if it means burning
down an entire city block,

11:34.394 --> 11:35.763
they'll do it.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.230
Wake up, Cal.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.199
Flying hybrids are a reality,

11:39.232 --> 11:42.269
and sterility isn't
magically going away.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.271
With these twin
threats, human beings

11:44.304 --> 11:46.473
could be an endangered
species in ten years.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.008
You want to save mankind,

11:48.041 --> 11:49.777
you have to make
tough decisions.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.112
We need to earn the
trust of the public.

11:52.145 --> 11:55.015
The board and I are unanimous.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.450
You will allow a full
and complete inspection

11:57.484 --> 11:59.152
by government officials.

11:59.186 --> 12:02.155
There are dangers here
that you don't understand.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.024
I don't care, Leanne!

12:04.057 --> 12:05.993
You make this work.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.828
And if you can't,

12:07.861 --> 12:09.196
we'll find someone who can.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.001
(door opens, closes)

12:16.103 --> 12:18.238
Should I set up the
inspection appointments?

12:18.271 --> 12:20.207
Yes.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.875
And double security outside.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.177
Revoke all non-essential
keycards.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.046
Okay.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.190
JACKSON: Hey guys,
we're touching down in Michigan

12:27.214 --> 12:28.882
in ten.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.221
A little bit stressed?

12:34.254 --> 12:37.524
Yeah, not all family
reunions are pleasant.

12:37.557 --> 12:41.228
Are you talking about what
happened with Jackson earlier?

12:41.261 --> 12:42.796
What was that all about?

12:42.830 --> 12:44.031
It's a long story.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.065
Try me.

12:47.835 --> 12:50.871
Okay. Five years ago,
Jackson went into hiding.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.405
That's not that big.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.407
Well, he didn't go
because he wanted to.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.110
When my book was published,

12:57.144 --> 12:59.947
I gave everyone pseudonyms
to protect them.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.915
And it worked for
everyone but Jackson.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.351
Didn't matter that my
book said he was innocent,

13:04.384 --> 13:06.153
he's the son of Robert Oz.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.022
And the Shepherd
hunters wanted blood.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.091
Okay.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.093
So that is sort of big.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.330
But wait, don't you work
for the Shepherd hunters?

13:19.032 --> 13:22.302
I work with them,
when it serves me.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.037
(phone chimes)

13:30.911 --> 13:32.191
CLEMENTINE:
Everything all right?

13:33.346 --> 13:35.983
Yes, everything's fine.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.550
(turbine whirring)

13:37.584 --> 13:40.087
(tires screech)

13:42.089 --> 13:45.325
What do we tell them when
they start asking about Isaac?

13:45.358 --> 13:47.060
If Mitch were to find
out about Clem...

13:47.094 --> 13:49.196
Just let me do the talking.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.201
Dariela!

13:54.234 --> 13:55.936
Jackson. Abe.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.170
Ha, ha, rafiki.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.538
(laughs)

13:58.571 --> 14:00.373
(dog barking)

14:00.407 --> 14:02.209
Who's this?

14:02.242 --> 14:04.244
Pizza.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.646
My friend.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.248
It's been so long.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.952
(Abraham laughs) Yeah.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.453
Oh... (Jackson laughs)

14:13.486 --> 14:15.989
(sighs)

14:16.023 --> 14:18.058
How is Isaac?

14:18.091 --> 14:20.928
That hybrid sample that you
needed, Abe,

14:20.961 --> 14:22.471
I wasn't able to track
another one down.

14:22.495 --> 14:25.465
It's okay. And the Isaac
situation is being handled.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.136
Abe, if Isaac needs any help,

14:29.169 --> 14:31.871
you know that we will
do whatever it takes.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.175
It's complicated.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.610
I'll fill you in
later, I promise.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.612
Just stay with me on this one.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.050
I'll let you two catch up.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.084
Come on, Pizza.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.086
(Pizza barks)

14:46.119 --> 14:50.190
You being on this side of
the barrier is dangerous.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.159
Yeah, but I had to.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.361
Why would leave that
protection you had?

14:54.394 --> 14:56.629
You had a life there.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.999
You were seeing someone.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.969
Tessa, yes?

15:02.002 --> 15:05.038
Was, yes. Not anymore, I, uh...

15:05.072 --> 15:08.275
told her everything,
and her reaction was...

15:08.308 --> 15:11.111
less than desirable.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.279
I'm sorry, rafiki.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.981
Hey, it's okay.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.083
I had to rip the Band-Aid
off at some point.

15:16.116 --> 15:19.119
Couldn't fight this war from
the hybrid zone forever.

15:20.653 --> 15:24.091
Now come on,
let's get the band back together, huh?

15:24.124 --> 15:26.359
(laughs)

15:26.393 --> 15:28.261
Ah...

15:32.265 --> 15:34.301
There he is.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.138
Our very own Mr. Spock.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.249
Like in part two when he
dies, and then part three...

15:40.273 --> 15:41.708
Yeah, I-I get the reference.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.176
(chuckles) You know,
when I found out

15:43.210 --> 15:44.320
that you let Max raise my kid,

15:44.344 --> 15:45.979
I almost went back
into the grave...

15:46.013 --> 15:47.314
(laughs, stammers)

15:47.347 --> 15:50.317
I can't... (laughs)

15:50.350 --> 15:53.020
Even a pack of wild razorbacks
couldn't keep you down.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.322
What did you do,
fight them off with your bare hands?

15:55.355 --> 15:57.324
No, but I like that
version better.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.194
Dr. Kenyatta.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.265
Detective.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.334
Dariela.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.369
JAMIE: Hi, guys.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.240
It's great to see you.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.075
Jamie.

16:17.777 --> 16:21.281
I-I'm sorry I kind of ditched
you guys the other day.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.116
ABRAHAM: Ditched?

16:23.150 --> 16:25.218
That would be one
way of putting it.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.519
I couldn't risk your lives.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.388
You have a son.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.390
I saw the news about
Reiden taking the kids.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.125
Is Isaac...?

16:32.159 --> 16:34.294
He's safe.
He's with his Aunt Isabel

16:34.327 --> 16:35.728
in the Upper Peninsula.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.401
Great.

16:47.740 --> 16:51.244
Hey, can you toss me
that 'lectro wrench?

16:51.278 --> 16:53.213
Didn't realize you
were into cars.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.315
Guilty as charged.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.117
Total gearhead.

16:57.150 --> 17:00.320
Angry, sad, lonely.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.465
Whatever I was feeling growing
up, cars were always there.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.156
(tool whirring) Always the same.

17:04.191 --> 17:08.228
I guess, I guess they helped
me make sense of things.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.762
And given the current
state of the world,

17:10.797 --> 17:13.366
I could use a little
bit of that right now.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.135
Couldn't we all?

17:15.167 --> 17:17.304
Socket driver?

17:17.337 --> 17:20.073
This one? Yeah.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.375
Thanks.

17:22.409 --> 17:25.444
So what's it like being
back with your dead dad?

17:25.478 --> 17:28.315
(tool whirs) Weird.

17:28.348 --> 17:31.351
What's it like being one of
the last mothers on Earth?

17:31.384 --> 17:32.352
(exhales)

17:32.385 --> 17:35.355
Weird.

17:35.388 --> 17:39.526
It's been a tough couple years
since we all saw each other.

17:39.559 --> 17:43.263
I know you haven't had an easy
go, either.

17:43.296 --> 17:47.400
That's true, but...
but everybody's different.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.678
You never know how you're gonna
react in a tough situation

17:49.702 --> 17:51.338
until you're in it, you know?

17:51.371 --> 17:54.441
(tool whirring)

17:54.474 --> 17:56.876
We all have our regrets.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.346
Done things we're not proud of.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.848
We all have our secrets.

18:01.881 --> 18:04.351
All my regrets are behind me.

18:04.384 --> 18:08.288
Well, sometimes our
regrets catch up to us.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.490
(tool whirring)

18:14.827 --> 18:17.630
ABRAHAM: Now, if I'm correct,

18:17.664 --> 18:20.433
this should feed the signal I
recorded from the hybrid egg

18:20.467 --> 18:21.834
through this subject's larynx

18:21.868 --> 18:25.605
synthesizing a sort
of outgoing call.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.440
And once it bounces back,

18:27.474 --> 18:28.641
we should, theoretically,

18:28.675 --> 18:31.444
get the location
of the next beacon.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.812
(computer beeping)

18:32.845 --> 18:36.349
It may take a while
to get an answer.

18:36.383 --> 18:40.453
This hybrid frequency is
like nothing I've ever seen.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.655
So we could be looking

18:42.689 --> 18:44.757
at a highly evolved
form of communication,

18:44.791 --> 18:46.793
similar to how octopuses

18:46.826 --> 18:49.796
use their changing colors
as mating signals, right?

18:49.829 --> 18:52.799
It's recently been proven
that their changes in color

18:52.832 --> 18:55.835
are actually a complex language.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.670
Great.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.506
Even better.

18:59.539 --> 19:02.542
But it could also be similar
to, uh,

19:02.575 --> 19:04.877
the groupthink of
honey bee colonies.

19:04.911 --> 19:07.480
The prevailing theory
now is that bees

19:07.514 --> 19:10.550
use myriad odors
as communication.

19:10.583 --> 19:15.255
Did the entire scientific world
just implode while I was gone?

19:15.288 --> 19:17.490
I mean, the big ones
are still around right?

19:17.524 --> 19:20.693
The second law of
thermodynamics?

19:20.727 --> 19:23.796
It's more like second guideline.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.466
Theory of relativity?

19:26.499 --> 19:28.701
It's still a theory.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.271
(laughs): Relatively.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.472
That was cute.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.573
What about gravity?

19:33.606 --> 19:35.775
Gravity still a thing?

19:35.808 --> 19:37.544
Define "thing."

19:37.577 --> 19:39.512
Shut up.
I'm going to get a drink.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.180
I know that's still a thing.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.322
NEW ANCHOR: In the face
of widespread outrage

19:49.356 --> 19:52.592
and protest,
Reiden CEO Leanne Ducovny

19:52.625 --> 19:54.894
had this to say in defense
of her company's abduction

19:54.927 --> 19:56.496
and internment of children.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.897
LEANNE: Mark my words.

19:57.930 --> 20:01.501
Humanity will flourish again.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.470
MITCH: Well, that's fun.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.374
This guy has
supracoracoideus muscles

20:07.407 --> 20:09.017
that look just like the
ones in hummingbirds.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.577
Well, that makes
sense, for flight.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.978
Yeah, but look.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.414
He's got an entirely extra set.

20:14.447 --> 20:17.784
Now, these things expand and
contract at super high speeds,

20:17.817 --> 20:19.962
but they're totally unnecessary
for the way this guy flies.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.530
Wait a minute,
you said these new hybrids

20:21.554 --> 20:23.390
were diving under the ground

20:23.423 --> 20:24.657
in Mexico, correct?

20:24.691 --> 20:26.759
Well, what if they
used these new muscles

20:26.793 --> 20:29.329
underground, en masse?

20:29.362 --> 20:32.665
If there were enough of
them, uh...

20:32.699 --> 20:35.835
compound vibrations
could potentially cause

20:35.868 --> 20:37.470
massive acoustic fluidization,

20:37.504 --> 20:39.005
which would trigger

20:39.038 --> 20:40.573
volcanic eruptions...

20:40.607 --> 20:43.042
Which did trigger a
volcanic eruption.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.478
And Abigail can
summon them at will.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.516
(alert beeping)

20:49.549 --> 20:52.652
We found a beacon.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.023
It's moving.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.658
She must be transporting it.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.693
JACKSON: Abigail's
heading to New York City.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.529
Okay. I'll alert the department,

21:02.562 --> 21:04.331
we'll get barricades set up

21:04.364 --> 21:05.965
in a ten-mile
radius around city.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.701
This barrier's been
protecting the East Coast.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.303
There are people this side of it

21:10.337 --> 21:12.472
who haven't even
seen a hybrid before.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.916
Yeah, well, if these things
fly over those barriers,

21:13.940 --> 21:15.508
they're gonna see a
whole lot of them.

21:15.542 --> 21:16.609
As they get eaten.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.911
If the hybrids
get into the city,

21:18.945 --> 21:21.548
the East Coast
could fall in days.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.583
We have to go there.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.403
Who's The Falcon?

21:45.405 --> 21:47.607
Yeah, listen,
I'm already aware of your whole,

21:47.640 --> 21:50.443
"he puts the lotion in the
basket" situation downstairs,

21:50.477 --> 21:54.347
so... it's a little late
to save your reputation.

21:54.381 --> 21:55.948
Okay.

21:55.982 --> 21:59.352
There are two Shepherds

21:59.386 --> 22:01.554
that I haven't been
able to track down.

22:01.588 --> 22:03.923
One is Mr. Duncan,
who is a ghost,

22:03.956 --> 22:06.659
and the other is The Falcon,

22:06.693 --> 22:09.996
who is apparently ascended to
the upper echelons of power.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.865
But, after all this time,

22:12.899 --> 22:14.634
The Falcon has
remained out of reach.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.103
Is that a Tom Collins?

22:18.738 --> 22:19.882
Since when is that your drink?

22:19.906 --> 22:22.709
Well, a few things have
changed in the last ten years.

22:22.742 --> 22:25.712
Yeah, I noticed.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.346
What happened to you?

22:29.916 --> 22:32.685
I guess I just always
thought that if...

22:32.719 --> 22:37.089
I could tell people the truth,
that things would change.

22:37.123 --> 22:40.960
But it didn't stop Reiden
from killing people,

22:40.993 --> 22:44.397
didn't stop the Shepherds.

22:44.431 --> 22:48.868
The same people that were in
power then are in power now.

22:48.901 --> 22:52.104
And I got really sick of
not seeing justice done.

22:52.138 --> 22:54.674
So,
I went out and did it myself.

22:57.944 --> 23:02.615
All right, I'm still adjusting
to the new super Jamie.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.517
I mean,
for you it's been ten years.

23:04.551 --> 23:08.154
For me, what?
We set some birds loose on a beach,

23:08.187 --> 23:11.023
I took a nap,
you cracked my skull open.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.493
How is that, by the way?

23:13.526 --> 23:16.663
To be honest, I don't know.

23:16.696 --> 23:21.568
But, um,
this quest thing that you're on,

23:21.601 --> 23:24.604
it just seems a
little dark for you.

23:24.637 --> 23:28.675
Well, I guess there...

23:28.708 --> 23:31.010
wasn't a whole lot
to look forward to.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.049
How about now?

23:41.120 --> 23:43.122
♪

23:50.697 --> 23:53.833
Earlier, what you said about
handing over Clem to Reiden,

23:53.866 --> 23:55.902
I know this is about Isaac,

23:55.935 --> 24:00.707
but now that we're all back
together, seeing her,

24:00.740 --> 24:02.742
we have to find another way.

24:02.775 --> 24:06.012
There may not be another way
and we're running out of time.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.680
We just need time to think.

24:07.714 --> 24:10.850
Not making a decision
is still a decision.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.686
If we let this deadline
pass, that choice is gone

24:13.720 --> 24:16.122
and we lose our only chance
of getting Isaac back.

24:16.155 --> 24:19.926
ABIGAIL: I don't
understand men like you.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.127
(distant siren wailing)

24:21.160 --> 24:23.730
World hangs over an abyss

24:23.763 --> 24:25.832
and yet you protect order.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.837
Imagine you find it honorable.

24:30.870 --> 24:33.740
Band playing on while
the Titanic sinks

24:33.773 --> 24:36.509
into the cold depths.

24:36.543 --> 24:40.680
But honor is a lie
you tell yourself.

24:40.713 --> 24:43.282
I think you're afraid.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.785
I think you enforce that order

24:45.818 --> 24:48.220
because you don't
know what else to do.

24:48.254 --> 24:51.791
Suppose it gave you purpose.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.761
Lucky for me...

24:54.794 --> 24:56.829
it also gave you this.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.640
Well, that was fun.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.242
Can we go do it in
the cockpit now?

25:10.276 --> 25:12.579
After I converted
the plane to tablet,

25:12.612 --> 25:16.883
I had the cockpit turned
into a breakfast nook.

25:16.916 --> 25:20.186
Can you say that again,
please, but just slower?

25:26.292 --> 25:28.728
Um, rain check.

25:28.761 --> 25:31.297
I got to go do something first.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.708
Jackson, look, we can't go on like this.
Just stop.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.610
I know I put a
target on your back

25:43.643 --> 25:44.844
for the last five years,

25:44.877 --> 25:46.746
and you're angry
and it's warranted.

25:46.779 --> 25:47.947
I can keep apologizing.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.783
This isn't about me, Jamie.

25:50.817 --> 25:55.287
Abe sacrificed everything for
me, to keep my safe.

25:55.321 --> 25:59.291
His marriage, his job, his son.

25:59.325 --> 26:02.795
And I will never be able
to repay him for that.

26:02.829 --> 26:05.064
So, I just hope that

26:05.097 --> 26:07.566
that best-seller
list was worth it.

26:10.036 --> 26:12.905
Come with me.
We need to take a little walk.

26:16.976 --> 26:18.978
(Jackson sighs)

26:21.047 --> 26:23.816
Okay, what are we doing?

26:30.256 --> 26:32.825
Mansdale? Oh, look.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.360
The coward son of Oz.

26:34.393 --> 26:36.796
Talk again and I
cut your eye out.

26:36.829 --> 26:38.865
This is what I've been
protecting you from.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.800
What are you talking about?

26:40.833 --> 26:42.234
Protecting me?

26:42.268 --> 26:44.871
Why do the Shepherd hunters
think you're in Asia?

26:44.904 --> 26:48.040
Who scrubbed your photo from
every server on the planet?

26:48.074 --> 26:50.309
The only thing keeping
you on this side of a cage

26:50.342 --> 26:51.944
or worse is me.

26:51.978 --> 26:54.914
That's very generous of you.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.415
Except you're the reason

26:56.448 --> 26:58.617
that they're chasing
me in the first place.

27:05.725 --> 27:07.960
You have a choice to make.

27:07.994 --> 27:11.063
If I am the grand villain of your
life, you can shoot me.

27:11.097 --> 27:14.901
Or you can shoot one of the
men who tried to end the world.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.003
Or...

27:17.036 --> 27:19.706
you can accept that
what's past is past

27:19.739 --> 27:23.075
and move on with whatever
future we all have left.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.890
Hey, Mitch.

27:37.924 --> 27:42.028
Did you know that Jamie is
keeping Mansdale prisoner

27:42.061 --> 27:43.395
in the bottom of this plane?

27:43.429 --> 27:45.732
Yeah.

27:45.765 --> 27:50.036
And, on the one hand,
it is dark and horrible.

27:50.069 --> 27:51.738
On the other hand,
the Shepherds did

27:51.771 --> 27:53.806
almost wipe out all of humanity.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.808
Oh, and also

27:55.842 --> 27:58.210
the whole vigilante thing
is kind of working for me.

27:58.244 --> 27:59.979
Mitch, this is not a joke.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.381
We have to keep an eye on her.

28:02.414 --> 28:05.051
Okay.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.253
(phone beeps)

28:07.286 --> 28:09.155
This is Dariela Kenyatta.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.923
LEANNE: I'm pleased
to hear from you.

28:10.957 --> 28:14.093
Have you considered my offer?

28:14.126 --> 28:18.831
Yes. The deal is on.

28:18.865 --> 28:21.167
By day's end,
you'll have Clementine Lewis.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.035
Perfect.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.704
And by day's end,
you'll be holding your son again.

28:30.342 --> 28:32.344
(phone vibrates, beeps)

28:41.053 --> 28:43.055
(protestors shouting)

28:45.257 --> 28:47.093
PROTESTOR: Evil people!

29:00.039 --> 29:02.041
(protestors shouting)

29:05.577 --> 29:07.413
I got the officer
coming through.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.025
(protestors shouting)

29:38.110 --> 29:40.379
Take this.
Use it to track the beacon.

29:40.412 --> 29:42.982
I've had luck blocking
the hybrid signal before,

29:43.015 --> 29:44.592
but this beacon is a
whole different beast.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.819
Okay, so we're gonna
work on a solution here

29:46.853 --> 29:48.897
and we'll talk you through
it once you find the beacon.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.389
ABRAHAM: In the meantime,

29:50.422 --> 29:54.093
use these things for
signal dampening.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.361
Wrap it in tinfoil.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.063
Use the copper wire to...

29:57.096 --> 29:58.931
Yeah, I got it.

29:58.965 --> 30:01.000
Make it all electric-y.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.237
(horns blaring)

30:06.873 --> 30:09.608
(tires screech)

30:09.641 --> 30:12.411
(tracker beeping)

30:12.444 --> 30:14.413
Okay, we're close.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.282
That thing's pretty slick.

30:16.315 --> 30:19.085
Dr. Abe just whipped it
up in a matter of minutes.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.153
You must be impressed.

30:21.187 --> 30:24.323
Well, it's not that amazing.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.092
You jealous of somebody
out-sciencing you?

30:26.125 --> 30:27.593
No.

30:27.626 --> 30:29.128
Well, maybe.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.297
Anyway,
he's got a ten-year jump on me.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.467
This way.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.004
Going somewhere?

30:38.037 --> 30:39.605
After all my
tune-ups, it turns out

30:39.638 --> 30:41.473
the truck is just missing
a fuel cell relay.

30:41.507 --> 30:44.143
It must've come loose when we
were getting out of that cabin.

30:44.176 --> 30:47.179
Luckily, I know a few
good garages in the area.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.315
I don't think you should
go out by yourself.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.658
(engine starts) Let
me come with you.

30:50.682 --> 30:54.053
(chuckles) I appreciate the
concern, but...

30:56.222 --> 30:58.457
I think I got this one.

31:03.095 --> 31:05.164
(siren wails)

31:07.566 --> 31:10.236
Abigail's setting off a
beacon inside Reiden Tower?

31:10.269 --> 31:11.904
What does she want with Reiden?

31:11.938 --> 31:13.172
I don't know.

31:13.205 --> 31:16.308
But somehow,
we got to get past these cops.

31:16.342 --> 31:17.944
Anybody got a plan for that?

31:21.147 --> 31:23.115
♪

31:27.453 --> 31:30.389
Coming through.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.391
I need you on your
best behavior in there.

31:32.424 --> 31:33.625
What, you don't trust me?

31:33.659 --> 31:36.028
These two are with me.

31:38.097 --> 31:40.266
MITCH: Boys, guess what?

31:40.299 --> 31:42.601
Abigail's gunning
for Reiden Tower.

31:42.634 --> 31:45.304
So whatever you're cooking
up, better make it fast.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.339
Yes, we're on it.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.944
Although it seems backwards,

31:51.978 --> 31:54.146
saving Reiden Tower.
We're not saving Reiden.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.220
We're saving New York City

31:55.247 --> 31:58.084
and,
perhaps the entire East Coast.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.252
All right, so, look,
this is hopefully

32:00.286 --> 32:02.354
what Mitch has access
to inside Reiden.

32:02.388 --> 32:06.392
Okay. We'll need to boost
our hybrid signal to match

32:06.425 --> 32:08.460
the intensity of the beacon.

32:08.494 --> 32:11.230
Lemon juice?

32:11.263 --> 32:14.333
It's a good conductor,
but why do we have so much?

32:14.366 --> 32:18.270
Apparently,
Jamie makes a mean Tom Collins.

32:20.206 --> 32:22.341
It's nice to know she had
so much time for hobbies

32:22.374 --> 32:24.210
in between destroying lives.

32:24.243 --> 32:25.244
(sniffs)

32:26.378 --> 32:29.415
You lost a lot because of
her, Abe.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.683
You need to stop
using me as an excuse.

32:31.717 --> 32:34.353
Jamie was just doing what
she thought was right.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.188
Despite everything
that's happened,

32:36.222 --> 32:38.190
I'm glad we're back together.

32:38.224 --> 32:42.494
No matter how messy it
gets, we're still a family.

32:42.528 --> 32:46.232
You, me, Jamie,
Dariela, Mitch...

32:46.265 --> 32:48.267
Clem.

32:50.436 --> 32:52.704
What's going on, Abe?

32:52.738 --> 32:54.306
What aren't you telling me?

32:56.608 --> 32:58.744
I need to find Dariela.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.679
Abe, we need to talk.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.414
I'll be right back.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.316
Just, uh,
use the electrical tape

33:04.350 --> 33:06.085
and the lemon juice, okay?

33:23.669 --> 33:26.305
Abe, there's something
I need to tell you.

33:26.338 --> 33:29.341
No, no.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.477
You were right.

33:31.510 --> 33:35.047
There's no way we can do this.

33:35.081 --> 33:37.549
No matter how much
we want Isaac back,

33:37.583 --> 33:40.352
we cannot betray Mitch and Clem.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.556
(sighs)

33:46.425 --> 33:49.261
No matter what
happens between us,

33:49.295 --> 33:51.463
Isaac is still our son.

33:51.497 --> 33:54.500
And we will find a
way to get him back.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.235
Together.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.371
Okay?

34:12.551 --> 34:14.152
MITCH: Guys, that's her.

34:14.186 --> 34:17.123
NYPD! Stop!

34:20.592 --> 34:22.437
This is Detective Hale.
I need a complete lockdown

34:22.460 --> 34:23.594
of Reiden Global now.

34:23.629 --> 34:24.830
(alarm blaring)

34:24.862 --> 34:26.665
Split up.

34:26.697 --> 34:27.909
When we find Abigail,
let me do my job.

34:27.933 --> 34:30.168
I don't need you going
all Kill Bill on her ass.

34:31.469 --> 34:32.504
Jamie?

34:32.538 --> 34:36.242
(alarm blaring)

34:39.378 --> 34:40.411
Logan, I got her.

34:40.446 --> 34:42.581
Southwest staircase, heading up.

35:04.903 --> 35:06.872
Mitch.

35:06.905 --> 35:08.540
How do you know my name?

35:10.442 --> 35:12.411
That's the least of
the things I know.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.316
Okay, wait.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.485
Uh, b-before you do that,

35:19.518 --> 35:21.653
let's, uh, let's talk this out.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.325
(device whirring)

35:26.358 --> 35:29.561
You're bound by the
edicts of the old order,

35:29.595 --> 35:31.597
but I'm going beyond.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.932
Beyond the constraints
of this planet,

35:33.965 --> 35:36.635
beyond the regime of humanity,

35:36.668 --> 35:40.339
beyond the concept of
life as you understand it.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.274
I'm going to create a new world.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.576
And I'm bringing
my hybrids with me.

35:44.610 --> 35:48.414
So you're like an evil
queen in a cartoon movie.

35:48.447 --> 35:50.516
You have a choice, Mitch.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.484
Between the old dead way

35:52.518 --> 35:53.819
and the beyond.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.321
It's time to make it.

35:55.354 --> 35:56.655
Wait, wait, no, no, no!

35:56.688 --> 35:58.190
No, don't... ah!
(footfalls departing)

36:02.694 --> 36:04.730
Logan, she activated the device.

36:04.763 --> 36:07.666
She's on the 15th floor.
You can still catch her.

36:14.840 --> 36:15.841
(tires screech)

36:19.378 --> 36:20.579
(engine turns off)

36:25.384 --> 36:26.384
(grunts)

36:27.386 --> 36:28.854
(tires screech)

36:38.397 --> 36:40.599
(line ringing)

36:40.632 --> 36:42.301
DARIELA: Hello?

36:42.334 --> 36:43.569
We got her.

36:43.602 --> 36:45.271
Take her to the drop.

36:45.304 --> 36:48.774
Once Leanne has her,
I'll send payment.

36:48.807 --> 36:49.808
(phone beeps)

36:54.546 --> 36:56.014
All right, Abe, Jackson.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.916
I'm ready for you.

36:57.949 --> 37:00.252
JACKSON: So you're gonna need
to find some electrical tape

37:00.286 --> 37:02.288
and then a whole
lot of lemon juice.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.589
(tracker beeping) What?

37:03.622 --> 37:05.857
Uh, guys?

37:05.891 --> 37:07.659
Either this thing's broken

37:07.693 --> 37:09.695
or there's a swarm of
hybrids heading for us.

37:11.029 --> 37:13.231
(hybrids screeching)

37:24.943 --> 37:26.912
NYPD. Freeze!

37:28.079 --> 37:30.282
(screeching in distance)

37:37.456 --> 37:38.456
(grunts)

37:54.606 --> 37:56.908
Okay. Got some tape.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.311
Don't know what I'm gonna
do about the lemon juice.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.715
We need to leave now.

38:03.749 --> 38:06.352
Little busy.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.320
Where's Jamie? Where's Abigail?

38:08.354 --> 38:10.389
I lost them both.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.791
You're a detective.
Go detect them.

38:12.824 --> 38:14.001
Hybrids have overrun
the building.

38:14.025 --> 38:15.627
We need to leave now.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.472
We're either gonna need a
whole lot of lemon juice

38:17.496 --> 38:18.497
or a whole new plan.

38:20.031 --> 38:21.767
Guess that means new plan.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.068
(muffled screeching)

38:24.069 --> 38:25.837
Wh-What?

38:25.871 --> 38:27.005
Oh! (bullets ricocheting)

38:30.041 --> 38:31.042
Are you crazy?!

38:31.076 --> 38:32.378
It was worth a shot.

38:32.411 --> 38:33.645
Was it?

38:33.679 --> 38:35.647
(banging, screeching continues)

38:35.681 --> 38:37.082
I have another idea.

38:43.088 --> 38:44.055
(gas hisses)

38:44.089 --> 38:46.091
Okay, we're good.

38:48.460 --> 38:50.629
What do you think,
middle of the Atlantic?

38:50.662 --> 38:52.063
Yeah.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.832
Let's see if these
turkeys can swim.

39:12.951 --> 39:15.153
It's actually working.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.155
Yeah. You're welcome.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.391
(screeching)

39:28.867 --> 39:30.436
(elevator bell
dings) Here's a tip:

39:30.469 --> 39:32.771
try firing your weapon at
bad guys instead of me.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.081
Maybe you'll lose less suspects.

39:34.105 --> 39:35.507
Thank you.

39:35.541 --> 39:37.509
Detective.
You should come with me.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.478
(protestors shouting)

39:39.511 --> 39:40.946
JACKSON: Something's wrong.

39:40.979 --> 39:43.615
The drone's losing altitude.

39:43.649 --> 39:45.517
Must be the battery.

39:45.551 --> 39:46.994
Can't handle the extra
weight of the beacon.

39:47.018 --> 39:48.787
Well, if we,
if we don't do something fast,

39:48.820 --> 39:50.489
it's not gonna make
it to the ocean.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.434
Do you think Jamie still
has that harpoon crossbow

39:52.458 --> 39:54.793
on the plane?

39:59.798 --> 40:01.800
(camera snapping)

40:09.508 --> 40:10.842
What the hell happened?

40:10.876 --> 40:13.979
She got popped while the
building was on lockdown.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.547
Do you have any suspects?

40:15.581 --> 40:17.483
Yeah, we got one in custody.

40:18.717 --> 40:20.586
She asked for you.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.693
Uh, no.
This has got to be a mistake.

40:27.726 --> 40:28.860
She's-she's with us.

40:28.894 --> 40:30.562
No, it's not.

40:30.596 --> 40:31.697
I did it.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.465
And I would do it again.

40:33.499 --> 40:35.501
She was The Falcon.

40:39.538 --> 40:40.639
(handcuffs rattle)

40:40.672 --> 40:42.140
You have the right
to remain silent.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.576
Is that really necessary?

40:44.610 --> 40:46.645
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

40:46.678 --> 40:48.723
in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney,

40:48.747 --> 40:51.082
and to have an attorney
present during any questioning.

40:53.084 --> 40:55.086
(phone ringing)

40:59.057 --> 41:00.859
Still no answer.

41:00.892 --> 41:03.261
(phone chimes) Nothing
from Dariela either.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.631
What the hell's going on?

41:05.664 --> 41:09.267
Reiden seems to be a no-show.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.136
And my black market contact

41:11.169 --> 41:13.104
says that there is
a bounty out on her

41:13.138 --> 41:16.241
for quadruple what
Dariela was paying, so...

41:16.274 --> 41:18.644
I think we can make
some money here.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.553
(air rushing)

41:27.953 --> 41:29.220
(alarm blaring)

41:32.123 --> 41:33.559
Good? You're good.

41:35.694 --> 41:37.663
The drone is losing altitude.

41:37.696 --> 41:38.830
Just a little lower.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.535
We need to fly below the drone.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.238
DARIELA: Here it comes!

41:49.207 --> 41:51.677
Don't fire until
the last minute.

41:51.710 --> 41:52.978
Okay.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.846
(hybrids screeching)

41:55.881 --> 41:56.982
Wait.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.017
Wait!

42:01.052 --> 42:02.153
There's the drone.

42:02.187 --> 42:03.555
Now!

42:05.356 --> 42:06.958
(line snaps)

42:06.992 --> 42:08.694
Aah!

42:10.629 --> 42:11.629
(grunting)

42:12.598 --> 42:14.099
We got you!

42:15.667 --> 42:16.702
(loud screeching)

42:16.735 --> 42:19.237
We got bigger problems.
