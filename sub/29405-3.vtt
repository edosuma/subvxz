00:01.602 --> 00:03.071
ANNOUNCER: Everyday heroes

00:03.104 --> 00:04.338
9-1-1 returns.

00:04.372 --> 00:05.506
We're gonna find you.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.141
ANNOUNCER: Catch

00:09.410 --> 00:11.912
Prodigal Son, Almost Family
and  The Resident.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.381
There's more to the story
than you know.

00:13.414 --> 00:14.948
Only on Fox.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.753
REPORTER:
The massive tsunami struck

00:19.787 --> 00:21.489
the Southern California
shoreline...

00:21.522 --> 00:23.157
(reporters' voices
overlapping)

00:23.191 --> 00:24.425
REPORTER:
First responders search

00:24.458 --> 00:26.260
for the many still missing
and feared dead.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.996
BUCK: Chris!
Christopher!

00:29.029 --> 00:31.332
Christopher!

00:31.365 --> 00:32.533
(dramatic music)

00:32.566 --> 00:34.668
(breathing heavily)

00:34.702 --> 00:36.337
Christopher!

00:36.370 --> 00:39.006
Has anyone seen a boy
in the water?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.841
Come on.
Hey!

00:40.874 --> 00:43.177
He's got brown hair, glasses,

00:43.211 --> 00:46.080
yellow T-shirt...

00:46.114 --> 00:47.581
have you seen a little boy?

00:47.615 --> 00:49.450
No, I'm sorry.

00:49.483 --> 00:53.187
(panting)

00:53.221 --> 01:00.128
*

01:06.834 --> 01:10.371
(grunting)

01:10.404 --> 01:17.411
*

01:38.632 --> 01:41.101
(sirens wail)

01:41.135 --> 01:44.972
(tense music)

01:46.274 --> 01:47.975
(birds squawking)

01:48.008 --> 01:50.644
Really?
You wanna do this here?

01:50.678 --> 01:52.580
Might as well end it
where it started, right?

01:52.613 --> 01:53.747
Scene of the crime,

01:53.781 --> 01:56.850
where you said "yes."

01:56.884 --> 01:59.920
I can't tell if your romantic
nostalgia is adorable

01:59.953 --> 02:01.489
or just sad.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.924
Five years, Stace.
We've come full circle.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.626
Literally.
The metaphor alone is--

02:05.659 --> 02:07.861
Look, Max, we're here
to sign divorce papers.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.463
And we will.

02:09.497 --> 02:13.201
No hard feelings, no drama,
but...

02:13.234 --> 02:14.768
(scoffs)

02:14.802 --> 02:18.472
Why not remember where it began
in the first place, right?

02:19.973 --> 02:22.343
-End on a high note.
-Yeah.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.282
MAX:
This is for all the marbles.

02:28.316 --> 02:31.285
(bright carnival music)

02:31.319 --> 02:37.725
*

02:43.197 --> 02:45.633
(desolate music)

02:45.666 --> 02:47.835
*

02:47.868 --> 02:49.970
The view's still amazing.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.072
It certainly is.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.974
And you're still just as bad
at flirting

02:54.007 --> 02:56.009
as you were back then.

02:57.511 --> 03:01.148
MAX: In the air,
it's like nothing's changed,

03:01.181 --> 03:03.584
same city, same water...

03:03.617 --> 03:05.353
Different people.

03:05.386 --> 03:12.159
*

03:12.192 --> 03:13.327
It's time.

03:13.361 --> 03:17.498
-Uh, I forgot my pen.
-I've got two.

03:17.531 --> 03:23.437
*

03:23.471 --> 03:24.872
STACEY:
And just like our marriage,

03:24.905 --> 03:27.841
this ride is
suddenly going nowhere.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.176
MAX:
I slipped the guy 50 bucks

03:29.209 --> 03:30.611
to give us a few minutes alone.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.047
STACEY:
That's a sweet gesture,

03:34.081 --> 03:35.616
but what did you think
would happen?

03:35.649 --> 03:40.388
I don't know,
some kind of sign, maybe.

03:40.421 --> 03:43.223
Signs are a thing.
Signs happen.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.360
In the movies, Max,
but not in real life.

03:46.394 --> 03:49.397
(siren blaring)

03:52.099 --> 03:54.402
Not the kind of sign
I was hoping for.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.136
(ominous music)

03:56.169 --> 03:57.538
(crowd clamoring)

03:57.571 --> 03:59.473
*

03:59.507 --> 04:01.108
Oh, my God, Max.

04:01.141 --> 04:08.081
*

04:09.783 --> 04:12.753
(wave crashing)

04:12.786 --> 04:18.258
*

04:18.292 --> 04:20.093
(glass shatters)

04:20.127 --> 04:23.096
(tense music)

04:23.130 --> 04:26.600
*

04:26.634 --> 04:28.636
WOMAN: Please help over here.
MAN: Please help.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.237
STACEY: Help!
We're here!

04:30.270 --> 04:33.907
Help!
I see boats, Max, rescue boats.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.343
Help's coming.

04:35.376 --> 04:38.412
*

04:38.446 --> 04:42.583
-I can't feel your hand.
-What?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.485
Yeah, I can't feel
much of anything.

04:44.518 --> 04:47.254
They'll fix it, Max.
Everything can be fixed.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.156
Not everything.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.660
MAN: Multiple calls
from the Ferris wheel, Captain.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.261
Okay, we're coming.

04:54.294 --> 05:00.934
*

05:00.968 --> 05:03.437
Hey, up here!
Help, here!

05:03.471 --> 05:04.672
My husband's hurt.
Please!

05:05.973 --> 05:07.841
MAN: Help these guys in front.
MAN: Copy.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.977
Move in here.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.380
All right, yeah.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.947
Let's go get them
right over there.

05:13.981 --> 05:17.951
*

05:17.985 --> 05:20.388
Oh, thank God you're here.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.956
We're save.
We'll be okay.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.193
-(speaks Spanish)
-(man speaking Spanish)

05:26.226 --> 05:27.361
Wait, who helped them?

05:27.395 --> 05:28.796
(speaks Spanish)

05:28.829 --> 05:30.297
Hey, we could use a hand
up here!

05:30.330 --> 05:33.834
*

05:33.867 --> 05:35.002
Fire lady.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.737
All right,
grab an extra harness,

05:36.770 --> 05:38.305
rope, pulleys,
figure eight plates.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.474
I'll coordinate evac
and transport some down here.

05:40.508 --> 05:43.143
EDDIE:
Sounds like a plan, Cap.

05:43.176 --> 05:50.083
*

05:52.853 --> 05:55.789
Okay.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.692
(clattering)

05:58.726 --> 06:00.160
(Ferris wheel squeaking)

06:00.193 --> 06:01.762
WOMAN: Oh, my God!
MAN: Oh, no!

06:01.795 --> 06:02.863
That's not part of the ride.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.432
No, the spokes are coming off
the hub.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.766
This thing's been thrashed.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.435
What about you?
Are you hurt?

06:07.468 --> 06:08.836
No, and neither is he.

06:08.869 --> 06:12.205
I'm not going anywhere,
not until the water's gone.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.207
Sir, if you don't come with us,
this whole thing will be gone.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.276
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm gonna get you down safely.

06:16.309 --> 06:19.179
I'm just gonna put
this harness around you, okay?

06:19.212 --> 06:21.515
Okay, okay.
All right.

06:21.549 --> 06:24.217
-Eddie Diaz, 118.
-Lena Bosko, 136.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.220
You were on the pit
when it hit.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.388
Yeah.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.560
-Where's your crew?
-LENA: Got separated...

06:32.593 --> 06:34.895
to all the spin cycle.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.029
All right.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.698
Let's get you up.
Let's get you up.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.032
-There we go.
-Okay.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.067
-There we go.
-Thank you.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.435
Be careful.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.936
(machinery creaking)

06:42.970 --> 06:44.572
Don't drop me.
Don't drop me.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.207
Oh, God!
Oh, God.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.610
(dramatic music)

06:49.643 --> 06:54.281
*

06:54.314 --> 06:55.549
WOMAN:
Oh, my God.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.051
(woman screaming)

06:58.085 --> 06:59.386
MAN: Get me in the boat.
Get me in the boat.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.054
RESPONDER: We've got you.
We've got you, just relax.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.556
We got you, sir.
We got you.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.157
*

07:04.191 --> 07:05.425
RESPONDER:
Watch your step.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.728
When the wave hit,
how'd you get back here?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.062
Swam.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.231
You sure did
and then you climbed.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.766
Free climb on the weekends,
soldier.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.902
How'd you know I was
in the service?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.403
You all carry yourselves
the same way.

07:16.436 --> 07:20.508
All that spit and polish.
My captain served, army.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.142
EDDIE:
Must be a good man.

07:22.175 --> 07:25.112
*

07:25.145 --> 07:26.947
EDDIE: Ma'am, stay put.
We're coming to you.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.516
STACEY: Thank you.
We're okay.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.083
LENA: Stay where you are.
We're coming.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.451
STACEY: Please hurry.
Hurry!

07:31.485 --> 07:34.154
LENA: Hold on.
Just a little bit longer.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.824
*

07:36.857 --> 07:39.426
-Oh, thank God you're here!
-What happened here, Ma'am?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.994
STACEY: He hit his neck
when the wave came,

07:41.028 --> 07:42.763
and he can't feel his fingers.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.097
MAX: My arms went numb.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.899
A couple minutes later,
my legs gave out.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.803
-Am I paralyzed?
-That's too soon to tell.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.104
You said you lost sensation
in your arms first

07:51.138 --> 07:52.172
and then your legs?

07:52.205 --> 07:53.306
-Yeah.
-EDDIE: Okay.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.307
Well, that might be a sign
of swelling,

07:54.341 --> 07:55.442
which means you bruised

07:55.475 --> 07:57.110
your neck instead
of breaking it.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.512
(metallic scraping)

07:58.546 --> 08:01.882
(all yelling)

08:03.517 --> 08:05.653
Hey, Cap,
we can get one down to you,

08:05.686 --> 08:07.454
but the other one's
a possible spinal.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.556
We're gonna need a Hail Mary.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.490
BOBBY:
I'll order one up for you.

08:10.524 --> 08:13.460
Coast guard, coast guard.
This is Captain Nash LAFD.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.495
We need a miracle at the pier.
We need one quick.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.531
You should be fine.
Help's on the way.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.032
All right.

08:19.066 --> 08:25.639
*

08:25.673 --> 08:28.909
(helicopter whirring)

08:28.942 --> 08:32.312
*

08:32.345 --> 08:35.315
You see, Max?
How's that for a sign?

08:35.348 --> 08:37.985
There's hope, so fight.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.855
*

08:41.889 --> 08:45.225
Max, you moved your fingers.

08:45.258 --> 08:48.195
I think I'm getting
some feeling back.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.063
You're gonna be okay.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.765
We're gonna be okay.

08:51.799 --> 08:54.902
Give me the pen, Stacey,

08:54.935 --> 08:56.369
and those papers.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.838
Max...

08:57.871 --> 09:01.008
We were always a disaster,
weren't we?

09:01.041 --> 09:04.011
(solemn music)

09:04.044 --> 09:10.951
*

09:13.754 --> 09:17.357
What a beautiful disaster
we were.

09:17.390 --> 09:24.097
*

09:25.065 --> 09:27.935
(dramatic music)

09:27.968 --> 09:34.775
*

09:34.808 --> 09:37.778
(helicopter whirring)

09:37.811 --> 09:44.752
*

09:54.962 --> 09:57.430
Incoming, debris!

09:57.464 --> 10:00.768
(metallic clanging)

10:03.170 --> 10:04.805
This thing is gonna go down.
Let's go.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.106
Go, go, go!

10:06.139 --> 10:08.575
Free climb,
how 'bout free fall?

10:08.608 --> 10:12.245
*

10:12.279 --> 10:13.981
(motor revving)

10:14.014 --> 10:20.854
*

10:22.489 --> 10:24.091
Here, here, here,
here, here, here.

10:24.124 --> 10:31.031
*

10:33.000 --> 10:36.036
(crashing)

10:42.375 --> 10:43.610
DISPATCHER: There's a truck
on its way, Captain.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.846
Copy that.
Nash out.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.381
Our team is still stuck
on the other side.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.283
Our trucks can't get through
just yet.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.485
Earth movers are still clearing
the roads.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.789
118's hoofing it for a while.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.290
It looks that way.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.460
Hen and Chimney are readying
some turnout backpacks

11:00.493 --> 11:02.963
until we're mobile again.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.799
Bosko, your crew
from your house are

11:05.833 --> 11:08.168
all alive and accounted for
except for Captain Cooper.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.402
He's still MIA.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.537
I'm sorry.

11:10.570 --> 11:11.972
Well, if it's all the same
to you, Captain,

11:12.005 --> 11:13.306
I'm gonna stick around
and look for him.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.142
Why are you holding yourself
like that?

11:15.175 --> 11:17.210
It's nothing, bruised rib.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.312
-Let me take a look at it.
-I said it's nothing.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.814
-Clearly, it's not.
-Are you gonna drop this?

11:20.848 --> 11:22.850
BOBBY: Hey, Bosko,
let him have a look.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.252
I'm not asking.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.821
(tense music)

11:27.855 --> 11:31.024
*

11:31.058 --> 11:34.527
Yeah, that's not a bruise.
It's broken.

11:34.561 --> 11:35.763
Must be hurting like a bitch.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.497
Yeah, well,
breathing isn't super fun.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.366
I'm calling it.
You're off the field.

11:39.399 --> 11:40.700
Sir, I said I'm fine.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.436
*

11:43.470 --> 11:46.506
USAR Command is setting up
the VA hospital on Sawtelle.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.508
I want you to stick with her
just in case her desire

11:48.541 --> 11:51.344
to track down her captain
causes her to lose her way.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.612
I'm gonna meet up with the 118.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.614
Rendezvous with us
when you can.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.516
EDDIE: Copy that, Cap.

11:56.549 --> 12:01.855
*

12:01.889 --> 12:04.024
-Who you calling?
-EDDIE: My son.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.026
Lost his mother
a few months ago,

12:06.059 --> 12:07.227
don't want him to worry.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.363
Hey, Buck, it's me.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.531
I just want you to tell
Christopher

12:11.564 --> 12:13.033
I'll be a little late
picking him up,

12:13.066 --> 12:15.135
got our hands full here.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.736
It's good thing
you're missing it.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.439
Hope you guys are having fun.

12:19.472 --> 12:22.075
*

12:22.109 --> 12:25.078
(engine puttering)

12:25.112 --> 12:26.713
(suspenseful music)

12:26.746 --> 12:30.250
WOMAN: Hey!
There's a kid under here!

12:30.283 --> 12:32.385
BUCK: Christopher?
Hey!

12:32.419 --> 12:35.488
Hey, guys...hey, hey, big guy!
Me and you, come on!

12:35.522 --> 12:38.325
All right, three, two, one.
Go!

12:38.358 --> 12:40.493
*

12:40.527 --> 12:43.230
Ah.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.898
MAN: Oh, my God.
WOMAN: I got you.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.566
MAN: Yeah! Yeah!
(applause)

12:46.599 --> 12:48.902
WOMAN: Okay.
Ooh, you're okay.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.603
WOMAN: Got you.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.305
Hey, hey, hey, excuse me.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.907
I'm looking for
an eight-year-old boy.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.475
His name is Christopher.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.444
He's always smiling,
and he's got CP,

12:57.477 --> 12:58.745
Cerebral Palsy.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.114
He's got brown hair,
yellow shirt.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.682
Yeah, yeah.
I think I saw him.

13:02.715 --> 13:03.984
Where?

13:04.017 --> 13:05.452
He was headed with a group
to that Cupcakery place.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.854
I heard they're handing out
water.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.788
Cupcakery, what is that?

13:08.822 --> 13:10.190
You know, cupcake bakery.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.492
It's about six or seven blocks
south of here on Strand.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.964
Thank you.
Thank you.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.599
*

13:19.632 --> 13:22.002
Dizziness, mild seizure,
in and out of consciousness--

13:22.035 --> 13:23.670
Tell the responders they may
be treating

13:23.703 --> 13:26.139
a subdural hematoma
and to mark it as a Code Three

13:26.173 --> 13:27.607
on the priority list.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.209
Before or after the guy
with the fishhook in his eye?

13:29.242 --> 13:30.978
(sighs)
Dealer's choice.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.612
Whoever they get to first.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.481
911, what's your emergency?

13:34.514 --> 13:36.316
LOUISE: Yes, I'm calling
from Kenosha, Wisconsin.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.717
My daughter is missing--

13:37.750 --> 13:39.119
Ma'am, I don't know how
you got put through to me,

13:39.152 --> 13:40.387
but this is Los Angeles.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.388
LOUISE: I know that.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.489
Joanna was texting me

13:42.522 --> 13:43.790
from her place
near the beach,

13:43.823 --> 13:45.125
but her texts became, like,
gibberish.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.559
And now,
I can't reach her at all.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.128
Okay, I understand.
Can I get your name?

13:48.161 --> 13:49.329
LOUISE: Louise Hickey.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.563
Louise, do you know
if your daughter is

13:50.597 --> 13:51.798
on any medications?

13:51.831 --> 13:53.066
LOUISE: She's a health nut.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.301
I don't even think
she takes aspirin.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.335
I know you're worried,

13:55.368 --> 13:56.469
but before you assume
the worst,

13:56.503 --> 13:57.570
there are a number of reasons

13:57.604 --> 13:58.872
Joanna's phone may have
stopped working,

13:58.906 --> 14:00.307
water damage alone.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.175
LOUISE: No, she was texting
after the tsunami.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.576
She and her neighbors were
all safe

14:03.610 --> 14:04.978
in the lounge
on the 10th floor.

14:05.012 --> 14:05.979
Can't you send somebody
over there?

14:06.013 --> 14:07.514
I'll see what I can do,

14:07.547 --> 14:09.016
but understand that
our first responders

14:09.049 --> 14:10.817
and emergency crews are
already stretched to the brink.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.319
LOUISE:
Please, whatever you can do.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.321
She's at the Ocean Plaza
Apartment Complex

14:14.354 --> 14:15.488
on Ocean Avenue.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.524
Ocean Plaza, right.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.826
Okay, you stay strong, Louise,
and let us know

14:19.859 --> 14:22.162
if you hear from your daughter.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.331
Hey, Linda, didn't I hear you
taking a call

14:24.364 --> 14:25.865
a little while ago,
something about

14:25.899 --> 14:27.600
the Ocean Plaza
Apartment Complex?

14:27.634 --> 14:30.170
Yeah, a caller was having
trouble reaching his boyfriend,

14:30.203 --> 14:31.939
said their phone conversation
cut off mid-sentence,

14:31.972 --> 14:33.273
then nothing.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.509
(tense music)

14:36.543 --> 14:39.446
*

14:39.479 --> 14:40.847
I checked the Red Cross
and social media

14:40.880 --> 14:42.849
to see if anyone
from Ocean Plaza had marked

14:42.882 --> 14:44.184
themselves as safe.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.353
Not one mention of it
anywhere.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.555
Let me see if I understand this
correctly.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.458
With everything we've got
on our plate,

14:51.491 --> 14:53.860
you wanna send help to the only
building in the area

14:53.893 --> 14:55.295
that isn't asking for any?

14:55.328 --> 14:57.897
Yeah, I guess I do.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.968
Please don't take offense,
but are you okay?

15:01.001 --> 15:02.402
Yes, Sue, I'm fine.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.071
But if something bad happened
at that address, and I didn't--

15:04.104 --> 15:06.639
I get it, but unless we can
confirm an emergency

15:06.673 --> 15:09.042
with someone on site,
our hands are tied, Maddie.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.910
We don't have the resources.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.713
*

15:13.746 --> 15:17.017
(drone buzzing)

15:18.751 --> 15:21.054
WOMAN:
Charlie, what are you doing?

15:21.088 --> 15:22.956
Looking for Reggie.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.491
WOMAN: You're not planning on
going outside?

15:24.524 --> 15:25.658
No.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.427
WOMAN:
It's still not safe out there.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.462
(dog barks distantly)

15:29.496 --> 15:30.964
(dramatic music)

15:30.998 --> 15:34.201
Oh, sick.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.940
Maddie,
I've got this kid on the line,

15:40.974 --> 15:43.010
but I can't tell whether or not
I'm being pranked.

15:43.043 --> 15:46.179
*

15:46.213 --> 15:47.580
Hi.
Who am I speaking with?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.416
CHARLOTTE:
Why do you need to know that?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.184
So I know what to call you.

15:51.218 --> 15:54.121
I just wanna know if you guys
know about the frogman.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.123
-Say again.
-CHARLOTTE: Frogman.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.125
He might be dead.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.626
He's in a tree,
but you can't see him

15:59.659 --> 16:00.627
from the street.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.929
Then how did you spot him?

16:02.962 --> 16:04.464
CHARLOTTE: With my drone.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.267
I'm looking for my friend.
His name's Reggie.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.935
-He's an artist--
-So you have a drone?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.271
CHARLOTTE:
DX-Black Bird R20.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.773
If you want, I can send you
a link to a live feed.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.942
Yes, please.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.679
I'm in.
There's movement.

16:19.712 --> 16:22.515
Dispatch a ladder crew
down to Rose and Third.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.850
Thank you, Charlotte.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.053
You may have just saved
a man's life.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.188
Wait, what?
How did you...

16:28.221 --> 16:29.989
MADDIE: We've got Caller ID,
a really good one.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.492
"Charlotte Rain Fingado,"
that's your name, isn't it?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.694
CHARLOTTE: It's Charlie.
Wow.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.329
You're like Big Brother's
big sister.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.830
Something like that.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.532
I think we can
help each other out.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.469
How far can your drone fly?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.471
(dramatic music)

16:44.504 --> 16:46.639
(drone buzzing)

16:46.673 --> 16:52.145
*

16:52.179 --> 16:54.314
Keep going, Charlie.
We need to find an opening.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.749
*

16:56.783 --> 16:58.818
I don't think
these windows open.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.354
No, but maybe
there's a vent or...

17:02.789 --> 17:03.856
There.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.592
Can you move in closer
or zoom in?

17:05.625 --> 17:06.659
CHARLOTTE: Zooming.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.062
What are we looking for,
again?

17:09.096 --> 17:13.733
*

17:13.766 --> 17:16.169
I think we found it.

17:16.203 --> 17:19.372
*

17:25.378 --> 17:27.247
ATHENA: All right,
y'all have your assignments.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.682
Fan out,
make your presence known.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.618
Might take the national guard
more than a minute

17:31.651 --> 17:32.919
to get on the stick.

17:32.952 --> 17:35.288
Until then, we are
the first line of defense

17:35.322 --> 17:37.090
against looters, all right?

17:37.124 --> 17:38.758
If you see anything
that looks like

17:38.791 --> 17:41.194
more than a misdemeanor,
call for backup.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.230
We are not looking
the other way on this.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.598
Arrests will be made.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.367
Understood?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.701
All right, move out.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.571
Be smart, stay safe.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.973
(sirens whooping)

17:54.006 --> 17:55.875
Hey, everything okay, Suze?

17:55.908 --> 17:58.211
Sergeant, they're asking
for help finding their people.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.212
I tried to tell them--

17:59.246 --> 18:00.313
Folks, for your own safety,

18:00.347 --> 18:01.714
we need you to clear
the streets.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.650
Make your way
to the emergency shelter.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.051
My wife is missing,

18:05.084 --> 18:06.386
and you're not gonna do
anything?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.388
We are doing everything
that we can.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.589
Now, there are people
at the shelter

18:09.622 --> 18:11.090
who can take your name
and reconnect you

18:11.124 --> 18:13.626
with your wife
or whoever is missing.

18:13.660 --> 18:17.397
DISPATCHER: 7-2-7-L-30.
7-2-3-L-30, come back.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.598
Muchas gracias.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.835
Dispatch, 7-2-7-L-30.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.605
DISPATCHER: Multiple reports

18:25.638 --> 18:29.008
MAN: Hey, everyone,
fresh water to your left,

18:29.041 --> 18:30.843
first aid and blankets
to the right.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.679
(baby cries)

18:32.712 --> 18:35.348

18:35.382 --> 18:41.321

18:42.455 --> 18:43.623
Christopher.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.091
(relieved sigh)

18:45.124 --> 18:47.327
Christopher!
I'm here.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.828
Hey, Christopher!

18:48.861 --> 18:51.831

18:51.864 --> 18:58.171

18:59.138 --> 19:02.108

19:02.141 --> 19:05.044

19:05.077 --> 19:07.113
BOY:
Mister, are you okay?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.315
You're bleeding.

19:08.348 --> 19:13.986
*

19:14.020 --> 19:15.622
(Buck grunting)

19:15.655 --> 19:18.325
BOY: Can I get you something
for that?

19:19.992 --> 19:22.161
(ominous music)

19:22.195 --> 19:24.797
Sword of Damocles
at 12:00, Cap.

19:24.831 --> 19:25.965
I see it.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.468
John, can you get
some caution tape up

19:28.501 --> 19:30.570
around that streetlamp before
somebody gets nailed by it?

19:30.603 --> 19:34.507
*

19:34.541 --> 19:36.042
Okay,
until we know what's what,

19:36.075 --> 19:37.977
masks go on and they stay on.

19:38.010 --> 19:44.917
*

19:47.019 --> 19:48.355
(door thuds)

19:48.388 --> 19:52.992

19:53.025 --> 19:55.027
HEN: Schematics put
the stairs over...

19:55.061 --> 19:56.663

19:56.696 --> 19:58.331
CO.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.032
CHIMNEY: A hell of a lot of it,
212 PPMs.

20:00.066 --> 20:03.002
BOBBY: Okay, Hen, Geary,
check building maintenance,

20:03.035 --> 20:04.036
central heating units.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.338
Find the source
and shut it down.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.674
Everybody else on me.
Dispatch to tenth floor.

HEN: Copy that.

-RAFI: Ah!

20:16.215 --> 20:19.419
Ah, I'm not falling for it...
who's the mess about?

20:19.452 --> 20:21.187
Sir.
Sir, we are here to help.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.355
Try to calm yourself.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.923
You're suffering
from carbon monoxide poisoning.

20:23.956 --> 20:28.528
Need to
very much...nomenclature.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.196
(sniffs, retches)

20:30.229 --> 20:31.698
CHIMNEY:
Did he just say "nomenclature"?

20:31.731 --> 20:33.766
BOBBY:
All right, get him outside.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.568
Residents must have taken
higher ground

20:35.602 --> 20:37.537
as the water rose.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.639
CHIMNEY:
Unfortunately, the gas did too.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.041
Concentration is highest
here at the top.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.710
Let's hope we're not
too late to the party.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.878
*

20:45.912 --> 20:47.614
Okay, let's go, go, go.

20:47.647 --> 20:50.483
(gas hissing)

20:50.517 --> 20:53.953
Got a pulse here, it's steady,
but her face has discoloration.

20:53.986 --> 20:56.323
BOBBY: All right, we gotta get
some fresh air in here ASAP.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.824
(glass shatters)

20:57.857 --> 20:59.559
HEN: Building's backup
generator got damaged

20:59.592 --> 21:00.727
by the seawater.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.662
We managed to put it
out of its misery.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.764
Okay, start bringing them down,
get 'em on O2.

21:06.198 --> 21:07.900
This is Ladder 118,
Captain Nash

21:07.934 --> 21:09.402
requesting medical transport

21:09.436 --> 21:11.904
at Ocean Plaza
Apartment Complex,

21:11.938 --> 21:14.106
nine-nine Ocean,
north entrance for--

21:14.140 --> 21:15.508
17 minimum, Cap.

21:15.542 --> 21:19.145
At least 17 patients,
acute CO poisoning, ASAP.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.813
DISPATCHER:
Copy request, Ladder 118.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.915
All ambulances
currently engaged.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.318
-Stand by.
-Standing by.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.587
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
You shouldn't get up.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.921
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

21:28.955 --> 21:29.922
I just need...

21:29.956 --> 21:31.624
Hey, okay.
Hold on, I got you.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.593
I need to call my mom.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.428
I need to call...

21:35.462 --> 21:37.464
did you take my phone?

21:37.497 --> 21:38.931
What's your name?

21:38.965 --> 21:39.932
"Jonana."

21:39.966 --> 21:41.601
-Joanna?
-Yeah, that's it.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.970
Okay, Joanna, I'm Hen.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.305
You can call your mom
once you get settled

21:46.339 --> 21:47.440
at the hospital, okay?

21:47.474 --> 21:48.441
Okay.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.109
Right now, you should sit down.

21:50.142 --> 21:53.546
I just wanna sit over--ah!

21:53.580 --> 21:55.114
Okay, all right.
Okay, are you okay?

21:55.147 --> 21:57.450
-What's hurting?
-My ankle.

21:57.484 --> 22:01.220
I cut it yesterday at the gym.
The water's making it sting.

22:01.253 --> 22:04.223
(suspenseful music)

22:04.256 --> 22:08.060
*

22:08.094 --> 22:10.997
(electricity zapping)

22:12.599 --> 22:14.734
-Bobby?
-Yeah.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.736
*

22:16.769 --> 22:20.039
Bobby, we gotta find a way
to move all these people.

22:20.072 --> 22:21.641
Already on it,
just gonna take some time

22:21.674 --> 22:22.875
for the ambulances to get here.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.176
We don't have time.

22:24.210 --> 22:25.645
That gas truck down the street,

22:25.678 --> 22:27.880
it's leaking gasoline
into the water.

22:27.914 --> 22:31.484
*

22:31.518 --> 22:33.520
We're standing on top
of a bomb.

22:39.225 --> 22:40.192
DISPATCHER: Be advised,

22:40.226 --> 22:41.193
full evacuation in effect

22:41.227 --> 22:42.328
in national park.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.863
Looters reported
in the prospect.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.198
ATHENA: Copy that.

22:46.232 --> 22:47.500
(tense music)

22:47.534 --> 22:50.503
(dog barking distantly)

22:50.537 --> 22:52.872
*

22:52.905 --> 22:55.608
(sirens wail,
helicopter whirs distantly)

22:55.642 --> 23:01.013
*

23:01.047 --> 23:02.682
(car door slams)

23:02.715 --> 23:04.116
-TITO: Did you get 'em all?
-Yeah.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.852
We should check next door.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.020
Saw a couple of silver bowls
through the window.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.922
TITO: We're hauling as much
as we can carry already, man.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.090
I don't think we can fit
no more.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.258
ATHENA: LAPD.

23:12.291 --> 23:13.760
Both of you,
put your hands in the air.

23:13.793 --> 23:17.029
(anxious music)

23:17.063 --> 23:19.198
You wanna drop that box, Boss?

23:19.231 --> 23:21.200
Uh...I can't.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.603
Oh, I bet you can.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.137
-I don't wanna scare 'em.
-ATHENA: Scare who?

23:25.171 --> 23:28.608
*

23:28.641 --> 23:31.611
(cats purring)

23:31.644 --> 23:35.548
*

23:35.582 --> 23:36.716
(cat mews)

23:36.749 --> 23:40.553
*

23:40.587 --> 23:42.388
(dog whines)

23:42.421 --> 23:44.056
You're looting animals?

23:44.090 --> 23:45.558
TITO: Looting?

23:45.592 --> 23:48.294
No, eh, we're saving 'em.

23:48.327 --> 23:50.262
Look, check it out.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.000
See?
Yeah.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.235
We reunite owners
with pets who get separated

23:56.268 --> 23:59.772
during natural disasters,
fires, those sorts of things.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.674
We call ourselves
The Raiders of the Lost Barks.

24:01.708 --> 24:02.742
TITO: No, we don't.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.410
Ray, we talked about this.
Come on.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.178
-RAY: I'm just trying it out.
-TITO: Yeah, it's lame.

24:06.212 --> 24:07.680
ATHENA: You two have ID on you?

24:07.714 --> 24:14.621
*

24:17.624 --> 24:19.258
Much as I appreciate
your cause,

24:19.291 --> 24:21.761
I can't let you just break
into people's houses.

24:21.794 --> 24:25.164
You see, technically,
we're not really breaking in.

24:25.197 --> 24:27.199
You'd be surprised
how many homeowners leave

24:27.233 --> 24:29.001
their windows
and backdoors unlocked.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.503
Yeah, you should see Ray here
navigate himself

24:30.537 --> 24:31.938
through the occasional
doggy door.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.606
I'm double-jointed.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.774
Yeah?

24:34.807 --> 24:37.443
Well, technically,
it's still a felony.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.445
Okay, I tell you what.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.448
Overheard you say
you got more than you can fit.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.117
I think it's best if you boys
just take care

24:45.151 --> 24:46.285
of your present cargo.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.187
Leave the rest for the ASPCA.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.522
-TITO: Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.290
-Thank you.
-Have a good night.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.059
TITO: You too.
RAY: Yeah.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.996
TITO: Come on, man.
"Raiders of the Lost Bark."

24:57.029 --> 24:58.230
You lost your mind,
think I'm gonna walk around

24:58.264 --> 24:59.465
with a shirt...

24:59.498 --> 25:01.500
RAY: It's a good name.
TITO: It's not.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.638
(metallic clang)

25:05.672 --> 25:08.641
(suspenseful music)

25:08.675 --> 25:11.644

25:11.678 --> 25:17.316
*

25:17.349 --> 25:19.385
EDDIE: Hey.
Hey!

25:19.418 --> 25:21.220
My friend's got at least one
broken rib and showing signs--

25:21.253 --> 25:22.555
NURSE: Can I get your names
for the list, please?

25:22.589 --> 25:24.190
You have a list?

25:24.223 --> 25:25.224
-Excuse me.
-EDDIE: Lena.

25:25.257 --> 25:26.258
Lena.

25:26.292 --> 25:27.560
First we get you fixed up,

25:27.594 --> 25:29.095
then you can spiral out.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.263
I'm Eddie Diaz.
This is Lena Bosko.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.432
Have you seen a Ronnie Cooper
on the list?

25:33.465 --> 25:35.902
Fire captain, station 136.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.536
I haven't.

25:37.570 --> 25:39.505
Head on inside
and someone will be with you.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.508
(solemn music)

25:42.541 --> 25:45.511
*

25:45.544 --> 25:47.747
(machine beeps)

25:47.780 --> 25:50.082
WOMAN: Don't be scared, baby.
I'm fine.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.350
It doesn't hurt.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.519
I'm gonna need more gauze.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.555
Okay, Diaz, you got your wish.
I'm here.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.557
You don't have to babysit me.

25:58.591 --> 25:59.859
Yeah, I get it.
If my captain was out there--

25:59.892 --> 26:02.194
Coop's not just my captain,
okay?

26:02.228 --> 26:04.430
He believed in me.
He made me who I am.

26:06.599 --> 26:08.367
(machine beeps)

26:08.400 --> 26:09.902
He remind you of your son?

26:09.936 --> 26:11.370
I guess a little.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.404
(Kyle coughing)

26:12.438 --> 26:14.206
Sorry about his mom.
That's rough.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.709
-(Kyle coughing, gagging)
-WOMAN: Kyle, what's wrong?

26:16.743 --> 26:18.277
-He's drowning.
-WOMAN: What?

26:18.310 --> 26:21.447
(Kyle gasping, coughing)

26:21.480 --> 26:25.084
(tense music)

26:25.117 --> 26:26.953
(gurgling)

26:26.986 --> 26:29.588
WOMAN: What's in his mouth?

26:29.622 --> 26:31.624
-(gagging)
-WOMAN: Oh, my God.

26:31.658 --> 26:35.427
(gasps)
Kyle, baby, I'm here.

26:35.461 --> 26:37.096
Short breaths, Kyle.
Nice and easy.

26:37.129 --> 26:39.598
Nice and easy.
All right, on three.

26:39.632 --> 26:42.601
One, two, three.

26:44.136 --> 26:45.504
MEDIC: Get him to X-ray.

26:45.537 --> 26:48.908
See which pulmonary specialist
is available.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.309
(peaceful music)

26:50.342 --> 26:51.978
WOMAN: Thank you.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.747
Delayed secondary drowning.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.448
I've never seen one of those.

26:56.482 --> 26:58.617
Good catch.

26:58.651 --> 26:59.686
Paramedic?

26:59.719 --> 27:01.087
No, but I was a medic
in the service.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.255
In case you couldn't tell,
we are severely shorthanded.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.523
Any chance that you could--

27:04.556 --> 27:06.192
Yeah, sure, just point me
where to wash up.

27:06.225 --> 27:09.261
Sorry, looks like you're not
getting rid of me anytime soon.

Hello?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.609
-Hey.
-MAN: Yes?

27:23.642 --> 27:25.111
Here.

Hey, hang in there.
I'm coming to you.

27:27.513 --> 27:31.150
(clanging, clattering)

27:31.183 --> 27:33.853
(grunts)
Hold on, hold on.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.221
*

27:35.254 --> 27:37.990
I got you.

27:39.225 --> 27:40.292
Captain.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.061
Aren't you a sight
for sore eyes?

27:44.363 --> 27:45.698
(gasps)

27:45.732 --> 27:47.734
Who says there's never a cop
around when you need one?

27:47.767 --> 27:49.736
Okay, you hang on.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.470
I'm gonna get you out of here.

27:51.503 --> 27:55.141
7-2-7-L-30 requesting
immediate medical assistance

27:55.174 --> 27:57.676
near the corner
of 18th and Wellesley Drive.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.211
DISPATCHER:
Copy request, L-30.

27:59.245 --> 28:02.815
Be advised, EMTs approximately
30-35 minutes out.

28:02.849 --> 28:05.017
Too long, too late.

28:05.051 --> 28:07.754
Do what you can to shave down
that estimate, Central.

28:07.787 --> 28:11.824
*

28:11.858 --> 28:14.326
We'll see if I can find
a jack to free your arm.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.361
COOPER:
My arm's gone.

28:15.394 --> 28:18.064
I belted if off hours ago.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.399
It's already gone numb.

28:20.432 --> 28:24.003
You carrying any kind of knife,
cutting tool...

28:24.036 --> 28:25.337
maybe in your car?

28:25.371 --> 28:27.006
Not unless you count
a nail file.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.174
(half-hearted laugh)

28:28.207 --> 28:30.209
I'm afraid that's not
gonna do it.

28:30.242 --> 28:31.577
What are we talking about?

28:33.045 --> 28:36.082
You're gonna have to finish
amputating my arm.

28:36.115 --> 28:38.450
*

28:38.484 --> 28:40.452
(foreboding music)

28:40.486 --> 28:41.720
BOBBY: Okay,
what's our current status?

28:41.754 --> 28:44.223
About a third of them are
semi or unconscious.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.759
Picked up arrhythmia in four,
others are coming around.

28:46.793 --> 28:49.228
There's a lot of complaints
about headaches and dizziness.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.563
-Casualties?
-Two so far.

28:51.597 --> 28:52.865
Any word on our ride?

28:52.899 --> 28:54.633
No, it's been 20 minutes
since I sent Chimney and John

28:54.666 --> 28:56.035
on a bus hunt.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.770
I think it's time we start
walking some of these people

28:57.804 --> 28:59.238
out of this area.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.107
And what about the seven or so
that aren't ambulatory?

29:01.140 --> 29:02.208
-I'll stay here with 'em.
-Uh-uh.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.976
That's for me to do.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.912
(electricity zapping)

29:05.945 --> 29:07.046
(flames roar)

29:07.079 --> 29:08.580
Why don't you get these
people up,

29:08.614 --> 29:09.949
get them ready to move?

29:11.250 --> 29:12.718
This is Nash
for Chimney and John.

29:12.751 --> 29:13.886
Have you found us a bus?

29:13.920 --> 29:16.222
Chimney,
we need transpo right now.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.390
CHIMNEY: Copy, Skip.
Coming in.

29:18.424 --> 29:19.758
(car horn honks)

29:19.792 --> 29:21.660
*

29:21.693 --> 29:23.562
(honking)

29:23.595 --> 29:28.467
*

29:28.500 --> 29:31.170
Neither rain nor snow
nor heat nor tsunamis

29:31.203 --> 29:33.672
stays this couriers
from their appointed rounds.

29:33.705 --> 29:35.107
Tell me you didn't steal
these mail trucks

29:35.141 --> 29:36.242
just so you could say that.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.643
CHIMNEY: Hey, these were
the only things

29:37.676 --> 29:39.011
that weren't swamped,
parked in the PO garages,

29:39.045 --> 29:40.012
safe and dry.

29:40.046 --> 29:41.113
Careful.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.949
Okay, everybody in back.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.817
Geary, Forrest,
let's load 'em up.

29:44.851 --> 29:51.790
*

29:53.692 --> 29:56.462
LAPD.
Anybody home?

29:57.830 --> 29:59.498
Hello?

30:00.833 --> 30:02.468
Lord, forgive me.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.603
(glass shatters)

30:04.636 --> 30:07.606
(dramatic music)

30:07.639 --> 30:14.546
*

30:16.148 --> 30:17.950
(Cooper grunts softly)

30:17.984 --> 30:23.155
*

30:23.189 --> 30:24.891
You weren't specific.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.625
It's bad enough I looted
somebody's house.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.328
I wasn't about to come back
here with the wrong thing.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.898
Use the shears.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.299
Bone's already broken,

30:33.332 --> 30:35.167
so you're just cutting through
soft tissue.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.502
Maybe a tendon or two.

30:36.535 --> 30:37.803
Don't say "just."

30:37.836 --> 30:39.305
There's nothing "just"
about cutting off

30:39.338 --> 30:42.074
somebody's arm.

30:42.108 --> 30:44.143
I'd have thought somebody who
reached the rank of sergeant

30:44.176 --> 30:45.577
would have seen worse
than this.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.146
Seen?
Yeah.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.747
Contributed?

30:48.780 --> 30:51.150
That's more
my husband's domain.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.584
What is he, a doctor?

30:52.618 --> 30:56.755
Fire captain like yourself.
Bobby Nash, station 118.

30:56.788 --> 30:59.758
No kidding.
What's your name?

30:59.791 --> 31:02.929
Athena.
Athena Grant.

31:02.962 --> 31:06.598
Ronnie Cooper, station 136.

31:06.632 --> 31:09.335
You may wanna get started.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.403
This arm's not gonna amputate
itself.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.072
That's not funny, Ronnie.

31:13.105 --> 31:15.874
(suspenseful music)

31:15.908 --> 31:17.543
Is there somebody
you wanna call

31:17.576 --> 31:19.011
before we do this?

31:19.045 --> 31:21.513
Your wife?

31:21.547 --> 31:25.117
No, Ellen already knows
I'm missing by now.

31:25.151 --> 31:26.618
If something went wrong,

31:26.652 --> 31:29.188
it'd be like
I died on her twice.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.357
*

31:31.390 --> 31:33.392
(gasps)

31:35.094 --> 31:38.630
Here.
Bite down on this.

31:38.664 --> 31:44.203
*

31:44.236 --> 31:45.571
(exhales)

31:45.604 --> 31:48.574
*

31:48.607 --> 31:51.543
(Cooper moaning)

31:51.577 --> 31:55.747
*

31:55.781 --> 31:57.316
(moans)

31:57.349 --> 31:59.551
*

31:59.585 --> 32:00.652
(body tissue squelches)

32:00.686 --> 32:03.822
(muffled Cooper yelling)

32:03.855 --> 32:07.159
(tense music)

32:07.193 --> 32:09.895
*

32:09.928 --> 32:10.997
We gotta go!

32:11.030 --> 32:12.564
-One minute!
-We don't have a minute.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.233
-Chimney!
-Copy that.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.667
John!

32:15.701 --> 32:22.174
*

32:23.209 --> 32:24.576
(ignition turns over)

32:24.610 --> 32:26.012
Okay, let's hit it!

32:26.045 --> 32:30.582
*

32:30.616 --> 32:33.585
(explosion booming)

32:33.619 --> 32:40.092
*

32:40.126 --> 32:41.593
Hey, Cap,
you all okay back there?

32:41.627 --> 32:43.595
Yeah, we got kissed a bit,
but we're fine.

32:43.629 --> 32:44.930
That was way too close.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.498
Wait, watch out!

32:46.532 --> 32:48.967
(tires screech)

32:49.001 --> 32:51.970
(dramatic music)

32:52.004 --> 32:54.106
We're gonna need
a bigger mail truck.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.441
*

32:55.474 --> 32:57.843
(coughing, sobbing)

33:04.016 --> 33:05.317
It looks like you're gonna have
to get used to being

33:05.351 --> 33:07.486
a southpaw for the time being.

33:07.519 --> 33:09.955
Best time to work on
your change-up and curveball.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.059
(siren whoops)

33:13.092 --> 33:14.460
So you a pitcher too?

33:14.493 --> 33:16.795
Class A regional all-star,
two years straight.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.830
Naturally.
You all fixed up?

33:18.864 --> 33:20.866
All taped up, pain killed,
and rarin' to get back out.

33:20.899 --> 33:22.634
You gotta be kidding me.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.203
My captain's still somewhere
out there.

33:24.236 --> 33:25.671
And there are already people
looking for him.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.706
-There's gonna be one more.
-Man, you're stubborn.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.141
You can try to stop me,
if you wanna know exactly

33:29.175 --> 33:31.243
what two broken ribs
feels like.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.679
*

33:33.712 --> 33:35.981
(siren wails)

33:36.014 --> 33:38.250
EDDIE: Hey, Athena.

33:38.284 --> 33:41.019
It's not my blood.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.421
It's his.

33:42.454 --> 33:43.689
Coop?

33:43.722 --> 33:45.991
Ronnie, can you hear me?

33:46.024 --> 33:48.360
-Bosko.
-(sighs in relief)

33:48.394 --> 33:51.997
-You're okay.
-LENA: Yeah, the crew is too.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.566
(emotional music)

33:56.935 --> 33:59.905
(sirens wailing)

33:59.938 --> 34:02.541
(dramatic music)

34:02.574 --> 34:09.481
*

34:11.049 --> 34:13.852
Hey, excuse me.
I'm looking for a kid.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.921
He's got brown hair.
Chris--Christopher.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.256
How old?

34:17.289 --> 34:19.091
Um, eight, maybe nine.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.859
Christopher Diaz.
He has CP.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.694
Christopher Diaz.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.596
No, not here.

34:24.630 --> 34:28.066
You may wanna check over there
at the black tent.

34:28.100 --> 34:31.937
*

34:31.970 --> 34:34.906
-Isn't that the...
-The morgue.

34:34.940 --> 34:36.875
Excuse me.

34:36.908 --> 34:40.612
*

34:42.614 --> 34:45.584
(somber music)

34:45.617 --> 34:51.423
*

34:51.457 --> 34:53.559
SUE: Maddie.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.060
That name you had me
looking into, Reggie--

34:55.093 --> 34:56.895
Reginald Simmons.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.630
Yeah, Charlie,
the girl with the drone,

34:58.664 --> 35:00.399
she was just hoping we could
locate him.

35:00.432 --> 35:03.602
His body was identified
by a recovery crew.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.404
He drowned.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.072
Oh.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.440
I'm sorry.

35:08.474 --> 35:10.409
-No, um...it's okay.
-(phone buzzing)

35:10.442 --> 35:12.844
Thanks.
Excuse me.

35:12.878 --> 35:14.413
Hello?

35:14.446 --> 35:15.914
BUCK: Hey, it's me.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.649
Buck?
Where are you?

35:17.683 --> 35:19.084
I don't know this number.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.952
I borrowed
someone else's phone.

35:20.986 --> 35:22.754
Maddie, I need your help.

35:22.788 --> 35:25.991
Okay, tell me what's wrong.
Are you hurt?

35:26.024 --> 35:29.094
BUCK: Eddie dropped
Christopher off with me.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.164
He thought, you know,
doing some activities with him

35:32.198 --> 35:35.100
would get me
out of my apartment...

35:35.133 --> 35:36.935
out of my head.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.004
Maddie,
I brought him to the pier.

35:39.037 --> 35:40.806
Oh, my God, you were there?

35:40.839 --> 35:43.108
BUCK: And I had him.
All right, Mads?

35:43.141 --> 35:45.644
I had him.
I kept him safe.

35:46.812 --> 35:50.482
We were--uh...we were
on top of the ladder truck,

35:50.516 --> 35:52.184
then the water receded...

35:52.218 --> 35:53.619
MADDIE: Okay,
you're not answering me.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.787
Are you injured, bleeding?

35:55.821 --> 35:57.022
BUCK: No, it doesn't matter.

35:57.055 --> 35:59.191
Don't you hear
what I am saying?

35:59.225 --> 36:03.829
Christopher is gone.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.997
I've checked
the emergency refugee camps

36:06.031 --> 36:08.133
at the Promenade,
at the high school--

36:08.166 --> 36:09.968
Okay, did you check
the VA hospital?

36:10.001 --> 36:12.137
The Command Center,
you know, on Sawtelle?

36:12.170 --> 36:14.139
I'm here now and he...

36:14.172 --> 36:16.808
(dramatic music)

36:16.842 --> 36:18.477
*

36:18.510 --> 36:20.011
Oh, God.
God, God, no.

36:20.045 --> 36:21.380
MADDIE: What?

36:21.413 --> 36:23.315
(exhales)

36:23.349 --> 36:24.850
Eddie's here.

36:24.883 --> 36:26.385
MADDIE:
Does he know what happened?

36:26.418 --> 36:28.053
*

36:28.086 --> 36:30.489
-Evan, you have to tell him.
-BUCK: How?

36:30.522 --> 36:31.990
How do you tell
your best friend

36:32.023 --> 36:33.325
that you lost his son?

36:33.359 --> 36:35.026
No, no, no.
He's his father.

36:35.060 --> 36:37.663
Okay, you have to tell him
that Christopher's missing.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.065
No, Maddie, I need
to keep on looking for him.

36:40.098 --> 36:41.333
I need to find him.

36:41.367 --> 36:43.369
Look, you are in no condition
to go looking

36:43.402 --> 36:45.203
for Christopher by yourself.

36:45.237 --> 36:47.205
-I'm coming down there.
-BUCK: No, no.

36:47.239 --> 36:49.708
Maddie!
Maddie!

36:51.042 --> 36:54.012
(tense music)

36:54.045 --> 36:59.385
*

36:59.418 --> 37:01.186
Need some help here!

37:01.219 --> 37:03.188
*

37:03.221 --> 37:06.024
Buck?
Wait, what are you doing here?

37:06.057 --> 37:08.226
Are you okay?
Wait, where's Christopher?

37:08.260 --> 37:09.928
Eddie...

37:09.961 --> 37:11.897
MAN:
We need a gurney over here.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.267
Why do you have his glasses?

37:15.301 --> 37:18.370
(solemn music)

37:18.404 --> 37:22.474
We, um...

37:22.508 --> 37:25.043
(stammering)
me and Christopher,

37:25.076 --> 37:29.715
we were...at the beach,

37:29.748 --> 37:32.951
and--um...and listen to me,
okay?

37:32.984 --> 37:36.288
I swear to you...

37:36.322 --> 37:39.057
okay, I tried...

37:39.090 --> 37:41.927
*

37:41.960 --> 37:46.298
And I just...but I...

37:46.332 --> 37:48.934
Eddie, I just don't know
how to say it.

37:48.967 --> 37:52.070
He--he just--he...

37:52.103 --> 37:53.104
he just vanished.

37:53.138 --> 37:55.474
-Christopher?
-Hey.

37:55.507 --> 38:00.612
*

38:00.646 --> 38:01.813
EDDIE: Christopher?

38:01.847 --> 38:04.316
CHRISTOPHER: Dad!
EDDIE: Oh, my God!

38:04.350 --> 38:07.319
(emotional music)

38:07.353 --> 38:09.755
*

38:09.788 --> 38:11.590
Thank you.
Thank you.

38:11.623 --> 38:12.824
You're Buck?

38:12.858 --> 38:15.494
No, I'm his father, Eddie.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.996
He was looking for Buck.

38:18.029 --> 38:20.632
-(exhales)
-CHIMNEY: Make a hole!

38:20.666 --> 38:22.934
Buck, what happened to you?

38:22.968 --> 38:25.771
*

38:25.804 --> 38:27.439
Hey.

38:27.473 --> 38:33.011
*

38:33.044 --> 38:36.114
You two okay?

38:36.147 --> 38:38.116
Yeah, we're great.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.918
CHIMNEY: Oh.
HEN: Wait, hold up.

38:41.219 --> 38:43.221
-(Buck grunts)
-BOBBY: Come here.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.458
Hang in there.
Hang in there, bro.

38:46.492 --> 38:48.560
*

38:54.500 --> 38:57.469
(Ed Sheeran's "Photograph")

38:57.503 --> 38:58.670
*

38:58.704 --> 39:02.741
ED: * Loving can hurt

39:02.774 --> 39:05.811
* Loving can hurt sometimes

39:05.844 --> 39:08.547
BUCK: There are a lot of ways
to be lost at sea.

39:08.580 --> 39:11.650
ED: * Only thing that I know

39:11.683 --> 39:13.351
BUCK:
It's not the same as being

39:13.385 --> 39:14.986
abandoned or stranded.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.989
Those things happen
beyond our control.

39:18.023 --> 39:22.828
ED: * Hard, you know it can
get hard sometimes *

39:22.861 --> 39:24.663
BUCK: Sometimes,
we just take a wrong turn

39:24.696 --> 39:25.864
too close to the tide.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.833
ED: * It is the only thing

39:27.866 --> 39:30.068
BUCK: The waters rise
and sweep us away.

39:30.101 --> 39:31.903
ED: * Alive

39:31.937 --> 39:33.405
*

39:33.439 --> 39:36.374
BUCK: We fight the currents
for a way back

39:36.408 --> 39:39.177
to dry land and solid ground,

39:39.210 --> 39:40.412
to each other...

39:40.446 --> 39:43.882
May, sweetheart.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.417
BUCK: To normal.

39:45.451 --> 39:47.919
Come on, baby, join us.

39:47.953 --> 39:50.088
BUCK: And when we catch
our breaths,

39:50.121 --> 39:53.024
we search the shore
for all the we lost

39:53.058 --> 39:56.562
and everything we loved,
for our families...

39:56.595 --> 40:00.599
ED: * Holding me closer
till our eyes meet *

40:00.632 --> 40:01.967
I do.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.635
ED: * You won't ever be
alone *

40:03.669 --> 40:06.304
BUCK: For our dreams
and our futures...

40:06.337 --> 40:08.707
ED: * Wait for me
to come home *

40:08.740 --> 40:11.877
BUCK:
Our friends and loved ones...

40:11.910 --> 40:13.945
*

40:13.979 --> 40:17.215
ED: * Loving can mend
your soul *

40:17.248 --> 40:19.217
BUCK: And for the ones
who couldn't swim.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.886
ED:
* And it's the only thing

40:20.919 --> 40:22.721
You know, there could have been
a lot more faces on that wall

40:22.754 --> 40:24.389
if it weren't for you.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.892
*

40:26.925 --> 40:28.126
ED: * I swear it will get

40:28.159 --> 40:31.563
Thanks for being here.

40:31.597 --> 40:34.232
ED: * That with every piece
of ya *

40:34.265 --> 40:37.936
I'm Big Sister.
It's what I do.

40:37.969 --> 40:39.404
ED: * Only thing we take

40:39.437 --> 40:42.340
-Come here.
-ED: * With us when we die

40:42.373 --> 40:45.143
*

40:45.176 --> 40:47.913
* When I'm away

40:47.946 --> 40:50.916
* I will remember
how you kissed *

40:50.949 --> 40:53.485
BUCK: Sometimes,
being lost is not knowing

40:53.519 --> 40:55.754
how to get
from where we are

40:55.787 --> 40:58.490
to where we wanna be,

40:58.524 --> 41:00.759
where we need to be.

41:00.792 --> 41:03.929
ED: * Wait for me
to come home *

41:03.962 --> 41:05.797
(knock at door)

41:08.900 --> 41:10.368
Hey, Buck.

41:10.401 --> 41:11.770
Good morning, Buck.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.772
Hey--hey, buddy.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.206
Okay.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.843
There's a morning snack
and midday snack,

41:17.876 --> 41:19.978
two coloring books
and a bunch of Legos.

41:20.011 --> 41:22.113
Between us,
he's never built anything

41:22.147 --> 41:23.281
that kinda looks like anything.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.616
He just likes
sticking things together.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.117
It's right there, buddy.

41:26.151 --> 41:29.955
There's 20 bucks for pizza,
and if I were you,

41:29.988 --> 41:31.790
I'd eat a couple extra slices.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.124
You look like
you're wasting away to nothing.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.560
-Eddie--
-EDDIE: I will say, honestly,

41:34.593 --> 41:36.795
you being laid up
is working out for me.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.463
I mean, you're no abuela,
and you're half a Carla,

41:38.496 --> 41:39.898
but you'll do in a pinch.

41:39.931 --> 41:43.134
You want me to watch
Christopher?

41:43.168 --> 41:45.236
It's easy.
He's not very fast.

41:45.270 --> 41:46.471
After everything that happened?

41:46.504 --> 41:48.640
A natural disaster happened,
Buck.

41:48.674 --> 41:51.476
-I lost him, Eddie.
-EDDIE: No, You saved him.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.311
That's how he remembers it.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.146
(tender music)

41:55.180 --> 41:58.083
And now, it's his turn
to do the same for you.

41:58.116 --> 42:01.720
*

42:01.753 --> 42:03.822
I was supposed to look out
for him.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.657
And what, you think you failed?

42:05.691 --> 42:08.159
I failed that kid more times
than I care to count,

42:08.193 --> 42:09.661
and I'm his father.

42:09.695 --> 42:12.931
But I love him enough
to never stop trying,

42:12.964 --> 42:15.701
and I know you do too.

42:15.734 --> 42:20.271
Buck...there's nobody
in this world

42:20.305 --> 42:23.108
I trust with my son
more than you.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.477
Okay, buddy.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.348
(sighs)
I gotta go.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.183
-CHRISTOPHER: Ooh.
-(Eddie smooches)

42:32.217 --> 42:35.353
Love ya, have fun.

42:35.386 --> 42:38.356
Maybe try going to the zoo
this time, something inland.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.892
(chuckles softly)

42:40.926 --> 42:43.561
Oh, um...

42:43.595 --> 42:47.899
thank you for not giving up.

42:49.334 --> 42:50.969
(door closes)

42:51.002 --> 42:53.538
*

42:53.571 --> 42:55.974
BUCK: A few choice words
can sometimes be

42:56.007 --> 42:58.043
the life raft
that gets you home.

42:58.076 --> 43:01.980
To be seen...

43:02.013 --> 43:04.716
to be found...

43:04.750 --> 43:08.319
isn't that what we're all
searching for?

43:08.353 --> 43:11.322
Hey, Chris.

43:11.356 --> 43:13.558
Oh.

43:13.591 --> 43:15.260
(laughs)

43:15.293 --> 43:17.996
*

44:00.238 --> 44:01.807
ANNOUNCER: Don't miss
a minute of 9-1-1.

44:01.840 --> 44:04.409
