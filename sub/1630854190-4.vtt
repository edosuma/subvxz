WEBVTT

00:09.576 --> 00:11.244
TODD:
Bus pass right here...

00:11.311 --> 00:13.513
Okay. Okay.
Just pull it.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.615
What-- Mom!
Hold on. Sorry.
(screams)

00:15.682 --> 00:17.517
Can you help me, please, Todd?
TODD: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:17.584 --> 00:19.386
I got it. Ow.
Up there.

00:20.019 --> 00:22.789
I never should've asked you
for a ride to work this morning.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.791
Well, who could've known that
my car would break down again?

00:24.858 --> 00:28.395
You, Todd. You!

00:28.461 --> 00:31.531
How long had your
check engine light been on?

00:31.598 --> 00:33.466
I don't know, like,
seven or eight months.

00:35.335 --> 00:37.237
TODD:
I'm just saying,

00:37.303 --> 00:38.671
engine lights
are a suggestion.

00:38.738 --> 00:39.806
It's something you can do
every few hundred miles,

00:39.873 --> 00:42.308
or if you have the time,
or money.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.777
I failed you
as a parent.

00:43.843 --> 00:45.378
Anyway,
what's the big deal?

00:45.445 --> 00:47.213
A.A. towed the car for free,
so it's no problem.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.249
A.A.? Oh, well,
Alcoholics Anonymous

00:49.315 --> 00:52.819
might tow your car for free, but
Triple A is a paid membership.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.522
Just like I pay to have my car
serviced regularly

00:55.588 --> 00:56.790
because that
is what adults do.

00:56.856 --> 00:58.491
They take responsibility
for their lives.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.193
Sure. Right. Responsibility.
Sounds expensive.

01:00.260 --> 01:01.728
Oh, what is more expensive
is waiting for things

01:01.795 --> 01:04.464
to fall apart, and I'm the one
paying for it today,

01:04.531 --> 01:06.065
and not to mention,
my car is in the shop

01:06.132 --> 01:07.600
because you backed it
into a wall.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.569
Okay, that wall was not there,
and then it was.

01:09.636 --> 01:11.204
Oh, Todd, you are going
to the hospital

01:11.271 --> 01:12.572
to borrow your sister's car...
(elevator bell dings)

01:12.639 --> 01:14.340
...because I have court
this afternoon,

01:14.407 --> 01:17.343
and I am not going through this
again in the rain on the bus.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.711
Oh, you don't like

01:18.778 --> 01:21.147
taking the bus? Really?
No, Todd. Go.

01:21.214 --> 01:23.316
Goodbye.
What?

01:23.383 --> 01:25.285
Hi, Allison.

01:25.351 --> 01:26.553
Hi, Mom.
Uh, listen,

01:26.619 --> 01:28.488
Todd is on his way
over to borrow your car.

01:28.555 --> 01:30.557
Hi, Sarah, can you please
give this to Allister

01:30.623 --> 01:31.758
and straighten it out
for God's sake.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.359
Thank you.
ALLISON: Todd has a car.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.796
Your old car, and I don't
want him "Toddifying" mine.

01:36.863 --> 01:38.465
Yeah, well, my current car
is in the shop

01:38.531 --> 01:39.632
because Todd
backed it into a wall.

01:39.699 --> 01:41.100
This is not helping your case.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.502
Allison, you are not lending
the car to Todd.

01:42.569 --> 01:44.537
You are lending it to me.
Good morning.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.473
Morning.
And I'm gonna be
the one driving it,

01:46.539 --> 01:49.209
and I will return it
to you safely, I promise.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.177
I've got to go. Sorry. Bye.

01:51.244 --> 01:52.745
What a mess.
Good morning, Francey.

01:52.812 --> 01:54.514
Sean Phillips is waiting
in your office

01:54.581 --> 01:56.416
to go over his testimony
for the trial.

01:56.483 --> 01:58.051
(stammers)

01:58.117 --> 01:59.652
Northbrook has a nice write-up
in The Sentinel.

01:59.719 --> 02:02.088
A piece about how
the boy genius

02:02.155 --> 02:05.158
is expanding them beyond private
jets into commercial planes.

02:05.225 --> 02:07.026
Media hound.
Any mention

02:07.093 --> 02:09.662
of the crash or the six
injured people or our client?

02:09.729 --> 02:11.331
No. No mention.
Of course not.

02:11.397 --> 02:12.665
Oh.
Wait, wait, wait.

02:12.732 --> 02:15.101
What? Okay.
Okay. Good, good.

02:19.205 --> 02:20.507
Okay, Sean,

02:20.573 --> 02:22.609
I have got one more
practice question for you.

02:22.675 --> 02:26.179
Um, how has
the accident,

02:26.246 --> 02:27.614
the injury
affected your life?

02:27.680 --> 02:31.417
Well, when I lost my leg,
it took nine weeks to heal.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.520
Mm-hmm.
But I never let up
on the PT.

02:33.586 --> 02:35.755
Just like today,
I came right after practice.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.757
I've been training
for months now

02:37.824 --> 02:39.759
so I can get back in shape
and compete

02:39.826 --> 02:41.528
in the 2024
Paralympics.

02:41.594 --> 02:44.430
Okay, okay, okay,
Sean, um...

02:44.497 --> 02:46.599
I'm gonna have to
interrupt you for a minute.

02:48.434 --> 02:50.303
You have a very
positive mindset.

02:50.370 --> 02:53.039
Won me two gold medals
in Tokyo.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.642
And all of Portland
admires you for that,

02:55.708 --> 02:58.678
but the plane crash
changed everything.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.613
A-A-And
your injury...

03:00.680 --> 03:02.315
I don't like
to dwell on that.

03:02.382 --> 03:06.019
But the other passengers,
they got very small settlements.

03:06.085 --> 03:08.655
Yeah, for a sprained ankle,
a broken arm.

03:08.721 --> 03:10.590
Nobody was hurt
as bad as me.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.992
And the jury needs
to understand that.

03:13.059 --> 03:15.395
(sighs)

03:16.829 --> 03:19.065
My leg was crushed

03:19.132 --> 03:22.602
between two
plane seats.

03:22.669 --> 03:26.406
I was trapped there
for... hours,

03:26.472 --> 03:29.075
and the doctors,
they tried to...

03:29.142 --> 03:32.178
save my leg,
but, uh...

03:32.245 --> 03:34.047
a decision
had to be made.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.250
That was
a horrible day.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.118
But then...

03:39.185 --> 03:40.286
What happened?

03:40.353 --> 03:42.622
The bills.

03:42.689 --> 03:45.558
Hospitals,
anesthesia, prosthetics.

03:45.625 --> 03:48.595
They just kept coming and...

03:49.862 --> 03:53.499
My own mom had to take out
a second mortgage

03:53.566 --> 03:56.169
to help me pay my bills. My mom.

03:57.036 --> 04:00.039
I'm a grown man. I should
be able to provide for myself,

04:00.106 --> 04:02.075
and Northbrook
took that from me.

04:02.141 --> 04:05.678
That was their mistake, their
plane, and they should pay up.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.647
(door opens)

04:07.714 --> 04:09.749
Mar, we were just served
with notice.

04:09.816 --> 04:12.452
Northbrook is filing a motion.
They want to dismiss the case.

04:12.518 --> 04:13.753
Hearing in two hours.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.589
(scoffs) Of course
they'd pull that now.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.158
What's going on?
It's a ploy

04:19.225 --> 04:20.727
these huge corporations use.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.662
They file motions
to dismiss cases.

04:22.729 --> 04:25.465
No, but it hasn't even started.

04:25.531 --> 04:27.333
They're trying to scare us,

04:27.400 --> 04:30.169
but we don't scare.

04:31.704 --> 04:34.474
Chuck just
detailed my car,

04:34.540 --> 04:36.709
so please
don't mess it up.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.411
You don't trust me
with your things?

04:38.478 --> 04:40.179
You set our microwave
on fire.

04:40.246 --> 04:42.415
Hey, metal staples fastening
tea bags to strings

04:42.482 --> 04:44.150
is a terrible idea.
I stand by that.

04:44.217 --> 04:47.520
Look, whatever. I'm not
borrowing your car. Mom is.

04:47.587 --> 04:49.756
Okay, then tell Mom
to pick me up at 5:00,

04:49.822 --> 04:52.125
sharp.

04:52.191 --> 04:54.227
I'm an idiot.

04:57.430 --> 04:59.465
Good morning. Hi.
Sorry we're late.

04:59.532 --> 05:02.735
Uh, Sean, uh,
this is my son, Todd.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.704
Uh, you both
went to Wilson.

05:04.771 --> 05:06.406
Wow. Hi. Yeah, I saw you break

05:06.472 --> 05:07.707
the Wilson High record
in the javelin.

05:07.774 --> 05:10.043
I legit cried.
Oh, good to meet you, man.

05:10.109 --> 05:12.445
Did you have, uh,
Mr. Parks for physics?

05:12.512 --> 05:13.746
Uh, thought we were all
living in the Matrix,

05:13.813 --> 05:15.314
had hair everywhere
other than his own head?

05:15.381 --> 05:17.083
Yes, I do remember. (laughs)
(laughs)

05:17.150 --> 05:18.484
Hey, Sean,
can I get your autograph?

05:18.551 --> 05:21.054
Oh, yeah, man,
of course.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.555
Wait, is that him?

05:22.622 --> 05:24.290
MARGARET:
Gus Easton.

05:24.357 --> 05:27.527
SUSAN:
How is he the "master of
corporate law" in that suit?

05:27.593 --> 05:30.663
He is from Seattle.

05:32.131 --> 05:33.299
Attorney Wright.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.668
Attorney Easton.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.675
He's the worthy
opponent who guided

05:42.742 --> 05:45.478
that jerk aerospace CEO
to success?

05:45.545 --> 05:46.746
That dude's confident
he's gonna win.

05:46.813 --> 05:48.381
I know that look.
I've had it.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.016
Come on,
you're Sean Phillips.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.551
There's no way
we're gonna lose this.

05:51.617 --> 05:54.387
As long as we don't get
Judge Sauceda.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.589
BAILIFF: All rise.
Honorable Judge Sauceda.

06:03.262 --> 06:06.566
SAUCEDA:
Sean Phillips v.
Northbrook Aerospace.

06:06.632 --> 06:10.036
We're here on defendant's
summary judgment motion.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.237
Go ahead, counsel.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.972
Thank you, Your Honor.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.441
I'd like to present
the court with, uh...

06:15.508 --> 06:18.177
Oh, come on,
where is it? Well...

06:18.244 --> 06:20.179
Hold your horses. Here, here.

06:20.246 --> 06:21.380
Here it is.

06:21.447 --> 06:24.517
This joint report
from the FAA and NTSB

06:24.584 --> 06:25.752
that we just received.

06:25.818 --> 06:27.453
Uh, Your Honor,
I was not served,

06:27.520 --> 06:29.055
and I need time
to review this report.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.290
Let's just see
where this is going.

06:31.357 --> 06:32.725
GUS:
Their investigation concluded

06:32.792 --> 06:35.995
that Flight 254's accident
was an uncontrollable event.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.197
Black ice,
landing strip,

06:38.264 --> 06:39.532
an act of God, so

06:39.599 --> 06:41.501
we respectfully request
a dismissal,

06:41.567 --> 06:43.603
as this report confirms that
Northbrook is not at fault.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.138
Uh, Your Honor,
our pilot witness

06:45.204 --> 06:47.607
will testify that he flew
the plane without error.

06:47.673 --> 06:49.242
Therefore, a malfunction
had to have occurred.

06:49.308 --> 06:52.411
Yes, I've read your compelling
witness declaration,

06:52.478 --> 06:53.780
but in light of this report,

06:53.846 --> 06:56.649
I'm inclined to grant
the motion and dismiss.

06:56.716 --> 06:59.252
Your Honor,
our hometown hero

06:59.318 --> 07:01.954
and decorated Olympian
now has a prosthetic limb

07:02.021 --> 07:03.689
and over half a million dollars
in medical debt.

07:03.756 --> 07:07.026
Objection. Irrelevant.
This is a government
agency report.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.695
It is not binding on the court,
and over a quarter of them

07:09.762 --> 07:11.464
are wrong anyway,
and... Wait.

07:11.531 --> 07:14.300
Just last week, the EPA
reversed its findings

07:14.367 --> 07:16.269
in the
Foregrave matter.

07:16.335 --> 07:18.104
You have my attention.

07:18.171 --> 07:22.175
I need adequate time
to review the report.

07:22.241 --> 07:24.076
I'm asking
for one week.

07:25.478 --> 07:28.181
I'll grant you
a 48-hour continuance.

07:28.247 --> 07:30.016
(gavel bangs)

07:31.384 --> 07:34.320
48 hours isn't
enough time, is it?

07:34.387 --> 07:35.721
Is it?
Sean,

07:35.788 --> 07:37.190
don't worry,

07:37.256 --> 07:38.724
I am going to make
Northbrook pay

07:38.791 --> 07:41.561
for what they did to you.
I promise.

07:43.162 --> 07:45.198
♪ ♪

07:54.106 --> 07:56.175
Attorney Easton.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.443
Attorney Wright.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.579
You cannot go around
filing an ex parte

07:59.645 --> 08:02.248
for a nonemergency.
It is frivolous.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.084
Frivolous? Well,
we wouldn't want that.

08:05.151 --> 08:08.221
But, you know, waiting till
trial would've harmed my client,

08:08.287 --> 08:11.023
and that's an emergency
to me, so...

08:11.090 --> 08:13.726
(scoffs) Aren't there
vending machines on this floor?

08:13.793 --> 08:17.230
I would never pull
a surprise attack like that.

08:17.296 --> 08:18.631
It is disrespectful
and...

08:18.698 --> 08:20.533
I wasn't aware
I was pulling anything.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.969
Wait, aren't you supposed to be
some Portland...

08:23.035 --> 08:24.170
powerhouse attorney?

08:24.237 --> 08:26.973
Getting all twisted up
about an ex parte.

08:27.039 --> 08:30.343
Was I on a different floor when
I saw those vending machines?

08:30.409 --> 08:32.378
I need some chips
or something.

08:32.445 --> 08:35.615
You and I both know that
my client deserves every penny

08:35.681 --> 08:38.351
we can wring out of
Northbrook's greedy clutches.

08:38.417 --> 08:41.387
Yes, we do both
know that,

08:41.454 --> 08:43.356
but you have to do
the wringing.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.158
And I don't
have to help you.

08:46.225 --> 08:51.130
I want those boxes of discovery
in my office by noon today.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.032
Mm. I'll see
what I can do.

08:53.099 --> 08:55.368
I just have a hard time
keeping track of my briefs.

08:55.434 --> 08:58.004
Well... please
keep track of them,

08:58.070 --> 09:00.239
from now on. I would.

09:00.306 --> 09:02.608
You would keep track
of my briefs?

09:02.675 --> 09:04.543
(shuddering sigh)

09:09.415 --> 09:12.518
Honestly, he's wearing
corduroy pants.

09:12.585 --> 09:15.454
Opposing counsel,
in court, in corduroy.

09:15.521 --> 09:17.223
I mean, where do you
even buy corduroy?

09:17.290 --> 09:18.624
Uh, corduroy store?

09:18.691 --> 09:21.961
No one should wear corduroy,
except Princess Diana,

09:22.028 --> 09:23.362
and only that once.

09:23.429 --> 09:25.398
Okay, and why do we care
about this guy's pants again?

09:25.464 --> 09:27.166
Because he's infuriating.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.069
He is a hustler, he's a shyster,

09:30.136 --> 09:32.305
and he is from Seattle.

09:32.371 --> 09:34.273
He's trying to pull one
over on me,

09:34.340 --> 09:36.242
but I know exactly
what he's going to do.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.444
He's going to try
to bury us in paperwork

09:38.511 --> 09:41.480
to waste what precious
little time we have.

09:41.547 --> 09:43.983
It's just like that
Mark Buffalo movie Open Waters.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.185
Uh, pretty sure
Open Water's a shark movie,

09:46.252 --> 09:49.422
but Mark Ruffalo was in a movie
called Dark Waters.

09:49.488 --> 09:50.456
No.

09:50.523 --> 09:53.459
Mark "Rah-fallo" is in a movie
with Anne Hathburne

09:53.526 --> 09:56.095
that you made me watch,
and he played a lawyer.

09:56.162 --> 09:57.697
Yeah, in corduroy pants.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.265
Dark Waters.
No.

09:59.332 --> 10:02.134
Todd, we got
48 hours

10:02.201 --> 10:04.403
to find a needle
in a mound of paperwork,

10:04.470 --> 10:06.739
so let's-- Wait,
why are you driving?

10:06.806 --> 10:08.007
What?
No, Todd.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.775
No. A-Allison wants me...

10:14.347 --> 10:15.581
This can't be all of it.

10:15.648 --> 10:17.416
I triple-checked
with the mail room.

10:17.483 --> 10:19.552
Wh-What about those?

10:19.618 --> 10:21.520
Unrelated.
I'm an associate,

10:21.587 --> 10:23.689
so my office
is part storage room.

10:23.756 --> 10:24.790
Hmm.
(toilet flushes)

10:24.857 --> 10:26.258
MARGARET:
What was that?

10:26.325 --> 10:28.527
Uh, my office
is part storage room

10:28.594 --> 10:30.296
and right next
to the, uh...

10:30.363 --> 10:32.031
(man whistles, grunts)

10:32.098 --> 10:34.033
My God, you can
hear everything.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.401
I am so sorry, Susan.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.570
When I was an associate lawyer,

10:37.636 --> 10:39.538
my office was basically
in the kitchen.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.140
Bet you had a chair,
though, huh?

10:41.207 --> 10:46.312
Okay. Let's see what this
Gus the shark has sent us.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.447
Uh, let's see,
weather maps

10:48.514 --> 10:50.182
and graphs for the day
of the accident.

10:50.249 --> 10:53.185
That's to establish cold weather
for their "act of God" theory.

10:53.252 --> 10:56.155
Peer-reviewed scientific paper
on the hazards of black ice.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.257
And a mechanic's report

10:58.324 --> 11:00.593
signed by a "Konner Preston."

11:00.659 --> 11:02.728
Wait, what's going on
with his name?

11:02.795 --> 11:05.064
There's bits of ink
behind the letters. Look.

11:05.131 --> 11:06.298
And look.

11:06.365 --> 11:08.100
The line below,
there's some pieces missing,

11:08.167 --> 11:09.568
like something
was whited out.

11:09.635 --> 11:11.203
MARGARET:
And then another name
was written over the top.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.005
There was another...
Mechanic.

11:13.072 --> 11:15.141
Okay.

11:15.207 --> 11:17.276
Todd, Susan and I
are going to scour

11:17.343 --> 11:18.677
the rest of this
paltry paperwork.

11:18.744 --> 11:20.546
You go and track down
Konner Preston.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.548
"Track down" like interview,
or "track down" kidnap and kill?

11:22.615 --> 11:25.184
(laughs)
Don't encourage him.

11:25.251 --> 11:26.585
You're going to go find

11:26.652 --> 11:28.421
this person
and find out what name

11:28.487 --> 11:31.424
is missing from this form.
Go. Find out.

11:32.458 --> 11:33.726
He's not funny.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.494
He's a little funny.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.634
Oh.

11:55.314 --> 11:57.249
Konner Preston?

11:58.217 --> 12:00.052
That's right.
Sorry, you are?

12:00.119 --> 12:02.188
Rich Riddington, FAA.

12:02.254 --> 12:03.622
Just had a few questions about

12:03.689 --> 12:05.758
some report you
filled out regarding

12:05.825 --> 12:07.660
Northbrook
model 22-75.

12:07.726 --> 12:09.528
Yeah, that's me.
Is there a problem with my work?

12:09.595 --> 12:12.364
No, no, no, confidential
FAA form, ghost protocol.

12:12.431 --> 12:14.200
No, not a problem,
per se,

12:14.266 --> 12:15.768
but, uh, typically,

12:15.835 --> 12:18.137
we ask for the original
of a report,

12:18.204 --> 12:20.506
and it looks like
this is a copy.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.542
Yeah. Uh, I was told
by my boss...

12:23.609 --> 12:26.278
Thing is, it sort of looks like
there was a different signature

12:26.345 --> 12:28.414
here underneath,
and it was whited out.

12:28.481 --> 12:31.016
Know anything
about that?

12:32.184 --> 12:33.452
That's above my pay grade.

12:33.519 --> 12:37.423
Eh, see, this is your signature,

12:37.490 --> 12:40.326
so it's exactly your pay grade.

12:40.392 --> 12:43.028
Who was the
first mechanic?

12:46.699 --> 12:47.600
Tyesha Johnson?

12:47.666 --> 12:50.035
I need to speak
to her.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.337
She, uh...

12:51.403 --> 12:52.538
She doesn't
work here anymore.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.374
She's dead?
No! No.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.076
Look, I'm not supposed
to say anything.

12:57.143 --> 12:59.411
About murdering her?
No!

12:59.478 --> 13:01.147
She's not dead.
She's working

13:01.213 --> 13:02.982
at some shop
in Hillsboro.

13:03.048 --> 13:04.383
Shop in Hillsboro...

13:04.450 --> 13:07.720
I-I don't know.
Just-just leave me alone.

13:11.157 --> 13:12.725
Excellent work, everybody.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.264
MARGARET:
And where and when

13:18.330 --> 13:21.467
did you valet park
Allison's car for $25?

13:21.534 --> 13:23.536
Outside your office.
I obviously couldn't get into

13:23.602 --> 13:25.404
the garage, and I didn't
have money for a meter,

13:25.471 --> 13:27.106
and I didn't want
to get another ticket.

13:27.173 --> 13:28.307
Another ticket?

13:28.374 --> 13:29.308
Whatever.
Those red light traffic cams

13:29.375 --> 13:30.576
are unconstitutional.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.244
And it won't be Allison
in the photo.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.679
It'll be me,
so she can contest it.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.481
And you could help her.
You're a lawyer.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.583
Marvelous.
Okay, so what makes you think

13:37.650 --> 13:39.552
that this Tyesha Johnson
works here?

13:39.618 --> 13:41.420
TODD:
Well, I can't give away
patented trade secrets,

13:41.487 --> 13:43.155
but cold calling
the only two

13:43.222 --> 13:45.624
non-Northbrook airplane
repair shops in Hillsboro

13:45.691 --> 13:47.359
did yield
quick results.
(chuckles)

13:47.426 --> 13:50.062
All right. Let's go in,
but I remind you

13:50.129 --> 13:51.530
that we are running
out of time,

13:51.597 --> 13:53.165
so I will handle
the talking.

13:53.232 --> 13:56.302
Oh, right, right, I was born
to just listen and smile.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.604
Not one word.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.573
BOTH:
Tyesha Johnson?

14:01.740 --> 14:03.409
I don't know you.

14:03.475 --> 14:06.345
I'm Margaret Wright.
I work for Sean Phillips,

14:06.412 --> 14:09.415
the athlete
that was injured...
You have to go. Now.

14:09.481 --> 14:12.384
We're trying to hold Northbrook
accountable for the...

14:12.451 --> 14:15.287
Are you? Or are you
from Northbrook,

14:15.354 --> 14:16.589
trying to shake me down

14:16.655 --> 14:18.657
because Sean Phillips
is suing your ass?

14:18.724 --> 14:19.625
As I said,

14:19.692 --> 14:21.994
I am Sean Phillips' attorney,
Margaret Wright.

14:22.061 --> 14:23.462
We want to hold
Northbrook accountable

14:23.529 --> 14:25.231
for the accident and
get damages for Sean.

14:25.297 --> 14:27.199
TODD:
And you can help us.

14:28.133 --> 14:31.136
We think that you examined
the plane after it crashed

14:31.203 --> 14:33.472
and they're burying
your report.

14:35.341 --> 14:36.742
What did they say
caused the crash?

14:36.809 --> 14:38.477
Black ice.

14:40.112 --> 14:42.248
It isn't the ice?

14:43.782 --> 14:45.351
It's the cold.

14:46.485 --> 14:49.488
When the temperature falls below
freezing, the actuator fails,

14:49.555 --> 14:51.290
and the arm
won't deploy

14:51.357 --> 14:53.259
during landing. It'll crash.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.160
And that was in
your report.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.697
Yes, but also,
I told them several times

14:58.764 --> 15:00.466
before the accident,

15:00.532 --> 15:04.370
but they ignored me every time.

15:11.343 --> 15:13.212
I-I can't talk here.
It's not safe.

15:13.279 --> 15:14.980
You have to go.
Is that guy watching you?

15:15.047 --> 15:16.015
Please just go.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.516
Tyesha, wait, wait.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.184
If they didn't listen
to you, I'm sorry,

15:19.251 --> 15:22.721
but if they are trying to harass
you into silence, we can help.

15:22.788 --> 15:26.458
Whistleblowers are
protected by the law.

15:26.525 --> 15:29.528
But if no one comes forward
to testify, there will be

15:29.595 --> 15:32.364
more accidents
and more victims.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.370
You should go.

15:44.343 --> 15:46.245
Hey, Mom, uh,
take a selfie with me.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.414
The two of us. Come on.
Okay.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.150
Come on.
Higher. There.

15:53.185 --> 15:55.120
(phone camera clicks)

15:55.187 --> 15:56.255
Okay.
Let me see.

15:56.322 --> 15:57.723
Who is he?

15:57.790 --> 16:00.459
I don't know, but Tyesha's
definitely scared of him.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.995
Would Northbrook
have goons?

16:03.062 --> 16:04.663
No. They're too smart
for that.

16:04.730 --> 16:06.965
They'd hire someone else
to do their dirty work.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.301
LYLE:
Car is registered
to a Nathan Shaw.

16:09.368 --> 16:11.337
Investigator at
Nugent Cross Public Relations.

16:11.403 --> 16:13.605
I knew it, and now
we're dealing with a fixer

16:13.672 --> 16:15.607
from an infamous
and hideous PR firm.

16:15.674 --> 16:17.643
An investigator,
so he's basically me.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.478
Except he's
a licensed professional

16:19.545 --> 16:22.114
with a working vehicle, so
I'd say he skews more toward me.

16:22.181 --> 16:24.249
So unnecessary.
(phone chiming)

16:25.250 --> 16:27.119
"Hi. Uh, this is Tyesha Johnson.

16:27.186 --> 16:29.188
"Come to my house right now.

16:29.254 --> 16:30.689
4660 Westwood Terrace."

16:30.756 --> 16:32.725
Come on.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.228
You're welcome.

16:38.063 --> 16:40.999
4660. That's it.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.135
TODD:
Is that...?

16:43.202 --> 16:44.737
That's him.

16:46.805 --> 16:49.608
(phone camera clicking)

16:52.144 --> 16:53.712
(engine starts, tires squeal)

17:02.020 --> 17:04.022
Tyesha?

17:04.089 --> 17:06.592
Tyesha!
Tyesha!

17:06.658 --> 17:08.660
Tyesha.

17:11.063 --> 17:13.098
She's not here.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.600
She's gone.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.472
If you wait 48 hours, I don't
know what's gonna happen to her.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.508
She could be dead!
Uh, yes, a potential
witness for...

17:22.574 --> 17:24.510
Yes, call the judge. Great.
Yes, I understand. I understand.

17:24.576 --> 17:27.413
No, no, I do not understand!
Thank you, Detective.

17:27.479 --> 17:29.314
When my daughter Tyesha
returns from Madagascar,

17:29.381 --> 17:32.217
I will have her cancel this
card, and you can bank on that.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.720
(phone beeps)
(sighs) Double dead end, huh?

17:34.787 --> 17:36.455
Well, we didn't find anything.

17:36.522 --> 17:41.193
No documents, no emails,
nothing relating to Northbrook.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.694
Yeah, that Nathan guy
cleaned her out.

17:42.761 --> 17:45.397
There's no computers, phones,
hard drives, flash drives.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.499
We are running out of time,
and the only way

17:47.566 --> 17:50.135
we are going to defeat
this motion for Sean

17:50.202 --> 17:52.104
is if she testifies.

17:53.272 --> 17:55.274
What? What are you
staring at?

17:55.340 --> 17:58.544
She did the entire
Sunday crossword.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.679
That's very challenging.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.148
This guy looks like
her boyfriend.

18:03.215 --> 18:04.583
Maybe he has some idea
where she is.

18:04.650 --> 18:07.619
What is Tyesha's
relationship status on Insta?

18:07.686 --> 18:09.588
Insta? Did you
just say Insta?

18:09.655 --> 18:11.490
I do pay
attention, Todd.

18:11.557 --> 18:14.159
I wasn't born
under some...

18:15.627 --> 18:17.996
(lawn mower whirring)

18:21.633 --> 18:24.703
MARGARET:
Your sister
is going to kill you.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.505
Has it ever occurred to you
that I am actually,

18:26.572 --> 18:28.640
and legally,
an adult?
Meaning?

18:28.707 --> 18:31.009
It means that I have
my own independence.

18:31.076 --> 18:32.744
I choose what time
I go to bed,

18:32.811 --> 18:34.313
if I go to bed
at night.

18:34.379 --> 18:37.182
I can eat as much cereal
and candy as I want, and I do,

18:37.249 --> 18:40.385
and I'm a P.I., sort of,
and I'm doing just fine.

18:40.452 --> 18:43.155
I'm merely saying
that the rest of us manage...
No, the rest of you

18:43.222 --> 18:44.590
spend a little bit
too much time worrying

18:44.656 --> 18:46.191
about what I'm doing,
to be honest.

18:46.258 --> 18:47.626
But if you take responsibility
for someone's car,

18:47.693 --> 18:49.328
then you have to...
Things happen.

18:49.394 --> 18:51.563
Like with Tyesha.
Is it her responsibility

18:51.630 --> 18:53.332
that some goon
is following her?

18:53.398 --> 18:55.634
Yes, technically, yes.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.336
She was whistleblowing
on Northbrook,

18:57.402 --> 18:59.037
but, philosophically, no.

18:59.104 --> 19:00.405
She was trying
to keep people safe.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.674
This is apples to oranges.

19:02.741 --> 19:05.277
It has zero to do with fruit.

19:05.344 --> 19:08.680
I don't think this Nathan guy
knows where Tyesha is, either.

19:08.747 --> 19:10.015
MARGARET:
Why not?

19:10.082 --> 19:12.150
Because there he is,
right there,

19:12.217 --> 19:14.019
outside Tyesha's
boyfriend's house.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.687
MARGARET:
How do you think he found him?

19:15.754 --> 19:17.623
TODD:
Instagram and the white pages,
just like we did.

19:17.689 --> 19:19.591
He's one step
ahead of us.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.493
What are we
going to do?

19:21.560 --> 19:23.428
Has he seen us?

19:23.495 --> 19:25.230
What if he's
dangerous?

19:25.297 --> 19:27.299
We're gonna beat this idiot
at his own game.

19:27.366 --> 19:29.635
Do you have any duct tape
in your purse?

19:33.038 --> 19:35.274
Okay, all right,
bandages.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.043
This will do. Now, I need you
to distract that idiot

19:38.110 --> 19:41.179
in the sedan while I attach
this tNAB tracker

19:41.246 --> 19:43.215
to the back of his car.
Distract him?

19:43.282 --> 19:45.384
Yeah.
Why? What are we doing?

19:45.450 --> 19:46.752
Wait, what if he's a maniac?

19:46.818 --> 19:48.320
What-what if
he has a Taser?

19:48.387 --> 19:50.255
Are you seriously,
you're asking me to just

19:50.322 --> 19:52.591
go over there and just
chit-chat about what?

19:52.658 --> 19:55.294
I mean, what am I gonna talk
to him about? I don't know him.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.728
(muffled talking)

20:04.503 --> 20:07.472
I'm-- Well, you know
who I am, don't you?

20:07.539 --> 20:10.042
And I know who you are.
You're Nathan Shaw.

20:10.108 --> 20:11.443
But the question is...

20:11.510 --> 20:13.478
NATHAN:
What do you want?

20:13.545 --> 20:16.748
TODD: Uh, just... you know...
Come on. (grunts)

20:16.815 --> 20:20.319
Spy to spy,
how much you getting paid?

20:20.385 --> 20:21.553
Buzz off, punk.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.588
(grunts)

20:22.654 --> 20:24.189
Oh.

20:24.256 --> 20:28.093
(coughs) Um, I'm just,
I'm just thinking, you know,

20:28.160 --> 20:29.761
maybe I could pick up
a shift or two

20:29.828 --> 20:31.363
here and there,
you know what I mean?

20:31.430 --> 20:34.099
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.300
I'm just thinking

20:35.367 --> 20:38.303
maybe I should work
for your PR firm.

20:38.370 --> 20:39.638
Right? Me? Right?

20:39.705 --> 20:42.140
Todd Wright.
You work for your mom.

20:42.207 --> 20:44.343
TODD:
I know, but I'm not
getting any benefits.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.444
And she is terrible.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.279
I mean, she can't even put
a bandage on a situation.

20:47.346 --> 20:49.047
NATHAN:
If I see you anywhere near

20:49.114 --> 20:50.782
our business again,
this is gonna escalate in ways

20:50.849 --> 20:53.518
you're not gonna like. Got it?
Got it.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.120
(engine starts)
(stammers) Don't-don't-don't...

20:55.187 --> 20:56.388
Hold on, no, wait,
what's your sign?

20:56.455 --> 20:58.724
Please, do not go.
No, wait, wait!

20:58.790 --> 21:00.125
Wait, wait!

21:04.162 --> 21:07.733
I did it. (chuckles)
(sighs)

21:07.799 --> 21:10.068
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Mobley.

21:10.135 --> 21:11.770
We-we do have
a few questions.

21:11.837 --> 21:13.572
Listen, I don't know
Sean Phillips,

21:13.639 --> 21:15.207
and I don't know you,

21:15.273 --> 21:17.142
so I can't really help...
Look, Tyesha's missing.

21:17.209 --> 21:20.646
She was being followed,
and her place was ransacked.

21:20.712 --> 21:23.148
She's in trouble,
in real trouble.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.017
Damn.

21:25.083 --> 21:26.718
I was hoping that was
all over for her.

21:26.785 --> 21:30.288
What's all over?
Has she been followed before?

21:31.723 --> 21:33.692
Back when she was working
at Northbrook,

21:33.759 --> 21:36.261
they were flying a bunch of
their new commercial airplanes.

21:36.328 --> 21:38.430
While Tyesha was working
on one of them,

21:38.497 --> 21:39.798
she found a flawed part.

21:39.865 --> 21:42.768
She tried to report it
to her superiors, but...

21:42.834 --> 21:44.536
they didn't want to hear.
So that must have

21:44.603 --> 21:47.305
been the plane that
Sean was flying on.
So they fired her?

21:47.372 --> 21:48.306
No.

21:48.373 --> 21:51.043
They followed her,
harassed her.

21:51.109 --> 21:52.177
All up until she quit.

21:52.244 --> 21:54.079
It's the reason why
we broke up.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.681
I just couldn't take it anymore,

21:55.747 --> 21:58.784
and I just mentally checked out.

21:59.418 --> 22:02.320
Anyways, when I got home
about 30 minutes ago,

22:02.387 --> 22:03.655
this was on my doorstep.

22:03.722 --> 22:06.391
Can I see that?

22:06.458 --> 22:11.363
Wait. It's addressed
to "OKFBHO SGJANC"?

22:11.430 --> 22:14.399
Yeah. That's my name in code.
Tyesha loves that kind of stuff.

22:17.736 --> 22:19.237
MARGARET:
This here--

22:19.304 --> 22:21.440
this is all in code.
And-and you don't know...?

22:21.506 --> 22:24.209
No, I don't know.
Maybe it was for you.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.478
I just know I don't want
any part of this anymore.

22:26.545 --> 22:29.014
Just please leave. Please.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.282
Lyle can probably
crack that code.

22:30.348 --> 22:32.250
Oh, and I can't?
I can crack code.

22:32.317 --> 22:34.619
Well, of course
you can, but...

22:34.686 --> 22:36.621
(birds squawking)

22:36.688 --> 22:38.356
Oh, dear God.

22:38.423 --> 22:40.459
(birds squawking)

22:42.561 --> 22:44.362
LYLE:
Mm. Mm, mm.

22:44.429 --> 22:47.432
Kind of looks like a Vigenère
cipher, but I don't think so.

22:47.499 --> 22:49.501
Yeah, whatever that is,
Einstein. Don't you think

22:49.568 --> 22:51.169
it looks more like
a made-up language,

22:51.236 --> 22:54.072
like Elvish or Klingon
or Wakandan?

22:54.139 --> 22:57.042
A made-up language
like Wakandan?

22:57.109 --> 23:00.145
Yeah.
Are you asking me
if this code is a language

23:00.212 --> 23:02.314
from a fictional country
from the Marvel Universe?

23:02.380 --> 23:04.316
I just thought you'd know
if it was Lord of the Rings

23:04.382 --> 23:07.452
or Star Trek or Marvel
because, you know...

23:07.519 --> 23:09.354
you're a nerd.

23:11.757 --> 23:13.258
What?

23:13.892 --> 23:16.061
Lord of the Rings
is not a comic book.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.063
It is a book book.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.465
And Star Trek is a movie
and TV franchise.

23:20.532 --> 23:22.467
Okay, right, but they both have
made-up languages.

23:22.534 --> 23:24.302
And by the way,
Wakanda's a fictional place,

23:24.369 --> 23:26.471
but there are three real African
languages spoken there:

23:26.538 --> 23:28.406
Xhosa, Yoruba and Hausa.

23:28.473 --> 23:31.042
Only in the comic book do they
have fictional languages,

23:31.109 --> 23:32.711
and this is a billion-dollar...
Wow.

23:32.778 --> 23:34.780
You really are a nerd,
aren't you?

23:34.846 --> 23:36.581
Which Hogwarts
house are you?

23:36.648 --> 23:38.083
You a Slytherin? Oh.

23:38.150 --> 23:39.618
Got any Sith tattoos
I should know about?

23:39.684 --> 23:41.353
Okay, who's the nerd now,
Sheldon?

23:41.419 --> 23:44.456
(phone buzzing)
Oh, my tNAB.

23:44.523 --> 23:46.291
Aha! Looks like the device

23:46.358 --> 23:47.759
my mom attached to
the goon's car is

23:47.826 --> 23:49.494
suspiciously close
to Northbrook HQ.

23:49.561 --> 23:52.364
Okay, I got to go, but you take
a crack at that code, Bones.

23:52.430 --> 23:55.433
You're an investigator,
not a doctor, damn it.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.412
(phone camera clicking)

24:07.479 --> 24:09.981
(phone buzzing)

24:10.048 --> 24:12.417
Mom, I can't talk right now.

24:12.484 --> 24:15.320
Nathan led us straight to Dirk,
the CEO of Northbrook!

24:15.387 --> 24:16.288
They are connected,

24:16.354 --> 24:18.423
and I am getting
photo evidence as we speak.

24:18.490 --> 24:19.991
Did you promise that we would

24:20.058 --> 24:22.327
pick your sister up
from work today?
What?

24:22.394 --> 24:24.196
Did I? No. Maybe.

24:24.262 --> 24:25.697
Did I? I thought
you were supposed to do that.

24:25.764 --> 24:27.232
You never told me that, Todd.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.767
Where are you?
Look, I can't talk right now.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.769
Allison says you promised
we would pick her up

24:30.836 --> 24:32.704
from work today.
She has called you 27 times...

24:32.771 --> 24:34.072
Hi.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.074
Todd! What's happening?

24:36.141 --> 24:38.210
Aah! Oh! Oh!
♪ Baby, baby, bless my soul ♪

24:38.276 --> 24:40.579
Please, please! No, no, no.
♪ I need to fill it ♪

24:40.645 --> 24:43.248
♪ With some rock and roll... ♪

24:43.315 --> 24:45.617
Please. Please, this
is my sister's car.

24:45.684 --> 24:47.319
Please. No!

24:47.385 --> 24:49.087
(groans)

24:49.154 --> 24:51.022
Oh.
(tires squealing)

24:51.089 --> 24:52.324
(engine revving)

24:52.390 --> 24:54.793
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. ♪

25:04.569 --> 25:06.071
(sighs)

25:06.137 --> 25:10.208
Yeah. This is...
how I imagined it going.

25:10.275 --> 25:12.210
Look, it's not as bad
as you think.

25:12.277 --> 25:14.012
I mean, what's
one broken window?

25:14.079 --> 25:15.347
It makes you
look tough.

25:15.413 --> 25:17.482
And there's no bird poop
inside, just... glass.

25:17.549 --> 25:18.750
You're fixing this.

25:18.817 --> 25:20.218
That is right, Todd.
It is your responsibility.

25:20.285 --> 25:22.020
And you...
And you are paying for it

25:22.087 --> 25:24.656
because he has no money,
and I loaned the car to you.

25:24.723 --> 25:27.125
I'm going inside.

25:28.526 --> 25:32.197
Glass shards.
Glass shards in my jacket.
Did you say "grass shards"?

25:32.264 --> 25:34.699
It actually was grass shards
and glass shards.

25:34.766 --> 25:37.102
Allison, what a lovely dinner
you've set for us all tonight.

25:37.168 --> 25:39.337
And the hen is
just a...
Cold.

25:41.573 --> 25:43.441
But really good. Mostly.

25:43.508 --> 25:45.677
Oh, I can just pop it
in the microwave for you...

25:45.744 --> 25:47.445
Chuck, sit down.
Oh.

25:47.512 --> 25:49.748
Todd, apologize
to your sister for the car

25:49.814 --> 25:51.683
and for making us so late.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.319
What? Late because someone
attacked me with a baseball bat?

25:54.386 --> 25:56.588
Attacked you
or attacked the car?

25:56.655 --> 25:58.323
Oh, thank you so much
for your concern, Chet.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.158
Actually, uh, it was a fixer,

26:00.225 --> 26:04.029
an evil fixer who wants me, and
by proxy, Allison's car, dead.

26:04.095 --> 26:05.530
I have photos of him
with Dirk Dobkin.

26:05.597 --> 26:07.599
Dirk Dobkin?
CEO of Northbrook?

26:07.666 --> 26:08.967
We just did a profile on him.

26:09.034 --> 26:10.435
I saw that in this
morning's paper.

26:10.502 --> 26:13.571
You went very easy on him
despite the controversy,

26:13.638 --> 26:15.407
despite the plane crash.
Wait. Can I just

26:15.473 --> 26:17.075
go heat up my food
in the microwave?

26:17.142 --> 26:18.677
Because I'm hungry,
and it's cold.

26:18.743 --> 26:19.978
It's cold?

26:20.645 --> 26:24.349
I waited for you to pick me up
outside in the cold

26:24.416 --> 26:27.485
for an hour and a half,
and that was after working

26:27.552 --> 26:29.621
a ten-hour shift at the ER.

26:29.688 --> 26:31.189
Chuck had
to come down and get me.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.624
And then I had
to rush this dinner,

26:32.691 --> 26:34.092
which I make
on a weekly basis,

26:34.159 --> 26:36.294
for my entire family.

26:36.361 --> 26:38.463
And then you guys were late,
so it gets cold.

26:38.530 --> 26:42.567
And now, I'm reduced to being
this put-upon harpy

26:42.634 --> 26:46.271
who's made furious by the antics
of the idiot in her life.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.373
Well, it's not that cold.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.342
It's charmingly cold.
I can eat it.

26:50.408 --> 26:54.045
Allison. Allison, you're angry,
and you have every right to be.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.613
You feel taken
for granted.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.182
I actually...
I don't want to hear

26:57.248 --> 27:00.118
what I am from you.
Angry is justified?

27:00.185 --> 27:02.120
I'm not interested
in your interpretation of this.

27:02.187 --> 27:05.390
And if you have a problem
with that wine,

27:05.457 --> 27:07.993
oh, my God, I swear...
Oh, no. No,
the wine is fine.

27:08.059 --> 27:09.427
It's lovely.
Yeah. It's very fine wine.

27:09.494 --> 27:13.098
God, I'm so sick of doing this
week in and week out.

27:13.164 --> 27:15.300
Do we have Cornish hens
week in and week out?

27:15.367 --> 27:18.570
I-I think what Allison is trying
to say is that

27:18.636 --> 27:20.038
maybe it would be nice

27:20.105 --> 27:21.639
if someone said
"Thank you" for once.

27:21.706 --> 27:23.174
Oh, thank you.
Allison, thank you.

27:23.241 --> 27:25.176
(overlapping chatter)
No. Thank you.

27:25.243 --> 27:27.746
I don't want "Thank you."
I don't care about "Thank you."

27:27.812 --> 27:30.548
I... Thank you.
Thank you.

27:30.615 --> 27:32.450
Just eat.

27:37.255 --> 27:38.723
Chet?

27:39.891 --> 27:44.396
How many profiles has The
Sentinel done on Dirk Dobkin?

27:44.462 --> 27:46.564
Three in three years?

27:46.631 --> 27:48.299
That seems like a lot.

27:48.366 --> 27:50.035
More than average,
that's for sure.

27:50.101 --> 27:52.303
But Northbrook is always hungry
for good press,

27:52.370 --> 27:55.206
and they're very protective
of their image.
Uh-huh.

27:55.273 --> 27:57.375
How would they feel
about a human interest story

27:57.442 --> 27:59.711
on an Olympic athlete
who got injured in an accident

27:59.778 --> 28:01.479
on one of Northbrook's planes?

28:01.546 --> 28:04.516
An accident they're denying
any responsibility for?

28:04.582 --> 28:06.651
Mm-hmm.
They'd hate it.

28:06.718 --> 28:08.186
Yes.
Oh.

28:11.756 --> 28:14.059
GUS:
Fine.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.294
You go right ahead,
you-you do your press.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.996
Oh, we already have a reporter
very interested

28:18.063 --> 28:19.564
from The Portland Sentinel.

28:19.631 --> 28:21.733
They want
to hear the full story.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.735
You know what? Northbrook denies
any responsibility,

28:23.802 --> 28:26.037
and if you suggest otherwise,

28:26.104 --> 28:29.174
we will sue your firm
and Sean for libel.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.376
Of course you will,
but as you know,

28:31.443 --> 28:33.244
truth is the best defense
against libel.

28:33.311 --> 28:35.613
And Sean and I want
to know the truth

28:35.680 --> 28:37.715
about how accident 254 happened.

28:37.782 --> 28:39.717
About the
faulty actuator,

28:39.784 --> 28:42.387
about what Northbrook
and Dirk Dobkin knew

28:42.454 --> 28:44.189
and when they knew it.

28:44.255 --> 28:48.293
But is that the truth
your side wants to come out?

28:48.960 --> 28:52.564
So perhaps you'd like to settle.

28:52.630 --> 28:55.133
We should meet.

28:55.767 --> 28:58.069
As soon as possible.

28:59.170 --> 29:01.306
(elevator bell dings)

29:10.281 --> 29:12.016
Just go somewhere private
and call her back.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.552
Tell them we're still a go.
This won't change that.

29:14.619 --> 29:16.321
Will do.

29:16.955 --> 29:19.257
Oh. Hey, uh,
where's the restroom?

29:19.324 --> 29:22.093
Oh, it's just, uh, that way,
second door on the left.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.195
Oh.

29:30.768 --> 29:32.203
Sylvia Smith,
of sound mind and body,

29:32.270 --> 29:34.372

29:34.439 --> 29:36.441
Sorry for the interruption.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.643
This is my associate,
Mr. Wright. Can I help you, sir?

29:38.710 --> 29:40.178
Hey, hi. Oh.

29:40.245 --> 29:42.013
Hi. Nice. Sorry.
Uh, listen,

29:42.080 --> 29:43.214
uh, just go about
what you are doing.

29:43.281 --> 29:46.117
We can't do that
because we need privacy.

29:47.185 --> 29:48.219
Mr. Wright,

29:48.286 --> 29:50.121
this is the reading of a will.

29:50.788 --> 29:53.324
And I'm so sorry for your loss.

29:54.826 --> 29:56.294

29:56.361 --> 29:58.997
Well, not if you water it daily.

29:59.063 --> 30:00.999

Dirk wanted me
to give you a call.

30:01.065 --> 30:04.335
Oh, this is so exciting.
What happens in the next room?

30:04.402 --> 30:06.704
(whispering):
Shh. Please. It's the bathroom.

30:06.771 --> 30:09.073
MAN:
No. No, no, don't worry.

30:09.140 --> 30:12.010

so keep production going.

30:14.279 --> 30:16.748
(sighs, whispers):
Now, listen, I think...

30:16.814 --> 30:19.017
(continues indistinctly)

30:19.784 --> 30:22.253
Okay. There you go. You win.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.088
We can settle
right now

30:24.155 --> 30:25.690
for one million dollars
wired into your account

30:25.757 --> 30:27.358
by this afternoon.

30:27.425 --> 30:29.194
One million dollars?

30:29.260 --> 30:32.330
Enough to pay off your debt.
What do you think?

30:32.397 --> 30:35.033
Yes. Yes, we'll take it.

30:35.099 --> 30:37.702
All right. We'll sign.

30:37.769 --> 30:40.238
Okay. Here's our NDA.
Mm-hmm.

30:41.739 --> 30:43.141
No, thank you.

30:43.208 --> 30:46.477
Okay. Now, I have
a question about...

30:50.481 --> 30:51.783
Is he gonna sign it?

30:53.484 --> 30:56.120
Not until I've read this.

30:57.188 --> 30:59.490
Karen... from Delaware.
Um...

30:59.557 --> 31:01.426
You used to play cricket.
Uh, gentlemen,

31:01.492 --> 31:05.597
um, I think that my client and I
just need a-a second

31:05.663 --> 31:08.633
to discuss this contract.

31:08.700 --> 31:12.036
We'll be right back. Come.

31:12.103 --> 31:15.139
Sean, there is something
you should know

31:15.206 --> 31:17.242
before you sign this NDA.

31:17.308 --> 31:20.445
I thought you said it was fine
to sign if the number was right.

31:20.511 --> 31:22.080
I mean, with a million dollars,

31:22.146 --> 31:24.048
I won't have to file
for bankruptcy.

31:24.115 --> 31:25.617
That is true, but...

31:25.683 --> 31:29.287
we now believe that the faulty
part that caused your crash

31:29.354 --> 31:32.257
was installed on Northbrook's
entire new fleet of planes.

31:32.323 --> 31:34.626
What does that have
to do with me?

31:34.692 --> 31:36.361
I mean, they'll have
to fix it, right?

31:36.427 --> 31:38.763
I overheard Dirk's
assistant saying

31:38.830 --> 31:40.632
that they were
settling with you

31:40.698 --> 31:42.467
so the launch date
can remain as is.

31:42.533 --> 31:45.336
Launch date?
MARGARET:
Northbrook is about

31:45.403 --> 31:47.238
to release an entire
new fleet of planes

31:47.305 --> 31:49.240
exactly like the one
that caused your crash.

31:49.307 --> 31:51.342
And they have no intention of
fixing them before the release,

31:51.409 --> 31:53.144
because it would
cost them millions.

31:53.211 --> 31:58.182
And with missed deliveries
and lost sales, billions.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.985
(sighs)
So all these planes
could crash, too?

32:01.052 --> 32:02.353
I mean, why would they do that?

32:02.420 --> 32:04.122
Why wouldn't they just
fix them first?

32:04.188 --> 32:05.556
Northbrook has calculated

32:05.623 --> 32:07.692
a small probability of a crash.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.494
It only happens
in the extreme cold.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.462
And since there were no deaths
on your flight,

32:11.529 --> 32:14.465
it seems that they would rather
pay the insurance premiums

32:14.532 --> 32:16.367
and keep business going.

32:16.434 --> 32:19.604
So, this all falls on me?

32:19.671 --> 32:22.106
I have to stand up
to this giant corporation?

32:22.173 --> 32:24.342
If we refuse
this settlement,

32:24.409 --> 32:26.511
there is no guarantee
that we will win in court.

32:26.577 --> 32:30.381
But if you sign this NDA, no one
will ever hear this story,

32:30.448 --> 32:32.717
and Dirk Dobkin can keep
his faulty planes

32:32.784 --> 32:34.719
up in the air.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.321
I just want to restart my life.

32:36.387 --> 32:39.357
Sean, I want you to know
that it wouldn't be just you

32:39.424 --> 32:41.359
standing up
to a giant corporation.

32:41.426 --> 32:44.062
We'd be right there with you.
Yeah.

32:49.267 --> 32:51.302
(sighs)

32:53.171 --> 32:55.440
A million dollars
is a lot of money.

33:01.346 --> 33:03.414
MARGARET:
We are not going
to sign the NDA.

33:03.481 --> 33:06.984
(scoffs) There's not gonna
be another offer.

33:07.051 --> 33:08.319
This is it.

33:08.386 --> 33:11.222
So just sign the NDA.
Okay. Easy now.

33:11.289 --> 33:13.024
Easy. Easy, Dirk.
It's all right.

33:13.091 --> 33:14.492
All right.
Hey.

33:14.559 --> 33:15.760
You want to take
a break?

33:15.827 --> 33:17.428
Yeah.
Take a break. Yeah.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.464
I got it.

33:21.366 --> 33:24.168
Counsel, if your client doesn't
take this offer,

33:24.235 --> 33:26.204
there is no money for him.

33:27.372 --> 33:29.440
My client is not going
to sign something

33:29.507 --> 33:31.709
that will put the lives
of future Northbrook passengers

33:31.776 --> 33:34.746
in jeopardy--
a responsibility

33:34.812 --> 33:36.614
that is rightfully
your client's.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.349
LYLE:
I've ruled out
all the go-to ciphers.

33:38.416 --> 33:41.486
It's not any modern
or ancient language.

33:41.552 --> 33:43.354
I believe
she created this code herself.

33:43.421 --> 33:46.290
Wait. Hold on.
This is the crossword

33:46.357 --> 33:47.725
that was on Tyesha's fridge.

33:47.792 --> 33:50.061
All the answers
are wrong. See?

33:50.128 --> 33:53.631
Okay, 40 down. "Jeff
Goldblum versus spacemen"?

33:53.698 --> 33:56.100
She wrote "Alien Prometheus."
That's not it?

33:56.167 --> 33:58.536
No, it's Independence Day.
Huh.

33:58.603 --> 34:00.371
Huh.
She loves puzzles.

34:00.438 --> 34:02.273
Has a mind for wordplay.
This isn't a woman

34:02.340 --> 34:05.543
who'd get one answer wrong,
let alone all of them.

34:05.610 --> 34:07.178
Let me look
at this journal.

34:07.245 --> 34:08.613
MARGARET:
Do you think that's the key?

34:08.679 --> 34:11.549
I do. If we don't find Tyesha,
Sean gets nothing.

34:11.616 --> 34:13.551
Let's hope
it's a simple cipher.

34:13.618 --> 34:15.286
Write the alphabet
across the top

34:15.353 --> 34:16.988

on the left down.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.756

34:33.838 --> 34:36.174

Let the record show Ms. Johnson
is pointing to a man

38:34.311 --> 38:38.015
in the gallery in a black shirt,
bald head and beard.

38:38.082 --> 38:39.650
His name is Nathan Shaw,
Your Honor,

38:39.717 --> 38:44.021
and he is a fixer for Nugent
Cross Public Relations.

38:44.088 --> 38:45.222
He's currently employed--

38:45.289 --> 38:47.024
and I might add,
under the table--

38:47.091 --> 38:49.226
by Northbrook Aerospace.

38:49.293 --> 38:52.430
I have admitted as Exhibit 1
photos of Mr. Shaw

38:52.496 --> 38:55.099
harassing and stalking
my witness.

38:55.166 --> 38:58.602
Bailiff, please take Mr. Shaw
into custody

38:58.669 --> 39:00.137
on witness intimidation.

Sir, come with me.

What are we gonna do?

We're gonna hope they don't
throw your ass in jail, too.

MARGARET:
Your Honor,
the evidence admitted,

39:11.449 --> 39:13.718
along with Ms. Johnson's
testimony,

39:13.784 --> 39:15.586
is more than enough
to move us to trial.

39:15.653 --> 39:17.955
We are looking at
punitive damages,

39:18.022 --> 39:21.492
as well as personal
and potentially criminal

39:21.559 --> 39:25.029
liability for CEO Dirk Dobkin.

39:26.063 --> 39:28.999
(exhales)
Your Honor?

39:30.468 --> 39:33.704
I believe we need
a brief recess.

39:33.771 --> 39:37.508
Wait, how did you know
I was checking my Google Drive?

39:37.575 --> 39:39.143
I didn't. I-I hoped.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.445
But you led us right to it
with your crossword.

39:41.512 --> 39:43.180
You like crosswords?

39:43.247 --> 39:46.484
Yeah, I like puzzles.
Codes. Escape rooms.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.119

39:48.185 --> 39:49.553
Really?
Yeah.

39:49.620 --> 39:51.288
MARGARET:
No, no, no.

39:51.355 --> 39:54.158

there's an injunction order

39:54.225 --> 39:56.160

39:56.227 --> 39:58.095
until we confirm
removal of the part.

39:58.162 --> 40:00.131

40:00.197 --> 40:02.333
Well, if you're gonna be
a little baby about it, okay.

40:02.399 --> 40:05.136
But I want
restitution for Tyesha.

40:05.202 --> 40:07.471
And 12 million for Sean.

40:08.339 --> 40:10.641
Look, I'm gonna draw up
the contract

40:10.708 --> 40:13.144

my client from the puddle

40:27.858 --> 40:30.561
