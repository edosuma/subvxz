04:07.267 --> 04:08.938
I do not fear you,
ugly thing.

04:08.939 --> 04:11.691
My heart is pure
as a fresh water spring.

04:14.195 --> 04:17.577
The Silver Knight Gothic was standing,
facing the terrible skeleton dragon.

04:17.678 --> 04:20.817
That stared at him,
with his big, ugly empty eyes.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.851
With my silver daggers
I shall lop off your head.

04:24.852 --> 04:25.852
Jus ...

04:26.047 --> 04:28.644
Justice will be done only
when you are dead.

04:32.686 --> 04:35.634
The terrible skeleton dragon 
stumbled and staggered

04:35.756 --> 04:39.007
and collapsed with an agonizing groan,
that sent shivers down the spine.

04:42.352 --> 04:46.771
The frail King emerged from his hiding place
to congratulate the noble Silver Knight Gothic.

04:47.152 --> 04:49.513
Enough you little pest.
Clean everything up.

04:49.896 --> 04:52.540
But my lord Gildas,
I am playing the "Silver Knight Gothic."

04:52.659 --> 04:55.947
Your uncle, the good lord Arnold,
awaits us for supper.

05:13.835 --> 05:15.935
Still no sign of them, my good lord?

05:16.945 --> 05:19.301
Nothing, Gildas, nothing at all.

05:19.607 --> 05:26.006
I can no longer see, but I am absolutely certain
 my faithful knights will never return.

05:28.526 --> 05:31.645
With all due respect, my lord,
you have allowed dispair to overcome you ...

05:31.628 --> 05:33.804
Do you want me to dance a Jig?

05:35.429 --> 05:36.978
Come, come now mi'lord ...

05:37.363 --> 05:42.826
Where are those days of yore when my
castle did shine in all its glory?

05:44.905 --> 05:48.331
Where are my men, my guards,
my five players?

05:49.609 --> 05:51.893
Alas they have all fled, my good lord.

05:51.893 --> 05:55.087
I may be blind, Gildas,
but I am nobodys fool.

05:55.088 --> 05:59.220
It is quite clear that no one wishes to
remain in this fortress.

06:01.034 --> 06:04.770
Who would want to live here,
in fear of the World Gobbler.

06:04.771 --> 06:09.014
Speaking of which, it is night time to send
your niece to a safe haven.

06:09.015 --> 06:11.378
To the convent of the crooked
tooth Sisters.

06:12.694 --> 06:15.817
 Ahh Gildas, if only I'dve had a nephew ...

06:17.033 --> 06:20.432
I could have taught him the basic principles
of Dragon hunting.

06:20.433 --> 06:23.336
Oh, yes, please Uncle, that would be so darn neat.

06:23.337 --> 06:28.229
It's not that I would rather have you be a boy,
my little girl, but the fact is you are not one.

06:30.474 --> 06:33.370
Hunting just isn't suitable for little girls.

06:43.045 --> 06:44.577
It's Granion of Bismuth, my uncle.

06:47.863 --> 06:48.912
Granion ...

06:49.383 --> 06:50.231
You're alive!

06:51.659 --> 06:54.917
And the World Gobbler,
have you seen him, have you slain him?

07:00.806 --> 07:04.020
Cease your stupid groaning!
I'll take you late.

07:04.020 --> 07:06.545
Now where are my other loyal knights?

07:06.580 --> 07:10.485
With all due respect, my lord, our faithful
Granion is but a pile of ashes.

07:16.719 --> 07:20.099
- The Smoldering Knights ...
- Another sign, my lord.

07:20.721 --> 07:23.537
Raise the Drawbridge, 
lower the Portcullis.

07:23.538 --> 07:27.526
- We've got to get a bigger Knight.
- You, go pack your bags, you're going to the crooked tooth ...

07:28.589 --> 07:31.908
Lock all the doors,
and bring me my battleaxe and sword.

07:32.125 --> 07:33.209
Gildas!

07:39.979 --> 07:41.592
We've got to get the Silver Knight Gothic.

08:13.607 --> 08:17.458
The tail Lian-chu, the tail. Teach him a lesson.
You hear me? Go on!

08:17.559 --> 08:19.536
Hit him in the tail!
Go! Go!

08:39.405 --> 08:41.335
On your feet.
Keep your guard up.

08:45.406 --> 08:48.335
And don't let him barf on you.

09:54.875 --> 09:55.902
Victory.

10:07.202 --> 10:08.874
Okay, fun's over guys.

10:14.773 --> 10:17.237
Let's see, here we go;
Article 3, clause 2: states

10:17.238 --> 10:20.530
Upon receipt of the slain Momularis,
 Fat John of Wickashire shall 

10:20.591 --> 10:23.897
pay the measly sum of 24 Guinneas
to the valerous dragon hunters.

10:23.897 --> 10:27.096
I do not see any hunters.
All I see is a bevy of clowns.

10:27.497 --> 10:28.930
Walking disaster.

10:30.363 --> 10:33.988
Look what your bonehead there did to my cabbage
patch with his goofball antics.

10:35.597 --> 10:39.691
Fat John of Wickashire, look at me.
Isn't that your x there at the bottom of the contract?

10:39.724 --> 10:43.377
Enough said river rat,
you're gettin' diddly squat.

10:43.585 --> 10:47.098
Do you want to get my muscle bulging
buddy all riled up, is that what you want?

10:48.078 --> 10:49.587
Move out of my fields.

10:49.821 --> 10:51.787
And take the clown with you.

10:55.342 --> 10:57.347
Oooh, the mutt wants his doggy food huh?

11:11.590 --> 11:12.347
Dear me.

11:12.382 --> 11:14.113
Great, I just tore my tights.

11:24.638 --> 11:26.722
What's the matter Gwizdo, are you mad?

11:27.298 --> 11:30.940
You think, that for once
you could take your job seriously?

11:30.941 --> 11:32.964
It is always the same old circus, Lian-chu.

11:32.965 --> 11:35.965
All you do is clown around for the peanut gallery.

11:36.294 --> 11:37.731
But I don't do it on purpose.

11:37.732 --> 11:41.327
And it's a blimey good thing too ... 
Why, praytell, do you think these hicks never pay?

11:41.934 --> 11:43.203
Because they've got no money?

11:44.464 --> 11:47.006
No! They rip us off
because you're not credible.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.055
What does credible mean?
- I do not know ...

11:50.056 --> 11:51.767
Take Hector here for example.

11:52.476 --> 11:55.526
Hector, with his big fangs and all that fur,
well, he's credible.

11:55.527 --> 11:58.202
And that's why the hicks are scared of him.
You get it?

12:00.833 --> 12:01.736
You don't get it ...

12:01.886 --> 12:05.508
Look, a dragon hunter who's credible
makes the whole earth shake when he walks.

12:05.509 --> 12:07.509
Right? Like ... 
Boom, Boom ...

12:12.041 --> 12:15.183
And if he has to,
he smacks his debtors a couple of times.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.062
Fork over the money!
Get the picture?

12:18.508 --> 12:20.794
Hitting customers,
that's being credible?

12:21.829 --> 12:23.017
Another example ...

12:23.412 --> 12:26.239
Do you think it's credible a dragon hunter
who likes to knit?

12:26.240 --> 12:27.453
But I tore a hole in my ...

12:27.454 --> 12:31.315
You got Mandular boogers on the brain or what?
You knucklehead, knitting is something old ladies do.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.728
It was my mother who taught me.

14:02.431 --> 14:05.428
Look, I'm sorry, I did'nt really mean what I said about knitting

14:05.429 --> 14:08.883
If you want a more credible friend,
why don't you go look for one?

14:08.884 --> 14:11.653
Do not be ridiculous, I could never
find a better friend than you.

14:11.966 --> 14:14.721
- You're just saying that so I won't be angry.
- Stop it.

14:14.722 --> 14:18.582
Who do you want me to hire as a partner?
Fat John of Wickashire?

14:22.045 --> 14:24.601
No way, we're a real team, 
me and you.

14:27.319 --> 14:30.404
Yeah, Hector.
The three of us.

14:33.325 --> 14:36.670
Say Gwizdo, you think we'll
have our little farm someday?

14:36.471 --> 14:39.006
Of course we will, you'll see.

14:38.807 --> 14:43.960
A quiet little house on the water.
And we'll have chickens, cows, pigs ...

14:43.706 --> 14:44.935
And we can have sheep.

14:46.644 --> 14:47.317
For the wool.

14:47.317 --> 14:51.070
Yeah, right, and you'll knit me a 
shawl and wollen underwear for the winter.

14:53.007 --> 14:53.737
What?

14:56.285 --> 14:58.427
- Electric Dragons.
- This might make some quick cash.

15:01.956 --> 15:03.978
Lian-chu, wait for me!

16:39.754 --> 16:41.428
Whoa! 
Silver Knight Gothic.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.648
Uhm, no, it's me ... Lian-chu.

16:45.652 --> 16:47.195
You just saved my life, my ...

16:54.074 --> 16:57.178
Lordy leapin lizards,
two grilled jimbobs for the price of one.

16:57.179 --> 17:00.116
Well, when I say price, 
it's just my way of talking, k?

17:01.677 --> 17:05.544
Now we got two jimbob dragons,  night terror ...
30 Guineas are payable on delivery.

17:05.545 --> 17:06.941
Got the money on you, kid?

17:07.660 --> 17:08.914
- Umm, no.
- Figures.

17:08.949 --> 17:11.542
But of course your daddys got money, right?
Where are your parents?

17:11.683 --> 17:12.887
They're dead, mister.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.170
Ahh, What misfortune ...

17:15.171 --> 17:16.904
Once again we work for peanuts!

17:16.905 --> 17:19.740
What you been doing in the woods at night,
without a Guinea in your pocket?

17:19.741 --> 17:23.827
Uuh I'm looking for a noble knights
for my uncle, who is very, very rich.

17:24.113 --> 17:26.217
Wait a minute, very, very rich?

17:26.218 --> 17:29.116
You are real knights,
aren't you, my lord?

17:31.671 --> 17:34.618
The knight Lian-chu was hiding
behind the village gates.

17:34.619 --> 17:37.937
The sun was up, bloodthirsty
dragons were attacking from all sides,

17:37.938 --> 17:39.906
The Knight Lian-chu was alone,
you see?

17:39.907 --> 17:41.801
- Alone against all odds.
- And then?

17:41.836 --> 17:45.158
And then, Knight Lian-chu grabs
onto a roof by the tips of his teeth.

17:45.159 --> 17:46.577
- By his teeth?
- Yeah!

17:46.759 --> 17:48.881
And he leaps above the horde holloring ...

17:50.315 --> 17:52.571
And after that, after that, my lord?

17:52.606 --> 17:54.988
After that, Knight
Lian-chu jumps into the crowd,

17:54.989 --> 17:57.227
A smack here -
and a whack there.

17:57.767 --> 18:00.561
Wham bam thank you ma'am,
he ducks, a sword in each hand.

18:00.562 --> 18:04.591
And he sends them all flying with a kick to the butt,
a real massacre.

18:05.620 --> 18:07.503
-Wow                    
- They took about a whole weekto clear the village.

18:08.082 --> 18:10.162
Whoa, that's ... unreal.

18:14.656 --> 18:17.842
Almost as fabulous as
Silver Knight Gothic.

18:18.216 --> 18:21.419
- Eh, What? Competition?
- Silver Knight Gothic.

18:21.671 --> 18:25.053
The hero of legends.
He also slaps around dragons.

18:25.054 --> 18:27.750
With strength, courage and generous spirit.

18:28.060 --> 18:28.504
Oh yeah?

18:28.985 --> 18:31.589
Well, its kind of like that,
except for the generous part.

18:31.767 --> 18:34.458
One shouldn't believe everything you
read in fairy tales, right kid?

18:34.509 --> 18:35.955
You see, were more of a ...

18:36.756 --> 18:37.961
Wandering Knights.

18:39.171 --> 18:42.337
In any case, Uncle Arnold
is going to be happy to see you.

18:54.612 --> 18:56.421
Real big.

19:01.798 --> 19:04.060
I'm going to have to be darn credible now.

19:06.047 --> 19:08.209
My lords and ladies ...

19:08.210 --> 19:11.043
How ya doin? Put a smile and
open up your bulging purses.

19:11.044 --> 19:14.459
Sir Gwizdo and Knight Lian-chu,
the greatest dragon hunters of ...

19:14.460 --> 19:16.838
Who dares to disturb me
during my CLISTER.

19:16.839 --> 19:20.527
With all due respect my lord, it is two
miserable louts and your niece.

19:20.528 --> 19:21.926
- Not at all.
- Zoé.

19:21.927 --> 19:24.529
They are wandering knights, uncle.
They just saved my life.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.970
Go to your room,
you little runaway.

19:26.971 --> 19:27.971
Uncle ...

19:27.972 --> 19:29.783
Tomorrow it's off to the crooked tooth..

19:35.666 --> 19:40.530
You, what feats have you done?
besides putting up with my niece?

19:40.758 --> 19:44.745
Eh, us? well, uh, The noble knight
Lian-chu is famous in many a land,

19:44.745 --> 19:47.257
and his fearless feats have
inspired so many before him

19:47.257 --> 19:49.204
- that the ...
- Spare me the folklore.

19:49.205 --> 19:51.260
Warrior, take a step forward.

19:57.432 --> 19:59.152
He's got muscles ...

19:59.152 --> 20:01.513
and, uh, raw power!

20:02.170 --> 20:04.771
Yes, the attributes
of a true warrior.

20:04.772 --> 20:07.156
Your Highness, if you please,
they are but ...

20:07.157 --> 20:08.530
Shut up, Gildas.

20:08.540 --> 20:12.029
Lets roll son,
I have a mission for you.

20:46.714 --> 20:51.694
Every twenty seasons,
the most terrifying dragon alive wakes up,

20:51.695 --> 20:55.063
and leaves his lair
at the far end of the world.

20:55.064 --> 21:00.395
When he comes, he devours entire regions,
burns villages by the hundreds ...

21:00.396 --> 21:02.360
swallows fortresses whole,

21:02.361 --> 21:07.076
before returning to his lair,
leaving only ashes behind.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.077
Gildas!

21:13.999 --> 21:18.135
I have inscribed on this calendar
all of the signs of his awakening.

21:18.136 --> 21:20.998
Look, the Crenelations collapse.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.507
The smoldering Knights.

21:24.328 --> 21:25.571
The red cloud.

21:26.150 --> 21:28.191
the bridges sailing away.

21:28.593 --> 21:30.633
The sinking villages.

21:30.634 --> 21:32.668
And talking animals.

21:35.049 --> 21:38.121
When all of these signs have appeared,
my boy,

21:38.122 --> 21:42.106
He will have returned ...
the Devourer of Life.

21:44.096 --> 21:46.022
The World Gobbler.

21:47.524 --> 21:49.465
I have seen him son.

21:49.466 --> 21:52.800
I once lifted my sword before him.

21:52.801 --> 21:58.332
And the mere sight of his fiery gaze
drove my own eyes back into my skull.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.520
Since then, all I can see
is a dead grey landscape

22:01.520 --> 22:09.150
a terrible place where there is no life,
and no joy.

22:13.438 --> 22:15.742
What is that little tree there,
next to the dragon?

22:16.249 --> 22:18.523
That is for scale dear Knight.

22:20.558 --> 22:23.510
Go to his kingdom, enter his lair,

22:23.510 --> 22:26.054
far off in the west,
beyond the end of the world ...

22:26.055 --> 22:28.600
and strike him while he sleeps.

22:28.919 --> 22:30.783
Before its too late.

22:30.784 --> 22:33.454
Yeah, yeah, yeah ...
but no.

22:33.455 --> 22:36.579
It is a cruel blow, but uh look at that,
were all booked up.

22:36.580 --> 22:39.592
Strike him dead and the world will be saved.

22:39.593 --> 22:42.004
Lian-chu, say goodbye,
were disturbing the man.

22:42.005 --> 22:44.907
My health and sight will return.

22:45.408 --> 22:48.527
And I will cover you in gold.

22:59.784 --> 23:03.742
Dear client, if you can make room for
his head in your museum of horrors.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.482
But first let me show you our 
standard contract.

23:06.483 --> 23:08.126
Special little advance for
travel expenses.

23:08.127 --> 23:09.962
And since were among
noble knights ...

23:09.963 --> 23:13.309
A large purse of gold should 
do the trick nicely.

23:13.407 --> 23:15.318
Modern methods, why not?

23:15.319 --> 23:16.319
Gildas!

23:22.193 --> 23:25.729
Yah, just put an X there, here, here and there.

23:26.437 --> 23:28.410
Roll, roll, roll.

23:36.411 --> 23:37.969
The red cloud, my lord.

23:45.887 --> 23:48.689
Saddle up my good brave Knights.

23:50.961 --> 23:53.933
Keep heading west my lords,
until the end of the world.

23:53.934 --> 23:57.080
Yes, for sure, for sure, old man. Of course Gildas.
Say hi to the misses will ya?

24:17.905 --> 24:19.463
Yes, yes, Ha, ha ha!

24:20.110 --> 24:22.521
Yes! Yes! Who who who!

24:39.017 --> 24:40.064
Where you going?

24:40.368 --> 24:44.240
Coiff a cold one buddy, is not every day that
we get to rip off a blind of geezer.

24:44.507 --> 24:46.118
That's not the way
to the end of the world.

24:46.817 --> 24:50.536
Lian-chu, don't you understand, 
who cares about their end of the world?

24:50.537 --> 24:52.548
We are rich.
You know what this is?

24:52.549 --> 24:55.249
- An advance?
- This is our little farm, buddy.

24:55.250 --> 24:57.850
The one of our comfy little dreams,
with sheep everywhere?

24:58.051 --> 25:00.195
Now let's get out of here,
while the beasties are busy.

25:03.274 --> 25:04.424
I am coming with you, my lords.

25:05.954 --> 25:08.062
What? Zoé, you can't
be serious.

25:08.063 --> 25:09.030
Sure I am.

25:09.065 --> 25:11.176
My uncle told me I had to come with
you to the end of the world.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.235
Oh really? Weren't you punished?

25:13.236 --> 25:17.330
No. .. And what he also said was that 
I should learn the rudiments of the trade.

25:17.365 --> 25:20.235
No, no, no and no.

25:20.508 --> 25:24.727
You go home, explain to Uncle Arnold
that, Lord Gwizdo does not take on apprentices.

25:24.728 --> 25:28.306
He also said that if you don't
want to take me, he would ...

25:28.307 --> 25:29.533
He would ... what?

25:30.265 --> 25:32.886
He would spank your
bare bottom in public.

25:32.887 --> 25:35.154
My bare bottom?
In public?

26:35.957 --> 26:38.987
For crying out loud,
and he's spitting fire besides!

26:40.412 --> 26:43.410
No, what I meant was he
was doing it with his mouth, Hector.

26:52.441 --> 26:53.979
I don't see what's so funny.

27:46.029 --> 27:49.644
Wow! You sure messed up that big red dragon good,
Sir Lian-chu.

27:49.897 --> 27:54.075
That was so unreal,
I am so fabulously impressed.

27:54.657 --> 27:57.378
I've got to ...
find my flail.

27:57.484 --> 28:01.780
Your funny sword? Wait for me,
Sir Lian-chu, I'm going to find it for you.

28:01.781 --> 28:04.927
Okay, Sir Lian-chu's groupy,
your backstage chatter

28:05.022 --> 28:07.193
is very close to driving me bonkers.

28:07.194 --> 28:08.809
Tough luck for the public spanking.

28:08.882 --> 28:09.515
... so fabulously ...

28:09.933 --> 28:10.340
Zoé.

28:10.841 --> 28:12.854
You grab your bag and you get lost.

28:12.909 --> 28:15.896
You go home now.
We Don't travel well with little kids.

28:27.847 --> 28:32.448
Strange, but I have this funny feeling
that some real doo doo is gonna start flying.

28:32.483 --> 28:36.294
And Sir Knight Lian-chu was on the western bridge,
with a big red dragon ...

28:36.295 --> 28:39.990
who's breathing fire, and said to him,
in his big, deep voice:

28:39.991 --> 28:43.610
<i><b> I am not scared of you, Big Red,
one move from you and you are dead. </ b> </ i></b></i>

28:43.611 --> 28:47.231
Who is the man of a thousand teeth

28:47.232 --> 28:49.871
The terror of dragons far and near

28:53.956 --> 28:56.176
Who is the man of the day

28:56.177 --> 29:01.344
It is him, of course, Silver Knight Gothic.

29:01.457 --> 29:03.138
How did you become a
real Knight, Lian-chu?

29:03.139 --> 29:04.496
Did you go to knight school?

29:04.497 --> 29:07.093
Wow this is really unreal
taking me with you.

29:07.094 --> 29:09.187
I mean,
really unreal!

29:09.604 --> 29:11.658
Are there girl knights?
Cause me, I want to be a girl knight.

29:11.659 --> 29:14.588
And that time you were hanging from the tips of your teeth ...
How'd you do that?

29:14.589 --> 29:17.266
And your funny sword there, is it a magic sword?

29:18.485 --> 29:19.889
Umm, uh, I don't really know know.

29:19.889 --> 29:21.988
The Silver Knight Gothic, he's modest too.

29:21.989 --> 29:22.594
He always says:

29:22.594 --> 29:25.160
<i><b>  The modesty is the sign of
great knights like me. </ b> </ i></b></i>

29:25.161 --> 29:26.792
He's my favorite fairy tale hero.

29:26.793 --> 29:28.368
I would love to meet him one day.

29:28.369 --> 29:32.057
And become his best friend,
and his future girl knight ... unreal.

29:32.058 --> 29:35.056
But you can't in real life.
Uh huh bummer.

29:35.937 --> 29:38.729
I can't take it.
I'm gonna hang myself.

29:40.614 --> 29:41.811
They're only blisters.

29:43.000 --> 29:43.943
Put some herbs on 'em.

29:44.043 --> 29:46.750
I'm not talking about my blisters,
I am talking about princess blabber mouth.

29:46.850 --> 29:49.989
A fire, a fire,
let's make a big fire!

29:52.314 --> 29:55.995
In any case, did you see how
credible I am with her?

29:56.095 --> 29:56.545
Yeah

29:56.645 --> 30:00.139
But the idea of being credible, Lian-Chu was
take Uncle Arnold's money and run.

30:00.139 --> 30:02.890
Not to play the knights and dragons,
till the end of the world.

30:02.891 --> 30:05.720
The best friend of Lian-Chu always
went to get wood for the fire

30:05.720 --> 30:08.595
along with the
funny blue dog who talks.

30:10.387 --> 30:15.487
Say there sir, am I mistaken or is
your dog is a bit weird?

30:15.827 --> 30:17.605
So, are you going to tell her that
we are not real knights?

30:17.605 --> 30:21.867
Yeah, right, and that we ripped off uncle fish eyes ...
and then she goes and spills the beans.

30:22.106 --> 30:24.331
No buddy,
we're in deep doo doo here.

30:25.492 --> 30:27.532
He sure is weird.

30:27.595 --> 30:28.900
But what do we do now?

30:29.000 --> 30:29.885
Ditch her in the woods.

30:29.985 --> 30:33.309
There is no crying, no fuss, no
explanations ... Yeah, it's a sure fire method.

30:33.409 --> 30:36.554
And with a little luck she'll be
gobbled up by wild beasts.

30:36.654 --> 30:37.619
Are you sure?

30:37.719 --> 30:38.474
You bet I am.

30:38.574 --> 30:40.433
That World Gobbler and his of the little tree?

30:40.433 --> 30:41.389
Not for me.

30:41.424 --> 30:44.062
Tonight we'll wait till she falls asleep,
and zip, we're out of here.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.132
Whose is this?

30:48.456 --> 30:50.456
It's Gwizdo's.

30:50.836 --> 30:52.090
That's so funny, sir ...

30:52.548 --> 30:55.800
I'm really sorry, but knitting is for grannies.

30:55.835 --> 30:56.542
No, it's not.

30:56.642 --> 30:57.498
It certainly is.

30:57.598 --> 31:00.015
She is absolutely right. Knitting
is for old ladies.

31:00.115 --> 31:03.277
The truth is my mother taught me
and knitting relaxes me ...

31:03.377 --> 31:05.287
especially after a long hard day.

31:05.387 --> 31:09.637
So scram, scat, and go
play with good old fido.

31:29.690 --> 31:31.709
You really have a super ton of scars, sir.

31:31.809 --> 31:33.413
Say, those are hunting wounds,
right?

31:33.513 --> 31:35.297
Do they hurt? Me too. I've got some.

31:35.397 --> 31:37.344
That one was a wild squirrel when I
was playing in the trees.

31:37.444 --> 31:40.481
And rhat was a duck that was
fabulously angry one day.

31:40.581 --> 31:42.809
We used to have tons of ducks before
my parents died of Cholera.

31:42.909 --> 31:44.568
And then my uncle brought me
to his fortress.

31:44.668 --> 31:46.668
Don't you ever get tired?

31:46.915 --> 31:50.808
Sure, but I always need a
bed time story to get me to sleep.

31:50.908 --> 31:51.889
A bed time story?

31:51.989 --> 31:53.866
Oh yes, just a short one.

31:53.966 --> 31:54.884
Please, sir.

31:54.984 --> 31:57.742
You mean just one short story
and you go to sleep?

31:57.842 --> 32:02.894
Hey hey, no problem then, but it's one story
and then bedie bye, right? Then you fall asleep, okay?

32:02.994 --> 32:04.994
Let's do it.

32:10.964 --> 32:12.964
Silver Knight Gothic.

32:13.995 --> 32:18.198
And brave Silver Knight Gothic wrenched
the terrifying creature out of the shadows,

32:18.298 --> 32:22.025
His shiny scales were dripping
blood from the children he had just devoured ...

32:22.125 --> 32:26.043
 and whose terrifying screams still echoed
in the bone chilling wind of the labarynth.

32:26.143 --> 32:28.194
The fat slimy creature growled ...

32:28.294 --> 32:30.446
revealing his
sharp, crooked, yellow fangs

32:30.546 --> 32:32.296
he moved away from the oozing wall.

32:32.396 --> 32:35.042
The Silver Knight Gothic stared him
 straight in the eye and said,

32:35.142 --> 32:36.693
with a voice that did not waiver:

32:36.793 --> 32:40.533
I am not afraid of you,
dreadful thing

32:40.795 --> 32:45.361
for my heart is pure
as a fresh water spring.

32:45.461 --> 32:50.391
With my silver daggers
I shall lop off your head ...

32:50.632 --> 32:53.195
and justice will be done only
when you are dead.

32:53.295 --> 32:56.645
And the Silver Knight Gothic threw his silver daggers
that sparkle like diamonds

32:56.745 --> 32:59.260
and the monster died a terrible agony.

33:01.073 --> 33:03.423
Well, I never ...

33:04.081 --> 33:05.902
It's no wonder this girl
is a live wire.

33:06.002 --> 33:09.232
Kids should not be reading this stuff.

33:12.231 --> 33:17.392
Hey, she is fast asleep, Lian-Chu,
This is our chance, lets go.

33:17.492 --> 33:19.872
Hey, Lian-Chu, are you asleep?

33:21.467 --> 33:24.097
Come on, Lian-Chu,
Get up. Can you hear me?

33:24.197 --> 33:25.843
Lian-Chu, wake up.

33:25.943 --> 33:27.684
Hurry will ya', yah, look at me.

33:27.784 --> 33:30.704
Get up, get up, come on, come on Lian-Chu.

33:30.807 --> 33:32.108
Hey buddy, wake up.

33:32.109 --> 33:33.750
Can you hear me?

33:41.985 --> 33:42.976
Have a bad sleep?

33:43.076 --> 33:46.754
Tonight if you start snoring
again, I'm chopping of your nose.

33:48.077 --> 33:49.132
I was faking.

33:49.232 --> 33:50.342
What?

33:50.442 --> 33:51.862
You did that?

33:51.962 --> 33:53.158
But that is immoral.

33:53.258 --> 33:55.623
One doesn't abandon
children in the woods ...

33:55.723 --> 33:57.073
Of course you do.

33:57.173 --> 34:01.546
Our little farm Lian-Chu It's right there.
And you because of some little girl who thinks .. 

34:01.646 --> 34:02.935
She will get lost.

34:03.035 --> 34:04.298
I'm ready.

34:04.398 --> 34:08.539
Me, what I really like is a bulgarian omelette,
are the little pieces of mushrooms inside ...

34:08.639 --> 34:13.103
Mmm, unreal ... so I ate the little pieces of mushrooms and
then Gildas he tries to make me eat the eggs.

34:13.204 --> 34:15.754
How bout' you, do you like eggs, sir Lian-Chu?

34:15.755 --> 34:17.554
To be honest, eggs, well I think they smell like stinky ...

34:17.702 --> 34:18.206
Yeah, well ...

34:18.206 --> 34:20.322
We are lost, too old buddy.

35:22.016 --> 35:24.300
Okay, let's be honest,
it's surely not that way.

35:24.400 --> 35:27.026
On the other hand if we take the little
side bridge there, we reach

35:27.126 --> 35:29.207
the pretty little field of daisies
where we were yesterday.

35:29.704 --> 35:32.183
But sir Gwizdo, isn't it that way to the
end of the world?

35:32.283 --> 35:35.129
Okay, so it's fabulously unreal
that were taking you with us on our little adventure,

35:35.229 --> 35:37.797
Why don't you bug off and
let us work.

35:37.897 --> 35:40.624
And besides, no kid's
gonna teach me my geography, ok?

35:40.724 --> 35:44.165
Lensflair. It's sir Lensflair,
one of my uncle's best knights.

35:52.566 --> 35:54.284
Anatole, are you okay?

35:56.714 --> 36:00.029
back off you loony critters,
leave me in peace.

36:01.257 --> 36:04.785
What? But your'e not
animals, are you?

36:04.885 --> 36:06.689
No, its me, Zoé.

36:06.789 --> 36:07.343
Zoé?

36:07.443 --> 36:08.808
Don't you recognize me?

36:08.908 --> 36:10.014
He's stark raving mad.

36:10.114 --> 36:11.305
He wasn't like that before.

36:11.405 --> 36:12.418
Zoé!

36:12.518 --> 36:15.319
I do not fear you, ugly thing.

36:15.419 --> 36:17.712
My heart is pure as
a fresh water spring.

36:19.554 --> 36:21.899
Over there, don't you see a knight?

36:24.780 --> 36:27.598
Quiet, do as
I say, go home.

36:29.083 --> 36:30.732
But, my lord, the World Gobbler?

36:35.708 --> 36:37.428
Forget the World Gobbler, kid.  ...

36:39.481 --> 36:42.541
Are you spilling the beans again you old chatterbox?

36:42.620 --> 36:45.510
No, no I'm not spilling the beans ...

36:46.003 --> 36:48.652
Hey! That's sir Gwizdo and the great knight,
Lian-Chu.

36:48.653 --> 36:51.035
And they are gonna make kindling
out of the World Gobbler.

36:51.525 --> 36:53.820
What? But your mad ...

36:54.009 --> 36:57.664
Yes, you are.
You are mad ... Aren't you? ...

36:57.764 --> 36:58.751
Answer me, I know they are ...

37:01.696 --> 37:05.181
Your mad, mad, I know you are mad.

37:10.534 --> 37:13.701
I'm mad, I'm mad ...
everybody's mad!

37:13.702 --> 37:17.779
Mad, mad ...
I am so mad that I'm mad about being mad.

37:48.179 --> 37:50.782
Sir Lian-Chu, do you often have nightmares?

37:51.945 --> 37:54.248
Me too, often.
The same one.

37:54.283 --> 38:00.240
With the skeleton dragon, enormous, and I scream
and scream but nothing comes out of my mouth.

38:00.567 --> 38:02.951
And the Skeleton Dragon carries 
off everyone in sight.

38:06.682 --> 38:10.009
Sir Lian-Chu ... something around here
smells bad.

38:11.147 --> 38:13.978
And besides, my stomach is in knots,
my hands

38:14.078 --> 38:16.533
are sweaty, and my legs are shaking.

38:16.633 --> 38:18.843
And cold sweat's running down my neck.

38:18.974 --> 38:20.496
Is that normal?

38:20.596 --> 38:24.931
- Sir Lian-Chu, I think ..
I want to ... go back home.
- Shhh ....               

39:18.254 --> 39:20.254
The end of the world.

39:34.594 --> 39:36.974
Where did that village come from?

39:37.526 --> 39:41.776
Scary ghost town,
or stinky forest?

39:43.785 --> 39:46.165
Scary ghost town.

40:15.515 --> 40:17.515
What's the problem?

40:19.436 --> 40:21.436
The big tree.

40:22.660 --> 40:24.660
Yeah, what about it?

40:25.278 --> 40:27.561
Those leaves are really strange.

40:27.661 --> 40:30.466
Good riddance stinky leaves.

40:34.439 --> 40:36.564
It's the crazy bats from the bridge!

41:16.400 --> 41:17.654
Open up.

41:17.754 --> 41:19.754
Sir Gwizdo, open the door ...

41:33.404 --> 41:35.404
Whoa! not the ears, not the ears!

41:54.430 --> 41:56.430
Good move with the barrel, kid.

41:56.628 --> 41:59.008
Yes .. go find your own.

42:47.208 --> 42:50.013
Quit bothering the sheep!

43:47.813 --> 43:50.448
I'll bury you alive, you ugly beast!

44:49.628 --> 44:52.652
<i><b>  Hey bats foo on you, Sir Lian-Chu is
too strong for you. </ b> </ i></b></i>

44:53.029 --> 44:56.930
<i><b>  Hey bats foo on you, Sir Lian-Chu is
too strong for you. </ b> </ i></b></i>

45:08.494 --> 45:11.259
Sir Gwizdo he left me all alone
with the disgusting bats.

45:11.359 --> 45:13.515
I called for help, and he didn't budge.

45:13.516 --> 45:16.262
I knocked on the door, but
he didn't even open it.

46:26.049 --> 46:29.785
And to think we could be
relaxing on our little farm.

46:29.885 --> 46:32.874
We have been talking about our
little farm for eons, right?

46:32.974 --> 46:36.355
Even since Mother Hubbards little
orphan paradise.

46:36.455 --> 46:38.564
Hey, do you remember when we were kids?

46:38.664 --> 46:40.873
When I taught you how to hide
cookies in your underpants,

46:40.973 --> 46:42.669
so the other
kids wouldn't steal them.

46:42.769 --> 46:46.593
And you gave a wedgie to the big guy with
lice every time he took my cookies!

46:46.693 --> 46:50.322
When the World Gobbler is dead,
we can have our little farm.

46:50.422 --> 46:54.566
Oh, right ... the great knight Lian-Chu
is going to say to the World Gobbler:

46:54.666 --> 46:56.029
<i><b>  I do not fear you ugly thing.
</ b> </ i></b></i>

46:56.030 --> 46:59.449
And poof, the World Gobbler is dead, and we're
all happy as pigs.

46:59.559 --> 47:00.131
Stop.

47:00.231 --> 47:00.880
I'm not finished.

47:00.980 --> 47:02.814
And then nature blossoms
and everything is green,

47:02.914 --> 47:05.499
and are little white bunnies
flying all over the place.

47:05.599 --> 47:07.599
Stop!

47:07.720 --> 47:09.351
We're all gonna die!

47:09.451 --> 47:11.332
Because of some little girl
that dreams of knights,

47:11.432 --> 47:13.091
but life's is not a fairy tale.

47:13.191 --> 47:16.168
In real life,
knights, they always die.

47:16.268 --> 47:19.413
I don't want you die, Lian-Chu!

47:19.483 --> 47:23.733
So why don't you step off the village,
if you don't want to come?

47:23.923 --> 47:25.665
Oh, so that's the way it is, huh?

47:25.765 --> 47:28.088
Well that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

47:28.188 --> 47:30.738
Farewell and good riddance, Knight Lian-Chu.

47:33.438 --> 47:34.421
Move.

47:47.598 --> 47:49.820
Why is sir Gwizdo leaving?

47:49.920 --> 47:51.722
Because he says
we are all going to die.

47:51.822 --> 47:53.822
Oh that's a crock of poop.

47:54.211 --> 47:55.608
Maybe he is right, after all.

47:55.708 --> 47:56.868
No, he is not right.

47:56.968 --> 48:01.643
You are the strongest, 
stronger than Silver Knight Gothic.

48:03.789 --> 48:05.968
Gwizdo says that life
isn't a fairy tale.

48:06.068 --> 48:07.749
What does sir Gwizdo know anyway?

48:07.849 --> 48:09.560
And Besides, who is that Gwizdo?

48:09.561 --> 48:11.208
Lord Pain in the Butt?

48:11.371 --> 48:12.859
Sir Old Fart?

48:12.866 --> 48:15.076
Mr. Blister foot?

48:16.362 --> 48:18.657
He was my one friend.

50:45.529 --> 50:46.551
What are you doing here?

50:46.651 --> 50:48.175
Hello, Sir Gwizdo.

50:48.275 --> 50:51.165
So the rats jumping the ship,
is he?

50:51.414 --> 50:52.812
What's this circus all about?

50:52.912 --> 50:55.851
- You're Abandoning your friends.
- Lord McChicken.

50:55.951 --> 50:58.234
Wait a sec', what do you ladies want?

50:58.334 --> 50:59.980
to me feel guilty, is that it?

51:00.080 --> 51:00.937
Scaredy pants.

51:01.037 --> 51:03.417
Scaredy pants?
Yeah, and so what?

51:03.475 --> 51:05.702
You think I look like the hero
of this fairy tale?

51:05.802 --> 51:09.117
And Lian-Chu, what's gonna happen to him?

51:10.089 --> 51:11.394
He won't listen to me.

51:11.394 --> 51:12.767
Sir I'm shaking like a leaf ..

51:12.867 --> 51:14.879
Sir I'm sh-sh-shaking like a leaf.

51:14.979 --> 51:16.025
It's all Zoés fault.

51:16.125 --> 51:17.827
- and the lie.
- Sir rip off artist.

51:17.927 --> 51:18.608
Shut up!

51:18.708 --> 51:20.148
I didn't choose to be small and poor ...

51:20.248 --> 51:21.279
Do not forget ugly and mean.

51:21.379 --> 51:23.520
Exactly, ugly and mean!

51:23.620 --> 51:27.849
Now get out of here, scram
just scram, bats, ahh ...

51:27.949 --> 51:30.972
I do not believe in heroism ...
and "happily ever after."!

51:31.007 --> 51:33.527
and animals that talk! ...

51:36.669 --> 51:38.669
Animals that talk.

51:53.540 --> 51:55.540
Gwizdo.

52:03.393 --> 52:05.393
Zoé.

52:29.198 --> 52:31.198
Lian-Chu.

53:07.679 --> 53:09.679
Sir Lian-Chu.

53:13.721 --> 53:14.787
Sir Lian-Chu.

53:14.887 --> 53:18.627
Weird things are happening
underneath the village.

53:19.194 --> 53:21.194
Just wait for me here.

53:22.219 --> 53:26.237
Tell me honestly kid, what
do I have at the end of my arms?

53:26.337 --> 53:27.178
Hands?

53:27.278 --> 53:29.278
Wrong!

53:30.539 --> 53:32.539
Hello, there little Zoé.

53:34.574 --> 53:37.707
Lian-Chu, Sir Gwizdo is
doing weird things with his hands.

53:37.807 --> 53:41.122
Like knight Lensflair.

54:04.415 --> 54:06.455
We've got to get a bigger village.

54:41.083 --> 54:43.655
Come on now, quit fooling around sir Gwizdo.

54:43.755 --> 54:45.755
It's not funny.

54:47.780 --> 54:50.143
Hello little kiddies. 
Would you like a story?

54:50.243 --> 54:51.968
Yes, yes, tell us a story.

54:52.068 --> 54:55.612
The story about the naive little girl who
mistook two lowly rogues for noble knights ...

54:55.712 --> 54:57.712
No. ..

54:57.786 --> 54:59.465
We've already heard that one ...

54:59.565 --> 55:00.806
Then another one, another one!

55:00.906 --> 55:02.906
Another please, please ...

55:05.276 --> 55:08.076
And the one about the nice hunter 
devoured by the World Gobbler?

55:08.176 --> 55:11.201
Because of some little girl who
dreamed of noble knights!

55:11.301 --> 55:13.851
Yeah, yeah, that one really stinks.

55:13.986 --> 55:18.151
And one of the two red bats that
strangled the little girl?

55:19.382 --> 55:21.847
Oh yes, oh yes, that's the one,
Ha ha ha ha!

55:58.724 --> 56:00.724
Zoé.

56:01.478 --> 56:03.114
Zoé.

56:03.214 --> 56:04.986
Zoé!

56:41.697 --> 56:44.927
I can't feel my legs ...

56:53.053 --> 56:54.673
Your legs are just fine,

56:54.773 --> 56:56.898
you had a bad fall, that's all.

56:58.003 --> 57:00.003
You were right Gwizdo.

57:00.748 --> 57:03.808
Life isn't a fairy tale.

57:05.738 --> 57:07.074
But you know,

57:07.174 --> 57:09.848
It doesn't matter if you're not really.

57:09.948 --> 57:12.923
You're still my favorite heroes.

57:14.665 --> 57:18.772
Lian-Chu, he's even stronger
than Silver Knight Gothic,

57:18.872 --> 57:21.219
and that's no fairy tale.

57:21.319 --> 57:24.294
All you have to do is believe.

57:24.550 --> 57:28.715
But Lian-Chu needs you in order to succeed.

57:30.477 --> 57:33.721
Promise me you'll carry through
 'til the end, Gwizdo ...

57:33.821 --> 57:37.051
and my death won't have been in vain.

57:40.538 --> 57:42.206
 It's a promise Zoé.

57:42.306 --> 57:44.688
We're gonna make kindling out
of the World Gobbler.

57:47.317 --> 57:49.317
Really?

57:49.961 --> 57:51.254
I swear we will.

57:51.354 --> 57:53.354
Oh, thank you, Gwizdo!

57:53.757 --> 57:55.757
But, you ...

57:56.180 --> 57:57.120
You're not hurt?

57:57.220 --> 57:58.489
Nope.

57:58.589 --> 58:00.589
I just fell down there.

58:02.800 --> 58:04.925
You, but that ... that's immoral.

58:05.375 --> 58:07.041
Do you realize what a fright you gave us?

58:07.141 --> 58:08.477
You were really scared?

58:08.577 --> 58:10.081
Of course I was!

58:10.181 --> 58:13.156
That means that love me.

58:18.436 --> 58:19.845
Okay, partys over guys.

58:19.845 --> 58:21.843
We got us a World Gobbler to slay.

59:09.809 --> 59:12.359
What's that giant tree?

59:18.777 --> 59:20.777
<i><b>  It's for scale sir. </ b> </ i></b></i>

59:24.566 --> 59:26.030
That noise, what is it?

59:26.130 --> 59:27.370
Is that an earthquake?

59:27.470 --> 59:28.413
No,

59:28.513 --> 59:30.513
it was snoring.

59:30.730 --> 59:32.730
We have to find it.

01:00:56.548 --> 01:00:58.089
Take cover!

01:00:58.189 --> 01:01:00.189
Monster bat?

01:01:02.306 --> 01:01:04.306
My nightmare ...

01:01:05.487 --> 01:01:08.887
That's the skeleton dragon
of my nightmares.

01:01:39.882 --> 01:01:41.897
Lian-Chu come back!

01:02:22.644 --> 01:02:24.644
Lian-Chu run!

01:02:54.172 --> 01:02:56.341
Help, Lian-Chu!

01:03:17.682 --> 01:03:21.188
I'm sorry Gwizdo, 
we are all going to die!

01:03:21.719 --> 01:03:25.300
Zoé look at me, we gotta
believe, isn't that what you said?

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.702
So hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:03:27.802 --> 01:03:31.032
I believe, I believe, I believe.

01:03:41.976 --> 01:03:47.331
I believe, I believe ...

01:03:55.442 --> 01:03:57.442
Lian-Chu!

01:04:37.284 --> 01:04:39.284
Lian-Chu!

01:04:47.302 --> 01:04:49.302
Leave them alone!

01:05:05.159 --> 01:05:08.049
I do not fear you,
ugly thing.

01:05:08.564 --> 01:05:13.324
My heart is pure as a
fresh water spring.

01:06:03.172 --> 01:06:05.438
Get up Lian-Chu!

01:06:15.406 --> 01:06:17.406
Go for it, Lian-Chu!

01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:08.780
Everything is reall pretty now.

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:19.310
Now over there will be the barn ...

01:08:20.151 --> 01:08:22.151
Oh, and there the chicken coops.

01:08:22.529 --> 01:08:23.899
What do you mean?

01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:25.122
Our little farm old buddy.

01:08:24.881 --> 01:08:26.452
With sheep for your wool.

01:08:29.032 --> 01:08:32.194
And there the mill, for
bread, a big mill.

01:08:32.295 --> 01:08:35.399
And over there your sheep barn,
and when I say sheep barn ..

01:08:35.401 --> 01:08:37.742
I mean a real sheep barn.

01:08:47.982 --> 01:08:49.982
And here, our house.

01:08:55.345 --> 01:08:58.151
With your bed room, my bed room ...

01:09:00.759 --> 01:09:02.759
and Zoés bed room.

01:09:03.252 --> 01:09:06.938
A big room with a view
of the flying bunny rabbits,

01:09:07.037 --> 01:09:08.984
whenever she comes to see us 
during the holidays, right?

01:09:09.084 --> 01:09:11.084
Yes!

01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:20.604
So we gonna go pick up Uncle Arnies cash?

01:09:20.703 --> 01:09:22.703
We certainly deserve it.

01:09:52.162 --> 01:09:55.223
Where are my noble knights?

01:09:57.859 --> 01:10:00.953
But, but my great and wealthy Lord,
we're here ...

01:10:01.053 --> 01:10:01.829
You?

01:10:01.929 --> 01:10:06.689
Yeah, Lian-Chu and Gwizdo,
ya know, dragon hunters.

01:10:08.478 --> 01:10:11.624
All right look, isn't that your X
at the bottom of this parchment?

01:10:11.724 --> 01:10:13.185
Allright, enough of this,

01:10:13.285 --> 01:10:15.109
I don't see any hunters.

01:10:15.209 --> 01:10:17.865
What I see are two coarse and lowly rogues...

01:10:17.965 --> 01:10:21.516
With all due respect, my
Lord, I do believe I did warn you ...

01:10:21.616 --> 01:10:25.403
But Uncle, it's really true,
Lian-Chu killed the World Gobbler.

01:10:25.503 --> 01:10:28.088
that is why you were cured and
nature has blossomed,

01:10:28.188 --> 01:10:29.928
and there are little bunnies everywhere.

01:10:30.028 --> 01:10:33.115
And you little runaway, your
tall tales will get you nowhere.

01:10:33.215 --> 01:10:36.044
They are not tall tales, the Lian-Chu is a hero.

01:10:36.144 --> 01:10:38.354
Get out of my sight insolent girl.

01:10:38.422 --> 01:10:41.222
Your eyes are even more inside out than before.

01:10:41.322 --> 01:10:44.318
Off to the convent, little pest.

01:10:44.629 --> 01:10:46.629
So much the better.

01:10:48.408 --> 01:10:51.629
Because I would rather go
to the crooked tooth convent than

01:10:51.729 --> 01:10:55.255
live with a bitter, heartless, ugly old fart
who doesn't even love me.

01:10:55.355 --> 01:10:57.565
Zoé get back here immediately.

01:10:57.619 --> 01:10:58.904
Zoés right!

01:10:59.004 --> 01:11:02.566
Your really a looser, 
and besides, your mean to little girls ...

01:11:02.666 --> 01:11:07.000
you don't know Zoé, she is kind,
she's courageous, and she's intelligent,

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:11.180
she deserves so much better than a dishonest, 
self centered, meiserly old uncle,

01:11:11.774 --> 01:11:14.386
and with all due respect I have
for the boogers in my nose

01:11:14.486 --> 01:11:20.351
I would like to know what Lord
Arnold, The Butt Wipe, has to say about that!

01:11:29.039 --> 01:11:32.779
Ow, ooh. I tell ya
kings are not respectable people.

01:11:33.317 --> 01:11:36.616
It was when you called him Arnold
the Butt Wipe, that he really got mad.

01:11:36.716 --> 01:11:40.222
Hey, hey, just a sec there Mr. coward,
you could have done something.

01:11:40.322 --> 01:11:42.856
Why, you did a great
job on your own.

01:11:42.956 --> 01:11:45.727
A great job,
are you pulling my leg?

01:11:45.827 --> 01:11:49.992
If it wasn't for you,  Zoé
would have gotten spanked on her bare bottom.

01:11:53.503 --> 01:11:55.075
You know,

01:11:55.175 --> 01:11:57.175
you're right.

01:11:59.546 --> 01:12:02.094
You think that we'll see Zoé again someday?

01:12:02.194 --> 01:12:03.323
Forget about her buddy.

01:12:03.423 --> 01:12:05.061
Look at us, nothing has changed,

01:12:05.161 --> 01:12:11.451
we're still two course and lowly rouges just good
for getting our butts kicked by royalty.

01:12:11.959 --> 01:12:14.479
Hey, wait up for me, noble knights.

01:12:14.579 --> 01:12:16.945
Zoé, what are you doing here?

01:12:17.045 --> 01:12:19.765
The old crooked tooth isn't my style.

01:12:20.308 --> 01:12:23.538
I'm gonna go live on the little farm with you guys.

01:12:23.592 --> 01:12:25.116
What little farm?

01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:28.106
You know, the one you dream of,

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:33.164
with a big mill and the
barn and sheep, for wool.

01:12:37.649 --> 01:12:40.524
Zoé, I love you.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.971
THE END
