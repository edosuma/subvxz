00:00.666 --> 00:01.957
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:04.790 --> 00:06.208
I am Groot!

00:07.000 --> 00:09.499
Slow down? We can't slow down.

00:09.499 --> 00:11.000
This bounty
is worth a million credits.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.166
And we almost got it.

00:17.457 --> 00:18.957
I am Groot.

00:18.957 --> 00:20.166
What do you mean,
"Get a new ship"?

00:20.166 --> 00:21.582
The ship's fine.
(EXPLODING)

00:21.582 --> 00:22.582
(GASPS)

00:24.457 --> 00:26.832
Running just like
the day I bought it.

00:26.832 --> 00:28.416
GROOT: I am Groot.

00:28.416 --> 00:30.374
Of course, I see it,
I'm not going to let us...

00:30.374 --> 00:31.582
(SCREAMS)

00:34.624 --> 00:35.374
Uh-oh.

00:37.166 --> 00:38.832
GROOT: I am Groot.

00:40.666 --> 00:41.416
(GROANING)

00:44.333 --> 00:45.666
GROOT: I am Groot.

00:45.666 --> 00:48.582
ROCKET: I told you,
our ship is fine.

00:48.582 --> 00:51.124
Just help me scour
the junkyard
for some spare parts.

00:51.124 --> 00:52.124
(GRUNTS) Whoa!

00:54.291 --> 00:55.041
(EXCLAIMING)

01:05.666 --> 01:08.416
You have a fine eye
for machines, my friend.

01:08.416 --> 01:10.000
That beautiful,
mint condition,

01:10.000 --> 01:13.083
restored, classic ion drive
starship can be yours

01:13.083 --> 01:14.915
for only
three million credits.

01:14.915 --> 01:16.915
(RECORD SCRATCHES)

01:16.915 --> 01:18.957
I know you're attached
to our old junker, Groot,

01:18.957 --> 01:21.499
but you know what?
I think it's time
to get a new ship.

01:21.499 --> 01:22.707
Three million credits, huh?

01:22.707 --> 01:24.333
So, how much we got
in the bank?

01:26.957 --> 01:28.915
Huh, we've got
some work to do.

01:28.915 --> 01:29.749
(CHUCKLES) I am Groot.
