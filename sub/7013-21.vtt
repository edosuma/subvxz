00:05.171 --> 00:09.835
I'm telling you, the government has a car
that runs on water, man.

00:09.909 --> 00:13.538
They just don't want us to know,
because then we'd buy all the water.

00:13.613 --> 00:16.172
Then there'd be nothing left
to drink but beer.

00:16.248 --> 00:21.186
And the government knows
that beer... will set us free.

00:23.723 --> 00:26.886
Hyde, you told us about
the car a million times.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.986
Can we please talk about
how hungry and horny I am?

00:31.531 --> 00:34.932
I wish I had a lady
made of pizza.

00:35.001 --> 00:37.993
Or a pizza made of boobs!

00:39.906 --> 00:42.568
Yeah, hungry, check.
Horny, check.

00:42.642 --> 00:45.167
It's getting a little old, Fez.

00:45.245 --> 00:47.941
God, I feel like
I'm Luke Skywalker, you know?

00:48.014 --> 00:51.040
Remember when he was living
on Tatooine before R2 and 3PO showed up?

00:51.117 --> 00:54.883
Just workin' on Uncle Owen's
water farm all day.

00:54.954 --> 00:58.822
Not even allowed to go into Toshie Station
to pick up some power converters.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.622
Boring.

01:01.694 --> 01:05.630
Eric, enough with
the <i>Star Wars</i> crap!

01:05.698 --> 01:07.632
Whenever you talk about
that stuff, I frown.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.759
And when I frown,
my skin wrinkles.

01:09.836 --> 01:11.827
And if I get wrinkles,
my free ride is over.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.102
And I like my free ride!

01:15.175 --> 01:17.803
Yeah, we get it.
You're good looking.

01:17.877 --> 01:20.607
Look, doesn't anybody have
anything new to say?

01:32.358 --> 01:36.089
So there's this car
that runs on water, man.

01:36.162 --> 01:38.392
It runs on water, man!

01:43.570 --> 01:45.504
Okay, Nina,
I brought you the special.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.767
One small soda,
one medium popcorn...

01:47.841 --> 01:50.674
and one large Fez,
dark and sweet.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.207
Fez, you know I've had a lot
of fun hanging out with you.

01:56.282 --> 02:00.150
Hey, 37 times of fun,
to be exact.

02:00.220 --> 02:03.815
It would've been 38, but you know-
And then again, I apologize.

02:05.592 --> 02:08.686
Now enjoy your meal. If you need me,
I'll be smelling your neck.

02:08.761 --> 02:13.562
Fe-Fez, I'm starting to feel
like I need some space.

02:13.633 --> 02:17.034
But I want you to know
it's not you, it's me.

02:17.103 --> 02:22.564
Okay. Well, I guess tonight I'll be doing
number 12,377 of the <i>other</i> thing.

02:26.379 --> 02:28.574
That's sort of gross.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.310
Hey, it may be gross,
but that's the way I learned how to count.

03:14.527 --> 03:18.361
That's like a $20 jumpsuit
and a $4 haircut.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.834
Mmm. Where did
all the money go?

03:24.337 --> 03:28.239
I think we've seen
this episode. Yeah.

03:28.308 --> 03:31.471
And we were sitting in these exact
same seats when we saw it.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.569
Actually, you were sitting
over there.

03:33.646 --> 03:36.114
I remember, 'cause I
could see up your skirt.

03:39.953 --> 03:43.150
You guys, we do the exact
same thing every day.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.714
TV, snack, nap.
It's-

03:45.792 --> 03:49.523
You know what? This isn't a basement.
This is a nursing home.

03:49.596 --> 03:52.394
I know something new we could do.
Jackie, Donna, get naked.

03:54.033 --> 03:56.695
The rest of you guys back off
and give us some room.

04:00.473 --> 04:04.375
- Hello, friends of Fez.
- Hi. Where's Nina?

04:04.444 --> 04:07.277
She don't wanna hang out with me tonight.
She said she needed space.

04:07.347 --> 04:10.544
- [All] Ooh!
- Uh-oh.

04:10.617 --> 04:14.314
That's the same sound you guys made when I
told you I was gonna grow my bangs out.

04:16.656 --> 04:20.615
Fez, when a girl says she needs space,
that means that she's dumping you.

04:20.692 --> 04:22.923
You don't understand.
She said it was her and not me.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.794
- [All] Oh!
- That ain't good.

04:25.865 --> 04:29.323
- Oh, what's the big deal?
- Oh, man, I can't tell him.

04:29.402 --> 04:33.600
This is a job for someone
who's cold, heartless and just inhuman.

04:33.673 --> 04:35.664
Jackie, go for it.

04:37.810 --> 04:42.270
Fez, when a girl says,
"It's not you, it's me"...

04:42.348 --> 04:45.010
what she really means
is it's you.

04:46.252 --> 04:49.244
- So I have really been dumped.
<i>- [Hyde] Yep.</i>

04:49.322 --> 04:52.553
And here's another tip. When a girl says
she just wants to be friends...

04:52.625 --> 04:55.753
it means she wants you to do stuff for her,
but she's not gonna put out.

04:59.732 --> 05:02.895
So, you know,
heads-up on that one.

05:02.969 --> 05:07.201
Yep. Women'll screw you over
every chance they get.

05:07.273 --> 05:10.208
That and breast-feeding.
It just comes natural to 'em.

05:13.513 --> 05:18.348
So, Hadji's girlfriend
finally came to her senses.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.548
What happened? She didn't
wanna be a fifth wife?

05:22.622 --> 05:24.317
[Laughing]

05:24.390 --> 05:26.324
- Hadji.
- All right.

05:26.392 --> 05:29.327
Well, it's her loss.
The girls in my Friday night cribbage game...

05:29.395 --> 05:32.193
will be thrilled
to have Fez back at the table.

05:32.265 --> 05:35.894
You know what?
At least Fez has a social life. Look at us.

05:35.968 --> 05:38.528
We're hanging out
with my parents.

05:38.604 --> 05:43.667
Yeah, about that.
Feel free to get the hell out.

05:44.877 --> 05:48.108
Well, we can do better
than this.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.115
You guys, we're gonna graduate
in two months...

05:50.183 --> 05:52.845
and there is a whole town
out there just waiting for us.

05:52.919 --> 05:56.946
We just have to, you know,
grab the bull by the horns.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.821
Okay, but I tell you this
from experience.

05:59.892 --> 06:04.022
If we're gonna mess with the bull,
we better have an escape plan.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.759
Well, what are the popular kids
doing tonight?

06:11.237 --> 06:14.604
Well, I'll bet they're not hanging around
with their parents...

06:14.674 --> 06:17.609
giving them snarky looks.

06:17.677 --> 06:20.077
I remember when
the Brady kids got bored...

06:20.146 --> 06:24.310
and then that fat kid Oliver showed up.
[Chuckles]

06:24.384 --> 06:28.218
It just all turned around.
They got in a pie fight and everything.

06:28.287 --> 06:32.087
You know what?
Kelso might actually be onto something.

06:32.158 --> 06:34.319
Maybe we should look for
someone new to hang out with.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.989
All right!
We're gettin' a fat kid!

06:41.267 --> 06:43.201
You know, instead
of adding someone...

06:43.269 --> 06:46.238
maybe you should think about
weeding out a few.

06:47.607 --> 06:52.237
Like you and you and... you.

06:55.214 --> 06:58.206
- I'm your son.
- I can't play favorites.

07:01.788 --> 07:05.121
You know, if you're looking for a new friend,
how about Lance Crawford?

07:05.191 --> 07:07.352
He's such a nice boy.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.225
Mom, Lance Crawford and I
hate each other.

07:10.296 --> 07:13.561
You're just obsessed with getting
his mother's peach cobbler recipe.

07:13.633 --> 07:17.592
Well, what kind of a woman
keeps a recipe a secret?

07:17.670 --> 07:21.606
If that recipe were the polio vaccine,
we'd all be in wheelchairs!

07:25.378 --> 07:29.109
I don't like Lance Crawford. He's always
staring at me in this really creepy way.

07:29.182 --> 07:32.345
And this one time,
I saw him fiddling around in my locker.

07:32.418 --> 07:37.754
When I opened it, there was a rose inside,
and my gym socks were missing.

07:37.824 --> 07:41.783
Donna, a little advice.
You're not gonna want those socks back.

07:51.003 --> 07:53.528
I can't think of anyone new
I wanna hang out with.

07:53.606 --> 07:57.337
All the girls I know
are either too snobby or too slutty.

07:57.410 --> 08:01.608
Yeah, I'm not good with the snobs,
but slutty's my bread and butter.

08:01.681 --> 08:07.051
You know, what we need are people
with stuff to offer, like Mark Herman.

08:07.119 --> 08:09.485
He's got that dirt bike.
I always liked him.

08:09.555 --> 08:12.251
- Sold it last week.
- That punk. He's out.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.954
Hey, Carrie Gerber
has a trampoline.

08:16.028 --> 08:18.622
Carrie Gerber also has
a big, hairy mole.

08:18.698 --> 08:21.292
I don't wanna be bouncing around
and get tangled up in that.

08:22.635 --> 08:25.968
<i>Eric. Eric.</i>

08:26.038 --> 08:29.098
Honey, there's someone here
to see you.

08:29.175 --> 08:33.339
Mom, if it's another one of Dad's
Marine Corps recruiters, I'm gonna run away.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.403
I swear.

08:40.052 --> 08:42.145
Lance Crawford? Mom!

08:42.221 --> 08:44.712
Hello, Eric. Your father and I
were just discussing...

08:44.790 --> 08:49.159
how unrealistically space travel
is portrayed in <i>Star Wars.</i>

08:49.228 --> 08:52.254
It was a long time ago,
in a galaxy far, far away.

08:52.331 --> 08:57.496
- You either buy it or you don't.
- What a lively conversation. [Laughing]

08:57.570 --> 09:00.869
- I'll get some sodas.
- No, please. Allow me.

09:00.940 --> 09:05.377
Why don't you stay here and chat with
Mr. Unrealistic Space Travel.

09:05.444 --> 09:07.674
Yes, I'd love to explain
the practical impossibility...

09:07.747 --> 09:10.978
of the so-called light saber.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.780
You son of a bi-

09:18.858 --> 09:21.656
Red alert, you guys. Red alert!
Lance Crawford is in the building!

09:23.329 --> 09:25.661
- I'm gettin' the hell outta here!
- [Jackie] Wait, wait, wait.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.427
- What if he sees us sneaking out?
- Oh, Donna...

09:28.501 --> 09:30.492
leave one of your socks behind.
[Groans]

09:30.570 --> 09:33.061
What? It'll distract him.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.983
Nina, I thought we were so happy together.
What happened?

09:45.051 --> 09:47.246
Fez, right now I'm at
a point in-

09:47.320 --> 09:49.652
Oh, cut the crap, heartbreaker.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.582
I want the truth!

09:53.659 --> 09:56.492
Okay, the truth is
you're too needy.

09:56.562 --> 09:58.860
Too needy?

09:58.931 --> 10:01.559
I'm sorry, but a man
in his sexual prime has needs.

10:02.969 --> 10:06.336
And you are lucky to have such
a stallion at your disposal.

10:07.406 --> 10:09.465
No, your <i>needs</i> are fine.

10:09.542 --> 10:12.272
It's your <i>neediness</i>
that's the problem.

10:12.345 --> 10:16.975
- Then why didn't you say that?
- I didn't want you to make a scene.

10:17.049 --> 10:20.075
You didn't want me
to make a scene?

10:22.722 --> 10:25.452
You didn't want me
to make a scene?

10:29.028 --> 10:30.962
Ha!

10:31.030 --> 10:34.522
You dump Fez! I dump fries!
There's your scene!

10:35.835 --> 10:37.962
Here's a dollar.
Sorry about the scene.

10:46.225 --> 10:50.491
Oh, poor Fez.
Too depressed to leave his room.

10:50.562 --> 10:53.224
- That's it. You guys, we gotta cheer him up.
- Knock first.

10:53.298 --> 10:56.290
If Fez is alone,
I'm guessing he's not wearing pants.

10:57.503 --> 11:01.200
Oh, awesome!
Wait. Let's catch him.

11:07.913 --> 11:11.349
- Oh, wow.
- Wow!

11:11.416 --> 11:14.442
Check out all this great stuff.

11:15.487 --> 11:17.421
Oh, my God.
Is that a race-car bed?

11:17.489 --> 11:20.287
- I call shotgun!
- Ay!

11:20.359 --> 11:23.385
Oh! Fezzie, come on out.

11:23.462 --> 11:26.431
I can't.
I'm not wearing pants.

11:26.498 --> 11:28.489
Told you!

11:31.136 --> 11:34.401
Nina told me why she dumped me.
She said I was too needy.

11:34.473 --> 11:37.442
Am I too needy?
Tell me! I need to know!

11:37.509 --> 11:40.603
Fez, I'm sorry, man.

11:40.679 --> 11:42.738
You're the definition
of needy.

11:42.814 --> 11:45.044
Remember, one time,
you called me at 3:00 in the morning...

11:45.117 --> 11:47.278
just to make sure
we were still friends?

11:48.887 --> 11:51.549
Look, if you wanna get Nina back,
you gotta act like you don't care.

11:51.623 --> 11:55.559
- But I don't know how to do that.
- Well, we can help you.

11:55.627 --> 11:59.290
Oh! We'll rebuild you
like the Six Million Dollar Man!

12:03.602 --> 12:05.797
Fez One to Control.
We have liftoff.

12:05.871 --> 12:08.271
All systems are go.

12:08.340 --> 12:10.865
Proceed to eat candy.

12:12.244 --> 12:15.111
<i>- [Klaxon Blaring]</i>
- Uh-oh. Emergency! Emergency!

12:15.180 --> 12:19.014

12:44.943 --> 12:47.002
"Aloofer"?
Is that even a word?

We can make it one.
We have the technology.

12:52.084 --> 12:55.178
[Scoffs]

12:59.458 --> 13:02.859
- Initiate female reaction sequence.
- Release the girls.

13:07.065 --> 13:09.533
Hey, Fez, looking good.

13:11.136 --> 13:14.936
Love the outfit.
Totally bionic.

13:15.007 --> 13:17.999
You mean nothing to me.

13:18.076 --> 13:20.010
Oh, no.

13:20.078 --> 13:22.012
He's no longer needy.

13:22.080 --> 13:25.538
And because of that,
I want him even more.

13:31.790 --> 13:36.284
[All]
Doctor. Doctor. Doctor.

13:36.361 --> 13:39.728
- Terrific job.
- [All] Doctor. Doctor. Doctor.

13:39.798 --> 13:41.891
- Whoa. Doctor.
- Whoa.

13:41.967 --> 13:43.901
Doctor.

13:43.969 --> 13:45.960
Oh, I see.
In order to get Nina...

13:46.038 --> 13:48.666
I have to act
like I don't need her.

13:48.740 --> 13:51.334
Well, fine.
I don't need Nina.

13:51.410 --> 13:53.344
I don't need women.

13:53.412 --> 13:56.745
- I don't need anything!
- [All] Oh!

14:02.321 --> 14:05.449
Eric sure is taking an awfully long time
with those sodas.

14:05.524 --> 14:06.889
[Laughing]

14:06.958 --> 14:09.085
I'm sure it's no reflection
on you, Lance.

14:09.161 --> 14:12.221
He probably just wants to make sure
a good friend like you...

14:12.297 --> 14:16.358
gets the freshest soda
available.

14:16.435 --> 14:18.767
I know Eric doesn't like me,
Mrs. Forman.

14:18.837 --> 14:22.967
I only came over for the chance
to see my beautiful Donna.

14:23.041 --> 14:25.032
And after I make
my fortune in robots...

14:25.110 --> 14:28.671
I'm gonna come back to this Podunk town and
buy whatever flour mill Eric is working at...

14:28.747 --> 14:31.739
fire him,
and make Donna my wife.

14:31.817 --> 14:34.308
You're a creepy kid.
You know that?

14:36.755 --> 14:39.918
Mrs. Forman, I think we both know
the real reason you invited me over here.

14:39.991 --> 14:42.551
You're after Mother's coveted
peach cobbler recipe, no?

14:42.627 --> 14:47.496
Your mom makes peach cobbler?
I had no idea.

14:48.667 --> 14:51.261
Please, let's speak frankly.

14:51.336 --> 14:54.328
I have something you want,
and you have something I want.

14:54.406 --> 14:59.173
W-We're not in a- in a position
to just give you Donna.

15:00.178 --> 15:02.703
We could give you Eric.

15:05.717 --> 15:08.345
Mother tasted your stuffing
at the Thanksgiving Turkey Trot...

15:08.420 --> 15:10.354
and ever since then
she's wanted the recipe.

15:10.422 --> 15:12.549
I've been instructed
to arrange a swap.

15:14.359 --> 15:17.658
Don't you have any weird friends
to play with?

15:17.729 --> 15:20.163
Friends are for the weak.

15:28.173 --> 15:30.607
Okay, you guys.
MeetJulie.

15:30.675 --> 15:32.939
She's got two horses,
a brand-new Firebird...

15:33.011 --> 15:37.277
<i>and</i> her dad works
for Six Flags!

15:37.349 --> 15:40.750
[All]
Hello, Julie!

15:40.819 --> 15:43.720
Hey, Hyde.
Love your hair.

15:43.789 --> 15:47.088
You can touch it if you want.

15:47.159 --> 15:49.491
Oh, get lost, skankoid.
We're all full.

15:51.663 --> 15:56.430
Damn, Jackie!
She's got a Firebird and two horses!

15:56.501 --> 15:58.594
We could've raced 'em!

16:00.272 --> 16:02.797
All right. That's it.
I'm gonna go askJake Bradley.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.900
I know. We've all been thinking it,
but no one's had the guts to ask him...

16:05.977 --> 16:08.411
'cause he's the quarterback,
and we're a bunch of jelly heads.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.744
But you know what I say?
I say we shoot for the stars.

16:10.816 --> 16:14.013
And that star is Jake Bradley!
Jake Bradley!

16:20.792 --> 16:24.558
All right, Fez. There's Nina.
Now remember, you're a new man.

16:24.629 --> 16:26.654
You don't need her
or anything else.

16:26.731 --> 16:32.294
- Got it. I am cooler, suaver, aloofer.
- There you go.

16:37.342 --> 16:40.573
- Oh, hi, Fez.
- Oh, you wish, baby.

16:42.247 --> 16:45.273
Why don't you take your "Hi, Fez" act
and try it on someone else?

16:45.350 --> 16:47.978
'Cause I don't need it.

16:51.389 --> 16:54.449
- Nice work, Fez.
- Shut up. I don't need your accolades.

16:56.995 --> 16:59.486
How can you give away
your stuffing recipe, Kitty?

16:59.564 --> 17:03.660
It's the one thing that we have
that's better than everyone else's.

17:06.137 --> 17:08.127
Our house? Crappier.

17:09.406 --> 17:11.397
Our son? Crappier.

17:12.810 --> 17:15.439
Our stuffing? Better!

17:16.580 --> 17:18.515
[Groans]

17:19.818 --> 17:22.048
Okay, Lance.
Here you go.

17:26.657 --> 17:29.456
Excellent.
Mother will be most pleased.

17:29.528 --> 17:32.224
Oh, you be sure to say hi.
Such a nice lady.

17:32.297 --> 17:35.289
Please, Mrs. Forman,
there's no need to keep up the charade.

17:36.301 --> 17:38.929
Fine. She's cold.
Get out.

17:41.573 --> 17:45.373
I just want you to know
that I don't <i>need</i> these fries.

17:47.512 --> 17:52.347
I choose to eat them
because I desire their salty taste.

17:53.418 --> 17:56.581
Please, just take the fries.

17:56.655 --> 18:01.957
You <i>need</i> me to take them,
don't you? Needy bastard.

18:04.963 --> 18:06.897
Hi, Fez.
Can I talk to you?

18:06.965 --> 18:11.334
Oh, you <i>need</i> permission,
do you?

18:11.403 --> 18:14.304
I think I was a little too hasty
breaking up with you.

18:14.372 --> 18:19.332
- Really?
- Yes. I like the new Fez.

18:19.411 --> 18:22.676
- What about the old Fez?
- Not so much.

18:23.748 --> 18:25.682
You know what, Nina?

18:25.750 --> 18:27.741
There's only one Fez...

18:27.819 --> 18:29.810
and that is a Fez with needs.

18:31.823 --> 18:34.121
And if you don't like that,
then we shouldn't be together.

18:34.192 --> 18:36.183
- But, Fez, I-
- Shh!

18:40.599 --> 18:43.295
Sorry, baby.
It's over.

18:43.368 --> 18:47.862
Oh, and, Nina, it's not me,
it's you.

18:53.945 --> 18:57.039
Ladies ofThe Hub...

18:57.115 --> 18:59.379
why do we try to act
like we have no needs?

18:59.451 --> 19:01.385
I have needs.

19:01.453 --> 19:04.354
For instance, I need a date
for Saturday night. Any takers?

19:04.422 --> 19:09.792
You, blondie.
You there, with the glasses.

19:09.861 --> 19:12.796
What about the redhead
trying to cover her face?

19:16.267 --> 19:19.862
12,378, here I come.

19:28.947 --> 19:31.643
Hey. So I went to see
Jake Bradley-

19:31.716 --> 19:34.844
You mean- [Imitating Eric]
Jake Bradley?

19:39.424 --> 19:42.723
Yes. To see if he
wanted to hang out.

19:42.794 --> 19:45.058
And you know what
Mr. Cool Guy was doing?

19:45.130 --> 19:47.621
Just hanging out in his basement
with his friends...

19:47.699 --> 19:51.897
and they were watching
<i>The Six Million Dollar Man.</i>

19:53.004 --> 19:55.131
It was eerie.

19:55.206 --> 19:57.470
Was there a skinny guy
dating this really hot chick...

19:57.542 --> 19:59.669
who's way out of his league?

20:01.813 --> 20:04.941
You know, there was.

20:05.016 --> 20:09.578
Wait. Does this mean
we're not gettin' a fat kid to play with?

20:11.056 --> 20:13.422
No, man.
We don't need anyone else.

20:13.491 --> 20:16.289
You know what? We've only got
two months until graduation...

20:16.361 --> 20:18.295
and we can't waste
a second of that.

20:18.363 --> 20:21.196
Forman's right.
Let's seize the day, man.

20:25.036 --> 20:28.199
Hey, weren't we supposed
to seize something, man?

20:29.841 --> 20:32.810
You know what
the Six Million Dollar Man should have?

20:32.877 --> 20:35.038
A bionic nose.

20:35.113 --> 20:37.240
You could smell everything!

20:38.683 --> 20:41.618
Guys, all I know is that we
should really appreciate this...

20:41.686 --> 20:45.486
'cause I don't think we're gonna be able
to do this in college.

20:47.158 --> 20:51.185
This peach cobbler is amazing!

20:51.262 --> 20:55.289
Now, who would leave a whole pan
of peach cobbler just sitting on a counter?

20:56.935 --> 20:59.733
See? We don't need anyone else.

20:59.804 --> 21:03.672
We have lots of interesting
things to say. Right?

21:05.610 --> 21:08.738
Hey, there's this car
that runs on water.

21:09.748 --> 21:12.080
It runs on water, man!

21:21.192 --> 21:24.559
- [Laughing]
- [Imitating Engine Revving]

21:24.629 --> 21:27.996
Careful. I know it looks like a race car,
but it's really a bed.

21:28.066 --> 21:30.694
Please don't make a mess.
The maid doesn't come until Thursday.

21:30.769 --> 21:35.502
Watch it! That is a present
from my cousin in Hong Kong.

21:35.573 --> 21:38.474
Who has been dropping
Milk Duds on my carpet?

21:38.543 --> 21:41.535
Who has been dropping
Milk Duds on my carpet?

21:44.382 --> 21:46.714
Screw this.
I'm going to Eric's.
