Bart, this isn't the kind of thing
I normally would think was a good idea,

05:31.289 --> 05:33.416
but you wouldn't have
to live with Mr. Burns.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.751

07:06.092 --> 07:08.094
There sure is.

07:08.177 --> 07:11.264
Kids, you tried your best,
and you failed miserably.

07:11.347 --> 07:14.642

07:14.725 --> 07:17.603

08:42.605 --> 08:46.025
Bart, get over to the mansion
and open up all the windows.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.736
We want to get the old-people
smell out before we move in.

Now that you've all agreed
to reap the windfall of my death,

09:08.714 --> 09:11.467
I must return to my large,
empty mansion

09:11.551 --> 09:15.930
to rattle around and await
the inevitable alone.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.268
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

09:20.351 --> 09:22.770
Yeah. Let's push him
down the steps.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.480
No!

09:24.564 --> 09:27.650
You know, Bart, since he is
giving you all of his money,

09:27.733 --> 09:30.611
maybe it would be nice
if you spent some time with him.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.905
-Well--
-Come on, honey.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.699

09:34.782 --> 09:36.492

the greatest time.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.071
Mr. Burns's house
has everything:

11:37.154 --> 11:39.031
a hedge maze, a moat,

11:39.115 --> 11:41.033
bleached hardwood floors
and a bottomless pit.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.827
It couldn't possibly
be bottomless.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.245
Well, for all intents
and purposes.

11:47.081 --> 11:50.751
Hey! Mom!
Bart's throwing peas!

11:50.835 --> 11:52.420
Bart, don't throw peas
at your sister.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.714
Mr. Burns throws peas
at Smithers.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.133
Ow! That was a big one!

11:57.216 --> 12:00.010
-Homer, say something.
-Okay.

12:00.094 --> 12:03.681
Lisa, quit getting in the way
of your wealthy brother's peas.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.559
-(groans)
-Oh, yuck. Meat loaf.

12:06.642 --> 12:09.937
My most hated of all loafs.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.440
(gasps)
That was the end piece!

12:12.523 --> 12:16.068
That's it! Being abusive
to your family is one thing,

12:16.152 --> 12:19.280
but I will not stand idly by
and watch you feed a hungry dog!

12:19.363 --> 12:22.742
-Go to your room!
-No! This family stinks!

12:22.825 --> 12:25.035
Mr. Burns nurtures
my destructive side.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.620
I'm suffocating here.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.707
-Bart, you listen!
-Oh, go eat some flowers!

12:29.790 --> 12:31.834
(screams)
My secret shame.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.716
Smithers, my plan
worked perfectly.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.093
Bart Simpson will
live here as my son,

12:41.177 --> 12:43.929
and I will mold him
in my own graven image.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.724

I may even grow to...

12:46.807 --> 12:47.767

Bartholomew!

12:50.060 --> 12:52.521
Ugh! Smithers,
get it off me!

12:55.775 --> 12:57.276
Bart, you're coming home.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.111
I want to stay here
with Mr. Burns.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.113
I suggest you leave
immediately.

13:01.197 --> 13:04.116
Or what? You'll release
the dogs or the bees,

13:04.200 --> 13:06.118
or dogs with bees
in their mouth,

13:06.202 --> 13:08.245
and when they bark,
they shoot bees at you?

13:08.329 --> 13:10.998
Well, go ahead.
Do your worst.

Mr. And Mrs. Simpson,

15:39.605 --> 15:41.815
your son has clearly
been brainwashed

15:41.899 --> 15:44.193
by the evil
and charismatic Mr. Burns.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.487
Are you sure you can
get him back for us?

15:46.570 --> 15:48.739
Absolutely.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.116
I'm the one who successfully
deprogrammed Jane Fonda, you know.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.743
What about Peter Fonda?

15:52.826 --> 15:54.745
Oh, that was a heartbreaker.

15:54.828 --> 15:57.539
But I did get Paul McCartney
out of Wings.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.542
You idiot! He was

Well, it was a grueling
two weeks,

16:27.236 --> 16:29.530
Ooh.
