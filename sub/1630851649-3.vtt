WEBVTT

00:04.080 --> 00:05.320
Whisky and soda.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.960
MUSIC: Lonely This Christmas
by Mud

00:10.360 --> 00:11.679
I'll get that.

00:11.680 --> 00:12.880
No, you won't.

00:23.560 --> 00:24.800
Sorry.

00:26.240 --> 00:27.959
What for?

00:27.960 --> 00:30.759
I'm guessing it was a man.

00:30.760 --> 00:34.119
If he won't say sorry,
then I'll say it for him.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.719
That doesn't help.

00:35.720 --> 00:36.840
No.

00:37.840 --> 00:38.880
No.

00:44.600 --> 00:45.920
I'm Albert.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.599
Always the same, this time of year.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.239
It's when the
memories come in.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.399
The regrets.

00:54.400 --> 00:57.959
It's when weak men get weaker.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.480
Aye, it is.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.359
Let me get you
another one.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.319
Come on, it's Christmas, eh?

01:07.320 --> 01:08.880
Not yet, it's no'.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.600
Ten minutes.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.160
I don't want a drink.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.040
I want revenge.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.240
But maybe that could
start with a drink.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.200
Er, not here.

01:31.360 --> 01:35.039
# I'll be cold, so cold

01:35.040 --> 01:39.039
# Without you to hold

01:39.040 --> 01:43.160
# This Christmas. #

01:48.280 --> 01:49.680
# Ah

01:52.760 --> 01:55.880
# Now, I don't hardly know her

01:59.080 --> 02:02.280
# But I think I could love her

02:04.960 --> 02:08.040
# Crimson and clover

02:11.200 --> 02:13.480
# I

02:16.320 --> 02:18.240
# Wish she'd come walking over

02:22.600 --> 02:26.080
# Now, I've been waiting to show her

02:28.680 --> 02:31.000
# Crimson and clover... #

02:39.280 --> 02:41.320
That wasn't part of my plan.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.000
I'm not...

02:47.000 --> 02:51.400
It was booze and loneliness,
and I don't want to talk about it.

02:52.720 --> 02:56.039
What I want to talk about is the
land.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.240
What about it?

02:59.920 --> 03:02.399
It's a bit of a departure
for him, is it not?

03:02.400 --> 03:04.759
I...I suspect that's the point.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.079
He wants a legacy to be proud of.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.800
Well, he's not getting it.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.640
And if that wasn't your plan...

03:13.200 --> 03:14.400
..then what is?

03:16.280 --> 03:18.079
CHATTER

03:18.080 --> 03:19.840
..but I'll leave that up to you.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.600
Thanks for seeing me.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.480
Why am I seeing you?

03:40.160 --> 03:45.119
Ah, I couldn't understand
you going legit.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.959
Erm...

03:46.960 --> 03:51.560
I couldn't see the motivation,
but now I can.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.040
And I'm impressed by you.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.080
By Phoenix.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.999
Why didn't you ask me to help you?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.599
Why didn't you tell me to help you?

04:05.600 --> 04:07.119
Because it's honest.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.599
HE INHALES

04:09.600 --> 04:11.040
It's too honest.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.359
They're too professional,
too precise.

04:15.360 --> 04:19.560
There's no imagination, no artistry.

04:20.720 --> 04:24.040
When they try and muddy the
waters...

04:25.200 --> 04:28.039
..I can see through it without
trying.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.640
What if the council do the same?

04:30.880 --> 04:31.920
The press.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.279
You can't be Phoenix.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.240
Not in public, not in the city.

04:38.440 --> 04:42.599
You cannot, surely to God,
be working your way to a threat?

04:42.600 --> 04:46.120
I'm just saying that they
can't give you what you need.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.079
The protection.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.759
Subterfuge.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.880
What is it with you, Max?
You're a moth to a flame.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.160
You know, Kenny.

05:00.280 --> 05:01.520
You've seen our office.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.680
I can't begin to tell you the...

05:06.280 --> 05:08.920
..detritus that walks
through that door.

05:10.280 --> 05:11.400
It's not me.

05:12.720 --> 05:13.800
It can't be me.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.800
Let me work for you, full-time, on
Phoenix...

05:20.080 --> 05:22.200
..and I can keep you invisible.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.039
What about your partner?

05:26.040 --> 05:27.240
Fuck him.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.360
Thank you for your concern.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.840
Safe journey down the road.

05:39.320 --> 05:40.520
I saw Dad here.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.000
I know.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.280
I'm leaving Edinburgh.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.319
We're not young, your father and I.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.359
I'm not young either.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.999
I'm running out of time to find
another life.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.800
You could find one right here.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.719
The new development down at Leith.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.800
Your father and I own the land.

06:10.880 --> 06:15.079
We hoped it could bring us together
as a family. That's why he was here.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.559
You and him?

06:16.560 --> 06:18.559
Only recently, only with this...

06:18.560 --> 06:21.279
You could build any life...
How could you?

06:21.280 --> 06:24.960
Because I didn't want to die without
trying to bring us back together.

06:26.680 --> 06:30.760
Look... You think it was a choice...

06:31.880 --> 06:35.320
..the life your father's led,
but it wasn't.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.759
He wanted to give us a good life.

06:39.760 --> 06:43.760
From where he came from,
he took the only road he could.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.959
He spent decades working
towards this,

06:47.960 --> 06:50.400
working towards something to be
proud of.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.440
For you to be proud of.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.560
If I can sit in that thing
and forgive him...

07:01.040 --> 07:02.280
..then so can you.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.880
I want my own lawyer.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.519
Then I'll know if it's
something to be proud of.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.719
OK.

07:10.720 --> 07:13.439
And not someone who works for Dad,
not someone who owes him a favour.

07:13.440 --> 07:16.559
I understand that,
but it's sensitive.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.359
There are lots of people in this
city who wouldn't want to see

07:19.360 --> 07:21.479
your father have this opportunity.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.839
Well, that's the only way
I'll do it.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.280
Then I'll find you a lawyer.

07:27.040 --> 07:30.080
I'm not asking you to trust him.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.920
I'm asking you to trust me.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.919
I was thinking that later,
if you can handle Pilton,

07:42.920 --> 07:44.879
I could attempt a wee bit of dinner.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.039
It's Pilton borders, really.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.279
Er...

07:48.280 --> 07:49.679
Can I let you know?

07:49.680 --> 07:52.039
It depends on work.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.360
Y-yeah, of course.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.399
Hi. She wants her own lawyer.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.799
I'll give her one of this lot.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.560
No, her hackles are up.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.999
She wants someone independent
and she'll check that they are.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.799
We can't. We have to.
She's talking about leaving.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.959
I had to work to get her to this.

08:10.960 --> 08:12.519
We can't bring in an outsider.

08:12.520 --> 08:15.479
We need someone who looks
like an outsider,

08:15.480 --> 08:18.000
who looks clean and who is neither.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.719
I've just heard Max McCall in.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.879
Now there's a man in
search of something.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.199
He came out awful early.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.680
I'm checking that.

08:31.480 --> 08:35.160
If we use him, we'll need to call
in the insurance.

08:37.360 --> 08:41.679
You were always ambitious
about the three of us.

08:41.680 --> 08:43.679
About how it might end.

08:43.680 --> 08:45.039
I'm right.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.240
I hope so.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.040
Jackie Thompson.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.160
Heads up undercover. Right.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.879
What do you know about her?

08:59.880 --> 09:01.440
I know what she does.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.679
I'm working with her.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.799
OK. I can't tell you too much about
it.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.839
I'd imagine not. But as part of our
investigation, I need to pull a file

09:10.840 --> 09:13.880
without a record of having done so,
so I'd like you to do that.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.360
What's the name?

09:19.480 --> 09:23.799
Max McCall. Bent lawyer.
He's just got out.

09:23.800 --> 09:27.479
There will be a note in the file
about ongoing cooperation.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.559
Take that out and give the file
to Stevie.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.679
Your operations, in terms of
protocol, do you have any...

09:33.680 --> 09:35.319
Carte blanche.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.639
He served two years of a seven-year
sentence.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.079
Hence the note.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.320
Take it out and give him the file.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.079
There's something else.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.439
Your live address near Leith Walk?

09:47.440 --> 09:49.479
I know someone who works there.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.599
Kenny from the place I go.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.679
That could be a useful relationship.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.879
It is a useful relationship.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.719
Don't worry, it's his partner
I'm interested in.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.199
Who's his partner?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.440
Max McCall.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.320
Does Kenny know that you do this?

10:08.680 --> 10:10.159
Thanks for your help.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.639
No. You're exposed.

10:11.640 --> 10:14.479
No, Stevie is digging his
grave and I want to help him.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.519
That's not enough.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.200
I-if Kenny is clean
and I'm careful...

10:22.600 --> 10:24.439
..he could be useful.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.160
You'd work Kenny? If needed.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.319
Stevie's working for Roy Lynch.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.320
Max used to. Kenny, I don't know.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.920
Do you want to help me get Roy Lynch
and take down Stevie along the way?

10:43.080 --> 10:44.919
Very much so.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.240
Then work Kenny.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.319
They're misty, those years.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.839
Always will be.

10:56.840 --> 11:00.599
But every so often, the mist clears,
gives you a wee peek at something.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.319
It's never good, right enough.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.759
So it took a while for the card
to come through the mist.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.039
What card?

11:07.040 --> 11:09.679
You see, sometimes when I was
particularly drunk, I'd go to the

11:09.680 --> 11:11.799
casino on Rose Street for a late
drink.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.000
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
This casino.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.120
And there he is - Teddy's brother.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.519
What have you done?

11:41.520 --> 11:43.039
I looked into it.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.199
The old investigatory.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.959
It's a button I can't turn off.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.479
Jesus Christ. Just a quiet peek.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.599
I know the security guy,
threw me out a few times.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.519
He's not a bad lad... Is this a bag?

11:53.520 --> 11:56.319
Yeah. I don't know who that one
is yet,

11:56.320 --> 11:57.719
but here's what I think happened...

11:57.720 --> 11:59.359
No.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.319
Max? No, Kenny.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.999
We don't want to know anything
about Terry's brother or what that

12:05.000 --> 12:07.519
bag's doing there or how we fit into
this.

12:07.520 --> 12:10.240
If we don't know,
if we don't lie to him...

12:11.960 --> 12:13.519
..then maybe we get out of this.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.519
We need to know what we're dealing
with.

12:15.520 --> 12:21.799
I saw Teddy put four men in hospital
because they disagreed with him

12:21.800 --> 12:25.159
over the lyrics to My Boy Lollipop.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.239
They were his friends.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.759
And they were right about the
lyrics.

12:29.760 --> 12:32.600
Though I suspect that wasn't of any
consolation.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.360
He was my cellmate.

12:37.680 --> 12:42.199
He slept above my head and
I lay there in the dark,

12:42.200 --> 12:44.839
listening to him breathe,

12:44.840 --> 12:47.639
and it felt like I was in a grave

12:47.640 --> 12:50.480
and he was standing watch upon me.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.440
That's who we're dealing with.

12:54.720 --> 12:59.079
So we tell him we found
nothing and we move on, OK?

12:59.080 --> 13:00.479
Fucking right!

13:00.480 --> 13:01.520
DOOR OPENS

13:03.160 --> 13:04.200
Do you dae divorces?

13:05.720 --> 13:06.920
Absolutely!

13:17.040 --> 13:20.439
Max is clean. There's no record
of cooperation in his file.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.840
He got out early.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.080
He's a lawyer.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.199
Zinc.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.519
That was her excuse.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.679
She said there was a problem at the
water treatment plant in Niddrie,

13:33.680 --> 13:35.479
so they put zinc in the tap water

13:35.480 --> 13:37.639
and that played havoc with...

13:37.640 --> 13:38.959
..men's equipment.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.639
So she reckons it was the zinc
that reversed my vasectomy

13:41.640 --> 13:44.839
and brought about the wee man,
Nathaniel.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.319
But now there are a few cracks
in her story.

13:47.320 --> 13:50.279
Cracks? Aye, cos I spoke to my GP
and he says there's nae way,

13:50.280 --> 13:52.319
there's nae way that zinc could have
done that.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.479
Well, he knows his stuff.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.479
I confronted her during the
commercials on You've Been Framed!

13:56.480 --> 13:59.599
She says she wants a divorce,
so I'm going to call her bluff

13:59.600 --> 14:01.759
by giving her one.

14:01.760 --> 14:05.319
That sounds like a dignified way out.

14:05.320 --> 14:08.359
Well, I'll draw up the papers
if you give me a few days.

14:08.360 --> 14:09.719
Cheers, pal.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.999
This is a huge weight off my
shoulders.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.840
Let's hope that's not too fleeting
an experience for you.

14:25.840 --> 14:29.559
Hello? When you say Hilton
borders...

14:29.560 --> 14:31.999
It's Pilton, you need to know
that.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.240
You need to steal yourself
and check your travel insurance.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.319
I think I can handle it.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.240
So do I. See you tonight?

14:42.880 --> 14:44.480
See you tonight.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.440
That was the Yvonne.

14:57.080 --> 15:02.799
She's...well, we've got
a wee thing going, I suppose.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.799
Where does a man like you meet
a woman?

15:04.800 --> 15:08.479
She's a fellow traveller
on the road to clarity.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.599
You met her there? I did.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.080
The mind boggles.

15:15.080 --> 15:20.399
Obviously, this place,
what we do as entirely confidential.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.439
PHONE BUZZES

15:22.440 --> 15:26.599
Of course. This is just you and me,
Kenny.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.040
Leith's finest.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.680
Yeah? I require a little subterfuge.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.840
I had a tough night with Papillon
last night.

16:22.520 --> 16:27.080
He was trying to get to Colombia
from Trinidad...by raft.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.759
That sounds difficult.

16:30.760 --> 16:33.000
It's a thousand nautical miles.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.240
It's a wee bit more than difficult.

16:39.040 --> 16:43.679
You've actually just missed Max,
he's... Two months he was at it.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.080
Lost his oars in a storm.

16:47.360 --> 16:52.039
Used his hands as paddles
till the salt cut them to ribbons,

16:52.040 --> 16:55.080
so he took off his shirt
and made a sail.

16:56.600 --> 17:00.199
And there was just about enough
wind to keep on moving.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.480
And there he is...

17:02.720 --> 17:05.440
..two months in, thin as a rake...

17:07.080 --> 17:10.680
..hands cut to ribbons,
half dead from dehydration.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.880
Then he looks up and he sees it.

17:16.360 --> 17:17.760
Colombia.

17:20.520 --> 17:21.880
And right then...

17:24.760 --> 17:25.800
..right then...

17:27.640 --> 17:29.240
..the wind turns on him.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.000
Fucking...

17:35.040 --> 17:36.720
..turns on him.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.160
And Papillon drifts away,
like a feather in the wind.

17:43.600 --> 17:47.240
And I was up half the night thinking
what that must have done to him...

17:48.400 --> 17:49.760
..to watch Colombia...

17:51.400 --> 17:53.520
..slip away over the waves.

17:58.480 --> 18:01.080
I've actually got to head out.
Betrayal...

18:02.360 --> 18:06.520
..that's what it must have felt
like - between him and the wind.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.080
Betrayal.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.480
The sin of omission.

18:26.920 --> 18:31.279
The judge said that in my trial,
he was talking about a set of
skeleton keys

18:31.280 --> 18:36.759
I had hidden in my tumble dryer,
but I think it works here, too.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.439
Well, we're still working out...

18:38.440 --> 18:40.200
Do you know what I never get?

18:41.200 --> 18:42.560
Silence.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.680
It's busy up here...

18:47.240 --> 18:48.440
..always has been.

18:49.840 --> 18:54.400
Voices, opinions, a cacophony.

18:56.840 --> 18:59.680
Max told me that one - a cacophony.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.239
Am I saying that right? Spot on.

19:04.240 --> 19:10.480
And, right now, that lot are ganging
up on you and Maxie.

19:11.960 --> 19:15.760
If you can fit us in tomorrow...
Where's the casino?

19:17.800 --> 19:19.200
No idea.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.839
Here they are again.

19:22.840 --> 19:25.039
Rose Street, next to Pizza Hut.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.799
Parking's a nightmare.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.800
Just stick it in George Street and
cut through the lane.

19:33.560 --> 19:37.799
You tell Maxie what's inside me.
That's a guarantee.

19:37.800 --> 19:41.919
And I'm worried
that this time, when it takes over,

19:41.920 --> 19:43.760
it's never going to stop.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.519
Coriander...

20:07.520 --> 20:09.640
BUZZER RINGS

20:27.760 --> 20:29.400
I remember this floor.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.160
The blood...

20:33.800 --> 20:35.239
..and the anger.

20:35.240 --> 20:39.399
Does it help? You knew what you are
doing, get me drunk like that,

20:39.400 --> 20:44.039
dripping your poison into my ear,
bringing me here all coiled

20:44.040 --> 20:45.679
up and ready to go.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.679
It wasn't the plan.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.000
No, it wasn't.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.000
And, no...

20:55.840 --> 20:57.040
..it doesn't help.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.359
This is going to be a disaster.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.840
Don't worry about it.

21:10.120 --> 21:13.520
Would you like a...? Hmm.
It's only temporary. Hmm.

21:15.240 --> 21:18.479
Grew up in the worse place in this.

21:18.480 --> 21:21.119
How did you end up in Edinburgh?

21:21.120 --> 21:24.639
My ex was Scottish. Huh. He
persuaded me to move to Edinburgh,

21:24.640 --> 21:27.000
and things collapsed nicely from
there. Hmm.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.199
How's work? Fine.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.719
You? Well, today we had the guy
who reckons his barren testicles

21:34.720 --> 21:37.079
have been reawakened by
the water supply.

21:37.080 --> 21:41.800
But, other than that, it's mostly
wills. Who is we? Max, my partner.

21:43.920 --> 21:47.399
He's an investigator?
A lawyer, a proper one.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.479
He runs the practice.

21:48.480 --> 21:49.879
I work the punters.

21:49.880 --> 21:51.639
You must trust him.

21:51.640 --> 21:55.040
Aye, more or less. He cuts a few
corners, right enough.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.959
That's probably not appropriate.

21:57.960 --> 22:01.079
I'm not here is that.
I should hope not.

22:01.080 --> 22:02.919
Right...

22:02.920 --> 22:04.320
Please. Thank you.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.920
OK, let's give it a go.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.519
Aw, for fuck...

22:15.520 --> 22:17.359
Congratulations.

22:17.360 --> 22:21.199
As of tomorrow,
the land's all yours.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.280
And you get your cut.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.640
Don't look like that.

22:26.840 --> 22:30.000
I like you getting a cut - helps me
understand you.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.160
A little, anyway.

22:37.080 --> 22:40.720
How did it come
to this between you and them?

22:43.880 --> 22:45.200
When I was 16...

22:46.560 --> 22:50.599
..my mum let me have a drink
on Christmas Eve.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.759
It didn't agree with me,
so I went downstairs in the middle

22:53.760 --> 22:57.079
of the night and I saw my mum
washing blood

22:57.080 --> 22:59.560
off my dad's hands at the sink.

23:01.040 --> 23:04.319
They looked to me, she said
something about an accident,

23:04.320 --> 23:06.920
but I was looking at dad -
the guilt in his face.

23:11.040 --> 23:15.160
He looked like a child. And you
didn't know what he'd done?

23:16.240 --> 23:17.559
Kids said things,

23:17.560 --> 23:20.599
the brave ones, but I just
ignored them.

23:20.600 --> 23:24.639
Maybe I would have ignored
that night too, but...

23:24.640 --> 23:28.360
..a few days later, Dad's car
was forced off the road.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.160
Mum was driving...

23:32.200 --> 23:34.559
..she hasn't walked so well since,

23:34.560 --> 23:36.840
so it wasn't hard to join the dots.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.239
I told them I was going to call
the police -

23:41.240 --> 23:43.919
Mum persuaded me not to.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.279
She said Dad was leaving.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.800
It was just going to be me and her.

23:50.120 --> 23:55.560
And the police were already
after Dad - some woman - so...

23:59.000 --> 24:01.759
I didn't call the police.

24:01.760 --> 24:05.279
And it's just been me and her
until...

24:05.280 --> 24:06.720
..till all this.

24:08.560 --> 24:12.879
That's why I want to take
it from him - his legacy...

24:12.880 --> 24:16.400
..stolen from beneath his feet
by his own daughter.

24:18.880 --> 24:20.720
That's how it got to this.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.160
And to you.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.160
I know you paid a price...

25:21.520 --> 25:24.999
..but so did I, so did Maggie.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.680
You didn't pay a price.

25:27.680 --> 25:29.440
You got what you wanted.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.639
Didn't even have the guts
to do it yourself.

25:33.640 --> 25:37.560
I cleaned up and now I'm cleaning
up again.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.120
This place will be a park...

25:45.400 --> 25:49.039
..because a park doesn't require
foundations.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.520
You don't dig down into the soil...

25:53.760 --> 25:55.160
..into the secrets.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.440
And it will be a place of joy.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.960
Of children, happy children...

26:05.560 --> 26:07.120
..safe children...

26:08.440 --> 26:10.240
..to dance on his bones.

26:14.960 --> 26:18.239
My lawyer will make contact
with the church,

26:18.240 --> 26:22.999
the church will make contact
with you and you will tell them

26:23.000 --> 26:27.479
that the godless people of Leith no
longer require your services.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.400
I need to tell his family.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.639
They're innocent.

26:32.640 --> 26:36.159
They spent 20 years wondering
where they went.

26:36.160 --> 26:41.399
We would be voluntarily reopening a
case which could send us to prison.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.639
And, as wee bonus, opening
a crime scene in the middle

26:44.640 --> 26:46.079
of my development.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.760
Well, that's what it is - a crime
scene.

26:52.360 --> 26:55.999
Maggie and I are taking
one of the flats.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.839
I could have chosen any one of them
and I chose one that looks right

27:00.840 --> 27:05.040
over that park because I want
to know that he's there.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.840
I want to know that we put
him there.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.839
That's what I find my peace.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.839
Well, you didn't do it.
Neither did you.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.280
What does that mean?

27:19.760 --> 27:26.279
You were out before this, out of my
world and the terrible things

27:26.280 --> 27:27.640
that happen in it.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.600
Sell us the church and stay out.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.200
I need to tell Albert's family...

27:36.240 --> 27:37.800
..that's my redemption.

27:39.320 --> 27:40.800
I can't protect you.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.480
From what? From whom.

27:54.440 --> 27:58.639
Do you think it's in the genes?
What we've got?

27:58.640 --> 28:00.240
Erm...

28:04.040 --> 28:09.519
There was, there was a birthday,
I must have been seven or eight.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.719
I was supposed to be getting
a Scalextric, right?

28:11.720 --> 28:15.359
Mum had put the money away, Dad went
out to get it and there it was

28:15.360 --> 28:17.439
in the morning,
all wrapped up.

28:17.440 --> 28:22.159
But then I opened it
and it wasn't a Scalextric,

28:22.160 --> 28:23.999
it was a dressing gown.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.479
It was my...
It was my dad's dressing gown.

28:26.480 --> 28:28.679
He'd spunked the money,
woken up drunk and wrapped up

28:28.680 --> 28:32.359
the first thing he saw,
which was his dressing gown.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.319
And it's hard to get my head
around it now

28:34.320 --> 28:37.639
but he tried to brazen out. He said,
"That looks just like mine."

28:37.640 --> 28:41.719
Sitting there in his pants with red
eyes and no dressing gown

28:41.720 --> 28:44.479
observing that the dressing gown
in my hands

28:44.480 --> 28:46.079
happened to look like his.

28:46.080 --> 28:50.159
And then my mum banjoed him
with a breakfast tray and...

28:50.160 --> 28:52.239
..that was my birthday.

28:52.240 --> 28:55.200
So, yeah,
I think it's in the genes.

28:59.720 --> 29:04.639
Odd, isn't it, doing this
without a drink inside us?

29:04.640 --> 29:06.480
Yeah. Scary. Very.

29:10.080 --> 29:14.839
I suppose it's going to be odd doing
a lot of things without that.

29:14.840 --> 29:18.240
Yeah. And they'll be scary too.

29:22.200 --> 29:25.319
Maybe better.

29:25.320 --> 29:27.360
Maybe better.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.959
Are you sure you need to go?

29:39.960 --> 29:42.599
This house just seems
to get emptier.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.959
I've got to get ready for tomorrow.

29:44.960 --> 29:48.280
Fraudulent legal documents
don't write themselves.

31:10.600 --> 31:13.600
All right, Sandy.
You all right, kids.

31:18.080 --> 31:19.840
TYRES SCREECH

31:45.440 --> 31:48.120
DOOR SLIDES OPEN

31:54.480 --> 31:56.959
If you don't turn up,
I come and find you.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.199
I was busy.

31:58.200 --> 31:59.919
I could see that.

31:59.920 --> 32:03.040
I thought the daughter had skipped
town years ago.

32:04.640 --> 32:06.360
She looks pretty in red.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.159
I'm working on something.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.479
And I'm sure you enjoy doing so,

32:15.480 --> 32:18.800
but now you're here
and you're not going home.

32:19.960 --> 32:22.039
We gave it a go.

32:22.040 --> 32:25.199
I'm close. I've been close
for a long time.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.359
I don't need you to be close.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.800
Roy killed someone.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.439
You'll have to be more specific.

32:33.440 --> 32:36.399
Christmas Eve, maybe 20 years ago,
I don't know.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.119
His daughter knows about it.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.599
That's what I'm working on.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.800
Every time I see her,
I get a little more.

32:46.760 --> 32:49.599
They'd need a confession or a body.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.399
Well, I'll try and get both.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.959
You need to focus, Max.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.759
Two weeks.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.279
Can't do it in two weeks!

32:57.280 --> 32:59.559
My advice would be to stop.

32:59.560 --> 33:02.719
Whatever it is you're doing,
whatever you're hiding from me,

33:02.720 --> 33:06.080
I'll find out.
So my advice would be to stop.

33:07.440 --> 33:10.279
You know, I've been lying
here all morning.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.839
Listening to the seagulls.

33:12.840 --> 33:17.199
Nothing happens in Edinburgh that
Roy doesn't hear about.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.359
We'll put you on a train back.

33:19.360 --> 33:21.719
Nice wee journey over the bridge.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.919
73 men died building that bridge.

33:23.920 --> 33:27.400
The least you can do is enjoy the
trip. The seagulls made me wonder...

33:28.720 --> 33:32.719
..if maybe you're doing a bit of
hiding yourself.

33:32.720 --> 33:35.519
Everyone has a boss.

33:35.520 --> 33:41.160
I wonder if your boss knows
about me being here.

33:43.120 --> 33:46.799
I wonder if they know
about you and Roy.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.719
I wonder if you're worried
that they will,

33:48.720 --> 33:50.479
and that's why I've only got
two weeks.

33:50.480 --> 33:54.399
I wonder if they see that Roy's
inside you.

33:54.400 --> 33:57.159
Like he's inside me.
With me it's revenge,

33:57.160 --> 34:00.360
with you I don't know.

34:01.520 --> 34:04.319
But it's not normal.

34:04.320 --> 34:05.960
This isn't normal.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.599
Two weeks.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.200
A confession or a body.

35:11.880 --> 35:14.959
It's just it's Nathaniel's swimming
lesson the night.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.719
Max isn't in, but...

35:16.720 --> 35:18.679
I can't find the papers.

35:18.680 --> 35:20.759
I shouldn't think
they'd be ready yet.

35:20.760 --> 35:23.519
I thought if I serve them on her
there. You wouldn't be serving her.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.999
Then I could say something about
her being in the deep end,

35:26.000 --> 35:27.879
like a pun sort of thing.

35:27.880 --> 35:30.439
Right. I'm still working that
bit out.

35:30.440 --> 35:31.479
Fucking perfect.

35:31.480 --> 35:34.279
I'm just saying to your man here
that it's Nathaniel swimming lesson

35:34.280 --> 35:36.399
tonight, you see, and I've got this
whole pun thing

35:36.400 --> 35:38.799
that I'm playing with. Give us a
couple of days, OK?

35:38.800 --> 35:40.599
Aye, all right, pal.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.200
We'll get there, eh?

35:45.200 --> 35:49.119
I've been trying to get
a hold of you. My phone died.

35:49.120 --> 35:52.799
What's up? Teddy came in, which was
as much fun as it sounds. And?

35:52.800 --> 35:55.240
He found the photo
from the casino.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.439
I haven't got time to deal
with Teddy.

35:58.440 --> 36:01.320
I don't know if that's
a situation that you control.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.639
Their business is clean.

36:05.640 --> 36:08.320
Whatever Max is doing,
Kenny's not involved.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.359
I want you to look into
something for me.

36:12.360 --> 36:13.879
A disappearance.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.519
Here's the name. Pull the record.

36:15.520 --> 36:17.879
See if anything jumps out.

36:17.880 --> 36:19.559
When? Christmas Eve, '98.

36:19.560 --> 36:23.719
He was last seen drinking alone
in the pub in the Cowgate.

36:23.720 --> 36:27.679
He'd retired a week before. Social
services at the council.

36:27.680 --> 36:30.359
Before that, he taught at the
children's home

36:30.360 --> 36:33.999
in Salamander Street,
the one that burnt down.

36:34.000 --> 36:39.159
I can't lose my past, but maybe
I can find an ending to be proud of.

36:39.160 --> 36:42.320
An ending which might right
some wrongs.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.479
You've made your mother very happy.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.720
She deserves it.

36:49.760 --> 36:52.479
Here we are then.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.239
Erin. Max McCall.

36:55.240 --> 36:59.199
So, it's a standard agreement.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.239
Land is held in trust,

37:02.240 --> 37:05.799
which is divided equally

37:05.800 --> 37:08.919
between the three of them.
We can take them.

37:08.920 --> 37:12.599
I paid this lot enough, let them
have a wee look.

37:12.600 --> 37:13.640
Good idea.

37:21.760 --> 37:22.919
Is that a problem?

37:22.920 --> 37:23.960
No.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.079
Well? She signed it.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.999
But?

37:44.000 --> 37:46.920
There's something about her and Max.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.679
You had him checked?

37:50.680 --> 37:52.359
Yes.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.839
But?

37:54.840 --> 37:56.160
She stood up.

37:58.120 --> 38:02.039
When she saw Max in the corridor,
when she saw him for the first time,

38:02.040 --> 38:05.719
when lots of other men had walked
down the corridor, but...

38:05.720 --> 38:08.279
..for him, she stood up.

38:08.280 --> 38:11.400
The insurance? Arrives today.

38:13.400 --> 38:17.079
And the Messiah?
He wants redemption.

38:17.080 --> 38:20.559
Why do men take their lives
so seriously?

38:20.560 --> 38:22.239
Fear.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.880
I'll go. I thought you might.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.319
As your daughter round for her tea.

38:29.320 --> 38:31.319
She won't eat with me.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.600
She will with us.

38:42.440 --> 38:45.919
I'm going to sell the land
on your behalf. When?

38:45.920 --> 38:47.040
Next few days.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.119
What's the rush? Surely it's worth
more when it's finished.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.959
Well, the quicker we get it done,

38:52.960 --> 38:57.199
the less chance we have of getting
caught. Your ex...

38:57.200 --> 38:59.199
What about him?

38:59.200 --> 39:02.879
He looks like a complete fanny.

39:02.880 --> 39:04.159
Where is he?

39:04.160 --> 39:05.480
No idea.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.679
Drugs would be the short answer.

39:10.680 --> 39:11.960
What about you?

39:13.440 --> 39:17.560
Well, getting served divorce papers
in prison felt like a nadir.

39:19.680 --> 39:22.559
I've been thinking about you
and your parents

39:22.560 --> 39:26.079
and wondering what it was that
brought you back together,

39:26.080 --> 39:27.239
back into contact.

39:27.240 --> 39:30.079
The only thing I could imagine was
that you got yourself

39:30.080 --> 39:32.959
into a position that only your
father could help you out of.

39:32.960 --> 39:36.560
And I wondered if you wanted
to talk to me about that.

39:38.480 --> 39:40.640
I've been thinking about you, too.

39:43.120 --> 39:46.639
About how you want to send
my dad to prison.

39:46.640 --> 39:50.359
And I keep thinking whether or not
that's something

39:50.360 --> 39:51.920
you'd be doing alone.

39:53.720 --> 39:57.639
And I wondered if you wanted
to talk to me about that.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.240
Or...

40:02.720 --> 40:04.560
..we move forward together.

40:06.640 --> 40:09.840
Don't look too closely
at each other's scars.

40:15.520 --> 40:21.560
MUSIC: Nothing's Gonna Hurt You Baby
by Cigarettes After Sex

41:10.040 --> 41:12.359
Did you finish the book?

41:12.360 --> 41:13.880
I'm twice through it.

41:16.680 --> 41:20.879
And you know what happened
when he left the jungle?

41:20.880 --> 41:22.640
Aye.

41:26.960 --> 41:28.240
He was free.

41:32.400 --> 41:37.599
Free and happy and safe

41:37.600 --> 41:39.280
in the jungle.

41:43.080 --> 41:44.760
But he wanted revenge.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.479
And it ate him up.

41:52.480 --> 41:55.880
Till he couldn't take it any more.

41:57.480 --> 42:01.320
And so Papillon left the jungle
to take his revenge.

42:04.280 --> 42:06.599
You saw how that went.

42:06.600 --> 42:07.840
I need it.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.199
Same way you do.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.999
I'm still working it out.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.320
So am I.

42:18.440 --> 42:20.040
I was in her house.

42:23.240 --> 42:24.800
She's awfully bonnie.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.120
That's Roy Lynch's daughter.

42:32.280 --> 42:35.120
Might as well get hung for a sheep
as a lamb.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.320
That's right, isn't it?

42:39.480 --> 42:41.959
Or is it the other way round?
It wasn't her.

42:41.960 --> 42:45.719
I'm worried you might be
a wee bit biased.

42:45.720 --> 42:49.160
I'm worried you think you're safe
from me.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.080
You're not safe from me.

42:54.480 --> 42:56.959
Not by a country mile.

42:56.960 --> 42:59.200
I'll find out what happened
to your brother.

43:00.640 --> 43:04.159
I'll give you what you need.
I need you...

43:04.160 --> 43:06.520
..to tell me where to send
the anger...

43:08.240 --> 43:09.599
..before it takes over.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.319
I will.

43:11.320 --> 43:12.720
I promise.

43:20.400 --> 43:22.520
I haven't forgotten, Teddy...

43:23.720 --> 43:25.360
..what you did for me.

43:28.440 --> 43:30.840
You didnae belong in there, Maxie.

43:33.720 --> 43:35.520
But when I look at you now...

43:37.800 --> 43:40.160
..I don't know if you belong
out here either.

43:50.400 --> 43:51.840
DOOR OPENS

43:53.800 --> 43:55.039
DOOR CLOSES

43:55.040 --> 43:56.880
HE EXHALES SHAKILY

44:06.560 --> 44:08.040
PHONE LINE RINGS OUT

44:13.600 --> 44:15.359
JACKIE: Yes?

44:15.360 --> 44:17.559
I pulled the original
witness statement.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.559
The barman had two goes at it.

44:19.560 --> 44:21.359
First time, he said
the victim left the pub

44:21.360 --> 44:22.919
with someone else on Christmas Eve,

44:22.920 --> 44:24.679
someone the barman recognised.

44:24.680 --> 44:26.679
Roy? Close.

44:26.680 --> 44:28.359
His wife.

44:28.360 --> 44:31.639
The barman identified Maggie Lynch,
then came back the next day

44:31.640 --> 44:33.519
and asked to change his statement.

44:33.520 --> 44:35.759
I bet he did.
SHE CHUCKLES

44:35.760 --> 44:38.919
What do you want me to do?
Pull back from Kenny.

44:38.920 --> 44:41.760
Let's give Max all the space
he needs to give us Roy.

44:43.480 --> 44:45.039
That's not easy.

44:45.040 --> 44:46.399
It's very easy.

44:46.400 --> 44:49.119
Pull back or you're off
the investigation.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.599
Unless Kenny is worth
more than Stevie.

44:51.600 --> 44:53.040
JACKIE HANGS UP

45:16.680 --> 45:18.639
You deserve it.

45:18.640 --> 45:20.399
What?

45:20.400 --> 45:22.080
Redemption.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.359
PHONE LINES RINGS OUT

45:30.360 --> 45:31.840
PHONE RINGS

45:33.200 --> 45:35.759
I was just thinking about you.

45:35.760 --> 45:37.720
What happened can't happen again.

45:39.120 --> 45:40.440
Right...

45:42.040 --> 45:44.559
The meetings, all that,
that's...that's great,

45:44.560 --> 45:46.760
but we can't...

45:48.960 --> 45:51.240
We need to stop the other thing.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.680
I don't...

45:58.000 --> 46:01.079
I don't want to,
but we have to stop.

46:01.080 --> 46:02.680
I'm sorry, Kenny.

46:10.520 --> 46:14.119
I spent 30 years

46:14.120 --> 46:16.360
watching Roy fight it.

46:17.680 --> 46:19.959
Sometimes he won,

46:19.960 --> 46:23.159
a few days, the odd month,

46:23.160 --> 46:25.239
then it came back,

46:25.240 --> 46:28.680
the nightmares,
the fear of the dark.

46:30.840 --> 46:33.000
I tried to help in my own way.

46:34.840 --> 46:36.919
Had it burnt down -

46:36.920 --> 46:40.479
that was a birthday present,
and it seemed to help,

46:40.480 --> 46:42.400
he seemed to have got past it.

46:44.520 --> 46:50.239
But then that man retired
and got his photo in the paper,

46:50.240 --> 46:54.279
and they talked about everything
he did for the kids in there,

46:54.280 --> 46:56.879
the orphans and the unwanted,

46:56.880 --> 46:59.560
the stricken wee souls.

47:01.400 --> 47:05.800
Then after that, well,
Roy couldn't come to bed at all.

47:06.960 --> 47:10.280
He just sat up
watching his westerns.

47:14.600 --> 47:16.040
That night...

47:17.280 --> 47:20.159
..Roy thought the same as you,

47:20.160 --> 47:22.439
that you were going to talk to him,

47:22.440 --> 47:24.519
confront him,

47:24.520 --> 47:26.719
seek solace in a confession,

47:26.720 --> 47:29.400
but I knew that wouldn't end it.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.480
So before you got there...

47:35.680 --> 47:39.400
..and it was just me and that man...

47:42.280 --> 47:44.399
Well...

47:44.400 --> 47:46.440
..you must remember the blood.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.920
He was dying when you got there.

47:52.360 --> 47:54.759
What you did, Sandy,

47:54.760 --> 47:56.040
it was a mercy.

47:57.320 --> 48:00.999
And the guilt you've carried
wasn't meant for you.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.639
It's not just him that brings
the guilt.

48:03.640 --> 48:05.519
I know.

48:05.520 --> 48:08.280
It's me, it's this.

48:11.440 --> 48:13.280
That was a mercy too.

48:14.960 --> 48:18.759
When you drove me off the road
and I woke up in the infirmary,

48:18.760 --> 48:20.879
do you know what I thought?

48:20.880 --> 48:23.360
What luck! What fortune!

48:24.680 --> 48:27.679
Because they were coming for us.

48:27.680 --> 48:30.720
The police, she was after Roy.

48:31.960 --> 48:36.199
And soon enough, she would have
seen through Roy to me.

48:36.200 --> 48:38.759
You gave me a way to hide.

48:38.760 --> 48:40.519
You liberated me

48:40.520 --> 48:44.319
to do what I'd always done
from behind a curtain

48:44.320 --> 48:46.720
from behind this.

48:49.720 --> 48:52.240
You gave us a story to tell...

48:54.160 --> 48:56.040
..which is all it ever was...

48:59.240 --> 49:00.800
..a story.

49:07.920 --> 49:11.120
I remember the man you where.

49:13.320 --> 49:18.400
And you remember the women I was,
don't you?

49:20.360 --> 49:21.920
And I'm still that women.

49:23.400 --> 49:25.520
And I think, behind it all...

49:27.480 --> 49:29.400
..you're still that man.

49:31.960 --> 49:33.360
There we go.

49:34.760 --> 49:36.439
There you are.

49:36.440 --> 49:38.479
Still with us.

49:38.480 --> 49:42.599
Still a man who understands
the world,

49:42.600 --> 49:44.799
our world,

49:44.800 --> 49:47.799
with all its confusion,

49:47.800 --> 49:50.240
all its betrayal.

49:53.440 --> 49:55.200
You didn't kill him.

49:56.520 --> 49:58.720
And you didn't cripple me.

49:59.760 --> 50:01.919
And your betrayal,

50:01.920 --> 50:04.440
our betrayal...

50:05.440 --> 50:06.960
..can stay here with you.

50:08.320 --> 50:10.960
There's your redemption.

50:17.720 --> 50:19.960
Now sell us the fucking church.

50:22.920 --> 50:25.239
Did you get parked OK? Yeah.

50:25.240 --> 50:26.839
It's supposed to be allocated,

50:26.840 --> 50:29.200
but it can be a bit of
a free for all.

50:33.720 --> 50:35.200
Where's Mum?

50:36.360 --> 50:38.559
She's a wee bit poorly.

50:38.560 --> 50:40.760
Migraines, you know how she gets.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.360
Drink.

51:01.080 --> 51:04.679
# Count me out
I'm heading to Ecuador

51:04.680 --> 51:06.799
# No more letters

51:06.800 --> 51:08.759
# We destroyed them all

51:08.760 --> 51:10.759
# Counting coins

51:10.760 --> 51:12.759
# Bits of copper crime

51:12.760 --> 51:14.719
# Stare at the stars

51:14.720 --> 51:16.799
# Feeling out of line

51:16.800 --> 51:18.679
# Out of time

51:18.680 --> 51:20.679
# Out of time

51:20.680 --> 51:22.799
# Out of my body

51:22.800 --> 51:24.799
# Out of my mind

51:24.800 --> 51:26.799
# Maybe I've lost it

51:26.800 --> 51:28.719
# Who even cares?

51:28.720 --> 51:30.159
# Bury my head

51:30.160 --> 51:32.639
# Until this life becomes fair

51:32.640 --> 51:34.799
# And I grow tired

51:34.800 --> 51:36.839
# But dare not fall asleep

51:36.840 --> 51:39.399
# Who knows what will await

51:39.400 --> 51:41.079
# If I fall too deep?

51:41.080 --> 51:43.159
# Call it a mission

51:43.160 --> 51:44.759
# Call it a inner fear

51:44.760 --> 51:46.559
# But I am awake

51:46.560 --> 51:50.880
# I am awake, I am awake... #

51:54.560 --> 51:56.400
HE CHUCKLES

52:18.880 --> 52:22.000
MUSIC: Police and Thieves
by The Clash

52:25.240 --> 52:28.200
# They're going through a tight wind

52:47.800 --> 52:51.759
# Police and thieves in the street

52:51.760 --> 52:53.999
# Oh, yeah

52:54.000 --> 53:00.119
# Scaring the nation with their
guns and ammunition

53:00.120 --> 53:03.039
# Police and thieves
in the street... #

53:03.040 --> 53:05.039
KNOCK AT DOOR

53:05.040 --> 53:06.719
# Oh, yeah

53:06.720 --> 53:11.719
# Fighting the nation with their
guns and ammunition... #

53:11.720 --> 53:13.559
KNOCKING

53:13.560 --> 53:19.279
# From Genesis to Revelation

53:19.280 --> 53:22.519
# The next generation

53:22.520 --> 53:25.919
# Will be, hear me... #
HE SIGHS

53:25.920 --> 53:27.480
DOOR BREAKS OPEN

53:28.720 --> 53:33.239
RECORDING: Let me work for you
full time on Phoenix,

53:33.240 --> 53:35.240
and I can keep you invisible.

53:36.600 --> 53:38.999
What about your partner?

53:39.000 --> 53:40.360
Fuck her.

54:06.200 --> 54:08.199
PHONE RINGS
SIREN WAILS

54:08.200 --> 54:09.720
I was serious.

54:10.760 --> 54:14.920
Why did you ask
if I could trust Max?

54:16.400 --> 54:17.920
We have to stop.

54:31.200 --> 54:34.919
You know, the reason I enjoy
the Westerns so much,

54:34.920 --> 54:37.479
the reason they give me
a little serenity

54:37.480 --> 54:39.559
in the middle of the night,

54:39.560 --> 54:41.320
is their simplicity.

54:44.280 --> 54:46.759
If you don't know
who the good guys are,

54:46.760 --> 54:49.039
then look for the white hats.

54:49.040 --> 54:53.080
The white hats are good,
the rest are...

54:54.760 --> 54:56.760
..different degrees of bad.

54:58.040 --> 55:01.679
And I suppose I wish
the world was like that,

55:01.680 --> 55:05.880
but I realised,
when I was just a wee boy...

55:07.680 --> 55:09.200
..that it isn't...

55:11.040 --> 55:16.360
..that evil is always looking for
a more surprising place to hide.

55:17.800 --> 55:19.159
What is this, Dad?

55:19.160 --> 55:22.760
I understand, Erin,
if Max came to you, persuaded you...

55:23.960 --> 55:26.360
..if he told you that he was a man
in a white hat...

55:27.920 --> 55:30.720
..and that he was going to
bring me down...

55:32.240 --> 55:35.080
..and maybe that you should
help him.

55:36.600 --> 55:38.680
But life isn't simple.

55:40.400 --> 55:44.360
He's not as good as you think,
and I'm not as bad as you think.

55:46.280 --> 55:47.919
Everything is in between,

55:47.920 --> 55:52.159
everything is murky
in this world, Erin,

55:52.160 --> 55:54.560
and you are lost within it.

55:56.640 --> 56:00.119
So let me help you
find your way out,

56:00.120 --> 56:02.200
and we'll do the same for him.

56:06.040 --> 56:07.680
Where's Mum?

56:11.120 --> 56:12.480
Dad.

56:13.680 --> 56:15.080
Where's Mum?

56:16.280 --> 56:17.560
Migraines.

56:19.960 --> 56:21.640
You know how she gets.

56:25.760 --> 56:29.639
We've never liked risk, Roy and I.

56:29.640 --> 56:33.159
Everything we've got,
every inch we've gained,

56:33.160 --> 56:35.999
our first thought is
how to defend it,

56:36.000 --> 56:38.479
how to insure it,

56:38.480 --> 56:41.639
and whoever we work with,
we do the same,

56:41.640 --> 56:43.759
we have insurance.

56:43.760 --> 56:46.639
Your bent copper can look at me
all day, he'll never find anything.

56:46.640 --> 56:49.679
I'm not talking about bent coppers,
that's nothing.

56:49.680 --> 56:51.159
That's admin.

56:51.160 --> 56:53.040
I'm talking about you...

56:55.520 --> 56:57.680
..about your weakness.

57:04.200 --> 57:07.479
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

57:07.480 --> 57:10.440
FOOTSTEPS

57:21.960 --> 57:24.039
There it is.

57:24.040 --> 57:26.479
There's our insurance.

57:26.480 --> 57:27.920
There's year weakness.

57:48.360 --> 57:51.920
# Roller-roller-coaster

57:54.520 --> 57:59.840
# Buy a ticket for a fancy airplane

58:01.440 --> 58:04.239
# Won't get you nowhere

58:04.240 --> 58:08.519
# Won't catch you no fame

58:08.520 --> 58:14.440
# Mother, I know it's hard
to let go... #
