Yes, your mouth.

00:13.780 --> 00:16.410
I mean, really, look at it.

00:16.410 --> 00:18.170
It's so perfect.

00:18.170 --> 00:20.320
I can feel that pre-wrinkle.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.460
-Oh.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.290
-Yeah.

00:22.290 --> 00:25.020
-I should probably moisturise.

00:25.020 --> 00:25.970
-Oh my god.

00:25.970 --> 00:28.330
Does Mom know?

00:28.330 --> 00:31.270
-I don't know what Mum
knows and doesn't know.

00:31.270 --> 00:36.510
-I see you completely as like
I've never seen you before.

00:36.510 --> 00:37.210

SYD: You need to work
out a little more.

01:45.790 --> 01:48.420
No wonder you're always
with the little waify girls.

01:48.420 --> 01:49.120

tell Ali, are you?

mentioning this to Ali, OK?

02:34.030 --> 02:35.490
I told you I
wouldn't, and I won't.

02:49.380 --> 02:51.670
-Um, there was the
hole in the fence.

babysat you that drove you

03:10.670 --> 03:14.550
around and took advantage of
your sweet little teenage bod.

03:14.550 --> 03:18.400
And it was super lecherous.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.300
-Uh, if by lecherous,
you mean rad.

-I mean, what if you
were the 15-year-old girl

03:36.020 --> 03:38.360
and it was a 25-year-old
guy driving you around?

03:38.360 --> 03:39.960
Who's fucking you?

03:39.960 --> 03:40.760
Doesn't that seem weird?

Wait.

04:08.580 --> 04:09.770
Wait for it.

04:12.930 --> 04:14.140
Yes.

04:14.140 --> 04:15.900
Oh, that's great.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.570
I'm so glad to be rid
of that wig, you know?

04:18.570 --> 04:20.540
My scalp can-- can breathe.

04:20.540 --> 04:22.270
I felt like I was
wearing a sheitel.

04:22.270 --> 04:24.240
-Well, now, you look
much more powerful,

04:24.240 --> 04:25.920
like a California earth mama.

04:25.920 --> 04:26.620
-Oh.

04:26.620 --> 04:27.950
Not a silver vixen?

04:27.950 --> 04:29.140
-Well, maybe a silverback.

04:29.140 --> 04:31.920
Listen, can we just close
up shop here a little bit.

04:31.920 --> 04:35.100
And these-- your male privilege
is leaking all over the place.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.630
And-- but you don't
have to slouch.

04:36.630 --> 04:39.630
Keep yourself up and owning it.

04:39.630 --> 04:41.790
It's called femininity.

04:41.790 --> 04:43.210
Yeah.

04:43.210 --> 04:44.780
-Move it.

04:44.780 --> 04:46.490
-Let me fix your walk.

04:46.490 --> 04:47.530
-Please.

04:47.530 --> 04:48.230
My knee?

04:48.230 --> 04:49.160
-I know your knee.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.130
Walk without the complaining.

04:50.130 --> 04:50.990
How about that?

04:50.990 --> 04:51.820
-All right.

04:51.820 --> 04:52.520
-Forward.

04:55.190 --> 04:55.930
Take a breath.

04:55.930 --> 04:58.100
Try not to hold your
breath quite so much.

04:58.100 --> 04:58.800
MAURA: All right.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.050
-Try and breathe and be in it.

05:00.050 --> 05:00.750
-All right.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.530
Would you like me to
breathe and be in it?

05:02.530 --> 05:04.020
-Please?

05:04.020 --> 05:05.250
Find your centre, huh?

05:05.250 --> 05:06.450
-Oh, this is stupid.

05:10.480 --> 05:11.930
-Hello.
CONCIERGE: Hi, may I help you?

05:11.930 --> 05:12.630

05:16.790 --> 05:17.490
CONCIERGE: OK.

05:17.490 --> 05:18.270
Ah.

05:18.270 --> 05:18.970
Mr. Baker.

05:18.970 --> 05:20.870
Could I get a
credit card, please.

05:20.870 --> 05:23.720
-Oh, I'll be-- I'll
pay, uh, pay in cash.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.010
-We just need a
credit card on file

05:25.010 --> 05:26.330
in case there's any incidental.

05:26.330 --> 05:27.030
-Oh, no.

05:27.030 --> 05:31.210
I'll-- I'll-- I'll pay
in cash for that too.

05:31.210 --> 05:34.700
-If don't use the bar
or order any movies,

05:34.700 --> 05:36.550
nothing will appear
on your bill.

05:36.550 --> 05:37.990
-Oh.

05:37.990 --> 05:38.940
OK.

05:38.940 --> 05:41.760
-I've got you covered, sir.

05:41.760 --> 05:42.670
-Well, then, here we go.

05:42.670 --> 05:43.370
CONCIERGE: Great.

Here's your key.
Room 313, please.

05:46.090 --> 05:46.790
-Um, right.

05:46.790 --> 05:49.240
And if you don't mind, um,
if it's all the same to you,

05:49.240 --> 05:50.880
I could-- give me another key.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.580
-Of course.

MARCIE: No one has
ever seen me but me.

06:12.410 --> 06:13.890
-Yeah.

06:13.890 --> 06:15.380
No one's ever seen me except me.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.350
-Tah-dah.

06:22.350 --> 06:23.840
-Oh my god, you're beautiful.

You hate it.

06:43.640 --> 06:43.970
I get it.

06:43.970 --> 06:44.770
-No, no, no, no.

06:44.770 --> 06:45.740
-Oh, you don't like it.

06:45.740 --> 06:49.570
It's just-- it's-- it's
too-- it's strippery.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.650
I'm sorry.

06:54.650 --> 06:55.920
But it's not right.

06:59.770 --> 07:02.730
You need something elegant.

07:06.030 --> 07:06.730
You're Maura.

07:16.420 --> 07:17.810
-What's your name?

07:17.810 --> 07:19.300
MARCIE: My name is Marcie.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.280
What is your name?

07:24.740 --> 07:27.280
-My name is Maura.

07:27.280 --> 07:27.980
-Hey.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.720
-Hey, babe, what happened?

07:29.720 --> 07:30.590
Did you tell Barb?

07:30.590 --> 07:31.290
Hey.

07:31.290 --> 07:32.460
How'd it go?

07:32.460 --> 07:33.290
How'd it go?

07:33.290 --> 07:33.990
How'd it go?

07:33.990 --> 07:34.970
-Uh, it was good.

07:34.970 --> 07:35.670
It was good.

07:35.670 --> 07:36.890
It was good.

07:36.890 --> 07:37.590
-Cool.

07:37.590 --> 07:38.290
So she's OK.

07:38.290 --> 07:40.230
She's-- she survived.

07:40.230 --> 07:41.210
-Yeah.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.350
Yeah, she's-- she's OK.

07:42.350 --> 07:43.050
Yeah.

07:43.050 --> 07:45.700
I mean, it-- it didn't
even come up this time.

07:45.700 --> 07:46.400
-What?

07:46.400 --> 07:49.190
TAMMY: Yeah, I'm just gonna
wait until the next therapy,

07:49.190 --> 07:51.320
because-- yeah, our
shrink was a little late,

07:51.320 --> 07:52.890
which started the
session out weird.

07:52.890 --> 07:56.130
And then before I even had
a chance to say anything,

07:56.130 --> 07:57.580
Bard started talking
about how her sister's

07:57.580 --> 07:59.040
lupus is affecting her.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.430
Did I tell you that Barb's
sister Joanie has lupus?

08:01.430 --> 08:03.890
-No.

08:03.890 --> 08:04.970
-Well, she does.

08:04.970 --> 08:09.040
And, um, yeah, Barb
was just like-- oh

08:09.040 --> 08:10.380
my god, she was in such a state.

08:10.380 --> 08:13.280
And I just feel like, you
know, the-- the more Barb

08:13.280 --> 08:23.850
is OK with herself when I tell
her, then, more-- come here.

08:23.850 --> 08:24.810
Come here.

08:24.810 --> 08:26.250
Come here, come here, come here.

08:30.090 --> 08:32.650
I am gonna tell her, OK?

08:32.650 --> 08:35.600
I am.

08:35.600 --> 08:40.170
I'm gonna make this
all happen, OK?

08:40.170 --> 08:43.080
You move so fast.

08:43.080 --> 08:49.670
You're like a, like a little
hummingbird, you know?

08:49.670 --> 08:56.490
You're like this little tiny
hummingbird with big boobs.

08:56.490 --> 09:00.390
I can't keep my
hands off your tits.

09:00.390 --> 09:03.810
God, what is wrong with me?

09:03.810 --> 09:05.760
See, this is what you do to me.

09:11.620 --> 09:13.600
OK.

09:13.600 --> 09:14.610
-Holy shit.

09:14.610 --> 09:15.430
-What?

09:15.430 --> 09:18.830
-My dad came out to Ali.

09:18.830 --> 09:19.800
Holy fuck.

09:23.670 --> 09:24.760
ALI: Oh my god.

09:24.760 --> 09:25.460
Oh my god.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.960
SARAH: You were fucking
high when you saw him?

09:27.960 --> 09:30.720
-I was like basically
trying to make out with Dad.

09:30.720 --> 09:31.550
SARAH: Oh, god.

09:31.550 --> 09:32.250
ALI: Oh my god.

09:32.250 --> 09:35.260
And his toenails were painted,
but because his little toenail

09:35.260 --> 09:38.110
is so little squished he
just painted the toe skin.

09:38.110 --> 09:38.810
-Oh, god!

09:38.810 --> 09:39.510
Her.

09:39.510 --> 09:40.780
Her toe skin.

09:40.780 --> 09:41.710
-Oh my god!

09:44.480 --> 09:45.270
So weird.

09:45.270 --> 09:46.250
This is so weird.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.090
-It's fucking insane.

09:47.090 --> 09:48.060
No, it's insane.

09:48.060 --> 09:49.500
It's totally insane.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.200
ALI: Oh my god.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.150
And I renamed him-- her.

09:52.150 --> 09:52.900
Her, him.

09:52.900 --> 09:53.880
What do I call him or her?

09:53.880 --> 09:54.680
SARAH: What do you mean?

09:54.680 --> 09:56.170
-I renamed him last
night and I started

09:56.170 --> 10:00.290
calling her-- her-- Moppa.

10:00.290 --> 10:00.990
SARAH: Moppa?

10:00.990 --> 10:04.210
ALI: Yeah, like Momma and Papa.

10:04.210 --> 10:05.040
Moppa.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.690
-That's actually really sweet.

10:06.690 --> 10:07.650
ALI: It's not sweet.

10:07.650 --> 10:08.620
It's insanity.

10:08.620 --> 10:09.780
I have to pee.
