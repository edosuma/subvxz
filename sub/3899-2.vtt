01:18.816 --> 01:22.319
I got 'em when I was 15,
and then, like, 19,

01:22.320 --> 01:25.321
and then other times,
but I never got it on my arms.

01:25.322 --> 01:27.866
And I haven't even been putting
'em near nobody's cha-cha...

01:27.867 --> 01:31.745
except for, like, once, and it
was a while ago and by accident.

01:31.746 --> 01:33.872
You don't get crabs on your arms.

01:33.873 --> 01:36.366
So, what? I got imitation crabs?

01:37.084 --> 01:38.410
Shit.

01:39.754 --> 01:41.671
It's fuckin' bedbugs.

01:41.672 --> 01:42.839
Like scabies?

01:42.840 --> 01:44.549
- [sighs]
- [softly] I thought it was crabs.

01:44.550 --> 01:46.300
Me, too.

01:46.301 --> 01:48.212
[sighs] I miss Ian.

01:48.554 --> 01:51.431
- Aw, that's so sweet.
- Ugh.

01:51.432 --> 01:53.057
You got some shampoo or something?

01:53.058 --> 01:55.935
They don't live on you, just in
your sheets and clothes and shit.

01:55.936 --> 01:57.396
So now we gotta wash everything.

01:57.397 --> 01:58.563
What, you gave 'em to me?

01:58.564 --> 02:00.106
Someone gave it to me first.

02:00.107 --> 02:01.650
- Fuck!
- What's going on?

02:01.651 --> 02:03.192
Flaca's got scabies.

02:03.193 --> 02:05.862
- It's bedbugs. It's different.
- Cooties are cooties.

02:05.863 --> 02:07.656
I probably got it from
your dirty little sister.

02:07.657 --> 02:10.032
They probably been living
in your hairy Chia Pet poon

02:10.033 --> 02:11.117
since before you got here.

02:11.118 --> 02:13.161
First of all, I keep my lawn mowed.

02:13.162 --> 02:14.621
Second, weren't no problems

02:14.622 --> 02:18.458
till Pocket Daya snuck in last week
to follow in the family footsteps.

02:18.459 --> 02:20.209
- Eat it.
- [speaking Spanish]

02:20.210 --> 02:21.294
They got scabies.

02:21.295 --> 02:23.337
Bedbugs, and it's Flaca.

02:23.338 --> 02:26.132
_

02:26.133 --> 02:27.634
[speaking English] Now what?

02:27.635 --> 02:29.428
_

02:29.429 --> 02:31.338
Ay, dios. We're all gonna get 'em.

02:32.306 --> 02:34.307
- You don't have a magic cure or something?
- Hey, hey, hey.

02:34.308 --> 02:35.392
_

02:35.393 --> 02:36.518
[speaking English] I just walked up.

02:36.519 --> 02:37.977
_

02:37.978 --> 02:39.479
[speaking English] No.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.772
So what?

02:40.773 --> 02:43.400
You hear the one
about the pregnant bedbug?

02:43.401 --> 02:45.527
- She gave birth in the spring.
- [chuckles]

02:45.528 --> 02:48.404
But these are just pads.
We don't got bedsprings.

02:48.405 --> 02:49.489
Oh, Jesus.

02:49.490 --> 02:51.608
Okay, everybody, start
stripping the beds!

02:53.661 --> 02:55.537
Fuck!

02:55.538 --> 02:56.830
[man on PA] Attention, ladies,

02:56.831 --> 02:59.583
remember to remove all
pens from your uniform

02:59.584 --> 03:02.077
when dropping off your laundry.

03:06.423 --> 03:07.833
Red, you're back...

03:10.595 --> 03:12.296
and you're not talking to me.

03:15.140 --> 03:16.466
Now what did I do?

03:17.602 --> 03:22.689
My post-slock resolution was to
stop giving liars second chances.

03:22.690 --> 03:24.266
When did I lie to you?

03:27.111 --> 03:31.148
"Business is booming.
There's a line out the door."

03:32.032 --> 03:33.492
- [sighs]
- You were much more convincing

03:33.493 --> 03:35.994
than my husband, but you
were just as stupid.

03:35.995 --> 03:38.371
You could have said you
didn't make your way there.

03:38.372 --> 03:43.285
Instead, you said...
you ate my vatrushkis.

03:44.086 --> 03:46.170
I'm sorry.

03:46.171 --> 03:48.256
I...

03:48.257 --> 03:50.299
I thought that I was
doing the right thing.

03:50.300 --> 03:51.885
By lying?

03:51.886 --> 03:53.887
We read different children's books.

03:53.888 --> 03:58.725
You know... many cultures value a
person's dignity over the truth.

03:58.726 --> 04:00.935
In Korea, they actually call it kibun.

04:00.936 --> 04:03.229
I heard that on The World
with Marco Werman.

04:03.230 --> 04:05.774
In Russia, we call it "bullshit."

04:05.775 --> 04:07.776
Look, there was nothing
you could do about it,

04:07.777 --> 04:10.062
and I thought that I was
saving you some pain.

04:10.780 --> 04:13.156
You thought if you didn't
bring me bad news,

04:13.157 --> 04:14.942
I won't kill the messenger.

04:15.660 --> 04:21.072
I said what I said because I am a
nice person and it felt right.

04:21.791 --> 04:25.244
Nice is for cowards and Democrats.

04:26.420 --> 04:28.330
You're a selfish little person.

04:29.048 --> 04:31.083
You wanted me to like you.

04:31.842 --> 04:34.211
Now I like you less.

04:36.681 --> 04:37.882
[Bennett] Next.

04:38.641 --> 04:42.803
Powell. P-O-W-E-double-L.

04:43.145 --> 04:45.347
Ah, here you are. ID?

04:47.357 --> 04:51.520
Oh, Bennett. [chuckles] Good.
You're George's friend.

04:52.237 --> 04:54.405
- Uh... Yeah, George?
- My son.

04:54.406 --> 04:56.150
He used to work here. George Mendez.

04:58.368 --> 05:03.157
His father, my first husband, is Cuban.
I never could resist an accent.

05:04.208 --> 05:07.286
Guess that runs in the family.

05:09.046 --> 05:13.375
I'm sorry. That was a coping mechanism.

05:14.426 --> 05:16.260
Uh...

05:16.261 --> 05:18.888
Thank you.

05:18.889 --> 05:20.090
George, um...

05:21.767 --> 05:25.095
George says he loves her.
What do you think?

05:26.647 --> 05:30.434
I... I don't know. Maybe.

05:32.778 --> 05:34.855
[stammers] I'm sorry, who
are you here to see?

05:38.117 --> 05:40.493
I know I need to apologize,

05:40.494 --> 05:43.079
but "I'm sorry" feels
a little inadequate.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.373
That baby's got my daughter out to here

05:45.374 --> 05:47.959
and it's too late to Dyson it out of her.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.879
So I hope you're here for
more than a clean conscience.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.632
I'm a concerned grandmother
just like you are.

05:53.633 --> 05:56.175
Although you look nothing
like a grandmother.

05:56.176 --> 05:58.552
Hispanic women have amazing skin.

05:58.553 --> 06:01.055
Let's hope the baby gets my complexion.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.425
What's it gettin' from you?

06:05.477 --> 06:07.179
I know that...

06:08.272 --> 06:12.692
nothing can ever undo
what my son did, but...

06:12.693 --> 06:13.902
this child is part of my family.

06:13.903 --> 06:15.695
He's gonna live with my family.

06:15.696 --> 06:18.823
Your... husband?

06:18.824 --> 06:20.825
My domestic partner.

06:20.826 --> 06:24.746
Who is not actually related
to the baby by blood.

06:24.747 --> 06:29.000
No blood, but he's got the
sweat and tears part down.

06:29.001 --> 06:32.787
He's takin' real good care of my babies,
and he'll do the same for Daya.

06:35.966 --> 06:38.627
I want to adopt the child.

06:41.263 --> 06:46.551
I'm... up nights... haunted...

06:50.355 --> 06:53.399
I can't bear the thought of
the baby winding up like...

06:53.400 --> 06:55.193
Go ahead, say it.

06:55.194 --> 06:56.527
Like her mother?

06:56.528 --> 06:59.564
Like George.

07:02.576 --> 07:05.244
So... you want to raise the baby

07:05.245 --> 07:08.539
so it don't turn out like
the baby you raised?

07:08.540 --> 07:10.458
I have two other boys.

07:10.459 --> 07:14.671
One is in dental school and the
other is an art historian.

07:14.672 --> 07:18.675
So you raised a sadist,
a dentist and a homo.

07:18.676 --> 07:20.509
Two sadists and a homo.

07:20.510 --> 07:22.929
Okay, look...

07:22.930 --> 07:27.308
you have every right to
hate me and George...

07:27.309 --> 07:29.060
but...

07:29.061 --> 07:31.062
I can do right by this child.

07:31.063 --> 07:35.066
I can offer love and... attention

07:35.067 --> 07:37.902
and a certain... lifestyle.

07:37.903 --> 07:40.446
Money don't mean nothing to a child...

07:40.447 --> 07:44.075
- No, but I...
- You're not listening.

07:44.076 --> 07:45.860
To a child.

07:47.037 --> 07:51.366
But my daughter... can't be un-raped...

07:52.376 --> 07:57.088
and she's gonna suffer bad
emotionals her whole life.

07:57.089 --> 07:59.215
We all are.

07:59.216 --> 08:00.834
Well...

08:04.346 --> 08:07.098
I know money could never make that right,

08:07.099 --> 08:11.102
but of course, I would want to
help the mother of my grandchild

08:11.103 --> 08:13.180
in any way I could.

08:15.816 --> 08:18.602
Perhaps on a monthly basis.

08:21.696 --> 08:24.774
And the grandmother of your grandchild?

08:25.492 --> 08:26.910
Of course.

08:26.911 --> 08:28.903
That's the team spirit.

08:41.884 --> 08:44.552
Hey... lady guards only.

08:44.553 --> 08:47.931
Your mom is in visitation right
now with Mendez's mother.

08:47.932 --> 08:49.891
- What the fuck?
- Yeah, did you know she was coming?

08:49.892 --> 08:52.351
- What are they talking about?
- I don't know.

08:52.352 --> 08:54.846
Lady Pornstache wrote me a letter.
She wanted to meet...

08:56.106 --> 08:57.899
but I said no.

08:57.900 --> 09:01.110
I mean, I didn't say nothing
which means I said no.

09:01.111 --> 09:04.238
- Aleida must've written her.
- [sighs]

09:04.239 --> 09:05.949
[Dayanara sighs]

09:05.950 --> 09:09.953
Relax. It's my baby, ours.

09:09.954 --> 09:12.914
Aleida's just probably
trying to shake her down.

09:12.915 --> 09:15.867
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- [sighs]

09:16.543 --> 09:19.746
[chuckles] I don't usually get to
see this much of you all at once.

09:20.505 --> 09:22.506
You like it?

09:22.507 --> 09:23.875
You're into big bellies?

09:27.012 --> 09:29.430
Listen up, ladies!

09:29.431 --> 09:34.227
Until every uniform in this prison
is washed and re-washed...

09:34.228 --> 09:38.689
you'll be wearing Office Depot's...
new fall line.

09:38.690 --> 09:39.773
[woman] Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

09:39.774 --> 09:41.609
I ain't wearing that fucking paper shit.

09:41.610 --> 09:44.854
That's my color. I'm wearing it.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.701
There is one maternity-sized paper suit.

09:50.702 --> 09:52.536
I suggest you grab it...

09:52.537 --> 09:56.741
before one of your plus-sized
dorm-mates claims it for her food baby.

10:01.338 --> 10:04.215
I asked you more than once
to stay away from her

10:04.216 --> 10:08.302
and yet, with the whole dorm
half-naked, here you are.

10:08.303 --> 10:09.796
I'm writing you up, Bennett.

10:11.306 --> 10:14.308
Mendez's mother is meeting
with Aleida Diaz.

10:14.309 --> 10:17.311
I don't care... and neither should you.

10:17.312 --> 10:20.481
That's my kid we're talking about here.

10:20.482 --> 10:23.234
This is not 3 Men and a Baby.

10:23.235 --> 10:27.655
You and Mendez are not
Guttenberg and Selleck.

10:27.656 --> 10:32.076
You are two morons
and a ward of the state.

10:32.077 --> 10:35.329
Let go. Let go of the dream.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.990
[Maxwell] Mr. Caputo.

10:37.374 --> 10:39.250
One box per dorm. That's all there was.

10:39.251 --> 10:41.920
- [sighs]
- [Maritza] I can't walk around

10:41.921 --> 10:45.673
in my butt-bag panties
and my granny bra.

10:45.674 --> 10:48.176
There are more paper
uniforms on their way.

10:48.177 --> 10:50.044
And they'll get here when?

10:51.513 --> 10:53.556
[stuttering] Sometime soon...

10:53.557 --> 10:55.099
hopefully.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.435
Uh, be thankful the weather is nice.

10:57.436 --> 10:59.020
[speaking Spanish]

10:59.021 --> 11:01.981
- CO Bennett, make yourself useful.
- Sir?

11:01.982 --> 11:04.150
Go down to the storage room.

11:04.151 --> 11:06.485
Don't come back until
you find some uniforms

11:06.486 --> 11:08.988
or something uniform-like
and disposable.

11:08.989 --> 11:11.358
Sir. Yes, sir.

11:12.076 --> 11:13.867
Where's the S1?

11:13.868 --> 11:15.320
[indistinct radio chatter]

11:16.163 --> 11:17.781
[helicopter blades whirring]

11:22.669 --> 11:26.039
Corporal John Bennett reporting
as ordered, Sergeant.

11:26.840 --> 11:29.883
Care to let me in on the joke,
Corporal Whoever-the-fuck-you-are?

11:29.884 --> 11:32.595
No disrespect, Sergeant.
Just ready to get in the shit.

11:32.596 --> 11:34.423
Well, look at that, Goggles!

11:35.265 --> 11:39.093
Corporal America is here to
save us from the ragheads.

11:39.686 --> 11:40.936
Hooah!

11:40.937 --> 11:43.223
IA, fall in!

11:45.067 --> 11:46.268
Rifle.

11:51.948 --> 11:55.493
You know, it's always the guy who
thinks he's John Wayne McCain

11:55.494 --> 11:58.121
who shits his pants and needs rescuing.

11:58.122 --> 12:01.749
But out here, we prefer to let
the camel cowboys do the dying.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.328
It's their goddamn country.

12:06.546 --> 12:10.008
Look at you, all nicely starched.

12:10.009 --> 12:11.384
I have a travel iron.

12:11.385 --> 12:13.670
[sniffs]

12:16.973 --> 12:19.892
I smell a fobbit. You
know what a fobbit is?

12:19.893 --> 12:22.353
- I'm not...
- Not what I asked!

12:22.354 --> 12:25.390
Army hobbit. Too chicken to leave
his forward operating base.

12:26.150 --> 12:28.526
You think this shitbag's a fobbit?

12:28.527 --> 12:30.694
Maybe. Don't know...

12:30.695 --> 12:32.530
but he's got the whitest
teeth I've ever seen.

12:32.531 --> 12:34.032
Sergeant, I am not a coward,

12:34.033 --> 12:36.534
and I'm sure as shit not
sorry I'm squared away.

12:36.535 --> 12:39.613
I'm here to soldier,
save lives and get some.

12:48.422 --> 12:50.874
Jesus. What a cluster-knuckle.

12:51.675 --> 12:53.627
Could this be our fault?

12:54.678 --> 12:56.054
[gasps]

12:56.055 --> 12:58.722
- The new couch?
- I did an inspection at the curb.

12:58.723 --> 13:02.393
We're okay except for the
mystery stain, but we febrezed.

13:02.394 --> 13:06.605
If anybody asks anything...
it came from JC Penney.

13:06.606 --> 13:09.483
[man on PA] Work line,
cell block A, 10 minutes.

13:09.484 --> 13:14.273
Bell, Hartford jail's got six boxes of
paper suits they're willing to part with.

13:15.199 --> 13:18.033
Cost me 300 pairs of tube
socks I actually don't have,

13:18.034 --> 13:20.362
but that's a future me problem.

13:20.870 --> 13:23.372
Have Doggett drive you
and Maxwell after lunch.

13:23.373 --> 13:25.199
Roger that.

13:28.545 --> 13:30.796
Looks like it's spreading.

13:30.797 --> 13:33.174
The only thing spreading is rumors.

13:33.175 --> 13:36.252
It was an isolated event that's been...

13:37.762 --> 13:39.631
isolated.

13:42.351 --> 13:45.094
I forgot something in the office.

13:53.903 --> 13:55.355
Uh-uh.

13:56.531 --> 13:57.698
Walk. That's right.

13:57.699 --> 14:01.361
Just walk away, Renee.

14:02.996 --> 14:04.372
[exhales]

14:04.373 --> 14:06.124
- What... [chuckles]
- [sniffs]

14:06.125 --> 14:08.709
You smell like Arthur Avenue.

14:08.710 --> 14:11.920
Whatever, okay? GloNo's
makin' me bedbug-proof.

14:11.921 --> 14:14.548
- GloNo?
- Gloria and Norma.

14:14.549 --> 14:15.674
Oh, hell no.

14:15.675 --> 14:18.927
Hey, look, whatever you wanna call
'em, they for real, all right?

14:18.928 --> 14:20.304
Especially Norma.

14:20.305 --> 14:23.849
She got that whole magic
mute thing going on.

14:23.850 --> 14:27.436
Look, and this makes sense, okay?
Bedbugs drink our blood.

14:27.437 --> 14:30.606
- They're bugs, not Dracula.
- [sucks teeth]

14:30.607 --> 14:33.609
And now that you been necklace
shopping in Burritoville,

14:33.610 --> 14:35.361
you gettin' 'em for sure.

14:35.362 --> 14:36.904
- Man, why they still makin' our food...
- Whatever.

14:36.905 --> 14:39.698
...when they're the infested ones?

14:39.699 --> 14:40.783
Oh, shit.

14:40.784 --> 14:42.285
- [Taystee] Ew!
- Why you...

14:42.286 --> 14:44.662
No, it's protein.

14:44.663 --> 14:47.949
Crunch. It's all good.

14:50.210 --> 14:51.752
Hey, you're scratching.

14:51.753 --> 14:55.214
It ain't real, man. It's... a ghost itch.

14:55.215 --> 14:57.049
- [Crazy Eyes] Mmm.
- Power of persuasion.

14:57.050 --> 14:59.260
Power of you ain't take
a shower in three days,

14:59.261 --> 15:00.969
that might be why you're scratching.

15:00.970 --> 15:02.513
What you care?

15:02.514 --> 15:06.850
Poor personal hygiene can
be a sign of depression.

15:06.851 --> 15:09.019
Man, I ain't depressed.

15:09.020 --> 15:10.396
- Oh.
- [Taystee chuckles]

15:10.397 --> 15:13.274
The line's been long in the showers
since it started getting hot,

15:13.275 --> 15:17.445
but I been washing my pits, tits
and naughty bits in the sink.

15:17.446 --> 15:18.737
Well, thank you for that.

15:18.738 --> 15:21.574
Look, you don't wanna be forced
to take a shower like Asia Girl,

15:21.575 --> 15:25.035
don't get so ripe you go rotten.
All I'm saying.

15:25.036 --> 15:28.664
Okay, maybe you got a point...
but it ain't bugs.

15:28.665 --> 15:30.241
- [sniffs]
- Man, come on, man.

15:31.835 --> 15:33.461
Uh-uh!

15:33.462 --> 15:35.963
Forrest Gump... seat's taken.

15:35.964 --> 15:38.382
Yeah... blackies only.

15:38.383 --> 15:41.635
But I got just as much of a
right to this seat as you do.

15:41.636 --> 15:44.347
I mean, this place is full today...

15:44.348 --> 15:46.515
- and you're discriminating me.
- Yes.

15:46.516 --> 15:49.643
Rosa Parks could walk through
that door, but she got bedbugs...

15:49.644 --> 15:53.146
bitch, her ass going to the
back of the bus same as you.

15:53.147 --> 15:55.358
Who's gonna stop me, though...

15:55.359 --> 15:57.610
now that your big-haired mammy's in hell,

15:57.611 --> 16:00.821
takin' Satan's three-pronged
penis up her butt?

16:00.822 --> 16:01.989
[screaming]

16:01.990 --> 16:03.491
- [Taystee] No!
- [Bell] Warren!

16:03.492 --> 16:06.285
- [Janae] Man, chill out.
- Do I need to write you a shot?

16:06.286 --> 16:07.953
No, no, no, no, no. She's good.

16:07.954 --> 16:10.373
She just had a little too much spicy.
That's all.

16:10.374 --> 16:12.541
Give me the potato... now.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.327
Give me the potato.

16:14.961 --> 16:17.170
I got you. You good.

16:17.171 --> 16:18.964
- Yes.
- Sit down.

16:18.965 --> 16:20.924
We good, Suzanne. We good.

16:20.925 --> 16:23.176
- [Crazy Eyes] We good.
- [Taystee] We good, Officer Bell.

16:23.177 --> 16:24.463
We...

16:25.889 --> 16:28.891
- I will potato her at a future time.
- [whispering] I know.

16:28.892 --> 16:33.012
Get your lunch to go, Doggett.
We got van duty.

16:33.605 --> 16:34.889
[Crazy Eyes chuckles]

16:35.649 --> 16:37.016
Bitch, bye.

16:38.777 --> 16:39.985
You not hungry?

16:39.986 --> 16:42.522
I'm not standing in that
parade of tits and ass.

16:43.323 --> 16:45.991
You secretly love this.

16:45.992 --> 16:47.993
Some things are better left mysteries.

16:47.994 --> 16:49.995
Do you wanna borrow my paper bottoms?

16:49.996 --> 16:52.290
Because I could rip them off
and just give them to you.

16:52.291 --> 16:54.375
Come on.

16:54.376 --> 16:56.202
Give mama a smile!

16:57.671 --> 17:00.298
[chuckles] Do you remember
what Kubra used to say?

17:00.299 --> 17:01.382
Uh-uh.

17:01.383 --> 17:03.426
"A smile is like tight underwear.

17:03.427 --> 17:06.045
- It lifts your cheeks."
- "It lifts your cheeks."

17:06.805 --> 17:09.138
[chuckles] He's gonna kill me, you know.

17:09.140 --> 17:11.718
- Alex...
- [inhales]

17:12.644 --> 17:16.814
I really thought they
would put him away...

17:16.815 --> 17:18.642
and I'd be out...

17:21.736 --> 17:25.406
Fuck, I'm fucking suffocating.
[groans]

17:25.406 --> 17:28.617
Alex, you will survive
because it's what you do.

17:28.618 --> 17:31.454
Yeah... like a cockroach.

17:31.455 --> 17:33.831
Maybe that's your spirit animal.

17:33.832 --> 17:35.833
[laughs] I know that you're
trying to make me feel better,

17:35.834 --> 17:37.918
but really think about
what you just said to me.

17:37.919 --> 17:39.587
You know, they really get a bad rap.

17:39.588 --> 17:42.340
They were the first animals
to ever mate in space.

17:42.341 --> 17:45.884
They live in tight colonies because
they just love being touched

17:45.885 --> 17:50.173
and they can carry cigarettes.
They're bad bitches.

17:52.058 --> 17:54.302
I can't be here right now.

17:55.770 --> 17:58.481
[Nicky] I mean, seriously,
what the fuck is going on?

17:58.482 --> 18:01.734
Man, it's like six early
releases this month.

18:01.735 --> 18:02.818
Yeah,

18:02.819 --> 18:06.947
bullshit sentences for minor drug crimes
just aren't enforced like they used to be.

18:06.948 --> 18:09.400
Speaking of minor drug crimes...

18:09.826 --> 18:11.827
Our smack scheme is no minor offense.

18:11.828 --> 18:14.955
Really? You couldn't come up with
a code word or something for that?

18:14.956 --> 18:16.248
Fine.

18:16.249 --> 18:17.916
Getting caught with that many Jujubes

18:17.917 --> 18:20.293
will get our candy asses kicked
down to max for a decade.

18:20.294 --> 18:23.255
No, we have come too close
for you to puss out on me now.

18:23.256 --> 18:25.924
I will smother you in your sleep.

18:25.925 --> 18:28.344
Red concreted our shipping route.

18:28.345 --> 18:30.095
All the coke kitties are getting out,

18:30.096 --> 18:33.766
and maybe, like, the universe is
just trying to send us a message.

18:33.767 --> 18:35.308
Bitch, please.

18:35.309 --> 18:37.520
All those girls had no time
left on their sentences.

18:37.521 --> 18:38.937
That just ain't you or me, huh?

18:38.938 --> 18:40.022
[man on PA] Escort to infirmary.

18:40.023 --> 18:42.315
- [scoffs]
- Escort to infirmary.

18:42.316 --> 18:44.985
We need the right Oompa Loompa
to smuggle our sweets out of here.

18:44.986 --> 18:48.607
You know what? Now you're
just abusing the metaphor.

18:49.323 --> 18:51.074
This is the last of it...

18:51.075 --> 18:54.161
and if you ask me, this oatmeal
should be for breakfast, not voodoo.

18:54.162 --> 18:55.538
It's not abracadabra.

18:55.539 --> 18:58.206
It's nature's anti-itch cream.
It's medicine.

18:58.207 --> 19:00.709
So why you making it
and not the infirmary?

19:00.710 --> 19:02.370
Good fucking question. Dame.

19:07.050 --> 19:08.960
[softly] Fuck.

19:13.473 --> 19:15.933
Inmate, there've been
complaints about moldy rice.

19:15.934 --> 19:17.734
I need you to show me
where you store it.

19:26.027 --> 19:28.487
The fuck is this? An intervention?

19:28.488 --> 19:30.906
What were you doing
talking to Mendez's mother?

19:30.907 --> 19:33.200
We're mutually-concerned grandparents.

19:33.201 --> 19:34.827
She's not the grandmother.

19:34.828 --> 19:36.328
- She might be.
- What is that supposed to mean?

19:36.329 --> 19:38.456
That's for me and my
daughter to talk about.

19:38.457 --> 19:40.123
- He's part of this.
- Yeah, I am.

19:40.124 --> 19:41.367
Yeah?

19:42.794 --> 19:44.746
Okay, fine.

19:46.506 --> 19:48.424
- She wants to adopt the baby.
- What?

19:48.425 --> 19:49.668
Shh!

19:50.469 --> 19:52.428
- Your job right now is to listen.
- [Bennett] To what?

19:52.429 --> 19:54.597
The only thing worse than
Mendez raising that baby

19:54.598 --> 19:56.432
- is his mother doing it.
- Mmm-hmm.

19:56.433 --> 20:00.185
That's what I said... but it turns
out she got two other kids.

20:00.186 --> 20:02.312
One's a tooth doctor,
the other's an artist,

20:02.313 --> 20:03.522
and they turned out real good.

20:03.523 --> 20:06.984
- I'm not giving up my baby to nobody.
- That's also what I said...

20:06.985 --> 20:09.152
but then she made some real good points.

20:09.153 --> 20:10.571
- No, nothing she...
- Shh!

20:10.572 --> 20:11.856
[Bennett sighs]

20:13.032 --> 20:17.453
Daya... you got 37 months
left on your sentence.

20:17.454 --> 20:19.580
He can't do nothing or
he'll go to jail, too.

20:19.581 --> 20:23.910
Abuela is too old and Cesar's
guaranteed to fuck up.

20:25.336 --> 20:28.539
- You remember your year in foster care?
- [sighs]

20:29.382 --> 20:30.549
You want that for the baby?

20:30.550 --> 20:33.586
- That's not going to happen.
- Shh! Let her finish.

20:35.221 --> 20:37.097
You're not actually
considering this, are you?

20:37.098 --> 20:38.474
Aren't you?

20:38.475 --> 20:42.102
I'm not saying yes. It
just kind of makes sense.

20:42.103 --> 20:43.687
[Bennett] Except for the part
where the woman

20:43.688 --> 20:47.816
who raised a drug-dealing rapist
named Pornstache adopts our child.

20:47.817 --> 20:48.984
[sighs]

20:48.985 --> 20:51.194
Have you ever even held a baby?

20:51.195 --> 20:52.563
Changed a diaper?

20:53.281 --> 20:57.075
You wanna make that kid live in a
shithole with five other people?

20:57.076 --> 20:59.237
He can have his own bedroom.

21:01.080 --> 21:05.083
Did you ever spend the night
in a room by yourself?

21:05.084 --> 21:07.795
That baby could have a real life...

21:07.796 --> 21:09.838
with money...

21:09.839 --> 21:12.925
and clean towels and shit.

21:12.926 --> 21:16.595
Look, Daya and I are happy, okay?

21:16.596 --> 21:19.090
You don't need towels for that.

21:22.727 --> 21:24.137
Right?

21:25.772 --> 21:27.431
[pop music playing]

21:28.149 --> 21:29.683
[soldiers cheering]

21:59.931 --> 22:02.349
God damn it, Farzad!

22:02.350 --> 22:05.227
Look, it's only funny because
the dudes are dancing.

22:05.228 --> 22:07.771
Not her. Understand?

22:07.772 --> 22:09.265
No.

22:10.524 --> 22:11.859
Jesus.

22:11.860 --> 22:14.903
Can somebody please get me
a better Muslim over here?

22:14.904 --> 22:18.441
Let's try this again in five, ladies.

22:28.584 --> 22:29.918
Don't sweat it, man.

22:29.919 --> 22:31.996
This is just how Americans
like to waste time.

22:33.589 --> 22:35.340
Bad work?

22:35.341 --> 22:37.300
You were bad at being stupid.

22:37.301 --> 22:38.920
That is a good thing.

22:40.471 --> 22:42.798
You did good. You did good.

22:46.728 --> 22:49.055
What's wrong with them?

22:50.231 --> 22:51.640
Them, uh...

22:53.109 --> 22:56.395
You all, uh... boy-kiss-boy.

22:57.405 --> 22:58.898
Fuck! This motherfucker...

23:00.158 --> 23:01.825
Yeah, I see that.

23:01.826 --> 23:04.828
Ugh, it's like ironic divine retribution.

23:04.829 --> 23:07.247
We're stuck in our own spin cycle.

23:07.248 --> 23:11.001
This paper suit keeps
sticking to my sweaty parts.

23:11.002 --> 23:14.629
Once, when my mother forgot
to buy me a Halloween costume,

23:14.630 --> 23:16.674
she taped a bunch of old newspapers to me

23:16.675 --> 23:18.676
and said I should tell people
I was a newsstand.

23:18.677 --> 23:20.879
[gasps] You know what we need?

23:21.721 --> 23:23.638
Bean leaves.

23:23.639 --> 23:26.433
I got bedbugs at a sit-in for
a Portland homeless shelter.

23:26.434 --> 23:27.810
The conditions were appalling.

23:27.811 --> 23:30.721
So we used bean leaves to trap
the bedbugs and get rid of them.

23:31.439 --> 23:33.141
I didn't know beans grew on leaves.

23:34.025 --> 23:35.608
Oh, yeah, take it off.

23:35.609 --> 23:39.612
Ooh! Excuse me, Mr. Luschek.

23:39.613 --> 23:42.908
We would like to make a formal
petition for some bean leaves.

23:42.909 --> 23:45.118
[Angie] And maybe some extra washers.

23:45.119 --> 23:46.787
People or machines, either one.

23:46.788 --> 23:48.872
- But really, bean leaves.
- [slams door]

23:48.873 --> 23:52.918
If you say "bean leaves" one more time,
I'm going to punch you in the fuck hole.

23:52.919 --> 23:54.328
One of the fuck holes.

23:55.463 --> 23:57.965
How 'bout some fans instead?

23:57.966 --> 23:59.667
At least two of them work.

24:01.594 --> 24:02.677
All yours.

24:02.678 --> 24:04.387
Aye, aye, Captain.

24:04.388 --> 24:07.140
Yeah, I wouldn't want to
see you strain your ass,

24:07.141 --> 24:08.851
you know, sitting on that table.

24:08.852 --> 24:11.686
I could probably think of a witty
comeback if it wasn't so hot in here...

24:11.687 --> 24:13.355
or I cared.

24:13.356 --> 24:17.442
Hey, I hope you're not down here
for any of that girl faggot shit.

24:17.443 --> 24:20.028
Well, when you talk dirty
to me like that...

24:20.029 --> 24:22.697
Yeah, I know you've been
sniffing around Angie's tree.

24:22.698 --> 24:23.782
And you should know

24:23.783 --> 24:26.744
the only soggy box that
interests me is mine,

24:26.745 --> 24:31.874
and all that goes in it
are dicks and tampons...

24:31.875 --> 24:35.002
and sometimes other things,
but only guys can put those in.

24:35.003 --> 24:36.211
Noted.

24:36.212 --> 24:38.839
Although, when you
call it your soggy box,

24:38.840 --> 24:41.216
you know, it makes it
really hard to resist.

24:41.217 --> 24:45.137
Hey, how come all the guards
get to wear real clothes?

24:45.138 --> 24:46.263
We're exempt.

24:46.264 --> 24:47.931
Do the bedbugs know that?

24:47.932 --> 24:49.767
You wash our uniforms every day.

24:49.768 --> 24:51.177
[chuckling]

24:52.854 --> 24:54.347
Shit!

25:03.697 --> 25:06.442
Whoa! Whoa! Luschek!

25:07.160 --> 25:08.960
It's like undressing in front of my dog.

25:09.537 --> 25:12.781
I need you to wash these right now.

25:13.499 --> 25:15.368
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

25:22.967 --> 25:25.628
Sleepy-time tea.

25:34.020 --> 25:36.729
♪ A little spray here
A little spray there ♪

25:36.730 --> 25:39.357
♪ Ooh, little spray in my underwear ♪

25:39.358 --> 25:41.734
♪ Makes the buggies back off ♪

25:41.735 --> 25:44.779
♪ Ooh, makes the buggies piss off ♪

25:44.780 --> 25:47.532
♪ Makes the buggies back
way the fuck Tssh! Tssh! ♪

25:47.533 --> 25:49.242
♪ Way the fuck off ♪

25:49.243 --> 25:50.911
[vocalizing]

25:50.912 --> 25:54.289
This is, like, the Titanic of bad ideas.

25:54.290 --> 25:56.291
Like, we're steerin'
out the way of bedbugs

25:56.292 --> 25:59.794
and crashin' into an iceberg
of chemical burns and shit.

25:59.795 --> 26:03.332
[scoffs] Please. My Grammy used
to douche with disinfectant.

26:04.050 --> 26:06.468
- The trick is to imagine the bugs...
- Lybol?

26:06.469 --> 26:07.719
...being bugged by you.

26:07.720 --> 26:10.848
You can't give away your power.

26:10.849 --> 26:13.016
Like you almost did at lunch?

26:13.017 --> 26:17.062
Look, you can't be getting' all crazy
every time that somebody talks about Vee.

26:17.063 --> 26:19.314
But did you hear that slattern?

26:19.315 --> 26:22.234
Look, that business about a
tri-penis, unacceptable.

26:22.235 --> 26:27.530
That warrants... a severe response.

26:27.531 --> 26:30.700
Man, you fuck up an ofay with
a spork, you angry enough.

26:30.701 --> 26:33.871
No, Vee would have defended
me if vice were versa.

26:33.872 --> 26:37.290
Okay, even if that was true,
which it definitely is not,

26:37.291 --> 26:41.920
you're one shot away from being a
puddle of black drool in the psych.

26:41.921 --> 26:44.172
- You need to check yourself.
- [Alex coughing]

26:44.173 --> 26:45.590
- Back off.
- Did you mean...

26:45.591 --> 26:47.968
- [coughing]
- ...to spray that on your skin?

26:47.969 --> 26:49.177
Yes.

26:49.178 --> 26:53.473
Because in general, when a bottle
reads "caution" and "warning,"

26:53.474 --> 26:56.518
it might not be the best idea.

26:56.519 --> 26:58.311
Man, see?

26:58.312 --> 27:00.022
I knew this was a bad idea,

27:00.023 --> 27:03.816
you telling me to clean
with your grandma's douche.

27:03.817 --> 27:06.569
Someone's grandma
douches with disinfectant?

27:06.570 --> 27:09.656
Man, this was the pill
before there was a pill.

27:09.657 --> 27:11.241
It's cheaper than condoms

27:11.242 --> 27:13.994
and make your coochie crack
smell like lemon fresh.

27:13.995 --> 27:16.163
I'm for real. Look that shit up.

27:16.164 --> 27:20.708
It couldn't have worked too well
because, you know, well, you're here.

27:20.709 --> 27:22.002
Man, uh...

27:22.003 --> 27:24.462
When did our bathroom become gentrified?

27:24.463 --> 27:28.008
Since the Spanish became
patient zero for bedbugs.

27:28.009 --> 27:29.301
[Crazy Eyes] Mmm.

27:29.302 --> 27:31.344
This isn't social hour, ladies.

27:31.345 --> 27:34.173
Unless you're working, out.
Everybody out.

27:36.184 --> 27:37.976
I gave you an order, inmate.

27:37.977 --> 27:40.395
I...

27:40.396 --> 27:43.891
I need permission to use the toilet?

27:44.775 --> 27:47.444
- May I relieve myself, teacher?
- Excuse me?

27:47.445 --> 27:48.736
- Alex...
- That's a shot.

27:48.737 --> 27:50.322
[Alex] What?

27:50.323 --> 27:52.824
There are girls spraying
themselves with disinfectant

27:52.825 --> 27:55.077
because this prison is swarming with bugs,

27:55.078 --> 27:57.412
but pissing is a violation?

27:57.413 --> 28:00.082
Great. I'm glad you have
your priorities straight.

28:00.083 --> 28:02.667
- Where are the fucking fumigators?
- Lower your voice, inmate.

28:02.668 --> 28:05.795
Are they too worried to kill the bedbugs
because they'll kill the cockroaches, too?

28:05.796 --> 28:07.796
- Are you calling me a cockroach?
- It's okay.

28:08.132 --> 28:09.591
They get a bad rap.

28:09.592 --> 28:10.800
Alex.

28:10.801 --> 28:12.219
You're going to seg, inmate.

28:12.220 --> 28:14.012
Alex! No, no, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:14.013 --> 28:15.097
You know that this isn't her.

28:15.098 --> 28:17.182
She's just back here
after having been out.

28:17.183 --> 28:20.978
- You want a shot, too, Chapman?
- Will it keep her out of SHU?

28:20.979 --> 28:23.181
Please. Come on.

28:24.065 --> 28:26.483
Hey, haven't you ever had a bad day?

28:26.484 --> 28:31.647
Like, a... really... really bad day?

28:34.492 --> 28:38.996
Disobeying a staff member,
insolence to a staff member.

28:38.997 --> 28:41.157
That's two shots, Vause.

28:48.881 --> 28:50.208
- [sobbing softly]
- Alex.

28:51.217 --> 28:53.461
How am I back here, Piper?

28:56.472 --> 29:00.551
How could I let myself get back here?

29:04.522 --> 29:07.808
Alex, it's not your fault.

29:08.985 --> 29:11.061
And they call me crazy.

29:18.786 --> 29:20.904
[inhales]

29:41.892 --> 29:42.975
[softly] Oh, my God!

29:42.976 --> 29:45.638
We will probably never be rich...

29:46.480 --> 29:48.856
and we'll most likely live in
a place that's not that big,

29:48.857 --> 29:52.102
but we'll work hard and we'll
love each other and...

29:52.903 --> 29:56.198
we'll find so much happiness that we
won't even know what to do with it.

29:56.199 --> 29:58.450
We'll share it with our kid.

29:58.451 --> 30:00.493
Our kids.

30:00.494 --> 30:01.904
[breathes deeply]

30:04.457 --> 30:06.617
Will you marry me?

30:07.293 --> 30:08.494
[chuckles]

30:10.254 --> 30:12.748
The ring is temporary.

30:15.134 --> 30:17.753
- Uh... my leg. [chuckles]
- Okay.

30:27.563 --> 30:29.981
I love you so much.

30:29.982 --> 30:32.067
We still gotta be careful...

30:32.068 --> 30:33.936
for now.

30:40.284 --> 30:44.162
Hey, you know, I think you need to be
in an enclosed space for that to work.

30:44.163 --> 30:45.288
[sighs]

30:45.289 --> 30:48.040
I'm blasting the heater to
kill any bedbugs inside.

30:48.041 --> 30:50.953
Hey, Luschek, let me ask you a question.

30:52.255 --> 30:53.956
You like candy, right?

30:54.757 --> 30:56.383
Body by Butterfinger.

30:56.384 --> 30:58.426
I'm speaking allegorically here.

30:58.427 --> 31:00.087
You wanna talk about Al Gore?

31:00.804 --> 31:02.430
Oh, Jesus.

31:02.431 --> 31:06.434
Okay. [chuckles] Hey,
listen, all right? Focus.

31:06.435 --> 31:11.439
Let's say I happen to have a
Costco-sized box of candy, right?

31:11.440 --> 31:15.568
And I... I fuckin' love candy,
but I can't eat it anymore

31:15.569 --> 31:18.780
because, you know, it ruined
my life, it gave me cavities,

31:18.781 --> 31:21.283
I am in Candy Eaters Anonymous now, eh?

31:21.284 --> 31:24.744
So I gotta get rid of it, yeah?

31:24.745 --> 31:27.406
Like, out-of-the-prison rid of it.

31:32.420 --> 31:34.913
I've got a shit-ton of
heroin I need you to sell.

31:36.048 --> 31:40.260
- Are you out of your mind, inmate?
- [chuckling] Hey.

31:40.261 --> 31:41.886
You're asking me to sell narcotics?

31:41.887 --> 31:44.382
I'm a Federal Corrections Officer.

31:45.098 --> 31:46.724
All right, let's go.

31:46.725 --> 31:48.935
- We're gonna go to Caputo's office...
- No!

31:48.936 --> 31:51.604
...you're gonna tell him
exactly what you told me,

31:51.605 --> 31:53.440
every word, even that
weird Al Gore thing.

31:53.441 --> 31:55.775
Okay, look, Luschek, you must've
misunderstood me, all right?

31:55.776 --> 31:57.109
[Nicky panting]

31:57.110 --> 31:58.896
I'm fucking with you.

32:00.239 --> 32:01.323
Of course I'll sell it.

32:01.324 --> 32:04.409
Oh, my God. Jesus.

32:04.410 --> 32:07.119
Man, come on. You know
I got a bad heart.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.080
You can't do that shit to me, man.

32:09.081 --> 32:11.583
I want, uh... 80%.

32:11.584 --> 32:13.076
Of the drugs or the money?

32:17.923 --> 32:19.841
You're not supposed to be back here.

32:19.842 --> 32:22.051
Yeah, I know, but I got this.

32:22.052 --> 32:23.345
- You slept with it?
- Yeah.

32:23.346 --> 32:24.637
- Said the Lord's Prayer?
- Mmm-hmm.

32:24.638 --> 32:27.139
Okay, good. Evil eye is off of you.

32:27.140 --> 32:29.176
Don't you gotta break it or some shit?

32:30.143 --> 32:31.394
I'll break it in the
morning when I cook it.

32:31.395 --> 32:32.479
What?

32:32.480 --> 32:35.273
But you can't feed somebody my problems!
What... what if I eat it back?

32:35.274 --> 32:36.358
You as likely to eat

32:36.359 --> 32:38.651
somebody's hormone imbalance,
cheating husband or diarrhea.

32:38.652 --> 32:39.902
- Listen...
- [Poussey sighs]

32:39.903 --> 32:41.783
...if it makes you
nervous, skip breakfast.

32:42.490 --> 32:45.533
That ain't right, yo. I'm trying here.

32:45.534 --> 32:48.119
Well, I had to use all the
oatmeal on people's itches

32:48.120 --> 32:49.829
which means that more
people are eating eggs

32:49.830 --> 32:52.700
which means that your egg...
gets cooked.

32:54.210 --> 32:55.453
[sighs]

33:08.432 --> 33:09.633
[softly] Thanks.

33:14.688 --> 33:17.433
I'm literally garbage. [chuckles]

33:18.817 --> 33:21.736
I think I'm having a nervous breakdown.

33:21.737 --> 33:23.655
Oh, chin up, kibun.

33:23.656 --> 33:26.108
You'll think of the right lie.

33:27.868 --> 33:29.236
What was that about?

33:29.745 --> 33:32.789
I told her that her restaurant
was a booming success.

33:32.790 --> 33:33.873
And?

33:33.874 --> 33:36.167
And it has been shuttered for months.

33:36.168 --> 33:37.460
Mmm.

33:37.461 --> 33:38.545
That's fucked up.

33:38.546 --> 33:40.338
I was trying to be nice.

33:40.339 --> 33:42.924
She was so happy when I lied.

33:42.925 --> 33:44.842
Delusion can be very comforting.

33:44.843 --> 33:46.462
Right?

33:47.388 --> 33:49.889
The best part of my time here

33:49.890 --> 33:54.269
was when I thought somebody else
had named me as a co-conspirator.

33:54.270 --> 33:57.146
It was like...

33:57.147 --> 34:01.318
the universe had just
brought us back together.

34:01.319 --> 34:04.362
And then you realized that I
was the asshole who named you.

34:04.363 --> 34:06.323
No.

34:06.324 --> 34:09.951
I mean, yes, you did and that sucked...

34:09.952 --> 34:11.319
but...

34:13.789 --> 34:17.951
for a while, ignorance was... bliss.

34:24.382 --> 34:26.884
Getting all of our shit out on the table,

34:26.885 --> 34:31.054
being totally, brutally honest about
all the fucked-up things we've done,

34:31.056 --> 34:33.725
and then deciding to
still like each other,

34:33.726 --> 34:36.219
that is an amazing thing.

34:37.480 --> 34:40.974
Resiliency of the human
spirit and all of that.

34:42.485 --> 34:44.937
So much better than ignorance.

34:47.239 --> 34:48.774
Seriously.

34:51.034 --> 34:52.652
What?

34:54.246 --> 34:55.947
What is it, Piper?

34:57.958 --> 35:00.460
I, um...

35:00.461 --> 35:03.170
had a friend...

35:03.171 --> 35:05.673
call...

35:05.674 --> 35:07.091
Davy Crockett

35:07.092 --> 35:10.838
and tell him that you had
violated your parole.

35:13.641 --> 35:16.093
You called...

35:19.062 --> 35:20.688
my probation officer?

35:20.689 --> 35:22.565
You kept saying that you were in danger.

35:22.566 --> 35:24.108
- Bullshit.
- And I was just trying to protect you.

35:24.109 --> 35:25.693
That is bullshit and you know it.

35:25.694 --> 35:27.404
Just more bullshit!

35:27.405 --> 35:31.323
I'm so, so, so, so sorry...

35:31.324 --> 35:37.121
but now, see, all of our shit...
is just right out on the table

35:37.122 --> 35:38.540
and we can decide to like each other...

35:38.541 --> 35:41.125
You're a fucking psycho!

35:41.126 --> 35:43.836
...and you can stop blaming
yourself for being in here.

35:43.837 --> 35:46.088
And start blaming you?

35:46.089 --> 35:48.299
Because that's what I'm
supposed to do now, right?

35:48.300 --> 35:52.136
So you can keep control
over whatever this is.

35:52.137 --> 35:55.432
Control? Alex, you were
having a nervous breakdown.

35:55.433 --> 35:57.300
Which wasn't hot for you, was it?

35:59.520 --> 36:02.063
Depressives are bummer fuck-buddies.

36:02.064 --> 36:04.307
Can't have that.

36:07.778 --> 36:12.149
God, you're such a manipulative cunt!

36:18.914 --> 36:21.366
You're gonna have to burn 'em.

36:22.793 --> 36:26.087
We're not burning any books.
This is not Nuremberg.

36:26.088 --> 36:30.216
And I'm not that kind of
exterminator, but facts is facts.

36:30.217 --> 36:32.510
Am I allowed to interact with them?

36:32.511 --> 36:34.846
They are people. Yeah.

36:34.847 --> 36:36.965
[Dan] Can I see a couple of those?

36:38.391 --> 36:41.644
Yeah, that's Rats of NIMH.
It's, like, my top five.

36:41.645 --> 36:44.105
I cried like a baby when Jenner died.
You can't burn that.

36:44.106 --> 36:46.858
Man, this broke-ass prison
will never replace 'em.

36:46.859 --> 36:48.860
- You can't do this.
- Calm down.

36:48.861 --> 36:51.403
We're not replacing any books
'cause we're not losing any.

36:51.404 --> 36:53.565
Isn't that right, Dan?

36:54.492 --> 36:56.075
- Bedbug.
- [Poussey] What?

36:56.076 --> 36:58.578
Man, that ain't no bedbug.

36:58.579 --> 37:00.246
That's a muffin crumb.

37:00.247 --> 37:02.248
Well, how you gonna tell
the expert what that is?

37:02.249 --> 37:04.584
Ain't like I'm not an expert at muffins.

37:04.585 --> 37:06.418
The thing about these
bastards is once they're in,

37:06.419 --> 37:09.255
the only way to get 'em out is to
wipe out their nooks and crannies.

37:09.256 --> 37:11.138
[Poussey] You can't just
spray some stuff in here?

37:11.139 --> 37:12.258
Steam the books or something?

37:12.259 --> 37:14.502
I'm telling you, it ain't a bedbug.

37:15.220 --> 37:17.005
What you think, Mr. Caputo?

37:22.936 --> 37:24.395
You're 100% sure?

37:24.396 --> 37:25.605
75%.

37:25.606 --> 37:27.649
How sure are you that
that's a muffin crumb?

37:27.650 --> 37:29.651
- Like, 90%.
- Oh?

37:29.652 --> 37:31.186
Well, that wins out.

37:33.531 --> 37:34.656
You wanna be sure?

37:34.657 --> 37:36.491
Have at it.

37:36.492 --> 37:38.276
[scoffs]

37:39.202 --> 37:40.779
- Jefferson...
- T...

37:42.956 --> 37:44.532
You didn't! Jesus.

37:45.333 --> 37:48.453
I'm down to, like, 50-50.

37:49.797 --> 37:51.414
[whispers] Shit.

37:53.759 --> 37:55.293
Who are you?

37:55.928 --> 37:59.589
Uh, sorry, I'm looking for Cesar.

38:01.183 --> 38:02.559
- Cesar!
- [Cesar] What?

38:02.560 --> 38:04.052
Some white boy here.

38:07.022 --> 38:08.265
Baby daddy!

38:08.982 --> 38:11.400
Que pasó? Daya and Aleida okay?

38:11.401 --> 38:14.529
Yeah. Yeah, no, great. I, um...

38:14.530 --> 38:17.907
You said to stop by sometime,
so here I am. [chuckles]

38:17.908 --> 38:22.244
Also, I brought this gift for Lucy.

38:22.245 --> 38:26.248
And, uh... I proposed to Daya, actually.

38:26.249 --> 38:27.750
No fucking way!

38:27.751 --> 38:29.460
Get in here!

38:29.461 --> 38:32.421
Homeboy stepping up to the plate!

38:32.422 --> 38:34.340
[speaking Spanish]

38:34.341 --> 38:36.383
Margarita, listen to this.

38:36.384 --> 38:39.345
How'd you do it? Did you get her a ring?

38:39.346 --> 38:42.932
Uh, I made it, actually,
out of... gum wrappers.

38:42.933 --> 38:44.266
Gum was how we met, so...

38:44.267 --> 38:46.185
Babe. Babe!

38:46.186 --> 38:48.187
What's up?

38:48.188 --> 38:49.597
Dinner!

38:52.776 --> 38:54.694
Dude, you need to get her a real ring.

38:54.695 --> 38:57.154
Yeah, no, definitely. I just, um...

38:57.155 --> 38:58.615
I mean, she can't have
it in prison, though,

38:58.616 --> 39:01.283
'cause she'll get, you
know, shanked for it.

39:01.284 --> 39:04.161
My boss will ask me
where she got it, or...

39:04.162 --> 39:07.615
But... [clears throat] I think
the gum ring is fine for now.

39:09.417 --> 39:11.787
Hey, who's... [whispering] who's that?

39:12.588 --> 39:15.623
I'm a daddy again!

39:16.592 --> 39:20.052
And I know you ain't gonna
say shit to Aleida, right?

39:20.053 --> 39:24.724
Or do I have to bribe you with, like,
movies and candies like I do with them?

39:24.725 --> 39:26.051
[chuckles]

39:26.727 --> 39:28.185
- [Eva grunts]
- How many times...

39:28.186 --> 39:29.646
Look! Look what you did.

39:29.647 --> 39:31.181
You broke this shit!

39:33.609 --> 39:35.818
Hi. You're Lucy, right?

39:35.819 --> 39:37.520
I'm Lucy.

39:38.196 --> 39:40.858
Oh, sorry.

39:52.002 --> 39:53.127
[sighs]

39:53.128 --> 39:55.630
[in a funny voice] Happy birthday!
[chuckles]

39:55.631 --> 39:57.339
[in normal voice]
Dayanara asked me to bring you this.

39:57.340 --> 39:59.001
Is it a Barbie?

39:59.802 --> 40:02.679
Well, I guess you'll have
to open it and find out.

40:02.680 --> 40:06.383
No, it's not a Barbie, but it's cool.

40:07.142 --> 40:09.060
Dinner, bitches.

40:09.061 --> 40:10.227
That was fast.

40:10.228 --> 40:13.105
Yeah, leftovers from Storky's.

40:13.106 --> 40:14.816
Hey, I should probably get going.

40:14.817 --> 40:17.810
I just wanted to drop off the
thing and tell you the good news.

40:18.278 --> 40:21.398
Nice try, homeboy.
You're staying for dinner.

40:29.206 --> 40:30.873
Oh, Mitch, good to see you.

40:30.874 --> 40:33.334
[Mitch] Wish it were under
better circumstances.

40:33.335 --> 40:35.753
Yeah, well, could be worse.

40:35.754 --> 40:37.588
Fig could still be here.

40:37.589 --> 40:39.582
I really liked her.

40:41.719 --> 40:46.222
[clears throat] The early releases
should have saved you enough money

40:46.223 --> 40:50.142
to handle the infestation situation
without any additional funding.

40:50.143 --> 40:53.354
I've made several
cost-cutting measures myself,

40:53.355 --> 40:55.106
and that includes the new mattresses

40:55.107 --> 40:57.316
which I noticed weren't
factored into your budget.

40:57.317 --> 40:58.735
Because they weren't approved.

40:58.736 --> 41:00.695
They were approved. They have to be.

41:00.696 --> 41:02.529
We're burning 'em right now, Mitch.

41:02.530 --> 41:04.615
Burning, yes, fine.

41:04.616 --> 41:07.618
But we're not going to replace
hundreds of mattresses

41:07.619 --> 41:10.072
only to get rid of them
again in two months.

41:11.874 --> 41:14.659
Why would we get rid of the
mattresses in two months?

41:18.338 --> 41:19.664
No one told you.

41:22.425 --> 41:24.377
Holy shit.

41:26.013 --> 41:29.091
Holy shit!

41:30.976 --> 41:32.935
[sighs]

41:32.936 --> 41:35.646
That's the reason for
the early releases.

41:35.647 --> 41:37.439
I'm sorry.

41:37.440 --> 41:39.275
I don't know how you weren't informed.

41:39.276 --> 41:43.521
The warden must've forgot to ring
me in between rounds of golf.

41:45.282 --> 41:47.616
None of this reflects badly on you.

41:47.617 --> 41:52.079
Your name is actually being
mentioned quite favorably.

41:52.080 --> 41:55.158
There's a good chance
you'll get a transfer.

41:57.669 --> 41:59.162
And everybody else?

42:07.137 --> 42:08.838
How long do we have?

42:09.222 --> 42:12.092
The prisoners should all
be relocated by the 20th.

42:13.351 --> 42:16.513
They're officially closing
the prison the 30th.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.783
Eat your French fries, puto.

42:28.784 --> 42:30.910
I'm not hungry for vegetables.

42:30.911 --> 42:32.036
- Hey!
- [Margarita] Oh!

42:32.037 --> 42:33.537
Pero listen to you.

42:33.538 --> 42:36.491
Don't you talk to him that way.
He pays your rent.

42:37.292 --> 42:40.294
That's right. So you gotta
listen to what I say

42:40.295 --> 42:44.924
because otherwise, there'll
be behavioral consequences.

42:44.925 --> 42:47.551
Man, when you put 'em in the
microwave, they get disgusting!

42:47.552 --> 42:48.878
I'm not eating 'em.

42:54.309 --> 42:56.560
- [gun cocks]
- Whoa! Hey, now! Hey! Whoa.

42:56.561 --> 42:58.938
Margarita brought you French fries.

42:58.939 --> 43:02.225
You better get fuckin' hungry real quick.

43:09.199 --> 43:10.741
Emiliano, do me a favor.

43:10.742 --> 43:13.486
Get the fuck out of my face.

43:18.917 --> 43:20.877
I know I look strict, right?

43:20.878 --> 43:22.962
But secretly, deep down inside,

43:22.963 --> 43:26.048
they're just happy that there's
actually an adult in charge.

43:26.049 --> 43:29.001
- Sit down, sit down. Eat, eat.
- [exhales]

43:32.514 --> 43:34.598
[man on radio]
Impact target 30 seconds from flash.

43:34.599 --> 43:38.477
Repeat. Impact target
is 30 seconds from flash.

43:38.478 --> 43:41.313
Not a bad first combat tour, huh, Bennett?

43:41.314 --> 43:43.649
Yeah, cleaning porta-johns
and dancing like a rent boy

43:43.650 --> 43:45.484
while Skynet does all the fun stuff.

43:45.485 --> 43:46.777
Aw, come on now.

43:46.778 --> 43:48.404
You know the biggest
bombs in the whole war

43:48.405 --> 43:49.530
get dropped in the porta-johns.

43:49.531 --> 43:52.449
Ha-ha. Yeah, maybe I'll get a medal
for most excellent shit-soldier.

43:52.450 --> 43:54.994
- [Kane chuckles]
- Lock it up.

43:54.995 --> 43:57.038
Eat your motherfucking ice cream...

43:57.039 --> 43:59.916
because we're about to deliver some
serious freedom through their skulls.

43:59.917 --> 44:01.718
[man on radio]
You have target confirmed.

44:01.877 --> 44:03.078
Go to fire.

44:03.711 --> 44:05.129
[indistinct]

44:05.130 --> 44:08.840
- Three, two, one. Kaboom.
- Oh, shit!

44:08.841 --> 44:10.217
[all exclaiming]

44:10.218 --> 44:11.302
Fuck, yeah, bro!

44:11.303 --> 44:14.096
Bomb! Have bomb! Bomb! Them!

44:14.097 --> 44:15.548
[Bennett] No, no! It's not him!

44:19.686 --> 44:21.687
- [man shouting in local language]
- [Page] Grenade!

44:21.688 --> 44:22.889
Bennett, kick it out!

44:26.443 --> 44:28.069
[Page] Fuck! Clear out!

44:28.070 --> 44:30.362
[panting]

44:30.363 --> 44:31.939
[dog farts and whimpers]

44:32.865 --> 44:33.991
[knock at door]

44:33.992 --> 44:35.818
Yeah, come in.

44:40.873 --> 44:43.834
I need to add my lawyer
to my visitation list.

44:43.835 --> 44:45.920
You having problems with your case?

44:45.921 --> 44:47.588
No.

44:47.589 --> 44:50.875
And please take my husband off my list.

44:51.843 --> 44:53.552
Why don't you have a seat, Red?

44:53.553 --> 44:56.722
I won't be staying, but thank you.

44:56.723 --> 44:59.342
Please... sit.

45:00.060 --> 45:02.103
[woman on PA]
The mail cart is going around.

45:02.104 --> 45:05.348
All letters are subject to inspection.

45:06.149 --> 45:07.816
You want to tell me
what's going on?

45:07.817 --> 45:09.526
I married a pillow.

45:09.527 --> 45:14.198
Soft, lumpy, and always
lying behind my back.

45:14.199 --> 45:17.951
Words like "always" are absolutes...

45:17.952 --> 45:23.032
and using them is a way to
reinforce what we wanna believe.

45:25.460 --> 45:27.787
When speaking emotionally...

45:28.838 --> 45:31.132
absolutes can be dangerous.

45:31.133 --> 45:33.300
Good advice. Thank you.

45:33.301 --> 45:37.004
Please add my lawyer
and remove my husband.

45:37.805 --> 45:41.767
You know, Red... marriage
is a two-way street.

45:41.768 --> 45:47.224
And you can't swim without getting wet.
See? I can say clichés, too. Ha!

45:49.651 --> 45:52.444
You owe it to your younger self to explore

45:52.445 --> 45:56.032
those things that made you wanna
marry this man in the first place.

45:56.033 --> 45:57.783
You may find that they're still there.

45:57.784 --> 46:02.996
I owe my younger self 23 years of
wild sex with multiple partners,

46:02.997 --> 46:05.166
but I'll settle for my name back.

46:05.167 --> 46:08.502
You made a lifelong commitment.

46:08.503 --> 46:10.003
That's sacred.

46:10.004 --> 46:13.924
You don't know my story, Healy, and
you don't know what he's done.

46:13.925 --> 46:15.008
_

46:15.009 --> 46:17.678
Hey! Language!

46:17.679 --> 46:18.887
I know what that word means,

46:18.888 --> 46:22.425
and it's not okay to refer to your
husband or any other man that way.

46:23.143 --> 46:27.979
You know, you huff in here...
like some put-upon martyr...

46:27.980 --> 46:32.443
like a smile would break your face,
trivializing a man's emotions.

46:32.444 --> 46:34.528
What is that? Some kind of a
Russian thing or something?

46:34.529 --> 46:38.650
- What the hell does that...
- Hey! Language! Again!

46:39.159 --> 46:42.904
That's the last time that I'm
gonna warn you, Mrs. Reznikov.

46:43.705 --> 46:45.747
You forget where you are...

46:45.748 --> 46:49.835
just like you forget that your
husband has a stake in this, too.

46:49.836 --> 46:51.462
Just because he made some mistakes

46:51.463 --> 46:54.215
doesn't mean that you can run off
and go sleep in your mother's room

46:54.216 --> 46:56.758
at the first sign of
white caps on the ocean.

46:56.759 --> 46:58.210
[inhales]

47:05.017 --> 47:06.511
[exhales]

47:31.586 --> 47:34.588
- You know, this is a bad fuckin' plan.
- It's a great fuckin' plan.

47:34.589 --> 47:36.298
Drugs in the tool belt,
tool belt to Luschek,

47:36.299 --> 47:38.550
Luschek to the streets, money.
Don't overthink it.

47:38.551 --> 47:40.927
You know, I missed the
part where you contribute.

47:40.928 --> 47:44.097
I am the fairy godmother
who watches over you

47:44.098 --> 47:46.892
to make sure that the plan doesn't
go up your cute little nose.

47:46.893 --> 47:50.437
Great. Finally I get a mother
who gives a shit about me

47:50.438 --> 47:53.899
and... it's bibbity-bobbity Big Boo.
[chuckles]

47:53.900 --> 47:55.101
[chuckles]

47:58.613 --> 48:00.572
- Uh, Boo?
- Huh?

48:00.573 --> 48:01.816
We've got a problem.

48:07.455 --> 48:09.122
Someone stole our candy.

48:09.123 --> 48:10.999
Oh!

48:11.000 --> 48:12.201
Fuck!

48:25.932 --> 48:29.301
All right, that's the last of the
E-Dorm mattresses, Mr. Caputo.

48:30.019 --> 48:32.313
No books. We're gonna
try to salvage those.

48:32.314 --> 48:33.640
Are you kidding me?

48:35.066 --> 48:37.351
- Doesn't matter.
- What's that?

48:40.071 --> 48:42.148
Doesn't matter.

48:47.245 --> 48:48.946
So, I'm confused.

49:01.676 --> 49:04.177
They're from that bush in
the yard by the greenhouse.

49:04.178 --> 49:05.262
They're not bean leaves,

49:05.263 --> 49:09.099
but they have, like, pods on
them, so I thought maybe they...

49:09.100 --> 49:10.517
Are you sleeping?

49:10.518 --> 49:11.928
[snoring]

49:32.790 --> 49:36.252
You know... you can't
actually feel the bites.

49:36.253 --> 49:41.332
Bedbug saliva contains a substance
that acts as a mild anesthetic.

49:42.342 --> 49:43.800
It's in your head.

49:43.801 --> 49:46.262
I should sleep without
a mattress more often.

49:46.263 --> 49:47.929
It's good for my back.

49:47.930 --> 49:51.683
If you feel like that's
the right thing to do...

49:51.684 --> 49:54.762
then you should absolutely do it.

49:57.774 --> 50:01.644
Still trying to preserve my kibun?

50:04.155 --> 50:07.274
I told Alex the truth
about something today...

50:07.784 --> 50:11.904
and she told me...
that I was a manipulative...

50:17.168 --> 50:19.662
She told me I was manipulative.

50:21.923 --> 50:23.958
I lie...

50:25.593 --> 50:27.419
I get in trouble.

50:28.471 --> 50:29.922
I truth...

50:31.683 --> 50:33.510
I get in trouble.

50:36.604 --> 50:38.229
I can't do anything right.

50:38.230 --> 50:41.608
What are you asking for? Advice?

50:41.609 --> 50:43.151
Here's some.

50:43.152 --> 50:45.479
Stop buying into your own horseshit.

50:47.615 --> 50:50.283
You tell me I'm scratching
is my imagination?

50:50.284 --> 50:53.454
Look around. The prison is crawling.

50:53.455 --> 50:56.498
You can tell everyone they
can't feel it all night long,

50:56.499 --> 50:59.501
but in the morning, we've
all been a bug buffet.

50:59.502 --> 51:02.546
Just... stop trying to
mold the real world

51:02.547 --> 51:06.167
into the one inside your
pointy blonde head.

51:12.724 --> 51:15.308
Maybe I am manipulative.

51:15.309 --> 51:18.846
From what I've seen...
to get what you want...

51:20.147 --> 51:22.649
while telling everyone
how clean you are...

51:22.650 --> 51:24.435
you play dirty.

51:25.152 --> 51:27.564
You just described my mother.

51:30.617 --> 51:33.535
She's a kibun ninja...

51:33.536 --> 51:37.205
or whatever the Korean
version of "ninja" is...

51:37.206 --> 51:39.583
and then the WASP version of that.

51:39.584 --> 51:41.918
Awaken your inner Russian.

51:41.919 --> 51:43.462
No more bullshit.

51:43.463 --> 51:46.006
Na zdorovie.

51:46.007 --> 51:49.085
The world is better in black and white...

51:49.886 --> 51:51.087
[grunts]

51:52.389 --> 51:53.840
and red.

51:56.768 --> 51:58.935
[Cesar] That's my favorite Daya story.

51:58.936 --> 52:00.020
What is it?

52:00.021 --> 52:03.023
What, you bang her and you don't
know her quinceañera story?

52:03.024 --> 52:06.067
She tells that story to everybody.

52:06.068 --> 52:10.406
Aleida got wasted and she tripped
and fell on the birthday cake

52:10.407 --> 52:12.533
and the candles lit her dress on fire...

52:12.534 --> 52:15.527
but you gotta hear
the way Daya tells it.

52:17.288 --> 52:20.700
I ain't gonna lie, man.
This shit... ain't easy.

52:22.293 --> 52:24.878
Yeah, I'm gonna have to
go it alone for a while.

52:24.879 --> 52:28.882
Nah, nah, nah. You get yourself
a little side of bacon...

52:28.883 --> 52:30.509
like Margarita.

52:30.510 --> 52:32.211
That's what women are made for.

52:32.762 --> 52:34.513
[baby whining]

52:34.514 --> 52:37.265
That used to be Daya's crib...

52:37.266 --> 52:40.185
and all the other little scrubs, too.

52:40.186 --> 52:43.313
It's nothing fancy, but, uh...

52:43.314 --> 52:45.315
it's got a lot of good luck.

52:45.316 --> 52:47.476
Buena suerte.

52:50.613 --> 52:53.699
I want you to have it, man.

52:53.700 --> 52:55.200
What about her?

52:55.201 --> 52:57.236
We'll get her something else.

52:58.538 --> 53:00.156
It's for Aleida's family.

53:00.957 --> 53:02.449
Salud!

53:08.047 --> 53:09.373
[sniffs]

53:10.424 --> 53:11.508
Margarita!

53:11.509 --> 53:13.343
[Margarita] Yeah?

53:13.344 --> 53:14.796
[Cesar speaking Spanish]

53:20.518 --> 53:23.220
[sighs] Six months old,
but she shits like a human.

53:26.273 --> 53:27.858
[Bell over PA] Good morning, ladies.

53:27.859 --> 53:30.861
Additional linen uniforms
are now available.

53:30.862 --> 53:36.192
If you are a small or an extra
small, first come, first serve.

54:07.899 --> 54:09.600
- You bitch!
- [gasps]

54:10.610 --> 54:12.235
Fuck you, Alex!

54:12.236 --> 54:13.687
Fuck you!

54:15.907 --> 54:17.483
[grunts]

54:24.165 --> 54:25.616
[grunts]

54:42.850 --> 54:44.468
[moaning]

55:08.417 --> 55:10.202
[moaning]

55:14.548 --> 55:16.625
[breathes deeply]

55:37.571 --> 55:38.898
[sighs]

55:50.498 --> 55:57.023
