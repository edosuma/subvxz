00:04.874 --> 00:06.223
Mr. InBetween.

All new,

00:12.969 --> 00:14.492
ANNOUNCER: FXX presents...

00:14.536 --> 00:17.104
It's Always Sunny
in Philadelphia.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.936
CHARLIE:
Uh, guys, I-I'd like
to raise a glass to Frank.

00:23.980 --> 00:26.765
Frank, another year has gone bysince you came into my life.

00:26.809 --> 00:29.203
I don't see any blue
on this menu.

00:29.246 --> 00:31.118
-Well, hang on. Don't interrupt.-Why do you want to eat blue?

00:31.161 --> 00:33.207
-The best foods are blue.
-MAC: Charlie,

00:33.250 --> 00:34.643
let's just order, shall we?

00:34.686 --> 00:36.210
Now, Dennis, what will I be
having this evening?

00:36.253 --> 00:38.299
-Oh, come on.
-Well, I don't want
to just order, okay?

00:38.342 --> 00:39.561
I'm trying to say some nice
words here, okay?

00:39.604 --> 00:41.519
-About what?
-About you, man.

00:41.563 --> 00:43.521
Oh, God. You people.

00:43.565 --> 00:45.219
Ugh, this guy again.

00:45.262 --> 00:47.177
Come on, man. What are you doinghere? This isn't Guigino's.

00:47.221 --> 00:48.309
Yeah, I thought you moved.

00:48.352 --> 00:51.355
I moved back. So...
Wait, you guys remember me?

00:51.399 --> 00:52.922
Uh, yeah, you're everywhere.

00:52.965 --> 00:54.358
Yeah. We can't get away
from you.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.143
You know what?
Doesn't matter.

00:56.186 --> 00:58.275
What's in them little bowls?
Blue, I hope.

00:58.319 --> 00:59.885
I... Bl...

00:59.929 --> 01:02.584
No, i-it's amuse-bouche
for the table.

01:02.627 --> 01:04.019
-What is it?
-We didn't order yet, pal.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.283
Again, Dennis, what am I having?

01:06.327 --> 01:08.981
-Stop asking me that.-I'm not paying for those, pal.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.244
They're compliments
from the chef.

01:10.287 --> 01:11.984
We don't want compliments,
we want food.

01:12.028 --> 01:14.465
If I wanted a compliment,I'd walk into a bar.

01:14.509 --> 01:15.771
-Oh, Dee. God.

01:15.814 --> 01:17.468
-Dee, shut up.
-MAC: Yeah, Dennis,
do you want me

01:17.512 --> 01:19.122
to throw my glass of water
in her face?

01:19.166 --> 01:20.471
Well, don't ask. Just do.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.256
Well, h-hang on a second, dude.You don't chew no good anymore.

01:22.299 --> 01:24.780
-You want me to chew that up
for you?
-I don't want that.

01:24.823 --> 01:26.173
Well, you haven't had your teethsharpened in a bit.

01:26.216 --> 01:28.349
-I better chew it.
-He gets his teeth sharpened?

01:28.392 --> 01:30.786
-Not as often as he should.
No. Uh...

01:32.657 --> 01:34.833
What's this?

01:34.877 --> 01:36.400
I think he's choking.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.837
-DEE: Oh, shit.
-Yeah, he can't get air.

01:39.882 --> 01:41.797
DEE:
Yeah.

01:52.286 --> 01:53.374
Hmm.

01:57.682 --> 02:01.077
Okay, folks, we have
a few specials tonight.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.079
Oh, my God!

02:40.334 --> 02:42.118
-FRANK: That's it! Yeah,
I'm absolutely having a fit!
-CHARLIE: All night long?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.337
-Look, I-I'm sorry, okay?-I'm having a fit. That's right.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.816
I don't know what happened.
I froze up, all right?

02:44.860 --> 02:46.253
-Oh, yeah. You froze up.
-May-Maybe I thought

02:46.296 --> 02:47.645
-that's how you wanted
to go out, Frank.
-Oh, yeah.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.212
That's how I wanted to go? Me?

02:49.256 --> 02:51.345
I don't know! I don't know
how you want to die.

02:51.388 --> 02:52.998
You only ever talkabout how you
don'twant to die,

02:53.042 --> 02:55.653
like in a hospital bed
or getting spit-roasted

02:55.697 --> 02:57.699
-by two Latin King gang membersin prison.
-Yeah.

02:57.742 --> 02:59.048
Okay, look, at least here,

02:59.091 --> 03:00.223
you're in a fancy restaurant,
right?

03:00.267 --> 03:02.312
-You're surrounded
by your friends.
-Oh, my friends.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.227
Who are watching me
choke to death

03:04.271 --> 03:06.621
-with pleasure in their eyes.
-Nobody had pleasure! Okay,

03:06.664 --> 03:08.231
-maybe I was a little mad
at you, all right?
-Yeah.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.363
Y-You didn't let me finish
my speech.

03:09.406 --> 03:10.842
You kept interrupting me
about anything that's blue

03:10.886 --> 03:12.453
-on the menu, right?
-Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.281
You didn't let me chew your foodfor you. You know, you...

03:14.324 --> 03:15.499
Oh, well, you're not gonna
be able to do that, either.

03:15.543 --> 03:16.892
No more chewing my food.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.154
You mash it too thin.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.938
-You take all the flavor
out of it.

03:19.982 --> 03:22.289
-You get all the nutrients.
I get all the mush.
-You...

03:22.332 --> 03:24.247
-Do you think I want
to chew your food?
-Yeah, you...

03:24.291 --> 03:26.423
Well, you don't have to do thatanymore, because I'm going.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.164
-Where are you gonna go?
-I'm going

03:28.208 --> 03:30.819
-to the one person
who actually cares about me.
-All right.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.690
Good.
You know what, fine, go.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.039
Get out of here.
I don't care.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.303
I'll go back to being me.
You know, young and cool

03:36.346 --> 03:38.870
before I started chewingthe food of some crazy old man.

03:38.914 --> 03:41.612
You know,
I used to do cool shit, Frank!

03:41.656 --> 03:43.832
I used to be cool!

03:43.875 --> 03:45.877
I'm cool.

03:50.882 --> 03:54.712
That was an interesting evening.

03:54.756 --> 03:57.324
Yeah. Yeah, it was.
Frank was pissed.

03:57.367 --> 03:58.629
I would've stepped in,

03:58.673 --> 04:00.370
but, of course,
I was taking my cues from you.

04:01.458 --> 04:02.981
Why?

04:03.025 --> 04:05.419
Well, you didn't tell me whetherI should save him or not.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.203
But why?
I mean, wh...

04:07.247 --> 04:09.336
why do I still have
to tell you what to do?

04:09.379 --> 04:11.773
Why do I still have
to order your dinners for you?

04:11.816 --> 04:13.514
And why is it up to me to decide

04:13.557 --> 04:16.168
whether or not you're going
to save a man's life?

04:16.212 --> 04:17.300
You know what the problem is?

04:17.344 --> 04:20.476
I can't depend on you.
I can't depend on anyone.

04:20.521 --> 04:22.871
You know, I mean, if that
had been me choking tonight...

04:22.914 --> 04:24.568
-no one would've saved me.
-No.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.788
I-I would've saved you, Dennis.I would have saved you.

04:26.831 --> 04:27.876
-If you told me to.

04:27.919 --> 04:30.574
Oh, Jesus Christ--
if I told you to?

04:30.618 --> 04:31.749
Oh!

04:31.793 --> 04:34.665
♪ Pizza man, pizza man♪

04:34.709 --> 04:37.102
♪ I got pizza here,
who wants pizza man?♪

04:37.146 --> 04:39.366
What are you doing here, man?
It's, like, after midnight.

04:39.409 --> 04:41.368
Uh, after midnight?What are you, like, in your 40s?

04:41.411 --> 04:42.804
-Yeah. As are you.
-Yeah.

04:42.847 --> 04:45.676
-Have a slice.
Let's get into it, boys.
-No! No.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.462
Dennis cannot eat cheese,
because cheese is poison.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.551
-No dairy for this guy.
-That's actually correct.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.596
Oh. It's all good, though.
I actually ate all the cheese

04:52.640 --> 04:54.381
on the walk over, so...
no cheese!

04:54.424 --> 04:55.817
Oh! That solves it.
Dennis will have

04:55.860 --> 04:57.688
-the crust and the sauce, then.-No, Mac.

04:57.732 --> 04:59.603
Not gonna have the crust.
Are you insane?

04:59.647 --> 05:01.475
I mean, you know, carbs aside,
it's absolutely teeming

05:01.518 --> 05:02.563
with gluten.

05:02.606 --> 05:03.694
I knew that.
I just... I forgot.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.348
-You didn't know that.
-I did.

05:05.392 --> 05:06.480
Don't worry about that, though.It's all good.

05:06.523 --> 05:07.611
I ate the crust, too.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.700
Oh, so you came over
with a box of tomato sauce?

05:09.744 --> 05:10.832
Oh, great.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.355
-Dennis will have the sauce.
-Sugar.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.574
-Sugar.
-Uh, no.

05:13.617 --> 05:15.271
Actually,
I slurped that up, too,

05:15.315 --> 05:17.621
because that was just kind of
looking good, so I figured...

05:17.665 --> 05:18.579
So you ate them all separately--all the elements--

05:18.622 --> 05:20.537
and then came over
with an empty pizza box?

05:20.581 --> 05:22.496
-This is a nice gesture,
you know.
-It's not.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.411
-It's the suggestion of food.
-Guys. Guys, guys, guys, guys.

05:24.454 --> 05:26.848
-Oh, my God.
You are not going to believe

05:26.891 --> 05:29.067
-what just happened to me. Okay.-Christ. She's here now.

05:29.111 --> 05:30.634
-So, I'm wandering around,
right, for hours.
-Yeah.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.375
I-I'm just thinking
about what happened tonight

05:32.419 --> 05:33.724
and-- with Frank, you know--

05:33.768 --> 05:35.552
and-and I'm not proud of it,
but I, uh...

05:35.596 --> 05:37.815
Something weird kind of happenedto me with that whole thing,

05:37.859 --> 05:39.774
'cause I...
I got a pretty good rush

05:39.817 --> 05:41.732
from a man almost dying
right in front of me.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.647
I-I liked it, and-and,

05:43.691 --> 05:45.301
you know,
I'm thinking about it so much

05:45.345 --> 05:46.433
that I sort of space out.

05:46.476 --> 05:47.521
Long story short,

05:47.564 --> 05:49.610
I wind up in the middle
of the street, okay?

05:49.653 --> 05:52.308
And an Uber
just goes flying by me

05:52.352 --> 05:54.441
at, like-like, 50.
Almost hit me!

05:54.484 --> 05:55.746
You're so good at
telling stories. So concise.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.444
I wish it did hit you.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.576
You guys,
the rush I got from that...

05:59.620 --> 06:01.535
-You would not believe it.
-DENNIS: Okay, I-I...

06:01.578 --> 06:02.579
I don't believe it.
I don't care about it.

06:02.623 --> 06:04.451
-I don't care. I don't care.
-It blew my mind.

06:04.494 --> 06:05.756
-Why'd you come over?-No, wait, I-I can't stand this.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.845
I-I can't do this. I mean,it's in the middle of the night.

06:07.889 --> 06:10.195
-Yeah, that's right.
-Okay? And I'm surrounded
by lunatics here.

06:10.239 --> 06:11.545
We are surrounded by lunatics.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.547
-You're one of the lunatics!
-What?

06:13.590 --> 06:14.896
Okay, you know what? This is theone thing I've learned tonight.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.898
-I can't depend on anyone
but myself, okay?
-What? What?

06:16.941 --> 06:19.117
So I got to take care of myself.I got to stay healthy.

06:19.161 --> 06:20.684
You know what?
I'm gonna go to bed.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.294
That's what I should...
I'm gonna go to bed.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.514
Go to bed? What are you, 40?

06:24.558 --> 06:26.473
We're the same age!

06:26.516 --> 06:29.345
-Uh, Dennis,
should I go to bed, too?

06:29.389 --> 06:30.825
DENNIS:
I don't care!

06:30.868 --> 06:32.609
-He said yes, I think?
-Oh, I don't think
he gives a shit

06:32.653 --> 06:34.002
-what you do.
-I don't think he cares.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.656
He cares because
we depend on each other,

06:35.699 --> 06:37.571
so I should probably go to sleepbecause we depend on each other.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.224
Tomorrow, I got to wake up
and depend on him.

06:39.268 --> 06:41.618
He's gonna depend on me,
so good night, guys.

06:44.882 --> 06:47.581
Okay, so, what do you
want to get into?

06:47.624 --> 06:49.670
Oh, I kind of wanted to hang outwith the guys, so...

06:49.713 --> 06:51.672
I know. I know. Me, too.

06:51.715 --> 06:54.588
-But they went to bed,
so just you and me.
-Mm.

06:54.631 --> 06:57.417
Yeah, but I-I don't
want it to be.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.597
-You know?
-Oh.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.642
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.648
Okay.

07:20.004 --> 07:22.616
Hey-o! Look who's up.
Sleepyhead.

07:22.659 --> 07:25.749
Here you go. You know
you grind your teeth at night?

07:25.793 --> 07:27.316
What is this?

07:27.359 --> 07:29.144
What the hell are you doing
in my home?

07:29.187 --> 07:30.580
I'm moving in.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.756
Hey, you had my back.
Now I'm gonna have yours.

07:32.800 --> 07:33.975
Uh, first thing we got to do

07:34.018 --> 07:35.542
is beef up the security
around here.

07:35.585 --> 07:38.370
You know how easy it was
for me to get in that window?

07:39.720 --> 07:41.678
Took me all of 30 seconds
with this hammer.

07:41.722 --> 07:44.159
I could have been
bashing your face in

07:44.202 --> 07:46.161
before you knew what hit you,

07:46.204 --> 07:49.207
which would've been this hammer,which I already had in my hand,

07:49.251 --> 07:50.687
in case you weren't listening.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.297
Wh-What's going on?

07:52.341 --> 07:54.299
It's you and me
against the world, kid.

07:54.343 --> 07:55.692
You got a nice place here.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.520
Wouldn't be bad
to have a roommate.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.391
Okay, look, I only saved you

07:59.435 --> 08:01.611
because it's what
any decent person would do,

08:01.655 --> 08:02.873
but I don't need a roommate.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.745
I already live here
with my mother.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.921
Oh. That old vegetable lady
is your mom?

08:06.964 --> 08:08.966
Nah, you don't have to worry
about her.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.446
I took care of her.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.882
Took care of her?
What do you mean?

08:11.926 --> 08:14.537
I threw a sheet over her head.
She was freaking me out.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.757
Mom! Oh, my God!

08:16.800 --> 08:18.541
Are you all right?

08:18.585 --> 08:21.805
I don't think she can
hear you, pal. She's gonzo.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.198
Why would you want
to live with that

08:23.241 --> 08:25.635
when you can live with me
and get a lot of good action?

08:25.679 --> 08:28.682
Please leave
before I call the police.

08:28.725 --> 08:29.683
Suit yourself.

08:29.726 --> 08:32.816
-Door or window?
-The door is fine.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.991
It's gonna take me a long time
to bash through that door.

08:42.870 --> 08:45.699
Guys, how long
is this gonna take?

08:45.742 --> 08:47.788
Dennis needs to finishhis pre-workout shake, Charlie.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.441
And I rubbed down his calves,

08:49.485 --> 08:51.226
and now I have to tape
his ankles.

08:51.269 --> 08:53.228
Yeah, but can we just, like,
play already?

08:53.271 --> 08:54.838
No, we can't just play, Charlie.We can't just play.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.710
Are you insane?!
We can't just play!

08:56.753 --> 08:58.799
-Uh, what's he...? What?

08:58.842 --> 09:00.627
Look, honestly, Dennis shouldn'teven be playing basketball

09:00.670 --> 09:02.454
-in the first place...
-Wrong, Mac.

09:02.498 --> 09:05.414
Basketball is exactly
what I should be doing.

09:05.457 --> 09:06.981
It's what men like Frank
never did,

09:07.024 --> 09:09.592
and their bodies became soft
and feeble and-and round

09:09.636 --> 09:12.682
and at high risk for injury anddisease and choking on things.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.205
-Well, can we do something?
-Yes.

09:14.249 --> 09:16.599
Let's just... let's begin
with a light warm-up of, uh...

09:16.643 --> 09:18.035
passing,

09:18.079 --> 09:20.298
and then after 15 minutes
or so of that,

09:20.342 --> 09:22.736
we'll work our way
into a light jog,

09:22.779 --> 09:23.606
and then we'll do some layups.

09:23.650 --> 09:26.696
-Passing. All right.
-Too hard. Too fast.

09:29.046 --> 09:30.613
Still a little bit too hard.

09:30.657 --> 09:31.701
Simple.

09:37.489 --> 09:38.665
-Oh.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.144
Ah, damn it.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.016
Jesus, man. What-what the hell
was that? Are you okay?

09:42.059 --> 09:44.671
Ow. I don't know.My... timing's a little bit off.

09:44.714 --> 09:47.848
I... might not be feeling
too well all of a sudden.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.197
Wait a second.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.765
Dennis, I-I feel like there's alittle bit of pollen in the air.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.767
Pollen?!

09:53.810 --> 09:55.769
You didn't tell me
there was to be pollen today.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.335
I-I can't do pollen.
I don't do pollen.

09:57.379 --> 09:58.859
I know. I didn't know.
I mean, maybe,

09:58.902 --> 10:00.295
on account of the season,
I thought maybe...

10:00.338 --> 10:01.905
-Oh. Oh!
-: I'm sorry.

10:01.949 --> 10:05.300
-Come on, Dee. Why are you here?-Hear me out, you guys.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.476
This whole thing with Frank
and the Uber stuff--

10:07.519 --> 10:08.782
it's got me thinking, you know.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.653
I feel like the only way
to truly live life

10:10.697 --> 10:13.264
to its fullest is to live it
on the edge.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.136
-On the edge of what?
-On the edge of life or death.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.790
So, I went into
the Puerto Rican part of town,

10:16.833 --> 10:18.269
started making fun
of their big fat asses

10:18.313 --> 10:19.706
and asked them
if they were Dominican.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.751
-What?!
-Yeah.
-Why-why would you do that?

10:21.795 --> 10:23.492
Well, to be fair,
I did start with some stuff

10:23.535 --> 10:24.711
that was slightly
less offensive, but turns out,

10:24.754 --> 10:26.756
they're a very lovely community,so I really had to...

10:26.800 --> 10:27.714
I had to dig deeper.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.541
Really, really hit 'em
where it hurt.

10:29.585 --> 10:30.673
Anyway, they're on their way.

10:30.717 --> 10:31.935
They're on their way?!

10:31.979 --> 10:33.763
Yeah, after what I said,
sure, yeah.

10:33.807 --> 10:36.113
I was like, "Um, you guys,
why don't you take a break

10:36.157 --> 10:38.768
"from your cockfighting and,uh, you know, hop in your rafts

10:38.812 --> 10:40.814
and come bring it
to a real American?"

10:40.857 --> 10:42.467
And then I was like,
"Follow me."

10:43.904 --> 10:45.296
-CHARLIE: That's Mexican!
-DENNIS: That's Mexican.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.558
-What are you doing?
-Oh! That did it.

10:46.602 --> 10:47.690
-Why are you doing this?
-It pissed 'em off.

10:47.734 --> 10:48.822
Because it-it gave me a r...

10:48.865 --> 10:50.171
a-a thrill
like you wouldn't believe.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.173
Anyway, you guys want in
on this with me?

10:52.216 --> 10:53.740
-No!
-No!
-What?!

10:53.783 --> 10:54.697
-You-you would put us
all at risk

10:54.741 --> 10:58.396
with your suicidal race-baiting.I... I-I...

10:58.440 --> 11:00.268
Eh, something's off.
I-I got to go home.

11:00.311 --> 11:01.617
-What?
-Oh, Dennis. Dennis, yes.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.705
-I got to go home.
-You're leaving?

11:02.749 --> 11:04.533
You know what? He-he needs
his post-workout shake.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.535
-You haven't worked out yet.-That's what it is. I need a...

11:06.578 --> 11:07.797
Yes, we were playing basketball,

11:07.841 --> 11:08.755
and I've depleted
my electrolytes,

11:08.798 --> 11:09.712
and now I'm Dee-shaming,

11:09.756 --> 11:11.061
and that's depleted me
even more,

11:11.105 --> 11:12.846
-so, yes.
-Oh, come on.
-You know what?

11:12.889 --> 11:13.977
-Uh, let me...
let me get you home, Dennis.
-I'm wobbly.

11:14.021 --> 11:15.326
Here. You can
count on me, buddy.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.588
-All right, get me...
-You can count on me.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.808
-Get me home.
-He can count on me, guys.

11:18.852 --> 11:20.767
The hell's wrong with him?

11:20.810 --> 11:22.769
Uh, pollen, I guess.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.727
Huh.

11:24.771 --> 11:28.339
So, uh, you want
to take this beating with me?

11:28.383 --> 11:29.863
No.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.739
-WAITER: Hey, Mom.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.175
Sorry I'm late.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.656
Had to work a double shift.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.963
Hey-o! All good.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.616
Made her dinner already.
She's eating blue.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.967
-What is this?
-Well, I figure,

11:47.010 --> 11:49.752
you were at work, and your mom
was stuck home alone,

11:49.796 --> 11:51.798
so I broke in again.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.539
What did you do to her?

11:54.583 --> 11:56.890
What? Well, I just
spruced her up a little bit.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.805
-What do you think?
-I think she look nuts!

11:58.848 --> 12:01.851
Okay, you know what?
Stop coming here.

12:01.895 --> 12:04.375
I don't want you here. Stop
breaking into my home, okay?

12:04.419 --> 12:07.988
Whoa. Why are you being
such a hard-on about this?

12:08.031 --> 12:09.772
I'm just trying
to help a little bit.

12:09.816 --> 12:12.253
You know, I did a little
homework while you were away.

12:12.296 --> 12:16.257
You graduated at the top
of your class with honors,

12:16.300 --> 12:18.912
and were enrolled
in pilot school.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.348
But then, your mommy got sick,

12:20.391 --> 12:23.351
and you had to take other jobs
and make ends meet.

12:23.394 --> 12:25.701
I mean, it must've been
really hard being up there,

12:25.745 --> 12:27.224
slinging V8 Juice

12:27.268 --> 12:29.966
when you should've been captainof the ship.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.882
What is this?

12:32.926 --> 12:36.059
Somebody enrolled somebody
back into pilot school.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.845
So, what do you say we quit
that dead-end job you're in

12:38.888 --> 12:41.282
and put your mommy
in a real nice home?

12:41.325 --> 12:44.067
Something with
24-hour care, on me.

12:44.111 --> 12:46.722
And not one of them
bang 'em and bin 'em joints.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.202
Something really nice.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.073
Would be nice to go back
to pilot school.

12:50.117 --> 12:51.858
Yeah. Yeah.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.294
Oh, let me give you some more.

12:53.337 --> 12:55.165
Yeah. Here you go. Here you go.

12:55.209 --> 12:58.734
Yeah. Blue has
the most antioxygens.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.216
Ugh.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.870
Christ. I feel like I'm dying.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.872
Just let me help you, Dennis.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.874
-Here, have another
health shake.

13:07.917 --> 13:10.050
No. I don't want another one
of your stupid shakes, Mac.

13:10.093 --> 13:11.399
All right?
And for the last time,

13:11.442 --> 13:12.704
please just leave me alone.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.968
Just...

13:15.011 --> 13:17.274
-What are you doing?

13:17.318 --> 13:18.841
I want to throw this shake

13:18.885 --> 13:20.495
in your stupid face,
but I'm struggling.

13:20.538 --> 13:22.889
Charlie, will you please throwthis shake in Mac's face for me?

13:22.932 --> 13:24.412
-Me?
-Yes.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.762
-Oh.
-Dennis, do you want me
to throw it into my own face?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.851
That would ruin the effect.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.766
-Right. Charlie,
throw this in my face.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.942
Well, don't tell him
to throw it in your face,

13:32.986 --> 13:34.291
because now I feel like
you want it.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.858
Uh, what if I throw it
in my face?

13:35.902 --> 13:37.860
-I don't want it.-MAC: No, you're not following.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.557
He wants you to throw that
in my face,

13:39.601 --> 13:40.863
and he wants me to not want it.

13:40.907 --> 13:43.431
-I don't want it, right, Dennis?-You've both ruined the moment.

13:43.474 --> 13:44.911
You've misunderstood
what I'm going for,

13:44.954 --> 13:47.217
and I'm just gonna go lie down
on my bed. I feel so awful.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.263
-Yeah. I'll carry you,
because I...-No, no, no. You're not gonna...

13:49.306 --> 13:50.960
No. You dropped me twice
last time.

13:51.004 --> 13:51.874
You bumbling idiot.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.441
You're probably also
covered in pollen,

13:53.484 --> 13:55.095
which is making me
feel horrible.

13:55.138 --> 13:58.054
A pollen-covered man offeringto carry a-a perfectly well man.

13:58.098 --> 13:59.882
It's insane.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.144
-Hey, uh, can I have your...?
-I'm sorry.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.972
-You mind if I have
his shake, then,

14:03.016 --> 14:04.104
-if he's not gonna have it?
-Huh?

14:04.147 --> 14:05.540
-Can I have this?
-No, that's, uh...

14:05.583 --> 14:08.108
That's his shake, so...
you can't have it. Just...

14:08.151 --> 14:11.328
Yeah, but... I-I want it,
and he said he didn't want it.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.287
Yeah, yeah, but he might
want it later, so...

14:13.330 --> 14:14.810
Yeah, yeah,
but I kind of want it now,

14:14.854 --> 14:16.159
so I'd like to have
the shake, then.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.552
Yeah, but it's not really
for you.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.075
Yeah, but I want it,
and he's not having it,

14:19.119 --> 14:20.598
so I don't really see
any reason why...

14:20.642 --> 14:22.992
-You can't have it, Charlie!
-Yeah! I will drink it!

14:24.037 --> 14:26.039
What is this?

14:27.388 --> 14:28.998
It's a... protein shake.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.782
It's just a health shake
for Dennis.

14:30.826 --> 14:32.306
Yeah, but it tastes like pizza.

14:32.349 --> 14:33.916
Oh, really?
Nah, it's...

14:33.960 --> 14:35.744
You know what? There's a lot
of different flavors.

14:35.787 --> 14:38.181
That's probably, like,
the pizza-flavored one.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.009
And soda.

14:40.053 --> 14:43.056
Wha-- Are you feeding Dennis

14:43.099 --> 14:45.145
blended-up pizza
and soda shakes?

14:45.188 --> 14:47.538
Shh. Yes. Uh, I...

14:47.582 --> 14:50.802
-Why? Why are you doing that?
-Because I'm...

14:50.846 --> 14:52.630
I'm poisoning him, all right?
Just...

14:52.674 --> 14:54.067
-What?!
-A little bit.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.983
Look, uh, all the gluten
and the sugar and the dairy,

14:57.026 --> 14:59.507
uh, just wreaks havoc
on his system, you know?

14:59.550 --> 15:00.812
-Oh.
-And it makes him so weak.

15:00.856 --> 15:04.033
And then he's gonna depend on meto take care of him,

15:04.077 --> 15:05.774
to bring him back
from the brink of death.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.297
-Why are you doing that?
-You know what I'm saying?

15:07.341 --> 15:09.386
-Well, because I want him
to depend on me, Charlie.
-Oh.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.432
-DEE: Nah! That's gonna take

15:11.475 --> 15:12.999
-way too long.
-CHARLIE: Whoa.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.870
Dee, did you just
scale up the side

15:14.914 --> 15:16.089
-of the building?
-: Yeah.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.873
Free soloed it.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.440
Sucked though.
Didn't feel a thing.

15:19.483 --> 15:22.008
Look, Mac, Munchausen by proxy,that's cute and everything.

15:22.051 --> 15:25.228
But if you want Dennis
to really depend on you,

15:25.272 --> 15:28.928
you're gonna have to
save his life... for real.

15:30.277 --> 15:31.669
Oh.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.976
And I'm gonna help you.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.847
Aw...

15:35.891 --> 15:38.241
Don't. Just don't.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.642
-Hey! You're just in time
for a blue feast.
-Hey.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.818
-Mm.
-Did you have a good sleep?

15:49.861 --> 15:51.037
Yeah. To be honest,

15:51.080 --> 15:52.864
I had the best night's sleep
of my life.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.127
-Oh.
-Yeah.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.824
I feel kind of guilty
saying this, but, uh,

15:55.867 --> 15:57.434
since you found a home
for my mom,

15:57.478 --> 15:58.870
I feel like
this-this huge weight

15:58.914 --> 16:00.220
-has been lifted off of me.
-Ah.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.917
-Great! Let's eat.
-Yeah.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.832
-Come on. Okay. All right.
-Okay. Great.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.268
-See what we got here.
-Mm-hmm.

16:05.312 --> 16:06.835
Uh...

16:06.878 --> 16:09.229
Yeah, I don't know
if I want to eat that.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.013
Oh. Oh, okay.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.494
Well, I just worked on it
a long time.

16:13.537 --> 16:17.150
Well, three of the thingsare still in plastic packaging.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.151
All right.

16:18.194 --> 16:20.414
Well, how 'bout
if you just make a speech?

16:20.457 --> 16:22.024
-A what?
-A speech. You know,

16:22.068 --> 16:24.896
something to honor
our new relationship.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.594
Uh, do I have to?

16:26.637 --> 16:28.248
Yes.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.901
Oh.

16:29.945 --> 16:32.165
Okay. Well, uh...

16:32.208 --> 16:33.470
this is exciting.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.385
Good start.

16:35.429 --> 16:39.041
Uh, I'm excited to get back
in the simulator,

16:39.085 --> 16:40.912
log some more hours.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.044
Oh, good, good.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.133
Well, but don't just make
the speech about you.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.701
-Oh.
-Put me in there
a little bit, too.

16:46.744 --> 16:48.311
Oh.

16:48.355 --> 16:50.400
Okay. Uh...

16:50.444 --> 16:53.838
Uh, thanks for sticking my mom
in that home.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.232
-Never could've done it myself.-Yeah. Mm, mm.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.539
She always said it's the last
thing she ever wanted, so...

16:58.582 --> 17:00.671
-So, thank you.
-What?

17:00.715 --> 17:01.759
-Thank you.
-Wait, your mom said

17:01.803 --> 17:02.847
that's the last thing
she wanted,

17:02.891 --> 17:04.501
-was to be in a home?
-Yeah, yeah.

17:04.545 --> 17:06.286
She said it all the time.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.766
So, when you saw her in there,
why'd you let her stay?

17:08.810 --> 17:10.420
Well, I didn't see her.
You took her.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.335
You mean you didn't have
the decency to go?

17:12.378 --> 17:15.208
You told me not to,to avoid the emotion of it all.

17:15.251 --> 17:17.471
Well, I told you not to
because I wassticking her

17:17.513 --> 17:19.299
in a bang 'em and bin 'em joint.

17:19.342 --> 17:20.996
-What?
-They're much cheaper!

17:21.040 --> 17:23.520
I'm starting to think
I had you pegged all wrong.

17:23.564 --> 17:26.088
I'm sorry, can we go back to the"bang 'em and bin 'em" thing?

17:26.132 --> 17:28.873
To think I trusted my life
with you, when you would treat

17:28.917 --> 17:30.136
your mother like that.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.573
I bet you'd let meget spit-roasted by Latin Kings

17:32.616 --> 17:34.314
just like that, wouldn't you?

17:34.357 --> 17:35.706
I'm sorry, I can't follow
this conversation.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.317
-Where is my mother?
-And if you think

17:37.360 --> 17:40.320
I'm paying the 40 grand
you owe that flight school,

17:40.363 --> 17:42.365
you got another thing coming!

17:42.409 --> 17:44.237
-Iowe them?
I can't afford that.
-Yes!

17:44.280 --> 17:46.326
Well, then you probablycan't afford the bin 'em joint,

17:46.369 --> 17:48.589
'cause that shit
ain't free, bozo!

17:48.632 --> 17:49.807
Where are you going?

17:49.851 --> 17:52.288
I'm out of here!
Have a nice life!

17:52.332 --> 17:55.117
And... kiss my ass, dirtbag.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.076
I can't afford any of this!

18:02.820 --> 18:04.561
Okay.

18:04.605 --> 18:06.737
This powder is
a major histamine toxin.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.174
The second Dennis drinks it,

18:08.217 --> 18:10.219
his throat's just gonna start
to seize right up.

18:10.263 --> 18:11.699
After a few minutes, Mac,
you jab him

18:11.742 --> 18:13.918
with that EpiPen--
you save his life.

18:13.962 --> 18:15.311
-After a few minutes?
-Yeah.

18:15.355 --> 18:16.530
15, 20 tops.
Just until he flatlines.

18:16.573 --> 18:17.922
Then you bring him back.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.837
-Uh, no, Dee,
we're not gonna do that.
-Wait, what?

18:19.881 --> 18:21.317
You're not gonna poison him?

18:21.361 --> 18:22.753
You don't think
Dennis is gonna see

18:22.797 --> 18:24.407
right through this silly ruse?

18:24.451 --> 18:25.843
-All right.
-CHARLIE: Yeah. Now, Frank,
on the other hand...

18:25.887 --> 18:28.150
-Yeah. Now, Frank's
not gonna see through it.
-No.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.717
So-so that's why
we invited Frank.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.633
Because Charlie and I can jumpto action and save Frank's life.

18:32.676 --> 18:33.851
-Together.
-Now-- Yeah. Now, of course,

18:33.895 --> 18:35.375
Dennis will see
through that ruse as well,

18:35.418 --> 18:36.811
but he'll be very impressed

18:36.854 --> 18:39.335
with how far I'm willing to go
to prove my worth to him.

18:39.379 --> 18:40.597
-Then Dennis will love me.
-Frank's not gonna

18:40.641 --> 18:41.772
read into any of this.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.209
He's just gonna be happy
that I saved him.

18:43.252 --> 18:44.645
Listen, consider the flatline
though, okay?

18:44.688 --> 18:47.735
'Cause I really got to know whatpeople see on the other side.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.302
-Yeah. They're coming.
Shut up. Shut up.
-Shut up, Dee. Dee.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.217
-Shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up, shut up.
-Frank! Dennis!

18:51.260 --> 18:53.175
Here, uh, come-come on.
Have a seat.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.829
Thanks for joining us, guys.

18:54.872 --> 18:58.180
Uh, Frank, I, uh... I picked upyour hair for you, so...

19:00.139 --> 19:01.618
Dennis, you're looking better.

19:01.662 --> 19:04.447
I'm feeling better, Mac,
no thanks to you.

19:04.491 --> 19:06.275
Okay, guys, I'd-I'd like
to make a quick toast,

19:06.319 --> 19:07.885
if I could, before we begin.

19:07.929 --> 19:10.018
Oh, my God! Why?

19:10.061 --> 19:11.846
Why are you people all here?

19:11.889 --> 19:12.803
Hey, man,
don't interrupt, okay?

19:12.847 --> 19:14.675
We're not ready to order. Go.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.329
Well, I couldn't take your orderif I wanted to,

19:16.372 --> 19:18.418
because I'm just here
to beg for my job back,

19:18.461 --> 19:19.810
thanks to this guy.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.682
Do I know you?

19:21.725 --> 19:23.074
-Unbelievable.
-I don't know
what's going on here.

19:23.118 --> 19:24.902
-Can I get a whiskey, pal?
-Can I have one as well?

19:24.946 --> 19:26.687
Okay, guys, uh, before we begin,

19:26.730 --> 19:28.863
I-I'd like to make
a-a quick speech.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.038
Frank...  look,

19:30.081 --> 19:31.605
we all understand
why you were mad at us.

19:31.648 --> 19:32.910
You have every right to be.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.695
But I'd like to make
a peace offering.

19:34.738 --> 19:37.654
-I sharpened my teeth, FYI.

19:37.698 --> 19:39.439
That's good.
Wish you'd let me do it, but--

19:39.482 --> 19:41.441
-Please don't interrupt. I...
-Charlie, would--

19:41.484 --> 19:42.616
-could you get to the...
-Yeah, okay. Uh...

19:42.659 --> 19:44.270
Over here is the peace offering.

19:44.313 --> 19:47.273
Oh. Whoa.
Is that a... is that a shake?

19:47.316 --> 19:49.057
Yeah. Can you guys
just not interrupt me though?

19:49.100 --> 19:50.450
-Can I have that, please?
-Uh...
-CHARLIE: No.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.452
-It's not for you.
-DENNIS: Uh...
-No. Yeah, no, no.

19:52.495 --> 19:54.584
Because th-that's blue,and you don't like blue, Dennis.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.456
Uh, well, I would
very much like to have it,

19:56.499 --> 19:58.022
because I do feel like the
shakes are finally kicking in

19:58.066 --> 19:59.633
and that's why I'm feeling
a little bit better, so...

19:59.676 --> 20:00.634
-Oh.
-CHARLIE: Yeah.

20:00.677 --> 20:01.635
Well, no,
it's not for him, okay?

20:01.678 --> 20:03.724
-It's for Frank.
-I'm not interested.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.160
He doesn't want it, soI would like to have it, please.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.596
Absolutely not. I forbid it.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.642
Stop trying to prove yourself tome in all the wrong ways, Mac.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.034
Yeah, look, Frank,
just drink the shake, okay?

20:10.078 --> 20:11.253
You have to have it.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.907
-He doesn't want it!
-Somebody drink it!

20:12.950 --> 20:14.604
Give it to Dennis,
for crying out loud.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.389
-Give it to me!
-No! Absolutely not!

20:16.432 --> 20:17.651
Why not, goddamn it?

20:17.694 --> 20:18.913
-Because it's poisoned!
-Oh!

20:18.956 --> 20:19.957
-Uh, what?
-MAC: I had to tell him!

20:20.001 --> 20:21.698
-He was gonna...
-Oh, come on!

20:21.742 --> 20:23.657
-It was gonna be
his blood and...
-There's poison in it.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.485
-We poisoned it.
-Excuse me?

20:25.528 --> 20:27.835
-It has a little bit
of poison in it.
-It has poison in it.

20:27.878 --> 20:29.967
-Poison in it.
-It's got-- It's poisoned.

20:33.536 --> 20:34.668
You were gonna poison me,
Charlie?

20:34.711 --> 20:36.539
-Yeah.
-Yeah. And I was as well.

20:36.583 --> 20:39.063
It's just...But I was gonna save you, dude.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.413
Me, too.

20:40.456 --> 20:42.545
-Like, right afterward.
-Immediately.

20:42.589 --> 20:45.331
I should've done that
in the first place, man.

20:45.374 --> 20:46.767
-Me, too.
-Shut up, Mac!

20:46.810 --> 20:48.159
You're stepping on my...

20:48.203 --> 20:51.467
Look, Frank, I'm sorry, dude.

20:51.511 --> 20:52.947
I screwed up, man.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.557
I should've saved you,

20:54.601 --> 20:57.256
and I'll always save you
from now on, I promise.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.129
Thanks, Charlie.

21:01.172 --> 21:03.436
I knew you had my back.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.916
And I had your back, too,
with the plan.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.657
I was gonna...

21:07.701 --> 21:08.963
-do the plan...
-Yeah, Mac glommed on

21:09.006 --> 21:10.443
-to my thing and...
-Yeah, and save Frank.

21:10.486 --> 21:12.488
-Yeah.
-And then you were gonna be
impressed by that

21:12.532 --> 21:14.534
and see that you need me
as well.

21:14.577 --> 21:15.535
DENNIS:
Oh.

21:15.578 --> 21:16.666
Okay. I think I understand.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.886
So you were still gonna
rely on a decision

21:18.929 --> 21:20.366
that somebody else made,
only, this time,

21:20.409 --> 21:21.976
you were potentially
gonna kill a man?

21:24.021 --> 21:26.328
Are you not pleased?

21:26.372 --> 21:27.329
No.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.809
Holy shit.
I think Dee drank the shake.

21:29.853 --> 21:31.812
Dee, did you-- Dee?

21:31.855 --> 21:33.683
-MAC and CHARLIE: Oh!
-Holy shit.
-Oh, Dee!

21:35.076 --> 21:36.599
-That's okay. I have this.
-Uh, okay.

21:36.643 --> 21:37.992
-Hit her with it, man.
-All right, go.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.689
-No.
-I'm telling you to do it.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.691
I don't need you
to tell me what to do, Dennis.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.214
I'm going to make
my own decision.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.825
Oh, Mac, now is not
the time for this...

21:44.868 --> 21:47.567
Charlie, shut up!
I'm done with your plans.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.612
-She ain't moving, man.
-She wanted to see
the other side,

21:49.656 --> 21:53.224
and I want Dennis to seethat I can make my own decision.

21:53.268 --> 21:57.011
Oh, my God!What is wrong with you people?!

21:57.054 --> 21:58.969
Okay.

21:59.013 --> 22:01.624
Uh... Ah.

22:05.019 --> 22:06.412
I saw it!

22:06.455 --> 22:07.978
I saw the other side.
I didn't like it.

22:08.022 --> 22:09.371
I hated it.
It was just blackness.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.720
There's nothing there.
It's just dark.

22:10.764 --> 22:12.374
That's it. Just lights out.I don't want to do that anymore.

22:12.418 --> 22:13.506
I don't want to live
on the edge.

22:13.549 --> 22:15.508
I don't want to die.
