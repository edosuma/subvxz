Hey, can I get a--

01:18.948 --> 01:20.047
Hello?

01:20.148 --> 01:21.548
I got a flat.

01:21.649 --> 01:22.849
Where are you?

01:22.884 --> 01:24.850
Close. I'm on Oak.

01:24.884 --> 01:26.551
Are you ok?
Did you call AAA?

01:26.652 --> 01:28.552
I know how to change
a tire, Mom.

01:28.653 --> 01:31.787
- I'm coming.
- Oh, good idea.

01:31.855 --> 01:32.988
Take your car.

01:33.055 --> 01:34.856
Oh, wait--
it has a flat.

01:34.957 --> 01:37.290
Then I will walk
or catch a cab.

01:37.358 --> 01:40.261
Like you know how to change
a tire. I got it.

01:40.263 --> 01:43.897
Well, then, I'll stand there and
watch you do it, smarty-pants.

You'd just been born when

It was hard

I think she wanted
to start over.

I stole it from her.

07:31.709 --> 07:33.410
You ready for
school tomorrow?

I'm Principal Chamberlain.
I knew your mother.

08:55.695 --> 08:57.896
I guess she didn't talk
about me much.

08:57.931 --> 09:02.134
Well, she never really talked
about her life here.

09:03.937 --> 09:06.805
Your mother was...
very special to me.

that I can do

Hey. Have you
seen her yet?

09:22.120 --> 09:23.520
She got in yesterday.

09:25.323 --> 09:26.723
And?

09:26.824 --> 09:28.759
She got in yesterday.

09:59.457 --> 10:01.458
So, you're the new girl.

10:01.492 --> 10:03.794
Uh, yeah.
That's me.

11:16.664 --> 11:19.733
I'm sorry.

You knew my mom?

Your mother chose him.

Still...

at school today.

12:33.607 --> 12:34.707
Ah.

12:34.742 --> 12:35.742
How was
your first day?

12:35.810 --> 12:38.844

- What? It's true.

12:53.359 --> 12:55.626

Nice to meet you.

12:55.727 --> 12:57.728

Faye Chambelin.

12:57.763 --> 12:59.130

13:04.769 --> 13:06.570
And your father?
Where's he?

13:06.637 --> 13:09.172
Well, he died
just after I was born.

13:09.239 --> 13:10.540
My father's dad dead,
too.

13:10.641 --> 13:12.842
I still have
my mother, though.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.443
You probably met her.
She's the principal.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.045
Do not let her smile
fool you.

13:17.147 --> 13:19.081
She can be bitchy.

13:20.049 --> 13:23.152
Adam's cute,
don't you think?

13:23.253 --> 13:28.158
And he really does go for
the sad, delicate types.

13:30.595 --> 13:33.664
You know, I'm not feeling
all that delicate right now,

13:33.699 --> 13:34.566
so, I think
I'm gonna go.

13:34.600 --> 13:40.171

what happened.

14:59.007 --> 15:01.074

on fire.

15:01.109 --> 15:03.577

We can't control it.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.497
Then we should tell her.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.366
No. She needs time.
She just lost her mother.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.468
Look, we all agreed
to take it slow.

18:12.503 --> 18:15.471
No, you said to take it slow,
and we all nodded.

18:15.505 --> 18:16.572
I never agreed
to anything.

18:16.673 --> 18:18.374
We are doing this
my way, Faye.

18:18.408 --> 18:21.176
Yeah.
That ship has sailed.

18:21.277 --> 18:24.012
Do not push me, Faye.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.680
I mean it.

18:28.784 --> 18:30.718
Mmm.

18:30.786 --> 18:32.086
Do you want
to try that again?

18:32.120 --> 18:35.589
'Cause I didn't
quite buy it. Did you?

18:39.394 --> 18:41.896
Good night, Diana.

19:29.862 --> 19:31.697
Grandma?

19:48.205 --> 19:52.304
- Ooh. Sorry. My bad.
- No. That was my fault.

19:52.987 --> 19:55.721
Are you Cassie Blake?

19:55.789 --> 19:58.290
Yes.

19:59.726 --> 20:01.593
I was a good friend of
your mother's. I'm Charles.

20:01.628 --> 20:06.131
I'm so very, very sorry
to hear about her accident.

20:06.199 --> 20:07.799
Thank you.

20:07.834 --> 20:10.402
Cassie! Hey.
I see you met my dad.

20:10.503 --> 20:13.038
Oh. Hi.

20:13.105 --> 20:15.240
Well, it was very nice
to meet you, Cassie.

20:15.308 --> 20:17.409
You girls have fun.
See you at home.

20:21.214 --> 20:23.415
How are you doing
after yesterday?

20:23.516 --> 20:24.749
Not great,
actually.

20:24.817 --> 20:26.250
Anything I can do?

20:26.318 --> 20:27.918
Have you seen
my grandmother?

20:28.067 --> 20:30.802
Um, no.
Something wrong?

20:30.827 --> 20:32.857
I have no idea.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.125
Try me.

20:35.226 --> 20:37.227
Do you know how my car
caught on fire?

20:37.328 --> 20:38.862
I'm sure a mechanic
could tell you.

20:38.929 --> 20:42.631
Forget it. It's just number one
on my list of crazy.

20:42.732 --> 20:43.565
What do you mean?

20:43.633 --> 20:45.367
This town is
a friggin' side show.

20:45.435 --> 20:48.470
I mean--look. Never mind.
It's not your problem.

20:48.538 --> 20:51.373
I just--
I need to find my grandmother.

20:55.946 --> 20:58.448
Cassie, wait.

20:58.549 --> 21:01.351
I think maybe
I can help.

21:03.656 --> 21:05.390
Hello, Dawn.

21:05.458 --> 21:07.259
Hi, Jane. How are yo?

21:07.360 --> 21:09.261
How's Cassie, by the way?
She's a lovely girl.

21:09.295 --> 21:10.963
Actually, I wanted to
talk to you about her.

21:10.965 --> 21:11.896
I don't know if you heard.

21:11.921 --> 21:13.453
Cassie's car caught fire 
last night.

21:13.666 --> 21:16.702
Actually, I oh, my God.
Is she ok?

21:16.770 --> 21:18.470
She's fine.

21:18.571 --> 21:21.774
It's what caused the fire
that concerns me.

21:21.875 --> 21:25.810
I seem to recall a similar thing
happening years ago--

21:25.878 --> 21:28.580
kids fooling around...

21:29.782 --> 21:33.185
We both know
how that ended.

21:33.219 --> 21:34.887
Are the children
practicing?

21:35.106 --> 21:36.407
Oh, they can't be.

21:36.432 --> 21:37.632
I mean, they don't know
anything.

21:37.924 --> 21:39.091
They're teenagers.

21:39.192 --> 21:41.293
You better than
anyone should know

21:41.327 --> 21:42.695
how resourceful they can be.

21:42.729 --> 21:44.096
I would never have
allowed Cassie here--

21:44.197 --> 21:46.132
Look, I'm around
these kids every day.

21:46.199 --> 21:47.634
If they were practicing,
I would know.

21:47.735 --> 21:49.535
We can't let it
happen again.

21:49.603 --> 21:53.707
Look, if I see or hear anything,
I will let you know.

21:53.808 --> 21:55.442
Promise.

22:00.349 --> 22:01.649
Where are we going?

22:01.717 --> 22:03.618
You'll see.

22:10.125 --> 22:12.960
It's ok, Cassie.

22:24.639 --> 22:26.873
What is this place?

22:28.842 --> 22:41.486
Come on.

22:41.553 --> 22:43.754
Finally.

22:51.898 --> 22:53.565
Hey
neighbor.

22:55.701 --> 22:57.602
I'm Nick,

22:57.670 --> 22:59.470
also known as the guy in
the window.

23:01.373 --> 23:02.473
Hi.

23:02.575 --> 23:05.076
Ok. What are all of you
doing here?

23:05.111 --> 23:06.311
What's going on?

23:06.379 --> 23:07.780
We want to explain.

23:07.814 --> 23:09.381
I didn't want to
tell you like this,

23:09.415 --> 23:10.716
but I didn't have
a choice--

23:10.784 --> 23:12.018
She has
a right to know.

23:12.085 --> 23:13.386
Know what?

23:15.522 --> 23:16.923
Who you are.

23:18.692 --> 23:20.393
Ok. This is getting
really weird. I--

23:20.427 --> 23:22.495
Hey, you don't have
to be scared.

23:22.596 --> 23:23.930
Somebody tell me
what's going on.

23:23.997 --> 23:25.097
Look, Cassie,

23:25.132 --> 23:28.133
I know this is going to
sound crazy, ok, but...

23:28.201 --> 23:30.903
that fire yesterday...

23:31.004 --> 23:34.005
I don't know
how to say this. Um...

23:34.040 --> 23:37.409
We're different.
You're different.

23:37.411 --> 23:39.711
Oh, for God's sake,
spit it out.

23:39.745 --> 23:41.467
You're a witch.

23:41.492 --> 23:42.692
You're a full-blooded,
100% witch.

23:43.650 --> 23:45.417
We all are.

23:45.451 --> 23:47.953
There. Done.

23:52.837 --> 23:55.867
- This is beyond crazy.
- The truth works that way.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.235
Cassie, I know
how this sounds.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.537
The truth is, our ancestry is
part of a legacy

23:59.638 --> 24:02.040
that dates as far back
as 1692.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.776
You guys are saying
I'm a witch.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.677
Like your mother
and her mother.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.946
It's all in here,
Cassie.

24:07.981 --> 24:10.749
Each family has a book
like this one,

24:10.850 --> 24:12.851
a journal that lays down
each family line.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.252
I found mine--

24:14.286 --> 24:16.788
Which explains
her air of superiority.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.356
The book contains
thousands of spells.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.957
We've been practicing,
but without a full circle,

24:20.058 --> 24:21.659
we can only do
really lame ones.

24:21.694 --> 24:23.795
Like open locked doors.
Or curtains.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.163
Or set cars
on fire.

24:25.265 --> 24:27.266
I'm sorry about that.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.269
- I got a little out of hand.
- Complete circle is 6--

24:30.303 --> 24:31.704
one from each of
the 6 families.

24:31.772 --> 24:34.073
You're the sixth.
You complete the circle.

24:34.107 --> 24:36.408
- Now we're whole.
- We have more power now.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.310
But there's a ritual
that will bind us

24:38.378 --> 24:39.912
so we can control
our power.

24:39.979 --> 24:43.281
You are seriously messed up.
Get out of my way.

24:43.382 --> 24:46.017
Don't pretend
you don't believe us.

24:46.085 --> 24:47.485
Deep down,
you know it's true.

24:47.586 --> 24:49.420
What's true is
how crazy you are.

24:49.487 --> 24:50.887
Hey, take it easy.

24:50.922 --> 24:52.222
She can't just waltz
out of here.

24:52.290 --> 24:53.623
She'll run
to her grandmother.

24:53.691 --> 24:55.892
No one can know about us,
not even our families.

24:55.993 --> 24:57.194
We have to stay secret.

24:57.228 --> 24:59.096
Fine.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.535
Great.
I knew it.

25:04.603 --> 25:06.904
Nicely done, Diana.

25:16.216 --> 25:19.619
Cassie! Cassie, wait.

25:19.720 --> 25:21.354
It's not as crazy
as it seems.

25:21.421 --> 25:24.357
Yes, it is. This is insane.
All of you are insane.

25:24.424 --> 25:26.358
Our parents had a circle
just like ours.

25:26.426 --> 25:28.727
Oh, my God.
Can you hear yourself?

25:28.761 --> 25:30.462
My mother was not a witch.
I would have known.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.731
No, 'cause it was
all covered up,

25:32.832 --> 25:35.567
'cause something went wrong.
People were hurt.

25:35.634 --> 25:37.936
They were killed.
So they abolished witchcraft.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.738
I don't believe you.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.543
You're not the only one who's
lost a parent, Cassie.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.279
We all have.

25:48.649 --> 25:50.551
There's no such thing
as witches and magic.

25:50.652 --> 25:52.352
I don't believe it.

25:52.387 --> 25:55.389
I can't.

25:56.692 --> 25:58.359
Let me show you.

26:11.472 --> 26:13.206
Here.

26:17.677 --> 26:20.412
It's ok. Trust me.

26:21.815 --> 26:23.715
Close your eyes.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.487
Ok. Now, concentrate

26:29.588 --> 26:31.889
on how your hand
is connecting with the leaf,

26:31.990 --> 26:34.792
then how the leaf
is connecting with the water,

26:34.826 --> 26:36.627
and say,

26:36.695 --> 26:39.030
"A drop of water,
as light as air,"

26:39.097 --> 26:40.532
and keep repeating it.

26:40.599 --> 26:44.837
A drop of water,
as light as air.

26:44.904 --> 26:47.907
A drop of water,
as light as air.

26:48.008 --> 26:51.611
A drop of water,
as light as air.

26:53.114 --> 26:54.815
I don't feel anything.

26:59.653 --> 27:00.920
Feel that?

27:01.021 --> 27:05.124
That tingling when my hand is
touching yours?

27:05.225 --> 27:08.427
That's your energy
connecting with mine.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.629
Now, try again.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.734
A drop of water...

27:16.835 --> 27:18.836
As light as air.

27:18.871 --> 27:22.573
A drop of water,
as light as air.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.644
A drop of water,
as light as air

27:43.263 --> 27:44.897
Are you doing this?

27:50.670 --> 27:52.204
We are.

27:57.076 --> 27:59.277
This has never
happened before.

28:22.282 --> 28:23.382
You did magic with her?

28:25.254 --> 28:27.352
I thought if she knew what
she was capable of,

28:27.353 --> 28:28.720
she wouldn't be
as afraid of it.

28:28.754 --> 28:31.555
You made water float?
How romantic.

28:31.623 --> 28:33.824
And then, you let her
just run away.

28:33.925 --> 28:35.460
I lost control.

28:35.527 --> 28:36.628
Sounds like it.

28:36.729 --> 28:38.530
No, I lost control
of the magic.

28:38.564 --> 28:41.010
With Cassie here, 
our power is magnified

28:41.035 --> 28:42.335
a hundred times over.

28:42.368 --> 28:44.136
Which is why we need to perform
the ritual.

28:44.170 --> 28:45.371
Yeah, and the sooner,
the better,

28:45.438 --> 28:46.872
before she blabs
to her grandmother

28:46.940 --> 28:48.474
and anyone else
that would listen.

28:48.541 --> 28:49.545
She's not going to tell anybody.

28:49.570 --> 28:50.770
Oh, and he would know.

28:51.004 --> 28:52.547
They made magic together.

28:52.572 --> 28:55.159
All right, I'll swing by
her grandmother's.

28:55.548 --> 28:58.050
You guys have fun.

28:58.084 --> 29:00.085
- I certainly will.
- Where are you going?

29:00.153 --> 29:01.853
We have
to find Cassie.

29:01.954 --> 29:03.688
I'm not interested in
your little ritual.

29:03.756 --> 29:04.809
We have real power now.

29:04.834 --> 29:06.534
The last thing I want
to do is control it.

29:06.591 --> 29:08.392
And I'm not going to.

29:08.459 --> 29:11.661
This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

29:11.696 --> 29:13.363
You know
what she's like.

29:13.464 --> 29:15.399
Let's just find Cassie.

29:33.387 --> 29:36.489
Hello, Amelia's girl.

29:38.491 --> 29:40.192
Why did my mom
leave here?

29:41.827 --> 29:45.129
You said you loved her.
What happened?

29:45.197 --> 29:46.497
Your father happened.

29:46.598 --> 29:49.100
Tell me about him.

29:49.201 --> 29:53.504
Do you know that our families
are aligned in the stars?

29:53.506 --> 29:55.507
Me and Amelia were meant
for each other.

29:55.541 --> 29:57.108
Yeah, you keep saying that,

29:57.143 --> 29:59.044
but I don't understand.
What does that mean?

29:59.112 --> 30:01.313
It's the same
for you and Adam.

30:03.317 --> 30:06.953
You don't want
to mess with fate.

30:07.021 --> 30:09.322
Bad things happen
when you mess with fate.

30:09.357 --> 30:14.128
What bad things?
Tell me.

30:14.162 --> 30:16.129
Why do you want to hurt
more than you already do?

30:16.230 --> 30:19.466
Please.

30:24.538 --> 30:26.438
Your father was
a bad man.

30:26.539 --> 30:28.840
Hello, Ethan.

30:28.942 --> 30:30.542
Is he bothering you?

30:30.643 --> 30:32.277
We're just talkin,
Charlie.

30:32.344 --> 30:33.645
It looks like you've had a little
too much to drink.

30:33.679 --> 30:35.980
Oh, I'm fine.

30:37.149 --> 30:38.682
Why don't we call it
a night?

30:41.352 --> 30:42.552
Ok, look.
We were just talking.

30:42.654 --> 30:44.888
What's going on?

30:47.359 --> 30:49.660
Your dad's in
a bad way again.

30:49.695 --> 30:51.396
Dad. Hey.

30:51.463 --> 30:53.365
We're gonna

by it... ♪

31:46.919 --> 31:48.653
Skies above...

31:48.720 --> 31:51.822
give me a sign.

31:55.327 --> 31:56.728
Cassie.
There you are.

31:56.762 --> 31:59.431
No. I can't deal with
any more of this now.

31:59.465 --> 32:03.669
I know you're scared.
I know it's a lot to accept.

32:03.736 --> 32:05.037
Please.

32:05.071 --> 32:06.372
What happened to our parents,

32:06.439 --> 32:08.841
and why won't anyone
tell me anything?

32:11.378 --> 32:14.747
There was an accident
16 years ago.

32:14.848 --> 32:17.650
The people who died were all
members of the last circle,

32:17.684 --> 32:19.552
our parents.

32:21.288 --> 32:23.155
My father, too?

32:25.759 --> 32:27.960
Only I don't think
it was an accident.

32:27.994 --> 32:29.595
I think
something went wrong,

32:29.663 --> 32:32.198
and the ones who survived are
trying to keep it from us.

32:32.266 --> 32:38.170
Look, I believe we can do
great things with our power.

32:38.205 --> 32:41.107
It doesn't have to be bad,
but we have to control it.

32:41.174 --> 32:44.176
My mom ran
from this life.

32:44.277 --> 32:45.711
She didn't want this
for me.

32:45.779 --> 32:47.780
If she did, she would have told .

32:53.987 --> 32:57.189
Why didn't she tell me?

32:59.692 --> 33:02.395
I don't know, Cassie.

33:15.544 --> 33:18.345
Please, sky,
rain down on me.

33:29.058 --> 33:31.026
More!

33:34.029 --> 33:35.930
What is she doing?

33:43.372 --> 33:46.074
Faye!
What are you doing?

33:46.142 --> 33:47.375
It's beautiful!

33:47.443 --> 33:49.377
You can't make it rain
just 'cause you want to!

33:49.445 --> 33:51.346
Yes, we can!

33:51.380 --> 33:52.780
We can do
anything we want!

33:52.848 --> 33:55.349
No, Faye!
Make it stop!

33:59.955 --> 34:02.056
Diana!
Are you ok?

34:02.157 --> 34:03.858
You have to stop it!

34:03.892 --> 34:05.659
Ok, I will!

34:05.693 --> 34:07.461
Stop this storm.

34:07.562 --> 34:10.397
Stop this storm!

34:10.464 --> 34:12.264
Do it!
I can't! I--

34:12.299 --> 34:15.969
Stop it!
Stop this storm!

34:22.010 --> 34:24.579
Make it stop.

34:24.612 --> 34:27.181
Make it stop.

34:27.282 --> 34:29.717
Make it stop.

34:50.904 --> 34:54.507
You did it.
You're one of us.

34:54.608 --> 34:56.442
You stopped it, Cassie.

34:58.412 --> 35:00.313
I don't want
any part of this.

35:19.876 --> 35:21.176
What happened to you?

35:23.580 --> 35:26.783
I--I just got caught
in the rain.

35:26.817 --> 35:29.686
Is everything all right?

35:31.722 --> 35:33.068
Yeah. I just--
I want to get out

35:33.093 --> 35:34.293
of these clothes.

35:47.703 --> 35:49.404
We're closed.

35:54.343 --> 35:55.810
We have a problem,
Ethan.

35:55.911 --> 35:58.046
What?

35:58.114 --> 36:01.149
You drink too much, which makes
you talk too much,

36:01.217 --> 36:02.517
and I can't have
that.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.553
What the hell
are you doing here?

36:06.356 --> 36:08.104
What would happen
if you slipped and fell

36:08.129 --> 36:09.986
off that dock outside?

36:10.427 --> 36:13.429
You'd drown.

36:13.463 --> 36:17.232
No one would find
your body for days.

36:17.333 --> 36:19.334
And do you know
what drowning is like?

36:19.435 --> 36:22.037
That feeling of not
being able to breathe?

36:24.674 --> 36:26.575
Gasping for air?

36:28.277 --> 36:32.547
Panicked as your lungs
fill up with water?

36:36.886 --> 36:38.853
It's a horrible death.

36:40.890 --> 36:43.158
This is my one
and final warning.

36:55.369 --> 36:58.204
Cassie?
You have a visitor.

36:58.272 --> 37:01.507
A very late visitor.

37:06.579 --> 37:08.079
I'll be in the kitchen.

37:08.114 --> 37:12.116
Right through there.

37:18.191 --> 37:20.392
Diana told me
what happened.

37:20.493 --> 37:21.693
Are they ok?

37:21.727 --> 37:24.396
Um, Faye's
a little shaken,

37:24.430 --> 37:26.231
and Diana's worried.

37:26.299 --> 37:30.802
Faye has always been
a bit unpredictable.

37:30.903 --> 37:32.604
You never know what she's
going to do next.

37:32.705 --> 37:34.607
Is that
why you came here,

37:34.708 --> 37:36.909
to convince me to join
your secret cult?

37:37.010 --> 37:38.611
No.

37:38.645 --> 37:40.513
I just wanted
to apologize.

37:41.949 --> 37:44.717
I'm sorry
about earlier.

37:44.752 --> 37:47.153
Which part?

37:49.423 --> 37:51.057
In the woods.

37:53.327 --> 37:54.428
I--I know.

37:54.529 --> 37:55.929
It should never
have happened.

37:56.030 --> 37:58.332
I don't know
how it happened.

37:58.433 --> 38:00.234
I love Diana,
you know.

38:00.268 --> 38:01.735
Yeah, I get it.

38:04.271 --> 38:05.939
Can't happen again.

38:08.842 --> 38:10.443
It can't.

38:17.184 --> 38:19.352
- Well, I should go.
- Yeah.

38:23.659 --> 38:25.260
You are one of us,
Cassie.

38:25.361 --> 38:28.363
I can't tell you
what to do,

38:28.397 --> 38:34.169
but just know...
You're not alone.

38:44.779 --> 38:46.814
Ahem.

39:02.529 --> 39:03.829
You and your tricks.

39:03.897 --> 39:05.097
They come in handy.

39:05.131 --> 39:08.000
Mmm. Ethan?

39:08.034 --> 39:09.901
- We spoke.
- Good.

39:09.935 --> 39:14.006
We did the right thing
bringing her here.

39:14.040 --> 39:15.607
She's got the gift.

39:15.708 --> 39:16.908
She is her father's
daughter.

39:17.010 --> 39:19.845
Unfortunately,
she's her mother's daughter, too.

39:19.912 --> 39:24.717
Are you sure you can get Cassie
to do what we need?

39:24.751 --> 39:27.519
I don't have to get her
to do a thing.

39:27.620 --> 39:31.157
The circle will take care of that
without even knowing it.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.427
You finding this means
I'm gone,

41:12.528 --> 41:14.429
and for that,
I am so sorry.

41:14.463 --> 41:18.133
I didn't want you
to have this life.

41:18.167 --> 41:21.636
But destiny's not easy
to run from.

41:21.671 --> 41:24.539
I hoped that keeping this secret
would keep you safe,

41:24.640 --> 41:27.643
but all I've done is
left you unprotected.

41:27.744 --> 41:30.946
You have incredible power
inside you.

41:31.047 --> 41:33.282
People will come for it.

41:33.350 --> 41:35.484
They will come for you.
