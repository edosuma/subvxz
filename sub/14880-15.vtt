Previously
on <i>Covert Affairs...</i>

00:01.617 --> 00:03.018
Major James Wylde.

00:03.020 --> 00:04.786
You lost something
very valuable in combat, son.

00:04.788 --> 00:07.123
You can join us on the next tour
of Operation Proper Exit.

00:07.228 --> 00:09.497
You'd be a great inspiration
to your fellow warriors.

00:09.499 --> 00:10.732
Call Petersburg Prison

00:10.734 --> 00:12.568
and tell them I want to sit down
with Henry Wilcox

00:12.570 --> 00:13.870
as soon as possible.

00:13.872 --> 00:15.439
Just give me one good reason
to trust you right now.

00:15.441 --> 00:17.742
The question is, can you use
me to complete your mission?

00:17.744 --> 00:20.446
You doctored the photos
of al Masri, not Mossad.

00:20.448 --> 00:22.783
I'm giving you one last chance
to save our friendship.

00:22.785 --> 00:24.752
You didn't tell me that you
needed to know where Khalid was

00:24.754 --> 00:26.921
so that you could drop
a missile on him.

00:26.923 --> 00:28.958
Now tell me again about
the woman who approached you.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.293
Her name is Annie Walker.

00:33.198 --> 00:35.433
So, if you throw out
all the obvious mismatches--

00:35.435 --> 00:37.902
wrong age, wrong ethnicity,
wrong sex--

00:37.904 --> 00:39.870
plus, all the people
who've returned back to America

00:39.872 --> 00:40.938
accounted for,

00:40.940 --> 00:42.874
that's only
43 possible aliases

00:42.876 --> 00:46.111
Megan could have
traveled under.

00:46.113 --> 00:48.581
I've been going on and on
about this, haven't I?

00:48.583 --> 00:50.083
I don't know.
What day is it again?

00:50.085 --> 00:52.887
[Both chuckle]
Sorry. You asked me here

00:52.889 --> 00:54.623
'cause you obviously
want to talk about something.

00:54.625 --> 00:56.892
What makes you think I want
to talk to you about something?

00:56.894 --> 00:58.227
'Cause we have been talking
about coming here

00:58.229 --> 00:59.295
for a hang and a chat

00:59.297 --> 01:01.131
since the day I got back
from Russia.

01:01.133 --> 01:04.135
- Oh, yeah.
- So here we are, finally.

01:06.071 --> 01:07.940
What's on your mind?

01:07.942 --> 01:11.277
I, uh...

01:11.279 --> 01:12.745
[Clears throat]

01:13.147 --> 01:16.417
I'm deploying
to Iraq tomorrow.

01:16.419 --> 01:17.652
Operation Proper Exit--

01:17.654 --> 01:19.254
they've assigned me
as a battle buddy

01:19.256 --> 01:20.689
to PFC Pete Downey.

01:20.691 --> 01:24.327
He's from Smyrna, Delaware--
post-traumatic stress.

01:24.329 --> 01:26.363
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

01:26.365 --> 01:28.065
"Battle buddy" sounds like we're
going on a field trip

01:28.067 --> 01:29.233
to the science museum.

01:29.235 --> 01:30.935
But that's
what they call it, so...

01:30.937 --> 01:32.269
You're leaving tomorrow
for Iraq?

01:32.271 --> 01:34.572
Yeah, sorry.
The timing's not great.

01:34.574 --> 01:36.073
Joan's out of the office and...

01:36.075 --> 01:37.908
When did you find out
about this?

01:37.910 --> 01:39.744
Ten days ago.

01:39.746 --> 01:41.412
This has all happened so fast,

01:41.414 --> 01:43.081
and you've been literally
running for your life.

01:43.083 --> 01:44.616
It hasn't been easy trying

01:44.618 --> 01:46.251
to find the right time
to tell you.

01:46.253 --> 01:49.088
No, that doesn't matter.

01:49.090 --> 01:51.524
It's great.

01:51.526 --> 01:54.261
I think you will definitely
get something out of it.

01:54.263 --> 01:56.430
Yeah, well, I'm just serving
when called upon.

01:56.432 --> 01:57.465
It's a quick trip.

01:57.467 --> 01:59.434
Regardless, it's a journey.

01:59.436 --> 02:01.736
And every journey should begin
with a toast.

02:01.738 --> 02:03.905
What toast do you give
to a deploying soldier?

02:03.907 --> 02:06.242
[Chuckles]
You can say anything you like,

02:06.244 --> 02:08.745
just not "break a leg."

02:08.747 --> 02:11.448
Okay,
why don't we just go with...

02:11.450 --> 02:14.418
"Good luck, battle buddy"?

02:22.294 --> 02:24.129
[Telephone rings]

02:24.131 --> 02:25.330
Yeah.

02:25.332 --> 02:28.467
Can we talk?

02:28.469 --> 02:31.304
Is that you, Barber?

02:31.306 --> 02:32.438
Uh, yeah.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.941
This isn't exactly discreet.

02:34.943 --> 02:36.410
Oh, okay.

02:36.412 --> 02:37.945
[Telephone hangs up]

02:43.485 --> 02:46.487
So, um, remember the other day

02:46.489 --> 02:48.023
when you asked me
to keep a lookout

02:48.025 --> 02:50.325
for any hits on Megan Carr?
Yeah.

02:50.327 --> 02:52.194
They found her body

02:52.196 --> 02:54.330
in a hotel room in Luxembourg,

02:54.332 --> 02:57.967
strangled.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.003
Is this a list
of her personal effects?

03:00.005 --> 03:01.538
Yeah, according to the morgue,

03:01.540 --> 03:03.340
just a carry-on suitcase,
wallet,

03:03.342 --> 03:04.875
credit cards,
a couple bracelets.

03:04.877 --> 03:06.611
- And a flash drive.
- Yeah.

03:06.613 --> 03:07.981
- What do you think's on it?
- I don't know.

03:07.983 --> 03:11.019
But there's always something
on a flash drive, right?

03:11.021 --> 03:12.721
Have they notified
her family yet?

03:12.723 --> 03:16.191
Uh, just a sister,
and they can't reach her.

03:16.193 --> 03:17.559
Thanks, Barber.

03:17.561 --> 03:19.027
You know,
you can call me Eric.

03:19.029 --> 03:20.128
That's my first name.

03:20.130 --> 03:22.230
We've been working
together awhile.

03:22.232 --> 03:23.899
- Hey, Eric.
- Yeah?

03:23.901 --> 03:25.533
You know how
to make a fake I.D.?

03:25.535 --> 03:27.336
[Chuckles]

03:27.338 --> 03:31.174
I went to prep school, so...

03:31.176 --> 03:34.378

any identification?

- What kind of assistance?
- I've been targeted.

06:12.974 --> 06:15.041
I need
an immediate extraction.

06:15.043 --> 06:16.710
Let me initiate
an action plan.

06:16.712 --> 06:19.045
I'll have an extraction point
within the half hour.

a tranq dart shot at my head.

06:21.717 --> 06:23.517

as I have more information.

06:25.888 --> 06:27.554

would walk me through this

to get you out of there,

at the same time.

07:30.452 --> 07:32.786
I wasn't expecting
to hear from you, maybe ever.

07:32.788 --> 07:34.721
Well, I didn't expect
to be fleeing Luxembourg City.

07:34.723 --> 07:36.757
What's, uh, your best bet
for a way out of here?

07:36.759 --> 07:38.959
- What's going on?
- Khalid's men are after me.

07:38.961 --> 07:40.227
How do you know?

07:40.229 --> 07:41.929
It was reported
that Megan Carr was killed.

07:41.931 --> 07:43.564
It was a trap.

the best way out of there.

I'm in a car.

07:49.305 --> 07:50.438
Take the E25 south to Metz,

07:50.440 --> 07:52.140
but don't cross
the border there.

07:52.142 --> 07:53.808
Take surface streets
into France.

07:53.810 --> 07:55.443

to do with Zamir Gerson.

and confirmed the location

to know for now

was not a failure.

12:20.215 --> 12:21.514
don't be.

12:21.516 --> 12:24.384
He and his old man, Omar,
are dirtier than dirt--

12:24.386 --> 12:25.685
always have been.

12:25.687 --> 12:29.389
State just can't get off
the oil train.

12:31.092 --> 12:33.226
Guard!

12:37.932 --> 12:39.733
Don't worry.

12:39.735 --> 12:43.237
You'll come up
smelling like a rose, Arthur.

12:43.239 --> 12:46.072
I've been assured.

12:47.742 --> 12:50.743
You'll see.

13:20.575 --> 13:23.678
[Keypad beeping]

13:26.615 --> 13:29.617
[Elevator bell dings]

13:43.298 --> 13:46.267
[Door creaks]

13:51.474 --> 13:54.442
[Door closes]

13:56.612 --> 13:58.847
Eyal?

14:02.318 --> 14:05.153
[Sighs]
I wasn't sure you were coming.

14:05.155 --> 14:07.189
I tried to reach you.
I dumped my phone.

14:07.191 --> 14:09.791
I didn't want
anyone tracking me.

14:12.662 --> 14:16.198
Listen, I contacted
a cobbler I know.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.767
He'll have
a nice clean passport

14:17.769 --> 14:18.968
by noon today--

14:18.970 --> 14:21.337
get you on a plane back home.

14:21.339 --> 14:23.605
I'm not going home,
not yet.

14:23.607 --> 14:25.674
You told me the last time
we were in Zurich,

14:25.676 --> 14:28.178
it doesn't matter
if I can trust you or not.

14:28.180 --> 14:31.347
It only matters if I can use you
to complete my mission.

14:31.349 --> 14:34.351
What are you proposing?

14:34.353 --> 14:36.353
Khalid tried
to take me alive.

14:36.355 --> 14:40.023
As long as he's after me,
I'm not ever gonna feel safe.

14:40.025 --> 14:44.361
I have to get to him
before he gets to me.

14:44.363 --> 14:46.863
Can I use you?

14:46.865 --> 14:48.398
Use me.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.243
Tranq dart.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.472
Yeah.

14:55.900 --> 14:58.402
They went to a lot of trouble to
set up that trap at the morgue.

14:58.404 --> 15:00.804
And I fell right for it.
Oh.

15:00.806 --> 15:02.306
Megan probably I.D.'d you
to Khalid.

15:02.308 --> 15:04.742
Or Cole did.
Who knows?

15:04.744 --> 15:06.643
What I'm trying
to figure out is,

15:06.645 --> 15:08.612
why does he want me alive?

15:08.614 --> 15:10.113
Maybe he wants
to say he's sorry

15:10.115 --> 15:12.115
for all the trouble
he's causing, in person.

15:12.117 --> 15:13.784
How many men did he have
after you?

15:13.786 --> 15:15.286
At least three
that I engaged with.

15:15.288 --> 15:16.654
But there were more.
Hmm.

15:16.656 --> 15:17.789
That's a lot of salary
to pay

15:17.791 --> 15:19.224
for a man who's gone
into hiding,

15:19.226 --> 15:21.126
plus food and drink
and a roof over his head,

15:21.128 --> 15:22.260
and who knows how much
in hush money

15:22.262 --> 15:23.595
to keep his location a secret.

15:23.597 --> 15:25.998
We checked. All Khalid's
accounts are frozen.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.800
He cannot move money
electronically.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.935
I know.
Why do you think I'm in Zurich?

15:29.937 --> 15:31.637
You're not the only one
who's got unfinished business

15:31.639 --> 15:33.305
with Khalid Ansari.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.307
Put yourself
in Khalid's shoes.

15:36.309 --> 15:37.642
You're a fugitive
on the run.

15:37.644 --> 15:39.577
It's very difficult
to communicate with anyone.

15:39.579 --> 15:41.312
You have no access to money.

15:41.314 --> 15:43.281
Who do you reach out to?

15:43.283 --> 15:45.350
- Daddy.
- Omar Ansari.

15:45.352 --> 15:48.986
I arrived here last Tuesday,
started my surveillance.

15:48.988 --> 15:50.187
He's here on business,

15:50.189 --> 15:51.856
finalizing a deal
with the Chinese.

15:51.858 --> 15:54.759
He's very meticulous
about his movements, watchful.

15:54.761 --> 15:56.661
You can tell
that he knows something

15:56.663 --> 15:58.629
about countersurveillance.
What are you saying?

15:58.631 --> 16:00.164
I'm saying
he's behaving like a man

16:00.166 --> 16:01.432
who's got something to hide.

16:01.434 --> 16:03.434
Last Thursday,
9:00 a.m. on the dot,

16:03.436 --> 16:05.970
I get a call from my contact
at Credit Suisse.

16:05.972 --> 16:08.639
Tells me Omar's requested
a sum of cash--

16:08.641 --> 16:11.709
50,000 Euros
in various denominations,

16:11.711 --> 16:13.111
all unmarked bills.

16:13.113 --> 16:15.514
Three hours later,
he enters Club au Lac for lunch,

16:15.516 --> 16:17.682
with a satchel of money.

16:17.684 --> 16:20.019
An hour after that,
he comes out by himself,

16:20.021 --> 16:22.789
enters his car--
no satchel.

16:22.791 --> 16:24.124
So he must be transferring
the funds

16:24.126 --> 16:25.358
to Khalid
through a courier.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.893
But you didn't see
who he passed it to.

16:26.895 --> 16:28.362
No. Too many people going
in and out,

16:28.364 --> 16:29.730
too many ways to hide it.

16:29.732 --> 16:31.465
Are you sure the handoff's
gonna go down again

16:31.467 --> 16:32.633
at Club au Lac?

16:32.635 --> 16:34.669
Positive. We have
to get eyes in there.

16:34.671 --> 16:36.337
But even my assets can't get in.

16:36.339 --> 16:38.572
- The security's too tight?
- Not for club members.

16:38.574 --> 16:40.875
50,000 is not gonna last
Khalid very long.

16:40.877 --> 16:42.410
About a week.

16:42.412 --> 16:43.878
Today is Thursday.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.214
It's 9:00 a.m. on the dot.

16:46.216 --> 16:49.851
[Cell phone ringing]

16:59.028 --> 17:01.062
One thing you got
to love about the Swiss--

17:01.064 --> 17:02.397
they're all so punctual.

17:02.399 --> 17:04.098
Another 50,000?

17:04.099 --> 17:05.767
250,000 this time.

17:05.769 --> 17:07.401
His expenses are going up.

17:07.403 --> 17:08.903
Or he's going deeper
into hiding.

17:08.905 --> 17:11.571
We might never get
this chance again.

17:11.574 --> 17:13.574
All right, come on.
My car is parked out back.

17:13.576 --> 17:17.178
- Where are we going?
- To collect our club dues.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.949
All of you
have been here before--

17:21.951 --> 17:23.784
Hero's highway,

17:23.786 --> 17:26.554
the pathway
to the medevac area.

17:26.556 --> 17:29.023
All wounded soldiers
pass through here

17:29.025 --> 17:30.424
on their way out of battle.

17:30.426 --> 17:34.095
This is your opportunity
to hold your heads high

17:34.097 --> 17:37.532
and make the proper exit
you were previously denied.

17:37.534 --> 17:40.435
[Applause]

17:51.280 --> 17:53.548
You're up, warrior.

18:00.423 --> 18:01.957
Downey!

18:01.959 --> 18:03.159
I got this, Major.

18:03.161 --> 18:06.228
Mary.

18:10.133 --> 18:14.136
[Applause continues]

18:20.177 --> 18:23.246
Pete, you okay?

18:23.248 --> 18:26.449
This was, uh,
my wife's idea.

18:26.451 --> 18:28.318
Said she saw something
about it on TV

18:28.320 --> 18:29.986
and thought
it'd be good for me.

18:29.988 --> 18:31.855
Well, clearly she cares
about you.

18:31.857 --> 18:33.457
Well, she's had
divorce papers drawn up

18:33.459 --> 18:35.993
and ready to be signed
for over a year now.

18:35.995 --> 18:37.527
Says that I'm not
the same man she married.

18:37.529 --> 18:38.995
No shit.

18:38.997 --> 18:40.831
If she hasn't signed them,
she must still have hope.

18:40.833 --> 18:43.934
They gave this to me
two years after I got back.

18:43.936 --> 18:46.369
Said they changed
the eligibility requirements,

18:46.371 --> 18:49.373
so now concussions are
now worthy of a Purple Heart.

18:49.375 --> 18:50.941
Well...

18:50.943 --> 18:52.809
the problem is
my lieutenant died

18:52.811 --> 18:53.944
that day in Fallujah,

18:53.946 --> 18:56.713
trying to drag me
off the battlefield.

18:56.715 --> 18:58.682
I bumped my head,
and I get a medal.

18:58.684 --> 19:00.684
I don't deserve to wear it.

19:00.686 --> 19:02.853
You know who else feels
that kind of guilt?

19:02.855 --> 19:04.188
Me...

19:04.190 --> 19:07.024
and every other guy
that's gotten that damn thing

19:07.026 --> 19:10.194
since the military
schemed it up in 1782.

19:10.196 --> 19:12.030
That Purple Heart

19:12.032 --> 19:14.966
means you are both
very lucky

19:14.968 --> 19:18.169
and very unlucky.

19:18.171 --> 19:19.570
It's a hell of a club.

19:19.572 --> 19:22.039
Hey, battle trauma
is real, Pete.

19:22.041 --> 19:23.741
And because you earned that,

19:23.743 --> 19:26.544
you don't have to worry
about what anybody else thinks.

19:26.546 --> 19:28.380
You don't even have to wear it.

19:28.382 --> 19:31.550
It's just a thing.

19:31.552 --> 19:34.253
Well, who anointed you
my personal pope, hmm?

19:34.255 --> 19:36.589
'Cause I don't need your
permission to feel anything.

19:36.591 --> 19:38.757
And I don't need someone
on my wing trying to fix me.

19:38.759 --> 19:39.925
Hey, I'm not trying
to fix you.

19:39.927 --> 19:41.427
Bullshit!

19:41.429 --> 19:44.063
I mean, what, is this whole
Captain America 2.0 routine,

19:44.065 --> 19:46.165
this blind but battle-tested
yet better than ever,

19:46.167 --> 19:49.402
is this supposed
to inspire me?

19:49.404 --> 19:50.903
Hmm?

19:50.905 --> 19:54.907
Two words, sir...

19:54.909 --> 19:59.045
epic fail.

20:04.918 --> 20:06.619
[Entrance bell chimes]

20:06.621 --> 20:08.922
Eyal.

20:08.924 --> 20:10.457
Noah.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.258
It's been a long time.

20:12.260 --> 20:14.627
Not long enough.

20:16.931 --> 20:18.631
Yeah, well, it's
a time-sensitive mission,

20:18.633 --> 20:20.466
and I need your assistance.

20:20.468 --> 20:21.801
All right, how much?

20:21.803 --> 20:23.636
A hundred thousand
in clean diamonds.

20:23.638 --> 20:24.938
Steep.

20:24.940 --> 20:26.572
Okay, let me talk to Rivka,
get her approval.

20:26.574 --> 20:29.242
It's even too time-sensitive
for that.

20:29.244 --> 20:30.543
You taught me the protocols.

20:30.545 --> 20:33.146
You know I cannot give you that
without authorization.

20:33.148 --> 20:35.081
What are you doing?
You're a <i>sayan.</i>

20:35.083 --> 20:37.817
You're an assistant to Israel.
I need your assistance.

20:37.819 --> 20:39.819
It doesn't work this way.
You know that.

20:39.821 --> 20:42.756
I will tell you
how it works.

20:44.759 --> 20:46.460
Okay...

20:46.462 --> 20:49.263
get out of my shop now.
Go. Go now.

20:49.265 --> 20:50.631
- Really?
- Yes, really.

20:50.633 --> 20:52.633
[Screams, cries]

20:52.635 --> 20:54.969
Don't make me ask you again.

20:54.971 --> 20:56.470
That's enough.

21:02.477 --> 21:04.646
So much for laying low.

21:04.648 --> 21:06.147
What happened?

21:06.149 --> 21:07.749
I didn't have time
to be polite.

21:07.751 --> 21:08.816
We need to get that money

21:08.818 --> 21:10.985
so we can pay off
the club manager.

21:10.987 --> 21:12.820
I'm not talking
about your methods.

21:12.822 --> 21:14.655
You didn't want him
to call Tel Aviv.

21:14.657 --> 21:16.157
Are you on the outs
with Rivka?

21:16.159 --> 21:17.992
Did you get suspended?

21:17.994 --> 21:19.327
I quit Mossad.

21:19.329 --> 21:21.829
You quit Mossad?

21:21.831 --> 21:23.664
[Sighs]
I knew it.

21:23.666 --> 21:26.000
I knew they would make you take
the fall for them.

21:26.002 --> 21:27.468
Don't read too much into it.

21:27.470 --> 21:29.471
I wanted to hunt Khalid down
and kill him.

21:29.473 --> 21:31.172
And they already completed
their mission.

21:31.174 --> 21:32.674
Just call it
creative differences.

21:32.676 --> 21:34.175
- Eyal.
- It was time anyway.

21:34.177 --> 21:36.645
Eyal.

21:36.647 --> 21:39.047
I'm sorry.

21:39.049 --> 21:41.383
I can't imagine how hard
that must have been for you.

21:41.385 --> 21:43.351
I don't need your compassion
right now, Annie.

21:43.353 --> 21:44.519
What I need is money.

21:44.521 --> 21:46.221
Where are we gonna get
100,000 euro?

21:46.223 --> 21:47.856
I'm not even supposed
to be here.

21:47.858 --> 21:49.057
I don't know.

21:49.059 --> 21:51.626
But if we don't get our eyes
on that pass,

21:51.628 --> 21:54.696
we may never get to Khalid.

22:02.151 --> 22:06.288
[Line rings]

22:06.290 --> 22:07.522
- Hello?
- Joan.

22:07.524 --> 22:09.224
- Annie?
- I'm in Zurich...

22:09.226 --> 22:10.692
With Eyal.

22:10.694 --> 22:12.394
I need a favor.

22:12.396 --> 22:14.396
What is it?

22:14.398 --> 22:18.500
I need 100,000 Euros
in cash by noon my time.

22:18.502 --> 22:20.202
That's less
than an hour from now.

22:20.204 --> 22:21.637
I know it's a lot to ask,

22:21.639 --> 22:23.573
but I didn't know who else
to call.

22:23.575 --> 22:26.209
[Sighs] You want to tell me
what the money's for?

22:26.211 --> 22:27.511
Surveillance access.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.814
You're gonna need
to give me more than that.

22:29.816 --> 22:31.515
Read me in, Annie.

22:34.653 --> 22:36.721
Megan Carr was reported dead

22:36.723 --> 22:38.890
with a flash drive found
in her possession.

22:38.892 --> 22:41.559
I got on the first plane
to Luxembourg to investigate.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.528
Hey, Midge?

22:43.530 --> 22:44.996
Yes?

22:44.998 --> 22:48.233
Where's the DNA analysis
from the al-Masri drone strike?

22:48.235 --> 22:49.668
Well, that's it
on your desk, sir.

22:49.670 --> 22:51.904
- This is just the top sheet.
- That's all they sent.

22:51.906 --> 22:53.338
Well, call forensics
and tell them

22:53.340 --> 22:54.907
I want every ounce of data
from that site.

22:54.909 --> 22:57.576
I don't care how raw
or seemingly meaningless it is.

22:57.578 --> 23:00.846
Sir, we just got a call
from the Hill.

23:00.848 --> 23:04.850
