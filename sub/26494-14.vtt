WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:03.169
I can feel him in my head.

00:03.170 --> 00:05.004
Michael gets out,
that's it for this world.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.839
Billie. She said that
there's only one way

00:06.840 --> 00:08.216
that this ends right.

00:08.217 --> 00:10.343
Ma'lak box. Secured and warded.

00:10.344 --> 00:13.471
Once inside, nothing gets out,
not even an archangel.

00:13.472 --> 00:16.015
Plan is, charter a boat to
take me out to the Pacific.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.600
- Splash.
- You and Michael,

00:17.601 --> 00:19.686
trapped together...
For eternity?

00:26.693 --> 00:28.778
When Jack's grace
was taken from him,

00:28.779 --> 00:30.696
his being fell into chaos.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.157
The cells are gobbling
each other up.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.158
He's gone.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.619
My magic draws power
from the soul.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.496
It could save him.
How much of it?

00:38.497 --> 00:40.122
As long as he's only using it

00:40.123 --> 00:43.167
to sustain his body,
it won't cost much.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.503
He'll never miss it.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.050
We're the guys
who save that world.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.302
Sam, I have tried everything.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.265
- I believe in us.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:57.557 --> 01:00.518
Why don't you
believe in us, too?

01:00.519 --> 01:03.145
Okay, Sam.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.397
Maybe Billie's wrong.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.856
But I do believe in us.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.483
And I'll keep believing
until I can't.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.901
But when that day comes...

01:08.902 --> 01:12.072
If that day comes...

01:12.864 --> 01:16.200
Sam, you have to take it
for what it is...

01:16.201 --> 01:17.576
The end.

01:17.577 --> 01:20.914
All right. All right.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.905
Now, we keep getting
interrupted, don't we, Felix?

02:35.906 --> 02:37.740
So let's just make sure
we have enough time

02:37.741 --> 02:40.452
for a proper supper tonight,
shall we?

02:58.261 --> 03:01.472
They're on their way again,
Felix.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.350
Time to go.

03:04.726 --> 03:08.230
A snack for later.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.403
No.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.798
He's cooking the body parts...

04:17.798 --> 04:21.343
again.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.345
I got nothing.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.264
Aw, come on.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.808
Seriously? How does this
keep happening?

04:27.809 --> 04:29.894
I thought we had him this time.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.104
Look at this. He's all cut up.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.023
No restraints, like last time.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.524
And he was killed recently.

04:35.525 --> 04:38.027
I suspect he was very much alive
when the cutting started.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.361
I don't understand.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.071
Why don't any of them
fight back?

04:41.072 --> 04:42.740
Yeah. Who would just let
themselves be eaten?

04:42.741 --> 04:45.034
Hey, I'll say it again.
My money's on witchcraft.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.368
Och, you.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.037
Always blaming witches.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.456
'Cause a lot of times
it's witches.

04:50.457 --> 04:54.336
Rowena, your tracking spell was
supposed to make this easier.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.339
There I was, in the middle
of a glorious

04:58.340 --> 05:00.549
rosewater and vanilla-oil
massage,

05:00.550 --> 05:03.302
hidden away at an exclusive
desert spa,

05:03.303 --> 05:06.722
when you called me,
begging for my help.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.642
Well, because we've been chasing
this guy for weeks.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.643
What's your point?

05:10.644 --> 05:12.478
My point, Dean,

05:12.479 --> 05:15.397
is that you asked for my
assistance, and I obliged.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.941
And while the killer eluded us,

05:16.942 --> 05:18.734
it certainly looks as if
he was here quite recently.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.277
I'd call that a success.

05:20.278 --> 05:23.281
Yeah, that's a success. Sam.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.993
Hello, Castiel.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.163
Okay, looks like
our dinner guest here,

05:31.164 --> 05:32.498
his name is Dennis Barron.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.584
He's 43, and this is his house.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.962
No signs of forced entry
and no restraints.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.463
- It's all the same.
- Yep.

05:39.464 --> 05:43.926
Well, not... everything.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.386
Maybe it's his pet.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.680
I mean, no pictures
in his phone.

05:47.681 --> 05:51.475
And, this place doesn't
exactly scream "snake guy."

05:51.476 --> 05:54.604
Not enough Pantera posters,
for one.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.652
There was some pepper
on something.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.946
I don't know. I'm fine.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.115
I'm not dying.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.784
Okay, so, what?
This guy's some real Houdini?

06:08.785 --> 06:11.579
Well, however he's avoiding us,
he's now claimed the lives

06:11.580 --> 06:15.124
of at least six people
in northern New Mexico.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.584
That we know about.

06:16.585 --> 06:19.336
Aye, but this is the first one
I've seen in the flesh.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.547
Did they all have these
blackened lips?

06:21.548 --> 06:24.383
Yeah, or just
black patches of skin

06:24.384 --> 06:25.801
around their face and neck.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.177
Yeah, but we've been
more focused on

06:27.178 --> 06:30.515
the "missing eyeballs
and cannibalism" angle.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.310
Do the black lips
mean something?

06:34.311 --> 06:38.147
Darling boy,
everything means something.

06:38.148 --> 06:41.443
Be a dear and bring
the snakeskin.

06:54.539 --> 06:59.461
You know, the last time I saw
Jack, he was on death's door.

07:02.088 --> 07:05.132
You say, " it's just some magic,"

07:05.133 --> 07:07.843
and you think
I'll leave it at that?

07:07.844 --> 07:10.179
Okay, listen.

07:10.180 --> 07:13.140
Jack is all right.
You don't need to worry.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.518
I wouldn't say worried.
More curious.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.605
Speaking of which,
I'm also curious

07:19.606 --> 07:22.816
as to how your brother is
managing to keep an archangel

07:22.817 --> 07:24.943
locked away inside his mind.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.613
Because... he's Dean.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.156
And Dean is Dean.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.616
He's fine.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.619
For how long?

07:33.995 --> 07:36.330
We're working on it,
Rowena, another way to...

07:36.331 --> 07:38.707
To keep Michael locked up
or... or kill him...

07:38.708 --> 07:41.543
But? But, for now,
staying busy is good.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.338
For all of us.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.965
Okay.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.301
You know, I got to say, I got
a pretty good feeling

07:49.302 --> 07:50.678
about bringing Rowena in
on this one.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.971
I think her and Sam have
a chance of cracking it.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.516
They do have many books.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.602
Yes, they do.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.738
Hey, Dean?

08:09.739 --> 08:10.864
I'm fine.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.700
What you're doing,
even just sitting here

08:12.701 --> 08:14.743
and having a cup of coffee,
is a Herculean feat.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.495
I can't imagine the willpower

08:16.496 --> 08:20.458
it's taking to...
keep Michael imprisoned.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.952
Are you really fine?

08:56.953 --> 08:59.539
I don't know, Cass.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.292
But that's what I'm
supposed to say, right?

09:03.293 --> 09:05.252
"I'm fine," keep on moving?

09:05.253 --> 09:06.795
That's what we all say.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.757
No, Dean.

09:09.841 --> 09:13.135
Okay.

09:13.136 --> 09:17.931
There's this pounding
in my head.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.060
It never stops.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.562
Michael's in there,

09:23.563 --> 09:26.316
and he is fighting hard
to get out.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.905
And I can't let my guard down...

09:32.906 --> 09:35.324
not for a second.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.368
I'm barely even sleeping.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.537
Well, that's not sustainable.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.539
No. No. It's probably not.

09:42.540 --> 09:46.752
But... no point in
complaining about it.

09:46.753 --> 09:47.795
It's on me.

09:47.796 --> 09:50.798
No. It's on us.

09:50.799 --> 09:53.133
We are here to help you.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.927
I know. I know that.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.845
And I appreciate that.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.890
I do.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.578
Look, before the kid
gets back...

10:21.579 --> 10:23.705
I know I agreed
to give you guys time.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.708
Hey, Dean, and we will
find a solution.

10:26.709 --> 10:32.506
Okay. But if... if you don't...

10:32.507 --> 10:33.882
we still have Plan B.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.717
Dean, come on.

10:35.718 --> 10:40.430
Coffin. Ocean. Done.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.724
Here's an order for 18.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.818
Are you all right?

10:52.819 --> 10:54.319
I'm fine.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.573
Hey, see? Look at that.
Everybody's fine.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.075
- What?
- Nothing.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.416
Okay, um...

11:07.417 --> 11:09.126
these killings...

11:09.127 --> 11:12.713
It seems like there's
a ritualistic quality

11:12.714 --> 11:15.258
to the crime scenes, right?
It's almost liturgical.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.472
It means religious.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.683
Yeah. See, that one I knew.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.226
Maybe we're wrong and...

11:26.227 --> 11:27.936
And this isn't a monster at all.

11:27.937 --> 11:32.274
Maybe this is just a deranged
person who's been getting lucky.

11:32.275 --> 11:35.235
Anyone who could do this
is a monster...

11:35.236 --> 11:37.863
I mean, even if they're human.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.449
Kid's not wrong.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.912
Yeah.

11:45.204 --> 11:47.539
Okay. Got it.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.876
Looks like Sam and Rowena
have something.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.837
Okay, so, we've made
some progress.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.048
This is like an A.V. Club
presentation.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.799
What's an A.V. Club?

11:57.800 --> 12:01.386
It's a special group for people
who do not play sports.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.013
Yeah, him. He's A.V. Club.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.933
Excuse me, boys, but this is
a bit more pressing

12:05.934 --> 12:07.643
than your hilarious banter.

12:07.644 --> 12:12.981
I believe we are
hunting a gorgon,

12:12.982 --> 12:16.360
an ancient, cursed being
with an affinity for snakes

12:16.361 --> 12:18.487
and a hunger for human flesh.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.864
Snakes for hair?
That's like Medusa.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.658
You know about Medusa?

12:22.659 --> 12:24.201
Yeah.

12:24.202 --> 12:26.955
"Clash of the Titans"?
Turns guys to stone?

12:28.873 --> 12:32.376
That's the exaggerated
version. It's not stone.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.086
More of a venom-induced
paralysis.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.671
Hence, the blackened lips.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.631
And the fact that the victims
didn't fight back.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.384
And the snakeskin, which,
frankly, was a bit on the nose.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.593
Yeah.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.804
So we expanded our search
based on this new information,

12:43.805 --> 12:47.432
and we found 17 unexplained
deaths that could fit our guy,

12:47.433 --> 12:50.728
last three months, moving west
across the southern U.S.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.523
- 17 people.
- Yeah.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.650
Legend has it, every few months,

12:56.651 --> 12:59.444
the gorgon goes on a spree
and gorges itself.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.697
Like a snake. That makes sense.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.448
So, is there anything in there

13:03.449 --> 13:05.994
that explains why this gorgon
keeps eluding us?

13:07.787 --> 13:11.665
Some lore says that a gorgon
can tell people's fates,

13:11.666 --> 13:14.501
and, by consuming human eyes,

13:14.502 --> 13:17.504
they may "glimpse the future."

13:17.505 --> 13:20.966
Yeah. We think that's how
he sees us coming.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.343
So, then even if we use
your tracking spell again,

13:23.344 --> 13:25.095
he'll know.

13:25.096 --> 13:27.806
So... how do we get him?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.976
I don't know.

13:37.358 --> 13:40.569
Need something, fella?

13:40.570 --> 13:42.946
I really need a ride.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.281
Not a taxi.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.366
And some food.
I'm kind of starving.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.744
I'm not a cook, either.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.038
Really appreciate any help.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.957
And I'd find a way
to pay you back.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.417
Yeah?

13:55.418 --> 13:57.044
Definitely.

13:57.045 --> 13:59.004
Anything you want.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.590
And I've always had
a sense about people.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.717
And I can tell that you...

14:03.718 --> 14:06.929
definitely... want things.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.184
Get in. We'll work it out.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.526
So...

14:21.527 --> 14:25.865
you ready to do... anything?

14:38.878 --> 14:41.379
You're gonna have
to do better than that if...

14:41.380 --> 14:43.465
I'm so glad we got in the truck.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.384
So much easier this way,
isn't it?

14:46.385 --> 14:48.804
Right now, my poison...
It's paralyzing you.

14:48.805 --> 14:53.100
But, sadly, the numbing takes
a little while to kick in.

14:53.101 --> 14:57.271
So, you're gonna feel this.

15:26.467 --> 15:29.719
- Agents Page and Jones, FBI.
- Why is the FBI...

15:29.720 --> 15:31.888
We had a few more of these
across state lines.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.223
Anything unusual?

15:33.224 --> 15:35.350
Other than the guy
missing his eyes?

15:35.351 --> 15:37.310
Is this amusing to you?

15:37.311 --> 15:40.147
N-no, sir.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.691
Sorry. I...

15:42.692 --> 15:44.317
I'm just a little freaked out.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.153
I've never seen
anything like this.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.487
And...

15:47.488 --> 15:49.948
Yes, there is one other thing...

15:49.949 --> 15:51.324
A note on the body.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.909
A note?

15:52.910 --> 15:54.077
Yeah.

15:54.078 --> 15:57.080
It's made out
to some guy named Dean.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.876
Can I see that?

16:02.170 --> 16:03.962
Thank you.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.089
Excuse me.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.924
What does it say?

16:07.925 --> 16:11.888
"Dean, I see you standing alone
by the truck reading this note."

16:13.931 --> 16:17.225
"I see you and the tall man and
the red-headed witch chasing me."

16:17.226 --> 16:19.561
I will always see you.

16:19.562 --> 16:23.607
"Stop, or I will make you stop.
Regards, Noah."

16:23.608 --> 16:27.027
I'm on a first-name basis
with some psycho pen pal.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.320
That's aces.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.988
Somehow he knows you.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.867
But you're not standing alone.
Why doesn't he mention me?

16:34.118 --> 16:35.828
Maybe you're not his type.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.581
So, Noah can see
you, me, and Rowena.

16:39.582 --> 16:40.999
For the record, I don't love

16:41.000 --> 16:43.210
being included
on his little hit list.

16:43.211 --> 16:44.961
But can't see Cass and Jack?

16:44.962 --> 16:47.797
It's an odd and glaring
omission.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.174
No.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.468
It's our shot.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.094
I mean, this guy...

16:53.095 --> 16:55.096
For some reason,
he... he can't see angels.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.224
I'm not an angel.

16:57.225 --> 16:58.975
Well, apparently
you're close enough.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.394
So, if Jack and I approach
Noah on our own,

17:01.395 --> 17:03.688
we... we may surprise him.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.358
Yeah. I-It's risky.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.526
But I-I think
it's probably our best play.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.364
Rowena, get your
tracking spell ready.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.492
Okay.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.327
- Everything you need?
- Aye, but I should mix up

17:17.328 --> 17:19.204
an antidote
to the gorgon's poison

17:19.204 --> 17:21.164
in case one of you boys
gets sloppy.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.333
I'll just need a wee bit
of antivenom.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.085
Antivenom is
a controlled substance.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.461
How do you... Don't worry.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.798
I have a plan.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.845
Help! Please help us!

17:35.846 --> 17:37.806
It's our wee doggie...
He's so sick!

17:37.807 --> 17:39.641
He's not responding.
He's lethargic.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.810
We... We think he might have
eaten something.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.895
"We think"? "We think"?
He means that

17:43.896 --> 17:46.231
it's my fault for not keeping
an eye on the poor dear.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.941
He thinks that everything
is my fault.

17:47.942 --> 17:49.484
Can we not fight
in front of the vet?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.027
I mean, I guess it's not

17:51.028 --> 17:52.237
entirely your fault
that you looked away!

17:52.238 --> 17:53.905
He blames me for everything!

17:53.906 --> 17:56.908
I let his mother ride
the Jet Ski one time!

17:56.909 --> 17:58.994
Here, I'll just...
Let me take him.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.205
Yeah. Great. Thanks.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.165
What's his name?

18:04.166 --> 18:05.500
Jack.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.586
Jack. Wee Jackie boy.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.046
His breathing's okay.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.007
Let me set him down in the back,
check his vitals.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.425
Thank you. Thank you so much.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.886
Please help him..

18:18.681 --> 18:20.348
What are you doing?

18:20.349 --> 18:21.933
I mean, I realize it's not...

18:21.934 --> 18:23.810
pretending to be the FBI.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.604
But there are other ways

18:25.605 --> 18:27.856
of doing things, Samuel.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.399
Plus...

18:29.400 --> 18:34.113
I thought my performance
was quite magnificent.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.657
Well, that was easy, wasn't it?

18:37.658 --> 18:40.785
You're the sweetest boy,
aren't you?

18:40.786 --> 18:44.748
I'm going to have Mommy
and Daddy fill out some forms.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.293
You wait right there.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.731
Well, he seems okay, but we're
gonna do some blood work

19:09.732 --> 19:11.025
just to...

19:32.671 --> 19:36.717
Jack?! Jack?!

19:43.516 --> 19:46.851
- This will work perfectly.
- Great.

19:46.852 --> 19:50.189
Just wish I could've got it
before she took my temperature.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.404
Right. All right. Let's get.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.906
A moment, Samuel.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.493
What?

20:03.327 --> 20:05.453
What did you do to that boy?

20:05.454 --> 20:07.580
When I cast
the transformation spell,

20:07.581 --> 20:09.582
I felt something
else pushing back,

20:09.583 --> 20:11.501
some other thing inside him.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.753
It's volatile magic, powerful,

20:13.754 --> 20:17.590
and it's stitched to him
like some kind of parasite.

20:17.591 --> 20:18.967
I was curious before,

20:18.968 --> 20:22.679
but now I am worried,
so I'll ask you again, Sam.

20:22.680 --> 20:23.972
What did you do?

20:23.973 --> 20:25.932
Okay, listen.
Jack's being careful.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.143
We're all being careful.
That's all you need to know.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.103
Fine. Don't tell me.

20:30.104 --> 20:33.731
But using dangerous, mysterious
magic, regardless of the cost,

20:33.732 --> 20:36.192
that's a very on-brand
me thing to do.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.944
Well, thank you.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.863
Of course, Samuel.

20:39.864 --> 20:43.033
Until very recently,
I was the villain.

20:59.717 --> 21:02.635
He's being good and quiet,
isn't he, Felix?

21:02.636 --> 21:05.805
Because we made a deal,
didn't we?

21:05.806 --> 21:11.060
He stays quiet,
no talking, no screaming,

21:11.061 --> 21:14.482
and he doesn't have to die
like all those other men.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.986
Do you think he has
any vegetable oil?

21:20.404 --> 21:24.073
'Cause Felix can't actually
talk, so you should respond.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.993
It's in the cupboard...

21:26.994 --> 21:28.328
by the oven.

21:28.329 --> 21:31.998
That's perfect.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.667
Honestly, it's not like
I enjoy eating people.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.086
It's a lonely way to live,

21:37.087 --> 21:39.798
and there's only so many ways
you can cook human.

21:40.925 --> 21:45.136
But sometimes fate
is cruel and boring.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.387
Am I right?

21:46.388 --> 21:48.723
You're not...
You're not serious.

21:48.724 --> 21:51.017
Maybe you just have
a concussion.

21:51.018 --> 21:55.063
Maybe this is all
a hallucination?

21:55.064 --> 21:58.441
Ha! "Serious"?

21:58.442 --> 22:02.111
Ask the men of New Mexico
if I'm serious.

22:02.112 --> 22:05.198
That's a pretty biased sample
at this point, really.

22:05.199 --> 22:07.033
The men of...

22:07.034 --> 22:10.371
You're just preying on...
On helpless men?

22:11.747 --> 22:13.873
"Helpless men"... that's rich.

22:13.874 --> 22:16.626
No, I do eat ladies, too,

22:16.627 --> 22:18.711
but women have become
so cautious lately.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.463
Must be all that
finally waking up

22:20.464 --> 22:22.590
from centuries of
misogynistic oppression.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.427
Good for them. Bad for you.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.974
It's so bad for him,
isn't it, Felix?

22:30.975 --> 22:34.185
No! Help! Help! Someone!

22:34.186 --> 22:37.230
Unh-unh-unh! You know the rules.

22:37.231 --> 22:38.773
Help me!

22:38.774 --> 22:42.360
Screaming's a deal breaker.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.238
I...

22:48.033 --> 22:50.368
Now let's go figure out
how to work that oven,

22:50.369 --> 22:52.454
shall we, Felix?

23:03.799 --> 23:05.633
- Do you have it?
- According to the lore,

23:05.634 --> 23:07.135
the only way to kill a gorgon

23:07.136 --> 23:09.637
is by cutting off its head
with a silver blade.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.097
Great.

23:11.098 --> 23:13.016
Why couldn't it just
be bullets, right?

23:13.017 --> 23:14.267
Yeah.

23:14.268 --> 23:16.270
What about over there?
Everything okay?

23:19.315 --> 23:21.232
It's quiet. We're good.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.692
And Mary checked in.

23:22.693 --> 23:24.152
She finished up
that case in Oregon.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.653
She's starting
her drive back tonight.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.114
Great. Maggie, hey,
I really appreciate

23:28.115 --> 23:30.491
you stepping up and handling
things while we're gone.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.119
- Be safe.
- You bet.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.330
All right.

23:35.331 --> 23:39.042
- Everybody ready?
- Yes.

23:39.043 --> 23:42.003
He's less than an hour
west of us and not moving.

23:42.004 --> 23:44.297
All right, well,
break out the silver blades.

23:44.298 --> 23:45.923
Maggie says decapitation

23:45.924 --> 23:47.467
is the only way
to kill these things.

23:47.468 --> 23:48.885
But if we cut off their head,

23:48.886 --> 23:50.720
then is more creatures
gonna crawl out?

23:50.721 --> 23:52.972
Wait. Other creatures?

23:52.973 --> 23:55.141
H-He's talking about
"Clash of the Titans" again.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.726
We don't know.

23:56.727 --> 24:00.522
A few drops of this concoction
should counteract any poison.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.149
Theoretically.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.068
"Theoretically."
That's comforting.

24:05.069 --> 24:08.529
Yeah, well, assuming you're not
all paralyzed or eaten...

24:08.530 --> 24:10.324
off with his head.

24:19.708 --> 24:23.253
I'm not expecting anyone.
Are you?

24:34.348 --> 24:35.598
No fair.

24:35.599 --> 24:37.266
You're not human.

24:37.267 --> 24:40.269
And you're a monster.
Demi-god, technically.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.730
You stay where you are. Hey.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.941
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

24:44.942 --> 24:46.902
Jack, watch him.

24:48.112 --> 24:51.406
I didn't see you coming,
but I see you now.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.950
Shut up.

24:53.951 --> 24:56.285
Have you ever heard the story
of the black snake?

24:56.286 --> 24:58.413
Hey! Hands up.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.748
Once there was
a crafty black snake

25:00.749 --> 25:02.875
who kept eating this
poor chicken's eggs.

25:02.876 --> 25:05.378
She couldn't watch them
all the time, you see?

25:05.379 --> 25:07.797
The black snake would wait
until she was gone...

25:07.798 --> 25:09.924
and then slide one of
the eggs into his mouth

25:09.925 --> 25:11.342
and crush it in his throat.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.804
Now, this went on until
there was only one egg left.

25:14.805 --> 25:17.014
But when the chicken
left that egg,

25:17.015 --> 25:19.475
just for a moment,
the snake swallowed it up.

25:19.476 --> 25:22.937
But for some reason, he couldn't
crush it in his throat.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.606
The chicken had hard-boiled
her final egg

25:25.607 --> 25:28.234
just to choke the snake.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.069
And the snake died.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.989
Why are you telling this story?

25:32.990 --> 25:34.949
Because I can't quite tell

25:34.950 --> 25:38.620
if he's the chicken...
or the snake.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.332
We're done here.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.307
Cass!

26:08.150 --> 26:09.400
Hello, Dean.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.653
Wish I could say it's nice
to meet you in person.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.450
Yeah. It's a real pleasure.

26:28.545 --> 26:29.755
Dean!

26:45.187 --> 26:46.646
Dean!

26:46.647 --> 26:48.232
Ready?

27:09.461 --> 27:11.379
Check on Cass.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.340
I got Dean.

27:14.508 --> 27:17.343
Cass, can you breathe?

27:17.344 --> 27:20.680
Hey, hey, hey.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.850
Dean?

27:35.529 --> 27:37.196
It's not working.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.906
Why isn't it working?!

27:38.907 --> 27:40.492
Cass?

27:52.546 --> 27:54.422
Jack, what are you doing?

27:54.423 --> 27:56.091
You're okay.

27:58.176 --> 28:01.220
Wake up! Hey! Dean?

28:01.221 --> 28:02.514
Guys!

28:04.558 --> 28:07.519
Hey. Wake up. Dean.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.074
W-Why won't he wake up? Is he...

28:22.075 --> 28:24.702
- It's a head injury.
- I'll get ice.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.413
Cass, do it.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.462
Well?

28:34.463 --> 28:35.922
I still can't heal him.

28:35.923 --> 28:38.508
I can't even see what's
going on inside his head.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.762
I can help.

28:42.763 --> 28:45.222
No. Jack.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.266
I appreciate what
you did for me,

28:47.267 --> 28:49.978
but you cannot afford to burn
off any more of your soul.

28:59.279 --> 29:01.280
So that's what
you have him doing?

29:01.281 --> 29:04.951
We'll talk about it later,
Rowena. Now is not a good time.

29:04.952 --> 29:07.662
Maybe the gorgon did something
to Dean before he...

29:07.663 --> 29:09.456
Smashed his face into the wall?

29:18.507 --> 29:21.217
What do I do?

29:21.218 --> 29:24.179
Clean his wound.
Make him comfortable, then...

29:25.597 --> 29:27.724
we'll see.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.573
Hey! Hey!

29:47.160 --> 29:48.911
It's okay. It's okay.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.372
It's okay.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.530
Jack.

30:26.575 --> 30:29.077
I hate seeing him like that.

30:30.579 --> 30:34.206
But he's gonna be okay, right?

30:34.207 --> 30:37.960
I mean, it's Dean.

30:37.961 --> 30:40.629
He...

30:40.630 --> 30:41.839
It was a fight.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.674
It was... It was just a fight.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.677
Every time we go out,
there's always a risk.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.679
I-I can't...

30:48.680 --> 30:52.224
think about losing him

30:52.225 --> 30:54.227
or... or Sam or you.

30:55.729 --> 30:58.564
I-I just... I hate...
I hate thinking about it.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.609
Yeah. So do I.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.570
But, Jack...

31:04.571 --> 31:07.573
you know, Sam and Dean,
they're human,

31:07.574 --> 31:11.285
and they're very extraordinary,

31:11.286 --> 31:12.661
brave, special humans,

31:12.662 --> 31:14.663
but they're...
They're still humans.

31:14.664 --> 31:18.417
And humans burn bright,
but for a very brief time

31:18.418 --> 31:22.254
compared to, you know,
things like us.

31:22.255 --> 31:26.383
And eventually, they're gone,
even the very best ones,

31:26.384 --> 31:29.428
and we have to carry on.

31:29.429 --> 31:31.138
It's just...

31:31.139 --> 31:32.723
It's part of growing up.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.268
Losing people?

31:37.270 --> 31:38.313
Yes.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.398
What's the point?

31:41.399 --> 31:42.775
The point?

31:42.776 --> 31:44.944
What's the point of
being a cosmic being

31:44.945 --> 31:49.949
if everyone I care about
is just gonna... leave?

31:49.950 --> 31:53.577
The point is that
they were here at all

31:53.578 --> 31:56.789
and you got to know them, you...

31:56.790 --> 31:59.708
When they're gone, it will hurt,

31:59.709 --> 32:04.214
but that hurt will remind you
of how much you loved them.

32:06.508 --> 32:08.510
That sounds...

32:11.680 --> 32:13.097
awful.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.558
It is. But it's also living.

32:15.559 --> 32:18.853
So when Dean wakes up...
And he will wake up...

32:18.854 --> 32:20.813
We just have to
remember to appreciate

32:20.814 --> 32:23.483
the time that we all have
together now.

32:29.531 --> 32:31.783
What if he doesn't wake up?

32:33.034 --> 32:34.535
What about Michael? What if...

32:34.536 --> 32:35.786
I don't know, Jack.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.496
Okay, but I could use my powers.

32:37.497 --> 32:40.583
No, Jack, I know you want
to help, but you cannot...

32:40.584 --> 32:42.543
What is the good of
having these powers

32:42.544 --> 32:44.253
if I can't help
the people that I love,

32:44.254 --> 32:46.130
if I can't help them
when they need it?

32:46.131 --> 32:47.798
Jack...
It's selfish of me not to.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.550
I understand how
frustrating it is.

32:49.551 --> 32:50.719
I know.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.477
You're keeping the snake?

33:00.478 --> 33:02.479
Yeah.

33:02.480 --> 33:07.402
Rowena said that the gorgons
can see people's fate.

33:08.486 --> 33:12.115
And Noah said he could see me.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.660
That... That story.

33:16.661 --> 33:19.622
The story about the chicken
and the snake?

33:19.623 --> 33:20.623
It was just...

33:20.624 --> 33:22.209
He was stalling.

33:25.212 --> 33:26.587
What does it mean?

33:26.588 --> 33:30.550
Well, it's a story
about greed mostly.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.511
But I guess it's also...

33:34.512 --> 33:39.016
It's also about being willing
to give up the thing you love...

33:39.017 --> 33:41.228
in order to kill
the thing you hate.

33:43.980 --> 33:47.858
He said that he didn't know if
I was the chicken or the snake.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.569
Does that...

33:50.570 --> 33:52.906
Dean.

33:54.824 --> 33:57.243
Where is he?! Where is he?!

33:57.244 --> 33:58.661
No, wait! Dean! Dean!

33:58.662 --> 34:00.996
No! Stop! Dean, stop it!
It's... It's me!

34:00.997 --> 34:02.957
You're in the bunker!
I know where I am!

34:02.958 --> 34:05.668
That's not...

34:05.669 --> 34:07.629
Dean.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.885
He's gone.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.520
Michael. He's gone.

34:25.522 --> 34:26.563
How?

34:28.984 --> 34:30.900
This is my fault.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.070
I let my guard down.
This is my fault.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.406
- No, Dean...
- I told you!

34:35.407 --> 34:37.616
I told you to let me
take that coffin ride

34:37.617 --> 34:39.118
to the bottom of the ocean!

34:39.119 --> 34:40.870
Okay, Dean, j-just...

34:43.498 --> 34:45.623
Maggie?!

34:45.625 --> 34:48.253
Sam!

34:48.878 --> 34:52.047
Maggie!

35:04.477 --> 35:07.689
No. No.

35:10.817 --> 35:12.027
No.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.618
Hello, boys.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.295
I could've burned them all,

35:31.296 --> 35:34.506
but I'm feeling very hands-on.

35:34.507 --> 35:36.091
Michael.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.676
That's right.

35:37.677 --> 35:40.889
I thought you'd appreciate
this vessel.

35:42.849 --> 35:44.350
You let her go.

35:44.351 --> 35:46.018
Please.

35:46.019 --> 35:48.687
She's much sturdier
than she looks.

35:48.688 --> 35:51.774
Must be the hundreds
of years of magic.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.484
Rowena never
would have let you in.

35:53.485 --> 35:57.572
She didn't want
to say yes, but...

36:22.555 --> 36:25.266
Hello, Rowena.

36:26.810 --> 36:31.272
This is all in your mind.

36:32.232 --> 36:34.483
You're not Dean.

36:34.484 --> 36:37.319
I was... for a while.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.696
But it didn't work out.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.699
It was him, not me.

36:42.700 --> 36:45.494
And now I'm looking
for a new home.

36:45.495 --> 36:47.788
- A-And you think...
- If you say yes,

36:47.789 --> 36:50.624
I'll make you this promise...

36:50.625 --> 36:52.335
I'll leave you alive.

36:56.714 --> 36:59.883
I'll live either way.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.802
Excuse me?

37:01.803 --> 37:04.722
Fate says Sam Winchester's
going to off me,

37:04.723 --> 37:06.098
which makes dinners
a bit awkward,

37:06.099 --> 37:09.977
but does give one a certain
sense of... security.

37:09.978 --> 37:13.398
So whilst I'm flattered,
I think we can both do better.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.525
Fine.

37:16.526 --> 37:18.152
Then how about this...

37:18.153 --> 37:22.614
I'll leave you alive,
find another host,

37:22.615 --> 37:26.660
and then I'll kill every one of
the people in this bunker...

37:26.661 --> 37:30.873
everyone you care about.

37:30.874 --> 37:33.625
And you do care about them,

37:33.626 --> 37:35.753
no matter what you tell them,

37:35.754 --> 37:38.505
no matter what
you tell yourself.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.133
So...

37:41.134 --> 37:43.260
say yes.

37:43.261 --> 37:46.431
Choice is yours.

37:55.356 --> 37:59.651
I had no
intention of keeping my word,

37:59.652 --> 38:02.696
but I think she knew that.

38:02.697 --> 38:07.701
If only Dean had used that
coffin when he had the chance.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.995
Never too late for a good idea.

38:09.996 --> 38:11.498
Sam, get the cuffs.

38:15.752 --> 38:18.837
That's not very nice.

38:18.838 --> 38:21.590
And if we're not being nice,

38:21.591 --> 38:25.094
what if... you couldn't breathe?

38:28.014 --> 38:30.265
That's a terrible feeling,
isn't it?

38:30.266 --> 38:32.185
What if you were also blind?

38:33.645 --> 38:36.898
Sam.

38:38.733 --> 38:42.695
And what if you just hurt?

38:44.864 --> 38:48.700
But... fun as this is,

38:48.701 --> 38:51.830
I think... no more games.

38:53.873 --> 38:57.626
This time, you all die.

38:57.627 --> 39:00.755
This time, the world burns.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.591
Michael!

39:14.018 --> 39:15.727
Let them go.

39:15.728 --> 39:18.146
You think you can match me, boy?

39:18.147 --> 39:22.777
This power you have now...
It's nothing, just a crutch.

39:30.326 --> 39:32.328
How dare you!

39:33.705 --> 39:37.375
Burning off your soul?
You'll run out soon enough.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.878
It's worth the cost.

39:40.879 --> 39:44.298
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.509
I feel the same.

39:47.510 --> 39:50.387
I am the commander of the host!

39:50.388 --> 39:52.639
I am the cleanser of worlds!

39:52.640 --> 39:55.767
I will not be challenged
by a child!

39:55.768 --> 39:57.854
I'm not a child!

40:00.648 --> 40:02.566
I'm the son of Lucifer.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.109
I'm a Hunter.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.029
I am a Winchester!

40:08.364 --> 40:09.616
Jack! No!

40:19.876 --> 40:23.421
You won't hurt anyone
ever again!

40:52.158 --> 40:54.160
Jack?

40:58.498 --> 41:01.249
Michael.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.752
He's dead.

41:03.753 --> 41:05.963
Jack, a-are you, -

41:16.140 --> 41:18.643
I'm me again.
