No, please, please, please,
I'’m sorry, I'm sor...

25:56.555 --> 25:58.687
Sentimental value.

25:58.731 --> 26:01.385
But, uh, you'’re welcome
to keep the cash.

26:01.429 --> 26:03.431
Goodness knows
where you'’ve hidden that.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.304
[cries]

26:07.348 --> 26:09.568
I'’m so sorry; please
don'’t call the cops.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.352
It'’s just...

26:11.395 --> 26:13.180
my dad died
recently and...

26:13.223 --> 26:15.225
he used to own the
club I was singing at.

26:15.269 --> 26:16.792
You know, Fletcher'’s?Mm.

26:16.836 --> 26:19.099
But he owed this ginormous
amount of cash

26:19.142 --> 26:20.579
to this super scary loan shark,

26:20.622 --> 26:23.669
Louie Pagliani, and he used
the club as collateral,

26:23.712 --> 26:26.497
and if I don'’t come up
with 300 grand, like now,

26:26.541 --> 26:28.587
Louie'’s gonna take it.

26:28.630 --> 26:32.416
And who knows what else.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.941
[crying]:
I didn'’t know what else to do!

26:36.464 --> 26:39.902
Bravo, you really are
quite the performer, aren'’t you?

26:39.946 --> 26:42.470
[crying]:
You, you don'’t believe me?

26:42.513 --> 26:44.820
What, the weepy waterworks?
Not a chance.

26:45.952 --> 26:47.649
But your story
seems legit, though.

26:47.693 --> 26:51.261
[hyperventilating]

26:51.305 --> 26:52.436
[exhales]

26:52.480 --> 26:53.568
It is.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.788
And so is my apology.

26:55.831 --> 26:56.919
[laughs]

26:56.963 --> 26:59.008
I actually felt bad.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.444
From the looks of you
at the bar,

27:00.488 --> 27:02.751
you got your own problems
to deal with.

27:02.795 --> 27:04.013
Yeah.

27:04.057 --> 27:06.363
Nothing I can'’t handle
on my own.

27:06.407 --> 27:07.451
You sure about that?

27:12.631 --> 27:16.286
And so, you see, I...

27:16.330 --> 27:17.636
I had to leave.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.464
Hmm, I get it.

27:20.508 --> 27:21.944
The part about your dad

27:21.988 --> 27:24.686
putting the detective
in your path is kind of fuzzy,

27:24.730 --> 27:29.082
but it seems like
you genuinely care about her.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.431
Yes.

27:30.474 --> 27:31.780
I do.

27:31.824 --> 27:34.391
A lot.

27:34.435 --> 27:36.698
Then, isn'’t you going AWOL
gonna kind of throw a big...

27:36.742 --> 27:38.134
flag on that play?

27:38.178 --> 27:40.615
No, I said that
Icare about her.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.486
Oh, unrequited love.

27:42.530 --> 27:43.966
Yeah, I get that, too.

27:44.010 --> 27:45.968
No, no, no, it'’s
not unrequited.

27:46.012 --> 27:48.841
It'’s... well, the detective
has feelings for me,

27:48.884 --> 27:50.494
but she has no control
over those feelings.

27:50.538 --> 27:51.757
Okay, I don'’t get that.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.149
Well, look,
it'’s difficult to explain.

27:53.193 --> 27:57.023
But I just...
[sighs]

27:57.066 --> 27:58.851
I just want to do right by her.

27:58.894 --> 28:01.201
I believe you. Yeah.

28:01.244 --> 28:03.290
Swap.

28:03.333 --> 28:06.510
Do you ever ask yourself,

28:06.554 --> 28:09.165
"How the hell
did I end up here?"

28:09.209 --> 28:10.993
What, eating mint
chocolate chip ice cream,

28:11.037 --> 28:12.516
wrapped in a pink Snuggie?

28:12.560 --> 28:13.779
[laughs softly]

28:13.822 --> 28:15.650
Pink'’s a good color for you,
actually.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.783
Ah! You are a good
liar, aren'’t you?

28:17.826 --> 28:18.784
I don'’t lie.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.437
Forgive me,

28:20.481 --> 28:21.743
but you are a con woman.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.745
I am not a con woman.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.225
I am a singer,

28:25.268 --> 28:28.402
forced to do some things
that I'’m not proud of,

28:28.445 --> 28:31.187
but only so I can dig
my dad'’s club out of debt.

28:31.231 --> 28:34.190
I grew up on that stage.
It'’s my home.

28:34.234 --> 28:36.889
Drastic measures
for the things we care about.

28:36.932 --> 28:38.281
That, I get.

28:38.325 --> 28:40.066
[chuckles]

28:40.109 --> 28:41.894
I might pretend to be someone

28:41.937 --> 28:44.548
a little less threatening
sometimes,

28:44.592 --> 28:46.376
but I don'’t lie.

28:47.813 --> 28:48.814
I call it bluffing.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.119
Totally different things.

28:50.163 --> 28:53.253
Oh, well, that I definitely get.
[laughs]

28:53.296 --> 28:55.385
We'’re quite similar,
you and I, aren'’t we?

28:55.429 --> 28:57.300
Yeah, we are.

28:57.344 --> 29:01.565
Mm. Except for the fact
that you have ginormous feet.

29:01.609 --> 29:02.566

29:07.833 --> 29:09.443
You know...

29:09.486 --> 29:14.013
there might be a way for you and
I to dig each other out, Candy.

29:16.929 --> 29:20.846
I'’ll pay off your debt
if you don'’t mind doing

29:20.889 --> 29:22.717
a little "bluffing" for me.

Hmm. Okay, so,

cared about her.

Candy?

29:58.927 --> 30:01.364
What are you doing here?
You'’re gonna ruin everything.

30:01.408 --> 30:03.845
I ...

30:03.889 --> 30:05.412
Uh...

30:08.807 --> 30:10.721
As much as I love the
Bettie Page vibe, you'’ve got

30:10.765 --> 30:13.072
a bull'’s-eye on your back; this
is hardly a good hiding place.

30:13.115 --> 30:14.377
But it is where my killer works.What...?

30:14.421 --> 30:15.726
You'’re onto Roxie as well?

30:15.770 --> 30:18.468
Until you and your sidekick
derailed things.

30:18.512 --> 30:20.427
Not my sidekick, and
I hate to disappoint,

30:20.470 --> 30:22.864
but Roxie Pagliani
did not kill your look-alike.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.083
Ali.

30:24.126 --> 30:25.867
Her name was Ali.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.086
She broke up with her boyfriend,

30:27.129 --> 30:28.609
so I said
she could stay with me.

30:28.652 --> 30:30.741
I was just trying
to be a good friend.

30:30.785 --> 30:32.004
Oh, man.

30:32.047 --> 30:33.614
I'’m so sorry.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.010
Anyway.

30:38.053 --> 30:41.013
Anyway, Roxie Pagliani
did not kill Ali

30:41.056 --> 30:42.666
or her husband in a
jealous fit of rage.

30:42.710 --> 30:45.017
I mean, the woman'’s about as
passionate as a protein bar.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.583
This has nothing to do
with passion.

30:46.627 --> 30:49.195
The killer wants
my father'’s club.

30:49.238 --> 30:51.240
Fletcher'’s?
How do you know that?

30:51.284 --> 30:53.547
After I found Ali dead,

30:53.590 --> 30:57.029
I noticed there was only one
thing missing from my apartment.

30:57.072 --> 30:58.465
The pocket deed for Fletcher'’s.

30:58.508 --> 31:00.336
Whoever possesses the deed
owns the club.

31:00.380 --> 31:01.642
CANDY: It was used
as collateral

31:01.685 --> 31:03.035
when my dad
borrowed money from Louie.

31:03.078 --> 31:05.341
But when I went
to confront him,

31:05.385 --> 31:06.908
he was already dead.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.389
Oh, that'’s why her hair
was at the crime scene.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.957
So I thought, well, maybe Louie
told Roxie about the deed,

31:12.000 --> 31:13.175
and she'’s the one
who got greedy.

31:13.219 --> 31:14.611
LUCIFER:
Sadly, no.

31:14.655 --> 31:16.352
Roxie was working
at the time of the murder.

31:16.396 --> 31:19.355
But who else could'’ve known
about that deed?

31:19.399 --> 31:20.879
Well, not to worry.

31:20.922 --> 31:24.230
There'’s a much faster way
to flush out the killer.

31:24.273 --> 31:26.623
Candy'’s still my wife.
Legally, anyway.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.495
Which would trump
any sort of deed.

31:28.538 --> 31:30.018
Exactly, which means Fletcher'’s

31:30.062 --> 31:32.542
now goes
to the grieving widower, me.

31:32.586 --> 31:34.414

that makes you

37:11.925 --> 37:13.405
before you

37:13.448 --> 37:15.363
is that because
I know you'’re the killer

37:43.086 --> 37:45.611
Well, interesting turn
of phrase, actually, Juddy,

37:45.654 --> 37:47.047
