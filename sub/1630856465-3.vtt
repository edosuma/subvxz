WEBVTT

00:20.396 --> 00:22.648
- I can't stay here...
- Clara. Please.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.400
No, no, no, no.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.235
If you could step outside
for a moment, Your Lordship?

00:26.235 --> 00:28.028
<i>I believe I know
what you're thinking, sir,</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:29.488
But it was an accident.

00:29.488 --> 00:32.491
It turns out that this
chivalrous clergyman

00:32.491 --> 00:36.245
is your brother, Lord Trenchard.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.997
I didn't realize
James lives so close by.

00:37.997 --> 00:41.375
My brother supplanted me
in my father's affections.

00:41.375 --> 00:45.045
From the day he was born,
he turned my father against me.

00:45.045 --> 00:48.007
I hope I'll meet him soon.
You like him, I think?

00:48.007 --> 00:50.050
I like everything about him.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.178
How is our poor girl?

00:52.178 --> 00:54.221
She can't
stay here indefinitely.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.056
Propriety forbids it.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.851
You know, it really would help
if you could tell me your name.

00:58.851 --> 00:59.852
Nell.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.562
We have our first miracle.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.773
No one will ever hear
a single word

01:03.773 --> 01:05.858
about your past from me.

01:05.858 --> 01:08.068
I received a note
from Lord Trenchard.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.528
A business proposition.

01:09.528 --> 01:11.697
He has no need to make money.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.449
I want something
on a larger scale.

01:13.449 --> 01:14.909
It takes only
10 or 20 minutes

01:14.909 --> 01:18.204
to convert five tons of iron
into steel.

01:18.204 --> 01:20.456
Might the proposal
be of interest to you?

01:20.456 --> 01:24.251
Clara--she is not
an ordinary girl.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.378
<i>You should trust her.</i>

01:26.378 --> 01:28.380
They seem happy,

01:28.380 --> 01:30.049
especially since
they went to Glanville.

01:30.049 --> 01:32.051
<i>What happened there then?</i>

01:32.051 --> 01:33.552
You make me strong.

01:33.552 --> 01:36.055
Lady Trenchard?
I called in on you again.

01:36.055 --> 01:37.223
Yes, I know.

01:37.223 --> 01:38.724
You seemed unhappy
that night.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.101
You know nothing about me
or my husband.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.895
You know nothing of what
he's had to deal with.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.772
Please stay away from us.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.774
Does His Lordship's brother
ever call here?

01:46.774 --> 01:49.777
Some things
are better left well alone.

01:49.777 --> 01:52.571
- And some are better mended.
- Not this.

03:13.319 --> 03:14.570
Whew!

03:14.570 --> 03:16.822
Ellerby?
My God! What on earth?

03:16.822 --> 03:18.240
The blood's not mine.
It's other people's.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.491
We're fine.

03:19.491 --> 03:20.868
There was
some trouble at the end.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.369
The police charged
into the crowd.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.372
What? I... I thought
it was a legitimate rally.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.082
It was.
There was no need for it.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.417
But no one was killed?

03:28.417 --> 03:30.502
No, no.
A lot of cuts to the head

03:30.502 --> 03:32.004
and some badly beaten
arms and legs.

03:32.004 --> 03:35.257
- He saw to most of them.
- It was madness.

03:35.257 --> 03:38.385
Injuries like that can ruin
a working man's career.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.847
We had to save one man
from being arrested.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.432
He was concussed.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.017
We pretty much had to carry him
back to the road

03:45.017 --> 03:46.435
with police whistles blowing
behind us.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.228
Right.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.731
This is the last time I send
you two off for an afternoon

03:50.731 --> 03:52.191
- in the country.
- Oh, stop.

03:52.191 --> 03:53.692
Until then it was actually
a great day.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.069
It was a great turnout.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.029
There were even speakers
from the London Corporation,

03:57.029 --> 03:58.864
saying the enclosure
should be stopped.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.532
But at least now the press
will have to report it.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.576
Yes, but imagine
what they'll say.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.703
"Riots on Wanstead Flats.

04:04.703 --> 04:07.456
Violent protestors
tear down fences."

04:07.456 --> 04:10.292
Hopefully some people
will guess the truth of it.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.961
Uh, don't tell me
someone's actually

04:11.961 --> 04:14.213
paid you, Stephen Ellerby?

04:14.213 --> 04:16.882
Lord Trenchard.
Payment in full.

04:16.882 --> 04:20.427
- Ah. He of the beautiful wife.
- Yes. The beautiful wife

04:20.427 --> 04:24.056
who I shall probably
never see again.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.809
To freedom
and surviving the fray.

04:43.534 --> 04:46.495
I love you.

04:48.998 --> 04:51.792
If we were
to have a daughter one day,

04:51.792 --> 04:53.794
what would we call her?

04:56.171 --> 04:59.508
What would you like to call her?

04:59.508 --> 05:01.635
I don't know.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.847
Isabelle, perhaps.

05:04.847 --> 05:07.474
Isabelle Clara Trenchard.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.811
I like "Clara."

05:10.811 --> 05:12.271
It was my grandmother's name.

05:12.271 --> 05:17.109
Our son would be Frederick,
of course.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.361
Hmm, he wouldn't have to be.

05:19.361 --> 05:22.281
Were you named for anyone?

05:22.281 --> 05:23.991
No.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.493
They picked my name
out of the ether.

05:26.493 --> 05:30.956
My grandfather's name was James.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.958
I sometimes wonder...

05:32.958 --> 05:35.711
What?

05:35.711 --> 05:38.547
I only hope I would be a better
father than I was a son.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.926
I won't let you do this.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.224
I won't let you do this.

05:56.482 --> 05:58.192
I can do that, Your Ladyship.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.947
- Did you find the address?
- Yes.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.457
Good. We'll need the carriage.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.135
Come with me.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.017
You are to take care
that this child

06:32.017 --> 06:34.269
be brought to the bishop
to be confirmed by him,

06:34.269 --> 06:36.522
so soon as he can say the Creed,
the Lord's Prayer,

06:36.522 --> 06:38.273
and the Ten Commandments
in the vulgar tongue.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.442
Be further instructed

06:40.442 --> 06:42.528
in the Church Catechism
set forth for that purpose.

06:42.528 --> 06:45.531
There, little fellow.

06:45.531 --> 06:46.406
Welcome.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.870
Thank you, Reverend Trenchard.
A beautiful service.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.372
My pleasure.

06:53.372 --> 06:55.707
I look forward to baptisms
more than anything else.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.543
- A church?
- Yes.

06:57.543 --> 06:58.627
In Chelsea.

06:58.627 --> 07:01.588
And the Vicar...

07:01.588 --> 07:04.383
was the Reverend Mr. Trenchard.

07:04.383 --> 07:08.262
Does His Lordship
have a brother? A cousin?

07:08.262 --> 07:10.222
I did hear about a brother,

07:10.222 --> 07:11.765
but he's never come here
to my knowledge.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.308
Perhaps they're estranged.

07:13.308 --> 07:16.145
I don't know, and we're
certainly not encouraged to ask.

07:16.145 --> 07:18.564
His Lordship
does have a brother,

07:18.564 --> 07:21.316
the Reverend James Trenchard.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.777
May I ask how he's come
to your attention?

07:23.777 --> 07:26.280
I just heard mention
of the name, that's all.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.991
Wondered if he might be related.

07:28.991 --> 07:34.121
Well, if he should ever
happen to come here,

07:34.121 --> 07:36.331
please come
and fetch me at once.

07:36.331 --> 07:39.668
- I'll deal with him personally.
- Yes, Mr. Enright.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.505
Well...

07:43.505 --> 07:44.423
he knows something.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.133
Hmm.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.136
Thank you.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.429
Nell...

07:50.429 --> 07:53.932
Yes, sir.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.684
Mrs. Dunn...

07:55.684 --> 07:57.144
It's a great pleasure
to meet you at last.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.814
Oh, and you, too,
I must say, Reverend.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.650
Your name is mentioned on almost
a daily basis.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.319
Mother exaggerates.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.778
Well, I'm glad to hear that

08:06.778 --> 08:08.197
I've achieved
a degree of notoriety.

08:09.615 --> 08:13.577
Please, sit down.
The tea please, Nell.

08:16.622 --> 08:19.791
I hope that I shall see you
at St. Jude's before too long.

08:19.791 --> 08:24.129
Oh, yes.
Yes, I do hope so, too.

08:24.129 --> 08:27.633
I must confess,
I have found it rather difficult

08:27.633 --> 08:31.178
to, um, venture forth
since we came here.

08:31.178 --> 08:34.348
The change, I suppose, since...

08:34.348 --> 08:38.977
losing my beloved husband
and then being quite uprooted.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.813
I completely understand.

08:41.813 --> 08:46.068
You have lost
the center of your world.

08:46.068 --> 08:51.573
Yes, I... I have.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.075
How kind you are.

08:53.075 --> 08:57.496
He was the center of my world,

08:57.496 --> 08:59.748
of all our worlds.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.333
Well, as long as you know

09:01.333 --> 09:03.168
there's a warm welcome
awaiting you.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.586
We're not
a very frightening bunch,

09:04.586 --> 09:06.255
are we, Miss Dunn?

09:06.255 --> 09:08.382
Quite the opposite.

09:08.382 --> 09:11.677
And you, Reverend Trenchard,
are you a married gentleman?

09:11.677 --> 09:13.679
I'm not.

09:13.679 --> 09:16.556
Oh, I should have thought
you would be.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.519
- You are extremely handsome.
- Mother...

09:20.519 --> 09:23.939
I... I would have thought you
would need a wife for succor.

09:23.939 --> 09:27.943
I am so absorbed in my ministry.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.861
And my... my parish ladies

09:29.861 --> 09:32.406
couldn't be
more helpful and, uh...

09:32.406 --> 09:35.909
But not for... succor.

09:38.453 --> 09:41.790
What did you think
of our dear Nell, Reverend?

09:41.790 --> 09:45.585
Wonderful, really, to see her
looking so much recovered.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.045
Yeah.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.589
Thank you both
for what you've done.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.725
Is there anything
I can do for you?

09:59.725 --> 10:01.685
Any help I can offer?

10:05.188 --> 10:08.483
Is there someone I might
write to, to say you're safe?

10:08.483 --> 10:11.278
I needn't say where you are.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.656
There's no need. Thank you.

10:14.656 --> 10:18.618
You have been through
some troubling times, I think.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.165
In our darkest hours,
it's easy to believe

10:23.165 --> 10:26.418
that the Lord doesn't see us...

10:26.418 --> 10:29.629
but he does.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.632
And his love endures...

10:32.632 --> 10:35.302
no matter how we fail.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.019
Dear Lord...

10:44.019 --> 10:46.355
bless your servant, Nell.

10:49.024 --> 10:52.277
Let her feel
the warmth of your spirit,

10:52.277 --> 10:56.782
so that she knows
that she is not alone.

10:56.782 --> 10:58.325
I thought you'd like to know
that the Mrs. White

10:58.325 --> 11:00.994
have been telling me
about the annual bazaar.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.623
- Ah, yes?
- Yes.

11:04.623 --> 11:08.293
And I have volunteered
to take charge of proceedings.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.337
I hope that meets
with your approval.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.215
Forgive me, but...
the Lord be praised,

11:13.215 --> 11:15.801
the last couple of years
it's been something of a, uh--

11:15.801 --> 11:18.178
A fiasco?

11:18.178 --> 11:20.055
I gathered.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.182
Well, not anymore.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.017
I couldn't be more grateful.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.422
<i>The Marquise
is avoiding us.</i>

11:53.422 --> 11:55.048
<i>That's my opinion.</i>

11:55.048 --> 11:57.592
<i>She's had the proposal
for nigh on a week.</i>

11:57.592 --> 11:59.594
There was someone
in the house, Your Lordship.

11:59.594 --> 12:02.180
Even if there's work going on,
she has staff.

12:02.180 --> 12:05.392
They saw me,
and they decided not to open up.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.436
I expect she simply needs
more time.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.354
Or a little wooing.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.232
"Wooing"?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.359
Yes, Ross. I'm sure
you remember what that is.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.361
We're not dealing
with a regular investor.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.029
Perhaps we should be.

12:18.029 --> 12:20.031
The Duke of Rochester
has invited us

12:20.031 --> 12:22.909
down to Kent, Maywood,
to celebrate his birthday.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.871
I'm told the Marquise
will be one of the party.

12:25.871 --> 12:28.540
She won't be able
to avoid me there.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.375
Where are we with the licenses
for the converters?

12:30.375 --> 12:31.918
Almost ready for signing,
Your Lordship.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.378
And the warehouse?

12:33.378 --> 12:34.504
They've all agreed to the price.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.721
Then let's buy it.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.890
I'll secure the Marquise.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.099
Let's be ready to move quickly.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.988
Welcome.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.282
Welcome to Maywood,
you appallingly handsome pair.

13:29.518 --> 13:31.853
Do you mind if I go
in search of the Marquise?

13:31.853 --> 13:33.855
Of course not.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.482
Do you want me to come with you?

13:35.482 --> 13:39.444
I shall make the opening salvo,
leave you to settle in.

13:39.444 --> 13:40.987
You'll tell me

13:40.987 --> 13:42.822
when there's anything
I can say or do to help?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.699
You can be yourself,

13:44.699 --> 13:47.118
your honest and courageous self.

13:47.118 --> 13:49.996
That's proved
extremely effective so far.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.460
Very good.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.670
I've secured a second investor

13:56.670 --> 13:59.297
and have offers
from a further two.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.007
Given that
I approached you first,

14:01.007 --> 14:02.717
I've told them I intend
to give you first refusal,

14:02.717 --> 14:05.845
but time is tight.

14:05.845 --> 14:10.684
Frederick, you really think
I won't recognize this tactic.

14:10.684 --> 14:14.187
I have used the same one myself
many times in the past.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.690
Tactic perhaps,
but the facts remain.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.024
We have the warehouse,

14:18.024 --> 14:19.651
The deal
with Abercrombie's is done.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.152
We have the license
from Bessemer.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.821
And you have these
other lucky investors.

14:22.821 --> 14:25.031
Why do you need me?

14:25.031 --> 14:26.825
Because doing business
with anyone else

14:26.825 --> 14:30.537
would not be so... enticing.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.163
And for us, I hope this would be

14:32.163 --> 14:35.041
the first of many
profitable joint endeavors.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.378
So bullish today.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.840
With reason.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.071
Bravo! Bravo!
Now then, Randolph,

15:05.071 --> 15:06.531
make way for the maestro.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.199
You can't play, Papa.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.619
What's that? How dare you?
Can't play?

15:10.619 --> 15:13.747
- I am practically a virtuoso.
- No, you're not!

15:13.747 --> 15:17.375
Now, then, what have we here?
Ah, yes, right.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.127
It's upside down.

15:19.127 --> 15:24.799
Now, I shall count us in.
One, two, three, four, five.

15:24.799 --> 15:25.800
Papa!

15:31.222 --> 15:33.266
Dr. Ellerby...

15:33.266 --> 15:34.726
Do you know,
I completely forgot.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.812
I meant to learn!
But then I didn't!

15:39.939 --> 15:41.441
I'm sorry.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.901
I see now that
I should have warned you.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.819
No, not at all.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.821
Simply wondered if he's going
to be one of the party?

15:46.821 --> 15:50.784
Oh no, no. Please don't worry.
You'll hardly see him.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.330
Dr. Ellerby has a colleague,

15:55.330 --> 15:58.958
an acquaintance, who runs
a particular sort of clinic,

15:58.958 --> 16:01.753
very close by here,
as it happens.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.422
And the Duke
has reluctantly agreed

16:04.422 --> 16:06.633
that we should pay a visit,

16:06.633 --> 16:09.302
find out a little more
about the work they do.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.763
- This is in relation to...
- Peter...

16:11.763 --> 16:14.766
- Yes.
- How is he?

16:14.766 --> 16:16.685
I've often wanted to ask.

16:16.685 --> 16:22.816
The older he gets,
the more difficult it becomes.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.777
Do people talk about him?

16:25.777 --> 16:27.779
Gossip?

16:27.779 --> 16:29.781
I've never heard
anyone say anything.

16:29.781 --> 16:33.535
But then, people don't tend
to gossip in front of me.

16:33.535 --> 16:36.454
The Rochesters
have another son,

16:36.454 --> 16:39.708
their firstborn.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.960
Do you remember
when you said you saw a boy

16:41.960 --> 16:44.504
on the steps of their house?

16:44.504 --> 16:46.005
Yes.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.842
I saw him again,

16:48.842 --> 16:50.677
in the garden at Eaton Square.

16:50.677 --> 16:54.806
He suffers
from some sort of affliction.

16:54.806 --> 16:57.016
It's quite awful.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.811
A sort of madness.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.689
It seems Ellerby
is involved in his care.

17:10.238 --> 17:13.074
It's so sad.

17:13.074 --> 17:16.244
Oh, I still wish
Ellerby wasn't here.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.332
That night...

17:21.332 --> 17:23.418
those days...

17:23.418 --> 17:25.378
they're far behind us.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.855
Lady Trenchard.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.024
Good morning.

17:46.024 --> 17:49.235
- Good morning.
- Would you like me to go

17:49.235 --> 17:50.862
somewhere else
in search of shelter?

17:50.862 --> 17:52.739
You may do as you please.

17:56.034 --> 17:59.621
How is your little patient?

17:59.621 --> 18:02.540
I've been told something
of his situation.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.542
Well, in that case...

18:04.542 --> 18:08.713
I'm sincerely hoping
I can make life easier for him.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.423
Good.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.092
There is no known cure for
his condition, in spite of what

18:13.092 --> 18:15.762
traditional doctors claim,
but I do hope to help.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.389
You don't consider yourself
a traditional doctor?

18:18.389 --> 18:21.476
I consider myself a progressive.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.728
I don't reject all aspects
of traditional medicine.

18:23.728 --> 18:26.147
I trained in it.

18:26.147 --> 18:29.108
But I do think we should be
moving beyond leeches.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.736
So how would you go about
treating someone?

18:31.736 --> 18:33.321
It depends on their condition,

18:33.321 --> 18:36.741
but at the moment I'm very much
influenced by hydropaths.

18:36.741 --> 18:38.243
And those who prioritize nature

18:38.243 --> 18:40.954
in treating
diseases of the mind.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.247
William Morris,
the "Pre-Raphaelite" artists--

18:42.247 --> 18:43.748
they inspire me.

18:43.748 --> 18:46.251
The idea that
men are a part of nature

18:46.251 --> 18:49.087
and that we seek to detach
ourselves from her at our peril.

18:49.087 --> 18:52.799
You are convinced, I suppose,
by Mr. Darwin's theories?

18:52.799 --> 18:54.801
I am. Yes.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.762
I was on Wanstead Flats
not long ago,

18:57.762 --> 18:59.764
the good people
of Spitalfields and Bow

18:59.764 --> 19:01.474
were trying to stop their
common land being denied them.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.685
Now try telling them
that they don't need

19:03.685 --> 19:07.021
fresh air and grass
and daisy chains.

19:07.021 --> 19:10.024
I've always found fresh air
to be a better cure than any.

19:10.024 --> 19:12.777
I only wish we could convince
the politicians of that.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.612
Then they wonder why the cholera

19:14.612 --> 19:16.990
in the East End
is raging out of control.

19:16.990 --> 19:22.120
You know, I really am sorry
that I offended you that night.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.706
You didn't.

19:24.706 --> 19:27.000
I barely recall it.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.962
Ah, I believe it's stopping.

19:30.962 --> 19:35.300
Good day.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.718
So, how's the world of commerce,

19:36.718 --> 19:38.636
- Trenchard?
- Thriving.

19:38.636 --> 19:39.637
Is it true
that they mean to build

19:39.637 --> 19:41.306
a railway underneath the Thames?

19:41.306 --> 19:43.641
I hope so.
I hope to supply the steel

19:43.641 --> 19:45.393
- for the tracks.
- How?

19:45.393 --> 19:47.478
Ship it in, I suppose?

19:47.478 --> 19:49.981
Trenchard's a regular
"Merchant," Madame.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.482
Oh, I know.

19:51.482 --> 19:54.360
I intend to manufacture it,
in my new steel foundry.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.321
- Steel foundry?
- I must say, you never cease

19:56.321 --> 19:58.031
to surprise us.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.158
Dirty business
I should think, steel.

20:00.158 --> 20:02.827
Luckily I don't have to do
too much of the work myself.

20:02.827 --> 20:06.164
Pig iron.
Pig iron's involved, is it?

20:06.164 --> 20:10.835
Must you, dear?
Such an unpleasant expression.

20:10.835 --> 20:12.211
Good morning.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.547
You are glowing, my dear.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.758
Fresh air.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.217
I can recommend it.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.764
Your Graces,
may I present Dr. Kerry?

20:22.764 --> 20:24.015
Your Graces, it's a pleasure
to welcome you

20:24.015 --> 20:25.850
- to Daraway Park.
- How do you do?

20:25.850 --> 20:28.102
Thank you for seeing us,
Dr. Kerry.

20:28.102 --> 20:29.812
Ah, please.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.696
Our aim is to achieve

20:38.696 --> 20:40.949
a state of complete calm
and relaxation

20:40.949 --> 20:42.367
in our patients.

20:42.367 --> 20:43.868
Overstimulation
I've found to be a factor

20:43.868 --> 20:46.371
in many cases
of mental disturbance.

20:46.371 --> 20:50.291
We aim to protect
our patients from that.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.586
I think Dr. Ellerby has talked
to you about hydrotherapy?

20:53.586 --> 20:54.921
Yes.

20:54.921 --> 20:59.717
This shows
the immersive baths we use.

20:59.717 --> 21:03.054
The water
is full of beneficial minerals.

21:03.054 --> 21:05.223
And I've known patients
so relaxed after a treatment

21:05.223 --> 21:07.642
they slip
into a sort of trance.

21:07.642 --> 21:10.061
Tremendously restful
for the mind.

21:10.061 --> 21:13.773
I think many of us
could benefit from that.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.400
We take each of the patients

21:15.400 --> 21:17.235
for a walk in the grounds
every day.

21:17.235 --> 21:20.279
And we encourage them
to breathe...

21:21.739 --> 21:24.575
...in a particularly deep
and regulated way.

21:24.575 --> 21:26.619
Patients come to me
every few days,

21:26.619 --> 21:28.830
and we sit and talk quietly

21:28.830 --> 21:30.415
about anything
which is troubling them.

21:30.415 --> 21:34.669
Peter, Lord Chatham,
doesn't talk a great deal.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.421
He can say as little
or as much as he chooses.

21:36.421 --> 21:40.091
Can you tell me
a little about your son?

21:40.091 --> 21:44.971
He has intermittent seizures,
I understand?

21:44.971 --> 21:47.598
Yes. Quite frequently now.

21:47.598 --> 21:49.350
And so far, do you feel
that any of the treatment

21:49.350 --> 21:53.438
he's received
has improved his condition?

21:53.438 --> 21:54.522
I don't.

21:54.522 --> 21:57.108
Peter was--

21:57.108 --> 22:00.194
I have no wish
to speak about my son.

22:00.194 --> 22:01.195
Excuse me.

22:05.950 --> 22:06.868
Right.

22:19.922 --> 22:23.801
We don't normally
treat children, Your Grace.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.845
We don't think it's right

22:25.845 --> 22:27.346
to separate them
from their families.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.806
I've always thought that.

22:28.806 --> 22:31.976
But we would be honored
to treat your son here

22:31.976 --> 22:34.979
from time to time,
a day or two days.

22:34.979 --> 22:37.398
I could accompany him,
stay with him.

22:37.398 --> 22:39.150
I'd be glad to.

22:39.150 --> 22:44.238
We have some rooms
with private bathing facilities.

22:44.238 --> 22:47.325
I'll return
to Maywood later, if I may?

22:47.325 --> 22:49.035
Of course, Doctor. Thank you.

22:56.459 --> 22:58.711
Owns shares
in the place, does he?

22:58.711 --> 23:00.546
What do you mean?

23:00.546 --> 23:05.093
Well, any fellow
can put on a white coat

23:05.093 --> 23:08.846
and sit down
in a veritable stage set

23:08.846 --> 23:10.848
and pretend that they can
cure the world.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.269
Still...

23:15.269 --> 23:16.395
jolly good.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.524
Please don't do that.

23:19.524 --> 23:21.192
What?

23:21.192 --> 23:25.279
Pretend you didn't embarrass me
and behave abominably.

23:25.279 --> 23:27.532
I did not.

23:27.532 --> 23:29.492
Hardly said a word.

23:34.455 --> 23:37.291
Happy birthday, Percy.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.810
Marquise!

23:55.810 --> 23:58.896
I am being,
how do you say, nosy?

23:58.896 --> 24:02.066
Hmm.

24:02.066 --> 24:05.736
Your room is quite
as grand as mine.

24:05.736 --> 24:07.071
It's a beautiful house,
isn't it?

24:07.071 --> 24:08.114
It is.

24:09.824 --> 24:12.326
- For tonight?
- Yes. Do you like it?

24:12.326 --> 24:15.830
Of course. Simple. Unadorned.

24:15.830 --> 24:19.584
You yourself are the star.

24:19.584 --> 24:22.753
As one gets older,
we rely on our gowns to dazzle,

24:22.753 --> 24:24.964
whilst we take cover
in the wings.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.884
I hardly think
that's the case with you.

24:29.260 --> 24:31.846
- May I ask you something?
<i>- Bien sur.</i>

24:39.437 --> 24:41.606
What happened to your husband?

24:41.606 --> 24:44.192
Did you have a happy marriage?

24:44.192 --> 24:45.943
I so hope you did.

24:45.943 --> 24:47.195
He died.

24:47.195 --> 24:50.615
It's more than ten years now.

24:50.615 --> 24:54.535
And, yes, it was very happy.

24:54.535 --> 24:57.038
He was extremely wealthy,
so why not?

24:57.038 --> 24:58.331
Did you love him?

24:58.331 --> 25:01.626
Some days I liked him.

25:01.626 --> 25:04.128
Some days
I didn't like him at all.

25:04.128 --> 25:05.338
I've shocked you.

25:05.338 --> 25:06.964
No.

25:06.964 --> 25:09.508
My father was a bankrupt, Clara.

25:09.508 --> 25:13.471
I don't often tell people that.

25:13.471 --> 25:17.308
I had to sit and watch him
squander every penny we had.

25:17.308 --> 25:21.312
So, yes, I married for money.

25:21.312 --> 25:23.147
And when my husband became ill

25:23.147 --> 25:25.691
and couldn't manage
his affairs anymore,

25:25.691 --> 25:27.568
I managed them for him.

25:27.568 --> 25:31.322
I wasn't going to let
the same thing happen again.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.199
And that's when you learned
about business.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.492
Yes.

25:34.492 --> 25:37.536
It's not as difficult
as they pretend.

25:40.414 --> 25:43.417
Do you talk to Frederick
about his businesses?

25:43.417 --> 25:45.544
Sometimes.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.047
I like to know
what he's preoccupied with.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.341
You know
about the steel foundry?

25:50.341 --> 25:52.051
Yes.

25:52.051 --> 25:56.764
I know that he's passionate
about it, and confident.

25:56.764 --> 26:00.017
I'm thinking of investing in it.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.269
Do you think I should?

26:02.937 --> 26:06.691
Would it make you
happy if I did?

26:06.691 --> 26:07.900
Yes.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.068
Very.

26:18.035 --> 26:19.203
...myself saying
exactly the same thing.

26:19.203 --> 26:20.746
Look!

26:21.956 --> 26:23.457
Oh, I say!

26:28.421 --> 26:30.047
Happy birthday, dearest Duke.

26:30.047 --> 26:32.633
Happy birthday!

26:32.633 --> 26:35.428
Thank you, my friends.
Thank you, thank you.

26:35.428 --> 26:38.597
Older but not wiser, what?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.433
Older but not wiser.

26:43.311 --> 26:46.605
Now then, which scallywag
gets the first slice?

26:46.605 --> 26:48.441
Me!

26:48.441 --> 26:50.568
I think it needs regulation.

26:50.568 --> 26:53.070
The government
should probably be intervening.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.448
I'm not sure if they will...

26:55.448 --> 26:57.450
Frederick.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.660
Would you join me for a moment?

26:59.660 --> 27:01.954
Of course, Madame.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.289
Excuse me.

27:12.757 --> 27:15.343
Let us talk about figures.

27:15.343 --> 27:18.095
Perhaps you should warn Clara
that we may be some time?

27:42.161 --> 27:44.288
I'm sorry
we kept you captive so long.

27:44.288 --> 27:45.790
We had our own party.

27:45.790 --> 27:47.958
We did.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.668
Goodnight, <i>mon ami.</i>

27:54.799 --> 27:58.219
Happy birthday, old friend.

28:04.266 --> 28:06.477
What would you do, Frederick?

28:06.477 --> 28:08.312
About?

28:08.312 --> 28:10.356
The damned business with Peter.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.900
Duchess told me you were going
to visit a clinic.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.819
Less said about that,
the better.

28:14.819 --> 28:16.987
Bloody fellow, Ellerby,

28:16.987 --> 28:19.365
insinuating himself
into her trust.

28:22.910 --> 28:27.540
It takes centuries
to build a name like mine.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.875
The merest hint
of madness in the blood,

28:29.875 --> 28:33.045
and it's all... over.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.172
Why did it
have to be the eldest?

28:35.172 --> 28:38.175
What sin have I committed to--

28:38.175 --> 28:40.386
I have to think about
the other children,

28:40.386 --> 28:41.846
- you understand?
- Yes.

28:41.846 --> 28:44.181
I want them
to make good matches.

28:44.181 --> 28:47.768
To... To thrive,
to live wonderful lives.

28:47.768 --> 28:50.604
Mary doesn't see it that way.

28:50.604 --> 28:53.023
Or rather, she chooses not to.

28:53.023 --> 28:55.901
There shall come a time, soon,

28:55.901 --> 29:00.573
when I shall have to insist
that Peter be sent away.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.908
Far away.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.869
Better for everyone.

29:04.869 --> 29:07.121
It's not the boy's fault,
of course

29:07.121 --> 29:14.753
but, how can I help
but resent that he's there?

29:14.753 --> 29:17.047
It's a bitter thing, Frederick,

29:17.047 --> 29:18.716
to fail
with your firstborn son.

29:18.716 --> 29:21.552
Bitter thing.

29:34.815 --> 29:38.611
What did she say?

29:38.611 --> 29:39.945
Yes.

29:41.989 --> 29:44.283
More money than I'd hoped for.

29:44.283 --> 29:47.119
She said your faith in me
helped convince her.

29:52.333 --> 29:54.835
Congratulations.

29:57.171 --> 29:58.797
What is it?

29:58.797 --> 30:01.592
I was thinking about my father.

30:01.592 --> 30:05.429
He'd be proud of you, surely?

30:07.598 --> 30:10.309
Then he'd be a fool.

30:13.938 --> 30:15.981
I'm proud of you.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.069
I'm so proud.

30:21.862 --> 30:26.158
You're the finest man
I've ever met.

30:37.044 --> 30:38.796
Where are you taking me?

30:38.796 --> 30:40.130
Shh.

30:40.130 --> 30:42.841
Come on, follow me.

31:06.824 --> 31:07.866
Good morning.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.868
Lady Trenchard.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.328
I wanted to ask
your professional opinion

31:11.328 --> 31:12.913
about something.

31:12.913 --> 31:16.000
I often think that sadnesses
felt during childhood

31:16.000 --> 31:18.377
can embed themselves
in the mind,

31:18.377 --> 31:20.337
often in a disproportionate way.

31:20.337 --> 31:21.505
And could anything be done

31:21.505 --> 31:23.841
to help alleviate
such sadness in a person

31:23.841 --> 31:26.010
later in life, I mean?

31:26.010 --> 31:27.386
I think that something

31:27.386 --> 31:31.015
can be done about everything,
don't you?

31:31.015 --> 31:34.018
Some physicians think that
hypnosis can be a benefit,

31:34.018 --> 31:36.562
but that's an extremely
novel discipline.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.272
Personally, I think
it's in our natures

31:38.272 --> 31:40.357
to run away
from difficult feelings.

31:40.357 --> 31:42.443
But if we have the courage
to confront them,

31:42.443 --> 31:45.529
we can let go
of a great deal of pain.

31:45.529 --> 31:48.407
Find a more
balanced perspective.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.367
It seems to me that a lot of
the "monsters under our bed"

31:50.367 --> 31:53.704
aren't really monsters at all.

31:53.704 --> 31:55.372
I hope that has helped somewhat.

31:55.372 --> 31:57.541
It has.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.376
It's helped me
decide on something.

31:59.376 --> 32:01.462
Thank you.

32:01.462 --> 32:03.631
You have an interesting approach
to the world.

32:03.631 --> 32:06.300
I love the world
and everything in it.

32:08.010 --> 32:11.096
I'm leaving soon, so...

32:11.096 --> 32:13.057
it was very nice to talk to you.

32:13.057 --> 32:15.100
And you.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.769
Good luck, Your Ladyship.

32:32.743 --> 32:34.078
Has my husband left?

32:34.078 --> 32:37.623
Yes, Your Ladyship,
just this minute.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.249
Right.

32:39.249 --> 32:41.543
Let's be quick this morning.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.928
It arrived first thing.

32:50.928 --> 32:53.430
A lot of money, Your Lordship.

32:53.430 --> 32:54.932
It is.

32:54.932 --> 32:57.476
I'll have someone
run it over to the bank.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.103
Thought you'd like
to set eyes on it first.

32:59.103 --> 33:00.688
Good news on the converters.

33:00.688 --> 33:02.940
We've found an engineer
who knows what he's about,

33:02.940 --> 33:05.192
and we've poached a fellow
from Sheffield.

33:05.192 --> 33:07.152
So, I'd say we could have them
constructed in a week,

33:07.152 --> 33:08.987
ten days at most.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.280
It's happening.

33:10.280 --> 33:13.200
Well done, Ross.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.744
It's you who landed her,
Your Lordship.

33:18.747 --> 33:21.125
Mr. Fletcher!

33:21.125 --> 33:23.335
Don't like
the sound of that.

33:29.258 --> 33:32.553
That was someone
from the Duke's household.

33:32.553 --> 33:36.473
It seems you left this behind.

33:36.473 --> 33:39.184
Valuable items...

33:39.184 --> 33:42.187
would you agree?

33:42.187 --> 33:44.231
Yes.

33:44.231 --> 33:45.816
I'm sorry, Mr. Enright.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.317
I should have checked
more thoroughly.

33:47.317 --> 33:48.777
Won't happen again.

33:51.488 --> 33:52.531
Not what I expect of you.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.418
Best go and stand
in the corner, Mr. Fletcher.

34:28.525 --> 34:30.736
Robert says you asked for me,
Your Ladyship.

34:35.491 --> 34:37.242
Only into his hands.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.036
And wait for a reply.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.086
Yes, how can I help you?

34:48.086 --> 34:51.215
My name's Davison, sir,
a lady's maid.

34:51.215 --> 34:53.842
My mistress asked me
to give you this.

34:56.303 --> 34:58.430
She asked me
to wait for a reply.

35:15.364 --> 35:18.283
We're going out.

35:18.283 --> 35:21.954
But not in the carriage.
We shall take a cab.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.516
<i>How is my brother?</i>

35:42.516 --> 35:44.935
I can't tell you how glad I was
to hear that he's married.

35:44.935 --> 35:48.605
He's extremely well. Industrious.

35:48.605 --> 35:53.610
But he's very much troubled
at times...

35:53.610 --> 35:58.031
by thoughts of his father,
your father.

35:58.031 --> 35:59.992
This is very difficult.

35:59.992 --> 36:01.159
I'm not sure
how much he's told you.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.995
A little.

36:02.995 --> 36:07.457
There was a complicated rift
between him and our father.

36:07.457 --> 36:10.127
I strongly believe
it wasn't of Frederick's making.

36:10.127 --> 36:11.628
Then whose?

36:11.628 --> 36:13.881
I know Frederick thinks
it was of mine.

36:13.881 --> 36:16.133
When we were children,

36:16.133 --> 36:18.468
I can honestly say
that I was unaware,

36:18.468 --> 36:20.304
but as we grew older,

36:20.304 --> 36:25.976
yes... yes, I felt that
my father favored me,

36:25.976 --> 36:29.187
and he was harsh
towards Freddie.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.981
I should have been braver,

36:30.981 --> 36:33.567
but our father
was not easily challenged.

36:33.567 --> 36:35.861
I've been thinking...

36:35.861 --> 36:39.072
that it might help Frederick
if you would speak to him,

36:39.072 --> 36:40.699
if you could both
try to reconcile.

36:40.699 --> 36:45.370
I agree, and I have tried.
I want you to know that.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.164
When did you last try?

36:47.164 --> 36:51.209
Because Frederick
has changed of late.

36:51.209 --> 36:55.505
I think he would be more willing
to talk to you now.

36:55.505 --> 36:58.342
Has he said that
he would like to see me?

36:58.342 --> 37:00.844
No. Not exactly, but--

37:00.844 --> 37:03.680
I think the impetus
should be his.

37:03.680 --> 37:04.848
Don't you?

37:04.848 --> 37:06.516
If I move towards him,

37:06.516 --> 37:09.102
I fear he will retreat,
even now.

37:09.102 --> 37:11.271
In theory, though...

37:11.271 --> 37:13.357
you would be open
to a conversation?

37:13.357 --> 37:16.068
More than open. More than open.

37:16.068 --> 37:18.737
I... I miss him.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.906
I've lost my whole family.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.783
I miss my brother.

37:27.287 --> 37:28.872
Whoa.

37:28.872 --> 37:31.375
- Forgive me--
- No, I'll get it.

37:31.375 --> 37:35.712
Thank you, Your Lordship.

37:35.712 --> 37:38.757
My apologies.
I shall replace it immediately.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.594
Please tell Mrs. Enright

37:42.594 --> 37:45.597
that the eggs were
particularly good this morning.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.975
I will.

37:47.975 --> 37:50.352
Thank you, Your Lordship.

37:52.688 --> 37:54.773
What?

37:54.773 --> 37:56.942
You're very kind to him.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.568
- Enright?
- Hmm.

37:58.568 --> 38:00.946
I can hardly remember
life without him.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.073
I know he worries about his age,
growing infirm,

38:03.073 --> 38:04.866
but he'll always
have a home with me.

38:08.996 --> 38:12.791
I sometimes think about Emily...

38:12.791 --> 38:15.752
I mean, I've never known
a life without her.

38:15.752 --> 38:18.171
They mean a lot, don't they--

38:18.171 --> 38:20.507
the people who've known us
since we were children.

38:20.507 --> 38:23.760
The people who've watched us
being formed?

38:23.760 --> 38:27.305
It depends on how
those people made us feel.

38:27.305 --> 38:30.976
I think it's sometimes better
to let go of people.

38:30.976 --> 38:33.103
Then we can move freely
through the world...

38:33.103 --> 38:34.646
on our own terms.

38:43.947 --> 38:45.115
Well?

38:45.115 --> 38:47.617
How is he?

38:47.617 --> 38:50.996
Agitated.

38:50.996 --> 38:54.791
Dawes says he's been like that
for the past two days.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.127
Thinks another fit
may be coming.

38:57.127 --> 38:59.296
Well, we'd better
get Dr. Moorcroft in.

38:59.296 --> 39:02.299
Moorcroft, Mary. Yes?

39:02.299 --> 39:03.842
Let's get things
back under control.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.344
I've already sent for him.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.888
Excellent.

39:07.888 --> 39:09.639
It's for the best.

39:09.639 --> 39:12.559
You know, you could look in
on Peter yourself.

39:12.559 --> 39:15.395
I expect he's forgotten
what you look like by now.

39:19.232 --> 39:20.984
Just arrived, Your Ladyship.

39:20.984 --> 39:22.694
Thank you.

39:31.578 --> 39:34.706
From Dr. Ellerby...

39:34.706 --> 39:38.376
An invitation
to an art exhibition.

39:38.376 --> 39:41.838
Will you go, Your Ladyship?

39:41.838 --> 39:43.507
Perhaps.

39:43.507 --> 39:46.259
I like the idea of it.

39:46.259 --> 39:50.013
I'll speak to His Lordship.

39:50.013 --> 39:51.389
He's persistent.

39:51.389 --> 39:55.227
I'll give him that...

39:55.227 --> 39:57.771
the Doctor.

39:57.771 --> 40:00.398
He's being friendly, that's all.

40:42.232 --> 40:43.400
Mawd.

40:43.400 --> 40:46.570
As usual, please.

40:46.570 --> 40:47.821
Yes, Mr. Enright.

40:49.990 --> 40:52.576
What's this?

40:52.576 --> 40:55.078
Mawd's cousin
has been bothering her,

40:55.078 --> 40:57.747
asking her to put in
a good word with me

40:57.747 --> 40:59.624
about a position here.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.918
I've written to him
telling him there isn't one

41:01.918 --> 41:05.422
and that he should
leave her alone.

41:05.422 --> 41:06.673
Better in my own words.

41:06.673 --> 41:08.633
Ridiculous.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.927
You should learn
to stand up for yourself.

41:19.436 --> 41:22.439
Mine. Mother's.

41:22.439 --> 41:25.358
Still, if you're cold,
I suppose

41:25.358 --> 41:27.694
a blanket full of holes
is better than nothing.

41:27.694 --> 41:30.780
She drives me very hard, Clara,

41:30.780 --> 41:32.991
as though I were
a prisoner on a...

41:32.991 --> 41:34.659
- On a hulk.
- Well, it's supposed

41:34.659 --> 41:37.621
to be "knit one, pearl one,"
Mother, not "knit one,

41:37.621 --> 41:40.790
then have a little chat
and a cup of tea one."

41:40.790 --> 41:42.459
I'm doing my best.

41:42.459 --> 41:44.628
And one can't do any more
than that, can one?

41:44.628 --> 41:46.296
No.

41:46.296 --> 41:50.800
Oh, the bazaar
is an enormous undertaking.

41:50.800 --> 41:53.136
People really have no idea.

41:53.136 --> 41:55.305
The Reverend says,
"Thank goodness for you"

41:55.305 --> 41:56.932
on an almost daily basis.

42:01.144 --> 42:03.647
She seems sweet.

42:03.647 --> 42:06.983
Yeah, she's good as gold,
and she's very quiet.

42:06.983 --> 42:10.153
Some people are.

42:10.153 --> 42:12.322
I met
Reverend Trenchard recently.

42:12.322 --> 42:14.241
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.

42:14.241 --> 42:15.575
- Where?
- At the vicarage.

42:15.575 --> 42:18.495
Isn't he a delightful man?

42:18.495 --> 42:21.748
- I said to him--
- Did he talk about me?

42:21.748 --> 42:24.834
Yes, he said it had been
a pleasure to get to know you.

42:24.834 --> 42:28.171
- And you, too, Mother.
- That's nice.

42:28.171 --> 42:30.423
But he's seen
a great deal more of <i>me.</i>

42:30.423 --> 42:32.676
Will you be seeing him
again soon?

42:32.676 --> 42:35.011
Perhaps we can all
meet together one day?

42:35.011 --> 42:37.931
The brothers and the sisters.
The four of us.

42:44.938 --> 42:49.567
They aren't especially close,
um... brothers.

42:51.778 --> 42:53.196
Oh?

42:55.365 --> 42:57.117
I started to suspect as much.

42:57.117 --> 43:00.036
I hope, in time,
that might change.

43:00.036 --> 43:03.081
But I think it will require
some patience.

43:03.081 --> 43:04.541
I've realized that now.

43:04.541 --> 43:07.043
Well, I hope it won't become
an obstacle to...

43:15.093 --> 43:16.594
Pass this to Mother, please.

43:55.216 --> 43:57.761
Félicitations, <i>monsieur.</i>

43:57.761 --> 43:58.845
<i>Merci.</i>

44:10.190 --> 44:12.317
When will you change the sign?

44:12.317 --> 44:14.652
Trenchard Steel, surely?

44:14.652 --> 44:17.280
Unfortunately,
Abercrombie retains the name.

44:17.280 --> 44:20.283
Pity. You deserve
to have <i>your</i> name up there

44:20.283 --> 44:22.285
for all the world to admire.

44:22.285 --> 44:24.120
You're satisfied then, <i>madame?</i>

44:24.120 --> 44:28.541
Extremely. I wish all
my investments ran as smoothly.

44:28.541 --> 44:30.335
We must plan
another venture together soon.

44:30.335 --> 44:31.961
Ah!

44:31.961 --> 44:35.882
Perhaps. One day.

44:40.637 --> 44:42.347
How is dear Clara?

44:42.347 --> 44:45.350
She's thriving. Thank you.

45:30.311 --> 45:31.438
Enright. How are you?

45:34.607 --> 45:38.570
Well. Thank you, sir.

45:38.570 --> 45:40.321
I shall see to this, Robert.

45:43.950 --> 45:45.952
His Lordship is...

45:45.952 --> 45:47.704
Out? Yes.

45:47.704 --> 45:50.915
But it's actually Lady Trenchard
I've come to see today.

45:50.915 --> 45:52.709
I'm told that she's in.

45:52.709 --> 45:55.378
I believe she has recently
returned home, sir,

45:55.378 --> 45:57.547
but is most probably resting,
so perhaps--

45:57.547 --> 45:59.215
Would you mind checking?

45:59.215 --> 46:02.427
If you tell her I'm here,
I think she'll see me.

46:03.553 --> 46:04.762
Shall I wait here?

46:04.762 --> 46:08.391
No. No, sir.

46:08.391 --> 46:09.309
Please.

46:23.698 --> 46:26.326
Not now!

46:33.833 --> 46:36.503
Apologies, but there's someone
here for Her Ladyship.

46:36.503 --> 46:37.754
It's not convenient.

46:37.754 --> 46:40.548
Please tell her
it's Reverend Trenchard.

46:51.601 --> 46:52.810
Is Her Ladyship in?

46:52.810 --> 46:56.481
Yes, Your Lordship.
She has a visitor.

46:56.481 --> 46:57.774
Enright?

46:57.774 --> 46:59.609
What's wrong?

46:59.609 --> 47:00.944
You look as though
you've seen a ghost.

47:00.944 --> 47:03.821
No, Your Lordship. But, uh...

47:03.821 --> 47:07.116
Uh...

47:14.958 --> 47:18.044
- Frederick--
- Why are you here?

47:18.044 --> 47:20.672
I... I've come to see you...

47:20.672 --> 47:22.298
and Lady Trenchard.

47:22.298 --> 47:24.467
I thought I'd made myself clear
last time we spoke.

47:24.467 --> 47:27.762
- No further contact.
- Yes.

47:30.306 --> 47:32.350
But things change, don't they?

47:32.350 --> 47:34.602
And I always hope--

47:37.564 --> 47:39.524
Please leave.

47:39.524 --> 47:42.026
Frederick, I asked
your brother to come.

47:42.026 --> 47:43.653
This is entirely my fault.

47:43.653 --> 47:46.906
Although, fault implies...

47:46.906 --> 47:49.659
I thought it might be helpful
were you to see each other...

47:49.659 --> 47:52.870
- You have met?
- Once.

47:52.870 --> 47:54.414
I called at the vicarage.

47:54.414 --> 47:57.333
But only because
I was thinking...

47:59.085 --> 48:01.337
Lady Trenchard has done
nothing wrong, Frederick.

48:01.337 --> 48:04.674
- She was thinking only of you--
- Don't tell me about my wife.

48:04.674 --> 48:07.051
You thought you would
befriend her, I suppose?

48:07.051 --> 48:08.595
And whisper poison
in her ears about me?

48:08.595 --> 48:10.096
No, no, I didn't.

48:10.096 --> 48:13.016
- Frederick...
- Leave my house.

48:13.016 --> 48:14.601
Leave my house!

48:40.293 --> 48:43.880
I didn't plan that
he would come today.

48:43.880 --> 48:45.715
I thought there was more time.

48:45.715 --> 48:48.718
You went behind my back.

48:48.718 --> 48:50.011
Why would you do that?

48:54.641 --> 48:59.562
Because I thought...
Frederick... Frederick!

48:59.562 --> 49:02.065
Frederick!

49:02.065 --> 49:05.818
I'm sorry, Your Lordship.
I didn't know. I...

49:07.195 --> 49:09.197
Come, Your Ladyship.

49:16.663 --> 49:18.206
I didn't know.
