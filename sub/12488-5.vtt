09:17.223 --> 09:19.809
I will be leading
a moonlight nature walk.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.352
- Great.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.104
- And, if we're lucky,

09:23.187 --> 09:25.106
someone will get poison ivy
so we can witness

09:25.189 --> 09:28.734
the devastating power
of nature up close.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.487
Oh, it's gonna be so fun!

09:31.570 --> 09:34.031
- Burning and itching
--so fun.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.036
- Okay, once everyone leaves,
we can get set up.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.414
- I hid all the scaring supplies
behind the old shed.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.749
- You kids aren't messing around
Silas Potter's shed, are you?

09:43.833 --> 09:46.085
- Coach, you do not
believe in that, right?

09:46.168 --> 09:48.713
- Yeah, it's all made up.
- No, it's not.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.798
Fifty years ago today,

09:50.881 --> 09:53.551
some kids pulled a huge
scare on Silas Potter.

09:53.634 --> 09:54.552
They locked him in the shed.

09:54.635 --> 09:57.179
By the time they went
back to let him out,

09:57.263 --> 10:00.516
he had died of fright.

10:00.599 --> 10:02.143
- Really?

10:02.226 --> 10:06.480
- They say some nights
you can hear Silas' ghost

10:06.564 --> 10:10.901
banging against
the door saying...

10:10.985 --> 10:14.822
who locked me in here?
[tapping hands]

10:14.905 --> 10:16.741
So!
- ALL: [gasping]

10:16.824 --> 10:17.700
- I've gotta hit
the nature walk.

10:17.783 --> 10:23.039
Take my advice.
Stay away from that shed.

10:23.122 --> 10:26.292
- Guys, did you hear that?
If I have the lock--

10:26.375 --> 10:28.461
that means the shed is open
and Silas can get out.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.046
And to make it even worse,

10:30.129 --> 10:33.549
the interest on my savings
account just dropped by 2%.

10:33.632 --> 10:36.135
- Newt, my interest
is dropping even faster.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.637
So, come on, we've got
scaring to do.

10:38.721 --> 10:43.184
- [spooky music]

10:45.603 --> 10:47.063
- Why are you dressed
like that?

10:47.146 --> 10:49.231
- TROY: I'm Pepper's cat,
come back from the dead...

10:49.315 --> 10:55.529
as a zombie.
[growling]

10:55.613 --> 10:57.156
Is that too much?

10:57.239 --> 10:58.407
- Just right.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.369
- And what's more terrifying
than the Admiral's fried chicken

11:01.452 --> 11:03.579
delivered by
the Admiral himself?

11:03.662 --> 11:06.916
- Okay, everybody just quiet
down, all right?

11:06.999 --> 11:08.334
We don't wanna give
ourselves away.

11:08.417 --> 11:11.545
Just think about how awesome
this scare's gonna be.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.090
Hee. Hee. Hee. Hee.

11:14.173 --> 11:17.635
Yeah, I'm sorry.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.720
- [crunching outside tent]
- Oh, that must be them.

11:19.804 --> 11:20.763
Everybody, get ready.
- Quick.

11:20.846 --> 11:24.392
- Let me know when it's over.
I'm goin' fetal.

11:24.475 --> 11:28.437
- Uh, wait, who's that?

11:28.521 --> 11:29.730
- [chainsaw buzzing]

11:29.814 --> 11:31.732
- SAWYER &amp; TROY:
[screaming]

11:31.816 --> 11:33.067
- [snarling]

11:33.150 --> 11:36.237
- SAWYER, NEWT, TROY:
[screaming]

11:39.156 --> 11:41.242
- PEPPER, SOPHIE, BELLA:
Sha-Bo!-Ya!

11:41.325 --> 11:42.868
[laughing]

11:42.952 --> 11:45.496
- Still think girls aren't
good at scaring?

11:45.579 --> 11:46.997
- TROY: [high-pitched]
Okay.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.582
I'll admit...
[labored breathing]

11:48.666 --> 11:51.419
...maybe I was wrong.
- SOPHIE: Yep.

11:51.502 --> 11:54.171
- And thank you, Sawyer,
for this fried chicken.

11:54.255 --> 11:57.091
I don't care if he lied
about his military record.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.635
I love the Admiral.
[chomping chicken]

11:59.718 --> 12:00.845
- Wow, I can't believe this.

12:00.928 --> 12:04.723
That was sneaky, underhanded,
and just mean.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.267
I'm impressed.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.144
- I'm impressed
you pulled together

12:08.227 --> 12:11.147
a period-authentic
Admiral costume so quickly.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.691
- I have a guy.

12:13.774 --> 12:14.859
- Uh, Sophie?
- What, Newt?

12:14.942 --> 12:17.695
- Was anyone else helping
you with your scare?

12:17.778 --> 12:19.488
- No, it was just us.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.282
- Then who is that?

12:21.365 --> 12:23.784
- [door rattling]

12:23.868 --> 12:26.454
- Uh, is that...?
- It couldn't be.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.831
- It's Silas Potter.

12:28.914 --> 12:31.375
- [clippers snipping]

12:31.459 --> 12:33.627
- ALL: [screaming]

12:33.711 --> 12:37.173
- [clippers snipping]

12:41.385 --> 12:43.596
- ALL: [screaming]

12:43.679 --> 12:46.390
- TROY: Okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay!

12:46.474 --> 12:47.308
That was not Silas Potter.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.977
Who's playin' us?

12:50.060 --> 12:51.020
- I don't know.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.897
Everyone else is out
on the nature walk.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.190
- How do we know you
guys aren't behind this?

12:54.273 --> 12:55.691
- Really?

12:55.774 --> 12:58.444
Look how much more
scared we are than you.

12:58.527 --> 12:59.778
I mean...

12:59.862 --> 13:03.657
look how scared we all are.

13:03.741 --> 13:04.575
- This scare
is way too good.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.702
There's no way
the boys are behind this.

13:06.785 --> 13:09.914
- Hold up.
Maybe it was you, traitor.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.707
- Yeah, you were
playing both sides.

13:11.790 --> 13:12.833
How can any of us
trust you?

13:12.917 --> 13:15.586
- I don't think Bella has
anything to do with this.

13:15.669 --> 13:18.214
- Then who is it?
- Silas Potter.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.549
- That's just a spooky story.
- No, it's not.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.218
Coach said he's been
locked up all these years

13:22.301 --> 13:24.428
and I found his padlock,
so that must mean he's out.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.680
And he wants revenge.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.307
- Newt, that is crazy.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.894
- It is, Bella, is it?!

13:31.977 --> 13:34.939
- Yes, Newt, it...
it is crazy.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.274
- Okay, okay, fine,
don't believe me.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.567
But there's someone out there
who's trying to scare us

13:38.651 --> 13:41.070
and maybe worse than that.

13:41.153 --> 13:44.073
We can't just sit around and
talk--we have to do something.

13:44.156 --> 13:44.990
- Like what?

13:45.074 --> 13:47.535
- Well, I'm no horror
movie expert,

13:47.618 --> 13:48.619
but I think the best
thing to do is split up.

13:48.702 --> 13:51.956
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That's smart.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.123
- One group should find
a way to call their parents

13:53.207 --> 13:55.918
and the other should stay
here and barricade the door.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.878
- I have a spare cell
phone in my locker

13:57.962 --> 14:00.548
in case my brothers flush mine
down the toilet--again.

14:00.631 --> 14:01.840
I go through a lot
of cell phones.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.842
- Perfect--take Troy
and Sawyer with you

14:03.926 --> 14:06.095
and me, Bella, and Pepper
will stay here.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.597
There's a flashlight in
the locker room if you need it.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.558
- I think we'll be fine.

14:10.641 --> 14:15.437
- [power thuds]
- ALL: [screaming]

14:15.521 --> 14:18.107
- [dramatic music]

14:19.066 --> 14:21.026
- What do you think
those screams were?

14:21.110 --> 14:23.821
- Uh, it's probably just
the wind, you know,

14:23.904 --> 14:27.950
that old Texas...
screaming wind.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.994
- What if someone
saw Potter's ghost?

14:30.077 --> 14:31.954
Shouldn't someone go
down and investigate?

14:32.037 --> 14:33.872
- Huh. I...I don't know.
You should go.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.916
- I'm not in charge.
You should go.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.251
- Good news--I just
put you in charge.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.794
So you should go.

14:38.877 --> 14:42.089
- All right, since I'm in
charge, I'm sending you.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.091
- Fine. How about
neither of us go?

14:44.174 --> 14:45.801
- Oh...
that's good decision making.

14:45.884 --> 14:49.305
Keep it up and one day
you'll be back in charge.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.770
- It looks clear.

14:56.854 --> 14:57.438
- Let me check.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.190
Anybody in here?!

15:00.274 --> 15:02.610
- Shhhh!
- Okay.

15:02.693 --> 15:03.861
- Whose parents do we call?

15:03.944 --> 15:07.823
- Forget parents.
I'm calling the cops.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.493
- ALL: [screaming]

15:11.577 --> 15:12.870
- TROY: Oh, awesome!

15:12.953 --> 15:15.623
I totally forgot
I set that up earlier.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.166
Woo! That scare was so good,
I scared myself.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.793
[laughing]

15:19.877 --> 15:22.087
- [cell phone ringing]

15:22.171 --> 15:22.671
- Who is this?

15:22.755 --> 15:24.632
- Uh, I don't know.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.008
It says "Unknown."

15:26.091 --> 15:27.843
Only Bella and Pepper
know this number.

15:27.926 --> 15:29.178
- [phone continues ringing]

15:29.261 --> 15:31.180
- Oh.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.598
- Hello?

15:32.681 --> 15:34.850
- [clippers snipping]

15:34.933 --> 15:38.145
- MALE VOICE:
Who locked me in here?

15:38.228 --> 15:41.065
- ALL: [screaming]

15:43.025 --> 15:45.319

15:45.402 --> 15:48.030
- ALL: [screaming]

15:50.324 --> 15:52.576
- Sorry, I had to use
the little boys' room.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.454
Anyway, let's get started
on this barric--

15:55.537 --> 15:58.207
The barricade looks good.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.377
- Yep, there's no way
he's getting in here now.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.461
- So, what if Silas Potter

16:02.544 --> 16:04.213
walks straight through
because he's a ghost?

16:04.296 --> 16:06.382
Or worse--what if he can
turn into a zombie cat,

16:06.465 --> 16:08.133
and I think he's kinda cute
and I wanna pet him

16:08.217 --> 16:10.594
and he bites me and, boom,
I'm a zombie cat, too, and--

16:10.678 --> 16:12.221
- Pepper, breathe!

16:12.304 --> 16:13.722
- [inhaling]

16:13.806 --> 16:15.724
[exhaling]

16:15.808 --> 16:17.559
- No one is getting
through that door.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.436
We'll be fine.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.230
- [door thuds]
- ALL: [gasping]

16:21.313 --> 16:22.106
Coach?

16:22.189 --> 16:23.774
- What are you kids
doing in here?

16:23.857 --> 16:25.651
You should be on
your nature walk

16:25.734 --> 16:28.237
and why is this
door blocked?

16:28.320 --> 16:30.948
- ALL: [mixed
overlapping comments]

16:31.031 --> 16:33.909
- Okay, okay,
just let me in and you can--

16:33.992 --> 16:37.955
Oh! Oh! Ow! No!
Don't! Don't!

16:38.038 --> 16:40.082
- PEPPER, BELLA, NEWT:

- TROY, SAWYER, SOPHIE:

16:44.586 --> 16:45.671
- SAWYER:
Silas Potter is real!

16:45.754 --> 16:48.090
- We know! He got Coach!
- What?

16:48.173 --> 16:51.427
- We've gotta call for help.
Sophie, where's your phone?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.137
- Broken. Troy dropped it.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.597
- There was a hot
potato situation.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.350
It was everybody's fault.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.853
- We tried looking for a phone
upstairs, but no luck.

17:00.936 --> 17:01.812
- What are we gonna do?
- I know what to do.

17:01.895 --> 17:04.772
I just remembered
that Silas Potter rhyme.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.567
- Yeah, we know.

17:06.650 --> 17:07.401
♪ If you go
near Potter's shed ♪

17:07.483 --> 17:08.527
♪ You will surely
end up bread ♪

17:08.609 --> 17:10.194
How is that gonna help?

17:10.279 --> 17:13.906
- It's "dead" not "bread"
and there's a second part.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.909
"If this ghost
is ever free,

17:15.992 --> 17:17.786
lock him where
he's meant to be."

17:17.869 --> 17:19.329
- I don't think it works
unless you sing it.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.414
- I'm not gonna sing it.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.958
We've gotta lock Silas Potter
back in his shed.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.460
- What?! We can't
go out there.

17:24.542 --> 17:25.961
That is crazy!

17:26.044 --> 17:28.922
- It is, Bella, is it?!

17:29.006 --> 17:30.799
- Yes, Newt, it's still crazy.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.050
- Yeah, I suggest
not goin' there.

17:32.134 --> 17:36.346
- Okay, fine, I'm goin' in.
Last chance.

17:36.430 --> 17:36.805
Who's with me?

17:36.889 --> 17:40.267
- ALL: Oooh...

17:40.350 --> 17:43.645
- All right, I guess
it has to be me.

17:43.729 --> 17:48.025
- New, wait!
- No!

17:48.108 --> 17:49.943
- NEWT: Silas Potter,
show yourself!

17:50.027 --> 17:52.362
- Actually,
don't listen to him.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.989
Go somewhere far away.

17:54.072 --> 17:55.866
- Newt, come back inside.

17:55.949 --> 17:58.118
- No, I got this.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.662
I think.

18:00.746 --> 18:01.997
- Okay, look, the man
has got this.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.166
I'ma just go.
- No.

- It was nothing.

I'm just glad I got
out of that alive.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.211

Sha-Boo!-Ya!

19:01.807 --> 19:03.684
- Wait, what is going on?

19:03.767 --> 19:05.227
- I wanted you guys to know

19:05.310 --> 19:06.937
exactly how it feels
when you scare me

19:07.020 --> 19:08.188
and I knew the only
way to do that

19:08.272 --> 19:09.231
was to pull the biggest
scare ever.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.024
- COACH: [laughing]
- And you helped him?

19:11.108 --> 19:12.734
- I felt sorry for
the little guy.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.404
And I wanted revenge

19:15.487 --> 19:18.240
for you guys scaring me with
that...that clown thing.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.700
I mean, I wasn't scared.
Uh...

19:19.783 --> 19:22.411
clowns are stupid.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.705
- Wait. Okay, so if it
was just you two,

19:24.788 --> 19:26.748
who grabbed Coach?

19:26.832 --> 19:27.708

classes would never pay off.

19:35.173 --> 19:38.343
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing?

19:38.427 --> 19:43.098
- Your ex-wife and everyone who
knew you took mime classes.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.017
- Coach also shut off the lights
and called your phone.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.686
- But how did you
know that number?

19:47.769 --> 19:48.937
- I know all your
phone numbers--

19:49.021 --> 19:50.731
even your emergency one.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.650
- Yeah, I take back my kiss.

- You can't take
it from here.

- Uh, Newt, I have to
say I'm impressed.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.741
This is definitely
the best scare ever.

20:00.824 --> 20:04.202
- Yeah, it was amazing.
- You saw I did my little thing.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.956
- So, how much of that
Silas Potter stuff was true?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.042
- Well, the real story is

20:10.125 --> 20:11.919
Silas Potter accidentally
locked himself in his shed.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.795
- Uh, did he die?

20:13.879 --> 20:15.631

and friends 30 years later.

20:17.674 --> 20:18.967
- ALL: Oh.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.385
- He got out of the shed
pretty easily.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.179
Apparently, there's
a loose board in the back.

20:22.262 --> 20:24.431
- Oh, is that how you
got out, Coach?

20:24.514 --> 20:28.018

that old shed anyway.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.128
We really didn't
get anything on tape.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.255
- I know, but I did
a little editing

20:57.339 --> 20:58.674

it truly terrifying.
