06:06.616 --> 06:08.284
I think I see him!

06:23.300 --> 06:24.550
This way!

08:08.864 --> 08:10.656
- Five.
- Oh, great.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.242
So you got an arrow right in your chest.
And you're out 10 melee rounds.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.202
- Oh, no.
- Don't worry about it, Mike. I got resurrection.

08:15.287 --> 08:18.747
I'm already one of the undead.
I can still throw death spells.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.125
I'm just trying to help you out, man.
Don't be so cranky.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.377
How about throwing a spell
over the pizza man?

08:23.461 --> 08:25.754
Where's our pizza, man?

08:25.839 --> 08:28.048
Well, I'm ready now to play.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.176
I'm ready to play now, you guys.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.679
We're in the middle, Elliott.
You can't just join any universe in the middle.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.181
I got him! I got him!

08:36.015 --> 08:37.390
What am I asking for?

08:40.770 --> 08:42.145
- Yeah.
- Mike?

08:42.438 --> 08:44.273
I know. It's not for us,
it's for his mother.

08:45.775 --> 08:46.901
Mike?

08:48.153 --> 08:50.196
You have to ask Steve.
He's game master.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.031
He has absolute power.

08:52.115 --> 08:54.992
- Steve?
- Steve, can I play now?

08:55.619 --> 08:57.203
Go wait for the pizza first.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.954
- Then I'm in?
- Yeah, you're in.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.999
Figure out your strategy.
You're playing after Greg.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.836
Plenty of sausage and pepperonis.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.838
Everything but the little fishies.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.166
Harvey?

09:45.293 --> 09:46.919
Harvey, is that you, boy?

09:53.301 --> 09:54.593
Over here, you guys.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.762
- Stop it.
- Sorry.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.022
Harvey?

10:48.565 --> 10:50.190
All's you can get
is those 40-year-olds.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.859
How do you win this game anyway?

10:51.943 --> 10:54.820
There's no winning.
It's like life. You don't win at life.

10:54.904 --> 10:55.863
Money helps.

10:55.989 --> 10:59.283
- Mom! Mom! There's something out...
- Where's the pizza?

10:59.367 --> 11:02.786
Mom! Mom! There's something out there!
It's in the tool shed.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.705
It threw the ball at me.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.415
Quiet!

11:07.417 --> 11:09.376
Nobody go out there.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.299
Stop. Now, you guys stay right here.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.177
You stay here, Mom.
We'll check it out.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.220
- And put those knives back!
- Come on, Mom!

11:22.531 --> 11:23.640
It's okay, Elliott.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.727
Let's go get the flashlight.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.855
Hold it. Wait a minute.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.525
Creeps. Creepy.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.444
- What exactly did you see?
- It's dark out here.

11:35.904 --> 11:36.988
In there.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.200
It's scary.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.206
There's nothing in here.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.624
The gate's open.

11:49.084 --> 11:50.459
Look at these.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.384
Coyote's come back again, Mom.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.886
Okay, party's over.
Everybody, back inside now.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.388
Get out. Hurry up.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.348
Quick. Hurry up. Come on.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.100
Tyler, give me that knife.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.646
Oh, great. Nice one, Elliott.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.022
It was an accident.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.734
A pizza?
Who said you guys could order a pizza?

12:15.819 --> 12:16.894
Him.

12:18.029 --> 12:20.697
- In the house.
- You geek, man.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.867
- But Mom, it was real. I swear.
- Douche bag.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.994
No douche-bag talk in my house.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.061
Elliott, you're crazy.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.690
Hello.

15:54.329 --> 15:55.412
Hello?

16:47.548 --> 16:49.591
What are you going as for Halloween?

16:49.717 --> 16:51.259
I'm not going to stupid Halloween.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.512
Why don't you go as a goblin?

16:53.596 --> 16:54.805
Shut up.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.932
It's not that we don't believe you, honey.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.101
Well, it was real. I swear.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.188
What are you going as, Gert?

17:03.856 --> 17:06.066
I'm going as a cowgirl.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.484
So what else is new?

17:09.612 --> 17:12.489
- Maybe it was an iguana.
- It was no iguana.

17:12.573 --> 17:13.573
Maybe a...

17:14.075 --> 17:15.075
A...

17:15.159 --> 17:17.618
You know how they say
there are alligators in the sewers?

17:17.744 --> 17:19.621
Alligators in the sewers.

17:19.955 --> 17:23.165
All we're trying to say is,
maybe you just probably imagined it.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.042
I couldn't have imagined it.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.128
Maybe it was a pervert
or a deformed kid or something.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.964
A deformed kid.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.800
Maybe an elf or a leprechaun.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.094
It was nothing like that, penis breath!

17:34.178 --> 17:36.221
Elliott!

17:36.305 --> 17:37.472
Sit down.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.853
Dad would believe me.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.610
Maybe you ought to call your father
and tell him about it.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.406
I can't. He's in Mexico with Sally.

18:05.168 --> 18:07.753
Where's Mexico?

18:11.799 --> 18:13.008
Excuse me.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.598
I'm going to kill you.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.269
If you ever see it again,
whatever it is,

18:24.353 --> 18:26.104
don't touch it. Just call me.

18:26.189 --> 18:28.023
And we'll have somebody come
and take it away.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.484
Like the dogcatcher?

18:30.568 --> 18:35.030
They'll give it a lobotomy
or do experiments on it or something.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.784
It's your turn to do the dishes, fellas.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.411
- I set and cleared.
- I set and cleared.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.872
- I did breakfast.
- I did breakfast.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.376
What's the matter, Mom?

18:52.089 --> 18:53.924
He hates Mexico.

18:54.759 --> 18:59.262
Damn it! Why don't you grow up?
Think how other people feel for a change.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.336
Mom.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.714
Mom. Mom!

20:15.798 --> 20:16.923
Michael.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.264
Michael. Mom.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.791
Okay, you're hot.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.877
I'll be back.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.590
Mary, can I back the car out?

25:50.674 --> 25:52.300
Not one foot past the driveway.

26:50.901 --> 26:54.112
You were outside last night waiting for that thing
to come back, weren't you?

26:55.990 --> 26:58.116
Are you going to live
if I go to work?

27:02.621 --> 27:05.081
Okay. No TV.

27:14.925 --> 27:16.134
Come on.

27:16.218 --> 27:18.303
Mommy, look what Michael did.

27:18.387 --> 27:19.512
This and that...

27:19.596 --> 27:22.724
I see them, Gert.
And when I catch him, I'll catch him.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.479
Come on. Don't be afraid.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.399
It's all right. Come on.

27:32.735 --> 27:43.161
Come on.

27:43.579 --> 27:44.912
Come on.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.248
Come on.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.175
Do you talk?

27:57.801 --> 27:59.761
You know, talk?

28:01.221 --> 28:03.014
Me, human.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.141
Boy.

28:05.517 --> 28:10.396
Elliott.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.024
Elliott.

28:24.661 --> 28:27.455
Coke. See, we drink it.

28:27.539 --> 28:31.209
It's a drink. You know, food?

28:32.211 --> 28:34.545
These are toys.
These are little men.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.923
This is Greedo.

28:37.007 --> 28:40.093
And then, this is Hammerhead.

28:40.177 --> 28:43.554
You see, this is Walrus Man.

28:43.639 --> 28:46.265
And then this is Snaggletooth.

28:47.142 --> 28:50.978
And this is Lando Calrissian. See?

28:51.980 --> 28:54.065
And this is Boba Fett.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.818
Look. They can even have wars.
Look at this.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.741
And look. Fish.

29:04.618 --> 29:09.288
The fish eat the fish food
and the shark eats the fish,

29:10.457 --> 29:12.500
but nobody eats a shark.

29:15.003 --> 29:18.256
See, this is Pez. Candy.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.133
You see, you eat it.

29:20.217 --> 29:23.344
You put the candy in here

29:23.429 --> 29:27.348
and then when you lift up the head,
the candy comes out and you can eat it.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.641
You want some?

29:31.812 --> 29:33.604
This is a peanut.

29:33.689 --> 29:34.939
You eat it.

29:35.023 --> 29:38.693
But you can't eat this one
because this is fake.

29:39.361 --> 29:41.529
This is money. You see?

29:42.114 --> 29:44.699
We put the money in the peanut.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.784
You see? Bank.

29:46.869 --> 29:48.035
You see? And then,

29:50.038 --> 29:51.998
this is a car.

29:52.082 --> 29:54.041
This is what we get around in.

29:54.877 --> 29:56.711
See? A car.

30:00.257 --> 30:02.717
Hey! Hey! Wait a second.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.928
No. You don't eat them.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.097
Are you hungry?

30:09.725 --> 30:11.184
I'm hungry.

30:14.688 --> 30:15.730
Stay.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.361
Stay. I'll be right here.

30:24.072 --> 30:26.574
Okay? I'll be right here.

30:27.534 --> 30:28.510
Harv!

30:29.912 --> 30:31.537
He won't bite.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.333
Come on, Harvey.

30:42.841 --> 30:43.925
He'll like this.

30:51.642 --> 30:55.895
This.

31:23.799 --> 31:25.132
Are you okay?

31:28.804 --> 31:30.429
Too much excitement, huh?

31:31.348 --> 31:32.515
Want a Coke?

31:38.397 --> 31:42.692
<i>There are so many people to see</i>

31:42.776 --> 31:47.655
<i>So many people you can check up on
and add to your collection</i>

31:47.739 --> 31:50.074
<i>But they keep you hanging on</i>

31:50.158 --> 31:53.077
Nothing but health shit.

31:53.161 --> 31:57.665
<i>Add to your collection
But they keep you hanging on</i>

32:03.380 --> 32:04.672
Mike, Mike, come in.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.674
- How you feeling, faker?
- I'm feeling fine.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.259
Look, I got something really important...

32:08.343 --> 32:11.596
Tyler said he got 69,000
on <i>Asteroids</i> yesterday.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.432
- But he pulled the plug.
- Look, remember the goblin?

32:15.058 --> 32:16.434
You're so lame, Elliott.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.477
Come on, Michael.
He came back.

32:19.813 --> 32:23.482
He came back?

32:23.567 --> 32:24.859
Oh, my God!

32:24.943 --> 32:26.652
One thing.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.447
I have absolute power.

32:29.531 --> 32:30.906
Say it.

32:30.991 --> 32:33.909
- Say it!
- What have you got? Is it the coyote?

32:33.994 --> 32:36.078
No. Look...

32:37.998 --> 32:41.042
Okay. Now, swear it.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.586
The most excellent promise you can make.

32:43.670 --> 32:47.298
Swear as my only brother on our lives.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.258
Okay, don't get so heavy. I swear.

32:49.743 --> 32:52.386
Okay. Stand over there.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.805
And you'd better take off
your shoulder pads.

32:54.931 --> 32:58.851
- What?
- You might scare him. And close your eyes.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.437
Don't push it, Elliott.

33:01.521 --> 33:04.440
I'm not coming out there
until your eyes are closed.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.567
Okay. They're closed.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.819
Mom is going to kill you.

33:11.573 --> 33:14.950
Okay. Swear it one more time.

33:15.077 --> 33:18.412
- I have absolute power.
- You have absolute power. Yes.

33:29.508 --> 33:32.510
Elliott! Look what I made for you!

33:38.350 --> 33:40.935
Stop! Stop!

33:41.895 --> 33:42.937
Stop!

33:49.194 --> 33:50.611
Kids, I'm home!

33:50.904 --> 33:51.987
Guys?

33:52.072 --> 33:55.032
- In the closet, fast.
- Anybody up there, kids?

33:58.453 --> 33:59.870
Anybody home?

33:59.955 --> 34:02.540
Hi, honey, how are you feel...

34:02.624 --> 34:04.500
What happened in here?

34:05.794 --> 34:07.837
Oh, you mean my room.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.172
This is no room.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.717
This is an accident.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.844
I was reorganizing.

34:16.346 --> 34:17.804
I can see that.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.224
Put those shelves back on the wall, dear.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.143
Let's get the toys off the floor.

34:22.226 --> 34:25.521
Make your bed since you are not using it.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.898
Well, you're feeling better, I see.

34:27.983 --> 34:31.569
Will you guys keep an eye on Gertie for me
while I take a shower?

34:31.652 --> 34:32.902
Absolutely.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.031
Bye, Mom.

34:46.877 --> 34:47.960
Elliott...

34:48.587 --> 34:49.920
I'm keeping him.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.341
What is it?

34:55.427 --> 34:57.470
He won't hurt you, Gertie.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.681
He won't hurt you, Gertie.

35:01.475 --> 35:03.350
We're not going to hurt you.

35:04.519 --> 35:06.479
Is he a boy or a girl?

35:06.938 --> 35:08.314
He's a boy.

35:11.526 --> 35:14.036
Was he wearing any clothes?

35:14.613 --> 35:15.863
No.

35:16.573 --> 35:20.743
But, look, you can't tell.
Not even Mom.

35:21.369 --> 35:22.536
Why not?

35:22.704 --> 35:25.664
Because grownups can't see him.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.460
Only little kids can see him.

35:29.544 --> 35:31.086
Give me a break.

35:31.171 --> 35:34.924
Well, do you know what's going to happen

35:35.008 --> 35:36.383
if you do tell?

35:39.721 --> 35:41.222
Do it, Mike. We have to.

35:41.306 --> 35:42.973
No, please!

35:43.058 --> 35:45.476
No! I'll do anything, please!

35:45.560 --> 35:48.354
Gertie, help me! No, please!

35:48.563 --> 35:49.730
Give it!

35:50.232 --> 35:51.565
- Promise?
- Yes.

35:52.734 --> 35:54.318
Do you promise?

37:04.139 --> 37:05.681
What are you doing, Gert?

37:06.141 --> 37:08.642
I'm going to play in Elliott's room.

37:10.103 --> 37:12.396
Okay. Don't let him torture you.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.064
I won't, Mary.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.364
Hello?

37:22.449 --> 37:23.949
Jerry! Jerry!

37:29.956 --> 37:31.999
Come on, come on. Hurry up.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.628
Don't be pushy, pushy.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.925
A plant for you.

37:41.843 --> 37:44.595
Maybe he's some animal
that wasn't supposed to live.

37:45.013 --> 37:46.722
You know, like those rabbits
we saw that time.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.432
- Don't be lame.
- Green, orange, red.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.267
Could be a monkey or an orangutan...

37:50.352 --> 37:51.936
A bald monkey?

37:52.020 --> 37:54.855
Is he a pig?
He sure eats like one.

37:55.565 --> 37:57.358
You could make faces.

37:58.026 --> 38:02.988
And make them mean and happy
and make them get sharp teeth.

38:03.073 --> 38:04.573
We are here.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.327
- We're here.
- No, use this.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.412
You could make all sorts of things.

38:10.497 --> 38:12.665
Okay. We're here.

38:13.375 --> 38:14.541
We are here.

38:14.668 --> 38:16.377
Where are you from?

38:29.182 --> 38:31.016
I don't like his feet.

38:31.101 --> 38:33.310
They're only feet,
you little twerp.

38:33.395 --> 38:35.729
He's trying to tell us something.

38:45.573 --> 38:46.657
Earth.

38:48.243 --> 38:51.370
Home.

38:52.247 --> 38:53.330
Home.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.244
What's he doing?

39:33.580 --> 39:35.080
What's happening?

39:48.261 --> 39:49.303
Elliott.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.140
Oh, no.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.322
Elliott, what is it?

40:08.406 --> 40:10.365
I don't know. Something scary.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.055
- Got a pulse?
- No, boss.

40:38.228 --> 40:39.937
Hold it. We got it right here.

40:41.523 --> 40:42.648
Follow him.

40:45.527 --> 40:47.027
You think this house?

41:18.059 --> 41:19.309
Did you explain school to him?

41:19.394 --> 41:21.812
How do you explain school
to higher intelligence?

41:21.896 --> 41:23.939
Maybe he's not that smart.
Maybe he's a worker bee

41:24.065 --> 41:26.316
- who only knows how to push buttons.
- He's too smart.

41:26.401 --> 41:28.986
Okay, I just hope
we don't wake up on Mars or something,

41:29.070 --> 41:31.655
surrounded by millions
of little squashy guys.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.122
Hi, Elliott.

41:40.248 --> 41:42.583
- Hey, Elliott, where's your goblin?
- Shut up.

41:42.667 --> 41:43.959
Did he come back?

41:44.252 --> 41:45.586
Well, did he?

41:46.337 --> 41:48.130
Yeah, he came back.

41:48.214 --> 41:50.507
But he's not a goblin.
He's a spaceman.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.969
As in extraterrestrial.

41:54.095 --> 41:57.639
Where's he from? Uranus?
Get it? Your anus?

41:57.724 --> 42:00.350
- He doesn't get it, Ty.
- Get it? Your anus?

42:00.435 --> 42:02.519
- He doesn't get it.
- You're so immature.

42:02.604 --> 42:04.188
And you're a sine supremus.

42:04.272 --> 42:07.691
- Zero charisma.
- Sine supremus.

42:07.775 --> 42:09.067
Shut up, Greg!

42:09.152 --> 42:11.195
- Sine supremus.
- Zero charisma!

42:11.279 --> 42:12.446
You wimp.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.249
Let's go.

42:27.962 --> 42:30.547
Come on. Get in the car.
We're gonna be late.

43:14.133 --> 43:18.595
Okay, boys and girls,
today we will be doing the actual frog dissection

43:18.680 --> 43:21.139
for which we've been preparing.

43:21.683 --> 43:26.228
And you will find many similarities.

43:32.652 --> 43:37.197
As you get into the dissection,
you will discover that the anatomy...

44:08.062 --> 44:11.606
The scalpel is very sharp.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.569
Use discretion when you are cutting.

44:15.653 --> 44:20.073
There will be very little blood.
There may be a few body fluids.

45:11.959 --> 45:14.836
As we get started with the dissection...

45:14.962 --> 45:20.217
remember that the things
that you are writing down...

45:31.813 --> 45:35.732
One thing that you should be looking for
during the dissection

45:35.817 --> 45:39.486
is to locate the heart
and notice that it is still beating.

45:43.574 --> 45:46.368
I'm going to once more
emphasize the similarities

45:46.452 --> 45:48.995
of those things which we see in the...

45:53.626 --> 45:56.002
Similarities with human anatomy...

45:57.380 --> 45:59.005
First of all, here's the heart...

46:05.847 --> 46:11.184
The intestines will be going through
their peristaltic action.

46:12.854 --> 46:15.939
<i>X-W-V-U.</i>

46:16.023 --> 46:18.817
<i>A-F-P.</i>

46:18.901 --> 46:22.863
<i>That is incorrect.
The correct spelling of nuisance is</i>

46:22.947 --> 46:28.201
<i>N-U-I-S-A-N-C-E.</i>

46:35.042 --> 46:36.084
<i>They're pulling us up.</i>

46:42.425 --> 46:46.720
Class, these are the cotton balls
with the chloroform.

46:46.804 --> 46:51.725
And as soon as I get them all in,
be sure and put the lid on right away.

46:52.309 --> 46:53.727
That's it.

46:53.811 --> 46:56.229
That will start them going to sleep.

47:00.193 --> 47:03.320
And they won't feel anything.
They won't be hurt.

47:05.740 --> 47:07.365
It'll take a little while.

47:08.201 --> 47:11.036
If you don't want to watch them,
you don't have to.

47:30.473 --> 47:31.890
Say hi.

47:33.226 --> 47:34.518
Can you talk?

47:35.228 --> 47:36.645
Can you say hi?

48:01.963 --> 48:03.004
<i>Hello.</i>

48:03.089 --> 48:04.589
<i>Uncle Ralph!</i>

48:04.674 --> 48:07.509
<i>It's Uncle Ralph,
long distance from California!</i>

48:07.593 --> 48:10.262
<i>I'll talk fast.
This call must be expensive.</i>

48:10.346 --> 48:13.598
<i>No, no, no, no. If I call anytime
on Saturday without an operator,</i>

48:13.683 --> 48:16.351
<i>I can talk for five minutes
for 85 cents plus tax.</i>

48:16.435 --> 48:18.979
<i>If I talk less, I pay less.</i>

48:19.063 --> 48:20.772
<i>Let me talk to that little fella.</i>

48:20.856 --> 48:22.983
<i>Lou, it's Uncle Ralph.</i>

48:23.067 --> 48:24.359
<i>Hello, Uncle Ralph.</i>

48:45.590 --> 48:46.923
Save him.

48:54.265 --> 48:57.350
Run for your life!
Back to the river! Back to the forest!

48:57.435 --> 49:00.854
Run! I want to save you!

49:00.938 --> 49:02.939
Let's get out of here!

49:05.818 --> 49:07.235
Get out!

49:07.320 --> 49:09.029
I got to let him go!

49:16.370 --> 49:18.163
You've got to save him!

49:43.356 --> 49:44.939
Let me handle this!

49:45.024 --> 49:48.652
Class. Let me handle this!
I can handle this.

49:48.736 --> 49:49.986
Let me get this.

50:43.916 --> 50:45.917
<i>Grandpa, what's wrong?</i>

50:46.377 --> 50:49.295
<i>I'm afraid Betsy Sue
isn't going to run tomorrow.</i>

50:49.630 --> 50:52.215
<i>Oh, no. Is it anything serious?</i>

50:52.299 --> 50:54.926
Harvey, I'm home.
Come here, boy.

51:06.689 --> 51:08.022
Here he is.

51:08.107 --> 51:09.733
Here's who?

51:09.817 --> 51:13.069
The man from the moon,
but I think you've killed him already.

51:13.154 --> 51:15.822
Honey, just as soon
as I unload the stuff, okay?

51:22.163 --> 51:23.413
Med-bugs.

51:25.458 --> 51:27.542
I want you to meet somebody.

51:27.626 --> 51:29.878
This stuff has gone up
so much in one week.

51:29.962 --> 51:31.421
I want you to meet somebody.

51:31.505 --> 51:35.133
Okay, honey, as soon as I finish
putting all this stuff away, all right?

51:46.020 --> 51:48.438
Stupid ragù.
I knew it wouldn't come out.

51:51.150 --> 51:52.525
- <i>"B."</i>
- "B."

51:52.818 --> 51:54.360
What's with this?

51:57.907 --> 51:59.073
Hello.

52:00.659 --> 52:02.118
Yeah, this is she.

52:02.536 --> 52:03.745
"Basket."

52:03.913 --> 52:04.954
"Bandit."

52:05.039 --> 52:06.164
"Ball."

52:06.582 --> 52:08.875
"Basket. Bandit. Ball."

52:09.835 --> 52:11.461
"Bugs."

52:11.545 --> 52:12.670
"Bananas."

52:13.923 --> 52:15.465
Intoxicated?

52:20.638 --> 52:22.639
You sure you have the right Elliott?

52:23.098 --> 52:24.766
"B. B."

52:25.810 --> 52:27.685
- "Biscuits."
- B.

52:29.146 --> 52:30.355
<i>But "B" is for boy...</i>

52:30.439 --> 52:31.731
B.

52:31.816 --> 52:33.691
<i>with a baseball and bat.</i>

52:35.194 --> 52:36.653
You said "B."

52:37.321 --> 52:38.404
B.

52:39.073 --> 52:41.241
You said "B." Good.

52:42.451 --> 52:43.910
B.

52:45.037 --> 52:46.579
Good.

52:46.956 --> 52:49.082
Okay, I'll be right down. Thank you.

52:51.710 --> 52:54.170
Gertie, I have to go pick up Elliott.

52:54.255 --> 52:57.257
- Will you be a good girl...
- Mommy, he can talk.

52:57.341 --> 53:01.094
Of course he can talk. I'll be right back
in 10 minutes. Stay there.

53:01.178 --> 53:06.140
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
little Grover here will demonstrate</i>

53:06.225 --> 53:09.352
<i>by chinning himself two times.</i>

53:09.436 --> 53:10.895
- <i>Two times?</i>
- <i>Two times.</i>

53:10.980 --> 53:13.147
- <i>Can I start?</i>
- <i>Okay. Go ahead.</i>

53:13.232 --> 53:14.732
<i>Okay. Here we go.</i>

53:14.817 --> 53:16.109
Phone.

53:16.694 --> 53:17.902
Phone.

53:18.070 --> 53:19.112
Phone.

53:19.947 --> 53:22.615
Phone.

53:26.287 --> 53:28.329
You want to call somebody?

53:29.790 --> 53:31.708
I am not paying for frogs.

53:32.376 --> 53:34.794
Be good. Be good.

53:36.088 --> 53:37.797
Stay here. Stay.

53:38.340 --> 53:41.426
And don't tell anybody. Nobody.

53:42.469 --> 53:44.429
Be good. Be good.

53:47.057 --> 53:48.141
Move.

53:53.564 --> 53:55.398
Oh, God!

53:55.482 --> 53:57.358
- Elliott.
- What?

53:57.443 --> 53:58.776
Elliott.

53:59.069 --> 54:00.403
Elliott.

54:00.487 --> 54:04.240
I taught him how to talk now.
He can talk now.

54:04.325 --> 54:05.366
Elliott!

54:05.451 --> 54:07.702
Look what he brought up here
all by himself.

54:07.828 --> 54:08.786
Elliott.

54:08.871 --> 54:10.246
What's he need this stuff for?

54:10.331 --> 54:12.040
Elliott. Elliott.

54:13.375 --> 54:14.626
E.T. Can you say that?

54:14.710 --> 54:16.419
Can you say E.T.?

54:16.795 --> 54:19.756
E.T.

54:21.175 --> 54:23.217
E.T. E.T. E.T.

54:23.302 --> 54:24.594
Be good.

54:24.678 --> 54:26.888
"Be good." I taught him that, too.

54:26.972 --> 54:28.765
You should give him his dignity.

54:28.849 --> 54:31.351
This is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever seen!

54:32.144 --> 54:33.770
Phone.

54:35.230 --> 54:36.773
Phone?

54:37.024 --> 54:40.318
He said "phone"?

54:40.402 --> 54:43.780
Can't you understand English?
He said "phone."

54:47.785 --> 54:49.035
Home.

54:49.495 --> 54:52.205
You're right. That's E.T.'s home.

55:00.547 --> 55:02.465
E.T.

55:03.175 --> 55:05.301
Home, phone.

55:10.391 --> 55:12.558
E.T. phone home.

55:14.269 --> 55:18.106
E.T. phone home.
E.T. phone home.

55:18.190 --> 55:19.899
He wants to call somebody.

55:25.447 --> 55:29.993
- What's all this shit?
- E.T. phone home.

55:30.077 --> 55:31.869
Oh, my God, he's talking now.

55:32.913 --> 55:34.205
Home.

55:35.416 --> 55:37.250
E.T. phone home?

55:37.334 --> 55:40.920
E.T. phone home.

55:44.591 --> 55:46.009
And they'll come?

55:46.093 --> 55:47.635
Come.

55:48.262 --> 55:52.598
Home.

55:54.601 --> 55:56.602
- <i>Come on. I promise, Mom.</i>
- <i>What book?</i>

55:56.687 --> 55:58.938
- <i>Any one you want.</i>
- Spiderman...

55:59.231 --> 56:01.357
<i>I'm fine.
We'll just put a smile on our face</i>

56:01.442 --> 56:04.110
<i>and try to get through the evening.
That's all I want to do.</i>

56:04.903 --> 56:06.946
<i>We can't ask Cathy
to go trick-or-treating</i>

56:07.072 --> 56:09.282
<i>in the same old sheet
she wore last year.</i>

56:09.450 --> 56:13.202
<i>Now I wish I would've listened in science.</i>

56:13.620 --> 56:14.787
<i>Think, Michael.</i>

56:14.913 --> 56:16.706
I guess we should just grab anything that

56:16.790 --> 56:18.458
looks like he could make a machine out of.

56:18.792 --> 56:21.044
What would make a radar?

56:21.128 --> 56:23.713
How the hell do I know?
You're the genius here.

56:23.797 --> 56:26.466
You have absolute power, remember?

56:26.550 --> 56:28.718
"I found him. He belongs to me."

56:42.566 --> 56:43.983
You know, Elliott,

56:45.319 --> 56:49.030
- he doesn't look too good anymore.
- Don't say that! We're fine!

56:49.782 --> 56:51.491
What's all this "we" stuff?

56:52.242 --> 56:54.368
<i>You say "we" all the time now.</i>

56:54.495 --> 56:57.080
- <i>Really, Elliott, I think he may be getting sick.</i>
- <i>Look, he's fine.</i>

56:57.164 --> 57:00.583
<i>Okay, okay. Forget I mentioned it.</i>

57:01.418 --> 57:02.543
<i>Grab that Fuzzbuster.</i>

57:11.428 --> 57:12.845
Dad's shirt.

57:16.934 --> 57:20.019
Remember when he used to take us out
to the ball games

57:20.104 --> 57:23.523
and take us to the movies,
and we'd have popcorn fights?

57:24.775 --> 57:27.693
- <i>We'll do that again, Elliott.</i>
- <i>Sure.</i>

57:36.370 --> 57:37.745
Old Spice.

57:38.330 --> 57:39.580
Sea Breeze.

57:45.462 --> 57:48.965
"Peter says, 'The redskins were defeated?

57:49.049 --> 57:51.592
"'Wendy and the boys captured by the pirates?

57:51.677 --> 57:54.053
"'I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her.'

57:54.513 --> 57:56.639
"He leaps, first at his dagger...

57:56.723 --> 57:58.975
"then at his grindstone to sharpen it.

57:59.059 --> 58:02.895
"Tink alights near the shell,
and rings out a warning cry.

58:02.980 --> 58:04.981
"'Oh, that is just my medicine.'

58:05.065 --> 58:07.942
"She says, 'Poisoned?

58:08.026 --> 58:10.153
"'Who could've poisoned it? '

58:10.237 --> 58:14.991
"'I promised Wendy to take it and I will,
as soon as I have sharpened my dagger.'

58:15.075 --> 58:17.285
"Tink, who sees its red color

58:17.369 --> 58:19.829
"and remembers the red of the pirate's eye

58:19.913 --> 58:23.916
"nobly swallows the draft
as Peter's hand is reaching for it.

58:24.751 --> 58:28.921
"'Why, Tink, you have drunk my medicine.'

58:29.006 --> 58:33.759
"She flutters strangely about the room,
answering him now in a very thin tinkle."

58:52.654 --> 58:57.241
"She says she thinks
she could get well again

58:57.326 --> 58:59.327
"if children believed in fairies.

58:59.411 --> 59:01.871
"Do you believe in fairies?
Say quick that you believe."

59:01.955 --> 59:03.122
I do! I do! I do!

59:03.207 --> 59:05.333
"If you believe, clap your hands.

59:05.959 --> 59:08.586
"Many clap, some don't, a few hiss.

59:16.303 --> 59:19.972
"But Tink is saved. 'Thank you.

59:20.933 --> 59:23.809
"'Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

59:23.894 --> 59:25.811
"'And now to rescue Wendy."'

59:26.647 --> 59:28.940
Can you read it to me again?

59:32.486 --> 59:33.819
"Peter says..."

59:54.049 --> 59:55.716
He's putting it together now.

59:56.510 --> 59:59.470
- I told you he was smart.
- I'm worried, Elliott.

59:59.554 --> 01:00:01.222
He could blow up the whole house.

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:02.556
He knows what he's doing.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.226
Listen to how he's breathing.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.478
It's going to work.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:09.563
What's he feeling now?

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:12.024
He's feeling everything.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:38.801
Now, you're going as a ghost.
You promised.

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:42.763
I'm only pretending
I'm going as a cowgirl.

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:46.267
Okay. Now, you know the plans by heart,
don't you?

01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:48.019
Meet you at the lookout.

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:51.147
At the lookout.
I'm not stupid, you know.

01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:53.190
Listen, buster.
You won't get four blocks

01:00:53.275 --> 01:00:54.734
in this neighborhood dressed like that.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.110
- Please.
- No, and that is final.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.695
You are not going as a terrorist.

01:00:57.779 --> 01:00:58.904
But all the guys are!

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:00.489
I'm not stupid, you know.

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:10.583
Ready?

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:12.043
Ready.

01:01:29.478 --> 01:01:31.645
- Wait, Mom. Don't look.
- Okay.

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:39.362
Okay, Mom. You can look now.

01:01:44.326 --> 01:01:46.069
Oh, that's great!

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:49.455
Stay here.

01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:04.553
Stop that! No! Don't!

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:08.266
No. It's a fake knife.
It's a fake.

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:10.684
Okay.

01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:17.817
All right.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:20.986
You look great!

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:22.988
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:24.198
Thank you.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:35.793
Be back one hour after sundown.
No later.

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:42.800
Bye.

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:48.013
Gertie, come here. Come on.

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:19.378
Trick or treat?

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:46.780
Home. Home.

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:52.036
Home. Home. Home.
Home. Home. Home.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:57.333
Be back one hour after sunset.
No later.

01:03:57.959 --> 01:04:00.336
I'll try as fast as I can, Mike.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.421
You got to cover me.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:08.052
Well, come on. Help me.

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:11.805
We'll be waiting for you, Elliott.
So come back for sure.

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:41.126
It's too bumpy.
We'll have to walk from here!

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:43.295
E.T.!

01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:57.309
Not so high! Not so high!

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:37.683
Don't crash, please.

01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:04.812
I really can't believe you did this.

01:07:11.152 --> 01:07:13.529
Your father's going to hear
about this one.

01:07:21.329 --> 01:07:22.830
Mexico.

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:49.249
E.T., it's working.

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:52.294
It's working!

01:08:52.504 --> 01:08:53.670
Home.

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:56.548
You did it!

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:58.926
It's working!

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:00.886
Home.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:05.599
E.T., it's working!

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:42.970
Check the door on the left.

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:51.144
We have to go now, E.T.

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:53.772
We're so late already.

01:10:01.281 --> 01:10:03.615
We have to go home now, E.T.

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:12.040
You should give them some time.

01:10:24.429 --> 01:10:25.971
You could be happy here.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.098
I could take care of you.

01:10:28.308 --> 01:10:30.309
I wouldn't let anybody hurt you.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.603
We could grow up together, E.T.

01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:40.156
Home.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.608
E.T.?

01:12:05.113 --> 01:12:06.238
E.T.?

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:15.747
How was he dressed when last seen?

01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:18.250
He was dressed as a

01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:20.836
hunchback.

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:23.255
Hunchback.

01:12:24.215 --> 01:12:26.717
Is there anything to indicate
that he might have run away?

01:12:26.801 --> 01:12:29.594
Any family problems or recent arguments?

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:35.225
My husband and I just separated recently

01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:39.771
and it hasn't been easy
on the children, but...

01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:42.441
My father's in Mexico.

01:12:49.073 --> 01:12:50.615
But run away, I...

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:53.368
Where would he have gone?

01:12:53.536 --> 01:12:54.870
Elliott.

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:56.705
Oh, Elliott!

01:12:58.124 --> 01:13:00.459
Don't ever do this again, Elliott!

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:04.629
Oh, my. You're so hot.

01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:08.175
Run up and draw him a bath.
Quick, Gert.

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.178
Sorry I yelled at you.

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:16.975
Thanks very much for all your trouble.

01:13:17.518 --> 01:13:18.977
Is he here?

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:24.357
- You've got to find him, Mike.
- Where is he?

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:27.069
In the forest.

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:29.237
At the bald spot.

01:13:30.281 --> 01:13:31.990
You've got to find him.

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:24.209
E.T.!

01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:32.717
E.T.!

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:13.258
No!

01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:14.459
No!

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:47.584
Mom, would you come with me?

01:15:48.252 --> 01:15:49.669
What is it?

01:15:49.754 --> 01:15:51.504
Mary, just come with me.

01:15:51.839 --> 01:15:53.465
Michael, what?

01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:57.010
- Mom, remember the goblin?
- Michael, what are you talking about?

01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:59.512
Just swear the most excellent promise
you can make.

01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:00.972
Michael.

01:16:07.438 --> 01:16:08.772
That's terrific.

01:16:15.279 --> 01:16:17.364
Mom.

01:16:22.787 --> 01:16:23.995
We're sick.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:28.708
I think we're dying.

01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:34.839
- Michael.
- Mom, it's okay.

01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:37.926
Downstairs.

01:16:38.344 --> 01:16:40.804
He's not going to hurt you, Mom.

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:42.555
He's not gonna hurt you.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.140
Michael, get her downstairs.

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:46.101
It's the man from the moon.

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:48.812
The man from the moon!

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:54.859
You don't know him!
You don't know him!

01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:01.866
We can't leave him alone.

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:42.907
This is my home!

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:36.294
Home.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:20.713
<i>The collagen unit,
report to the blue level immediately.</i>

01:19:53.873 --> 01:19:55.373
Does he sleep at night?

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:56.624
I don't know. I don't know.

01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:58.334
What's the matter with Elliott?

01:19:59.336 --> 01:20:02.297
- Have you noticed any surface sweating?
- No.

01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:05.300
- Has it lost any hair?
- He never had any hair.

01:20:05.426 --> 01:20:07.260
- Are the children all right?
- Yes.

01:20:07.344 --> 01:20:10.722
Did it ever build anything
or write anything down?

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:11.890
Uh... No.

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:15.643
Would you say it has the ability
to manipulate its own environment?

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:19.439
He's smart.
He communicates through Elliott.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:22.192
Elliott thinks its thoughts.

01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:26.279
No. Elliott feels his feelings.

01:20:30.451 --> 01:20:33.286
We've identified his primary carrier protein
by electrophoresis.

01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:34.537
It's definitely not albumin.

01:20:34.622 --> 01:20:37.832
Testing shows no deficit.
Some F&F. HTS test...

01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:39.918
EEG analysis shows complete coherence

01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:42.670
and synchronization of brainwave activity
between both subjects.

01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:44.005
Skin biopsy reveals 9 millimeters of...

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:45.298
<i>Read isotonic.</i>

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:48.009
<i>Nitrates. 255 million equivalent.</i>

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:50.094
Better do IV and oral contrast.

01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:53.473
If there's no response,
let's move to hypertonic saline.

01:20:53.766 --> 01:20:55.099
We have meta-starch available.

01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:56.559
Cut five per kilo.

01:20:56.644 --> 01:20:57.727
CVP line could help.

01:20:57.811 --> 01:21:00.188
I think you get more information
with this one gain.

01:21:01.899 --> 01:21:06.402
You have no right to do this.
You're scaring him.

01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:08.947
You're scaring him!

01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:10.240
Respiratory rate, 12.

01:21:10.324 --> 01:21:12.742
Good air entry but decreased
tidal volume on the boy.

01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:16.579
Put him on O2 five liters by nasal cannula
and draw blood gas in 20 minutes.

01:21:16.664 --> 01:21:18.706
Temperature's dropped from 20
to 17 degrees centigrade.

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:20.333
Get a hypothermia blanket...

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:22.460
Please leave him alone.

01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:26.631
Can you leave him alone?
I can take care of him.

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:29.259
Get a Doppler-scope in here and set me up
for a 2D cardiac echo.

01:21:29.343 --> 01:21:31.803
Skin is cool and diaphoretic.

01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:34.639
He's not refusing at all.
He needs inotropic support.

01:21:34.807 --> 01:21:38.268
PH is down to 7.03.
He's got metabolic acidosis.

01:21:39.478 --> 01:21:40.937
It could be sepsis.

01:21:41.313 --> 01:21:43.022
We've drawn two sets of blood cultures.

01:21:43.107 --> 01:21:46.317
He needs broad-spectrum coverage.
How about amp, gen, flagyl?

01:21:54.118 --> 01:21:55.493
Elliott.

01:21:58.163 --> 01:21:59.998
I've been to the forest.

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:02.875
He shouldn't talk now.

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:05.670
Well, he has to talk now, Major.

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:12.302
Elliott, that machine, what does it do?

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:16.472
The communicator?

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:21.019
Is it still working?

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:22.854
It's doing something.

01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:25.607
What?

01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:28.610
I really shouldn't tell.

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.696
He came to me.

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:34.032
He came to me.

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:38.328
Elliott, he came to me, too.

01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:43.041
I've been wishing for this
since I was 10 years old.

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:45.668
I don't want him to die.

01:22:46.587 --> 01:22:49.130
What can we do that
we're not already doing?

01:22:50.174 --> 01:22:52.884
He needs to go home.

01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:56.721
He's calling his people

01:22:58.349 --> 01:23:00.975
and I don't know where they are.

01:23:02.269 --> 01:23:04.312
He needs to go home.

01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:09.442
Elliott, I don't think
that he was left here intentionally.

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:15.448
But his being here is a miracle, Elliott.

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.076
It's a miracle.

01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:22.580
And you did the best
that anybody could do.

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:28.127
I'm glad he met you first.

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:39.681
- He's got DNA.
- Incredible.

01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:41.933
- He's got DNA.
- What?

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:44.310
He doesn't have four nucleotides like we do.
He has six.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:47.063
I've got de-synchronization
of the two brainwave activities.

01:23:47.147 --> 01:23:48.356
What are they?

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:51.442
E.T.!

01:23:51.568 --> 01:23:54.570
The boy's condition is stabilizing.
His blood pressure's coming back up.

01:23:55.948 --> 01:23:57.740
E.T.

01:23:59.118 --> 01:24:00.660
Elliott.

01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:03.287
- He's speaking.
- He's talking.

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:06.874
E.T., stay with me.

01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:10.336
Please.

01:24:10.421 --> 01:24:12.171
Stay.

01:24:12.297 --> 01:24:13.548
Together.

01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:17.135
I'll be right here.

01:24:17.845 --> 01:24:19.804
I'll be right here.

01:24:22.474 --> 01:24:24.726
Stay.

01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:28.896
Elliott.

01:24:30.023 --> 01:24:43.619
Stay.

01:24:43.704 --> 01:24:46.998
The creature's pressure is bottoming out.
His complexes are slow and widening.

01:24:47.166 --> 01:24:48.958
How's the boy?

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:52.170
He's converting back to normal
sinus rhythm.

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:55.173
- They're separating.
- Yes, definitely separating.

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:56.674
Boy and creature are separating.

01:24:56.717 --> 01:25:00.386
- What does that mean?
- The boy's coming back. We're losing E.T.

01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:03.473
E.T., answer me, please.

01:25:04.141 --> 01:25:06.309
- Everything is going to be fine.
- Please.

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:08.269
Just relax.

01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:16.921
No!

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:18.714
E.T., don't go!

01:26:18.841 --> 01:26:21.592
- No blood pressure.
- He's got no pulse or respiration.

01:26:23.762 --> 01:26:25.763
We can't get a pulse or blood pressure
on the creature.

01:26:25.848 --> 01:26:27.723
It doesn't look like he's breathing.

01:26:31.478 --> 01:26:35.022
Leave him alone!
You're killing him!

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:36.607
Leave him alone!

01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:38.484
Let's move it!

01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:40.653
Get the boy out of here.
Get him away.

01:26:40.737 --> 01:26:44.532
Stop it! You're killing him!
You're killing him!

01:26:46.869 --> 01:26:49.829
You're killing him!
You're killing him!

01:26:50.205 --> 01:26:52.582
You're killing him!
He came to me!

01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:55.626
Any pulses? Any pulses?

01:26:55.711 --> 01:26:57.378
- Okay, let's go.
- He came to me!

01:27:03.135 --> 01:27:04.844
Minimal breath sounds.

01:27:06.513 --> 01:27:08.931
Calm down. Calm down. Calm...

01:27:10.475 --> 01:27:14.020
Let's try some bretylium.
Can we have some bretylium, please?

01:27:15.606 --> 01:27:16.689
Getting a pulse?

01:27:16.815 --> 01:27:18.983
Compressed air.
Compressed air's fine.

01:27:20.027 --> 01:27:21.027
Thank you.

01:27:21.695 --> 01:27:22.778
All IV push.

01:27:22.863 --> 01:27:24.113
He's not ventilating.

01:27:25.324 --> 01:27:27.241
His pupils are fixed and dilated.

01:27:27.326 --> 01:27:28.367
How about some more drugs?

01:27:28.452 --> 01:27:29.493
Quiet.

01:27:29.578 --> 01:27:31.245
Defibrillate him.

01:27:35.042 --> 01:27:37.293
- Everybody, stand clear.
- Clear.

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:39.128
We're losing him.

01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:40.421
One more time.

01:27:42.466 --> 01:27:43.841
Quiet.

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:45.843
- It's still v-fib.
- Okay, let's go.

01:27:45.928 --> 01:27:47.345
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

01:27:49.973 --> 01:27:51.182
Quiet.

01:27:54.978 --> 01:27:56.270
Elliott?

01:27:58.023 --> 01:27:59.190
Mom.

01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:10.952
Try calcium.

01:28:11.036 --> 01:28:12.954
He needs some calcium in his body.

01:28:13.038 --> 01:28:14.664
Let's continue CPR, please.

01:28:30.263 --> 01:28:32.223
Would you people stand back?

01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:39.355
Something's happening.

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:42.483
- Oh, they're going to die.
- Shut up, Greg.

01:28:42.567 --> 01:28:44.610
Something is definitely happening.

01:28:44.736 --> 01:28:46.946
- Anybody have any ideas?
- EKG's flat.

01:28:47.072 --> 01:28:49.615
- EKG's flat.
- Okay, I'm going to call it.

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:53.327
- I think he's dead.
- No. I don't know.

01:28:53.412 --> 01:28:55.496
All right. I'm calling it.
What time do you have?

01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:56.747
1536.

01:28:56.915 --> 01:28:59.166
15 hours, 36 minutes.

01:28:59.918 --> 01:29:01.252
Okay.

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.754
Let's pack him in ice.

01:29:04.589 --> 01:29:06.257
Let's leave.

01:30:12.741 --> 01:30:14.283
Is he dead, Mama?

01:30:15.494 --> 01:30:17.161
I think so, sweetheart.

01:30:17.788 --> 01:30:19.997
Can we wish for him to come back?

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:23.042
Yeah.

01:30:23.627 --> 01:30:25.044
I wish.

01:30:26.004 --> 01:30:27.505
I wish, too.

01:30:37.099 --> 01:30:40.518
Come on, Gert.
We'll wait for Elliott in the front room.

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:47.566
Cardiac arrest was terminated
at 1500 hours and 36 minutes.

01:30:47.651 --> 01:30:53.280
He received intravenous lidocaine,
intravenous epinephrine, a lidocaine drip,

01:30:53.365 --> 01:30:57.701
2.7% sodium-chloride solution,
catheters from the "A" line.

01:30:57.869 --> 01:31:02.248
And the intravenous line
should be sent for culture.

01:31:02.332 --> 01:31:08.295
He was monitored with
an EEG and an EKG.

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:10.214
He was defibrillated...

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:12.550
They're going to have
to take him away now.

01:31:12.634 --> 01:31:15.010
They're just gonna cut him all up.

01:31:17.556 --> 01:31:20.641
Would you like to spend some time
alone with him?

01:31:36.158 --> 01:31:38.909
Could we all step out for a minute, please?

01:32:33.423 --> 01:32:35.716
Look at what they've done to you.

01:32:38.637 --> 01:32:40.054
I'm so sorry.

01:32:46.311 --> 01:32:47.895
You must be dead

01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:54.318
because I don't know how to feel.

01:32:57.989 --> 01:33:00.241
I can't feel anything anymore.

01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:05.829
You've gone someplace else now.

01:33:14.214 --> 01:33:16.507
I'll believe in you all my life.

01:33:18.343 --> 01:33:19.760
Every day.

01:33:24.683 --> 01:33:25.891
E.T.,

01:33:29.062 --> 01:33:30.604
I love you.

01:34:02.095 --> 01:34:03.846
Oh, my God.

01:34:10.603 --> 01:34:12.688
E.T. phone home.

01:34:13.064 --> 01:34:16.191
Home. Phone home.

01:34:16.735 --> 01:34:18.152
Phone home.

01:34:18.611 --> 01:34:20.237
Does this mean they're coming?

01:34:20.697 --> 01:34:22.114
Yes.

01:34:24.868 --> 01:34:27.828
E.T. phone home.
E.T. phone home.

01:34:27.912 --> 01:34:29.288
Stay.

01:34:29.372 --> 01:34:31.165
Shut up.

01:34:31.249 --> 01:34:32.458
Phone.

01:34:32.542 --> 01:34:33.834
- Phone home.
- Quiet!

01:34:33.918 --> 01:34:35.669
Phone! Phone! Phone!

01:34:35.754 --> 01:34:37.755
Would you shut up?

01:34:37.839 --> 01:34:40.215
Phone home. E.T. phone home.

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:43.010
E.T. phone home.
E.T. phone home.

01:34:43.261 --> 01:34:44.762
E.T. phone home.

01:34:44.888 --> 01:34:46.180
Phone home.

01:34:46.264 --> 01:34:48.474
Phone home. Elliott.

01:34:48.558 --> 01:34:51.352
Elliott. Elliott. Elliott.

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:55.981
Elliott?

01:35:05.158 --> 01:35:07.117
- Elliott?
- No.

01:35:08.119 --> 01:35:11.705
- Elliott, why don't you come with me?
- No. No.

01:35:13.291 --> 01:35:14.958
- It's all right.
- No, no.

01:35:18.213 --> 01:35:19.922
It'll be all right.

01:35:20.632 --> 01:35:22.841
Would you like the flowers?

01:35:26.805 --> 01:35:30.057
He's alive! He's alive!

01:35:43.905 --> 01:35:45.823
Are they gone, Mama?

01:35:46.282 --> 01:35:48.492
- Who's gone, honey?
- The boys.

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:49.743
What boys?

01:35:50.370 --> 01:35:53.664
I'm supposed to give you this note
when they're gone.

01:35:55.667 --> 01:35:57.376
Give it to me now, Gertie.

01:36:04.968 --> 01:36:06.677
Oh, my God.

01:36:15.687 --> 01:36:17.563
Give me a hand with this.

01:36:25.655 --> 01:36:27.781
- Where's your mask?
- It's back here.

01:36:27.866 --> 01:36:29.783
- Well, get it on!
- I'm trying!

01:36:36.541 --> 01:36:38.584
Hey, who are you?

01:36:39.294 --> 01:36:40.919
I'm driving.

01:36:42.422 --> 01:36:44.006
Open the door, son.

01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:46.091
There's a guy out here.
What do I do?

01:36:46.217 --> 01:36:48.385
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:51.305
Well, let's get out of here, Michael!

01:36:51.389 --> 01:36:54.224
I've never driven forward before!

01:37:03.026 --> 01:37:05.986
Get the bikes. Meet us at the playground
at the top of the hill.

01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:07.321
Let's do it!

01:37:09.115 --> 01:37:12.242
Come on, Michael!
Go, go, go!

01:37:27.926 --> 01:37:30.761
We're all gonna die,
and they're never gonna give me my license.

01:37:34.098 --> 01:37:37.684
- Where's the playground?
- It's near the preschool!

01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:42.105
- Where's that?
- I don't know streets. Mom always drives me.

01:37:42.982 --> 01:37:44.358
Son of a bitch.

01:38:10.343 --> 01:38:13.554
- Where are you going?
- To the spaceship.

01:38:13.638 --> 01:38:17.266
- Spaceship?
- To the spaceship to the moon.

01:38:17.684 --> 01:38:19.142
Quiet!

01:38:20.770 --> 01:38:22.062
Oh, my God.

01:38:23.022 --> 01:38:24.731
Stop the van!

01:38:28.486 --> 01:38:30.279
Don't pull them off!

01:38:43.918 --> 01:38:45.335
That did it!

01:39:33.718 --> 01:39:38.055
Okay. He's a man from outer space
and we're taking him to his spaceship.

01:39:38.723 --> 01:39:40.891
Well, can't he just beam up?

01:39:41.142 --> 01:39:42.809
This is reality, Greg.

01:39:45.396 --> 01:39:46.772
- Keep her back!
- No!

01:39:46.898 --> 01:39:50.734
- Hold her back!
- No guns! They're children!

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:53.570
 No! No! No!

01:39:53.655 --> 01:39:54.988
- Where are they?
- No!

01:39:55.406 --> 01:39:57.115
There's nobody here.

01:40:04.832 --> 01:40:06.166
Where are we going?

01:40:06.250 --> 01:40:07.626
To the forest!

01:40:10.922 --> 01:40:12.214
Follow me!

01:40:44.872 --> 01:40:46.623
We got them,
at the bottom of the hill.

01:41:02.849 --> 01:41:04.433
This is Unit 302.

01:41:04.517 --> 01:41:07.853
We've cut the kids off at the bottom of the hill.
Send backup units.

01:41:32.587 --> 01:41:34.045
Let's split up.

01:41:34.338 --> 01:41:35.338
Okay!

01:41:43.765 --> 01:41:45.348
Hang on!

01:42:06.078 --> 01:42:08.538
We made it! Oh, shit!

01:42:48.538 --> 01:42:50.455
Tell me when it's over!

01:44:03.446 --> 01:44:04.738
Home.

01:44:52.536 --> 01:44:54.329
Stop the car, Mama!

01:44:54.413 --> 01:44:57.332
They're over there!
They're over there!

01:45:13.224 --> 01:45:16.184
I just wanted to say goodbye.

01:45:17.895 --> 01:45:19.729
He doesn't know goodbye.

01:45:22.191 --> 01:45:24.234
Be good.

01:45:25.903 --> 01:45:26.987
Yes.

01:45:55.057 --> 01:45:57.976
Thank you.

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:01.062
You're welcome.

01:46:27.715 --> 01:46:28.798
Come.

01:46:33.345 --> 01:46:34.888
Stay.

01:48:06.438 --> 01:48:11.442
I'll be right here.

01:48:21.412 --> 01:48:22.495
Bye.
