-[Esmé] Sugar?
-[Kit] No, thank you.

01:32.416 --> 01:34.291
I always thought
tea should be bitter as wormwood

01:34.375 --> 01:36.000
and sharp as a double-edged sword.

01:36.083 --> 01:37.208
[Esmé] I think you'll find

01:37.291 --> 01:38.583
this sugar is extremely bitter.

Oh, good, they stopped singing.

I'm new dramatic critic
for  The Daily Punctilio.

02:11.416 --> 02:12.708
Critic? Bah!

02:12.791 --> 02:15.458
We theatrical types
should be complimented, not criticized.

02:15.541 --> 02:16.916
You'll find this interesting, Olaf.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.500
"Theatrical" is a word
which here means "related to the theater,"

02:19.583 --> 02:22.208
but it can also mean a person
who is prone to fits of melodrama.

02:22.291 --> 02:23.750

As chief of your Official Fire Department,
I would like to take this intermission

02:33.125 --> 02:36.000
to offer a few words
about fire safety, particularly

02:36.083 --> 02:37.583
He's so embarrassing.

02:37.666 --> 02:38.958
I think he looks noble.

You were radiant.

[laughs] It's so wonderful
to see all of you together.

03:06.791 --> 03:09.208
[fire chief] I should like
to dedicate these words to my wife,

03:09.291 --> 03:11.250
who sadly perished in a fire,

03:11.708 --> 03:15.291
and to my son, who is here somewhere
in the audience tonight.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.458
I love you, Olaf.

03:17.958 --> 03:19.875
Stay safe, and good night.

03:20.375 --> 03:23.250
And now, back to the tragedy
you were watching.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.291
The past haunts the present

03:29.375 --> 03:32.000
the way a ghost
might haunt an opera house.

03:32.083 --> 03:35.833
It hovers over it the way a murder
of crows might hover over a hotel.

The past can hit you like a rock,

03:58.041 --> 04:00.500
and it can trap you
like a sticky piece of flypaper.

04:03.291 --> 04:06.500
It can spin you in cycles
like a wet pair of pants.

04:08.708 --> 04:10.250
And it can change you,

04:10.833 --> 04:14.041

would change my own life...

04:14.833 --> 04:15.666

Snicket.

I'm sorry, do we know you?

Somebody shot that manager
and he fell into the pond!

04:26.541 --> 04:28.583
I saw it while I was bird-watching!

04:28.666 --> 04:30.583
Those concierges shot the manager!

04:30.666 --> 04:32.791
I saw it while I was ironing
my cummerbund!

04:32.875 --> 04:34.791
We didn't do anything. It was an accident.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.666
They don't know that.
What can we do?

04:36.750 --> 04:37.791
You can get in my taxi.

04:39.416 --> 04:41.166
Sometimes when
I'm in a dangerous situation,

04:41.250 --> 04:44.333
such as a public place where I'm being
accused of a murder that I did not commit,

04:44.416 --> 04:46.416
I find it useful
to get away quickly in a taxi.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.750
-Where's Kit? She was supposed to meet us.
-I'm her brother. She sent me to help you.

04:49.833 --> 04:51.750
I can only help
if you get in this taxi right now.

04:51.833 --> 04:52.666
Baudelaires!

04:52.750 --> 04:53.750
Baudelaires!

04:53.833 --> 04:57.708
I heard there was trouble,
so I found these friendly police officers.

04:57.791 --> 04:59.708
We should leave
before those officers reach us.

04:59.791 --> 05:01.500
They don't look friendly,
and I'm on the lam.

05:01.583 --> 05:04.208
So are we. Violet, maybe leaving
isn't such a bad idea.

05:04.291 --> 05:06.750
If we leave, we'll miss the chance
to put Count Olaf in jail.

05:06.833 --> 05:08.166
We can't live on the run forever.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.291
It's not hard.
You just have to evade the authorities,

05:10.375 --> 05:12.000
fake your death
in an unreliable newspaper,

05:12.083 --> 05:14.666
and spend the rest of your days
hiding out in a series of anonymous,

05:14.750 --> 05:15.666
interchangeable motels.

05:15.750 --> 05:16.791
Sounds like a lonely life.

05:16.875 --> 05:18.708
It is, but you'd be safe.

Baudelaires, is everything all right?

05:28.333 --> 05:30.750
I heard there was some trouble
with a harpoon gun

05:30.833 --> 05:32.083
and one of the managers?

05:32.166 --> 05:34.125
It was an accident.
It was Count Olaf.

05:34.208 --> 05:37.916
[sighs] Well, you won't have to worry
about him for long.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.041
Come with me. You'll be safe. I promise.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.666
We should say goodbye
to the man with the taxi.

05:48.958 --> 05:50.458

Come, come.

06:00.458 --> 06:01.875
There you are, Baudelaires!

06:01.958 --> 06:04.458
After you shot that manager,
I went inside and found the manager.

06:04.541 --> 06:05.708
Wait, that can't be right.

06:05.791 --> 06:07.125
Trust me. It can.

06:07.208 --> 06:09.333
Those are the children
I saw from my window!

06:09.416 --> 06:11.250
I recognize them from the newspaper!

06:11.333 --> 06:13.250
They murdered a man named Count Olaf
in a village!

06:13.333 --> 06:15.750
I recognize them from my village,

06:15.833 --> 06:19.041
where they murdered Count Olaf!

06:19.416 --> 06:21.083
[murmuring]

06:21.166 --> 06:24.458
Now, let's not rush
to judgment, everyone!

06:24.541 --> 06:28.583
Something terrible has happened here,
but we don't have all the facts.

06:29.125 --> 06:30.916
Now go back to your rooms.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.916
Count Olaf's trial
will begin tomorrow morning.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.833
I thought Count Olaf was dead.

06:35.916 --> 06:38.166
You can't believe anything you read
in  The Daily Punctilio.

06:38.250 --> 06:39.958
I don't know who writes that hogwash!

06:40.250 --> 06:41.166
Your wife?

06:42.125 --> 06:44.541
You said the trial would be on Thursday.
That's two days away.

06:44.625 --> 06:46.833
You can't start tomorrow.
What about the other volunteers?

06:46.916 --> 06:49.541
If they were noble volunteers,
they would have arrived early.

06:49.625 --> 06:50.583
What about Kit Snicket?

06:50.666 --> 06:53.125
I'm sorry, children.
I would like to wait for her, too,

06:53.208 --> 06:55.958
but unfortunately,
things are much worse than they seem.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.625
The trial will take place
right here in this lobby.

06:58.708 --> 07:00.666
Aren't trials typically held
in a courthouse?

07:00.750 --> 07:01.958
Usually,

07:02.041 --> 07:05.500
but it's much easier to get
people to come to a fivestar hotel.

07:05.583 --> 07:08.750
Excuse me, Your Honor.
I caught Count Olaf lurking in the hedges.

07:08.833 --> 07:10.083
Thank you, Frank.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.583
Nice try, but this isn't Frank,
it's Ernest!

07:12.666 --> 07:13.708
Actually, I am Frank.

07:13.791 --> 07:14.916

07:16.708 --> 07:17.708

07:17.791 --> 07:20.083
Well, if it isn't the nosy neighbor.

07:20.166 --> 07:22.083
I hope you've been picking up my mail.

07:22.166 --> 07:24.708
You won't be receiving mail
for a very long time,

07:24.791 --> 07:27.666
unless you change your mailing address
to prison.

07:27.750 --> 07:30.500
Why would I change my address to prison?
Because you'll be a prisoner!

07:32.500 --> 07:34.333
Lock him up until the trial!

07:35.041 --> 07:36.916
Oh, yes, lock me up!

07:37.000 --> 07:39.458
We can't have treacherous people
running around a hotel.

07:39.541 --> 07:41.916
There might be decent, noble people here!

07:42.000 --> 07:43.791
There  are  decent, noble people here.

07:43.875 --> 07:46.458
V.F.D. is here, and they'll make sure
you pay for your crimes.

07:46.916 --> 07:49.875
I see your new friends
have been keeping you in the dark.

07:49.958 --> 07:51.166
[Klaus] What does that mean?

07:51.250 --> 07:53.375
You think V.F.D. is noble?

07:53.458 --> 07:54.583
Think again.

07:54.916 --> 07:58.583
I bet your self-righteous volunteers
never told you what's in the sugar bowl,

07:58.666 --> 08:01.500
why it's important, or how it was stolen,

08:01.583 --> 08:02.791
but I could.

08:03.125 --> 08:05.500
Oh, the secrets I could share...

08:06.958 --> 08:09.583
about V.F.D., about your parents.

08:10.791 --> 08:14.541
You think you know this story,
but you don't even know how it begins.

08:14.625 --> 08:15.958
We'll find out the truth.

08:16.041 --> 08:17.291
Not if I'm in prison.

08:17.875 --> 08:20.708
I'm your last chance to learn
what really happened.

08:20.791 --> 08:23.916
I can tell you things
that you'll never learn on your own.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.416
We'd rather see you in jail.

08:26.416 --> 08:27.583

Let's go, buddy.

-Frank, we're sorry about your brother.
-I don't see what the big deal is.

08:45.875 --> 08:48.791
[Violet] Justice Strauss, are you sure
the High Court can handle Count Olaf?

08:48.875 --> 08:51.250
[Strauss] I don't blame you
for having doubts, Baudelaires.

08:51.333 --> 08:54.666
Count Olaf fooled me once,
and I will never forgive myself,

08:54.750 --> 08:57.708
but there are two other judges
on the High Court,

08:57.791 --> 08:59.708
and I've known them for years,

08:59.791 --> 09:03.916
and they've always been very concerned
whenever I've reported on your case.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.708
I hope you can forgive me,
Baudelaires, and trust me.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.250
But if not,

09:09.333 --> 09:10.791
you can trust the law.

Maybe we deserve to be locked up.

Dewey was a good person,
and he's dead because of us.

09:21.375 --> 09:23.000
He's dead because of Count Olaf,

09:23.083 --> 09:25.416
and tomorrow, we can help
put him behind bars for good.

09:25.500 --> 09:26.916
Count Olaf has fooled people before.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.833
How do we know
he's not gonna fool the High Court?

09:28.916 --> 09:30.833
We'll prepare
for any tricks he might pull.

09:30.916 --> 09:33.291
Have you read anything about trials?
Not much.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.416
This is Room 342.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.958
In a library, 342 is the Dewey
Decimal Number for "criminal law."

09:38.291 --> 09:39.333
Therefore...

09:41.708 --> 09:42.541
Criminal Law.

It's almost morning,
and there are lots of laws.

-You'll have to read quickly.
-Mother said laws are like sausages.

09:47.125 --> 09:49.375
If you learn how they're made,
it can ruin your breakfast.

09:50.041 --> 09:51.791
Sunny, how do you make sausages?

09:54.125 --> 09:57.125
Shove the meat in. Don't worry about
the bones. That's what the grinder is for.

09:57.208 --> 09:59.708
I thought we were gonna get a sugar bowl
and have a tea party,

but we're squishing together
different parts of animals.

10:02.041 --> 10:03.166
Patience, darling.

10:03.916 --> 10:06.000
Mother used to say
revenge is like making sausages.

10:06.083 --> 10:09.041
If you do it right,
you can ruin someone's breakfast.

[clock bongs, "Wrong!"]

10:47.500 --> 10:48.750
[clock bongs, "Wrong!"]

10:50.208 --> 10:51.541
[clock bongs, "Wrong!"]

10:52.166 --> 10:54.083
It feels wrong to go to court
wearing disguises.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.041
It's a note from Justice Strauss.

11:01.125 --> 11:03.208
"I hope these fit. I know you've grown."

11:03.666 --> 11:05.125
We haven't just grown. We've changed.

11:05.791 --> 11:08.083
Baudelaires, why haven't you changed?
The trial is starting.

11:08.166 --> 11:09.750
Justice Strauss has sent me to escort you

11:09.833 --> 11:11.791
and to give you these blindfolds.
Blindfolds?

11:11.875 --> 11:14.041
Everyone wears blindfolds
to enter a High Court trial.

11:14.125 --> 11:16.125
Haven't you heard the expression,
"justice is blind?"

11:16.208 --> 11:19.333
Yes, but that just means that justice
should be fair and unprejudiced.

11:19.875 --> 11:23.208
Well, the High Court ruled that we should
interpret that expression literally,

11:23.291 --> 11:25.500
so everyone must cover their eyes
before the trial starts.

11:27.125 --> 11:30.666
What my sister means is
the literal interpretation makes no sense.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.666
Well, the interpretation of laws
can be perplexing,

11:33.750 --> 11:35.583
like the interpretation of sausages.

11:36.208 --> 11:37.166
I'll wait in the hall.

11:39.458 --> 11:40.458
[sighing]

11:40.541 --> 11:41.583
[bell dings]

11:46.250 --> 11:48.375
Fourth floor, food supply. Make it snappy.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.041
Hello, Esmé.
Have we met? You sound familiar.

11:54.750 --> 11:56.125
It's me, Jerome.

11:56.208 --> 11:57.250
Your husband?

11:57.333 --> 11:58.375
Oh,  that  Jerome!

11:58.833 --> 12:00.916
I'd completely forgotten your name.
And your face.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.958
-Hm!
-Are you here for the trial?

12:03.041 --> 12:06.083
I'm here in the name of justice, which is
something you'll never understand.

12:06.166 --> 12:08.208
Darling, justice is out. Injustice is in.

12:08.291 --> 12:12.541
That's why it's called injustice.
Then why on earth are you here?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.500
We're gonna make those cakesniffers pay.

12:15.583 --> 12:17.541
My daughter. Isn't she adorable?

12:17.625 --> 12:19.125
-[bell dings]
-Ah!

12:19.208 --> 12:20.291
Lovely catching up.

12:20.958 --> 12:22.125
Ugh!

12:24.875 --> 12:26.416
[Esmé] What a stupid elevator.

12:33.250 --> 12:36.500
[quietly screaming]

12:36.583 --> 12:38.916
[coughing]

12:40.708 --> 12:41.583
Put this on.

12:43.125 --> 12:43.958
Ow!

12:44.333 --> 12:45.375
Ouch!

12:46.000 --> 12:47.166
Let's see...

12:47.916 --> 12:48.750
Where am I?

12:48.833 --> 12:50.708
[laughs] I can't see!

12:51.666 --> 12:52.958
Oh, that's good. Good.

12:53.375 --> 12:54.333
Uh, we're ready.

12:54.416 --> 12:56.416
Excellent! I'm wearing a blindfold, too,

12:56.500 --> 13:00.166
so you'll just have to feel around
with your hand to find-- Oh!-- find me.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.458
[whispering] Come on.

13:01.541 --> 13:05.500
This is like the blind leading the blind,
an expression that I just made up myself.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.041
It's already an expression.

13:07.125 --> 13:10.041
It means the people in charge don't know
any more than the people following.

13:10.125 --> 13:12.333
That hardly seems relevant.
This way to the elevator!

13:12.416 --> 13:14.458
Oh, sorry. Ma'am, excuse me.

13:16.875 --> 13:18.666
[Poe screams, groans]

13:18.750 --> 13:20.958
I have to tell you, children-- sorry--

13:21.041 --> 13:24.708
I had my doubts about Count Olaf
from the moment I placed you in his care,

13:24.791 --> 13:27.000
and today,
the world will finally see the truth!

13:27.083 --> 13:29.583
It's hard to see anything
with these blindfolds on.

13:29.666 --> 13:32.458
-Oh, what a lovely sculpture of a snake.
-[bell dings]

13:33.333 --> 13:35.708
This must be the elevator over this way.

13:35.791 --> 13:36.791
[yelps]

13:37.291 --> 13:38.500
[groans]

13:38.583 --> 13:39.500
That hurt.

13:39.583 --> 13:40.625
[groans]

13:40.708 --> 13:41.541
[knocking]

13:43.583 --> 13:45.375
Attention, everyone!

13:45.458 --> 13:47.583
The trial is about to begin.

13:47.666 --> 13:50.625
If you are still standing,
please take your seats.

13:50.708 --> 13:52.791
How can we find our seats?
We can't see them.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.250
Oh... Um, move to your left.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.458
Oh, no. Sorry, my left.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.041
A little more. Little more.

14:00.791 --> 14:01.750
-[Poe yelps]
-[woman] Ow!

14:01.833 --> 14:02.916
Ooh, not that far.

14:03.541 --> 14:05.166
She was terrifying!

14:05.458 --> 14:09.166
Those beady little eyes.
That bloodthirsty smile.

14:09.250 --> 14:12.500
Yes, I've also been trapped in an elevator
with Esmé Squalor.

14:12.583 --> 14:15.541
Esmé? I was talking
about that awful little girl!

14:15.625 --> 14:17.916
-[Jerome yelps]
-Wrong seat, cakesniffer!

14:18.000 --> 14:19.750
[whimpering] It's her! It's her! It's her!

14:20.125 --> 14:22.166
[Strauss] Remember, if anyone peeks,

14:22.541 --> 14:25.208
they will be held in contempt of court.

14:25.291 --> 14:26.458
Is everyone seated?

14:27.041 --> 14:28.916
There's Klaus.
[Strauss] Good.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.250
You may remove your blindfolds.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.750
[groaning]

14:32.833 --> 14:34.916
But we just put them on.
Don't be silly, Klaus.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.333
Justice may be blind,

14:36.416 --> 14:39.208
but the High Court ruled
the evidence must be seen to be believed.

14:39.291 --> 14:42.250
You will put the blindfolds back on
for the verdict.

14:42.333 --> 14:43.666
That doesn't make any sense.

14:44.625 --> 14:48.166
Baudelaires, I see you found the clothes
I left for you.

14:48.250 --> 14:50.000
They fit perfectly, thank you.

14:50.083 --> 14:52.375
I can't wait to see Count Olaf
pay for his crimes.

14:52.458 --> 14:55.875
He infiltrated my school and didn't attend
a single one of my violin recitals!

14:55.958 --> 14:58.875
He's a very bad man
who owes me a lot of candy.

14:58.958 --> 15:01.666
Not like that nice gym teacher,
Coach Genghis.

15:01.750 --> 15:05.166
I attended Prufrock Preparatory School.
Give my regards to the principal.

15:05.250 --> 15:06.625
"Give my regards to the principal."

15:06.708 --> 15:08.958
Everybody knows that the vice principal
is more important!

15:09.041 --> 15:11.291
Besides, that guy disappeared ages ago.

15:11.375 --> 15:13.250
No one's seen him in years.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.500
-I hope they cut off Count Olaf's head!
-[gavel pounding]

15:17.666 --> 15:20.958
All rise for the High Court judges,

15:21.041 --> 15:24.666
myself and my esteemed colleagues.

15:30.958 --> 15:32.083
Why are they so high up?

15:32.166 --> 15:34.958
The High Court ruled
to interpret their name literally.

15:35.041 --> 15:36.083
[Jerome] Hm.

15:36.166 --> 15:37.000
You may sit.

15:39.083 --> 15:41.166
Bring in Count Olaf!

15:43.708 --> 15:45.916
Please hold the applause!

15:46.000 --> 15:47.750
-No, don't clap for him!
-[scattered clapping]

15:47.833 --> 15:49.666
This is a courtroom, not a theater!

15:50.125 --> 15:51.333
I thought this was a hotel.

15:51.416 --> 15:54.541
It's a hotel acting in the role
of a courtroom.

15:55.083 --> 15:59.625
Thanks to the efforts of many
concerned parties and a banker,

16:00.083 --> 16:04.833
I have compiled a comprehensive file
on the Baudelaire case.

16:07.875 --> 16:10.041
I submit to the Court...

16:11.458 --> 16:13.958
The Complete History of Injustice

16:14.041 --> 16:17.500
or Odious Lusting After Fortunes.

16:18.666 --> 16:19.666
I titled it myself.

16:19.750 --> 16:23.833
Sadly, I must also submit
this harpoon gun,

16:24.416 --> 16:28.666
which was used to kill a hotel manager
late last night,

16:28.750 --> 16:30.791
but we'll discuss that later.

16:30.875 --> 16:33.625
The judges will now hear this case,

16:33.708 --> 16:36.083
while the authorities wait outside

16:36.166 --> 16:39.250
to apprehend any guilty party
who tries to escape.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.500
Speaking of parties, after the trial,

16:41.583 --> 16:44.166
everyone is welcome to the after-party,
hosted by me.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.250
Wealthy women are particularly welcome.

16:46.333 --> 16:47.583
I'm also having a party.

16:47.666 --> 16:50.666
It's a cocktail party,
and fashionable men get a free gift.

16:50.750 --> 16:54.416
My party will have Broadway-caliber
musical numbers.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.791
My party will have an adorable girl
doing a tap routine.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.500
My party will have fireworks!

16:58.583 --> 17:00.416
My party will have sausages!

17:00.500 --> 17:01.333
[gavel pounds]

17:01.416 --> 17:02.291
Order in the court!

17:02.375 --> 17:05.625
We are discussing social justice,
not social engagements.

17:05.708 --> 17:08.750
You should reconsider. I don't imagine
you get invited to a lot of parties.

17:08.833 --> 17:10.083
That is enough!

17:10.166 --> 17:12.333
I call our first witnesses.

17:12.833 --> 17:14.208
That's you, Baudelaires.

17:15.791 --> 17:17.666
Please state your names.

17:17.750 --> 17:20.541
We know them, of course.
It's just standard procedure.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.333
Violet Baudelaire.
Klaus Baudelaire.

17:23.750 --> 17:24.666
Occupation?

17:24.750 --> 17:26.083
Inventor.
Researcher.

17:27.125 --> 17:29.875
I object!
Their proper occupation is orphan,

17:29.958 --> 17:31.666
or inheritor of a large fortune.

17:31.750 --> 17:36.458
Your objection is noted, though I caution
the defendant about speaking out of turn.

17:36.541 --> 17:38.041
Is this out of turn?
Yes!

17:39.333 --> 17:42.375
Baudelaires, you have traveled
a great distance

17:42.458 --> 17:44.125
and suffered a great deal,

17:44.583 --> 17:46.541
but you're finally safe,

17:46.958 --> 17:48.916
among friends and associates,

17:49.291 --> 17:51.666
classmates and co-workers,

17:51.750 --> 17:53.416
-faculty members...
-[snoring]

17:53.500 --> 17:55.791
...and countless neighbors,

17:55.875 --> 17:57.125
reporters,

17:57.208 --> 17:58.583
theatergoers,

17:58.666 --> 18:00.041
fashionistas,

18:00.125 --> 18:01.833
doctors, nurses,

18:01.916 --> 18:03.166
carnival guests,

18:03.250 --> 18:04.666
mountain climbers,

18:04.750 --> 18:06.500
telegraph operators,

18:06.583 --> 18:08.375
and deep-sea divers.

18:08.458 --> 18:11.875
They have been watching you
all along the way

18:11.958 --> 18:15.125
and are prepared to speak out
on your behalf,

18:15.208 --> 18:19.125
but the most important testimony is yours.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.791
Go on, Baudelaires. Tell us your story.

18:22.208 --> 18:24.875
This time, we promise to listen.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.750
It began when our parents told us
to take a rickety trolley to Briny Beach.

18:29.833 --> 18:32.375
It was a gray and cloudy day,
so we had the beach to ourselves.

18:32.458 --> 18:33.958
[Violet] We were testing an invention

18:34.041 --> 18:37.041
when we saw a figure in the mist.
It was Mr. Poe from the bank.

18:38.000 --> 18:38.916
He told us...

18:39.791 --> 18:42.583
He told us our parents had perished
in a terrible fire.

18:42.666 --> 18:43.625
Hm.

18:43.708 --> 18:45.208
We went to live with Count Olaf.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.125
He hit Klaus across the face!
He tried to marry Violet!

18:48.416 --> 18:49.750
He poisoned Uncle Monty!

18:49.833 --> 18:51.666
He threw Aunt Josephine to the leeches!

18:51.750 --> 18:54.291
-He conspired with Esmé Squalor.
-And Carmelita Spats.

18:54.375 --> 18:56.708
He kidnapped the Quagmire triplets
from Prufrock Prep.

18:56.791 --> 18:59.250
He murdered Jacques Snicket
in the Village of Fowl Devotees.

18:59.333 --> 19:01.750
He tried to cut off Violet's head
at the Heimlich Hospital.

19:02.541 --> 19:03.666
He... He threw...

19:04.541 --> 19:08.583
He threw a brave and noble librarian
to the lions.

19:09.041 --> 19:10.375
Everywhere we went,

19:10.458 --> 19:13.125
we tried to tell people who he was
and what he was capable of!

19:13.208 --> 19:15.250
But they wouldn't listen!
Nobody would listen!

19:15.333 --> 19:17.583
How simply dreadful!
We lost everything.

19:17.666 --> 19:18.750
Except each other.

19:18.833 --> 19:22.291
We survived because we believed
that one day we'd find a safe place.

19:22.375 --> 19:23.625
Where people would listen to us.

19:23.708 --> 19:24.750
And believe us.

19:24.833 --> 19:27.583
We've suffered so much,
but the root of our suffering is one man.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.208
That man...

19:29.291 --> 19:30.458
[Klaus] Count Olaf.

19:31.416 --> 19:35.958
This world won't be quiet or safe
until he's behind bars.

19:36.041 --> 19:39.041
And all decent people
have their day in court.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.333
Thank you.

20:03.416 --> 20:04.541
They're so brave!

20:04.625 --> 20:05.958
They're so organized!

20:06.041 --> 20:07.458
They remind me of myself!

20:07.541 --> 20:10.166
If only you children had told me
what you were going through.

20:17.291 --> 20:18.583
[Strauss] Thank you, Baudelaires.

20:18.666 --> 20:21.166
We are grateful for your courage.

20:21.458 --> 20:22.916
You may step down now.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.833
I had planned to call other witnesses,

20:27.916 --> 20:31.500
but your testimony was so compelling,
I hate to waste another second.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.833
I'm going to consult
with my fellow judges,

20:34.916 --> 20:36.666
and if they agree,

20:36.750 --> 20:41.291
we can declare these unfortunate events
over at last.

20:41.375 --> 20:42.208
That's a relief.

20:42.291 --> 20:45.333
That book on criminal law said that trials
can last days or even years.

20:45.416 --> 20:47.333
That's what I'm worried about.
Look at Olaf.

20:47.416 --> 20:49.208
He's about to go to jail.
Why does he look calm?

20:49.291 --> 20:50.375
Maybe he's acting calm.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.541
We both know he's not that good.
Something's wrong.

20:55.500 --> 20:58.791
It seems my fellow judges
are ready to deliberate.

20:58.875 --> 21:00.333
So without further ado--

21:00.416 --> 21:02.958
A violin solo about a naval disaster!

21:04.416 --> 21:06.750
No! No, please stop that!

21:08.208 --> 21:11.958
We will now retire to decide the verdict.

21:12.916 --> 21:15.041
Rest assured, Baudelaires,

21:15.125 --> 21:18.166
your word is all the evidence we need.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.750
Your Honor, wait!
Klaus, do you have an objection?

21:20.833 --> 21:22.166
Klaus, what are you doing?

21:22.250 --> 21:24.708
Justice Strauss says our word
is enough to convince the judges,

21:24.791 --> 21:26.791
but it's never been enough
to convince anyone before,

21:26.875 --> 21:27.875
and Count Olaf knows that.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.666
They need to hear from someone else.

21:29.750 --> 21:31.750
One who knows the wicked things
Count Olaf has done,

21:31.833 --> 21:34.291
who wouldn't pass up the chance
to speak in front of a crowd.

21:34.375 --> 21:36.000
Baudelaires, is there a problem?

21:36.083 --> 21:38.750
Not at all, Your Honor.
We'd like to call a witness of our own.

21:38.833 --> 21:41.583
A witness calling a witness?
That's highly unusual.

21:41.666 --> 21:44.791
According to a book on criminal law,
a witness may question another witness

21:44.875 --> 21:46.333
if they're acting  in loco advocatus.

21:46.416 --> 21:47.833
In the role of an attorney.

21:47.916 --> 21:50.500
I see you've kept up your legal studies,

21:50.583 --> 21:53.958
but wouldn't you rather see
this story over, once and for all?

21:54.041 --> 21:55.708
We would. That's why we have to do this.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.208
The floor is yours, Baudelaires.

22:00.291 --> 22:01.291
Thank you, Your Honor.

22:01.375 --> 22:03.125
We call Count Olaf to the stand!

22:03.208 --> 22:04.416
[gasping]

22:10.791 --> 22:12.000
You may applaud.

22:17.458 --> 22:19.250
Will the defendant state his name.

22:19.333 --> 22:20.583
Count Olaf.

22:20.666 --> 22:21.666
Occupation?

22:21.750 --> 22:23.041
Impresario.

22:23.125 --> 22:24.958
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

22:25.041 --> 22:26.083
and nothing but the truth?

22:26.166 --> 22:29.250
I have never told a lie in my life.
That's a lie!

22:29.333 --> 22:31.833
You can't prove that.
That's the whole point of this trial.

22:31.916 --> 22:35.541
Ah, but I've always been honest
about my desires, orphans:

22:35.625 --> 22:40.375
you, maimed or dead, and your fortune
in my rarelywashed hands.

22:40.458 --> 22:43.333
That's more
than the rest of these people can say.

22:43.416 --> 22:44.958
These people are here to help us.

22:45.041 --> 22:45.958
Help you?

22:46.375 --> 22:47.583
Look around!

22:47.875 --> 22:51.500
I see a banker who cares more
about a promotion than three orphans.

22:51.583 --> 22:53.250
Vice President of Orphan Affairs.

22:53.958 --> 22:56.375
I see a man who was too afraid
to protect you,

22:56.458 --> 23:00.291
and a woman who values paperwork
over people's lives.

23:00.375 --> 23:04.000
I see a vice principal who was more
than happy to let me into his school,

23:04.083 --> 23:06.083
as long as I stroked his ego.

23:06.166 --> 23:08.208
That's a lie! He only stroked my...

23:08.916 --> 23:09.750
violin.

23:09.833 --> 23:12.750
I see rich people who only cared about you
because you were "in,"

23:12.833 --> 23:15.708
and villagers who only took you in
to do their chores.

23:16.125 --> 23:21.791
I see volunteers whose complicated codes
and pretentious literary references

23:21.875 --> 23:24.958
are useless against the real treacheries
of the world.

23:25.041 --> 23:26.958
And presiding over them all,

23:27.041 --> 23:29.291
a justice so blind

23:29.375 --> 23:31.208
she let me marry you!

23:32.291 --> 23:34.875
These so-called decent people

23:34.958 --> 23:38.166
have done more to help my schemes
than any of my associates.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.666
They should be up here right now.

23:39.750 --> 23:40.916
They're not. You are.

23:41.000 --> 23:41.875
Yes...

23:42.458 --> 23:44.625
but you're up here too, Baudelaires.

23:44.708 --> 23:45.541
Tell me...

23:46.083 --> 23:51.500
on Mount Fraught, what despicable act
did you perform to rescue your sister?

23:52.458 --> 23:53.625
We held Esmé--

23:53.708 --> 23:55.833
Louder, please, for the Court.

23:55.916 --> 23:57.666
We held Esmé Squalor hostage--

23:57.750 --> 24:01.166
And when you needed to reach V.F.D.
headquarters in the Mortmain Mountains,

24:01.250 --> 24:02.958
what did you help me do?

24:03.416 --> 24:05.333
Burn down Caligari Carnival, but--

24:05.416 --> 24:06.916
Let's hear from some witnesses. You!

24:07.000 --> 24:10.333
Who caused all the terrible accidents
at Lucky Smells Lumbermill?

24:10.416 --> 24:12.375
Klaus Baudelaire, but--

24:12.458 --> 24:16.750
You! Who stole Hal's keys and broke
into the library at Heimlich Hospital?

24:16.833 --> 24:18.000
Violet Baudelaire, but--

24:18.083 --> 24:19.333
You in the crow hat!

24:19.416 --> 24:22.625
After the Baudelaires were accused
of murder in the Village of Fowl Devotees,

24:22.708 --> 24:24.291
did they accept their punishment?

24:24.375 --> 24:26.625
That baby busted them out of jail!

24:26.708 --> 24:28.833
You were going to burn us at the stake!

24:28.916 --> 24:31.250
Well....
And I don't need to ask you

24:31.333 --> 24:33.250
who shot Dewey Denouement,

24:33.333 --> 24:34.791
for I was there.

24:34.875 --> 24:38.291
It was Violet, Klaus,
and Sunny Baudelaire,

24:38.625 --> 24:42.416
by the pond, with the harpoon gun!

24:42.500 --> 24:43.333
[gasping]

24:43.416 --> 24:45.458
Baudelaires, is this true?

24:45.541 --> 24:46.625
[Olaf] Let me remind you,

24:46.708 --> 24:47.958
you're under oath.

24:49.416 --> 24:50.958
It's not the whole truth.

24:51.458 --> 24:53.791
You're manipulating the facts!
[Olaf] So are you.

24:53.875 --> 24:57.333
You're not the innocent orphans
you've let these people think you are.

24:57.416 --> 24:58.583
You've lied.

24:59.125 --> 25:00.250
You've stolen.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.166
You've abandoned people.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.875
You've set fires.

25:03.958 --> 25:05.541
Time after time,

25:05.625 --> 25:09.458
you have relied on treachery for survival,
just like everybody else.

25:09.541 --> 25:13.583
Because here is the real truth
that no one is willing tell you...

25:14.125 --> 25:18.375
There are no noble people in the world.

25:18.916 --> 25:19.916
Our parents.

25:20.250 --> 25:21.083
Ha...

25:23.291 --> 25:26.416
I see your parents never told you
about that night at the opera,

25:26.500 --> 25:28.333
and that box of poison darts.

25:29.041 --> 25:29.875
[sniffs]

25:32.416 --> 25:33.333
Your Honor,

25:33.416 --> 25:36.041
I call Esmé Squalor to the stand.

25:37.625 --> 25:38.458
Name.

25:38.541 --> 25:41.208
Esmé Gigi Geniveve Squalor.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.416
Occupation?
Single.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.208
Legally, we're still married!

25:45.291 --> 25:46.875
Single and loving it.

25:46.958 --> 25:48.583
Argh!

25:49.125 --> 25:51.250
Fabulously rich. Insanely attractive.

25:51.333 --> 25:54.125
The city's fourth most important
financial adviser, or something.

25:54.208 --> 25:56.666
Sixth most important financial adviser.

25:57.541 --> 25:58.875
Sixth.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.625
-[gavel pounds]
-You're trying my patience.

26:01.833 --> 26:04.250
Try the sausages.
Aren't you adorable!

26:04.333 --> 26:05.875
They're definitely not poisoned.

26:05.958 --> 26:07.375
No further questions.

26:08.083 --> 26:09.875
You may cross-examine the witness.

26:10.958 --> 26:11.791
Well?

26:12.166 --> 26:14.208
Don't you have any burning questions?

26:14.291 --> 26:18.625
Any unsolved mysteries gnawing away
in those smarty-pants brains?

26:19.375 --> 26:20.208
Go ahead.

26:20.625 --> 26:21.916
It'll be fun.

26:25.708 --> 26:29.083
Ms. Squalor, ever since we met you, you've
been obsessed with a stolen sugar bowl.

26:29.166 --> 26:30.125
We want to know why.

26:31.458 --> 26:32.875
I thought you'd never ask.

26:33.625 --> 26:34.875
We were at the opera,

26:34.958 --> 26:39.250
and Beatrice was talking about morality,
or something.

26:41.083 --> 26:44.458
It's wrong. Something so valuable
shouldn't be in the hands of one person.

26:44.541 --> 26:47.125
Please, darling,
you can trust me to keep it safe.

26:47.208 --> 26:48.666
I'm rich and beautiful.

26:48.750 --> 26:49.583
Listen to me, Esmé.

26:49.666 --> 26:53.750
There are traitors within V.F.D.
who do not want to put out fires at all.

26:53.833 --> 26:56.958
A certain man with a beard but no hair,
a certain woman with hair but no beard.

26:57.041 --> 26:59.000
They think fire can solve
any problem in the world.

26:59.083 --> 27:01.916
[Beatrice] What if they get their hands
on Gregor Anwhistle's research?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.458
Or what if they recruit any volunteer

27:03.541 --> 27:05.958
who feels lost and vulnerable enough
to join them?

27:06.041 --> 27:07.791
We could be looking at a schism.

27:07.875 --> 27:09.833
You want a family one day.

27:09.916 --> 27:11.083
I do, too.

27:11.166 --> 27:13.875
Don't you want to raise your children
in a safer world?

27:13.958 --> 27:16.875
This sugar bowl is our only hope.
It can save lives.

27:16.958 --> 27:18.416
It completes my tea set.

27:27.583 --> 27:30.541
There's only one option left.
It's a wicked thing to do.

27:30.625 --> 27:32.666
For a noble reason.
What choice do we have?

27:35.708 --> 27:37.000
Here, Esmé.

27:37.416 --> 27:39.125
You don't want to miss
the penultimate scene.

27:39.208 --> 27:41.750
"Penultimate" is a word
meaning "next to last."

27:45.791 --> 27:47.833
Who sings in the middle of a duel?

27:47.916 --> 27:49.083
It is an opera.

27:49.166 --> 27:52.583
Well, I prefer my entertainment
without unmotivated musical numbers,

27:52.666 --> 27:54.750
but someday I may change that opinion.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.333
[splutters]

27:57.791 --> 27:59.500
[hoarsely] This tea needs more sugar.

28:02.750 --> 28:04.666
[screams]

28:08.375 --> 28:09.875
Thieves!

28:11.666 --> 28:12.958
Was that a poison dart?

28:13.041 --> 28:14.583
It's the season's "innest" weapon.

28:14.666 --> 28:17.125
One of my admirers
smuggled it to me at intermission.

28:17.875 --> 28:19.958
So did one of mine.
You'll never throw it.

28:20.041 --> 28:23.583
Your great gift, aside from your ability
to pull off dragonfly-themed couture,

28:23.666 --> 28:25.083
is your compassion.

28:25.458 --> 28:26.833
What is going on?

28:26.916 --> 28:28.916
Are we throwing darts?
That's more exciting than opera!

28:29.000 --> 28:31.833
We're all friends here.
Let's have a quiet, rational discussion.

28:31.916 --> 28:33.583
Friends don't steal sugar bowls.

28:34.166 --> 28:35.166
Everyone remain calm!

28:35.500 --> 28:36.666
-[dart hits]
-Oh!

28:37.791 --> 28:38.791
[gasps]

28:45.583 --> 28:46.583
Olaf...

28:56.916 --> 28:58.625
You!

28:59.375 --> 29:00.791
[screaming]

29:00.875 --> 29:01.875
[gavel pounding]

29:02.333 --> 29:03.375
Enough!

29:03.458 --> 29:05.083
This trial is about the Baudelaires,

29:05.166 --> 29:07.750
not some mysterious event
that happened in the past.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.833
Don't you want to know what happened next?

29:09.916 --> 29:10.916
What happened next?

29:11.500 --> 29:13.250
It was a slippery slope.

29:13.791 --> 29:16.541
The theft led to a murder,
which led to a schism,

29:16.625 --> 29:18.916
which led to two retracted
marriage proposals

29:19.000 --> 29:20.541
and a series of arsons.

29:20.791 --> 29:22.166
Friends became enemies,

29:22.250 --> 29:24.250
children became orphans,

29:24.333 --> 29:25.666
and all because of--

29:25.750 --> 29:28.458
[coughing]

29:31.708 --> 29:33.083
He should get that looked at.

29:33.166 --> 29:35.791
[coughing continues]

29:37.000 --> 29:38.625
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29:38.708 --> 29:39.916
Must be something I ate.

29:40.458 --> 29:42.041
Well, it can't be these sausages.

29:42.125 --> 29:44.791
That adorable little girl
swore they weren't poisoned.

29:44.875 --> 29:45.791
[splutters]

29:45.875 --> 29:47.708
[Violet] Carmelita.
The Medusoid Mycelium.

29:47.791 --> 29:49.291
Yes!

29:49.375 --> 29:51.791
Gasp for air and wail with anguish!

29:51.875 --> 29:53.583
A tingly sensation in your throats?

29:53.666 --> 29:56.166
That's the taste
of my tingly, sensational revenge

29:56.250 --> 30:00.166
which, like justice and sausages,
has been served cold!

30:01.166 --> 30:03.791
Everyone, Esmé Squalor poisoned you
with a deadly fungus

30:03.875 --> 30:05.083
called the Medusoid Mycelium!

30:05.166 --> 30:08.583
Even a single spore is deadly!
Horseradish is the only cure!

30:08.666 --> 30:10.083
How did you find the Mycelium?

30:10.166 --> 30:12.250
I hid that diving helmet
where it could never be found.

30:12.333 --> 30:13.583
I didn't find the Mycelium.

30:13.666 --> 30:16.208
Then why is everybody coughing?
It's probably the pepper.

30:16.291 --> 30:18.625
-[snickering]
-You mean to tell me

30:18.708 --> 30:22.458
that you had the opportunity
to poison this entire courtroom,

30:22.541 --> 30:25.500
and you served them
overly peppered sausages?

30:25.583 --> 30:27.416
Not just any sausages!

30:27.500 --> 30:29.208
The meat was dark and tough

30:29.291 --> 30:32.083
because it came from the darkest
and toughest of birds!

30:33.083 --> 30:36.541
You people humiliated me,
so I made you eat crow!

30:36.625 --> 30:39.000
-We've been eating crow?!
It tastes more like chicken.

30:39.083 --> 30:41.416
Yes! [wheezing]

30:41.500 --> 30:42.833
-Argh!
-[gavel pounds]

30:42.916 --> 30:44.708
Drink some water, everyone.

30:44.791 --> 30:46.791
[murmuring and coughing]

30:51.666 --> 30:54.375
The Court will deal with you later.
Sit down.

30:54.791 --> 30:56.166
Baudelaires, please take a seat.

30:56.250 --> 30:57.833
You, take a seat!

30:57.916 --> 31:02.666
Now, there'll be no more interruptions,
distractions, or side plots.

31:02.750 --> 31:07.000
Count Olaf, is there anything further
you'd like to say to the Court?

31:09.916 --> 31:12.208
Not in the form of a song.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.375
I'm innocent.
Very well.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.666
I'm so incredibly innocent

31:18.083 --> 31:20.375
that the word "innocent"
should be written on my face.

31:20.958 --> 31:24.333
The "i" would stand for "I'm innocent."

31:24.916 --> 31:29.083
The "n" would stand for "nothing wrong,"
which is what I've done.

31:29.625 --> 31:31.750
The "a" would stand for--

31:31.833 --> 31:35.000
-That's not how you spell innocent.
-I'm sure spelling doesn't count.

31:35.083 --> 31:36.166
Spelling counts.

31:36.791 --> 31:40.541
Well, then innocent
should be spelled O-L-A-F,

31:40.625 --> 31:42.250
because that is how I plead.

31:44.541 --> 31:45.583
[footsteps]

31:47.833 --> 31:48.833
[clears throat]

31:54.083 --> 31:55.000
I'm...

31:55.083 --> 31:57.333
I'm sorry, Baudelaires, but...

31:57.916 --> 32:01.666
my fellow judges want to know
how  you  plead.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.041
But we're not the ones on trial.

32:09.125 --> 32:10.750
This trial is for Count Olaf.

32:10.833 --> 32:12.791
I don't like it any more than you do,

32:12.875 --> 32:16.375
but in light of recent evidence,
I don't have a choice.

32:17.541 --> 32:19.291
How do you plead, Baudelaires?

32:21.541 --> 32:22.500
We're innocent.

32:22.583 --> 32:24.875
Are you sure you can say that,

32:24.958 --> 32:26.833
after everything we've heard?

32:29.583 --> 32:30.541
We're innocent.

32:32.791 --> 32:33.708
Enough.

32:36.125 --> 32:39.583
The judges will now convene
to reach a verdict.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.125
Baudelaires, please take your seats.

32:42.208 --> 32:45.083
Everyone, put your blindfolds back on.

32:48.333 --> 32:49.583
You, too, Baudelaires.

32:50.041 --> 32:51.416
I don't want to put a blindfold on.

32:51.500 --> 32:54.416
We have to put our blindfolds on
if we want to see justice served.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.541
If we put blindfolds on,
we won't see anything at all.

32:56.625 --> 32:59.041
You don't have to put your blindfold on.
I'll do it for you.

32:59.125 --> 32:59.958
Please don't.

33:00.208 --> 33:01.458
Stop. I have my

33:07.083 --> 33:09.000
No!
Justice Strauss?

33:09.083 --> 33:10.958
[man] Justice Strauss
cannot reply right now.

33:11.041 --> 33:13.125
She's concentrating very deeply
on this case.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.958
-[yelps]
-[woman] Justice Strauss is fine.

33:15.041 --> 33:18.750
She made that noise because she's enjoying
a delicious piece of saltwater taffy.

33:18.833 --> 33:20.625
Those voices sound familiar.
We have to look.

33:20.708 --> 33:23.375
-We'll be in contempt of court.
-Maybe this court deserves contempt.

33:25.333 --> 33:27.458
[woman] The Baudelaires have taken off
their blindfolds!

33:27.541 --> 33:28.833
They're guilty of contempt of court.

33:28.916 --> 33:31.250
We certainly are!
This court is worthless and dishonorable!

33:31.333 --> 33:33.416
Two of those judges
are working with Count Olaf!

33:33.500 --> 33:35.125
That's absurd.
Justice Strauss can tell you

33:35.208 --> 33:37.166
we've served on the High Court
for many years.

33:37.250 --> 33:40.250
Although she can't tell you that now
because she's just taken a vow of silence.

33:40.333 --> 33:42.333
Justice Strauss, those judges are--

33:42.416 --> 33:45.958
Everyone, take off your blindfolds!
Count Olaf has kidnapped Justice Strauss!

33:46.041 --> 33:48.083
Those brats are liars! That's the truth!

33:48.166 --> 33:51.250
I believe them!
They've experienced villainy before!

33:51.333 --> 33:53.083
I don't! They're nothing but trouble!

33:53.166 --> 33:55.083
They're telling the truth!
Unless they're lying!

33:55.166 --> 33:56.125
They're murderers!

33:56.208 --> 33:57.375
They're cakesniffers!

33:57.458 --> 33:58.833
They're brave, like their mother!

33:58.916 --> 34:00.583
They're orphans, like their father!

34:00.666 --> 34:02.208
They're guilty!
They're innocent!

34:02.291 --> 34:03.291
They're hypnotized!

34:03.375 --> 34:05.375
They're real big fans of Herman Melville!

34:05.458 --> 34:06.958
[man] Anyone taking off their blindfold

34:07.041 --> 34:08.416
will be arrested by the authorities.

34:08.500 --> 34:11.208
You can't trust the authorities.
[woman] They're escaping!

34:11.291 --> 34:13.916
The Baudelaires are running
to the elevator! Capture them!

34:16.750 --> 34:17.750
Going down?

34:17.833 --> 34:19.583
We're going wherever you're going.

34:20.541 --> 34:22.958
-I'm going to the laundry room.
-[bell dings]

34:23.666 --> 34:25.333
[laughs wickedly]

34:25.416 --> 34:26.291
[bell dings]

34:26.375 --> 34:28.083
I have to retrieve the sugar bowl,

34:28.166 --> 34:30.750
then I'm going up to the roof
to retrieve the Medusoid Mycelium,

34:30.833 --> 34:33.000
then I'm going down to the lobby
to poison everyone,

34:33.083 --> 34:35.416
then I'm going back up to the roof
to escape the authorities.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.791
It's a lot of ups and downs,
but hey, so is life.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.833
You can't retrieve the sugar bowl
without the code.

34:39.916 --> 34:42.041
Sure you can.
This hotel is like a library,

34:42.125 --> 34:44.750
and you can find anything in a library
if you have one thing.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.708
A catalog?
A hostage.

34:47.333 --> 34:50.208
I found these clues to the code
on that waiter that I boiled,

34:50.291 --> 34:52.875
and I'm sure the answers
are in that black book of yours.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.583
Tell me, or eat harpoon!
Never!

34:55.666 --> 34:57.791
Baudelaires, help me
overpower this villain

34:57.875 --> 35:00.750
and bring him to the lobby
so justice can be served!

35:00.833 --> 35:03.500
The other judges are his associates.
They'll never put him in jail.

35:03.583 --> 35:04.750
But I've known them for years!

35:04.833 --> 35:07.666
They've always been very interested
whenever I've mentioned you children.

35:07.750 --> 35:10.958
Of course they are, you fool!
They're on my side of the schism!

35:11.041 --> 35:12.958
That trial was rigged from the start.

35:13.041 --> 35:15.375
I failed you again, Baudelaires.

35:16.375 --> 35:19.916
You will fail me
if you don't help me open the lock.

35:20.000 --> 35:24.166
The first clue is the medical condition
all three Baudelaires share.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.166
-Well?
-[moans]

35:27.250 --> 35:30.000
We're allergic to peppermints.
Klaus, what are you doing?

35:30.083 --> 35:33.208
Every noble person has failed us.
Why should we protect the sugar bowl?

35:33.291 --> 35:34.291
[sighs]

35:38.291 --> 35:41.125
All right! Get out of my way!
I know the answer to the next question.

35:41.208 --> 35:42.708
P-O-Y--

35:42.791 --> 35:44.583
Those letters don't spell anything.

35:44.666 --> 35:46.208
Spelling doesn't count.
Yes, it does!

35:46.583 --> 35:48.500
Tell me the phrase and I'll type it in.
Fine.

35:48.958 --> 35:52.291
The second phrase is the weapon
that left me an orphan.

35:53.458 --> 35:55.125
From that night at the opera.

35:55.208 --> 35:56.125
Poison dart.

35:56.208 --> 35:57.041
Yes.

35:57.416 --> 35:58.375
Type it in!

36:01.250 --> 36:03.416
The sugar bowl is so close I can taste it!

36:04.000 --> 36:07.708
The third clue is the famous
unfathomable question

36:07.791 --> 36:10.750
in the best-known novel by Richard Wright.

36:10.833 --> 36:12.125
That's an interesting question.

36:12.208 --> 36:13.958
No one cares!

36:14.041 --> 36:15.291
Type it in!

36:15.583 --> 36:16.875
Klaus, why are you doing this?

36:16.958 --> 36:17.791
Because...

36:21.416 --> 36:23.958
-The sugar bowl isn't in the laundry room.
-[gasps]

36:24.041 --> 36:25.041
Of course it's here.

36:25.125 --> 36:28.291
I saw that crow get shot
and the sugar bowl fall into the vent.

36:29.916 --> 36:31.875
[Klaus] That vent doesn't lead
to the laundry room.

36:31.958 --> 36:33.458
Dewey was right. The lock is a decoy.

36:33.916 --> 36:35.041
Then where is it?

36:35.125 --> 36:36.916
That secret died with Dewey Denouement.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.875
Then I guess he's not the only volunteer
who will die today.

36:40.333 --> 36:43.041
If I can't get what I want,
then nobody will.

36:43.125 --> 36:47.833
I'll unleash the Medusoid Mycelium
and destroy every soul in this hotel!

36:47.916 --> 36:51.416
Those volunteers never thought
I was noble enough. I'll show them!

36:51.500 --> 36:54.958
Those judges never thought I was
wicked enough. I'll show them, too!

36:55.041 --> 36:57.958
I will get my revenge on everyone,

36:58.041 --> 37:03.500
and volunteers and villains alike
will perish in anguish!

37:03.583 --> 37:05.500
You'll die with them.
Oh, no.

37:05.583 --> 37:09.625
I'll just push the  Carmelita II
off the roof and sail away.

37:09.708 --> 37:11.500
You can't sail a boat
off a tenstory building.

37:11.583 --> 37:13.541
The force of gravity
would smash it to pieces!

37:13.625 --> 37:17.000
Well, then, I suppose I'll add gravity
to my list of enemies.

37:17.083 --> 37:19.458
I'll get the boat off the roof.
Violet, no!

37:19.541 --> 37:20.541
What are you doing?

37:20.625 --> 37:23.375
Nobody's safe as long as Count Olaf's
here. We have to get him far away.

37:23.458 --> 37:24.458
Let's go!

37:24.833 --> 37:27.125
It's time to poison this hotel.

37:29.166 --> 37:30.458
What did the little brat say?

37:30.541 --> 37:32.833
She said, "Burn down hotel."
Sunny, no!

37:32.916 --> 37:36.125
The littlest orphan
is following in my footsteps!

37:36.208 --> 37:38.250
I was a good guardian after all!

37:38.333 --> 37:41.250
You were a terrible guardian!
Sunny doesn't know what she's saying.

37:42.791 --> 37:43.625
[laughs]

37:43.708 --> 37:47.250
I was so busy planning revenge
I forgot to take time for my hobbies.

37:47.333 --> 37:50.041
I'll just pour those flammable chemicals
onto those sheets.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.958
What are you doing?
Innocent people will get hurt.

37:57.500 --> 38:00.291
Sunny's right. If we warn people
about the fungus, they might not listen.

38:00.375 --> 38:02.000
They never listen,
but if there's a fire...

38:02.083 --> 38:04.041
-They might evacuate the building.
-And be safe.

38:05.416 --> 38:07.125
You'll never get away with this!

38:07.208 --> 38:10.000
I have all the evidence of your treachery
right here!

38:10.708 --> 38:11.916
[Strauss moans]

38:12.708 --> 38:14.375
[Strauss gasps, moans]

38:14.875 --> 38:16.416
Thanks for the kindling.

38:30.166 --> 38:33.833
Time to unleash a deadly fungus.

38:38.333 --> 38:39.625
[Strauss moans]

38:39.708 --> 38:41.666
I hope you know what you're doing,
Baudelaires.

38:41.750 --> 38:43.500
-[Olaf growls]
-[Strauss gasps]

38:43.583 --> 38:44.916
What are you doing, Baudelaires?

38:45.000 --> 38:49.041
If we stop on every floor, I'll never
reach the roof in time to poison everyone!

38:49.125 --> 38:52.333
That's brilliant! If we stop
on every floor, we can warn everyone!

38:52.416 --> 38:53.750
And save all these people.

38:54.250 --> 38:56.291
Only the ones who will believe you.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
[bell dings]

39:00.625 --> 39:02.250
The hotel is on fire!

39:02.333 --> 39:05.291
A fire? Olaf, you're finally thinking big.

39:05.375 --> 39:07.541
There's no fire.
The Baudelaires are trying to trick you!

39:07.625 --> 39:09.708
Whatever you do, stay where you are!

39:09.791 --> 39:11.541
We're not lying!
Can't you smell the smoke?

39:11.625 --> 39:14.291
That's from the barbecue
for the cocktail party!

39:14.375 --> 39:17.000
Typical Olaf. Throwing a party
instead of starting a fire.

39:17.083 --> 39:19.708
And after we tried so hard
to set a bad example.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.916
You have disappointed us
for the last time.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.291
I certainly have.

39:23.958 --> 39:26.458
You're a disgrace to the legal profession!

39:27.041 --> 39:28.166
[bell dings]

39:28.250 --> 39:29.125
[Strauss moans]

39:29.208 --> 39:30.041
Fire! Fire!

39:30.125 --> 39:30.958
Argh!

39:31.041 --> 39:34.166
Klaus? You shouldn't add false reporting
to your list of crimes.

39:34.250 --> 39:36.250
Next, they'll be saying
Count Olaf is here!

39:36.333 --> 39:37.791
Count Olaf  is  here!

39:37.875 --> 39:40.708
There really is a fire! You have to leave!

39:40.791 --> 39:43.875
Follow me. I'm such a genius,
I'll find the exit blindfolded.

39:43.958 --> 39:45.875
It's like the blind leading the blind.

39:46.375 --> 39:47.666
I've got you, sir.

39:50.041 --> 39:51.041
[bell dings]

39:51.125 --> 39:53.333
Fire!
Fire? Oh, no! No, no, no!

39:53.416 --> 39:55.958
I think the stairs are this way!
I think the stairs are that way!

39:56.041 --> 39:58.833
I don't like to argue.
Let's compromise and just stand here.

40:00.625 --> 40:01.666
[bell dings]

40:01.750 --> 40:04.208
Esmé, Carmelita, the hotel is on fire.
You have to get out!

40:04.291 --> 40:05.791
Why should we listen to cakesniffers?

40:05.875 --> 40:08.708
She's right. You orphans are as dishonest
as my ex-boyfriend.

40:08.791 --> 40:12.541
No, seriously, it's a big fire. I swear.

40:12.625 --> 40:16.541
Also, the sugar bowl is definitely
not down in the laundry room.

40:16.625 --> 40:19.541
He's lying. We'll take the stairs
to the laundry room and grab it ourselves!

40:19.625 --> 40:22.000
At last, the sugar bowl is mine!

40:22.083 --> 40:23.083
[bell dings]

40:26.708 --> 40:30.083
Well, this wasn't my intention,
but at least we got to start a fire.

40:35.708 --> 40:37.791
The fire isn't burning quickly.
People will escape.

40:37.875 --> 40:41.166
It isn't burning slowly either.
What if some people don't?

40:41.250 --> 40:44.500
I'll save the Medusoid Mycelium
for a rainy day.

40:44.583 --> 40:46.916
If we didn't do something,
Olaf would have poisoned everyone.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.875
-What choice did we have?
-[crashing]

40:50.291 --> 40:53.333
The fire is weakening the structural
integrity of the building. We have to go.

40:53.416 --> 40:54.750
Klaus, help me pull this down.

40:54.833 --> 40:57.083
Attach it to the oarlocks
with the Devil's Tongue knot

40:57.166 --> 40:58.041
and make a drag chute.

40:58.125 --> 40:59.000
[Strauss] Baudelaires,

40:59.083 --> 41:02.500
I know it seems like running from the law
is the answer, but it won't help.

41:02.583 --> 41:05.083
Why, when I was your age, I spent years

41:05.166 --> 41:07.250
-as a horse thief before--
-We're running out of time!

41:07.333 --> 41:08.833
Klaus, Sunny, help me tie this off.

41:08.916 --> 41:10.125
I'll stand here and supervise.

41:10.208 --> 41:12.500
Push the boat to the edge of the roof,
or we'll all die.

41:13.291 --> 41:14.416
Fine.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.833
[straining]

41:17.666 --> 41:20.291
Justice Strauss, come with us.
No, it isn't right!

41:20.375 --> 41:22.416
You can't run from the scene of a crime.

41:22.500 --> 41:26.125
Come with me, and we'll explain
everything to the authorities.

41:26.208 --> 41:27.208
They might not believe us.

41:27.291 --> 41:29.166
Or they might be enemies.
Look at the High Court.

41:29.250 --> 41:32.750
That's no excuse for running away!

41:32.833 --> 41:37.208
Justice Strauss, the law
isn't always just. It isn't always good.

41:37.291 --> 41:38.291
That may be so,

41:38.375 --> 41:41.000
but I can still give you a home.

41:41.083 --> 41:42.833
I can keep you safe.

41:42.916 --> 41:47.000
I've been following you for so long,
and you've always been out of my grasp,

41:47.083 --> 41:48.625
but I have you now,

41:48.708 --> 41:50.625
and I won't let you go.

41:51.916 --> 41:52.833
We're sorry.

It's a terrible fire.

42:32.583 --> 42:33.916
At least if any volunteers see it,

42:34.000 --> 42:36.416
they'll know that the Last Safe Place
isn't safe anymore.

42:36.500 --> 42:38.625
Oh, they'll know more than that.

42:39.041 --> 42:40.750
They'll know that I've won,

42:40.833 --> 42:42.750
that treachery has triumphed,

42:42.833 --> 42:47.458
and that the Baudelaire orphans
are in my clutches at last.

[laughs wickedly]

42:54.250 --> 42:58.458
[laughing continues]

43:01.000 --> 43:03.916
[Lemony]  Since devoting my life
to the case of the Baudelaires,

43:04.000 --> 43:06.250
there are many mysteries
I have yet to solve.

43:07.791 --> 43:10.833
I have yet to learn the final
resting place of the sugar bowl,

43:11.875 --> 43:14.833
though I have a theory
involving a secret sub-basement

43:14.916 --> 43:17.541
and a mail chute disguised
as a laundry vent.

43:17.958 --> 43:19.500
I have yet to learn why my sister

43:19.583 --> 43:22.416
did not return to the Hotel Denouement,
as promised.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.291
[crashing]

43:24.375 --> 43:25.916
Though I fear the worst.

43:27.708 --> 43:31.791
However, I have learned the answer
to the famous unfathomable question

43:31.875 --> 43:34.916
in the best-known novel
by Richard Wright which asks,

43:36.333 --> 43:38.666
"Who knows when some slight shock,

43:38.750 --> 43:43.000
disturbing the delicate balance between
social order and thirsty aspiration,

43:43.083 --> 43:46.125
shall send the skyscrapers
in our cities toppling?"

43:47.500 --> 43:49.541
What this means is that a small event,

43:49.625 --> 43:53.083
like a man failing to give three children
a ride in his taxi,

43:53.166 --> 43:55.041
could ripple and tremble,

43:55.125 --> 43:57.166
and bring down a building.

44:03.250 --> 44:05.708
Have you seen Violet, Klaus,
and Sunny Baudelaire?

44:06.416 --> 44:07.416
They're gone.

44:08.666 --> 44:10.875
I've traveled everywhere they've been,

44:10.958 --> 44:13.416
I've investigated
everything they've been through,

44:13.500 --> 44:15.958
and now it's all gone up in flames.

44:16.541 --> 44:19.708
The only thing left
of  The Complete History of Injustice...

44:21.125 --> 44:22.458
is this photograph.

44:26.500 --> 44:27.666
[Strauss] Those poor children.

44:27.750 --> 44:30.125
If only someone could have protected them.

44:32.166 --> 44:33.666
Would you mind if I kept this?

44:34.166 --> 44:36.166
It's too painful to hold on to,

44:36.750 --> 44:39.458
although I can't imagine
you'd have any use for it.

44:50.375 --> 44:52.750
This is not the story of Lemony Snicket.

44:54.541 --> 44:57.666
But if it were,
I would tell you about a man, a woman,

44:57.750 --> 45:01.208
and a terrible crime
that happened one night at the opera.

45:01.291 --> 45:03.916
I have to tell them the truth.
I threw the dart, not you.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.125
It's my fault.
It was my idea to steal the sugar bowl.

45:06.208 --> 45:09.166
I won't let you trade your life for mine.
Your life is worth more.

45:10.416 --> 45:13.375
[man whistling]

45:14.208 --> 45:15.208
Beatrice...

45:15.541 --> 45:17.333
I will love you if I never see you again,

45:17.416 --> 45:20.083
and I will love you
if I see you every Tuesday.

45:20.166 --> 45:22.333
I will love you
as the iceberg loves the ship,

45:22.416 --> 45:24.833
and as the passengers love the lifeboat,

45:24.916 --> 45:27.083
and as the battlefield loves young men,

45:27.166 --> 45:29.041
and as peppermints love your allergies.

45:29.666 --> 45:32.583
I will love you as we grow older,
which just happened and happened again,

45:32.666 --> 45:33.750
and will continue to happen.

45:33.833 --> 45:38.291
I will love you until every fire has been
extinguished and every home rebuilt,

45:38.375 --> 45:40.541
and every code and heart has been broken.

45:41.708 --> 45:43.458
I will love you if you marry someone else,

45:43.541 --> 45:45.500
and I will love you if have a child,

45:45.583 --> 45:48.541
or two children, or three.
Seems like a good number.

45:51.958 --> 45:53.291
I love you, Beatrice.

45:54.458 --> 45:55.666
I always will.

45:56.416 --> 45:58.500
You've always had a way with words.

45:59.083 --> 46:00.041
[man] He's over there!

46:02.625 --> 46:03.708
Please stay.

[bell dings]

46:09.125 --> 46:11.375
The story of Lemony Snicket
would be a sad account

46:11.458 --> 46:14.500
of the brave men and women
who formed a secret organization

46:14.583 --> 46:16.083
with noble intentions,

46:16.708 --> 46:18.750
only to find it wrecked by a schism,

46:18.833 --> 46:22.500
a series of fires,
and their own tragic mistakes.

46:22.583 --> 46:24.291
Beatrice will pay for this.

46:24.375 --> 46:25.375
Oh, no.

46:26.291 --> 46:27.833
She'll burn.

46:33.083 --> 46:36.250
The story of Lemony Snicket
would be long and lonely

46:36.333 --> 46:37.875
and incomplete.

46:38.541 --> 46:40.041
But this is not that story.

46:43.791 --> 46:46.458
This is the story
of the Baudelaire orphans...

46:47.208 --> 46:49.250
and I am merely the person telling it.

46:50.250 --> 46:51.750
My name is Lemony Snicket,

46:52.958 --> 46:57.791
and it is my solemn duty to investigate
the lives of the Baudelaire orphans...

46:58.333 --> 46:59.500
because if I do...

47:00.958 --> 47:03.333
