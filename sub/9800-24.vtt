00:13.824 --> 00:17.594
I am now approaching the reptile house.

00:18.145 --> 00:20.327
Roger that, Alice, just be careful.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.509
I am being careful.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.011
I am being extra super...

00:26.778 --> 00:27.726
Careful.

00:28.472 --> 00:30.437
Very... careful.

00:31.109 --> 00:31.902
Hey, what's going on?

00:32.079 --> 00:33.774
Intel is sketchy.

00:33.854 --> 00:36.789
All we know is, we've got
a transfer from the Hoboken zoo.

00:36.983 --> 00:40.713
I am now entering the reptile house.

00:41.638 --> 00:45.173
I am now releasing the subject.

00:48.378 --> 00:52.566
I am now getting my sweet 
patootie out of here! 

00:54.136 --> 00:56.384
This warrants further investigation.

01:02.154 --> 01:03.256
What's in there?

01:18.818 --> 01:21.737
Oh my gosh, he's just a bundle of precious.

01:21.817 --> 01:25.703
Oh, he is the cutest thing
my eyes have ever seen.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.766
Cuter than me?

01:32.403 --> 01:33.673
Hello, little friend.

01:33.753 --> 01:36.018
Welcome to the zoo. I'm...

01:36.529 --> 01:38.804
Oh dear. I don't think
he can hear me.

01:43.542 --> 01:45.499
Oh, and I think he's scared.

01:47.783 --> 01:48.920
Lock-pop ladder, go.

01:53.462 --> 01:56.345
Now, my little friend,
as I was saying, I'm...

01:56.927 --> 01:57.976
Annoying.

01:58.752 --> 01:59.898
Get my lunch.

02:00.233 --> 02:02.887
Flyes, lightly sauteed. 
Thank you.

02:09.846 --> 02:11.936
A cute froggy, he is funny.

02:12.016 --> 02:14.201
Yeah, a real cut-up.

02:16.123 --> 02:18.134
It's Hoboken all over again.

02:18.565 --> 02:20.747
Listen, my name is Barry,

02:20.827 --> 02:23.769
and you all work for me now, everyone.

02:23.849 --> 02:27.655
You do what I say when I say it.

02:28.744 --> 02:31.865
Have you ever heard a more adorable tirade?

02:31.945 --> 02:34.211
I just want to scoop him up
and give him a great big hug.

02:34.291 --> 02:37.014
Trust me, lady, I'm not the hugging type,

02:37.094 --> 02:40.576
I'm the "do what I say or
I'll ruin your life" type.

02:40.656 --> 02:42.304
Or really, little hoppy?

02:42.384 --> 02:44.252
And how are you going to do that? 

02:45.557 --> 02:47.038
Oh, like this.

02:54.838 --> 02:57.192
Oh, that never gets old,
that never gets old.

02:58.232 --> 02:59.660
What's wrong with Rico?

02:59.740 --> 03:01.009
Toxins.

03:01.089 --> 03:06.277
According to scratch-and-sniff rainforest
animals Barry is a poison dart frog.

03:07.336 --> 03:10.352
His skin is drenched
in paralyzing poisons.

03:10.432 --> 03:13.156
So nobody can touch Berry, ever?

03:13.236 --> 03:16.277
I guess, he really isn't 
the hugging type. How sad.

03:16.357 --> 03:19.176
Yeah, boo hoo.
How long till Rico is back to normal?

03:19.855 --> 03:21.927
Rico normal or normal normal?

03:22.659 --> 03:23.647
Rico normal.

03:23.990 --> 03:25.012
It could be days.

03:25.092 --> 03:26.608
Then I just have one question.

03:26.820 --> 03:29.359
Why does the peruvian booby smell like armpit?

03:31.034 --> 03:31.934
No.

03:32.091 --> 03:34.146
How do we fight an enemy we can't touch?

03:34.226 --> 03:37.170
Skipper, maybe we don't
need to fight him at all.

03:41.494 --> 03:42.904
Hey, monkeys.

03:45.029 --> 03:47.789
Monkeys have tails. We aren't.

03:47.869 --> 03:50.884
Giving me lip when you
should be giving me bananas.

03:52.643 --> 03:54.671
Are we going to  have a problem here?

03:54.751 --> 03:58.480
Do I need to break out the toxic touch?

03:58.833 --> 04:00.446
No, take them.
Take them all.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.436
I do not like this telling
other animals what to do.

04:06.709 --> 04:08.817
That is my niche.

04:09.046 --> 04:11.021
Yo, elephant.

04:11.258 --> 04:12.201
Gah!

04:18.250 --> 04:19.925
Not a good idea.

04:20.005 --> 04:23.424
Now get over there and
suck up those bananas, now!

04:27.946 --> 04:29.154
Now blow.

04:34.693 --> 04:36.730
Okay, but I do like that. Look at it.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.075
I mean, you got to respect and creativity.

04:41.605 --> 04:44.717
Hey, what's the matter with you two?
This is hilarious.

04:46.013 --> 04:48.138
I demand you laugh with me.

04:52.122 --> 04:54.794
We are not amused, tiny amphibian.

04:55.111 --> 04:56.354
Sorry, Barry.

04:56.434 --> 04:59.466
I know your bullying is just
a desperate cry for attention.

04:59.546 --> 05:02.358
Ah, don't mollycoddle the prisoner, Private.

05:02.438 --> 05:04.624
He is getting what he deserves.

05:04.704 --> 05:07.631
If there's one thing I cannot 
stand, it's a bully.

05:07.808 --> 05:11.599
When one animal makes it his business
to infringe on the freedom of others,

05:11.679 --> 05:14.856
I make it my business to take
that punk down a notch.

05:14.936 --> 05:16.910
Or eight. Right, Kowalski?

05:16.990 --> 05:18.444
Right. And...

05:21.865 --> 05:24.669
Oh, come on, step up your game, birds.

05:24.749 --> 05:26.954
I'm already up two-zip.

05:31.609 --> 05:34.290
Our situation is rapidly deteriorating.

05:34.370 --> 05:35.727
What do we do, Skipper?

05:35.807 --> 05:38.522
Well, Kowalski's been
working on a secret project.

05:38.680 --> 05:41.749
It's untested, 
perhaps even dangerous.

05:51.325 --> 05:54.816
Private, prepare yourself for
what you are about to see.

05:57.567 --> 05:58.907
Is... Is that?..

05:59.207 --> 06:01.552
Yes, Private, it is.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.175
A six-foot whacking stick.

06:05.387 --> 06:07.653
Berry will never know what hit him.

06:07.733 --> 06:08.358
Skipper.

06:08.649 --> 06:10.563
Isn't there a less violent solution?

06:10.643 --> 06:11.963
There should, probably.

06:12.043 --> 06:13.797
But I want to see what this baby can do.

06:17.667 --> 06:20.858
Oh, countess, your tea is delicious.

06:20.938 --> 06:22.304
Thank you, lady Dashwood.

06:22.384 --> 06:24.743
Would you care for another crumpet or whatnot? 

06:25.404 --> 06:26.171
"Crumpet".

06:28.949 --> 06:30.985
I know, I know, dance a waltz.

06:31.602 --> 06:33.480
Excuse me, cute froggy.

06:33.647 --> 06:35.454
You seem to be confused.

06:35.675 --> 06:39.193
I am the one who is to be telling 
the animals what to do.

06:40.656 --> 06:43.346
Yes! This is because I am King.

06:44.849 --> 06:47.441
The bossingness is what I do.

06:47.679 --> 06:51.118
However, if you are interested,
you may apply for an internship.

06:52.201 --> 06:55.560
We are currently accepting 
applications for the spring semester.

06:57.703 --> 07:00.947
But until you have properly internalised,

07:01.149 --> 07:03.213
you must cease the bossing around.

07:04.103 --> 07:04.879
You know what?

07:04.959 --> 07:06.290
Cease this.

07:18.919 --> 07:21.741
This madness ends now, punk.

07:22.790 --> 07:26.096
Are you now going to pummel him
until he is all squishy?

07:26.176 --> 07:27.190
That's the idea.

07:27.418 --> 07:30.795
Yes! I am King Julien 
and I approve this plan.

07:40.915 --> 07:41.524
Where'd he go?

07:41.973 --> 07:43.349
I... I don't know, Skipper.

07:49.207 --> 07:50.688
Get off, get off, get off.

07:51.129 --> 07:51.905
Evac!

07:51.985 --> 07:53.907
Come on, let's play.

08:05.349 --> 08:06.222
All clear.

08:08.918 --> 08:09.562
Again.

08:12.224 --> 08:13.864
Nooo!

08:13.944 --> 08:16.342
Yeees! Three-zip.

08:16.422 --> 08:18.000
And you're next.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.712
How do you touch someone 
who's untouchable?

08:25.418 --> 08:26.670
It is a riddle.

08:26.846 --> 08:29.262
Like what do you eat first, 
the chicken or the egg.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.772
I said the egg, 'cause 
they are breakfast foods.

08:31.852 --> 08:33.253
That's not the way it goes.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.731
So you think, the chicken first, huh?

08:35.811 --> 08:38.464
Oh, it does make a nice base for the eggs.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.395
No, that's not...

08:40.995 --> 08:43.993
Mort, will you keep it down?
We are trying to think here.

08:44.073 --> 08:45.457
I like beans.

08:48.912 --> 08:51.002
Mort, who can be dealing with you?

08:51.082 --> 08:52.668
Stay in that can.

08:52.748 --> 08:54.150
That's it.

09:16.833 --> 09:19.240
Oh, who can save us?

09:32.277 --> 09:35.081
Penguin, it's time you and me got...

09:35.161 --> 09:36.500
in touch.

09:36.825 --> 09:37.945
Take this.

09:40.370 --> 09:41.392
Or this.

09:42.195 --> 09:43.279
Or this.

09:45.283 --> 09:46.994
Hey, I can't...

09:47.074 --> 09:50.124
You can't touch me,
but I can touch you.

09:51.182 --> 09:52.398
Stay away from me.

09:56.812 --> 10:00.338
Berry, I'm going to do to you
what no one else ever has.

10:00.418 --> 10:01.890
No. No!

10:01.970 --> 10:03.133
Give you a big hug.

10:03.213 --> 10:04.094
Huh? What?

10:04.500 --> 10:07.110
I'd be a grumpy gus too 
if no one ever hugged me.

10:07.293 --> 10:08.845
Hey, you know what?

10:09.515 --> 10:11.146
I never have been hugged.

10:12.636 --> 10:14.603
Maybe this is just what I needed.

10:15.941 --> 10:20.191
Or maybe I'm just a jerk who 
enjoys bullying other animals.

10:20.794 --> 10:23.333
Within that case, I can just squeeze 
you till you pop like a grape.

10:23.413 --> 10:24.991
No, no, go with the hug.
The hug's good.

10:25.335 --> 10:26.490
Actually...

10:27.185 --> 10:28.614
I'm liking the hug.

10:33.410 --> 10:34.935
How you feeling, Kowalski?

10:36.274 --> 10:38.496
I can taste sound.

10:38.787 --> 10:40.075
But that's passed.

10:40.155 --> 10:40.612
Rico?

10:43.125 --> 10:45.841
Well, the best thing for it 
is to get back on our feet.

10:47.453 --> 10:48.476
King me!

10:48.837 --> 10:50.019
Hey, guys.

10:50.513 --> 10:53.114
Anybody else seeing a robot penguin

10:53.194 --> 10:55.459
playing checkers with the poisonous frog?

10:56.826 --> 10:58.386
More rack time, boys.
