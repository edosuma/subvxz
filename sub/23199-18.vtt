00:36.036 --> 00:39.748
- Have you had enough?
- I guess table tennis is just my racket.

00:39.831 --> 00:42.042
You have a way with words.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.710
I've gotta go.

00:43.793 --> 00:47.213
I've got a new photojournalist
coming in this morning.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.299
Sgt. Diana Prince.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.719
She must be good.
Transferred from the Pentagon, no less.

00:52.802 --> 00:56.598
In that case, it won't do for you
to be late and set a bad example.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.225
I'll tell her I was unavoidably detained...

00:59.309 --> 01:02.103
by the most attractive man
in the United States Air Force.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.897
You have incredibly good taste.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.691
Maj. Cornell. Paging Maj. Cornell.

01:10.069 --> 01:11.362
Maj. Cornell.

01:13.031 --> 01:17.243
- Mary had a little lamb.
- Its fleece was white as snow.

01:18.536 --> 01:20.747
Is the snow falling, Major?

01:22.040 --> 01:23.916
The snow is falling.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.503
Good.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.548
Here are your instructions.

01:44.937 --> 01:46.939
Alan, what's the matter?

01:48.691 --> 01:50.401
Where are you going?

03:49.686 --> 03:52.772
Staff Sgt. Prince, Diana
reporting for duty, sir.

03:52.856 --> 03:54.816
Your orders, Sergeant?

04:02.157 --> 04:04.868
- A photojournalist, Sgt. Prince?
- Yes, sir.

04:06.077 --> 04:08.621
You are assigned
to the Public Information Office.

04:08.705 --> 04:11.416
- You know this base is on Yellow Alert?
- Yes, sir.

04:11.499 --> 04:15.044
- What's in the bag, Sergeant?
- Photographic equipment, sir.

04:15.128 --> 04:16.754
Open it, please.

04:26.889 --> 04:29.309
Since you're new,
let me give you a word of warning.

04:29.392 --> 04:32.478
Yellow Alert on this base
means security comes first.

04:32.603 --> 04:35.648
- Remember that when you're on duty.
- Yes, sir.

04:36.607 --> 04:38.301
Capt. Colby's office is
the first door on the left.

04:38.392 --> 04:40.850
I suggest you report there at once.

05:31.495 --> 05:34.707
- This is Catamaran, come in.
- This is Collector.

05:35.249 --> 05:39.003
- Are you safely at anchor?
- Affirmative. Awaiting instructions.

05:39.253 --> 05:43.507
Roger.
Switch to IADC Scrambler Channel 110.

05:43.841 --> 05:46.427
All further transmissions on that channel.

05:48.178 --> 05:49.430
Switching now.

06:01.024 --> 06:03.819
Now receiving on 110.

06:03.902 --> 06:05.946
Here's the situation up to now.

06:06.029 --> 06:09.408
As you know, San Remo is the hub
of a vital defense region.

06:09.616 --> 06:13.829
I've had agents working undercover
at all of the three other regional bases.

06:13.912 --> 06:16.039
Norris, McKinley and Lansdale.

06:16.123 --> 06:18.959
They've all reported
incidents of sabotage activity.

06:19.042 --> 06:22.713
It doesn't strike you little curious
that San Remo has been left untouched?

06:22.796 --> 06:24.965
It sure does. That's why you're there now.

06:25.048 --> 06:28.135
I've asked the base commander
to put the base on Yellow Alert...

06:28.218 --> 06:29.511
standby to go to Red.

06:29.594 --> 06:33.598
What you're saying is, you think
San Remo is next in line for sabotage?

06:34.099 --> 06:38.603
We both know our whole national space
effort rests with the success of the Z-400.

06:39.521 --> 06:43.066
With the test flight scheduled
for tomorrow, Washington to San Remo...

06:43.150 --> 06:46.361
our security performance
becomes very critical.

06:58.790 --> 07:03.128
Well, the cover you provided gives me
access to almost every area on the base.

07:03.211 --> 07:04.838
I'll keep my eyes wide open.

07:04.921 --> 07:08.091
- I'll be landing at the base shortly.
- As Steve Trevor?

07:08.383 --> 07:11.094
Well, as Lt. Col. Steve Trevor...

07:11.219 --> 07:14.848
on temporary duty to San Remo
from Systems Command Headquarters.

07:14.931 --> 07:18.017
Well, congratulations.
You finally got a promotion.

07:18.268 --> 07:20.478
Yeah, they don't cut my hair.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.961
I have to break transmission, Steve.

07:45.128 --> 07:48.381
I'll be touching doWn in practically
45 minutes. Contact me then.

07:48.464 --> 07:49.590
All right.

08:02.603 --> 08:06.607
- What were you doing in there, Sergeant?
- I was loading my camera, sir.

08:11.904 --> 08:14.991
- I heard voices.
- Voices?

08:17.243 --> 08:19.787
That must've been me singing.

08:19.870 --> 08:22.123
I had to figure some new words for songs.

08:22.206 --> 08:24.375
There are regulations
covering insubordination.

08:24.458 --> 08:27.336
It's not unknown for a girl
to wind up in the guardhouse.

08:27.420 --> 08:31.006
- What's going on here?
- Checking the security of your section.

08:31.090 --> 08:34.260
It sounded more
like you were pulling rank, Lieutenant.

08:35.928 --> 08:39.849
Sergeant, if you're who I think you are,
you've just had a long trip.

08:40.099 --> 08:41.517
Yes, I have.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.853
Welcome to the San Remo
Public Information Office, Sgt. Prince.

08:44.937 --> 08:46.021
Thank you.

08:46.105 --> 08:48.440
I think you can go now, Lieutenant.

08:49.858 --> 08:51.235
Just one moment.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.615
You see these tracks on my shoulder?

08:56.699 --> 09:00.744
That shows that I'm a Captain,
and you're a Second Lieutenant.

09:00.828 --> 09:04.623
I think you'd better learn
to recognize the difference, Lieutenant.

09:04.873 --> 09:05.999
That's all.

09:13.799 --> 09:17.386
With the kind of day I've had,
that bit of comic relief was welcome.

09:17.469 --> 09:18.971
He goes a bit too far.

09:19.054 --> 09:22.391
Well, with this Yellow Alert,
I think it's understandable.

09:22.683 --> 09:24.851
The first thing is to get you settled in.

09:24.935 --> 09:27.062
I got you a room at the NCO quarters.

09:27.145 --> 09:29.564
And your first assignment
should be a lot of fun.

09:29.648 --> 09:33.902
The Hull City Howlers, the rock group
are performing at the base tonight.

09:33.986 --> 09:36.738
And you'll be covering their arrival
and the concert.

09:36.822 --> 09:39.324
- May I take that for you?
- Thank you, Captain.

09:39.408 --> 09:42.494
In this section,
we don't stand too much on formality.

09:42.577 --> 09:46.289
- Just call me sir.
- All right, sir. After you.

09:46.957 --> 09:48.625
No. After you.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.076
- Good enough. Pretty good.
- Nice place you guys got here.

10:23.159 --> 10:25.620
- All right, Mitch.
- All right. Take care.

10:26.121 --> 10:29.332
- This bus is...
- Yeah. Far out. Everyone says that.

10:29.415 --> 10:31.000
Couldn't have put it better myself.

10:31.084 --> 10:34.379
- Mind if I take a picture inside?
- Sure. Come into my parlor.

10:34.462 --> 10:35.588
I'll give you the tour.

10:45.098 --> 10:46.224
Speak.

10:46.307 --> 10:49.394
You said you wanted to know
if anything unusual happened.

10:49.477 --> 10:51.854
I picked up an unauthorized transmission.

10:51.938 --> 10:54.982
Before it was scrambled,
the IADC was mentioned.

10:55.066 --> 10:56.734
IADC?

10:56.984 --> 10:59.112
Did you decode any of the transmission?

10:59.195 --> 11:01.447
No, but I did pinpoint the receiver.

11:01.989 --> 11:05.660
Take a look
at your visitor with the camera. It's her.

11:06.661 --> 11:09.664
Her name is Diana Prince.

11:15.503 --> 11:16.879
Thank you, Major.

11:18.506 --> 11:20.508
Now you will wake up...

11:20.675 --> 11:23.886
and not remember
any conversation since this morning.

11:41.195 --> 11:44.615
- Yeah. Listen. Thanks again.
- All right. Good. Look forward to it.

11:44.698 --> 11:45.783
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:47.326 --> 11:49.703
I see you're finding your way
around the base.

11:49.787 --> 11:52.248
Yes, thank you, Lieutenant.

11:52.331 --> 11:56.710
I suppose you thought that little scene
in Public Information was pretty funny.

11:56.794 --> 11:58.295
No, sir. I didn't.

11:58.379 --> 12:00.464
And you've been given
a top level clearance...

12:00.547 --> 12:02.299
that gives you the run of the base.

12:02.383 --> 12:05.177
Unusual for a newly arrived sergeant,
isn't it?

12:05.260 --> 12:07.888
Why don't you ask
Capt. Colby about that, sir?

12:34.247 --> 12:36.416
Do you mind if I take your picture?

12:38.543 --> 12:39.920
Hold this for me.

12:42.714 --> 12:43.882
Smile.

12:46.259 --> 12:47.594
Thank you, sir.

12:48.136 --> 12:50.430
Harmless-looking little sergeant.

12:55.852 --> 12:57.437
And she's very pretty.

12:59.105 --> 13:01.775
It's almost a pity you'll have to kill her.

13:09.449 --> 13:10.533
Sergeant.

13:12.827 --> 13:14.204
Sgt. Prince.

13:16.456 --> 13:19.626
There's something in here
you should have a picture of.

13:29.719 --> 13:30.804
Lieutenant?

13:30.887 --> 13:33.014
Sorry to disappoint you, Sergeant.

15:07.983 --> 15:09.109
All right.

15:09.193 --> 15:13.113
Now it's time for a little chat.
Why were you attacking Diana Prince?

15:13.447 --> 15:16.867
When the snow falls, I must obey.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.619
When the snow falls?

15:18.869 --> 15:22.456
What are you talking about?
It must be 80 degrees outside.

15:22.539 --> 15:24.917
Where do you get your weather reports?

15:25.000 --> 15:28.003
When the snow falls, I must obey.

15:34.009 --> 15:36.720
You're sure
there's nothing else you wanna say?

15:38.055 --> 15:40.390
I know. When the snow falls.

15:50.776 --> 15:54.404
- What am I doing here?
- I'm glad something rang a bell with you.

15:54.571 --> 15:57.574
- What am I doing here?
- You really don't know, do you?

15:57.657 --> 15:58.784
No.

15:59.826 --> 16:02.746
Well, that's what
the Air Police are gonna wanna find out.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.831
They're on their way here now.

17:13.733 --> 17:17.653
Steve, I hate to spoil your arrival
with this kind of news...

17:18.488 --> 17:22.200
but someone knows I'm an IADC agent
and wants me out of the way.

17:22.617 --> 17:24.785
When the snow falls, I must obey.

17:29.749 --> 17:33.169
You say you have no idea who the guys
were who tried to take you out?

17:33.252 --> 17:36.964
It's very strange. The one seemed
to be either drugged or hypnotized.

17:37.048 --> 17:41.010
He had no idea what he was doing
on the base. Claimed to be from Idaho.

17:41.093 --> 17:44.472
According to Washington, his story
checked out with the police there.

17:44.555 --> 17:47.057
Seems that he's an airman
who's been AWOL for a week.

17:47.141 --> 17:49.018
But the thing that bothers me the most...

17:49.101 --> 17:52.229
is that he's from one of the bases
in Idaho that's been sabotaged.

17:52.313 --> 17:55.482
You're thinking it's an attempt
to imperil the whole Z-400 program?

17:55.566 --> 17:56.650
Right.

17:56.734 --> 17:58.402
It's certainly a possibility.

17:58.485 --> 18:01.614
The flight will test its ability
to escape surveillance.

18:01.697 --> 18:04.366
It's a laser shield system.

18:04.450 --> 18:08.454
Now, if anything goes wrong,
it'll set the program back five years.

18:13.167 --> 18:15.044
I can't help thinking...

18:15.669 --> 18:18.839
what if the real purpose of the sabotage
at those other bases...

18:18.922 --> 18:21.633
was to switch the Z-400's landing
to San Remo?

18:30.058 --> 18:32.686
- Diana, are you in there?
- Just a minute.

18:33.020 --> 18:35.230
I have to break transmission, Steve.

18:38.483 --> 18:39.610
Come on in.

18:40.694 --> 18:43.071
Just ran off my first batch of prints.

18:43.155 --> 18:45.532
- Diana, these are good.
- You like them?

18:45.616 --> 18:47.701
Every newspaper in town
is gonna want them.

18:47.784 --> 18:48.910
Thank you.

18:48.994 --> 18:51.204
The Howlers are rehearsing
at the Service Club.

18:51.288 --> 18:53.874
I think there'd be
some good shots there for you.

18:53.957 --> 18:55.375
- Let's go.
- Okay.

19:19.774 --> 19:20.859
Good.

19:36.916 --> 19:40.211
Diana, I'd like you to meet my fiancé,
Maj. Alan Cornell.

19:40.295 --> 19:41.963
Nice to meet you, Major.

19:42.046 --> 19:44.883
I'm delighted.
I hear you're a wiz with a camera.

19:45.466 --> 19:49.262
Why don't I get a picture
of you and your gorgeous fiancée?

19:49.470 --> 19:51.639
- What do you say, Alan?
- Terrific.

19:53.391 --> 19:54.893
Let me see.

19:55.226 --> 19:57.854
Wanna use them as a background?

19:59.814 --> 20:01.274
Nice stuff.

20:18.583 --> 20:19.667
Smile.

20:27.717 --> 20:29.719
Alan, where are you going?

20:34.432 --> 20:36.559
Was it something I said?

20:50.448 --> 20:54.285
- Is there something wrong with him?
- I don't know.

20:54.743 --> 20:57.413
That's the second time he's done that.

20:57.496 --> 21:00.791
First time he didn't even realize
he'd driven off without me.

21:00.875 --> 21:02.001
I'd better go find him.

21:02.084 --> 21:04.670
If you need me,
I'll be here or back at the station.

21:04.753 --> 21:05.838
Thanks.

21:19.101 --> 21:21.729
When the snow falls, I must obey.

21:27.651 --> 21:31.321
Perhaps you might find
one of these useful, Sergeant?

21:33.073 --> 21:34.199
Thank you.

21:34.283 --> 21:37.327
Of course, the photography might not
be up to your standards.

21:37.411 --> 21:41.081
- It's just fine, Mr...
- Dante. Edmund Dante.

21:41.164 --> 21:43.083
I'm the group's manager.

21:49.172 --> 21:52.676
I'm Sgt. Diana Prince.
I'm with the Public Information Office.

21:52.843 --> 21:53.927
I see.

21:54.011 --> 21:57.180
Mitch, when you have a minute.
Thank you.

21:58.348 --> 22:02.269
- This is Sgt. Diana Prince.
- We've already met before.

22:02.853 --> 22:04.855
Hello. Glad you could make it.

22:05.021 --> 22:09.151
I think the young lady would enjoy
hearing more about the Hull City Howlers.

22:09.234 --> 22:12.571
- Can you fill her in?
- Be my pleasure.

22:12.737 --> 22:14.281
And spare no details.

22:15.073 --> 22:19.160
She strikes me as someone
who possesses a very inquisitive nature.

22:20.745 --> 22:24.416
- It was nice meeting you, Mr. Dante.
- A pleasure meeting you.

22:29.337 --> 22:33.216
You know, you've got be
the prettiest sergeant in the Air Force.

22:33.299 --> 22:34.551
You know that?

22:36.928 --> 22:38.221
Thank you, kind sir.

22:38.304 --> 22:41.766
I bet you say that to all the sergeants
on all the bases. Right?

22:41.850 --> 22:43.560
No. I'm serious.

22:43.643 --> 22:46.438
Listen. We've played all the bases around.

22:46.896 --> 22:50.692
Norris. McKinley. Lansdale.
You name it. But you...

22:51.484 --> 22:54.904
- You really lead the field.
- You have played all those bases?

22:54.988 --> 22:57.866
We have done more traveling
in the last couple of weeks...

22:57.949 --> 22:59.867
than most bands do in a year.

23:01.327 --> 23:04.205
Who decides
which bases you play and when?

23:04.289 --> 23:08.167
Edmund Dante. The guy you just met.
He sets up everything for us.

23:09.043 --> 23:13.131
You dropped in unexpectedly, Major.
But your timing was perfect.

23:15.007 --> 23:19.470
Something must have set you off,
which means you're out of control.

23:21.097 --> 23:25.143
And when one is out of control,
one is expendable.

23:28.729 --> 23:30.565
We need diversion.

23:31.566 --> 23:35.361
Something to place suspicion
squarely on someone else.

23:36.320 --> 23:37.488
Major.

23:38.155 --> 23:42.660
I'm going to give you a small, illegal task,
and like George Washington of old...

23:43.786 --> 23:46.038
you will admit your guilt.

23:51.669 --> 23:53.713
Right here. There you go.

24:08.060 --> 24:11.605
Now let's have one serious picture. Okay?

24:12.439 --> 24:14.275
Come on. Smile.

24:15.150 --> 24:17.111
Your mothers will love it.

24:18.445 --> 24:20.489
I think that's about it.

24:20.948 --> 24:22.116
Sure you got enough?

24:22.199 --> 24:24.702
Two rolls of film. I'm sure it's enough.

24:25.452 --> 24:28.038
That's just probably
some kind of drill or something.

24:28.122 --> 24:29.540
Listen. I was thinking maybe-

24:29.623 --> 24:32.376
Listen. Thanks, Mitch. Talk to you later.

24:50.143 --> 24:51.228
What happened?

24:51.311 --> 24:53.897
It's Maj. Cornell.
He had us locked up in the back room.

24:53.981 --> 24:56.275
I tried to stop him again
when he came back out.

24:56.358 --> 24:59.236
He's got enough explosives on him
to blow up the whole base.

24:59.319 --> 25:01.989
- Are you sure it was Maj. Cornell?
- I'm sure, sir.

25:02.072 --> 25:03.198
Where is he now?

25:03.281 --> 25:05.492
He headed toward
the communications towers.

25:05.575 --> 25:07.577
Get him to the hospital. Come on. Let's go.

26:06.302 --> 26:08.763
Major, I want your hands in the air.

26:09.347 --> 26:12.058
Back away from that detonator,
or I'll shoot.

26:17.188 --> 26:20.650
Sergeant, get your men out of here
or we'll all go together.

26:32.537 --> 26:33.621
Cover me!

26:58.521 --> 27:01.524
- I am guilty of all charges.
- It's a puzzle, Major.

27:04.735 --> 27:06.779
Why would
the Chief Communications Officer...

27:06.862 --> 27:08.906
want to destroy
the communications tower?

27:08.989 --> 27:12.743
- When the snow falls, I must obey.
- I've heard that litany before...

27:12.827 --> 27:15.204
from someone who sounded just like you.

27:16.580 --> 27:19.291
But I think
I know a way to snap you out of it.

27:28.342 --> 27:30.135
What's going on?

27:30.219 --> 27:34.223
Last thing I remember...
What's happening?

27:34.431 --> 27:37.059
I'll tell you.
We're placing you under arrest.

27:37.142 --> 27:38.644
Take him away.

27:42.064 --> 27:43.649
Thank you, Wonder Woman.

27:43.732 --> 27:46.944
- But I must inform you that-
- I know, Lieutenant.

27:47.820 --> 27:50.906
This is a security area. I was just leaving.

27:58.997 --> 28:02.501
Why would he do something like that?
It's unbelievable.

28:02.584 --> 28:04.962
Has he been under some kind of strain?

28:05.045 --> 28:08.507
Well, he must be.
Or on the verge of a breakdown.

28:09.675 --> 28:12.969
If not, there's got to be
someone or something behind it.

28:13.553 --> 28:17.182
The Alan Cornell I know
would never have done it on his own.

28:26.191 --> 28:29.027
What makes you think
it was a form of hypnotism?

28:29.361 --> 28:32.697
Because Maj. Cornell seemed to be
in some kind of trance...

28:32.781 --> 28:35.659
just like the airman
who tried to take me out in the hangar.

28:35.742 --> 28:38.286
The sound of a bell
seemed to snap him out ofit.

28:38.370 --> 28:42.207
A bell? Sounds like Pavlov's dogs,
only in reverse.

28:42.832 --> 28:45.669
I know that rock group
fits in this puzzle somewhere.

28:45.752 --> 28:47.837
Their manager's fingerprints
on that picture...

28:47.921 --> 28:49.756
are being checked in Washington
right now.

28:49.839 --> 28:53.301
Something else. Check out the dates
the group played at the other bases.

28:53.384 --> 28:57.305
If they were there when the sabotage
occurred, it'll be more than a coincidence.

28:57.388 --> 29:00.308
Steve, can't the flight of the Z-400
be canceled temporarily?

29:00.391 --> 29:04.020
No, it can't. It's already been launched
from its mother ship.

29:06.105 --> 29:08.483
Hey, what are you doing there?

29:11.402 --> 29:15.949
- Who are you?
- I'm the group's manager. Here's my card.

29:18.242 --> 29:19.827
I didn't see you when they arrived.

29:19.911 --> 29:22.705
I guess I was still on the bus
doing paperwork.

29:22.914 --> 29:24.999
There's lots of that these days.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.043
This base is on alert...

29:27.126 --> 29:31.172
and I just received an anonymous tip
that someone was prowling around here.

29:31.255 --> 29:34.926
I'm the only one here.
I wish I could help you, Lieutenant.

29:35.760 --> 29:38.638
Hey, maybe you can help me.

29:39.096 --> 29:41.599
Would you mind
holding this wedge for a second?

29:41.682 --> 29:43.100
I'll explain it to you.

29:43.184 --> 29:44.519
Our drummer is very fussy...

29:44.602 --> 29:47.146
and I have to be sure
these drums are well-adjusted.

29:47.230 --> 29:50.816
Just stick it under the drum.
All the way down. That's right.

29:51.943 --> 29:53.945
Yes. Little more, to the left.

29:55.279 --> 29:58.032
Yes. That's good.

29:59.075 --> 30:00.534
Absolutely perfect.

30:15.466 --> 30:17.301
Your help is invaluable.

30:22.181 --> 30:24.099
My help is invaluable.

30:25.142 --> 30:27.937
I will have more need for your help.

30:31.398 --> 30:34.652
My help is invaluable.

30:36.487 --> 30:38.197
That's right, Lieutenant.

30:39.573 --> 30:42.159
Follow me. Come.

31:02.846 --> 31:04.723
They have Alan in a cell.

31:05.641 --> 31:08.685
- His career is ruined.
- Maybe not, Anne.

31:10.187 --> 31:12.356
They wouldn't even let me see him.

31:12.981 --> 31:15.317
They said they can't afford
to take any chances...

31:15.400 --> 31:17.652
with the Lapdog missiles on the base...

31:17.736 --> 31:20.530
with someone in Alan's mental state.

31:20.614 --> 31:22.407
A Lapdog missile?

31:22.491 --> 31:25.285
We're the only base in the region
that has them.

31:25.368 --> 31:27.954
They're the newest heat-seeking missiles.

31:28.038 --> 31:30.248
Where are they on the base?

31:31.583 --> 31:33.752
Well, the launch pad is over there.

31:44.346 --> 31:46.514
You seem very interested, Diana.

31:48.016 --> 31:50.435
Maybe it's just the name
that intrigues me.

31:50.518 --> 31:53.188
No, there's more to it than that.

31:53.271 --> 31:55.857
In fact there's more to you
than meets the eye.

31:55.940 --> 31:59.444
I wondered why this morning
you got top-level security clearance...

31:59.527 --> 32:02.280
and I'm head of the department
and I don't even have one.

32:02.363 --> 32:05.867
I'll tell you the whole story later.
I better get to work.

32:14.375 --> 32:16.628
You will do what I command.

32:19.839 --> 32:21.799
My help is invaluable.

32:24.260 --> 32:28.306
A certain newly arrived officer
poses a bit of a problem for us.

32:28.890 --> 32:31.059
My help is invaluable.

32:31.476 --> 32:33.811
So, here are your instructions...

32:33.895 --> 32:37.231
pertaining to Lt. Col. Steve Trevor.

32:41.569 --> 32:45.531
You called it, Diana. The Hull City Howlers
were on each of the bases...

32:45.615 --> 32:47.700
on the days the sabotage occurred.

32:47.783 --> 32:50.995
What about the fingerprints
on that picture their manager gave me?

32:51.078 --> 32:53.831
They match the prints of one Otto Franz.

32:53.915 --> 32:57.668
The only person I can recall by that name
was a NATO colonel in Europe...

32:57.752 --> 33:00.254
who stole a prototype defense aircraft.

33:00.338 --> 33:02.506
During the process,
the plane was destroyed.

33:02.590 --> 33:05.426
I thought that both he and the pilot
died in the crash.

33:05.509 --> 33:06.969
I remember that case.

33:07.053 --> 33:11.057
There's something else about Col. Franz.
He's an expert in mesmerism.

33:11.348 --> 33:12.683
That's exactly right.

33:12.767 --> 33:17.062
Now that incident involving Maj. Cornell
is beginning to make a little sense.

33:17.146 --> 33:19.523
We're gonna have to
break transmission, Diana.

33:19.607 --> 33:22.067
Steve, we have to talk.
If Otto Franz is involved-

33:22.151 --> 33:25.613
Okay, meet me at the service club
at 1600 hours.

33:25.696 --> 33:28.115
Exactly 15 minutes from now.
Is that all right?

33:28.199 --> 33:29.742
- You got it.
- Okay.

33:33.621 --> 33:34.705
Come in.

33:36.206 --> 33:38.334
- Lt. Col. Trevor?
- Yes.

33:38.417 --> 33:41.086
A matter requiring
your immediate attention has arisen.

33:41.170 --> 33:43.547
It concerns the flight of the Z-400.

33:43.714 --> 33:46.759
- What happened?
- If you'd come with me, please, sir.

34:14.328 --> 34:16.955
- Hey, what's going on?
- Straight ahead, sir.

34:30.010 --> 34:31.928
Welcome, Lieutenant Colonel.

34:32.679 --> 34:37.350
Perhaps I should say,
"Welcome IADC agent Steve Trevor."

34:39.643 --> 34:43.273
- I'm Edmund Dante.
- Perhaps you should say Otto Franz.

34:47.027 --> 34:49.904
- So you know.
- Yes, we know.

34:49.987 --> 34:52.699
In spite of the clever plastic surgery...

34:52.782 --> 34:55.409
and your masquerade
as a rock group manager.

34:55.784 --> 34:58.413
Considering
I was brought up on Beethoven...

34:58.621 --> 35:02.751
a rock group is a rather cunning
door-opener, don't you think?

35:03.710 --> 35:05.879
You were a respected officer.

35:07.630 --> 35:08.923
Most respected.

35:10.467 --> 35:13.178
Not at all unlike yourself.

35:14.721 --> 35:18.391
But my career was a stepping stone
to more profitable activities.

35:19.058 --> 35:22.896
Of course, they have their risks,
as profitable activities do.

35:23.396 --> 35:25.898
You were responsible
for the death of that pilot...

35:25.982 --> 35:28.109
that crashed in the prototype plane.

35:28.192 --> 35:29.777
The pilot was a fool.

35:31.362 --> 35:33.239
It cost me $5 million.

35:33.448 --> 35:34.532
Yes.

35:35.116 --> 35:38.745
My payment
for the delivery of that aircraft intact.

35:39.078 --> 35:42.498
Tell me, what kind of a price tag
did they put on the Z-400?

35:42.582 --> 35:43.750
Substantial.

35:44.333 --> 35:46.502
But not for the Z-400 intact.

35:47.253 --> 35:48.921
It has to be destroyed.

35:49.338 --> 35:52.884
So as it approaches San Remo,
it will be blown to oblivion.

35:54.802 --> 35:59.098
An interested party in Eastern Europe
gains a defense advantage.

35:59.849 --> 36:01.601
And I gain a lot as well.

36:37.678 --> 36:40.472
As an IADC agent,
I'm sure you've been trained...

36:40.556 --> 36:43.434
to use all your senses to their utmost.

36:45.185 --> 36:48.063
Lieutenant Colonel. This is a test.

37:51.042 --> 37:53.795
You will do precisely what I tell you to do.

37:54.879 --> 37:57.382
You will think what I tell you to think.

37:57.465 --> 37:59.968
Your feelings will not be your own.

38:00.844 --> 38:02.220
You will pay.

38:03.221 --> 38:06.766
You and all the others
wearing a uniform like you.

38:09.394 --> 38:11.438
Every moment of your life.

38:12.021 --> 38:13.898
A frightful torment...

38:15.150 --> 38:17.277
unless I say otherwise.

38:18.486 --> 38:20.113
And why should I?

38:22.490 --> 38:26.578
Who but I know what real pain is?

38:31.958 --> 38:35.128
Lieutenant. You know your instructions.

38:35.295 --> 38:39.424
In precisely 33 minutes,
you will set off a Lapdog missile.

38:40.091 --> 38:43.052
At that time,
the Z-400 will be off the screens...

38:43.428 --> 38:46.139
testing its anti-surveillance equipment.

38:47.724 --> 38:49.434
And it won't come back.

38:51.561 --> 38:55.398
I can see them running around
wondering what happened to it.

38:56.941 --> 38:58.734
Lieutenant, it's time.

38:59.360 --> 39:02.029
Yes, my help is invaluable.

39:06.951 --> 39:10.162
And you.
You will go back to where I found you.

39:11.038 --> 39:15.042
I'm sure that the hardware store
will be most pleased to have you back.

39:20.798 --> 39:23.676
And it's a good time
for me to take my leave.

39:24.552 --> 39:26.971
As the unsuspecting Howlers howl...

39:28.389 --> 39:31.433
the Z-400 will burn.

40:08.595 --> 40:11.181
The sound of a bell
seemed to snap him out ofit.

40:11.265 --> 40:15.060
A bell? Sounds like Pavlov's dogs.
Only in reverse.

40:49.052 --> 40:51.930
The sound of a bell
seemed to snap him out ofit.

41:36.766 --> 41:38.101
Wonder Woman.

41:44.857 --> 41:47.527
Well, this ought to give you a workout.

43:56.196 --> 43:58.782
- What are you doing?
- Wonder Woman. Just in time.

43:58.865 --> 44:01.743
Just in time to get a few answers, Dante.

44:01.826 --> 44:04.913
Even with your special abilities,
you have to tell the truth.

44:04.996 --> 44:08.541
- How do you plan to destroy Z-400?
- With a Lapdog missile.

44:08.875 --> 44:09.960
I knew it.

44:10.919 --> 44:13.088
Who're you getting
to do your dirty work now?

44:13.171 --> 44:16.508
Lt. Stonehouse.
From the Launch Control Facility.

44:16.591 --> 44:18.051
South of the base.

44:18.301 --> 44:20.720
Don't bother. You're too late.

44:21.388 --> 44:22.514
We'll see.

44:23.139 --> 44:25.850
- Keep him on ice, Steve.
- It'll be my pleasure.

44:37.111 --> 44:38.488
It's Stonehouse.

44:38.780 --> 44:42.533
- Another security check, Lieutenant?
- No. A little more than that, Captain.

44:42.617 --> 44:46.371
Sergeant, move down the stairs.
Keep your hand away from that gun.

44:48.247 --> 44:50.750
Everyone, on your feet.

44:51.376 --> 44:52.460
Over here.

44:54.253 --> 44:58.132
Slowly unhook that gun belt
and let it fall to the floor.

44:59.634 --> 45:01.135
Have you gone crazy?

45:03.679 --> 45:05.598
Don't touch those controls.

45:29.205 --> 45:30.998
Twenty-eight seconds to go.

45:41.133 --> 45:42.635
The Lapdog's been launched.

45:42.718 --> 45:43.969
Then I'm too late.

45:44.053 --> 45:46.472
Right now it's headed
straight for the Z-400.

45:46.555 --> 45:48.599
But if I can only divert it.

45:50.976 --> 45:53.520
This is Zebra-400 calling San Remo.

45:54.188 --> 45:56.482
This is San Remo Control. Come in, Zebra.

45:56.565 --> 45:59.944
Have deactivated anti-surveillance shield.
Do you ha ve us?

46:00.027 --> 46:01.153
Affirmative.

46:01.236 --> 46:04.365
You're back on the screens, Zebra.
As large as life.

46:20.088 --> 46:22.925
There's a bogey at 6 o'clock.
Coming at us fast.

46:26.512 --> 46:28.055
Come on, baby, react.

46:45.447 --> 46:47.366
It's changed direction.

46:53.955 --> 46:56.500
- Good work, Captain.
- Look who's talking.

47:03.131 --> 47:05.592
I don't know about you,
but I feel like celebrating.

47:05.675 --> 47:08.136
The Z-400 test flight
was an unqualified success.

47:08.220 --> 47:11.765
Not to mention the fact that Otto Franz
is safely tucked away in jail.

47:11.848 --> 47:12.974
Yeah.

47:13.058 --> 47:14.893
- He's going to be all right.
- Alan?

47:14.976 --> 47:17.354
He's under observation
over at Psychiatric...

47:17.437 --> 47:19.773
