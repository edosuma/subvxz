WEBVTT

00:20.667 --> 00:23.300
"...AND IN THE NIGHT,
HE SEARCHES,

00:23.300 --> 00:25.667
"AND IN THE DAY,
HE SEARCHES,

00:25.667 --> 00:27.867
"AND ON THE MORROW,
HE WILL SEARCH,

00:27.867 --> 00:31.500
"CLOSE, REACHING,
YET IT WILL NOT BE FOUND,

00:31.500 --> 00:33.300
AND HE KNOWS THAT."

00:33.300 --> 00:36.200
NICE PASSION,
MATTHEW. VERY NICE.

00:36.200 --> 00:36.967
HEY, HUNTER.

00:39.200 --> 00:42.033
HEY, HOW WERE
YOU AFFECTED BY
THAT READING?

00:42.033 --> 00:45.300
I DON'T WANNA GO
TO SCHOOL, DADDY.

00:45.300 --> 00:47.300
CORY'S READING
POETRY.

00:47.300 --> 00:50.133
YOU GET YOUR BUTT
OUT OF THAT BED

00:50.133 --> 00:51.667
AND GET TO CLASS!

00:51.667 --> 00:52.667
OK...OK.

00:55.734 --> 00:58.600
GEE, I WONDER
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.367
FRANKIE, DO IT, BUDDY.

01:01.367 --> 01:03.100
WHAT THE POET
IS SAYING

01:03.100 --> 01:04.233
IN THIS
BEAUTIFUL PIECE--

01:04.233 --> 01:07.233
WHICH WAS VERY
MOVINGLY READ,
I MIGHT ADD--

01:07.233 --> 01:08.233
HEY.

01:08.233 --> 01:10.233
IS THAT SOMETIMES
WE LOVE,

01:10.233 --> 01:14.400
AND THOUGH IT SEEMS
THE OBJECT OF OUR LOVE
IS WITHIN REACH,

01:14.400 --> 01:16.100
IT DOES NOT RECIPROCATE,

01:16.100 --> 01:18.400
AND SO WE MUST
KEEP REACHING.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.667
IT'S NOT ABOUT A DOGGY?

01:20.667 --> 01:22.600
SHH, HONEY,
DON'T SPEAK.

01:23.734 --> 01:25.934
OUTSTANDING, STECCHINO,
OUTSTANDING.

01:25.934 --> 01:27.300
ANYTHING ELSE?

01:27.300 --> 01:29.100
YES. THANK YOU.

01:29.100 --> 01:30.467
[BELL RINGS]

01:32.734 --> 01:34.967
UH, FRANKIE...

01:34.967 --> 01:38.200
WHY THE SAD PUSS,
O KING OF POETRY?

01:38.200 --> 01:42.100
I'M AFRAID
THE POEM YOU SO
ELOQUENTLY READ--

01:42.100 --> 01:42.767
HEY.

01:42.767 --> 01:43.800
ABOUT SOMEONE

01:43.800 --> 01:46.000
WHO REACHES OUT FOR
AN UNATTAINABLE LOVE

01:46.000 --> 01:48.367
HITS A LITTLE
TOO CLOSELY TO HOME.

01:48.367 --> 01:50.600
WHY, FRANCIS ALBERT
STECCHINO,

01:50.600 --> 01:53.767
HAVE YOU BEEN STRUCK
BY CUPID'S ARROW?

01:53.767 --> 01:58.133
ALAS, THERE ARE DEEP
AND TURBULENT WATERS
WITHIN MY SOUL.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.500
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I AM.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.934
SIT, DARLING.
HAVE A NAP.

02:04.934 --> 02:08.600
HEY, STECCHINO,
YOU'RE DOING A HECK
OF A JOB IN CLASS.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.400
CAN YOU SAVE
THESE 2 GUYS?

02:12.500 --> 02:13.700
UH, FRANKIE,
FRANKIE,

02:13.700 --> 02:16.200
IT SOUNDS LIKE
WE HAVE THE BASIS

02:16.200 --> 02:18.233
FOR A LITTLE
NEGOTIATION HERE.

02:18.233 --> 02:19.667
I'M LISTENING.

02:19.667 --> 02:21.567
YOU HELP US
WITH POETRY,

02:21.567 --> 02:24.567
AND WE WILL
HELP YOU WITH
YOUR LOVE SITUATION.

02:24.567 --> 02:26.233
LET ME CONSIDER. OK.

02:26.233 --> 02:29.300
THE CONDITIONS
FOR YOUR DEAL
HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED.

02:29.300 --> 02:30.600
SO, FRANKIE,

02:30.600 --> 02:32.600
WHO'S THE GIRL
THAT'S DOING
THE DAMAGE?

02:32.600 --> 02:34.600
I WILL TELL YOU...

02:34.600 --> 02:36.834
BUT NOT HERE...

02:36.834 --> 02:38.300
AND NOT NOW.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.300
NOW, FRANKIE,
HOW CAN WE HELP YOU

02:42.300 --> 02:44.300
IF YOU WON'T
TELL US WHO IT IS?

02:44.300 --> 02:45.867
FRANKIE, I'M HOME.

02:45.867 --> 02:47.467
FATHER, IT IS
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.467
MAY I SHOW YOU
MY MOST RECENT
ADDITION

02:49.467 --> 02:52.100
TO THE NORTON
ANTHOLOGY COLLECTION
OF MODERN POETRY?

02:52.100 --> 02:55.300
YOU AND THAT POETRY.
YOU COULD'VE BEEN SOMEBODY.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.400
YOU COULD'VE
BEEN A SUMO.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.500
I'M SORRY I'M SUCH
A DISAPPOINTMENT
TO YOU.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.200
ME AND YOUR
BROTHER HERMAN
WERE AT THE GYM.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.500
HE'S GONNA BE
A WRESTLER LIKE
HIS FATHER. WW-WOOF!

03:05.500 --> 03:10.500
YES. I WILL CARRY ON
THE STECCHINO
WRESTLING TRADITION,

03:10.500 --> 03:14.300
ALTHOUGH MY BARKING
MUST IMPROVE.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.400
WOOF, WOOF.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.734
HE SAID "WOOF."
ISN'T THAT CUTE?

03:19.734 --> 03:21.500
I REMEMBER YOU,
LITTLE MAN.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.600
YOU'RE IN MY SON'S
POETRY CLASS.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.400
YOU'RE A BAD INFLUENCE.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.400
I SHOULD CRUSH YOU
LIKE GARLIC

03:27.400 --> 03:29.567
AND PUT YOU
IN MY SPAGHETTI.

03:29.567 --> 03:32.600
THAT'S WHAT YOU
SAID TO PSYCHO SID
AT THE SPECTRUM

03:32.600 --> 03:34.767
THE NIGHT YOU
POWER-BOMBED HIM
THROUGH THE MAT.

03:34.767 --> 03:35.667
YOU WERE THERE?

03:35.667 --> 03:37.667
I NEVER MISS
A MATCH.

03:37.667 --> 03:39.834
YOU SEE, FRANKIE?
THIS BOY'S A FAN.

03:39.834 --> 03:43.467
I LIKE THIS BOY!
WHY CAN'T YOU BE
THIS BOY?

03:43.467 --> 03:45.467
WOOF! WOOF! WOOF!

03:45.467 --> 03:47.367
Woof! Woof!

03:47.367 --> 03:49.800
AND YET,
I LOVE<i>YOU, </i>FATHER.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.300
OH, MY GOSH, CORY!

03:51.300 --> 03:53.567
I JUST REALIZED WHO
IT IS FRANKIE LOVES

03:53.567 --> 03:55.233
AND WHO DOESN'T
LOVE HIM BACK.

03:55.233 --> 03:56.567
YEAH, ME, TOO.

03:56.567 --> 03:58.400
AMY LEE REYNOLDS.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.367
YEAH...
AMY LEE REYNOLDS.
COME HERE.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.300
IT'S HIS FATHER!

04:11.500 --> 04:13.400
"SOMEONE IS TURNING
SWEET 16,

04:13.400 --> 04:16.300
AND IF YOU COULD BE THERE,
IT WOULD BE KEEN."

04:16.300 --> 04:18.300
MY MOM WROTE THAT.
IT'S SILLY. IT'S DUMB.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.300
A SWEET 16 PARTY.
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

04:20.300 --> 04:21.600
I'M SORRY YOU EVEN
HAVE TO READ THIS.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.734
TOPANGA...
YES, CORY?

04:22.734 --> 04:24.800
SLOW DOWN, HONEY.
SEPARATE YOUR WORDS.

04:24.800 --> 04:25.800
OK, I'LL TRY.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.400
PLEASE COME
TO MY SWEET 16.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.700
IT DOESN'T MEAN
A LOT TO ME,

04:28.700 --> 04:30.400
BUT IT MEANS A LOT
TO MY MOM.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.900
WHAT DO I TELL
MY MOTHER?

04:31.900 --> 04:33.100
AM I YOUR BOYFRIEND?

04:33.100 --> 04:35.000
YES, YOU ARE.
THEN I'LL
BE THERE.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.300
YOU'RE THE BEST.

04:37.667 --> 04:39.467
YEAH, WHEN
I'M ON MY GAME,

04:39.467 --> 04:41.033
NO ONE CAN TOUCH ME.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.667
GENTLEMEN,
THE KEY TO ANY POEM

04:44.667 --> 04:48.200
IS TO PUT YOURSELF
IN THE MIND OF THE POET--

04:48.200 --> 04:51.834
A QUIET PLACE.
A REFLECTIVE PLACE.

04:51.834 --> 04:56.500
IT'S TIME! IT'S TIME!
IT'S VADER TIME!

04:56.500 --> 04:59.667
I GOT IT! I GOT MY REMATCH
WITH JAKE THE SNAKE,

04:59.667 --> 05:01.934
AND THE CHUMP'S GOIN' DOWN!

05:01.934 --> 05:03.200
WWWW-WOOF!

05:04.367 --> 05:07.467
A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN SEE
WHAT THE POET SEES,

05:07.467 --> 05:10.300
WHERE YOU CAN FEEL
WHAT THE POET FEELS.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.500
WAIT A MINUTE,
FRANKIE.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.600
WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT
WITH YOUR FATHER?

05:13.600 --> 05:15.934
SEE WHAT HE SEES.
FEEL WHAT HE FEELS.

05:15.934 --> 05:17.233
MY FATHER IS NOT A POET.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.300
HE IS A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER,
VILLAIN CATEGORY,

05:19.300 --> 05:21.100
WITH THE WORLD
WRESTLING FEDERATION.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.800
NO, FRANKIE.
TALK TO HIM ABOUT
WHAT HE LOVES.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.400
YOU MEAN
MY BROTHER HERMAN?

05:25.400 --> 05:27.200
I WAS TALKING
ABOUT WRESTLING.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.967
WE'LL EVEN HELP
YOU, OK?

05:28.967 --> 05:32.133
YOUR GESTURE OF FRIENDSHIP
IS VERY MOVING.

05:32.133 --> 05:33.700
OK, HERE HE COMES.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.133
HIS FAMOUS MOVE IS
CALLED THE VADER BOMB.

05:36.133 --> 05:38.667
TELL HIM HE'S SETTING
IT UP TOO SLOWLY.

05:38.667 --> 05:41.767
DAD, I HAVE
A WRESTLING NOTION.

05:41.767 --> 05:44.734
YOU HAVE
A WRESTLING TIP
FOR ME?

05:44.734 --> 05:46.934
BRING IT ON!
BRING IT ON!

05:46.934 --> 05:50.133
I THINK THE VADER BOMB
WOULD BE BEST ACHIEVED
IF IT WERE SET UP--

05:50.133 --> 05:51.100
SLOWER? QUICKER?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.367
Quicker.
QUICKER.

05:52.367 --> 05:55.800
I KNEW
SOMETHING WAS WRONG
WITH THE BOMB.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.967
YOU KEEP
THOSE TIPS COMING.

05:57.967 --> 06:00.300
I WANT YOU RINGSIDE
AT THE FIGHT.

06:00.300 --> 06:03.033
GOOD BOY, FRANKIE.
GOOD BOY!

06:05.200 --> 06:08.600
CAN I HUG YOU GUYS NOW?

06:08.600 --> 06:10.400
SURE.
SURE.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.567
HEY.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
IF IT LOOKS LIKE I GOT
A SPRING IN MY STEP,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.767
IT'S BECAUSE I DO, AND I
HAVE YOU TO THANK FOR IT.

06:27.767 --> 06:29.934
I'M STARTING TO WIN
THE LOVE OF MY FATHER.

06:29.934 --> 06:31.800
WE TALK ABOUT WRESTLING,
BUT AT LEAST WE TALK.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.000
NO CHARGE, FRANKIE.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.567
SO, I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW NIGHT?

06:34.567 --> 06:36.233
TOMORROW NIGHT IT IS.

06:36.233 --> 06:38.233
CORY, YOU DON'T
GOT TOMORROW NIGHT.

06:38.233 --> 06:39.934
UH, FRANKIE, WAIT, WAIT.

06:39.934 --> 06:41.800
WHAT EXACTLY
IS TOMORROW NIGHT?

06:41.800 --> 06:44.200
THE MOST IMPORTANT
NIGHT OF MY LIFE.
SEE YOU THEN.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.467
WHAT SPECIFICALLY,
FRANKIE?

06:45.467 --> 06:48.100
IT IS WHEN MY FATHER FIGHTS
JAKE "THE SNAKE" ROBERTS.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.567
THE WINNER IS IN LINE
FOR A SHOT AT THE BELT

06:50.567 --> 06:52.367
AGAINST SHAWN MICHAELS
AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.

06:52.367 --> 06:54.500
HE WANTS ME AT RINGSIDE
TO GIVE HIM TIPS.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.667
THAT MEANS I NEED
SOMEONE LIKE YOU AT
MY SIDE TO GIVE ME TIPS.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.400
SOMEONE<i>LIKE </i>ME,
BUT NOT ME ME,

06:59.400 --> 07:02.467
SINCE I HAVE TOPANGA'S
16th BIRTHDAY PARTY
TO GO TO,

07:02.467 --> 07:04.133
WHICH MEANS NOTHING
AT ALL TO HER,

07:04.133 --> 07:06.900
EXCEPT EVERYTHING
IN THE WORLD IF YOU
LISTEN CLOSELY,

07:06.900 --> 07:08.900
BUT I CAN'T MAKE IT.
SORRY, BUD.

07:08.900 --> 07:10.767
I KNOW VERY LITTLE
ABOUT WRESTLING,

07:10.767 --> 07:12.400
EXCEPT WHEN I'M
PLAYING TWISTER

07:12.400 --> 07:13.867
WITH THE McCLUSKY
TRIPLETS.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.500
I WALK ALONE.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.600
ALONE I WALK.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.967
NO FATHER AMONG ME.

07:20.967 --> 07:23.800
WITHOUT A FATHER, I AM.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.133
I'LL BE THERE.

07:31.133 --> 07:33.600
I KNOW. YOU WANNA
KNOW WHY I KNOW?

07:33.600 --> 07:35.600
BECAUSE I WANT
EVERYBODY TO LOVE ME?

07:35.600 --> 07:37.033
I'VE NOTICED THAT,

07:37.033 --> 07:40.600
BUT I WAS GONNA SAY
IT'S BECAUSE YOU
HAVE A GOOD HEART.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.500
TOPANGA IS GONNA
KILL YOU.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.667
SHAWN, YOU
UNDERESTIMATE HER.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.200
SHE'LL WANT YOU
AT THAT PARTY.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.367
WOMEN AREN'T FORGIVING
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

07:50.367 --> 07:53.600
TOPANGA WILL FORGIVE.
TOPANGA'S NOT JUST
ANY WOMAN HERE.

07:57.133 --> 07:59.000
I BET YOU A BUCK
SHE FLIPS OUT.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.867
IT'S YOUR MONEY, LEROY.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.000
UH, TOPANGA,
SWEETHEART, LISTEN.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.900
THERE MIGHT BE
A SLIGHT CHANCE I WON'T
BE ABLE TO COME--

08:07.900 --> 08:09.233
I'LL JUST DIE!

08:09.233 --> 08:10.934
CORY, I KNOW I SAID
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT,

08:10.934 --> 08:12.367
BUT IT MEANS
EVERYTHING.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.367
I ONLY TURN 16 ONCE.
CORY, YOU HAVE
TO BE THERE.

08:14.367 --> 08:15.934
WE HAVE TO DANCE AT
THE PARTY TOGETHER.

08:15.934 --> 08:18.200
MY PARENTS DANCED
TOGETHER AT MY MOM'S
SWEET 16,

08:18.200 --> 08:19.700
SO WE HAVE TO, TOO.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.033
TOPANGA,
AM I YOUR BOYFRIEND?

08:21.033 --> 08:22.000
YES, YOU ARE.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.100
THEN I'LL BE THERE.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.000
I KNOW.
YOU WANNA KNOW
WHY I KNOW?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.200
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
A GOOD HEART?

08:27.200 --> 08:30.567
I WAS GOING TO SAY
BECAUSE YOU WANT
EVERYONE TO LOVE YOU,

08:30.567 --> 08:33.100
BUT YEAH, BECAUSE YOU
HAVE A GOOD HEART.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.200
WHY DO THESE THINGS
ALWAYS HAPPEN TO ME?

08:42.200 --> 08:43.367
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

08:43.367 --> 08:45.233
THESE THINGS HAPPEN
TO GOOD GUYS.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.600
THAT'S NICE
OF YOU TO SAY,

08:46.600 --> 08:49.200
BUT I'D BETTER BE
REAL GOOD TO BE
2 PLACES AT ONCE.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.800
IT MUST
AND WILL BE DONE.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.300
YOU HAVE
THE TECHNOLOGY?

08:52.300 --> 08:53.300
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.967
THE NEED TO BE
IN 2 PLACES AT ONCE

08:54.967 --> 08:57.300
IS A DILEMMA
THAT DATES BACK
THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.734
LUCKY FOR YOU,
I AM A STUDENT
IN SUCH MATTERS.

08:59.734 --> 09:01.767
SO WHAT'S THIS,
AN INSTRUCTIONAL
DEEPAK CHOPRA,

09:01.767 --> 09:04.400
VENUS AND MARS,
BUY REAL ESTATE
NO MONEY DOWN,

09:04.400 --> 09:07.000
AB REDUCER,
JUICE TIGER
KIND OF THING?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.300
IT'S<i>THE FLINTSTONES.</i>

09:08.300 --> 09:09.800
I WAS GONNA SAY THAT.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.367
THIS IS A CLASSIC EPISODE

09:11.367 --> 09:13.500
WHERE FRED HAS TO BE
AT PEBBLES' BIRTHDAY PARTY

09:13.500 --> 09:16.900
AND THE BIG BASH AT
THE WATER BUFFALO LODGE
ON THE SAME NIGHT.

09:16.900 --> 09:19.500
OH. I REMEMBER
BEING VERY NERVOUS
DURING THIS ONE.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.934
YES, QUITE A DILEMMA
FOR OUR PREHISTORIC FRIEND.

09:22.934 --> 09:24.000
LET'S WATCH.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.934
ALL RIGHT...
FRED FLINTSTONE:

09:25.934 --> 09:28.400
NICE GUY, BIG FEET,
JUST LIKE YOU.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.800
AND HE'S GOT
A GOOD BEST FRIEND.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.300
THAT'S RIGHT--BARNEY.
THAT'S ME.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.734
WATCH FRED'S TECHNIQUE.
LET'S GO FRAME BY FRAME.

09:34.734 --> 09:37.734
HERE HE IS, BACKING OUT
OF THE WATER BUFFALO LODGE.

09:37.734 --> 09:40.100
HE'S TAKING OFF
HIS WATER BUFFALO HELMET.

09:40.100 --> 09:40.967
THAT'S KEY.

09:40.967 --> 09:42.667
HUH. A SIMPLE
COSTUME CHANGE,

09:42.667 --> 09:44.200
AND HE FOOLS
EVERYBODY.

09:44.200 --> 09:47.734
NOW HERE, HE ARRIVES
AT PEBBLES' BIRTHDAY PARTY
CORRECTLY ATTIRED,

09:47.734 --> 09:49.100
AND NO ONE'S THE WISER.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.600
I'VE CALCULATED
YOUR DISTANCES.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.934
THE FLINTSTONE SCENARIO
IS DOABLE IN YOUR CASE.

09:52.934 --> 09:54.600
I ASSUME YOU HAD
A FALLBACK PLAN.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.000
<i>JOHNNY QUEST,</i>

09:56.000 --> 09:58.600
BUT THEN YOU WOULD NEED
HAJI AND A HOVERCRAFT.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.000
OK, TOPANGA'S SWEET 16

10:00.000 --> 10:02.700
IS A MERE 3/10
OF A MILE FROM VADER'S
WRESTLING MATCH.

10:02.700 --> 10:03.867
WHAT'S OUR TIME
CONSTRAINTS?

10:03.867 --> 10:05.200
I'M ON THAT, TOO.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.400
FRED NEVER SPENT
MORE THAN 75 SECONDS
AT EITHER LOCATION.

10:07.400 --> 10:10.200
BUT THAT WAS A CARTOON.
TIME WAS COMPRESSED.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.033
WE'RE REAL.
WE'RE IN REAL TIME.

10:12.033 --> 10:13.867
TRUST ME,
IT'S THE SAME THING.

10:13.867 --> 10:16.500
NO, IT'S NOT. YOU SEE,
A TELEVISION SHOW

10:16.500 --> 10:19.767
CAN COVER
MANY DAYS IN ONLY ONE
HALF-AN-HOUR PROGRAM.

10:19.767 --> 10:22.700
TRUST ME,
IT'S THE SAME THING.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.767
OK.

10:24.767 --> 10:26.767
NOW, HERE COMES TRAGEDY.

10:26.767 --> 10:28.500
FRED ARRIVES
AT PEBBLES' PARTY,

10:28.500 --> 10:30.667
AND HE'S WEARING
HIS BUFFALO HELMET.

10:30.667 --> 10:31.834
WILMA GETS
WHAT'S GOING ON.

10:31.834 --> 10:34.734
HERE SHE COMES WITH
A FRYING PAN, AND...

10:34.734 --> 10:36.467
[CLANG CLANG CLANG]

10:36.467 --> 10:38.567
WELL, WE CAN'T LET
THAT HAPPEN, BARNEY.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.500
I'M HERE FOR YOU, FRED.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.934
HE IS THE BEST.

10:54.934 --> 10:57.900
HE IS VADER!

10:57.900 --> 11:00.667
THERE HE IS.
THERE IS THE MAN,

11:00.667 --> 11:03.000
THE ONE AND ONLY VADER!

11:03.000 --> 11:05.500
THERE HE IS,
HIS SON RIGHT THERE--

11:05.500 --> 11:08.000
FRANKIE--ALONG
WITH CORY AND SHAWN.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
THEY ARE HIS
SPECIAL ADVISERS
FOR THIS MATCH-UP

11:11.000 --> 11:13.200
BECAUSE IF VADER
IS VICTORIOUS,

11:13.200 --> 11:19.200
IT PUTS HIM IN LINE
FOR A TITLE SHOT AT
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.

11:22.400 --> 11:26.600
OH, YES! VADER LOOKS
TO BE IN TREMENDOUS FORM!

11:26.600 --> 11:29.867
HE IS HERE TO IMPRESS
HIS SON FRANKIE.

11:29.867 --> 11:32.000
HE HAS SOMETHING TO PROVE,

11:32.000 --> 11:35.500
AND HE PLANS ON
PROVING IT TONIGHT!

11:37.367 --> 11:40.500
OH, YES. THERE
THEY ARE IN THE RING.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.233
THERE'S VADER'S SON
IN THE RING,

11:42.233 --> 11:46.600
CORY AND SHAWN--
THEY ARE TAUNTING
JAKE "THE SNAKE" ROBERTS.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.834
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE RING, JAKE THE SNAKE!

11:49.834 --> 11:51.000
HE'S GOT THE SNAKE!

11:51.000 --> 11:53.367
HE'S GOT THE SNAKE!
THEY BETTER WATCH OUT!

11:57.500 --> 12:01.400
FRANKIE, CORY, AND SHAWN,
THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO!

12:01.400 --> 12:03.133
GET THE SNAKE
OUT OF THE RING.

12:03.133 --> 12:06.734
THE SNAKE DOES NOT BELONG
IN THE WRESTLING RING!

12:06.734 --> 12:08.600
VADER WANTS TO KNOW
WHO THE MAN IS.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.900
I KNOW WHO THE MAN IS.
THE MAN IS VADER!

12:12.900 --> 12:17.600
THE FANS HERE WOULD LIKE
TO SEE JAKE THE SNAKE
D.D.T. VADER.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.734
HEY, WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

12:20.734 --> 12:22.500
UH, WE FORGOT
TO BUY PROGRAMS.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.400
YOU CAN'T TELL
THE PLAYERS APART
WITHOUT A PROGRAM.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.567
MY FATHER.
NOT MY FATHER.

12:27.567 --> 12:29.300
HOW HARD
COULD THIS BE?

12:39.700 --> 12:41.100
TOPANGA,
THERE YOU ARE.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.300
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

12:43.300 --> 12:44.700
I'VE BEEN HERE
FOR 20 MINUTES,

12:44.700 --> 12:45.734
AND I COULDN'T
FIND YOU

12:45.734 --> 12:47.467
BECAUSE OF
THE SIZE OF
THIS TURNOUT.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.000
A PERSON COULD
GET LOST IN HERE.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.200
BUT THERE I GO,
RUNNING OFF
AT THE MOUTH,

12:51.200 --> 12:53.934
KEEPING YOU FROM
MINGLING WITH YOUR
INTERESTING GUESTS.

12:53.934 --> 12:56.100
OFF YOU GO. MINGLE.
MINGLE, MINGLE.

12:56.100 --> 12:57.800
75.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.133
I KNOW I SAID
A LOT ABOUT THIS
NOT MEANING ANYTHING,

13:00.133 --> 13:02.500
BUT THE TRUTH IS
NOW THAT THE TIME'S HERE

13:02.500 --> 13:04.567
AND WE'RE ABOUT TO SHARE
THAT SPECIAL DANCE,

13:04.567 --> 13:07.767
I REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT
A MOMENT LIKE THIS IS
IN OUR LIVES.

13:07.767 --> 13:09.700
I REALIZE THAT, TOO.
IN FACT--

13:09.700 --> 13:11.000
Wrap it up!

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
THE END.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.467
UH, TOPANGA,
YOUR AUNT RUTHIE,

13:14.467 --> 13:17.800
SHE'S OVER THERE,
AND FOR HOW LONG
NO ONE KNOWS.

13:17.800 --> 13:22.133
IN FACT, NO ONE KNOWS
HOW LONG ANY OF US
WILL BE HERE.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.200
THAT WAS CRAZY.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.233
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I SAID. SHIRTS?

13:28.233 --> 13:29.600
CHECK.
MASKS?

13:29.600 --> 13:30.800
CHECK.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO!

13:41.033 --> 13:42.600
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

13:42.600 --> 13:44.600
YOUR AUNT RUTHIE,
SHE'S OVER THERE.

13:44.600 --> 13:45.500
OTHER PLACE.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.400
UH, WE HAD TO BUY
VADER MASKS,

13:47.400 --> 13:49.400
AND THE PEOPLE
AND THE LINE...

13:49.400 --> 13:50.200
WHAT?

13:50.200 --> 13:52.100
GIVE ME SOMETHING!

13:52.100 --> 13:55.000
Brother Love:
FRANKIE LOOKING ON.
HE HAS TO BE WORRIED.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.300
HIS FATHER'S
NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD
IN THE RING RIGHT NOW

13:58.300 --> 13:59.400
AGAINST JAKE THE SNAKE.

13:59.400 --> 14:03.000
FRANKIE HAS GOT
TO BE CONCERNED.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.600
THEIR ADVICE HAS
NOT BEEN PAYING OFF.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.600
JAKE'S MOVING IN
FOR THE D.D.T.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.967
TELL YOUR DAD
TO COUNTER,
OR HE'S A GONER.

14:13.967 --> 14:16.367
WATCH OUT FOR
THE D.D.T., DAD!

14:16.367 --> 14:19.400
THE CROWD CHANTING
FOR THE D.D.T.!

14:19.400 --> 14:21.300
THEY WANT THE D.D.T.!

14:22.734 --> 14:24.467
OH, BUT VADER COUNTERS!

14:24.467 --> 14:26.800
IT MUST'VE BEEN
THE ADVICE FROM FRANKIE!

14:28.400 --> 14:29.233
75!

14:29.233 --> 14:30.967
HEY, WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

14:30.967 --> 14:32.100
FRANKIE, I--I--

14:32.100 --> 14:34.100
WRAP IT UP!
THE END.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.400
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
ALMOST TOO EASY, BARNEY.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.900
DON'T GET COCKY.
THAT'S WHERE
MISTAKES HAPPEN.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.200
OK, I'M OFF TO MIX.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.934
WAIT, WAIT!
WHAT?

14:43.934 --> 14:45.734
HAVE A GOOD TIME, MAN.
THANKS.

14:45.734 --> 14:47.200
AND TAKE OFF THE MASK.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.834
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO CATCH THIS STUFF.

14:48.834 --> 14:50.467
HEY, ANYBODY
COULD'VE MISSED THAT.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.767
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

14:56.767 --> 14:58.500
ME?
YES, YOU.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.400
I HAVE BEEN
ACROSS THIS ROOM,

15:00.400 --> 15:02.600
MUST'VE BEEN
20 TIMES,
LOOKING FOR YOU.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.600
A GUY GETS WORRIED
IS WHAT HAPPENS.

15:04.600 --> 15:05.734
YOU'RE OUT OF BREATH.

15:05.734 --> 15:07.567
LOOKING FOR YOU,
BUT I FOUND YOU,

15:07.567 --> 15:10.100
AND YOU'RE HERE,
AND NOW I CAN
BREATHE EASY.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.734
I'M SORRY.
ACCEPTED.

15:11.734 --> 15:12.900
SEE YOU LATER.

15:12.900 --> 15:14.200
WHAT? WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

15:14.200 --> 15:15.600
UH, NOWHERE,

15:15.600 --> 15:17.800
BECAUSE THERE'S
STILL THE MATTER OF
THAT SPECIAL DANCE

15:17.800 --> 15:19.467
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT
TO YOU--ME--US!

15:19.467 --> 15:22.900
I'M GLAD IT MEANS
SOMETHING TO YOU,
TOO, CORY.

15:22.900 --> 15:24.133
I'LL GO ASK
THE DEEJAY.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.700
CORY! I'VE BEEN
WATCHING THE MATCH
ON THAT TV.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.600
JAKE'S TAKEN THE SNAKE
OUT OF THE BAG.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.767
THAT MEANS
VADER'S HISTORY.

15:34.767 --> 15:35.734
WITHOUT OUR HELP,
HE IS.

15:35.734 --> 15:37.133
OK, THERE AND BACK,

15:37.133 --> 15:39.467
BUT IF WE DON'T
GET BACK BEFORE
THIS SONG STARTS,

15:39.467 --> 15:41.033
<i>I'M </i>HISTORY.

15:49.767 --> 15:53.100
♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY ♪

15:55.400 --> 15:58.100

16:04.133 --> 16:06.600
OH, NO! VADER
HASN'T GOT--

16:08.667 --> 16:10.000
YOUR TIPS
ARE NOT WORKING.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.800
MY FATHER WILL SURELY
LOSE THE MATCH,

16:11.800 --> 16:13.567
AND I WILL LOSE
HIS LOVE FOREVER.

16:13.567 --> 16:15.300
NO, MY TIPS
ARE GOLD, OK?

16:15.300 --> 16:17.667
YOUR DAD'S GONNA
TURN THIS MATCH AROUND
ANY SECOND.

16:25.867 --> 16:27.767
FATHER! FATHER,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

16:27.767 --> 16:28.934
GIVE ME A WOOF!

16:28.934 --> 16:30.033
I'VE GOT NOTHING, BOY.

16:30.033 --> 16:32.133
I'M LOSING MY SHOT
AT THE BELT!

16:32.133 --> 16:34.867
THIS IS WHERE
THE BEATEN-UP FIGHTER

16:34.867 --> 16:37.400
LOOKS IN THE CROWD
AT THE ONE PERSON

16:37.400 --> 16:40.767
THAT CAN GIVE HIM
THE INSPIRATION TO GO ON.

16:40.767 --> 16:44.100
NOW WHAT DO YOU GOT
FOR ME, BOY?

16:44.100 --> 16:46.400
WHAT DO YOU
GOT FOR ME, BOY?

16:46.400 --> 16:49.700
SORRY, FRANKIE.
I'M ALL OUT OF IDEAS.

16:49.700 --> 16:54.567
FATHER, I HAVE NO TIPS
ABOUT PILE DRIVERS
OR SCOOP SLAMS.

16:54.567 --> 16:58.834
ALL I HAVE IS
THE LOVE OF A SON
FOR HIS FATHER,

16:58.834 --> 17:01.500
FOR NO MATTER
THE OUTCOME
OF THIS MATCH,

17:01.500 --> 17:05.500
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE
CHAMPION OF THE WORLD
IN MY HEART.

17:05.500 --> 17:09.133
WOULD IT BE OK...
IF I WON?

17:09.133 --> 17:11.400
WELL, MY FRIENDS DID
COME ALL THIS WAY.

17:15.867 --> 17:19.934
JAKE! THIS ONE'S
FOR MY SON!

17:19.934 --> 17:22.000
IT IS ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.300
VADER GETTING BACK IN NOW
WITH A VENGEANCE--OH!

17:25.300 --> 17:26.300
YEAH!
YEAH!

17:29.133 --> 17:31.000
VADER!

17:31.000 --> 17:33.900
VADER, NOW POUNDING
JAKE THE SNAKE
IN THE CORNER.

17:33.900 --> 17:37.033
RIGHTS AND LEFTS!
PUNCHES TO THE HEAD!

17:37.033 --> 17:38.800
PUNCHES TO THE MIDSECTION.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.934
JAKE THE SNAKE GOES DOWN.

17:40.934 --> 17:44.867
VADER...HAS GOT
THE SNAKE IN POSITION.

17:44.867 --> 17:48.000
HE'S SIGNALING
FOR THE VADER BOMB!

17:48.000 --> 17:52.300
VADER IS SIGNALING
FOR THE VADER BOMB!

17:52.300 --> 17:54.700
IF HE HITS...

17:54.700 --> 17:57.100
HE HITS THE VADER BOMB!

17:58.600 --> 18:03.000
3! HERE IS
YOUR WINNER!

18:03.000 --> 18:07.600
HERE IS YOUR WINNER!

18:07.600 --> 18:09.300
VAAA-DERRRR!

18:13.467 --> 18:17.200
WOW, THIS IS, LIKE,
THE GREATEST MOMENT
OF MY LIFE.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.000
NO, IT'S NOT.

18:32.934 --> 18:34.667
HOW'S THE FIGHT
GOING?

18:34.667 --> 18:35.934
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

18:42.934 --> 18:44.300
WHAT, YOU
BELIEVE THAT?

18:45.734 --> 18:46.567
HI, SHAWN.

18:46.567 --> 18:48.300
I HAD
A VERY NICE TIME.

18:48.300 --> 18:49.500
THANK YOU
FOR INVITING ME.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.200
HOW COULD YOU DO
THIS TO ME, CORY?

18:52.200 --> 18:54.567
YOU KNEW HOW
IMPORTANT THIS WAS.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.767
LOOK, TOPANGA,
IF IT HELPS, I'M SORRY.

18:57.767 --> 19:00.300
I MEAN,
I RUINED YOUR PARTY,

19:00.300 --> 19:02.667
AND I KNOW YOU'LL
NEVER FORGIVE ME.

19:02.667 --> 19:06.700
I GUESS THIS IS WHERE
I GET HIT ON THE HEAD
WITH A FRYING PAN.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.567
OK, WHAT'S HE
TALKING ABOUT?

19:08.567 --> 19:11.900
<i>FLINTSTONES.</i>
HE HAD TO BE AT
2 PLACES AT ONCE.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.400
OH, THE WATER BUFFALO-
PEBBLES EPISODE.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.400
AND YOU WONDER WHY
I LOVE THIS GIRL.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.934
I'VE BEEN
SITTING HERE SINCE
EVERYBODY LEFT,

19:19.934 --> 19:21.500
AND I'VE BEEN
WRESTLING, TOO--

19:21.500 --> 19:24.667
WRESTLING WITH HOW
YOU COULD'VE POSSIBLY
LEFT ME HERE ALONE.

19:24.667 --> 19:28.500
AND I KNOW YOU,
AND I KNOW YOU HAVE
A GOOD REASON.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.000
TELL ME YOUR
GOOD REASON, CORY.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.600
I WAS HELPING FRANKIE
GET CLOSER WITH HIS DAD.

19:38.500 --> 19:39.934
LOOKS LIKE YOU DID.

19:42.367 --> 19:45.467
LOOK, I WANT YOU
TO KNOW, I WOULD
NEVER HURT YOU.

19:45.467 --> 19:48.967
I'M SORRY WE
COULDN'T DANCE TOGETHER
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

19:48.967 --> 19:50.934
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE
DOESN'T MATTER.

19:50.934 --> 19:52.500
IT WAS JUST
A SPECIAL DANCE,

19:52.500 --> 19:55.233
AND I WANTED IT
TO BE WITH YOU.

19:55.233 --> 19:57.033
HEY, FRED.

19:57.033 --> 19:58.500
YEAH, BARN?

19:58.500 --> 20:01.233
