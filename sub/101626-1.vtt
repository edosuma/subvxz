WEBVTT

01:57.149 --> 01:59.918
Honey, I have something to
tell you.

01:59.951 --> 02:00.953
We did it.

02:00.986 --> 02:01.820
I'm pregnant.

02:02.688 --> 02:03.990
Hm, well that was quick.

02:05.590 --> 02:07.259
I think I can feel it moving.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.661
It's trying to get out.

02:09.828 --> 02:11.097
Well, put your legs up.

02:12.031 --> 02:14.933
It's supposed to help.

02:17.902 --> 02:18.971
Is that good?

02:20.038 --> 02:21.973
Fuckin' oath.

02:22.007 --> 02:23.075
I hate that saying.

02:25.243 --> 02:26.945
Well, you better get used to
it Yankee.

02:26.979 --> 02:28.915
You're on our turf now.

02:45.663 --> 02:48.967
Hey babe, I was thinkin' we
should escape for the weekend.

02:49.001 --> 02:49.868
This weekend?

02:51.002 --> 02:52.504
Yeah, what do you say?

02:54.038 --> 02:55.474
Nah, I don't think so.

02:56.474 --> 02:58.276
I have too much to catch up on.

02:58.310 --> 03:00.780
Oh, you've always got somethin'
to catch up on don't ya?

03:00.812 --> 03:02.114
Come on, let's just do it.

03:03.649 --> 03:04.884
Where are we gonna go?

03:04.917 --> 03:06.185
Well, there's this place my
dad

03:06.217 --> 03:07.953
would take me and my sister.

03:07.986 --> 03:12.991
It's a few hours away
right next to Mount Ida.

03:13.525 --> 03:17.462
Pretty much trees, a lake,
whole lot of nothin'.

03:17.496 --> 03:21.534
So what, we rent a house
or bed and breakfast?

03:21.567 --> 03:24.537
No, I was thinkin' of
gettin' Robby's caravan.

03:24.569 --> 03:25.937
A caravan, like a trailer?

03:25.971 --> 03:27.772
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

03:27.806 --> 03:29.875
You're asking me to
go camping in a trailer,

03:29.907 --> 03:32.043
like is this is a joke, David?

03:32.076 --> 03:33.111
No.

03:33.145 --> 03:34.247
I know your whole thing,

03:34.280 --> 03:36.215
I just thought that,
you know, it would be...

03:36.247 --> 03:37.349
My whole thing?

03:38.349 --> 03:40.051
David, you're acting
like you don't know me.

03:40.085 --> 03:41.554
I shower with the door open.

03:41.586 --> 03:42.387
- I drive with
- I know.

03:42.420 --> 03:43.221
the windows down.

03:43.254 --> 03:44.088
Like, you just

03:44.122 --> 03:45.191
- know that that's...
- I know, I know.

03:45.223 --> 03:46.358
I just thought that this would
be

03:46.391 --> 03:50.996
the perfect opportunity to
face your fears so to speak.

03:52.730 --> 03:54.199
No.

03:54.233 --> 03:55.568
You made it here in a plane,
right?

03:55.600 --> 03:57.402
- Like, what's a caravan?
- Yeah, but David,

03:57.436 --> 03:58.871
I was doped up and knocked out.

03:58.903 --> 04:01.206
That's not how I want
to spend a weekend away.

04:04.242 --> 04:07.346
All right, just think about
it.

04:07.378 --> 04:10.649
You, me, campfire, the night
sky.

04:11.516 --> 04:15.687
Extreme outdoors with a
dash, just a dash of caravan.

04:16.588 --> 04:17.890
A dash?

04:17.923 --> 04:18.858
Yeah.

04:18.891 --> 04:20.926
We'll just be sleeping
in there, that's it.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.795
Think about how romantic that
would be.

04:22.827 --> 04:23.662
Hey?

04:24.529 --> 04:25.630
Look, if the caravan's too much

04:25.663 --> 04:26.632
we can always sleep
outside under the stars.

04:26.665 --> 04:28.968
Nights are warm now anyway.

04:29.999 --> 04:31.770
Oh, I just, I don't...

04:31.803 --> 04:33.571
Come on, I promise.

04:33.605 --> 04:36.309
I promise, hey, you'll have a
good time.

04:36.341 --> 04:37.576
You'll have a great time.

04:42.747 --> 04:45.517
I'll walk around naked the whole
time.

04:45.550 --> 04:47.019
How's that?

04:47.052 --> 04:47.887
Hm?

04:50.456 --> 04:52.391
- David, I love you,
- Mm hm.

04:52.423 --> 04:55.161
but A, I don't do camping
and B I don't do trailers.

04:55.194 --> 04:55.995
Like...

04:56.028 --> 04:56.963
It's a caravan.

04:56.995 --> 04:58.630
Whatever, either,
both, it doesn't matter.

04:58.663 --> 05:00.599
I just, you know I don't wanna
do it.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.970
It'll be good for you to
step outside your comfort zone.

05:05.002 --> 05:06.104
I'm dating you aren't I?

05:08.706 --> 05:13.611
Listen, if you wanna get
a cottage or a little unit,

05:13.644 --> 05:16.014
even a house boat, perfect,
fantastic.

05:16.048 --> 05:19.518
I'll do it but there's just no
way,

05:19.550 --> 05:20.786
I'm sorry, there's no way in
hell

05:20.819 --> 05:24.691
I'm going camping with you in
a caravan this weekend, okay?

07:28.012 --> 07:30.548
Oh, how good is this?

07:30.581 --> 07:32.250
How good is this?

07:36.588 --> 07:38.189
It's been almost 20 years.

07:38.223 --> 07:39.559
Place hasn't changed a bit.

07:41.026 --> 07:42.728
Do you think we'll
get anyone else out here?

07:42.761 --> 07:43.929
People?

07:43.961 --> 07:44.930
No way.

07:44.963 --> 07:46.532
I'm surprised I found it again.

07:48.867 --> 07:50.636
So, we're gonna do this or what?

07:51.702 --> 07:52.737
Come on.

07:52.771 --> 07:54.907
You got this.

07:57.910 --> 07:58.744
Come on.

08:04.149 --> 08:05.016
Get in here.

08:07.084 --> 08:08.753
How good is it?

08:08.786 --> 08:10.522
How good is this?

08:10.555 --> 08:11.356
Look at all this space.

08:11.389 --> 08:12.858
We've got solar panels on the
roof

08:12.891 --> 08:14.293
so we can like have power.

08:14.326 --> 08:16.495
We got running water, kind of,

08:16.528 --> 08:18.030
like for the next trip anyway.

08:19.564 --> 08:21.432
It's kinda retro and old school
I guess.

08:21.466 --> 08:23.369
Falling away a bit but who
knows?

08:23.401 --> 08:25.070
Babe, you all right?

08:26.805 --> 08:29.040
I'm just really anxious.

08:30.475 --> 08:31.310
I've got ya.

08:32.210 --> 08:33.078
Here.

08:33.110 --> 08:34.480
I brought this.

08:34.513 --> 08:35.980
How good's that?

08:36.014 --> 08:37.316
Put it on when you start to feel
weird

08:37.349 --> 08:41.186
and then just take it off when
you're ready to give it a go.

08:41.219 --> 08:42.052
You don't think this will be

08:42.086 --> 08:43.621
the same as me just closing my
eyes?

08:43.654 --> 08:44.490
Babe.

08:47.292 --> 08:49.427
I don't know, it just...

08:49.461 --> 08:50.962
Give it a shot.

08:50.995 --> 08:51.996
Just keep it on.

08:52.029 --> 08:53.464
- Why?
- Just keep it on.

08:53.498 --> 08:54.333
Don't touch it.

09:02.573 --> 09:03.375
What are you doing?

09:03.408 --> 09:04.310
Nothing, nothing.

09:04.342 --> 09:05.176
Hey?

09:06.244 --> 09:07.646
Let's go get a drink.

09:07.678 --> 09:09.180
Come on.

09:09.214 --> 09:10.616
You're such an idiot.

09:48.153 --> 09:50.089
Wouldn't it be cool if we saw a
UFO?

09:51.023 --> 09:53.425
Yeah, that'd be pretty
cool.

09:53.457 --> 09:56.260
I was thinking it would be
cooler if we saw a star explode.

09:56.293 --> 09:58.230
What about the moon exploding?

09:58.263 --> 09:59.064
- Just...
- No.

10:00.698 --> 10:01.866
David, that would be bad.

10:01.899 --> 10:03.401
Then there wouldn't be anymore
tides.

10:03.434 --> 10:04.269
Or werewolves.

10:07.205 --> 10:09.108
This is a good thing, huh?

10:09.140 --> 10:10.642
Yeah, it's a good thing.

10:11.842 --> 10:14.413
Let's do this like every year.

10:14.446 --> 10:16.782
- Hm.
- Like, forever.

10:16.815 --> 10:19.985
I'm giving you six
months, then I'm upgrading.

10:20.018 --> 10:21.052
What did you say?

10:21.086 --> 10:22.553
I said I'm upgrading after six
months

10:22.586 --> 10:23.788
'cause you're way too clingy.

10:23.822 --> 10:25.658
You know what?

10:25.691 --> 10:27.793
I said you're way to clingy.

10:27.826 --> 10:28.627
Yes.

10:28.659 --> 10:29.461
Don't!

10:29.494 --> 10:30.596
Don't, don't.

10:30.629 --> 10:31.697
Don't, that's off limits.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.701
You ever done it camping
before?

10:36.735 --> 10:38.971
15 times with five different
girls.

10:39.004 --> 10:40.538
You're dead, man.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.076
- David?
- Hm?

12:24.109 --> 12:24.944
Wake up.

12:25.910 --> 12:26.811
We've got company.

12:27.913 --> 12:28.880
- Company?
- Yeah.

12:28.913 --> 12:29.981
People.

12:30.014 --> 12:30.816
Four of them.

12:30.849 --> 12:32.184
One's got on a mask.

12:32.216 --> 12:33.184
A mask?

12:33.217 --> 12:35.419
Yeah, like a burn's mask.

12:35.452 --> 12:36.620
What?

12:36.653 --> 12:38.322
I thought you said no one's
supposed to come out here.

12:38.355 --> 12:39.591
Well, I didn't think there
would be.

12:40.792 --> 12:41.627
Shit.

12:45.029 --> 12:45.898
How many people?

12:45.931 --> 12:46.865
Like, four of 'em.

12:46.898 --> 12:47.699
Four?

12:47.731 --> 12:48.567
Thanks.

12:51.403 --> 12:52.238
Coming.

12:57.308 --> 12:58.142
Hi.

12:58.176 --> 12:58.977
- Hi.
- Morning.

12:59.009 --> 12:59.812
- Morning.
- We just thought we'd

12:59.845 --> 13:01.113
come over and introduce
ourselves.

13:01.145 --> 13:02.514
I'm Nelly, this is my sister
Becca,

13:02.547 --> 13:07.552
that's our Elmer over there
and Amy just behind him.

13:07.586 --> 13:08.620
Hey.

13:08.653 --> 13:10.688
I'm David.

13:10.721 --> 13:14.225
This is Mary who's not
dressed so much right now.

13:14.259 --> 13:15.060
Hi Mary.

13:15.092 --> 13:16.260
Hi Mary.

13:16.293 --> 13:17.228
Hello.

13:17.261 --> 13:19.530
Look, I know this is a bit
inconvenient.

13:19.563 --> 13:20.832
We're not usually the type to
intrude

13:20.865 --> 13:22.400
on personal camping space.

13:22.433 --> 13:23.701
It's just that this particular
spot,

13:23.735 --> 13:26.871
it's pretty special to us, you
know?

13:26.904 --> 13:30.208
So I thought that maybe we could
just...

13:30.241 --> 13:31.843
Right, yeah, of course.

13:31.876 --> 13:33.144
No, that's fine.

13:33.177 --> 13:35.246
As they say me , right?

13:35.279 --> 13:36.148
Right, yeah.

13:36.181 --> 13:37.349
Thank you for that.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.550
Look, I know you're after
some peace and quiet probably,

13:39.583 --> 13:41.686
- so we'll stay out
- Yeah.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.653
of your hair as much as
possible

13:42.687 --> 13:44.121
and we'll keep the music down.

13:44.154 --> 13:45.356
Oh, that'd be great.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.091
But you know, you
wanna share a campfire,

13:47.125 --> 13:49.861
have a couple of drinks at
any point, totally welcome.

13:49.894 --> 13:51.596
We'd love to spend time with you
guys.

13:51.629 --> 13:52.965
Oh, that's really
nice of you, thank you.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.700
Okay, we better let you go.

13:54.732 --> 13:55.533
Okay.

13:55.567 --> 13:57.034
Okay.

13:57.067 --> 13:57.903
Bye.

14:00.971 --> 14:02.673
Did you just say that I wasn't
dressed?

14:02.706 --> 14:03.508
What, I just woke up?

14:03.541 --> 14:05.277
My brain is not working yet.

14:05.309 --> 14:06.978
Okay, so what do you wanna do?

14:07.011 --> 14:08.713
What do you mean?

14:08.746 --> 14:09.548
Forget it.

14:09.581 --> 14:10.950
Do you want coffee?

14:19.390 --> 14:20.825
Oi!

14:21.692 --> 14:23.194
What are you doing?

14:23.227 --> 14:24.295
Nothing.

14:24.328 --> 14:26.899
Well, what are they
doing?

14:26.932 --> 14:29.067
Sitting, drinking.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.903
Do you wanna call the
cops or do you want me to?

14:30.936 --> 14:31.971
Shut up.

14:32.004 --> 14:34.673
You know the red head
did disappear though, so.

14:34.706 --> 14:35.740
Who, Becca?

14:35.774 --> 14:36.942
Becca?

14:36.975 --> 14:38.777
What, I've got a good memory.

14:38.809 --> 14:39.610
She's probably off killing a
kangaroo

14:39.644 --> 14:41.279
with her bare hands to be
honest.

14:45.984 --> 14:47.753
Are you all right?

14:47.785 --> 14:48.953
No, I don't think so.

14:50.054 --> 14:50.855
Well, go sit outside.

14:50.889 --> 14:52.091
I don't want to.

14:53.057 --> 14:53.859
Then look at me.

14:53.892 --> 14:54.693
No.

14:54.725 --> 14:55.559
- Come on.
- No.

15:10.908 --> 15:13.345
Is it just me or is this
whole thing really weird?

15:14.346 --> 15:15.179
Yeah, I guess.

15:15.214 --> 15:16.114
I mean we're out in the bush,
babe.

15:16.147 --> 15:17.482
People are weird out here.

15:17.514 --> 15:19.884
Yeah, but who's the guy
in relation to the girls?

15:19.918 --> 15:21.519
Are they like family?

15:21.552 --> 15:24.322
Yeah, that kinda makes sense I
suppose.

15:26.557 --> 15:28.693
Come on, let's go take some
pictures.

15:29.793 --> 15:30.828
I don't want to.

15:30.861 --> 15:32.730
Suit yourself.

15:32.764 --> 15:34.166
You're going?

15:34.198 --> 15:35.132
Yeah, I didn't come out all

15:35.166 --> 15:37.035
this way to be imprisoned in a
caravan.

15:37.067 --> 15:38.437
Yeah but neither did I.

15:38.470 --> 15:39.437
So, come.

15:39.471 --> 15:40.972
Forget about it.

15:44.341 --> 15:45.143
I love ya.

15:45.176 --> 15:47.112
I love you too.

15:47.144 --> 15:48.212
But don't be long.

16:42.933 --> 16:44.336
Hey, Mary, right?

16:44.369 --> 16:45.170
- Yeah.
- Nelly.

16:45.202 --> 16:46.337
It's nice to properly meet you.

16:46.370 --> 16:47.372
Oh, yeah, you too.

16:48.807 --> 16:49.841
Look, I know this might sound

16:49.875 --> 16:50.875
a bit weird but we've
just bought an entire slab

16:50.908 --> 16:52.943
of beer and it turns out
they're not twist tops,

16:52.976 --> 16:54.745
so I'm wondering if you
have a bottle opener

16:54.778 --> 16:56.313
- that maybe we can borrow.
- Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:56.346 --> 16:57.615
- Oh, great.
- One second.

17:00.150 --> 17:00.951
- Thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

17:00.985 --> 17:02.421
Oh, life saver.

17:02.453 --> 17:04.855
You guys can hold onto
it 'til you guys head out.

17:04.888 --> 17:05.689
Really?

17:05.722 --> 17:06.524
- Yeah, really.
- Oh, well,

17:06.557 --> 17:07.358
we're here 'til Monday.

17:07.392 --> 17:08.794
- Oh, us too.
- Oh, great.

17:08.826 --> 17:10.295
Perfect.

17:10.327 --> 17:11.762
Look, I'm really sorry again
about

17:11.796 --> 17:13.164
the positioning of our campsite.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.434
I know it's not ideal.

17:15.467 --> 17:16.601
It's just that this is kind

17:16.634 --> 17:18.002
of a family tradition spot for
us.

17:18.036 --> 17:19.104
Oh yeah?

17:19.136 --> 17:20.105
You guys are all family?

17:20.137 --> 17:21.205
We are, different dads.

17:21.239 --> 17:23.708
Yeah, I know it's a bit silly
but it means

17:23.740 --> 17:25.844
that we all get here together
once

17:25.876 --> 17:27.578
a year at least so that's nice.

17:27.612 --> 17:28.613
- Yeah.
- Especially for Amy.

17:28.645 --> 17:31.950
She's had a really
challenging life actually,

17:31.982 --> 17:33.951
so it's nice to get her out.

17:33.984 --> 17:35.886
Yeah, no, I totally get that.

17:35.920 --> 17:36.721
Yeah.

17:36.753 --> 17:38.423
But I don't really
wanna put you on

17:38.455 --> 17:40.759
the spot but she actually
doesn't really get

17:40.791 --> 17:43.194
to meet too many new
people so I was wondering

17:43.228 --> 17:44.229
- if maybe you wouldn't mind
- Oh, yeah.

17:44.262 --> 17:45.930
Coming and
saying hello or something.

17:45.963 --> 17:48.200
Yeah, I, yeah, I could
definitely do that.

17:48.232 --> 17:49.201
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

17:49.233 --> 17:50.568
- Oh, that would be great.
- One sec, though.

17:50.602 --> 17:51.403
- Is that, yeah?
- Yeah, okay.

17:51.435 --> 17:52.570
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thank you.

18:06.116 --> 18:07.318
What ya doin'?

18:11.855 --> 18:12.924
Just messing around.

18:18.429 --> 18:20.565
Are you a professional?

18:20.597 --> 18:21.532
No, no, no, no.

18:21.566 --> 18:24.803
A budding amateur with
an expensive camera.

18:24.836 --> 18:25.703
One of those guys.

18:25.737 --> 18:26.571
Oh, yeah?

18:26.604 --> 18:27.404
You shoot anything else other

18:27.438 --> 18:29.241
than trees and rocks and stuff?

18:30.575 --> 18:32.544
Anything that catches
the eye.

18:36.614 --> 18:37.749
Do I catch your eye?

18:42.119 --> 18:43.854
I mean, will you shoot me?

18:45.557 --> 18:46.357
Shoot you?

18:46.391 --> 18:47.493
Yeah, of course.

18:48.459 --> 18:49.661
- If you just, if I could...
- Oh no, no, no, not here.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.195
There's a great little spot.

18:51.229 --> 18:52.631
It's like five minutes from
here.

18:52.663 --> 18:54.465
It'll make the perfect backdrop.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.101
I'd love to.

18:57.134 --> 18:57.935
I kinda promised Mary

18:57.969 --> 18:59.571
- I'd be back...
- We'll be quick.

18:59.604 --> 19:00.439
Real quick.

19:01.405 --> 19:02.874
I promise.

19:02.906 --> 19:03.741
Come on.

19:07.311 --> 19:08.312
Oh, Jesus.

19:11.816 --> 19:13.117
She doesn't talk much.

19:13.151 --> 19:13.986
Okay.

19:15.553 --> 19:17.355
Hey, Amy, this is Mary.

19:17.387 --> 19:18.689
Wanted to say hi.

19:20.157 --> 19:20.992
Hi Amy.

19:22.059 --> 19:24.296
I really like your dress.

19:24.328 --> 19:25.763
Are you enjoying camping?

19:27.397 --> 19:28.199
Yeah?

19:28.232 --> 19:29.033
Me too.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.102
It's really pretty out here,
huh?

19:31.134 --> 19:32.470
Maybe Sweetheart wants to say
something.

19:32.502 --> 19:34.005
That's her puppet, Sweetheart.

19:36.874 --> 19:38.108
Hey.

19:38.142 --> 19:39.076
I'm Elmer.

19:39.109 --> 19:39.944
Hi.

19:41.144 --> 19:42.346
I'm Mary.

19:42.380 --> 19:43.215
Nice to meet you.

19:45.616 --> 19:46.718
Nice to meet you, Mary.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.353
I gotta go back to it.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.759
Amy, why don't
you tell Mary what you do.

19:54.791 --> 19:56.727
She's been studying massage
therapy.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.195
That's really cool, Amy.

19:58.229 --> 20:00.665
There's nothin' better
than a good massage, right?

20:01.965 --> 20:03.400
She really enjoys it.

20:03.433 --> 20:05.103
You know, my shoulders
have really been killing me.

20:05.135 --> 20:07.771
Maybe you could give me a
massage later?

20:07.805 --> 20:09.507
I could pay you 20 bucks even.

20:09.539 --> 20:11.175
First paid job?

20:11.209 --> 20:12.376
What do you say about that?

20:12.410 --> 20:13.412
Sound okay?

20:15.113 --> 20:18.917
Hey, can I ask you somethin'?

20:18.950 --> 20:20.518
Amy?

20:20.550 --> 20:22.354
It's a skin disease
she was born with.

20:22.386 --> 20:23.989
She's never really
come to terms with it.

20:24.021 --> 20:26.023
That's why she covers herself
up.

20:26.057 --> 20:27.625
She's really self conscious.

20:27.659 --> 20:28.793
Yeah, right.

20:28.826 --> 20:30.261
I mean, to the world she's
different.

20:30.295 --> 20:33.632
To us she's special but to her
she's ugly.

20:34.598 --> 20:35.399
Come on.

20:35.432 --> 20:36.268
It's just down here.

20:46.310 --> 20:47.211
What do you think?

20:49.913 --> 20:50.749
Very nice.

20:54.184 --> 20:55.419
So where do we start?

20:56.387 --> 20:58.189
I don't know, I don't do
modeling stuff.

20:59.022 --> 21:02.093
Maybe stand on the rock
and I'll take some photos.

21:08.532 --> 21:09.433
- Ready?
- Yeah.

21:15.573 --> 21:17.209
So tell me about yourself,
David.

21:18.175 --> 21:19.009
All right.

21:19.042 --> 21:21.479
I was born and raised in
Melbourne.

21:23.213 --> 21:24.448
I studied graphic design.

21:26.817 --> 21:29.621
Got a job at a call center which
sucked.

21:32.890 --> 21:34.859
Met Mary at a friend's party.

21:34.892 --> 21:35.727
That went well.

21:37.428 --> 21:40.666
House, marriage, kids?

21:42.133 --> 21:43.634
If I play my cards
right.

21:55.712 --> 21:56.548
How's this?

21:59.282 --> 22:00.184
What about you?

22:00.218 --> 22:02.954
You got kids, boyfriend?

22:04.521 --> 22:05.956
No, I'm single.

22:05.990 --> 22:06.790
Well, I'm sure you won't have

22:06.824 --> 22:08.460
too much trouble finding a man.

22:09.359 --> 22:10.194
Thanks.

22:11.828 --> 22:14.832
Though, I'm assuming seeing
as you don't know me,

22:14.865 --> 22:16.734
that comment's based on my outer
beauty.

22:19.770 --> 22:20.605
You know what?

22:20.637 --> 22:21.505
I think I've got some good ones

22:21.538 --> 22:23.775
if you wanna come
and have a look.

22:23.807 --> 22:24.709
Yeah, cool.

22:27.111 --> 22:29.347
Oh.

22:29.380 --> 22:30.949
Do you reckon I look fat?

22:30.981 --> 22:32.083
No.

22:32.115 --> 22:33.917
What about behind my legs?

22:33.951 --> 22:35.185
Do you think they look fat?

22:35.219 --> 22:36.187
No, legs are good.

22:36.220 --> 22:38.088
You know, I think we've
got some good ones here.

22:38.122 --> 22:39.223
We should probably go.

22:39.257 --> 22:42.760
Hey, I was wondering, I
wanted to ask you a favor.

22:42.794 --> 22:45.730
I mean, I'm not gonna
have this body forever,

22:45.762 --> 22:50.769
and so I was hoping I could
get some 100% me photos.

22:53.570 --> 22:54.405
Uh...

22:56.540 --> 22:59.778
Come on, it'd just be two
adults, completely professional.

23:00.778 --> 23:02.646
I won't tell Mary, I promise.

23:16.093 --> 23:17.195
Amy!

23:17.228 --> 23:18.596
It's rude to stare.

23:18.628 --> 23:20.197
Oh, don't worry about it, it's
fine.

23:20.230 --> 23:22.032
It's not, she's gotta learn.

23:23.867 --> 23:25.269
This feels really great, Amy.

23:25.303 --> 23:26.337
Thank you so much.

23:26.369 --> 23:27.838
Look who found each other.

23:28.673 --> 23:29.740
Hey, honey.

23:29.773 --> 23:31.308
Hey, what's goin' on here?

23:31.342 --> 23:33.244
So, Amy's going to massage
school

23:33.277 --> 23:34.746
so she's giving me a neck
massage.

23:34.778 --> 23:36.114
It's really good.

23:36.146 --> 23:36.947
It looks relaxing.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.583
Amy, I'm David.

23:38.615 --> 23:39.451
Beer?

23:40.284 --> 23:41.453
Yeah, sure.

23:43.354 --> 23:45.155
So, you must be Mary.

23:45.189 --> 23:46.124
Becca, I'm guessing?

23:46.156 --> 23:47.925
Yeah, it's really nice to meet
you.

23:47.959 --> 23:49.227
Yeah, you too.

23:49.259 --> 23:50.461
Hey, mate.

23:50.494 --> 23:52.296
You wanna come fishing?

23:52.329 --> 23:53.298
You know, this beer
actually sounds pretty good.

23:53.330 --> 23:55.599
I might just put my feet
up if that's all right.

23:55.633 --> 23:57.469
Okay.

23:57.501 --> 23:58.636
You miss out.

23:59.670 --> 24:00.471
Sweet.

24:00.505 --> 24:01.573
So how'd the photos go?

24:01.605 --> 24:02.473
Yeah, good.

24:02.507 --> 24:04.075
I got some good ones.

24:04.107 --> 24:04.942
Yeah?

24:04.976 --> 24:06.211
Can I see 'em?

24:06.243 --> 24:08.312
The battery died.

24:08.346 --> 24:11.082
Just stupid trees and bugs and
stuff,

24:11.115 --> 24:12.616
you know, standard.

24:15.118 --> 24:17.154
I was in a middle of surgery,
right?

24:17.188 --> 24:19.290
I get this call that my
neighbor's on the photo frantic

24:19.323 --> 24:21.526
and she says, "There's a man
trying

24:21.558 --> 24:23.560
"to call into your
skylight in his underwear.

24:23.594 --> 24:24.962
"Should I call the police?"

24:24.996 --> 24:26.998
I'm like, "No, that's
obviously my boyfriend

24:27.030 --> 24:29.567
"who yet again locked
himself outside of the house

24:29.599 --> 24:33.070
"without keys this time in his
underwear."

24:33.104 --> 24:34.372
She was bein' dramatic.

24:34.404 --> 24:35.272
Yeah, okay.

24:35.306 --> 24:37.142
It was really funny, right?

24:38.675 --> 24:41.412
So, I've been meaning to
ask, what's with the tattoos?

24:41.444 --> 24:43.280
Are they all the same?

24:43.314 --> 24:44.315
Uh...

24:44.347 --> 24:45.716
Yeah.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.352
Yeah, family tradition.

24:47.384 --> 24:49.653
Are they like Egyptian or?

24:49.686 --> 24:50.487
No.

24:50.520 --> 24:51.822
Our mom's an artist.

24:51.855 --> 24:55.058
You know, she just created
this like family crest.

24:55.092 --> 24:56.261
You know, something like that.

24:56.294 --> 24:57.929
It keeps us all connected.

24:59.931 --> 25:01.231
She's a bit of a hippy.

25:01.265 --> 25:02.400
We play along.

25:02.432 --> 25:04.536
All right, who's got a scary
story?

25:04.568 --> 25:06.904
Feels like a scary story kinda
night?

25:06.938 --> 25:09.040
Yeah, I could definitely
go for a scary story.

25:09.073 --> 25:09.874
Who's got one?

25:09.906 --> 25:10.875
I could show you my bank
account.

25:10.907 --> 25:12.509
Why, how much you got?

25:12.542 --> 25:14.578
Elmer!

25:14.612 --> 25:16.014
I got one.

25:16.047 --> 25:16.847
Yeah?

25:16.881 --> 25:18.483
Love it, let's hear it.

25:18.516 --> 25:20.951
So, there's this woman.

25:20.984 --> 25:22.819
Her name's Sally Anderson.

25:22.853 --> 25:24.822
She's a single mom, she's got a
daughter.

25:24.855 --> 25:25.890
Daughter's name's Emily.

25:25.923 --> 25:28.292
She's the cutest little
thing you ever seen.

25:28.326 --> 25:30.495
Eight, maybe nine years old.

25:30.528 --> 25:33.030
So one day she says, "Hey,
honey put on some shoes.

25:33.064 --> 25:35.432
"Mommy's gotta go to the post
office."

25:35.465 --> 25:36.867
She's like, "Oh, Mom, come on.

25:36.901 --> 25:39.437
"I'm old enough,
I'm big enough now.

25:39.470 --> 25:41.538
"Let me stay home."

25:41.571 --> 25:43.574
Sally thinks, yeah, okay.

25:43.607 --> 25:44.808
Sure.

25:44.842 --> 25:46.644
I'll give her this chance.

25:46.676 --> 25:47.878
See how she goes.

25:50.381 --> 25:51.983
So she says to her,

25:52.016 --> 25:54.586
"You're to sit here and
be a good girl, okay?

25:54.618 --> 25:57.321
"Don't go anywhere, just
watch your cartoons.

25:57.355 --> 25:58.789
"I'll be right back.

25:58.823 --> 25:59.958
"Promise me?"

25:59.990 --> 26:01.158
She says, "Yes, Mom.

26:01.192 --> 26:02.859
"Of course, I promise."

26:02.893 --> 26:06.230
So, she gives her a kiss
goodbye,

26:06.262 --> 26:08.532
locks the front door and off she
goes.

26:09.634 --> 26:12.636
Now little Emily,
she's a good girl.

26:12.670 --> 26:15.473
She just sits there watching her
cartoons.

26:16.807 --> 26:18.643
Not a care in the world.

26:20.377 --> 26:23.847
Little does she know that
there's something in the house.

26:23.881 --> 26:24.916
Oblivious.

26:26.049 --> 26:26.884
Closer.

26:28.752 --> 26:29.854
Closer and closer.

26:33.590 --> 26:34.858
And then she feels it.

26:34.892 --> 26:37.595
Just a tiny little
prick on her toe.

26:37.627 --> 26:40.965
So she's screaming,
terrified, panicking.

26:42.932 --> 26:46.336
So she runs to the phone, hands
trembling.

26:46.369 --> 26:47.204
She's too late.

26:49.140 --> 26:50.508
Muscle spasms kick in.

26:52.442 --> 26:54.045
She falls hard.

26:56.980 --> 27:01.653
Screaming on her way down
as loud as her lungs can

27:02.686 --> 27:04.621
hoping somebody will hear her.

27:04.654 --> 27:05.757
Maybe the neighbor.

27:08.491 --> 27:13.498
Unfortunately for Emily her
Mom got held up, 45 minutes.

27:14.397 --> 27:15.866
So when she comes home,

27:15.900 --> 27:20.105
she sees her lying on
the tiles, body stiff,

27:22.272 --> 27:27.278
vomit everywhere, eyes wide
open staring at the television.

27:32.450 --> 27:34.552
The neighbor wasn't 20 feet a
way.

27:34.585 --> 27:35.653
They shared a wall.

27:37.354 --> 27:40.525
She was listening to
headphones, music on full blast.

27:40.557 --> 27:41.792
Didn't hear a damn thing.

27:44.761 --> 27:47.164
The hospital wasn't even 10
minutes away.

27:52.702 --> 27:54.172
Australian funnel web spider.

27:55.638 --> 27:56.807
That's horrible.

27:57.875 --> 27:59.210
So right now in these woods

27:59.242 --> 28:00.544
there's thousands of them.

28:01.746 --> 28:02.947
They're all around us.

28:05.583 --> 28:08.820
And we are very, very far from
hospital.

28:17.027 --> 28:18.196
A toast.

28:20.463 --> 28:23.900
To never listening to music

28:23.933 --> 28:25.702
on full blast with headphones
again.

28:27.238 --> 28:28.038
Cheers.

28:28.071 --> 28:30.340
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

28:33.009 --> 28:34.479
I think I'm gonna call it.

28:36.480 --> 28:37.481
Night everyone.

28:37.515 --> 28:38.616
- Goodnight.
- Night.

28:40.584 --> 28:43.019
All right, who's up for
another round?

28:43.053 --> 28:43.888
Fuckin' oath.

28:43.921 --> 28:45.389
Yeah.

28:45.422 --> 28:46.758
What?

29:49.420 --> 29:50.255
Amy?

29:51.755 --> 29:53.358
You haven't seen David have you?

30:28.858 --> 30:30.528
He's gone bye bye.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.262
David's gone bye bye.

30:32.296 --> 30:33.698
David gone bye bye.

31:49.339 --> 31:52.476
Mary, listen carefully now.

31:53.743 --> 31:57.615
If you try anything silly,
there'll be repercussions.

31:59.215 --> 32:01.618
All you need to do, Mary, is
relax.

32:24.674 --> 32:25.475
Amy!

33:47.124 --> 33:50.060
Amy, is, Amy is he okay?

33:58.067 --> 33:58.903
Amy?

33:59.936 --> 34:01.971
I know you're not like them.

34:02.005 --> 34:03.608
I can see it, I can tell.

34:04.875 --> 34:06.477
You're a good person aren't you?

34:07.443 --> 34:08.878
I need you to help me, okay?

34:08.911 --> 34:10.414
Can you please help me?

34:11.981 --> 34:13.550
Amy, please, please!

34:37.074 --> 34:37.875
Let's go.

34:40.677 --> 34:41.479
Move it!

34:47.483 --> 34:48.284
Move!

35:00.130 --> 35:00.931
Inside.

35:16.413 --> 35:17.248
This way.

35:22.952 --> 35:23.753
Move!

35:27.958 --> 35:28.925
Two minutes.

36:01.291 --> 36:02.126
Ah!

36:05.896 --> 36:07.932
Come on.

40:50.280 --> 40:51.115
What?

40:57.052 --> 40:58.721
You gotta untie me.

40:58.755 --> 41:00.023
Hey, no, this one, this one.

41:00.056 --> 41:01.758
Quickly, go back outside.

41:01.791 --> 41:03.460
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

41:03.492 --> 41:06.329
Mary, stay here, stay here.

41:06.362 --> 41:07.163
Wait.

41:57.646 --> 42:02.253
Baby, baby, baby.

42:19.668 --> 42:20.536
What did I say?

42:20.570 --> 42:22.405
What did I fucking say, huh?

42:22.438 --> 42:24.273
- Aw, baby!
- Get the fuck off her!

42:24.306 --> 42:25.308
Get off her!

42:28.478 --> 42:30.012
Watch!

42:30.045 --> 42:31.948
Get off her!

42:31.981 --> 42:33.650
Get off me you crazy bitch!

42:33.682 --> 42:35.552
Get the fuck off her!

42:35.585 --> 42:37.086
I'll fuckin' kill you!

42:37.119 --> 42:38.521
No!

42:38.554 --> 42:39.355
No!

42:39.389 --> 42:40.557
No!

42:40.590 --> 42:41.425
No!

42:44.393 --> 42:45.795
Fuck off!

42:45.829 --> 42:46.630
No, no!

42:48.063 --> 42:49.231
Get out of here!

42:49.264 --> 42:50.333
Get out of here!

42:50.367 --> 42:52.202
No, no, no, no, no!

42:52.235 --> 42:53.003
No, no, no, no, no!

42:53.036 --> 42:53.936
Get off!

42:56.106 --> 42:56.941
No, no!

43:04.414 --> 43:05.249
No!

43:06.181 --> 43:07.550
No!

43:07.583 --> 43:09.185
No!

43:09.219 --> 43:10.586
No!

43:10.619 --> 43:11.454
David!

43:12.489 --> 43:13.423
No, no, no!

43:15.224 --> 43:16.159
No, no, no!

43:17.260 --> 43:18.162
Get back to bed!

43:19.195 --> 43:22.565
I'm gonna hurt him
everyday and so will them.

43:24.733 --> 43:26.235
And I'm gonna show you so

43:26.268 --> 43:28.204
that you know what you've done
here.

43:31.474 --> 43:32.476
Put her in the box.

43:34.811 --> 43:35.813
No, David!

43:37.347 --> 43:38.849
No!

43:38.882 --> 43:40.083
David!

43:50.559 --> 43:51.394
No!

43:52.295 --> 43:53.163
Fuck you!

43:53.195 --> 43:54.331
Get in the box!

43:54.364 --> 43:56.400
- Get in the box!
- In the box!

43:56.432 --> 43:57.266
Move, now!

43:59.402 --> 44:03.139
Get in there!

44:03.172 --> 44:03.973
Nighty night.

44:05.641 --> 44:07.443
Let me out!

44:07.476 --> 44:08.911
Help!

44:08.945 --> 44:09.780
Help!

44:12.047 --> 44:13.582
Let me out!

44:13.615 --> 44:15.152
David!

44:15.184 --> 44:16.552
- David!
- Woo!

44:16.585 --> 44:19.022
Let me the fuck out!

44:19.989 --> 44:21.525
Help!

44:21.557 --> 44:23.092
Please!

44:23.126 --> 44:25.062
- Please!
- I told you to play good,

44:25.094 --> 44:26.262
stupid bitch.

44:26.295 --> 44:27.897
Please!

44:27.931 --> 44:28.932
Please help!

44:30.400 --> 44:31.235
Help!

44:34.003 --> 44:34.905
Let me out!

44:36.172 --> 44:37.074
Let me out!

44:38.942 --> 44:39.777
Help!

44:40.943 --> 44:41.878
Let me out!

44:43.045 --> 44:44.380
Help!

44:44.414 --> 44:45.249
Help!

44:46.715 --> 44:47.617
Let me out!

44:48.851 --> 44:49.652
Let me out!

45:13.909 --> 45:15.444
No, no.

45:15.478 --> 45:16.646
Stay away!

45:16.679 --> 45:18.315
Stay away!

45:18.347 --> 45:20.916
Get the fuck away from me.

45:20.949 --> 45:21.884
Get away!

45:23.719 --> 45:25.821
Please, get away!

45:25.855 --> 45:27.423
Stop it!

45:27.456 --> 45:28.257
Oh!

45:28.291 --> 45:29.092
Oh, yeah.

45:49.077 --> 45:50.413
There's your shower.

45:52.581 --> 45:53.416
And your toilet.

45:55.018 --> 45:56.353
You've lost all privileges.

46:04.293 --> 46:07.596
Mary, see this?

46:07.630 --> 46:09.398
Take a good look.

46:11.800 --> 46:13.836
I'm gonna put it on the wall.

46:14.737 --> 46:16.740
Everyday you'll get a new photo.

46:16.773 --> 46:20.611
Little reminder of what you did.

46:21.610 --> 46:24.181
You want me to stop hurting him,
Mary,

46:24.213 --> 46:25.548
then you'll be a good girl.

46:28.952 --> 46:30.086
Take their stuff.

46:42.364 --> 46:44.167
Take that fucking arm.

46:47.936 --> 46:49.306
Ah!

46:49.338 --> 46:51.440
It's your arm or his.

47:01.284 --> 47:02.085
Bye bye.

47:08.590 --> 47:12.795
Keep your head down, play
nice,

47:12.829 --> 47:15.164
otherwise I'll start sending him
photos.

47:52.869 --> 47:53.670
Dinner.

48:10.954 --> 48:13.390
You know, you're very pretty.

48:17.793 --> 48:19.161
Come here.

48:19.195 --> 48:19.996
Get out.

49:08.411 --> 49:09.246
Get out!

49:10.079 --> 49:11.347
Get out!

49:11.380 --> 49:12.181
Get out!

49:13.181 --> 49:14.750
Stay away.

49:14.784 --> 49:17.153
Stay away from me!

49:17.186 --> 49:18.655
Stay!

49:18.688 --> 49:20.123
Get away from me!

49:20.155 --> 49:21.690
Let go!

49:21.724 --> 49:23.293
No!

49:23.326 --> 49:24.126
No!

50:01.731 --> 50:02.666
Thank you, Amy.

50:08.103 --> 50:09.905
You can look at me you know?

50:13.309 --> 50:14.411
I, I don't bite.

50:22.284 --> 50:24.653
You and me are kind of alike,
huh?

50:32.961 --> 50:34.931
You look very tired.

50:37.733 --> 50:38.568
I am.

50:41.003 --> 50:45.976
Well, David told Nelly
that you have insomnia.

50:48.844 --> 50:50.179
Is that true?

50:50.213 --> 50:51.448
Sometimes, yeah.

50:52.614 --> 50:54.116
Amy wants to help Mary.

50:56.719 --> 50:59.588
Amy brought you some sleeping
tablets.

51:05.760 --> 51:06.829
You should take them.

51:07.762 --> 51:08.965
Helps you sleep.

51:08.998 --> 51:11.634
Yeah, I'll take 'em later,
thank you.

51:11.666 --> 51:13.569
Wait, you should take them
now.

51:13.603 --> 51:14.771
It takes a bit to work.

51:19.541 --> 51:20.543
You don't trust Amy?

51:21.744 --> 51:22.612
You don't want her to help.

51:22.644 --> 51:25.614
No, no, I want her help.

51:25.648 --> 51:27.951
When then you should take the
medicine.

51:27.983 --> 51:30.119
It'll help you sleep,
make you feel better.

51:31.019 --> 51:32.288
Yeah, okay.

52:03.619 --> 52:04.954
Do you play chess?

52:39.688 --> 52:42.257
Can I tell you something?

52:42.291 --> 52:43.126
Sure.

52:45.795 --> 52:47.864
Amy thinks you're really
pretty.

52:49.498 --> 52:50.833
I think she's pretty too.

52:52.835 --> 52:54.470
Do you think that maybe I could
talk

52:54.503 --> 52:56.039
just to Amy for a little
while, Sweetheart?

52:56.072 --> 52:56.907
No.

52:57.873 --> 52:58.974
Amy's too shy.

53:00.675 --> 53:01.476
Okay.

53:10.353 --> 53:14.624
You know, I know what it's
like to be different too.

53:14.657 --> 53:16.359
To be the odd one out.

53:16.391 --> 53:17.226
It's tough.

53:18.527 --> 53:19.829
Scary sometimes.

53:21.297 --> 53:22.199
A lot of the time.

53:23.733 --> 53:26.568
Scary wondering what people
are thinking about you.

53:26.601 --> 53:28.904
Scary trying to figure
out how you should act.

53:30.672 --> 53:32.841
Wanna know what I learned
growing up, though?

53:34.076 --> 53:37.213
No matter what you think about
yourself,

53:37.246 --> 53:40.349
what you think others think
about you, you're better.

53:41.951 --> 53:44.521
You're capable of a lot
more than you think.

53:46.355 --> 53:51.260
Capable of things that are scary
or risky.

53:52.728 --> 53:54.697
You know, when you
start doing those things

53:54.730 --> 53:57.800
you realize that the world can
be a good place for you too.

54:02.438 --> 54:03.606
Can I ask you something?

54:04.907 --> 54:06.142
Yes.

54:08.610 --> 54:09.978
Do you think it's right what

54:10.012 --> 54:12.582
your brother and sisters
are doing to me and David?

54:17.987 --> 54:19.055
I don't think you do.

54:20.789 --> 54:21.757
I think you care.

54:26.728 --> 54:28.030
I think you care about me.

54:29.431 --> 54:32.501
I think you like me
even and I like you too.

54:37.306 --> 54:39.809
I think you're better than all
of them.

54:39.842 --> 54:43.413
I wanna help you get away
from here beyond all of this.

54:45.181 --> 54:48.150
You know your family's
not good for you, right?

54:48.184 --> 54:51.220
Your brother, you hate him and
he's awful.

54:51.253 --> 54:53.923
Your sisters, they treat
you like you're their child.

54:55.224 --> 54:56.393
You're not a child.

54:58.693 --> 54:59.728
Let me help you.

55:01.262 --> 55:03.900
But you have to help me first,
okay?

55:03.932 --> 55:05.335
Can you please help me?

55:06.434 --> 55:07.235
Please?

55:15.110 --> 55:15.944
It's your move.

55:22.385 --> 55:23.186
- Amy?
- Shh!

55:31.893 --> 55:33.829
Listen to me very carefully.

55:34.730 --> 55:36.365
No more talking to Amy.

55:37.432 --> 55:40.402
We play chess, you go to sleep,
that's it.

55:41.903 --> 55:43.172
I know your tricks.

56:06.262 --> 56:08.731
I think I need to go to bed.

56:10.666 --> 56:12.669
We can finish the game
tomorrow.

59:40.141 --> 59:41.476
Got good news.

59:43.579 --> 59:46.916
Got something very
exciting to tell you.

59:57.826 --> 59:59.628
Think I'm gonna call mine Mary.

1:00:03.766 --> 1:00:05.668
So it turns out Amy's not gonna
work

1:00:05.701 --> 1:00:07.235
out on the preggers department.

1:00:08.336 --> 1:00:09.172
This one,

1:00:11.340 --> 1:00:12.175
Mary,

1:00:14.777 --> 1:00:16.112
this one's yours.

1:03:08.516 --> 1:03:09.451
Elmer!

1:03:09.483 --> 1:03:12.221
Elmer!

1:03:13.155 --> 1:03:16.659
Elmer, help me!

1:03:45.119 --> 1:03:46.788
You're a nurse, right?

1:03:46.822 --> 1:03:48.057
I'm a vet nurse, not a
midwife.

1:03:48.090 --> 1:03:49.592
What do we do?

1:03:49.625 --> 1:03:50.559
- Something's wrong.
- Call an ambulance.

1:03:52.260 --> 1:03:53.561
Are you useful or not?

1:03:53.594 --> 1:03:55.964
I'll cut his dick and bring it
in here.

1:03:55.998 --> 1:03:57.398
No, no, fine, fine, fine,
fine.

1:03:57.431 --> 1:04:02.237
Get a pillow and some
towels, sheets and water now!

1:04:02.271 --> 1:04:03.072
Go!

1:04:05.907 --> 1:04:07.476
Leave her!

1:04:07.509 --> 1:04:08.543
I will hurt him more!

1:04:12.047 --> 1:04:13.115
What do we do?

1:04:13.148 --> 1:04:14.416
- What the fuck do we do?
- We have to wash our hands.

1:04:19.121 --> 1:04:22.057
Just breathe, just
breathe, just breathe.

1:04:22.090 --> 1:04:23.626
I'm gonna need her to lay on
her side.

1:04:23.659 --> 1:04:25.094
Becca, lay on your left side.

1:04:26.161 --> 1:04:26.996
I need you to put the sheet

1:04:27.028 --> 1:04:28.396
on the bottom of her body.

1:04:28.429 --> 1:04:30.164
Amy, I'm gonna need you.

1:04:30.197 --> 1:04:31.699
Rub her lower back.

1:04:31.733 --> 1:04:33.335
Give her water when she needs it
okay?

1:04:33.367 --> 1:04:35.003
Push, push!

1:04:35.036 --> 1:04:36.404
You can push, I need you to
relax.

1:04:38.606 --> 1:04:39.442
Nelly!

1:04:40.876 --> 1:04:41.711
Nelly!

1:04:44.179 --> 1:04:45.347
One, two.

1:04:56.123 --> 1:04:57.558
Get the fucking baby out!

1:05:03.532 --> 1:05:04.733
Get the fucking baby!

1:05:04.766 --> 1:05:05.701
Push, push!

1:05:09.170 --> 1:05:10.873
If she dies, you die!

1:05:13.041 --> 1:05:14.710
No, don't touch her!

1:05:18.679 --> 1:05:20.081
Stay away from her!

1:05:23.217 --> 1:05:24.886
Take your hands off of her!

1:05:28.556 --> 1:05:29.391
No!

1:05:30.358 --> 1:05:31.826
No, no!

1:06:42.463 --> 1:06:43.364
No!

1:06:43.398 --> 1:06:44.932
No, no, no, no!

1:06:44.965 --> 1:06:46.201
Fuckin' let go!

1:06:47.668 --> 1:06:48.569
I can't!

1:06:48.603 --> 1:06:49.405
Fuck!

1:07:16.931 --> 1:07:19.434
She was the only one
who really liked me.

1:07:23.304 --> 1:07:24.472
And now she's dead.

1:07:30.244 --> 1:07:31.813
The others hate me.

1:07:37.385 --> 1:07:38.421
Now I've got nothin'.

1:07:42.523 --> 1:07:45.960
That kid, that kid wasn't mine.

1:07:47.996 --> 1:07:48.963
It was gonna be.

1:07:52.134 --> 1:07:53.367
It was gonna be mine.

1:08:02.143 --> 1:08:03.078
Now she's coming.

1:08:07.516 --> 1:08:08.818
She's gonna take it away.

1:08:12.086 --> 1:08:14.355
She's gonna take away
everything.

1:08:15.623 --> 1:08:17.358
Who's coming?

1:08:23.797 --> 1:08:25.199
Why didn't you save her?

1:08:25.233 --> 1:08:26.268
I tried.

1:08:26.301 --> 1:08:28.971
I did, you saw me, I tried.

1:08:29.003 --> 1:08:30.439
You didn't try hard enough.

1:08:31.273 --> 1:08:32.108
I did.

1:08:33.707 --> 1:08:34.643
You didn't!

1:08:38.012 --> 1:08:39.114
Now she's dead!

1:08:40.448 --> 1:08:41.283
Dead!

1:08:43.350 --> 1:08:44.185
You ,

1:08:48.390 --> 1:08:50.592
I said to your boyfriend,

1:08:50.625 --> 1:08:53.162
that if anything ever happened
to Becca,

1:08:55.764 --> 1:08:58.534
I would hurt you very,
very badly.

1:09:03.137 --> 1:09:07.175
And now here we are.

1:09:07.208 --> 1:09:10.378
If you come near my I'll
rip your fucking dick off.

1:09:12.814 --> 1:09:13.649
Come here!

1:09:50.118 --> 1:09:50.919
You fuck!

1:09:54.521 --> 1:09:55.489
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

1:09:55.523 --> 1:09:56.324
whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1:10:56.818 --> 1:10:57.987
Mom!

1:11:01.689 --> 1:11:02.890
She is not yours.

1:11:04.525 --> 1:11:05.426
She's mine.

1:11:06.627 --> 1:11:07.795
Mom!

1:11:22.176 --> 1:11:26.047
Mary, would you step outside
please?

1:11:29.417 --> 1:11:31.486
You have five seconds.

1:11:31.519 --> 1:11:35.257
Otherwise I'm gonna come in
there and shoot you in the face.

1:11:35.289 --> 1:11:36.824
One,

1:11:37.759 --> 1:11:38.560
two.

1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:50.672
Nelly my love, could you
please draw me a hot bath?

1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:55.277
Prep David and begin the meal.

1:11:57.378 --> 1:11:58.212
Yes, Mother.

1:11:59.713 --> 1:12:00.716
Hello, Mary.

1:12:02.449 --> 1:12:04.552
I've heard so much about you and
your man.

1:12:07.188 --> 1:12:09.091
It's very exciting times.

1:12:13.927 --> 1:12:14.829
Beautiful.

1:12:18.432 --> 1:12:21.302
Now, I need you to know,
whatever it was

1:12:22.537 --> 1:12:24.340
they told you happens next,

1:12:27.074 --> 1:12:28.109
it was a lie.

1:12:30.779 --> 1:12:32.247
I'm gonna go inside,

1:12:34.149 --> 1:12:35.451
have myself a bath,

1:12:36.751 --> 1:12:38.087
have my way,

1:12:40.188 --> 1:12:42.056
and just as he finishes,

1:12:43.591 --> 1:12:46.161
I'm going to blow his brains
out.

1:12:49.997 --> 1:12:52.466
Amy, dear, I want you to make
sure

1:12:52.500 --> 1:12:54.936
that Mary is clean for this
evening.

1:12:57.037 --> 1:13:01.175
Feed her, put her in the gold
dress.

1:13:02.810 --> 1:13:05.279
I want her to be perfect for
tonight.

1:14:00.201 --> 1:14:01.036
Amy?

1:14:02.537 --> 1:14:04.039
I don't have a choice anymore.

1:14:05.439 --> 1:14:07.875
I need you to help David
and I escape, okay?

1:14:10.110 --> 1:14:11.680
I need you to unlock me.

1:14:12.747 --> 1:14:14.783
I need you to get the car keys.

1:14:18.752 --> 1:14:22.090
I, I need you to come with us
Amy, okay?

1:14:23.957 --> 1:14:25.726
I want you to come with us.

1:14:28.796 --> 1:14:30.164
You're not like them.

1:14:32.100 --> 1:14:35.270
Don't let them make you like
them.

1:14:37.971 --> 1:14:39.340
You can be a hero.

1:14:40.608 --> 1:14:42.444
You would be my hero, Amy.

1:14:44.444 --> 1:14:46.447
You could have a new life.

1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:47.682
You could come with us.

1:14:48.783 --> 1:14:53.655
A wonderful, amazing new life.

1:14:57.625 --> 1:14:59.862
But it has to happen right now,
okay?

1:15:02.729 --> 1:15:05.299
Don't you want a new life, Amy?

1:15:06.234 --> 1:15:07.869
Do you wanna come with us?

1:17:03.350 --> 1:17:04.185
Stop!

1:17:26.740 --> 1:17:28.010
Drop the gun.

1:17:31.412 --> 1:17:34.148
Make on fucking sound and
I'll blow your brains out.

1:17:37.585 --> 1:17:42.457
Slowly and quietly get off him.

1:17:56.871 --> 1:17:57.672
Down.

1:18:03.877 --> 1:18:05.447
Put your hands up.

1:18:05.479 --> 1:18:07.415
Put your fucking hands up.

1:18:08.850 --> 1:18:09.818
Where's the baby?

1:18:11.185 --> 1:18:12.020
Around.

1:18:13.621 --> 1:18:15.690
Get on the fucking ground.

1:18:15.722 --> 1:18:17.692
Get on the ground.

1:18:21.429 --> 1:18:22.764
Hey babe.

1:18:22.796 --> 1:18:23.997
You're okay.

1:18:24.030 --> 1:18:26.000
It's gonna be okay.

1:18:26.033 --> 1:18:27.001
Shh.

1:18:53.226 --> 1:18:54.595
We gotta go.

1:18:54.628 --> 1:18:55.430
Fuck!

1:20:14.274 --> 1:20:15.409
We gotta go.

1:20:15.443 --> 1:20:17.212
We gotta go.

1:20:17.244 --> 1:20:18.046
Keep going.

1:20:23.384 --> 1:20:25.619
The key, the key.

1:20:27.020 --> 1:20:27.822
Okay, okay.

1:20:36.730 --> 1:20:38.532
Come on, we gotta go baby.

1:20:38.565 --> 1:20:39.600
Good job, good job.

1:20:39.634 --> 1:20:40.435
It's okay.

1:20:40.467 --> 1:20:41.269
It's okay.

1:20:41.301 --> 1:20:42.336
Yeah, you're doin' great, babe.

1:20:42.369 --> 1:20:44.939
I'm gonna be right back.

1:21:20.173 --> 1:21:21.009
Ask me.

1:21:23.109 --> 1:21:25.947
I've waited nine months
for this, David, come on.

1:21:25.979 --> 1:21:26.814
Ask me.

1:21:29.850 --> 1:21:31.386
You wanna marry me?

1:21:31.418 --> 1:21:32.653
Fuckin' oath.

1:21:51.238 --> 1:21:52.073
Mary!

1:21:53.506 --> 1:21:55.509
Stupid fucking bitch.

1:22:36.583 --> 1:22:37.385
Fuck!

1:22:42.256 --> 1:22:44.125
Please pull over.

1:22:46.359 --> 1:22:47.627
Pull over, babe.

1:22:54.769 --> 1:22:55.837
Okay, okay.

1:23:41.881 --> 1:23:44.384
One last push, one
last push.

1:24:13.146 --> 1:24:14.849
Fuck off you monster!

1:24:14.881 --> 1:24:15.682
Fuck off!

1:24:20.654 --> 1:24:21.956
Push!

1:24:21.988 --> 1:24:22.789
Okay.

1:24:40.608 --> 1:24:43.677
I can see it, I can see it, I
can see it.

1:24:52.520 --> 1:24:55.089
I see it, I see it, you ready?

1:25:03.329 --> 1:25:04.631
I see it, I see it.

1:25:13.106 --> 1:25:14.375
It's almost over.

1:27:42.221 --> 1:27:44.992
Sweetheart's your mommy now.
