00:20.187 --> 00:23.124
She's crashing, BP's falling.
Get Dr. Collier.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.359
- She's on her way.
- What have we got?

00:25.559 --> 00:26.861
BP's dropping. She's in V-tach.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.663
BP's crashing at 90/50.

00:28.863 --> 00:31.265
Give her an amp of epi,
and let's go at 200.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.533
Yes, Doctor.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.535
Epi's in.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.871
- Go ahead.
- Start.

00:38.071 --> 00:39.573
- Clear.
- Clear.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.544
Nothing.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.713
- Again, 300.
- 300.

00:45.913 --> 00:47.882
- 300. Charge.
- Clear.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.085
Blood pressure still dropping.

00:51.585 --> 00:52.586
Nothing.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.389
Doctor.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.959
- Go again.
- 360. Charge.

00:59.159 --> 01:00.461
Clear.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.131
No rhythm.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.072
One more time.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.541
- Charge.
- 360. Charge.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.010
- All right, clear.
- Clear.

01:20.781 --> 01:21.982
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

01:22.483 --> 01:23.284
Jack, where are you?

01:23.484 --> 01:24.785
I'm still on the West Side.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.687
You said you were coming to the hospital.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.990
I'll be there soon.
Is Janet out of surgery yet?

01:29.190 --> 01:32.193
There's been a complication. They're
working on it now.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.663
Listen to me. Do not let anyone near
Janet who doesn't belong there.

01:36.163 --> 01:36.997
What do you mean?

01:37.498 --> 01:38.499
I think she might be in danger.

01:38.699 --> 01:39.300
From whom?

01:39.500 --> 01:40.801
I'll explain when I get there.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.537
- Until then, do not mention this to anyone, okay?
- Okay.

01:43.737 --> 01:44.855
- I'll be there soon.
- Okay.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.057
Give her another amp of epi at 360.

01:47.257 --> 01:48.058
Epi's in.

01:48.559 --> 01:49.810
Clear!

01:57.902 --> 01:58.903
Whose car?

01:59.403 --> 02:01.906
Penticoff was paid to pick
it up and get rid of this.

02:05.409 --> 02:06.961
Oh, my God. Who is it?

02:07.161 --> 02:08.461
That's what you'll find out.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.465
But somehow all of this is
connected to Senator Palmer.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.769
Didn't leave much of his face.

02:14.969 --> 02:17.972
They removed his fingers and teeth.
Is forensics here yet?

02:18.172 --> 02:19.723
Not yet, he's on his way.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.227
Call me as soon as you've got a name.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.518
Nina, I need a favor.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.487
It's starting to add up, Jack.

02:33.687 --> 02:37.074
Don't let anyone know I requisitioned
this for personal use.

02:37.274 --> 02:38.275
Personal use?

02:38.776 --> 02:41.829
Yes, could you please pass me
through to hospital security.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.330
Thank you.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.292
You know Kim's friend, the one
she went out with tonight?

02:46.492 --> 02:48.953
She turned up at St. Mark's ER.
She got hit by a car.

02:49.453 --> 02:50.337
Does she know where Kimberly is?

02:50.838 --> 02:53.340
It's the only chance I've got.
I'm meeting Teri at the hospital now.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.926
Get me that name.
Yes, hello?

02:56.126 --> 02:59.630
My name is Jack Bauer, I'm a federal agent.
I'm coming to you now...

02:59.830 --> 03:02.633
...but I wanted to give you a heads-up
on one of your patients.

03:03.133 --> 03:06.136
I think her life might be in danger.

03:06.637 --> 03:09.557
Yes, I'll be there in 10 minutes.
Her name is Janet York.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.114
Jack requisitioned a chopper
15 minutes ago...

03:17.314 --> 03:19.984
...but he didn't log a destination.
Where's he going?

03:20.484 --> 03:21.485
He's tracking a lead.

03:21.785 --> 03:22.653
Ignoring protocol again.

03:22.987 --> 03:24.789
First he assaults an agent
to avoid lockdown.

03:24.989 --> 03:27.491
Then he breaks a prisoner out of jail.
What's the hell's going on here?

03:27.992 --> 03:29.660
I thought we were suppose to be...

03:29.860 --> 03:31.161
Stop following me, Tony!

03:32.997 --> 03:34.999
I prefer to think of it
as watching your back.

03:35.499 --> 03:37.751
When I need your help, I'll ask for it.

03:56.687 --> 03:59.690
Yeah, we got a little off-schedule,
but we're good now.

03:59.890 --> 04:02.109
Yeah, I know. It's already done.

04:08.699 --> 04:11.168
See what happens when you lie?

04:13.954 --> 04:15.756
Don't ever lie to me, Rick.

04:15.956 --> 04:16.841
I won't.

04:17.041 --> 04:18.425
Oh, I know you won't.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.228
Now bury your friend.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.430
- Where?
- In the ground.

04:51.875 --> 04:52.876
We've got to get out of here.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.178
What do you mean, "we"?

04:54.378 --> 04:56.680
I don't know how you hooked
up with these guys.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.884
They obviously don't trust you. You
just saw Gaines kill your friend.

05:01.084 --> 05:02.386
He's not gonna let you walk away.

05:02.586 --> 05:03.387
Shut up.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.889
The only way either of us
is going to stay alive is if get..

05:06.390 --> 05:07.891
I said shut up!

05:20.154 --> 05:22.656
Sources close to the campaign say
the Senator spent the night...

05:23.157 --> 05:26.744
...working on a party unification speech
which he's set to deliver later...

05:28.245 --> 05:30.914
How did you get past Secret Service?

05:31.114 --> 05:32.416
Good to see you too, Sherry.

05:32.616 --> 05:35.419
You listen. David has to
prep for a breakfast meeting.

05:35.619 --> 05:38.205
And the polls are opening in an hour,
so whatever you're doing...

05:38.405 --> 05:39.707
David asked me to come.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.709
- Why, Carl?
- I don't know.

05:52.803 --> 05:55.389
I gotta get ready, and so do you.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.113
So, what's the big emergency, David?

06:03.614 --> 06:06.350
- Thought we had a game plan.
- We did.

06:06.550 --> 06:09.286
Until I found out that my son lied to me.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.072
That he's been lying for seven years.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.742
What's going on?

06:16.243 --> 06:18.546
Why would Maureen Kingsley...

06:18.746 --> 06:21.599
...run a story this big
unless it were true?

06:21.799 --> 06:24.935
Are you saying you believe her
accusation about Keith?

06:25.135 --> 06:28.972
I'm saying, my son was involved in Gibson's
death and you covered it up.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.926
Not only from the law, from me.

06:34.228 --> 06:34.892
David..

06:34.992 --> 06:40.100
Someone altered the hospital records to
make it look like Keith wasn't involved.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.069
That could only have been you.

06:45.689 --> 06:46.690
Look me in the eye...

06:48.692 --> 06:50.694
...and tell me what happened.

06:53.414 --> 06:54.715
You sure you want to know?

06:54.915 --> 06:57.785
You might not like what you find if
you open that door.

06:59.286 --> 07:01.789
It's already open. I'm listening.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.769
The night Gibson raped Nicole...

07:15.969 --> 07:19.640
...while Sherry was still at the hospital
and you were flying back...

07:20.140 --> 07:21.975
...Keith went to see Gibson.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.413
How do you know this?

07:26.613 --> 07:29.616
Keith told me. Your son came to me, David.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.418
He said Gibson pulled a knife.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.621
I... took him at his word.
It was an accident.

07:34.821 --> 07:36.568
He was defending himself.

07:38.909 --> 07:41.795
So you made it look like...
Keith was never there.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.481
As far as I was concerned, he never was.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.967
Why didn't we just go to the police?

07:47.167 --> 07:50.170
If it really was self-defense, Keith would
have been cleared.

07:50.370 --> 07:53.173
Maybe. But your career
would have been over.

07:53.373 --> 07:54.808
Gibson was white, David.

07:58.312 --> 08:01.398
I still wouldn't have covered it up.

08:01.598 --> 08:05.018
- Are you so sure?
- It was my decision, not yours.

08:10.774 --> 08:13.243
I don't want you anywhere near me...

08:15.863 --> 08:17.865
...or my family, ever again.

08:19.783 --> 08:22.953
You have never needed me more
than you need me now.

08:28.759 --> 08:29.927
Get out.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.220
Before you finish crucifying me...

08:41.972 --> 08:44.057
...save some nails for your wife.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.561
Sherry didn't know anything about this.

08:47.761 --> 08:48.662
No?

08:48.862 --> 08:51.698
How do you think Keith
got to me in the first place?

09:30.153 --> 09:32.656
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

09:34.791 --> 09:36.543
- I said, I don't need..
- I heard.

09:55.145 --> 09:58.065
You think I wanted to leave Janet there?

09:59.349 --> 10:01.068
Everything just got so crazy.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.374
All we had to do was hang out
with you guys.

10:07.574 --> 10:11.361
No one was supposed to get hurt.
None of this was supposed to go down.

10:11.561 --> 10:12.863
What did you think was gonna happen?

10:13.063 --> 10:14.581
I don't know.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.125
Smoking that's really gonna help.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.369
I can't believe this is happening.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.473
It is, and you can sit there
feeling sorry for yourself...

10:22.673 --> 10:26.760
...or you can get up and help me figure
out a way to get us out of here.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.705
- West Side.
- Copy that.

10:54.905 --> 10:55.906
Claude Davenport, Hospital Security.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.207
Jack Bauer.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.209
Thanks for mobilizing on such short notice.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.412
I put a man at each end of the ICU
corridor, it should lock it down.

11:02.612 --> 11:03.914
They know not to let anyone in or out?

11:04.414 --> 11:07.718
Only hospital staff, like you asked.
Wanna let me know what this is about?

11:07.918 --> 11:09.219
I wish I could.

11:10.220 --> 11:11.722
- Teri.
- Jack.

11:13.724 --> 11:16.226
- Thank God.
- It's okay. I'm here now.

11:19.229 --> 11:22.232
Oh, Don't leave me.
Don't ever leave me again, okay?

11:22.432 --> 11:24.735
I promise. I won't leave.

11:25.235 --> 11:28.238
Agent Bauer, I'm gonna be walking
the floor if you need anything.

11:28.438 --> 11:29.656
Thank you, Claude.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.780
It's gonna be okay.

11:40.584 --> 11:43.587
- You gotta tell me about Janet.
- She's stable.

11:44.087 --> 11:46.974
- Can she talk?
- No, not yet.

11:47.174 --> 11:50.127
What did you mean before
about her being in danger?

11:50.327 --> 11:51.128
Danger from whom?

11:51.628 --> 11:53.847
Someone who doesn't want her talking to me.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.649
You must be Jack?

11:55.849 --> 11:59.019
Alan, yeah, this is my husband, Jack.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.021
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.523
Alan's been a great friend tonight, Jack.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.859
I'm glad your daughter's okay.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.694
Thank You. Thank you very much.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.697
Gave us a good scare,
but she pulled through.

12:11.198 --> 12:14.401
When she's up to it, I'm going to
need to ask her a few questions.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.204
Jack, my daughter's been through a lot.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.074
If the doctor says it's okay.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.046
The guys that Kim and Janet
were with tonight...

12:26.246 --> 12:28.607
...Teri told me you didn't know them.

12:28.807 --> 12:31.168
No... no, Janet never mentioned them.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.136
Are you close to Janet?

12:35.138 --> 12:36.023
She's my daughter.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.558
But, you don't know who she goes
out with on a school night?

12:38.758 --> 12:40.685
- Jack?
- No, not tonight, I didn't.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.613
But apparently you didn't either.

12:42.813 --> 12:45.565
- What are you doing?
- Trying to find where our daughter is.

12:45.765 --> 12:46.967
By treating Alan as a suspect?

12:47.067 --> 12:48.106
He can handle a few questions.

12:48.195 --> 12:51.188
Now, you understand that right?
- Our daughter's still missing.

12:51.388 --> 12:51.989
Of course I do.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.658
Alan, would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

12:54.858 --> 12:58.286
Jack, what's going on? I don't
know what you've been doing...

12:58.486 --> 13:01.915
...for the last five hours
, but Alan was with me tonight.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.834
I'm sorry if that makes you feel bad...

13:04.034 --> 13:05.335
Hold on one minute.

13:06.336 --> 13:08.138
I'm here to see my brother.

13:08.338 --> 13:09.840
My bag? I'm not gonna open my briefcase.

13:10.340 --> 13:12.142
I'm here to see my brother.

13:12.342 --> 13:14.845
- What's the problem here?
- There's no problem.

13:15.345 --> 13:16.146
Sir.

13:16.346 --> 13:18.598
What's in the briefcase?

13:18.798 --> 13:21.051
Don't worry about it.

13:21.251 --> 13:22.519
Get off of me!

13:24.354 --> 13:27.357
- What is this?
- It's my medication.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.859
What kind of medication?

13:29.059 --> 13:29.910
Ben?

13:30.110 --> 13:31.244
What is going on?

13:31.444 --> 13:34.113
Virgil's in pain. You aren't
giving him what he needs!

13:34.313 --> 13:36.783
We're taking good care
of your brother. I told you.

13:36.983 --> 13:40.036
His brother's in detox. He's been
trying to sneak him drugs all week.

13:40.537 --> 13:42.188
You guys don't get it!

13:42.388 --> 13:44.040
That's it, out! Let's go!

13:47.544 --> 13:49.045
I'm sorry.

13:54.551 --> 13:55.552
Come on.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.687
What did Carl want?

14:19.192 --> 14:20.694
I know about Keith.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.197
Know what about Keith?

14:26.199 --> 14:30.704
That he went to Carl to cover up
the Gibson boy's death.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.205
Keith was there, wasn't he?

14:32.706 --> 14:36.026
Just because Carl wants to feed
you some story doesn't mean...

14:36.226 --> 14:39.546
Are you sure you're not the one that's
feeding me the story?

14:49.022 --> 14:53.526
The thing I can't understand,
what I keep asking myself...

14:56.029 --> 14:58.281
...is why you hid this from me?

15:04.287 --> 15:07.040
- I wanted to tell you, David, I..
- But you didn't.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.993
- Carl said you'd be exposed!
- Don't put this on Carl!

15:11.494 --> 15:14.497
You keep your own counsel,
Sherry. You always have.

15:16.499 --> 15:20.303
Nothing I say to you is going to make
you feel any better, I know that.

15:20.503 --> 15:24.307
I did what I thought was right,
for our family and for your career.

15:37.354 --> 15:39.322
What about Nicole?

15:44.778 --> 15:46.529
Does she know, too?

15:50.533 --> 15:52.585
We were protecting you.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.721
- Really?
- Yes.

15:54.921 --> 15:57.758
Or protecting your chance to move
into the White House?

15:57.958 --> 16:01.127
I am as ambitious as you are, David.
That's why you married me.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.630
No, I married you because I loved you.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.549
I thought we were working
towards something together.

16:06.749 --> 16:09.102
- We still are.
- It doesn't feel that way.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.437
David.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.776
David, what are you going to do?

16:18.228 --> 16:19.312
I don't know.

16:20.814 --> 16:24.117
David, you can be as angry at me
as you want.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.903
But I'm telling you, we should do
everything we can...

16:27.103 --> 16:29.239
...to keep this thing from coming out.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.660
It's too late for that.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.135
I'm sorry to hear you say that...

16:42.335 --> 16:45.338
...because you'll lose a lot more
than the election if it does.

16:49.142 --> 16:52.145
Are you prepared to send our son to jail?

17:38.625 --> 17:40.543
Everything was always a game with Dan.

17:41.044 --> 17:43.546
He acted like nothing could touch him.

17:43.746 --> 17:45.582
And I bought into it.

17:46.082 --> 17:47.183
So did Janet.

17:47.383 --> 17:49.302
I'd give anything to turn back the clock.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.804
Me, too.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.309
I spend every day trying to get away
from my mother.

17:57.811 --> 18:00.396
Now I can't stop wishing she were here.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.318
God, she must be freaking.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.489
Must be nice, having a mom you like.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.791
You don't like yours?

18:11.991 --> 18:14.277
Not all women are meant to be mothers.

18:16.079 --> 18:19.249
- Sorry.
- It's not your problem.

18:22.252 --> 18:23.286
Rick.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.372
We've got to get out of here.

18:32.929 --> 18:34.214
Come with me.

18:38.384 --> 18:39.385
Let's go.

18:46.109 --> 18:49.195
Leave the shovel, unless you plan
to use it on me.

18:58.371 --> 19:01.791
When I come back, your friend better
be in the ground.

19:19.425 --> 19:22.612
- Myers.
- Any word on the John Doe yet?

19:22.812 --> 19:26.007
Perry estimates the time of death
between 11:00 and 12:00 last night.

19:26.207 --> 19:29.402
Before we were tipped on the Palmer hit.
Is he close to making an ID?

19:29.903 --> 19:31.738
We did sent some tissue samples to the lab.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.773
They're running his DNA
against all databases.

19:33.973 --> 19:34.774
No, that will take too long.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.576
We're going as fast as we can, Jack.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.996
Put Jamey on it, we've got to take
care of this now.

19:40.496 --> 19:42.799
- Did you find Kim?
- No, not yet.

19:42.999 --> 19:44.801
- Is her friend all right?
- She will be.

19:45.001 --> 19:47.837
- How about Teri? How's she holding up?
- She's fine, Nina.

19:48.037 --> 19:50.290
What else is going on over there?

19:50.790 --> 19:53.593
I think I have to apologize for Jack.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.296
You don't have to apologize
for your husband.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.815
We're all... pretty wound up.

19:59.015 --> 20:02.018
Jack's wound up a little
tighter than the rest of us.

20:03.386 --> 20:05.889
No argument here.

20:06.389 --> 20:10.393
I guess I've always accepted it
as an occupational hazard.

20:10.593 --> 20:13.780
I thought you told me that he
sat behind a desk.

20:13.980 --> 20:18.701
The truth is, half the time I don't know
what he's doing. He can't tell me.

20:18.901 --> 20:20.720
It's a security thing.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.739
Must be tough on you.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.658
Sometimes.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.795
But you deal with it.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.681
Right now, he's just worried about Kim.

20:31.881 --> 20:35.551
Hopefully, when Janet wakes up, she'll
be able to tell us where she is.

20:37.553 --> 20:39.088
Yeah.

20:41.507 --> 20:45.345
Look, I gotta go. Call me back as
soon as you've got anything.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.495
Walk with me for a sec.

21:05.999 --> 21:10.503
What is it, Jack?
Why is there all this security here?

21:12.005 --> 21:14.007
Who wants to hurt Janet?

21:18.511 --> 21:22.015
Today someone is going to
try to kill David Palmer.

21:22.215 --> 21:22.816
What?

21:23.016 --> 21:25.018
That's why I was brought in last night.

21:27.020 --> 21:29.422
Why is Janet in danger?

21:29.622 --> 21:32.025
Because she was with Kim.

21:35.028 --> 21:36.529
Our daughter's missing.

21:39.032 --> 21:42.143
Are you saying it relates to an
assassination attempt?

21:42.343 --> 21:45.455
They must know that I've been
assigned to protect Palmer.

21:46.956 --> 21:49.959
And you think this person kidnapped Kim?

21:51.961 --> 21:53.413
Oh, my God.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.885
I'm so sorry.

22:00.386 --> 22:03.473
I know this is all happening because of me.

22:06.726 --> 22:09.896
I've tried to keep a wall
between my work and my family.

22:10.096 --> 22:13.266
The wall's coming down, and now
I don't know what to do.

22:22.692 --> 22:23.693
Okay.

22:32.251 --> 22:35.588
- What do they want from you?
- I don't know yet.

22:35.788 --> 22:36.923
What are the police doing?

22:37.423 --> 22:40.176
I couldn't call them. I can't
without risking Kim's life.

22:40.376 --> 22:44.264
- What if it's too late?
- It's not too late.

22:44.464 --> 22:48.885
Kim is okay. They took her for a reason,
and that was not to hurt her.

22:49.085 --> 22:50.887
- Okay.
- Honey...

22:58.061 --> 23:01.030
...I promise you,
we are going to get her back.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.153
I'm so sorry.

23:33.229 --> 23:34.730
I need you in forensics.

23:35.231 --> 23:36.732
I'm about to crack the outer shell.

23:37.233 --> 23:39.002
You said that two hours ago.

23:39.202 --> 23:41.037
This keycard is our best lead
on the Palmer hit.

23:41.537 --> 23:43.706
I'm not dropping the keycard.
I've called in Milo.

23:43.906 --> 23:46.058
Milo's an outside contractor.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.211
Which is why we can trust him.

23:48.411 --> 23:49.963
I can do this. I'm as good as Milo.

23:50.163 --> 23:53.666
Not with this kind of thing you're not,
and I can't wait.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.836
Jack wants you on this.

24:02.175 --> 24:03.893
I'll brief you on the way.

24:04.093 --> 24:06.596
He thinks it's a male Caucasian...

24:21.577 --> 24:23.579
- Who is it?
- David.

24:27.867 --> 24:31.337
Sorry to wake you like this,
Mike, but something's come up.

24:31.537 --> 24:33.339
I was hoping to keep you out of it.

24:33.539 --> 24:37.543
I'm your Chief of Staff, David.
I shouldn't be kept out of anything.

24:37.743 --> 24:38.678
It was a private matter.

24:38.878 --> 24:42.381
You're running for president.
Nothing's private any more.

24:49.972 --> 24:51.858
Where you going?

24:52.058 --> 24:54.694
They moved Janet upstairs to the ICU.

24:54.894 --> 24:55.862
She's out of recovery?

24:56.062 --> 24:58.614
She's a little groggy, but she's awake.

24:59.115 --> 25:01.951
- Alan, that's wonderful.
- Yeah, thank you.

25:02.151 --> 25:04.170
Alan, I owe you an apology. I'm sorry.

25:04.370 --> 25:08.324
You don't need to be. I understand exactly
what you're going through.

25:10.626 --> 25:12.128
Excuse me.

25:13.129 --> 25:15.181
- Bauer.
- We found something.

25:15.381 --> 25:17.767
X-rays show a surgical pin
in John Doe's ankle.

25:17.967 --> 25:21.120
Turns out it's not standard. It's
custom-made, one-of-a-kind.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.273
That means we can trace it to the
surgeon who implanted it.

25:24.473 --> 25:28.644
Jamey's searching the AMA database,
crosschecking it with the manufacturer.

25:28.844 --> 25:30.897
Hopefully, we'll have this guy's name
within the hour.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.699
Sooner is better. I gotta go.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.901
Call me as soon as you've got something.

25:40.439 --> 25:44.443
The minute Maureen breaks the story,
you'll free-fall in the polls.

25:44.944 --> 25:48.097
Then the media will start
churning this thing, 24/7.

25:48.297 --> 25:51.450
They'll pick you clean, then go to
work on the bones.

25:51.650 --> 25:54.503
Chances are, the party will try to cut bait.

25:54.703 --> 25:59.008
So I'd say you're textbook unelectable.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.013
So I'm right to withdraw from the race.

26:04.213 --> 26:06.157
No, that's the last thing you should do.

26:06.357 --> 26:08.301
You just got through telling me I can't win.

26:08.501 --> 26:10.720
I told you what to expect so you can.

26:11.220 --> 26:15.391
If we handle this right, I think
you can come back from this.

26:16.892 --> 26:17.727
David.

26:19.729 --> 26:22.231
You're the most important
presidential candidate...

26:22.431 --> 26:24.584
...this country's had in a long time.

26:24.784 --> 26:28.621
Like it or not, fair or not,
you're making history.

26:33.909 --> 26:36.912
My son was involved in another man's death.

26:39.248 --> 26:40.550
It was an accident.

26:40.750 --> 26:44.337
Okay, then what if some judge
rules it was...

26:44.537 --> 26:46.339
How do we justify the cover-up?

26:47.340 --> 26:48.841
All of them...

26:50.009 --> 26:52.995
...Sherry, Keith, Nicole...

26:53.195 --> 26:55.982
...kept this from the police.

26:56.182 --> 27:01.070
I don't want to seem crass, but the
important thing is you didn't cover it up.

27:02.071 --> 27:03.572
You didn't know.

27:05.074 --> 27:07.410
What does that say about me?

27:14.583 --> 27:18.087
Not knowing the most important things
about my family.

27:18.287 --> 27:21.257
I'm not saying it's not a hard sell.

27:21.757 --> 27:24.593
The election is still six months away.

27:27.430 --> 27:30.182
The voters know how to forgive.

27:31.517 --> 27:34.520
You just have to know how to ask for it.

27:37.807 --> 27:40.276
Do you still want the job, David?

27:41.777 --> 27:43.279
You know I do.

27:43.479 --> 27:47.366
Then you need to come out
with the story yourself...

27:47.566 --> 27:49.869
...before Maureen Kingsley.

27:52.788 --> 27:56.292
Make it the first thing you say
at the breakfast.

28:05.301 --> 28:08.921
I just don't know how my family's
going to feel about that.

28:09.121 --> 28:12.925
Find out fast, because you can't
do this without them.

28:15.728 --> 28:18.647
When you come clean...

28:19.148 --> 28:21.901
...be damned sure your family is
standing next to you.

28:28.441 --> 28:31.594
I did an extensive neurological exam
which showed no spinal injury.

28:31.794 --> 28:34.947
She suffered multiple fractures,
but nothing she can't recover from.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.249
What went wrong in surgery?

28:36.449 --> 28:39.452
When they tried to stop internal bleeding,
she had a cardiac arrest.

28:39.652 --> 28:40.503
It happens sometimes.

28:41.003 --> 28:42.305
But she's okay now?

28:42.505 --> 28:45.541
The next six hours will be
critical, but I'm optimistic.

28:46.041 --> 28:48.043
Is it be possible to ask her
a few questions?

28:48.243 --> 28:49.845
- When?
- As soon as possible.

28:50.045 --> 28:53.132
Our daughter's missing and Janet was
the last person to see her.

28:53.632 --> 28:55.518
I'm not comfortable with her
being interrogated.

28:55.718 --> 28:59.105
I'm just talking about asking her
one or two questions.

28:59.305 --> 29:01.307
I'll leave it up to her father.

29:06.228 --> 29:08.948
Let me go in first,
make sure she's up to it.

29:09.448 --> 29:10.699
Thank you.

29:24.296 --> 29:27.299
You know what we should do
when this is over?

29:27.499 --> 29:28.801
Get some sleep?

29:30.803 --> 29:33.105
We should take that trip
we always talked about.

29:33.305 --> 29:36.809
You know, up the coast into Canada.
Just the three of us.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.812
That sounds nice.

29:42.598 --> 29:45.100
I'm sorry, Nina's following up a lead.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.369
That was quick.

29:46.569 --> 29:50.072
Do what I tell you, Jack, and you
might see your daughter again.

29:50.272 --> 29:52.074
Say yes if you understand me.

29:53.576 --> 29:55.244
Answer me, Jack.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.464
Yes.

29:58.664 --> 30:01.167
Now smile at your wife
like nothing's wrong...

30:01.367 --> 30:03.419
...and move away from the doors.

30:12.711 --> 30:14.680
That's right, we're watching you.

30:19.351 --> 30:23.355
Walk away now, or Kimberly gets
a bullet in her head.

30:33.365 --> 30:36.785
The reception is really bad here.
I'll be right back.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.042
Now continue down the hall.

30:47.046 --> 30:49.548
Come on Jack, I don't have all day.

30:54.003 --> 30:56.096
What do you want me to do?

30:56.296 --> 30:58.390
Go out the north entrance.

31:06.432 --> 31:07.433
Left.

31:08.601 --> 31:11.103
Yes, I'm still watching you.

31:12.354 --> 31:14.857
Let's head out the north entrance.

31:19.328 --> 31:20.829
She's a tough one, your daughter.

31:21.330 --> 31:22.831
Tell me about it.

31:26.619 --> 31:29.171
Would you rather go in alone?

31:29.371 --> 31:30.289
Do you mind?

31:43.936 --> 31:44.937
Daddy?

31:46.722 --> 31:48.057
Hello, Janet.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.862
You've had a rough night, haven't you?

31:56.482 --> 31:57.983
Who are you?

32:02.204 --> 32:03.572
Where's my father?

33:52.681 --> 33:54.483
Where am I going?

33:54.683 --> 33:57.236
On your left, there's a silver Taurus.

33:59.688 --> 34:00.489
I see it.

34:01.356 --> 34:02.324
Get in.

34:14.085 --> 34:15.471
Open the glove compartment.

34:15.670 --> 34:18.873
First prove to me that my daughter
is still alive.

34:22.043 --> 34:22.678
Daddy?

34:22.878 --> 34:24.880
Kimberly? Are you okay?

34:25.380 --> 34:27.933
Yeah, they haven't hurt me, but I'm...

34:29.885 --> 34:33.856
There's a metal box inside the
glove compartment. Take it out.

34:44.149 --> 34:45.818
Tuck it in your ear.

34:52.206 --> 34:54.009
Now say something.

34:54.208 --> 34:56.712
If you hurt my daughter, I will kill you.

34:56.911 --> 35:00.382
Good. There's a nice, clear signal.

35:00.582 --> 35:03.585
You won't need your phone anymore.
Lose it out the window.

35:05.838 --> 35:07.339
Out the window, Jack.

35:18.400 --> 35:21.353
The keys are on the seat next to you.

35:26.241 --> 35:28.544
Where do you want me to go?

35:28.744 --> 35:31.246
You're going to the
office, like everyone else.

35:31.446 --> 35:33.499
- CTU?
- That's where you work.

36:04.029 --> 36:06.031
This is Jack Bauer. Leave a message.

36:06.231 --> 36:08.334
Jack, where are you?

36:08.534 --> 36:10.336
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

36:10.536 --> 36:12.905
- Where's Jack?
- He went to take a call

36:13.105 --> 36:13.706
I need to talk to him.

36:13.906 --> 36:15.958
Why, what did Janet say?
Does she know something?

36:16.458 --> 36:17.960
They were trying to escape.

36:18.160 --> 36:19.011
Escape from whom?

36:19.211 --> 36:21.213
A couple of boys who got too aggressive.

36:21.413 --> 36:22.939
She doesn't know if Kim got away.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.466
Kim would have called if she did.

36:24.666 --> 36:27.553
Janet says that they were being
held in a house up in Bel Air.

36:27.753 --> 36:28.721
That's the address?

36:28.921 --> 36:30.589
We should give it to the police.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.591
Jack is the police.

36:36.812 --> 36:38.063
Jack, pick up.

36:38.263 --> 36:39.565
This is Jack Bauer. Leave a message.

36:39.765 --> 36:41.934
He's not answering.
Jack, listen, it's me again.

36:42.434 --> 36:44.036
Janet may know where Kimberly is.

36:44.236 --> 36:47.489
Would you please call me as soon
as you get this, okay?

36:49.491 --> 36:50.492
Jack?

36:54.997 --> 36:57.232
He was just here. He promised
me he wouldn't leave.

36:57.432 --> 36:59.468
Keep trying him on his cell.
I'll call the police.

36:59.668 --> 37:02.371
- No, I have to get there.
- If you want, I'll take you.

37:02.571 --> 37:04.640
- Well, what about Janet?
- She's sleeping.

37:04.840 --> 37:09.094
Dr. Collier says she's not in any danger
and she'll be out for a couple of hours, Okay?

37:09.294 --> 37:10.095
Okay.

37:12.764 --> 37:15.267
I guess I'll just call from the car.

38:08.186 --> 38:09.738
Come on, move it.

38:33.178 --> 38:34.346
Sorry, man.

38:42.354 --> 38:45.140
- We're gonna be okay.
- Maybe.

38:47.142 --> 38:48.143
I just spoke to my dad.

38:48.343 --> 38:49.144
How?

38:49.644 --> 38:51.004
Gaines put me on the phone with him.

38:51.204 --> 38:52.564
What does Gaines want from your dad?

38:52.764 --> 38:53.866
- Money?
- No.

38:54.066 --> 38:57.569
I'm not sure, but I don't think
it's about money.

38:57.769 --> 38:59.087
My dad's gonna get us out.

38:59.287 --> 39:02.074
He doesn't even know where we are.

39:02.274 --> 39:03.575
It doesn't matter.

39:05.077 --> 39:06.745
He'll find us.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.233
What's up, Milo?

39:28.433 --> 39:31.436
Did you try using an S-box
inversion on that keycard?

39:31.636 --> 39:33.739
No. Why?

39:33.939 --> 39:38.443
I don't know, it's just the fastest way
into a file that size.

39:38.643 --> 39:40.946
Your hunch on the AMA database paid off.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.948
We just ID'd our John Doe.

40:14.613 --> 40:17.449
What happened to your wrist?
You didn't have that before.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.251
Yeah, I did.

40:19.451 --> 40:22.404
- It happened back at the furniture store.
- Oh.

40:23.538 --> 40:24.906
Maybe that's Jack.

40:25.106 --> 40:25.924
Jack?

40:26.124 --> 40:27.626
Teri. Hi, it's Nina Myers.

40:28.577 --> 40:30.178
Oh, hi, Nina.

40:30.378 --> 40:32.780
I have some important information for Jack.

40:32.980 --> 40:35.183
He's not answering and I know he's with you.

40:35.383 --> 40:38.386
No, he was, but he went to take a call
a couple minutes ago.

40:38.887 --> 40:40.472
I thought it was from you.

40:40.672 --> 40:43.675
No, I haven't spoken to him in
almost half an hour.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.343
Then you don't know where he is?

40:45.543 --> 40:46.311
No.

40:46.812 --> 40:49.114
Nina, what's going on?

40:49.314 --> 40:52.818
Um... listen Teri, if you hear from
him first, can you give him a message?

40:53.318 --> 40:55.120
Of course.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.823
There's a murder victim he asked me to ID.

40:58.023 --> 41:01.026
Tell him the murder victim's
name is Alan York.

41:04.329 --> 41:06.648
I'm sorry, Nina, could you say
that again please?

41:06.848 --> 41:08.967
Alan York. He's an accountant
from the Valley.

41:09.167 --> 41:12.587
Listen, I'll give Jack the details
when I speak to him.

41:14.089 --> 41:15.090
Hello?

41:16.591 --> 41:17.592
Yeah.

41:18.093 --> 41:20.095
- Will you tell Jack?
- Sure.

41:20.595 --> 41:23.598
Thanks, and if you hear from him,
tell him to call in?

41:23.798 --> 41:25.100
- Okay.
- Thanks.

41:29.137 --> 41:30.439
Everything all right?

41:30.639 --> 41:34.142
Yeah, that was just someone from Jack's
office trying to find him.
