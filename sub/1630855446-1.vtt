WEBVTT

01:16.209 --> 01:17.292
Thom.

01:18.792 --> 01:21.251
Papa used to say
not to be blinded

01:21.376 --> 01:22.709
by your own brilliance...

01:25.001 --> 01:26.251
because you are...

01:28.084 --> 01:30.501
more brilliant
than even you know,

01:32.042 --> 01:33.542
and also more dangerous.

01:35.876 --> 01:39.876
I want to show you how history
can be made and unmade.

01:43.126 --> 01:45.751
How you created
something miraculous.

02:00.209 --> 02:01.959
So, I've gathered together
our story

02:02.084 --> 02:05.459
from whatever scraps
of footage I could find,

02:07.834 --> 02:09.542
in the hope that somehow,

02:10.667 --> 02:14.709
some time,
this film will find you...

02:17.292 --> 02:18.584
and stop you.

02:25.667 --> 02:29.042
I'm going to show you
how to see your future.

03:01.876 --> 03:04.167
Radio waves never die.

03:05.501 --> 03:08.834
If we can receive broadcasts
from the past,

03:08.959 --> 03:12.209
surely we can receive them
from the future?

03:24.084 --> 03:25.042
I'll never
forget that day

03:25.167 --> 03:27.376
we switched her on
for the first time.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.376
1st October, 1938.

03:35.751 --> 03:38.376
We named her
in honour of Mama.

03:40.084 --> 03:41.251
LOLA.

03:54.459 --> 03:57.001
Ground control to Major Tom

03:57.126 --> 03:58.417
It works.

04:01.667 --> 04:02.959
Ground control to Major Tom

04:03.084 --> 04:04.626
We've seen the future.

04:08.834 --> 04:11.042
Take your protein pills

04:11.167 --> 04:14.167
And put your helmet on

04:14.834 --> 04:19.126
This is Ground Control
To Major Tom

04:19.834 --> 04:22.959
LOLA opened
a magical new world.

04:23.084 --> 04:25.584
1938 went into 1939,

04:26.167 --> 04:28.376
but those dates
meant nothing to us.

04:28.501 --> 04:30.001
We were living
in another time.

04:30.792 --> 04:34.042
And we finally had
a reliable source of income.

04:35.459 --> 04:37.167
Remember that car
I bought you?

04:37.626 --> 04:39.584
Way too small for those legs.

04:39.709 --> 04:42.667
Ground Control to Major Tom

04:42.792 --> 04:46.292
Your circuit's dead
There's something wrong

04:46.417 --> 04:49.334
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

04:49.459 --> 04:52.751
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

04:53.209 --> 04:56.167
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

04:56.626 --> 04:57.584
Can you hear...

04:57.709 --> 05:00.709
But LOLA didn't just
show us the world's wonders,

05:00.834 --> 05:03.251
she also showed us
its horrors.

05:03.376 --> 05:05.459
The Nazis had torn
through Europe,

05:05.584 --> 05:08.167
Paris had fallen,
Dunkirk had been evacuated,

05:08.292 --> 05:10.959
and now Hitler had set
his sights on Britain.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.626
The Blitz would claim
thousands of lives

05:13.751 --> 05:15.459
over the coming months.

05:15.584 --> 05:18.167
LOLA could no longer
be just ours.

05:21.584 --> 05:23.334
The world needed her.

05:26.667 --> 05:28.042
They burst out of the clouds

05:28.167 --> 05:29.459
at less than 2,000 feet

05:29.584 --> 05:32.001
and dropped their deadly cargo
on the Isle of Dogs before...

05:44.376 --> 05:46.667
This is an urgent warning,

05:46.792 --> 05:49.917
1:35 a.m. Hackney
and 1:45 Islington.

05:50.042 --> 05:51.667
Due to thick cloud,
there will be no warning

05:51.792 --> 05:54.084
from the authorities
for any of these attacks.

05:54.209 --> 05:55.751
Please make yourselves safe.

06:04.709 --> 06:06.126
3rd May, 1941,

06:06.251 --> 06:08.292
21st furrow
for the Angel of Portobello.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.959
It has become
a nightly occurrence.

06:18.084 --> 06:20.751
After sundown, German bombers
cross the Channel

06:20.876 --> 06:21.917
with their deadly cargo.

06:22.542 --> 06:24.667
No one knows where
they will target or when.

06:26.334 --> 06:29.251
No one, that is,
but their German commanders

06:29.376 --> 06:31.167
and one mystery woman
in England,

06:31.292 --> 06:33.501
nicknamed
the Angel of Portobello

06:33.626 --> 06:35.042
by those residents
of West London

06:35.167 --> 06:37.626
whose lives have been
among the first saved

06:37.751 --> 06:39.167
by her warnings.

06:44.667 --> 06:46.876
Warning, 1:35 a.m. Hackney

06:47.001 --> 06:49.584
and 1:45 Islington, repeat,

06:49.709 --> 06:52.501
1:35 a.m. Hackney
and 1:45 Islington.

06:52.626 --> 06:54.459
Due to thick cloud,
there will be no warning

06:54.584 --> 06:56.376
from the authorities
for any of these attacks.

06:56.501 --> 06:58.251
Please make yourselves safe.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.417
While the warnings
didn't stop the bombings,

07:00.542 --> 07:02.501
they did once again
save dozens of lives.

07:02.626 --> 07:05.167
Last night,
at about half past 12,

07:05.292 --> 07:06.751
we heard
the Angel of Portobello.

07:06.876 --> 07:09.334
We were in a dugout
and, er, thanks to the...

07:09.459 --> 07:10.584
thanks to
the Angel of Portobello,

07:10.709 --> 07:11.667
we are quite safe.

07:11.792 --> 07:13.709
Thanks to
the Angel of Portobello,

07:13.834 --> 07:18.417
my family is all right,
but our house got clobbered.

07:27.792 --> 07:30.667
Oh, God.
No, Thom, not this one.

07:30.792 --> 07:34.334
She has nothing to say
about life or freedom.

07:35.792 --> 07:37.334
Well, we can't get it anyway.

07:37.459 --> 07:39.417
But you are wrong, Mars,

07:39.542 --> 07:41.376
the sentiment
is tediously accurate.

07:41.501 --> 07:43.876
People would rather buy
into fatalism

07:44.001 --> 07:46.167
- than own their own destiny.
- Hmm.

07:46.292 --> 07:47.251
Don't people just want to know

07:47.376 --> 07:48.834
that everything
is going to be all right?

07:48.959 --> 07:51.292
Come dance with me, Mars.

07:51.417 --> 07:53.084
I'm not dancing to this.

07:53.209 --> 07:55.917
I really miss you, honey

07:56.042 --> 07:59.959
When, when...

08:00.084 --> 08:01.084
Here.

08:12.751 --> 08:14.334
Preparation
of food supplements.

08:18.209 --> 08:19.334
Perplexed officials say

08:19.459 --> 08:22.292
that the source of the Angel's
signal remains a mystery,

08:22.417 --> 08:24.542
and the army has been
unable to identify

08:24.667 --> 08:26.501
the mysterious
lady broadcaster.

08:27.001 --> 08:28.542
- Normally, we locate...
- Oh!

08:28.667 --> 08:31.459
...a pirate radio within
15 minutes of broadcasting.

08:32.042 --> 08:33.751
You get a signal search

08:33.876 --> 08:35.834
when pointing in the direction
of the source.

08:36.751 --> 08:39.209
Whereas here, the signal
is coming from all around us.

08:39.334 --> 08:42.334
It's like we're sitting
on top of the antenna.

08:42.459 --> 08:43.417
It's extraordinary.

08:43.542 --> 08:44.834
We'd like the people
behind this

08:44.959 --> 08:47.167
to stop their game now
and come forward.

08:47.292 --> 08:48.584
We are at war.

08:48.709 --> 08:50.792
Our intrepid
officers continue their search

08:50.917 --> 08:53.709
for the Angel of Portobello,
documenting as they go.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.501
Well, they're never
gonna catch us, anyway.

08:56.334 --> 08:58.292
No, of course not.
You're much too clever.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.042
Log of Lieutenant
Sebastian Holloway,

09:04.167 --> 09:06.001
1st June, '41.

09:06.667 --> 09:09.876
I finally traced the signal
source to Shoreham Gasworks.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.501
The Angel of Portobello
is using the gasometer

09:12.626 --> 09:14.251
as a natural transmitter.

09:15.084 --> 09:16.667
The metal superstructure
magnifies

09:16.792 --> 09:19.209
her weak radio signal
and sends it through the mains

09:19.334 --> 09:20.959
into London's pipe networks

09:21.084 --> 09:23.917
which acts as her very own
personal antenna.

09:24.042 --> 09:27.209
It explains why her broadcasts
are omnidirectional in London.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.751
They were coming
from the entire gas grid,

09:29.876 --> 09:30.834
very clever.

09:30.959 --> 09:34.126
2:15, spot what I assume
to be the Angel of Portobello.

09:34.251 --> 09:37.126
Young woman,
curly blonde hair, on bicycle.

09:37.876 --> 09:40.209
2:25, she climbs
the main gasometer.

09:41.167 --> 09:43.709
She spends about 15 minutes
making adjustments

09:43.834 --> 09:46.417
to what turns out to be
a battery-operated transmitter

09:46.542 --> 09:47.876
and the signal source.

09:49.626 --> 09:51.626
2:45, she spots me

09:51.751 --> 09:55.084
and Lance Corporal Clark,
who's filming. She flees.

09:56.084 --> 09:58.292
Cycles west toward the coast.

09:59.167 --> 10:01.459
Very few houses
on this stretch of land.

10:01.584 --> 10:02.751
Terrible roads.

10:03.334 --> 10:04.334
She nearly escapes,

10:04.459 --> 10:06.167
but even she finds
the conditions difficult,

10:06.292 --> 10:07.751
and we manage to cut her off.

10:10.917 --> 10:12.417
She denies everything,
of course.

10:14.042 --> 10:16.626
Says she uses the gasometer
for bird watching.

10:17.959 --> 10:19.501
Is extremely rude.

10:21.209 --> 10:22.334
Has no papers.

10:22.459 --> 10:26.209
But does possess radio
transmitting equipment,

10:27.959 --> 10:32.334
plus a map of all
the gasometers in England.

10:38.959 --> 10:40.709
When I ask her
to identify herself,

10:40.834 --> 10:43.126
she makes up some
obviously bogus names.

10:43.251 --> 10:46.251
Eartha Kitt, Maria von Trapp,
Lady Stardust.

10:46.376 --> 10:48.251
Actual name, Martha Hanbury.

10:49.376 --> 10:52.167
After some gentle persuasion,
she finally acquiesces

10:52.292 --> 10:54.667
and agrees to escort us
to her house.

10:55.626 --> 10:57.834
Strange old place,
quite run-down.

10:58.584 --> 11:02.001
Her sister, Thomasina Hanbury,
emerges and is even ruder.

11:02.126 --> 11:04.376
Threatens to do damage
to my privates,

11:04.501 --> 11:06.292
but relents when I suggest

11:06.417 --> 11:07.917
returning with
a search warrant.

11:08.792 --> 11:11.251
3:15 p.m., I get my first look
at their machine

11:11.376 --> 11:12.834
which they call LOLA.

11:14.417 --> 11:15.667
It's going to change history.

11:25.792 --> 11:26.876
Come on, then.
You've got 10 minutes,

11:27.001 --> 11:28.001
in and out.

11:33.667 --> 11:36.542
This is... magnificent.
It's beautiful.

11:38.251 --> 11:39.501
How do you...
How does it work?

11:41.001 --> 11:43.417
Why aren't you doing more
to stop people from dying?

11:43.542 --> 11:45.126
Better you tell us
how you predict the future.

11:45.251 --> 11:46.209
We know you do.

11:46.334 --> 11:48.251
Mars, what in God's earth
did you say to him?

11:48.376 --> 11:50.459
That you can catch radio
and television broadcasts

11:50.584 --> 11:51.542
from the future.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.542
I had to tell him. He said
we could be hanged as spies...

11:53.667 --> 11:55.084
Don't touch it!

11:57.959 --> 11:59.376
How did you find us?

11:59.501 --> 12:00.667
I was just lucky.

12:01.459 --> 12:03.667
I couldn't understand how
the signal was so dispersed.

12:03.792 --> 12:06.917
But I noticed it was stronger
in houses with piped gas.

12:07.042 --> 12:08.542
Using the copper piped
gas network

12:08.667 --> 12:10.084
as an antenna, that's genius.

12:11.376 --> 12:12.584
I want to help.

12:18.959 --> 12:20.959
You weren't
so easily convinced.

12:37.501 --> 12:38.751
All right, darling?

12:45.001 --> 12:46.709
Do you have to film us
in the bath?

12:47.167 --> 12:48.167
Wash your face.

12:48.292 --> 12:49.251
You look a mess.

12:49.376 --> 12:51.334
I hate anyone coming here.

12:51.459 --> 12:52.917
He's pushy and cocky

12:53.042 --> 12:55.001
and there are negative
consequences to those defects.

12:55.126 --> 12:57.042
Well, he could have
had us arrested.

12:57.167 --> 12:59.626
I don't think he wants
to lord it over us.

13:01.459 --> 13:03.417
- Give me the camera.
- Mm.

13:03.959 --> 13:04.959
Give me the camera.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.334
Here's my prognosis.

13:14.459 --> 13:17.626
You, in all probability,
are going to make him

13:17.751 --> 13:18.834
fall in love with you

13:18.959 --> 13:20.084
and then you'll leave with him

13:20.209 --> 13:21.917
and create jolly offspring.

13:22.042 --> 13:24.584
But who's to say
I would love him back?

13:24.709 --> 13:26.584
No, if he falls
under my spell,

13:26.709 --> 13:28.376
then we can make him
do exactly what we want.

13:28.501 --> 13:30.709
We can make him
muck out Scarborough.

13:30.834 --> 13:32.834
True.
Don't be too charming,

13:32.959 --> 13:34.334
I don't think you know
when to stop.

13:34.459 --> 13:35.959
He might like you more.

13:36.084 --> 13:37.209
Oh, my clitoris
and I do not

13:37.334 --> 13:38.959
need extra company.

13:41.167 --> 13:44.584
Well, good morning.
This is Major Cobcroft.

13:44.709 --> 13:46.626
He has authorised
my presence here.

13:47.417 --> 13:48.584
Where do you want us?

13:50.501 --> 13:52.751
I have realised you were
at Cheltenham last year.

13:53.584 --> 13:55.376
Twenty-three wins in a row.

14:01.126 --> 14:02.126
Hello.

14:05.042 --> 14:07.042
Is someone gonna say hello?

14:08.417 --> 14:09.417
Hello.

14:12.209 --> 14:13.584
Holloway, is this a joke?

14:14.667 --> 14:16.959
Er, Major Cobcroft has kindly
provided you

14:17.084 --> 14:18.626
with some special provisions.

14:18.751 --> 14:21.584
There's tea and coffee,
ham and cheese,

14:21.709 --> 14:24.084
fancy canned content.

14:24.209 --> 14:25.542
Friends in high places.

14:26.084 --> 14:27.834
You are most kind.

14:27.959 --> 14:30.084
But my sister will tell you,
for me eating is merely

14:30.209 --> 14:32.709
a distraction, and if you
imagine we would cook for you,

14:32.834 --> 14:34.042
we are not your women.

14:35.751 --> 14:37.084
I think we need
to re-establish

14:37.209 --> 14:38.667
who's in charge here.

14:45.626 --> 14:47.001
As the
troops went into Smithfield,

14:47.126 --> 14:48.292
- the porter...
- They've just been

14:48.417 --> 14:50.084
working off material
like this.

14:50.792 --> 14:52.292
Future news bulletins.

14:54.167 --> 14:55.292
Can you imagine what
they could achieve

14:55.417 --> 14:57.584
using intel
from military radio?

14:57.709 --> 14:59.792
And if they coordinated
the information with us.

15:01.292 --> 15:02.292
No.

15:09.959 --> 15:11.751
What
happens when the human body

15:11.876 --> 15:13.167
is rocketed into space?

15:13.292 --> 15:15.834
A foretaste of the fantastic
ordeal which awaits

15:15.959 --> 15:17.751
the first man to the Moon.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.584
It reminds me
of going home on a bus.

15:19.709 --> 15:21.459
Christ.

15:29.126 --> 15:31.834
Who on earth are
those diabolical creatures?

15:31.959 --> 15:32.959
Show's over.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.167
They're con artists.

15:36.292 --> 15:37.876
They're projecting B movies
onto that screen.

15:38.001 --> 15:39.251
How do you explain
their predictions?

15:39.376 --> 15:40.376
They got lucky.

15:40.501 --> 15:42.001
Just give me
one go, sir.

15:42.126 --> 15:44.626
Let them tune into military
radio under my supervision.

15:44.751 --> 15:45.917
This is
highly irregular.

15:46.042 --> 15:47.167
I bet a magnum
of champagne

15:47.292 --> 15:49.042
we can make a correct
prediction with that machine.

15:51.709 --> 15:52.709
All right.

15:53.584 --> 15:55.126
But we keep this between us.

15:55.251 --> 15:58.084
It backfires, I know nothing,
you understand?

15:58.209 --> 15:59.626
Yes, of course.

16:03.251 --> 16:04.209
Why are you filming me?

16:04.334 --> 16:05.876
You,
I'm keeping an eye on.

16:06.001 --> 16:07.626
God, you don't miss anything,
do you?

16:14.417 --> 16:16.292
Is that thing recording
sound too?

16:18.001 --> 16:19.626
How does it do that?
It's titchy.

16:20.667 --> 16:23.042
Everything goes
onto the same piece of film.

16:23.167 --> 16:24.834
I use the space
between the sprocket holes

16:24.959 --> 16:25.959
for the soundwave.

16:27.709 --> 16:28.959
You invented this.

16:29.084 --> 16:30.376
Thom made it for me.

16:31.626 --> 16:32.876
She should patent it.

16:33.917 --> 16:35.334
Oh, no, no, no, no!

16:35.459 --> 16:37.626
No, that's my dark room.
Out. Shut the door.

16:37.751 --> 16:40.167
-Shut the door.
-Where's your refrigerator?

16:40.292 --> 16:42.042
We have a pantry.

16:43.126 --> 16:46.334
Erm... It's pretty draughty,
so it's chilly in there.

16:46.459 --> 16:47.417
Well, that's good.

16:47.542 --> 16:50.292
And very in keeping
with the war effort.

16:55.126 --> 16:57.667
So, Sebastian,
are you handy in the kitchen?

17:07.792 --> 17:09.292
Here are the rules
of the game.

17:10.001 --> 17:13.292
Each morning, I use LOLA
to tune into tomorrow's report

17:13.417 --> 17:15.792
from the Royal
Signaller's Station.

17:15.917 --> 17:18.001
That way, we will have
advanced knowledge

17:18.126 --> 17:20.042
of all enemy attacks.

17:20.167 --> 17:22.501
Sebastian's job
is to cross-check

17:22.626 --> 17:26.292
the sign-off codes, so we know
the radio report is authentic.

17:26.417 --> 17:28.584
He sends the intelligence
to Cobcroft,

17:28.709 --> 17:31.334
who puts the information
into action.

17:31.459 --> 17:34.376
Mars continues to document
this for prosperity.

17:34.501 --> 17:37.167
And Sebastian needs to
stock us up with better food,

17:37.292 --> 17:39.459
more wine
and a pile more cigarettes.

17:42.626 --> 17:46.042
Operation Chrono,
11th August, 1941.

17:49.792 --> 17:52.876
8:00 a.m. at 323 Hertz.

17:54.251 --> 17:56.042
It was vital
that we find

17:56.167 --> 17:57.959
the right piece of intel.

17:58.084 --> 17:59.667
Anything too big would risk

17:59.792 --> 18:01.417
giving the game away.

18:01.542 --> 18:02.792
But something too small

18:02.917 --> 18:05.042
might not be enough
to impress Cobcroft.

18:06.209 --> 18:08.751
We listened
to dozens of reports.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.709
Problems impossible to fix.

18:13.251 --> 18:15.292
We weren't finding
what we needed.

18:16.542 --> 18:18.084
And let's not forget

18:18.209 --> 18:20.459
that you hated
working in a team.

18:24.584 --> 18:27.042
It looked as though
our trial was a failure.

18:28.917 --> 18:30.084
And then...

18:30.834 --> 18:33.501
Morning report, August 12th.

18:33.626 --> 18:36.042
Richmond RAF base destroyed.

18:36.167 --> 18:39.084
Enemy attacked
from south-easterly bearing.

18:39.209 --> 18:42.001
Cairo, Alpha, Foxtrot,
9, Bravo. Over.

18:42.126 --> 18:43.167
Okay, that's the one.

18:43.917 --> 18:45.751
Sebastian, check the code.

18:48.709 --> 18:50.542
That's the correct
sign-off code, sir.

18:52.001 --> 18:53.584
Very well.

18:53.709 --> 18:55.876
I'll warn Richmond
anti-air defence.

18:59.209 --> 19:00.542
We could end the war
with this machine.

19:00.667 --> 19:01.709
Ever thought of that?

19:01.834 --> 19:03.834
You are
a prick. Of course I have.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.584
See how you get on
with that intel.

19:06.917 --> 19:07.917
Sorry.

19:09.001 --> 19:10.876
The enemy can't think
we know everything it's doing.

19:11.001 --> 19:12.292
Papa said
to never underestimate

19:12.417 --> 19:13.626
the cunning of the desperate.

19:13.751 --> 19:15.376
He actually said
to never underestimate

19:15.501 --> 19:17.292
the violence
of the power hungry.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.626
And also, actually, we didn't
have military intelligence.

19:19.751 --> 19:21.459
Well, also, actually
Papa was anti-war

19:21.584 --> 19:23.001
and not only against
taking lives but...

19:23.126 --> 19:24.126
So am I.

19:26.501 --> 19:28.334
For all I know,
you could be a spy

19:28.459 --> 19:30.917
with access
to British military secrets.

19:31.042 --> 19:32.126
Now, Mars says
I should trust you,

19:32.251 --> 19:34.126
so don't fuck it up
by acting cocky.

19:36.792 --> 19:37.792
I'm hungry.

19:42.334 --> 19:43.876
He's invading
my creative space.

19:44.001 --> 19:45.417
I wish he'd invade mine.

19:45.542 --> 19:47.167
You are such a tarting flirt.

19:47.292 --> 19:49.459
A flirting
tart, don't you mean?

19:52.667 --> 19:54.126
Er... Oh.

19:56.834 --> 19:57.834
Oh.

20:02.167 --> 20:03.292
Well, I think
he's the best thing

20:03.417 --> 20:04.876
that's happened to us
since we won enough money

20:05.001 --> 20:05.959
to feed ourselves.

20:06.084 --> 20:07.459
Well,
I will make it happen

20:07.584 --> 20:08.917
and he will sit there
and watch,

20:09.042 --> 20:11.001
and if he gloats,
I will punch him.

20:15.959 --> 20:18.292
All that was left
for us to do was wait

20:18.417 --> 20:20.751
until the morning to see
if our plan had worked.

20:24.917 --> 20:27.001
That night, we waited...

20:28.626 --> 20:30.501
...and waited...

20:32.334 --> 20:33.667
and waited.

20:37.584 --> 20:38.584
Until...

20:39.876 --> 20:41.167
Last night,
the military scored

20:41.292 --> 20:44.001
a major victory against
the Luftwaffe by shooting down

20:44.126 --> 20:45.751
an entire German
bomber squadron

20:45.876 --> 20:47.501
over a Richmond RAF base.

20:47.626 --> 20:49.459
This is a great victory for...

20:52.334 --> 20:55.334
Oh, God. God, I'm good.

21:08.667 --> 21:09.751
Success.

21:10.251 --> 21:12.001
Our intel had painted
a bull's-eye

21:12.126 --> 21:14.626
over every German bomber
that night.

21:18.667 --> 21:21.042
The anti-aircraft gunners
took care of the rest.

21:21.917 --> 21:24.251
Our plan had worked.

21:29.084 --> 21:30.792
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, hold them up.

21:30.917 --> 21:31.959
Hold them up, let me see them.

21:32.084 --> 21:35.459
Oh, you bake.
How cool.

21:35.584 --> 21:37.292
Yeah, I'm afraid the oven
wasn't very hot.

21:37.417 --> 21:39.209
No, I mean cool
as in groovy.

21:39.334 --> 21:41.584
Groovy?
Is that an adjective?

21:43.792 --> 21:44.751
Major.

21:44.876 --> 21:47.042
Bloody hell,
Holloway. Outstanding.

21:47.167 --> 21:49.417
We should make Miss Hanbury
an Honorary Major.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.751
Open your dispatch bag,
the ladies earned it, not you.

21:52.876 --> 21:53.876
Thank you, sir.

21:54.626 --> 21:56.792
- Major Thom.
- Very funny.

21:56.917 --> 21:59.084
Oh, very nice.

21:59.209 --> 22:03.126
Oh! Thank you. I think
he said for the ladies.

22:03.251 --> 22:06.709
Unless you'd like
to join us for a drink.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.084
You were brilliant.

22:25.167 --> 22:27.917
You changed the course
of the war.

22:28.042 --> 22:30.417
Cities that would have
been bombed were saved.

22:31.126 --> 22:33.126
People who wouldn't
have been alive

22:33.251 --> 22:35.292
were walking the streets.

22:59.834 --> 23:01.959
We may allow ourselves

23:02.084 --> 23:04.917
a brief period of rejoicing.

23:06.376 --> 23:08.334
Advance, Britannia.

23:08.459 --> 23:11.042
Long live
the cause of freedom.

23:52.251 --> 23:55.084
Sebastian was
in awe of LOLA

23:56.417 --> 23:59.626
and, it seemed,
a little in love with me.

24:07.584 --> 24:09.792
Stop filming me, I'm peeing!

24:09.917 --> 24:11.709
Girls don't pee
standing up.

24:12.751 --> 24:15.251
No, Mama always
peed like this.

24:15.917 --> 24:18.167
She said it's much healthier
to get the urine

24:18.292 --> 24:21.501
as far away from one's vagina
as possible.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.459
- How interesting.
- Hmm.

24:23.584 --> 24:25.417
My mother
made me pee sitting down

24:25.542 --> 24:27.876
to avoid the seat
up/down conundrum.

24:28.001 --> 24:29.876
I think it's really because
she wanted another girl.

24:30.001 --> 24:31.876
Well,

24:32.001 --> 24:34.709
gender divide
is an artificial construct.

24:34.834 --> 24:37.292
You know, that was
a Papa saying.

24:41.209 --> 24:42.876
I said, stop filming!

24:50.001 --> 24:51.792
Why do you
film everything?

24:51.917 --> 24:53.459
Well, because we're alone.

24:53.584 --> 24:55.126
And why
are you alone?

24:55.834 --> 24:57.084
Mm...

24:58.334 --> 25:00.209
Oh, Papa was conscripted.

25:01.042 --> 25:03.084
He lasted two weeks.

25:05.417 --> 25:08.001
He lasted two weeks
at the front and...

25:08.709 --> 25:12.167
"Fighting for peace is like
screwing for virginity."

25:12.959 --> 25:15.834
Or that's what he would have
said if he had lived longer.

25:15.959 --> 25:17.584
Gosh. Right.

25:18.792 --> 25:21.167
-So who did...
-Hmm?

25:22.167 --> 25:24.251
Oh, I can't remember.

25:24.376 --> 25:27.751
Some dude from the 1960s.

25:28.959 --> 25:30.292
Oh, it's quite disconcerting

25:30.417 --> 25:33.042
that for you two, history goes
forwards as well as backwards.

25:33.626 --> 25:34.917
Mm.

25:36.042 --> 25:41.917
Now, Mama said Papa was killed
at the altar of war worship.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.584
She fired all the help,

25:45.709 --> 25:47.376
she stopped sending us
to school

25:47.501 --> 25:49.251
and she...

25:49.376 --> 25:51.709
went to her room
and listened to records.

25:52.917 --> 25:55.001
And then she started going
for very long walks.

25:55.126 --> 25:56.834
And then one day,
they found her

25:57.792 --> 26:00.001
stuck between two rocks,
halfway down a crag

26:00.126 --> 26:03.376
that plummets
into the nearby cove.

26:06.376 --> 26:08.876
Saving people
for the ones we lost.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.292
I was enjoying
my new-found company

26:28.417 --> 26:30.584
while you were busy
defending the country.

26:35.417 --> 26:38.459
Not that you were getting
the credit, of course.

27:19.251 --> 27:22.417
It's an honour to have been
made a Knight Commander

27:22.542 --> 27:23.959
of the Order of the Bath.

27:25.126 --> 27:26.667
I am proud
of the work I've done

27:26.792 --> 27:29.626
in turning the tide of war
against Adolf Hitler.

27:32.459 --> 27:35.751
But this evening isn't
all about my achievements,

27:36.667 --> 27:37.792
it's about you,

27:39.126 --> 27:42.459
my fellow officers
of the Intelligence Corps,

27:42.876 --> 27:45.417
who've helped me
to put an end to the Blitz.

27:46.542 --> 27:48.167
This is only
just the beginning.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.584
By God, we are good.

28:36.209 --> 28:37.667
This is one of our favourites,

28:37.792 --> 28:39.126
you won't be hearing it again
for some time.

28:43.917 --> 28:45.292
Thom, that's, erm...

28:52.709 --> 28:55.626
Girl
You really got me goin'

28:55.751 --> 28:58.834
You got me now I don't know
What I'm doin' now

28:58.959 --> 29:02.584
Yeah, you really got me now

29:02.709 --> 29:05.417
You got me
So I can't sleep at night

29:06.709 --> 29:09.542
Yeah, you really got me now

29:09.667 --> 29:12.959
You got me so I don't know
What I'm doin' now

29:13.084 --> 29:16.501
Oh, yeah
You really got me now

29:16.626 --> 29:18.709
You got me
So I can't sleep at night

29:18.834 --> 29:22.042
You really got me
You really got me

29:22.167 --> 29:23.334
You really got me

29:27.709 --> 29:30.417
See, don't ever set me free

29:30.542 --> 29:32.876
I always wanna be by your side

29:34.792 --> 29:37.501
Girl, you really got me now

29:37.626 --> 29:40.001
You've got me
So I can't sleep at night

29:41.751 --> 29:44.542
Yeah, you really got me now

29:44.667 --> 29:48.001
You've got me so I don't know
What I'm doin' now

29:48.126 --> 29:51.501
Oh, yeah
You really got me now

29:51.626 --> 29:53.626
You got me
So I can't sleep at night

29:53.751 --> 29:57.042
You really got me
You really got me

29:57.167 --> 29:58.709
You really got me

29:58.834 --> 30:02.709
Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!

31:19.001 --> 31:20.001
No!

31:20.917 --> 31:22.292
My camera.

31:22.959 --> 31:25.042
So, LOLA is so much more
than a war fighter.

31:25.792 --> 31:27.126
This is the true magic.

31:29.584 --> 31:30.584
Erm...

31:31.584 --> 31:34.251
Movies, documentaries.

31:34.376 --> 31:37.251
Newsreels.
Play-outs from LOLA.

31:47.584 --> 31:49.459
Oh, my God.

31:57.584 --> 31:59.167
Is this our future?

31:59.292 --> 32:01.376
Well, this is the future
I'm interested in.

32:02.834 --> 32:05.751
Mama always said that art was
the weathervane of the soul.

32:06.709 --> 32:08.459
Now, see that wall over here?

32:08.584 --> 32:11.209
There, or over there.

32:11.334 --> 32:12.834
That wall is our past.

32:13.751 --> 32:15.876
She captured
every waking moment

32:16.001 --> 32:17.376
with such attention to detail.

32:18.042 --> 32:19.542
Oh, is that you?

32:19.667 --> 32:21.834
Maybe, yeah.

32:22.376 --> 32:23.376
No, I want to look.

32:23.501 --> 32:26.126
No, our children
are going to love this.

32:26.251 --> 32:27.709
At last, a musical rebellion

32:27.834 --> 32:29.876
against the stuffed shirts
that run the world.

32:30.001 --> 32:31.667
Our children?

32:37.417 --> 32:39.667
And who is this chap?

32:39.792 --> 32:42.334
Bob Dylan.

32:42.459 --> 32:44.959
He's one
of my all-time favourites.

32:45.084 --> 32:49.251
He speaks of freedom
and heartbreak,

32:49.376 --> 32:51.251
of a nation lost,

32:52.209 --> 32:54.667
and of the joy and pain
of the authentic soul.

32:56.834 --> 32:58.042
Like you.

33:01.751 --> 33:02.959
Come here.

33:11.792 --> 33:13.376
- Come on.
- What?

33:14.042 --> 33:15.459
Not a word to Thom.

33:15.584 --> 33:16.917
-Promise?
-Promise.

33:17.042 --> 33:19.001
Right, go over there
to that panel back there,

33:19.126 --> 33:20.501
over there to the left.

33:20.626 --> 33:23.084
See the switches
in the middle row?

33:23.209 --> 33:24.917
- Yeah.
- Third one in. Flick it.

33:25.542 --> 33:26.501
Yes!

33:26.626 --> 33:28.417
Now over to the other side.

33:28.542 --> 33:29.501
Other side, quickly.

33:29.626 --> 33:31.542
And the three silver ones.

33:31.667 --> 33:32.959
-Flick them up.
-Yeah.

33:33.667 --> 33:35.459
One, two, three. Yes.

33:35.584 --> 33:36.542
We're going to need
a power surge

33:36.667 --> 33:37.917
where we're going.

33:38.042 --> 33:39.876
Oh, that's far out.

33:40.001 --> 33:41.126
Far out of where?

33:41.251 --> 33:43.626
Now, tune it
to 133 kilohertz.

33:47.542 --> 33:48.834
9:03 p.m.,

33:50.626 --> 33:51.917
8th March,

33:54.834 --> 33:57.501
1973.

33:58.167 --> 34:00.584
Christ, this thing can see
30 years into the future.

34:00.709 --> 34:02.959
Not just major
broadcasts, royal weddings,

34:03.084 --> 34:04.417
signals beamed
around the world.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.209
The diamonds, though,
are the hit songs.

34:06.334 --> 34:07.542
The sound of marching feet

34:07.667 --> 34:09.251
In the street below

34:10.459 --> 34:11.584
No,
you've the wrong time.

34:12.792 --> 34:15.084
You... You said 9:03,
8th March...

34:15.209 --> 34:16.501
1973.

34:16.626 --> 34:17.792
Let me see.

34:20.917 --> 34:23.626
Polish up your jackboots

34:24.292 --> 34:27.001
Learn to march in time

34:27.626 --> 34:29.001
And fall into line

34:29.126 --> 34:30.417
The sound of marching feet

34:33.292 --> 34:35.292
And cracking the chart barrier

34:35.417 --> 34:37.126
at number one
for the 10th week running,

34:37.251 --> 34:40.334
Reginald Watson's
The Sound of Marching Feet.

34:40.459 --> 34:43.334
It looks like Watson
will be making musical history

34:43.459 --> 34:45.667
as his new hit,
Meet Me at the Gallows,

34:45.792 --> 34:47.542
has just crashed number two.

34:49.292 --> 34:51.376
I don't understand.

34:52.334 --> 34:55.001
Thom! Thom!

34:57.334 --> 34:58.334
What are you doing?

34:59.751 --> 35:01.001
He's not there.

35:01.459 --> 35:02.501
Who?

35:02.626 --> 35:03.751
David Bowie.

35:03.876 --> 35:05.001
Who's David Bowie?

35:05.126 --> 35:07.709
He's gone. Bowie's gone.

35:08.917 --> 35:10.459
Thirty years
is a long time away,

35:10.584 --> 35:11.626
the adjustment of variables

35:11.751 --> 35:13.667
could lead to a new set
of consequences.

35:14.334 --> 35:16.417
But we've tuned into him
hundreds of times,

35:16.542 --> 35:17.626
why is it suddenly changed?

35:17.751 --> 35:18.751
Mars,

35:18.876 --> 35:21.709
thanks to us, a lot of people
are alive who would be dead.

35:21.834 --> 35:23.751
It also means
we might have erased him.

35:25.126 --> 35:28.209
No,
you can't kill David Bowie.

35:28.334 --> 35:30.126
Maybe he lives but will have
a different childhood

35:30.251 --> 35:31.459
and become a dentist.

35:32.959 --> 35:34.584
That is a very severe
negative consequence.

35:34.709 --> 35:37.917
Mars, negativity is not
emotionally quantifiable.

35:38.042 --> 35:40.292
There will be someone else
as extraordinary as Bowie.

35:40.417 --> 35:42.584
No, there's
Reginald fucking Watson!

35:43.792 --> 35:46.876
We are trying
to end the war.

35:50.459 --> 35:52.084
You knew this could happen?

35:58.209 --> 36:01.459
I'm not sure it's moral
to erase lives.

36:01.584 --> 36:03.792
What happens to people
whose worlds we erased?

36:03.917 --> 36:05.209
Or is it moral to save lives?

36:05.334 --> 36:07.209
I mean, hypothetically you can
make love with someone

36:07.334 --> 36:08.751
and create life,
by choosing not to do that,

36:08.876 --> 36:09.834
are you erasing
potential life?

36:09.959 --> 36:12.084
Fix this Watson car crash
and get Bowie back!

36:14.709 --> 36:17.584
Sometimes you have
to make sacrifices

36:17.709 --> 36:18.959
for the greater good.

36:33.251 --> 36:35.834
We'd erased
all my heroes.

36:35.959 --> 36:40.334
Bob Dylan. Nina Simone.
David Bowie. Stanley Kubrick.

36:41.792 --> 36:45.167
Now, they were but memories
on my Moviola.

36:47.417 --> 36:50.292
LOLA was profoundly changing
the course of the war.

36:50.417 --> 36:51.917
But we had no way
of predicting

36:52.042 --> 36:53.917
how we were meddling
with the future.

36:57.251 --> 36:59.084
What else had we sacrificed?

37:01.876 --> 37:03.459
Morning, Miss Hanbury.

37:03.584 --> 37:05.626
We've updated
the signature codes.

37:05.751 --> 37:07.292
They'll be
in Holloway's dispatch bag.

37:07.417 --> 37:08.709
Why haven't you managed to hit

37:08.834 --> 37:10.084
any of the U-boat fleet?

37:10.209 --> 37:11.834
I've given you
first-class intel.

37:11.959 --> 37:13.417
They're
bloody elusive.

37:14.042 --> 37:16.459
Even when we know which ship
they're going to sink,

37:16.584 --> 37:19.459
locating the U-boat's attack
point is impossible.

37:19.584 --> 37:21.792
Trying to spot a sub
50 feet below the Atlantic

37:21.917 --> 37:24.417
is like trying to find
a hymen in a whorehouse.

37:24.542 --> 37:26.876
So, you need to wait for
them to rise to the surface.

37:27.001 --> 37:29.542
By which stage,
the subs are in attack mode.

37:29.667 --> 37:31.876
Do that
and you risk our ships.

37:32.001 --> 37:33.417
Do nothing
and the sub will live

37:33.542 --> 37:36.126
to attack another day.
We have to lull them in.

37:36.251 --> 37:37.501
Let them surface and fire,

37:37.626 --> 37:39.751
that way your fighter planes
are sure to spot them.

37:40.542 --> 37:41.834
Christ.

37:42.417 --> 37:45.542
You're suggesting we sacrifice
a civilian ship.

37:46.792 --> 37:48.376
A pawn for a queen.

38:01.959 --> 38:03.251
We should go back.

38:04.584 --> 38:08.376
Mm... No. She can do
the next broadcast alone.

38:10.542 --> 38:12.417
You and I are
otherwise engaged.

38:27.917 --> 38:29.667
The war
office has just announced

38:29.792 --> 38:32.001
that the RAF
has destroyed the entire

38:32.126 --> 38:33.417
- German U-boat fleet...
- Oh, my God.

38:33.542 --> 38:35.334
- ...in the Atlantic Ocean.
- Sebastian!

38:35.959 --> 38:37.209
This marks a huge...

38:37.334 --> 38:39.876
...turning point in the war
against Nazi Germany.

38:41.209 --> 38:43.209
Mr Churchill will address
the nation

38:43.334 --> 38:45.167
on this major development.

38:46.834 --> 38:49.501
This is the moment
when the RAF achieved

38:49.626 --> 38:50.834
what many said
was impossible.

38:50.959 --> 38:53.376
The annihilation
of the Nazi U-boat fleet.

38:53.501 --> 38:56.792
But this stunning victory
wasn't without cost.

38:56.917 --> 38:58.792
Tragically,
our forces were unable

38:58.917 --> 39:03.417
to save the American civilian
liner, SS Abraham Lincoln.

39:03.542 --> 39:06.167
Two thousand souls
lost their lives.

39:10.667 --> 39:12.917
Thom! Thom!

39:14.709 --> 39:16.001
Thom,
you're incredible.

39:16.126 --> 39:17.667
Champagne for Boudicca!

39:17.792 --> 39:19.376
Darling, are you okay?

39:20.542 --> 39:22.084
Did you enact
the battle right here?

39:22.209 --> 39:23.751
What happened?

39:23.876 --> 39:25.834
We received a report
of the Abraham Lincoln

39:25.959 --> 39:27.792
being attacked
by a flotilla of U-boats

39:27.917 --> 39:29.084
and once the attack started,

39:29.209 --> 39:30.876
Cobcroft had the subs bombed
from the air.

39:31.001 --> 39:32.001
Hang on.

39:33.584 --> 39:35.542
You allowed the attack
to start?

39:39.084 --> 39:40.876
Thom, they sunk
the Abraham Lincoln.

39:41.001 --> 39:42.792
We needed bait to get
the U-boats to rise.

39:45.376 --> 39:46.709
How many people
were on that liner?

39:46.834 --> 39:49.709
Well, army man,
it's the semiotics of combat.

39:49.834 --> 39:52.709
Those U-boats wiped out
40 liners last month.

39:52.834 --> 39:55.251
Now, we're going to destroy
the Kriegsmarine

39:55.376 --> 39:57.417
and then we'll go
after their air force.

39:57.542 --> 39:58.917
Let's get the shutters.

40:05.167 --> 40:06.542
Over 2,000 people died...

40:06.667 --> 40:08.251
- How did you do that?
- ...on the American liner.

40:08.376 --> 40:10.417
President Roosevelt
is demanding to know

40:10.542 --> 40:12.001
why Britain didn't deploy

40:12.126 --> 40:13.917
its celebrated
early warning system

40:14.042 --> 40:15.417
- to protect the vessel.
- Mars.

40:16.709 --> 40:18.459
Did you show him
how to work LOLA?

40:23.001 --> 40:24.542
Churchill's
hopes of persuading

40:24.667 --> 40:27.209
the United States of America
to abandon its neutrality

40:27.334 --> 40:28.459
have been dashed.

40:28.584 --> 40:31.001
Preliminary investigations
have found that the British

40:31.126 --> 40:33.584
deliberately allowed
the Abraham Lincoln to be sunk

40:33.709 --> 40:36.042
as a means to entice
the German U-boat fleet

40:36.167 --> 40:37.209
to the surface.

40:37.334 --> 40:38.292
What have you done?

40:38.417 --> 40:39.667
What have you been doing?

40:42.917 --> 40:44.417
You are a child.

40:45.501 --> 40:48.542
A lustful, suggestible child.

40:49.834 --> 40:51.126
The pair of you.

40:51.959 --> 40:53.167
- Thom, I...
- Get out.

40:53.292 --> 40:54.709
I shouldn't have...

40:54.834 --> 40:57.251
-Thom, I'm...
-Get out!

41:10.792 --> 41:12.709
Anger spilled
onto the streets today

41:12.834 --> 41:14.876
when State Department
investigators made

41:15.001 --> 41:16.667
the sensational discovery

41:16.792 --> 41:18.292
that Britain
had prior knowledge

41:18.417 --> 41:20.792
of the attack
on the Abraham Lincoln.

41:20.917 --> 41:22.417
According
to the investigators,

41:22.542 --> 41:25.376
British fighter pilots circled
overhead and looked on

41:25.501 --> 41:27.126
as dozens of Nazi subs

41:27.251 --> 41:29.209
attacked
the defenceless liner.

41:29.334 --> 41:30.917
Within minutes,
the doomed vessel

41:31.042 --> 41:32.126
lay at the bottom
of the Atlantic

41:32.251 --> 41:35.959
along with 2,000 men,
women and children.

41:36.084 --> 41:38.084
President Roosevelt said
it was clear

41:38.209 --> 41:40.167
that the British
had sacrificed the liner

41:40.292 --> 41:42.209
to draw the U-boats
to the surface.

41:42.334 --> 41:43.667
He immediately recalled

41:43.792 --> 41:45.834
Ambassador Joseph Kennedy
from London.

41:45.959 --> 41:49.709
I leave England at this time
with real regret.

41:52.917 --> 41:54.792
But England
remains defiant.

41:54.917 --> 41:58.584
Churchill strenuously rejected
the allegations

41:58.709 --> 42:02.459
and proclaimed that Britain
shall prevail without the aid

42:02.584 --> 42:05.251
of the United States
of America.

42:15.376 --> 42:16.959
Thom, come on, open up.

42:35.417 --> 42:36.417
She's mad.

42:39.459 --> 42:40.667
Fucking mad.

42:50.834 --> 42:54.542
LOLA had just received
the perfect piece of intel.

42:54.667 --> 42:55.709
It was irresistible.

42:55.834 --> 42:56.792
This is Southampton.

42:56.917 --> 42:59.542
We are under sustained attack,
six German destroyers...

42:59.667 --> 43:02.917
You had Cobcroft deploy
the entire navy to intercept

43:03.042 --> 43:05.876
an all-out German attack
on Southampton.

43:09.834 --> 43:12.126
This intel could wipe out
the German navy.

43:14.001 --> 43:15.042
This is fucking pathetic.

43:15.167 --> 43:16.542
It's petty. Come on, open up.

43:18.459 --> 43:20.459
But it was too good
to be true.

43:21.042 --> 43:22.084
I need your help.

43:27.584 --> 43:29.459
What the hell have you done?

43:30.334 --> 43:33.084
The Kriegsmarine is three
miles off the coast of Dover,

43:33.209 --> 43:36.792
our entire fleet is 100 miles
away in Southampton.

43:36.917 --> 43:38.084
The Kriegsmarine
should have arrived

43:38.209 --> 43:40.042
at Southampton one minute ago.

43:40.167 --> 43:41.542
Did you check
the signature code?

43:43.084 --> 43:44.709
Can you replay it?

43:48.542 --> 43:49.626
This is Southampton.

43:49.751 --> 43:52.667
We are under sustained attack,
six German destroyers

43:52.792 --> 43:55.209
supported by a heavy
air bombardment. Over.

43:55.334 --> 43:56.626
There's no signature code.

43:58.209 --> 43:59.251
It was a bogus signal,

43:59.376 --> 44:00.917
there was never an attack
on Southampton.

44:01.042 --> 44:02.292
The Germans know
we've got something.

44:02.417 --> 44:03.376
They must have sent
that signal.

44:03.501 --> 44:05.667
Oldest trick in the book.

44:05.792 --> 44:08.251
You've left us
completely exposed.

44:08.376 --> 44:10.917
You fucking bitch.
You've fucked me.

44:15.959 --> 44:17.459
Authorities are not revealing

44:17.584 --> 44:19.167
the extent of the attack,

44:19.292 --> 44:21.209
except to say
that the coast around Dover

44:21.334 --> 44:23.167
is now under
German occupation.

44:23.292 --> 44:25.709
No, no, no, no, no.

44:26.751 --> 44:27.709
Hello?

44:27.834 --> 44:29.417
There is going to be
an attack at Hastings.

44:29.542 --> 44:31.709
- Who is this?
- Cobcroft?

44:31.834 --> 44:33.501
Major Henry Cobcroft
is unavailable.

44:33.626 --> 44:35.417
No, I need to speak to
him now. Where the fuck is he?

44:35.542 --> 44:36.501
This is Lieutenant Holloway.

44:36.626 --> 44:37.667
I report directly
to Major Cobcroft.

44:37.792 --> 44:38.792
I need him on the line
immediately.

44:38.917 --> 44:40.667
Major Cobcroft
is not available.

44:40.792 --> 44:43.209
Then you... Go get him,
we're being invaded!

44:43.501 --> 44:45.292
- Where are you going?
- To...

44:45.917 --> 44:47.001
warn the army.

44:47.126 --> 44:49.334
- Hold on.
- Look, I'll be right back.

44:49.459 --> 44:52.501
And... try and connect
to someone on intel.

44:58.126 --> 44:59.084
...to move defences
away from...

45:02.959 --> 45:04.292
Can we undo this?

45:08.292 --> 45:09.792
Can I unbreak
that telephone?

45:34.376 --> 45:38.501
What the hell
had we done?

45:50.167 --> 45:51.126
Early this morning,

45:51.251 --> 45:52.959
catastrophe struck Britain.

45:53.084 --> 45:55.376
German forces breached
coastal defences

45:55.501 --> 45:58.001
following a major
intelligence blunder.

45:58.126 --> 46:00.667
Commanding officers
had diverted the RAF

46:00.792 --> 46:03.626
and the Royal Navy
to Southampton, leaving Dover

46:03.751 --> 46:06.876
and the Southeast of England
gravely exposed.

46:07.001 --> 46:08.917
The enemy launched
a full-scale invasion,

46:09.042 --> 46:11.042
landing effectively unopposed.

46:11.167 --> 46:14.292
Town after town fell
to the merciless attackers.

46:14.751 --> 46:17.084
Christening the invasion
Black Sunday,

46:17.209 --> 46:20.667
the Prime Minister issued
a full call to arms.

46:20.792 --> 46:23.001
The Battle
of Britain is about to begin.

46:23.126 --> 46:24.459
On this battle depends

46:24.584 --> 46:27.376
the survival
of Christian civilisation.

46:27.501 --> 46:29.084
If we fail,

46:29.209 --> 46:31.334
then the whole world will sink

46:31.459 --> 46:34.626
into the abyss
of a new Dark Age.

46:37.709 --> 46:39.334
With the Nazis
advancing inland,

46:39.459 --> 46:42.584
Head of Army Intelligence,
Major Sir Henry Cobcroft,

46:42.709 --> 46:45.084
was summoned to explain
the disastrous breach

46:45.209 --> 46:46.876
in Britain's defences.

46:47.001 --> 46:49.417
Major Cobcroft said
that after an investigation,

46:49.542 --> 46:51.709
he had discovered
that two Nazi double agents

46:51.834 --> 46:54.001
had infiltrated
his department.

46:56.126 --> 46:57.709
Lieutenant Holloway and I

46:57.834 --> 47:00.334
were receiving intelligence
from two agents,

47:01.167 --> 47:03.292
Thomasina and Martha Hanbury.

47:05.042 --> 47:06.376
They were double-crossing us.

47:07.084 --> 47:08.917
Taking orders from Berlin.

47:10.042 --> 47:12.584
Their maliciously false intel

47:12.709 --> 47:15.667
resulted in this country
being invaded.

47:17.209 --> 47:19.917
These loathsome creatures
will be found

47:20.834 --> 47:23.126
and hanged for treason.

47:23.251 --> 47:24.209
What do we do?

47:24.334 --> 47:25.376
On bidding farewell

47:25.501 --> 47:27.959
to the King,
who was evacuated to Canada,

47:28.084 --> 47:30.542
Mr Churchill addressed
the nation.

47:30.667 --> 47:33.001
Despite the
traitresses in our midst...

47:33.126 --> 47:34.084
Shit!

47:34.209 --> 47:36.834
...the Nazi forces
shall not prevail

47:36.959 --> 47:39.459
in their attempts
to break the spirit of...

47:39.584 --> 47:41.626
Thom,
we have to leave now.

47:41.751 --> 47:43.584
- I'm not leaving LOLA.
- For God's sake, Thom,

47:43.709 --> 47:45.501
what are you going to do,
put it in a suitcase?

47:45.626 --> 47:47.376
I'm staying.
I can still fight this,

47:47.501 --> 47:49.167
tell the army what the Germans
are going to do next.

47:49.292 --> 47:50.376
Never mind the Germans,

47:50.501 --> 47:52.292
it's Cobcroft
that's going to hang us.

47:52.417 --> 47:54.292
Then get your boyfriend
to tell them the truth.

47:55.042 --> 47:56.251
What?

47:56.376 --> 47:59.001
He's left you, Mars.
He's saving his own skin.

47:59.126 --> 48:00.209
Horseshit.

48:00.334 --> 48:02.001
He would have saved you
from yourself

48:02.126 --> 48:03.292
if you'd let him
check the codes.

48:03.417 --> 48:04.876
He was too busy
bonking you in the woods.

48:05.001 --> 48:05.959
You locked us out.

48:06.084 --> 48:07.251
You were
compromising my work

48:07.376 --> 48:08.626
with your sentimentality.

48:08.751 --> 48:11.126
I'd rather be
sentimental than psychotic.

48:11.251 --> 48:13.167
You are mawkish
and weak, just like Mama.

48:13.292 --> 48:14.584
And you're every bit

48:14.709 --> 48:16.042
as selfish as she was.

48:16.709 --> 48:17.667
Shit.

48:20.876 --> 48:22.251
Mars, let's just go.

52:08.584 --> 52:09.792
For fuck's sake.

52:10.334 --> 52:11.334
Pigs.

52:15.876 --> 52:17.334
Stop. Put the camera down.

52:18.709 --> 52:20.792
Mars, put it down.

52:23.709 --> 52:25.292
If they ask us, we're farmers.

52:29.417 --> 52:31.042
Where are you going?

52:31.167 --> 52:33.292
Home.
We live just down the coast.

52:34.751 --> 52:35.751
Papers.

52:36.626 --> 52:37.834
They're at home.

52:39.417 --> 52:41.417
If you allow us through,
I can get them for you.

52:43.834 --> 52:45.626
You will have to turn back.

52:45.751 --> 52:47.834
Please,
we're looking for my sister.

52:58.792 --> 52:59.959
Excuse me?

53:01.584 --> 53:02.834
You can't proceed.

53:08.376 --> 53:11.834
I said, turn back.

53:18.251 --> 53:20.917
For fuck's sake.
Pigs.

53:28.126 --> 53:29.334
British Fascist leader,

53:29.459 --> 53:30.959
Sir Oswald Mosley,
said it was folly

53:31.084 --> 53:32.376
to have gone to war
with Germany.

53:33.376 --> 53:34.917
Dissidents
of the new regime

53:35.042 --> 53:37.959
had set up a refuge
in an old warehouse.

53:38.084 --> 53:39.167
We were happy just to be safe.

53:39.292 --> 53:41.126
Oh, this is the tip
of the iceberg.

53:41.251 --> 53:43.126
The unseen face of Fascism.

53:43.876 --> 53:45.334
If you can get these pictures
out to America,

53:45.459 --> 53:47.334
it might help counter
all the propaganda.

53:47.459 --> 53:49.334
Hey! Stop that!

53:49.459 --> 53:51.584
What's wrong?

53:51.709 --> 53:52.917
You know, like the colour
of the sky

53:53.042 --> 53:54.376
- before it goes to night time.
- Nice.

53:54.501 --> 53:55.542
- It's that kind of thing.
- Nice.

53:55.667 --> 53:57.167
- Indigo.
- Yeah.

53:57.292 --> 53:59.292
Oy!

54:02.167 --> 54:03.376
Oy!

54:03.501 --> 54:04.917
You need
something to do.

54:05.042 --> 54:06.042
Little rascal.

54:07.126 --> 54:10.542
So, Leo, here is how we put
the bits of film together

54:10.667 --> 54:12.667
to make the images
become a story.

54:14.709 --> 54:17.376
So, erm, hold it still.

54:18.084 --> 54:19.167
Still.

54:19.292 --> 54:21.584
And allow the camera
to become your eye.

54:21.709 --> 54:23.709
Try to figure out where
you should be looking next.

54:25.209 --> 54:27.542
Yeah, so maybe down
to my hands

54:27.667 --> 54:29.751
if I'm playing
with these things.

54:29.876 --> 54:31.126
Onto my hands, like this.

54:32.001 --> 54:34.584
Or maybe over to there

54:35.667 --> 54:36.709
where I'm talking to you

54:36.834 --> 54:38.209
and then back
to my face again.

54:39.167 --> 54:40.292
That's it.

54:41.126 --> 54:42.709
And a bit more upright.

54:44.792 --> 54:46.001
I think you're a natural.

55:03.209 --> 55:05.001
...Mosley to lead Britain

55:05.126 --> 55:08.501
to a new prosperity
and friendship with Germany.

55:08.626 --> 55:10.709
I claim that in the ranks

55:10.834 --> 55:12.626
of our Blackshirt legions,

55:12.751 --> 55:15.917
march the mighty ghosts
of England's past.

55:22.959 --> 55:24.626
Today,
our new German liberators

55:24.751 --> 55:27.667
freed more political prisoners
detained under the old regime.

55:27.792 --> 55:29.417
-There's Leo.
-Amongst those released

55:29.542 --> 55:32.417
were scientist Thomasina
Hanbury, falsely accused...

55:35.917 --> 55:38.084
...by the previous government.
Miss Hanbury's research

55:38.209 --> 55:40.709
is of great interest
to the Third Reich.

56:00.501 --> 56:02.001
Try to keep
the camera still.

56:04.376 --> 56:07.167
This evening, we are joined
by a very special guest,

56:07.292 --> 56:09.292
Miss Thomasina Hanbury,

56:09.417 --> 56:12.167
a self-educated orphan
who was condemned to death

56:12.292 --> 56:14.709
by the old regime
three months ago,

56:14.834 --> 56:16.376
only to be
dramatically rescued

56:16.501 --> 56:19.792
by our liberators mere hours
before her execution.

56:19.917 --> 56:21.459
Since then,
she has transformed

56:21.584 --> 56:22.542
the nation's fortunes

56:22.667 --> 56:25.042
in the field
of strategic forecasting.

56:25.167 --> 56:29.042
Of particular note is her
mysterious invention, LOLA.

56:29.167 --> 56:33.042
Miss Hanbury, may I ask,
how does your machine work?

56:34.209 --> 56:37.334
It consists of a system
of electrical processors

56:37.459 --> 56:39.126
which filter and amplify

56:39.251 --> 56:41.376
even the faintest
electromagnetic wave

56:41.501 --> 56:43.001
into a coherent signal.

56:44.042 --> 56:45.584
And when combined
with an understanding

56:45.709 --> 56:47.459
of quantum mechanics,
LOLA allows us

56:47.584 --> 56:49.251
to observe broadcasts
from the future.

56:49.542 --> 56:50.917
How impressive.

56:51.542 --> 56:53.334
I hear the machine has baffled

56:53.459 --> 56:57.251
the greatest engineering minds
of both Britain and Germany.

56:57.376 --> 56:59.042
The men they sent
to examine LOLA

56:59.167 --> 57:01.542
were limited
by their lack of imagination

57:01.667 --> 57:04.251
as much as their formal
scientific training.

57:04.376 --> 57:06.751
Thankfully, I prefer
to work alone.

57:06.876 --> 57:08.667
My home laboratory
is everything I need.

57:08.792 --> 57:11.751
What inspired you
to build this machine?

57:14.209 --> 57:18.459
My father was an inventor,
an idealist.

57:18.584 --> 57:19.667
And he believed

57:19.792 --> 57:21.626
humankind was being
transformed for the better

57:21.751 --> 57:23.334
by technological advances.

57:23.459 --> 57:25.459
The work I do today
strives to this ideal.

57:25.584 --> 57:27.126
To what end?

57:27.251 --> 57:28.751
To create the perfect society.

57:29.376 --> 57:31.751
A society in which
we all prosper.

57:31.876 --> 57:34.167
No government blunders
that send people into poverty.

57:34.292 --> 57:35.417
No more murders
on the streets.

57:35.542 --> 57:37.042
No conflicts and no war.

57:37.792 --> 57:41.709
You've personally experienced
your fair share of adversity.

57:42.459 --> 57:45.292
After the tragic death
of your parents,

57:45.417 --> 57:48.876
you were left alone
to raise your sister, Martha,

57:49.626 --> 57:52.209
while still very much
a child yourself.

57:52.334 --> 57:54.292
That must have been difficult.

57:55.209 --> 57:56.417
We managed.

57:57.834 --> 58:01.084
Your current standing must be
all the more gratifying

58:01.209 --> 58:02.959
considering
the disgraceful way

58:03.084 --> 58:05.917
Churchill's government
treated you and your sister,

58:06.042 --> 58:08.542
who was sadly executed

58:08.667 --> 58:10.042
before the liberators
could reach her.

58:10.167 --> 58:12.584
There was nothing gratifying
about my sister's death.

58:15.459 --> 58:17.459
When I received the news,
it was...

58:18.584 --> 58:19.876
a horrible blow.

58:20.667 --> 58:22.084
She deserved better.

58:26.959 --> 58:31.084
It is a shame that LOLA
can't fix the past.

58:31.209 --> 58:35.417
If Martha were alive today,
what would you say to her?

58:37.251 --> 58:38.959
I would tell her
to live her life...

58:40.792 --> 58:42.251
and to leave me behind.

58:49.584 --> 58:51.126
We need to get her
out of there.

58:52.876 --> 58:54.334
It's too dangerous.
She'll get killed.

58:54.459 --> 58:55.792
Well, she never goes a day
without swimming,

58:55.917 --> 58:57.376
-so we can go and get her.
-Martha.

58:58.334 --> 59:00.167
Look at me. We're safe here.

59:01.084 --> 59:02.792
Let go of me.

59:03.459 --> 59:05.251
I'm going to get her.
I'm going to find her now.

59:05.376 --> 59:06.501
How are you
gonna get there?

59:06.626 --> 59:07.834
Are you gonna
come with me or not?

59:08.251 --> 59:09.209
Fine, just let me go...

59:09.334 --> 59:10.292
They're looking for you...

59:10.417 --> 59:11.376
Just let me go
on my own. I'm fine.

59:11.501 --> 59:13.042
- You're not safe.
- I don't need you.

59:48.709 --> 59:50.459
Mars,
get out of here.

59:50.584 --> 59:51.584
Wait.

59:53.292 --> 59:55.709
- Look.
- What are you doing here?

59:55.834 --> 59:57.376
- Get out of there.
- Intruder!

59:57.501 --> 59:58.959
Mars! Go on, go!

01:00:01.584 --> 01:00:03.167
Sebastian!

01:00:21.167 --> 01:00:25.667
I drew a line
In the sands of time

01:00:27.709 --> 01:00:31.459
Dared you to step over it

01:00:33.334 --> 01:00:34.917
And you did

01:00:40.917 --> 01:00:45.209
Saw your visage
In the looking glass

01:00:47.459 --> 01:00:49.459
Such a pretty face

01:00:50.542 --> 01:00:53.959
But such a bitter taste

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:58.126
Do you remember tomorrow?

01:00:58.251 --> 01:01:01.417
The roads that we followed

01:01:01.542 --> 01:01:06.001
To a life that might
Never come to be

01:01:08.042 --> 01:01:12.792
The future is a distant memory

01:01:12.917 --> 01:01:14.626
To me now

01:01:24.126 --> 01:01:25.376
Let me guess.

01:01:26.501 --> 01:01:27.501
Bob Dylan?

01:01:29.376 --> 01:01:31.042
No. That was me.

01:02:04.292 --> 01:02:07.209
My world became
empty and cold.

01:02:09.667 --> 01:02:13.959
You, on the other hand,
were soaring to new heights.

01:02:18.667 --> 01:02:20.292
The sound of marching feet

01:02:20.417 --> 01:02:21.917
Can you hear it?

01:02:22.042 --> 01:02:23.792
The sound of marching feet

01:02:23.917 --> 01:02:27.334
In the street below

01:02:28.709 --> 01:02:30.167
Together we are strong

01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:31.959
Crush the weaklings

01:02:32.084 --> 01:02:33.251
So sing our fascist song

01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:37.876
In the street below

01:02:39.626 --> 01:02:42.042
Send to all the world
a message.

01:02:42.167 --> 01:02:45.084
England lives and marches on!

01:02:46.876 --> 01:02:49.376
Learn to march in time

01:02:50.042 --> 01:02:52.084
And fall into line

01:02:52.209 --> 01:02:53.542
The sound of marching feet

01:02:54.042 --> 01:02:55.376
Can you feel it?

01:02:55.501 --> 01:02:57.334
The sound of marching feet

01:02:57.459 --> 01:03:02.042
See the torches glow

01:03:03.751 --> 01:03:07.084
Put this record on

01:03:07.209 --> 01:03:09.959
Learn all of the lyrics

01:03:10.084 --> 01:03:13.084
If your friends
Don't sing along

01:03:13.834 --> 01:03:15.417
Call the police

01:03:20.417 --> 01:03:23.042
The sound of marching feet

01:03:23.667 --> 01:03:28.667
Left, right, left, left, left
Left, right, left

01:03:28.792 --> 01:03:32.167
Left, left, left, right, left

01:03:32.292 --> 01:03:33.709
Left, left

01:03:33.834 --> 01:03:36.501
The sound of marching feet

01:03:36.626 --> 01:03:38.917
Left, left, left, right, left

01:03:39.042 --> 01:03:42.167
Left, left, left, right, left

01:03:42.292 --> 01:03:44.376
-The sound of marching feet
-The sound of marching feet

01:03:44.501 --> 01:03:46.792
-The sound of marching feet
-The sound of marching feet

01:03:46.917 --> 01:03:48.959
-The sound of marching feet
-The sound of marching feet

01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:56.917
Do not fraternise

01:03:57.042 --> 01:04:00.292
With radicals and perverts

01:04:00.417 --> 01:04:03.584
Learn to march in time

01:04:03.709 --> 01:04:06.084
And fall into line

01:04:24.001 --> 01:04:27.042
There was only one thing
left for me to do.

01:04:42.167 --> 01:04:45.417
Today, the Prime Minister
announced that Adolf Hitler

01:04:45.542 --> 01:04:48.709
will be making his first
state visit to England.

01:04:48.834 --> 01:04:51.417
The Führer will be dropping in
on a very special house

01:04:51.542 --> 01:04:54.084
on the Sussex Coast,
where government scientist

01:04:54.209 --> 01:04:58.084
Thomasina Hanbury has been
conducting pioneering work.

01:04:58.709 --> 01:05:00.501
Because of
this remarkable woman,

01:05:00.626 --> 01:05:03.001
rescued and championed
by the Führer,

01:05:03.126 --> 01:05:04.959
we say to our enemies,

01:05:05.084 --> 01:05:07.751
"Watch out, we know
what you're going to do

01:05:07.876 --> 01:05:09.584
"before you even think of it."

01:05:09.709 --> 01:05:12.376
And now, it is my pleasure
to introduce you

01:05:12.501 --> 01:05:17.626
to Master Reginald Watson,
the voice of the future.

01:05:17.751 --> 01:05:24.376
Land of Hope
Thy hope is crowned

01:05:24.959 --> 01:05:31.709
God make thee mightier yet

01:05:40.584 --> 01:05:43.751
On sovereign brows

01:05:43.876 --> 01:05:47.209
Beloved

01:05:47.334 --> 01:05:52.459
Once more thy crown is set

01:05:55.042 --> 01:05:57.126
Leo, stop filming.

01:05:58.084 --> 01:06:03.001
God, who made thee mighty

01:06:04.417 --> 01:06:10.876
Make thee mightier yet

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:17.917
God, who made thee mighty

01:06:18.042 --> 01:06:24.542
Make thee mightier yet

01:07:38.251 --> 01:07:39.251
At the rally,

01:07:39.376 --> 01:07:41.667
President Lindbergh celebrated
how National Socialism

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:43.709
had brought the American
people together and...

01:07:53.626 --> 01:07:54.751
...developed by British

01:07:54.876 --> 01:07:57.001
and German scientists,
this is the ultimate weapon

01:07:57.126 --> 01:07:58.376
against the Bolshevik.

01:08:04.584 --> 01:08:06.167
Martha
Hanbury had entered the house

01:08:06.292 --> 01:08:08.251
with the intention
of assassinating the Führer

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:10.834
but, fortuitously, her bomb
went off prematurely

01:08:10.959 --> 01:08:12.334
in an adjoining room,

01:08:12.459 --> 01:08:14.459
and the deranged woman
was captured.

01:08:14.584 --> 01:08:15.542
The shocked Führer

01:08:15.667 --> 01:08:16.709
- escaped unscathed...
- Mars.

01:08:16.834 --> 01:08:19.126
...and issued an order
for the female terrorist

01:08:19.251 --> 01:08:20.917
to be put to death
immediately.

01:08:52.626 --> 01:08:56.584
There is
Nothing so gladdens the heart

01:08:57.667 --> 01:09:01.709
Than to watch a traitor march

01:09:01.834 --> 01:09:04.876
To the gallows

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:09.626
To the gallows

01:09:10.417 --> 01:09:11.584
Hold!

01:09:18.167 --> 01:09:22.334
Like a gardener pulling weeds

01:09:23.084 --> 01:09:27.251
The path of treason only leads

01:09:27.376 --> 01:09:30.126
To the gallows

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:33.042
I'm so glad
I bought you that car.

01:09:33.167 --> 01:09:34.709
To the gallows

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:39.542
I hid for days.

01:10:53.584 --> 01:10:56.959
When the Nazis left,
I returned...

01:11:01.042 --> 01:11:02.376
and found this.

01:11:08.584 --> 01:11:10.709
April 12th, '42.

01:11:11.751 --> 01:11:14.459
Preparations for LOLA's
demonstration are complete.

01:11:16.042 --> 01:11:18.167
It's hard to believe
I am saying these words.

01:11:19.001 --> 01:11:21.834
Adolf Hitler will be
here tomorrow.

01:11:23.542 --> 01:11:25.792
How's it come to this?

01:11:26.792 --> 01:11:29.084
Fascism has truly won.

01:11:30.626 --> 01:11:31.584
I was a fool to believe

01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:33.084
I could work
with these people.

01:11:34.251 --> 01:11:37.292
What would Papa think?
Or Mars?

01:11:39.084 --> 01:11:40.292
I'm almost glad
they're not alive

01:11:40.417 --> 01:11:41.959
to witness this spectacle.

01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:47.917
I don't know when
it started to go wrong,

01:11:48.792 --> 01:11:50.959
but I fear it was long ago.

01:11:52.376 --> 01:11:55.167
LOLA was never meant to be
an instrument of violence.

01:11:56.126 --> 01:11:57.376
Mars was right.

01:11:58.251 --> 01:12:00.501
The magic of LOLA
was the beauty

01:12:00.626 --> 01:12:02.709
of the world
she opened for us,

01:12:03.626 --> 01:12:06.042
those sounds and images
from another time.

01:12:07.751 --> 01:12:10.084
Her power lay in what
we could learn from her.

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:12.084
Mars understood that.

01:12:13.959 --> 01:12:16.542
But perhaps because
she was a dreamer,

01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:20.876
she was the one
with the real imagination.

01:12:21.001 --> 01:12:22.417
I can see that now.

01:12:24.792 --> 01:12:26.251
Maybe if she were here,

01:12:27.001 --> 01:12:29.584
we could find a way
to undo all of this together.

01:12:32.584 --> 01:12:33.709
I miss her.

01:12:37.167 --> 01:12:39.126
I miss you too, Thom.

01:12:40.542 --> 01:12:43.792
But maybe there is a way
we can undo this together.

01:12:44.834 --> 01:12:47.167
I've made this film for you.

01:12:48.542 --> 01:12:52.126
It's the last broadcast
of the Angel of Portobello.

01:12:53.126 --> 01:12:54.459
It's a shot in the dark.

01:12:56.042 --> 01:12:58.209
And I'm sorry, Thom,

01:12:58.334 --> 01:13:00.209
because if this film doesn't
find its way to you,

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:03.626
then you will have died
pointlessly and stupidly,

01:13:03.751 --> 01:13:07.084
and I will truly
have lost everything.

01:13:10.417 --> 01:13:12.751
We will all have lost
more than is bearable.

01:13:16.167 --> 01:13:18.709
This film is for us, Thom.

01:13:20.626 --> 01:13:21.584
And if we're lucky,

01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:25.167
you'll be watching it long
before this horror unfolds.

01:13:27.459 --> 01:13:31.126
Then perhaps you can turn
these words and images

01:13:31.251 --> 01:13:33.834
into shadows of something
that could have happened.

01:13:36.417 --> 01:13:37.751
Even though I'll have
to say goodbye

01:13:37.876 --> 01:13:39.292
to the man I'll never meet.

01:13:42.876 --> 01:13:44.126
Darling Thom...

01:13:45.751 --> 01:13:48.167
can you save us after all?

01:14:31.126 --> 01:14:36.292
When, when, when

01:14:36.417 --> 01:14:41.751
Will we be together again?

01:14:44.959 --> 01:14:49.042
I want to spend

01:14:49.167 --> 01:14:53.542
My life with you

01:14:55.917 --> 01:14:58.792
I really miss you, honey

01:14:58.917 --> 01:15:03.834
When, when, when

01:15:03.959 --> 01:15:08.751
Will your arms enfold me?

01:15:08.876 --> 01:15:14.209
And hold me like
Your life on it depends

01:15:14.334 --> 01:15:17.876
When, when

01:15:18.001 --> 01:15:23.459
Will I see you again?

01:15:23.584 --> 01:15:27.751
I really miss you
