00:41.752 --> 00:43.818
Hey, babe. How was work?

00:46.623 --> 00:49.659
It was fine.

00:49.660 --> 00:52.227
What's wrong? Something happen?

00:53.864 --> 00:58.833
I'm just... I'm searching for
these words to say to you right now.

01:00.003 --> 01:02.971
Oh, just say it.

01:06.543 --> 01:08.943
I slept with my ex.

01:09.980 --> 01:11.545
I didn't mean to do it
and it just happened.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.154
And I didn't do it on purpose.

01:13.179 --> 01:15.594
Bitch, I don't want
your sloppy second ass!

01:15.619 --> 01:17.752
I ain't Russell Wilson
in this motherfucker!

01:41.612 --> 01:43.211
Hey, babe. How was work?

01:45.649 --> 01:48.918
It was splendid.

01:48.919 --> 01:51.369
Splendid? We're using splendid now?

01:52.456 --> 01:53.588
Hey.

01:53.642 --> 01:56.993
- What's wrong?
- Why do you think something's wrong?

01:56.994 --> 01:59.395
I don't know. You just seem off.

01:59.396 --> 02:03.298
Oh, it was just... it
was a long day at work.

02:04.178 --> 02:07.413
Well, maybe I can make it better.

02:14.556 --> 02:15.556
_

02:15.581 --> 02:16.723
Wait, what?

02:16.724 --> 02:18.825
Where's the "Broken Pussy" video?

02:18.826 --> 02:22.003
I called a guy I used to work
with and he got it taken down.

02:22.346 --> 02:24.431
- Like, everywhere?
- Yep.

02:24.432 --> 02:26.700
If you Google your name,
the only thing that comes up

02:26.701 --> 02:31.671
is your Facebook page and
a singer named Issa Sekibo.

02:31.672 --> 02:34.341
He sounds like a
Nigerian Ruben Studdard.

02:39.380 --> 02:41.715
What... hey, why are you crying?

02:41.716 --> 02:44.751
- Because of what you did.
- Babe, it was nothing.

02:44.752 --> 02:47.354
No, you took care of it.

02:47.355 --> 02:49.222
And you're always taking care of me.

02:49.223 --> 02:52.057
You're like my black Spider-Man.

02:52.860 --> 02:55.162
Hey. Hey, come here. Come here.

02:55.163 --> 02:59.032
- Now I got snot all on you.
- Hey, it's okay!

03:01.235 --> 03:04.403
I just love you so much.

03:06.374 --> 03:08.041
I love you, too.

03:08.042 --> 03:12.145
No, but, like, I really love you.

03:12.146 --> 03:14.114
And I appreciate you

03:14.115 --> 03:17.816
and I never wanna forget that.

03:19.320 --> 03:22.022
You know, I like getting all this love.

03:24.025 --> 03:26.626
What are you gonna do when I tell you
I picked up your dry cleaning today?

03:28.196 --> 03:29.963
No, you weren't supposed to cry.

03:42.944 --> 03:45.479
Babe, my teeth feel clean as fuck.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.714
These new floss things,
they really get in there.

03:47.715 --> 03:51.150
- Look.
- They look good, babe.

03:51.953 --> 03:54.119
- Come here.
- Oh.

04:03.631 --> 04:05.465
- What?
- Uh, nothing.

04:05.466 --> 04:06.867
I got the chills real quick.

04:06.868 --> 04:09.302
Oh. Come here. Let me warm you up.

04:09.303 --> 04:11.503
- Okay.
- Come on.

04:15.843 --> 04:17.209
Mm-hmm.

04:29.814 --> 04:31.625
What? You still cold?
You need blankets? What?

04:31.626 --> 04:35.728
Um, no. I think the video has
just been stressing me out.

04:37.365 --> 04:40.600
Can we just... can we just lay here?

04:40.601 --> 04:42.469
Yeah.

04:42.470 --> 04:43.703
Sure.

04:43.704 --> 04:45.705
You sure? You're not mad?

04:45.706 --> 04:48.340
Nah, I'm cool.

04:49.143 --> 04:51.878
- Thanks, babe.
- Mm-hmm.

05:05.927 --> 05:08.227
What the fuck?

05:28.282 --> 05:29.683
Hey.

05:29.684 --> 05:31.284
Hey.

05:31.285 --> 05:36.289
Uh, thanks for letting
me stay here last night.

05:36.290 --> 05:39.625
You didn't really leave
me much of a choice.

05:42.296 --> 05:44.464
Is that Cookie Crisp?

05:44.465 --> 05:46.666
Dang, I haven't had that
since, like, elementary.

05:46.667 --> 05:49.903
So, what was last night about?

05:49.904 --> 05:53.640
You show up faded at
my place out of nowhere.

05:53.641 --> 05:57.077
Yeah, I was just going through
something with this dude

05:57.078 --> 06:00.080
and I guess my drunk
brain just led me here.

06:00.081 --> 06:01.480
Okay.

06:03.884 --> 06:05.150
What?

06:06.187 --> 06:07.954
You know,

06:07.955 --> 06:10.657
it's fine if you and I didn't work out.

06:10.658 --> 06:14.560
But it just feels like you're playing
games, and I'm not really about that.

06:15.529 --> 06:17.030
You're right.

06:17.031 --> 06:18.965
You know, I was doing the most,

06:18.966 --> 06:22.067
but, you know, I really did like you.

06:24.772 --> 06:29.975
All right, I fucked up and you didn't
deserve any of that, and I'm sorry.

06:34.115 --> 06:37.684
You know what? I suck.
I'm... I'm just gonna go.

06:37.685 --> 06:40.452
Yeah, this is... I'm not...

06:44.759 --> 06:46.359
Don't smile.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.926
You ain't getting no milk.

06:49.864 --> 06:51.097
Okay.

06:51.098 --> 06:52.598
Thanks.

06:53.901 --> 06:56.802
Your hair looks great
like that, by the way.

06:57.738 --> 06:59.973
So, what are you doing today?

06:59.974 --> 07:02.142
Uh, just... I have errands.

07:02.143 --> 07:03.809
You need a ride?

07:06.547 --> 07:09.416
You still got errands?

07:09.417 --> 07:11.117
- No! I...
- You still got errands?

07:11.118 --> 07:13.219
I ain't got no errands!
I ain't got no errands!

07:25.790 --> 07:27.133
Is that pork bacon?

07:27.134 --> 07:28.635
What's the occasion?

07:28.636 --> 07:31.771
Can't I just wake up and wanna
cook breakfast for my bae?

07:31.772 --> 07:35.308
Yeah, you can, but it just feels so new.

07:35.309 --> 07:39.177
I just wanted to thank
you, you know, officially.

07:41.048 --> 07:43.283
You're not even ready
for this shit, okay?

07:43.284 --> 07:45.285
- So, we got real bacon...
- Mm-hmm.

07:45.286 --> 07:48.788
... blueberry waffles,
eggs lightly scrambled,

07:48.789 --> 07:50.990
plus strawberries and pineapples.

07:50.991 --> 07:52.392
What?!

07:52.393 --> 07:54.461
Damn, Iss!

07:54.462 --> 07:57.430
And I was thinking we
should go out later.

07:57.431 --> 08:00.066
You know, it's been a minute
since we had a date night.

08:00.067 --> 08:02.202
Yeah, you know I'm down.

08:02.203 --> 08:04.204
- Okay.
- Look at you.

08:04.205 --> 08:05.905
Cooking breakfast, making dinner plans.

08:05.906 --> 08:08.341
Yo, I got me a real one.

08:08.342 --> 08:10.909
All right, hand me some fruit.

08:11.812 --> 08:13.313
And, Frieda, where are we

08:13.314 --> 08:15.515
on the silent auction
items for the fundraiser?

08:15.516 --> 08:18.451
It's going great. The
Rams are donating tickets.

08:18.452 --> 08:20.820
- Dulan's is donating a private dinner,
- _

08:20.821 --> 08:23.723
but we are still waiting on a
jersey signed by Kobe Bryant.

08:23.724 --> 08:27.060
- I saw him at Katsuya once.
- Oh. Hmm.

08:27.061 --> 08:30.530
And have we secured
a location in Malibu?

08:30.531 --> 08:34.100
Oh, we have several
options that I can show you,

08:34.101 --> 08:37.169
but most places are saying
that we can't bring kids

08:37.171 --> 08:38.837
because they're worried about damage.

08:38.839 --> 08:40.506
But a lot of them are saying

08:40.508 --> 08:43.042
that they'll provide chairs and
tables at no additional cost.

08:43.043 --> 08:46.112
I thought the whole point
was to invite kids this year.

08:46.113 --> 08:49.048
Yeah. Why are we pressed
to do it in Malibu?

08:49.049 --> 08:52.185
Did you hear the part
about the tables and chairs?

08:52.186 --> 08:55.588
I did, but can't we
do it somewhere near,

08:55.589 --> 08:58.958
like Inglewood or Baldwin Hills?

08:58.959 --> 09:02.829
I mean, Malibu's nice, it's just
We Got Y'all is in this community.

09:02.830 --> 09:04.798
It would just be great to show the kids

09:04.799 --> 09:07.466
that there's beauty
in their own backyard.

09:11.672 --> 09:14.574
- I think that's a great idea.
- Me, too!

09:14.575 --> 09:17.477
Not that you asked. I'm just adding.

09:17.478 --> 09:19.445
Okay.

09:19.446 --> 09:21.179
- Moving on.
- _

09:37.531 --> 09:41.501
Okay, "Add basil, cook for one minute."

09:41.502 --> 09:43.203
Can do, bitch.

09:47.041 --> 09:48.707
Yeah!

09:50.578 --> 09:52.245
Yo, you know what?

09:52.246 --> 09:54.447
Chrissy Teigan has a dope-ass cookbook.

09:54.448 --> 09:57.283
Are you in the kitchen?
Please get the fuck out.

09:57.284 --> 09:58.718
No, I will not.

09:58.719 --> 10:00.653
I'm cooking for somebody.

10:00.654 --> 10:02.055
Who, that lawyer nigga?

10:02.056 --> 10:04.524
Okay, is this a shade-free zone?

10:04.525 --> 10:07.527
- Never.
- Okay, you remember Jared?

10:07.528 --> 10:10.630
Are... you are the worst!

10:10.631 --> 10:13.800
- Girl, I know, right?
- So, what happened with The League?

10:13.801 --> 10:15.568
Girl, I'm over them niggas.

10:15.569 --> 10:17.971
Like, they look good on paper,
but they on some bullshit.

10:17.972 --> 10:22.742
- So, you're with Jared now?
- Girl, I know, right?

10:22.743 --> 10:25.311
Life is a funny thing.

10:25.312 --> 10:27.347
I can't get into it while
I'm sautÃ©ing and basting,

10:27.348 --> 10:30.183
but the point is we
talked, he checked me.

10:30.184 --> 10:32.085
I mean, we had a real
honest conversation.

10:32.086 --> 10:35.187
I just like that we can
just share and be real.

10:36.123 --> 10:37.490
Tsk, you fucked that nigga.

10:37.491 --> 10:38.858
Yes. Yes, I did.

10:38.859 --> 10:40.460
That is not the point!

10:40.461 --> 10:43.363
I mean, it was different.
It just felt different.

10:43.364 --> 10:46.731
Well, okay, girl! Look at you.

10:47.968 --> 10:51.004
- Was it good?
- Bitch!

10:51.005 --> 10:53.006
Oh, wait, I gotta go. He's here.

10:53.007 --> 10:54.539
Bye.

11:02.249 --> 11:05.383
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:10.057 --> 11:12.659
Thank you, Chrissy!

11:12.660 --> 11:16.394
- Have you tried Blue Apron?
- Stay focused!

11:20.367 --> 11:23.369
Yo, next time, we're
getting two popcorns.

11:23.370 --> 11:25.872
- I barely ate any.
- I did not eat that much.

11:25.873 --> 11:27.806
No? None fell down your dress?

11:29.143 --> 11:30.710
Wow! Look at all that.

11:30.711 --> 11:32.478
Those were there before we came.

11:32.479 --> 11:33.912
Yeah.

11:34.949 --> 11:37.150
Hey, let's go in here for a sec.

11:37.151 --> 11:38.518
For what?

11:38.519 --> 11:40.586
I've been thinking about
getting a nose ring.

11:40.587 --> 11:43.856
- Stud or hoop?
- It don't matter as long as it's gold.

11:51.098 --> 11:52.699
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:52.700 --> 11:55.935
Uh, can I see a marquis
cut with a platinum band?

11:55.936 --> 11:58.037
The man knows what he wants.

11:58.038 --> 12:00.006
What you know about a marquis cut?

12:00.007 --> 12:02.075
The diamonds in this setting

12:02.076 --> 12:05.243
begin in a half carat
and go up to three.

12:07.281 --> 12:10.683
Um, this one?

12:10.684 --> 12:12.017
That's very nice.

12:12.987 --> 12:14.452
Thank you.

12:19.526 --> 12:21.159
Wow.

12:22.062 --> 12:24.163
Do you like that?

12:24.164 --> 12:26.798
Do you like that?

12:27.835 --> 12:30.769
Like that?

12:33.741 --> 12:35.108
What?

12:35.109 --> 12:36.376
Um, can we go?

12:36.377 --> 12:38.678
- What? Why?
- I just don't feel good.

12:38.679 --> 12:41.314
I, um... I think I had too
much junk at the movies.

12:41.315 --> 12:43.148
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

12:44.151 --> 12:46.518
It's okay.

12:48.088 --> 12:51.724
You're lying! I cannot
see you as a fat kid.

12:51.725 --> 12:54.460
Husky. My mom said I was husky.

12:54.461 --> 12:57.764
Oh, okay. Your mom sounds
like a lovely woman.

12:57.765 --> 12:59.465
She is. She's nice.

12:59.466 --> 13:00.967
Oh, my mom, oh, my gosh.

13:00.968 --> 13:02.235
She was always on me.

13:02.236 --> 13:04.103
I remember my first year in college.

13:04.104 --> 13:06.005
I wilded out just to piss her off.

13:06.006 --> 13:09.542
Really? I wanna hear more
about this wild Molly.

13:09.543 --> 13:11.310
Uh, no. That's okay.

13:11.311 --> 13:13.980
Nah. What? Did you go to juvie?

13:13.981 --> 13:16.349
- You were slanging that rock?
- Shut up.

13:16.350 --> 13:21.287
- No. I just did young, dumb shit.
- Okay.

13:21.288 --> 13:24.857
Like, I may or may not have
slept with a college professor.

13:24.858 --> 13:26.993
Wow!

13:26.994 --> 13:29.128
Okay. More, please.

13:29.129 --> 13:32.398
Oh, my... no. Ugh, okay.

13:32.399 --> 13:35.034
Um, all right. Also in college,

13:35.035 --> 13:37.837
I made out with a girl at a frat party.

13:37.838 --> 13:39.772
Mm, see, I'm not mad at that.

13:39.773 --> 13:41.874
- Of course you're not.
- Okay, what else?

13:41.875 --> 13:43.476
Ugh, okay.

13:43.477 --> 13:46.320
Um, I did coke for, like,
a hot second in law school.

13:46.345 --> 13:47.383
Mm-hmm.

13:47.408 --> 13:49.649
And I also had my tongue
pierced for, like, a month.

13:49.650 --> 13:52.218
But, wait, why am I
the only one sharing?

13:52.219 --> 13:55.021
No, where's your dirt? No, bring it.

13:55.022 --> 13:58.157
Okay, um... oh.

13:58.158 --> 14:01.527
I ran naked through a
Best Western one time.

14:01.528 --> 14:03.362
I was so fucking high.

14:03.363 --> 14:05.465
Um, please come harder, okay?

14:05.466 --> 14:08.267
Oh, okay. I slept with my first boss.

14:08.268 --> 14:10.002
And she was married.

14:10.003 --> 14:12.405
- Oh, shit!
- Mm-hmm.

14:12.406 --> 14:15.908
- The husky home-wrecker.
- Yeah.

14:15.909 --> 14:17.677
That's what they called me.

14:17.678 --> 14:19.812
Wow, okay. What else you got?

14:19.813 --> 14:23.549
When I was 20, I kind of had
a sexual experience like yours.

14:23.550 --> 14:25.118
What you mean?

14:25.119 --> 14:27.319
I messed around with a guy before.

14:29.156 --> 14:32.658
- Wait, you did what?
- I mean, it was, like, a long time ago.

14:32.659 --> 14:35.194
My friend and I were at
this party in New York,

14:35.195 --> 14:36.629
both super drunk.

14:36.630 --> 14:39.565
Went back to his place
and then, you know,

14:39.566 --> 14:42.467
it just kind of happened.

14:43.604 --> 14:46.672
Wh-what kind of happened?

14:46.673 --> 14:48.773
He went down on me.

14:51.044 --> 14:54.180
Oh, so you're, like, bi?

14:54.181 --> 14:56.816
No. No, definitely not.

14:56.817 --> 15:00.386
I mean, I had never done
anything like this before

15:00.387 --> 15:03.890
and I knew afterwards it wasn't for me.

15:03.891 --> 15:07.493
Oh, like... like, how
long after, though?

15:07.494 --> 15:09.228
Like, immediately.

15:09.229 --> 15:11.430
Okay, like, but immediately when?

15:11.431 --> 15:13.466
And, like, was this,
like, a one-time thing

15:13.467 --> 15:15.001
with this, like... this one guy?

15:15.002 --> 15:17.837
Or was it, like, a one-time
thing with other guys or...?

15:17.838 --> 15:21.207
- Molly, one guy, one time.
- Mm-hmm.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.941
That's it.

15:24.511 --> 15:26.712
Okay.

15:26.713 --> 15:29.549
- I have so many questions.
- Shit, me, too!

15:29.550 --> 15:31.884
- Okay, how many times?
- Did he like it?

15:31.885 --> 15:34.220
- Okay, did he come? Did they both come?
- Kelli, that's enough.

15:34.221 --> 15:35.555
Shit, we're all thinking it!

15:35.556 --> 15:38.357
Sweetie, you can't keep dating him.

15:38.358 --> 15:39.690
He's gay.

15:39.715 --> 15:41.060
Because that totally
makes him gay, right?

15:41.061 --> 15:43.172
Bitch, sophomore year, you
hooked up with that chick

15:43.197 --> 15:44.597
who looked like Lisa Turtle.

15:44.598 --> 15:46.132
Okay, who didn't?

15:46.133 --> 15:47.934
- It's different for women.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

15:47.935 --> 15:51.470
You're telling me that once a
dude touches a dick, he's gay?

15:51.471 --> 15:52.528
Yes.

15:52.553 --> 15:54.640
So, it's, like, straight,
straight, straight,

15:54.641 --> 15:57.476
straight, straight,
straight, Lee Daniels?

15:57.477 --> 15:59.879
Yes! It's a double standard.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.347
But, oh, well, that's how it is.

16:01.348 --> 16:03.482
Okay, bitch, so she's
supposed to stop seeing Jared

16:03.483 --> 16:05.051
just because he doesn't subscribe

16:05.052 --> 16:07.119
to the heteronormative
rejection of sexual fluidity?

16:07.120 --> 16:10.223
One women's studies
class and this bitch talk

16:10.224 --> 16:12.258
like she doing the
spoken word in "Flawless."

16:12.259 --> 16:14.160
- I love it.
- I'm just saying

16:14.161 --> 16:16.429
why can't black men
explore their sexuality

16:16.430 --> 16:18.664
without being labeled
gay or bi or whatever?

16:18.665 --> 16:21.167
Because I want my man to be a man.

16:21.168 --> 16:22.902
That's homophobic as fuck, okay?

16:22.903 --> 16:25.238
And if Jared were white, you would
chalk that shit up to the game!

16:25.239 --> 16:27.740
Preach! Why do black
men have to fit in a box

16:27.741 --> 16:29.809
and be super masculine all the time?

16:29.810 --> 16:32.311
I mean, damn! Can't a
nigga get his dick sucked?

16:32.312 --> 16:34.313
Also, can we bring these drinks inside?

16:34.314 --> 16:35.648
No, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

16:35.649 --> 16:37.250
Are you telling me that if you found out

16:37.251 --> 16:39.352
Lawrence got his dick sucked
by some dude way back when,

16:39.353 --> 16:41.854
you would still be talking
all this fluidity shit?

16:41.855 --> 16:45.157
Okay, well, Lawrence
likes to cook, you know,

16:45.158 --> 16:47.727
and he is very particular
about his laundry.

16:47.728 --> 16:49.762
So, you know, besides
having sex with men,

16:49.763 --> 16:51.163
he's kind of the gayest.

16:51.164 --> 16:53.099
- You're so stupid.
- It's true!

16:53.100 --> 16:54.500
Okay, well, Tiffany, what about you?

16:54.501 --> 16:56.535
Like, if you ever found
out that Derek one time...

16:56.536 --> 16:59.538
- He wouldn't.
- I know, but, like, what if one time...

16:59.539 --> 17:01.807
- He wouldn't.
- What, you can't just play along?

17:01.808 --> 17:04.877
No, because he would
never, so that's that.

17:04.877 --> 17:06.839
- You don't know that.
- Wow. Denial!

17:07.905 --> 17:08.909
- He played.

17:08.934 --> 17:10.915
- What's up?
- Oh!

17:10.916 --> 17:14.453
Where y'all two been? What
y'all been doing together?

17:14.454 --> 17:16.489
- Ya-da-da-da.
- Um...

17:16.490 --> 17:18.691
Uh, you guys ready to
see this Jesus play?

17:18.692 --> 17:21.761
They ran out of programs, so
you are gonna have to share.

17:21.762 --> 17:23.796
And they are handing out Kleenex.

17:23.797 --> 17:25.830
The ushers said there will be tears.

17:25.832 --> 17:27.500
Okay, hey.

17:27.501 --> 17:29.302
Y'all better not talk shit

17:29.303 --> 17:30.736
about my cousin's janky-ass play.

17:30.737 --> 17:33.572
Okay? He a hood rat, but we family.

17:33.573 --> 17:35.908
All right? This shit going to Broadway.

17:35.909 --> 17:38.444
- I saw "The First Supper."
- Oh, did you?

17:38.445 --> 17:42.014
Hey. Girl, I know what
Jared said was tough,

17:42.015 --> 17:43.449
but it happened one time.

17:43.450 --> 17:45.618
And he's a good person.

17:45.619 --> 17:49.654
So, if you like him, don't
let that shit ruin it.

17:51.091 --> 17:53.025
I'm gonna try.

17:53.026 --> 17:56.027
- I'm gonna try.
- All right.

18:07.741 --> 18:09.675
That's him. That's my cousin.

18:09.676 --> 18:11.610
- Where?
- I didn't mean to snitch.

18:11.611 --> 18:14.246
I was just trying to teach him a lesson.

18:14.247 --> 18:15.372
Shit!

18:15.442 --> 18:18.017
"Hamilton" this is not.

18:18.018 --> 18:20.553
No shade, but why are
there two intermissions?

18:20.554 --> 18:22.254
One for the bathroom, one for food.

18:22.255 --> 18:24.757
Now, if he was the real son of God,

18:24.758 --> 18:26.559
then he gonna be all right.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.494
Y'all gonna have to
tell me what's going on,

18:28.495 --> 18:30.763
'cause I can't see shit
behind this big-ass hat.

18:30.764 --> 18:33.399
- Shh.
- Oh, hey, sister.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.067
Hi.

18:42.476 --> 18:44.176
Nigga!

18:44.177 --> 18:47.079
Why hast thou forsaken me?

18:47.080 --> 18:49.949
You said you was loyal, but you wasn't.

18:49.950 --> 18:54.920
You said you was faithful,
but you a lying-ass bitch.

18:54.921 --> 18:57.156
My bad, my nigga.

18:57.157 --> 18:58.691
I shouldn't have betrayed you.

18:58.692 --> 19:01.560
I was just tempted, you heard?

19:01.561 --> 19:03.629
You only got yourself to blame.

19:03.630 --> 19:06.664
I can't fucks with you no more.

19:07.467 --> 19:08.801
You can't just bounce!

19:08.802 --> 19:11.237
I'm your day one. You gotta forgive me.

19:11.238 --> 19:15.074
Nigga, you know I love you.

19:15.075 --> 19:17.910
No homo.

19:17.911 --> 19:19.879
But we through.

19:19.880 --> 19:23.281
Jesus out!

19:26.787 --> 19:28.320
- What happened?
- I don't know,

19:28.321 --> 19:30.289
but I know I hate my cousin.

19:30.290 --> 19:32.391
Good job, Tyrell.

19:39.499 --> 19:42.701
I think this place would work
perfect for our fundraiser.

19:42.702 --> 19:44.336
It's huge inside.

19:44.337 --> 19:46.505
Oh, and they provide
candles for ambiance.

19:46.506 --> 19:48.908
It's a no-brainer! Are you tired?

19:48.909 --> 19:51.243
I'm sorry. I just didn't
sleep great last night.

19:51.244 --> 19:53.379
Aw.

19:53.380 --> 19:55.414
- Hey.
- Yo.

19:55.415 --> 19:58.217
I got good news. I got an interview.

19:58.218 --> 19:59.685
Really? Where?

19:59.686 --> 20:02.121
With this tech company in Santa Monica.

20:02.154 --> 20:05.233
Shit, that's amazing!
I'm so happy for you!

20:05.258 --> 20:06.426
Thanks, babe.

20:06.451 --> 20:09.260
I feel like things could finally
be falling in place for us.

20:10.397 --> 20:12.431
Yeah.

20:12.432 --> 20:14.567
Thanks for just being here for me, babe.

20:14.568 --> 20:16.602
Of course. I love you.

20:16.603 --> 20:17.835
Congrats.

20:19.272 --> 20:21.339
Is everything okay?

20:22.809 --> 20:25.444
What the fuck? Excuse me!

20:25.445 --> 20:27.911
Excuse me, we're right
here! Can you please stop?

20:27.936 --> 20:30.161
Sorry. I caught ya.

20:30.186 --> 20:31.517
What? You caught me?

20:31.518 --> 20:33.586
I literally just watched
it go from green to red.

20:33.587 --> 20:37.356
- You can't let it go this one time?
- Once I start writing...

20:37.357 --> 20:39.825
That is a lie. They can
totally stop writing.

20:39.826 --> 20:42.495
Okay, go back to your
shitty-ass, little tricycle

20:42.496 --> 20:44.930
and back to your shitty-ass life,
'cause that's all you've got!

20:44.931 --> 20:47.166
- Yeah!
- You don't even have a real weapon.

20:47.167 --> 20:49.134
All you have is that stupid little box.

20:49.135 --> 20:50.836
And you can't even stop a crime.

20:50.837 --> 20:52.838
All you can do is
write a receipt for it.

20:52.839 --> 20:54.373
Go home to your kids!

20:54.374 --> 20:57.108
Shit!

21:00.280 --> 21:01.814
How'd I let that happen, huh?

21:01.815 --> 21:05.084
What's... I'm so fucking stupid.

21:05.085 --> 21:07.185
What's wrong with me?

21:08.288 --> 21:09.922
Hey, it's not that bad.

21:35.248 --> 21:38.484
Um, can you... can you please stop?

21:38.485 --> 21:40.019
What?

21:40.020 --> 21:42.570
- What?
- I just...

21:43.183 --> 21:44.456
I just can't.

21:44.457 --> 21:48.594
I'm sorry. I just can't
stop thinking about you...

21:48.595 --> 21:50.262
you and that guy.

21:50.263 --> 21:51.662
Me and that guy what?

21:55.435 --> 21:57.435
I'm sorry. I just can't do this.

22:06.336 --> 22:08.314
Damn.

22:08.315 --> 22:09.848
I'm sorry, girl.

22:09.849 --> 22:12.117
I feel so stupid.

22:12.118 --> 22:14.886
I'm tired of this
shit never working out.

22:18.258 --> 22:20.392
Are you sure you can't move past it?

22:20.393 --> 22:21.894
No, I tried.

22:21.895 --> 22:23.062
I thought I could deal with it,

22:23.063 --> 22:26.531
but at this point, it's over.

22:27.567 --> 22:29.802
Fuck! I really liked him.

22:29.803 --> 22:32.071
I mean, why'd he have to tell me?

22:32.072 --> 22:34.572
I'm such a fucking mess.

22:43.883 --> 22:45.950
I fucked Daniel.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.120
Bitch, you did what?

22:52.993 --> 22:55.092
Are you okay?

22:59.065 --> 23:00.665
You gonna do it again?

23:01.868 --> 23:03.334
No.

23:08.575 --> 23:11.276
Then don't tell Lawrence.

23:11.277 --> 23:13.344
Just move on.

23:19.285 --> 23:21.120
My weaknesses?

23:21.121 --> 23:23.455
Well, my major weakness is that
I tend to put a lot of pressure...

23:23.456 --> 23:25.824
sometimes too much pressure...
on myself to succeed,

23:25.825 --> 23:28.259
but I've worked on that.

23:29.663 --> 23:32.564
- What are you doing?
- Going over a few questions.

23:32.565 --> 23:34.500
Just preparing for my interview.

23:34.501 --> 23:36.200
Do I sound dumb?

24:31.191 --> 24:33.224
Damn it, Issa.

24:41.986 --> 24:44.001
