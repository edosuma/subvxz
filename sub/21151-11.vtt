WEBVTT

00:02.190 --> 00:04.240
A sign from above.

00:04.240 --> 00:05.830
A snake in the grass.

00:05.830 --> 00:09.440
And a hex that could
change everything.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.280
It's the summer of temptation.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.080
What were you expecting?

00:14.080 --> 00:17.050
Welcome to Big Brother.

00:20.520 --> 00:24.010
ANNOUNCER: Previously
on Big Brother.

00:24.010 --> 00:27.190
Before shipping off, Cody
planted seeds of doubt

00:27.190 --> 00:28.690
about Mark and Dominique.

00:32.810 --> 00:34.950
Thick as thieves, off
to the side all the time.

00:34.950 --> 00:39.290
ANNOUNCER: With the
marine taking some R&amp;R,

00:39.290 --> 00:42.340
his main squeeze was
the house's new target.

00:42.340 --> 00:43.740
People betrayed us.

00:43.740 --> 00:47.630
If I  a
scheme, I want revenge.

00:47.630 --> 00:50.720
ANNOUNCER: So head of household
Alex planned to put Jess up.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.010
Jessica has me on the block.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.900
We can back-door
someone, that's fine.

00:56.900 --> 00:59.090
But she has to be on the block.

00:59.090 --> 01:01.760
ANNOUNCER: With Alex and
Paul secretly aligned.

01:01.760 --> 01:06.170
We can be teammates, but
play a totally different game.

01:06.170 --> 01:07.070
I want to work with you.

01:07.070 --> 01:09.800
ANNOUNCER: He helped her
zero in on her true target.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.690
Dom and Mark are
definitely up to something.

01:11.690 --> 01:13.840
Dominique obviously showed
she's a good competitor.

01:13.840 --> 01:14.990
Dom is smart.

01:14.990 --> 01:17.120
I would rather target
Dom first before Mark,

01:17.120 --> 01:18.680
because honestly
I think Dominique

01:18.680 --> 01:22.580
is more of a competitor and
more of a threat in this game.

01:22.580 --> 01:25.310
ANNOUNCER: After the gamer
revealed her nominations--

01:25.310 --> 01:27.980
I nominate you, Jessica,
and you, Dominique.

01:27.980 --> 01:30.630
ANNOUNCER: Dominique
suspected a Benedict Arnold.

01:30.630 --> 01:32.480
I knew something was up.

01:32.480 --> 01:34.310
Although Alex put
me up on the block,

01:34.310 --> 01:37.070
I have a feeling some people
on my side knew about it.

01:37.070 --> 01:38.780
And I'm going to get
to the bottom of it,

01:38.780 --> 01:39.680
you can bet on it.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.200
ANNOUNCER: So she called
upon a higher power.

01:46.260 --> 01:48.380
I'm in the restroom praying--

01:48.380 --> 01:50.510
ANNOUNCER: And her
prayers were answered.

01:50.510 --> 01:54.090
All of a sudden, I hear
Paul's name three times.

01:56.390 --> 01:58.610
ANNOUNCER: Inside the
temple of temptation,

01:58.610 --> 02:01.340
Whoa.

02:01.340 --> 02:03.530
ANNOUNCER: Whistle-Nut
walked away with power.

02:03.530 --> 02:05.210
Congratulations, Jason.

02:05.210 --> 02:10.010
You have won the
golden power of veto.

02:10.010 --> 02:11.750
ANNOUNCER: With her
back against the wall,

02:11.750 --> 02:14.320
Dominique attempted to out Paul.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.930
I know who the snake is.

02:23.090 --> 02:25.410
ANNOUNCER: But when Alex
snitched to the snake--

02:25.410 --> 02:27.120
So I found out
who the snake is.

02:27.120 --> 02:27.890
Who's the snake?

02:27.890 --> 02:30.860
Let's hear it.

02:30.860 --> 02:31.560
Me?

02:31.560 --> 02:33.320
ANNOUNCER: His fangs came out.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.560
Unless you want
me to start sliding

02:34.560 --> 02:38.400
over there and hissing at you,
we could have a conversation.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.890
Paul, let's do it.

02:39.890 --> 02:42.160
ANNOUNCER: And a war
of words erupted.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.440
You're going home, though.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.430
I guarantee you that.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.740
Real smug coming from the
person who is on the block

02:46.740 --> 02:48.410
right now.

02:48.410 --> 02:52.040
ANNOUNCER: At the veto meeting,
Dominique threw some shade.

02:52.040 --> 02:56.540
If you were to stand in my
shoes and witness the behavior

02:56.540 --> 02:59.870
of Paul and Elena
post-nom's then

02:59.870 --> 03:02.210
you would totally understand
where I am coming from.

03:02.210 --> 03:04.100
If I use the power
of veto on you,

03:04.100 --> 03:05.570
what do you think
the outcome would be?

03:05.570 --> 03:08.090
I will not be willing
to work with my team,

03:08.090 --> 03:11.550
because they clearly
stabbed me in the back.

03:11.550 --> 03:14.250
ANNOUNCER: And it seemed
Dom's fate was sealed.

03:14.250 --> 03:17.660
I have decided not to
use the power of veto.

03:17.660 --> 03:20.280
ANNOUNCER: Tonight will
it be Jessica or Dominique

03:20.280 --> 03:21.690
evicted from the house?

03:21.690 --> 03:25.050
Or will the halting hex
change the course of the game?

03:25.050 --> 03:28.770
Plus, a simple game of
pool ignites an epic fight.

03:28.770 --> 03:30.320
I'm a man of my word.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.320
Did you beat me that game?
- Yes.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.570
OK.

03:33.570 --> 03:36.470
ANNOUNCER: All this
live on Big Brother.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.470
Good evening.

04:23.470 --> 04:24.970
I'm Julie Chen.

04:24.970 --> 04:26.860
Welcome to Big Brother.

04:26.860 --> 04:30.220
It's been another explosive
week in the Big Brother house

04:30.220 --> 04:34.850
as blindsides and betrayals
continue to rock this game.

04:34.850 --> 04:37.780
And while old alliances
have fallen apart,

04:37.780 --> 04:41.320
new, secret allies have
emerged, keeping everyone

04:41.320 --> 04:44.200
doubting whom they can trust.

04:44.200 --> 04:48.160
But the greatest secret of
all just might be the contents

04:48.160 --> 04:51.040
of the final den of temptation.

04:51.040 --> 04:55.420
A power that could stop
tonight's live eviction cold.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.940
So who received the halting hex?

04:57.940 --> 04:59.860
And will it be used tonight?

04:59.860 --> 05:01.850
We'll find out soon enough.

05:01.850 --> 05:05.890
But first, with the eviction
looming and tensions high,

05:05.890 --> 05:08.080
harsh words aren't
the only things being

05:08.080 --> 05:09.730
thrown around in the house.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.920
This meeting is adjourned.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.380
I didn't use
the power of veto.

05:19.380 --> 05:21.290
Jessica and Dom are
still on the block.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.930
There's been a lot of talk
and banter, whether to use it,

05:28.930 --> 05:31.360
whether not to use it, back
and forth, back and forth.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.850
But I've made my
decision, and hopefully

05:33.850 --> 05:35.380
Dominique is going home.

05:50.110 --> 05:51.870
Thank you.

05:51.870 --> 05:53.670
Very funny, Paul.

05:53.670 --> 05:56.700
Dominique, it looks like you
just made my job a lot easier.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.280
I just had to solidify why
you were a threat to people

05:59.280 --> 06:01.530
in the house, but I think
you're making that very

06:01.530 --> 06:03.100
clear all on your own.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.550
Yeah, Jess, I think
the agenda is clear.

06:05.550 --> 06:09.210
I am going to remain on the
block, but Dominique blowing up

06:09.210 --> 06:12.120
is making my situation
a lot easier.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.320
Oh my god.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.400
My focus right
now is to repair

06:15.400 --> 06:18.030
some of the relationships
that were damaged last week.

06:18.030 --> 06:19.480
I'm not ready to go home.

06:19.480 --> 06:23.620
It's never a dull ceremony.

06:23.620 --> 06:25.030
I don't deal very
well with people

06:25.030 --> 06:27.700
who stab me in the back
and smile in my face

06:27.700 --> 06:28.960
like nothing happened.

06:28.960 --> 06:32.170
My entire team backstabbed me.

06:32.170 --> 06:35.540
They are willing to go to
any extreme to win $500K.

06:40.450 --> 06:42.570
I'm not willing to do that,
but apparently they are.

06:46.470 --> 06:49.410
It's all good.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.350
I hope you protect yourself,
because if they did it to me,

06:51.350 --> 06:52.610
they'll do it to you.

07:00.940 --> 07:02.100
- Mm.

07:02.100 --> 07:02.870
Oh, god.

07:02.870 --> 07:04.760
She keeps saying she wants
to wait until she can watch

07:04.760 --> 07:07.040
the episodes back and like-- why
don't you really wait and see.

07:07.040 --> 07:07.770
She can watch them--

07:07.770 --> 07:09.500
Yeah, on Friday you
can watch it all back,

07:09.500 --> 07:11.500
and see that I never
did anything wrong.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.870
Enjoy your last couple
of days in the house.

07:13.870 --> 07:16.960
Elena, if you want to have a
conversation with me, you can.

07:16.960 --> 07:17.780
No, I'm good.

07:17.780 --> 07:18.580
I just decided I'm good.

07:18.580 --> 07:19.280
You can.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.960
No one walked up to me
and had a conversation

07:20.960 --> 07:22.490
with me, so if you want to
have a conversation with me--

07:22.490 --> 07:23.490
No, I just decided I'm good.

07:23.490 --> 07:25.150
--I've been around this
house the entire time.

07:25.150 --> 07:26.120
So if anybody--
- No, I just decided I'm good.

07:26.120 --> 07:26.990
--wants to say
anything to me--

07:26.990 --> 07:29.300
- I just, I'm good.
- The door is open.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.310
Has anybody walked up to
me in the last two days

07:31.310 --> 07:33.110
to have a conversation with me?
- I have.

07:33.110 --> 07:34.820
I was talking to Elena.

07:34.820 --> 07:39.150
You said anybody
and I raised my hand.

07:39.150 --> 07:40.770
Yeah, I got to like
twist it if you think

07:40.770 --> 07:41.690
you're gonna come after me.

07:47.450 --> 07:48.450
What just happened in there?

07:48.450 --> 07:49.730
Was it a girl fight?

07:49.730 --> 07:52.600
Oh, Dominique came for me,
and I didn't do anything.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.200
I just said over and over
again, "No, thank you,

07:54.200 --> 07:55.060
I don't want to talk."

07:55.060 --> 08:00.770
I'll let her get evicted,
go home, watch Big Brother,

08:00.770 --> 08:02.830
and see that I
did nothing wrong.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.140
That's the best.

08:04.140 --> 08:07.010
Dominique's on the block,
and this erratic speech

08:07.010 --> 08:08.620
isn't doing her any favors.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.620
I'm guessing it's a
last-ditch effort.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.500
And I'm still confused
what she thinks

08:12.500 --> 08:15.290
I did to her, because I've
literally done nothing.

08:15.290 --> 08:16.920
I don't have to defend myself.

08:16.920 --> 08:20.510
I refuse to feel guilt when
I have no guilt to feel.

08:20.510 --> 08:23.010
It kills me that Dominique
is still on the block,

08:23.010 --> 08:24.500
but she's putting
me in a very tough

08:24.500 --> 08:27.080
situation with all
the allegations

08:27.080 --> 08:29.600
about Elena and Paul.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.320
I just feel very,
like, in the middle.

08:31.320 --> 08:35.080
But this is a game, and Elena's
my closest ally right now.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.460
And we're working with
another strong couple.

08:37.460 --> 08:39.650
I have to side with
Elena on this one.

08:39.650 --> 08:41.000
As long as
everybody in his house

08:41.000 --> 08:44.010
understands that I was
wrongly implicated by her,

08:44.010 --> 08:44.710
then I'm Gucci.

08:51.150 --> 08:53.190
So I want to talk
to both of you,

08:53.190 --> 08:57.050
and legitimately ask
for help at this point.

08:57.050 --> 09:00.530
Because I don't want to
leave the game right now.

09:00.530 --> 09:03.350
Losing Cody sucked.

09:03.350 --> 09:04.780
Everything we went
through sucked.

09:04.780 --> 09:05.480
Yeah.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.670
Honestly, I think all
of it was just a mistake,

09:07.670 --> 09:08.840
and I wish I could
have avoided it.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.460
And--
- Well, you couldn't have.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.380
It wasn't you.

09:12.380 --> 09:17.360
Now that Cody's gone, Jessica
is coming crawling back to us

09:17.360 --> 09:19.340
to get back in our good graces.

09:19.340 --> 09:20.750
I don't trust the girl.

09:20.750 --> 09:21.690
My best advice to you--

09:21.690 --> 09:22.890
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

09:22.890 --> 09:24.610
Keep doing what you're doing.

09:24.610 --> 09:27.110
This week, Dom's going home.

09:27.110 --> 09:29.130
I'm telling Jessica
what she wants to hear.

09:29.130 --> 09:31.040
Dominique is a
priority this week,

09:31.040 --> 09:33.360
but Jessica is
totally on my radar,

09:33.360 --> 09:35.240
and I see straight
through that girl.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.880
- Just don't engage in anything.
- Yeah.

09:45.220 --> 09:47.190
All right, so you break.

09:47.190 --> 09:50.080
- Ready, break.
- OK.

09:50.080 --> 09:53.920
So loser chugs that full
thing of pickle juice and half

09:53.920 --> 09:55.320
of the cup of hot sauce.

09:55.320 --> 09:58.220
One gulp, no nose.

09:58.220 --> 09:59.620
- Deal.
- Let's go.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.880
So one thing that all
the guys doing this house

10:03.880 --> 10:05.450
is we all play pool.

10:05.450 --> 10:06.660
Don't choke, buddy.

10:06.660 --> 10:07.660
This is going to be awesome.

10:07.660 --> 10:09.710
Half pickle juice,
half hot sauce.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.330
It's a good way for
us just to hang out,

10:11.330 --> 10:13.070
you know, kick it with
the guys and just chill.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.500
And it's not game-related,
it's just having fun.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.970
Nice and easy.

10:16.970 --> 10:19.350
Why so aggressive, meatball?

10:19.350 --> 10:20.140
15 corner.

10:23.740 --> 10:25.330
And he chokes.

10:25.330 --> 10:26.940
10 corner.

10:26.940 --> 10:29.900
Dup, dup, duh, da-dup dup.

10:34.830 --> 10:35.890
No!

10:35.890 --> 10:37.160
That's a scratch!

10:37.160 --> 10:38.960
You just double-hit the ball.
- Redo it.

10:38.960 --> 10:39.540
- You double-hit the ball.
- Redo it.

10:39.540 --> 10:40.510
How do you redo that?

10:40.510 --> 10:41.710
Redo it.

10:41.710 --> 10:42.880
You just scratched
on the 8-ball.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.410
- You scratched on the 8, buddy.
- Redo it.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.410
You just scratched
on the 8-ball.

10:46.410 --> 10:48.100
- Redo it.

10:48.100 --> 10:48.670
Redo it.

10:48.670 --> 10:49.840
You just scratched
on the 8-ball.

10:49.840 --> 10:50.960
I won that game.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.090
You double-hit.

10:56.270 --> 10:59.210
I think given the stakes here,
that was a blatant double-hit.

10:59.210 --> 11:00.620
Eat your
pickle juice, fool.

11:00.620 --> 11:02.020
Get the  out of here.

11:02.020 --> 11:03.810
Waa, waa, waa.

11:03.810 --> 11:05.730
Eat your pickle juice
and your hot sauce,

11:05.730 --> 11:06.670
and then we'll re-bet.

11:06.670 --> 11:09.160
You do that 100 times and
nobody calls you out on it.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.560
You want to back out of
the bet that you made--

11:11.560 --> 11:13.400
The best way to
describe Josh--

11:13.400 --> 11:14.770
If you want to
rerack, we'll rerack it.

11:14.770 --> 11:15.790
You did not win that game.

11:15.790 --> 11:17.020
I just won that game.

11:17.020 --> 11:17.770
How?

11:17.770 --> 11:19.000
He's just like a little kid.

11:21.850 --> 11:25.240
Good sportsmanship, I like it.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.190
He did not win.

11:26.190 --> 11:29.420
But he kept running his mouth.

11:29.420 --> 11:31.340
Josh, I just want to
lighten things up right now.

11:31.340 --> 11:33.040
So let me just cool
you off a little bit.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.570
I'm a man of my word.

11:34.570 --> 11:35.640
Did you beat me that game?

11:35.640 --> 11:36.340
Yes.

11:46.820 --> 11:48.490
I gave you a chance.

11:48.490 --> 11:51.580
You can't beat me when
you scratch on the 8-ball.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.120
So you just throw--
OK.

12:00.820 --> 12:03.210
He didn't beat me.

12:03.210 --> 12:05.760
I agree that he
didn't beat you.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.570
I don't agree that that
was a good idea, however.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.570
Oh, get away
from me right now.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.070
Hug it out!

12:20.070 --> 12:21.550
Hug it out!

12:21.550 --> 12:23.690
I have hot sauce-- no, I
have hot sauce in my eye

12:23.690 --> 12:25.680
and in my nose.
That's  up.

12:25.680 --> 12:26.790
You should've drank it.

12:26.790 --> 12:27.970
No, I'm not playing with you.

12:27.970 --> 12:30.430
You just threw
ketchup and mayo.

12:30.430 --> 12:31.980
You just put this all over me.

12:31.980 --> 12:33.420
Get the  out of my face.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.120
I'm not playing.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.030
You  threw
hot sauce in my eye.

12:36.030 --> 12:36.800
You didn't beat me!

12:36.800 --> 12:37.650
Walk the  back.

12:37.650 --> 12:38.910
Why are you getting
so upset, Josh?

12:38.910 --> 12:40.310
- You're a coward.
- Look at this.

12:40.310 --> 12:42.960
That's why I don't talk to
you, because you can't take it.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.160
So if it's a fair
game, let it be a game,

12:45.160 --> 12:47.020
but don't cross
the  line.

12:47.020 --> 12:48.030
OK, OK, OK.

12:48.030 --> 12:49.730
It's good.
- You're done.

12:49.730 --> 12:50.940
You're done.

12:50.940 --> 12:51.890
You broke your word.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.220
So you still think
you won the game.

13:11.900 --> 13:12.630
Stop.

13:12.630 --> 13:13.920
You could have
reasoned with me.

13:16.730 --> 13:18.010
You fool, you
always

13:18.010 --> 13:21.620
Mark,  said stop.

13:21.620 --> 13:23.010
Guys, let's have
a good time, man.

13:23.010 --> 13:26.200
I didn't come 3,500 miles to
watch you two guys argue, man.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.390
You go there with me, you
don't got  on me.

13:33.510 --> 13:34.410
He's a sore loser.

13:37.310 --> 13:40.100
I had a lot of respect for
that kid, and a lot of love.

13:40.100 --> 13:42.440
It's all fun and games, but
now when you start throwing out

13:42.440 --> 13:44.300
that I'm a liar,
and that I cheat,

13:44.300 --> 13:46.640
and that I go back on my word,
and I don't stick to my bets,

13:46.640 --> 13:48.500
and there's people
around us, now

13:48.500 --> 13:50.090
you're attacking my character.

13:50.090 --> 13:53.000
So to be honest, Mark, I wasn't
going to go there with you,

13:53.000 --> 13:53.900
but let's go there.

13:58.450 --> 14:01.300
Up next, it started
with throwing condiments,

14:01.300 --> 14:04.330
but this fight is far from over.

14:04.330 --> 14:07.070
Then, it's the live
vote and eviction.

14:07.070 --> 14:09.860
But the final den
of temptation could

14:09.860 --> 14:11.860
throw the night for a loop.

14:11.860 --> 14:13.170
Stay with us.

14:32.470 --> 14:33.990
Welcome back to Big Brother.

14:33.990 --> 14:37.240
In the wake of Mark
and Josh's silly fight,

14:37.240 --> 14:43.200
things take a serious turn that
could affect tonight's fiction.

14:43.200 --> 14:43.900
What's wrong?

14:51.120 --> 14:54.820
Josh, I am sorry, because
the hot sauce in the eyes--

14:54.820 --> 14:55.940
I feel bad about that.

14:55.940 --> 14:57.430
I don't want to hurt
you, and putting hot--

14:57.430 --> 14:58.360
It's not about hurting me.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.100
It's about you disrespecting me.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.350
I have no respect
for you at all.

15:02.350 --> 15:03.870
OK, that's fine, Josh.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.370
Now let's talk about how you
say you're a man of your word,

15:06.370 --> 15:07.720
and you're loyal,
yet you were plotting

15:07.720 --> 15:09.640
against Paul to get him out.

15:09.640 --> 15:10.930
I was plotting
to get rid of Paul?

15:10.930 --> 15:11.630
No, no, no, no.

15:11.630 --> 15:13.990
Let's talk about your
loyalty and your word as a man.

15:13.990 --> 15:15.910
Let's do that.

15:15.910 --> 15:17.500
Let's do that, Mark.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.810
Don't ever bring up my word.

15:18.810 --> 15:21.170
Why don't you tell Paul
since he's right here.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.730
Let's talk about it.

15:22.730 --> 15:24.240
Let's talk about it.
- Scratch it, dude.

15:24.240 --> 15:24.940
No.

15:24.940 --> 15:27.250
Last time I checked, I wasn't
plotting against nobody

15:27.250 --> 15:28.630
that I gave my word
to in this house,

15:28.630 --> 15:30.380
or that I was working with.

15:30.380 --> 15:32.760
So you want to go
there, we can go there.

15:32.760 --> 15:33.700
Now it's game on.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.040
Now it's like I'm not even
talking behind closed doors.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.180
Let's talk in
front of everybody.

15:37.180 --> 15:38.860
You got something to
talk, you want to air

15:38.860 --> 15:40.510
something, let's do it, baby.

15:40.510 --> 15:41.500
It's game on.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.930
I gave you my notes
on respect, but guess

15:42.930 --> 15:44.860
what, you made it personal,
and I'm going to make it game.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.660
I got balls, and if I don't
like you, I don't like you.

15:46.660 --> 15:47.810
And that's how I'm
going to say it.

15:47.810 --> 15:49.240
And if I want to get you,
I'm going to say, Paul,

15:49.240 --> 15:50.210
I want you out of this house.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.720
What are you
nodding your head at?

15:54.720 --> 15:56.400
He's not directly
saying that to me.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.230
First off, why are
you even talking to me?

15:58.230 --> 16:00.060
Because I have the right
to talk to you if I want to.

16:08.890 --> 16:11.660
All I'm gonna say is, from
here on out, don't talk to me,

16:11.660 --> 16:13.610
don't address me,
don't look at me.

16:13.610 --> 16:15.730
That's fair.

16:15.730 --> 16:17.900
- I lost all respect for you.
- OK.

16:21.050 --> 16:22.860
I had so much love
and respect for you.

16:22.860 --> 16:23.930
Stop.
No you don't.

16:23.930 --> 16:25.130
You said you had no
respect for me, Josh.

16:25.130 --> 16:25.830
No, no, no, no, no.

16:25.830 --> 16:27.650
You  it up.
Don't do it.

16:27.650 --> 16:29.820
You  it up when you
threw a drink in my face.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.970
You made it personal
when you started

16:31.970 --> 16:33.170
questioning my word as a man.

16:33.170 --> 16:36.170
That for me, that's an attack
as a man and as a person.

16:36.170 --> 16:37.780
If I told you that
I'm loyal to you,

16:37.780 --> 16:39.650
and I'm giving you my
word, don't question it.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.490
And I can say, looking
you dead in your eyes,

16:41.490 --> 16:43.470
that I don't know if I could
say the same thing about you.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.150
That's it.
That's all I got to say.

16:45.150 --> 16:46.520
How did I break my word?

16:46.520 --> 16:48.200
Your name has been
brought up, that you

16:48.200 --> 16:50.930
were plotting against Christmas
and Paul to get them out.

16:50.930 --> 16:52.100
Yes, Cody said
that to everybody.

16:52.100 --> 16:52.240
OK.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.930
And you're in alliance,
and you were loyal to them.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.810
So don't question my words and
my bets and all this stuff.

16:56.810 --> 17:00.020
And now, got grab your
people, and go try to spin it

17:00.020 --> 17:00.830
your way, buddy.

17:00.830 --> 17:02.060
Because guess what?

17:02.060 --> 17:04.730
Name one person in this room,
that I've given you my word.

17:04.730 --> 17:06.940
And ask that person if they
had to come and campaign

17:06.940 --> 17:09.090
or say something to me, I said,
there goes my word, buddy.

17:09.090 --> 17:10.550
You don't got to
tell me nothing else.

17:10.550 --> 17:12.400
I'm solid.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.530
Does anybody else
have something to say?

17:14.530 --> 17:16.240
Because I got all day.

17:19.890 --> 17:21.680
So what did you say
upstairs in the HOH room

17:21.680 --> 17:22.620
about Christmas?

17:22.620 --> 17:23.880
What did you say, Josh?

17:23.880 --> 17:25.650
Remind me, and I'll clarify
if I said it, because I

17:25.650 --> 17:26.550
don't have nothing to hide.

17:26.550 --> 17:28.300
Do you want to tell
everybody what you said?

17:28.300 --> 17:29.130
No, no.
You go ahead.

17:29.130 --> 17:30.430
What did I say?
Because I really don't remember.

17:30.430 --> 17:30.820
Go ahead.

17:30.820 --> 17:32.270
You didn't say
anything about Christmas?

17:32.270 --> 17:33.410
What did I say
about Christmas?

17:33.410 --> 17:35.520
You didn't say that you
wanted her out of the house?

17:35.520 --> 17:37.290
Yeah, I lied to
your ass instead of--

17:38.040 --> 17:39.210
--Because I don't
owe you

17:39.210 --> 17:40.740
You lied to me.

17:40.740 --> 17:44.020
So your word now mean's nothing.

17:44.020 --> 17:45.150
You did lie to me.

17:45.150 --> 17:47.670
Forgive me, because
I'm a compulsive liar.

17:47.670 --> 17:50.100
Oh my god, Josh.

17:50.100 --> 17:52.720
Jessica, if you're trying
to be under the radar,

17:52.720 --> 17:54.510
you're definitely
not under the radar.

17:54.510 --> 17:56.670
You are above the radar,
next to the radar,

17:56.670 --> 17:57.960
you might just be the radar.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.510
And you arguing right
now is only making

18:00.510 --> 18:01.890
you a little bit shadier.

18:01.890 --> 18:04.330
You rallied against one girl
that was supposedly your team,

18:04.330 --> 18:06.000
and now you want to come
in and reinsert yourself.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.490
And you do it, but
don't come for me.

18:07.490 --> 18:10.250
Oh my god.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.260
Jessica is antagonizing
Josh right now,

18:12.260 --> 18:14.100
and that could work in my favor.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.600
We're both on the
block this week--

18:15.600 --> 18:17.520
go ahead and paint a
bigger target on your back.

18:17.520 --> 18:20.520
You turned on us on the flip,
because Cody convinced you.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.880
And now that Cody's gone you
want to reinsert yourself.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.150
Boo Boo, it's not a
good look for you.

18:24.150 --> 18:27.230
Don't call me Boo
Boo, sweetheart.

18:27.230 --> 18:28.520
Your boop-boop's off.

18:28.520 --> 18:30.600
Josh, leave me
the  alone.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.680
Like, honestly.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.120
I'm sitting on
the block this week,

18:33.120 --> 18:35.790
so I'm not in the best
position to call out Josh.

18:35.790 --> 18:39.000
But at the same time, I honestly
couldn't stand by and listen

18:39.000 --> 18:40.890
to Josh, tell any more lies.

18:40.890 --> 18:44.540
And I'm just hoping this
doesn't blow up in my face.

18:44.540 --> 18:47.310
Oh my god.

18:47.310 --> 18:50.540
You got something to say?
All right.

18:55.130 --> 18:57.880
Up next, the final
den of temptation

18:57.880 --> 19:01.240
plays out, and could stop
tonight's live eviction

19:01.240 --> 19:02.770
dead in its tracks.

19:02.770 --> 19:05.410
Who will receive
this temptation?

19:05.410 --> 19:06.770
Find out next.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.720
Stay with us.

19:28.770 --> 19:30.760
Welcome back to Big Brother.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.910
Tonight, the den of
temptation comes to an end,

19:33.910 --> 19:37.430
but its effects could
last for weeks to come.

19:37.430 --> 19:42.280
So whom did you, America, vote
to receive the halting hex?

19:51.240 --> 19:54.910
ANNOUNCER: House guests,
it's time to return

19:54.910 --> 19:57.580
to the den of temptation.

20:05.340 --> 20:08.430
America has been voting
all week to tempt a new guest

20:08.430 --> 20:10.920
inside the den of temptation.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.900
One at a time, we
will re-enter the den,

20:12.900 --> 20:16.390
where we will be told in secret
if we are being tempted or not.

20:16.390 --> 20:18.390
And remember, if the
temptation is accepted,

20:18.390 --> 20:21.410
it will unleash a
consequence on the house.

20:21.410 --> 20:23.070
As you were told,
the den of temptation

20:23.070 --> 20:25.020
is only open for
three weeks, so this

20:25.020 --> 20:26.640
will be your final trip inside.

20:26.640 --> 20:27.470
Good luck.

20:32.130 --> 20:34.060
Behind the back.
It's a layup.

20:34.060 --> 20:38.470
ANNOUNCER: Jason, you
may now enter the den.

20:38.470 --> 20:40.650
Come on, America.

20:40.650 --> 20:42.790
OK, den of temptation.

20:42.790 --> 20:43.940
Third time's a charm.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.480
I don't see any snakes
or voodoo dolls,

20:51.480 --> 20:53.330
so I'm feeling
like this cowboy's

20:53.330 --> 20:54.850
bad luck is about over.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.850
Come on, America,
give me something.

21:01.850 --> 21:06.610
"Sorry, America has chosen
not to tempt you this week."

21:06.610 --> 21:09.020
Come on, America.

21:09.020 --> 21:10.880
"Sorry, America has chosen--"

21:10.880 --> 21:12.200
"--not to tempt
you this week."

21:12.200 --> 21:13.130
"Sorry--"

21:13.130 --> 21:14.890
Oh my god, America.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.490
I really hope
America has given

21:19.490 --> 21:21.590
me this temptation,
because I've been

21:21.590 --> 21:23.430
backstabbed by my own team.

21:25.940 --> 21:28.280
This temptation
could possibly be

21:28.280 --> 21:29.930
my saving grace in this game.

21:32.870 --> 21:37.490
"Sorry, America has chosen
not to tempt you this week."

21:37.490 --> 21:39.490
"Since you already
received a temptation,

21:39.490 --> 21:42.550
you are not eligible
to receive another."

21:42.550 --> 21:45.710
"Sorry, America has chosen
not to tempt you this week."

21:45.710 --> 21:47.110
Thanks again for nothing.

22:00.170 --> 22:01.740
"Congratulations, Jessica.

22:01.740 --> 22:04.320
America has chosen to tempt
you with the halting hex.

22:06.970 --> 22:08.920
Accept this temptation,
and the halting hex

22:08.920 --> 22:11.890
will allow you to halt any one
of the next four evictions.

22:11.890 --> 22:15.910
If you or any ally is
in danger of going home,

22:15.910 --> 22:18.760
you have the power to
stop the live eviction

22:18.760 --> 22:21.790
by unleashing the halting
hex before the voting

22:21.790 --> 22:23.010
process begins."

22:23.010 --> 22:25.030
Oh my god.

22:25.030 --> 22:27.450
"You may use the hex at
any one of the next four

22:27.450 --> 22:29.860
live evictions, but it
may only be used once.

22:29.860 --> 22:31.630
Then it is gone forever.

22:31.630 --> 22:34.590
But remember, every temptation
comes with a consequence.

22:34.590 --> 22:37.900
And while the halting hex could
change the course of your game,

22:37.900 --> 22:40.090
accepting it will change
the course of the entire Big

22:40.090 --> 22:41.340
Brother game."

22:41.340 --> 22:45.730
America, thank you,
and I 100% accept.

22:45.730 --> 22:47.740
I need this more than
anything right now.

22:47.740 --> 22:49.370
Ever since Cody
left the house,

22:49.370 --> 22:51.880
I feel like there is no one in
this house that I can lean on.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.920
So it's really comforting to
know that America has my back.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.230
And I'm holding onto that.

22:56.230 --> 22:57.740
So thank you, America.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.670
This is so cool.

23:06.700 --> 23:09.050
"The gravest position
is on the block,

23:09.050 --> 23:11.260
but there is a way
to halt the clock.

23:11.260 --> 23:13.730
Save the spell and
you will hex it.

23:13.730 --> 23:16.550
On eviction night,
there will be no exit.

23:16.550 --> 23:18.860
Repeat these words three times.

23:18.860 --> 23:22.040
Halting hex rise,
eviction night dies.

23:22.040 --> 23:25.160
Halting hex rise,
eviction night dies.

23:25.160 --> 23:28.580
Halting hex rise,
eviction night dies."

23:39.140 --> 23:43.020
"Sorry, America has chosen
not to tempt you this week."

23:43.020 --> 23:46.930
"Sorry, America has chosen
not to attempt you this week."

23:46.930 --> 23:49.480
"Sorry, America has chosen
not to tempt you this week."

23:49.480 --> 23:50.730
I'm good, America.
Appreciate it.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.080
I've been cursed.

23:59.500 --> 24:00.820
I realize that
there's going to be

24:00.820 --> 24:03.250
a really big consequence
unleashed on the house,

24:03.250 --> 24:04.300
but I don't care.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.190
I don't owe anybody in
this house anything.

24:11.480 --> 24:16.560
ANNOUNCER: The temptation inside
the den has been accepted,

24:16.560 --> 24:22.320
and this consequence will
affect the entire house.

24:22.320 --> 24:28.230
You will learn more in due time.

24:28.230 --> 24:29.080
Ha ha ha.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.200
Ha ha ha ha.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.360
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

24:33.360 --> 24:35.580
Calm down.

24:35.580 --> 24:39.060
The temptation works for
this eviction plus three more.

24:39.060 --> 24:42.030
The eviction
seems like it could

24:42.030 --> 24:44.820
be signed, sealed, and
delivered in my favor,

24:44.820 --> 24:46.750
but anything could happen.

24:46.750 --> 24:47.720
This is a big decision.

24:50.610 --> 24:54.120
So Jessica has
accepted the halting hex.

24:54.120 --> 24:58.080
But will she use it to
halt tonight's eviction?

24:58.080 --> 25:00.630
If she does, it would
guarantee her safety,

25:00.630 --> 25:03.690
but could set the
house into a tailspin.

25:03.690 --> 25:05.410
Stay with us.

25:27.730 --> 25:29.250
Welcome back to Big Brother.

25:29.250 --> 25:31.560
It's now time for the
live vote and eviction.

25:31.560 --> 25:34.260
Jessica and Dominique
are on the block,

25:34.260 --> 25:36.840
but no one knows that
Jessica, thanks to you,

25:36.840 --> 25:39.600
America, holds the halting hex.

25:39.600 --> 25:43.170
She can use it at one of
the next four evictions,

25:43.170 --> 25:44.550
starting tonight.

25:44.550 --> 25:47.130
The question is, with
Josh putting her back

25:47.130 --> 25:48.990
in the line of
fire, will Jessica

25:48.990 --> 25:51.750
use it to guarantee
her safety tonight,

25:51.750 --> 25:54.960
or will she roll the dice,
thinking that Dominique is

25:54.960 --> 25:57.270
more on the outs than she is?

25:57.270 --> 26:00.320
Let's head to the living
room and find out.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.880
JULIE CHEN: Hello, house guests.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.430
Well everyone, it's now time
for the live vote and eviction.

26:06.430 --> 26:09.100
Jessica, Dominique,
in just moments,

26:09.100 --> 26:12.430
your housemates will cast
their votes to evict live.

26:12.430 --> 26:14.530
But before they
do, you each have

26:14.530 --> 26:18.100
a final chance to sway their
votes with one brief statement.

26:18.100 --> 26:21.640
Jessica, you're first.

26:21.640 --> 26:24.040
Firstly, mom, if
you're watching, hi.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.230
I miss you every day.

26:25.230 --> 26:28.890
And Cody, if you're watching,
this is hard without you.

26:28.890 --> 26:31.200
And everybody, I'm not
ready to leave yet.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.360
So I really hope you
keep me, because I've

26:33.360 --> 26:36.800
got some game left in me.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.650
JULIE CHEN: Thank you, Jess.
Dominique.

26:41.470 --> 26:44.020
It's never easy to
witness a false fact.

26:44.020 --> 26:46.700
It's never easy to
dribble the ball back.

26:46.700 --> 26:49.210
So I dribble to scribble
through all that,

26:49.210 --> 26:52.420
dunking hope against hope I
call this, this very moment.

26:52.420 --> 26:54.880
I came into this house
as a woman of integrity,

26:54.880 --> 26:57.190
and I will leave this house
as a woman of integrity.

26:57.190 --> 26:58.960
I think most people know
deep down in their hearts

26:58.960 --> 27:01.300
that I do not deserve
to be evicted tonight.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.490
However-- I mean, my
own team betrayed me.

27:03.490 --> 27:05.950
However, if that
becomes my reality,

27:05.950 --> 27:07.150
I want to say thank you to God.

27:07.150 --> 27:08.680
I love you, Jesus.

27:08.680 --> 27:11.200
And I want to say thank you to
CBS and the Big Brother family.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.860
This has been an
incredible experience.

27:12.860 --> 27:15.550
I am beyond grateful.

27:15.550 --> 27:18.760
If I have offended, wronged,
or wrongfully accused

27:18.760 --> 27:22.210
anyone in any way, I'm sorry,
and I ask for your forgiveness.

27:22.210 --> 27:23.920
For those of you
out there listening,

27:23.920 --> 27:26.440
no matter who turns
their back on you,

27:26.440 --> 27:28.870
you rise up in
strength, you persevere,

27:28.870 --> 27:32.510
you stay true to who you are,
and you hold onto your faith.

27:32.510 --> 27:33.580
I love you all.

27:33.580 --> 27:36.970
Have a great summer.

27:36.970 --> 27:38.380
JULIE CHEN: Thank you, Dom.
All right.

27:38.380 --> 27:39.080
Thank you both.

27:39.080 --> 27:42.070
It's now time for the
live voting to begin.

27:42.070 --> 27:44.950
The two nominees are
not allowed to vote.

27:44.950 --> 27:46.900
Alex, as current
head of household,

27:46.900 --> 27:49.450
you will only vote in
the event of a tie.

27:49.450 --> 27:52.300
One at a time, the rest of
you will enter the diary room

27:52.300 --> 27:55.000
and cast your vote to evict.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.530
Josh, you're up first.

27:56.530 --> 27:57.610
Please go the diary room.

28:04.030 --> 28:07.480
So Jessica has not
invoked the halting

28:07.480 --> 28:12.310
hex, even though Josh tried
to put a target on her back.

28:12.310 --> 28:13.060
Hello, Josh.

28:13.060 --> 28:13.810
Hey, Julie.

28:13.810 --> 28:15.460
Please cast your
vote to evict.

28:15.460 --> 28:18.150
I sadly vote to
evict Dominique.

28:18.150 --> 28:19.750
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

28:22.130 --> 28:24.100
Week after week,
Kevin has lobbed

28:24.100 --> 28:26.660
secret vote after secret vote.

28:26.660 --> 28:30.210
What does he have in
store for us tonight?

28:30.210 --> 28:31.360
- Hi, Kevin.
- Hi, Julie.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.100
How are you doing tonight?
- I'm very well, thank you.

28:33.100 --> 28:34.550
Please cast your vote to evict.

28:34.550 --> 28:36.910
I vote to evict Dominique.

28:36.910 --> 28:37.610
Thank you.

28:37.610 --> 28:38.880
All right, Julie,
have a good night.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.350
Mark shed tears for
Dominique this week.

28:44.350 --> 28:46.660
Will he vote to protect
his friend tonight?

28:49.980 --> 28:51.400
- Hello, Mark.
- Hey, Julie.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.810
Please cast your
vote to evict.

28:52.810 --> 28:55.180
- I vote to evict Dominique.
- Thank you.

28:55.180 --> 28:55.880
Yep.

28:58.450 --> 29:01.450
Christmas has gone
toe to toe with Jessica,

29:01.450 --> 29:05.230
but we've seen her ally
Paul gunning for Dominique.

29:05.230 --> 29:06.170
What will she do?

29:12.330 --> 29:13.860
- Hello, Christmas.
- Hi, Julie.

29:13.860 --> 29:15.410
Please cast your
vote to evict.

29:15.410 --> 29:18.500
I unfortunately vote
to evict Dominique.

29:18.500 --> 29:19.630
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

29:25.330 --> 29:28.930
Jason has been hoping to
recruit Jessica as an ally,

29:28.930 --> 29:30.840
but is that still his plan?

29:33.950 --> 29:34.760
Hi, Jason.

29:34.760 --> 29:35.650
Hi, Julie.

29:35.650 --> 29:37.180
Please cast your
vote to evict.

29:37.180 --> 29:39.570
- I vote to evict Dominique.
- Thank you.

29:39.570 --> 29:40.270
Thank you.

29:43.270 --> 29:47.380
Raven has said she doesn't
trust Jessica or Dominique.

29:47.380 --> 29:50.360
Where will her vote fall?

29:50.360 --> 29:51.300
Hi, Raven.

29:51.300 --> 29:52.120
Hey, Julie.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.600
Please cast your
vote to evict.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.540
- I vote to evict Dominique.
- Thank you.

29:56.540 --> 29:57.240
Thank you.

30:00.410 --> 30:04.250
It's official, with six votes
to evict Dominique, Dominique

30:04.250 --> 30:05.480
will leave the house tonight.

30:05.480 --> 30:09.180
But let's see how
the other votes fall.

30:09.180 --> 30:10.720
- Hi, Matt.
- What's up, Julie.

30:10.720 --> 30:11.980
Please cast your
vote to evict.

30:11.980 --> 30:14.890
I sadly vote to
evict Dominique.

30:14.890 --> 30:16.320
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Julie.

30:18.890 --> 30:22.030
Dominique called Elena
out in her veto speech.

30:22.030 --> 30:23.920
Will Elena vote her
out of the house?

30:27.550 --> 30:29.520
- Hello, Elena.
- Hey, girl.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.230
Please cast her vote to evict.

30:31.230 --> 30:33.840
- I vote to evict Dominique.
- Thank you.

30:33.840 --> 30:34.540
You're welcome.

30:37.890 --> 30:42.530
Paul orchestrated a charge
to rid the house of Dominique.

30:42.530 --> 30:46.040
But has he had a
change of heart?

30:46.040 --> 30:47.540
Hi, Paul.
- Hi, Julie.

30:47.540 --> 30:48.920
Please cast your
vote to evict.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.560
I vote to evict Dominique.

30:50.560 --> 30:51.260
Thank you.

30:51.260 --> 30:51.960
Thank you.

30:54.230 --> 30:56.740
After surviving
the block last week,

30:56.740 --> 30:59.000
Ramses has been lying low.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.020
So what's in his best interest?
- Hi, Ramses.

31:03.020 --> 31:03.980
Hey, Julie.

31:03.980 --> 31:05.390
Please cast your
vote to evict.

31:05.390 --> 31:08.460
I cast to vote
to evict Dominique.

31:08.460 --> 31:09.500
- Thank you.
- Bye.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.200
Love you, mom!

31:20.370 --> 31:21.780
All of the votes are in.

31:21.780 --> 31:24.710
Let's give the news
to the house guests.

31:24.710 --> 31:27.180
House guests, the votes are in.

31:27.180 --> 31:29.190
When I reveal the vote,
the evicted house guest

31:29.190 --> 31:31.110
will have just a
few moments to say

31:31.110 --> 31:35.670
goodbye, gather her belongings,
and walk out the front door.

31:35.670 --> 31:41.550
By a vote of 10-0,
Dominique, you are evicted

31:41.550 --> 31:42.450
from the Big Brother house.

32:10.020 --> 32:10.980
God bless you all.

32:10.980 --> 32:12.380
Make sure you take
care of yourself.

32:12.380 --> 32:13.250
I love you, girl.

32:13.250 --> 32:14.720
- Bye, DD, bye.
- Bye.

32:14.720 --> 32:17.990
- I love you, Dom.

32:17.990 --> 32:18.790
Love you, too.

32:18.790 --> 32:20.760
Love you, Dom.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.230
Love you, baby.

32:42.970 --> 32:46.190
Aw, that happened so fast.

32:46.190 --> 32:47.140
OK, hold on.

32:47.140 --> 32:47.910
I'm wearing my glasses.

32:47.910 --> 32:49.570
We got good chances.

32:49.570 --> 32:52.090
Josh, your hair is everywhere.

32:52.090 --> 32:53.600
Jesus.
Jesus!

32:53.600 --> 32:54.400
Absolutely everywhere.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.770
This is disgusting.

32:59.420 --> 33:03.650
What did Paul whisper in
your ear as you were leaving?

33:03.650 --> 33:07.310
Philosophy outside of the house.

33:07.310 --> 33:08.180
What did he say?

33:08.180 --> 33:09.370
- That's what he said.

33:09.370 --> 33:10.070
That's it.

33:10.070 --> 33:12.320
Philosophy out--
what does that mean?

33:12.320 --> 33:15.290
So he likes to have
philosophy talks.

33:15.290 --> 33:16.670
So he's saying he
wants to be friends

33:16.670 --> 33:17.870
with you outside of the house?

33:17.870 --> 33:20.120
Yeah, and I'm going to
be honest with you, Julie.

33:20.120 --> 33:22.350
You know, so I love God a lot.

33:22.350 --> 33:23.050
Right?

33:23.050 --> 33:26.000
And sometimes the human side
takes over, and I'm like,

33:26.000 --> 33:27.500
I don't know if I can
be friends with someone

33:27.500 --> 33:28.820
who did what they did.

33:28.820 --> 33:30.570
So I'm going to pray on it.

33:30.570 --> 33:32.090
Well, let's talk
about that, because you

33:32.090 --> 33:34.310
were convinced he betrayed you.
- Yes.

33:34.310 --> 33:37.040
Why were you convinced
he betrayed you?

33:37.040 --> 33:38.880
Things weren't adding up.

33:38.880 --> 33:39.980
And so we'll see.

33:39.980 --> 33:41.250
I'm like, I hope I'm not wrong.

33:41.250 --> 33:42.680
But if I'm wrong, that's
one of the reasons

33:42.680 --> 33:44.480
why I apologized in advance.

33:44.480 --> 33:47.270
Because I'm like, I can own up
to the possibility of me being

33:47.270 --> 33:50.480
wrong, but just based on
his behavior the day prior

33:50.480 --> 33:52.120
and the day of,
things doesn't add up.

33:52.120 --> 33:52.820
And I'm like--

33:52.820 --> 33:54.930
And what about Elena,
because you called her out.

33:54.930 --> 33:55.650
Why?
- I did.

33:55.650 --> 33:58.340
And so I was hoping that
Elena would come talk to me.

33:58.340 --> 34:01.880
So people were afraid to talk
to me after all this happened.

34:01.880 --> 34:04.100
With Elena, I was
just expecting her--

34:04.100 --> 34:07.340
she was making comments
prior to nom's that were

34:07.340 --> 34:08.360
red flags for me, and I'm--

34:08.360 --> 34:09.900
Like what?

34:09.900 --> 34:11.300
"So you should
probably go talk to her."

34:11.300 --> 34:12.650
She said it twice.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.000
And then another
thing that she said

34:14.000 --> 34:16.610
was, "Hey, I don't want to
have blood on my hands."

34:16.610 --> 34:19.580
Well if we're a team, and
this is what we're agreeing

34:19.580 --> 34:22.300
to do as it relates to getting
Jessica out of the house,

34:22.300 --> 34:24.380
then why would you have
blood on your hands.

34:24.380 --> 34:25.730
So I was just--

34:25.730 --> 34:26.900
Let me ask you this.

34:26.900 --> 34:29.480
If you got the chance
to do it all over again,

34:29.480 --> 34:31.910
is there anything you
would do differently?

34:31.910 --> 34:32.800
Oh, most definitely.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.570
- Be quiet.

34:36.710 --> 34:39.770
Oh my gosh, and I'm
such an open book,

34:39.770 --> 34:44.120
and I have the mandate to come
in the house and be Dominique.

34:44.120 --> 34:46.340
And so, in being Dominique,
sometimes Dominique

34:46.340 --> 34:48.200
just likes to share everything.

34:48.200 --> 34:50.930
And in this house
you can't do that.

34:50.930 --> 34:53.840
It's important to just wait
things out to see if what

34:53.840 --> 34:56.260
you are perceiving is true.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.640
Well I have some
good news for you.

34:58.640 --> 35:02.660
You might get that chance
to be quiet in the house.

35:02.660 --> 35:04.010
They're not ready.

35:04.010 --> 35:05.840
They are not ready.

35:05.840 --> 35:10.440
There is a twist in the
game that you and everyone

35:10.440 --> 35:14.930
in the house is unaware of,
and this twist will give one

35:14.930 --> 35:17.690
of the first four
evictees a chance to get

35:17.690 --> 35:19.790
back in the house,
and another crack

35:19.790 --> 35:21.460
at that half-million dollars.
- Oh my gosh.

35:21.460 --> 35:22.220
That'll feel good.

35:22.220 --> 35:25.640
It's called the
Battle Back Showdown.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.170
How does that sound to you?

35:27.170 --> 35:28.310
Amazing.

35:28.310 --> 35:29.150
Amazing.

35:29.150 --> 35:31.010
I got a lot of
shots, and I'm ready.

35:31.010 --> 35:31.910
I am so ready.

35:31.910 --> 35:33.080
Well stick around,
because I want

35:33.080 --> 35:35.750
to talk with you and
the first three evictees

35:35.750 --> 35:36.980
in just a moment.

35:36.980 --> 35:38.090
This is so cool.

35:38.090 --> 35:39.890
Stay right there.

35:39.890 --> 35:43.250
Up next, Cameron, Jillian,
Cody, and Dominique

35:43.250 --> 35:45.620
join me live to talk
all about the game

35:45.620 --> 35:48.380
and what their plans are
should they make it back

35:48.380 --> 35:49.340
into the Big Brother house.

35:49.340 --> 35:51.110
Stay with us.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.350
Welcome back to Big Brother.

36:10.350 --> 36:12.780
They were the first to
leave the Big Brother house,

36:12.780 --> 36:14.730
but they will soon
be given a chance

36:14.730 --> 36:16.590
to battle back in the game.

36:16.590 --> 36:18.630
First, say hello to Cameron.

36:24.240 --> 36:26.010
Julie!

36:26.010 --> 36:27.710
Cameron.

36:27.710 --> 36:29.280
You were evicted on
night number one.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.000
I know, don't remind me.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.340
Who would you guess
followed in your footsteps

36:34.340 --> 36:35.970
and was the next evicted?

36:35.970 --> 36:37.030
- Ramses.

36:37.030 --> 36:37.730
All right.

36:37.730 --> 36:38.630
Let's see if you're right.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.390
Evictee number two, come on out.

36:40.390 --> 36:41.370
Come on out.

36:47.150 --> 36:48.390
JULIE CHEN: Have a seat, please.

36:48.390 --> 36:49.220
What's up, Jillian?

36:49.220 --> 36:49.950
JULIE CHEN: All right.

36:49.950 --> 36:50.670
So you are wrong.

36:50.670 --> 36:52.290
Are you surprised to
see it was Jillian?

36:52.290 --> 36:53.850
Yes, I am surprised.
JULIE CHEN: Why?

36:53.850 --> 36:55.620
I thought Jillian
was like, you know,

36:55.620 --> 36:56.490
really liked in the house.

36:56.490 --> 36:58.650
That's why she stayed
there longer than I was.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.710
So yeah.
I'm surprised.

37:00.710 --> 37:01.740
JULIE CHEN: All right, Jillian.

37:01.740 --> 37:04.150
Who do you think followed
in your footsteps?

37:04.150 --> 37:06.080
Jessica or Cody.

37:06.080 --> 37:08.030
JULIE CHEN: Let's see,
evictee number three.

37:08.030 --> 37:09.360
Is it Jessica or Cody?

37:14.850 --> 37:16.850
JULIE CHEN: How?

37:16.850 --> 37:18.870
How did you guess him?

37:18.870 --> 37:19.570
I don't know.

37:19.570 --> 37:23.910
I just knew I was betrayed, and
I figured it was going down.

37:23.910 --> 37:25.110
I did not-- I have no idea.

37:25.110 --> 37:25.840
JULIE CHEN: All right.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.350
I'm sorry I put you
up in the first place.

37:27.350 --> 37:29.170
No it's OK.
It's fine.

37:29.170 --> 37:31.270
JULIE CHEN: Cody, who do you
think was the next evictee?

37:31.270 --> 37:32.110
Tonight's evictee?

37:32.110 --> 37:33.540
I hope not Jessica.

37:33.540 --> 37:34.570
JULIE CHEN: So anyone but Jess?

37:34.570 --> 37:35.530
Anyone but Jess.

37:35.530 --> 37:36.610
JULIE CHEN: All right.

37:36.610 --> 37:37.950
Number four evictee.

37:44.700 --> 37:46.200
No way.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.790
Oh my god.

37:47.790 --> 37:50.940
JULIE CHEN: Now, as
the four of you know--

37:50.940 --> 37:55.050
chatting later, Cody, you'll
find out details later.

37:55.050 --> 37:57.690
Now, as you all know, one
of you will get the chance

37:57.690 --> 38:00.300
to battle back into the house.

38:00.300 --> 38:02.760
But first, I want to talk about
your experience in the house.

38:02.760 --> 38:04.760
Cameron, you were only
in there a few hours.

38:04.760 --> 38:05.460
I know.

38:05.460 --> 38:07.440
JULIE CHEN: Was there
a moment that you

38:07.440 --> 38:10.020
knew your fate was sealed?

38:10.020 --> 38:12.870
I knew my fate was sealed
when I'm doing stripteases

38:12.870 --> 38:13.730
to try and get votes.

38:16.340 --> 38:17.970
JULIE CHEN: Yeah.
Times are tough.

38:17.970 --> 38:19.950
I know.
JULIE CHEN: But you tried.

38:19.950 --> 38:22.110
Julie, what would you
say was your greatest

38:22.110 --> 38:24.030
mistake in this game?

38:24.030 --> 38:26.340
Letting someone else
tell you that they're

38:26.340 --> 38:29.790
going to help you get the votes,
totally believing that person,

38:29.790 --> 38:31.920
and then they backstab you.

38:31.920 --> 38:35.780
So I should've took things
into my own hands a lot more.

38:35.780 --> 38:36.480
JULIE CHEN: Cody.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.210
You look shocked to be
sitting next to Dominique.

38:38.210 --> 38:40.420
Very.
JULIE CHEN: Why?

38:40.420 --> 38:43.400
I thought we were all--

38:43.400 --> 38:44.330
I don't know.

38:44.330 --> 38:47.580
Everything blew up,
you know, when I was--

38:47.580 --> 38:49.650
the week after HOH
and everything.

38:49.650 --> 38:52.090
And I'm just surprised that
they didn't stick with Dom.

38:52.090 --> 38:54.010
And I don't know, I'm
just kind of shocked.

38:54.010 --> 38:56.110
I have no idea what happened.

38:56.110 --> 38:57.500
Wow.

38:57.500 --> 39:00.090
And if that happened to
Dom, then who knows who's

39:00.090 --> 39:02.340
safe in the house now?

39:02.340 --> 39:04.390
JULIE CHEN: That's Big Brother.

39:04.390 --> 39:06.660
Dominique, you and
I just talked game.

39:06.660 --> 39:07.980
So I'm going to
ask you, how do you

39:07.980 --> 39:12.300
think you will do in the
battle back against these three

39:12.300 --> 39:13.140
individuals?

39:13.140 --> 39:15.780
Oh my gosh, I'm
going to be nice,

39:15.780 --> 39:17.680
and say I'm going to
do exceptionally well,

39:17.680 --> 39:19.770
and I hope to win.

39:19.770 --> 39:20.970
Hoping that we all do well.

39:20.970 --> 39:24.810
I think we have a little
bit more ammo, so--

39:24.810 --> 39:25.830
JULIE CHEN: We'll see.

39:25.830 --> 39:27.360
Cameron, if you get back
in what are you going

39:27.360 --> 39:28.780
to do differently this time?

39:28.780 --> 39:32.190
Well I'm going to try to
stay in a little bit longer.

39:32.190 --> 39:33.420
JULIE CHEN: Work
on your striptease.

39:33.420 --> 39:34.530
How's that?

39:34.530 --> 39:35.260
Yeah.

39:35.260 --> 39:36.960
JULIE CHEN: Jillian,
if you get back in,

39:36.960 --> 39:39.780
who would you align
with in the game?

39:39.780 --> 39:41.820
At this point, I'm
thinking I'm going to try

39:41.820 --> 39:45.720
and go for Elena or Raven.

39:45.720 --> 39:47.460
That's what I'm
thinking at this point.

39:47.460 --> 39:50.370
JULIE CHEN: Cody,
if you get back in,

39:50.370 --> 39:52.610
are you or are you not
going to play a social game?

39:52.610 --> 39:53.310
Or--

39:53.310 --> 39:55.040
It's such a target-rich
environment for me,

39:55.040 --> 39:56.170
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

39:56.170 --> 39:57.570
I'll probably just
listen to Jess,

39:57.570 --> 39:59.560
or else she's just going to
punch me if I don't listen.

39:59.560 --> 40:00.440
I don't know.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.510
We'll have to see what she says.

40:02.510 --> 40:03.240
JULIE CHEN: All right.

40:03.240 --> 40:07.140
Well, as you all know, last
summer, the first four evictees

40:07.140 --> 40:10.830
competed against each other, and
one of them worked their way,

40:10.830 --> 40:12.750
battled their way,
back into the game.

40:12.750 --> 40:15.470
Well, we like to shake
things up around here.

40:15.470 --> 40:18.690
So that's not exactly
how it's going to be.

40:18.690 --> 40:19.390
All right.

40:19.390 --> 40:21.540
JULIE CHEN: You're going to
find out how we shook things

40:21.540 --> 40:25.690
up when it's the right time.

40:25.690 --> 40:28.350
Until then, are you guys
pumped for this yes?

40:28.350 --> 40:29.120
Yes.

40:29.120 --> 40:29.850
JULIE CHEN: All right.

40:29.850 --> 40:31.230
Well good luck, everybody.
- All right.

40:31.230 --> 40:31.930
Thank you, Julie.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.350
JULIE CHEN: Stay
right there So how

40:34.350 --> 40:37.440
will the fate of Cameron,
Jillian, Cody, and Dominique

40:37.440 --> 40:38.340
play out?

40:38.340 --> 40:39.560
Stay with us.

40:56.490 --> 41:02.630
Welcome
back to Big Brother.

41:02.630 --> 41:05.180
Tune in tomorrow night
at 8:00/7:00 central

41:05.180 --> 41:07.370
for the Battle Back Showdown.

41:07.370 --> 41:09.350
Three epic battles
will determine

41:09.350 --> 41:12.170
the fate of the first
four evicted house guests.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.420
Will one of them
return to the game?

41:14.420 --> 41:16.880
Then Sunday, the head
of household competition

41:16.880 --> 41:17.750
plays out.

41:17.750 --> 41:21.710
Who will rise to power, and who
will be nominated for eviction?

41:21.710 --> 41:24.470
Then on Wednesday, the
veto is back up for grabs.

41:24.470 --> 41:26.330
Will the nominations change?

41:26.330 --> 41:29.360
And next Thursday,
if Jessica still

41:29.360 --> 41:32.450
doesn't use the halting
hex, another house guest

41:32.450 --> 41:33.560
will be evicted.

41:33.560 --> 41:36.800
But because Jessica
accepted the hex,

41:36.800 --> 41:39.710
she has unleashed a new
consequence that will

41:39.710 --> 41:42.830
change the game for everyone.

41:42.830 --> 41:46.750
Find out what this
consequence is next Thursday.
