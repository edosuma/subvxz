WEBVTT

00:07.709 --> 00:08.875
Hey, Rudy, what are you watching?

00:09.083 --> 00:10.083
"What Did You Do?"

00:10.166 --> 00:11.625
Oh, we worked out, got a cheeseburger,

00:11.709 --> 00:13.750
and then came in here
and asked you what you were watching.

00:13.834 --> 00:14.875
What are you watching?

00:15.375 --> 00:16.500
"What Did You Do?"

00:16.583 --> 00:18.500
Dude, I told you, we got a cheeseburger,

00:18.583 --> 00:20.000
- we worked out--
- No!

00:20.083 --> 00:21.917
It's the name of my favorite TV show.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.750
They use hidden cameras and actors
to capture real people doing good deeds.

00:25.834 --> 00:26.834
Oh.

00:27.250 --> 00:29.709
<i>Excuse me sir, I'm Don Quinonas,</i>

00:29.792 --> 00:32.542
<i>host of "What Did You Do?"</i>

00:32.625 --> 00:36.166
<i>My hidden cameras just captured you
doing something remarkable.</i>

00:36.250 --> 00:39.625
- <i>you gave $500...</i>
-

00:39.959 --> 00:41.834
<i>...to a complete stranger...</i>

00:43.375 --> 00:46.709
<i>...so he could get
his cat's broken tail fixed.</i>

00:46.792 --> 00:48.917
Look, he's...

00:49.375 --> 00:50.458
Oh, god.

00:50.542 --> 00:52.375
Oh. I gotta be on this show...

00:52.875 --> 00:55.250
so people will know
that I'm better than they are.

00:56.667 --> 00:57.792
And humble.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.208
So humble.

01:01.542 --> 01:02.709
Oh, hey.

01:02.792 --> 01:04.625
How's your volunteer job
at the history museum going?

01:04.709 --> 01:06.625
Oh, I love it. I'm working right now.

01:06.709 --> 01:09.166
-
<i>Gather round, good townspeople.</i>

01:09.542 --> 01:10.750
Those are the Living Legends.

01:10.834 --> 01:13.417
They're traveling actors
doing a show at the museum.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.959
Their motto is,
"We make history come to life."

01:17.291 --> 01:20.667
Oh, five bucks say
they make Jerry fall asleep!

01:22.250 --> 01:23.291
Come on.

01:26.041 --> 01:27.041
Jerry...

01:27.125 --> 01:31.166
meet Ben Franklin, Albert Einstein,
Cleopatra, and Attila the Hun.

01:31.458 --> 01:34.417
Hun? Pretty sure Attila's a dude.

01:35.625 --> 01:39.250
Early to bed, early to rise,
makes a man healthy, wealthy,

01:39.291 --> 01:40.750
and wise.

01:40.834 --> 01:43.083
Early to bed, early to rise,

01:43.166 --> 01:45.667
go hit a treadmill and lay off the fries.

01:46.792 --> 01:50.250
In my day,
the young respected their elders.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.583
Yeah, well in my day,

01:51.667 --> 01:54.333
dudes didn't wear
their sister's stockings.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.709
- I'm gonna get--
- Keep it together, Carl,

01:57.792 --> 01:59.250
keep it together.

02:00.417 --> 02:01.917
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:02.000 --> 02:07.709
gather round and witness how I discovered
that lightning is electricity.

02:09.417 --> 02:10.917
I'll need a volunteer.

02:11.667 --> 02:13.041
Oh, uh...

02:13.125 --> 02:14.208
You!

02:18.542 --> 02:20.917
Huh! He never uses volunteers.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.208
I was flying my kite on a stormy night,

02:23.291 --> 02:24.875
- when suddenly...
-

02:33.291 --> 02:34.333
Is...

02:34.834 --> 02:36.291
Is that how he got you?

02:39.875 --> 02:43.041
<i>♪ Don't you get all tough with me ♪</i>

02:43.125 --> 02:47.208

03:18.959 --> 03:20.291
Okay, would you rather

03:20.375 --> 03:23.417
be a Neanderthal
facing a saber-toothed tiger,

03:23.500 --> 03:26.709
or a peasant facing the Bubonic plague?

03:26.792 --> 03:29.291
Oh, that is a good one.

03:29.333 --> 03:32.166
Ugh, whichever kills me quicker.

03:32.834 --> 03:34.291
Man, you nerds need to get a life.

03:34.709 --> 03:36.291
History is Important, Jerry.

03:36.375 --> 03:37.875
It's why we volunteer at the museum.

03:37.959 --> 03:39.583
I still can't believe
you guys don't get paid.

03:39.667 --> 03:41.792
Whoa, we get paid...

03:42.125 --> 03:43.583
in knowledge!

03:43.834 --> 03:45.750
Whoo-hoo!

03:45.834 --> 03:48.375
We're making deposits
in the brain bank, yo.

03:48.458 --> 03:50.250
- Yeah!
Cha-ching!

03:50.333 --> 03:52.125
Oh, wow. Okay.

03:54.417 --> 03:56.291
Guys, Chloe's here.
Quick, nerd breath check.

03:58.917 --> 04:00.041
Oh, one of us has stink mouth,

04:00.125 --> 04:01.542
- I think it's me.
- No, I think it's me.

04:01.625 --> 04:02.458
Hey, guys.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.041
Teddy's got stink mouth!

04:06.000 --> 04:07.709
Milton, we changed the schedule.

04:07.792 --> 04:10.583
You'll be working with me
in the samurai wing tomorrow.

04:10.625 --> 04:11.709
Oh...

04:13.041 --> 04:14.959
Oh, Jerry, this is Chloe. She's our--

04:15.041 --> 04:19.917
Robot. All right, you guys
finally perfected the robo-girlfriend.

04:21.542 --> 04:22.959
Oh, great job.

04:23.166 --> 04:24.792
It's a big improvement
over the floor waxer

04:24.875 --> 04:26.834
Sydney put a bra on and called Sophia.

04:27.667 --> 04:28.709
I miss Sophia.

04:31.458 --> 04:32.792
Can I borrow her for the prom?

04:33.917 --> 04:35.208
Ah! She's so realistic.

04:35.291 --> 04:36.542
I'm not going to prom with you.

04:36.625 --> 04:38.041
Very realistic.

04:39.333 --> 04:43.166
Jerry, Chloe is the head
of our volunteer program at the museum.

04:43.333 --> 04:45.583
And like me, she loves history.

04:45.875 --> 04:46.959
Oh, really?

04:47.250 --> 04:49.583
Well, uh, what it do, girl?

04:49.667 --> 04:51.166
And what year did it do it in?

05:00.917 --> 05:03.709
Hey, not on my wharf, tough guys.

05:03.792 --> 05:05.000
Get outta here.

05:05.625 --> 05:06.834
And tell your friends...

05:07.041 --> 05:09.834
when Rudy's on duty,
they better watch their booty.

05:12.041 --> 05:13.417
Okay, don't tell them that. Just go.

05:15.000 --> 05:15.959
Hey.

05:16.959 --> 05:18.250
I think you're safe now, pal.

05:19.041 --> 05:21.417
Just know that this only happened
because wearing this...

05:22.166 --> 05:23.375
dorky backpack.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.583
I mean, who wears
a tickly turtle backpack?

05:25.667 --> 05:27.208
You look like a little dork boy.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.709
Uh, excuse me. Uh...

05:35.041 --> 05:36.250
Ma'am, you dropped this.

05:36.333 --> 05:41.709
Excuse me, I'm Don Quinonas
from the TV show "What Did You Do?"

05:41.792 --> 05:43.208
That's my favorite show.

05:43.750 --> 05:45.750
This woman is an actress.

05:45.834 --> 05:49.750
And our hidden camera
just caught you giving her wallet back.

05:49.834 --> 05:51.291
<i>It's really no big deal.</i>

05:51.417 --> 05:53.208
<i>Yeah, you heard him.</i>

05:53.583 --> 05:54.625
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

05:54.709 --> 05:56.458
<i>Uh, did your camera catch me
helping the dork boy?</i>

05:56.542 --> 05:58.500
<i>Because that was a big deal.</i>

05:59.417 --> 06:01.750
Excuse me, sir,
we're talking to a real hero.

06:03.709 --> 06:07.417
<i>It's not every day we meet someone
with your kind heart.</i>

06:07.542 --> 06:08.625
<i>I'm a hero!</i>

06:08.834 --> 06:10.375
<i>A hero with a huge heart!</i>

06:11.625 --> 06:12.959
Tell 'em, dork boy.

06:13.041 --> 06:14.125
Tell 'em I'm a hero!

06:14.709 --> 06:16.208
I'm a hero!

06:22.250 --> 06:24.208
Do you wanna hear a samurai haiku?

06:24.291 --> 06:27.125
Oh, 17 beautiful syllables
that say it all.

06:27.208 --> 06:29.208
As long as it's not about love.

06:29.709 --> 06:33.458
Every guy volunteer recites one to me
hoping that I'll go out with them.

06:33.750 --> 06:34.709
What's yours?

06:39.333 --> 06:42.375
Samurais have swords.

06:44.458 --> 06:47.500
Sharp, sharp, sharp,
sharp, sharp, sharp swords.

06:48.667 --> 06:49.709
This is the end.

06:50.083 --> 06:51.083
Swords.

06:52.667 --> 06:53.792
Hey, Chloe.

06:53.875 --> 06:56.125
Just stopped by to pick up
a volunteer application

06:56.208 --> 06:57.500
for the samurai wing.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.709
Jerry, you don't know anything
about samurais.

07:01.083 --> 07:03.000
Oh, really? Try me.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.834
Fact battle!

07:07.792 --> 07:10.125
Just, uh... cleaning the statues.

07:10.208 --> 07:11.875
Definitely not following Chloe around.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.417
That'd be creepy, right?

07:15.667 --> 07:18.500
I will not lower myself
to engage in a silly competition

07:18.583 --> 07:19.709
with this buffoon.

07:19.792 --> 07:23.208
I think intellectual competitions
are so manly.

07:23.291 --> 07:24.583
Let's battle, baby!

07:26.291 --> 07:28.500
I love fact battles.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.750
What is the name of the defense garment
worn on the back of a--

07:31.834 --> 07:33.375
-
- What is a <i>horo</i> ?

07:33.500 --> 07:36.041
It was invented by Hatakeyama Masanaga

07:36.125 --> 07:37.375
during the Onin war.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.083
Huh! Boo-yah!

07:40.709 --> 07:43.333
What's buried in Shogun Hashindo's tomb?

07:43.375 --> 07:44.875
-
- A golden sword.

07:44.959 --> 07:47.291
Oh! Ba-bam! Yeah.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.750
Ah! Hold on, now. I'm not done facting.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.125
Legend has it
that if the sword is removed,

07:54.208 --> 07:56.959
his royal guards
will come back to life to protect him.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.208
Nobody believes that gold sword stuff.

08:00.291 --> 08:01.750
Legends are dumb.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.959
Aren't you guys the Living Legends?

08:04.291 --> 08:05.917
Aren't you supposed to be
cleaning a statue

08:06.000 --> 08:08.208
and not creeping on Chloe?

08:09.583 --> 08:11.000
Touché, Mr. Franklin.

08:11.250 --> 08:12.375
Touché.

08:14.625 --> 08:17.583
Jerry, i misjudged you.

08:17.667 --> 08:20.709
You'll be working with me
as tour guide of this wing.

08:21.208 --> 08:23.500
Milton, you'll be with the Living Legends.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.834
Jerry, since when do you know things?

08:31.917 --> 08:33.667
I mean, I still tie your shoes.

08:34.125 --> 08:37.041
Well, when it comes
to getting a cute girl, I'll do anything.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.458
Even study history.

08:38.875 --> 08:40.667
Oh, that reminds me.

08:40.834 --> 08:42.709
Tie it yourself, Jerry.

08:42.792 --> 08:44.375
What? Fine.

08:44.875 --> 08:45.959
I don't need your help.

08:47.375 --> 08:48.709
I can tie my own shoe.

08:52.166 --> 08:54.208
There, done.

08:58.041 --> 08:59.333
Told you i could do it!

09:05.166 --> 09:07.583
There you are.

09:09.291 --> 09:11.750
You little glory stealer.

09:12.208 --> 09:13.041
Yeah, oh, okay.

09:13.125 --> 09:15.083
So I picked up that wallet
so I could be on TV.

09:15.166 --> 09:17.291
So you admit it!

09:19.291 --> 09:22.083
Well, now it's my turn to be on TV.

09:22.417 --> 09:25.125
I hired an actress online
to play an old woman with a walker.

09:25.208 --> 09:27.166
She will struggle across the courtyard

09:27.250 --> 09:30.500
and I will heroically swoop in
and carry her to her destination.

09:30.583 --> 09:33.166
How do you know that Don Quinonas
and his crew are even still here?

09:33.500 --> 09:35.208
Let's just say a little birdie told me...

09:35.667 --> 09:37.542
to let all the air out of their tires.

09:39.875 --> 09:41.500
Oh, that must be her.

09:45.917 --> 09:46.875
Oh, no.

09:47.083 --> 09:50.375
This frail but sweet lady
appears to need help.

09:50.458 --> 09:54.041
I, Rudy Gillespie,
selfless, single sensei,

09:54.125 --> 09:56.125
will gladly help this wobbly walker.

09:57.041 --> 09:59.083
Hey, beat it, pal, she's mine.

10:00.959 --> 10:02.041
Allow me to assist.

10:03.583 --> 10:04.625
Get in my arms.

10:05.291 --> 10:07.166
I said, get in my arms. Come here.

10:07.250 --> 10:08.959
Ow. Ow. Hey.

10:10.959 --> 10:13.166
Listen, you old biddy,
I'm trying to pick you up.

10:13.542 --> 10:15.125
- Come here! Come here!
-

10:21.417 --> 10:24.458
I'd like to say my show
brings out the best in people,

10:24.667 --> 10:27.583
<i>but today, our cameras caught
the most heinous act</i>

10:27.709 --> 10:29.875
<i>of human cruelty ever.</i>

10:30.333 --> 10:31.125
<i>Huh?</i>

10:33.792 --> 10:34.750
<i>And... cut.</i>

10:34.834 --> 10:36.667
That was great. We'll air it tonight.

10:36.750 --> 10:39.750
No, Don, this is a misunderstanding.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.208
I'm looking for Rudy Gillespie.

10:43.291 --> 10:45.917
The guy that hired a stunt granny
so he could look good on TV.

10:46.000 --> 10:46.875
You're late!

10:46.959 --> 10:48.500
You made me look like a monster!

10:58.667 --> 11:01.041
Hey, what are you guys laughing about?

11:01.125 --> 11:02.834
Something Jerry said.

11:02.917 --> 11:05.333
You had to be there.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.333
But i wasn't.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.083
Face it, Milton, she's not into you.

11:13.917 --> 11:15.083
She's into me.

11:15.583 --> 11:17.125
Oh, and I love hanging out with her.

11:17.208 --> 11:19.291
She's smart, she loves museums,

11:19.583 --> 11:21.750
oh, and she's got
the cutest little freckles.

11:22.875 --> 11:24.667
She's like a version of you I can kiss.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.291
- Oh, kiss this!
-

11:27.917 --> 11:28.834
Oh...

11:30.542 --> 11:31.917
What did you two do?

11:32.000 --> 11:35.125
That caveman skeleton is 75,000 years old.

11:35.208 --> 11:36.667
Oh! What a relief.

11:36.750 --> 11:38.083
At least we didn't break a new one.

11:39.750 --> 11:40.792
This is his fault.

11:40.875 --> 11:43.417
He's pretending to care about history
to get close to you.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.458
What?

11:45.417 --> 11:46.792
At least I'm man enough to ask her out.

11:46.875 --> 11:48.417
Oh, you don't think I'm man enough?

11:48.542 --> 11:49.917
I'll ask her out right now.

11:53.750 --> 11:55.417
Samurais have swords.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.041
- Sharp, sharp, sharp...
- That's it!

11:57.125 --> 11:58.625
Both of you should leave.

11:58.959 --> 12:01.709
I'm gonna be here all night
trying to get this hand just right.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.208
Oh, come on, Chloe.

12:03.291 --> 12:04.917
You're not gonna be here all night.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.375
It's just a hand.

12:06.750 --> 12:08.792
Look, all you have to do
is put the hand back...

12:14.500 --> 12:16.500
Yeah, you're gonna be here all night.

12:25.083 --> 12:27.166
I can't believe you got us
fired from the museum.

12:27.250 --> 12:30.041
- You ruin everything.
- That is so not true.

12:30.125 --> 12:33.500
At my last birthday,
you mistook my grandma for a piñata.

12:34.375 --> 12:37.125
No one was complaining
when candy started dropping out of her.

12:37.667 --> 12:41.375
I just realized Chloe is stuck
in the museum, cleaning up our mess.

12:41.667 --> 12:44.417
I'm gonna text Sydney and he and I
are gonna help her clean up.

12:44.625 --> 12:47.250
Yeah, Sydney's
never stabbed me in the back.

12:47.750 --> 12:48.792
You know what, Milton?

12:49.500 --> 12:51.333
If Chloe's the girl of your dreams...

12:51.917 --> 12:54.583
then as your friend, I respect that...

12:55.250 --> 12:56.291
And I'll back off.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.625
Wow, Jerry, that...

12:59.125 --> 13:00.166
That means a lot.

13:00.834 --> 13:02.542
- Thanks for understanding.
- Yeah, man.

13:03.458 --> 13:04.834
Uh, where are you going?

13:04.917 --> 13:07.709
To the museum to make the girl
of your dreams my girlfriend.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.125
<i>Whoo!</i>
-

13:13.667 --> 13:16.291
And maybe I'll start with a salad.

13:18.291 --> 13:19.875
See the attitude on her?

13:20.291 --> 13:23.083
You know, you're shown on tv
beating up one defenseless, old lady

13:23.166 --> 13:25.959
and suddenly the whole world
thinks you're a jerk.

13:26.041 --> 13:28.166
Come on, Rudy, you're exaggerating.

13:31.917 --> 13:33.083
I don't think i am.

13:34.333 --> 13:35.709
At least she left off the dressing.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.208
Uh, excuse me, waitress.

13:41.834 --> 13:44.625
May I have some fresh pepper
for my lap salad?

13:48.166 --> 13:49.208
Little more.

13:51.208 --> 13:52.166
Thank you.

13:57.083 --> 13:59.583
Oh, there's the worst man in the world.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.959
Quick, everyone, hide your grannies.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.792
It was a man-granny I ordered online.

14:06.750 --> 14:07.667
Making it worse, Rudy.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.291
Apparently that's what I do.

14:11.875 --> 14:12.875
Look at him over there.

14:12.959 --> 14:15.417
He ruins my life
and then he just laughs at me.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.000
I am so angry.

14:18.375 --> 14:21.208
It's a good thing I've devoted my life
to the study of martial arts.

14:21.291 --> 14:23.041
Oh, great,
so you're gonna tap into your chi

14:23.125 --> 14:24.333
and overcome your anger?

14:24.417 --> 14:25.417
Something like that.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.291
Once we get the golden sword
from Hashindo's sarcophagus,

14:47.375 --> 14:49.375
- sell it for $80,000,
- Yeah...

14:49.458 --> 14:50.750
and take out expenses.

14:51.375 --> 14:52.875
How much do you think each of us will get?

14:52.959 --> 14:55.083
Don't look at me.

14:55.166 --> 14:56.750
Math is not really my thing.

14:57.125 --> 14:59.375
How can math not be your thing?
You're Albert Einstein!

14:59.458 --> 15:01.792
I got the gig because of my hair!

15:02.125 --> 15:03.709
And you know that, Carl!

15:07.667 --> 15:09.125
Oh, I can't believe it.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.250
The Living Legends
are just a bunch of thieves.

15:11.875 --> 15:13.667
And they've got my girlfriend.

15:13.792 --> 15:15.000
Your girlfriend?

15:15.083 --> 15:17.542
Yeah. Stop it. No, you stop it.

15:20.166 --> 15:22.083
We need a plan. Stop it!

15:25.166 --> 15:28.291
We hate Rudy. We hate Rudy...

15:36.417 --> 15:38.583
Uh, excuse me, ma'am.
I'm sorry, we're closed.

15:39.166 --> 15:40.041
It's me.

15:41.959 --> 15:44.875
This is the only way I could get through
that mob of angry grannies

15:44.959 --> 15:46.375
after what I did to their friend Ethel.

15:46.458 --> 15:48.458
Yeah, this is my life now, Jack.

15:48.542 --> 15:51.583
Dinner at four, bingo at five,
gotta watch the grandkids at eight.

15:51.667 --> 15:52.583
And don't even ask me why,

15:52.667 --> 15:54.542
but i got a pocket
full of butterscotch candies.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.834
Oh... here it is, Rudy,
your new episode's on.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.583
I can't watch this.

16:05.667 --> 16:06.709
That's better.

16:07.291 --> 16:10.834
<i>Last night,
we introduced you to Rudy Gillespie,</i>

16:10.917 --> 16:12.667
<i>"The worst man In the world."</i>

16:14.375 --> 16:17.792
<i>Well, guess what?
On tonight's episode, he's back,</i>

16:18.125 --> 16:21.041
<i>and what you're about to see
will shock you.</i>

16:21.542 --> 16:22.625
Here we go.

16:22.875 --> 16:24.458
My life is over.

16:34.625 --> 16:36.917
<i>A falafel ball went down the wrong pipe!</i>

16:37.166 --> 16:39.083
<i>Rudy Gillespie just saved my life!</i>

16:39.792 --> 16:41.041
- She did?
- I did?

16:41.458 --> 16:42.667
<i>He's a hero.</i>

16:43.041 --> 16:44.250
- She is?
- I am?

16:45.208 --> 16:49.917
<i>America, Rudy punched my gut
and touched my heart.</i>

16:52.041 --> 16:53.500
Did you see what I did, Jack?

16:54.041 --> 16:55.166
I don't believe it!

16:55.625 --> 16:56.792
I'm a hero!

16:58.291 --> 16:59.667
Hey, Rudy, where are you going?

16:59.750 --> 17:02.792
To tell those cane-wielding prune suckers
that they owe me an apology.

17:02.875 --> 17:04.250
No, wait, Rudy, you're forgetting...

17:04.333 --> 17:06.375
they couldn't have seen the new episode.

17:06.458 --> 17:07.792
Get him!

17:10.834 --> 17:12.583
They didn't see the episode!

17:22.917 --> 17:23.792
Hey!

17:24.208 --> 17:25.375
We know why you're here.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.208
You're nothing but a bunch of thieves.

17:27.375 --> 17:28.291
Yeah...

17:28.875 --> 17:30.166
And horrible actors.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.542
That's it. Tie 'em up, guys.

17:36.166 --> 17:37.750
I'll take the small chick.

17:49.709 --> 17:52.625
This might not be the best time
but who are you going to prom with?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.458
Not a good time? All right, gotta go.

18:00.166 --> 18:03.625
You can't see this,
but that gag really makes your eyes pop.

18:29.959 --> 18:32.125
I call the big dude next time.

18:43.583 --> 18:44.959
Oh.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.458
Yes, this is <i>fantastisch.</i>

18:51.458 --> 18:54.250
Did... did anybody else see that?

18:54.750 --> 18:55.792
I did.

18:56.291 --> 18:58.291
The samurai warriors
have come back to life.

18:58.542 --> 19:00.583
It's the legend of Hashindo's sword.

19:00.709 --> 19:03.834
Really? You think I'm buying
some absurd legend...

19:06.375 --> 19:07.917
Okay, I'm buying. I'm buying.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.458
Put back the sword, Carl!

19:12.542 --> 19:13.542
No!

19:14.083 --> 19:15.542
I'm not giving it back.

19:15.625 --> 19:16.542
It's mine.

19:16.625 --> 19:18.625
Fine, keep it.

19:30.291 --> 19:32.375
Can someone explain what just happened?

19:32.542 --> 19:34.291
We made them believe the legend was real.

19:34.417 --> 19:35.417
No...

19:36.458 --> 19:38.291
I made him believe the legend was real.

19:39.083 --> 19:41.583
How did you produce that demonic roar?

19:41.667 --> 19:43.291
The armor yanked out my only pit hair,

19:43.542 --> 19:44.625
but it was worth it.

19:46.083 --> 19:47.792
Teddy, go call the cops.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.792
What you did was incredible.

19:51.375 --> 19:52.625
You saved me.

19:52.834 --> 19:55.083
Aw, it was really nothing.

19:55.166 --> 19:56.583
Seriously, stop it.

19:58.375 --> 20:00.125
There's something you two should know.

20:00.458 --> 20:01.917
Oh, I know what it is.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.500
In the beginning, you thought we were
more trouble than we were worth

20:04.583 --> 20:06.583
because we destroyed
the caveman skeletons.

20:06.667 --> 20:09.250
But when we came here,
foiled a robbery, and saved you

20:09.291 --> 20:12.041
and the museum,
we totally redeemed ourselves.

20:12.458 --> 20:13.375
No.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.625
Sydney's my new boyfriend.

20:17.166 --> 20:19.375
I did not see that coming.

20:19.959 --> 20:20.875
Wha...

20:25.750 --> 20:26.625
Milton,

20:27.417 --> 20:29.291
dude, I'm sorry
I tried to take your girl...

20:29.792 --> 20:32.041
and for all the future girls
I'm gonna try and take from you.

20:33.083 --> 20:34.458
I'm sorry, too.

20:35.041 --> 20:37.000
And don't worry,
Chloe's not gonna have time

20:37.083 --> 20:38.500
for a date with Sydney, anyway.

20:39.125 --> 20:40.000
She's not?

20:43.959 --> 20:46.208
Oh, Chloe!

20:47.000 --> 20:48.125
Whoo!

20:50.875 --> 20:52.709
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

20:52.875 --> 20:55.542
The business you generate for the museum
as the new Living Legends

20:55.625 --> 20:57.500
will help pay for the damage you caused.

21:00.125 --> 21:03.291
Nerds.

21:06.709 --> 21:08.625
I am Paul Revere

21:08.709 --> 21:10.083
and the Living Legends are coming!

21:10.166 --> 21:11.709
The living legends are coming...

21:12.375 --> 21:14.625
to the Seaford Museum Of History.

21:17.083 --> 21:18.125
Are we done yet?

21:18.208 --> 21:19.834
We've been doing this for four hours.

21:19.917 --> 21:22.375
Yeah, and we have four more.
So put your head back on.

21:22.709 --> 21:23.709
Hyah!

21:23.792 --> 21:25.667
That's it.

21:27.917 --> 21:30.625
Bad horsey, bad horsey, bad horsey!

21:57.041 --> 21:57.875
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:02.000 --> 22:02.834
<i>Yes!</i>
