00:02.560 --> 00:05.360
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.440 --> 00:07.360
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.400
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:16.280
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

00:18.480 --> 00:20.320
<i>Michael was meeting...</i>

00:20.400 --> 00:22.360
<i>with the company's accountant,
Ira Gilligan.</i>

00:22.480 --> 00:24.440
Anyway, I have gone over this
10 different ways...

00:24.520 --> 00:26.498
and you're reporting
income on an account that...

00:26.499 --> 00:28.040
You know, it is just freezing in here.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.000
Well, the thermostat
is in my office.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.880
While it's freezing in here, it's still
hot in there. So please continue.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.240
There's basically no money where it
should be. I think I'm catching a cold.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.960
- You're not catching a cold.
- I know my body.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.520
- There's no money in the account?
- I'm sorry.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.480
- This is like the bayou in here.
- I tried to tell you that.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.280
I guess I just had
to find out for myself.

00:48.360 --> 00:51.920
Anyway, this isn't the first
discrepancy with your father's books.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.240
With this court case coming up,
I just have to warn you...

00:54.320 --> 00:56.320
if they ask me to testify,
I am not gonna lie.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.240
<i>- No one's asking you to lie.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

00:58.360 --> 01:00.240
You're asking Gilligan
not to lie?

01:00.320 --> 01:02.840
Please call me Ira.
I don't like Gilligan.

01:02.920 --> 01:04.800
Who doesn't like Gilligan?

01:04.920 --> 01:07.520
Is it cold in here?

01:07.640 --> 01:10.040
So, listen. You have been married two
weeks now. It seems to be sticking.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.840
And let's pretend
it's a good thing.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.920
I guess this makes me
your best man...

01:14.040 --> 01:17.600
and I would like to throw you
a bachelor party.

01:17.720 --> 01:19.920
Yeah, I don't think
she'd go for that.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.160
Besides, I talked to Dad. He said it was
stupid to get married in the first place.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.400
And he's right. He's right.
I've gotta get rid of her.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.840
You know, I... I said two weeks ago that
I thought it was a stupid idea.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.560
Suddenly Dad says it
and it's good advice?

01:31.680 --> 01:33.640
You know you don't have to do
everything Dad says.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.120
I don't do everything Dad says. He just
happens to be right about this.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.680
<i>You can help me
get rid ofher though.</i>

01:38.760 --> 01:41.160
Mom's having a cocktail party. She'll be
there. Maybe you can try to break us up.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.520
- I can't do that.
- Why not? You did it with me and Marta.

01:43.640 --> 01:46.240
<i>You had no problem with that, guy.
You know what? Lie to her.</i>

01:46.360 --> 01:48.960
Tell her that I'm
insensitive and unreliable.

01:49.080 --> 01:51.032
Something about how you
can never confront people.

01:51.033 --> 01:52.640
You need someone to
clean up your messes.

01:52.760 --> 01:55.000
See, that's great. And that's just
off the top of your head.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.240
<i>Michael, Gob. I was just
in the neighborhood.</i>

01:57.320 --> 01:59.920
Good Lord.
It is sweltering in here.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.400
As you may
or may not know...

02:03.520 --> 02:05.880
Lindsay and I have hit
a bit of a rough patch.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.639
<i>- Really? When did that start?
- Well...</i>

02:08.759 --> 02:11.560
I don't want
to blame it all on 9/11...

02:11.680 --> 02:13.280
<i>but it certainly
didn't help.</i>

02:13.400 --> 02:15.520
But anyway, I need your help.
If you could possibly...

02:15.600 --> 02:17.440
Could we go back
to your office, please?

02:17.560 --> 02:20.280
I just want to be
a family again.

02:20.360 --> 02:24.280
I guess what I'm saying is
I want to reunite the band.

02:24.360 --> 02:26.880
<i>- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no"was right.</i>

02:27.000 --> 02:30.720
<i>In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk
music group with Lindsay and Maeby...</i>

02:30.840 --> 02:35.280
<i>called Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural
Good-Time Family-Band Solution.</i>

02:35.360 --> 02:38.840
<i>The group was underwritten by
the Natural Life Food Company...</i>

02:38.920 --> 02:42.600
<i>a division of Chem Grow, an Allyn-Crane
acquisition, and part of the Squimm Group.</i>

02:42.720 --> 02:46.040
<i>Their motto was simple.
"We keep you alive. "</i>

02:49.760 --> 02:51.600
Zanotab may cause
dry mouth, hair loss...

02:51.680 --> 02:55.160
an overly alert feeling, and in some
cases may diminish your sex drive.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.480
Well, there's a wellness
convention in town...

02:58.560 --> 03:01.440
and I thought maybe you could talk
Lindsay into joining me up onstage.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.117
<i>- Yeah. Why don't you ask her?</i>

03:03.118 --> 03:05.760
- Oh, I would, but she just
doesn't take me seriously.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.560
<i>Michael tried to find the
money the accountant said was missing.</i>

03:10.680 --> 03:12.800
I don't know.
I probably stole it.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.040
I mean, if he says
it's missing, it is.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.640
Unless he stole it.
Hey, maybe he stole it.

03:17.760 --> 03:20.880
- He's the one that said it's missing.
- Yeah, I probably stole it.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.560
Well, we need to find it
before Ira is asked to testify.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.105
- I thought we were talking
about Gilligan. Who's Ira?

03:25.106 --> 03:25.520
- Ira Gilligan.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.840
Ira's his first name.
He actually hates to be called Gilligan.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.080
Well,
he never told me that.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.440
Gilligan has promised me that all
this money will be saved in I.R.A.s.

03:33.560 --> 03:36.440
- It's Ira, sir.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Gilligan.

03:36.520 --> 03:39.320
Will be saved in "Iras. "

03:39.400 --> 03:41.560
- What the hell is this, Gilligan?
- It's Ira, sir.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.720
- Please call me...
- Gilligan!

03:43.840 --> 03:45.880
Michael, if he testifies,
I am screwed.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.680
Here's what you do. You take him
out for some fishing or something.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.000
- Why would I take him fishing?
- Fun. Guy fun.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.720
- Let's get him on our side.
- No. Look. I'm not taking him fishing.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.080
Oh, that's right.
You hated fishing.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.560
- No, I didn't.
- No, I'll get Gob. Yeah. He liked it.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.720
- Hang on a second.
- He's the one who's fun.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.480
I liked fishing.
Where are you going? I'm fun.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.440
It's just that...
Listen.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.400
The way to fix this Ira thing
is not to buy him off. All right?

04:08.480 --> 04:11.800
- It's to find out where the money went.
- You're no fun.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.000
Yeah.
I'm plenty fun.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.399
<i>That night
the family gathered at Lucille's...</i>

04:18.519 --> 04:20.480
<i>to welcome Gob's wife.</i>

04:20.600 --> 04:23.720
I have always wanted a daughter.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.760
And a blonde.
What fun.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.840
<i>- Where did Annyong get thatjuice box?
- Annyong.</i>

04:28.960 --> 04:32.280
Those are for his soccer team. No sugar
for you. You just get more awful.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.280
Hey, Adopted Brother.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.360
Do you think I could have a hit
of that juice box? That...

<i>Michael tried
to convince Lindsay to rejoin...</i>

04:50.080 --> 04:54.080
<i>Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural
Good-Time Family-Band Solution.</i>

04:54.200 --> 04:58.360
Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural Good-Time
Family-Band Solution was a nightmare for me.

04:58.440 --> 05:02.160
Hmm. Well, he said it was
the most fun your family's ever had.

05:02.240 --> 05:05.040
Yeah, well, I was wacked
on Zanotab the entire time.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.280
I thought Zanotab was supposed
to make everything a little bit better.

05:07.360 --> 05:11.160
For 15 minutes. Then it burns when
you pee, and your marriage goes to hell.

05:11.280 --> 05:14.680
It is not a good supplement. Besides,
Maeby's not gonna want to do it.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.160
<i>I wanna do it!
Are you kidding me?</i>

05:17.280 --> 05:19.280
<i>Those were
our best times ever.</i>

05:19.360 --> 05:22.600
This party just keeps
gettin' better.

05:22.720 --> 05:26.160
So, uh... You know, if you want me
on wood block, I can keep perfect time.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.440
Some call me
the human metronome.

05:28.520 --> 05:31.080
You notice how I'm always on time?
I'm never late for things.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.680
Yeah, but I think punctuality
is slightly different from rhythm.

05:33.760 --> 05:37.440
No, it's not. It's the exact same thing.
It's knowing how long things take.

05:37.560 --> 05:41.840
Look. I'm just doing this because if my
parents split up, it's a lot more work for me.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.560
I know.
They split up once in Boston.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.200
<i>When they get along,
I get tons more alone time.</i>

05:47.320 --> 05:49.520
<i>When they don't, guess who
they start spending all their time with.</i>

05:49.600 --> 05:49.855
- Me.

05:49.856 --> 05:52.960
- We've been talking here for
28 seconds. Just so you know.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.840
<i>Excuse me.
Dr. "Funky?"</i>

05:57.920 --> 06:02.440
- Ah, Fünke. - Of Dr. Fünke's 100%
Natural Good-Time Family-Band Solution?

06:02.560 --> 06:05.200
- Yes!
- Oh, my... I saw you in '96.

06:05.280 --> 06:05.557
- Oh!

06:05.558 --> 06:08.600
- You sang a song about a
supplement called Teamocil?

06:08.680 --> 06:10.840
- Teamocil.
- I mean, you just nailed me!

06:10.920 --> 06:14.040
It was like you knew every side effect
I was going through at that time.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.080
- Sadly, Teamocil has been discontinued.
- Oh.

06:22.200 --> 06:24.600
The sense of wellness
it created in relationships...

06:24.720 --> 06:28.000
was merely the first sign of
complete pituitary shutdown.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.708
- Excuse me? Are you,
uh... Hi. I'm Michael.

06:29.709 --> 06:29.920
- Hi.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.840
- I'm Gob's brother.
- Yes. He told me all about you.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.920
- You have a terrific voice.
- I smell olives!

06:36.000 --> 06:37.920
<i>And Michael, as per Gob's request...</i>

06:38.040 --> 06:40.840
<i>tried to convince his wife
that Gob was unreliable.</i>

06:40.960 --> 06:43.120
So, Gob is late. But I guess
that's who you married.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.920
He's probably out trying to do
something very important.

06:46.040 --> 06:50.400
Are you hitting on me?
Gob said that would happen.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.360
Hey, Gob. It's a good thing
you're not staying married to this girl.

06:57.440 --> 07:01.560
You've got her hating me... at least your
version of me, which is actually you.

07:01.640 --> 07:06.840
Well, I talked to Dad,
and he thinks that I should stay in it.

07:06.920 --> 07:07.779
Stay in the marriage?

07:07.780 --> 07:10.560
You're not letting Dad lead you
around by the nose again, are you?

07:10.680 --> 07:14.640
Think about it. I've got the marriage
and none of the good parts.

07:14.720 --> 07:17.520
It's like, so far it's been
all chain and no ball.

07:17.600 --> 07:17.890
- Sure.

07:17.891 --> 07:20.000
- So, we'll have a ceremony
and a bachelor party.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.920
A bachelor party?
You want one now? Come on.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.262
- You're not giving your best
man a whole lot of prep time.

07:25.263 --> 07:26.040
- Dad can handle it.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.520
- Dad?
- Yeah. You know.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.520
He's a fun guy, and...

07:32.640 --> 07:33.829
- I'm making him my best man.

07:33.830 --> 07:35.880
- You're making Dad your
best man. That's great.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.800
I guess
being your brother...

07:37.920 --> 07:40.400
and solving all your problems for you
doesn't qualify me as your best man.

07:40.480 --> 07:44.400
Hey. If he wants to support me,
I'm not gonna tell him to go to hell.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.520
- Don't worry. You're still...
- What? Invited?

07:47.640 --> 07:50.880
No, I was gonna say you're still the guy
I want solving my problems, but, yeah...

07:51.000 --> 07:53.680
Let me talk to Dad
about that invite situation.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.280
<i>The next day, Gob visited his father...</i>

08:03.360 --> 08:05.200
<i>to prepare
for his bachelor party.</i>

08:05.280 --> 08:07.240
You know, I really think
that you're gonna like this woman.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.560
Well, she's costing me enough, but
she's... oh, she's a hell of a stripper.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.320
- No, I mean my wife.
- Oh.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.840
Well, I... I doubt that
very much.

08:14.920 --> 08:19.520
Well, I can tell you that Michael was
pretty upset that you wanted to be best man.

08:19.640 --> 08:20.992
- Don't worry about Michael.

08:20.993 --> 08:23.600
- Yeah, my bachelor party's
about having fun, right?

08:23.680 --> 08:27.240
No, no. Your bachelor party's about convincing
Gilligan that he's killed a stripper...

08:27.360 --> 08:29.240
getting him out of town
so he can't testify...

08:29.360 --> 08:31.560
<i>and making sure that people think
that he took the money.</i>

08:31.680 --> 08:33.440
- It is?
- Yeah.

08:33.559 --> 08:37.159
This accountant can do us a lot of damage.
I want him neutralized. Do you hear me?

08:37.280 --> 08:39.787
That's why I want you
to use this stripper...

08:39.788 --> 08:41.640
a narcoleptic, believe it or not.

08:41.760 --> 08:45.480
A friend of mine at the yacht club,
he used her for his bachelor party.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.800
We wanted you
to have the first piece!

08:52.920 --> 08:55.320
You put her in a darkened space,
she's out.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.160
You get him drunk.
He passes out.

08:57.280 --> 09:01.360
Then you cover the floor with corn syrup,
mixed with a little red dye.

09:01.440 --> 09:04.880
He comes to. "Eee! Blood! Aaah!"
He freaks out.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.800
Okay. But how do you know
that he's gonna leave the country?

09:06.880 --> 09:10.080
That's why I got you those honeymoon
tickets. You never thanked me for those.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.040
I'm sorry. I meant to. I was gonna...

09:12.160 --> 09:14.720
You just have to convince him
that this happened.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.560
- That he killed a stripper?
- Can you do this?

09:17.640 --> 09:19.720
Can I trust you? You're not
gonna go all Michael on me, are ya?

09:19.840 --> 09:21.640
Nobody's turning
all Michael on you.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.600
But when you get out, then we're gonna
have a real party. Right, Dad?

09:24.680 --> 09:26.520
Are you kidding?
When I get out of here...

09:26.600 --> 09:28.920
you're gonna throw me the biggest
party this town's ever seen.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.200
All right?

09:31.320 --> 09:33.200
<i>Back at the model home...</i>

09:35.360 --> 09:38.160
Stop!
It is not Zanotab.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.960
Well, maybe if I was allowed to have
a Zanotab, I'd remember it's Euphorazine.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.440
No. We are not going to do that again.
This family is not about to start using.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.720
We are pushers,
not takers.

09:46.840 --> 09:50.760
Okay. Once more, from the bridge.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.080
What is that noise?

09:56.160 --> 09:58.680
We don't need
the wood block.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.400
No, I just thought
I would join in on the fun.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.560
I mean, you guys are always talking about,
you know, family and loving and...

10:04.640 --> 10:06.200
having good times
in the circle...

10:06.280 --> 10:08.120
You know what?
This isn't working.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.640
Maybe I'm just gonna go off
and rehearse with Maeby alone.

10:10.720 --> 10:12.680
Oh, fine. Then I'll rehearse
with Maeby after dinner.

10:14.120 --> 10:17.240
No! This is wholesome,
family fun, okay?

10:17.320 --> 10:19.960
Let's take it from loose stool!
One, two and a...

10:20.040 --> 10:21.880
What is that in your mouth?
Is that a Euphorazine?

10:21.960 --> 10:23.800
Lindsay, spit it out!
That's not real happiness!

10:23.880 --> 10:25.497
- Well, it's better
than what we've got now.

10:25.498 --> 10:26.360
- Lindsay, spit it out!

10:26.440 --> 10:28.200
<i>And Michael arrived home...</i>

10:28.320 --> 10:31.000
<i>determined to prove
that he was, in fact, fun.</i>

10:31.080 --> 10:33.040
I just booked us
a little fishing trip.

10:33.120 --> 10:36.440
- But why? What did I do?
- Hmm? No, no. This is a fun thing!

10:36.560 --> 10:38.520
Okay? Something I've always
wanted to do with you.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.800
Everybody's always having fun
around here. Why can't we?

10:40.920 --> 10:45.240
<i>Already down! Get
your finger out of my throat! It's down!</i>

10:45.320 --> 10:48.680
- Anyway, I thought you hated fishing.
- No, it's fun. I like fun.

10:48.800 --> 10:53.160
I just hated doing it with my dad.
This is gonna be you and me. Okay?

10:53.280 --> 10:55.681
We get to stay at a hotel,
get up at 4:00 a. m.,

10:55.682 --> 10:57.200
slap on the old seasick patch.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.098
We're gonna get out
there on the choppy ocean.

10:59.099 --> 11:00.800
We're gonna catch
ourselves a little lunch.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.200
Oh, we get to eat it?

11:03.320 --> 11:05.720
After we gut it.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.440
Yes.

11:07.520 --> 11:10.040
<i>While the Bluth boys
contemplated having fun...</i>

11:10.120 --> 11:13.160
<i>Lucille had a request
for Gob's bachelor party.</i>

11:13.280 --> 11:15.960
- Why do I have to bring him?
- Because Buster's your brother...

11:16.040 --> 11:20.120
and I'm not gonna leave him home alone
with all this J-U-I-C-E around.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.960
I can spell, Mom.
You spelled "juice. "

11:23.040 --> 11:25.520
Oh, you're so brilliant.
Let's see you find it.

11:25.600 --> 11:29.040
Besides, I'm going to Annyong's
soccer award ceremony...

11:29.400 --> 11:31.240
<i>Annyong.</i>

11:36.840 --> 11:38.800
And I don't need the other soccer moms

11:38.801 --> 11:41.120
knowing how old my
first batch of kids are.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.246
<i>- Yeah, I think they're
gonna know that Annyong's...</i>

11:43.247 --> 11:43.640
- Annyong.

11:43.720 --> 11:46.720
Would somebody please tell
this insufferable child to...

11:46.840 --> 11:48.480
God!

11:48.600 --> 11:50.400
<i>And so, as Michael and his son...</i>

11:50.520 --> 11:52.480
<i>checked into the hotel,
his brothers arrived.</i>

11:52.600 --> 11:56.000
- What are you guys doing here?
- Oh, we're having Gob's bachelor party.

11:56.120 --> 11:59.320
You're not going? Even Dad's coming...
Via satellite.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.880
Uh, no. I'm gonna go fishing with my son
here. We're gonna go have some fun.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.880
Real fun. Okay? Not everything is
strippers and booze and buckets of blood.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.560
<i>Why do you guys
have buckets ofblood?</i>

12:10.680 --> 12:12.640
It's not real blood.
It's corn syrup and red dye.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.320
- Juice.
- We have unlimited juice?

12:15.400 --> 12:19.440
This party is gonna be off the hook.

12:21.480 --> 12:24.680
<i>Meanwhile, at the wellness
convention in the very same hotel...</i>

12:24.800 --> 12:28.560
<i>Dr. Fünke's 100% Natural Good-Time
Family-Band Solution...</i>

12:28.640 --> 12:30.560
<i>was preparing for their show.</i>

12:30.640 --> 12:33.080
Here are the new
Euphorazine side effects.

12:33.160 --> 12:37.160
<i>Ah, the solo. That is for my lovely
and talented daughter.</i>

12:37.280 --> 12:39.480
"Delayed irritability?"
What do they mean by delayed?

12:39.560 --> 12:41.360
It means it comes later!
This is ridiculous!

12:41.361 --> 12:42.640
Why do we even have to do this?

12:42.720 --> 12:45.800
We are doing this
to keep our family together.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.920
No, I'm serious.
We're dressed like we're in the '60s.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.552
- It's the 21 st century. We should
be dressing like it's the '80s.

12:51.553 --> 12:52.040
- Lindsay...

12:52.160 --> 12:55.040
I'm tired of trying to find happiness
through lies and self-medicating.

12:55.160 --> 12:58.040
If you need me,
I'll be at the bar.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.960
Well, fine, Lindsay.
That's fine.

13:00.040 --> 13:03.160
- Maeby and I'll just do...
- Yeah. I'm out too.

13:06.400 --> 13:10.200
You think you can handle it alone? 'Cause
if you don't perform, we don't validate.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.160
<i>Back in Michael's hotel room...</i>

13:17.280 --> 13:19.360
<i>the guys were settling down
for the night...</i>

13:19.480 --> 13:22.080
<i>so as to be ready
for their 4:00 a. m. wake-up call.</i>

13:22.200 --> 13:24.840
It sure sounds like they're
having fun out there by the pool.

13:24.960 --> 13:28.320
Oh, they think they're having fun,
Son, but it's not lasting fun.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.840
It is fleeting fun,
like a bachelor party.

13:33.440 --> 13:38.280
What we got here is lasting fun.
Okay? You think about that.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.560
- Good night, Son.
- Good night, Dad.

13:41.640 --> 13:44.320
<i>- Marco!
- Polo!</i>

13:44.400 --> 13:46.240
<i>Marco!</i>

13:46.320 --> 13:48.960
<i>- Polo!
- Marco!</i>

13:49.080 --> 13:52.720
<i>- Hey, Dad?
- Polo!</i>

13:52.800 --> 13:56.120
- Dad, are you still awake?
- Still awake.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.400
It's just, um...

13:58.480 --> 14:00.680
I mean, this is really fun
and everything...

14:00.800 --> 14:03.640
This isn't even the fun part.
Tomorrow...

14:03.720 --> 14:05.680
Yeah.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.160
The problem I'm having
is, uh...

14:08.280 --> 14:11.602
- I have a pretty finely
tuned internal clock...

14:11.603 --> 14:12.280
- Mm
- hmm.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.640
which is why I'm actually
such a good natural percussionist.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.200
<i>And, um...</i>

14:17.280 --> 14:19.360
I'm just worried that I'm not
gonna be able to fall asleep...

14:19.480 --> 14:21.880
for another two hours
and 45 minutes.

14:21.960 --> 14:25.160
So, I was thinking maybe I would
go down and check out Maeby's band...

14:25.280 --> 14:27.640
and you could go see if Gob's
bachelor party has started.

14:27.720 --> 14:30.840
Shh, shh, shh.
I'm right where I want to be.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.920
<i>Gob had his chance
to have me there...</i>

14:33.000 --> 14:34.400
but if you're sure
that you can't sleep.

14:34.520 --> 14:37.760
It's just... I don't know when I'm gonna
get another chance like this...

14:37.880 --> 14:39.680
- you know, to be there for family.
- Right.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.798
- I'd hate to miss it,
because I was too proud.

14:42.799 --> 14:43.360
- Right.

14:47.040 --> 14:51.160
Wait a minute. "Too proud?" What does
this have to do with "too proud?"

14:51.240 --> 14:53.440
Actually, that part
was kinda just for you.

14:53.560 --> 14:58.560
I was just worried the whole thing wasn't
gonna land unless I included the pride part.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.960
<i>Upstairs, Gob was
preparing to set up the accountant...</i>

15:01.080 --> 15:03.840
<i>under his father's
helpful gaze.</i>

15:03.960 --> 15:06.240
<i>- Who called the cops?
- And with the aid of some helpful gays.</i>

15:06.360 --> 15:08.160
You told me to hire people
to look like my friends.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.320
<i>They're Hot Cops.
They're entertainers.</i>

15:10.400 --> 15:13.800
<i>Although I specifically asked them
not to come dressed as cops.</i>

15:13.920 --> 15:17.440
You better change now. He's gonna be
here soon. Butch, guys. I want it butch.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.360
Hey, uh,
you got the blood. Right?

15:19.480 --> 15:22.280
Yeah, I got two buckets full right... Hey!
What the hell happened to the blood?

15:24.320 --> 15:27.200
<i>- Hey, Brother.
- Whoa!</i>

15:27.320 --> 15:30.400
<i>- Somebody put on his lipstick in the car.
- I love juice!</i>

15:30.520 --> 15:34.880
This next number is the only ballad
that the Solution ever attempted.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.240
And I must say
I feel a bit like a Mary...

15:37.320 --> 15:40.960
without a Peter and a Paul,
but I suppose it's worth a shot.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.760
"Teamocil is
no longer available.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.440
<i>Please try either Grouphug, Bondat
or consult your own Wellness Guide. "</i>

16:17.560 --> 16:19.760
Teamocil!

16:22.520 --> 16:24.640
You're out of the band.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.680
<i>And, back at the bachelor party...</i>

16:26.800 --> 16:29.960
<i>Gilligan had arrived,
and the con was in full swing.</i>

16:30.080 --> 16:31.320
It's Ira,
and I'm fine.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.360
Come on! Have a drink!

16:33.440 --> 16:36.120
There's some stuff coming up you
might not be able to handle sober.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.480
Speaking of which,
where's Buster?

16:39.560 --> 16:41.400
<i>In fact, Buster had finished thejuice...</i>

16:41.480 --> 16:43.560
<i>and was desperately looking
for his next sugar fix...</i>

16:43.680 --> 16:45.520
<i>when he discovered the cake
in the next room.</i>

16:45.600 --> 16:49.880
<i>Unfortunately, he was unaware of the
narcoleptic stripper confined within it.</i>

16:53.640 --> 16:55.720
Yeah, I better go in the
back room and have a look for him.

16:55.840 --> 16:59.480
<i>- Ira, have a drink!
- I'm not thirsty. I want some food.</i>

16:59.560 --> 17:01.640
<i>Ooh.</i>

17:01.760 --> 17:03.560
Okay. Keep it together.
Don't go all Michael here.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.240
Knock, knock!
Where's the married bachelor?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.640
Michael, I thought you weren't coming.
I thought he wasn't coming!

17:08.760 --> 17:12.200
Well, I wasn't going to, but he's my
brother, and I'm here to support him...

17:12.319 --> 17:17.280
like all these, uh,
hot men and Ira.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.319
Well, you're not gonna stay.
I mean, this isn't your kind of scene.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.911
Dad, please, stay out of it, all right?

17:21.912 --> 17:23.760
I'm here for Gob. Now,
where are the strippers?

17:23.839 --> 17:24.319
- Well, I...

17:24.320 --> 17:26.200
- Mmm! You got a little
back room going, huh?

17:26.280 --> 17:28.119
- Huh? Huh?
- Well...

17:28.200 --> 17:31.600
just relax. I'm as fun as anybody.
I can handle a back room.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.800
- I'm calling the cops. - No!
- We're changing again, guys!

17:35.880 --> 17:38.560
- No. No cops.
- Well, what is this?

17:39.840 --> 17:41.920
She died.
She's dead.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.640
<i>- It was Gilligan!
- What?</i>

17:44.760 --> 17:46.560
Gilligan killed
the skipper... stripper.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.480
I didn't kill
any stripper.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.600
- You're drunk. You don't remember.
- You're pulling the rip cord!

17:50.720 --> 17:54.640
Ira, take my honeymoon tickets.
Get out of the country. Save yourself.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.822
- I'm not drunk. Bix made
me the designated driver.

17:57.823 --> 17:58.240
- Bix!

17:58.360 --> 18:00.560
<i>Just then, the stripper woke up...</i>

18:00.640 --> 18:02.920
<i>saw Buster with what appeared
to be blood around his mouth...</i>

18:03.040 --> 18:05.417
<i>- and thought she had
killed him for groping her.</i>

18:05.418 --> 18:06.000
- Not again.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.160
You were setting me up.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.200
You're trying to get me
to leave the country.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.920
Well, the hell with you, sir.
Bix, we're leaving.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.560
I'm testifying.

18:21.640 --> 18:24.040
<i>Yeah, the party's over. That's it.</i>

18:24.160 --> 18:26.040
You were trying
to set Ira up?

18:26.120 --> 18:28.960
<i>Oh, Gob, Gob.
Come on. Is this true?</i>

18:29.080 --> 18:31.600
Oh, wait a minute.
It wasn't your idea, Gob.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.400
- It was your idea. Wasn't it, Dad?
- It wa...

18:34.520 --> 18:34.788
- Huh?

18:34.789 --> 18:36.840
- Even if it was my
idea, which it wasn't...

18:36.960 --> 18:40.400
Gob screwed it up,
which he did and always does.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.800
- You don't have to take that.
- What the hell am I supposed to do?

18:43.880 --> 18:46.080
Here.

18:47.640 --> 18:52.720
- Oh, no. No, no. Don't you dare, mister.
- Do it. Do it.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.320
<i>Hey, Gob! I am your best man.
I am your fath...</i>

18:58.520 --> 18:59.652
What does it matter?

18:59.653 --> 19:02.200
I screwed it up anyway.
A complete failure.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.960
<i>Can't even fake the death
of a stripper.</i>

19:05.080 --> 19:07.640
Oh, come on.
That's not a bad thing.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.852
<i>- It doesn't make you a
failure. Dad's the failure.</i>

19:09.853 --> 19:10.240
- Really?

19:10.360 --> 19:13.200
When he was my age, he ran
an entire company, had kids.

19:13.280 --> 19:16.440
The company was corrupt.
Look what he's trying to do to us.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.360
<i>I'll tell you something else.
You might not be a father...</i>

19:18.440 --> 19:20.360
but you are my brother.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.640
I might be a father.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.360
Why don't you start trusting
yourself. Okay? Not Dad.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.360
You're a much better man
than he is.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.120
- You're a better man than both of us.
- Well.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.800
You're the best man.
You're my best man.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.800
Not if I have an actual ceremony,
'cause Dad would kill me, but...

19:39.880 --> 19:43.080
<i>What do you say, hermano?
Help me clean up this mess?</i>

19:43.200 --> 19:44.960
What the hell.

19:46.240 --> 19:49.160
Gob, I want out.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.320
- I'm in love with your brother.
- What?

19:51.400 --> 19:53.880
- You did it again, you son of a bitch!
- No, no! She's...

19:56.360 --> 19:58.080
In-law. Tobias.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.080
Sorry. I should have
finished that thought.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.560
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

20:03.680 --> 20:05.360
