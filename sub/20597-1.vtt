01:43.195 --> 01:44.864
Mom?

01:45.282 --> 01:47.095
Dad?

01:47.199 --> 01:48.951
Al?

01:49.472 --> 01:51.222
Hello!

02:15.311 --> 02:16.998
Al?

02:32.933 --> 02:34.849
The thunderbolt.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.885
Papa.

03:34.244 --> 03:35.993
Papa.

04:01.323 --> 04:03.052
Papa.

04:58.683 --> 05:01.287
Okay! Bring her in!

05:10.402 --> 05:12.133
That's it.

05:13.301 --> 05:17.034
Okay, now put those... yeah.
Secure it over there.

05:17.868 --> 05:20.037
Yeah, the other tree.

05:20.141 --> 05:22.477
That's it. Tighten it up.

05:23.103 --> 05:25.813
Okay! Up, up!

05:26.294 --> 05:27.857
Go.

05:31.736 --> 05:34.093
Over! A little bit.

05:34.197 --> 05:37.075
Watch it. Back it up. Keep it going.

05:37.179 --> 05:39.660
Back her up. That's it.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.604
Hey, Terry,
what's that thing called again?

06:04.708 --> 06:07.334
A geode. Thunder eggs.

06:07.751 --> 06:12.445
- I don't think we should be doing this.
- Hey, chill out. They'll never know.

06:13.070 --> 06:14.946
My dad will have a seizure.

06:15.050 --> 06:18.138
It's your own fault. You should have
called me before they filled it in.

06:18.242 --> 06:20.723
- Yeah, but...
- There's gotta be more down there.

06:20.827 --> 06:24.725
You know how much you can get
for a big one? 100 bucks.

06:32.819 --> 06:35.529
It smells like something died in there.

06:35.634 --> 06:38.324
- It looks like a cave.
- Wicked.

06:38.428 --> 06:40.992
- Be careful.
- Here.

06:44.559 --> 06:47.602
- Jeez.
- It's nothin'.

06:52.755 --> 06:54.672
What is it?

06:56.489 --> 06:58.597
What the hell was that noise?

06:58.701 --> 07:01.032
I don't think we should be doing this.

07:04.412 --> 07:06.353
Who cares?

07:06.978 --> 07:08.916
We're rich.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.296
Come on.

07:16.967 --> 07:20.793
Al, don't! Wait a sec!
You promised I could have these.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.619
I said that 3 months ago.
They've been sitting in my room.

07:23.723 --> 07:25.267
But, Al...

07:25.371 --> 07:28.165
Quit calling me Al. My name is Alexandra.

07:28.270 --> 07:31.448
- Well, aren't we gonna launch 'em?
- You can do whatever you want.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.268
- I've gotta go.
- Where?

07:34.372 --> 07:37.988
- You promised we could launch them.
- I'm going shopping with Lori and Linda.

07:38.092 --> 07:40.260
The Lee sisters.

07:40.886 --> 07:43.264
Al, wait! What about the thunderbolt?

07:43.368 --> 07:46.601
Just forget about the thunderbolt.
It's gone.

07:47.540 --> 07:51.021
What do you need her for, anyway?
I mean, what's the big deal?

07:51.856 --> 07:54.400
Well, ever since I burnt
a hole on the roof,

07:54.504 --> 07:58.821
my dad says I can't launch any
of my rockets without supervision.

07:59.238 --> 08:01.480
Hey, I'll supervise.

08:01.584 --> 08:03.847
Hey! You guys, wait for me!

08:03.951 --> 08:05.889
Come on!

08:06.162 --> 08:08.141
Get in the car!

08:30.062 --> 08:33.044
- What are those for?
- Live cargo.

08:33.148 --> 08:36.807
Forget it. Got wet in the trash. Totaled.

08:37.537 --> 08:39.433
How long do you think
they can live without air?

08:39.539 --> 08:43.509
- Hey, man, that's cruel.
- Come on. It's neat.

08:49.894 --> 08:51.100
Glen?

08:53.542 --> 08:55.272
Glen!

09:06.306 --> 09:09.747
It's just irresponsibility. I don't know.

09:09.851 --> 09:12.248
Is it too late to call Mrs. Vandergrift?

09:12.353 --> 09:17.405
Daddy, please, you can't call a baby sitter.
I'm gonna be 16 in wot weeks.

09:17.509 --> 09:20.362
You said I was mature enough
to accept the responsibility.

09:20.466 --> 09:24.406
And, honestly, I promise
there won't be any problems.

09:24.511 --> 09:28.452
Well, what do you think, Glen?
Can you be trusted?

09:28.556 --> 09:29.892
I don't know.

09:29.996 --> 09:34.583
If your father and I agree to let the two
of you stay alone for 3 whole days,

09:34.688 --> 09:38.170
- how can we be sure that you'll behave?
- It was Terry that started it.

09:38.275 --> 09:41.237
If Terry jumped off a bridge,
I suppose you'd jump off, too.

09:41.341 --> 09:43.269
Sure. Why not?

09:43.373 --> 09:46.572
Look, I can take care of Terry
and I can take care of Glen.

09:46.677 --> 09:49.202
I can take care of this house.

09:49.306 --> 09:51.036
Please?

09:53.353 --> 09:57.419
All right. But, you, young man,
are grounded for the weekend.

09:57.523 --> 10:01.277
And that means that you do not leave
this house until we come back.

10:01.381 --> 10:04.342
Grounded? For real?

10:04.447 --> 10:06.344
For real.

10:06.761 --> 10:10.412
And after dinner, pal,
you fill in that hole.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.246
Okay.

10:24.258 --> 10:26.237
Good night, Glen.

10:28.241 --> 10:30.346
No, leave it on.

10:34.498 --> 10:36.179
Glen?

10:36.792 --> 10:39.128
What's with you today?

10:39.232 --> 10:43.277
It's... I don't know.
It's something about that hole.

10:43.798 --> 10:45.696
What do you mean?

10:46.322 --> 10:48.679
I don't know. It's just weird.

10:49.305 --> 10:52.953
Well, you... you filled it in, didn't you?

10:53.058 --> 10:55.675
Yeah. But Terry told me something.

10:55.998 --> 10:58.835
- What?
- Well, he said a long time ago,

10:58.940 --> 11:02.338
when they were building our house,
a workman got killed.

11:02.442 --> 11:04.925
And the other workmen
didn't want to tell the police,

11:05.029 --> 11:07.762
so they sealed him up in one of our walls.

11:08.907 --> 11:10.893
Look, son...

11:11.774 --> 11:14.132
let me tell you something about Terry.

11:14.862 --> 11:17.020
You remember last year
when Terry's mom died.

11:17.124 --> 11:18.939
Yeah.

11:19.043 --> 11:22.347
Well, ever since then,
Terry's been a little strange.

11:24.089 --> 11:27.718
I think he's kind of angry inside
that his mom's gone.

11:28.657 --> 11:33.099
So, you just remember that
when he gets destructive or...

11:33.203 --> 11:35.016
tries to scare you.

11:35.121 --> 11:38.374
I think he's just
a little confused, that's all.

11:39.469 --> 11:42.929
- You know what I'm saying?
- I think so.

11:44.150 --> 11:47.863
- You want me to turn the light on?
- No, it's okay.

11:47.968 --> 11:49.861
Good night, tiger.

11:51.157 --> 11:53.315
- Dad?
- Yeah.

11:55.475 --> 11:57.310
Never mind.

11:57.415 --> 12:00.634
- Good night.
- Good night, pal.

12:56.744 --> 12:59.206
Don't forget that Angus
gets his pills every day.

12:59.310 --> 13:01.895
Make sure they're hidden in his
dog food or he'll spit them out.

13:01.999 --> 13:05.003
- And I don't want him on the furniture.
- I know, Mom.

13:05.107 --> 13:07.712
- Goodbye, hon.
- Bye.

13:08.339 --> 13:11.259
- Bye, Mom.
- Goodbye.

13:11.364 --> 13:13.365
- Bye, Dad.
- See you guys.

13:13.469 --> 13:14.846
- Goodbye!
- Bye!

13:14.951 --> 13:15.805
Bye, Mom.

13:15.909 --> 13:19.369
And don't forget, the numbers
where we'll be are on the refrigerator.

13:19.473 --> 13:23.146
Al, if you need us for any reason,
don't be afraid to give us a call.

13:23.251 --> 13:26.128
- It's just being responsible.
- I know, Mom.

13:26.233 --> 13:28.939
- Remember, you stay in this weekend.
- Okay.

13:29.043 --> 13:32.072
And I want the house clean
when we come home. No parties.

13:32.176 --> 13:34.024
Okay!

13:34.970 --> 13:36.743
Lori! Linda!

13:36.847 --> 13:39.847
Hey, wow! Great party!

13:45.188 --> 13:47.356
I don't know. Here.

13:49.694 --> 13:52.967
What a tool. He just totaled his car.

13:53.071 --> 13:54.323
Brutal!

13:56.492 --> 13:58.973
Hey, somebody get this dog a beer.

14:04.478 --> 14:06.815
Put me down!

14:07.774 --> 14:09.899
Get away!

14:23.749 --> 14:25.707
Come on!

15:04.977 --> 15:08.648
Hey! Bug off, Angus! You stink!

15:08.752 --> 15:11.128
I'd like smell you when you're 97.

15:11.232 --> 15:13.131
He's not 97.

15:13.236 --> 15:15.246
In dog years.

15:21.598 --> 15:22.974
It's just not gonna break.

15:23.079 --> 15:25.236
Why don't we get
the Lee sisters to look at it?

15:25.340 --> 15:27.018
Yeah.

15:28.959 --> 15:33.408
No, we could throw it off the roof
tomorrow. Come on. Let's go party.

15:33.512 --> 15:37.279
- She won't let us.
- Sure she will. Why not?

15:37.384 --> 15:40.073
It's just... forget it.

15:57.633 --> 16:00.755
Told ya. Look at it.

16:03.995 --> 16:06.328
Is it supposed to do that?

16:07.540 --> 16:08.957
I don't know.

16:09.061 --> 16:12.900
Maybe it just got compressed air
when it was being formed or something.

16:19.072 --> 16:21.950
Look. It made some kind of marks.

16:22.054 --> 16:24.455
It's words. What's it say?

16:24.559 --> 16:26.309
It's weird.

16:26.413 --> 16:28.310
"Aca...

16:28.414 --> 16:29.960
"Kuto...

16:30.751 --> 16:32.460
"Alla...

16:32.564 --> 16:34.418
Eta."

17:00.821 --> 17:03.574
He made his way down the dark hallway.

17:03.678 --> 17:05.473
And the squeak keeps getting louder.

17:05.765 --> 17:08.537
And there's also this... like a laugh.

17:11.625 --> 17:14.190
And there's this weird tearing sound.

17:15.127 --> 17:18.710
So she goes to the door
and she opens it really slowly.

17:20.925 --> 17:24.450
And there, in the rocking chair,

17:24.554 --> 17:28.202
is the decomposed corpse
of her dead father.

17:30.185 --> 17:34.899
And in his lap is the severed head
of her boyfriend.

17:35.003 --> 17:38.785
And he's tearing out hair by the handful.

17:40.216 --> 17:42.738
- You made that up.
- I believe it.

17:42.842 --> 17:45.596
- Come on. It's bullshit.
- Weird things happen all the time.

17:45.700 --> 17:50.767
So we make up ghost stories to explain the
powers inside us that we don't understand.

17:51.393 --> 17:55.132
- What kind of powers?
- Well, like...

17:55.772 --> 17:58.985
- Will you guys ever do levitation?
- I've seen that. It's an illusion.

17:59.089 --> 18:03.618
No, it's a matter of concentration.
It really works.

18:04.782 --> 18:07.243
Do you believe in all that stuff?

18:10.393 --> 18:12.290
Me, too.

18:17.169 --> 18:21.046
Now, everyone just... clear your mind.

18:27.471 --> 18:30.683
- You broke your concentration.
- No, I broke my fingernail.

18:30.787 --> 18:34.416
- Too much junk food.
- It doesn't matter. It's not the weight.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.856
Hey, little man, come here.

18:37.273 --> 18:41.901
- Glen, go back to your room.
- No, come here. He'll be all right.

18:45.969 --> 18:49.493
- Let's see if we can levitate him.
- It's a cinch. He's a midget.

18:49.598 --> 18:51.979
- Okay, we'll just use two people.
- Sit down.

18:52.084 --> 18:53.831
Brad.

18:53.935 --> 18:58.398
Okay, hold your arms out, one on top
of the other, and make little circles

18:58.502 --> 19:02.214
to trans... transmit
and stimulate the energy.

19:02.527 --> 19:05.300
And everyone else concentrate.

19:07.657 --> 19:12.266
Now everyone just... clear your minds...

19:13.100 --> 19:16.062
and think of Glen as light as a feather.

19:16.166 --> 19:19.331
Concentrate.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.631
Okay.

19:21.839 --> 19:23.569
Like...

19:23.673 --> 19:25.030
dust...

19:25.134 --> 19:28.532
drifting in front of the windows, like...

19:29.054 --> 19:32.765
dandelions in the breeze.

19:33.329 --> 19:35.725
Rise.

19:36.853 --> 19:38.999
Rise...

19:40.065 --> 19:42.441
Hey. Help!

19:42.545 --> 19:44.963
Come on! Get me down!

19:53.203 --> 19:55.224
Are you okay?

19:58.666 --> 20:00.335
Glen.

20:02.546 --> 20:05.693
Maybe I won't do that... again.

20:07.134 --> 20:08.697
Glen.

20:08.801 --> 20:11.198
Glen, you all right?

20:13.505 --> 20:16.515
I think it's because he cried
in front of everybody.

20:18.395 --> 20:23.337
Hey, Glen... don't be embarrassed.
Crying's nothing.

20:23.963 --> 20:27.843
Remember when Trevor Stubblefield
pantsed me in front of the whole auditorium?

20:27.947 --> 20:32.657
Yeah. And I barfed on Steve Slavit
after the 12-minute run.

20:37.268 --> 20:40.739
- I want to call Mom and Dad.
- Glen, no.

20:40.843 --> 20:43.524
- I want you to call them.
- What am I gonna tell them?

20:43.628 --> 20:46.632
We're scared because we levitated Glen
and he broke the light? Great.

20:46.737 --> 20:49.374
- You must love Mrs. Vandergrift.
- Al...

20:49.478 --> 20:52.001
Look, Terry can sleep over
and keep you company.

20:52.158 --> 20:55.940
Let's all just get some sleep.
I'm gonna lock up.

20:59.435 --> 21:02.062
You really barfed on Steve Slavit?

21:02.167 --> 21:03.938
Yep.

22:51.468 --> 22:54.111
Terry...

22:54.677 --> 22:57.889
I love you.

22:59.453 --> 23:01.201
Mom?

23:03.810 --> 23:06.688
I need you.

23:06.792 --> 23:08.541
Mommy.

23:10.025 --> 23:13.966
I love you.

23:14.071 --> 23:16.595
Terry...

23:16.803 --> 23:18.552
come to me.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.211
Terry...

23:27.315 --> 23:30.272
I've missed you so much.

23:39.846 --> 23:43.036
No. Oh, no.

23:47.896 --> 23:49.875
Oh, no.

23:58.130 --> 24:00.240
The workman.

24:24.579 --> 24:26.498
Angus.

24:27.958 --> 24:29.916
What's going on?

24:59.322 --> 25:01.282
I'm really sorry.

25:01.803 --> 25:04.265
Yeah. He was really old.

25:04.369 --> 25:05.807
Yeah.

25:05.912 --> 25:09.393
He was 97.
They don't live much beyond that.

25:13.386 --> 25:17.002
Well... you want to come over later
and mess around?

25:17.106 --> 25:19.675
Sure. Yeah.

25:20.614 --> 25:22.762
Guess I'll see you later?

25:23.179 --> 25:25.304
See you later.

25:29.018 --> 25:30.701
Dad!

25:41.292 --> 25:43.406
Oh, great.

26:05.784 --> 26:07.702
What'd you do with Angus?

26:07.807 --> 26:11.210
Hey. Don't worry about it.

26:13.938 --> 26:16.294
Aren't you gonna call Mom and Dad?

26:16.399 --> 26:20.758
- No, I'll take care of it.
- Well, if you're not going to, I am.

26:20.863 --> 26:23.355
Glen, Mom and Dad
are gonna be home tomorrow.

26:23.459 --> 26:26.419
I don't care. I want them
to know what happened.

26:27.682 --> 26:29.826
You're not calling them.

26:44.927 --> 26:47.326
- Nice try.
- Fine.

26:47.431 --> 26:50.224
- I'll just call them later.
- What's the matter with him?

26:50.328 --> 26:53.458
- Isn't romper room on today?
- Buzz off, clown face.

26:53.563 --> 26:55.730
Don't you have to go upstairs
and change your pampers or something?

26:55.834 --> 26:59.780
- Don't you have to go and join the circus?
- Hey, you guys, come on.

27:24.718 --> 27:27.385
<i>In a time before the Earth,</i>

27:27.490 --> 27:31.349
<i>before the sun,
and before the light of the stars,</i>

27:31.453 --> 27:34.916
<i>when all was darkness and chaos,</i>

27:35.020 --> 27:38.911
<i>the old gods, the forgotten gods,</i>

27:39.016 --> 27:41.652
<i>ruled the darkness.</i>

27:41.964 --> 27:47.448
<i>But what was theirs now belongs
to the world of light and substance,</i>

27:47.552 --> 27:52.431
<i>and the old gods,
the rightful masters, are jealous,</i>

27:52.535 --> 27:57.041
<i>watching mankind with a hatred
that is as boundless as the stars,</i>

27:57.145 --> 28:01.899
<i>with plans for the destruction of man
that are beyond imagining!</i>

28:06.739 --> 28:12.411
<i>There's a passageway between
our physical world of light, pleasure,</i>

28:12.515 --> 28:16.728
<i>and their spiritual world
of madness and pain.</i>

28:16.833 --> 28:20.502
<i>A gate behind which the demons wait</i>

28:20.606 --> 28:25.152
<i>for the chance
to take back what is theirs!</i>

29:02.503 --> 29:06.299
Eric really likes you.
You've gotta come to the beach with us.

29:06.403 --> 29:08.696
- Well...
- Look, everybody's going.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.424
We're having a bonfire and everything.

29:11.528 --> 29:15.016
I don't know. I mean, I just can't go.

29:15.120 --> 29:18.123
Lookit, just leave him
some Gerber's. He'll be fine.

29:18.227 --> 29:20.959
Al, you can't go out. What about Angus?

29:21.064 --> 29:24.524
What about what happened last night?
You have to call Mom and Dad.

29:24.629 --> 29:27.819
- Glen, cool out.
- What's he talking about?

29:27.924 --> 29:29.392
Tell 'em.

29:31.990 --> 29:34.305
Angus died last night.

29:35.243 --> 29:38.643
- Tell 'em about the other stuff.
- There is no other stuff.

29:38.747 --> 29:43.172
What's the matter with you guys?
Something really scary happened last night.

29:43.700 --> 29:46.265
- What?
- The levitation.

29:46.369 --> 29:48.632
You guys were there.

29:48.736 --> 29:51.365
Hey, little man,
that was just an illusion.

29:51.469 --> 29:53.303
What do you know, lover boy?

29:53.407 --> 29:56.588
- What is your problem?
- You, Alexandra.

29:56.692 --> 30:00.142
- You're acting like a baby.
- Just shut up.

30:00.707 --> 30:03.938
- Fag.
- Hey.

30:05.440 --> 30:07.088
Tres uncool.

30:07.192 --> 30:09.590
- What are we waiting for?
- Look...

30:09.694 --> 30:12.281
You can't back down now. You have to go.

30:12.386 --> 30:15.721
I have to do something about Angus.
Take him to the animal shelter or something.

30:15.826 --> 30:18.140
- Eric will do it.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll do it.

30:18.245 --> 30:21.832
And we'll all go to the mall and get munchies
and stuff and we'll all meet up there.

30:21.936 --> 30:24.110
Come on!

30:26.899 --> 30:29.900
- Don't be too long, Eric!
- Yeah, okay.

30:34.721 --> 30:36.972
- See ya.
- See you at the mall!

30:37.076 --> 30:40.306
Come on, Alexandra. He'll be okay.

32:54.944 --> 32:56.902
Oh, no.

33:21.720 --> 33:24.097
We're in big trouble.

33:24.201 --> 33:26.308
Tell me about it.

33:27.142 --> 33:31.272
- How could it come back by itself?
- I think I know what this means.

33:31.376 --> 33:34.941
You know, with the levitation
and all that other weird stuff?

33:35.671 --> 33:37.403
What?

33:38.133 --> 33:40.257
You got demons.

33:42.178 --> 33:44.869
- Demons?
- Come on.

33:44.973 --> 33:49.123
We better try to cover it up first.
You take this side here.

33:50.896 --> 33:52.794
I don't think this is gonna be enough.

33:52.898 --> 33:56.089
Give me a break. Come on.

33:57.444 --> 33:59.402
Slow down.

34:00.572 --> 34:03.010
How do you know so much about this stuff?

34:05.869 --> 34:08.056
I got something to show you.

34:12.042 --> 34:15.214
Shit! Closed. Sorry, dude.

34:15.690 --> 34:17.978
No vacancies.

34:20.967 --> 34:23.282
They're called sacrifyx,
and my dad brought it from Europe,

34:23.387 --> 34:25.326
and it's got all this stuff in it.

34:25.429 --> 34:28.621
See, these guys are, like,
really serious about demonology.

34:28.725 --> 34:31.038
And it's like they're trying to warn you.

34:32.687 --> 34:36.274
See? These guys knew.
They wrote their own music.

34:36.378 --> 34:39.833
They got their lyrics from this thing
called The Dark Book.

34:39.938 --> 34:41.989
That's like the Bible for demons.

34:42.802 --> 34:46.054
And here's the creepy part.
This is their only album.

34:46.159 --> 34:49.516
And after they made it,
they all died in a plane crash.

34:49.621 --> 34:53.041
- And look at this. Demon Lord.
- Terry, come on.

34:53.146 --> 34:58.401
Wait a minute. See? The lyrics in the album
tell you how to summon the demons.

34:58.505 --> 35:01.654
And there's this certain time
when these constellations are aligned

35:01.758 --> 35:04.472
when you can open the gate
and let the old gods...

35:04.576 --> 35:06.762
those are the demons, come through.

35:06.867 --> 35:09.078
Well, I checked, and it's, like, now.

35:09.183 --> 35:11.247
- Terry, but...
- What?

35:11.351 --> 35:14.753
- Terry, this is a record album.
- But, you see, there are these songs

35:14.857 --> 35:19.233
that tell you about the whole ritual
for opening the gate. We did it.

35:20.589 --> 35:22.279
Here.

35:22.696 --> 35:26.509
Start by reading this aloud.
You know what it means?

35:30.119 --> 35:33.832
"Gods of darkness, breeders of chaos,

35:33.936 --> 35:37.711
"come forth and take possession
of this vile world."

35:37.815 --> 35:41.651
And you need blood.
Remember when you cut yourself?

35:42.069 --> 35:44.218
It's all in here.

35:44.322 --> 35:46.261
The hole...

35:46.678 --> 35:48.346
Okay.

35:48.450 --> 35:50.816
The geode.

35:52.538 --> 35:54.685
And look at this.

35:54.790 --> 35:56.959
The levitation.

35:57.064 --> 35:59.418
What's that supposed to prove?

35:59.774 --> 36:02.110
It proves we're in big trouble.

36:02.945 --> 36:06.740
I didn't tell you about the most
important part of the ritual.

36:06.844 --> 36:08.575
The sacrifice.

36:08.679 --> 36:12.662
- We didn't kill anybody.
- It doesn't have to be a person.

36:13.339 --> 36:14.923
It can be an animal.

36:46.174 --> 36:48.896
Well, then, how come
we haven't seen any demons?

36:49.000 --> 36:52.076
I think it's because
the sacrifice wasn't complete.

36:52.180 --> 36:56.184
If we had put the offering in the hole,
it would have blown the gate wide open.

36:56.601 --> 36:59.105
I think right now
it's like only open a crack.

36:59.209 --> 37:02.462
They can influence us,
but they can't get through.

37:02.567 --> 37:04.402
It's just...

37:04.506 --> 37:06.591
How can this be true?

37:06.695 --> 37:10.134
Wait. You haven't heard anything yet.

37:17.895 --> 37:21.044
- What's this?
- It's the album...

37:21.148 --> 37:23.274
backwards.

37:23.378 --> 37:26.129
It tells you how to close the gates.

38:12.032 --> 38:15.534
"We consecrate this ground,
this world of light.

38:15.639 --> 38:18.539
"We curse the abominations of darkness.

38:18.643 --> 38:22.917
"We block the passage of evil.
May the old devils depart!

38:23.021 --> 38:26.274
"May they burn in the fires
of their own damnation.

38:26.379 --> 38:30.844
"May they freeze in the infinite cold and
darkness of their own hideous creation."

38:31.344 --> 38:35.451
- Isn't that kind of insulting?
- I guess it's supposed to be.

38:35.556 --> 38:37.600
I mean, we're trying to get rid of them.

38:37.705 --> 38:40.994
- Maybe you should do it one more time.
- All right.

38:42.165 --> 38:44.585
Begone, begone, begone!

38:44.690 --> 38:49.039
- Thou art hideous, filth-eating, unspeak...
- What the hell are you doing?

38:50.946 --> 38:53.010
What's under the door?

38:53.115 --> 38:55.679
Hey, did you guys dig in that hole again?

38:57.588 --> 39:00.372
We accidentally summoned demons
who used to rule the universe

39:00.476 --> 39:02.667
to come and take over the world.

39:04.147 --> 39:07.233
Yeah. We found out about it
from one of Terry's albums.

39:07.337 --> 39:09.964
Well, they're gone now.

39:10.068 --> 39:12.800
Well, so what's under the door?

39:24.146 --> 39:26.608
See? They're gone.

39:26.712 --> 39:28.275
It worked.

39:28.379 --> 39:30.473
You guys are weird.

39:31.195 --> 39:33.509
Thought you were going to the beach today.

39:33.614 --> 39:35.991
I was, but I spent all my money.

39:36.095 --> 39:38.012
On what?

39:48.399 --> 39:51.402
Well, are you gonna just stand there
or do you want to launch it?

39:52.862 --> 39:56.030
- Come on.
- All right!

40:03.936 --> 40:05.541
Listen to this.

40:05.646 --> 40:08.877
"Beware, conjurer.
Once set free into our world,

40:08.981 --> 40:11.464
"the power of the old gods is unimaginable

40:11.568 --> 40:15.676
"as they seek 2 human sacrifices
to establish their hell on Earth.

40:15.781 --> 40:19.283
"The ruination of mankind
lurks just beyond the gate.

40:19.387 --> 40:22.704
"The demons can only be destroyed
and the gate closed once again

40:22.809 --> 40:25.600
"by a true spirit of gentle
passions wielding energy

40:25.704 --> 40:28.222
"derived from pure love and light."

40:28.857 --> 40:31.795
Okay. Houston, ready for liftoff.

40:32.483 --> 40:34.800
- Ready?
- Ready.

40:34.904 --> 40:37.010
Ready, Houston.

40:37.323 --> 40:38.823
Okay.

40:40.472 --> 40:45.248
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

40:45.352 --> 40:47.281
Blastoff!

40:47.385 --> 40:50.024
Yeah! All right!

40:50.692 --> 40:52.419
Yeah!

40:54.340 --> 40:56.486
That's the best.

40:58.907 --> 41:02.595
- Who's that?
- Well, there's one way to find out.

41:08.250 --> 41:10.479
Demons aren't gonna ring the doorbell.

41:12.588 --> 41:15.411
Worse. The Lee sisters.

41:18.437 --> 41:21.076
'Cause we got you a great new top,
and I got these new jeans,

41:21.181 --> 41:24.725
Hey... I thought you were
going to the beach tonight.

41:24.829 --> 41:26.935
- We're having a slumber party.
- And you're not invited,

41:27.040 --> 41:31.294
so don't get all retarded on us.
Alexandra, what's your problem?

41:37.196 --> 41:40.574
- Hey, don't touch that.
- I'm just looking at it.

41:40.678 --> 41:44.453
Come on, that's my dad's. Put that down.
He never lets us play with it.

41:44.557 --> 41:47.725
Okay, okay. Don't have a cow.

41:54.817 --> 41:56.713
Way to go.

41:58.081 --> 41:59.830
Here.

42:01.407 --> 42:03.541
The thunderbolt.

42:04.014 --> 42:07.980
- She didn't throw it out.
- Hey, are you guys in bed yet?

42:08.085 --> 42:10.790
Almost. Put it back.

42:15.566 --> 42:17.382
What are you doing?

42:17.486 --> 42:20.550
- Probably fagging off.
- What did you do to your face?

42:20.655 --> 42:22.526
None of your beeswax, four-eyes.

42:22.631 --> 42:26.201
- I think it's a definite improvement.
- Hey, eat your feet, dwarf.

42:26.305 --> 42:29.477
- Suck my nose till my head caves in.
- Why don't you grow up?

42:29.581 --> 42:30.947
- Drop dead.
- Up yours!

42:31.051 --> 42:33.981
- Piss off!
- Why don't you just shut up!

42:34.711 --> 42:36.398
Just go to bed.

42:40.384 --> 42:43.001
Did you ever want a brother
or a sister or anything?

42:43.105 --> 42:44.876
Nope.

43:13.615 --> 43:17.075
Indians. Oh, boy.

43:27.087 --> 43:32.312
"Dark Master, demon
of unimaginable size and power."

43:32.842 --> 43:34.393
Terry?

44:26.709 --> 44:29.816
Terry. Terry.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.108
Are you awake?

45:26.477 --> 45:29.356
Al! Al! They're back!

45:29.460 --> 45:31.440
- The moths came back!
- What? What is it?

45:31.544 --> 45:35.626
- They broke the window! They're in my room!
- What are you talking about?

45:39.636 --> 45:41.825
Oh, my gosh.

45:47.852 --> 45:49.602
Terry?

45:52.586 --> 45:54.694
Hey, Terry, wake up.

45:55.632 --> 45:57.318
Terry!

46:01.867 --> 46:05.413
- Terry?
- What did you do to your hair?

46:11.021 --> 46:12.937
Real cute.

46:25.162 --> 46:27.267
Guys, get over here!

46:27.371 --> 46:30.242
Al, get in! Al!

46:32.084 --> 46:33.765
Get it off of me!

46:44.722 --> 46:47.454
- Go!
- Let's go!

46:48.142 --> 46:50.517
Come on! Hurry!

46:55.274 --> 46:58.048
- Where are we going?
- Run!

46:58.152 --> 47:00.794
Somebody tell me what's going on!

47:03.449 --> 47:05.824
Mom! Dad!

47:10.518 --> 47:13.564
You've been bad!

47:37.302 --> 47:40.025
Glen! Come on!

47:56.231 --> 47:58.285
What are we gonna do?

47:58.389 --> 48:00.295
Back door!

48:04.593 --> 48:06.781
What are we gonna do?

48:07.681 --> 48:09.787
Oh, shoot!

48:09.891 --> 48:13.433
- Hurry up, Al! Hurry up, Al!
- Would you guys shut up?

48:25.885 --> 48:27.990
I don't see anything.

48:31.600 --> 48:33.725
- Come on!
- I'm trying!

48:42.882 --> 48:46.965
- Let me take a look first.
- Good idea.

49:16.395 --> 49:18.917
Al, I think you better come back!

49:19.564 --> 49:21.566
Shut up, you guys!

49:21.670 --> 49:23.255
Al, come back.

49:23.360 --> 49:26.218
What do you want? What is it?

49:28.302 --> 49:30.207
Come on!

49:36.029 --> 49:38.956
- Hurry up!
- Come on, hurry up!

49:41.357 --> 49:43.273
Hurry!

49:44.913 --> 49:46.077
Look.

50:00.299 --> 50:01.962
Are you okay?

50:02.066 --> 50:04.860
- What the hell is going on?
- Somebody knock her out again.

50:04.965 --> 50:07.130
I'm calling the police.

50:11.117 --> 50:13.241
Answer it!

50:31.198 --> 50:32.512
Hello.

50:32.616 --> 50:36.305
<i>You've been bad!</i>

50:47.965 --> 50:51.782
We have to close the gate.
We have to go to the hole and do it right.

50:51.887 --> 50:54.159
You mean, you guys were serious
about that demon stuff?

50:54.263 --> 50:56.576
What does it look like?

50:57.871 --> 51:02.897
- What the hell are you talking about?
- The spells, they're in the basement!

51:03.001 --> 51:05.148
Who's gonna go get them?

51:07.381 --> 51:08.986
Are you sure we can get rid of them?

51:09.090 --> 51:12.281
Yeah. I've got all the spells
and curses to banish the demons.

51:12.385 --> 51:15.972
- Demons? What kind?
- Don't ask.

51:16.076 --> 51:20.060
- How do you know what to do?
- Just trust me. I know what I'm doing.

51:20.164 --> 51:21.893
Right.

51:25.482 --> 51:28.590
- Al.
- What is it?

51:28.694 --> 51:30.616
Forget it.

51:43.437 --> 51:45.375
Over there.

51:48.880 --> 51:51.736
What? Do they hate music?

52:03.249 --> 52:05.709
Great, now what do we do?

52:05.814 --> 52:08.337
- The Bible.
- What?

52:08.441 --> 52:12.101
Prayers. The Bible.
That's what they always use!

52:12.206 --> 52:14.868
These guys are older than the Bible.

52:15.210 --> 52:17.584
Do you have anything better?

52:20.504 --> 52:23.300
- How do we know what to read?
- We'll find something.

52:23.404 --> 52:25.551
Yeah. We went to Sunday school.

52:25.655 --> 52:28.180
We should've called Mom
and Dad before this.

52:28.284 --> 52:32.227
- I wish Mrs. Vandergrift was here.
- It's a little too late for that.

52:32.331 --> 52:35.501
- We found one.
- Good.

52:35.605 --> 52:37.335
Okay.

52:37.752 --> 52:39.690
Let's do it.

52:44.425 --> 52:46.571
The gate's open.

52:47.574 --> 52:49.640
I know it is.

52:49.744 --> 52:52.538
- No, it isn't.
- How do you know, Terry?

52:52.642 --> 52:56.900
'Cause we'd all be dead meat by now.
We'd be the sacrifices.

52:57.004 --> 52:59.817
- Sacrifices?
- I told you.

52:59.921 --> 53:04.571
The demons need two human sacrifices
to stay and make their hell on Earth.

53:06.135 --> 53:07.844
- We don't all have to go.
- Yeah.

53:07.949 --> 53:11.988
Maybe it would be better
if we waited inside.

53:12.725 --> 53:14.909
My heroes.

53:34.935 --> 53:37.248
You've got to be kidding.

53:43.256 --> 53:45.300
I hope this works.

53:45.404 --> 53:47.362
Me, too.

53:50.180 --> 53:52.097
Here it goes.

53:52.723 --> 53:56.340
"Deliver me from my enemies,
father in heaven.

53:56.444 --> 54:00.753
"Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.

54:00.857 --> 54:03.786
And save me from the devils of blood."

54:14.913 --> 54:19.919
"Away from my soul, and return
in evening, they howl like the dog.

54:20.023 --> 54:23.525
"Thou shall bury the evils,
and they will walk the Earth no more.

54:24.464 --> 54:29.417
"Because of thy strength I will wait
for thee, for God is my high tower."

54:34.901 --> 54:36.820
It's working!

54:36.924 --> 54:38.994
Hey, that's pretty good.

54:39.098 --> 54:41.730
Hey. It worked.

54:43.107 --> 54:45.756
- I can still hear them.
- There's one more part here,

54:45.860 --> 54:48.352
- then they should be gone.
- Don't get so close.

54:48.457 --> 54:50.485
- It's okay. It's working.
- Get back!

54:50.589 --> 54:52.914
Don't be such a...

54:57.497 --> 54:59.207
- Terry!
- Terry!

54:59.311 --> 55:01.948
What are we gonna do? Terry!

55:03.731 --> 55:06.639
- Terry!
- Terry!

55:07.382 --> 55:09.907
- Terry!
- Terry!

55:10.011 --> 55:11.716
Hey!

55:16.181 --> 55:17.997
Where is he?

55:18.101 --> 55:20.162
- Hi.
- Hey.

55:36.264 --> 55:40.033
No! Terry! Answer me!

55:40.346 --> 55:43.105
Terry! Answer me!

55:43.209 --> 55:45.002
Help! Glen!

55:48.756 --> 55:51.238
- It's not gonna work!
- Glen! Help me!

55:51.342 --> 55:52.613
Come on!

55:55.228 --> 55:56.671
Let go!

55:58.912 --> 56:00.798
No!

56:15.407 --> 56:18.505
Help! Get me out of here!

56:20.705 --> 56:22.663
Help!

56:24.103 --> 56:26.255
Here he comes!

56:27.149 --> 56:29.273
Get it over here!

56:33.134 --> 56:36.342
- Terry! Grab it!
- Where's the Bible?

56:36.446 --> 56:39.364
- I can't reach it!
- "Deliver me from my enemies,

56:39.469 --> 56:40.527
father in heaven.

56:40.631 --> 56:43.696
- Stop it!
- "Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.

56:43.800 --> 56:47.409
- Glen, stop!
- "The devil's of blood.

56:48.139 --> 56:51.061
- For those who lay...
- Glen, stop it!

56:51.166 --> 56:54.359
- You're making them mad!
- Glen, grab my feet!

56:54.463 --> 56:57.731
- Hurry! I'm falling!
- Get it down here farther!

56:57.835 --> 57:00.839
- Glen, help!
- What are we gonna do?

57:02.361 --> 57:04.696
- Got it!
- Hang on!

57:04.800 --> 57:07.617
- Pull me up!
- Hold it!

57:20.816 --> 57:23.382
- Come on!
- It's closing!

57:28.950 --> 57:31.399
- Hurry!
- Come on!

57:31.503 --> 57:34.523
- Pull!
- Hurry up!

57:34.727 --> 57:37.772
My shoe! I lost my shoe!

57:38.293 --> 57:41.272
Wait... Bible. Where's the Bible?

57:44.111 --> 57:47.489
- I don't know what to read.
- Read anything!

57:52.078 --> 57:56.332
"In the beginning, God created
the heavens and the Earth."

57:56.958 --> 57:58.686
Shit.

58:43.983 --> 58:45.673
- It's gone!
- It's gone?

58:45.777 --> 58:48.799
- It's gone!
- All right!

58:51.511 --> 58:54.408
All right! All right!

58:55.120 --> 58:58.475
Come on, let's go! Yeah!

59:09.770 --> 59:11.395
Hello?

59:20.103 --> 59:21.852
Wait.

59:59.101 --> 01:00:01.122
- It's just us.
- What happened?

01:00:01.227 --> 01:00:04.437
- It worked.
- I knew it.

01:00:05.211 --> 01:00:07.442
- Are you sure?
- No, we're all dead.

01:00:07.546 --> 01:00:10.758
- Welcome to heaven.
- What were you guys doing in there?

01:00:11.646 --> 01:00:13.904
We heard noises.

01:00:20.725 --> 01:00:23.145
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:25.354
Al, what is it?

01:00:39.119 --> 01:00:42.616
- What have you been doing, mud wrestling?
- Not funny.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.149
- What are you doing here?
- Came to party.

01:00:46.481 --> 01:00:48.280
Thought we'd surprise you.

01:00:48.384 --> 01:00:51.549
Well, look, I've had enough
surprises for one night.

01:00:52.696 --> 01:00:56.491
- Could you guys just please leave?
- Come on, Al. Be real.

01:00:56.908 --> 01:01:00.474
- Al, we invited them.
- Well, maybe you should just go with them.

01:01:00.579 --> 01:01:02.205
- Fine.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:06.228
- We can take a hint.
- What a drag.

01:01:10.568 --> 01:01:14.278
- She's just not ready for me yet, guys.
- Oh, shut up.

01:01:19.661 --> 01:01:23.216
Boy, Mom and Dad are gonna
be pissed when they see this.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.113
Yeah. What should we tell 'em?

01:01:28.659 --> 01:01:30.554
Frisbee.

01:01:33.205 --> 01:01:36.688
It's gonna be dawn soon. Why don't
we all clean up and get some sleep?

01:01:36.792 --> 01:01:40.983
Are you kidding?
I'm not gonna sleep for a week.

01:01:41.608 --> 01:01:44.763
- Yeah, come on! Let's go watch some TV.
- Yeah, okay.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:47.554
Well, I'm gonna go get cleaned up.

01:01:47.658 --> 01:01:49.680
- Al?
- Yeah?

01:01:50.201 --> 01:01:53.140
You're better
than Mrs. Vandergrift any day.

01:01:57.437 --> 01:02:01.346
You know, it wouldn't be
so bad to have a sister.

01:02:10.284 --> 01:02:12.619
Wonder if we can still sell it?

01:02:13.037 --> 01:02:14.830
I don't know.

01:02:14.934 --> 01:02:18.258
- Here. Catch.
- Glen!

01:02:18.958 --> 01:02:21.750
Way to go. Terry!

01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:39.153
It's the workman.

01:02:39.386 --> 01:02:41.239
I just made it up.

01:02:54.484 --> 01:02:56.200
No!

01:02:56.789 --> 01:03:00.448
No! No! Let go of me!

01:03:01.196 --> 01:03:03.650
- Glen!
- Terry!

01:03:03.754 --> 01:03:07.684
Glen! No! Glen!

01:03:07.788 --> 01:03:10.365
Glen! Get help!

01:03:10.469 --> 01:03:13.159
Glen! Glen!

01:03:13.263 --> 01:03:14.784
No!

01:03:16.161 --> 01:03:18.325
Glen!

01:03:34.451 --> 01:03:36.307
Al!

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:38.319
Al!

01:04:13.803 --> 01:04:16.283
Al! Al!

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.527
- Let go! Let go!
- Glen! Glen!

01:04:31.631 --> 01:04:33.304
Let go!

01:04:35.033 --> 01:04:36.719
Glen!

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.251
Oh, Glen!

01:05:12.028 --> 01:05:14.842
- What the hell was that?
- It's the workman. It got Terry!

01:05:14.947 --> 01:05:17.492
- The what?
- He just made it up, and it got him.

01:05:17.596 --> 01:05:20.597
- It took him into the wall!
- What do you mean?

01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:25.098
It's the first human sacrifice.

01:05:25.203 --> 01:05:27.188
Dad's gun.

01:05:27.292 --> 01:05:31.186
- It's all my fault.
- Dad's gun! Glen!

01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:33.779
- It's all my fault.
- Go get dad's gun!

01:05:33.883 --> 01:05:35.825
It's all my fault.

01:05:35.929 --> 01:05:37.779
Glen!

01:05:37.883 --> 01:05:40.033
Glen, go!

01:05:42.767 --> 01:05:44.538
Hurry!

01:05:54.174 --> 01:05:57.250
- Hi, it's me, Glen.
- Al!

01:05:57.554 --> 01:05:59.232
Glen!

01:06:00.587 --> 01:06:02.504
Glen!

01:06:04.371 --> 01:06:06.309
Come on!

01:06:08.877 --> 01:06:10.605
Help!

01:06:12.337 --> 01:06:15.236
Help! Al, help!

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.403
Get him off of me!

01:06:20.913 --> 01:06:23.276
Al, the rope. Help me!

01:06:23.766 --> 01:06:25.579
Al, help me!

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:48.916
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Close the door!

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:50.752
Hurry!

01:06:52.524 --> 01:06:54.340
Hurry!

01:06:55.174 --> 01:06:58.007
- Where's the gun?
- Over there!

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:06.518
Did Terry say that there was
some way we could kill them?

01:07:06.622 --> 01:07:10.040
Energy derived from... I can't remember!

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:17.547
Shit!

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.153
Hey!

01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:51.020
- Leave her alone!
- Glen! Let me go!

01:07:51.479 --> 01:07:54.357
No! Let me go! No!

01:07:55.754 --> 01:07:58.088
Let me go!

01:08:04.596 --> 01:08:06.805
Al!

01:08:07.996 --> 01:08:11.891
Let me go! Please! No! No!

01:08:11.996 --> 01:08:15.295
- Glen! Please!
- No!

01:08:15.399 --> 01:08:17.274
Glen!

01:08:24.138 --> 01:08:26.743
The second human sacrifice.

01:08:43.635 --> 01:08:47.542
Love and light. That's it!
The thunderbolt!

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:51.330
Energy derived from...

01:09:50.036 --> 01:09:52.036
Come on! Where is it?

01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:57.687
Come on!

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:31.319
Please.

01:13:46.125 --> 01:13:48.252
Hell on Earth.

01:15:06.123 --> 01:15:08.042
No!

01:15:08.146 --> 01:15:12.108
Come back here! Take me instead!

01:15:12.213 --> 01:15:14.214
I'm next!

01:15:14.318 --> 01:15:16.466
Don't you want another sacrifice?

01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:20.408
Come back! Take me instead!

01:15:20.513 --> 01:15:24.097
Come back. Come back.

01:16:21.447 --> 01:16:22.856
Glen!

01:16:23.690 --> 01:16:25.856
Help us!

01:16:27.824 --> 01:16:29.372
Glen!

01:16:30.206 --> 01:16:31.935
Help us!

01:18:18.523 --> 01:18:22.295
Happy Birthday, Al!

01:18:29.159 --> 01:18:30.930
Yeah!

01:20:52.605 --> 01:20:54.314
Angus!

01:20:55.493 --> 01:20:57.410
Oh, Angus.

01:20:58.100 --> 01:20:59.998
Good boy.

01:21:00.102 --> 01:21:01.831
Angus.

01:21:07.066 --> 01:21:08.138
Al!

01:21:09.341 --> 01:21:11.133
Glen!

01:21:11.237 --> 01:21:12.560
Glen!

01:21:17.182 --> 01:21:18.932
Glen.

01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:22.279
- Angus!
- Terry.

01:21:27.421 --> 01:21:28.867
All right.

01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:52.342
Think they'll notice?

01:21:52.446 --> 01:21:54.008
Give me a break.

01:21:58.441 --> 01:22:00.900
You're my best buddies.
