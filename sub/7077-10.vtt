WEBVTT

00:01.862 --> 00:03.644
It's open!

00:03.645 --> 00:08.166
Look at us. Our group's
first grown-up Christmas party.

00:08.167 --> 00:10.051
Thanks for hosting.
I hope you don't mind.

00:10.052 --> 00:11.753
I brought a few things
just to make the place

00:11.754 --> 00:14.405
look a little less short-term
corporate housing.

00:14.406 --> 00:16.724
<i>Oh, well,
mi casa es su art project.</i>

00:16.725 --> 00:18.292
Cool.

00:18.293 --> 00:21.396
Figured
just a little something there,

00:21.397 --> 00:23.598
a little zhuzh right there.

00:23.599 --> 00:26.217
Just a few things
to add a little Annie.

00:26.218 --> 00:27.985
Annie, do we have to have
another talk

00:27.986 --> 00:29.654
about you wanting
to play house with me?

00:29.655 --> 00:33.991
Sha.
Sha-na-not.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.244
I'm just decorating
for a party.

00:36.245 --> 00:39.213
Oh, I saw these curtains,
and I couldn't resist.

00:39.214 --> 00:40.715
Let's just live with them
for a night.

00:40.716 --> 00:43.317
We can totally return them.
Oh, let's totally return them.

00:43.318 --> 00:46.854
Jeff.
Live with them for one night.

00:46.855 --> 00:49.824
Actually, these will also work
for Valentine's day,

00:49.825 --> 00:51.692
presidents day,
whenever people get to see it.

00:51.693 --> 00:55.797
Annie, what is this?

00:55.798 --> 00:58.266
Oh.
I know we said no gifts,

00:58.267 --> 01:00.468
but I couldn't resist.

01:00.469 --> 01:02.353
You realize you've just put
your friends

01:02.354 --> 01:03.521
in a very awkward position.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.957
A gift creates obligation.

01:05.958 --> 01:07.358
I don't see it that way.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.594
Well, I do, and I think
the others will too.

01:09.595 --> 01:11.512
Merry Christmas.

01:11.513 --> 01:13.581
I know we said no gifts,
but I couldn't resist.

01:13.582 --> 01:15.917
Oh, who couldn't have seen
that coming?

01:15.918 --> 01:17.585
Oh, Annie, I love
what you did with the place.

01:17.586 --> 01:19.854
It's a work in progress.

01:19.855 --> 01:22.440
Good tidings,
fellow Christmas celebrators.

01:22.441 --> 01:23.991
And to all a good wassailing.

01:23.992 --> 01:26.344
I know we said no gifts,
but we couldn't resist.

01:26.345 --> 01:30.398
There's a real problem
with resistance in this group.

01:30.399 --> 01:31.966
Hi.
Thank you all so much

01:31.967 --> 01:33.935
for inviting me
to my first Christmas.

01:33.936 --> 01:37.655
Oh, Annie explained to me that
"no gifts" means "bring gifts."

01:37.656 --> 01:40.041
I'm getting it.
No means yes.

01:41.894 --> 01:44.094
So this is Christmas.
Just this.

01:44.095 --> 01:46.547
<i>I was hoping we could do
a Die Hard in a restaurant.</i>

01:46.548 --> 01:47.665
There's a place
called Nakatomi Sushi.

01:47.666 --> 01:49.901
I hear the Hans Grouper
is to die for.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.118
Come on, people, it's all
spelled out in your evites.

01:51.119 --> 01:53.404
I know you opened them.
Oh, I brought gifts.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.506
Does Annie live here now?

01:55.507 --> 01:59.293
Okay.
Now that we're all here...

01:59.294 --> 02:01.262
Oh, wait.
Where's Pierce?

02:01.263 --> 02:03.214
Oh, sensitivity training
with Gilbert.

02:03.215 --> 02:05.516
<i>Apparently watching Invictus
didn't do the trick.</i>

02:05.517 --> 02:06.818
Oh. Okay.

02:06.819 --> 02:08.336
Well, now that we are all here,

02:08.336 --> 02:11.989
I have some good news
and some bad news.

02:11.990 --> 02:14.041
Great.
Black licorice?

02:14.042 --> 02:15.176
I have to start
with the bad news.

02:15.177 --> 02:16.978
It's about our history paper.

02:16.979 --> 02:20.231
I heard through back channels
we got a failing grade.

02:20.232 --> 02:22.233
- What?
- Kendra told me.

02:22.234 --> 02:23.918
She does assistant work
for Professor cornwallis.

02:23.919 --> 02:25.820
I'll bet she does.

02:25.821 --> 02:27.572
We failed?
This is terrible.

02:27.573 --> 02:29.457
I need that paper to graduate.

02:29.458 --> 02:31.008
Who screwed up their section?

02:31.009 --> 02:32.777
- Jeff, it doesn't matter.
- No, it matters to me.

02:32.778 --> 02:35.196
I want to know who cost me
my early graduation.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.131
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- I worked really hard.

02:37.132 --> 02:39.433
Guys, there's no need
to point fingers,

02:39.434 --> 02:41.202
because I haven't told you
the good news.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.037
I invited the Professor
to our party tonight.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.805
- Annie!
- What? How is that better?

02:44.806 --> 02:46.691
No, no, Annie's right.
This could work.

02:46.692 --> 02:48.776
I mean, the grade isn't etched
in stone.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.828
I mean, these British guys
like to socialize

02:50.829 --> 02:51.879
with their students.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.564
We just need to show him
a good time,

02:53.565 --> 02:55.233
laugh at his jokes,

02:55.234 --> 02:57.235
love whatever he loves,
and by the end of the night

02:57.236 --> 03:00.004
I bet you we can get that grade
back up to a "c."

03:00.005 --> 03:00.988
Who knows?
Maybe even an "a."

03:00.989 --> 03:02.490
Or something realistic.

03:02.491 --> 03:04.191
And just like that
our pleasant holiday party

03:04.192 --> 03:06.327
turned into a tense,
high-stakes secret mission.

03:06.328 --> 03:08.613
No costumes.
No funny voices.

03:08.614 --> 03:10.248
- Oh.
- Okay.

03:10.249 --> 03:11.732
But, for the purpose
of story symmetry,

03:11.733 --> 03:14.201
I suggest we wait here silently
until the Professor arrives.

03:14.202 --> 03:15.753
It's the only real plot point
we need next.

03:21.026 --> 03:22.426
Oh, what...

03:51.340 --> 03:52.840
Hi!

03:52.841 --> 03:54.809
I'm sorry.
I can't stay long.

03:54.810 --> 03:56.560
I've got my daughter in town.

03:56.561 --> 03:57.812
Didn't want to appear rude.

03:57.813 --> 04:01.165
Was I expected to bring a gift?

04:01.166 --> 04:04.719
No.
Nor was anyone else.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.304
Can I show you around,
starting with the bar?

04:06.305 --> 04:08.556
A lovely place.
Very feminine.

04:08.557 --> 04:12.143
Did you hear him
use "feminine" as an insult?

04:12.144 --> 04:14.478
Typical phallo-centric
worldview.

04:14.479 --> 04:16.613
I bet he gave us
a failing grade

04:16.615 --> 04:18.349
because he could tell my section

04:18.350 --> 04:20.451
was written
by a strong, independent...

04:20.452 --> 04:22.637
Would you excuse me?
I've just seen an old friend.

04:22.638 --> 04:25.289
Hurry back soon.

04:25.290 --> 04:28.476
Hey, Abed,
got you an early Christmas gift.

04:28.477 --> 04:31.078
<i>I know you were bummed about not
doing Die Hard in a restaurant.</i>

04:31.079 --> 04:34.348
And your recent divorce.

04:34.349 --> 04:36.934
Yippee-ki-yay, Father Christmas.

04:36.935 --> 04:38.452
I tried to get you
"taking off shoes,"

04:38.453 --> 04:39.503
but I didn't know
how to wrap it.

04:39.504 --> 04:41.038
John McClane's tank top?

04:41.039 --> 04:43.641
You're getting really good
at Christmas, Troy.

04:43.642 --> 04:45.359
Ooh, things
I've never seen before.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.560
It's Macallan Eighteen.

04:46.561 --> 04:48.746
I like to serve it neat
if that's okay with you?

04:48.747 --> 04:49.997
What, in America?

04:49.998 --> 04:51.999
Don't you mix it
with cherry pop

04:52.000 --> 04:54.168
or Monterey Jack cheese?

04:54.169 --> 04:56.687
Professor,
these are melon slices with ham.

04:56.688 --> 04:58.339
And asparagus
wrapped in salmon.

04:58.340 --> 05:01.292
I see somebody's
been attempting tapas.

05:01.293 --> 05:02.710
Oh, that would be me.

05:02.711 --> 05:04.912
I think cuisine is like
a window into history.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.881
I believe it was the hun...

05:06.882 --> 05:09.433
Actually, you know,
I was talking to the ladies.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.818
Oh.

05:10.819 --> 05:13.371
Well, I'll let... I'll leave
you three be, all right?

05:13.372 --> 05:14.872
Britta.

05:14.873 --> 05:17.808
Look, the Professor
seems to be responding

05:17.809 --> 05:19.326
to things that I don't have,

05:19.327 --> 05:20.961
so you gotta get in there
and jiggle something.

05:20.962 --> 05:22.263
He hates me.

05:22.264 --> 05:23.931
He called me Broken Barbie
all year.

05:23.932 --> 05:25.599
Well, we're all gonna have
to work it

05:25.600 --> 05:27.985
if we're gonna get
that grade changed.

05:27.986 --> 05:29.970
Be honest.
Your section sucked, right?

05:29.971 --> 05:33.324
No way. I read an entire book
on the Peloponnesian War.

05:33.325 --> 05:35.159
Wow.
You pronounced it right.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.894
Then someone else
had to tank it

05:36.895 --> 05:38.095
for us to get that "f."

05:38.096 --> 05:40.748
Someone else?

05:40.749 --> 05:42.583
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yeah.

05:42.584 --> 05:45.269
- I blew my section off.
- What?

05:45.270 --> 05:47.605
Well, there was
a secret Tom Waits show in town,

05:47.606 --> 05:48.772
so I did the math.

05:48.773 --> 05:50.124
There's seven sections
to the paper.

05:50.125 --> 05:52.543
Annie gets an "a,"
Pierce buys his from Neil,

05:52.544 --> 05:53.728
so that's solid.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.246
And then you guys get
"b"s and "c"s,

05:55.247 --> 05:57.331
so, I figured
if my section gets an "f,"

05:57.332 --> 05:59.734
the worst we could end up
with is a "c-minus."

05:59.735 --> 06:01.202
So you just left
your section blank?

06:01.203 --> 06:02.853
No, of course not.

06:02.854 --> 06:04.788
<i>I copied and pasted the lyrics
to war, what is it good for?</i>

06:04.789 --> 06:06.190
- Good God.
- Shh.

06:06.191 --> 06:08.559
Your friends
were counting on you.

06:08.560 --> 06:09.726
Well, that's their fault.

06:09.727 --> 06:11.128
I have carefully cultivated

06:11.129 --> 06:13.547
a persona that screams,
"you're on your own."

06:13.548 --> 06:15.966
That's my judgey face.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.485
Noted.
I'll make it right.

06:17.486 --> 06:19.870
I'm going back in.

06:21.373 --> 06:23.541
How's it going?
Well, he asked me to get

06:23.542 --> 06:25.693
my fit bum to the kitchen
for a refill,

06:25.694 --> 06:26.794
so that's good, right?

06:26.795 --> 06:28.162
Kevin's showing him
a card trick.

06:28.163 --> 06:31.248
What?
Oh, God.

06:31.249 --> 06:32.316
Is this a card?

06:32.317 --> 06:34.018
No, it isn't.
Queen of Hearts.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.603
No, I'm asking, is this a card?

06:35.604 --> 06:37.872
Hey, Kevin, did you know
that we have bubble wrap?

06:37.873 --> 06:40.091
- What?
- Poppy poppy paper.

06:40.092 --> 06:43.194
I so enjoy that.
Do you mind if I pop some?

06:43.195 --> 06:44.261
Oh, go crazy.

06:44.262 --> 06:45.780
Changnesia.

06:45.781 --> 06:48.165
I mean,
why do you indulge that idiot?

06:48.166 --> 06:50.000
Oh, I, too, was skeptical
at first,

06:50.001 --> 06:52.186
but now I actually have
some sympathy.

06:52.187 --> 06:53.471
I believe
it was tacitus who said...

06:53.472 --> 06:55.939
You know, Mr. Winger,
your pathetic attempts

06:55.940 --> 06:58.092
to suck up to me
are a wee bit transparent.

06:58.093 --> 07:00.261
I mean, I can only surmise
that it's something to do

07:00.262 --> 07:02.580
with the "c-minus" I gave you
for that final paper.

07:02.581 --> 07:04.331
"C-minus"?

07:04.332 --> 07:06.283
Oh, thank you.
Is this the...

07:06.284 --> 07:07.668
If you'll excuse us.

07:07.669 --> 07:09.587
Annie, he's giving us
a "c-minus."

07:09.588 --> 07:11.038
- Right.
- A "c-minus"

07:11.039 --> 07:12.122
is not a failing grade.

07:12.123 --> 07:13.457
To me, it is.

07:13.458 --> 07:14.809
I'm on a Valedictorian track,

07:14.810 --> 07:17.995
and a "c-minus" means I fail
to get Valedictorian.

07:17.996 --> 07:19.630
You ruined our Christmas dinner

07:19.631 --> 07:21.331
so you could be crowned
the smartest person

07:21.332 --> 07:22.600
at the dumbest school?

07:22.601 --> 07:23.684
Look, the only reason I agreed

07:23.685 --> 07:26.036
to kiss
that pompous anglo's ass

07:26.037 --> 07:27.771
was because I thought
we were getting an "f."

07:27.772 --> 07:29.340
Good news, Mr. Winger.

07:29.341 --> 07:31.725
You may remove your lips
from my buttocks,

07:31.726 --> 07:33.511
because you have
in fact succeeded

07:33.512 --> 07:34.728
in changing your grade.

07:34.729 --> 07:36.780
It's now an "f."
What?

07:36.781 --> 07:38.482
You're "f" -ing us?

07:38.483 --> 07:41.402
Professor, if you could
just give us a minute,

07:41.403 --> 07:43.270
this has been
a terrible misunderstanding,

07:43.271 --> 07:47.090
and I'm sure we can get
this whole thing sorted out.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.043
Bedroom.
Now.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.913
Jeff just got us an "f."

07:52.914 --> 07:55.249
- I thought we had an "f."
- No, we were lied to.

07:55.250 --> 07:57.000
This isn't fun.
That guy's creepy.

07:57.001 --> 07:58.135
Yeah, if there's
a human version

07:58.136 --> 07:59.386
of Scrooge McDuck,
this guy is it.

07:59.387 --> 08:00.387
This wouldn't have happened

08:00.388 --> 08:01.856
if Jeff hadn't taunted him.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.524
No, it wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't decided

08:03.525 --> 08:05.142
a "c-minus" isn't good enough.

08:05.143 --> 08:06.977
When are you gonna grow up
and realize

08:06.978 --> 08:08.612
that grades don't matter
outside of school?

08:08.613 --> 08:10.514
That's a lie they tell
dumb people

08:10.515 --> 08:12.032
when they're fitting them
for work boots.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.450
All we needed
was a passing grade,

08:13.451 --> 08:16.370
and we had it until you
dragged us into this mess.

08:18.323 --> 08:19.740
- Judgey face.
- All right.

08:19.741 --> 08:21.325
I will talk to him, man to man,

08:21.326 --> 08:22.993
and try to get
our "c-minus" back.

08:22.994 --> 08:24.211
Ah!

08:24.212 --> 08:25.546
Annie, it's the best
we can do right now.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.414
Let me handle this.
Let go of me,

08:27.415 --> 08:29.383
you big, hairy nutter!

08:30.835 --> 08:32.285
I'm proving my worth
to you guys.

08:32.287 --> 08:35.005
Do you want me to kill him?

08:37.729 --> 08:40.246
- Kevin bad!
- I have Changnesia.

08:40.246 --> 08:41.429
I'm not a dog.

08:41.431 --> 08:43.966
Professor, we're so sorry.

08:43.967 --> 08:45.985
Obviously,
Kevin made a mistake.

08:45.986 --> 08:47.153
Or did he?

08:47.154 --> 08:48.704
Why are you
"or did he" -ing him?

08:48.705 --> 08:51.223
I'm just saying the Professor
can't get any more tied up,

08:51.224 --> 08:53.175
and we can't get any less
than an "f,"

08:53.176 --> 08:55.611
so let's just take a beat
and think this through.

08:55.612 --> 08:58.264
<i>Okay, this is way better
than Die Hard in a restaurant.</i>

08:58.265 --> 09:00.983
So what exactly
is your plan here, Mr. Winger?

09:00.984 --> 09:03.569
I mean, I'm certainly
not gonna change your grade,

09:03.570 --> 09:06.338
and it'll take several days
to starve me

09:06.339 --> 09:09.425
as I really loaded up
on that dreadful tapas.

09:09.426 --> 09:11.777
Oh, but you already
have changed it, Professor.

09:11.778 --> 09:13.012
You just dropped it to an "f,"

09:13.013 --> 09:15.214
thereby proving the work
on the page

09:15.215 --> 09:16.982
is not the only factor
you consider.

09:16.983 --> 09:19.368
And now, thanks to Kevin's
complete misreading

09:19.369 --> 09:22.121
of the situation, we have
our moment of maximum leverage,

09:22.122 --> 09:24.256
so let's just talk
about this "f."

09:24.257 --> 09:27.526
Maybe it can come up
to a "c-minus," or, who knows,

09:27.527 --> 09:29.278
perhaps an "a."

09:29.279 --> 09:31.147
This is actually a felony.

09:31.148 --> 09:33.449
I mean, I will call the police,

09:33.450 --> 09:35.384
and you will all go to jail.

09:35.385 --> 09:37.253
Let me explain to you
why you won't do that.

09:37.254 --> 09:39.004
First, he's tied up.

09:39.005 --> 09:40.622
First, you're tied up,
and second,

09:40.623 --> 09:42.725
who can really be sure
what happened in this apartment?

09:42.726 --> 09:44.426
Maybe you attacked one of us.

09:44.427 --> 09:47.062
Oh, really?
Where are the signs of struggle?

09:48.498 --> 09:49.849
- Oh.
- You were full of scotch

09:49.850 --> 09:51.434
when things took a dark turn.

09:51.435 --> 09:54.570
We'd all heard
about your troubles with co-eds

09:54.571 --> 09:55.737
back at Oxford,

09:55.738 --> 09:59.041
but it was becoming
all too real.

09:59.042 --> 10:01.210
As you lumbered around the room,
we had to assume

10:01.211 --> 10:03.629
you were coming after me
or Britta.

10:03.630 --> 10:04.697
Ah-ah-ahem!

10:04.698 --> 10:05.914
Or Shirley,

10:05.915 --> 10:07.817
who I didn't mention earlier,

10:07.818 --> 10:10.236
because she intimidates you
sexually.

10:10.237 --> 10:12.671
- Thank you.
- Point being,

10:12.672 --> 10:14.957
let's just take the idea
of the police

10:14.958 --> 10:16.859
off the table, shall we,
Professor?

10:16.860 --> 10:18.911
Fine. You think you can hold
this group together

10:18.912 --> 10:20.930
without anyone cracking?

10:20.931 --> 10:22.331
Oh, we're solid.

10:22.332 --> 10:25.951
Empires are always destroyed
from within.

10:25.952 --> 10:27.853
And I can prove it to you

10:27.854 --> 10:30.489
from the comparative comfort
of this tacky chair.

10:30.490 --> 10:32.858
I will give an "a" right now

10:32.859 --> 10:35.244
to the first person
that unties me.

10:35.245 --> 10:36.412
The rest of you will fail.

10:39.466 --> 10:40.599
Stay where you are.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.583
This is amazing

10:41.584 --> 10:42.935
and possibly all in real time.

10:42.936 --> 10:45.187
Everybody, stop it.
No one listen to him.

10:45.188 --> 10:47.656
The Professor's job
is to make us turn

10:47.657 --> 10:48.974
on one another.
We hold all the cards

10:48.975 --> 10:51.277
as long as we stay united.

10:51.278 --> 10:52.862
And, Kevin, you're one of us.

10:52.863 --> 10:55.097
- Thank you.
- All right.

10:55.098 --> 10:58.517
Who will be the betrayer...

10:58.518 --> 11:01.187
the type-a lolita,

11:01.188 --> 11:04.039
the put-upon housewife...
Is that me?

11:04.040 --> 11:07.543
Or how about you,
the odd, emotionless Muslim?

11:07.544 --> 11:09.512
I mean, come on,
you don't deserve an "f."

11:09.513 --> 11:11.897
And you know that,
because of your impairment,

11:11.898 --> 11:14.133
they'll forgive you anyway.

11:14.134 --> 11:16.168
All true, but I'm probably
not your best target.

11:16.169 --> 11:17.803
If you don't mind,
I'd like to get some popcorn.

11:17.804 --> 11:19.355
Typically, it takes a while
for villains to ramp up.

11:19.356 --> 11:21.323
Promise not to monologue
till I get back?

11:21.324 --> 11:23.792
Give it up, Professor.
You got nothing.

11:23.793 --> 11:25.461
Oh, I've got plenty.

11:25.462 --> 11:27.195
Why don't we just let him go
and be done with this?

11:27.196 --> 11:28.964
It's Christmas.
We have gifts to unwrap.

11:28.965 --> 11:31.466
Don't you see? We can't now
or someone will get the "a."

11:31.467 --> 11:32.768
No one wants to screw the group.

11:32.769 --> 11:34.036
Oh, you see that, Professor?

11:34.037 --> 11:35.671
Your offer
actually made it harder

11:35.672 --> 11:37.072
for you to get untied,

11:37.073 --> 11:39.024
because no one wants
to be the betrayer.

11:39.025 --> 11:42.244
Beware the ides of march,
Mr. Winger.

11:42.245 --> 11:44.947
Everyone wants to be
the betrayer.

11:44.948 --> 11:47.099
What the hell is your game?

11:47.100 --> 11:49.885
I'm trying
to teach you history.

11:49.886 --> 11:53.489
Your failure will be the same
as any self-obsessed nation.

11:53.490 --> 11:55.791
You only care about each other
when you're winning.

11:55.792 --> 11:57.626
The Romans loved Rome

11:57.627 --> 11:59.245
when it was raping
half the world,

11:59.246 --> 12:01.647
but when Hannibal
came charging over the Alps,

12:01.648 --> 12:03.482
the Romans turned on themselves

12:03.483 --> 12:06.769
as quickly as you can say,
"e pluribus unum."

12:06.770 --> 12:09.171
I'm pretty sure it's "anus."

12:09.172 --> 12:12.224
Usually, the cracks are hidden
within the alliances.

12:12.225 --> 12:13.392
So let's see.

12:13.393 --> 12:14.893
In any group of seven,

12:14.894 --> 12:17.980
there's bound to be
some romantic entanglements.

12:17.981 --> 12:21.050
See, I've noticed
that the damaged blonde

12:21.051 --> 12:23.102
is dating
the childish black one,

12:23.103 --> 12:26.438
I wonder, does anyone
take issue with that pairing?

12:26.439 --> 12:27.740
You're fishing, Professor.
No one has anything

12:27.741 --> 12:29.241
against Britta and Troy dating.

12:29.242 --> 12:30.359
And that's coming from Jeff,

12:30.360 --> 12:32.461
and we used to date, so...

12:32.462 --> 12:34.597
Britta, information is ammo.

12:34.598 --> 12:36.181
And what we did was not dating.

12:36.182 --> 12:38.433
- Uh.
- Ah. A little friction.

12:38.434 --> 12:39.952
That usually indicates heat.

12:39.953 --> 12:41.570
Heat?
There's no heat.

12:41.571 --> 12:43.405
If there was heat,
I'd be nervous,

12:43.406 --> 12:44.873
and, if I was nervous,
I'd be rambling,

12:44.874 --> 12:47.226
and I'm definitely not rambling,
so there's no heat.

12:47.227 --> 12:49.061
Ah, well, I think
we found our triangle.

12:49.062 --> 12:51.897
Thank you
and welcome to the party, Troy.

12:51.898 --> 12:53.582
He knows my name.

12:53.583 --> 12:55.250
Guys, keep it together.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:05.228 --> 13:06.979
I missed something great,
didn't I?

13:06.980 --> 13:08.414
Enough.
It's time to stop arsing about

13:08.415 --> 13:09.715
and get serious.

13:09.716 --> 13:11.800
So let's hear it
from the one person

13:11.801 --> 13:14.336
who needs that "a" the most

13:14.337 --> 13:17.473
and can't possibly abide
by an "f,"

13:17.474 --> 13:22.127
the one person on pace
to become class Valedictorian.

13:22.128 --> 13:24.480
I would never turn
against the group.

13:24.481 --> 13:26.298
I'm not talking
about you, miss Edison.

13:26.299 --> 13:28.517
What?
Abed?

13:28.518 --> 13:30.636
Jeff?
Is it me?

13:30.637 --> 13:32.154
Oh, my God, Britta?

13:32.155 --> 13:34.189
First of all, it's me,
and, second of all,

13:34.190 --> 13:35.374
you put Britta ahead of me?

13:35.375 --> 13:36.742
None taken.

13:36.743 --> 13:38.026
Oh, my God, Shirley.

13:38.027 --> 13:39.628
Why didn't you ever tell me
about it?

13:39.629 --> 13:41.380
I didn't think
it was a competition.

13:41.381 --> 13:43.498
Oh, of course
you'd play it that way

13:43.499 --> 13:44.800
so I wouldn't be expecting...

13:44.801 --> 13:47.820
A church-going mother of three
to be smart, huh?

13:47.821 --> 13:51.139
So, miss Edison,
it's decision time, isn't it?

13:51.140 --> 13:52.808
Annie, don't listen to him.

13:52.809 --> 13:55.711
You know you can't make
Valedictorian with an "f,"

13:55.712 --> 13:59.164
and you can eliminate your
competition in one easy step.

13:59.165 --> 14:01.917
What else do you have
to lose, my dear?

14:01.918 --> 14:04.803
I mean, these people,
they're not here to support you.

14:04.804 --> 14:08.741
I mean, they already hate you
for this disaster of a party.

14:08.742 --> 14:10.142
Not this guy.

14:10.143 --> 14:12.761
No.
I can't.

14:12.762 --> 14:15.364
Give it up, Professor.
You've fired all your bullets.

14:15.365 --> 14:18.650
No, I've got
one more bullet left,

14:18.651 --> 14:21.203
and it's a doozy.

14:21.204 --> 14:23.172
Mr. Winger, would you like
to tell your friends

14:23.173 --> 14:26.458
why they did so poorly
on this paper,

14:26.459 --> 14:27.609
or shall I?

14:27.610 --> 14:29.278
- Jeff?
- Jeff?

14:29.279 --> 14:30.445
Jeffrey.

14:32.582 --> 14:33.766
I tanked my section.

14:33.767 --> 14:35.501
I knew you guys
would all work hard,

14:35.502 --> 14:37.219
so I just coasted.

14:37.220 --> 14:38.504
Tom Waits was...
Ah!

14:38.505 --> 14:41.006
- Ow.
- You cost me Valedictorian.

14:41.007 --> 14:43.291
He cost me Valedictorian.
That was my punch.

14:47.897 --> 14:49.631
Tom waits!

14:51.451 --> 14:53.819
Oh, my God.

14:53.820 --> 14:56.105
Jeff, do you have
any milk duds?

15:01.014 --> 15:02.414
Jeffrey, I know
you're in there.

15:02.415 --> 15:05.034
I can smell you.

15:05.035 --> 15:06.351
Did I have the game on
too loud?

15:06.352 --> 15:07.419
Is everything okay?

15:07.420 --> 15:09.004
I was just spending an evening

15:09.005 --> 15:11.206
with my two irresistible lady
friends, Rizzoli and Isles,

15:11.207 --> 15:12.775
when I heard...
wait a minute.

15:12.776 --> 15:14.410
What the hell
is going on in here?

15:14.411 --> 15:16.011
- No, don't!
- I can explain.

15:17.180 --> 15:18.764
No explanation necessary.

15:18.765 --> 15:22.534
Next time you decide to have
a party without me, Jeffrey,

15:22.535 --> 15:25.170
at least have the decency
to do it when I'm in spin class.

15:26.690 --> 15:30.476
I'm a blast
at holiday-themed parties.

15:30.477 --> 15:33.495
- Where the hell is he?
- Professor? Did he leave?

15:33.496 --> 15:35.414
Why in God's name
would I leave?

15:36.683 --> 15:37.900
This is just getting
interesting.

15:37.901 --> 15:41.020
Now, one of you untied me.

15:41.021 --> 15:43.272
I wonder who it was.

15:43.273 --> 15:45.541
Who is the Benedict Arnold,

15:45.542 --> 15:47.409
the true hero of this story?

15:47.410 --> 15:49.861
Oh, no, what's gonna happen
when we find out

15:49.862 --> 15:52.548
who betrayed us?
I wonder why you're so scared.

15:52.549 --> 15:53.849
It wasn't me.

15:53.850 --> 15:55.734
Can we just say
a ghost did it again?

15:55.735 --> 15:58.587
We're gonna find out who
did it when we get our grade.

15:58.588 --> 16:00.439
No, we'll have to find out now.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.507
Otherwise,
the lesson isn't complete.

16:02.508 --> 16:04.910
But the lesson
is complete, Professor.

16:04.911 --> 16:06.078
You know what you taught us
tonight?

16:06.079 --> 16:07.563
That, yes, empires fall,

16:07.564 --> 16:09.681
but we're no empire.

16:09.682 --> 16:12.351
We're just a bunch
of flawed, selfish people.

16:12.352 --> 16:13.485
And that's not our weakness.

16:13.486 --> 16:14.920
It's our strength.

16:14.921 --> 16:17.122
The one thing
that we can count on

16:17.123 --> 16:18.724
at any given moment
is that the six of us

16:18.725 --> 16:20.943
are paying for a mistake
made by one of us.

16:20.944 --> 16:22.561
And that means,
at any given moment,

16:22.562 --> 16:24.580
one of us is screwing up
so badly,

16:24.581 --> 16:27.499
that he or she is gonna forgive
whoever screws up next.

16:27.500 --> 16:31.286
Now I'm gonna do something
that Octavian never would...

16:31.287 --> 16:32.788
yeah, I read the book.

16:32.789 --> 16:35.090
I'm gonna say that
whoever untied the Professor...

16:35.091 --> 16:36.442
I don't give a crap.

16:36.443 --> 16:37.876
Because whoever it was,

16:37.877 --> 16:41.997
I know it was
some flawed, selfish, weak,

16:41.998 --> 16:44.166
hopeless soul like me.

16:47.771 --> 16:50.656
Exactly what the betrayer
would say.

16:50.657 --> 16:52.708
Fine, dick, if it was me,

16:52.709 --> 16:55.494
I'm gonna lose my "a"
by tying you up again.

16:55.495 --> 16:58.180
Ow!

16:58.181 --> 17:00.249
Get over here.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.984
That's hurting.
That's hurting.

17:03.403 --> 17:05.253
Now, if you'll excuse us,

17:05.255 --> 17:06.789
we have some gifts to open.

17:06.790 --> 17:08.557
Ooh, mine first, mine first.

17:08.558 --> 17:11.510
Milady.

17:11.511 --> 17:15.948
Mm, Kevin, did you wrap
these presents yourself?

17:15.949 --> 17:18.666
Once again, I'm not a dog.

17:18.667 --> 17:21.069
Zoink.

17:21.069 --> 17:22.387
Doink.

17:22.387 --> 17:24.906
Kevin, how do you tie a knot?

17:24.907 --> 17:26.290
Really simple.

17:26.291 --> 17:29.495
So you go...

17:29.496 --> 17:33.098
Make a little rabbit ear
like so,

17:33.099 --> 17:35.284
then the kids go marching
down the well.

17:35.285 --> 17:37.553
Oh...My...God.

17:37.554 --> 17:39.704
Professor,
you were never tied up.

17:39.705 --> 17:41.673
What?

17:41.674 --> 17:43.108
What do you want me to say?

17:45.645 --> 17:48.914
What do you want me to say?

17:48.915 --> 17:50.749
That I did it
because I'm lonely?

17:50.750 --> 17:53.302
That my daughter isn't in town?

17:53.303 --> 17:55.370
That she never comes to see me

17:55.371 --> 17:58.190
because she finds me
too manipulative?

17:58.191 --> 18:00.959
Or you could say you're sorry
for the whole thing.

18:00.960 --> 18:04.062
Yes, I suppose
that would be accurate.

18:04.063 --> 18:06.365
And that, as compensation
for the mental anguish

18:06.366 --> 18:08.617
you caused us,
you'll give us an "a."

18:08.618 --> 18:10.686
Jeff.
Overreaching?

18:10.687 --> 18:13.639
Fair enough. Maybe you
can grade us separately.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.275
That way, Shirley and Annie
can get their "a" s.

18:16.276 --> 18:18.193
No, Jeffrey,
he can give us an "f"

18:18.194 --> 18:19.695
or you can give us an "a,"

18:19.696 --> 18:22.447
but we should all get
the same grade.

18:22.448 --> 18:24.917
God's sake, don't rub it in.

18:24.918 --> 18:27.486
Very well.
Seeing as you saved me

18:27.487 --> 18:31.473
from my yearly Christmas
tradition of plum pudding,

18:31.474 --> 18:34.109
roasted goose,
and updating my suicide note...

18:35.795 --> 18:39.665
I suppose I could give you
a "c."

18:39.666 --> 18:41.600
- Oh.
- Uh.

18:42.743 --> 18:43.518
Plus.

18:45.188 --> 18:46.738
Merry Christmas.

18:46.739 --> 18:49.324
Merry Christmas.

18:51.744 --> 18:53.595
♪ Jingle bell, jingle bell ♪

18:53.596 --> 18:55.297
♪ jingle bell rock

18:55.298 --> 18:57.015
♪ jingle bells swing

18:57.016 --> 18:58.350
♪ and jingle bells ring.

18:58.351 --> 19:00.552
Annie!

19:00.553 --> 19:03.438
Oh, my God.

19:03.439 --> 19:06.158
Wow.
That's really great.

19:06.159 --> 19:07.609
All right.
* Jingle bell

19:07.610 --> 19:09.444
Oh, poppy poppy paper.

19:09.445 --> 19:10.579
♪ Jingle bells chime

19:10.580 --> 19:11.947
No, there's a gift in there.

19:11.948 --> 19:14.116
Yeah.

19:14.117 --> 19:15.900
Buttered noodles.
My favorite.

19:15.901 --> 19:17.586
- Oh!
- By the way,

19:17.587 --> 19:18.954
I didn't get anyone gifts,

19:18.955 --> 19:20.339
so my gift to you all

19:20.340 --> 19:22.507
is you get to lord it over me
for the next year.

19:22.508 --> 19:25.510
No, stupid, a gift
doesn't create an obligation.

19:25.511 --> 19:27.813
It's the obligation
that's a gift.

19:27.814 --> 19:30.265
I gotta drop a deuce.

19:30.266 --> 19:32.768
See you guys.

19:34.971 --> 19:36.388
Hey, it's Chang.

19:36.389 --> 19:38.607
No, they're not expelled.

19:38.608 --> 19:40.309
I have to do something else.

19:46.301 --> 19:50.225
Oh, how could I have stayed mad
at you, guys?

19:50.226 --> 19:54.313
Here, I was gonna save these
for the real Christmas day,

19:54.314 --> 19:56.098
but these guys
were getting antsy.

19:56.099 --> 19:57.433
Hi, there.

19:57.434 --> 19:59.485
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

19:59.486 --> 20:01.320
Oh!

20:01.321 --> 20:02.655
August.

20:02.656 --> 20:05.407
And this one is James.

20:05.408 --> 20:08.360
And this one is Fiona.

20:08.361 --> 20:10.863
And these two guys are Jeffrey.

20:10.864 --> 20:12.164
At nice times like this,

20:12.165 --> 20:13.832
I wonder what's happening
in the darkest timeline.

20:13.833 --> 20:14.950
Timeline?

20:14.951 --> 20:18.120
Abed, there are
no dark timelines.

20:21.074 --> 20:24.827
Your honor,
I may not have a right arm,

20:24.828 --> 20:27.496
but I am armed
with what's right.

20:27.497 --> 20:30.916
My client miss Edison did rob
several drug stores,

20:30.917 --> 20:33.619
and, yes, she did stab
several pharmacists,

20:33.620 --> 20:36.105
but let's talk
about the bigger crime,

20:36.106 --> 20:41.360
that someone so beautiful
has been removed from society.

20:41.361 --> 20:44.713
Miss Edison,
you are hereby released

20:44.714 --> 20:47.583
from Greendale Insane Asylum.

20:47.584 --> 20:50.035
Are you sure you don't have a
problem with our age difference?

20:50.036 --> 20:52.204
Yeah, I wish
you were even younger.

20:52.205 --> 20:53.772
Now, come on,
the others are waiting.

20:53.773 --> 20:56.742
We've got a prime timeline
to destroy.
