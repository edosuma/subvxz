YOUNG BOB (falsetto): <i>Hey, Bob.
Thanks for cooking me.</i>

00:22.663 --> 00:24.998
You're pretty good with
that spatula; How old are you?

00:24.999 --> 00:26.600
(normal voice):
14.

00:26.601 --> 00:28.401
(falsetto): Oh, wow,
you're like a prodigy.

00:28.402 --> 00:30.103
(normal voice): Yeah,
I'm pretty good, I guess.

00:30.104 --> 00:32.738
(falsetto, laughing):
That tickles, I like it.

00:32.773 --> 00:34.007
Here you go, Henry.
What's this?

00:34.008 --> 00:35.642
I ordered the usual.

00:35.643 --> 00:37.077
Well, well, since Pop's
getting his prostate checked,

00:37.078 --> 00:38.411
and I'm manning the grill,

00:38.412 --> 00:41.448
I thought, why not try
the unusual?

00:41.482 --> 00:43.516
Ooh.
Henry, I present to you

00:43.517 --> 00:46.019
"Baby You Can Chive
My Car Burger."

00:46.020 --> 00:49.022
Sour cream, chives, and little
fried pickle wheels on the sides

00:49.023 --> 00:50.624
that make it look like a car.

00:50.625 --> 00:51.992
Vroom, vroom!

00:51.993 --> 00:53.493
You know he's a
grown man, right?

00:53.494 --> 00:55.228
Someone's having fun
at work today.

00:55.263 --> 00:58.031
Yep, a lot. I came up with
a bunch of ideas for specials.

00:58.032 --> 01:00.267
The Crispy Brinkley Burger,
the Richard Per-Simmons Burger,

01:00.268 --> 01:02.035
the Greed is Gouda Burger...

01:02.036 --> 01:04.037
Easy, easy, whew. Okay, okay.
PETE: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:04.038 --> 01:05.405
Sorry, I got excited.

01:05.438 --> 01:07.240
I-I'm just passionate.
(door opens)

01:07.275 --> 01:09.109
So that's what
a prostate exam is.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.278
(shudders)

01:10.311 --> 01:11.778
Did you guys
know what it was?

01:11.779 --> 01:13.446
I think it's more fun
if it's a surprise.

01:13.447 --> 01:16.201
Hey, Big Bob,
look what Little Bob made.

01:16.217 --> 01:17.851
Junior, what is this?

01:17.852 --> 01:20.387
It's a "Baby You Can
Chive My Car Burger."

01:20.388 --> 01:22.055
A what you can
what my what burger?

01:22.056 --> 01:23.924
Henry, did you order this?
What'd you order?

01:23.958 --> 01:25.826
The usual, but this looks okay.

01:25.827 --> 01:27.027
I-I like cars.

01:27.061 --> 01:28.395
Try it, Henry,
y-you might like it.

01:28.396 --> 01:30.197
Don't tell him
what to eat, Junior.

01:30.198 --> 01:31.965
He didn't order that, he's
a tuna melt man... look at him.

01:31.999 --> 01:33.967
I-I'll take a bite.
I'll eat the wheel.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.869
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
it's my burger-car. Get off.

01:35.903 --> 01:37.737
It's nobody's burger-car.

01:37.738 --> 01:39.372
We'll make you a tuna melt.

01:39.407 --> 01:41.074
Just everybody shush!

01:41.075 --> 01:43.210
That's the last time I
get my prostate checked.

01:43.244 --> 01:45.011
LINDA:
<i>Wrap it up, Teddy.</i>

01:45.046 --> 01:46.680
We got to close up.

01:46.681 --> 01:47.914
We're going to Big Bob's
Christmas Eve party.

01:47.915 --> 01:49.049
Ugh, Teddy, eat slower.

01:52.086 --> 01:53.553
Actually,
that's too slow.

01:53.588 --> 01:55.055
Dear Lord Santa,
this year,

01:55.089 --> 01:56.857
please bless me
with a calendar of

01:56.858 --> 01:59.077
Australian firefighters holding
puppies in casual settings.

01:59.093 --> 02:00.827
And bless me
with a perm.

02:00.828 --> 02:03.330
You only live once; Why not
have a little fun up top?

02:03.331 --> 02:05.532
And, Santa, bless me with
an internship at your company.

02:05.533 --> 02:07.334
Preferably something
in the flying animal

02:07.335 --> 02:09.502
or breaking and entering
department, thank you.

02:09.503 --> 02:10.904
Kids, I know it's
Christmas Eve

02:10.905 --> 02:12.372
but I don't think
you pray to Santa.

02:12.406 --> 02:13.907
Lord Santa, strike him down!

02:13.941 --> 02:15.375
Ooh, that reminds me.

02:15.376 --> 02:16.576
I'm supposed to go
to midnight mass tonight.

02:16.611 --> 02:17.711
Either that
or midnight basketball.

02:17.712 --> 02:18.845
I've got my shorts in the truck.

02:18.846 --> 02:20.046
What do you think I should do?

02:20.047 --> 02:21.882
Combine them... mass-ketball!

02:21.916 --> 02:23.583
All right, let's go.

02:23.584 --> 02:25.185
Big Bob's Christmas party,
here we come.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.920
I don't want to go.

02:26.921 --> 02:29.122
Plus, is it a party if my dad
just works the whole time

02:29.123 --> 02:30.557
and charges people?

02:30.558 --> 02:32.259
Isn't that just
being a restaurant?

02:32.293 --> 02:34.561
It's Christmas, he invites us
every year, we're going.

02:34.562 --> 02:36.430
But we just went
two years ago.

02:36.431 --> 02:38.665
That was seven years ago.
You sure?

02:38.699 --> 02:40.834
I remember. I was
still breast-feeding.

02:40.868 --> 02:42.769
No, you weren't.
Not with you.

02:42.804 --> 02:45.540
Fine, we'll go, but we're
sticking to the 15-minute rule.

02:45.573 --> 02:46.740
What?
What are you talking about?

02:46.774 --> 02:48.041
It-It's that
I can only be

02:48.042 --> 02:49.643
around my dad
for 15 minutes.

02:49.644 --> 02:51.945
Then I have to leave before
I completely lose it.

02:51.946 --> 02:53.447
Well, good luck.
(timer dings)

02:53.481 --> 02:54.714
I give it three months.

02:54.715 --> 02:55.782
I'm gonna go inside.

02:55.783 --> 02:57.217
(timer dings)

02:57.218 --> 02:59.152
You're a lot fatter
than I was at your age.

02:59.153 --> 03:00.152
Gotta go.

03:00.154 --> 03:01.421
Aw, cute kid.

03:01.422 --> 03:02.823
(kissing)

03:02.824 --> 03:04.257
(timer dings) So you
named him Gene, huh?

03:04.258 --> 03:05.425
Is it too late
to change that?

03:05.426 --> 03:06.726
I'm gonna leave now.

03:06.727 --> 03:08.562
But this is your house.
That's okay.

03:08.563 --> 03:11.264
Yep, so now Dad only sees
Grandpa in 15-minute intervals.

03:11.265 --> 03:13.151
It's like speed dating
but with your dad.

03:13.167 --> 03:15.168
Hey, father issues...
we all got 'em.

03:15.169 --> 03:16.303
I've got
mother issues, too.

03:16.337 --> 03:17.771
I've even got cousin issues.

03:17.772 --> 03:19.241
Beautiful blonde cousin issues.

03:19.273 --> 03:20.707
Aw... Ew. What?

03:20.742 --> 03:22.576
Oh, forget
your 15-minute rule.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.512
Tonight's the night you and your
dad finally patch everything up.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.640
I enjoy his opinions on
what's ruining America.

03:53.641 --> 03:55.208
You know what
you should do?

03:55.209 --> 03:57.210
You should
ask him for $5.

03:57.211 --> 03:59.146
He'll give it
to you... in cash.

I got Mom that hip-hop
yoga video she wanted.

04:16.664 --> 04:17.798
I went in on it.

04:17.798 --> 04:19.232
Tina, how much

04:19.233 --> 04:20.666

04:23.504 --> 04:25.072
(gasps)
I didn't get him anything.

04:25.073 --> 04:26.406
Oh, way to go, T.

04:26.407 --> 04:27.874
Gene and I are

Yeah, Tina.

04:29.243 --> 04:31.078
Sorry, it's just been
a crazy season.

04:31.079 --> 04:33.480
Well, we can't put "sorry"
under the tree, can we?

04:33.481 --> 04:35.483
We'll just give him
whatever's in my pocket.

04:35.516 --> 04:37.918
A chocolate-covered raisin.

04:37.919 --> 04:39.186
Scratch that. A raisin.

04:39.220 --> 04:41.154
Crap, this happens
every year.

04:41.155 --> 04:43.256
Well, we're gonna have to
make him a gift at Grandpa's.

04:43.257 --> 04:44.324
Mm.

04:44.325 --> 04:45.726
There it is.

04:45.727 --> 04:49.596
Our restaurant's dad.

04:49.597 --> 04:51.298
Hey, look who's here.

04:51.332 --> 04:52.499
Hey, Pete.

Merry Christmas,

04:53.601 --> 04:55.535
Merry Christmas, Pete!

04:55.536 --> 04:58.205
You haven't been here in so
long, I grew a big white beard.

04:58.206 --> 04:59.906
Just kidding, it's
a Santa beard.

04:59.907 --> 05:01.041
This is my real beard.

05:04.746 --> 05:06.046
Pete owns the bar
next door, remember?

05:06.047 --> 05:07.681
Is it still gay,
still going strong?

you, Pop Pop.

Merry Christmas, Big Bob.

Linda, kids.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.770
Boy, you get smaller
every year.

05:29.771 --> 05:31.438
When do I stop
calling you Big Bob

05:31.439 --> 05:33.440
and start calling you
Old Wrinkly Shriveled-Up Bob?

05:33.441 --> 05:34.541
Ha! All right, all right.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.642
Sorry.

05:35.643 --> 05:36.943
And how are my
grandkids doing?

05:36.944 --> 05:38.380
I got problems,

05:38.413 --> 05:40.113
but nothing
five dollars wouldn't fix.

05:40.114 --> 05:41.615
(clears throat)

05:41.616 --> 05:43.617
Grandpa, you don't look
a day over grandpa age.

05:43.651 --> 05:45.419
You're a doll, Tina.
Thank you.

05:45.420 --> 05:46.720
Hey, look what
I got here.

05:46.721 --> 05:47.788
Who's your
favorite president?

05:47.789 --> 05:49.089
Bill Pullman!

05:49.090 --> 05:50.891
"Today we fight
for our independence!"

05:50.892 --> 05:52.325
Here you go.
Oh.

05:52.326 --> 05:53.560
Merry Christmas.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.295
Thanks, Gramps.
Hey, listen.

05:55.296 --> 05:57.064
We have an arts
and crafts emergency.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.332
We need glue, we need paper,
we need pasta.

05:59.333 --> 06:00.934
We need it,
like, yesterday.

06:00.935 --> 06:02.736
How many sizes
of googly-eyes do you have?

06:02.737 --> 06:04.438
I don't really
have any of that.

06:04.439 --> 06:06.740
But I've got a bunch of
crap down in the basement

06:06.741 --> 06:08.642
if you kids want
to take a look.

06:08.643 --> 06:11.144
One man's trash is another man's
present for their father.

06:11.179 --> 06:12.779
Hey, Junior.
How are things?

06:12.780 --> 06:14.781
Eh, my prep guy's
gone tonight.

06:14.782 --> 06:16.483
Went to the hospital 'cause
his daughter's having a baby.

06:16.484 --> 06:18.118
People can be pretty
selfish, I guess.

06:18.119 --> 06:19.119
(scoffs)
Jerk baby.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.120
Linda.

06:20.121 --> 06:21.254
Uh, h-hold on here.

06:21.255 --> 06:22.689
Bobby, this is
going well.

06:22.690 --> 06:24.624
Yeah, check back with me
in 14-and-a-half minutes.

06:24.625 --> 06:25.959
(whispering):
Christmas magic.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.361
Stop saying that.
No, I don't want to.

06:27.362 --> 06:29.363
You sure look slammed
tonight, Big Bob.

06:29.364 --> 06:30.931
Seems like you
could use a hand.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.200
If only there was someone here...
Lin, no.

06:33.201 --> 06:35.369
- Who knew their way around the kitchen...
- Stop.

06:35.370 --> 06:36.937
They knew the menu...

06:36.971 --> 06:38.839
Lin, no.
Where to get the cheese...

06:38.873 --> 06:40.273
No.
Knew where that goes.

06:40.274 --> 06:41.675
Stop.
They knew their way around.

06:41.676 --> 06:43.276
Stop it.
Like the back of their hand.

06:43.277 --> 06:44.811
Like they were raised here.
No, no. I-I don't.

06:44.812 --> 06:45.979
Yeah, I doubt he'd...
Bob could help cook.

06:45.980 --> 06:47.381
No, I-I don't...
Ah?

06:47.382 --> 06:49.016
I'll get trapped in there...
15-minute rule.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.317
It's you father...
Stop it.

06:50.318 --> 06:51.351
It's your father.
Shut up.

06:51.352 --> 06:52.519
All right!

06:52.520 --> 06:54.354
You two bond, have fun!

06:56.909 --> 06:58.510
BIG BOB:
<i>Okay, this is it.</i>

06:58.544 --> 06:59.845
I'm gonna give Little Bob
his Christmas gift.

06:59.846 --> 07:01.146
Everybody ready?

07:01.180 --> 07:04.049
Bob Junior!
Wh-What's going on?

07:04.083 --> 07:06.885
Bobby, you've been working here
your whole life.

07:06.886 --> 07:09.054
And I'm sure you've been
waiting for this day.

07:09.055 --> 07:10.889
W-What are you doing?

07:10.890 --> 07:12.391
From this point forward,

07:12.392 --> 07:15.160
Big Bob's Diner will
officially be called...

07:15.161 --> 07:16.028
Oh, Dad, don't.

07:16.062 --> 07:18.130
...Bob and Son's.

07:18.164 --> 07:19.731
All right!

07:19.766 --> 07:21.299
Yeah!
(cheering)

07:21.334 --> 07:22.868
The new menus.

07:22.902 --> 07:25.237
And... Okay, that's gonna
say "Son's."

07:25.238 --> 07:26.872
It's not done yet,
but it's great, huh?

07:26.906 --> 07:28.173
My cousin's painting
it. He's slow,

07:28.174 --> 07:29.875
he can only do about
a letter a day,

07:29.876 --> 07:31.743
but he can spell like
a son of a bitch.

07:31.778 --> 07:33.378
Like a son of a bitch.

07:33.379 --> 07:34.379
Come here, partner.

07:34.380 --> 07:35.380
Uh...

07:35.381 --> 07:36.581
(mocking):
Uh, uh...

07:36.582 --> 07:38.458
Come on, want to be
partners, or what?

07:39.585 --> 07:40.986
No?

07:41.020 --> 07:42.721
(gasping)
You're welcome.

07:42.722 --> 07:44.656
I think...
Wait, what'd you just say?

07:44.690 --> 07:45.891
I said no.

07:45.892 --> 07:47.459
I could never be
partners with you.

07:47.460 --> 07:48.927
You're impossible to work with.

07:48.961 --> 07:50.762
What? Oh, boy.
Easy, Little Bob.

07:50.797 --> 07:52.130
I want to
change the menu,

07:52.131 --> 07:53.231
a-and you never want
to change the menu.

07:53.266 --> 07:55.534
And you're so critical.

07:55.568 --> 07:57.202
I can't even lift a
spatula without you saying

07:57.203 --> 07:58.403
I'm doing it wrong.

07:58.404 --> 07:59.538
'Cause you're
doing it wrong!

07:59.572 --> 08:01.206
L-Let's let the spatula decide.

08:01.207 --> 08:04.042
You both call it,
a-and we'll see who it goes to.

08:04.077 --> 08:06.078
I want to express myself
in the kitchen!

08:06.079 --> 08:08.747
And when I say that,
he makes this weird sound!

08:08.781 --> 08:10.549
(sighing scoff)
That sound!

08:10.550 --> 08:11.550
What is that?!

08:11.551 --> 08:12.617
You're gonna do this?

08:12.618 --> 08:14.219
Right now?
In front of everybody?

08:14.220 --> 08:15.620
You know what? Get out!

08:15.621 --> 08:17.589
Take your jokey
burger specials and go!

08:17.590 --> 08:19.591
Fine! You just gave me

08:19.592 --> 08:20.992
a new burger idea.

08:20.993 --> 08:23.428
The I'm Sproutta Here Burger.

08:23.429 --> 08:24.996
Comes with sprouts.

08:24.997 --> 08:26.965
Ah, not that but
something else.

08:26.999 --> 08:29.434
(sighing scoff)
I thought of a better one!

08:29.435 --> 08:31.136
The "I'd Be Cheddar Off

08:31.137 --> 08:33.839
Literally Anywhere
But Here Burger!"

08:33.840 --> 08:36.408
Comes with aged cheddar...
forget it!

08:36.409 --> 08:38.443
Forget it!
Merry freaking Christmas!

08:38.477 --> 08:41.279
Merry Christmas,
Little Bob!

08:41.313 --> 08:42.981
Lin, this was
not the plan.

08:42.982 --> 08:45.584
Me cooking with my father at
the party was not the plan.

08:45.585 --> 08:47.352
We are radically
off plan.

08:47.353 --> 08:48.620
Bob, calm down.
Listen to me.

08:48.621 --> 08:50.489
This is a great opportunity
for you two

08:50.490 --> 08:52.691
to turn your bad blood
to glad blood.

08:52.692 --> 08:55.027
Here, Bob, have some
Christmas magic, eh?

08:55.028 --> 08:56.995
Wait, Christmas
magic is wine?

08:57.030 --> 08:58.764
It's whatever you want it to be.

08:58.765 --> 09:02.501
It can be snow or Santa or beer
or gin or rum or schnapps.

09:02.535 --> 09:04.770
I-I get it. Listen, I've been
with him for five minutes,

09:04.771 --> 09:06.304
so I'm setting this timer
for ten minutes,

09:06.305 --> 09:07.773
and then I'm leaving.

09:07.807 --> 09:09.041
Well, I'm setting
this timer to forever.

09:09.042 --> 09:10.609
'Cause that's how long

09:10.610 --> 09:12.177
you and your father are
gonna love each other.

09:12.178 --> 09:13.712
Talking about your heart,
Bob, not your nipple.

09:13.713 --> 09:15.981
All right, pastrami
with mustard, table three.

09:15.982 --> 09:18.116
Uh, w-where's the club sandwich
for table two?

09:18.151 --> 09:19.151
Right here, Dad.

09:19.152 --> 09:20.485
I got a great idea, Big Bob.

09:20.486 --> 09:22.187
How about I run the food,
that way

09:22.188 --> 09:24.022
you can stay in the kitchen
and cook with Little Bob.

09:24.057 --> 09:27.025
No, no, I-I think Big Bob is
fine running the food. That's...

09:27.060 --> 09:29.127
Look out, table two, here
comes Linda with your club!

09:29.128 --> 09:30.162
(Bob sighs)

09:30.196 --> 09:31.396
Wait, where's table two?

09:31.397 --> 09:32.397
You order a club?

09:32.398 --> 09:33.665
Club? Club?

09:33.700 --> 09:35.267
Present for Dad,

09:35.301 --> 09:37.069
present for Dad,
present for Dad.

09:37.070 --> 09:39.071
Ooh, cans of beans!

09:39.072 --> 09:40.672
(imitating drums)

09:40.673 --> 09:42.641
Dad loves to drum
on beans, right?

09:42.675 --> 09:44.810
What about this chair?
Dad sits sometimes.

09:44.811 --> 09:47.679
Ugh, boring.
He'll sit when he's dead, Tina.

09:47.714 --> 09:50.148
What if we glue all these
mousetraps together,

09:50.149 --> 09:51.783
and call it a super trap?

09:51.818 --> 09:54.019
(gasps) What if I make
my chair a super chair? Like,

09:54.020 --> 09:56.621
if I tape this pad of paper
to it, then he could journal.

09:56.656 --> 09:58.323
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

09:58.324 --> 10:00.525
Is this a little friendly
competition we have here?

10:00.526 --> 10:02.527
A little Christmas competition?

10:02.528 --> 10:05.163
Whoever gives Dad
the best present, wins a...

10:05.164 --> 10:06.765
A Mistle-Tony!

10:06.766 --> 10:09.334
Yes! The most coveted
award in gift-giving!

10:09.335 --> 10:10.736
Dibs on bringing Mom
to the ceremony!

10:10.737 --> 10:12.104
Dibs on bringing Dad.
Dibs on bringing Dad.

10:12.105 --> 10:13.105
Nope, too late.

10:13.106 --> 10:14.373
So, who you bringing, Tina?

10:14.374 --> 10:15.374
I don't know now.

10:15.375 --> 10:16.375
Yeah.

10:17.443 --> 10:19.845
So, uh, th-the grill
seems good.

10:19.846 --> 10:21.246
It's getting
to be an antique.

10:21.247 --> 10:22.727
Yeah, we all are, you know?
(chuckles)

10:22.749 --> 10:23.749
Yeah.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.117
It-It's a new hood?

10:25.118 --> 10:26.952
Five years ago.
Good hood?

10:26.953 --> 10:28.854
Yeah, pretty good.
Pretty good hood.

10:28.855 --> 10:30.922
Yeah, I-I got a good hood, too.
Ah, that's good.

10:30.923 --> 10:33.258
You always said you need a good hood.
I never said that.

10:33.259 --> 10:34.793
I thought you said
that; I... that's...

10:34.794 --> 10:36.461
No one in the history of
time has ever said that.

10:36.462 --> 10:38.196
"All you need is a good hood."
I swear I remember

10:38.197 --> 10:39.631
you saying that all
you need is a good...

10:39.632 --> 10:41.133
That wasn't me.
It was someone else.

10:41.134 --> 10:42.601
I don't know why anyone
else would say that.

10:42.635 --> 10:44.269
(ticking)

10:46.572 --> 10:48.040
Dad's chair is almost done.

10:48.041 --> 10:49.808
He'll never have
to stand up again.

10:49.809 --> 10:51.710
Dad's thirsty;
He's got a water bottle.

10:51.711 --> 10:53.078
He's cold; Box of matches.

10:53.079 --> 10:54.313
Now he's bored. Not anymore.

10:54.314 --> 10:55.614
Here's a basketball.

10:55.615 --> 10:56.882
And then I can
use this dish towel

10:56.883 --> 10:58.116
to wipe the floor with you.

10:58.117 --> 10:59.951
Because I just won
the Mistle-Tony.

10:59.952 --> 11:02.220
Um, when you see this trap,
you're gonna want to shut yours.

11:02.221 --> 11:03.622
Period. End of burn.

11:03.656 --> 11:05.457
How's your present going,
Little Drummer Gene?

11:05.458 --> 11:07.559
Beans, beans,
the tragical fruit?

11:07.560 --> 11:09.461
The more you drum it,
the more you lose?

11:09.462 --> 11:10.962
The contest?
That we're in right now?

11:10.963 --> 11:13.065
Mm-hmm.
Like the saying, about the beans,

11:13.066 --> 11:14.399
but with, uh,
different words.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.168
Well, I was gonna
empty out these cans

11:16.169 --> 11:17.602
to make a better
drum sound,

11:17.603 --> 11:19.304
but now I think I might
soak these old bones

11:19.305 --> 11:20.772
in a little bean bath!

11:20.807 --> 11:22.040
Gene, you're pulling
out of the competition?

11:22.075 --> 11:23.575
No.

11:23.576 --> 11:25.677
I'm just taking a little
siesta to clear my mind.

11:25.678 --> 11:27.245
Tina, be a dear
and get me

11:27.246 --> 11:29.147
two slices of ham
to put over my eyes?

11:29.182 --> 11:31.416
Hey, Dad, we're probably
gonna head out in about, um,

11:31.451 --> 11:33.618
30 seconds. So, just
have to finish up

11:33.619 --> 11:35.287
this last order.
What do you think this says?

11:35.288 --> 11:36.955
"Grilled cheese."

11:36.956 --> 11:39.157
Grilled cheese. Huh.
That's weird. Wh... what?

11:39.158 --> 11:41.126
Nah. Nothing. Never mind.
(timer dings)

11:41.127 --> 11:43.128
It just... it says "grilled
cheese" on the ticket,

11:43.129 --> 11:45.230
but maybe you thought it said
"burnt toast," I don't know.

11:45.264 --> 11:47.199
(high-pitched):
Oh, my God.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.034
Okay, Dad. We're gonna hit the road.
How we doing?

11:49.035 --> 11:51.336
Good. We're just learning
how to make grilled cheese

11:51.337 --> 11:52.971
for the first time,
for some reason.

11:52.972 --> 11:54.339
(high-pitched chuckle)

11:54.340 --> 11:55.807
(laughs) Oh, hey, look at me!

11:55.808 --> 11:57.542
I got a new order over here!

11:57.543 --> 12:00.445
Uh, Henry here at the counter
says he wants "the usual."

12:00.480 --> 12:03.882
♪ ♪

12:05.284 --> 12:06.752
(growls):
"The usual."

12:06.786 --> 12:08.120
Uh... yeah?

12:08.154 --> 12:09.955
I'll take care of
Henry's usual, Bob.

12:09.956 --> 12:11.523
You keep burning
the grilled cheese.

12:11.524 --> 12:13.292
Oh, no, Dad, I'm gonna
take care of this.

12:13.293 --> 12:14.726
I'm gonna take
care of Henry.

12:14.727 --> 12:16.261
What are you talking about?
I'm talking

12:16.296 --> 12:18.664
about the burger I tried
to make him when I was 14

12:18.665 --> 12:20.465
and you put me
in charge of the restaurant.

12:20.466 --> 12:23.068
That's what I'm talking about!
Wait, what burger?

12:23.069 --> 12:26.338
The Baby You Can
Chive My Car Burger, Pop!

12:26.372 --> 12:28.340
(nervous laugh)
Okay.

12:28.374 --> 12:31.009
Everyone's fine.
Talking it out.

12:31.044 --> 12:32.811
Here we go! Let's see
if he's got any chives.

12:32.812 --> 12:34.246
Probably not!

12:34.247 --> 12:36.214
Why would he have
chives in a restaurant?

12:36.215 --> 12:37.549
That would be
too much flavor!

12:37.583 --> 12:40.485
Oh, I've got chives, buddy.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.554
Good. You ready, Henry?
What?

12:42.555 --> 12:44.022
Stay out of this, Henry!
Sorry.

12:44.023 --> 12:45.424
You are not making
one of your

12:45.425 --> 12:46.892
gimmick burgers
in my kitchen!

12:46.893 --> 12:48.427
Vroom. Vroom.

12:48.428 --> 12:49.695
What is that?

12:49.696 --> 12:50.929
It's a car sound!

12:50.930 --> 12:52.197
That's not a car sound.

12:52.198 --> 12:53.432
This is a car sound.

12:53.433 --> 12:56.902
(imitates engine revving)

12:56.903 --> 12:58.270
(imitates brakes screeching)

12:58.271 --> 12:59.538
That's how you do it.

12:59.539 --> 13:00.739
Oh, my God!

13:01.446 --> 13:03.586
Al right, stop making that burguer
right now!

13:03.587 --> 13:05.212
Henry wants the tuna melt!

13:05.213 --> 13:06.880
Isn't that right, Henry?
No, Pop.

13:06.881 --> 13:08.715
Henry wants the Baby You
Can Chive My Car Burger

13:08.716 --> 13:11.452
he never had a chance to
taste because of you!

13:11.486 --> 13:13.320
Look, uh, I don't want
to cause any trouble here.

13:13.354 --> 13:16.023
I'll just eat whatever
you put in front of me.

13:16.024 --> 13:17.958
No problem, easy breezy.

13:17.992 --> 13:19.159
You're getting
the tuna melt!

13:19.160 --> 13:20.394
You're getting
the burger, Henry!

13:20.428 --> 13:22.196
Not if I make
the tuna melt first!

13:22.197 --> 13:23.397
Good luck!
(grunts)

13:23.431 --> 13:25.399
Hey, don't
box me out.

13:25.433 --> 13:26.934
Hey, if you're
having a hard time

13:26.935 --> 13:28.575
getting to the grill,
it's not my problem.

13:28.603 --> 13:30.270
And... hug.

13:30.271 --> 13:31.905
No? Okay.

13:31.940 --> 13:34.241
Dad will never walk again.
By choice.

13:34.242 --> 13:36.043
Nor will he love
either of you again.

13:36.044 --> 13:37.378
By choice.

13:37.379 --> 13:38.912
Guys?
Did you hear my trash talking?

13:38.913 --> 13:40.280
You can't
hurt me, Tina.

13:40.281 --> 13:42.349
At this point,
I'm more bean than Gene.

13:42.350 --> 13:43.550
LOUISE:
Nobody talk!

13:43.585 --> 13:45.052
Nobody talk.

13:45.053 --> 13:49.456
I just need to get
one more on here and...

13:49.457 --> 13:51.492
I win. I win. I win!

13:51.526 --> 13:54.395
Oh, you might have won
if I was done, but I'm not.

13:54.396 --> 13:56.029
What could be better-y
than a battery

13:56.030 --> 13:57.598
taped to the back of the chair?

13:57.632 --> 14:00.034
Game. Set. Match.

14:00.035 --> 14:01.869
(traps snapping,
girls screaming)

14:01.870 --> 14:03.170
No! No! No!

14:03.204 --> 14:05.105
Uh-oh.
Hope you're happy, Tina.

14:05.106 --> 14:06.974
Now Dad doesn't get
a Christmas present.

14:06.975 --> 14:09.877
Looks like Dad just won a bean
bath with a little pee in it!

14:09.911 --> 14:11.078
Oh, that's something.

14:11.112 --> 14:12.212
This'll make Dad's skin

14:12.213 --> 14:14.081
look 40 again... (screams)

14:14.082 --> 14:15.416
No! I spilled my beans!

14:15.450 --> 14:17.718
I guess the Mistle-Tonys
were a bust.

14:17.752 --> 14:19.153
Tina, new game.

14:19.154 --> 14:21.321
You have ten seconds
to find a gift for Dad. Go!

14:21.322 --> 14:23.557
Um... we could give him
this snow globe?

14:23.558 --> 14:25.359
It says,
"Oh, snow, you didn't."

14:25.393 --> 14:27.227
Attagirl. Wrap it up,
make it look pretty.

14:27.262 --> 14:29.029
I'd give you this big,
beautiful bow,

14:29.064 --> 14:30.597
but then what would I wear?

14:30.632 --> 14:32.299
(grunts) I threw
away your garnish!

14:32.300 --> 14:33.534
Damn it!

14:33.568 --> 14:34.568
Order up!
Order up!

14:34.569 --> 14:35.803
Lin, take this
to Henry!

14:35.804 --> 14:37.071
No, Linda.
Take this to Henry!

14:37.105 --> 14:38.639
I'm not taking anything anywhere

14:38.640 --> 14:39.907
until you two make peace!

14:39.908 --> 14:41.108
You know what you need?

14:41.142 --> 14:42.609
Come on, people! Sing!

14:42.610 --> 14:44.445
We can bring
these guys back together!

14:44.446 --> 14:45.779
♪ Peace, peace, peace ♪

14:45.780 --> 14:47.614
♪ Peace, peace... ♪
Everybody!

14:47.649 --> 14:49.750
♪ Peace, peace... ♪ Come on.
♪ Peace, peace, pea... ♪

14:49.751 --> 14:51.719
Yeah! ♪ Peace ♪ Yeah, yeah...

14:51.753 --> 14:53.587
(Linda continues singing) Fine,
I'll take it to Henry myself!

14:53.588 --> 14:55.155
Then I will, too!

14:55.156 --> 14:56.790
Get your foot out of my...
(screams) Ow!

14:56.825 --> 14:59.126
Come on, it's Christmas!
Here you go, Henry. The usual.

14:59.127 --> 15:00.894
Here you go, Henry. The "Baby
You Can Chive My Car Burger."

15:00.929 --> 15:02.496
♪ Peace, peace... ♪
All right, it's not working.

15:02.530 --> 15:04.932
Uh, they both look... good?

15:04.966 --> 15:06.633
You son of a bitch.
Take a bite.

15:06.668 --> 15:08.268
Eat the tuna melt,
Henry.

15:08.303 --> 15:10.871
Could I just give the burger,
um, a sniff?

15:10.872 --> 15:12.940
Henry...
It's okay to smell.

15:12.941 --> 15:14.141
(sniffing)
<i>Oy gevalt.</i>

15:14.175 --> 15:15.976
Henry...
Smells good, right?

15:16.011 --> 15:18.584
Uh, maybe-maybe just
a... a quick lick?

15:18.613 --> 15:19.613
No, not a lick.
Don't do it.

15:19.614 --> 15:20.614
Don't lick.

15:20.648 --> 15:22.049
Come on.
Get it all

15:22.050 --> 15:23.150
up in there, Henry.
Don't do it, Henry.

15:23.184 --> 15:24.752
You know what? Maybe I won't.

15:24.786 --> 15:26.920
(sighs) I knew you
wouldn't do it, Henry.

15:26.955 --> 15:29.556
Oh, my God, I have to!

15:29.557 --> 15:31.125
Henry!
Oh...

15:31.126 --> 15:32.826
What? I'm not chewing.

15:32.827 --> 15:35.296
I'm just holding it
in my mouth for a second.

15:35.330 --> 15:36.864
Ha! You see
that, Pop?

15:36.898 --> 15:39.166
I'm sorry. Oh... Oh, no.

15:39.167 --> 15:40.401
I'm swallowing.

15:40.402 --> 15:41.669
Oh, it's so good.

15:41.670 --> 15:42.870
I'm having another bite.

15:42.904 --> 15:43.903
No!
(laughs)

15:43.905 --> 15:45.306
I win!

15:45.307 --> 15:47.041
I win! Ha!

15:47.075 --> 15:49.743
How do you like my
joke burgers now, Pop?

15:49.744 --> 15:51.378
Okay, Junior.

15:51.379 --> 15:52.646
You win.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.682
Thanks for coming
to my party.

15:54.716 --> 15:57.051
Hey, everybody!
I'm covered in bean juice!

15:57.052 --> 15:59.353
How about I run around
and you all try to catch me

15:59.354 --> 16:00.587
like a pig at the state fair?

16:00.622 --> 16:02.222
Here I go.
(panting)

16:02.223 --> 16:03.490
Try to catch me.

16:03.491 --> 16:04.892
No one's trying very hard!

16:04.893 --> 16:06.794
Good night, everyone.

16:06.795 --> 16:09.330
Merry Christmas.

16:09.364 --> 16:10.664
Well, he's out.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.199
More bean boy
for the rest of you.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.367
(panting)

16:16.906 --> 16:18.307
BOB:
What?!

16:18.341 --> 16:20.509
Why is everybody
looking at me?!

16:20.510 --> 16:22.144
Bobby, easy, easy.

16:22.178 --> 16:24.113
Dad. Dad.
Yes, Louise?

16:24.114 --> 16:25.714
Everyone looks like
they're mad at you.

16:25.715 --> 16:26.949
Thank you.

16:26.950 --> 16:28.217
Maybe this will
cheer you up, Dad.

16:28.218 --> 16:29.685
(sighs)
Thanks, Tina.

16:29.686 --> 16:32.121
Open it. There's
something inside.

16:32.122 --> 16:33.856
A snow globe.

16:33.857 --> 16:35.257
Yes.
Great. Th...

16:35.258 --> 16:36.859
Wait, where'd you get this?
Europe.

16:36.893 --> 16:39.081
No, the newspaper.
Where-where did you find this?

16:39.095 --> 16:40.529
From Pop Pop's basement.

16:40.530 --> 16:42.131
It was in his desk.
Look at him.

16:42.132 --> 16:43.565
He's like a baby,

16:43.566 --> 16:45.567
playing with the
wrapping paper. Aw.

16:45.602 --> 16:47.036
Bobby, what is it?

16:47.037 --> 16:48.937
It's the first review
of Bob's Burgers.

16:48.938 --> 16:50.272
My dad saved it.

16:50.273 --> 16:52.474
Oh, my God.
That's beautiful.

16:52.475 --> 16:53.742
Read it.
I don't think so.

16:53.743 --> 16:55.144
Read it.

16:55.145 --> 16:56.812
I don't want to read it.
Read it!

16:56.813 --> 16:58.981
"Unique burgers.
Good prices.

16:58.982 --> 17:00.916
"Service leaves something
to be desired.

17:00.917 --> 17:02.318
But worth the trip."

17:02.319 --> 17:03.786
Hmm. Not great.

17:03.787 --> 17:05.587
I mean, it's okay.

17:05.588 --> 17:06.821
Oh, Bobby.

17:06.823 --> 17:08.324
He does love you,

17:08.325 --> 17:09.925
and you drove him out
of his own restaurant.

17:09.925 --> 17:11.160
On Christmas.

17:11.161 --> 17:12.493
(sighs)
Oh, my God.

17:12.494 --> 17:14.329
What did I do?
I just told you.

17:14.330 --> 17:16.098
Oh. Right.
Drive your father out on Christmas...

17:16.098 --> 17:17.333
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I heard.

17:17.334 --> 17:18.701
Oh, my God,
that's so sad.

17:18.734 --> 17:20.736
So much for
Christmas magic.

17:20.737 --> 17:22.237
(door opens)
PETE: Put this on

17:22.271 --> 17:23.405
and come with me.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.973
(gasps)
Wait, what?

17:25.008 --> 17:26.407
Your dad's in my bar.

17:26.409 --> 17:27.710
We're gonna go see him.

17:27.743 --> 17:29.578
Go, Bobby. Go.
I-I...

17:29.579 --> 17:31.647
The kids and I will take
care of the diner. Go.

17:31.681 --> 17:33.315
Yeah, Dad.
When a mysterious

17:33.316 --> 17:34.950
cowboy/Santa says,
"Come with me,"

17:34.951 --> 17:36.652
you climb on that horse
and ride.

17:36.653 --> 17:38.140
Also, free hat!

17:39.823 --> 17:41.724
(country music playing)

17:41.758 --> 17:43.125
BOB:
I thought this was a disco.

17:43.126 --> 17:44.355
PETE:
That's Wednesdays.

17:44.361 --> 17:46.028
Thursdays, we
watch <i> Scandal.</i>

17:46.029 --> 17:47.830
Tonight's Country Western
line dancing.

17:47.831 --> 17:50.199
And tomorrow's Christmas...
or did you forget?

17:50.200 --> 17:51.467
I know. I know.

17:51.468 --> 17:52.701
Things got
a little heated.

17:52.702 --> 17:54.770
There he is.
Go talk to him.

17:54.804 --> 17:56.438
With the hat.

17:56.439 --> 17:57.640
Okay.

17:57.674 --> 17:59.608
Just leave me alone.

17:59.609 --> 18:02.177
Pop, come back to the diner.
I'm busy.

18:02.178 --> 18:03.612
You're just
sitting here.

18:03.613 --> 18:05.314
No, I'm not.
I'm... I'm dancing.

18:05.348 --> 18:06.849
Da... dancing?

18:06.850 --> 18:08.250
You don't dance!

18:08.284 --> 18:11.086
(grunting)

18:11.121 --> 18:12.554
Whoa.

18:12.555 --> 18:14.123
Get out there,
Bob Junior.

18:14.124 --> 18:15.925
Pop, will you please
just come and talk to me?

18:17.060 --> 18:18.627
If you want to
talk to your dad,

18:18.628 --> 18:20.329
you're gonna have
to boot scoot to him.

18:20.330 --> 18:22.398
What does that mean?
What's "boot scoot"?

18:22.399 --> 18:25.834
It looks like
this. Hey-a!

18:25.835 --> 18:27.202
Bend... bend
your knees.

18:27.203 --> 18:28.470
I'm-I'm... ow, okay.

18:28.471 --> 18:29.805
Now shake
that pudding.

18:31.508 --> 18:32.741
What do you want?

18:32.742 --> 18:34.376
I just want to
talk to you.

18:34.377 --> 18:36.612
You're doing it wrong.
Those aren't the steps.

18:36.646 --> 18:38.347
Oh, my God. Really?

18:38.348 --> 18:40.182
This is why I didn't
want to work with you.

18:40.183 --> 18:42.084
You have to control
everything I do.

18:42.085 --> 18:44.186
My cooking,
my dancing...

18:44.187 --> 18:46.588
Not everyone wants to dance
exactly the same way.

18:47.891 --> 18:49.191
Okay, bad example.

18:49.225 --> 18:50.726
You guys are
really good at this.

18:50.727 --> 18:51.994
I'm here every
Friday night.

18:51.995 --> 18:53.228
And Thursdays.

18:53.229 --> 18:54.763
I love <i> Scandal.</i>

18:54.764 --> 18:56.765
Pop, are you...?
I'm not gay, Bob.

18:56.766 --> 18:58.267
These guys are
my friends.

18:58.268 --> 19:00.169
They eat at my diner;
I come here and dance.

19:00.203 --> 19:01.670
Oh!

19:01.671 --> 19:03.405
Ah, damn,
missed it again.

19:03.440 --> 19:04.940
Why'd you come
over here, Bob?

19:04.941 --> 19:06.241
To miss steps?

19:06.242 --> 19:08.210
Look, Pops,
you are who you are,

19:08.211 --> 19:10.746
and I realize now
that I should just accept that.

19:10.747 --> 19:12.181
That's right.
Be yourself, sister.

19:12.215 --> 19:13.949
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

19:13.950 --> 19:15.184
Not for leaving.

19:15.218 --> 19:17.186
And not for starting
my own restaurant.

19:17.220 --> 19:19.855
But just for how
I handled things on

19:19.856 --> 19:22.758
the day we broke up.
(dancers whoop)

19:22.759 --> 19:25.561
I know it was your way
of showing love, it's just...

19:25.562 --> 19:27.496
I never felt like
you were supportive of me.

19:27.530 --> 19:29.031
At least, that's what I thought

19:29.032 --> 19:31.233
until I found
the review you saved.

19:31.268 --> 19:32.968
You found that, huh?
The kids did.

19:32.969 --> 19:35.804
Not a good idea to let my kids
into your basement, by the way.

19:35.805 --> 19:37.573
Gene took a bean bath.

19:37.607 --> 19:39.708
Well, at least somebody's
having a good time tonight.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.610
Dad, I'm sorry.
You didn't deserve

19:41.611 --> 19:43.479
to be embarrassed
in front of your customers.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.115
I did it back then
and I did it again tonight.

19:46.149 --> 19:48.284
Nope. Wrong time.

19:48.318 --> 19:50.419
Listen, I know
why you had to go.

19:50.420 --> 19:53.222
I can be...
not great to work with.

19:53.256 --> 19:55.224
It was tough without
your mom around.

19:55.225 --> 19:56.759
You did great
on your own.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.694
She'd be very proud.
You really think...

19:58.728 --> 20:01.163
Okay, I'm the only guy
facing this way now.

20:01.164 --> 20:02.631
So I'll turn around.

20:02.632 --> 20:04.300
Here we go.

20:04.334 --> 20:06.335
Gene, take this chicken
noodle soup to table five.

20:06.336 --> 20:07.603
On it!

20:07.604 --> 20:09.071
Tina, clean up the spill
by the bathroom.

20:09.072 --> 20:10.639
Bathroom spill
is my middle name.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.341
Attagirl.
Louise, grab some napkins

20:12.342 --> 20:13.642
for the kid at the counter.

20:13.643 --> 20:15.611
That kid's a mess!
I know.

20:15.612 --> 20:17.413
BIG BOB:
Look at your family in there.

20:17.414 --> 20:19.315
They really can sling hash
when they want to.

20:19.349 --> 20:21.083
They don't usually
work this hard.

20:21.084 --> 20:22.518
You got happy kids.

20:22.519 --> 20:25.254
Weird, happy kids.
That's nice.

20:25.255 --> 20:27.456
You're a good dad, Junior.
Thanks, Pops.

20:27.457 --> 20:28.824
Let's go back
inside, huh?

20:28.825 --> 20:30.125
Yeah, let's...
(lock clicks)

20:30.126 --> 20:31.327
(laughing)
Hey! Hey!

20:31.361 --> 20:32.628
Kids, let us in.

20:32.629 --> 20:33.862
Ha ha, no!
Open it!

20:33.863 --> 20:35.164
This is our
restaurant now!

20:35.165 --> 20:36.632
It's called
Chez Restauranto,

20:36.633 --> 20:37.866
and we're
Brazilian barbecue!

20:37.867 --> 20:39.335
TINA:
Here.

20:39.336 --> 20:40.603
Aw, come on, Tina!
Sorry.

20:40.637 --> 20:42.838
LINDA:
