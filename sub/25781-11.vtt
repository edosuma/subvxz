01:48.108 --> 01:49.567
Where did those shots come from?

01:49.651 --> 01:51.111
The Zaiforge cannons.

01:51.194 --> 01:54.322
Sendak was ready for the attack
the entire time. How?

01:54.823 --> 01:56.324
Where is Admiral Sanda?

01:56.783 --> 01:59.244
Sir, she's been gone
since our mission briefing.

02:00.328 --> 02:01.704
Paladins, are you there?

02:03.998 --> 02:05.708
Paladins, do you copy?

02:06.584 --> 02:08.544
Keith? Anyone?

02:11.506 --> 02:13.967
Commander Holt,
what weapons do we have available?

02:14.300 --> 02:17.053
Fusion cannons,
but that fleet is out of range.

02:17.345 --> 02:18.471
What about the MFEs?

02:18.596 --> 02:21.266
The mission depleted their power.
They're charging now.

02:21.599 --> 02:25.395
Shiro, even with the MFEs,
Sendak has an entire fleet.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.356
We need to get them back!
We have to do something.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.192
What about the Atlas?

02:31.276 --> 02:33.361
We've had zero success launching it.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.780
Veronica, monitor the fleet.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.949
-Let us know of any changes.
-Yes, sir.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.702
Come on, let's get that ship
off the ground.

02:44.038 --> 02:46.332
I delivered you the Lions
as you requested.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.795
Now it's time you uphold
your end of the bargain.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.506
Hand and over the Paladins to me
and leave Earth.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.175
That won't be happening.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.510
We made a deal.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.679
Throw her in the brig with the Paladins.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.974
No!

03:03.057 --> 03:06.728
Continue assault and move
the Zaiforge cannons into position.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.441
Anything?

03:12.108 --> 03:13.067
Not yet.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.194
We can shut down all non-essential systems

03:15.278 --> 03:17.655
and use an external source
to fire one engine.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.158
We tried that. It wasn't enough power.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.535
What about crystals from the MFEs?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.203
You think that will work?

03:24.954 --> 03:27.290
Actually, no, scratch that. Far too small.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.376
You don't happen to have
any Nunville, do you?

03:31.586 --> 03:32.462
Nunville?

03:52.607 --> 03:54.817
I'm detecting movement
from the Zaiforge cannons.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.152
Where are they headed?

03:56.611 --> 03:57.862
Based on our projections...

03:58.821 --> 04:01.157
The cannons are converging
above our location!

04:02.200 --> 04:03.952
Even with all the power
we've allocated to it,

04:04.035 --> 04:06.955
the particle barrier will never hold
against a Zaiforge cannon.

04:07.664 --> 04:08.623
Wait, that's it!

04:08.706 --> 04:11.584
We can divert power
from the shield generator to the Atlas.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.254
The base would be unprotected,
but it's possible.

04:14.545 --> 04:15.880
And it just might work.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.175
How much time do we have
before the Zaiforge cannons arrive?

04:19.509 --> 04:21.761
By our calculations,
less than two hours.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.179
We have to hurry.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.808
Veronica, transfer all data
from mission control to the Atlas.

04:26.891 --> 04:27.725
Yes, sir!

04:27.809 --> 04:31.062
Commander Iverson, get all personnel
aboard this ship immediately.

04:31.145 --> 04:31.980
Yes, sir!

04:32.605 --> 04:35.817
All personnel,
report to Atlas bay immediately.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.110
This is not a drill.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.488
Commander Shirogane, the MFEs
are almost at a hundred percent.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.991
These birds are ready to fly.

04:43.491 --> 04:44.492
We need you airborne.

04:44.575 --> 04:47.453
We're shutting down the particle barrier,
so we'll be exposed.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.664
That means you'll be
our last line of defense.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.291
You can count on us.

04:51.916 --> 04:52.834
No shield?

04:53.167 --> 04:54.919
It is our largest source of energy.

04:55.003 --> 04:58.172
Losing it will put the garrison
at a substantial calculated risk.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.784
Dynotherms connected.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.120
Megathrusters are go.

05:51.893 --> 05:52.727
Hello?

05:53.561 --> 05:56.439
Lance! Hunk! Pidge!

05:56.898 --> 05:57.774
Allura!

06:00.902 --> 06:02.153
My bayard's not working.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.198
I'm here.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.158
Yeah, me, too.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.494
How long we been out?

06:10.745 --> 06:12.622
It looks like we've lost about an hour.

06:13.414 --> 06:14.499
What happened?

06:17.960 --> 06:19.253
We're on Sendak's ship.

06:20.421 --> 06:21.464
Admiral Sanda...

06:22.882 --> 06:24.133
She sold us out.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.428
How could she?

06:29.931 --> 06:33.184
He said he'd leave Earth
if he had the Lions, but he lied to me.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.478
This is all my fault.

06:37.146 --> 06:41.484
I wanted to protect my people,
but now I've doomed them.

06:42.610 --> 06:43.986
I've doomed them all.

06:45.822 --> 06:46.989
I'm so sorry.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.494
Admiral, what is Sendak's plan?

06:52.578 --> 06:53.663
Sendak is...

06:55.123 --> 06:57.416
moving the Zaiforge cannons into position.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.086
He's going to destroy Earth.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.172
Please, you must know...

07:03.965 --> 07:06.008
I wanted to save Earth.

07:11.848 --> 07:12.849
We're all set.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.435
I'm ready to divert power
from the barrier generator.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.937
Copy that. We're ready to receive.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.959
Sir, it appears they have lowered
their particle barrier.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.171
How long until the cannons
are charged and in position?

07:43.713 --> 07:44.589
One varga.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.050
That base has been their only defense.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.635
They must be up to something.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.721
Send in the closest command.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.514
Hit them with everything we've got.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.409
Comms tower is down!

08:21.584 --> 08:24.504
Rizavi, Kinkade,
draw their fire away from the base.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.673
Leifsdottir, you're with me.
Hit them hard and hit them quick!

08:28.049 --> 08:29.091
Roger that!

08:29.425 --> 08:31.010
Let's buy our team some time.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.474
We got it. It's charged.

08:36.933 --> 08:37.892
Is everyone aboard?

08:38.183 --> 08:40.019
The garrison's cleared. We're all in.

08:40.977 --> 08:42.063
Prepare for launch.

09:13.803 --> 09:14.637
No!

09:27.024 --> 09:28.776
Hoo-hoo! They can't keep up!

09:45.334 --> 09:46.627
More fighters incoming!

09:49.922 --> 09:51.924
Kinkade, you've got two
on your six!

10:01.976 --> 10:03.436
Leifsdottir, what do you see?

10:03.519 --> 10:07.231
Two cruisers, 76 fighters,
temperate weather patterns, blue skies.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.151
-The perfect conditions for--
-No, Leif! Battle evaluation!

10:10.318 --> 10:12.612
A variation of a tactical
circular formation.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.531
They're protecting the cruisers
to allow them more accurate shots.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.756
I've built a ship that's useless!

10:33.883 --> 10:37.219
It would take the power
of several supermassive black holes

10:37.303 --> 10:39.972
to get this hunk of metal off the ground.

10:40.514 --> 10:43.434
That's it!
Why didn't I think of this before?

10:43.517 --> 10:45.436
Of course! Black holes!

10:45.519 --> 10:48.064
Infinite mass! It was always right here!

10:49.065 --> 10:51.359
Commander Holt,
you're going to want to see this.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.785
Galra squadron launching from cruiser!
Four o'clock high!

11:01.202 --> 11:03.287
Rizavi, Kinkade,
divert their fire!

11:03.663 --> 11:04.497
Copy!

11:04.580 --> 11:06.248
Beginning assault
on the inner ship.

11:10.586 --> 11:13.589
Leifsdottir, keep drawing their fire.
Our base can't take much more.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.550
Yeah, speaking of that,
the Galra ship patterns are changing,

11:16.634 --> 11:18.886
which means they're either on the move
or, more probable,

11:18.969 --> 11:21.055
they're reconfiguring
to adjust for more cruisers.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.601
- Yep, reconfiguring.
- How long can we hold them off?

11:26.143 --> 11:27.937
With the additional firepower
and fighters...

11:28.854 --> 11:29.772
Twelve minutes.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.320
The energy coming off this
is incredible.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.446
The crystal was created

11:37.530 --> 11:39.740
after the destruction
of the Castle of Lions.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.867
It's an amalgamation
of the Quintessence Field

11:41.951 --> 11:45.830
collapsing from infinite mass
and Altean magic into this tiny thing.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.332
We need to get it hooked up
to the Atlas immediately.

11:52.628 --> 11:55.631
This is where I had originally planned
to place a Balmeran crystal.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.758
It serves as the brains of the Atlas.

11:57.842 --> 12:01.429
We're going to have to figure out some way
to accommodate for the difference in size.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.347
It will take a feat of engineering to...

12:16.152 --> 12:17.361
I can't believe it.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.113
It's amazing!

12:21.282 --> 12:23.200
Subsystems fully powered.

12:23.742 --> 12:25.327
Megathrusters are go!

12:25.995 --> 12:28.664
Veronica, monitor the radars,
let us know what you see.

12:28.747 --> 12:32.334
Commander Iverson, I need you on weapons.
And, Coran, get the helm.

12:33.377 --> 12:34.378
Yes, Captain!

12:42.261 --> 12:43.637
The bridge is yours, Shiro.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.308
We could use an engineer.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.186
Yes, sir.

12:52.188 --> 12:55.191
Captain, the Galra fleet
is directly over the launch pad.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.526
MFE squadron,
we need you to clear a path.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.029
The Atlas is powered and ready for launch.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.701
Copy that, Atlas. Pilots, on me!

13:23.344 --> 13:25.095
Their base should fall momentarily.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.390
Sir, something appears to be launching.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.977
Destroy it before it's airborne.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.942
Crew, prepare for launch!

14:06.387 --> 14:09.598
Welcome to the battle, IGF Atlas!
Clearing a path for you now!

14:10.057 --> 14:13.352
MFEs, let's try these pulse projectiles
we've been hanging on to.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.718
Sir, we've been hit
with multiple electromagnetic pulses.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.511
We seem to have lost all power.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.097
Nice work, pilots.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.308
You've temporarily knocked out
their systems.

14:52.766 --> 14:55.144
Commander,
the fleet is unresponsive,

14:55.227 --> 14:57.688
and the enemy vessel
has gained tactical advantage.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.106
What are your orders?

14:59.982 --> 15:03.193
Bring us around. Charge the ion cannons.

15:04.945 --> 15:05.988
Charging cannons.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.699
Iverson,
how are the weapons systems coming?

15:08.782 --> 15:09.992
Still working on them.

15:10.242 --> 15:13.454
Sir, Sendak appears to be positioning
to strike from above.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.539
-Shields at the ready.
-Yes, sir.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.751
We have an ionic discharger online.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.545
Lock on to that cruiser. Fire when ready.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.486
What was that?

15:45.569 --> 15:47.613
The garrison is mounting a counterattack.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.908
My dad, he launched the Atlas!

15:56.372 --> 15:58.540
Jaxar Fleet, stay midrange.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.042
Bombard with covering fire.

16:00.834 --> 16:03.045
Battle Command Rall, keep them pinned in.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.223
Galra cruisers
are taking up positions around us.

16:18.435 --> 16:19.645
We need to get out there.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.981
The Atlas can't win this fight alone.

16:22.523 --> 16:23.524
Guys, I have a thought.

16:23.607 --> 16:26.318
Remember how we were able
to call the Lions to us on Earth?

16:26.402 --> 16:28.904
Why can't we do that now?
They might be able to break us out.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.282
Calling the Lions to us
and having the Lions break us out

16:32.366 --> 16:33.951
are two totally different things.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.036
I'm not saying it'll be easy.

16:36.537 --> 16:39.915
I'm not even saying that it's possible,
but we have to at least be willing to try.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.334
Think of our families.

16:44.169 --> 16:45.045
Think of Earth.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.258
Shiro said we're capable
of more than we realize.

16:49.633 --> 16:50.926
Maybe it's worth a shot.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.888
Paladins, close your eyes.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.433
Connect with your Lions.

17:16.117 --> 17:17.786
We have a problem
in the main engine!

17:17.869 --> 17:19.872
The dynotherm connections are weakening.

17:19.954 --> 17:20.830
Commander?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.624
I'm hitting them
with everything we've got,

17:22.708 --> 17:24.167
but there are just too many of them!

18:32.111 --> 18:33.195
It's working.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.908
Commander, there's something
happening with the Lions.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.785
Where are the Paladins?

18:41.620 --> 18:43.163
They're still
in their holding cells.

18:44.498 --> 18:46.834
This is their doing. Take them out.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.335
Vrepit Sa!

18:55.843 --> 18:56.885
The Atlas!

18:57.511 --> 18:59.513
It's under heavy fire.
They need our help!

19:00.097 --> 19:01.306
Lions, on me.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.277
Hello! Let me out of here, please!

19:14.236 --> 19:16.905
I know about the Earth ship.
It has a weakness.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.242
What did you say?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.870
I helped build that ship.

19:22.953 --> 19:26.165
If you were to take me to Sendak,
I could tell him where to attack.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.460
Take her to Commander Sendak.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.396
Sam, what other weapons
does this ship have?

19:49.605 --> 19:50.898
I'm really not sure.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.149
Once we added the crystal,

19:52.232 --> 19:54.610
this ship gained abilities
I never imagined.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.196
We've got incoming!

19:58.572 --> 19:59.990
Wait, they're friendly.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.162
The Lions! They escaped!

20:05.245 --> 20:06.330
- Yeah!
- Yes!

20:19.176 --> 20:20.510
Ah! Excellent!

20:20.677 --> 20:23.055
Paladins, welcome to the fight!

20:23.555 --> 20:25.390
Let's go take out Sendak's cruiser.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.309
Wait! We're still on that ship!

20:27.935 --> 20:29.311
Well, our bodies are.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.104
Amazing.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.608
We got ourselves some breathing room.
Let's make it count.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.540
You've backed yourself into a corner.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.627
Now you'll die along with the Paladins!

20:55.879 --> 20:56.964
Ah!

21:03.679 --> 21:04.846
Destroy them!

22:20.130 --> 22:20.964
Admiral.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.430
Do what I couldn't.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.644
Save Earth.

22:46.907 --> 22:47.908
We will.
