02:19.205 --> 02:21.230
Come on, Rocky, pick up the pace.
Let's get moving.

02:24.611 --> 02:25.873
Don't worry, Rocky.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.308
You know what? You take your time.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.212
Nice work.

02:32.385 --> 02:33.852
Well, maybe he needs a rest.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.681
Donna, what he needs is exercise.

02:35.855 --> 02:38.085
He's more out of shape than I am.

02:38.258 --> 02:39.282
Don't you listen to David.

02:39.459 --> 02:41.950
You are the most wonderful dog
in the whole wide world.

02:42.128 --> 02:44.858
And this afternoon, Brenda and I
are going to an animal rights meeting

02:45.031 --> 02:48.125
to make sure they never experiment
on doggies like you again.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.335
What's the matter?

02:50.503 --> 02:53.529
I think he's saying,
"Less talk, more rub. "

02:54.073 --> 02:56.234
Here, how's that?

03:00.346 --> 03:02.906
Hey, what's this?
New fashion statement, Bren?

03:03.082 --> 03:05.482
Very interesting.

03:05.652 --> 03:07.347
It's for Rocky.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.852
Although you could use it more.

03:10.557 --> 03:13.151
I didn't realize
I was dogging it these days.

03:13.326 --> 03:15.817
No, just straying a bit.

03:15.995 --> 03:18.122
So is it Kelly
you're slipping away with every night?

03:18.298 --> 03:21.734
Oh, you'd really love to see her
and Dylan break up, wouldn't you?

03:21.901 --> 03:25.064
Me? I only want what's best for you.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.728
Sorry, it's not Kelly.

03:26.906 --> 03:29.170
I didn't really think so.
You left behind your new cologne

03:29.342 --> 03:31.537
when you went off with her
last weekend.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.907
Don't you have
any ex-fiancÃ©s to harass?

03:35.481 --> 03:37.711
Brandon, it's obvious
that you're seeing someone serious.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.977
And you promised me
that I would be the first to know.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.347
Did I?

03:42.288 --> 03:44.779
Well, actually,
you're gonna be the second.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.050
Kelly already knows.

03:47.193 --> 03:48.217
Thanks a lot.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.861
Hey, I'm sorry.

03:50.029 --> 03:51.860
I had to tell her.
She's been covering for me.

03:52.665 --> 03:54.064
Why do you need a cover?

03:56.836 --> 03:58.701
Because I've been seeing Lucinda,
okay?

04:00.707 --> 04:02.368
Lucinda?

04:03.543 --> 04:05.534
As in Lucinda Nicholson,
my teacher?

04:05.712 --> 04:06.872
The same.

04:07.046 --> 04:08.775
How long has this been going on?

04:08.948 --> 04:10.677
A while.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.243
Is that why she broke up
with her husband?

04:13.419 --> 04:14.750
Man, you sound like Josh Richland.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.411
- Hey, I'm on your side.
- Good.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.555
Then you'll forget
what I just told you.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.421
My butt's hanging
way over the line on this.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.994
I'm on the task force, she's a teacher.
It's not a good thing.

04:24.163 --> 04:25.960
- I understand.
- Good.

04:26.399 --> 04:27.923
And with that, I bid you fondly.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.966
I'm going to meet Steve
at a golf course.

04:30.136 --> 04:31.660
Golf?

04:32.672 --> 04:34.970
My sentiments exactly.

04:35.808 --> 04:39.642
You and Lucinda Nicholson.
That is so hot.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.007
Sorry, not another word.

04:52.725 --> 04:54.818
One decaf.

04:54.994 --> 04:56.256
<i>Oh, the new Condor.</i>

04:56.429 --> 04:59.455
I see that the animal rights issue
made front-page news.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.293
Yeah, it would seem
the trustees are voting

05:01.467 --> 05:04.300
whether or not to ban animal testing
in all the university labs.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.166
Yeah, Donna and Brenda
are really getting into the thick of it.

05:07.340 --> 05:10.537
So where do you stand?
Testing or no testing?

05:10.710 --> 05:13.508
Well, I don't know. I think equating
the death of broiler chickens

05:13.680 --> 05:15.307
<i>to Schindler's List is a little extreme,</i>

05:15.481 --> 05:19.178
but a lot of it's cruel
and unnecessary.

05:19.352 --> 05:21.547
Did the article on Brandon
come out yet?

05:21.721 --> 05:25.885
No, but they have some lovely
candid shots of your weekend there.

05:27.727 --> 05:30.423
That was taken at a square dance.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.956
How many do-si-dos
did you and your partner do?

05:33.566 --> 05:34.931
Please.

05:35.101 --> 05:37.592
Well, you do take a lot of what
Lucinda Nicholson says to heart.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.670
And, Kel, we both know the woman
defines monogamy

05:39.839 --> 05:42.364
as jumping into the sack
with one person at a time.

05:42.542 --> 05:45.568
I don't get it. Why do you have
all this animosity towards Lucinda?

05:45.745 --> 05:46.973
I'm just kidding, Kel.

05:47.146 --> 05:48.613
No, I don't think so.

05:48.781 --> 05:52.080
In fact, I think that the real reason you
don't wanna finance her documentary

05:52.251 --> 05:54.651
is because she is a strong woman
with a feminist point of view

05:54.821 --> 05:55.845
and you can't handle it.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.455
Yeah. Can you picture this?

05:57.623 --> 05:59.523
Me standing there quaking
in the shadow

05:59.692 --> 06:03.526
of Lucinda Nicholson's
gargantuan feminist intellect.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.958
Well, all I know is last week,
you loved her proposal.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.998
And this week I decided
not to back the project.

06:09.168 --> 06:10.567
I have the right to change my mind.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.432
Yes, you do.

06:12.605 --> 06:15.369
But let's just have her over for dinner
and we'll talk this out.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.565
Kel...

06:16.743 --> 06:19.075
If you still don't wanna back the film,
I will understand.

06:19.245 --> 06:20.837
But if we don't give her
a second chance,

06:21.013 --> 06:22.878
she's just gonna think
we're a bunch of kids,

06:23.049 --> 06:25.540
and I wouldn't be able
to face her again.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.344
I don't know.

06:29.122 --> 06:32.182
Come on. Please.

06:33.025 --> 06:36.017
You're cheating. You know that.

06:37.463 --> 06:39.021
Thank you.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.728
Hey, I thought you were Walsh's girl.

06:45.605 --> 06:47.163
Brandon and I are just friends.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.705
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.639
Last weekend, it looked like you guys
were practically swapping spit.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.746
Why don't you do the planet a favor?
Call Dr. Kevorkian.

07:07.126 --> 07:09.094
Steve, I've known you
for four years, man.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.695
When did you learn how to play golf?

07:10.863 --> 07:12.956
Well, it's like driving a car, Brandon.

07:13.132 --> 07:15.100
Once you learn how to do it,
it's natural.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.792
So you've had a few lessons, huh?

07:16.969 --> 07:18.766
Well, when I was
in junior high school,

07:18.938 --> 07:22.169
my dad tried to turn me
into the next Jack Nicklaus.

07:24.644 --> 07:27.044
Well, I'd say he did a pretty good job.

07:27.213 --> 07:30.774
You know, C.U.'s got a golf team.
You should try and go out for it.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.417
There's no way.

07:32.585 --> 07:35.520
If I join the golf team, that would
make my father way too happy.

07:35.688 --> 07:37.588
Seriously, if playing golf
is so painful for you,

07:37.757 --> 07:40.089
how come you entered in this
father-and-son golf tournament?

07:40.259 --> 07:41.988
No, never mind me.
What's up with you, pal?

07:42.161 --> 07:44.493
What's going on with you and Kelly?
People are talking.

07:44.664 --> 07:48.498
Yeah, well, people have
empty, squalid lives, Steve.

07:49.101 --> 07:50.659
Come on, Brandon. Confess, deny,

07:50.837 --> 07:53.533
show me a secret video,
a Polaroid, anything.

07:55.241 --> 07:57.038
It's just politics, man.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.179
She helps me out with the task force
and that's all that's on the agenda.

08:00.746 --> 08:01.906
I am sorry to hear that, man.

08:02.081 --> 08:05.107
I was hoping you were
a better politician than that.

08:12.625 --> 08:15.958
In the past year alone, the movement
has had enormous successes.

08:16.128 --> 08:20.121
Burdick Industries halted
their barbaric experiments

08:20.299 --> 08:22.563
on one-week-old puppies.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.726
Arcadia University suspended funding

08:24.904 --> 08:28.271
for a series of grotesque experiments
on pregnant monkeys.

08:28.441 --> 08:32.467
Look, we have every reason
to believe that the board of trustees

08:32.645 --> 08:37.082
is going to vote to ban all
animal testing at California University

08:37.250 --> 08:39.241
when they convene
in two days, people.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.578
But to make sure
that they decide to do the right thing,

08:41.754 --> 08:44.222
it's really important that we have
a huge turnout at the rally.

08:44.390 --> 08:47.188
That's right. So thank you for your
passion and your commitment.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.828
- And we'll see you then.
- Thanks.

08:49.996 --> 08:52.965
- So, what are you gonna do now?
- I don't know.

08:53.132 --> 08:55.396
Allan, that was incredible.
And I just want you to know

08:55.568 --> 08:57.468
that Donna and I will do
anything we can to help.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.468
Great. So how's Rocky?
Have you heard anything?

08:59.639 --> 09:01.163
Yeah, we just got him back
from the lab.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.535
That's great.
Let's hope he's all right.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.472
A lot of times,
these animals are really sick.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.704
- Oh, not Rocky.
- Well, that's good.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.314
And thanks for all your help.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.476
So, what do you think?

09:13.653 --> 09:16.213
I'd march in his army any day.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.827
Well, it looks like your task force
accomplished its mission.

09:23.996 --> 09:25.520
Yeah, and you know,
the best part for me

09:25.698 --> 09:28.531
was how we worked out a national
strategy with the other schools.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.532
Dylan didn't mind
you going off with Kelly?

09:30.703 --> 09:33.763
Well, why should he?
I mean, they're not an item.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.674
- Are they?
- No, mother.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.035
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, Bren.

09:40.212 --> 09:42.373
- What's that smell?
- Dinner.

09:42.548 --> 09:43.572
It's red meat, isn't it?

09:44.517 --> 09:47.247
I'll pass. There's no way
that I can eat animal flesh.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.285
Not after the meeting
I just came from.

09:49.455 --> 09:51.446
That was
that animal rights thing, right?

09:51.624 --> 09:53.785
Yes. And it was quite an education.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.088
You know, we have no right
to impose our power on other species.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.527
It is totally immoral.
We might as well eat our young.

09:59.699 --> 10:01.633
Listen, Bren,
if you wanna become a vegetarian,

10:01.801 --> 10:05.066
that's really cool,
but before you get too crazy,

10:05.237 --> 10:07.398
those boots aren't exactly made
out of broccoli, chief.

10:08.307 --> 10:12.175
Brandon, I'm changing my diet first,
then my leather products.

10:13.012 --> 10:14.502
Okay.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.373
I'll get it.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.210
Why can't she ever
do anything halfway?

10:24.223 --> 10:25.281
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.255
Is Brandon here?

10:27.760 --> 10:28.920
Brandon, Kelly's here.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.433
You know.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.396
So, what's the problem?

10:40.573 --> 10:43.041
Dylan doesn't wanna back
Lucinda's film.

10:43.209 --> 10:47.077
But he's willing to have dinner with her
to reconsider the whole thing.

10:47.246 --> 10:50.545
And I still think that there's
a good chance he can come around.

10:50.716 --> 10:51.876
Lf...

10:52.685 --> 10:53.709
If what?

10:53.886 --> 10:55.513
If you'll come to dinner too.

10:57.123 --> 10:59.921
Kelly, the fewer people that know
about me and Lucinda, the better.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.159
Yeah, I know.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.820
But he's getting
a little weird about you and me.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.062
I just don't think it'll work
unless you come.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.233
You didn't tell him what almost
happened between us, did you?

11:13.873 --> 11:17.309
<i>No, but he saw the picture
in the Condor.</i>

11:17.476 --> 11:21.207
And even though he says he's joking,
obviously it's bothering him.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.815
Great.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.517
But if he sees
that you're dating Lucinda,

11:26.686 --> 11:28.278
then it could just
smooth everything over.

11:28.454 --> 11:30.513
Kelly, I am not dating Lucinda.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.851
We're just sleeping together.

11:34.493 --> 11:35.721
Why won't he back her film?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.664
I think it's because
he's intimidated by her.

11:39.465 --> 11:41.490
But if he sees
that you're comfortable with her,

11:41.667 --> 11:44.067
then he'll be comfortable
with her too.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.802
Hurry, David. I think he needs water.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.510
There you go, boy.

11:51.677 --> 11:54.771
Look, Rocky, doesn't that look nice?

11:54.947 --> 11:56.278
Rocky.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.940
What's the matter with him?
He won't eat, he won't drink.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.853
He hasn't been right all day, Donna.

12:02.354 --> 12:04.151
Should I give him some food?

12:04.323 --> 12:06.188
I already tried that.

12:07.493 --> 12:10.826
Listen, first thing tomorrow morning,
I'm gonna take him to the vet.

12:10.996 --> 12:12.725
Well, you don't think he's sick,
do you?

12:12.898 --> 12:14.456
I don't know, but we gotta find out.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.865
David, what if something's
wrong with him?

12:17.036 --> 12:19.197
Don't worry, we'll take care of him.

12:20.539 --> 12:22.632
Come on, Rocky. Good boy.

12:22.808 --> 12:25.333
Look. Good boy.

12:25.511 --> 12:27.445
Yeah, see, it's gonna be all right.

12:28.881 --> 12:30.815
It'll be all right.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.623
You're mad, aren't you?

12:47.800 --> 12:50.792
No. More like betrayed.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.904
I'm sorry.

12:53.072 --> 12:56.838
Keeping us a secret from everyone
has been next to impossible.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.775
Who else knows besides Kelly?

13:01.180 --> 13:02.374
My sister.

13:02.548 --> 13:05.676
Swell. Two students from my class.

13:06.352 --> 13:07.376
It's a nightmare.

13:07.553 --> 13:10.021
I could've just blown Kelly off,
told her dinner was a bad idea

13:10.189 --> 13:11.315
and you never would've known.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.822
You couldn't even keep a secret
about not keeping a secret.

13:13.993 --> 13:16.325
No. I know how much
your film means to you.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.429
And I know how little
the money means to Dylan.

13:19.231 --> 13:21.563
Listen, Brandon,
I've already embarrassed myself once.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.202
Okay, Dylan made up his mind,
he didn't wanna get involved.

13:24.370 --> 13:25.860
- Let's move on, okay?
- Lucinda.

13:26.038 --> 13:27.130
If you get your film funded,

13:27.306 --> 13:29.171
then maybe you can become
a full-time filmmaker.

13:29.341 --> 13:31.605
Then just maybe you and I
can go out in public somewhere.

13:31.777 --> 13:33.506
You ever think of that?

13:35.214 --> 13:36.681
Yeah.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.245
Look, I'm sorry.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.943
I know you're under pressure too.

13:42.388 --> 13:43.480
And I know Dylan.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.389
If all of us are there
and we work him a little bit,

13:46.559 --> 13:47.787
maybe he'll come around.

13:49.228 --> 13:50.957
And you're willing
to help convince him?

13:53.098 --> 13:54.759
Funny,
that's what I've been trying to say.

13:59.605 --> 14:01.800
Ms. Nicholson,
can I talk to you a minute?

14:02.241 --> 14:05.301
Oh, man, it's Josh Richland.
You gotta get rid of him.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.508
- Yes?
- Hi.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.174
<i>I'm Josh Richland from the Condor.</i>

14:13.352 --> 14:15.183
I hope this isn't about a subscription.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.378
No.

14:16.555 --> 14:18.785
I guess this is a bad time,
but I'd like to interview you

14:18.958 --> 14:21.324
for an article I'm finishing up
on Brandon Walsh.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.654
You know Brandon, right?

14:23.829 --> 14:25.262
Sure.

14:26.131 --> 14:28.361
Why don't you come by my office
tomorrow and we can talk?

14:29.101 --> 14:31.092
Okay. That was easy.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.000
- Have a good night.
- You too.

14:37.142 --> 14:38.200
How'd he know I was here?

14:38.377 --> 14:41.710
I have no idea, but I can't dodge
any more bullets like that.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.041
Me neither.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.683
So we'll do the dinner
tomorrow night?

14:47.586 --> 14:49.816
You, me, Kelly and Dylan.

14:52.558 --> 14:56.961
Yeah, maybe it does have
its possibilities.

15:10.776 --> 15:12.141
I've never thrown a dinner party.

15:12.311 --> 15:15.246
I probably bought way too much food,
but I'm still nervous it's not enough.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.941
Well, as long as there are
no more surprise guests.

15:19.118 --> 15:21.348
You're not upset with me
for inviting Brandon, are you?

15:21.520 --> 15:23.249
No, of course not.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.050
I really appreciate
all the trouble you're going to.

15:26.225 --> 15:27.749
Anything to help.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.452
Your weekend with Brandon seems
to have done him a world of good.

15:30.629 --> 15:32.790
I don't know what went on up there,
but whatever it was,

15:32.965 --> 15:34.762
he's come back a new man.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.302
Come to tomorrow's rally.
Stand up for animal rights.

15:38.470 --> 15:41.200
Don't let the torture
of innocent animals go on any longer.

15:41.373 --> 15:43.000
- What's up, Bren?
- Hey.

15:43.175 --> 15:44.733
David, what did the vet say
about Rocky?

15:44.910 --> 15:47.344
Not too much.
But he seems to be doing better.

15:47.513 --> 15:50.175
- Did he have anything to eat?
- Yeah, I fed him when we got home.

15:51.016 --> 15:52.244
That is such a relief.

15:52.985 --> 15:55.044
Oh, Andrea, you know about
tomorrow's rally, right?

15:55.220 --> 15:57.381
You guys know
how I feel about this stuff.

15:57.556 --> 15:59.786
Why don't you just come over
and look at some literature?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.325
- It might change your mind.
- All right.

16:03.595 --> 16:05.756
Listen, Bren,
I finally got Rocky's blood test back,

16:05.931 --> 16:09.628
and the vet says there's
nothing more he can do for him.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.433
He has cancer.

16:13.405 --> 16:15.305
Oh, my God.

16:16.008 --> 16:19.239
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about Donna. I mean, should I tell her?

16:19.912 --> 16:21.607
You might wanna wait
for the right time.

16:23.382 --> 16:24.781
Yeah.

16:26.218 --> 16:27.242
I'll see you later.

16:27.419 --> 16:28.909
Bye.

16:34.026 --> 16:37.427
I can't believe you guys are involved
with this mindless kind of radicalism.

16:37.596 --> 16:38.927
It isn't mindless.

16:39.098 --> 16:42.067
You're always the one who believes
in standing up for a good cause.

16:42.234 --> 16:44.532
That is, unless you think
the abuse of innocent animals

16:44.703 --> 16:46.227
doesn't count for anything.

16:46.405 --> 16:49.272
You know, Brenda,
there is another side to this.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.341
Come on,
I wanna show you something.

16:55.614 --> 16:57.138
If you guys
are gonna protest something,

16:57.316 --> 17:00.217
at least see what it's all about
before you try to tear it apart.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.445
Welcome to Lab 33.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.583
- What are they doing?
- Behavioral research.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.589
They're studying
the sleeping patterns of cats.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.926
Oh, that's just what the world needs.

17:10.095 --> 17:11.460
Bren, have a little faith.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.997
The work here may be the only hope
we have in finding a cure for SIDS.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.896
Wait, Andrea,
speak English or I'm leaving.

17:18.069 --> 17:21.631
I'm sorry, SIDS is short
for sudden infant death syndrome.

17:21.807 --> 17:24.298
It's the leading killer
of babies in their first year of life.

17:24.476 --> 17:26.944
That's right, I've heard of it.
They don't know what causes it.

17:27.112 --> 17:30.343
That's what's so heartbreaking.
I mean, there are no warning signs.

17:30.516 --> 17:34.350
Every year, 10,000 babies die of crib
death because we don't understand

17:34.520 --> 17:37.011
how the brain controls
breathing during sleep.

17:37.189 --> 17:39.384
I'm sure putting electrodes
in these animals' skulls

17:39.558 --> 17:41.025
isn't very pleasant for them either.

17:41.193 --> 17:45.095
I know it looks awful,
but they don't feel a thing.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.856
You guys,
I had the same concerns you did.

17:47.032 --> 17:48.624
But I checked out
Dr. Reardon's approach.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.861
She does everything possible
to minimize suffering.

17:52.037 --> 17:53.197
So that makes it all right?

17:54.039 --> 17:55.904
You know, it may seem cruel,

17:56.075 --> 17:58.509
but if experimenting on these animals
can help find a cure,

17:58.677 --> 18:00.440
I'm sorry, I can live with that.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.774
I mean, who knows?

18:02.948 --> 18:07.248
What's learned here
could maybe help save my baby's life.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.214
I had no idea.

18:12.958 --> 18:16.257
Look, maybe this lab
is doing worthwhile research,

18:16.428 --> 18:18.123
but I'm sure that it's the exception.

18:19.398 --> 18:20.956
- Look, Brenda...
- Andrea.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.226
You have your opinion
and I have mine, okay?

18:26.271 --> 18:28.466
Donna, come on, let's go.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.489
Very impressive.
Where'd you get all this stuff?

18:44.656 --> 18:49.753
It pays to have a mother with fine taste
in crystal and bone china.

18:49.928 --> 18:52.226
I wouldn't know.
Be sure and tell me which fork to use.

18:52.397 --> 18:54.695
All right, maybe I should take away
the floral arrangement.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.061
Kel, relax. It's perfect.

18:56.235 --> 18:59.329
Really, everything looks great.
Why the fourth setting, though?

18:59.505 --> 19:02.440
I was gonna just tell you about that.

19:02.608 --> 19:06.601
See, it's been kind of a hectic day,
and you were out surfing.

19:06.778 --> 19:09.770
Well, I invited
Lucinda's boyfriend to come.

19:09.948 --> 19:11.040
She has a boyfriend already?

19:11.216 --> 19:13.582
The woman's been divorced
for 15 minutes. Who is this guy?

19:13.752 --> 19:14.946
He must be a piece of work.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.382
Actually, it's Brandon.

19:22.794 --> 19:25.194
Don't you think you'd better get that?

19:36.708 --> 19:38.801
Lucinda, Brandon.

19:38.977 --> 19:40.410
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.610
Dylan, this place is incredible.

19:43.782 --> 19:45.443
California Craftsman.
When was it built?

19:45.617 --> 19:46.982
Late teens, early '20s?

19:47.152 --> 19:49.382
Something like that, yeah.

19:49.555 --> 19:50.988
Why don't I give you the grand tour?

19:51.156 --> 19:52.453
Yes.

19:55.060 --> 19:57.756
Well, bro,
I guess the cat's out of the bag.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.831
I would say the cat hasn't even begun
to show her face yet, man.

20:00.999 --> 20:04.457
But since when did Lucinda
recruit you for fundraising duty?

20:04.870 --> 20:07.737
Hey, it's a great project.
You said so yourself.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.598
Did I say that?

20:20.686 --> 20:23.621
Come on, Rocky.
Come on, take your medicine.

20:24.156 --> 20:26.954
Come on, I know it doesn't taste good,
but it's gonna make you all well.

20:28.093 --> 20:29.685
Come on.

20:30.362 --> 20:32.296
What are we gonna do?

20:33.865 --> 20:36.834
Maybe if we put a blanket over him
to keep him warm.

20:37.002 --> 20:38.594
I'll get it.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.840
Listen, Donna, I don't think
you should expect too much.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.768
What do you mean?
You said he was getting better.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.207
Yeah, well, I didn't wanna hurt you,

20:51.316 --> 20:53.045
but the fact is, he's pretty sick.

20:55.354 --> 20:59.154
Well, that's why he has to take
his medicine so he can get well, right?

21:01.460 --> 21:03.451
You've gotta tell her, David.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.120
Tell me what?

21:08.567 --> 21:10.194
Donna...

21:12.738 --> 21:14.171
Rocky has cancer.

21:14.873 --> 21:16.238
Cancer?

21:17.576 --> 21:20.875
Yeah. The vet says he thinks
it's about time we put him to sleep.

21:23.081 --> 21:26.244
How can you say that?
He's gonna get well, okay?

21:27.953 --> 21:30.421
Yeah. You're gonna be okay.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.196
<i>Kelly, this crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e is delicious.
Did you make it yourself?</i>

21:44.369 --> 21:46.166
I bought it myself.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.067
No, thanks, Kel. Really, it's great.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.071
You know,
you might wanna consider

21:50.242 --> 21:53.268
letting Kel here work on the old menu
there at chez Peach Pit.

21:53.945 --> 21:55.173
Maybe.

21:55.347 --> 21:58.009
Well, why don't we get back
to why we're here?

21:58.183 --> 22:00.344
Brandon, you've seen the film.
What do you think?

22:01.086 --> 22:03.748
I'm far more interested
in what Dylan thinks of it.

22:04.289 --> 22:07.156
Well, I'm no Roger Ebert,
but it looked okay to me.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.294
I hope you have good luck with it.

22:09.461 --> 22:11.019
Thank you.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.664
Maybe you could go over your
marketing ideas for us one more time.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.267
We've already done that.

22:17.436 --> 22:19.734
There is money to be made
when it's sold to television.

22:20.472 --> 22:21.837
I mean, it has a built-in audience.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.532
Every woman in America
is gonna wanna see it.

22:25.110 --> 22:28.307
Sounds like what you guys need
is a woman producer,

22:28.480 --> 22:29.970
a woman distributor.

22:34.486 --> 22:37.387
You know, Lucinda,
I think it's probably time we left.

22:37.889 --> 22:40.881
Yeah, I think we reached that point
a long time ago.

22:41.493 --> 22:44.360
- Kelly, thanks for everything.
- Thanks.

22:48.066 --> 22:51.399
You guys, look, I'm really sorry.
I don't know what got into him.

22:51.570 --> 22:54.334
- It's okay. Don't be mad at him.
- No, be furious. Good night.

22:54.506 --> 22:57.031
- Good night, Kelly.
- Bye.

23:05.984 --> 23:09.112
Thank you for ruining
my first dinner party.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.647
I just didn't know
any other way to handle it.

23:12.324 --> 23:15.316
You know, I don't care so much
that you don't wanna help her out.

23:15.494 --> 23:18.554
But I don't understand
why you had to be so rude.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.288
She's somebody
who means a lot to me.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.524
Why? When you grow up,
you wanna be just like her?

23:22.701 --> 23:24.794
Yeah, maybe I do.

23:24.970 --> 23:26.130
You know what?

23:26.671 --> 23:28.969
The only person that you hurt
here tonight was yourself.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.933
This is gonna be a great film
and you're not gonna be part of it.

23:32.110 --> 23:34.476
Don't worry about me, Kel.
Worry about Brandon.

23:35.113 --> 23:38.310
Why? Because he's got
an incredible woman?

23:39.618 --> 23:41.950
What? Are you jealous?

23:42.120 --> 23:43.382
Yeah.

23:43.555 --> 23:46.888
Yeah, your role model,
she is so incredible.

23:47.058 --> 23:50.084
When you and Brandon were having
your little square dance last weekend,

23:50.262 --> 23:52.958
she tried to use some of that
Guatemalan mumbo jumbo

23:53.131 --> 23:54.223
to get me into bed.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.901
What are you talking about? Why
would she do something like that?

23:58.069 --> 23:59.696
You think she wants
your money so bad?

23:59.871 --> 24:01.202
Well, I thought so at first.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.933
But actually, I think
it's a little more basic than that, Kel.

24:04.109 --> 24:07.101
I just happened to be
the closest available warm body.

24:09.381 --> 24:10.575
You have lost it.

24:11.983 --> 24:14.110
Hey, how nice
was I supposed to be, huh?

24:14.619 --> 24:16.712
Did you want me to sleep with her?

24:28.133 --> 24:30.158
He ate and slept?

24:30.335 --> 24:32.565
Well, Donna, that's great.

24:33.338 --> 24:35.169
- What's crazy?
- Oh, nothing.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.638
I was just thinking that maybe
the reason Rocky chose us

24:37.809 --> 24:39.674
is because he knew
we could help him get better.

24:39.845 --> 24:42.143
Well, you're certainly
making me feel better.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.442
Look, I've got to go if I'm gonna
catch a ride with my mom to school.

24:45.617 --> 24:46.845
So I'll see you at the rally.

24:47.385 --> 24:50.411
Yeah. I just hope Andrea
understands why we're doing it.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.386
Let's hope
the board of trustees understands.

24:52.557 --> 24:54.457
Get there early, all right?
We wanna be in front.

24:54.626 --> 24:56.025
Okay. Bye.

24:57.062 --> 24:58.529
Rocky's feeling better, huh?

24:58.697 --> 25:00.130
Yeah, he had a good night's sleep.

25:00.298 --> 25:01.322
At least somebody did.

25:02.467 --> 25:05.994
Why? Your double date
get a little confusing?

25:06.171 --> 25:07.433
Dylan totally bailed.

25:07.606 --> 25:09.198
You know,
I'm actually starting to believe

25:09.374 --> 25:12.207
he thinks something's going on
between me and Kelly.

25:12.377 --> 25:13.708
Is there?

25:13.879 --> 25:16.939
That's why I shouldn't be telling you
these things. Have fun at your rally.

25:17.115 --> 25:19.549
We will. Today is the day
C.U. Stops animal testing.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.709
- I'm sure they will.
- Be there or beware.

25:21.887 --> 25:22.911
Give them hell, sis.

25:23.088 --> 25:24.988
Now get out of here.

25:30.929 --> 25:33.056
Are Brenda and Donna running late?

25:33.231 --> 25:35.631
They're at the animal rights rally,
no doubt.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.529
Good for them.

25:37.936 --> 25:41.736
But they're going to miss
our class on folk medicine.

25:41.907 --> 25:43.135
I brought in some artifacts.

25:43.775 --> 25:45.265
Yeah, Kelly?

25:45.443 --> 25:49.004
I didn't think we finished
Wednesday's discussion on fidelity.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.408
Oh, I think it ran its course.

25:51.550 --> 25:56.078
I didn't think we ever really explored
the concept of betrayal.

25:58.123 --> 26:00.182
Well, if you're looking
for an anthropological model,

26:00.358 --> 26:01.723
you can try the Eskimos.

26:02.594 --> 26:04.255
Do they go after each other's mates?

26:05.630 --> 26:08.098
As a matter of fact,
when a man goes off hunting,

26:08.266 --> 26:10.166
he expects other men
to satisfy his wife.

26:10.635 --> 26:12.603
And when the women
go off gathering,

26:12.771 --> 26:14.966
do other women
head straight for their boyfriends?

26:16.341 --> 26:17.740
They might.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.605
It's so much a part of their culture,
they even have a word for it.

26:22.247 --> 26:26.547
It describes the close bond
they all feel for sharing the same lover.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.289
Fortunately, we are not Eskimos.

26:31.456 --> 26:32.480
Or are we?

26:33.692 --> 26:35.683
Kelly, we talked about
how men and women

26:35.860 --> 26:37.623
aren't monogamous by nature.

26:38.296 --> 26:39.786
Traditional monogamy only works

26:39.965 --> 26:42.058
when everyone adheres
to the same morality.

26:43.134 --> 26:47.537
So going after a friend's husband
is actually a natural reflex?

26:48.607 --> 26:50.336
Not quite.

26:50.508 --> 26:55.445
But I do believe, like the Eskimos,
that relationships can be healthier

26:55.614 --> 26:58.412
if people are more honest with each
other about their sexual impulses.

27:01.219 --> 27:03.483
And that's as honest as I can be.

27:03.955 --> 27:05.081
Does that make sense?

27:06.224 --> 27:07.521
Yeah, I'm afraid it does.

27:07.692 --> 27:09.683
Okay. Well, if you all
wanna come up to my desk,

27:09.861 --> 27:11.761
you could check out
some of these different items

27:11.930 --> 27:14.421
which were used by women
who were healers.

27:14.599 --> 27:17.397
The board of trustees' meeting
will be letting out at any minute.

27:17.569 --> 27:20.697
Victory is only seconds away.

27:20.872 --> 27:23.898
An important victory
with historical significance.

27:24.075 --> 27:27.670
Because for once,
this campus is going on record

27:27.846 --> 27:30.747
as saying that life, in all its forms,

27:30.915 --> 27:34.578
is more important than profits.

27:39.024 --> 27:42.619
You can all be proud of yourselves
because we all did it together.

27:55.573 --> 28:01.808
I've just been informed that despite
their assurances to the contrary,

28:01.980 --> 28:05.040
the board of trustees
has voted to table the issue.

28:06.718 --> 28:07.912
What does that mean?

28:08.086 --> 28:10.281
It means
that they've postponed the vote.

28:10.455 --> 28:12.787
They've avoided taking a position.

28:13.491 --> 28:17.086
Therefore, funding
for animal research continues.

28:17.796 --> 28:20.492
- They can't get away with this.
- They promised us.

28:20.665 --> 28:22.530
Animal rights now!

28:22.701 --> 28:24.931
Animal rights now! Come on!

28:25.103 --> 28:28.300
<i>Animal rights now.
Animal rights now.</i>

28:28.473 --> 28:31.408
<i>Animal rights now.
Animal rights now.</i>

28:31.576 --> 28:35.273
Here comes Callahan.
He's one of the trustees.

28:35.447 --> 28:37.847
- Killer!
- Get out of here.

28:50.995 --> 28:53.691
Move out of the way
and let him go, please.

28:55.366 --> 28:58.164
Hey, stop it!
This is a movement against violence.

29:07.011 --> 29:09.605
All right, what do you say
we name him Emmanuel?

29:09.781 --> 29:11.373
For me,
it'd be after my cousin Manny.

29:11.549 --> 29:13.141
And for Andrea,
it'd be after the temple.

29:13.318 --> 29:15.013
- That's good, that's good.
- Right.

29:15.186 --> 29:18.121
And if it's a girl, what, maybe
we should name her Beth Israel.

29:18.289 --> 29:19.779
Well, I'm not gonna
name him Guacamole.

29:19.958 --> 29:20.982
I didn't say Guacamole.

29:21.159 --> 29:23.923
I suggested,
merely suggested, Margarita.

29:24.629 --> 29:26.460
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Kel.

29:26.631 --> 29:29.031
Wanna sit down
and help us with baby names?

29:29.200 --> 29:30.224
- Brandon.
- No.

29:30.401 --> 29:33.495
We've actually got some business
to discuss. Excuse us.

29:37.175 --> 29:39.973
- Thanks for meeting me.
- You're welcome. What's up?

29:40.678 --> 29:42.612
I don't really know where to start.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.614
You think there's something
going on with them?

29:46.117 --> 29:48.517
I don't know.
I mean, I never would have thought so,

29:48.686 --> 29:51.211
but you should've seen Kelly
in class today.

29:51.389 --> 29:54.722
I mean, she and Lucinda were
supposedly discussing monogamy,

29:54.893 --> 29:57.487
but there was, I don't know,
a whole lot more going on

29:57.662 --> 29:59.721
than a theoretical discussion.

30:00.331 --> 30:03.425
So that's why Dylan's
been acting so weird.

30:03.601 --> 30:05.626
Do you think it could be true?

30:05.804 --> 30:07.669
She's certainly capable of it.

30:07.839 --> 30:11.798
It's not as if she's ever claimed
to be anything other than what she is.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.739
I just never thought
she'd try it with Dylan.

30:13.912 --> 30:16.380
Any more than Dylan ever thought
I would try it with you.

30:18.116 --> 30:20.914
At least some of us know
when to stop ourselves.

30:22.420 --> 30:24.911
But did we stop ourselves
any sooner than Dylan did?

30:25.089 --> 30:28.820
I mean, maybe Lucinda's right.
Maybe under the right circumstances,

30:28.993 --> 30:30.790
we are all capable of betrayal.

30:32.630 --> 30:34.655
This is really bad.

30:35.733 --> 30:37.724
If I wanna have
an honest relationship with Dylan,

30:37.902 --> 30:39.893
I am gonna have to tell him

30:40.071 --> 30:42.437
what happened
between you and me at the retreat.

30:43.474 --> 30:45.465
No, I think
you should let me tell him.

30:45.643 --> 30:46.667
No.

30:47.245 --> 30:51.204
I think it would be best
if I was the one to tell him first.

31:04.462 --> 31:07.625
Come on. Just hang on, Rocky.

31:07.799 --> 31:08.857
Hang on.

31:09.434 --> 31:11.299
You're gonna be all right.

31:12.737 --> 31:15.171
Maybe he'd be more comfortable
if we just let him rest.

31:17.408 --> 31:19.740
I'll just get him some more medicine.

31:22.146 --> 31:23.943
Donna, look.

31:24.949 --> 31:26.439
Maybe you should
just let him go, okay?

31:26.618 --> 31:29.018
I mean, this is no way for him to live.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.181
How can you say that?

31:40.098 --> 31:42.396
Guys, I think he's stopped breathing.

31:44.035 --> 31:45.662
No.

31:46.237 --> 31:49.229
Donna. Donna, I'm sorry.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.238
No.

31:51.409 --> 31:54.344
Brenda, they killed him.

31:54.512 --> 31:56.377
You know that they killed him.

31:58.116 --> 32:00.380
It's just not fair.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.251
They won't get away with this,
Donna.

32:04.789 --> 32:06.279
I won't let them.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.937
You're late. Not like you.

32:27.111 --> 32:32.014
Yeah, well, I got held up
at the Peach Pit talking to Kelly.

32:32.850 --> 32:34.408
I see.

32:35.053 --> 32:37.988
- And now you're all upset.
- Is it true?

32:38.756 --> 32:40.280
There are some things
I need to say...

32:40.458 --> 32:43.393
Why don't you tell me what went on
between you and Dylan?

32:44.395 --> 32:45.919
Are you hungry?

32:46.364 --> 32:48.229
Because I've got
some food over here.

32:48.399 --> 32:49.696
What went on?

32:49.867 --> 32:51.459
Nothing.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.467
When Dylan was here last weekend,

32:53.638 --> 32:55.469
things might have been taken
the wrong way.

32:57.075 --> 33:00.169
I thought he was more like you.
More like me.

33:00.345 --> 33:03.906
So in other words,
you came on to him?

33:04.082 --> 33:05.674
We flirted a little bit.

33:07.151 --> 33:10.211
But I do get the sense
that he was offended.

33:11.723 --> 33:14.521
You make this all sound
so matter-of-fact.

33:14.892 --> 33:15.916
What about us?

33:16.361 --> 33:18.329
Come on, Brandon.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.157
When I did
my Richland interview yesterday,

33:20.331 --> 33:22.959
he told me how cuddly you and Kelly
were up at the retreat.

33:23.968 --> 33:25.993
Now, how is it any different?

33:28.439 --> 33:29.997
Because I feel bad about that.

33:31.976 --> 33:33.170
Dylan's an old friend.

33:34.846 --> 33:38.338
Well, if he is, he'll understand.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.382
Just like I do.

33:40.918 --> 33:43.011
Right, of course.

33:43.187 --> 33:46.748
You have a convenient philosophy
for everything.

33:46.924 --> 33:48.755
Brandon, listen to me.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.391
What happened between me
and Dylan

33:50.561 --> 33:53.394
in no way changes or diminishes
what I feel for you.

33:54.632 --> 33:56.862
I thought you might say that.

33:57.402 --> 33:58.596
But I gotta tell you something.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.397
I don't know
what you are to me anymore.

34:05.109 --> 34:06.804
A fantasy.

34:07.612 --> 34:09.476
Just like you are to me.

34:14.284 --> 34:15.411
No, thanks.

34:27.665 --> 34:29.360
So then we called the vet.

34:29.534 --> 34:31.263
And they said we needed to decide

34:31.436 --> 34:34.030
whether we wanted him
cremated or buried.

34:34.205 --> 34:36.605
You mean, like in a pet cemetery?

34:37.241 --> 34:38.639
Yeah.

34:38.810 --> 34:41.802
I just...
I don't know if I can handle that.

34:42.513 --> 34:46.882
I mean, I want a memorial for him.

34:47.051 --> 34:49.518
You know,
something to remember him by.

34:49.687 --> 34:52.053
I know. It's gonna be okay.

34:52.824 --> 34:55.418
You know, I read somewhere
that the loss of a pet

34:55.592 --> 34:58.255
is actually harder to handle
than the loss of another human being.

34:58.930 --> 35:02.923
I mean, with other people,
our feelings are so complicated.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.535
But with a dog or a cat,
it's just about love.

35:07.038 --> 35:08.062
I know.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.133
So how's Brenda?

35:11.309 --> 35:13.777
She must have had
a hard time with this too.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.243
Yeah, she's pretty torn up about it.

35:18.182 --> 35:19.809
I guess it was a rough week
for all of us.

35:21.519 --> 35:22.645
Why? What's the matter?

35:25.156 --> 35:28.216
I just finished telling Dylan the truth
about my weekend with Brandon.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.388
It was awfully nice
of you and your father

35:33.564 --> 35:35.498
to invite Brandon and Jim
to go golfing next week.

35:35.666 --> 35:37.634
Now if I can only uninvite myself.

35:48.346 --> 35:50.906
- Hi, Dylan.
- Hi.

35:51.082 --> 35:53.812
Well, hurry on in, boys, I'm gonna
put some brownies in the microwave.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.009
Great.

35:55.186 --> 35:56.881
Hey, D. Good to see you.

35:57.054 --> 35:59.454
Yeah, I think we need to have us
a little man-to-man, Brandon.

35:59.624 --> 36:02.457
Yeah, I was coming over to see you
regarding the same matter.

36:02.627 --> 36:04.993
- Come on inside.
- No, I think right here's just fine.

36:06.264 --> 36:08.061
What's going on, ladies?

36:08.232 --> 36:11.395
It's private, Steve. Would you mind
taking these in to my mother?

36:11.569 --> 36:12.968
Yeah.

36:17.074 --> 36:19.702
Look, you know I gotta do this, right?

36:19.877 --> 36:20.901
I'm sorry, bro.

36:21.078 --> 36:23.774
No sorry. You've been getting on my
nerves for weeks and you know it.

36:23.948 --> 36:25.313
Guys, what's going on here?

36:25.483 --> 36:28.281
Listen, Dylan, the problem
has been mine, not yours.

36:28.452 --> 36:31.649
You can say that again. Since I bought
the Pit, you put me on a guilt trip.

36:31.822 --> 36:33.084
I can explain that, all right?

36:33.257 --> 36:35.725
Hey, I lent you my girlfriend,
you made a move on her.

36:35.893 --> 36:37.918
- You made a move on Kelly?
- Nothing happened.

36:38.095 --> 36:40.256
Then you send your little sex freak
over to my house

36:40.431 --> 36:41.693
trying to look for some handout.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.460
It was temporary insanity.
I wasn't thinking with my head.

36:44.635 --> 36:47.468
- You weren't thinking at all.
- Hold on a second.

36:48.105 --> 36:50.005
Let's back up to the part
about the sex freak.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.533
You obviously got some kind
of problem with me, don't you?

36:53.711 --> 36:55.235
Right now's your chance,
make your move.

36:55.413 --> 36:56.846
- Guys.
- I'm not gonna hit you, man.

36:57.014 --> 36:58.481
- Guys.
- You're like a brother to me.

36:58.649 --> 37:00.207
- You have to.
- No, I don't have to.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.944
But if you feel like you wanna hit me,
why don't you go ahead?

37:03.688 --> 37:05.315
All right.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.155
Do you know
how much this nose costs?

37:13.331 --> 37:15.322
God! You know,
I still have two good eyes left.

37:15.499 --> 37:17.433
Perhaps you'd each like
to gouge one of those out.

37:17.602 --> 37:19.467
Get off of me!

37:23.541 --> 37:24.599
This is my fault, guys.

37:24.775 --> 37:28.643
Hey, nothing's your fault
till I say it's your fault, all right?

37:28.813 --> 37:31.077
- It's your fault.
- Thanks.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.846
I was looking forward
to giving you a beating.

37:34.018 --> 37:37.215
I can obviously see now, the beating's
gonna come from Lucinda.

37:37.388 --> 37:39.253
You're telling me.

37:40.057 --> 37:42.548
Look at us.
She's got us at each other's throats.

37:42.727 --> 37:45.389
She's gotta be loving
every minute of this.

37:46.130 --> 37:47.859
Are you seeing Lucinda?

37:49.867 --> 37:51.596
I was.

37:52.169 --> 37:53.693
But no more, man.

37:54.405 --> 37:57.135
- That's over.
- Brandon?

37:57.308 --> 38:00.436
I've got brownies and ice cream
for you and your friends.

38:02.246 --> 38:03.440
Must be us.

38:07.251 --> 38:08.775
Hello, excuse me.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.550
Hello.

38:12.156 --> 38:13.783
- Steve!
- Steve!

38:13.958 --> 38:15.550
Hey, how you feeling there, big fella?

38:15.726 --> 38:17.557
Not loved.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.156
This is crazy.

38:22.333 --> 38:23.857
Keep your voice down.
They can hear you.

38:24.035 --> 38:27.004
I don't care. I don't want anything
to do with these people.

38:27.171 --> 38:28.195
They're terrorists.

38:28.372 --> 38:29.964
Janet, look,
if you'd please keep quiet...

38:30.141 --> 38:32.507
No, forget it. They're gonna discredit
the entire movement.

38:32.677 --> 38:36.408
And you're gonna let them.
I'm out of here.

38:41.385 --> 38:44.946
Look, I still think
we can reason with the trustees.

38:45.389 --> 38:47.949
They tabled the issue,
they didn't defeat it.

38:48.125 --> 38:51.185
Economic loss is the only thing
they understand, Allan.

38:51.362 --> 38:55.298
We went through the same runaround
with Burdick Industries in Seattle.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.195
I guess we have no choice.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.369
I knew she'd change her mind.

39:06.610 --> 39:09.602
- Brenda.
- Hi. Can I come in?

39:10.514 --> 39:12.175
This really isn't a good time.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.942
Look, Rocky died today.

39:15.553 --> 39:16.884
I'm sorry.

39:17.054 --> 39:18.954
I wanna know
what you're gonna do about it.

39:19.123 --> 39:20.852
Who knows how many more animals
are in there?

39:21.025 --> 39:22.959
How many are gonna die
unless we do something now?

39:23.127 --> 39:25.061
Well, actually,
that's what we've been discussing.

39:25.229 --> 39:27.561
Do you really think talk
is gonna do anything to stop it?

39:27.732 --> 39:29.723
No, but action will.

39:29.900 --> 39:32.061
Brenda, what are you doing here?

39:32.236 --> 39:33.726
Welcome.

39:34.405 --> 39:35.429
Oh, no.

39:35.606 --> 39:39.269
I think the fewer people
involved in this, the better, right?

39:39.443 --> 39:41.468
We have to build for the future.

39:41.645 --> 39:43.875
I look at Brenda
and I see myself ten years ago.

39:44.849 --> 39:46.043
Wait.

39:47.118 --> 39:49.313
Are you a member
of any law-enforcement agency?

39:50.321 --> 39:53.813
- Excuse me?
- FBI, L.A.P.D., ATF?

39:53.991 --> 39:57.017
If you are, you are required by law
to admit it now.

39:57.595 --> 39:59.153
- Of course not.
- Good.

39:59.630 --> 40:01.655
- Join us.
- No, wait.

40:01.832 --> 40:04.960
I don't think this is a good idea.
We don't know anything about this girl.

40:05.136 --> 40:07.627
You know, I am as committed
to this cause as anyone here.

40:07.805 --> 40:10.501
Jonathan, she's all right.

40:10.674 --> 40:12.266
We know nothing about her, Harvey.

40:12.443 --> 40:13.967
I say she's in.

40:15.179 --> 40:17.113
Okay, let's work out some strategy.

40:17.281 --> 40:19.943
Allan, you make sure
you got an alibi.

40:20.117 --> 40:23.086
You can't be anywhere near the labs
when it goes down.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.744
How can I not be a part of it?

40:24.922 --> 40:26.412
You'll be the obvious suspect.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.985
We need you free
to continue the work.

40:30.161 --> 40:32.220
And Brenda will be a perfect lookout.

40:32.396 --> 40:34.864
Just another student
roaming the halls.

40:36.567 --> 40:38.535
What do you say, Brenda?

40:39.570 --> 40:41.629
I'll do whatever it takes.

40:41.806 --> 40:43.171
Good.

40:47.812 --> 40:52.749
I can't believe that you and Brandon
would ever actually come to blows.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.714
And all because of me.

40:54.885 --> 40:56.648
Yeah, he's just lucky
Sanders was there.

40:56.821 --> 40:58.118
It would've gotten really nasty.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.519
Yeah, joke all you want.

41:00.691 --> 41:02.921
But I am flattered.

41:03.561 --> 41:06.792
I guess when it comes down to it,
I'm just an old-fashioned girl.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.625
Well, that's a good thing,

41:08.799 --> 41:10.960
because I am certainly
an old-fashioned guy.

41:11.135 --> 41:15.538
You know, possessive,
vindictive, yet tender.

41:15.706 --> 41:17.298
Tender?

41:27.284 --> 41:29.411
After tonight,
maybe they'll take us seriously.

41:29.587 --> 41:31.578
Okay, Brenda,
you'll be posted in the hall.

41:31.755 --> 41:34.121
If anybody shows up,
starts asking any questions,

41:34.291 --> 41:36.521
start talking loud enough
so we can hear.

41:36.694 --> 41:38.787
Remember, you're a student
working in one of the labs.

41:38.963 --> 41:41.488
You're just taking a break.
First time's always the hardest.

41:41.665 --> 41:43.326
I'll be fine.

41:46.504 --> 41:50.372
Here it is, Lab 33. Do your thing.

41:52.977 --> 41:54.239
Wait, what are you doing?

41:54.411 --> 41:56.538
Keep your voice down.

41:57.314 --> 41:59.145
You don't understand.
This lab isn't like that.

41:59.316 --> 42:00.340
Brenda, calm down.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.418
They are doing research
on infant death syndrome.

42:02.586 --> 42:05.282
- They're not hurting the animals.
- No, just enslaving them.

42:05.456 --> 42:06.855
You've got to go to the other labs.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.548
We will. This connects to the others.

42:08.726 --> 42:10.023
Wait, wait, wait.

42:10.194 --> 42:13.288
Wait in the hallway.
They know what they're doing.

42:46.797 --> 42:49.288
- FBI. Now get your hands up.
- What's going on?

42:49.466 --> 42:50.899
You have the right to remain silent.

42:51.068 --> 42:52.729
If you give up that right
to remain silent,

42:52.903 --> 42:55.269
anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

42:55.439 --> 42:56.736
You have the right to an attorney

42:56.907 --> 42:58.841
and have that attorney present
during questioning.

42:59.009 --> 43:00.499
If you so desire
and cannot afford one,

43:00.678 --> 43:03.806
one will be appointed to you
without cost by the court.

43:03.981 --> 43:06.677
Do you understand each of these
rights as I've explained them to you?

43:06.850 --> 43:09.341
Do you wish to give up
the right to remain silent?

43:09.520 --> 43:11.750
Do you wish to give up your right
to speak to an attorney

43:11.922 --> 43:13.913
and have him present
during questioning?

43:20.564 --> 43:21.622
Hi, I'm Tori Spelling,

43:21.799 --> 43:24.267
and this is one of my favorite co-stars,
Pound Cake.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.164
And as you can see,
we're both alive and well

43:26.337 --> 43:28.328
and happy you watched
our 100th episode tonight.

43:28.505 --> 43:30.996
<i>And on behalf of everyone involved
with the making of 90210,</i>

43:31.175 --> 43:32.802
I would just like to say thank you.

43:32.977 --> 43:34.467
And Rocky would like to say:
