29:08.094 --> 29:09.704
of the adjusted policy.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.533
Mrs. Hupp, why did Betsy
make you the beneficiary

29:12.576 --> 29:14.013
on the policy
instead of somebody

29:14.056 --> 29:15.188
in her own family?

29:15.231 --> 29:16.493
- Betsy wanted to make sure

29:16.537 --> 29:18.495
her daughters got the money,

29:18.539 --> 29:21.803
and she couldn't trust Russ
to do that.

29:21.847 --> 29:24.240
- Why did you tell
the insurance company

29:24.284 --> 29:27.722
to give Betsy's daughters
no money because

29:27.766 --> 29:29.115
"Lily was on drugs

29:29.158 --> 29:31.987
and Mariah had blown
money away before"?

29:32.031 --> 29:33.946
- Say that again?

29:33.989 --> 29:36.557
- You said
that Lily was on drugs

29:36.600 --> 29:38.864
and Mariah had blown
money away before.

29:38.907 --> 29:40.996

No, no, no, no.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.041
Not how I worded it.

29:42.084 --> 29:43.869

29:43.912 --> 29:45.087

hears these answers.

from his own kitchen,

This was personal.

But then get got careless.

when he stepped in her blood.

by these slippers.

on the bottom

37:10.010 --> 37:12.273

on the defendant.

any blood on his clothes?

37:27.680 --> 37:30.335

And folks, I am gonna tell you
that I don't think

37:33.512 --> 37:38.125

or even looked like one.

four people testify

37:40.519 --> 37:43.173

at the time of the murder.

37:43.217 --> 37:45.045
Now that--that's proof.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.829
- Sure.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.223
Russ went home to Troy.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.747
But then I submit to you

37:51.791 --> 37:55.273
that Sean Walker went
to the Arby's, not Russ.

37:55.316 --> 37:57.144
Walker got the receipts.

37:57.187 --> 37:59.712
He drove to Russell's in Troy.

37:59.755 --> 38:01.322
They exchanged phones.

38:01.366 --> 38:02.758
They all text.

38:02.802 --> 38:04.064
They coordinate,

38:04.107 --> 38:07.197

the defendant's alibi

38:07.241 --> 38:08.808
is sealed.
- Your Honor,

of being complicit to a murder

38:12.072 --> 38:13.203
