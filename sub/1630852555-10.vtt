WEBVTT

00:01.784 --> 00:03.046
Last time onNaomi...

00:03.090 --> 00:04.395
They were hunting you.

00:04.439 --> 00:05.353
They work for a man
named Brutus.

00:05.396 --> 00:06.789
He resented the 29.

00:06.832 --> 00:09.096
All of us are on the run
because of you.

00:09.139 --> 00:12.316
Your powers are acting
like a magnet.
Brutus will send others.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.884
You really think
there is an alien here
at this party?

00:14.927 --> 00:17.408
You never do know people
as well as you think.

00:17.452 --> 00:18.888
You were breaking
into my locker.

00:18.931 --> 00:20.281
Is the disk in there?

00:20.324 --> 00:21.195
And you
think I stole it?

00:21.238 --> 00:22.892
Is this what this is all about?

00:22.935 --> 00:24.937
Aliens are a danger
to our way of life.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.765
I know who you are.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.637
Sometimes the people
you think you know the best

00:28.680 --> 00:30.726
are the ones you don't
really know at all.

00:58.232 --> 01:01.539
Naomi, please.
Please let us explain.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.280
Pumpkin, just talk to us.

01:03.324 --> 01:04.151
I can't.

01:37.314 --> 01:39.447
Your parents are aliens?

01:40.187 --> 01:42.232
I know.

01:42.276 --> 01:44.669
Is this what it feels like
to go through
an existential crisis?

01:44.713 --> 01:47.194
I thought I wouldn't
have one till my 20s.

01:47.237 --> 01:50.110
I just can't believe
they've been lying to me
this whole time.

01:54.549 --> 01:57.421
Did they try
to explain themselves?

01:58.335 --> 01:59.815
They wanted to talk, but...

02:01.338 --> 02:02.470
I can't even look at them.

02:03.253 --> 02:05.386
My entire life is a lie.

02:05.429 --> 02:07.301
We don't know that for sure.

02:07.344 --> 02:11.218
Yes, this is some Succession
level type family dysfunction.

02:11.261 --> 02:13.307
But they're still your parents.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.396
I don't know who they are.

02:15.439 --> 02:16.788
Is my mom even a linguist?

02:16.832 --> 02:19.400
Is my dad actually
in the military?

02:19.443 --> 02:21.793
I'm pretty sure
you can't fake
being in the army.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.143
Linguistics?

02:23.186 --> 02:24.666
Maybe.

02:24.709 --> 02:28.148
Every time my mom cried
when I asked about my adoption,

02:29.279 --> 02:30.541
I felt horrible.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.329
But I guess it was just
all an act.

02:35.372 --> 02:37.679
I know that this doesn't
make it any better...

02:39.333 --> 02:40.551
but your parents love you.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.423
You can't fake
love like that.

02:42.466 --> 02:44.381
Annabelle,
please don't tell me
I should talk to them.

02:44.425 --> 02:46.992
Hell, no.
I'm furious with them.

02:47.036 --> 02:48.559
They could have
told me the truth.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.214
When I found out
I had powers,

02:51.258 --> 02:53.129
they could have made it
easier for me.

02:54.348 --> 02:56.350
Instead,
they let me feel alone.

03:05.141 --> 03:06.664
I'm so sorry, babe.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.015
Thank you
for letting me crash here.

03:10.451 --> 03:11.626
Of course.

03:13.497 --> 03:15.195
You're going to be okay, babe.

03:15.238 --> 03:16.152
You know that...

03:17.022 --> 03:17.936
right?

03:20.025 --> 03:23.551
All I know is
I spent my entire life

03:23.594 --> 03:25.509
believing what everyone
told me about myself.

03:27.468 --> 03:29.339
It's time I find my own truth.

03:31.646 --> 03:32.777
How are you feeling?

03:33.474 --> 03:34.301
Angry.

03:35.737 --> 03:37.869
Confused, really sad.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.393
I thought your wings
could sense people

03:39.436 --> 03:41.351
who weren't from this earth.

03:41.395 --> 03:42.570
Only if they have powers.

03:42.613 --> 03:45.225
So, that means what?

03:45.268 --> 03:46.704
My parents are normal?

03:46.748 --> 03:48.271
When it comes
to the multi-verse,

03:48.315 --> 03:50.447
normal is relative.

03:50.491 --> 03:51.448
Why would their eyes
glow blue

03:51.492 --> 03:53.058
if they didn't have powers?

03:53.102 --> 03:54.582
There are differences
on the molecular level.

03:55.583 --> 03:56.671
They're not human.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.413
Right.

03:59.456 --> 04:02.242
Because my parents
are actual aliens.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.377
Who are they?

04:07.421 --> 04:09.379
How did they adopt me?

04:09.423 --> 04:10.641
Where are they really from?

04:10.685 --> 04:11.816
They're from Earth-29.

04:16.734 --> 04:18.606
I met them on our home planet.

04:19.563 --> 04:20.869
You lied to me?

04:20.912 --> 04:22.218
I thought I could trust you.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.350
I thought you were on my team!

04:23.393 --> 04:24.525
I am, Naomi.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.309
And so are your parents.

04:29.094 --> 04:30.574
I didn't know Greg
and Jennifer well,

04:30.618 --> 04:32.315
but I knew them
to be good.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.665
So when I arrived
on Earth and I saw that
you were with them,

04:34.709 --> 04:36.145
I knew you'd be safe.

04:37.407 --> 04:38.495
Loved.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.546
You should've told me.

04:45.589 --> 04:48.592
I wanted you to have
a normal life
for as long as you could.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.595
But maybe I miscalculated.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.336
Is that your idea
of an apology?

04:55.512 --> 04:57.122
How did I get to this Earth,

04:57.166 --> 04:58.863
really?

04:58.907 --> 05:01.213
There are only two people
who know the answer
to that question.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.608
I'm not talking
to my parents.

05:08.438 --> 05:10.788
Dee...

05:10.832 --> 05:14.226
when you came over for dinner,
you asked about this light.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.533
You said that it might
be above my birth rock.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.535
An energy source.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.494
Usually present
at arrival events.

05:20.537 --> 05:23.540
Your parents claimed
they did not see one.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.847
Except now
they're officially unreliable.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.415
Why would they lie about that?

05:28.458 --> 05:29.590
Why would they lie
about any of it?

05:51.916 --> 05:54.049
There's no need
for that, Akira.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.007
Mac.

05:56.051 --> 05:58.183
It's not exactly
a warm welcome.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.315
It wasn't meant to be.

06:03.232 --> 06:07.584
No offense, but this place
is seriously lacking in...

06:08.672 --> 06:10.195
everything.

06:10.239 --> 06:12.459
But then again,
so is this planet.

06:13.547 --> 06:14.765
Makes our world
look like paradise.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.637
What do you want, Mac?

06:16.680 --> 06:19.335
Brutus sends his regards.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.599
And he'd like to request
your help on a new project,

06:22.643 --> 06:23.557
respectfully.

06:24.471 --> 06:25.646
I'm not interested.

06:25.689 --> 06:27.387
Well, you haven't even
heard his offer.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.261
We found the girl, Akira.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.610
She's on this earth.

06:33.654 --> 06:35.569
Her powers have started
to manifest.

06:35.612 --> 06:36.874
I have no interest in her.

06:38.485 --> 06:39.529
Maybe not.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.052
But Brutus does.

06:41.096 --> 06:42.880
You're going
to help us defeat her.

06:47.624 --> 06:50.061
Tell Brutus
that I decline.

06:50.105 --> 06:51.019
Respectfully.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.022
It's not really a request.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.067
But I think you know that.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.288
Besides, you've worked
with him once.

06:59.767 --> 07:00.724
Why not again?

07:00.768 --> 07:03.379
I didn't work with Brutus.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.511
We had an agreement.

07:04.554 --> 07:05.773
I turned Zumbado
over to Brutus

07:05.816 --> 07:08.123
and he agreed to let
the rest of us leave.

07:09.516 --> 07:10.778
That deal is over now.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.737
Is anything
ever really over?

07:14.738 --> 07:15.913
Think about it.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.526
War is coming, Akira.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.268
I suggest you choose
the winning side.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.711
If I would've known
finding your truth

07:30.754 --> 07:32.669
was going to involve
a possible snake encounter,

07:32.713 --> 07:34.628
I might not have
been so supportive.

07:34.671 --> 07:36.456
We're almost there.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.762
Last time I was here,
my parents told me
they found me on a rock.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.113
I hated that they
didn't tell me the truth,

07:42.157 --> 07:44.768
but I loved them
for adopting me.

07:44.812 --> 07:47.815
I thought they were
like Ma and Pa Kent.

07:47.858 --> 07:50.382
I should have known
that wasn't the only thing
they were lying about.

07:56.563 --> 07:57.738
Here we are.

08:03.657 --> 08:06.224
This is your space rock?

08:06.268 --> 08:07.791
Kind of thought
it would look more...

08:09.140 --> 08:10.054
Space-y?

08:13.275 --> 08:14.232
Kind of like that.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.105
What else does it do?

08:17.148 --> 08:18.280
I don't know.

08:18.323 --> 08:19.977
I just know
that it's connected to me.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.544
I think I missed something
last time.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.643
There's something in there.
Stand back.

08:54.708 --> 08:55.883
So...

08:56.623 --> 08:57.798
What is that thing?

08:59.321 --> 09:00.235
I have no idea.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.550
This is going to be
a long two days.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.116
I can't believe
my parents went out of town,

09:12.160 --> 09:14.771
and left me in charge
of a tiny human.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.338
Naomi, are you listening?

09:19.994 --> 09:21.648
Babe, if you stare
at that phone any longer,

09:21.691 --> 09:22.605
it's going to melt.

09:25.521 --> 09:26.566
Still nothing from Nathan?

09:28.045 --> 09:29.394
No.

09:29.438 --> 09:31.745
I tried texting him,
calling him.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.224
I just tried calling him
on a landline,

09:33.268 --> 09:35.313
which apparently is attached
to the wall in the house.

09:35.357 --> 09:37.968
I thought those
only existed in old movies,
like, from the '90s.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.666
Listen, I get why he's mad.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.363
I was wrong to accuse him.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.627
But he's fully ghosting me.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.063
He'll come around.

09:47.021 --> 09:49.414
Annabelle, what is this?

09:50.546 --> 09:52.417
Your lunch.

09:52.461 --> 09:55.812
It's supposed to be
cream cheese, lettuce,
pickles, banana slices,

09:55.856 --> 09:59.424
grape jelly on the side
with no crusts.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.818
If I sent you to school
with that atrocity,

10:01.862 --> 10:04.778
I'd get arrested
for child abuse.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.693
That is a nice turkey Swiss
with mayo.

10:06.736 --> 10:08.520
Mayo is disgusting.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.784
Mayo is disgusting?

10:10.827 --> 10:12.786
Naomi?

10:12.829 --> 10:15.049
I think it's just ahead
of its time.

10:15.092 --> 10:17.573
Don't encourage her.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.402
Finish getting ready
before I swap out
your chips for kale.

10:22.578 --> 10:27.670
Sorry, I think we were
talking about a certain
ghosting soccer player.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.541
Shouldn't even be thinking
about Nathan.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.762
I need to figure out
what this is.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.808
How are you going to do that?

10:34.851 --> 10:39.943
I'm assuming that
"Alien mystery cube"
isn't a top Google search.

10:39.987 --> 10:42.467
I need to talk to someone
who isn't from this earth.

10:42.511 --> 10:45.470
Dee told me about this place
that Adam Blake took him to.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.821
A bar where people
like me hang out.

10:47.864 --> 10:52.564
Why not talk to Dee or Zumbado
or one of the other many aliens
that we know.

10:52.608 --> 10:55.655
Because I'm tired
of just believing
what everyone else tells me.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.746
Okay, well,
how are you going to get there?

10:59.789 --> 11:02.749
I recall the family
credit card being
referred to as blood money.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.272
I have a plan for that.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.928
I'll see you
when I get back tonight.

11:07.971 --> 11:09.581
You mean you'll see me
at school.

11:10.017 --> 11:11.192
I'm not going.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.978
Wait, you're serious?

11:15.022 --> 11:16.719
You're skipping school?
You've never skipped school.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.503
You've never even
taken a sick day.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.115
There's a first time
for everything.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.699
I always thought used cars
was a strange choice for you.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.096
What can I do for you, Greg?

11:46.140 --> 11:48.316
Naomi found out
who we really are.

11:50.840 --> 11:51.754
Was that a question?

11:52.842 --> 11:54.844
I didn't tell her.

11:54.888 --> 11:55.845
You set her down the path.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.760
You come here blaming me,

11:57.804 --> 12:00.589
but you and Jennifer
had 16 years
to tell Naomi the truth.

12:00.632 --> 12:02.809
And you told her everything
there is to know about you?

12:02.852 --> 12:04.506
I didn't lie to her.

12:09.990 --> 12:10.947
I'm not here to argue.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.211
We have bigger problems.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.736
Naomi's still in danger
from the military.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.781
I thought that you
took care of Steel.

12:18.825 --> 12:21.479
That doesn't mean the military
is going to stand down.

12:21.523 --> 12:23.177
The task force
is still active.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.701
It's only a matter of time
before they replace Steel.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.268
We have to get ahead of this.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.359
You're asking for my help.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.101
I'm asking for my daughter.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.581
Keeping Naomi safe
is all that matters.

12:38.192 --> 12:39.497
Even if she hates me.

12:45.112 --> 12:46.287
What do we need to do?

12:47.854 --> 12:49.638
Damage control.

12:49.681 --> 12:53.990
I found out R&D
developed a prototype
that tracks alien energy.

12:54.034 --> 12:55.992
That's how Steel found Naomi.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.428
There was an incident
at STAR Labs,

12:57.472 --> 12:59.126
and it gave them
the final piece.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.695
You don't seem surprised.

13:03.739 --> 13:07.743
The incident that occurred
at Star Labs was a result
of Naomi's powers.

13:10.833 --> 13:11.747
She didn't tell you?

13:14.968 --> 13:15.882
No.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.277
That means her energy
is all over that site.

13:20.321 --> 13:21.670
We'll have to erase it.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.022
How do you propose we do that?

13:28.024 --> 13:30.810
You are still one of the 29,

13:32.550 --> 13:33.508
aren't you?

13:34.988 --> 13:36.119
Thank you for the ride.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.121
Are you kidding?

13:38.165 --> 13:41.168
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for you
to embrace your inner rebel?

13:43.083 --> 13:45.999
If only our rebel soundtrack
was a little bit more exciting.

13:46.042 --> 13:49.524
We won't be defeated
by AM radio, okay?

13:54.137 --> 13:56.444
No way. I haven't heard
this song in so long.

13:56.487 --> 13:59.012
It's a road trip miracle.
You need to show me your moves.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.883
Oh, you mean like this?

14:01.710 --> 14:02.624
Oh!

14:05.148 --> 14:07.498
Amateur.

14:14.070 --> 14:17.857
-Look.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.692
Okay.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.216
Twenty bucks
and I'll teach you

14:29.259 --> 14:31.392
how to turn off
Netflix's parental controls.

14:31.435 --> 14:34.047
My silence is worth
at least $50.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.700
Fifty buck? You're ten.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.659
What could you
possibly need to buy?

14:37.702 --> 14:41.054
BTS is coming to Portland
and I'm not about
that mezzanine life.

14:41.097 --> 14:42.316
Annabelle?

14:42.359 --> 14:45.449
Mrs. M. You're home.

14:46.276 --> 14:47.843
In the middle of the day.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.150
I left work early.
I... I couldn't concentrate.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.892
-Hi, Sophie.
-Hi, Mrs. McDuffie.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.937
I think I'm supposed to be
mad at you.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.071
Uh, what are you girls
doing here?

14:58.114 --> 14:59.724
Not breaking in.

14:59.768 --> 15:02.858
Naomi just wanted us
to grab a couple of things.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.556
Clothes, electric toothbrush.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.297
You know how much she cares
about dental hygiene.

15:08.124 --> 15:09.082
Right.

15:11.954 --> 15:12.868
How is she?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.045
Mrs. M.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.525
You know
I'm your number one fan,

15:17.568 --> 15:20.702
but this is kind of
a best friend solidarity issue.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.966
Even though
it physically pains me
to have to draw this boundary.

15:24.010 --> 15:27.665
I understand.
It's just that we're both
so worried about her.

15:28.101 --> 15:29.276
Is she okay?

15:30.059 --> 15:31.321
Is she angry?

15:32.105 --> 15:34.324
Anger's a relative term.

15:34.368 --> 15:37.023
She never wants
to see you again.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.199
Not helping.
Headphones, please.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.375
Fine. 50 bucks.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.902
You can't blame her
for being mad at you.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.513
I don't. She has every right.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.037
I just wish
she'd let us explain.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.821
She just needs time.

15:52.864 --> 15:53.778
We made a mistake.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.345
We know that.

15:55.389 --> 15:57.043
Maybe you could talk to her.

15:57.086 --> 15:59.088
She'll listen to you.

15:59.132 --> 16:01.177
I really don't want to get
in the middle of this.

16:01.221 --> 16:04.354
Annabelle, please.
You've always been like
a second daughter to us.

16:04.398 --> 16:08.097
Just please tell her
that we are so sorry.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.143
And that we love her
more than anything.

16:10.186 --> 16:13.581
And we will do whatever
it takes to make it right.

16:13.624 --> 16:16.323
I'm sorry, Mrs. M,
but we we have to go.

16:16.366 --> 16:19.152
Sophie. I'm sorry.
We just, we just have to go.

16:20.631 --> 16:21.545
Bye.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.594
Are you sure
you don't want me
to come inside with you?

16:28.857 --> 16:29.989
It's kind of personal.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.428
I won't be long though,
I promise.

16:35.907 --> 16:39.041
Fine, but if you're not back
in ten minutes,

16:39.085 --> 16:40.129
I'm coming to your rescue.

16:40.825 --> 16:41.783
Okay.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.153
I need to get inside.

17:04.197 --> 17:05.633
We don't serve Shirley Temples.

17:05.676 --> 17:08.114
I'm looking for information.

17:08.157 --> 17:10.116
What kind of information?

17:10.159 --> 17:13.380
I have an artifact,
and I need someone
to look at it.

17:13.423 --> 17:14.729
You have to be more specific.

17:24.391 --> 17:25.827
Where did you get that?

17:25.870 --> 17:26.741
I found it.

17:27.655 --> 17:28.917
What's that you got there?

17:29.352 --> 17:32.007
Um, it's nothing.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.009
It's not nothing.
I just want
to take a look at it.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.359
Please let go of my hand.
I need to go.

17:39.884 --> 17:41.016
Akira?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.061
We need to go.

17:42.670 --> 17:43.584
Now.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.509
I'll do some work
in the back.

18:01.384 --> 18:02.385
The people
of this planet

18:02.429 --> 18:04.387
cannot get
enough of our stories.

18:04.431 --> 18:07.129
In print,
they worship us as heroes.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.652
But, think of the consequences

18:08.696 --> 18:10.480
were we ever to reveal
our powers.

18:12.352 --> 18:15.094
Humanity is a constant paradox.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.835
I found this
at the place where I landed.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.275
Do you know what this is?

18:23.450 --> 18:25.452
I warned you to stay away.

18:25.495 --> 18:28.890
The people I love the most
have been lying to me.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.805
My parents
have been lying to me.

18:33.155 --> 18:34.417
They're from Earth-29.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.117
So they finally told you.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.686
You knew my parents too?

18:42.730 --> 18:44.514
Not well.

18:44.558 --> 18:47.126
My interactions with Greg
and Jennifer were brief.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.568
I don't really know you,

18:54.611 --> 18:59.399
but lately it feels
like everyone in my life
is not actually for me.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.879
I'm supposed to have
this big destiny,

19:01.923 --> 19:04.969
but everyone
keeps treating me
like I'm a child.

19:06.362 --> 19:07.450
I deserve the truth.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.326
Some truths are very painful.

19:13.369 --> 19:14.240
I already know that.

19:18.244 --> 19:22.204
This is a trans-matter cube.

19:22.248 --> 19:26.077
It is what allows for travel
between worlds and dimensions.

19:29.342 --> 19:31.387
How do you know that?

19:31.431 --> 19:32.649
Because I'm the one
who made it.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.581
Naomi's energy signature.

19:51.625 --> 19:54.149
It's like a fingerprint.
We need to erase it.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.342
Naomi did all this?

20:20.958 --> 20:22.133
It's done.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.918
I've erased all traces
of Naomi's energy.

20:29.315 --> 20:32.231
Naomi's never expressed
powers on this scale.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.450
You really have no idea.

20:35.408 --> 20:36.800
You know about her powers.

20:38.889 --> 20:42.066
About all this
and you didn't say anything?

20:42.110 --> 20:43.242
You should have told us.

20:43.285 --> 20:46.157
So you could put
another gun in my face?

20:46.201 --> 20:48.812
You made it clear
that you didn't want to hear
anything that I had to say.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.597
Is that why you told us
to leave town?

20:50.640 --> 20:52.207
No, she was in danger

20:52.251 --> 20:55.341
the second that her powers
started to manifest.

20:55.384 --> 20:58.082
What's happened here
is just a glimpse
into her potential.

20:59.519 --> 21:00.650
She can save our planet.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.261
How many times
do we have to tell you?

21:02.304 --> 21:03.827
We don't want that for Naomi.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.742
She can still have
a normal life.

21:05.786 --> 21:07.353
You can't honestly
believe that.

21:07.396 --> 21:11.313
You've always wanted me
and Jennifer out
of the picture.

21:11.357 --> 21:15.361
So you could use Naomi
for your own deluded purposes
against Brutus.

21:15.404 --> 21:19.713
Reuniting the 29 and saving
our planet from Brutus
is not deluded.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.239
She is the only one
that can defeat him, Greg.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.545
It's her destiny.

21:25.588 --> 21:28.461
It's the destiny you want
for her, not us.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.332
We're the ones that love her.

21:30.376 --> 21:31.855
You're not the only ones.

21:35.772 --> 21:39.123
The only way to protect
Naomi from Brutus

21:39.167 --> 21:40.168
is to keep her hidden.

21:41.387 --> 21:44.433
Her "destiny" will destroy her.

21:44.477 --> 21:47.306
You asked me
not to tell Naomi the truth

21:47.349 --> 21:49.003
and I respected that.

21:49.046 --> 21:51.135
But keeping it from her,
lying to her

21:51.179 --> 21:52.920
has only put her in
greater danger.

21:54.704 --> 21:56.271
I accept my role in that.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.666
But it's time you and Jennifer
do the same.

22:01.798 --> 22:02.973
Before it's too late.

22:17.292 --> 22:18.206
Annabelle?

22:19.120 --> 22:20.251
And child.

22:20.295 --> 22:22.689
You're friends
with the tattoo shop guy?

22:22.732 --> 22:24.865
You just got 200% cooler.

22:24.908 --> 22:28.521
Not that I need your stamp
of approval, but yes.

22:28.564 --> 22:30.523
Dee and I go way back.

22:30.566 --> 22:32.307
This is my little sister,
Sophie.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.439
Nice to meet you, Sophie.

22:36.703 --> 22:38.487
This isn't really
a place for children.

22:38.531 --> 22:40.968
Ten is the new 16.
You won't even know
she's here.

22:49.672 --> 22:50.760
I need your help.

22:54.547 --> 22:55.765
Is someone in danger?

22:55.809 --> 22:56.766
Yes, me.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.725
Of being
a terrible best friend.

22:58.768 --> 23:01.423
I told Naomi that I would get
some things from her house
and I failed.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.512
And that is a problem why?

23:03.556 --> 23:05.427
Because Naomi's going
through a lot right now

23:05.471 --> 23:08.082
and I told her that
I would do this
one thing for her.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.302
I'm not sure how I can help.

23:11.346 --> 23:14.088
Do they not have
best friends on
your planet?

23:16.656 --> 23:19.441
I just need you
to go to her house
and get her things for me.

23:19.485 --> 23:23.967
Why don't you just go back
and try again?

23:24.011 --> 23:25.969
Because Mrs. M,
she started crying.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.494
I love the McDuffies,

23:28.537 --> 23:31.018
they're like a second family
to me.

23:31.061 --> 23:32.802
You can't fix this for her.

23:34.238 --> 23:36.676
I don't know how else
I can help her.

23:36.719 --> 23:37.981
You are helping her

23:39.374 --> 23:40.288
by being there,

23:41.507 --> 23:42.421
like you always are.

23:44.335 --> 23:45.249
You're very wise.

23:45.859 --> 23:46.773
Hm.

23:46.816 --> 23:48.905
He really is.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.609
What's transmatter?

23:56.652 --> 23:59.089
It kind of sounds made up.

23:59.133 --> 24:03.050
The short answer
is that it has to do
with theoretical physics.

24:03.093 --> 24:06.488
This cube is very valuable,
very rare.

24:06.532 --> 24:09.317
That's why everyone reacted
the way they did.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.710
Why was it inside a rock?

24:11.841 --> 24:13.626
I hid it there,

24:13.669 --> 24:15.323
in case you ever
wanted to go back.

24:16.977 --> 24:17.934
Back?

24:18.805 --> 24:20.067
To our home planet?

24:21.590 --> 24:23.113
Why would I need
to go back?

24:24.550 --> 24:26.465
I hope it doesn't
come to that.

24:28.902 --> 24:31.121
I created the transmatter cube

24:31.165 --> 24:34.647
so that the 29
could escape our planet.

24:34.690 --> 24:38.128
This cube, when used properly,
opens a portal.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.088
A portal?

24:41.131 --> 24:43.482
I always thought I got to Earth
in a spaceship.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.745
Well, you don't need
a spaceship if you
have one of these.

24:45.788 --> 24:49.705
So does this mean I can
use this to go back

24:49.749 --> 24:51.011
to Earth-29?

24:52.055 --> 24:53.274
You do not want
to do that.

24:53.317 --> 24:55.015
-Trust me.

24:58.192 --> 24:59.628
Excuse me,

24:59.672 --> 25:01.804
I'm looking for
a birthday gift
for my nephew.

25:06.679 --> 25:07.941
Principal Brooks?

25:09.333 --> 25:10.726
Miss McDuffie.

25:10.770 --> 25:13.076
Aren't you supposed to be
in fifth period right now?

25:17.733 --> 25:18.865
Thank you.

25:21.345 --> 25:22.477
Slow down, pumpkin.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.826
I really don't want
to talk right now.

25:23.870 --> 25:26.220
Naomi, we haven't
seen you in days.

25:26.263 --> 25:27.656
We want to know
if you're okay.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.571
You can't ignore us
forever.

25:29.615 --> 25:33.183
We love you, baby, please
give us a chance to apologize,
to explain.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.188
You don't think I want that?

25:38.232 --> 25:40.930
To hear you say something
that'll just explain
all of this away.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.325
Were you ever
going to tell me?

25:44.847 --> 25:45.761
Yes.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.373
We just didn't know how.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.160
I've always told you
everything.

25:54.509 --> 25:55.554
I know we hurt you.

25:56.511 --> 25:58.687
But this has to stop.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.950
Are you seriously trying
to parent me right now?

26:00.994 --> 26:04.345
Yes, because we're
your parents,
no matter what.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.477
Skipping school?

26:06.521 --> 26:07.653
That's not like you.

26:10.220 --> 26:12.353
It's time for you to come home.

26:12.396 --> 26:13.702
No more Annabelle's.

26:13.746 --> 26:15.138
That's not going to happen.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.749
You can be mad all you want,

26:17.793 --> 26:19.360
but you're a 16-year-old girl.

26:19.403 --> 26:21.754
You're our daughter
and you're coming home.

26:21.797 --> 26:24.017
Good luck trying to
enforce that.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.714
Unless you're hiding
your powers, too.

26:28.325 --> 26:29.022
Naomi!

26:34.375 --> 26:36.725
Your rhythm is off.
Watch your footwork.

26:50.783 --> 26:52.132
You're unfocused tonight.

26:52.175 --> 26:54.569
I'm fine.
Let's go again.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.746
It's late, much later
than our usual training time.

26:57.790 --> 27:00.836
Your parents must be
expecting you home.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.533
I don't care what they expect.

27:06.146 --> 27:08.844
Dee, no, please,
I need to go again.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.106
Your mind is elsewhere.

27:25.861 --> 27:27.036
Have you talked
to your parents?

27:28.124 --> 27:29.604
Earlier at school,
but we didn't...

27:30.823 --> 27:32.259
exactly talk, talk.

27:34.783 --> 27:35.697
I'm sorry, Naomi.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.920
I know this is
incredibly painful.

27:43.226 --> 27:45.272
Most kids fight with
their parents.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.709
I never did.

27:47.753 --> 27:51.800
My entire life my parents
have been my one constant.

27:54.107 --> 27:55.717
The thing I could
always count on.

27:58.459 --> 28:01.897
Our relationship
means everything to me.

28:01.941 --> 28:04.073
Who am I without that,
without them?

28:04.770 --> 28:05.901
Hey.

28:08.382 --> 28:09.731
You're still you.

28:10.993 --> 28:12.865
Nothing will change that.

28:13.604 --> 28:15.563
That's not true.

28:15.606 --> 28:17.696
I don't even feel like
myself anymore.

28:18.871 --> 28:20.742
I've watched you grow.

28:20.786 --> 28:25.529
You're stronger and more
resilient than you were
even a few months ago.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.838
No matter what happens
with your parents,

28:29.882 --> 28:33.712
you're more than capable
of standing on your own
two feet.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.453
Don't ever forget that.

28:48.596 --> 28:49.510
Used cars?

28:51.251 --> 28:53.993
It's not much of
an upgrade from
the factory, is it?

28:56.865 --> 28:57.997
You dress differently here.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.087
Let's not do this tonight.

29:02.305 --> 29:04.351
I liked the way
you dressed before.

29:04.394 --> 29:06.179
What do
you want, Akira?

29:06.222 --> 29:09.791
I had a conversation
with Naomi.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.532
She found the transmatter cube.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.189
Why are you even
talking to her?

29:16.232 --> 29:18.800
She was flashing it
at an outpost

29:18.844 --> 29:20.802
that was full of
beings like us.

29:20.846 --> 29:24.153
Is this girl really the one
you have your hopes
pinned on?

29:26.242 --> 29:27.156
She needs more time.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.375
She doesn't have it.

29:30.116 --> 29:31.247
Then why are you here?

29:32.988 --> 29:33.902
Mac is here.

29:35.077 --> 29:36.600
-In Port Oswego?
-Not yet.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.820
But you know she has
the technology
to find Naomi.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.604
It's just a matter of time.

29:40.648 --> 29:41.562
And how do you know this?

29:46.219 --> 29:47.742
Mac wants you to help Brutus.

29:49.352 --> 29:51.615
Same way you did last time
when you sold me out.

29:51.659 --> 29:54.314
You brought that on yourself
when you betrayed us.

29:57.578 --> 29:59.188
It doesn't matter
what I say.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.148
You'll always believe
the worst in me.

30:02.191 --> 30:04.150
You still believe
the worst in me.

30:05.194 --> 30:06.979
Yes, Mac came to see me.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.545
No, I am not helping her.

30:08.589 --> 30:10.330
Or Brutus.

30:10.373 --> 30:11.984
You really expect me
to believe that you're
here to help Naomi?

30:12.027 --> 30:13.072
It's the truth.

30:13.115 --> 30:15.030
I came here to warn you.

30:15.074 --> 30:17.467
I don't believe you.

30:17.511 --> 30:19.034
Well, you're just gonna
have to trust me.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.138
Naomi.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.230
-You made it.
-Didn't you hear?
I'm a rebel now.

31:24.273 --> 31:26.319
Oh, yeah, girl.

31:26.362 --> 31:27.711
Whose party is this?

31:27.755 --> 31:30.889
Uh, no idea. They just,
kind of, happen.

31:30.932 --> 31:33.892
Uh, how long does it run till?

31:33.935 --> 31:36.111
Until the sun comes up
or the cops show up.

31:36.155 --> 31:37.460
Come on, let's dance.

31:55.130 --> 31:56.827
Annabelle, you came!

31:58.046 --> 31:59.874
This is the party?

31:59.918 --> 32:01.745
Isn't it the best?

32:01.789 --> 32:04.357
Feels like loud music
in an old warehouse
with sweaty teenagers.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.272
You're going to love it.
Trust me.

32:06.315 --> 32:08.839
I hope so. I had to use
all my birthday money
to pay for a babysitter.

32:08.883 --> 32:10.102
Come on.

32:10.145 --> 32:11.842
-Annabelle! Hey!
-Hey.

32:25.639 --> 32:28.511
I was so wrong.
This is so fun!

32:34.300 --> 32:35.910
I love this song.

33:26.308 --> 33:27.570
Uh...

33:30.182 --> 33:31.357
What?

33:32.532 --> 33:33.446
Uh...

33:34.490 --> 33:35.317
Hm.

33:36.840 --> 33:37.711
Sorry, we...

33:39.104 --> 33:41.454
We were just
vibing all night.

33:41.497 --> 33:43.195
I have a boyfriend.

33:43.238 --> 33:44.457
Okay, so where is he?

33:45.501 --> 33:46.981
Lourdes, that doesn't matter.

33:47.808 --> 33:48.722
So...

33:49.592 --> 33:51.159
What has all this been about?

33:51.203 --> 33:52.943
Were you just using me
for a ride and to hang out

33:52.987 --> 33:54.249
-with that weird lady
at the comic shop?
-No...

33:55.381 --> 33:57.165
It's not like that.

33:57.209 --> 33:59.341
We're friends.
I thought we were
having a fun time.

34:00.821 --> 34:03.041
I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

34:04.912 --> 34:08.176
I don't just want to be
your ride or your friend,
and you know that.

34:08.220 --> 34:09.699
And you know
I'm with Nathan.

34:10.874 --> 34:14.139
If you want to deny
how you feel, fine,

34:14.182 --> 34:16.097
but I know what I want.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.578
And I'm not settling
for being the girl
you use in selfies

34:18.621 --> 34:20.493
to make your
boyfriend jealous.

34:22.712 --> 34:25.976
Maybe it's time you start
facing things on your own.

34:54.744 --> 34:56.703
I've never really
been a fan of
parties like this.

34:57.660 --> 34:58.792
It seems you aren't either.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.188
I'm Mac, short for MacMurph.

35:06.408 --> 35:08.106
Brutus sends his regards.

35:12.675 --> 35:13.720
Brutus?

35:13.763 --> 35:15.765
You're going to
follow me outside.

35:15.809 --> 35:18.638
Otherwise, your friends
over there...

35:18.681 --> 35:20.466
Well, they might not like
how this party ends.

35:23.164 --> 35:24.078
Whenever you're ready.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.363
I'm glad you've
decided to be sensible.

35:48.407 --> 35:50.017
Shows promise.

35:50.060 --> 35:52.193
I don't want
my friends to get hurt.

35:52.237 --> 35:53.194
I'm not here for them.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.241
I have a message from Brutus.

35:56.284 --> 35:58.330
The bad guy
from my home planet?

35:59.461 --> 36:00.767
He wants you to join him.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.772
You don't belong here, Naomi.

36:05.815 --> 36:08.340
This planet
doesn't deserve you.

36:08.383 --> 36:10.559
If you join us,
you can come home.

36:13.388 --> 36:14.868
This is my home.

36:18.654 --> 36:20.178
It's not really optional.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.009
Ah. Not bad.

37:03.482 --> 37:05.658
There's only one way this ends.

37:05.701 --> 37:07.486
You're going to
regret this, Akira.

37:16.364 --> 37:17.452
You all right?

37:19.324 --> 37:21.108
Yeah, I am.

37:24.894 --> 37:27.462
I can't believe I missed
an epic super-fight

37:27.506 --> 37:30.596
because I was trying
to get the DJ to play
Olivia Rodrigo.

37:30.639 --> 37:33.425
That is a whole new
category of FOMO.

37:33.468 --> 37:34.904
I can't believe
I was in a fight.

37:35.818 --> 37:36.645
And I won.

37:38.517 --> 37:40.214
Kind of, I guess
it was technically a tie.

37:42.303 --> 37:45.524
I really hope my utter failure
to secure your fresh fit

37:45.567 --> 37:48.918
is not the reason that
you're checking out of
casa deAnnabelle.

37:48.962 --> 37:49.919
I love it here.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.880
But I need to face
my parents.

37:56.578 --> 37:57.710
I'm gonna be okay.

37:58.363 --> 37:59.929
Yeah, you are.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.542
Look at you putting on
your "big girl" cape.

38:05.326 --> 38:08.024
The helicopter
is not a good look
on Greg and Jen.

38:10.462 --> 38:12.594
It's Nathan.

38:12.638 --> 38:14.335
I knew that he would
come to his senses.

38:14.379 --> 38:17.164
Bet it was those fire
road trip selfies
you took with Lourdes.

38:18.383 --> 38:19.209
Too soon.

38:20.428 --> 38:21.473
-Yeah.
-Too soon, yeah.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.650
Thank you
for letting me crash here.

38:24.693 --> 38:27.000
And thank you for being
such a good friend.

38:27.043 --> 38:28.741
Not just tonight,
but always.

38:30.438 --> 38:31.613
Ride or ride.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.325
Naomi?

38:54.027 --> 38:54.941
You're still up.

38:55.681 --> 38:57.247
Do... do you want to talk?

38:59.162 --> 39:02.122
We'll tell you anything
you want to know,
we promise.

39:02.165 --> 39:03.341
I'm not ready to talk.

39:04.907 --> 39:05.778
Not yet.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.216
I just want to go to sleep.

39:11.044 --> 39:12.045
Of course.

39:14.874 --> 39:16.354
We're... we're just glad
you're home.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.052
I need you to understand

39:20.662 --> 39:23.012
that this doesn't mean
that everything's okay.

39:24.187 --> 39:25.145
We understand.

39:26.625 --> 39:28.714
We're here, always.

39:33.545 --> 39:34.807
Good night.

39:51.345 --> 39:52.259
Any sign of Mac?

39:52.302 --> 39:53.956
No, she'll be back.

39:55.262 --> 39:56.698
She'll return
with others.

40:01.703 --> 40:05.838
It's been a very long time
since you and I had
a drink together.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.927
Let's hope it ends better
than last time.

40:21.506 --> 40:22.420
You were right.

40:23.725 --> 40:24.944
Naomi is special.

40:26.293 --> 40:28.208
I understand that now.

40:28.251 --> 40:31.646
-But that doesn't mean
she's ready.
-Is anyone truly ever ready?

40:31.690 --> 40:33.126
Does she know what's coming?

40:34.170 --> 40:35.084
Some.

40:36.738 --> 40:38.523
But not all.

40:38.566 --> 40:42.004
The fate of an entire planet
would be too much
for anyone to bear,

40:42.048 --> 40:44.920
but especially
for a 16-year-old girl.

40:44.964 --> 40:47.314
She's stronger than
you think, Akira.

40:47.357 --> 40:49.272
It's not a question
of strength.

40:49.316 --> 40:52.624
Brutus believes her
to be a threat
to his very existence.

40:52.667 --> 40:54.756
He will not stop
until he's killed her.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.628
We won't let that happen.

40:57.629 --> 41:00.501
Everyone Naomi knows.

41:00.545 --> 41:02.590
Everyone she loves.

41:02.634 --> 41:04.244
They are all in danger now.

41:10.642 --> 41:11.947
So we protect them.

41:13.906 --> 41:14.907
And her.

41:16.735 --> 41:17.692
No matter the cost.
