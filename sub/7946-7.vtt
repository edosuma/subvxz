07:20.709 --> 07:21.855
Hey, Jessie, this'll be

07:21.856 --> 07:23.000
a great story

07:20.709 --> 07:23.000
to tell our kids.

07:24.834 --> 07:26.667
- Are you guys
- wearing my makeup?

07:26.709 --> 07:28.435
- Forget the foundation, - soldier.
- (SHRIEKS)

07:28.459 --> 07:29.792
But it's really expensive!

07:29.834 --> 07:31.954
- It doesn't even match - their skin tones!
- Come on!

07:37.667 --> 07:39.334
Cease fire! Cease fire!

07:39.375 --> 07:41.209
- Stand down,
- my merry muchachos!

07:43.417 --> 07:44.709
Hey!

07:44.751 --> 07:46.667
- When my dad and
- I played Capture the Flag,

07:46.709 --> 07:47.959
We never used snowballs!

07:48.000 --> 07:49.876
You were in Texas!

07:49.918 --> 07:51.751
- The closest thing
- you had to a snowball

07:51.792 --> 07:52.918
Was a rolled up

07:52.919 --> 07:54.042
prairie dog.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.542
Yeah, chillax,

07:55.543 --> 07:57.000
General Buzzkill.

07:57.042 --> 07:58.481
All we're doing is putting

07:58.482 --> 07:59.918
a little snow day

07:57.042 --> 07:59.918
twist on the game.

07:59.959 --> 08:01.480
Starting now, if you

08:01.481 --> 08:03.000
get hit with one of these,

07:59.959 --> 08:03.000
you're out.

08:03.042 --> 08:04.709
That's not in the rules!

08:04.751 --> 08:06.751
Hey, you know what they say.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.542
- "Rules are like
- curfews and wind,

08:08.584 --> 08:10.959
"made to be broken."

08:11.000 --> 08:12.147
Just because

08:12.148 --> 08:13.292
the sticker on your

08:11.000 --> 08:13.292
skateboard says that

08:13.334 --> 08:14.626
doesn't make it true.

08:17.417 --> 08:18.751
- BERTRAM:
- Who made this mess?

08:19.834 --> 08:21.542
Hey!

08:21.584 --> 08:22.647
I'm not playing

08:22.648 --> 08:23.709
your stupid game!

08:23.751 --> 08:25.167
- I know.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)

08:25.918 --> 08:27.042
Halt!

08:27.083 --> 08:28.709
- He could be
- wearing a wire.

08:28.751 --> 08:29.792
Pat him down!

08:29.834 --> 08:31.667
- Gross!
- You do it.

08:33.375 --> 08:35.001
Yeah, you know what,

08:35.001 --> 08:36.626
it's a risk we'll take.

08:36.667 --> 08:37.730
So this is what

08:37.731 --> 08:38.792
happened to all

08:36.667 --> 08:38.792
of my blankets.

08:38.833 --> 08:40.708
- I'm freezing,
- gimme those!

08:40.751 --> 08:42.082
- Ooh, sorry,
- big guy.

08:42.125 --> 08:43.852
- We needed your blankies
- to make a bunker.

08:43.876 --> 08:45.709
- The good people
- of Fort Awesome thank you.

08:46.959 --> 08:48.083
If you're cold,

08:48.125 --> 08:49.293
why don't you try

08:49.294 --> 08:50.459
movie around, like us?

08:50.500 --> 08:51.834
I'd rather freeze to death.

08:53.459 --> 08:55.375
- Hey, is that
- my underwear?

08:55.417 --> 08:57.334
- Yeah. We used it
- to make our flag.

08:57.375 --> 08:58.584
Why would you do that?

08:58.626 --> 09:00.334
- Because it makes it
- much less likely

09:00.375 --> 09:02.176
- That the other team
- will want to touch it.

09:06.292 --> 09:07.668
I can't believe you

09:07.669 --> 09:09.042
wasted two rolls

09:06.292 --> 09:09.042
of toilet paper

09:09.083 --> 09:10.751
- to make those
- binoculars.

09:10.792 --> 09:11.897
Oh, I used the

09:11.898 --> 09:13.000
toilet paper.

09:13.042 --> 09:14.792
- Conflict gives me
- tummy issues.

09:15.876 --> 09:17.876
But never fear,

09:17.918 --> 09:19.147
I won't let a little case

09:19.148 --> 09:20.375
of the rumbles get in the

09:17.918 --> 09:20.375
way of being brave!

09:21.626 --> 09:22.855
Ah! There they are!

09:22.856 --> 09:24.083
Zuri, protect me!

09:24.125 --> 09:26.042
- Get ready for an
- epic brain-freeze!

09:26.083 --> 09:27.918
Emma!

09:27.959 --> 09:28.959
Right on, sister!

09:31.000 --> 09:32.040
- No, give me
- a snowball.

09:34.334 --> 09:35.876
- You didn't bring
- the snowballs?

09:35.918 --> 09:37.476
- I haven't finished
- decorating them yet.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.605
I couldn't decide between

09:38.606 --> 09:39.709
glitter glue or puff paint.

09:41.083 --> 09:42.918
- How about neither?
- It's snow!

09:42.959 --> 09:44.356
Who taught you

09:44.357 --> 09:45.751
military strategy?

09:42.959 --> 09:45.751
Martha Stewart?

09:45.792 --> 09:46.835
Who taught you

09:46.836 --> 09:47.876
how to have fun?

09:45.792 --> 09:47.876
A dentist?

09:49.918 --> 09:51.667
- What's the
- emergency, G.I. Bros?

09:51.709 --> 09:53.542
Enemy at 12 o'clock!

09:54.751 --> 09:56.000
I think!

09:56.042 --> 09:58.002
- I learned how to tell
- time on a digital clock.

09:59.083 --> 10:01.000
- Jessie's team is
- making their move!

10:01.042 --> 10:02.393
- Okay, they've got us
- pinned down!

10:02.417 --> 10:03.709
- We gotta make
- a run for it.

10:03.751 --> 10:05.042
Ready? Set?

10:05.083 --> 10:06.792
(EMMA SHRIEKING)

10:08.500 --> 10:10.000
You didn't wait for "go!"

10:10.042 --> 10:11.834
- Seriously, who
- goes on "set"?

10:14.584 --> 10:15.709
That was disgraceful,

10:15.710 --> 10:16.834
maggots!

10:16.876 --> 10:17.918
Emma, you almost got us

10:17.919 --> 10:18.959
chilled out there.

10:20.876 --> 10:22.584
- Luckily, I have
- a backup plan.

10:22.626 --> 10:23.730
I have a

10:23.731 --> 10:24.834
back-up plan, too.

10:24.876 --> 10:26.855
$4,000 for the

10:26.856 --> 10:28.834
battery pack.

10:28.876 --> 10:30.168
You've got to earn that

10:30.169 --> 10:31.459
battery pack, soldier!

10:31.500 --> 10:32.751
But when we win,

10:32.752 --> 10:34.000
you're paying for one heck

10:31.500 --> 10:34.000
of a victory party.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.022
This is a live feed

10:38.023 --> 10:39.542
into Hudson's fort.

10:39.584 --> 10:41.101
- I strapped a camera
- to Mrs. Kipling's head.

10:41.125 --> 10:42.396
By the way, if anyone

10:42.397 --> 10:43.667
finds the end

10:41.125 --> 10:43.667
of a pinky, it's mine.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.542
What!

10:46.584 --> 10:47.731
How could you put

10:47.732 --> 10:48.876
my soul mate in peril?

10:48.918 --> 10:50.439
Okay, we have to talk

10:50.440 --> 10:51.959
about boundaries between

10:48.918 --> 10:51.959
and that lizard.

10:54.792 --> 10:55.918
Perfect! Now we

10:55.919 --> 10:57.042
know the exact

10:54.792 --> 10:57.042
location of their flag.

10:59.083 --> 11:00.209
(SCOFFS)

11:00.250 --> 11:01.834
Nice try, guys.

11:01.876 --> 11:03.647
Mrs. K., get ready

11:03.648 --> 11:05.417
to be colder blooded.

11:01.876 --> 11:05.417
(CROAKING)

11:05.459 --> 11:06.542
(LAUGHS MANICALLY)

11:07.834 --> 11:10.125
No!

11:10.167 --> 11:11.960
If Mrs. Kipling gets

11:11.961 --> 11:13.751
the sniffles, it is on you!

11:13.792 --> 11:14.876
Literally, when she

11:14.877 --> 11:15.959
sneezes, it goes 20 feet.

11:17.918 --> 11:19.876
- Jessie, this is
- supposed to be fun,

11:19.918 --> 11:21.459
- But all you've done
- is criticize me

11:21.500 --> 11:23.000
- And endanger
- Ravi's life partner!

11:24.709 --> 11:26.688
Yes, obviously all you care

11:26.689 --> 11:28.667
about is beating Hudson.

11:28.709 --> 11:30.500
- Well, you can
- do it without me.

11:30.542 --> 11:31.564
Wait. Ravi.

11:31.565 --> 11:32.584
Come, on. I need you.

11:32.626 --> 11:34.167
Really?

11:34.209 --> 11:36.101
- You did not listen - to any of my plans
- To try and help.

11:36.125 --> 11:38.022
The only thing you

11:38.023 --> 11:39.918
let me contribute was a

11:36.125 --> 11:39.918
delightful cranberry spritzer.

11:40.584 --> 11:41.834
Okay.

11:41.876 --> 11:43.709
- I actually asked
- for an orange juice.

11:45.709 --> 11:46.935
- You know, Jessie,
- for the first time,

11:46.959 --> 11:48.918
- I was excited to be
- part of a team.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.459
Because I thought you,

11:50.460 --> 11:51.959
of all people,

11:48.959 --> 11:51.959
would give me a chance.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.918
- But I see now
- that I was mistaken.

11:53.959 --> 11:54.959
I quit!

11:56.667 --> 11:57.834
Me, too.

11:57.876 --> 11:59.626
- Keep your stupid
- battery pack!

11:59.667 --> 12:01.230
I don't care if I'm as

12:01.231 --> 12:02.792
socially irrelevant as

11:59.667 --> 12:02.792
Jennifer Higgenbottom.

12:02.834 --> 12:04.751
- Who's Jennifer Higgenbottom?
- Exactly.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.083
Come on, Ravi.

12:09.083 --> 12:11.125
Guys!

12:11.167 --> 12:12.376
ZURI: Eat snow, suckers!

12:12.377 --> 12:13.584
(RAVI AND EMMA SCREAMING)

12:16.709 --> 12:18.667
Okay, we still quit,

12:18.709 --> 12:19.918
- but we shall
- wait in here.

12:25.959 --> 12:27.042
- I don't get it,
- Bertram.

12:27.083 --> 12:28.792
- When I was a kid,
- I used to love

12:28.834 --> 12:30.059
- Playing Capture
- the Flag with my father.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.042
- I mean, sure, he
- was ultra-competitive

12:32.083 --> 12:33.959
And never let me win,

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
and by the end

12:35.001 --> 12:36.000
my spirit was

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
utterly broken, but...

12:37.751 --> 12:38.918
It was...

12:38.959 --> 12:40.000
- Fun?
- Yeah.

12:41.709 --> 12:43.792
Well, maybe not fun...

12:43.834 --> 12:45.042
It was a learning experience.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.959
It built character.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.522
Oh, who am I kidding?

12:49.523 --> 12:51.042
I hated that stupid game!

12:51.083 --> 12:53.501
Well, I can see why

12:53.502 --> 12:55.918
you wanted to continue

12:51.083 --> 12:55.918
that lovely family tradition.

12:55.959 --> 12:57.897
What's next,

12:57.898 --> 12:59.834
a scavenger hunt

12:55.959 --> 12:59.834
through the firing range?

12:59.876 --> 13:00.938
Don't be ridiculous,

13:00.939 --> 13:02.000
that's where

12:59.876 --> 13:02.000
we play Red Rover.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.042
Oh, no!

13:06.083 --> 13:07.397
I just had the most

13:07.398 --> 13:08.709
horrifying realization.

13:09.125 --> 13:11.584
I've become my father!

13:13.083 --> 13:14.647
Jessie, no,

13:14.648 --> 13:16.209
you haven't.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.250
He's married.

13:19.125 --> 13:20.501
Look, we're all

13:20.502 --> 13:21.876
a product of our parents.

13:21.918 --> 13:23.292
Like, thanks to my mom,

13:23.334 --> 13:24.667
I have an irrational

13:24.668 --> 13:26.000
fear of showgirls

13:23.334 --> 13:26.000
and bread pudding.

13:27.083 --> 13:28.083
Don't ask.

13:29.751 --> 13:31.042
- The point is,
- you can embrace

13:31.083 --> 13:32.583
All the great things

13:32.584 --> 13:34.083
your dad did as a parent,

13:34.125 --> 13:35.584
but choose to do some

13:35.585 --> 13:37.042
things differently.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.167
Maybe you're right.

13:38.209 --> 13:39.564
Maybe I don't have

13:39.565 --> 13:40.918
to win at all costs,

13:40.959 --> 13:42.105
or routinely check my

13:42.106 --> 13:43.250
shoe rack for explosives.

13:44.083 --> 13:46.709
Don't ask.

13:46.751 --> 13:48.835
Jessie, so far your

13:48.836 --> 13:50.918
influence on these kids

13:46.751 --> 13:50.918
has been pretty good.

13:51.751 --> 13:54.000
So, just do it your way.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.834
- Thank you, Bertram.
- You're welcome.

13:59.876 --> 14:00.959
(CHUCKLES)

14:02.083 --> 14:03.209
- Snow cone?
- Yeah.

14:03.250 --> 14:04.292
(BERTRAM CHUCKLES)

14:04.334 --> 14:05.918
- Wait, where did
- you get these?

14:05.959 --> 14:07.709
Mmm, from this cooler.

14:07.751 --> 14:08.876
This one has sprinkles!

14:10.918 --> 14:12.125
This is our ammo!

14:12.167 --> 14:13.376
And those aren't sprinkles,

14:13.377 --> 14:14.584
that's glitter glue.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.042
Ugh!

14:21.083 --> 14:23.042
- Why do they make
- books so long?

14:23.083 --> 14:24.185
- If you can't say what
- you need to say

14:24.209 --> 14:26.167
- In 140 characters,
- you shouldn't be a writer.

14:28.334 --> 14:29.688
Hey, guys, there's something

14:29.689 --> 14:31.042
I need to say to you.

14:31.083 --> 14:32.209
I will go squeeze you

14:32.210 --> 14:33.334
some orange juice.

14:34.417 --> 14:36.834
No. I mean...

14:36.876 --> 14:38.814
I just realized I made the

14:38.815 --> 14:40.751
same mistake with you guys

14:36.876 --> 14:40.751
that my father made with me.

14:41.834 --> 14:42.939
I forgot that the point

14:42.940 --> 14:44.042
of a family game

14:44.083 --> 14:45.522
is not to win, but to

14:45.523 --> 14:46.959
have fun together.

14:47.918 --> 14:48.959
I'm really sorry.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.918
- Can you guys
- forgive me?

14:52.959 --> 14:53.876
Of course.

14:53.918 --> 14:55.292
Absolutely.

14:55.334 --> 14:56.334
Aw!

14:58.042 --> 15:00.584
Well, guess I'll go

15:00.585 --> 15:03.125
surrender our flag to

14:58.042 --> 15:03.125
the Abominable Bro-man.

15:03.167 --> 15:04.230
And then you can

15:04.231 --> 15:05.292
do whatever you guys

15:03.167 --> 15:05.292
want to do.

15:06.083 --> 15:07.125
Uh, Jessie...

15:08.417 --> 15:10.250
- Do you know what
- we want to do?

15:10.292 --> 15:11.646
Ravi, we can't go

15:11.647 --> 15:13.000
to the science center.

15:10.292 --> 15:13.000
All the roads are closed.

15:14.209 --> 15:15.417
No!

15:15.459 --> 15:17.751
We want to win the game!

15:17.792 --> 15:19.042
You do?

15:19.083 --> 15:20.125
BOTH: Yeah.

15:20.167 --> 15:22.083
All right, let's do this.

15:22.125 --> 15:23.939
Ravi, you said you

15:23.940 --> 15:25.751
had some ideas on how

15:22.125 --> 15:25.751
to win this thing.

15:25.792 --> 15:26.792
Lay 'em on me.

15:28.834 --> 15:30.792
- JESSIE: Those are horrible
- ideas, maggot!

15:30.834 --> 15:31.939
Well, if you do not

15:31.940 --> 15:33.042
like this maggot's ideas,

15:33.083 --> 15:34.542
then I will find

15:34.543 --> 15:36.000
a team that does!

15:36.042 --> 15:37.083
Oh!

15:37.125 --> 15:38.563
Please do not pelt

15:38.564 --> 15:40.000
me with snowballs!

15:40.042 --> 15:41.042
I wish to defect

15:41.043 --> 15:42.043
to your team!

15:42.083 --> 15:43.688
Why not? He can't be

15:43.689 --> 15:45.292
any worse than Stuart.

15:45.334 --> 15:46.876
- Come on over
- to our side.

15:46.918 --> 15:47.918
We're always looking

15:47.919 --> 15:48.919
for a few brave bros!

15:48.959 --> 15:51.240
- At the very least, - we can use him
- As a human shield.

15:51.834 --> 15:52.918
Hey, good

15:52.919 --> 15:54.000
to have you.

15:56.918 --> 15:59.042
EMMA: Luke!

15:59.083 --> 16:00.542
Whoa, whoa,

16:00.543 --> 16:02.000
I'm not playing anymore.

16:02.042 --> 16:03.042
If you want the flag,

16:03.043 --> 16:04.043
just go get it.

16:04.083 --> 16:06.167
Oh, just like that, huh?

16:06.209 --> 16:08.042
Yes. I just need a favor.

16:08.083 --> 16:10.125
- Sophie and Brianna
- are coming over to hang out.

16:10.167 --> 16:11.959
Wait.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.167
- Sophie and Brianna
- from the cheerleading squad?

16:15.209 --> 16:16.834
They are so cute.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.918
And bouncy.

16:19.959 --> 16:21.480
They wanted to know if you

16:21.481 --> 16:23.000
could hold their pom-poms

16:19.959 --> 16:23.000
while they practice.

16:23.042 --> 16:24.918
- Oh, man,
- I gotta go shower!

16:24.959 --> 16:26.001
This is the special

16:26.002 --> 16:27.042
occasion I've been

16:24.959 --> 16:27.042

16:29.083 --> 16:30.459
- Ah!

16:33.085 --> 16:34.250
You're done, son!

16:34.292 --> 16:36.167
- Nice outfit,
- Admiral Adorbs!

16:36.209 --> 16:37.918
- Back at ya,
- Captain Couture.

16:38.250 --> 16:39.959
I get it.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.500
You two tricked me!

16:41.542 --> 16:44.417
It'll never happen again!

16:44.459 --> 16:46.659
- Now, what time are - those cheerleaders
- Coming over?

16:51.375 --> 16:52.793
I'm telling you,

16:52.794 --> 16:54.209
Zuri, you can't go

16:51.375 --> 16:54.209
in there alone.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.042
It's not worth it!

16:56.083 --> 16:58.042
- I need that
- battery pack.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.292
I've got inside info

16:59.293 --> 17:00.500
on some tech stocks,

17:00.542 --> 17:02.125
- and the market
- is about to close!

17:03.918 --> 17:05.375
But, Zuri...

17:05.416 --> 17:07.041
Zuri! No!

17:07.083 --> 17:09.000
Blizzard time!

(PANTING)

17:13.083 --> 17:14.541
Huh?

17:14.584 --> 17:15.876
They're not even

17:15.877 --> 17:17.166
guarding their flag?

17:17.209 --> 17:19.000
Don't mind if I do.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.083
Surprise!

17:23.584 --> 17:24.834
No!

17:30.083 --> 17:31.125
Nice shot, Emma.

17:32.083 --> 17:33.083
Stuart!

17:33.959 --> 17:35.042
Is it bad, Zuri?

17:35.083 --> 17:36.959
Tell me the truth...

17:37.000 --> 17:38.918
- I'm not gonna
- make it, am I?

17:38.959 --> 17:40.250
Don't talk like that!

17:40.292 --> 17:41.918
You're gonna be okay.

17:41.959 --> 17:44.542

penetrated my sweater-vest.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.334
You guys are weird.

17:53.375 --> 17:55.656
- I can't believe we - were ever losing
- To these people.

17:59.083 --> 18:00.959
- You're out!
- (CHUCKLES)

18:04.209 --> 18:06.042
I'm sorry, Zuri.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.375
- I've failed you
- yet again.

18:07.417 --> 18:08.918
No, you didn't.

18:08.959 --> 18:10.126
You sacrificed yourself

18:10.127 --> 18:11.292
to try to save me.

18:11.334 --> 18:12.959
And that's true bravery.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.125
You're my hero.

18:16.083 --> 18:17.042
Wow!

18:17.083 --> 18:18.105
And I'm not even

18:18.106 --> 18:19.125
wearing my bravery pants!

(PANTING)

18:22.292 --> 18:23.476
- What happened
- down there, man?

18:23.500 --> 18:24.959
It was a massacre!

18:25.000 --> 18:26.022
We lost all of

18:26.023 --> 18:27.042
our best warriors...

18:27.083 --> 18:28.250
And Stuart!

18:30.042 --> 18:31.602
- And now, you're gonna
- lose the game!

18:34.083 --> 18:35.083
Emma, take cover.

18:36.626 --> 18:37.584
Let's waste 'em!

18:37.626 --> 18:39.959
Ravi, toss me some ammo!

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Ravi?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.480
Hey, what's going on,

18:44.481 --> 18:45.959
little buddy?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.522
You poor fool!

18:47.523 --> 18:49.042
I never defected.

18:49.083 --> 18:50.542
It was Ravi's

18:50.543 --> 18:52.000
brilliant plan to

18:49.083 --> 18:52.000
infiltrate your team.

18:52.667 --> 18:54.459
Ravi?

18:54.500 --> 18:56.543
So, these friendship

18:56.544 --> 18:58.584
bro-celets we made

18:54.500 --> 18:58.584
meant nothing to you?

18:58.626 --> 18:59.689
Oh, no, I will cherish

18:59.690 --> 19:00.751
these forever.

19:00.792 --> 19:02.059
- My friendship circle
- is somewhat limited...

19:02.083 --> 19:03.844
- Quit talking and throw
- the dang snowball!

19:04.626 --> 19:05.647

19:15.335 --> 19:16.959
have to travel far

19:33.898 --> 19:35.042
as your breath.

19:35.083 --> 19:36.626
Hey!

19:36.667 --> 19:37.834
I ate that yellow snow

19:37.835 --> 19:39.000

Well, at least

20:23.356 --> 20:24.626
for once a man

20:22.083 --> 20:24.626
is chasing her.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.647
Hey, cool.

22:40.648 --> 22:41.834
Ravi, now you can

22:39.459 --> 22:41.834
do my homework.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.751
HUDSON: Oh, whoa!

22:44.792 --> 22:46.397
I would hate to be

22:46.398 --> 22:48.000
the poor sap who

22:44.792 --> 22:48.000
has to clean this place up!

22:48.042 --> 22:49.042
(CHUCKLES)

22:49.542 --> 22:50.542
Ow!

22:51.417 --> 22:53.209
I'm that poor sap!

22:53.250 --> 22:54.564
Hey! We're not playing

22:54.565 --> 22:55.876
that game anymore.

22:55.918 --> 22:56.709
I know!

22:56.751 --> 22:58.542
(ALL SCREAMING)

23:00.667 --> 23:01.709
(LAUGHING)

23:01.751 --> 23:03.185
- For a man who gets
- winded beating eggs,

23:03.209 --> 23:04.369
- He's got a heck
- of an arm!
