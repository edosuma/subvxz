00:01.891 --> 00:03.748
He is your ex, right?

00:03.773 --> 00:05.339
- Not even friends.
- What happened?

00:05.341 --> 00:06.641
I'm transferring to Wycoff.

00:06.643 --> 00:08.409
I don't know if I want you here.

00:08.411 --> 00:10.211
- I'm leaving.
- <i>Don't worry about Jenna.</i>

00:10.213 --> 00:12.085
You are in New York City.

00:12.535 --> 00:15.117
Luke? Jenna?

00:15.125 --> 00:17.491
I'm a little surprised
by what I'm seeing.

00:17.516 --> 00:19.116
I can't say that I'm pleased.

00:19.141 --> 00:21.175
In fact, I'm pretty annoyed.

00:21.625 --> 00:23.992
Whenever you come in early to write,

00:23.993 --> 00:27.227
always make sure there
is a fresh pot of coffee.

00:27.229 --> 00:28.662
Oh. Sorry, Lizzy.

00:28.664 --> 00:31.298
We just got so caught up in writing.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.598
I love writing.

00:32.601 --> 00:34.701
And I love your work ethic, Jenna.

00:34.726 --> 00:36.247
Well, I would love it
more if you got published,

00:36.272 --> 00:39.506
but today, you are my
favorite editorial fellow,

00:39.867 --> 00:41.320
despite the coffee incident.

00:42.578 --> 00:44.711
Ophelia's piece on
how weird her boobs are

00:44.713 --> 00:47.748
has gotten so much traffic,
it has crashed the servers.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.516
She's my favorite fellow.

00:49.518 --> 00:52.119
Well, it was good while it lasted.

00:52.121 --> 00:54.021
Well, just because the
servers aren't connecting

00:54.023 --> 00:55.889
doesn't mean that we shouldn't.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.693
Connection...

00:59.695 --> 01:01.328
That is what we need with our readers,

01:01.330 --> 01:04.164
and we connect by exposing
ourselves in our writing.

01:04.166 --> 01:08.435
Jenna, your pieces haven't had
the certain raw vulnerability

01:08.437 --> 01:09.903
our Idea Bin readers want.

01:10.406 --> 01:12.565
Think. How can you expose yourself?

01:13.765 --> 01:16.677
Well, um, my boobs are
pretty normal, so...

01:16.679 --> 01:18.245
It's not about your normal boobs, Jenna.

01:18.247 --> 01:20.213
This is about authenticity.

01:20.215 --> 01:22.082
Let's do an exercise.

01:22.084 --> 01:23.750
I'm gonna ask you a question,

01:23.752 --> 01:25.819
and you're going to be
truly honest with me,

01:25.821 --> 01:28.422
as honest as I want you
to be in your writing.

01:28.424 --> 01:32.259
For example, describe your
last sexual experience.

01:37.232 --> 01:38.999
Synced and corrected by Chitorafa
www.addic7ed.com

01:41.070 --> 01:42.669
My last...

01:42.671 --> 01:45.188
sexual experience was...

01:46.842 --> 01:47.941
recent.

01:47.943 --> 01:49.242
And?

01:49.244 --> 01:51.244
Yeah, Jenna. Tell us more.

01:51.246 --> 01:52.453
<i>What could I say?</i>

01:52.478 --> 01:54.147
<i>I was supposed to be
writing last night,</i>

01:54.149 --> 01:56.083
<i>and instead, I slept with Luke.</i>

01:56.085 --> 01:58.518
<i>Idea Bin was my big shot,
and I couldn't mess it up</i>

01:58.520 --> 02:00.828
<i>by getting distracted
with Luke drama.</i>

02:01.423 --> 02:03.915
It was no big deal.

02:04.143 --> 02:05.476
Oh, so it sucked.

02:05.501 --> 02:06.733
No. No, no, no.

02:06.758 --> 02:07.791
It was great.

02:07.816 --> 02:09.070
It's just that

02:09.565 --> 02:13.210
no one should read too
much into it, you know?

02:13.235 --> 02:14.835
No, not really.

02:16.008 --> 02:18.142
You are so insightful.

02:18.144 --> 02:20.377
And you've reached so many people.

02:20.379 --> 02:22.246
You remind me of myself.

02:22.248 --> 02:23.480
Call a doctor, Oph,

02:23.482 --> 02:24.715
'cause you broke the Internet.

02:24.717 --> 02:27.151
- Boom.
- Thanks, you guys. You know,

02:27.153 --> 02:29.854
I'm just really glad that
people responded to my honesty.

02:29.856 --> 02:31.722
And your brilliance.

02:31.724 --> 02:34.692
Max, Mia, come with me.

02:34.694 --> 02:37.228
We're gonna do a writing exercise.

02:37.531 --> 02:39.096
Max,

02:39.098 --> 02:42.399
tell me about the first time
your mother made you cry.

02:44.971 --> 02:46.342
<i>I had to admit it.</i>

02:46.367 --> 02:48.084
<i>I was jealous of Ophelia.</i>

02:48.109 --> 02:49.983
<i>She was part of the
cool kid clique.</i>

02:50.008 --> 02:52.408
<i>Idea Bin was just like
high school, except now,</i>

02:52.410 --> 02:55.245
<i>the popular people were
smart, accomplished writers.</i>

02:55.247 --> 02:58.148
<i>It was time for me to
get in with the in crowd.</i>

02:58.150 --> 02:59.816
Hey, Ethan. Want to grab lunch later?

02:59.818 --> 03:01.251
There's this awesome new vegan place.

03:01.253 --> 03:04.354
Huh? Oh, sorry Jenna. Love you. Mean it.

03:04.356 --> 03:06.389
But I'm writing a follow-up
quiz to Oph's piece

03:06.391 --> 03:09.359
called "What Weird
Celebrity Boobs Do You Have?"

03:09.632 --> 03:10.693
Talk later, 'kay?

03:10.695 --> 03:11.780
Sure.

03:12.697 --> 03:14.297
<i>Ethan might be a
tough one to crack,</i>

03:14.299 --> 03:17.734
<i>but Ophelia, if nothing
else, was all about sharing.</i>

03:17.736 --> 03:19.602
Congrats, Oph.

03:19.604 --> 03:21.070
- I loved your piece.
- Mm, thanks.

03:21.072 --> 03:22.772
- That means a lot.
- <i>Okay.</i>

03:22.774 --> 03:26.109
<i>Clearly I had to initiate
the friendly conversation.</i>

03:26.111 --> 03:28.278
So do you have a boyfriend?

03:28.280 --> 03:30.346
Oh, I don't believe in monogamy.

03:30.348 --> 03:33.550
But I do have a crush
on someone in the office.

03:33.552 --> 03:36.219
He's smart, nice, cute.

03:36.221 --> 03:37.921
<i>Was she talking about Luke?</i>

03:37.923 --> 03:39.255
<i>No, I shouldn't care.</i>

03:39.257 --> 03:40.556
It's Ethan.

03:41.359 --> 03:43.498
But Ethan's...

03:43.523 --> 03:44.761
Oh, I am dying to
hook up with a gay guy.

03:44.763 --> 03:45.995
It would be such good material,

03:45.997 --> 03:48.104
and he'd probably text me back.

03:48.366 --> 03:50.150
You know, I've only
had one night stands?

03:50.702 --> 03:51.901
- Not on purpose.
- I'm sorry.

03:53.305 --> 03:54.765
- Do you want to talk about it?
- Not really.

03:54.790 --> 03:58.350
Anyways, Lizzy just IMed me
that your last sexual experience

03:58.375 --> 04:00.320
was "recent and no big deal."

04:00.345 --> 04:03.813
<i>Hearing my own words back, I
realized how harsh I sounded.</i>

04:03.815 --> 04:05.039
<i>No big deal?</i>

04:05.064 --> 04:07.283
<i>If a guy said that to me
after we slept together,</i>

04:07.285 --> 04:10.053
<i>I'd probably cry or
slap him or both.</i>

04:10.055 --> 04:11.487
Word travels fast around here.

04:11.489 --> 04:14.091
Oh, Ethan is too much.

04:14.793 --> 04:16.923
Okay, see ya.

04:19.831 --> 04:22.365
<i>Truth was, Ethan and Ophelia</i>

04:22.367 --> 04:24.234
<i>weren't letting me into
their cool kids' club</i>

04:24.236 --> 04:26.436
<i>because I hadn't been published.</i>

04:26.438 --> 04:28.438
<i>Clearly I needed to
write something amazing</i>

04:28.440 --> 04:30.440
<i>that would get published
on the Idea Bin site.</i>

04:30.442 --> 04:32.875
<i>But first, I had to
clear things up with Luke</i>

04:32.877 --> 04:35.169
<i>and nip any drama in the bud.</i>

04:35.780 --> 04:39.649
So no biggie, but I
totally got us a VIP table

04:39.651 --> 04:41.818
and bottle service tonight at Roundelay

04:41.820 --> 04:43.210
for your mother-effing birthday.

04:43.235 --> 04:44.701
Shut up.

04:44.726 --> 04:47.133
- You are welcome.
- A bottle service?

04:47.158 --> 04:48.725
Does that mean Morgan can come?

04:48.727 --> 04:50.293
No. Sorry.

04:50.295 --> 04:52.829
I'm pretty sure they
don't let babies in.

04:52.831 --> 04:54.163
But no thanks necessary.

04:54.165 --> 04:56.866
The bouncer is totally
friends with Rene at Teflon.

04:56.868 --> 04:59.625
No way. That is so clutch.

04:59.641 --> 05:00.940
Who's Rene at Teflon?

05:00.942 --> 05:02.275
Teflon is a club in New York Tamara

05:02.276 --> 05:03.942
- and I go to all the time.
- All the time.

05:03.944 --> 05:06.745
- And Rene's the bouncer there.
- And our BFF.

05:06.747 --> 05:09.081
O-M-G, remember the time
he kicked out Orlando Bloom?

05:09.083 --> 05:11.283
That was amaze. And we were like...

05:11.285 --> 05:13.118
"Bye."

05:13.120 --> 05:14.786
Neat. I can make cupcakes.

05:14.788 --> 05:16.889
Thanks, Liss, really, but I don't think

05:16.891 --> 05:18.757
the club allows outside food.

05:18.759 --> 05:20.626
Anyway, cupcakes are so 2005.

05:20.628 --> 05:22.060
You have got to try the crogel.

05:22.062 --> 05:23.929
- It's all about the crogel.
- Crogel?

05:23.931 --> 05:25.230
Croissant bagel.

05:25.232 --> 05:27.299
Sounds... ethnic.

05:27.301 --> 05:29.701
T, I can totally help pay for
bottle service, by the way.

05:29.703 --> 05:31.870
That [bleep] is expensive.

05:31.872 --> 05:33.472
Oh, yeah, uh, how much do you need?

05:33.474 --> 05:34.806
Like 20 bucks?

05:34.808 --> 05:36.375
You might want to add a zero to that.

05:36.377 --> 05:37.709
Bitches, please.

05:37.711 --> 05:39.845
The birthday girl
doesn't pay for anything.

05:39.847 --> 05:41.713
And thanks, Lissa, but it's on me.

05:44.218 --> 05:45.450
Waiter.

05:45.452 --> 05:47.819
I need a refill on my marg.

05:47.821 --> 05:49.688
I am not the waiter. I'm a manager.

05:49.690 --> 05:51.323
And you know my name is Jake.

05:51.325 --> 05:53.225
I'd be happy to send a
waiter over for you, though.

05:53.227 --> 05:55.827
I want it from you. No
one else makes them right.

05:55.829 --> 05:58.330
I'm sorry, Ally. I mean, Miss...

05:58.332 --> 06:02.000
You know my husband's on
the board of this club.

06:02.002 --> 06:04.603
- Of course I do.
- So that makes me your boss.

06:04.605 --> 06:06.438
And as your boss,

06:06.440 --> 06:10.955
I want a [bleep] marg.

06:11.345 --> 06:14.513
Fine.

06:14.515 --> 06:17.115
- Sip?
- Oh, sure, thanks.

06:19.485 --> 06:21.897
Oh, what is that, vodka?

06:21.922 --> 06:23.179
Boom, gotcha.

06:23.219 --> 06:24.518
What are you doing?

06:24.520 --> 06:26.093
You guys are children.

06:26.889 --> 06:28.312
Both of you go to Berkeley.

06:28.337 --> 06:30.912
Isn't that supposed to be a
good school, not a kindergarten?

06:30.937 --> 06:33.627
And, Sully, I know it's
your first week here,

06:33.629 --> 06:35.560
but there's no drinking at work,

06:35.585 --> 06:38.365
when you're lifeguarding, obviously.

06:38.390 --> 06:39.709
Sorry, boss.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.612
I mean, there's no one in the pool.

06:42.328 --> 06:43.637
But I see your point.

06:43.639 --> 06:45.249
We're sorry. We will stop.

06:45.562 --> 06:47.741
Good. I got to go get a friggin' marg.

06:47.743 --> 06:50.177
Stop it.

06:50.179 --> 06:52.146
I swear, that was my last prank.

06:52.148 --> 06:54.214
Well, now I got to get you back.

06:54.216 --> 06:55.816
- Oh.
- Right, yeah.

06:55.818 --> 06:57.651
Give me that bottle.

06:57.653 --> 06:59.019
Uh, but that's...

07:01.524 --> 07:03.223
Okay.

07:04.617 --> 07:06.817
I like her.

07:07.664 --> 07:08.740
<i>I knew it would hurt Luke</i>

07:08.765 --> 07:10.506
<i>when I told him that
we couldn't date,</i>

07:10.531 --> 07:13.699
<i>but I knew he appreciated
honesty and maturity.</i>

07:15.169 --> 07:17.601
Hey, I'm sorry if what I said earlier

07:17.609 --> 07:19.142
with Lizzy sounded harsh.

07:19.144 --> 07:22.412
What I meant to say was that I like you

07:22.414 --> 07:24.080
and that's why we can't start dating.

07:24.082 --> 07:26.082
- Come again?
- It's just that I need to

07:26.084 --> 07:28.184
concentrate on work
and if we're making out,

07:28.186 --> 07:29.953
then I'm going to be
concentrating on that,

07:29.955 --> 07:31.655
and I-I really need to get published

07:31.657 --> 07:34.024
and I can't have any drama.
Plus, I-I wouldn't want anyone

07:34.026 --> 07:36.526
to think I'm only here because of you.

07:36.528 --> 07:38.529
Jenna, it's cool. Like
you said, it's no big deal.

07:38.554 --> 07:40.263
The server's up. I got
to get back to work.

07:41.066 --> 07:43.400
Right. Back to work.

07:43.402 --> 07:46.381
<i>He had taken the news
well, really well.</i>

07:46.406 --> 07:48.676
<i>So why did I wish he hadn't?</i>

07:49.074 --> 07:51.474
<i>Then I realized I did like Luke,</i>

07:51.476 --> 07:53.610
<i>like, like liked Luke.</i>

07:53.612 --> 07:55.679
<i>Like, drama.</i>

07:58.383 --> 08:00.150
<i>Luke and I had agreed
that our one night stand</i>

08:00.152 --> 08:02.953
<i>had been no big deal,
but why had he agreed?</i>

08:02.955 --> 08:05.923
<i>And so quickly? Had he
not enjoyed himself?</i>

08:05.925 --> 08:08.992
<i>I needed some BFF analysis ASAP.</i>

08:10.492 --> 08:11.506
Hey.

08:12.731 --> 08:14.198
I slept with Luke last night.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.233
O-M-G.

08:16.235 --> 08:18.469
I know, and I told him
it couldn't happen again,

08:18.471 --> 08:20.104
but then he said it was no big deal.

08:20.106 --> 08:22.906
- That is a big deal!
- Yeah. But...

08:22.908 --> 08:25.142
You look like the ultimate
birthday bitch in that dress.

08:25.144 --> 08:27.077
- You have to wear it.
- <i>Who are you talking to?</i>

08:27.079 --> 08:28.745
Oh, sorry. I'm talking to Sadie.

08:28.747 --> 08:29.947
Wait, you slept with Luke?

08:29.949 --> 08:31.548
Jenna, we know how this story ends.

08:31.550 --> 08:33.283
Luke ends up getting stuck on a mountain

08:33.284 --> 08:35.352
- 'cause you run after Matty.
- Yeah, I know. It's drama.

08:35.354 --> 08:38.589
Which is why we can't
date, but I like him.

08:38.591 --> 08:40.224
Uh-huh. No. Sadie, hair down.

08:40.905 --> 08:43.861
Okay, maybe now's not
the best time to talk.

08:43.863 --> 08:45.329
Wanna have a sleepover?

08:45.331 --> 08:48.232
Pizza, pajamas, "Sound
of Music" sing-a-long?

08:48.234 --> 08:49.900
I feel like we haven't
spent any time together

08:49.902 --> 08:51.779
and I could really use a friend

08:51.804 --> 08:53.403
and I definitely don't have any at work.

08:53.405 --> 08:56.006
Oh, bummer summer, Jenna.
I already have plans.

08:56.008 --> 08:58.275
- Don't say [bleep].
- <i>What are your plans?</i>

08:58.277 --> 09:01.478
I-I'm going to Sadie's birthday party.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.647
Okay, well, well, I
could come, couldn't I?

09:03.649 --> 09:06.083
- <i>And we could hang there?</i>
- Yeah, totally.

09:06.085 --> 09:08.519
I just didn't think to
mention it, because, you know,

09:08.521 --> 09:11.355
you hate Sadie and Matty
and Sully are gonna be there.

09:11.357 --> 09:13.290
<i>As much as I wanted
to be mad at Tamara</i>

09:13.292 --> 09:15.873
<i>for not inviting me,
I couldn't blame her.</i>

09:15.898 --> 09:17.361
<i>A night trying to
reconnect with her</i>

09:17.363 --> 09:20.631
<i>surrounded by Sadie, Matty,
and Sully wasn't ideal.</i>

09:20.633 --> 09:22.466
I don't care. Count me in.

09:22.468 --> 09:24.101
Okay. Roundelay at 9:00.

09:24.103 --> 09:26.270
Wait, Roundelay? That
douchey club in Hollywood?

09:26.272 --> 09:28.872
O-M-G, Roundelay? I love Roundelay.

09:28.874 --> 09:32.643
Uh, I mean, Roundelay?
More like Round-a-yay.

09:32.645 --> 09:34.678
- I'll be there.
- I didn't think you'd be

09:34.680 --> 09:36.380
the type that would party at Roundelay.

09:36.382 --> 09:37.581
Yeah, I love that place.

09:37.583 --> 09:39.082
I'm there, like, all the time.

09:39.084 --> 09:40.584
<i>Ethan thought I was cool.</i>

09:40.586 --> 09:41.785
<i>I had to strike while
the iron was hot.</i>

09:41.787 --> 09:43.353
- You should come.
- Where?

09:43.355 --> 09:45.990
- Roundelay. Chic, right?
- Totally. I want to come.

09:46.015 --> 09:47.491
- We'll be there.
- Awesome.

09:47.493 --> 09:48.625
It starts at 9:00.

09:48.627 --> 09:50.294
Luke, you should come too.

09:50.296 --> 09:52.596
- Can't. I have drinks tonight.
- Ooh.

09:52.598 --> 09:54.865
- You got a hot date, hon?
- Maybe.

09:54.867 --> 09:56.633
<i>Luke had a date?</i>

09:56.635 --> 09:59.169
<i>Or worse, he didn't, and
he was trying to hurt me.</i>

09:59.171 --> 10:01.071
<i>Wait. Would that be worse?</i>

10:01.073 --> 10:04.274
<i>Ugh, how could avoiding
drama be so much drama?</i>

10:04.276 --> 10:06.043
Rude. I can't believe you invited

10:06.045 --> 10:08.278
Hamil-taint to my birthday.

10:08.280 --> 10:10.553
I know, but I was in an awk posish.

10:10.578 --> 10:14.147
Whatever. It's time to
extend another invite.

10:14.149 --> 10:17.116
I'm having Mexican for my birthday.

10:17.118 --> 10:20.386
Reality check. Your
ex-BF has a current GF.

10:20.388 --> 10:23.556
Like that matters. Sergio
has to come tonight,

10:23.558 --> 10:26.485
and then he has to have sex with me.

10:27.228 --> 10:30.839
That's, like, the law of birthdays.

10:33.835 --> 10:36.569
Man, this is living.

10:36.571 --> 10:40.039
Hey, Jake, you want to
open that beer for me?

10:42.210 --> 10:44.944
Okay.

10:46.781 --> 10:49.215
Ah, jeez. Ugh.

10:49.217 --> 10:51.350
I may have shaken that one up a bit.

10:51.352 --> 10:53.619
- Ha-ha.
- Suls, no pranks at work.

10:53.621 --> 10:56.589
It's after work. Jake thinks it's funny.

10:56.591 --> 10:57.614
Right, Jake?

10:58.359 --> 11:00.626
Yeah, right. Sorry, dude.

11:00.628 --> 11:04.197
I now our pranks are annoying
to everyone except us.

11:04.199 --> 11:05.798
Let's get you cleaned up.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.341
So...

11:08.374 --> 11:09.969
You want to do body shots?

11:09.971 --> 11:11.544
No.

11:12.474 --> 11:13.265
Huh.

11:13.290 --> 11:15.074
Sully's something.

11:15.076 --> 11:16.642
I know she can be a lot

11:16.644 --> 11:19.178
but we're just having
fun. You know what?

11:19.180 --> 11:22.448
It is so nice to be with
a girl who's not constantly

11:22.450 --> 11:25.685
analyzing things and
wanting to DTR and stuff.

11:25.687 --> 11:30.389
Yeah. Sully seems
more like the DTF type.

11:30.391 --> 11:31.852
For sure.

11:37.398 --> 11:38.998
The coolest thing about her, though,

11:39.000 --> 11:40.533
is underneath all her bro-ishness,

11:40.535 --> 11:42.969
I mean, she actually
has a romantic side.

11:42.971 --> 11:44.369
Yo, McKibben!

11:44.939 --> 11:46.272
Oh!

11:46.274 --> 11:48.407
You're a baller!

11:48.409 --> 11:51.477
Yeah, super romantic.

11:52.148 --> 11:53.579
Ooh.

11:53.581 --> 11:56.282
<i>I'd come full of optimism,
but the club was empty.</i>

11:56.284 --> 11:58.684
<i>Tonight was supposed to be
about reviving old friendships</i>

11:58.686 --> 12:00.753
<i>and making new ones
with my coworkers,</i>

12:00.755 --> 12:03.552
<i>but it looked like all my
coworkers had ditched me.</i>

12:04.125 --> 12:06.425
<i>Except for Luke.</i>

12:07.828 --> 12:09.629
Thought you had a maybe date.

12:09.631 --> 12:11.912
Yeah, well, I knew
you were gonna show up

12:11.937 --> 12:13.570
to this awful club on
time and everyone else

12:13.595 --> 12:16.544
is gonna be an hour
late, so I canceled it.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.264
I hated to think of you sitting alone,

12:18.266 --> 12:21.505
especially when the only
other person here is that dude.

12:21.530 --> 12:24.178
<i>I had been trying to ignore
how much I liked Luke,</i>

12:24.203 --> 12:26.937
<i>but now it was just
impossible to deny.</i>

12:26.939 --> 12:28.706
<i>Luke was a truly great guy.</i>

12:28.708 --> 12:31.542
<i>Not to mention looking
hotter than ever.</i>

12:31.544 --> 12:33.677
So are Ethan and Ophelia coming?

12:33.679 --> 12:36.046
Ethan texted me saying that
Ophelia invited him over

12:36.048 --> 12:38.149
to her place for mojitos and massage,

12:38.151 --> 12:39.617
and Ophelia texted saying

12:39.619 --> 12:41.252
she was gonna try to hook up with Ethan,

12:41.254 --> 12:44.866
but I'm pretty sure that
meant hang out, not hook up.

12:44.891 --> 12:47.329
- Right?
- No, I think she meant hook up.

12:48.463 --> 12:51.962
I know it's dumb, but I really
want them to think I'm cool.

12:51.964 --> 12:54.732
I mean, that's probably why
they didn't come tonight,

12:54.734 --> 12:56.892
because they think I'm
an unsuccessful loser.

12:56.917 --> 12:58.517
Are you kidding me?

12:58.671 --> 13:00.738
They didn't show up
'cause they're flakes.

13:00.740 --> 13:02.673
You're cooler than
both of them combined.

13:02.675 --> 13:07.378
So can I buy you a $20 gin and tonic?

13:07.380 --> 13:10.514
How 'bout a $15 beer? I'm a cheap date.

13:13.686 --> 13:15.181
Ooh.

13:15.206 --> 13:18.260
What do I have to yank
to get a beer around here?

13:19.158 --> 13:21.120
This guy.

13:21.761 --> 13:23.394
At these prices, I can see why someone

13:23.396 --> 13:25.129
would turn to prostitution for a drink.

13:27.033 --> 13:28.267
It's natural.

13:31.837 --> 13:34.071
This is where the party's at.

13:34.073 --> 13:35.478
Kill me now.

13:37.000 --> 13:43.074

13:47.220 --> 13:48.886
Hey, I need a marg.

13:48.888 --> 13:51.021
And the bartender's
phone number. Waiter!

13:51.023 --> 13:52.790
I don't work here, psycho!

13:55.861 --> 13:57.420
Okay, one drink.

13:58.502 --> 14:00.030
Marg with salt!

14:00.517 --> 14:01.865
I know.

14:09.108 --> 14:10.813
Oh!

14:10.838 --> 14:13.744
This is pure ginger ale.
There's no booze in it.

14:13.746 --> 14:17.081
Gotcha! Ha-ha! Even.

14:17.083 --> 14:18.682
- Even.
- Okay.

14:18.684 --> 14:20.784
- Definitely.
- We're done.

14:20.786 --> 14:22.987
- Uh-huh, totally. Yes.
- Okay, thank God.

14:24.724 --> 14:26.690
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Well, well, well.

14:26.692 --> 14:29.326
Looks like Sergio showed. Told you.

14:29.328 --> 14:30.536
Touché.

14:33.532 --> 14:36.100
- I knew you'd come.
- Really?

14:36.102 --> 14:37.845
- Did you sit in sugar?
- What?

14:37.870 --> 14:39.336
'Cause you have a sweet ass.

14:39.338 --> 14:41.972
Ugh. Save it.

14:43.376 --> 14:45.214
Two shots of tequila.

14:46.345 --> 14:49.203
Hi. Do you two know each other?

14:49.228 --> 14:52.850
- Sadie, are you okay?
- Not now, Lissa. I'm busy.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.164
You're sending me a
lot of mixed messages.

15:07.166 --> 15:08.487
Shut up.

15:14.140 --> 15:15.239
Whoo.

15:20.313 --> 15:22.212
I'm gonna head to the bathroom.

15:22.214 --> 15:24.481
Why don't you go hang out with Tamara?

15:24.483 --> 15:26.050
I think I will.

15:26.052 --> 15:28.352
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

15:30.908 --> 15:33.290
<i>Finally, to do what
I came here for.</i>

15:33.292 --> 15:35.426
<i>No, not to tip a
bathroom attendant $5</i>

15:35.428 --> 15:37.110
<i>for handing me a paper towel;</i>

15:37.135 --> 15:39.637
<i>to spend time with
my best friend.</i>

15:42.568 --> 15:44.635
Happy birthday, ho.

15:44.637 --> 15:47.037
T, you're the best.

15:47.039 --> 15:50.422
Wow. Bottle service. Isn't
that really expensive?

15:50.447 --> 15:51.675
Who's paying for this?

15:51.677 --> 15:53.992
Oh, don't worry. They'll
pay. Boys always pay,

15:54.017 --> 15:55.479
especially when it's a girl's birthday.

15:57.116 --> 15:59.016
Whatever ended up happening
with that guy in New York?

15:59.018 --> 16:01.685
Uh, Jenna, sorry, I
have to put in the time

16:01.687 --> 16:03.420
if Bachelor Number One
and Bachelor Number Two

16:03.422 --> 16:06.623
are gonna pick up the tab, so
can we have this convo later?

16:07.408 --> 16:09.493
Yeah, in like five minutes?

16:09.495 --> 16:10.803
Like five hours.

16:11.931 --> 16:15.099
Sure thing. I'll leave you guys alone.

16:15.101 --> 16:17.901
<i>Had Tamara changed so
much since high school?</i>

16:17.903 --> 16:20.149
<i>Had I? Maybe I just had to accept</i>

16:20.174 --> 16:22.774
<i>that we'd both gone too far
in different directions.</i>

16:22.776 --> 16:25.565
<i>I felt like I didn't know
who my friends were anymore.</i>

16:26.025 --> 16:28.108
<i>Well, I did know one.</i>

16:44.698 --> 16:46.265
Cheers.

16:47.025 --> 16:49.095
_

16:55.543 --> 16:57.676
- Yeah.
- You should go after her.

16:57.678 --> 16:59.144
I don't know.

16:59.146 --> 17:01.049
Come on. She's obviously upset.

17:01.074 --> 17:02.541
She needs her best friend.

17:02.566 --> 17:05.243
But I don't think she is
my best friend anymore.

17:05.276 --> 17:07.041
Well, then go get her back.

17:23.627 --> 17:26.429
Hey, that guy just grabbed my ass.

17:28.465 --> 17:29.965
Is that how you treat a lady?

17:29.967 --> 17:32.217
Lady? Sully?

17:33.337 --> 17:34.403
No, no, no, no.

17:34.405 --> 17:35.438
She-she-she's just kidding.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.072
It's just this thing we do.

17:37.074 --> 17:39.875
Seriously, Sully, just tell this
gentleman that you were joking.

17:39.877 --> 17:41.143
- Joking.
- How do you know her name?

17:41.145 --> 17:42.502
What are you, a stalker?

17:42.527 --> 17:44.447
Whoa, whoa. Let's just...
why don't we calm it down?

17:46.951 --> 17:49.552
Hey, why don't you relax, bro?

17:51.956 --> 17:54.115
I'm not your bro, bro.

18:00.531 --> 18:02.164
Sully, what the hell?

18:02.166 --> 18:03.599
Dude, I just saved your life.

18:03.601 --> 18:05.134
- You're out here.
- Yeah, I'm going.

18:05.136 --> 18:07.369
My champers! Sully!

18:09.474 --> 18:12.408
Good night, Roundelay! Whoo!

18:13.778 --> 18:15.411
Do you want to go after Matty?

18:15.413 --> 18:16.679
See if he's okay?

18:16.681 --> 18:17.775
<i>There was no part of me</i>

18:17.800 --> 18:19.615
<i>that wanted to follow
Matty McKibben.</i>

18:19.617 --> 18:20.806
<i>For the first time,</i>

18:20.831 --> 18:22.525
<i>I didn't feel anything for him...</i>

18:22.557 --> 18:25.258
<i>not love, not hate,
just indifference.</i>

18:25.260 --> 18:29.195
No, I don't. Want to get out of here?

18:29.197 --> 18:30.563
Absolutely.

18:44.895 --> 18:46.461
Your card was declined.

18:46.463 --> 18:47.963
The guys didn't pay for it?

18:47.965 --> 18:50.031
What guys? I ran your
card. It was declined.

18:50.033 --> 18:51.933
And you're not going
anywhere until you pay me.

18:51.935 --> 18:53.153
But I can't.

18:53.178 --> 18:55.637
Oh, I just wanted Sadie
to have a nice birthday.

18:55.661 --> 18:56.893
Do I need to call my manager?

18:56.895 --> 18:58.728
No. No, no, no, no, no, no. No.

18:58.730 --> 19:00.597
Here. Try this one.

19:13.372 --> 19:15.339
He doesn't deserve you.

19:19.478 --> 19:21.512
Party's over. Time to go.

19:26.497 --> 19:27.963
<i>This was my second all-nighter</i>

19:27.965 --> 19:29.309
<i>with Luke this week.</i>

19:29.334 --> 19:31.699
<i>The first one was great,
but tonight felt special.</i>

19:31.724 --> 19:33.257
<i>And no one even got naked.</i>

19:33.259 --> 19:35.726
I wonder if Ophelia
managed to seduce Ethan?

19:35.728 --> 19:37.361
God, I hope I never find out.

19:38.597 --> 19:40.130
Hey...

19:41.934 --> 19:44.034
When I said I didn't want to date,

19:44.036 --> 19:45.702
why did you agree so quickly?

19:45.704 --> 19:47.304
What was I supposed to do, beg you?

19:47.306 --> 19:51.275
No, but you just... jumped at the idea.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.309
I respect that you
want to do well at work.

19:53.713 --> 19:55.504
I don't want to make
you feel bad about it,

19:55.871 --> 19:57.611
but that said, I mean...

19:58.817 --> 20:01.518
if you want to try again...

20:03.497 --> 20:04.886
I would be up for that.

20:04.911 --> 20:07.815
<i>I had been trying so hard
to avoid drama with Luke</i>

20:07.840 --> 20:10.527
<i>that I hadn't realized I
was the one causing it.</i>

20:10.552 --> 20:13.886
<i>Things ended badly with Luke
because I ran off after Matty.</i>

20:13.888 --> 20:16.622
<i>But dating Luke when I was
no longer hung up on Matty,</i>

20:16.623 --> 20:18.997
<i>that'd be like dating
him for the first time.</i>

20:19.022 --> 20:21.591
