<i>They say you should
never give up on your dreams,</i>

01:01.024 --> 01:02.567
<i>but what if you should?</i>

01:04.152 --> 01:08.073
<i>What if your dreams are just
too big and you are too small?</i>

01:08.865 --> 01:15.622
<i>A tiny, insignificant speck of carbon
floating in a cruel, unforgiving universe.</i>

01:17.582 --> 01:22.045
<i>No, the universe doesn't
care about your dreams.</i>

01:23.004 --> 01:25.924
<i>In a flash of light,
in the blink of an eye,</i>

01:26.007 --> 01:28.635
<i>it will wipe its ass with your destiny.</i>

01:30.220 --> 01:32.764
<i>But if you learn to accept this,</i>

01:32.847 --> 01:36.142
<i>to laugh at God
instead of cursing him,</i>

01:36.518 --> 01:40.146
<i>then maybe, just maybe,
you stand a chance</i>

01:40.230 --> 01:44.442
<i>of becoming a pretty decent clown.</i>

01:46.361 --> 01:47.362
Weird.

01:49.656 --> 01:50.782
Where is everybody?

01:58.873 --> 02:02.043
<i>♪ If you're happy and you know it,

02:03.253 --> 02:06.381

02:17.350 --> 02:20.478
If you're happy-- bear with me--
and you know it, stamp your...

02:23.064 --> 02:25.692
Ah, you know it don't you?

02:26.860 --> 02:29.195
Are you going to be
able to finish that? Or...

02:29.279 --> 02:31.573
What is it? Red Leicester?
What is that?

02:31.656 --> 02:32.657
Bobo!

02:33.491 --> 02:36.619
I thought we were clear.
We're gonna go another way with this.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.248
Yes, I heard you.
You said I was depressing the children.

02:40.331 --> 02:42.375
That's why I brought out
the happy dance.

02:42.458 --> 02:46.004
Look, we've had a great run, but we're
gonna give Nathan a go this time.

02:46.087 --> 02:48.965
- He does close-up magic...
- And far-away magic.

02:51.092 --> 02:52.635
A fucking wand-stroker?!

02:54.178 --> 02:55.722
My act works!

02:56.389 --> 02:59.851
I've been doing it 25 years!
It's the kids that've changed!

02:59.934 --> 03:02.020
They don't appreciate
the classics anymore.

03:02.103 --> 03:04.230
They just wanna get
jacked up on energy drinks,

03:04.314 --> 03:05.815
and watch Serbian pornography.

03:05.899 --> 03:10.278
- I don't think these kids are watching--
- Asian shit, foot stuff, whatever.

03:11.154 --> 03:14.240
If you want to give my job to a
fucking hat fister, then fine.

03:14.699 --> 03:15.700
Fuck you.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.494
And fuck him,
and fuck this gig,

03:18.578 --> 03:20.622
and fuck all these joyless little pricks,

03:20.705 --> 03:22.749
because I quit. Okay?

03:22.832 --> 03:26.252
Oh, I'll be taking one of these
jellies as well. Thank you!

03:28.171 --> 03:29.297
That was methadone.

03:32.425 --> 03:33.468
Yeah, I knew that.

03:34.427 --> 03:35.762
Alright?

03:45.480 --> 03:47.273
Right.
Let's introduce you.

03:48.942 --> 03:50.860

<i>Good morning, Ireland.</i>

03:50.944 --> 03:54.530
<i>You're listening to 93.5 with Big Roy

03:54.614 --> 03:57.617

<i>Extreme weather conditions in Bolivia</i>

03:57.700 --> 04:00.703

04:23.017 --> 04:24.102
Hey, kid.

04:24.185 --> 04:27.397
Do you wanna see a show?
Come on.

04:27.480 --> 04:31.150
- It'll only take a second.
- Hey! Let go!

04:31.234 --> 04:34.779
Help! That thing was trying
to drag my son away!

04:35.488 --> 04:38.199
No, no, no.

04:38.283 --> 04:41.703
That's just where I do my show.
They won't let me do it out here.

04:41.786 --> 04:43.621
If you need any witnesses,
I saw what happened.

04:43.705 --> 04:45.581
She definitely tried to snatch your kid.

04:45.665 --> 04:48.710
Fuck you, Alan!
Just gimme a shot on the strip.

04:48.793 --> 04:51.796
- I've done my time!
- The strip's for artists, Funzo.

04:51.879 --> 04:53.881
You're scaring away the clients.

04:55.008 --> 04:58.553
You want to dance with me,
Alan, do you wanna dance?

04:59.220 --> 05:01.347
Is this clown bothering you, Alan?

05:03.474 --> 05:04.517
Okay.

05:05.310 --> 05:06.311
Okay.

05:14.944 --> 05:19.407
You can run, Funzo but we'll get
you eventually! We can wait!

05:19.490 --> 05:22.577
Human statues can always wait!

05:23.119 --> 05:25.079
-

05:29.709 --> 05:34.172
<i>Before we begin, there are
three basic truths you must accept.</i>

05:34.672 --> 05:36.716
One, God is dead.

05:37.884 --> 05:39.052
Two.

05:39.135 --> 05:42.889
Laughter is the only sane response
to a meaningless existence.

05:44.265 --> 05:47.935
Three, if you are going to do a tumble,

05:49.228 --> 05:52.190
make sure you land
on the meat of your buttocks,

05:53.066 --> 05:55.401
or you will really damage your ass bone.

05:57.862 --> 06:00.323
You, why are you here?

06:01.824 --> 06:03.284
I just love kids.

06:03.409 --> 06:05.912
I guess... making them laugh.

06:05.995 --> 06:09.165
A bit route one, isn't it?
"Making children laugh."

06:09.248 --> 06:13.252
Ah, we have an avant-gardist in our midst.

06:14.087 --> 06:16.964
Let us marvel at his singular genius.

06:20.593 --> 06:22.053
Monsieur DuCoque.

06:22.136 --> 06:28.893
I am Pepe, and this is my interpretation
of the classic mime "Trapped In A Box."

06:38.277 --> 06:39.278
That's a wall.

06:44.450 --> 06:46.994
And another one. Not this again.

06:47.495 --> 06:50.873
Ooh, uh, Julian.
Julian, are you still out there?

06:52.125 --> 06:53.584
I better call Barbara.

06:54.377 --> 06:56.295
Hello? May I speak to Barbara please?

06:56.379 --> 06:58.214
Barbara? Hi, it's Pepe.

06:58.297 --> 07:00.508
Listen, bit of an embarrassing one
for you, Barbara.

07:00.591 --> 07:01.926
You know that box I've got

07:02.009 --> 07:03.678
- at the end of my garden?
- Enough!

07:04.637 --> 07:07.348
This is the worst performance
I have ever seen.

07:07.431 --> 07:09.142
Sorry, maybe you
didn't understand there.

07:09.225 --> 07:12.061
I wasn't actually trapped in a box.
I was just pretending.

07:12.145 --> 07:14.814
A true clown never pretends.

07:14.897 --> 07:16.441
He simply be's.

07:17.108 --> 07:20.319
But I am a true clown.
I just need some training.

07:20.611 --> 07:25.116
If I taught a duck to wear a hat and
a little suit and go to an office

07:25.199 --> 07:30.329
every day with a tiny briefcase,
would that make him a businessman?

07:30.872 --> 07:33.833
Well, if he tried really hard
and read all the books and...

07:33.916 --> 07:35.877
really believed in his
dreams, then yes!

07:35.960 --> 07:38.337
Yes, I know that duck
could become a businessman.

07:38.421 --> 07:39.547
<i>Silence!</i>

07:39.630 --> 07:45.052
You will never... be...
a true clown.

07:47.263 --> 07:48.473
Monsieur DuCoque!

07:50.349 --> 07:51.517
Monsieur DuCoque!

07:52.226 --> 07:55.396
They say comedy equals tragedy plus time.

07:55.688 --> 07:59.275
Well, unfortunately, time was up
for the man that some people called

07:59.358 --> 08:02.570
<i>the last great clown, Jean DuCoque.</i>

08:02.653 --> 08:06.574
And joining me to discuss
his legacy is, well, a bit of a blast

08:06.657 --> 08:09.410
from the TV past,
The amazing Alphonso.

08:09.494 --> 08:11.746
It's "The Great,"
it's "The Great Alphonso."

08:11.829 --> 08:15.458
So DuCoque was, I suppose, some
kind of a hero to you.

08:16.959 --> 08:19.170
<i>Indeed. And I to him.</i>

08:19.253 --> 08:21.005
<i>Unlike many of the other so-called</i>

08:21.088 --> 08:25.259
<i>"stars of the time,"
he was not a jealous clown.</i>

08:25.551 --> 08:29.889
<i>For instance, when Alphonso's
Fun Club became the nation's highest</i>

08:29.972 --> 08:32.642
rated kids' TV show in 1993...

08:32.725 --> 08:35.144
I think I remember that show!

08:35.478 --> 08:38.856
- And then again, in 1994.
- Wasn't it canceled due to some kind

08:38.940 --> 08:41.317
of a freak gunge tank accident?

08:41.400 --> 08:42.360
Yeah, it was.

08:42.443 --> 08:44.737
There were no formal charges.

08:44.820 --> 08:47.448
- Piss off.
<i>- I think DuCoque would be delighted</i>

08:47.532 --> 08:49.408
to hear the announcement
of my comeback show

08:49.492 --> 08:51.869
this Saturday at the
National Concert Hall--

08:51.953 --> 08:55.540
Saturday? Isn't that the same night as
Garth Brooks' Stadium show?

08:55.623 --> 08:57.208
'Cause that's where I'll be!

08:57.375 --> 08:58.584
Oh, fucking hack.

09:01.921 --> 09:03.256
Why are you watching this?

09:09.303 --> 09:11.430
Fuck off!

09:11.514 --> 09:14.225
Fucking thing. Piss off!

09:15.101 --> 09:18.729
Piss off. Why are you smiling?
You've got nothing to smile for.

09:18.813 --> 09:19.814
Eat cock.

09:20.565 --> 09:24.277
Why are you smiling?!

09:24.986 --> 09:26.112
Piece of shit.

10:11.032 --> 10:12.491
I need that source, Suzie.

10:12.575 --> 10:14.744
I'm not going live
without a second source.

10:14.827 --> 10:16.912
No, no. I never said
it was off the record!

10:16.996 --> 10:19.540
- He's not gonna wrap up this story.

10:19.624 --> 10:20.750
You've got 20 minutes.

10:23.628 --> 10:25.963
Wow. It only took you three days.

10:26.047 --> 10:27.798
You know you get paid by the word?

10:27.882 --> 10:30.885
Look, Edith, I think I've
got a real story here.

10:31.344 --> 10:35.389
- What do you know about solar flares?
- I know I don't care about them.

10:35.473 --> 10:38.267
I've been tracking some serious
meteorological anomalies

10:38.351 --> 10:39.685
over the past few months.

10:39.769 --> 10:45.483
NASA, the European Space Agency, the SWPC,
all warning of a potentially major event.

10:45.566 --> 10:48.694
- Alright, listen, Jenny...
- I know what you're gonna say, Edith,

10:48.778 --> 10:50.363
but journalism is in my blood.

10:50.446 --> 10:52.323
You've got a thoroughbred horse here,

10:52.406 --> 10:54.742
and you've got me giving
pony rides round the garden.

10:54.825 --> 10:57.495
I can sleep standing up.
I can shit while I gallop.

10:57.578 --> 11:00.331
Stop wasting me on these
bullshit celebrity puff pieces.

11:00.414 --> 11:02.375
And let me feel the wind in my mane.

11:02.875 --> 11:06.295
All right. As it happens,
I do have a story for you.

11:06.379 --> 11:09.840
Out in the field, something
tailored to your particular expertise.

11:11.258 --> 11:13.594
A clown funeral.

11:13.677 --> 11:15.846
A clown funeral!

11:15.930 --> 11:19.183
How fucked up is that? Who
wouldn't click through?

11:19.266 --> 11:22.228
But I thought you wanted
me for my expertise.

11:22.603 --> 11:23.604
I do.

11:24.313 --> 11:26.023
Didn't you fuck a clown?

11:27.233 --> 11:28.859
Sorry, did I get that wrong?

11:30.528 --> 11:34.782
Jenny Malone fucked a clown, right?

11:35.491 --> 11:36.742
This Jenny?

11:37.034 --> 11:39.787
- She fucked a clown?
- Yes, she's the clown fucker.

11:39.870 --> 11:42.039
Can we all stop calling me that please?

11:42.289 --> 11:44.250
I just hooked up with a guy at a party.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.293
Was it a children's party?

11:46.377 --> 11:48.629
Ah, fuck you, Suzie.
Journalists are talking.

11:48.712 --> 11:52.299
Look, no one else here knows
a goddamn thing about clowns.

11:52.466 --> 11:54.218
So do you want this job or not?

12:02.685 --> 12:03.853
I'll do it.

12:04.770 --> 12:08.023
Some day I'm gonna do
some real reporting,

12:08.107 --> 12:10.234
and I'm gonna show you...

12:12.611 --> 12:14.280
you judgmental bitch.

12:15.489 --> 12:18.367
Are you talking to me
or your dead mother?

12:20.369 --> 12:23.205
- Dead mother.
- Cool. That's totally normal.

12:34.216 --> 12:38.304
<i>Heavy winds being
blamed for the unusual network blackouts</i>

12:38.387 --> 12:42.308
<i>from the Cavernly triangle, and also
fearing increasing levels of disruption,</i>

12:42.391 --> 12:45.019
<i>and a sharp rise in the number
of towns shutting down.</i>

12:57.781 --> 13:00.034
- Can I help you?
- Is Jenny here?

13:00.576 --> 13:02.870
- Jenny.
- Yeah. Five foot four.

13:03.496 --> 13:04.497
Medium hair.

13:06.165 --> 13:08.334
The most beautiful woman in the world.

13:09.543 --> 13:13.631
We do have a Jenny,
but she's kind of plain.

13:13.714 --> 13:15.883
I can take a message.

13:16.300 --> 13:17.301
Um...

13:19.470 --> 13:20.596
could you tell her...

13:20.679 --> 13:25.601
every time I see a sunset
the wind shouts her name.

13:26.685 --> 13:29.355
Jenny!

13:30.105 --> 13:32.566
Don't say that actually. It's weird, no?

13:33.400 --> 13:36.111
I still wrote it...
Could you just say "What up?"

13:36.403 --> 13:37.446
"What up?"

13:37.905 --> 13:39.615
You just want me
to say "What up?"

13:39.698 --> 13:41.659
Yeah, but keep it--
keep it casual,

13:41.742 --> 13:43.661
like you're really busy,
it's no big deal,

13:43.744 --> 13:45.037
so "What up? What up?"

13:45.120 --> 13:47.915
Not like that, but "What up"
like that. Keep it mean.

13:47.998 --> 13:50.251
Okay. Uh, what was your name?

13:51.669 --> 13:52.670
Uh, Bobo.

13:53.254 --> 13:56.674
Bobo as in Bobo the Clown.

13:56.757 --> 13:58.717
Wow.

13:59.051 --> 14:01.428
You know, I don't know
where she is right now,

14:01.512 --> 14:06.725
uh, but I can tell you
where she'll be tomorrow morning.

14:08.227 --> 14:09.270
Please.

14:20.781 --> 14:23.826
-

14:36.046 --> 14:37.590
Thanks for the ride!

14:55.524 --> 14:57.401
- Jenny.
- Oh, fuck me.

14:57.776 --> 14:59.653
Wow, baby girl.

15:00.154 --> 15:02.781
- Of course you're here.
- Wow, you look spectacular.

15:02.865 --> 15:04.199
What are the chances?

15:08.287 --> 15:09.580
Yeah, so I'm good.

15:10.789 --> 15:14.168
Finally got out of the clown game.
At last. Long time coming.

15:15.002 --> 15:19.590
Nah. I just needed a change, you know.
Been reading a lot of fitness magazines.

15:21.592 --> 15:22.801
Hey, how you doing?

15:22.927 --> 15:24.637
Bobo. Nice to meet you.

15:25.596 --> 15:28.432
- So are you a couple or what's the coup?
- What? No!

15:28.515 --> 15:30.643
- Oh, sorry. You seem lovely.
- What, are you single?

15:30.726 --> 15:32.227
- Um...
- We should go out some time.

15:32.311 --> 15:35.439
I know this great little Italian!
And he's a fantastic hot dog stand.

15:35.522 --> 15:38.067
Bobo. I'm working.
Leave me alone.

15:40.277 --> 15:41.278
Nice.

15:42.237 --> 15:45.866
Sorry to cock-block you there, mate.
But me and her got history.

15:47.034 --> 15:49.244
And a future by the looks of it, so...

15:50.871 --> 15:55.459
You can flash all the cash you want, but
you ain't impressing anyone, mate. Okay?

16:05.719 --> 16:08.097
So anyway he says,
"What's with the big pants?"

16:08.430 --> 16:09.515
And then I say,

16:09.598 --> 16:12.434
"that's where I keep the big dick
I use to fuck your mum."

16:12.935 --> 16:16.188
Anyway, that's why I don't play
orphanages anymore.

16:24.905 --> 16:26.490
I'm so sorry for your loss.

16:27.408 --> 16:29.201
Oh, thank you.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.830
Monsieur DuCoque
was like a father to me.

16:32.913 --> 16:38.627
I suppose now it's fallen
upon me to honor his legacy.

16:40.754 --> 16:42.756
Big shoes to fill.

16:46.552 --> 16:47.553
You're right.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.764
I should take his shoes.

16:51.640 --> 16:52.641
Fuck me.

16:52.725 --> 16:57.146
So this guy, he must have
been a pretty big deal, right?

16:57.229 --> 16:58.981
- Who, DuCoque?
- Mm-hmm.

16:59.398 --> 17:03.318
Yeah. I guess. Excuse me.

17:04.403 --> 17:06.572
Aah. You smell musky.

17:10.993 --> 17:12.286
Jen!

17:12.369 --> 17:14.580
Wow! This is a real Who's Who, huh?

17:14.997 --> 17:16.331
Hey. How you doing?

17:18.751 --> 17:19.877
Friends.

17:21.378 --> 17:24.423
The pain and grief we are all feeling.

17:24.506 --> 17:26.300
There are no words.

17:27.259 --> 17:30.387
But where words fail us,

17:30.471 --> 17:32.806
there is always mime!

17:43.275 --> 17:44.610
What're we lookin' at?

17:44.693 --> 17:46.570
I'm trapped in a box while screaming.

17:48.155 --> 17:49.531
That's not how it reads.

17:54.703 --> 17:56.580
Okay, the other hand isn't helping.

18:08.634 --> 18:10.803
A fitting tribute, I think we'd all agree.

18:12.429 --> 18:16.850
But first, let me tell you
how great it is

18:17.267 --> 18:21.980
to see the nation's entire clowning
community in such rude health.

18:24.775 --> 18:27.069
<i>Adieu Monsieur.</i>

18:27.152 --> 18:28.862
But enough about the past.

18:29.988 --> 18:32.032
As you all know,

18:32.116 --> 18:35.536
I myself am back on top,

18:35.661 --> 18:40.582
gearing up for my enormous
comeback show tomorrow night!

18:40.958 --> 18:42.793
But I need a support act.

18:43.210 --> 18:45.671
- Well, if you...
- Not you. Not that.

18:46.588 --> 18:48.382
Wait a minute, where's Boinki?

18:48.465 --> 18:49.633
Doing a Masters.

18:49.716 --> 18:50.801
Hmm?

18:51.051 --> 18:53.011
- Giggles?
- Trampled by a horse.

18:53.345 --> 18:54.972
Oh, probably for the best.

18:55.806 --> 18:57.474
Um, what about you?

18:57.808 --> 18:58.934
Are you a clown?

18:59.017 --> 19:00.936
I mean, the makeup says clown,

19:01.019 --> 19:02.938
- but the hair--
- I'm a journalist.

19:03.147 --> 19:05.107
- Thank you very much.
- Well, perfect.

19:05.190 --> 19:07.359
I'll give you 20 minutes after this.

19:07.901 --> 19:09.778
Then we can do the interview, eh?

19:11.822 --> 19:13.699
Right. Well then, we'll have to audition!

19:13.782 --> 19:16.827
Everyone out to the car park.
I'll give you five minutes each.

19:16.910 --> 19:19.163
Glory awaits!

19:21.623 --> 19:24.126
We just want Funzo.

19:24.209 --> 19:28.046
If you want me, you're
gonna have to take on all of us.

19:28.130 --> 19:30.757
You fucked up now, Alan.

19:30.841 --> 19:32.843
Right, guys?

19:34.011 --> 19:36.263
- Who are you?
- Who's Alan?

19:36.889 --> 19:39.057
You owe me an ear, Funzo.

19:39.516 --> 19:40.893
You take Liberty.

19:40.976 --> 19:42.811
Leave Alan to me.

19:44.646 --> 19:45.731
Take them where?

19:46.732 --> 19:48.692
To Hell.

19:50.152 --> 19:51.153
Oh my God!

19:57.034 --> 20:00.412
You can't do this to me!
My comeback show is tomorrow!

20:00.537 --> 20:02.581
Ticket sales have been robust.

20:02.664 --> 20:03.832
Weird fuckers, come on!

20:03.916 --> 20:05.542
This is a violation of
my journalistic rights.

20:05.626 --> 20:08.045
You might as well curl off a hot one
right on the Geneva Convention.

20:08.212 --> 20:11.131
- Come on to fuck your...
- I want to be in her cell.

20:11.924 --> 20:13.634
I want to be in that cell.

20:26.855 --> 20:29.775
- Was that a tooth?
- Yeah, but it's not mine.

20:35.822 --> 20:39.326
Do you think maybe she's gone scary?

20:39.785 --> 20:43.580
So. What should we call our
clown troupe slash fight club?

20:44.206 --> 20:47.793
- I'm not a clown
- And I am not forming a troupe with you.

20:49.211 --> 20:51.588
I trained under the late Jean DuCoque.

20:51.713 --> 20:53.882
You look like a tramp
who lost at paintball.

20:54.091 --> 20:56.468
- I'm a street clown.
- Street clown?

20:56.551 --> 20:58.679
What is that?
That doesn't even mean anything.

20:58.762 --> 21:03.016
It means I learned my
shit on the streets.

21:03.267 --> 21:05.686
Not some fancy school with a roof on it.

21:05.978 --> 21:09.982
It means a clown for anyone,
any place, any time.

21:10.065 --> 21:14.528
Down an alley, under a bridge,
outside people's windows at night.

21:14.736 --> 21:16.446
I'll clown for you right now.

21:18.323 --> 21:19.783
Without so much as a warmup!

21:19.866 --> 21:21.827
Are you insane?

21:22.077 --> 21:24.830
What?
Never seen a neck trapeze before?

21:24.913 --> 21:27.541
- Oh, well that answers that.
- What did you say, DuCoque muncher?

21:27.624 --> 21:31.461
- You heard what I said you little lunatic!
- Just stop it, you poke at my face!

21:31.545 --> 21:34.673
Why don't you shut up, both of you?!

21:36.508 --> 21:39.303
This whole argument is pointless.

21:39.970 --> 21:42.973
Face it, the world doesn't
need clowns anymore.

21:44.016 --> 21:47.978
We're fax machines, we're travel agents.

21:49.563 --> 21:51.023
We're obsolete.

22:50.749 --> 22:51.792
What's that noise?

22:56.129 --> 22:57.297
Fucking hell!

23:03.553 --> 23:06.264
Funzo? What have you done?
Let them out please.

23:06.348 --> 23:09.476
We could, but then we'd also
be letting out all the rats.

23:09.559 --> 23:10.435
What rats?

23:10.519 --> 23:13.980
- The sack of rats I threw in there.
- We're gonna get you Funzo!

23:14.064 --> 23:16.066
You better sleep with one eye open!

23:16.149 --> 23:20.070
- It's cool. I already do.
- You'll never outrun us, Funzo.

23:20.153 --> 23:22.781
You can't escape. Oh my God,
there's one on my balls.

23:22.864 --> 23:24.116
There's one on my balls.

23:29.079 --> 23:31.998
Weird.
Where is everybody?

23:39.631 --> 23:41.550
Hello?

23:43.635 --> 23:46.054
Anybody!

23:55.522 --> 23:57.983
- My phone's dead.
- So's my beeper.

23:58.066 --> 23:59.609
So are my parents.

24:00.527 --> 24:02.612
But I had nothing to do with it.

24:07.659 --> 24:11.872
So when that thing comes back to life,
how about you give me your number?

24:11.955 --> 24:14.166
And we go for that fantastic hot dog.

24:14.624 --> 24:16.626
Bobo, there's not gonna be a hot dog.

24:18.044 --> 24:21.548
Oh, so you wanna get right down to it
like last time, do you?

24:22.007 --> 24:23.466
Last time was a mistake.

24:25.343 --> 24:29.347
A sweaty, sweaty mistake,
and I've regretted it ever since.

24:35.896 --> 24:37.272
Monsieur is still in there!

24:37.856 --> 24:39.274
How could they leave him?

24:39.357 --> 24:42.402
Trapped in a box, the irony!

24:45.030 --> 24:47.616
Damn it, the Scimitar
won't let me enter her.

24:48.325 --> 24:51.161
You! Journalist!
I've got a show to do!

24:51.244 --> 24:53.580
So I'm gonna have to
drive you in your car.

24:53.914 --> 24:56.708
I can give you that interview
you were asking for.

24:57.209 --> 24:59.002
Nothing electrical is working.

24:59.085 --> 25:01.213
Oh shit, really?

25:09.512 --> 25:12.265
What do you say, friend,
can you give us a lift?

25:12.807 --> 25:16.519
There is no way I'm giving a lift
to a talentless has-been,

25:17.354 --> 25:19.272
a homeless psychopath,

25:19.356 --> 25:23.401
and the woman
who broke my heart!

25:24.319 --> 25:26.738
Look, I've got a big show tonight

25:26.821 --> 25:28.698
and there's a juicy support slot,

25:28.782 --> 25:32.160
which I'm willing to dangle over
the muzzle of any slobbering clown

25:32.244 --> 25:35.580
- willing to do me a solid.
- I can do you a solid.

25:35.664 --> 25:38.625
How solid do you need?

25:38.959 --> 25:40.585
You know we've met before, right?

25:41.211 --> 25:44.631
We both came over here
to audition for the same TV show,

25:44.714 --> 25:47.509
and I spent every penny
I had on that ferry.

25:48.176 --> 25:50.637
And he saw me rehearse
backstage and stole my act.

25:51.221 --> 25:53.473
And the career.
It should have been mine.

25:53.765 --> 25:55.225
Oh, what we got here?

25:55.392 --> 25:56.893
Oh look, it's your whole act.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.272
Look, Boo Boo is it?

26:01.273 --> 26:05.235
Have you any idea how many lesser
clowns have accused me of stealing

26:05.318 --> 26:07.487
their shitty material over the years?

26:08.405 --> 26:12.200
It's not my fault you couldn't
make it on the big boy stage,

26:12.659 --> 26:15.829
but if you did want to make
a genuine contribution

26:15.912 --> 26:18.081
to our illustrious art form,

26:18.164 --> 26:20.667
then the best thing you can do

26:20.750 --> 26:25.964
is drive me to Dublin
so that I can do my show.

26:26.339 --> 26:27.424
Fuck the art form.

26:28.133 --> 26:32.429
Clowning is as dead to me as that boy
band who drowned in your gunge tank.

26:32.512 --> 26:36.016
There was only one of them.
There were no formal charges.

26:36.474 --> 26:37.517
Bobo.

26:37.809 --> 26:39.602
- Bobo.
- What?

26:40.186 --> 26:44.316
I'm sorry about what I said back there.
I don't actually want you to die.

26:45.817 --> 26:48.111
- But you didn't say that.
- Exactly.

26:48.278 --> 26:51.990
Listen,
there's something big going on here,

26:52.073 --> 26:54.242
and I think I know what it is,

26:54.326 --> 26:57.120
and if I'm right,
it's bigger than all of us.

26:57.746 --> 26:59.789
Now we need
to put our differences aside

26:59.873 --> 27:01.791
and get back home as soon as possible

27:01.875 --> 27:03.376
so I can write this story.

27:04.377 --> 27:05.420
I need this, Bobo.

27:06.504 --> 27:07.672
I need you.

27:11.426 --> 27:14.304
Is that, is that a picture
of me on your dashboard?

27:15.722 --> 27:17.807
Fine. Oi.

27:19.267 --> 27:22.437
We'll park this beef, because I don't
mind being the bigger man.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.689
You don't have to do that.
I'll be the bigger man.

27:24.773 --> 27:26.441
No, no, no, no.
I insist.

27:26.608 --> 27:28.610
- Let me be bigger.
- It's cool.

27:29.402 --> 27:34.532
I'm already bigger, so it's just easier
if we think of me as being the bigger man.

27:38.328 --> 27:41.664
Great. Now, how are we
gonna fit five of us in this thing?

27:42.916 --> 27:44.459
Make that six.

28:01.851 --> 28:05.605
- Nothing.
- Oh my God, these are terrible.

28:07.273 --> 28:09.234
Nothing like my act.

28:09.651 --> 28:11.653
Look at this one.
The jugglenaut.

28:11.736 --> 28:14.072
A tower of clowns on fire.

28:16.783 --> 28:18.326
I mean, it makes no sense.

28:19.202 --> 28:22.122
Can you please stop critiquing
my childhood dreams?

28:22.372 --> 28:26.876
I mean, the clown at the bottom would
need to be built like a garden shed.

28:26.960 --> 28:32.090
The one on the top would have to be insane
I mean, certifiably clinically insane.

28:32.549 --> 28:34.217
And as for the one in the middle,

28:34.300 --> 28:38.763
well, this clown would have to be
so still, it was if he were frozen solid.

28:39.139 --> 28:40.306
But above all that,

28:40.390 --> 28:44.144
these three would have to be
willing to die for one another.

28:44.686 --> 28:47.021
You ever met a clown you'd die for?

28:56.614 --> 28:57.782
Hey! Stop the car!

28:59.826 --> 29:01.703
Stop the car.

29:07.167 --> 29:08.209
Clown scum!

29:08.293 --> 29:09.794
Jesus fucking--

29:12.464 --> 29:13.506
Come on, please!

29:13.590 --> 29:15.550
Just one fucking
text message, anything!

29:17.719 --> 29:19.220
What's happening to everybody?

29:21.181 --> 29:22.348
Come back, you bastard.

29:22.891 --> 29:23.892
That's quilted.

29:24.642 --> 29:27.103
That's four-ply. I need that.
Come back!

29:27.729 --> 29:28.730
Come back!

29:32.358 --> 29:33.985
Wait. Stop the car.

29:34.527 --> 29:35.987
Maybe there's someone there.

29:36.070 --> 29:39.282
Oh, good call, Jennifer.
I could eat a horse's ass.

29:42.660 --> 29:45.747
Uh, Jennifer,
I'll have a tall latte, the mixed grill

29:45.830 --> 29:48.374
and some Trebor
Triple X mints please.

29:48.458 --> 29:50.376
Get it yourself, you boiled gammon.

29:56.591 --> 29:58.551
Look, I don't mean to pry,

29:58.635 --> 30:00.345
but does anyone ever tell you,

30:00.428 --> 30:03.640
you remind them of a certain
Stephen King novel?

30:03.723 --> 30:07.852
- What's a Stephen King novel?
- Right.

30:08.478 --> 30:10.104
Um, have you seen <i>It?</i>

30:10.396 --> 30:11.397
What?

30:11.689 --> 30:13.983
<i>- It. It.</i> Have you seen <i>It?</i>
- Have I seen what?

30:14.067 --> 30:16.945
<i>It! It!</i> Fuck.
It's a film. <i>It!</i>

30:17.028 --> 30:20.824
Yes, I've seen a film. I've seen, um...

30:20.907 --> 30:24.869
<i>Babe: Pig in the City.</i>
Changed my life.

30:25.411 --> 30:27.455
Yeah. All right. Well it's...

30:28.164 --> 30:32.585
It's like Babe, except instead of a pig,
it's a clown.

30:32.669 --> 30:34.838
And instead of really
wanting to herd sheep,

30:34.921 --> 30:37.006
he really wants to murder children.

30:37.924 --> 30:38.925
Cool!

30:41.219 --> 30:43.096
What was that?

30:45.598 --> 30:47.600
There is nothing left to steal.

30:48.268 --> 30:50.353
Just move on and you'll come to no harm.

30:50.436 --> 30:53.356
Stay calm.
I am a journalist. A good one.

30:53.439 --> 30:56.526
Leave this to me, Jennifer.
I know how to speak to perverts.

30:56.609 --> 31:00.572
Listen, by all means, have your filthy
way with him, but let the rest of us go.

31:00.697 --> 31:02.574
Oh my God. You're--

31:02.657 --> 31:03.908
You're...

31:05.034 --> 31:07.579
- You're bleeding slightly.
- It's nothing.

31:07.662 --> 31:10.081
No, I think-- I think it's, um...
I think it's something serious.

31:10.164 --> 31:12.166
We should take your shirt off right now.

31:12.375 --> 31:15.211
Listen to the man, Jenny.
There's nothing for us to steal.

31:15.295 --> 31:16.296
Let's go please.

31:16.754 --> 31:17.922
So you're a journalist?

31:18.506 --> 31:20.341
Written all over my face, huh?

31:20.425 --> 31:22.886
No. It was literally
the first thing you said.

31:23.595 --> 31:25.138
Yeah. Okay, um...

31:25.930 --> 31:27.390
What happened here?

31:28.933 --> 31:33.187
The flash in the sky,
everything stopped working.

31:34.063 --> 31:36.274
Sent people insane.

31:37.442 --> 31:41.863
They look like animals fighting
over snack boxes and condiments.

31:42.530 --> 31:44.240
And then we ran out supplies.

31:44.574 --> 31:46.117
They turned on each other.

31:46.784 --> 31:48.620
The sun. I knew it!

31:49.037 --> 31:52.874
Working nights in a burger
trailer in the midlands of Ireland.

31:53.833 --> 31:57.462
I thought I had seen the lowest
humanity could sink.

31:58.421 --> 31:59.756
But this...

31:59.964 --> 32:03.301
A few hours without
Wi-Fi and civilization has crumbled.

32:08.431 --> 32:10.016
What fresh hell is this?

32:11.100 --> 32:12.143
Hyah!

32:14.812 --> 32:15.813
Statues.

32:20.485 --> 32:22.445
I'll hold them back. Save yourselves!

32:25.365 --> 32:26.783
But I want to stay with you!

32:26.908 --> 32:29.243
- Go with your friends.
- They're not my friends.

32:29.327 --> 32:31.454
Fuck fuck, fuck!
Fuck, fuck fuck! Fuck fuck!

32:40.004 --> 32:41.005
Shit.

32:41.172 --> 32:44.759
If something happened to you.
I could never forgive myself.

32:45.176 --> 32:47.887
- Get in the clown car.
- I don't want to!

32:47.971 --> 32:49.055
Get in the clown car!

32:49.722 --> 32:51.182
Go, go, go!

32:59.440 --> 33:01.025
Put your bloody foot down!

33:02.318 --> 33:04.445
It's a wind-up car,
what do you expect?

33:07.615 --> 33:10.451
A solar flare!
I knew it! I was right.

33:10.576 --> 33:14.539
All those years of being called
a crank, a joke, a conspiracy nut,

33:14.747 --> 33:16.082
a flat chested virgin.

33:16.457 --> 33:18.292
Well, fuck you, Mum.

33:18.668 --> 33:20.003
Look at me now!

33:21.504 --> 33:25.925
Calm down and focus on me. Now if
we can just get on the road

33:26.009 --> 33:29.220
we'll have me back in time
for my sound check. Yes?

33:29.679 --> 33:32.306
- Didn't you hear what I said?
- Something about being a virgin?

33:32.390 --> 33:33.933
Just show some respect.

33:34.017 --> 33:36.978
- The lady is definitely not a virgin.
- Oh, shut up Bobo.

33:37.061 --> 33:38.646
Look.

33:38.730 --> 33:41.983
The country, the whole country,
maybe the world, has gone dark.

33:42.525 --> 33:45.278
A solar flare of this
magnitude will have blown out

33:45.361 --> 33:49.657
- power grids, comms, satellites.
- So no TV?

33:49.741 --> 33:53.202
No internet, no sound check!

33:53.286 --> 33:55.038
No Serbian pornography.

33:55.121 --> 34:00.460
Anything wireless, anything digital,
anything with a computer in it, basically,

34:00.543 --> 34:02.920
is as dead as the clown
on the roof of this car.

34:09.761 --> 34:12.722
Look! Some kids alone
by the side of the road!

34:12.805 --> 34:13.973
Stop the car!

34:14.057 --> 34:16.768
- Why? What are you going to do to them?
- Come on.

34:16.851 --> 34:20.813
We don't need computers,
or a fancy concert hall

34:20.897 --> 34:23.858
or parental consent to do a clown show.

34:24.358 --> 34:25.860
Those kids are gonna love it.

34:25.943 --> 34:26.944
Let's go.

34:27.028 --> 34:29.322
No. No, I don't do that any more.

34:30.323 --> 34:32.450
The world is ours now.

34:32.867 --> 34:34.577
Waaah!

34:38.039 --> 34:41.209
No, Funzo, stop!
Funzo, Leave them alone!

34:41.292 --> 34:43.586
Stop! Leave them alone!

34:46.297 --> 34:49.175
So what's our schtick?
Good clown, bad clown?

34:49.258 --> 34:50.593
Maybe we both go bad clown,

34:50.676 --> 34:53.096
- fuck with their heads a bit.
- Just leave them alone, yeah?

34:54.263 --> 34:57.225
It's called Street Clowning.
Watch and learn.

34:59.435 --> 35:03.439
Hey kids, I don't feel very well.

35:05.066 --> 35:08.444
I think I'm gonna...

35:24.669 --> 35:26.671
Okay.
I think I'm good.

35:28.965 --> 35:29.966
Halt!

35:31.801 --> 35:36.180
Who are you to approach our younglings
at eventide, painted fool?

35:37.098 --> 35:38.850
Oh, we were just--

35:40.643 --> 35:43.104
We mean your children no harm, crone.

35:43.479 --> 35:48.860
We are but weary travelers seeking to
lay our master to rest.

35:49.277 --> 35:52.488
- You're from the townlands?
- Yes, ugly wench.

35:52.947 --> 35:57.869
What remains of them. We
hear tell of a great doom.

35:58.494 --> 36:02.665
Indeed. A great darkness
has embraced our kingdom.

36:05.293 --> 36:09.881
Come, the cloud fire is low.
You must be hungry.

36:12.758 --> 36:14.427
What in God's name is going on?

36:15.094 --> 36:17.930
- I think she's gonna make us a feast.
- Oh fine.

36:18.389 --> 36:20.808
Our survival has been hard-won.

36:22.226 --> 36:25.563
This fellowship relies on the
ancient wisdom of our ancestors

36:26.063 --> 36:28.357
- from the Before Times.
- Yesterday?

36:28.608 --> 36:31.694
Now we grow Dustroot and Gelpwort.

36:32.570 --> 36:34.113
Hail fellow chieftain.

36:34.906 --> 36:38.951
Hey, sorry about Siobhan.
She's really fucking high.

36:40.786 --> 36:44.332
I'm Fintan. And you must be... clowns?

36:45.291 --> 36:48.586
Nope, not for me.
Retired from all that bollocks.

36:48.669 --> 36:52.965
I studied movement myself, actually.
Come, chill with us. Stay for the night.

36:53.257 --> 36:55.760
Come on, Siobhan,
we'll get you a glass of water.

36:56.135 --> 36:57.511
What is this place?

36:58.095 --> 36:59.805
We call it Xanadu.

37:01.557 --> 37:03.142
It's a boutique micro festival.

37:03.226 --> 37:06.145
Chill beats, ethical street food,
vibes for days.

37:06.229 --> 37:08.898
Or at least it was before the power cut.

37:09.774 --> 37:11.108
Now we're castaways.

37:11.442 --> 37:15.655
All our Priuses are dead,
we've had to ration our food,

37:15.738 --> 37:17.531
collect rainwater.

37:18.366 --> 37:21.786
But we still have a veritable
cornucopia of class A drugs.

37:21.869 --> 37:23.537
Ah, drugs, you say?

37:23.621 --> 37:26.666
Well, maybe this evening
doesn't need to be a total loss.

37:27.250 --> 37:29.752
You know, Angus Deayton
used to call me The Dyson.

37:31.587 --> 37:34.423
Here we are. Lodgings for the night.

37:34.507 --> 37:36.008
Real Himalayan vibes.

37:36.467 --> 37:39.220
- I hope you don't mind sharing tents.
- No, that's fine.

37:39.303 --> 37:40.429
How about, uh...

37:40.513 --> 37:42.056
me and Jenny take this one,

37:42.181 --> 37:45.559
and the lesser males share with Funzo.

37:45.893 --> 37:48.604
Sounds good.
Come on, let me show you my salt lamp.

37:48.813 --> 37:49.814
Oi.

37:50.690 --> 37:52.817
Can we have a word,
mano to mano?

37:53.609 --> 37:54.610
Eh?

37:55.861 --> 37:58.823
Look, we're both alpha clowns.
I get it, I get it, I get it.

37:59.782 --> 38:00.992
Rival silverbacks.

38:01.826 --> 38:04.870
Two bull walruses stinking up the beach
with our battle musk.

38:05.538 --> 38:08.165
But I want to save you some
embarrassment here, buddy.

38:10.042 --> 38:13.754
Jenny is off the menu.

38:16.382 --> 38:18.801
If we are both walruses, Booboo,

38:19.260 --> 38:22.179
I think it's pretty clear who
the beach master is.

38:23.264 --> 38:25.891
'Cause when you're
the fattest thing on the sand

38:26.976 --> 38:32.231
you don't have to steal anything.
It all just comes waddling towards you.

38:41.532 --> 38:43.326
<i>Governments were warned.</i>

38:43.409 --> 38:47.371
<i>...satellite communications were--
nanas, bananas-- toilet paper...</i>

38:48.080 --> 38:50.207
Can you believe this thing actually works?

38:50.291 --> 38:52.335
Kids'll watch anything
with a screen.

38:52.418 --> 38:55.838
That's live?
But how is he broadcasting?

38:57.381 --> 38:59.592
He must have an analogue
OB transmitter or...

38:59.675 --> 39:01.010
<i>You have to hear me.</i>

39:02.303 --> 39:03.637
<i>This isn't over, people.</i>

39:03.763 --> 39:05.139
Christ, is that Tim?

39:05.514 --> 39:07.475
How did that charlatan get on the TV?

39:08.768 --> 39:11.896
- You know that man?
- That's Tim from Bromanz.

39:11.979 --> 39:14.648
He and his brother
were in a hot boy band.

39:15.149 --> 39:18.235
- Bromanz.
- Brothers, but also men.

39:18.319 --> 39:21.197
Spelled with a zed
because it was the nineties.

39:21.614 --> 39:24.658
He moved into a fallout bunker
and became a recluse.

39:25.117 --> 39:28.662
We used to party with the Lighthouse
Family back in the good old days.

39:29.330 --> 39:30.623
You know where he lives?

39:30.706 --> 39:32.958
I need to meet him,
find out what he knows.

39:33.042 --> 39:34.251
Oh, he'll never talk.

39:34.752 --> 39:37.004
And neither will
the Lighthouse Family.

39:37.296 --> 39:39.090
About the solar flare, you idiot.

39:39.590 --> 39:41.759
Maybe he can shed some light
on what's going on.

39:41.842 --> 39:44.637
- He could be the key to my story.
- Maybe.

39:44.845 --> 39:47.056
How come you know so
much about transmitters?

39:47.264 --> 39:49.225
I actually grew up in a broadcast van.

39:49.308 --> 39:52.103
My mother would just leave me
there for hours at a time

39:52.186 --> 39:54.772
with a bowl of water
and the window slightly open.

39:54.980 --> 39:56.315
Well then,

39:56.399 --> 39:58.734
I think perhaps, Jennifer,

39:58.818 --> 40:02.822
you and I should pay Tim
from Bromanz a little visit.

40:02.905 --> 40:05.991
<i>Sorry to tell you this.
Word has reached me from Dublin.</i>

40:06.158 --> 40:07.493
<i>It's just as I predicted.</i>

40:08.077 --> 40:09.578
<i>Society has collapsed.</i>

40:09.912 --> 40:11.622
<i>There's looting, there's killing.</i>

40:12.206 --> 40:15.709
<i>There's rioting on the streets.
People have turned against one another.</i>

40:16.001 --> 40:18.796
<i>- The government are doing nothing.</i>

40:19.880 --> 40:21.173
<i>This just in...</i>

40:21.715 --> 40:23.676
Garth Brooks is dead.

40:26.303 --> 40:27.304
Fuck.

40:28.305 --> 40:32.101
- Dublin has fallen!
- Oh my god, my children!

40:32.226 --> 40:34.603
We have to do something!

40:35.855 --> 40:36.981
So lads...

40:37.064 --> 40:38.524
If I'm being honest,

40:39.400 --> 40:41.652
it's hard to know what
tomorrow's gonna bring,

40:41.735 --> 40:43.737
but we still have tonight, right?

40:44.405 --> 40:46.574
And while we might be running low on hope,

40:46.657 --> 40:48.033
we still have a pretty decent supply

40:48.117 --> 40:50.035
of some other essentials,
if you know what I mean.

40:50.119 --> 40:53.789
So let's all raise a glass
and let the world know

40:53.873 --> 40:56.584
that we're absolutely sending it tonight!

40:56.667 --> 40:58.377
This is our boutique festival.

40:58.461 --> 40:59.462
Yeah!

40:59.587 --> 41:00.713
And we're not afraid!

41:02.423 --> 41:04.925
Yes.

41:05.050 --> 41:06.886
Wait, wait. What's in this?

41:07.219 --> 41:10.264
Hard to say, but if I had to
estimate a street value

41:10.347 --> 41:12.683
I'd say about three, four hundred quid.

41:47.718 --> 41:50.513
I don't like this.
I don't like this.

41:52.556 --> 41:54.892
I don't like this.
I don't like this.

41:57.061 --> 41:59.897
Bury me with dignity,
you talentless buffoon.

42:00.231 --> 42:05.736
I will! You'll be in Père Lachaise
with the Masters in a proper grave.

42:06.195 --> 42:07.696
Dug by a professional.

42:07.988 --> 42:10.074
You will never be a true clown.

42:11.450 --> 42:13.118
No.

42:13.202 --> 42:14.703
No!

42:18.040 --> 42:20.334
No!

42:23.170 --> 42:24.463
Bobo!

42:30.094 --> 42:33.389
Oh, isn't this amazing!

42:33.472 --> 42:35.766
These are the best people!

42:36.725 --> 42:37.977
Oh, look at us.

42:38.644 --> 42:40.813
Doing what we love.

42:40.896 --> 42:43.357
Me, a real journalist.

42:43.440 --> 42:46.318
Following leads. Getting the story.

42:46.569 --> 42:48.946
And you!

42:50.990 --> 42:55.744
Can you feel your thumbs? I'm really
conscious of my thumbs for some reason.

42:55.953 --> 42:59.540
Such a shame you're not a clown any more.
You were so good.

43:00.207 --> 43:01.208
Really?

43:01.333 --> 43:04.003
Yeah. Yeah. At the show where we met.

43:04.753 --> 43:07.172
- Did you like that?
- Oh my God. Oh my God.

43:07.256 --> 43:10.301
You should do a show for all these people.
They would love it.

43:10.676 --> 43:14.513
It's like Funzo said,
the world is yours now.

43:15.014 --> 43:17.891
Alright then, I will!
I'll be a clown again.

43:18.559 --> 43:21.270
- I'll do a show.
- Yeah! Do you have any gum?

43:23.397 --> 43:26.609
A show, you say? Great idea, Jennifer.

43:27.026 --> 43:28.027
A clown-off.

43:28.902 --> 43:31.280
Let's see whether Booboo has
got anything in his little book

43:31.363 --> 43:36.535
that can hold up under the crushing
weight of my enormous talent.

43:36.827 --> 43:39.955
Yeah! Yeah.
You should do the trick in your book.

43:40.164 --> 43:43.542
The one Alphonso said was fucking stupid.

43:46.086 --> 43:47.546
What, the Jugglenaut?

43:55.137 --> 43:58.641
I am a business man.
I am a business man!

43:59.183 --> 44:02.853
I am a business man!

44:04.355 --> 44:05.356
I need your help.

44:06.190 --> 44:07.816
I'm a business man.

44:08.901 --> 44:10.736
We could never do that!

44:10.861 --> 44:12.613
We'd go down in flames!

44:12.696 --> 44:15.491
Or in history,
as true clowning legends.

44:15.949 --> 44:19.787
- I thought you were done with clowning.
- No, the world was done with clowning.

44:19.870 --> 44:23.499
It moved on to TikTok dances and
live streaming hand jobs on the dark web.

44:23.582 --> 44:25.876
- Ah!
- And none of that works now.

44:26.418 --> 44:29.338
Everything is obsolete except us.

44:30.172 --> 44:32.091
This is our moment.
Can't you see?

44:32.883 --> 44:36.345
This is our opportunity to
clown like the masters before us.

44:37.513 --> 44:41.058
Grimaldi. Gaullier

44:41.141 --> 44:42.893
- McDonald
- No, not McDonald.

44:42.976 --> 44:44.395
- DuCoque!
- DuCoque.

44:46.105 --> 44:48.357
Okay, we're forming a troupe.

44:48.732 --> 44:51.235
No, we're just gonna do
this one trick and then...

44:51.318 --> 44:54.113
I'm reasonably confident
I don't have hepatitis any more.

44:54.196 --> 44:55.406
Okay, I'm not touching that.

44:55.489 --> 44:58.117
You don't touch it,
you spread it on your asshole.

44:58.951 --> 45:01.578
Will you excuse us for one second please?

45:01.745 --> 45:02.746
Sure.

45:03.664 --> 45:06.208
That clown has gone fully scary.

45:07.042 --> 45:09.545
And we both know there is
no coming back from that.

45:09.628 --> 45:12.297
So what should we call our troupe?

45:13.048 --> 45:17.636
I know.
How about Clown-pedo?

45:18.595 --> 45:21.014
You know, like a torpedo of clowns?

45:22.224 --> 45:24.601
Look, this is a three clown trick.

45:24.893 --> 45:26.645
Are you in or not?

45:28.397 --> 45:31.692
Ladies and jellybeans,

45:31.775 --> 45:35.404
stamp your footsies
and wiggle your ears

45:35.487 --> 45:38.699
for the silliest billy around,

45:38.782 --> 45:42.536
The Great Alphonso!

45:42.619 --> 45:44.788
Yeah!

45:45.539 --> 45:48.333
Hey, but where are the audience?

45:48.417 --> 45:49.668
Hello audience?

45:50.294 --> 45:51.295
Hello?

45:52.212 --> 45:53.213
Audience!

45:54.131 --> 45:56.049
Ah, I have an idea.

45:56.133 --> 45:58.719
You haven't had an
original idea in your life.

45:58.802 --> 46:00.846
You skit-stealing fuckpipe.

46:01.805 --> 46:03.891
Ah, there you are!

46:03.974 --> 46:07.352
You will never be a true clown.

46:08.437 --> 46:11.607
Yeah, I might need to take
a rain check on this show.

46:11.690 --> 46:16.612
It's just, um, oh, this is not really my,
my crowd, but, um, uh, break a leg, guys.

46:16.695 --> 46:18.780
I am sure you're going to smash it, so...

46:18.864 --> 46:20.741
- Wait!
- Hey!

46:20.991 --> 46:23.202
We've come too far
for you to wuss out now.

46:23.285 --> 46:26.371
This is our chance to
win back the woman that I love,

46:26.455 --> 46:30.334
and have our revenge
on my nemesis, Alphonso.

46:31.877 --> 46:34.213
So what do you say, my friends? Hm?

46:35.422 --> 46:38.342
Are we in this together or what?

46:40.636 --> 46:42.596
Yeah. I'm still gonna sit this one out.

46:42.679 --> 46:45.974
- Say the magic words.
- Five second call, fellas.

46:46.141 --> 46:48.560
I hope I don't fall in this pie!

46:50.812 --> 46:53.857
- It's just started.
- Yeah. But I spiked his pie.

46:53.941 --> 46:55.692
- With what?
- With spikes.

46:59.154 --> 47:00.822
Showtime!

47:00.906 --> 47:04.159
Ladies and gentlemen!

47:05.410 --> 47:06.703
Shut up a sec.

47:06.787 --> 47:10.207
- Jesus Christ, my eye!
- Funzo what the bloody hell have you done?

47:10.290 --> 47:11.583
Help me! My beautiful eye!

47:11.667 --> 47:16.129
- Jesus Christ.
- The ciliary muscle has been compromised!

47:16.296 --> 47:19.841
So what we're going to do now is a trick
I know. So hope you enjoy.

47:19.925 --> 47:21.218
Pepe, hup!

47:21.802 --> 47:23.387
Get out of the way!

47:23.470 --> 47:24.638
Pepe, I said hup.

47:24.721 --> 47:27.391
He's bottled it. Time to go to Plan B.

47:27.474 --> 47:30.519
- Plan B? We haven't got a Plan B.
- Hi everybody!

47:30.602 --> 47:32.854
Who wants to die?

47:34.606 --> 47:38.402
With laughter!
I meant to say with laughter.

47:38.485 --> 47:40.946
Oh, and this was supposed to be a flower.

47:41.113 --> 47:43.073
Uh, who likes dancing?

47:43.448 --> 47:45.534
Yeah. Don't go.

47:46.535 --> 47:50.622
<i>♪If you're happy and you know it,
Clap your hands. Oi! Oi! ♪</i>

47:50.789 --> 47:53.458
<i>♪ If you're happy and you know it,
Clap your hands ♪</i>

47:53.542 --> 47:55.294
- Put the knife down please.
- What?

47:55.377 --> 47:56.753
<i>♪ If you're happy and you know it ♪</i>

47:56.837 --> 47:59.298
<i>- ♪ And you really want to show it ♪</i>

48:03.510 --> 48:05.470
Oh, Funzo!

48:10.475 --> 48:13.353
Rain hell!

48:13.437 --> 48:14.479
Run!

48:40.339 --> 48:43.717
Jenny!

49:07.616 --> 49:09.326
Good morning, lazybones.

49:09.993 --> 49:12.079
- What happened? Where are we going?
- Paris.

49:12.162 --> 49:14.331
We're going to steal a yacht
and take DuCoque home.

49:14.414 --> 49:16.500
What?
No, no, we have to go after Jenny.

49:16.750 --> 49:18.126
Why would we do that?

49:18.210 --> 49:20.712
Because Alphonso kidnapped her,
you turquoise dick.

49:20.796 --> 49:22.130
- Now turn around!
- No! Stop!

49:22.214 --> 49:24.716
- You're gonna get us killed.
- No, you're gonna get us killed.

49:24.800 --> 49:27.469
No, I'm going to get us killed.
Yeah!

49:29.221 --> 49:31.264
Let women drive!

49:33.892 --> 49:34.893
Oh shit.

49:39.648 --> 49:40.649
Oh, fantastic.

49:42.192 --> 49:44.027
Well, looks like we're walking.

49:44.695 --> 49:48.073
- They can't have gone far.
- No, we can't just leave Monsieur here.

49:48.657 --> 49:50.283
Uh, we can, and we should

49:50.367 --> 49:52.828
because he's starting
to smell like a chef's ass.

49:53.578 --> 49:54.996
Right. Which way's North?

49:55.497 --> 49:57.624
I think you're supposed to follow the sun.

49:58.458 --> 50:01.336
And are we following the sun
or are we following your dick?

50:02.003 --> 50:06.633
Jenny is in danger and I need to rescue
her from that fat nonce.

50:07.175 --> 50:09.386
Do you though?
I mean they looked pretty cozy

50:09.469 --> 50:11.638
on the back of that
emotional support horse.

50:12.764 --> 50:15.726
Right. You two can either
come with me and be heroes,

50:16.560 --> 50:19.187
or you can starve out here
and end up like your hero.

50:23.066 --> 50:25.861
- Fine. We'll follow the sun.
- Hmm.

50:25.944 --> 50:28.905
but when we reach it,
I am coming back for DuCoque.

50:34.745 --> 50:37.414
This is just troupe banter, right?

50:37.706 --> 50:39.499
We'd never split up, right?

50:40.792 --> 50:43.879
Nah. Clown-pedo is 'til death.

50:46.506 --> 50:47.758
Wait for me!

50:48.383 --> 50:50.594
Hyah!

50:50.677 --> 50:54.139
Onward trusty steed and away!

50:58.393 --> 51:04.316
Yes, me and Tim from Bromanz used to
stagger back here drunk once a fortnight.

51:04.566 --> 51:08.069
God, I know this old place
like the back of his head.

51:11.907 --> 51:14.493
How are you so perky?
Didn't you lose an eye?

51:14.826 --> 51:17.496
I took a handful of these.

51:17.579 --> 51:19.456
I don't know exactly what they are,

51:19.539 --> 51:22.626
but they're actually making me
prefer having just the one eye.

51:24.419 --> 51:27.631
Tim from Bromanz,
as I live and breathe.

51:27.714 --> 51:30.467
You won't be doing either for long
if you don't identify yourself.

51:30.550 --> 51:35.555
Tim it's me, Alphonso. Fonzie Bear.
The Fondler.

51:36.056 --> 51:40.519
- Al? I haven't seen you since...
- The after party.

51:42.687 --> 51:43.855
Who's your friend?

51:44.523 --> 51:48.235
Jenny Malone. Viral Load Media.
I'm a journalist.

51:48.318 --> 51:50.278
Wasn't there that evening.
I left before nine.

51:50.362 --> 51:53.198
I swear to God, there was nothing
going on that I knew about anyway.

51:53.281 --> 51:55.158
Tim, it's not about that.

51:55.325 --> 51:59.037
Jennifer here has got a theory
about what's happened to the world

51:59.496 --> 52:01.957
and we think you could help us.

52:02.040 --> 52:04.751
Oh, hello?

52:05.043 --> 52:06.670
Oh, hello doggy.

52:07.337 --> 52:09.881
Hello. You're so cute.
Yes you are.

52:11.341 --> 52:13.385
- Can we come in?
- Uh...

52:13.468 --> 52:15.512
Sure that's a yes.
Thank you.

52:19.891 --> 52:20.892
Shakira.

52:21.685 --> 52:22.686
Come on.

52:26.273 --> 52:29.818
Poor thing's very sick.
Got her on heavy sedatives.

52:30.735 --> 52:35.240
She's been with me through it all.
The fame, the fall.

52:36.825 --> 52:40.287
Years of people
calling me a tinfoil hat wanker.

52:41.246 --> 52:43.331
She's all I've got now.

52:43.415 --> 52:45.584
Ah, Rolf!

52:46.960 --> 52:51.756
Dreadful pervert, of course.
But by God could that man draw a kangaroo.

52:51.923 --> 52:54.134
Good girl, Shakira.

52:54.634 --> 52:58.138
- We saw your broadcast.
- I didn't think it was reaching anyone.

52:58.597 --> 53:01.266
- I know what's happening. It's a--
- Solar flare.

53:02.225 --> 53:04.561
Exactly.

53:04.936 --> 53:06.688
Good old Flex!

53:06.771 --> 53:09.232
You know I was friends
with all of the Gladiators.

53:09.316 --> 53:11.818
Yes. All except for Pegasus.

53:12.444 --> 53:16.865
Let's just say I plowed his wife
and uh, we'll leave it at that.

53:17.282 --> 53:19.451
Traitors, the bloody lot of them.

53:20.577 --> 53:23.955
How are we not prepared for this?
The government must have known.

53:24.039 --> 53:25.040
Of course they knew.

53:25.415 --> 53:28.501
They've known for years.
They wanted this to happen.

53:30.003 --> 53:31.129
All of this...

53:31.963 --> 53:33.465
this is only the beginning.

53:34.758 --> 53:38.303
What I'm about to tell you goes deeper
than you could possibly imagine.

53:39.304 --> 53:42.265
But before I start...

53:42.349 --> 53:44.559
does anyone want tea?

53:47.562 --> 53:48.939
Milk?

53:50.482 --> 53:53.276
It's UHT Milk.
Is that okay?

53:54.945 --> 53:57.322
Sugar.
One? Two?

53:58.156 --> 54:00.867
One for you. Two for you.
Both with milk.

54:00.951 --> 54:02.953
Do you know what?
I'll just put everything on a tray,

54:03.036 --> 54:05.538
and bring it out.
You can make your own.

54:19.636 --> 54:21.763
It goes on and on.

54:22.555 --> 54:25.433
I can't take much more of this.
I'm so hungry.

54:26.559 --> 54:28.478
Why aren't there any bistros?

54:29.479 --> 54:30.563
I give up.

54:35.193 --> 54:36.444
Jenny doesn't love me.

54:37.195 --> 54:38.780
She was on ecstasy.

54:40.699 --> 54:42.450
What the hell was I thinking?

54:48.540 --> 54:54.254
Hey. I know things look really bleak
right now, but that's just because

54:54.337 --> 54:56.172
things are really bleak right now.

55:00.427 --> 55:01.928
It's time to face facts.

55:03.513 --> 55:04.723
I'm a terrible clown.

55:07.559 --> 55:10.353
Yeah, yeah, you are.

55:12.814 --> 55:14.315
Oh, like you're any better?

55:14.399 --> 55:15.525
What good is all that training

55:15.608 --> 55:17.610
if you can't get on stage
without browning your trousers?

55:18.028 --> 55:20.822
Lots of great artists
struggled in their early years.

55:20.905 --> 55:21.906
Early years?

55:22.032 --> 55:24.075
How long you gonna
be chasing this dream?

55:24.159 --> 55:26.453
Ten years. I'm going to chase
the dream for ten years and then,

55:26.536 --> 55:29.247
- I'm just gonna live the dream.
- Oh, cool. Didn't realize you had a plan.

55:29.330 --> 55:30.832
- Yep.
- That changes everything.

55:30.915 --> 55:33.126
It does, doesn't it?
Just stick to your plan,

55:33.209 --> 55:35.086
believe in yourself,
and never give up.

55:37.338 --> 55:39.466
That's what all the great clowns did.

55:41.009 --> 55:42.510
I mean, sure, there's...

55:43.136 --> 55:47.307
millions of deluded people out there who
believe in themselves and should give up.

55:49.684 --> 55:50.935
But I'm not one of them.

55:52.854 --> 55:54.355
I'm in that first category.

55:55.231 --> 55:58.443
That's something I've always
known deep in my heart.

56:01.738 --> 56:04.157
And your heart can't be wrong, can it?

56:15.210 --> 56:16.211
Oh, fuck.

56:20.882 --> 56:24.385
Hey, put that back on! You are a
DuCoque-trained buffoon!

56:25.762 --> 56:26.763
I'm not.

56:28.139 --> 56:32.310
I trained under him for three minutes
and I was so bad that he died.

56:32.852 --> 56:35.480
But you're such a pretentious wanker.

56:36.106 --> 56:38.525
- I'm self-taught.
- It doesn't matter.

56:38.608 --> 56:40.693
We're not giving up.
We're a troupe.

56:42.028 --> 56:43.029
Aren't we?

56:44.447 --> 56:45.782
This is our time.

56:45.865 --> 56:47.117
You said it yourself.

56:47.617 --> 56:49.202
This isn't our time.

56:50.203 --> 56:53.164
I only said that cause I needed
your help to impress Jenny.

56:54.457 --> 56:56.042
The world doesn't need us.

56:57.252 --> 56:58.753
It never needed us.

56:58.837 --> 57:02.382
It would be better for everyone if we all
just sit down and quietly die.

57:02.465 --> 57:03.925
We are not all going to die.

57:04.050 --> 57:06.553
One of us will die
and the other two will eat him.

57:06.636 --> 57:07.804
That's you, Pepe.

57:08.680 --> 57:11.349
Oh, there she is.
Welcome back, It.

57:11.975 --> 57:14.477
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, come on Funzo.

57:14.561 --> 57:16.271
We all know what you are.

57:16.354 --> 57:18.857
- Don't you say the S word.
- Oh, don't say the S word.

57:18.940 --> 57:22.444
What else would you call a clown
who asks children if they want to die?

57:23.445 --> 57:26.739
- A trailblazer who lives on the edge?
- You live in a sewer.

57:26.823 --> 57:28.366
Where else was I gonna go, huh?

57:28.450 --> 57:30.910
Back to the sanitarium?
I don't think so.

57:30.994 --> 57:33.913
Are you even listening to yourself?
You are a walking Halloween costume.

57:33.997 --> 57:36.583
You are what children check for
under their bed at night.

57:36.666 --> 57:40.003
- Don't do it, Pepe.
- No! She needs to know.

57:40.545 --> 57:45.133
Funzo. You are a scary clown.

57:45.216 --> 57:49.804
I'm not a fucking scary clown.

57:51.556 --> 57:54.267
Yes you are, but you don't scare me
you little bastard.

57:54.726 --> 57:56.769
Then lets settle this the clown way.

57:58.688 --> 58:00.940
Last one to die wins.

58:01.483 --> 58:03.818
- Since when is that the clown way?
- Calm down.

58:03.902 --> 58:06.029
I'm going to wear your skin as a cape.

58:06.613 --> 58:10.700
Set the table, Bobo. Tonight we feast on
wussy-wussy puss-puss.

58:20.752 --> 58:25.173
My God, I am a scary clown.

58:25.465 --> 58:30.220
I'm really glad you had a breakthrough,
but there's a fucking knife in my hand.

58:30.345 --> 58:33.264
- Do I push or pull? Push or pull?
- Pull, obviously.

58:40.563 --> 58:44.817
Hey, that car looks just
like yours, what are the chances?

58:45.276 --> 58:47.195
Oh fuck off.

59:14.973 --> 59:18.851
Now that we're on our knees, they
can roll out whatever protocols

59:18.935 --> 59:21.688
they want with zero resistance.

59:22.188 --> 59:23.982
We're like ducks...

59:24.232 --> 59:25.400
...in a vice.

59:26.734 --> 59:27.860
Quack.

59:28.444 --> 59:30.655
It's all so obvious.

59:31.072 --> 59:33.116
They're gonna let society eat itself.

59:33.575 --> 59:36.661
We need to get this information
out there before it's too late.

59:37.036 --> 59:40.999
I've been trying, but my transmitter
won't reach more than 20 to 30 miles.

59:41.082 --> 59:44.836
So we need a mast,
like 50 or 60 feet high.

59:45.420 --> 59:47.672
We could bring the truth
to the whole country.

59:48.339 --> 59:51.509
I have a pretty big one,
and as it happens it's still erect.

59:52.051 --> 59:53.553
It's in here somewhere.

59:56.264 --> 59:59.183
This is my big top.

59:59.267 --> 01:00:02.937
Now it hasn't been used in years,
but the main mast is still standing,

01:00:03.021 --> 01:00:04.564
proud and tall.

01:00:04.897 --> 01:00:06.274
Like a penis.

01:00:06.941 --> 01:00:08.401
This is perfect, Tim.

01:00:08.693 --> 01:00:11.446
I rig your transmitter to this
mast and then you and me

01:00:11.529 --> 01:00:13.656
could present an emergency report.

01:00:13.906 --> 01:00:14.949
We could save lives.

01:00:15.366 --> 01:00:17.910
No, no, no.

01:00:17.994 --> 01:00:19.662
Shakira is very sick.

01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:22.874
I can't leave her.
She's an indoor dog.

01:00:23.958 --> 01:00:26.961
She hasn't left here in 15 years,
and neither have I.

01:00:27.045 --> 01:00:29.297
Tim, I need you to be brave.

01:00:30.131 --> 01:00:31.883
The people need you.

01:00:31.966 --> 01:00:34.927
Just like your brother needed
an identical version of hims--

01:00:35.011 --> 01:00:36.179
My brother is dead.

01:00:37.764 --> 01:00:40.892
I'm sorry, I'm just not up for this.

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:44.771
If not for us, Tim,
then do it for Shakira.

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:49.776
Look into her eyes and tell me
you don't want this bitch to live

01:00:49.859 --> 01:00:51.903
in a world that knows the truth.

01:00:56.532 --> 01:00:57.533
I'll do it.

01:01:00.495 --> 01:01:03.665
Can't find my driving gloves.
Gonna have to borrow yours, Jenny.

01:01:04.666 --> 01:01:08.002
Jenny? Jenny? Jenny.

01:01:08.086 --> 01:01:11.047
- Do you think it's safe for you to drive?
- Oh, buckle up, you painted ham.

01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:13.049
I've driven bigger rigs than this.

01:01:13.132 --> 01:01:14.133
God help us.

01:01:21.599 --> 01:01:24.268
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.
- Go, go, go, go.

01:01:32.276 --> 01:01:36.197
No! Shakira...
No!

01:01:39.617 --> 01:01:41.285
It was my sixth birthday.

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:46.332
Me and my two best friends snuck
into the circus and saw the clowns.

01:01:47.291 --> 01:01:50.712
After that, all we wanted to do
was be like them.

01:01:52.505 --> 01:01:56.801
We even formed a troupe, the Superfriends.

01:01:59.595 --> 01:02:00.888
It wasn't my fault.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.521
What did you do?

01:02:10.523 --> 01:02:12.525
I misread the label.

01:02:13.192 --> 01:02:16.571
I thought I was dousing them
in laughter fluid.

01:02:22.201 --> 01:02:24.787
I couldn't handle what I'd done,

01:02:25.621 --> 01:02:28.207
so I created someone who could.

01:02:29.167 --> 01:02:34.213
I called her... Funzo.

01:02:39.218 --> 01:02:42.054
If I take this off,
I don't know who I'll be.

01:02:43.765 --> 01:02:45.308
Who were you before?

01:02:48.186 --> 01:02:49.520
Ja...

01:02:50.813 --> 01:02:52.148
Jan...

01:02:55.151 --> 01:02:56.861
Janet.

01:02:58.529 --> 01:02:59.989
My name was Janet.

01:03:02.074 --> 01:03:04.118
Well then you'll be Janet. Yeah.

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:05.703
- That's okay?
- It's okay.

01:03:05.787 --> 01:03:07.330
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

01:03:07.413 --> 01:03:10.041
- Yeah. You'll be Janet.
- Yeah, Janet. Yeah.

01:03:10.333 --> 01:03:12.794
- And I guess I'll be Ken.
- Ken.

01:03:13.419 --> 01:03:15.213
And I'll be Jean-Luc.

01:03:21.219 --> 01:03:22.220
Really?

01:03:22.303 --> 01:03:23.429
- Jean-Luc?
- Yeah.

01:03:23.513 --> 01:03:25.139
- That's your name?
- Jean-Luc.

01:03:26.599 --> 01:03:28.184
Why would I say it if I...

01:03:28.726 --> 01:03:33.314
It's no problem if it is. It's just,
Jean-Luc. Really? Come on.

01:03:36.192 --> 01:03:38.611
All right. Dean.
My actual name is Dean.

01:03:38.694 --> 01:03:42.156
- Okay.
- That's more believable. Yeah.

01:04:07.306 --> 01:04:10.560
- Janet.
- Dean.

01:04:11.561 --> 01:04:12.687
Ken.

01:04:13.271 --> 01:04:14.814
Hello, my name is Janet.

01:04:15.106 --> 01:04:17.483
- Hello, I'm Dean.
- Afternoon, I'm Ken.

01:04:18.359 --> 01:04:20.778
Welcome.
Thanks for having me.

01:04:21.362 --> 01:04:24.240
- Janet, Ken, Dean.
- Hello, my name is Dean.

01:04:24.323 --> 01:04:27.410
- Is this blouse unisex, or...
- Hello, my name is Janet

01:04:27.493 --> 01:04:29.370
and I'd like one plate of meat please.

01:04:29.537 --> 01:04:34.083
Hello, I'm Ken and I'm interested in
purchasing a secondhand microwave.

01:04:34.417 --> 01:04:37.712
I'm Janet, your new neighbor.
I just moved in beneath your house.

01:04:37.837 --> 01:04:41.173
Hello. I have a voucher for a couple's
massage, and my name is Dean.

01:04:42.425 --> 01:04:44.051
No, it's just me. Can I go twice?

01:04:44.552 --> 01:04:47.680
Hey, my name's Ken and I'm
your mum's new boyfriend.

01:04:49.015 --> 01:04:52.101
- <i>Et voilà.</i>
- Wow. It's bigger than I thought.

01:04:52.184 --> 01:04:54.562
I bet you never had a
woman tell you that before.

01:04:54.979 --> 01:04:58.524
Well actually, my prostate
doctor is female, so...

01:04:58.608 --> 01:05:00.610
Dr. Susan Wang.

01:05:03.237 --> 01:05:08.159
- Welcome to my humble home.
- Lovely.

01:05:15.791 --> 01:05:16.792
Did you...

01:05:25.509 --> 01:05:27.219
What was that?

01:05:31.557 --> 01:05:34.602
- Let's get back to the car.
- Don't worry. I speak child.

01:05:35.269 --> 01:05:38.397
So, which one of you little
scamps is the leader then?

01:05:39.106 --> 01:05:40.650
What's it to you, Granddad?

01:05:41.651 --> 01:05:42.652
Him?

01:05:43.611 --> 01:05:45.363
Looks like a bed wetter to me.

01:05:46.113 --> 01:05:48.491
You wouldn't all follow a bed
wetter, would you?

01:05:48.574 --> 01:05:49.992
I'm not a bed wetter.

01:05:50.076 --> 01:05:54.163
Sorry, I can't hear you over
the overwhelming stench of piss.

01:06:00.336 --> 01:06:04.465
So which of the rest of you think that
you could help run Alphonso Land, hmm?

01:06:05.633 --> 01:06:06.801
Too scrawny.

01:06:07.218 --> 01:06:09.679
Too ginger. A girl.

01:06:10.304 --> 01:06:13.766
Oh well.
I suppose the leader has to be me.

01:06:16.894 --> 01:06:19.105
<i>Ignore your parents.</i>

01:06:19.188 --> 01:06:20.898
<i>Forget the wrath of grown-ups.</i>

01:06:20.982 --> 01:06:25.403
<i>No rules, no homework, no bedtime.</i>

01:06:25.569 --> 01:06:28.948
<i>Welcome to Alphonso Land!</i>

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.666
How's this for camera-ready, Mum?

01:06:39.291 --> 01:06:41.377
Who's not going to amount to anything now?

01:06:42.169 --> 01:06:43.170
You dead bitch.

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.673
Oh, there you are, miss.

01:06:45.756 --> 01:06:47.550
Need you on set in five.

01:06:47.925 --> 01:06:48.926
What is this?

01:06:56.392 --> 01:06:57.935
Okay, listen up guys.

01:06:58.144 --> 01:07:02.273
We need to be ready to shoot in five.
It's not ideal but it is what it is.

01:07:02.356 --> 01:07:03.774
First up...

01:07:08.279 --> 01:07:11.323
Jennifer, that's not the outfit
I picked out for you.

01:07:11.866 --> 01:07:14.243
A spangly leotard didn't really
seem appropriate

01:07:14.326 --> 01:07:16.454
for breaking the biggest
news story in the world.

01:07:16.537 --> 01:07:19.790
It is however, the perfect attire
for the glamorous assistant

01:07:20.082 --> 01:07:21.876
for the only clown on television.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:26.464
- What?
- This weekend was to be my big comeback.

01:07:26.547 --> 01:07:30.885
I see no reason why that should change
just because the world as we know it has.

01:07:31.677 --> 01:07:33.596
Didn't you listen to Tim from Bromanz?

01:07:33.679 --> 01:07:35.806
This is urgent.
We have to tell the world.

01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:39.643
Jennifer, we've been handed
a golden opportunity here.

01:07:40.644 --> 01:07:43.898
So we have the biggest broadcasting
facility in the country

01:07:43.981 --> 01:07:46.525
and we're gonna use it
to put out a clown show?

01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:49.070
Finally, we're on the same page.

01:07:49.653 --> 01:07:51.113
Oh, this is stupid.

01:07:51.781 --> 01:07:55.576
Okay, kids, I have an important
message to get out to the world.

01:07:55.659 --> 01:07:56.952
Turn the camera over here.

01:07:57.036 --> 01:08:00.331
Put her in the tiger cage.

01:08:01.832 --> 01:08:05.086
Have you lost your mind?
We're in the middle of a global calamity.

01:08:05.169 --> 01:08:09.340
This is Y2K times 2K, and I'm the
only one who knows what's going on.

01:08:09.423 --> 01:08:10.966
You have to let me tell people.

01:08:14.887 --> 01:08:17.640
No, no, no. You can't do this.
This is my big story.

01:08:17.973 --> 01:08:20.017
My mother doesn't get to win again.

01:08:20.101 --> 01:08:22.603
How is she still winning?
We put her in the ground.

01:08:22.686 --> 01:08:24.772
There's still a way out of this, Jennifer.

01:08:24.855 --> 01:08:27.399
Just be my Debbie McGee.

01:08:28.192 --> 01:08:29.193
Aww.

01:08:29.318 --> 01:08:31.362
What in God's name are you
trying to achieve here?

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:34.365
I'll be the only game in town, Jennifer.

01:08:34.615 --> 01:08:38.202
I was canceled once before.
I lost my TV show.

01:08:38.577 --> 01:08:41.956
My celebrity friends, my
regular table at Stringfellows.

01:08:42.414 --> 01:08:44.917
Well, I'll not let them do it to me again.

01:08:45.334 --> 01:08:47.253
I'm going to create an army here.

01:08:47.419 --> 01:08:51.966
Loyal fans who will fight to keep me on
the air with their dying breaths,

01:08:52.049 --> 01:08:55.719
and I will be revenged on everyone
that betrayed me!

01:08:56.053 --> 01:08:58.264
Alphonso! Alphonso!

01:08:59.056 --> 01:09:02.059
Oh look. They're calling my name.

01:09:02.434 --> 01:09:04.895
Alphonso! Alphonso!

01:09:13.445 --> 01:09:14.488
Bye bye, Bobo.

01:09:19.285 --> 01:09:23.372
Boys and girls! Ladies and gentlemen!

01:09:23.455 --> 01:09:24.707
That's the guy!

01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:25.833
I'm back!

01:10:04.371 --> 01:10:06.916
What are you doing? This isn't Paris.

01:10:07.124 --> 01:10:09.585
Let's him go, Dean.
Let him go.

01:10:10.252 --> 01:10:12.046
He is with Satan now.

01:10:32.107 --> 01:10:34.985
I feel like I've swallowed a load of dirt.

01:10:35.361 --> 01:10:38.989
You have. You were snoring.
It was the only way to shut you up.

01:10:40.032 --> 01:10:42.868
I need a bloody drink.

01:10:42.993 --> 01:10:46.080
Well, Ken, it seems to
me we have two options.

01:10:46.622 --> 01:10:50.084
Either we drink our own piss or...

01:10:50.167 --> 01:10:52.544
we drink each other's.

01:11:02.179 --> 01:11:05.599
Come on, give me just a drop
you miserable bitch.

01:11:05.683 --> 01:11:10.354
Not in my... I've got a
bloody open mouth here.

01:11:15.943 --> 01:11:17.611
So this is a sex thing?

01:11:18.153 --> 01:11:22.616
No. We're just having...
Actually, let's go with sex thing.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.535
Mildly less embarrassing.

01:11:25.035 --> 01:11:29.081
We used to be clowns, but my
name's Janet now, and I'm a person.

01:11:30.082 --> 01:11:32.835
Well, as it happens, I'm
on the trail of a clown.

01:11:33.085 --> 01:11:36.213
I don't suppose you've heard of
The Great Alphonso?

01:11:36.588 --> 01:11:40.009
That hack. Nope, never heard of him.
Wasn't a fan.

01:11:40.175 --> 01:11:42.469
He killed my dog,
stole my life's work.

01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:46.390
- Him and his clueless journalist friend.
- What?

01:11:46.473 --> 01:11:48.851
Now she's broadcasting
a clown show from his big top

01:11:48.934 --> 01:11:51.729
with my transmitter.
Took everything from me.

01:11:52.813 --> 01:11:55.316
Swear to God, when I find her...
What's that smell?

01:11:56.358 --> 01:11:57.359
It's nothing.

01:11:57.568 --> 01:11:59.069
This doesn't make sense.

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:03.407
Jenny hates clowns...
unless she's on drugs.

01:12:04.658 --> 01:12:07.828
Alphonso must have taken her hostage
and given her drugs.

01:12:07.911 --> 01:12:09.580
Jesus Christ. Not this again.

01:12:09.663 --> 01:12:12.124
No, no, no. Fuck it.
I know where they are.

01:12:13.292 --> 01:12:15.544
Bobo couldn't save the woman he loves.

01:12:16.754 --> 01:12:18.630
But maybe Ken can.

01:12:20.966 --> 01:12:22.176
I'm coming with you.

01:12:22.885 --> 01:12:25.054
Then we're coming too!

01:12:25.137 --> 01:12:27.639
- I'm not sure we're all going to fit.
- Fine, go on.

01:12:27.723 --> 01:12:28.724
Let's ride.

01:12:36.357 --> 01:12:39.026
So where are your clothes?

01:12:39.193 --> 01:12:41.612
Ah, we burned them
as a symbolic gesture,

01:12:41.695 --> 01:12:44.073
which in retrospect
was entirely unnecessary.

01:12:44.406 --> 01:12:46.492
We can't save Jenny in our pants.

01:12:46.575 --> 01:12:50.329
We're gonna have to steal some clothes
or we'll look ridiculous.

01:12:55.876 --> 01:12:56.877
It's Jenny.

01:12:57.294 --> 01:13:01.090
Right, I'm gonna need you guys
to create a diversion. Okay?

01:13:01.465 --> 01:13:02.841
I've got this flare.

01:13:03.842 --> 01:13:05.761
Keep away from children.

01:13:06.512 --> 01:13:08.931
Why does everyone keep saying this to me?

01:13:09.223 --> 01:13:10.557
Okay, what's the plan?

01:13:11.058 --> 01:13:15.979
Okay, I'm gonna commando roll across
that field, crawl for a bit,

01:13:16.063 --> 01:13:17.648
parkour my way over the fence

01:13:17.731 --> 01:13:19.983
and take out
the first kid with one of these.

01:13:25.364 --> 01:13:27.032
And I'll say, "tough break."

01:13:27.991 --> 01:13:31.703
The second kid will come at me from
behind, and I'll give him one of these.

01:13:31.787 --> 01:13:34.039
Ah, wanker!

01:13:34.123 --> 01:13:35.582
And I'll say, um...

01:13:37.835 --> 01:13:40.379
I won't say anything there.
I'll keep it stealthy.

01:13:40.879 --> 01:13:43.090
So at that point,
it's just those two kids

01:13:43.173 --> 01:13:45.801
standing between me
and a happy ever after.

01:13:45.884 --> 01:13:49.888
So I'll jump up, grab the door frame
and give 'em a double kick. Ya! Ya!

01:13:49.972 --> 01:13:53.725
I'll say "two's company,"
or "twice to meet you."

01:13:54.643 --> 01:13:55.644
Everyone got it?

01:13:56.854 --> 01:13:57.896
Yeah.

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:02.192
Oh, by the way,
if I don't make it out there,

01:14:03.277 --> 01:14:06.530
tell the world I died with dignity.

01:14:06.905 --> 01:14:07.990
You want us to lie.

01:14:08.449 --> 01:14:11.160
No, just imply I was wearing trousers.

01:14:12.578 --> 01:14:13.579
Okay.

01:14:23.172 --> 01:14:24.923
Hey, Ken!

01:14:25.007 --> 01:14:27.593
What's a diversion?

01:14:31.805 --> 01:14:36.477
Well, well, well, looks like you've
made some new friends, Tim.

01:14:37.186 --> 01:14:38.395
We're here for the girl.

01:14:39.521 --> 01:14:42.107
Let the girl go and
no harm will come to you.

01:14:42.399 --> 01:14:43.442
She's just a girl.

01:14:43.609 --> 01:14:45.819
I'm 35, you dick.

01:14:45.903 --> 01:14:48.697
I kept your secret, Alphonso.
You didn't have to kill my dog.

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:50.073
What secret?

01:14:50.616 --> 01:14:52.826
I'm sorry about your dog,
by the way,

01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:55.871
but I do wanna get clarity,
though, on that secret.

01:14:55.954 --> 01:14:57.039
The gunge tank.

01:14:59.458 --> 01:15:02.544
It was the after party of series
three of <i>Alphonso's Fun Club.</i>

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.172
It wasn't an accident.
I saw him do it.

01:15:05.714 --> 01:15:08.008
My brother was taking
the piss out of the show.

01:15:08.091 --> 01:15:09.551
He was making jokes about it.

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:12.888
He called it Al-fuckso's Bum Club.

01:15:15.182 --> 01:15:17.935
So Alphonso drowned him in gunge,

01:15:19.061 --> 01:15:22.272
and he threatened to do the same
to me if I ever told anyone.

01:15:22.523 --> 01:15:26.735
Well, sadly for you, Tim,
it looks like you just have.

01:15:27.027 --> 01:15:30.614
Bedwetter, Ginger Twat!
Throw the others in with Jennifer.

01:15:31.114 --> 01:15:37.079
Tim here is about to experience
pie to the power of infinity.

01:15:40.707 --> 01:15:43.710
Jenny, I swore that I'd find you.

01:15:43.794 --> 01:15:47.422
- It's true. He wouldn't shut up about it.
- And now we can be together.

01:15:47.548 --> 01:15:50.592
We could start a new life!
In this cage, if needs be.

01:15:50.676 --> 01:15:53.720
- Bobo what are you talking about?
- That's the thing. I'm not Bobo any more.

01:15:53.804 --> 01:15:55.097
- I'm Ken.
- Ken.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:56.431
- Ken.
- She knows.

01:15:56.682 --> 01:15:58.350
Just normal, dependable Ken.

01:15:58.475 --> 01:15:59.476
- Ken.
- Okay.

01:16:00.686 --> 01:16:03.855
Type of bloke that wears
brown size nine shoes.

01:16:04.898 --> 01:16:06.066
Who owns a shed.

01:16:07.526 --> 01:16:11.363
Sort of bloke you could get to know
over a tepid cup of Bovril.

01:16:12.906 --> 01:16:16.159
Type of guy you could settle down with.

01:16:16.243 --> 01:16:18.328
As I say, in this cage, if needs be.

01:16:20.038 --> 01:16:22.332
Where have you guys been?

01:16:22.749 --> 01:16:26.169
On a long journey
to the center of ourselves.

01:16:27.337 --> 01:16:31.425
My name is Dean and
I'm not a clown either.

01:16:32.509 --> 01:16:35.345
In a funny way
I don't suppose I ever really was.

01:16:35.554 --> 01:16:37.472
And I'm Janet, and my thing is,

01:16:37.806 --> 01:16:40.726
when I was six I set my friends on fire.
I poured...

01:16:41.977 --> 01:16:44.605
- Oh mother of God!
- The show's about to start.

01:16:44.896 --> 01:16:50.235
Listen, that 200 pound slab of lunch meat
is trying to amass an army of children.

01:16:50.569 --> 01:16:53.697
We need to disable that transmitter
and get him off the air.

01:16:56.617 --> 01:16:59.870
<i>Hello boys and girls!</i>

01:17:00.662 --> 01:17:06.376
I am back on the TV where I belong,
and tonight for a special treat.

01:17:06.668 --> 01:17:09.087
I have an old celebrity friend.

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:12.924
Tim from Bromanz!

01:17:16.303 --> 01:17:18.388
Are... we... ready?

01:17:18.555 --> 01:17:19.973
No, no, no, no, no.

01:17:21.058 --> 01:17:23.727
Unleash hell!

01:17:53.757 --> 01:17:54.758
Stop it!

01:17:54.841 --> 01:17:56.718
He's had enough!

01:17:56.802 --> 01:17:58.220
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

01:17:58.887 --> 01:18:03.433
We're going to need him conscious
for the main event.

01:18:07.813 --> 01:18:09.815
Gunge him! Gunge him!

01:18:09.898 --> 01:18:15.237
<i>And we're going to have more celebrity
people come on this show all the time.</i>

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:20.200
<i>With your help! I want you to bring
some of those friends of mine</i>

01:18:20.534 --> 01:18:22.703
<i>who I haven't seen since I was on TV.</i>

01:18:22.786 --> 01:18:27.207
<i>If you bring this to me,
you get a big reward. Yes!</i>

01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:29.459
So come to Alphonso Land!

01:18:29.543 --> 01:18:33.964
No homework, no rules, no bedtime!

01:18:34.047 --> 01:18:38.468
<i>And anybody who tries
to stop us will get gunged!</i>

01:18:39.386 --> 01:18:41.096
Anyone!

01:18:42.222 --> 01:18:46.601
Jesus Christ. He's gonna
gunge us all to death. Oh God.

01:18:47.102 --> 01:18:48.103
Oh God.

01:18:48.812 --> 01:18:52.357
Oh God. We're next. Oh God.
This is all your fault, Bobo.

01:18:52.441 --> 01:18:53.942
I wish I'd never met you.

01:18:54.025 --> 01:18:56.862
I could be off breaking the
biggest story in the world

01:18:56.945 --> 01:18:59.406
with an unbelievably hot
burger van guy now.

01:18:59.489 --> 01:19:02.784
Instead of being stuck in
a cage with a bunch of clowns

01:19:02.951 --> 01:19:05.829
waiting to be murdered by feral children.

01:19:06.329 --> 01:19:08.331
Actually ex-clowns. But I'll shut up.

01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:10.751
Why me, Bobo?

01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:16.131
Out of all the women in the world
you could have chosen to obsess over,

01:19:16.923 --> 01:19:18.633
why did you land on me?

01:19:23.096 --> 01:19:27.642
Because you were the
first person in 15 years

01:19:28.435 --> 01:19:30.228
who made me feel good about myself.

01:19:32.731 --> 01:19:34.733
Made me feel more than just a...

01:19:36.777 --> 01:19:38.737
fat clown at a children's party.

01:19:40.655 --> 01:19:41.865
That I was important.

01:19:44.075 --> 01:19:47.287
And that I was someone
who deserved to be loved

01:19:49.956 --> 01:19:52.334
Because I threw you
a drunk fuck in a cupboard?

01:19:53.502 --> 01:19:55.712
It was long--
It was long enough to know...

01:19:58.673 --> 01:20:00.801
- I love you.
- Oh shit.

01:20:02.052 --> 01:20:03.053
Oh my God.

01:20:05.722 --> 01:20:06.890
Oh, that's bleak.

01:20:10.811 --> 01:20:14.856
Oh, oh, that's so fucking bleak.

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:19.236
God. Okay. Yeah.
No. Alphonso! Alphonso!

01:20:19.319 --> 01:20:21.321
Yes, I'm in. I give up.

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:34.835
Clown blood.

01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:36.670
It's fresh.

01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:41.591
They're close.

01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:54.354
Ah, Pegasus.

01:20:55.397 --> 01:20:56.398
My old friend.

01:21:02.445 --> 01:21:05.156
Jesus Christ, they just keep coming.

01:21:05.448 --> 01:21:06.783
We need to get outta here.

01:21:06.867 --> 01:21:10.203
There's no way we're getting past
these homicidal rug-munchers.

01:21:10.287 --> 01:21:13.039
- I think you mean rugrats.
- They're terrifying.

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:15.041
One of them smokes a pipe.

01:21:15.417 --> 01:21:16.877
Alphonso was wrong you know,

01:21:17.752 --> 01:21:19.504
about the Jugglenaut.

01:21:20.171 --> 01:21:23.300
It doesn't need clowns who
are willing to die for one another.

01:21:23.425 --> 01:21:25.969
It just needs clowns
who have nothing to live for.

01:21:26.052 --> 01:21:27.846
- What?
- Well think about it.

01:21:28.555 --> 01:21:30.056
These kids like violence.

01:21:30.348 --> 01:21:33.977
They like danger, they like
watching people hurt themselves.

01:21:35.770 --> 01:21:40.317
If we can pull off a trick like that, we
might be able to distract them long enough

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:46.323
to do one last decent thing with our lives
and take that prick Alphonso off the air.

01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:54.205
Everyone dreams of dying
doing what they love.

01:22:00.211 --> 01:22:02.923
And since that's not an option for us,

01:22:08.053 --> 01:22:09.679
what say we go out clowning?

01:22:13.308 --> 01:22:19.189
Oi! Bedwetter. Gather your men.
I've got something to show you.

01:22:19.272 --> 01:22:20.273
What is it?

01:22:20.899 --> 01:22:22.067
It's a clown show.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.444
We've just seen one.

01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:28.531
Not like this.

01:22:33.536 --> 01:22:36.164
I knew you would come
around eventually, Jennifer,

01:22:36.247 --> 01:22:40.543
now for a moment there,
you nearly chose the wrong team.

01:22:42.337 --> 01:22:45.966
It's a brave new world, Jennifer,
and it's ours for the taking.

01:22:46.633 --> 01:22:50.929
Me as warlord slash
global clown Emperor

01:22:51.721 --> 01:22:55.809
and you beside me as my
bikini-clad assistant.

01:22:56.309 --> 01:22:57.852
Ah, thank you Shakira.

01:22:58.311 --> 01:23:01.064
Yes.
I mean, sounds good.

01:23:02.023 --> 01:23:03.858
Have you got anything to drink?

01:23:04.150 --> 01:23:07.404
Jenny, do wombles shit
on Wimbledon Common?

01:23:07.779 --> 01:23:08.780
Hmm?

01:23:10.073 --> 01:23:12.075
- Drinks cabinet's over there.
- Great.

01:23:12.158 --> 01:23:15.328
I will make us a...

01:23:16.621 --> 01:23:18.999
vodka and...

01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:20.542
scotch.

01:23:20.625 --> 01:23:24.295
Ah, a Kilted Russian: how very agreeable.

01:23:40.395 --> 01:23:42.105
Hello, boys and girls.

01:23:43.106 --> 01:23:45.191
My name's Bobo,

01:23:45.275 --> 01:23:51.406
and these are my friends, Pepe and Funzo.

01:23:51.823 --> 01:23:54.909
Who likes balloons?

01:23:56.119 --> 01:23:57.162
I do.

01:24:03.418 --> 01:24:04.419
Oh.

01:24:06.171 --> 01:24:08.465
Ah, this was a mistake.

01:24:08.882 --> 01:24:10.759
- What was that?
- Oh, nothing.

01:24:10.842 --> 01:24:14.179
You know what kids are like
when they're drunk on power.

01:24:15.847 --> 01:24:18.058
A toast to good friends.

01:24:18.141 --> 01:24:19.142
Ah, Jenny.

01:24:19.559 --> 01:24:21.352
I hate for you to embarrass yourself

01:24:21.436 --> 01:24:26.441
in front of the Rotary Club Toastmaster
General in 1992, 1993, and 1995.

01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:28.943
I'd better do this. Hmm.

01:24:29.694 --> 01:24:34.491
Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished
guests, Princess Michael of Kent.

01:24:34.949 --> 01:24:40.246
An occasion such as this always calls for
one of the greatest and indeed longest

01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:42.707
poems of the last six centuries.

01:24:43.917 --> 01:24:46.419
Okay. Screw the crowd work.
Skip to the big finish.

01:24:46.544 --> 01:24:49.923
Boys and girls, I present to you

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:53.510
the Jugglenaut!

01:24:55.345 --> 01:24:57.013
Pepe, hup!

01:25:00.016 --> 01:25:02.936
I can't. I can't do it.
I'm not good enough.

01:25:03.019 --> 01:25:04.938
I never have been.

01:25:05.063 --> 01:25:06.815
I'll never be a DuCoquesman.

01:25:08.024 --> 01:25:10.151
I don't need you to be a DuCoquesman.

01:25:10.235 --> 01:25:13.822
I don't care what some dusty French
wank merchant thought of you.

01:25:13.905 --> 01:25:16.449
I just need you to
climb on to my fat shoulders

01:25:16.533 --> 01:25:18.785
and be paralyzed with fear, please.

01:25:22.789 --> 01:25:25.250
Okay, I can do that.

01:25:31.756 --> 01:25:34.050
Funzo, hup!

01:25:34.342 --> 01:25:37.512
I don't want to be Funzo.
I don't want to scare anyone.

01:25:37.887 --> 01:25:40.390
Funzo, Janet.
It doesn't matter what you call yourself.

01:25:40.473 --> 01:25:42.725
Being scary is who you are.

01:25:42.809 --> 01:25:44.269
You were born to do this,

01:25:44.352 --> 01:25:48.815
and I'll be honest with you, some of these
kids could do with a decent fucking scare.

01:25:51.985 --> 01:25:52.986
Oh God.

01:25:53.570 --> 01:25:54.571
Oh Jesus.

01:26:39.324 --> 01:26:41.117
Three, two, one!

01:26:51.961 --> 01:26:52.962
Pepe!

01:26:53.838 --> 01:26:56.299
Hup... hup... hup...

01:27:11.356 --> 01:27:12.857
Funzo, grab the transmitter!

01:27:15.401 --> 01:27:19.781
I can hear it!
The laughter! It's like thunder!

01:27:24.077 --> 01:27:26.579
"Since last she was a wee--"
Wait.

01:27:27.330 --> 01:27:29.707
Is that children enjoying themselves?

01:27:30.458 --> 01:27:32.126
That's impossible.
I'm still here.

01:27:32.835 --> 01:27:34.379
Let's have your drink first.

01:27:34.462 --> 01:27:38.675
<i>♪ I like to drink with Alphonso.
Alphonso is my mate ♪</i>

01:27:38.758 --> 01:27:41.803
<i>♪ And when I drink with Alphonso,
He gets it down in eight ♪</i>

01:27:42.303 --> 01:27:44.472
Jesus Christ, okay, fuck it!

01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:47.058
Show's over!

01:28:00.613 --> 01:28:03.700
- Funzo!
- No!

01:28:08.204 --> 01:28:13.376
- You killed our friend.
- Our best friend, you monster.

01:28:14.085 --> 01:28:16.004
An eye for an eye, Booboo.

01:28:16.212 --> 01:28:17.755
And now it's your turn.

01:28:24.804 --> 01:28:27.181
We just want Funzo.
Give her over now

01:28:27.265 --> 01:28:30.059
and I promise you all a
quick and painless death.

01:28:30.184 --> 01:28:31.978
Too late. He's already killed her.

01:28:32.312 --> 01:28:35.356
Yeah. Just a few minutes ago.
You couldn't have been closer.

01:28:36.107 --> 01:28:37.108
What?

01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:39.777
Well that is an anti-climax.

01:28:39.986 --> 01:28:42.530
I mean, we traveled all
this way fueled by revenge.

01:28:45.241 --> 01:28:48.953
- You're gonna have to give us a minute.
- This is bloody typical.

01:28:49.037 --> 01:28:50.830
- Bloody typical!
- Okay, okay.

01:28:50.913 --> 01:28:52.248
We have no time for this.

01:28:52.332 --> 01:28:54.625
I need you to be more
solution orientated now,

01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:57.086
rather than focusing on problems, okay?

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.715
- It's a tiny motorbike.
- No, no.

01:29:03.885 --> 01:29:06.888
Yeah. Great. Great.
Let's explain that to them, then.

01:29:10.308 --> 01:29:12.769
Okay. So we've noticed
that you've got a gunge pit

01:29:12.852 --> 01:29:15.313
and we've always
wanted to try one of those,

01:29:15.396 --> 01:29:18.149
so I think we're just
gonna murder you all with that.

01:29:18.232 --> 01:29:19.609
Tie their hands.

01:29:19.692 --> 01:29:21.944
Why does no one seem to be...
Stop it!

01:29:22.904 --> 01:29:25.323
Turn around. Don't tie me up.
I have money.

01:29:25.531 --> 01:29:27.950
Well, Bitcoin.
It's yours if you let me go.

01:29:48.846 --> 01:29:50.640
My ear! My other ear!

01:29:54.852 --> 01:29:56.979
Bobo! The transmitter!

01:29:57.438 --> 01:29:59.190
The transmitter!

01:30:23.464 --> 01:30:25.758
There's only one way to settle this, Alphonso.

01:30:25.842 --> 01:30:28.427
I will crush you with my bulk.

01:30:28.511 --> 01:30:31.264
I have seen off many rivals.

01:31:37.872 --> 01:31:40.791
Who's the walrus now, Alphonso, you dick?

01:31:40.875 --> 01:31:44.170
- Who's the fucking walrus now?
- You are.

01:31:44.670 --> 01:31:46.756
I've beaten you in every way.

01:31:47.423 --> 01:31:50.468
As a clown, as a man.

01:31:52.511 --> 01:31:54.931
Both ways!

01:31:56.474 --> 01:31:58.809
Do you know I used to look up to you?

01:31:58.893 --> 01:32:01.103
You were one of the
reasons I became a clown.

01:32:01.187 --> 01:32:02.897
I'm so sorry.

01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:05.608
Oh, I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:32:06.817 --> 01:32:08.611
Because I'm the bigger man.

01:32:10.112 --> 01:32:13.616
- And the better clown.
- Bromanz forever!

01:32:16.953 --> 01:32:19.914
Jesus Christ, Tim.
I was just doing a whole thing.

01:32:22.583 --> 01:32:25.044
And I should have done that 30 years ago.

01:32:27.421 --> 01:32:31.259
Okay Funzo, you've earned your spot.
We'll see you on the strip.

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:36.597
- You okay, Janet?
- Of course. Nothing bad happened to me.

01:32:36.889 --> 01:32:38.891
Nothing bad ever happens to Funzo.

01:32:47.441 --> 01:32:48.859
We should probably help him.

01:32:48.943 --> 01:32:50.444
- No.
- Okay!

01:33:08.754 --> 01:33:12.008
Okay. It's all looking good.

01:33:15.094 --> 01:33:16.095
Fantastic.

01:33:18.097 --> 01:33:19.348
Okay.
We're all set.

01:33:20.057 --> 01:33:21.058
You ready?

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.186
I was born ready, Bobo.
It's in the blood.

01:33:25.229 --> 01:33:29.108
Going live in Five! Four! Three!

01:33:29.942 --> 01:33:32.486
- Are you gonna do it wearing that?
- Oh shit.

01:33:32.611 --> 01:33:33.738
Good evening.

01:33:33.821 --> 01:33:37.950
<i>I'm Jenny Malone reporting
the truth to the world.</i>

01:33:38.034 --> 01:33:42.038
I realize we've all been through a lot,
but what I'm about to tell you

01:33:42.121 --> 01:33:46.876
should explain how we got here and how
we are going to survive this together.

01:33:49.337 --> 01:33:54.717
<i>In 1967, the CIA, in conjunction with
the teenage Hillary Clinton,</i>

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:57.053
<i>began a series of experiments on the sun.</i>

01:33:57.219 --> 01:33:59.472
<i>And two days ago, under the instruction</i>

01:33:59.555 --> 01:34:04.268
of a sinister cabal of shapeshifting,
pedophilic lizard people,

01:34:04.352 --> 01:34:06.979
<i>they unleashed
a secret weapon on the world.</i>

01:34:07.813 --> 01:34:10.733
<i>- Operation: Solar Flare.</i>
- I've been saying it for... yes!

01:34:10.983 --> 01:34:14.153
<i>A plan to enslave humanity,
harvest our DNA,</i>

01:34:14.236 --> 01:34:17.073
<i>and sell it to the Chinese
chemtrail industry.</i>

01:34:17.531 --> 01:34:19.408
Over the next three to four hours,

01:34:19.492 --> 01:34:21.410
I will show you--

01:34:21.869 --> 01:34:24.413
Irrefutable evidence
of John F. Kennedy's...

01:34:26.415 --> 01:34:27.958
John F. Kennedy...

01:34:34.465 --> 01:34:36.967
- What are you doing?
- What's going on then?

01:34:37.927 --> 01:34:41.263
- Is it-- is it over?
- Everything's turning back on.

01:34:43.182 --> 01:34:45.142
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

01:34:47.812 --> 01:34:49.522
Oh my gosh.

01:34:50.856 --> 01:34:54.777
And although Áras an Uachtaráin was
completely obliterated, the president was

01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:59.782
<i>eventually carried to safety by Brazilian
burger technician Gustavo Musculos.</i>

01:35:01.742 --> 01:35:04.453
Elsewhere, chaotic scenes
played out across the nation

01:35:04.537 --> 01:35:06.872
with a series of localized
electrical blackouts

01:35:06.956 --> 01:35:09.667
believed to have been caused
by a massive power surge

01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:12.920
at a recent concert by
country singer Garth Brooks.

01:35:13.462 --> 01:35:14.880
<i>May he rest in peace.</i>

01:35:16.465 --> 01:35:18.342
Then there was this bizarre broadcast

01:35:18.426 --> 01:35:21.971
<i>by the daughter of celebrated news
correspondent Deborah Malone,</i>

01:35:22.054 --> 01:35:25.182
<i>Two days ago,
under the instruction of a sinister cabal</i>

01:35:25.307 --> 01:35:27.893
<i>of shapeshifting pedophilic
lizard people--</i>

01:35:27.977 --> 01:35:31.605
<i>I think we can all agree her late
mother would be massively disappointed.</i>

01:35:31.689 --> 01:35:34.608
Next up, clown funerals.
They're like buses, aren't they?

01:35:34.692 --> 01:35:37.778
You wait ages for one and then
two come along all at once.

01:35:37.903 --> 01:35:39.655
Nineties has-been clown,

01:35:39.905 --> 01:35:43.451
<i>the late Alphonso
has popped his giant clogs</i>

01:35:43.534 --> 01:35:46.871
and is in a tiny little car
on his way to heaven right now.

01:35:54.211 --> 01:35:56.172
Thanks for helping us out, Jenny.

01:35:56.255 --> 01:36:00.176
Yes. Thank you so much for letting us
bury DuCoque in your mother's grave.

01:36:00.259 --> 01:36:03.471
Don't mention it.
She hated clowns and the French.

01:36:11.187 --> 01:36:14.064
When we first hooked up
at your niece's birthday,

01:36:15.232 --> 01:36:17.485
did you ever imagine we'd end up here?

01:36:19.361 --> 01:36:20.362
No.

01:36:22.281 --> 01:36:23.574
No, of course not.

01:36:24.992 --> 01:36:25.993
Yeah.

01:36:26.202 --> 01:36:27.244
Me neither.

01:36:31.123 --> 01:36:33.918
Oh, what the fuck are you doing?

01:36:34.793 --> 01:36:37.296
I just thought we'd been on this journey.

01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:40.216
I vanquished the other male.

01:36:42.218 --> 01:36:43.636
Did I read the moment wrong?

01:36:44.678 --> 01:36:50.059
We are secretly burying a rotting
clown corpse in my mother's grave.

01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:54.063
What is it about this moment
that you think is sexy?

01:36:57.691 --> 01:36:59.276
- The sun?
- The sun. Oh.

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:00.778
It's kind of sexy.

01:37:01.779 --> 01:37:03.864
It's like a big, red
clown nose in the sky.

01:37:03.948 --> 01:37:05.449
Goodbye, Bobo.

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:07.201
Forever this time.

01:37:07.868 --> 01:37:09.912
- Yeah, but what about...
- No! Forever.

01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:13.958
Well, what now?

01:37:15.417 --> 01:37:18.462
I hear there's a prime spot
going on the main strip.

01:37:18.671 --> 01:37:21.257
You could get your DuCoque
out on the street!

01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:31.850
Do you know, I used to blame
Alphonso for my lack of success.

01:37:34.853 --> 01:37:39.567
But now that he's gone,
I can't see anything getting in my way.

01:37:41.151 --> 01:37:42.945
Let's do it!

01:37:44.530 --> 01:37:47.741
Well, it looks like we're
gonna need some business cards.

01:37:48.158 --> 01:37:50.869
- We need a name first.
- We have a name!

01:37:50.953 --> 01:37:55.040
- We are not calling ourselves that.
- It's too late!

01:38:07.219 --> 01:38:09.847
<i>Where are the clowns of yesteryear?</i>

01:38:13.017 --> 01:38:19.732
<i>Where are the red and white faces
and the absolutely enormous trousers?</i>

01:38:21.483 --> 01:38:27.448
<i>I understand that the
world is different now,</i>

01:38:30.492 --> 01:38:33.078
<i>but I miss the good old days.</i>

01:38:36.624 --> 01:38:40.169
<i>Where are the children who are
happy with simple pleasures?</i>

01:38:43.130 --> 01:38:45.007
<i>Not Serbian Pornography.</i>

01:38:46.425 --> 01:38:47.885
<i>Life is bullshit.</i>

01:38:50.346 --> 01:38:51.889
<i>I hate young people.</i>

01:38:53.724 --> 01:38:55.184
<i>What a bunch of pricks.</i>

01:38:56.852 --> 01:39:01.065
<i>They pull at my nose and call me a tramp.</i>

01:39:03.275 --> 01:39:04.485
<i>Here is the duck.</i>

01:39:06.111 --> 01:39:08.238
<i>With his tiny briefcase.</i>

01:39:09.698 --> 01:39:11.659
<i>He checks his list,</i>

01:39:12.826 --> 01:39:14.662
<i>and adjusts his glasses.</i>

01:39:16.664 --> 01:39:19.041
<i>My name is there.</i>

01:39:20.501 --> 01:39:22.586
<i>There's no hardship.</i>

01:39:23.671 --> 01:39:28.884
<i>I will go with
him in his little business suit</i>

01:39:29.927 --> 01:39:34.098
<i>Goodbye dreadful world,
goodbye cruel life.</i>

01:39:35.099 --> 01:39:40.813
<i>This is my final act, the last ritual.</i>

01:39:47.277 --> 01:39:49.029
<i>Life is not rosy.</i>

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:52.908
<i>Whatever Edith Piaf says.</i>

01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:36.011


01:41:36.261 --> 01:41:40.516
<i>You are listening to the audio
book of</i> Life of Pie, a Clown Odyssey,

01:41:41.099 --> 01:41:47.189
<i>written and narrated by the Great
Alphonso. Chapter One. Beginnings.</i>

01:41:49.733 --> 01:41:52.528
<i>I was a born clown despite
a difficult childhood.</i>

01:41:53.153 --> 01:41:56.406
<i>I was ten years old
when the bullying first started.</i>

01:41:57.074 --> 01:42:01.662
<i>At its height, I must have been
bullying 20 or 30 children a day.</i>

01:42:02.371 --> 01:42:06.750
<i>I didn't know at the time, but
this was the perfect preparation</i>

01:42:07.209 --> 01:42:09.419
<i>for a career in television.</i>
