Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad...

00:10.254 --> 00:12.155
- He sees something in me.
- Like what?

00:12.275 --> 00:15.236
Loyalty.
And maybe you got it for the wrong guy.

00:15.356 --> 00:18.492
There's just one thing you and me
have to talk about. What's this?

00:18.612 --> 00:19.527
This was you?

00:19.647 --> 00:22.608
- Where is Gus?
- Walter, you will never gonna see him again.

00:22.728 --> 00:24.811
I'll do it. I'll kill him.

00:24.931 --> 00:28.443
What are Gustavo Fring's fingerprints
doing in Gale Boetticher's apartment?

00:32.113 --> 00:33.314
Are we done?

00:33.349 --> 00:34.550
No, now listen, I, uh--

00:34.584 --> 00:35.619
This attack
on my brother-in-law,

00:35.653 --> 00:37.755
I don't-- I don't know
what it means.

00:37.789 --> 00:39.658
Please...

00:41.127 --> 00:43.762
I fear for my family.

00:43.796 --> 00:46.364
I'm sure they'll be fine.

00:46.398 --> 00:48.999
I am told the assassin
that survived

00:49.033 --> 00:50.300
is gravely injured.

00:50.334 --> 00:52.569
It's doubtful he'll live.

00:52.603 --> 00:55.904
Now thank me and shake my hand.

00:57.909 --> 01:00.913
Uh, thank you.
Thank you again.

01:00.947 --> 01:02.447
You're quite welcome,
Mr. White.

01:09.826 --> 01:12.062
What's happening?

01:12.096 --> 01:13.096
The time?

01:13.131 --> 01:15.165
8:43.

01:15.199 --> 01:17.067
Time of death, 20:43.

01:18.302 --> 01:20.603
Burn in hell,
you piece of shit.

01:27.010 --> 01:30.613
<i>One suspected gunman</i>
<i>died at the scene.</i>

01:30.647 --> 01:32.214
<i>The second succumbed</i>

01:32.248 --> 01:35.183

02:00.414 --> 02:02.316
I can give you highlights.

02:03.685 --> 02:05.853
Your nephews grew impatient.

02:05.888 --> 02:07.255
They continue to press me

02:07.289 --> 02:09.556
for my permission
to kill Walter White.

02:09.591 --> 02:11.325
When I wouldn't give it,

02:11.360 --> 02:14.995
they settled instead
for DEA agent Schrader.

02:15.030 --> 02:19.033
Their phone call was
placed to Agent Schrader

02:19.068 --> 02:20.401
moments before the attack,

02:20.435 --> 02:23.071
thus giving him the upper hand.

02:23.105 --> 02:26.274
Marco was shot in the face
and died instantly.

02:26.309 --> 02:29.577
Leonel lingered
for several hours.

02:30.812 --> 02:34.081
The warning call
to the DEA agent--

02:34.116 --> 02:37.419
Juan Bolsa may have some insight

02:37.453 --> 02:39.521
into who placed it.

02:39.556 --> 02:42.224
But yesterday, the <i>federales</i>
were at his hacienda,

02:42.258 --> 02:45.028
and in the confusion,
Juan was shot dead.

02:46.030 --> 02:48.332
An accident, perhaps.

02:48.366 --> 02:52.436
A mistake made by his own men,

02:52.471 --> 02:54.839
though we may never know.

02:54.873 --> 02:58.609
At any rate, I thought
you should hear from me.

03:08.052 --> 03:11.888
This is what comes
of blood for blood, Hector.

03:13.757 --> 03:15.992
<i>Sangre por sangre.</i>

04:05.479 --> 04:07.013
So is this the loud one?

04:09.817 --> 04:11.151
What?

04:11.185 --> 04:13.287
I can never remember.

04:13.321 --> 04:17.491
Is this the loud machine
with the magnets?

04:17.524 --> 04:20.761
No. This is
the PET/CT scan.

04:20.795 --> 04:23.396
Positron emission tomography.

04:25.533 --> 04:32.104
They pair that with the computed
X-ray tomography.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.542
Quiet. No magnets.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.911
Right. Okay.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.513
Yeah, thanks.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.384
I'm still pretty new at this.

04:44.418 --> 04:47.454
I mean, one minute
I'm starting a new business.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.556
My wife and I are thinking
about having kids.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.125
Walk into a doctor's office,
and suddenly, boom--

04:53.194 --> 04:55.929
Life as I know it--
Excuse me.

04:55.964 --> 04:59.366
Yes. I'm-- I'm waiting
to hear a progress report

04:59.400 --> 05:01.234
on that thing we discussed.

05:01.269 --> 05:02.769
So call me.

05:06.874 --> 05:10.376
Anyway, so for me, that's been
the biggest wake-up call--

05:10.411 --> 05:13.413
letting go, giving up control.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.981
It's like they say--

05:15.016 --> 05:17.651
you know, man plans,
and God laughs.

05:17.685 --> 05:22.590
That is such bullshit.

05:22.624 --> 05:24.358
Excuse me?

05:24.392 --> 05:27.729
Never give up control.

05:27.763 --> 05:31.466
Live life on your own terms.

05:31.501 --> 05:33.669
Yeah. No. I get
what you're saying.

05:33.703 --> 05:36.939
But-- But, uh,
cancer's cancer, so--

05:36.973 --> 05:38.840
Oh, to hell with your cancer.

05:38.874 --> 05:42.076
I've been living with cancer
for the better part of a year.

05:42.111 --> 05:44.278
Right from the start,
it's a death sentence.

05:44.313 --> 05:46.079
It's what they keep telling me.

05:46.114 --> 05:47.981
Well, guess what.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.551
Every life comes
with a death sentence.

05:51.586 --> 05:56.089
So every few months, I come
in here for my regular scan,

05:56.123 --> 06:00.026
knowing full well
that one of these times--

06:00.060 --> 06:02.161
hell, maybe even today--

06:03.864 --> 06:06.532
I'm going to hear some bad news.

06:06.567 --> 06:11.071
But until then, who's in charge?

06:11.106 --> 06:12.339
Me.

06:15.511 --> 06:17.645
That's how I live my life.

06:35.700 --> 06:38.401
This residue here
is why we descale

06:38.436 --> 06:39.670
with cool water
from the walk-in

06:39.704 --> 06:41.138
and not water
from the tap, remember?

06:41.172 --> 06:42.606
Yeah.
Do it again, please.

06:46.110 --> 06:47.310
Pollos Hermanos,

06:47.345 --> 06:49.112
where something delicious
is always cooking.

06:51.149 --> 06:53.083
Yes, detective.

07:20.311 --> 07:22.346
Gustavo, thanks for coming in.

07:22.380 --> 07:23.647
My pleasure.
How's Kathi?

07:23.682 --> 07:25.349
Much better, thank you.

07:25.383 --> 07:27.251
And you know Hank Schrader.

07:27.285 --> 07:28.319
Ah, yes, indeed.

07:28.353 --> 07:29.520
And Steve Gomez.

07:29.554 --> 07:31.188
How was your meal?

07:31.222 --> 07:32.656
Agent Schrader and I had a chance

07:32.690 --> 07:35.125
to catch up in one of my restaurants
a few days ago.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.393
I'd eat there every day,

07:36.428 --> 07:37.761
but I wouldn't
fit through the door.

07:37.796 --> 07:39.997
Well, should we get started?
Yeah.

07:41.433 --> 07:43.467
I'd like to record
this conversation,

07:43.501 --> 07:45.069
if that's okay.
Of course.

07:49.040 --> 07:53.444
The DEA is working
on an investigation

07:53.478 --> 07:55.146
which may overlap with my own,

07:55.180 --> 07:57.214
so I've asked them
to sit in with us today.

07:57.249 --> 07:58.582
Gus, we all appreciate

07:58.616 --> 08:00.451
your coming in here
to talk to us,

08:00.485 --> 08:03.554
but you have the right to have
an attorney present also.

08:03.589 --> 08:06.958
Oh, well, I can't see how
that would be necessary.

08:06.992 --> 08:09.193
But then again I have
no idea why I'm here.

08:09.227 --> 08:10.828
So you wish to continue?

08:10.862 --> 08:12.930
Please.
I'm very anxious

08:12.964 --> 08:16.000
to find out what this
is all about.

08:16.034 --> 08:19.770
Sir, your fingerprints
were found at a crime scene.

08:19.805 --> 08:21.305
Really?

08:21.340 --> 08:23.107
That's surprising.

08:23.142 --> 08:26.077
A drug-related homicide.

08:31.384 --> 08:33.586
Gale Boetticher's apartment.

08:38.293 --> 08:40.126
So you knew the victim.

08:44.732 --> 08:49.304
15 years ago, I established
a chemistry scholarship at UNM.

08:49.338 --> 08:52.474
I named it after
Maximino Arsiniega,

08:52.509 --> 08:54.710
a dear friend of mine
who died too young.

08:54.744 --> 08:57.446
Gale was a recipient
of this scholarship.

08:57.480 --> 09:01.850
He was, uh, perhaps
one of three dozen.

09:01.884 --> 09:03.985
I see.

09:04.019 --> 09:08.289
And Mr. Boetticher
graduated in...

09:08.323 --> 09:10.558
1999.

09:10.592 --> 09:11.726
That sounds right.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.627
And you kept in regular
contact with him

09:13.661 --> 09:14.794
over all this time?

09:14.829 --> 09:16.463
Oh, no. I hadn't
seen Gale for years

09:16.497 --> 09:19.165
until I ran into him
a few weeks ago.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.667
Ran into him where?

09:20.701 --> 09:22.069
At the restaurant.

09:22.103 --> 09:26.039
Uh, well, "ran into"
isn't quite accurate,

09:26.074 --> 09:27.307
as I assume he came by

09:27.341 --> 09:28.808
to re-establish
contact with me.

09:28.843 --> 09:31.344
We caught up briefly.

09:31.378 --> 09:32.678
He invited me to dinner
the following night,

09:32.713 --> 09:34.113
and I accepted.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.752
It was, uh, perhaps a week later

09:38.787 --> 09:40.120
I read about him in the paper.

09:40.155 --> 09:41.255
Drug related, you said?

09:41.289 --> 09:43.691
It's a good possibility.

09:43.725 --> 09:45.593
The paper made
no mention of that.

09:45.628 --> 09:49.197
I assumed that it was
a random crime.

09:49.232 --> 09:50.499
So after years with no contact,

09:50.533 --> 09:52.535
he shows up in your restaurant,

09:52.569 --> 09:54.704
remakes your acquaintance,

09:54.739 --> 09:55.772
and invites you to dinner?

09:55.807 --> 09:56.873
Yeah, he wanted money.

09:56.908 --> 09:58.141
Gale Boetticher
asked you for money?

09:58.176 --> 10:00.110
He didn't come right
out and say that.

10:00.144 --> 10:01.411
He spoke in terms

10:01.446 --> 10:04.648
of a vague investment
opportunity,

10:04.682 --> 10:06.483
but it was my suspicion, yes,

10:06.517 --> 10:08.785
as to why he invited me
into his home.

10:08.819 --> 10:11.888
He was a very talented chemist,

10:11.922 --> 10:14.224
but for reasons
I never understood,

10:14.258 --> 10:17.660
he was more interested
in taking shortcuts

10:17.695 --> 10:19.829
than what would
or could have been

10:19.864 --> 10:21.531
a very promising career.

10:21.565 --> 10:23.999
But personal shortcomings
notwithstanding,

10:24.034 --> 10:26.334
he was a warm, gentle person,

10:26.369 --> 10:28.837
and I thought a lot of him.

10:30.672 --> 10:33.407
At any rate, I, uh,

10:33.441 --> 10:35.075
declined his business offer,

10:35.109 --> 10:38.545
and, after what was
a very pleasant meal, left.

10:38.579 --> 10:41.048
Can you tell us where you were

10:41.082 --> 10:43.450
on the night of Wednesday
the 23rd

10:43.484 --> 10:44.718
at around 8 p.m.?

10:44.752 --> 10:46.854
Not an accusation,
just a question.

10:46.888 --> 10:49.156
Oh, I understand.
Let's see.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.393
23rd.

10:53.428 --> 10:54.728
Ah.

10:54.763 --> 10:57.432
I was at a fundraiser
at Presbyterian Hospital.

10:57.466 --> 10:59.867
I was there from 7 to about 10.

11:04.473 --> 11:05.874
Anyone else?

11:09.279 --> 11:10.446
Uh, sorry, yeah.

11:10.481 --> 11:12.415
Just, uh, just one other thing.

11:12.449 --> 11:15.519
Uh, is Gustavo Fring
your real name?

11:17.722 --> 11:19.123
Is it my real name?

11:19.157 --> 11:22.760
I know you're a Chilean national,

11:22.794 --> 11:26.764
but there are no records
of you ever living there.

11:26.798 --> 11:29.032
Really?

11:29.067 --> 11:30.567
I mean, records show

11:30.602 --> 11:34.471
that you immigrated
to Mexico in 1986,

11:34.505 --> 11:35.939
and then,
a couple of years later,

11:35.973 --> 11:38.608
you were granted an entry visa
to the United States.

11:38.643 --> 11:41.511
But there's no record
of Gustavo Fring

11:41.546 --> 11:44.815
ever having existed in Chile,

11:44.849 --> 11:48.052
which I find--
I don't know-- uh, strange.

11:48.086 --> 11:50.621
Well, really, it isn't.

11:50.655 --> 11:53.257
General Pinochet's
government was guilty

11:53.291 --> 11:54.491
of a great many sins.

11:54.525 --> 11:56.426
First and foremost were
his human rights abuses.

11:56.461 --> 11:59.430
But it was also
notoriously unreliable

11:59.464 --> 12:00.497
at keeping records.

12:01.799 --> 12:04.234
I'm sure, if you keep
digging, you'll find me.

12:07.406 --> 12:09.573
Okay.
I think that's it, Gus.

12:09.608 --> 12:10.675
Uh, thank you.

12:10.709 --> 12:13.078
I hope that I was
of some small help.

12:13.112 --> 12:15.513
You were, absolutely.
Thank you.

12:15.547 --> 12:16.547
You're very welcome.

12:16.582 --> 12:18.515
Good to see you again.

12:18.550 --> 12:20.150
Oh, no. No, please, please.
Thank you.

12:20.185 --> 12:21.185
Thanks.

12:26.424 --> 12:27.490
Gentlemen.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.658
So.. Are we buying?

12:51.898 --> 12:53.232
This thing with his name--

12:53.266 --> 12:54.466
what are you thinking there?

12:54.501 --> 12:57.136
Sure, the record keeping
in South America

12:57.171 --> 12:58.237
is hit or miss.

12:58.272 --> 13:00.340
I mean, we run into that
all the time, right?

13:00.374 --> 13:02.142
We usually find something.

13:02.177 --> 13:05.245
I mean, before '86,
this guy's a ghost.

13:05.279 --> 13:07.147
If the State Department
wasn't satisfied with his records,

13:07.181 --> 13:08.348
they wouldn't have
naturalized him.

13:08.382 --> 13:09.583
Well, maybe,

13:09.617 --> 13:12.052
but he immigrated
from Mexico in '89.

13:12.087 --> 13:14.689
You know, the state just wasn't
as tough on background checks

13:14.723 --> 13:15.856
pre-9/11.

13:15.890 --> 13:17.825
Regardless, I don't know
what this has to do

13:17.859 --> 13:18.959
with the case at hand.

13:18.994 --> 13:20.361
I was definitely curious

13:20.395 --> 13:22.930
when his prints show up
at Boetticher's apartment,

13:22.964 --> 13:25.366
but for me, the scholarship
thing explains it.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.735
Well, I'll admit
to a certain degree of bias.

13:27.769 --> 13:31.071
This man has been
a longtime friend of DEA,

13:31.106 --> 13:34.007
but that being said, uh...

13:34.042 --> 13:35.876
I thought his story was credible.

13:35.910 --> 13:38.712
Well, I agree. I think
it was a good story.

13:38.746 --> 13:41.181
Still, why are we hearing it now?

13:41.216 --> 13:42.316
What do you mean?

13:42.350 --> 13:44.118
Well,
like you said, he's a--

13:44.152 --> 13:47.287
this man's a big
law enforcement booster.

13:47.322 --> 13:49.156
One day he's reading a newspaper

13:49.190 --> 13:51.458
and sees that somebody
he just had dinner with,

13:51.493 --> 13:54.061
somebody he thought
a lot of, was murdered.

13:54.095 --> 13:57.331
He reads this, and he
doesn't make a phone call?

13:57.365 --> 14:00.901
Doesn't call you or one
of his other cop friends

14:00.935 --> 14:03.771
to share his connection
with the case

14:03.805 --> 14:05.872
or ask about the investigation.

14:05.907 --> 14:08.308
We can't predicate
a criminal investigation

14:08.342 --> 14:12.244
on a person
not making phone calls.

14:13.313 --> 14:14.847
What do you think, Tim?

14:14.881 --> 14:19.117
Well, I want to follow up
on the scholarship, the alibi.

14:19.151 --> 14:22.486
But my overall impression?
I believed him.

14:32.597 --> 14:35.566
Nice touch. Bird bath.

14:37.369 --> 14:39.035
Hey, tiger.
How's it hanging?

14:39.070 --> 14:40.203
Good.

14:42.073 --> 14:45.142
Yeah. So, very nice.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.711
What's the damage?

14:47.745 --> 14:49.213
1,200 a month.

14:49.247 --> 14:51.081
I did a lot of researching
for this neighborhood.

14:51.116 --> 14:52.449
It's a pretty good deal.

14:52.484 --> 14:54.585
You kidding me?
That's a great deal.

14:54.619 --> 14:57.121
Uh, speaking of which, ahem.

14:57.155 --> 14:59.323
That's for the week,

14:59.357 --> 15:00.858
plus there's a little
extra in there

15:00.892 --> 15:03.160
for any move-related
incidentals.

15:03.195 --> 15:04.361
Thank you.

15:04.396 --> 15:07.097
Hey, champ, how's the new school?

15:07.132 --> 15:08.799
Good.

15:08.833 --> 15:10.468
I loved school
when I was your age.

15:10.502 --> 15:12.336
Seesaws, story time,

15:12.371 --> 15:13.904
chasing girls with sticks.

15:13.939 --> 15:15.239
Ha ha ha ha!

15:23.582 --> 15:25.949
It wasn't until the fifth grade

15:25.984 --> 15:28.386
that I found out
she liked me, too.

15:28.420 --> 15:31.222
But by then her family
had moved to Scottsdale,

15:31.256 --> 15:32.323
so...

15:34.659 --> 15:36.460
<i>carpe diem,</i> okay?

15:36.495 --> 15:37.495
Okay.

15:37.529 --> 15:39.930
All right, good boy.
Ha!

15:39.965 --> 15:43.400
So, um, you'll thank Jesse
again from both of us.

15:43.435 --> 15:44.568
You got it.

15:45.937 --> 15:48.739
So is he-- How's he doing?

15:48.773 --> 15:49.806
Jesse?

15:55.180 --> 15:56.414
He's good.

15:56.448 --> 16:00.117
He's, uh... he's busy.

16:08.459 --> 16:09.559
How is it?

16:09.594 --> 16:11.561
Oh, there's space, lots of light.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.331
It's-- A little garden out back.
It's nice.

16:15.566 --> 16:19.436
And Brock? How's he doing?

16:19.470 --> 16:22.406
Hey, look, I don't mind
dropping checks off

16:22.440 --> 16:24.675
every week like Ed McMahon.

16:24.709 --> 16:27.343
But if you really want
to know how they're doing,

16:27.378 --> 16:29.712
why don't you go
see for yourself?

16:35.118 --> 16:36.552
I'll catch you later.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.522
Hey, you going to need
a ride home?

17:25.967 --> 17:27.233
Great.

17:30.840 --> 17:34.043
Anyway, I'm proud
for not losing my cool.

17:34.077 --> 17:35.811
Plus it shows
our wipe-down crew

17:35.845 --> 17:37.246
that I will support them

17:37.280 --> 17:39.448
if a customer is being
really rude to them.

17:39.483 --> 17:42.952
You're really taking
to this whole be your own boss thing.

17:42.987 --> 17:46.656
Yeah. I guess I am.

17:46.690 --> 17:49.092
Actually,

17:49.126 --> 17:52.495
I'm thinking about making
a move up to management.

17:52.529 --> 17:53.896
Mmm.
Ah, Jesus.

17:53.930 --> 17:55.197
Corporate America, look out.

17:55.232 --> 17:56.432
Oh, excuse me.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.266
I would be a vast improvement.

17:58.301 --> 18:00.268
No one in Kleinman's
entire front office

18:00.303 --> 18:02.804
knows the first thing
about giving an X-ray,

18:02.838 --> 18:04.806
which just-- ahh.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.175
Hey, Dad, uh, whatever
happened with your scan?

18:07.210 --> 18:09.445
Did-- Did you get
the results back?

18:09.479 --> 18:13.783
Yeah. I did.

18:13.817 --> 18:16.219
And I'm still in remission.

18:16.254 --> 18:20.224
So you're all going to have
to be stuck with me

18:20.258 --> 18:21.292
for a while longer.

18:21.326 --> 18:22.760
Cheers, buddy.

18:24.396 --> 18:25.763
What about you, Hank?

18:25.797 --> 18:27.264
How you feeling these days?

18:27.298 --> 18:29.433
Well, I'm getting there.

18:29.467 --> 18:31.434
The other day,
he had a big powwow

18:31.469 --> 18:34.437
with all the DEA
muckity-mucks.

18:34.471 --> 18:36.839
What was that about?

18:36.874 --> 18:40.009
Nothing. Just a dead end.

18:40.043 --> 18:42.177
He won't tell me, either.

18:42.212 --> 18:44.313
Apparently,
it's all very hush-hush.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.850
Hey, Walt, can you do me a favor?

18:49.753 --> 18:50.853
Uh, Marie's working tomorrow,

18:50.887 --> 18:52.822
and there's this gem
and mineral show

18:52.856 --> 18:53.990
that's opening
at the fairgrounds.

18:54.025 --> 18:57.694
I wondered if you can
maybe give me a lift.

18:57.728 --> 19:00.765
Yeah. Sure.

19:00.799 --> 19:03.434
I had a collection of my own
back in high school.

19:03.469 --> 19:04.469
I mean, nothing fancy.

19:04.503 --> 19:07.371
Just entry-level
beryls and garnets,

19:07.406 --> 19:10.107
one passable black tourmaline.

19:10.141 --> 19:11.875
Turn right here.
Okay.

19:11.910 --> 19:15.912
But I did have one piece
of morganite

19:15.947 --> 19:18.181
that was very special.

19:18.216 --> 19:20.350
It had been heat treated,

19:20.385 --> 19:22.619
so it had that classic
cast to it,

19:22.653 --> 19:26.923
that rose, almost salmon
hue, you know?

19:26.957 --> 19:29.359
Hey, Walt,
there's no rock show, okay?

19:29.393 --> 19:31.694
I just said that
so Marie wouldn't freak.

19:31.729 --> 19:33.896
Take a right here.

19:37.434 --> 19:40.403
Freak about what?

19:41.505 --> 19:43.505
Hank, where are we going?

19:48.445 --> 19:49.945
You hungry?

19:52.315 --> 19:54.183
We're not here for the chicken.

19:54.217 --> 19:56.285
Kill the engine.

20:00.122 --> 20:02.224
All right, heh heh heh.

20:02.258 --> 20:05.160
You ready for your mind
to be blown?

20:05.194 --> 20:07.362
Uh, sure.

20:07.396 --> 20:09.832
Gustavo Fring.

20:09.866 --> 20:11.600
Remember him?

20:11.635 --> 20:13.736
He came down to the hospital
after the shooting

20:13.771 --> 20:15.138
and put up the reward?

20:15.172 --> 20:18.775
He-- He-- He sponsors
the DEA Fun Run every year.

20:18.810 --> 20:20.177
You-- You've met him.

20:20.212 --> 20:21.579
Yeah, the--
the Fun Run guy.

20:21.613 --> 20:23.081
Yeah, that-- that guy--

20:23.115 --> 20:25.183
Yeah. What about him?

20:25.217 --> 20:26.885
Well, I suspect--

20:26.919 --> 20:28.353
and I can't prove it, mind you,

20:28.387 --> 20:30.722
but I suspect...

20:30.756 --> 20:33.124
the man's a drug dealer.

20:33.158 --> 20:35.693
Hmm.

20:35.728 --> 20:38.496
Yeah. Methamphetamine.

20:38.530 --> 20:41.932
I mean, honest to God,
I really believe

20:41.967 --> 20:44.434
that this guy's maybe
one of the biggest movers

20:44.469 --> 20:45.736
in the southwest.

20:45.770 --> 20:47.237
Remember Gale Boetticher?

20:47.271 --> 20:49.573
The, uh, that sad sack
from the karaoke video tape?

20:49.607 --> 20:50.674
Yeah.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.676
And you said
that he didn't strike you

20:52.711 --> 20:54.111
as being the boss-man type,

20:54.146 --> 20:55.780
that probably there was
a much bigger guy

20:55.814 --> 20:56.914
out there, right?

20:56.949 --> 20:58.016
Hank, that was--

20:58.050 --> 20:59.083
that was just speculation.

20:59.118 --> 21:00.752
Doesn't matter.
It made me keep at it.

21:00.786 --> 21:02.854
And guess what I find.

21:02.889 --> 21:07.993
Chicken man's fingerprints
at Boetticher's murder scene.

21:08.027 --> 21:09.461
So we bring him in--

21:09.495 --> 21:11.929
You think that--
that Gustavo Fring

21:11.964 --> 21:13.664
killed Gale Boetticher?

21:13.699 --> 21:15.299
Well, probably not.

21:15.334 --> 21:16.767
I mean, these guys use, you know,

21:16.802 --> 21:18.436
like, a dunce
to pull the trigger, right?

21:18.470 --> 21:19.503
But his fingerprints being there

21:19.538 --> 21:21.172
was enough for us
to bring him in.

21:21.206 --> 21:23.741
So I--
So you brought him in to the police?

21:23.775 --> 21:26.843
Right. He sits down
to talk with us.

21:26.878 --> 21:28.278
The problem is that he--

21:28.312 --> 21:30.614
What did you ask him?
What did he say?

21:30.648 --> 21:32.215
Walt, will you let me
finish my story here?

21:32.250 --> 21:35.953
Sorry. I'm just,
uh, interested.

21:35.988 --> 21:37.688
You know.
Yeah, all right.

21:37.723 --> 21:38.890
So we bring him in,

21:38.924 --> 21:42.460
and he proceeds
to kick our asses, okay?

21:42.494 --> 21:44.896
He's got an explanation
for the fingerprints, right?

21:44.930 --> 21:47.298
He's got an alibi
for Gale's murder.

21:47.333 --> 21:49.101
I mean, he's got reasons
for everything.

21:49.135 --> 21:51.904
This guy is <i>Terms of Endearment</i>
convincing.

21:53.673 --> 21:54.974
So he's not guilty?

21:55.008 --> 21:57.176
Well, as far as DEA
and APD are concerned,

21:57.211 --> 22:03.150
he's not. Officially,
Fring's not a suspect.

22:03.184 --> 22:07.220
Something deep down
says he's my guy.

22:07.254 --> 22:08.888
Just got to prove it.

22:11.891 --> 22:14.926
Hank, why-- why are you
telling me this?

22:17.596 --> 22:19.030
I need a favor.

22:20.633 --> 22:21.899
What favor?

22:23.302 --> 22:25.870
See that Volvo station wagon
over there?

22:27.206 --> 22:29.474
I mean, the guy drives
a 10-year-old Volvo.

22:29.509 --> 22:31.710
It's brilliant.
Anyway, listen.

22:32.846 --> 22:35.348
What I need for you to do...

22:37.351 --> 22:39.219
stick this on it.

22:42.324 --> 22:44.025
GPS tracker.

22:44.059 --> 22:46.894
You know, wifey thinks
hubby's screwing around on her,

22:46.929 --> 22:48.729
but she wants to be sure.
Hmm.

22:48.764 --> 22:49.997
You stick this on the car.

22:50.032 --> 22:52.166
This part right here?
It's a magnet.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.001
And see where he goes.

22:54.035 --> 22:55.268
Cool, huh?

22:55.303 --> 22:57.604
289 from SkyMall.

22:58.739 --> 23:00.773
Unfortunately, it's not live use,

23:00.807 --> 23:02.642
so we got to come back later
and, you know,

23:02.676 --> 23:04.610
take it off and stick it
in the computer.

23:04.644 --> 23:07.713
Still, pretty amazing times
we live in here.

23:07.747 --> 23:09.348
Hank, isn't that illegal?

23:09.383 --> 23:12.919
I mean, isn't there some
sort of unlawful search and--

23:12.953 --> 23:15.756
That's, uh,
known as extra-legal,

23:15.790 --> 23:18.859
but trust me.
It's our little secret.

23:20.395 --> 23:24.098
Look, it's easy, okay?
Here's what you do.

23:24.132 --> 23:26.000
You untie your shoelace,

23:26.034 --> 23:27.702
then you head
toward the restaurant.

23:27.736 --> 23:29.704
As you're walking past the car,

23:29.738 --> 23:31.873
you look down-- "Oh, hey,
darn, my shoe's untied."

23:31.907 --> 23:32.907
Okay?

23:32.942 --> 23:34.009
Now, when you--
when you--

23:34.043 --> 23:36.110
when you bend down
to tie your shoe,

23:36.145 --> 23:38.413
you, uh, you stick this
up into the wheel well.

23:38.447 --> 23:40.081
Then you go inside and,
I don't know--

23:40.116 --> 23:41.249
Hank, I-- I don't--

23:41.284 --> 23:42.918
I don't feel good
about this at all.

23:42.952 --> 23:44.954
Look, Walt, I-- I-- I know

23:44.988 --> 23:47.022
that this sort of thing
is outside your comfort zone--

23:47.057 --> 23:49.592
No.
I mean this is a mistake.

23:49.626 --> 23:52.494
Walt, I need you
to help me out here, okay?

23:52.528 --> 23:54.163
I mean, this is really
important to me.

23:54.197 --> 23:55.698
Jesus, just--
You make me beg you?

23:55.732 --> 23:56.999
Come on, just stick it in there.

24:05.243 --> 24:06.476
Yeah.

24:06.511 --> 24:08.712
Just act normal.

24:51.925 --> 24:53.392
May I help you?

24:57.064 --> 24:58.665
I-- I--

24:58.700 --> 25:00.734
Sir, may I help you?

25:01.836 --> 25:03.570
Look, I--

25:06.074 --> 25:07.641
I didn't do it.

25:07.676 --> 25:09.978
See? I didn't do it.

25:10.012 --> 25:11.513
Do it.

25:14.884 --> 25:16.685
Do it.

25:16.719 --> 25:19.521
May I help you with your order?

25:20.691 --> 25:21.791
I, uh--

25:37.406 --> 25:39.406
What the hell is he--

25:47.248 --> 25:50.449
Just, uh, made sure
it was secure.

25:50.484 --> 25:51.517
Uh.

25:51.552 --> 25:53.519
Where's my soda?

25:55.756 --> 25:56.922
Just kidding.

25:56.957 --> 25:58.624
Let's-- Let's go.

26:29.226 --> 26:30.267
Look, I--

26:30.387 --> 26:32.573
I swear to God I thought
I was driving the man

26:32.693 --> 26:34.027
to a gem and mineral show.

26:34.220 --> 26:36.483
And all of a sudden he has me
pulling into your restaurant

26:36.538 --> 26:40.258
and-- and-- and telling me
that he's investigating you.

26:40.293 --> 26:43.795
Look, you and I,
we've had our differences,

26:43.829 --> 26:45.030
but I would never--

26:49.035 --> 26:51.437
Look, m-my brother-in-law,

26:51.471 --> 26:54.240
evidence-wise, has nothing.

26:54.275 --> 26:56.643
He's-- He's operating
on pure conjecture,

26:56.677 --> 26:59.780
and no one-- not one person
that he works with--

26:59.815 --> 27:01.516
thinks that you are anyone

27:01.550 --> 27:04.586
other than an owner
of a fast food chain.

27:04.620 --> 27:06.988
But if something
were to happen to Hank,

27:07.022 --> 27:09.657
then that would only draw
their attention to you

27:09.692 --> 27:11.893
and therefore to me as well.

27:11.927 --> 27:13.795
So we have a mutual interest

27:13.830 --> 27:16.499
in resolving this
without violence.

27:16.533 --> 27:21.970
I will make sure
that he discovers nothing.

27:32.114 --> 27:33.080
Jesse!

27:33.114 --> 27:34.582
What?

27:34.616 --> 27:36.817
All right. Don't wait
to be, like, invited.

27:38.987 --> 27:40.320
Are we alone?

27:43.558 --> 27:45.225
So where do we stand?

27:45.259 --> 27:46.760
Where do we stand on what?

27:46.794 --> 27:48.462
Where do we stand with the thing?

27:48.497 --> 27:50.698
The thing that you were
supposed to do.

27:50.732 --> 27:52.466
I assume you haven't done it.

27:53.768 --> 27:55.202
You didn't lose it, did you?

27:55.236 --> 27:57.204
You would tell me
if you lost it, right?

27:57.238 --> 27:58.572
Oh, Jesus.

27:59.574 --> 28:01.042
Asshole.

28:01.076 --> 28:03.511
You creaming to get it done?
Go do it yourself.

28:03.546 --> 28:04.779
If he didn't see me coming

28:04.814 --> 28:06.915
like
he's some kind of--

28:06.949 --> 28:08.583
This-- All right, look.

28:08.618 --> 28:10.685
Our timetable has advanced.

28:10.719 --> 28:13.721
You have got to make
this meeting happen

28:13.755 --> 28:16.825
this week, tomorrow--
tonight, if possible.

28:16.859 --> 28:19.694
Oh. Tonight. Wow.

28:19.729 --> 28:21.363
What are you, high?

28:21.397 --> 28:22.664
My brother-in-law--

28:22.699 --> 28:25.868
My DEA agent
brother-in-law--

28:25.902 --> 28:28.071
He's on to Gus.

28:30.641 --> 28:31.841
Huh.

28:34.178 --> 28:36.112
Did you hear what I just said?

28:36.146 --> 28:38.014
My brother-in-law
is on to Gus.

28:38.048 --> 28:39.248
Ah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

28:39.283 --> 28:41.617
Your brother-in-law, okay?
I'm thinking.

28:45.388 --> 28:51.893
Look, uh, so what if this
is like math or algebra?

28:51.927 --> 28:56.397
You add a plus douche bag
to a minus douche bag

28:56.431 --> 28:59.099
and you get, like,
zero douche bags.

29:00.268 --> 29:02.302
I've got some math for you.

29:02.336 --> 29:06.273
Hank catching Gus
equals Hank catching us.

29:07.441 --> 29:08.809
Hank--
Geez.

29:08.843 --> 29:10.510
He's relentless, all right?

29:10.545 --> 29:12.012
He won't quit.

29:12.046 --> 29:14.314
Yeah, well, he's got nothing

29:14.349 --> 29:15.315
is all I can say.

29:15.350 --> 29:16.784
Oh, and how would you know that?

29:16.818 --> 29:18.752
Because he's still above ground.

29:18.786 --> 29:21.722
You think a dude like Gus
would let your boy

29:21.756 --> 29:23.557
anywhere near him?

29:23.592 --> 29:26.761
He'll break out his box cutter
on his sorry gimp ass.

29:26.795 --> 29:30.197
So you haven't even seen him

29:30.232 --> 29:32.099
since that time at the diner.

29:37.306 --> 29:39.307
Okay. Shh.

29:41.877 --> 29:43.944
Think. All right.

29:47.849 --> 29:51.185
Um, they've got to be
figuring that we've talked,

29:51.220 --> 29:54.088
so you need to tell Mike

29:54.122 --> 29:56.925
that you are worried
about Hank's investigation.

29:56.959 --> 30:00.262
Okay? Hank already knows
who you are, by the way.

30:00.296 --> 30:04.166
And besides, you actually
did kill Gale,

30:04.200 --> 30:05.534
so there's that.

30:05.568 --> 30:07.469
This is all good fodder

30:07.503 --> 30:09.671
for you to request
a sit-down with Gus

30:09.706 --> 30:11.339
so you can discuss
what you would say

30:11.374 --> 30:13.542
in case Hank brings you
in for questioning.

30:13.577 --> 30:14.877
Okay? Now you just--

30:14.911 --> 30:16.845
you just say
that you want to be--

30:16.880 --> 30:18.647
no, that--
that you need

30:18.682 --> 30:20.749
to be able to be
properly coached,

30:20.784 --> 30:21.984
and when you're near him--

30:23.286 --> 30:24.787
you put this to use.

30:24.821 --> 30:26.989
He's just going to tell me

30:27.023 --> 30:29.158
to shut my mouth if I get busted.

30:29.193 --> 30:30.927
He ain't going to set up
no meeting.

30:30.961 --> 30:33.196
Well, then insist on it, damn it!

30:33.230 --> 30:35.231
Act panicked.

30:35.265 --> 30:37.300
Gus' ass is on the line,

30:37.334 --> 30:38.968
And trust me.
He will meet with you

30:39.003 --> 30:40.436
if he thinks
that you're a liability.

30:40.471 --> 30:44.707
No, he will waste me
if he thinks I'm a liability.

30:44.742 --> 30:47.810
You know what? Whatever, man.

30:47.845 --> 30:49.478
I'm going to take a piss.

31:37.025 --> 31:41.396
Uh, I think you got a phone call.

31:49.103 --> 31:50.537
Anything important?

32:19.200 --> 32:20.367
Yes?

32:20.401 --> 32:21.635
<i>I did some digging around.</i>

32:21.669 --> 32:22.836
And?

32:23.025 --> 32:26.194
Neither the DEA nor the APD

32:26.228 --> 32:28.096
considers you
a person of interest.

32:28.130 --> 32:29.597
<i>Schrader's looking into you</i>

32:29.631 --> 32:30.898
<i>totally on his lonesome.</i>

32:30.933 --> 32:32.566
<i>A voice in the wilderness.</i>

32:32.601 --> 32:34.468
Does he have resources?

32:34.502 --> 32:36.002
<i>Just him, his credit card,</i>

32:36.037 --> 32:37.571
<i>and his chauffeur Walter.</i>

32:37.606 --> 32:40.341
From what I hear, he would be
committing career suicide

32:40.375 --> 32:42.576
if he were to mention you
to Merkert again.

32:42.611 --> 32:43.945
<i>So no warrant</i>

32:43.979 --> 32:45.412
<i>for the tracking device</i>
<i>on my car.</i>

32:45.447 --> 32:47.982
No. The guy's gone
totally maverick.

32:48.016 --> 32:50.051
He's Miss Daisy with binoculars.

32:50.085 --> 32:51.453
We watch our backs,

32:51.487 --> 32:53.121
make sure we don't
throw him any bones,

32:53.156 --> 32:54.690
he'll never make a case.

32:54.724 --> 32:56.291
What about Chile?

32:56.325 --> 32:58.926
<i>If I can't find any trace</i>
<i>of you before '89,</i>

32:58.961 --> 33:01.428
<i>I seriously doubt Schrader can.</i>

33:01.463 --> 33:04.498
Seems to me the bigger
problem's the cartel.

33:04.533 --> 33:08.402
We can handle them if that's
all we've got on our plate.

33:08.436 --> 33:10.637
But dealing with both Schrader

33:10.672 --> 33:13.807
and the Mexicans
at the same time,

33:13.842 --> 33:18.246
if he happens to be watching
when they make a move,

33:18.280 --> 33:21.115
<i>they could be the perfect storm.</i>

33:21.149 --> 33:22.650
Thank you.

33:22.684 --> 33:24.585
I'll be in touch.

34:14.637 --> 34:16.170
Hello, Hector.

34:20.610 --> 34:24.612
The cartel has given me
its ultimatum,

34:24.647 --> 34:26.380
to which I've said no.

34:29.885 --> 34:32.119
DEA agent Schrader--

34:32.152 --> 34:34.321
uh, he's a concern.

34:36.958 --> 34:39.360
He's looking into my past.

34:53.373 --> 34:56.176
Is today the day, Hector?

35:05.796 --> 35:07.182
Si.

46:10.331 --> 46:11.733
Look at me, Hector.

46:18.581 --> 46:23.142
Look... at... me.

46:45.026 --> 46:47.133
Maybe next time.
