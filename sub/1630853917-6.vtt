00:40.791 --> 00:44.127
JP!

00:49.424 --> 00:50.759
Mom!

00:51.635 --> 00:53.220
Mom, are you there?

00:53.971 --> 00:56.223
Because, seriously,
I can't go in like this.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.933
It's all creases.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.890
You will take care out there today,
won't you? With Gerald.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.518
I wasn't planning on killing the man,
Grace.

02:22.518 --> 02:25.103
It's a honey trap, hence the honey.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.940
What's wrong with you?
-Bibi's still not answering my calls.

02:27.940 --> 02:31.235
Of course she isn't. She's in
a state of shame and rightfully so.

02:31.235 --> 02:32.778
I say, leave her to it.

02:32.778 --> 02:33.946
It was an accident.

02:33.946 --> 02:38.367
What was a one-eyed woman doing out there
in the first place, shooting a gun?

02:38.367 --> 02:39.618
Because we invited her.

02:39.618 --> 02:43.497
Well, it wasn't "we"
who half-blinded a man, was it?

02:43.997 --> 02:46.083
There's your villain. Let her stew in it.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.502
Where are you off to all dressed up?

02:48.502 --> 02:51.713
Dressed up? I'm wearing a coat.

02:55.384 --> 02:56.760
I'm going to an art class.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.888
I think that's great.

03:00.848 --> 03:04.184
Lesser women would've been knocked
by what they did to you at dance class.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.437
I used to be good at art.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.441
Did you? Can't remember.

03:13.402 --> 03:14.403
Have fun.

03:18.282 --> 03:19.992
Sorry.
There's no talking to her at the moment.

03:19.992 --> 03:23.245
She just doesn't want to see anyone.
-Well, we're hardly anyone. Are we?

03:23.245 --> 03:26.748
I know, and I'd love for you to come in
and shake her out of it, I would,

03:26.832 --> 03:29.459
but she's not like herself. I'm sorry.

03:34.173 --> 03:35.299
Well, then forget her.

03:36.133 --> 03:39.720
I don't know why I'm having to come to her
anyway. She's the one who split my lip.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.471
Nutjob.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.817
Is this the very day?

03:57.613 --> 03:58.614
What?

03:58.614 --> 04:01.783
The boat. Is today the very day
we get to take her out?

04:01.867 --> 04:04.244
Talk me through your thinking here, Roger.

04:04.328 --> 04:09.249
Would I have carted her all the way
down here to what? Surprise you?

04:09.333 --> 04:11.627
Does it matter why you carted it
all the way down here?

04:11.627 --> 04:13.045
Exactly.

04:14.046 --> 04:16.130
Why did you cart her
all the way down here?

04:17.798 --> 04:19.593
I'm taking Gerald, my boss,

04:19.593 --> 04:20.969
out for an after--

04:21.053 --> 04:22.471
One second.

04:28.852 --> 04:29.853
Everything all right?

04:31.730 --> 04:32.731
No show?

04:35.025 --> 04:39.279
You know, when God closes the door,
you just open a window.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.658
I've got all the gear.

04:42.658 --> 04:47.621
We could head out. Cast a wee line.
Breathe in no better air.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.290
I was expecting lemonade, Roger.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.377
Don't much fancy sucking the lemon.

05:07.975 --> 05:13.480
So, how do you feel about carrying on
after everything that's happened?

05:15.399 --> 05:18.527
Him. It. Carrying on.

05:18.527 --> 05:21.989
All I can think about right now is
what happened to that poor fucker's eye.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.992
And that it was Bibi, of all people,
who pulled the trigger.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.371
So, no more collateral damage.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.790
If we were going to try again,

05:31.874 --> 05:36.753
we need zero risk of dogs and people and
anything getting caught in the cross fire.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.548
Yes, so we may as well
just light a candle,

05:40.048 --> 05:42.301
hope he drowns himself in his bath
at night.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.346
Why didn't I think of that?

05:47.556 --> 05:49.933
Think of what? Asking him to kill himself?

05:50.017 --> 05:54.897
No, drugging him.
Putting him in a very full bath.

05:54.897 --> 05:59.651
Ursula, you've told me hundreds of times
that drugs show up in a postmortem.

05:59.735 --> 06:02.821
Rohypnol doesn't. There's no trace of it.

06:02.905 --> 06:05.407
It's the same reason
why most rape trials fall apart.

06:06.241 --> 06:08.410
I could get some from work.

06:09.328 --> 06:10.329
Won't be missed.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.415
What do you think?

06:14.833 --> 06:15.876
I don't--

06:16.376 --> 06:17.377
I think--

06:19.755 --> 06:22.674
I think nothing happens
unless Bibi's back.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.510
Yeah.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.096
I don't wanna tell you
how to live your life,

06:28.180 --> 06:33.101
but you should consider keeping your wine
in the fridge like a poor person.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.942
Min! Which one?

06:40.609 --> 06:42.444
Anything with alcohol, darling.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.577
What are you doing down there?

06:51.245 --> 06:52.955
Grabbing wine and seeing Min.

06:52.955 --> 06:55.624
Well, I told you,
nobody needs you coming around here.

06:55.624 --> 06:56.750
Go home.

06:56.834 --> 07:00.462
She's my friend.
-Is that what she told you?

07:00.546 --> 07:03.715
Any old excuse to come around here
and drink up my inheritance.

07:03.799 --> 07:05.425
Your inheritance? Are you joking me?

07:05.509 --> 07:08.345
She's just here for your money
because she couldn't weasel any out of me.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.721
You're a slimy piece of shit.

07:09.805 --> 07:12.432
You're a scheming bitch.
-Children! Less of this.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.270
Leave your sister be, John Paul.

07:16.270 --> 07:20.274
Your father will be home soon,
and you mustn't rile his temper again.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.525
Mama...

07:24.236 --> 07:25.988
He's not coming home.

07:25.988 --> 07:27.781
Oh, my God.

07:27.865 --> 07:30.784
Why would you say that to her?
What does it give you?

07:31.285 --> 07:33.662
Go snatch a purse.
There'll be less work in it for you.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.497
You should be the one who goes.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.250
No one called for you.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.752
Mum. You silly thing.

07:41.420 --> 07:42.796
You need help.

07:43.755 --> 07:47.092
You need to go into that care home
we talked about.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.011
Remember?

07:49.761 --> 07:50.846
Professional care.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.932
For your own good.
-Just go.

07:54.933 --> 07:55.934
Do as she says.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.274
What won't you stoop to?

08:03.358 --> 08:04.776
Incredible.

08:04.860 --> 08:08.113
Min, are you okay?
-Yes.

08:08.822 --> 08:09.823
Min?

08:11.033 --> 08:12.326
He can't just do that.

08:12.326 --> 08:16.371
I mean,
he can't just put you in a home. Can he?

08:17.497 --> 08:20.501
Min? Min! Seriously?

08:20.501 --> 08:25.088
I signed it. I didn't want you
getting all the bloody credit.

08:27.549 --> 08:30.135
That's some pretty racy content, Min.

08:30.219 --> 08:31.970
Extra surprise for my girl.

08:33.804 --> 08:34.972
What's that?

08:35.057 --> 08:36.933
The fees for next term.

08:38.519 --> 08:43.232
For God's sake, dear. We can't have you
coming back here without an education.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.735
Your father would marry you off
to a fat farmer.

08:52.491 --> 08:53.867
Eight grand.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.423
All right, folks. Let's pause it there.

09:08.507 --> 09:09.508
Give Monica ten minutes

09:09.508 --> 09:10.801
to shake her bones out.

09:14.096 --> 09:16.139
Hiya, Margo. Nice to see you're back.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.892
I like the colors you're using there.
-Oh, yeah.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.686
Captures her hair well.

09:24.356 --> 09:25.357
Great.

09:32.698 --> 09:33.782
This is good.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.201
Is it? I don't know.

09:36.827 --> 09:37.828
It is.

09:39.454 --> 09:41.456
I can tell by the way
you're using your line though,

09:41.540 --> 09:43.750
bit nervous
drawing the more intimate parts.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.922
Surely by now, you're a woman at home
in her own body, no?

09:49.673 --> 09:52.551
I'm not sure my husband
would necessarily agree with you.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.761
What's it got to do with him?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.015
It's your body to be comfortable with.

11:05.457 --> 11:06.542
What the hell?

11:19.137 --> 11:22.641
There he is now,
creeping around like Benjamin Franklin.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.102
That's an impressive reference.

11:25.102 --> 11:27.896
I just watched a documentary on him.
What a perv.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.857
So now I'm a perv?

11:31.608 --> 11:33.610
Take it you won't be having one of these.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.154
I'm watching you.

11:39.157 --> 11:42.870
How are you this morning?
-I am disabled with anxiety.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.622
You?
-Same. Overflowing with guilt.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.250
But other than that...

11:52.004 --> 11:53.255
What are you doing today?

11:53.255 --> 11:56.091
I was thinking
of actually taking the day off.

11:56.175 --> 12:00.470
If you're free
we could do something together.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.600
Are you gonna wear trousers?

12:07.477 --> 12:09.104
Do you want me to wear trousers?

12:09.855 --> 12:10.856
Oh, yeah.

12:12.858 --> 12:15.068
Both your balls
are hanging out of my poor shorts.

12:21.283 --> 12:25.662
Come on, you stupid f-- Dick!

12:25.746 --> 12:29.291
Find something. See something.

12:34.505 --> 12:37.674
Does "released without charge"
mean nothing to you people?

12:37.758 --> 12:39.551
Sorry?
-Are you now?

12:40.052 --> 12:42.638
Well, the last lot of concerned citizens
I had 'round here

12:42.638 --> 12:44.681
got a lot worse off the guards
than I ever did.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.727
Sir, excuse me. Sorry.

12:48.727 --> 12:52.981
Did you-- Were you friends
with John Paul Williams by any chance?

12:54.816 --> 12:58.487
And who are you supposed to be?
-Does it matter to the question?

13:01.281 --> 13:02.449
Let me tell you something.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.744
There's no such thing
as being friends with that man.

13:05.744 --> 13:06.828
Do you hear me?

13:06.912 --> 13:08.664
They say don't speak ill of the dead,

13:08.664 --> 13:11.083
but I say it's just a shame

13:11.792 --> 13:14.586
that he didn't do himself in properly
the first time he tried.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.429
Bla, I love you.
-Love you too.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.058
Morning, all.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.643
More questions?

13:29.643 --> 13:31.270
Mam.
-Bye, hon.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.354
Bye.

13:33.689 --> 13:34.815
What happened to your face?

13:34.815 --> 13:36.859
Nothing.
Just-- You should see my wife.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.862
That was a joke. May I?

13:45.909 --> 13:47.494
You're on your own today.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.289
That's right.
Can't get the help these days.

13:50.289 --> 13:52.416
Everyone's after a million quid
for doing nothing.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.296
Just his day off is all.

13:59.715 --> 14:01.258
You've been doing some rearranging?

14:01.258 --> 14:02.843
Trying to anyway.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.846
Nearly bust a gut moving this thing.

14:07.181 --> 14:09.474
Wanted it here since forever, but...

14:09.558 --> 14:13.353
JP? Wasn't so keen?

14:13.437 --> 14:14.730
No, but...

14:16.732 --> 14:19.902
wouldn't do much good
to preserve the place in aspic.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.825
Grace, I'm afraid I have to ask.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.786
How do I put this?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.414
Did JP ever try to harm himself?

14:33.749 --> 14:34.750
What have you heard?

14:36.335 --> 14:39.421
I wouldn't ask if
it wasn't entirely pertinent to the claim.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.097
What?

15:01.944 --> 15:04.238
Roger, you're an angel.

15:04.238 --> 15:07.658
I've been at JP to prune those for weeks.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.326
Hiya, Gracie.

15:10.035 --> 15:12.496
I hope you don't mind.
It was just that I was doing me own

15:12.496 --> 15:16.041
and I thought maybe I'll come over
and, you know, save you the bother.

15:17.292 --> 15:19.169
Oh, Roger. I ne--

15:19.253 --> 15:22.005
I never had you as a mover, Roger.
-Oh, God. Aye.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.466
See, my mother sent me for lessons
when I was a kid.

15:24.550 --> 15:26.677
Only way
I was gonna get myself a woman.

15:26.677 --> 15:30.138
She used to say, learn to dance
and you're in with a chance.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.600
Come on then, you.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.524
You're some mover.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.073
What on earth?

15:50.200 --> 15:52.327
Jesus Christ.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.377
Give the nod when you wanna cut in, JP.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.922
What a terrible, terrible noise.

16:04.006 --> 16:07.342
Remember, we nearly had a soul deejay
at our wedding

16:07.426 --> 16:09.178
till you said he was too expensive.

16:09.178 --> 16:11.388
Can you not get a wife of your own?

16:11.972 --> 16:13.473
Sure. Who would have me?

16:13.557 --> 16:15.184
Look at the bushes, JP.

16:15.684 --> 16:17.686
Roger, bless him, pruned them for you.

16:19.271 --> 16:20.939
Lovely day down at the quay.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.650
Probably would've been better
if you got the boat out, huh?

16:23.734 --> 16:25.611
Oh, yeah. How'd you get on?

16:27.237 --> 16:29.948
Fine. Got on fine.

16:30.532 --> 16:31.533
Come on.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.244
Thank you for the dance, my lady.

16:34.328 --> 16:35.329
Thank you.

16:38.624 --> 16:39.833
JP.

16:41.293 --> 16:44.213
Do you know you're a very lucky man?

16:45.506 --> 16:46.965
I wake up smiling, Roger.

16:52.137 --> 16:53.180
Yeah, I bet you do.

17:05.733 --> 17:06.734
Hello.

17:09.279 --> 17:15.035
I'm a local parent and I wish
to raise a red flag regards an individual.

17:15.868 --> 17:20.540
The issue is
my son attends a church youth group,

17:20.624 --> 17:24.877
and the guy running it
has shown an unnatural interest in my son.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.966
I'm worried he's molesting him.

17:28.966 --> 17:32.177
Oh, yes. Yes.
I am prepared to name the man. I am.

17:32.928 --> 17:34.471
Yeah. Yes.

17:34.555 --> 17:36.723
His name is Roger Muldoon.

17:37.933 --> 17:39.852
Double O, Muldoon. That's right. Yes.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.396
Thank you.

18:29.443 --> 18:30.444
Come on.

18:38.952 --> 18:42.789
So, tell me then about your day.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.333
Where's my book?

18:45.667 --> 18:46.668
Your book?

18:47.252 --> 18:50.797
Book. Object of fiction,
loads of pages bound together with glue.

18:52.466 --> 18:53.467
Are you okay?

18:54.676 --> 19:00.390
You weren't jealous earlier on, were you?
About Roger?

19:02.142 --> 19:03.310
What are you wearing?

19:04.102 --> 19:05.312
Is that new?

19:05.312 --> 19:06.522
Do you like it?

19:08.982 --> 19:11.026
What do you think you look like?

19:12.402 --> 19:13.612
What? What does that mean?

19:13.612 --> 19:16.114
Do you know
when you look your most beautiful?

19:18.450 --> 19:20.827
When I can't see any of them in you.

19:21.703 --> 19:24.414
So, it's my sisters' fault
you don't look at me like that anymore?

19:24.498 --> 19:26.583
Don't do that, Gracie.

19:27.084 --> 19:28.252
Don't debase yourself.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.552
I know you hate talking about it...

19:38.387 --> 19:42.266
but we could try

19:43.225 --> 19:45.894
things you can take to help.

19:46.687 --> 19:49.731
There's no shame in just trying the pills,
John Paul.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.192
Lots of men take them.

19:52.276 --> 19:56.530
This cheap thing
makes you say cheap things.

19:58.490 --> 19:59.950
Get a grip of yourself.

20:44.036 --> 20:47.789
You know the Galway netball tournament,
the overnight?

20:47.873 --> 20:50.709
Tomorrow? Do you need some money for it?

20:52.294 --> 20:54.463
One of the other moms dropped out.

20:54.463 --> 20:56.548
I was wondering if you'd come?

20:57.883 --> 20:58.884
Hon.

21:00.469 --> 21:02.429
You know, you don't need to look after me.

21:03.388 --> 21:04.473
Course I do.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.808
It's just a dropout...

21:08.852 --> 21:11.813
and an excuse to get you away
to lavish money on me.

21:15.526 --> 21:16.527
Cheeky.

21:29.164 --> 21:30.582
Do you think it's me?

21:31.083 --> 21:34.336
Grace, no. Not on your worst week.

21:34.336 --> 21:36.755
It's him. Of course it's him.

21:37.673 --> 21:40.425
Thing is, I still look at him

21:40.509 --> 21:43.887
and I still think he's bloody gorgeous.

21:44.638 --> 21:46.640
Maybe that's just marriage.

21:48.642 --> 21:52.271
I mean, I wouldn't say as much as that.

21:52.771 --> 21:54.314
So, you and Donal still

21:55.607 --> 21:56.608
have sex?

21:57.401 --> 22:01.238
We-- I keep my hand in.

22:01.238 --> 22:03.407
Oh, my God. It is me.

22:05.993 --> 22:10.956
Grace, you're a natural-born feckin' ride.

22:11.623 --> 22:13.417
Of course it's his fault.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.252
You wanna have sex.

22:15.252 --> 22:16.962
It's him who's gone rancid.

22:17.588 --> 22:19.548
When did you last actually...

22:24.219 --> 22:25.888
Jesus.
-I know.

22:26.805 --> 22:30.392
Maybe, I mean--
Maybe I have let myself go.

22:32.436 --> 22:33.562
Sorry.

22:34.730 --> 22:37.441
Nah, I'm joking. It's box fresh.
Never been used.

22:37.441 --> 22:39.651
Take it must be going pretty well
with Grant then.

22:39.735 --> 22:40.736
It's Gabriel.

22:40.736 --> 22:43.405
No, not really. He's gay.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.574
Gabriel's gay.

22:46.909 --> 22:48.368
Well, it's very nice.

22:48.452 --> 22:49.494
No, it's for you.

22:50.495 --> 22:52.247
Take it home.
-Get it where you can, sis.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.583
That's her motto.
Ah, f--

22:54.583 --> 22:56.210
Well, thanks, I think.

22:58.504 --> 23:00.631
I have to go.
-Okay.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.592
I just wish to God he'd try the pills.

23:05.093 --> 23:07.304
But maybe he just doesn't see me
like that anymore,

23:08.347 --> 23:10.807
or as a person worth listening to.

23:10.891 --> 23:13.060
There is not a thing wrong with you.

23:13.685 --> 23:16.188
Yeah. Well, that's the great thing
about you lot.

23:16.188 --> 23:17.564
You have to say that.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.069
Bye, honey.
-Bye, love.

23:24.196 --> 23:25.572
The poor thing.

23:27.491 --> 23:29.368
We have to see this through, Eva.

23:29.368 --> 23:31.036
There's not gonna be anything left of her.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.121
Not without Bibi.

23:37.501 --> 23:39.419
You need to go and talk to her.
Make things right.

23:40.254 --> 23:41.547
You.

25:08.008 --> 25:09.092
Gracie.

25:23.899 --> 25:29.279
I think you are, if you'll forgive
my bluntness, skirting around the issue.

25:29.363 --> 25:30.656
Will you help me out here, Grace?

25:30.656 --> 25:32.199
What is it
you think I should be telling you?

25:32.199 --> 25:33.283
His mental health.

25:33.367 --> 25:35.911
Was he depressed? Were there any affairs?

25:35.911 --> 25:37.996
Because I need to take
the view here, Grace,

25:38.080 --> 25:40.624
as to how likely it is
that your husband died by his own hand.

25:40.624 --> 25:43.418
You think I owe you
the sensitive details of my marriage?

25:43.502 --> 25:44.711
No, probably not.

25:47.422 --> 25:48.924
Sorry. I'm--

25:51.969 --> 25:54.388
I'm under a lot of pressure
from everywhere.

25:56.682 --> 25:58.767
And my wife and I are expecting a baby.

26:00.227 --> 26:01.979
So I'm barely sleeping.

26:04.606 --> 26:05.607
He was the same.

26:08.902 --> 26:12.906
John Paul. Before Blanaid-- Full of worry.

26:12.990 --> 26:16.285
Yeah,
but also it's the size of everything.

26:16.285 --> 26:18.871
You know,
she takes up a lot of space in the bed.

26:19.830 --> 26:21.456
But, yeah, you know, the worry too.

26:23.041 --> 26:24.585
Talk about male fragility, hey?

26:25.169 --> 26:28.005
You'd think it'd be the mothers losing it,
but Theresa's fine.

26:28.922 --> 26:32.926
Happy as,
laid up on the bed like bloody Boudicca.

26:35.262 --> 26:37.222
I think I might have something for you.

26:41.685 --> 26:43.020
They were Blanaid's.

26:47.232 --> 26:49.026
They might not be in fashion now.

26:53.947 --> 26:57.284
Well, thanks. Thanks very much.

26:59.870 --> 27:01.705
There is a difference.
-Sorry?

27:01.705 --> 27:05.876
Between skirting around the details
because you're trying to hide something

27:05.876 --> 27:07.920
and skirting around the details

27:07.920 --> 27:11.757
because they're incredibly hard
to look at head-on.

27:16.053 --> 27:21.517
The reason I don't talk about JP's
suicide attempt is because he wouldn't.

27:22.893 --> 27:26.647
There's only so much I can know.
Mostly from his doctors.

27:27.773 --> 27:33.278
The other reason is, deep down,
I have to wonder...

27:36.490 --> 27:38.033
was it because of me?

27:40.160 --> 27:42.704
Was I the reason he once wanted to die?

27:50.712 --> 27:53.257
Hey, Siri. Plot me a route
from here to the local hospital.

28:01.473 --> 28:04.560
Well, now.
Hadn't that plenty to say for itself.

28:05.310 --> 28:06.895
We didn't release that one.
-Good.

28:07.729 --> 28:11.692
Joking. Nice bass. Very bassy.

28:22.870 --> 28:24.371
Does he know you're with me?

28:27.374 --> 28:28.584
Nor do my lot.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.879
Really? You all seem so close.

28:32.504 --> 28:34.715
We are. But you're a Claffin.

28:35.465 --> 28:37.843
You're currently
making our lives a misery, so...

28:39.386 --> 28:40.596
Plus, they're still my sisters.

28:40.596 --> 28:42.973
They generally don't approve
of who's in my bed.

28:42.973 --> 28:45.642
They think you make bad choices?
-I usually do.

28:48.270 --> 28:49.271
Hey.

28:49.938 --> 28:53.317
I wonder sometimes, you know,
with my mam and dad not here--

28:54.359 --> 29:00.032
That I'm doing it because I want someone
to tell me I deserve better.

29:00.532 --> 29:02.659
Do you think they
would've interfered like that?

29:02.743 --> 29:03.827
Jesus. I hope so.

29:04.328 --> 29:06.788
I've gone out with some real reprobates.

29:11.001 --> 29:12.753
Sometimes, I think they still might.

29:14.463 --> 29:15.464
What do you mean?

29:17.132 --> 29:18.258
I don't know.

29:18.342 --> 29:21.136
Maybe some night I'll be sat with some lad

29:22.471 --> 29:25.599
who's not some arbitrary arsehole.

29:27.142 --> 29:28.602
And maybe I'll hear

29:29.520 --> 29:32.397
music or something.

29:35.567 --> 29:36.777
Too bonkers?

29:38.153 --> 29:41.114
You tell me something about you, then.
Something grisly.

29:50.916 --> 29:51.917
Grisly?

29:53.210 --> 29:58.966
Well, I just found out that my dad
didn't just up and die.

30:00.384 --> 30:02.177
He actually killed himself.

30:03.679 --> 30:05.722
Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.476
Found out
Thomas had been keeping it from me.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.144
Jesus.

30:12.771 --> 30:14.106
Maybe it was a kindness?

30:16.233 --> 30:17.734
What sort of kindness is that?

30:18.902 --> 30:20.946
I don't know. A misguided one?

30:25.367 --> 30:26.785
I mean, I get that you're hurting,

30:26.869 --> 30:30.372
but if the cost of that is
your relationship with your only brother,

30:30.372 --> 30:34.042
then price is too high.

30:36.295 --> 30:38.172
'Cause take it from me...

30:40.507 --> 30:41.758
you only have each other.

30:52.186 --> 30:53.937
Jesus.

31:12.039 --> 31:14.082
Here.
-Jesus. I owe you one.

31:14.166 --> 31:16.293
Expect those cup final tickets
in the post.

31:16.293 --> 31:17.377
Yeah. Sure.

31:33.894 --> 31:34.895
Okay.

31:39.816 --> 31:40.817
F--

31:42.945 --> 31:44.696
Hey, it's me again, obviously.

31:45.197 --> 31:46.615
Just in case you didn't recognize the--

31:47.241 --> 31:50.661
I know you have nothing but good reasons
for not picking up your phone.

31:50.661 --> 31:54.331
I know you're angry with me,
and we've lots to talk about.

31:54.331 --> 31:58.210
But for God's sake, pick up your phone,
listen to this and call me back.

31:58.210 --> 31:59.795
I've got a hold of something big.

31:59.795 --> 32:04.174
And if it's as big as I've decided it is,
it's gonna save both our arses.

32:04.258 --> 32:07.886
So please, Matt, for the sake
of my f-- gastric acid if nothing else,

32:07.970 --> 32:09.054
just talk to me.

32:25.362 --> 32:28.115
If you're gonna hit me again,
do you mind aiming for the bottom lip?

32:28.949 --> 32:30.576
Even things out.

32:31.410 --> 32:34.997
For God's sake. Fine. I deserved it.

32:34.997 --> 32:37.958
Well, what about him in there? He didn't.

32:40.085 --> 32:43.172
I shot his bloody eye out, Becka.

32:43.172 --> 32:45.966
Do you know what that looks like?
'Cause I have a pretty full idea.

32:50.137 --> 32:54.391
I thought I was owed this.
And to get even for myself.

32:56.894 --> 32:59.271
And all I managed to do was this
to someone else.

33:01.440 --> 33:02.691
Well, I pushed you.

33:04.067 --> 33:05.235
So it's my fault.

33:08.322 --> 33:12.367
The only mistake you made
was thinking that any of this was for you.

33:15.370 --> 33:16.997
It should have been for your sister.

33:19.833 --> 33:22.294
He's ground her down so small, Bibi.

33:23.462 --> 33:24.588
I was with her earlier.

33:26.215 --> 33:28.592
She doesn't even see herself
as a woman anymore.

33:30.052 --> 33:32.221
There'll be nothing left of her soon.

33:33.639 --> 33:35.057
And Blanaid's next.

33:44.733 --> 33:48.695
Tomorrow night,
Grace is taking Blanaid to Galway.

33:50.531 --> 33:54.785
We're gonna roofie him
and put him in a very full bath.

33:56.119 --> 33:57.162
We need you there.

33:59.456 --> 34:03.043
No, this has to stop.

34:03.043 --> 34:05.796
Why? What the hell's changed?

34:05.796 --> 34:07.172
What do you think?

34:07.965 --> 34:09.132
Him in there?

34:10.509 --> 34:13.804
Well, if we don't finish the job,
then what has he lost his eye for?

34:13.804 --> 34:14.929
Nothing at all.

34:22.312 --> 34:23.522
You okay?

34:24.481 --> 34:26.190
Okay. Enter your room.
-Thank you.

34:26.275 --> 34:27.734
Careful now.

34:27.818 --> 34:29.902
You're heading for the wall. I've got you.

34:32.822 --> 34:34.116
You gonna be the boss now?

34:35.409 --> 34:37.369
Well, you gotta get used to...

34:50.007 --> 34:51.132
What's going on?

34:52.592 --> 34:54.678
No. I'll find out.

34:57.097 --> 34:59.266
Can you explain to me
exactly what was said?

34:59.266 --> 35:00.350
Can I call my sister?

35:00.434 --> 35:02.436
You'll be allowed a phone call
at the station.

35:06.148 --> 35:08.483
Excuse me. What's going on?

35:08.567 --> 35:10.110
Can't tell you that.

35:10.611 --> 35:12.487
We've gotta go.
-Yeah.

35:20.704 --> 35:22.372
JP, what's it all about?

35:23.248 --> 35:24.917
Well, what do you think it's usually about

35:24.917 --> 35:27.169
when the police confiscate
a man's computer?

35:28.587 --> 35:29.588
Sad.

35:37.513 --> 35:39.765
Doesn't sound like much of a yes.

35:39.765 --> 35:42.142
Well, it wasn't a no either.

35:42.226 --> 35:44.019
Was she pleased to see you?

35:44.019 --> 35:46.188
Yeah.
-Really?

35:46.188 --> 35:47.397
Course she wasn't.

35:52.402 --> 35:53.403
Bibi.

35:55.781 --> 35:57.115
I'm really glad you're here.

35:57.908 --> 35:58.909
You okay?

36:01.828 --> 36:03.580
Hug me back, you cow.

36:08.877 --> 36:09.878
Okay.

36:10.420 --> 36:13.215
So, someone talk me
through this plan then.

36:13.715 --> 36:16.802
Right. So, Ursula reckons
that she can nick a bottle of Rohypnol

36:16.802 --> 36:19.471
from the hospital and provided that works,

36:20.180 --> 36:23.684
we gotta figure out
a means of just getting it into him.

36:29.857 --> 36:30.858
And that's it?

36:32.776 --> 36:34.194
Well, there's the bath, Eva.

36:34.278 --> 36:36.989
Tell her about the bath.
-You already told me about the bath.

36:44.246 --> 36:46.164
Let Urs know to be there around 8:00.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.625
The prick's like a child.

36:48.709 --> 36:51.753
He can't cook, won't learn
and he's too tight to pay for delivery.

36:51.837 --> 36:55.132
So at some stage tonight,
he'll leave to pick up some greasy shite.

36:55.132 --> 36:56.425
Are we going in a window?

36:57.301 --> 36:59.094
I lost my spare key to theirs years ago.

36:59.636 --> 37:00.721
Yeah, well, I didn't.

37:01.763 --> 37:03.390
Can we put the stuff in a drink?

37:03.390 --> 37:05.726
Isn't that sort of, like,
you know, textbook?

37:06.268 --> 37:08.729
Put it in the milk.
-Not gonna put it in the milk.

37:09.605 --> 37:11.190
Grace and Blanaid drink the milk.

37:12.649 --> 37:13.942
They love milk.

37:17.112 --> 37:19.573
It's gotta be something that--
-His nasal spray.

37:22.034 --> 37:24.828
I don't know what's in that stuff,
but he's basically addicted to it.

37:24.912 --> 37:29.666
Remind me never to interrogate why Bibi
seems to be just naturally gifted at this.

37:32.503 --> 37:34.129
You don't need to do it, you know?

37:34.922 --> 37:35.923
Any of it.

37:37.382 --> 37:40.010
It's him or Grace. Right?

37:41.762 --> 37:42.930
So, yeah.

37:44.097 --> 37:45.432
I think maybe I do, actually.

37:49.228 --> 37:50.229
Okay.

37:52.231 --> 37:55.651
So, I'll tell her you're back
and the plans on.

37:55.651 --> 37:59.154
Right? Get her to do a little shopping
in the medical store.

38:15.045 --> 38:16.505
All right, stranger?

38:16.505 --> 38:19.925
Stranger? Didn't I pass you toilet paper
through a door earlier?

38:19.925 --> 38:22.845
Yeah, but you were gone
by the time I was finished.

38:25.305 --> 38:28.517
That's what you're after, following me
into the drug store like a bloody sneak.

38:28.517 --> 38:30.519
I wasn't following you-- Look, I was j--

38:30.519 --> 38:32.479
I was just stood in the bloody corridor.

38:32.980 --> 38:36.650
Urs, are we okay?

38:36.650 --> 38:37.734
What? I mean--

38:37.818 --> 38:40.612
I'm entitled to ask,
and I feel like I should ask.

38:41.572 --> 38:46.952
I feel like I haven't been able
to get through to you for a while now.

38:47.786 --> 38:50.581
S-- Like, is there a reason?

38:54.251 --> 38:55.878
Can you put your arms around me?

38:58.630 --> 38:59.631
It's me.

39:00.591 --> 39:04.344
Feel like I've been a million miles away
from everything recently.

39:04.928 --> 39:06.305
Including myself.

39:06.305 --> 39:07.431
What's going on?

39:09.433 --> 39:10.434
I don't know.

39:12.019 --> 39:13.103
Do you still love me?

39:17.441 --> 39:18.483
Oh, shite.

39:20.819 --> 39:21.820
Takeaway tonight.

39:21.904 --> 39:23.363
Talk about it then.
-I can't.

39:23.447 --> 39:27.409
I'm sorry. I promised Carmel I'd leave it
open in case she needs me for a double.

39:27.409 --> 39:29.786
All right. Well, soon then. All right?

39:29.870 --> 39:31.205
<i>Donal, come in.</i>

39:31.205 --> 39:33.665
Yep. On my way to you now.
I'll be two minutes.

40:09.785 --> 40:11.620
Come on, cookie. Let's go.

40:11.620 --> 40:12.704
Gracie.

40:14.873 --> 40:17.251
Aren't you forgetting something?
-Sorry.

40:17.251 --> 40:20.963
I really had no idea
you were this unhappy with me.

40:20.963 --> 40:22.214
Sorry?

40:22.798 --> 40:26.343
I didn't say no, did I?
To trying your little funny blue pills.

40:26.343 --> 40:27.594
JP, what is this?

40:29.012 --> 40:31.390
Blanaid is right there.
-Mum, we going?

40:31.390 --> 40:33.600
Right there.
-Is it porn too? Is it?

40:33.684 --> 40:35.519
Should I be going through
the browser history

40:35.519 --> 40:37.521
to find out what my wife is really into?

40:37.521 --> 40:40.065
We can't do this now.
She's on the team, JP. I have to take her.

40:41.441 --> 40:42.484
Please.

40:44.361 --> 40:48.240
I have it
because we are not like that anymore,

40:48.240 --> 40:51.243
and I need something.

40:51.243 --> 40:53.287
So, this is supposed to be my fault now,
is it?

40:53.287 --> 40:55.914
Well, is it mine?
-I'm not an old man, Grace.

40:55.998 --> 40:58.876
So ask yourself,
"Could the reason be you?"

41:00.294 --> 41:02.754
It mightn't have come to this
if you just put some effort into

41:02.838 --> 41:05.549
being something
I want to get into bed with at night.

41:06.133 --> 41:07.217
Don't you dare.

41:07.301 --> 41:10.721
Don't you dare go put netball
before me and this marriage.

41:10.721 --> 41:13.640
Grace! Grace, come back here!

41:34.995 --> 41:36.413
Jesus. Get in.

41:37.206 --> 41:39.082
Marvelous time
you chose to take a piss, Ursula.

41:39.166 --> 41:41.543
Talk to me
once you've pushed out a brace of kids.

41:42.044 --> 41:43.337
He didn't see me, did he?

41:45.005 --> 41:46.215
Oh, shit.

41:50.052 --> 41:51.261
Are you psychic?

41:51.929 --> 41:53.722
How did you know
he was gonna go for takeaway?

41:54.306 --> 41:55.849
You didn't drop the...

41:57.226 --> 41:59.686
What do we
if he comes back and we're in there?

41:59.770 --> 42:01.146
We'll hide under Blanaid's bed.

42:01.230 --> 42:03.398
We're not hiding under Blanaid's bed.
-In the cupboard then.

42:03.482 --> 42:06.777
We're not hiding in cupboards
or under beds, okay? Jesus.

42:06.777 --> 42:08.320
Are we gonna do this or not?

42:08.320 --> 42:11.031
Well, if yes, then get going.
I'll keep watch.

42:19.706 --> 42:21.041
Let's wear white to his funeral.

42:27.214 --> 42:28.799
He's all but dependent on the stuff.

42:28.799 --> 42:32.135
What kind of prick doesn't keep
his medicine in the medicine drawer?

42:32.845 --> 42:34.263
What if he has it on him?

42:39.434 --> 42:40.936
I've got it. It's here.

42:43.480 --> 42:46.400
Stand back. Let the matron do her work.

42:47.067 --> 42:49.152
Stop ignoring my calls, Grace.

42:51.029 --> 42:52.739
Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.

42:56.285 --> 42:57.536
Oh, shit.

42:58.078 --> 43:00.205
It's Bibi. Hey, what's up?

43:00.289 --> 43:01.748
<i>He's back already.</i>
-He's what?

43:01.832 --> 43:02.833
He's fucking here.

43:02.833 --> 43:06.837
But if you don't come home right now,
God knows what I'll do.

43:10.048 --> 43:11.008
Hurry up.

43:11.592 --> 43:12.926
Fuck!
-Don't.

43:13.010 --> 43:14.261
There. This way. Come on.

43:14.261 --> 43:15.345
Okay.

43:16.638 --> 43:17.639
Don't!

43:18.932 --> 43:21.143
Why've you still got the-- Urs!

43:23.562 --> 43:25.314
Oh, shit.

43:26.148 --> 43:27.149
No!

43:30.444 --> 43:32.279
Can't fit under the bloody--

43:32.821 --> 43:34.072
Move over.

43:34.156 --> 43:35.908
Fuck.
-Just--

43:39.578 --> 43:40.579
Will you be quiet?

43:41.413 --> 43:42.414
Move your foot.

43:42.414 --> 43:43.832
Fine! Shit!

44:10.817 --> 44:11.985
Becka?

44:12.736 --> 44:13.904
Did you fart?

44:15.447 --> 44:17.282
Oh, my God. What's the matter with you?

44:17.366 --> 44:19.576
My stomach hurts when I get nervous.

44:20.410 --> 44:21.703
He's gonna smell that.

44:44.017 --> 44:46.854
And good night.

44:49.398 --> 44:51.400
Come on! He's passed out.

44:51.942 --> 44:52.985
My tits.

44:55.654 --> 44:56.655
Sorry.

45:06.623 --> 45:08.208
Why are you crawling like that?

45:19.094 --> 45:20.262
Is he even breathing?

45:26.059 --> 45:27.060
Just.

45:29.146 --> 45:30.606
Must've been quite a dose.

45:31.690 --> 45:34.109
Okay. The bath's running.

45:36.236 --> 45:37.237
Dibs on taking an arm.

45:37.988 --> 45:40.699
I bet the prick's got heavy legs.
He's built like a brick shithouse.

45:41.825 --> 45:45.204
What the h-- Why would you-- What?
-What?

45:45.204 --> 45:48.290
Why'd you do that that now?
-He has to go in naked.

45:48.290 --> 45:49.750
Why would you start there?

45:49.750 --> 45:51.168
Oh, my God.

45:52.127 --> 45:54.129
Oh, come on. Just-- Come on. Let's get--

45:54.213 --> 45:56.632
Open his bloody stupid buttons.
-I can't.

46:14.608 --> 46:15.651
What the hell?

46:15.651 --> 46:18.278
Gerald should be here any moment.

46:18.362 --> 46:19.571
What is he doing?

46:24.451 --> 46:25.994
Is he pissing?

46:26.870 --> 46:29.039
What the fuck is going on?
-Is it not working?

46:29.039 --> 46:30.123
I don't know.

46:30.207 --> 46:32.751
He's peeing.
-He's having a slash.

47:07.411 --> 47:09.580
What is happening?
-He's gonna drive.

47:09.580 --> 47:10.831
Just--

47:10.831 --> 47:12.374
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

47:12.374 --> 47:14.877
He just took a wee in the closet.
-Come on!

47:23.177 --> 47:24.928
We're not seriously going after him,
are we?

47:26.054 --> 47:28.307
Someone knock the bath off.
Knock the bath off!

47:29.099 --> 47:31.435
Eva? That's not a no?
-Shut up and run!

47:34.938 --> 47:37.149
Wait!
-Come on!

47:37.816 --> 47:39.401
Where the hell is he going?

47:39.401 --> 47:40.903
Hope we've got a plan B.

47:40.903 --> 47:43.614
Yeah. Catch up with him
before he bloody kills someone.

47:44.114 --> 47:45.240
Get in the car.

47:45.324 --> 47:47.034
Get in.
-I'm getting in.

47:47.034 --> 47:48.118
Jesus!

47:48.202 --> 47:50.704
Move your arse, Ursula.
-I am. Yeah, okay.

47:51.288 --> 47:53.207
Oh, my God. He's gonna hit that bri--

47:53.874 --> 47:55.250
Should we call the police?

47:55.334 --> 47:57.127
What if he's calling the police?

47:57.920 --> 47:59.630
Oh, God. He's stopping.

48:01.381 --> 48:02.382
He stopped.

48:05.802 --> 48:07.387
I gave him a massive dose.

48:07.471 --> 48:09.473
It should've knocked out
a fucking elephant.

48:10.140 --> 48:11.266
Oh, my God.

48:14.311 --> 48:15.854
What's his plan?

48:15.938 --> 48:17.481
Is that his stupid boat?

48:21.485 --> 48:22.861
What is he doing?

48:23.362 --> 48:26.031
I am correct in remembering
he can't swim, right?

48:29.660 --> 48:30.661
Yeah.

48:43.298 --> 48:45.175
Is he taking the boat out?
-I don't know.

48:47.761 --> 48:49.388
For the love of God!
-Gross.

48:49.388 --> 48:50.556
Vile.

48:53.976 --> 48:55.352
Fuck me.

48:55.352 --> 48:56.645
There was no need for that.

49:00.524 --> 49:04.278
J-- Oh, my God. He's fallen in!
-That's what we want, you silly cow.

49:06.655 --> 49:08.407
Oh, yeah.

49:14.580 --> 49:18.041
Well, I guess a win is a win. Right?

49:20.085 --> 49:21.128
It's happening.
