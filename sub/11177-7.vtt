00:02.080 --> 00:05.360
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.440 --> 00:07.360
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.400
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:16.280
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

00:19.360 --> 00:23.440
<i>Michael Bluth was fed up
with his mother's extravagant spending.</i>

00:23.520 --> 00:26.120
Hey, Mom. Remember we had that
conversation about trying to...

00:26.240 --> 00:28.000
cut back on things
that aren't necessities?

00:28.120 --> 00:30.800
- Like it was yesterday.
- It was this morning...

00:30.880 --> 00:33.400
and now I hear that you've hired
a crew for the yacht.

00:33.520 --> 00:37.000
<i>- I'm selling that yacht.
- Michael, you haven't heard why I want it.</i>

00:37.120 --> 00:41.280
To throw the most lavish party this town
has ever seen for my birthday.

00:41.360 --> 00:44.480
I enjoy bicentennials as much as
the next guy, Mom, but we're not doing that.

00:44.600 --> 00:48.680
My neighbor Lucille Austero is
constantly throwing parties for herself.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.920
- She's having another one in a week.
- I'm not going to that.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.840
<i>Buster had been avoiding
Lucille Austero...</i>

00:53.920 --> 00:58.360
<i>since he accidentally flirted with her
while not wearing his glasses.</i>

00:58.480 --> 01:01.280
<i>And then accidentally bid on her
at a charity bachelorette auction.</i>

01:01.360 --> 01:04.280
- Ten thousand dollars!
- Buster.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.800
<i>And then accidentally entered
her apartment, thinking it was his mother's.</i>

01:07.920 --> 01:09.960
I need you right now.

01:10.080 --> 01:13.120
Fellas, take a powder.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.960
Oh, here comes the 10:15
conniption, right on time.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.756
Honest to God, Buster,
it's like every little

01:17.757 --> 01:19.360
thing makes you seize
up in terror lately.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.080
I have no idea where you get that from.

01:22.160 --> 01:25.200
Get away from that stove.
You're going to light your hair on fire.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.960
He's weak.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.960
Speaking of weak, Mom,
what do you got in there, gold bars?

01:33.680 --> 01:37.080
Protein bars for your father.
He's pumping up in prison.

01:37.200 --> 01:41.440
- No more parties. Okay, Mom?
- You're my third least-favorite child.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.720
I can live with that.

01:43.840 --> 01:47.600
<i>Michael came home to find
his mother's fourth least-favorite child.</i>

01:47.680 --> 01:48.934
- Heard you're selling the yacht.

01:48.935 --> 01:50.720
- Yeah. I had a couple
in there this morning.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.160
Yeah, I know.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.560
Well, they got the Asian right.

01:58.640 --> 02:02.760
"Hotties" might be a stretch.

02:02.880 --> 02:06.280
Well, let's start with the little one.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.840
- You're not staying on the yacht, are you?
- What do you want me to do?

02:09.919 --> 02:13.400
- Live full-time with Marta?
- Or break up with her.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.200
I'm sure there'd be somebody else
out there that would appreciate her.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.320
<i>In fact, Michael felt
that man was himself.</i>

02:18.400 --> 02:22.160
<i>He had become infatuated
with his brother's girlfriend...</i>

02:22.240 --> 02:24.960
<i>and was having difficulty
keeping his love a secret.</i>

02:25.080 --> 02:27.480
You have 48 hours to vacate the yacht.

02:27.600 --> 02:31.880
Guys, I've got a great idea.
I wanna throw Mom a party.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.720
Would you...
I just told Mom no more parties.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.889
I know, Michael. That's
why this is the perfect

02:36.890 --> 02:38.760
opportunity to throw
her a surprise party.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.120
- She'd never suspect it.
- Is this her suggestion?

02:41.200 --> 02:44.960
No. I just think it's important to
honor your parents.

02:45.040 --> 02:48.680
Why don't you start by visiting Dad in jail?
You've never even been there.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.280
Michael, do you have any idea what
would happen if I were to visit prison?

02:52.360 --> 02:54.440
- Hmm.
- It would be pandemonium.

02:54.560 --> 02:54.911
- Mm
-hmm.

02:54.912 --> 02:56.440
- It'd just give Dad one
more reason to think...

02:56.560 --> 02:58.880
that I've got nothing
to offer but my looks.

02:58.960 --> 03:02.720
Yeah, I got some of that...
except he also didn't like my looks.

03:03.920 --> 03:06.600
Okay, Michael. I will go visit Dad...

03:06.720 --> 03:08.600
if you drive Mom to the restaurant
for the surprise party.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.400
I'll just pretend that
I'm taking her out that evening.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.560
- Come on. That would never happen.
- She can't drive herself.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.520
<i>- I mean, she's the world's worst driver.
- Lindsay was not exaggerating.</i>

03:17.600 --> 03:22.360
<i>Lucille had recently been featured on
Fox's World's Worst Drivers.</i>

03:23.920 --> 03:26.280
Yeah. I can't believe she got that
driver's license renewed.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.440
She didn't. I dummied her up a new one.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.200
Not my best work though.
She wanted to look 48.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.760
<i>I nearly airbrushed her into oblivion.</i>

03:33.880 --> 03:36.160
We ended up checking "Albino" on the form.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.640
Come on, Michael. Who knows how long
our parents are going to be around.

03:38.720 --> 03:41.920
I gotta tell ya. I was over at her
place today, and she looked a little frail.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.280
She was having trouble even lifting up
this bag of groceries.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.480
All right. We will do the surprise party.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.080
<i>For Gangy?</i>

03:51.200 --> 03:55.000
- Yeah, how did you know?
- She called and invited us.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.960
- Okay, so it was her idea.
- We don't have to go, do we?

03:59.040 --> 04:02.840
Come on. This is a Bluth family celebration.
It's no place for children.

04:02.960 --> 04:07.680
<i>And Lindsay went to the prison
to visit her father for the first time.</i>

04:07.800 --> 04:10.200
<i>But didn't get the reception
she was expecting.</i>

04:12.000 --> 04:14.880
<i>I wanna thank you for coming here.
It took a lot of guts.</i>

04:15.000 --> 04:19.200
The reason I'm here today is because
I felt that I needed to say something.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.600
- Oh, okay.
- My whole life...

04:21.680 --> 04:24.080
all you've ever praised me for is my looks.

04:24.160 --> 04:26.560
- Oh, no. Your looks...
- Yes, Dad.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.160
I mean, it's always been
Michael's got the brains...

04:29.280 --> 04:32.800
Gob's got the charm,
Buster's got the...

04:34.000 --> 04:36.520
- High-fastening pants.
- Have you said that?

04:36.640 --> 04:38.480
No. I'm saying that now.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.560
So, anyway. Look, if you're wondering why
I haven't visited...

04:41.680 --> 04:44.880
maybe it's because I wanted to be thought
of as more than just a beautiful face.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.840
And a gorgeous head of hair.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.800
<i>Lindsay was surprised once
again that no heads were turned.</i>

04:55.680 --> 04:59.560
I'm gonna go shopping.
I'll be back tomorrow.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.840
<i>George Michael was finally
moving beyond his crush on Maeby...</i>

05:04.960 --> 05:07.200
<i>and felt happy to have a cousin
he couldjust see a movie with.</i>

05:07.320 --> 05:12.320
<i>It was a love between two cousins
that the world thought was wrong.</i>

05:12.400 --> 05:17.640
<i>But it was the world that was wrong.</i>

05:17.760 --> 05:20.000
- We have got to see this movie.
- Excuse me, kids?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.160
Can I see your I.D.'s?

05:26.160 --> 05:29.080
<i>And Michael was driving his
mother to her surprise party.</i>

05:29.200 --> 05:32.520
Where on earth are we going?

05:32.640 --> 05:35.480
Left at the next corner.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.440
- You know, Michael?
- Yeah?

05:37.520 --> 05:39.720
I'd be happy to drive if you want me to.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.960
It's better than sitting here
with Buster's stupid rock behind me.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.960
<i>Buster had recently
brought the rock home...</i>

05:45.040 --> 05:49.000
<i>from an archeological dig, but had yet
to find a way to get it out of the car.</i>

05:49.120 --> 05:51.680
Mom, you've already got
two strikes on your record.

05:51.800 --> 05:55.040
You strike one more person,
and it's technically a spree.

05:56.960 --> 06:01.400
Are we going to the back?
Is this what I think it is?

06:01.520 --> 06:05.760
<i>- Surprise!
- And she was surprised...</i>

06:05.840 --> 06:10.680
<i>- that her family didn't show up.
- So this is what my children think of me.</i>

06:23.120 --> 06:25.600
Where the... was everybody?

06:25.720 --> 06:28.320
- What are you talking about?
- Mom's party. Where were you guys?

06:29.360 --> 06:31.200
It's the first I've heard about it.

06:32.240 --> 06:36.360
- What about you? Neiman's?
- Prison.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.760
Then Neiman's. But only because I'm going
back to prison, and they've seen me in this.

06:40.880 --> 06:44.840
Buster? You of all people.
Where were you, buddy?

06:44.960 --> 06:46.720
You barely even leave Mom's apartment.

06:46.800 --> 06:50.480
<i>In fact, Buster was worried
about running into Lucille 2.</i>

06:50.560 --> 06:52.520
<i>So he never left his mother's apartment.</i>

06:52.640 --> 06:57.240
<i>Lucille 2 was also supposed to go, but
was waiting until she saw Buster emerge.</i>

07:01.440 --> 07:04.360
Tonight, Mother was humiliated.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.160
And I wanna throw her another
surprise party... a real one.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.480
One where she's not the one
that's yelling "Surprise. "

07:09.600 --> 07:12.880
<i>- Mom yelled "Surprise"?
- Yeah. She went from giddy to devastated.</i>

07:12.960 --> 07:15.400
I mean, it would've been funny
if it wasn't so...

07:15.520 --> 07:17.680
Well, it was kind of funny.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.800
What frail act got you this time, Michael?

07:19.920 --> 07:24.160
She couldn't open a jar? What, did a clump
of her hair come out in your hands?

07:24.280 --> 07:26.880
No. It was something
that she said at dinner.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.480
It's dry.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.040
You know, Mom,
I'm sorry you're upset. But, you know...

07:32.160 --> 07:35.960
if you were nicer, then maybe your kids
would take better care of you, you know?

07:36.080 --> 07:38.440
Or-Or wanna be with you more.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.440
I've been a horrible mother.

07:44.560 --> 07:47.200
No, Mom. You're great.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.520
You've been a great mother.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.682
- Well, you know she's been
a horrible mother, right?

07:51.683 --> 07:52.800
- You don't have to tell me.

07:52.880 --> 07:56.240
But what was I gonna say?
All right? So, it's a party.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.000
I mean, if you're not
gonna do it for Mom, do it for me.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.720
Okay. But I think
a party's a little excessive.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.880
Um, is it okay if I do it for Mom
and not you?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.840
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I really like Mom.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.600
We know.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.960
<i>The next day, Buster decided
it was time to deal with...</i>

08:16.040 --> 08:18.400
<i>the situation with Lucille Austero.</i>

08:18.520 --> 08:21.040
I've already got a Lucille in my life.

08:23.040 --> 08:26.280
I understand. That's healthy.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.440
I didn't mean to lead you on.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.680
- Oh, Buster. I feel so foolish.
- No.

08:31.760 --> 08:36.039
Yes. I'm foolish
and I'm funny and I'm needy.

08:36.159 --> 08:38.240
- Am I needy?
- No.

08:38.360 --> 08:41.520
Are you sure I'm not needy?
'Cause I feel needy sometimes.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.480
You know, we're probably
not that different, you and me.

08:44.560 --> 08:47.000
You and I. Is it "I" or is it "me"?

08:47.120 --> 08:51.760
- Buster, it's us.
- Yes. It is us. Us.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.440
<i>Under the pretense of driving
his mother somewhere else...</i>

09:07.520 --> 09:09.600
<i>Michael, once again,
arrived at the restaurant.</i>

09:09.720 --> 09:12.160
Michael, did you do this again?

09:12.280 --> 09:16.000
<i>- Surprise!
- And once again, no one showed up.</i>

09:16.080 --> 09:17.920
<i>Get up.</i>

09:18.880 --> 09:22.400
I told you. They don't support me.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.720
I hate to tell you, Mom,
but they don't support me either.

09:24.800 --> 09:28.000
I sat down and I told them
this was important to me.

09:29.320 --> 09:34.400
- You did that for me?
- I let you drive, didn't I?

09:34.520 --> 09:37.840
Yes, you did, Michael, and I'm loving it.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.240
You're a good son.
You always do things for others.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.520
You're the only one
holding this family together.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.040
And you see a lot more than
I give you credit for, Mom.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.480
You're not just concerned with yourself.
You care about the family.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.600
Hey. Is that Gob?

09:52.720 --> 09:56.120
<i>It's an idiot on a scooter
at night? It's gotta be Gob.</i>

09:56.240 --> 09:59.240
- Let's give him a scare.
- Hmm?

09:59.360 --> 10:02.880
- No, Mom. I don't think we should.
- A nice little scare.

10:02.960 --> 10:08.160
Hey, big shot, too busy to
go to your mother's party?

10:08.280 --> 10:11.760
<i>Mom, that is not Gob. Mom! Mom!</i>

10:22.480 --> 10:25.960
You okay, sir?

10:26.080 --> 10:29.320
Yeah. I guess.
How's my mom? She's so frail.

10:29.440 --> 10:33.240
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I was thrown clear.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.000
I only care about you.

10:42.560 --> 10:46.080
- How are you feeling?
- Actually, my head does not hurt at all.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.449
- What did you give me?

10:47.450 --> 10:50.000
- Your mother asked me
to pump you full of...

10:50.080 --> 10:53.760
- Children's aspirin.
- Okay.

10:53.880 --> 10:57.840
You know, it's funny.
I remember, um, leaving the restaurant.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.640
And then, uh, I was driving, I guess.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.800
I- I just... I cannot picture it.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.440
That's pretty common, actually.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.960
It's just short-term memory loss from
the bump on the back of your head.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.257
I can't believe I did this.

11:09.258 --> 11:11.480
My insurance rates are
gonna go through the roof.

11:11.600 --> 11:15.840
That's not what matters now.
Here, get comfortable. Scoot up.

11:15.960 --> 11:19.360
"Scoot"? Scooter.
Was there a scooter involved?

11:19.480 --> 11:23.240
Oh, dear.
I can't believe I did that.

11:23.360 --> 11:26.360
- I am so sorry. I'll get you some air.
- I hardly felt it.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.200
In fact, actually, uh,
I didn't feel it.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.600
What was that?

11:35.120 --> 11:38.480
Buster, you remember
when we were kissing last night?

11:38.560 --> 11:42.720
It was a wild, wild ride.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.320
But is this something we can do?

11:45.440 --> 11:48.280
Is this something society will allow?

11:48.360 --> 11:50.760
I don't care what other people think.

11:50.880 --> 11:56.120
My God, for the first time in years
I felt like I was standing on solid ground.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.400
You know,
my panic attacks have decreased.

11:59.520 --> 12:03.960
I feel confident. I'm feeling proud even.

12:04.040 --> 12:07.720
I mean, for the first time
in my life...

12:13.280 --> 12:15.240
I'll call Dr. Miller.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.360
Oh. Excuse me.

12:18.440 --> 12:22.720
Hello. Oh, my God.
I'm getting my gauze.

12:22.840 --> 12:26.160
You know, I should call George Michael.
I'm worried about my son.

12:26.240 --> 12:30.000
<i>I'm worried about my son. George Michael
will be fine with his aunt and uncle.</i>

12:30.080 --> 12:33.400
<i>I want you resting, not using the phone.</i>

12:33.520 --> 12:35.039
- Let me take care of you.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.720
- You know, you really are more
generous than I can remember.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.680
But that's what a parent does, huh?
You put your kid first?

12:43.960 --> 12:46.400
Rest up, sweetie.
You gave me quite a scare.

12:48.440 --> 12:52.160
Scare. Did somebody say,
"Let's give him a sc... "

12:52.280 --> 12:57.040
What is the matter with me?
Clumsy Clara.

12:57.120 --> 13:00.440
Totally cool. Didn't feel a thing.
You know, Mom, I'm crazy about this aspirin.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.520
I can't believe we give it to children.

13:03.640 --> 13:07.160
<i>Gob, meanwhile, was being
visited by Michael's son, George Michael.</i>

13:07.240 --> 13:09.240
<i>Michael? George Michael.</i>

13:09.320 --> 13:11.800
<i>- You've gotta go.
- Wait.</i>

13:11.880 --> 13:14.400
Uncle Gob, is this a bad time?

13:14.520 --> 13:17.680
No. Are you kidding? So, what's up?

13:17.760 --> 13:21.040
I, uh, need you to make
some fake I.D.'s for me and Maeby.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.840
- Like a passport?
- Yeah, yeah. That'd be great.

13:23.920 --> 13:27.800
Oh, and, uh, preferably French.
I like the way they think.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.865
Look, I don't want you
thinking that your uncle

13:29.866 --> 13:31.560
is some sleazy character from the docks.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.040
- Good morning.
- How are you?

13:35.760 --> 13:39.240
She's an Olympian... hopeful.

13:39.360 --> 13:43.960
Swimming and some coaching.
Yes, I will make the I.D.'s for you.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.040
But we're gonna have to make this quick.
Your dad wants me out of here by noon.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.600
I wouldn't worry about him.
He's staying at Gangy's.

13:48.680 --> 13:50.680
Yeah, he got in a car accident on the way
back from her birthday party.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.120
- Man, I told him not to let her drive.
- No. It was him driving.

13:53.240 --> 13:56.800
She's taking good care of him too.
She won't even let him use the phone.

13:56.920 --> 14:00.640
<i>- So you're telling me that he can't
go anywhere and he's incommunicado?</i>

14:00.641 --> 14:01.080
- Right.

14:01.160 --> 14:04.480
<i>That's when Gob decided to take
the yacht to South America for the summer.</i>

14:04.600 --> 14:07.840
I gotta alert this boat's crew.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.920
They'll be devastated.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.720
<i>Lindsay put on her new outfit
and returned to prison.</i>

14:24.000 --> 14:27.800
<i>Back at Lucille's, Michael was still
piecing together the accident.</i>

14:27.920 --> 14:30.600
- Hey, Buster.
- Hey, brother.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.840
- Dr. Miller?
- Yeah.

14:34.920 --> 14:39.200
I just jumped through a plate glass window
on a date.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.160
Oh. Well, women love to laugh.

14:41.280 --> 14:45.600
It was worth it to be away from
Mom's controlling grasp.

14:45.720 --> 14:49.800
<i>Buster, what's going on?
What happened to your head?</i>

14:49.920 --> 14:53.360
Nothing. Gob was just teaching me
how to hit it with a hammer.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.840
Gob was there.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.440
Gob was on his scooter.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.360
I think I wanted to hit Gob.

15:00.480 --> 15:05.000
Yes. That is exactly what happened.
You wanted to give Gob a scare.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.840
I don't know why.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.080
I think I do.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.960
Thanks, Mom.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.080
<i>George Sr. was once again
being visited by his daughter.</i>

15:22.160 --> 15:24.200
That's it. I don't want...
You can't... I don't...

15:24.320 --> 15:26.200
Please, you gotta stop coming here.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.160
It is obvious I'm not wearing a bra, right?

15:28.280 --> 15:33.360
I can't take this anymore. I, um...
Uh, I'm paying far too big a price for this.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.520
Well, what about me?
This is the third time I've come here.

15:36.640 --> 15:40.520
- I haven't even been remotely harassed.
- That is not what I'm paying for.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.600
Have I lost it?
Did I ever even have it?

15:43.680 --> 15:45.720
I'm paying thousands
of dollars in Krugerrands.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.000
- What?
- Gold. Krugerrands.

15:48.080 --> 15:52.040
Your mother snuck 'em in here
stuffed in energy bar wrappers...

15:52.160 --> 15:55.920
to keep me from getting
strangled in the shower or worse.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.200
- Stabbed?
- In a way.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.280
I used them to pay off
the other guys.

16:02.400 --> 16:07.160
To stop them from hollering
obscenities at my... my little girl.

16:07.280 --> 16:11.520
But you keep coming back here, honey,
and I'm going broke.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.640
That's all I ever wanted from you, Daddy.

16:17.760 --> 16:20.000
For you to spend money on me.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.600
<i>No touching!</i>

16:24.880 --> 16:27.400
Gob, I want you to
move back on to the yacht.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.520
The yacht? What makes you think
I'd want to now?

16:30.600 --> 16:32.480
Well, I know that
you've been looking for...

16:32.560 --> 16:33.920
What was that?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.880
I think that was on your end.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.118
The truth is, I can wait
on selling the yacht.

16:38.119 --> 16:39.200
It's just money, right?

16:39.320 --> 16:41.840
Wow. How hard did you hit
that steering wheel?

16:41.920 --> 16:44.920
- I actually hit the back of my head.
- The back of your head?

16:45.040 --> 16:48.600
Yeah. Gob, the accident
only happened because...

16:48.680 --> 16:51.040
I was trying to scare you.

16:51.160 --> 16:54.080
- Maybe even hurt you.
- That doesn't sound like you.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.000
It sounds like Mom.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.720
Can we please just lay
off Mom for a change?

16:58.840 --> 17:01.010
She's the one that helped
me remember what happened.

17:01.011 --> 17:02.280
I'm the bad guy here. Not her.

17:02.400 --> 17:07.040
And definitely not you,
so, would you please just take the yacht?

17:07.160 --> 17:09.599
I'll think about it.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.760
South America sounds good.

17:14.880 --> 17:18.040
But a chance to expose Mom?

17:18.119 --> 17:22.240
- Turn this skiff around.
- We haven't even left the dock.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.960
But "skiff" is appropriate, right?

17:26.079 --> 17:29.600
<i>Gob rushed to shore
to spare his brother...</i>

17:29.720 --> 17:31.760
<i>from what he was certain
were his mother's machinations.</i>

17:31.840 --> 17:34.720
<i>- What are you doing?
- Hey. Open this door.</i>

17:34.800 --> 17:36.680
<i>- You've been set up.
- Michael!</i>

17:36.800 --> 17:39.480
There's no way you were trying to hurt me.
You don't hate me.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.040
Mom hates me.
You kind of like me.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.720
- Yeah. I kind of like you.
- Yeah.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.560
<i>- Michael, I need your help.
- Coming.</i>

17:46.640 --> 17:49.440
- Ow! I got hit back there.
- Right!

17:49.560 --> 17:52.720
On the back of the head, which means that
you couldn't have hit the steering wheel.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.680
Mom must have clubbed you with a champagne
bottle or something so she could drive.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.320
- Gob, how'd you figure it out?
- It's funny you should ask that...

17:58.400 --> 18:00.640
No. He didn't figure anything out.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.680
I probably got hit on the back of the head
because of Buster's rock.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.640
Hey, big shot!

18:07.920 --> 18:09.960
Which was behind the passenger seat.

18:10.080 --> 18:14.080
Which means that she picked you up
and dragged you over to the driver's seat.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.440
Mom can't pick me up. She could barely
pick up that bag of protein bars.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.480
<i>Guess what? They weren't protein bars.</i>

18:20.560 --> 18:22.081
They were gold Krugerrands.

18:22.082 --> 18:24.840
And Dad finally paid
attention to my intellect.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.520
- Open this door!
- Gob, this is nuts.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.160
Mother is frail.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.800
- Stop this nonsense this instant!
- You set him up, Mom.

18:31.920 --> 18:35.080
I was halfway to South America,
but I couldn't let you get away with it...

18:35.200 --> 18:38.520
because we're brothers, Mom,
and we kind of like each other.

18:40.640 --> 18:43.920
- You were going to South America?
- I don't think so.

18:46.320 --> 18:49.000
Mom, you and I were getting along so well.
I was thinking so highly of you.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.600
How could you make me think
this was all my fault?

18:51.680 --> 18:53.920
Because if you knew it was my fault,
you would've turned against me.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.160
And I had finally gotten you on my side.
You were sticking up for me.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.400
I- I don't even remember
you ever doing that before.

19:00.480 --> 19:03.080
I just want my children to love me.

19:03.200 --> 19:07.160
<i>Stop lying. Stop manipulating.
Just be nicer.</i>

19:07.280 --> 19:09.240
But...

19:16.120 --> 19:18.000
You're right.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.120
I'm a horrible mother.

19:28.600 --> 19:32.160
- No, no, Mom. You're great.
- That's crazy talk.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.560
- You're a fantastic mother.
- I can't believe what I'm hearing, Mother.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.760
Oh, we do. We really love you.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.760
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

19:38.880 --> 19:42.840
<i>George Michael and Maeby sneak back
into Les Cousins Dangereux.</i>

19:42.920 --> 19:45.600
Excuse me. You're too young to be
holding that ticket.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.280
- Let's go.
- I can't go to jail.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.480
<i>- Let's just watch cartoons.</i>

19:48.481 --> 19:50.360
- Sir, we will not be
starting with Les Cousins...

19:50.480 --> 19:53.960
- until you leave.
- Excuse me, but I thought my A.A.R.P. card...

19:54.080 --> 19:55.236
- was good for one and a guest.

19:55.237 --> 19:55.844
- You know what?

19:55.845 --> 19:57.400
I knew society would never accept this.

19:57.480 --> 20:02.240
<i>And they never will.
- Michael's insurance takes another hit.</i>

20:05.560 --> 20:09.520
Ow!

20:09.600 --> 20:12.200
I was definitely driving that time.
