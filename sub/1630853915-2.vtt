[cheers and applause]

01:08.335 --> 01:10.337

01:11.805 --> 01:13.740
You look fabulous, oh, my God.

- Hi, everyone.

01:20.313 --> 01:21.514
- Thank you both

01:21.548 --> 01:23.516
Now I know you made
some friends backstage...

01:23.550 --> 01:24.517
- That's right.
- So please introduce us

01:24.551 --> 01:25.652
to your teammates. Jimmy.

01:25.685 --> 01:28.254
- My teammate right here
is Kanissa

01:28.288 --> 01:29.356
and she's from Arizona.

01:29.389 --> 01:30.890
- Okay, Kanissa.
- Give it up for Kanissa.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.325
- Kanissa, tell me a little bit
about yourself.

01:32.359 --> 01:34.461
What would you do with
the 25 grand if you win today?

01:34.494 --> 01:37.197
- I'm going to CancÃºn
with me and my man.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.367
We've been married
for 15 long years.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.469
- Yeah.
- In my two-piece bikini

01:42.502 --> 01:44.404
with my stretch marks,
and we gonna do it.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.406
- Come on now!
[cheers and applause]

01:46.439 --> 01:47.407
Yes!

01:47.440 --> 01:49.676
- Holla!
[overlapping chatter]

01:49.709 --> 01:50.744
- Two...
- Incredible.

01:50.777 --> 01:51.745
- Whoo!
- Two-piece bikini.

01:51.778 --> 01:52.946
Let's do a two-piece.
- Hey.

01:52.979 --> 01:54.247
- Now Heidi, who you playing
with today?

01:54.280 --> 01:55.415
- I'm playing with Cole today.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.883
And I know you have a library

01:56.916 --> 01:58.218
at home with over 400 books,

01:58.251 --> 02:00.687
but you love dragons
and you have a dragon dance,

02:00.720 --> 02:01.755
and I kinda want to see that.

02:01.788 --> 02:02.822
Will you show--
- Can I show you?

02:02.856 --> 02:04.057
- Please!
- Wait a minute.

02:04.057 --> 02:06.326
- What?
- He does this dragon dance--

02:06.359 --> 02:08.194
- Dragons? So we gonna do
Dungeons & Dragons?

02:08.228 --> 02:09.462
- All right. It's two steps.
Two steps.

02:09.496 --> 02:10.563
- Yes.
- You start--

02:10.597 --> 02:11.765
warm up the wingies.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.633
Back.
- [laughing] Yeah.

02:13.667 --> 02:14.968
[cheers and applause]

02:15.068 --> 02:16.269
- Back.
- And you know what dragons

02:16.302 --> 02:18.204
are famous for.
- Forth.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.606
- We breathe fire!

02:19.639 --> 02:21.708
- All right! I like this.

02:21.741 --> 02:24.177
Got one, two, the fire!

02:24.210 --> 02:26.446
- Okay.
- [laughs]

02:26.479 --> 02:27.981
- So thank you, guys,
for being here.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.082
We're all very excited

02:29.082 --> 02:31.618
because we're all here
to play...

02:31.651 --> 02:33.687
all: "Password"!

02:33.720 --> 02:36.089
[cheers and applause]

02:36.122 --> 02:37.824
- Yes!
- Whoo!

02:37.857 --> 02:40.593
- Now the rules are simple,
okay?

02:40.627 --> 02:42.529
I'll hand two of you
a password,

02:42.562 --> 02:44.497
and then
you'll give a one-word clue

02:44.531 --> 02:46.700
to get your partner
to guess the password.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.635
- The password
is worth 6 points

02:48.668 --> 02:50.437
if you can get it
on the first clue.

02:50.470 --> 02:53.707
5 points on the second clue
and so on and so on.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.976
The first team to 15 points
wins game one

02:57.010 --> 02:58.945
in this best-out-of-three
battle.

02:58.978 --> 03:01.481
Now if a clue is determined
illegal by our judges--

03:01.514 --> 03:03.350
'cause I'm listening in
on my line--

03:03.383 --> 03:04.617
you will hear this sound.

03:04.651 --> 03:06.052
<i>[buzzer chirps]</i>

03:06.052 --> 03:07.387
And you will forfeit
your turn,

03:07.420 --> 03:10.490
so don't say multiple words
or use gestures--

03:10.523 --> 03:12.625
pretty much, no cheating.

03:12.659 --> 03:14.094
Are y'all ready to play?
- Yup.

03:14.127 --> 03:15.328
- Let's play!

03:15.362 --> 03:17.063
[cheers and applause]

03:17.097 --> 03:19.065
All right.
One for you.

03:19.065 --> 03:21.334
- It's gonna be hard,
but I try my best.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.736
- Now Jimmy, you start us out.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.604
Are you playing or passing?
You get the choice

03:24.637 --> 03:25.705
if you wanna start it out.
- Okay. Here we go.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.341
<i>- The password is "diamond."</i>

03:28.375 --> 03:31.411
[audience oohing]

03:32.512 --> 03:33.813
- I'm gonna play.
- You playing.

03:33.847 --> 03:34.814
Playing.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.416
He's playing!
- I feel good.

03:36.449 --> 03:37.584
- You're good.
- I feel good.

03:37.617 --> 03:38.651
- We're good!
- I feel good!

03:38.685 --> 03:39.986
- I do too!
- All right.

03:41.087 --> 03:42.322
Ready?
- I'm ready.

03:42.355 --> 03:45.525
- [giggles] I think we got
the 6 points right here.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.461
Diamond.

03:48.495 --> 03:49.529
Oops.
- Oh!

03:49.562 --> 03:50.697
<i>[buzzer chirps]</i>
Jimmy.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.966
[laughter]

03:52.999 --> 03:54.167
Jimmy.
- [cheering]

03:54.200 --> 03:55.935
- Now Jimmy.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.104
Now Jimmy, what's going on?

03:58.138 --> 04:00.540
[cheers and applause]

04:00.573 --> 04:02.042
Jimmy.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.410
Jimmy done said the word.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.512
- It's a great clue.
- That means,

04:05.545 --> 04:07.047
because Jimmy said the word,

04:07.047 --> 04:08.615
not only
does he forfeit his turn

04:08.648 --> 04:12.052
and that password completely,
but also you guys get 2 points.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.253
- Let's go, Heidi!

04:13.286 --> 04:14.454
[cheers and applause]

04:14.487 --> 04:15.455
- All right.
- All right.

04:15.488 --> 04:16.589
We're gonna start again.

04:16.623 --> 04:18.258
- Exactly.
- And then you, Kanissa.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.359
- Thank you, boo.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.161
- Since you're trailing,
you get to decide

04:21.194 --> 04:23.063
if you wanna pass
or if you wanna play.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.632
<i>- The password is "ritz."</i>

04:25.665 --> 04:27.300
[audience oohing]

04:27.334 --> 04:29.269
- I'm gonna pass.
- Okay.

04:29.302 --> 04:30.704
- We got this.

04:30.737 --> 04:31.738
- Keep it simple.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.807
English
is not my first language.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.709
- She had to let us know.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.480
- Carlton.

04:40.513 --> 04:41.681
- Hotel?

04:41.715 --> 04:43.249
audience: Ooh.
- That's not the password.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.784
- What was that face
you were making?

04:44.818 --> 04:47.253
- You were like, "Oh, this
is gonna be great with her."

04:47.287 --> 04:48.555
- No, no, no.
- All right.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.357
We're back to you,
Kanissa and Jimmy.

04:50.390 --> 04:53.727
- Mm-hmm.
- The clue was "Carlton."

04:53.760 --> 04:55.829
For 5 points...

04:55.862 --> 04:56.863
- Crackers.

04:56.896 --> 04:58.398
[audience gasps]
- [gasps]

05:01.401 --> 05:03.303
- Crackers.

05:03.336 --> 05:05.038
- Whoo!

05:05.071 --> 05:07.340

You know what's up.
You know what's up.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.516

I'ma let y'all know
right now...

05:21.321 --> 05:22.622
- Whoo!
- What Jimmy just did,

05:22.655 --> 05:24.391
he's saying
that this is his house.

05:24.424 --> 05:25.458
- Whoa!
[cheers and applause]

05:25.492 --> 05:26.659
- That's right!

05:26.693 --> 05:28.428
- Y'all can't let him get away
with this.

05:28.461 --> 05:30.330
Y'all gotta get your head
in the game.

05:30.363 --> 05:31.331
- We're moving in.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.332
- Come on, Heidi.

05:32.365 --> 05:33.900
I know you got it in you.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.301
Here you go, Jimmy.
- All right. Thank you.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.670
- Now you guys are now

<i>- The password is "zombie."</i>

- Michael.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.555

That's not the password.

All right, we're going back

06:05.598 --> 06:07.834

- Dead.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.837
The clues were "thriller"
and [gruffly] "dead."

[laughter]

06:14.374 --> 06:16.042

- Is a morgue that thrilling?

06:18.945 --> 06:20.447
[laughter]

06:20.480 --> 06:23.616
- Back to you, Cole.
For 4 points.

06:23.650 --> 06:26.052
It would put you guys back
into the lead.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.122
[laughs]

06:29.155 --> 06:30.457
You could cut the tension
with a butter knife.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.107
- Yes!
- Oh, my goodness.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.208
That's illegal.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.409
You shouldn't be able
to do that.

06:49.442 --> 06:50.744
That is illegal.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.512
You shouldn't be able to do it.

06:52.545 --> 06:54.247
- We got a game.
- It's my house now!

06:54.280 --> 06:56.549
- Oh! "It's my house now!"

a little bit ahead.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.891
- It's okay.
- That's not the password.

the bonus round works.

You'll have 30 seconds

18:01.381 --> 18:03.717

as you can.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.752
Then we'll take a break,
catch our breath,

18:05.785 --> 18:07.454
and the other celebrity
will take over

18:07.487 --> 18:09.255
to guess
the remaining passwords.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.857
- We'll try.
- For every correct answer,

18:10.890 --> 18:12.826
you'll get a grand,
but if you sweep the board

18:12.859 --> 18:14.027

we'll have you go home

That's actually two words.

If you get this next one, Lisa,
then you've won this round.

33:32.312 --> 33:33.546
- That's right.

33:33.580 --> 33:35.749
- That would be
a tiebreaker moment.

for me,

33:37.384 --> 33:39.652

- For you, Jimmy.

33:42.255 --> 33:43.423

on "Vogue"?

34:39.779 --> 34:41.815
That's a good question.

38:00.146 --> 38:02.382
but I actually didn't finish
my bachelor's degree.

38:02.415 --> 38:03.883

you get 1,000.

go with first?
