WEBVTT

00:05.705 --> 00:07.241
Previously on ER:

00:07.275 --> 00:08.609
Ah!

00:08.642 --> 00:10.144
It's over.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.579
It's time for me
to cut my losses.

00:11.612 --> 00:12.580
That's my brother.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.282
A bullet ripped
his spleen.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.649
Stay strong, little man, okay?

00:15.683 --> 00:16.517
Where you going, Curtis?

00:16.550 --> 00:18.252
Like I said, fix things.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.654
Now you see why I
want to get the hell
out of this place.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.489
Well, it's not all bad.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.057
You know what I mean.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.159
You know, you can get a job
at Northwestern, too.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.827
You won't see
me for awhile.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.129
I'm going to the Congo,

00:28.162 --> 00:29.363
West Africa.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.199
L'Alliance de MÃ©decine
Internationale.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.700
I thought you said
you weren't going.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.068
Yeah, I'm not.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.308
WOMAN:
Dr. Carter?

00:40.341 --> 00:43.644
Dr. Carter?

00:43.677 --> 00:45.813
( slurred ):
Start dopamine at ten mikes,

00:45.846 --> 00:46.814
and mix up levophed.

00:46.847 --> 00:49.550
Dr. Carter,
you left a note

00:49.583 --> 00:52.586
to wake you if you
weren't up by 7:00.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.458
Do you want
some breakfast?

00:57.491 --> 01:00.561
No. No, thanks.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.663
I'll just
get something there.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.367
( groaning softly )

01:11.539 --> 01:12.873
Dr. Carter?

01:12.906 --> 01:13.874
I'm up.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.343
( clearing throat )

01:15.376 --> 01:17.411
I'm up.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.722 --> 01:30.791
Mmm.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.598
Hey, you're late.

01:37.631 --> 01:38.599
Two minutes.

01:38.632 --> 01:39.900
Late is late.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.602
57-year-old cirrhosis,
vomit and blood,

01:41.635 --> 01:42.803
G.I. lab can
scope him at 9:00.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.272
Can I get
a bagel first?

01:44.305 --> 01:46.174
I haven't had breakfast
yet, either.

01:46.207 --> 01:46.774
You mean dinner.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.276
Yeah, whatever.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.777
16-year-old gangbanger,
GSW to the belly.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.312
O.R. should be
grabbing him
any minute.

01:51.345 --> 01:52.580
You mean like now?

01:52.613 --> 01:54.182
Then there's
the 14-year-old banger

01:54.182 --> 01:55.383
GSW to the upper leg.

01:55.416 --> 01:56.884
Pulse deficit, in
line for angiogram.

01:56.917 --> 01:57.885
Same shooter?

01:57.918 --> 01:58.919
I stopped keeping track.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.421
DVT in Six;
on heparin.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.389
Since midnight?

02:01.422 --> 02:02.723
There's no tele beds.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.425
This gang war's
got every department backed up.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.926
Where's Jimmy Carter
when you need him?

02:05.959 --> 02:07.861
Bus full of Texans
with food poisoning

02:07.895 --> 02:09.663
all puking hash browns.
Good morning.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.698
Yeah, for you, maybe.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.200
Apparently, I'm a vampire.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.367
Oh, wow,
you got it so rough.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.702
Three night shifts
in a row.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.704
I been doing graveyard
two weeks straight.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.439
I did my residency,
thank you.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.608
They're insisting
on being discharged

02:20.641 --> 02:23.244
by 2:16 so they can
see the stupid eclipse.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.645
I thought vampires
liked eclipses.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.547
Ah, the moon blocks
out the sun-- big deal.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.249
I've got a billboard
outside my apartment

02:28.282 --> 02:29.283
does the same thing.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.451
Catch you tonight,
Elvira.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.885
Hey, I thought
this was it for you.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.887
Almost. One more night
slumming here with you cats.

02:33.921 --> 02:34.922
Then I'm heading it uptown.

02:38.692 --> 02:39.893
You're late.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.262
You can tell time.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.630
So can Dr. Carter.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.732
Yeah? So, what's he
going to do, fire me?

02:44.765 --> 02:45.899
Did you catch the eclipse?

02:45.933 --> 02:47.268
What?

02:47.301 --> 02:47.968
The solar eclipse.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.437
A celestial phenomenon

02:49.470 --> 02:51.239
that occurs only
once every 18 years,

02:51.239 --> 02:52.240
11 and a third days.

02:52.240 --> 02:52.906
No, I slept through that.

02:52.940 --> 02:53.974
You slept through it?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.476
I had to sleep sometime.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.545
You couldn't wake
up for ten minutes?

02:57.578 --> 02:58.579
So, big deal--

02:58.612 --> 02:59.847
the moon
blocks out the sun.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.649
I've got a billboard
outside my apartment

03:01.682 --> 03:02.616
that does the same thing.

03:02.650 --> 03:03.784
You don't look so good.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.586
12-year-old near-drowning
in Four.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.755
Intubated and comatose,
no purposeful movements.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.257
Waiting on PICU.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.924
Hey, what's with
all the Buddhists?

03:10.958 --> 03:12.393
They're here for the nun.

03:12.426 --> 03:13.861
What, so now we got
some religious turf war?

03:13.894 --> 03:15.429
Buddhist nun.

03:15.463 --> 03:16.964
Transpo's backed up
taking her to the morgue.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.399
She's dead.

03:18.432 --> 03:20.268
Reincarnated;
a cycle of karma...

03:20.301 --> 03:21.635
Six-year-old gone
respiratory arrest

03:21.669 --> 03:23.371
from cyanide toxicity.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.373
Acidosis is resolved with
induced methemglobinemia.

03:25.406 --> 03:26.574
Also waiting on PICU.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.276
How does a six-year-old
ingest cyanide?

03:28.276 --> 03:31.011
CARTER:
That is the family
of a fatal M.I.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.281
They want to go in
and see their father

03:33.281 --> 03:34.482
after he gets
cleaned up.

03:34.515 --> 03:35.649
You okay?

03:35.683 --> 03:37.017
DVT in Six
is waiting on coags.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.986
Hold on; I gave you DVT
this morning.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.688
The guy's been in there
over 20 hours?

03:40.721 --> 03:41.889
So, take care of him.

03:41.922 --> 03:42.923
All right, see you.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.692
Nice knowing you.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.760
I start at Northwestern
next week.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.662
Tonight's it for me.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.933
That's right. Um...

03:52.966 --> 03:54.435
Good luck, Greg.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.670
Yeah, you, too.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.539
Do you realize

03:58.572 --> 03:59.640
how much ambulance
traffic

03:59.673 --> 04:00.674
we get through
here a day?

04:00.708 --> 04:04.612
I can't go around?

04:04.645 --> 04:06.647
It's equipment
or a huge pile of concrete.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.316
Hey, park the damn thing
sideways...!

04:08.349 --> 04:09.450
What is this?

04:09.483 --> 04:10.584
Weaver's
moving triage.

04:10.618 --> 04:11.885
Something about
four more beds.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.754
Oh, good-- so the patients
can wait lying down?

04:13.787 --> 04:14.822
I don't ask.

04:14.855 --> 04:15.923
I thought you were on vacation.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.491
Tomorrow.

04:17.524 --> 04:18.992
Martha's Vineyard?
Nope.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.827
32-year-old woman
struck by a cab.

04:20.861 --> 04:21.894
The Cape?

04:21.928 --> 04:22.963
Rio de Janeiro.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.332
Ooh-la-la-- string bikinis.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.766
With my father.
Low velocity.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.000
She ran
right into traffic.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.436
There were others;
not just me.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.470
Any head trauma?

04:29.503 --> 04:30.538
Proximal tibia
on the right.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.439
Could all be
supratentorial.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.640
They were forcing us.

04:32.673 --> 04:33.741
They wanted everyone
to go together.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.509
Are you taking
any medications?

04:35.543 --> 04:37.044
It's all ending today;
today's the last day.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.412
Can you tell us your name?

04:38.446 --> 04:41.649
2:16 P.M.-- the
end of the world.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.016
Oh, great-- and I have to work.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.353
I'm always working
when the world ends.

05:35.969 --> 05:36.770
I can't swallow, man.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.005
Belly's soft.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.006
Let's type and
cross for four.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.708
Blood bank's almost empty.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.142
The Red Cross doesn't restock
until 9:00.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.477
Okay, first crit's 30.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.778
Let's stick with saline
for now.

05:44.812 --> 05:45.713
Decreased on the right.

05:45.746 --> 05:46.780
32 French.

05:46.814 --> 05:47.815
Why can't I swallow?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.016
Am I dying?

05:49.049 --> 05:50.484
Not if we can help it,

05:50.518 --> 05:52.486
but if you guys
keep shooting at each other,

05:52.520 --> 05:53.754
we're going
to run out of blood.

05:53.787 --> 05:54.822
I didn't shoot nobody.

05:54.855 --> 05:55.956
Dr. Carter, I think

05:55.989 --> 05:57.425
you should take a look
at this woman.

05:57.425 --> 05:58.426
Been here half an hour.

05:58.426 --> 05:59.827
I got half
a dozen patients.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.695
You're going to have
to be more specific, Gallant.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.063
Buddhist nun,
end-stage breast cancer.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.064
Vomiting pain meds.
Exam Two.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.033
Does this guy
need to go up?

06:06.066 --> 06:08.168
Wouldn't have anywhere
for him even if he did.
Ten blade.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.903
Portable chest,
full trauma panel.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.138
NELSON:
Yo, where you going?

06:11.171 --> 06:12.773
You have a collapsed lung,
Nelson.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.775
Dr. Corday is going
to re-inflate it for you,

06:14.808 --> 06:16.744
and we'll keep an eye on you
down here,

06:16.777 --> 06:17.878
so, try not to bleed too much.

06:17.911 --> 06:18.912
Hey, are you
my doctor?

06:18.946 --> 06:20.113
Not at the moment.
Well, when?

06:20.147 --> 06:21.048
I've been waiting
almost an hour!

06:21.081 --> 06:22.850
Have you come to rescue us?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.585
I'm swamped with
these physical
improvements.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.019
You'll have to take
point down here.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.555
Did you fire Romano?
No. Medical leave.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.656
What, his arm?

06:28.689 --> 06:29.857
I can't really
discuss it.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.559
Carter, you know
if CT's back up yet?

06:31.592 --> 06:32.693
I didn't know
it was down.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.861
I thought she had
a benign abdomen.

06:33.894 --> 06:34.895
Well, now she's
unresponsive.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.697
Should have had
a tox screen.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.666
She may be coming
down from speed
or hallucinogens.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.201
She's nuts, right?
Out of it?

06:41.234 --> 06:42.836
So, I don't have
to check out her story?

06:42.870 --> 06:44.071
What, the end of
the world part?

06:44.104 --> 06:45.172
No, the part about men
trying to kill her.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.574
Yeah, I would
look into that.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.141
Hey, I got chronic
pancreatitis.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.877
It's flaring, and I'm
puking my pain pills.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.779
Let me guess;
you need a shot of Demerol.

06:51.812 --> 06:52.880
If you say so.
Just do it fast.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.114
Mastectomy,
radiation, chemo.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.716
Recurred with a
pathologic fracture.

06:55.749 --> 06:56.850
Does she have an oncologist?

06:56.884 --> 06:57.851
The surgeon's
in Japan.

06:57.885 --> 06:58.952
MAN:
I need it now!

06:58.986 --> 07:00.020
GSW en route,

07:00.053 --> 07:01.088
ten minutes out.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.490
All right, come find me.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.191
Hello. I'm Dr. Carter.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.826
Kito Shunko.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.762
And this is
the Venerable Zuin-an.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.598
I'm sorry, Sister Zui...?

07:10.631 --> 07:12.232
Zuin-an.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.869
Are you comfortable with me
doing a physical examination?

07:15.903 --> 07:16.937
( speaking Japanese )

07:16.970 --> 07:19.773
( quivering moan )

07:19.807 --> 07:20.908
Yes.
Okay.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.111
When was her last chemo?

07:24.144 --> 07:25.513
Three months ago,

07:25.546 --> 07:27.648
but it wasn't working
anymore.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.249
I shouldn't have
even brought her here.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.818
But she's
in terrible pain

07:30.851 --> 07:33.120
and hasn't had
anything to drink in two days.

07:33.153 --> 07:36.256
Well, she'll feel much better
with some intravenous fluids,

07:36.289 --> 07:38.526
some antinausea
and pain medication.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.767
( speaking Japanese )

07:50.738 --> 07:52.773
So much sadness.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.042
PRATT:
Whoa.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.710
Somebody overcooked
their burger.

07:56.744 --> 07:57.811
It's arson--
definitely arson.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.747
LEWIS:
Could be electrical.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.015
The place wasn't
exactly a model of
code compliance.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.552
I've been brown-bagging it
since they closed.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.286
And now the cafeteria
has a monopoly.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.120
Was anybody in there?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.656
CFD did a sweep.

08:08.689 --> 08:09.857
Oh, well, I guess
we're closed now.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.091
Oh, we never close.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.292
Yeah, neither
did Doc Magoo's,

08:12.325 --> 08:13.827
and look what happened.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.195
I wouldn't deprive you
of your last shift.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.997
Oh, come on.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.667
Declare internal
disaster so that we
can all go home.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.068
No, you're
an internal disaster.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.636
That's an external
disaster.

08:22.670 --> 08:23.804
( chuckling )

08:23.837 --> 08:25.973
Hey, Abby,
got any marshmallows?

08:27.941 --> 08:30.844
Mr. Mednick, you need
to be on a monitor.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.078
No, what I need
is some fresh air.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.581
And put out
the cigarette.

08:33.581 --> 08:34.682
I'm almost done.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.783
Put out the cigarette!

08:35.816 --> 08:36.917
You have a bleeding ulcer.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.686
I know what I have,
sweetheart.

08:38.719 --> 08:39.753
Okay, that's fine.

08:39.787 --> 08:40.721
Smoke the whole pack.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.022
I'll be inside.

08:42.054 --> 08:44.592
Come and find me
when you start vomiting blood.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.059
Hey, Abby, Doc
Magoo's is on fire.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.294
Yeah, I can
see that.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.764
Single GSW to the...

08:50.798 --> 08:53.133
( explosion )

08:54.968 --> 08:57.905
Now can we go home?

08:57.938 --> 08:59.873
Lizzie. Come to take
the "before" pictures?

08:59.907 --> 09:01.241
Shouldn't you be in pre-op?

09:01.274 --> 09:02.910
Yeah, well,
some man-hating bovine

09:02.943 --> 09:04.612
threw me out here

09:04.612 --> 09:06.614
when an elective lab nissen
started circling the drain.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.848
Hand me that, will you?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.650
What, the chart?
No, the black marker.

09:09.683 --> 09:10.751
Poor bastard came in

09:10.784 --> 09:12.119
trying to cure
aggravated belching.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.087
His wife's probably
down in the coffee shop

09:14.121 --> 09:15.355
waiting for him
to wake up.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.890
Do me a favor?

09:16.924 --> 09:19.126
Write "not this one, idiot"
on my arm.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.694
Oh, like
it doesn't happen.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.229
I'll be lucky
to get out of there

09:22.262 --> 09:24.164
without both my legs
being amputated.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.866
I should have you
come in with me

09:25.899 --> 09:27.768
to stand guard
over these gargoyles.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.937
You can if you want to,
you know--

09:29.970 --> 09:31.304
if you're bored
or curious.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.940
I'm covering the E.R.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.375
Well, they need you
more than I do.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.646
But I'll scrub in if I can.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.949
You forgot "idiot."

09:41.982 --> 09:43.917
I'll be there, Robert.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.886
Yeah, well, just in case
you're not-- "idiot."

09:45.919 --> 09:48.756
( sighing )

09:50.423 --> 09:52.125
You think I'm doing
the right thing?

09:52.159 --> 09:53.761
It doesn't matter what I think.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.862
Well, that's
a position

09:54.895 --> 09:57.397
I would usually advocate, but...

09:57.430 --> 09:59.232
now I'm asking.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.003
You're doing the right thing.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.105
Yeah.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.339
There's something in my eye--

10:06.373 --> 10:07.307
maybe some metal.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.341
Yeah,
don't touch it.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.877
Why, what's it look like?

10:09.910 --> 10:11.178
C.B.C., chem panel,
chest and carboxyhemaglobin.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.280
Satting at 97.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.082
Can someone check
my daughter's ventilator?
It keeps beeping.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.083
I'll send a nurse.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.718
How bad am
I burned?

10:17.751 --> 10:19.352
Mainly second degree,
but the blast threw you.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.353
I want to ultrasound your belly.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.321
Will they do another EEG?

10:21.354 --> 10:22.723
I'll check the chart.

10:22.756 --> 10:23.824
SonoSite and
a Wood's lamp.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.793
Damn tank
blew my mask right off.

10:25.826 --> 10:26.927
You waiting
for somebody?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.662
My-my husband.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.363
You can check
with the clerk at
the front desk.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.264
No, he died.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.733
He had a heart attack.

10:32.766 --> 10:35.936
Oh. You need someone
to take you to him?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.805
No. He was here.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.239
They took him.

10:39.272 --> 10:43.877
We just... wanted
to stay here a minute.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.813
Pratt, Susan needs your help
with a central line.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.681
Hold on;
is there another room open?

10:47.715 --> 10:48.782
Exam One, maybe.

10:48.816 --> 10:49.983
No, it's all right.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.251
We'll leave.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.986
B.P. 122/78,
pulse 114.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.387
TKO the saline.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.789
Come on, Paul.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.891
Dr. Pratt,
my gang kid's hypotensive.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.727
I need the SonoSite
and an extra pair of hands.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.729
WOMAN:
Come on, Paul.

11:01.729 --> 11:02.796
Paul, now.

11:02.830 --> 11:03.964
Can I install
alcaine?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.799
Yeah, titrate
eight of MS.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.434
And keep his systolic over 100.

11:07.467 --> 11:08.736
Is the lung up?

11:08.736 --> 11:10.070
GSW to the
right shoulder.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.905
Good breath sounds
to the apex.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.841
Can you feel it
when I touch you here?

11:13.874 --> 11:15.075
BOY:
I'm good, I told you.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.777
WRIGHT:
Pulse ox 98
on two liters.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.111
Okay, let's get
a pocket Doppler.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.312
C.B.C. type
and screen.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.881
What is that?

11:20.914 --> 11:22.415
GSW to the belly
last week.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.884
We took out
his spleen.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.285
And you're out
running again?

11:25.318 --> 11:26.486
They killed my brother

11:26.519 --> 11:27.988
and crippled my sister.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.389
Here? We took care
of them here?

11:29.422 --> 11:30.958
It didn't help much, huh?

11:30.991 --> 11:32.225
Was Curtis your brother?

11:32.259 --> 11:34.461
What, you were his doctor?

11:34.494 --> 11:36.930
Dr. Carter-- a pediatric
drowning, full arrest.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.431
WRIGHT:
A sinus tach
on the scope. 110.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.868
How are his pulses?

11:40.901 --> 11:42.202
Okay, let's follow
serial crits,

11:42.235 --> 11:43.403
and then come find
me with his films.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.504
12-year-old girl.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.039
Dad was taking her
on a tour boat.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.941
Fell into the water
when he wasn't looking.

11:47.975 --> 11:50.110
You'll have to
relax and let the
doctor do his job.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.178
How long was she in there?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.412
Don't know.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.947
Search and rescue
found her facedown.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.783
Hold compressions.
PEA. Not perfusing.

11:55.783 --> 11:56.917
Compression can put her
into V-fib

11:56.950 --> 11:57.985
if she's too cold.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.052
Let's do a rectal temp.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.220
How long
since the last epi?

12:00.253 --> 12:01.288
Six minutes.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.823
Push another
point five.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.825
Heated, humidified O2,
warm saline, bear hugger.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.259
Core temp is 86.5.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.961
Good enough;
resume compressions.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.129
Still no pulse.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.230
Mig of atropine.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.232
How long
has she been down?

12:12.265 --> 12:13.834
About 45 minutes.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.869
Okay.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.838
Let's go with

12:17.871 --> 12:20.140
NG and bladder irrigation.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.074
When?

12:21.108 --> 12:22.042
Five minutes.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.243
We deep
suctioned her,

12:23.276 --> 12:24.878
and she started
triggering the vent.

12:24.912 --> 12:25.913
I thought she was decerebrate.

12:25.946 --> 12:26.814
She was.

12:26.847 --> 12:27.981
Wean her down
to 50%.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.817
ABG at 15,
check another set of lytes.

12:29.817 --> 12:30.818
Temperature?
97.1.

12:30.818 --> 12:31.985
That's good, right?

12:32.019 --> 12:33.020
What's her name?

12:33.053 --> 12:35.555
Heather.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.057
Heather, can you hear me?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.059
If you can hear me,
squeeze my hand.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.160
I've got a pulse.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.095
It's faint, but it's a pulse.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.496
Let's try for pressure.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.832
Rate's up to 72.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.967
All right,
suction catheter.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.401
Whoa. Pulmonary edema?

12:48.435 --> 12:49.837
Or river water.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.071
Okay, ectopy on the monitor.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.205
Heart's irritable.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.841
Let's set vent
temp to 42.

12:53.841 --> 12:54.908
Four of peep.

12:54.942 --> 12:57.344
Pupils are fixed
and dilated.

12:57.377 --> 13:00.881
Just follow the light
with your eyes. Good.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.049
Very good.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.350
You're doing great, honey.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.584
B.P.'s steady,
110 over 72.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.053
Sats are 93.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.121
I bet you want that tube out,
don't you?

13:08.155 --> 13:10.557
Okay, when I say "now,"
you take a deep breath,

13:10.590 --> 13:12.559
and you blow
as hard as you can, okay?

13:12.592 --> 13:14.027
All right, deep breath.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.863
LOCKHART:
Ready with five
of albuterol.

13:15.896 --> 13:16.897
And now.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.065
Clear.
( coughing )

13:18.098 --> 13:19.432
No change.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.868
All right, 300.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.235
Stand by
with 50 of lidocaine.

13:22.269 --> 13:25.005
Second bolus of 25 in five.
Clear.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.907
HALEH:
Sinus tach.

13:26.940 --> 13:27.908
Strong pulse.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.242
Heather.
Come on, Heather,

13:29.276 --> 13:30.543
wake up,
open your eyes!

13:30.577 --> 13:31.879
She's posturing.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.881
GCS 131.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.317
PRATT:
Non-rebreather mask,
100% high flow.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.886
Daddy.
Yes, honey?

13:38.886 --> 13:40.553
Try not to talk.
Cough all that stuff up.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.891
Another chest,
and repeat the ABG.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.525
Dad?

13:48.361 --> 13:49.930
Mr. Marks?

13:49.963 --> 13:52.365
Yes. Is she going to be okay?

13:52.399 --> 13:54.601
Your daughter was brought in
in cardiac arrest.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.069
She wasn't breathing on her own.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.137
Your daughter's awake.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.105
She's breathing on her own.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.907
She's on a ventilator,

13:59.907 --> 14:01.141
but we don't know how long
she was in the water,

14:01.174 --> 14:02.976
and her lungs
show signs of damage.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.212
Her lungs are recovering,
and she's oxygenating well.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.981
It's possible that her brain
may have been deprived of oxygen

14:08.015 --> 14:08.916
for a long time.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.284
Oh, God.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.086
Oh, my God.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.922
Her neurologic exam
is back to normal.

14:14.922 --> 14:15.989
You saved her.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.590
I-I saw you
save her.

14:17.624 --> 14:20.093
Yeah, we got her
heartbeat back,

14:20.127 --> 14:21.594
but you need to know

14:21.628 --> 14:24.497
that 30% of all near-
drownings die,

14:24.531 --> 14:28.401
and another 30
suffer permanent
brain damage.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.270
We're just going
to have to wait and see.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.539
( quivering exhale )

14:36.944 --> 14:37.677
She's going to be just fine.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.246
Thank you.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.513
( chuckling ):
You're welcome.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.282
All right.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.084
Yeah, go ahead,
go in and see her.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.653
( chuckling )

14:52.425 --> 14:54.027
The just keep getting
younger, don't they?

14:54.061 --> 14:55.662
Is neuro-vascular intact?

14:55.695 --> 14:58.231
Completely, but I'd observe
for an expanding hematoma.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.133
You could at least
take his staples out.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.334
Or we could implant a zipper--

15:01.368 --> 15:02.970
make it easier
for all concerned.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.337
WYATT:
Hello! Still waiting!

15:04.371 --> 15:06.373
Well, you're making
progress, you got a bed.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.340
Yeah, still in pain.

15:07.374 --> 15:08.441
Malik, I need the EEG.

15:08.475 --> 15:09.709
Neurology's backed up.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.011
Who isn't?

15:13.180 --> 15:14.414
( clears throat )

15:14.447 --> 15:16.383
Is she feeling more
comfortable?

15:16.416 --> 15:19.152
Yes, thank you. She's sleeping.

15:19.186 --> 15:22.389
The dehydration
has resolved.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.724
Her vitals
look better.

15:24.757 --> 15:29.062
She says it won't be long.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.198
She might be right.

15:31.231 --> 15:34.267
If there's anybody
who would want to
say good-bye...

15:34.301 --> 15:36.303
They're coming from the temple.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.276
She has a gift.

15:43.310 --> 15:47.014
She can see inside of people.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.049
She saw inside of me.

15:49.082 --> 15:54.287
She was imprisoned for
demonstrating for human rights

15:54.321 --> 15:56.023
in North Korea.

15:56.023 --> 16:01.161
And I was imprisoned for...
well, for other things.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.462
She saved me.

16:02.495 --> 16:07.400
I took it on myself
to serve her purpose,

16:07.434 --> 16:13.440
but now as I watch her embrace
her death and rebirth,

16:13.473 --> 16:16.476
I truly understand:

16:16.509 --> 16:21.348
only through
our own acceptance

16:21.381 --> 16:25.552
do we realize
our purpose.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.524
Is it scabies?

16:31.558 --> 16:34.327
Impetigo. It's
a bacterial
infection.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.763
What if it spreads?
Gets into his brain?

16:36.796 --> 16:38.298
We'll treat it
with antibiotics.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.800
He must have gotten that
from his friends,

16:40.833 --> 16:42.702
because he did not
get that in my house.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.137
Don't touch your face!

16:44.171 --> 16:45.405
I fell.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.507
Is that how you hurt
your wrist, too?

16:47.540 --> 16:49.076
Yeah.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.610
How did you get
to the hospital?

16:51.811 --> 16:53.180
My boyfriend.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.315
Was he there when you fell?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.717
WOMAN:
Ow! Not so hard! Geez.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.686
It's gallstones, Anna.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.255
No. I don't
have gallstones.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.491
Fatty foods bring
out the pain.

17:04.523 --> 17:08.261
I didn't even eat dinner.
I just had some pie.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.362
How much pie?

17:09.396 --> 17:10.530
You know-- a pie.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.698
You a smoker,

17:11.731 --> 17:13.366
Mr. Dressler?
A little.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.435
Drink alcohol?
Yeah.
Beer, mostly.

17:15.468 --> 17:19.239
Exercise?
Well, I was starting
to get back into shape.

17:19.271 --> 17:22.142
I was doing one of my
wife's exercise videos,

17:22.175 --> 17:24.111
and, uh... I feel
a lot better now.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.345
I wasn't sure if it
was the chicken wings

17:25.377 --> 17:26.413
I had last night,
or a heart attack.

17:26.445 --> 17:27.646
Let's hope it
was the wings.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.582
How long is this
going to stay on?

17:29.616 --> 17:31.284
About four
to six weeks.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.320
I have finals in a month.

17:33.353 --> 17:36.723
Well, you can still
study with a cast on.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.792
Not exams. State finals--
cheerleading.

17:39.826 --> 17:44.264
Well, you might
have to give those
pom-poms a rest.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.365
I'll give you compazine
for the nausea.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.433
You can keep the meds down.

17:46.466 --> 17:47.567
No. My doctor tried
that before.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.169
It doesn't work.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.703
Then why does
he prescribe
Percocet?

17:50.737 --> 17:52.405
That's what
I'm asking you.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.873
Demerol works.
150 milligrams.

17:53.906 --> 17:54.774
Whew, big dose!

17:54.807 --> 17:56.409
It's a big pain.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.845
Okay, one shot, one time,
and then that's it.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.547
I'm flagging your chart.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.415
You're going to have to
see a pain specialist.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.451
Good idea.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.753
Haleh, 125 of
Demerol for Mister...

18:06.786 --> 18:08.721
Dean. John Dean.

18:08.755 --> 18:09.889
Haldeman. Bob Haldeman.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.424
I'm serious,
Mr. Haldeman.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.193
One shot of Demerol,
and that's it.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.295
The ER is not a place
to manager chronic pain.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.629
As soon as my
chiropractor

18:16.663 --> 18:18.531
gets back in town,
I'll get adjusted.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.400
Good, 'cause I'm
flagging your chart.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.701
Abby, flag his chart.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.504
Yes, sir. Oh, and
Mr. Johnson made a biscuit.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.174
A "biscuit"?
He took a dump
in a gurney.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.375
Aw, that's beautiful.

18:28.408 --> 18:29.909
Hey, Jerry,
what's the County

18:29.942 --> 18:31.911
to Northwestern
biscuit ratio?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.613
It's got to be
eight to one.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.582
Oh, odds are in
my favor, baby.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.384
Banger number 17's
rolling up.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.819
Excuse me, the nurse
told me to down here...

18:39.852 --> 18:42.455
Yeah, yeah. Sit right there.
We'll get to you.

18:42.489 --> 18:45.392
The old paint factory on Hudson
was probably the worst.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.759
Hot as hell, and the smoke...

18:46.793 --> 18:48.761
Couldn't see your hand
in front of your face.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.797
Isn't the fire
outside, boys?
It's out.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.466
Really? Then shouldn't you be
rolling up your hoses

18:53.500 --> 18:55.202
and heading back
to the station?

18:55.235 --> 18:57.204
Feeding that
little spotted dog?

18:57.237 --> 18:58.505
Polishing your poles?

18:58.538 --> 19:00.473
Are you cranky
or flirting?
What?

19:00.507 --> 19:01.541
"Polish your poles"?

19:01.574 --> 19:02.842
GSW times two
to the left chest.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.344
Pressure's 100 palp,
we scooped and ran.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.878
Shot in the shoulder, too?

19:05.912 --> 19:07.280
No, that's
an old one.
Old one?

19:07.314 --> 19:08.515
Mom... call my Mom.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.217
We will. Let's get
you inside first.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.251
Steri-strips
on the belly.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.419
Oh, God.
He's a baby.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.221
Yeah, that knows
how to take a bullet.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.288
What's your name?
Turner.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.456
Does it hurt here?

19:16.489 --> 19:17.457
( whimpering ):
Yeah. Oh...

19:17.490 --> 19:18.725
How about here?

19:18.758 --> 19:22.362
CARTER:
You want me
to call your mom?

19:23.896 --> 19:26.533
You don't want
to talk to your mom?

19:26.566 --> 19:27.934
She'll kick
my ass.

19:27.967 --> 19:30.470
Well, maybe
that's what you need.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.805
Look, man, she
don't understand.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.307
I don't understand.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.509
Look, they dropped
my brother.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.677
That's all there is.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.912
No, that is not
all there is.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.548
You're what,
13 years old?

19:41.581 --> 19:43.483
There's a lot more
than that.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.584
Not where I live.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.886
You're not one of those guys.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.588
Not yet.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.357
You don't have to be.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.559
Well, somebody's gotta
take care of business.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.761
Your business is your mother
and your sister.

19:54.794 --> 19:55.862
Who's going to take
care of business

19:55.895 --> 19:56.963
when you get killed?

19:56.996 --> 19:58.431
We need the room now!
In a minute.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.267
Cops found a mass suicide
on Folton.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.801
Two more behind us.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.771
C-spine, chest, pelvis, lumbar
spine series, and right tib-fib.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.839
Why did you jump out
a third story window?

20:06.873 --> 20:09.676
I was about to take it, but then
they started forcing me.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.711
Bone culture, gram
of ancef, 100 of gent.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.346
( groaning )
Hang on, Turner.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.781
My feet-- why can't I feel
my feet?

20:14.814 --> 20:15.582
Don't worry, we're
going to take care of that.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.550
Sats are down to 87.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.587
Up him to 15 liters.
We'll need x-ray
for portable chest.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.589
Will somebody please
call my mom?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.391
No problem. Just hold on.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.393
Here...

20:26.426 --> 20:28.795
write down her number.

20:28.828 --> 20:29.829
All right, set her
for narcan and charcoal.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.264
What did they take?

20:31.298 --> 20:33.866
Drank some kind
of poisoned Kool-Aid.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.034
Throwing PVC's.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.469
Okay, stop.
Pull the ambu bag.

20:36.503 --> 20:37.504
What?
Pull it.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.671
On-scene survivor
said

20:38.705 --> 20:40.373
they were meeting
the eclipse.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.674
Oh, Lord.
It's almond smell.
Cyanide.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.543
Gallant, it's cyanide!

20:43.576 --> 20:44.877
We need the antidote kits, now!

20:44.911 --> 20:46.446
Pulse ox is 99.
She's seizing!

20:46.479 --> 20:48.348
It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.582
Her cells can't use the oxygen.

20:49.616 --> 20:50.950
ST elevation
on the monitor.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.852
All right,
four of Ativan.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.554
It's lactic acidosis
of the heart.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.623
We need amyl nitrate perles
down the ET tube and bag.

20:56.656 --> 20:57.824
Sodium nitrate
to follow.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.025
Ten cc's I.V. push
over 4 minutes.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.560
Chest tube on the left,

21:00.593 --> 21:02.061
type and cross for six,
and notify the O.R.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.496
We need the room.

21:03.530 --> 21:04.931
Pupils mid-dilated
and nonreactive.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.999
Okay, move him into the
hall and get the Tonopen.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.468
It's closing in... dark.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.403
And page optho.
I'll be right there.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.438
Stats are down to 84.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.605
Rapid induction,
eight-O tube.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.441
Bad stabbing
victim rolling up.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.775
Pratt.
Abby.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.645
Ten blade. Don't worry,
kid. We got you.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.613
Chart still in
the racks. AMA.

21:20.647 --> 21:21.981
32 French.

21:22.014 --> 21:23.983
Okay, is this your
mom's phone number?

21:24.016 --> 21:25.418
Turner?

21:25.452 --> 21:27.720
Turner?! I need a BP.
He's crashing.

21:27.754 --> 21:28.788
He can't count fingers.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.523
It might be
traumatic glaucoma.

21:30.557 --> 21:34.361
Timoptic and pilocarpine drops
after a gram of Mannitol.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.962
All right, repeat ABG, lytes,

21:35.995 --> 21:38.565
lactate, methemglobin,
and cyanide level.

21:38.598 --> 21:39.899
ST segments are down.

21:39.932 --> 21:41.601
First troponin is
elevated on Dressler.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.002
Who?
Chest pain.
in Exam Four.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.537
Call the O.R.
and tell anesthesia

21:44.571 --> 21:45.772
he made need a Greenfield.

21:45.805 --> 21:46.839
Page cards. Inch
of nitropaste,

21:46.873 --> 21:47.974
aspirin, five
of metroprolol.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.509
You might want
to check for acidosis.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.378
I'm more concerned
about fat embolus.

21:51.378 --> 21:52.845
Spontaneous
eye opening.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.715
Sorry, sir. You'll have
to catch the next eclipse.

21:55.748 --> 21:56.916
Lost the pulse.
Crank it.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.050
1500 in
the Thoraseal.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.552
( groans ):
Suction to me.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.688
No tamponade. Looks like
the pulmonary vein.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.657
( grunts ):
Starting internal
compressions.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.092
Hilum's clamped.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.495

abdominal trauma, no pressure.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.429
Carter-- two more OD's

22:09.462 --> 22:10.763
with one apneic.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.399
Get Weaver down here.
We need more docs.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.033
Aw, man, what happened?

22:14.066 --> 22:15.868
Oh, God.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.036
Found bleeding
with multiple
stab wounds.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.438
Mom's next door.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.539
They were found
hugging each other.

22:19.572 --> 22:20.673
Is she breathing?
Agonal.

22:20.707 --> 22:21.674
All right, pediatric
intubation tray.

22:21.708 --> 22:22.842
Five and a half ET tube...

22:22.875 --> 22:23.876
Pre-op labs and
four units O-Neg,

22:23.910 --> 22:25.745
and get surgery
down here.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.647
Strong pulse.
They must not've
given her enough.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.616
Must be a couple
of units on the
clothes alone.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.618
There was blood
all over the scene.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.553
Starting compression,
ragged incision.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.422
What'd they use?
A meat cleaver?

22:35.422 --> 22:37.857
Pratt, she's open
all the way down
to the bladder.

22:37.890 --> 22:38.925
Oh, God, who would
do this to their kid?

22:38.958 --> 22:40.727
There were
ten kids.

22:40.760 --> 22:41.961
This is the only
one we found that
had a chance.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.496
That looks like a
pregnant uterus.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.664
Where's
the baby?
What baby?

22:44.697 --> 22:45.832
Oh, God.
What?

22:45.865 --> 22:46.899
Somebody ripped
it out of her.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.468
Okay, I'm in.
Take over.

22:48.501 --> 22:49.936
Call RT, have
them send down
a pediatric vent.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.638
Hemocue's 5.1.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.573
Retinal arteries
and veins are
bright red.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.708
O-Neg wide open.
Feels open to
the spine.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.577
Consistent
with cyanide.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.912
Like a C-Section.
Check ephemerol
with compressions.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.881
Pharmacy only
had one more
cyanide kit.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.450
What?
Dammit.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.484
Hospital only
stocks three
of them.

23:04.517 --> 23:05.485
Lap and pressure.

23:05.518 --> 23:06.919
All right,
we need more kits.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.555
You need to
deliver the
uterus.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.590
Call Mercy, call
Lakeside, call...
Yeah. Right.

23:10.623 --> 23:11.724
Will they get
here in time?

23:11.758 --> 23:12.759
If packing
doesn't work,

23:12.792 --> 23:13.660
just clamp
it off.

23:13.693 --> 23:14.827
Bradying
down.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.496
Okay, okay,
side-biting
clamp.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.931
Give whatever we
got to the daughter.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.500
Mom's pressure's
going down to 80.

23:20.533 --> 23:21.901
Nitrate popper
for each,

23:21.934 --> 23:24.471
then the daughter gets
30 cc's of sodium nitrate.

23:24.471 --> 23:25.605
Maybe the girl
can wait.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.507
Give the mother
whatever we got left.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.841
That's a
Fallopian
tube.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.209
That's an
ineffective
dose.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.044
Uterine artery runs
at the inferior
margin?

23:32.078 --> 23:33.546
She needs
10 cc's.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.582
Right?
Yeah.
Clamp it, now!

23:35.615 --> 23:36.649
Carter...
I know!

23:36.683 --> 23:37.584
I got it...

23:37.617 --> 23:38.718
I think I got it.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.821
All right.
Stop compressions.

23:44.591 --> 23:48.094
I have a little pulse.
Okay.

23:48.127 --> 23:49.829
Okay, trauma kit,
open a cut-down tray,

23:49.862 --> 23:53.566
keep jamming with O-Neg,
and hope she wakes up.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.234
Keep her hemoglobin
level under 40%.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.569
And come back
with her films.

23:56.603 --> 23:57.504
Thiosulfate's
on board.

23:57.537 --> 23:58.871
Call of six
on the mom!

23:58.905 --> 24:00.239
100 of lidocaine.
Did you get another kit?

24:00.272 --> 24:01.674
20 minutes out.

24:01.708 --> 24:02.675
All right, crank
the last amyl nitrate!

24:02.709 --> 24:03.242
Carter!
Hey.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.644
Soft restraints?

24:04.677 --> 24:07.213
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Purposeful movements.

24:07.246 --> 24:08.815
We're getting some brain
function back.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.518
Hey. Hi, Sweetie...

24:11.518 --> 24:12.585
TURNER:
How's that, huh?!

24:12.619 --> 24:13.686
How's that?!
How's that?!

24:13.720 --> 24:14.754
( screaming )

24:14.787 --> 24:16.656
Turner? Somebody get security!

24:16.689 --> 24:17.857
Clear.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.526
Come on, Turner.
Still in fib.

24:19.559 --> 24:20.693
How many units are in?

24:20.727 --> 24:22.729
Six of packed cells,
one of FFP.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.631
Clear.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.533
( yelling )
Turner!

24:26.533 --> 24:28.568
How's that?!
How's that?!

24:28.601 --> 24:30.703
Drop it!
Drop the scalpel!

24:30.737 --> 24:32.639
How's that?!
Drop it!

24:35.675 --> 24:38.077
Chest tube and intubation tray!

24:39.746 --> 24:41.548
No, wait, Turner--
you're bleeding.

24:43.115 --> 24:44.083
Security!

24:46.586 --> 24:48.254
( equipment clattering )

24:48.287 --> 24:49.656
Good pulse with
compressions.

24:49.689 --> 24:50.790
Epi's had time
to circulate.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.058
Heart's filling well.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.826
Checking the monitor.
Start a second

24:53.860 --> 24:54.994
line of saline,
wide open,

24:55.027 --> 24:56.028
and prep the left chest.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.063
Turner!

24:57.096 --> 25:00.933
( monitor flat-lining )

25:00.967 --> 25:03.570
( sighs )

25:06.272 --> 25:09.842
PRATT:
Time of death, 00:28.

25:12.912 --> 25:14.146
KLINE:
You didn't
call him back?

25:14.180 --> 25:15.582
BJERKE:
I'm sure,
after four weeks?

25:15.615 --> 25:16.816
You don't know that.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.250
Maybe his grandfather died,
or something.

25:18.284 --> 25:19.752
There are phones
in funeral homes.

25:19.786 --> 25:20.953
Can get you a
little Valium

25:20.987 --> 25:22.955
to take the edge off.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.223
Dr. Romano?

25:24.256 --> 25:25.592
What?

25:25.625 --> 25:26.192
Would you like some Valium?

25:26.225 --> 25:27.159
Help you relax.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.861
I don't want to relax.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.863
So you're not going
to call him back?
No way.

25:30.897 --> 25:32.965
I thought you were crazy
about him.
I am.

25:32.999 --> 25:35.234
Make sure I have
some number eight Biogels.

25:35.267 --> 25:36.769
How are we doing, Dr. Romano?

25:36.803 --> 25:39.305
Never better.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.307
SHIRLEY:
Can you scootch
over for us?

25:41.340 --> 25:43.209
KLINE:
Tank him up with a liter.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.711
Who's that scrubbing in?

25:44.744 --> 25:46.145
Uh, Dr. Starkman,
third year.

25:46.178 --> 25:47.780
No. No way.
No residents.

25:47.814 --> 25:49.181
Geez, was this table
in a freezer?

25:49.215 --> 25:50.950
I know.
It can get a little cold.

25:50.983 --> 25:54.020
KLINE:
I'll be doing the
procedure, Robert.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.287
Once you're out,
we'll make

25:55.321 --> 25:56.956
a circumferential
cut around the...

25:56.989 --> 25:58.124
Yeah, I know the routine.

25:58.157 --> 25:59.358
Let's just get on with it.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.293
Okay.
Set up a pre-op Doppler,

26:01.327 --> 26:02.895
sterile Stryker set.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.831
Where's Corday?
I thought she was scrubbing in.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.032
KLINE:
What for?

26:06.065 --> 26:07.299
She was with
an E.R. patient.

26:07.333 --> 26:08.968
You want me
to page her?
No. No.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.970
KLINE:
All right, mix up
a gram of Ancef.

26:11.003 --> 26:13.806
Uh, you may want to put that
on the other hand.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.875
Oh... sorry.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.945
BJERKE:
Count backwards from
ten, Dr. Romano.

26:18.978 --> 26:21.914
Ten...

26:21.948 --> 26:24.316
nine...

26:24.350 --> 26:26.653
( weakly ):
eight...

26:26.686 --> 26:27.954
PRATT:
Hold still.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.389
MARQUEZ:
Tonopen's twenty?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.258
Two drops of iodipine
and pred forte.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.760
I'm losing my sight?

26:33.793 --> 26:34.927
Maybe partly?

26:34.961 --> 26:36.829
Between the burn
and traumatic glaucoma

26:36.863 --> 26:37.964
but only in the one eye.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.098
What's her pressure?

26:39.131 --> 26:40.099
90/60.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.901
And she's waking up.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.002
You need depth
perception

26:43.035 --> 26:44.003
to be a firefighter.

26:44.036 --> 26:44.837
We're not even sure yet.

26:44.871 --> 26:46.338
Where's O.B.?

26:46.372 --> 26:48.808
Coburn came down,
took a quick look
and went to scrub.

26:48.841 --> 26:50.777
Mia, you were stabbed.

26:50.810 --> 26:54.046
We stabilized you but in order
for us to save your uterus

26:54.080 --> 26:56.082
you're going to have
to go into surgery.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.250
ABBY:
Last crit was 19.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.919
Pratt?

27:01.253 --> 27:02.989
Pratt?

27:07.794 --> 27:09.929
We don't know.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.098
CARTER:
Can you tell me

27:12.131 --> 27:14.300
on a scale of one to ten
how bad the pain is?

27:14.333 --> 27:15.802
How high? Eight.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.036
No, it's nine.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.938
Sorry to tell you this,
Mr. Dressler,

27:18.971 --> 27:20.973
but it looks like you're having
a heart attack.

27:21.007 --> 27:22.341
Oh, God.
We need to take you
upstairs

27:22.374 --> 27:24.276
and unblock the vessel
with a balloon catheter.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.311
HALEH:
Dr. Carter?

27:25.344 --> 27:27.179
Your dad's
on line three.

27:27.213 --> 27:28.347
Okay, thank you.

27:28.380 --> 27:29.882
Do you want us
to call your wife?

27:29.916 --> 27:31.217
No, my wife took the
kids to Lincoln Park

27:31.250 --> 27:33.085
to watch the eclipse.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.987
( grunting ):
I left a message
for her at home.

27:35.021 --> 27:36.188
Okay, not to worry.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.824
They're going
to take you right up.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.892
Integrelin bolus
then 15 migs per hour.

27:39.926 --> 27:40.993
Where's that girl's EEG?

27:41.027 --> 27:42.161
Tech took it up.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.930
Well, then get neurology on it!

27:46.032 --> 27:46.966
Hello.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.400
Hey, Dad.

27:48.434 --> 27:51.738
How are you?
Where are you?

27:51.738 --> 27:53.105
John,
what the hell happened?

27:53.139 --> 27:55.241
Sorry, what?
Where did he get hold
of a scalpel?

27:55.274 --> 27:57.076
Too many patients,
not enough staff

27:57.109 --> 27:58.244
and not enough medicine.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.812
Which is why you prioritize

27:59.846 --> 28:00.847
based on severity
of illness.
Oh, no.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.749
Really?

28:02.782 --> 28:04.250
Well, can't we
just postpone for
a couple of days?

28:04.283 --> 28:05.852
Hey...
I'll just stay
in Chicago.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.153
This woman has
a fatal arrhythmia...

28:07.186 --> 28:09.188
I'm on the phone, Kerry!

28:10.189 --> 28:11.390
I'm sorry.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.293
No, it's just
one of those...

28:14.326 --> 28:15.828
Okay.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.764
Yeah, we can
reschedule.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.065
( hangs up phone )

28:19.098 --> 28:20.867
Fatal arrhythmia.

28:20.900 --> 28:24.003
That's what happens when
you chug too much cyanide.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.972
And are undertreated.

28:26.005 --> 28:27.840
The daughter
was less critical.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.075
And could've died.

28:29.108 --> 28:31.310
The girl didn't
have a choice.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.480
Waiting room rack
is over 30.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.315
I'll take lead
for the rest of the shift.

28:36.348 --> 28:37.483
Good.

28:37.516 --> 28:38.918
Hey, you're bleeding.

28:38.951 --> 28:41.353
What?

28:41.387 --> 28:42.989
Your back.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.827
Hey, Malik, can you draw up
HIV-hepatitis serologies

28:47.860 --> 28:48.995
on the stabbed gangbanger.

28:49.028 --> 28:50.162
Already to him
down to morgue.

28:50.196 --> 28:51.964
Have pathology do it.

28:51.998 --> 28:54.466
Oh, yeah, Cath Lab
said they can take
this guy in 30.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.501
No, now.

28:55.534 --> 28:56.869
He's losing heart muscle.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.337
Push half a dose of TNK.

28:58.370 --> 29:01.473
It's just going to be
one more minute, Mr. Dressler.

29:01.507 --> 29:04.877
Doc... I've got a really
bad feeling here.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.012
Ah, don't worry.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.413
We're going
to take care of you.

29:07.446 --> 29:08.848
No, no.
Do me a favor.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.316
I need a... piece
of paper and a pen.

29:10.349 --> 29:12.284
I want to write
a note to my kids

29:12.318 --> 29:14.053
just in case I, uh...

29:14.086 --> 29:16.088
I mean, you know, in case
they get here and I'm...

29:16.122 --> 29:17.156
Yeah, absolutely.

29:17.189 --> 29:18.457
But we have
a really good chance

29:18.490 --> 29:19.859
of reversing...

29:19.892 --> 29:20.893
Dr. Carter,
we need you!

29:21.994 --> 29:23.162
Is he under?

29:23.195 --> 29:24.864
KLINE:
Well, I hope so.

29:24.897 --> 29:27.099
I'm disarticulating
at the elbow.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.467
Way up there on the bovie.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.102
He was asking for you.

29:30.136 --> 29:33.072
I was detained with
an unstable pulseless tib-fib.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.340
Well,
you're here now.

29:34.373 --> 29:35.507
Two large bore IVs.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.009
Trauma labs, four of O-neg.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.510
Kerry, what
are you doing?

29:38.544 --> 29:40.112
Ten-foot fall
from scaffolding.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.547
Rebar through
the right chest.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.082
Well, C-collar,
backboard and
a gurney.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.851
Let's get him
into... Trauma.

29:44.884 --> 29:46.418
No, can't. Rebar's stuck
in a concrete block.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.087
Must be 500 pounds.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.521
MAN:
Can't we just pull
him off there?

29:49.555 --> 29:51.023
No, he'll bleed to death.

29:51.057 --> 29:52.892
Rebar's compressing
the torn vessels.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.026
All right,
call the fire department.

29:54.060 --> 29:55.461
Have them bring
extrication gear.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.296
Go inside, get
a portable monitor
and an E cylinder.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.230
WRIGHT:
Up there?

29:58.264 --> 29:59.598
Yeah, and get a hemocue.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.100
( strained ):
You can't take it out?

30:01.133 --> 30:02.835
We'll do that in
the operating room.

30:02.869 --> 30:05.004
Do you feel any numbness
or weakness in your legs?

30:05.037 --> 30:06.038
No, not really?

30:06.072 --> 30:07.173
Decreased
on the right

30:07.206 --> 30:09.541
but no JVD
or tracheal shift.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.043
Look.

30:11.077 --> 30:12.244
What?

30:12.278 --> 30:14.413
JERRY:
Dr. Pratt.

30:14.446 --> 30:15.948
Some guy wants to talk
to the doctor

30:15.982 --> 30:17.216
who treated
that pregnant stab victim.

30:17.249 --> 30:18.184
Take a message.

30:18.217 --> 30:19.118
Are you okay? Sir?

30:19.151 --> 30:20.219
Huh? Oh.

30:20.252 --> 30:21.921
Just get
a little winded sometimes.

30:21.954 --> 30:27.259
You ought to get
that thing fixed.

30:27.293 --> 30:28.360
What's your name?

30:28.394 --> 30:29.528
Ray.
Ray Jamison.

30:29.561 --> 30:31.463
Mr. Jamison,
you have any chest pain?

30:31.497 --> 30:34.066
More like palpitations.
Comes and goes.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.002
I've been to
a couple clinics,

30:36.035 --> 30:38.137
but they keep saying
nothing's wrong.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.872
You don't have a doctor?

30:39.906 --> 30:41.640
Medicare kicks
in next year.

30:41.673 --> 30:42.474
Ever have an EKG?

30:42.508 --> 30:44.143
Normal, they said.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.112
But my ticker was on good
behavior at the time.

30:46.145 --> 30:47.346
JERRY:
Dr. Pratt,
I really think

30:47.379 --> 30:48.614
you should take this.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.149
He knows something
about the assault.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.383
And don't eat those.
I can get you something

30:51.417 --> 30:52.484
that at least looks
like food.

30:52.518 --> 30:53.585
You don't need
to do that.

30:53.619 --> 30:55.587
No, I'm your doctor now.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.089
Thanks.

30:57.123 --> 30:59.358
This is Dr. Pratt.

30:59.391 --> 31:02.228
Yeah, who's this?

31:02.261 --> 31:06.065
Yeah, she's alive, why?

31:06.098 --> 31:08.034
What?

31:13.139 --> 31:14.240
CARTER:
Hemocue is 9.4.

31:14.273 --> 31:15.674
WEAVER:
Titrate four of MS.

31:15.707 --> 31:16.943
Where's the O-neg?!

31:16.943 --> 31:17.676
Right here.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.178
Do we need an airbag?

31:19.211 --> 31:20.346
Pretty tight.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.513
How much can we raise him?

31:21.547 --> 31:22.481
Oh, maybe an inch
or two.

31:22.514 --> 31:23.515
What's his pressure?

31:23.549 --> 31:24.516
It's up to
a hundred.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.985
GALLANT:
Dr. Carter.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.686
Exam Two's drowning
in pulmonary edema.

31:27.719 --> 31:28.687
Who?

31:28.720 --> 31:29.956
The Buddhist nun.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.223
I got it.
Go.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.524
In the alley?

31:32.558 --> 31:33.692
The north side.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.361
Why didn't he just
bring it in?

31:35.394 --> 31:36.562
'Cause he freaked out.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.130
His wife came home with a baby

31:38.164 --> 31:40.532
and said she gave birth
while he was at work.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.568
He saw the news and
put it together. Here.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.403
PRATT:
Grab a BOA kit.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.705
ABBY:
Susan, set up
for a neonatal resuscitation.

31:46.738 --> 31:47.974
Where?

31:47.974 --> 31:49.575
Is that for pain?

31:49.608 --> 31:51.443
She's in pain again.

31:51.477 --> 31:53.612
No, this is for the fluid
in her lungs.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.214
I can give her morphine,

31:55.247 --> 31:58.050
but it will suppress
her breathing even more.

32:08.327 --> 32:11.430
( chanting )

32:23.609 --> 32:25.244
( Pratt groans )

32:25.277 --> 32:26.545
Where?

32:26.578 --> 32:28.347
I don't know.
He just said in the alley.

32:28.380 --> 32:29.715
( gasping )

32:29.748 --> 32:31.483
No breath sound
on the right.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.652
WEAVER:
It's a massive hemothorax.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.287
He needs a chest tube tray.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.188
Inflate.

32:36.222 --> 32:37.656
( man cries out )

32:37.689 --> 32:40.026

I'll retract the supinator,

Four of morphine on board.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.413
( monks chanting softly )

33:01.447 --> 33:04.050
I better check BP.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.252
No.

33:06.285 --> 33:09.088
No more BPs.

33:10.089 --> 33:12.258
Find anything?

33:12.291 --> 33:13.492
No.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.227
Are you sure this
wasn't a prank?

33:15.261 --> 33:17.629
Wait, wait, shh!
Listen.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.567
There must be three
liters in there.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.669
Grab a sterile base,
and the biggest one we got.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.604
Tachy at 140,
barely has a pulse.

33:25.637 --> 33:26.772
Hang another two.

33:26.805 --> 33:27.706
Doc, get rid of the O2.

33:27.739 --> 33:28.607
Make it fast.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.641
Clamping the tube.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.177

Go!

No.

Why didn't he put him

33:59.171 --> 34:00.506
where we could see him?

34:00.539 --> 34:02.408
He didn't want it
to get run over.

34:02.441 --> 34:03.475
Find him?

34:03.509 --> 34:04.343
No.

34:04.376 --> 34:05.644
( saw buzzing )

34:05.677 --> 34:08.280
Slide the backboard up here.
Hurry up.

34:08.313 --> 34:09.815
CHEN:
Pulse ox is down to 83.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.417
Get ready to put
the O2 back on.

34:11.449 --> 34:12.650
He's free.
( sawing stops )

34:12.684 --> 34:13.851
Roll him!

34:16.121 --> 34:17.389
Arm's free.

34:17.422 --> 34:18.623
Rasp back.

34:18.657 --> 34:19.725
Don't want a bone spur.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.726
Take a little more periosteum.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.695
3-0 vicryl.

Hey, over here!

35:07.439 --> 35:08.774
( softly ):
Hey.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.742
There we go.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.444
I got ya.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.846
Hey there, little guy.

35:14.880 --> 35:18.184
( Lewis chuckling )

35:20.652 --> 35:21.887
Can you hear me? Hello?

35:21.920 --> 35:22.821
Yeah, barely.

35:22.854 --> 35:24.323
What's going on?

35:24.356 --> 35:25.891
One of our doctors
was hurt yesterday,

35:25.924 --> 35:27.626
had to be evacuated
to Burundi.

35:27.659 --> 35:28.660
Hurt? How?

35:28.694 --> 35:30.296
We're expecting a fourth,

35:30.329 --> 35:32.531
but they're having
trouble with her visa.

35:32.564 --> 35:33.499
Luka, you got to speak up.

35:33.532 --> 35:34.800
Can your contact

35:34.833 --> 35:37.603
at the State Department
push her visa through?

35:37.636 --> 35:38.770
What contact?

35:38.804 --> 35:40.606
I thought
you knew someone there.

35:40.639 --> 35:43.842
My family had a friend that was
ambassador to Uruguay, but...

35:43.875 --> 35:44.743
Call him.

35:44.776 --> 35:45.944
I don't know him.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.846
Can't the Alliance fix it?

35:47.879 --> 35:50.949
( woman speaking French )

35:50.982 --> 35:52.418
Not enough.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.686
( speaking French )

35:57.789 --> 35:58.690
Okay, I'll be right there.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.226
What?

36:00.259 --> 36:01.393
We're trying
to travel to Matenda,

36:01.427 --> 36:03.229
but the main road is blocked.

36:03.229 --> 36:06.398
There's a cholera epidemic
in the refugee population

36:06.432 --> 36:09.935
and we can't even get them
rehydration solution.

36:09.968 --> 36:12.504
You want someone to come
and pitch in for a couple weeks?

36:12.538 --> 36:13.805
What?

36:13.839 --> 36:16.708
I've already had my shots,
my visa.

36:16.742 --> 36:19.478
I thought you changed your mind.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.781
Yeah, but, you know,
if you're stretched.

36:22.814 --> 36:26.752
( speaking French )

36:26.785 --> 36:27.753
Okay, I got to go.

36:27.786 --> 36:28.787
Can you come now?

36:28.820 --> 36:30.756
Yeah, okay.

36:30.789 --> 36:31.757
Get on a plane.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.725
Charge to 360.
Hello?

36:33.759 --> 36:34.826
When did he
arrest?
Now.

36:34.860 --> 36:35.861
Clear.

36:35.894 --> 36:36.762
Is that my MI?

36:36.795 --> 36:37.929
Dressler.
V-fib.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.531
MALIK:
Bigeminy flipped
into V-tach

36:39.565 --> 36:40.532
when we started rolling.

36:40.566 --> 36:41.633
We never made
the elevator.

36:41.667 --> 36:42.634
How many times
was he shocked?

36:42.668 --> 36:43.669
Third one
coming up.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.271
Amp of epi, I'll intubate.

36:45.271 --> 36:46.905
What the hell's
he still doing down here?

36:46.938 --> 36:48.307
I told you Cath Lab
said 30 minutes.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.408
Clear!

36:49.441 --> 36:52.010
All right, prep 100
of lidocaine.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.012
LOCKHART:
He's a little tachy
at 165.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.714
Slight flow murmur.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.284
Fontanelle's soft,
but sunken.

36:58.284 --> 36:59.585
He's definitely dry.

36:59.618 --> 37:00.552
He's full term.

37:00.586 --> 37:01.987
Mom's in post-op.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.022
Hemodynamically stable,
and they saved her uterus.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.023
How is he?

37:05.056 --> 37:06.292
Heel stick
a glucose,

37:06.325 --> 37:07.326
but I think we have

37:07.359 --> 37:08.427
a healthy baby.

37:08.460 --> 37:09.428
He's a screamer.

37:09.461 --> 37:10.329
Wouldn't you be?

37:10.362 --> 37:11.630
Literally ripped from

37:11.663 --> 37:12.998
your mother's womb
by some lunatic.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.866
Hell of a way
to come into the world.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.768
Yeah, but life
only gets better after that.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.505
I'll bolus
20 per kilo

37:19.538 --> 37:20.572
I'll do it.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.874
What?

37:22.908 --> 37:24.843
If accu-check
is less than 50,

37:24.876 --> 37:26.378
then I need to push D-25.

37:26.412 --> 37:29.581
Whatever you say,
doctor.

37:29.615 --> 37:30.582
Asystole.

37:30.616 --> 37:31.650
Give me the pacing pads.

37:31.683 --> 37:32.984
Let's push
three more of epi.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.386
GALLANT:
Resume CPR.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.322
Family's here.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.690
The, uh, the letter.

37:38.724 --> 37:39.991
What?

37:40.025 --> 37:41.427
The pen and paper.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.862
Did you give him
a pen and paper?

37:43.895 --> 37:44.696
No.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.332
Why not?

37:46.365 --> 37:47.466
What?

37:47.499 --> 37:48.700
He asked for a pen
and some paper

37:48.734 --> 37:49.835
to write a letter to his kids.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.371
He didn't
ask me.

37:53.805 --> 37:54.840
There it is.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.942
It's just a sub-Q bleeder.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.477
Clamp that off.

37:58.510 --> 37:59.745
You want cautery?

37:59.778 --> 38:02.781
No, I'll use the silver
nitrate sticks.

38:02.814 --> 38:06.352
Don't contaminate the field.

38:06.352 --> 38:08.687
Robert?

38:08.720 --> 38:11.557
Bovie that bleeder.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.825
Pick-ups.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.994
Robert,
it's Elizabeth.

38:16.027 --> 38:20.766
Lizzie...

38:20.799 --> 38:24.536
She's one hell of a surgeon.

38:24.570 --> 38:26.672
So beautiful.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.674
Done.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.776
That was just
a small EBL,

38:30.809 --> 38:33.645
but we can order
a post-op CBC

38:33.679 --> 38:34.880
just to be safe.

38:34.913 --> 38:38.884
You're taking good
care of me.

38:38.917 --> 38:41.787
I'm trying, yes.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.790
I love you, Elizabeth.

38:47.393 --> 38:49.861
You need to get
some rest.

38:49.895 --> 38:52.063
Let's put a fresh
pressure dressing on

38:52.097 --> 38:54.700
and I'll check it later.

38:59.505 --> 39:02.774
PRATT:
Hey, you have
a visitor.

39:02.808 --> 39:04.776
Is that...?

39:04.810 --> 39:06.878
It's your baby.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.013
You had a boy.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.681
Is he okay?

39:09.715 --> 39:10.916
He's great.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.083
Active.

39:12.117 --> 39:13.852
Likes to play hide-and-seek.

39:13.885 --> 39:16.622
My baby.

39:16.655 --> 39:19.090
You want to hold him?

39:19.124 --> 39:20.626
Yeah.

39:20.659 --> 39:22.694
Come on, little guy.

39:22.728 --> 39:25.531
I got you, I got you.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.077
Still asystole.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.879
He's had two of atropine?

39:40.912 --> 39:42.714
Oh, yeah.

39:42.748 --> 39:45.951
All right, increase the pulse
duration to 20 milliseconds.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.786
Dr. Carter.

39:47.819 --> 39:50.456
How long we been going?

39:50.489 --> 39:52.458
62 minutes.

39:53.925 --> 39:56.462
All right, stop.

39:56.495 --> 39:59.865
You can stop.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.687
Mrs. Dressler, I'm Dr. Carter.

40:25.123 --> 40:27.859
Your husband
came in with chest pain.

40:27.893 --> 40:30.028
He was having
a heart attack.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.797
He's dead?

40:33.932 --> 40:36.602
We were just about
to move him up to the cath lab

40:36.635 --> 40:39.838
to unblock the main artery when
he went into cardiac arrest.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.546
And I couldn't get him back.

40:48.914 --> 40:50.716
Did he know?

40:52.551 --> 40:54.586
Did he know what
was happening?

40:56.988 --> 41:00.458
Yeah, he wanted me...

41:02.894 --> 41:05.731
to, um, tell you that he loved--

41:05.764 --> 41:10.035
loves you all very much.

41:15.541 --> 41:17.175
Hypertensive encephalopathy
on nipride.

41:17.208 --> 41:18.910
Let me guess.
No ICU beds.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.245
The gang war continues.

41:20.278 --> 41:21.880
Dyspareunia waiting on

41:21.913 --> 41:23.281
gram stain and wet mount.

41:23.314 --> 41:25.617
Dyspareunia's better
than no pareunia.

41:25.651 --> 41:26.852
And we have Mr. Jamison here,

41:26.885 --> 41:28.119
who's back in normal sinus

41:28.153 --> 41:30.255
after yours truly
picked up atrial flutter.

41:30.288 --> 41:32.290
I though heart monitors
did that.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.892
No more Chihuahua?

41:33.925 --> 41:35.627
It's a miracle,
what did you do?

41:35.661 --> 41:37.696
I just flipped
the circuit breaker back on.

41:37.729 --> 41:38.997
But now that we know what it is,

41:39.030 --> 41:40.832
you can be treated
with a simple prescription.

41:40.866 --> 41:42.133
I come see you
at your office?

41:42.167 --> 41:43.902
This is my office.

41:43.935 --> 41:45.671
Or was.

41:45.704 --> 41:46.672
What?

41:46.705 --> 41:48.840
I just work in the hospital.

41:48.874 --> 41:49.975
Well that's
too bad.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.977
You're a fine doctor.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.245
Thank you.

41:54.279 --> 41:56.715
See you, sweetness.

41:59.685 --> 42:01.019
Call you later.

42:01.052 --> 42:03.589
Congratulations,
Greg.

42:03.622 --> 42:05.991
You survived
the County experience.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.993
Oh, no, not just survived it.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.595
I whooped its ass.

42:14.165 --> 42:15.200
Hey.

42:15.233 --> 42:16.267
Hey.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.840
Did you see the eclipse?

42:21.873 --> 42:23.775
Yeah.

42:23.809 --> 42:25.010
Sort of.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.613
Pretty freaky, huh?

42:27.613 --> 42:30.982
Yeah, I guess.

42:32.851 --> 42:33.985
You have a rough shift?

42:34.019 --> 42:37.889
Yeah, there
was this guy, this MI.

42:37.923 --> 42:40.826
Asked me for a pen
and some paper

42:40.859 --> 42:43.328
to write a note
to his kids and...

42:43.361 --> 42:46.832
Couldn't save him,
but I could have...

42:50.201 --> 42:51.637
What?

42:51.637 --> 42:54.305
Nothing.

42:57.042 --> 42:59.210
Nothing's right here.

43:02.347 --> 43:03.381
Hey.

43:03.414 --> 43:06.017
I haven't seen you
in a week.

43:06.051 --> 43:07.719
That's it?

43:12.991 --> 43:14.660
Luka called me...

43:14.660 --> 43:17.729
looking for you.

43:17.763 --> 43:20.331
He was under the impression
I might know where you were.

43:23.702 --> 43:26.004
You're going, right?

43:26.037 --> 43:28.073
To Africa.

43:34.946 --> 43:39.017
It's not Rio, but it's not here.

44:49.955 --> 44:52.824
WEAVER:
Are you supposed
to be in there?

44:52.858 --> 44:55.360
It's a First Aid kit.

44:55.393 --> 44:57.963
Damn near the only
thing that survived.

44:57.996 --> 44:59.097
How was your last shift?

44:59.130 --> 45:00.832
Lots of excitement.

45:00.866 --> 45:05.070
Well, if you're ever bored,
God knows we need the staff.

45:05.103 --> 45:06.237
Yeah.

45:06.271 --> 45:07.839
HALEH:
Dr. Pratt!

45:07.873 --> 45:10.141
You forgot to give Jamison
his "didge" prescription.

45:10.175 --> 45:11.142
Jing-Mei can do it.

45:11.176 --> 45:13.311
.25 or .125?

45:13.344 --> 45:15.013
No, lower dose.

45:15.046 --> 45:18.083
Next available appointment
at the cardiology clinic

45:18.116 --> 45:19.951
is in four months,
that's okay?

45:19.985 --> 45:21.787
( sighs )

45:25.223 --> 45:26.992
Just let me write it.

45:27.025 --> 45:29.394
After care instructions, too.

45:29.427 --> 45:32.063
Return to the ER in a week
for a "didge" level.

45:32.097 --> 45:35.000
Tell him to call Dr. Pratt,
make sure I'm on duty first.

45:35.033 --> 45:37.035
I thought you were going
to Northwestern.

45:37.068 --> 45:39.370
Ah, guess I'm more
of a Southside doc.

45:39.404 --> 45:40.138
You staying here?

45:40.171 --> 45:41.272
What the hell.

45:41.306 --> 45:44.309
This place kind
of grows on you.
