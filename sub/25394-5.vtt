00:01.653 --> 00:03.525
Previously onSalvation...Are you or are you not

00:03.568 --> 00:06.658
a member of RE/SYST?Yes, I am.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.312
That woman is dangerous.

00:08.356 --> 00:09.400
LIAM: She seems to want
to solve the asteroid problem,

00:09.444 --> 00:10.836
just like us.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.274
DARIUS: Alycia Vrettou is
nothing like us.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.145
You got in one fight with
Darius, and you're going back

00:15.189 --> 00:18.105
to RE/SYST. Good-bye, Liam,
and good luck.

00:18.148 --> 00:20.629
My removal from office
was criminal!

00:22.326 --> 00:24.372
Chief Justice Cheng remains
in critical condition.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.809
Cheng's vote is the deciding
factor as to who is

00:26.852 --> 00:28.680
the rightful President
of the United States.

00:28.724 --> 00:31.727
Get his sworn statement
before it's too late.I'll go.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.163
DARIUS: You're intentionally putting yourself in harm's way.

00:33.207 --> 00:34.164
Now what are
you doing?

00:34.208 --> 00:36.166
Giving you the shirt
off my back.

00:36.210 --> 00:36.993
Bulletproof.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.734
GRACE:
Can I help you?

00:38.777 --> 00:39.648
I'm investigating
the disappearance

00:39.691 --> 00:42.172
of Claire Rayburn.

00:42.216 --> 00:44.522
Claire's my sister.
Someone killed her.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.959
Detective, I can't
help you right now. I'm sorry.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.613
Bennett's put out
a call to arms.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.224
His civilian militia's
gonna ambush the hospital.

00:50.267 --> 00:51.529
You need to get out of there.

00:51.573 --> 00:53.618
I'm not leaving here
without his decision.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.577
The rightful president is...

00:56.447 --> 00:57.753
We got to get out of here.

00:57.796 --> 00:59.102
I've got it, I
just can't send it.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.364
Grace, we have to shut down
the Internet

01:00.408 --> 01:02.062
to choke off
Bennett's communications.

01:02.105 --> 01:03.541
There's a heliport, we're gonna
get you out of there.

01:04.455 --> 01:05.761
Grace!

01:13.682 --> 01:15.510
Grace!

01:17.077 --> 01:19.514
Grace!

01:19.557 --> 01:21.777
Hey. Can you move?

01:21.820 --> 01:23.692
I think so.

01:23.735 --> 01:24.954
You hit your head pretty hard.

01:24.997 --> 01:27.174
You're lucky
it's still attached.

01:27.217 --> 01:29.089
I've got to get
to the White House.

01:29.132 --> 01:31.308
Hey, listen. We have
to get out of here

01:31.352 --> 01:34.006
before whoever did this
comes to finish off the job.

01:36.008 --> 01:38.228
Wait, wait.

01:38.272 --> 01:40.839
Let's go!

01:51.198 --> 01:53.374
Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.550
We're not getting a clean enough
edge on the truss,

01:55.593 --> 01:58.509
even with the laser.
It could fray the sail.

01:58.553 --> 02:00.772
This looks more arts and crafts
than save the world science.

02:00.816 --> 02:02.687
Do we have a materials expert?

02:02.731 --> 02:04.080
Dr. Aguirre was supposed
to be here, but...

02:04.124 --> 02:06.213
Oh, I know, I know,
Raul Aguirre was a no-show.

02:06.256 --> 02:07.779
Who else do we have, Chandra?

02:07.823 --> 02:09.999
Just him.
Liam?

02:10.042 --> 02:11.783
Do we have
a materials science expert?

02:11.827 --> 02:13.350
We have bigger problems
than that.

02:13.394 --> 02:16.875
I need you to come with me, now.

02:19.008 --> 02:21.184
Ooh, you're taking me
to the Treehouse.

02:21.228 --> 02:22.707
I thought this was
the RE/SYST clubhouse,

02:22.751 --> 02:24.709
members only. Or is
it like the gym,

02:24.753 --> 02:26.058
do you get to
bring a guest?

02:26.102 --> 02:30.324
No joke, we're in trouble.

02:36.721 --> 02:39.724
MAN : Attention.
We are with Monroe Bennett,

02:39.768 --> 02:42.684
the legitimate President
of the United States.

02:42.727 --> 02:45.861
All Mackenzie forces
must stand down,

02:45.904 --> 02:48.080
or you will
be brought to justice.

02:48.124 --> 02:51.127
I repeat: you will be
brought to justice.

02:52.911 --> 02:54.696
The net's still off.

02:54.739 --> 02:57.742
Cell service is jammed.

02:57.786 --> 02:59.788
I need a landline.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.225
ALONZO:
Look.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.792
Over there.
Let's head for that building.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.666
All right, stay close.

03:13.802 --> 03:17.458
MAN: Attention.
We are with Monroe Bennett,

03:17.501 --> 03:19.329
the legitimate President
of the United States.

03:19.373 --> 03:22.550
All Mackenzie forces
must stand down,

03:22.593 --> 03:25.379
or you will
be brought to justice.

03:25.422 --> 03:28.382
I repeat: you will
be brought to justice.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.384
I can't reach her.

03:30.427 --> 03:31.950
We let her go out there, Harris.

03:31.994 --> 03:33.735
I did.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.302
Search and rescue is on
the way, as soon as we get

03:35.345 --> 03:36.999
air support from the 192nd.

03:37.042 --> 03:38.566
ELLA:
Mr. Vice President.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.611
It's Grace.

03:41.786 --> 03:44.136
Grace, are you all right?

03:44.180 --> 03:47.401
Yeah, except for the fact
that I can't send this video,

03:47.444 --> 03:49.403
and there are
Bennett troops everywhere.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.405
We've deployed
the National Guard,

03:51.448 --> 03:53.755
but the city's under siege.
Where are you?

03:53.798 --> 03:55.800
We're about four blocks away.

03:55.844 --> 03:57.280
"We"?

03:57.324 --> 03:58.803
Yeah, I'm with a policeman.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.805
Detective Alonzo Carter.Give us your exact location,

04:00.849 --> 04:02.024
and we'll send an escort

04:02.067 --> 04:04.026
with all the bells and whistles.Okay.

04:04.069 --> 04:06.028
Hello?

04:06.071 --> 04:08.073
Hello?

04:08.117 --> 04:10.162
Grace

04:10.206 --> 04:11.729
Get her back.

04:11.773 --> 04:14.036
The detective she's with,
Alonzo Carter.

04:14.079 --> 04:16.386
He's Claire Rayburn's brother.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.606
Whose side is he on?

04:18.649 --> 04:19.955
I have no idea.

04:19.998 --> 04:21.522
Sir,
it's not working.

04:21.565 --> 04:22.392
The lines are down.

04:22.436 --> 04:23.350
That's impossible.

04:23.393 --> 04:24.699
Move to backup channels.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.266
I'm trying, sir.
There's nothing.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.921
WOMAN :
Attention, White House staff.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.619
Due to a security breach,

04:31.662 --> 04:33.403
the White House is in official
lockdown protocol.

04:33.447 --> 04:36.319
Stay in your secure locations...

04:36.363 --> 04:37.842
The alarm was tripped
on the South Lawn.

04:37.886 --> 04:39.366
We need to get you
to safety, sir.

04:39.409 --> 04:40.976
DARIUS:
Mackenzie.

04:41.019 --> 04:43.848
We need her to reboot
the Internet, now.

04:43.892 --> 04:46.068
Attention, White House staff.
Due to a security breach,

04:46.111 --> 04:48.810
the White House is in
official lockdown protocol.

04:48.853 --> 04:50.768
Stay in your secure locations

04:50.812 --> 04:52.074
until further notice.We just went into lockdown.

04:52.117 --> 04:56.383
Meaning no one
gets in... or out?

04:56.426 --> 04:59.211
Well, my DoD orders are
to put this eyes-only communiquÃ©

04:59.255 --> 05:03.303
in front of Vice President Tanz,
so I guess I'm in.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.697
When your friend Darius
shut down the Internet,

05:06.741 --> 05:08.917
he triggered a
fail-safe protocol.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.485
Well, first, he's not
my friend, and second,

05:11.528 --> 05:12.921
what the hell
are you talking about?

05:12.964 --> 05:15.967
The satellite dish that
controls the ICBM signal,

05:16.011 --> 05:17.882
the one carrying
those 13 warheads?

05:17.926 --> 05:20.624
It's run remotely,
somewhere in Alaska.

05:20.668 --> 05:23.453
When the Internet went down,
so did the satellite.

05:23.497 --> 05:26.587
So RE/SYST have lost contact
with the missile?

05:26.630 --> 05:30.025
The ICBM sends a ping to the
sat dish every four hours.

05:30.068 --> 05:32.027
If the missile gets a response,
it continues on course,

05:32.070 --> 05:33.376
in low Earth orbit.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.857
But just now,
it didn't get a response.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.989
It's gonna try again
in another four hours.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.251
If there's still no answer,

05:39.295 --> 05:41.253
a fail-safe protocol
will be triggered.

05:41.297 --> 05:42.472
Okay, which is...
which is what?

05:42.516 --> 05:43.908
See for yourself.

05:47.912 --> 05:51.916
The warheads will drop on
all 13 preprogrammed targets,

05:51.960 --> 05:53.918
Paris, London, New York...

05:53.962 --> 05:57.357
And here, Liam.
Washington D.C.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.626
I thought we had a perimeter
around the White House.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.410
We do. Someone must
have slipped through.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.760
Slipped through?
That's comforting.

06:09.804 --> 06:11.153
Don't worry.
We're in lockdown.

06:11.196 --> 06:12.633
Dozens of Secret Service
are sweeping the grounds.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.199
We've got bulletproof glass,

06:14.243 --> 06:16.201
steel core doors
that can handle a bazooka.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.378
This place is a fortress.
No one can get in.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.250
Or out.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.427
Bennett's already had a mole
in the White House.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.734
What if there are more
and this was just a ploy?

06:26.777 --> 06:28.213
The threat may
already be inside.

06:28.257 --> 06:30.651
If you're right,

06:30.694 --> 06:33.088
we may have just locked
ourselves in with the enemy.

06:37.092 --> 06:39.007
We've triggered
the lockdown, sir.

06:39.050 --> 06:41.052
Stage one is complete.

06:41.096 --> 06:43.968
The outer perimeter is manned
by troops loyal to our cause.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.971
We've disabled the landlines,
jammed cellular communications.

06:47.015 --> 06:49.452
The White House
is completely cut off.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.454
And stage two?

06:51.498 --> 06:53.369
COLTER:
Already in progress.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.415
We've infiltrated the East Wing.
Once that's secure,

06:55.458 --> 06:58.592
we'll move to stage
three, the Residence.

06:58.635 --> 06:59.984
And then stage four,
the West Wing.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.595
We'll launch a small
frontal assault

07:01.638 --> 07:03.466
on the West Wing entrances here

07:03.510 --> 07:05.947
and here, as a diversion.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.514
While they're
distracted...We rise up from below,

07:07.557 --> 07:08.776
right under their noses.

07:08.819 --> 07:10.125
And then this nation

07:10.168 --> 07:14.521
will finally have
the leader it deserves.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.566
âª

07:30.188 --> 07:31.668
[sirens wailing,
gunfire in distance]

07:31.712 --> 07:33.104
No cell,

07:33.148 --> 07:34.758
no White House landline,
no Internet.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.499
This is insane.

07:36.543 --> 07:41.243
I have a recording on here
of Justice Cheng's decision

07:41.286 --> 07:44.289
in Mackenzie's favor,
and no way to get the word out.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.248
Mackenzie's the legal president?

07:46.291 --> 07:48.119
Yeah.

07:48.163 --> 07:50.644
CHENG :
And so, the rightful President

07:50.687 --> 07:52.384
of the United States,

07:52.428 --> 07:56.084
pursuant to the 25th Amendment,

07:56.127 --> 07:59.348
is Pauline Mackenzie.

07:59.391 --> 08:01.785
By a five-to-four ruling
of the Supreme Court.

08:01.829 --> 08:04.484
And this video
is the only evidence of it.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.964
When this decision goes public,
Bennett will have to stand down

08:07.008 --> 08:08.444
or face
criminal charges.

08:10.054 --> 08:11.665
MAN:
Hands where we can see 'em!

08:11.708 --> 08:14.494
MAN 2 :
Step away and let me
see your hands!

08:14.537 --> 08:16.234
Step away from the building

08:16.278 --> 08:18.367
and show me your hands.

08:20.282 --> 08:23.111
Then we need to get this
video to the White House.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.287
"We"? You don't have to...

08:25.330 --> 08:27.332
The mission of Metro Police
Department is to safeguard

08:27.376 --> 08:30.510
the District of Columbia
and protect its residents.

08:30.553 --> 08:32.512
Are you a resident
of D.C., Grace?

08:32.555 --> 08:33.774
I am.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.645
Then you are on my beat.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.039
How do I know I can trust you?

08:38.082 --> 08:39.562
You don't.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.521
But frankly, I'm all you got.

08:43.305 --> 08:46.134
:
All right? Okay.

08:48.702 --> 08:52.314
Mr. Secretary,
landlines are down,

08:52.357 --> 08:54.272
cell phones are jammed,
I can't even

08:54.316 --> 08:56.274
reach the Pentagon
to launch a missile, let alone

08:56.318 --> 08:57.537
turn the Internet back on.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.929
Harris, what the hell
is happening here?

08:58.973 --> 09:00.322
The White House is compromised.

09:00.365 --> 09:02.672
General Wallace clearly
wasn't the only mole.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.326
He's patient zero,
and we don't know how far

09:04.369 --> 09:06.241
the virus has spread.The lockdown may have left

09:06.284 --> 09:08.286
some of Bennett's men
on the inside, which is why

09:08.330 --> 09:09.723
we need to get you out of here.

09:09.766 --> 09:11.725
Bennett's got control
of the perimeter. Our troops

09:11.768 --> 09:13.335
will have to pierce the line.
There's no telling

09:13.378 --> 09:14.902
when they'll get here.

09:14.945 --> 09:17.600
The emergency bunker is secure
and waiting for you, ma'am.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.994
No. I cannot.

09:20.037 --> 09:22.170
I will not abandon this post.

09:22.213 --> 09:25.260
Madam President, you can still
lead the country from the safety

09:25.303 --> 09:26.914
of the bunker.
The Oval Office,

09:26.957 --> 09:28.350
it's just a room.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.439
Oh, come on, Harris.
You know better than that.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.962
There's a reason
the royal family

09:32.006 --> 09:34.356
stayed in Buckingham Palace
during World War II.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.663
Better a living president
than a dead symbol.

09:36.706 --> 09:39.143
But symbols matter,
Mr. Vice President.

09:39.187 --> 09:40.623
It's why we don't allow
the United States flag

09:40.667 --> 09:43.060
to ever touch the ground.

09:43.104 --> 09:45.933
So if Mr. Bennett wants me out
of the White House,

09:45.976 --> 09:47.717
he'll have to kill me first.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.589
This time, for real.

09:49.632 --> 09:52.200
Secretary Edwards,
I need you to escort

09:52.243 --> 09:55.290
Vice President Tanz
down to the emergency bunker.

09:55.333 --> 09:58.554
And this is not a request.
This is an order.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.469
Madam President,
Grace Barrows is out there

10:00.512 --> 10:02.384
with that video.
We need to find her

10:02.427 --> 10:03.951
and broadcast
Justice Cheng's decision.

10:03.994 --> 10:06.954
She-she's the only one
who can stop this madness.

10:06.997 --> 10:10.044
Darius, please.
You are the vice president.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.614
There is a protocol here
and I need you to follow it.

10:14.657 --> 10:17.138
One of us has to be down
in that bunker.

10:20.271 --> 10:23.057
Agent Kelly, Troy, let's go.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.409
If we make it
through the night,

10:27.452 --> 10:30.499
we are having a very rare
single malt for breakfast.

10:30.542 --> 10:33.197
It's a date.

10:33.241 --> 10:36.070
Attention, White House staff.
Due to a security breach,

10:36.113 --> 10:39.377
the White House is in
official lockdown protocol.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.684
Stay in your secure locations
until further notice.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.122
Cover the windows,
lock all doors,

10:45.166 --> 10:46.863
wait for further instructions.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.386
Check and check.

10:53.174 --> 10:56.003
You have any idea what this
communiquÃ© is for Darius?

10:56.046 --> 10:59.049
Uh, no, but General Marciano
said it was top priority.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.667
No, no, no.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.320
Jillian, no, no, no.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.409
This... this is way not cool.

11:11.453 --> 11:12.584
Yeah, well, we can't
really worry about

11:12.628 --> 11:14.195
what's cool right now, Nate.

11:14.238 --> 11:16.676
If it's a priority,
we need to prioritize it.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.249
What?

11:25.293 --> 11:27.382
They're pulling the Virginia
National Guard troops

11:27.425 --> 11:29.427
assigned to protect
the rail gun.

11:29.471 --> 11:32.779
They need them here
at the capital.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.216
It's the one project
that could save the world.

11:35.259 --> 11:37.522
I-It's completely vulnerable.

11:37.566 --> 11:38.741
I need to contact
Dr. Stendahl,

11:38.785 --> 11:40.308
the project supervisor.How?

11:40.351 --> 11:42.397
The cell and landlines are
jammed, and the net's down.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.921
There may be another way.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.018
Sir, we have to keep moving.

11:55.062 --> 11:57.368
I agree, but not
in that direction.

11:57.412 --> 12:00.458
I'm sorry, Harris,
but I'm gonna find Grace.Darius...

12:00.502 --> 12:02.025
She's within four blocks
of the White House, Harris.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.766
We have to get to her
before Bennett's men do.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.507
Darius, I know you
want to protect her,

12:05.550 --> 12:07.422
but that's not your job.Well, frankly,
Mr. Secretary,

12:07.465 --> 12:09.250
I don't give a damn.So you're going to disobey

12:09.293 --> 12:12.296
a direct order from the
President of the United States?

12:12.340 --> 12:15.256
Look, there's a '70s-era analog
Emergency Broadcast Center

12:15.299 --> 12:16.300
underneath the West Wing.

12:16.344 --> 12:17.780
If we get Grace
back here safely,

12:17.824 --> 12:19.303
we can use that to broadcast
Cheng's video to the world.

12:19.347 --> 12:20.783
We won't need the Internet.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.437
How the hell do you know this?

12:22.480 --> 12:24.395
When I refurbished
the attic as my office,

12:24.439 --> 12:26.484
I studied the White House plans
dating back to the '20s.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.138
And you memorized them?

12:28.182 --> 12:30.488
Of course you did.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.534
All right.

12:32.577 --> 12:34.318
If we're gonna do this,
let's do it right.

12:34.362 --> 12:37.669
Kelly, take point.
Troy, on our six.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.323
Stay close.

12:39.367 --> 12:43.153
Well, that was easy. Ish.

12:46.374 --> 12:47.767
SOLDIER :
Team, fan out.

12:47.810 --> 12:50.639
Search the area.
The objective is Grace Barrows.

12:50.682 --> 12:53.773
She's to be taken alive.
I say again, taken alive.

12:58.038 --> 13:00.649
Tess, can you determine
the IP address

13:00.692 --> 13:02.085
from the satellite dish

13:02.129 --> 13:04.131
so that we can send
a mimic signal to the missile?

13:04.174 --> 13:05.828
TESS:
Searching now, Alycia.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.352
How could RE/SYST be
this stupid?

13:08.396 --> 13:09.440
No one anticipated
this turn of events.

13:09.484 --> 13:11.834
No one could have.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.097
No?
No one could have anticipated

13:14.141 --> 13:15.838
that playing chicken
with nuclear warheads

13:15.882 --> 13:17.274
can end in disaster?

13:17.318 --> 13:19.233
TESS:
I'm sorry, Alycia,

13:19.276 --> 13:21.626
I cannot replicate the signal.

13:21.670 --> 13:24.934
Okay, okay, we'll figure
this out, we have to.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.631
No, no, no, Alycia,
we're at a dead end.

13:26.675 --> 13:29.939
Emphasis on "dead."
This is... it.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.468
What the hell are you doing?

13:37.512 --> 13:39.253
What needs to be done.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.863
Liam, no, he won't
believe you, he won't help.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.473
He knows me
well enough to know

13:42.517 --> 13:44.780
when I am genuinely
terrified, which I am.

14:07.977 --> 14:09.587
Who's there?

14:14.157 --> 14:17.117
Hey, it's cool.
I'm a D.C. cop.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.509
Hands in the air.
Hey!

14:18.553 --> 14:20.685
I'm a cop, it's all right.Who's with you?

14:20.729 --> 14:21.861
Come out from behind there.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.474
What's your name, ma'am?

14:26.517 --> 14:27.954
Her name is her business.

14:27.997 --> 14:28.911
She's an unarmed civilian.Shut up.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.217
Answer the question, ma'am.

14:33.350 --> 14:36.353
I said answer
the question, ma'am.

14:38.138 --> 14:39.617
No!

14:42.011 --> 14:43.795
ALONZO:
Grace!

14:43.839 --> 14:45.145
Damn it.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.537
What the--
I thought he hit you.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.539
Bulletproof shirt.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.368
Yeah, I can see that now.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.196
You all right?
Yeah.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.068
Knocked the wind
out of me.

14:55.111 --> 14:56.591
I'm okay.
All right.

14:59.028 --> 15:01.683
You're one crazy-ass lady.
You know that, right?

15:01.726 --> 15:03.903
So I've been told.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.948
SOLDIER :
Vasquez, this is Bravo 12.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.081
Report. Over.

15:10.387 --> 15:13.956
Vasquez,
where the hell are you?

15:14.000 --> 15:17.960
This is Vasquez. Bad reception
in this structure, over.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.701
SOLDIER: We're still looking
for Grace Barrows.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.137
Female. Reddish-blonde.

15:21.181 --> 15:25.489
Five foot seven.
Wanted, preferably alive.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.448
Saw a woman by that description.

15:29.145 --> 15:32.627
Subject is headed north
on 17th.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.194
SOLDIER: Roger that.
We're just outside

15:34.237 --> 15:36.587
the parking garage on Foxtrot.
All clear there?

15:36.631 --> 15:38.763
All clear.
Over and out.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.985
We need to wait till the
heat dies down out there.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.682
You're a wanted woman,
Ms. Barrows.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.599
WOMAN :
Attention White House staff,

15:48.643 --> 15:50.384
due to a security breach,

15:50.427 --> 15:52.603
the White House is in
official lockdown protocol.

15:52.647 --> 15:55.345
Stay in your secure locations
until further notice.

15:58.783 --> 16:01.351
No way to know if they're
Bennett's guys or ours.

16:01.395 --> 16:03.832
I'd say we don't want
to find out.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.400
Okay, there's another egress
point through the boiler room.

16:06.443 --> 16:07.531
It's tricky but doable.

16:07.575 --> 16:10.056
Let me guess.
Blueprints from the '20s?

16:10.099 --> 16:12.145
'50s, actually.

16:12.188 --> 16:15.931
Troy, stay at this access point.
Call for backup.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.020
If Bennett or his men try
to get past here, shoot first,

16:18.064 --> 16:20.196
ask questions later,
that's an order.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.764
Yes, sir.
Kelly, move out.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.509
What are you trying
to do, exactly?

16:28.552 --> 16:32.600
Message Dr. Stendahl through the
dark Web gateway Darius set up.

16:32.643 --> 16:33.775
But the Internet isn't working.

16:33.818 --> 16:36.212
Yes. So, the way
that Darius explained it

16:36.256 --> 16:38.040
is the Internet
is the highway,

16:38.084 --> 16:40.564
the dark Web is the sewer
that runs underneath.

16:40.608 --> 16:41.913
Shutting down the DNS servers

16:41.957 --> 16:45.265
brought street traffic
to a halt above ground.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.832
But the sewer tunnels
are still navigable.
Yeah.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.095
If you know the exact
address you're going to.

16:52.315 --> 16:53.490
Which I clearly don't.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.798
I wish I'd paid more attention
when Darius explained this.

16:56.841 --> 16:59.496
Um...
You'll get it.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.498
Chemistry class, you memorized
the entire periodic table

17:01.542 --> 17:03.718
in... 20 minutes.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.155
You were my hero.

17:06.199 --> 17:08.114
Hardly.

17:08.157 --> 17:09.854
And I can't believe
that you remembered that.

17:11.595 --> 17:12.596
I can't believe
you remembered the symbols

17:12.640 --> 17:14.511
for iridium and gallium.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.819
Oh, my God, I did it.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.647
See, you still got it.

17:19.690 --> 17:23.216
Okay, now let's just hope
Dr. Stendahl gets it

17:23.259 --> 17:24.826
before it's too late.

17:26.784 --> 17:29.657
Phone's down.

17:29.700 --> 17:30.658
Something's very wrong
out there.

17:30.701 --> 17:33.095
We need eyes
on the White House.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.836
Okay.

17:38.274 --> 17:40.102
Look at the roof.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.887
The Secret Service snipers,
they're dead.

17:42.931 --> 17:45.934
Alycia, the White House
is under attack.

18:06.824 --> 18:09.218
I don't know him, which means
he's with Bennett.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.963
That hatchway leads
from this boiler room

18:15.006 --> 18:16.095
to the steam tunnels,

18:16.138 --> 18:18.140
and those tunnels...Lead to the streets.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.968
If they put a guard
on this hatch,

18:20.011 --> 18:22.231
then Bennett's people
know these tunnels, too.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.667
There may be more
trouble on the other side.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.980
You all right?

18:32.937 --> 18:35.679
Kel-Kelly.

18:46.821 --> 18:49.911
DARIUS:
Senseless.

18:49.954 --> 18:51.913
The whole damn thing.

18:51.956 --> 18:55.046
Darius, we're on our own now.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.281
DARIUS: Just up there to the
left, there's a stairwell.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.457
It should lead out
to the streets.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.764
HARRIS: Looks like these tunnels
haven't been used since...DARIUS: Prohibition.

19:16.807 --> 19:20.333
President Harding needed a place
to stash all that liquor.

19:20.376 --> 19:24.206
HARRIS: I could sure use some
bathtub gin right about now.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.469
DARIUS.
It's Liam.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.079
The net's back up?

19:28.123 --> 19:30.517
No, he's got my dark Web address
from the rail gun project.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.606
What does he want?

19:32.649 --> 19:34.390
We're about to find out.

19:34.434 --> 19:35.739
Liam, what do you want?

19:35.783 --> 19:37.393
I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

19:37.437 --> 19:39.265
Darius, we have
a major situation.

19:39.308 --> 19:41.702
Why is your problem
my problem?

19:41.745 --> 19:43.486
LIAM: Because when you shut down
the Internet,

19:43.530 --> 19:45.793
you triggered a failsafe
protocol with the nukes.

19:45.836 --> 19:49.231
We now have less than two hours
to get the Internet back on,

19:49.275 --> 19:52.582
or those 13 warheads are coming
down on their original targets.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.889
I don't believe you.
Or should I say her?

19:54.932 --> 19:58.153
You know what, we're looking
at nuclear disaster,

19:58.197 --> 20:00.416
and you think we're lying?Not "we," Ms. Vrettou.

20:00.460 --> 20:03.811
You. I wouldn't believe
a single thing that fell off

20:03.854 --> 20:04.986
that serpent's tongue of yours.

20:05.029 --> 20:06.466
I've seen
the programming myself.

20:06.509 --> 20:07.684
She's right.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.384
You want the Internet back?

20:11.427 --> 20:12.689
You need to help me first.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.778
This is not the time to barter!

20:14.822 --> 20:16.171
DARIUS:
Oh, this is exactly the time.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.738
Grace Barrows is somewhere
in a four-block radius

20:17.781 --> 20:18.913
of the White House.
I need you to use

20:18.956 --> 20:20.393
Tanz surveillance to find her.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.830
No, we don't take
orders from you.

20:22.873 --> 20:24.266
Fine. Then lose my number.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.921
What an ass!

20:26.964 --> 20:28.879
I can't believe
he's pulling this stunt.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.751
We're facing nuclear
annihilation and..,.

20:30.794 --> 20:32.840
Alycia, this isn't
about you and Darius.

20:32.883 --> 20:34.494
The world does not have time
for your BS.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.670
I need you to get me that
satellite linkup now.

20:36.713 --> 20:38.106
What if they're
telling the truth?

20:38.149 --> 20:39.412
They very well might be.

20:39.455 --> 20:40.630
But to turn
the net back on,

20:40.674 --> 20:41.675
we need to take back
the White House.

20:41.718 --> 20:42.632
To take back
the White House,

20:42.676 --> 20:44.591
we need that video.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.680
One problem at
a time, Harris.
Yeah.

20:46.723 --> 20:48.725
They only seem to come
in bulk, these days.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.906
Hello again.

20:55.950 --> 20:58.822
Okay, I've got the Tanz
satellite linkup.

20:58.866 --> 21:00.737
DARIUS:
Activate the temporal
surveillance mode.

21:00.781 --> 21:03.566
Every image for the last
24 hours has been recorded.

21:03.610 --> 21:06.352
If you scroll back to the place
and time we last saw Grace,

21:06.395 --> 21:08.832
you can step forward in time
to track her movements.

21:08.876 --> 21:12.314
Scroll back to 7:56,
D.C. General Hospital.

21:12.358 --> 21:13.837
Find the helicopter crash.

21:13.881 --> 21:15.665
Got it.
Stepping through now.

21:17.972 --> 21:21.236
She's with a man,
African-American, medium build.

21:24.108 --> 21:25.893
It looks like they left
through the service entrance.

21:25.936 --> 21:27.198
They went into a parking garage

21:27.242 --> 21:29.418
at 1803 "G" Street.

21:29.462 --> 21:30.332
DARIUS:
But how close are they?

21:34.728 --> 21:35.816
Three-tenths of a mile from you.Thank you.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.383
Now for the bad news.

21:37.426 --> 21:38.819
We've lost control
of the Internet

21:38.862 --> 21:40.299
and I'm gonna need your help
to get it back.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.779
I knew it. I knew
we shouldn't trust that ass.

21:42.823 --> 21:45.913
Well, either you help us
regain the White House

21:45.956 --> 21:47.871
or we all die. Let me know
what you decide.

21:47.915 --> 21:48.916
Darius, that wasn't the deal...

21:48.959 --> 21:50.134
You're playing quite the game

21:50.178 --> 21:51.310
of chicken here, Darius.

21:51.353 --> 21:54.835
Sun Tzu said,
"Know thy enemy."

21:54.878 --> 21:57.490
And I do... well.

21:58.926 --> 22:01.363
He hung up.

22:01.407 --> 22:02.451
Shocker.

22:02.495 --> 22:03.800
What are you doing?

22:03.844 --> 22:05.193
There's a revolution out there.

22:05.236 --> 22:06.847
He's outnumbered 50 to one.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.544
We have to improve those odds.

22:08.588 --> 22:11.982
The world doesn't have time
for my BS right now.

22:21.905 --> 22:23.603
Hey, wait, wait.

22:23.646 --> 22:25.822
I can't let you
out there.Like hell you can't.

22:25.866 --> 22:29.565
That parking garage is
a stone's throw away, Harris.A stone's throw in a war zone.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.045
You're one of the most
famous people in the world.

22:31.088 --> 22:32.873
You'll be dead or captured
in five seconds.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.396
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.963
Yeah, but you shouldn't.

22:36.006 --> 22:37.747
You're the vice president
of the United States,

22:37.791 --> 22:39.967
second in command to
our nation's leader.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.447
In the ultimate
time of crisis,

22:41.490 --> 22:43.492
you have to use your
head, not your heart.

22:44.711 --> 22:47.409
If we lose both
Mackenzie and you,

22:47.453 --> 22:49.411
the chaos will
be irreversible.

22:52.371 --> 22:56.462
For the record, this is
the worst job I've ever had.

22:56.505 --> 22:59.900
Like you've ever had
a crappy summer job. Here.

22:59.943 --> 23:03.686
Bring her back, Mr. Secretary.
That's an order.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.819
Sir, yes, sir.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.302
SOLDIER:
Bravo Team, to the right!

23:11.346 --> 23:12.695
MAN :
Make sure to have any

23:12.739 --> 23:17.221
valid identification on you
and clearly visible.

23:26.666 --> 23:29.451
I can't just sit here.

23:29.495 --> 23:30.844
It's crazy-making.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.585
We just have
to wait it out.

23:32.628 --> 23:34.500
Accept what is, you know?
We can't do anything about it.

23:34.543 --> 23:37.459
"Accept what is"?
That's a Zen approach.

23:37.503 --> 23:40.810
It's a C.O.P.E. approach,
actually.

23:40.854 --> 23:42.725
Children of Planet Earth.

23:42.769 --> 23:44.031
Was that the self-help group

23:44.074 --> 23:45.424
with the guy who wrote
all those books?

23:45.467 --> 23:47.817
Bass Shepherd, yeah.

23:47.861 --> 23:51.604
I, uh, I've been going to
meetings since all this started,

23:51.647 --> 23:54.171
dumb as it sounds.

23:54.215 --> 23:57.044
It sounds completely
sane at this point.

23:57.087 --> 23:59.481
Is that what
it teaches you?

23:59.525 --> 24:01.048
Positive thinking?

24:01.091 --> 24:05.748
No, just...
accept what is.

24:05.792 --> 24:08.011
You know, we're here
in the middle of a battle.

24:08.055 --> 24:09.665
Nothing we can
do about it.

24:09.709 --> 24:12.102
It's scary.

24:12.146 --> 24:13.974
We might die.

24:14.017 --> 24:17.456
Or... we might live.

24:19.762 --> 24:21.547
Maybe I can even
take you to dinner.

24:21.590 --> 24:24.114
Maybe.

24:41.741 --> 24:44.526
Well, look what the cat
dragged in.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.833
Detective, I don't want trouble.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.399
I'm looking for Grace.

24:48.443 --> 24:51.402
Harris?

24:51.446 --> 24:52.882
You all right?

24:52.926 --> 24:53.970
GRACE:
Yeah.

24:54.014 --> 24:56.495
Yeah, I'm okay,
I'm okay.

24:56.538 --> 24:57.800
Thanks to him.

25:00.020 --> 25:03.153
We need to get back
to the White House,

25:03.197 --> 25:04.590
but the streets are crawling
with Bennett's men

25:04.633 --> 25:05.765
looking for you
and that video.

25:05.808 --> 25:08.202
I can help.

25:08.245 --> 25:11.771
I ran security detail on the
ground for the inauguration.

25:11.814 --> 25:13.599
I know every nook and cranny
of the city.

25:13.642 --> 25:15.296
Every alley.

25:15.339 --> 25:18.995
All right. Let's move.

25:21.302 --> 25:22.390
Liam.

25:22.433 --> 25:23.652
We've overlaid
thermal sat images

25:23.696 --> 25:25.045
on the White
House blueprints.

25:25.088 --> 25:26.873
It looks like
the East Wing

25:26.916 --> 25:28.135
and the Residence are
overrun with soldiers.

25:28.178 --> 25:29.353
Bennett's taken them.

25:29.397 --> 25:30.485
What about the West Wing?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.052
Don't see any
infiltration there,

25:32.095 --> 25:33.749
but there might be people
in the attic.

25:33.793 --> 25:36.143
Do you think
Jillian's okay?

25:36.186 --> 25:38.275
Jillian is in the safest place
in the West Wing right now

25:38.319 --> 25:39.886
as no one would think
to look there.

25:39.929 --> 25:41.844
Thank you for the information.

25:41.888 --> 25:43.672
That was Alycia's doing.

25:43.716 --> 25:45.892
But listen, I think we need
a plan "B" for these missiles,

25:45.935 --> 25:47.502
in case...What?

25:47.546 --> 25:48.677
We don't get
the White House back?

25:48.721 --> 25:50.244
ALYCIA:
Okay, here's an idea.

25:50.287 --> 25:52.681
You give us the president's
authorization code.

25:52.725 --> 25:54.378
We use it to hack into the
Pentagon's security barrier

25:54.422 --> 25:56.337
and get the Internet back up.

25:56.380 --> 25:58.339
Why do you need the president's
authorization code?

25:58.382 --> 26:00.167
RE/SYST hacked
Russia's missiles.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.430
Surely the Pentagon would be
a piece of cake.

26:02.473 --> 26:04.911
Let's just say we had a little
more lead time with that one.

26:04.954 --> 26:07.217
Look, we've tried getting
inside the Pentagon

26:07.261 --> 26:08.479
without success.

26:08.523 --> 26:09.872
We need some help.

26:09.916 --> 26:12.614
Why is this suddenly sounding
very suspicious?

26:12.658 --> 26:15.225
I just helped you,
damn it.

26:15.269 --> 26:17.445
Yes. You did.

26:17.488 --> 26:19.360
I have to go.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.716
Grace.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.854
He still thinks
I'm lying,

26:34.897 --> 26:36.682
that this is
some sort of ruse.

26:36.725 --> 26:38.640
Well, RE/SYST doesn't have
the best track record

26:38.684 --> 26:39.946
when it comes to
full transparency.

26:39.989 --> 26:42.426
Oh, so you think
I'm making this up?

26:42.470 --> 26:44.907
I didn't say that.

26:44.951 --> 26:46.996
We have 53 minutes.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.172
I'm moving those scientists
into the bunker.

26:49.216 --> 26:52.436
You can come or not.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.264
Alonzo got me here safe.

26:54.308 --> 26:55.875
DARIUS:
Good work.

26:55.918 --> 26:58.529
You left out a little detail
in our last meeting, Detective.

26:58.573 --> 27:00.880
You're Claire
Rayburn's brother.Yeah, and proud of it.

27:00.923 --> 27:04.274
Proud of her attempt to
assassinate President Mackenzie?

27:05.798 --> 27:07.930
How do we know you're
not with Bennett?

27:07.974 --> 27:09.323
You know, pretty soon
we're gonna be past the point

27:09.366 --> 27:10.280
of civilized conversation.GRACE: Okay, stop.

27:10.324 --> 27:11.760
Stop, stop.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.196
If Alonzo wanted
the recording of Justice Cheng

27:13.240 --> 27:14.807
he could've taken it
from me hours ago.

27:17.418 --> 27:18.767
Liam told me

27:18.811 --> 27:20.551
the East Wing and
the Residences are down.

27:20.595 --> 27:22.162
The West Wing hasn't
been infiltrated yet.

27:22.205 --> 27:23.729
We've got a window to get
to the old broadcast center

27:23.772 --> 27:26.122
and get that video
out into the world.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.343
We're not alone.

27:29.386 --> 27:31.562
Darius, Grace, you need
to find a safe place.

27:31.606 --> 27:32.999
BOTH:
There's an old wine cellar.

27:34.130 --> 27:35.871
D.C. police.

27:35.915 --> 27:38.352
We know where all the
bodies are buried.

27:38.395 --> 27:40.702
P.S., it locks
from the inside, all right?

27:40.746 --> 27:42.661
Now that I did not know.HARRIS:
All right.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.672
Give me your...

27:57.850 --> 28:00.766
God bless Prohibition
and President Harding's

28:00.809 --> 28:02.332
affinity for cabernet.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.296
And God bless America.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.657
Down!

28:38.194 --> 28:41.197
You okay?
You hit?
Yeah.

28:41.241 --> 28:43.765
You all right?
I'm good,
I'm good, I'm good.

28:51.730 --> 28:52.774
Get down!

28:54.167 --> 28:55.821
Can you move?

28:55.864 --> 28:57.736
Yeah, I can move.We got to get the
hell out of here.

28:57.779 --> 28:58.737
Let's go. Come on.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.740
Come on, go, go.

29:18.321 --> 29:20.236
Damn it, what's happening?

29:20.280 --> 29:22.630
Bravo Team, give me
a sitrep, please.

29:22.673 --> 29:25.546
SOLDIER: All clear.
Moving up the tunnel.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.896
General, good work.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.942
You and your men are patriots.

29:32.118 --> 29:35.295
And your country thanks you.

29:38.864 --> 29:42.258
Well... alone at last.

29:42.302 --> 29:44.304
You take me to
the nicest places.

29:46.523 --> 29:49.526
I'm glad
you're all right.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.887
Now?

30:01.930 --> 30:03.845
Really?

30:03.889 --> 30:05.847
It's just you and me.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.504
I need to know why
you went out there,

30:10.547 --> 30:12.854
risked your life.
Darius.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.682
I'm trying to protect you.

30:14.725 --> 30:16.466
That's not your job.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.338
Yes, it is.
You're the vice president.

30:18.381 --> 30:20.644
Your role is too important
to be compromised by me

30:20.688 --> 30:23.082
in any way.
Vice president,

30:23.125 --> 30:26.999
vice president, the-the most
useless job in American history.

30:27.042 --> 30:29.044
Until now.

30:31.568 --> 30:32.526
Why can't you

30:32.569 --> 30:35.311
just leave it alone?

30:35.355 --> 30:38.314
Because you're
tortured by something

30:38.358 --> 30:39.881
and I can't stand
to watch anymore.

30:39.925 --> 30:42.623
Then please,
stop watching.

30:42.666 --> 30:45.408
What if I don't want to?

30:52.415 --> 30:54.374
It's Harris.
Open up.

30:59.988 --> 31:01.990
Oh, my God.

31:03.383 --> 31:05.385
Are you all right?
Yeah.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.300
Tunnels have
been breached.

31:07.343 --> 31:09.998
The West Wing is under siege.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.177
As the communication blackout
of the White House continues,

31:15.221 --> 31:18.528
no word as to what's going on
inside those walls.

31:18.572 --> 31:20.095
Meanwhile, multiple
reports of gunfire

31:20.139 --> 31:21.923
and increased military presence

31:21.967 --> 31:23.403
in and around the D.C. area
are flooding in.

31:23.446 --> 31:24.534
Gentlemen.

31:24.578 --> 31:26.188
Stay with us for
continuous news updates.

31:26.232 --> 31:27.886
MACKENZIE: I release you
from your duty to me.

31:27.929 --> 31:30.279
None of you have to die today.

31:30.323 --> 31:31.890
It wouldn't serve any purpose.

31:31.933 --> 31:35.371
But I will not be abandoning
this office, for if we lose

31:35.415 --> 31:39.854
to Monroe Bennett, we lose
the soul of this nation.

31:39.898 --> 31:43.292
And I will not let that happen
without a fight.

31:43.336 --> 31:44.946
Ma'am.

31:46.165 --> 31:47.296
We're not going anywhere.

31:47.340 --> 31:48.645
Let's get that couch
up against the door

31:48.689 --> 31:50.473
and let's get you
behind the desk.

31:50.517 --> 31:51.910
Thank you.

32:00.570 --> 32:01.920
Hey, Tess, do you remember

32:01.963 --> 32:03.399
when all we had to worry about
was an asteroid?

32:03.443 --> 32:05.488
TESS:
No, Liam.

32:05.532 --> 32:06.925
Me, either.

32:06.968 --> 32:09.101
I miss our talks.

32:09.144 --> 32:11.016
ALYCIA:
I miss ours.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.976
Thought you were going down
to the bunker.

32:15.020 --> 32:18.197
It seemed much less...

32:18.240 --> 32:20.851
fun, somehow.

32:20.895 --> 32:25.682
Might as well die
with someone I like.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.554
So this is really happening.

32:27.597 --> 32:29.817
Of course it is.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.601
No, Darius will pull through.

32:31.645 --> 32:34.822
He'll get control
of the White House somehow.

32:34.865 --> 32:38.695
Why do you need Darius
to be the hero?

32:38.739 --> 32:41.829
Why do you need him
to be the villain?

32:45.050 --> 32:46.529
Daddy issues.

32:46.573 --> 32:50.185
Yeah, same.

32:50.229 --> 32:52.187
I didn't really have one.

32:54.146 --> 32:57.018
Well, I did, and he was
a real son of a bitch.

32:58.454 --> 33:01.588
Human beings, we can be
a real pile of manure.

33:04.721 --> 33:06.767
I'll drink to that.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.987
Drink?

33:23.610 --> 33:25.655
To friendship.

33:27.179 --> 33:29.181
It's been fun.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.331
Maybe it's the good guys.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.593
Maybe.

33:53.161 --> 33:54.989
Maybe it's
Dr. Stendahl.

33:58.775 --> 34:00.038
"Thank you for the warning.

34:00.081 --> 34:02.127
"We were able to fortify
security as a result.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.389
The rail gun is safe."

34:03.432 --> 34:05.608
NATE: See,
you really are

34:05.652 --> 34:07.784
a hero.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.615
SOLDIER: Contact up here, sir.

34:21.146 --> 34:22.973
Now that Bennett's
soldiers are in,

34:23.017 --> 34:25.585
we'll never make it to the
Emergency Broadcast Center.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.282
Harris, we have to deal
with those nukes.

34:27.326 --> 34:28.718
What nukes?

34:28.762 --> 34:30.024
It's a long story, but w...

34:30.068 --> 34:32.592
We have to surrender, now.

34:32.635 --> 34:33.767
And then what?

34:35.508 --> 34:37.118
Th-The first thing Bennett'll do

34:37.162 --> 34:39.077
is turn on the Internet
to announce his victory.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.600
It's his megaphone of choice.

34:40.643 --> 34:42.123
Bennett's no fool.

34:42.167 --> 34:43.907
He knows that video
is out there.

34:43.951 --> 34:46.040
He won't turn on the net
till he's got it in hand.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.824
So let's give
it to him.

34:49.826 --> 34:51.045
I have a way out
of all this,

34:51.089 --> 34:52.742
it's just dependent
on one thing:

34:52.786 --> 34:54.701
RE/SYST.

35:03.579 --> 35:05.190
Darius?

35:05.233 --> 35:07.235
Liam, what if I told you
I believed you?

35:07.279 --> 35:09.411
ALYCIA:
A lot of good that does us.

35:09.455 --> 35:10.369
We're out of time.

35:10.412 --> 35:11.631
DARIUS:
No, we're not.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.198
But we have to trust
each other right now.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.722
I know that seems impossible,
but we have no choice.

35:15.765 --> 35:17.506
What do you need from us?

35:17.550 --> 35:19.943
I'm sending you something,
a video.

35:19.987 --> 35:22.511
Here's what I need you to do...

35:35.655 --> 35:38.179
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.181
I'm safer down here
than you are up there.

35:41.617 --> 35:42.618
Good luck, Grace.

35:46.492 --> 35:47.841
We got to go.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.162
[pounding against door
continues]

36:05.728 --> 36:07.861
Get ready, men. Get ready.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.915
Don't shoot.
I'm Vice President Tanz.

36:18.959 --> 36:21.527
This is Secretary Edwards
and Grace Barrows.

36:21.570 --> 36:22.789
I believe you're
looking for us.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.094
SOLDIER:
Turn around!

36:24.138 --> 36:26.401
Hands on your head.

36:26.445 --> 36:27.707
You sure this
is gonna work?

36:27.750 --> 36:28.751
No, but this is
all we've got.

36:39.632 --> 36:40.763
SOLDIER:
Shamrock, this is Command.

36:40.807 --> 36:42.156
We've taken the White House.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.202
SOLDIER 2: Roger that, Command,
we're coming home.

36:47.596 --> 36:49.119
WOMAN :
Attention, all personnel.

36:49.163 --> 36:51.426
White House systems
have been restored.

36:58.999 --> 37:00.914
This is President
Monroe Bennett.

37:00.957 --> 37:02.872
The fighting is over.

37:02.916 --> 37:04.787
Supporters of former
President Mackenzie,

37:04.831 --> 37:07.790
lay down your weapons,
surrender peacefully

37:07.834 --> 37:09.879
and no harm will come to you.

37:09.923 --> 37:11.881
Hands in the air!

37:11.925 --> 37:14.101
Hands in the air!
Get to the desk.

37:14.144 --> 37:16.277
Hands on the desk.
Head straight.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.061
BENNETT:
It's time for all of us

37:18.105 --> 37:21.978
to work together, for there
is much work left to be done.

37:22.022 --> 37:24.024
May God bless America.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.810
It's good to be back.

37:27.854 --> 37:29.769
Get this man a medic.

37:29.812 --> 37:33.860
Of course. Sergeant,
get the medic, please.

37:33.903 --> 37:35.470
Hope you enjoyed that, Pauline,

37:35.514 --> 37:37.385
because that's the last order
you're gonna give.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.169
Bennett, this is treason.

37:39.213 --> 37:41.041
I am the rightful President
of the United States

37:41.084 --> 37:42.303
and we both know it.

37:42.347 --> 37:45.524
Not without that
Supreme Court decision.

37:45.567 --> 37:48.178
As Commander in Chief of
the United States, I hereby

37:48.222 --> 37:50.790
place you under arrest for
high crimes against the state.

37:50.833 --> 37:51.834
You're gonna have to
shoot me first

37:51.878 --> 37:53.183
before I surrender
to you, Bennett.

37:53.227 --> 37:55.969
Tempting, but illegal.

37:56.012 --> 37:57.797
This is a nation
of laws, after all.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.408
We have them, sir.

38:00.452 --> 38:02.149
Good, bring them in.

38:02.192 --> 38:03.846
Looks like you're gonna
have some company

38:03.890 --> 38:05.195
in Guantanamo,
Pauline.

38:08.982 --> 38:11.419
Madam President,
are you all right?

38:11.463 --> 38:13.900
I haven't been harmed,
if that's what you're asking.

38:13.943 --> 38:16.511
Harris.

38:16.555 --> 38:17.817
Mr. Tanz, what a pleasure.

38:17.860 --> 38:20.210
And Ms. Barrows.

38:20.254 --> 38:22.169
You're quite the elusive one,
aren't you?

38:22.212 --> 38:23.475
Now hand it over.

38:29.568 --> 38:31.047
Unlock it.

38:35.661 --> 38:39.317
CHENG :
...the rightful President

38:39.360 --> 38:42.232
of the United States,

38:42.276 --> 38:44.887
pursuant to the 25th Amendment,

38:44.931 --> 38:46.976
is Pau...

38:52.895 --> 38:56.551
Oh. There's nothing on here.

38:57.987 --> 38:59.641
What a shame.

38:59.685 --> 39:02.644
Now, let's talk about getting
that Internet back on.

39:02.688 --> 39:05.560
I'm gonna need
the codes, Pauline.

39:05.604 --> 39:07.345
Really?

39:14.177 --> 39:16.571
Let's unjam the phone lines.

39:16.615 --> 39:19.008
And get me the DoD.

39:23.970 --> 39:25.450
ALYCIA:
I knew it.

39:25.493 --> 39:27.930
I knew he wouldn't come through.

39:30.803 --> 39:32.326
TESS:
Internet restored.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.067
Fail-safe protocol disabled.

39:34.110 --> 39:35.851
You sure, Tess?

39:35.895 --> 39:37.418
Yes, Liam.

40:05.272 --> 40:08.057
That bastard came through
after all.

40:11.887 --> 40:14.368
Now we have to come through
for the bastard.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.849
Deal's a deal.

40:25.988 --> 40:28.338
Make sure
that the flag's in the shot.

40:28.382 --> 40:31.951
And the audio's got to
be good, all right? Okay.

40:31.994 --> 40:34.388
We on

40:34.432 --> 40:35.737
Yes, sir.

41:00.806 --> 41:03.417
What the hell's going on here?
What are you looking at?

41:03.461 --> 41:07.116
Damn it, someone
tell me what's going on.

41:09.423 --> 41:12.513
I'm about to address
the nation here.

41:12.557 --> 41:14.384
CHENG: And so...DARIUS:
Justice Cheng's video

41:14.428 --> 41:15.908
has just hit the
airwaves, Bennett.

41:15.951 --> 41:17.910
News stations all over the world
must be broadcasting this.

41:17.953 --> 41:20.782
CHENG: ...pursuant to
the 25th Amendment,

41:20.826 --> 41:25.526
is Pauline Mackenzie.

41:28.050 --> 41:30.052
Truth is out,
you're a criminal.

41:30.096 --> 41:33.447
The news is reporting
you lost, sir.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.101
Mackenzie is the
legal president.

41:35.144 --> 41:38.017
No. No, that's not the news.

41:38.060 --> 41:39.540
That-that is fake news.

41:39.584 --> 41:41.716
The only thing that's fake
is your presidency.

41:41.760 --> 41:44.197
Gentlemen, you've been betrayed
and mislead by Monroe Bennett

41:44.240 --> 41:48.201
and General Colter.Turn it off, now!

41:48.244 --> 41:50.638
I'm still in charge.
I'm still the president.

41:50.682 --> 41:52.161
Not according
to the Supreme Court.

41:52.205 --> 41:55.513
You have your orders, gentlemen.
Get 'em out of here.

41:55.556 --> 41:58.385
Now.
Ma'am.

42:00.039 --> 42:01.649
I don't know what to do.

42:04.434 --> 42:06.567
Yes, you do, soldier.

42:06.611 --> 42:08.569
You heard the truth.
Trust your gut.

42:08.613 --> 42:10.179
Monroe Bennett is not
the president

42:10.223 --> 42:12.704
of the United States,
and he never was.

42:12.747 --> 42:15.445
Soldiers,

42:15.489 --> 42:17.099
I need you to stand down.

42:19.275 --> 42:21.713
Colter...

42:30.069 --> 42:32.898
Gentlemen,

42:32.941 --> 42:34.943
arrest that son of a bitch.

42:44.213 --> 42:47.216
You think this is over?

42:49.131 --> 42:51.003
This was just the beginning.

42:54.659 --> 42:56.574
The beginning of what?
