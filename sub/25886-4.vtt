WEBVTT

00:03.542 --> 00:05.041
[laughs]
Yes!

00:05.041 --> 00:08.083
Time for a good old-fashioned
knuckle-buster!

00:09.000 --> 00:10.208
[grunts]
[chitters]

00:10.208 --> 00:11.750
Sorry.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.417
I don't do old-fashioned.

00:13.417 --> 00:15.041
[grunting]

00:15.041 --> 00:17.000
[Squirrel Girl]
Oh, it's on now!

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Don't leave yet.
[grunts]

00:21.166 --> 00:23.625
[grunts]

00:23.625 --> 00:26.917
You haven't even seen
what we can do.

00:26.917 --> 00:29.208
Embiggen!

00:29.208 --> 00:32.500
[yells]
What she said.
[Tippy-Toe chittering]

00:33.917 --> 00:36.083
[angry chitter]
Sorry about the wax, Tips,

00:36.083 --> 00:38.208
but it's time
for Plan M59.

00:38.208 --> 00:39.250
Go!

00:39.250 --> 00:41.500
[chitters]

00:41.500 --> 00:43.083
[thudding footstep]

00:48.667 --> 00:50.667
[grunts]

00:50.667 --> 00:52.458
[grunts]

00:52.458 --> 00:54.583
Lay off the kawaii kaiju!

00:54.583 --> 00:58.166
Did she run off?
Fat chance!

00:58.166 --> 01:00.041
[grunts]
[grunts]

01:00.041 --> 01:02.166
But she might start
running now.

01:03.709 --> 01:05.709
Hey! I'm gonna get you!

01:05.709 --> 01:07.417
[grunts]
Get off my friend!

01:07.417 --> 01:09.792
Squirrel Girl,
what are you doing?

01:09.792 --> 01:11.625
You've gotta give me
some more space.

01:11.625 --> 01:14.125
I can't stay this big forever.
[yells]

01:14.125 --> 01:15.417
[yelling]

01:15.417 --> 01:17.208
[both grunt]

01:17.208 --> 01:21.291
So much for the unbeatable
Squirrel Girl and, uh--

01:21.291 --> 01:25.208
I don't know--
bendy Ms. Marvel?
[chuckles]

01:25.208 --> 01:27.000
Sorry, S.G.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.291
This isn't the epic team-up
I pictured.

01:29.291 --> 01:31.375
Agreed.

01:31.375 --> 01:34.125
But I think it can be

01:34.125 --> 01:37.250
if we just fight anime-style!

01:37.250 --> 01:38.542
Huh.

01:38.542 --> 01:40.542
With excessively
big weapons?

01:40.542 --> 01:43.709
No. By calling out our attacks,
like this.

01:43.709 --> 01:45.333
Rocket kick, now!

01:45.333 --> 01:47.166
Ha-ha!

01:47.166 --> 01:48.458
[both grunt]

01:52.417 --> 01:55.792
Oh, you think you're
the only animal that can climb?

01:55.792 --> 01:58.792
Upside-down striking frenzy!

01:58.792 --> 02:00.834
[yells]

02:00.834 --> 02:02.750
[grunting]

02:05.083 --> 02:07.166
Strike this!
Hey!

02:07.166 --> 02:08.750
[yells]
Good save.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.208
Thanks, Double-M.
[pants]

02:10.208 --> 02:11.709
Now just keep me covered.

02:14.959 --> 02:17.125
[Ms. Marvel]
Gotcha!
Oh, no, you don't!

02:17.125 --> 02:20.667
[grunting]

02:20.667 --> 02:23.208
Ugh! That's just unfair.

02:23.208 --> 02:27.375
Web diversion assist
into web-ball throw!
[grunts]

02:29.125 --> 02:32.375
[huffs]
I'm done with this.

02:32.375 --> 02:34.709
Slingshot, now!

02:34.709 --> 02:38.792
Hi-yaaah!

02:38.792 --> 02:42.000
Flying squirrel!
Huh?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.333
[both grunt]

02:47.250 --> 02:49.792
[grunts]
Of course I get away
from S.H.I.E.L.D.

02:49.792 --> 02:53.750
only to get caught by a pair
of nobodies who aren't even
interested in the truth!

02:53.750 --> 02:56.375
We know the truth.
You were supposed
to be a hero,

02:56.375 --> 02:57.792
and instead,
you took someone's life.

02:57.792 --> 03:00.333
That isn't what happened!
[grunts]

03:00.333 --> 03:03.333
But everyone's so caught up
in dishing out punishment,

03:03.333 --> 03:07.208
they never stopped to ask
if I was actually guilty.

03:07.208 --> 03:09.458
[sighs]
Why would they?

03:09.458 --> 03:11.834
I'm just another stupid kid.

03:11.834 --> 03:13.709
No one cares.
What do you mean?

03:13.709 --> 03:17.917
[grunts]
I mean, I didn't hurt anyone,
let alone him!

03:17.917 --> 03:19.917
For real!

03:19.917 --> 03:23.125
Okay.
Tell your story, Ghosty.

03:23.125 --> 03:25.417
If we believe you,
we'll let you go.

03:25.417 --> 03:28.375
If we don't...
[whistles]

03:28.375 --> 03:30.375
[squirrels chittering]

03:34.041 --> 03:38.917
Well, let's just say
you get to find out
what a pistachio feels like!

03:38.917 --> 03:40.458
Oh, please don't.
