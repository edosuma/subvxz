Maltese MacGuffin!

00:27.143 --> 00:29.038
Lost during Netherworld War II,

00:29.115 --> 00:31.560
this ephemeral heirloom
is so rare

00:31.637 --> 00:34.427
that no one has ever
laid eyes upon it.

Whoa. So what
is it exactly?

00:36.789 --> 00:39.701
The stuff dreams are made of.

00:40.239 --> 00:42.435
No, but, like,
is it a statue or...

00:43.801 --> 00:44.951
Come on, Uncle Donald!

00:45.028 --> 00:46.497
You can fix the houseboat

00:53.345 --> 00:54.896
Seven days!

00:58.161 --> 01:00.270
I should get started.

01:01.105 --> 01:02.905
No rush!

01:03.104 --> 01:05.123
Granny?
You're coming too?!

01:05.200 --> 01:07.387
I have 987 vacation days
saved up,

01:07.464 --> 01:10.388
and Monacrow's Blackwater
Beaches are legendary.

It's high time
I "wilded out"

01:12.309 --> 01:15.693

Only seat I could find.

03:09.742 --> 03:10.829
Seatbelts?

03:10.907 --> 03:12.383
Oh. Um...

03:13.164 --> 03:16.079
When we crash, it can be
used as a floatation device!

03:16.156 --> 03:17.189
<i>When</i> we crash?

03:17.266 --> 03:19.142
Long time since
you've been in the field,

03:19.219 --> 03:21.080
eh, Agent 22?

03:21.157 --> 03:23.719
And this plane would have been
dangerously outdated even then.

03:23.796 --> 03:26.493
I'm counting 1, 2, 3,
14 safety violations.

03:26.570 --> 03:27.509
Aw, come on.

03:27.586 --> 03:30.070
Every time
the Sun Chaser goes down,

03:30.147 --> 03:33.009
she always gets
right back up in the air.

03:33.086 --> 03:34.244
"Every time"?

03:34.321 --> 03:35.931
I allow the children
to travel with you

03:36.008 --> 03:37.993
because I assume
you're keeping them safe.

03:38.070 --> 03:39.040
Ach, jings!

03:39.117 --> 03:41.736
Launchpad, give the old bird
a tour of the old bird

03:41.813 --> 03:43.366
to show her there's
nothing to worry about.

03:43.443 --> 03:45.452
I'll take
the wheel-stick thingie.

03:45.529 --> 03:48.194
Sorry, when did you learn
to fly a massive cargo plane?

03:48.271 --> 03:50.671
Please,
I'm Scrooge McDuck.

03:50.748 --> 03:53.623
If Launchpad can do it,
how hard can it be?

03:53.700 --> 03:56.249
Not very!
Our tour starts down

03:56.326 --> 03:57.696
at the tummy
of the plane.

03:57.773 --> 03:59.857
Let me know if this
gets too technical.

04:06.272 --> 04:09.100
I sweetalked Quackfaster down
at Scrooge's secret archives.

04:09.177 --> 04:10.199
That lady is nuts!

04:10.276 --> 04:11.679
And I got her
to give us this.

04:11.756 --> 04:13.342
Start at the corners
and work inward.

04:13.419 --> 04:16.366
No, Huey. Each mysterious
piece holds a secret.

04:16.442 --> 04:18.522
Listen closely, and they'll
tell you where they go.

04:18.599 --> 04:19.546
It goes there.

04:19.623 --> 04:20.921
Okay. So what do we got?

04:20.998 --> 04:23.474
The documents shredded
on the week we were born.

04:23.551 --> 04:25.678
According to the note
we found in Castle McDuck,

04:25.755 --> 04:27.498
that date is connected to...

04:27.575 --> 04:29.304
The Spear of Selene.

04:29.381 --> 04:32.616
The mysterious unknown thing
your mom took from Scrooge.

04:32.693 --> 04:34.272
Somewhere in these pieces

04:34.349 --> 04:36.585
are the answers Scrooge
doesn't want us to find.

04:36.662 --> 04:38.349
What is
the Spear of Selene?

04:38.426 --> 04:41.089
Why didn't Scrooge
and Donald talk for years?

04:41.166 --> 04:43.599
What happened to our mom?

04:43.974 --> 04:47.561
Nothing can stop us n...
Oh! Oh, come on!

04:47.638 --> 04:48.772
Where's the last piece?!

04:48.849 --> 04:50.522
It's gotta be here
somewhere.

04:51.630 --> 04:52.841
There!

04:53.593 --> 04:56.718
Aha!
Nothing can stop us...

04:56.795 --> 04:58.724
- Get the thing, get the thing!
- Stop milking the moment!

05:01.215 --> 05:02.386
Whoa!

05:02.623 --> 05:04.099
Where'd it go?!

05:04.670 --> 05:06.711
What just happened?
Where are the children?

05:06.788 --> 05:09.014
Quick! If they find out we're
researching his darkest secret,

05:09.091 --> 05:11.646
Scrooge'll shut down
our investigation for good!

05:14.653 --> 05:17.513
- Are you children all right?
- Inconspicuous whistling.

05:17.590 --> 05:19.304
Just
a casual whistle.

05:20.739 --> 05:23.665
Oh! You anti-aeronautical
patchwork contraption!

05:23.742 --> 05:25.133
Will you fly already!

05:25.210 --> 05:26.216
McDuck!

05:26.294 --> 05:28.460
I leave you alone
for two minutes,

05:28.537 --> 05:30.092
and you crash the plane!

05:30.169 --> 05:34.005
If we crashed, then
why are we still in the air?

05:38.793 --> 05:40.470
Of all
the irresponsible...

05:40.547 --> 05:42.204
Not even a real crash.

05:42.281 --> 05:44.428
Oh, quit your haverin'.

05:44.505 --> 05:47.601
It's just a teeny
10,000-meter speed bump.

05:47.678 --> 05:48.907
I'll have us
safely on the trail

05:48.984 --> 05:50.670
of the Maltese MacGuffin
by morning,

05:50.747 --> 05:52.961
or my name isn't
Scrooge Mc... Waah!

05:53.038 --> 05:54.475
Aaaahhhh!

05:56.683 --> 05:57.970
Whoa-oh-oh!

05:58.047 --> 05:59.560
Aaaah!

06:00.094 --> 06:01.388
Noo!

06:06.022 --> 06:07.194
Wha... oh!

06:07.311 --> 06:09.429
And you've blown out
an engine.

06:09.506 --> 06:12.474
Oh, it happens all the time.
Right, Launchpad?

06:12.551 --> 06:16.414
Yes. But usually I crash,
like, two seconds later.

06:16.491 --> 06:18.788
We have to get out and
figure out how to get down.

06:18.865 --> 06:20.741
And pass up the adventure
of a lifetime?!

06:20.818 --> 06:22.685
And risk all our lives?!

06:22.889 --> 06:24.655
Ah, you're safe as houses!

06:24.732 --> 06:25.984
This is nothing!

06:26.061 --> 06:27.600
The plane
could be on fire.

06:27.677 --> 06:28.874
Or we could be on fire.

06:28.951 --> 06:30.100
Or this could be
a volcano!

06:30.177 --> 06:31.788
Everything could be on fire!

06:31.865 --> 06:33.757
This is a flagrant breach
of training, protocol,

06:33.834 --> 06:35.406
and just basic
safety precautions!

06:35.483 --> 06:36.492
Is this
what you're doing

06:36.569 --> 06:38.171
when you take the family
on road trips?

06:38.248 --> 06:39.858
- Achh, you're overreacting.
- I have no idea why you thought

06:39.935 --> 06:41.389
- this was a good idea.
-You're a hysteric!

06:41.466 --> 06:44.491
We seem to have hit
some, um, turbulence

06:44.568 --> 06:45.872
in the cockpit here.

06:45.949 --> 06:47.093
Everything's fine.

06:47.170 --> 06:49.491
<i>Please enjoy
our in-flight entertainment.</i>

06:50.889 --> 06:52.092
Now what?

06:52.474 --> 06:54.170
Now that!

06:54.625 --> 06:55.872
We'll use the jeep's engine

06:55.949 --> 06:57.697
to jumpstart
the Sun Chaser's propeller,

06:57.774 --> 06:58.860
and we'll be on our way.

06:58.937 --> 07:00.087
What could be safer?

07:00.164 --> 07:01.101
Calling for help.

07:01.178 --> 07:02.552
Climbing down on our own.

07:02.629 --> 07:04.820
Not starting a car
inside of a plane!

07:04.897 --> 07:06.935
We've got to get that piece
without anyone noticing.

07:07.012 --> 07:09.060
We'll need
some kind of distraction.

07:11.321 --> 07:13.493
Fine. Follow my lead.

07:22.642 --> 07:25.969
Ha! All set up here,
Mr. McDee!

07:26.814 --> 07:28.447
See here, Bentina.

07:28.524 --> 07:30.971
I have taken these children
on countless adventures,

07:31.048 --> 07:33.900
and they have never once had cause
to worry about their safety.

07:33.977 --> 07:37.391
Uncle Scrooge? We're
worried about our safety.

07:37.514 --> 07:40.565
Now, Louie, I have always
looked out for you.

07:40.642 --> 07:44.736
Why worry now at such a potentially
embarrassing moment for me?

07:44.813 --> 07:47.174
I know we've been
in tough spots before,

07:47.251 --> 07:49.463
but this one seems
really tough.

07:49.540 --> 07:51.244
He's right.
Given the altitude,

07:51.321 --> 07:52.813
the condition of the plane,
and the weather patterns,

07:52.890 --> 07:54.908
we have a 1 in 17 million
chance of surviving.

07:54.985 --> 07:56.010
Wait, really?!

07:56.087 --> 07:58.015
I-I mean, yeah! Scaaary!

07:58.092 --> 07:59.689
And usually
on our expeditions,

07:59.766 --> 08:02.530
there's some kind of curse
or villain that you can outwit.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.594
But you can't outwit gravity.

08:04.671 --> 08:07.290
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that...
That's right!

08:07.367 --> 08:09.156
We're all gonna die!

08:09.484 --> 08:10.931
We're worried
about our safety!

08:11.008 --> 08:12.688
We gotta go!
Now now now!

08:12.765 --> 08:14.224
- Now?
- No!

08:14.972 --> 08:16.438
Aaaaaahhhhh!

08:16.515 --> 08:17.546
No!

08:18.498 --> 08:19.865
Aah!

08:23.481 --> 08:26.240
Huh. Never crashed
a jeep in a plane before.

08:26.317 --> 08:28.220
Into a plane, sure, but...

08:31.526 --> 08:32.592
Hmm?

08:33.861 --> 08:35.553
- Ooh!
- Launchpad!

08:35.630 --> 08:37.335
You need to
counterbalance the plane!

08:37.412 --> 08:38.659
Everyone to the front!

08:39.938 --> 08:40.993
Go go go!

08:47.377 --> 08:49.395
What is in here?

08:49.472 --> 08:50.839
Nothing!

08:53.198 --> 08:54.637
Uh, Mr. McDee?

08:54.714 --> 08:57.878
Yaah! Beakley!
Secure the hatch!

09:11.866 --> 09:12.866
Yaah!

09:14.836 --> 09:15.836
Aah!

09:19.278 --> 09:20.529
Whoa!

09:26.856 --> 09:28.181
Aaah!

09:39.142 --> 09:40.520
Thanks, Mr. McDee.

09:40.597 --> 09:44.417
Nothing bad will happen while
Scrooge McDuck is around.

09:46.497 --> 09:48.404
Mr. McDuck!

09:48.545 --> 09:49.809
Kids!

09:49.886 --> 09:51.964
Mrs. Beakley!

09:52.154 --> 09:53.568
Sorry, I just thought
I could keep

09:53.645 --> 09:55.161
the blame circle going.

09:56.372 --> 09:58.498
Must you blindly
gallivant around

09:58.575 --> 10:00.004
with no clue
what you're doing?

10:00.081 --> 10:01.706
Irony.

10:01.783 --> 10:04.624
If you cannae listen,
I can't keep you safe,

10:04.701 --> 10:06.584
except, of course, I can,

10:06.661 --> 10:08.428
because I am Scrooge McDuck,

10:08.505 --> 10:10.051
and I am very good
at what I do.

10:10.128 --> 10:13.176
From here on out,
you have to stay put!

10:16.434 --> 10:18.044
- No!
- Stop!

10:25.326 --> 10:26.601
There's the missing piece!

10:26.678 --> 10:28.623
- We just have to get it!
- Nope! Nuh-uh!

10:28.700 --> 10:30.281
Nothing is getting me
out of this seat!

10:30.358 --> 10:31.568
What if the plane
catches fire

10:31.645 --> 10:32.756
and we have to evacuate?

10:35.357 --> 10:37.624
Come on! That puzzle piece
may be our best chance

10:37.701 --> 10:39.240
to find out
why Della disappeared!

10:39.317 --> 10:40.672
- Maybe.
- Beg your pardon?

10:40.749 --> 10:42.709
It's just, you said
that in the archives,

10:42.786 --> 10:44.019
and on Ithaquack, and...

10:44.096 --> 10:45.599
How can we know for sure?

10:45.676 --> 10:47.231
By grabbing the piece!

10:47.308 --> 10:49.738
Guys, this is the greatest
mystery of our lives.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.631
We can't solve it
if we're dead!

10:51.708 --> 10:53.139
We'll be fine.
Scrooge isn't going

10:53.216 --> 10:55.255
to let anything
bad happen to us.

10:56.034 --> 10:58.252
Stop moving!

10:58.339 --> 10:59.401
See?

10:59.479 --> 11:00.817
This couldn't
get any worse.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.355
<i>This is your captain.</i>

11:02.432 --> 11:05.394
<i>To take your minds off
our potentially grim fate,</i>

11:05.471 --> 11:06.777
<i>please enjoy another </i>

11:06.854 --> 11:09.293
<i>action-packed
Darkwing Duck video!</i>

11:11.019 --> 11:13.746
<i>The tape player seems to have
been damaged in the crash.</i>

11:13.823 --> 11:15.067
<i>Enjoy!</i>

11:19.783 --> 11:22.524
Here are those dirty laundry
bags you wanted, Mr. McDee.

11:22.601 --> 11:24.520
Launchpad,
these are parachutes.

11:24.597 --> 11:25.769
A pair of what now?

11:27.284 --> 11:28.698
Mr. McDuck?

11:28.775 --> 11:31.160
Mr. McDuck.
Scrooge!

11:31.237 --> 11:32.856
What?!
All I have to do

11:32.933 --> 11:34.566
is climb out onto the wing
to jumpstart

11:34.643 --> 11:35.699
the propeller myself,

11:35.776 --> 11:37.996
using these heavy parachutes
as counterbalance

11:38.073 --> 11:39.488
out the other side
of the plane.

11:39.565 --> 11:41.468
Leaving us with
no emergency equipment!

11:41.545 --> 11:44.145
Please, for the safety
of your family,

11:44.222 --> 11:46.254
admit you cannot fix this.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.603
Nonsense. Nothing bad
is going to happen to her.

11:48.681 --> 11:49.700
"Her" who?

11:49.778 --> 11:51.382
Hmm? The kids.

11:51.459 --> 11:53.188
They'll be thanking us
by the time we land.

11:53.265 --> 11:55.510
Launchpad, hand me
another parachute.

11:57.627 --> 11:59.218
Launchpad.

11:59.318 --> 12:02.760
Besides, the kids are having
the time of their lives.

12:11.980 --> 12:14.833
Ohh, I can't take this anymore!
I'm going for it!

12:15.518 --> 12:16.947
Dewey, no!

12:22.158 --> 12:24.526
<i>Junior Woodchuck Rule 18:</i>

12:24.603 --> 12:27.495
<i>every action has an equal
and opposite reaction.</i>

12:27.572 --> 12:28.919
I thought
that was Newton.

12:28.996 --> 12:30.358
Where do you think
he got it from?

12:30.435 --> 12:31.564
Science?

12:31.852 --> 12:33.924
Okay. I'll call out
the steps.

12:34.001 --> 12:35.215
- Got it?
- Got it!

12:35.292 --> 12:37.229
Nope. Bad idea.
Terrible idea.

12:37.306 --> 12:38.338
For Mom.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.132
Ready. Steady.

12:41.209 --> 12:43.058
Dewey, left. Step. Step.

12:43.135 --> 12:45.604
Huey, right.
Step. Step.

12:45.690 --> 12:47.568
Dewey, right, Huey, left.

12:53.675 --> 12:57.793
Please, we all believe you are a
very capable adventurer, all right?

12:57.870 --> 12:59.387
Stand down, 22.

12:59.464 --> 13:01.690
I am still your boss.

13:01.869 --> 13:03.167
Ooh!

13:06.555 --> 13:08.487
Launchpad! Now!

13:11.556 --> 13:13.402
The truth
about Della Duck.

13:13.479 --> 13:15.051
Nothing can stop us...

13:15.128 --> 13:16.363
<i> Look</i>
<i>at the stupid paper already!</i>

13:16.440 --> 13:18.456
- Dewey?!
- What the blazes...

13:19.147 --> 13:21.387
What have you got there?

13:21.558 --> 13:23.442
Not secrets!

13:23.519 --> 13:26.167
<i>Literally the
worst answer you could have given.</i>

13:27.214 --> 13:29.393
Give it here.

13:35.456 --> 13:36.722
No!

13:36.901 --> 13:39.105
Yah! Unh!

13:40.519 --> 13:42.309
Oh! Get back here!

13:42.386 --> 13:44.210
You'll get yourself killed!

13:49.955 --> 13:51.316
Uh...

13:52.097 --> 13:55.042
Both of you! Stop speeding
through the plane!

14:00.698 --> 14:01.964
Aah!

14:08.698 --> 14:11.448
Oh! That is not what
I meant, and you know it.

14:12.713 --> 14:14.353
Leave me alone!

14:18.130 --> 14:19.964
Come back here
this instant!

14:20.041 --> 14:22.205
You three!
Counterbalance the weight!

14:29.517 --> 14:31.347
I'm trying
to save your life!

14:31.424 --> 14:35.119
Now come back here,
or I will end it, young man!

14:35.196 --> 14:37.580
No! So close!

14:42.964 --> 14:44.455
Unh!

14:44.532 --> 14:45.532
Uh! Aah!

14:47.018 --> 14:48.218
Yaah!

15:06.339 --> 15:07.355
Oh, no.

15:07.433 --> 15:11.004
Oh, children.
What have you been up to?

15:11.081 --> 15:12.087
Mmm.

15:12.226 --> 15:13.517
Huh?

15:21.769 --> 15:23.439
Aah!

15:30.078 --> 15:31.135
Waah!

15:31.213 --> 15:32.176
Dewey!

15:32.253 --> 15:33.382
No!

15:35.416 --> 15:36.830
Lad!

15:44.306 --> 15:46.317
Lad!
Give me your hand!

15:46.394 --> 15:48.532
Ahh...

15:52.800 --> 15:54.659
No. Not again.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.096
<i>Dewey, this is crazy!</i>

15:56.173 --> 15:57.963
<i>The mystery's
not worth it!</i>

15:58.040 --> 16:00.804
<i>I-I-I get it,
but you can't give up the rest of us</i>

16:00.881 --> 16:02.920
<i>to find the one person
we lost!</i>

16:03.037 --> 16:05.669
Dewey, the Darkwing Duck
video is still running.

16:05.746 --> 16:07.757
Do you want me to pause it
until you get back?

16:07.834 --> 16:11.077
- <i>Gimme that!</i>
- Dewey, our family is amazing!

16:11.154 --> 16:13.091
<i>We're enough. Let it go!</i>

16:13.168 --> 16:14.272
Unh!

16:25.666 --> 16:28.608
Ah, no!

16:37.078 --> 16:40.978
Please, I... I can't
keep you safe, all right?!

16:41.092 --> 16:43.716
How can I get you
to listen to me?!

16:48.262 --> 16:51.521
Tell me about
the Spear of Selene!

17:11.349 --> 17:13.886
It was just before
you were hatched.

17:13.963 --> 17:15.843
Your mother,
your Uncle Donald,

17:15.920 --> 17:19.757
<i>and I had been going on
amazing adventures for years,</i>

17:19.834 --> 17:21.560
<i>and things were grand.</i>

17:21.637 --> 17:25.601
<i>Except we'd been
just about everywhere.</i>

17:26.137 --> 17:29.194
Ever the aviator,
your mother devised a plan

17:29.271 --> 17:32.851
to explore the greatest
uncharted territory of all:

17:32.942 --> 17:35.005
outer space!

17:36.459 --> 17:38.332
<i>Della had already been
all over the earth.</i>

17:38.409 --> 17:42.005
<i>She wanted to give
you boys the stars.</i>

17:42.105 --> 17:44.166
<i>Donald thought
it was too risky,</i>

17:44.243 --> 17:46.677
<i>especially with you three
on the way.</i>

17:46.754 --> 17:49.482
<i>So I did
the only logical thing:</i>

17:49.584 --> 17:51.444
<i>I built the rocket
and didn't tell Donald...</i>

17:51.521 --> 17:52.621
<i>or anyone.</i>

17:52.698 --> 17:54.515
<i>It was meant
to be a surprise</i>

17:54.592 --> 17:57.068
<i>for Della
to celebrate your birth.</i>

17:57.324 --> 17:59.120
<i>But your mother
was always good</i>

17:59.197 --> 18:01.070
<i>at sniffing out surprises.</i>

18:01.147 --> 18:02.546
<i>She found the rocket</i>

18:02.623 --> 18:05.857
<i>and decided to go for
a little test run in orbit.</i>

18:05.986 --> 18:09.742
<i>Neither of us could have
predicted that cosmic storm.</i>

18:09.819 --> 18:13.077
<i>But we both knew a little pangalactic
precipitation wouldn't stop her.</i>

18:13.154 --> 18:15.913
<i>After all,
she was Della Duck!</i>

18:15.990 --> 18:18.660
<i>Curse me kilts,
was that girl stubborn!</i>

18:18.737 --> 18:20.233
<i>I tried to talk her
through it,</i>

18:20.310 --> 18:22.585
<i>thought if anyone could
make it, it was her.</i>

18:22.662 --> 18:25.529
<i>Until that very last bolt.</i>

18:25.895 --> 18:28.258
<i>I couldn't keep her safe.</i>

18:28.335 --> 18:30.530
<i>The rocket and your mother</i>

18:30.607 --> 18:34.464
<i>were lost
to the inky abyss of space.</i>

18:34.755 --> 18:38.159
Your Uncle Donald
and I never spoke again.

18:38.539 --> 18:42.015
Until you three
showed up on my doorstep.

18:47.105 --> 18:50.028
Cool. So you're
the reason our mom is gone.

18:50.105 --> 18:51.543
What? No, I...

18:53.176 --> 18:54.480
Um, guys?

18:54.558 --> 18:57.028
You built her
a crazy-dangerous super-rocket!

18:57.105 --> 18:58.435
Which she stole early!

18:58.512 --> 19:01.481
Then you encouraged her to keep
flying through a cosmic storm?!

19:01.558 --> 19:02.706
You could have
called her down!

19:02.783 --> 19:03.909
There were
too many variables!

19:03.986 --> 19:05.815
Now, boys,
you don't know...

19:05.892 --> 19:08.098
And you're the richest duck
in the world!

19:08.175 --> 19:10.282
Why didn't you send up
more ships to look for her?!

19:10.359 --> 19:11.965
I spared no expense!

19:12.042 --> 19:14.345
Yeah, right. Cheap old
Scrooge probably bailed

19:14.422 --> 19:16.529
as soon as it put a dent
in his Money Bin.

19:18.250 --> 19:19.808
Um, guys?

19:20.074 --> 19:21.340
Take it easy, Dewey.

19:21.417 --> 19:22.793
He may have a point.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.571
Even if gifting
an experimental rocket

19:24.648 --> 19:26.746
to a mother of three
was clearly a terrible idea!

19:26.823 --> 19:27.982
This is a family matter.

19:28.059 --> 19:29.582
You are not family!

19:29.659 --> 19:30.786
See here, McDuck.

19:30.863 --> 19:33.963
You will not speak
to my granddaughter that way.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.142
You will not speak
to me that way!

19:36.219 --> 19:37.229
None of you!

19:37.306 --> 19:38.916
After everything
I do for you,

19:38.993 --> 19:41.086
you're all nothing
but trouble!

19:41.163 --> 19:42.216
Guys!

19:42.496 --> 19:44.087
This is
your captain speaking!

19:44.164 --> 19:45.319
We are falling!

19:45.396 --> 19:46.561
- Wait, what?!
- What?!

19:46.638 --> 19:49.408
Aaaaaaaahhh!

19:55.362 --> 19:58.104
Huh. That was weird.

20:00.334 --> 20:02.760
Phew! There we go!

20:12.901 --> 20:14.534
Back so soon?

20:14.611 --> 20:18.541
Well, ta-da!
She's all done!

20:20.221 --> 20:22.832
Uhh. What happened to you?

20:22.909 --> 20:25.144
We know about
the Spear of Selene.

20:25.299 --> 20:26.831
Oh.

20:27.534 --> 20:29.633
Let's go back
to the marina.

20:29.710 --> 20:30.956
Huh? Uh!

20:31.033 --> 20:32.284
Ohh!

20:35.432 --> 20:37.941
Isn't he even going
to say goodbye?

20:38.018 --> 20:39.894
We're taking
those vacation days.

20:39.971 --> 20:42.539
If that's all right
with you, sir.

20:42.710 --> 20:44.101
Fine.

20:45.251 --> 20:47.521
Well, you've successfully
pushed your family

20:47.598 --> 20:50.407
and everyone who cared
about you away. Again.

20:50.484 --> 20:52.211
I hope you're happy.

21:23.397 --> 21:25.834
<i> You're the richest duck</i>
<i>in the world!</i>

21:25.911 --> 21:29.393
<i>Why didn't you send up

21:29.470 --> 21:32.950
<i>Then you encouraged her to
