knocking on some doors,

07:42.260 --> 07:43.680

throw you off your game.

08:32.905 --> 08:34.066
No, you thought that if you told me,

08:34.067 --> 08:36.174
I would've suggested that you
knock on the door yourself.

08:36.176 --> 08:37.610
I knew you'd say that.

08:37.611 --> 08:39.330
Well, no, you didn't,
because you didn't give me

08:39.331 --> 08:41.212
- the opportunity to say it.
- Fine.

08:41.214 --> 08:43.215
Look, you trust me to have your back

08:43.216 --> 08:45.384
when we go up against monsters.

08:45.385 --> 08:47.920
I hope you know you can trust me
with what's going on in here.

08:47.921 --> 08:49.588
Oh, I know. I...

08:49.589 --> 08:51.023
I do know that.

08:51.024 --> 08:52.758
It's just, knowing and doing

08:52.759 --> 08:54.960
are two different things.

08:54.961 --> 08:57.363
We're both very new at this.

08:57.364 --> 08:59.531
We're doing our best, right?

08:59.532 --> 09:01.867

09:01.868 --> 09:03.569

on the door yourself.

09:03.570 --> 09:05.971

09:17.050 --> 09:18.817
We just bought that lumber this morning.

09:18.818 --> 09:20.486

this is child's play.

09:20.487 --> 09:23.222
And time is of the essence.

09:23.223 --> 09:25.224
Yeah, according to accounts I dug up

09:25.225 --> 09:27.593
from the spiritualist
movement of the 1850s,

09:27.594 --> 09:29.762
we need to take advantage
of a planetary syzygy.

09:29.763 --> 09:31.564
Syzygy.

09:31.565 --> 09:32.388
A word I used to win

09:32.389 --> 09:34.466
perhaps the finest round
of Scrabble I ever played.

09:40.507 --> 09:42.241
a <i> Lion, Witch and Wardrobe</i> thing?

09:42.242 --> 09:43.676
CRANE: Actually, more of a

09:43.677 --> 09:46.578
"locate the lieutenant
in oblivion" kind of thing.

09:46.579 --> 09:48.447
This is a spirit cabinet,

09:48.448 --> 09:51.250
meant to enable astral projection.

09:51.251 --> 09:54.286
You enter a fugue state,
and your spirit is free

09:54.287 --> 09:55.955
to travel across different
planes of reality.

09:55.956 --> 09:57.323
Miss Jenny believes it may be

09:57.324 --> 09:59.491
a way to find the lieutenant in the void

09:59.492 --> 10:03.028

10:14.207 --> 10:17.009
this is my father's.

10:19.613 --> 10:20.980
Don't ask.

Well...

10:23.717 --> 10:25.184
No, wait.

10:28.288 --> 10:30.823
Abbie sacrificed herself to save me.

No, Miss Jenny.

10:32.726 --> 10:36.462
Your familial bond notwithstanding,

10:36.463 --> 10:39.365
you yourself told me that our
shared connection as Witnesses

10:39.366 --> 10:42.267
means I am the lieutenant's best chance.

14:22.864 --> 14:24.331
Crane would head back to the archives,

14:35.643 --> 14:37.678
Not any history you think
you'd know; it'd be like,

14:37.679 --> 14:39.379
"George Washington was a zombie."

14:39.380 --> 14:41.715
"Ben Franklin had a demon
key to purgatory."

14:41.716 --> 14:43.317
And, what, Jefferson was a hologram?

14:43.318 --> 14:44.551
He told you about that?

14:44.552 --> 14:47.038
Forget it. Moving on.

14:47.039 --> 14:49.456
You said Abbie profiled creatures, right?

14:49.457 --> 14:50.958
And that's not a bad idea.

14:50.959 --> 14:52.826
But the obvious question is:
how did it wake up,

14:52.827 --> 14:53.894
and how do we stop it?

14:53.895 --> 14:55.996
Stone Manor, stone creature.

14:55.997 --> 14:57.364
Finding out who built the tower and when

14:57.365 --> 14:58.799
might give us some clues.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.200
We can get the date and place of origin

15:00.201 --> 15:01.401
off the cornerstone.

15:04.505 --> 15:07.908
This tower was most likely once
part of the Cathedral de Rouen.

15:07.909 --> 15:09.910
And you know that how?

15:09.911 --> 15:11.545
My parents were archaeologists.

15:11.546 --> 15:13.413
For a while, I considered
going into the field.

15:13.414 --> 15:15.882
Saint-Cyr granite.

15:15.883 --> 15:17.317
Mostly used by French craftsmen.

15:17.318 --> 15:19.186
Hand-carved in the baroque style.

15:19.187 --> 15:20.587
So 17th century.

15:20.588 --> 15:22.856
You had me at French craftsmen.

15:24.158 --> 15:26.860
Reynolds said this place was
historic; he wasn't kidding.

15:26.861 --> 15:29.162
This tower was relocated
from Europe, stone by stone.

15:29.163 --> 15:30.897
And maybe the Gargoyle came with it.

15:30.898 --> 15:33.267
We can get more information
in the cathedral's library.

15:33.268 --> 15:35.936
Let's start there.

15:41.175 --> 15:43.277
Your turn.

15:43.278 --> 15:45.412
Oh, really? Call it a night?

15:45.413 --> 15:48.215
In a place where there is no night?

15:52.086 --> 15:54.121
(chuckles)

15:56.791 --> 15:58.992
That's check and mate, Crane.

16:00.962 --> 16:03.196
Better luck next time.

16:03.197 --> 16:05.198
CRANE: Lieutenant...

16:05.199 --> 16:06.933
Lieutenant.

16:10.538 --> 16:12.139
Crane?

16:14.776 --> 16:16.409
Crane?

16:18.079 --> 16:20.447
CRANE: Lieutenant.

16:21.716 --> 16:23.150
Crane!

16:23.151 --> 16:25.352
(panting)

16:29.424 --> 16:31.425
All in your head.

16:31.426 --> 16:33.427
It is all in your head, Abbie.

16:33.428 --> 16:35.028
Okay.

16:36.564 --> 16:38.165
Your move.

16:39.834 --> 16:43.036
CRANE: Queen to knight four, Lieutenant.

16:45.640 --> 16:49.276
Queen-knight defense.

16:51.846 --> 16:53.814
What is this?

16:53.815 --> 16:55.415
CRANE: I'm close.

16:55.416 --> 16:58.485
I need help for the last
bit of the journey.

16:59.787 --> 17:01.622
What do I do?

17:01.623 --> 17:04.625
Our bond, hold it in your mind.

17:04.626 --> 17:06.760
Our partnership.

17:06.761 --> 17:11.198
(whispers): Please be real,
please be real, please be real.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.969
Please let this be real.

17:17.704 --> 17:21.907
Oh, it is a relief to find you
hale and hearty, Lieutenant.

17:23.144 --> 17:25.479
I knew you were alive.

17:34.322 --> 17:38.658
I'm afraid I am here
in spirit form only.

17:40.461 --> 17:43.297
An astral projection.

17:43.298 --> 17:45.132
It was Miss Jenny's idea.

17:45.133 --> 17:47.200
With the assistance of Master Corbin.

17:47.201 --> 17:51.538
We never surrendered hope, Lieutenant.

17:51.539 --> 17:53.740
Over the past few weeks,
we've searched high and low.

17:53.741 --> 17:55.175
"Weeks"?

17:55.176 --> 17:57.577
I've been here ten months, Crane.

18:10.491 --> 18:12.225
(sighs)

18:13.261 --> 18:15.696
Is everything all right, my love?

18:15.697 --> 18:17.698
(sighs)

18:17.699 --> 18:20.534
The effort it took to move our home.

18:20.535 --> 18:22.503
(sighs)

18:22.504 --> 18:26.106
These paltry trifles I
am reduced to summoning.

18:26.107 --> 18:28.342
Your power will return.

18:28.343 --> 18:30.744
And with it, your omnipotence.

18:30.745 --> 18:32.412
The Eye

18:32.413 --> 18:35.582
was in my grasp.

18:35.583 --> 18:39.586
Then that Witness took it...

18:39.587 --> 18:42.289
and fled into the Catacombs.

18:44.192 --> 18:48.328
And I cannot follow to
retrieve what is mine.

18:49.631 --> 18:52.633
Clearly I cannot use the same method

18:52.634 --> 18:55.636
by which I brought you forth.

18:55.637 --> 18:58.305
But there may be another route.

19:05.380 --> 19:10.884
The Witness has found a path
to reach his other half

19:10.885 --> 19:14.254
and in turn provided me a way

19:14.255 --> 19:16.924
to retrieve what she took from you.

19:16.925 --> 19:20.160
Excellent.

19:20.161 --> 19:23.664
Once the Eye is in my hands,

19:23.665 --> 19:27.534
we shall make those mortals
pay for what they've done.

19:34.489 --> 19:35.306
The sun has not

19:35.307 --> 19:36.913
set, it has not moved in the sky

19:36.914 --> 19:38.881
since I arrived here.
Once my phone died,

19:38.882 --> 19:41.317
I had no way of telling time,

19:41.318 --> 19:43.419
so... (chuckles)

19:45.055 --> 19:47.423
Takes roughly 12 hours
for the sand to pour out.

19:47.424 --> 19:49.258
Two sleeve-fulls equals a day.

19:49.259 --> 19:52.561
304. Ten months.

19:52.562 --> 19:55.297
- What did you do for sustenance?
- Strange.

19:55.298 --> 19:59.401
It's like I don't need
to eat, drink or sleep.

19:59.402 --> 20:01.437
Problem isn't hunger.

20:01.438 --> 20:03.639
It's monotony.

20:03.640 --> 20:08.010
I have, uh, spent most
of my time exploring,

20:08.011 --> 20:12.281
searching for a way out,
mapping the place best I could.

20:12.282 --> 20:15.818
There is powerful magic
at work here, Lieutenant.

20:18.455 --> 20:21.490
These hieroglyphs are remarkably similar

20:21.491 --> 20:25.094
to the Sumerian I found
on our ancient tablet.

20:25.095 --> 20:27.963
I cannot tell you how many
times I wished you were here

20:27.964 --> 20:29.565
to help me decipher them.

20:31.968 --> 20:35.371
Thank you, Crane.

20:35.372 --> 20:37.606
For never giving up on me.

20:37.607 --> 20:42.445
I only did as I knew you would
had our roles been reversed.

20:42.446 --> 20:44.847
I just wish I could have come sooner.

20:44.848 --> 20:47.349
Funny thing is it's like you've
been here the whole time.

20:47.350 --> 20:50.186
I talk to you, Crane.

20:50.187 --> 20:52.388
Not <i> you</i> you, of course, but, you know,

20:52.389 --> 20:54.857
I know what you would say
and how you would say it,

20:54.858 --> 20:57.293
and it's nice to have someone
to talk to, play chess with.

20:57.294 --> 20:59.295
Do not worry, I haven't
completely lost it.

20:59.296 --> 21:01.230
Not yet anyway.

21:05.135 --> 21:07.536
JENNY: The French General
Lafayette's will stipulated

21:07.537 --> 21:10.372
his papers remain here under
the sign of the cross.

21:10.373 --> 21:12.007
Nothing about Gargoyles?

21:12.008 --> 21:13.709
It's almost conspicuous in its absence.

21:13.710 --> 21:15.644
It's a dead end.

21:15.645 --> 21:17.213
Hold on.

21:17.214 --> 21:19.315
This guy was a marquis, right?

21:19.316 --> 21:21.317
Educated at the finest universities.

21:21.318 --> 21:22.959
Not that my French is perfect,

21:22.960 --> 21:25.054
but there are some odd word choices here

21:25.055 --> 21:27.089
and verbs conjugated incorrectly.

21:27.090 --> 21:29.325
- Let me see that.
- You don't speak French.

21:29.326 --> 21:32.328
Uh, no, but I can spot a pattern.

21:32.329 --> 21:34.430
So I'll just take a look.

21:34.431 --> 21:36.131
Thanks.

21:37.734 --> 21:38.901
Here.

21:38.902 --> 21:41.403
It's subtle, but look. This was written

21:41.404 --> 21:43.372
in two slightly different
tones of blue ink.

21:43.373 --> 21:45.307
It's a cipher.

21:46.276 --> 21:48.744
JENNY: There's another narrative here,

21:48.745 --> 21:50.279
hidden right inside the correspondence.

21:50.280 --> 21:51.514
Here, I can translate it.

21:51.515 --> 21:53.682
"I had arranged to meet

21:53.683 --> 21:56.419
"my contact with the colonial forces

21:56.420 --> 22:00.289
"at a courtyard near the
Rouen Bell Tower...

22:00.290 --> 22:04.693
<i>"Betsy Ross, General
Washington's attaché...</i>

22:04.694 --> 22:06.462
<i>"where we were to pledge our commitment</i>

22:06.463 --> 22:09.198
<i>"to the Americans in their
battle for independence.</i>

22:09.199 --> 22:12.868
<i>"But the British had unleashed
a creature out of myth</i>

22:12.869 --> 22:14.203
<i>"to end our new alliance.</i>

22:14.204 --> 22:16.272
<i>"La Gargouille,</i>

22:16.273 --> 22:19.241
"an evil beast of living stone,

22:19.242 --> 22:21.410
"hunted us through the
grounds of the cathedral.

22:21.411 --> 22:24.947
<i>His sole purpose was to stop
us before we succeeded."</i>

22:24.948 --> 22:26.482
(growling)

22:27.284 --> 22:29.418
(roars)

22:29.419 --> 22:31.720
This way, quickly!

22:31.721 --> 22:33.489
(roars)

22:33.490 --> 22:35.624
SOPHIE: <i>Wait, that's it?</i>

22:35.625 --> 22:36.892
What happened to Lafayette?

22:36.893 --> 22:38.260
Betsy Ross?

22:38.261 --> 22:41.097
That's all there is.

22:41.098 --> 22:43.432
JOE: Crane usually fills in the rest.

22:43.433 --> 22:45.434
Well, her mission must have succeeded,

22:45.435 --> 22:47.770
despite General Howe
siccing a monster on them.

22:47.771 --> 22:49.672
Lafayette and the French forces

22:49.673 --> 22:51.941
joined the Colonials
against the British.

22:51.942 --> 22:53.776
They must've found a way to turn
the creature back to stone.

22:53.777 --> 22:55.478
So how do we do the same?

22:55.479 --> 22:57.680
Well, Abbie and Crane

22:57.681 --> 22:59.281
usually take a lesson from the past

22:59.282 --> 23:02.451
and use it to find clues
to help with the present.

23:02.452 --> 23:05.021
That's great, but they aren't
here right now; we are.

23:05.022 --> 23:07.702
Yeah, and we're working through it.

23:08.325 --> 23:10.893
Okay, I'm just gonna...

23:12.129 --> 23:13.262
(sighs)

23:13.263 --> 23:14.363
Come on, just try...

23:14.364 --> 23:16.565
- Joe, I'm fine.
- Okay.

23:18.935 --> 23:21.470
These tell a story

23:21.471 --> 23:24.273
of a powerful deity whose name is

23:24.274 --> 23:25.808
forever hidden.

23:25.809 --> 23:27.710
I think we know the one.

23:27.711 --> 23:29.712
It says

23:29.713 --> 23:33.149
he will appear to his followers
in this very temple.

23:33.150 --> 23:34.884
"His power incarnate,

23:34.885 --> 23:38.387
"flowing from the Eye upon his staff,

23:38.388 --> 23:41.390
and opening a pathway between worlds."

23:41.391 --> 23:43.192
The <i> Eye</i> of Providence.

23:43.193 --> 23:45.094
That's how I got here.

23:47.364 --> 23:49.298
CRANE: Right. There must be a way

23:49.299 --> 23:52.368
to revive it, so that we can use
it to get back to our world.

23:52.369 --> 23:53.636
If I bring it back, I'll be giving

23:53.637 --> 23:55.037
the Hidden One what he wants.

23:56.406 --> 23:57.973
Wait, wait, wait.

23:57.974 --> 23:59.875
This cutlass.

23:59.876 --> 24:02.144
I've seen this cutlass before.

24:02.145 --> 24:04.480
- Impossible. I found it here.
- No.

24:04.481 --> 24:06.982
There's no mistaking it, Lieutenant.

24:06.983 --> 24:09.251
This belonged to Betsy Ross.

24:12.689 --> 24:15.369
PANDORA: Nothing left but a ruin.

24:17.561 --> 24:20.196
Shame what's become of this place.

24:22.065 --> 24:24.745
In its day, it was glorious.

24:26.870 --> 24:29.839
Sorry, dearest. This is my astral form.

24:29.840 --> 24:32.942
Like your fellow Witness,
I have projected it here.

24:32.943 --> 24:34.443
No need for a spirit cabinet though

24:34.444 --> 24:36.045
when your husband is a god.

24:36.046 --> 24:38.180
He's a monster.

24:38.181 --> 24:40.883
And you are a very close second.

24:40.884 --> 24:41.951
What do you want?

24:41.952 --> 24:43.753
Nothing from you.

24:43.754 --> 24:46.856
You're searching for a way out, and yes,

24:46.857 --> 24:48.657
the Eye is the key.

24:50.060 --> 24:52.094
I can show you how,

24:52.095 --> 24:54.430
for a price.

24:54.431 --> 24:56.632
Bring us

24:56.633 --> 25:00.002
the Eye, Witness,
and you can go back home.

25:03.073 --> 25:06.075
We're not going to give it to you.

25:06.076 --> 25:10.379
There's nothing that you can do...

25:10.380 --> 25:12.381
in your astral form.

25:12.382 --> 25:14.450
You are so smart.

25:14.451 --> 25:16.318
You're too smart

25:16.319 --> 25:19.388
for your own good.

25:19.389 --> 25:23.125
No, I can't touch you.

25:24.461 --> 25:25.461
(gasps)

25:25.462 --> 25:26.595
No!

25:26.596 --> 25:28.197
But I can touch him.

25:29.900 --> 25:32.101
What have you done?

25:32.102 --> 25:34.070
I've cut you loose.

25:34.071 --> 25:35.971
Now you'll float free

25:35.972 --> 25:37.606
for all eternity.

25:39.976 --> 25:44.046
A lost and silent soul.

25:48.919 --> 25:51.921
Unless you give me what I want.

25:51.922 --> 25:54.056
Tick-tock.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.154
(roars)

26:00.879 --> 26:02.246
(engine starts)

26:02.247 --> 26:03.881
Some kind of wild animal.

26:03.882 --> 26:06.180
- Up in the tower.
- Okay, we've got it handled.

26:06.181 --> 26:07.281
Go, go.

26:07.282 --> 26:09.683
The creature. It's here.

26:09.684 --> 26:11.251
Follow my lead.

26:17.526 --> 26:19.260
There, on the ledge.

26:19.261 --> 26:21.395
(gunshots)

26:21.396 --> 26:23.063
It's on the move!

26:24.800 --> 26:26.000
Stay sharp.

26:28.403 --> 26:30.604
(growling)

26:35.310 --> 26:36.911
(roars)

26:47.222 --> 26:48.789
Hey! Here!

26:48.790 --> 26:51.058
No, wait, wait! The Abbey!
Lafayette thought

26:51.059 --> 26:52.793
the sign of the cross could
keep the creature away.

26:52.794 --> 26:55.062
Hallowed ground. It's worth a shot.

26:55.063 --> 26:56.597
Go, run! I'll cover you!

26:59.935 --> 27:00.935
JOE: Go!

27:00.936 --> 27:02.870
(roars)

27:05.340 --> 27:06.940
JENNY: Go!

27:07.743 --> 27:09.510
(growling)

27:18.587 --> 27:20.821
SOPHIE: You really think
that's gonna stop him?

27:20.822 --> 27:22.456
The Gargoyle, he can't come
onto consecrated ground.

27:22.457 --> 27:25.626
For now. That thing is still out there.

27:25.627 --> 27:26.994
Yes, but we isolated a weakness.

27:26.995 --> 27:28.254
We can go on the offensive.

27:28.255 --> 27:29.930
Okay, if hallowed ground
hurts the thing...

27:29.931 --> 27:30.776
Then we take what we can

27:30.777 --> 27:32.299
from this place and we weaponize it.

27:32.300 --> 27:34.969
Hey, holy water could work.

27:34.970 --> 27:36.971
We'll take one of the pews,
rip it up and make stakes

27:36.972 --> 27:38.639
- and pikes.
- Hold on.

27:38.640 --> 27:40.341
You want to toss water on a Gargoyle

27:40.342 --> 27:41.709
and hope it's allergic?

27:41.710 --> 27:43.444
No, I got a better idea.

27:43.445 --> 27:46.380
Okay? We... we turn it to
stone with no magic involved.

27:46.381 --> 27:48.115
The restoration crew left
their mixer out there.

27:48.116 --> 27:49.850
We can use that, too.

27:49.851 --> 27:51.652
We already have a plan.

27:52.521 --> 27:54.121
What is the issue?

27:54.122 --> 27:56.157
We are on the same side,
so why the static?

27:56.158 --> 27:57.324
JOE: Everybody just-just

27:57.325 --> 27:58.826
take a second, all right?

27:59.895 --> 28:01.128
Look, maybe we should hear her out.

28:01.129 --> 28:03.864
Are you kidding me right now?

28:03.865 --> 28:06.667
Look, I know it's been...

28:06.668 --> 28:08.602
it's been a really weird day for you.

28:08.603 --> 28:10.304
I get it, believe me.

28:10.305 --> 28:13.340
But we need to throw everything
we got at this thing.

28:16.778 --> 28:20.281
PANDORA: There is still a chance
to save your fellow Witness.

28:20.282 --> 28:23.517
I can show you how to
use the Eye to return.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.889
But you'd rather die than
give us what we need.

28:28.890 --> 28:30.491
Noble.

28:30.492 --> 28:33.828
But there are fates worse
than death, Abbie.

28:33.829 --> 28:36.730
A month has passed in the world,

28:36.731 --> 28:38.265
yet here in the Catacombs,

28:38.266 --> 28:41.235
time has flown ten times as fast.

28:41.236 --> 28:44.872
How long will you be able
to stand the solitude?

28:47.008 --> 28:50.711
There have been moments
where I thought I would go mad.

28:55.517 --> 28:59.787
And there may be a day in
the future where I do.

28:59.788 --> 29:01.989
So...

29:03.792 --> 29:07.595
...for that reason...

29:07.596 --> 29:09.797
I will do this.

29:18.940 --> 29:21.108
(grunts)

29:25.747 --> 29:28.249
No.

29:29.985 --> 29:32.053
In chess,

29:32.054 --> 29:34.588
we call that move a sacrifice.

29:36.658 --> 29:38.426
On the face,

29:38.427 --> 29:41.729
it presents a loss, but in the end,

29:41.730 --> 29:43.664
gives tactical superiority.

29:43.665 --> 29:46.534
You despicable creature.

29:49.004 --> 29:52.073
You enjoy that superiority

29:52.074 --> 29:55.709
while you rot in this
prison for all eternity!

30:07.631 --> 30:10.132
(thunder rumbling softly)

30:13.771 --> 30:14.837
Coast is clear.

30:14.838 --> 30:16.406
Give me a minute or two

30:16.407 --> 30:17.740
to get it started, all right?

30:17.741 --> 30:19.008
Roger that.

30:21.779 --> 30:23.913
It's the right plan, Jenny.

30:23.914 --> 30:25.248
I hope so.

30:25.249 --> 30:27.049
We're betting the farm on it.

30:28.185 --> 30:30.253
Joe.

30:30.254 --> 30:32.522
That thing with my dad this morning...

30:32.523 --> 30:34.290
it's not that I don't trust you.

30:34.291 --> 30:35.758
It's just that I've been

30:35.759 --> 30:38.528
keeping people at arm's
length for so long.

30:43.934 --> 30:45.601
Stick with it, okay?

30:45.602 --> 30:47.537
You try and stop me.

30:47.538 --> 30:49.505
(water sloshing)

30:49.506 --> 30:50.573
Okay.

30:56.647 --> 30:57.880
You know,

30:57.881 --> 30:59.482
I had an ex-boyfriend like that.

30:59.483 --> 31:00.516
Lots of attitude,

31:00.517 --> 31:02.985
head full of rocks.

31:12.663 --> 31:13.896
Start, start.

31:13.897 --> 31:16.599
- (engine starts)
- Ha!

31:19.870 --> 31:21.371
Hey, ugly!

31:21.372 --> 31:22.372
(growls)

31:22.373 --> 31:24.240
Over here!

31:33.017 --> 31:35.751
(roars)

31:37.688 --> 31:38.821
Come on, big guy.

31:38.822 --> 31:41.023
Just a little bit closer.

31:41.659 --> 31:43.359
(shrieks)

31:43.360 --> 31:44.594
Grab my hand!

31:47.398 --> 31:50.078
JOE: Hey!

32:09.586 --> 32:11.220
(engine stops)

32:16.794 --> 32:18.227
(cement crackles)

32:18.228 --> 32:19.862
We did good.

32:19.863 --> 32:22.599
Yeah.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.734
All of us.

32:24.735 --> 32:26.736
Yeah.

32:31.609 --> 32:33.810
♪ ♪

33:04.408 --> 33:05.808
You made your move.

33:05.809 --> 33:08.010
Live with it!

33:21.825 --> 33:24.026
CRANE (echoing): Lieutenant.

33:25.863 --> 33:27.664
Is that you, Crane?

33:27.665 --> 33:28.831
CRANE: Lieutenant.

33:28.832 --> 33:32.435
Guess it won't matter much...

33:32.436 --> 33:34.504
in the end.

33:36.307 --> 33:38.441
Broken record, Crane.

33:38.442 --> 33:39.342
What?!

33:39.343 --> 33:40.777
I meant what I said before.

33:40.778 --> 33:42.512
You're always here with me.

33:42.513 --> 33:44.814
Ever since we first met.
There's no explaining it.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.649
Two people could not be
any more different,

33:46.650 --> 33:48.485
but we work things out together.

33:48.486 --> 33:50.053
I know exactly what you would say.

33:50.054 --> 33:51.287
"Come now, Lieutenant.

33:51.288 --> 33:54.524
"If there is an eternity before us,

33:54.525 --> 33:56.826
let's face it with chin held high."

33:59.196 --> 34:01.998
You said this cutlass belongs
to Betsy Ross, Crane?

34:03.867 --> 34:06.502
"Indeed, Lieutenant.

34:06.503 --> 34:08.204
"If she left her weapon here,

34:08.205 --> 34:10.706
was she once captive here herself?"

34:11.675 --> 34:13.775
Or did she escape?

34:17.648 --> 34:19.649
There is something here.

34:19.650 --> 34:21.717
I know it.

34:26.389 --> 34:29.458
This knife was left there for a reason.

34:32.530 --> 34:34.730
What have I missed?

34:38.536 --> 34:42.071
"Something made these marks, Lieutenant."

34:43.072 --> 34:45.475
Not a blade.

34:47.344 --> 34:48.610
(gasps)

34:48.612 --> 34:50.213
A rope!

34:50.214 --> 34:53.783
The knife was used as a
stay to support the rope

34:53.784 --> 34:55.217
around the stump.

34:59.089 --> 35:01.624
And lower someone...

35:01.625 --> 35:03.826
into the well.

35:06.697 --> 35:07.730
Crane!

35:07.731 --> 35:09.532
Still there?

35:09.533 --> 35:11.293
CRANE: Lieutenant.

35:12.770 --> 35:15.171
It's you.

35:16.273 --> 35:18.474
I know you are still with me.

35:19.476 --> 35:21.911
And if this is the way out,

35:21.912 --> 35:23.713
then you come with me.

35:23.714 --> 35:26.983
You said that Jenny and you used totems

35:26.984 --> 35:28.718
to help find me.

35:28.719 --> 35:31.087
Now just use me.

35:33.090 --> 35:35.158
If I get out of here...

35:35.159 --> 35:36.459
(panting)

35:36.460 --> 35:38.194
...so will you.

35:43.267 --> 35:45.468
Stay with me, Crane.

35:58.153 --> 35:59.913
CRANE: <i>Lieutenant!</i>

36:01.590 --> 36:04.394
ABBIE: <i> Stay with me, Crane.</i> Lieutenant!

36:04.395 --> 36:06.329
ABBIE: <i>I need you.</i>

36:06.330 --> 36:08.632
CRANE: <i>Hold fast, Abigail Mills.</i>

36:08.633 --> 36:12.169
PANDORA: <i> How does that feel,
to know that you're alone now?</i>

36:12.170 --> 36:14.070
ABBIE: <i>Crane!</i>

36:14.071 --> 36:15.772
(gasps)

36:17.575 --> 36:19.776
(birds chirping)

36:23.147 --> 36:25.348
(jet engine whooshing in distance)

36:28.186 --> 36:31.388
Oh, thank God.

36:44.502 --> 36:46.403
The candle's out.

36:47.505 --> 36:49.272
He should be awake.

36:53.611 --> 36:56.246
It's the same as when we left.

36:56.247 --> 36:57.747
His body's here,

36:57.748 --> 36:59.082
but his spirit isn't.

36:59.083 --> 37:02.185
What? That makes zero sense.

37:02.186 --> 37:05.021
The candle was supposed to be
a tether. It should've...

37:05.022 --> 37:06.590
should've snapped him back.

37:06.591 --> 37:09.292
It was cut.

37:09.293 --> 37:12.028
Abbie.

37:12.029 --> 37:13.363
You.

37:13.364 --> 37:15.132
Mmm.

37:15.133 --> 37:17.134
You, your plan worked.

37:17.135 --> 37:18.135
(laughs)

37:18.136 --> 37:20.470
Crane found me.

37:20.471 --> 37:23.573
I was trapped in this place;
Pandora called it the Catacombs.

37:23.574 --> 37:24.875
Pandora was there?

37:24.876 --> 37:26.910
Crane and I were working on a way out.

37:26.911 --> 37:30.147
She appeared and cut his tether.

37:30.148 --> 37:32.115
- She cut it?
- Mm-hmm.

37:32.116 --> 37:34.151
That means he's still out there,

37:34.152 --> 37:35.952
alone.

37:39.557 --> 37:42.959
No, not alone. Not ever.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.830
He was supposed to follow me back.

37:46.831 --> 37:49.566
I told you to stay with me, Crane.

37:49.567 --> 37:53.003
That we would make it out together.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.822
(gasping)

38:11.823 --> 38:13.323
Lieutenant.

38:17.428 --> 38:19.829
Oh, thank heavens.

38:22.934 --> 38:24.634
That was strange.

38:25.436 --> 38:27.371
That was strange.

38:27.372 --> 38:30.440
I was awake but dreaming.

38:30.441 --> 38:33.677
I was here but-but not here.

38:37.548 --> 38:40.984
In the darkness,

38:40.985 --> 38:43.186
lost...

38:46.891 --> 38:49.759
...I heard your voice.

38:51.562 --> 38:55.365
I followed it.

38:55.366 --> 38:58.835
We made it.

38:58.836 --> 39:01.738
Indeed.

39:02.807 --> 39:04.508
Indeed.

39:04.509 --> 39:06.710
I... Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

39:06.711 --> 39:08.778
Slow.

39:17.655 --> 39:19.723
In the Catacombs,

39:19.724 --> 39:23.193
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

39:28.833 --> 39:31.335
Your move to counter
my queen's knight four,

39:31.336 --> 39:32.936
that was a false gambit.

39:32.937 --> 39:34.271
I'd have outfoxed you handily.

39:34.272 --> 39:36.873
(chuckles) Do not start.

39:38.242 --> 39:39.809
(laughs)

39:58.396 --> 40:01.598
Did you find the Witness?

40:01.599 --> 40:03.767
What of the Eye of Providence?

40:03.768 --> 40:06.269
I'm sorry, my love.

40:06.270 --> 40:09.473
It was dormant.

40:09.474 --> 40:11.975
The Witness...

40:11.976 --> 40:14.411
she destroyed it.

40:14.412 --> 40:17.948
At every step these mortals confound us!

40:17.949 --> 40:21.118
The beacon.

40:21.119 --> 40:24.121
It wakes the creatures,
but they do not come.

40:24.122 --> 40:26.790
I thirst, Pandora.

40:26.791 --> 40:29.760
I hunger.

40:29.761 --> 40:33.263
It causes me pain.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.667
The beacon is too slow, too weak.

40:36.668 --> 40:41.004
It needs to be bolstered, charged.

40:54.519 --> 40:57.921
Many years ago,

40:57.922 --> 41:01.258
you gave to me of your power,

41:01.259 --> 41:03.760
raised me to your side.

41:03.761 --> 41:07.297
You would offer that to me?

41:07.298 --> 41:09.499
I failed you.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.802
Let this be my punishment,

41:11.803 --> 41:14.070
my shame.

41:16.007 --> 41:19.342
Take what you need.

41:31.055 --> 41:33.723
(rumbling, whooshing)

41:38.396 --> 41:40.664
(gasping)

41:45.003 --> 41:48.038
(exhales)

41:56.814 --> 41:59.182
(crying softly)

42:09.027 --> 42:11.228
(rumbling, whooshing)
