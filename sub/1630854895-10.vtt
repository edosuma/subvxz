WEBVTT

00:18.685 --> 00:20.478
- He's out.
- All right.

00:21.980 --> 00:25.108
So Tres Rocas, that's where Neville said
we would find the guy.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.152
Solana, that's the archaeological site.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.362
I think that's
where they're taking my dad.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.281
Neville gave me this map.

00:31.281 --> 00:35.076
He said it should be...
here.

00:35.785 --> 00:39.831
- This? This is the map we're following?
- He's the only guy who's been there.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.374
Pretty janky, John B.

00:41.374 --> 00:42.459
Oh boy.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.421
I've been in river towns like this.
Major danger, you know?

00:46.921 --> 00:48.590
-  Don't worry.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.217
We're gonna get there,
find Singh, boost your pops.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.303
And then we'll find El Dorado.
It's a layup.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.933
You sure he doesn't know anything?

00:58.933 --> 01:00.560
Not from me.

01:02.979 --> 01:05.732
Okay, first thing,
we gotta find this guy named Jose

01:05.732 --> 01:07.108
and then head upriver.

01:19.037 --> 01:22.457
We're gonna be landing
about a couple hours out of Tres Rocas,

01:22.457 --> 01:23.875
at a farm.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.794
- It's right here.
- A couple of hours?

01:27.045 --> 01:28.546
Yeah, but Barracuda Mike

01:28.546 --> 01:31.674
says there's a bus into town
we should be able to catch, so...

01:31.674 --> 01:33.551
Jayj, what if they're not there?

01:34.552 --> 01:35.804
If they're not there...

01:37.931 --> 01:39.182
free vacation.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.392
We're on an adventure, baby. Come on now.

01:54.322 --> 01:57.408
There he is,
our intrepid translator.

01:57.408 --> 02:01.663
Mr. Routledge, leading
the charge on the road to El Dorado.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.040
Look, Carlos,

02:04.916 --> 02:07.293
it's not like I'm translating French,
all right?

02:07.877 --> 02:09.879
I need more time.

02:10.713 --> 02:14.134
Of course. Of course.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.344
You have a few hours.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.181
Prove to me
you're worth keeping alive, John.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.067
I told you,

02:31.568 --> 02:33.570
it's the Wild West out here.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.322
Sarah!

02:37.157 --> 02:39.826
-  Dad, what are you doing?
- I'm coming.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.411
No, you're not.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.581
You got us here like you said you would.
Now go on to Guadeloupe.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.708
- You're in over your head.
-  You need a doctor.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.126
- Let me help, please.
-  No!

02:48.918 --> 02:50.461
Get back in the plane.

02:51.379 --> 02:54.174
You promised
you weren't a part of this. No.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.928
Okay.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.308
Let's get the hell out of here.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.562
Let's go.

03:23.328 --> 03:27.665
Damn. Barracuda Mike's got
this import-export thing down.

03:29.417 --> 03:32.462
Yo, Barracuda, is that our executive coach
to Tres Rocas right there?

03:32.462 --> 03:34.672
It is, smart-ass. Hey.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.885
We have a deal, remember?
You still owe me for that lost load.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.595
I remember, all right?

03:40.595 --> 03:41.679
Hey, JJ.

03:41.679 --> 03:42.805
- What?
- Word of advice.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.641
- What?
- This ain't Kildare.

03:44.641 --> 03:45.725
Try and lay low.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.143
Sure thing, chief.

04:05.161 --> 04:06.746
Thank you. <i>Gracias.</i>

04:07.538 --> 04:10.541
-  There's a lot going on.
-  Looks like it's a local holiday.

04:10.541 --> 04:13.294
So we got to assume
that Singh's already gone upriver.

04:13.294 --> 04:16.339
We're looking for a guy named Jose.
He's gonna take us to the dig site.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.759
- Jose. Do you have a last name or...
- I do not have a last name.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.679
Shit. It's gonna be like trying
to find a teardrop in the ocean.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.598
I'm assuming river guides
probably hang out by the river.

04:25.598 --> 04:29.143
But if they're like the guides at OBX,
they're probably getting drunk on holiday.

04:29.143 --> 04:30.979
-  Let's start with the bars.
- Okay.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.356
-  Divide and conquer?
-  Let's do it.

04:36.025 --> 04:39.320
-  Sorry, I don't know.
-  Hi. Jose? Panga?

04:39.320 --> 04:40.238
No.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.657
- Do you know Jose? Tourist guide?
- No.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.617
Do you know Jose?

04:44.617 --> 04:46.452
-  He works on the river.
- No?

04:46.452 --> 04:48.496
Apparently, nobody knows anything.

05:09.517 --> 05:14.772
Just like old times
back in the old Pogue days, hey.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.161
Hey! You!

05:36.169 --> 05:38.338
- A panga?
-  No, I don't know him.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.839
Get off of me!

05:39.839 --> 05:41.466
Uh, I got a bunch of noes.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.218
There's not a single Jose
who's a panga driver in there.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.512
This is gonna be
a lot harder than I thought.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.139
Yeah, I know.

05:48.139 --> 05:49.599
You rat bastard!

05:49.599 --> 05:51.392
Bastards, you son of a bitch,

05:51.392 --> 05:55.438
I'll chew your arms off,
you jack-off feeder fish.

05:55.438 --> 05:58.524
There's only one person on this planet
who would say something like that.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.818
Hey, get off of me!
Get off of me, you...

06:00.818 --> 06:03.404
- Wait, are you saying...
- Yeah. That's my dad.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.616
That's one of Singh's men.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.994
That means they didn't take him upriver.
We can still save him.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.579
So how do we get him out?

06:21.422 --> 06:23.549
So right here, you have Tesoro.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.385
Up here,

06:25.385 --> 06:27.178
Orinoco, right?

06:27.678 --> 06:29.180
And they say up here,

06:29.847 --> 06:31.140
El Dorado.

06:31.724 --> 06:32.767
- Wait.
- Who says?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.436
All the world.

06:36.145 --> 06:38.648
If all the world says it,
why hasn't it been found?

06:39.399 --> 06:41.275
Some people say it doesn't exist.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.361
Some people say it's hidden,

06:43.361 --> 06:46.072
and only one very special person
can find it.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.073
Uh-huh.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.117
But most people say it's <i>maldito</i>.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.077
<i>Maldito?</i>

06:51.077 --> 06:52.245
Cursed.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.287
Over the years,

06:54.372 --> 06:55.289
people that go up,

06:56.124 --> 06:57.375
they don't come back.

07:02.338 --> 07:03.172
Funny.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.133
Funny.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.805
He wouldn't be running
if he could translate the gnomon.

07:11.848 --> 07:15.101
I'm starting to think
our friend might not be worth the trouble.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.311
You understand me?

07:20.523 --> 07:22.567
I could take him out
into the jungle.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.987
Leave him in the tall grass.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.367
Who's shooting at us?

07:35.204 --> 07:36.664
What the hell is that?

07:37.540 --> 07:38.541
Don't move.

07:46.924 --> 07:47.842
I'll be damned.

07:56.225 --> 07:57.602
It's just fireworks!

07:57.602 --> 08:01.272
Ryan, go check it out now!
Rod, keep your eye on Routledge.

08:23.711 --> 08:24.962
Not so fast.

08:29.759 --> 08:30.635
I got you.

08:31.761 --> 08:32.929
Sit down.

08:32.929 --> 08:33.971
Sit down!

08:44.815 --> 08:46.067
- You okay?
- Are you okay?

08:46.067 --> 08:48.277
- You're good?
- Yeah, I'm good. That was my dad.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.994
Sarah. Sarah...

08:59.872 --> 09:01.541
Oh my God. Dad!

09:01.541 --> 09:02.708
Good to see you, kid.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.710
-  Oh my God.
- Hi.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.547
- Hi, Sarah.
-  Ryan!

09:07.547 --> 09:10.466
- We gotta go. Come on. Dad.
-  Come on. Let's go.

09:10.466 --> 09:11.384
Go.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.095
Oh shit. Go, Sarah.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.721
Come on. Follow me.

09:15.721 --> 09:18.015
-  Go, go.
-  Excuse me. Excuse me.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.850
Oh God.

09:25.064 --> 09:29.151
No? No Jose.
They don't know anybody named Jose.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.821
Like I supposed to believe that shit, man.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.490
They don't look friendly.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.244
Run.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.495
Go!

09:49.714 --> 09:51.382
Welcome to Tres Rocas.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.719
This place makes the Cut
look like the Taj Mahal.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.596
All right,
so how we gonna find them?

09:56.596 --> 10:00.558
I'm working on it. Um, look, all right.
Tres Rocas is fairly small, all right?

10:00.558 --> 10:02.810
Don't worry about it.
We'll find them, okay?

10:05.813 --> 10:09.358
You gotta be kidding me.
We haven't been here for two minutes!

10:10.318 --> 10:12.153
<i>- Cómo estás, amigos?</i>
- What the...

10:12.153 --> 10:13.821
- Hey! Run!
- We gotta go!

10:13.821 --> 10:15.239
- What?
-  We gotta run!

10:15.239 --> 10:18.409
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Already? We just got here.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.953
- What's happening?
- Singh's men are right behind us.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.955
They're after us.
We gotta think of a plan.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.459
- Okay, why don't we just hijack the bus?
- This bus?

10:26.459 --> 10:29.378
- That only goes ten miles an hour?
- I'm just spitballing, Kie, okay?

10:29.378 --> 10:31.422
-  Guys!
-  They're coming now! Hide!

10:31.422 --> 10:33.215
-  Fruit stands! Duck!
- Sorry.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.634
Excuse me, sorry.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.676
Get down.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.136
- Duck!
-  Sorry. Sorry.

10:42.558 --> 10:43.643
Over by the bus.

10:44.727 --> 10:49.690
Did you see some teenagers run by here?

10:50.608 --> 10:51.484
No, no one is here.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.443
Don't say no.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.402
Calm down.

10:53.402 --> 10:57.406
Maybe they went over there?
Straight that way. No one's here.

10:57.406 --> 11:00.910
-  All right. Go this way.
-  Move aside. Move!

11:00.910 --> 11:01.827
Get out the way!

11:05.373 --> 11:09.085
All right. Fenny! Come on.
Let's go. Let's check down the alley.

11:20.262 --> 11:21.639
Welcome to South America.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.393
Can't believe
you just fell out of a window.

11:25.393 --> 11:28.396
If I never see Singh again, it'll be
too soon. Let's collect our bearings.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.189
- Get the lay of the land.
-  Listen.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.401
Think we'll have enough time
to make it to Solana for the solstice?

11:33.401 --> 11:35.820
Yeah, but I wouldn't get too cocky.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.738
I still can't make out those glyphs.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.949
I might have something that might help us.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.369
Listen, this is from Pope, okay?

11:43.369 --> 11:45.746
- All right? This is a family heirloom.
- Pope?

11:45.746 --> 11:47.498
- Yes, it is.
- Is he here too?

11:47.498 --> 11:49.583
- Yes, Pope is here.
- Who the hell else is here?

11:49.583 --> 11:53.379
It doesn't matter, okay?
Listen to me. It's like this thing, um...

11:53.379 --> 11:54.922
- Like, what?
- Rosetta stone.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.925
- Rosetta stone. Like a translation.
- Yeah, I know what the Rosetta stone is.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.385
Okay, I'm just saying.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.639
That's right. That's right.
No, that's right. He's a Tanny.

12:03.639 --> 12:07.268
And Denmark's the link to the San Jose,
the whole... the whole deal.

12:10.354 --> 12:11.272
Oh my God.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.898
Okay, if this is legit...

12:14.108 --> 12:16.610
...we just might crack this thing.

12:16.610 --> 12:19.780
- The gods are smiling on us.
- I'm glad the gods are smiling.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.949
- We gotta go. Okay?
- I'll keep it safe.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.034
We gotta move, kids.

12:24.034 --> 12:27.163
We gotta get upriver.
The moon waits for no man.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.717
Okay, we've got to find
this river guide named Jose.

12:39.717 --> 12:40.676
Divide and conquer?

12:40.676 --> 12:43.262
I'm looking for Jose. No?

12:43.262 --> 12:44.722
-  Jose?
- Mm-mm.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.224
Do you know Jose?

12:47.224 --> 12:50.311
- He's here.
- Here? [sighs] Perfect, thanks.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.063
Hey. [whistles] Come here.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.523
Okay, he's got our guy.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.194
-  Jose?
<i>- Sí?</i>

12:58.861 --> 13:00.154
<i>Uh, me llamo</i> John B.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.239
You know, Neville? Professor Sowell?

13:02.239 --> 13:05.159
<i>Sí.</i> You are friends?

13:05.159 --> 13:06.452
- Yes.
- The professor.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.204
- Okay, I waiting for you.
- Oh my God.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.123
Nice to meet you. You were gonna take us
upstream where you took them?

13:11.123 --> 13:13.501
-  Of course.
- Perfect.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.628
And he already paid,

13:15.628 --> 13:16.962
so we can go.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.798
- He, as in...
-  Your friend.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.049
He's waiting.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.009
Come on, follow me. Over here.

13:25.888 --> 13:26.889
Hi, honey.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.104
- I told you! Do you even ever listen?
- What the hell is he doing here?

13:34.104 --> 13:35.731
- I don't know, Dad.
- You don't know.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.400
- No, I don't. No.
- You don't have a clue? The smallest idea?

13:38.400 --> 13:41.362
-  I'm here to do what I can.
- You're not protecting me. I'm fine.

13:41.362 --> 13:45.115
- Wait, John. Listen to me. Listen to me!
- You tried to kill me, you son of a bitch.

13:45.115 --> 13:48.327
- You have every right to be upset.
- I'm not upset. Who said I was upset?

13:48.327 --> 13:49.954
-  You're injured?

13:49.954 --> 13:52.665
Have you seen the three Americans?

13:52.665 --> 13:54.416
Ladies and gentlemen, listen up!

13:54.416 --> 13:58.128
-  What do we do?
- Singh. Hey. Singh is here.

13:58.128 --> 14:01.882
- He's here. Yeah. We gotta go.
- Oh! Oh! Time to go. Time to go.

14:01.882 --> 14:04.301
- You threw me overboard!
- Hey! Shut up.

14:04.301 --> 14:07.179
Singh is in the market right now.
Get in the damn boat. Go. Go.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.681
- Get on the boat.
- Not those.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.394
I'm looking for the three Americans.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.311
I don't know them.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.729
Where are you?

14:15.729 --> 14:18.566
-  Pope and Cleo?
-  They'll figure it out.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.942
-  What are you...
- I'm going.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.361
-  No!
- Singh's dangerous. You're over your head.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.196
-  Damn it!
-  Get in the boat.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.406
<i>Ándale! Ándale!</i>

14:26.115 --> 14:27.241
Get down.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.674
I guess it's just us.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.143
Well, welcome to El Tesoro, Bird.

15:36.143 --> 15:40.064
We'll hole up here for the night.
Move out at first light.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.486
Somewhere up there is the dig site

15:46.362 --> 15:47.529
and El Dorado.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.741
With that letter and this gnomon,

15:52.242 --> 15:54.078
I think we got a shot, you and me.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.330
And Sarah, Dad.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.750
She ain't done the deep dive

16:00.542 --> 16:01.418
like we have.

16:01.418 --> 16:04.213
And I don't trust anyone
with the last name of Cameron.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.925
You think Ward just showed up on his own?

16:09.385 --> 16:10.386
Just you and me.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.560
Of course I know
what it looks like, sweetheart, okay?

16:19.353 --> 16:23.148
But I'm not here for treasure.
Not theirs, not anyone's.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.567
What do I need gold for?

16:26.944 --> 16:27.945
You're my gold.

16:29.697 --> 16:30.864
And was I your gold

16:31.490 --> 16:32.908
when you were strangling me?

16:36.245 --> 16:38.664
I'll regret that for the rest of my life.

16:39.581 --> 16:40.916
Every minute of every day.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.752
Some good did come of it, though.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.423
I've changed, Sarah.

16:54.555 --> 16:58.350
-  I saw you talking to your dad.
- He says he's just here to help.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.563
But... I don't trust him.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.278
Yeah, um...

17:09.278 --> 17:12.281
Yeah, my dad
doesn't necessarily trust you either, so...

17:15.701 --> 17:17.244
Yeah, I gathered that much.

17:18.620 --> 17:19.580
I don't blame him.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.750
Not after what my dad did to him.

17:26.795 --> 17:30.507
And I know we've been through a lot,
but we're still good, right?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.136
Yeah.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.305
We're good.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.773
Got anything to protect yourself?

17:46.356 --> 17:48.984
- Uh, kinda working on that part.
- Here.

17:49.526 --> 17:51.195
- What's this?
- Machetes.

17:51.695 --> 17:52.738
You'll need 'em.

17:53.781 --> 17:57.117
I'm adding the cost of this rig
to what you already owe me.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.203
I don't expect to see it again anyway.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.081
Look, I asked around at the landing today.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.040
Yeah.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.416
Your buds did leave this morning,

18:04.416 --> 18:06.835
but I was able to get directions
to El Tesoro.

18:07.461 --> 18:08.462
Pretty loose.

18:08.462 --> 18:12.674
Only Jose knows the real way,
but get you in the right zip code, maybe.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.385
-  It's a start.
- Thanks.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.637
No.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.138
Don't thank me.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.015
Start praying.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.644
- And JJ.
- Yeah?

18:23.644 --> 18:25.896
You owe me, dude. Ten times.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.274
Good luck.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.361
Come on.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.917
<i>So the story goes that the Guajiro king</i>,

18:47.835 --> 18:51.463
<i>who found El Dorado, as he was dying,</i>

18:51.463 --> 18:54.800
<i>said he would not just give
the gold to his sons, no.</i>

18:55.926 --> 18:58.137
<i>The gold would only go
to one who was worthy.</i>

19:02.391 --> 19:06.061
<i>Those who sought the gold
would be tested by the Jaguar God.</i>

19:10.732 --> 19:13.902
<i>But for 500 years,
the Jaguar God has found no one worthy.</i>

19:15.571 --> 19:16.780
<i>The gold still remains.</i>

19:19.533 --> 19:22.327
<i>And if you are good, if you are wise,</i>

19:22.995 --> 19:24.496
<i>and if you are lucky,</i>

19:25.581 --> 19:27.541
<i>maybe you will be the one.</i>

20:22.846 --> 20:27.226
That site's a whole day's walk.
We gotta get up there before moonrise.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.978
If we miss the solstice,
then all this was for nothing.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.313
So, listen, Sarah,

20:31.313 --> 20:34.233
I'm telling you right now,
if you fall behind, I ain't waiting.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.526
- Dad. Stop!
-  I ain't!

20:36.526 --> 20:38.654
What? I ain't. It's a matter of fact.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.241
Sorry about the cranky old man.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.120
I'm gonna go tell that son of a bitch
he ain't coming.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.623
- Dad, hey.
-  Hey, listen, fellas.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.668
I'm real sorry, but, uh...

20:56.171 --> 20:59.883
I'm not gonna be able to make it
up that mountain, not on this leg.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.804
I'd be slowing you down, that's all.
So I'm just gonna

21:04.680 --> 21:05.555
hang here.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.308
Tell you what, I got a flare gun.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.727
If I see Singh come through here,
I'll send up a flare.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.271
Let you all know he's coming.

21:13.814 --> 21:14.815
Least I can do.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.484
- Thank you.
-  You're welcome.

21:19.903 --> 21:20.737
Good luck.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.748
Don't even think
about trying anything, Ward.

21:32.582 --> 21:33.667
It won't end well.

21:35.377 --> 21:38.046
Just trying to take care
of my daughter, John.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.091
What are you doing with your son?

21:43.719 --> 21:44.678
Good luck.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.724
Let's go. Come on.

22:08.201 --> 22:11.496
Come on, kids. Pick it up!
I don't got time to waste.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.425
Come on, kids.

22:33.894 --> 22:36.521
JJ, you were right.
That's Singh and his men.

22:36.521 --> 22:39.816
- But they're not looking for us.
-  Yeah, they're moving real quick.

22:41.276 --> 22:44.654
They're looking for John B and Sarah.
They'll know where they're headed.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.239
We gotta go. They're gonna need us.

22:49.284 --> 22:51.203
Stay back. Don't get too close.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.000
-  Come on.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.878
-  Hey. Are you good?
-  Yeah.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.380
Let's get a move on!

23:02.672 --> 23:05.717
Hey, Pop.
How about we take a breather, you know?

23:05.717 --> 23:07.969
How about not? Come on, boy.

23:07.969 --> 23:10.180
You're both slowing me down.
We're losing light.

23:10.180 --> 23:13.683
-  I can't take this anymore.
- It's the only shot we got. Come on.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.436
Hey! Hey.

23:16.436 --> 23:20.023
For 30 seconds,
can you stop being an asshole?

23:20.941 --> 23:24.319
Thirty seconds? I've been
on this trail my whole life, boy,

23:24.319 --> 23:25.904
and we are on the cusp.

23:27.197 --> 23:31.034
And I got Ward Cameron,
who tried to kill me, nipping at my heels.

23:31.034 --> 23:33.453
- His daughter spying on me.
- You think she's spying on you?

23:34.663 --> 23:36.456
Are you really so sure about her?

23:36.456 --> 23:37.666
- A Cameron.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.794
That whole family is trust-challenged,
and you know that.

23:40.794 --> 23:41.711
Mm-hmm.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.965
You can stay back here
and babysit your girlfriend.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.216
It's your choice.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.552
I'll see you at the top.

23:53.723 --> 23:55.600
- Oh.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.352
-  Sorry.
- Watch your foot.

23:58.061 --> 23:59.104
Sorry.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.232
Camerons aren't really a hiking family

24:02.732 --> 24:04.192
if I'm being honest.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.028
Sorry about him.

24:07.028 --> 24:10.073
He gets a little obsessive
over the treasure.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.953
And you don't?

24:15.495 --> 24:17.456
Stop.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.958
Let's go. Come on.

24:19.958 --> 24:20.876
Okay.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.471
Whoo-hoo!

24:33.054 --> 24:36.391
- Come on. Take a look at this.
-  Sorry. I had to catch my breath.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.227
Catch it when you get here.
Take a look at that.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.480
Look at that.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.023
Wow.

24:43.607 --> 24:44.608
We did it, boy.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.485
There she blows.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.069
Solana.

25:01.541 --> 25:02.751
Come on.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.461
Let's keep trucking.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.838
At least it's downhill, huh?

25:23.313 --> 25:24.314
Do you see that?

25:25.023 --> 25:25.899
Whoa.

25:29.277 --> 25:31.446
Oh my God.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.949
It's just as the legend predicted it.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.034
See these four columns here?

25:37.744 --> 25:39.538
Mark the cardinal directions.

25:40.830 --> 25:41.998
And there it is.

25:41.998 --> 25:43.542
The temalacatl.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.796
I'll be damned.

25:48.296 --> 25:49.172
Oh my.

25:49.172 --> 25:50.757
I can't believe it.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.931
Oh, it's as real as the day, boy.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.850
A thousand years

26:01.560 --> 26:02.936
of astronomy,

26:04.479 --> 26:05.897
mathematics

26:05.897 --> 26:07.732
is all contained in this.

26:08.316 --> 26:11.861
This proves that the Kalinago
were every bit the equal to the Mayans.

26:11.861 --> 26:12.946
This...

26:13.738 --> 26:16.324
this is gonna rewrite everything.

26:17.534 --> 26:20.996
Oh, you see that? This right here.
That's where she goes.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.539
Yeah, yeah. Get the gnomon out.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.249
- Come on.
- That's where the gnomon goes.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.333
Look at this.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.336
This is it. This is the moment, boy.

26:29.921 --> 26:33.717
- Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
- That's right. Boy, look at this.

26:35.510 --> 26:37.554
Please, please, please.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.101
Oh my God.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.104
Yo, listen up.

26:46.104 --> 26:49.899
When the moon hits its zenith,
that's when the action starts.

26:49.899 --> 26:51.776
Okay, John B,

26:52.902 --> 26:56.197
I want you on translation.
Sarah, gather up some mud.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.408
And mark the glyph
so we know what to translate.

26:58.408 --> 27:00.201
- You got it? Be quick, okay?
-  Got it.

27:00.201 --> 27:03.580
Hey, hey. Aye, aye, captain. Relax.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.832
We only got one shot at this.
I don't want any back talk.

27:05.832 --> 27:07.125
Okay, okay.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.086
- Wanna help me with this?
-  Of course.

27:10.086 --> 27:11.421
It's in here.

27:11.921 --> 27:13.798
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.760
Just give it time.

27:27.228 --> 27:30.649
Oh. Whoa. Guys. Guys. Guys.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.025
This is it.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.613
- It's actually working.
- Okay.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.657
Oh my God. Oh my God.

27:38.657 --> 27:39.783
Oh my God.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.952
Oh, Dad. Guys, guys!

27:42.952 --> 27:45.288
Mark it, mark it, hurry, hurry!

27:45.288 --> 27:46.623
Mark it! Mark it! What's that?

27:46.623 --> 27:49.292
- That's the one that looks like a boot.
-  Akish.

27:49.292 --> 27:51.961
- Brave traveler. Brave traveler.
- Ah, great. Brave traveler.

27:51.961 --> 27:53.963
- Brave traveler.
- Oh, oh. This one?

27:53.963 --> 27:57.342
Yeah, that one has
the three nubs on it. That is wisdom.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.094
- That one's wisdom.
-  Wisdom.

27:59.094 --> 28:02.722
Pay close attention. Can't muck this up.
If they shine, mark it. Keep translating.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.724
- Okay, we got it.
- There's two more there.

28:04.724 --> 28:06.768
-  This is...
-  What's that? Hurry.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.979
- Wealth and... and...
-  No mistakes.

28:09.979 --> 28:11.523
-  Earth. Earth
- Earth?

28:11.523 --> 28:12.524
- Yes.
- Okay.

28:12.524 --> 28:16.444
Earth, earth. Wealth and earth.
Okay, I think I got this first one sorted.

28:16.444 --> 28:21.866
"Brave traveler, if you have wisdom,
I'll reveal the wealth of the earth."

28:21.866 --> 28:24.119
-  Wealth of the earth.
- Wealth of the earth!

28:24.119 --> 28:26.246
That's... that's El Dorado!

28:27.122 --> 28:30.125
-  Oh, wait.
- Look! Something's happening on the stone!

28:30.125 --> 28:32.627
Look, it's coming off the gnomon!
Oh my God, look.

28:32.627 --> 28:34.713
-  Tongue?
-  A horn thing.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.756
What is this? Come on, hurry up!

28:36.756 --> 28:39.300
- Patience. It's patience.
-  Patience.

28:40.009 --> 28:42.303
Patience.

28:44.597 --> 28:45.515
Patience.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.812
- Whoa, whoa.
-  There, there.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.397
- Look. That's wisdom again.
- Right here.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.441
- Yeah, that's wisdom.
-  And that's a tongue.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.693
-  Darkness, that one's darkness.
-  Okay.

28:56.693 --> 28:58.445
Darkness. Wisdom and darkness.

28:59.195 --> 29:01.573
And over there.
That's, um, seeker.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.574
Seeker.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.701
Hey. Hey.

29:04.701 --> 29:06.327
Sarah, what is hand? What is hand?

29:06.327 --> 29:08.997
I don't know.
I don't see it on here.

29:08.997 --> 29:11.374
Oh, I know this. Hand. Hand.

29:12.876 --> 29:14.544
Hand means home.

29:16.546 --> 29:17.756
Home?

29:17.756 --> 29:19.883
It's showing us
the direction to El Dorado.

29:21.176 --> 29:24.304
It's showing us
the direction to El Dorado!

29:34.063 --> 29:36.024
Wisdom. Wisdom.

29:39.235 --> 29:41.988
- What do we got, old man?
-  "I..."

29:43.114 --> 29:47.702
"I have no tongue,
but I'm always speaking."

29:49.454 --> 29:51.039
- What does it mean?
-"I..."

29:57.921 --> 30:01.841
-  Dad, just spit it out.
-  I'm still working it out.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.969
Dad, what are you doing?

30:05.678 --> 30:09.057
I've got all the notes. I...
We know which way we're going. It's...

30:09.057 --> 30:12.435
It's because I'm here.
This is about me, isn't it?

30:13.770 --> 30:18.274
Big John, I am not my father.
And I'm not my brother. You can trust me.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.779
What does it say? Hey, look at me.

30:24.739 --> 30:27.075
We all just went through hell
and back to get here.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.743
Tell me what it says.

30:29.786 --> 30:32.831
This is what we're doing, huh?
Just gonna use us.

30:32.831 --> 30:36.584
Just gonna pull us in and push us out,
like you did with Mom, with me.

30:36.584 --> 30:38.920
- Look, now you're doing it to Sarah.
-  John B, stop.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.755
No! Tell us what it is!

30:41.548 --> 30:43.341
What does it say, Dad?

30:44.259 --> 30:46.636
- What does it say?
-  Yes, John!

30:47.428 --> 30:48.805
What does it say?

30:48.805 --> 30:51.599
Huh? Tell us all, John.

30:51.599 --> 30:54.435
What is the secret of the gnomon?

30:55.019 --> 30:56.938
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

30:56.938 --> 30:59.399
- I wouldn't do that if I were you, John.

30:59.399 --> 31:00.900
I have you surrounded.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.403
You'd do best to toss over your gun now!

31:04.279 --> 31:06.990
Careful now, Mr. Routledge. Careful.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.241
Very good.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.409
Very good!

31:10.660 --> 31:13.162
Ward was gonna send up a flare to warn us?

31:13.162 --> 31:14.289
Yeah, sure.

31:14.873 --> 31:19.460
- Hey, what did you do with my father?
-  I'm right here, Sarah! I'm okay!

31:21.129 --> 31:22.046
I'm right here.

31:22.046 --> 31:25.425
-  Dad. Dad, what did you do?
-  No, no, no, Sarah!

31:25.425 --> 31:28.720
- I made a deal, Sarah. I had to.
- A deal?

31:28.720 --> 31:31.514
Yes. I did a favor for Mr. Singh.

31:31.514 --> 31:34.809
- In return, he's gonna give me all I want.
- You think this is a favor?

31:34.809 --> 31:37.478
I want you safe!
Isn't that right, Mr. Singh?

31:37.478 --> 31:39.230
Mr. Cameron is correct.

31:39.731 --> 31:43.109
When we're finished,
you can go with your father.

31:43.109 --> 31:44.861
- Safe and sound.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.614
And you too can live, you know, John,

31:47.614 --> 31:50.491
if you just give me what I want!

31:51.367 --> 31:53.369
The way to El Dorado!

31:56.205 --> 31:57.582
Sorry, Carlos.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.501
I can't do it.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.838
-  And you ain't gonna kill me.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.592
'Cause I got the treasure.

32:10.470 --> 32:11.971
It's right up here.

32:12.555 --> 32:15.183
John, John, John, John, John.

32:15.183 --> 32:18.436
You know
what the Guajiro king did to the slaves

32:18.436 --> 32:20.521
that mined El Dorado, John?

32:21.606 --> 32:23.107
He had them executed,

32:24.192 --> 32:27.028
so they could never reveal
the secret location,

32:27.028 --> 32:29.364
and he did it here, you know,

32:29.364 --> 32:31.324
on the Stone of Solana.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.035
And I think it's important,

32:34.535 --> 32:35.954
very important

32:35.954 --> 32:37.956
that we honor tradition.

32:39.874 --> 32:41.668
- So, tell me, John.
- No.

32:44.170 --> 32:46.172
What does it say?

32:47.548 --> 32:50.134
Tell him. Please.

32:52.178 --> 32:53.972
Make your choice, John!

32:57.684 --> 32:58.893
Dad, just tell him.

32:58.893 --> 33:00.645
John. Jesus, John.

33:00.645 --> 33:01.813
Tell him!

33:08.069 --> 33:09.654
- No!
- Sarah!

33:13.616 --> 33:16.327
No. No.

33:22.709 --> 33:24.502
-  John B, grab the gun!

33:24.502 --> 33:26.921
- Go!
- You promised!

33:28.339 --> 33:29.590
Come on, Sarah.

33:29.590 --> 33:30.633
Run!

33:33.678 --> 33:34.804
John!

33:47.316 --> 33:49.986
Sarah! Come this way! Come with me!

33:49.986 --> 33:52.113
No! I'm not coming with you!

33:53.614 --> 33:58.494
I'm your father. I saved your life, Sarah.
Now come with me before you get killed!

34:00.204 --> 34:03.332
Damn it, Sarah,
we don't have time for this! Now come on!

34:03.332 --> 34:04.584
John B, give me your gun.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.127
- What?
- Give me your gun.

34:07.670 --> 34:09.672
- You're coming with me.
-  Back up.

34:09.672 --> 34:13.468
-  What are you doing? Sarah.
- I said back up.

34:15.720 --> 34:18.473
Put it down, Sarah.
You're not gonna shoot your own--

34:25.229 --> 34:26.397
Here.

34:32.153 --> 34:33.738
You're one of us now, kid.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.741
- Go. I'll cover you.
- Yeah.

34:44.123 --> 34:46.918
-  Dad, come on.
-  Run! Run!

34:49.378 --> 34:51.672
Stop firing! Stop!

34:54.884 --> 34:56.094
Forget him.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.595
Forget Ward.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.931
Find Big John Routledge.

35:00.473 --> 35:03.267
Kill the young boy
and kill Cameron's daughter!

35:03.935 --> 35:04.936
Go!

35:14.779 --> 35:17.115
Okay, guys,
I think this is El Tesoro.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.617
The trailhead to the mountain
is supposed to start here.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.037
Oh shit. That's one of Singh's guys.
What are we gonna do?

35:24.122 --> 35:25.748
We gotta get past them somehow.

35:41.681 --> 35:45.393
"In five seconds, you will hear a gunshot.
That's your warning."

35:45.393 --> 35:48.354
-  Miguel! They're shooting at us!

35:49.897 --> 35:51.691
- Where are they?
-  I don't see them.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.651
Is he buying it?

35:56.779 --> 35:59.824
Shit, we're surrounded!

36:01.659 --> 36:03.744
- Oh shit. Oh shit.
- Get down!

36:06.664 --> 36:08.624
Pope, return fire! Return fire!

36:13.379 --> 36:16.883
-  There's too many of them!
-  Let's get out of here! Go!

36:20.178 --> 36:21.095
Come on, get them.

36:22.263 --> 36:23.598
Go faster. Faster!

36:23.598 --> 36:24.515
Bye-bye.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.977
- Think we're getting better at this.
- Oh yeah.

36:27.977 --> 36:31.939
Hey, hey. Ain't no time for celebrating.
We didn't do nothing yet.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.150
That's fair.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.527
- I thought we did something.
- We did.

36:36.527 --> 36:37.612
Well-done, soldier.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.363
Come on. We gotta keep moving.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.657
Singh and his men can't be far behind us.

36:41.657 --> 36:44.952
Keep on that heading, northwest.
That's the way the hand pointed.

36:44.952 --> 36:46.579
That's home.

36:55.421 --> 36:58.257
-  Pick it up, old man. Let's go.
-  I need a minute.

36:58.257 --> 37:00.343
You need a minute?
What are you talking about?

37:00.343 --> 37:03.221
- Come on, let's pick it up. Let's go.
- Go on, I'll catch up.

37:03.221 --> 37:07.016
- I just need a minute to catch my breath.
- Sarah, one sec. We got a straggler.

37:07.016 --> 37:08.100
All right.

37:08.684 --> 37:10.686
Dude, what's going on, man? We gotta go.

37:10.686 --> 37:13.397
It's just my legs ain't
what they used to be.

37:13.981 --> 37:17.360
I'll be fine in just a second.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.279
Dad, what the hell was that at Solana?

37:21.322 --> 37:23.699
You were really gonna let
them shoot me back there?

37:27.703 --> 37:29.872
Come on, give me some credit, kid.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.960
Sarah just beat me to the punch.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.047
Always about the treasure, right?

37:41.133 --> 37:43.511
Come on. We gotta go. Wait, wait, wait.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.680
Jesus, Dad, are you okay?

37:46.264 --> 37:49.433
What? Yeah.
I just got grazed. I'll be fine.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.727
Just beat-up a little bit. That's okay.

37:52.228 --> 37:53.771
Are you sure?

37:53.771 --> 37:55.648
I'll be fine.

37:55.648 --> 37:57.650
Come on. We gotta go.

37:57.650 --> 38:00.361
We gotta go. Go. Go. Come on.

38:00.361 --> 38:01.862
Double time, right?

38:18.045 --> 38:21.048
- Come on, Dad.
-  Yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming.

38:21.048 --> 38:24.135
Shh. Listen. Listen, listen.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.345
- What is that?
- Do you hear that?

38:27.555 --> 38:28.723
What the...

38:29.390 --> 38:30.391
What?

38:32.893 --> 38:35.604
Do you remember when you said
no tongue but always speaking?

38:36.939 --> 38:39.817
- How do you know that?
- I heard you talking to yourself.

38:39.817 --> 38:41.360
Yeah, you do do that.

38:42.111 --> 38:45.197
"I am nothing but hold everything.
No tongue

38:45.781 --> 38:46.907
but always

38:48.409 --> 38:49.744
speaking."

38:49.744 --> 38:51.704
-  Dad, she's onto something.
- Oh my God.

38:51.704 --> 38:52.747
Let's go.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.501
What the hell is that?

38:58.753 --> 38:59.879
It's this way.

39:07.136 --> 39:11.515
"No tongue but always speaking.
I am nothing but hold everything."

39:14.352 --> 39:16.520
-  It's a cave.
- That's it.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.398
Maybe El Dorado is in a cave.

39:20.691 --> 39:21.692
- All right.
- Okay.

39:22.777 --> 39:24.904
- Let's do it. Come on.
- All right.

39:26.447 --> 39:27.573
That's it.

39:45.424 --> 39:46.675
<i>What happened to you?</i>

39:49.178 --> 39:52.139
<i>Everything you do is for yourself.</i>

39:52.139 --> 39:54.225
You are manipulative. You are a liar.

39:54.225 --> 39:57.103
- I'm your father.
- And you are a murderer.

39:57.770 --> 39:58.729
Sarah!

39:59.563 --> 40:02.274
<i>I swore to protect you,
and I can't when you're with him.</i>

40:03.317 --> 40:05.861
<i>- You're not one of us anymore.</i>

40:06.737 --> 40:08.030
<i>You're one of them.</i>

40:09.657 --> 40:11.075
Back up!

40:11.075 --> 40:12.743
Sarah, put the gun down.

40:12.743 --> 40:15.204
<i>- I saved your life, Sarah!</i>

40:34.014 --> 40:35.808
This doesn't look
like a city of gold.

40:35.808 --> 40:38.561
It's a big cave.
Let's split up, look around.

40:38.561 --> 40:43.065
There's gotta be a passage or something.

40:43.065 --> 40:45.151
Keep your eyes peeled.

40:46.652 --> 40:49.029
I don't know, Dad.
It kinda looks like a dead end.

40:49.029 --> 40:51.240
It's just a hole in the ground.
It doesn't go anywhere.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.742
Keep looking.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.796
I don't see any other way to go.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.924
- This is it.

41:19.894 --> 41:20.895
John B,

41:21.729 --> 41:23.397
I think this goes deeper.

41:24.398 --> 41:25.232
Hmm?

41:25.900 --> 41:27.193
You see the fish?

41:29.528 --> 41:31.697
Well, they have to come from somewhere.

41:33.073 --> 41:34.283
Only one way to find out.

41:36.702 --> 41:38.913
They look like
they're coming from over here.

41:40.372 --> 41:41.540
Hey,

41:41.540 --> 41:42.875
what is that?

41:42.875 --> 41:44.585
Wait, what do you see?

41:49.340 --> 41:52.635
Dad! Hey, Dad. Come check this out.
Sarah found something.

41:52.635 --> 41:54.637
I'm coming.

41:58.098 --> 41:59.099
There's an opening.

41:59.099 --> 42:02.520
All right, that's something.
Wait, what's that above it?

42:04.563 --> 42:06.774
It's... it's a hand.

42:06.774 --> 42:08.442
-  Oh my God.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.201
I think they went this way.
There's a path here.

42:18.118 --> 42:21.330
Let's just hold up her for a sec,
wait for JJ and Kie.

42:23.499 --> 42:24.917
It's beautiful out here.

42:28.295 --> 42:31.090
I know it's probably not
a good time to say this, but...

42:32.550 --> 42:34.593
I don't know what's gonna happen
once we get up there,

42:34.593 --> 42:36.929
and I don't know
if I'm gonna get another chance.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.225
Interesting preamble, but okay.

42:43.435 --> 42:45.854
I've been on my own since I was 14, okay?

42:47.022 --> 42:49.775
Never even hoped
for anything except for surviving.

42:51.694 --> 42:53.904
I never even thought
it could be another way.

42:55.364 --> 42:57.491
But these last few months with you,

42:58.242 --> 43:00.119
you've shown me something different.

43:00.786 --> 43:02.496
And I just want to say that...

43:04.415 --> 43:05.583
Say what?

43:07.167 --> 43:08.085
I, um...

43:11.255 --> 43:12.798
You know the No Love Club?

43:14.842 --> 43:15.676
Yeah?

43:16.260 --> 43:17.386
I quit.

43:32.985 --> 43:33.944
Pope!

43:34.820 --> 43:36.905
Hey. We couldn't find anything.

43:36.905 --> 43:38.449
You guys find something?

43:39.158 --> 43:41.285
- Yeah. The path leads this way.
-  Oh.

43:42.286 --> 43:44.455
-  All right.
-  Okay. We're coming.

43:49.418 --> 43:52.963
If someone went through this much trouble,
it's got to be the way.

43:52.963 --> 43:54.923
- Looks like we're good. Ready?
- Yeah.

43:55.674 --> 43:59.428
-  Let's do it.
- I'll never fit through that wormhole.

44:00.012 --> 44:01.972
- You two go.
- What are you talking about?

44:01.972 --> 44:03.140
Dad, we finally found

44:03.140 --> 44:05.768
what we think is El Dorado,
and you're just gonna sit this one out?

44:06.602 --> 44:09.313
Gotta take
the training wheels off sometime, kid.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.564
It's time.

44:11.106 --> 44:14.860
I'll hold down the fort out here,
but before you go, listen.

44:15.694 --> 44:18.906
There was one last part of the message
that I didn't tell you.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.867
Always keeping secrets, huh, Pop? Shocker.

44:21.867 --> 44:24.036
I'm sorry. I'm telling you now.

44:24.036 --> 44:25.120
The last part,

44:25.788 --> 44:32.086
"The true and patient seeker
needs not light to see."

44:32.961 --> 44:33.962
You got it?

44:34.463 --> 44:39.927
"The true and patient seeker
needs not light to see."

44:39.927 --> 44:41.053
That's it.

44:41.053 --> 44:42.096
Okay.

44:43.305 --> 44:44.264
Okay.

44:45.432 --> 44:47.142
I've got these three flares.

44:47.935 --> 44:51.105
They're waterproof. I doubt
those flashlights will survive the swim.

44:51.105 --> 44:52.272
They're 20 minutes each.

44:52.272 --> 44:54.483
And you don't wanna get stuck
down there without them.

44:54.483 --> 44:57.111
You'll never find your way out. All right?

44:57.111 --> 44:59.697
Go. Go.

45:00.614 --> 45:03.367
I'm passing the baton
over to you kids.

45:03.367 --> 45:04.785
You got this, boy.

45:04.785 --> 45:07.287
I'll be okay.
I'll see you when you get back.

45:10.833 --> 45:12.000
Thank you, Sarah.

45:13.377 --> 45:14.670
You sure you're good?

45:14.670 --> 45:15.838
I promise.

45:17.506 --> 45:20.134
- Now go, find that city of gold, boy.
- We're going.

45:22.803 --> 45:24.972
- Ready?
-  Yeah.

45:25.764 --> 45:27.683
- Three.
- Two.

45:27.683 --> 45:28.767
One.

45:44.783 --> 45:46.410
I knew I got you, John.

45:47.327 --> 45:48.328
Ryan!

45:49.705 --> 45:50.748
Where are you?

46:05.429 --> 46:06.430
John B?

46:06.430 --> 46:08.015
John... John B?

46:11.310 --> 46:14.772
- Hey. You okay? You okay?
- Yeah.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.690
- You okay?

46:18.150 --> 46:20.194
Okay. We made it.

46:21.028 --> 46:23.363
What is this place?

46:25.115 --> 46:27.785
Sarah, look. There's something over there.

46:28.535 --> 46:29.745
Okay. Let's go.

46:31.330 --> 46:32.247
Okay.

46:36.752 --> 46:37.711
You got it?

46:41.507 --> 46:42.674
- You good?
- Yeah.

46:44.760 --> 46:45.844
You got it.

46:49.681 --> 46:51.558
How deep does this go?

46:59.149 --> 47:01.276
Looks like there's
an opening down there.

47:01.276 --> 47:04.363
-  Okay.
-  And there goes my flashlight.

47:04.988 --> 47:06.698
Well, at least we have mine.

47:07.199 --> 47:08.242
- Never mind.
-  Okay.

47:08.242 --> 47:10.828
-  Okay, flares, flares.
-  Yep. Yeah.

47:10.828 --> 47:13.288
-  Right now. Okay.
-  I'm on it.

47:14.248 --> 47:15.415
-  Okay.

47:17.668 --> 47:19.795
- Twenty minutes per flare.
- Three flares.

47:19.795 --> 47:20.921
Sixty minutes.

47:20.921 --> 47:22.047
Thirty minutes in.

47:22.047 --> 47:24.132
Thirty minutes out. Ready?

47:24.800 --> 47:25.801
- Let's go.
- Okay.

47:25.801 --> 47:27.845
- Follow me.

47:42.109 --> 47:44.111
Why would you hide in a cave, John?

47:57.749 --> 47:59.001
No, no, no, no.

47:59.001 --> 48:00.460
Does it just end here?

48:01.378 --> 48:04.047
- Maybe we missed something.
-  This was the only way to go.

48:05.883 --> 48:06.884
There's nothing.

48:08.010 --> 48:10.012
That's it.

48:11.179 --> 48:13.891
- Okay. Um, maybe...
-  Nothing.

48:13.891 --> 48:17.394
- I don't know. Just keep looking.
- Sarah, it's a dead end. It's a dead end.

48:17.394 --> 48:18.896
There's nowhere else to go.

48:21.899 --> 48:23.734
Maybe this isn't El Dorado.

48:23.734 --> 48:27.779
Maybe my dad was wrong. I brought you here
and put you in danger for no reason.

48:27.779 --> 48:28.697
Stop.

48:31.283 --> 48:33.619
Even if this ends up being nothing,

48:33.619 --> 48:38.206
if all it leads us to is
this godforsaken hole in the ground,

48:39.666 --> 48:42.085
I'm glad I did it even if you aren't.

48:43.086 --> 48:44.546
Sarah, I got you shot.

48:45.672 --> 48:48.467
I mean, you're basically homeless
because of me.

48:51.303 --> 48:54.181
You lost everything, Sarah,

48:54.181 --> 48:55.474
because of me.

48:58.560 --> 48:59.686
Not everything.

49:03.231 --> 49:04.232
I'm sorry.

49:13.367 --> 49:15.619
Mmm, wait, what was
that thing your dad said?

49:15.619 --> 49:17.955
Mmm, my dad... my dad says a lot of things.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.957
No, no, that clue, that clue.

49:19.957 --> 49:21.833
- Uh, a clue?
- It was, "The true..."

49:22.793 --> 49:24.795
-"The true and patient seeker..."
- Patient.

49:25.963 --> 49:27.506
"...needs not light to see."

49:28.090 --> 49:30.425
"The true and patient seeker
needs not light to see."

49:30.425 --> 49:32.511
- Put that out.
- We only have so many--

49:32.511 --> 49:34.012
-  It needs to be dark.
- Sarah.

49:34.012 --> 49:35.973
It's okay. We can relight it.

49:40.894 --> 49:42.312
Sarah, what's happening?

49:53.532 --> 49:54.408
Home.

49:57.911 --> 49:59.246
It's phosphorescence.

50:04.501 --> 50:06.003
Hey. Hey.

50:17.472 --> 50:20.267
-  Oh my God, you were right.
- Flare.

50:20.267 --> 50:22.185
- Flare, right now.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

50:28.233 --> 50:30.235
- Should we do it?
- Let's do it.

50:32.154 --> 50:34.489
- Careful, watch your head.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.329
There's something ahead.

50:50.464 --> 50:53.675
Oh God. Okay. Um...

50:53.675 --> 50:55.427
- Okay.
- Don't look down.

50:55.427 --> 50:56.344
Okay.

50:58.805 --> 51:02.017
- So, what do we do now?
- Um...

51:02.017 --> 51:04.811
- Uh, we can jump.
- Huh?

51:05.479 --> 51:06.480
- No.
- Yep.

51:06.480 --> 51:09.316
- No. Jump?
- Look, it's not that bad.

51:09.316 --> 51:12.235
The glyph led us here. There's gotta be
something on the other side.

51:12.235 --> 51:13.779
Just trust me on this one.

51:15.155 --> 51:16.114
- No.
- Yeah.

51:16.114 --> 51:17.240
- No.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.742
- We're good.
- No, John B.

51:20.660 --> 51:23.205
Okay. All right.

51:23.205 --> 51:24.998
One, two,

51:26.166 --> 51:27.417
three.

51:27.417 --> 51:29.503
- No!

51:29.503 --> 51:31.963
-  The flare! Get the flare!
- No, no, no!

51:32.464 --> 51:33.840
- No!
- No, no!

51:36.384 --> 51:37.385
No.

51:38.220 --> 51:39.888
-  John B?
-  Sarah!

52:05.580 --> 52:07.958
I know you're bleeding, Mr. Routledge!

52:07.958 --> 52:11.711
I know I hit you,
and I'm gonna find you, you know.

52:11.711 --> 52:13.421
'Cause you couldn't have gotten far, John.

52:21.471 --> 52:22.430
Okay.

52:23.056 --> 52:25.559
See? It wasn't that bad. We're good.

52:26.143 --> 52:28.270
- I can't make that.
-  Okay, okay. Listen.

52:28.270 --> 52:30.814
- I'll go take a peek. I'll be right back.
-  No. No!

52:30.814 --> 52:33.191
-  You don't have to come, okay?
- No, I'm not--

52:33.191 --> 52:34.693
- I'm coming with you.
- Are you sure?

52:34.693 --> 52:36.278
-  Yes, I'm sure.
- Okay.

52:36.945 --> 52:39.030
Um... I can do it. I...

52:40.157 --> 52:41.908
-  I'm gonna do it.
- Okay.

52:41.908 --> 52:43.994
- I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna...
- Okay. Okay.

52:44.619 --> 52:47.789
- Look at me. Hey! Sarah, I got you.

52:47.789 --> 52:50.584
- You're gonna catch me?
- Yes. Yes, ma'am. I got you.

52:51.209 --> 52:53.211
-  Okay.

52:53.920 --> 52:55.755
-  Ready?

52:58.091 --> 52:59.342
-  Three.
- Okay.

52:59.342 --> 53:01.469
Two. One.

53:02.929 --> 53:04.431
- Sarah! I got you.

53:04.431 --> 53:06.683
- I got you. You're okay.

53:06.683 --> 53:08.810
I told you you'd make it. Look at that.

53:11.897 --> 53:13.148
- Okay.
- Ready?

53:13.148 --> 53:14.566
- Yeah. Okay.
- Let's go.

53:16.359 --> 53:17.611
Mr. Routledge!

53:20.113 --> 53:21.448
John!

53:34.836 --> 53:36.588
Where are you, John?

53:36.588 --> 53:38.673
I know you're here somewhere.

53:43.053 --> 53:44.471
See anything?

53:44.471 --> 53:47.265
Yeah. It looks like
another chamber up ahead.

53:47.265 --> 53:48.892
- Let's check it out.
- Okay.

53:48.892 --> 53:52.062
Come on. I got you. I got you.

53:52.062 --> 53:52.979
There you go.

54:09.287 --> 54:11.539
What's down there?
I can't see anything.

54:11.539 --> 54:13.291
Only one way to find out, right?

54:38.233 --> 54:39.943
We... we did it.

54:41.987 --> 54:42.821
We found it.

54:46.074 --> 54:48.868
- Look at that, Dad.
- I can't...

54:48.868 --> 54:50.203
It's El Dorado.

54:50.704 --> 54:52.038
I can't bel...

54:53.373 --> 54:55.208
- Sarah.

54:55.208 --> 54:57.168
Hey, come here.

55:05.677 --> 55:07.804
After everything we've been through.

55:11.391 --> 55:14.227
- It actually exists.

55:15.562 --> 55:16.980
I told you.

55:18.606 --> 55:19.733
You were right.

55:21.484 --> 55:22.485
You were right.

55:26.489 --> 55:29.492
You see all that on the ground?
That's loose gold, Sarah.

55:29.492 --> 55:33.121
- Oh my God, it's everywhere.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

55:33.121 --> 55:34.039
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

55:34.039 --> 55:35.373
- Let's go. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

55:39.627 --> 55:41.504
- Whoa. Okay.
- Come on. There you go.

55:41.504 --> 55:43.089
That a girl.

55:44.257 --> 55:45.884
Oh my God. It's everywhere.

55:46.676 --> 55:48.636
-  Sarah, you got it?

55:50.597 --> 55:53.141
Ooh, okay.

55:58.438 --> 56:01.358
- Hey, to going full Kook?
- Full Kook.

56:01.941 --> 56:04.235
To going full Kook!

56:04.235 --> 56:05.612
Oh my...

56:07.447 --> 56:09.157
Let's fill this bad boy up.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.702
Oh baby. Look at that!

56:15.538 --> 56:16.831
- Nice.
- Yeah.

56:16.831 --> 56:19.292
Oh my Lord.

56:19.292 --> 56:21.961
-  There's another one.
-  Here you go.

56:25.882 --> 56:28.385
It's okay. Hang on.

56:29.219 --> 56:30.887
All right. Last flare.

56:31.721 --> 56:34.933
We've got 20 minutes to get back.
Twenty minutes. All right?

56:34.933 --> 56:37.602
- We'll come back for the rest. Ready?
- Let's go.

56:39.938 --> 56:41.022
You got it?

56:42.482 --> 56:44.067
We gotta go. Let's go.

56:49.697 --> 56:51.866
There's only one way out of here, John.

56:52.659 --> 56:55.161
You can't hide from me
for much longer, you know.

57:03.920 --> 57:05.672
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

57:05.672 --> 57:08.133
- Easy now, young Routledge, easy!

57:09.509 --> 57:11.719
Go for a little swim now, did you?

57:12.929 --> 57:15.765
Step out of the water
and put your hands up, both of you.

57:18.268 --> 57:19.310
Now!

57:21.146 --> 57:22.188
Put your hands up.

57:23.231 --> 57:24.858
Put your... put your hands up!

57:26.067 --> 57:27.277
Easy now.

57:28.570 --> 57:29.571
Very good.

57:31.573 --> 57:32.532
Drop the flare.

57:33.116 --> 57:34.868
- Drop it!
- I'm gonna put it down.

57:36.953 --> 57:37.954
Very good.

57:38.997 --> 57:41.958
Looks like you're carrying a load there,
young Routledge.

57:41.958 --> 57:43.751
You want to tell me about it?

57:46.463 --> 57:48.381
What is in the bag?

57:51.050 --> 57:52.594
Show me what's in the bag.

57:53.845 --> 57:54.971
Okay, okay, okay.

57:54.971 --> 57:57.015
Okay. Keep it right here.

57:58.016 --> 57:59.142
Look. Hey.

57:59.726 --> 58:01.978
You want it? There you go.

58:19.329 --> 58:22.874
So, you found El Dorado at last.

58:24.167 --> 58:25.418
You did it, boy.

58:26.711 --> 58:29.756
I know I was right
to keep you alive, you know.

58:30.840 --> 58:32.800
But, unfortunately for your son,

58:34.010 --> 58:36.179
the celebration will be short-lived.

58:38.848 --> 58:42.435
You have three seconds to come out
before I start firing.

58:43.770 --> 58:44.854
One.

58:47.982 --> 58:50.777
- Two!
-  I'm here, Singh. Over here.

58:54.989 --> 58:57.700
You kill us,
I'll make sure this thing blows.

58:57.700 --> 59:00.787
That roof won't hold,
and you'll never see El Dorado.

59:02.830 --> 59:03.873
Drop your gun.

59:04.874 --> 59:06.251
Drop the gun!

59:08.670 --> 59:10.713
No, if my son dies, we all die.

59:10.713 --> 59:13.299
You see, the problem is
I don't believe you, John.

59:14.759 --> 59:18.179
I don't believe that you would blow up
your opportunity to see El Dorado,

59:18.179 --> 59:19.889
even to save your own son,

59:19.889 --> 59:22.475
and even your own son knows that,
you know.

59:23.059 --> 59:26.020
You've proven it time and time again,
John, you know that.

59:26.604 --> 59:28.940
This, John, is the great quest.

59:28.940 --> 59:31.150
This is what we've been looking for
our whole lives.

59:31.150 --> 59:33.319
So put that thing out and join me.

59:42.537 --> 59:44.831
No, I can't.

59:46.583 --> 59:47.834
This is for you, kid.

59:52.255 --> 59:54.048
Run!

59:55.592 --> 59:57.051
- Go!
-  No!

1:00:00.930 --> 1:00:02.682
- Dad, let's go!
- Keep going!

1:00:02.682 --> 1:00:04.976
Take the gold. Get out of here. Go.

1:00:07.270 --> 1:00:09.689
Come on, come on, we gotta go.

1:00:32.003 --> 1:00:33.963
- You okay?
- Yeah, never better.

1:00:33.963 --> 1:00:35.465
- You okay?
- We gotta go.

1:00:35.465 --> 1:00:39.594
- Dad, come on. Come on.
- Anybody could have heard that blast.

1:00:40.428 --> 1:00:42.221
- Let's go. Let's go.

1:00:42.221 --> 1:00:45.725
-  We gotta get out of here.

1:00:46.309 --> 1:00:47.477
Let's go.

1:00:53.316 --> 1:00:55.652
I think I got
pretty banged up back there, kids.

1:00:56.319 --> 1:00:58.571
-  Let's just keep moving.
- I think I gotta sit.

1:00:58.571 --> 1:01:00.740
- I need to sit for a sec.
-  Okay.

1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:02.825
-  I just need a minute.
- Okay.

1:01:02.825 --> 1:01:05.161
-  Get my legs up under me.

1:01:05.161 --> 1:01:06.871
Just take it easy, Dad.

1:01:13.002 --> 1:01:15.380
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh yeah.

1:01:16.506 --> 1:01:18.424
Big John, it's beautiful.

1:01:21.719 --> 1:01:23.846
We found it. Just like you said.

1:01:23.846 --> 1:01:25.056
Look at that.

1:01:25.682 --> 1:01:26.516
Look at that.

1:01:27.225 --> 1:01:29.727
It was like nothing
you could ever imagine.

1:01:30.311 --> 1:01:32.730
- That you could ever...
- Ah. That's amazing.

1:01:34.107 --> 1:01:35.441
You were right.

1:01:35.441 --> 1:01:39.362
It's all, like, gold... everywhere.

1:01:39.362 --> 1:01:43.199
Sarah figured out the riddle.
The walking in the dark.

1:01:43.908 --> 1:01:46.119
That a girl. Thank you, Sarah.

1:01:53.251 --> 1:01:54.877
So sweet,

1:01:56.295 --> 1:01:57.505
you know?

1:02:01.676 --> 1:02:04.262
- One big happy family, huh?
-  Dad, what are you doing?

1:02:04.262 --> 1:02:06.723
I'm too tired to hold my hands up, Ward.

1:02:08.099 --> 1:02:10.893
So if you're not good with that,
you can just shoot me now.

1:02:11.853 --> 1:02:13.896
Well, watch what you wish for,
my old friend.

1:02:13.896 --> 1:02:15.940
- We might come to that.
- Put the gun down.

1:02:15.940 --> 1:02:17.024
Shut up, Sarah.

1:02:20.570 --> 1:02:25.241
You have it all, don't you, John?
Now you get everything, huh?

1:02:27.910 --> 1:02:29.328
Thank you, sweetheart.

1:02:31.414 --> 1:02:34.667
You get to go home, back to Kildare.

1:02:37.086 --> 1:02:38.546
Live happily ever after.

1:02:40.173 --> 1:02:41.215
With your son

1:02:41.883 --> 1:02:43.301
that loves you.

1:02:45.845 --> 1:02:47.013
And my daughter...

1:02:50.183 --> 1:02:51.559
who hates me.

1:02:57.982 --> 1:03:00.359
I'm sorry, John.
I don't think I can allow that.

1:03:09.786 --> 1:03:12.205
All right,
so, what are we gonna do?

1:03:13.247 --> 1:03:14.457
Is this ride or die?

1:03:16.334 --> 1:03:17.460
- P4L.

1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:20.296
P4L.

1:03:21.464 --> 1:03:22.340
P4L.

1:03:23.925 --> 1:03:26.219
Fricking P4L.

1:03:28.095 --> 1:03:30.014
You're supposed to be dead.

1:03:34.811 --> 1:03:36.979
I think I liked you better that way.

1:03:41.108 --> 1:03:43.903
- Stay back! Stop right now!
- Put it down!

1:03:43.903 --> 1:03:45.488
-  Stay!
- Put it down!

1:03:45.488 --> 1:03:48.407
- Stay back, stay back!
-  Put it down, Ward!

1:03:48.407 --> 1:03:49.992
Stand back, stand back!

1:03:49.992 --> 1:03:53.079
Come on! You're outnumbered, Ward.

1:03:53.830 --> 1:03:55.498
What are you gonna do, shoot us all?

1:03:55.498 --> 1:03:59.043
If you gotta shoot somebody,
Ward, shoot me.

1:04:02.505 --> 1:04:03.673
Or me.

1:04:09.971 --> 1:04:10.930
Stop.

1:04:14.267 --> 1:04:15.268
Enough.

1:04:16.143 --> 1:04:18.354
- Don't!
- You're not gonna kill all of us.

1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:20.606
I know you won't.

1:04:23.192 --> 1:04:24.068
I know you.

1:04:26.070 --> 1:04:27.822
You forget that I know you.

1:04:40.751 --> 1:04:41.752
You can't.

1:04:54.140 --> 1:04:56.350
I couldn't. I couldn't do it.

1:04:58.853 --> 1:05:00.104
-  Yeah?

1:05:00.104 --> 1:05:01.564
Well, I can.

1:05:06.402 --> 1:05:07.528
Toss it.

1:05:07.528 --> 1:05:09.238
Take it easy, bud.

1:05:10.114 --> 1:05:12.658
Your boss is dead.
You got no reason to do this.

1:05:12.658 --> 1:05:15.119
I can think
of a few reasons. Toss it!

1:05:24.462 --> 1:05:26.797
Thought you'd end up
with the gold, eh?

1:05:28.049 --> 1:05:30.134
All right, nobody move.

1:05:31.677 --> 1:05:33.304
My mate back there is dead.

1:05:35.932 --> 1:05:37.058
Because of you.

1:05:39.101 --> 1:05:40.144
Jayj.

1:05:42.688 --> 1:05:43.773
You go first.

1:05:45.566 --> 1:05:46.901
No.

1:06:14.261 --> 1:06:15.304
Sarah.

1:06:48.879 --> 1:06:51.841
Hey. Big John? Big John?

1:06:53.175 --> 1:06:54.176
Hey. John B!

1:06:55.011 --> 1:06:55.928
Dad.

1:06:58.556 --> 1:07:01.600
- Okay, Dad, we gotta get you out of here.
- It's all right.

1:07:01.600 --> 1:07:03.310
Hey, stay up. Stay awake.

1:07:03.310 --> 1:07:04.770
Please stay awake. Come on.

1:07:04.770 --> 1:07:06.814
Come on, come on. Come on.

1:07:13.362 --> 1:07:15.906
Hang on, Big John.
We got you. We got you.

1:07:16.574 --> 1:07:19.368
We just gotta get you downriver.
You're gonna be okay.

1:07:48.773 --> 1:07:51.275
Hey, hey, hey, Pop. Hey.
Hang in there, okay?

1:07:52.902 --> 1:07:55.738
But we did it together, my boy.

1:07:55.738 --> 1:07:56.989
- Yeah.
- Just...

1:08:02.119 --> 1:08:03.788
Just like we drew it up.

1:08:04.914 --> 1:08:06.707
Yeah.

1:08:08.667 --> 1:08:10.419
Yeah, we did.

1:08:10.419 --> 1:08:12.129
Bird, Bird, Bird.

1:08:12.129 --> 1:08:14.757
-  Dad, yeah.
- Hey, hey, Bird.

1:08:16.217 --> 1:08:17.468
Hey.

1:08:18.427 --> 1:08:19.386
Sarah.

1:08:19.386 --> 1:08:21.013
- Sarah.
- Hi.

1:08:22.098 --> 1:08:23.682
I'm here, Big John.

1:08:23.682 --> 1:08:26.227
Bird, you got to hang on to this one.

1:08:29.897 --> 1:08:31.107
I know

1:08:31.941 --> 1:08:34.944
that I wasn't any great shakes

1:08:34.944 --> 1:08:36.445
as a father.

1:08:37.446 --> 1:08:38.531
Stop, Dad.

1:08:38.531 --> 1:08:39.615
But you...

1:08:41.951 --> 1:08:44.745
You were the best son
any man could hope for.

1:08:48.791 --> 1:08:51.293
I want you to know that...

1:08:52.378 --> 1:08:55.339
You can tell me
when we get home, okay?

1:08:57.174 --> 1:08:58.425
Almost there.

1:08:58.425 --> 1:08:59.718
Okay.

1:09:00.219 --> 1:09:03.430
Hold up. Look, Dad. Look.

1:09:03.430 --> 1:09:05.850
We did it.

1:09:08.978 --> 1:09:09.979
You did it.

1:09:15.734 --> 1:09:16.944
I'll see you.

1:09:18.779 --> 1:09:20.573
I'll see you at home, kid.

1:09:28.038 --> 1:09:28.956
Dad?

1:09:32.042 --> 1:09:33.002
Dad?

1:10:10.206 --> 1:10:13.000
<i>My dad wanted to make
a great quest of his life.</i>

1:10:14.376 --> 1:10:15.586
<i>He wanted adventure,</i>

1:10:15.586 --> 1:10:17.504

An expedition
of one man, John Routledge,

1:11:13.852 --> 1:11:16.939
and a group of teenagers,
who are with us today.

1:11:16.939 --> 1:11:19.525
Locals, who grew up here

1:11:19.525 --> 1:11:21.193
and who succeeded

1:11:21.193 --> 1:11:25.990
where centuries of conquistadors,
explorers, and admirals failed.

1:11:26.657 --> 1:11:29.785
Today, we come together
to celebrate these teens,

1:11:30.786 --> 1:11:33.372
friends from both sides of the island

1:11:33.372 --> 1:11:37.668
who came together
to solve this 500-year-old mystery.

1:11:37.668 --> 1:11:38.919
Let's hear it for them!

1:12:11.785 --> 1:12:13.287
 Okay, I need a reset.

1:12:13.287 --> 1:12:15.581
I need a reset right now. This is a lot.

1:12:15.581 --> 1:12:18.208
- It's time to celebrate.
-  I'll take one hit.

1:12:18.876 --> 1:12:20.627
- One.
-  Bad man now.

1:12:21.837 --> 1:12:25.215
Big John would've thought
this was all bullshit.

1:12:25.215 --> 1:12:27.634
Yeah, he kind of hated
this side of the island.

1:12:28.635 --> 1:12:30.846
But I know you're thinking about him.

1:12:32.348 --> 1:12:35.392
I don't know. After everything
that's happened, it's just...

1:12:35.976 --> 1:12:37.186
it's just different.

1:12:38.354 --> 1:12:40.522
It just feels so normal. You know?

1:12:42.066 --> 1:12:43.400
Kie's saving turtles,

1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:47.446
Pope's going away to school,
and JJ bought the charter boat.

1:12:48.364 --> 1:12:50.032
And we've got a killer surf shop.

1:12:51.992 --> 1:12:53.327
Yeah, that's all good, right?

1:12:55.329 --> 1:12:56.205
Yeah.

1:12:56.747 --> 1:13:00.542
Excuse me. I... I don't mean to interrupt.

1:13:00.542 --> 1:13:02.336
Uh, can we help you?

1:13:03.295 --> 1:13:09.093
Yes. I wanted to tell you all
it's remarkable what you all did.

1:13:10.469 --> 1:13:11.470
Royal Merchant,

1:13:12.012 --> 1:13:13.305

1:13:16.225 --> 1:13:17.976
Impressive résumé, impressive.

1:13:17.976 --> 1:13:20.813
I was wondering
if you would all be so kind

1:13:20.813 --> 1:13:22.815
as to look at an item of mine.

1:13:22.815 --> 1:13:25.025
Oh yeah? What type of item is that?

1:13:25.651 --> 1:13:26.902
It's a manuscript.

1:13:27.403 --> 1:13:31.990
I would investigate it myself,
but I'm too long in the tooth.

1:13:32.574 --> 1:13:37.413
I need partners,
and you all were first on my list.

1:13:39.915 --> 1:13:42.501
- May I?
- I was hoping you would.

1:13:45.712 --> 1:13:47.965

This shows the exact position of the ship.

1:13:57.516 --> 1:14:00.102
The exact location where the ship sailed

1:14:00.811 --> 1:14:02.062
and where it stopped.
