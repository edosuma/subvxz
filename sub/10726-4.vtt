filled with people to
give my treasurer speech.

16:48.322 --> 16:50.264
I can't stand them looking
at me and judging me!

16:50.333 --> 16:52.333
I totally get it.

16:52.401 --> 16:54.168
You and I will live in the basement.

16:54.236 --> 16:56.736
We'll order from Amazon Fresh,
and I'll home school you.

16:56.805 --> 16:59.440
I've got a beautiful settee
coming in six to eight weeks.

16:59.508 --> 17:01.708
No. That is not how we
are going to handle this.

17:01.777 --> 17:04.444
Now, look, I might not
know where to buy a couch

17:04.512 --> 17:05.810
or what a sconce does,

17:05.880 --> 17:08.848
but I do know a little
something about feeling ashamed,

17:08.915 --> 17:11.550
and hiding out down here
and lying to salespeople

17:11.618 --> 17:14.854
to avoid their judgment is
not a solution to anything.

17:14.922 --> 17:17.390
A little something you guys
don't know about dear old dad...

17:17.459 --> 17:21.127
back in high school, kids
used to call me "Fatty Patty."

17:21.195 --> 17:22.461
Why?

17:22.529 --> 17:23.895
Because I was fat.

17:23.964 --> 17:25.130
Oh.

17:25.199 --> 17:28.400
Anyway, the worst part of it

17:28.469 --> 17:29.834
was that I loved to swim,

17:29.903 --> 17:32.471
but I refused to get into
swim trunks in front of anyone.

17:32.539 --> 17:33.905
The names kept coming.

17:33.974 --> 17:35.474
- Porky Patty?
- Piggy Patty?

17:35.542 --> 17:37.909
Yes, like that.

17:37.978 --> 17:39.243
My point is...

17:39.312 --> 17:40.592
[Irish accent] Patrick O'Besity.

17:40.613 --> 17:42.546
Fat Sajak! I knew I had one.

17:44.317 --> 17:46.450
Eventually, though,
I just said screw it.

17:46.519 --> 17:48.419
I'm gonna swim. I don't care
what anybody says about it.

17:48.488 --> 17:49.953
And you know what I did? I swam.

17:50.023 --> 17:51.622
Every day. And guess what happened?

17:51.690 --> 17:53.491
Swimming is how I lost the weight.

17:53.559 --> 17:58.128
Okay, um, if you're
suggesting I start swimming,

17:58.196 --> 18:00.763
I'm a little afraid that might
fuel the fire of some rumors

18:00.832 --> 18:02.999
that I may or may not
have started about myself.

18:03.068 --> 18:05.502
What I'm saying is that what
people think or say about you

18:05.570 --> 18:07.637
shouldn't stop you from
doing what you love...

18:07.705 --> 18:09.039
like being treasurer.

18:09.107 --> 18:12.142
Yeah, don't let being gay
stop you from being lame.

18:12.210 --> 18:14.309
I think your father's right.

18:14.378 --> 18:15.444
You do?

18:15.513 --> 18:17.346
Just take it, pat.

18:17.415 --> 18:19.148
[Sighs]

18:19.216 --> 18:22.151
Okay, dad.

18:22.219 --> 18:27.423
I guess, because you were
fat, I'll go back to school.

18:27.491 --> 18:28.790
Thanks, son.

18:28.859 --> 18:30.258
And what was your plan, anyway?

18:30.326 --> 18:32.360
I don't know, I figured I'd drop out,

18:32.429 --> 18:34.862
get my D.E.D., go to community college.

18:34.931 --> 18:37.331
No son of mine who's not Jimmy
is going to community college.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.033
That's fair.

18:39.102 --> 18:42.503
And I hope you'll vote
for me for treasurer,

18:42.572 --> 18:45.406
because I would really treasure it.

18:50.045 --> 18:53.880
Thank you, Madison. That was... Long.

18:53.949 --> 18:57.350
Uh, next we have Kenny O'Neal,

18:57.419 --> 19:01.088
a very special student who
is just like everyone else,

19:01.156 --> 19:03.523
except for one glaring difference

19:03.592 --> 19:05.891
which I'm not allowed to talk about.

19:05.960 --> 19:07.326
Kenny O'Neal.

19:07.395 --> 19:08.794
[Applause]

19:11.632 --> 19:12.998
Hi.

19:13.067 --> 19:15.401
Uh, I am Kenny O'neal.

19:15.470 --> 19:19.405
You may have heard some
things about me today.

19:19.474 --> 19:21.672
Uh, some of them are true.

19:21.741 --> 19:23.274
Most of them are not.

19:23.343 --> 19:27.278
Some of them may remind you of
a "Pretty Little Liars" episode.

19:27.347 --> 19:31.849
Um, this morning...

19:31.918 --> 19:34.919
I gave myself an ugly, ugly label

19:34.988 --> 19:37.589
because I was afraid that...

19:37.657 --> 19:42.326
One of you was going
to give it to me first.

19:46.932 --> 19:49.032
Um, but the only F-word

19:49.101 --> 19:52.569
I want to be associated
with is "Fiscal,"

19:52.638 --> 19:54.771
because I am fiscally responsible

19:54.840 --> 19:58.040
and I'd love for you to
call me your treasurer.

19:58.109 --> 20:00.376
I have something to say!

20:01.212 --> 20:03.579
My brother is gay,

20:03.648 --> 20:04.880
and I love him.

20:04.949 --> 20:06.189
And I just want him to know it.

20:06.217 --> 20:07.416
Okay, thank you, Jimmy.

20:07.485 --> 20:09.452
- And I accept you for who you are.
- Okay.

20:09.521 --> 20:13.255
And for whatever parts on
dudes' bodies that you're into.

20:13.323 --> 20:15.590
Okay, this seems like a
one-on-one conversation, Jimmy,

20:15.659 --> 20:17.039
that we could, you
know, be having later.

20:17.064 --> 20:17.499
Yes.

20:17.528 --> 20:19.494
Well [Clears throat] vote for Kenny...

20:19.563 --> 20:23.131
For whatever it is that he's doing,

20:23.200 --> 20:24.360
'cause I know he's good at it.

20:24.368 --> 20:28.069
And just to be clear,
I am still not gay.

20:28.138 --> 20:30.504
Madison? What's up? [Chuckles]

20:30.573 --> 20:31.573
Sit down, Jimmy.

20:31.607 --> 20:33.641
Yes, yep. I'm gonna... I'm going.

20:33.709 --> 20:35.842
Oh, I'd also very much like
to apologize to Kenny Lee.

20:37.513 --> 20:38.912
Okay. I see we're not there yet,

20:38.981 --> 20:40.581
but we'll get to forgiveness, Kenny Lee.

20:41.431 --> 20:44.662
What is the difference
between a regular crime

20:44.730 --> 20:45.562
and a hate crime?

20:45.631 --> 20:46.964
Well, that's a great question.

20:47.033 --> 20:51.368
Um, as all crimes are based in hate,

20:51.437 --> 20:55.639
therefore... I do not
know the difference.

20:55.708 --> 20:59.475
Well, of course, there are...
there are crimes of passion.

20:59.544 --> 21:01.611
Ooh, love crimes.

21:01.680 --> 21:04.714
Yeah, well, my ex-wife performed
several love crimes on me

21:04.783 --> 21:06.216
during our marriage,

21:06.285 --> 21:08.685
which is why we always
had a safe-word...

21:08.753 --> 21:09.552
nah, I've said too much.

21:09.621 --> 21:10.621
No, no. Go on.

21:10.689 --> 21:11.955
Please, tell me more.

21:12.024 --> 21:14.323
Well, we had, uh,

21:14.391 --> 21:17.125
you know those sleep-number mattresses?

21:17.242 --> 21:20.520
- Right.
- So, I'm a six, okay?
