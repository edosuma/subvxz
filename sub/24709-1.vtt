11:43.536 --> 11:44.912
THEY'RE HOLDING BACK
TO SEE WHERE I GO?

11:44.995 --> 11:46.997
THEY COULD
HAVE STATEMENTS
I'M ANN-MARGRET.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.833
IF YOU'RE ASKING
DID I SHOOT THE GUY,

11:48.916 --> 11:50.543
I ALREADY
TOLD YOU NO.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.253
I WAS WORRIED
FOR YOU.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.922
I FOLLOWED YOU
TO TAKE YOUR BACK.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.549
SOMEBODY
SHOOTS SALVO,

11:56.632 --> 11:58.175
I DRIVE UP TO SEE
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.719
IF YOU WANT,

11:59.802 --> 12:01.345
I'LL BE THE WITNESS,
YOU SAY TAKE OFF.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.513
BECAUSE I WAS THINKING
MAYBE YOU DID IT.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.640
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T.
I JUST TOLD YOU SO
AGAIN.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.392
YOU MIND NOT BREAKING
ALL PISSED-OFF AT ME?

12:06.475 --> 12:07.518
I FOLLOWED YOU
TO BACK YOU.

12:07.601 --> 12:08.978
I KNOW THAT YOU
WERE BACKING ME.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.187
I'M SORRY IT GOT
THINGS COMPLICATED.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.397
WELL, THAT'S THE WAY
IT WORKED OUT.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.606
DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.
PUT ME THERE.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.024
LET THEM TRY TO PROVE
I PULLED THE TRIGGER.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.359
ANDY, THIS
IS NOT ABOUT ME

12:15.443 --> 12:18.446
TRYING TO GET
FROM UNDER THIS.

12:18.529 --> 12:19.822
IF I WAS LOOKING
TO DO THAT,

12:19.905 --> 12:21.741
I WOULD'VE DONE IT
4 MONTHS AGO.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.708
SO, WHAT DO YOU FIGURE
IS OUR PLAY?

12:30.791 --> 12:32.001
IF IT'S NOT YOU,

12:32.084 --> 12:33.419
THE HITTER'S GOTTA BE
EITHER IN SALVO'S CREW

12:33.502 --> 12:35.379
OR WHOEVER IT WAS
THAT SALVO OWNED
IN THE RAT SQUAD.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.965
SAY, BEFORE
THE D.A. SERVES US,

12:38.048 --> 12:39.925
I GO TO I.A.B.,
I PUT YOU THERE
AT THE SCENE.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.678
BUT I RULE YOU OUT
AS A SUSPECT.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.389
WHOEVER WHACKED SALVO
FINDS OUT THAT YOU'RE
OFF THE LIST,

12:45.473 --> 12:47.558
MAYBE THAT
SHAKES THEM LOSE.

12:47.641 --> 12:50.644
THAT COULD WORK.

12:50.728 --> 12:51.979
WORST THE JOB CAN
COME AT YOU FOR

12:52.062 --> 12:53.397
WAS LEAVING
THE CRIME SCENE.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.857
WE HANDLE IT
THAT YOU LEFT

12:54.940 --> 12:56.901
NOT TO COMPROMISE
AN UNDERCOVER.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.778
YOU'D TAKE IT
TO THAT SHANNON?

12:58.861 --> 13:01.322
IF HE WAS SALVO'S HOOK,
FOUND OUT SALVO WAS UP,

13:01.405 --> 13:04.658
HE'S GOT REASON
TO SHUT SALVO'S MOUTH.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.119
TRY IT.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.454
I'M NOT GONNA
PUT YOU THERE, ANDY,

13:08.537 --> 13:09.955
UNLESS I KNOW
IT WASN'T YOU.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.332
ASK ME DID I DO IT
ONE MORE TIME,

13:11.415 --> 13:12.875
I'M GONNA SHOOT YOU.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.085
OK.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.217
THIS IS GONNA
WORK OUT, ANDY.

13:22.676 --> 13:25.429
THE APPROACH
DEFINITELY HAS TO
TAKE THEM UNAWARES.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.264
TELLING THE RAT SQUAD
THE TRUTH?

13:27.348 --> 13:30.351
ALWAYS WANTED
TO TRY THAT
ONCE MYSELF.

13:44.406 --> 13:45.658
[SIGH]

13:45.741 --> 13:47.159
I GOT AN IDEA.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.829
HOW ABOUT I GO THROUGH
SEVERAL HUNDRED MORE 2-50s

13:49.912 --> 13:51.372
ON MISBEHAVING PIMPS?

13:51.455 --> 13:53.207
FIND ONE NAMED BEALES,

13:53.290 --> 13:55.376
I'LL GIVE YOU A SMALL
SAVINGS BOND.

13:57.753 --> 14:01.590
4 POSSIBLES FROM B.C.I. ON
"GERALD SOMETIME FRANKIE."

14:01.674 --> 14:03.300
ANY OF THEM
NAMED BEALES?

14:03.384 --> 14:05.344
CORRECTIONS GIVE ME
A FRANKLIN BEALES

14:05.427 --> 14:07.805
BAILED THIS WHORE
CHELSEA OUT
LAST DECEMBER.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.306
HAVE GERALD <i>BALES.</i>

14:09.390 --> 14:10.891
THE ADDRESS
WOULD MAKE SENSE.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.685
IT'S, LIKE, 4 BLOCKS
FROM THE HOTEL.

14:12.768 --> 14:16.272
GOD FORBID THESE PEOPLE
RETAIN THEIR NAMES
CONSECUTIVE MONTHS.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.150
I WANT TO TELL YOU
THE GRAND JURY

14:20.234 --> 14:23.362
IS GONNA CALL YOU AND BOBBY
ABOUT THE SALVO KILLING.

14:23.445 --> 14:25.531
HOW'D YOU COME
TO THAT?

14:25.614 --> 14:27.741
YOU CAN COUNT
IT'S RELIABLE INFORMATION.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.202
I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT
MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT
WHAT THEY GOT,

14:30.286 --> 14:32.454
BUT I WANTED TO TELL YOU
WHAT I KNOW SO FAR.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.540
OK. APPRECIATE IT.

14:34.623 --> 14:36.083
WILL YOU
LET BOBBY KNOW?

14:36.166 --> 14:38.377
I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
WHILE HE WAS HERE.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.045
YEAH, I'LL MAKE SURE
HE KNOWS.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.590
HOMICIDE--SECOND AND SIXTH.

14:44.758 --> 14:45.968
DETECTIVE.

14:47.845 --> 14:51.348
I GOT A PRETTY GOOD SHOT
FINDING MORE OUT TONIGHT.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.312
YEAH, HUH?

15:20.961 --> 15:22.671
SIMONE.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.173
YOU WIRED?

15:25.799 --> 15:28.260
THE COCK-AND-BULL STORY
YOU PUT OUT ABOUT
YOUR WIRE

15:28.344 --> 15:29.762
THE NIGHT SALVO'S HIT,

15:29.845 --> 15:30.888
YOU GOT STONES
ASKING ME IF I'M UP.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.681
MY MACHINE
MALFUNCTIONED THAT NIGHT,

15:32.765 --> 15:33.891
SO I TOOK IT OFF.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.184
YEAH.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.648
I WANT TO GIVE
A FULLER ACCOUNT

15:40.731 --> 15:42.983
OF THE EVENTS
THAT TOOK PLACE

15:43.067 --> 15:44.652
THE NIGHT OF
JOE SALVO'S
HOMICIDE.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.029
YOU MEAN YOU WANT
TO CHANGE YOUR STORY.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.463
AFTER JOE SALVO WAS SHOT,
A CAR APPROACHED.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.882
TURNED OUT TO BE
MY PARTNER ANDY SIPOWICZ.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.468
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT
THIS MEET WITH SALVO,

16:09.551 --> 16:11.679
SO I HAD ASKED ANDY
TO FOLLOW ME

16:11.762 --> 16:13.639
AND COVER MY BACK.

16:13.722 --> 16:16.225
WHEN WE SAW THAT
THERE WAS NOTHING
WE COULD DO FOR SALVO,

16:16.308 --> 16:19.937
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ AND ME
BOTH DECIDED...

16:20.020 --> 16:21.230
THAT HE SHOULD
LEAVE THE AREA.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.440
NEVER MIND THE KILLER
ON THE STREETS.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.900
WE HEARD SIRENS.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.694
WE KNEW THAT THERE
WOULD BE RADIO CARS

16:26.777 --> 16:28.237
SHOWING UP
TO PURSUE THE SHOOTER.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.073
WE BOTH FELT
THE RIGHT MOVE HERE

16:31.156 --> 16:32.408
WAS TO PROTECT
MY COVER,

16:32.491 --> 16:34.493
CONCEAL THAT
I HAD BACKUP,

16:34.576 --> 16:36.495
AND THAT I WAS WORKING

16:36.578 --> 16:40.416
TO FLUSH WHOEVER SALVO'S
CORRUPT CONTACT WAS
INSIDE THE JOB.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.376
THEY WIND UP MAKING
WHO SALVO OWNED?

16:42.459 --> 16:44.545
HE GOT WHACKED BEFORE
I COULD FIND THAT OUT.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.589
SERGEANT MARTENS
IN YOUR BUREAU,

16:47.673 --> 16:49.091
HE WAS SUSPENDED.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.719
YOU DON'T THINK
IT COULD'VE BEEN HIM?

16:51.802 --> 16:54.596
THE LEFT HAND
NEVER KNOWS,
RIGHT, BOBBY?

16:57.933 --> 16:59.518
AND WHY DO YOU
COME TO US NOW?

16:59.601 --> 17:01.270
I'M HEARING
THEY'RE READY TO MOVE

17:01.353 --> 17:02.855
ON WHOEVER IT WAS
THAT TOOK SALVO OUT.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.273
THAT WORKS OUT
OF HOMICIDE SQUAD.

17:04.356 --> 17:05.524
HOW ARE YOU HEARING
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?

17:05.607 --> 17:07.192
I CAN'T GIVE THAT TO YOU.
YOU KNOW I CAN'T.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.652
I MEAN, YOU GETTING IT
FROM THE FBI?

17:08.736 --> 17:10.362
SHANNON, HOW DO YOU
WANT TO GET THIS DONE?

17:10.446 --> 17:12.865
HOW DO YOU WANT TO HANDLE
THE FORMAL STATEMENTS?

17:12.948 --> 17:16.160
I'LL GET BACK
IN TOUCH WITH YOU.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.704
I'LL GET IN TOUCH
WITHIN 24 HOURS.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.164
YOU SHOULD KEEP THIS
TO YOURSELF,

17:20.247 --> 17:22.082
YOU AND SIPOWICZ,
HUH?

17:22.166 --> 17:23.709
YOU DON'T WANNA
TELL NOBODY

17:23.792 --> 17:25.377
TILL I GET
BACK IN TOUCH.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.963
I'M FEELING
BETTER ALREADY.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.465
YEAH, GOOD.
GOOD, BOBBY.

17:29.548 --> 17:32.134
YOU WAIT
TO HEAR FROM ME.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.292
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO WE GOT?

18:05.375 --> 18:06.794
WALKS OFF THE STREET
TO WHERE THE DOA'S

18:06.877 --> 18:08.629
SITTING AT
THE COFFEE SHOP COUNTER.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.672
TAKES THE DOA'S
CUP OF COFFEE

18:10.756 --> 18:13.175
AND THROWS IT
IN HIS FACE.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.676
THE GUY'S SCREAMING.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.178
HIS FACE IS ALL BURNED--
RUNNING, TRYING TO GET OUT.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.471
EVERYONE ELSE IS IN
ON THE FLOOR.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.181
PERP THROWS HOW MANY
SHOTS INSIDE?

18:19.264 --> 18:20.724
UH, STATEMENTS SAY 3.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.851
SO FAR, WE'VE FOUND
2 CASINGS.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.686
HE CHASED THE DOA
OUTSIDE,

18:24.770 --> 18:26.021
PUTS ONE IN HIS LEG.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.065
THEN WHEN THE DOA'S DOWN,
PUTS ONE IN HIS EAR,

18:28.148 --> 18:29.441
STARTS SHOUTING, NOW TRY
TO TAKE HIS WOMEN.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.984
AFTER THE GUY'S DEAD.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.195
YEAH, SHOUTS AT THE DEAD GUY
FOR, LIKE, 30 SECONDS,

18:33.278 --> 18:35.030
THEN HE WALKS AWAY.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.866
GOES OVER HERE
AND PUTS ONE
IN THE GARBAGE CAN.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.202
GARBAGE CAN
AFTER HIS WOMEN, TOO?

18:40.285 --> 18:41.829
YEAH, THAT
MUST BE IT.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.580
GOOD LUCK WITH
THIS GUY, ANDY.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.748
YEAH.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.544
IT'S THE SAME
DESCRIPTION

18:48.627 --> 18:50.462
WE GOT AT THE OTHER
SHOOTING, ANDY.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.214
PLUS THE WITNESSES SAY
THEY SAW THIS GUY

18:52.297 --> 18:54.091
YELLING AT THE CORPSE
ABOUT STEALING
HIS WOMEN.

18:54.174 --> 18:55.384
IT'S THE PIMP
FROM THAT HOTEL.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.885
FLY IN THE OINTMENT.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.554
THIS DOA'S NOT
A COMPETITOR PIMP.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.222
HE'S A NEIGHBORHOOD
LOCKSMITH.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.516
SUPPOSE THE PERP'S
LOST HIS MIND, MEDAVOY.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.560
COULD THAT MAKE
THE NEIGHBORHOOD LOCKSMITH

19:04.643 --> 19:06.895
A COMPETITOR PIMP,
FROM HIS WHACKED-OUT
POINT OF VIEW?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.564
WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING, ANDY,

19:08.647 --> 19:11.108
THAT THIS COULD BE
A SPREE-KILLING
LUNATIC

19:11.191 --> 19:13.193
LIKE THAT
ANDREW CUNANAN.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.662
SEE THAT, JAMES?

19:23.745 --> 19:26.206
I CALL THIS PIMP
A POSSIBLE SPREE KILLER,

19:26.290 --> 19:27.749
HE LOOKS AT ME
LIKE I'M DIRT.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.294
HE PROBABLY DON'T
WANT YOU CROWDING
THAT CUNANAN GUY

19:30.377 --> 19:31.837
OFF HIS PEDESTAL.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.485
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

19:55.569 --> 19:58.363
I--YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
THIS IS FUN.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.574
SEEING YOU HAS BEEN
A LOT OF FUN.

20:00.657 --> 20:02.743
IS THIS A KISS-OFF?

20:02.826 --> 20:05.204
NO. HELL, NO.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.541
SO, DOES HE, UH...

20:09.625 --> 20:12.044
TAKE THE KIDS TO SCHOOL,
YOUR HUSBAND,

20:12.127 --> 20:13.170
WHEN THEY'VE
SLEPT AT HIS PLACE?

20:13.253 --> 20:14.504
MM-HMM.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.797
HE TAKES THEM
THE NEXT MORNING.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.132
YEAH.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.134
I SEE.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.220
DO YOU HAVE
TO GO IN EARLY?

20:21.303 --> 20:22.679
A LITTLE.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.140
ABOUT, UH, QUARTER TO 8:00.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.309
'CAUSE YOU'RE SERVING
THOSE SUBPOENAS?

20:29.269 --> 20:31.897
DON'T ASK ME TOO MUCH
CHAPTER AND VERSE ON THAT.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.649
OH, NO, NO.
I UNDERSTAND.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.150
I'M A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE

20:35.234 --> 20:36.652
EVEN TELLING YOU
WHAT I DID.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.946
I HAD OTHER REASONS
ASKING YOUR PLANS, LEO.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.949
WHEN I HAD TO GO IN.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.411
DON'T GET PISSED OFF.

20:46.495 --> 20:47.663
I'M NOT.

20:47.746 --> 20:48.997
I'M ALLOWED ONE
DUMB STATEMENT
A NIGHT.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.624
I'M NOT PISSED OFF.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.257
THERE WAS SOME KIND
OF HICCUP AT I.A.B.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.384
THEY MOVED BACK
SERVING THE SUBPOENAS

21:00.467 --> 21:01.760
TILL THE AFTERNOON.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.013
ARE THEY LOOKING
AT SIMONE AND SIPOWICZ

21:05.097 --> 21:06.765
AS WITNESSES
OR AS SUSPECTS?

21:06.848 --> 21:08.684
I CAN'T GET INTO
CHAPTER AND VERSE, JILL.

21:08.767 --> 21:09.935
I UNDERSTAND.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.606
YOU KNOW, IF I SAID
SOMETHING LIKE, UH...

21:14.690 --> 21:16.149
WHAT MIGHT
BE TRUE OF ONE

21:16.233 --> 21:18.527
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY
BE TRUE OF THE OTHER.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.529
THAT WOULD BE AS FAR
AS I COULD GO.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.155
WOULD THEY BE LOOKING
AT BOBBY?

21:22.239 --> 21:24.283
I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

21:27.619 --> 21:28.912
WELL, DON'T THEN.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.500
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.110
IT...

22:00.193 --> 22:03.739
IT WOULDN'T BE SIMONE
FOR THE SUSPECT.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.157
OK.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.084
IT'D BE SIPOWICZ.

22:24.718 --> 22:28.513
THANK GOD I DON'T KNOW
ANY NATIONAL SECRETS.

22:47.908 --> 22:48.784
GOOD MORNING.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.497
GOOD MORNING,
DETECTIVE.

22:53.580 --> 22:54.956
HOW'S IT GOING?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.708
CAN BOBBY AND I
GET A FEW MINUTES?

22:56.792 --> 22:58.293
GOTTA GO TO WORK.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.921
YOU JUST STOPPED BY.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.383
CALL ME LATER.

23:11.515 --> 23:12.849
WHY'D YOU GO
TO SHANNON, BOBBY?

23:12.933 --> 23:16.395
WHOA. YOU KNOW,
I WOULD'VE MADE
THE SURVEILLANCE.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.397
I GUESS YOU WERE
FOLLOWING HIM.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.482
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

23:20.565 --> 23:21.691
YOU SAID TO GET RIGHT
WITH WHAT HAPPENED
THAT NIGHT.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.944
GET RIGHT
WITH THE GRAND JURY.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.697
I TOLD HIM ABOUT
INVOLVING MY PARTNER
AS BACKUP

23:27.781 --> 23:29.574
WHEN I WENT
TO GO MEET SALVO.

23:29.658 --> 23:32.077
BEING THE D.A.
WAS ABOUT TO MOVE,

23:32.160 --> 23:34.454
BOTH OF US WANTED
TO MAKE SURE

23:34.538 --> 23:35.872
IT WAS ON RECORD
WHAT ANDY WAS
DOING THERE.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.791
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU TOLD SHANNON
HE WAS HOT.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.334
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:39.418 --> 23:42.212
DON'T PLAY GAMES
WITH ME, ALL RIGHT?

23:42.295 --> 23:43.713
RULE OUT SIPOWICZ,

23:43.797 --> 23:45.257
YOU TELL SHANNON
HE'S THE SUSPECT.

23:45.340 --> 23:47.634
WHICH I'M SUPPOSED
TO KNOW HOW?

23:47.717 --> 23:49.302
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO KNOW ANYTHING.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.138
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO
WHAT I TOLD YOU!

23:51.221 --> 23:53.223
IF YOU LIKE SHANNON,
WHY HOLD OFF
MOVING ON HIM

23:53.306 --> 23:54.724
UNTIL AFTER
WE TESTIFY?

23:54.808 --> 23:56.518
THAT'S NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS, EITHER.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.061
WHAT'S UP HERE,
KRIEGEL?

23:58.145 --> 23:59.438
THEY WANT A LITTLE
BONUS OUT OF THIS?

23:59.521 --> 24:01.022
SOMEBODY'S GOT
A HARD-ON FOR ANDY,

24:01.106 --> 24:03.191
TRYING TO GET HIM
FOR PERJURY

24:03.275 --> 24:04.901
BEFORE THE MAIN SHOW
GOES ON, HUH?

24:06.403 --> 24:09.448
I COMMITTED TO YOU
TO HAVE A CHANCE
TO COME OUT WHOLE.

24:09.531 --> 24:10.699
I CAME TO YOU
AT THAT BAR,

24:10.782 --> 24:12.701
I TOLD YOU
HOW TO PLAY THIS.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.703
HERE OUT, IT'S ON YOU.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.247
ALL DEBTS ARE PAID,
ALL BETS ARE OFF.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.042
I FEEL SO ALONE NOW.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.181
ANDY.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.057
YOU KNOW WHERE
OUR THUMBS ARE GONNA BE

24:36.141 --> 24:38.268
WHEN THIS NUT-JOB PIMP
STARTS IN AGAIN?

24:38.351 --> 24:40.937
NOTHING MORE FROM
THAT CHELSEA?

24:41.021 --> 24:42.481
NAH. HER BIG
OBSERVATION--

24:42.564 --> 24:43.815
SHE DON'T LIKE
THE HOSPITAL'S FOOD.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.359
WITH REGARDS TO THIS
GERALD-SLASH-FRANKIE,

24:46.443 --> 24:47.611
SHE NEVER KNEW
WHERE HE WAS FROM

24:47.694 --> 24:48.820
OR ANY OF HIS FRIENDS

24:48.904 --> 24:49.988
OR NEVER EVEN
SEEN HIM COP.

24:50.071 --> 24:51.156
THAT WAS HIS POWER
OVER HER.

24:51.239 --> 24:52.157
HOW'S IT GOING?

24:52.240 --> 24:53.366
OK.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.993
HOW'D SHE HOOK UP
WITH HIM?

24:55.076 --> 24:57.621
PICKED HER UP WORKING
THE BUS TERMINAL
IN VIRGINIA BEACH.

24:57.704 --> 24:59.414
ALL SHE KNEW THAT
HE WAS COMING UP
FROM THE SOUTH.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.333
THEY WERE HERE FOR,
LIKE, ABOUT 6 MONTHS.

25:01.416 --> 25:02.334
HE TOOK ON
SOME OTHER FLOOZY,

25:02.417 --> 25:04.085
A FONTELLA.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.837
AND THAT WAS
HIS STABLE'S HIGH POINT

25:05.921 --> 25:07.589
UNTIL THE CRACK
DID HIM IN.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.265
HOW'S IT GOING?

25:19.434 --> 25:20.644
ANYWAYS,

25:20.727 --> 25:22.354
CHELSEA SAYS
THE LAST WHILE,

25:22.437 --> 25:24.189
GERALD/FRANKIE HAD
STOPPED SLEEPING.

25:24.272 --> 25:26.650
HE STARTED SLICING UP
HER UNDERWEAR WITH
A STRAIGHT RAZOR,

25:26.733 --> 25:28.276
HASSLING THE TRICKS.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.404
THIS COST HER SOME ENTHUSIASM
FOR KEEPING CLOSE TOUCH.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.865
SHE HADN'T STROLLED
FOR THIS GUY FOR,
LIKE, A MONTH,

25:33.949 --> 25:35.450
AND FONTELLA
HADN'T, EITHER.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.036
WHAT'S DOING,
BOBBY?

25:38.119 --> 25:39.496
I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO ANDY.

25:39.579 --> 25:42.207
I'D REALLY LIKE
TO TALK TO ANDY MYSELF.

25:42.290 --> 25:44.209
PHONE CALL,
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

25:44.292 --> 25:45.585
MAN WOULDN'T
IDENTIFY HIMSELF.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.963
EVERYBODY, PLEASE,
BE PATIENT.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.592
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

25:52.676 --> 25:53.969
DID YOU HAVE
A GOOD TALK BEFORE?

25:54.052 --> 25:56.638
YEAH. REAL INTERESTING.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.726
THE RIGHT TIME,
WE SHOULD SIT DOWN.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.228
IS THAT RIGHT?

26:03.311 --> 26:07.732
YOU PUT US WITH HIM,
THERE'S MONEY IN IT.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.067
HOW MUCH MONEY?

26:09.150 --> 26:10.652
I GOT SOME
DETECTIVES HERE
COMPARING THIS GUY

26:10.735 --> 26:11.820
WITH THAT
ANDREW CUNANAN.

26:11.903 --> 26:14.197
THIS IS A VERY
HIGH-PROFILE CASE.

26:14.281 --> 26:16.825
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.243
YEAH.

26:18.326 --> 26:20.662
I'LL BE INCOGNITO.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.122
SKELS READ <i>THE POST.</i>

26:22.205 --> 26:24.541
ONLY PAPER THAT HAD
MY NAME IN IT.

26:24.624 --> 26:25.834
WHAT DID HE SAY?

26:25.917 --> 26:28.503
HE CAN PUT ME
WHERE THIS, UH,
PSYCHO'S AT.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.671
ANDY, WE SHOULD
REALLY TALK
FOR A MINUTE.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.256
CAN I COME WITH YOU?

26:32.674 --> 26:33.925
SHE'S OK.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.344
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM?

26:36.428 --> 26:39.264
HADN'T GOT A CHANCE
TO TALK TO HIM.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.688
UM, THIS IS AWKWARD,

26:46.771 --> 26:49.149
AND I'M SURE
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
ALL THE ANGLES,

26:49.232 --> 26:51.192
SO I'M--I'M JUST
GOING TO SAY IT.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.653
MY UNDERSTANDING,
THE GRAND JURY'S
LOOKING AT ANDY

26:53.737 --> 26:55.905
FOR PULLING THE TRIGGER
IN THE SALVO HOMICIDE,

26:55.989 --> 26:58.992
LOOKING AT YOU
FOR A MATERIAL WITNESS.

26:59.075 --> 27:01.953
OK. THANKS.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.872
THEY WERE
GOING TO SERVE YOU
THIS MORNING,

27:03.955 --> 27:05.582
BUT THERE WAS
SOME HANG UP,

27:05.665 --> 27:07.375
AND NOW THEY'RE
DOING IT THIS AFTERNOON.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.296
ANY MORE DETAILS
ON IT, JILL?

27:13.214 --> 27:15.175
JUST, UH,
ANDY'S A SUSPECT,

27:15.258 --> 27:17.427
AND YOU'RE
A MATERIAL WITNESS.

27:17.510 --> 27:19.471
APPRECIATE IT.

27:19.554 --> 27:23.475
I'D LIKE YOU GUYS FOR PILOTS
IF MY JET BLEW AN ENGINE.

27:23.558 --> 27:25.727
HE OWNS
ONE OF THEM HATS.

27:28.229 --> 27:29.564
WHO'S TALKING TO JILL?

27:29.648 --> 27:31.232
I THINK COHEN,

27:31.316 --> 27:33.485
AND I HOPE
ALL SHE'S GOTTA DO
IS LISTEN.

27:33.568 --> 27:35.153
WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:35.236 --> 27:37.405
KRIEGEL COMES OVER
THIS MORNING WITH
HIS DRESS OVER HIS HEAD

27:37.489 --> 27:39.699
THAT I TIPPED SHANNON
HE WAS HOT.

27:39.783 --> 27:42.327
SO, UH, WHAT?
ME AND SHANNON
ARE BOTH SUSPECTS?

27:42.410 --> 27:46.706
I DON'T THINK
THEY LIKE YOU FOR
THE HOMICIDE, ANDY.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.708
I THINK THEY LIKE SHANNON,

27:48.792 --> 27:51.711
AND HURTING YOU IS
SOMEBODY'S SIDE ACTION.

27:51.795 --> 27:54.339
SOME INDIVIDUAL
I MAY HAVE OFFENDED
IN THE PAST?

27:54.422 --> 27:57.759
WE GOT TO GET ON THE RECORD
BEFORE THE D.A. SERVES US.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.302
NO WAY
SHANNON DON'T BURY YOU.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.262
ALREADY EXPLAINED
TO HIM YESTERDAY
WHAT I WAS DOING THERE.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.555
TAKE IT TO FANCY?

28:02.639 --> 28:04.265
YOU DON'T FIGURE
HE'S WHO'S LOOKING
TO HANG ME?

28:04.349 --> 28:05.558
NO. HE'S GOT EASIER WAYS
TO REACH OUT.

28:05.642 --> 28:06.685
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

28:06.768 --> 28:08.311
SORRY.

28:08.395 --> 28:10.689
E.S.U.'S GOT A GUY
HOLED UP IN A BUILDING.

28:10.772 --> 28:13.942
THEY THINK IT MIGHT BE
YOUR MAN.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.820
THERE GOES
MY PHONE TIPSTER'S PAYDAY.

28:42.929 --> 28:45.223
Uniformed Officer:
THEY GOT HIM. THEY'RE
BRINGING HIM DOWN.

28:45.306 --> 28:46.766
Fancy:
ANY OF OURS HURT?

28:46.850 --> 28:49.227
NO. PERP WAS KICKING
ON THE DOOR OF
THAT GUY'S APARTMENT.

28:49.310 --> 28:51.479
FINALLY
SHOOTS THE LOCK OFF.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.356
GUY CLIMBS OUT THE WINDOW,
DOWN THE BACK WAY,

28:53.440 --> 28:55.150
HAILS A SECTOR CAR
ON THE STREET.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.193
PERP ACCUSE THE GUY
OF STEALING HIS WOMEN?

28:57.277 --> 28:58.862
NO. SAID
HE OWED HIM CRACK.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.196
THIS GUY DEALS?

29:00.280 --> 29:01.281
SAYS HE JUST MOVED IN.

29:01.364 --> 29:03.742
PERP'S CONFUSING HIM
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

29:03.825 --> 29:04.743
PERP DOES GET PEOPLE
CONFUSED.

29:04.826 --> 29:08.705
...SUE YOU BOTH
FOR VIOLATING MY
CONSTITUTIONAL PREMISES!

29:08.788 --> 29:10.832
Officer:
HE'S ABOUT AS LOONY
AS I EVER HEARD.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.083
WHAT?!

29:12.167 --> 29:13.084
[GUNSHOT]

29:13.168 --> 29:14.127
GET DOWN!

29:14.210 --> 29:16.880

THE SCHOOL DISTRICT!

29:16.963 --> 29:18.506
GET DOWN! GET DOWN!

29:19.841 --> 29:21.134
Shannon:
GET DOWN!

29:21.217 --> 29:22.635
I THINK IT CAME
FROM THAT BUILDING!

29:22.719 --> 29:23.678
IT WAS HIM!

29:23.762 --> 29:24.929
TAKE HIS GUN!

29:25.013 --> 29:25.972
CALM DOWN, MA'AM!

29:26.055 --> 29:27.265
TAKE HIS GUN!
HE SHOT IT!

29:27.348 --> 29:28.767
HEY!

29:28.850 --> 29:30.727
SHANNON, WE'RE GOING TO
STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT, OK?

29:30.810 --> 29:33.688
I DISCHARGED THIS WEAPON
AT A PRIVATE RANGE
THIS MORNING.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.231
OK. JUST HOLSTER
YOUR WEAPON.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.358
I'M TELLING YOU WHY
THIS GUN HAS BEEN FIRED.

29:37.442 --> 29:38.443
Fancy: LOOK, I'M NOT
ARGUING WITH YOU.

29:38.526 --> 29:39.903
JUST HOLSTER THE WEAPON

29:39.986 --> 29:41.988
AND LET'S STRAIGHTEN
THIS OUT.

30:18.107 --> 30:19.859
CONSISTENT TO THIS MINUTE,

30:19.943 --> 30:23.154
I CONDUCTED A PRIVATE
2-PART INVESTIGATION.

30:23.238 --> 30:26.950
IDENTIFY A: JOE SALVO'S
ORGANIZED CRIME HIGHER-UPS,

30:27.033 --> 30:30.495
AND B: THOSE ON THIS JOB
HIS HIGHER-UPS HAD REACHED.

30:30.578 --> 30:32.038
GET OFF IT, SEAN.

30:32.121 --> 30:35.291
A: YOU JUST SHOT
AT A COP.

30:35.375 --> 30:36.793
NOW, THAT'S FALSE.

30:36.876 --> 30:38.044
WHOEVER'S TELLING YOU
THAT, DETECTIVE,

30:38.127 --> 30:39.796
FOR GOD'S SAKE
DON'T BUY INTO IT.

30:39.879 --> 30:41.589
I'M TRYING NOT TO LEAP
TO CONCLUSIONS.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.633
B: YOU'RE ON TAPE
6 WEEKS AGO,

30:43.716 --> 30:45.134
CONFESSING TO

30:45.218 --> 30:46.511
YOU'RE WHO
TOOK SALVO OUT.

30:46.594 --> 30:50.139
PETER BOTALLICCO
IS AN O.C. HIGHER-UP
I INFILTRATED

30:50.223 --> 30:52.475
AND WAS MAKING
REPRESENTATIONS TO

30:52.559 --> 30:54.102
TO ESTABLISH
CREDIBILITY WITH.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.603
[DOOR OPENS]

31:02.569 --> 31:06.447
I NEED YOU TO TRY
AND GET SOMETHING SENSIBLE
OUT OF THAT PIMP.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.033
I'D HAVE LIKED
TO HEAR THIS GUY
FLOAT AN ALIBI

31:09.117 --> 31:11.744
OFF WHACKING LINCOLN
IN THAT THEATER.

31:16.249 --> 31:19.002
Martinez: YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU SIGNED NOW,
RIGHT?

31:19.085 --> 31:21.337
SO THIS IS
MY DAY IN COURT?
THIS IS COURT TV?

31:21.421 --> 31:22.672
WHERE JOHNNIE COCHRAN AT?

31:22.755 --> 31:24.007
WHERE O.J. AT?

31:24.090 --> 31:25.341
Russell: WE WANT
TO HEAR YOUR STORY.

31:25.425 --> 31:26.676
YOU'RE THE STAR TODAY.

31:26.759 --> 31:27.886
FIFTIEST LAWYERS
WITH CLUBS.

31:27.969 --> 31:29.679
NOBODY ESCAPES
MY SECRETS.

31:29.762 --> 31:30.847
Sipowicz: JUST TELL ME
WHAT TO CALL YOU.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.932
ANY DAMN THING
YOU WANT.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.893
CALL ME STEVE.

31:34.976 --> 31:36.895
THAT'S MY MOTHER'S NAME.

31:36.978 --> 31:38.187
Russell: STEVE'S
WHAT YOUR MOTHER
CALLED YOU.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.647
COME AS HARD
AS YOU WANT.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.191
I'M SAYING
WHAT I CHOOSE
TO REVEAL.

31:42.275 --> 31:43.776
YEAH, YOU'RE IN
THE DRIVER'S SEAT,
STEVE.

31:43.860 --> 31:47.155
ALL'S WE'D LIKE REVEALED
IS HOW THESE PEOPLE
BETRAYED YOU

31:47.238 --> 31:48.781
AND BROUGHT ON
WHATEVER OCCURRED.

31:48.865 --> 31:51.034
BETRAYED PEOPLE
GOT BETRAYED.

31:51.117 --> 31:54.037
THAT LAW'S BEFORE
ANY COP OR POLICE
ADMINISTRATION

31:54.120 --> 31:56.748
OR WALKING THE STREETS
OR GOD ALMIGHTY.

31:56.831 --> 31:57.624
SIT!

31:57.707 --> 31:58.833
DID CHELSEA
DOUBLE-CROSS YOU?

31:58.917 --> 32:00.251
SHE'D BE DEALT WITH
IF SHE HAD.

32:00.335 --> 32:01.711
SHE STILL WALKING
THE STREETS OF AMERICA?

32:01.794 --> 32:03.212
I BELIEVE
SHE'S STILL SOMEWHERE
IN THE STATES.

32:03.296 --> 32:04.547
THEN YOU ANSWERED
YOUR QUESTION!

32:04.631 --> 32:07.383
GERALD, FRANKIE, STEVE.
I GOT OTHER FISH TO FRY!

32:07.467 --> 32:08.468
COME AS HARD

32:08.551 --> 32:09.594
I WANT TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENED

32:09.677 --> 32:10.970

OF THAT FLEABAG HOTEL

32:11.054 --> 32:12.472
AND ON THE STREET OUTSIDE!

32:12.555 --> 32:14.515
AND THEN I WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT THAT COFFEE SHOP!

32:14.599 --> 32:16.017
AND IF YOU DON'T
START TELLING ME,

32:16.100 --> 32:18.102
YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT
HOW SILLY YOUR
LAST STATEMENT WAS.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.979
FONTELLA STILL
WALKING THE STREETS?

32:20.063 --> 32:21.064
OR CHELSEA BOTH?

32:21.147 --> 32:23.566
THEN I AIN'T COMPLETED
MY MISSION!

32:23.650 --> 32:25.026
THIS GUY NEEDS TIME
ON A COT.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.945

MY REMORSE.

YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANT
TO WRITE IT NOW?

36:03.035 --> 36:05.329
