00:03.210 --> 00:04.920
Previously on
Andi Mack...

00:04.920 --> 00:06.920
Our no-breakup breakup.
It works.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.790
We're still
pretty lucky to have
each other as exes.

00:08.790 --> 00:11.540
Are you kidding?
We are the best exes ever.

00:11.540 --> 00:13.040
And we'll always
be able to hang out

00:13.040 --> 00:14.330
no matter what
buttons get pushed.

00:14.330 --> 00:16.080
Even if it's
the biggest button
of them all.

00:16.080 --> 00:17.250
What button's that?

00:17.250 --> 00:20.210
-The one where one of us
likes somebody else.
-Right.

00:20.210 --> 00:23.580
Can you imagine
what it's gonna be like
when that happens?

00:23.580 --> 00:25.880
Sorry. I've gotta go.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.080
Looks like I won't
have to imagine it.

00:29.080 --> 00:31.420
You're about to start
a girl's basketball team.

00:31.420 --> 00:33.710
Hey, welcome.
Glad you guys showed up.

00:33.710 --> 00:35.420
I'm Buffy.
(whistle blows)

00:38.750 --> 00:40.670
Buffy:
Shoot with one hand,
not two.

00:40.670 --> 00:43.420
Ease up.
Don't drag your feet.

00:43.420 --> 00:44.880
This is a nightmare.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.120
They're terrible.

00:46.120 --> 00:47.960
Hey! You made it.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.790
You should see your
face right now, bro.

00:49.790 --> 00:51.380
-Do you know
what's in that bag?
-Yeah.

00:51.380 --> 00:54.210
I'm gonna go.
I think you should too.

00:54.210 --> 00:56.000
Cyrus, Office Wright
has some questions.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.620
-About?
-The gun.

00:57.620 --> 00:59.080
Am I in trouble?

01:04.790 --> 01:06.960
(whistle)
Okay, Spikes.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.750
Remember the drill
we did yesterday?
The three-way weave.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.210
You're one,
you're two,
you're three.

01:12.210 --> 01:15.460
One passes to two,
two passes to three
and three passes to one.

01:17.420 --> 01:20.120
Come on.
We just did it yesterday.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.040
You girls are up next.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.880
Buffy:
One pass to two!

01:24.880 --> 01:27.250
You're two now.
Pass to three!

01:27.250 --> 01:28.920
That's it, okay.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.790
Now, three pass to one.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.420
Where are you one?

01:32.420 --> 01:34.420
No, up here.
It's a weave.

01:36.460 --> 01:37.620
Pass to two.

01:37.620 --> 01:39.830
New two,
other two.

01:39.830 --> 01:43.790
Now pass--
Wait. Who's three?

01:46.420 --> 01:47.750
Take five.

01:51.670 --> 01:54.330
Breathe in,
breathe out.

01:54.330 --> 01:56.500
-Who is strong?
-I am strong.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.380
-Who can do this?
-I can do this.

01:58.380 --> 01:59.830
-How much longer
-19 minutes.

01:59.830 --> 02:00.830

03:58.080 --> 04:00.080
-Here's the thing.
-Both: Cyrus!

04:01.170 --> 04:03.080
He really wants to talk.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.210
-Shouldn't I at least
hear him out?
-Buffy: No.

04:05.210 --> 04:07.000

04:09.960 --> 04:11.880
We don't want anything
to happen to you.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.880
He obviously feels bad.

04:13.880 --> 04:16.210
-He keeps calling.
-Then block him on your phone.

04:17.670 --> 04:19.290

04:25.380 --> 04:26.830

-There.

04:26.830 --> 04:27.880
Satisfied?

04:29.670 --> 04:31.330
What could be
more important than me?

04:35.750 --> 04:37.960
Jonah.
Like I had to ask.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.710
Not Jonah.

04:39.710 --> 04:40.620
Her.

04:43.330 --> 04:45.000
I knew there was somebody.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Since when?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.210
He had this look
on his face the other day.

04:48.210 --> 04:49.960
Like he was trying
to tell me something.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.500
Oh, I know that look.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.040
You just want to shake him
and say, "Spit it out, man!"

04:54.040 --> 04:56.380
Well, it's pretty clear
what that look means.

04:59.670 --> 05:01.830
-We're staring.
-This is rude.

05:01.830 --> 05:03.670
We should stop.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.420
Let's go meet her.

05:08.420 --> 05:11.420
No! We need to wait
for Jonah to introduce us.

05:11.420 --> 05:14.290
He's probably worried
about how I'll react.

05:14.290 --> 05:16.080
If I do it now,

05:16.080 --> 05:18.500
he'll know I'm totally
fine with her.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.670
I wouldn't--

05:21.620 --> 05:23.420
Hello! Friend of Jonah Beck.

05:25.210 --> 05:27.120
Excuse me.
I'm just trying to say hi.

05:28.210 --> 05:29.210
Hello?

05:35.540 --> 05:37.380
Did you see that?

05:37.380 --> 05:39.210
She wouldn't even
turn around!

05:39.210 --> 05:40.460
She just kept walking.

05:40.460 --> 05:42.120
Let's give her a chance.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.460
I just did.

05:48.620 --> 05:49.750
Is this a good time?

05:49.750 --> 05:50.960
For what?

05:52.210 --> 05:53.420
For this.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.210
I was cleaning out
the garage and--

05:57.210 --> 05:58.580
Do you know what
we had down there?

05:58.580 --> 05:59.710
I do.

05:59.710 --> 06:01.380
Old phones,
old computers,

06:01.380 --> 06:03.620
fax machine,
a slow cooker.

06:03.620 --> 06:06.210
And that's why I asked you
to clean out the garage.

06:06.210 --> 06:08.170
Well, I can't throw
them away, Celia.

06:08.170 --> 06:09.420
They're useless.

06:09.420 --> 06:10.620
No, they're not.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.080
I'm taking their parts
and making these
little sculptures.

06:14.250 --> 06:15.790
I'm calling them Creoples.

06:15.790 --> 06:17.250
Oh, they have a name.

06:17.250 --> 06:19.580
Yeah. Creature plus people.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.540
Creoples.

06:20.540 --> 06:21.670
Okay.

06:21.670 --> 06:23.080
This is my first one.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.080
What do you think?

06:24.080 --> 06:25.750
-He's adorable.
-Oh.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.580
Creoples are genderless.

06:28.830 --> 06:30.880
-Hm. This is a fun fact.
-Uh-huh.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.920
(giggles)

06:46.080 --> 06:48.960
Andiman! Got any free time
in the next couple of days?

06:48.960 --> 06:50.120
There's someone
I want you to meet.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.210
Would that be
your new girlfriend?

06:53.210 --> 06:55.380
I'm not sure
about girlfriend.

06:55.380 --> 06:56.670
You know, labels.

06:56.670 --> 06:59.460
But yeah, her name's Libby.
I told her all about you.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.170
She said you sounded cool
and wants to meet.

07:01.170 --> 07:04.000
Well, that wasn't really
the impression that I got.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.540
I saw you two this morning.

07:06.540 --> 07:08.290
Okay.

07:08.290 --> 07:11.120
After you walked away,
I tried to introduce
myself to her.

07:12.210 --> 07:14.250
I called out
several times,

07:14.250 --> 07:15.250
but she iced me.

07:15.250 --> 07:16.710
She didn't hear you.

07:16.710 --> 07:18.040
You weren't there.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.290
And I know you want
everybody to be friends

07:20.290 --> 07:23.170
but Libby clearly has
some kind of problem with me.

07:23.170 --> 07:25.580
She's either jealous,
or unfriendly,

07:25.580 --> 07:27.620
-or stuck up--
-Andi. Libby's deaf.

07:31.170 --> 07:32.620
Oh.

07:33.960 --> 07:38.380
Let's just say there is
nothing more humiliating

07:38.380 --> 07:40.830
than being 100%
in the wrong.

07:40.830 --> 07:43.670
There was that one time
that I wore my pants
backward to school.

07:43.670 --> 07:45.250
You were six.

07:45.250 --> 07:47.670
And your pants had
elastic waistbands.

07:47.670 --> 07:49.330
The front looked
like the back.

07:49.330 --> 07:53.420
And yet, I'm still
haunted by the moment that
I looked down and realized,

07:53.420 --> 07:55.670
(British accent)
'Ello, pockets!

07:59.500 --> 08:01.210
T.J.'s not sitting
with his friends.

08:01.210 --> 08:02.460
Wonder why.

08:04.710 --> 08:07.580
Oh, look.
It's "Taste of Paris" Day!

08:07.580 --> 08:09.170
You know what that means.

08:09.170 --> 08:12.210
The a Sloppy Joe
is a Sloppy Pierre?

08:12.210 --> 08:14.380
That's fun, right?

08:18.170 --> 08:20.960
I'm just gonna do
a quick walk-by,
make sure he's okay.

08:26.210 --> 08:28.960
I'm feeling very managed
right now.

08:36.670 --> 08:38.580
Bex:
That's how
it's gonna be, huh?

08:38.580 --> 08:40.460
Come on.

08:40.460 --> 08:43.420
No? Not gonna
play nice, huh?

08:43.420 --> 08:46.250
Ugh! Why?

08:46.250 --> 08:48.210
Here you go.

08:48.210 --> 08:49.250
What's this?

08:49.250 --> 08:51.580
I asked you to bring
me a smoothie.

08:51.580 --> 08:53.210
It is a smoothie.

08:53.210 --> 08:54.420
It's called the Green Goddess.

08:54.420 --> 08:56.120
(sniffs)
What's in it?

08:56.120 --> 08:58.210
Baby kale,
spinach, cilantro--

08:58.210 --> 09:00.040
I'm not hearing ice cream.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.750
Ahh-ha!

09:02.750 --> 09:04.580
Yes! Finally!

09:04.580 --> 09:07.750
Ha-ha-- Oh!
Why?

09:07.750 --> 09:09.040
I could fix that.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.040
Why didn't you
say so sooner?

09:11.040 --> 09:12.250
I wanted to give
you a chance.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.710
Well, now you get
the chance to show off.

09:14.710 --> 09:16.580
Well, hold my smoothie.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.380
You know, I can see
leaves in this.

09:20.380 --> 09:22.080
If I can see plant life,

09:22.080 --> 09:24.420
it, by definition,
is not a smoothie.

09:24.420 --> 09:26.120
Done.

09:26.120 --> 09:28.290
Really?
How did you--

09:29.880 --> 09:33.000
Oh. I guess
that'll work.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.830
I guess so because
it's working.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.330
Hm. What's going
on over here?

09:41.330 --> 09:44.120
Oh, the hydraulics
gave out.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.210
I can fix that.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.460
That's okay.
We're gonna call
the manufacturer.

09:48.460 --> 09:50.330
Why? I'm right here.

09:50.330 --> 09:52.960
But we don't
have any tools.
Not even a screw driver.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.620
Eh. Who needs tools?

09:55.620 --> 09:57.500
People who fix things?

10:03.880 --> 10:05.540
Voila!

10:05.540 --> 10:09.000
Ahh we needed here
was an extension cord,
which you'll never notice.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.330
And this leg was wobbling.

10:11.330 --> 10:13.330
Ha! Not anymore.

10:13.330 --> 10:16.830
The rug was slipping.

10:16.830 --> 10:19.170
And this is the easy one.

10:19.170 --> 10:21.330
-I really like that brush.
-I know, me too.

10:22.380 --> 10:25.040
Works like a charm, huh?

10:25.040 --> 10:27.120
And is this
the right height?

10:27.120 --> 10:29.830
'Cause I can make it
taller or shorter,
whatever you want.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.960
You really didn't have
to do all this.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.210
-If there's anything else
I can--
-No, no, no.

10:34.210 --> 10:35.250
You got everything.

10:36.290 --> 10:37.540
Okay.

10:40.620 --> 10:41.620
Hey.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.080
I'm Buffy.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.380
Oh, yeah?

10:45.380 --> 10:48.710
As in, "Into every
generation a slayer is born?"

10:48.710 --> 10:51.170
Have you seen
any vampires around?

10:51.170 --> 10:52.210
You're welcome.

10:52.210 --> 10:53.710
I guess you get
that a lot.

10:53.710 --> 10:55.500
Only since I was two.

10:56.540 --> 10:58.290
I'm Kira, by the way.

10:58.290 --> 10:59.460
You're new, right?

10:59.460 --> 11:01.670
Day three.
Just transferred here
from Monroe.

11:01.670 --> 11:03.250
I've seen you play.

11:03.250 --> 11:05.040
You're the shooting guard
for the Monarchs.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.790
You've got a sick
fade-away!

11:08.580 --> 11:10.880
We could really use
a shooting guard.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.620
Jefferson has
a girl's team?

11:12.620 --> 11:15.620
Yeah, it's also new.
This year.

11:15.620 --> 11:17.290
Or-- this week.

11:17.290 --> 11:18.620
It was actually my idea.

11:19.620 --> 11:22.080
That's why you're being
so friendly.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.580
Wait, no.
I'm just friendly.

11:25.620 --> 11:27.420
But... if you did
join the team,

11:27.420 --> 11:29.620
we could get a coach
and play other schools.

11:29.620 --> 11:31.880
Even if you don't,
we can still be friends.

11:31.880 --> 11:35.620
But it would be so cool
if you joined the team.

11:35.620 --> 11:37.080
Please join the team.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.620
I'm in, slayer.

11:38.620 --> 11:41.250
No, you're the slayer.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.210
When do I get to
meet the team?

11:43.210 --> 11:44.880
Heads up.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.080
Uh, this team...
Well...

11:48.420 --> 11:50.710
I'm trying to find
the right words
to prepare you

11:50.710 --> 11:53.210
and all I'm coming
up with is...

11:53.210 --> 11:54.420
hot mess.

11:54.420 --> 11:56.420
They can't be that bad.

11:56.420 --> 11:58.920
Four of them
tripped coming out
of the locker room.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.250
(giggles)

12:09.210 --> 12:10.710
Hey!

12:10.710 --> 12:12.960
Andi, Libby.
Libby, Andi.

12:15.170 --> 12:16.460
We learned it
in fifth grade.

12:16.460 --> 12:19.120
But I only remember
a few words.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.080
My favorite was dolphin.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.620
-(giggles)
-It's okay, you can text.

12:23.620 --> 12:24.710
That's what we do.

12:24.710 --> 12:28.670
But then aren't all
your conversations just--

12:32.460 --> 12:33.880
Staring at your phone?

12:33.880 --> 12:35.620
Everyone stares
at their phone.

12:38.290 --> 12:39.750
(giggling)

12:39.750 --> 12:41.000
What?

12:42.250 --> 12:43.790
Libby:
I like your headband.

12:43.790 --> 12:45.960
Thank you.
I love yours.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.420
Libby:
Thanks. I made it.

12:47.420 --> 12:49.960
Did you?
I made mine too.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.710
Libby:
A necktie?

12:51.710 --> 12:55.120
Yeah, I know. A necktie.
Not the most original.

12:57.170 --> 12:58.710
But what is this?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.170
Do you know
what this is?

13:01.170 --> 13:02.330
A headband?

13:02.330 --> 13:05.000
Yes. But what
is it made of?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.620
Headband material?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.330
Libby:
Clueless.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.040
(giggles)
Yeah.

13:12.330 --> 13:13.830
Is this a popcorn bucket?

13:13.830 --> 13:15.750
Did you make this
from a popcorn bucket?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Libby:
Looks good. It's yours.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Thank you.
And you keep mine.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.750
There is someplace
I really want to show you.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.000
Is that okay?
Can I borrow her?

13:32.170 --> 13:33.750
Yeah. Sure.

13:33.750 --> 13:34.750
Come on.

13:41.170 --> 13:42.460
Say nice things about me?

13:46.120 --> 13:47.120
Stole my date.

13:49.750 --> 13:51.290
Spikes! Listen up.

13:52.380 --> 13:53.750
This is Kira.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.580
She was the shooting guard
for the Monroe Monarchs

13:55.580 --> 13:58.170
and they were undefeated
last season.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.380
Now she's ours.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.920
Hey. Happy to be here.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.420
Come on, guys!

14:02.420 --> 14:04.460
Let's take the Spikes
to the next level.

14:04.460 --> 14:05.620
All:
Yeah!

14:05.620 --> 14:07.210
Ready when you are.

14:07.210 --> 14:08.460
Let's do this.

14:08.460 --> 14:09.880
(whistle blows)

14:12.540 --> 14:15.420
Yes! Nice one, Kira!

14:18.540 --> 14:20.420
Keep up with Kira, guys.

14:20.420 --> 14:21.580
Hit her pace.

14:21.580 --> 14:24.750
Come on. What's gonna happen
when I'm not holding back?

14:28.830 --> 14:30.210
Denied.

14:30.210 --> 14:31.580
At least try next time.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.080
Offense. Reset.
Top of the key.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.080
Kira:
Hit me. I'm wide open.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.830
That's it!
Nice one, Maria.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.790
Whoo, Buffy!

14:45.790 --> 14:49.670
You were right.
This team is a hot mess.

15:03.620 --> 15:04.920
(giggling)

15:04.920 --> 15:07.290
So what do you think
of AndiShack?

15:11.540 --> 15:13.330
Libby:
This is beautiful!

15:13.330 --> 15:14.500
Andi: Beautiful?

15:14.500 --> 15:15.920
I know, right?

15:15.920 --> 15:17.790
Libby:
I could never be sad here.

15:17.790 --> 15:19.250
Andi:
Could never be sad?

15:19.250 --> 15:22.170
Oh, well.
I've been sad here.

15:22.170 --> 15:24.460
Libby:
About Jonah?

15:24.460 --> 15:28.000
Is that how you say Jonah?
J Dimple?

15:28.000 --> 15:29.830
(Andi giggles)

15:29.830 --> 15:32.620
Libby:
Why did you two break up?

15:34.420 --> 15:36.460
We didn't really
break up.

15:36.460 --> 15:39.500
We just agreed we were
better as friends.

15:39.500 --> 15:42.170
He's a really great guy.

15:43.330 --> 15:45.170
I shouldn't say anything.

15:45.170 --> 15:46.210
Libby:
Please.

15:46.210 --> 15:47.830
It was a non-event.

15:47.830 --> 15:48.920
Libby:
Please.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.500
I can't.
I really like Jonah.

15:56.460 --> 15:58.330
We didn't have a lot
to talk about.

16:00.620 --> 16:02.830
He does prefer emojis.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.170
He's very cute.

16:07.170 --> 16:08.330
Libby:
Cute!

16:08.330 --> 16:09.790
(giggling)

16:09.790 --> 16:11.580
Ooh! Try that one on.

16:17.790 --> 16:19.380
I didn't know
you were coming in.

16:19.380 --> 16:21.380
Your father made this.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.880
I need your honest opinion.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.380
Huh.

16:24.380 --> 16:25.460
Weird, right?

16:25.460 --> 16:27.580
-It's--
-Weird.

16:27.580 --> 16:29.540
He calls it a Creople.

16:29.540 --> 16:32.040
And he's in the garage
making more.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.920
Maybe it's some sort of
art therapy he learned
at the Ashram?

16:34.920 --> 16:37.460
He didn't need
"art therapy" before he left.

16:37.460 --> 16:38.540
Why would he need it now?

16:39.620 --> 16:41.080
Oh, what's that?

16:41.080 --> 16:42.620
I think it's trying
to tell us something.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.540
She's making problems
where there are none?

16:46.540 --> 16:48.120
Now I'm worried
about you.

16:49.670 --> 16:51.710
What happened here?

16:55.290 --> 16:56.750
Bowie happened.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.210
He offered to help out
with some handyman stuff.

16:59.210 --> 17:00.540
And you let him?

17:10.080 --> 17:11.420
Is that swing taken?

17:14.420 --> 17:16.000
How'd you know
I'd be here?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.380
I've been stopping by.

17:18.380 --> 17:20.580
Seeing if I could get you
without your bodyguards.

17:20.580 --> 17:23.080
I'm not supposed to
hang out with you.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.290
I should go.

17:24.290 --> 17:26.580
No, stay.
I'll go.

17:26.580 --> 17:28.080
Can I at least
say I'm sorry first?

17:30.040 --> 17:32.420
I didn't know Reed
was gonna bring a gun.

17:32.420 --> 17:33.750
I wouldn't have gone

17:33.750 --> 17:35.210
and I definitely
wouldn't have brought you.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.000
Now you hate me.

17:40.420 --> 17:41.460
Classic T.J.

17:42.580 --> 17:44.120
Anything good,
I gotta ruin it.

17:47.210 --> 17:48.420
T.J.

17:49.580 --> 17:52.040
You said you were
gonna apologize.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.460
I just did.

17:53.460 --> 17:54.750
Actually, you didn't.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.790
Yes I did.
I said I was--

17:58.580 --> 17:59.710
Huh. You're right.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.830
Well, sorry for not
saying sorry.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.960
So, you've apologized
for not apologizing.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.620
But you still haven't
apologized.

18:09.620 --> 18:12.120
You can be a little annoying,
you know that?

18:12.120 --> 18:14.670
Well, you can be oblivious.

18:14.670 --> 18:16.250
Well, you can be
very judgey.

18:16.250 --> 18:17.540
Well, you can be
intimidating.

18:17.540 --> 18:19.960
-You know what else you are?
-What?

18:19.960 --> 18:22.170
The only person I can
talk to like this.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.290
Okay if I stay?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.670
So, what are
we gonna do

18:37.670 --> 18:40.000
to whip these slackers
into shape?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.380
That's not why
I wanted to talk.

18:42.380 --> 18:43.670
Then, what's up?

18:43.670 --> 18:45.000
It's...

18:46.210 --> 18:48.830
You are an amazing
ball player, Kira.

18:48.830 --> 18:51.250
Just between us,
that was barely my B game.

18:51.250 --> 18:53.250
No doubt.

18:53.250 --> 18:55.210
But I need you
to adjust your attitude.

18:55.210 --> 18:56.250
My attitude?

18:57.330 --> 18:59.040
What's wrong
with my attitude?

18:59.040 --> 19:01.250
Well, you're not really
being a team player.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.790
Excuse me?
I am the team.

19:03.790 --> 19:05.330
You just heard
yourself, right?

19:05.330 --> 19:06.960
Yeah,
and I heard you too

19:06.960 --> 19:08.880
when you called
your team a hot mess.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.920
That was a mistake.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.250
I shouldn't have said that.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.880
You're the one
who needs to adjust
her attitude, not me.

19:15.830 --> 19:17.460
This isn't going to work.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.330
What's that?

19:20.210 --> 19:21.460
I can't have you
on the team.

19:22.710 --> 19:23.750
That's pretty bold...

19:24.830 --> 19:25.920
calling this a team.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.420
You know, it seems
more like a day camp,

19:28.420 --> 19:30.290
where everyone gets a trophy
just for showing up.

19:30.290 --> 19:33.040
-I'm sorry--
-Slayer?

19:33.040 --> 19:34.250
What a joke.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.790
(sighs) Hey.

19:42.790 --> 19:45.170
This one has
yogurt in it, hm?

19:45.170 --> 19:47.790
-That sounds promising.
-Yeah.

19:47.790 --> 19:49.920
Blueberries,
pineapple...

19:49.920 --> 19:51.790
(quieter)
...beets.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.420
-I'm out.
-Ugh.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.750
What's going on here?

19:58.330 --> 20:00.460
-Look, Bex!
-I see, Mom!

20:00.460 --> 20:02.540
-It works!
-Thanks, Dad.

20:02.540 --> 20:03.920
Sure thing, honey.

20:03.920 --> 20:06.330
You said I did
a great job.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.580
I'm sorry.

20:08.580 --> 20:10.830
I just didn't want to
hurt your feelings.

20:10.830 --> 20:15.250
The truth is, is that,
you're great at improvising.
which works for music,

20:15.250 --> 20:17.420
Just not so much
for cabinetry.

20:17.420 --> 20:20.250
I just wanted to help.

20:20.250 --> 20:23.460
Actually, you did.

20:23.460 --> 20:25.580
Mom was a little worried
that even though
Dad is back,

20:25.580 --> 20:27.750
he still hasn't
completely found himself.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.290
She doesn't look
worried now.

20:30.790 --> 20:35.540
What if I told you
that that was my plan
all along? Hm?

20:35.540 --> 20:37.620
I'd say...

20:37.620 --> 20:39.620
I like your work.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.080
You know what
happened to Reed?

20:52.080 --> 20:54.960
He has to do 100 hours
of community service.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.210
And the police
are investigating his dad.

20:57.210 --> 20:58.250
For what?

20:58.250 --> 21:01.040
Negligent storage
of a firearm.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.750
Whoa.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.620
Seriously.

21:04.620 --> 21:08.330
I just want you to know
it wasn't me who told
the police about the gun.

21:09.460 --> 21:11.120
I would've but
they already knew.

21:11.120 --> 21:13.000
Yeah. I told them.

21:15.250 --> 21:18.080
Surprise!
I did the right thing.

21:26.830 --> 21:29.670
Libby:
I wish I had an AndiShack.

21:29.670 --> 21:32.500
Ooh, I like that,
AndiShack.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.790
Libby:
AndiShack.

21:33.790 --> 21:35.670
Well, my shack is yours.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.670
You're welcome to come
any time.

21:37.670 --> 21:39.000
Libby:
Thank you.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.580
(phone vibrates)

21:42.670 --> 21:43.830
Both:
Jonah.

21:45.380 --> 21:46.880
Libby:
He's looking for us.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.210
He's looking for us
because we're late.

21:49.210 --> 21:50.210
Libby:
For what?

21:50.210 --> 21:51.460
He's worried.

21:51.460 --> 21:52.670
Libby:
About what?

21:52.670 --> 21:54.920
He's afraid I'm gonna
say something

21:54.920 --> 21:56.420
to make you
break up with him.

21:56.420 --> 21:58.580
-Libby: You did.
-Andi: I did?

21:59.620 --> 22:01.830
Wait. What?
When?

22:01.830 --> 22:03.380
Libby:
Back in AndiShack.

22:03.380 --> 22:06.120
No, I didn't say anything.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.210
What did I say?

22:07.210 --> 22:09.460
Libby:
"He's cute but he's boring."

22:09.460 --> 22:11.420
I never said
he was boring.

22:11.420 --> 22:13.540
Libby:
But you meant it.

22:13.540 --> 22:16.920
Okay, even if that's
what I meant,

22:16.920 --> 22:18.710
you can't break up
with him.

22:18.710 --> 22:20.040
Libby:
You did.

22:20.040 --> 22:23.120
Yeah, I did. But that's
a whole other story.

22:25.290 --> 22:27.580
Which we don't
have time for.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.290
Look, he is
a really great guy.

22:30.290 --> 22:32.880
Please, don't break up
with him because of
what I said.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.380
Libby:
Sorry.

22:34.380 --> 22:36.830
Don't! You can't!

22:36.830 --> 22:38.830
Seriously, don't
break up with him.

22:38.830 --> 22:40.920
Please. Please!

22:42.080 --> 22:43.920
Jonah. Hi!

22:43.920 --> 22:45.120
What are you guys
talking about?

22:48.120 --> 22:49.580
Umm...

22:56.830 --> 22:58.120
Next on
Andi Mack...

22:59.250 --> 23:01.290
-Agh!
-Three, zero.

23:01.290 --> 23:02.920
It's a massacre!

23:02.920 --> 23:05.170
I just remembered,
I'm supposed to be somewhere.

23:05.170 --> 23:06.710
Are you upset
that I'm winning?

23:06.710 --> 23:08.080
Ooh, I think
he is upset.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.750
That's because you're here,
if you want to know.

23:09.750 --> 23:11.330
-What is it?
-Ask him.

23:11.330 --> 23:12.750
What did you do?

23:12.750 --> 23:14.750
It's been way too long
since we hung out.

23:14.750 --> 23:17.540
This says tomorrow night.

23:17.540 --> 23:19.290
I have plans
tomorrow night.

23:19.290 --> 23:20.500
With who?

23:20.500 --> 23:22.210
Amber's taking me
to a party.

23:22.210 --> 23:23.380
I'm sure you could come.

23:23.380 --> 23:24.540
Buffy:
I don't want to tag along

23:24.540 --> 23:26.210
to a party
I wasn't invited to.
