WEBVTT

00:04.438 --> 00:06.807
Got talked into
buying the big carriage.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.442
That's a lot of carriage,
let me tell you.

00:08.542 --> 00:09.777
- Hmm?
- Two horse powered.

00:09.877 --> 00:11.212
Wow.

00:11.312 --> 00:12.813
Ben Franklin, Sam Adams,

00:12.913 --> 00:15.183
and General Washington himself.

00:15.283 --> 00:16.417
I heard they're in town

00:16.517 --> 00:18.252
for the big
Freemason gathering.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.587
It's the most
illustrious group

00:19.687 --> 00:20.954
of men
in the American colonies.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.790
Oh, to be one of them.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.258
Oh, I think Ben Franklin's

00:24.358 --> 00:25.826
- actually coming over here.
- What?

00:25.926 --> 00:27.728
Laugh, man.
Laugh like I've made a quip.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.531
Higgintoot.

00:30.631 --> 00:31.732
I trust you're well?

00:31.832 --> 00:34.768
Yes, well,
three of my five nephews

00:34.868 --> 00:36.670
survived the winter,
so we're pleased.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.606
Oh, excellent news.
Excellent news.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.508
You know, I was actually
wondering whether

00:40.608 --> 00:43.377
you'd be free to drop by
the Freemason lodge

00:43.477 --> 00:44.878
this Friday at 5:00.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.948
- I could use a man like you.
- Of course.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.151
Ah! Splendid, then.
I'll see you there.

00:50.251 --> 00:53.020
And, uh-- ooh!
Enjoy the view.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.890
Ah, yes.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.160
Knockers.
My favorite.

00:59.260 --> 01:02.062
I wish she had three
instead of two.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.098
Right.

01:04.198 --> 01:06.134
Damn those pesky wedding vows.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.373
Okay, great.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.374
See you tomorrow.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.676
- Thank you.
- Hmm?

01:15.776 --> 01:17.245
Jay, we just got
another booking for the event.

01:17.345 --> 01:18.679
- Yeah1
- Event? What event?

01:18.779 --> 01:20.514
Nothing was run by me
as lady of the house.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.550
Again--
Because you're dead.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.118
But just to bring
everybody up to speed,

01:24.218 --> 01:26.387
we are hosting
a high-end whiskey tasting...

01:26.487 --> 01:28.189
...and so far,

01:28.289 --> 01:29.523
the feedback's been great.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.958
We even got
a writer from <i>Sippr NY</i>

01:31.058 --> 01:33.161
to come review it,
which is huge.

01:33.261 --> 01:35.929
<i>Sippr</i> is like <i>Eater,</i>
but for drinks.

01:36.029 --> 01:38.899
To put it in terms
you still don't understand.

01:38.999 --> 01:42.102
Well, I don't like that
the event promotes alcohol use.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.604
Said the cocaine fiend.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.573
But I do like your description
of it as high-end.

01:45.673 --> 01:46.974
Sounds snooty. Well done.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.010
Oh, hold on.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.513
It's crazy you can publicize
a drinking event.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.148
In my day,
when folks were boozing,

01:54.248 --> 01:55.549
you didn't know if you were
going to get arrested,

01:55.649 --> 01:58.619
get shot or go blind.

01:58.719 --> 02:02.089
Ooh-whee! It was fun.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.391
Are you sure?

02:03.491 --> 02:07.228
Okay. Uh, well,
uh, thanks, I guess.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.929
Bad news, babe.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.131
Um, you know
how I was supposed to secure

02:11.232 --> 02:12.766
the liquor license
before the B and B opened?

02:12.866 --> 02:14.435
Might want to get down here!

02:14.535 --> 02:16.003
Sam and Jay are
about to have a fight.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.438
Well, I forgot.

02:17.538 --> 02:20.408
But then, in kind
of a hero move,

02:20.508 --> 02:22.343
last week,
I realized that I forgot.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.077
Jay, the whiskey tasting
is tomorrow.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.947
Which is why I have been
hounding the liquor board

02:27.047 --> 02:29.483
to expedite the process,
and that was them.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.385
And they said
that the earliest

02:31.485 --> 02:33.454
that they can come
to do an inspection

02:33.554 --> 02:35.189
is eight weeks from now.

02:35.289 --> 02:38.091
No. We've been serving
alcohol for months.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.060
Welcome drinks,
wine pairings with dinner.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.563
Wait, we have
been doing it for months,

02:42.663 --> 02:44.097
and we haven't been caught.

02:44.198 --> 02:45.366
So what's one more day?

02:45.466 --> 02:47.435
Yes. Jay, I like your style.

02:47.535 --> 02:50.771
If we cancel on the <i>Sippr</i> guy,
he may never come back.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.873
We'll be blowing
a huge opportunity.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.008
As the wife of a robber baron,

02:55.108 --> 02:58.946
if I might just add,
sometimes one must skirt the law

02:59.046 --> 03:00.814
to advance
one's own business.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.450
This is nuts.
Serving alcohol

03:02.550 --> 03:04.418
without a license
is a criminal offense.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.019
What are the ghosts saying?

03:06.119 --> 03:07.555
Well, Hetty's saying
sometimes you need

03:07.655 --> 03:08.756
to bend the law in business,

03:08.856 --> 03:10.190
and Pete's arguing against.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.227
And whose mansion
are we standing in right now?

03:13.327 --> 03:14.462
Okay, I had a three-bedroom

03:14.562 --> 03:16.264
in a very good
school district.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.432
I guess it's just
one more day.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.101
Yes, Sam!
Let's break the damn law.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.239
And please enjoy
this cheese platter

03:25.339 --> 03:27.040
while we wait for the other
guests to arrive.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.842
Thank you so much.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.878
Uh, Sam, why are we wasting
space on almonds?

03:30.978 --> 03:33.514
We need pungent.
Where's the Roquefort?

03:35.316 --> 03:36.450
Who are the young folk?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.719
Ah, they're here
for the whiskey tasting.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.588
She's an art history major,
and he's a frat guy

03:40.688 --> 03:42.089
trying to prove
he's not a douche

03:42.189 --> 03:43.657
by bringing her
to this classy event.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.926
I am tired of people
stereotyping frat dudes.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.395
We are just as refined
as the next guy.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.730
Babe, check it out.

03:49.830 --> 03:50.998
Frog testicles.

03:51.098 --> 03:53.434
Yes, he's a remarkable
young man.

03:53.534 --> 03:57.438
Damn, I miss my frat days.
Great friends, epic parties.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.139
Isaac knows
what I'm talking about.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.174
- He was a Freemason.
- What's a Freemason?

04:01.275 --> 04:04.312
We were the original
fraternal organization.

04:04.412 --> 04:08.148
Ben Franklin,
George Washington, Samuel Adams

04:08.248 --> 04:09.850
were counted
amongst our membership.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.619
It was, like,
crazy exclusive.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.020
The kid who played
Chunk in <i>Goonies</i>

04:13.120 --> 04:15.523
was in my pledge class,
so I get it.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.791
Here's an idea.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.460
What if we started
our own fraternity?

04:19.560 --> 04:20.894
A ghost fraternity?

04:20.994 --> 04:23.731
- Oh, hell yes!
- A ghost fraternity?

04:23.831 --> 04:25.499
Okay, but how is that
any different than all of us

04:25.599 --> 04:27.401
just hanging out
like we always do?

04:27.501 --> 04:29.803
Because a fraternity
has rituals and traditions.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.305
And a cool
secret handshake!

04:31.405 --> 04:32.973
Yes.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.442
Also, it's slightly different

04:34.542 --> 04:35.876
than what we do
every other day.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.546
Yeah!
Anything different is good.

04:38.646 --> 04:39.647
Okay, fine. I'm in.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.215
Flower, what do you say?

04:42.316 --> 04:44.685
I forget what we were
talking about.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.854
It's just like
doing bong hits with Chunk.

04:46.954 --> 04:50.057
I love it.
This frat's gonna be amazing!

04:51.925 --> 04:53.461
Is that the guy from <i>Sippr?</i>

04:53.561 --> 04:56.296
Yep, and he is making
love to that whiskey.

04:56.397 --> 04:57.731
So what do you think?

04:57.831 --> 05:01.569
Notes of vanilla, dried fruit,

05:01.669 --> 05:03.771
a playful offering
with which to start.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.305
Uh...

05:05.406 --> 05:08.075
If you'll excuse me,
I'll be right back.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.713
- Hi. Jay Arondekar?
- Yes.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.816
My name's Sherry. I'm with the
Hudson Valley Liquor Authority.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.051
Sam, we're being raided.
Toilet, sink or drink.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.720
You got to get rid
of the hooch.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.422
I'm here
to inspect your property

05:21.522 --> 05:22.890
for a liquor license.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.958
Oh.
I thought you couldn't come

05:25.058 --> 05:26.360
for, like, eight weeks.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.961
Well, today is your lucky day.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.497
I had a cancellation
and was told you folks

05:29.597 --> 05:31.499
are in a bit
of a time crunch.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.166
Now isn't exactly
the best time,

05:33.266 --> 05:35.268
so maybe you could come back,
like, say, tomorrow?

05:35.369 --> 05:36.737
Once we arrive,
if we're denied entry,

05:36.837 --> 05:39.407
- it's an automatic fail.
- Meaning...

05:39.507 --> 05:41.842
You'll have to wait a year
before you reapply.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.712
Okay, uh, would you
just hold on one moment?

05:44.812 --> 05:46.847
- No, wait-- What?
- Thanks.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.216
This is not good.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.118
We can't be without
a liquor license for a year.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.986
We have to get
the guests out of here.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.255
Wow. I guess someone's wishing
they listened to the fellow

05:55.355 --> 05:57.224
with the modest house
after all, huh?

05:57.324 --> 05:59.693
What are we gonna do? Are we
gonna kick out the <i>Sippr</i> guy?

05:59.793 --> 06:01.862
Can you imagine
the review he'll write?

06:01.962 --> 06:02.963
He'll shred us.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.231
- I have an idea.
- What?

06:04.331 --> 06:05.232
I said, "He'll shred us."

06:05.332 --> 06:06.834
I was talking to Alberta.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.437
Okay, well, you can see how
it's confusing, though, right?

06:09.537 --> 06:11.371
Well, you have a bunch of booze

06:11.472 --> 06:12.706
and a bunch of thirsty customers

06:12.806 --> 06:15.242
with Johnny Law
breathing down your neck.

06:15.342 --> 06:18.345
And you also have a secret room
with a hidden entrance.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.748
What are you saying, Alberta?

06:20.848 --> 06:22.950
Girl, I'm saying
let's do a damn speakeasy.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.318
Alberta's suggesting
that we sneak our guests

06:25.419 --> 06:27.020
into the vault
and call it a speakeasy.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.922
That's a great idea.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.525
It's cool, it's down
a secret passageway.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.226
That's what I'm saying!

06:33.326 --> 06:34.895
We could sell it as part

06:34.995 --> 06:36.864
of the whiskey tasting
experience, make it our theme.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.999
I strongly advise against this.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.634
You're gonna run
a speakeasy in the house

06:40.734 --> 06:42.169
while that woman
is performing inspections?

06:42.269 --> 06:43.170
This is crazy.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.806
Yes, Pete, apparently we are.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.941
Ooh, all right, Sam!
You won't regret it.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.010
Yeah, unless they get
fined, arrested,

06:50.110 --> 06:51.278
or put out of business.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.613
Either way, it's gonna be

06:52.713 --> 06:55.182
a wild night.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.256
- What's going on?
- It's 1928,

07:03.356 --> 07:04.692
and Johnny Law
is hot on our tails.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.560
Oh, is this like
a speakeasy thing?

07:06.660 --> 07:09.997
Yes, exactly. And as long as you
know the password-- um, uh...

07:11.031 --> 07:12.199
Arrow... nerd.

07:12.299 --> 07:14.334
Pretty sure Arrow
would have sufficed.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.435
Then you can come on in.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.437
- Arrow nerd.
- You're in.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.839
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.309
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

07:27.047 --> 07:30.518
So, uh, how long do you think
this is going to take?

07:30.618 --> 07:32.920
Well, I need to check
the common spaces,

07:33.020 --> 07:35.523
make sure there are an
appropriate number of egresses,

07:35.623 --> 07:38.458
look at the general
sanitary conditions,

07:38.559 --> 07:41.328
ensure there's no pest feces
or active infestations.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.463
Cool.
So, like, ten or 15 minutes?

07:43.564 --> 07:45.465
This is going to take
several hours, sir.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.636
Ooh, the Paper Mate 98 ball pen?

07:48.736 --> 07:50.804
Oh, this gal means business.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.706
That baby glides.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.274
Ooh. Yeah.

07:54.374 --> 07:56.276
You've all been chosen
as members

07:56.376 --> 07:57.811
of the inaugural class

07:57.911 --> 08:01.114
of the very exclusive
ghost fraternity.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.783
What makes it exclusive?

08:02.883 --> 08:04.518
Pete and Alberta
aren't in it.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.386
Didn't they choose
not to be in it?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.622
Be that as it may,
they're out.

08:08.722 --> 08:11.424
Now, you may be wondering,
what is a frat?

08:11.525 --> 08:13.894
And the answer is
an organization that promotes

08:13.994 --> 08:15.228
high-minded conversations

08:15.328 --> 08:17.164
about philosophy,
poetry and ethics.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.332
What?
No, it's not that at all.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.869
It's about binge drinking,
taking drugs,

08:21.969 --> 08:24.104
and doing one day of charity
every three years.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.639
But, Trevor, we're ghosts.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.541
We can't do
any of those things.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.810
Okay, fine, but we don't
have to be lame.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.946
We can do fun stuff,
like jumping off the roof.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.948
Yes!

08:35.048 --> 08:36.449
Like <i>ättestupa.</i>

08:36.550 --> 08:38.919
In Viking society,
when old people

08:39.019 --> 08:40.988
no longer able
to support themselves,

08:41.088 --> 08:42.590
we throw them off cliff.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.592
Is very fun.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.493
Just every story, man,

08:46.594 --> 08:48.328
- it just keeps getting darker.
- Yeah.

08:48.428 --> 08:51.732
Wouldn't everyone prefer
to plumb the depths

08:51.832 --> 08:54.001
of human knowledge
and learn timeless lessons

08:54.101 --> 08:57.504
about morality,
like we did in the Freemasons?

08:57.605 --> 08:59.472
Look, guys, I think
we have different visions

08:59.573 --> 09:01.041
of this thing,
which is fine.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.843
Doesn't mean that one's
better than the other.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.545
Just means that you should
start your own frat.

09:05.646 --> 09:08.248
And I'll do the cool one.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.450
So...

09:10.550 --> 09:11.785
how's it going down here?

09:11.885 --> 09:13.754
A completely
immersive experience

09:13.854 --> 09:15.723
to go along
with the tasting. Well done.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.725
And the fake corpse--
That's a nice touch.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.493
Look, I can make him
pick his nose.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.931
- That's great, Blane.
- Oh, they're being so loud.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.600
The inspector's going to hear.
This is so nerve-racking.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.702
Pete, this is living!

09:28.802 --> 09:30.938
Didn't you ever color
outside the lines?

09:31.038 --> 09:32.606
Well, one time
I was late for a movie,

09:32.706 --> 09:34.474
so I parked
in a loading zone.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.509
It was a Sunday,
so it was probably allowed,

09:36.610 --> 09:38.712
but, man, it ruined
<i>Gremlins</i> for me.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.981
We lived very different
lives, Pete Martino.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.351
Thor-Finn, Thor-Finn, Thor-Finn!

09:44.451 --> 09:45.686
Jump, Thor!

09:45.786 --> 09:47.888
Now that Thor up here, it, uh...

09:47.988 --> 09:49.256
seems pretty high.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.324
Starting to feel bad

09:51.424 --> 09:52.960
for old people
we throw off cliff.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.763
You're a ghost.
You'll be fine.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.397
Oh.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.333
Is this stove
properly ventilated?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.402
Yes, I would assume it is.

10:02.502 --> 10:04.471
Well, you'd be surprised.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.473
A lot of these older homes
have renovations

10:06.573 --> 10:08.441
that were done
without proper permitting.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.310
Oh, my God!

10:10.410 --> 10:13.080
Improper permitting, you say?

10:13.180 --> 10:15.615
Yes, it's a real problem.

10:17.517 --> 10:20.053
- Thor rules!
- Oh, my God!

10:20.153 --> 10:22.923
Best fraternity ever! Yes!

10:24.624 --> 10:26.694
I'll be right back.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.763
- Arrow nerd.
- Excuse me?

10:29.863 --> 10:32.265
Our buddy texted us
about a speakeasy here.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.301
Oh, yeah, that's not
actually happening anymore.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.803
But he just texted us.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.405
- Hey, yo, Blane!
- Okay, okay.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.539
It was a test.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.874
And you passed,

10:40.974 --> 10:42.810
so shut up,
follow me, quietly.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.653
"Any moment might be our last,

10:53.754 --> 10:55.923
everything is more beautiful
because we are doomed."

10:56.023 --> 10:57.858
Anyone know from where
those words come?

10:57.958 --> 11:00.127
- My worst nightmare?
- No.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.595
It's <i>The Iliad!</i>

11:02.696 --> 11:04.965
This is the point
of a fraternal organization.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.400
The Freemasons sought
to build moral character

11:07.500 --> 11:09.069
through study of the classics.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.171
"The classics."

11:11.271 --> 11:14.842
Hey, what's going on
lame-da, lame-da, lame-da?

11:14.942 --> 11:17.644
- We're going to party in vault!
- You guys should come.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.780
No, rest assured,
we're quite fine in here.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.181
Suit yourself.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.616
Lame-da!

11:24.952 --> 11:28.555
Okay, where were we?
Ah, yes.

11:28.655 --> 11:29.923
Throwing a party of our own.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.792
- I can't do this, man.
- What?

11:31.892 --> 11:33.693
Look, I joined your frat
'cause I hate siding

11:33.794 --> 11:36.229
with Trevor
on basically anything, but...

11:36.329 --> 11:38.065
I just gotta get out of here.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.703
Well, it's just
you and me, then.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.539
That was so rude of Sasappis

11:46.639 --> 11:48.041
just to leave us
here like that.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.878
I think I should go give him
a piece of my mind.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.280
- You just want to go
to the party, don't you?
- Desperately.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.783
Thank you for understanding. Oh!

11:57.818 --> 12:00.253
HVU!

12:00.353 --> 12:02.622
- Go, Turtles!
- Man, these guys can drink.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.624
I had two light beers
in college one night.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.960
Woke up in a trash heap
in northern Nevada.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.495
Ooh!

12:09.296 --> 12:12.432
Oh, well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.301
Yes, fine.
We got bored. You win.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.804
Go ahead, do that weird
gesture with your hands

12:16.904 --> 12:19.973
- where you make a little "T."
- T-Money! Yeah, that one?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.775
- Ugh.
- Ugh. Good.
Get it out of your system.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.743
Wait. Where's Isaac?

12:23.844 --> 12:25.813
Oh, uh, he's, uh,
still at the frat meeting.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.215
You left him
at the meeting alone?

12:28.315 --> 12:31.218
- Yes, and we feel
awful about it.
- Mm-hmm.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.920
Tiny hot dogs.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.188
Oh, they smell just as good
as the big boys.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.926
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.393
So how's it going up there?

12:40.493 --> 12:42.529
Slow. That lady is thorough.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.031
How's <i>Sippr</i> guy
enjoying himself?

12:44.131 --> 12:45.866
He thinks
that the high-end whiskey

12:45.966 --> 12:48.335
that we're serving him
isn't "special."

12:48.435 --> 12:50.037
Uh, Sam, if I may,

12:50.137 --> 12:51.738
I know where
you can get a whiskey

12:51.839 --> 12:53.874
that will knock
this man's socks off.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.376
- Am I holding for ghosts?
- Yup.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.311
My bootlegger boyfriend
stored booze upstairs

12:58.411 --> 13:00.347
- the night I performed.
- Do you think it's still there?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.883
Oh, I know it is.
I'll take you right to it.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.618
Okay. Hey, uh, Elliot.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.256
Uh, how would you like to try
Prohibition-era whiskey

13:09.356 --> 13:12.659
stashed on this property
100 years ago by bootleggers?

13:12.759 --> 13:14.161
I would like
to try that very much.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.229
Great. Wait here
and we'll be right back.

13:16.329 --> 13:19.032
Uh, there is just
one little problem.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.869
- It's in the wall.
- Seriously?

13:21.969 --> 13:23.170
Damn it.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.044
Jay, Alberta said the
whiskey is still in the wall.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.712
Mm-hmm.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.214
Yep, it's still there.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.983
Oh, my precious booze.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.450
And also a possum skeleton.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.786
He died years before
you guys moved in.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.421
Cute little guy.
You know, pre-rotting.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.991
All right, I'm all done
with my inspection.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.792
- Everything looks good.
- Oh!

13:45.893 --> 13:47.360
Great. So you're leaving?

13:47.460 --> 13:50.563
Yup, just as soon as I fill out
the requisite paperwork.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.465
Okay if I set up shop
in the kitchen?

13:52.565 --> 13:55.802
Uh... Why don't you use
the library?

13:55.903 --> 13:59.272
- It's more comfortable.
- Or the upstairs den.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.141
Very end of the hall. Quiet.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.843
No, the kitchen's fine.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.014
This is insane.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.182
There's no way we can break
a hole in this wall

14:09.282 --> 14:11.184
without Sherry hearing us.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.819
Okay, I have an idea.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.654
We <i>Shawshank</i> it.

14:15.889 --> 14:18.491
<i>Shawshank Redemption.</i>
The movie.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.894
- I still haven't seen it.
- Seriously?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.829
- Sam, it's on, like,
four times a day.
- Okay.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.864
In that movie, the main guy,
Andy Dufresne,

14:24.965 --> 14:26.733
he escapes from prison
by crawling through a pipe,

14:26.833 --> 14:28.601
and what he does is
he waits for a storm,

14:28.701 --> 14:30.603
and then he uses the cracks
of thunder to cover up

14:30.703 --> 14:32.973
when he hits the pipe
with a rock.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.508
So you're saying
we should wait for a storm?

14:35.608 --> 14:40.713
No, babe, I'm saying
we make our own storm.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.851
Is anyone else
turned on right now?

14:44.952 --> 14:46.219
A little.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.290
This woman is a machine!
Working in pen,

14:50.390 --> 14:52.359
no cross-outs, really focused.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.061
Oh, Jay looks like
he's gearing up, Sam.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.662
Oh, don't mind me.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.764
I'm just gonna
tenderize a little meat.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.232
No problem.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.368
And now!

15:03.303 --> 15:04.471
And now!

15:07.740 --> 15:09.209
And now!

15:11.544 --> 15:15.248
Oh, that's a beefy rib-eye.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.351
Oh, my God.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.522
Ooh-whee! Yes.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.992
That's some sweet Kentucky
bath water.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.760
Mm, and one nasty-ass possum.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.601
Hey, I've been
looking for you, bud.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.503
I suppose you've come to gloat

15:36.603 --> 15:38.505
about your fraternity
vanquishing mine.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.274
No, I came
to invite you downstairs.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.210
It may not be
a Masonic lodge,

15:43.310 --> 15:45.245
but speakeasy's pretty cool.

15:45.345 --> 15:46.913
And we missed you.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.882
Well, the truth is,
I wouldn't even know

15:49.983 --> 15:52.552
what the inside
of a Masonic lodge looked like.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.287
What are you talking about?

15:54.387 --> 15:55.989
Was it all freaky
blindfolded stuff?

15:56.089 --> 15:57.790
No, Trevor.

15:57.890 --> 16:02.862
Despite my claims, I never
actually was a Freemason.

16:04.864 --> 16:07.034
Wow!

16:07.134 --> 16:10.803
I had heard the rumors,
but that is a big carriage.

16:10.903 --> 16:13.540
Well, it doesn't get
the best miles per bale of hay,

16:13.640 --> 16:14.974
but, uh, she sure is roomy.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.309
Indeed. Indeed.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.745
And a good thing too, Higgintoot,

16:18.845 --> 16:20.847
because I've invited you
here today

16:20.947 --> 16:23.150
because I would like you

16:23.250 --> 16:25.152
to take a large oak desk

16:25.252 --> 16:26.853
to John Jay's house.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.257
You mean...
You mean after the meeting?

16:30.357 --> 16:31.958
After the...

16:32.059 --> 16:34.194
Oh, dear.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.063
You thought I was inviting you

16:36.163 --> 16:38.231
to the Freemasons meeting.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.968
Oh...
I mean, I... I mean, no.

16:42.069 --> 16:44.771
Look, after John Jay's,
why don't you come back?

16:44.871 --> 16:46.139
Really?

16:46.239 --> 16:49.742
Oh, darn it!
I've done it again, haven't I?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.445
I simply meant in case
any of the Freemasons

16:52.545 --> 16:53.846
needed a ride home.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.882
I am sorry.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.921
So, when I got the chance
to start my own fraternity,

17:02.021 --> 17:04.091
I decided to turn it
into the Freemasons,

17:04.191 --> 17:05.492
so I could finally belong.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.528
But here I am,
rejected once again.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.530
They didn't reject you today.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.831
They rejected being
in the Freemasons,

17:11.931 --> 17:13.433
Which makes sense,
'cause it seems

17:13.533 --> 17:14.934
like the Freemasons
kind of sucked.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.504
And Ben Franklin--
I hate to say this,

17:17.604 --> 17:18.771
as a Penn guy--
sounds like a dick.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.341
He was a bit full of himself.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.510
Although,
he did discover electricity.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.778
Like they weren't gonna
find that.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.381
Look, I didn't get
into my first choice frat,

17:28.481 --> 17:29.749
but the guys I ended up with

17:29.849 --> 17:31.351
turned out to be
my best friends.

17:31.451 --> 17:34.020
Didn't one of them dump
your dead body into a lake?

17:34.121 --> 17:37.957
The point is, you may not
have chosen us ghosts,

17:38.057 --> 17:39.626
but you're here now,

17:39.726 --> 17:41.461
and we're lucky to have you.

17:42.629 --> 17:43.763
Thank you, Trevor.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.765
You know, there's a statue

17:45.865 --> 17:47.667
of Ben Franklin
on campus at Penn,

17:47.767 --> 17:49.001
him sitting on a bench.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.337
Ugh, of course there is.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.239
Why are you telling me this?

17:52.339 --> 17:53.506
Because every weekend,

17:53.606 --> 17:55.442
kids get drunk
and pee all over it.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.210
Oh.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.579
Oh, Trevor...

18:00.680 --> 18:02.715
What a gift you've given me.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.652
So, what do you think?

18:05.752 --> 18:08.288
I have never
had anything like it.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.390
I feel like I've been training
my whole life for this.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.858
Cheers.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.094
Little tip, Sam.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.996
You and Jay wait
20 minutes before drinking it,

18:17.096 --> 18:18.865
see if any of these folks
go blind.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.802
I can't believe it.
We pass our inspection,

18:22.902 --> 18:24.671
we nail the whiskey tasting.

18:24.771 --> 18:25.938
Are we great business people?

18:26.038 --> 18:28.608
We might be.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.944
Oh, what a night.
That was fun.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.746
I gotta admit,
I was nervous at first,

18:33.846 --> 18:35.715
but then I started to,
you know, get into it.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.218
Ooh, see?
Being bad feels pretty good.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.686
- Doesn't it?
- It was exciting.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.954
That's why you gotta take
risks every now and then.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.791
Yeah, you're right.
You're totally right.

18:44.891 --> 18:47.160
Pete, you spent your whole life
being afraid.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.096
Don't make that same mistake
in your afterlife.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.199
Just go for it.

18:52.299 --> 18:53.800
Okay.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.636
Whoa!

18:57.670 --> 19:01.308
Okay. You're gonna see
this as a defeat,

19:01.408 --> 19:03.976
but this is a proud moment
for you,

19:04.076 --> 19:06.446
and I want you
to acknowledge that.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.047
Okay, I feel... I feel proud.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.849
Good.

19:15.054 --> 19:18.925
Hey, to the ghost frat
and its founding member,

19:19.025 --> 19:20.693
Isaac Higgintoot.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.529
Huzzah!

19:22.629 --> 19:24.096
Yeah!

19:26.065 --> 19:29.135
What an event.
I mean, hats off to you both.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.871
Someone is gonna get
a very nice review in <i>Sippr.</i>

19:31.971 --> 19:33.640
That's great. Uh, thank you.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.174
I mean,
I really don't understand

19:35.275 --> 19:36.743
your business model at all.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.445
Just giving away $5,000 bottles
of vintage whiskey,

19:38.545 --> 19:40.513
but I am not complaining.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.518
Did he say $5,000?

19:46.986 --> 19:50.189
- Yeah!
- <i>Can't get enough... ♪</i>

19:50.290 --> 19:53.660
Are we bad business people?

19:53.760 --> 19:55.695
We might be.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.935
You know, I think it's smart

20:03.035 --> 20:04.371
you're saving a little money
doing this yourselves.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.538
Totally.
Now we're only 30 grand down

20:05.638 --> 20:07.740
from the whole whiskey thing.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.676
Hey, wait a minute.

20:09.776 --> 20:10.943
What is this?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.078
It's a letter.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.146
Does possum have pen pal?

20:14.247 --> 20:15.582
Open it up, Sam.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.517
"My dearest Earl..."

20:17.617 --> 20:19.786
That was
my bootlegger boyfriend.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.255
The letter must
have fallen out of the crate.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.223
"I can't wait for us
to be together

20:24.324 --> 20:25.892
once we get rid
of you-know-who."

20:25.992 --> 20:27.494
Signed, T.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.728
"Get rid of...?"

20:28.828 --> 20:30.463
Sam. This might have
something to do

20:30.563 --> 20:33.633
- with Alberta's murder.
- Did Earl knock me off?

20:33.733 --> 20:36.703
Or maybe it was T.
But who the hell is T?

20:36.803 --> 20:40.139
Samantha, fire up
that podcast machine.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.775
We've got two new suspects.
