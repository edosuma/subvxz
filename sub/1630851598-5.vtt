WEBVTT

00:06.794 --> 00:08.072
Dude, did you ever
collect baseball

00:08.147 --> 00:09.592
or basketball cards as a kid?

00:09.667 --> 00:11.479
A little bit.
Why?

00:11.554 --> 00:13.112
I wish we had Frogger cards.

00:13.187 --> 00:15.632
Like, I would totally trade you
a Jazzy Long Legs rookie

00:15.707 --> 00:18.792
for a Frogfather limited edition
chrome graded PSA10.

00:18.867 --> 00:21.112
Wait, are you serious right now?

00:21.187 --> 00:23.432
That's like trading a
Michael Jordan rookie card

00:23.507 --> 00:24.992
for a Kurt Rambis.

00:25.001 --> 00:26.712
So, do we have a trade?

00:26.787 --> 00:28.832
No, dude, we don't even have
actual Frogger cards made up.

00:28.907 --> 00:30.359
What--

00:30.434 --> 00:31.712
Well, could you just give me
the Michael Jordan rookie

00:31.787 --> 00:33.312
and we'll just call it even?

00:33.387 --> 00:34.559
No, Kyle.

00:34.634 --> 00:37.312
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

00:37.387 --> 00:39.672
Answering the call
of the wild tonight,

00:39.747 --> 00:41.152
[flatulence]

00:41.227 --> 00:42.152
I hate that guy.

00:42.227 --> 00:45.112
Six Amazonian challengers...

00:45.187 --> 00:46.152
Oh!

00:46.227 --> 00:47.312
That's gonna bruise.

00:47.387 --> 00:50.072
Take on three
killer crossings.

00:50.147 --> 00:51.792
Oh, no!

00:51.867 --> 00:53.112
Just flicked her off
like a booger.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.952
As they attempt
to level up

00:55.027 --> 00:57.352
to the Boss Toad Bonus Round.

00:57.427 --> 00:59.912
Who will slide right
out of the game?

00:59.921 --> 01:01.992
Like a piece of butter
sliding off a knife.

01:02.001 --> 01:05.879
Who will win the majestic
$10,000 Golden Fanny Pack?

01:05.954 --> 01:07.752
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.

01:07.827 --> 01:10.952
And how did the ants get in
this Frogger's pants?

01:11.027 --> 01:12.312
Whoa, what is that?

01:12.387 --> 01:13.879
[calls]

01:13.954 --> 01:16.552
- I'm Damon Wayans Jr.
- I'm Kyle Brandt.

01:16.627 --> 01:18.839
And this is "Frogger."

01:24.147 --> 01:25.912
It's real life,
it's larger than life,

01:25.987 --> 01:28.752
and for one Frogger,
it will change their life.

01:28.827 --> 01:32.552
Six mighty warriors are about
to do battle in the craziest

01:32.627 --> 01:34.592
real-life video game ever.

01:34.667 --> 01:38.912
All for the chance to take home
a beautiful '80s fashion item,

01:38.987 --> 01:41.472
a Golden Fanny Pack with
$10,000 cash inside.

01:41.547 --> 01:44.112
$10,000 bucks could make a big
difference in somebody's life.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.192
Absolutely, and the fanny pack
could make a real difference

01:46.201 --> 01:48.399
to their future
wardrobe decisions, too.

01:48.474 --> 01:50.272
So what's our first
crossing tonight, Kyle?

01:50.281 --> 01:53.312
I hope our two Froggers are
ready for the flowing waters

01:53.387 --> 01:56.032
of Ribbit River.

01:56.107 --> 01:58.512
Froggers must pass the powerful
jets of the waterfall.

01:58.521 --> 02:01.352
Then call for the turtles and
jump a rid to the logs

02:01.361 --> 02:04.152
or take a tough short-cut
through the spinning lilies.

02:04.227 --> 02:06.999
Once they've traversed
the up and down loco lilies,

02:07.074 --> 02:09.232
Froggers ride the gators
and scale the rocks

02:09.307 --> 02:12.112
before swinging home
to the landing pad.

02:12.121 --> 02:13.952
Both of these Froggers
are teachers.

02:14.027 --> 02:15.432
- Oh my...
- Oh my God!

02:15.507 --> 02:17.879
So for me the winner is going
to be whoever learns

02:17.954 --> 02:20.272
the most lessons
on the crossing.

02:20.347 --> 02:22.312
Aw...

02:22.321 --> 02:23.872
Paige versus Genesis...

02:23.947 --> 02:25.592
It is New York
versus L.A.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.359
East Coast versus West Coast.

02:27.434 --> 02:28.319
Let's get it on!

02:30.187 --> 02:32.232
My name is Paige,
I'm 29 years old,

02:32.307 --> 02:34.752
from Brooklyn New York,
and I'm a science teacher.

02:34.827 --> 02:36.792
I get really, really excited

02:36.867 --> 02:39.112
when I'm doing anything
in chemistry.

02:39.187 --> 02:42.232
I often sing and dance
while I'm teaching the class.

02:42.307 --> 02:44.992
Being a role model for
young women in science,

02:45.067 --> 02:46.879
it is absolutely amazing.

02:46.954 --> 02:48.832
I am all about chemical reaction

02:48.907 --> 02:50.952
so when you put
Miss Mac with Frogger,

02:51.027 --> 02:52.752
there's going to be
an explosion,

02:52.827 --> 02:54.312
and I'm going to
wipe you out.

02:54.387 --> 02:57.759
Hi, my name is Genesis
Codina, I'm 24 years old,

02:57.834 --> 02:59.392
From Los Angeles, California.

02:59.467 --> 03:02.032
And I'm a special education
teacher and a model.

03:02.107 --> 03:04.352
I love fashion, it's like
a big part of my life.

03:04.427 --> 03:07.512
A lot of people compare
me to Kim Kardashian.

03:07.587 --> 03:09.512
Maybe when I'm totally
glammed up, but

03:09.587 --> 03:11.279
I'm not just a pretty face.

03:11.354 --> 03:13.512
I work with kids
that have a lot of

03:13.587 --> 03:15.112
different types of disabilities.

03:15.187 --> 03:17.152
I just love being the person

03:17.161 --> 03:19.392
to help them grow
and just flourish.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.719
I'm definitely more
brains than beauty,

03:21.794 --> 03:24.152
so Boss Toad, this girl
is coming your way

03:24.227 --> 03:26.719
to kick your butt,
so get ready.

03:28.074 --> 03:30.952
Here we go,
Paige versus Genesis.

03:31.027 --> 03:34.432
And are we on Ribbit River,
or are we on Swan Lake?

03:34.507 --> 03:37.632
Frogger 1, are you ready
to turn the "Paige"

03:37.707 --> 03:38.759
on this competition?

03:38.834 --> 03:39.999
Buh bum, ching!

03:40.074 --> 03:41.152
[laughs]

03:41.227 --> 03:42.952
Here we go!

03:43.027 --> 03:45.512
Paige from New York,
a former All-state gymnast,

03:45.521 --> 03:47.752
welcome to Ribbit River,
let's get it on!

03:47.827 --> 03:49.152
Okay, okay.

03:49.227 --> 03:50.432
Wearing science
all over her pants,

03:50.507 --> 03:52.152
will she be coming up
short on oxygen?

03:52.227 --> 03:55.719
Here we go. These water cannons
are going to feel like lead.

03:55.794 --> 03:57.512
Atomic symbol Pb.

03:57.521 --> 04:00.432
We're just going to try to say
as many elements as we can.

04:00.507 --> 04:01.832
- Copper.
- Copper.

04:01.907 --> 04:04.152
Don't sleep on zinc, either.

04:04.227 --> 04:05.712
Come on, Paige, you can
do it, you can do it!

04:05.787 --> 04:08.552
Hope she doesn't get hit too
hard with this H2O.

04:08.627 --> 04:10.632
- Talk about it! What?
- That's hydrogen

04:10.707 --> 04:11.759
and two oxygen.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.412
Nope, two hydrogen,
one oxygen.

04:13.414 --> 04:15.712
That's what I meant.
That's what I meant.

04:15.787 --> 04:17.399
Here we go.

04:17.474 --> 04:19.992
We got oxygen a-plenty as
we're to the first...

04:20.067 --> 04:22.792
and she's down!

04:22.867 --> 04:25.032
That was elementary,
my dear Wayans.

04:25.107 --> 04:26.039
Wow.

04:26.114 --> 04:27.819
Well, she made a mistake here
of being

04:27.894 --> 04:30.912
right in the face of force
equals mass times acceleration.

04:30.987 --> 04:32.112
That would be physics?

04:32.187 --> 04:34.512
She got sprayed
right in the uranium.

04:34.587 --> 04:36.992
Watch the celebration,
laughter. Oh my gosh.

04:37.067 --> 04:39.992
Genesis is having
a splendid time.

04:40.067 --> 04:42.479
Oh, the spin laugh.
Oh, that felt good.

04:42.554 --> 04:43.872
You don't see a lot of
spin laughs, do you?

04:43.947 --> 04:45.632
No, not lately.

04:45.707 --> 04:47.832
Ready, Frogger 2?

04:47.907 --> 04:49.552
Yes, let's do it.

04:49.627 --> 04:50.992
Here we go.

04:51.067 --> 04:52.879
Another teacher,
teacher on teacher.

04:52.954 --> 04:56.112
Genesis Codina, 23-years-old
from Los Angeles.

04:56.187 --> 04:58.312
Let's hope there's not any
snakes on Ribbit River.

04:58.387 --> 05:01.112
Snakes and Genesis
don't ever end well.

05:01.187 --> 05:03.752
If she can clear these
waterfalls, she will actually

05:03.827 --> 05:05.752
take the lead but
these things are brutal.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.552
Paige in the background,
dancing like a baby.

05:07.561 --> 05:10.792
Paige's appendages become
self-aware when it's dance time,

05:10.867 --> 05:13.152
- And Genesis lives!
- Here we go. All right.

05:13.227 --> 05:16.152
- Oh, oh, no.
- Oh, no!

05:16.227 --> 05:17.632
No!

05:17.641 --> 05:19.032
Down!

05:19.107 --> 05:21.992
In the beginning...
God created water.

05:22.067 --> 05:23.552
And threw her in it.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.192
Genesis went down hard.

05:25.267 --> 05:27.712
- Just got rocked right in
the pony tail.
- Oh, yeah.

05:27.787 --> 05:29.872
You know, you get the water in
your ear after you go swimming

05:29.881 --> 05:31.152
and you're just trying
to shake it?

05:31.227 --> 05:32.512
- Trying to do that.
- Yeah.

05:32.521 --> 05:34.792
She's going to be
doing that for months.

05:34.867 --> 05:36.872
All right, Paige is back,
it's life two,

05:36.881 --> 05:38.792
and this chasing waterfall
is no joke.

05:38.801 --> 05:41.272
- Speed is king here.
- Speed is king.

05:41.281 --> 05:42.839
Really, the water cannons
are really the kings.

05:42.914 --> 05:44.219
Absolutely.

05:44.294 --> 05:46.352
And they're a wicked
monarch here.

05:46.361 --> 05:47.839
Oh, no!

05:49.987 --> 05:51.712
-[laughing]
-Tremendous dismount.

05:51.787 --> 05:54.919
It is. I guess you give her
credit for that as a gymnast.

05:54.994 --> 05:56.519
Water was like

05:56.594 --> 05:59.712
â™ª Let me embarrass
you on television â™ª

05:59.787 --> 06:03.432
All right, Genesis, second life.
You have a new beginning here.

06:03.507 --> 06:06.232
Hold on... oh!

06:06.307 --> 06:08.919
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

06:08.994 --> 06:14.272
Oh, the Kardashian's
making a splashian.

06:14.347 --> 06:17.312
- Ready, Frogger 1?
- I'm ready, Damon!

06:17.387 --> 06:18.725
Here we go!

06:18.727 --> 06:21.239
She says she can hold a
handstand for 90 seconds.

06:21.314 --> 06:24.879
Can she withstand Ribbit River
for 12 seconds?

06:24.954 --> 06:26.879
That might be all
we need, Wayans.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.152
Here we go.

06:28.227 --> 06:29.512
All right, go. Now, go.
Now, go. Now, go.

06:29.587 --> 06:32.272
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Moving quickly

06:32.281 --> 06:33.632
This is good, moving quick.
Moving quick.

06:33.707 --> 06:35.432
- Ah, ah, ah, no, no, no!
- Go to the rope.

06:35.441 --> 06:36.745
Don't go back!

06:36.821 --> 06:39.712
She's facing... oh, no,
she's all out of whack.

06:39.787 --> 06:41.399
It's all elementary
to us.

06:41.474 --> 06:43.912
What's the chemical symbol
for turn the hell around?

06:43.987 --> 06:45.192
I don't know.

06:45.267 --> 06:46.512
Now she's just going
for a joyride.

06:46.587 --> 06:48.112
- All right.
- There we go, there we go.

06:48.187 --> 06:49.512
- Yes!
- Got the rope!

06:49.587 --> 06:50.832
She reached up for the rope.

06:50.907 --> 06:52.272
Can she pull herself up?

06:52.347 --> 06:53.792
I think she can.

06:53.867 --> 06:55.332
She does.

06:55.407 --> 06:58.112
And now can we get to
the third stepping stone?

06:58.187 --> 07:00.392
Oh, it's beautiful!

07:00.467 --> 07:01.632
Okay, splits.

07:01.707 --> 07:02.719
Put it on a postcard!

07:04.281 --> 07:05.832
Oh, come on!

07:05.907 --> 07:07.032
Oh!

07:07.107 --> 07:08.119
Oh, you got one!

07:16.947 --> 07:19.712
Whoa!

07:19.721 --> 07:21.152
- Oh...
- Come on!

07:21.161 --> 07:23.272
Oh, yeah, here we go.

07:23.347 --> 07:24.792
Come on, Paige, you got it!

07:24.867 --> 07:25.952
Whoa!

07:26.027 --> 07:27.392
This is tough.

07:27.467 --> 07:29.792
She's got to get
the weight off that right foot.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.719
onto the left,
and she's there!

07:31.794 --> 07:33.072
Good job, woo!

07:33.147 --> 07:34.952
Paige turns the page.

07:35.027 --> 07:37.072
Whoa! I did that!
I did that! I did that!

07:37.147 --> 07:39.152
- Whoa, what is that?
- And we're dancing.

07:39.227 --> 07:40.919
You ever do the lasso dance
on the dance floor?

07:40.994 --> 07:41.999
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- One of those?

07:42.074 --> 07:43.392
Whoa, knock the mike over.

07:43.467 --> 07:44.712
[calls]

07:44.787 --> 07:46.152
Great mating call.

07:46.227 --> 07:48.072
10 out of 10, the turtles
won't move unless

07:48.147 --> 07:49.632
they're appropriately
serenaded.

07:49.707 --> 07:51.712
At this point now,
she's taken the lead.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.952
She can only add to it.

07:53.027 --> 07:55.552
Little rock, meet Paige.

07:55.627 --> 07:56.952
What element is the rock
made of?

07:57.027 --> 07:58.685
Is granite an element?

07:58.761 --> 08:02.279
Is foam rubber... I don't know,
but she in on Little Rock.

08:02.354 --> 08:04.552
And here she goes,
can she stick it?

08:04.627 --> 08:06.472
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, nice.

08:06.547 --> 08:08.952
Now every Frogger who
has made it this far

08:09.027 --> 08:10.672
has taken the spinning lily.

08:10.681 --> 08:12.512
Which way is Paige
going to go?

08:12.587 --> 08:14.672
Does she go for the...
oh, she's going for the rope!

08:14.747 --> 08:15.912
Wayans is shook.

08:15.987 --> 08:17.232
Here we go.

08:17.307 --> 08:20.752
Hang on to the rope... oh!
And she's down!

08:20.761 --> 08:23.312
Paige, it's been real,
that's three lives spent.

08:23.387 --> 08:25.312
But she is well
in the lead

08:25.387 --> 08:26.992
after jumping off
Tony Turtle.

08:27.001 --> 08:30.792
- That rope is not your friend.
- Mm-mm.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.572
Please, can we watch the dance?

08:32.574 --> 08:35.959
All right, arms are like, "Hey!
We're going to go this way,

08:36.034 --> 08:37.672
you can go that way."

08:37.747 --> 08:41.792
Fun fact, I used to be able
to do the centipede.

08:41.867 --> 08:43.032
- Not anymore?
- No.

08:43.107 --> 08:45.992
It is the third life
for Genesis.

08:46.067 --> 08:49.112
She has to get further
than Paige to make it to

08:49.187 --> 08:51.632
the Boss Toad bonus round.
Can she do it?

08:51.707 --> 08:53.072
Ready, Frogger 2?

08:53.147 --> 08:55.599
No, you're not gonna do it!

08:55.674 --> 08:57.152
Here we go.

08:57.227 --> 08:59.139
We are going biblical here,

08:59.214 --> 09:03.552
with young Genesis Codina,
23 years old from Los Angeles.

09:03.627 --> 09:06.392
She just watched Paige go
down on Jason Waterfalls.

09:06.467 --> 09:11.352
Already more focused than on
either of the prior two lives.

09:11.427 --> 09:12.552
It's game time.

09:12.627 --> 09:14.032
Third life, go hard, go home.

09:14.107 --> 09:15.712
- Grab the rope.
- Got it.

09:15.721 --> 09:16.872
What's she gonna do with this?

09:16.947 --> 09:18.552
- All right, Genesis.
- Wow.

09:18.627 --> 09:19.912
Come on, now.

09:19.987 --> 09:22.072
One little leap and
she gets to dry land.

09:22.147 --> 09:24.392
This is a tough one, though.
This is a six foot leap,

09:24.467 --> 09:26.432
the water at
500 gallons per minute.

09:26.441 --> 09:27.759
It comes out fast.

09:28.947 --> 09:30.272
Woo!

09:30.347 --> 09:31.332
Oh my gosh!

09:32.987 --> 09:35.112
- No! No!
- Yes, I did it!

09:35.187 --> 09:37.719
- Genesis lives! I like it!
- Oh, great job! Great job!

09:37.794 --> 09:39.239
Yes!

09:39.314 --> 09:40.832
She's all business, but
hold on, we need a mating call.

09:40.907 --> 09:43.152
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

09:43.227 --> 09:45.352
That's her mating call?

09:45.361 --> 09:47.152
- They like it.
- It's a positive.

09:47.227 --> 09:48.552
Might as well
be a Kenny G at this point.

09:48.627 --> 09:51.192
Tony and Tommy are
into it, 5'3",

09:51.267 --> 09:54.192
she's diminutive and
here comes the jump.

09:54.267 --> 09:55.552
- No!
- Oh, that jump!

09:55.627 --> 09:57.312
Did it, did it!

09:57.387 --> 09:59.432
Woo! We got a tie!

09:59.507 --> 10:00.279
No!

10:00.354 --> 10:01.685
Paige is nervous.

10:01.687 --> 10:04.079
It all come down to the next
jump for Genesis.

10:04.154 --> 10:06.352
Oh, man, this is nerve-wracking.

10:06.427 --> 10:08.592
If she makes it,
she's won,

10:08.601 --> 10:10.879
and Paige's dreams are done.

10:13.187 --> 10:15.152
- Yes, I did!
- Oh, Genesis advances!

10:15.227 --> 10:17.159
- All right.
- What a jump!

10:17.234 --> 10:18.792
I'm proud of Genesis.

10:18.867 --> 10:20.552
I love it.

10:20.627 --> 10:22.752
Now let's see if she can
finish the entire course.

10:22.827 --> 10:24.592
Oh!

10:24.601 --> 10:27.192
All right, she's done,
but she wins!

10:27.267 --> 10:28.512
Oh!

10:28.587 --> 10:30.552
We have seen the Patriots
come back

10:30.627 --> 10:31.952
from 28 to 3 in the Super bowl,

10:32.027 --> 10:34.072
that was our closest version
here on Frogger.

10:34.081 --> 10:36.192
Paige, it's been real.

10:36.267 --> 10:38.472
We love you, we say goodbye.

10:38.547 --> 10:40.992
If you're going to lose,
that's how you lose.

10:41.001 --> 10:42.999
If this was a dance show,
believe us,

10:43.074 --> 10:45.352
you'd be hip-hopping
to the grand finals.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.352
[Kyle laughs]

10:47.427 --> 10:48.592
You better win
this whole thing.

10:48.667 --> 10:50.165
You know it.

10:50.167 --> 10:52.512
Congratulations to Genesis,
an incredible comeback.

10:52.587 --> 10:56.119
And she is now through
to the Boss Toad bonus round.

10:56.194 --> 10:58.032
Who else is going to be joining
her in tonight's show down?

10:58.107 --> 10:59.472
We're about to find out.

10:59.481 --> 11:03.832
Next up... Rae Knopick
versus Melissa Reifstack.

11:03.907 --> 11:05.392
Here we go, Wayans.

11:05.467 --> 11:09.072
My name is Rae, I'm 26-years-old
from Tampa, Florida.

11:09.147 --> 11:11.999
And I absolutely love
samba dancing.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.719
It's such a body positive
dancing style.

11:17.794 --> 11:19.199
I just think it's the best.

11:19.274 --> 11:22.479
I'm going to win Frogger
to show women and girls

11:22.554 --> 11:24.272
that they can do this, too.

11:24.347 --> 11:26.879
You better watch out.
I'm going to dance all over you.

11:28.827 --> 11:31.152
I'm Melissa, I
am 34-years-old,

11:31.227 --> 11:33.752
I am from Canandaigua, New York,
and I am a gymnastics coach.

11:33.761 --> 11:36.512
Being a gymnastics' coach is
the best job in the world.

11:36.587 --> 11:38.432
I started gymnastics
at nine and a half.

11:38.507 --> 11:41.039
Still coaching about
15 years later.

11:41.114 --> 11:43.912
I have a pretty
competitive streak in me.

11:43.921 --> 11:46.472
Look out, Boss Toad,
there's a new boss.

11:46.481 --> 11:50.432
Up now... Frogs in Space.

11:50.507 --> 11:52.032
Bouncing to the craters,

11:52.107 --> 11:53.512
Froggers will climb
the satellite

11:53.587 --> 11:55.065
to start the launch sequence.

11:55.067 --> 11:56.752
They'll have to leap
from the second satellite

11:56.761 --> 11:58.912
to the spinning space
amphibian,

11:58.921 --> 12:00.352
dodge the space jets,

12:00.427 --> 12:03.272
and inch around the
galaxy hopper before facing

12:03.347 --> 12:07.992
the space worms on their way
to the landing pad.

12:08.067 --> 12:11.392
So, I have to call
that trampoline a what?

12:11.467 --> 12:14.159
It is a space rocket booster.
State of the art.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.952
It was engineered by brilliant
MIT scientists

12:17.027 --> 12:18.239
and you called it a
trampoline.

12:18.314 --> 12:20.519
So why is it... why
is it not a trampoline?

12:20.594 --> 12:21.952
I want you to tell me
what it is right now.

12:22.027 --> 12:23.232
I've told you 20 times.
What is it?

12:23.307 --> 12:24.592
- Space rocket...
- Don't look at...

12:24.667 --> 12:25.652
You looked at your notes, dude!

12:25.654 --> 12:28.672
Space rocket booster.

12:28.747 --> 12:32.439
I mean, if you're not going
to respect the game, Wayans...

12:32.514 --> 12:33.552
- Rae?
- Yes.

12:33.627 --> 12:35.425
Do you have any tactics?

12:35.427 --> 12:38.112
I'm just going to dance all over
this course and have fun.

12:38.187 --> 12:39.719
Ooh, I like that!

12:39.794 --> 12:42.239
Ready, Frogger 1?
Here we go.

12:43.547 --> 12:44.559
I didn't like that.

12:47.747 --> 12:49.552
- All right. Woo!
- You got it.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.112
And she is off, Rae Knopick,

12:51.187 --> 12:53.352
already on to the crustacean
crater, makes quick work of it.

12:53.427 --> 12:55.519
Staying low,
staying aggressive.

12:55.594 --> 12:58.112
And we are on to the second
Space Rocket Booster.

12:58.187 --> 12:59.832
She is off to
a blistering start.

12:59.907 --> 13:01.152
You love to see it.

13:01.161 --> 13:02.679
She can get to the top
of this thing,

13:02.754 --> 13:05.152
she will start the light and
set off the launch sequence.

13:05.161 --> 13:07.392
You got to scale this
thing one way or another.

13:07.467 --> 13:08.432
There you go, Rae!

13:08.507 --> 13:12.192
And set off that
light at the top.

13:12.267 --> 13:14.072
<i>Launch sequence activated.</i>

13:14.081 --> 13:15.352
She's from Tampa Florida,

13:15.427 --> 13:17.552
home of the world
champion Buccaneers.

13:17.561 --> 13:19.112
Oh, it's so much fun, honestly.

13:19.187 --> 13:22.072
Tom Brady, Rob Grankowski,
and Rae Knopick.

13:22.147 --> 13:23.992
Looking to become the
next champion,

13:24.067 --> 13:25.232
she's go her work
cut out for her.

13:25.307 --> 13:27.392
Ah! Yes!

13:27.467 --> 13:31.552
<i>- T-minus five...</i>
- This is awesome!

13:31.627 --> 13:33.719
Yeah, they took a video game
from the '80s

13:33.794 --> 13:35.952
and made it into a massive
show you're running through.

13:36.027 --> 13:37.352
It's pretty awesome.

13:37.427 --> 13:38.672
You got it, Rae.

13:38.747 --> 13:41.832
Now to the top of
Satellite O,

13:41.907 --> 13:43.312
You know what's
about to happen.

13:43.321 --> 13:45.952
Yeah, unleash hell.
As always.

13:46.027 --> 13:49.599
Those unrelenting space
water jets, Wayans.

13:49.674 --> 13:52.599
Look at that Martian just
rolling up for courtside seats.

13:52.674 --> 13:53.872
He's gotta see it.

13:53.947 --> 13:56.432
Whoa.

13:56.441 --> 13:59.512
Oh, that was a little reckless.
Be she lives on.

13:59.587 --> 14:01.072
- All right.
- Perfect 10 on the landing.

14:01.147 --> 14:03.152
Rae is piecing together
a beautiful crossing

14:03.227 --> 14:04.952
in the face of
the space water jets.

14:05.027 --> 14:06.832
Can she get to
the second space amphibian?

14:06.841 --> 14:08.759
- Rae!
- She's alive and well!

14:08.834 --> 14:10.152
We're playing Frogger!

14:10.227 --> 14:12.952
Oh, my, I felt like that
was aimed right at me!

14:12.961 --> 14:14.272
That's because it was.

14:14.347 --> 14:16.832
We have skilled marksmen,
a team of them.

14:16.907 --> 14:18.912
And those ladies and gentlemen
deserve a raise.

14:18.987 --> 14:20.285
Or an arrest.

14:20.287 --> 14:22.152
They're doing
a stellar job today.

14:22.227 --> 14:24.959
Best in the business, spare
no expense here on Frogger.

14:25.034 --> 14:26.952
<i>T-minus four.</i>

14:27.027 --> 14:28.392
She's lit up two
of the countdown platforms,

14:28.467 --> 14:30.632
and now welcome to
the beautiful ledge.

14:30.707 --> 14:32.112
Upside Croaknick.

14:32.187 --> 14:34.392
Space station now activated.

14:34.467 --> 14:35.952
You are doing awesome.

14:36.027 --> 14:38.632
And this is fun!
It is fun.

14:38.707 --> 14:39.992
This is the time
to have fun.

14:40.067 --> 14:41.712
- Yeah.
- Have your fun now.

14:41.721 --> 14:43.919
Have all of your fun
right down here.

14:46.201 --> 14:46.919
Oh!

14:46.994 --> 14:48.512
That's gonna bruise.

14:48.587 --> 14:50.472
For a first life, Rae's
making a lot of headway here.

14:50.547 --> 14:52.912
But she's going to need
more focus now.

14:52.921 --> 14:55.352
Because those doors'll get ya.

14:55.427 --> 14:58.152
Sort of like marching...

14:58.227 --> 14:59.999
They will march you
right into the water.

15:02.114 --> 15:04.432
You gotta go with
the rhythm of the door.

15:04.507 --> 15:05.952
teach me the ways of
the rhythm, Wayans.

15:06.027 --> 15:10.712
So it's like, one... two...
three... go!

15:10.787 --> 15:12.599
- And oh, oh!
- Oh, ho, ho!

15:12.674 --> 15:13.792
Sorry.

15:13.867 --> 15:17.352
This is the rhythm
of the doors.

15:17.427 --> 15:18.559
It's so scary.

15:18.634 --> 15:20.232
Scary obstacle here, Wayans.

15:20.307 --> 15:23.719
Belches smoke and
flashes gold.

15:23.794 --> 15:26.312
And it will knock you
into the depths.

15:26.321 --> 15:27.352
It's hard!

15:27.427 --> 15:28.852
They're scary!

15:28.927 --> 15:31.112
She's got one more
important door to negotiate.

15:31.187 --> 15:32.552
And then it's home stretch
time, Wayans.

15:32.627 --> 15:35.079
She's studied it,
she's thought about it,

15:35.154 --> 15:36.759
it's go time.

15:38.427 --> 15:39.839
Oh!

15:51.914 --> 15:53.679
We are on the edge of our seats.

15:53.754 --> 15:55.359
Rae is still on
her first life.

15:55.434 --> 15:58.119
She just has to make it
past this door,

15:58.194 --> 16:01.552
and she's headed
to the homestretch.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.472
Oh!

16:03.481 --> 16:05.152
Clean shot!

16:05.227 --> 16:08.992
Down goes Frogger!

16:09.001 --> 16:11.592
That was what we call
a de-cleater.

16:11.667 --> 16:12.599
Aw, man.

16:12.674 --> 16:14.152
Caught it square
on the shoulder.

16:14.227 --> 16:16.032
It's going to spin her around
a full 90 degrees

16:16.107 --> 16:17.592
for the eight foot plunge.

16:17.667 --> 16:20.472
Just a straight shot,
completely legal,

16:20.547 --> 16:23.159
clean hit by the door,
no flag, play on.

16:23.234 --> 16:25.312
It ain't over, Wayans.

16:25.321 --> 16:26.519
- It's not over.
- It ain't over.

16:26.594 --> 16:27.879
Far from over.

16:27.954 --> 16:31.312
Melissa Reifstack, welcome
to frogs in space.

16:31.387 --> 16:32.592
Ready, Frogger 2?

16:32.667 --> 16:34.192
Here we go!

16:34.267 --> 16:38.759
Coach Melissa Reifstack, the
pride of Canandaigua, New York!

16:38.834 --> 16:39.912
Here we go, Wayans.

16:39.987 --> 16:41.072
Hoo-hoo!

16:41.147 --> 16:42.232
That was awesome!

16:42.307 --> 16:44.592
- I already love it.
- Yes! Go, girl!

16:44.667 --> 16:45.592
You got this!

16:45.667 --> 16:46.872
We got ourselves an Avenger!

16:46.947 --> 16:49.232
She is across the second
Space Rocket booster

16:49.241 --> 16:51.952
in record time
to Satellite X.

16:51.961 --> 16:55.232
This little gymnast
is "gymnysting" right now.

16:55.307 --> 16:58.192
- She's what?
- She's "gymnasting" right now.

16:58.201 --> 17:00.312
Nice one. Climb that.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.112
Start the launch sequence,
my friends.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.272
Light it up, baby.

17:04.347 --> 17:07.272
<i>Launch sequence, activated.</i>

17:07.347 --> 17:08.992
- Ah.....
- Oh, yes.

17:09.067 --> 17:11.792
It's like when they open the
briefcase in pulp fiction.

17:11.867 --> 17:13.619
Ooh, yes, what is
in that thing?

17:13.621 --> 17:16.592
- Somebody's soul?
- Marcellus Wallace's soul,
I heard.

17:16.601 --> 17:18.759
It got out of the Band-Aid
on the back of his neck.

17:18.834 --> 17:20.432
They say all kinds of theories.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.472
She has to now get to that
number five,

17:22.547 --> 17:23.592
the countdown platform.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.072
- I like this speed.
- I love the speed.

17:25.147 --> 17:26.472
She's already here.

17:26.547 --> 17:29.032
Can she get to the number five?
Oh, boy, yes.

17:29.107 --> 17:30.579
- No problem.
-<i> T-minus five.</i>

17:30.654 --> 17:33.112
You know, I've got a soft
spot for gymnastics.

17:33.187 --> 17:34.992
My mom was a gymnast.

17:35.067 --> 17:36.192
That's cool, I didn't
know that.

17:36.267 --> 17:37.432
Your mom was a gymnast
in her day?

17:37.507 --> 17:38.952
Taught me how to do
a back handspring

17:39.027 --> 17:40.512
while she was pregnant
with my little brother.

17:40.587 --> 17:41.952
-Wow!
- Probably not the healthiest
thing to do.

17:42.027 --> 17:43.032
[Kyle laughs]

17:43.107 --> 17:44.472
Let's see those gym skills now.

17:44.547 --> 17:46.832
Let's do it, here we go,
we're on the vault.

17:46.907 --> 17:48.552
The wrist bands match the pants.

17:48.627 --> 17:50.872
She looks great, she's got
the double buns on top.

17:50.947 --> 17:53.752
A little bit Princess Leia
adjacent with that hairstyle.

17:53.827 --> 17:55.072
I like it, it's strategic.

17:55.081 --> 17:56.999
You're a gymnast,
you can do this.

17:59.427 --> 18:02.152
- And oh, there!
- That was fantastic!

18:02.227 --> 18:04.872
Melissa!

18:04.947 --> 18:05.872
Yes!

18:05.947 --> 18:07.272
She's getting blasted.

18:07.281 --> 18:09.272
Almost blasted the buns
right off her head.

18:09.281 --> 18:10.852
That is hectic.

18:10.928 --> 18:13.152
Her students, young
athletes watching at home...

18:13.227 --> 18:14.912
- rooting for Coach Reifstack.
-<i> T-minus four.</i>

18:14.987 --> 18:15.912
And they got to be thrilled.

18:15.987 --> 18:17.992
Space Station activated.

18:18.001 --> 18:19.392
I think it's interesting as
a coach here.

18:19.467 --> 18:21.072
She's had a long time
while Rae was going

18:21.147 --> 18:22.992
to think about this
and to strategize.

18:23.067 --> 18:25.872
- This is where she lives.
- I've got this.

18:25.947 --> 18:27.632
Pure gold melted down
to make those doors.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.679
I remember when M.C. Hammer
did the commercials for that.

18:29.754 --> 18:30.832
Yes!

18:30.907 --> 18:32.392
Please! Melissa, don't hurt 'em.

18:32.467 --> 18:33.992
[laughing]

18:34.001 --> 18:36.032
- Oh!
- Oh!

18:36.107 --> 18:37.152
She did it!

18:37.227 --> 18:38.632
- Wow.
- Yes.

18:38.707 --> 18:40.472
- An ad-lib save!
- Yes!

18:40.481 --> 18:42.192
What happened?

18:42.194 --> 18:46.712
She got knocked off her rocker,
and turned it into a dance move.

18:46.787 --> 18:49.792
Only a gymnast could turn that
into an actually landing.

18:49.801 --> 18:53.592
I agree. I think she's invented
her own discipline, frognastics.

18:53.667 --> 18:56.712
This is the home stretch
of Frogs in Space.

18:56.787 --> 19:00.479
Landing pads, space worms,
and three countdown platforms.

19:00.554 --> 19:02.799
She is nearly within
striking distance.

19:02.874 --> 19:04.312
- Oops!
- Onto the lily.

19:04.387 --> 19:05.992
Okay, no problem.
This is the bigger.

19:06.067 --> 19:07.352
Now they get smaller.

19:07.427 --> 19:08.752
What a day to be
sitting up here,

19:08.827 --> 19:11.712
watching these young ladies
crush this course.

19:11.787 --> 19:14.032
Hey, no place
I'd rather be.

19:14.107 --> 19:16.192
Except maybe home.

19:16.267 --> 19:17.552
This is our home now, Wayans.

19:17.627 --> 19:19.392
This is our home,
this is our home.

19:19.401 --> 19:21.512
She is on fire.

19:21.587 --> 19:23.672
One down. Two down.
Aggressive.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.512
What? Oh my gosh!

19:25.587 --> 19:28.312
You're there, you're there,
you're there, you're there!

19:28.387 --> 19:30.072
Oh, it's like she was
playing hopscotch.

19:30.147 --> 19:31.552
She's not going to stop,
Wayans,

19:31.627 --> 19:32.952
she's might finish
this whole thing right now.

19:33.027 --> 19:34.272
Oh my goodness.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.512
Melissa Reifstack
is two jumps away

19:36.587 --> 19:38.872
from a prolific first crossing.

19:38.947 --> 19:40.472
Can she make the final jump?

19:40.481 --> 19:42.712
Big jump, big jump, come on.
Big jump.

19:42.787 --> 19:43.992
Last one.

19:44.067 --> 19:46.952
This is the ultimate
gymnastic floor routine

19:47.027 --> 19:48.359
on Frogs in Space.

19:48.434 --> 19:51.752
The widest jump so far.
I know it's not that far!

19:51.827 --> 19:53.312
What if she flips backwards,
Wayans,

19:53.387 --> 19:54.592
and sticks it on
the launch button?

19:54.667 --> 19:57.352
Honestly, I will literally
poop my pants.

19:57.427 --> 19:59.159
In celebration.

19:59.234 --> 20:01.272
- Celebratory poop?
- Celebratory poop.

20:01.347 --> 20:03.752
Can she conquer the red
launch button

20:03.827 --> 20:05.519
that has humbled so many
brave Froggers?

20:06.987 --> 20:08.632
Can she finish?

20:08.707 --> 20:10.992
Can she land the dismount?

20:11.067 --> 20:13.879
It's a full eight feet.

20:16.754 --> 20:17.672
Yes!

20:17.747 --> 20:19.392
Yeah!

20:19.467 --> 20:21.032
Yes!

20:21.107 --> 20:24.992
Coach Reifstack, welcome
to the confetti!

20:25.067 --> 20:27.592
Rockets away!

20:27.667 --> 20:28.752
Yes!

20:28.827 --> 20:30.272
Awesome.

20:30.347 --> 20:32.792
Melissa Reifstack,
you are moving on.

20:32.801 --> 20:34.919
Frogger Champion.

20:34.994 --> 20:36.472
We're so excited for her.

20:36.547 --> 20:38.912
Who else will be joining
the coach in tonight's showdown?

20:38.987 --> 20:40.999
Let's find out, everybody.

20:52.107 --> 20:54.632
Buckle up tight, because
we're taking a drive

20:54.641 --> 20:56.632
through Frog City.

20:56.707 --> 20:59.079
Froggers try to hit
the crosswalk button

20:59.154 --> 21:02.232
so they can cross the bridge
and get past the truck.

21:02.241 --> 21:03.799
They'll order a pizza

21:03.874 --> 21:06.399
which they'll collect
by dodging the spinning cars

21:06.474 --> 21:08.519
and slipping past
the ramming vans

21:08.594 --> 21:12.712
to the landing pad.
pizza in hand.

21:12.787 --> 21:14.272
It's the late night dinner dash

21:14.347 --> 21:17.232
that will leave our Froggers
out of breath.

21:17.241 --> 21:20.712
But let's just hope
they don't run out of lives.

21:20.787 --> 21:22.112
The Croaklyn bridge.

21:22.121 --> 21:24.832
At 12 foot see-saw
with no grip

21:24.907 --> 21:26.152
and plenty of slip.

21:26.161 --> 21:27.952
Froggers must
time their jump

21:28.027 --> 21:30.072
or slide right off.

21:30.147 --> 21:32.832
The fast and the froggiest.

21:32.907 --> 21:34.672
With less than a second
to make each jump,

21:34.747 --> 21:37.112
it's about speed and accuracy.

21:37.121 --> 21:40.312
And tonight's last crossing
before Boss Toad

21:40.321 --> 21:44.672
gaming goddess Grace versus
Kaytie from Katy.

21:44.747 --> 21:47.552
Hi, I'm Grace Chan, I'm 45.

21:47.627 --> 21:51.072
I am that '80s girl,
full time.

21:51.147 --> 21:53.512
Growing up in the '80s,
oh, God, I was such a dork.

21:53.587 --> 21:55.479
My parents owned an
arcade, so,

21:55.554 --> 21:57.552
every day after school
I'd get to go

21:57.627 --> 22:00.432
and I slay every day,
still, in an arcade.

22:00.507 --> 22:01.745
[laughing]

22:01.821 --> 22:03.952
Frogger taught me how to
jaywalk across the street

22:03.961 --> 22:05.592
without getting
hit by cars.

22:05.667 --> 22:07.712
So you better watch out.

22:07.787 --> 22:10.272
I'm Kaytie from Katy, Texas.

22:10.347 --> 22:11.632
And I'm 28-years-old.

22:11.641 --> 22:12.945
I'm a single mother.

22:13.021 --> 22:14.552
I am a little bit of
an adrenalin junkie.

22:14.627 --> 22:17.752
I love anything that
puts a little fear under me.

22:17.761 --> 22:20.072
Being a single mom,
it's definitely challenging.

22:20.147 --> 22:22.479
But I love raising someone
that looks just like me

22:22.554 --> 22:23.739
and acts just like me.

22:23.814 --> 22:25.952
This competition is
really important to me

22:26.027 --> 22:28.192
just to show my daughter
you can do anything

22:28.267 --> 22:30.599
you put your mind to.

22:30.674 --> 22:33.272
First up, Grace Chan.

22:33.347 --> 22:36.072
Grace... ready, Frogger 1?

22:36.147 --> 22:38.272
The power of the '80s
compels me, let's do it.

22:38.281 --> 22:39.719
All right.

22:39.794 --> 22:41.032
Love your leggings, by the way,
they're awesome.

22:41.107 --> 22:43.192
You want to borrow them
after I'm done?

22:43.267 --> 22:45.112
Uh... maybe if they're dry.

22:45.187 --> 22:47.192
All right, Grace do this
for '84.

22:47.267 --> 22:48.672
Do this for '88.

22:48.747 --> 22:51.239
She knows the rules,
put a quarter in, three lives.

22:51.314 --> 22:53.472
Okay, Hopper's Highway.

22:53.547 --> 22:56.712
Welcome to Amazing Grace,
she is a wee little woman,

22:56.787 --> 23:00.472
only 5'1"...
she is down!

23:00.481 --> 23:02.152
Oh...

23:02.227 --> 23:03.432
These jumps are
going to be tough.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.272
I hope she said wee
when she slipped.

23:05.347 --> 23:06.792
- I think she might have.
- That would've been cute.

23:06.867 --> 23:07.999
At this point it's over.

23:08.074 --> 23:09.992
- Wee!
- There's your pitfall.

23:10.067 --> 23:11.312
I'd look great
in those leggings.

23:11.321 --> 23:12.432
You would, yeah.
You would.

23:12.507 --> 23:13.432
Oh...

23:13.507 --> 23:14.632
Ready, Frogger 2?

23:14.641 --> 23:16.719
Here we go.

23:16.794 --> 23:20.399
- Kaytie from Katy, Texas.
- It's so awesome.

23:20.474 --> 23:21.479
I love that.

23:23.667 --> 23:26.352
Wait, did they already count?
I like blacked out.

23:26.361 --> 23:27.632
Go, go, go!

23:27.707 --> 23:28.865
- Go!
- Oh my God.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.792
- You got this, girl.
- Here we go!

23:30.867 --> 23:33.552
- On to Frog City.
- Excited.

23:33.627 --> 23:34.832
You got it.

23:34.907 --> 23:36.272
Oh wait, I have to go, right?

23:36.347 --> 23:38.552
Does she have wings?
Yes, she does!

23:38.627 --> 23:40.032
- Great, great jump.
- When you're small like that,

23:40.107 --> 23:41.199
you got to run and jump.

23:41.274 --> 23:42.432
Especially if you're
teeny-tiny.

23:42.507 --> 23:44.192
I got past where
I thought I would.

23:44.267 --> 23:46.832
She need to make it to the all
important cross-walk button.

23:46.841 --> 23:47.872
Here we go!

23:47.947 --> 23:49.872
Got it, now get off!

23:49.947 --> 23:51.712
Don't go out of bounds!

23:51.787 --> 23:53.352
- No problem.
- I like it.

23:53.427 --> 23:54.512
- Kaytie can jump.
- I like what she's doing.

23:54.521 --> 23:56.152
Ride it on over.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.832
All right, you've got to
go another jump across,

23:58.841 --> 24:00.232
every one of these
seven feet.

24:00.307 --> 24:02.512
Give her 21 feet in a row!
Kaytie came to play!

24:02.521 --> 24:05.432
Wow. Wow, Kaytie!

24:05.507 --> 24:07.792
Croaklyn bridge, welcome...
Oh!

24:07.801 --> 24:09.032
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Oh-no!

24:09.107 --> 24:10.032
- Stop... whoa.
- Wow.

24:10.107 --> 24:12.472
- Whoa.
- [screams]

24:12.481 --> 24:14.639
She's going to give us
a cardiac case here, Kaytie.

24:14.714 --> 24:15.992
Golly, man.

24:16.067 --> 24:17.312
Cardiac Kaytie.

24:17.387 --> 24:18.425
Oh...

24:18.501 --> 24:21.232
I'm out of breath.
This is scary.

24:21.241 --> 24:23.312
All right... a wing
and a prayer

24:23.387 --> 24:26.192
as she approaches the mouth
of Thunder truck.

24:26.267 --> 24:28.712
She under the truck!
This is totally fair.

24:28.787 --> 24:30.359
I love it!
Beautiful!

24:30.434 --> 24:31.592
Oh my gosh.

24:31.601 --> 24:32.792
Oh, she went south.

24:32.867 --> 24:34.432
Oh my God.
I've never seen...

24:34.507 --> 24:37.399
- It's a beautiful strategy.
- ...any crosser do this.

24:37.474 --> 24:39.672
No. It's like Indiana Jones
going beneath the truck,

24:39.747 --> 24:41.592
you just don't see it much
and we don't recommend it.

24:41.667 --> 24:43.472
Don't try this
at home, young Froggers.

24:43.547 --> 24:45.072
I can't believe
I did that.

24:45.147 --> 24:47.032
And Damon, I got this
tingle in my pinky,

24:47.107 --> 24:48.072
the phone might be ringing.

24:48.147 --> 24:49.792
I'm about the get a call.

24:49.801 --> 24:50.512
I'm out of breath.

24:50.587 --> 24:52.552
[phone rings]

24:52.627 --> 24:54.992
Good evening, Pizza Rana,
can I take your order?

24:55.067 --> 24:57.632
Um, a big barbecue chicken
pizza please,

24:57.641 --> 24:59.032
waiting for me at the end.

24:59.107 --> 25:00.392
You want your pepperoni pizza?

25:00.401 --> 25:01.792
No pepperoni.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.599
Yeah, I got one
pepperoni coming up.

25:03.674 --> 25:05.159
Did you even listen to her?

25:05.234 --> 25:07.432
Oh...
Come on.

25:07.507 --> 25:08.519
[laughing]

25:08.594 --> 25:11.472
All right, another
satisfied customer.

25:11.547 --> 25:14.432
Now it's back along
the warehouse again,

25:14.507 --> 25:18.152
and towards the Fast and
the Froggiest drift cars.

25:18.227 --> 25:20.992
From there, it's to the pizza
van to pick up her pie.

25:21.067 --> 25:22.512
This is, like, scary.

25:22.587 --> 25:25.352
She's still on her first life.
How far can she go?

25:25.427 --> 25:26.592
And now the
Fast and the Froggiest.

25:26.667 --> 25:28.072
Whoo!

25:28.147 --> 25:30.032
I love how every single jump
is a big jump for her.

25:30.107 --> 25:31.352
Every one.

25:31.427 --> 25:32.759
Everything she does,
we don't know.

25:32.834 --> 25:34.272
She can do a back flip,
the whole place can explode.

25:34.347 --> 25:35.872
Here we go onto the next one.

25:35.947 --> 25:37.192
Oh my God, Kaytie-- ah!

25:37.267 --> 25:40.192
Kaytie goes in,
and she got spun.

25:40.267 --> 25:41.232
Wow.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.072
Oh, man.

25:43.147 --> 25:44.592
Kaytie, you're awesome.

25:44.667 --> 25:48.279
Can't get past that last
Fast and the Froggiest car.

25:48.354 --> 25:50.352
They caught her right
on the left hip,

25:50.427 --> 25:53.199
and spun her precisely
90 degrees around.

25:53.274 --> 25:56.759
Kaytie from Katy is
bringing it. I like it.

25:56.834 --> 25:59.712
We now go to the
second life for Grace Chan

25:59.787 --> 26:01.432
from Los Angeles, California.

26:01.507 --> 26:03.992
Has a huge margin to make-up
after an incredible run

26:04.067 --> 26:05.752
by Kaytie.

26:05.827 --> 26:07.352
Here she goes.

26:07.427 --> 26:09.872
She needs to make it further
than the Fast and the Froggiest

26:09.947 --> 26:11.432
to take the lead.

26:11.507 --> 26:13.672
Can she get across this first
jump and build some confidence?

26:13.747 --> 26:14.592
And she's got it!

26:14.667 --> 26:15.632
- Got it!
- Great.

26:15.707 --> 26:17.352
- Great job.
- Great job.

26:17.427 --> 26:19.039
Now she's got to make it over
to the crosswalk button, folks,

26:19.114 --> 26:20.672
It's patience
and it's timing.

26:20.681 --> 26:21.912
Got it.

26:21.987 --> 26:23.752
All right, let's do this.

26:23.761 --> 26:25.272
Uh oh.
Get across...

26:25.347 --> 26:27.632
- And she's got it now.
- Did a great job.

26:27.707 --> 26:29.832
We got one more jump.
Can she do it one more time?

26:29.907 --> 26:31.839
Then we're on the bridge,
and then we got something.

26:34.107 --> 26:35.432
She's across, no problem

26:35.507 --> 26:36.359
Grace in your face.

26:36.434 --> 26:38.632
Here we go, Grace in the face.

26:38.707 --> 26:39.759
Okay, that's not fair!

26:39.834 --> 26:43.232
Oh, no! We finally...
She lost!

26:43.307 --> 26:46.072
The bar of soap slides
right into the water.

26:46.147 --> 26:47.232
Damon, we love Grace.

26:47.307 --> 26:49.079
I think you kinda wanted that.

26:49.154 --> 26:51.112
I did. I did,
it was good to see.

26:51.187 --> 26:52.912
Very humorous image.

26:52.921 --> 26:57.079
There she goes.
Gravity remains undefeated.

26:57.154 --> 26:59.359
It literally was a slide to her.

26:59.434 --> 27:02.272
Okay, back to Kaytie from
Katy Texas.

27:02.281 --> 27:04.832
One of the most exciting
pound for pound runs

27:04.841 --> 27:06.152
we've ever seen on life one.

27:06.161 --> 27:08.152
What awaits us one life two?

27:08.227 --> 27:09.479
Don't pee in the water!

27:11.307 --> 27:13.512
Let's see if there's some sort
of strategy that comes in play

27:13.587 --> 27:16.072
with her second attempt against
the Fast and the Froggiest.

27:16.081 --> 27:19.912
- Go, go, go.
- Okay, okay, okay.

27:19.987 --> 27:21.312
- Oh, she got it!
- Did she hold on?

27:21.387 --> 27:22.799
I think she kept in
contact the whole time.

27:22.874 --> 27:24.479
Now the strength comes in play.

27:24.554 --> 27:27.632
She's got it. Brilliant,
brilliant, brilliant stuff

27:27.707 --> 27:29.599
- Great job.
- She held on with one hand.

27:29.674 --> 27:31.552
By mere fingers.
That's all you need.

27:31.627 --> 27:33.065
She's here to win.

27:33.141 --> 27:35.352
But first she's got a hell of
an imposing obstacle here

27:35.427 --> 27:36.752
in the Jean Claude Van Ramm.

27:36.827 --> 27:38.352
Gotta grab that pizza.

27:38.427 --> 27:40.512
Hop a couple of cabs and
eventually home

27:40.587 --> 27:43.392
to the landing pad.

27:43.467 --> 27:44.832
Oh...

27:44.907 --> 27:46.199
Oh!

27:46.274 --> 27:47.732
Oh, no not going to do it
again, is she?

27:47.734 --> 27:49.112
- She's down, she's still on!
- Wow!

27:49.187 --> 27:50.999
Oh, this is going to
take a battle.

27:51.074 --> 27:52.399
You can get up there, come on!

27:52.474 --> 27:53.632
- She's holding on.
- Come on, girl!

27:53.707 --> 27:54.832
You got this!

27:54.907 --> 27:56.192
Push yourself, up, up,
up, up, up!

27:56.267 --> 27:57.792
- Can she get up?
- Come on!

27:57.801 --> 28:00.672
Come on, fight, fight. Fight.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.632
- She's down!
- Oh, no.

28:02.707 --> 28:04.672
- Disappointed?
- Yeah.

28:04.747 --> 28:06.159
That was so close!

28:07.347 --> 28:09.359
Grace Chan is down
to her last life.

28:09.434 --> 28:11.632
She's got to get
as far as Kaytie,

28:11.707 --> 28:14.432
or Grace goes home.

28:14.507 --> 28:15.259
[beeping]

28:15.334 --> 28:16.732
Where's my skateboard?

28:16.734 --> 28:17.792
I've got to make like
Marty McFly

28:17.801 --> 28:19.239
back of this cop car.

28:22.107 --> 28:23.632
Oh, gentle.

28:23.641 --> 28:24.919
Got to get to the feet.
Oh, no!

28:24.994 --> 28:27.432
No, hold on, Grace,
hold on!

28:27.507 --> 28:28.592
No, not again!

28:28.667 --> 28:30.632
And she's dumped again.

28:30.707 --> 28:31.879
Woo!

28:33.507 --> 28:36.152
Kaytie from Katy Texas,

28:36.227 --> 28:41.152
you are moving on to the
Boss Toad Bonus round, baby!

28:41.161 --> 28:43.432
Congratulations to one of
our new favorites,

28:43.441 --> 28:45.992
Kaytie from Katy,
our final Frogger

28:46.067 --> 28:48.352
through to the Boss Toad
bonus round,

28:48.427 --> 28:50.952
and we have a showdown,
my friends.

28:51.027 --> 28:53.159
The Medal of Freedom?
The Nobel Prize?

28:53.234 --> 28:56.032
The Heisman trophy?
The all pale in comparison

28:56.107 --> 28:58.512
to the Golden Fanny Pack.

28:58.587 --> 29:00.032
Only one of these Froggers
can take home

29:00.107 --> 29:01.472
the $10,000 prize tonight.

29:01.547 --> 29:04.199
Take a deep breath,
hold your nose, folks,

29:04.274 --> 29:08.039
because here comes that
stanky man, Boss Toad.

29:18.961 --> 29:22.032
He calls himself
an influencer.

29:22.107 --> 29:25.552
Yet, he has no followers.

29:25.627 --> 29:29.879
He is a pirate
among amphibians.

29:29.954 --> 29:32.999
And he never picks up
the check.

29:33.074 --> 29:36.039
He is... Boss Toad.

29:38.067 --> 29:40.992
Every week, Boss Toad
kidnaps five froglets,

29:41.067 --> 29:44.032
and every week, he gets
away Scott free.

29:44.107 --> 29:46.792
I mean... shouldn't there
be consequences?

29:46.867 --> 29:48.032
Hello.

29:48.107 --> 29:49.992
In the Boss Toad round,
our Froggers each

29:50.067 --> 29:51.799
get five minutes to
rescue those froglets

29:51.874 --> 29:53.192
as many as they can.

29:53.267 --> 29:54.952
Froggers start in
the middle of the crossing

29:55.027 --> 29:56.912
and they can choose
any route they want

29:56.921 --> 29:58.632
to get the job done.

29:58.707 --> 30:00.039
But they only have one life,

30:00.114 --> 30:02.592
so if they fall in,
game over.

30:02.667 --> 30:03.832
You know what we need?

30:03.907 --> 30:05.039
We need a new Law & Order
spin-off.

30:05.114 --> 30:07.352
Dang right, we need
Law & Order: AVU.

30:07.427 --> 30:08.465
Ooh.

30:08.541 --> 30:11.072
- Amphibious Victim's Unit.
- Yeah!

30:11.081 --> 30:13.272
Making up the Amphibious
Victim's Unit,

30:13.347 --> 30:16.632
we have junior
detective Genesis,

30:16.707 --> 30:19.712
who was destroyed by
Jason Waterfalls.

30:19.721 --> 30:21.712
Forensic investigator Kaytie,

30:21.721 --> 30:25.752
who was side-swiped by
the Frogs and the Furious.

30:25.761 --> 30:30.039
But first up, it's supervising
detective Melissa.

30:31.027 --> 30:33.192
- Melissa?
- Hello, Damon.

30:33.267 --> 30:35.512
It's not easy being
first across.

30:35.587 --> 30:36.845
I know.

30:36.921 --> 30:39.312
As a coach, you are used
to setting the standard.

30:39.387 --> 30:40.712
Ready, Frogger?

30:40.721 --> 30:42.479
- Ready!
- Here we go.

30:46.547 --> 30:50.392
Okay, Wayans, let's see
Coach Reifstack's floor routine.

30:50.467 --> 30:51.432
All right!

30:51.507 --> 30:52.545
Wow.

30:52.621 --> 30:53.712
Awkward landing on
Harriet the hippo.

30:53.787 --> 30:55.112
I hope she's all right.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.552
It's a much harder
hippo than I thought.

30:57.627 --> 30:59.272
The gymnast makes
another jump.

30:59.347 --> 31:01.072
All right, Mellissa is tough!

31:01.147 --> 31:03.232
Gymnastic, very tough sport.

31:03.307 --> 31:05.272
There's a lot of punishment,
she's doing it all.

31:05.347 --> 31:06.592
Oh...

31:06.667 --> 31:08.432
I know you got a soft
spot for gymnast's Kyle.

31:08.441 --> 31:09.992
Oh, it's true,
my daughter's a gymnast.

31:10.067 --> 31:11.639
A lot of my friends
are gymnasts,

31:11.714 --> 31:13.752
and one of my best
drinking buddies, shout out,

31:13.827 --> 31:16.552
a guy named Jim Ness. Love Jim.
You know Jim, right?

31:16.561 --> 31:17.872
Big Jim.

31:17.947 --> 31:19.792
She's headed towards
the helipad.

31:19.801 --> 31:22.232
This is the big time here,
every second counts.

31:22.307 --> 31:24.312
Fire up the chopper.

31:24.387 --> 31:26.872
Come here, little froggy.

31:26.947 --> 31:28.532
Just going to lock away
this froglet

31:28.534 --> 31:31.399
and go for a little bit of
a ride on Hopper Chopper 1000.

31:31.474 --> 31:34.672
Here comes her flight, can she
hold on to the froglet?

31:34.681 --> 31:36.552
Woo, this is fun!

31:36.627 --> 31:38.752
Can she land is the problem.

31:38.827 --> 31:40.632
The landing is going
to be rough.

31:40.707 --> 31:42.872
Woo.

31:42.947 --> 31:43.952
Come here, little froggy.

31:44.027 --> 31:46.472
Wow, she is tough.

31:46.481 --> 31:47.999
One froglet in.

31:48.074 --> 31:50.119
Good job, woo!

31:50.194 --> 31:52.832
And she's not done yet.
The gymnastics' coach

31:52.907 --> 31:54.479
is off and racing.

31:54.554 --> 31:55.752
She's going after
that second froglet.

31:55.827 --> 31:57.439
- Smart move.
- Strategic.

31:59.281 --> 32:00.832
This is a huge jump, though.

32:00.907 --> 32:01.952
Will she throw it?
Absolutely!

32:02.027 --> 32:03.599
Stay up there,
stay up there!

32:03.674 --> 32:06.312
Even for a gymnast,
this is a big jump.

32:06.387 --> 32:09.119
If she can make this jump, it's
two froglets on the board.

32:10.321 --> 32:12.839
She's off,
and she's got a fight.

32:12.914 --> 32:14.432
- Come on, come on, come on!
- She's gotta fight.

32:14.441 --> 32:15.792
Fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight.

32:15.801 --> 32:17.152
Go on, go on!

32:17.227 --> 32:18.519
- Yeah!
- Yes.

32:18.594 --> 32:22.432
Coach Melissa Reifstack
with two in the basinets.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.432
That's that coach strength
right there, buddy.

32:24.507 --> 32:25.099
Whoa!

32:25.174 --> 32:26.452
Oh my God.

32:26.527 --> 32:27.799
The Froggers know that
two could win it, Damon,

32:27.874 --> 32:29.032
and she's not done.

32:29.107 --> 32:31.232
Attempting to get her
third froglet.

32:31.307 --> 32:33.872
Melissa, come on.
You keep losing time.

32:33.947 --> 32:35.552
She made that huge leap
in Frogs in Space

32:35.627 --> 32:36.985
to get to the launchpad.

32:37.061 --> 32:39.032
and it looks like she's
backing up to do the same again.

32:39.107 --> 32:40.792
Here we go.

32:40.801 --> 32:42.912
Oh, that's a far jump, she's
going to have to fight again.

32:42.987 --> 32:45.152
- She's tough.
- She's tough as nails.

32:45.161 --> 32:47.712
To her young athletes
watching at home,

32:47.787 --> 32:50.152
rooting for Coach Reifstack
and they gotta be thrilled.

32:50.227 --> 32:54.472
Not one bit of
this crossing is easy.

32:54.547 --> 32:55.632
Maybe that part.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.039
But everything else...

32:59.281 --> 33:01.672
She does have time,
but a lot of work...

33:01.747 --> 33:03.112
She's not slowing down.

33:03.187 --> 33:04.512
How in the world... okay.

33:04.587 --> 33:08.232
But this gator is rough.

33:08.307 --> 33:10.632
A gentle landing
with the hands.

33:10.707 --> 33:12.472
Again, the grace of a gymnast.

33:12.547 --> 33:15.432
Turtle... how in the world do
I jump on to that?

33:15.507 --> 33:18.992
We know the turtles
are always tough.

33:19.067 --> 33:20.472
Uh, that makes it difficult.

33:20.547 --> 33:22.232
But we could be looking at
a third froglet here.

33:22.307 --> 33:24.032
Come on.

33:24.107 --> 33:26.999
She prepares to launch
herself...

33:27.074 --> 33:29.759
to the turtle,
and she is down!

33:29.834 --> 33:31.512
- Oh!
- Oh!

33:31.587 --> 33:33.672
That's the end of it,
but a round of applause

33:33.747 --> 33:36.472
and a huge amount of respect
for Melissa Reifstack.

33:36.547 --> 33:38.092
Great effort.

33:38.167 --> 33:42.752
All right, the next Frogger to
cross tonight, Gen Kardashian.

33:42.827 --> 33:45.152
- Genesis.
- Hello, Damon.

33:45.227 --> 33:47.792
You will need to
rescue three froglets

33:47.801 --> 33:50.432
or two in a faster time.

33:50.507 --> 33:52.792
- Ready, Frogger 2?
- I'm ready.

33:52.867 --> 33:54.319
Here we go.

33:59.107 --> 34:00.499
- Oof!
- And she's off.

34:00.574 --> 34:01.632
Genesis is going to have
to fight to get the leg up.

34:01.707 --> 34:02.999
- All right!
- All right.

34:03.074 --> 34:04.872
- Nice job, Genesis.
- Great job.

34:04.947 --> 34:06.432
Lot of core strength right
there, Genesis.

34:06.507 --> 34:07.832
Oh!

34:07.907 --> 34:09.912
- Off goes Genesis,
a rough jump.
- Jeez Louise.

34:09.987 --> 34:10.752
Yeah, we're good.

34:10.827 --> 34:12.432
Okay, Genesis is tough.

34:12.507 --> 34:13.912
She's proving something here.

34:13.987 --> 34:16.592
The lily pads, they are padded,

34:16.667 --> 34:19.112
but this is not a pillow
she's falling on.

34:19.187 --> 34:21.952
She gets up though
and she's not stopping.

34:22.027 --> 34:23.232
I'm impressed already.

34:23.307 --> 34:25.439
All right, Genesis,
tough cookie right here.

34:28.107 --> 34:30.712
She's copying Melissa.

34:30.787 --> 34:32.392
Choose other options!

34:32.467 --> 34:33.792
She'll have to keep
up the pace

34:33.801 --> 34:35.379
if she wants to beat her.

34:35.454 --> 34:38.319
Can she reach up to the
Hopper Chopper 1000?

34:38.394 --> 34:42.032
- She is 5'3".
- Same height as Kim Kardashian.

34:42.107 --> 34:43.152
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

34:43.227 --> 34:45.592
- You know that?
- She's tiny.

34:45.601 --> 34:47.312
She's your neighbor,
you know that stuff.

34:47.321 --> 34:49.592
All right. Back to the chopper.

34:49.667 --> 34:51.272
You don't want to lose
you grip on

34:51.347 --> 34:52.832
the bottom of that helicopter.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.312
Woo!

34:54.387 --> 34:58.752
And we are flying, Wayans.

34:58.827 --> 35:00.392
Here comes the tough
landing, though.

35:00.467 --> 35:02.832
Genesis, ooh!

35:02.907 --> 35:04.272
- On her backside!
- Jeez Louise!

35:04.347 --> 35:05.632
One of the more
awkward we've seen.

35:05.707 --> 35:06.639
Yeah.

35:06.714 --> 35:08.712
But scoreboard,
one froglet in.

35:08.787 --> 35:13.192
- And one from tying Melissa.
- Wow. Wow.

35:13.267 --> 35:15.032
Let me tell you, I'm really
impressed

35:15.107 --> 35:16.992
- with Genesis right now.
- She's great.

35:17.067 --> 35:18.479
She's doing well, I think.

35:18.554 --> 35:21.032
You go in there, grab it,
get out as soon as possible.

35:21.107 --> 35:22.432
She's doing it.

35:22.507 --> 35:24.472
However...
this is a big jump.

35:24.481 --> 35:27.032
This is the same spot where
Melissa almost fell in.

35:27.107 --> 35:28.712
Be careful now.

35:28.787 --> 35:29.992
Oh!

35:30.001 --> 35:31.232
She's going from the lily pad

35:31.307 --> 35:32.832
and she's going to have
to fight again.

35:32.907 --> 35:33.719
- Come on.
- Come on, now.

35:33.794 --> 35:35.399
- Dig deep.
- Fight.

35:35.474 --> 35:36.599
Golly.

35:36.674 --> 35:37.825
Come on, do it.

35:37.827 --> 35:40.639
You can, come on.
Get the knee up!

35:51.107 --> 35:52.079
She's clinging on, wow!

35:52.154 --> 35:53.912
- She won't quit.
- Wow.

35:53.987 --> 35:56.032
She'll be tied with Melissa
on two froglets

35:56.107 --> 35:57.752
if she can just
get that knee up.

35:57.827 --> 36:00.592
Genesis, how about it?

36:00.601 --> 36:02.519
8-bits of courage!

36:02.594 --> 36:03.832
That's two froglets.

36:03.841 --> 36:05.032
We'll have to wait and see

36:05.107 --> 36:06.072
if she got that
second froglet quicker

36:06.147 --> 36:08.112
than Melissa did.

36:08.187 --> 36:11.519
But getting one more froglet
knocks Melissa right out.

36:14.067 --> 36:15.232
- Woo!
- Wow.

36:15.241 --> 36:18.552
Genesis, battered but not down.

36:18.627 --> 36:20.839
- I'm loving this.
- Is she going turtle, Wayans?

36:20.914 --> 36:22.112
Is she going temple?
Turtle or temple?

36:22.187 --> 36:23.592
I'm thinking turtle.

36:23.667 --> 36:25.792
- Thinking turtle.
- But she might go temple.

36:25.867 --> 36:27.792
- [babbles]
- Might go turtle.

36:27.867 --> 36:29.232
I wouldn't go turtle.

36:29.307 --> 36:31.439
But she might go
temple again.

36:31.514 --> 36:32.759
- Oh, she's going temple.
- She's going temple.

36:32.834 --> 36:34.199
She's going temple.

36:34.274 --> 36:35.912
It's a safer bet for her

36:35.987 --> 36:37.392
with two froglets
to choose from,

36:37.467 --> 36:39.432
but she's still got to do
a bit of climbing here.

36:39.507 --> 36:41.832
She's had so many of these
battles where she's been

36:41.907 --> 36:43.712
halfway off and had to put
the knee up.

36:43.721 --> 36:46.832
These are really draining, and
that's a small lily pad.

36:46.841 --> 36:48.339
Nice. Two big jumps.

36:50.387 --> 36:52.559
Well, looks like she's
changing her mind again.

36:54.307 --> 36:56.399
Oh, she's going for the turtle.

36:56.474 --> 36:58.432
She changed her mind
about three times.

36:58.441 --> 37:00.072
She wants no part
of that temple.

37:00.147 --> 37:02.199
But this is a risky move,
I've got to say it.

37:02.274 --> 37:05.392
The turtle did not work out
so well for Melissa.

37:05.401 --> 37:08.632
The gator and the turtle corner
is a gauntlet for Froggers.

37:08.707 --> 37:11.439
A lot of Froggers go in,
they don't come out.

37:12.801 --> 37:14.672
Genesis has already
shown she won't let

37:14.747 --> 37:16.119
anything get in her way.

37:16.121 --> 37:17.952
She's proving something
here, Wayans.

37:18.027 --> 37:19.472
That's the face of
courage right there.

37:19.547 --> 37:22.079
Oh! Come on.
Now what do I do?

37:22.154 --> 37:23.512
Clock is ticking.

37:23.587 --> 37:26.399
Gotta go gator first.
It's a rough jump.

37:26.474 --> 37:28.272
Ah! Got it.

37:28.347 --> 37:28.999
She said got it.

37:29.074 --> 37:30.592
She do got it.

37:30.601 --> 37:33.032
I feel like she's come a long
way from Ribbit river.

37:33.107 --> 37:34.512
This is a different
Frogger altogether.

37:34.587 --> 37:36.512
Okay, one minute left,
is she going--

37:36.587 --> 37:38.952
Oh, and she's down.
It's over.

37:39.027 --> 37:41.632
Genesis has shown
the heart of a champion.

37:41.707 --> 37:44.032
We will go to the clock,
she has two froglets.

37:44.107 --> 37:46.079
Did she get them fast enough?

37:47.241 --> 37:49.199
Genesis takes the
lead from Melissa.

37:49.274 --> 37:50.872
They both got two froglets,

37:50.947 --> 37:53.992
but Genesis beat her
by nearly a minute.

37:54.067 --> 37:55.392
Now it's down to Kaytie.

37:55.467 --> 37:57.472
She'll need to rescue
three froglets

37:57.547 --> 38:00.752
or rescue two faster
than Genesis.

38:00.827 --> 38:01.912
Ready Frogger?

38:01.987 --> 38:02.752
I'm ready.

38:02.827 --> 38:04.119
Here we go.

38:06.987 --> 38:09.832
Welcome to the Kaytie show.

38:09.907 --> 38:11.952
Oh!
Ah.

38:12.027 --> 38:14.799
Pound for pound, one of our
most entertaining Froggers.

38:14.874 --> 38:17.032
Wildly unpredictable.

38:17.107 --> 38:19.152
I mean...

38:19.227 --> 38:22.192
She showed a lot
of determination in Frog City.

38:22.201 --> 38:24.952
And we might be about
to see that again from her.

38:25.027 --> 38:27.072
What does she have
up her sleeve here

38:27.147 --> 38:28.679
on Boss Toad temple?

38:28.754 --> 38:30.112
Going to the helipad.

38:30.187 --> 38:31.839
Same route as them.

38:31.914 --> 38:33.672
She doesn't do anything slow,
she doesn't do anything tame.

38:33.747 --> 38:35.632
You got it, you got it,
come on, you got it.

38:35.641 --> 38:37.079
Oh, I love this.

38:37.154 --> 38:40.392
This is textbook stuff.
There is no stopping Kaytie.

38:40.467 --> 38:41.679
She's a machine!

38:41.754 --> 38:43.832
Genesis should be worried.

38:43.907 --> 38:46.072
Kaytie is going for a ride

38:46.147 --> 38:47.232
It's all action with Kaytie.

38:47.307 --> 38:49.239
Non-stop kinetic energy.

38:50.787 --> 38:51.952
Woo!
Oh my God!

38:51.961 --> 38:53.072
- Oh, no!
- She dropped the froglet!

38:53.147 --> 38:54.719
Oh, it stayed on.

38:54.794 --> 38:56.112
Jeez Louise.

38:56.187 --> 38:58.072
- It almost fell off.
- Stay on the edge!

38:58.147 --> 39:00.032
Oh, that was so crazy!

39:00.107 --> 39:01.032
My goodness.

39:01.107 --> 39:02.339
Always unpredictable.

39:02.414 --> 39:04.712
- Chaotic Kaytie.
- Chaotic Kaytie.

39:04.787 --> 39:05.799
Strikes again.

39:05.874 --> 39:08.032
And that's one froglet banked.

39:08.107 --> 39:10.432
Wow! Easily the fastest
time we've seen tonight.

39:10.507 --> 39:12.832
Kaytie is on fire.

39:12.907 --> 39:14.112
And if she gets this froglet,

39:14.187 --> 39:15.712
she can win this whole
thing right now.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.632
That's number two.
If she can take that thing home,

39:17.707 --> 39:21.752
I'm pretty sure
she'll be in the lead.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.392
Tosses it, does it roll off?

39:23.467 --> 39:24.799
Oh, it almost went
in the basinet.

39:24.874 --> 39:26.792
Genesis and Melissa
looking on.

39:26.801 --> 39:28.552
Clearly worried from
the sideline,

39:28.561 --> 39:29.905
and I don't blame them.

39:29.981 --> 39:32.879
If she makes the jump,
she can end this right now.

39:35.187 --> 39:37.872
- Oh...
- Oh, no!

39:37.947 --> 39:41.552
Oh, and it is over!

39:41.627 --> 39:42.799
- Genesis won!
- Wow.

39:42.874 --> 39:44.312
Oh my God, I can't
believe this.

39:44.387 --> 39:48.632
And Genesis Codina
wins $10,000.

39:48.707 --> 39:51.352
Oh my God, this is crazy.

39:51.361 --> 39:54.112
Melissa and Genesis
both got two froglets,

39:54.187 --> 39:57.232
but Genesis did it faster.

39:57.241 --> 39:59.592
Toughness personified.

39:59.667 --> 40:02.112
It is Genesis
who has just defeated

40:02.187 --> 40:03.832
the Boss Toad temple.

40:03.907 --> 40:06.272
She is now headed for the
ultimate Frogger championship

40:06.347 --> 40:09.312
and the chance to win
$100,000.

40:09.387 --> 40:10.912
What a great night
for Frogger.

40:10.987 --> 40:12.432
I'm getting choked
up in here.

40:12.441 --> 40:13.839
Congratulations.
