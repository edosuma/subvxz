00:46.088 --> 00:47.756
Ow!

00:50.968 --> 00:52.636
Hey, Ed?

00:53.846 --> 00:56.765
- You OK?
- There's blood.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.813
It's only a paper cut.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.524
Uh, listen, Ed. I need to talk to you.

01:20.038 --> 01:23.959
Ed, I... This is never easy.

01:24.543 --> 01:27.963
And everybody down here
sure likes you a lot, Funschie.

01:28.046 --> 01:32.301
And I know it's tough
cos you're new to this area.

01:32.384 --> 01:35.721
Ed, I'm sorry, but I'm
gonna have to let you go.

01:35.804 --> 01:40.851
I mean, your work is first-rate
and, like I said, you're a good guy.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.646
But you know the story:
cutbacks and seniority.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.858
And you're a low man on the pole.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.198
Could I work part time?

01:58.410 --> 02:01.705
The guys took up a collection today.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.082
It's a hundred bucks.

02:07.461 --> 02:11.006
Look, why don't you stay on
till the end of the week?

03:30.461 --> 03:33.006
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 03 - Blood

04:28.810 --> 04:31.980
- Is there room here for me?
- I think we can make some.

04:32.064 --> 04:34.149
Thank you.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.205
Excuse me.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.083
It's OK.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.870
- Hey, Ralph. How you doin'?
- All right.

05:27.953 --> 05:30.038
Thanks for coming at short notice.

05:30.122 --> 05:35.794
I realise the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit
mainly profiles murder suspects still at large.

05:35.878 --> 05:41.049
It must be odd being asked to profile
our suspects, all of whom are dead.

05:42.634 --> 05:46.096
I am relieved the Bureau
answered our request and sent you.

05:46.180 --> 05:51.310
In all honesty, Agent Mulder, whatever's
going on here is way over our heads.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.278
The suspect's body is out on the sidewalk.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.823
We're holding the security guard
who shot him.

06:04.907 --> 06:10.579
The witnesses in the elevator are down at the
hospital. Talk to them whenever you're ready.

06:15.125 --> 06:19.213
I've asked all the businesses
in the building to close for the day.

06:19.296 --> 06:24.510
We've done our best to preserve the area
for you. We've photographed the scene.

06:24.593 --> 06:28.889
The area's been sketched,
but we haven't dusted for prints yet.

06:28.972 --> 06:32.601
We wanted to wait for you
before collecting further evidence.

06:32.684 --> 06:35.395
Was this damaged during the incident?

06:40.234 --> 06:42.945
- I'll find out.
- May I see the suspect?

06:45.739 --> 06:49.201
Things like this aren't
supposed to happen here.

06:49.284 --> 06:54.915
A 42-year-old real-estate agent murders four
strangers? That shouldn't happen anywhere.

06:54.998 --> 06:58.836
Since colonial times there's only
been three murders in this area.

06:58.919 --> 07:02.756
In the last six months,
seven people have killed 22.

07:02.840 --> 07:08.804
Per capita, that's higher than the combined
homicide rate of Detroit, DC and Los Angeles.

07:08.887 --> 07:14.560
This town is not any of those places. In
Franklin, you never have to pull off the road...

07:14.643 --> 07:18.355
...to make way for a celebrity
driving with a gun to his head.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.108
In each incident, the suspect was killed?

07:21.191 --> 07:23.610
Suicide. By cop.

07:23.694 --> 07:26.196
Each incident occurred in a public place.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.283
The suspect went crazy and refused to desist.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.827
Officers used deadly force to save lives.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.997
Were autopsies conducted
for substance abuse?

07:35.080 --> 07:39.835
This town is mainly made up of apple and
cherry growers. Folks here don't drink much.

07:39.918 --> 07:44.298
They certainly don't do drugs.
The coroner's tests were negative.

07:44.381 --> 07:49.386
This is Dispatch. Can you provide
additional backup for unit 42?

07:54.600 --> 07:57.603
Played softball
with this guy over Labor Day.

07:58.604 --> 08:03.901
He was one of those nice guys. Couldn't play
and didn't bitch about being in right field.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.153
What's wrong with right field?

08:06.236 --> 08:10.741
Always the first to shake hands at the end
of the game, whether he'd won or lost.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.368
You gotta have an arm to play right field.

08:13.452 --> 08:17.414
Bought a round of beers afterwards,
even though he didn't drink.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.708
I played right field.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.378
Let's have this analysed by the Bureau's lab.

08:24.546 --> 08:27.341
What the hell could bring anyone to do this?

08:32.095 --> 08:36.350
- I wanna go home.
- Don't be in such a hurry.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.602
You'll just have to wait
for the man to finish, OK?

08:41.647 --> 08:44.983
- Mommy...
- Baby, you're bleeding.

08:45.067 --> 08:48.111
Come on, tilt your head back.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.781
I told you to leave it alone. OK?

08:51.865 --> 08:55.035
Now, don't touch it or it'll bleed again.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.287
Tilt your head back. There you go.

08:58.372 --> 09:01.250
Lucky we had a Kleenex, eh?

09:01.333 --> 09:03.460
Good girl.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.288
Hey! Hey!

09:39.371 --> 09:41.456
What the hell's wrong with you?

09:48.297 --> 09:54.052
Mass murderers are divided into two
classifications: the spree killer and the serial.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.140
The violent outburst in a public locale...

09:58.223 --> 10:01.435
...and the suspect's disregard
for anonymity or survival...

10:01.518 --> 10:05.063
...define the Franklin incidents
as spree killings.

10:06.398 --> 10:10.569
The confounding element of these profiles
is that, given their backgrounds...

10:10.652 --> 10:13.280
...the perpetrators would be, statistically...

10:13.363 --> 10:18.118
...more likely the victims of violent crimes
rather than the originators.

10:18.202 --> 10:21.747
The killers were all middle-income,
responsible people...

10:21.830 --> 10:24.541
...none with a history of violence.

10:24.625 --> 10:28.879
Relatives reported only minor
displays of dysfunctional behaviour:

10:28.962 --> 10:32.925
...sleep disorders, headaches,
eating difficulties.

10:33.008 --> 10:38.722
But witnesses did report the last suspect
displayed a claustrophobic reaction.

10:42.476 --> 10:46.021
I'm convinced
an outside factor is responsible...

10:46.104 --> 10:50.442
...but I must concede frustration
as to a determination of the cause.

10:50.526 --> 10:54.446
A residue on the fingers of
the most recent perpetrator was analysed...

10:54.530 --> 10:59.785
...and reported to be an undefined but
non-toxic organic chemical found on plants...

10:59.868 --> 11:02.913
...perhaps remaining from gardening.

11:02.996 --> 11:08.794
There have been reported abductee
paranoia in UFO mass-abduction cases.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.963
I was wondering when you'd get to that.

11:11.046 --> 11:14.466
I find no evidence of this to be the case.

11:14.550 --> 11:16.927
The single connecting trace evidence...

11:17.010 --> 11:21.181
...is the destruction of
an electronic device at the crime scene.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.935
A pager, a fax machine.

11:25.894 --> 11:29.481
A cellular phone, a gas pump digital display.

11:30.774 --> 11:36.321
In all honesty, Scully, I've never had
a more difficult time developing a profile.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.450
There is no way to know who will be a killer.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.579
Or who will be killed.

11:57.301 --> 11:58.969
Hello?

12:03.390 --> 12:05.225
Hello?

12:05.309 --> 12:08.020
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

12:08.979 --> 12:12.441
I called earlier.
A deadline came up at work.

12:13.358 --> 12:16.820
If it's ready, I'll just
pay you and be out of here.

12:16.904 --> 12:20.532
How did you manage to break that, anyhow?

12:20.616 --> 12:22.701
Oh, it's a long story.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.579
- Did you fix it?
- It's fixed.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.040
What do I owe you?

12:28.123 --> 12:32.377
I'll tell you. In fixing that,
I found some other problems.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.923
Serious problems, Mrs McRoberts.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.051
Come back here. I'll show you.

12:42.638 --> 12:46.183
I'm sorry... My husband's waiting for me.

12:47.059 --> 12:49.269
- I have to go.
- OK.

12:49.353 --> 12:53.357
But you ain't gonna go very far
unless you get this fixed.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.733
Come here.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.983
This is a diagnostic test of your engine.

13:36.066 --> 13:40.362
You're supposed to have an output
of 168 horses at 6200rpms.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.866
You're nowhere near that.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.871
Come over here.

13:48.954 --> 13:52.374
Next to me. I want you to take a look at this.

13:53.834 --> 13:57.504
Well, first of all, you're leaking oil like crazy.

13:57.588 --> 14:01.341
Your throw rods are chattering,
valves need adjustment...

14:02.801 --> 14:05.596
A couple of engine mounts
should be replaced.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.685
To tell you the truth...

14:28.452 --> 14:31.038
If you don't believe me, take a look here.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.886
Aarghh!

16:12.055 --> 16:15.934
Agent Mulder?
Larry Winter, county supervisor.

16:16.602 --> 16:18.604
Uh, pardon my rubber.

16:18.687 --> 16:22.858
Can you tell me if this murder
is more of the same?

16:22.941 --> 16:25.485
They don't seem to be connected.

16:25.569 --> 16:28.530
Well, should I be relieved or more scared?

16:28.614 --> 16:31.742
I mean, is this the start of copycat killers?

16:31.825 --> 16:34.995
Larry, it's not a copy
of the other homicides.

16:35.078 --> 16:39.041
This wasn't a public area.
The suspect fled, covering his tracks.

16:40.542 --> 16:44.296
The killer appears
not to have had a premeditated weapon.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.050
They are connected.

16:50.219 --> 16:51.845
- Mrs McRoberts?
- Yes.

16:51.929 --> 16:56.850
This is Sheriff Spencer. I'm Agent
Fox Mulder with the FBI. May we come in?

16:56.934 --> 16:59.102
- I'm late for work.
- You can blame me.

17:04.483 --> 17:08.694
- Been having some car trouble?
- That's my husband's department.

17:08.779 --> 17:13.367
- May I speak with him?
- He took the car to Pittsburgh for a meeting.

17:13.450 --> 17:17.621
- Is it OK if I have my breakfast?
- It's the day's most important meal.

17:29.424 --> 17:34.847
Um, this invoice was, uh, signed by you.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.600
Did you pick up the car last night?

17:41.728 --> 17:43.814
Yes.

17:51.905 --> 17:56.702
Can you describe to me exactly how
the dashboard read-out was damaged?

17:59.037 --> 18:01.039
Mrs McRoberts?

18:03.876 --> 18:05.544
I did it.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.339
- I broke it.
- Why?

18:12.342 --> 18:14.678
Mrs McRoberts?

18:15.929 --> 18:19.558
Did you see something in the read-out?

18:22.311 --> 18:24.021
Mrs McRoberts?

18:28.275 --> 18:29.943
I can help.

18:33.739 --> 18:35.657
Mrs McRoberts?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.329
- Stop!
- No!

18:51.173 --> 18:54.760
Anomalies were found
during postmortem analysis...

18:54.843 --> 18:58.388
...that were undetected in previous autopsies.

18:58.472 --> 19:01.892
Levels of adrenaline are high
in cases of violent death...

19:01.975 --> 19:05.270
...twice as much as in victims of natural death.

19:05.354 --> 19:08.482
This subject's levels were 200 times normal.

19:09.858 --> 19:14.738
The adrenal gland displayed extensive
adrenal haemorrhage, yet not from disease...

19:14.821 --> 19:17.699
...but rather from wear.

19:17.783 --> 19:23.247
Other physiological evidence present
indicated episodes of intense phobia.

19:23.330 --> 19:27.167
Analysis of the vitreous humour,
extracted from the eyeball...

19:27.251 --> 19:33.715
...indicated the presence of high concentration
of an undetermined chemical compound.

19:33.799 --> 19:35.592
This compound, at its base...

19:35.676 --> 19:40.556
...is similar to the substance analysed
earlier on a perpetrator's finger.

19:40.639 --> 19:44.434
Although further qualitative
analysis must be performed...

19:44.518 --> 19:48.480
...it is my opinion that this chemical,
when reacting with adrenaline...

19:48.564 --> 19:51.984
...and other compounds
secreted during phobic episodes...

19:52.067 --> 19:56.822
...creates a substance similar
to lysergic acid diethylamide:

19:56.905 --> 19:58.991
...LSD.

20:10.335 --> 20:13.213
Pardon me. I'd like to apply for a job.

20:13.297 --> 20:16.633
Sorry. They're not accepting
applications at this time.

20:42.576 --> 20:46.163
Sir, may we ask you
to sign up for the blood drive?

20:49.833 --> 20:51.919
Are you all right?

20:53.670 --> 20:55.339
Sir?

22:51.955 --> 22:54.041
Hmm.

22:55.834 --> 23:01.256
In our April edition of The Lone Gunman, we
ran an article on the CIA's new CCDTH-2138...

23:01.340 --> 23:03.926
...fibreoptic-lens micro-video camera.

23:04.009 --> 23:06.970
Small enough to be
placed on the back of a fly.

23:07.054 --> 23:10.057
Imagine being a fly
on the wall of the Oval Office.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.351
Been there. Done that.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.686
That is a Eurasian cluster fly.

23:14.770 --> 23:20.150
They infest vegetation like apples or cherries
and can inflict a lot of damage to crops.

23:20.234 --> 23:22.945
It's been irradiated to control propagation.

23:23.028 --> 23:26.365
Or... agents of competing
agricultural corporations...

23:26.448 --> 23:32.454
...posing as Franklin City employees, are
releasing fertile flies to destroy the crop.

23:32.538 --> 23:34.748
No. This bug's been nuked.

23:34.832 --> 23:37.084
It was a fine effort, though.

23:37.835 --> 23:41.296
Have you ever come across
this chemical compound?

23:41.380 --> 23:43.465
LSDM?

23:43.549 --> 23:47.553
Obviously you haven't read
our August edition of TLG.

23:47.636 --> 23:53.100
Oh, I'm sorry, boys. It arrived the same day
as my subscription to Celebrity Skin.

23:53.183 --> 23:55.269
Come over here.

24:02.067 --> 24:06.405
- So, Mulder, where's your little partner?
- She wouldn't come.

24:06.488 --> 24:10.742
- She's afraid of her love for you.
- She's tasty.

24:10.826 --> 24:14.246
Frohike, it's men like you
that give perversion a bad name.

24:14.329 --> 24:17.166
Here. Toxic pesticides.

24:17.958 --> 24:21.628
The chemical in that report
is called lysergic dimethrin...

24:21.712 --> 24:25.507
...an unreleased experimental
synthetic botanical insecticide.

24:25.591 --> 24:29.219
- It acts as a natural pheromone.
- LSDM is sprayed on the plant...

24:29.303 --> 24:33.932
...which invokes a fear response in the pest:
"Get out of here. There's danger."

24:34.016 --> 24:37.394
- The insect leaves the plant.
- Why won't they release it?

24:37.477 --> 24:40.355
Is it possible it affects
humans in the same way?

24:40.439 --> 24:42.774
Possible?

24:42.858 --> 24:44.943
Let me show you something.

24:46.987 --> 24:49.907
This is actual newsreel
footage taken in the '50s.

24:49.990 --> 24:55.787
They're spraying DDT, a chemical the
government did release and determine safe.

24:55.871 --> 25:00.834
30 years later they found out women exposed
to it had higher rates of breast cancer.

25:00.918 --> 25:04.796
They convinced local officials
it was safe to spray on children.

25:04.880 --> 25:11.261
It took a decade of bureaucratic and
industry heel-dragging before it was banned.

25:11.345 --> 25:16.308
- Different chemicals. Same stunts.
- They just learned how not to be so obvious.

25:16.391 --> 25:19.478
Hey, Frohike, can I borrow those?

25:19.561 --> 25:21.855
If I can have Scully's phone number.

26:44.938 --> 26:49.943
Stealth helicopters? Experimental pesticides
responsible for violent behaviour?

26:50.027 --> 26:53.697
I saw the chopper from two
different locations. Look at my skin.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.492
Feel my hair. The insecticide is still on me.

26:56.575 --> 26:59.119
I've checked up on you.

26:59.203 --> 27:02.581
You have a penchant for "spooky" evidence.

27:02.664 --> 27:06.376
- Don't start that crap. Don't divert blame.
- Hang on a second...

27:06.460 --> 27:08.587
If you're the one who's responsible...

27:08.670 --> 27:12.591
...the sooner you take responsibility,
the sooner people will stop dying.

27:12.674 --> 27:16.136
The killers all resided
near heavily sprayed areas.

27:16.220 --> 27:21.934
You don't live here, Mulder.
I live here. I have my heart in this town.

27:22.017 --> 27:25.354
I have three children.
I'm not gonna dump poison on them.

27:25.437 --> 27:28.524
Yeah, well, if it's so safe,
why was it done in secret?

27:28.607 --> 27:33.403
- What kind of a crusade are you on?
- Answer the question. Are we spraying?

27:37.407 --> 27:41.537
This county lives on money
generated from its crops.

27:41.620 --> 27:43.872
Irradiated flies were not effective.

27:43.956 --> 27:47.960
The delays to get approval would
have caused millions in crop damage.

27:48.043 --> 27:50.879
Look at the hell they raised over Malathion.

27:50.963 --> 27:54.883
Meanwhile, people's lives were
being ruined by a damn bug.

27:54.967 --> 27:59.054
Ruined? 23 people are dead.

27:59.137 --> 28:03.475
There's no proof the spray caused
violent behaviour. It was proven safe.

28:03.559 --> 28:06.186
By who? Who proved it to you?

28:16.071 --> 28:18.657
I'm sorry, Mulder, he's right.

28:18.740 --> 28:22.119
I'd love to say I flew 300 miles
in the middle of the night...

28:22.202 --> 28:25.581
...to prove you're about to become
the next Charles Manson.

28:25.664 --> 28:28.709
But I find little physiological evidence...

28:28.792 --> 28:33.630
...that states that LSDM has toxically
affected you, even after massive ingestion.

28:33.714 --> 28:37.259
Your own autopsy says
the killer had chemical anomalies.

28:37.342 --> 28:42.431
Yes, but you are proof that
it wasn't from exposure to LSDM.

28:42.514 --> 28:44.892
May I see that chart, Agent Scully?

28:44.975 --> 28:46.977
Sure.

28:47.060 --> 28:50.105
Look here. These are normal...

28:58.906 --> 29:01.992
... perhaps subjected
to repeated LSDM spraying.

29:02.075 --> 29:06.079
Scully, are you familiar
with subliminal messages?

29:06.163 --> 29:10.417
You mean like... sex and
ice cubes in liquor ads?

29:10.501 --> 29:12.753
- That's paranoia.
- No, it's a fact.

29:12.836 --> 29:17.341
Stores use subliminal messages in
their ambient music to deter shoplifting.

29:17.424 --> 29:22.304
The Russians use electro-encephalographic
techniques to control behaviour.

29:22.387 --> 29:29.061
- How is this connected with the spraying?
- Electronic devices were always destroyed.

29:29.144 --> 29:32.022
- I'm still waiting.
- The insecticide LSDM...

29:32.105 --> 29:34.399
...is known to cause fear in cluster flies.

29:34.483 --> 29:39.279
What if it causes the same reaction
in humans? All the perpetrators were phobic.

29:39.363 --> 29:43.659
Taber was claustrophobic. McRoberts's
husband said she had a fear of rape.

29:43.742 --> 29:47.663
The insecticide heightened
their phobia to an unbearable level.

29:47.746 --> 29:53.001
The electronic devices relayed messages that
told them what to do in order to alleviate it.

29:53.085 --> 29:57.047
- The messages were relayed purposely.
- By who?

30:13.397 --> 30:16.567
He's probably one of those people
that thinks Elvis is dead.

30:16.650 --> 30:21.738
Mulder, I was wrong. Exposure to
the insecticide does induce paranoia.

30:22.865 --> 30:26.618
I think this area is being subjected
to a controlled experiment.

30:26.702 --> 30:29.788
Controlled by who? By the government?

30:29.872 --> 30:32.249
By a corporation? By Reticulans?

30:32.332 --> 30:38.046
They've done it before. DDT in the '50s, Agent
Orange, germ warfare on unsuspecting areas.

30:38.130 --> 30:43.468
Yes, but why, Mulder? Why intentionally
create a populace that destroys itself?

30:43.552 --> 30:45.554
Fear.

30:45.637 --> 30:50.225
It's the oldest tool of power. If you're
distracted by fear of those around you...

30:50.309 --> 30:53.979
...it keeps you from seeing
the actions of those above.

30:57.107 --> 30:59.902
I just had a talk with Mr Winter.

30:59.985 --> 31:02.529
I've persuaded him to a compromise.

31:03.405 --> 31:05.491
He's agreed to stop the spraying...

31:05.574 --> 31:09.661
...and to blood testing extensively
of people exposed to the spray area.

31:09.745 --> 31:10.954
But?

31:11.038 --> 31:17.294
But the official explanation for the testing
cannot be linked to the side effects of LSDM.

31:22.674 --> 31:25.385
Franklin and Venango Counties
are participating...

31:25.469 --> 31:29.014
...in an important nationwide
study on cholesterol.

31:29.097 --> 31:31.391
Volunteers will be coming to your door...

31:31.475 --> 31:35.771
...or you may report at your convenience
to Franklin Community General.

31:35.854 --> 31:39.149
The procedure is very simple and painless.

31:39.233 --> 31:45.239
Just a little prick on the fingertip, and your
participation is complete-and appreciated.

31:45.948 --> 31:50.285
So remember, cholesterol
screening can save your life.

31:51.328 --> 31:54.873
So when those volunteers
come to your door, answer readily,

31:54.957 --> 31:58.877
or you may report at your convenience
to Franklin Community General.

33:24.338 --> 33:30.010
And the test results on the blood samples,
did you double-check? Are you sure?

33:30.093 --> 33:31.762
Uh-huh.

33:33.096 --> 33:34.973
Last area just reported in.

33:35.057 --> 33:38.393
OK, these are the sectors
that have tested negative.

33:38.477 --> 33:43.857
These people, for one reason or another,
haven't checked out. There's about 25.

33:44.233 --> 33:46.318
Only seven more to go.

33:49.488 --> 33:51.573
This is odd.

33:57.788 --> 34:00.290
Frustrated Jehovah's Witness?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.086
Door's unlocked.

35:00.058 --> 35:02.144
Here it is.

35:02.769 --> 35:05.606
Edward Funsch. Age 52. No diploma.

35:05.689 --> 35:09.943
No vehicle or driver's licence.
Navy radio man. Wife died ten years ago.

35:10.027 --> 35:12.863
No kids. No known family. Just been laid off.

35:12.946 --> 35:17.367
- Medical history?
- Nothing. He hasn't seen a doctor in decades.

35:17.451 --> 35:21.830
- When was the blood tester here?
- About 10.30 this morning.

35:21.914 --> 35:23.999
10.30?

35:26.960 --> 35:29.379
The blood test.

35:30.672 --> 35:33.800
I know what he's afraid of.

35:33.884 --> 35:36.136
And I know where he's going.

35:47.147 --> 35:49.650
Hey, wait. Stop! Stop!

35:49.733 --> 35:52.027
Stop! Hey!

35:52.778 --> 35:55.489
All right, all right. Hold on a second.

35:57.157 --> 35:59.409
Thank you.

36:29.606 --> 36:31.733
- Pardon me.
- Wait for the next stop.

36:31.817 --> 36:34.862
- Please, I'm on the wrong bus.
- Wait for the next stop.

36:34.945 --> 36:37.781
Open the door! Open the door!

36:37.865 --> 36:39.658
Open the door, dammit!

36:44.913 --> 36:49.334
C-1, this is X-ray-4.
Negative on that north-south line.

36:49.418 --> 36:50.878
Copy that.

36:50.961 --> 36:53.547
If he's on it, it's gonna be this line.

36:54.965 --> 36:58.093
- Here it comes.
- Get the uniforms out of sight.

37:32.628 --> 37:35.005
Have you seen this man?

37:36.548 --> 37:39.468
I picked him up.
Drove four feet and he went apewire.

37:39.551 --> 37:42.846
- Where'd you let him out?
- Near the college.

37:43.430 --> 37:47.309
- We'll have to wait him out.
- I don't think he's waiting.

38:44.575 --> 38:48.120
- Scully, anything?
- Nothing.

40:14.206 --> 40:16.750
Get down! Get down! Everybody down!

40:16.834 --> 40:19.086
Get down! Get down!

40:21.004 --> 40:25.342
Everybody remain calm.
Stay away from this building.

40:26.385 --> 40:28.512
Stay down.

40:28.595 --> 40:31.056
Take cover.

40:45.904 --> 40:50.492
I've seen that. I've seen that and
I don't want to see that again, baby.

41:02.671 --> 41:05.132
All units, forthwith. Franklin College.

41:05.215 --> 41:07.843
Shots fired. Send emergency vehicles.

42:01.146 --> 42:02.940
Put it down!

42:03.023 --> 42:05.317
Put it down!

42:05.400 --> 42:08.612
- Don't kill me.
- Then put it down, Ed.

42:09.154 --> 42:12.574
I can't. They won't let me.

42:12.908 --> 42:15.869
I know they won't, Ed.
I know they won't let you.

42:18.872 --> 42:20.958
Then...

42:23.126 --> 42:25.838
You make me put it down, then.

42:28.215 --> 42:30.300
You do it.

42:32.010 --> 42:34.096
If you don't put it down...

42:35.639 --> 42:37.724
...I'm gonna have to shoot you.

42:39.268 --> 42:41.770
Or you're gonna have to shoot me.

42:46.525 --> 42:49.736
There's gonna be blood everywhere.

42:51.905 --> 42:54.533
Oh... Ah.

43:02.624 --> 43:04.001
Agh!

43:18.765 --> 43:21.476
- Don't kill me.
- It's all right.

43:38.076 --> 43:41.163
Agent Scully will
examine him at the hospital.

43:41.246 --> 43:44.416
I want unrestricted access
to him for questioning.

43:44.500 --> 43:48.670
Mulder, you know more about
what happened to him than he does.

44:24.623 --> 44:26.708
Scully.

44:26.792 --> 44:29.378
Hello?

44:29.461 --> 44:31.547
Mulder, is that you?

44:31.630 --> 44:33.715
Mulder, where are you?

44:35.551 --> 44:37.761
Mulder?

44:37.845 --> 44:40.138
Mulder, where are you?

44:40.138 --> 44:45.477
