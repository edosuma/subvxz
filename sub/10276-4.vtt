Hey, hi there.

01:11.939 --> 01:14.640
Is this seat free?
Oh, sorry.

01:14.642 --> 01:15.908
I'm saving it for a friend.

01:15.910 --> 01:18.677
Oh, of course.
Never mind.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.612
Hiya.
Can I sit here?

01:20.614 --> 01:22.114
Sure, it's all yours.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.249
We're just leaving
for band practice.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.586
Oh...
Thanks.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.721
Princess Zooey?

01:29.723 --> 01:31.723
You know me?
Not yet.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.158
But I remember when
you toured the school.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.660
I'm Sofia.

01:34.662 --> 01:35.828
Would you like
to sit with me?

01:35.830 --> 01:37.729
That would be nice.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.698
It's a little weird
being in a school.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.202
Well, my family used to
travel all the time.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.671
So I just had private
tutors until now.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.740
So this is your first day
of real school ever?

01:48.742 --> 01:50.676
Yep. I've crossed
the crystal desert,

01:50.678 --> 01:52.644
ridden down lava rapids,

01:52.646 --> 01:54.646
and gone swimming with
ice sharks in winter,

01:54.648 --> 01:56.648
but I've never stayed
in one place long enough

01:56.650 --> 01:58.784
to go to school
or call someplace home.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.753
Or, you know,
make any real friends.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.055
I'll make sure
you meet everyone.

02:03.057 --> 02:06.125
Hey, guys, this is Zooey.
It's her first day.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.192
these are my friends--

02:07.194 --> 02:08.760
Hildegard...
Welcome.

02:08.762 --> 02:09.995
Clio...
It's good to meet you.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.130
Kari...
Hey there.

02:11.132 --> 02:12.898
and Lakshmi.
Hello, Zooey.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.000
Nice to meet you all.

02:18.171 --> 02:19.705
I love your pin.

02:19.707 --> 02:20.873
Oh, thanks.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.674
I found it when
I was pearl diving

02:22.676 --> 02:24.643
off the coast
of West Rubinia.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.178
And it was underneath
an electric eel.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.647
So it was not easy to get.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.984
For diving, you just need
a special...

02:31.986 --> 02:33.719
( door crashes open )

02:33.721 --> 02:35.821
You'll never believe
what I found-- a meteor!

02:35.823 --> 02:37.689
( excited murmurs )
It's a rock that fell

02:37.691 --> 02:38.957
all the way from outer space.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.693
Um, actually,
it's called a "meteor"

02:41.695 --> 02:43.061
when it streaks
through the sky.

02:43.063 --> 02:44.129
But once it lands on earth,

02:44.131 --> 02:45.764
it's called a "meteorite."

02:45.766 --> 02:46.899
So that's a meteorite.

02:48.101 --> 02:50.102
Who are you?
I'm Zooey. I'm new.

02:50.104 --> 02:52.804
Well, Zooey,

02:52.806 --> 02:54.873
please don't interrupt
me again, okay?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.675
But, I didn't.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.810
I was talking
when you walked up.

02:58.812 --> 03:02.147
Excuse me,
but I'm still talking.

03:02.149 --> 03:05.918
Please wait your turn.

03:05.920 --> 03:09.788
Now, who wants to hold
my <i> meteor </i> first?

03:09.790 --> 03:11.823
Me first.       Me, me!
I do.

03:11.825 --> 03:15.127
Zooey, wait!
Amber...

03:15.129 --> 03:17.196
Oh, you can
hold it too, Sofia.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.730
Just wait your turn.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.265
Lakshmi, you first.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.835
Sorry about that.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.838
I thought I was finally
starting to make friends

03:26.840 --> 03:29.174
until that princess came up,
interrupted me,

03:29.176 --> 03:30.809
and then blamed me for it.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.077
Who is she, anyway?

03:32.079 --> 03:34.479
SOFIA:
That's my sister Amber.

03:34.481 --> 03:35.814
Oh.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.049
She's usually friendlier.

03:37.051 --> 03:40.018
Listen, I was
the new girl once too.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.221
And I know it's hard,
but I promise

03:42.223 --> 03:43.755
it'll get easier.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.124

04:44.818 --> 04:46.551
I don't play any sports.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.887

start a club.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.156
Ooh, what kind of club?

04:51.158 --> 04:53.892
Well, you like going

04:53.894 --> 04:55.193
How about
an adventure club?

04:55.195 --> 04:56.962
That's perfect!

04:56.964 --> 04:59.931
I'll start a princess

05:57.391 --> 06:01.393
Well, we won't know
until we ask them.

06:01.395 --> 06:04.429
So, if you join
the Princess Adventure Club,

06:04.431 --> 06:07.466
not only do you get to go on
amazing adventures after school,

06:07.468 --> 06:10.268
you also get your very own
gold caribiner.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.504
Ooh...
What's a carabiner?

06:12.506 --> 06:14.272
You can hook it
onto anything.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.508
Plus, there's
a screwdriver
hidden in this end.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.976
And over here is
a fan.

06:19.445 --> 06:21.546
I would love
to join your club.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.547
I'm in.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.583
Great. Super.
Thank you.

06:24.585 --> 06:27.552
Don't forget to take
a parent permission form.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.621
Two more members.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.356
Oh, there's Amber.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.891
I bet she'll want
to join too.
Wait!

06:32.893 --> 06:34.493
I don't want <i> her </i>
in the club.
But...

06:34.495 --> 06:36.395
If she's there,
she'll just turn it

06:36.397 --> 06:38.363
into the Amber
Adventure Club,

06:38.365 --> 06:40.399
and I'll be
left out again.

06:40.401 --> 06:41.466
Zooey, come back.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.535
Wow, what did Amber
do to her?

06:43.537 --> 06:45.337
They got off
to a bad start.

06:45.339 --> 06:47.139
I know they can be friends.

06:47.141 --> 06:48.507
I've just got to
convince Zooey

06:48.509 --> 06:51.543
to give Amber
a second chance.

06:51.545 --> 06:54.179
Welcome to the Princess
Adventure Club's

06:54.181 --> 06:55.447
first adventure.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.681
Climb aboard, everyone.

07:00.319 --> 07:01.520
Where are we going?

07:01.522 --> 07:04.389
To the misty forests
of Outer Marttinos.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.525
Ooh, sounds exciting.
Uh-huh.

07:06.527 --> 07:09.428
Let's adventure!

07:14.600 --> 07:16.368
ZOOEY:
We're gonna be going fast,

07:16.370 --> 07:17.702
so keep your eyes open
for mist.

07:17.704 --> 07:20.205
KARI: What's so special
about the mist?

07:20.207 --> 07:22.541
It's not just mist,
it's <i> twist-mist!</i>

07:22.543 --> 07:23.708
You'll see.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.345
Whoo!
All right!

07:27.347 --> 07:29.414
There's some.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.516
Amazing.
Whoa!

07:31.518 --> 07:34.252
If you're quick, you can
grab some in your canteen

07:34.254 --> 07:35.587
to take home--
watch.

07:39.325 --> 07:40.459
Wow.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.627
Zooey, this is
really fun.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.329
I'm so glad
you think so.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.198
You know who else
would think so?

07:46.200 --> 07:47.532
Who?
Amber.

07:47.534 --> 07:50.402
Ugh, I already
told you, Sofia.

07:50.404 --> 07:52.270
I know, but she's
really great

07:52.272 --> 07:53.371
once you get to know her.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.173
Also, she's my sister,

07:55.175 --> 07:56.641
and you're my
new friend.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.478
So it would be nice
if you guys could
be friends too.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.379
Okay, I'll think about it.

08:03.382 --> 08:05.250
KARI:
Zooey, this is awesome!

08:05.252 --> 08:07.385
Whoo!

08:07.387 --> 08:11.256
It was so much fun,
and look what we brought back.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.294
GIRLS:
Whoa... Incredible.
What are they?

08:16.296 --> 08:18.530
Does it matter?
I must have them.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.232
Catch them, Clio.
Hurry!

08:20.234 --> 08:21.466
What's everyone
talking about?

08:21.468 --> 08:23.201
Zooey's Princess
Adventure Club.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.636
We have to join, Amber.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.538
Yes, we do.

08:26.540 --> 08:30.308
Huh, a Princess
Adventure Club?

08:30.310 --> 08:32.344
I heard all about
your club...

08:32.346 --> 08:33.545
( whispering )
Zooey.
Uh, Zooey.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.714
And luckily for you,
I want to be in it.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.549
So do I.
Me too.

08:37.551 --> 08:40.418
Great! Welcome to the
Princess Adventure Club.

08:40.420 --> 08:41.686
( gasps )

08:41.688 --> 08:44.222
More members,
more friends.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.690
We'll meet
after school tomorrow

08:45.692 --> 08:47.259
for the next adventure.

08:47.261 --> 08:48.693
Great.
See you tomorrow.

08:51.330 --> 08:53.532
So, I heard
you started a club.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.600
I'm sorry,
the club is full.

08:55.602 --> 08:57.602
What?
It is?

08:57.604 --> 08:59.604
Since when?
Since just now.

08:59.606 --> 09:01.540
Sorry.
You don't sound sorry.

09:01.542 --> 09:05.610
You said you were going
to let her in, Zooey.

09:05.612 --> 09:08.480
I said I'd think
about it, and I did.

09:08.482 --> 09:10.715
Amber really wasn't
nice to me, Sofia.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.685
And I don't want her
in my club.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.688
Oh...

09:16.690 --> 09:19.591
AMBER:
Oh, here, use the crowbar.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.393
Amber?

09:21.395 --> 09:24.563
Your new friend isn't
very friendly, Sofia.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.531
( sighs )
The thing is,

09:26.533 --> 09:29.601
on her first day, she was
sitting with all our friends,

09:29.603 --> 09:31.570
and then you came over
and interrupted her.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.338
She interrupted <i> me!</i>

09:33.340 --> 09:35.507
No, you interrupted her.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.641
You just didn't notice.

09:36.643 --> 09:39.277
And you made her feel
really left out.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.413
I didn't mean to
make her feel left out.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.582
And now she's leaving
me out on purpose.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.684
Mallet, please.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.455
Ah, but it doesn't
matter now

09:50.457 --> 09:52.691
because I'm starting
my own club--

09:52.693 --> 09:55.193
the Amber
Adventure Club!

09:55.195 --> 09:57.295
Really? Why?

09:57.297 --> 09:59.164
I'm sure you two
could patch things up

09:59.166 --> 10:00.498
if you just talk
to each other.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.467
Oh, it's too late
for that, Sofia.

10:02.469 --> 10:05.570
I already had a dozen
adventure tiaras made.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.606
See?
Oh...

10:07.608 --> 10:10.275
And my club is going to be
100 times better

10:10.277 --> 10:11.743
than Zooey's club,

10:11.745 --> 10:13.745
with its precious
little knick-knacks.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.647
I mean, what's so great
about those gold carib...

10:15.649 --> 10:17.182
whatevers?

10:17.184 --> 10:18.617
They're just oversized
paper clips.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.353
the Amber Adventure
Club tiaras are

10:21.355 --> 10:23.455
far more fabulous
than that!

10:23.457 --> 10:25.190
They are nice.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.725
Oh, I'm glad
you like them.

10:26.727 --> 10:30.195
Because you are
my first member.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.297
Oh, thanks, Amber.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.766
I guess I can be
in both clubs.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.302
But you'll like mine
better, right?

10:37.304 --> 10:39.638
( nervous chuckle )

10:41.474 --> 10:44.376
Excuse me, I have
an announcement.

10:44.378 --> 10:48.146
I am starting
the Amber Adventure Club.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.282
And anyone who joins
gets a very special

10:51.284 --> 10:53.518
adventure tiara!

10:53.520 --> 10:55.520
Ooh...
La la.

10:55.522 --> 10:56.621
Uh-oh.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.690
Sofia's already in.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.492
Where's your tiara?

11:00.494 --> 11:03.628
Oh, right here,
heh heh.

11:03.630 --> 11:04.729
I'll join
your club, Amber.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.431
♪ Fabulous ♪

11:06.433 --> 11:07.832
How 'bout
everyone else?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.434
What are you doing?

11:09.436 --> 11:11.202
Starting my own club.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.837
The Amber
Adventure Club.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.939
You're taking
all my new friends.

11:14.941 --> 11:17.642
No, I'm just trying
to get my friends

11:17.644 --> 11:19.678
to join <i> my </i> club...
hmmph.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.679
You know what?

11:20.681 --> 11:22.480
I have a great idea.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.183
Why don't you two
join your clubs together?

11:25.185 --> 11:28.253
It'll be the One Big
Happy Adventure Club.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.821
Doesn't that sound great?

11:29.823 --> 11:31.322
No!
No!

11:31.324 --> 11:32.857
If you guys want
to be in my club,

11:32.859 --> 11:34.826
you can't be
in her club too.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.594
Zooey, wait.
And today,

11:36.596 --> 11:38.463
my club is going
on the absolute

11:38.465 --> 11:39.798
best adventure yet.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.833
Oh, how great
could it possibly be

11:41.835 --> 11:44.402
if it doesn't come
with an adventure tiara?

11:44.404 --> 11:46.838
We are going
to the Diamond Tide Pools

11:46.840 --> 11:48.339
of Albini Island.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.241
Wow. Seriously?

11:50.243 --> 11:51.676
Gasp of joy.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.278
And we're going to
take my new

11:53.280 --> 11:55.447
hot-air balloon hydrofoil
to get there.

11:55.449 --> 11:58.349
It's the kind of adventure
no other club can offer.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.251
How dare you!

12:00.253 --> 12:02.487
That really does
sound fun.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.689
I've always wanted
to ride in a hydrofoil.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.691
And I've always wanted
more diamonds.

12:06.693 --> 12:09.694
What? You're all
choosing her club?

12:09.696 --> 12:11.830
Sorry, Amber--
diamonds.

12:11.832 --> 12:14.399
But we'll do
something else
with you soon.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.534
What about you,
Sofia?

12:16.536 --> 12:19.304
Sofia, we started
this club together.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.605
You were my
first member.

12:20.607 --> 12:23.508
( sighs )
Yes, I know, Zooey.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.343
But I don't want to be
part of a club

12:25.345 --> 12:26.511
that leaves out
my sister.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.680
Ah, well,
come along, Sofia.

12:28.682 --> 12:30.782
We have big adventures
to go on.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.417
I'm sorry, Zooey.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.486
( sighs )

12:34.488 --> 12:36.755
Oh, don't be disappointed,
Sofia.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.290
You and I are going
someplace even better

12:39.292 --> 12:41.593
than those rinky-dink
tide pools.
Where?

12:44.430 --> 12:46.564
We are going there.

12:46.566 --> 12:50.368
Just above Albini Island
is North Meekland,

12:50.370 --> 12:53.438
the site of the largest
meteor shower ever recorded.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.906
And meteors--
Meteorites.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.375
Meteorites are
so much better

12:57.377 --> 12:59.277
than boring old diamonds.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.712
Been there,
learned that.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.947
That does sound like
a good adventure.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.983
It will be the best.

13:04.985 --> 13:08.686
Now, all we need is
a few more members.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.655
But everyone else is
in Zooey's club.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.591
Oh, I'm sure we can find
a few princesses somewhere.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.827
( ship bell clanging )

13:19.331 --> 13:20.431
Is that everyone?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.600
Yep, I think so.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.937
So, um, Sofia didn't
change her mind or anything?

13:25.939 --> 13:28.072
Nope. Sorry.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.974
That's okay.

13:33.712 --> 13:36.514
I've still got a whole
hydrofoil full of friends.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.416
It's just what I wanted.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.351
All righty,
we're ready.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.586
MAN:
Hold on!

13:41.588 --> 13:44.355
( girls gasp, giggle )

13:44.357 --> 13:46.758
Still figuring out
these gears, Princess.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.494
I think this is
the right one.

13:52.631 --> 13:53.898
( bell clanging )

14:25.931 --> 14:27.832
You are now
official members

14:27.834 --> 14:31.903
of the one and only
Amber Adventure Club!

14:31.905 --> 14:34.472
I'm in a club!
I'm in a club!

14:34.474 --> 14:35.707
Oh...

14:35.709 --> 14:39.077
Now, your Amber
Adventure coach awaits.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.880
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy! Oh--

14:41.882 --> 14:43.748
Oh...

14:45.918 --> 14:47.518
Am I still in the club?

14:47.520 --> 14:48.820
Of course you are,
Chad.

14:48.822 --> 14:51.422
Now let's go see
those meteorites.

14:56.462 --> 14:57.896
Look, we're here.

14:57.898 --> 14:58.930
Uh, take us in, please.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.531
Aye aye, Captain Zooey.

15:13.145 --> 15:14.812
( all grunt )

15:21.954 --> 15:23.855
Diamonds,
here I come.

15:26.725 --> 15:28.893
( seagulls squawking )

15:28.895 --> 15:31.496
Zooey, are you sure
you're okay?

15:31.498 --> 15:32.730
Oh, yeah.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.532
Really excited
for this adventure.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.968
Um, it's just...

15:36.970 --> 15:39.103
I wish Sofia were here,
that's all.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.440
It would be nice if Sofia
and Amber were here.

15:42.442 --> 15:46.010
Why does everyone want Amber
to be here so badly?

15:50.983 --> 15:52.951
( gasps )

15:52.953 --> 15:54.953
( Zooey shrieks )

15:54.955 --> 15:56.154
Uh-oh!

15:56.156 --> 15:57.889
( bell clanging )

15:57.891 --> 15:59.924
Grab on!

15:59.926 --> 16:01.492
( all straining )

16:05.798 --> 16:07.498
We're just not
strong enough!

16:08.233 --> 16:09.567
What are we gonna do?

16:09.569 --> 16:11.135
What are we gonna <i> do?</i>

16:11.137 --> 16:13.538
Whoa!
Oh, no!

16:13.540 --> 16:15.974
Aah...

16:20.612 --> 16:23.514
Don't panic.
We can still catch it.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.250
ZOOEY:
Ugh, it won't reach.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.885
The hydrofoil is too high.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.187
Oh...

16:32.758 --> 16:33.825
Now what?

16:33.827 --> 16:35.159
I'll go look for help.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.194
Maybe there's a village

16:36.196 --> 16:37.662
on the far side of the island.

16:39.598 --> 16:42.166
I'm so sorry.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.801
But at least it's
a real adventure now.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.703
( nervous laugh )

16:48.507 --> 16:50.241
What's that?
What?

16:50.243 --> 16:52.710
SOFIA:
It's coming our way.

16:52.712 --> 16:53.811
AMBER:
What is it?

16:53.813 --> 16:55.380
It's Zooey's balloon.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.651
SOFIA:
But they're not in it.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.753
Where are they?

17:01.755 --> 17:03.121
Is that them
on the island?

17:04.123 --> 17:05.757
SOFIA:
Wait, it is them.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.191
We have to help them.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.160
Do we really?

17:09.162 --> 17:10.528
Amber, Zooey's
in trouble,

17:10.530 --> 17:12.163
and so are the others.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.831
Maybe you can be
the bigger princess here

17:13.833 --> 17:14.932
and help her, even though

17:14.934 --> 17:16.200
you two aren't
getting along.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.836
Oh... all right,
I'll help.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.171
Thank you.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.672
Coachman, please
take us

17:21.674 --> 17:22.874
to Albini Island.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.043
Yes, milady.
Hyah!

17:25.045 --> 17:26.978
( horses neighing )

17:32.718 --> 17:33.918
HILDEGARD:
We're never going to get home.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.153
We're never going to get home.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.888
We're never going
to get home!

17:36.890 --> 17:37.955
( horses neighing )
Look!

17:37.957 --> 17:39.757
It's Sofia and Amber!

17:39.759 --> 17:41.793
What?
They're flying
right toward us.

17:41.795 --> 17:44.328
Oh, thank goodness!
We're saved.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.667
( all shouting )

17:49.669 --> 17:51.702
SOFIA:
Run for cover!

17:59.144 --> 18:01.045
Sofia!
Amber!

18:01.047 --> 18:03.114
We are so happy
to see you.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.982
What are you doing
all the way out here?

18:04.984 --> 18:06.784
Ugh, don't worry,

18:06.786 --> 18:09.087
I'm not trying to
get into your club.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.756
We saw your balloon
and thought you might
need some help.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.990
Oh, thank you.

18:12.992 --> 18:15.726
But can we all fit
in your coach?

18:15.728 --> 18:16.928
I'm afraid not.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.063
Five is the maximum
royal occupancy.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.798
An no one will be
riding in it

18:20.800 --> 18:22.667
unless I can fix
this wheel.

18:22.669 --> 18:26.137
Hmm, does anyone have
a screwdriver?

18:26.139 --> 18:27.872
Oh... thanks.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.741
Zooey, if I bring you
up to your balloon,

18:30.743 --> 18:32.677
can you fly it
back here?

18:32.679 --> 18:34.011
I think so,
but...

18:34.013 --> 18:35.813
how can you
get me out there?

18:35.815 --> 18:37.748
I'll fly you over
on one of the horses.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.051
Then you could
lower me down
to the balloon.

18:40.053 --> 18:42.753
But I don't think you can
do it on your own.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.188
Then I'll go too.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.257
You?
You'll help me?

18:46.259 --> 18:48.759
Yes, it looks like
I will.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.828
Thank you.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.164
I--I don't know what
I would've done without you.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.166
Both of you.

18:58.904 --> 19:00.905
Hyah!
AMBER:
Hyah!

19:05.777 --> 19:08.713
( horses neighing )

19:08.715 --> 19:10.681
Good luck!
You can do it.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.183
There's no way
they can do it.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.851
ZOOEY:
Over there, I see it.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.052
SOFIA:
We have to catch it before

19:15.054 --> 19:16.687
it disappears
into those clouds.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.956
We need to go faster.
It's getting away!

19:18.958 --> 19:19.991
Hyah!
Hyah!

19:19.993 --> 19:21.726
Fly with the trade wind.

19:21.728 --> 19:24.061
It'll give us a boost.
Great.

19:24.063 --> 19:26.931
ZOOEY:
Be alert. These winds can
shift in an instant.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.099
SOFIA:
Don't worry,
we've got you.

19:28.101 --> 19:30.902
I know,
I just need to fit...

19:30.904 --> 19:32.837
There.

19:34.706 --> 19:36.774
Fly steady,
I'm going down.

19:36.776 --> 19:37.942
Be careful.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.777
Always.

19:48.153 --> 19:49.820
( straining )

19:51.890 --> 19:53.858
I'm on.
Aah!

19:54.826 --> 19:56.794
Hang on!

19:56.796 --> 19:58.996
I've got you.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.469
Are you okay?

20:05.471 --> 20:06.904
Yeah, I think so.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.873
AMBER:
Oh, Zooey, be careful.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.042
I will.
Thanks, Amber.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.081
I'm onboard.

20:18.183 --> 20:21.219
Thanks.
You can let go.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.788
( sighs )
That oversized paper clip

20:23.790 --> 20:24.789
sure comes in handy.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.833
( ship bell clanging )

20:37.736 --> 20:38.970
Oh... we're doomed.

20:38.972 --> 20:42.440
( horses neighing )
They're coming back!

20:42.442 --> 20:44.842
They did it?
I knew it all along.

20:59.391 --> 21:02.126
Good news, I found enough wood
to make a raft.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.394
Wheel's all fixed.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.862
I've saved the day.

21:04.864 --> 21:08.099
Yeah!

21:08.101 --> 21:10.968
All right, who's ready
to se those tide pools?

21:10.970 --> 21:12.803
I am.
Count me in.

21:12.805 --> 21:13.838
It's about time.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.942
Amber...

21:17.944 --> 21:20.344
I'm sorry I didn't
let you into my club.

21:20.346 --> 21:23.180
I--I was just afraid
that if you were around,

21:23.182 --> 21:24.949
no one would pay
attention to me.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.285
Oh, I understand.

21:27.287 --> 21:28.953
And I'm sorry
if I was rude.

21:28.955 --> 21:32.189
You were...
Then I'm sorry.

21:32.191 --> 21:33.791
That's okay.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.026
So, would you like to be

21:35.028 --> 21:38.796
in the Princess
Adventure Club?

21:38.798 --> 21:40.798
It's a fan, see?

21:40.800 --> 21:44.001
Oh, well, this is
a handy little knick-knack.

21:44.003 --> 21:44.935
Welcome to the club.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.471
Actually, I have
a better idea.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.874
Why don't we join
our clubs together?

21:49.876 --> 21:51.309
I'd love that.

21:51.311 --> 21:54.278
We'll be one big
happy Adventure Club.

21:54.280 --> 21:57.014
HILDEGARD:
Diamonds! Everywhere!

21:57.016 --> 21:58.382
And they're all for me!

21:58.384 --> 22:00.551
Uh-uh, Clio,
that one's mine.

22:00.553 --> 22:01.919
CLIO:
Hildy!
