00:48.713 --> 00:51.283

05:18.516 --> 05:21.687
Well, think about it Jack.

05:21.720 --> 05:23.389
With the baby-

05:23.422 --> 05:24.423
Yeah, I know-

05:24.456 --> 05:25.858
I love Pike, it's just that he-

05:25.891 --> 05:28.061
I know you do.

05:31.430 --> 05:33.365
Did he at least lock the door?

05:33.399 --> 05:35.567
Yeah.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.803
Really?

05:39.605 --> 05:41.908

05:44.410 --> 05:47.847

gonna be taking some time off.

05:47.879 --> 05:48.980
A month or so.

05:49.014 --> 05:51.484
Susan will give you the details.

05:55.153 --> 05:57.656
Thanks Doc, I'll work on it.

06:23.048 --> 06:25.151
Eggs are ready.

06:25.584 --> 06:27.786
You didn't have to do that.

06:29.721 --> 06:31.958
It's fine.

06:46.004 --> 06:47.974
Ya gonna miss
being a teacher?

06:50.608 --> 06:54.479
Miss my kids,
but I'll have my hands full.

06:54.512 --> 06:58.450
What's uh, what's
Jack thinking about it?

07:00.252 --> 07:02.487
I don't really know Pike...

07:02.521 --> 07:04.757
He doesn't really talk about it.

07:04.790 --> 07:08.828
Well, sure glad you
guys decided to keep it.

07:10.562 --> 07:12.432
What?

07:18.136 --> 07:21.807
Hey Jack,

07:21.839 --> 07:24.476
What ya doing
with your time off?

07:24.509 --> 07:26.812
Just gonna relax.

07:26.845 --> 07:28.914
Hey uh, next week I

07:28.947 --> 07:30.649

07:31.250 --> 07:34.153
Sure, anytime.
Give me a call.

09:52.356 --> 09:55.860
Okay parents to be.
We're about to get started.

09:55.894 --> 09:58.230
But first, welcome.

09:58.263 --> 10:02.268
You all are about to
embark on a beautiful journey.

10:02.967 --> 10:05.303
Don't worry,
I know you're scared to the max.

10:05.803 --> 10:08.406
Now there's a part of me
that believes that there's

10:08.440 --> 10:10.342
nothing that
I can say to you really

10:10.375 --> 10:13.678
that can prepare
you for this experience.

10:13.711 --> 10:17.850
But what's important
is that you are all here.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.719
Together.

10:20.751 --> 10:24.088
And you will be able to face the
challenges as they come.

10:24.121 --> 10:28.026
We are here, in the center
of this gym, in this circle,

10:28.059 --> 10:29.827
this circle together.

10:29.860 --> 10:31.864
This circle is your life.

10:33.465 --> 10:35.901
I'm sorry.

10:58.255 --> 10:59.991
What are
you doing here?

11:05.330 --> 11:07.800
You know
how embarrassed I was?

11:09.134 --> 11:11.137
What are you talking about?

11:11.570 --> 11:15.007
Just sitting there.

11:15.039 --> 11:18.076
The
only one without her husband.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.680
Oh, fuck.

11:23.914 --> 11:25.783
Where were you?

11:25.817 --> 11:29.788
I took a run. I just forgot.

11:30.522 --> 11:32.425
How long?

11:33.158 --> 11:34.927
How long what?

11:34.960 --> 11:37.495
I saw Susan at
the store the other day.

11:37.528 --> 11:39.465
Thought it was
strange you were at work.

11:39.498 --> 11:41.500
Of course I
made an excuse for you.

11:41.533 --> 11:44.103
I'm sorry.

11:44.135 --> 11:46.971
Sit down Jack!

11:47.004 --> 11:48.774
Fine.

11:52.943 --> 11:55.880
Talk to me.

11:56.847 --> 11:59.150
Isn't that what people do here?

12:02.988 --> 12:05.491
I stopped seeing
patients about a week ago.

12:05.524 --> 12:07.493
And I'm sorry
I didn't tell ya.

12:07.525 --> 12:09.861
I'm still
doing work I'm just...

12:10.796 --> 12:13.198
I'm trying to get my
mind right with everything.

12:13.230 --> 12:14.799
With the baby?

12:14.832 --> 12:17.802
Yeah. I just want
everything to be ready.

12:17.836 --> 12:19.805
I gotta
be ready ya know?

12:19.837 --> 12:22.373
Jack being ready is
showing up to that meeting.

12:22.407 --> 12:26.912
It's about
being honest, talking to me.

12:26.945 --> 12:28.748
Yeah.

12:29.014 --> 12:30.483
Jack you're not...

12:32.216 --> 12:33.918
you're not here.

12:33.951 --> 12:36.187
You haven't
been here for awhile now.

12:36.620 --> 12:40.793
I gave
up everything.

12:40.826 --> 12:44.396
I gave up teaching.
I'm home now.

12:44.428 --> 12:46.063
I get that.

12:46.096 --> 12:47.533
And I wanna know why.

12:51.235 --> 12:53.105
Okay uh-

12:53.138 --> 12:54.273
I wanna know why!

12:54.306 --> 12:56.375
Everyday
I see the same people make the

12:56.408 --> 12:59.245
same mistakes
over and over again and,

13:02.013 --> 13:03.447
I can't fix them,

13:03.480 --> 13:06.152
I understand
people, but I can't fix them.

13:07.952 --> 13:09.988
Look at Pike
my own fuckin' brother.

13:11.889 --> 13:13.491
It's
not your job to fix people.

13:13.524 --> 13:15.193
Then what is my job Stace?

13:15.226 --> 13:17.095
I mean really
who am I without that-

13:17.128 --> 13:18.197
My husband.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.199
I know and I appreciate that.

13:20.231 --> 13:23.001
But right now it's
not good enough for me.

13:23.902 --> 13:25.204
Okay-

13:25.236 --> 13:26.237
Who will our son see?

13:26.270 --> 13:28.873
Just his dad
that's all he needs.

13:35.046 --> 13:36.615
This is not okay.

13:36.648 --> 13:37.983
Figure it out.

14:11.515 --> 14:15.254
Stacey.
I'm sorry for leaving like this...

14:25.363 --> 14:28.400
Something happened...

14:33.104 --> 14:36.475
Pike could be
in serious trouble.

14:36.508 --> 14:40.112
I hope you can understand...

14:52.990 --> 14:55.126
Jack?

14:55.159 --> 14:56.594
Stay calm, Pike.

15:01.332 --> 15:03.367
Pike! Stop or
you're gonna tip the boat!

15:03.400 --> 15:06.003
Jack! What are
you doing man!?

15:06.037 --> 15:07.105
Stop!

15:11.509 --> 15:14.278
I can't swim Jack! Jack?

15:14.312 --> 15:17.282
You motherfucker! Come back!

15:17.315 --> 15:18.617
Don't go!

15:19.216 --> 15:21.153
I'll see you at
the end of all this.

15:21.186 --> 15:23.322
Maybe it'll
make more sense then.

15:46.677 --> 15:48.312
You ain't gonna shoot me!

15:48.346 --> 15:49.981
I'll shoot your leg, man!

15:50.782 --> 15:53.585
Fuck you!

15:53.618 --> 15:56.188

15:59.557 --> 16:02.427

16:05.129 --> 16:06.966

16:07.599 --> 16:10.002

16:10.034 --> 16:11.403
Man stop doing this to me.

16:11.436 --> 16:13.038
Try to remember something.

16:17.142 --> 16:20.245
I'm spinning.

16:35.759 --> 16:37.629
You remember Butch Miller?

16:38.163 --> 16:39.163
No.

16:39.197 --> 16:40.466
The cop.

16:41.131 --> 16:42.332
No.

16:42.366 --> 16:44.635
He was at your wedding Pike,
there was like 15 people there!

16:44.668 --> 16:45.770
Okay!

16:45.803 --> 16:46.971
Yeah well,

16:47.004 --> 16:49.274
Butch called me last night said
they were looking for ya.

16:51.308 --> 16:52.443
Fuck the cops man!

16:52.476 --> 16:54.045
You must
have done something.

16:54.078 --> 16:56.314
Man I
don't know I blacked!

16:56.847 --> 16:58.716
You sober now?

17:05.089 --> 17:06.824
Here's some dry clothes.

17:06.857 --> 17:09.727
Try to remember
something. I'll set up.

17:40.692 --> 17:43.161
I'm fucking cold, Jack!

17:43.193 --> 17:45.329
It's fucking cold out here!

17:45.363 --> 17:47.166
Fuck!

17:50.734 --> 17:52.236
Did you get my jacket?

17:52.269 --> 17:53.738
What jacket?

17:53.770 --> 17:56.841
Man the one I
always wear! Fuck!

17:58.843 --> 18:01.080
Get a
fire going if you're cold.

18:12.390 --> 18:16.394
Man why you
fucking with that shit now?

18:16.426 --> 18:18.163
You ain't hungry?

18:18.195 --> 18:20.098
Don't have any food.

18:21.932 --> 18:24.836
You got a tent? But no beans?

18:25.737 --> 18:28.740
Grocery store wasn't open.

18:31.643 --> 18:34.379
Don't get me wrong Jack.

18:34.412 --> 18:35.913
I appreciate you
looking out for me.

18:35.946 --> 18:40.251
Fuck man ,
People gotta eat!

18:55.299 --> 18:57.435
Man you ain't shooting shit!

20:08.740 --> 20:11.543
Squirrel!

20:12.242 --> 20:16.714
Oh my god. It's
delicious if I'm being honest.

20:17.448 --> 20:19.785
It ain't bad.

20:22.787 --> 20:25.223
I didn't know
you were shooting again.

20:28.058 --> 20:29.994
Yeah...

20:30.028 --> 20:32.396
Thought I'd
teach the boy one day.

20:34.832 --> 20:36.835
You guys got a name?

20:36.867 --> 20:38.803
No.

20:42.406 --> 20:44.542
Why were you asking
about your jacket earlier?

20:49.047 --> 20:50.949
Cause I was cold.

20:50.981 --> 20:52.317
No you weren't.

20:54.786 --> 20:56.755
You think the cops
could get in my place?

20:56.788 --> 20:58.457
Yeah...

21:00.057 --> 21:02.059
Yeah, I mean especially
if they got a warrant.

21:02.093 --> 21:04.028
Well shit.

21:04.061 --> 21:05.997
What are you saying?

21:07.898 --> 21:09.433
It's just that-

21:10.300 --> 21:13.337
it's just a little
shit is in my jacket is all.

21:13.371 --> 21:15.340
That's why
I need my jacket!

21:17.008 --> 21:18.375
I mean, I'm
trying to quit.

21:18.409 --> 21:19.978
It's just, it's not a lot-

21:20.010 --> 21:22.880
it's just, they could lock
me up for it if they find it.

21:24.615 --> 21:26.684
Yeah man I found it.

21:32.390 --> 21:35.027
Give it to me.

21:36.094 --> 21:38.730
I flushed it.

21:49.807 --> 21:52.076
That's good thinking.

21:53.144 --> 21:56.414
Yeah, that's good thinking.

22:27.678 --> 22:30.648
Ma used to listen
to music just like that.

22:30.681 --> 22:32.918
I like it.

22:33.585 --> 22:36.855
Makes me
wanna slow dance.

22:42.492 --> 22:44.162
Here's your
news at the top of the hour.

22:44.194 --> 22:46.730
State Police are searching for
a local man they believe was

22:46.763 --> 22:49.933
responsible for an altercation
that lead to a fight at a local

22:49.967 --> 22:52.704
bar that left one man
dead and another injured.

22:52.737 --> 22:54.538
Police are not
yet releasing the name of the

22:54.571 --> 22:58.142
victim but they say the suspect
is 43 year old Phillip Ables,

22:58.175 --> 22:59.877
who goes by the name of Pike.

22:59.911 --> 23:03.047
If you have any information on
his whereabouts you are urged to

23:03.079 --> 23:06.150
contact your
local police or dial 911.

23:06.617 --> 23:08.852
We will keep you
posted as the news comes in.

23:08.885 --> 23:11.423
Now, back
to the classics at ten.

23:14.224 --> 23:16.894
Pike.

23:17.862 --> 23:20.499
I don't remember.

23:27.672 --> 23:29.073
Pike.

23:29.105 --> 23:30.741
I don't remember.

23:31.509 --> 23:33.644
Pike.

23:42.487 --> 23:44.656
I don't remember.

24:08.144 --> 24:10.581
Looks like you cut it.

24:14.684 --> 24:16.520
You bandaged me up?

24:16.554 --> 24:18.223
Yeah.

24:24.996 --> 24:28.200
This isn't your problem
Jack you should go home.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.135
No.

24:32.169 --> 24:34.105
Why?

24:36.641 --> 24:39.076
Cause I don't
think you're a murderer.

24:43.314 --> 24:45.650
I mean they're saying I did it.

24:46.150 --> 24:48.086
Looks like I did it.

24:48.685 --> 24:50.654
Yeah.

24:57.127 --> 24:58.996
I gotta go the bathroom.

25:57.288 --> 25:58.256
Jack!

25:58.288 --> 25:59.656
What?

25:59.690 --> 26:01.326
Somebody's
coming. We gotta go man!

26:01.358 --> 26:02.759
You sure?

26:02.792 --> 26:04.061
Yeah

26:04.095 --> 26:05.797
Well let's-
we need the-

26:05.829 --> 26:07.331
Fuck the tent! Let's go!

26:21.345 --> 26:24.848
They say the suspect
is 43 year-old Phillip Ables.

26:24.882 --> 26:26.851
It's your fucking fault.

26:29.252 --> 26:30.887
Jack.

26:30.921 --> 26:32.957
Follow me.

26:38.996 --> 26:41.166
Jack.

27:10.994 --> 27:11.962
Shit!

27:11.996 --> 27:16.234
Seriously? You missing
on purpose! I gotta eat.

27:16.267 --> 27:18.135
I gotta find that arrow.

27:18.169 --> 27:20.305
You should have
brought my jacket fuck!

27:22.239 --> 27:24.142
I feel like I'm dying Jack.

27:24.174 --> 27:26.010
Then start praying Pike.

27:26.611 --> 27:28.713
I'm doing everything I can.

27:46.830 --> 27:49.967
Doesn't look like anyone's home.

27:52.903 --> 27:54.337
That'd be a miracle.

27:54.371 --> 27:56.941
Stay here. I'll turn
a light on if we can get in.

29:15.051 --> 29:17.321
Are you shitting me?

29:25.229 --> 29:30.168
Oh, thank you God.

29:31.568 --> 29:34.571
Hey! Hey!

29:34.605 --> 29:36.441
It's like Thanksgiving.

29:38.008 --> 29:40.044
Find a can opener!

29:46.217 --> 29:47.986
Stove works.

29:48.986 --> 29:51.222
Can opener.

29:54.858 --> 29:57.828
Are you kidding me?

30:02.333 --> 30:04.469
It's my brand!

30:30.527 --> 30:33.298
Lord, thank you for the food.

30:35.365 --> 30:37.902
Thank you for
helping us finding the food.

30:38.935 --> 30:41.872
And thank you for giving
me my little brother Jack...

30:46.309 --> 30:48.479
About now
he's the only thing I got.

30:51.248 --> 30:53.451
And I know he's
going to be a good dad,

30:54.151 --> 30:57.388
even through Stacey says
he's scared like a little bitch.

30:57.421 --> 30:58.355
She said that?

30:58.388 --> 31:00.257
Man I thought
you said this was personal?

31:04.028 --> 31:07.065
Sorry for the
interruption man.

31:10.467 --> 31:14.038
But you know,

31:14.070 --> 31:16.440
or at
least I hope you know.

31:21.644 --> 31:25.884
That I...

31:27.417 --> 31:30.221
really never
wanted to hurt anybody.

31:34.692 --> 31:37.028
Maybe I'm cursed?

31:37.661 --> 31:40.331
Some people
just are I guess.

31:44.101 --> 31:46.671
But I really
do want to be better.

31:50.441 --> 31:53.478
So, amen.

33:17.161 --> 33:21.432
Shh. It's a cop.

33:45.689 --> 33:48.526
I'm scared Jack.

33:48.558 --> 33:50.394
Get inside.

33:59.635 --> 34:01.505
I need your eyes.

34:03.406 --> 34:05.576
So we're here.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.211
The closest place
you're safe is here.

34:07.243 --> 34:08.511
Canada?

34:08.545 --> 34:10.313
Cops don't have
jurisdiction there.

34:11.648 --> 34:13.583
Man what the
hell am I gonna do in Canada?

34:13.617 --> 34:15.518
Man what are
you gonna do in jail!?

34:16.786 --> 34:17.754
There's
gotta be something else-

34:17.788 --> 34:21.358
Then tell me! If you got
something let's hear it!

34:23.159 --> 34:26.431
I know it sounds crazy, I just
don't know what else to do.

34:30.199 --> 34:31.634
They speak English there?

34:31.668 --> 34:34.637
For the most part yeah.
Above Michigan for sure.

34:34.670 --> 34:36.540
It's not that much
different than here.

34:39.342 --> 34:42.312
What am I gonna do?

34:42.346 --> 34:44.414
Whatever you want.

34:46.483 --> 34:48.585
Nobody will know
ya. It's a new start.

34:54.391 --> 34:56.626
How far is it?

35:01.197 --> 35:04.234
So we're here.

35:04.268 --> 35:06.570
It's about 70 miles until
we can get into Michigan.

35:06.603 --> 35:08.305
Once
we cross state line we might be

35:08.338 --> 35:09.473
able to figure
something else out.

35:09.505 --> 35:11.574
But, until then
we gotta hike it.

35:11.608 --> 35:13.777
It's too risky.

35:13.809 --> 35:15.913
We can
take some cans and what not,

35:15.945 --> 35:17.648
but we don't have a tent.

35:18.481 --> 35:20.617
It ain't gonna be easy.

35:22.219 --> 35:24.554
What do you say?

35:35.331 --> 35:38.802
You got the
fight in you or not?

35:53.317 --> 35:54.851
Thank you.

35:54.885 --> 35:56.621
Pack those cans.

36:24.514 --> 36:26.916
Oh come on
man. We can go around.

36:26.949 --> 36:28.919
We can swim across it.

36:33.956 --> 36:35.259
Grab a rope. Grab a rope.

36:38.494 --> 36:40.230
You alright?

36:40.264 --> 36:41.566
Yeah, come on.

36:54.878 --> 36:56.713
Fuck!

38:01.478 --> 38:03.614
Hunter.

40:11.208 --> 40:14.043
You remember
how to hot wire a car?

40:14.878 --> 40:16.847
Who says I know how to?

40:16.880 --> 40:18.449
I know that was you.

40:19.916 --> 40:21.051
Well I
ain't stealing that one.

40:21.083 --> 40:23.019
I ain't
sleeping outside tonight.

40:31.862 --> 40:34.764
Hey, I found that
extension we were looking for.

40:34.797 --> 40:37.099
Man you gotta
start putting my tools back.

40:37.132 --> 40:38.234
What where was it?

40:38.268 --> 40:39.503
Toolbox around the corner.

40:39.536 --> 40:42.706
Spent half as much time looking
for tools we'd be done already.

40:42.739 --> 40:44.474
I don't think
that's the problem.

40:44.507 --> 40:46.042
Try that one.

40:46.076 --> 40:47.878
Let's see it.

41:05.762 --> 41:06.563
You hear that?

41:06.596 --> 41:08.731
Man,
it's probably a coon. Come on.

41:08.764 --> 41:10.667
Let's finish this.

41:15.871 --> 41:20.576
Man it's probably a
coon, let's do this. Come on.

41:20.610 --> 41:21.945
Get back here.

41:21.978 --> 41:23.947
Yeah
alright, you're probably right.

41:23.980 --> 41:26.115
Come on man.

41:28.952 --> 41:30.254
You get that tight?

41:32.289 --> 41:34.158
Sooner we get this done,
sooner we're having beers.

41:36.659 --> 41:38.061
Let's go.

41:46.635 --> 41:49.706
Go.

41:50.673 --> 41:52.543
Knife.

42:02.952 --> 42:04.121
Go! Go! Go!

42:04.153 --> 42:06.257
They're stealing
a car! Let's get them!

42:09.592 --> 42:11.295
Go go go

42:11.327 --> 42:13.130
- I'm going!

42:13.163 --> 42:14.898
- I'm going!
- Floor it! Come on! Let's go!

42:14.931 --> 42:15.831
I'm going!

42:15.865 --> 42:17.266
Oh shit man

42:17.300 --> 42:18.969
Oh man we
gotta go! Floor it, Jack!

42:19.001 --> 42:20.269
- Come on!
- I am flooring it man! You stole

42:20.302 --> 42:22.105
a fucking car
from a junk yard man!

42:22.137 --> 42:23.005
Hey! Where you going?

42:23.039 --> 42:24.841
I'm just going
through fucking dirt man!

42:24.873 --> 42:26.175
- Find a road!
- I'm trying, man!

42:26.208 --> 42:28.210
Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! We gotta go man!

42:28.244 --> 42:29.880
I am riding the
fucking lightening Pike!

42:29.913 --> 42:31.181
I am riding the lightening!

42:32.349 --> 42:35.052
I think we lost them.

42:35.085 --> 42:36.653
Yeah?

42:36.686 --> 42:38.288
Oh shit that was close.

42:41.157 --> 42:45.295
Woo! Man, I knew you could hot

42:45.327 --> 42:48.097
wire that car. I knew
you could hot wire that car-

42:48.130 --> 42:49.098
Jack!

43:01.378 --> 43:03.146
Holy shit.

43:06.949 --> 43:09.085
Jack?

43:10.786 --> 43:12.288
Jack?

43:13.822 --> 43:15.192
Jackie?

43:17.693 --> 43:18.962
Jack?

43:23.365 --> 43:24.967
You okay buddy?

43:25.001 --> 43:27.805
Ride the lightening.

43:28.271 --> 43:30.206
We'll get you outta here okay?

43:30.239 --> 43:32.175
Stay right there.

43:39.014 --> 43:41.417
I got you buddy.
Come on. Come on.

43:41.451 --> 43:42.985
We gotta get out come on.

43:43.018 --> 43:45.855
Let's go!
Jack come on we gotta go!

43:45.889 --> 43:50.628
Come on buddy!
We gotta go! Jack come on!

44:06.809 --> 44:08.177
Fuck.

44:11.847 --> 44:14.183
I don't
know what to do.

44:15.818 --> 44:18.021
I have an idea.

44:31.900 --> 44:34.403
I'm over here fat asses.

44:34.436 --> 44:36.706
Let's go motherfucker. Let's go!

44:37.106 --> 44:38.875
Don't you

44:38.907 --> 44:40.409
Don't you
make me fucking do it!

44:40.443 --> 44:42.211
Don't
you make me fucking do it!

44:42.244 --> 44:43.746
The fuck is going on?

44:43.780 --> 44:44.915
You
just want it one at a time?

44:44.947 --> 44:46.248
Or you both wanna do it at once?

44:46.282 --> 44:48.117
- Come on!
- Billy, back up.

44:48.150 --> 44:49.351
This mother fucker is crazy.

44:49.385 --> 44:51.121
Oh man!
Come on man! Oh man!

44:51.153 --> 44:54.925
Calm the fuck down!

44:56.760 --> 44:58.128
One question!

44:58.628 --> 45:00.798
You both like
getting taken from behind?

45:02.865 --> 45:04.168
Hey boys.

45:05.068 --> 45:07.738
Get in the truck Pike.

45:13.409 --> 45:16.747
Ow! Ow! Yeah!

45:16.780 --> 45:19.282
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

45:19.315 --> 45:21.184
Ow wow wow wow! Yes!

45:21.217 --> 45:23.153
Holy shit that
was awesome man!

45:23.186 --> 45:24.254
That was all you, brother.

45:24.286 --> 45:26.455
Man being crazy is way
more scarier when you're sober.

45:26.489 --> 45:27.456
Mmhm.

45:27.489 --> 45:30.093
Oh my God.

45:30.927 --> 45:32.496
This truck is bitchin'.

45:32.528 --> 45:34.231
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

45:34.264 --> 45:37.000
Oh my God! I feel alive.

45:58.487 --> 46:01.223
Police are still
looking for Phillip Pike Ables who was a

46:01.257 --> 46:03.193
suspect in a
bar fight turned deadly.

46:03.226 --> 46:05.862
Authorities said they
received a search warrant for

46:05.894 --> 46:07.163
his property on Monday morning.

46:07.197 --> 46:09.032
Officer Miller
stated that the residence

46:09.065 --> 46:10.133
was empty at the time.

46:10.166 --> 46:12.369
But described
the scene as a squalor.

46:12.402 --> 46:14.971
Local authorities have
widened the search through more

46:15.003 --> 46:17.273
parts of Northern Indiana
and into lower Michigan.

46:34.858 --> 46:37.827
Where are we?

46:37.860 --> 46:41.197
Motel for the
night. Put this on.

46:41.998 --> 46:43.800
Put it on.

46:45.869 --> 46:47.037
Found a room unlocked.

46:47.070 --> 46:48.838
Nobody will be by until morning.

46:48.871 --> 46:49.940
Really? You sure?

46:49.972 --> 46:51.175
Just act normal.

47:12.628 --> 47:15.197
Oh you
gotta try this, Jack.

47:15.231 --> 47:16.466
I will.

47:16.498 --> 47:18.467
So good.

47:20.536 --> 47:22.371
I gotta ditch this truck.

47:22.405 --> 47:26.476
You can
stay here, relax, shower...

47:26.509 --> 47:29.512
But don't leave this room.

47:30.612 --> 47:32.581
And
don't take those bandages off.

47:32.614 --> 47:34.350
I'm gonna try
to get some supplies,

47:34.384 --> 47:35.418
I'll look for
some new ones,

47:35.451 --> 47:37.086
but I don't
know what will be open.

47:37.119 --> 47:39.455
We needed this, man.

47:42.625 --> 47:45.327
Be safe, man.

47:45.360 --> 47:49.632
I'm gonna lock this. You're
gonna have to let me back in.

47:49.666 --> 47:52.169
Stay here and
take a fucking shower.

47:55.704 --> 47:57.940
I don't need
a fucking shower...

47:59.074 --> 48:01.110
I need a fucking shower.

48:58.668 --> 49:01.204
Oh, oh my gosh.
I am so sorry, I didn't know

49:01.237 --> 49:02.605
anybody was in this room.

49:02.637 --> 49:06.009
Mind if I finish?
It won't take long.

49:08.010 --> 49:11.047
Okay.

49:18.054 --> 49:21.490
So uh, you
traveling for business?

49:21.523 --> 49:22.992
Uh-huh.

49:23.760 --> 49:25.429
What do you do?

49:30.333 --> 49:32.635
I'm a business man.

49:34.536 --> 49:37.506
I'm Sammy.

49:37.539 --> 49:40.043
What's your name doll?

49:42.677 --> 49:45.348
Jack.

49:45.815 --> 49:48.351
Well, nice to meet you Jack.

50:11.641 --> 50:14.778
I'm married.

50:18.815 --> 50:20.751
Is she at home?

50:25.454 --> 50:28.592
She passed
away a few years ago.

50:30.793 --> 50:33.563
I'm sorry doll.

50:33.596 --> 50:35.465
How'd she go?

50:59.621 --> 51:02.224
I was gonna
invite you to my room.

51:04.126 --> 51:08.597
I got at
least a dime of boss.

51:25.748 --> 51:29.184
Yeah?

51:29.217 --> 51:32.288
God I want to.

51:35.757 --> 51:38.761
But I shouldn't.

51:41.597 --> 51:43.600
It wouldn't be right.

51:46.335 --> 51:50.539
When we first met. She
just dabbled with the stuff.

51:50.572 --> 51:52.708
But I liked her.

51:54.277 --> 51:56.545
And I got it for her.

51:56.579 --> 51:58.681
I should go.

51:58.713 --> 52:00.516
So yeah...

52:03.286 --> 52:05.188
it's my fucking fault.

52:16.199 --> 52:17.701
Goodnight Jack.

53:42.918 --> 53:44.521
You alright?

53:45.454 --> 53:47.557
I'm good man.

54:24.559 --> 54:26.061
- Jack.
- Hm?

54:26.094 --> 54:28.764
Nothing, just
making sure you're awake.

54:30.766 --> 54:32.568
That's not cool.

54:40.775 --> 54:42.945
Jack you'll tell
your son about me right?

54:47.882 --> 54:49.551
I mean...

54:49.585 --> 54:51.320
the good stuff.

54:56.726 --> 54:59.429
Yeah, I'll tell him.

55:00.795 --> 55:02.765
I got some good I think.

55:32.994 --> 55:34.864
Shit!

55:35.731 --> 55:40.537
The map! It's gone!

55:42.972 --> 55:44.073
You still know
where you're going right?

55:44.106 --> 55:47.543
Yeah Pike! Let's just
follow the North fucking star!

55:48.443 --> 55:49.811
Just asking.

55:49.844 --> 55:51.714
Fuck!

55:59.487 --> 56:01.790
Fuck!

56:13.101 --> 56:14.103
It's gonna
sound a little nutty.

56:14.137 --> 56:16.873
But I think I might
kind of know where we are.

56:16.905 --> 56:18.074
Really?

56:18.106 --> 56:20.110
Yeah.

56:20.643 --> 56:23.612
When I was a kid I
used to run away from the house.

56:24.112 --> 56:26.715
And I found my way back by
following this creek that seemed

56:26.748 --> 56:27.949
like it went forever.

56:27.983 --> 56:29.753
Pike
you saying you know this creek?

56:34.556 --> 56:36.558
Maybe...

56:37.226 --> 56:39.528
I mean a creeks a creek but...

56:40.161 --> 56:42.697
Our house is in
Southern Michigan,

56:42.731 --> 56:44.934
we're in
Southern Michigan now right?

56:44.967 --> 56:46.802
Yeah.

56:55.510 --> 56:59.449
Well fuck it then, follow me.

57:39.554 --> 57:41.590
Holy shit.

57:46.929 --> 57:49.831
Looks abandoned.

57:49.864 --> 57:52.134
Good.

57:54.036 --> 57:55.972
Where you going?

57:56.005 --> 57:59.008
Look man there's a store
about 3 miles up the road.

57:59.041 --> 58:01.077
You can get a map there.

58:01.610 --> 58:04.881
It's too risky
and I'm too tired.

58:05.414 --> 58:07.083
Let's just park it here tonight.

58:09.217 --> 58:12.120
Shits haunted man.

58:39.882 --> 58:42.018
You really
don't remember this place?

58:43.318 --> 58:45.121
Not really.

58:52.860 --> 58:54.263
You were young.

59:05.641 --> 59:08.677
Home sweet home.

59:08.710 --> 59:10.612
Brings it back, yeah?

59:10.646 --> 59:12.615
Oh yeah.

59:12.648 --> 59:15.952
You took
your first steps right there.

59:16.885 --> 59:18.821
How long were we here for again?

59:19.722 --> 59:22.325
You? About 4 years.

59:24.626 --> 59:27.262
Right up to a
month after dad left.

59:27.295 --> 59:29.030
And what was that story?

59:29.063 --> 59:31.768
He went for a pack of
smokes and never came back?

59:32.635 --> 59:35.238
You believe that shit?

59:35.971 --> 59:38.239
Nah.

59:38.273 --> 59:40.643
I think
mom stole it from a movie.

59:40.675 --> 59:43.846
Yeah, she was
always good at lying for him.

59:46.215 --> 59:48.351
Was he really that bad Pike?

59:49.851 --> 59:52.788
Till I was old
enough to fight back.

59:56.958 --> 59:59.027
Couldn't have been all fight.

01:00:00.061 --> 01:00:01.730
You're lucky
you didn't know him.

01:00:20.449 --> 01:00:23.052
Man I miss this.

01:00:30.025 --> 01:00:32.795
Used to be
pretty good ya know? At ball.

01:00:32.827 --> 01:00:34.764
Yeah we've seen your trophies.

01:00:39.967 --> 01:00:42.904
Why'd ya stop playing?

01:00:42.938 --> 01:00:45.974
When you drop out of high
school they don't let ya play.

01:00:46.574 --> 01:00:51.012
Man, do you ever
remember Ma going to work?

01:00:51.045 --> 01:00:52.214
No.

01:00:56.117 --> 01:00:59.822
Being a nobody drop
out wasn't really a choice Jack.

01:01:00.956 --> 01:01:04.327
All the other kids my age were
coming through the drive-thru,

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:08.798
having fun, hanging out and I'm

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:12.334
stuck there 40 hours
a week making burgers.

01:01:12.367 --> 01:01:13.870
You regret it?

01:01:15.269 --> 01:01:17.273
Had you, had Ma...

01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:23.780
Sometimes you do things
that you don't wanna do.

01:01:25.847 --> 01:01:29.117
because you have to.

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:31.019
you man up.

01:01:31.052 --> 01:01:33.489
I've never
thought of it like that.

01:01:33.521 --> 01:01:35.324
That's the point.

01:01:35.356 --> 01:01:37.293
I did my job little brother.

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:39.327
I think ya did.

01:01:44.266 --> 01:01:45.501
Wanna see what ya got?

01:01:45.534 --> 01:01:46.802
I mean can ya handle it?

01:01:47.902 --> 01:01:49.370
Don't make me take it back.

01:01:49.403 --> 01:01:50.806
You won't.

01:01:59.847 --> 01:02:01.183
Jesus Christ okay.

01:02:02.083 --> 01:02:03.184
It wasn't that bad.

01:02:03.217 --> 01:02:04.452
Yeah it was.

01:02:04.485 --> 01:02:07.188
Alright so,
get your back elbow up-

01:02:07.222 --> 01:02:08.457
- Okay
- Feet shoulder width-

01:02:08.489 --> 01:02:09.958
- Alright
- Front shoulder down

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:11.760
- eye on the bag.
- Alright.

01:02:11.793 --> 01:02:13.161
Something like...

01:02:13.195 --> 01:02:15.164
Yeah. Bend the
knees, there ya go.

01:02:19.101 --> 01:02:21.436
You're looking at
the wall when you swing.

01:02:21.469 --> 01:02:23.071
Eyes on the bag.

01:02:26.942 --> 01:02:28.478
There ya go.

01:02:34.382 --> 01:02:36.785
You and uh...

01:02:37.485 --> 01:02:40.922
You and Jennifer would go
the batting cages wouldn't ya?

01:02:44.259 --> 01:02:46.128
I don't really
wanna talk about it, Jack.

01:02:49.463 --> 01:02:51.199
You know I miss her too?

01:02:52.467 --> 01:02:55.503
I'm sorry.

01:02:55.536 --> 01:02:57.539
Wasn't your fault.

01:03:01.342 --> 01:03:03.211
You have no idea, Jack.

01:03:03.244 --> 01:03:05.547
I'm just saying
man she had an addiction-

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:06.615
Watch your
fucking mouth-

01:03:06.648 --> 01:03:08.416
And you of all people
know how powerful that is-

01:03:08.449 --> 01:03:09.518
You don't have a clue-

01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:11.586
Pike, isn't it a bit
selfish to think that everything

01:03:11.619 --> 01:03:12.855
revolves around you?

01:03:12.887 --> 01:03:13.989
Oh my God!

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:16.959
That it's your fault for
Mom, Dad, Jennifer, everybody?

01:03:16.992 --> 01:03:19.128
Why the hell you
bringing up all this shit?

01:03:19.161 --> 01:03:23.199
Because fuck Dad and Mom
and anyone else who's ever made

01:03:23.231 --> 01:03:26.168
you feel that every
fucking thing was on you.

01:03:26.702 --> 01:03:28.437
Man do
you know why I am here?

01:03:28.469 --> 01:03:30.939
Because
you gave me a chance.

01:03:30.972 --> 01:03:33.375
And you know I know I
can never pay you back man,

01:03:33.909 --> 01:03:38.114
but I can have it. I do have it.

01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:40.349
But this shit...

01:03:40.382 --> 01:03:41.450
that you been living in

01:03:41.483 --> 01:03:44.452
for years now.

01:03:44.485 --> 01:03:45.420
Years.

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:47.089
Can't change what's
already happened Jack-

01:03:47.121 --> 01:03:49.357
But you can
let it go if you wanna.

01:04:04.572 --> 01:04:07.309
I'm not on your couch.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:30.266
Daddy!

01:04:30.298 --> 01:04:32.067
It's your fucking fault.

01:04:32.099 --> 01:04:34.536
I mean do you even
know why I'm here right now?

01:04:34.568 --> 01:04:37.373
It's your fucking fault.

01:04:37.405 --> 01:04:39.507
Because you
gave me a chance.

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:43.012
We're gonna
teach him how to swim.

01:04:43.478 --> 01:04:45.413
It's your fucking fault.

01:04:55.056 --> 01:04:57.492
I do not want.
I do not want another

01:04:57.525 --> 01:05:00.128
fucking little
runt lying around here.

01:05:00.161 --> 01:05:02.030
A fucking runt!

01:05:02.063 --> 01:05:04.532
I will fucking kill it!

01:05:41.436 --> 01:05:43.172
Hey Dad.

01:06:08.163 --> 01:06:09.530
Morning.

01:06:09.563 --> 01:06:11.266
You ready to go?

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.336
Yeah, I am.

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:16.704
I'm gonna get my stuff.

01:06:16.737 --> 01:06:18.440
Jack.

01:06:19.474 --> 01:06:21.077
Yeah?

01:06:22.811 --> 01:06:25.280
I'm sorry.

01:06:25.313 --> 01:06:27.016
What?

01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:31.652
Here. Before.

01:06:31.686 --> 01:06:34.090
Trying
to take my own life like that.

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:37.726
I just
didn't know you were that sad.

01:06:38.393 --> 01:06:41.262
I don't wanna
hurt you anymore.

01:06:46.434 --> 01:06:48.403
I'm gonna get my stuff.

01:06:48.436 --> 01:06:50.139
Jack.

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:55.311
You know I love you, right?

01:06:56.744 --> 01:06:58.279
Stace too.

01:07:31.278 --> 01:07:33.416
Pike?

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:52.735
Pike?

01:08:09.784 --> 01:08:12.153
Pike!

01:08:14.188 --> 01:08:16.291
Pike!

01:08:17.559 --> 01:08:18.527
What are you doing man?

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.728
Go home Jack!

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:20.729
What's wrong?

01:08:20.761 --> 01:08:21.862
Nothing's wrong yet!

01:08:21.895 --> 01:08:24.733
Not risking you going
to jail when your baby's coming!

01:08:25.832 --> 01:08:27.301
I'm gonna turn myself in.

01:08:27.335 --> 01:08:28.770
You're not thinking!

01:08:30.572 --> 01:08:32.707
That's exactly what I am doing.

01:08:36.411 --> 01:08:40.413
Okay, make sure this time
you fill it out. All the way,

01:08:40.448 --> 01:08:44.484
through to the end, I need to
hear all the descriptions you

01:08:44.519 --> 01:08:46.520
have of the assailant ma'am.

01:08:52.661 --> 01:08:54.895
Let me see.

01:09:02.904 --> 01:09:04.706
Excuse me.

01:09:04.738 --> 01:09:07.274
Excuse me sir,
there is a line and I will be

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:08.810
with you in a few minutes.

01:09:08.841 --> 01:09:10.546
No, no I
need to speak to someone.

01:09:10.578 --> 01:09:11.813
Then I need you to get to the

01:09:11.845 --> 01:09:13.915
back of the line and
wait like everybody else.

01:09:13.948 --> 01:09:15.683
Sorry, Excuse me!

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:18.854
Hey hey hey, if it's an
emergency you can use the

01:09:18.886 --> 01:09:21.889
payphone
and call 911, it's free.

01:09:21.921 --> 01:09:22.957
But I-

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:24.894
Is your life being
threatened at this moment sir?

01:09:29.395 --> 01:09:30.631
Well, no.

01:09:30.663 --> 01:09:31.733
Then I need you to get to

01:09:31.765 --> 01:09:34.301
the back of the line
and wait like everybody else.

01:09:36.438 --> 01:09:39.506
Sir! Please.
I will be with you when I can.

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:46.916
May I look at it?

01:09:51.685 --> 01:09:52.987
Keep it moving!

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.655
That's better.

01:09:54.689 --> 01:09:55.891
The heck you doing?

01:09:55.923 --> 01:09:57.626
What are you looking at, bitch?

01:09:57.658 --> 01:10:00.362
You done
messed up now! Let's go!

01:10:31.125 --> 01:10:32.962
Wasn't
meant to be little brother.

01:10:33.828 --> 01:10:34.897
Wait, what?

01:10:35.697 --> 01:10:37.298
Hey there!

01:10:37.332 --> 01:10:38.400
Oh shit!

01:10:38.432 --> 01:10:39.969
Hey stop!

01:11:07.828 --> 01:11:09.430
Jack!

01:11:33.121 --> 01:11:36.458
I fucked up.

01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:38.761
What happened?
What they say?

01:11:39.761 --> 01:11:41.096
I just couldn't do it.

01:11:41.128 --> 01:11:43.931
Got scared.

01:11:45.533 --> 01:11:47.336
Why didn't you leave?

01:11:47.368 --> 01:11:48.737
I don't know.

01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:50.772
Just go home Jack.

01:11:50.805 --> 01:11:52.574
Give me your lighter.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.949
What is this?

01:12:03.083 --> 01:12:05.787
Some food.

01:12:05.819 --> 01:12:07.889
You got any quarters?

01:12:10.792 --> 01:12:12.795
There we go.

01:12:13.561 --> 01:12:15.930
Do you want
cookies or donuts?

01:12:15.963 --> 01:12:17.733
Donuts.

01:12:17.765 --> 01:12:19.534
No problem.

01:12:24.639 --> 01:12:26.408
This is some kind of...

01:12:27.007 --> 01:12:29.912
storage space or something.

01:12:32.046 --> 01:12:34.383
How old is this shit?

01:12:35.015 --> 01:12:38.052
That's what you
get for making me run.

01:12:38.752 --> 01:12:41.523
Should have just went to jail.

01:13:26.667 --> 01:13:28.469
Whoa.

01:13:32.673 --> 01:13:35.610
Think they got a bar?

01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:04.539
Pike what the hell you doing?

01:14:05.239 --> 01:14:06.707
Bowling!

01:14:08.676 --> 01:14:10.812
Put those on.

01:14:10.845 --> 01:14:14.983
Sign says they're closed for
remodeling. For like a month.

01:14:24.692 --> 01:14:27.829
Come on man!

01:14:28.662 --> 01:14:30.465
Get me a beer!

01:14:42.243 --> 01:14:44.480
Watch this one.

01:14:51.618 --> 01:14:52.920
You got this!

01:15:00.962 --> 01:15:04.099
Dude, you
wanna get the ball and knock

01:15:04.131 --> 01:15:06.902
down all the pins, you
understand the concept of this?

01:15:07.335 --> 01:15:08.936
You got it?

01:15:10.238 --> 01:15:12.074
I think so.

01:15:47.841 --> 01:15:49.577
Get it
Pike! Get it! Get it!

01:15:50.211 --> 01:15:52.646
- Two! Three!
- Oh that's not fair!

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.851
We're
number one! We're number one!

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:01.924
Clear! Clear!

01:16:26.279 --> 01:16:27.882
Oh man!

01:16:28.682 --> 01:16:31.353
Why didn't we do
this shit more often?

01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:35.324
Man I
would tell Stacey, you were a

01:16:37.158 --> 01:16:39.261
breakfast kind of guy.

01:16:45.099 --> 01:16:48.604
When you're smoking that shit.

01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:58.380
Ya know...

01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:03.784
I was thinking about,
maybe coaching some baseball.

01:17:03.818 --> 01:17:04.819
Yeah?

01:17:04.853 --> 01:17:07.756
Yeah I mean. I think
I'd be good at it ya know?

01:17:08.122 --> 01:17:10.759
You'd be great.

01:17:12.225 --> 01:17:16.263
This is a
second chance. I get that.

01:17:17.331 --> 01:17:19.300
Yeah.

01:17:19.332 --> 01:17:23.738
I want a hit so bad
right now. You have no idea.

01:17:27.341 --> 01:17:29.778
It's just not
worth a trip to hell.

01:17:31.412 --> 01:17:33.914
I just don't want
you to worry that...

01:17:35.182 --> 01:17:37.752
I'm not gonna be right.

01:17:37.784 --> 01:17:38.853
Yeah.

01:17:38.886 --> 01:17:43.425
Just don't ya to wonder
and then just not bring him.

01:17:44.792 --> 01:17:47.862

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:02.309

01:18:02.342 --> 01:18:04.011
You're fucking crazy.

01:18:05.813 --> 01:18:09.417

01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:14.388

01:18:21.962 --> 01:18:24.331

01:18:25.265 --> 01:18:27.335

01:18:28.034 --> 01:18:30.238
That's the
thing about it man.

01:18:34.307 --> 01:18:36.043
You're gonna love it.

01:18:38.345 --> 01:18:41.015
And I think

01:19:05.072 --> 01:19:06.541

Are you fucking crazy?

01:19:31.231 --> 01:19:34.202
Probably.

01:19:34.234 --> 01:19:36.203
This baby's

01:19:37.104 --> 01:19:40.341
Okay.

Give me a chance.

01:19:53.954 --> 01:19:56.024
I love you.

01:19:56.957 --> 01:19:59.493
I'll guess we'll see.

01:19:59.527 --> 01:20:02.364
I don't wanna do this alone.

01:20:03.898 --> 01:20:04.998
Don't hang up yet.

01:20:05.032 --> 01:20:07.235
Come home.

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:42.937
Put
your dad on the phone,

01:20:42.970 --> 01:20:44.139
it's Jack.

01:20:46.039 --> 01:20:48.275
Pike! Get up!

01:20:49.243 --> 01:20:50.478
Get up!

01:20:50.511 --> 01:20:52.213
What, what is going on?

01:20:52.246 --> 01:20:55.516
Just here to
touch up some walls.

01:20:55.548 --> 01:20:57.551
I never saw ya.

01:20:57.585 --> 01:20:59.354

01:20:59.386 --> 01:21:00.420
That your van outside?

01:21:00.453 --> 01:21:01.521
Yes sir.

01:21:01.555 --> 01:21:02.523
Anybody with ya?

01:21:02.555 --> 01:21:03.891
No sir.

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.627
Alright, here's
what's going to happen.

01:21:06.327 --> 01:21:08.429
You're
gonna drive us up past Detroit,

01:21:08.462 --> 01:21:10.165
to the St. Clair
River you understand?

01:21:10.997 --> 01:21:12.432
I think so, sir.

01:21:12.466 --> 01:21:14.536
Pike, get around.

01:21:20.373 --> 01:21:22.644
Don't.

01:21:51.037 --> 01:21:52.673
Can I smoke?

01:21:53.606 --> 01:21:55.377
Do I have a choice?

01:21:59.079 --> 01:22:03.283
I'm sorry. For pulling the

01:22:03.317 --> 01:22:06.287
bow on ya earlier.

01:22:06.319 --> 01:22:07.956
But you understand.

01:22:15.662 --> 01:22:17.197
Shit.

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:21.269
What do I do?

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:24.072
Pull over. Act normal.

01:22:26.673 --> 01:22:28.976
Another 100 when we get there.

01:23:04.744 --> 01:23:06.480
Hello there.

01:23:07.448 --> 01:23:09.484
Were we speeding officer?

01:23:09.516 --> 01:23:11.185
License and registration.

01:23:20.461 --> 01:23:22.262
You
guys heading back home?

01:23:22.296 --> 01:23:26.400
Yes, yes sir. We were on a job.

01:23:33.407 --> 01:23:35.476
Can you step out
of the vehicle please?

01:23:47.354 --> 01:23:49.724
Let me show you
why I pulled you over.

01:23:58.565 --> 01:24:00.501
My brother-in-law
has a similar van.

01:24:00.533 --> 01:24:02.202
A year earlier.

01:24:02.235 --> 01:24:03.270
All you do is here.

01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:05.672
Just pop that little
compartment out right there,

01:24:06.305 --> 01:24:08.708
you can pick up one of
these bulbs for like 60 cents.

01:24:08.742 --> 01:24:10.078
Real cheap.

01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:13.213
Oh okay. Yeah, I'll do that sir.

01:24:13.247 --> 01:24:15.450
Yeah, piece of cake.

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:31.432
You have a nice day...

01:24:31.465 --> 01:24:32.534
Drive safe.

01:24:32.766 --> 01:24:34.234
Thank you.

01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:11.439
So you know this guy?

01:25:11.471 --> 01:25:15.210
We go back. I trust them.

01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:18.746
Well I guess this is it.

01:25:26.753 --> 01:25:28.756
You saved my life.

01:26:10.597 --> 01:26:11.932
You hungry?

01:26:11.966 --> 01:26:14.235
No...

01:26:15.469 --> 01:26:17.505
I gotta go home.

01:26:56.542 --> 01:26:57.545
You Pike?

01:26:57.578 --> 01:26:58.613
Yeah.

01:27:01.914 --> 01:27:02.949
You play?

01:27:02.983 --> 01:27:04.485
No.

01:27:10.891 --> 01:27:12.659
Are we going?

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:16.965
Every hour border
patrol swipes through here.

01:27:17.898 --> 01:27:19.766
Same times everyday.

01:27:20.434 --> 01:27:22.770
So we got a few.

01:27:23.636 --> 01:27:25.305
Make yourself at home.

01:27:36.382 --> 01:27:37.684
Give me a beat.

01:27:38.484 --> 01:27:39.786
What?

01:27:39.819 --> 01:27:43.357
Give me a beat. Like
a boom boom boom.

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:46.527
It'll make the time go faster.

01:27:49.462 --> 01:27:51.398
Give me a beat.

01:28:04.545 --> 01:28:06.747
There you go.

01:29:06.006 --> 01:29:07.975
Why'd ya stop?

01:29:08.007 --> 01:29:10.345
That's as far
as a man can go.

01:29:11.177 --> 01:29:12.979
What?

01:29:13.012 --> 01:29:14.782
You can swim from here.

01:29:15.548 --> 01:29:18.752
I can't swim.

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:20.020
Well I can't dock son.

01:29:20.052 --> 01:29:21.253
Take me closer.

01:29:21.287 --> 01:29:24.692
No no, Jack already paid me
and it's not worth anymore risk.

01:29:25.725 --> 01:29:27.694
You wanna go back?

01:30:00.594 --> 01:30:05.399
It's now or never.

01:31:48.969 --> 01:31:51.706
It's beautiful.

01:32:10.657 --> 01:32:13.793
They say the suspect
is 43 year old Philip Ables.

01:32:13.827 --> 01:32:17.297
Who goes by the name of Pike. If
you have any information on his

01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:20.333
whereabouts, you are urged
to contact your local police or

01:32:20.367 --> 01:32:23.604
dial 911. We
will keep you posted-

01:32:44.692 --> 01:32:46.927
No! Come on, Billy, grab him!

01:33:11.685 --> 01:33:16.023
He's out cold.
Sure you wanna do this?

01:33:47.087 --> 01:33:48.856
This it?

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:50.757
Yep, end of the line.

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:52.326
Alright, let's do this.

01:35:29.322 --> 01:35:32.393
What happened last
night? You remember anything?

01:35:33.527 --> 01:35:36.262
Man I don't
know I blacked! Blacked!

01:35:36.296 --> 01:35:37.463
You must
have done something.

01:35:37.497 --> 01:35:39.333
Butch called me last night
said they were looking for ya.

01:35:40.199 --> 01:35:41.868
You sober now?

01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:43.904
When you're smoking that shit.

01:35:43.936 --> 01:35:45.171
I flushed it.

01:35:46.939 --> 01:35:48.808
It's my brand.

01:35:50.944 --> 01:35:53.848
Jack already paid me and
it's not worth anymore risk.

01:35:54.314 --> 01:35:57.917
Keep your back elbow up,
feet shoulder width, front

01:35:57.951 --> 01:35:59.386
shoulder down, eye on the bag.

01:35:59.418 --> 01:36:03.323
I got at least, a dime of boss.

01:36:03.856 --> 01:36:08.962
And you know I can never pay
you back, but man I can have it.

01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:12.099
I do have it.

01:36:13.033 --> 01:36:14.468
Ow wow wow wow!

01:36:14.501 --> 01:36:16.904
This truck is bitchin'!

01:36:26.412 --> 01:36:27.446
She in here?

01:36:27.479 --> 01:36:28.547
Sir you can't go in here.

01:36:28.581 --> 01:36:31.918
Pike,
if you're reading this your home.

01:36:31.952 --> 01:36:33.988
And I'm sorry
for lying to you.

01:36:34.354 --> 01:36:36.556
But I felt
like I didn't have a choice.

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:39.460
I was gonna lose you.

01:36:40.594 --> 01:36:43.430
You were
just on that path and I thought

01:36:43.462 --> 01:36:45.298
I needed to save you.

01:36:45.931 --> 01:36:49.336
Funny thing is,
I think you saved me too.

01:36:52.137 --> 01:36:55.309
I still need you
big brother. I always will.

01:36:55.341 --> 01:36:58.845
Maternity ward, is right down
the hall. Then you take a left.

01:37:03.115 --> 01:37:05.886
I hope I can make things right.

01:37:08.354 --> 01:37:09.722
Think fast!

01:37:09.756 --> 01:37:14.193
Here's your news at
the top of the hour. State Police

01:37:14.226 --> 01:37:16.896

01:37:16.930 --> 01:37:19.365

Who goes by
the name of Pike...

01:37:35.414 --> 01:37:37.484
Don't take
those bandages off.

01:37:39.485 --> 01:37:42.055
Looks like ya cut it.

01:37:44.925 --> 01:37:46.994
I mean they're saying I did it,

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:49.896
looks like I did it.

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:57.163
It's not my fault.
