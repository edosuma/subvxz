10:30.379 --> 10:31.714
- I want a souffle.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.591
- Why are you getting
Michael a souffle?

10:33.674 --> 10:35.217
- You know...

10:35.301 --> 10:36.385
for his birthday.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.179
- Wasn't his birthday, like,

10:38.262 --> 10:40.181
a month ago?

10:40.264 --> 10:41.557
- Exactly.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.101
And I didn't get him anything,

10:44.185 --> 10:45.436
so souffle.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.813
- Where are you?
- Vaccaro.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.690
- Where is he?
- Vaccaro!

10:49.774 --> 10:50.900
- Oh, my God!

10:50.983 --> 10:52.735
I hear their souffles
are amazing.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.196
- Yeah,
but you gotta eat them hot.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.114
Hey, man?
- Yeah?

10:57.198 --> 10:57.990
- Don't bring me the souffle.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.784
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

10:59.867 --> 11:02.078
- What?
- Come on.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.038
You don't--
[dial tone]

11:05.456 --> 11:07.375
He hung up.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.920
- Well, since you're here

11:11.003 --> 11:13.547
getting a souffle for Michael,

11:13.631 --> 11:15.716
why don't you...

11:15.800 --> 11:17.259
sit down with us?

11:19.178 --> 11:20.388
- Oh.

11:20.471 --> 11:21.430
Well,

11:21.514 --> 11:22.098
I don't like you.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.099
- Right, yeah--

11:23.182 --> 11:24.683
- But, sure.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.738
So...

11:37.822 --> 11:39.365
here we are.
[chuckles]

11:39.448 --> 11:40.199
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.326
- Here we are.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.120
- The four of us.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.258
- Uh...can I help you?

11:57.341 --> 11:58.467
- Oh, yeah.
We're here to meet a guy

11:58.551 --> 12:00.970
named Logan, our age,

12:01.053 --> 12:03.139
sorta good-looking.

12:03.222 --> 12:03.889
- Sorta.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.100
- Mr. Preese.
- Reese.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.351
- No P.
- You're certain?

12:07.435 --> 12:10.062
- Completely.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.689
- He's in the main dining area.

12:11.772 --> 12:12.731
- Bye!
- Thanks.

12:12.815 --> 12:13.816
- [sputtering]

12:13.899 --> 12:15.317
Jackets are required

12:15.401 --> 12:17.611
for all gentlemen
in the dining area.

12:17.695 --> 12:21.240
- Well, I don't have a jacket.

12:21.323 --> 12:24.452
- Perhaps we have one
you can borrow.

12:24.535 --> 12:27.163
- So that wasn't
the first time you ever saw me?

12:27.246 --> 12:28.414
JAMES: No.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.665
Actually, when I was trying
to find

12:29.748 --> 12:31.041
the housing office,
I saw you by the fountain.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.002
- And your first thought was?

12:33.085 --> 12:35.504
- You know,
that you were insanely adorable.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.505
[both chuckle]

12:36.589 --> 12:38.215
- Oh, come on!

12:39.258 --> 12:41.969
Dude,
she's already dating you.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.929
You don't have to lie
to her anymore.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.307
- I wasn't lying.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.809
- Could you just eat
your lobster?

12:48.893 --> 12:50.644
- Did you guys know that
lobsters in captivity

12:50.728 --> 12:52.354
sometimes
resort to cannibalism?

12:52.438 --> 12:53.522
- Cannibalism?

12:53.606 --> 12:55.900
- Yeah, they eat their friends.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.693
QUINN: We know because
marine biologists

12:57.776 --> 12:58.861
have found lobster skin

12:58.944 --> 13:01.071
in the stomachs
of other lobsters.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.948
- I wish a lobster
would eat me.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.368
- Hi, guys!
- Hey, what's up?

13:06.452 --> 13:07.995
- Ah, why?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.625
- Michael and Lola are here?

13:12.708 --> 13:13.834
- James.

13:14.418 --> 13:16.253
- Hi, guys!

13:16.337 --> 13:17.713
- Hey, man!

13:17.796 --> 13:18.506
I didn't know everybody
was here with you.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.382
- Yeah, isn't it great?

13:20.466 --> 13:22.718
- I-I came alone.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.011
- I didn't even know Quinn
was gonna be here.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.387
- He sure didn't.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.390
- What's with the jacket?

13:28.474 --> 13:31.060
- Ah, the stupid maitre d'
made me wear it.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.394
Says they have a "dress code."

13:32.478 --> 13:34.563
- And why are you here?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.315
I told you I'd bring you
the souffle.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.775
- Souffles aren't yummy
unless you eat them

13:37.858 --> 13:39.235
right out of the oven.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.029
- But before we started
talking souffles,

13:42.112 --> 13:44.698
looks like there's plenty
of lobster to go around!

13:44.782 --> 13:46.909
- Lobster!

13:46.992 --> 13:49.161
MICHAEL: Yeah.
Tasty.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.580
- Oh, my God!

13:51.664 --> 13:53.624
This bread looks so good.

13:53.707 --> 13:54.833
And it's warm!

13:54.917 --> 13:57.002
- Hey, pass me
the melted butter.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.087
- We should push the tables
together

13:58.170 --> 13:59.547
so we can all sit closer.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.382
- I-I don't think that--

14:05.052 --> 14:05.928
- Here, Zoey,

14:06.011 --> 14:06.971
slide your chair this way.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.722
- No, I'm fine right--
Aah!

14:08.806 --> 14:10.224
[diners exclaim]

14:10.307 --> 14:12.434
- Zo--

14:14.728 --> 14:17.398
- Are you all right?
- No!

14:18.816 --> 14:20.526
- Oh, here.

14:20.609 --> 14:23.112
A hunk of lobster
will make you feel better.

this looks so good!

14:39.920 --> 14:40.963
MICHAEL: Mm-hmm.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.383
- This smells so good.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.302
- You're gonna pay
for my food, right?

14:46.385 --> 14:47.678
It was my birthday a month ago.

14:47.761 --> 14:48.762
- I had a birthday last year.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.889
I'll pay for it.
- Really?

14:50.973 --> 14:52.099
- Not yours.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.809
- You can't blame a guy
for trying.

14:53.892 --> 14:56.437
- Would you pass me
a crab cake?

14:56.520 --> 14:57.563
- Oh, sure.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.148
- Ooh, I want a crab cake.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.066
- Me, too!
- I'll take one.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.655
- James.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.948
- Yeah?

15:09.199 --> 15:11.827
Right.
Excuse us.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.037
- Mmm!

15:13.120 --> 15:15.748
Is it wrong to be in love
with a crab cake?

15:15.831 --> 15:16.790
- If it's wrong,

15:16.874 --> 15:19.084
I don't wanna be right.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.961
- Did you guys know that crabs
are omnivores

15:21.045 --> 15:23.339
that eat algae
and fungus and worms?

15:23.422 --> 15:25.382
- Algae and fungus and worms?

15:25.466 --> 15:26.050
- Oh, my!

15:29.803 --> 15:31.513
- Come on, don't be mad.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.514
- I'm not mad, I'm frustrated.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.850
And I feel bad for you.

15:34.933 --> 15:35.851
- Why do you feel bad for me--

15:35.934 --> 15:37.019
- You're probably using half

15:37.102 --> 15:37.853
of your savings
to pay for tonight.

15:37.936 --> 15:40.314
- Three-fourths of my savings.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.232
- [sighs]
I'm sad.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.651
- Zo--

15:43.734 --> 15:45.027
- This was supposed to be
a special date

15:45.110 --> 15:46.362
for just the two of us.

15:46.445 --> 15:47.613
- So, it's turned into
a special date

15:47.696 --> 15:50.866
for the two of us
with four of our good friends.

15:50.949 --> 15:51.450
That so bad?

15:51.533 --> 15:53.535
- No.

15:54.662 --> 15:55.663
But I want a crab cake.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.956
- I think that can be arranged.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.875
- And I want both kinds
of sauce.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.335
- I understand.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.129
LOLA: Ooh, nice fork up!

16:08.467 --> 16:09.718

16:09.802 --> 16:10.761

- Everything okay?

16:10.844 --> 16:13.597
- Yeah, everything's great.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.225
- Pass the asparagus.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.519
- Asparagi for Ms. Brooks.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.772
- Did you guys know that
asparagus makes your--

16:21.855 --> 16:22.731
- We know.
- Shh.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.316
- Don't.
- Please.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.406
- Hey, isn't that guy
over there Carl?

16:34.702 --> 16:35.994
- I think that is Carl.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.122
- Who's Carl?
- Coco's boyfriend.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.873
- Hungry, hungry Coco?

16:39.957 --> 16:40.916
- Yup.

16:40.999 --> 16:42.000
- I thought Coco
was still dating him.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.586
- She is.
- Then why is he on a date

16:44.670 --> 16:45.504
with another woman?

16:45.587 --> 16:47.506
- Maybe they're not on a date.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.008
- They're holding hands
across the table.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.010
- Quinn, come with me.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.470
- What are you gonna do?

16:53.554 --> 16:54.972
- We're gonna go tell Carl
that he's busted.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.181
- And then we're gonna
tell Coco we saw him

16:56.265 --> 16:57.850
out with another woman.
- Yeah, look,

16:57.933 --> 17:00.477
maybe you shouldn't interfere--
- Eat your meatball.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.858
Hey, yo, Carl.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.109
- Oh, hey.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.989
You girls go to PCA, right?

17:12.071 --> 17:13.073
- Yeah, we do.

17:13.156 --> 17:15.534
- You know our dorm advisor,
Coco.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.536
- Your girlfriend?

17:17.618 --> 17:18.787
- Right, right.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.582
- So, who's she?

17:21.665 --> 17:23.375
- Listen, can we talk about
this another time?

17:23.459 --> 17:25.252
- No!

17:25.335 --> 17:26.420
- But we're gonna talk to Coco,

17:26.502 --> 17:27.796
and you better believe--
- Will you guys

17:27.880 --> 17:29.173
get out of here?
- Don't tell us what to do!

17:29.256 --> 17:31.467
- It's a free restaurant,
lady.

17:31.550 --> 17:32.968
Well, you have to pay
for the food,

17:33.051 --> 17:34.595
but you know what I mean!

17:37.139 --> 17:38.098
- Coco?

17:38.182 --> 17:40.017
- Shh!

17:40.100 --> 17:41.268
Follow me to the can!

17:51.195 --> 17:53.155
Are you trying to ruin my life?

17:53.238 --> 17:55.115
- Why are you wearing
a disguise?

17:55.199 --> 17:56.325
- 'Cause remember
when I worked here

17:56.408 --> 17:57.826
as a restroom attendant?

17:57.910 --> 17:58.869
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah...

17:58.952 --> 18:00.204
- Well, when I quit,

18:00.287 --> 18:01.663
I got into a fight
with the maitre d'.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.040
He told me
I had to finish out the night,

18:03.123 --> 18:04.416
so I told him to go sit
on a squash.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.709
Then we got into a fight.

18:05.793 --> 18:06.752
I hit him with a beef rib,
he fell down,

18:06.835 --> 18:09.171
and I ran out the door.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.715
- So...the disguise?

18:11.799 --> 18:12.841
- [sighs]

18:12.925 --> 18:15.010
I was banned from
ever coming back here.

18:15.093 --> 18:17.513
But Carl and I wanted to have
a special dinner date

18:17.596 --> 18:18.806
to celebrate the end
of his house arrest.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.974
So, I just figured why not--

18:21.058 --> 18:22.559
- Well...

18:22.643 --> 18:23.852
I guess someone
doesn't understand

18:23.936 --> 18:26.855
what "banned" means.

18:26.939 --> 18:27.981
- Maurice, listen.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.525
- Oh, get out of my sight.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.861
- Wait, why are you
in the women's restroom?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.530
- He likes the lollipops.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.199
- I want you
and your little chicky friends

18:37.282 --> 18:38.367
out of here.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.618
- You can't throw us out.

18:39.701 --> 18:40.410
- Yeah, look, Maurice--

18:40.494 --> 18:41.370
- Yes, I can throw you out.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.455
Turn around, there's the exit.

to call the police.

19:11.984 --> 19:12.943
