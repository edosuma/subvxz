00:33.993 --> 00:35.745
<i>Come in close.</i>

00:37.080 --> 00:38.373
<i>Closer.</i>

00:39.249 --> 00:42.252
<i>Because the more you think you see,</i>

00:42.335 --> 00:44.754
<i>the easier it'll be to fool you.</i>

00:46.381 --> 00:48.299
<i>Because what is seeing?</i>

00:48.383 --> 00:52.387
<i>You're looking, but what you're really doing
is filtering, interpreting,</i>

00:52.470 --> 00:54.431
<i>searching for meaning.</i>

00:56.433 --> 00:57.684
<i>My job?</i>

00:57.767 --> 01:01.771
<i>To take that most precious of gifts
you give me, your attention,</i>

01:04.649 --> 01:06.735
<i>and use it against you.</i>

01:11.865 --> 01:14.075
I'm going to flip through this deck.

01:14.159 --> 01:15.660
And I want you to see one card.

01:15.744 --> 01:17.162
Not this one. That's too obvious.

01:17.579 --> 01:18.872
Pay close attention.

01:21.458 --> 01:22.751
That was too fast. I'll do it again.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.043
Are you ready?

01:24.127 --> 01:25.128
Okay.

01:27.172 --> 01:28.965
- Now did you see one?
- Yes.

01:29.132 --> 01:31.050
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

01:31.259 --> 01:32.969
Now, do you see your card here?

01:33.595 --> 01:34.554
No.

01:34.637 --> 01:36.848
That's because you're looking too closely.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.975
And what have I been telling you all night?

01:39.058 --> 01:40.518
The closer you look...

01:40.602 --> 01:42.145
The less you see.

02:05.376 --> 02:07.796
Now look into my eyes.

02:08.003 --> 02:10.048
And sleep. Okay.

02:13.343 --> 02:14.552
And...

02:15.720 --> 02:18.306
If you can get this bill
from me, you can have it.

02:18.515 --> 02:20.350
Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

02:20.558 --> 02:23.061
If you can say your name, you can have it.

02:26.231 --> 02:28.650
All right, just hang out there, wriggle a sec.

02:28.733 --> 02:31.110
I'm gonna take a little peek under the hood

02:31.194 --> 02:32.737
-of your hubby's brain.
- Oh, no, no, no.

02:32.821 --> 02:33.947
I'm picturing...

02:34.030 --> 02:36.032
- Don't tell me.
- Of course.

02:36.241 --> 02:38.243
Beach. Cocktails.

02:38.701 --> 02:39.869
Florida?

02:39.953 --> 02:41.454
Look, it was a business trip.

02:41.621 --> 02:43.623
I mean, it is a kind of business.

02:43.706 --> 02:46.584
Maybe the oldest business.

02:46.709 --> 02:47.919
You know what, Honey Bee, let's...

02:48.044 --> 02:49.546
She can't move, Mack.

02:49.629 --> 02:51.047
You're thinking of a woman's name.

02:51.256 --> 02:52.590
A! B! C!

02:52.674 --> 02:53.925
DI El Fl GI

02:54.008 --> 02:55.134
H, I, J...

02:55.260 --> 02:57.053
J? Jean. Jane. Janet.

02:57.262 --> 02:58.346
Who's Janet?

02:59.973 --> 03:01.182
You know Janet?

03:01.307 --> 03:02.559
It's not your best friend, is it?

03:03.935 --> 03:05.562
- Your sister?
- No, please.

03:05.645 --> 03:07.897
Her sister? Oh, my God.

03:07.981 --> 03:10.024
You weren't away on business.

03:10.108 --> 03:11.860
- You were away on Janet.
- No.

03:11.943 --> 03:13.236
Your wife's sister!

03:14.195 --> 03:15.905
Okay, we need to move over here,

03:15.989 --> 03:18.533
because it seems like
she's a little bit upset right now.

03:18.616 --> 03:20.827
You want this to go away?

03:20.910 --> 03:22.579
- Yes.
- Okay, pull out your wallet.

03:23.121 --> 03:24.581
Come on, get it out.

03:24.664 --> 03:25.957
Do you shake down everybody like this?

03:26.082 --> 03:27.834
No, only the special few.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.003
What is this? Two hundred seem fair?

03:30.086 --> 03:32.171
You know what?
This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

03:32.255 --> 03:33.256
You're a stick-up artist.

03:33.339 --> 03:35.008
Yeah. Of course.

03:35.758 --> 03:38.553
Okay, and sleep!

03:38.636 --> 03:40.013
Now, when I snap my fingers,

03:40.096 --> 03:41.556
you won't remember any of this.

03:41.639 --> 03:42.849
And you, Warren Beatty,

03:43.099 --> 03:45.935
every time you see or even think of Janet,

03:46.269 --> 03:48.730
you're gonna picture me naked.

03:48.813 --> 03:49.939
And that's not a pretty sight.

03:50.023 --> 03:51.024
Yeah.

03:51.107 --> 03:53.276
And... You're wide awake!

03:56.362 --> 03:58.865
Well, we did the best we could,

03:58.948 --> 04:01.117
but some people
just aren't to be hypnotized.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.494
- I did it wrong?
- Come on, Honey Bee.

04:03.620 --> 04:05.288
- Oh, no, you did it fine.
- Let me buy you dinner.

04:05.455 --> 04:06.623
Look after her.

04:06.706 --> 04:08.458
Just have to hit an ATM first.

04:22.597 --> 04:26.184
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the next great magician,

04:26.267 --> 04:28.436
and I will give $100

04:28.519 --> 04:30.855
to anyone who can tell me
how this trick is done.

04:31.064 --> 04:34.567
I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's Deli,
right here in Brooklyn.

04:34.651 --> 04:36.069
Check it out.

04:36.152 --> 04:39.822
Now, everyone
please pay very, very close attention.

04:40.031 --> 04:43.409
Because I'm about to
bend this spoon with my mind.

04:53.628 --> 04:56.005
Thank you. Thank you. Pass that around.

04:56.089 --> 04:57.590
- What's this?
- What are you doing, man?

04:57.674 --> 05:00.927
Look at this! Looks like
we got a spoon and a stem.

05:01.010 --> 05:02.136
I've got other tricks.

05:02.220 --> 05:04.430
Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

05:04.514 --> 05:05.598
You said you would.

05:05.682 --> 05:06.933
Nice wallet.

05:07.016 --> 05:08.226
You have a very good eye, sir.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.310
Thanks.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.819
Wallet.

05:18.027 --> 05:20.196
My wallet. My watch!

05:24.867 --> 05:25.952
Stop that guy!

05:26.035 --> 05:27.161
Stop that guy in the leather jacket!

05:27.245 --> 05:28.246
He's got my wallet!

05:36.671 --> 05:38.047
Okay, Los Angeles,

05:38.131 --> 05:39.799
are we ready to end this thing?

05:39.882 --> 05:40.883
Yeah!

05:40.967 --> 05:43.011
When that timer hits zero,

05:43.469 --> 05:45.805
a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

05:45.888 --> 05:47.807
will fall from above.

05:47.890 --> 05:50.601
A lady has to have handcuffs. Right, girls?

05:50.893 --> 05:53.563
One, two, three!

06:11.205 --> 06:12.206
Yeah!

06:22.550 --> 06:24.260
Help! Stop it!

06:26.179 --> 06:27.930
She's serious! She can't get out!

06:30.057 --> 06:31.517
Go get some help!

06:32.226 --> 06:33.394
Help, dude!

06:34.937 --> 06:37.231
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

07:16.229 --> 07:18.272
Come on! This is bullshit!

07:18.397 --> 07:21.609
Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

07:26.072 --> 07:27.281
Yes!

07:29.075 --> 07:30.660
I am your biggest fan.

07:30.743 --> 07:32.662
I could tell by the way
you're attacking my face right now.

07:32.745 --> 07:33.996
Close the door. Bad apartment building.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.665
- Magician, come here.
- Okay.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.335
- Wait, wait.
- What? What?

07:39.418 --> 07:40.878
How did you do that...

07:40.962 --> 07:42.296
The seven of diamonds
on the side of the tower?

07:42.380 --> 07:43.923
- Yes.
- That's a trade secret.

07:46.050 --> 07:48.386
I'll give you a hint. It involved
bribing the tower electrician.

07:48.469 --> 07:49.554
How much?

07:49.637 --> 07:50.638
50 bucks.

07:50.930 --> 07:52.807
- But it's so hard.
- Oh, thank you.

07:52.932 --> 07:54.016
Is it always a seven?

07:54.100 --> 07:55.685
I could do that trick 52 different ways.

07:55.768 --> 07:57.645
Can you do 52 different tricks on me?

07:58.062 --> 07:59.146
I'll see what I can do.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.107
Magic man!

08:01.482 --> 08:02.900
I love your shampoo.

08:05.194 --> 08:06.445
- Hold up.
- What?

08:08.823 --> 08:09.866
You need to leave.

08:09.949 --> 08:10.950
Are you kidding me?

08:11.158 --> 08:13.160
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

08:13.411 --> 08:14.412
Is this what you do?

08:14.495 --> 08:16.455
Some kind of sick trick you do to women?

08:16.622 --> 08:18.749
"45 East Evan Street."

08:18.916 --> 08:20.334
Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

08:20.501 --> 08:21.919
You don't have my number.

08:22.128 --> 08:24.171
I'm magic. I'll find it. Have a good night.

08:24.255 --> 08:25.756
You are such an asshole.

09:38.329 --> 09:39.372
Hey!

09:40.498 --> 09:41.540
Henley.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.918
Danny? Hey.

09:44.335 --> 09:46.796
You got a card, huh?

09:47.755 --> 09:50.007
No,no,no,
it's good for you. Congratulations.

09:50.091 --> 09:51.092
All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

09:51.217 --> 09:52.468
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

09:52.551 --> 09:53.761
You wait out here. I will come back

09:53.844 --> 09:54.929
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.764
Hey, Danny! I'm not your assistant anymore.

09:57.056 --> 09:58.349
Nice hair.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.142
So, actually, what have you been up to?

10:00.226 --> 10:02.353
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

10:02.436 --> 10:05.189
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.524
You have a website. That's good.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.359
Good for you. Get the word out.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.321
Okay.

10:12.405 --> 10:15.574
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.285
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.537
Yeah. Excuse me.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.414
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

10:21.580 --> 10:24.083
You. Now, hold it, don't tell me.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.751
Helen? No, no.

10:25.918 --> 10:27.294
Henley.

10:27.378 --> 10:28.587
It's on your coffee cup.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.464
Thanks for keeping me honest.

10:30.548 --> 10:32.091
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.

10:32.216 --> 10:33.300
It was just an observation.

10:33.426 --> 10:36.971
Second observation, you are beautiful.

10:37.388 --> 10:38.180
Thank you.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.975
That's good. That's very nice.
Very well-polished. Nice bit.

10:41.058 --> 10:43.310
J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

10:43.561 --> 10:45.187
Very nice. I know
who you are and I just want to say that

10:45.312 --> 10:46.272
I'm not interested in you doing

10:46.355 --> 10:47.523
your mentalism thing on us.

10:47.773 --> 10:50.276
Especially when we don't know
who brought us here or even if it's real.

10:51.027 --> 10:55.114
Hold on, I'm sensing...
I'm sensing you are a control freak.

10:55.197 --> 10:56.449
I'm sorry, have we met before?

10:56.532 --> 10:57.950
It doesn't take a mentalist to figure that out.

10:58.034 --> 10:59.118
You are a control freak.

10:59.201 --> 11:01.287
Well, I take that as a compliment.

11:01.370 --> 11:02.747
Only he would take it as a compliment.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.832
Okay, great. Good. Another compliment.

11:04.915 --> 11:08.294
Okay. So that's why
you're no longer a couple.

11:08.377 --> 11:09.462
A couple? No, no.

11:09.545 --> 11:10.755
We were never a couple.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.631
He used to saw me in half.

11:12.715 --> 11:13.758
She was a very good assistant.

11:13.841 --> 11:14.884
But I was too fat for Danny.

11:14.967 --> 11:17.803
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

11:17.887 --> 11:19.889
- There were specs.
- You built it this size.

11:19.972 --> 11:21.474
No one could fit through there. No one.

11:21.557 --> 11:22.725
Rebecca fit through.

11:22.892 --> 11:24.477
Rebecca fit for years.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.228
Do you know how hard it is to stay

11:26.353 --> 11:28.189
in those tiny little costumes?

11:28.397 --> 11:30.232
No. I'm the main attraction.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.485
Okay. So he never made you feel special.

11:32.568 --> 11:36.489
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

11:36.572 --> 11:37.990
That's a really nice story.

11:38.074 --> 11:39.742
Hope you guys enjoy each other's company.

11:39.992 --> 11:41.160
No way.

11:42.328 --> 11:43.913
J. Daniel Atlas?

11:44.038 --> 11:46.624
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

11:46.707 --> 11:48.000
You're like...

11:48.084 --> 11:49.335
I idolize you. Seriously.

11:49.418 --> 11:50.920
From a true fan. It's so nice to meet you.

11:51.003 --> 11:52.505
I'm Jack, by the way.

11:52.588 --> 11:54.006
Question. Did you get one of these?

11:55.049 --> 11:55.925
Yeah. Death.

11:56.801 --> 11:57.968
The High Priestess.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.303
I'm the Lover.

11:59.470 --> 12:00.513
Three minutes.

12:01.514 --> 12:02.598
Hermit.

12:02.807 --> 12:05.434
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

12:05.643 --> 12:07.061
- Why are we just...
- The door's locked.

12:07.144 --> 12:09.688
Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.

12:19.365 --> 12:21.158
What is this place?

12:25.496 --> 12:27.122
Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.966
Man, it's freezing in here.

12:38.634 --> 12:39.677
What's that?

12:39.885 --> 12:41.095
I don't know.

12:44.348 --> 12:45.349
What's it say?

12:46.600 --> 12:48.143
"Now you don't."

12:48.978 --> 12:52.273
"A rose by any other name..."

12:57.194 --> 12:59.405
Guys, what's happening?

13:01.073 --> 13:02.616
Look at that.

13:09.331 --> 13:10.457
It's gas!

13:10.666 --> 13:12.751
Relax. Just dry ice.

13:13.544 --> 13:14.545
Cool.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.006
Wait. What do you think this is all about?

13:17.089 --> 13:18.841
Hang on. Hang on.

13:23.679 --> 13:24.847
I got nothin'.

13:25.014 --> 13:26.765
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the delay.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.976
I'm just trying to create
the space for wisdom.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.603
Okay, so you're like Buddha,

13:30.686 --> 13:32.104
if he wasn't so enlightened.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.564
And you're like Jesus,

13:33.647 --> 13:36.191
if he was arrogant
and all of his miracles were fake.

13:36.275 --> 13:37.568
Okay, lovebirds, get a room.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.486
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

13:39.570 --> 13:40.696
No. Wait, did you?

13:40.821 --> 13:42.114
I Wish.

13:42.615 --> 13:44.867
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

13:45.868 --> 13:47.036
Oh, great.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.168
Electricity is out.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.795
Well, let's check.

14:13.646 --> 14:15.105
Blueprints.

14:15.940 --> 14:17.316
They're incredible.

14:18.776 --> 14:20.110
Who do you think did this?

14:20.277 --> 14:22.446
I don't know, but I really want to meet them.

14:24.406 --> 14:25.950
It's a show.

14:45.803 --> 14:47.221
<i>Merritt McKinney,</i>

14:48.973 --> 14:50.307
<i>Daniel Atlas,</i>

14:51.725 --> 14:52.977
<i>Henley Reeves,</i>

14:54.937 --> 14:56.647
<i>Jack Wilder.</i>

14:57.439 --> 15:01.360
<i>Arthur Tressler

15:04.113 --> 15:06.198
<i>The Four Horsemen.</i>

15:07.658 --> 15:09.076
Thank you.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.328
Tonight we would like to try something

15:11.453 --> 15:13.956
that will, well, set us a bit apart.

15:14.039 --> 15:15.541
For our final trick,

15:15.624 --> 15:17.584
we're gonna do something never before

15:17.668 --> 15:19.670
seen on a Las Vegas stage.

15:20.713 --> 15:23.048
Or any stage for that matter.

15:23.841 --> 15:25.676
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:27.636 --> 15:28.721
tonight

15:29.638 --> 15:31.765
we are going to rob a bank.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.486
That's a lot of excitement for a crime.

15:45.195 --> 15:48.866
I'm getting excited.
What about you, people?

15:54.371 --> 15:56.582
One, two, three!

16:05.299 --> 16:07.217
Sorry, sir.
There's absolutely no recording allowed

16:07.301 --> 16:08.552
during the performance.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.637
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

16:10.721 --> 16:11.805
Let me just put this away.

16:11.889 --> 16:13.182
Actually, I need to take that.

16:13.265 --> 16:15.726
After the show, I can come
and give it back to you.

16:16.435 --> 16:17.811
Okay.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.649
Okay, okay.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.735
Now, please, please, settle down.

16:25.486 --> 16:28.322
Now who here has a bank
they would like us to rob?

16:29.573 --> 16:31.575
That's a lot of people with a vendetta.

16:31.742 --> 16:33.452
So we'll choose one at random then.

16:35.079 --> 16:37.706
My associates will make sure
it's random. Right?

16:38.624 --> 16:40.959
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.712
In Jack's bowl
are ping pong balls with section numbers.

16:43.796 --> 16:45.798
Jack, could you hand me a section number?

16:46.006 --> 16:47.466
Thank you. We are looking at Section B.

16:47.549 --> 16:48.717
Where is Section B?

16:49.384 --> 16:51.887
Okay. There. It's gonna be
one of you guys. Get ready.

16:52.387 --> 16:53.722
I don't know why everybody's happy.

16:53.806 --> 16:54.848
It's only them.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.725
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

16:57.601 --> 16:58.685
Thank you, Merritt.

16:58.769 --> 17:00.562
We are looking at row number 5.

17:00.646 --> 17:01.772
Where is that?

17:01.855 --> 17:04.691
And Henley, could I please
have a random seat number?

17:05.567 --> 17:07.109
Oh. Lucky number 13.

17:07.361 --> 17:08.862
B-5-13. Where are you?

17:09.195 --> 17:12.825
Sir, please, stand up. There you are. Hi.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.078
Could you just confirm for me that this

17:16.161 --> 17:18.204
is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.289
Yes.

17:19.373 --> 17:21.375
Okay. Wonderful.
Now, could you please tell us

17:21.458 --> 17:22.792
your name and the name of your bank?

17:23.001 --> 17:25.212
Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

17:25.462 --> 17:28.799
And my bank,
it's Credit Republicain de Paris.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.175
French. Okay.

17:30.384 --> 17:31.927
We were hoping for something
a little more local,

17:32.010 --> 17:34.263
a kind of mom-and-pop
credit union with no security.

17:34.346 --> 17:36.390
But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

17:36.473 --> 17:37.724
Could you please come up to the stage

17:37.808 --> 17:39.059
and we'll rob your bank.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.270
And while he does that...

17:41.353 --> 17:42.646
There is someone here tonight

17:42.729 --> 17:44.481
without whom we would just be

17:44.565 --> 17:46.567
four magicians working the circuit,

17:46.650 --> 17:47.651
trying to get...

17:47.860 --> 17:49.236
Well, actually, trying to get here.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.612
You probably know this man,

17:50.696 --> 17:52.197
if not from one of the many, many

17:52.322 --> 17:53.574
companies he puts his name on.

17:53.657 --> 17:55.742
He is our friend. He is our benefactor.

17:55.826 --> 17:57.160
Mr. Arthur Tressler.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.329
Please, stand up, Art. Please, stand up.

17:59.413 --> 18:00.414
The only man here with

18:00.497 --> 18:02.624
the Queen's cell phone number.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.168
Actually, please, stay standing, Art.

18:06.169 --> 18:08.422
I want to say that
when we came to Mr. Tressler,

18:08.505 --> 18:10.883
we promised that, as a unit,
we could become

18:11.008 --> 18:12.092
the biggest name in magic.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.594
So we wanted to say, "Thank you."

18:13.677 --> 18:15.679
And by the way, Art,
you notice on the sign out front,

18:15.762 --> 18:17.848
we made sure we put your name on top.

18:18.015 --> 18:20.100
If you turn out to be as good

18:20.183 --> 18:22.019
as you think you are, dear girl,

18:22.185 --> 18:24.271
that won't be necessary much longer.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.772
We haven't done our closer yet.

18:25.856 --> 18:27.024
Why don't you watch it

18:27.107 --> 18:28.442
and then you can decide for yourself.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.986
Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Tressler!

18:31.069 --> 18:32.446
Thank you. And, of course, once again,

18:32.529 --> 18:34.573
the Cardinal of Clairvoyance,
Merritt McKinney.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.035
Etienne, what Jack
is bringing to the stage now,

18:38.243 --> 18:41.872
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet.

18:42.039 --> 18:44.124
You will need to wear this,
as it will allow you

18:44.374 --> 18:48.128
to literally fold through space and time

18:48.378 --> 18:50.547
to your bank in the...

18:50.714 --> 18:51.757
8th?

18:51.965 --> 18:53.884
-9th arrondissement.
- Yeah.

18:54.051 --> 18:55.886
Now, once you are there,

18:55.969 --> 18:58.055
we will be able to speak
with you through this helmet.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.890
NOW if...

19:00.098 --> 19:01.850
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

19:01.934 --> 19:04.144
It has the added attraction
of being very stylish.

19:04.269 --> 19:07.981
It's about time the French learned
from America on that subject.

19:09.608 --> 19:10.734
Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

19:10.817 --> 19:12.402
- Thank you. Thank you...
-it is.

19:13.487 --> 19:16.073
Thank you. Thank you very much.

19:17.449 --> 19:18.784
But before you go anywhere,

19:18.909 --> 19:20.911
could you please, pick a card, any card.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.245
Not that card.

19:22.454 --> 19:25.749
No, that's an old American joke.
You can take that one.

19:25.958 --> 19:27.417
Okay. This one?

19:27.584 --> 19:29.586
Show it to your friends in Section B.
But not to us.

19:31.254 --> 19:33.298
Okay, great. Now if you could
just sign your name there.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.842
- Yes.
- In English, if possible.

19:36.259 --> 19:37.678
- That's good.
- Thanks.

19:38.804 --> 19:39.930
Put it in your pocket.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.683
And now for one tiny detail.

20:00.117 --> 20:04.663
Now, Etienne, let's step into
this cockamamie contraption.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.124
<i>And</i> I'll <i>step off of it. Bonne chance.</i>

20:07.207 --> 20:09.960
It's 11:50 p.m. here in Vegas.

20:10.168 --> 20:12.295
That's 8:50 a.m. in Paris.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.840
Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.049
One,

20:16.133 --> 20:17.217
two...

20:17.300 --> 20:18.343
Three.

20:21.638 --> 20:22.806
What the fuck?

20:23.015 --> 20:24.641
- Efienne?
- Efienne?

20:24.808 --> 20:26.768
It wasn't supposed to happen
like that, was it?

20:26.852 --> 20:28.103
Efienne?

20:28.478 --> 20:30.480
I liked that little French guy.

20:30.689 --> 20:31.732
Where did he go?

20:40.699 --> 20:42.242
Wait, there he is.

20:44.536 --> 20:46.580
No, no, no, no, please, please, please.

20:46.830 --> 20:49.499
This is Daniel Atlas. Can you hear me?

20:49.583 --> 20:50.834
Etienne? Are you okay?

20:50.917 --> 20:52.002
<i>Yes.</i>

20:52.085 --> 20:54.463
Perfect. What do you see in there?

20:56.423 --> 20:57.507
Money.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.134
Is this real?

20:59.217 --> 21:01.720
Yes. Looks like three million
or so Euros' worth.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.515
Okay, now, here's what
we're gonna need you to do.

21:05.599 --> 21:07.559
<i>I want you to take the card that you signed</i>

21:07.642 --> 21:08.894
<i>out of your pocket.</i>

21:09.352 --> 21:10.437
And I want you to take the ticket stub

21:10.520 --> 21:11.563
from tonight's show

21:11.772 --> 21:12.814
<i>and I want you to put it right there</i>

21:12.898 --> 21:14.941
<i>in the middle of the money.</i>

21:18.028 --> 21:19.196
Now drop it.

21:31.249 --> 21:34.461
Now, on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button.

21:34.544 --> 21:35.879
Don't press it just yet.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.714
<i>That button activates an air duct</i>

21:37.798 --> 21:40.550
that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.052
<i>Okay, good. Now you can press it.</i>

21:42.260 --> 21:44.387
All right, now, Etienne, hold on tight.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.847
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.296
Wait a second.

23:12.017 --> 23:14.269
Thank you, Etienne. Thank you, everyone!

23:14.352 --> 23:15.520
We are The Four Horsemen.

23:15.604 --> 23:16.730
And good night!

23:16.813 --> 23:18.398
Good night!

23:30.744 --> 23:31.953
Hold up here.

23:32.329 --> 23:33.914
Dylan Rhodes.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.542
What? I don't think I heard you correctly.

23:37.626 --> 23:39.085
Did you say magicians?

23:39.169 --> 23:41.087
Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

23:41.171 --> 23:42.380
<i>Where are you now?</i>

23:42.464 --> 23:44.466
I'm at Aria. I'm heading
up there to grab 'em now.

23:48.678 --> 23:50.597
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.057
Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.143
Let's go. Get 'em up.

23:55.352 --> 23:56.645
Put the book down.

23:56.853 --> 23:58.605
Okay. You got me.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.190
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- Oh, my!

24:00.690 --> 24:03.443
Do one of you guys
mind giving us a hand with our bags?

24:03.985 --> 24:05.028
Let's go.

24:22.879 --> 24:24.839
<i>Boss, please tell me this is a joke.</i>

24:24.923 --> 24:27.968
<i>I just got Willy Mears
to finger Paulie Attanasio.</i>

24:28.051 --> 24:29.761
I'm a month, two tops,

24:29.844 --> 24:31.304
away from blowing this whole thing open.

24:31.388 --> 24:32.430
Get Turkelson.

24:32.514 --> 24:33.640
He's in Atlantic City.

24:33.723 --> 24:34.975
What about Cowan? Look at him.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.476
He's just sitting there on his ass.

24:36.559 --> 24:37.769
Hilarious, Rhodes.

24:38.228 --> 24:39.354
I love you.

24:39.688 --> 24:40.730
Asshole.

24:40.939 --> 24:42.482
I don't have time for this magic crap.

24:42.565 --> 24:45.110
This crap just pulled
three million Euro out of a Parisian bank.

24:45.193 --> 24:46.361
- That's how much they got?
- Yeah.

24:46.444 --> 24:47.946
Actually, 3.2.

24:51.616 --> 24:52.617
Who is she?

24:53.618 --> 24:54.619
Who are you?

24:54.703 --> 24:56.371
Alma Dray from Interpol.

24:56.538 --> 24:57.998
I'll be working the investigation with you.

24:58.081 --> 24:59.291
You gotta be kidding me.

24:59.374 --> 25:00.917
It's bad enough they got me chasing down

25:01.042 --> 25:02.168
David Copperfield and Friends.

25:02.252 --> 25:05.463
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with Interpol?

25:05.547 --> 25:07.799
I look forward to working
with you, too, Agent Rhodes.

25:07.882 --> 25:10.844
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

25:10.927 --> 25:13.471
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

25:13.555 --> 25:16.099
Oh, you did? You spoke
to my witness before me?

25:16.182 --> 25:19.311
Your witness? I thought
you didn't want the case.

25:19.394 --> 25:20.937
Besides, he's useless.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.814
Oh, really? Why is that?

25:22.897 --> 25:25.150
Because he believes their magic was real.

25:25.233 --> 25:26.901
Oh, he believes the magic was real?

25:26.985 --> 25:28.445
You're right, he probably is useless.

25:28.528 --> 25:31.865
Is it okay with Interpol if we talk to him, too?

25:31.948 --> 25:33.533
Thank you.

25:34.159 --> 25:37.329
I have never stolen a thing in my life, okay?

25:37.412 --> 25:39.789
I tried to give
the money back, but they won't take it.

25:39.873 --> 25:42.334
Okay, okay, okay,
let's just say you robbed a bank.

25:42.417 --> 25:44.961
- I did.
- Fine. Fantastic. You did.

25:45.045 --> 25:47.589
But since I'm new to this,
can you explain to me how you went

25:47.672 --> 25:50.091
from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

25:50.550 --> 25:52.302
With the teleportation helmet.

25:52.761 --> 25:54.429
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

25:54.512 --> 25:56.389
He was hypnotized during the show.

25:56.473 --> 25:58.308
I told you, he's useless.

25:58.391 --> 25:59.517
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm clone

25:59.601 --> 26:01.144
with this other bullshit.

26:04.731 --> 26:05.690
Hey!

26:05.774 --> 26:07.442
During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

26:07.525 --> 26:08.818
to believe they were in the Philharmonic.

26:08.902 --> 26:11.196
I guess that "bullshit" was the trigger word.

26:11.279 --> 26:14.741
Okay. Hey, hey. Ecoutez.
Etienne, come on down from there.

26:14.824 --> 26:16.117
You're not in the Philharmonic.

26:16.201 --> 26:18.620
- How do you say "stop" in French?
- Stop.

26:18.703 --> 26:19.746
Tell him to stop.

26:19.829 --> 26:24.084
No, I can't. You just have to
let him finish his movement.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.252
Okay, I need a time-out.

26:26.336 --> 26:27.837
Too many French people in one room.

26:27.962 --> 26:29.464
Agent Rhodes!

26:29.547 --> 26:32.258
I'm ordered by my bosses
to provide a report.

26:32.342 --> 26:35.387
And until we have one,
I'm here, like it or not.

26:35.470 --> 26:37.055
So we can work together,

26:37.222 --> 26:39.140
or you can continue to follow behind

26:39.224 --> 26:41.351
asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

26:41.476 --> 26:42.644
It's up to you.

26:46.481 --> 26:47.899
I'm not finished.

26:47.982 --> 26:51.778
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

26:51.861 --> 26:54.197
And I do not handle jet lag well.

26:57.325 --> 26:59.702
So if you want to see who can be grumpier,

26:59.828 --> 27:01.913
I promise you, you will lose.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.625
Fine. So which one of these idiots

27:05.708 --> 27:07.127
do you want to talk to first?

27:07.210 --> 27:08.253
Him?

27:13.800 --> 27:14.926
Dylan, for the record,

27:15.009 --> 27:17.137
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.263
Okay.

27:18.346 --> 27:19.681
That is to say, that it's not a science.

27:19.848 --> 27:21.099
It's more for entertainment.

27:21.182 --> 27:22.434
All right.

27:22.517 --> 27:25.895
Just don't believe
everything the guy says. That's all.

27:26.855 --> 27:29.691
Please convey my deepest apologies

27:29.816 --> 27:31.568
to your colleague out there.

27:31.651 --> 27:34.028
I'm really sorry about this
whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

27:34.112 --> 27:35.280
I was out of line.

27:35.363 --> 27:36.614
Tranny Tuesday?

27:36.698 --> 27:38.366
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.201
Or might not have, if you believe

27:40.326 --> 27:42.745
everything Agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.457
But isn't there a proud tradition in the FBI

27:45.540 --> 27:47.417
of men wearing dresses?

27:48.126 --> 27:51.838
<i>No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.</i>

27:54.924 --> 27:56.509
I'm just having fun.

27:56.593 --> 27:58.928
Was this your card? No.

27:59.012 --> 28:00.305
See, I knew you weren't
a queen of hearts lady,

28:00.388 --> 28:01.389
and I respect that.

28:01.473 --> 28:03.349
The trick usually works better
when I'm not strapped in here,

28:03.433 --> 28:04.476
but I understand protocol.

28:04.559 --> 28:05.894
Okay, okay.

28:05.977 --> 28:08.563
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

28:08.646 --> 28:11.232
then how did
the playing card get into the vault?

28:11.316 --> 28:12.317
Oh, yes. That would be...

28:12.400 --> 28:13.902
What do the kids call it these days?

28:14.027 --> 28:15.153
Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

28:15.236 --> 28:17.238
Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

28:17.322 --> 28:19.908
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

28:20.909 --> 28:22.869
You can keep that. Don't share it with him.

28:23.077 --> 28:26.080
It says here you are a mentalist.

28:26.706 --> 28:29.334
What exactly is mentalism?

28:29.417 --> 28:32.378
Tricks, mostly. Some science.

28:32.587 --> 28:36.424
Targeted guessing
might be a most apt description.

28:36.591 --> 28:39.844
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

28:41.513 --> 28:43.181
Voices in my head.

28:44.432 --> 28:47.435
Says here you were
fairly famous at one point.

28:47.519 --> 28:49.521
You can
even hypnotize people over the phone.

28:49.604 --> 28:52.106
Some big tours
around the U.S. for a few years,

28:52.190 --> 28:54.192
-two TV specials.
- Glory days.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.862
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

28:57.946 --> 28:59.280
Did your research, did you?

28:59.364 --> 29:01.199
IRS audit. Back taxes.

29:01.282 --> 29:03.034
You've had a long hard slog back

29:03.117 --> 29:05.537
into the limelight,
haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

29:05.620 --> 29:10.291
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down Memory Lane.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.460
As far as I understand it,
when the man from Paris

29:12.544 --> 29:13.711
put on the magical helmet...

29:13.795 --> 29:14.796
Listen to me.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.465
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

29:17.549 --> 29:18.675
Which makes you an accomplice.

29:18.758 --> 29:21.177
So if you wanna walk out of here
today, I'd suggest you start...

29:21.261 --> 29:22.303
Now you listen to me, unless you think

29:22.387 --> 29:23.805
there's a D.A. in the state of Nevada

29:23.888 --> 29:25.348
who'd be willing
to make sense of this to a jury,

29:25.431 --> 29:26.599
then we have a show to perform.

29:26.808 --> 29:27.850
And you, Agent Rhodes,

29:27.934 --> 29:29.269
have a drawing board to get back to.

29:29.352 --> 29:30.812
Is this your first date?

29:31.896 --> 29:33.022
What?

29:33.106 --> 29:36.901
No, I mean, obviously, you guys don't
know each other well, if at all.

29:36.985 --> 29:40.488
But, like,
there is a palpable tension in this room.

29:40.572 --> 29:42.407
And before you get involved,

29:42.490 --> 29:45.994
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets.

29:46.119 --> 29:47.787
And I know the first one is that

29:47.870 --> 29:50.999
this is your first time off the desk. Isn't it?

29:51.416 --> 29:52.875
You should have said something to him.

29:52.959 --> 29:55.128
This is a weird way for you to find out.

29:55.211 --> 29:57.046
You are literally
begging to be arrested. You know that?

29:57.171 --> 29:59.507
If it means you would
actually do it, then, yeah. But you won't.

29:59.591 --> 30:01.050
Because if you did, it means that you,

30:01.134 --> 30:03.219
and the FBI, and your friends at Interpol,

30:03.303 --> 30:06.764
actually believe,
at an institutional level, in magic.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.475
The press would have a field day.

30:09.684 --> 30:11.477
And we'd be even more famous
than we already are.

30:11.561 --> 30:12.812
And you guys would look like idiots

30:12.895 --> 30:14.188
even more then you already are.

30:14.272 --> 30:17.775
Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

30:17.859 --> 30:19.527
You have,
what we in the business, like to call,

30:19.611 --> 30:21.029
"nothing up your sleeve."

30:21.195 --> 30:22.280
And you know it.

30:22.363 --> 30:24.449
Don't draw him in and then dump him

30:24.616 --> 30:27.994
because abandonment
is a big "area" for him.

30:28.536 --> 30:29.662
Mommy?

30:30.371 --> 30:31.581
Daddy.

30:31.914 --> 30:33.374
You have big daddy issues.

30:33.458 --> 30:35.001
- Okay, that's enough.
<i>- I'll</i> tell you what.

30:35.084 --> 30:38.379
Your average therapist is gonna charge you
$200-$300 for this sesh.

30:38.463 --> 30:40.757
Me? I'll take a tenner.

30:41.299 --> 30:44.385
Okay, later, if you're feeling magnanimous,

30:44.469 --> 30:46.387
I'll still take a tenner.

30:46.638 --> 30:48.681
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

30:48.806 --> 30:50.892
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.518
And you know who put them there?

30:52.602 --> 30:54.520
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

30:54.604 --> 30:58.566
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

30:58.650 --> 31:01.486
than you can maintain
that phony arrogance.

31:01.569 --> 31:03.696
And the instant that you even show

31:03.780 --> 31:06.449
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

31:06.532 --> 31:07.825
I'll be there.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.494
I will be all over you like...

31:09.577 --> 31:10.745
Like white on rice?

31:11.037 --> 31:12.538
Sorry. That's unfair.

31:12.705 --> 31:13.706
Let me warn you.

31:13.873 --> 31:14.916
I want you to follow.

31:15.124 --> 31:16.459
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

31:16.542 --> 31:18.086
we will always be one step, three steps,

31:18.169 --> 31:19.212
seven steps ahead of you.

31:19.295 --> 31:20.505
And just when you think you're catching up,

31:20.588 --> 31:21.964
that's when we'll be right behind you.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.508
And at no time will you be
anywhere other than

31:23.591 --> 31:24.676
exactly where I want you to be.

31:24.759 --> 31:26.386
So come close. Get all over me

31:26.469 --> 31:27.804
because the closer you think you are,

31:27.887 --> 31:29.263
the less you'll actually see.

31:29.347 --> 31:30.348
I'm gonna nail you...

31:34.811 --> 31:37.146
Something wrong with that soda, Miss?

31:45.446 --> 31:46.698
Oh! Shit!

31:47.281 --> 31:48.783
First rule of magic.

31:49.617 --> 31:51.869
Always be the smartest guy in the room.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.853
Boss, what are we doing?
We're letting them go?

32:17.061 --> 32:19.105
They all but admitted
they're gonna do it again.

32:19.188 --> 32:21.232
About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

32:21.315 --> 32:23.067
- What changed?
- I met them.

32:23.151 --> 32:24.152
Hey. Guys.

32:24.485 --> 32:26.946
Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

32:27.029 --> 32:28.156
Most of it was just filler.

32:28.239 --> 32:29.907
People that Tressler
dragged in to pack the room.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.784
But guess who was sitting there in the back,

32:31.868 --> 32:33.035
filming the whole damn thing?

32:33.161 --> 32:34.162
I don't know.

32:34.245 --> 32:35.705
Thaddeus Bradley.

32:38.249 --> 32:40.418
Thaddeus Bradley,
the guy from TV with the DVDs and shows?

32:40.501 --> 32:41.502
No.

32:41.586 --> 32:43.921
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.840
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

32:45.923 --> 32:47.008
Get him on the phone.

32:47.091 --> 32:48.760
I did. You're having lunch with him in 45.

32:48.843 --> 32:49.886
Good.

32:50.052 --> 32:52.722
<i>Mr. Bradley started as a magician.</i>

32:52.805 --> 32:54.515
- He was actually quite good.
- Really?

32:54.849 --> 32:56.976
- One of the best.
- You don't say.

32:58.311 --> 33:01.189
"The greatest genius
is in seeing through the illusion."

33:01.272 --> 33:03.691
That's a man who loves his work.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.944
You sure I can't interest you
in a glass of wine?

33:07.028 --> 33:09.864
No, no, no. No, thank you, sir.
We're working.

33:10.323 --> 33:11.491
I will take one.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.585
That's incredible. That's amazing.

33:24.212 --> 33:25.379
Red dye, palmed.

33:25.463 --> 33:28.132
Is that how Jesus did it? That's incredible.

33:28.216 --> 33:29.550
I'm sorry. Can I just take a minute here?

33:29.634 --> 33:31.928
You were one of the great magicians.
Why did you stop?

33:32.553 --> 33:35.223
Do you know how many people went
to see magic performed live

33:35.306 --> 33:36.891
in the last half decade?

33:36.974 --> 33:38.226
About 1.6 million.

33:38.309 --> 33:41.646
You know how many DVDs I sold
in the same period?

33:41.729 --> 33:43.022
Five million.

33:43.105 --> 33:44.148
Right, so it's about the money.

33:44.232 --> 33:45.733
Well, the money is only there

33:45.817 --> 33:49.070
because the need to know
is greater than the desire to be fooled.

33:49.153 --> 33:53.449
Like you, I detest those
who prey upon the gullibility of the masses.

33:53.533 --> 33:57.203
With all due respect,
isn't there a cost, though, to this game?

33:57.745 --> 33:58.788
Cost?

33:58.871 --> 34:00.164
I don't know. Careers.

34:00.248 --> 34:01.374
Lives.

34:01.457 --> 34:04.669
I assume you're referring to Lionel Shrike.

34:05.127 --> 34:06.963
I'm sorry, who?

34:07.046 --> 34:08.547
Lionel Shrike.

34:08.630 --> 34:13.010
A middling magician who drowned
in the Hudson River 30 years ago.

34:13.094 --> 34:16.848
On Mr. Bradley's first special,
he revealed all of Shrike's tricks.

34:16.931 --> 34:20.393
The next year,
Shrike tried to stage a comeback.

34:20.476 --> 34:21.936
He was shackled inside a safe,

34:22.018 --> 34:23.813
and dropped into the river.

34:23.896 --> 34:25.022
But he never resurfaced.

34:25.106 --> 34:27.358
You mean he died?

34:27.440 --> 34:29.235
I didn't kill him.

34:29.318 --> 34:33.572
He killed himself trying to do something
he wasn't prepared to handle.

34:33.656 --> 34:35.867
You do realize this is a game?

34:35.949 --> 34:37.743
Believe me, it's not a game.

34:37.827 --> 34:38.995
It is a game.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.830
You're the game. You're being played.

34:40.913 --> 34:44.375
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust...

34:44.458 --> 34:46.210
I mean, come on.

34:46.293 --> 34:47.295
You got me.

34:47.378 --> 34:48.629
If you really want to know

34:48.713 --> 34:52.507
how a bank in Paris was robbed
from a stage in Las Vegas,

34:52.592 --> 34:54.552
my special comes out next month.

34:54.635 --> 34:55.761
Or I could just bring you in

34:55.844 --> 34:58.306
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me.

34:58.389 --> 34:59.932
Unless, of course,
what you're trying to say to me is that

35:00.016 --> 35:03.102
you actually don't know how they did it.

35:05.104 --> 35:07.273
Showmanship and theatrics.

35:07.481 --> 35:09.609
When a magician waves his hand and says,

35:09.734 --> 35:11.319
"This is where the magic is happening."

35:11.569 --> 35:13.988
The real trick is happening somewhere else.

35:14.488 --> 35:17.450
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

35:17.658 --> 35:19.910
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

35:20.119 --> 35:21.621
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

35:21.787 --> 35:24.498
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

35:24.749 --> 35:26.000
But don't take my word for it.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.169
How about a trip to Paris?

35:28.628 --> 35:31.756
Hermia,
the teleportation helmet, please, darling?

35:32.298 --> 35:33.591
You're joking, right?

35:33.799 --> 35:36.052
You wanna know how they did it or not?

35:36.761 --> 35:39.430
I'm just gonna put this on your head.

35:40.139 --> 35:41.474
Step right up.

35:42.767 --> 35:44.435
There you go.

35:45.102 --> 35:48.773
Now we just pull this down
all safe and snug.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.735
Make yourself comfortable. There we go.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.945
And when you're ready to go to Paris,

35:55.029 --> 35:57.114
just say the magic word.

35:57.448 --> 35:58.616
Blow me?

35:59.617 --> 36:01.369
<i>- That'll suffice.
- Bon voyage.</i>

36:13.381 --> 36:16.509
I personally prefer to take the stairs to Paris.

36:17.176 --> 36:19.136
Welcome to the City of Light, Agent Rhodes.

36:19.303 --> 36:21.097
Hardy har har. What was with the helmet?

36:21.472 --> 36:22.682
My fun.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.267
What?

36:25.351 --> 36:26.727
Nothing.

36:28.479 --> 36:29.647
So they got a vault set.

36:29.730 --> 36:30.815
Yes.

36:30.898 --> 36:31.982
And it's the exact replica

36:32.149 --> 36:33.234
of the little French guy's bank.

36:33.317 --> 36:34.360
So he's a plant.

36:34.443 --> 36:35.903
He was a dupe, not a plant.

36:35.986 --> 36:38.155
They chose him. They knew
which seat he was in.

36:38.614 --> 36:40.825
No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

36:41.659 --> 36:44.412
Unless, of course,
the audience didn't pick the seat.

36:44.495 --> 36:46.580
They let them think they picked the seat.

36:46.664 --> 36:48.040
We'll choose one at random then.

36:48.541 --> 36:50.418
<i>Actually, they were just palming the ball</i>

36:50.501 --> 36:52.211
<i>with the seat number they wanted.</i>

36:52.670 --> 36:54.505
We are looking at row number 5.

36:54.672 --> 36:56.006
Henley, could I please
have a seat number?

36:56.507 --> 36:57.508
Lucky number 13.

36:57.591 --> 36:59.635
Could you just confirm that this
is, in fact, your seat?

36:59.719 --> 37:01.303
<i>He was selected.</i>

37:02.054 --> 37:04.098
<i>They programmed his mind
to make him go to Las Vegas.</i>

37:04.181 --> 37:05.349
Viva Las Vegas.

37:06.434 --> 37:09.478
<i>And then
they kept reinforcing it, until he did.</i>

37:10.688 --> 37:11.939
<i>They trailed him.</i>

37:12.022 --> 37:13.149
<i>They studied him.</i>

37:13.232 --> 37:14.984
<i>Nothing was left to chance.</i>

37:17.278 --> 37:18.279
I got his measurements.

37:18.362 --> 37:20.740
<i>He had no idea he was their target.</i>

37:20.865 --> 37:22.992
<i>And they simply activated him in Vegas.</i>

37:23.159 --> 37:24.368
When I snap my fingers...

37:24.577 --> 37:27.037
And once again, Merritt McKinney.

37:27.163 --> 37:28.247
<i>But how did they know what bank was his?</i>

37:28.581 --> 37:29.707
- You're kidding.
- Really?

37:29.915 --> 37:32.460
Can you be any more
of a condescending ass?

37:32.543 --> 37:33.544
Yes.

37:34.336 --> 37:35.337
Like this.

37:36.505 --> 37:39.800
There's a very rare, very mysterious way

37:39.884 --> 37:43.387
in which a magician divines
an audience member's bank.

37:44.388 --> 37:45.389
You ready?

37:45.806 --> 37:46.807
Yes.

37:47.725 --> 37:49.101
Credit card.

37:49.477 --> 37:52.313
And that's how they got
the signature for the card

37:52.396 --> 37:54.356
they left in the vault in Paris.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.441
Very good.

37:55.691 --> 37:57.151
You're being one-upped, Agent Rhodes.

37:57.443 --> 38:00.279
Okay, but they had to get
the signature card in the vault.

38:00.404 --> 38:01.906
You said they didn't steal the money.

38:02.156 --> 38:03.657
No, I didn't say they didn't steal the money.

38:03.741 --> 38:05.201
I said they didn't rob the bank.

38:06.368 --> 38:08.329
<i>My guess is that they targeted</i>

38:08.412 --> 38:10.080
<i>a shipment of freshly minted money</i>

38:10.164 --> 38:14.084
<i>headed to the Frenchman's bank
on-board an armored truck.</i>

38:15.503 --> 38:18.297
<i>Which, of course,
is just as hard to break into.</i>

38:18.422 --> 38:21.050
<i>Unless you're already inside.</i>

38:40.611 --> 38:43.656
<i>And despite what the banks
would have you believe,</i>

38:43.739 --> 38:46.575
<i>the men who drive
these trucks are not exactly mental giants.</i>

38:48.285 --> 38:49.829
<i>For our Horsemen,</i>

38:49.912 --> 38:52.164
<i>it was almost too easy.</i>

38:58.462 --> 38:59.630
Hey, boys.

39:06.011 --> 39:09.598
So, how did they make the fake money
disappear from the vault? What is that?

39:10.015 --> 39:11.433
<i>Flash paper.</i>

39:13.686 --> 39:15.896
<i>Magicians use it all the time.</i>

39:21.068 --> 39:23.863
<i>Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.</i>

39:29.243 --> 39:31.620
<i>Two days ago, no one heard of these guys,</i>

39:31.787 --> 39:34.373
<i>but tonight's show sold out in 35 seconds.</i>

39:34.456 --> 39:36.917
I think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business.

39:37.001 --> 39:39.753
Give your audience $3 million.

39:39.962 --> 39:41.338
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

39:41.422 --> 39:42.631
Best finale ever.

39:42.715 --> 39:45.175
<i>They're gonna be
the first magicians in history to get laid.</i>

39:45.259 --> 39:47.720
<i>Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,</i>

39:47.803 --> 39:49.847
put it on the lawyer first. Remember.
- Oh, yes.

39:49.930 --> 39:52.266
<i>I always do. It's lawyer first,</i>

39:52.349 --> 39:54.393
<i>-then myself and then the children.
- Then yourself.</i>

39:54.476 --> 39:55.895
Yes. Then the children.

39:56.770 --> 39:59.440
Allow me to make plain
what we've both been thinking.

39:59.523 --> 40:00.691
And what's that?

40:00.774 --> 40:03.861
Well, obviously, you have feelings
of affection for Daniel.

40:03.944 --> 40:06.113
Unrequited and misguided,

40:06.196 --> 40:08.991
owing to his lack of emotional availability.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.744
Consequently, you're very tightly...

40:11.827 --> 40:13.454
How should I put it?

40:13.954 --> 40:14.955
Corked.

40:15.039 --> 40:16.040
Oh, lam?

40:16.123 --> 40:19.752
Now, recognizing that
you have physical needs not being met,

40:19.835 --> 40:22.463
and strictly in the vein of
helping a sister out,

40:22.546 --> 40:27.259
I invite you to think
of me as your own personal corkscrew.

40:27.468 --> 40:28.594
Wow. Thanks.

40:28.677 --> 40:31.430
Let me mull over
that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

40:31.513 --> 40:35.434
Cheap and meaningless, maybe,
but not time-consuming.

40:39.063 --> 40:41.065
<i>We should be getting there
a few minutes early.</i>

40:41.148 --> 40:42.232
<i>So, sit back, relax.</i>

40:42.316 --> 40:44.068
<i>We should be in the Big Easy soon.</i>

40:44.151 --> 40:45.861
<i>Appreciate you flying with us today.</i>

40:45.945 --> 40:48.405
So, what's in it
for Tressler, besides the money?

40:48.489 --> 40:49.573
Ego.

40:51.241 --> 40:52.993
Okay, pick your card.

40:53.494 --> 40:55.955
Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.

40:56.038 --> 40:57.873
No, don't tell me.

40:57.957 --> 40:59.750
-Okay.
-Okay.

40:59.833 --> 41:01.251
Thaddeus was there that night.

41:01.335 --> 41:03.754
He knows exactly
how they pulled it off. What about him?

41:03.837 --> 41:05.506
What are you saying?

41:05.589 --> 41:07.091
You think they could be working together.

41:07.174 --> 41:08.592
I don't know. All I know is that these guys

41:08.676 --> 41:10.135
were a bunch of street magicians

41:10.219 --> 41:11.762
a year ago with no resources.

41:11.845 --> 41:14.390
So, how do they go from doing that to this

41:14.473 --> 41:15.933
without some kind of outside help?

41:16.016 --> 41:17.434
Is this your card?

41:17.518 --> 41:20.938
No, my card is sitting
over there in that guy's lap.

41:21.563 --> 41:23.273
Nice shuffle.

41:23.357 --> 41:24.525
You know, this is hard.

41:24.608 --> 41:25.651
According to this book,

41:25.734 --> 41:29.780
some of those guys practice one simple
move eight hours a day for years.

41:29.863 --> 41:32.908
Really? Some of those guys
seriously need to get a life.

41:32.992 --> 41:35.244
Is it magicians, in general,
you have a problem with?

41:35.327 --> 41:37.579
Or specifically those guys?

41:38.330 --> 41:40.916
I could care less about magicians in general.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.836
What I hate is people
who exploit other people.

41:43.919 --> 41:45.045
Exploit them how?

41:45.129 --> 41:46.463
Try again.

41:47.589 --> 41:49.508
By taking advantage of their weaknesses.

41:49.591 --> 41:52.344
Their need
to believe in something that's unexplainable

41:52.428 --> 41:55.305
in order to make their lives more bearable.

41:55.514 --> 41:57.182
I see it as a strength.

41:57.266 --> 41:59.226
My life is happier when I believe that.

42:00.269 --> 42:01.645
Is this your card?

42:02.813 --> 42:03.939
Yeah.

42:04.773 --> 42:05.858
Yeah?

42:05.941 --> 42:07.484
- Yeah.
- Cool.

42:09.862 --> 42:13.240
That smile on your face. Is it real?

42:13.323 --> 42:14.575
Maybe.

42:15.034 --> 42:17.453
So let me ask you, Mr. Detective Man.

42:17.536 --> 42:18.954
Do you feel exploited?

42:19.038 --> 42:22.291
Or did you have maybe
a tiny, tiny bit of fun?

42:24.543 --> 42:25.794
Guy goes to the doctor.

42:25.878 --> 42:26.920
Doctor says, "Sir, you're gonna

42:27.004 --> 42:28.088
"have to stop masturbating."

42:28.172 --> 42:29.173
He Says, "Why?"

42:29.256 --> 42:30.716
He says, "So I can finish the examination."

42:30.799 --> 42:31.884
Oh, Danny, can I talk to you about

42:31.967 --> 42:33.510
-my role in the show real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

42:33.594 --> 42:34.845
Hey, guys.

42:35.304 --> 42:36.722
We got a show to prepare for.

42:36.805 --> 42:39.141
Do we now?

42:39.224 --> 42:40.267
No, no, no, don't do that.

42:40.350 --> 42:41.518
You're not doing that thing to me. No.

42:41.643 --> 42:42.936
What thing? I'm just looking at you.

42:43.020 --> 42:44.605
No, you're not.
I've been watching you for a year.

42:44.688 --> 42:46.065
I know all of your little tricks.

42:46.148 --> 42:47.316
That what they are to you? Tricks?

42:47.399 --> 42:49.109
Yes, it's gimmicks. it's Barnum statements.

42:49.193 --> 42:50.903
It's reading the eyes. Body language. I get it.

42:50.986 --> 42:52.654
If it's such an easy thing,
why don't you do Henley?

42:52.738 --> 42:54.490
Yeah, Danny. Why don't you do me?

42:54.573 --> 42:56.742
No, you're too easy. I'll do Jasmine.

42:56.825 --> 42:58.327
No.

42:58.660 --> 42:59.661
Do me.

42:59.745 --> 43:01.163
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Do Art.

43:01.246 --> 43:02.247
Okay.

43:02.372 --> 43:03.415
Even better.

43:03.499 --> 43:04.500
- Art.
- Yeah.

43:04.583 --> 43:06.376
But I warn you, I can be difficult to read,

43:06.460 --> 43:07.461
when I want to be.

43:07.544 --> 43:09.755
Just stay with me, okay?

43:10.380 --> 43:12.299
So, Art, you were a tough kid.

43:12.382 --> 43:14.426
You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

43:14.510 --> 43:16.428
You had a dog. A real tough dog.

43:16.512 --> 43:18.430
A brutish breed. Like a real...

43:18.514 --> 43:20.682
I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

43:20.766 --> 43:23.185
Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

43:23.268 --> 43:26.355
I had a fluffy white cat called Snuffles.

43:27.898 --> 43:29.191
Sorry.

43:29.358 --> 43:30.484
Wait, let me try one.

43:30.567 --> 43:31.652
- I can do way better than that.
- Let him do it.

43:31.735 --> 43:32.820
Come on, give me
one more time. One more time.

43:32.903 --> 43:34.488
He can do way better than that.

43:34.571 --> 43:35.572
Let's do family.

43:35.697 --> 43:38.867
You had an uncle on your mother's side.

43:39.034 --> 43:41.620
He had a real, kind of...
A real masculine name.

43:41.703 --> 43:43.956
A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...

43:44.039 --> 43:45.541
You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

43:45.624 --> 43:49.795
Like it was some kind of Paul.
Thompson? Was it a Paul...

43:49.962 --> 43:51.547
Okay. You know what? I got nothin'.

43:51.630 --> 43:53.132
- Nearly though.
- Was I?

43:53.215 --> 43:56.635
Yeah. My uncle's name
was Cushman Armitage.

43:56.802 --> 43:58.345
Really? Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?

43:58.428 --> 43:59.471
That was your childhood?

43:59.555 --> 44:01.932
I certainly hope
tonight's show is gonna be better than this.

44:02.808 --> 44:04.935
Don't worry. Just you wait.

44:10.232 --> 44:13.318
Hey. Come on, give me some good news
on a hotel room, please.

44:13.402 --> 44:14.528
<i>What, are you kidding me?</i>

44:14.611 --> 44:16.155
No, it's Mardi Gras, Dylan.

44:16.238 --> 44:18.157
There's nothing within sight of the theater.

44:18.240 --> 44:20.617
Hold on a second. Hold on.
Where is this woman?

44:22.494 --> 44:24.454
Hey, hey! There you are.

44:24.746 --> 44:26.123
What, the French girl
doing a little sightseeing

44:26.248 --> 44:27.249
while she's in New Orleans?

44:27.332 --> 44:29.543
No. In fact, here, speaking French

44:29.626 --> 44:31.336
is actually an asset.

44:31.420 --> 44:32.921
Do you see that woman up there?

44:33.964 --> 44:35.090
That's Marie Claire.

44:35.174 --> 44:37.426
And she has a lovely apartment for us.

44:39.761 --> 44:41.096
You're welcome.

44:41.430 --> 44:42.723
Yeah.

44:42.806 --> 44:44.433
We got a place.

44:46.393 --> 44:49.605
I want two each inside of here.
The other 30 around here.

44:49.688 --> 44:51.064
Roofs, alleys, balconies.

44:51.148 --> 44:54.234
- Eyes on The Horsemen at all times.
- Yes, sir.

44:54.318 --> 44:58.155
Wow, 100 years ago, William Robinson
took the name Chung Ling Soo

44:58.238 --> 45:02.117
and spent his entire life
never speaking English in public.

45:03.952 --> 45:05.787
This other guy, Maximillian...

45:05.996 --> 45:08.957
I am not interested in a history lesson
on magic at this moment.

45:09.416 --> 45:11.877
If you want to keep playing
into their hands, go for it.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.879
I'm just
trying to understand how they think.

45:13.962 --> 45:16.173
You think I'm playing
in their hands, do you?

45:16.256 --> 45:19.051
I don't know how any of that
is gonna go against this.

45:19.134 --> 45:21.303
This what? This magic?

45:22.763 --> 45:24.097
Lionel Shrike.

45:24.306 --> 45:27.851
In Central Park,
he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

45:27.935 --> 45:30.938
Then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years.

45:31.104 --> 45:32.522
They saw the tree in half.

45:32.606 --> 45:34.691
Inside the tree, encased in glass,

45:34.775 --> 45:36.610
is the card with the signature.

45:36.693 --> 45:37.819
How did he do that?

45:37.903 --> 45:41.239
I have no idea.
But I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

45:44.493 --> 45:45.911
You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

45:45.994 --> 45:47.579
<i>No, but I do have some good news.</i>

45:47.788 --> 45:49.748
Remember how Atlas is such a control freak,

45:49.831 --> 45:51.583
he's got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets?

45:51.667 --> 45:52.960
What tracking bracelets?

45:53.043 --> 45:54.294
<i>He has every member of his crew</i>

45:54.378 --> 45:55.963
<i>wearing a tracking bracelet.</i>

45:56.046 --> 45:58.131
<i>Those bracelets are on a sub-8 flat-band.</i>

45:58.215 --> 45:59.383
<i>So as long as Atlas is tracking them...</i>

45:59.466 --> 46:00.550
Next.

46:00.634 --> 46:01.718
...our boys can track Atlas

46:01.802 --> 46:03.220
from right here in the mobile command unit.

46:03.303 --> 46:05.263
<i>Okay, call me if you get any movement.</i>

46:05.347 --> 46:06.682
Copy that.

46:15.482 --> 46:17.859
You are missing the big picture here, Dylan.

46:19.194 --> 46:22.823
There is a place in Paris, Pont des Arts.

46:22.990 --> 46:26.827
Sometimes in the mornings
I sit on a bench there.

46:27.244 --> 46:28.870
And I watch the people make a wish

46:28.996 --> 46:31.081
and lock it in a lock on the bridge.

46:31.164 --> 46:33.834
Then throw the key into the Seine.

46:35.669 --> 46:40.257
All day they do this.
Mothers, lovers, old men.

46:40.507 --> 46:42.467
Watching the key sink into the water

46:42.551 --> 46:45.804
and their secret is locked away forever.

46:46.680 --> 46:51.018
Real and, at the same time, magical.

46:57.232 --> 46:58.358
So,

46:59.192 --> 47:02.863
do you really think it's possible
there's a fifth Horseman?

47:04.364 --> 47:05.615
Yeah.

47:12.039 --> 47:13.957
<i>There is a legend of a secret order</i>

47:14.041 --> 47:15.917
<i>born in ancient Egypt called</i>

47:16.376 --> 47:17.669
<i>"The Eye."</i>

47:19.379 --> 47:21.840
<i>It is said they perfected sleight of hand</i>

47:21.923 --> 47:24.009
<i>to steal food from the Pharaohs</i>

47:24.092 --> 47:25.886
<i>and give it to the slaves.</i>

47:26.261 --> 47:27.471
<i>Their purpose?</i>

47:27.554 --> 47:31.558
<i>Using magic
and illusion to even the scales of justice.</i>

47:32.434 --> 47:36.772
<i>Are The Horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth?</i>

47:37.147 --> 47:41.902
Will they evade the rules of law and logic
like they did in Las Vegas?

47:42.736 --> 47:46.990
Or will the dark mysticism
of this Southern swampland

47:47.574 --> 47:49.159
get the better of them?

47:55.582 --> 47:57.084
Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

47:57.250 --> 47:59.252
Either you have a cease-and-desist,

47:59.336 --> 48:01.630
which you don't, or you should leave.

48:01.838 --> 48:05.592
If I want something to cease or desist,

48:06.760 --> 48:07.928
it does.

48:08.136 --> 48:09.304
Take five.

48:09.638 --> 48:11.431
According to your potential backers,

48:11.640 --> 48:15.268
you stand to make 2.5 million tops

48:15.435 --> 48:16.978
from your best special.

48:17.187 --> 48:19.856
I have here a check

48:21.608 --> 48:22.859
for 3.5 million.

48:23.110 --> 48:24.111
To walk away?

48:24.277 --> 48:27.948
To fly away. My jet is at your disposal.

48:30.117 --> 48:32.786
Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

48:34.371 --> 48:36.456
You're in this to ride them up.

48:36.957 --> 48:38.959
I'm in it to ride them down.

48:39.292 --> 48:42.295
I take it that we do not have a deal.

48:43.797 --> 48:48.135
And therein lies our conflict.

48:51.555 --> 48:52.806
Let me be blunt.

48:53.223 --> 48:57.686
My bank account
is much, much bigger than yours.

48:57.894 --> 49:00.730
And my lawyers are much stronger.

49:01.064 --> 49:04.151
And they will manacle you

49:05.402 --> 49:07.237
with so many injunctions.

49:07.487 --> 49:09.739
Until you stand by, hopelessly watching

49:09.823 --> 49:12.492
everything that you own drain away

49:13.326 --> 49:15.829
in front of your greedy little eyes.

49:15.954 --> 49:18.165
This isn't the first time I've been threatened.

49:19.541 --> 49:21.042
And I'm still here.

49:21.126 --> 49:25.463
It is, however,
the first time you've been threatened by me.

49:26.339 --> 49:30.760
And if you do anything
to sully my investment,

49:30.844 --> 49:33.221
the ride down, which you mentioned,

49:33.305 --> 49:38.560
will be sudden, precipitous,
and measurable on the Richter scale.

49:40.187 --> 49:42.189
You shouldn't have done that.

49:43.523 --> 49:45.108
According to superstition,

49:45.317 --> 49:48.320
one who uses a doll
to enact one's own wrath,

49:48.403 --> 49:52.866
is likely to bring that
very wrath unto himself.

49:53.700 --> 49:55.202
Isn't that funny?

49:56.036 --> 49:58.038
And I thought you didn't believe in magic.

50:07.964 --> 50:09.049
Do me a favor.

50:09.132 --> 50:13.178
Visualize your most adventurous
sexualexpeï¬‚ence.

50:13.261 --> 50:14.304
Stay out of my head, you perv.

50:14.387 --> 50:18.099
Well, no, if I stay out of your head,
I'm never gonna get into your pants.

50:18.183 --> 50:20.185
- Right.
- So let's stick with this exercise.

50:20.268 --> 50:22.145
- And it helps...
- Pardon the intrusion.

50:22.229 --> 50:24.814
I just wanted to wish you good luck tonight.

50:24.898 --> 50:27.484
What, so you can try to expose us later
on your little website?

50:27.567 --> 50:28.777
And on demand.

50:28.860 --> 50:31.821
- That's not gonna happen.
- Oh, no?

50:31.905 --> 50:34.908
Operating on a special plane
because of The Eye?

50:35.617 --> 50:40.455
I heard it's a lovely place.
Lots of starshine and moonbeams.

50:40.538 --> 50:42.999
Make any magician's wish come true.

50:43.083 --> 50:44.501
You've come a long way,

50:44.584 --> 50:46.419
much further
than anyone would have expected

50:46.503 --> 50:48.505
<i>of a bunch of wanna-hes and has-beans.</i>

50:48.588 --> 50:52.759
If by "has-been" you're referring to me,
I just wanna say I'm flattered,

50:52.842 --> 50:56.221
because I always considered myself
a never-was.

50:56.304 --> 50:58.473
Do you mind if I do a quick read on you?

50:59.266 --> 51:00.267
By all means.

51:01.268 --> 51:05.939
Okay, I'm picturing a little boy.

51:06.022 --> 51:08.942
He wants to be a great magician someday.

51:09.025 --> 51:10.819
And though he's good,
he's not quite good enough.

51:10.902 --> 51:14.990
So he ends up at the bottom
of the entertainment food chain,

51:15.073 --> 51:18.660
feeding off of those
who have the talent that he never did.

51:18.743 --> 51:21.288
Tell me. Am I getting close?

51:23.957 --> 51:26.960
Wait. Before you go. I'm working
on something new. Do you have a second?

51:27.627 --> 51:30.463
Okay. Name a card.

51:30.547 --> 51:32.132
- King of hearts.
- Knew it.

51:32.215 --> 51:33.425
Okay.

51:40.640 --> 51:43.727
- It's up your left sleeve.
- Is it?

51:43.810 --> 51:45.562
No. No, I don't see it up there.

51:45.645 --> 51:49.357
You know, why don't you check
your unnecessary velveteen pocket there?

51:51.192 --> 51:52.193
Yeah.

51:55.655 --> 52:00.660
Anyway, thank you so much for coming by,
but this is kind of a talent only area, so...

52:01.911 --> 52:02.912
Break a leg.

52:02.996 --> 52:05.165
Hey, you break something, too.

52:05.248 --> 52:06.541
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

52:06.624 --> 52:08.335
<i>the Savoy management welcomes you</i>

52:08.418 --> 52:10.086
<i>to tonight's special performance,</i>

52:10.170 --> 52:12.922
<i>The Four Horsemen, Act Two.</i>

52:13.006 --> 52:15.050
<i>Unlike traditional performances,</i>

52:15.133 --> 52:17.302
<i>The Four Horsemen encourage you to film,</i>

52:17.385 --> 52:18.386
<i>call your friends,</i>

52:18.470 --> 52:21.556
<i>upload, stream, and tweet the show freely.</i>

52:21.639 --> 52:25.018
<i>Thank you. The show
will begin in a few minutes.</i>

52:28.980 --> 52:30.482
Nice watch.

52:31.649 --> 52:33.985
It's a family heirloom.

52:37.197 --> 52:39.908
By the way, I know how he did that trick.

52:39.991 --> 52:41.576
- Who?
- Shrike.

52:41.659 --> 52:43.912
So, when he was 14,

52:43.995 --> 52:46.164
he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

52:46.247 --> 52:49.918
He had a guy who worked at the carousel

52:50.001 --> 52:52.629
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

52:52.712 --> 52:53.880
And?

52:53.963 --> 52:58.134
At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

52:58.218 --> 53:01.471
Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,

53:01.554 --> 53:03.139
and presto!

53:03.223 --> 53:04.974
The card is in the tree.

53:05.058 --> 53:06.935
It was in the tree for 18 years.

53:07.018 --> 53:08.478
The card was in the tree.

53:08.561 --> 53:12.565
The tree grew around the card in 18 years.
I mean, that isn't magic. It's not magic.

53:12.649 --> 53:15.568
The point is, the trick
was not to look closely.

53:15.652 --> 53:17.654
It was to look so far

53:17.737 --> 53:20.532
that you see 20 years into the past.

53:20.615 --> 53:23.493
After Shrike drowned,
they never found the body.

53:23.576 --> 53:25.370
What are you suggesting?

53:28.998 --> 53:31.167
<i>Arthur Tressler presents</i>

53:31.251 --> 53:32.419
<i>Jack Wilder,</i>

53:32.502 --> 53:33.837
<i>Henley Reeves,</i>

53:33.920 --> 53:34.963
<i>Merritt McKinney,</i>

53:35.046 --> 53:36.714
<i>and Daniel Atlas.</i>

53:36.798 --> 53:38.758
<i>The Four Horsemen.</i>

53:43.930 --> 53:45.598
Thank you. Before we begin,

53:45.682 --> 53:47.725
we'd like to single out
two people in particular.

53:47.809 --> 53:50.270
A man and a woman to whom
we'd like to dedicate tonight's performance.

53:50.353 --> 53:52.188
FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes

53:52.272 --> 53:57.986
and the lovely, if somewhat inexperienced,
Interpol Agent Alma Dray, everyone.

53:58.903 --> 54:03.032
Yeah, Agent Rhodes has personally vowed
to "nail us."

54:03.116 --> 54:07.620
And we encourage him to do so
if he has the brains and the fur.

54:11.875 --> 54:14.043
What is magic?

54:14.127 --> 54:16.629
Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

54:18.339 --> 54:19.716
So I want you to look.

54:20.300 --> 54:22.343
Look as closely as possible.

54:22.760 --> 54:24.471
Because the tricks you are about to see

54:25.013 --> 54:26.723
may not seem connected.

54:26.806 --> 54:28.725
But we assure you, they are.

54:29.684 --> 54:32.479
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

54:32.812 --> 54:36.483
Or is it one giant illusion?

54:44.115 --> 54:47.118
And now for one
of the oldest tricks in the book.

54:47.243 --> 54:49.370
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

54:49.454 --> 54:51.706
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

54:51.915 --> 54:55.919
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

54:56.127 --> 54:58.379
I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

54:58.463 --> 55:01.299
and put her inside this mystery box.

55:01.716 --> 55:03.426
There are two pencils out there.

55:03.510 --> 55:04.761
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

55:04.844 --> 55:06.304
- Here!
- Yeah!

55:06.763 --> 55:08.723
And now, you will say the magic word.

55:08.806 --> 55:10.058
Abracadabra.

55:10.141 --> 55:11.518
Yes, and I will wave this magic wand

55:11.601 --> 55:13.186
for no reason. And then...

55:13.269 --> 55:15.688
Fluffy has
magically vanished before your very eyes.

55:17.023 --> 55:19.275
If you haven't experienced mass hypnosis,

55:19.359 --> 55:20.527
you're about to.

55:20.777 --> 55:21.861
And sleep.

55:21.945 --> 55:24.781
Down, down. Sleep, sleep.
Completely sleep.

55:24.864 --> 55:26.449
Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

55:26.533 --> 55:28.576
And now we are gonna debunk

55:28.660 --> 55:30.787
a few magic myths this evening.

55:30.870 --> 55:34.040
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

55:34.332 --> 55:36.876
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

55:36.960 --> 55:38.461
As has the mirror

55:38.545 --> 55:40.964
which makes the box only
appear as though it's empty.

55:41.047 --> 55:43.132
When you hear the word "freeze"

55:43.341 --> 55:45.552
you are all football players.

55:46.052 --> 55:48.555
And your job is to tackle,

55:48.721 --> 55:50.056
dismantle,

55:50.223 --> 55:51.391
crush,

55:51.641 --> 55:53.977
tear limb from limb,

55:54.352 --> 55:56.062
the quarterback.

55:57.438 --> 56:00.942
Now, we've all heard
of pulling the rabbit out of the hat.

56:01.025 --> 56:04.028
But has anyone heard
of pulling a hat out of a rabbit?

56:08.449 --> 56:10.910
You will know who the quarterback is.

56:10.994 --> 56:14.330
He will be the one saying that word.

56:14.414 --> 56:15.582
Freeze.

56:26.384 --> 56:28.386
Three, two, one...

56:35.768 --> 56:37.729
Put your hands in the middle.
One, two, three...

56:37.812 --> 56:39.230
Kill the quarterback!

56:39.314 --> 56:40.940
Get on back to your seats.

56:41.149 --> 56:43.276
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

57:15.725 --> 57:17.352
I guess you have lost some weight.

57:32.909 --> 57:34.077
At the intermission,

57:34.285 --> 57:36.621
we asked you to write down
your current bank balance,

57:36.829 --> 57:38.206
and seal it in an envelope.

57:38.289 --> 57:39.916
Now it's time to take those envelopes out.

57:39.999 --> 57:41.125
Everyone take 'em out.

57:42.543 --> 57:44.045
Now, everybody,

57:44.128 --> 57:47.090
shout out your name. All at once. Go.

57:48.800 --> 57:50.343
Shout 'em out.

57:52.428 --> 57:54.347
Clement? Frannick?

57:54.555 --> 57:56.599
- Yeah! Up here!
- Oh. Way up there.

57:56.682 --> 57:58.643
Okay. Dina? Robertson?

57:58.851 --> 58:00.228
That's me!

58:00.311 --> 58:02.647
Okay. Names. Names. Let's go.

58:04.023 --> 58:05.983
Josepha Hickey?

58:06.067 --> 58:07.068
That's me!

58:07.151 --> 58:10.071
Josepha, I want you
to focus on your balance,

58:10.196 --> 58:12.156
and count from one to 10 out loud.

58:12.365 --> 58:13.991
One, two, three, four, five...

58:14.075 --> 58:15.326
Stop.

58:15.618 --> 58:17.370
Is the first digit 5?

58:17.453 --> 58:18.413
Yes.

58:18.496 --> 58:19.831
Do it again. This time, faster.

58:19.914 --> 58:21.332
One, two, three, four, five, six...

58:21.416 --> 58:22.500
Stop.

58:23.209 --> 58:24.710
Six. Again.

58:24.794 --> 58:25.795
One, two...

58:26.003 --> 58:29.966
Josepha, is your
bank balance $562 as of today?

58:30.174 --> 58:32.343
Yeah. That's what I got.

58:34.095 --> 58:35.638
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

58:35.805 --> 58:36.848
Okay, Dina,

58:38.766 --> 58:39.809
1 ,

58:40.393 --> 58:41.436
<i>4.</i>

58:42.145 --> 58:43.146
<i>7.</i>

58:44.105 --> 58:45.731
-7.
- Yeah.

58:45.815 --> 58:49.569
You think it is.
But in fact, you, too, are wrong.

58:49.652 --> 58:50.820
Clement.

58:50.903 --> 58:53.865
You do not have $6,500 in your account.

58:54.073 --> 58:57.869
In fact, everybody stand up. Everybody.

58:59.871 --> 59:02.665
Yeah. Put your envelopes to your forehead.

59:04.167 --> 59:05.626
Focus on your number.

59:09.881 --> 59:12.967
This is... Oh, dear. Just as I feared.

59:13.092 --> 59:15.261
Oh, this is strange.

59:15.678 --> 59:18.848
You know, I hate to say this,
but you're all wrong.

59:19.056 --> 59:20.892
Every last one of you is dead wrong

59:20.975 --> 59:23.102
about what you think is in your account.

59:23.186 --> 59:24.604
Okay, you can sit down now.

59:25.229 --> 59:27.523
Yeah. I almost forgot.

59:27.648 --> 59:30.526
This evening would not be possible

59:30.610 --> 59:34.113
if it weren't
for our great benefactor Arthur Tressler.

59:35.656 --> 59:37.283
Big applause! Big applause!

59:37.492 --> 59:38.826
Art, actually, why don't
you come up on stage

59:38.910 --> 59:40.077
for the finale?

59:40.161 --> 59:41.954
- Come on down, Art!
- Come on down, Art!

59:42.038 --> 59:43.956
There he goes. Okay, good.

59:44.040 --> 59:45.082
Are we on red?

59:45.166 --> 59:47.210
Bright red. We're all standing by.

59:47.293 --> 59:48.753
All right, no one leaves the theater. No one.

59:48.836 --> 59:50.004
There he goes.

59:50.630 --> 59:52.840
Now, Art, did you fill out your envelope?

59:52.924 --> 59:54.759
Well, no need. We've done it for you.

59:55.426 --> 59:58.221
Now, Art, I took a guess.

59:58.304 --> 01:00:00.515
North of 140. Am I right?

01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:04.310
That's 140 million, by the way.

01:00:07.939 --> 01:00:08.940
I'm sorry, Merritt.

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:11.025
How can he be right about his balance

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:12.276
and everyone else be wrong?

01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:15.780
I think possibly because he, too, is wrong.

01:00:15.947 --> 01:00:18.074
Everybody, take out your paper.

01:00:18.241 --> 01:00:20.785
And using the flashlight under your seat,

01:00:20.952 --> 01:00:22.787
start to warm up that paper.

01:00:22.954 --> 01:00:26.123
I think your correct balance
begins to appear.

01:00:29.752 --> 01:00:32.964
Now, Art, don't worry,
we have a flashlight for you.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:34.340
Yes.

01:00:41.097 --> 01:00:42.473
Look.

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:44.642
What's going on there, Daniel?

01:00:44.725 --> 01:00:46.227
Wait. This is weird. A second ago, it said

01:00:46.477 --> 01:00:50.231
$144,579,651.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:51.315
But now...

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:54.860
Now it says $70,000 less.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:00:59.615
Josepha, can you stand up?

01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:00.741
Yes.

01:01:00.992 --> 01:01:02.660
Now, what is your new number?

01:01:02.952 --> 01:01:07.290
$70,562 now in my account.

01:01:10.418 --> 01:01:13.796
Is it possible that
Josepha's balance went up

01:01:13.921 --> 01:01:16.007
the exact amount that Art's went down?

01:01:16.132 --> 01:01:18.634
Hey. Check it out. It's happening again.

01:01:19.051 --> 01:01:20.094
IS it?

01:01:21.512 --> 01:01:23.848
Wow. It is.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:27.351
Art's balance has gone down another 280K.

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:29.562
Dina Robertson? What did yours say?

01:01:29.812 --> 01:01:33.566
$281,477.

01:01:37.403 --> 01:01:39.071
We have a confession to make.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:41.282
She's right. We lied about something.

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:43.034
Yes. None of you were chosen at random.

01:01:43.159 --> 01:01:45.578
All of you have one thing in common.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.997
Everyone in this room was a victim

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.958
of the hard times that hit one of
America's most treasured cities.

01:01:51.042 --> 01:01:53.628
Some of you lost your houses, your cars.

01:01:54.086 --> 01:01:55.087
Your businesses.

01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:56.255
Your loved ones.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:59.550
But all of you were insured
by the same company.

01:01:59.717 --> 01:02:01.594
Tressler Insurance.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.888
You were abandoned.

01:02:03.971 --> 01:02:05.056
You were loopholed...

01:02:05.139 --> 01:02:06.349
...out of your settlements.

01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:10.353
This is all for show. Correct?

01:02:10.436 --> 01:02:12.980
"All" meaning we're doing it onstage
in front of a paying audience?

01:02:13.272 --> 01:02:14.899
- Then, yes, it's for show.
- Whoa! Whoa!

01:02:15.191 --> 01:02:17.693
I've got $82,000 in my bank account!

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:19.695
It says it right here on my cell phone!

01:02:19.945 --> 01:02:23.074
Everybody, look at your
cell phones right now! Everybody!

01:02:30.873 --> 01:02:31.874
Is this for real?

01:02:32.083 --> 01:02:33.250
I don't know.

01:02:33.542 --> 01:02:34.627
<i>Is this happening?</i>

01:02:34.794 --> 01:02:36.379
I don't know! I can't tell!

01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:39.256
Hey! Did you do this?

01:02:40.466 --> 01:02:41.676
How could we, Art?

01:02:41.759 --> 01:02:42.927
We don't have your password.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.553
We'd need access to information

01:02:44.637 --> 01:02:46.555
we could never get our hands on.

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:48.724
Yes, security questions, for instance, like,

01:02:48.933 --> 01:02:50.476
I don't know, your mother's maiden name

01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:52.061
or the name of your first pet.

01:02:52.144 --> 01:02:53.938
Where would we get that information, Art?

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:56.065
You certainly would never tell us.

01:02:58.859 --> 01:03:00.945
<i>We got confirmation.
It's really happening. They robbed him.</i>

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.740
Do not let them get away.

01:03:04.824 --> 01:03:06.826
Hey, we left you the jet and the Rolls.

01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:15.126
You got hell to pay!

01:03:18.129 --> 01:03:19.130
Stop!

01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:21.632
Stop! Nobody move!

01:03:23.592 --> 01:03:24.677
Freeze!

01:03:24.927 --> 01:03:26.470
Quarterback!

01:03:29.348 --> 01:03:31.350
We are The Four Horsemen.

01:03:31.851 --> 01:03:32.935
Good night.

01:03:45.156 --> 01:03:46.532
Get 'em off me!

01:03:47.283 --> 01:03:48.868
Get off! Get off me!

01:03:59.211 --> 01:04:00.588
Get off me!

01:04:09.013 --> 01:04:11.182
All right. I want everyone
on the street! Everyone!

01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:19.899
- Quarterback!
- Quarterback!

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:22.860
Fuller, meet me in front of the theater

01:04:22.943 --> 01:04:24.528
and bring the tracker.

01:04:24.612 --> 01:04:26.989
Let's go! Let's go! Now! Come on! Let's go!

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:28.199
Give me the tracker.

01:04:28.657 --> 01:04:29.658
Let's go.

01:04:33.788 --> 01:04:35.080
FBI! Clear!

01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:36.957
- Dylan!
- Damn.

01:04:37.041 --> 01:04:38.042
What have you got?

01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:39.627
That's him right there. Follow the red dot.

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:42.755
All right, I'll take this.
Go. Box 'em. Cut 'em off that way.

01:04:44.715 --> 01:04:46.258
He's turning left on Burgundy.

01:05:22.962 --> 01:05:24.505
Hey! Move!

01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:25.923
Move! Move!

01:05:28.592 --> 01:05:30.302
I got him heading north on Bourbon.

01:05:30.386 --> 01:05:32.263
- Sorry. Move, move!
- Hey!

01:05:32.346 --> 01:05:34.348
Hey, excuse me. Move, move! Excuse me.

01:05:45.818 --> 01:05:47.486
I've lost him at Bourbon.

01:05:52.867 --> 01:05:54.869
Damn! Where are you?

01:06:06.839 --> 01:06:08.048
Excuse me.

01:06:14.138 --> 01:06:16.140
He's heading south on Exchange Place.

01:06:18.517 --> 01:06:19.560
Stop!

01:06:26.567 --> 01:06:27.902
What are you doing?

01:06:31.363 --> 01:06:33.490
He's going in Napoleon House.

01:06:35.534 --> 01:06:37.077
Move! Move!

01:06:37.953 --> 01:06:39.496
Move out of the way!

01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:41.206
Hey!

01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:43.042
Move!

01:06:45.377 --> 01:06:47.630
He's in the bathroom.
I have him in the bathroom.

01:06:47.755 --> 01:06:50.049
No!No!No!

01:06:51.926 --> 01:06:53.093
Freeze!

01:06:53.928 --> 01:06:55.220
Lower your weapons!

01:06:55.471 --> 01:06:56.555
What?

01:06:56.805 --> 01:06:58.807
I'm tracking myself!

01:06:59.308 --> 01:07:01.268
<i>The Horsemen
left egg on the face of what they call</i>

01:07:01.352 --> 01:07:03.020
<i>the alphabet agencies,</i>

01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:04.271
<i>calling into question</i>

01:07:04.396 --> 01:07:06.649
<i>the efficacy of the FBI's task force</i>

01:07:06.774 --> 01:07:09.485
<i>as well as the man in charge
of the investigation,</i>

01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:11.028
<i>Special Agent Dylan Rhodes,</i>

01:07:11.111 --> 01:07:12.780
<i>who was publicly ridiculed,</i>

01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:15.741
<i>and even tackled at tonight's performance.</i>

01:07:16.116 --> 01:07:17.368
<i>Talk about a fumble.</i>

01:07:17.451 --> 01:07:19.286
<i>This is quickly becoming a national story,</i>

01:07:19.578 --> 01:07:22.373
<i>as The Horsemen have now
seemingly pulled off the impossible</i>

01:07:22.581 --> 01:07:24.875
<i>for the second time in as many days.</i>

01:07:25.125 --> 01:07:26.835
<i>Two nights ago in Vegas, The Horsemen</i>

01:07:26.961 --> 01:07:28.337
<i>seemingly robbed a bank in Paris...</i>

01:07:28.629 --> 01:07:29.797
Hey.

01:07:30.965 --> 01:07:32.091
What are you doing?

01:07:32.174 --> 01:07:33.550
I'm having a drink.

01:07:36.637 --> 01:07:38.013
I came to get you.

01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:39.807
I'm worried about you.

01:07:39.974 --> 01:07:41.475
You're worried about me.
Well, I'm worried about you.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.726
Atlas. You had him.

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:44.061
He didn't have a weapon.

01:07:44.144 --> 01:07:45.646
I couldn't shoot him and you know that.

01:07:45.771 --> 01:07:48.607
Yeah, but you... You let him go.

01:07:48.774 --> 01:07:49.984
Didn't you?

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.236
A pretty French girl
shows up out of the blue,

01:07:52.319 --> 01:07:54.029
acts like she's my partner
and then she lets the bad guy go?

01:07:54.113 --> 01:07:55.239
Let go of my arm.

01:07:55.322 --> 01:07:56.991
Who exactly are you anyway?

01:07:59.159 --> 01:08:01.161
I thought you said you were a desk agent.

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:07.459
Not bad.

01:08:09.378 --> 01:08:10.379
What is this?

01:08:13.382 --> 01:08:14.842
What's the Eye of Horus?

01:08:15.009 --> 01:08:18.011
Oh, certainly nothing
I want to get into tonight.

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:20.680
You're dismissive enough
about me when you're sober.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.350
Find your way back yourself.

01:08:27.354 --> 01:08:30.524
Mr. Bradley? Mr. Tresslerwould like you
to join him for a drink.

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:40.993
Sir.

01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:42.453
Thank you.

01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:46.040
What is your role with them?

01:08:46.206 --> 01:08:47.207
Role?

01:08:47.416 --> 01:08:49.126
Yes. You seem to know
everything about them.

01:08:49.209 --> 01:08:51.002
What they're gonna do.
Where they're gonna be.

01:08:51.211 --> 01:08:52.880
If it makes you feel any better,

01:08:53.005 --> 01:08:54.214
this wasn't about you.

01:08:54.298 --> 01:08:57.760
Please tell me why this was not about me.

01:08:58.510 --> 01:09:01.095
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:03.682
Played out on a global scale.

01:09:04.058 --> 01:09:08.020
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

01:09:08.562 --> 01:09:11.356
The distraction, while they
set up the real trick.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:15.736
I was a $140-million distraction?

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:17.738
Yes.

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:22.576
And that very ego that got you involved
with them in the first place

01:09:23.035 --> 01:09:24.578
is what keeps you from seeing that.

01:09:24.703 --> 01:09:26.246
- You know...
-"I can destroy you."

01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:27.747
Yes, I do know.

01:09:27.956 --> 01:09:29.249
Well, you won't.

01:09:29.792 --> 01:09:31.960
And you won't destroy them.

01:09:32.086 --> 01:09:34.129
Whatever this grand trick is,

01:09:34.421 --> 01:09:37.216
it was designed a long time ago.

01:09:37.424 --> 01:09:41.970
And I believe that what's about to follow
is really going to amaze.

01:09:42.805 --> 01:09:47.350
So I suggest
you sit back and enjoy your front row seat.

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:50.479
You paid quite a lot of good money for it.

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.731
Whatever you stand to make

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:58.403
I'll double it, if you expose them now.

01:09:58.612 --> 01:09:59.988
And destroy them.

01:10:00.405 --> 01:10:02.407
I stand to make five million.

01:10:03.117 --> 01:10:04.368
Am I flinching?

01:10:06.495 --> 01:10:08.080
No, you're not.

01:11:28.869 --> 01:11:29.995
Hey.

01:11:31.371 --> 01:11:33.582
I'm sorry for your arm.

01:11:33.665 --> 01:11:35.250
No. I'm sorry.

01:11:35.334 --> 01:11:37.586
I was an asshole. I was drunk.

01:11:39.546 --> 01:11:42.174
I'm at a loss.

01:11:44.092 --> 01:11:49.473
You know, when Merritt said I hardly spent
any time away from the desk, he was right.

01:11:49.556 --> 01:11:52.851
I'm a researcher. That's what I do best.

01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:57.856
So what's this all about?

01:11:58.565 --> 01:12:01.234
Supposedly, if you buy into it,

01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:02.694
The Eye are the keepers

01:12:02.778 --> 01:12:03.946
of real magic

01:12:04.029 --> 01:12:06.949
and the protectors of those who practice it.

01:12:07.032 --> 01:12:08.951
"Candidates for initiations

01:12:09.034 --> 01:12:12.204
"must follow a series of commands
with blind obedience."

01:12:13.205 --> 01:12:16.416
- This isn't real.
- But there are some who think it is.

01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:18.418
May I?

01:12:20.212 --> 01:12:24.508
According to this,
they only take new people twice a century.

01:12:24.591 --> 01:12:28.011
So what? The Horsemen are doing
these shows in order to get into this thing?

01:12:28.095 --> 01:12:29.304
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

01:12:29.388 --> 01:12:34.393
I mean, I guess these guys
could just rob banks to rob banks.

01:12:34.476 --> 01:12:36.812
They don't have to put on a show for that.

01:12:36.895 --> 01:12:38.397
It's probably just a myth.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.609
But it doesn't make any sense,
and I don't think logic will solve this for us.

01:12:42.693 --> 01:12:45.278
- You don't say?
- No.

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:51.159
Ibefieve
that some things are only discovered

01:12:51.243 --> 01:12:55.622
if you take certain leaps.

01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:05.757
- Well, I gotta get to...
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:13:05.841 --> 01:13:08.010
- Thanks. Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

01:13:08.093 --> 01:13:09.886
- Sorry.
-It's all right.

01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:15.851
If The Eye did exist, we'd have to assume
they were watching us, right?

01:13:15.934 --> 01:13:17.185
Shit.

01:13:17.269 --> 01:13:19.896
I think someone is watching us,
but it isn't magic.

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:22.941
Your fears are correct.
This is not and has never been your phone.

01:13:23.025 --> 01:13:27.738
It's a clone in every way, except for this.

01:13:27.821 --> 01:13:29.114
A bug.

01:13:29.197 --> 01:13:33.035
Someone has
heard every call, read every text.

01:13:33.285 --> 01:13:34.494
That's how
they were able to stay ahead of us.

01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:35.454
God damn it!

01:13:36.788 --> 01:13:38.582
Get me Atlas' interrogation tape.

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:40.459
Yes, sir. I have it on the hard drive.

01:13:42.294 --> 01:13:43.378
Picture's up.

01:13:43.837 --> 01:13:45.589
Okay, fast forward.

01:13:45.964 --> 01:13:47.424
Go on, go on. Freeze!

01:13:48.216 --> 01:13:50.010
Okay. Frame by frame. Go on.

01:13:50.886 --> 01:13:51.928
Play it through.

01:13:53.055 --> 01:13:55.348
Stop. Zoom in tighter. Tighter.

01:13:55.807 --> 01:13:57.601
There. That's where he took my phone.

01:13:58.894 --> 01:14:00.062
Is that thing transmitting?

01:14:00.228 --> 01:14:01.646
Only when
you're making a call or sending a text.

01:14:01.855 --> 01:14:02.814
Plus I removed the bug.

01:14:02.898 --> 01:14:04.441
All right. Put it back in
and turn on the phone.

01:14:04.691 --> 01:14:06.485
They don't know
that we know about the bug.

01:14:06.693 --> 01:14:08.695
As of this instant, we are ahead of them.

01:14:08.779 --> 01:14:10.906
We need to keep it that way. Understand?

01:14:11.323 --> 01:14:12.657
Find my real phone and track it.

01:14:12.741 --> 01:14:16.078
Already did. As of about 20 minutes ago,
it's in New York City.

01:14:16.286 --> 01:14:17.329
Good.

01:14:17.704 --> 01:14:19.414
I wanna cut 'em off at the knees.

01:14:19.498 --> 01:14:20.582
They got power? Cut it.

01:14:20.791 --> 01:14:24.086
They got phones, electricity, water? Cut it.

01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:25.337
Squeeze 'em out.

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:27.172
I want 'em to feel our presence.

01:14:27.255 --> 01:14:28.757
And get me an airplane!

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.345
The firewall's down.
Do they know about this?

01:14:33.428 --> 01:14:34.387
They who?

01:14:34.471 --> 01:14:36.264
"They," "them," whoever we're working for.

01:14:36.473 --> 01:14:37.641
Who are we working for?

01:14:37.766 --> 01:14:39.851
And are we prepared to go to jail for them?

01:14:39.935 --> 01:14:40.936
Stop being paranoid.

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:42.229
It really does happen.

01:14:42.437 --> 01:14:44.022
It happened to you.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen to us.

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:45.732
Guys, I don't know if can do this, all right.

01:14:45.816 --> 01:14:47.109
I don't want to go to jail, you know?

01:14:47.192 --> 01:14:48.985
Then don't screw up.
You're always talking about

01:14:49.069 --> 01:14:50.278
wanting to be treated like an adult.

01:14:50.362 --> 01:14:51.530
Now might be a good time
to start acting like one.

01:14:51.613 --> 01:14:53.782
Stick to the plan. Stay here and burn it all.

01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:08.088
I don't know what I'm doing here.

01:15:08.296 --> 01:15:09.256
I don't know
what you would do anywhere else.

01:15:09.339 --> 01:15:11.800
I'm here for the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

01:15:12.134 --> 01:15:14.261
That's it. Then I'm gone.

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:16.513
You can do whatever you want
when this is over, Merritt.

01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:18.849
But until then, you stick to the plan.

01:15:18.932 --> 01:15:20.976
Hey, guys. They're here.

01:15:22.811 --> 01:15:24.813
- My guys are ready to go.
- Let's do this quickly...

01:15:24.896 --> 01:15:26.189
- No.
- What?

01:15:26.273 --> 01:15:27.482
She doesn't have jurisdiction here.

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:28.984
She's Interpol. She's with me.

01:15:29.067 --> 01:15:30.068
She stays.

01:15:30.152 --> 01:15:31.444
What? What?

01:15:31.528 --> 01:15:32.529
Stay in the car.

01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:35.991
Let's go.

01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:42.664
Okay. Let's do it.

01:15:47.127 --> 01:15:48.128
FBI!

01:15:52.382 --> 01:15:53.717
Ladies first.

01:15:54.301 --> 01:15:55.510
Don't move!

01:16:01.558 --> 01:16:03.018
Tell me.

01:16:03.101 --> 01:16:04.853
Is my money being well-spent?

01:16:05.353 --> 01:16:07.272
Exceedingly well.

01:16:09.024 --> 01:16:10.525
Now you tell me,

01:16:11.318 --> 01:16:12.986
how do you like your Horsemen?

01:16:13.153 --> 01:16:15.197
Fricasseed or fried?

01:16:15.447 --> 01:16:16.489
Shredded.

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:19.034
I'll tell the Chef.

01:17:34.609 --> 01:17:35.610
Freeze!

01:17:42.784 --> 01:17:43.785
Dylan!

01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:45.912
Hold on!

01:17:48.248 --> 01:17:49.291
You little...

01:17:53.795 --> 01:17:54.796
Come here!

01:17:56.548 --> 01:17:58.466
Five is clear. Standing by for six.

01:17:58.675 --> 01:17:59.843
You little Shit!

01:17:59.926 --> 01:18:00.927
You little Shit!

01:18:01.011 --> 01:18:03.221
- What game are you playing?
- What game are you playing?

01:18:03.555 --> 01:18:05.598
We're all good at six. Move to seven.

01:18:05.682 --> 01:18:07.726
Copy that. Going to seven. Go, go, go!

01:18:08.393 --> 01:18:10.395
No, no, no, no, no. Go back!

01:18:10.979 --> 01:18:12.105
Hey!

01:18:13.857 --> 01:18:15.066
Come here!

01:18:46.097 --> 01:18:47.223
Come here!

01:18:47.307 --> 01:18:49.017
All right, hold on, hold on!

01:18:50.935 --> 01:18:52.771
- Really?
- Yup.

01:18:56.941 --> 01:18:57.942
You...

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:03.239
You little...

01:19:19.297 --> 01:19:20.340
Shit!

01:19:38.733 --> 01:19:39.776
Shit!

01:19:41.152 --> 01:19:42.529
Give me that!

01:20:08.513 --> 01:20:10.473
<i>All units, cover the north exit now!</i>

01:20:10.557 --> 01:20:11.850
Clear on Evan.

01:20:11.933 --> 01:20:13.768
<i>Block every possible exit.</i>

01:20:13.852 --> 01:20:15.353
Hey! Get back. Shit.

01:20:16.855 --> 01:20:18.982
- FBI. Sort of. I need your car. Thanks.
- What?

01:20:19.065 --> 01:20:20.066
What?

01:20:22.193 --> 01:20:23.820
Stop! Stop!

01:20:39.961 --> 01:20:41.004
Hey!

01:21:10.825 --> 01:21:11.743
Good. Follow him!

01:21:11.868 --> 01:21:13.912
Don't ever tell me to stay in the car. Ever.

01:21:13.995 --> 01:21:15.330
I didn't have tactical command.

01:21:15.413 --> 01:21:17.790
If you don't trust me, just tell me.

01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:19.459
Promise me, next time, you will back me up.

01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:21.586
Could we have
this conversation later, please?

01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:23.254
No!

01:21:23.338 --> 01:21:25.590
Okay, fine, I promise. Now, go!

01:21:33.056 --> 01:21:35.558
- Where'd they go?
- Where are they?

01:21:35.642 --> 01:21:37.310
I don't know. She just took some guy's car.

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:38.853
- Where are they?
- That way. That way.

01:21:38.937 --> 01:21:39.979
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

01:21:40.063 --> 01:21:41.522
Let's go.

01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:08.132
There he is!

01:22:20.019 --> 01:22:21.020
Move!

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:26.442
Left!

01:22:28.778 --> 01:22:30.571
We're heading east on the FDR Drive.

01:22:30.655 --> 01:22:32.490
- This is not east.
- North! North!

01:22:32.573 --> 01:22:34.617
- We're heading north on the FDR Drive.
- What?

01:22:34.701 --> 01:22:36.786
<i>We're coming to you live above the FDR,</i>

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:39.789
<i>where NYPD
and federal agents, as you now see,</i>

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:41.791
<i>are engaged in a high-speed pursuit,</i>

01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:43.126
<i>following a black sedan.</i>

01:22:48.298 --> 01:22:49.299
<i>Fuller, where are you?</i>

01:22:49.549 --> 01:22:51.342
Right here. Trying to catch up to you now.

01:22:51.426 --> 01:22:53.469
<i>We're now trying to get you a better shot.</i>

01:22:55.972 --> 01:22:57.056
Come on!

01:23:12.822 --> 01:23:13.948
<i>It looks like they're turning</i>

01:23:14.032 --> 01:23:16.159
<i>onto the 59th Street Bridge.</i>

01:23:18.202 --> 01:23:19.787
<i>As soon as we have them within range,</i>

01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:21.706
<i>we will bring you those pictures live.</i>

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:28.421
Good. Just stay with him.

01:23:35.803 --> 01:23:37.055
Go, go, go!

01:23:41.059 --> 01:23:42.602
Behind... You're behind the bus!

01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:47.231
Get over!

01:23:50.818 --> 01:23:51.861
Oh, shit!

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:16.552
Come here!

01:24:17.804 --> 01:24:19.222
Get back! Get back!

01:24:20.723 --> 01:24:22.016
Dylan, let's go, man!

01:24:22.225 --> 01:24:23.226
Come on, you...

01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:26.771
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

01:24:26.854 --> 01:24:28.231
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!

01:24:28.314 --> 01:24:30.233
Let's go! Leave him!

01:24:35.029 --> 01:24:36.406
'The Paper!
- Dylan!

01:24:36.656 --> 01:24:38.574
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

01:25:03.766 --> 01:25:08.020
<i>Today, the unfolding story of a popular
and controversial group of magicians,</i>

01:25:08.104 --> 01:25:10.106
<i>who have been fast capturing
the public's imagination,</i>

01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:13.526
<i>took a dark turn when a police action
that began in Chinatown</i>

01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:17.405
<i>developed into a dramatic, high-speed
chase across the 59th Street Bridge,</i>

01:25:17.488 --> 01:25:20.449
<i>which caused a fatal collision
that took the life of Jack Wilder,</i>

01:25:20.533 --> 01:25:22.827
<i>one of the so-called Four Horsemen.</i>

01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:28.124
<i>The whereabouts of the other three
Horsemen remain unknown at this time.</i>

01:25:33.004 --> 01:25:35.673
Dylan, they just
figured out what the paper was in Jack's car.

01:25:35.756 --> 01:25:37.049
So they know what it is?

01:25:37.133 --> 01:25:38.843
And why the kid died trying to protect it.

01:25:38.926 --> 01:25:40.595
Evans is on his way to brief us right now.

01:25:40.678 --> 01:25:42.221
Let's go.

01:25:42.305 --> 01:25:43.598
You're gonna wanna take this first, though.

01:25:43.681 --> 01:25:44.682
What's that?

01:25:44.765 --> 01:25:47.059
Your friend Thaddeus Bradley.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:48.811
Rhodes.

01:25:48.895 --> 01:25:50.521
You do understand the function

01:25:50.605 --> 01:25:52.732
of the magician's assistant,
don't you, Agent Rhodes?

01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:54.525
Yeah, she's there to distract them

01:25:54.609 --> 01:25:55.818
while he sets up the trick.

01:25:57.069 --> 01:25:59.238
You'd be right if you weren't so wrong.

01:25:59.655 --> 01:26:01.407
<i>While you're watching the magician,</i>

01:26:02.241 --> 01:26:04.493
<i>that lovely innocent
is actually pulling the strings.</i>

01:26:04.702 --> 01:26:07.830
<i>Don't you find it peculiar
that Interpol would send you</i>

01:26:07.914 --> 01:26:11.375
a first timer off the desk
to be your assistant?

01:26:11.834 --> 01:26:14.003
Why did she request to be put on the case?

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:16.339
She was assigned to the case.

01:26:17.215 --> 01:26:18.591
Luck of the draw.

01:26:19.175 --> 01:26:22.261
Like choosing a random card in the deck.

01:26:22.428 --> 01:26:26.015
I find it odd, your sudden act of generosity.

01:26:26.098 --> 01:26:27.225
What's in it for you?

01:26:27.391 --> 01:26:29.227
Just trying to even the game.

01:26:29.435 --> 01:26:33.439
I feel like I'm playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers.

01:26:34.607 --> 01:26:38.361
Keep up, Agent Rhodes. Keep up.

01:26:42.198 --> 01:26:43.282
Hey.

01:26:43.574 --> 01:26:44.784
We got a problem.

01:26:45.952 --> 01:26:47.036
Here's the safe.

01:26:47.119 --> 01:26:48.579
No, no, no. Hey.

01:26:48.663 --> 01:26:49.956
What's he doing here?

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:51.707
Giving us our first solid lead.

01:26:51.791 --> 01:26:53.668
We've been investigating
a private security contractor

01:26:53.751 --> 01:26:54.919
called Elkhorn

01:26:55.002 --> 01:26:56.963
-for the last five years.
- And?

01:26:57.046 --> 01:26:58.714
They've been hiding close
to a half billion dollars...

01:26:58.798 --> 01:27:01.259
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

01:27:01.634 --> 01:27:03.970
The money's in a vault inside
a warehouse in Queens.

01:27:04.136 --> 01:27:06.639
We think this vault
is your magicians' final target.

01:27:06.806 --> 01:27:08.724
The magician who died on the bridge...

01:27:08.808 --> 01:27:12.270
You pulled our classified Elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand.

01:27:12.645 --> 01:27:14.647
And despite their bullshit
Robin Hood razzle-dazzle,

01:27:14.939 --> 01:27:16.816
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves.

01:27:16.899 --> 01:27:18.109
How did they get the file?

01:27:19.402 --> 01:27:20.403
This is the part you're gonna find

01:27:20.486 --> 01:27:22.446
particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.

01:27:22.655 --> 01:27:24.949
They patched to my server
after they accessed

01:27:25.032 --> 01:27:27.326
your mobile command center
in New Orleans

01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:28.995
with codes they got from your phone.

01:27:31.163 --> 01:27:32.999
You ordered us all out to chase after them.

01:27:33.416 --> 01:27:36.002
The level of incompetence
displayed on this case,

01:27:36.085 --> 01:27:38.587
that's a magic trick in and of itself.

01:27:38.671 --> 01:27:40.923
Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

01:27:42.341 --> 01:27:44.260
Boss, he's taking over?

01:27:44.802 --> 01:27:46.804
Let's go, gentlemen.

01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:49.557
Hey.

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.100
Hey. I want to have a word with you.

01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:52.351
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

01:27:52.435 --> 01:27:54.478
- Why the hell did you take this case?
- What?

01:27:54.562 --> 01:27:56.731
People say I'm "hard to read."
That's an American expression.

01:27:56.814 --> 01:27:58.232
Do you understand it?

01:27:58.316 --> 01:27:59.358
Yes.

01:27:59.483 --> 01:28:01.736
Good, then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you.

01:28:01.819 --> 01:28:04.196
If I find out that you are anything other than

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.573
who you say you are, I swear...

01:28:05.698 --> 01:28:07.491
And we French also have an expression.

01:28:09.327 --> 01:28:10.995
"Faith can move mountains."

01:28:11.078 --> 01:28:12.747
If we hope to capture The Horsemen,

01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:14.665
then you need to have a little faith in me.

01:28:14.915 --> 01:28:16.917
Because I've done nothing
to deserve otherwise.

01:28:17.001 --> 01:28:19.754
I just got my ass handed to me.

01:28:19.837 --> 01:28:21.380
I am losing this case.

01:28:21.464 --> 01:28:24.800
So faith is a luxury
I don't have any time for right now.

01:28:31.015 --> 01:28:33.225
<i>More than anything in his life,</i>

01:28:33.309 --> 01:28:38.689
Jack wanted to be
the most famous magician who ever lived.

01:28:38.773 --> 01:28:40.149
And I can't say he achieved it,

01:28:40.232 --> 01:28:44.195
but I do hope wherever he is,
it is full of magic.

01:28:45.946 --> 01:28:48.282
But the point is... Sorry.

01:28:48.366 --> 01:28:49.825
The point is...

01:28:49.909 --> 01:28:56.123
The point of why we are here is to say
that we are not... We cannot quit now.

01:28:56.207 --> 01:28:58.751
<i>We've started something
bigger than all of us.</i>

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:00.669
<i>We have to finish it.</i>

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:10.805
<i>Approaching the warehouse.</i>

01:29:10.888 --> 01:29:13.391
<i>Units 5 and 6
cover the north and south entrances.</i>

01:29:13.474 --> 01:29:14.725
<i>We are going for the vault.</i>

01:29:19.814 --> 01:29:22.733
Hey. Where's the safe? Where's the safe?

01:29:26.904 --> 01:29:27.905
What is this?

01:29:27.988 --> 01:29:29.365
Where the hell is the goddamn safe?

01:29:29.448 --> 01:29:31.325
We just moved it while you were outside.

01:29:31.409 --> 01:29:32.576
- Evans' orders.
- What?

01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:33.702
I never said that.

01:29:33.786 --> 01:29:35.121
Sir, you got a phone call

01:29:35.246 --> 01:29:36.831
and said Washington wants the safe moved.

01:29:36.914 --> 01:29:38.999
You never heard that
come out of my mouth, Agent.

01:29:39.083 --> 01:29:39.750
What happened?

01:29:40.292 --> 01:29:42.545
You tell me what's going on,
because this is bullshit!

01:29:42.628 --> 01:29:43.712
No!

01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:51.095
Jesus Christ.

01:29:51.303 --> 01:29:54.265
Sir? Sir? What are you doing?

01:29:54.348 --> 01:29:56.225
I think it's Beethoven's Concerto <i>in</i> D-Major.

01:29:56.308 --> 01:29:57.309
Where's the safe?

01:29:57.393 --> 01:29:58.477
His team is loading the truck.

01:30:02.773 --> 01:30:04.442
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

01:30:05.985 --> 01:30:07.153
- Stop the truck!
- Stop!

01:30:08.154 --> 01:30:10.322
- Stop!
- Hey! Stop that truck!

01:30:18.956 --> 01:30:20.833
What the hell's going on?
We got our orders.

01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:22.668
Now you've got new orders. Open it up.

01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:28.424
Okay. Here's what I want.

01:30:28.507 --> 01:30:30.759
At this moment,
they think that safe's leaving this site.

01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:32.136
So we stay with it.

01:30:32.219 --> 01:30:34.138
We follow it
all the way to... Where's it going?

01:30:34.388 --> 01:30:35.473
5 Pointz. Up the street.

01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:38.809
So we go to 5 Pointz.
Wherever the safe goes, we go.

01:30:39.018 --> 01:30:40.102
It'll lead us right to 'em.

01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:42.188
You two are with me.

01:30:54.825 --> 01:30:56.076
Guys.

01:30:57.036 --> 01:30:59.538
Look. Office just called with this.

01:30:59.622 --> 01:31:01.499
Horsemen posted it to YouTube
20 minutes ago.

01:31:01.874 --> 01:31:05.461
<i>The point of why we're here
is to say that we are not...</i>

01:31:05.711 --> 01:31:07.546
<i>We cannot quit now.</i>

01:31:07.713 --> 01:31:10.216
<i>We've started something
bigger than all of us.</i>

01:31:10.382 --> 01:31:11.967
<i>We have to finish it.</i>

01:31:12.051 --> 01:31:14.595
<i>Remember the name Jack Wilder
when you see us live,</i>

01:31:14.678 --> 01:31:16.555
<i>5 Pointz, Queens, 7:00.</i>

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:17.890
Their show is in a half an hour.

01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:19.225
It's exactly where we're headed.

01:31:19.391 --> 01:31:21.519
I don't know, boss.
I don't wanna be the naysayer,

01:31:21.727 --> 01:31:23.687
but these guys are kinda tricky.

01:31:23.771 --> 01:31:26.398
Rhodes, they're entertainers.

01:31:28.901 --> 01:31:31.070
<i>A stunning turnout here in 5 Pointz</i>

01:31:31.153 --> 01:31:34.990
<i>as the renegade Horsemen
taunt the FBI into a final showdown.</i>

01:31:35.074 --> 01:31:36.492
<i>The Horsemen have invited
us to their final round</i>

01:31:36.575 --> 01:31:38.744
<i>of their three-act face-off with the FBI.</i>

01:31:39.245 --> 01:31:42.581
<i>What do they have in store?
We're about to find out.</i>

01:31:53.926 --> 01:31:56.178
<i>All eyes on the truck.
Let's see who approaches.</i>

01:31:56.262 --> 01:31:57.596
Copy that.

01:32:13.779 --> 01:32:15.614
<i>Agents Rhodes, Fuller?</i>

01:32:16.282 --> 01:32:17.283
Go, for us.

01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:20.077
We've got movement.
Someone's walking toward the truck.

01:32:20.202 --> 01:32:21.662
<i>It's a woman.</i>

01:32:25.416 --> 01:32:26.584
- Freeze!
- Oh, shit!

01:32:28.377 --> 01:32:29.878
What the hell's going on?

01:32:30.963 --> 01:32:33.299
Hey! It's the guy from the TV.

01:32:33.382 --> 01:32:34.425
Put your guns down.

01:32:34.633 --> 01:32:37.469
Look who it is. The fifth Horseman.

01:32:37.636 --> 01:32:38.637
Are you kidding?

01:32:38.721 --> 01:32:40.556
I'm following them, just like you are.

01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:42.224
I'm not following anybody anymore.

01:32:42.308 --> 01:32:44.059
You've been ahead of us this whole time.

01:32:44.143 --> 01:32:45.769
But guess what? I'm ahead of you now.

01:32:45.978 --> 01:32:47.605
Your ass is mine.

01:32:47.813 --> 01:32:49.565
You guys are still idiots.

01:32:49.773 --> 01:32:50.816
Yeah?

01:32:50.899 --> 01:32:51.984
This happens to be the former

01:32:52.109 --> 01:32:54.153
rehearsal space for Lionel Shrike.

01:32:54.612 --> 01:32:56.447
It's where I did my first show.

01:32:56.655 --> 01:32:59.450
Now, if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots,

01:32:59.658 --> 01:33:00.909
why not open it?

01:33:01.285 --> 01:33:02.911
And while you're doing it, Agent Rhodes,

01:33:03.203 --> 01:33:04.830
would you mind reenacting your look

01:33:05.039 --> 01:33:06.957
of absolute befuddlement for me?

01:33:07.124 --> 01:33:09.209
It will make a wonderful cover for my DVD.

01:33:10.544 --> 01:33:11.795
Open the safe.

01:33:11.879 --> 01:33:13.380
- Go ahead.
- Open it.

01:33:17.718 --> 01:33:18.761
What the hell?

01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:22.264
What?

01:33:22.514 --> 01:33:23.599
Give me that.

01:33:23.807 --> 01:33:24.850
No.

01:33:25.017 --> 01:33:26.018
No!

01:33:30.648 --> 01:33:31.690
What is this?

01:33:32.816 --> 01:33:33.817
Get back!

01:33:41.408 --> 01:33:43.535
Who doesn't love a good magic trick?

01:33:44.203 --> 01:33:46.538
They have you chasing empty safes again.

01:33:47.873 --> 01:33:51.043
Once again, misdirection.

01:33:58.008 --> 01:33:59.635
The show is starting. Move out!

01:33:59.718 --> 01:34:02.221
The question
I'd be asking now, Agent Rhodes is,

01:34:02.721 --> 01:34:04.848
"What happened to the real one?"

01:34:25.494 --> 01:34:27.246
Clear! Clear 'em out!

01:34:27.329 --> 01:34:28.914
Come on. Move 'em out.
Move 'em out of the way.

01:34:30.332 --> 01:34:32.209
FBI! Give me a path!

01:34:32.835 --> 01:34:34.420
Clear out! Clear out!

01:34:34.670 --> 01:34:36.046
<i>What is magic?</i>

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:37.923
<i>Magic is deception.</i>

01:34:38.048 --> 01:34:39.758
<i>But deception designed to delight,</i>

01:34:40.008 --> 01:34:41.677
<i>to entertain, to inspire.</i>

01:34:41.885 --> 01:34:44.221
Look out! Clear! Clear! Look out!

01:34:44.596 --> 01:34:45.681
<i>It is about belief.</i>

01:34:45.764 --> 01:34:46.765
<i>Faith.</i>

01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:47.891
<i>Trust.</i>

01:34:51.895 --> 01:34:53.272
<i>Without those qualities,</i>

01:34:53.355 --> 01:34:56.775
<i>magic, as an art form,
would no longer exist.</i>

01:34:57.359 --> 01:34:59.194
<i>But what happens if these qualities</i>

01:34:59.403 --> 01:35:01.363
<i>are not used for their higher purpose?</i>

01:35:01.572 --> 01:35:04.366
<i>And instead they're used to cheat, lie.</i>

01:35:04.575 --> 01:35:06.785
<i>For personal gain or for greed.</i>

01:35:06.952 --> 01:35:08.620
<i>Then it's no longer magic.</i>

01:35:08.787 --> 01:35:09.872
<i>It's crime.</i>

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:13.083
<i>So tonight, for our final act,</i>

01:35:13.167 --> 01:35:16.003
<i>you're gonna help us set a few things right.</i>

01:35:20.132 --> 01:35:21.300
What's going on here, Rhodes?

01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:22.718
I don't know.

01:35:23.802 --> 01:35:24.970
Showtime.

01:35:30.142 --> 01:35:31.143
Look!

01:35:35.481 --> 01:35:37.399
There they are on the roof. Let's move!

01:35:37.483 --> 01:35:38.776
Go, go, go!

01:35:39.485 --> 01:35:40.819
- Dylan!
- FBI, coming through!

01:35:42.404 --> 01:35:43.447
What are you doing here?

01:35:43.572 --> 01:35:44.656
They're going in the wrong direction

01:35:44.782 --> 01:35:45.824
and you know it.

01:35:46.116 --> 01:35:48.452
Rhodes! I need all personnel now!

01:35:48.577 --> 01:35:51.914
You need to trust me.
Take your leap of faith.

01:35:52.748 --> 01:35:53.832
Wait.

01:35:54.124 --> 01:35:55.292
I'm going to go with her.

01:35:55.459 --> 01:35:56.710
Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

01:35:58.545 --> 01:35:59.588
Go ahead!

01:35:59.671 --> 01:36:01.173
That's on you, Fuller.

01:36:16.563 --> 01:36:20.609
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

01:36:31.703 --> 01:36:32.788
Daniel?

01:36:33.622 --> 01:36:34.790
Yeah?

01:36:34.915 --> 01:36:39.545
As our, let's call it,
year of living dangerously

01:36:39.753 --> 01:36:43.090
comes to a close,
in a rare moment of vulnerability,

01:36:43.298 --> 01:36:45.968
I'd like to express a sentiment

01:36:46.051 --> 01:36:47.636
to you about our relationship.

01:36:47.886 --> 01:36:48.929
Okay.

01:36:49.304 --> 01:36:52.808
Well, when I first met you,
I thought you were kind of a

01:36:54.643 --> 01:36:55.644
dick.

01:36:57.145 --> 01:36:58.188
And?

01:36:59.982 --> 01:37:01.650
No, that's it.

01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:02.901
That's very nice.

01:37:02.985 --> 01:37:04.486
- Yeah.
- I'm touched.

01:37:04.653 --> 01:37:06.113
Yeah. Just from the heart.

01:37:06.321 --> 01:37:07.906
Well, I didn't tell you where I was touched.

01:37:08.031 --> 01:37:09.074
Oh, you!

01:37:12.661 --> 01:37:14.329
Oh, God.
What are we gonna do when this is over?

01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:15.664
We're on our own.

01:37:15.747 --> 01:37:17.416
Our instructions run out after the show.

01:37:18.333 --> 01:37:20.210
Even if there is no "Eye,"

01:37:20.294 --> 01:37:22.004
if we were completely played and we spend

01:37:22.129 --> 01:37:24.131
the next 20 years in jail, then,

01:37:24.673 --> 01:37:26.341
I just want to say that...

01:37:26.592 --> 01:37:28.969
I know. Me, too.

01:37:30.304 --> 01:37:32.222
Little too sentimental for me.

01:37:39.187 --> 01:37:40.272
There they are!

01:37:43.275 --> 01:37:46.028
Go grab 'em! Put 'em down! Go, go, go!

01:37:46.153 --> 01:37:47.154
Grab 'em!

01:37:52.159 --> 01:37:53.201
Get up!

01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:54.828
What the hell?

01:37:58.624 --> 01:37:59.791
Shit!

01:38:09.009 --> 01:38:10.260
Hello, New York!

01:38:18.727 --> 01:38:20.687
Thank you for the magic.

01:38:20.896 --> 01:38:21.980
And thank you for being such

01:38:22.064 --> 01:38:25.067
an incredible and dedicated audience.

01:38:25.484 --> 01:38:27.486
Unfortunately, like all good things,

01:38:27.569 --> 01:38:29.363
it must come to an end.

01:38:32.074 --> 01:38:34.576
So we would like to start our show tonight...

01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:36.203
By saying goodbye.

01:38:37.579 --> 01:38:38.914
All we wanted was to

01:38:38.997 --> 01:38:40.957
bring the world to a magic show.

01:38:41.041 --> 01:38:42.501
And thereby bring a little magic

01:38:42.584 --> 01:38:43.752
back to the world.

01:38:47.756 --> 01:38:48.924
Clear the way!

01:38:58.684 --> 01:39:01.895
This has been
one hell of a ride for all of us.

01:39:02.437 --> 01:39:04.773
But it's time for us to disappear.

01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:06.274
Good night, New York.

01:39:06.525 --> 01:39:07.943
And thank you for believing in us.

01:39:10.612 --> 01:39:11.738
Stop!

01:39:15.242 --> 01:39:16.243
Freeze!

01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:17.828
No!

01:39:35.929 --> 01:39:37.222
God damn it!

01:40:05.834 --> 01:40:07.043
I'm sorry.

01:40:07.711 --> 01:40:09.713
You were right. It's bigger than all of us.

01:40:10.672 --> 01:40:14.760
This is one time I'm not happy being right.

01:40:17.095 --> 01:40:18.722
So I guess this is it.

01:40:20.766 --> 01:40:21.933
IS it?

01:40:48.043 --> 01:40:49.336
Dylan!

01:40:49.711 --> 01:40:52.172
Dylan! Dylan!

01:40:52.255 --> 01:40:53.298
Hey.

01:40:54.633 --> 01:40:56.593
- You see that?
- What?

01:41:00.222 --> 01:41:01.598
Where's the real money?

01:41:17.823 --> 01:41:21.785
You're under arrest! Hands in the air! Now!

01:42:13.003 --> 01:42:14.129
I've been framed.

01:42:15.463 --> 01:42:16.506
I'm sure you were.

01:42:16.590 --> 01:42:17.883
Yeah, but I can prove it.

01:42:18.383 --> 01:42:19.634
I always do.

01:42:20.010 --> 01:42:21.970
Just like I predicted that you'd play the fool.

01:42:22.053 --> 01:42:24.556
Let's just drop the theatricality, all right?

01:42:24.806 --> 01:42:26.975
The cameras aren't rolling in here.

01:42:27.183 --> 01:42:29.686
Fellas, can I have a few minutes
with my friend here alone, please.

01:42:29.769 --> 01:42:31.605
Sure.

01:42:36.568 --> 01:42:37.611
All right.

01:42:38.653 --> 01:42:40.280
I got information to trade.

01:42:40.405 --> 01:42:41.573
I believe that's how it's done. Huh?

01:42:41.781 --> 01:42:43.408
If it's of some value.

01:42:45.869 --> 01:42:49.039
These bars give a man time to think.

01:42:50.248 --> 01:42:53.501
And I'm pretty sure I know how they did it.

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:56.087
<i>Remember the rabbit trick
in the second show?</i>

01:42:57.255 --> 01:42:59.090
<i>The box was never empty.</i>

01:43:01.426 --> 01:43:02.594
<i>The room wasn't either.</i>

01:43:03.887 --> 01:43:06.264
<i>After gaining access to the warehouse,</i>

01:43:06.598 --> 01:43:08.683
<i>The Horsemen left the real safe</i>

01:43:08.767 --> 01:43:11.186
<i>and transformed the whole room</i>

01:43:11.269 --> 01:43:13.772
<i>into a giant rabbit box.</i>

01:43:15.357 --> 01:43:17.525
<i>You go charging in there,</i>

01:43:17.776 --> 01:43:20.195
<i>thinking the safe was already gone.</i>

01:43:20.445 --> 01:43:21.404
Hey!

01:43:21.488 --> 01:43:22.781
Hey! Stop!

01:43:22.989 --> 01:43:24.407
Missing the trick. Again.

01:43:24.491 --> 01:43:25.533
Which was to make you think

01:43:25.784 --> 01:43:27.327
the safe had already been stolen,

01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:29.621
so you'd drop your guard and leave.

01:43:30.205 --> 01:43:33.166
<i>Now, while you were busy
playing with balloon animals,</i>

01:43:33.375 --> 01:43:35.961
<i>someone was breaking into the warehouse.</i>

01:43:54.479 --> 01:43:55.647
<i>Who?</i>

01:43:57.065 --> 01:43:58.566
<i>Jack Wilder.</i>

01:43:59.317 --> 01:44:00.652
Holy shit.

01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:03.238
No. No way. He died
right in front of my eyes.

01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:06.157
Unless, of course, he didn't.

01:44:13.498 --> 01:44:14.749
It's locked.

01:44:15.542 --> 01:44:16.751
Weren't you listening?

01:44:17.252 --> 01:44:18.336
Nothing's ever locked.

01:44:19.713 --> 01:44:22.507
Well done, Mr. Wilder! Good work.

01:44:22.674 --> 01:44:24.509
You're a big boy now, Jack.

01:44:24.676 --> 01:44:27.053
He escaped in a standard FBI vehicle, right?

01:44:30.849 --> 01:44:32.183
<i>Led you to the bridge.</i>

01:44:32.434 --> 01:44:34.060
<i>Where the other Horsemen were waiting</i>

01:44:34.185 --> 01:44:36.062
<i>with an identical replacement car.</i>

01:44:37.063 --> 01:44:38.064
<i>It only took a split second</i>

01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:39.149
<i>for you to lose contact with it</i>

01:44:39.232 --> 01:44:40.233
<i>and make the switch.</i>

01:45:02.547 --> 01:45:05.550
<i>When you crawled into that burning car,</i>

01:45:05.925 --> 01:45:07.927
<i>quite heroically, I might add,</i>

01:45:09.804 --> 01:45:11.890
<i>you almost died trying to rescue</i>

01:45:11.973 --> 01:45:14.976
<i>what I assume was
a cadaver from the morgue.</i>

01:45:16.478 --> 01:45:20.148
<i>Why go through
such an elaborate and dangerous plan</i>

01:45:20.899 --> 01:45:22.400
just to frame one guy?

01:45:22.734 --> 01:45:23.777
I don't know.

01:45:23.902 --> 01:45:25.320
They never kept any of the money they took.

01:45:25.403 --> 01:45:27.822
Yeah, that's the part
I haven't been able to put together yet.

01:45:27.906 --> 01:45:30.617
But I just gave you information that
is substantially more important.

01:45:30.742 --> 01:45:32.452
- No. Not really.
- What?

01:45:32.535 --> 01:45:37.082
I finally got a chance to
really look into Lionel Shrike.

01:45:37.373 --> 01:45:40.126
His comeback attempt. His accident.

01:45:41.086 --> 01:45:44.589
The insurer who denied the family's claim?

01:45:44.798 --> 01:45:46.007
Tressler Insurance.

01:45:47.926 --> 01:45:50.178
The bank that carried the note?

01:45:51.262 --> 01:45:52.931
Credit Republican of Paris.

01:45:53.139 --> 01:45:54.766
Credit Republicain de Paris.

01:45:56.101 --> 01:45:57.519
What do you make of that?

01:45:57.602 --> 01:45:59.771
A sucker is born every minute.

01:46:00.522 --> 01:46:03.108
What if all this was just leading up to

01:46:03.191 --> 01:46:05.902
us getting mugged
in Central Park at 2:00 a.m.?

01:46:05.985 --> 01:46:08.696
No, I'm telling you,
we're right where we need to be.

01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:09.864
We just have to find...

01:46:09.948 --> 01:46:11.074
That?

01:46:13.618 --> 01:46:15.328
The Lionel Shrike tree.

01:46:16.287 --> 01:46:18.790
And the card encased in glass.

01:46:20.125 --> 01:46:21.751
What do we do now?

01:46:38.393 --> 01:46:39.853
Oh, nice!

01:46:55.702 --> 01:46:57.162
<i>So, here's my new theory.</i>

01:46:57.662 --> 01:47:01.082
The legend is that the "Eye" is everywhere.

01:47:01.749 --> 01:47:02.917
Waiting

01:47:03.334 --> 01:47:07.088
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves

01:47:08.047 --> 01:47:09.841
from the mediocre ones.

01:47:10.675 --> 01:47:11.885
Maybe that was you.

01:47:12.510 --> 01:47:14.762
Deep down inside
you wanted nothing more

01:47:14.846 --> 01:47:17.473
than to be part of the "Eye,"
but you were never invited.

01:47:17.557 --> 01:47:20.727
So you try to destroy them.
But instead what happens?

01:47:21.186 --> 01:47:22.687
You pissed them off.

01:47:24.397 --> 01:47:27.442
The Eye isn't real.

01:47:27.525 --> 01:47:30.612
Okay, then, explain then.
Who's behind all this?

01:47:30.862 --> 01:47:32.197
Somebody with an obsession.

01:47:32.447 --> 01:47:33.865
- Meticulous.
- Who?

01:47:33.948 --> 01:47:37.285
Somebody prepared to sacrifice everything.

01:47:37.368 --> 01:47:39.954
Somebody so prepared to lose

01:47:40.038 --> 01:47:42.540
that they wouldn't even be a suspect
until the trick was done.

01:47:42.624 --> 01:47:45.460
I don't want a profile.
I need a name. Who? Who?

01:47:45.543 --> 01:47:47.212
I don't know who.

01:47:47.587 --> 01:47:49.797
But they had to have
access to the warehouse

01:47:49.881 --> 01:47:51.216
to plant the mirrors.

01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:56.387
Always a step ahead of me. And the FBI.

01:47:56.471 --> 01:47:59.724
Got past them not once,
not twice, but consistently.

01:48:00.058 --> 01:48:02.685
Almost as if they were on the...

01:48:15.573 --> 01:48:16.950
The inside.

01:48:29.087 --> 01:48:30.129
You.

01:48:34.759 --> 01:48:35.760
Why?

01:48:36.594 --> 01:48:38.930
That is the question, isn't it?

01:48:39.764 --> 01:48:41.307
You're right.

01:48:41.933 --> 01:48:44.269
I can't tell you how long I've waited

01:48:44.352 --> 01:48:46.312
to see the look on your face.

01:48:48.773 --> 01:48:50.275
Who are you?

01:48:51.359 --> 01:48:52.777
What do you want from me?

01:48:53.611 --> 01:48:55.113
What do I want?

01:48:55.530 --> 01:48:58.449
I want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell,

01:48:58.533 --> 01:49:02.537
staring at four walls
and wondering how you missed it.

01:49:03.204 --> 01:49:06.291
How you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego

01:49:06.874 --> 01:49:09.294
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead

01:49:09.377 --> 01:49:12.130
when you were always two steps behind.

01:49:16.801 --> 01:49:18.011
Dylan?

01:49:18.970 --> 01:49:19.971
Wait a minute.

01:49:21.014 --> 01:49:23.141
Dylan! How did this happen?

01:49:30.815 --> 01:49:32.483
Dylan!

01:49:32.608 --> 01:49:33.609
Why?

01:49:34.319 --> 01:49:35.320
Why?

01:49:39.324 --> 01:49:41.492
Oh, my God.

01:49:42.493 --> 01:49:44.370
I did not see that coming.

01:49:44.495 --> 01:49:45.747
That's impossible!

01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:46.831
No way.

01:49:46.914 --> 01:49:49.334
That was actually pretty good.

01:49:49.751 --> 01:49:50.835
Thank you.

01:49:51.252 --> 01:49:53.463
When I said,
"Always be the smartest guy in the room."

01:49:53.546 --> 01:49:54.589
We were in agreement.

01:49:54.839 --> 01:49:56.007
Okay. Right.

01:49:56.382 --> 01:49:57.383
Henley.

01:49:58.176 --> 01:50:00.011
I've never seen her speechless.

01:50:00.094 --> 01:50:01.679
I take that as a huge compliment.

01:50:02.388 --> 01:50:05.058
Hey, man,
I'm so sorry for kicking your ass. Really.

01:50:05.850 --> 01:50:07.352
Hey, listen, for the record,

01:50:07.518 --> 01:50:11.022
I have always been a 100% believer.

01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:13.441
And the amount of energy
I have expended to keep

01:50:13.524 --> 01:50:15.651
these infidels on point...

01:50:15.735 --> 01:50:17.779
Merritt, you're in.

01:50:18.613 --> 01:50:19.697
God bless.

01:50:19.781 --> 01:50:20.823
Come.

01:50:21.866 --> 01:50:25.036
The real magic is taking
four strong solo acts

01:50:25.244 --> 01:50:27.121
and making them all work together.

01:50:27.372 --> 01:50:29.665
And that's exactly what you did.

01:50:30.625 --> 01:50:31.709
So welcome.

01:50:35.046 --> 01:50:37.090
Welcome to the Eye.

01:51:44.282 --> 01:51:46.367
It was all connected.

01:51:46.993 --> 01:51:49.996
Credit Republican. Tressler Insurance.

01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:00.673
And Elkhorn?

01:52:00.798 --> 01:52:02.717
What's the connection to Shrike?

01:52:05.219 --> 01:52:08.431
Elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer.

01:52:08.764 --> 01:52:10.892
They used cheap steel.

01:52:12.477 --> 01:52:13.769
They cut corners.

01:52:13.853 --> 01:52:17.064
When he got
to the bottom of the river, the safe warped.

01:52:17.148 --> 01:52:18.524
And he was trapped.

01:52:20.067 --> 01:52:21.652
He was your father.

01:52:23.529 --> 01:52:26.866
<i>The morning before the show
didn't feel like any other day.</i>

01:52:27.909 --> 01:52:32.914
<i>When my father said he had to go to work,
he could see that I didn't want him to leave.</i>

01:52:35.166 --> 01:52:40.296
<i>So he gave me his watch, and he told me
to count the seconds until he came back.</i>

01:52:41.464 --> 01:52:44.175
<i>I have never let his watch stop since then.</i>

01:52:44.258 --> 01:52:46.385
And from that moment on,

01:52:46.469 --> 01:52:49.013
I created a persona.

01:52:49.639 --> 01:52:51.557
I planned. I worked out every detail.

01:52:51.641 --> 01:52:54.936
But the one thing
that I couldn't imagine happening

01:52:55.353 --> 01:52:56.520
was you.

01:52:58.189 --> 01:53:01.150
And I know that
the logical conclusion for you

01:53:01.651 --> 01:53:04.403
is to take this case to its resolution.

01:53:04.487 --> 01:53:07.531
And for you to turn me in.

01:53:12.662 --> 01:53:13.704
Yeah.

01:53:15.665 --> 01:53:19.502
But you know how I feel
about resolution and logic.

01:53:20.878 --> 01:53:22.213
And you also know

01:53:23.089 --> 01:53:27.426
that I think some things
are best left unexplained.

01:53:33.933 --> 01:53:35.726
One more secret to lock away.

01:54:03.296 --> 01:54:04.797
<i>Come in close.</i>

01:54:05.298 --> 01:54:06.549
<i>Closer.</i>

01:54:06.632 --> 01:54:08.884
<i>Because now you know our secret.</i>

01:54:08.968 --> 01:54:11.304
<i>We could be anywhere. Watching you.</i>

01:54:11.929 --> 01:54:15.558
<i>We're looking for someone
to help us with our next trick.</i>

01:54:15.641 --> 01:54:18.185
<i>On the count of three, open your eyes</i>

01:54:18.269 --> 01:54:20.229
<i>and tell me what you see.</i>

01:54:21.230 --> 01:54:22.315
<i>One.</i>

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:23.441
<i>Two...</i>

01:55:55.282 --> 01:55:57.159
Please, stop, stop, stop.

01:55:57.535 --> 01:56:01.247
All right, stop the van. Stop the van.
I'm gonna jump out of the van.

01:56:02.248 --> 01:56:03.707
Oh, thank God.

01:56:05.668 --> 01:56:07.753
Where are we?

01:56:07.837 --> 01:56:10.256
Great, another shit hole.

01:56:10.339 --> 01:56:12.258
Okay, feeling it.

01:56:12.341 --> 01:56:16.512
I'm exhausted, and hungry, and cranky.

01:56:17.555 --> 01:56:19.431
Check out this place.

01:56:19.515 --> 01:56:22.309
- Where'd you bring us?
- Was there no landfill where we were?

01:56:22.393 --> 01:56:24.270
This place is awesome.

01:56:25.813 --> 01:56:26.814
Is this our new gear?

01:56:26.897 --> 01:56:28.440
There'd better not be, like,
matching jumpsuits in there.

01:56:28.524 --> 01:56:29.567
You know I don't wear spandex.

01:56:29.650 --> 01:56:32.027
-It's Locked.
- Guys, the cards.

01:56:32.111 --> 01:56:34.655
- What card?
- What do you mean, "what card"?

01:56:38.742 --> 01:56:39.743
Okay.
