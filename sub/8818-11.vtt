WEBVTT

00:09.092 --> 00:10.135
- What is the meaning
of this...?

00:13.847 --> 00:17.016
A warrior
from the Bad Realm?

00:17.100 --> 00:19.102
Show me your face!

00:23.857 --> 00:28.445
- Is that the best you've got,
Witty Wizard?

00:28.528 --> 00:29.779
- Witty Wizard...?

00:29.863 --> 00:32.156
I haven't heard that name
since...

00:35.201 --> 00:39.330
- Since we graduated,
that's right!

00:39.873 --> 00:42.292
- Leopold Archer...

00:42.375 --> 00:43.626
How did you get in here?

00:43.710 --> 00:46.254
- Ah, you know me, Mike,
I've got my ways.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.216
- Please, call me Agamemnon.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.303
We don't want to confuse
the students.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.847
- Oh, here, a souvenir
from the Bad Realm.

00:55.930 --> 00:56.765
Took it off a witch who
tried to hide there.

00:56.848 --> 00:59.559
But you know what they say...

00:59.642 --> 01:03.646
Leo Archer always gets
his witch.

01:03.730 --> 01:07.525
- So, what's an agent of
the Realm Intelligence Service

01:07.609 --> 01:09.319
doing at the WITS Academy?

01:09.402 --> 01:12.238
- What I'm about to tell you is
in strict confidence...

01:12.322 --> 01:15.116
I'm hunting a fugitive
who escaped Limbo.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.328
And I'm afraid she went
hiding here at the Academy.

01:18.411 --> 01:22.874
- Oh, dear, do we know
what this witch looks like?

01:34.260 --> 01:36.679
It can't be...

01:36.763 --> 01:38.681
- You know this girl?

01:38.765 --> 01:40.350
- Hey, I was wondering if--

01:40.433 --> 01:44.103
Oh, sorry, didn't realize
you had company.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.356
- Hold it,

01:46.439 --> 01:47.774
criminal!

01:47.857 --> 01:50.235

- Whoa, hey!

02:31.985 --> 02:33.736
Is that any way
to say hello?

02:33.820 --> 02:36.239
- Leopold, stop it!

02:36.322 --> 02:38.783
Miss Cruz is not a fugitive.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.994
She can be a bit of
a nuisance...

02:41.077 --> 02:43.204
- Aggie!
- ...but she's not a criminal!

02:43.288 --> 02:47.041
In fact, she's not even a witch!
[powers zapping]

02:48.376 --> 02:51.379
- If you're wrong,
you just aided and abetted

02:51.462 --> 02:55.383
one of the most wanted
witches in the Realm.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.759
- Witches and fugitives?

02:56.843 --> 02:59.429
I just came by to see if you had
a chance to examine the leaves

02:59.512 --> 03:00.930
I found in the atrium?

03:01.014 --> 03:01.931
- The Dyad Tree's lost leaves?

03:02.015 --> 03:04.642
- I'll fill you in later.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.897
- This doesn't even look
like me!

03:08.980 --> 03:13.067
This looks like Ruby.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.111
- That sneaky little con artist.

03:15.194 --> 03:18.281
- That's Ruby for ya.
- Nah! Don't you see?

03:18.364 --> 03:19.365
She placed a hex
on her own wanted poster,

03:19.449 --> 03:22.285
so whoever looks at it
sees someone different.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.995
- And you saw me?

03:24.078 --> 03:25.121
Thanks!

03:25.204 --> 03:26.289
- She's heard too much.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.625
We're gonna have
to get rid of her.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.794
- [powers zapping]

03:31.878 --> 03:33.338
- Hey?

03:33.421 --> 03:34.672
How did I get down
the stairs so fast?

03:34.756 --> 03:37.467
And who are you?

03:37.550 --> 03:42.513
- Ah, I see the Witty Wizard
hasn't lost his touch.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.308
- If she isn't the fugitive,
then who is?

03:45.391 --> 03:50.438
- Don't worry, Leo Archer
is gonna hunt her down.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.654
- What are you doing?

03:57.737 --> 03:59.322
- Hiding from Luke.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.449
He's trying to woo me
into going out with him.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.493
What if he starts serenading
me with a romantic song

04:03.576 --> 04:05.286
or something?

04:05.370 --> 04:07.580
- That would be
so embarrassing.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.333
- Hey, Luke.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.377
Andi's over here.
- What?

04:17.298 --> 04:20.510
Hey, uh, sorry,
I lost a contact lens.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.762
- Oh, no. Did you find it?

04:24.055 --> 04:25.348
- Hey, Andi...

04:25.431 --> 04:26.724
I'm really sorry
about yesterday.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.142
But you have to understand,
the flowers and all that stuff,

04:28.226 --> 04:31.312
it wasn't me.
- Sure looked like you.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.274
But then again,
my eyesight is pretty bad.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.360
- No, you see, Sean and Gracie
tried to play matchmaker,

04:37.443 --> 04:40.238
so they put--

04:40.321 --> 04:41.447
- What were you gonna say?

04:41.531 --> 04:45.451
- I gotta go.
Uh, let's talk later.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.453
- What did you
bring him over for?

04:47.537 --> 04:50.248
- Oh, just because Ruby said
I'd get a reward every time

04:50.331 --> 04:52.375
I embarrass you.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.668
- Uncle Leopold?

04:53.751 --> 04:54.794
What are you doing here?

04:54.877 --> 04:56.087
- It's classified.

04:56.170 --> 05:00.800
I could tell you, but then I'd
have to send you into the Abyss.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.677
- You're on a secret mission,
aren't you?

05:02.760 --> 05:04.053
Don't worry.
I won't say anything.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.430
Oh, my favorite nephew--

05:05.513 --> 05:06.097
sharp as a whip.

05:06.180 --> 05:08.057
Well, let's get breakfast.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.517
I'll catch you up
on some of my adventures.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.602
- ROBOTIC VOICE:
Attention, students.

05:11.686 --> 05:12.729
- Am I live?

05:12.812 --> 05:14.689
Testing, testing.

05:14.772 --> 05:15.857
Oh, hi!

05:15.940 --> 05:16.816
I mean...

05:16.899 --> 05:20.153
Good morning, student body
of WITS Academy.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.363
Headmaster Agamemnon asked me
to inform you that today's

05:22.447 --> 05:26.200
curriculum consists of WITs
learning Spell Attacks,

05:26.284 --> 05:29.078
while Guardians work
on their shields.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.663
- Spell Attacks!
Bring it on!

05:30.747 --> 05:33.541
- Oh, no,

05:33.624 --> 05:35.793
I think Ben's about
to throw up.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.170
Again.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.087
- A preliminary round
of shield tests will be held

05:38.171 --> 05:40.381
first thing tomorrow morning,

05:40.465 --> 05:42.842
so your shields better be
primed and ready.

05:42.925 --> 05:46.471
- Shields
and Spells instructor?

05:46.554 --> 05:49.057
- To flush out this fugitive,
I need to operate undercover.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.934
Now, let's start
with one-on-one interrogations,

05:52.018 --> 05:55.480
I mean, interviews,

05:55.563 --> 05:57.899
so I can get to know
my "new students."

05:57.982 --> 05:59.942
- You mean suspects?

06:00.026 --> 06:03.488
Very well, I can tell you
that all of them have been

06:03.571 --> 06:06.032
here at the Academy
for over a year--

06:06.115 --> 06:08.576
except for Jessie and Miss Cruz.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.870
- Never underestimate
a fugitive on the run.

06:10.953 --> 06:13.372
She probably removed a student
and has taken over his

06:13.456 --> 06:15.625
or her identity
with a Doppelganger Spell.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.043
She could be a Guardian.

06:17.126 --> 06:18.795
She could be a WIT.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.797
She could even be you.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.840
- Do what you need
to do to catch

06:22.924 --> 06:25.968
this devious lawbreaker.

06:26.928 --> 06:30.598
- So, I hear you're new
to the Academy.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.560
Where were you living before?
[laughing]

06:34.644 --> 06:35.812
In Limbo?

06:35.895 --> 06:37.563
- No, in my dad's house.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.898
It's complicated.

06:38.981 --> 06:39.941
- Have you ever used...

06:40.024 --> 06:42.652
a forbidden spell?

06:42.735 --> 06:43.236
- How could I?

06:43.319 --> 06:45.446
I don't have any powers.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.781
- What's your favorite subject?

06:46.864 --> 06:48.324
- Is this part
of your secret mission?

06:48.407 --> 06:50.910
- Have you ever broken
any rules?

06:50.993 --> 06:53.412
- Let's see...

06:53.496 --> 06:55.832
- When did you say you started
at the Academy?

06:55.915 --> 06:57.166
- Am I in trouble?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.417
- What's your favorite color?

06:58.501 --> 07:00.336
- You ask a lot of
questions, mister.

07:00.419 --> 07:02.547
- Where did you steal
that necklace?

07:02.630 --> 07:04.090
- I didn't steal it.
I made it.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.592
Look, it's a little
tiny flashlight.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.011
- Do you have any secrets?

07:09.095 --> 07:10.847
- No.
- Oh, great.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.640
I'll see you in class.

07:12.723 --> 07:13.182
- Any leads?

07:13.266 --> 07:15.518
- All I know is...

07:15.601 --> 07:17.687
I hope it's not Gracie.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.480
She scares me.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.861
- My teach wants us to play,
let my skills blow him away!

07:24.944 --> 07:27.738
[powers zapping]

07:30.449 --> 07:33.161
- Always have an ace
up your sleeve.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.497
Keep working.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.586
- Okay, we need
an ace up our sleeve.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.463
Can any of you make
a high-voltage, single-charge,

07:44.547 --> 07:46.716
magic absorber?

07:50.052 --> 07:52.388
- Hey, Andi, what I was trying
to say earlier was--

07:52.471 --> 07:54.182
- Is he trying to sneak a peek
at our shield design?

07:54.265 --> 07:56.767
- Back to your workbench,
mister.

07:56.851 --> 07:57.560
- But...Uncle Leopold...

07:57.643 --> 08:01.230
- Wait.
This is your uncle?

08:01.314 --> 08:03.566
Oh, yeah, I thought
you looked familiar.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.318
- That's Professor Archer
to you.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.240
Tell me something, Andi,

08:11.324 --> 08:12.408
how did you get into
the WITS Academy?

08:12.491 --> 08:15.161
- Special request,
by the Chosen One,

08:15.244 --> 08:17.705
thank you very much.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.207
- Why would the Chosen One
request a human be admitted

08:19.290 --> 08:22.043
into the Guardian program?

08:22.126 --> 08:26.589
- Because, I'm gonna be
Emma's Guardian once I graduate.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.090
- You want to be
Guardian to the Chosen One?

08:28.174 --> 08:31.802
- Yes, didn't Preppy--

08:31.886 --> 08:33.888
I mean Luke,
tell you about that?

08:33.971 --> 08:36.640
- No.

08:36.724 --> 08:37.600
He did not.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.561
This is top heavy.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.231
Make sure the center takes
the brunt of the attack,

08:43.313 --> 08:45.316
or you'll be in trouble.

08:46.275 --> 08:47.902
- I can't believe
I'm saying this,

08:47.985 --> 08:50.571
but I think I miss Andi.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.281
- PROF. ARCHER: All right.
Time's up.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.950
Guardians, work on your shields.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.077
WITs, change into your Practice
Outfits for Spell Attack class.

08:56.160 --> 09:00.373
Luke, can I have a word...

09:12.009 --> 09:14.679
What's going on
with you and Andi?

09:14.762 --> 09:16.305
- Oh, Andi?

09:16.389 --> 09:18.349
Oh, she's just a friend.

09:18.432 --> 09:21.227
Though she and her WITs did win
the all time obstacle course

09:21.310 --> 09:24.313
record after I trained her.

09:24.397 --> 09:28.776
- You trained a competitor?

09:28.859 --> 09:32.863
Are you aware she wants to be
Guardian to the Chosen One?

09:32.947 --> 09:34.991
- Yes.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.701
- Well, you're not gonna
let that happen, are you?

09:36.784 --> 09:37.827
- Don't worry.

09:37.910 --> 09:38.995
Whoever graduates
on top of the Board

09:39.078 --> 09:41.914
from the Academy, gets to choose
their future assignment.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.041
And I'm gonna choose
to guard Emma.

09:44.125 --> 09:47.336
- Atta boy.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.716
"Defensa Abta Antiquare!"

09:51.799 --> 09:54.885
- We shall forever be Guardians!

09:56.470 --> 09:57.513
- Wait.

09:57.596 --> 09:59.849
You want to put the Guardian
Amulet on your shield?

09:59.932 --> 10:01.350
You think that's a good idea?

10:01.434 --> 10:02.518
- No...

10:02.601 --> 10:04.186
It's a brilliant idea!

10:04.270 --> 10:07.064
I mean, Aggie said the Amulet
protects you from bad spells.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.191
And Archer said to keep
an ace up your sleeve.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.111
So...?
- Let's do it!

10:12.945 --> 10:21.245
- ♪

10:38.471 --> 10:39.555
- You're really
rockin' that shield.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.684
- Let's go take him
out for a test run.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.811
- So these are the leaves
Andi found in the atrium?

10:48.522 --> 10:51.192
I'm detecting an
M-square of delta six.

10:51.275 --> 10:54.320
Factored by omega.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.238
- [gasps]
Two sources of energy?

10:56.322 --> 10:58.115
- One is the tree's
own magical energy,

10:58.199 --> 10:59.909
the other comes from a spell.

10:59.992 --> 11:04.705
But that's not what
caused the leaves to fall.
