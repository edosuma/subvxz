00:24.558 --> 00:27.628
Yay!
You guys see that sporting
event last night?

00:27.661 --> 00:31.099
You know I did!
My team scored all the points!

00:32.733 --> 00:35.336
Hey, hey!
What about that race car we
saw yesterday, huh?

00:35.369 --> 00:38.472
It was all like...

00:38.506 --> 00:41.675
No, bro, it was like...

00:43.177 --> 00:44.712
Oh, man.

00:44.745 --> 00:47.515
Guys, hold up! Shh!

00:50.451 --> 00:53.154
-Oh man, that one stunk!
-Speak too, Cyborg.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.322
This is so annoying.

00:55.723 --> 00:59.293
Ooh! They are giving me
the aches of the head.

00:59.327 --> 01:02.296
We're being such boys right
now and I love it!

01:02.330 --> 01:04.698
Boys! Boys! Boys! Boys!

01:07.601 --> 01:09.837
B...b...b... Boys.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.839
B...b...b... Boys.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.874
Boys.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.210
B...b...b... Boys.

01:17.345 --> 01:21.182
B...b...b...
Boys, in your face!

01:21.215 --> 01:22.850
Quiet!

01:22.883 --> 01:24.685
Uh, what's her problem?

01:24.718 --> 01:29.390
I'll tell you her problem.
She's a "her",
you know, a girl.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.160
That's right. She wishes
she could be a boy...

01:32.193 --> 01:34.862
-But she can't.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.331
Why would we wish
to be the boys?

01:37.365 --> 01:39.567
Because of one simple fact.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.571
Boys are better than girls!

01:45.506 --> 01:48.809
How can one say
one gender is
superior to the other?

01:48.842 --> 01:50.911
Well, Starfire,

01:50.944 --> 01:54.348
if you ever took the knowledge
train down town to the corner
of Science and Fact,

01:54.382 --> 01:56.317
you'd know girls
can never compete with boys,

01:56.350 --> 02:01.322
because they're too busy lying
around, thinking about how
they look and being emotional.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.493
Uh, lying around?

02:05.526 --> 02:07.595
You're the ones who are lazy!

02:07.628 --> 02:11.365
And you spend much more time
on your hair appearance
than do we.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.270
And if you're going
to bring up emotional...

02:16.304 --> 02:18.206
Stop yelling at us!

02:22.710 --> 02:24.512
Oh, my self-esteem.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.913
Still think boys are better?

02:25.946 --> 02:27.848
Of course they are!
In fact, I could go on and on

02:27.881 --> 02:29.783
about all the reasons girls
are worse than boys,

02:29.817 --> 02:32.886
but I'm going to sum it up
in just one word...

02:32.920 --> 02:33.921
Cooties!

02:35.423 --> 02:37.291
You're crawling with them!

02:37.325 --> 02:39.627
We don't want your cooties!

02:39.660 --> 02:42.196
As you can see from this
chart, created by a boy,

02:42.230 --> 02:44.432
science tells us that there is
no evidence in girls

02:44.465 --> 02:47.235
of sugar, spice
or anything nice.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.570
What there is, is cooties!

02:49.603 --> 02:51.272
Oh, gross!

02:51.305 --> 02:53.274
Gross indeed, Beast Boy.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.408
I rest my case.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.577
I have the cooties?

02:56.610 --> 02:59.347
No, you don't.
Cooties aren't real.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.215
If boys are so much better,
then prove it.

03:01.249 --> 03:04.452
We challenge you to a contest,
Boys vs. Girls.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.373
Very well.

03:31.545 --> 03:35.383
Okay, 10 laps
around the island.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.686
I wish you the luck
that is good, Beast Boy.

03:38.719 --> 03:42.356
You're going down, girl!
It's cheetah time!

03:44.492 --> 03:47.661
On your mark, get set...

03:59.039 --> 04:01.442
What took you so long?

04:03.811 --> 04:06.947
First one to solve this
complex math equation wins.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.816
You're going down!

04:13.421 --> 04:15.489
Don't forget the factor...

04:15.523 --> 04:16.890
RAVEN: Done!

04:31.071 --> 04:32.373
Dig deep!

04:32.406 --> 04:35.643
Be the future!
Be the future!

04:39.012 --> 04:40.047
The pull!

04:40.080 --> 04:42.616
Come on, Star, we got this.

05:01.902 --> 05:02.970
Well, girls win.

05:03.003 --> 05:06.407
Dude, you lied to us!
Girls are better than boys!

05:06.440 --> 05:08.609
Yeah, boys are terrible.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.944
From now on, we're girls!

05:12.580 --> 05:15.583
-Yeah!
Whoa!
But what about the cooties?

05:15.616 --> 05:17.851
Don't worry, girls,
he lied about that too.

05:24.492 --> 05:25.759
You look cootie free to me.

05:25.793 --> 05:28.696
So, girls, you see that
sporting event...

05:28.729 --> 05:33.634
Uh, I mean, um,
did you guys...
Argh... What...

05:33.667 --> 05:35.436
What exactly do you two
do anyway?

05:35.469 --> 05:38.706
Yeah, come to think of it,
what do you girls do?

05:38.739 --> 05:41.041
Well, you know,
I read from my spell book...

05:42.009 --> 05:44.011
While fighting an evil demon!

05:45.078 --> 05:46.814
-You get 'em, girl!

05:46.847 --> 05:48.582
-Oh, man! Epic!
-Get 'em, that's my girl!

05:48.616 --> 05:49.750
What about you, Star?

05:49.783 --> 05:52.586
Well, I make
glordnorb pudding,

05:52.620 --> 05:55.756
with the saliva
of a giant klatar!

05:57.090 --> 05:58.125
Oh-ho-ho!

05:58.158 --> 06:00.861
I love giant klatars!

06:01.762 --> 06:03.063
RAVEN: That's how we roll.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.733
Cootie free!
We'll see about that.

06:30.023 --> 06:33.160
All right, you dirty cooties,
do your thing!

06:37.931 --> 06:40.133
CYBORG: Hey!
I'm trying to sleep!

06:40.167 --> 06:41.201
Sorry.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.473
CYBORG: I can still hear you.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.074
-Yes.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.614
Ugh, a boy!

06:53.647 --> 06:55.716
Ew! He smells.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.051
So, you boys
enjoying being girls?

06:58.085 --> 07:00.854
-It's the best!
-Girls rule!

07:00.888 --> 07:04.525
Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls!

07:04.558 --> 07:05.626
Are you done?

07:05.659 --> 07:08.028
G...g...g...g... Girls!

07:08.896 --> 07:11.231
Girls! Girls!

07:11.264 --> 07:15.969
G...g...g...g... Girls!
G...g...g...g... Girls!

07:18.238 --> 07:19.840
Something wrong?

07:19.873 --> 07:22.042
I do not feel alone
in my clothes.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.745
Yeah, my skin is crawling.

07:29.282 --> 07:33.754
Ooh, tsk-tsk-tsk.
Hmm, you know
what that sounds like.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.692
They're real! They're real!

07:38.726 --> 07:41.729
We do not have the cooties!

07:41.762 --> 07:42.896
-Oh!
-It's true,

07:42.930 --> 07:44.865
girls have cooties!

07:44.898 --> 07:46.867
We want to be boys again!

07:47.601 --> 07:49.136
You did this to us!

07:49.169 --> 07:52.472
Yes!
And I can undo it, with this!

07:54.274 --> 07:55.976
It's a cootie catcher.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.846
Oh, please,
give us the catcher
of the cooties!

07:58.879 --> 08:00.280
I'll be happy to,

08:00.313 --> 08:03.517
if you admit
that boys are better
than girls.

08:03.551 --> 08:04.317
Never!

08:04.351 --> 08:06.720
Then you're stuck
with cooties!

08:06.754 --> 08:10.558
You know, all we have to do
is touch you and you'll have
cooties too!

08:11.725 --> 08:13.594
Ahhh, cooties!

08:14.828 --> 08:16.597
But, Starfire touching me...

08:16.630 --> 08:18.165
Ahhh, cooties!

08:18.198 --> 08:21.268
Or the start
of a beautiful relationship.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.904
Ahhh, cooties! Run!

08:36.917 --> 08:38.018
Think we lost them?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.887
-Impossible!

08:39.920 --> 08:42.590
We have more of the endurance.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.700
Psst...

08:54.267 --> 08:57.170
Follow me, I know a place
they'll never find us.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.681
BEAST BOY: Shh!
We'll be safe in here.

09:07.715 --> 09:11.652
CYBORG: Ugh, safe, you know,
'cause we're in one.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.187
-RAVEN: We're smarter too!

09:15.823 --> 09:17.324
And we are the stronger.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.646
Now everyone
is having the cootie.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.982
So, you've got no choice
but to use the cootie catcher.

09:42.015 --> 09:45.285
You win. Again!

09:45.318 --> 09:48.188
And now the cooties
are caught.

09:59.132 --> 10:03.270
I am alone
in my clothes once more.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.839
Let's face it guys, the girls
are better than us.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.075
They're stronger,
faster, smarter.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.410
They're our superiors
in every way.

10:10.443 --> 10:16.216
We shouldn't let a day go by
without thanking them for even
noticing that we're alive.

10:16.249 --> 10:20.187
On behalf of all boys,
I want to apologize
for our actions.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.723
-Thank you, Robin.
-It's cool.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.091
But you know what, Robin?

10:24.124 --> 10:27.394
Only a boy can make
such an amazing speech!

10:27.427 --> 10:29.997
Boys rule!

10:30.030 --> 10:32.733
B...b...b... Boys!

10:32.766 --> 10:33.734
Please stop!
