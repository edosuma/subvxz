WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:03.032
Previously onSeaI Team...I injured my shoulder

00:03.090 --> 00:04.694
four months ago.
I also led my team leader

00:04.740 --> 00:06.082
to believe that
my shoulder was healed.

00:06.130 --> 00:07.301
And now there's a little boy
lying in the ground

00:07.350 --> 00:08.783
who shouldn't be there.

00:08.830 --> 00:11.048
One of your guys ended up
killing some local kid.

00:11.090 --> 00:13.046
I don't know anything about it.What if I told you

00:13.100 --> 00:15.489
Xeon may have been involved
in Echo Team's death?

00:15.530 --> 00:16.838
Involved how?

00:16.880 --> 00:20.054
Steve knew there was
lanthanum in that soil.

00:20.100 --> 00:22.148
Steve found traces only.

00:24.110 --> 00:25.498
CLAY:
Jason, can you hear me?

00:25.540 --> 00:27.326
The concussion's
got him a little loopy.

00:27.370 --> 00:28.325
JASON:
Your brother, Abad,

00:28.370 --> 00:29.496
made a deal with Cutter.

00:29.550 --> 00:31.199
Tell me where he is.Parachinar.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.708
Across the border.

00:35.730 --> 00:38.688
[heart beating,
faint high

00:41.080 --> 00:43.685
FIN|__EY:
Follow the light, please.

00:43.730 --> 00:46.073
And you never lost
consciousness?

00:46.130 --> 00:48.212
I told you already, no.

00:48.260 --> 00:50.125
And you remember
the whole incident?

00:50.180 --> 00:52.694
The crash.
No gaps at all?

00:52.740 --> 00:54.219
Yes, I remember
the whole thing.

00:54.270 --> 00:55.339
So, now, can I go?
'Cause I...

00:55.400 --> 00:56.526
I know, you told me.
You gotta get

00:56.570 --> 00:57.787
back out there
and finish this thing.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.398
And I told you

00:59.450 --> 01:01.054
you're not going anywhere
until I clear you.

01:01.100 --> 01:04.319
So walk me through
your memory of the crash.

01:06.190 --> 01:08.658
Okay, look,
there's this little alarm

01:08.720 --> 01:10.665
that's inside of the helo,
and it goes off

01:10.720 --> 01:12.142
when there's an anti-air missile
that locks on.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.849
So, the alarm goes off,

01:13.890 --> 01:15.448
and the pilot says, "Brace!"

01:15.510 --> 01:18.115
So, he takes the stick,
and he's jamming it around...

01:18.160 --> 01:20.469
and he saved our lives.

01:20.510 --> 01:21.852
And after the missile hit?

01:21.900 --> 01:23.299
Must have hit
the tail rotor,

01:23.340 --> 01:25.205
'cause the chopper just
started spinning around.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.774
Then, bam, we go down,
the bird breaks in half.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.037
My leg,

01:28.080 --> 01:29.422
it gets busted up.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.469
The pilot's dead,

01:30.520 --> 01:31.862
her comms are out,
and, uh,

01:31.910 --> 01:35.129
well, we get out alive.

01:35.180 --> 01:36.659
Anything else
you need to know?

01:36.700 --> 01:39.430
And when you replay
the incident,

01:39.490 --> 01:40.969
there are no black spots--

01:41.010 --> 01:42.830
no places where
the film goes blank?

01:42.880 --> 01:44.700
No.

01:44.750 --> 01:49.312
Well, I would definitely say
you've got a concussion.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.440
But your cognitive
and motor functions

01:51.500 --> 01:52.626
seem unaffected.

01:52.670 --> 01:54.149
And your memory's intact

01:54.200 --> 01:56.236
both immediately before
and since the incident.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.713
So I have no reason
to take you out of action.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.249
See ya.Which doesn't mean

02:00.290 --> 02:02.326
I wouldn't suggest
you take it easy a few days.

02:02.380 --> 02:04.200
You've had a serious
head injury.

02:05.900 --> 02:08.039
A doctor's only as good
as her patient.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.854
You think he's lying
about his symptoms?

02:09.910 --> 02:12.162
You're his friend.
You tell me.

02:12.210 --> 02:13.996
Thanks, Doc.

02:14.040 --> 02:14.995
You're welcome.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.644
Take it easy.

02:21.570 --> 02:23.697
JASON: Ray, look,
there's something I want to...

02:23.750 --> 02:25.354
Well, there's something
I wanted to say

02:25.400 --> 02:26.788
in front of the doctor,
but I didn't.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.000
I knew it.
I knew it.

02:28.060 --> 02:29.004
Jason, if your
head's messed up...

02:29.060 --> 02:31.051
It's not about my head.

02:31.100 --> 02:32.624
Then what's it about?It's about Alan Cutter.

02:32.670 --> 02:35.013
Come on, man, not this again.Listen,

02:35.060 --> 02:38.018
he made a deal
with Abad Halani.

02:38.070 --> 02:39.276
You told me that already.

02:39.330 --> 02:41.321
Yeah, and Nouri Halani
confirmed it.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.190
Nouri Halani's_deathbed
confe55ion,

02:43.250 --> 02:46.060
that no one else heard,
confirms your insane theory?

02:46.120 --> 02:47.337
You know what,
I know it sounds crazy, but...

02:47.380 --> 02:48.813
Do you?
Yeah.

02:48.860 --> 02:50.111
'Cause you're saying
one of the biggest

02:50.170 --> 02:52.115
military contracting
companies in this country

02:52.170 --> 02:53.853
is in bed with _
a terrorist organization.

02:53.910 --> 02:57.550
That's exactly what I'm saying.
That's exactly what I'm saying.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.828
Well, who else knows
about this?

02:59.870 --> 03:02.384
I told Mandy
bits and pieces.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.476
You told Mandy,
but you didn't tell me?

03:04.530 --> 03:07.488
Bits and pieces.

03:07.530 --> 03:09.304
All right?
And Amy.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.611
Yeah, I figured as much.

03:10.660 --> 03:11.831
All right, look,
You know what, Ray,

03:11.880 --> 03:13.313
I should have told you,
but I didn't, okay?

03:13.360 --> 03:16.488
Sorry, but...

03:16.540 --> 03:18.849
JASON: What's wrong?
Why are you pulling over?

03:18.890 --> 03:21.108
RAY: 'Cause there's something
I ought to tell you.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.799
What?
It's about my shoulder.

03:24.850 --> 03:28.638
Ray, look, I know your
shoulder's not 100%.

03:28.680 --> 03:29.851
It's more than that.

03:29.900 --> 03:32.892
It's about the kid
in J-Bad that got killed

03:32.950 --> 03:35.032
from my grenade when it--
when I threw it short.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.071
My shoulder, Jace,

03:37.120 --> 03:42.513
I... I told you that
I was all good,

03:42.570 --> 03:45.209
that the doc checked me,
cleared me for deployment.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.058
What was the first rule
Adam used to tell the new guys

03:55.100 --> 03:56.829
when they got to Bravo Team,
huh, Ray?

03:56.880 --> 04:00.793
Never lie to your team leader.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.851
DAVIS: We are looking
at a fortified bunker

04:14.900 --> 04:17.630
above Parachinar, on the
Pakistan side of Tora Bora.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.329
You sure that's where Nouri said
Abad would be holed up?

04:20.390 --> 04:22.199
Yeah. Why?

04:22.260 --> 04:24.069
His bunker's built
into a mountain.

04:24.130 --> 04:26.212
I don't want to send you
in there unless we have to.

04:26.260 --> 04:27.773
Is this gonna be a problem?

04:27.830 --> 04:29.218
ERIC:
Shouldn't be.

04:29.260 --> 04:30.739
The brass understands
that we have a chance

04:30.790 --> 04:32.564
to take out the entire
Halani network.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.827
Short of starting a war
with Pakistan,

04:34.880 --> 04:37.223
Command will be on board with
whatever it takes to get Abad.

04:37.270 --> 04:38.828
JASON: Great. Sun goes down
in a few hours.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.577
Puts us Parachinar in what,
9:00, 9:30, right?

04:45.150 --> 04:47.493
So, what are we missing?

04:47.540 --> 04:48.620
Well, surveillance shows that

04:48.670 --> 04:49.887
Nouri's men are
already regrouping.

04:49.940 --> 04:51.328
MANDY:
With Nouri dead.

04:51.370 --> 04:52.894
we assume most
of them are gonna

04:52.940 --> 04:54.328
pledge allegiance to Abad.

04:54.380 --> 04:56.598
But there will be
some holdouts who

04:56.640 --> 04:58.858
feel like the only way
to preserve their honor is

04:58.900 --> 05:00.242
to avenge Nouri's death.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.985
Those guys are gonna
go after Abad.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.723
If you don't get there
before they do...

05:04.780 --> 05:06.429
We're liable to end up
right in the middle of

05:06.480 --> 05:07.947
a real brother-againstâ€”brother
blood feud.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.774
JASON: So, like I said,
send those down,

05:09.830 --> 05:11.604
we go.

05:11.650 --> 05:13.914
Hey, hey.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.564
I hear when
you grabbed Nouri,

05:15.610 --> 05:17.305
you started yelling
at him about Cutter,

05:17.360 --> 05:19.487
tried to get him to tell you
how they knew each other.

05:21.050 --> 05:23.792
Yeah. So?Okay, so can I assume

05:23.840 --> 05:26.013
that when Nouri was dying,
you asked him again?

05:28.670 --> 05:30.319
There's something I gotta do
before we go down this road.

05:30.370 --> 05:32.361
Hey, if we keep
investigating Cutter,

05:32.410 --> 05:33.365
you're gonna be
putting your girlfriend

05:33.420 --> 05:35.490
in a really
tight position.

05:35.550 --> 05:37.108
Not just her.

05:37.160 --> 05:38.718
It looks like
someone tipped her off.

05:38.770 --> 05:40.499
And that someone could be

05:40.550 --> 05:42.984
up for a dishonorable
discharge.

05:43.030 --> 05:44.634
Even time in Leavenworth.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.115
I gotta go take care
of something.

05:47.170 --> 05:49.035
I'll be back soon.

05:53.740 --> 05:56.868
Hi...

05:56.920 --> 05:58.603
Listen, I just want to say
that I'm not okay

05:58.660 --> 06:01.436
with the way that--

06:01.490 --> 06:04.448
Hey... I need you to pack.
You understand me?

06:07.450 --> 06:08.667
Why am I packing?

06:08.710 --> 06:10.530
Because you're leaving,
that's why.

06:26.340 --> 06:28.763
What up, Superbad?

06:30.730 --> 06:31.719
CLAY: Are we going out
again tonight?

06:31.780 --> 06:33.338
Yep.
Nice.

06:33.390 --> 06:35.085
Abad Halani gets
a head start,

06:35.130 --> 06:36.563
decides to leave the mountains,

06:36.610 --> 06:38.646
we will never catch him.I could definitely use

06:38.700 --> 06:41.123
a few more hours' sleep.
that's for damn sure.

06:41.180 --> 06:43.740
I could have just used one.

06:43.790 --> 06:45.394
Oh, wait, let me guess.
Stella?

06:45.440 --> 06:47.488
Yeah. I haven't been able to
reach her the last few days.

06:47.530 --> 06:49.088
Kind of gives
the imagination

06:49.140 --> 06:50.835
some time to run wild,
you know?

06:50.880 --> 06:52.529
Yeah, you're telling me.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.276
That big hunk of meat Danny
not call you back?

06:57.670 --> 06:59.012
Yeah, I'm thinking I'm gonna
have to give that one

06:59.070 --> 07:00.196
a little bit of a rest.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.368
Look. He's probably nervous.

07:03.420 --> 07:05.980
Big thing seeing someone
after three months, you know.

07:06.030 --> 07:07.463
I mean, even if you love 'em.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.727
Especially if you do.

07:08.770 --> 07:10.635
If-If you get back,

07:10.690 --> 07:12.555
and you need somebody
to talk to, I'm here.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.251
Thank you, but I think
you're gonna be

07:15.300 --> 07:17.473
pretty occupied.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.648
I don't know.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.827
Maybe I should give that
a rest, too.

07:22.870 --> 07:24.918
Okay...
this whole...

07:24.960 --> 07:27.872
Oprah DeGeneres
mutual support thing

07:27.920 --> 07:31.742
is make this rather
narrow space p05itively

07:31.790 --> 07:33.098
confining.

07:33.140 --> 07:34.698
All right,
if you'll forgive me...

07:34.750 --> 07:36.706
Never.I'm out.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.705
DAVIS:
Bye.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.753
This feel right to you?

07:43.810 --> 07:46.495
What, voluntarily
getting on a helicopter

07:46.550 --> 07:48.108
after watching one
get shot down?

07:48.160 --> 07:50.594
Not that. Abad.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.949
I mean, the guy's been
playing chess this whole time.

07:52.990 --> 07:54.423
He's been five moves ahead.

07:54.470 --> 07:56.370
Right? Suddenly
he's at checkmate?

07:56.430 --> 07:57.772
Got his brother
out of the picture,

07:57.820 --> 07:59.469
and now he's gonna...
he's gonna hole up

07:59.520 --> 08:01.169
somewhere Nouri's guys
know about?

08:01.210 --> 08:03.349
He's not worried they're gonna
come looking for some payback?

08:03.390 --> 08:06.826
Man, the fact is
ISR confirms he's there.

08:28.590 --> 08:32.026
Hey, let's go.

08:49.260 --> 08:51.911
TOC, this is Bravo 1.
We're holding Goldfinger.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.348
JASON :
300 yards from the bunker.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.652
Copy that. Our ISR footage
is still out,

08:55.700 --> 08:57.748
so for now we're in the blind.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.196
JASON : Bravo 2,
tell me what you see.

09:14.070 --> 09:19.281
RAY:
I count one... two... three...

09:19.340 --> 09:22.810
Five sentries,
including a machine guns nest

09:22.860 --> 09:24.851
guarding the main entrance.

09:24.910 --> 09:26.901
Seems like you probably
beat Nouri's guys there,

09:26.950 --> 09:29.123
but we_ won't know_for sure
until we get a Visual.

09:29.170 --> 09:31.775
Copy that. Let me know
when you have eyes.

09:33.260 --> 09:36.559
Hey.
Hey, boss.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.521
I say we set up
sniper overwatch,

09:38.570 --> 09:40.743
take out the big guns.

09:40.790 --> 09:42.746
Yeah, you're right.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.746
Ray and I can-- we can
perch up over there.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.609
All right, go set it.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.792
TOC, this is Bravo 1.
Moving to Blofeld.

09:58.810 --> 09:59.936
Get down!
Down!

10:02.160 --> 10:04.811
JASON:
Where the hell'd that come from?

10:04.860 --> 10:07.328
Okay, all positions hold
what you got.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.644
JASON:
Somebody talk to me.

10:09.690 --> 10:11.681
CLAY:
H see 'em.

10:11.740 --> 10:16.348
AK fire over here
on the southeast.

10:16.390 --> 10:21.430
RAY: Boss, I don't think
they're shooting at us.

10:21.490 --> 10:24.095
It looks like it's all
directed towards the target.

10:24.140 --> 10:27.007
Bravo 1, give me a sitrep.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.789
Sir, it looks like Nouri's guys
got here after all.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.569
They're engaging Abad's men
from the southeast.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.699
Are you taking fire?

10:31.760 --> 10:33.273
JASON:
Negahve.

10:33.320 --> 10:35.106
I don't think
they know we're here.

10:37.330 --> 10:39.286
Holy crossfire, Batman.

10:44.860 --> 10:46.725
Roger, Bravo 1.

10:46.770 --> 10:48.374
ISR feed is
back online.

10:48.430 --> 10:49.943
Hold your position for now.

10:49.990 --> 10:52.379
JASON: Okay, boys, looks like
we have 50-yard-line seats

10:52.430 --> 10:55.160
to a real-life Family Feud.

11:09.840 --> 11:14.448
So what, boss? Let these guys

11:14.490 --> 11:15.752
keep firing,
kill each other?

11:15.800 --> 11:18.143
Let these guys shoot it out.

11:18.190 --> 11:20.841
Well, what if Abad and his guys
end up on top?

11:20.890 --> 11:22.198
We'll move on them then,

11:22.240 --> 11:23.935
after Nouri's guys
soften them up a little.

11:23.980 --> 11:26.858
Unless Abad uses the chaos
to slip out again.

11:26.900 --> 11:29.801
We got a chance to end this
thing tonight. I say we take it.

11:29.860 --> 11:31.555
We can't exactly walk
in the front door.

11:33.170 --> 11:36.389
There's got to be a ventilation
shaft in those bunkers.

11:36.430 --> 11:37.863
All right, so I tell you what,

11:37.910 --> 11:39.343
we'll slip in
through the back door

11:39.390 --> 11:41.381
while the Hatfields and McCoys,
they battle it out.

11:41.430 --> 11:42.772
Let Nouri's guys
be our cover element,

11:42.830 --> 11:44.081
even if they don't know it.

11:44.130 --> 11:46.086
Ray, you and Brock,
you stay here.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.301
Copy that.

12:15.380 --> 12:17.166
Bingo.

13:53.440 --> 13:56.739
Bravo 4, hold what you got.
Do not breach the gate.

13:56.790 --> 13:58.917
I say again,
do not breach the gate.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.655
Why?

14:00.700 --> 14:03.965
It's rigged.
This whole bunker, maybe.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.568
Rigged how?

14:05.620 --> 14:08.088
I can see a bunch of wires
running through the hinges.

14:08.150 --> 14:09.833
Sit tight. Check it.

14:14.630 --> 14:15.756
Yeah, this one's rigged, too.

14:15.810 --> 14:17.493
All call signs, avalanche.

14:17.550 --> 14:19.279
I repeat, say again, avalanche.

14:19.330 --> 14:21.855
Regroup at the
rally point.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.768
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.299
The mountain's rigged.

14:26.340 --> 14:28.205
Abad is looking to take out
whoever makes it in here.

14:28.250 --> 14:30.389
Roger, Bravo 1.
Wait one.

14:30.430 --> 14:31.738
Abad's got the place wired.

14:31.780 --> 14:34.032
It's pretty smart.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.569
Wait for Nouri's guys
to take the bunker,

14:35.610 --> 14:37.305
and then bring it right down
on top of them.

14:37.350 --> 14:39.784
Just like he did with Echo Team.MANDY:
Abad's not an idiot.

14:39.830 --> 14:43.561
He knows his brother's hardcore
followers will show up here.

14:43.620 --> 14:46.487
He figures he can take them
all out at once,

14:46.530 --> 14:48.134
end the Halani civil war
before it starts.

14:48.190 --> 14:49.578
It's a_ shame _
we can't just let him.

14:49.620 --> 14:51.099
Maybe we can.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.971
All right, listen up.

15:00.020 --> 15:02.932
New plan, all right? Stay here,

15:02.980 --> 15:04.413
watch these idiots
kill each other,

15:04.460 --> 15:06.155
then we're gonna
go get Abad. Got it?

15:06.200 --> 15:07.849
SONNY: See?
Sometimes I feel like

15:07.900 --> 15:10.721
I'm the only one that knows
how to have a good time.

15:10.770 --> 15:13.853
We're going to 50% security,
I'm racking out.

15:13.910 --> 15:16.378
Wake me when it's over.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.928
JASON: Okay, here we go.
They're heading inside.

15:33.970 --> 15:36.575
Let's go, guys. Get up.
Wake up. Let's move.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.400
TOC.

15:42.460 --> 15:45.759
This is Bravo 1.
Still have ISR up?

15:45.810 --> 15:47.539
Roger, you are
good to go.

15:47.590 --> 15:49.239
We're keeping our eyes
peeled for squirters.

15:49.290 --> 15:50.678
All right, look,
as far as we can see

15:50.730 --> 15:52.812
all of Nouri's guys are inside.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.851
If Abad is watching,
this whole place is gonna go...

16:02.700 --> 16:04.918
DAVIS: If Abad's in there,
he should be on the move.

16:09.750 --> 16:10.967
There, there.

16:11.010 --> 16:12.136
All Bravo call signs,
be advised,

16:12.180 --> 16:13.442
you've got
three squirters,

16:13.490 --> 16:14.969
200 meters east of your
position, moving north.

16:40.690 --> 16:41.907
JASON:
Come on!

16:49.570 --> 16:52.038
Abad, easy.

16:52.090 --> 16:54.172
Tell your men to
put their guns down.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.407
Damn it.

17:05.450 --> 17:08.328
Hey.

17:08.370 --> 17:09.974
Hey, get up here.

17:10.020 --> 17:12.329
Hey! You made a deal
with Cutter. Huh?

17:12.370 --> 17:14.190
You made a deal with Cutter.
What was the deal?

17:16.550 --> 17:18.677
What was the deal?

17:28.000 --> 17:32.300
Smile. Steve Porter says hi.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.261
Send it.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.019
Good work.

17:56.070 --> 17:57.628
Thank you.Nice work, guys.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.159
Welcome back. Welcome home.

18:01.290 --> 18:04.248
Glad you're back safe and sound.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.770
All right, listen up, everybody.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.085
I know we had this
celebration once before,

18:11.130 --> 18:14.600
thinking we got some payback for
what happened to the Echo guys,

18:14.650 --> 18:16.254
but this time we
finally earned it.

18:16.310 --> 18:19.040
Not only did
we bring justice

18:19.090 --> 18:21.263
to the killers
who set up our team,

18:21.310 --> 18:24.575
but we also took down
the Halani brothers.

18:24.620 --> 18:26.611
And that is the biggest victory

18:26.670 --> 18:28.444
we've had in this place
in years.

18:28.490 --> 18:32.051
You should all be very
proud of yourselves.

18:32.110 --> 18:33.975
The list that you
asked me to get,

18:34.020 --> 18:36.363
the rundown of all the things
that were shipped back home

18:36.410 --> 18:37.581
by Mortuary Affairs
for Steve,

18:37.630 --> 18:39.063
you looking for anything
in particular?

18:39.110 --> 18:40.975
Hoping I know it when I see it.

18:41.030 --> 18:41.985
Yeah, I thought
you might say that.

18:42.030 --> 18:43.509
What do you got?

18:43.550 --> 18:45.336
Well, this is a list
of everything

18:45.380 --> 18:46.859
that should've
been shipped home.

18:46.900 --> 18:48.982
On 11/2, he ordered
an external hard drive.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.769
It was not shipped home.

18:50.820 --> 18:53.163
External hard drive,
you think that's something

18:53.210 --> 18:54.552
maybe he could've
taken on his ops,

18:54.610 --> 18:56.032
maybe it got destroyed
or something?

18:56.090 --> 18:57.990
Maybe. But I think that you
think that it's still here,

18:58.040 --> 19:00.952
and I think that you're about
to ask me to help you find it,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.434
which means it's time for you
to tell me what's going on.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.697
Yeah.Yeah, I second that.

19:05.750 --> 19:09.868
Okay. Let's go have a
talk over here. Come on.

19:09.930 --> 19:11.352
ERIC: None of us
should ever forget

19:11.410 --> 19:13.184
the risk those
helo guys take

19:13.230 --> 19:17.496
getting us in and out
of places we go.

19:17.540 --> 19:19.804
And you knew
all of this?

19:19.850 --> 19:21.624
Parts of it.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.363
Look, this doesn't
necessarily mean

19:23.420 --> 19:26.025
that Cutter was in on
the hit on Echo Team.

19:26.070 --> 19:30.074
It's possible he just told Abad
that Steve could expose them

19:30.120 --> 19:31.849
and Abad decided to take
him out on his own.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.686
Even then, it means Cutter's
been covering for him.

19:33.730 --> 19:35.516
Well, either way,
Cutter's got to pay.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.778
Question is, how do we
make that happen?

19:37.820 --> 19:40.562
Will Amy testify?

19:40.610 --> 19:42.339
She doesn't know anything.

19:42.390 --> 19:45.211
How about I get her in a room
and find out for sure?

19:45.270 --> 19:47.659
You know what? She's gone.

19:47.700 --> 19:50.703
I hope to hell you know
what you're doing.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.051
All right.

19:55.100 --> 19:56.795
Let's find
a hard drive.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.182
Where do we start?

19:58.240 --> 19:59.889
His hooch,
the gear tent.

19:59.930 --> 20:02.012
No, no, it's not gonna
be in his hooch.

20:02.070 --> 20:05.233
I knew Steve. He wouldn't
put it somewhere ObVlOUS.

20:05.290 --> 20:09.329
He'd put it
somewhere that--

20:11.210 --> 20:13.201
Think I know where it is.

20:23.350 --> 20:25.306
Hey.

20:31.790 --> 20:34.008
If this ends up being
sightseeing photos

20:34.050 --> 20:36.701
or music downloads, we're all
gonna feel pretty stupid.

20:38.620 --> 20:41.088
MANDY: These are deeds
of sale, farms.

20:41.150 --> 20:43.015
We've seen some
of this stuff before.

20:43.060 --> 20:44.584
Yeah, but not
all of them.

20:44.630 --> 20:46.882
Paul told me the guy
at the Hall of Records

20:46.940 --> 20:49.238
said another Westerner
had been in there recently.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.678
Just assumed it was
another reporter.

20:50.720 --> 20:54.019
JASON: You got to
be kidding me.

20:54.070 --> 20:56.026
Wow. Steve got a lot farther
than I did.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.079
BROCK: Yeah,
one more, buddy.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.519
Looking good, man.

21:02.560 --> 21:05.643
25.0h, yeah, bud.

21:05.690 --> 21:07.646
That's some old man strength
right there.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.861
Yeah, good set,
old man.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.172
ERIC: What's up, fellas

21:12.220 --> 21:15.132
What's going on, Blackburn?

21:15.180 --> 21:16.613
Get a word with you?

21:16.660 --> 21:18.446
Yeah, yeah.

21:18.490 --> 21:21.277
You, uh, asked me
to talk to some people,

21:21.320 --> 21:24.665
see if I could track down
Danny Cooper?

21:24.710 --> 21:27.270
He's in the VA
hospital in Hampton.

21:30.890 --> 21:34.678
Uh, Danny's a civilian now,
so his records are private.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.984
Couldn't get the nurse to say
much, but from what I could

21:37.030 --> 21:39.544
put together, the Virginia
Beach cops found him in his car

21:39.600 --> 21:41.374
with a needle in his arm.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.909
Son of a bitch.

21:42.950 --> 21:45.908
Yeah, well, if you
don't mind me saying,

21:45.950 --> 21:48.339
that's not the compassionate
response I was expecting.

21:48.390 --> 21:52.258
Yeah, I don't mean him, I just
mean this whole damn situation.

21:54.790 --> 21:56.781
What in the hell
am I gonna tell Davis?

21:56.830 --> 22:00.573
Well, you can always
try telling the truth.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.316
It's the easiest
thing to remember.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.108
LEE: M_r. Cutter is
currently in a meeting,

22:10.150 --> 22:11.401
you can't just go
in there-- Sir!

22:11.460 --> 22:13.109
Excuse me, sir!

22:13.150 --> 22:14.754
I am so sorry, Mr. Cutter,
I told him...

22:14.810 --> 22:17.324
No, no, no, it's quite
all right, Ms. Lee.

22:17.370 --> 22:20.157
Actually, you know,
I'm happy to have the chance

22:20.200 --> 22:24.637
to shake the hand of the man
who shot Abad Halani.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.649
LEE: I'll call security.No, there's...
there's no need.

22:30.690 --> 22:33.295
Just please, uh,
shut the door behind you.

22:33.350 --> 22:36.478
I heard you suffered
quite a nasty...

22:36.520 --> 22:38.124
nasty bang to the head.

22:38.180 --> 22:42.139
I'm happy to see
you're none the worse for wear.

22:42.180 --> 22:43.829
You want to explain those?

22:43.880 --> 22:46.007
Well, I'd rather wait until
you to tell me what they are.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.961
Deeds, geology reports, photos.
Put that all together,

22:49.010 --> 22:50.750
shows that you made
a deal with Abad Halani.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.017
Ah.

22:52.060 --> 22:53.140
Got your guys to burn
those poppy fields,

22:53.190 --> 22:55.055
so you can get
the land on the cheap.

22:55.110 --> 22:58.329
To mine a trillion dollars
in lanthanum?

22:58.370 --> 22:59.758
And you're admitting it

22:59.810 --> 23:01.232
Obviously not.

23:01.290 --> 23:03.246
Look, we've been
through this, Jason.

23:03.290 --> 23:05.542
There is no lanthanum here,
we looked.

23:05.600 --> 23:06.817
Maybe there is,
maybe there isn't.

23:06.860 --> 23:08.282
But you made a deal with Abad.

23:08.340 --> 23:09.762
Halani's a terrorist.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.333
It would've been a crime for me
to make a deal with him.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.335
And if those papers proved
anything like that,

23:13.390 --> 23:15.779
you'd have walked in here
with the FBI.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.868
Look, you're not
totally wrong

23:17.910 --> 23:19.127
_ about what's
gomg on here, Jason.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.216
You just got the wrong guy.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.560
It's a new Great Game

23:23.610 --> 23:25.521
here in the land of the Pashtun.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.879
There's a lot of players,
there's a lot of big players,

23:27.920 --> 23:30.309
because someday soon,
when electric cars

23:30.360 --> 23:33.318
are the only ones anyone will
make, lanthanum is gonna be

23:33.360 --> 23:35.703
more valuable than gasoline.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.842
Wow, when you put it that way,
I guess killing

23:37.890 --> 23:41.326
six American operators, that's
just a small price to pay.

23:41.370 --> 23:44.328
First, obviously,
I didn't kill anybody.

23:44.370 --> 23:46.850
Second, I just told you
that one day,

23:46.900 --> 23:49.767
lanthanum is gonna be
more valuable than oil.

23:49.810 --> 23:51.858
And how many men have died
to keep thatflowing?

23:51.900 --> 23:53.856
Hey.

23:53.910 --> 23:56.993
You're going down.

23:57.040 --> 24:00.032
You know,
you're a good operator.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.081
Yeah, you're committed.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.605
It's a pity
I can't offer you a job.

24:08.350 --> 24:11.706
Security's...CU'l'|'ER: Everything is fine,
Ms. Lee, thank you.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.183
Uh, Master Chief Hayes

24:13.230 --> 24:14.481
was just leaving.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.007
Oh, and by the way, Ms. Lee,

24:16.060 --> 24:17.664
would you mind
calling Amy Nelson

24:17.710 --> 24:19.530
for me, have her come see me?

24:19.580 --> 24:20.717
LEE:
Absolutely.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.365
Good luck trying to find her.

24:25.680 --> 24:27.898
You know what, Jason?

24:27.940 --> 24:29.544
Did you ever really
think about

24:29.590 --> 24:32.150
_ _ how much _
a trillion dollars actually is?

24:32.200 --> 24:33.724
A man once told me
the difference

24:33.770 --> 24:35.818
between a_ millionaire
and a billionaire:

24:35.860 --> 24:37.816
a million seconds

24:37.860 --> 24:40.385
is 12 days,
a billion seconds

24:40.430 --> 24:43.558
is 34 years.

24:43.610 --> 24:46.033
And a trillion
seconds ago,

24:46.090 --> 24:49.082
there were still mastodons
in North America.

24:50.880 --> 24:55.704
War is hell, sure,
but it's also opportunity.

24:57.190 --> 24:59.181
Right.

25:02.320 --> 25:04.311
You're going down, bud.

25:13.590 --> 25:15.546
Yeah.

25:18.380 --> 25:20.940
So I take it Cutter
didn't go for it?

25:20.990 --> 25:23.868
No, it was a waste of time.

25:23.910 --> 25:27.380
Okay, so we didn't get him
to admit to it on tape, so what?

25:27.430 --> 25:29.159
We have other moves.

25:29.220 --> 25:31.120
No, not those moves--
what, the FBI?

25:31.180 --> 25:33.956
I mean, that was
our plan B.

25:34.010 --> 25:35.523
Cutter's too smart
for the FBI, not gonna work.

25:35.570 --> 25:37.299
Okay, so what's
your alternative?

25:37.360 --> 25:39.965
Oh, my alternative? I'm
working on that as we speak.

25:40.010 --> 25:42.968
Davis told me that you asked
for a map of the main base,

25:43.010 --> 25:44.147
and wouldn't
tell her why.

25:44.190 --> 25:45.703
Mm-hmm.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.660
Jason, you can't
just murder Cutter.

25:47.720 --> 25:48.971
Why the hell not, right?

25:49.020 --> 25:50.499
We're at war, he's the enemy.

25:50.540 --> 25:51.359
You kill Cutter,

25:51.410 --> 25:52.411
you're not gonna stop Xeon,

25:52.460 --> 25:53.620
you're just gonna
ruin your life.

25:53.680 --> 25:54.669
I don't care
about my life.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.371
Well, I do.

25:57.420 --> 26:02.198
I blow his head off,
Echo boys, they rest in peace.

26:02.250 --> 26:03.763
That's all I know.

26:03.820 --> 26:06.038
I hear you.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.607
But Jason, the people
behind Cutter.

26:09.650 --> 26:12.255
The big money, in
Washington, London,

26:12.300 --> 26:14.780
Frankfurt. Islamabad.

26:14.830 --> 26:17.264
The people who stand
to gain from all of this war,

26:17.310 --> 26:18.823
they can't be
stopped with a gun.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.780
How

26:27.840 --> 26:29.888
I wasn't sure
you'd show.

26:29.930 --> 26:33.195
Neither was I.

26:33.240 --> 26:35.196
So you want to tell me
why you got me out here?

26:35.240 --> 26:36.719
Is this gonna be our
relationship from now on?

26:36.760 --> 26:38.409
It appears so.

26:38.460 --> 26:40.325
Is there anything
I can do about that?

26:40.380 --> 26:42.678
Nothing comes to mind.

26:42.730 --> 26:45.767
You know, I'm actually up
against a deadline, so if we

26:45.820 --> 26:48.288
could make this quick...Oh, would that be
your big expos on, uh,

26:48.340 --> 26:52.333
evil American operators who,
despite taking every precaution,

26:52.390 --> 26:53.948
accidentally killed
a local kid?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.649
If you're trying
to talk me out of the story,

26:55.700 --> 26:57.645
making fun of it
is really not the way.

26:59.740 --> 27:02.208
What if I gave you
a bigger story?

27:02.270 --> 27:04.090
Hmm.

27:04.140 --> 27:07.268
The last time you gave me a
story, it turned out to be a lie

27:07.320 --> 27:08.742
intended to further
your own interests.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.279
Well, what are
the chances

27:10.320 --> 27:12.788
I'd be stupid enough
to try that again?

27:14.980 --> 27:17.619
This one's true. I can prove it.

27:17.670 --> 27:21.413
I've got maps, photos,
internal company documents.

27:21.460 --> 27:23.633
What company?

27:23.680 --> 27:25.068
First, you have
to promise

27:25.120 --> 27:26.508
you're gonna drop
the other story.

27:28.860 --> 27:30.816
All right.

27:30.860 --> 27:35.331
If your news story
is big enough,

27:35.390 --> 27:37.904
I'll drop the one I'm writing
about the dead kid.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.303
If I give you what I got,

27:40.350 --> 27:42.910
how do I know you're not just
gonna run with both stories?

27:42.960 --> 27:45.827
I guess you're just gonna
have to trust me.

27:45.880 --> 27:49.350
How much do you know
about Alan Cutter?

27:53.750 --> 27:57.538
JASON: Drinking alone, now
that is a slippery slope, Ray.

27:57.580 --> 28:00.936
Well, then, good thing
you're here to s...

28:00.980 --> 28:02.754
save me from it.

28:02.810 --> 28:05.028
You ready to tell me what
you've been running around on

28:05.070 --> 28:07.026
since we got
back from Abad?

28:07.070 --> 28:09.197
You, Mandy and Davis?

28:09.250 --> 28:11.889
I think you can guess.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.505
Cutter?

28:15.560 --> 28:17.516
Yeah.

28:17.560 --> 28:19.608
You know, I could
help you with that.

28:19.650 --> 28:21.470
Cutter's too dangerous.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.078
He's the kind of guy
who'll use your wife and kids

28:23.130 --> 28:24.688
to come after you, and I...

28:24.740 --> 28:26.731
I got to keep you
far away from that.

28:26.790 --> 28:29.748
That's why you don't
want me on it?

28:29.790 --> 28:32.258
To protect Naima and the kids?

28:32.310 --> 28:35.006
You lied to me, Ray.

28:35.060 --> 28:38.279
You lied to the team,
put us all at risk.

28:38.320 --> 28:41.881
Yes, I did.

28:41.930 --> 28:43.978
And I owned up to it.

28:44.020 --> 28:46.625
Oh, so you want credit for that?

28:46.680 --> 28:47.715
Look, brother, I messed up.

28:47.760 --> 28:48.897
Yeah, you did.

28:48.940 --> 28:50.669
I couldn't miss deployment,

28:50.720 --> 28:53.541
and H thought I could
work around the shoulder.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.775
So where does that leave us?

28:59.820 --> 29:03.074
Leaves us right here,
12, 13 hours before we board

29:03.130 --> 29:06.770
that-that freedom bird
to get home.

29:06.830 --> 29:08.513
What about after that?

29:08.570 --> 29:11.471
Well, first of all, you're gonna
get that shoulder surgery

29:11.530 --> 29:13.009
you're saying
that you don't need.

29:13.050 --> 29:16.269
Second, uh, you're go, uh,
teach at Green Team

29:16.310 --> 29:17.186
while you're rehabbing.

29:17.230 --> 29:19.448
That's a good idea.

29:21.020 --> 29:22.089
Teach at Green Team?

29:22.150 --> 29:23.799
Adam will love
to have you.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.444
Besides, you're got to put in
your instructor time

29:25.500 --> 29:28.105
before, uh, Command will even
give you your own team.

29:28.150 --> 29:32.154
Means I'll be off of Bravo
for a few months.Mm-hmm.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.668
Sure I'm-a have
a spot to come back to?

29:34.720 --> 29:36.597
We'll talk about that
when the time is right.

29:40.560 --> 29:44.030
We, uh, also gonna talk about
what's not wrong with your head?

29:48.780 --> 29:50.771
Ha.

29:58.270 --> 30:01.706
Mama told me

30:01.750 --> 30:05.959
When I was young

30:06.020 --> 30:09.842
Come sit beside me

30:09.890 --> 30:12.233
My only son

30:13.940 --> 30:17.842
And listen closely

30:17.900 --> 30:21.768
To what I say

30:21.820 --> 30:24.243
And if you do this

30:24.300 --> 30:26.336
It'll help you

30:26.380 --> 30:28.769
Some sunny day

30:28.820 --> 30:30.811
Oh, yeah

30:46.320 --> 30:50.620
Oh, take your time

30:50.670 --> 30:54.231
Don't live too fast

30:54.280 --> 30:58.364
Troubles will come

30:58.420 --> 31:02.288
And they will pass

31:02.330 --> 31:04.469
You'll find a woman

31:04.510 --> 31:06.501
And you'll

31:06.560 --> 31:10.337
And you'll find love

31:10.390 --> 31:12.460
And don't forget, son

31:12.520 --> 31:14.647
There is someone

31:14.690 --> 31:18.478
Up above

31:18.520 --> 31:22.308
And be a simple

31:22.350 --> 31:25.968
Kind of man

31:26.010 --> 31:29.969
Oh, be something

31:30.010 --> 31:34.140
You love and understand

31:34.190 --> 31:37.842
Baby, be a simple

31:37.890 --> 31:42.361
Kind of man

31:42.420 --> 31:46.197
Oh, won't you do this
for me, son

31:46.250 --> 31:47.467
If you can

31:50.600 --> 31:54.388
And be a simple

31:54.430 --> 31:56.648
Kind of man

31:58.300 --> 32:01.474
Oh, be something

32:01.520 --> 32:05.877
You love and understand

32:05.920 --> 32:08.821
Baby, be a simple

32:08.880 --> 32:10.438
Kind of man...

32:24.940 --> 32:26.669
See you.Have a good one.

32:39.300 --> 32:40.688
Daddy!

32:42.090 --> 32:43.819
Oh, hey, baby girl.

32:43.870 --> 32:45.428
Daddy missed you so much.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.436
I missed you, too.Yeah

32:47.480 --> 32:49.653
Come on.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.656
You did

32:51.700 --> 32:52.871
You did?Yes.

32:52.920 --> 32:54.524
Yeah?Uh-huh.

32:54.580 --> 32:55.877
You look great.

32:55.930 --> 32:57.181
Look at you!

32:57.230 --> 32:59.482
I prefer the
view from over here.

32:59.540 --> 33:00.575
Mm.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.062
How you feeling?

33:06.110 --> 33:08.158
Good. I'm good.

33:08.200 --> 33:09.895
Come on.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.729
He's so big.

33:19.780 --> 33:21.384
Mm, wait till you hold him.

33:21.430 --> 33:23.739
Don't mind ifI do.Come on, baby.

33:26.830 --> 33:30.527
He just has
to get used to you.

33:30.570 --> 33:32.219
Right.

33:32.270 --> 33:34.044
All right.
Come on, it's
just Daddy!

33:34.090 --> 33:36.786
Daddy, you want to see
how we redid my room?

33:36.840 --> 33:38.740
Yeah, sweetie, I do.

33:38.790 --> 33:40.792
I really do.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.579
Come on, let's get going.

33:44.630 --> 33:46.439
Yeah. Come on.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.072
Ah. Forget how
clean it is here.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.423
You always say that.

34:09.480 --> 34:10.993
Ido?
Yes.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.644
Now, there's no dust,

34:12.700 --> 34:15.692
and dirt's in the ground
where it should be.

34:18.140 --> 34:20.961
Is this what you wanted
to talk to me about

34:21.010 --> 34:22.921
on the_plane?
Nah.

34:22.970 --> 34:26.883
But... I just think we
should stop somewhere, uh,

34:26.930 --> 34:29.148
before you drop me off.

34:29.190 --> 34:31.101
Stop somewhere?

34:31.150 --> 34:36.190
What, you don't think it's just
a little bit early for all that?

34:36.240 --> 34:39.459
Or maybe you just realized
you forgot toilet paper?

34:39.510 --> 34:40.761
Yeah.

34:42.550 --> 34:44.427
It's Danny.

34:44.470 --> 34:45.892
What?

34:45.950 --> 34:49.511
Look, look, I wanted to tell you
earlier, but I just...

34:49.560 --> 34:51.164
I just couldn't find
the right moment.Okay, Sonny,

34:51.210 --> 34:52.734
you're scaring me,
so just go ahead and tell me.

34:52.780 --> 34:54.338
Blackburn told me that he's
in a little bit of trouble.

34:54.390 --> 34:55.869
Talking about Blackburn
told you something?

34:55.910 --> 34:58.993
W-Why would Blackburn...Davis, look at me.

34:59.050 --> 35:01.006
It's drugs.

35:01.050 --> 35:03.177
Okay? And he's not doing good.

35:03.230 --> 35:05.448
What, he OD'd?

35:05.490 --> 35:06.878
He relapsed.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.182
Cops found him in his car.

35:09.230 --> 35:10.709
Where is he?

35:10.760 --> 35:12.751
He's at the VA hospital.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.236
MAN:
So, in the end,

36:03.290 --> 36:05.281
Brecht's "alienation effect"
was anything but,

36:05.330 --> 36:06.763
uniting his performers

36:06.810 --> 36:09.859
_ with the audience
in a new appreCIation

36:09.900 --> 36:14.166
for the complex political
and social issues of the day.

36:14.210 --> 36:15.643
Okay, that's it for the week.

36:15.690 --> 36:18.648
Try to get your Joyce papers
in to me ASAP.

36:18.690 --> 36:21.693
And if you need an agenda
for the MLA conference,

36:21.740 --> 36:22.957
speak to Ms. Baxter,

36:23.000 --> 36:24.649
who, as always, knows
more than any of us.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.429
Thank you, Gordon.

36:26.480 --> 36:27.469
Um...

36:27.530 --> 36:30.260
Yeah, okay.

36:30.310 --> 36:33.438
Okay, people, so the MLA added
four more sessions

36:33.490 --> 36:35.538
on transactional
text ana|y5is.

36:35.580 --> 36:37.798
Which means that
if you're like me,

36:37.840 --> 36:40.718
and you don't really know
what that is...

36:40.760 --> 36:43.012
...you can, uh, you can join me

36:43.070 --> 36:46.198
in my office, um...

36:47.770 --> 36:49.715
My office hours

36:49.770 --> 36:51.726
a-are...

36:51.770 --> 36:54.204
which are...

36:54.250 --> 36:56.946
my office...

37:01.870 --> 37:03.167
Um...

37:05.220 --> 37:08.087
Sorry, excuse me.

38:25.990 --> 38:28.254
Wait a minute, okay,
so you're telling me

39:23.400 --> 39:25.391
The salsa is really hot.

39:25.450 --> 39:27.611
Don't know

39:37.720 --> 39:40.587
Hey, have I ever told

39:42.680 --> 39:44.671
Tell me again.

39:44.730 --> 39:46.800
Well, we were in
high school together.

39:46.860 --> 39:49.374
Um, technically,
she was a junior.

39:49.430 --> 39:50.419
Scandalous.

39:50.470 --> 39:51.596
Yeah.

39:51.650 --> 39:53.948
And, uh, we used
to always go

39:54.000 --> 39:56.161
to this quarry
a-after school.

39:56.210 --> 39:58.861
When it was warm,
we'd go swimming.

39:58.910 --> 40:02.914
And, uh, I was... I was
always doing something crazy.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.394
You? Can't imagine.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.129
So, I did this, um....

40:09.180 --> 40:11.569
front flip, triple...

40:11.620 --> 40:14.441
thing, and I landed just...

40:14.490 --> 40:16.754
flat on my tummy.

40:16.800 --> 40:19.018
From about 35
feet up high.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.893
MANDY:

40:26.940 --> 40:29.249

40:29.290 --> 40:30.678
I was going down.

40:30.730 --> 40:32.209
And, um...

40:32.250 --> 40:34.855
then I felt this hand, it was...

40:34.910 --> 40:36.980
I looked over,
and this skinny girl,

40:37.040 --> 40:38.996
she was pulling me up, and...

40:39.040 --> 40:41.292
I never seen her before.

40:41.350 --> 40:43.306
Tough chick.Tough chick-- that's
what I thought.

40:43.350 --> 40:44.908
Looked over at her,

40:44.960 --> 40:46.689
and...

40:46.740 --> 40:49.049
she was grinning.

40:49.090 --> 40:51.092
And I knew, I...

40:55.800 --> 40:57.791
I knew that, uh...

41:06.630 --> 41:10.373
She was gonna be your wife.

41:11.510 --> 41:14.070
That she was
gonna be my wife.

41:15.560 --> 41:18.506
