So, I'm watching the season

and then "Queer Eye for the
Straight Guy" comes on, right?

00:44.545 --> 00:46.464
So I fall asleep in front
of the TV, and when I wake up,

00:46.589 --> 00:48.090
I see that I've spilled

My goodness, there certainly
are a lot of gay shows

02:06.418 --> 02:07.545
on television these days.

02:07.670 --> 02:08.295
Yeah.

02:08.420 --> 02:11.006
I think it's great that gays
are finally being so accepted.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.342
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.

02:14.552 --> 02:16.095
Kyle, what's happened to you?

Oh, hi, Gerald, Sheila.
- Hi, Sharon.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.609
Uh, we need to talk to you
about the boys.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.112
Sure. Come on in.
The guys are all watching TV.

02:33.237 --> 02:34.655
Oh, is the game on or something?

02:36.574 --> 02:38.993
Hey! Gerald!
How are you?

02:39.118 --> 02:40.703
- Hi, Gerald!
- Gerald!

02:40.828 --> 02:41.829
Sit down, Ger-Ger.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.622
"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"
is on.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.125
Oh, no.
You guys all turned gay, too?

02:48.335 --> 02:50.546
Not gay, Gerald.
Metrosexual.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.589
What's that?

02:51.714 --> 02:53.424
Just because a guy cares
about how he looks

02:53.549 --> 02:55.092
and is in touch
with his feminine side

02:55.217 --> 02:56.677
doesn't mean he's gay anymore!

02:56.802 --> 02:58.679
Metrosexual means
you're straight

02:58.804 --> 03:00.890
but you appreciate
the gay culture.

03:01.015 --> 03:03.767
It's super fabulous.
Would you like some shiraz?

03:03.893 --> 03:06.103
Shiraz is great.
- Don't our men look amazing?

03:06.228 --> 03:08.439
Haven't you seen "Queer Eye
for the Straight Guy," Sheila?

03:08.564 --> 03:09.773
These five gay men go around

03:09.899 --> 03:11.775
and show straight men
how to better themselves.

03:11.901 --> 03:12.860
It's the best!

03:12.985 --> 03:13.861
It is?

03:13.986 --> 03:14.904
Well, sure, Sheila.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.697
Our husbands are all so clean
and neat.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.241
My Randy irons his clothes
and even has pedicures!

03:19.366 --> 03:20.993
And they like to talk
about their feelings now

03:21.118 --> 03:22.912
and drink wine
and decorate the house!

03:23.037 --> 03:25.706
My Steven shaved his chest
<i>and</i> his balls!

03:25.831 --> 03:26.874
Ooh, I love it!

03:26.999 --> 03:28.250
And how about our boys, huh?

03:28.375 --> 03:31.045
Ever since gay culture became
cool, our boys bathe every night

03:31.170 --> 03:32.880
and brush their teeth
three times a day.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.340
This is the greatest thing ever.

03:34.465 --> 03:35.466
I don't know.

03:35.591 --> 03:38.469
Sometimes boys take
cultural fads too far.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.139
Dude, I can't wait for Wendy
to see how gay I look!

03:42.264 --> 03:43.140
That's true, you guys.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.892
When the chicks at school
see how gay we are,

03:45.017 --> 03:46.393
they're gonna be all over us.

03:46.518 --> 03:47.436
Mrph-mrph!

03:47.561 --> 03:49.438
All right.
Let's work it!

03:51.148 --> 03:52.107
What the...

03:52.233 --> 03:54.526
Toodle-oo, Conner.
See ya after classies.

03:54.652 --> 03:55.486
Okay, sweetums.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.154
Oh, my God.
Where is my homework?

03:57.279 --> 03:59.031
I am fuh-reaking out!

03:59.156 --> 04:01.825
Hey, dudes.

04:01.951 --> 04:02.743
Hey, Craig.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.245
You guys look pretty gay.

04:04.370 --> 04:05.287
Thanks!

04:05.412 --> 04:06.705
Not as gay as us, though.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.208
Oh, please, Craig.
We're 10 times gayer than you!

04:09.333 --> 04:11.335
Oh, yeah? We're super-duper
triple-dog gay!

04:11.460 --> 04:12.169
Oh, yeah?

04:12.294 --> 04:14.880
We're ultra-super-stamp-it-
stamp-it-no-erasies-mega gay!

04:15.005 --> 04:16.465
What's all this fighting about,
children?

04:16.590 --> 04:18.384
These guys are trying to say
they're gayer than us!

04:18.509 --> 04:20.094
Oh, no!

04:20.219 --> 04:21.387
Don't tell me you children

04:21.512 --> 04:24.056
have taken up this whole
metrosexual fad, too.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.224
Oh my God.

04:25.349 --> 04:27.059
This is not a fad.
This is who we are.

04:27.184 --> 04:27.977
No, it isn't.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.728
Last year, you children
were all trying to be black.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.855
Now you're all trying to be gay.

04:31.981 --> 04:33.065
We're metrosexual!

04:33.190 --> 04:35.484
Maybe, but you'll never be
as metrosexual as us.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.902
Come on, fags.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.153
God, I hate Craig!

04:38.279 --> 04:40.072
That son of a -- gah.

04:41.323 --> 04:44.451
Chef...I don't feel
very metrosexual.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.996
Well, then don't buy into
this fad, Kyle.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.873
Be who you are, not what's cool.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.336
All right, children.
Let's take our seats.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.588
Good morning, Mr. Garrison.

04:58.966 --> 05:02.094
Well, d-don't you all look nice.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.512
Ooh. Timmy.

05:06.557 --> 05:07.725
Dude, what are you doing?

05:07.850 --> 05:09.601
I didn't feel comfortable
in that stuff, dude.

05:09.727 --> 05:10.686
I'm just being me.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.980
Ha!
Told you you guys were straight.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.273
We're not straight.
You're straight!

05:14.398 --> 05:15.274
You're straight!
- You're straight!

05:15.399 --> 05:16.483
You're straight like a freeway.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.027
What the hell is going on?

05:18.152 --> 05:20.362
You wish you were gay, Craig!
In your dreams!

05:20.487 --> 05:22.614
I'm not just gay.
I'm a catamite.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.285
S-So?
I'm half bisexual.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.996
Oh, stop it! You kids don't even
know what you're talking about!

05:29.121 --> 05:30.748
Eric, you're not half bi!

05:30.873 --> 05:32.082
I'm like a quarter bi.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.626
My grandpa was bi,
so that makes me quarter bi.

05:34.752 --> 05:35.961
What?!

05:36.086 --> 05:39.381
It was the craziest thing
I've ever seen, Mr. Slave.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.550
All the children
were suddenly acting like

05:41.675 --> 05:42.801
being gay was cool.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.303
I mean, maybe we're not

05:44.428 --> 05:46.680
the only gay couple
in town anymore.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.974
Oh.
Jesus Christ.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.396
Look at that, Mr. Slave.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.691
Our cup runneth over.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.485
Jesus Christ.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.570
Mr. Garrison,
those are great pants.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.198
Thanks, Jimbo.
I really like your outfit, too.

06:04.323 --> 06:07.493
So -- So, Jimbo, you want to
come back to my place

06:07.618 --> 06:09.745
with me and Mr. Slave?

06:09.870 --> 06:11.497
Uh, for what?

06:11.622 --> 06:13.665
Well, you know.

06:13.791 --> 06:15.667
No.
- Huh.

06:15.793 --> 06:17.461
Mr. Garrison.
Hey, doll.

06:17.586 --> 06:18.545
Oh, hey, Randy.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.672
You're looking ultra fabulous.

06:20.798 --> 06:22.257
Thanks.
You too.

06:22.383 --> 06:24.468
So, uh, Randy...

06:24.593 --> 06:27.721
you want me to give you
a hand job in the bathroom?

06:27.846 --> 06:30.140
N-No, thanks.
I'm -- I'm not like that.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.393
Not -- Not like that?

06:32.518 --> 06:34.061
How about some shiraz, guys?

06:34.186 --> 06:35.646
Oh, thanks, Mr. Tweek.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.439
My pleasure, silly buns.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.357
Oh.

06:38.482 --> 06:41.860
Well, Mr. Tweek, why don't we,
uh, go back to my place?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.195
Why?

06:43.320 --> 06:44.655
Well, you know,
I was just thinking

06:44.780 --> 06:47.366
we could put on some music
and watch videos

06:47.491 --> 06:49.535
and pound Mr. Slave's
tight little ass.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.578
Ooh.
Jesus Christ.

06:51.703 --> 06:54.206
Oh! Goodness, no.
I-I'm straight.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.166
Straight?
Oh...

06:56.291 --> 06:58.085
Oh, what -- Just what the hell
is going on here?!

06:58.210 --> 06:59.128
Huh?

06:59.253 --> 07:01.588
Why won't anybody pound
Mr. Slave's butt?

07:01.713 --> 07:04.550
Well, we don't pound butt,
Mr. Garrison. We're straight.

07:04.675 --> 07:07.594
Those pants and those shoes
say you pound butt!

07:07.719 --> 07:11.181
Hey, now, that's not true.
My shoes don't say I pound butt.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.600
No, <i>your</i> shoes say you
take it in the butt.

07:13.725 --> 07:14.977
It's okay, Mr. Garrison.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.396
We've learned that gays
are totally cool.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.064
You're just one of us now.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.190
Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.525
One of you?!

07:21.650 --> 07:24.319
We spend our whole lives
trying <i>not</i> to be one of you!

07:24.445 --> 07:26.238
You can't do this to us!

07:27.531 --> 07:28.657
Have you guys seen this?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.325
It's a conditioner
that you can leave in,

07:30.451 --> 07:32.035
and it detoxifies the scalp.

07:32.161 --> 07:33.120
Wow.
Is that from Origins?

07:33.245 --> 07:34.746
Yeah. It's a charcoal-based
thing that --

07:34.872 --> 07:38.000
Hey, guys, you want to go
throw the football around?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.419
Guys, can I talk to you
over here for a second?

07:41.670 --> 07:44.173
Look, guys, a lot of the kids
in school are talking, okay?

07:44.298 --> 07:46.633
And they're spreading rumors
that we're not metrosexuals

07:46.758 --> 07:48.260
because we hang out with Kyle.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.636
Well, what can we do about it?

07:49.761 --> 07:51.096
We have no choice, you guys.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.223
We're just gonna have to kill
Kyle.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.642
What?! That's stupid.
We wouldn't have to kill Kyle.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.936
We would just have to tell him
not to hang around us anymore.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.146
Oh.
You know, you're right, Stan.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.607
We just have to tell Kyle
not to hang around us anymore.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.233
Yeah. Wait. What?
- You hear that, Kenny?

08:03.358 --> 08:05.527
Stan thinks we should tell Kyle
not to hang around us anymore.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.528
I think he's right.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.947
Good luck telling him, Stan.
I know it won't be easy.

08:09.072 --> 08:12.284
Hey, butch boy.
Nice football you got there.

08:13.577 --> 08:16.580
When was the last time you had
a manicure, straight man?

08:16.705 --> 08:18.123
Yeah.
Let's see that hair.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.167
Look!
He's not even using any product!

08:21.919 --> 08:22.836
Hey, what's going on?

08:22.961 --> 08:26.840
Oh, here come the butch boys to
help their butchy little friend.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.010
He's not <i>our</i> friend.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.598
Stan?

08:37.392 --> 08:40.103
This playground is
for metrosexuals, macho man.

08:40.229 --> 08:42.231
Take your nonflaming ass
to some other school.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.691
Come on. Let's get him.
- Kick his ass!

08:53.492 --> 08:55.744
Kyle!
What happened to you?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.997
I got beat up at school...
for being different.

08:59.122 --> 08:59.831
What?!

08:59.957 --> 09:01.959
Your classmates beat you up
for being a Jew?

09:02.084 --> 09:04.628
No!
For not being a metrosexual.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.964
Gerald!
Gerald, get down here.

09:07.089 --> 09:11.093
He-e-e-re I come!

09:16.932 --> 09:19.309
Oh, no!
Dad's metrosexual, too?!

09:19.434 --> 09:21.353
Kyle!
You look terrible!

09:21.478 --> 09:23.438
The boys at school
beat him up, Gerald.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.774
Oh, really?
Well, don't you worry, Kyle.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.068
We can cover that black eye up
with some cream base,

09:28.193 --> 09:30.404
and the coat and pants
we'll bleach with an acid wash

09:30.529 --> 09:31.780
for a fun, vintage look.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.449
Aah!
Just leave me alone!

09:35.325 --> 09:37.911
<i>There you go.
Now you look fabulous.</i>

09:38.036 --> 09:38.745
You see that?

09:38.870 --> 09:40.998
A spray-on tan does wonders
for your look.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.002
Let's get down to the tango
class and learn some new steps.

09:45.127 --> 09:48.171
That does it!
I know what I have to do.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.092
Oh.
Hello, Mr. Garrison.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.011
Chef, can I talk to you?

09:54.136 --> 09:55.470
Sure.
Come on in.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.514
Thanks.
Come, slave.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.894
It's just awful, Chef.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.730
I used to feel like
an outsider,

10:04.855 --> 10:07.524
a totally different person
who stood out in this town.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.485
Now every straight guy
is acting gayer than me!

10:10.611 --> 10:13.030
Oh, Jesus.
Jesus Christ!

10:13.155 --> 10:14.656
Well, what do you want me to do
about it?

10:14.781 --> 10:18.201
Chef, what did you do when
white people stole your culture?

10:18.327 --> 10:19.202
Oh.

10:19.328 --> 10:21.204
Well, we black people
just always tried to stay

10:21.330 --> 10:23.707
out in front of them.
- How did you do that?

10:23.832 --> 10:25.083
Well, like with our slang.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.502
Black people always used to say
"I'm in the house"

10:27.628 --> 10:28.754
instead of "I'm here."

10:28.879 --> 10:30.922
But then white people all
started to say "in the house,"

10:31.048 --> 10:32.424
so we switched it
to "in the hizzouse."

10:32.549 --> 10:33.884
"Hizzouse" became "hizzizzouse."

10:34.009 --> 10:35.719
And then white folk
started saying <i>that,</i>

10:35.844 --> 10:38.221
and we had to change it to
"heezie," then "in the hizzle,"

10:38.347 --> 10:40.265
which we had to change
to "hizzle for zizzle."

10:40.390 --> 10:42.559
And now because white people
say "hizzle for zizzle,"

10:42.684 --> 10:45.395
we have to say
"flippity floppity floop."

10:46.104 --> 10:48.357
We don't have time
for all that, Chef.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.026
Oh, if only those "Queer Eye
for the Straight Guy" people

10:51.151 --> 10:53.153
understood what they were doing.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.613
Wait.
That's it!

10:54.738 --> 10:56.907
I know exactly what to do!

10:57.032 --> 10:57.908
Come on, Mr. Slave!

10:58.033 --> 11:00.077
Let's get back to our
flippity floppity floop.

11:00.202 --> 11:03.330
Oh, no!
Damn it, don't call it that.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.291
One ticket to New York, please.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.335
You're going to New York alone?

11:08.460 --> 11:10.754
I'm going to see the "Queer Eye
for the Straight Guy" people.

11:10.879 --> 11:13.799
Ooh! Great idea. They can help
you with those dated clothes.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.092
Ugh.

11:28.730 --> 11:29.898
Mr. Garrison?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.274
Kyle.
What are you doing here?

11:31.400 --> 11:32.275
I'm going to New York

11:32.401 --> 11:34.069
to kill the "Queer Eye
for the Straight Guy" people.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.654
What?!
That's what I'm doing!

11:35.779 --> 11:38.532
Oh, no. They ruined my life.
I get to kill them first.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.283
They took gay culture
from real gays,

11:40.409 --> 11:41.868
and their asses are ours!

11:41.993 --> 11:43.620
I thought of it first!
- No, you didn't! No, you didn't!

11:43.745 --> 11:44.621
Did so! Did so!

11:44.746 --> 11:46.748
I thought of it yesterday!
- I thought of it two days ago!

11:46.873 --> 11:48.250
I thought of it
before you were born!

11:48.375 --> 11:50.210
Stop it, you two!
Stop it!

11:50.335 --> 11:52.504
Don't you see how crazy this is?

11:52.629 --> 11:55.006
Oh, you're right, Mr. Slave.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.008
We can both kill them together.

11:57.134 --> 11:57.968
Cool.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.138
Wow.
We look great!

12:01.263 --> 12:03.515
Yeah.
Let's see Craig outgay us now.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.891
Boys, boys, come on!

12:05.016 --> 12:06.685
There's a sale
down at Express for Men!

12:08.770 --> 12:11.648
Hey, guys, there's a sale
at Express for Men!

12:11.773 --> 12:12.733
Oh, my God!
- Sale at Express?!

12:12.858 --> 12:13.859
Let's go!
- Let's go!

12:13.984 --> 12:16.528
You guys have got to see
these shoes I bought!

12:16.653 --> 12:19.030
Hurry, you guys!
The mall closes in seven hours!

12:19.156 --> 12:22.200
Oh, why can't we all live
at the mall?

12:22.325 --> 12:24.161
You know, I'm starting to think

12:24.286 --> 12:27.205
this whole metrosexual thing
isn't so great.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.248
I know what you mean.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.251
All my husband ever does now is
look at himself in the mirror.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.879
He cares more about how he looks
than how I look.

12:34.004 --> 12:37.382
I hope something happens soon
to put an end to this whole fad.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.136
Guys, you've done
a terrific job.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.847
"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"
is our number-one show.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.392
What can I say?
We're fabulous.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.978
You guys are changing the world.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.647
And tomorrow,
we're gonna have you make over

12:52.773 --> 12:54.775
the president
of the United States!

12:54.900 --> 12:56.109
Oh, my God.
I think I'm gonna faint.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.030
Room service.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.948
What? We didn't order
any room service.

13:02.073 --> 13:05.869
Oh. Well, the woman
at the front desk sent it up.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.412
Carol?
I'll have to check on this.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.706
Excuse me a minute, fellas.

13:13.543 --> 13:14.628
Clear!

13:14.753 --> 13:16.213
Okay, Mr. Slave!

13:20.050 --> 13:23.595
Jesus...Christ.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.931
Well, crap.
That didn't work.

13:27.682 --> 13:30.185
You better shut up, Craig.
- Everyone knows it's true.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.520
It is not!
- Is so.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.063
Craig, behave yourself.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.190
Yeah, Stanley.
What are you fighting about?

13:35.315 --> 13:37.859
Dad, Craig's trying to say
that his dad can outdress you.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.654
What? Son, that's a silly thing
to fight about.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.573
Yeah. Everyone already knows
I dress better than Randy.

13:43.698 --> 13:44.825
Oh, really?

13:44.950 --> 13:47.494
I mean, you do have the fashion
sense of a Japanese woman.

13:47.619 --> 13:48.870
Ooh!
- Ooh!

13:48.995 --> 13:50.038
Please, girlfriend.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.624
You look like some kind of
Little Orphan Annie nightmare.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.001
Oh, no!
- Burn!

13:55.126 --> 13:57.546
Oh, stop it.
Will you all just stop it?!

13:58.463 --> 14:00.632
Look, you guys are
carrying this fad too far.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.717
Will you please stop acting
this way?

14:03.635 --> 14:06.888
You don't...like us
being metrosexual?

14:07.013 --> 14:08.306
No!

14:08.431 --> 14:10.976
Well, you know what I think?

14:11.101 --> 14:12.978
I think you're all metrophobic!

14:13.103 --> 14:14.563
Yeah!
- What?

14:14.688 --> 14:16.481
We shouldn't be fighting
amongst ourselves.

14:16.606 --> 14:19.192
We should be uniting
against metrophobes like these.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.527
This is crazy.

14:20.652 --> 14:24.698
Crazy, different, outcasts --
call us what you want.

14:24.823 --> 14:27.784
But us metros are real people,
just like you.

14:27.909 --> 14:30.954
You can metro-bash us all you
want, but we're here to stay.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.123
Yeah, Mom.
We're proud of who we are.

14:33.248 --> 14:35.333
That's right -- proud.
You know what I think, guys?

14:35.458 --> 14:37.919
I think we should have
a metrosexual-pride parade.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.839
Great idea, Eric --
raise metrosexual awareness!

14:40.964 --> 14:43.758
We can make floats and decorate
them with streamers and flowers.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.552
Mrph-mrph!
- Come on, fellas!

14:45.677 --> 14:47.596
Out of the malls
and into the streets!

14:47.721 --> 14:49.180
Out of the malls
and into the streets!

14:49.306 --> 14:50.557
Out of the malls
and into the streets!

14:50.682 --> 14:52.976
What the hell did that show do
to them?

14:55.020 --> 14:57.355
You sure you don't
want to press charges?

14:57.480 --> 14:58.440
That's okay, Officer.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.317
I think they learned
murder is wrong.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.319
Especially in <i>those</i> pants.

15:02.444 --> 15:05.322
Look, guys, we're sorry
we tried to murder you,

15:05.447 --> 15:07.699
but you have to stop
what you're doing.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.285
Are you crazy?
We're the hottest thing on TV.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.203
But don't you see the price?

15:12.329 --> 15:14.664
You're selling out
your own kind.

15:14.789 --> 15:17.000
Look, us gays have created
a lifestyle,

15:17.125 --> 15:19.044
a-a culture
that is uniquely ours.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.838
If we keep trying to make
straight people into us,

15:21.963 --> 15:25.383
we're gonna have no identity
left.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.471
Sorry, Charlie.
No sale.

15:29.971 --> 15:33.516
But --
But this doesn't make sense!

15:33.642 --> 15:36.478
How can gay men do this
to their own people?!

15:36.603 --> 15:41.566
Unless...you're not gay at all.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.529
You just
had to push it, didn't you?

15:46.655 --> 15:49.115
Just had to
keep asking questions.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.744
Now you know the truth.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.413
They aren't gay?
Then what are they?

15:55.538 --> 15:57.082
For a thousand years,

15:57.207 --> 15:59.292
our kind have lived
beneath the earth's crust,

15:59.417 --> 16:01.711
banished by man
in the kindling wars.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.505
Oh my God.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.888
We are the crab people!

16:13.264 --> 16:14.599
Jesus Christ!

16:14.724 --> 16:19.145
Crab people...crab people.

16:19.270 --> 16:23.191
Crab people...crab people.

16:30.156 --> 16:34.119
Crab people...crab people...

16:34.244 --> 16:36.246
crab people.

16:36.371 --> 16:38.331
See now where we have been
forced to live

16:38.456 --> 16:40.208
for a thousand years.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.711
But soon we shall rule
the land above,

16:42.836 --> 16:44.754
and mankind will be gone!

16:44.879 --> 16:46.506
Gone?!

16:46.631 --> 16:50.385
Crab people...crab people.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.389
Crab people are too small and
weak to take over man by force,

16:54.514 --> 16:58.268
and so we came up
with our perfect plan.

16:58.393 --> 17:00.520
Crab people...

17:02.147 --> 17:05.650
If you
can't beat man, change man.

17:05.775 --> 17:06.735
I knew it.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.404
I knew gay people would never
do this to their own kind.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.364
When all the world
is metrosexual,

17:11.489 --> 17:14.868
the crab people
shall finally reign supreme!

17:14.993 --> 17:19.164
Crab people...crab people.

17:19.289 --> 17:22.625
Tastes like crab,
talk like people.

17:22.751 --> 17:25.003
Crab people.

17:25.128 --> 17:27.630
You'll never turn me
into a metrosexual!

17:27.756 --> 17:29.966
I like being a dirty,
filthy little boy!

17:30.091 --> 17:30.925
Very well.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.928
If we can't make you
into metrosexuals,

17:34.054 --> 17:37.265
then we will make you
into crab people.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.600
Take them!

18:01.289 --> 18:03.583
Tom, I'm standing in South Park,
Colorado,

18:03.708 --> 18:06.711
where the first annual
Metrosexual Pride Parade

18:06.836 --> 18:08.046
is under way.

18:08.171 --> 18:09.255
Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

18:09.380 --> 18:11.382
Yeah!
- Metro pride!

18:11.508 --> 18:13.134
We're here! We're not queer!

18:13.259 --> 18:15.053
But we're close!
Get used to it!

18:15.178 --> 18:16.387
We're here!
We're not queer!

18:16.513 --> 18:17.639
But we're close!
Get used to it!

18:17.764 --> 18:20.475
That does it.
I can't take it anymore!

18:20.600 --> 18:23.269
I should have never wished
for a cleaner, neater husband.

18:23.394 --> 18:26.981
Ladies, get your things.
I know what we have to do.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.319
Whoa!
Look out!

18:34.114 --> 18:36.241
Oh, my God!
It's on fire!

18:36.366 --> 18:37.951
Put it out!
Put it out!

18:38.076 --> 18:40.203
I can't do anything.
These are brand-new pants.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.122
The heat could really damage
our hair.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.957
We'd better let the police
handle this.

18:44.082 --> 18:46.918
Are you crazy?
I just had my uniform pressed.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.212
Oh, Jesus! It's burning!
- Oh, my God!

18:49.337 --> 18:51.256
Put it out! Put it out!
- Jesus!

18:51.381 --> 18:52.632
Fire!

18:54.676 --> 18:57.470
Mr. President, it is such
an honor to make you over.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.597
Now, we've got to do something
with your hair.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.808
And your nails are filthy.
Let's get those clean.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.977
This is gay gold!

19:04.102 --> 19:06.813
Stop them!
They're crab people!

19:06.938 --> 19:09.357
They cannot see or hear us,
foolish man.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.608
Now stand by and watch

19:10.733 --> 19:13.194
as your pitiful race
becomes helpless!

19:13.319 --> 19:15.280
That is very good,
Mr. President.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.740
Now put on this silk jacket.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.617
No, Mr. President!
Don't do it!

19:19.742 --> 19:21.661
Help!
- You bastards.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.831
That looks great.
Now, how about some moisturizer?

19:26.374 --> 19:27.959
There they are!
Get 'em!

19:28.084 --> 19:29.085
What?

19:29.210 --> 19:31.963
You turned our husbands
into whiny little wusses!

19:32.088 --> 19:33.923
It's payback time!

19:38.094 --> 19:39.470
Oh, my God!
What are they doing?

19:39.596 --> 19:41.931
No! No!

19:45.685 --> 19:47.729
Wha-- What have you done?

19:47.854 --> 19:50.982
We're sorry,
but we didn't have a choice.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.734
You see, at first we liked

19:52.859 --> 19:54.694
having our men be clean
and neat.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.529
We thought that having them
use product in their hair

19:56.654 --> 19:58.990
and wanting facials
would make them sexier,

19:59.115 --> 19:59.991
but it doesn't.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.034
That's right.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.203
Even though my Stephen
sicks me out sometimes,

20:03.328 --> 20:06.247
it's his rugged, manly grossness
that I'm attracted to.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.625
We're sorry, but we knew
that the only answer

20:08.750 --> 20:10.877
was to kill
the "Queer Eye" guys.

20:11.002 --> 20:12.795
Well, you're going to jail for
th--

20:12.921 --> 20:15.715
Wait a minute. What is that?

20:15.840 --> 20:18.176
No!
Our evil plans!

20:18.301 --> 20:20.178
No.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.056
Oh my God.

20:23.181 --> 20:24.891
They were crab people.

20:25.016 --> 20:25.850
Yes!

20:25.975 --> 20:27.894
They were trying to
systematically make men

20:28.019 --> 20:30.396
into wusses so they could
take over the world.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.232
Mom!
- Kyle!

20:32.357 --> 20:34.108
I should have known
they were crab people.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.110
They tried this before
with "The Jeffersons".

20:36.236 --> 20:39.280
So now can you please change
your network's programming?

20:39.405 --> 20:40.406
Yes.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.408
Yes.
I think this gay fad is over.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.285
Gentlemen, back to studio 12.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.621
We're gonna bring back
the Latin fad.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.460
Hey, <i>eses.</i>

20:52.585 --> 20:55.713
Hey, <i>jefe.</i>
You want some <i>cerveza?</i>

20:58.049 --> 20:59.092
Kyle.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.761
Hey, <i>ese,</i> you want to come
play catch with us?

21:01.886 --> 21:04.555
What? You want me to hang out
with you?

21:04.681 --> 21:06.599
Yeah, it's cool, homes.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.434
No, dude, it really isn't cool.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.186
You all turned your backs on me.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.021
You're supposed to be my
best friends, and you just --

21:12.146 --> 21:13.648
you treated me like nothing.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.400
And now you all expect me
to just forget it all

21:15.525 --> 21:18.027
and hang out with you again
like nothing happened?

21:18.152 --> 21:19.988
Oh, Jesus, Kyle. Don't be
such a whiny little gaywad.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.030
Come play catch with us.

21:21.155 --> 21:23.408
Yeah.
Don't be such a fag, dude.

21:33.543 --> 21:35.003
God damn it.
