00:34.433 --> 00:35.567
>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:35.567 --> 00:37.934
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:37.934 --> 00:38.500
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.033
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:39.033 --> 00:43.100
FOR JOINING US.

00:43.100 --> 00:44.200
WE ARE BACK, WHICH IS EXCITING,

00:44.200 --> 00:46.633
ALTHOUGH SADLY, WE MUST BEGIN BY

00:46.633 --> 00:47.166
ADDRESSING WEDNESDAY'S

00:47.166 --> 00:48.333
HEARTBREAKING EVENTS IN

00:48.333 --> 00:49.700
PARKLAND, FLORIDA, WHERE YET

00:49.700 --> 00:51.166
ANOTHER SCHOOL SHOOTING LEFT

00:51.166 --> 00:53.266
17 DEAD AND MANY INJURED.

00:53.266 --> 00:54.967
THESE EVENTS ARE NOW SO FAMILIAR

00:54.967 --> 00:57.166
WE BASICALLY KNOW HOW EACH SIDE

00:57.166 --> 00:58.467
WILL PLAY OUT.

00:58.467 --> 00:59.667
"THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS"?

00:59.667 --> 01:00.166
"FUCK YOUR THOUGHTS

01:00.166 --> 01:01.433
AND PRAYERS."

01:01.433 --> 01:03.200
"IT'S A MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM"?

01:03.200 --> 01:03.734
"YES, BUT IT'S ALSO A GUN

01:03.734 --> 01:04.600
PROBLEM."

01:04.600 --> 01:05.734
THEN SOMEONE SAYS, "NOW'S NOT

01:05.734 --> 01:06.500
THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT GUN

01:06.500 --> 01:07.667
CONTROL," AND EVERYONE MOVES ON

01:07.667 --> 01:13.333
UNTIL IT HAPPENS AGAIN.

01:13.333 --> 01:14.500
BUT THIS TIME FELT DIFFERENT,

01:14.500 --> 01:15.133
BECAUSE WHEN THE "NOW'S NOT THE

01:15.133 --> 01:16.500
TIME" ARGUMENT CAME OUT,

01:16.500 --> 01:17.867
THE KIDS FROM THE SCHOOL SAID,

01:17.867 --> 01:19.000
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.967
YES, IT FUCKING IS."

01:20.967 --> 01:22.867
>> THEY HAVE US THINKING THIS IS

01:22.867 --> 01:24.066
INEVITABLE AND THAT WE CAN'T DO

01:24.066 --> 01:24.867
ANYTHING TO STOP IT.

01:24.867 --> 01:26.867
IT'S TOO DIFFICULT.

01:26.867 --> 01:28.200
WE'RE DONE WITH THAT.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.367
>> SOMEONE WHO ISN'T ALLOWED TO

01:29.367 --> 01:32.000
BUY ALCOHOL LEGALLY IS ALLOWED

01:32.000 --> 01:33.567
TO BUY A WAR WEAPON LIKE WHERE

01:33.567 --> 01:35.834
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

01:35.834 --> 01:37.400
>> THEY SAY NO LAWS COULD HAVE

01:37.400 --> 01:38.266
BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT THE

01:38.266 --> 01:38.900
HUNDREDS OF SENSELESS TRAGEDIES

01:38.900 --> 01:42.133
THAT HAVE OCCURRED.

01:42.133 --> 01:43.367
WE CALL B.S.!

01:43.367 --> 01:44.667
THAT US KIDS DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:44.667 --> 01:45.867
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, THAT WE'RE

01:45.867 --> 01:47.066
TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE

01:47.066 --> 01:49.133
GOVERNMENT WORKS.

01:49.133 --> 01:52.367
WE CALL B.S.!

01:52.367 --> 01:54.300
IF YOU AGREE, REGISTER TO VOTE.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.200
CONTACT YOUR LOCAL

01:55.200 --> 01:56.800
CONGRESSPEOPLE.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.467
GIVE THEM A PIECE OF YOUR MIND.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.233
>> John: "WE CALL B.S."

02:01.233 --> 02:03.800
IT'S A LITTLE IRONIC THE PEOPLE

02:03.800 --> 02:04.367
WHO ARE ACTING WITH THE MOST

02:04.367 --> 02:05.934
MATURITY IN THIS HORRIFYING

02:05.934 --> 02:07.400
SITUATION AREN'T EVEN OLD ENOUGH

02:07.400 --> 02:08.433
TO SAY THE WORD "BULLSHIT"

02:08.433 --> 02:10.967
IN FRONT OF THEIR PARENTS.

02:10.967 --> 02:11.834
THOSE KIDS HAVE ALREADY

02:11.834 --> 02:13.266
ANNOUNCED A MARCH NEXT MONTH,

02:13.266 --> 02:15.066
AND IN DOING SO, ARE CHALLENGING

02:15.066 --> 02:16.133
ADULTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A REAL

02:16.133 --> 02:18.633
CONVERSATION ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE.

02:18.633 --> 02:20.400
BUT THEY WILL BE UP AGAINST IT.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.734
BECAUSE WHEN ONE ADULT WAS ASKED

02:21.734 --> 02:22.867
THIS MORNING ABOUT WHETHER

02:22.867 --> 02:24.633
REPUBLICANS WOULD NOTICE OF

02:24.633 --> 02:26.033
THESE KIDS' CONCERNS ABOUT GUNS,

02:26.033 --> 02:27.934
THIS WAS HIS RESPONSE.

02:27.934 --> 02:29.100
>> WE HAVE A CULTURE THING THAT

02:29.100 --> 02:29.967
WE'RE NOT DISCUSSING.

02:29.967 --> 02:31.333
WHEN I GREW UP, IT WAS

02:31.333 --> 02:32.767
ANDY GRIFFITH AND YOU NEVER HAD

02:32.767 --> 02:33.633
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS AND WE STILL

02:33.633 --> 02:36.533
HAD PRAYER IN SCHOOL.

02:36.533 --> 02:37.266
WE DROVE TO SCHOOL WITH GUNS

02:37.266 --> 02:38.567
IN THE CAR.

02:38.567 --> 02:39.633
I SAY "WE."

02:39.633 --> 02:41.200
I WOULD SEE STUDENTS THAT

02:41.200 --> 02:42.066
WOULD DO THAT.

02:42.066 --> 02:43.567
TODAY WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT TIME

02:43.567 --> 02:45.700
WHEN -- NOT THE MEDIA BUT THE

02:45.700 --> 02:46.734
MOVIE INDUSTRY, THE RAP

02:46.734 --> 02:48.433
INDUSTRY, RADIO IN GENERAL --

02:48.433 --> 02:50.200
TALKS ABOUT THESE THINGS THAT

02:50.200 --> 02:52.266
ARE COMMON NOW AND WE HAVE

02:52.266 --> 02:53.433
ALMOST DESENSITIZED IT.

02:53.433 --> 02:54.967
NOW WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT KIDS

02:54.967 --> 02:55.934
EATING TIDE PODS INSTEAD OF

02:55.934 --> 02:59.967
DISCIPLINE.

02:59.967 --> 03:01.567
>> John: WHAT?

03:01.567 --> 03:03.533
I CALL B.S. ON THAT.

03:03.533 --> 03:04.600
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WRONG

03:04.600 --> 03:06.300
THERE, FROM THE "RAP INDUSTRY"

03:06.300 --> 03:08.467
TO THE TIDE PODS TO THE FACT

03:08.467 --> 03:10.967
THAT THAT MAN WAS BORN IN 1969,

03:10.967 --> 03:12.734
A YEAR AFTER THE ANDY GRIFFITH

03:12.734 --> 03:15.000
SHOW WENT OFF THE AIR,

03:15.000 --> 03:16.433
WHICH I GUESS MEANS HE MAY NEVER

03:16.433 --> 03:18.633
HAVE SEEN IT, BECAUSE NOT ONLY

03:18.633 --> 03:19.867
DID SHERIFF ANDY TAYLOR NOT

03:19.867 --> 03:20.533
CARRY A GUN, HE WAS HAPPY TO

03:20.533 --> 03:22.900
EXPLAIN WHY.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.100
>> WHEN A MAN CARRIES A GUN ALL

03:24.100 --> 03:25.967
THE TIME, THE RESPECT HE THINKS

03:25.967 --> 03:27.800
HE'S GETTING MIGHT REALLY BE

03:27.800 --> 03:30.033
FEAR, SO I DON'T CARRY A GUN

03:30.033 --> 03:31.367
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THE PEOPLE

03:31.367 --> 03:33.567
OF MAYBERRY TO FEAR A GUN.

03:33.567 --> 03:39.367
I'D RATHER THEY RESPECT ME.

03:39.367 --> 03:40.133
>> John: YEAH.

03:40.133 --> 03:40.734
HE'S GOT A POINT.

03:40.734 --> 03:41.667
AND THE PEOPLE OF MAYBERRY DID

03:41.667 --> 03:42.367
RESPECT HIM, DESPITE THE FACT

03:42.367 --> 03:44.000
THAT, AND THIS IS TRUE, HE ATE

03:44.000 --> 03:47.500
TIDE PODS ALL THE TIME.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.633
MEANWHILE, THE TRUMP

03:48.633 --> 03:50.266
ADMINISTRATION HAD ANOTHER

03:50.266 --> 03:51.000
CHAOTIC WEEK, FROM

03:51.000 --> 03:51.934
MUELLER'S RUSSIA INDICTMENTS TO

03:51.934 --> 03:53.533
CONTINUING QUESTIONS SURROUNDING

03:53.533 --> 03:55.000
ROB PORTER AND WHO KNEW WHAT

03:55.000 --> 03:56.300
WHEN ABOUT HIS ALLEGED DOMESTIC

03:56.300 --> 03:57.200
VIOLENCE, TO TRUMP'S NEWLY

03:57.200 --> 03:58.233
REPORTED AFFAIR WITH

03:58.233 --> 04:03.166
A FORMER PLAYBOY MODEL,

04:03.166 --> 04:06.233
A DIFFERENT AFFAIR FROM THAT

04:06.233 --> 04:07.100
OTHER AFFAIR.

04:07.100 --> 04:08.100
BUT IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION, THE

04:08.100 --> 04:09.200
REST OF THE WORLD HAS ALSO HAD

04:09.200 --> 04:09.767
A POLITICALLY CHAOTIC WEEK.

04:09.767 --> 04:10.567
AND FOR A PALATE CLEANSER,

04:10.567 --> 04:12.700
LET ME GIVE YOU A QUICK TOUR.

04:12.700 --> 04:15.133
AND LET'S START IN SOUTH AFRICA.

04:15.133 --> 04:17.233
PAUL SIMON'S BLACK FRIEND.

04:17.233 --> 04:18.834
THEIR PRESIDENT, THE LEGENDARILY

04:18.834 --> 04:20.333
CORRUPT JACOB ZUMA, STEPPED DOWN

04:20.333 --> 04:21.400
ON WEDNESDAY FOLLOWING YEARS OF

04:21.400 --> 04:23.100
SCANDAL.

04:23.100 --> 04:24.967
SO WILL THEY MISS HIM?

04:24.967 --> 04:26.800
WELL, JUST LISTEN TO WHAT

04:26.800 --> 04:27.967
HAPPENED WHEN HIS NAME WAS

04:27.967 --> 04:29.767
MENTIONED BY HIS SUCCESSOR AND

04:29.767 --> 04:32.433
WATCH THE SIGN LANGUAGE

04:32.433 --> 04:33.200
INTERPRETER IN THE CORNER REALLY

04:33.200 --> 04:35.000
READ THE ROOM.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.233
>> I ALSO WISH TO EXTEND A WORD

04:36.233 --> 04:37.567
OF GRATITUDE TO FORMER PRESIDENT

04:37.567 --> 04:43.767
JACOB ZUMA.

04:50.433 --> 04:51.934
>> John: I WANT THAT WOMAN IN

04:51.934 --> 04:54.000
THE CORNER OF EVERYTHING.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.400
STATE OF THE UNION?

04:55.400 --> 04:56.934
I WANT HER THERE.

04:56.934 --> 04:57.967
A FIGURE SKATER FALLING?

04:57.967 --> 05:00.166
I WANT HER THERE.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.500
JACK DIES ON "THIS IS US"?

05:01.500 --> 05:03.233
I WANT HER THERE.

05:03.233 --> 05:04.133
YOU WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE

05:04.133 --> 05:06.834
FOR THE DOG, JACK?

05:06.834 --> 05:08.633
FUCK THE DOG!

05:08.633 --> 05:10.867
YOU'VE GOT KIDS!

05:10.867 --> 05:11.767
BOO, JACK!

05:11.767 --> 05:12.400
AND IT WASN'T JUST SOUTH AFRICA

05:12.400 --> 05:13.100
EXPERIENCING TURMOIL.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.633
LOOK AT AUSTRALIA.

05:14.633 --> 05:15.734
70% UNINHABITABLE BECAUSE OF

05:15.734 --> 05:17.100
DESERT, AND 30% UNINHABITABLE

05:17.100 --> 05:19.667
BECAUSE OF AUSTRALIANS.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.066
WE'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT THEIR

05:21.066 --> 05:21.867
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER,

05:21.867 --> 05:22.967
BARNABY JOYCE, BEFORE, YOU MAY

05:22.967 --> 05:23.734
REMEMBER, HE THREATENED TO

05:23.734 --> 05:24.567
EUTHANIZE JOHNNY DEPP'S

05:24.567 --> 05:26.667
ILLEGALLY IMPORTED DOGS,

05:26.667 --> 05:29.200
PISTOL AND BOO.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.300
WELL, JOYCE IS A SOCIAL

05:30.300 --> 05:31.500
CONSERVATIVE WHO OPPOSED

05:31.500 --> 05:32.967
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IN THEIR

05:32.967 --> 05:34.400
REFERENDUM LAST YEAR, BECAUSE HE

05:34.400 --> 05:35.133
BELIEVES IN TRADITIONAL FAMILY

05:35.133 --> 05:36.667
VALUES, AND YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE

05:36.667 --> 05:39.400
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.500
>> BARNABY JOYCE, FACING THE

05:40.500 --> 05:43.233
PUBLIC OVER A PRIVATE MATTER.

05:43.233 --> 05:44.367
THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER

05:44.367 --> 05:45.934
PLEADING FOR PRIVACY AFTER NEWS

05:45.934 --> 05:47.834
CORP PUBLISHED PHOTOGRAPHS OF

05:47.834 --> 05:49.333
HIS FORMER MEDIA ADVISER NOW

05:49.333 --> 05:53.834
HEAVILY PREGNANT WITH HIS CHILD.

05:53.834 --> 05:54.967
>> John: YOU MIGHT THINK THAT'S

05:54.967 --> 05:56.467
HYPOCRITICAL, BUT IN REALITY,

05:56.467 --> 05:58.100
JOYCE HAS SUCH INCREDIBLE FAMILY

05:58.100 --> 06:00.400
VALUES THAT HE CAN'T RESTRICT

06:00.400 --> 06:03.300
THEM TO JUST ONE FAMILY.

06:03.300 --> 06:05.467
THE AUSTRALIAN MEDIA HAS JUMPED

06:05.467 --> 06:06.767
ON THIS STORY LIKE A DEPUTY

06:06.767 --> 06:08.000
PRIME MINISTER WITH A WIFE AND

06:08.000 --> 06:09.100
FOUR CHILDREN JUMPING ON HIS 33

06:09.100 --> 06:12.266
YEAR-OLD FORMER MEDIA ADVISOR,

06:12.266 --> 06:13.133
EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO TRACK

06:13.133 --> 06:14.633
DOWN THE FATHER OF HIS

06:14.633 --> 06:15.934
GIRLFRIEND, WHO IS NOT THRILLED

06:15.934 --> 06:17.967
WITH BARNABY'S BEHAVIOR.

06:17.967 --> 06:19.333
>> THE MAN WHO COULD BE HIS

06:19.333 --> 06:20.734
FUTURE FATHER-IN-LAW SAYS HE

06:20.734 --> 06:22.200
WANTS THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER

06:22.200 --> 06:24.000
ROASTING ON A SPIT.

06:24.000 --> 06:24.900
>> PETER CAMPION IS BRISTLING

06:24.900 --> 06:26.166
WITH ANGER.

06:26.166 --> 06:27.600
>> I THINK THE DEPUTY P.M.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.633
ON A SPIT WOULD BE, YEAH,

06:29.633 --> 06:32.567
QUITE A SIGHT.

06:32.567 --> 06:34.000
>> John: I THINK THAT MIGHT BE

06:34.000 --> 06:35.033
THE MOST AUSTRALIAN MAN WHO'S

06:35.033 --> 06:37.000
EVER LIVED.

06:37.000 --> 06:37.834
IN AUSTRALIA, THEY DON'T HAVE

06:37.834 --> 06:39.166
SANTA CLAUS.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.467
THEY JUST HAVE THAT GUY COMING

06:40.467 --> 06:41.867
DOWN YOUR CHIMNEY, AND WHETHER

06:41.867 --> 06:43.367
YOU'VE BEEN BAD OR GOOD, HE JUST

06:43.367 --> 06:47.033
BEATS YOU WITH A NEWSPAPER.

06:47.033 --> 06:48.266
AND THE FINAL STOP ON OUR

06:48.266 --> 06:50.133
"TOUR DE SCANDAL" IS ISRAEL.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.300
THE THING YOU BRING UP WHEN ALL

06:51.300 --> 06:52.066
YOUR FRIENDS ARE THE SAME

06:52.066 --> 06:53.200
POLITICAL PARTY, BUT YOU STILL

06:53.200 --> 06:55.567
WANT TO HAVE AN ARGUMENT.

06:55.567 --> 06:57.000
THIS WEEK BROUGHT A NEW SCANDAL

06:57.000 --> 06:59.033
FOR THEIR LEADER.

06:59.033 --> 06:59.767
>> ISRAELI POLICE ARE

06:59.767 --> 07:01.133
RECOMMENDING THAT PRIME MINISTER

07:01.133 --> 07:03.000
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU BE INDICTED

07:03.000 --> 07:04.934
ON TWO CORRUPTION CASES.

07:04.934 --> 07:06.133
THEY INCLUDE CLAIMS THAT

07:06.133 --> 07:06.967
NETANYAHU ACCEPTED MONEY FROM

07:06.967 --> 07:09.000
A HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER AND THAT HE

07:09.000 --> 07:10.734
OFFERED PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT

07:10.734 --> 07:12.300
TO A NEWSPAPER PUBLISHER IN

07:12.300 --> 07:15.233
EXCHANGE FOR POSITIVE COVERAGE.

07:15.233 --> 07:16.033
>> John: OH, THAT'S JUST THE

07:16.033 --> 07:17.200
BEGINNING.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.100
THEY ALSO CHARGED THAT HE

07:18.100 --> 07:18.800
ACCEPTED LAVISH GIFTS FROM

07:18.800 --> 07:19.834
WEALTHY FRIENDS, INCLUDING

07:19.834 --> 07:22.133
NEARLY $300,000 WORTH OF CIGARS

07:22.133 --> 07:23.300
AND CHAMPAGNE.

07:23.300 --> 07:24.400
AND WHILE HE DENIES THESE

07:24.400 --> 07:26.333
CHARGES, NETANYAHU AND HIS WIFE

07:26.333 --> 07:27.367
DO HAVE FAMOUSLY EXTRAVAGANT

07:27.367 --> 07:28.734
TASTES.

07:28.734 --> 07:29.967
SHE'S BEEN DUBBED ISRAEL'S

07:29.967 --> 07:31.734
MARIE ANTOINETTE, WHICH IS BOTH

07:31.734 --> 07:32.934
A HARSH CRITICISM AND AN

07:32.934 --> 07:34.533
OBJECTIVELY CHIC

07:34.533 --> 07:38.433
BAT MITZVAH THEME.

07:38.433 --> 07:39.400
THE DETAILS OF THEIR

07:39.400 --> 07:40.133
SPENDING ARE STRIKING.

07:40.133 --> 07:40.767
OVER THE YEARS, THEY'VE BEEN

07:40.767 --> 07:43.166
ACCUSED OF SPENDING

07:43.166 --> 07:43.900
$1700 OF TAXPAYER MONEY ON

07:43.900 --> 07:47.767
SCENTED CANDLES,

07:47.767 --> 07:48.867
$2700 JUST ON HIGH-END ICE

07:48.867 --> 07:50.800
CREAM, AND IN 2013, NETANYAHU

07:50.800 --> 07:52.967
SPENT $127,000 INSTALLING

07:52.967 --> 07:54.600
A DOUBLE BED ON A PLANE HE'D

07:54.600 --> 07:56.033
CHARTERED TO ATTEND

07:56.033 --> 07:57.767
MARGARET THATCHER'S FUNERAL.

07:57.767 --> 08:00.734
THAT'S ONLY A FIVE-HOUR FLIGHT!

08:00.734 --> 08:02.233
ALTHOUGH, I KIND OF GET IT.

08:02.233 --> 08:03.000
I MEAN, YOU GO TO MARGARET

08:03.000 --> 08:04.533
THATCHER'S FUNERAL, AFTERWARD

08:04.533 --> 08:06.033
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL WORKED UP

08:06.033 --> 08:10.600
AND READY TO FUCK.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.400
AND THE NETANYAHUS' EFFORTS TO

08:12.400 --> 08:14.166
SPIN THEIR USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS

08:14.166 --> 08:14.633
IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN

08:14.633 --> 08:16.000
RIDICULOUS.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.834
A FEW YEARS AGO, THEY EVEN TRIED

08:17.834 --> 08:18.667
TO PREEMPT CRITICISM BY

08:18.667 --> 08:20.133
GIVING A REALITY HOST A TOUR OF

08:20.133 --> 08:22.734
THE OFFICIAL RESIDENCE TO SHOW

08:22.734 --> 08:24.400
THE NATION WHAT A PILE OF SHIT

08:24.400 --> 08:26.400
IT ACTUALLY IS.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.367
AND THE WHOLE THING IS IN PRETTY

08:27.367 --> 08:29.200
BAD TASTE, THERE'S ONE MOMENT

08:29.200 --> 08:30.600
THAT REALLY ELEVATES IT.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.433
SEE IF YOU CAN SPOT IT.

08:33.433 --> 08:34.867
>> THIS DOOR HAS BEEN THROUGH

08:34.867 --> 08:36.467
THOUSANDS OF PAINTINGS.

08:36.467 --> 08:37.233
>> WHAT IS THIS?

08:37.233 --> 08:38.667
>> A LAMP JUST BROKE AND IT WAS

08:38.667 --> 08:39.567
GLUED.

08:39.567 --> 08:41.934
>> WHAT IS THIS?

08:41.934 --> 08:42.500
I'M SORRY, LIKE, WHAT IS

08:42.500 --> 08:43.500
THIS?

08:43.500 --> 08:44.166
WOW, I'M IN SHOCK THAT THIS

08:44.166 --> 08:45.767
IS YOUR KITCHEN.

08:45.767 --> 08:46.934
IT LOOKS LIKE THE KITCHEN OF

08:46.934 --> 08:48.133
A BOARDING SCHOOL IN ROMANIA IN

08:48.133 --> 08:50.133
1954.

08:50.133 --> 08:51.567
WHAT IS THIS HERE IN THE

08:51.567 --> 08:52.200
BACK?

08:52.200 --> 08:53.000
THIS HERE IS THE CLOSET?

08:53.000 --> 08:53.834
I THINK ANNE FRANK IS HIDING

08:53.834 --> 08:55.367
HERE IN THE BACK.

08:55.367 --> 08:58.033
>> John: WOW.

08:58.033 --> 08:58.700
WOW.

08:58.700 --> 08:59.433
WOW.

08:59.433 --> 09:00.967
WOW.

09:00.967 --> 09:02.300
SO, APPARENTLY, AT NO POINT IN

09:02.300 --> 09:03.600
THE EDITING PROCESS FOR THAT DID

09:03.600 --> 09:04.500
ANYONE EITHER IN THE PRIME

09:04.500 --> 09:06.066
MINISTER'S OFFICE OR ELSEWHERE

09:06.066 --> 09:08.166
SAY, "THAT ALL LOOKS GREAT.

09:08.166 --> 09:11.000
MAYBE LOSE THE ANNE FRANK JOKE."

09:11.000 --> 09:11.800
I HALF EXPECTED THAT SOUTH

09:11.800 --> 09:12.767
AFRICAN INTERPRETER TO APPEAR

09:12.767 --> 09:13.967
IN THE CORNER OF THE SCREEN

09:13.967 --> 09:16.400
SAYING, "BOO!"

09:16.400 --> 09:19.233
"BOO!"

09:19.233 --> 09:20.333
AND YET, IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT

09:20.333 --> 09:21.800
HOW DESTABILIZING THE WORLD'S

09:21.800 --> 09:23.333
WEEK HAS BEEN THAT WATCHING

09:23.333 --> 09:24.700
SOMEONE TELL AN ANNE FRANK JOKE

09:24.700 --> 09:26.233
DURING A MEAN-SPIRITED ISRAELI

09:26.233 --> 09:27.400
HOUSE TOUR ISN'T EVEN

09:27.400 --> 09:28.433
THE DUMBEST THING I'VE SEEN

09:28.433 --> 09:29.066
SOMEONE SAY ON TELEVISION.

09:29.066 --> 09:37.266
AND NOW THIS.

09:37.266 --> 09:40.066
>> Announcer: I KNOW FOR

09:40.066 --> 09:43.467
VALENTINE'S DAY, LOCAL NEWS

09:43.467 --> 09:44.767
PRESENTS SOME HEART-SHAPED SHIT.

09:44.767 --> 09:49.500
>> I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW TO

09:49.500 --> 09:51.967
MAKE A HEART SHAPED HARD-BOILED

09:51.967 --> 09:52.633
EGG.

09:52.633 --> 09:53.900
>> HEART-SHAPED BAGELS.

09:53.900 --> 09:56.100
>> HEART-SHAPED BISCUIT.

09:56.100 --> 10:00.233
>> YES, IT IS.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.667
>> HEART-SHAPED WREATH.

10:02.667 --> 10:05.033
>> HEART SHAPED STRAWBERRY.

10:05.033 --> 10:07.467
>> HEART SHAPED PIZZA.

10:07.467 --> 10:09.166
>> SUSHI.

10:09.166 --> 10:11.633
>> TACO BOXES.

10:11.633 --> 10:13.800
>> HEART SHAPED MEAT LOAF

10:13.800 --> 10:14.500
FROSTED WITH MASHED POTATOES.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.133
IT'S JUST FUN.

10:17.133 --> 10:20.200
>> John: MOVING ON.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.200
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

10:21.200 --> 10:21.600
DONALD TRUMP,

10:21.600 --> 10:22.300
THE ONLY PRESIDENT WHO COMBINES

10:22.300 --> 10:23.166
THE SORDID EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIRS

10:23.166 --> 10:23.934
OF A YOUNG JFK WITH THE

10:23.934 --> 10:24.467
DEAD-EYED PUFFINESS

10:24.467 --> 10:25.400
OF A POST-WATERGATE

10:25.400 --> 10:27.266
RICHARD NIXON.

10:27.266 --> 10:29.133
AND LOOK, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

10:29.133 --> 10:30.433
TRUMP A LOT, BUT TONIGHT, WE'D

10:30.433 --> 10:31.300
LIKE TO DO IT FROM A SLIGHTLY

10:31.300 --> 10:32.467
DIFFERENT ANGLE, AND THAT'S

10:32.467 --> 10:33.533
FOCUSING ON HIS RELATIONSHIP

10:33.533 --> 10:35.233
WITH THE WORLD.

10:35.233 --> 10:36.333
WHILE WE WERE AWAY, YOU MAY

10:36.333 --> 10:37.600
REMEMBER ONE PARTICULAR REMARK

10:37.600 --> 10:39.300
HE MADE.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.100
>> ACCORDING TO THE U.S.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.300
PRESIDENT, AFRICA IS A SHITHOLE.

10:42.300 --> 10:45.333
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT.

10:45.333 --> 10:46.233
HE SAID THAT.

10:46.233 --> 10:47.500
EXCEPT, TO BE FAIR TO HIM,

10:47.500 --> 10:48.600
IT'S ACTUALLY WORSE, BECAUSE HE

10:48.600 --> 10:50.734
REPORTEDLY CALLED AFRICA, HAITI,

10:50.734 --> 10:52.266
AND EL SALVADOR SHITHOLES,

10:52.266 --> 10:55.767
WHICH IS JUST NOT OKAY.

10:55.767 --> 10:56.867
AND YES, I PERSONALLY HAVE

10:56.867 --> 10:57.834
CALLED BELGIUM A SHITHOLE

10:57.834 --> 10:59.066
MULTIPLE TIMES, BUT IN MY

10:59.066 --> 11:00.300
DEFENSE, A, I'M NOT A PRESIDENT.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.033
AND B, BELGIUM IS A LOATHSOME

11:02.033 --> 11:03.033
CHOCOLATE GULAG WITH NO

11:03.033 --> 11:10.033
OBJECTIVE REASON TO EXIST.

11:10.033 --> 11:10.934
SO YOU CAN SEE IT'S VERY

11:10.934 --> 11:11.934
DIFFERENT.

11:11.934 --> 11:12.800
AND YOU PROBABLY SAW PEOPLE ON

11:12.800 --> 11:13.900
U.S. TV BEING APPALLED BY HIS

11:13.900 --> 11:14.934
REMARKS.

11:14.934 --> 11:17.433
WHAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE SEEN IS

11:17.433 --> 11:18.734
THE RESPONSES FROM THE COUNTRIES

11:18.734 --> 11:19.700
HE INSULTED.

11:19.700 --> 11:20.533
>> I AM HONESTLY SO SHOCKED,

11:20.533 --> 11:22.166
COUNTRIES?

11:22.166 --> 11:24.166
LIKE, HAS HE EVER BEEN TO THIS

11:24.166 --> 11:25.533
COUNTRY TO CALL IT

11:25.533 --> 11:26.300
A  COUNTRY?

11:26.300 --> 11:27.467
SERIOUSLY?

11:27.467 --> 11:29.233
>> WE NOT SHITHOLE.

11:29.233 --> 11:30.734
WE'RE PEOPLE.

11:30.734 --> 11:32.433
WE'RE JUST LIKE HIM.

11:32.500 --> 11:41.467
>> John: WOW, IT SAYS SOMETHING

11:41.467 --> 11:43.033
ABOUT THE TRUMP ERA THAT THE

11:43.033 --> 11:44.934
PHRASE "THE SAME WORMS WILL EAT

11:44.934 --> 11:46.567
HIM TOO" ACTUALLY QUALIFIES

11:46.567 --> 11:47.367
AS A HOPEFUL THOUGHT.

11:47.367 --> 11:48.433
I WOULD LIKE THAT CROCHETED

11:48.433 --> 11:49.533
ON A PILLOW SO I CAN WAKE UP

11:49.533 --> 11:53.367
TO IT EVERY MORNING!

11:53.367 --> 11:54.567
AND LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT'S

11:54.567 --> 11:55.333
THE ONLY TIME TRUMP'S REMARKS

11:55.333 --> 11:57.967
HAVE CAUSED AN UPROAR.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.333
HE SAID KOREA USED TO BE PART OF

11:59.333 --> 12:00.433
CHINA, WHICH OUTRAGED SOUTH

12:00.433 --> 12:01.967
KOREANS.

12:01.967 --> 12:03.600
HE CLAIMS GERMANY OWES NATO VAST

12:03.600 --> 12:04.700
SUMS OF MONEY, WHICH IT DOES

12:04.700 --> 12:05.967
NOT.

12:05.967 --> 12:07.734
AND IN THE U.K., HE RETWEETED

12:07.734 --> 12:09.266
THESE ANTI-MUSLIM VIDEOS FROM A

12:09.266 --> 12:10.266
FAR-RIGHT BRITISH GROUP, WHICH

12:10.266 --> 12:12.700
TRIGGERED MASSIVE CONDEMNATION.

12:12.700 --> 12:13.433
AND INSTEAD OF FULLY

12:13.433 --> 12:15.133
APOLOGIZING, HE SAID

12:15.133 --> 12:16.467
"IT WAS A BIG STORY WHERE YOU

12:16.467 --> 12:17.967
ARE, BUT IT WAS NOT A BIG STORY

12:17.967 --> 12:19.834
WHERE I AM."

12:19.834 --> 12:21.333
AND THAT IS EXACTLY HIS

12:21.333 --> 12:23.033
ATTITUDE.

12:23.033 --> 12:24.433
"IF IT WASN'T BIG WHERE I COULD

12:24.433 --> 12:26.533
SEE IT, THEN IT WASN'T BIG."

12:26.533 --> 12:27.767
FORGET MASTERING FOREIGN

12:27.767 --> 12:28.233
AFFAIRS.

12:28.233 --> 12:29.133
TRUMP MAY NOT HAVE MASTERED

12:29.133 --> 12:30.567
OBJECT PERMANENCE,

12:30.567 --> 12:32.233
WHICH YOU NEED TO BE

12:32.233 --> 12:37.533
A GOOD PRESIDENT OR A GOOD BABY.

12:37.533 --> 12:39.633
AND YET, HERE'S THE THING.

12:39.633 --> 12:40.900
THE REST OF THE WORLD CONTINUES

12:40.900 --> 12:41.567
TO EXIST WHETHER TRUMP

12:41.567 --> 12:43.400
ACKNOWLEDGES IT OR NOT.

12:43.400 --> 12:44.233
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TRY AND ANSWER

12:44.233 --> 12:46.567
A FEW BASIC QUESTIONS.

12:46.567 --> 12:48.233
FIRST, WHAT IS DONALD TRUMP'S

12:48.233 --> 12:49.600
FOREIGN POLICY?

12:49.600 --> 12:50.834
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE LITTLE

12:50.834 --> 12:51.433
MORE THAN REPEATING A SINGLE

12:51.433 --> 12:52.533
PHRASE.

12:52.533 --> 12:54.533
>> I WILL ALWAYS PUT AMERICA

12:54.533 --> 12:55.066
FIRST.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.500
AMERICA FIRST.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.967
AMERICA FIRST!

12:58.967 --> 13:00.200
AMERICA FIRST AGAIN.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.500
AMERICA FIRST.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.100
AMERICA FIRST.

13:03.100 --> 13:04.433
IT WILL BE AMERICA FIRST

13:04.433 --> 13:06.400
FROM NOW ON.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.967
AMERICA FIRST.

13:08.967 --> 13:10.367
>> John: IF YOU'RE ANOTHER

13:10.367 --> 13:11.867
COUNTRY WATCHING THAT, YOU HAVE

13:11.867 --> 13:12.800
TO WONDER: "WAIT, WHEN HAS

13:12.800 --> 13:14.467
AMERICA'S ATTITUDE EVER NOT BEEN

13:14.467 --> 13:16.033
"AMERICA FIRST"?

13:16.033 --> 13:17.600
THEY'VE BEEN PUTTING AMERICA

13:17.600 --> 13:19.567
FIRST SINCE THE DAY THEY ARRIVED

13:19.567 --> 13:22.700
IN AMERICA VERY MUCH SECOND.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.333
BUT TO HEAR DONALD TRUMP TELL

13:24.333 --> 13:25.734
IT, IN RECENT YEARS, WE'VE BEEN

13:25.734 --> 13:26.533
GETTING THE SHORT END OF THE

13:26.533 --> 13:27.400
STICK.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.767
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, HE OFTEN

13:28.767 --> 13:29.934
COMPLAINED THAT AMERICA HAD

13:29.934 --> 13:31.500
BECOME A GLOBAL PUNCHLINE AND

13:31.500 --> 13:32.633
PROMISED THAT HE COULD REVERSE

13:32.633 --> 13:35.066
IT.

13:35.066 --> 13:36.200
>> THE WORLD IS LAUGHING AT US,

13:36.200 --> 13:36.667
FOLKS.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.133
THE WHOLE WORLD IS LAUGHING AT

13:38.133 --> 13:45.834
US.

13:45.834 --> 13:46.700
THEY'RE LAUGHING AT THIS, AT

13:46.700 --> 13:47.333
WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY.

13:47.333 --> 13:48.000
THE WORLD LAUGHS AT US, FOLKS.

13:48.000 --> 13:48.667
THE WORLD LAUGHS AT US.

13:48.667 --> 13:49.433
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE A

13:49.433 --> 13:50.200
LAUGHINGSTOCK LIKE WE HAVE BEEN,

13:50.200 --> 13:51.734
AND WE HAVE BEEN, BELIEVE ME.

13:51.734 --> 13:52.767
>> John: OH, WE'RE NOT GOING TO

13:52.767 --> 13:55.467
BE A LAUGHINGSTOCK, ARE WE?

13:55.467 --> 13:56.467
IT'S INSANE THAT TRUMP --

13:56.467 --> 13:57.767
THIS GUY,

13:57.767 --> 13:59.233
THIS GUY,

13:59.233 --> 14:01.233
THIS GUY --

14:01.233 --> 14:02.033
THOUGHT HE WOULD END THE

14:02.033 --> 14:03.600
LAUGHTER.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.667
IT'S LIKE A FLAMINGO

14:04.667 --> 14:05.700
IN BOXER SHORTS NAMED

14:05.700 --> 14:06.633
FINNEAS J. ROCKETDUMP

14:06.633 --> 14:07.333
RAN FOR PRESIDENT

14:07.333 --> 14:08.867
UNDER THE SLOGAN:

14:08.867 --> 14:12.233
"TIME TO GET SERIOUS."

14:12.233 --> 14:13.667
NOW, FOR THE RECORD, SINCE TRUMP

14:13.667 --> 14:14.700
BECAME PRESIDENT, IF ANYTHING,

14:14.700 --> 14:15.600
THE WORLD IS LAUGHING HARDER

14:15.600 --> 14:17.300
THAN EVER.

14:17.300 --> 14:18.000
BECAUSE WHILE ALL U.S.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.333
PRESIDENTS GET MADE FUN OF,

14:20.333 --> 14:21.800
IMPERSONATING TRUMP HAS BECOME

14:21.800 --> 14:22.734
AN INTERNATIONAL COTTAGE

14:22.734 --> 14:24.333
INDUSTRY.

14:24.333 --> 14:26.100
ISRAEL HAS TRUMP KICKING A

14:26.100 --> 14:27.600
MUSLIM MAN WHILE DANCING LEWDLY

14:27.600 --> 14:29.300
TO GUNS N' ROSES.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.734
GERMANY HAS HIM

14:30.734 --> 14:32.667
DANCING TO "UPTOWN FUNK".

14:32.667 --> 14:34.367
SPAIN HAS HIM FLIPPING OFF THE

14:34.367 --> 14:35.667
WORLD AND, AGAIN, DANCING LIKE

14:35.667 --> 14:36.600
AN IDIOT.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.900
AND THERE'S MORE.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.133
HERE HE IS IN PAKISTAN.

14:40.133 --> 14:42.000
HERE HE IS IN BULGARIA.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.500
HERE HE IS IN TAIWAN.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.467
HERE HE IS IN ETHIOPIA.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.166
HERE'S A PRETTY SHITTY ONE FROM

14:47.166 --> 14:47.767
TURKEY WHERE THEY'RE NOT EVEN

14:47.767 --> 14:49.166
TRYING.

14:49.166 --> 14:50.667
HERE'S A KOREAN TRUMP, AND

14:50.667 --> 14:52.100
HERE'S ONE FROM AN ITALIAN

14:52.100 --> 14:53.333
COMEDY SHOW SINGING "BORN IN THE

14:53.333 --> 14:54.700
U.S.A." ON A STEALTH FIGHTER

14:54.700 --> 14:56.200
BEFORE BEING TAKEN OUT WITH

14:56.200 --> 14:59.133
A BUCKET ON HIS HEAD.

14:59.133 --> 15:00.567
ARE ANY OF THESE FUNNY?

15:00.567 --> 15:01.767
I DON'T KNOW.

15:01.767 --> 15:02.500
IS ANYTHING ABOUT TRUMP FUNNY

15:02.500 --> 15:04.266
ANYMORE?

15:04.266 --> 15:05.233
SOMEHOW THE WORLD'S MOST

15:05.233 --> 15:06.500
OBJECTIVELY LAUGHABLE HUMAN HAS

15:06.500 --> 15:07.867
BECOME A COMEDY GRAVEYARD WHERE

15:07.867 --> 15:10.533
LAUGHTER GOES TO DIE.

15:10.533 --> 15:12.467
AND IN CASE YOU THINK ANY OF

15:12.467 --> 15:14.333
THAT WAS GOOD-NATURED RIBBING,

15:14.333 --> 15:15.767
A RECENT GALLUP POLL SHOWS THAT

15:15.767 --> 15:16.400
THE WORLD'S APPROVAL RATING OF

15:16.400 --> 15:18.467
U.S. LEADERSHIP HAS DROPPED TO

15:18.467 --> 15:21.300
30% AFTER BEING AT NEARLY 50%

15:21.300 --> 15:23.033
JUST TWO YEARS BEFORE.

15:23.033 --> 15:23.934
THAT IS A PRECIPITOUS DROP IN

15:23.934 --> 15:25.900
POPULARITY.

15:25.900 --> 15:27.934
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF REPLACING

15:27.934 --> 15:29.433
GAL GADOT IN THE "WONDER WOMAN"

15:29.433 --> 15:34.900
FRANCHISE WITH MATT LAUER.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.000
AND I KNOW DONALD TRUMP AND

15:37.000 --> 15:38.934
OTHERS MAY NOT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT

15:38.934 --> 15:40.233
WHAT THE WORLD THINKS ABOUT US.

15:40.233 --> 15:42.633
BUT THEY SHOULD, FOR A NUMBER OF

15:42.633 --> 15:43.734
REASONS, CHIEF AMONG THEM

15:43.734 --> 15:44.867
SOMETHING CALLED

15:44.867 --> 15:47.133
SOFT POWER, WHICH, YES, DOES

15:47.133 --> 15:47.934
SOUND LIKE AN ERECTILE

15:47.934 --> 15:48.667
DYSFUNCTION MEDICATION FOR

15:48.667 --> 15:50.867
CHINCHILLAS.

15:50.867 --> 15:57.066
SO SOFT, YET SO HARD.

15:57.066 --> 15:58.433
BUT IT BASICALLY REFERS TO THE

15:58.433 --> 15:59.633
ABILITY TO GET OTHERS TO DO WHAT

15:59.633 --> 16:01.033
YOU WANT THEM TO DO WITHOUT

16:01.033 --> 16:03.266
USING CARROTS OR STICKS.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.200
IT'S KIND OF A COUNTRY'S BRAND.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.467
AND A NATION'S SOFT POWER CAN

16:06.467 --> 16:07.300
COME FROM MANY SOURCES --

16:07.300 --> 16:08.800
FROM YOUR POP CULTURE

16:08.800 --> 16:10.667
TO THE IDEALS YOU EXPRESS

16:10.667 --> 16:12.066
TO YOUR REPUTATION.

16:12.066 --> 16:12.667
AND DIPLOMACY CAN PLAY A MAJOR

16:12.667 --> 16:14.834
PART IN IT.

16:14.834 --> 16:16.166
EVEN HARD POWER PRACTITIONERS,

16:16.166 --> 16:19.033
LIKE TRUMP'S SECRETARY OF

16:19.033 --> 16:20.433
DEFENSE, JIM "MAD DOG" MATTIS,

16:20.433 --> 16:22.567
SUPPORTS THE SOFT POWER WORK

16:22.567 --> 16:23.100
THAT'S DONE

16:23.100 --> 16:24.100
BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT.

16:24.100 --> 16:25.567
THAT'S WHY, A FEW YEARS BACK, HE

16:25.567 --> 16:26.500
GAVE A FULL-THROATED DEFENSE OF

16:26.500 --> 16:28.200
PROPERLY FUNDING IT.

16:28.200 --> 16:31.467
>> FRANKLY, THEY NEED TO BE AS

16:31.467 --> 16:32.700
FULLY FUNDED AS CONGRESS

16:32.700 --> 16:35.233
BELIEVES APPROPRIATE, BECAUSE IF

16:35.233 --> 16:38.400
YOU DON'T FUND THE STATE

16:38.400 --> 16:40.000
DEPARTMENT FULLY, THEN I NEED TO

16:40.000 --> 16:42.934
BUY MORE AMMUNITION, ULTIMATELY.

16:42.934 --> 16:45.133
>> John: NOW, THAT'S SCARY,

16:45.133 --> 16:50.233
BECAUSE "BUY MORE AMMUNITION" IS

16:50.233 --> 16:51.400
HIS WAY OF SAYING

16:51.400 --> 16:52.400
"WITHOUT DIPLOMACY,

16:52.400 --> 16:53.533
THERE WILL BE MORE WARS."

16:53.533 --> 16:54.367
HE DOESN'T NEED MORE AMMUNITION

16:54.367 --> 16:55.166
SO HE CAN MAKE

16:55.166 --> 16:56.000
BULLET EARRINGS FOR HIS ETSY

16:56.000 --> 16:56.633
STORE, BECAUSE HE'S NOT JUST

16:56.633 --> 16:57.467
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, HE ALSO

16:57.467 --> 16:58.300
CRAFTS ACCESSORIES FOR THE

16:58.300 --> 16:59.567
ELEGANT WEIRDO.

16:59.567 --> 17:01.133
UNFORTUNATELY, TRUMP HAS SHOWN

17:01.133 --> 17:02.233
LITTLE INTEREST IN SOFT POWER.

17:02.233 --> 17:03.767
HIS ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY

17:03.767 --> 17:05.600
PROPOSED A 29% CUT TO THE STATE

17:05.600 --> 17:07.166
DEPARTMENT AND FOREIGN AID,

17:07.166 --> 17:08.066
AND THERE ARE MANY HIGH-LEVEL

17:08.066 --> 17:09.467
VACANCIES AT THE STATE

17:09.467 --> 17:10.867
DEPARTMENT, TO SAY NOTHING OF

17:10.867 --> 17:15.400
OUR LACK OF AMBASSADORS.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.800
>> FROM BELGIUM TO BELIZE,

17:16.800 --> 17:18.467
SOUTH KOREA TO SOUTH AFRICA,

17:18.467 --> 17:20.033
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS A PROBLEM.

17:20.033 --> 17:21.100
HIS EMBASSIES HAVE NO

17:21.100 --> 17:22.333
AMBASSADOR.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.333
TURKEY, JORDAN, EGYPT, QATAR AND

17:24.333 --> 17:25.567
SAUDI ARABIA ALL WITHOUT

17:25.567 --> 17:29.467
AMBASSADORS.

17:29.467 --> 17:30.467
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

17:30.467 --> 17:31.200
SOUTH KOREA, TURKEY AND SAUDI

17:31.200 --> 17:32.000
ARABIA.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
THOSE ARE COUNTRIES WHERE YOU

17:33.000 --> 17:34.967
REALLY NEED AN AMBASSADOR.

17:34.967 --> 17:36.133
IT'S NOT LIKE LICHTENSTEIN,

17:36.133 --> 17:38.233
WHERE YOU CAN SCRAPE BY WITH

17:38.233 --> 17:39.700
A SIGN THAT SAYS

17:39.700 --> 17:42.100
"NEVER STOP LICHTENSTEIN-ING!"

17:42.100 --> 17:42.967
AND AS FOR THE AMBASSADORS TRUMP

17:42.967 --> 17:44.166
HAS APPOINTED, SOME ARE NOT

17:44.166 --> 17:45.600
GREAT.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.033
WHEN TRUMP APPOINTED PETE

17:48.033 --> 17:48.967
HOEKSTRA AS AMBASSADOR TO THE

17:48.967 --> 17:50.133
NETHERLANDS, THEY WERE A LITTLE

17:50.133 --> 17:51.900
UPSET, AS THIS INTERVIEW SHOWS.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.700
>> SPEAKING OF THREATS, AT ONE

17:53.700 --> 17:59.867
POINT, YOU MENTIONED IN A DEBATE

17:59.867 --> 18:00.767
THAT THERE ARE "NO-GO ZONES" IN

18:00.767 --> 18:02.233
THE NETHERLANDS AND THAT CARS

18:02.233 --> 18:03.600
AND POLITICIANS ARE BEING SET ON

18:03.600 --> 18:04.433
FIRE IN THE NETHERLANDS.

18:04.433 --> 18:05.433
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

18:05.433 --> 18:06.867
THAT IS ACTUALLY AN INCORRECT

18:06.867 --> 18:09.867
STATEMENT.

18:09.867 --> 18:12.967
WE WOULD CALL IT FAKE NEWS.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.000
>> John: "I DIDN'T SAY THAT."

18:14.000 --> 18:14.800
HE'S GIVEN HIMSELF SOME WIGGLE

18:14.800 --> 18:15.533
ROOM THERE.

18:15.533 --> 18:16.767
AS LONG AS HE DIDN'T SAY EXACTLY

18:16.767 --> 18:19.433
WHAT THE REPORTER JUST CLAIMED,

18:19.433 --> 18:20.266
ABOUT "NO-GO ZONES" AND

18:20.266 --> 18:21.000
POLITICIANS BEING SET ON FIRE,

18:21.000 --> 18:22.567
HE'S TECHNICALLY CORRECT.

18:22.567 --> 18:25.100
THE ONLY THING IN THE WORLD THAT

18:25.100 --> 18:28.667
WOULD MAKE HIM NOT CORRECT IS

18:28.667 --> 18:30.600
IF VIDEO OF HIM SAYING THAT CARS

18:30.600 --> 18:31.600
AND POLITICIANS ARE BEING

18:31.600 --> 18:32.233
BURNED, AND THAT, YES, THERE ARE

18:32.233 --> 18:34.700
NO-GO ZONES IN THE NETHERLANDS.

18:34.700 --> 18:35.967
>> THERE ARE CARS BEING BURNED.

18:35.967 --> 18:37.400
THERE ARE POLITICIANS THAT ARE

18:37.400 --> 18:38.834
BEING BURNED.

18:38.834 --> 18:40.266
AND YES, THERE ARE "NO-GO ZONES"

18:40.266 --> 18:44.266
IN THE NETHERLANDS.

18:44.266 --> 18:46.033
>> John: IT'S PRETTY WEIRD NOT

18:46.033 --> 18:47.400
TO RECALL SAYING OUT LOUD "THERE

18:47.400 --> 18:48.400
ARE POLITICIANS THAT ARE BEING

18:48.400 --> 18:50.767
BURNED" IN THE NETHERLANDS.

18:50.767 --> 18:51.667
THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF THING YOU

18:51.667 --> 18:53.133
DO AND IMMEDIATELY FORGET ABOUT,

18:53.133 --> 18:54.333
LIKE DRIVING TO WORK OR SEEING

18:54.333 --> 18:58.000
THE MOVIE "THE POST."

18:58.000 --> 18:58.767
I HAVE A VAGUE MEMORY OF

18:58.767 --> 18:59.633
WALKING INTO A DARKENED ROOM,

18:59.633 --> 19:00.500
EATING MILK DUDS, AND THINKING

19:00.500 --> 19:06.033
"MERYL STREEP IS A TREASURE,"

19:06.033 --> 19:07.367
BUT THE REST IS A COMPLETE

19:07.367 --> 19:08.166
BLANK.

19:08.166 --> 19:09.066
BUT WHEN TRUMP WAS ASKED ABOUT

19:09.066 --> 19:10.066
HIS UNDER-STAFFED STATE

19:10.066 --> 19:10.700
DEPARTMENT, HE CLAIMED IT DIDN'T

19:10.700 --> 19:11.233
REALLY MATTER, FOR ONE KEY

19:11.233 --> 19:12.600
REASON.

19:12.600 --> 19:13.633
>> LET ME TELL YOU, THE ONE THAT

19:13.633 --> 19:14.767
MATTERS IS ME.

19:14.767 --> 19:16.000
I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT MATTERS

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO IT,

19:17.000 --> 19:18.100
THAT'S WHAT THE POLICY IS GOING

19:18.100 --> 19:19.033
TO BE.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.867
>> John: "I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT

19:20.867 --> 19:22.800
MATTERS.

19:22.800 --> 19:23.734
THE ONLY ONE THAT

19:23.734 --> 19:24.166
MATTERS IS ME."

19:24.166 --> 19:24.934
IT'S HARD TO TELL IF

19:24.934 --> 19:25.734
DONALD TRUMP IS LAYING OUT

19:25.734 --> 19:27.100
A DIPLOMATIC STRATEGY OR

19:27.100 --> 19:28.266
DEMANDING THAT DADDY BUY HIM

19:28.266 --> 19:34.867
AN OOMPA LOOMPA "NOW!"

19:34.867 --> 19:37.300
BUT OKAY, OKAY.

19:37.300 --> 19:38.333
IF TRUMP IS THE ONLY ONE

19:38.333 --> 19:38.900
THAT MATTERS, THEN HIS

19:38.900 --> 19:39.533
ACTIONS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR

19:39.533 --> 19:40.166
NATION'S FOREIGN POLICY.

19:40.166 --> 19:41.200
AND THAT BRINGS US TO OUR NEXT

19:41.200 --> 19:42.233
QUESTION.

19:42.233 --> 19:42.900
HOW'S HIS APPROACH TO THE WORLD

19:42.900 --> 19:44.333
GOING?

19:44.333 --> 19:45.834
THE ANSWER, SURPRISINGLY,

19:45.834 --> 19:47.333
IS GREAT!

19:47.333 --> 19:50.133
AND NOW THIS!

19:50.133 --> 19:51.300
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

19:51.300 --> 19:52.500
I'M KIDDING.

19:52.500 --> 19:56.500
IT'S BEEN A FUCKING DISASTER.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.533
IN FACT, TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF

19:58.533 --> 20:00.600
HOW MUCH DAMAGE HE CAN DO IN

20:00.600 --> 20:07.734
VERY LITTLE TIME, LOOK AT LAST

20:07.734 --> 20:09.600
SUMMER'S BACK-TO-BACK NATO

20:09.600 --> 20:11.033
AND G7 SUMMITS.

20:11.033 --> 20:11.934
IT WAS JUST THREE DAYS OF

20:11.934 --> 20:13.734
MEETINGS, IN WHICH TIME HE

20:13.734 --> 20:14.900
REPORTEDLY TOLD EUROPEAN LEADERS

20:14.900 --> 20:16.800
THAT QUOTE "THE GERMANS ARE BAD,

20:16.800 --> 20:19.233
VERY BAD."

20:19.233 --> 20:20.700
AND THEN SHOOK EMMANUEL MACRON'S

20:20.700 --> 20:22.166
HAND SO AGGRESSIVELY,

20:22.166 --> 20:23.433
IT SEEMED LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO

20:23.433 --> 20:26.633
MASTURBATE AN ELEPHANT.

20:26.633 --> 20:28.033
THEN, AT THE G-7 CONFERENCE THE

20:28.033 --> 20:28.533
NEXT DAY, WORLD LEADERS

20:28.533 --> 20:29.500
UNSUCCESSFULLY TRIED TO CONVINCE

20:29.500 --> 20:31.033
HIM TO STAY IN THE PARIS CLIMATE

20:31.033 --> 20:32.533
ACCORD.

20:32.533 --> 20:33.567
AND IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THAT,

20:33.567 --> 20:35.166
HE GAVE A SPEECH WHERE HE FAILED

20:35.166 --> 20:35.767
TO EXPLICITLY REAFFIRM ARTICLE

20:35.767 --> 20:37.166
FIVE, THE BASIC PRINCIPLE THAT

20:37.166 --> 20:39.100
NATO MEMBERS SHOULD COME TO THE

20:39.100 --> 20:41.667
AID OF EACH OTHER WHEN ATTACKED.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.133
AFFIRMING IT IS ROUTINE FOR

20:43.133 --> 20:45.066
PRESIDENTS, AND WAS EVEN IN

20:45.066 --> 20:46.834
TRUMP'S SPEECH, UNTIL

20:46.834 --> 20:47.700
BEING APPARENTLY DELETED AT THE

20:47.700 --> 20:49.367
LAST MINUTE, BLINDSIDING TOP

20:49.367 --> 20:50.934
MEMBERS OF HIS OWN NATIONAL

20:50.934 --> 20:52.934
SECURITY TEAM.

20:52.934 --> 20:53.867
AND AFTER WITNESSING TRUMP'S

20:53.867 --> 20:54.967
ERRATIC BEHAVIOR FOR JUST THREE

20:54.967 --> 20:57.433
DAYS, ANGELA MERKEL WAS SO

20:57.433 --> 20:58.500
SHELL-SHOCKED, SHE MADE THIS

20:58.500 --> 21:01.233
STATEMENT.

21:01.300 --> 21:13.300
>> THE TIMES IN WHICH WE COULD

21:13.300 --> 21:14.333
DEPEND ON OTHERS ARE,

21:14.333 --> 21:15.400
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, OVER.

21:15.400 --> 21:15.967
I'VE EXPERIENCED THAT IN THE

21:15.967 --> 21:16.700
LAST FEW DAYS.

21:16.700 --> 21:17.567
AND THAT IS WHY WE EUROPEANS

21:17.567 --> 21:18.166
MUST REALLY TAKE OUR FATE INTO

21:18.166 --> 21:18.500
OUR OWN HANDS.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.367
>> John: THAT WAS THE DAY AFTER

21:19.367 --> 21:19.767
THE SUMMIT!

21:19.767 --> 21:20.467
MERKEL WASN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO

21:20.467 --> 21:21.300
GIVE A MAJOR SPEECH.

21:21.300 --> 21:22.433
THAT WAS AT A CAMPAIGN EVENT

21:22.433 --> 21:23.433
HELD IN A BEER TENT!

21:23.433 --> 21:24.266
WE'RE PROBABLY LUCKY THERE WAS

21:24.266 --> 21:25.066
AN EVENT OF ANY KIND, OTHERWISE

21:25.066 --> 21:26.600
SHE WOULD HAVE YELLED,

21:26.600 --> 21:27.900
"EUROPE IS ON ITS OWN!"

21:27.900 --> 21:32.166
AT HER NEPHEW'S PIANO RECITAL.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.700
AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE FINAL

21:33.700 --> 21:34.700
QUESTION.

21:34.700 --> 21:35.934
WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF

21:35.934 --> 21:37.567
THIS?

21:37.567 --> 21:39.467
WELL, ONE BIG ONE COULD BE THAT

21:39.467 --> 21:40.500
THERE'S A LEADERSHIP VACUUM IN

21:40.500 --> 21:42.700
THE WORLD, SO WHO WILL FILL IT?

21:42.700 --> 21:43.567
IN EUROPE, THE OBVIOUS CANDIDATE

21:43.567 --> 21:45.633
IS GERMANY.

21:45.633 --> 21:47.400
BUT EVEN THEY KNOW THERE MAY BE

21:47.400 --> 21:48.834
AN ISSUE WITH THAT.

21:48.834 --> 21:50.433
>> WELL, WHENEVER I TALK TO

21:50.433 --> 21:51.834
PEOPLE IN OUR NEIGHBOR

21:51.834 --> 21:53.700
COUNTRIES, THEY MOSTLY EXPECT

21:53.700 --> 21:54.500
SORT OF THEIR LEADERSHIP OF

21:54.500 --> 21:55.800
GERMANY.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.600
BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE, WHENEVER

21:57.600 --> 21:58.800
I TALK TO THE PEOPLE IN THESE

21:58.800 --> 21:59.967
COUNTRIES WITH A VERY GOOD

21:59.967 --> 22:01.300
MEMORY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

22:01.300 --> 22:03.934
FIRST HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY,

22:03.934 --> 22:04.767
THEY'RE VERY RELUCTANT TALKING

22:04.767 --> 22:10.433
ABOUT THE GERMAN LEADERSHIP.

22:10.433 --> 22:14.433
>> John: YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.500
SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.266
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BRING

22:16.266 --> 22:17.700
IT UP FIRST, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:17.700 --> 22:18.567
WHEN PEOPLE HEAR "GERMANY WANTS

22:18.567 --> 22:19.834
TO TAKE A LEADING ROLE IN

22:19.834 --> 22:23.066
EUROPE," MOST OF US THINK,

22:23.066 --> 22:23.934
"NO, THEY'RE STILL ON TIME-OUT,

22:23.934 --> 22:27.400
AND THEY KNOW WHY."

22:27.400 --> 22:29.967
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY DID.

22:29.967 --> 22:31.667
NAUGHTY GERMANY.

22:31.667 --> 22:32.400
GLOBALLY, IT SEEMS CHINA IS

22:32.400 --> 22:33.033
SET TO BE THE BIGGEST

22:33.033 --> 22:34.633
BENEFICIARY.

22:34.633 --> 22:35.400
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN

22:35.400 --> 22:36.467
AGGRESSIVELY SEEKING TO INCREASE

22:36.467 --> 22:37.533
THEIR INFLUENCE AND SOFT POWER,

22:37.533 --> 22:38.300
SOMETHING THAT HASN'T GONE

22:38.300 --> 22:40.233
UNNOTICED.

22:40.233 --> 22:41.567
>> AN ASIAN HEAD OF GOVERNMENT

22:41.567 --> 22:42.433
RECENTLY EXPLAINED TO ME THAT AT

22:42.433 --> 22:44.433
EVERY REGIONAL CONFERENCE,

22:44.433 --> 22:45.834
WASHINGTON SENDS A COUPLE OF

22:45.834 --> 22:50.533
DIPLOMATS, WHEREAS BEIJING SENDS

22:50.533 --> 22:51.800
DOZENS.

22:51.800 --> 22:52.633
THE CHINESE ARE THERE AT EVERY

22:52.633 --> 22:53.166
COMMITTEE MEETING, AND YOU

22:53.166 --> 22:57.100
ARE NOT, HE SAID.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.433
THE RESULT, HE EXPLAINED,

22:58.433 --> 22:59.567
IS THAT BEIJING IS INCREASINGLY

22:59.567 --> 23:02.266
SETTING THE ASIAN AGENDA.

23:02.266 --> 23:03.734
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

23:03.734 --> 23:04.200
THE U.S. IS ABSENT AT

23:04.200 --> 23:04.834
MANY IMPORTANT MEETINGS.

23:04.834 --> 23:05.567
AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN INCLUDE

23:05.567 --> 23:06.333
MEETINGS JARED KUSHNER WAS

23:06.333 --> 23:07.233
SUPPOSED TO ATTEND, BUT HE

23:07.233 --> 23:08.533
COULDN'T FIND THE ROOM, AND HE

23:08.533 --> 23:09.533
WAS TOO SHY TO ASK SOMEONE, AND

23:09.533 --> 23:10.734
THEN HE REALIZED IT WAS TOO LATE

23:10.734 --> 23:11.667
ANYWAY, SO HE JUST KILLED

23:11.667 --> 23:12.500
AN HOUR WANDERING AROUND THE

23:12.500 --> 23:13.333
LOBBY PRETENDING TO BE

23:13.333 --> 23:18.567
ON THE PHONE.

23:18.567 --> 23:20.000
AND THE THING IS, CHINA'S

23:20.000 --> 23:21.333
INCREASED INFLUENCE SHOULD BE

23:21.333 --> 23:22.266
ALARMING BECAUSE THEY'RE AN

23:22.266 --> 23:23.066
AUTOCRATIC COUNTRY.

23:23.066 --> 23:24.767
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT CHINA

23:24.767 --> 23:25.834
SETTING GLOBAL PRIORITIES

23:25.834 --> 23:27.200
ON THINGS LIKE HUMAN RIGHTS

23:27.200 --> 23:29.200
AND DEMOCRACY.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.400
AND YET, TRUMP'S RECKLESS

23:30.400 --> 23:31.600
BEHAVIOR IS OPENING THE DOOR

23:31.600 --> 23:33.500
TO EXACTLY THAT HAPPENING.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.033
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT

23:35.033 --> 23:36.000
WHAT HE'S DOING IS GOING TO MAKE

23:36.000 --> 23:37.033
IT HARDER FOR HIM TO ACCOMPLISH

23:37.033 --> 23:38.967
HIS OWN GOALS.

23:38.967 --> 23:39.533
HE WANTS TO CONTAIN

23:39.533 --> 23:40.533
NORTH KOREA?

23:40.533 --> 23:41.934
WELL, TO DO THAT, YOU MIGHT WANT

23:41.934 --> 23:42.667
TO APPOINT AN AMBASSADOR TO

23:42.667 --> 23:44.066
SOUTH KOREA.

23:44.066 --> 23:45.433
HE WANTS GERMANY TO SPEND MORE

23:45.433 --> 23:48.266
ON ITS MILITARY?

23:48.266 --> 23:49.667
OKAY, MAYBE STOP PUBLICLY

23:49.667 --> 23:51.166
SHAMING MERKEL IF YOU WANT HER

23:51.166 --> 23:52.667
TO BE ABLE TO SELL THAT IDEA AT

23:52.667 --> 23:54.166
HOME.

23:54.166 --> 23:54.900
AND IF HE WANTS TO CONTAIN

23:54.900 --> 23:55.767
SECURITY THREATS LIKE ISIS

23:55.767 --> 23:57.800
AND AL SHABAAB IN AFRICA,

23:57.800 --> 24:01.667
MAYBE DON'T CALL THE WHOLE

24:01.667 --> 24:03.266
CONTINENT A FUCKING SHITHOLE.

24:03.266 --> 24:05.633
AND THAT'S THE THING.

24:05.633 --> 24:06.734
TRUMP CAN SAY HE DOESN'T CARE,

24:06.734 --> 24:07.333
BECAUSE HIS APPROACH IS

24:07.333 --> 24:08.767
"AMERICA FIRST."

24:08.767 --> 24:10.166
BUT YOU NEED ALLIES TO GET

24:10.166 --> 24:13.000
ANYTHING DONE.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.467
FOREIGN AFFAIRS IS LIKE SEX.

24:14.467 --> 24:15.667
IF YOU LOUDLY ANNOUNCE THAT YOU

24:15.667 --> 24:17.400
WILL ALWAYS COME FIRST,

24:17.400 --> 24:18.567
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TROUBLE

24:18.567 --> 24:21.567
FINDING PARTNERS.

24:21.567 --> 24:23.166
AND AS FOR TRUMP'S OTHER

24:23.166 --> 24:24.066
PROMISE, THAT THE WORLD WILL

24:24.066 --> 24:25.700
STOP LAUGHING, IT'S NOT JUST

24:25.700 --> 24:26.934
COMEDIANS DOING IT.

24:26.934 --> 24:28.100
IT'S WORLD LEADERS.

24:28.100 --> 24:28.867
AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER

24:28.867 --> 24:30.433
MALCOLM TURNBULL WAS AT

24:30.433 --> 24:32.633
A PRESS DINNER LAST YEAR AND HAD

24:32.633 --> 24:35.900
HIMSELF A BIT OF FUN.

24:35.900 --> 24:38.133
>> THE DONALD AND I,

24:38.133 --> 24:39.533
WE ARE WINNING AND WINNING

24:39.533 --> 24:40.867
IN THE POLLS.

24:40.867 --> 24:43.967
WE ARE WINNING SO MUCH.

24:43.967 --> 24:45.200
WE ARE WINNING LIKE WE HAVE

24:45.200 --> 24:46.467
NEVER WON BEFORE.

24:46.467 --> 24:48.500
NOT THE FAKE POLLS,

24:48.500 --> 24:51.533
NOT THE FAKE POLLS!

24:51.533 --> 24:52.233
THEY'RE THE ONES WE'RE NOT

24:52.233 --> 24:54.200
WINNING IN.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.667
WE'RE WINNING IN THE REAL POLLS.

24:56.667 --> 24:59.166
YOU KNOW, THE ONLINE POLLS.

24:59.166 --> 25:01.600
THEY ARE SO EASY TO WIN.

25:01.600 --> 25:06.467
I HAVE THIS RUSSIAN GUY.

25:06.467 --> 25:07.066
BELIEVE ME.

25:07.066 --> 25:08.033
IT'S TRUE.

25:08.033 --> 25:11.667
IT IS TRUE.

25:11.667 --> 25:12.967
>> John: THAT'S A KEY ALLY USING

25:12.967 --> 25:14.367
THE FACT THAT OUR PRESIDENT IS A

25:14.367 --> 25:16.900
PATHOLOGICAL LIAR AS A PUNCHLINE

25:16.900 --> 25:18.266
AND CRUSHING A ROOM

25:18.266 --> 25:21.600
LIKE A FOURTH GRADER WITH

25:21.600 --> 25:24.133
CARROT STICKS UP HIS NOSE.

25:24.133 --> 25:25.800
AND IF YOU THINK THAT'S GRIM,

25:25.800 --> 25:27.266
LET ME SHOW YOU ONE MORE CLIP WE

25:27.266 --> 25:28.066
FOUND WHEN WE WERE LOOKING FOR

25:28.066 --> 25:28.667
TRUMP IMPERSONATORS AROUND THE

25:28.667 --> 25:29.633
WORLD.

25:29.633 --> 25:30.900
IT'S FROM RUSSIAN TV,

25:30.900 --> 25:32.467
WITH A COMEDIAN MAKING FUN OF

25:32.467 --> 25:34.000
TRUMP'S SUSPICIOUSLY CLOSE

25:34.000 --> 25:35.333
RELATIONSHIP TO PUTIN, AND

25:35.333 --> 25:36.867
THERE'S A FUN LITTLE SURPRISE AT

25:36.867 --> 25:39.500
THE END.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.967
>> THE OTHER DAY, HILLARY ASKED

25:41.967 --> 25:45.166
ME, DONALD, DO YOU LOVE RUSSIA?

25:45.166 --> 25:47.667
I ANSWERED YES, I DO.

25:47.667 --> 25:49.667
I LOVE RUSSIA.

25:49.667 --> 25:50.667
BUT YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE AGAINST

25:50.667 --> 26:06.066
ME.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.900
>> John: OH, MY GOD!

26:09.900 --> 26:10.433
THAT'S AS HAPPY

26:10.433 --> 26:15.000
AS I'VE EVER SEEN PUTIN.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.934
AT LEAST WE NOW WE KNOW WHAT

26:16.934 --> 26:18.000
TYPE OF HUMOR HE LIKES.

26:18.000 --> 26:18.633
HE LIKES THE KIND WHERE HE

26:18.633 --> 26:19.333
MEDDLES IN ANOTHER COUNTRY'S

26:19.333 --> 26:20.266
ELECTION, SUCCEEDS, HAS A JOKE

26:20.266 --> 26:21.033
ABOUT IT MADE TO HIS FACE IN

26:21.033 --> 26:21.667
PUBLIC, AND THEN REALIZES THAT

26:21.667 --> 26:22.300
IT ALL WORKED AND NO ONE CAN

26:22.300 --> 26:26.000
TOUCH HIM.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.700
THAT'S THE KIND OF HUMOR

26:27.700 --> 26:29.367
PUTIN LIKES.

26:29.367 --> 26:30.100
LOOK, I KNOW ALL THIS IS

26:30.100 --> 26:30.967
DEPRESSING.

26:30.967 --> 26:32.100
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE AMERICA'S

26:32.100 --> 26:33.767
REPUTATION OVERSEAS IS UNDER

26:33.767 --> 26:36.700
ATTACK FROM ITS OWN PRESIDENT,

26:36.700 --> 26:38.033
WHICH IS JUST RIDICULOUS.

26:38.033 --> 26:38.900
SOFT POWER IS AN ACT OF

26:38.900 --> 26:40.734
SALESMANSHIP.

26:40.734 --> 26:42.600
IT'S SELLING YOUR BRAND.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.133
IT'S THE ONE THING TRUMP'S

26:44.133 --> 26:46.433
SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD AT, AND HE'S

26:46.433 --> 26:47.600
FUCKING BLOWING IT.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.767
SO, AS AN IMMIGRANT WHO HAS

26:48.767 --> 26:49.934
FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THIS

26:49.934 --> 26:51.734
COUNTRY, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

26:51.734 --> 26:52.633
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO SPEAK TO THE

26:52.633 --> 26:53.400
REST OF THE WORLD IN AMERICA'S

26:53.400 --> 26:55.033
DEFENSE.

26:55.033 --> 26:56.700
BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT

26:56.700 --> 26:58.433
REFLECT AMERICA.

26:58.433 --> 27:03.400
I MEAN, TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,

27:03.400 --> 27:05.066
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,

27:05.066 --> 27:08.600
HE DOES REFLECT IT A BIT.

27:08.600 --> 27:09.767
BUT THE POINT IS, AMERICA IS NOT

27:09.767 --> 27:10.800
ONE THING.

27:10.800 --> 27:11.834
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MESS OF

27:11.834 --> 27:12.700
CONTRADICTIONS WHERE GOOD AND

27:12.700 --> 27:14.133
BAD ARE MIXED TOGETHER.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.667
ON ONE HAND, IT MAKES MOUNTAIN

27:16.667 --> 27:18.266
DEW, WHICH TASTES LIKE A

27:18.266 --> 27:19.066
HONEYDEW MELON WAS FUCKED

27:19.066 --> 27:21.834
BY A RADIOACTIVE CLOWN.

27:21.834 --> 27:23.000
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT ALSO MADE

27:23.000 --> 27:23.900
THIS AWESOME BED SHAPED LIKE

27:23.900 --> 27:26.100
THE BATMOBILE.

27:26.100 --> 27:27.533
YOU CAN FALL ASLEEP IN THAT

27:27.533 --> 27:29.967
THING AND BE BATMAN!

27:29.967 --> 27:31.467
IF BATMAN SOMEHOW GOT LOCKED OUT

27:31.467 --> 27:32.133
OF THE BATCAVE AND HAD TO SLEEP

27:32.133 --> 27:34.033
IN HIS CAR.

27:34.033 --> 27:36.367
BUT THAT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM!

27:36.367 --> 27:37.667
AMERICA'S THE COUNTRY THAT CAME

27:37.667 --> 27:41.133
UP WITH YOUTUBE, WHICH, YES,

27:41.133 --> 27:42.500
I KNOW GAVE YOU THAT SHITHEAD

27:42.500 --> 27:44.233
LOGAN PAUL, BUT IT ALSO GAVE YOU

27:44.233 --> 27:46.000
THOSE VIDEOS OF ADULTS IN T-REX

27:46.000 --> 27:47.567
SUITS ON DIRT BIKES,

27:47.567 --> 27:51.100
BALLET-DANCING, EXERCISING,

27:51.100 --> 27:53.934
AND DOING BASIC CAR REPAIRS.

27:53.934 --> 27:54.934
AND BY THE WAY, THAT MAGNIFICENT

27:54.934 --> 27:56.100
DINOSAUR COSTUME?

27:56.100 --> 28:04.033
THAT'S AN AMERICAN IDEA TOO.

28:04.033 --> 28:05.734
AMERICA IS THE COUNTRY THAT GAVE

28:05.734 --> 28:06.233
YOU "STAR WARS."

28:06.233 --> 28:06.900
YOU'RE WELCOME.

28:06.900 --> 28:07.767
AND SCIENTOLOGY.

28:07.767 --> 28:08.700
WE'RE SORRY.

28:08.700 --> 28:10.333
AND SOMETIMES, WHAT'S GREAT AND

28:10.333 --> 28:11.066
TERRIBLE ABOUT US ARE IMPOSSIBLE

28:11.066 --> 28:11.934
TO SEPARATE.

28:11.934 --> 28:13.934
LIKE POPEYE'S CHICKEN.

28:13.934 --> 28:16.400
IT'S OBJECTIVELY DISGUSTING,

28:16.400 --> 28:19.166
BUT I WOULD RUN ACROSS TRAFFIC

28:19.166 --> 28:20.400
TO EAT THIS SHIT.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.700
THE POINT IS, TRUMP IS THE WORST

28:22.700 --> 28:24.500
OF US, BUT HE IS NOT ALL OF US.

28:24.500 --> 28:26.266
IF I HAD TO DISTILL AMERICA DOWN

28:26.266 --> 28:27.533
TO ONE SOUND, IT WOULDN'T BE THE

28:27.533 --> 28:29.200
BRAYING VOICE OF DONALD TRUMP

28:29.200 --> 28:31.467
SCREAMING "AMERICA FIRST."

28:31.467 --> 28:33.900
IT WOULD BE THE GORGEOUS VOICES

28:33.900 --> 28:36.467
OF THE NEW YORK CITY GAY MEN'S

28:36.467 --> 28:40.734
CHORUS SINGING THIS SONG.

28:40.734 --> 28:42.967
>> ♪ SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME

28:42.967 --> 28:50.367
♪ THE WORLD IS GONNA ROLL ME ♪

28:50.367 --> 28:51.333
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

28:51.333 --> 28:52.300
THAT'S "ALL STAR" BY SMASHMOUTH,

28:52.300 --> 28:53.033
A TERRIBLE, STUPID SONG BEING

28:53.033 --> 28:53.867
SUNG ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFULLY.

28:53.867 --> 28:55.333
