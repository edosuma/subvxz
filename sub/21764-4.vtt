00:54.095 --> 00:57.432
<i>I remember what it felt like</i>

00:57.515 --> 01:00.560
<i>We'd just solved over 300 mysteries.</i>

01:00.643 --> 01:03.354
<i>We were on top! Tippy top!</i>

01:03.438 --> 01:05.231
<i>Of our mystery solving game.</i>

01:05.315 --> 01:08.651
<i>Seemed like we would go on</i>
<i>solving mysteries forever,</i>

01:08.735 --> 01:09.861
<i>or so I thought,</i>

01:09.944 --> 01:13.406
<i>until that fateful day</i>
<i>we solved our last.</i>

01:15.492 --> 01:18.036
Now, remember, Mort,
you're delicious pie bait

01:18.119 --> 01:19.704
to catch the Phantom Ninja Pie Thief.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.791
I'm delicious pie bait!

01:22.874 --> 01:25.293
All right, KJ Mystery Solving 5!

01:25.376 --> 01:28.546
Let's catch this mysterious pie ninja!

01:30.423 --> 01:31.966
I love you too, Keytar.

01:32.050 --> 01:35.261
You are the most important member
of our mystery-solving group.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.056
Yes, you are. Don't argue with me.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.021
Hu-rah!

01:45.104 --> 01:47.482
Uh, nothing to see here.

01:47.565 --> 01:50.735
Just your average,
uh, Phantom Ninja Pie Thief!

01:50.819 --> 01:52.362
Uh, hu-rah!

01:52.445 --> 01:54.197
-Aw, sheesh!

01:54.280 --> 01:55.740
The pie's alive!

01:55.824 --> 01:56.783
Ha!

01:56.866 --> 01:58.952
You've been nabbed, pie ninja!

01:59.035 --> 02:00.870
You won't take me alive!

02:00.954 --> 02:03.581
Not you or your meddling pie!

02:03.665 --> 02:04.666
-Die!

02:08.169 --> 02:10.130
-Ah, sheesh!

02:10.213 --> 02:12.715
No! Keytar!

02:15.009 --> 02:16.970
<i>The pie went over the cliff</i>

02:17.053 --> 02:19.514
<i>and with it, my beloved Keytar...</i>

02:19.597 --> 02:20.849
<i>Oh, and Mort.</i>

02:20.932 --> 02:24.269
<i>The KJ Mystery Solving 5 was done.</i>

02:24.352 --> 02:27.522
<i>The surviving three members</i>
<i>went our separate ways.</i>

02:27.605 --> 02:28.439
Hu-rah!

02:28.523 --> 02:32.569
<i>And even though</i>
<i>it was a long time ago,</i>

02:32.652 --> 02:35.697
<i>those emotions...</i>

02:35.780 --> 02:38.992
<i>still run pretty deep.</i>

02:39.075 --> 02:42.912
Keytar, how I miss you.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.789
Oh, and you other guys, too.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.708
Emotions! Ugh!

02:48.001 --> 02:49.752
Don't like 'em.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.796
<i>Emotions were never my thing.</i>

02:51.880 --> 02:54.173
<i>What are they good for anyway?</i>

02:54.257 --> 02:55.967
<i>Just then, I heard something.</i>

02:56.050 --> 02:59.971
<i>Something that would change everything!</i>

03:00.054 --> 03:02.098
King Julien!

03:02.181 --> 03:03.641
<i>It was a dame</i>

03:03.725 --> 03:05.101
<i>but not just any dame.</i>

03:05.184 --> 03:07.103
<i>A dame with hands</i>
<i>like a pair of hunchbacks</i>

03:07.186 --> 03:09.022
<i>wrestling under a sweater.</i>

03:09.105 --> 03:12.775
-I need the Mystery Solving 5!

03:12.859 --> 03:15.653
Sorry, Tammy.
The mystery-solving gang broke up.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.113
Just me now.

03:17.196 --> 03:19.365
What

03:19.449 --> 03:22.619
Well, it's a long story.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.704
<i>Looking back on the glory days</i>

03:24.787 --> 03:28.416
<i>of the KJ Mystery Solving 5</i>
<i>all those years ago...</i>

03:28.499 --> 03:29.626
-King Julien!

03:29.709 --> 03:32.086
-I remember what it felt like!
-I got a real problem.

03:32.170 --> 03:35.381
Butterfish has gone missing,
and I am worried sick.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.884
Poor Todd is beside himself.

03:37.967 --> 03:40.845
He can't eat. He can't sleep.

03:40.929 --> 03:44.474
Look at him. Look at him!

03:44.557 --> 03:47.769
<i> Something</i>
<i>in the kid's soulless, dead-shark eyes</i>

03:47.852 --> 03:49.437
<i>-freaked me out so much...</i>

03:49.520 --> 03:52.148
<i>...I was afraid to turn the case down.</i>

03:52.232 --> 03:55.568
I'll do it,
but I got to ask you a few questions.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.737
What is a Butterfish?

03:57.820 --> 04:00.323
-Just find him!

04:00.406 --> 04:02.075
<i>Finding a missing</i>

04:02.158 --> 04:04.077
<i>Butterfish wasn't a dream case,</i>

04:04.160 --> 04:07.622
<i>but I decided</i>
<i>to burn a little shoe leather.</i>

04:07.705 --> 04:09.332
<i>First thing I noticed,</i>

04:09.415 --> 04:11.125
<i>everything was the wrong color.</i>

04:11.209 --> 04:13.544
<i>My booty didn't look good</i>
<i>in black and white.</i>

04:19.217 --> 04:21.844
<i>Hmm, that's better.</i>

04:21.928 --> 04:25.265
<i>Second, I knew Glitterbunz</i>
<i>was working the Brundle Man bar mitzvah.</i>

04:25.348 --> 04:28.268
<i>Good place to start asking around.</i>

Big man About yay wide?

04:51.708 --> 04:54.877
Uh, are you Koo

04:54.961 --> 04:58.131
Butterfish is the best doorman
in the business.

04:58.214 --> 05:01.175
He called in sick today,
and just look at this place.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.970
It's full of little...

05:04.053 --> 05:04.887
...kids!

05:04.971 --> 05:06.556
It's a bar mitzvah.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.350
You know, coming-of-age party
for preteen Jewish boys?

05:09.434 --> 05:12.395
Ah

05:12.478 --> 05:16.649
I just thought they were
some kind of stunted turtles or something.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.819
<i>It was a bust.</i>

05:19.902 --> 05:21.821
<i>Nobody had seen the big man.</i>

05:21.904 --> 05:24.782
<i>Just then, I got tossed a lucky break.</i>

05:24.866 --> 05:26.326
-Aah!

05:26.409 --> 05:29.120
<i>Almost got run over</i>
<i>by a bunch of bar mitzvah kids</i>

05:29.203 --> 05:31.456
<i>joyriding in their dad's wagon.</i>

05:31.539 --> 05:32.957
<i>That's when I found him...</i>

05:33.041 --> 05:34.208
<i>Butterfish.</i>

05:34.292 --> 05:36.252
-Aah!
<i> <i>He wasn't moving.</i></i>

05:36.335 --> 05:40.965
<i>Looked like he might have bought that old</i>
<i>one-way bus ticket to Frankri-la.</i>

05:41.049 --> 05:44.469
<i>Still, I needed to know for sure.</i>

05:53.227 --> 05:55.438
-No! Get away!

05:55.521 --> 05:58.274
Aw, man, something ain't right, King J.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.902
They after us! Ain't gonna get me!

06:00.985 --> 06:02.528
Get away!

06:02.612 --> 06:05.114
Ahh...

06:05.198 --> 06:07.742
<i>Another case closed.</i>

06:07.825 --> 06:10.870
<i>Time to tell Tammy the good news.</i>

06:14.248 --> 06:16.834
Oh, hello, King Julien.

06:16.918 --> 06:20.922
-How ever so nice to see you.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.882
Tammy, I found Butterfish.

06:22.965 --> 06:26.636
He's running around, ranting and raving,
like a lunatic in the jungle.

06:26.719 --> 06:30.515
Oh! Butterfish has been here
the whole time,

06:30.598 --> 06:33.226
playing a game with Todd.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.813
Todd, come say hello.

06:36.896 --> 06:37.980
Hello, sir.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.566
Get me out of here.

06:40.650 --> 06:41.943
Everything is fine here.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.654
Please take me with you.

06:44.737 --> 06:45.988
Todd!

06:46.072 --> 06:49.700
Little man, come on back
and finish the game.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.662
<i>This didn't make a lot of sense.</i>

06:52.745 --> 06:55.414
<i>How is it that Butterfish is here?</i>

06:55.498 --> 06:58.835
Anything else I can do for you,
King Julien?

06:58.918 --> 07:01.087
So nice to see you.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.381
Come by anytime.

07:04.715 --> 07:05.550
Huh?

07:05.633 --> 07:06.717
<i>Tammy acting sweet?</i>

07:06.801 --> 07:08.678
<i>Butterfish knowing Todd's name</i>

07:08.761 --> 07:10.763
<i>and the fact that Todd</i>
<i>wasn't a little girl?</i>

07:10.847 --> 07:13.891
<i>I mean, come on, man.</i>
<i>He knew Todd was a boy.</i>

07:13.975 --> 07:16.060
<i>Something was not right.</i>

07:16.144 --> 07:18.521
<i>Something was very off.</i>

07:19.856 --> 07:22.275
-Don't look at me, Julie.

07:22.358 --> 07:23.651
I said, don't look at me.

07:27.321 --> 07:30.366
You can look at me now. Look at me!

07:30.450 --> 07:32.368
Don't I look great?

07:32.452 --> 07:35.371
-Yeah, buddy, you look...
-Shh!

07:35.455 --> 07:37.832
Keep it down, Julie. Sheesh.

07:37.915 --> 07:40.418
-They could be watching.

07:40.501 --> 07:42.420
Exactly. Take this.

07:42.503 --> 07:46.007
Rob, I don't want
any of your face-lift leftovers.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.968
Oh, no, Julie,
I keep those in a jar at home.

07:49.051 --> 07:50.761
This is something I stumbled on.

07:50.845 --> 07:55.308
-It's the key to the whole thing.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.560
Exactly. Now you're getting it.

07:57.643 --> 08:00.229
-If they knew I had it, whoa, boy.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.689
You better hold on to it,

08:01.772 --> 08:04.358
in case something bad happens
to the old Rob-a-roono.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.987
Don't be silly, Rob.
What bad thing could possibly happen?

08:08.070 --> 08:09.739
Hey-ya, Rob!

08:09.822 --> 08:12.325
-The phone's for you.
-Thanks, Jimmy.

08:12.408 --> 08:14.702
Hello

08:14.785 --> 08:20.124
Oh, shellac my bones and call me Ginger!
They found me!

08:20.208 --> 08:21.501
Oh!

08:21.584 --> 08:22.835
Ohh!

08:28.257 --> 08:31.385
They got Rob!

08:31.469 --> 08:33.846
Okay, get it together, Julien.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.432
Who's to say what you saw

08:36.516 --> 08:41.229
Go to your happy place.
You can do this. Happy place.

08:41.312 --> 08:44.106
<i>All those horrible things</i>
<i>that happened to Rob</i>

08:44.190 --> 08:47.151
<i>could have been accidents, right?</i>

08:47.235 --> 08:49.570
<i>He was always accident-prone.</i>

08:49.654 --> 08:53.282
<i>Yeah, accidents.</i>

08:53.366 --> 08:55.243
<i>I thought a little stroll</i>
<i>amongst my peeps</i> <i>might put me in a better mood.</i>

08:57.286 --> 08:59.121
<i>Boy, was I wrong 'cause I saw...</i>

08:59.205 --> 09:00.540
Ah! Rob!

09:00.623 --> 09:01.874
Hiya, Julie.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.961
But I watched you get exploded!

09:05.044 --> 09:07.296
I don't know what you're talking about,
old chum.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.006
-But--

09:09.090 --> 09:12.260
Nothing like that happened to me.
I was never there.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.719
You gave me this.

09:14.804 --> 09:15.972
Ha ha, ha!

09:16.055 --> 09:18.766
I think you should
hand that over to me, Julie.

09:18.849 --> 09:19.684
You might get hurt.

09:19.767 --> 09:23.854
Better do as Rob says, King Julien.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.023
That is right, King J.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.484
Hand that over, and nobody gets hurt.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.695
Hand it over, ding-dong.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.114
Make it go easy on yourself, man.

09:34.907 --> 09:39.078
-B-b-b-b-beverage!

09:39.161 --> 09:42.373
King Julien. King Julien.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.709
King Julien. King Julien.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.169
King Julien. King Julien.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.755
<i>I had a real mystery</i>
<i>on my hands now.</i>

09:49.839 --> 09:52.592
I needed all the help I could get.

09:52.675 --> 09:56.762
Time to put the mystery-solving team
back together!

09:56.846 --> 09:58.264
I want it.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.807
-I am sorry, Princess.
-But I want it.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.517
-But I made this hat myself.
-I want that hat!

10:01.601 --> 10:04.103
Do you know how many hours
it took to stitch on

10:04.186 --> 10:06.689
each individual piece of glitter
with these claws?

10:06.772 --> 10:08.357
Simply ages.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.901
I don't care! I want it!

10:10.985 --> 10:13.112
-Yes, Princess!

10:13.195 --> 10:15.948
Sorry! What Amy wants, Amy gets!

10:16.032 --> 10:17.658
Be brave, be brave...

10:17.742 --> 10:19.952
Oh, okay, take it. Just take it.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.289
Clover, I know Mort dying and all

10:23.372 --> 10:26.334
was pretty traumatic,
but the kingdom needs you.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.918
I need you.

10:28.002 --> 10:31.255
We need the KJ Mystery Solving 5.

10:31.339 --> 10:35.343
Oh, thank Frank.
I've missed that life so much!

10:35.426 --> 10:36.886
I'm coming with you, King Julien.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.889
Well, let's go, then!

10:39.972 --> 10:42.642
Ugh. Rude.

10:42.725 --> 10:47.271
<i>Now that I had Clover,</i>
<i>we needed to find Maurice.</i>

11:22.890 --> 11:24.975
Ugh!

11:25.059 --> 11:28.437
Show us your musk gland!

11:28.521 --> 11:31.649
Excuse me, ladies.
Royal personage coming through.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.610
Stop the music! Stop it!

11:36.987 --> 11:40.074
Maurice, I don't know how to
tell you this, but your show is canceled.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.243
-I need you to help solve the mystery

11:42.326 --> 11:44.537
that's happening right now
in the Lemur Kingdom.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.998
I'm not coming back, Your Majesty,
and I'm not Maurice. I go by my natural-born
aye-aye name now--Bricky.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.963
And this is my place. Bricardo's.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.840
Bought it off my sister, Brosalind.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.967
First, that name is just stupid.

11:58.050 --> 12:01.595
Second, your name isn't Bricky.
It's Maurice.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.181
Say it. Maurice!

12:04.265 --> 12:05.975
-Bricky.
-No, it's with a M.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.436
It's like Mauuuu-reee...

12:08.519 --> 12:10.104
-Bricky!
-You are Maurice!

12:10.187 --> 12:12.022
-Bricky!
-Mo-Mo-Mo-Mo-Mo-Mo-Mo...

12:12.106 --> 12:13.482
-Maurice-reese-reese-reese!
-Bricky, Bricky, Bricky!

12:15.401 --> 12:17.278
-It's Mo-Mo!
-I said Bricky!

12:17.361 --> 12:18.946
Fine! That's how it is?

12:19.029 --> 12:21.031
You think these ladies love you?

12:21.115 --> 12:24.702
Ha! Or they just love you for your booty.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.371
Like an object. You are being objectified.

12:27.455 --> 12:31.000
But if they see a better booty,
they will leave you.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.170
Booty love is a fickle love, Mo-Mo!

12:34.253 --> 12:36.922
Fi-i-i-i-ckle!

12:37.006 --> 12:40.926
Nothing doing, Your Majesty.
I am never leaving here!

12:41.010 --> 12:43.512
Not as long as this place
is still standing.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.562
Great.

12:51.645 --> 12:56.025
Now that the gang is back together,
we can start with this clue.

12:56.108 --> 13:00.362
Well, I have to say,
this is not a mystery at all.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.489
It is nothing.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.324
I wish I could help you out, King Julien.

13:03.407 --> 13:06.243
But I cannot.
I will just hold on to this, though.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.038
-Hold on there, egghead.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.624
That chip is our only clue
to this mystery.

13:11.707 --> 13:14.752
Must not touch. Must not touch.

13:14.835 --> 13:18.422
-Must destroy. Must destroy.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.798
His creepy eyes!

13:19.882 --> 13:20.966
No!

13:31.852 --> 13:34.688
What in the Vicar's closet is...
Timo was a robot?

13:34.772 --> 13:37.233
Which would explain why all the people
attacked King Julien.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.692
They're all robots!

13:38.776 --> 13:40.236
But he exploded!

13:40.319 --> 13:42.446
It seems that heightened states of emotion

13:42.530 --> 13:45.032
are the key to destroying these robots.

13:45.115 --> 13:48.744
<i>Emotions. It had to be emotions.</i>

13:48.827 --> 13:50.913
<i>We needed to test Clover's theory.</i>

13:50.996 --> 13:54.250
<i>And I knew exactly the lemur-bot</i>
<i>for the job.</i>

13:54.333 --> 13:56.377
Must find King Julien.

13:56.460 --> 14:00.548
Get your face-lifts!
Uh, get your robot face-lifts right here!

14:00.631 --> 14:03.801
That's right.
Robot face-lifts are free today.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.970
I say, I say, step right up, sir.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.680
Oh, you look amazing, but, uh,

14:07.763 --> 14:10.307
you can always look more amazing,
am I right?

14:10.391 --> 14:12.309
Am I right? You know I'm right.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.979
I like face-lifts. I like face-lifts.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.939
Well, good for you.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.691
-The doctor will see you now.
-I like face-lifts.

14:20.192 --> 14:23.320
The booty is in the toilet.
Repeat. Booty in the toilet!

14:25.614 --> 14:27.867
Now, let's test out this emotion theory.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.327
Enough emotion should make Rob explode.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.912
All right.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.540
Eat this, Rob-bot.

14:34.623 --> 14:37.960
My name is Clover!
I hail from Dover!

14:38.043 --> 14:39.628
-I kick you flankers--
-Hmm...

14:39.712 --> 14:43.215
Eh-eh-eh, uh,
not so sure anger is working.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.885
-I got a better idea. Watch this.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.387
Maurice, I want you to look at something
very closely.

14:48.470 --> 14:49.471
Nuh-uh.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.141
Look at the kitten, Maurice.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.767
-I don't wanna.
-It's very simple.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.477
-You just look at it.
-Nuh-uh.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.438
-You know, just take a glance.
-I don't wanna.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.107
-So cute. You have to see it, really.
-I don't wanna.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.317
Look at it!

15:01.400 --> 15:03.944
-So...
-Look at it!

15:04.028 --> 15:06.155
-...cute!
-Look at it.

15:06.238 --> 15:09.950
Oh, its little furry head
and those big eyes.

Wait. Do you smell that

15:45.778 --> 15:48.906
-Uh, it is an outhouse, Clover.
-No, it's coffee.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.659
Poo-coffee!

15:51.742 --> 15:55.162
There's only one person
that could smell like poo-coffee.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.312
Hanging out with my aye-aye relations

16:20.396 --> 16:23.148
really got the old musk gland
working, you know?

16:23.232 --> 16:26.944
Well, keep it to yourself, buddy.
I mean, seriously.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.988
Quiet. Something's not right.

16:31.532 --> 16:35.494
No, Clover. Everything is right.

16:35.577 --> 16:36.829
Right as rain!

16:36.912 --> 16:39.039
Wouldn't you agree, Chauncey?

16:40.582 --> 16:44.003
All right, Karl,
what have you done with my peoples?

16:44.086 --> 16:46.380
Isn't it obvious, Julien?

16:46.463 --> 16:49.717
I've replaced them all with robots.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.762
King Julien! King Julien!

16:56.473 --> 16:57.558
You see, Julien,

16:57.641 --> 16:59.685
I learned a little something
from the whole endeavor

16:59.768 --> 17:02.938
of me helping you
rescue your kingdom from Koto.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.442
The one thing you care about
more than your kingdom

17:06.525 --> 17:09.570
is your people in it. And thus, in my most genius
and diabolical move,

17:12.781 --> 17:15.576
I have struck at the very heart of you

17:15.659 --> 17:19.163
by kidnapping all your peoples

17:19.246 --> 17:20.664
and locking them up!

17:24.877 --> 17:30.674
Look, I have robot replacements
for Maurice and Clover as well.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.468
That's horrible.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.012
This is the end!

17:35.095 --> 17:37.639
I want you to witness the horror

17:37.723 --> 17:40.726
of seeing your own people destroy you!

17:40.809 --> 17:45.230
-With their blank, lifeless, robotic eyes!

17:45.314 --> 17:48.650
I am not going down without a fight!

17:51.612 --> 17:53.030
-Aah!

18:04.583 --> 18:06.001
Ow!

18:12.716 --> 18:14.510
Huh

18:16.345 --> 18:19.807
-Ah...

18:22.101 --> 18:24.937
Aah!

18:25.562 --> 18:27.940
It's so beautiful, Chauncey!

18:28.023 --> 18:30.943
My masterpiece!

18:31.026 --> 18:32.569
Robot Butterfish,

18:32.653 --> 18:34.571
please finish this!

18:34.655 --> 18:38.033
Got to go to work. Got to go to work.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.661

18:46.917 --> 18:50.254

18:50.337 --> 18:52.172
Here, look at this!

18:52.256 --> 18:53.549
Huh?

18:53.632 --> 18:56.927
No cute cat pictures.
No cute cat pictures.

18:57.010 --> 18:59.263
Oh, quick, Mo-Mo, look!

19:07.938 --> 19:10.899
Mm-hmm. That's the last one.

19:10.983 --> 19:14.403
<i>There was absolutely no hope for us now.</i>

19:14.486 --> 19:16.113

19:20.033 --> 19:21.535
I'm sorry I'm late.

19:21.618 --> 19:24.288
Keytar and I were
stuck in that pie for years.

19:24.371 --> 19:27.583
Keytar! You're alive! Yes!

19:27.666 --> 19:29.877
Oh, and, Mort, you little tree worm!

19:29.960 --> 19:31.211
Ha ha! You're not dead either.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.921

Oh, it's really, really hot!

19:37.759 --> 19:40.053

21:34.876 --> 21:36.920
Yes, uh, Julien, in hindsight,

21:37.004 --> 21:39.006
I really shouldn't have bought those

21:39.089 --> 21:41.133
secondhand emotional regulator chips.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.885
You would think
I would have learned my lesson!

21:47.472 --> 21:49.850
You may have foiled my plan

21:49.933 --> 21:53.353
with all your singing and squirty tears,

21:53.437 --> 21:57.190
but, of course, this isn't over!

21:57.274 --> 22:00.068
Not yet at least!

22:00.152 --> 22:04.740

out of bed this morning.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.700
I was, like, totally exhausted.

22:06.783 --> 22:09.119
But--but I did learn a valuable lesson.

22:09.202 --> 22:11.663
Emotions are important.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.290
You shouldn't just ignore them.

22:13.373 --> 22:16.752
I finally understand
what they're good for.

22:16.835 --> 22:20.297
Emotions blow up robots! They do!

22:20.380 --> 22:23.550
Um, none of that actually happened,
Your Majesty.

22:23.633 --> 22:26.219
No, Clo-Clo, but it could have.

22:26.303 --> 22:27.929
It could have.

22:28.013 --> 22:31.349
That was a very silly story, Your Majesty.
