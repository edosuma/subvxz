and 6:00 A.M. tomorrow?

08:20.320 --> 08:22.443
- That's not fair.
- Management don't care.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.050
Party tonight is off.

08:24.119 --> 08:26.386
Nothing is off. A-Dogg is on it.

08:26.488 --> 08:28.900
- "A-Dogg"?
- Let me have this.

08:29.387 --> 08:31.503
So, you put a little
bit of the cream on top.

08:31.528 --> 08:33.121
- Uh-huh.
- And then...

08:33.224 --> 08:34.690
Got it. Mmm.

08:34.726 --> 08:37.124
Terrific birthday
surprise. Sorry it's over.

08:37.149 --> 08:38.248
It's just starting.

08:38.357 --> 08:40.357
I have a lot of surprises coming.

08:40.434 --> 08:41.734
Joshua: [Sing-song voice]
Knockedy-knock-knock.

08:41.828 --> 08:43.400
- Okay, what do I do?
- What did you do?

08:43.426 --> 08:44.629
It's a massage!

08:44.698 --> 08:46.397
Let them in, young man.

08:46.422 --> 08:48.723
It's Ben. We've met 30 times.

08:48.748 --> 08:50.258
Oh, Gloria.

08:50.326 --> 08:51.492
Friend.

08:51.517 --> 08:53.713
Listen, while I appreciate
the idea of a massage...

08:53.738 --> 08:55.696
- You hate it.
- Well...

08:55.765 --> 08:58.316
You always hate my gifts.
I don't even know why I try.

08:58.341 --> 09:00.074
No, no, please, uh, let me finish.

09:00.177 --> 09:02.660
I've always appreciated the thought

09:02.685 --> 09:04.012
of a massage in my office,

09:04.037 --> 09:05.674
and now it's actually happening.

09:05.699 --> 09:07.065
- Ah! [Laughs]
- Thank you.

09:07.090 --> 09:08.275
Which one of you lovelies is Claire?

09:08.300 --> 09:09.801
- She is!
- Oh, great.

09:09.903 --> 09:11.069
Just give me the quick version, okay?

09:11.104 --> 09:12.904
- 90 minutes. You got it, hon.
- Okay.

09:12.940 --> 09:15.435
My department is asking if
there's still gonna be coffee

09:15.460 --> 09:16.793
or if they have to start bringing it.

09:16.863 --> 09:18.062
Who... who's this?

09:18.087 --> 09:20.921
Uh, he's interviewing for
a job in the warehouse.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.833
He's a, um, forklift operator.

09:22.936 --> 09:24.265
That's right. It's 2017.

09:24.290 --> 09:27.019
There are plenty of
gay forklift drivers.

09:27.044 --> 09:28.544
I'm not gay.

09:28.569 --> 09:29.712
It's cool, bro. I'm woke.

09:29.798 --> 09:31.785
- It's cool, bro. I'm woke.
- [Laughs]

09:31.810 --> 09:33.039
That's funny!

09:33.117 --> 09:35.851
You sound just like that guy over there.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.057
- That guy?
- Okay, it's back-to-work time.

09:38.082 --> 09:39.602
- We got to take a look at these.
- Yeah.

09:39.643 --> 09:41.609
See ya later. We'll catch up.

09:41.809 --> 09:43.253
Okay, this is crazy.

09:43.355 --> 09:45.889
I don't need an MRI.

09:45.956 --> 09:48.156
The doctor ordered when you
told her you could taste colors

09:48.259 --> 09:50.058
- in a French accent.
- Oh... all right.

09:50.127 --> 09:51.581
Well, I don't even do a French accent.

09:51.606 --> 09:52.772
I didn't say it was a good one.

09:52.797 --> 09:54.964
Guys, we usually try to
move the head injuries along.

09:55.078 --> 09:57.572
- Yes.
- Okay. Well, it's...

09:58.052 --> 09:59.453
it's just so small.

09:59.522 --> 10:00.821
It's bigger than it looks.

10:00.890 --> 10:02.089
See, there's nothing
wrong with my brain,

10:02.158 --> 10:03.652
'cause I have three
funny comebacks to that.

10:03.677 --> 10:05.454
Cam, come on, let's
listen to, uh, Bobby.

10:05.503 --> 10:06.902
He knows what he's talking about.

10:07.004 --> 10:09.004
I don't think we can really trust

10:09.073 --> 10:11.039
anything a grown man named Bobby says.

10:11.064 --> 10:12.558
Come on, honey, you got this.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.845
Okay. Uh, Robert, hi.

10:15.128 --> 10:16.780
Can I have... question. So, listen.

10:16.805 --> 10:18.438
I know this is a giant magnet,

10:18.540 --> 10:20.140
and I have a lot of fillings.

10:20.208 --> 10:21.808
Are they just gonna fly out of my head?

10:21.843 --> 10:23.589
- That never happens.
- Okay.

10:23.614 --> 10:25.808
Um, I'm also on an iron supplement.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.700
- Is that...
- An issue? No.

10:27.787 --> 10:29.153
Let's just get you on that table, huh?

10:29.222 --> 10:30.688
- [Chuckles]
- Come on.

10:30.790 --> 10:32.137
Hm.

10:34.657 --> 10:36.012
[Exhales]

10:38.087 --> 10:39.353
No, okay, not happening.

10:39.438 --> 10:40.604
I'm having flashbacks.

10:40.672 --> 10:41.905
I don't know if I ever told you this,

10:41.974 --> 10:43.693
but when I was kid, I fell into a well.

10:43.718 --> 10:45.355
Together: It happened the
same day as baby Jessica,

10:45.380 --> 10:46.553
but she got all the press.

10:46.578 --> 10:48.832
It still stings. Everybody loves a baby,

10:48.857 --> 10:50.457
but not one single
prayer for a husky teen

10:50.492 --> 10:51.797
who's stuck head-first in a well

10:51.805 --> 10:52.950
for the better part of an hour.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.848
Okay, Cam, come on. You have
got to calm down, all right?

10:54.903 --> 10:56.369
It'll be over before you know it.

10:56.471 --> 10:58.147
- In an hour.
- I'm... I can't!

10:58.172 --> 10:59.842
- I'm done, I'm out!
- Okay, wait, wait, Cam, Cam.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.700
Okay, Bobby, is it
okay if I get in there

11:01.725 --> 11:03.238
to show Cam that it's all right?

11:03.263 --> 11:04.346
Do we have time for that?

11:04.371 --> 11:05.837
Sure, my 4:00 hemorrhaged.

11:05.939 --> 11:07.071
Can you not... okay.

11:07.388 --> 11:09.087
All right, look at this, Cam.

11:09.130 --> 11:10.956
- Just be careful.
- It's comfortable.

11:11.058 --> 11:12.952
- We've got you.
- Okay, I'm good.

11:12.977 --> 11:14.163
Okay.

11:15.282 --> 11:16.811
Ah.

11:17.444 --> 11:20.111
Actually, Cam, this is very peaceful.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.279
It was a torture chamber.

11:21.315 --> 11:23.277
I was in there one minute, and I cried.

11:23.644 --> 11:24.716
I feel so rested.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.860
I do, I do, I really do.

11:26.885 --> 11:28.497
Now you. It's all good.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.420
There you go. All right.

11:30.488 --> 11:32.622
And I will be right here beside you.

11:32.691 --> 11:34.290
Uh, no one's allowed in
here except the patient.

11:34.359 --> 11:36.982
I will be in the next
room right beside you.

11:37.007 --> 11:38.176
Okay, so put your headphones on.

11:38.201 --> 11:39.321
They're gonna play you something

11:39.345 --> 11:41.212
- to get your mind off of it.
- Yeah.

11:41.237 --> 11:42.389
- This is a panic button.
- Oh.

11:42.414 --> 11:44.610
- Just push it if you need to get out.
- Oh, okay.

11:44.641 --> 11:46.147
Well, I think I can do this.

11:46.186 --> 11:47.281
[Sighs]

11:47.306 --> 11:49.039
[MRI beeping]

11:50.891 --> 11:52.703
<i>"This American Life," I'm Ira Glass.</i>

11:52.728 --> 11:54.728
<i>Today's program... "Puppy Love."</i>

11:54.764 --> 11:55.999
<i>We'll hear the story of a man</i>

11:56.024 --> 11:58.472
<i>who met his soul mate
through a lost schnauzer,</i>

11:58.496 --> 12:01.731
<i>a beagle from Coos Bay, Oregon,
who, for one week, was mayor.</i>

12:01.841 --> 12:03.174
<i>And we start with Act 1,</i>

<i>a search-and-rescue collie
looking for his owner,</i>

12:05.496 --> 12:07.530

Woman: <i>After drinking

12:10.134 --> 12:13.447
<i>Horace Laughton could no longer
ignore the terrible truth...</i>

12:13.472 --> 12:14.704
<i>he was running out of oxygen.</i>

12:14.806 --> 12:16.622
H-help. Help!

12:16.647 --> 12:18.532
Help! Get me out of here!

12:18.557 --> 12:20.510
Hey! I will kill you!

12:21.377 --> 12:22.565
Ohh! (groans)

12:22.590 --> 12:24.657
Cam, come on, this is serious.

12:24.682 --> 12:25.837
[Panting]

12:25.862 --> 12:27.509
Oh, my God. I can't breathe.

12:27.534 --> 12:29.491
I need air. I need air!

12:29.526 --> 12:31.761
[Scoffs] I'm sorry. He
is being such a baby, huh?

12:31.786 --> 12:35.223
There's a camera in
there. I watched you cry.

12:35.990 --> 12:38.424
And finally, employees should
have a say in the shift schedule.

12:38.493 --> 12:40.192
It would allow us to
plan our lives accordingly

12:40.217 --> 12:41.937
and would result in fewer missed days.

12:41.962 --> 12:45.536
In summation, no caffeination
without representation.

12:46.136 --> 12:48.402
So, am I fired?

12:49.100 --> 12:50.589
Are you kidding me?

12:50.624 --> 12:53.224
Those are 20-ounce
ideas in a 16-ounce cup.

12:53.249 --> 12:54.293
[Scoffs]

12:54.361 --> 12:57.409
I have overlooked a rising star...

12:57.434 --> 12:59.705
right under my nose.

13:00.267 --> 13:03.168
- But that's the...
- Yes, the assistant manager's apron.

13:03.270 --> 13:04.815
I didn't come in here for that.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.237
That's exactly why you're getting it.

13:07.339 --> 13:09.806
- But I... I can't.
- Shh.

13:09.908 --> 13:11.809
Oh, my God, this is so confusing.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.944
- So, the little guy from "Elf"...
- Tyrion Lannister.

13:13.969 --> 13:15.322
Whatever. I don't know actors' names.

13:15.347 --> 13:17.347
Is he Jaime's brother
or Cersei's brother?

13:17.449 --> 13:19.516
Both... Jaime and Cersei
are brother and sister.

13:19.584 --> 13:20.750
But they were just
doing it in the tower.

13:20.852 --> 13:21.974
That is so twisted.

13:21.999 --> 13:23.777
[Gasps] Go on.

13:23.855 --> 13:25.300
Guys, the craziest thing just happened.

13:25.325 --> 13:26.558
I went in there with a list of demands.

13:26.660 --> 13:28.660
And weaseled your way to a promotion.

13:28.762 --> 13:31.121
No, trust me... n-nothing
is going to change.

13:31.146 --> 13:33.264
But while I'm staring at it,
would one of you guys mind

13:33.366 --> 13:34.743
taking out this trash at some point?

13:34.768 --> 13:36.468
Heil, assistant manager.

13:36.570 --> 13:38.470
No, no, no, no, no! This
is good for all of us.

13:38.572 --> 13:41.806
Now we have someone on the inside... me.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.200
- A-Dogg.
- More like Adolf.

13:44.765 --> 13:47.958
I-I-I think you're really
minimizing that atrocity.

13:51.570 --> 13:52.875
[Vehicle approaches]

13:52.900 --> 13:54.397
Now, let me do the talking.

13:54.422 --> 13:56.589
Good. I don't feel like talking.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.917
It's just you nurture
a dream for 30 years,

13:58.942 --> 14:01.576
only to see it go up in
flames like Pete's eyebrow.

14:01.601 --> 14:03.932
- I feel like a part of...
- This is you not talking?

14:03.957 --> 14:06.037
- There he is. Go.
- [Sighs]

14:06.954 --> 14:08.428
Oh, it's you.

14:08.453 --> 14:09.862
Now, before you say anything,

14:09.887 --> 14:11.233
we're still not interested.

14:11.258 --> 14:12.854
- Okay.
- But if we were interested,

14:12.923 --> 14:15.430
it would take a hell of a lot
more than what you offered.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.588
- What about all the sewage?
- You get used to it.

14:17.657 --> 14:18.723
Gentlemen, when I made that offer,

14:18.791 --> 14:20.024
we didn't know about
any of the problems.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.559
I'm afraid we're no longer interested.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.748
Jared, I like you.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.439
We're willing to go 5%.

14:26.507 --> 14:28.817
Like I said, the offer's off the table.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.490
- You guys need a ride?
- I have a car. Thank you.

14:31.755 --> 14:33.932
Hope it's not that one over there.

14:34.932 --> 14:37.600
Yo! My dog is in that car!

14:37.919 --> 14:39.652
Hey!

14:39.960 --> 14:42.855
And as Hodor blocked the door
to save his friend Bran Stark,

14:42.924 --> 14:45.257
Bran had a vision of
a younger Hodor saying,

14:45.326 --> 14:47.426
"Hold the door, hold the door.

14:47.528 --> 14:48.661
"Hold door."

14:48.730 --> 14:51.030
And finally, "Hodor,"
the only word he would say

14:51.055 --> 14:52.699
for the rest of his life,

14:52.724 --> 14:54.490
a life that was now ending.

14:54.559 --> 14:56.335
[Voice breaking] He knew.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.227
Hodor knew his whole life

14:58.263 --> 15:01.351
that his destiny was to
save his little friend.

15:01.376 --> 15:03.599
Just like you have saved from
embarrassment at Comic-Con,

15:03.668 --> 15:05.653
- so thank you, Manny.
- My pleasure.

15:05.678 --> 15:06.804
I should get going.

15:06.832 --> 15:09.199
Oh, my God, me too. I have to
change into my Khaleesi costume.

15:09.224 --> 15:12.124
I could probably stick
around for a few more minutes.

15:12.368 --> 15:13.956
Maybe I'll move the party to Monday.

15:13.991 --> 15:15.257
Oh! I'm free Monday.

15:15.283 --> 15:16.719
[Inhales] Let's talk later.

15:16.744 --> 15:18.805
No, please. I never meant to betray you.

15:18.830 --> 15:21.269
Your friendship means more
to me than this stupid apron.

15:21.294 --> 15:22.765
Stupid?

15:22.868 --> 15:24.300
Oh, Scott.

15:24.652 --> 15:26.219
There's a whole world of people

15:26.287 --> 15:27.386
that would kill to wear this apron,

15:27.422 --> 15:29.155
but this just isn't my path.

15:29.256 --> 15:32.252
This extra responsibility
has me feeling alienated.

15:32.277 --> 15:35.049
It's lonely one step down from the top.

15:35.080 --> 15:36.396
You may not believe this,

15:36.431 --> 15:39.350
but it's even lonelier way up here.

15:39.375 --> 15:42.860
Somewhere on my climb,
I forgot my own dream...

15:42.884 --> 15:45.559
to be the best damn speed-metal
drummer in the Inland Empire.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.081
- There's still time, Scott.
- You're right.

15:48.122 --> 15:49.597
- I quit.
- What?

15:49.666 --> 15:52.033
You are the manager now.

15:52.101 --> 15:54.904
Hey, you two, party
at my house. Come on!

15:54.929 --> 15:56.508
- Yeah.
- Okay.

15:58.471 --> 16:01.734
Oh, FYI, one of the
toilets is overflowing.

16:06.984 --> 16:08.384
Seriously, the roof?

16:08.702 --> 16:09.968
I've been looking for you everywhere.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.037
I just needed some
space and some fresh air.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.139
[Inhales] It smells so purple.

16:14.222 --> 16:15.889
Okay, you're going
in that tube. Come on.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.937
[Grav crunching]

16:18.413 --> 16:20.307
Seriously, that's as
hard as you can pull?

16:20.369 --> 16:21.887
I am not the weak one here.

16:21.912 --> 16:23.804
You're the one who won't even
get a simple medical test.

16:23.906 --> 16:25.839
What are you... scared?
Huh? You're chicken?

16:25.941 --> 16:28.539
Yeah, and I thought I made that
clear in there when I peed a little.

16:28.564 --> 16:30.563
Fine, you just go ahead and die.

16:30.588 --> 16:32.233
And I'll raise Lily by myself,

16:32.268 --> 16:35.302
and she will never step foot
in another farm or circus.

16:35.404 --> 16:36.637
I will haunt you.

16:36.706 --> 16:39.375
Or you could just get your head checked

16:39.400 --> 16:41.967
so we don't lose you
over some stupid fear.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.802
Do you know what I went
through in that well

16:43.904 --> 16:45.537
on October 14, 1987,

16:45.606 --> 16:46.905
while the whole world was focused

16:46.974 --> 16:48.475
on that media whore Jessica?

16:48.500 --> 16:50.853
- She was a baby, but yeah.
- It was hell.

16:50.878 --> 16:52.812
And I would not have survived

16:52.837 --> 16:54.737
if those firemen wouldn't
have figured out a way

16:54.806 --> 16:56.834
to lower my little
Aunt Edna into that we

16:56.859 --> 16:58.993
and touch my feet and tell
me it was gonna be okay

16:59.062 --> 17:00.228
and that I wasn't alone.

17:00.296 --> 17:02.396
Cam, if there's a way that
I could be in there with you,

17:02.421 --> 17:03.854
I would, but I...

17:04.000 --> 17:05.599
Wait a minute.

17:06.140 --> 17:07.272
Hey, you're doing great.

17:07.340 --> 17:09.101
Okay, I'm right there with you.

17:09.126 --> 17:10.809
You're not alone.

17:10.978 --> 17:12.944
[Gloves squeaking]

17:14.479 --> 17:15.811
Thank you.

17:15.914 --> 17:18.414
- You're a good husband.
- Oh, that's very sweet.

17:18.467 --> 17:20.089
- [Intercom beeps]
- Oh, and, Cam.

17:20.131 --> 17:22.464
If the scan shows that
you're fine, you can suck it,

17:22.490 --> 17:24.223
because this
mechanically-challenged daddy

17:24.277 --> 17:26.384
made this foot-rubbing
machine all by himself.

17:26.493 --> 17:28.493
I did. I did this.

17:30.643 --> 17:32.298
It's good, right?

17:32.323 --> 17:34.207
I see you unclenching.

17:34.232 --> 17:36.799
I'm just concerned that
other people are gonna see me.

17:36.854 --> 17:37.973
[Indistinct shouting]

17:37.998 --> 17:39.331
Keep still, please.

17:39.356 --> 17:42.222
Ben: I told you, she's
in a meeting right now.

17:42.247 --> 17:43.513
Let... let go of my tie.

17:43.548 --> 17:44.881
You're not getting any looser.

17:44.906 --> 17:45.938
Oh, I wonder why.

17:46.150 --> 17:47.216
Come on, get back to work.

17:47.241 --> 17:49.352
It's a little hard to focus
with the smell of truffles

17:49.387 --> 17:51.454
just wafting out of
your girlfriend's office.

17:51.479 --> 17:54.124
My girlfriend is your boss, okay?

17:54.149 --> 17:55.279
And she's not my girlfriend.

17:55.305 --> 17:56.772
I won't deny we have chemistry,

17:56.840 --> 17:59.335
a certain will-they,
won't-they kind of vibe.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.636
Okay, guys, hi.

18:00.723 --> 18:02.056
If you could just give me 20 minutes

18:02.125 --> 18:03.491
to deal with a personal situation,

18:03.559 --> 18:06.214
I promise I will come out and
address all of your concerns.

18:06.239 --> 18:07.588
- What is going on in there?
- Yeah.

18:07.613 --> 18:10.831
Well, um, it's a medical situation.

18:10.867 --> 18:13.182
Actually, and it's kind of embarrassing,

18:13.207 --> 18:17.638
so I appreciate your support
in this difficult time.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.426
[Boxes rustling]

18:19.495 --> 18:21.361
We got to wrap this up.
How long do you need?

18:21.464 --> 18:22.729
At least 15 minutes.

18:22.832 --> 18:24.031
You got five.

18:24.099 --> 18:25.566
Ma'am, this job is hard enough.

18:25.668 --> 18:27.814
[Moans]

18:27.839 --> 18:29.603
Uh, hey, so, small problem.

18:29.705 --> 18:31.102
Gloria: It can wait!

18:31.127 --> 18:32.913
Every problem can wait.

18:32.982 --> 18:34.786
So now go, mister.

18:34.811 --> 18:36.611
Come on, I've been in your home.

18:36.679 --> 18:38.304
All right, Ben. What is it?

18:38.330 --> 18:39.858
- Today's Margaret's birthday...
- Uh-huh.

18:39.883 --> 18:41.950
... but it was too
late to cancel the cake.

18:42.052 --> 18:43.218
Everyone saw it get delivered.

18:43.243 --> 18:44.830
It's fine. Let them eat cake.

18:44.855 --> 18:46.588
- What?
- Is she kidding?

18:46.613 --> 18:48.752
Claire: That's not what I meant!

18:48.777 --> 18:50.779
- Claire, breathe.
- No, no!

18:50.804 --> 18:52.003
Gloria, we're done.

18:52.072 --> 18:54.672
Don't scream at me. I just
wanted to make you happy.

18:54.741 --> 18:56.203
And I'm just trying to make <i> you</i> happy

18:56.228 --> 18:57.609
because you're so damn sensitive

18:57.677 --> 18:59.748
about me not liking
your birthday presents.

18:59.773 --> 19:02.608
Come on, this is the
last thing I needed today.

19:02.633 --> 19:04.599
[Boxes rustling]

19:04.778 --> 19:06.845
Oh, my God. Look at her hands.

19:07.172 --> 19:08.838
She's just been in
here getting a manicure.

19:08.901 --> 19:09.974
How do you sleep?

19:09.999 --> 19:11.832
- Get her!
- Whoa, whoa, back it up, Josie.

19:11.866 --> 19:13.086
Nobody's gonna get her.

19:13.118 --> 19:16.887
I realize that the optics are a
bit troubling, especially today.

19:16.982 --> 19:18.481
A day when you've been sipping champagne

19:18.550 --> 19:20.850
while we've gone over
an hour without snacks.

19:20.919 --> 19:22.173
Enough!

19:22.554 --> 19:24.309
You should all be ashamed of yourselves.

19:24.378 --> 19:25.978
How long have I known you people?

19:26.080 --> 19:28.213
Dom, Kenny, Josie,

19:28.315 --> 19:29.915
- the two Herms.
- Seriously?

19:29.984 --> 19:33.170
You all go home at 5:00.
This woman never punches out.

19:33.195 --> 19:35.095
She goes home and never sleeps

19:35.142 --> 19:37.876
because she's thinking how
to make this company better.

19:38.119 --> 19:41.220
Can't you tell what
a mess she has become?

19:41.289 --> 19:44.057
How tense she is, her awkward tics,

19:44.125 --> 19:47.627
the way she grinds her teeth to dust.

19:47.729 --> 19:50.194
I think that she
deserves some pampering.

19:50.219 --> 19:52.019
So now get out of here!

19:52.088 --> 19:53.487
Let's go. Come on.

19:53.589 --> 19:54.722
Gloria.

19:54.790 --> 19:55.789
I am sorry.

19:55.892 --> 19:57.992
I just wanted to make
it right this year.

19:58.094 --> 20:00.683
Oh, you did. You really did.

20:00.708 --> 20:02.608
Okay, good. So go back and sit down

20:02.633 --> 20:05.310
because hugging you is
like hugging a coat rack.

20:05.336 --> 20:07.258
Bah. Okay.

20:07.283 --> 20:09.638
Oh, that's good.

20:10.980 --> 20:12.446
I'm sorry.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.863
- I dreamt too big.
- It's not your fault.

20:14.888 --> 20:17.289
I'm the one who believed in you.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.932
You're also the one
who overplayed his hand.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.184
We've already established
mistakes were made.

20:22.209 --> 20:24.670
We need to be thinking about next steps.

20:24.772 --> 20:26.105
Maybe we need to build
something smaller,

20:26.207 --> 20:27.917
like a cool restaurant or something.

20:27.942 --> 20:30.051
I've thought about that.
Who's gonna come down here?

20:30.076 --> 20:32.239
There's nowhere to park.

20:32.379 --> 20:35.778
Oh, my God, that's it... a parking lot.

20:35.879 --> 20:37.717
That's not bad.

20:37.819 --> 20:38.884
We could build it for nothing

20:38.986 --> 20:41.028
and pay off the majority
of the loan by tomorrow.

20:41.053 --> 20:43.317
- [flame whooshes]
- Let's talk about this somewhere else.

20:43.991 --> 20:46.292
Maybe 15-year-old Phil had it right.

20:46.394 --> 20:47.760
Sometimes you have to look at your dream

20:47.785 --> 20:49.872
from a different angle.

20:50.998 --> 20:53.802
I guess it was a parking lot all along.

20:57.543 --> 20:58.659
[Timer dings]

20:58.684 --> 21:00.792
Please tell me that's
dinner. I'm starving.

21:00.817 --> 21:01.840
No, that's Daddy's alarm.

21:01.865 --> 21:03.398
We can't let him nap
for more than two hours

21:03.423 --> 21:05.176
because of the concussion.

21:05.207 --> 21:07.221
Oh, look at him. He looks so peaceful.

21:07.323 --> 21:08.971
He's had such a rough day.

21:08.996 --> 21:11.252
When I tried to wake him up
last time, he got so upset.

21:11.284 --> 21:14.002
- I'll do it.
- Who raised you?

21:14.027 --> 21:16.198
- Fine, just be gentle, okay?
- Thanks.

21:16.223 --> 21:17.635
Also, don't touch this.

21:17.660 --> 21:19.026
It's my art project.

21:19.051 --> 21:20.917
- Oh, can I help you with that?
- No.

21:20.942 --> 21:23.549
Daddy said he should because
he's more artistic than you.

21:23.574 --> 21:24.580
Okay.

21:25.389 --> 21:26.821
[Pan banging]

21:26.846 --> 21:28.619
What?! What?! Why?!

21:28.644 --> 21:30.911
Oh, good, you're alive.
