09:46.934 --> 09:49.900
VIVALDI'S
<i>FOUR SEASONS. </i>
<i>I LOVE THAT. </i>

09:49.900 --> 09:51.033
SO DO I.

09:51.033 --> 09:53.033
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
IF YOU CLOSE
YOUR EYES,

09:53.033 --> 09:56.500
YOU CAN
ACTUALLY SEE
THE SEASONS CHANGE.

09:56.500 --> 09:59.200
I SAID THAT. I SAID
THE EXACT SAME THING.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.734
YOU KNOW, I REALLY
LIKE HANGING OUT
WITH YOU.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.767
MAYBE WE
COULD SEE A MOVIE
LATER ON THIS WEEK.

10:03.767 --> 10:06.233
I HEAR THERE'S A NEW
VAN DAMME MOVIE OPENING.

10:06.233 --> 10:07.734
I LOVE VAN DAMME.

10:07.734 --> 10:09.133
I KNOW.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.600
SO, HOW ABOUT
FRIDAY NIGHT?

10:11.600 --> 10:14.467
OH, I HAVE PLANS
WITH TED THAT NIGHT.

10:14.467 --> 10:17.300
YOU'RE STILL
GOING OUT WITH TED?

10:17.300 --> 10:20.033
YEAH.

10:22.133 --> 10:23.300
OH.

10:24.367 --> 10:25.867
I'M, UM--

10:25.867 --> 10:29.133
I'D BETTER GO CHECK
ON OUR FOOD.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.200
SHE'S STILL
GOING OUT WITH TED.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.033
YEAH, I KNOW.
HE'S A 2-WEEKER.

10:36.033 --> 10:39.400
HE MEANS NOTHING.
JUST A NAME IN HER BOOK.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.934
TELL HER
HOW YOU FEEL, OK?

10:40.934 --> 10:42.400
SPEAK FROM YOUR HEART.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.500
ARE YOU SURE?

10:44.500 --> 10:46.900
HEY, WHO'S FLYING
THE PLANE?

10:47.967 --> 10:49.967
CORY IS.

10:52.033 --> 10:53.467
WELL, HERE WE GO.

10:53.467 --> 10:54.900
GREAT.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.033
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

10:58.033 --> 11:01.000
YOU CAN ASK ME
ANYTHING.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.300
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF CORY AND TOPANGA?

11:04.300 --> 11:06.800
I THINK THEY'RE
A GREAT COUPLE.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.967
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE
WHAT THEY HAVE.

11:09.967 --> 11:13.200
SHAWN, WE'RE
NOT EVEN DATING.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.000
WHAT DO YOU CALL
WHAT WE'RE DOING
RIGHT NOW?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.600
YOU ASKED ME OUT
ON A DATE, RIGHT?

11:16.600 --> 11:19.300
I ASKED YOU TO GO
GET SOMETHING TO EAT.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.367
YOU GAVE ME A SEASHELL.

11:21.367 --> 11:25.767
SOMETIMES A SEASHELL
IS JUST A SEASHELL.

11:25.767 --> 11:29.934
LOOK, ANGELA,
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU

11:29.934 --> 11:33.400
MORE THAN ANYBODY
IN THIS ENTIRE WORLD.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.767
WHY CAN'T WE BE
CORY AND TOPANGA?

11:42.200 --> 11:45.567
I'M SORRY.
I GOT TO GO.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.400
STUPID! STUPID!

11:57.400 --> 11:58.400
STUPID! STUPID!
SHAWN!

11:58.400 --> 12:00.867
OH, CORY,
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT.

12:00.867 --> 12:05.834
CRASH AND BURN.
NUNS SHOULD NEVER
FLY AIRPLANES.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.567
I'M JUST GOING TO GO BACK
TO THE WAY THINGS WERE.

12:07.567 --> 12:08.567
NO, YOU DON'T, OK?

12:08.567 --> 12:09.567
YOU CAN'T GO BACK
TO THIS.

12:09.567 --> 12:11.934
THIS WILL NEVER
MAKE YOU HAPPY.

12:11.934 --> 12:15.000
AAH! MY AUNT!

12:15.000 --> 12:16.600
LOOK, I GAVE IT
A SHOT, OK?

12:16.600 --> 12:18.300
I OPENED MYSELF UP,
AND I GOT HURT.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.367
OBVIOUSLY ANGELA
DOESN'T WANT
WHAT I WANT.

12:20.367 --> 12:22.500
NO, SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE WANTS, OK?

12:22.500 --> 12:24.000
I KNOW
WHAT SHE WANTS.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.567
HERE, I WANT
TO TELL YOU A STORY.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.834
NOW, 13 YEARS AGO,
SHAWN,

12:29.834 --> 12:31.300
I WAS IN THE SANDBOX
WITH TOPANGA.

12:31.300 --> 12:35.100
AND THEN SHE STARTED
GOING AFTER
JOEY HUTCHINSON.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.367
I DON'T HAVE
TO TELL YOU HOW
THAT MADE ME FEEL.

12:37.367 --> 12:38.600
YOU WERE 4.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.600
WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE 5
TO HAVE FEELINGS.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.400
ANYWAY, I COULD HAVE
GIVEN UP, RIGHT?

12:43.400 --> 12:46.300
I MEAN, THE SANDBOX
WAS FILLED
WITH PRETTY BABIES,

12:46.300 --> 12:47.300
BUT I DIDN'T
GIVE UP.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.000
SO I TOLD JOEY
THAT HE COULD FLY,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.100
AND I POINTED
TO THE MONKEY BARS.

12:52.100 --> 12:54.967
AND FOR THAT BRIEF
MOMENT THAT JOEY
WAS AIRBORNE,

12:54.967 --> 12:59.000
I TOLD TOPANGA SHE
HAD BEAUTIFUL LIPS
AND I KISSED HER.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHEN YOU WERE 4,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.200
YOU TOLD TOPANGA
SHE HAD BEAUTIFUL LIPS?

13:04.200 --> 13:05.834
AND A VERY CUTE TUSH.

13:08.834 --> 13:10.500
I WANT WHAT YOU HAVE.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.967
THEN GO GET IT.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.367
ANGELA, HEAR ME OUT.
IT WILL JUST
TAKE A MINUTE.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.500
YOU DON'T MIND,
DO YOU?

13:22.500 --> 13:24.200
YOU WANT A FRY?

13:24.200 --> 13:26.400
LOOK, I READ THE
SAME BOOKS AS YOU,

13:26.400 --> 13:29.667
I LISTEN TO THE
SAME MUSIC, AND I GO
TO THE SAME MOVIES,

13:29.667 --> 13:32.467
SO WHEN I TELL YOU
HOW I FEEL,

13:32.467 --> 13:34.500
IT IS NOT
JUST WORDS.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.700
HUNTER, I'M
ON A DATE HERE.
COME ON.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.100
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

13:39.100 --> 13:42.767
WE WENT OUT. YOU TOLD ME
IT WAS ONLY GOING TO BE
FOR 2 WEEKS,

13:42.767 --> 13:44.200
AND THEN IT
WAS GOING TO BE OVER.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.667
I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE SCARED, OK?

13:46.667 --> 13:48.467
I'M SCARED, TOO.

13:48.467 --> 13:51.767
WE BOTH LOVE VIVALDI,
AND WE'RE BOTH SCARED.

13:51.767 --> 13:53.467
I'M SCARED, TOO.

13:53.467 --> 13:58.567
SHAWN, YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN IN A RELATIONSHIP
FOR LONGER THAN 2 WEEKS

13:58.567 --> 13:59.667
AND NEITHER HAVE I.

13:59.667 --> 14:02.200
WE WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.567
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS GETTING
TOO HEAVY FOR ME,

14:04.567 --> 14:06.900
SO I'M
TAKING MY FRIES,
AND I'M LEAVING.

14:06.900 --> 14:07.900
TED!

14:07.900 --> 14:10.000
OH, I PAID
FOR THESE FRIES.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.133
GIVE ME A CHANCE.

14:13.133 --> 14:14.900
I JUST WANT
TO SEE YOU.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.867
WELL, DAD, IT'S, UH,
ANOTHER ANNIVERSARY NIGHT
FOR ME AND TOPANGA.

14:21.867 --> 14:22.867
WHAT SAYS
I LOVE YOU MORE--

14:22.867 --> 14:24.700
A FERN OR A FICUS?

14:24.700 --> 14:27.133
CORY, HOW LONG HAVE
YOU AND TOPANGA
BEEN TOGETHER?

14:27.133 --> 14:28.800
WHY?

14:28.800 --> 14:30.033
WELL, SOMETIMES IT
SEEMS LIKE

14:30.033 --> 14:31.900
YOU'VE BEEN TOGETHER
LONGER THAN
ME AND YOUR MOM.

14:31.900 --> 14:34.500
ISN'T IT GREAT?

14:34.500 --> 14:39.367
CORY, I, UH,
TOLD HER THIS WAS A
VERY CASUAL EVENING.

14:39.367 --> 14:41.567
YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S MY CASUAL SUIT.

14:41.567 --> 14:43.300
WHY IS HE WEARING
YOUR SUIT?

14:43.300 --> 14:46.900
WELL, DAD, BECAUSE
TONIGHT ROMANCE AND LOVE
FILL THE AIR.

14:46.900 --> 14:48.767
YOU'RE 90!

14:49.834 --> 14:51.033
ALL RIGHT, NOW, LISTEN,

14:51.033 --> 14:54.600
YOU AND ANGELA HAVE 8:00
RESERVATIONS AT BARELLI'S.

14:54.600 --> 14:58.667
BARELLI'S? I DON'T
REALLY SEE ANGELA AND ME
IN A PLACE LIKE THAT.

14:58.667 --> 15:01.834
SHAWN, YOU SAID
YOU WANT TO BE
LIKE ME AND TOPANGA.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.200
WELL, ME AND TOPANGA
GO TO BARELLI'S

15:03.200 --> 15:06.667
BECAUSE BARELLI'S
IS THE PLACE
WHERE DREAMS COME TRUE.

15:06.667 --> 15:09.600
I MEAN, IT SAYS SO
ON THE MENU.

15:15.233 --> 15:17.200
SHAWN, THIS IS
REALLY FANCY.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.600
YOU THINK
THIS IS FANCY?

15:18.600 --> 15:21.200
I DON'T THINK
IT'S THAT FANCY.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.600
TOPANGA, WHY ARE YOU
ANGRY WITH ME?

15:27.600 --> 15:28.600
I MEAN, WAS IT THE FERN?

15:28.600 --> 15:29.934
BECAUSE FOR
THE EXTRA $2.00,

15:29.934 --> 15:31.867
I'LL HAPPILY CHANGE
IT FOR THE FICUS.

15:31.867 --> 15:34.200
CORY, IT WASN'T THE FERN.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE FERN!

15:34.200 --> 15:35.500
OK, THEN,
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

15:35.500 --> 15:38.200
LOOK, LET'S JUST TRY
TO GET THROUGH
THE EVENING, OK?

15:38.200 --> 15:39.600
<i>BUONA SERA. </i>

15:39.600 --> 15:42.367
OH, SIGNOR CORY.
SIGNORA TOPANGA.

15:42.367 --> 15:45.000
HOW MANY YEARS
YOU BEEN MARRIED
NOW, HUH?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.500
THE KIDS
ARE GOOD, NO?

15:46.500 --> 15:50.900
WE ARE NOT MARRIED,
AND WE DO NOT HAVE KIDS.

15:50.900 --> 15:52.200
EDUARDO. HA HA.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.233
SHE'S A LITTLE
ANGRY AT ME.
UH, HERE'S A FIVER.

15:55.233 --> 15:57.400
WHY DON'T YOU PUT
AN EXTRA SHRIMP
ON HER COCKTAIL?

15:57.400 --> 15:59.734
<i>SI. </i>
COME.OK.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.600
OH, SHAWN
AND ANGELA!

16:03.600 --> 16:04.800
WHAT A SURPRISE,
HUH?

16:04.800 --> 16:05.800
HI, GUYS.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.400
TALK ABOUT
COINCIDENCES.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.600
OF ALL THE
RESTAURANTS
IN THE TOWN.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.300
YEAH, AND
ALL THE SUITS.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.367
ENJOY.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.867
I'VE COME
TO TAKE YOUR ORDER.

16:18.867 --> 16:20.967
YOU NO TOUCH THE PATé.
IT'S NOT GOOD?

16:20.967 --> 16:23.000
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.967
UH, IT'S, UH,
<i>COME SI DICE? </i>

16:24.967 --> 16:27.800
UM, GOOSE LIVER.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.100
YOU REQUESTED IT
WHEN YOU TELEPHONED
THIS AFTERNOON.

16:30.100 --> 16:33.100
WHEN I CALLED,
DID I SOUND
LIKE I HAD CURLY HAIR

16:33.100 --> 16:34.400
AND WAS 90?

16:34.400 --> 16:35.467
<i>SI. </i>

16:35.467 --> 16:37.934
CORY? YOU'RE
LOOKING AT THEM

16:37.934 --> 16:39.367
MORE THAN
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.133
AH, LOOK
AT THOSE TWO.

16:41.133 --> 16:44.133
I MEAN, IT'S US
20 YEARS AGO.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.300
CORY, WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO US?

16:46.300 --> 16:48.500
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US?

16:48.500 --> 16:51.900
WE'RE OUT CELEBRATING
ANOTHER ONE OF OUR
DELIGHTFUL OCCASIONS.

16:51.900 --> 16:53.700
WHO TALKS LIKE THAT?

16:53.700 --> 16:55.967
SHAWN, YOU SAID
YOU KNEW ME.

16:55.967 --> 17:00.066
IF YOU REALLY KNEW
ME, WHY WOULD YOU
BRING ME HERE?

17:01.033 --> 17:04.300
BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M DOING.

17:05.500 --> 17:09.300
I--I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO BE MYSELF AROUND YOU.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.200
I--I REALLY WANT YOU
TO LIKE ME, ANGELA.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.033
I DO LIKE YOU.
IF I DIDN'T,
I WOULDN'T BE HERE.

17:15.033 --> 17:16.867
SO, THEN
WHY IS THIS SO HARD?

17:16.867 --> 17:21.734
I'VE NEVER
HAD A SERIOUS
RELATIONSHIP EITHER.

17:21.734 --> 17:23.100
EVERY TIME I GOT
CLOSE TO SOMEONE,

17:23.100 --> 17:25.133
I JUST FIGURED
IT WAS BEST
TO GET AWAY

17:25.133 --> 17:28.200
BEFORE WE HURT
EACH OTHER.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.834
IS SOMEONE
GOING TO GET HURT
HERE, SHAWN?

17:32.767 --> 17:34.100
NO.

17:35.400 --> 17:38.000
NO, NOT IF
WE'RE OURSELVES.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.700
HEY, EDUARDO.

17:40.700 --> 17:41.700
<i>SI. </i>

17:41.700 --> 17:42.700
COULD YOU
GET RID OF THIS

17:42.700 --> 17:45.867
AND JUST BRING US
A COUPLE OF BURGERS?

17:45.867 --> 17:47.233
YOU NO LIKE?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.233
NO.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.800
WE LIKE BURGERS.

17:49.800 --> 17:55.867
BARELLI'S IS A PLACE
WHERE ALL YOUR DREAMS
COME TRUE. 2 BURGERS!

17:55.867 --> 17:56.867
FRIES.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.600
OH, YEAH, AND
GET SOME KETCHUP, TOO.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.600
DO YOU MIND
IF I TAKE THIS TIE OFF?

18:02.600 --> 18:06.834
OH, PLEASE, NEVER WEAR
A TIE AGAIN, OK?

18:06.834 --> 18:09.700
WHY DO YOU HAVE
THAT THING ANYWAY?
IT CAN'T BE YOURS.

18:09.700 --> 18:14.367
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT ONE TO GIVE UP
ANY NAMES, BUT CORY.

18:14.367 --> 18:15.567
ALL OF THIS WAS CORY.

18:15.567 --> 18:18.200
HE'S A GOOD GUY.
HE JUST WANTS US TO HAVE

18:18.200 --> 18:19.500
WHAT HE AND
TOPANGA HAVE.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.133
THAT'S IT! THAT'S IT!
I HAVE HAD IT!

18:21.133 --> 18:24.400
I DON'T WANT TO PUT
THE SWEET 'N LOW
IN MY PURSE!

18:24.400 --> 18:26.200
SHH!

18:26.200 --> 18:28.300
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
US IN TROUBLE
IN OUR PLACE.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.133
I DON'T WANT THIS
TO BE OUR PLACE.

18:30.133 --> 18:31.367
YOU'RE RUINING
OUR ANNIVERSARY.

18:31.367 --> 18:33.567
WHAT ANNIVERSARY
IS THIS ANYWAY?

18:33.567 --> 18:35.867
IS THIS
THE FIRST TIME WE KISSED?
THE FIRST TIME WE WENT OUT?

18:35.867 --> 18:37.200
THE FIRST TIME WE MET?
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

18:37.200 --> 18:40.100
THE ANNIVERSARY
OF THE FIRST TIME
WE ATE AT BARELLI'S.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.400
HOW COULD YOU FORGET?

18:41.400 --> 18:42.500
BECAUSE I HATE BARELLI'S.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.367
I AM 50 YEARS AWAY
FROM GOING TO BARELLI'S.

18:44.367 --> 18:47.200
CAN'T WE JUST GO DOWNTOWN
AND GRAB A PRETZEL
FROM A CART?

18:47.200 --> 18:49.100
FINE. I'M NOT
MAKING YOU HAPPY. GO!

18:49.100 --> 18:51.600
YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING
TO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE
AT YOUR AGE?

18:52.700 --> 18:53.834
SIGNORA TOPANGA,

18:53.834 --> 18:56.200
I MUST REQUEST
THAT YOU KEEP
YOUR VOICE DOWN.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.100
[GROWLS]

18:58.100 --> 18:59.567
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

18:59.567 --> 19:01.400
THIS IS
WHAT SCARES ME.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.500
YOU GET CLOSE
TO SOMEONE,

19:02.500 --> 19:04.467
AND YOU
END UP HATING
EACH OTHER.

19:04.467 --> 19:06.400
ANGELA, THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE SCARED OF.

19:06.400 --> 19:09.233
WHEN 2 PEOPLE ARE
TRULY, TRULY IN LOVE,

19:09.233 --> 19:12.100
THERE'S NO WAY
THEY CAN END UP
HATING EACH OTHER.

19:12.100 --> 19:14.000
CORY, LOOK AT US!
I AM YELLING AT YOU,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.100
AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN
GETTING MAD AT ME.

19:16.100 --> 19:19.867
[HARMLESS GROWL]

19:19.867 --> 19:22.133
YOU CALL THAT A GROWL?

19:22.133 --> 19:24.300
THAT WAS PATHETIC.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.700
WELL, I COULD NEVER
REALLY GET MAD AT YOU.

19:26.700 --> 19:30.500
OH. CORY, I JUST
DON'T WANT TO CELEBRATE
ANY MORE OCCASIONS.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.967
I WAS JUST DOING IT
'CAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.

19:32.967 --> 19:36.700
NO. I JUST
WANT TO BE 17.

19:36.700 --> 19:40.667
ME, TOO.

19:42.367 --> 19:44.033
AAH!

19:48.667 --> 19:50.100
SHAWN.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.800
ANGELA?

19:54.467 --> 19:57.200
I WANT
WHAT THEY HAVE.

20:12.700 --> 20:13.700
IT'S THANKSGIVING
AND ALL WE HAVE

20:13.700 --> 20:15.934
IS AN EASTER BASKET
AND SANTA CLAUS.

20:15.934 --> 20:19.000
OH, MY DAD'S
GOING TO KILL YOU.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.400
I TOLD YOU WE'D RUIN
THANKSGIVING FOR EVERYBODY.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.400
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I GOT IT.

20:24.400 --> 20:25.400
I SPEND A FEW NIGHTS
IN THE HOSPITAL,

20:25.400 --> 20:26.400
THEY'LL FORGET ABOUT
THE WHOLE THING.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.667
HIT ME.
WHAT?

20:27.667 --> 20:29.700
HIT ME.
BUST ME IN THE NOSE.
CRACK A RIB. COME ON.

20:29.700 --> 20:31.000
ERIC, THAT'S
A STUPID IDEA.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.400
YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'LL HIT YOU.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.367
WHAT THE--

20:34.367 --> 20:36.500
COME ON, COME ON.
FACE OR GUT?

20:36.500 --> 20:39.233
[POUNDING ON DOOR]

20:39.233 --> 20:40.233
JUST A SECOND.

20:40.233 --> 20:42.200
I AM SORRY,
BUDDY.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.667
COME IN!

20:44.734 --> 20:47.767
HEY, LOOK, JACK,
THEY FOUND OUR TURKEY.

20:47.767 --> 20:48.867
DID YOU TWO
ACTUALLY BELIEVE

20:48.867 --> 20:51.600
THAT WE THOUGHT YOU
COULD PULL THIS OFF, HUH?

20:51.600 --> 20:52.900
YOU GUYS
CAN'T MAKE TOAST.

20:52.900 --> 20:55.600
ERIC, DO YOU AT LEAST
HAVE SOME CLEAN DISHES?

20:55.600 --> 20:56.700
NO.

20:56.700 --> 20:57.700
I'LL CARVE THE BIRD.

20:57.700 --> 21:00.100
NOW, EVERYBODY WANTS
DARK MEAT, RIGHT?

21:00.100 --> 21:01.467
All: NO!

21:01.467 --> 21:04.467
CORY, THIS IS SO NICE.
US ALL BEING TOGETHER
ON THANKSGIVING.

21:04.467 --> 21:07.367
YOU KNOW, I WANT
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

21:09.033 --> 21:13.200
I'M SO GLAD
I'M HERE, SHAWN.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.467
UM, BEFORE
WE SIT DOWN,

21:15.467 --> 21:19.300
I'D LIKE TO SAY THANKS
