00:13.545 --> 00:18.061
Tricia, I am so very sorry.
Have you been waiting long?

00:18.425 --> 00:22.623
We were supposed to meet at noon,
and it's now quarter to one.

00:22.971 --> 00:25.326
The most extraordinary thing happened.

00:25.599 --> 00:28.750
At least I'll get
a colourful anecdote out of this.

00:29.061 --> 00:31.211
- My watch stopped.
- I've got to go.

00:31.480 --> 00:34.153
That is extraordinary.
It's a Swiss timepiece.

00:34.441 --> 00:36.432
It only loses a minute per decade.

00:36.693 --> 00:41.448
And you've had it for what, 450 years?
I have an appointment at one.

00:41.823 --> 00:44.212
Please, let me have another chance.

00:44.493 --> 00:47.371
I'd love to get to know you better.

00:47.955 --> 00:50.867
I suppose even Swiss watches
sometimes stop.

00:51.166 --> 00:54.556
You'd be amazed how much fondue
gets overcooked that way.

00:56.213 --> 00:59.444
How about lunch tomorrow
at Le Petit Bistro?

00:59.758 --> 01:02.795
He'll give us the best table
in the house. Please?

01:03.095 --> 01:05.973
OK. I'll meet you there at one.

01:06.265 --> 01:08.938
- That's when the little hand is...
- Yes, I know.

01:10.018 --> 01:12.009
- See you then.
- OK.

01:16.316 --> 01:18.307
Frasier. Thank God you have room.

01:18.569 --> 01:24.201
I just spent ten stupefying minutes
sharing a table with a taxidermist.

01:24.616 --> 01:28.370
He doesn't have to stuff his trophies.
He can just bore them stiff.

01:28.704 --> 01:30.501
Who was that woman?

01:30.747 --> 01:33.215
A young lady I met
at the opera last night.

01:33.500 --> 01:38.449
It was remarkable.
Our hands touched, there was a spark.

01:38.839 --> 01:42.229
After ten minutes,
I knew I had to know her better.

01:42.551 --> 01:47.181
- Ever experience that sort of thing?
- I do know a thing or two about it.

01:47.556 --> 01:51.310
Excuse me. Can I have
the non-fat cappuccino, please?

01:51.643 --> 01:55.841
What am I to deduce,
that you've recently gotten lucky?

01:56.189 --> 02:00.546
Yes, and she lives in your building.
Five floors down. Allison Landis.

02:00.903 --> 02:04.213
You sneak. I don't even
know the woman. How did you two meet?

02:04.531 --> 02:08.763
On the elevator. I walked her to her
car where she'd locked her keys inside.

02:09.119 --> 02:12.668
- I saved the day.
- You got them out with a coat hanger?

02:12.998 --> 02:17.116
I called the auto club.
Where would I find a coat hanger?

02:17.461 --> 02:20.339
She invited me for lunch,
we hit it off.

02:20.631 --> 02:23.748
The next night I took her to dinner.
One thing led to another

02:24.051 --> 02:26.963
and soon there was
no further need for words.

02:27.262 --> 02:30.459
Except for your frantically-babbled
"thank yous".

02:30.766 --> 02:34.554
I'm seeing her tonight, so you'll
understand if I'm drained tomorrow

02:34.895 --> 02:37.773
at our squash game.
My love-making can get athletic.

02:38.065 --> 02:40.863
More than can be said
for your squash game.

02:41.151 --> 02:43.711
I've been away
from the seduction scene so long

02:43.987 --> 02:46.421
I was worried I'd lost my technique.

02:46.698 --> 02:49.337
Were those fears ever groundless.

02:50.786 --> 02:54.142
It's like French.
You can go without speaking it for years

02:54.456 --> 02:57.892
and then a few hours
on the boulevard d'amour, then you...

02:58.210 --> 03:01.407
- Where are you going?
- To sit with the taxidermist.

03:06.176 --> 03:08.644
I can't believe this has happened twice.

03:08.929 --> 03:12.842
- You had car trouble.
- Maybe she's still at Le Petit Bistro.

03:13.183 --> 03:16.459
She isn't. If you're talking
about someone named Tricia,

03:16.770 --> 03:20.683
she called to say she was leaving.
She said you were right about the table.

03:21.024 --> 03:25.336
It was a beautiful table and she wished
you were laid out dead on top of it.

03:29.366 --> 03:31.357
It's her machine.

03:32.202 --> 03:35.672
Hello, Tricia, it's Frasier.
I'm terribly sorry

03:35.998 --> 03:41.231
but my car battery went dead at a light
and I didn't have my cell phone.

03:41.628 --> 03:45.906
I couldn't go to the restaurant because
I was wearing ridiculous shorts.

03:46.258 --> 03:49.967
I know how this sounds but
it's the truth. Here, ask my brother.

03:50.304 --> 03:52.738
They're ridiculous shorts.

03:54.474 --> 03:57.147
Anyway, please give me one more chance.

03:57.436 --> 03:59.950
I'll go anywhere, anytime.

04:00.230 --> 04:03.063
Just give me a call.

04:03.358 --> 04:04.427
Please.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.351
May I have the phone?

04:07.613 --> 04:09.843
I had such
high hopes for this young woman.

04:10.115 --> 04:13.391
Now I've gone and blown it twice.
Whom are you calling?

04:13.702 --> 04:15.932
Allison. It's been hours since we spoke.

04:19.166 --> 04:21.156
Hello, there.

04:23.170 --> 04:25.161
How are you feeling?

04:25.631 --> 04:26.620
Me, too.

04:28.425 --> 04:30.017
Yeah, me too...

04:30.260 --> 04:33.013
Take it in my bedroom.

04:34.765 --> 04:36.995
You're making the dog twitch.

04:37.267 --> 04:40.942
You'll be so excited when you hear
what I got planned for your birthday.

04:41.271 --> 04:44.627
- I didn't want any fuss this year.
- Get ready to change your mind

04:44.942 --> 04:48.901
cos I scored tickets Friday night
to the best show in town.

04:49.947 --> 04:51.938
<i>Chimps On Ice.</i>

04:53.200 --> 04:54.189
Oh, my.

04:54.409 --> 04:57.367
I know this doesn't sound
like your cup of tea,

04:57.663 --> 05:00.302
but Duke saw it last week
and he busted a gut.

05:00.582 --> 05:03.301
And mind you,
he even saw it with the understudy.

05:04.419 --> 05:09.254
Dad, I really don't feel like going out
on my birthday this year.

05:09.633 --> 05:11.988
- Are you sure?
- Actually, I'd made plans.

05:12.261 --> 05:16.254
I was going to watch television. There's
a new production of <i>Cosi fan tutte.</i>

05:16.598 --> 05:18.509
No wonder, then.

05:19.768 --> 05:22.282
You're missing a treat.
Duke said at the finale

05:22.563 --> 05:25.600
the cast skates to the top
of a ramp and then splat!

05:25.899 --> 05:30.131
Right into a tank of whipped cream.
Bet they don't do that at your opera.

05:30.487 --> 05:33.365
No, and Mozart's still kicking himself.

05:33.657 --> 05:34.646
Come on, boy.

05:37.619 --> 05:40.895
Frasier, are you familiar
with the Safari Club?

05:41.206 --> 05:44.482
Of course.
Their yearly expeditions are remarkable.

05:44.793 --> 05:48.945
They're legendary. Last year they made
camp at the base of Mount Everest,

05:49.298 --> 05:52.927
then had their servants climb it
while they held a wine-tasting.

05:53.260 --> 05:56.696
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because Allison is a member.

05:57.014 --> 06:01.212
This Friday they're having a reception
at her place and we're invited.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.551
That's incredible.

06:05.147 --> 06:08.184
- Consider it your birthday present.
- Thank you so much.

06:08.483 --> 06:10.439
I told Dad I was going to stay home.

06:10.694 --> 06:12.969
- Don't tell him about this.
- Don't worry.

06:13.238 --> 06:16.196
I told him yesterday
I was going away for the weekend.

06:16.491 --> 06:21.281
- You knew about this yesterday?
- No, but I knew about <i>Chimps On Ice.</i>

06:29.588 --> 06:33.820
I understand one of the members
is going to show an old film he made

06:34.176 --> 06:38.692
of the rare and endangered species
found only in the rainforest.

06:39.056 --> 06:41.411
- Maris would have loved it.
- Why so?

06:41.683 --> 06:44.641
She had shoes made
from almost all of them.

06:45.187 --> 06:49.180
- Allison.
- Niles. And this must be Frasier.

06:49.524 --> 06:53.119
Come in, both of you. There are
lots of people I'd like you to meet.

06:55.948 --> 06:59.338
The bar is over there
and the hors d'oeuvres are here.

06:59.660 --> 07:03.653
We have some fascinating delicacies
actually bagged by our own members.

07:03.997 --> 07:07.831
This is ostrich, that's wildebeest
and that's springbok.

07:08.168 --> 07:13.196
I can never remember, is it
"fall ahead, spring bok" or vice versa?

07:16.426 --> 07:20.055
- I forgot I had this on me.
- Don't apologise. I do it myself.

07:20.389 --> 07:24.302
Even in the veldt one must
keep in touch with one's broker.

07:24.643 --> 07:28.158
- You can have privacy in the study.
- Thank you. Hello?

07:28.480 --> 07:30.755
You look ravishing tonight.

07:31.024 --> 07:35.415
Thank you. You and I should be
very discreet tonight.

07:35.779 --> 07:40.773
I'm a psychiatrist. If I can't be
discreet, it don't rain in Tanganyika.

07:41.159 --> 07:43.150
After all, if in the near future,

07:43.412 --> 07:46.051
you should be
up for membership in our club,

07:46.331 --> 07:49.607
I want to appear objective
when I sing your praises.

07:49.918 --> 07:52.352
My ears are already burning.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.513
Frasier, we're being
considered for membership.

07:57.801 --> 08:00.679
We must show them
how enthusiastic we are.

08:00.971 --> 08:03.087
- I have to leave.
- What?

08:03.348 --> 08:08.103
That was Tricia on the phone. She's
going out of town tonight for a month.

08:08.478 --> 08:11.675
But if I pick her up at her place,
we can at least have a drink.

08:11.982 --> 08:15.691
Are you insane? This is the Safari Club.

08:16.028 --> 08:20.067
These are the people who introduced
badminton to Devil's Island.

08:22.242 --> 08:26.281
They challenged the lepers of Molokai
to a three-legged race.

08:26.622 --> 08:31.093
I don't care. It was kismet
when I met Tricia. I must see her.

08:31.460 --> 08:34.816
To leave two minutes after arriving,
you'll ruin our chances.

08:35.130 --> 08:38.008
All right.
I'll make a proper excuse.

08:38.634 --> 08:41.102
Excuse me, Allison.
I'm terribly sorry.

08:41.385 --> 08:45.015
It seems I'm coming down with something.
I'm going to have to leave.

08:45.349 --> 08:49.740
If you feel better, please come back.
We'll be here all evening.

08:50.103 --> 08:54.858
Thank you, but I don't really
see that there's much hope.

08:56.818 --> 09:00.731
I'm just picking up my keys.
I will see you in ten minutes.

09:01.073 --> 09:03.541
And, Tricia, I can't wait.

09:04.159 --> 09:05.751
All right, bye.

09:08.163 --> 09:10.154
Surprise!

09:18.632 --> 09:21.863
We weren't going to let you
stay home alone on your birthday.

09:22.177 --> 09:25.533
- Look at him. He can't believe it.
- No, I certainly can't.

09:25.847 --> 09:30.284
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I dress like this sometimes

09:30.644 --> 09:34.034
when I watch the opera on television.

09:34.356 --> 09:36.392
That's up there on the dork meter.

09:36.650 --> 09:40.563
Since I'm not watching the opera,
I should buy a tape so I can record it.

09:40.904 --> 09:44.863
We're way ahead of you, Dr Crane.
Your father has the VCR all set up.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.476
Let's get things started.
Here you go, Doc, happy birthday.

09:48.787 --> 09:51.221
Thank you, Bulldog. Thank you, all.

09:51.498 --> 09:57.414
<i>David Copperfield.</i> Dickens' classic tale
of a man making his way in the world.

09:57.838 --> 10:00.955
I think we're talking about different
movies here, Doc.

10:01.967 --> 10:04.003
<i>David Cop-A-Feel.</i>

10:06.054 --> 10:08.329
But you were right
about the classic tail.

10:08.599 --> 10:11.511
- You need a brew? I'm headed that way.
- No, thanks.

10:11.810 --> 10:15.439
- I'd love a cup of hot tea with lemon.
- I'm fetching, not cooking.

10:15.772 --> 10:18.764
There's a kettle of boiling water
on the stove.

10:19.067 --> 10:21.865
Here you are.
Now don't be mad at your father.

10:22.154 --> 10:27.467
He wanted to do something nice after
you turned down the skating monkeys.

10:28.493 --> 10:32.247
Great party. As long as we've got
enough ice. Four bags, right?

10:32.581 --> 10:35.141
- No, I got two.
- Two? I told you to get four bags.

10:35.417 --> 10:37.885
But you never under-budget on the ice.

10:38.170 --> 10:41.321
You might get a lot
more rocks drinkers than you expected.

10:41.632 --> 10:44.988
- Or ice chewers...
- Dad, I can go get some more ice.

10:45.302 --> 10:48.214
We don't need any more ice.
There's a whole tub of it.

10:48.513 --> 10:52.108
Yes, well, then...
Excuse me. I need to make a call.

10:59.107 --> 11:01.302
Tricia? Frasier. I've been detained.

11:01.568 --> 11:04.640
Yes, I know that you
don't want to hear why, but...

11:04.947 --> 11:07.222
I think I can find a way
to get out of here.

11:07.491 --> 11:09.482
Yes, I'll see you in a few minutes.

11:13.497 --> 11:17.046
Dad, bad news.
Seems your ice is melting awfully fast.

11:17.376 --> 11:19.412
- What?
- I'll go get some more.

11:19.670 --> 11:23.345
No, it's your party. I'll go.
You just got here.

11:23.674 --> 11:27.030
Roz, it's my birthday. I can do
what I want. I want to get ice.

11:27.344 --> 11:29.460
I warned her. It's practically gone.

11:29.721 --> 11:32.110
Don't worry, Dad. I'm on it.

11:32.391 --> 11:35.827
- I'll be glad to go...
- I know what kind Dad likes.

11:40.357 --> 11:43.076
No, don't, don't stop on 14.
Just don't stop on 14.

11:46.655 --> 11:49.567
Frasier.
I'm delighted you're feeling better.

11:49.867 --> 11:54.145
We're about to start the film.
Wait until you see it.

11:54.496 --> 11:57.374
Just grab a chair
before all the good seats are gone.

11:59.376 --> 12:02.573
- What are you doing here?
- Wishing I had taken the stairs.

12:03.005 --> 12:05.473
Watch it.
If I'd wanted this martini shaken,

12:05.757 --> 12:08.191
I'd have asked the bartender
to do it.

12:10.429 --> 12:13.978
Mustn't mind old Rhino.
Always in a vile mood.

12:14.308 --> 12:17.186
- Rhino?
- Karl Landis, Allison's husband.

12:17.477 --> 12:20.787
They call him Rhino
because of his mean temper.

12:21.106 --> 12:23.256
Husband? Allison's married?

12:23.525 --> 12:28.041
Not surprised people don't know.
He's always on safari. Loves guns.

12:28.405 --> 12:32.159
Guns and women.
No secret, notorious for it.

12:32.492 --> 12:35.723
Cheats on her constantly.
Mark my words:

12:36.038 --> 12:40.156
One day she'll pay him back and
then rub his blood-thirsty nose in it.

12:43.837 --> 12:46.795
I think I just swallowed my tongue.

12:47.090 --> 12:49.809
Niles, just be calm. You didn't know.

12:50.093 --> 12:52.527
As long as you've both been discreet,

12:52.804 --> 12:55.364
there's no reason
it should get back to Rhino.

12:55.641 --> 12:58.519
- I don't know what you're insinuating.
- Don't lie.

12:58.810 --> 13:01.278
Everyone knows
what goes on in that pup tent.

13:01.563 --> 13:05.476
Well, I can play at that game, too.
In fact, I already have.

13:05.817 --> 13:10.811
And with somebody right here tonight.
How do you like that?

13:11.198 --> 13:15.635
I need you to create a distraction while
I have a sex change and move to Europe.

13:15.994 --> 13:20.226
I'm sorry, Niles. I would love to help,
but I've got to get out of here myself.

13:20.582 --> 13:23.779
Ready for the movie.
Mind helping me turn out the lights?

13:24.086 --> 13:28.238
Splendid idea. You're going to want it
nice and dark in here, aren't you?

13:28.590 --> 13:31.548
You should've told me
you were married. I must leave.

13:31.843 --> 13:35.836
If he sees someone sneak out,
that's the first person he'll suspect.

13:36.181 --> 13:37.170
All set?

13:38.350 --> 13:40.386
And it's show time.

13:40.644 --> 13:44.114
<i>Here under the leafy canopy
of the rainforest,</i>

13:44.439 --> 13:47.795
<i>the sun never penetrates
the gloom of the interior.</i>

13:48.110 --> 13:49.987
<i>An almost subterran...</i>

13:50.237 --> 13:53.035
- What happened?
- Did someone pull the plug out?

13:53.323 --> 13:55.678
Yup. Here it is.

13:55.951 --> 13:57.589
All right, lights out.

13:57.828 --> 14:01.662
<i>...quality permeates this hidden
kingdom deep in the underbrush</i>

14:01.999 --> 14:05.355
- <i>and all manner of creatures...</i>
- What was that?

14:05.669 --> 14:08.388
Someone certainly snuck out of here
in a hurry.

14:11.592 --> 14:13.583
I know what you're all thinking.

14:13.844 --> 14:17.996
Now that Allison has seen fit
to air our dirty laundry in public,

14:18.348 --> 14:21.897
you assume that was her lover.
But I know it wasn't.

14:24.938 --> 14:28.817
- How?
- I can sense that he's still here.

14:29.151 --> 14:34.942
In the jungle I learned
to smell fear and I smell it now.

14:36.909 --> 14:41.824
So, let's see whether the swine
has guts to stand up and admit it

14:42.206 --> 14:44.561
before I expose him.

14:44.833 --> 14:48.621
What about it, coward?
Going to stand up?

15:03.060 --> 15:07.178
That many? My God, woman,
you're as bad as I am.

15:08.732 --> 15:11.007
Come on, you bastards,
join me in a drink.

15:19.368 --> 15:22.360
Hi, Dr Crane. We're all
on our way up to your place.

15:22.663 --> 15:28.101
Noel, so you are. Hi, Tom, Janet,
Bill. I was just heading down.

15:28.502 --> 15:34.293
- We're out of ice.
- Not anymore. I brought a 20-pound bag.

15:34.716 --> 15:38.265
Just call me Noel Shempsky: Party Saver.

15:43.183 --> 15:46.573
Here's the ice. Here, Noel,
put that in the kitchen, will you?

15:47.771 --> 15:50.205
Dad, I went out without my wallet.

15:50.482 --> 15:53.315
They gave me the ice
but I have to go back and pay them.

15:53.610 --> 15:56.329
At least play
the last round of charades with us.

15:56.613 --> 15:59.923
- I should be getting back there.
- But you love charades.

16:00.242 --> 16:03.359
It won't kill them
to wait a few minutes for their money.

16:03.662 --> 16:05.812
Be on our team. We really suck at this.

16:06.081 --> 16:10.074
- The category is famous play titles.
- I'm a bear at charades.

16:11.420 --> 16:12.409
You ready?

16:12.629 --> 16:14.620
- Yeah.
- All right, go.

16:15.674 --> 16:17.744
Three words. First word.

16:18.886 --> 16:20.524
<i>Mourning Becomes Electra.</i>

16:20.762 --> 16:23.720
- Yes!
- What? Four seconds?

16:25.183 --> 16:29.176
Well done, Roz. Nice playing with you.
I'm out of here.

16:29.521 --> 16:33.116
You have to take a turn.
You have 30 seconds to prepare.

16:33.442 --> 16:36.957
Well, all right.
Maybe I'll just prepare in the kitchen.

16:43.118 --> 16:47.077
Tricia! You're going to laugh
when you hear this. Hello? Tricia?

16:49.708 --> 16:50.697
Fine.

16:53.045 --> 16:55.275
<i>The Iceman Cometh</i>

16:57.007 --> 17:00.079
- All right.
- Ready? OK, go.

17:01.261 --> 17:03.331
Three words. First word.

17:03.597 --> 17:05.588
A small word.

17:05.848 --> 17:08.568
On? In? Of? To?

17:08.852 --> 17:11.082
Be? Is? It? I? You? Me?

17:11.355 --> 17:13.949
They, them, us, we, he, she.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.790
Forget about it.

17:16.026 --> 17:18.061
OK, second word. Two syllables.

17:18.319 --> 17:20.470
First syllable.

17:20.739 --> 17:22.969
Cold, chilly, freezing, winter.

17:23.242 --> 17:27.121
Snow, sleet, hail, frost,
frostbite, gangrene.

17:27.454 --> 17:30.048
- Gangrene?
- No talking allowed.

17:31.959 --> 17:33.278
Second syllable.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.848
Shrink. Doctor. Dork.

17:39.216 --> 17:41.605
Person, guy, male, man.

17:41.885 --> 17:46.242
Man, man, man. Let's see,
Icy cold man, ice man. Got it.

17:46.598 --> 17:49.396
- Thank you.
- <i>Frosty The Snowman.</i> Yes!

17:49.685 --> 17:52.404
No, you jackass! <i>The Iceman Cometh.</i>

17:52.688 --> 17:54.041
Disqualified.

17:54.273 --> 17:57.504
You two are the worst charades players
I've ever seen.

17:57.818 --> 18:00.491
Those skating chimps could...

18:00.779 --> 18:03.816
You did your best.
We'll get it next time. Off I go.

18:04.116 --> 18:07.552
No, wait, Frasier. We still have
a consolation prize for you.

18:19.214 --> 18:21.205
Look, he's crying.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.395
- Made it.
- Boy, are you wrong.

18:48.660 --> 18:51.970
I have a plane
leaving for Spokane in an hour.

18:52.289 --> 18:56.328
My cab is on the way, so why don't
you just be on your way, too?

18:56.668 --> 18:59.023
But I had to sneak out
of a birthday party

18:59.296 --> 19:02.606
being given for me by my own father
just to come here.

19:02.925 --> 19:05.234
Yeah, right. It's your birthday.

19:05.510 --> 19:08.741
If you don't believe me, here,
just see for yourself.

19:09.056 --> 19:11.809
It's the worst birthday
I've had since I was eight,

19:12.100 --> 19:14.409
when I pinned
the tail on Sally Annunciato.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.836
She shoved a cupcake down my shorts.

19:17.940 --> 19:21.899
You really blew off your own
birthday party just to come meet me.

19:22.236 --> 19:26.070
I would've done almost anything
to get to know you better.

19:26.406 --> 19:29.204
That's very sweet,
and I wish I had more time

19:29.493 --> 19:33.725
but I have an 8.00am appointment
in Spokane and I can't miss my plane.

19:34.081 --> 19:37.960
- I could drive you.
- It's only 20 minutes to the airport.

19:38.293 --> 19:41.285
- I wasn't talking about the airport.
- What?

19:41.588 --> 19:45.547
I can get to Spokane in six hours.
Enough time to get acquainted.

19:45.884 --> 19:48.956
- I can't ask you to do that.
- You didn't ask. I offered.

19:49.263 --> 19:50.742
I want to do it. Here...

19:51.682 --> 19:54.401
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

19:54.685 --> 19:59.315
One of two things can happen. We'll
discover that we've built each other up

19:59.690 --> 20:02.363
because we had such trouble
getting together,

20:02.651 --> 20:07.202
or this could end up being a story
we tell our grandchildren.

20:09.658 --> 20:12.809
Personally,
I can't wait to find out which.

20:13.787 --> 20:15.345
Me neither.

20:26.925 --> 20:28.597
Off we go.

20:36.018 --> 20:38.532
I thought I'd find us
some background music.

20:38.812 --> 20:42.088
Good idea.
Looking for some more opera?

20:42.399 --> 20:45.311
No. The one the other night
was my first and last.

20:45.611 --> 20:48.648
I was dragged to it
by one of my converts.

20:49.823 --> 20:51.620
There we go.

20:52.868 --> 20:54.904
Converts, you say?

20:55.162 --> 20:58.871
I'm one of the Truth-Bringers.
I was ordained by Brother Carmichael.

20:59.208 --> 21:03.281
The evangelist? I go door-to-door,
spreading his word.

21:06.548 --> 21:10.621
Do you mind my asking something?
Have you heard the truth?

21:14.223 --> 21:16.737
Something tells me I'm about to.
