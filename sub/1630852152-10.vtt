00:03.879 --> 00:06.632
Hello. I'm Lola Valdivieso.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.010
If you're seeing this video,
it's because I'm dead.

00:12.012 --> 00:15.099
A few months ago, I started to research
Ignacio Santamaría and his partners,

00:16.058 --> 00:18.728
Félix Ferrer and Mariana Durán,

00:18.769 --> 00:21.063
founders of the cannabis
company KannaLab.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.109
The information I found
led me to link KannaLab

00:25.151 --> 00:27.319
to the murder of Assaf Dahur,

00:27.361 --> 00:29.655
an Israeli whose body
was found in Tayrona.

00:31.115 --> 00:33.743
It seems the homicide is related
to the theft of a seed

00:33.784 --> 00:35.494
the Israeli was developing,

00:36.203 --> 00:37.663
which placed KannaLab

00:37.705 --> 00:40.499
among the most important cannabis
companies in the country.

00:41.917 --> 00:42.585
I want to make it clear

00:44.086 --> 00:47.089
that Ignacio Santamaría,
Félix Ferrer, and Mariana Durán

00:47.131 --> 00:48.924
are directly
responsible for my death.

02:05.876 --> 02:06.877
The money!

02:08.462 --> 02:10.881
We left the fucking briefcase
with the money.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.341
I'm not fucking
going back there.

02:12.383 --> 02:13.551
It's all I have, man.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.845
We have to leave before
someone sees us.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.930
There's Assaf's car.
Let's try to take it.

02:17.972 --> 02:21.058
What're you saying, Félix?
We can't use that car!

02:21.100 --> 02:22.518
We have to walk.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.353
And we have to go separately.

02:24.395 --> 02:26.146
Nobody can know we were here.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.983
Nobody can link us to this.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.527
We have to split up.

02:33.946 --> 02:36.282
And promise we won't see
each other again.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.909
The fuck are you saying? Everyone
saw us at that shit party.

02:38.951 --> 02:42.246
It was full of drugs, Ignacio! Nobody
has a fucking clue what happened.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.126
So it's clear.

02:50.379 --> 02:51.589
We go our separate ways.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.466
And we never see each
other again.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.260
This never happened.

02:59.305 --> 03:00.264
Félix.

03:05.728 --> 03:07.062
This never happened.

03:15.571 --> 03:16.655
It never happened.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.759
Our lab has spent days
analyzing your product

05:00.801 --> 05:01.969
and the results are...

05:03.095 --> 05:04.221
impeccable.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.058
I've worked with dozens
of companies,

05:08.100 --> 05:09.685
and nobody's ever delivered

05:09.727 --> 05:11.103
such a perfect order

05:11.145 --> 05:12.479
and in so little time.

05:16.734 --> 05:18.152
It wasn't easy.

05:20.696 --> 05:23.490
Nothing's easy when it comes
to achieving great things.

05:26.577 --> 05:29.997
I imagine you didn't come to Colombia
just to shower us with praise.

05:33.167 --> 05:36.253
What would you say if
I told you...

05:38.088 --> 05:39.798
I invite you to
change the world.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.261
That sounds too pretentious,
huh?

05:45.637 --> 05:47.723
Has anyone done it
without being pretentious?

05:50.642 --> 05:51.894
Mark Zuckerberg was

05:51.935 --> 05:54.730
19 when he founded Facebook.

05:54.772 --> 05:57.733
Larry Page and Sergey Brin were

05:57.775 --> 05:59.151
23

05:59.193 --> 06:02.529
when they wrote an indexing
algorithm that became

06:02.571 --> 06:03.405
Google.

06:04.990 --> 06:08.786
Many say that people who
change paradigms

06:08.827 --> 06:12.456
do so when they're young because
that's when the brain's at its peak.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.750
I think the opposite.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.878
They actually do it because...

06:19.046 --> 06:20.881
young people are stupid.

06:22.382 --> 06:26.595
And when you're stupid,
you dare do impossible things,

06:27.471 --> 06:28.889
like change the world.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.477
If I told you we agreed

06:33.519 --> 06:35.145
with what you're saying,

06:36.230 --> 06:37.606
where would it take us?

06:43.487 --> 06:46.615
It would take us to build
the impossible, Mariana.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.043
What is it?

06:59.503 --> 07:01.004
It's a contract.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.757
To turn KannaLab

07:03.799 --> 07:05.884
into the heart of New Soul.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.928
You want to buy us?

07:10.055 --> 07:12.307
That's a very simplistic
way of seeing it.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.478
I want us to become

07:16.520 --> 07:17.896
one single thing,

07:19.940 --> 07:22.109
an unstoppable engine,

07:23.235 --> 07:24.611
a legend.

07:25.654 --> 07:26.864
If you accept,

07:26.905 --> 07:29.032
KannaLab would be in charge of

07:29.074 --> 07:32.452
making our product reach
every corner of the world.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.040
You already delivered
50 liters of cannabis.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.042
Now we need

07:39.626 --> 07:40.544
5,000.

07:41.920 --> 07:42.963
And in 10 months,

07:44.006 --> 07:45.299
50,000.

07:51.054 --> 07:54.016
If this isn't changing the world,
then what is it?

08:02.649 --> 08:03.817
Think it over.

08:08.530 --> 08:12.367
I know it isn't easy to determine
if you're ready for this or not.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.828
But, believe me, I know

08:15.787 --> 08:18.999
you three... are ready.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.522
Ready? You done?

08:45.234 --> 08:47.444
- It's what we always wanted.
- It's perfect.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.949
Just because it's perfect doesn't
mean it's perfect for us.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.660
What do you mean?

08:54.701 --> 08:56.286
This doesn't make any sense,
Nacho.

08:57.246 --> 08:58.830
A contract to change the world?

08:59.831 --> 09:01.375
Come on, man.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.918
No corporation's ever changed
the world for the better.

09:04.461 --> 09:06.630
We've spent months chasing
a dream that'll take us nowhere.

09:08.382 --> 09:11.593
So we're the first ones to export,
so what? We become a legend?

09:12.678 --> 09:13.971
What does that mean?

09:15.305 --> 09:17.516
I want to change lives,
change them for real.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.435
You don't want to sign?

09:22.896 --> 09:23.897
No, Mari.

09:24.856 --> 09:28.402
Especially when we know that Colombia
will legalize recreational use.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.569
That won't happen.

09:29.611 --> 09:30.737
Then let's make it happen,
Nacho.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.907
I always dreamed
of having boutiques

09:33.949 --> 09:36.910
where we can captivate people
with the product.

09:36.952 --> 09:41.415
Where we have doctors specializing in
helping people to manage pain with CBD.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.876
You know what I'm talking about.

09:49.631 --> 09:52.217
Let's change the world's perception
of cannabis.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.635
You think that's very easy?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.596
When did we ever do what's easy?

09:56.638 --> 09:59.891
My whole family's fighting to make
the legalization fall through.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.102
You have no idea
what they're capable of.

10:02.144 --> 10:04.438
Since when are you
so scared of your family?

10:04.479 --> 10:05.772
I'm not scared, man.
I'm being realistic.

10:07.691 --> 10:11.028
There's a journalist about to uncover
us and all this will go to hell.

10:12.529 --> 10:15.115
Shouldn't it be for something we
truly believe in?

10:15.157 --> 10:17.284
But if we sign with Ilana,

10:17.326 --> 10:20.412
they can help manage the article
if it gets published.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.122
Exactly.

10:24.666 --> 10:29.171
If I'm going to keep taking risks,
it'll be for something I believe in.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.800
You'll have to put up with this

10:33.842 --> 10:35.844
and give in,
because we're deciding this now.

10:37.054 --> 10:39.556
And we'll decide like
we've always done.

10:39.598 --> 10:40.724
I'm going to sign.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.520
- Careful what you say.
- She also wants to sign.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.981
She doesn't want to be
part of a corporation.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.442
She wants to change
everything, but for real.

10:51.860 --> 10:52.694
Mari,

10:55.739 --> 10:58.575
you also want to get all the noise
out of your head, right?

11:02.704 --> 11:03.997
You'll sign, yeah?

11:06.958 --> 11:08.502
You'll sign, right?

11:10.212 --> 11:11.421
Enough.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.140
You have no fucking clue
the mess you just put us in.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.147
See, Santamaría?
You're scared, not realistic.

11:53.547 --> 11:56.883
FELIPE TURN ON THE NEWS...

12:02.764 --> 12:06.685
<i>I</i> <i>left</i> <i>home</i> <i>because</i> <i>I</i> <i>had</i> <i>a
trip</i> <i>early</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>morning.</i>

12:08.520 --> 12:12.190
<i>I was already in the
taxi when suddenly</i>

12:12.232 --> 12:14.317
<i>a car appeared at full speed.</i>

12:14.359 --> 12:17.028
<i>And it crashed into me.
I didn't have time to react.</i>

12:17.946 --> 12:19.739
<i>When I woke up at the hospital,</i>

12:21.199 --> 12:24.578
<i>they told me I was paralyzed
from the waist down.</i>

12:26.204 --> 12:28.790
<i>Two days later, some
lawyers showed up.</i>

12:30.208 --> 12:32.711
<i>They came on behalf of
Ignacio Santamaría.</i>

12:34.171 --> 12:37.257
<i>It seems he was drunk
when he crashed into my taxi.</i>

12:37.299 --> 12:40.594
<i>JORGE GUZMAN TELLS WHAT HAPPENED
THE MORNING OF THE ACCIDENT</i>

12:44.848 --> 12:47.976
FELIPE IS IT CLEAR, COUSIN?

13:05.243 --> 13:06.077
And Teo?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.663
He said to wait.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.962
I didn't want to hurt you.

13:16.004 --> 13:16.838
No?

13:18.673 --> 13:19.841
I'm serious.

13:21.009 --> 13:23.428
When Camila's serious,
she's serious.

13:25.388 --> 13:27.849
My sister still thinks
she has a good heart.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.818
The money's in your account.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.112
This shit is over.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.116
What do you think, Camila?
What's your good heart say?

13:46.743 --> 13:48.995
I think it isn't over yet.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.455
So do I.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.959
Why don't you leave me alone?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.835
Why do you see me as an enemy?

13:55.877 --> 13:57.921
How do you want me to see you,
like my best friend?

13:57.963 --> 13:59.589
We're on the same team.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.634
Go to hell.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.137
How can I leave if
we're partners?

14:08.139 --> 14:10.517
Half of your shares
in the company are mine.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.521
You'll have to see me,
whether you like it or not.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.734
Ever thought of putting your brother
in a mental clinic?

14:22.279 --> 14:24.239
Look, it's logical.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.367
You and I will go to a
notary tomorrow,

14:28.535 --> 14:31.454
and you'll sign a
document that gives me

14:32.372 --> 14:34.124
half of your shares in KannaLab.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.293
And why would I do that?

14:37.294 --> 14:39.921
If you don't, I'll tell the government
about the stolen cannabis bags.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.800
And you and your friends
will lose your permit.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.472
If you ever talk,

14:50.056 --> 14:51.182
I'll kill you.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.521
You think Félix is
capable of killing me?

15:01.651 --> 15:02.736
Me neither.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.531
Because Félix is a puppet.

15:08.074 --> 15:11.661
He's an aimless doll
and if nobody pulls his strings,

15:14.205 --> 15:15.206
he doesn't move.

15:19.878 --> 15:21.463
See you tomorrow to sign.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.464
I'LL SEND YOU A
MESSAGE EVERY DAY.

16:04.506 --> 16:07.050
IF YOU DON'T GET ONE,
PUBLISH THE VIDEO.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.426
DON'T WATCH IT UNTIL THEN. LOLA.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.185
Hello.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.104
<i>I just got your envelope.
What's going on?</i>

16:21.606 --> 16:23.274
- I told you.
- <i>No, you didn't.</i>

16:26.319 --> 16:28.071
I told you what I had
to tell you.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.614
<i>God, Lola, where are you?</i>

16:32.617 --> 16:34.035
I can't tell you.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.578
<i>Is it that serious?</i>

16:37.872 --> 16:39.624
Stop whatever you're doing
and come back.

16:39.666 --> 16:40.917
<i>Come back where?</i>

16:40.959 --> 16:42.919
Come to my house
and I'll make sure you're safe.

16:44.045 --> 16:45.755
<i>I'm not safe anywhere.</i>

16:45.797 --> 16:48.508
You know in this country they kill
anyone who tries to speak up.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.845
That's why we're journalists:
to speak up.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.598
What's left of us if we
let them scare us?

17:00.687 --> 17:02.147
You know they'll go after you?

17:04.482 --> 17:07.068
The investigation's with the
video. Make sure you publish it.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.738
<i>Tell me where you are
and I'll come.</i>

17:13.032 --> 17:14.242
No, Valeria.

17:16.119 --> 17:19.122
You can't come where I am,
because I'm nowhere.

17:19.956 --> 17:22.333
Lola. Lola!

20:00.325 --> 20:03.536
Was it a good idea to break the pact
on not seeing each other again?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.793
We wouldn't have any of this.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.796
Was it worth it?

20:13.838 --> 20:15.798
I don't regret
breaking the pact.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.641
Do you really want to fight
for legalization?

20:25.975 --> 20:28.603
I really want to fight
for my fucking dreams.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.399
But it's crazy.
You're aware of that, right?

20:34.734 --> 20:37.362
Ilana said young people
only do stupid things.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.074
Yeah.

20:42.659 --> 20:45.078
Like turn down
multi-million dollar contracts.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.080
Since when has this been
about the money?

20:52.627 --> 20:53.628
So,

20:55.964 --> 20:58.675
we'll fight for legalization,
to the very end.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.269
Something tells me
I'll regret this.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.941
It wouldn't be the first time
you regret something, doll face.

21:23.241 --> 21:24.325
To the very end, then?

21:36.004 --> 21:37.296
To the very end.

21:52.729 --> 21:55.940
After two weeks of negotiation
with the insurance companies,

21:55.982 --> 21:57.650
they called me today

21:57.692 --> 21:59.986
to set up an urgent meeting.

22:00.028 --> 22:03.614
And it's surely to confirm

22:03.656 --> 22:06.075
the approval of the
new contract.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.832
The board meeting
started an hour ago.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.543
Traffic's horrible.

22:17.378 --> 22:19.047
It must be really shitty,

22:19.088 --> 22:21.090
and I mean the traffic,

22:21.132 --> 22:23.384
since you missed
the last seven meetings.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.972
I only come to the
important meetings.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.099
And what's special
about this one?

22:31.976 --> 22:34.395
I'd rather talk about
it at the end.

22:44.113 --> 22:44.947
No.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.409
Let's deal with your
issues first.

22:49.744 --> 22:52.497
So we can all relax.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.420
Okay.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.677
As you all know,

23:06.719 --> 23:10.431
51% of this company's lands

23:10.473 --> 23:11.974
are under my name.

23:12.016 --> 23:13.559
And, in the past few days,

23:13.601 --> 23:16.938
I've been pressured
in the most atrocious ways

23:16.979 --> 23:20.149
to hand my lands over
to this company.

23:20.191 --> 23:23.861
So, I've decided to
revoke any permission

23:23.903 --> 23:25.822
Rosalía has to use them.

23:25.863 --> 23:29.325
A dispute like that would take
years. Don't be naive, Mariana.

23:31.077 --> 23:35.456
The meeting the insurance requested
isn't to approve the contract.

23:36.916 --> 23:40.294
It's to tell you they won't risk
insuring the production,

23:40.336 --> 23:44.048
considering there's a dispute
that may last years.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.008
So you're going to kill
this company?

23:50.763 --> 23:52.014
Would you give us a moment?

23:52.056 --> 23:53.599
No. Nobody leaves.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.434
Would you give us a moment,
gentlemen?

24:12.285 --> 24:15.288
You think this is your little company
and you can waltz in

24:15.329 --> 24:17.582
and do whatever you want.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.172
Actually,

24:24.213 --> 24:25.673
yes.

24:25.715 --> 24:28.509
It's also my little company,
in case you hadn't realized.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.305
You never cared about it.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.142
I cared for a long time,

24:37.685 --> 24:39.395
more than I should have.

24:47.862 --> 24:50.698
It's a good thing
your mother isn't on this Earth.

24:52.909 --> 24:54.785
Because I'm sure she'd be

24:54.827 --> 24:57.163
deeply disappointed in you.

24:59.123 --> 24:59.957
In me?

25:02.501 --> 25:05.546
Or in all the years she chose to live
with a monster like you?

25:05.588 --> 25:08.257
How dare you say that!
Insolent!

25:08.299 --> 25:09.884
Why do you think Mom
left me more land?

25:11.052 --> 25:13.554
Because she knew
she couldn't trust you.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.058
Susana told me what you did.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.104
You won't deny it?

25:23.481 --> 25:24.690
You won't say anything?

25:42.458 --> 25:45.127
See how you're destroying this
all on your own?

25:47.797 --> 25:49.632
No, this isn't over yet.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.611
Of course it's over.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.241
There's nothing left here.

26:45.187 --> 26:46.147
What's up, son?

26:47.023 --> 26:47.648
Hey.

26:48.691 --> 26:50.067
You won't guess where the
journalist is.

26:51.777 --> 26:54.864
You think I would've asked for
your help if I could've guessed?

26:57.408 --> 26:59.160
This is the address
where she's at.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.708
She's in Tayrona.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.506
What's Lola doing in Tayrona?

27:12.548 --> 27:13.799
We don't know.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.054
I thought you'd give me a clue.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.726
No, I don't know
what she's looking for.

27:26.979 --> 27:30.316
Does it have anything to do with
the purchase of seeds over there?

27:34.862 --> 27:36.489
I told you I don't know.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.702
You're not fooling me, son.

27:42.870 --> 27:43.746
What's going on?

28:06.143 --> 28:07.395
It's best you don't know.

28:10.272 --> 28:12.358
Did you forget the gun

28:12.400 --> 28:15.069
you took to Tayrona was mine?

28:32.461 --> 28:34.380
Don't get me into trouble.

29:01.991 --> 29:03.033
And Carmenza?

29:04.410 --> 29:05.953
I have to take you to
the airport.

29:07.413 --> 29:10.291
Carmenza decided she's not coming
with me to Italy.

29:10.332 --> 29:11.208
What?

29:13.794 --> 29:16.422
She's a bit worried
about my health.

29:16.464 --> 29:20.426
She doesn't want to have to hospitalize
me in Italy.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.304
And she waited until
now to tell you?

29:24.972 --> 29:26.390
I'll talk with her if you want.

29:26.849 --> 29:27.683
No.

29:28.601 --> 29:29.768
She's absolutely right.

29:32.646 --> 29:33.772
What's wrong?

29:39.069 --> 29:40.529
What's wrong, Mom?

29:43.365 --> 29:44.992
I'm not getting better.

29:49.497 --> 29:50.873
And Carmenza knows.

29:58.339 --> 30:01.008
I've got about two or
three months left.

30:24.365 --> 30:25.658
Then let's go.

30:26.742 --> 30:27.660
What are you saying?

30:27.701 --> 30:29.119
To Italy.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.622
- What else?
- Didn't you just hear that Carmenza...

30:31.664 --> 30:32.998
Me and you, Mom.

30:35.918 --> 30:38.254
Let's not waste any more time.
You and I will go.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.150
I love you.

33:21.041 --> 33:21.875
Lola!

33:24.336 --> 33:25.504
I'm just here to talk.

33:26.296 --> 33:27.881
The police know I'm here.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.550
The police? What are you
talking about?

33:29.591 --> 33:30.592
How'd you find me?

33:31.719 --> 33:32.469
How long have you spying on me?

33:33.887 --> 33:36.223
I'm not spying on you,
I looked everywhere for you.

33:36.265 --> 33:37.891
Why? To kill me?

33:39.143 --> 33:41.061
You really think
I'm capable of killing you?

33:41.103 --> 33:42.771
Does Assaf Dahur ring a bell?

33:44.898 --> 33:48.026
If anything happens to me, they'll
publish my article and you'll go to jail.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.236
- Hear me out.
- More lies!

33:49.278 --> 33:51.655
You think I came
all this way to lie to you?

33:53.824 --> 33:55.534
It doesn't matter what I think.
Facts are facts.

33:55.576 --> 33:57.119
What are the facts?

33:57.161 --> 34:00.414
You killed the Israeli to take
the seed that brought you glory.

34:01.957 --> 34:03.167
That was an accident.

34:04.460 --> 34:07.129
How do you shoot someone
point-blank on accident?

34:10.507 --> 34:12.134
It was a blow to the head.

34:12.176 --> 34:13.427
I saw the investigation.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.679
I saw where he died.

34:16.430 --> 34:17.681
You blew his brains out.

34:19.433 --> 34:21.435
It seems I'm not the
only one spying.

34:22.603 --> 34:23.896
Investigating.

34:23.937 --> 34:26.607
So that's what this was,
an investigation?

34:26.648 --> 34:28.025
A farce from the beginning?

34:30.611 --> 34:33.322
What does the beginning matter
if this is the end?

34:33.363 --> 34:34.782
And what's this end?

34:35.908 --> 34:38.368
You forget your name,
your privileges,

34:39.703 --> 34:40.996
and pay for the crime.

34:41.038 --> 34:43.165
- A crime I didn't commit.
- Tell the judge, not me.

34:43.207 --> 34:45.709
You know me and won't believe me.
How will a judge?

34:49.338 --> 34:50.589
I don't know you, Ignacio.

34:54.635 --> 34:56.553
It's the first time you
call me Ignacio.

34:58.931 --> 35:00.182
What changed, Lola?

35:03.060 --> 35:03.894
Leave.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.357
And get ready to go to prison.

35:08.398 --> 35:09.817
That's a tragic path, right?

35:19.076 --> 35:20.619
We're all tragedies, I told you.

35:23.288 --> 35:25.874
But few of us are realistic enough
to accept it.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.003
What about that thing
called hope?

35:33.257 --> 35:35.133
Not here, in this life.

35:36.718 --> 35:37.803
Then where?

35:38.887 --> 35:41.098
"Far away," you said.

35:44.852 --> 35:45.894
"In front of the sea."

35:48.021 --> 35:49.022
Here we are.

35:50.232 --> 35:51.108
In front of the sea.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.029
One tragedy, facing another.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.828
If you publish that article,
you'll ruin my life.

36:07.332 --> 36:08.709
Didn't you come to kill me?

36:11.003 --> 36:12.045
Then kill me.

36:16.133 --> 36:17.926
It's the last thing left to do.

36:51.084 --> 36:53.128
Honestly, I wasn't surprised
when you called.

36:55.589 --> 36:58.091
Maybe because all this
was inevitable.

37:00.177 --> 37:01.803
What was inevitable, Virgilio?

37:04.014 --> 37:06.308
That I would decide
to do business with you.

37:09.353 --> 37:11.146
Well, if you're doing this

37:11.188 --> 37:14.566
to annoy your daughter, let me tell
you we don't like getting involved.

37:16.693 --> 37:19.488
And if I told you that someone
who used to work for them

37:20.614 --> 37:23.784
managed to get a
cutting from a plant?

37:24.826 --> 37:27.412
A cutting that could even

37:27.454 --> 37:29.623
exceed KannaLab's quality?

37:31.917 --> 37:34.795
I thought they stopped
the robbery, the sabotage.

37:36.672 --> 37:38.173
You thought wrong.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.393
What do you need from us?

38:12.082 --> 38:12.624
Hello, Gabriel.

38:13.834 --> 38:15.919
<i>Some government workers
just arrived.</i>

38:15.961 --> 38:18.588
They say they have to check
the number of cannabis bags.

38:20.215 --> 38:23.593
No, they can't, please.
They can't go in.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.929
<i>Mariana, they have a warrant.</i>

38:25.971 --> 38:27.222
I can't do anything.

38:29.099 --> 38:30.600
They're going in right now.

38:54.541 --> 38:55.459
Espinoza.

38:56.793 --> 38:57.669
I did what you asked.

38:59.129 --> 39:02.215
We checked the caliber
of the gun from your picture.

39:03.633 --> 39:04.593
It doesn't match.

39:06.803 --> 39:07.804
What do you mean?

39:08.930 --> 39:11.892
<i>The gun that killed Assaf
isn't the one in your picture.</i>

39:47.094 --> 39:50.514
Did you forget the gun you
took to Tayrona

39:50.555 --> 39:51.640
was mine?

39:54.518 --> 39:56.269
Don't get me into trouble.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.525
Maybe the journalist is
investigating

40:01.566 --> 40:03.568
what you did that night.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.197
We didn't do
anything that night.

40:10.951 --> 40:12.994
And if she keeps on
investigating,

40:19.835 --> 40:21.378
where will she end up?

40:53.493 --> 40:55.412
Don't worry, I got it all
under control.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.705
You?

40:59.207 --> 41:01.001
Don't make me laugh.

41:05.088 --> 41:06.423
Thanks for the information.
