WEBVTT

00:04.400 --> 00:06.200
- HEY, HERE'S A QUESTION
I HAVE.

00:06.233 --> 00:08.333
DO I NEED A SEPARATE
CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR

00:08.367 --> 00:10.667
OR I SHOULD I JUST GET
ONE OF THESE COMBO JOBBERS?

00:10.700 --> 00:12.633
- WHO CARES? I'M SO BORED,
I WANNA KILL MYSELF.

00:12.667 --> 00:14.300
- WELL, IF WE BUY
THE WRONG THING, YOU WON'T

00:14.333 --> 00:15.767
HAVE TO KILL YOURSELF.
- OH, MY GOD! MAGS, SHUT UP.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.500
- WHAT?
- IT'S BIRD BONES!

00:18.533 --> 00:21.367
- I HAVEN'T SEEN TINA
OUT AND ABOUT IN MONTHS.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.033
- GOD, SHE'S EVEN MORE TINIER

00:23.066 --> 00:24.734
AND MORE BIRDLIKE
THAN I REMEMBER.

00:24.767 --> 00:26.400
I CAN'T BELIEVE MARK
MARRIED HER!

00:26.433 --> 00:27.767
- LOOK AT HER HAIR.
NOT A STRAND OUT OF PLACE.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.233
- SHE STILL HAVE THAT THING

00:29.266 --> 00:31.033
WHERE SHE BREAKS HER BONES
ALL THE TIME?

00:31.066 --> 00:32.500
- MM-HMM. YEAH,
BUT SHE'S KEEPIN' IT TIGHT.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.700
- YEAH.
- BODY BE BANGIN'.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.734
- ♪ THEY BE BANGIN' ♪
- SHH.

00:35.767 --> 00:39.266
- RUB YOUR THUMB ON THE KNOB
AND TELL ME WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.333
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

00:40.367 --> 00:42.200
IT FEELS TOO BIG
IN MY SMALL HANDS.

00:42.233 --> 00:44.233
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE GONNA KEEP ON LOOKING

00:44.266 --> 00:47.033
UNTIL WE FIND A KNOB
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD.

00:47.066 --> 00:48.166
ALL RIGHT?

00:48.200 --> 00:49.700
- OKAY. THANKS, HONEY.
- COME HERE. HEY.

00:49.734 --> 00:51.433
- MY GOD, LOOK HOW
SOLICITOUS HE IS.

00:51.467 --> 00:53.266
HE WAS NEVER LIKE THAT
WHEN WE WERE DATING!

00:53.300 --> 00:54.400
- "RUB MY KNOB."
NO, THANK YOU.

00:54.433 --> 00:55.667
- OH! INAPPROPRIATE.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.333
AND WHY IS HE SHOPPING
FOR KNOBS WITH HER ANYWAY?

00:58.367 --> 01:00.033
- MY U.P.S. GUY, ROB ROCKEMOOR,
HE TOLD ME

01:00.066 --> 01:01.367
THAT THEY'VE RENOVATED
THE INSIDE OF THEIR HOUSE

01:01.400 --> 01:02.734
LIKE THREE TIMES.

01:02.767 --> 01:04.500
- ON HIS COP SALARY?
- I KNOW.

01:04.533 --> 01:06.433
- 'CAUSE YOU KNOW SHE'S NOT
WORKIN'--AM I RIGHT?

01:06.467 --> 01:08.100
- AM I RIGHT OR AM I RIGHT?
[loud beep]

01:08.133 --> 01:09.600
- OH!
- OH, MY--SHH!

01:09.633 --> 01:10.734
[beeping]
- STOP IT--I DON'T KNOW--

01:10.767 --> 01:12.200
- EMMA?

01:12.233 --> 01:13.500

01:20.567 --> 01:22.433

01:22.467 --> 01:23.767
- HEY!

01:24.000 --> 01:25.367
- HI, EMMA.
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.767
- MARK SAID THAT
YOU'RE BACK IN TOWN.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.533
- YEP, BACK HOME, YOU KNOW,

01:28.567 --> 01:30.700
JUST HELPING FATTY HERE
PLOP OUT A BABY.

01:30.734 --> 01:32.367

01:34.000 --> 01:37.100

WALKED OUT OF A HOLLYWOOD SALON.

01:37.133 --> 01:39.233
JUST GORGEOUS!

01:39.266 --> 01:40.633
NOT THE TWO OF US--
WE LOOK LIKE

01:40.667 --> 01:43.367
A COUPLE OF SISTER WIVES.
JUST, YOU KNOW, IS IT

01:43.400 --> 01:45.200
HIS TURN OR MY TURN OR...

01:45.233 --> 01:47.333
WE'RE ALL TAKING A TURN,
SO...

01:47.367 --> 01:49.233
ANYHOOS--
- MAYBE WE SHOULD GO.

01:49.266 --> 01:51.200
- YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE SHOULD ALL HANG OUT

01:51.233 --> 01:52.700
SOME TIME.
- OH, I DON'T--I DON'T THINK

01:52.734 --> 01:54.500
WE NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO THAT.

01:54.533 --> 01:57.100
- NO, WE DEFINITELY SHOULD.
IN FACT, I AM NOT LEAVING

01:57.133 --> 01:58.667
UNTIL WE MAKE FIRM PLANS.

01:58.700 --> 01:59.767
- WELL, HOW 'BOUT TOMORROW?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000

02:03.533 --> 02:04.767
WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON THE DOCKET?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.233
- UM, YOU KNOW WHAT,

02:06.266 --> 02:07.467
THAT IS A NICE INVITATION...
- YEAH.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.200
- BUT--
- WELL, THEN WE CAN DO BRUNCH.

02:09.233 --> 02:11.367
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LOVE

02:11.400 --> 02:13.400
TO HAVE YOU IN MY HOME
WHERE I LIVE,

02:13.433 --> 02:15.066
I HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW.
- OH!

02:15.100 --> 02:16.266
- OH...
- SO IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME.

02:16.300 --> 02:20.000
- WELL, GREAT,
THEN IT'S JUST US GIRLS.

02:20.033 --> 02:21.734

LET'S JUST GET BACK IN THE CAR.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.300
WE'LL TELL HER I HAVE
CAPITAL "D."

02:46.333 --> 02:47.700
NO ONE QUESTIONS THAT.
- WHAT? NO.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.700
WE ARE NOT FAKING DIARRHEA,
OKAY?

02:49.734 --> 02:52.233
WE COMMITTED TO THIS BRUNCH.
- YEAH, BUT WHY WOULD BIRD BONES

02:52.266 --> 02:54.500
WANT TO HAVE BRUNCH WITH
HER HUSBAND'S EX-GIRLFRIEND?

02:54.533 --> 02:56.333
THAT'S WEIRD!
- IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

02:56.367 --> 02:58.567
- NO, IT WASN'T.
- YOU SAID, AND I QUOTE,

02:58.600 --> 03:01.433
"I'M NOT LEAVING HERE UNTIL
WE MAKE FIRM PLANS."

03:01.467 --> 03:03.300
- WELL, I MUST HAVE HAD
A PETITE MAL SEIZURE,

03:03.333 --> 03:04.700
'CAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER THAT
AT ALL.

03:04.734 --> 03:06.667
WHAT ARE WE EVEN GONNA
TALK TO HER ABOUT?

03:06.700 --> 03:08.500
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I GOTTA GET MY EYES

03:08.533 --> 03:10.433
ON THE INSIDE OF THIS HOUSE,
'CAUSE ROD SAYS IT'S STUNNING.

03:10.467 --> 03:12.567
- YOU NEED TO STOP HANGING OUT
WITH THE U.P.S. GUY.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.066
- ROD IS AN AMAZING MAN,

03:14.100 --> 03:16.367
AND ALSO, HE KNOWS
HOW TO ROCK A BROWN SHORT.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.600
- LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
NOBODY IS THIS PERFECT.

03:18.633 --> 03:20.300
MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH HER.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.700
- I TELL YOU WHAT,
IF IT GETS TOO WEIRD,

03:21.734 --> 03:24.133
WE'RE JUST GONNA TOSS HER
A BIG OLD BAG OF BIRD SEED,

03:24.166 --> 03:26.300
WATCH HER WORK THE SHELL OFF.

03:26.333 --> 03:27.467
AH-CAH-CAH.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.233
- [screeching]

03:29.266 --> 03:31.333
THAT'S A GOOD ONE, MAG.
OH, MY GOD!

03:31.367 --> 03:32.500
WERE YOU JUST WAITING HERE
FOR US?

03:32.533 --> 03:34.600
- ABSOLUTELY, I WAS.
- ARE WE UNDER ARREST?

03:34.633 --> 03:36.500
- THIS IS SERIOUS--MY WIFE IS
A VERY FRAGILE WOMAN, OKAY?

03:36.533 --> 03:38.600
SHE GOT SO WORKED UP LAST NIGHT
GETTING EVERYTHING READY,

03:38.633 --> 03:40.734
SHE COULD BARELY SLEEP.
- WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST THROW

03:40.767 --> 03:43.266
A BLANKET OVER HER CAGE?
- HEY! HEY!

03:43.300 --> 03:44.467
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.400
- WHAT?
- YOU TWO CAN BE MEAN.

03:46.433 --> 03:47.467
- HEY, NUH-UH!
- WHAT? WE'RE NOT MEAN.

03:47.500 --> 03:48.667
- NO, WE'RE NOT.
- YOU'RE MEAN.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.400
- YOU'RE NICE WHEN
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN,

03:50.433 --> 03:52.333
BUT WHEN YOU TWO GET TOGETHER,
IT'S JUST LIKE HIGH SCHOOL.

03:52.367 --> 03:53.633
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
I'M TALKING ABOUT

03:53.667 --> 03:55.300
GOSSIPY GIRL HELL WHERE
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT--

03:55.333 --> 03:56.567
[yammering]
- OKAY...

03:56.600 --> 03:58.133
PLEASE, CAN YOU PLEASE TALK--

03:58.166 --> 03:59.767
- I HOPE THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE AN IMPRESSION OF US.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.734
- UNFORTUNATELY,
I CANNOT BE HERE

04:01.767 --> 04:04.533
TO LOOK OUT FOR TINA,
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO TO WORK.

04:04.567 --> 04:07.100
SO PLEASE...BE ON
YOUR BEST BEHAVIOR.

04:07.133 --> 04:09.133
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE'RE GONNA DO--ATTACK HER?

04:09.166 --> 04:10.166
IT'S A LADIES' BRUNCH.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.233
- JUST BE NICE.
BE NICE.

04:11.266 --> 04:12.266
- OH, MY GOD!

04:24.200 --> 04:26.633
- TINA, ARE YOU GONNA EAT
ANY OF THIS DELICIOUS FOOD

04:26.667 --> 04:28.133
YOU'VE PREPARED?

04:28.166 --> 04:29.367
- NO.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.500
- OKAY.

04:31.533 --> 04:33.000
- UH, TINA,

04:33.033 --> 04:34.533
THAT IS A GORGEOUS DRESS.

04:34.567 --> 04:36.133
- OH! THANK YOU.

04:36.166 --> 04:37.767
- WHERE'D YOU GET IT?
- MY BIRTHDAY.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.033
- [clears throat]

04:45.533 --> 04:47.233
- THIS IS SO MUCH FUN!
- OH!

04:47.266 --> 04:49.000
SO MUCH FUN!
- IT REALLY IS.

04:49.033 --> 04:51.000
- WE ARE JUST...
- [giggles]

04:51.033 --> 04:53.233
- THIS IS ONE FOR
THE HISTORY BOOKS, FOR SURE.

04:53.266 --> 04:54.500
- [chuckles]

04:56.367 --> 04:58.667
THIS HOUSE IS SPECTACULAR,
TINA.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.033
DO YOU DO ALL THE DECORATING
YOURSELF?

05:01.066 --> 05:02.300
- I DO!
[laughs]

05:02.333 --> 05:03.533
WOULD YOU GUYS
LIKE A TOUR?

05:03.567 --> 05:05.600
- YES, WE WOULD LOVE A TOUR.
- PLEASE. YES.

05:05.633 --> 05:07.266
THERE IS NOTHING I'D LIKE MORE.
- YES, PLEASE.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.400
- FOLLOW ME.
- OKAY.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.433
- WELL, UM...THE KITCHEN IS

05:10.467 --> 05:12.667
LUX-MODERN MEETS NEO-TRADITIONAL

05:12.700 --> 05:16.667
WITH JUST A HINT OF THE WHIMSY
OF GIADA AT HOME.

05:16.700 --> 05:17.667
THE COUNTER TOP--
- WE'RE JUST--

05:17.700 --> 05:19.033
OH, SORRY TO INTERRUPT,

05:19.066 --> 05:21.533
BUT IT'S SO CLEAN
AND PRISTINE IN HERE.

05:21.567 --> 05:23.667
WHERE--WHERE DO YOU KEEP, LIKE,
YOUR JUNK AND STUFF?

05:23.700 --> 05:25.266
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.367
- YOU KNOW, LIKE
YOUR OLD BATTERIES

05:27.400 --> 05:29.300
OR BED BATH & BEYOND COUPONS

05:29.333 --> 05:31.033
OR THOSE KEYS THAT YOU'RE LIKE,
"WHAT IS THIS FOR?"

05:31.066 --> 05:32.767
- OH! MY JUNK.
- YEAH.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.066
- OKAY, NOW, DO NOT JUDGE ME,
PLEASE.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.533
- OH, NO, WE WON'T.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.633
- OH, EMBARRASSING.

05:39.667 --> 05:42.166
- SEE, EMMA, THERE IT IS.
- YEAH.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.233
- LET'S PUT THAT AWAY.
[giggles]

05:43.266 --> 05:44.533
- OOH, WOW.

05:44.567 --> 05:47.066
- NOW, IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME
INTO THE DINING AREA,

05:47.100 --> 05:50.200
I'LL TELL YOU
THE RIVETING ORIGIN STORY

05:50.233 --> 05:52.333
OF MY ANTIQUE DREXEL HERITAGE
CHINA HUTCH.

05:52.367 --> 05:54.600
both: OOH.

05:54.633 --> 05:57.333
- OKAY, SO SEVEN OF YOUR GARDEN
GNOMES HAVE BEEN STOLEN.

05:57.367 --> 05:58.700
IS THAT CORRECT?
- YES.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.033
- AND DO THEY ALL LOOK
LIKE THIS ONE?

06:00.066 --> 06:01.567
- [tersely]
NO, SIR.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.300
EACH GNOME IS UNIQUELY OUTFITTED

06:03.333 --> 06:06.633
ACCORDING TO HIS OR HER SPECIFIC
PERSONALITY OR OCCUPATION.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.367
- WHAT DOES THIS ONE DO?

06:08.400 --> 06:09.533
- FELDSPAR IS A VETERINARIAN.

06:09.567 --> 06:11.066
THAT'S WHY HE HAS
A CAT IN A WHEELBARROW.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.066
- AND WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU
THINK THAT JOFFREY HERE

06:13.100 --> 06:14.333
IS THE ONE THAT STOLE
THE OTHER GNOMES?

06:14.367 --> 06:18.600
- HE EMAILED ME
THESE LEWD PHOTOGRAPHS.

06:18.633 --> 06:20.333
- ARE THESE GNOMES WEARING
EYES WIDE SHUT MASKS?

06:20.367 --> 06:22.667
OH.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.467
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.533
OKAY.

06:26.567 --> 06:29.066
OH, GOSH.

06:29.100 --> 06:30.600
WELL, THAT'S JUST A HUG.

06:30.633 --> 06:32.600
THAT'S JUST A SWEET HUG.

06:32.633 --> 06:34.000
OH, NO, IT'S NOT.

06:34.033 --> 06:35.333
- [chuckles]
- IT'S NOT FUNNY!

06:35.367 --> 06:37.734
GNOMES DON'T HAVE ORGIES.
THEY MATE FOR LIFE,

06:37.767 --> 06:39.133
AND THEY DON'T
HAVE SEX FOR PLEASURE.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.467
- I THINK THAT THIS CASE
IS PRETTY OPEN AND SHUT.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.066
JOFFREY, APOLOGIZE TO MR. CASEY,

06:43.100 --> 06:44.166
AND GIVE HIM BACK HIS GNOMES.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.600
- I DIDN'T DO IT.

06:45.633 --> 06:47.467
- YOU EMAILED HIM THE PICTURES
FROM YOUR OWN EMAIL ADDRESS,

06:47.500 --> 06:50.200
AND IF YOU DON'T CONFESS, I HAVE
TO OPEN A FORMAL INVESTIGATION,

06:50.233 --> 06:51.367
SO PLEASE TELL HIM
WHERE THE GNOMES ARE

06:51.400 --> 06:53.400
SO WE CAN ALL GO HOME.
- I DIDN'T DO IT.

06:53.433 --> 06:55.567
- YES, YOU DID,
YOU LITTLE RAT!

06:55.600 --> 06:57.000
AND I WILL NOT REST

06:57.033 --> 06:59.200
UNTIL HOCUS, POCUS, KLONDIKE,

06:59.233 --> 07:02.266
GUNTHER, SHASTA, EXCELSIOR,
AND CHARLES

07:02.300 --> 07:04.100
ARE RETURNED TO MY CARE

07:04.133 --> 07:05.400
WITHOUT HARM!

07:05.433 --> 07:07.633
- [sighs]

07:07.667 --> 07:09.266
CAN YOU REPEAT THOSE NAMES
FOR THE RECORD?

07:09.300 --> 07:11.433
- HOCUS. A SILLY MAN.
SMOKES A PIPE.

07:11.467 --> 07:12.667
- YEAH.
- POCUS.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.233
- OKAY, SO THAT'S ONE GNOME?

07:14.266 --> 07:16.633
- NO, IT'S TWO GNOMES.
THEY'RE ESTRANGED BROTHERS.

07:16.667 --> 07:19.567
- AND WE CALL THAT
OUR DAISY GREAT GATSBY ROOM.

07:19.600 --> 07:23.100
AND AS WE ENTER
THE MASTER BEDROOM,

07:23.133 --> 07:26.333
YOU'LL NOTICE THAT I'VE DRAWN
INSPIRATION FROM THE FAR EAST.

IT'S A VERITABLE PU-PU PLATTER
OF INFLUENCES

07:29.166 --> 07:30.767
FROM MANY ASIAN CULTURES.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.734

HIS SLOPPY JOES,

07:32.767 --> 07:34.400
BUT THERE IS NO WAY
YOU'RE LETTING HIM EAT THOSE

08:03.700 --> 08:06.600
HONESTLY, I WOULD MURDER
LIKE 1,000 HOBOS

08:06.633 --> 08:08.200

THE END OF OUR TOUR.

08:10.033 --> 08:11.767

WE'VE WASTED HALF A DAY
TALKING ABOUT THESE GNOMES.

I'M LASHING OUT

11:57.166 --> 11:58.567

15:09.734 --> 15:11.000
- JOFFREY, HOLD UP!

15:11.033 --> 15:13.300
- [screams]
- OH, MY GOD!

15:13.333 --> 15:14.767
WHAT THE HELL?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.500
- PREGNANCY STRENGTH.

15:16.533 --> 15:18.100
[clicks tongue]

15:18.133 --> 15:19.467
- EMMA, WHERE IS TINA?

15:19.500 --> 15:20.467
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.367
THANKS SO MUCH, BYE-BYE.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.000
- LEAVE ME.
SAVE THE GNOMES.

15:25.033 --> 15:26.467
- I WON'T LEAVE YOU.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.300
- OKAY?
- MY GNOMES!

15:28.333 --> 15:30.700
[wheezing] GNOMES.
- GNOMES, SAVE THE GNOMES.

15:30.734 --> 15:32.000
- HOCUS-POCUS
DOESN'T LIKE GUNTHER.

15:32.033 --> 15:33.166
KEEP THEM SEPARATE.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.266
I'VE GOT HIS FACE
FACED THE OTHER WAY

15:34.300 --> 15:35.266
SO HE DOESN'T HAVE
TO LOOK AT 'EM.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.467
- THEY'RE GONNA HATE THAT.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.500
- OKAY, ON THE DRIVING RANGE,
STOP THE BALLS!

15:40.734 --> 15:43.367
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE?

15:43.400 --> 15:46.500
- [muffled crying]
- TINA?

15:46.533 --> 15:50.367
- TINA...

15:50.400 --> 15:51.367
- WHOA.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.166
- [sniffling]

15:54.200 --> 15:55.500
- THIS WAS NOT ON THE TOUR.

15:57.433 --> 15:59.500
- [choked sobs]

16:07.633 --> 16:09.400
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANTED?

16:09.433 --> 16:12.400
HERE'S EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG
WITH ME, ALL IN ONE CLOSET!

16:12.433 --> 16:14.000
- TINA, WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF?

16:14.033 --> 16:15.467
- IT'S FROM QVC!

16:15.500 --> 16:21.000
I HAVE EVERYTHING THAT QVC SELLS
FROM 1996 TO THE PRESENT DAY.

16:21.033 --> 16:24.033
I HAVE 25 PANINI PRESSES.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.066
I DON'T EVEN LIKE
HOT SANDWICHES.

16:26.100 --> 16:28.367
- TINA, WHY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.467
I WAS JUST SO LONELY
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.633
THEN I STARTED CALLING IN,

16:33.667 --> 16:35.533
AND THE OPERATORS
WERE SO FRIENDLY.

16:35.567 --> 16:37.233
THEY WERE SO NICE.

16:37.266 --> 16:39.367
ONE OF THEM IS NAMED YOLANDA.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.700
YOLANDA'S MY BEST FRIEND.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.367
- NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- DON'T SAY THAT.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.700
- YOU DON'T CARE.

16:44.734 --> 16:47.734
YOU THINK THAT I DIDN'T NOTICE
ALL YOUR POINTED QUESTIONS?

16:47.767 --> 16:49.367
I'M NOT STUPID.

16:49.400 --> 16:53.166
YOU WANTED TO KNOW HOW MARK
COULD BE WITH A FREAK LIKE ME.

16:54.633 --> 16:56.467
- OKAY, TINA, YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:56.500 --> 17:00.200
I CAME HERE HOPING TO
FIND SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU.

17:00.233 --> 17:02.467
BECAUSE...
[sighs]

17:02.500 --> 17:03.533
I'M JEALOUS OF YOU.

17:03.567 --> 17:06.100
- WHAT?
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

17:06.133 --> 17:09.567
- IT'S TRUE, WE ARE.
SHE IS. I AM.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.633
- YEAH, YOU'RE MARRIED TO
MY HIGH SCHOOL BOYFRIEND.

17:11.667 --> 17:15.233
YOU HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL LIFE
AND THIS DREAM HOUSE.

17:15.266 --> 17:19.066
AND ALSO, P.S.,
YOUR BODY BE BANGIN'.

17:19.100 --> 17:21.200
- REALLY?

17:21.233 --> 17:23.467
YOU THINK MY BODY BE BANGIN'?
- YES!

17:23.500 --> 17:25.667
'CAUSE IT DOES!

17:25.700 --> 17:27.033
IT DOES BE BANGIN'.

17:27.066 --> 17:28.600
- AND THE ONLY THING
WE COULD THINK

17:28.633 --> 17:29.667
THAT WAS WRONG WITH YOU

17:29.700 --> 17:31.166
WAS YOUR WEAK BONES.
- YEAH.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.400
- AND THAT'S NOT EVEN
YOUR FAULT.

17:32.433 --> 17:33.600
- NO, THAT'S GENETICS.

17:33.633 --> 17:36.133
- YEAH, OR LACK OF DAIRY.
DO YOU DRINK MILK?

17:36.166 --> 17:38.567
- SO, TINA, THIS CLOSET,

17:38.600 --> 17:41.433
FINDING OUT THERE'S SOMETHING
NOT-SO-PERFECT ABOUT YOU,

17:41.467 --> 17:44.133
HONESTLY? THAT'S GIVING ME BACK
MY WILL TO LIVE.

17:44.166 --> 17:47.200
- DON'T WORRY.
I AM NOT PERFECT.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.433
I'M NOT PERFECT AT ALL.

17:50.467 --> 17:52.567
- HEY, MAYBE WE SHOULD
S-SLOW DOWN ON THOSE,

17:52.600 --> 17:54.633
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T GET ANYMORE
TILL EASTER.

17:54.667 --> 17:56.533
- WELL, THEY COME OUT AGAIN
AT HALLOWEEN.

17:56.567 --> 17:59.133
- CADBURY CREME EGGS?
- CADBURY SCREME EGGS.

17:59.166 --> 18:01.567
- MM.
- YEAH, SHE KNOWS.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.033
- I DON'T WANNA DO IT ANYMORE.

18:03.066 --> 18:06.467
I JUST--
I CAN'T STOP BUYING THINGS.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.033
- HEY, I DON'T MEAN TO BRAG,
BUT BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,

18:09.066 --> 18:11.600
WE HAVE SEEN A TON OF HGTV.
- OH, YEAH.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.133
AND, LIKE, MORE OPRAH
HOARDING SPECIALS

18:13.166 --> 18:14.400
THAN YOU CAN SHAKE A STICK AT.

18:14.433 --> 18:16.467
- YEAH, YOU KNOW HER
ORGANIZING GUY, PETER WALSH?

18:16.500 --> 18:18.500
- MM, THE AUSTRALIAN.
- WE'RE OBSESSED WITH HIM.

18:18.533 --> 18:21.066
IF YOU WANTED, WE COULD CLEAN
THIS CLOSET UP IN NO TIME.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.300
- REALLY?
both: YEAH.

18:22.333 --> 18:24.567
- AND MAYBE NEXT TIME
YOU WANNA BUY SOMETHING,

18:24.600 --> 18:26.700
YOU CALL US UP INSTEAD.

18:26.734 --> 18:27.700
- OKAY.

18:27.734 --> 18:30.000
- MAGGIE?
- YEAH?

18:30.033 --> 18:32.233
- [Australian accent]
GO GET THE GARBAGE BAGS.

18:32.266 --> 18:34.166
- [Australian accent]
OH. START THINKING ABOUT

18:34.200 --> 18:36.200
WHAT YOU WANT TO GIVE AWAY.

18:36.233 --> 18:37.767
- THAT BOY SAVED MY LIFE.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.200
- ALL RIGHT.
- AND THE LIVES OF MY GNOMES.

18:40.233 --> 18:41.500
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
I SAVED THE GNOMES.

18:41.533 --> 18:42.767
- HISTORY WILL DECIDE.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.266
- IT ALREADY HAS.

18:44.300 --> 18:47.333
SO, UH, JOFFREY, BUDDY, THANKS.
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

18:47.367 --> 18:48.567
- YEAH, I KNOW.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.000
- MR. CASEY, CAN WE CONSIDER
THIS CASE CLOSED?

18:51.033 --> 18:52.533
THERE ARE CURRENTLY
TWO WOMEN IN MY HOME

18:52.567 --> 18:55.300
WHO MAY BE MURDERING MY WIFE,
SO I NEED TO GO.

18:55.333 --> 18:56.467
- THERE IS JUST ONE MORE THING.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.734
IN GRATITUDE FOR YOUR BRAVERY...
- MM-HMM.

18:59.767 --> 19:02.066
- AND YOUR COMMITMENT
TO JUSTICE,

19:02.100 --> 19:04.333
I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU BOTH
A GNOME.

19:04.367 --> 19:05.467
- YOU REALLY DON'T NEED
TO DO THAT.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.600
- I INSIST.
- OKAY, THEN.

19:07.633 --> 19:08.734
I WILL TAKE THIS ONE
WITH THE WEIRD PIPE.

19:08.767 --> 19:10.500
- [laughs]
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, JOFFREY?

19:10.533 --> 19:12.133
WHICH ONE DO YOU--
NO, JOFF--WHAT?

19:12.166 --> 19:14.066
- SEE YA!
- YOU'RE STEALING A GOLF CART?

19:14.100 --> 19:18.200
YOU'RE BEING A FULL-BLOWN BOZO!

19:18.233 --> 19:19.667
- [screaming]
- NO, NO...DON'T...

19:19.700 --> 19:21.467
- EXCELSIOR!

19:21.500 --> 19:22.467
NO!
- I'M SORRY.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.233
I'M--
- HIS LITTLE HEAD!

19:24.266 --> 19:27.767
WHY?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.667
- ALL RIGHT.
- TINA, ARE YOU COMFORTABLE?

19:29.700 --> 19:31.166
- UH...
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

19:31.200 --> 19:32.433
- YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE A WHILE.
DO YOU NEED A WATER?

19:32.467 --> 19:33.467
- OKAY, LET'S JUST DO IT.
LET'S JUST DO IT.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.433
- TINA, DO YOU FEEL
LIKE A CHAMPION?

19:34.467 --> 19:36.100
- [sighs]
I'M A CHAMPION.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.533
- OKAY, SHE'S A CHAMPION.
ALL RIGHT.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.467
NOW, HERE ARE THE RULES.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.433
WE ARE GONNA SORT
EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT

19:41.467 --> 19:42.633
INTO THREE PILES.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.500
- TOSS, KEEP, AND GIVE AWAY.

19:44.533 --> 19:47.133
AND ALL THAT'S LEFT TO DO
IS CHOOSE WHAT TO START WITH.

19:47.166 --> 19:49.467
SO WHY DON'T WE START WITH
THESE OMELETTE MAKERS?

19:49.500 --> 19:53.667
- OH, OKAY, YOU'VE GOT ABOUT
20 MICROWAVE OMELETTE MAKERS.

19:53.700 --> 19:54.767
HOW MANY DO YOU
WANT TO GET RID OF?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.700
- 1.
- 1?

19:56.734 --> 19:58.500
- KEEP 19.
- NO, NO, NO.

19:58.533 --> 20:00.367
TINA, YOU KNOW HOW THIS WORKS.
- KEEP 19.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.533
- STOP SAYING THAT.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS WORKS.

20:02.567 --> 20:04.500
WE ARE ONLY KEEPING 1.

20:04.533 --> 20:06.000
- DO YOU WANNA
GIVE THE REST AWAY?

20:06.033 --> 20:07.433
- NO, TOSS 'EM.
IF I CAN'T HAVE THEM,

20:07.467 --> 20:08.533
I DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE
TO HAVE THEM.

20:08.567 --> 20:10.133
- TINA!
- THAT'S RUDE.

20:10.166 --> 20:11.367
[chuckles]
- TINA...I GOTTA TELL YOU,

20:11.400 --> 20:12.700
I'M LIKING YOU MORE AND MORE

20:12.734 --> 20:14.100
WITH ALL THESE RUDE THINGS
COMING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

20:14.133 --> 20:15.467
- OH, WOW, LOOK AT
ALL THESE TEDDY BEARS.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.000
- OH, SEE, THIS IS ENTIRELY
TOO MANY TEDDY BEARS--

20:18.033 --> 20:19.166
- NO. NOT MY GUNDS.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.734
I GOTTA HAVE MY GUNDS!
- OH, TINA--

20:20.767 --> 20:21.734
- NO!
[all screaming]

20:21.767 --> 20:24.033
- TINA!
- OH, NO!

20:24.066 --> 20:25.734
- OH, I'M HURT, OW!

20:25.767 --> 20:27.533
[groans]
- OH, COME ON.

20:27.567 --> 20:29.066
IT'S JUST A BUNCH
OF STUFFED ANIMALS.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.633
- ONE OF
THEIR HARD PLASTIC NOSES

20:30.667 --> 20:32.266
HIT A TINY BONE IN MY WRIST.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.734
- UGH, ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA GO GET THE SPLINTS.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.767
- FROM THE BIG JAR.
OW.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.433
- YOU WANNA NIBBLE ON THIS,
SISTER?

20:42.767 --> 20:45.200
OW! HEY, NOW.
- SORRY.

20:52.066 --> 20:53.633
- LIKE A CLEAN SLATE.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:53.667 --> 20:55.633
- HEY, HOW IS SHE?
- SHE'S GREAT.

20:55.667 --> 20:57.066
WE GOT HER PROPPED UP
IN THE BED.

20:57.100 --> 20:58.333
SHE'S WATCHING HGTV.

20:58.367 --> 20:59.400
- OH, YEAH.
- CAN I JUST ASK,

20:59.433 --> 21:00.734
WHAT HAPPENED HERE TODAY?

21:00.767 --> 21:02.166
- NOTHING.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.734
- JUST A TYPICAL
LADIES BRUNCH.

21:03.767 --> 21:05.033
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU DID,

21:05.066 --> 21:06.734
BUT YOU TWO CONVINCED TINA
TO SHOW YOU

21:06.767 --> 21:08.433
HER SECRET HOARDER'S CLOSET.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.600
I MEAN, NO ONE'S EVER SEEN THAT.
- OH, IT WAS NO BIGGIE.

21:10.633 --> 21:12.066
WE JUST WERE HELPING HER
CLEAN IT OUT.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.233
- YEAH.
- REALLY?

21:13.266 --> 21:14.266
AND SHE WAS JUST
PERFECTLY OKAY WITH THAT?

21:14.300 --> 21:15.567
both: UH-HUH.
- AND RIGHT NOW,

21:15.600 --> 21:17.033
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE
ANY COMMENTS

21:17.066 --> 21:18.266
ABOUT SHE TRIED TO PECK
YOUR EYES OUT OR ANYTHING?

21:18.300 --> 21:20.567
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT,
TINA'S PRETTY GREAT.

21:20.600 --> 21:21.600
- MM-HMM.

21:21.633 --> 21:23.433
- I TOTALLY GET
WHY YOU'RE TOGETHER.

21:23.467 --> 21:25.633
- WHY ARE YOU TWO BEING SO NICE
TO ME RIGHT NOW?

21:25.667 --> 21:27.333
- [chuckles]
- I FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

21:27.367 --> 21:30.133
PLEASE MAKE A SNIDE COMMENT
ABOUT MY LIFE.

21:30.166 --> 21:31.500
- I WON'T.
I WON'T DO IT.

21:31.533 --> 21:34.467
MAGS, OUR WORK HERE IS DONE.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.333
- OKAY, UH, WAIT, GUYS.
- TAKE CARE, BUDDY.

21:36.367 --> 21:38.400
- GUYS? WHY ARE YOU WEARING
OUR BATHROBES?

21:38.433 --> 21:40.066
- BYE NOW.
- IT'S A NICE WEAVE

21:40.100 --> 21:41.467
IS WHAT IT IS, YEAH.
- IT IS A GOOD WEAVE.

21:41.500 --> 21:44.066
- GIVE ME BACK OUR ROBES!

21:44.100 --> 21:46.233
both: BYE!

21:46.266 --> 21:48.033
[laughter]

21:48.066 --> 21:49.734
- I FEEL LIKE
THE MARY POPPINS OF TRASH.
