WEBVTT

00:01.836 --> 00:03.836
(knocking at door)

00:03.971 --> 00:06.772
(music playing softly)

00:06.841 --> 00:09.308
(english accent) what tidings
hath you, my good messenger?

00:09.443 --> 00:10.843
Sorry, wrong apartment.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.311
Nope, I ordered the pizza.

00:12.446 --> 00:13.846
I was just doing
a little role play.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.314
Yeah, we're not that kind
of service.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.849
No, thanks, I know.

00:20.387 --> 00:21.719
'kay. Have a good one.

00:21.756 --> 00:22.921
You too, ma'am.

00:22.923 --> 00:25.256
Uh, wait,
did you just call me ma'am?

00:25.292 --> 00:26.792
Yeah, it's in our manual.

00:26.927 --> 00:29.928
Anyone over a certain age gets
a "sir" or a "ma'am."

00:29.997 --> 00:31.463
Okay, on the one hand, I get it.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.398
To you, I must seem pretty
worldly.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.801
I mean, what are you, 20? 21?

00:35.870 --> 00:37.069
17.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.671
Come on, who is 17 anymore?
Well--

00:39.673 --> 00:41.373
When I was your age,
I thought 30 was old too,

00:41.442 --> 00:44.343
But you know what they say,
30 is the new 20.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.478
And I'm 31,
which is basically 21,

00:46.480 --> 00:47.880
Which is almost as old as you--

00:48.015 --> 00:49.280
Uh, I should get going, ma'am--

00:49.316 --> 00:50.815
Say it again. I dare you!

00:52.319 --> 00:55.620
I am so sorry.
It has been a day.

00:55.689 --> 00:56.955
Here's 20.

00:56.957 --> 00:59.825
And let's just forget
this whole thing.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.192
Oh, wow.

01:01.228 --> 01:04.396
Wait, so the purple is a 10 and
the blues are fives, right?

01:04.398 --> 01:06.398
Actually, there's an app that
you could just--

01:06.400 --> 01:07.832
Delivery guy:
Enjoy your mega-meatza!

01:07.868 --> 01:09.301
I'm taking some for lunch!

01:09.303 --> 01:12.104

01:12.239 --> 01:15.507

01:25.452 --> 01:27.452
I'll let you know when
the whitefish puree comes in.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.521
See ya.
Thanks, deb.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.658
(clattering)

01:35.496 --> 01:37.796
So another great week
for adoptions!

01:37.798 --> 01:41.733
Sheldon found a sweet home with
a family in ajax. Yay, sheldon!

01:41.735 --> 01:44.202
Is that that perv budgie
who mated with his daughter?

01:44.271 --> 01:46.672
They were close,
and it's not uncommon,

01:46.674 --> 01:48.807
But yes, he mated with his
daughters.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.375
Plural?
I, for one,

01:50.377 --> 01:52.678
Am thrilled to see him gone.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.413
Hey, joy toy, can we skip
the screen time

01:54.548 --> 01:55.781
During morning meeting?

01:55.916 --> 01:59.084
Uh, yeah, of course.
I wasn't. Good morning.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.285
Also, as deb mentioned,

02:00.321 --> 02:02.420
We're running low
on whitefish cat purée,

02:02.456 --> 02:03.688
So please don't
overfill the bowls.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.224
Deb's not back 'til Thursday.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.025
Better pick up the leashes
and toys--

02:07.094 --> 02:08.627
Make way for grizzly feet.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.762
(laughing)

02:10.798 --> 02:12.430
I-I don't know
what you're implying,

02:12.466 --> 02:14.299
But I'm not a fan of
name-calling.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.434
You call me k-dawg.

02:15.569 --> 02:16.635
And you just called me joy toy.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.036
Oh, so now you're paying
attention?

02:18.172 --> 02:19.471
I'm okay with nicknames.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.439
Name-calling was a rite of
passage when I was--

02:21.475 --> 02:24.709
In jail? Tell one story that
isn't about jail, paul.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.379
Actually, I was
on a basketball team.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.248
Nikki:
A basketball team in...

02:29.250 --> 02:30.782
Yeah, jail, okay?

02:30.784 --> 02:32.584
Man on speakerphone:
<i>Thank you so much for holding--</i>

02:32.620 --> 02:34.385
Uh, and other times,
you've called me, uh,

02:34.421 --> 02:35.921
Joy de vivre, ode to joy,

02:35.923 --> 02:38.123
Joy to the world,
comfort and joy, and--

02:38.125 --> 02:40.458
But those are friendly names
because we're friends.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.594
What nikki said
could be hurtful.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.962
You know what else is hurtful?

02:43.964 --> 02:46.064
Getting stepped on
by deb's big boats.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.933
(laughing)

02:48.002 --> 02:49.668
Yeah, I borrowed her skates
last year

02:49.737 --> 02:51.336
And I had to wear my shoes
inside them.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.871
Well, youse guys
all got small feet.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.206
Paul!
What?

02:54.341 --> 02:56.174
Petite feet run
in her family.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.743
My best to choon-hee,
by the way.

02:57.878 --> 03:01.146
Okay, I'm just saying if deb
was still here, would you say,

03:01.281 --> 03:02.814
"hey there, bigfoot?"

03:02.949 --> 03:04.550
Shannon's right,
her feet are big.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.184
No, I-I never said that.

03:06.319 --> 03:07.920
You don't agree
deb has huge hooves?

03:08.055 --> 03:10.822
Deb's feet are not for me,
or anyone else, to comment on.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.091
It's a fact.
Like max is gangly.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.393
No, you can't say that.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.295
What about
"joy has straight hair"?

03:16.430 --> 03:17.529
Well...

03:17.598 --> 03:19.298
It's true.
Straight asian hair.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.433
Oh my god.
Okay, please, none of that.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.168
Listen, I don't want to be
the bad cop,

03:23.170 --> 03:25.637
But we have to open our eyes
to the harm we're doing,

03:25.639 --> 03:27.438
And I am putting my foot down.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.140
Better your foot than deb's.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.175
(laughing)

03:33.047 --> 03:34.379
♪ oh-oh-oh ♪

03:34.514 --> 03:36.782
♪ anything is possible ♪

03:36.917 --> 03:38.383
♪ when you're chasing
the sun ♪

03:38.518 --> 03:40.585
A girl just had a complete
meltdown

03:40.588 --> 03:42.120
Because I gave her dog
a needle.

03:42.156 --> 03:44.656
It took everything I had not to
stick her with it.

03:44.692 --> 03:47.592
I know that's wrong.
Oh, sorry.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.595
(whispering) it's okay.
I'm on hold with mix86!

03:50.664 --> 03:53.398
I don't really listen to top 40.
More of a jazz fan.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.934
Yeah, I don't think they make
that anymore.

03:56.003 --> 03:59.204
And jamal and marcy
are so funny in the mornings.

03:59.273 --> 04:02.274
(pop music playing on phone)

04:02.343 --> 04:04.009
What are you on hold for?

04:04.078 --> 04:06.678
I'm trying to win a trip for
a caribbean singles' cruise.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.480
I was on hold all through the
staff meeting,

04:08.482 --> 04:09.481
But no one noticed.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.682
Lara:
Seriously?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.550
Yeah.
Shannon's a bit naive.

04:12.552 --> 04:15.120
No, I mean about the cruise.
Open-water nightmare.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.155
Um, not this one!
It's for singles

04:17.224 --> 04:20.091
Who enjoy two-and-a-half star
dining and karaoke.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.327
Like maybe my soulmate?

04:22.462 --> 04:23.928
Sure.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.298
Ooh! And get this,
there's aquafit with dolphins.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.965
And an actual nightclub
on board.

04:28.002 --> 04:30.502
Plus, the cruise operates
under maritime law,

04:30.504 --> 04:31.636
So anything can happen.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.705
Pirates could take over
the ship and--

04:33.840 --> 04:36.574
Oh, my gosh!
What if my soulmate is a pirate?

04:36.576 --> 04:38.376
Aww, so romantic.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.446
I prefer trips
with a bit more culture.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.048
When I was 23,
I toured all over europe.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.583
Sounds terrifying.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.285
Canals, cobblestones,

04:47.321 --> 04:49.655
The architecture--
that's romantic.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.123
Yeah, buildings don't sound
romantic.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.159
No. The romantic era.

04:54.161 --> 04:56.127
Oh, my gosh,
I had way too much coffee.

04:56.196 --> 04:59.130
I can't be that person who
answers jamal in the bathroom.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.132
Would you mind?
Oh.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.101
I'll be so quick.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.403
Sure.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.343
(phone vibrating)
oh! Um, joy?

05:11.478 --> 05:13.277
The phone is ringing.

05:13.314 --> 05:16.414
Joy:
Is it jamal? Just answer it!

05:16.450 --> 05:17.615
Hello?

05:17.651 --> 05:19.084
Joy:
What did they say?

05:19.086 --> 05:20.185
They hung up.

05:20.187 --> 05:21.553
Joy:
Am I still on hold?

05:21.555 --> 05:22.688
I think so.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.323
Jamal:
<i> Hello, this is jamal,</i>

05:24.458 --> 05:25.624
<i> And you're on the air</i>
<i> with mix86.</i>

05:25.626 --> 05:26.825
Joy:
Oh my god!

05:26.960 --> 05:28.827
Jamal, I'm not in the bathroom,
I'm here!

05:28.962 --> 05:30.128
<i> You ready--</i>

05:30.197 --> 05:31.363
(shrieking)

05:31.432 --> 05:33.632
Jamal? Jamal?!

05:34.568 --> 05:36.101
What did you do?

05:36.236 --> 05:37.602
Sorry.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.238
Fergus! What brings you by?

05:40.240 --> 05:42.841
Uh, you.
Oh, wow!

05:42.843 --> 05:45.777
I guess I could take a break
if you wanted to hang, or--

05:45.912 --> 05:47.846
Hand me the goods, fergie.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.515
Right! Takeout Tuesday. Duh.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.117
Small order this week.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.719
Did you not get everyone's order
before you called?

05:54.788 --> 05:56.855
It was all so complicated!
"I'm allergic to tempeh."

05:56.857 --> 05:58.256
"hold the pine nuts."
blah, blah.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.925
I did fergie a favour.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.427
Well, maybe a thank you for
fergus.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.929
More like "you're welcome."

06:04.998 --> 06:06.197
I tried.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.933
Uh, I have a buffalo wrap
from a catering job.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.135
It's a few hours old,
but yours if you want.

06:11.171 --> 06:14.806
God, thank you!
I'm running on stress fumes.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.007
Rough day?

06:16.076 --> 06:18.676
Just staff stuff.
But you probably get it.

06:18.678 --> 06:21.279
You seem very chill
managing a bar and nikki.

06:21.281 --> 06:23.882
We mostly work around her.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.552
But I believe that change
starts with u.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.521
Right. And I am trying my best--

06:29.656 --> 06:32.223
No, I mean "u" as in
understanding.

06:32.292 --> 06:36.161
It's all part of a healthy
workplace, or undies.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.628
Uh, what?

06:37.664 --> 06:39.764
Understanding non-derogatory
intentions

06:39.767 --> 06:41.299
In an equitable society.

06:41.435 --> 06:42.634
Wow. That's good.

06:42.769 --> 06:44.069
I'm always happy to offer
my services.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.838
Thanks, we are very
snack-motivated around here.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.707
No, I mean, uh,
as a workshop leader.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.642
I actually have a masters
in mediation.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.710
I'm trained in anti-oppression,

06:52.780 --> 06:54.712
Privilege awareness,
gender bias.

06:54.714 --> 06:56.381
Wow, that's ah-mah-zing.

06:56.450 --> 06:57.782
Here is my card.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.419
My rate is competitive,
and I offer a discount.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.020
Aww, for friends?

07:02.155 --> 07:05.089
No, um, groups.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.124
I have a group rate.
(clearing throat)

07:07.161 --> 07:08.727
And you should probably
eat that soon.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.328
It's not getting any younger.

07:10.330 --> 07:13.731
Don't I know it. Not the
"not getting any younger part."

07:13.801 --> 07:16.134
I mean, I'm not. But...

07:16.269 --> 07:17.669
No, on it.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.737
Eating it.
Yeah.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.607
♪ go on and take off
(on and take off) ♪

07:22.643 --> 07:24.742
♪ take off now, yeah ♪

07:24.778 --> 07:28.646
Joy, I wanted to apologize again
for what happened earlier.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.582
It's okay, it's just a contest.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.450
It's not going to change
anyone's life.

07:32.519 --> 07:35.420
Except the next caller
who got through.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.088
Joy, anger is stored
in the liver.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.557
And a compromised liver can lead
to jaundice and chronic fatigue.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.426
I don't want that
to happen to you.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.828
I guess you can buy me a drink.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.298
Tomorrow is, um, two-for-one
highballs at moxie's

07:46.433 --> 07:47.832
And I know one of the bar-backs.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.568
He gave me a napkin
for my gum once.

07:49.703 --> 07:53.705
Yeah, I don't really do moxie's,
but what about this? Joy, sit.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.840
What if, instead of a cruise,

07:55.876 --> 07:58.443
I could get you to europe?

07:58.578 --> 08:00.845
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.048
But I can't
really afford that.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.448
You can use my points.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.918
You get a trip and I maintain
my silver elite status.

08:07.053 --> 08:09.654
It will basically get you
to dusseldorf for free.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.056
Um, you know,
that sounds like--

08:11.058 --> 08:12.524
Honestly, babe,
don't mention it.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.592
But you're welcome.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.259
Babe?

08:15.295 --> 08:16.928
I'm just gonna text
my friend in frankfurt.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.264
He used to be a drug dealer,
now he runs a gasthaus.

08:19.333 --> 08:23.001
The two aren't mutually
exclusive, but do you do drugs?

08:23.136 --> 08:24.135
Ah, no.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.871
That's fine.
It's a very nice gasthaus.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.739
And what's the biggest
backpack that you own?

08:27.741 --> 08:29.140
Uh...

08:31.512 --> 08:33.345
I have a 70-litre
you can borrow.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.546
For what?
Backpacking.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.081
I have a suitcase.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.949
Don't be a conformist.
I have to carry everything?

08:38.018 --> 08:40.552
It's great cardio.
Oh and book this train ticket.

08:40.554 --> 08:41.819
What train ticket?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.488
To get you to the airport
in geneva.

08:43.623 --> 08:45.489
It's only $50.
Joy, hit confirm.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.158
It says it wants
my credit card.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.628
But they don't charge you for
the first 24 hours. Hit confirm.

08:49.763 --> 08:50.829
(beeping)

08:50.964 --> 08:52.363
Oh, it says it's charging me.

08:52.399 --> 08:53.631
And you're going to europe.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.366
I'm so glad we dealt with this.

08:56.770 --> 09:00.171
Uh, yeah,
it's definitely charging me.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.974
Shannon:
So, I'll check in on
the faulty cat carriers.

09:03.010 --> 09:06.444
Oh, and I know we low-key hate
them, but pet bargain asked

09:06.446 --> 09:08.780
If we can link to
their pet pics with santa event.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.315
Yeah, heard they got a gay santa
this year.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.984
Calls himself "santay."
people are very excited.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.519
Sounds progressive. I'm actually
a little bit worried

09:15.556 --> 09:17.121
About the work culture here.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.390
Look, the exit signs have to be
in english and french.

09:19.426 --> 09:20.992
No. It's not that.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.061
I just think the staff here is
a little bit behind the times.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.529
You can't expect much.
You know what we pay them.

09:25.566 --> 09:26.798
I just mean,
it's a new world.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.199
We might need to enlighten
the staff

09:28.268 --> 09:30.735
With some
big-city perspective.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.538
You know hamilton's a city,
right? A big one.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.239
Of course, but you can't
ignore the fact

09:35.275 --> 09:38.743
That some of the people here are
a little bit out of touch.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.078
I am not gonna name names.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.146
Paul?
All of them! Anyway.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.216
I know this guy.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.818
He's really great,
very sensitive.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.285
I could ask him to do
a pro-inclusion,

09:48.322 --> 09:50.555
Anti-stereotype,
non-defamatory workshop.

09:50.557 --> 09:51.889
What does that even mean?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.191
See? We all have so much
to learn.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.459
Is he legit?

09:54.594 --> 09:57.762
Well, obviously his credentials
are very impressive.

09:57.897 --> 10:01.032
I believe he said
that he mastered meditation?

10:01.068 --> 10:01.799
Uh-huh.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.101
Okay, I didn't catch
all of it,

10:03.103 --> 10:04.703
But obviously he knows what
he's talking about.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.338
He is the founder
of undies.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.807
That doesn't sound true.
Okay, I'm not saying this right,

10:08.942 --> 10:10.175
But trust me,
we need this guy badly.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.710
Well, I think we're doing
fine as is.

10:11.712 --> 10:14.112
I mean, if you want to put up
some anti-bullying posters,

10:14.247 --> 10:17.381
Great, but let's not
overthink this.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.250
Ooh! Or we could even institute
theme days,

10:19.252 --> 10:22.120
Like "we wednesdays"
or" suffrage saturdays?"

10:22.189 --> 10:25.222
Sometimes more is too much.

10:26.593 --> 10:35.066
♪

10:35.135 --> 10:37.802
Hmm... "bullying is whack.
Get on the right track."

10:37.804 --> 10:38.836
Mm-hm.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.605
"it's all right to be polite."
aww.

10:40.607 --> 10:43.741
Just some good reminders,
guidelines for growth,

10:43.777 --> 10:46.277
Printed by moi,
growth enthusiast.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.344
I hear that.

10:47.381 --> 10:49.681
Time to grow up
and stop being a baby

10:49.750 --> 10:51.482
Because babies don't have
soulmates.

10:51.518 --> 10:52.817
What?
Or do they?

10:52.819 --> 10:54.552
Joy, did someone call you
a baby?

10:54.687 --> 10:55.753
Not exactly.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.522
Because that's not okay.
You can tell me.

10:57.524 --> 11:00.925
It's nothing. It's just lara's
planning a trip for me--

11:00.927 --> 11:02.127
Oh no.
I know.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.628
It sounds terrible.
What is wrong with you?

11:04.665 --> 11:06.498
You're right. I am a baby.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.099
(laughing)

11:08.168 --> 11:11.035
Honestly, deb is a human being.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.904
Yes, she has hogs for dogs,

11:12.906 --> 11:14.572
But you're a beautiful soul
and monster feet

11:14.608 --> 11:16.307
Can never take that away!

11:16.376 --> 11:17.508
(laughing stops)

11:17.577 --> 11:19.243
Whoa.
Anyway,

11:19.245 --> 11:21.212
That's what my partner, jen,
looks like

11:21.281 --> 11:24.648
After synchro practice.
Jen gets jelly legs.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.284
Ah.
Jelly legs jen,
I call her.

11:27.320 --> 11:31.055
Love synchronized swimming.
Dance of the water.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.723
Does jen compete, or--

11:32.759 --> 11:34.125
I'll leave the invoices
on your desk

11:34.260 --> 11:38.396
If my monster feet don't
get in the way.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.530
Paul:
Whoa!

11:40.701 --> 11:42.533
No judgment if they do.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.872
I saw something.
Who do I say it to?

11:52.479 --> 11:54.245
It was a misunderstanding.
Yvette from the board

11:54.247 --> 11:56.013
Keeps calling. Apparently,
she's friends with deb

11:56.083 --> 11:58.149
And says her partner
is a wonderful swimmer.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.518
I didn't know that deb
was telling a story.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.253
Well, now the board thinks
we need a seminar

12:02.255 --> 12:05.623
For the staff
that they insist I oversee.

12:05.659 --> 12:07.692
What's the name of your
anti-dictatorship guy?

12:07.827 --> 12:10.895
Fergus? Pfft.
He doesn't need to know.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.631
I mean, why bring him in
when I have you?

12:13.633 --> 12:14.632
Sorry?

12:14.768 --> 12:16.367
Who better than you

12:16.369 --> 12:18.569
To teach me about inclusion
and unconscious... Bias?

12:18.571 --> 12:19.871
And why's that?

12:20.006 --> 12:22.573
Because you're you,
and I'm me and--

12:22.609 --> 12:24.408
And you have seen things

12:24.478 --> 12:27.278
And you've heard things
because you're...

12:27.280 --> 12:28.613
Mm-hm?

12:28.682 --> 12:30.681
I'm reading a book
about power and privilege,

12:30.717 --> 12:32.183
And I know that you're...

12:32.252 --> 12:33.351
Yeah?

12:34.621 --> 12:35.820
You're handsome.

12:35.955 --> 12:39.524
Wow. I-- I'm gonna need
fergus' number.

12:39.593 --> 12:42.927
It would be my privilege
to give it to you.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.462
Okay.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.863
Oh! "undies."

12:45.999 --> 12:47.531
Yeah.
That's real.

12:48.702 --> 12:51.402
Hey!
Hey.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.572
I'm a bottom bunk man, myself.
You're redoing your bedroom?

12:54.641 --> 12:58.009
No. It's a hostel.
And it sleeps eight to a room.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.344
Ugh. How many people have used
those sheets?

13:00.380 --> 13:02.080
Well, at a hostel
you bring your own.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.282
Oh, great. Now I need to get
travel sheets

13:04.284 --> 13:05.550
Along with a neck wallet.

13:05.685 --> 13:06.884
It's not so bad.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.153
Please, paul!
This is a nightmare!

13:09.222 --> 13:10.955
I mean, then again,

13:11.024 --> 13:13.491
Maybe I will meet ethan hawke
and fall in love.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.392
Or have a threesome and get
arrested for murder.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.362
That's all I really know
about europe.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.497
Which reminds me of a camping
trip I took.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.266
Did you grow as a person?

13:21.268 --> 13:23.835
I guess. You know, my dad was
never really around much.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.169
Broken home?

13:25.238 --> 13:27.205
No, he was working.
Like, heists?

13:27.274 --> 13:29.440
He was a high school principal.
Oh.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.510
But he would take us out
and he'd catch a fish

13:32.579 --> 13:35.380
And then undercook it
and we'd be sick

13:35.382 --> 13:37.515
And freezing
in our sleeping bags.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.184
To this day, I can't vomit
without thinking about him.

13:40.187 --> 13:43.321
It's just, lara's given me
her travel points.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.190
She even sat beside me at lunch
today and she never does that.

13:46.259 --> 13:49.393
She mostly talked about herself,
but to me!

13:49.429 --> 13:51.562
Well, keep your mouth shut
and go to europe.

13:53.400 --> 13:57.101
Or tell lara the truth and have
her never talk to you again.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.569
It's up to you.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.939
How do you say "I'm scared"
in polish?

14:02.075 --> 14:03.407
I don't know,

14:03.476 --> 14:06.744
But I don't think we can say
those jokes anymore.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.079
♪

14:09.115 --> 14:11.415
Fergus:
It's still best to avoid
ableist statements.

14:11.484 --> 14:15.119
Now, let's move on to the four
most common types of hostility.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.889
Sorry, I was making reservations
at a bosnian burger king.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.156
What did I miss?

14:19.158 --> 14:20.825
Boobety-boobety.
That's what I heard.

14:20.827 --> 14:21.826
Nikki.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.428
Welcome. I'm fergus. He/him.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.363
Bar manager,
singer-songwriter,

14:25.432 --> 14:27.164
Mediation manager
and conflict coach.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.099
Those last two
sound the same.

14:29.135 --> 14:31.435
Kristian!
No need to explain your truth.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.004
That's okay.
It's a great talking point.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.505
Great talking point, kristian.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.407
Conflict resolution
is a set of techniques

14:36.542 --> 14:38.810
Used to resolve conflict
with or without a third party.

14:38.945 --> 14:42.013
Mediation just means a third
party helping resolve any issue.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.915
Beautiful.
Keep your pants on.

14:43.917 --> 14:47.252
I'm just saying it's a good
explanation. You nailed it!

14:47.387 --> 14:50.120
Thanks. But actually,
we should avoid phrases

14:50.156 --> 14:52.189
Like "nailed it" or
"slayed it."

14:52.225 --> 14:53.724
They imply violence
and can be triggering.

14:53.793 --> 14:56.527
So can the word "trigger."
oh, sweet jesus.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.996
Oh! Religious slights
also fall into the category

14:59.032 --> 15:01.165
Of microaggressions.

15:01.167 --> 15:03.935
Sorry, you're telling me about
microaggressions?

15:04.070 --> 15:05.470
Just something to be aware of.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.005
Shannon:
So that's a nano no-no?

15:07.007 --> 15:08.006
I wouldn't put it like that.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.807
Right. Nano no-no noted.

15:09.942 --> 15:10.942
Seriously, ross.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.310
Now, speaking of hostility,

15:12.445 --> 15:14.946
I understand shannon openly
mocked an employee?

15:15.081 --> 15:16.880
Not exactly.
She made fun of her feet.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.283
In front of everyone.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.884
I was just trying to
fight for a fallen friend

15:20.019 --> 15:22.086
Before checking to see if the
friend had actually fallen

15:22.221 --> 15:24.288
And... I am sorry.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.690
Good. You're starting your
journey.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.092
Oh.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.028
You see, calling deb's feet
large was disrespectful.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.562
But by acknowledging it,

15:31.631 --> 15:34.632
Shannon took a step
towards change.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.368
Would anyone else like to take
a step with shannon?

15:38.571 --> 15:40.304
Okay, I have to stop you there.

15:40.307 --> 15:41.939
I know we want a respectful
workplace,

15:41.975 --> 15:44.308
But we also want a workplace
where we actually work.

15:44.344 --> 15:48.646
So, I don't mean to...
Macro-pressure you, or whatever,

15:48.715 --> 15:50.180
But we need to wrap this up in,
like, ten

15:50.216 --> 15:51.649
So we can get back to it.

15:51.784 --> 15:55.386
But we still all have a lot to
learn from fergus.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.188
Oh, I get it,
I just don't think

15:57.257 --> 15:58.723
We need to keep drinking his
kool-aid.

15:58.792 --> 15:59.924
Oh, wow.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.192
That's a statement that we might
want to unpack.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.729
Ah, right. Yeah. We can't say
that anymore because...

16:04.798 --> 16:07.164
Sorry, can you remind me why
we can't say that?

16:07.166 --> 16:09.066
Because the kool-aid man
expresses violence,

16:09.102 --> 16:10.401
Breaking through walls.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.637
They serve it at church,
but I don't approve.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.005
No, no, the kool-aid comes from
that cult guy,

16:15.041 --> 16:16.541
Jim henson.
Jim jones.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.343
Jim henson made the puppets
that are offensive now.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.845
See? And they did everything
that jim told them to do.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.014
The muppets?

16:23.016 --> 16:24.448
Oh my god. This is so stupid!

16:24.517 --> 16:26.284
Okay, I think we're all getting
a little off track.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.019
Let's just remember
why we're here.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.820
Because you said
deb had hogs for dogs.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.255
You made fun of them first!

16:31.257 --> 16:33.057
I only said it 'cause I thought
you were gonna say it again!

16:33.093 --> 16:34.291
Okay, ladies, ladies.
Calm down.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.259
Oh!
Wow! Okay.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.394
Whoa, there, fergie.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.695
No coming back from that.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.196
No, I'm so-- I'm so sorry.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.299
I am-- I am still very much
on my journey.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.634
And it is time to journey
on out of here.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.436
I'm still getting paid
for the hour, right?

16:45.472 --> 16:48.239
I already e-transferred you.
Password is undies.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.307
Oh, ross.
What?

16:50.377 --> 16:52.176
(quietly)
no.

16:52.311 --> 16:53.577
(sighing)

16:53.646 --> 16:57.148
♪

16:57.150 --> 16:58.916
Good news! Spoke to jürgen.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.051
Who?

17:00.186 --> 17:02.253
Düsseldorf jürgen, who runs
the havenbound hostel?

17:02.388 --> 17:04.255
He's willing to let you stay
at the hostel for free

17:04.324 --> 17:06.056
If you work at the vegan cafe.

17:06.192 --> 17:09.059
Working on vacation? Fun!

17:09.095 --> 17:11.062
You don't get that on a cruise.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.164
No, you would get a staph
infection.

17:13.299 --> 17:14.965
And don't worry about
hostel living.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.234
I bought you pepper spray.

17:17.303 --> 17:18.769
It's lemon scented.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.405
It's a gift. You don't have to
pay me for it.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.840
Though it wasn't cheap.
I bought you the expensive kind.

17:22.975 --> 17:24.742
You can't tell from the
packaging, but the quality--

17:24.811 --> 17:26.544
Okay, look!
I don't want to go to europe!

17:26.613 --> 17:29.880
All right? I don't want to
tape my passport to my stomach

17:29.916 --> 17:32.817
Or figure out how many rubles
it takes to buy white strips.

17:32.952 --> 17:34.185
But you said you wanted this.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.619
Ah, no! You did!

17:35.688 --> 17:38.289
You took control of my decisions
and made me feel special

17:38.424 --> 17:40.091
And turned me into a day
labourer!

17:40.226 --> 17:41.459
I don't think that's true.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.360
The whole point of a vacation is
to relax, alright?

17:43.396 --> 17:46.497
So you can take your
land-walking torture trip

17:46.632 --> 17:48.632
And you can just shove it!

17:51.004 --> 17:53.437
I'm so sorry.

17:53.473 --> 17:57.541
It's okay. I didn't want to owe
jürgen a favour anyway.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.843
Great.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.447
But we're still on for moxie's,
right?

18:03.516 --> 18:06.416
I'll text you... Babe.

18:07.454 --> 18:08.853
♪

18:08.988 --> 18:10.454
So ross, what did we learn?

18:10.523 --> 18:12.389
That it's not cool to talk like
the swedish muppet.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.192
Not when you're apologizing.

18:14.327 --> 18:17.060
I know. I need to set a better
example as a boss

18:17.097 --> 18:18.662
And as a person.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.330
You know, when I started
building condos,

18:20.366 --> 18:21.599
I made a lot of mistakes.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.869
Because I only saw the buildings
from my perspective,

18:24.871 --> 18:26.070
A way to make profit.

18:26.205 --> 18:28.339
So, I cut corners and
regulations

18:28.341 --> 18:30.341
And people's feelings got hurt.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.942
But just their feelings, right?

18:31.978 --> 18:34.745
Point is, through a series of
lawsuits and sealed testimonies,

18:34.747 --> 18:37.014
I got to learn about other
people's points of view.

18:37.083 --> 18:41.152
And now I think about them every
time I design a new building.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.586
And you don't screw up anymore.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.623
Well, I'm making an effort.
As required by law.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.758
Then, hopefully, we can see
today as a good thing.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.695
We can try.
To better buildings.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.829
I'm still unclear if
there were any casualties.

18:52.866 --> 18:55.833
Cheers.
Santé.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.969
Joy! Wait!

18:58.104 --> 18:59.836
Is moxie's back on?

18:59.873 --> 19:01.838
Mix86 is giving away more
cruise tickets.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.474
No! Really?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.543
Jamal:
<i> Hey this is mix86.</i>
<i> Please stand by.</i>

19:05.545 --> 19:07.478
You really didn't
have to do this.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.446
I did.
Europe was my thing.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.582
Your thing is boat vacations

19:11.584 --> 19:14.452
With people who love soap operas
and play pickleball.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.320
<i> Hi, we're on the air</i>
<i> with joy.</i>

19:16.356 --> 19:17.788
Oh my god!
Jamal just said my name.

19:17.824 --> 19:21.592

19:29.836 --> 19:31.468
It's the royal pavilion
in brighton!

19:31.504 --> 19:32.870

<i> Ooh, I'm sorry, joy.</i>

19:32.939 --> 19:35.072

<i> Next caller.</i>

19:38.611 --> 19:40.744
(line disconnecting)

19:40.780 --> 19:43.748
Brighton?
Where the hell is brighton?!

19:43.883 --> 19:45.583
It's home to literally
the most famous symbol

19:45.585 --> 19:46.951
Of the romantic period.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.319
Well, except for maybe
the palace of westminster.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.490
Are you serious right now?

19:52.625 --> 19:54.692
Or I could buy you
a cruise ticket?

19:54.761 --> 19:57.027
Cabin by the waterslide
would be great.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.570
Hey, deb-deb!

20:06.639 --> 20:08.039
Shannon... Shannon.

20:08.174 --> 20:09.306
Heading out?

20:09.342 --> 20:10.641
Ah, looks like it.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.909
Plans tonight?
Hanging with bae?

20:12.946 --> 20:14.779
No. She has synchro.

20:14.781 --> 20:18.716
Of course. Ah, the dogs love the
new bully sticks, b-t-dubs.

20:18.785 --> 20:22.586
Bunch of bully lovers.
The sticks-- not actual bullies.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.722
Not that there are any bullies
around here.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.123
I disagree.

20:26.125 --> 20:29.260
But you know, when nice people
display bully-ish behaviour,

20:29.262 --> 20:33.597
It's usually sometimes because
they've been hurt themselves.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.867
I was talking about greta and
spike, but go on.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.969
I didn't mean to say
what I said, but the truth is,

20:39.005 --> 20:43.540
Someone once told me
that I had "hogs for dogs."

20:43.542 --> 20:44.942
That's--
horrible, I know.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.477
And I didn't deserve it,
especially from my dance partner

20:47.513 --> 20:49.880
At charleston regionals,
joey mcgulley.

20:49.949 --> 20:53.483
He hadn't hit puberty
and I think he was lashing out.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.086
The charleston's a dance.

20:56.122 --> 20:56.987
Yeah, I'm aware.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.622
I just hope we can
move past this.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.791
'kay. Um, I'll see you
next week.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.627
And, uh, this is for you.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.701
No-slip all-terrain
water shoes.

21:10.770 --> 21:14.571
