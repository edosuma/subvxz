<i>Announcer:</i>
<i>You're watching</i> second chance.

00:03.004 --> 00:05.137
What we're about to do
should be left to god.

00:05.139 --> 00:08.807
<i>Catch all-new episodes</i>

00:08.809 --> 00:11.543
Rosewood, bones<i> and</i> lucifer.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.145
-What's your name?
-Lucifer.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.313
Like the devil?

00:14.315 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on fox.</i>

00:17.518 --> 00:19.151
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on "second chance"...</i>

00:19.153 --> 00:20.953
Woman: Disgraced sheriff
jimmy pritchard

00:20.955 --> 00:22.187
Took his own life today.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.026
You're the first to journey
all the way back --

00:27.028 --> 00:28.727
To get another chance.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.797
James: I know you. You're one of
those rich computer twins.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.632
Otto re-coded
your white blood cells

00:33.634 --> 00:35.200
To fight the cancer
in my blood.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.836
You brought me back
to save you.

00:37.838 --> 00:40.639
He's stronger
than predicted.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.346
Sorry.
Mister, do I know you?

00:47.348 --> 00:49.882
What is your connection
to my father?!

00:49.884 --> 00:51.316
Who the hell are you?

00:51.318 --> 00:53.318
I'm sheriff jimmy pritchard.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.822
Old james: Wake up!

00:59.360 --> 01:01.226
Wake up!

01:04.398 --> 01:07.099
I don't know what the hell
you're laying down for anyway.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.004
There's something in the genes,

01:12.006 --> 01:14.573
Made it so that they could
bring you back.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.376
One in 10 million.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.977
You're very rare.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.454
We're dead.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.788
Wake up, sheriff.

01:34.128 --> 01:36.261
(sighs)

02:01.789 --> 02:04.523
(thunder rumbles)

02:17.771 --> 02:21.006
Both these men were doing life
for a meth-fueled double murder.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.342
Once locked up, they got
some real violent religion.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.444
Called themselves
"reborn in blood."

02:25.446 --> 02:28.514
Seattle p.D. Has asked us
to help track them down.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.982
Work your contacts
and the data.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.750
They stick their heads up,
I want us there.

02:31.752 --> 02:35.521
Go get 'em.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.222
Agent pritchard,
a word.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.764
Pritchard, I know
some of these other agents

02:45.766 --> 02:47.132
Are looking at you sideways

02:47.134 --> 02:48.634
For turning your partner
and your boss in,

02:48.636 --> 02:51.303
But from where I stand,
that was damn fine work.

02:51.305 --> 02:54.339
You took an oath,
and you defended it.
Thank you, ma'am.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.441
Listen, right now, it's about
getting those two convicts,

02:56.443 --> 02:57.943
But then you and I need
to have a talk

02:57.945 --> 03:00.245
About exactly what happened
on that bridge.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.549
Who the hell are you?

03:03.551 --> 03:05.717
What is your connection
to my father?!

03:05.719 --> 03:07.352
Not right now.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.391
I'll make myself available.

03:15.529 --> 03:19.198
After the first round of
regenerated blood transfusions,

03:19.200 --> 03:22.301
Mary's numbers are no better.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.703
At this rate...

03:24.705 --> 03:27.973
Her cancer will spread
to her lymph nodes.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.576
If nothing changes,

03:30.578 --> 03:35.314
My sister will be gone
by the end of the year.

03:35.316 --> 03:38.083
But the donor grows stronger...

03:38.085 --> 03:41.853
Much stronger than
any of my models anticipated.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.989
Just days
after his regeneration,

03:43.991 --> 03:47.726
His maximum oxygen uptake is
342 milliliters --

03:47.728 --> 03:50.495
Six times that
of an elite athlete.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.164
His dynamic muscle recovery

03:52.166 --> 03:55.500
Following isokinetic
fatigue testing is 100%.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.703
His body,
so recently old and frail,

03:57.705 --> 04:01.206
Is now operating at the very
limits of human capacity.

04:01.208 --> 04:04.876
His blood<i> will</i> save my sister.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.912
It has to.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.747
So that nothing happens to him,

04:08.749 --> 04:12.184
He will be confined to
this house until that happens.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.590
Woman: In other news,
convicted killers

04:18.592 --> 04:20.626
Leo stax and edward hume

04:20.628 --> 04:23.762
Remain at large after escaping
from pine creek prison

04:23.764 --> 04:25.297
Following a riot that broke out

04:25.299 --> 04:27.799
During the city-wide blackout
three days ago.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.435
Authorities have now confirmed
that the riot began

04:30.437 --> 04:32.871
When backup generators
failed to activate.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.973
A third prisoner
captured in the shootout

04:34.975 --> 04:37.743
Remains in custody
at king memorial hospital.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.645
Mr. Pritchard,
mary is waiting

04:39.647 --> 04:42.180
For her transfusion
on the second floor.

04:43.884 --> 04:47.419
You know, if this works,
then we try it on others.

04:47.421 --> 04:50.088
You know how many lives
you could possibly save?

04:50.090 --> 04:52.457
Must make my blood
pretty valuable.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.159
It does.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.627
Hmm.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.165
What are you doing?
Negotiating.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.000
Alfred, show her
what I was just watching.

05:02.002 --> 05:05.737
Arthur: It is arthur.
Showing now.

05:05.739 --> 05:08.573
A few days ago, there was
a city-wide power surge

05:08.575 --> 05:11.310
That shut down security
at that prison.

05:11.312 --> 05:12.778
There was a riot.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.346
Three cons escaped.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.315
Cops caught one,
but there are two murderers

05:16.317 --> 05:18.517
Out there in seattle.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.452
I did the math,
and I know what was happening

05:20.454 --> 05:22.854
Right before
those lights went out.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.023
Well, so do I.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.526
That's when
we brought you back.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.128
The power otto used
from the grid to regenerate you

05:30.130 --> 05:31.430
Caused the surge
and blackout

05:31.432 --> 05:33.365
And shut down
the prison security system.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.000
By the time
they got the lights back on,

05:35.002 --> 05:36.635
Those prisoners had
already escaped.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.203
Through our foundation,

05:38.205 --> 05:41.173
We've been funneling money
and tech to local authorities.

05:41.175 --> 05:45.177
I know we caused this,
and we're helping to fix it.

05:45.179 --> 05:48.447
Now...Can you please
let go of that tube,

05:48.449 --> 05:50.349
Or are we
still negotiating?

05:50.351 --> 05:52.684
Those two killers
are out there in my city.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.188
I'm the sheriff.

05:56.190 --> 05:59.825
You want to find those men,
I'm the man to do it.

05:59.827 --> 06:03.729
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

06:03.731 --> 06:05.697
Okay.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.466
I'll give you
the full power of lookinglass

06:07.468 --> 06:08.734
To help you
find those men.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.672
The convict they caught is
in the hospital.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.807
Took a bullet
during his capture.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.642
I'd like
to question him.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.478
I'm sure the police
already have.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.413
We may have
different methods.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.354
How you doing, deputy?

06:29.356 --> 06:30.856
Can I help you?

06:30.858 --> 06:33.191
Yeah, I'm with the prisoners'
rights commission.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.359
Prisoner what?

06:34.361 --> 06:35.827
I'm just here
to make sure

06:35.829 --> 06:37.262
The prisoner has everything
he's entitled to.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.897
Department of corrections
should have cleared me.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.599
Name is steven decker.

06:42.870 --> 06:46.671
Bypassing department
of corrections database now.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.909
Been with
the department long?

06:50.911 --> 06:52.944
Going on 20.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.880
So you were there
under pritchard.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.581
Guy got a bum rap.

07:02.523 --> 07:05.123
You can go in.
Thanks.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.925
Prisoners' rights, huh?

07:06.927 --> 07:12.330
Yeah, like I said, be sure
he gets everything he deserves.

07:18.439 --> 07:19.905
Who the hell are you?

07:19.907 --> 07:22.574
I'm from
prisoners' rights.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.576
How did this happen?

07:24.578 --> 07:26.778
I wasn't even planning
on escaping.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.981
The lights when out,
the riot started.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.584
Stax and hume
got through.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.287
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

07:35.289 --> 07:38.557
It was like god was
telling me to go.

07:38.559 --> 07:43.161
You can't shoot a man
for listening to god, can you?

07:43.163 --> 07:44.729
You guys have a plan?

07:44.731 --> 07:47.899
Way out of the country,
place to lay low?

07:47.901 --> 07:50.635
What the hell's that got to do
with my rights?

07:50.637 --> 07:53.004
You in a lot of pain?

07:53.006 --> 07:54.639
(sighs) well...

07:54.641 --> 07:56.341
Nowhere near as much pain
as you're gonna be in

07:56.343 --> 07:58.777
If you don't help me
find those other two.

07:58.779 --> 08:02.347
You're not from
prisoners' rights.

08:02.349 --> 08:04.082
No, I'm not.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.450
Then go to hell.

08:05.452 --> 08:07.319
(muffled shouting)

08:07.321 --> 08:08.954
(muffled screaming)

08:08.956 --> 08:11.756
You're gonna help me
find those other two escapees --

08:11.758 --> 08:15.494
Who might be helping,
where they might be hiding.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.928
You three were
on the run together,

08:16.930 --> 08:19.764
So you must have had
some kind of plan.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.333
I'm gonna
tell you a secret.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.768
(muffled screaming)

08:23.770 --> 08:26.204
I have no idea
how strong I am.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.139
Now, that egghead
at the house,

08:28.141 --> 08:31.543
He says like five times
a normal man.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.178
Do you want to find out?

08:35.215 --> 08:37.382
He's resting
comfortably.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.485
It's me, pritchard.

08:40.487 --> 08:42.053
How'd it go?

08:42.055 --> 08:43.688
He was very chatty.
They're gonna get their guns

08:43.690 --> 08:45.023
From an ex-con
called luther verneck.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.291
Can you
get me his address?

08:46.293 --> 08:47.526
Give me a minute.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.634
You.

08:55.636 --> 08:56.868
It's you.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.815
What are you in for?

09:10.817 --> 09:12.918
Oh, they put a stent
in my heart.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.185
I had four done
right here.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.254
You'll be on your feet
in no time.

09:18.692 --> 09:21.860
Yeah, they say 70 years of
red meat is what did it to me.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.628
That's what they said
to me, too!

09:24.998 --> 09:28.333
Not...70, obviously.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.402
I mean,
more like 35, 30.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.005
Not 70.
That's crazy.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.011
This is my floor.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.284
Mr. Pritchard?

09:46.286 --> 09:48.520
The man those escaped convicts
are going to

09:48.522 --> 09:50.255
Has been arrested
several times

09:50.257 --> 09:52.424
For trafficking
illegal firearms.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.459
I'll send the address.
Thanks.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.445
So, new york conference call
at 10:00,

10:13.447 --> 10:15.213
Then you have london
at 10:45.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.048
(voice breaking)
and then, um...

10:17.050 --> 10:19.451
(sniffles)
then you have a lunch

10:19.453 --> 10:22.253
At the civic club
about the college endowment.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.389
Alexa, are you okay?

10:24.391 --> 10:26.458
Yeah. Yes.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.760
I am great.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.462
No!
I'm not okay.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.163
Mary, you've stopped
your chemo,

10:32.165 --> 10:34.566
And you're not going to see
your oncologist?

11:04.164 --> 11:05.864
Hands up.
On the floor.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.201
And you're trying to
keep this whole thing a secret,

11:10.203 --> 11:12.103
And you're not even easing up
on your work load.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.805
And you're being so nice
and giving me a tissue,

11:13.807 --> 11:15.106
And you're
the sweetest ever,

11:15.108 --> 11:16.441
And I think
it's too much for me.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.843
It's going to be okay,
I promise.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.178
(nose blowing)

11:23.016 --> 11:24.883
Alexa, why don't you
go clean up.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.018
That's a great idea.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.054
Arthur, show her.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.489
I've hacked into
the cops' body cams.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.324
This is happening
right now.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.827
Man: On the floor!
Do it now!

11:35.829 --> 11:38.163
I'm not the guy
you're looking for, all right?

11:38.165 --> 11:40.131
I said now!

11:41.702 --> 11:43.068
This what happens
when he goes out.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.503
Unknown variables,
unintended consequences.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.005
It is complete chaos.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.673
It's a puzzle, otto --
solve it.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.508
Please don't come
any closer.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.177
Get down right now!
Get on the ground!

11:52.179 --> 11:53.545
I don't want anyone
to get hurt.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.879
Get down!

11:54.881 --> 11:56.548
Hey, back off!
He's not listening, man.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.049
I'm gonna hit him
with my taser.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.384
Arthur:
The potential for violence

11:59.386 --> 12:02.153
And mr. Pritchard's arrest
is now 98%.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.922
Arthur,
who makes those tasers?

12:03.924 --> 12:05.623
This is
your last warning.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.399
(men shouting)

12:17.504 --> 12:20.672
Mr. Pritchard?
Mr. Pritchard?

12:23.710 --> 12:25.877
Otto?
What just happened?

12:25.879 --> 12:27.846
There's no way I could
possibly explain it to you,

12:27.848 --> 12:30.515
But I would recommend
that you run, now.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.868
Oh!

12:49.870 --> 12:51.669
(both gasping)

12:54.474 --> 12:56.307
Oh, please, mister,
don't be dead!

12:56.309 --> 12:58.109
I'm so screwed
if you're dead.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.114
Are you dead?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.750
I used to be, not anymore.
I gotta go.

13:05.752 --> 13:08.353
(coughs)

13:17.464 --> 13:19.397
He is your cure. Why would you
let him walk out the door?

13:19.399 --> 13:20.565
'cause he's a person,
otto.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.834
He is our person.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.736
We made him.

13:24.738 --> 13:27.172
If he gets caught,
what happens to us?

13:27.174 --> 13:28.973
Us?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.276
(sniffles)

13:31.278 --> 13:35.313
This...
This is because of us.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.289
Those lives are ended,
and we can't bring them back.

13:44.291 --> 13:47.792
Pritchard thinks he can
get the men who did this.

13:47.794 --> 13:51.362
If he gets caught,
that's a chance we have to take.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.434
He ran guns.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.936
It seems our cons
stax and hume

13:57.938 --> 13:59.671
Killed him
and took his stash.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.874
We can now assume that stax
and hume are both heavily armed.

14:02.876 --> 14:05.109
Agent pritchard, tasers fried
the body cam footage,

14:05.111 --> 14:06.611
But we managed
to get this.

14:06.613 --> 14:07.846
He was standing
over the dead guy

14:07.848 --> 14:09.047
When the cops
rolled in.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.882
(sighs)

14:33.373 --> 14:36.107
Arthur: Maintenance initiated.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.546
I was hoping
to talk to security.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.914
When miss goodwin
heard you were here,

14:42.916 --> 14:44.849
She asked
to see you herself.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.885
Agent pritchard,
how can I help you?

14:46.887 --> 14:48.253
Well, like I told
your assistant,

14:48.255 --> 14:50.054
I was hoping
to talk to security.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.523
I'm not sure this is
a c.E.O. Matter.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.425
Not sure what is
a c.E.O. Matter?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.796
I'm looking for the man
who is driving this car.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.341
That car is registered
to your corporation?

15:10.343 --> 15:11.676
That's not really a question,
is it?

15:11.678 --> 15:13.711
You can see
it's registered to us.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.446
Ma'am, I'd like
to see that car.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.215
Why are you here,
agent pritchard?

15:17.217 --> 15:18.549
I want to know
who that man is.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.118
You show up
without a warrant,

15:20.120 --> 15:21.920
You want to talk to my security
because you figure

15:21.922 --> 15:23.421
Since they're ex-lawmen,

15:23.423 --> 15:25.256
They'll share information
with you in confidence...

15:25.258 --> 15:26.424
Without a warrant.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.259
There was
a killing today.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.428
I think
that man is involved.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.863
And I will
look into that.

15:31.865 --> 15:33.765
But have you told
your superiors this?

15:33.767 --> 15:35.566
Will they know
that you're here?

15:35.568 --> 15:37.936
I can tell this means
a lot to you, agent pritchard,

15:37.938 --> 15:39.938
And that you want
to get this done.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.907
But, please, you need
to have your organization

15:42.909 --> 15:45.710
Deal properly
with my corporation.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.445
Okay?

15:47.447 --> 15:49.714
Okay.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.449
Thank you.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.821
Maintenance complete.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.256
There will be
some soreness,

15:58.258 --> 16:00.425
But the tank healed
the fractured ribs.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.660
You think my son's
just gonna walk away

16:02.662 --> 16:04.662
'cause you gave him
a spanking in your office?

16:04.664 --> 16:07.765
I think I made it clear
he has no choice.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.500
Why?
What do you think?

16:09.502 --> 16:12.103
I think duval is
an honest-to-god good person.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.271
I think that's probably

16:13.273 --> 16:15.139
Something he got
from his mother.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.309
I think with lives on the line,
my son will ruin his career.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.279
When he's gone to jail,
he could tell the fbi about me

16:21.281 --> 16:24.315
And the bridge, about the car
tracing back to lookinglass.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.318
Duval will expose it all
if it helps catch those killers.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.786
So, what do we do?

16:28.788 --> 16:30.855
(sighs)

16:30.857 --> 16:32.824
I'll need
my old name back.

16:34.995 --> 16:38.296
This guy is connected
to those two escaped cons.

16:38.298 --> 16:42.433
Are you telling me no one here
can find out who he is?

16:44.104 --> 16:46.170
And where the hell is
duval pritchard?

16:46.172 --> 16:49.173
All right, these are
the bank statements,

16:49.175 --> 16:51.142
Gracie's
college-fund insurance.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.644
I'm not sure I understand
what you're saying to me, duval.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.513
What I'm saying is
that I have done something

16:55.515 --> 16:56.948
That I shouldn't have.

16:56.950 --> 16:58.883
I got myself jammed up,

16:58.885 --> 17:00.885
And I need to go into the fbi
and talk about it.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.186
You'll get it
straightened out,

17:02.188 --> 17:03.688
I mean, you always
take care of things.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.189
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, helen.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.724
I may not get it
straightened out this time.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.559
And if that happens,
I'm gonna need you

17:08.561 --> 17:10.628
To take care of things
for a while, okay?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.230
Okay, now
you're scaring me.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.865
I mean, what does that
even mean?

17:13.867 --> 17:16.901
It means that I need you
to do whatever you have to do

17:16.903 --> 17:20.204
To take care of gracie.
What did you do, duval?

17:20.206 --> 17:22.407
Dad?

17:22.409 --> 17:23.708
Gracie, honey,
I didn't --

17:23.710 --> 17:25.176
Dad, there's someone here
to see you.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.311
All right.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.917
Gracie,
step away from him.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.852
What are you
gonna do, duval?

17:34.854 --> 17:36.320
Shoot your own brother?

17:37.323 --> 17:38.556
You're my what?

17:40.827 --> 17:42.994
You're my half-brother,
that's what you're saying.

17:42.996 --> 17:44.896
You must have
a lot of questions.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.364
Oh, yeah, just a few.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.266
Like who's your mom?

17:48.268 --> 17:49.901
She that waitress
from coco's?

17:49.903 --> 17:51.436
Do I have other siblings
I don't know about,

17:51.438 --> 17:52.603
Or are you just a one-off?

17:52.605 --> 17:54.105
No, scrap those.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.773
What I want to know
is what is your relationship

17:55.775 --> 17:57.408
With the lookinglass
corporation?

17:57.410 --> 17:58.943
Actually, no,
let's not start there.

17:58.945 --> 18:01.446
Why do you keep showing up
at my crime scenes,

18:01.448 --> 18:02.880
And what are you doing

18:02.882 --> 18:04.549
Standing over the body
of a murdered gun dealer.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.017
I know you think you
ought to turn yourself in

18:06.019 --> 18:07.685
And come clean about me
and the bridge,

18:07.687 --> 18:09.020
But that's not
what you really want.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.188
What do I really want?

18:10.190 --> 18:11.522
You want
to catch those guys.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.224
They're gunned up now.

18:13.226 --> 18:16.027
They're gonna do something
with those weapons in my...

18:16.029 --> 18:17.695
In this city.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.564
You want to stop them,
then you got to come with me.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.933
Every cop in seattle
is looking for you.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.902
You first tell me why I don't
put you in cuffs right now.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.238
Your father told me
that family is

18:27.240 --> 18:29.207
The most important thing
in the world to you.

18:29.209 --> 18:32.944
I can see it's true
by the way you look at your kid.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.113
I'm family.

18:35.115 --> 18:38.883
You look in my eyes,
and you can see that, can't you?

18:38.885 --> 18:40.651
What's your name?

18:40.653 --> 18:42.053
Do you really think
he's my uncle?

18:42.055 --> 18:43.287
If only because
it makes him

18:43.289 --> 18:45.556
One less available man
in this town.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.592
Well, they
stopped talking.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.660
Well, now what are they doing?
Is it a stare down?

18:49.662 --> 18:51.429
It is a stare down.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.797
Oh, here they come.

18:57.170 --> 19:00.138
You must be helen.
Hey.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.406
And...Gracie.

19:02.408 --> 19:03.908
I am totally flipping out
right now.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.277
A brother --
a secret brother.

19:06.279 --> 19:07.512
Are you totally flipping out
right now?

19:07.514 --> 19:09.113
You really knew
my grandfather?

19:09.115 --> 19:10.281
Gracie.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.782
Yeah, I knew him
pretty well.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.485
You got something to show me,
then show me.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.754
Well, can I ask you
a question?

19:16.756 --> 19:18.923
Do you think
that he killed himself,

19:18.925 --> 19:21.993
Because I don't think
that he would.

19:21.995 --> 19:25.496
Let me tell you something,
little lady...

19:25.498 --> 19:28.299
There is no way that
jimmy pritchard killed himself.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.868
You, we're leaving, now.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.677
He's got
kind of a cowboy vibe.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.579
More like a sheriff.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.389
We think he killed
that gunrunner.

19:51.391 --> 19:54.125
We know he tuned up
your brothers.

19:54.127 --> 19:57.361
All right,
let's find this guy.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.697
James --
james pritchard.

19:59.699 --> 20:00.965
He gave you his name.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.567
I wouldn't make
too much of it.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.468
I'm walking around
with duval.

20:04.470 --> 20:07.572
Duval, and he gives you
his name.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.640
It didn't sound like
he wanted his name anyway.

20:09.642 --> 20:10.908
Make a right here.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.148
Peng's?
Why are we going here?

20:17.150 --> 20:19.317
You got a problem
with this place?

20:22.989 --> 20:25.156
My dad used to bring me here
when I was a kid,

20:25.158 --> 20:27.758
And my mom thought
he was taking me to the park.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.194
I'd sit in a back booth
and do my homework.

20:30.196 --> 20:31.729
And your dad?

20:31.731 --> 20:33.197
Oh, my dad said
he was working.

20:33.199 --> 20:35.733
He was working.
Peng runs chinatown.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.268
He and your dad had
an understanding

20:37.270 --> 20:38.769
That kept the peace.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.338
And every time your dad
put a bad guy away,

20:40.340 --> 20:41.906
He cut a notch
right here.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.077
He took you here, too.
Great.

20:46.079 --> 20:49.347
Look, I appreciate
the trip down memory lane,

20:49.349 --> 20:51.182
But seeing you're
a wanted man...

20:51.184 --> 20:52.583
Maybe you can
get to the point.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.585
The point is
two heavily armed cons

20:54.587 --> 20:56.187
Are hiding out in
the criminal world of seattle.

20:56.189 --> 20:58.189
We need a criminal network
to find him.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.523
We need peng.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.692
Then you'll be
disappointed.

21:01.694 --> 21:05.029
My grandfather is dead --
10 years.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.031
I'm sorry to hear that.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.699
He was a great man.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.801
He was.

21:10.803 --> 21:15.539
So, uh...
Who's running things now?

21:15.541 --> 21:17.808
He left the place to me.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.077
You're little emma,
aren't you?

21:20.079 --> 21:22.079
I was little emma.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.115
Who the hell are you?

21:24.117 --> 21:27.285
Sheriff pritchard...
's kid.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.287
I --
sheriff pritchard's son.

21:29.289 --> 21:31.422
Uh, in fact, two of us.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.024
We're his sons.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.136
When sheriff pritchard was
under investigation,

21:45.138 --> 21:47.471
He never gave up
my grandfather.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.939
He could have.
It would have helped him,

21:48.941 --> 21:51.342
But your father
kept his mouth shut, so...

21:51.344 --> 21:53.778
I just want to thank
his two sons for that.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.646
There's something else
you could do.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.586
No.
That I can't do.

22:02.588 --> 22:03.921
It would be bad
for business

22:03.923 --> 22:05.556
If I helped you
track down escaped cons.

22:08.294 --> 22:10.027
Drinks here are free.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.263
There are other diversions
downstairs, free,

22:12.265 --> 22:14.198
But what reason do I have
to find that out for you?

22:14.200 --> 22:16.667
You owe pritchard.
He kept his mouth shut.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.469
We kissed on it.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.438
Plus, you know, you said it
yourself, he was a hero.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.806
Pretty sure
she didn't say hero.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.040
And you're not
sheriff pritchard,

22:23.042 --> 22:24.842
So the debt is not
a debt to you.

22:26.279 --> 22:28.512
Can I have a word alone?

22:54.407 --> 22:56.273
Let's go get
those killers.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.015
What just happened
in there?

23:05.017 --> 23:07.418
I love the smell
of this alley.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.687
You smell of history, you know,
old seattle.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.155
Pritchard, wait!

23:11.157 --> 23:12.890
Hi.

23:15.595 --> 23:18.162
(chuckles)

23:18.164 --> 23:19.530
Three passports
have been requested

23:19.532 --> 23:21.165
Through a forger
emma knows.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.666
Three?
There are two cons.

23:22.668 --> 23:24.902
One's for stax,
one's for hume,

23:24.904 --> 23:26.604
And one's
for a little girl.

23:26.606 --> 23:29.373
I'll find out if stax
or hume has a daughter.

23:29.375 --> 23:32.109
Where are we going?

23:32.912 --> 23:35.846
Why do we have to leave?
We just do.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.581
When are we coming back?

23:37.583 --> 23:39.650
I'm not sure yet,
sweetheart.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.087
I'm not going.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.289
Just come with me now,
and I'll explain in the car.

23:45.291 --> 23:47.425
This is my house.
I'm not going.

23:47.427 --> 23:50.361
Lisa, please,
we don't have time.

23:50.363 --> 23:52.630
Then tell me why.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.165
(sighs)

23:57.703 --> 23:59.737
It's about your daddy.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.105
My daddy's locked up

24:01.107 --> 24:03.808
In pine creek
federal penitentiary, though.

24:03.810 --> 24:06.143
He was,
but he got out somehow.

24:06.145 --> 24:09.547
I'm worried
he might come for us.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.582
And I can't
let that happen.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.884
We have to go, okay?

24:13.886 --> 24:16.454
(sighs)
okay.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.623
(smooches)
that's my good girl.

24:21.494 --> 24:23.093
Run, run!

24:23.095 --> 24:25.229
(screams)

24:25.231 --> 24:29.133
Who've you been seeing,
huh? Hmm?

24:29.135 --> 24:32.436
Beth, this is
my friend hume.

24:32.438 --> 24:34.638
You call him
the minister.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.274
You're gonna feel
a whole lot better

24:37.276 --> 24:39.643
Once we get in the car.

24:39.645 --> 24:42.313
No record of a relationship for
either stax or hume.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.748
No prison visits, no wives,
no boyfriends, no girlfriends.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.283
Check for
a restraining order.

24:46.285 --> 24:47.685
See if either one of them had
a restraining order.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.119
Restraining order
taken out against them.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.121
Can I get an r.O. Check
on both men?

24:51.123 --> 24:52.423
How did you get that woman

24:52.425 --> 24:53.791
To give you
the passport information?

24:53.793 --> 24:55.426
Your father
and her grandfather

24:55.428 --> 24:57.428
Had this understanding
that kept the streets safe.

24:57.430 --> 24:58.996
I told her
you're an fbi agent,

24:58.998 --> 25:00.531
And if she watched your back,
you'd watch hers.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.766
What, did I compromise my badge,
you told her that?

25:02.768 --> 25:04.168
You want to catch
these guys or not?

25:04.170 --> 25:06.303
Yeah, I do, but I didn't get
the corrupt cop gene.

25:06.305 --> 25:07.805
Stop boo-hooing.
Grow up.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.139
This is how
the world works.

25:09.141 --> 25:11.509
Wow.
You really are his son.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.612
Yeah.

25:14.614 --> 25:15.813
That's fantastic.
All right.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.648
Great. I got it.

25:17.650 --> 25:18.816
Well?

25:18.818 --> 25:20.184
Before going to jail,
stax had

25:20.186 --> 25:21.785
Four restraining orders
taken out against him

25:21.787 --> 25:23.454
By the same woman.
There's our relationship.

25:23.456 --> 25:24.855
Yep, and I got
her address.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.156
Good. Let's go.

25:26.158 --> 25:27.525
Let me see your phone.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.560
My battery died,
and I need to call gracie.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.297
Oh, come on.
You really gonna do this?

25:33.299 --> 25:34.999
I really am
gonna do this.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.134
You like the smell
of this alley,

25:37.136 --> 25:39.470
Enjoy it until
I come back for you.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.744
Please.

25:46.746 --> 25:49.380
I changed
since you went away.

25:49.382 --> 25:50.748
I put down the pipe.

25:50.750 --> 25:53.050
I'm not who you knew.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.685
I know you're mad.

25:54.687 --> 25:55.986
I understand.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.688
But I have a life now.

25:57.690 --> 26:00.724
Stax: Life?
You have a life now, huh?

26:00.726 --> 26:02.993
Tell her the word,
minister.

26:02.995 --> 26:05.429
That's the life
he's come to get.

26:05.431 --> 26:09.500
You had our child, and you kept
it a secret from me.

26:09.502 --> 26:11.869
You changed your name...

26:11.871 --> 26:14.471
So I couldn't find
my own family.

26:16.576 --> 26:19.343
Our child
should have<i> my</i> name.

26:21.948 --> 26:24.014
Ha.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.750
I was hoping you'd have
one of these.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.619
All right.

26:28.621 --> 26:31.155
So I guess
we can get started then.

26:33.759 --> 26:37.528
If anyone got any objections,
speak it up now...

26:37.530 --> 26:40.464
Or forever
hold your peace.

26:40.466 --> 26:44.268
Beth?
Hmm?

26:44.270 --> 26:46.604
I guess not.

26:51.611 --> 26:53.210
(muffled screaming)

26:58.217 --> 26:59.650
Go, go, go!

27:02.822 --> 27:04.555
Duval:
All right, all right.

27:04.557 --> 27:06.123
Okay, it's all right.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.492
Come here.

27:08.494 --> 27:10.260
Come here.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.829
It's all right.

27:11.831 --> 27:14.098
He took her.
He made me say "I do."

27:14.100 --> 27:16.166
When she came home from school,
he took my baby.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.901
She's my life!

27:17.903 --> 27:19.570
You have to find her!

27:19.572 --> 27:21.238
Mary: We have the address
your son got,

27:21.240 --> 27:22.406
But stax
and hume are gone.

27:22.408 --> 27:23.974
They didn't take
the woman,

27:23.976 --> 27:25.909
But they took a little girl,
her daughter.

27:25.911 --> 27:27.578
Jimmy: You to figure out
how to find them.

27:27.580 --> 27:29.446
You did this,
you need to fix it.

27:29.448 --> 27:30.848
The girl's on you.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.483
There might be a way.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.451
She's eight years old,
second grade.

27:34.453 --> 27:35.919
Lookinglass gave a tablet

27:35.921 --> 27:37.688
To every student
in the seattle school system.

27:37.690 --> 27:40.024
If she has hers
with her...

27:40.026 --> 27:41.525
We can pinpoint
her location.

27:41.527 --> 27:42.760
Please hold.

27:50.202 --> 27:51.602
I have an address.
You ready?

27:51.604 --> 27:53.203
Yeah.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.539
80143 mercator.

27:55.541 --> 27:58.008
Gps has a location
at 50 feet off the ground.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.523
He was seen in this area
about an hour ago.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.525
We go door to door.

28:14.527 --> 28:16.026
You still got that door

28:16.028 --> 28:17.594
That leads to the building
across the street?

28:25.171 --> 28:26.870
Bricks?

28:26.872 --> 28:28.672
You bricked up the escape door?
Why would you do that?

28:28.674 --> 28:30.140
What are you doing?

28:30.743 --> 28:32.042
Oh, god!

28:34.580 --> 28:36.547
That wall is
three feet thick.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.851
Okay, well, three feet
of bricks is a no.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.486
That door was too public.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.555
I put a pen out the back
of the walk-in freezer.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.657
It takes you to the building
basement one street over.

28:46.659 --> 28:48.625
Okay.
Use the handle, okay?

28:57.069 --> 28:58.368
Yeah?

28:58.370 --> 29:00.104
Man:
Agent pritchard, you may have

29:00.106 --> 29:02.206
Cuffed someone to this van,
but there's nobody here now.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.574
But there's definitely
something going on down here.

29:03.576 --> 29:05.375
Local p.D. Is
all over this place.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.845
Let me see if I can get
anything useful off this phone.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.750
It's been wiped clean.

29:15.688 --> 29:19.223
I need a tail put on someone.

29:19.225 --> 29:20.858
Mary goodwin.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.427
I wiped his phone. Even the fbi
won't get anything off it.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.028
But, mary,
with no phone,

29:25.030 --> 29:26.563
He will have no timer
to warn him

29:26.565 --> 29:27.898
When he starts
breaking down.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.366
It won't matter.

29:29.368 --> 29:30.734
Pritchard's not gonna stop
until he gets those men

29:30.736 --> 29:32.469
And that little girl
is safe.

29:32.471 --> 29:33.737
You seem certain
of that.

29:33.739 --> 29:35.105
He was corrupt,
he crossed lines,

29:35.107 --> 29:37.541
But never for himself,
always to help others.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.143
He won't stop.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.412
Where are you going?

29:42.414 --> 29:44.047
What happens when he starts
to break down?

29:44.049 --> 29:45.649
Who helps him?
We'll send a drone.

29:45.651 --> 29:47.217
And if he's
inside the building?

29:47.219 --> 29:48.752
If he starts
breaking down then?

29:48.754 --> 29:50.587
It is too dangerous.
Don't go.

29:50.589 --> 29:51.822
I have to.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.957
No, you want to.

29:53.959 --> 29:56.960
I was watching you
and pritchard.

29:56.962 --> 29:59.096
Your pulse was elevated
when you decided

29:59.098 --> 30:01.932
To let him go after
those men.

30:01.934 --> 30:04.134
Do you know
what caused that?

30:30.429 --> 30:32.296
Stax: I know your mom hasn't
told you about me,

30:32.298 --> 30:35.098
But I'm here now,
all right?

30:35.100 --> 30:38.368
Me and your mom,
we're all married up now.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.003
So it's gonna be
all good and proper.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.773
Please, can't I just
go home now, please?!

30:42.775 --> 30:45.108
J-just one more night!
No!

30:47.780 --> 30:50.147
Help!

30:50.149 --> 30:51.782
Help!

30:51.784 --> 30:53.617
(muffled) help!

30:53.619 --> 30:55.219
(normal voice)
I'm sorry I screamed.

30:55.221 --> 30:56.987
I'll never do it again.

30:56.989 --> 30:59.389
Be a good girl,
and you do your homework.

30:59.391 --> 31:00.624
Go on!

31:04.230 --> 31:07.564
Otto?
Otto, look at me.

31:07.566 --> 31:10.734
Otto,
please look at me.

31:10.736 --> 31:14.004
It's not just us
anymore.

31:14.006 --> 31:17.507
Please.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.209
Arthur?

31:22.381 --> 31:24.882
Activate the camera
on the girl's tablet.

31:27.519 --> 31:32.656
Lisa? Lisa?

31:32.658 --> 31:34.992
She's scared.

31:34.994 --> 31:37.027
Who are you?

31:37.029 --> 31:40.364
I'm mary.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.432
You must be scared.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.102
Yes, the men here
have guns,

31:45.104 --> 31:47.437
But there's somebody else
down below.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.940
He's come to help you.

31:49.942 --> 31:52.276
Hume: Hey!
Who are you talking to?

31:52.278 --> 31:53.543
No one!

31:53.545 --> 31:55.445
(slam)

31:55.447 --> 31:57.447
Lisa? Lisa?!

32:05.791 --> 32:08.392
Hey, listen.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.093
What?

32:10.095 --> 32:11.695
I don't hear anything.

32:11.697 --> 32:14.932
Whatever's downstairs
has gone real quiet.

32:14.934 --> 32:16.233
Go see what it is.

32:16.235 --> 32:19.436
Me?<i> You</i> go see
what it is!

33:01.981 --> 33:03.246
(scratching)

33:06.118 --> 33:08.318
(scratching)

33:15.194 --> 33:17.094
(scratching)

33:44.123 --> 33:45.856
Woman: She's pulling into
a parking lot.

33:45.858 --> 33:47.891
Do not engage.

33:47.893 --> 33:49.659
Give me the address
and clear out.

33:49.661 --> 33:51.528
I've got it from here.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.993
Your little girl?

34:22.995 --> 34:24.995
That's right.

34:24.997 --> 34:26.496
I know you don't want
to hurt her.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.131
Not if I don't have to.

34:44.349 --> 34:46.383
You know,
I got married today.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.051
Congratulations.

34:48.053 --> 34:50.454
Yeah, the preacher,
he ministered it.

34:50.456 --> 34:53.190
I got married
to make her right,

34:53.192 --> 34:56.359
I mean her mom and the bond.
You know what I'm saying?

34:56.361 --> 34:59.696
Yeah.
I was married once.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.364
Real good woman.

35:01.366 --> 35:04.034
A chance for her.

35:04.036 --> 35:06.069
Got myself reborn.

35:06.071 --> 35:08.405
You think
that's possible?

35:08.407 --> 35:10.273
Yeah, I do.

35:13.645 --> 35:16.379
What do you say we, uh...

35:16.381 --> 35:17.614
Put the guns down.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.150
Is that what
you want? Huh?

35:20.152 --> 35:22.219
Want daddy
to put his gun down?

35:31.930 --> 35:34.965
Just...

35:34.967 --> 35:36.566
Move them away
a little bit, huh?

35:36.568 --> 35:38.802
Me and her are
walking out of here.

35:38.804 --> 35:41.738
Well...
Let's talk about that.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.473
There's nothing
to talk about.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.342
Because I know
how much...

35:45.344 --> 35:49.179
You cops hate seeing
anything happen to little kids.

35:49.181 --> 35:52.549
So, me and her are
walking out of here.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.852
Who the hell are you?!

35:55.854 --> 35:57.687
The lady on my tablet.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.923
Otto, now.

36:05.430 --> 36:06.596
I was reborn in blood,

36:06.598 --> 36:07.864
And I will re--

36:10.302 --> 36:11.868
You talk too much.

36:16.441 --> 36:18.241
We should go.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.647
It's all right,
sweetie.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.182
Let him carry you.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.423
Let's go.

36:44.036 --> 36:46.136
Hey there.

36:46.138 --> 36:47.537
How you doing?

37:16.001 --> 37:18.401
It's all right, honey.
You can go to your mother now.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.223
I'm not the kind of guy
you would have picked

37:40.225 --> 37:41.992
For this experiment
of yours.

37:43.929 --> 37:47.063
Hell, I wouldn't have
picked me.

37:47.065 --> 37:50.367
You worried about
who you brought back?

37:50.369 --> 37:52.636
Should I be?

37:52.638 --> 37:55.739
(sighs softly)

37:55.741 --> 37:57.540
Mr. Pritchard?

37:57.542 --> 38:00.577
(chuckles softly)

38:00.579 --> 38:02.479
I think
you can call me jimmy.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.750
You don't seem
like a jimmy to me.

38:06.752 --> 38:09.085
What about james?

38:09.087 --> 38:10.987
Yeah, sure, okay.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.555
James.

38:14.926 --> 38:18.261
You're starting to break down,
aren't you, james?

38:18.263 --> 38:20.997
I think we should get you
back in the tank.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.566
I think you're right.

38:23.568 --> 38:24.834
I think you should drive.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.273
Agent pritchard?

38:30.275 --> 38:31.441
Sir?

38:31.443 --> 38:32.609
What?

38:32.611 --> 38:34.077
They found her.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.612
The little girl,
it just came over the radio.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.914
Someone dropped her off
in front of her house.

39:49.321 --> 39:51.020

39:51.022 --> 39:55.225
This used to be a photo
of you standing over that body.

It says so in the paper.

40:20.185 --> 40:21.384
What about him?

40:21.386 --> 40:23.186
You were there,
weren't you?

40:23.188 --> 40:25.188
