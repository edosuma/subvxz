If you see Lil Weezy

11:37.436 --> 11:39.602
or any other delinquents
near my baby again,

11:39.636 --> 11:42.936
you better body-slam 'em,
or I'm gonna body-slam you!

11:42.969 --> 11:44.937
Y-Y-Yes, ma'am.

11:44.969 --> 11:46.503
And then I'm gonna
get you fired!

11:46.537 --> 11:47.771
Yes, ma'am.

11:47.803 --> 11:49.570
I-I would hate
for that day to come.

12:02.340 --> 12:03.507
Hey, Jordan.

12:03.540 --> 12:05.573
Did my new seat cushions
arrive yet?

12:05.606 --> 12:07.374
Mm, not yet.

12:07.407 --> 12:09.541
Clearly, you don't care
if my ass is in pain.

12:10.572 --> 12:11.342
Of course I care
about your ass.

12:11.375 --> 12:13.075
You wouldn't happen to be
shoving a doughnut

12:13.109 --> 12:14.476
into your face, would you?

12:14.508 --> 12:15.676
- Good-bye.
- Huh?

12:15.709 --> 12:17.877
Oh!
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

12:17.910 --> 12:19.710
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- So sorry.

12:19.743 --> 12:21.612
- April, I am so sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

12:21.645 --> 12:23.345
I'm sorry. How's your...
Is your doughnut okay?

12:23.378 --> 12:24.779
Oh, it-it'll survive.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.412
All right.

12:26.445 --> 12:29.846
I got... I got your sugar
all over me.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.681
Wow, that looks so good on you.

12:31.714 --> 12:32.814
- Huh?
- Huh?

12:32.848 --> 12:35.681
- I-I thought you said something.
- No, uh...

12:35.713 --> 12:37.514
So, wait... so are...
Wait, are you gonna do...

12:37.547 --> 12:39.315
gonna pitch your idea
to Jordan today?

12:39.349 --> 12:41.749
- Yeah. Today is the day.
- Yeah? Yeah!

12:41.781 --> 12:43.982
But tomorrow's also good,
too, I heard.

12:44.016 --> 12:45.449
No, no, wait, you...

12:45.483 --> 12:46.916
April, you've been
saying "tomorrow"

12:46.949 --> 12:48.549
for, like, months now.

12:48.582 --> 12:50.750
DiscoverEyes is great.

12:50.782 --> 12:52.050
Yeah, you got to go for it.

12:52.083 --> 12:53.985
Hey.

12:54.018 --> 12:56.352
You got this.

12:56.384 --> 12:57.752
Okay.

12:57.785 --> 12:59.952
- You got this.
- Yeah.

12:59.985 --> 13:02.019
- Oh, wait, that's a step.
- I got it. I'm good.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.853
And you can get this.

13:08.887 --> 13:10.689
- I'm sorry, you say something?
- Huh? No, no, no.

13:10.722 --> 13:11.889
Jordan, Jordan, yeah,
you can...

13:11.922 --> 13:14.390
you can get the product,
the apps...

13:30.558 --> 13:32.459
Mm!

13:32.492 --> 13:34.427
Not gonna catch me slippin'.

13:36.827 --> 13:38.360
Mr. Connor.

13:38.393 --> 13:39.795
May I help you?

13:39.828 --> 13:41.762
I am waiting on Jordan.

13:43.461 --> 13:44.796
Oh, well, um...

13:44.829 --> 13:47.396
would you like to wait
in our lovely lobby?

13:47.429 --> 13:50.997
Nope. She's fine with me
chilling in here.

13:51.029 --> 13:53.063
- Um...
- Cool, cool.

13:53.097 --> 13:54.530
Oh.

13:54.563 --> 13:55.831
Uh, of course.

13:55.864 --> 13:57.498
She is gonna love
that you're sitting

13:57.531 --> 13:59.332
at her desk with your feet up.

13:59.365 --> 14:00.798
I'm just gonna go get her.

14:04.733 --> 14:07.333
She's here!
Take cover, everyone!

14:07.366 --> 14:09.700
I've gotta be at my desk!

14:09.733 --> 14:11.866
- Hurry, hurry!
- I'm sorry.

14:11.900 --> 14:14.335
- Yes, you are.
- Good morning.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.069
Okay.

14:17.102 --> 14:19.003
- So, Connor...
- Shh!

14:19.035 --> 14:21.702
How did you do that?

14:21.736 --> 14:23.370
Thank you.

14:27.104 --> 14:28.805
Why are y'all out here
congregating

14:28.838 --> 14:30.638
like you were in a yard?

14:30.670 --> 14:31.837
Sorry, ma'am. Sorry.

14:31.870 --> 14:34.705
That's not what
I'm paying you for.

14:34.738 --> 14:38.340
Can I interest you
in some magic?

14:39.739 --> 14:43.640
There is no such thing
as magic.

14:43.673 --> 14:45.607
Well, what about
Black Girl Magic?

14:45.640 --> 14:48.675
You're a black girl
fire hazard.

14:48.707 --> 14:50.342
Now, go and disappear.

14:51.441 --> 14:53.575
What?

14:55.908 --> 14:58.043
Happy birthday!

14:58.076 --> 14:59.843
Call the city
and get JS Innovations off

14:59.876 --> 15:03.078
- that dumpy doughnut truck's delivery route.
- Grab the cake!

15:03.111 --> 15:05.678
Of course. Immediate...

15:05.712 --> 15:07.112
Who did this?

15:07.144 --> 15:10.878
I told you guys
no carbs around me!

15:10.911 --> 15:13.679
Oh, uh...

15:13.712 --> 15:15.114
Um...

15:16.714 --> 15:20.414
Your biggest client
is in your office.

15:20.447 --> 15:22.382
Connor?

15:24.716 --> 15:26.550
How did he get up there, April?

15:26.582 --> 15:30.350
You know you're not supposed
to speak directly to him.

15:30.384 --> 15:32.584
I didn't. I... He was
already there when I got there,

15:32.616 --> 15:34.950
and I-I tried
to tell him it's...

15:37.485 --> 15:39.386
Shh.

15:41.452 --> 15:42.853
There she is.

15:42.885 --> 15:44.419
Connor the Incredible.

15:44.452 --> 15:46.720
What a pleasant surprise.

15:46.753 --> 15:50.587
Please, stay seated
with your feet on my desk.

15:50.620 --> 15:53.055
It's... actually fine.

15:53.088 --> 15:54.655
They got to be on the desk.

15:54.689 --> 15:57.589
Up top!

15:58.822 --> 16:00.756
Well, what can I do for you?

16:00.790 --> 16:02.989
I am bouncing to another firm.

16:03.023 --> 16:04.724
What?

16:04.758 --> 16:06.491
No. No.

16:06.524 --> 16:08.991
Connor, you can't jump.
You're my biggest client.

16:09.023 --> 16:11.624
That's why I wanted to give you
the heads-up in person.

16:11.657 --> 16:13.425
Wait a minute.
Where is this coming from?

16:13.458 --> 16:17.426
We just want a fresh voice
to bring in new tech ideas.

16:17.459 --> 16:20.827
Listen, my next product,
it-it's still in beta testing,

16:20.860 --> 16:23.627
but I promise you,
HomeGirl, it's gonna be big.

16:23.661 --> 16:25.462
It's-it's more than
a virtual assistant.

16:25.495 --> 16:28.763
It is a virtual assistant
if she were your homegirl.

16:28.796 --> 16:30.496
It's just not for us.

16:30.529 --> 16:31.896
All right.

16:31.928 --> 16:33.764
Story time, JoJo.

16:33.797 --> 16:35.395
Oh, not again.

16:35.397 --> 16:39.465
When I was a kid,
I lived a hard-knock life.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.897
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyway,

16:40.931 --> 16:42.632
I started getting into tech,

16:42.665 --> 16:45.733
and one day,
I had to come to my dad

16:45.765 --> 16:49.733
and ask for a $10 million loan
to start my company.

16:49.766 --> 16:51.533
And he's like, "What?

16:51.567 --> 16:53.901
"When you start a company,
you don't get ten million.

16:53.934 --> 16:55.602
I'll give you five million."

16:55.635 --> 16:58.136
- And that hurt.
- Wow.

16:58.167 --> 16:59.768
'Cause I was expecting ten.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.737
I had budgeted for ten million.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.503
Mm.

17:03.536 --> 17:05.770
So I go to Grandmother
and Grandfather.

17:05.803 --> 17:07.604
And I'm like,
"Can you invest more millions

17:07.636 --> 17:09.436
of dollars in my company?"

17:09.471 --> 17:11.872
My grandfather's like, "Well,
I don't know what this is."

17:11.905 --> 17:13.472
- No.
- That was hard,

17:13.505 --> 17:15.606
but he gave it to me.
And then, finally,

17:15.638 --> 17:18.606
I sell the company
for $400 million.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.606
So, that's my struggle.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.673
That's how I came up.

17:22.705 --> 17:23.839
I felt that. I do.

17:23.873 --> 17:25.607
I mean, you could
give me a chance

17:25.641 --> 17:28.375
like Grandmother
and Grandfather gave you,

17:28.407 --> 17:30.743
and just... just...

17:30.775 --> 17:33.541
take that leap of faith
and-and-and-and-and-and-and...

17:33.575 --> 17:35.075
and-and-and-and-and-and-and...

17:35.108 --> 17:37.676
- and... and...
- Look, JoJo, okay.

17:37.709 --> 17:40.110
I'm meeting with another firm
to talk about

17:40.144 --> 17:42.011
new gaming app ideas on Friday.

17:42.043 --> 17:44.411
- I'm sowwy.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:44.444 --> 17:46.711
Connor, please just
give me a chance

17:46.745 --> 17:48.879
before you make any rash moves.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.646
All right, fine.

17:52.678 --> 17:54.947
48 hours. Cool?

17:54.980 --> 17:56.614
Yes. I will take it.

17:56.646 --> 17:57.947
Thank you.

17:57.980 --> 18:01.814
And I promise fresh voices
coming at you.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.982
Also, you...
do you know you have, like,

18:04.014 --> 18:07.149
three dinner napkins
on your back?

18:07.183 --> 18:09.150
I didn't know
if that was a choice

18:09.183 --> 18:11.084
or if you leaned
on something or...

18:11.116 --> 18:13.852
No, it's fashion.
It's fashion. It's...

18:13.884 --> 18:16.584
- Oh. You got one shot, JoJo.
- It's fashion.

18:16.618 --> 18:18.386
Don't blow it.

18:18.418 --> 18:20.685
All right, people.

18:20.719 --> 18:22.553
Settle down.

18:23.787 --> 18:25.054
Oh.

18:25.086 --> 18:26.586
Apparently, it's lunch,

18:26.620 --> 18:29.154
since Scott wants to eat
during our meeting.

18:29.186 --> 18:30.887
Okay.

18:39.456 --> 18:41.690
There you go.

18:41.723 --> 18:43.491
Take a bite.

18:45.923 --> 18:47.724
We don't have all day, Scott.

18:47.758 --> 18:49.359
Eat.

18:54.858 --> 18:56.460
Yummy.

18:56.492 --> 18:57.793
Anybody else hungry?

18:57.827 --> 18:59.161
No. I just had salad.

18:59.193 --> 19:01.994
- Mm, I'm fasting.
- All right.

19:02.026 --> 19:04.062
Connor wants a new gaming app,

19:04.094 --> 19:06.428
the best thing
we've ever come up with,

19:06.462 --> 19:08.029
and we're gonna give it to him.

19:08.061 --> 19:10.796
It needs to be big.

19:10.828 --> 19:12.796
- It needs to make noise.
- But when you say

19:12.829 --> 19:14.763
"make noise," do you mean,
like, literally make noise,

19:14.796 --> 19:16.898
like the app makes noise,
or is it just a...

19:16.930 --> 19:18.864
Okay.

19:18.897 --> 19:20.398
I-I get it.

19:20.432 --> 19:22.032
I know that face.

19:22.064 --> 19:24.799
We've got 48 hours
to save our asses.

19:24.832 --> 19:26.733
So let's go.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.766
- Go.
- Impress me, people.

19:28.800 --> 19:32.733
Um, an-an app like, uh, Tinder,

19:32.767 --> 19:36.068
uh, but instead of
matching people for dates,

19:36.101 --> 19:38.802
you match with people
for dating advice,

19:38.834 --> 19:42.735
uh, and then analyze
why all your dates went bad.

19:42.769 --> 19:47.037
So, like Tinder but sad.

19:47.069 --> 19:50.438
Like how your parents felt
the day you were born.

19:50.470 --> 19:52.904
- Oh. Okay.
- Next.

19:52.937 --> 19:58.507
Um, a crossword puzzle app
for news junkies.

19:58.539 --> 20:02.974
So, like a crossword puzzle
that makes you angry.

20:03.006 --> 20:05.774
- No...
- Exactly how I'm feeling

20:05.808 --> 20:08.509
right now when you come up...

20:08.541 --> 20:10.474
- Ow!
- ...with those ding-dong,

20:10.508 --> 20:13.075
ding-dong, bad ideas!

20:13.108 --> 20:15.075
I think I have
a pretty interesting idea.

20:15.109 --> 20:17.743
What? You do, April?

20:17.775 --> 20:19.543
I don't even sound like that.

20:19.577 --> 20:21.844
What's going on?

20:21.876 --> 20:24.444
- Nothing.
- What?

20:24.478 --> 20:25.678
I didn't say anything.

20:25.710 --> 20:27.179
Somebody said something.

20:27.211 --> 20:30.446
Uh, y'all...
y'all need to be quiet.

20:30.478 --> 20:32.879
- We having a meeting up here about important stuff.
- Shh.

20:32.913 --> 20:34.414
Sorry about that.

20:34.446 --> 20:37.114
So, you have nothing?
You have nothing?

20:37.146 --> 20:38.981
Wow.

20:39.015 --> 20:40.181
Nothing.

20:40.215 --> 20:41.882
She didn't say anything.

20:41.915 --> 20:43.715
He thought he heard something.

20:43.749 --> 20:45.949
Y'all ain't said nothing.

20:45.982 --> 20:49.450
Connor is out the door
unless we crack this.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.550
And in case I wasn't clear,

20:51.584 --> 20:54.385
if Connor is out the door,
all of you are out.

20:55.516 --> 20:56.917
Bye-bye, health care.

20:56.951 --> 20:59.119
Which you know you need.

20:59.152 --> 21:01.186
Bye-bye, Ping-Pong table.

21:01.219 --> 21:03.119
Bye-bye, ergonomic chair,

21:04.150 --> 21:06.586
- which...
- Sorry. Dang.

21:11.187 --> 21:15.088
You better stop
quivering that lip.

21:15.122 --> 21:16.790
- You better not cry.
- Stop, girl.

21:16.823 --> 21:19.057
- Stop crying.
- This isn't about you, Melissa.

21:22.088 --> 21:24.125
Are there no more ideas?

21:26.958 --> 21:28.525
Fine.

21:28.557 --> 21:33.058
Once again, I will have to
figure it out myself.

21:33.091 --> 21:34.925
Go. Go!

21:34.959 --> 21:38.560
I can't look at you anymore.

21:40.561 --> 21:42.895
I have an idea for a new app?

21:44.195 --> 21:46.662
Are you asking me
or telling me?

21:46.694 --> 21:48.163
I'm telling you.

21:48.195 --> 21:51.430
I'm telling you that I have
an idea for a new app.

21:51.462 --> 21:53.129
It's called DiscoverEyes,
and I...

21:53.162 --> 21:55.997
No. I don't take pitches
from assistants.

21:56.031 --> 21:57.631
It's just...

21:58.997 --> 22:00.698
I've been here for three years,

22:00.731 --> 22:02.532
and you promised
room for growth and...

22:02.565 --> 22:04.032
So I owe you a promotion?

22:04.064 --> 22:05.800
No, no, no.
That's not what I'm saying.

22:05.832 --> 22:08.065
I... I know this is
a terrible time,

22:08.099 --> 22:10.434
but I-I really think
I could help this company

22:10.466 --> 22:12.699
if you just gave me
a chance like...

22:12.732 --> 22:14.100
someone gave you a chance.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.567
Let me explain something
to you, Miss April.

22:16.601 --> 22:18.101
Nobody gave me anything.

22:18.134 --> 22:20.802
I saw an opportunity,
I took it, and I ran with it.

22:20.836 --> 22:22.936
And you know what?
I'm still running.

22:22.969 --> 22:25.004
Every single day.

22:25.037 --> 22:27.703
You know how many times
I had to pitch my first idea

22:27.736 --> 22:30.071
before I sold it?
Seventeen.

22:30.103 --> 22:33.871
And I sure as hell
didn't take no for an answer.

22:33.904 --> 22:36.905
- Wait, so does that mean you'll hear my pitch?
- No.

22:39.506 --> 22:42.506
You know what it is?
I'm a taker.

22:42.540 --> 22:43.874
You're not.

22:43.907 --> 22:45.874
So just concentrate
on being my assistant

22:45.906 --> 22:48.040
and try being good
at that first.

22:48.074 --> 22:50.109
You can't talk
to April that way.

22:50.142 --> 22:52.476
Who let the fire hazard
in here?

22:52.508 --> 22:54.141
She's just making deliveries.

22:54.175 --> 22:55.643
Come on, Stevie, let's go.

22:55.676 --> 22:57.444
Were you always this way?

22:57.476 --> 23:00.177
- Was I always what way?
- Mean.

23:00.211 --> 23:03.511
No. Actually, I used to be just
like you when I was little.

23:03.544 --> 23:05.945
And you know what?
People treated me like crap.

23:05.977 --> 23:07.211
Then what happened?

23:07.245 --> 23:10.112
I got big, and I got rich.

23:10.146 --> 23:12.646
So, now who gonna
check me, boo?

23:12.680 --> 23:14.814
Well... well...

23:14.846 --> 23:17.514
"Well... well..."

23:17.546 --> 23:19.848
Well, you ain't ready to play
with the grown-ups,

23:19.880 --> 23:22.115
so go ahead
with your little self.

23:22.147 --> 23:24.183
I wish you were my age.

23:24.215 --> 23:26.482
Then I'd check you.

23:26.516 --> 23:29.750
Everybody who you're awful to
would check you, too, boo.

23:29.783 --> 23:32.717
Well, I wish your little
cartoon dog would bite you.

23:34.916 --> 23:39.584
I wish you were little.

23:47.619 --> 23:48.953
What was that?

23:50.054 --> 23:51.121
What was what?

23:51.153 --> 23:53.122
What was...?

23:53.154 --> 23:55.087
Get out. Get out.

23:55.120 --> 23:58.789
Get that little
chocolate Hogwart out!

23:58.821 --> 24:00.756
Are you okay?
'Cause you don't look so good.

24:00.789 --> 24:02.856
No, you don't look good.

24:04.623 --> 24:06.557
No, you don't look good.

24:08.257 --> 24:10.591
That's what happens
when people don't eat carbs.

24:10.625 --> 24:12.592
They start seeing Satan.

24:12.625 --> 24:13.826
Move!

24:13.858 --> 24:15.158
- Go back to work!
- Yep.

24:15.191 --> 24:18.126
Work! Work!

24:28.194 --> 24:29.795
Morning inspiration.

24:29.828 --> 24:32.995
It is better to have money
and be brokenhearted

24:33.029 --> 24:34.997
than be broke
and brokenhearted.

24:35.030 --> 24:37.831
Let's wake up
and get this money.

24:41.164 --> 24:43.998
Come on.

24:49.700 --> 24:51.867
I need coffee.

24:55.266 --> 24:57.067
I told you watch it.

25:00.635 --> 25:03.001
I swear to God,

25:03.035 --> 25:06.937
when I see you again,
I will whup your butt!

25:06.969 --> 25:08.636
I'm not the one.

25:08.669 --> 25:10.603
- What was that about?
- Beats me.

25:13.270 --> 25:14.571
The usual.

25:14.605 --> 25:16.104
What's your usual?

25:16.137 --> 25:18.472
You playing with me, right?

25:22.072 --> 25:23.239
Here.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.040
Does that help you remember?

25:26.574 --> 25:28.008
Triple espresso with foam!

25:28.040 --> 25:30.907
You know, too much caffeine
stunts your growth.

25:30.940 --> 25:32.609
First of all, shut up.

25:32.641 --> 25:35.708
And second of all,
does all this body

25:35.742 --> 25:37.542
look like my growth
has been stunted?

25:37.576 --> 25:38.910
Depends.
How old are you?

25:38.942 --> 25:40.478
Thirty-eight.

25:40.510 --> 25:42.678
Well, then yes. Yes, it does.

25:49.545 --> 25:51.113
What the...?

25:54.013 --> 25:55.847
Oh, my God.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.981
I need to go to the hospital.

26:10.550 --> 26:12.051
Security!

26:12.083 --> 26:13.583
Homeless kid
is trying to carjack!

26:13.616 --> 26:14.718
Who's missing a bag?

26:14.751 --> 26:16.985
No! Back off!

26:17.018 --> 26:18.552
No one is touching this bag!

26:20.584 --> 26:22.985
Step away from the car.

26:23.019 --> 26:24.820
It's me, Jordan.
This is my car.

26:24.852 --> 26:26.587
I'm not losing my job
over this!

26:31.254 --> 26:33.088
Ha!

26:43.689 --> 26:45.657
Hey, little girl.

26:45.689 --> 26:47.057
Who are your parents?

26:47.090 --> 26:49.892
Um, Jordan Sanders is my mom.

26:49.925 --> 26:53.191
Uh-uh.
Jordan doesn't have a child.

26:53.225 --> 26:55.259
Well, she keeps me hidden.

26:55.292 --> 26:58.627
Just, please don't tell anyone
you saw me.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.127
You poor child.
That woman is even

27:00.159 --> 27:01.560
more horrible than I thought.

27:03.094 --> 27:05.062
She is not horrible.

27:05.095 --> 27:07.062
She just has
a very demanding lifestyle

27:07.094 --> 27:09.929
that might be giving her
a nervous breakdown.

27:11.295 --> 27:12.762
Hello?

27:12.795 --> 27:14.629
Hello, Child Services?

27:16.730 --> 27:18.663
Stop.

27:18.697 --> 27:20.531
Stop talking like that.

27:20.563 --> 27:23.232
How do you know
what I'm gonna s...

27:26.532 --> 27:28.132
...say?

27:31.734 --> 27:33.801
Where are my natural
teardrop boobs?

27:33.833 --> 27:36.867
I paid 15 Gs for those things.

27:36.900 --> 27:39.534
Why?! Why did you change?!

27:41.736 --> 27:43.603
This can't be happening.

28:13.041 --> 28:14.709
Okay.

28:33.678 --> 28:35.080
No.

28:35.112 --> 28:36.813
Not this girl.

28:38.548 --> 28:40.515
Jordan, it's me.

28:42.648 --> 28:45.515
I got all 15 of your messages.

28:50.916 --> 28:52.817
Oh, aren't you cute.

28:52.849 --> 28:54.650
Are you related to Jordan?

28:54.683 --> 28:56.617
So you see her, too?

28:58.317 --> 29:00.150
See who?

29:00.184 --> 29:01.119
The little girl.

29:02.885 --> 29:04.853
Where's Jordan?

29:04.885 --> 29:06.786
Jordan?

29:06.818 --> 29:08.488
Do you really want to know?

29:09.586 --> 29:10.953
Yeah.

29:10.986 --> 29:13.621
She's inside me.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.721
So you ate her?

29:16.754 --> 29:19.022
Is that what happened?

29:19.055 --> 29:21.589
Did you cook her
in your little Easy-Bake Oven?

29:23.023 --> 29:24.957
Jordan, hey, I'm here.

29:26.089 --> 29:27.857
Where are you?

29:27.889 --> 29:30.125
I got your dry cleaning.

29:31.824 --> 29:33.726
Did not pay me to babysit.

29:34.958 --> 29:36.758
I'm just gonna call her.

29:43.626 --> 29:46.094
She would never give her phone
to a child.

29:46.128 --> 29:48.629
Got that right.

29:48.661 --> 29:51.662
I don't know what you did
or how you did it,

29:51.695 --> 29:53.296
but you did something
to Jordan,

29:53.328 --> 29:55.796
you crazy little Chucky doll.
I'm calling the cops.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.897
Um, you had
a strawberry doughnut stain

29:57.930 --> 29:59.630
on your shirt yesterday.

29:59.664 --> 30:01.598
What the hell?

30:01.630 --> 30:04.131
One night, we were
brainstorming a dating app,

30:04.165 --> 30:05.964
and you were telling me
the lamest story

30:05.998 --> 30:07.566
about how you lost
your virginity

30:07.598 --> 30:09.665
in the back of your mom's
Dodge Ram van.

30:09.698 --> 30:11.600
But you told
your college sweetheart

30:11.632 --> 30:13.066
that he was your first.

30:13.100 --> 30:15.667
You lying thot.

30:17.034 --> 30:19.535
What in the black Jesus?

30:23.802 --> 30:26.904
This doesn't make any sense.

30:26.936 --> 30:28.636
You went to bed grown,
and then you woke up...

30:28.670 --> 30:29.803
Little.

30:29.836 --> 30:31.304
But that's for white people.

30:31.336 --> 30:32.904
'Cause black people
don't have the time.

30:32.938 --> 30:35.170
- I know!
- What happened?

30:35.204 --> 30:36.906
I can't even think of what
could possibly have happened.

30:36.938 --> 30:39.071
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I mean...

30:39.105 --> 30:41.840
how did you go
from this to this?

30:41.873 --> 30:42.907
That's...

30:45.105 --> 30:46.841
I have never seen
a better glow-up.

30:46.873 --> 30:49.940
April, can you help me
and figure this out?

30:49.974 --> 30:51.241
No, you're right.

30:51.273 --> 30:52.841
I'm... sorry.

30:52.875 --> 30:55.075
Let me just focus.

30:55.107 --> 30:57.042
Think.

30:59.109 --> 31:00.976
- I got it.
- What?

31:01.010 --> 31:02.744
Gucci Mane.

31:02.777 --> 31:04.578
He's had a better glow-up
than you.

31:04.610 --> 31:07.211
I mean, he's happy,
he's healthy, got a six-pack.

31:07.244 --> 31:08.711
He has a really nice smile,

31:08.745 --> 31:10.245
and I don't know
if those are veneers,

31:10.277 --> 31:12.178
- but people say we smile alike...
- April!

31:12.211 --> 31:14.212
Can you help me?

31:15.713 --> 31:18.047
Mm-mm.
I don't like that.

31:18.079 --> 31:21.814
- What?
- I like kids to have old-school manners, so...

31:21.846 --> 31:24.714
I'm not a child.

31:24.747 --> 31:26.948
- Mm...
- Okay.

31:32.650 --> 31:34.583
Please help me.

31:36.217 --> 31:38.685
"Please help me...

31:38.717 --> 31:40.684
Miss April, ma'am."

31:40.717 --> 31:42.218
Are you kidding me?

31:42.251 --> 31:43.786
No.

31:45.286 --> 31:48.286
Please help me...

31:48.320 --> 31:50.221
Miss April, ma'am.

31:51.721 --> 31:54.755
Okay, child.

31:54.788 --> 31:57.922
Okay, um, well,
try Benjamin Button syndrome.

31:57.956 --> 31:59.722
No.
That's when you're born old,

31:59.755 --> 32:02.089
and then you age backwards
until you're a baby again.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.822
Oh, well, my bad.

32:03.856 --> 32:06.090
I must have gotten my
magical body curses mixed up!

32:10.990 --> 32:12.592
Wait a minute.

32:12.624 --> 32:14.258
- What?
- That's it.

32:14.292 --> 32:16.593
That girl.

32:16.626 --> 32:19.126
The fire hazard
from the doughnut truck.

32:19.160 --> 32:22.761
She was waving that dumb wand
and wished I was little!

32:22.794 --> 32:24.593
Yeah, wishes don't come true.

32:24.627 --> 32:26.595
'Cause if they did,
I'd be on maternity leave

32:26.628 --> 32:28.694
with Michael B. Jordan's baby by now.

32:28.727 --> 32:30.828
Okay. So you're gonna go
to the office,

32:30.862 --> 32:34.163
stop by the truck, kidnap her
and bring her back to me, okay?

32:34.196 --> 32:35.797
I have some duct tape.

32:35.830 --> 32:37.864
We'll just starve her
until she reverses this.

32:37.897 --> 32:39.196
Yeah.

32:39.230 --> 32:41.598
Okay, or we could just ask her

32:41.630 --> 32:43.997
to use her toy wand
to make another wish,

32:44.030 --> 32:46.065
'cause that's way less
felony-ish.

32:46.097 --> 32:48.165
Just...

32:48.198 --> 32:49.667
- What are you doing?
- What?

32:49.699 --> 32:51.599
I need a glass of rosé.

32:51.632 --> 32:53.600
It's too early
for tequila shots.

32:53.633 --> 32:54.967
You're too young to drink.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.934
Relax. Just a couple of sips
to take the edge off.

33:00.701 --> 33:02.668
"Female...

33:02.702 --> 33:06.037
Gary Coleman disease."

33:06.069 --> 33:07.970
He died?

33:12.004 --> 33:13.870
Nosy neighbor.

33:13.904 --> 33:16.338
Swear to God,
you're gonna learn today.

33:16.370 --> 33:18.138
What?!

33:18.172 --> 33:19.773
Child Protective Services.

33:19.806 --> 33:21.672
Are your parents
or legal guardians home?

33:22.805 --> 33:25.340
Oh, um...

33:25.372 --> 33:27.273
April!

33:27.306 --> 33:29.007
Sorry.

33:33.608 --> 33:36.575
What you got there?
Nice rosé?

33:36.609 --> 33:38.976
So, who's in charge?

33:39.010 --> 33:40.044
Me.

33:40.077 --> 33:42.977
I have that, uh, Jordan Sanders

33:43.010 --> 33:44.844
is listed as the owner
of this apartment.

33:44.876 --> 33:47.077
Correct. Paid in full.

33:47.111 --> 33:48.779
Okurrr?

33:48.812 --> 33:50.245
You told me your name
is Jordan Sanders.

33:51.878 --> 33:53.245
I did.

33:53.279 --> 33:56.980
Well, the, um...
the other Jordan, the owner,

33:57.012 --> 33:59.580
he's, uh, my brother.

33:59.613 --> 34:01.648
Yeah. My-my dad.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.047
I'm a junior.

34:03.081 --> 34:05.316
Yeah, 'cause women
can be juniors, too.

34:05.349 --> 34:07.214
And where is your father now?

34:07.248 --> 34:08.748
Mm.

34:08.781 --> 34:10.648
My, um, father.

34:10.681 --> 34:12.049
That is a good question.

34:12.083 --> 34:13.949
- Auntie?
- Mm-hmm.

34:13.984 --> 34:16.083
Where's Daddy?

34:16.117 --> 34:20.318
You know exactly where he is.

34:20.351 --> 34:22.719
- Um...
- He's, um...

34:22.751 --> 34:25.085
- overseas.
- Space.

34:25.119 --> 34:28.587
- Uh, in a space overseas.
- Mm-hmm.

34:28.619 --> 34:30.020
Space Force.

34:30.052 --> 34:32.253
Got it.
And your mother is where?

34:32.286 --> 34:33.255
She's a crackhead.

34:34.687 --> 34:36.722
Yeah, Jordan is a crack baby.

34:36.755 --> 34:38.355
It's so sad.

34:38.387 --> 34:41.188
That's why she's so hyper
all the time.

34:41.222 --> 34:43.157
Oh, yeah.

34:45.356 --> 34:47.091
Yeah, okay,
let me just document this.

34:47.123 --> 34:50.358
Aunt and crack baby.

34:50.389 --> 34:53.024
No, no, no, but this-this is,
this is just temporary,

34:53.056 --> 34:55.958
because she's going back
to her dad soon.

34:55.993 --> 34:57.659
Mm-hmm. Very soon.

34:57.692 --> 34:59.661
- Back where?
- Home.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.061
In Hawaii with my brother.

35:06.794 --> 35:08.596
That's President Barack Obama.

35:10.260 --> 35:13.728
Hmm.
No, that's... my brother.

35:13.761 --> 35:17.063
Like, do they just
think we all look alike?

35:17.096 --> 35:19.997
Same dog and everything.
Okay, uh, and could you please

35:20.029 --> 35:21.731
tell me why you aren't
in school today?

35:21.764 --> 35:23.930
- Hmm?
- School?

35:23.963 --> 35:25.297
Girl, bye.

35:25.330 --> 35:27.098
I haven't been to school
in, like, years.

35:27.131 --> 35:28.632
No, that's not what she meant.

35:28.665 --> 35:30.165
That's not what you meant,
right?

35:30.199 --> 35:31.900
Oh, yeah,
that's not what I meant.

35:31.932 --> 35:33.166
- Mm.
- Joking.

35:33.199 --> 35:35.033
Okay, good,
because any parent or guardian

35:35.067 --> 35:37.101
of a child during the ages
of mandatory attendance

35:37.134 --> 35:38.935
shall send such child
to public school,

35:38.967 --> 35:40.335
private school
or a homeschooling program.

35:40.367 --> 35:41.968
Furthermore,
any parent or guardian

35:42.002 --> 35:43.301
who violates this code section

35:43.334 --> 35:46.135
shall be subject to fine,
imprisonment,

35:46.169 --> 35:48.636
community service
or any combination

35:48.669 --> 35:50.669
of such penalties
as the court sees fit.

35:50.703 --> 35:52.137
Say what, now?

35:52.169 --> 35:54.370
"Say what, now" is
enroll this child in school,

35:54.403 --> 35:56.004
or somebody is going to jail.

35:56.038 --> 35:57.339
That's what now say what.

35:57.372 --> 36:00.105
By "somebody," do you mean...

36:01.072 --> 36:03.206
You. That would be you.

36:03.238 --> 36:04.906
Now, the school district

36:04.940 --> 36:07.107
which Jordan
would be assigned to

36:07.139 --> 36:09.140
would be... ah...

36:09.173 --> 36:11.040
- Windsor Middle School.
- Windsor?

36:11.073 --> 36:12.674
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, hell no.

36:12.708 --> 36:14.809
Yes. Hell yes!

36:14.842 --> 36:16.841
We love that school.

36:16.874 --> 36:18.308
Enroll her there today,
and I will be

36:18.342 --> 36:19.376
checking that you do so.

36:19.408 --> 36:20.742
No.

36:20.775 --> 36:22.276
Look here, lady.

36:22.310 --> 36:25.044
I am a businesswoman,
and I have a company to run.

36:25.076 --> 36:26.311
She sells Girl Scout Cookies.

36:26.343 --> 36:27.812
She just takes it
really seriously.

36:27.844 --> 36:28.945
- I'm like...
- So I don't have time

36:28.977 --> 36:30.645
for Child Services,
and I sure don't

36:30.679 --> 36:32.245
have time for school, okay?

36:32.277 --> 36:34.812
Let me be clear.
I will have you in foster care

36:34.845 --> 36:39.080
and your goofy aunt over here
in jail if you don't. Okurrr?

36:39.114 --> 36:41.047
Yes. Okay. Yes.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.348
- No problem.
- Excellent.

36:43.380 --> 36:45.381
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm just gonna get

36:45.415 --> 36:49.149
- a video of you two together.
- Are you gonna... post this?

36:49.182 --> 36:54.184
And this apartment because...
I like the evidence.

36:54.216 --> 36:55.618
I can't go to school.

36:55.650 --> 36:57.084
I'm not going to jail.

36:58.384 --> 37:00.751
I can't believe
I have to say this.

37:00.784 --> 37:02.884
You're gonna have to be me
in the office.

37:02.918 --> 37:05.686
They're not gonna listen to me.
I'm like the homey.

37:05.718 --> 37:08.153
You have to make them listen.

37:08.185 --> 37:10.653
I'll be on the phone
in your ear,

37:10.687 --> 37:12.687
so don't say anything
I don't tell you to say,

37:12.719 --> 37:14.755
don't do anything
I don't tell you to do.

37:14.787 --> 37:16.655
So you're still in charge?

37:16.687 --> 37:18.687
Always.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.055
Just keep everyone focused
on fresh ideas,

37:21.088 --> 37:23.657
or else the whole company
is over.

37:25.055 --> 37:27.257
That just really makes me
uncomfortable.

37:27.290 --> 37:30.957
Oh. But do you know what else
is uncomfortable?

37:30.990 --> 37:32.957
Unemployment.

37:32.990 --> 37:34.725
Okay.

37:36.391 --> 37:39.192
I will agree to cover
for you at the office

37:39.226 --> 37:44.260
if you agree to promote me
to creative exec.

37:44.292 --> 37:46.760
What'd you just say?

37:46.794 --> 37:49.261
I said, um,

37:49.294 --> 37:52.261
for you to promote me
to creative exec.

37:52.295 --> 37:55.063
Well...

37:55.096 --> 37:57.230
look whose balls just dropped.

37:57.262 --> 37:59.063
I got to take what I want.

37:59.096 --> 38:01.764
- Isn't that what you said?
- Maybe.

38:02.864 --> 38:04.732
So, deal?

38:08.032 --> 38:09.633
Deal.

38:09.665 --> 38:12.299
Yes!

38:13.900 --> 38:17.101
- Just...
- You know, since I have to be you,

38:17.134 --> 38:18.667
I should probably
dress the part

38:18.700 --> 38:20.734
and borrow
some of your clothes.

38:20.767 --> 38:23.401
Your body can't fit
into my clothes.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.403
This is squats.

38:25.436 --> 38:27.403
This is Pilates.

38:27.436 --> 38:29.370
That body looks like BabyGap,

38:29.403 --> 38:31.037
Gymboree,

38:31.069 --> 38:32.804
OshKosh B'gosh to me.

38:34.137 --> 38:36.005
Ooh, you get on my nerves.

38:38.038 --> 38:40.006
Fine.

38:40.038 --> 38:41.238
Yes!

38:41.271 --> 38:42.872
This is ridiculous.

38:42.906 --> 38:44.207
Let me get this straight...

38:44.240 --> 38:46.707
you went to Target,
and you got me this?

38:46.740 --> 38:49.207
"Tarjay."
The overalls is what I got.

38:49.241 --> 38:51.408
The shirt is mine.

38:51.440 --> 38:54.907
I look great.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.876
Looking like Cookie
from "Empire."

38:58.442 --> 38:59.942
April.

38:59.975 --> 39:02.676
- Uh, you know this kid?
- Oh, hey, Vince.

39:02.710 --> 39:05.878
You know how Jordan always
asks me to do everything?

39:05.911 --> 39:07.945
- Yeah.
- Uh, well, this is her niece.

39:07.978 --> 39:09.945
Yeah, I'm watching her
while she's out of town.

39:09.978 --> 39:11.946
Oh.
That-that explains it.

39:11.979 --> 39:15.179
Yeah, we had a little confusion
with her yester... Um...

39:15.211 --> 39:17.746
Uh, did-did you guys, uh,
call Lyft?

39:17.780 --> 39:19.047
No. I got my keys.

39:19.080 --> 39:21.048
No, actually, Jordan
left these for me.

39:21.080 --> 39:22.948
Yeah.
It was part of our agreement.

39:22.981 --> 39:24.980
I-I don't think
Auntie said that.

39:25.013 --> 39:26.949
Now, stay out of
grown folks' business.

39:26.981 --> 39:29.650
Let me just take... Give me
the keys I let you play with.

39:29.682 --> 39:31.183
She's so funny.

39:31.215 --> 39:32.982
Ah, here we go.

39:39.317 --> 39:41.186
Okay, how do I close the doors?

39:44.118 --> 39:47.186
Now, how do I start the car?

39:47.219 --> 39:49.753
Just put it in electric mode.

39:49.786 --> 39:52.220
It's easier to...

39:52.253 --> 39:54.120
Whoa! Stop! April!

39:54.153 --> 39:56.054
Okay, I got it. I got it.

39:56.087 --> 39:57.954
W-Watch it! Stop!

39:57.987 --> 40:00.288
What-what are you doing?!

40:00.320 --> 40:03.255
Whoa!

40:03.289 --> 40:04.990
Okay, I got it. I got it.

40:05.022 --> 40:06.756
- No, you don't.
- Oh. No, I don't.

40:06.790 --> 40:08.992
Oh, I got...
okay, I got it now.

40:14.791 --> 40:17.291
I can't go in there. Mm-mm.

40:17.325 --> 40:19.359
You heard Agent Bea.

40:19.392 --> 40:22.194
If you're not registered today,
I'm going to county.

40:23.293 --> 40:26.193
But this place, the memories.

40:26.226 --> 40:28.194
It was so hard for me.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.061
I never felt so small.

40:34.263 --> 40:37.930
I-I know this is hard for you,
and I'm sorry,

40:37.963 --> 40:39.697
but I'm not going
to jail for you.

40:39.729 --> 40:41.996
You got to...
you're going to school.

40:42.030 --> 40:43.364
If you think I'm listening
to someone

40:43.397 --> 40:45.399
with such poor control
over their edges as you,

40:45.432 --> 40:48.831
then, girl,
you are severely mistaken.

40:48.864 --> 40:51.132
Okay. That's it.

40:55.299 --> 40:58.434
Listen, I'm the adult,
and you're the child,

40:58.466 --> 41:00.968
so when I say something,
you listen.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.101
Please.

41:03.135 --> 41:05.169
If you don't stop
embarrassing me

41:05.202 --> 41:06.969
in front of these
white people...

41:07.002 --> 41:08.336
Well, you're
embarrassing yourself.

41:08.369 --> 41:09.902
You know what?

41:11.203 --> 41:13.303
I'm sick of you.
Say one more thing.

41:13.336 --> 41:15.070
- I dare you.
- Fine.

41:15.104 --> 41:18.905
You're too fat for that skirt.

41:21.271 --> 41:23.672
You know what?

41:23.705 --> 41:26.272
If you want to take it there,
we going old-school.

41:27.840 --> 41:29.207
- What?
- Oh.

41:29.239 --> 41:31.274
- Let's go.
- I'm requesting backup.

41:31.306 --> 41:33.341
We have a BMW situation.

41:33.374 --> 41:35.374
Black mama whupping.

41:35.408 --> 41:37.410
- How you like that?
- Mm-mm!

41:42.142 --> 41:44.077
- Try me.
- Okay, see?

41:44.110 --> 41:45.844
- How you like that?
- No. You tried it.

41:45.877 --> 41:47.744
No, you tried it.
'Cause I've been looking at you

41:47.777 --> 41:49.377
like a little girl,
but you a grown-ass woman,

41:49.410 --> 41:50.878
and you gonna catch
a grown beat.

41:50.911 --> 41:53.379
Fine. 'Cause I got
this good knee back.

41:55.378 --> 41:57.779
And how about this?

41:57.812 --> 41:59.012
- April.
- Should I sell it?

41:59.047 --> 42:01.281
- Give that back to me now.
- What you gonna do if I don't?

42:03.381 --> 42:07.249
I told you not to test me!

42:07.282 --> 42:09.716
Yes!

42:09.749 --> 42:11.716
Start spanking your kids!

42:13.483 --> 42:16.117
Remind me of my mama.

42:16.150 --> 42:18.918
Can't believe
I'm back in this hellhole.

42:18.950 --> 42:20.383
That must be Principal Han.

42:20.416 --> 42:22.785
Just shut up and stay cool,
and I got it.

42:22.819 --> 42:24.318
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

42:24.351 --> 42:26.319
Nice to meet you.
Welcome, Jordan.

42:28.319 --> 42:30.887
Uh...

42:30.920 --> 42:32.020
She's just nervous.

42:32.052 --> 42:33.386
- Aw.
- Oh. Okay.

42:33.420 --> 42:35.055
Well, let's get you started.

42:35.088 --> 42:36.355
Come on.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.355
Pull it together.

Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Jordan.

44:03.105 --> 44:05.472
All right?
And here's what we're gonna do.

44:05.505 --> 44:07.839
We're gonna give her
a nice, warm...

44:07.872 --> 44:09.373
a Windsor welcome.

44:09.406 --> 44:10.940
Huh? Let's start with...
There you go.

44:10.974 --> 44:12.141
What are you doing?

44:12.174 --> 44:13.809
This is not a Windsor welcome.

44:13.841 --> 44:15.709
This is not wh-what...
what I-I taught you guys.

44:15.741 --> 44:17.309
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I blame the parents.

44:17.342 --> 44:19.976
You know what, Mr. Marshall,
I'll just take it from here.

44:20.008 --> 44:23.176
Hi, everyone.
I'm Jordan Sanders.

44:23.210 --> 44:26.844
And I want to make a few things
clear before we get started.

44:26.877 --> 44:30.312
First of all, you're meeting
the new alpha of the class.

44:30.343 --> 44:32.812
I can establish
my dominance easily,

44:32.846 --> 44:35.412
or you can make it hard
for yourself.

44:35.445 --> 44:37.079
Oh, nice pants.

44:37.112 --> 44:39.746
If the floods are a-comin'.

44:39.780 --> 44:41.714
Come on.

44:41.746 --> 44:42.880
Yeah, your clothes suck.

44:42.914 --> 44:44.448
Charlie, zip it.

44:44.481 --> 44:46.081
Thank you, Gary.

44:46.114 --> 44:49.148
It's Mr. Marshall... for you.

44:49.181 --> 44:50.482
I'm the teacher.

44:50.515 --> 44:51.881
Mm-hmm.

44:51.915 --> 44:53.749
And I'm the student.

44:55.283 --> 44:57.317
Okay, where was I?
Yeah.

44:57.350 --> 44:59.717
We're gonna skip the
"haze the new girl" thing. No.

44:59.750 --> 45:01.818
It's dull. Predictable.

45:01.852 --> 45:04.086
And I will strike back
with a vengeance

45:04.118 --> 45:05.418
like you've never known.

45:05.452 --> 45:07.152
Well, if you didn't want
to be hazed,

45:07.184 --> 45:08.952
you should have combed your hair.

45:08.986 --> 45:10.019
Okay, you know what?

45:10.052 --> 45:11.319
One more outburst,
and I'll cancel Spirit Day.

45:11.353 --> 45:13.253
I'm not joking around,
young lady.

45:13.286 --> 45:15.722
But you can't cancel
Spirit Day, Mr. Marshall.

45:15.754 --> 45:17.254
I am Spirit Day.

45:17.287 --> 45:19.354
- Oh, good Lord.
- Which reminds me...

45:19.387 --> 45:23.789
get your tickets to the hypest
school spirit pep rally ever.

45:23.821 --> 45:27.057
This year's theme
is Winchella.

45:27.089 --> 45:28.490
Windsor's
most talented students...

45:28.522 --> 45:31.190
and others that we couldn't
block from signing up

45:31.223 --> 45:32.858
because of new rules
of inclusion...

45:34.391 --> 45:36.459
...will show what makes
Windsor the best.

45:36.491 --> 45:38.459
Yeah!

45:38.492 --> 45:39.959
All right,
all right, all right.

45:39.991 --> 45:41.159
Thank you.
Pipe down. Pipe down.

45:41.191 --> 45:42.993
Open up your books.
You know what I mean?

45:43.026 --> 45:44.859
We're gonna do some learning.
Start pretending to read.

45:46.327 --> 45:50.061
Oh, boy, you know,
meeting new people.

45:50.094 --> 45:51.928
It won't always be
like this, okay?

45:51.961 --> 45:53.761
'Cause I could tell
when I met you

45:53.794 --> 45:55.262
that you are
a special young lady.

45:56.495 --> 45:58.162
You know what?

45:58.195 --> 46:00.329
- I feel like you get me.
- Really?

46:00.363 --> 46:02.031
I feel like I get you, too.

46:04.965 --> 46:06.965
So, you feeling
what I'm feeling?

46:06.998 --> 46:08.798
You want to quit?

46:08.831 --> 46:11.365
I think about
quitting every day.

46:11.398 --> 46:14.200
But I can't, because I have
a responsibility.

46:14.232 --> 46:15.766
Wh-What are you feeling?

46:17.167 --> 46:20.067
Oh. No, I'm not
feeling that at all.

46:20.100 --> 46:22.934
I'm a... I'm an adult...
adult man.

46:22.968 --> 46:24.735
And you should have a seat.

46:24.768 --> 46:27.769
Okay, Mr. Hard to Get.

46:27.801 --> 46:29.369
I see you.

46:30.770 --> 46:32.770
Mm-hmm.

46:32.803 --> 46:35.171
Go ahead and sit down.

46:35.204 --> 46:37.971
It's time.
Time to sit down.

46:38.003 --> 46:40.804
Just don't...
you know, just look...

46:40.838 --> 46:42.206
look-look the other way.

46:42.238 --> 46:43.839
Look the way... look the...
look up there.

46:43.873 --> 46:45.172
Look away from me.

46:45.205 --> 46:47.905
- Teach me something.
- Don't...

46:50.407 --> 46:54.408
So, uh, what are
us kids into these days?

46:54.440 --> 46:57.375
I'm looking for
the next big thing, you know.

47:01.042 --> 47:03.010
Uh, excuse you.

47:03.042 --> 47:05.176
Cutting without tipping
is rude.

47:07.877 --> 47:09.511
Ugh.

47:11.177 --> 47:12.811
Really?

47:12.844 --> 47:14.345
You feed this to children?

47:14.379 --> 47:16.145
- To eat?
- Mm-hmm.

47:16.178 --> 47:18.979
Postmates.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.781
You got this, Jordan.
You're grown.

47:28.815 --> 47:30.449
You're successful.

47:30.482 --> 47:32.882
These kids can't hurt you.

47:52.519 --> 47:54.253
Next table.

47:54.286 --> 47:57.754
Oh, my... She's coming over.

47:57.788 --> 47:58.955
Oh, really?

47:58.988 --> 48:00.922
- It's like that, sister?
- Mm-hmm.

48:00.955 --> 48:03.355
Okay. Fine.

48:06.890 --> 48:08.524
Come on. Come here.

48:08.557 --> 48:10.124
Hey.

48:12.024 --> 48:13.725
Come here.

48:15.258 --> 48:17.159
Oh.

48:19.159 --> 48:20.860
Never thought I'd say thank you

48:20.893 --> 48:23.260
to anybody offering me
the worst table in the house,

48:23.292 --> 48:25.459
but, um, thank you.

48:25.493 --> 48:28.261
- Sure.
- Mm-hmm.

48:28.293 --> 48:31.428
Why do you guys need
a "safe space" for lunch?

48:34.529 --> 48:36.496
Stop.

48:36.529 --> 48:38.930
- It's becoming clear.
- Three years ago,

48:38.963 --> 48:41.231
I answered too many questions
correctly. Friend Zone.

48:41.263 --> 48:43.230
I didn't have any new clothes

48:43.263 --> 48:45.897
at the start of school
one year.

48:45.931 --> 48:47.499
Over.

48:47.532 --> 48:49.999
I don't even know why
I'm he-he-h-here.

48:58.967 --> 49:00.767
Who did this to me?

49:00.800 --> 49:02.234
You better show yourself!

49:04.835 --> 49:06.902
D-Don't-don't worry.

49:06.934 --> 49:09.802
No one gets s-s-stuck
in the Friend Zone forever.

49:09.836 --> 49:12.904
You're cute for thinking that.
Keep living.

49:12.936 --> 49:14.770
No. He's right.

49:14.803 --> 49:17.104
Once everyone sees our talent
at the pep rally,

49:17.136 --> 49:19.370
we can finally get out
of the Friend Zone

49:19.404 --> 49:21.439
and be in the center of it all.

49:21.472 --> 49:23.205
We'll be cool with everyone.

49:23.238 --> 49:24.206
It's gonna be very

49:24.238 --> 49:27.540
"wh-what's up, what's up?"
in the hall.

49:27.572 --> 49:30.340
Who does that Jasmine girl
think she is?

49:30.373 --> 49:32.874
J-J-Ja-Ja-Jasmine, sh-she's...

49:32.907 --> 49:35.275
Sing it, Isaac.

49:35.307 --> 49:38.242
♪ She's so ♪

49:38.276 --> 49:40.777
♪ Perfect. ♪

49:40.809 --> 49:42.208
He doesn't stutter
when he sings.

49:42.241 --> 49:43.844
I see.

49:51.878 --> 49:53.879
- These answers better be right.
- Duh.

49:53.912 --> 49:56.212
What is wrong with this school?

49:57.912 --> 49:58.913
What is it?

49:58.946 --> 50:00.479
Guys, check this out!

50:00.512 --> 50:04.147
"When you can't afford
a blowout or new sneakers"?

50:04.181 --> 50:06.015
Look at it.

50:07.547 --> 50:09.815
Order for Sanders.

50:09.848 --> 50:11.314
That's me.

50:11.347 --> 50:13.082
All right.

50:14.249 --> 50:16.216
Thank you.

50:17.383 --> 50:19.250
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

50:19.283 --> 50:21.184
There's no Postmates
in school, okay?

50:21.216 --> 50:22.483
Sorry.

50:22.517 --> 50:25.485
You know what?
I am done chasing you.

50:25.517 --> 50:29.152
A man who finds a wife
finds a good thing.

50:29.186 --> 50:31.121
That's Bible, Gary.

50:33.952 --> 50:35.987
What a weird little girl.

50:36.020 --> 50:38.120
April, you have to
come pick me up.

50:38.154 --> 50:39.921
These kids are demons.

50:39.954 --> 50:43.054
Jordan, I have my first
meeting, and I am freaking out.

50:43.088 --> 50:44.922
I-I don't think I can do this.

50:44.955 --> 50:46.257
Calm down.

50:46.289 --> 50:48.222
Put me in your ear,
like, on Bluetooth.

50:52.823 --> 50:54.190
- Hey, April.
- Hey.

50:54.224 --> 50:55.491
I heard...

50:55.524 --> 50:57.958
Okay. Uh...

50:57.991 --> 51:00.126
- I heard Jordan was sick.
- Yeah, she's...

51:00.159 --> 51:02.492
definitely gonna be out
for, like, a day or two.

51:02.526 --> 51:04.126
You ready to hold it down
without her?

51:04.158 --> 51:05.460
Mm-hmm.

51:05.492 --> 51:08.360
All right, well,
I'll see you in the meeting.

51:08.393 --> 51:10.095
And I'm sure
you're gonna shine.

51:11.394 --> 51:13.394
You shining already.

51:13.427 --> 51:15.428
Okay.

51:18.062 --> 51:19.429
Okay.

51:19.462 --> 51:21.229
Command their attention.

51:21.263 --> 51:22.296
- VR goggles...
- Good idea.

51:22.329 --> 51:24.064
Oh, I think... I think
we should do the... Right?

51:24.096 --> 51:27.231
Guys, I need to command
your attention, please.

51:27.263 --> 51:30.399
Uh, can we all just quiet down
and focus, please.

51:35.132 --> 51:36.400
Thanks.

51:36.432 --> 51:38.266
Where's Jordan?

51:38.300 --> 51:40.201
Um, she's under the weather.

51:40.234 --> 51:43.067
So I'm here
just filling in for her.

51:43.101 --> 51:44.568
Is that why
you're wearing her clothes?

51:44.601 --> 51:46.402
These aren't her... This?

51:46.435 --> 51:48.969
The-These aren't her clothes.
These are my clothes.

51:49.002 --> 51:50.102
You don't wear cheetah.

51:50.135 --> 51:52.135
I always wear cheetah.

51:52.169 --> 51:54.104
Jordan is never sick.

51:54.137 --> 51:56.571
She must really be
on her deathbed.

51:56.603 --> 51:59.571
Oh, which would be
a developer's, uh, dream.

51:59.604 --> 52:02.471
Yeah.

52:02.505 --> 52:04.206
Was that Preston?

52:04.238 --> 52:07.272
Oh, if he wasn't so talented,
I'd fire his butt.

52:07.306 --> 52:09.040
And he also has a good butt.

52:09.073 --> 52:10.073
He does.

52:10.106 --> 52:11.174
April's right.

52:11.207 --> 52:12.506
We need to focus.

52:12.539 --> 52:13.973
Thank you, Preston.

52:14.007 --> 52:15.942
No. No. Uh-uh.

52:15.974 --> 52:17.574
JSI is going under.

52:17.608 --> 52:19.874
I'm gonna need Melissa
to shut up.

52:19.908 --> 52:21.809
- I need to get a new job.
- No, you don't.

52:21.842 --> 52:23.242
I'm looking at
Jordan's Facebook right now.

52:23.276 --> 52:24.942
- Don't check it.
- This is off the rails.

52:24.975 --> 52:26.476
You have to show them
you can be crazy.

52:26.510 --> 52:29.477
- Y'all, I can be crazy, so... chill.
- Shoot. Okay.

52:29.510 --> 52:32.111
Do it now,
or you'll never get control.

52:32.144 --> 52:33.811
- Do what?
- Do it now!

52:33.845 --> 52:35.146
I said listen up!

52:37.878 --> 52:40.546
You want to see crazy?!
I can show you crazy!

52:42.447 --> 52:43.514
Uh...

52:49.981 --> 52:51.815
What, y'all put bricks
in here or something?

52:51.849 --> 52:53.849
Y'all recycle a lot. Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

52:53.882 --> 52:55.315
JSI is doing fine.

52:55.349 --> 52:57.484
We all have jobs.
Let's do... Let's innovate!

52:57.517 --> 52:59.317
We're JS Innovations.

52:59.350 --> 53:01.251
I'm in charge.

53:01.284 --> 53:04.185
Oh, God, this is so hard.

53:06.285 --> 53:09.353
I don't know
what that was, and...

53:11.152 --> 53:13.120
What are you wearing?

53:13.152 --> 53:16.288
You look like a cheerleader
for the Migos right now.

53:17.887 --> 53:19.487
This is the worst day ever.

53:19.520 --> 53:23.155
I'm gonna need a stiff drink
and some clothes that fit.

53:26.055 --> 53:28.122
Corner table for two.

53:28.155 --> 53:29.322
Right this way.

53:32.924 --> 53:34.557
Can I start you
with something to drink?

53:34.590 --> 53:36.457
Oh, yes. I'll have a glass
of rosé, please.

53:36.491 --> 53:37.859
Scotch on the rocks.

53:37.892 --> 53:39.492
Two rocks.
And I mean two.

53:39.524 --> 53:41.058
If there's three,
it's going back.

53:42.292 --> 53:45.427
How cute are you?

53:47.259 --> 53:49.560
- Are you in charge?
- Mm-hmm.

53:49.594 --> 53:52.295
Let's get real.
This black card's in charge.

53:55.295 --> 53:57.596
- What is this?
- The kids' menu.

53:57.628 --> 54:00.029
Would you like this kid's foot
up your...

54:00.063 --> 54:01.529
Oh, she'll have
a Shirley Temple.

54:01.562 --> 54:03.496
Porterhouse, rare.

54:04.930 --> 54:06.431
Right away.

54:06.464 --> 54:07.865
Thank you.

54:07.897 --> 54:09.331
Any leads on
the doughnut truck?

54:09.364 --> 54:12.431
The city doesn't provide
contact info for the trucks,

54:12.464 --> 54:15.600
and since someone took them
off our route...

54:15.632 --> 54:18.201
- Damn it.
- But...

54:18.234 --> 54:20.000
these trucks need to be
inspected every year,

54:20.032 --> 54:22.433
and they can't just go
to any auto repair shop.

54:22.467 --> 54:26.067
So I narrowed it down to a
dozen repair shops in the city

54:26.100 --> 54:27.334
that handle
food truck inspections.

54:27.367 --> 54:29.002
And I have an intern
making calls,

54:29.034 --> 54:30.535
so we should have a lead soon.

54:30.568 --> 54:33.236
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

54:33.269 --> 54:35.069
Yes. Thank you.

54:36.570 --> 54:38.038
Mm.

54:38.071 --> 54:40.103
This is heaven.

54:40.136 --> 54:42.104
- I would... You know.
- Mm-hmm.

54:42.137 --> 54:43.505
Mm.

54:43.538 --> 54:45.271
Mm-mm-mm!

54:45.304 --> 54:47.839
Oh, it's not all bad
at your school, though,

54:47.873 --> 54:49.473
'cause can we talk about
Mr. Marshall,

54:49.506 --> 54:51.473
the other white meat?

54:51.505 --> 54:53.508
Oh, girl, I was thinking about
going back to pork.

54:53.541 --> 54:54.842
Hello. Oink, oink.

54:54.875 --> 54:56.274
Him fine as swine.

54:56.307 --> 54:58.241
I'd like to
teach him some things.

54:58.274 --> 55:00.843
What are you gonna teach him
in that scrawny, flat body?

55:00.875 --> 55:02.209
Well, at least I'm not dried up

55:02.242 --> 55:03.943
like a creek hit by a drought
down there.

55:03.976 --> 55:06.009
Please stop.

55:06.043 --> 55:08.978
Just a dusty bed of rocks
where water once flowed.

55:09.010 --> 55:11.010
First, that's not...
it's not dusty.

55:11.043 --> 55:13.478
Anyways, what's up
with you and Preston?

55:13.510 --> 55:15.477
Making puppy dog eyes
at him all day.

55:15.510 --> 55:17.212
We're just friends.

55:17.246 --> 55:19.579
Well, yeah, 'cause you're
too scared to get at him.

55:19.612 --> 55:22.480
You see, that's your problem
with work and men.

55:22.512 --> 55:24.113
You can't close the deal.

55:24.146 --> 55:25.447
Wh-What about you?

55:25.480 --> 55:28.081
You hire employees
but don't trust them.

55:28.114 --> 55:31.014
You meet people
but don't make friends.

55:31.047 --> 55:33.616
You date, and you don't commit.

55:33.648 --> 55:35.882
Committing is overrated.

55:35.916 --> 55:37.383
I'm a boss.

55:37.415 --> 55:39.417
I can't be heartbroken.

55:39.449 --> 55:42.451
Men want me to be just like
a Mary J. Blige song.

55:42.484 --> 55:44.585
Just down without them.

55:44.617 --> 55:47.117
But I'm too strong
for that mess.

55:47.150 --> 55:49.220
Okay.

55:51.585 --> 55:53.853
Wait. Oh, can you actually
just leave the whole bottle?

55:53.886 --> 55:55.919
'Cause she left her card,
right?

55:55.953 --> 55:57.555
She comes from money.

55:58.954 --> 56:00.288
What are you doing?

56:00.321 --> 56:02.488
Mm, nothing.

56:02.520 --> 56:04.355
Why are you sniffing
and holding my glass?

56:04.389 --> 56:06.423
My hand is not on your glass.

56:06.456 --> 56:08.123
I literally see
your baby fingers right now

56:08.156 --> 56:09.390
gripping my glass.

56:09.423 --> 56:11.390
Well, I think
you're seeing things.

56:11.423 --> 56:13.924
Jordan, no drinking.
I mean it.

56:13.957 --> 56:17.025
You got my aunties
over there trippin'. Stop.

56:17.058 --> 56:20.125
Relax. I'm fine.

56:20.158 --> 56:22.026
She's fine.
It's a game we play.

56:22.058 --> 56:23.558
I'm drinking.
You're drinking.

56:23.592 --> 56:25.426
One, two, three, drink.

Well, see you at

59:16.262 --> 59:18.863
So, how's it look?

Um...

59:22.663 --> 59:25.163
it'll get you

59:25.197 --> 59:27.097
You like this movie?

59:27.130 --> 59:29.130
Yeah, I love it.

59:29.164 --> 59:32.666
Work! Work! Work! Work! Work!

59:32.698 --> 59:35.267
Yes. Come through.

59:35.299 --> 59:38.967

are canceled!

- Are you serious?
- Now suffer!

59:41.632 --> 59:43.001
Really?

59:43.034 --> 59:44.467
Evillene was a boss.

59:44.500 --> 59:46.601
I learned so much about
running a company from her.

59:46.635 --> 59:48.935
We haven't had
a lunch hour in six months!

59:48.968 --> 59:50.402
That explains a lot.

59:50.436 --> 59:53.536
But I wasn't always
this hard on people.

59:53.569 --> 59:58.404
When I was first this age,
I stopped being open and kind.

59:58.436 --> 01:00:02.537
Every time I tried to fit in,
kids would just beat me down.

01:00:02.571 --> 01:00:07.005
Make fun of me, bully me.

01:00:07.038 --> 01:00:09.639
At that point,
I just gave up on people.

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:12.607
It hurt too much to care.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.374
Anyways, when I grew up,

01:00:17.407 --> 01:00:20.375
I guess I just
attacked people first

01:00:20.409 --> 01:00:22.609
before they could attack me.

01:00:28.342 --> 01:00:30.510

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:32.478

it's hard out here for girls.

01:00:32.511 --> 01:00:35.177
It's like, you get one shot
if you're lucky,

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:38.312
and if you don't hit
the bull's-eye,

01:00:38.346 --> 01:00:40.614
people will drag you.

01:00:45.446 --> 01:00:47.448

Wh-What I'm trying
to understand is...

01:02:56.241 --> 01:03:00.207
why would you be in Jordan's
apartment watching some...

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.510
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:03:03.542 --> 01:03:05.343
I know exactly who you are.

01:03:05.375 --> 01:03:06.642
You do?

01:03:06.675 --> 01:03:08.243
Well, sure.

01:03:08.277 --> 01:03:09.544
Man, listen, listen,

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:11.078
everything's gonna be okay,
all right?

01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:12.378
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be fine.

01:03:12.409 --> 01:03:13.944
We're gonna figure this out
together.

01:03:13.977 --> 01:03:16.178
It's-it's gonna take
some adjusting, and...

01:03:16.211 --> 01:03:17.379
To be honest,
I'd always imagined

01:03:17.412 --> 01:03:18.978
having my own kids
at first, but...

01:03:19.011 --> 01:03:21.679
I guess, when God sends you
a child to love,

01:03:21.712 --> 01:03:23.246
it doesn't matter
where it comes from.

01:03:25.113 --> 01:03:27.547
Wait, what the hell
are you talking about?

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.715
This is why Jordan
was so closed off to me.

01:03:29.748 --> 01:03:32.215
She was embarrassed to tell me
she's a single mom.

01:03:32.247 --> 01:03:34.381
Oh, God, no.

01:03:34.414 --> 01:03:36.548
- No, no, no, no, no. Get out.
- You know what?

01:03:36.582 --> 01:03:37.682
- I think you better go. You should go.
- Go!

01:03:37.715 --> 01:03:39.482
Look at you. You're so cute,
like a little doll.

01:03:39.515 --> 01:03:40.983
We can go together,
but... you got to go.

01:03:41.016 --> 01:03:42.050
Just lovable. Look at...

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:44.685
No, no,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:03:44.718 --> 01:03:46.551
Oh, my God, you're so strong.

01:03:46.583 --> 01:03:47.685
Key.

01:03:47.719 --> 01:03:49.619
You sound just like your mama.

01:03:49.652 --> 01:03:51.252
That... that tough exterior
just trying to...

01:03:51.285 --> 01:03:52.452
just trying to protect
what's on the inside.

01:03:52.485 --> 01:03:54.252
Look, you ain't
got to do that no more.

01:03:54.286 --> 01:03:56.154
- Just give me the key.
- Okay? I'm here for you.

01:03:56.187 --> 01:03:58.020
All right?

01:03:58.053 --> 01:03:59.988
And look, don't-don't...
Listen, don't...

01:04:00.021 --> 01:04:01.422
don't tell your mom, all right?

01:04:01.455 --> 01:04:04.287
Just-just give me a chance
to explain, okay?

01:04:04.321 --> 01:04:06.588
I'll-I'll be back, all right?

01:04:06.621 --> 01:04:09.122
I'll be back. Daddy's home.

01:04:09.155 --> 01:04:11.323
Mama's home, too.

01:04:12.357 --> 01:04:14.456
I'm on Hinge, Tinder
and Christian Mingle.

01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:20.358
So, now what?

01:04:20.391 --> 01:04:23.325
I hate to say it,
but I have to go back to work.

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:24.693
And you have to go back to...

01:04:24.725 --> 01:04:26.527
No, no, no.
Please don't say it, April.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:27.993
To school.

01:04:28.026 --> 01:04:29.660
We can't risk it
with Agent Bea.

01:04:29.692 --> 01:04:32.593
You don't understand
what school was like.

01:04:32.627 --> 01:04:35.128
Or is like.

01:04:35.161 --> 01:04:38.495
The way this Jasmine girl makes
people feel about themselves?

01:04:38.528 --> 01:04:41.696
She's mean, cruel, a bully.

01:04:41.729 --> 01:04:44.363
Doesn't care about
anyone's feelings.

01:04:45.731 --> 01:04:48.563
Yeah, I can't imagine
what that's like.

01:04:48.596 --> 01:04:51.998
You're not talking about me,
are you?

01:04:52.032 --> 01:04:55.232
There's probably a reason
why you became this Jordan.

01:04:55.265 --> 01:04:57.466
You know, maybe you have to do

01:04:57.498 --> 01:05:00.167
something differently
at this age.

01:05:00.199 --> 01:05:02.135
Botox?

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:05.734
I'm just saying...

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:09.134
you have a chance
anyone would kill for.

01:05:09.167 --> 01:05:12.069
You get to be a child again.

01:05:12.103 --> 01:05:15.636
So, knowing what you know now,
what would you do different?

01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:20.605
I'd stun on those kids.

01:05:23.105 --> 01:05:24.472

Yeah!

01:06:51.122 --> 01:06:53.624
Oh, except for you, Becca.
You suck.

01:06:55.391 --> 01:06:57.191

01:06:57.224 --> 01:06:58.191
Next.

01:06:58.224 --> 01:07:00.092
S-Sure you don't want
to join us, Jordan?

01:07:00.124 --> 01:07:02.524
Yeah. We could really use
one more dancer.

01:07:02.557 --> 01:07:04.359
- You could freestyle.
- No way.

01:07:04.393 --> 01:07:07.393
I am never going on that stage
and sharing myself again.

01:07:07.426 --> 01:07:10.227
I landed butt first in a stack
full of cardboard boxes

01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:11.461
the last time I tried that.

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:12.527
Next!

01:07:16.127 --> 01:07:17.695
Hi.

01:07:20.362 --> 01:07:23.229
Okay. So, what's your talent?

01:07:23.262 --> 01:07:25.730

Okay, so...
sometimes he gets nervous.

01:07:45.066 --> 01:07:47.167
B-But trust us, he's amazing.

01:07:47.201 --> 01:07:49.435
And then we do this, like,
really hype dance,

01:07:49.467 --> 01:07:50.735
- and we back him up.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:07:50.769 --> 01:07:53.269
So we'll just skip to the part
where we dance.

01:07:53.301 --> 01:07:55.236
Music.

01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:59.504

01:08:05.771 --> 01:08:07.071
Oh!

01:08:10.239 --> 01:08:12.172
Okay, that's enough.
You're in.

01:08:12.205 --> 01:08:13.706
See you all at Winchella.

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.307
Awesome. Thank you.

01:08:15.339 --> 01:08:17.174
You guys are gonna be
blown away.

01:08:17.206 --> 01:08:19.041
We already are.

01:08:19.075 --> 01:08:20.975
Yes.

01:08:22.408 --> 01:08:24.076
See?

01:08:24.109 --> 01:08:26.576
See what?
That was a disaster.

01:08:26.609 --> 01:08:29.309
It wasn't as great as we-we-we
thought it was gonna be.

01:08:29.343 --> 01:08:32.310
But that's okay. We'll totally
kill it at-at-at Winchella.

01:08:32.343 --> 01:08:33.377
Right?

01:08:33.411 --> 01:08:35.045
- Yeah.
- Are you crazy?

01:08:35.078 --> 01:08:37.212
She just let you into Winchella
just to make fun of you.

01:08:37.245 --> 01:08:39.746
I don't know.
I mean, she seemed pretty nice.

01:08:39.779 --> 01:08:41.246
Yeah, plus they won't laugh

01:08:41.278 --> 01:08:44.013
when they really see
what we're about.

01:08:44.046 --> 01:08:46.381
- Forget showing who you really are.
- Yeah! -

01:08:46.412 --> 01:08:48.279
That is social suicide.

01:08:48.312 --> 01:08:50.247
- Huh?
- You know what?

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:52.180
Let me teach you
how to be somebody else.

01:08:52.214 --> 01:08:54.582
Somebody that a bully
wouldn't dare to make fun of,

01:08:54.613 --> 01:08:57.548
because you're living a life
that they can only dream of.

01:08:57.581 --> 01:08:59.448
And that can't happen here.

01:08:59.481 --> 01:09:01.082
- Oh...
- I-I-I've... I-I've never skipped

01:09:01.115 --> 01:09:02.684
a second of school
in my whole life.

01:09:02.716 --> 01:09:05.185
Mm-hmm. And, uh,
where has that gotten you?

01:09:06.283 --> 01:09:07.618
Let's go.

01:09:17.185 --> 01:09:19.287
Whoa.

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:21.587
Wow.

01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.421
- Wow.
- Whoa.

01:09:24.453 --> 01:09:26.621
You live here?

01:09:26.654 --> 01:09:29.122
- This is so c-c-cool.
- Whoa.

01:09:29.154 --> 01:09:32.322
- Is this what having money feels like?
- Wow.

01:09:32.356 --> 01:09:34.790
Okay, guys, now, focus.
This is about showing Jasmine

01:09:34.823 --> 01:09:37.225
and the rest of the school
what they're missing out on

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:39.024
by not being friends
with you guys.

01:09:39.057 --> 01:09:41.791
So we have to look like
we're having the most fun.

01:09:41.823 --> 01:09:44.459
Isn't it easier to...
just to really have fun?

01:09:44.491 --> 01:09:46.091
Ain't nobody got time
for reality.

01:09:46.125 --> 01:09:48.160
We're talking about
the Internet.

01:09:48.193 --> 01:09:49.560
Okay.

01:09:49.593 --> 01:09:52.227
Um, HomeGirl, a vibe, please.

01:09:52.261 --> 01:09:54.328
HomeGirl doesn't know you.

01:09:54.361 --> 01:09:56.561
Voice recognition denied.

01:09:56.593 --> 01:09:59.261
I said,
"HomeGirl, a vibe, please!"

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:00.528
All right.

01:10:00.562 --> 01:10:02.196
Playing a vibe.

01:10:02.228 --> 01:10:04.196
Okay.

01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:08.531

of you guys looking like you.

01:12:08.232 --> 01:12:10.733
- Look at all these likes.
- Wow.

01:12:10.765 --> 01:12:13.433
Even Jasmine
kitty-cat-heart-eyed our story.

01:12:13.466 --> 01:12:16.600
I mean, I still think
Winchella would have been fun.

01:12:16.634 --> 01:12:20.368
One wrong move, and then
you lose all your followers.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.669
Forget Winchella.

01:12:22.702 --> 01:12:24.837
She's right.
We can't mess this up.

01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:27.104
I've changed your life
for the better.

01:12:27.136 --> 01:12:28.603
My work here is done.

01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:30.603
Your Lyft is downstairs.

01:12:30.637 --> 01:12:33.472
Thank you. - Bye.

01:12:35.304 --> 01:12:36.839
What are you doing here?

01:12:36.871 --> 01:12:38.705
I don't know, okay?

01:12:38.739 --> 01:12:40.439
I-I-I... I walked into a store,

01:12:40.472 --> 01:12:42.507
there was pink everywhere,
and the next thing I know,

01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.373
I'm handing over
my credit card, and...

01:12:45.406 --> 01:12:48.107
You... you probably don't
play with toys, huh?

01:12:48.141 --> 01:12:50.675
I should have thought
about this.

01:12:50.707 --> 01:12:52.709
Look, I'm-I'm nervous, okay?
I just want to make

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.575
a good impression
on you and your mom.

01:12:54.609 --> 01:12:56.443
- Wh-Where's Jordan?
- Business trip.

01:12:56.475 --> 01:12:58.843
Look, do you want me to send
her a message or something?

01:12:58.876 --> 01:13:01.477
N-No. I-I mean... yes.

01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:04.111
There's just
so much I want to say.

01:13:04.143 --> 01:13:07.179
But your mama just makes it
so hard to talk face-to-face.

01:13:08.644 --> 01:13:11.612
Just... come in.

01:13:15.513 --> 01:13:16.714
Hey.

01:13:16.745 --> 01:13:18.413
- What is happening?
- Hey.

01:13:18.447 --> 01:13:20.215
N-No, n-no.

01:13:20.247 --> 01:13:22.315
Yo, these are dope.

01:13:22.347 --> 01:13:24.514
Uh, thanks.

01:13:24.547 --> 01:13:25.647
So, you ready?

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.216
Uh-huh. Uh, no.

01:13:28.248 --> 01:13:30.648
I can't do it. I can't run
another pitch meeting.

01:13:30.682 --> 01:13:32.549
And it's fine.
It's good. I'm good.

01:13:32.583 --> 01:13:35.351
April, you have so many
dope ideas. Look at this.

01:13:35.383 --> 01:13:38.250
You know, you could really
bring a team together.

01:13:38.284 --> 01:13:39.685
I can't do it like Jordan.

01:13:39.717 --> 01:13:41.384
Yes, thank God.

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.651
She never lets us get
our ideas out, and that's...

01:13:43.684 --> 01:13:45.152
that's including you.

01:13:45.186 --> 01:13:46.487
You're right.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.154
So, what you gonna do?

01:13:48.187 --> 01:13:51.654
I-I guess I'm gonna run it...
like me?

01:13:51.686 --> 01:13:53.255
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear
what you said.

01:13:53.287 --> 01:13:54.554
I said I'm gonna run it
like me.

01:13:54.587 --> 01:13:56.521
I'm sorry,
I-I couldn't hear you.

01:13:56.555 --> 01:13:58.288
- I'm gonna go up there...
- Uh-huh.

01:13:58.322 --> 01:14:00.622
...and run that pitch meeting
like April, who's me.

01:14:00.656 --> 01:14:02.256
- Uh-huh.
- And I'm gonna kill it.

01:14:02.288 --> 01:14:03.790
- You gonna kill it?
- Yes! I'm gonna... up there,

01:14:03.823 --> 01:14:05.324
- I'm gonna kill it.
- You gonna kill up there.

01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:06.590
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:14:06.624 --> 01:14:08.158
April, when I first heard

01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:09.823
that you were leading
the pitch meeting,

01:14:09.857 --> 01:14:11.592
I really only came
for the bagels.

01:14:12.857 --> 01:14:14.626
But this is the first time

01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:17.127
I feel like my pitch
has actually been heard.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:19.193
Tell me about it.

01:14:19.226 --> 01:14:21.527
I haven't even taken one
of my antianxiety pills today.

01:14:21.559 --> 01:14:23.460
I mean, look at us.
I mean, this is nice, right?

01:14:23.494 --> 01:14:24.794
I mean, this is, like,
a very positive,

01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:26.194
like, A.A. meeting, right?

01:14:26.226 --> 01:14:27.894
Yeah. Right?

01:14:27.928 --> 01:14:29.862
Well, thank you, guys, so much.

01:14:29.896 --> 01:14:32.662
I-I'm so glad this is fun.

01:14:32.694 --> 01:14:34.496
But I have to be honest.

01:14:34.530 --> 01:14:36.231
The ideas
just aren't there yet.

01:14:36.262 --> 01:14:38.130
We got to do better.

01:14:38.163 --> 01:14:39.630
Let's hear 'em!

01:14:39.664 --> 01:14:41.631
Ready to make that money!

01:14:41.663 --> 01:14:43.197
- Uh...
- Is-is that...?

01:14:43.230 --> 01:14:44.698
Mr. Connor.

01:14:44.732 --> 01:14:46.799
- How long have you been here?
- I don't know.

01:14:46.832 --> 01:14:48.800
I never learned
how to tell time.

01:14:48.832 --> 01:14:50.565
Someone else does time for me.

01:14:50.598 --> 01:14:53.533
Well, the-the pitch
isn't until tomorrow.

01:14:53.566 --> 01:14:55.267
Where's Jordan?

01:14:56.633 --> 01:14:58.267
Jordan...

01:14:58.301 --> 01:14:59.601
Can I see it?

01:14:59.635 --> 01:15:02.336
She's at home...

01:15:02.369 --> 01:15:04.903
dealing with some stuff...

01:15:04.936 --> 01:15:06.703
in her private area.

01:15:06.736 --> 01:15:08.469
That's... Whew!

01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:10.369
It is on fire.

01:15:10.403 --> 01:15:13.204
Mm. Got a hotbox down there?

01:15:13.237 --> 01:15:15.605
I've dealt with a few o' those.

01:15:15.637 --> 01:15:17.505
You said you dealt
with a... a few?

01:15:17.538 --> 01:15:19.539
So, what have you got?

01:15:19.571 --> 01:15:22.572
Come on,
the suspense is killing me.

01:15:25.273 --> 01:15:27.341
So, what's your plan
for my mom?

01:15:27.373 --> 01:15:30.507
There is no plan.

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.207
I enjoy spending time with her.

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.275
Well, that can't be it.

01:15:34.308 --> 01:15:36.610
There's got to be some...
angle.

01:15:36.643 --> 01:15:38.577
Well, there isn't.

01:15:39.809 --> 01:15:43.144
I see her, you know?

01:15:43.177 --> 01:15:45.612
I mean, she's only tough
so no one can hurt her.

01:15:45.645 --> 01:15:48.378
But on the low...

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:50.512
your mom is really,
really silly.

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:52.412
Like, I can't even tell you
how many times

01:15:52.445 --> 01:15:54.446
I caught her goofing
and dancing around here

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.846
when she thought
no one was watching.

01:15:55.878 --> 01:15:58.580
Mm-hmm.

01:15:58.612 --> 01:16:01.648
All right.
Then let's get real.

01:16:01.681 --> 01:16:02.915
Mm.

01:16:02.948 --> 01:16:04.449
You're here for her money, huh?

01:16:04.482 --> 01:16:05.516
What?

01:16:05.548 --> 01:16:06.581
Mm-hmm.

01:16:06.614 --> 01:16:08.615
No, I'm not here for her money.

01:16:08.648 --> 01:16:11.283
I, uh...
I do pretty well for myself.

01:16:11.316 --> 01:16:13.650
You're a starving artist.

01:16:13.683 --> 01:16:15.684
Yes, I am an artist.

01:16:15.716 --> 01:16:18.284
Your mom only assumes
I'm starving.

01:16:18.318 --> 01:16:19.685
I actually just had
a great show

01:16:19.717 --> 01:16:21.251
at the Studio Museum in Harlem.

01:16:23.818 --> 01:16:28.286
I am surprised that I...

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.154
my mom didn't know that
about you.

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:33.588
Oh. I mean, how could she?

01:16:33.619 --> 01:16:35.387
Right?

01:16:35.421 --> 01:16:37.256
She never asks me anything,
and...

01:16:37.288 --> 01:16:39.588
she definitely doesn't
tell me much about herself.

01:16:39.621 --> 01:16:41.823
I mean, I...
I didn't know about you.

01:16:43.255 --> 01:16:44.789
Then...

01:16:44.822 --> 01:16:47.756
if she's so tough,
then why are you here?

01:16:50.958 --> 01:16:53.292
I care about your mom.

01:16:54.491 --> 01:16:56.658
To be that guarded...

01:16:56.691 --> 01:16:59.859
it has to be lonely.

01:16:59.893 --> 01:17:01.927
I just want her to know that,

01:17:01.959 --> 01:17:04.728
even though she may feel
like she's on her own,

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:08.162
no matter what,
I truly have her back.

01:17:10.527 --> 01:17:13.829
That... is very nice to hear.

01:17:13.862 --> 01:17:15.563
You see, I could...
I could do this.

01:17:15.595 --> 01:17:18.230
I can do this, right?
I-I could be a great dad.

01:17:18.263 --> 01:17:20.764
You know what?
This was a really good talk.

01:17:20.796 --> 01:17:22.697
How about you just
give me a hug?

01:17:22.730 --> 01:17:24.231
Okay.

01:17:24.263 --> 01:17:25.899
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh, you're so cool.

01:17:25.931 --> 01:17:28.331
I knew it. I knew
we were gonna hit it off.

01:17:28.365 --> 01:17:31.566
Okay. All right.
All right. Oh, oh.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.834
Okay. All right. Okay.

01:17:33.867 --> 01:17:36.401
Let go. Uh-uh. Mm-mm.
Ah, wait, wait, wait.

01:17:36.433 --> 01:17:37.767
Get... Ah-ah-ah.

01:17:37.801 --> 01:17:39.635
A-All right, all right.
Oh, w-wait a minute.

01:17:39.668 --> 01:17:42.435
Hold on. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, no.

01:17:42.467 --> 01:17:44.635
What-what are you doing?

01:17:44.669 --> 01:17:45.936
Oh.

01:17:45.968 --> 01:17:47.369
Right. Um...

01:17:47.403 --> 01:17:48.703
No, don't.
You're on time-out.

01:17:48.735 --> 01:17:50.769
You need to stay here and...

01:17:50.803 --> 01:17:52.404
Matter of fact,
you go sit in the corner,

01:17:52.436 --> 01:17:53.603
you think about what you did.

01:17:53.636 --> 01:17:56.338
I-I'm gonna leave you
by yourself.

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.372
No, just... wait.

01:17:58.405 --> 01:18:00.806
Come back.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.908
Come on.

01:18:11.941 --> 01:18:13.508
- What's-what's her name?
- Oh, it... that's April.

01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:15.176
April. April!

01:18:15.209 --> 01:18:16.509
- Hey.
- Put me in your ear,

01:18:16.542 --> 01:18:17.643
and I'll tell you what to say.

01:18:17.675 --> 01:18:19.609
Time is money. Bring it.

01:18:19.642 --> 01:18:21.443
- What do you got?
- April?

01:18:21.476 --> 01:18:23.677
- I got to go.
- Don't you dare hang up on me!

01:18:23.710 --> 01:18:25.711
Sorry. It's...
Can't hang up.

01:18:25.744 --> 01:18:27.945
It was like, "Can you
hear me now?" And then it...

01:18:27.977 --> 01:18:30.211
April!

01:18:30.245 --> 01:18:33.811
Uh, the idea that we want
to pitch tomorrow

01:18:33.845 --> 01:18:35.747
is called, um...

01:18:37.812 --> 01:18:39.780
It's called DiscoverEyes.

01:18:39.814 --> 01:18:43.482
It's an interactive game
where you can see the world

01:18:43.514 --> 01:18:45.549
through the eyes of a child.

01:18:48.215 --> 01:18:49.749
Or, you know,
we have other ideas, too.

01:18:49.783 --> 01:18:51.815
- You... She...
- Mm-hmm. Right?

01:18:51.849 --> 01:18:54.551
No.
That's the one I want to hear.

01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:58.384
DiscoverEyes.

01:18:58.417 --> 01:18:59.617
Dope.

01:18:59.651 --> 01:19:02.486
I'll be back in 24 hours
to hear the pitch.

01:19:03.618 --> 01:19:04.818
- DiscoverEyes.
- Yes.

01:19:04.852 --> 01:19:05.886
DiscoverEyes.

01:19:05.919 --> 01:19:08.554
- Sounds promising.
- Yeah. - Right.

01:19:08.586 --> 01:19:10.654
DiscoverEyes.

01:19:10.687 --> 01:19:12.455
- Scott?
- Yeah.

01:19:14.653 --> 01:19:16.388
You did it.

01:19:16.421 --> 01:19:18.422
We did it, guys.

01:19:18.454 --> 01:19:19.822
You did what?!

01:19:19.854 --> 01:19:22.190
I never approved DiscoverEyes.

01:19:22.223 --> 01:19:24.723
I never approved
you even pitching that idea.

01:19:24.756 --> 01:19:26.723
And now my future
of my whole company

01:19:26.755 --> 01:19:28.591
is gonna be running off
an assistant's pitch?

01:19:28.624 --> 01:19:31.459
Well, what did you want me
to do? You told me to help.

01:19:32.558 --> 01:19:34.424
You serious?

01:19:36.657 --> 01:19:39.659
Disloyal, self-serving!

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:41.194
Huh.

01:19:41.226 --> 01:19:43.626
You did this for you, not me.

01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:45.328
Not the company.

01:19:45.361 --> 01:19:47.328
So I'm self-serving?

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.295
You're the one who only cares
about yourself.

01:19:50.329 --> 01:19:52.329
You're nasty to everyone here,

01:19:52.361 --> 01:19:54.629
like we're not trying to help
make your company great.

01:19:54.661 --> 01:19:55.862
Yeah, right.

01:19:55.896 --> 01:19:57.964
Sure. You stab me in the back,

01:19:57.997 --> 01:19:59.497
then blabbing
all your bad ideas

01:19:59.529 --> 01:20:02.597
to my top client
to get your first shot.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.298
How would you know?

01:20:04.332 --> 01:20:06.765
'Cause you've never even
heard my pitch.

01:20:06.799 --> 01:20:08.432
You are such a child.

01:20:08.464 --> 01:20:09.765
Whether you're 38 or 13,

01:20:09.799 --> 01:20:11.767
it's still the same mess
with you.

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:15.601
You see, now I know why you're
too scared of taking risks.

01:20:15.633 --> 01:20:18.868
'Cause you don't even know
what the hell you're doing!

01:20:18.901 --> 01:20:20.536
You should just stay scared.

01:20:22.268 --> 01:20:24.634
You know what?

01:20:24.668 --> 01:20:28.903
I'm sending all the pitches
in your in-box, including mine,

01:20:28.936 --> 01:20:30.637
because, clearly,
you want to do this

01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:32.237
on your own, which is fine.

01:20:32.269 --> 01:20:34.370
Yes, that's exactly
how I want it.

01:20:34.403 --> 01:20:35.838
You know what I want?

01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:37.572
Carbs!

01:20:37.605 --> 01:20:39.639
That's what I want!

01:20:39.671 --> 01:20:41.271
I quit!

01:20:41.304 --> 01:20:42.873
- Go, then!
- I'm doing that right now.

01:20:42.905 --> 01:20:44.839
I'm not following
your instructions anymore.

01:20:44.871 --> 01:20:46.440
So, girl, bye!

01:20:46.473 --> 01:20:47.707
Girl, bye!

01:20:47.739 --> 01:20:50.440
What'd you say?
Bye, girl!

01:20:50.474 --> 01:20:51.641
Girl, bye-bye!

01:20:51.674 --> 01:20:53.808
Bye, bye, bye! I'm NSYNC.

01:20:53.841 --> 01:20:56.274
And take
your damn bagels with you.

01:20:56.308 --> 01:20:58.410
Oh!
Was that an everything bagel?

01:20:58.442 --> 01:21:00.242
You are nothing!

01:21:00.275 --> 01:21:01.809
And bring me back my clothes.

01:21:01.843 --> 01:21:03.411
Too late. I stretched them out.

01:21:03.443 --> 01:21:05.276
- I still want them!
- Too bad.

01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:06.578
There's only one

01:21:06.610 --> 01:21:08.211
person I know
who acts like that.

01:21:08.245 --> 01:21:09.812
- Don't say it.
- Jordan Sanders.

01:21:11.478 --> 01:21:13.379
- Hey.
- What?

01:21:13.411 --> 01:21:16.512
- Who are you?
- Excuse me?

01:21:16.546 --> 01:21:18.581
- Whose child are you?
- Whose child are you?

01:21:18.613 --> 01:21:20.547
Whose child is this
walking around here

01:21:20.579 --> 01:21:21.913
in a tiny pink pantsuit?

01:21:21.946 --> 01:21:23.981
Shut up! Get back to work.

01:21:24.014 --> 01:21:25.515
You know what?

01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:26.748
She need a whupping.
What's in my purse?

01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:28.081
- What you doing?
- Let me go.

01:21:28.114 --> 01:21:30.348
You know, I'm gonna go get
a belt, 'cause I sure ain't...

01:21:30.381 --> 01:21:31.982
Yeah, get a belt.
Whup somebody else's child.

01:21:32.016 --> 01:21:35.483
You know, is it bad I hope
Jordan never comes back?

01:21:35.515 --> 01:21:36.950
No.

01:21:36.983 --> 01:21:38.584

that this may be

01:24:17.917 --> 01:24:19.618
your last chance to reverse
whatever this is,

01:24:19.651 --> 01:24:21.785
or you'll be living
that preteen life forever.

01:24:21.817 --> 01:24:23.851

- Yeah!

01:24:48.656 --> 01:24:49.990
Guys.

01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:53.325
You guys have to perform
tonight.

01:24:53.358 --> 01:24:55.859
B-But you said that was
s-social suicide.

01:24:55.892 --> 01:24:57.259
Look, I'm not gonna lie...

01:24:57.291 --> 01:24:58.891
you guys could go
to the hospital

01:24:58.924 --> 01:25:01.892
if you guys go on that stage,
but that shouldn't stop you.

01:25:01.926 --> 01:25:04.426
What? N-No.

01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:06.861
That should definitely
s-stop-stop us.

01:25:06.893 --> 01:25:09.295
You guys may be too young
to understand this,

01:25:09.327 --> 01:25:11.594
but I bailed
on being my true self

01:25:11.628 --> 01:25:14.463
because people told me
I didn't count or fit in.

01:25:14.496 --> 01:25:17.930
You're only like six months
older than us, Jordan.

01:25:17.963 --> 01:25:19.530
Everyone thinks
you have to grow up

01:25:19.563 --> 01:25:21.597
to figure out who you are,
but they're wrong.

01:25:21.630 --> 01:25:23.698
When we're kids,
we know who we are.

01:25:23.730 --> 01:25:26.665
It's just the world
that beats it out of us.

01:25:26.697 --> 01:25:27.831
So, with that being said,

01:25:27.865 --> 01:25:29.366
you guys should
perform the dance

01:25:29.399 --> 01:25:30.900
that you guys worked
so hard on.

01:25:32.665 --> 01:25:34.667
Come on, guys.
What do you say?

01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:36.900
No, uh, we're-we're-we're good.

01:25:36.933 --> 01:25:38.434
We're just chilling.

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:41.635
Yeah, we'll sit this one out.

01:25:41.667 --> 01:25:43.602
It's Jasmine's world.

01:25:43.635 --> 01:25:46.370
Who's got that
Winchella spirit?

01:25:48.969 --> 01:25:51.670
I'll teach you guys there's
nothing to be afraid of.

01:25:51.703 --> 01:25:52.903
What are you doing?

01:25:59.772 --> 01:26:01.705
Get off the stage!

01:26:01.737 --> 01:26:03.972
What's she doing over there?

01:26:04.006 --> 01:26:07.607
- Move it, Sanders!
- Get off the stage!

01:26:07.639 --> 01:26:09.373
Lame!

01:26:09.407 --> 01:26:11.706
No, guys,
let's give her a chance.

01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:13.508
See what she got.

01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:14.941
Give her some music.

01:26:14.975 --> 01:26:16.942
Yeah, let's see it.

01:26:19.409 --> 01:26:20.943
Do something!

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:23.376
Oh, my God.

01:26:37.645 --> 01:26:39.612
That's not cool.

01:26:39.645 --> 01:26:42.647
- Get off the stage!
- Boring!

01:26:58.317 --> 01:27:00.450
Yeah, get the running man.

01:27:00.484 --> 01:27:02.518
Okay.

01:27:06.085 --> 01:27:08.619
- Stanky leg!
- Yeah!

01:27:16.921 --> 01:27:18.355
Get it, Sanders!

01:27:32.490 --> 01:27:34.292
Oh!

01:27:37.091 --> 01:27:38.293
Oh, no, Jordan!

01:27:39.693 --> 01:27:41.660
Jordan, are you okay?

01:27:41.693 --> 01:27:43.661
Jordan!

01:27:47.027 --> 01:27:48.960
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry, guys.

01:27:48.994 --> 01:27:50.928
It's okay. You were great.

01:27:50.961 --> 01:27:53.395
That was the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for us.

01:27:53.429 --> 01:27:56.729

01:41:39.533 --> 01:41:42.134
With that in mind, please...

01:41:43.834 --> 01:41:47.101

01:41:47.134 --> 01:41:51.069

01:41:53.835 --> 01:41:57.703
- Step right up, associate April Williams.

01:41:57.737 --> 01:41:59.004
Thank you.

01:42:00.670 --> 01:42:03.005
I need a magnifying glass
to see it, but okay.

01:42:03.037 --> 01:42:04.704
Nah, if you, like...

01:42:04.737 --> 01:42:06.239
look right...
like, if you get this close...

01:42:06.271 --> 01:42:07.939
like, if you put
your forehead on it,

01:42:07.972 --> 01:42:10.506
you can see all of
"and Associates." That's...

01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:12.540
- That's nice.
- Yeah. That's us now, guys.

01:42:12.573 --> 01:42:14.475
- Ooh.

And I am so proud of you, April!

01:42:16.674 --> 01:42:17.808
Thank you.
Y-You know, I'm right here,

01:42:17.841 --> 01:42:19.141
so you don't have to use that.

01:42:19.175 --> 01:42:22.076
Okay,
if there's one thing I know,

01:42:22.108 --> 01:42:27.509
it's how JSI and Associates
like to celebrate.

01:42:27.543 --> 01:42:29.710

You get a doughnut!

01:42:39.979 --> 01:42:42.813

- You get a doughnut!

01:42:42.845 --> 01:42:45.012
You're incredible.

01:42:45.045 --> 01:42:47.013
Congrats.

01:42:47.047 --> 01:42:48.981
You can't do that.
I'm a boss now.

01:42:49.014 --> 01:42:50.482
What?

01:42:50.514 --> 01:42:51.815
Just kidding.
You can get it.

01:42:53.815 --> 01:42:55.883
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh, no.

01:42:55.915 --> 01:42:56.882
Guys!

01:42:56.915 --> 01:42:59.250
