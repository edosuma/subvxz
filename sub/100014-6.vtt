00:41.584 --> 00:43.836
Took his liver.

00:43.878 --> 00:46.797
Just like the first two.

00:46.839 --> 00:49.008
Where are we on them?

00:49.049 --> 00:52.178
Have you sorted out if they had
any kind of relationship?

00:54.805 --> 00:56.557
No, sir.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.811
They didn't know each other.

01:00.853 --> 01:04.397
Been on the case from the start,
he's got nothing.

01:07.526 --> 01:10.488
He was a good man, Morange.

01:10.529 --> 01:14.700
Never took so much as a stiver
for the work he did for us.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.619
Saw it as his civic duty.

01:16.660 --> 01:17.745
Oh, true enough, sir,

01:17.787 --> 01:20.706
but with respect,
there were rumors...

01:20.748 --> 01:24.251
- Rumors?
- Word was that he saw it

01:24.293 --> 01:27.463
as his "civic duty"
to do other jobs, too.

01:27.505 --> 01:30.216
- Jobs most doctors wouldn't touch.
- Such as?

01:30.257 --> 01:33.719
Abortions... reconstructions...

01:33.761 --> 01:35.071
What, convicts looking to have

01:35.095 --> 01:37.181
their brands removed,
that sort of thing?

01:37.223 --> 01:40.142
And Pix looking to pass.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.144
Getting their ears bobbed,
their wings sheared.

01:42.186 --> 01:43.646
Happens more often
than any of us

01:43.687 --> 01:46.816
would care to think, I'm afraid.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.321
Well?

01:52.363 --> 01:54.073
Philo?

01:56.075 --> 01:57.117
Sir.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.831
I said it's your case.

02:01.872 --> 02:05.835
If there's a connection between
the victims, then find it.

02:05.876 --> 02:08.503
Yes, sir.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.040
Morning, Father.

03:32.713 --> 03:33.881
"Hardtackers tack Harder

03:33.923 --> 03:35.633
with Longerbane Daughter
at the helm."

03:35.674 --> 03:40.262
Clever. Though I'm not sure
I know exactly what it means.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.222
It means she turned
the tables on me.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.600
That's what it means.

03:44.642 --> 03:47.728
I wish you hadn't been there
to see it.

03:47.770 --> 03:49.605
Ah, you make too much
of it, Father.

03:49.647 --> 03:52.191
Now you sound like your mother.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.485
Always trying to handle me.

03:54.526 --> 03:57.196
Like I'm a bottle
with a bad cork

03:57.237 --> 03:58.989
that might pop off at any moment

03:59.031 --> 04:01.200
and take someone's eye out.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.870
You've always taken after her,
even as a boy.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.917
The irony is, of course,
that... it's me

04:09.959 --> 04:11.251
she'd rather you took after.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.339
To that end, I thought I might
come watch you

04:15.381 --> 04:16.464
in Parliament again today.

04:16.507 --> 04:20.219
- There's no session today.
- Oh.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.514
Longerbane's body
is lying in state.

04:23.555 --> 04:27.643
His daughter will be receiving
condolences from his supporters.

04:27.685 --> 04:30.980
- Really?
- I know.

04:31.021 --> 04:35.192
I needn't have allowed it,
considering what he did to you.

04:35.275 --> 04:39.029
But remember one
of the first rules of politics:

04:39.071 --> 04:42.491
magnanimity in victory
goes a long way

04:42.533 --> 04:45.119
towards disarming one's enemies.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.997
Very wise, Father.

04:52.418 --> 04:54.044
Seeing as I have
little to do today,

04:54.086 --> 04:56.171
I thought I might go
to the country.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.590
Perhaps we could
go riding together?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.300
You well know I would greatly
enjoy that,

05:00.342 --> 05:02.302
but I really should attend
to my studies.

05:02.344 --> 05:06.515
Master Symes has been amassing
an army of tutors on my behalf.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.749
I'm so sorry.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.667
Thank you.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.127
I promise to do my best

05:35.169 --> 05:37.171
to carry forth
my father's legacy.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.092
I pray so.

05:42.134 --> 05:44.178
He was the only man brave enough

05:44.219 --> 05:45.655
to tell the truth
about what these...

05:45.679 --> 05:48.057
Critch are doing to our city.

05:50.726 --> 05:54.980
Never give up the faith.
He stood for all of us.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.085
Morning.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.336
Hello.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.883
Who's that?

06:24.551 --> 06:27.054
A gent from last night.

06:27.096 --> 06:28.889
I do them all, actually.

06:28.931 --> 06:32.976
Soon as the light's up.
Is that strange?

06:33.018 --> 06:36.355
Not for you.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.274
He almost looks... grateful.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.860
Mm. Some of them are.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.238
Because you made them feel
young again for the night.

06:44.279 --> 06:47.574
That they don't have to hate
their own bodies.

06:47.616 --> 06:48.867
Some of them are just pigs,

06:48.909 --> 06:51.370
but I sketch them, too,
all the same.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.873
For some reason when you get
their faces down on paper,

06:54.915 --> 06:56.750
they're easier to forget.

06:59.336 --> 07:03.173
There's more in there
than I care to count.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.469
Maybe one day
when I've given up the life,

07:07.511 --> 07:09.763
I'll have a show.

07:09.805 --> 07:12.391
"A Whore's Revenge,"
I'll call it.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.274
I missed you.

07:20.315 --> 07:21.608
Me, too.

07:32.578 --> 07:33.745
There's been another killing.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.833
Maybe there is a connection
between the victims.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.085
Maybe there's not.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.462
Could be they were just
unlucky enough to cross paths

07:42.504 --> 07:44.173
with whoever this maniac is.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.258
Sir, I tracked down a cabbie

07:46.300 --> 07:47.968
who drove Morange home
last night.

07:48.010 --> 07:49.928
Says he picked him up
on the Row.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.264
What was he doing on the Row?

07:52.306 --> 07:53.891
Driver couldn't say.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.435
Only that he picked him up
outside a Pix brothel.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.687
Morange?

07:58.729 --> 08:00.939
G-Go check it out.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.275
Fucking case just gets uglier
by the day.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.028
We'll crack it, sir.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.780
Just because Philo
couldn't find a connection

08:08.822 --> 08:13.035
between the victims
doesn't mean there isn't one.

08:57.287 --> 09:00.123
Show us your face!
We seek you in darkness.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.959
Show us your face!

09:02.000 --> 09:04.086
Oh, Hidden One!

09:04.127 --> 09:07.464
Show us your face!
Our flesh deceives us!

09:07.506 --> 09:09.508
Show us your face.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.719
We seek you in darkness.
Show us your face.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.764
Show us your face.

09:24.773 --> 09:28.568
This has just come for you
from the dressmakers.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.821
I thought as much.

09:30.862 --> 09:33.532
I've agreed to
accompany Mr. Agreus

09:33.573 --> 09:37.703
to the charity auction
at the museum this afternoon.

09:37.744 --> 09:41.665
It seems he aims to salve
my humiliation with a gift.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.751
Lay it out then, let's see it.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.800
Huh.

09:58.140 --> 10:01.226
He certainly spared no expense.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.895
The color suits you well, too.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.485
What is it?

10:10.527 --> 10:13.113
Please, sit down.

10:13.155 --> 10:16.074
Ezra...

10:16.116 --> 10:18.201
you're scaring me.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.454
Do you remember Dr. Morange?

10:20.495 --> 10:23.081
Father's friend?

10:23.123 --> 10:25.125
He's been killed.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.129
What happened?

10:29.171 --> 10:30.422
The same that happened

10:30.464 --> 10:33.342
to the headmaster the other day.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.220
Another murder?

10:37.262 --> 10:40.140
What is this city coming to?

10:40.182 --> 10:42.851
I wonder what Mr. Philostrate
can tell us about it.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.436
Has he come down?

10:44.478 --> 10:45.812
He's not here.

10:45.854 --> 10:49.191
He left just after midnight.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.568
One can hear all the comings
and goings in this house,

10:51.610 --> 10:53.320
the walls are paper-thin.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.617
They're saying it was
someone from the constabulary

10:58.658 --> 11:01.745
was killed.
I trust he's all right.

11:01.787 --> 11:04.581
Good day. To you both.

11:04.623 --> 11:06.083
Good day, Mr. Grayson.

11:08.210 --> 11:10.420
A word if you please, Mrs. Fyfe?

11:10.462 --> 11:12.923
Of course, Mr. Bagstock.

11:12.964 --> 11:15.884
Please be advised that
unless this situation

11:15.926 --> 11:17.719
comes to an immediate stop,

11:17.761 --> 11:21.306
I will be vacating my room
at month's end.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.724
I'm sorry, what situation?

11:22.766 --> 11:25.477
Oh, don't play me
for a fool, Mrs. Fyfe.

11:25.519 --> 11:26.871
I'd long suspected
something was afoot,

11:26.895 --> 11:28.772
and last night I saw you
leaving his room

11:28.814 --> 11:30.399
with my own eyes.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.025
An old widow parading about

11:32.067 --> 11:33.693
like some kind of harlot.

11:33.735 --> 11:37.906
I may be an old widow,
but I am a grown woman

11:37.948 --> 11:39.449
in charge of my own life.

11:39.491 --> 11:42.911
Very well, then.

11:42.953 --> 11:46.456
I'll expect my deposit returned
expeditiously upon my departure.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.546
Mr. Bagstock?

12:02.431 --> 12:04.558
Be out by the end of the day.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.609
If I might have a moment alone
with my father...

12:14.651 --> 12:15.819
Of course.

12:15.861 --> 12:18.113
Everyone, please leave.

12:18.155 --> 12:20.198
Miss Longerbane needs
a moment alone.

12:22.451 --> 12:23.910
Not you, Jenila.

12:23.952 --> 12:27.706
Unpin this.
Terrible headache.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.875
Yes, miss.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.588
God's noose.
I thought it would never end!

12:34.629 --> 12:35.922
So many of them.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.425
"I'm so sorry for your loss."

12:38.467 --> 12:41.803
Thank you so much...

12:41.845 --> 12:43.472
...for your kind words.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.807
Hold still while I unpin it.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.018
Oh, was I at all convincing?

12:48.059 --> 12:51.188
Asking for a moment alone
was a nice touch.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.647
Mm.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.191
Did you think so, Father?

12:55.650 --> 12:57.194
Don't look like that.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.738
Huh.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.493
Who's there?

13:06.578 --> 13:09.664
Answer, or I'll call the guards.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.673
You're Jonah Breakspear.

13:18.715 --> 13:22.135
I'm sorry for the intrusion,
Miss Longerbane.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.429
What are you doing here?

13:24.471 --> 13:26.973
I came only to pay my respects.

13:27.015 --> 13:30.894
To the man who kidnapped you?

13:30.936 --> 13:32.312
Liar.

13:32.354 --> 13:33.789
Said the girl who just
cleared the room

13:33.813 --> 13:35.982
so she could pretend
to grieve her father.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.778
Come closer.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.414
Is this close enough?

13:51.456 --> 13:54.459
Suppose it was inevitable
that our paths would cross

13:54.501 --> 13:57.754
sooner or later.

13:57.796 --> 14:01.591
I have to admit, you're not
at all what I expected.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.802
What did you expect?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.346
Well, certainly not someone
with such evident affection

14:06.388 --> 14:09.266
for their Critch handmaid,
for one thing.

14:09.307 --> 14:12.936
Given your performance
in Parliament yesterday.

14:12.978 --> 14:15.981
Of course it was a performance.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.608
I don't like the word "Critch."

14:18.650 --> 14:20.026
Is that so?

14:20.068 --> 14:23.321
It's a good slur,
as far as slurs go.

14:23.363 --> 14:27.158
But even so,
as my father's daughter,

14:27.200 --> 14:28.886
that performance would've been
one I would've

14:28.910 --> 14:30.245
been a fool not to give.

14:30.287 --> 14:34.124
And you are, self-evidently,
no fool.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.585
Despite the rumors.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.920
Rumors?

14:38.962 --> 14:41.298
That the reason your father's
kept you sequestered away

14:41.339 --> 14:44.259
all these years is because
you had a difficult birth,

14:44.301 --> 14:47.095
and came into this world
a simpleton.

14:47.137 --> 14:51.016
The birth was difficult.
It cost my mother her life.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.851
And it made my father,
quite naturally,

14:52.892 --> 14:55.270
overprotective of his
only daughter.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.940
Well, whatever the reason,

14:58.982 --> 15:02.235
it sounds like you had
a lonely childhood.

15:02.277 --> 15:05.155
I suppose it was.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.907
A little girl, no friends

15:07.949 --> 15:10.744
but for the volumes
in her library.

15:10.785 --> 15:15.165
No amusements but for
the litany of secrets

15:15.206 --> 15:18.960
drifting up from the smoky room
down the hall,

15:19.002 --> 15:23.214
where the most important men
in the city whisper and plot.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.844
It's no wonder you learned
to lie so convincingly.

15:27.886 --> 15:30.847
And how to discern lies.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.141
Such as?

15:33.183 --> 15:36.269
I know my father didn't
kidnap you.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.441
Who else, if not my father's
fiercest foe?

15:41.483 --> 15:45.737
Who can say for certain?
Perhaps his dearest love.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.784
I haven't the foggiest idea
what you mean by that.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.994
Oh, I think you do.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.997
I think you knew before
you even asked the question.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.835
Why, Master Jonah,

16:00.877 --> 16:05.131
is that fear
in your pretty eyes?

16:05.173 --> 16:09.260
Are you scared of poor little
Sophie Longerbane?

16:09.302 --> 16:12.263
Should I be?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.265
Perhaps.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.520
Perhaps not.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.121
We could be friends
if we had a mind to.

16:20.146 --> 16:23.483
I suspect we have much
in common.

16:23.525 --> 16:25.944
Oh?

16:25.985 --> 16:29.072
The two sole heirs
of the city's two

16:29.114 --> 16:32.033
most important families.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.869
Overprotected.

16:34.911 --> 16:37.580
Chronically underestimated.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.960
There's only one difference
I can see.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.171
What's that?

16:47.090 --> 16:49.259
I am free of my parents.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.180
Good day, Master Jonah.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.200
Mr. Philostrate.

17:17.746 --> 17:20.832
Home for a bath
and a change of clothes, I see.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.638
Let's make a real go of this.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.433
The two of us.

17:38.475 --> 17:42.228
You can give this room up,
keep it if you like.

17:42.270 --> 17:46.065
But stay upstairs with me.

17:46.107 --> 17:49.903
I'd like that.
Don't think I wouldn't.

17:52.322 --> 17:54.449
But I don't think I can give you
the things you want.

17:54.491 --> 17:59.162
You already have.
More than you realize.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.874
You're still young.

18:02.916 --> 18:07.086
You can have a family,
but not with me.

18:07.128 --> 18:10.381
Who said anything about that?

18:10.423 --> 18:12.091
We can work all that out later,

18:12.133 --> 18:15.637
- but right now...
- I need you to listen to me.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.764
Please.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.162
The other day when you said
I was hiding something,

18:23.186 --> 18:25.980
you were right.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.233
Tell me.

18:28.274 --> 18:31.611
Whatever it is,
it won't matter.

18:31.653 --> 18:35.406
These murders,
they're all connected.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.744
To me.

18:39.786 --> 18:44.290
You said one was
your old headmaster,

18:44.332 --> 18:45.333
but the others?

18:45.375 --> 18:48.086
The doctor who was killed
last night,

18:48.127 --> 18:50.713
I think it's because...

18:52.590 --> 18:54.384
...he's the one who
did it to me.

18:54.425 --> 18:56.344
Did what?

18:56.386 --> 19:00.139
She brought me to him
when I was a baby.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.683
The fae.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.726
The singer?

19:06.062 --> 19:07.522
Yeah.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.154
She was...

19:18.157 --> 19:20.451
She was my mother.

19:24.414 --> 19:27.166
I don't understand.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.961
What you're saying doesn't
make any sense.

19:30.003 --> 19:33.673
I'm half-fae, Portia.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.681
From when my wings were shorn.

19:48.897 --> 19:51.691
If this is a joke,
it's not funny.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.484
It's the truth.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.154
Now you know.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.035
Get out.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.538
Get out.

20:05.580 --> 20:08.166
Take your things
and get out now.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.072
731.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.615
Again?

20:40.657 --> 20:42.075
It's my lucky number.

24:03.234 --> 24:04.986
I'll see you there. I love you.

24:05.027 --> 24:06.404
I love you.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.573
I'm going to seal the library.

24:25.756 --> 24:29.468
- Sergeant.
- Sykes.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.098
What are you doing here?

24:45.067 --> 24:48.487
I just needed a place to think.

24:53.159 --> 24:56.579
Finally caught up with you,
did it?

25:00.333 --> 25:02.376
Philo.

25:05.963 --> 25:08.507
Oh, you think I don't know?

25:08.549 --> 25:11.385
How'd you find out?

25:11.427 --> 25:15.514
I can smell the fae
in you, even now.

25:15.556 --> 25:20.102
Like I told you,
the wolf fades slowly.

25:20.144 --> 25:22.688
You never said anything.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.899
What the fuck is there to say?

25:24.941 --> 25:26.901
It is what it is.

25:26.943 --> 25:29.946
All you can do is keep
your mouth shut and move on.

25:30.988 --> 25:34.033
I told Portia.

25:42.083 --> 25:45.002
Why?

25:45.044 --> 25:46.837
Oh, I don't know...

25:46.879 --> 25:48.273
- I thought... I don't know!
- What?

25:48.297 --> 25:52.468
I just, I thought maybe she'd...

25:52.510 --> 25:55.346
What? She'd accept you
for what you are?

25:55.388 --> 25:58.182
Make things better?

25:58.224 --> 26:01.310
What the fuck
were you thinking, Philo?

26:01.352 --> 26:03.145
If this gets out,
this could destroy you.

26:03.187 --> 26:04.522
She won't tell anyone.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.233
Well, she better not.

26:07.275 --> 26:10.444
You're the only reason
they let me live.

26:10.486 --> 26:14.282
If anything happens to you,

26:14.323 --> 26:17.910
what the fuck's
gonna happen to me?

26:19.662 --> 26:21.539
Oh, Hidden One.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.542
- Show us your face!
- Our flesh deceives us.

26:24.583 --> 26:28.004
- Show us your face!
- We seek you in darkness.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.672
Show us your face!

26:29.714 --> 26:32.800
- Oh, Hidden One.
- Show us your face!

26:32.842 --> 26:36.345
- Our flesh deceives us.
- Show us your face!

26:36.387 --> 26:39.098
- We seek you in darkness.
- Stupid Critch.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.392
Putting a beating
on their own selves?

26:41.434 --> 26:43.227
All for some fake god?

26:43.269 --> 26:46.772
Hey, don't you shites know
that's our job?

26:47.982 --> 26:50.401
See? I can do it ten times
better than you, aye?

26:50.443 --> 26:53.070
Oh, that's right.

26:53.112 --> 26:56.991
But punches aren't what you're
interested in, is it, aye?

26:57.033 --> 26:59.076
- You favor this, don't you?
- No.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.746
All right, then.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.958
All is as the Hidden One
wills it.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.420
You'll let me know if I'm doing
it right, won't you, huh?

27:09.462 --> 27:11.213
Like this?

27:11.255 --> 27:14.675
Watch and learn.
This is the truth.

27:14.717 --> 27:17.636
They will never accept us.

27:18.888 --> 27:21.849
They will never understand us.

27:21.891 --> 27:25.519
We can make no peace
with the ignorant.

27:49.293 --> 27:53.464
Oh, do something, Moira,
before he hurts himself.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.762
Can I help you, lad?

27:59.804 --> 28:01.889
I've come from the constabulary.

28:01.931 --> 28:05.184
- Ooh, I can see that.
- About the matter of a certain gentleman

28:05.226 --> 28:06.453
we have reason
to believe visited

28:06.477 --> 28:08.062
these premises last night.

28:08.104 --> 28:09.563
Since deceased.

28:09.605 --> 28:13.025
You mean poor Morange,
of course.

28:13.067 --> 28:15.152
I told the inspector
who was here last night

28:15.194 --> 28:16.779
everything I know.

28:16.821 --> 28:19.698
What inspector?

28:19.740 --> 28:21.992
Philo was there last night?

28:22.034 --> 28:24.328
Odd he didn't say anything.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.539
Probably just slipped his mind.

28:26.580 --> 28:29.083
Yeah, he hasn't been himself.

28:29.125 --> 28:30.925
I think he took what happened
at the boys home

28:30.960 --> 28:32.753
harder than he let on.

28:32.795 --> 28:34.505
That was his headmaster,
after all.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.382
Closest thing he ever had
to a father.

28:36.424 --> 28:39.176
What I want to know
is why was he following

28:39.218 --> 28:41.762
after Morange
in the first place?

28:41.804 --> 28:43.597
The night he was killed,
no less.

28:43.639 --> 28:46.725
It is curious,
I'll grant you that, Sergeant.

28:46.767 --> 28:49.019
Now, you've been with him
since the start of this case,

28:49.061 --> 28:50.855
- haven't you, Berwick?
- Yes, sir.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.816
Is there anything else
I should be made aware of?

28:55.192 --> 28:58.529
Well, out with it, man.

28:58.571 --> 29:03.576
It's to do with Critch rumors,
a beast they call a Darkasher.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.704
A thing you raise from the dead

29:06.745 --> 29:10.666
to do your bidding,
even kill for you.

29:10.708 --> 29:13.669
Philo swears he's seen it.

29:14.879 --> 29:17.339
Right.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.968
There he is.

29:25.222 --> 29:27.933
Keep an eye on him, understood?

29:27.975 --> 29:30.686
Any irregularities.

29:34.440 --> 29:39.403
Oy, if you could
get this upstairs...

29:39.445 --> 29:41.071
Something happen, Inspector?

29:41.113 --> 29:46.660
I've decided to find new
accommodations, closer to work.

29:46.702 --> 29:51.040
Remember that old fella, the one
we met in the fae's flat?

29:51.081 --> 29:53.042
Yeah, of course.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.936
Think I heard something about
a show he's putting on.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.795
On the road.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.631
Want me to come
with you, Inspector?

29:58.672 --> 30:00.674
No need.

30:11.644 --> 30:15.606
Just a quick look,
before the crowds.

30:15.648 --> 30:17.775
It was founded
in the summer of '41

30:17.816 --> 30:20.402
when our brave lads
took Anoun back from the Pact

30:20.444 --> 30:22.446
and held it until that Austery.

30:22.488 --> 30:26.367
It was brought across
the sea timber by timber.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.118
Mind you,

30:28.160 --> 30:30.788
- there are some naughty bits.
- What?

30:30.829 --> 30:34.291
Oh.

30:37.086 --> 30:38.754
Look at that one.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.884
You're not supposed
to be in here.

30:43.926 --> 30:48.889
Get the fuck out!

31:24.258 --> 31:28.053
Shut that bloody dog up!

31:33.726 --> 31:36.812
I know who you are.

31:52.286 --> 31:54.955
What is it?

31:54.997 --> 31:56.999
What did you see?

31:59.501 --> 32:02.546
- My death.
- No.

32:03.797 --> 32:05.382
Are you certain?

32:05.424 --> 32:07.384
I have felt it.

32:07.426 --> 32:11.096
Coming closer and closer.

32:11.138 --> 32:14.183
But surely if, if you saw
what's to come,

32:14.224 --> 32:16.185
there must be some way
to prevent it.

32:16.226 --> 32:18.604
My dear girl, did you learn
nothing all those years

32:18.646 --> 32:22.107
sitting at me knee,
watching and listening?

32:22.149 --> 32:25.778
There is no cheating death.

32:25.819 --> 32:30.074
Especially when it's to come
at the hand of a Darkasher.

32:31.325 --> 32:33.952
A Darkasher?

32:36.872 --> 32:38.832
Tell me.

32:38.874 --> 32:41.377
I didn't come here
to talk about my fate.

32:41.418 --> 32:44.296
- You wanted to know about Jonah's.
- No.

32:44.338 --> 32:46.924
Your safety is what matters.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.718
You will stay here until the
danger has passed.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.762
Don't even try to say no.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.900
Hey!

33:19.957 --> 33:21.709
Sit down.

34:13.010 --> 34:14.386
I know this isn't

34:14.428 --> 34:16.388
easy for you.

34:16.429 --> 34:20.309
- Perhaps some champagne.
- Yes, please.

34:25.688 --> 34:28.400
Imogen.

34:28.442 --> 34:30.444
Louisa. Leslie.

34:32.612 --> 34:34.656
Mr. Agreus.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.949
Two days in a row now.

34:36.992 --> 34:39.203
This must be serious.

34:39.244 --> 34:42.498
Mr. Agreus,
this is Leslie Boythorn.

34:44.833 --> 34:48.003
Must say I'm surprised
to see you here, Imogen.

34:48.045 --> 34:52.174
Or did Ezra suddenly find
his lost fortune?

34:53.425 --> 34:55.219
As I understand it,

34:55.260 --> 34:57.721
he's putting his money to work
in the shipping trade.

34:57.763 --> 35:01.141
Do I have that right,
Miss Spurnrose?

35:01.183 --> 35:03.143
It's quite right.

35:03.185 --> 35:04.978
Admirable to see
a man apply himself

35:05.020 --> 35:08.065
when he could so easily rest
on his inherited good fortune.

35:09.733 --> 35:11.568
Leslie has his eye
on the most striking

35:11.610 --> 35:14.404
and triumphant painting
from Augustus Hope.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.823
The Rising?

35:15.864 --> 35:18.158
More than just an eye,
Louisa, dear.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.993
I intend to purchase it.

35:20.035 --> 35:23.705
It's expected to fetch well
north of 100,000 guilder.

35:23.747 --> 35:26.583
What was it about it
that caught your eye?

35:26.625 --> 35:28.210
I'm curious.

35:28.252 --> 35:30.712
It's a masterwork.

35:30.754 --> 35:32.381
Everyone knows that.

35:32.422 --> 35:35.384
And at that price,
if it doesn't match the drapes

35:35.425 --> 35:37.803
in your drawing room,
I suppose you'll just have

35:37.845 --> 35:39.221
to get new drapes.

35:39.263 --> 35:41.598
Louisa?

35:41.640 --> 35:43.976
Shall we?

35:44.017 --> 35:46.395
Hmm. Yes.

35:46.436 --> 35:50.899
She had sex with him in
the carriage on the way here.

35:50.941 --> 35:52.901
How do you know that?

35:52.943 --> 35:55.362
We Puck have keen senses.

35:55.404 --> 35:57.781
I'm surprised
they made it inside.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.325
That girl is so tightly wound,

36:00.367 --> 36:02.369
it's a miracle
the fool didn't get stuck.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.418
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:09.459 --> 36:12.170
if you'll kindly
take your seats.

36:12.212 --> 36:15.841
Oy!

36:22.055 --> 36:24.016
Come back here!

36:48.832 --> 36:50.876
Did you not see
what was happening?

36:50.918 --> 36:53.670
No, it doesn't matter anymore.
They're gone.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.214
- Who's gone?
- All of them.

36:56.256 --> 36:58.842
Leopold, Cassiopeia,

36:58.884 --> 37:01.970
Fike, Traidy.

37:02.012 --> 37:04.097
They've all been deported
by your lot.

37:07.059 --> 37:09.853
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.522
Maybe it was for the best.
At least, I'd like to think so

37:12.564 --> 37:14.584
because it's not much being
an immigrant in the Burgue

37:14.608 --> 37:18.278
these days, but...

37:18.320 --> 37:19.696
I shall miss them,

37:19.738 --> 37:23.367
however infuriating
they could be.

37:23.408 --> 37:24.826
T-Tell me, Inspector,

37:24.868 --> 37:28.622
did you keep your promise?

37:28.664 --> 37:31.375
Have you found justice
for my Aisling?

37:31.416 --> 37:34.294
That's why I was looking
for you, as it happens.

37:34.336 --> 37:36.296
I'd like to know more.

37:36.338 --> 37:39.758
Listen, I only just
arrived in the Burgue

37:39.800 --> 37:41.969
and I know nothing
about her recent life.

37:42.010 --> 37:45.806
It's her past that interests me.

37:45.847 --> 37:47.224
I have reason to believe

37:47.265 --> 37:50.602
that she did in fact
have a child,

37:50.644 --> 37:52.771
and that the circumstances
of that child's birth

37:52.813 --> 37:57.359
may have had something to do
with what got her killed.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.363
Her past.

38:04.741 --> 38:07.244
Well...

38:07.285 --> 38:10.747
Listen, ought six,

38:10.789 --> 38:12.958
or ought seven,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.752
when she was at the height
of her fame,

38:15.794 --> 38:20.007
there was someone,
someone she wouldn't talk about,

38:20.048 --> 38:22.092
but I had never
seen her so happy.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.845
And then, one day,
something changed.

38:24.886 --> 38:27.806
She canceled her standing
engagement at the Abbey.

38:27.848 --> 38:31.435
She went away for some time,
months in fact,

38:31.476 --> 38:34.271
and when she came back,
she was changed,

38:34.312 --> 38:37.941
sadder somehow.

38:37.983 --> 38:41.069
And I always wondered if...

38:41.111 --> 38:44.823
She'd gone away to have a baby.

38:44.865 --> 38:48.869
That was my instinct.
She never said, I never asked.

38:51.455 --> 38:53.498
She wrote a song about it.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.500
At least I like to think
it was about

38:55.542 --> 38:56.793
a child that she'd given away.

39:12.768 --> 39:14.770
You know it.

39:17.564 --> 39:20.609
If there was a child,

39:20.650 --> 39:23.737
where would she go to have
the baby, do you know?

39:23.779 --> 39:28.492
She stayed with a benefactor
in the Crossing.

39:28.533 --> 39:29.993
A benefactor?

39:30.035 --> 39:32.746
Well, things were different
in those days, Inspector.

39:32.788 --> 39:36.291
Friendships between their kind
and ours were not so...

39:36.333 --> 39:38.335
impossible.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.925
You wouldn't happen to know
the surname of this benefactor?

39:44.966 --> 39:47.552
How could I forget?

39:47.594 --> 39:51.890
He was the finest watchmaker
in the Burgue,

39:51.932 --> 39:54.893
at the time.

39:54.935 --> 39:58.563
Good day to you, Inspector.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.374
Next, an unparalleled work

40:17.415 --> 40:19.751
by Augustus Hope.

40:19.793 --> 40:22.546
The Rising was donated by

40:22.587 --> 40:24.089
Sir Elgenai
and Lady Tripplethorne.

40:29.261 --> 40:31.096
The floor is open.
Bidding starts

40:31.138 --> 40:33.431
at 100,000 guilder.

40:34.975 --> 40:38.270
100,000. Do I have 120?

40:40.313 --> 40:41.940
140?

40:43.316 --> 40:45.152
175?

40:47.571 --> 40:51.283
200,000?

40:52.742 --> 40:54.244
200,000

40:54.286 --> 40:56.329
from Mr. Leslie Boythorn.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.623
A record, friends.

40:58.665 --> 41:02.586
Do I have 225?

41:02.627 --> 41:05.172
220, anyone?

41:05.213 --> 41:07.883
For a priceless masterpiece.

41:07.924 --> 41:10.385
210?

41:13.471 --> 41:15.432
Well, then,

41:15.473 --> 41:16.683
200,000 guilder.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.395
Going once, going twice...

41:20.437 --> 41:23.023
300,000 guilder.

41:27.194 --> 41:29.279
I'm-I'm sorry, but...

41:29.321 --> 41:31.281
do you even have
that sort of money?

41:31.323 --> 41:34.075
On hand, you mean?

41:40.457 --> 41:43.043
300,000 guilder.

41:43.084 --> 41:44.252
Going once.

41:44.294 --> 41:46.046
Twice...

41:48.006 --> 41:50.759
Sold!

41:55.889 --> 41:57.474
Champagne?

42:00.560 --> 42:02.354
Everyone's staring.

42:02.395 --> 42:04.606
Well, we could go if you'd like.

42:04.648 --> 42:07.108
No, no.

42:11.404 --> 42:15.700
I'm curious, did you intend
to purchase that painting today?

42:19.913 --> 42:21.706
Why did you then?

42:21.748 --> 42:23.500
Do you find it beautiful?

42:23.541 --> 42:25.835
Of course.

42:25.877 --> 42:28.630
Perhaps not 300,000
guilder beautiful...

42:31.758 --> 42:34.719
I did it because
I wanted to see his face.

42:34.761 --> 42:38.807
I wanted him to know
that I could take it from him.

42:38.848 --> 42:40.100
Why?

42:40.141 --> 42:44.354
Because he took it for granted
that it should be his.

42:44.396 --> 42:46.815
And what will you do with it?

42:46.856 --> 42:49.317
Hang it in my home,

42:49.359 --> 42:51.736
and then buy drapes to match it.

42:55.532 --> 42:59.494
You are not at all
what I expected, Mr. Agreus.

43:01.162 --> 43:03.290
Nor are you, Miss Spurnrose,

43:03.331 --> 43:05.333
nor are you.

43:41.536 --> 43:43.538
If it's Inspector Philostrate
you're looking for,

43:43.580 --> 43:46.291
he's no longer a tenant here.

43:46.333 --> 43:50.086
I heard he was looking
for a new place to let.

43:50.128 --> 43:52.213
That's why I'm here.

43:52.255 --> 43:55.050
You're interested
in his room then?

43:55.091 --> 43:59.512
I'm interested
why he up and left.

44:02.349 --> 44:03.725
She didn't want to say nothing

44:03.767 --> 44:06.144
at first, but I got it
out of her.

44:06.186 --> 44:09.564
Poor woman, you have to feel
sorry for her.

44:09.606 --> 44:10.940
Being taken in like that.

44:10.982 --> 44:14.652
Still can't believe it,
a half-blood.

44:14.694 --> 44:17.739
Passing right under our noses.

44:17.781 --> 44:19.949
It's a fucking disgrace.

44:19.991 --> 44:21.743
There's more.

44:21.785 --> 44:25.580
Go on.

44:25.622 --> 44:26.790
She told me

44:26.831 --> 44:30.919
he said the murdered fae,
the singer,

44:30.960 --> 44:32.545
was his mum.

44:32.587 --> 44:34.589
Fuck me.

44:34.631 --> 44:38.885
It all adds up.
His mum, the headmaster,

44:38.927 --> 44:41.096
they both would've known
the truth.

44:41.137 --> 44:43.932
What about Morange?

44:43.973 --> 44:47.644
Maybe the headmaster whispered
something to him in the dark.

44:47.685 --> 44:51.398
Or maybe he's the one that
clipped him back in the day.

44:51.439 --> 44:53.900
All that Darkasher nonsense
he made up

44:53.942 --> 44:57.487
to try and cover his tracks.

44:57.529 --> 44:58.905
By the Martyr,

44:58.947 --> 45:03.493
it's been Philo all along.

45:03.535 --> 45:05.578
He killed 'em
to hide his secret.

45:05.620 --> 45:08.706
- You got a man on him now?
- Yeah.

45:08.748 --> 45:10.208
Then bring him in.

45:39.404 --> 45:41.739
Can I help you, Inspector?

45:43.783 --> 45:47.328
I remember her.
I'd just started here.

45:47.370 --> 45:50.540
Mr. Spurnrose, may he bask
in the Martyr's light,

45:50.582 --> 45:53.293
let her have what's now
Miss Imogen's room.

45:53.334 --> 45:55.753
He was a good man.

45:55.795 --> 45:58.506
Progressive for his time.

45:58.548 --> 45:59.924
He even arranged for a doctor

45:59.966 --> 46:02.760
- to look after her.
- Morange.

46:02.802 --> 46:05.472
I expect you know
what happened to him.

46:05.513 --> 46:07.807
Well, there's not
much more to tell.

46:07.849 --> 46:10.477
She stayed until the baby came.

46:10.518 --> 46:14.189
Cried for days
after Morange left with him.

46:14.230 --> 46:17.317
The father, did he ever visit?

46:17.358 --> 46:19.527
She never spoke of him.

46:19.569 --> 46:23.031
I had the feeling
she was frightened of him.

46:25.074 --> 46:28.328
- You've no idea who he was?
- None.

46:28.369 --> 46:30.330
Poor wee thing

46:30.371 --> 46:32.916
had these sad little wings.

46:32.957 --> 46:34.167
By the looks of them,

46:34.209 --> 46:38.713
I doubt he would've been able
to take to the air,

46:38.755 --> 46:41.674
if he survived that is.

46:41.716 --> 46:45.512
A lot of the time, half-bloods
don't, not for long anyway.

46:47.555 --> 46:50.016
I always wondered
what became of him.

46:56.731 --> 46:58.566
I'm coming.

46:58.608 --> 47:01.027
I'm coming!

47:03.821 --> 47:05.823
- Good evening...
- Where is he?

47:11.538 --> 47:14.374
Rycroft Philostrate,

47:14.415 --> 47:16.376
you're under arrest.

47:18.378 --> 47:19.879
On what charge?

47:19.921 --> 47:23.508
Suspicion of murder.
Three counts.

47:28.596 --> 47:30.348
Murder?

47:33.142 --> 47:34.686
Cuff him.

47:47.365 --> 47:49.826
You don't have to
wonder anymore.

47:49.867 --> 47:51.786
Shut up,

47:51.828 --> 47:55.206
you fucking Critch!
