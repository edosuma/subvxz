[Earth rumbling]

00:27.900 --> 00:31.900
[suspenseful music]

00:33.367 --> 00:34.833
[Harry] You want me to
tell that story?

00:34.900 --> 00:36.667
They're gonna make a
record of it on video.

00:36.733 --> 00:37.633
[Edna] No, it's fine, it's fine.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.900
Everybody wants to know
how old couples met

00:40.000 --> 00:41.400
and stayed together, go ahead.

00:41.800 --> 00:42.733
Okay.

00:43.500 --> 00:44.300
She peed on me.

00:44.367 --> 00:47.167
Oh, do you have to start
the story like that?

00:47.233 --> 00:49.700
I thought she peed on me.

00:49.767 --> 00:53.000
When he says she, he
means Maggie,

00:53.067 --> 00:54.400
Maggie, the dog.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.500
Yeah, and it bothered
you so much,

00:58.567 --> 01:01.867
you, you asked me to
go dancing immediately.

01:02.500 --> 01:03.833
Talk about romance.

01:03.900 --> 01:06.367
Uh, woman, we didn't have
any time for romance.

01:06.433 --> 01:07.900
My leg was soaking wet.

01:08.833 --> 01:10.733
-Captain romantic.
-Yeah.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.033
Well, it worked, didn't it?

01:14.867 --> 01:17.367
Yes, it did. [chuckles]

01:19.133 --> 01:21.333
And as they say, the
rest is history.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.200
[cheerful music]

01:42.733 --> 01:45.467

[blender whirring]

02:19.300 --> 02:20.533
Oh.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.667
[Melody] Good morning!

02:27.400 --> 02:29.300
Melody, my alarm is
set for seven.

02:29.467 --> 02:30.933
I still have three minutes.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.133
I know, I'm sorry.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.300
It's just I'm really excited.

02:33.367 --> 02:34.400
Are you excited?

02:34.833 --> 02:37.233
Yes, I'm, I, I'm very excited.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.400
Oh, thank you.

02:38.467 --> 02:40.167
[Melody] Today is a big day.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.500
You two are meant to be together

02:41.567 --> 02:42.833
and you're gonna finally
meet in person.

02:43.500 --> 02:44.300
What are you gonna wear?

02:44.367 --> 02:47.733
Uh, sweats, Chucks, you
know the drill.

02:48.533 --> 02:49.567
Sweats?

02:50.033 --> 02:51.867
First impressions
are everything.

02:52.167 --> 02:53.233
Okay, but if this
guy's gonna spend

02:53.333 --> 02:54.633
the rest of his life with me,

02:54.700 --> 02:56.333
shouldn't he know who
I am from the get-go?

02:56.700 --> 02:59.033
Okay, friend to friend, are
you sure you wanna wear sweats

02:59.133 --> 03:00.700
to meet the love of your life?

03:00.833 --> 03:01.867
Yes, I am.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.467
No more guys like my ex,

03:04.467 --> 03:06.500
or my ex before him.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.633
-Hmm.
-Ugh.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.700
I'm getting back out
there, but in my own way.

03:11.867 --> 03:12.733
Fair enough.

03:13.300 --> 03:14.167
Hmm.

03:14.467 --> 03:16.000
I know you've really been
looking forward to this.

03:16.833 --> 03:17.733
It's gonna be perfect.

03:18.467 --> 03:19.300
Thanks, Mel.

03:22.667 --> 03:25.033
Oh, by the way, I used
your new loofah,

03:25.133 --> 03:26.633
but it was kind of
moldy, so I threw it out.

03:27.033 --> 03:28.400
Mel, that is a sea sponge.

03:28.533 --> 03:29.500
That's what they look like.

03:32.467 --> 03:33.300
Cool.

03:33.733 --> 03:34.833
[cheerful music]

03:34.900 --> 03:37.533
[Jack grunting]

03:41.733 --> 03:44.567
[cheerful music]

03:45.400 --> 03:46.533
Never gets any easier, does it?

03:47.400 --> 03:49.333
You're lucky it's your
off day today. [chuckles]

03:50.000 --> 03:50.867
You just rest up, bud.

03:50.967 --> 03:52.300
How bet if I make you
some breakfast, all right?

03:52.700 --> 03:54.633
-That sound good?
-Yeah? Attaboy.

03:55.900 --> 03:58.633
[cheerful music]

04:00.033 --> 04:03.300
[car engines whirring]

04:05.700 --> 04:08.533
[cheerful music]

04:11.567 --> 04:12.800
Oh, good morning, Dr. Shaw.

04:12.867 --> 04:13.633
Good morning.

04:13.700 --> 04:14.900
You've got
gastroenteritis in room A,

04:15.000 --> 04:16.800
skin lumps in B, and
kennel cough in C.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.300
-Thank you, Tara.
-Of course.

04:18.667 --> 04:20.067
By the way, you need to
leave early today.

04:20.467 --> 04:22.300
You've got a meeting with
your wedding planner, 4 pm.

04:23.167 --> 04:24.400
-Great.
-Here’s what we’re gonna do,

04:24.733 --> 04:27.067
one more round of diagnostic
testing, little blood work,

04:27.167 --> 04:29.133
and an abdominal ultrasound,
and we will get to the bottom

04:29.333 --> 04:30.667
of what's going on with
Tiffany here.

04:31.133 --> 04:32.633
[Tiffany whimpers]

04:34.567 --> 04:36.367
Okay, Frankie, deep breaths.

04:36.467 --> 04:39.367
He's going to love you,
probably.

04:40.467 --> 04:41.300
Eventually.

04:42.667 --> 04:45.400
[cheerful music]

04:48.367 --> 04:49.233
[car door thumps]

04:52.133 --> 04:54.800
Frankie, you look just
like your picture.

04:55.667 --> 04:56.633
Thank you.

04:57.033 --> 05:00.333
So how do you motivate
yourself and others

05:00.400 --> 05:01.700
to accomplish tasks?

05:02.533 --> 05:04.867
I'm sorry, what does this
have to do with the process?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.167
A lot, actually.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.800
What's your daily schedule,
activities, hobbies?

05:13.533 --> 05:14.700
These questions are more intense

05:14.800 --> 05:16.800
than my gynecologist's office.
[laughs]

05:20.033 --> 05:20.867
[clears throat]

05:21.500 --> 05:23.733
Uh, I'm an editor at the
Boston Chronicle.

05:23.833 --> 05:25.800
I write all the local
wedding announcements.

05:26.167 --> 05:29.300
I also make anniversary
videos for couples.

05:30.033 --> 05:30.833
As far as hobbies go,

05:30.900 --> 05:33.333
I like anything outdoors
with my feet in the grass.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.133
And you think you're
ready to start a family?

05:36.500 --> 05:38.233
Well, my ex had a
really large family.

05:38.333 --> 05:42.467
He had brothers and sisters
and dogs, cats, a parakeet.

05:42.533 --> 05:44.900
It was really beautiful,
I miss that.

05:46.300 --> 05:49.033
[tranquil music]

05:51.000 --> 05:53.833
So you wanna come sit
on the sofa?

05:55.133 --> 05:55.967
Hm?

05:56.533 --> 06:00.133
[Tucker growling]

06:01.167 --> 06:02.000
Come on!

06:02.700 --> 06:04.467
[Tucker growling]

06:04.833 --> 06:06.200
Okay, I will come to you.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.333
That's cool.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.467
[tranquil music]

06:10.000 --> 06:12.200
-[Tucker barks]
-Okay, alone time it is.

06:14.633 --> 06:15.500
[Tucker barks]

06:19.533 --> 06:21.800
[Hazel] He didn't
even like dogs,

06:21.867 --> 06:24.367
not even my sweet Georgie.

06:24.667 --> 06:25.500
That's not true.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.533
I've always loved dogs.

06:28.467 --> 06:29.800
You have not.

06:30.233 --> 06:32.867
You just wanted to take
me out for a milkshake.

06:34.133 --> 06:35.100
Well, that may be true.

06:35.167 --> 06:36.900
I did want to take her
out for a milkshake.

06:38.467 --> 06:39.400
She's gorgeous.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.733
You trying to butter me up?

06:42.133 --> 06:43.800
The most beautiful girl
in the world.

06:44.833 --> 06:46.900
[Hazel] You're laying it
all pretty thick, Mister.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.200
[Tike] [chuckles] Is it working?

06:49.300 --> 06:50.133
[Hazel] Maybe.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.833
[playful music]

06:56.833 --> 06:59.067
[Melody] Hi, Tara, if I can
just have you sign here.

07:00.733 --> 07:01.567
Oh, ooh.

07:02.700 --> 07:05.000
[Melody laughing]

07:05.067 --> 07:06.367
-Sorry.
-Signature?

07:07.533 --> 07:08.500
Uh, here you go.

07:08.833 --> 07:09.833
-[Melody] Thank you.
-[Tara] Thanks.

07:11.033 --> 07:13.700
Um, I also wanted to ask, um,

07:14.833 --> 07:19.333
my roommate got a dog
recently and needs a vet.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.367
Oh, yeah, she should
definitely come in

07:21.467 --> 07:22.833
for an initial intake checkup.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.667
Uh, are you the point of contact
or should I get her number?

07:27.633 --> 07:30.300
Yeah, you can put me down as
the point of contact, yeah.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.200
Um, yeah, I'm a lot more
obsessive about my calendar.

07:33.300 --> 07:34.400
She's a lot more go
with the flow.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.700
I am the same way with plans.

07:36.367 --> 07:38.067
I love a good
down-to-the minute plan.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.533
A double confirmed plan,
the best.

07:40.900 --> 07:41.733
[Melody] Same.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.467
[playful music]

07:46.967 --> 07:49.867
This, all-flower wall.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.367
It is going to be so posh.

07:53.700 --> 07:56.467
500 meters of pink peonies.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.533
This, this whole wall is
gonna be flowers?

08:00.367 --> 08:01.733
It sounds like it's
gonna cost an arm and a-

08:01.833 --> 08:02.800
No one likes a buzz kill, Jack.

08:03.833 --> 08:04.667
Right.

08:06.133 --> 08:07.200
You guys are the experts.

08:07.300 --> 08:08.233
I'm sure it's gonna be-

08:08.333 --> 08:10.500
[Stacy and Nathaniel] So posh.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.800
Now tell me, are we still
locked on in no bridesmaids,

08:13.867 --> 08:15.000
no groomsmen thingy?

08:15.067 --> 08:16.500
Locked, I do not need

08:16.567 --> 08:18.200
a Pippa Middleton show
stealer moment.

08:18.300 --> 08:19.567
Oui, oui, oui.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.333
What about Boner?

08:21.400 --> 08:23.533
Uh, honey, I, I
think it's enough

08:23.633 --> 08:25.333
that Bonner's invited,
don't you?

08:26.033 --> 08:29.000
No, Stacy, he's been my best
friend for over 20 years.

08:29.067 --> 08:32.133
I know, but we can't ask
the calligraphy artist

08:32.200 --> 08:34.233
to write Boner in the program.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.900
Boner's just not posh.

08:41.867 --> 08:44.200
Okay, well, his actual
name is Travis Bernard.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.300
Can we put Travis on there?

08:46.967 --> 08:49.567
[playful music]

08:52.000 --> 08:52.867
Whatever you wanna do, babe.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.200
Now, let us talk about the
table settings.

08:56.867 --> 08:58.667
The waterfall napkins will be,

08:58.867 --> 09:00.733
[Stacy and Nathaniel] So posh.

09:01.067 --> 09:01.967
[Nathaniel speaking French]

09:03.667 --> 09:04.500
[chair thumps]

09:05.733 --> 09:07.133
[Frankie] Does it seem
like he likes me?

09:07.200 --> 09:09.167
I mean, I don't think he
really knows what he likes.

09:09.367 --> 09:10.800
He's really only been out
of the shelter

09:10.867 --> 09:11.733
for like four hours.

09:12.367 --> 09:13.967
At least you got some
sort of response from him.

09:14.033 --> 09:15.133
He barked when you got home.

09:15.833 --> 09:17.133
All dogs bark at me.

09:17.200 --> 09:17.967
I'm a delivery driver.

09:18.033 --> 09:19.233
It's basically in their DNA.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.333
Okay, listen to this.

09:20.400 --> 09:23.667
Tucker's dislikes: walks,
tennis balls, and chicken.

09:24.233 --> 09:25.633
Like, is he even a real dog?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.167
These things take time.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.167
Like think about how long it
took you to open up to me.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.200
That's true.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.033
I mean, you say that I
communicate too much,

09:32.333 --> 09:34.500
but my family group chat
is always blowing up.

09:34.900 --> 09:35.833
Definitely not my family.

09:36.133 --> 09:37.667
I'm lucky if my sister
remembers my birthday.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.300
Well, you always got me.

09:39.700 --> 09:40.533
You're stuck with me.

09:42.167 --> 09:43.533
But I do think that
maybe you should get back

09:43.633 --> 09:44.900
into the dating world
a little bit.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.567
Maybe Tucker could use a dad.

09:46.900 --> 09:47.733
Oh, a dad?

09:48.000 --> 09:48.867
Tucker would like a dad.

09:48.967 --> 09:51.667
Okay, can we just, you know,
take it one day at a time,

09:52.467 --> 09:53.300
like, bring it down?

09:56.133 --> 09:56.967
Fine.

10:03.133 --> 10:05.233
Hey, Stace, I'm sort of,

10:06.133 --> 10:08.567
I'm sort of, uh, bummed
out about the wedding.

10:10.467 --> 10:13.300
I know, it royally sucks
throughout of lemon curd.

10:16.067 --> 10:18.333
No, no, no, it's not,
it's not that.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.833
It's actually, um, the,
the whole wedding

10:21.300 --> 10:22.133
because it's just,

10:22.867 --> 10:26.400
it's just becoming so big,
you know?

10:26.500 --> 10:28.367
And so excessive.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.067
What's your idea of a
dream wedding, babe?

10:31.400 --> 10:32.700
Roll around in the hay
with your dog

10:32.800 --> 10:34.033
and spit seeds into a barrel?

10:35.400 --> 10:36.233
Come on.

10:37.367 --> 10:38.200
No.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.367
[Stacy] My father is paying
for this whole wedding, babe.

10:44.033 --> 10:44.967
It's his gift to us,

10:45.867 --> 10:48.867
just like that very expensive
sports car he gave you.

10:50.367 --> 10:51.800
I never asked for that car.

10:52.500 --> 10:53.900
[Stacy] But you look
hot in that car,

10:54.667 --> 10:56.533
and I like being seen
in that car with you.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.167
I don't wanna sound
ungrateful here--

10:59.233 --> 11:01.333
[Stacy] Okay, well, you
are sounding ungrateful.

we should get them together
and do a little play date

21:35.167 --> 21:36.000
in the park or something.

21:36.333 --> 21:38.033
Yeah, I, I could totally
meet you at the park

21:38.567 --> 21:40.467
-For the dogs.
-For the dogs, of course, yeah.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.300
-Okay.
-Okay.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.033
All right, well, I'm
gonna get going now.

21:44.467 --> 21:46.833
Uh, I actually neutered a
pup this morning

21:46.900 --> 21:50.167
and he's about to wake up and
realize what just happened.

21:50.233 --> 21:51.333
Oh, that's ruff.

21:51.400 --> 21:55.000
That's, I see what you
did there, that's good.

21:55.067 --> 21:56.000
Tucker'll be in in a moment.

21:56.067 --> 21:57.033
Sounds paw-fect.

21:57.300 --> 21:59.800
-Paw-fect?
-Oh, okay, two too many?

22:00.567 --> 22:01.400
Maybe.

22:02.867 --> 22:04.333
Why? Why?

22:06.633 --> 22:09.133
You really downplayed how
hot Dr. Jack is.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.467
I told you he was hot,
but you know,

22:11.533 --> 22:13.700
I actually think he's
like maybe too attractive.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.467
-I'm sorry, how is that a thing?
-[doorbell rings]

22:16.533 --> 22:17.900
Ding dong, ding dong!

22:18.000 --> 22:19.300
Oh, where are my two
favorite ladies?

22:19.900 --> 22:20.667
There you are.

22:20.733 --> 22:21.700
A little birdy called
me and told me

22:21.800 --> 22:22.800
that somebody met the one.

22:22.867 --> 22:24.667
I'm sure you just had
takeout, so I brought dinner

22:24.733 --> 22:26.000
and I wanna hear all about it.

22:26.533 --> 22:28.033
You called your mother and
told her I met the one?

22:28.200 --> 22:29.367
I didn't call her.

22:30.400 --> 22:31.233
I texted her.

22:32.333 --> 22:33.067
[Frankie laughs]

22:33.167 --> 22:34.867
I feel, I feel there's
something different about you,

22:34.967 --> 22:37.233
it's like a seismic energy
shift, it really is.

22:37.333 --> 22:38.067
What is it?

22:38.167 --> 22:39.900
Is it, is it, is it some
spice in your sex life?

22:40.000 --> 22:40.967
Mom, please stop.

22:41.567 --> 22:43.000
You be quiet, you came
outta my vagina.

22:43.067 --> 22:43.867
You're not allowed a say.

22:43.967 --> 22:44.667
Oh my God.

22:44.733 --> 22:45.833
[Katrina] Listen, there's
something happening.

22:45.900 --> 22:46.633
I'm sorry.

22:46.700 --> 22:49.167
[Katrina] It's something,
it's, it's spicy.

22:49.233 --> 22:50.700
It's spicy sex with this guy?

22:50.800 --> 22:51.733
-No spice.
-No spice.

22:51.833 --> 22:54.167
No, I met this guy for
like a half a second.

22:54.233 --> 22:55.900
-Yeah?
-It was perfection.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.333
-Yes?
-And then it wasn't.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.400
Classic, Frankie's running
the other direction

22:59.500 --> 23:01.033
as soon as she starts to
have feelings.

23:01.333 --> 23:02.467
Okay, classic Melody.

23:02.533 --> 23:03.567
I'm too scared to
pull the trigger,

23:03.667 --> 23:04.867
so I'm never gonna
ask a cute girl

23:04.967 --> 23:06.633
from the vet's office out
on a real date.

23:06.700 --> 23:09.067
Oh, uh-oh, that is not my girl.

23:09.167 --> 23:10.067
I raised you better than that.

23:10.167 --> 23:11.000
You go after your love.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.833
Fine, I will ask her if
you ask him, deal?

23:13.967 --> 23:16.900
Or how about I have my
love life under control?

23:18.133 --> 23:20.067
And you know what you can
help me with, actually?

23:20.333 --> 23:22.867
I'm going to throw a little
birthday party for Tucker.

23:23.167 --> 23:25.133
Apparently he's turning 14
in human years,

23:25.200 --> 23:26.300
which is super cute,

23:26.367 --> 23:28.533
so maybe we could throw
something intimate.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.300
Intimate, I like the
sounds of that.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.233
Mom, you should come.

23:31.633 --> 23:33.667
Oh no, I'm teaching sex
ed to the geriatrics

23:33.733 --> 23:35.667
at the old folks home, my
favorite class.

23:36.067 --> 23:37.833
Anyway, I will say this once

23:37.900 --> 23:39.200
and I will say it
again and again,

23:39.300 --> 23:40.833
the only thing
standing between you

23:41.300 --> 23:43.467
and your happily ever
after is, ladies?

23:44.333 --> 23:45.167
[Melody and Frankie] You!

23:46.300 --> 23:47.400
[Katrina and Melody laughing]

23:47.500 --> 23:48.667
Wait, this class-

23:48.733 --> 23:49.567
You're too young.

23:49.800 --> 23:52.133
[Frankie laughing]

23:53.500 --> 23:56.200
[tranquil music]

24:00.300 --> 24:01.800
[feet thudding]

24:01.867 --> 24:03.700
Wait, water break.

24:03.967 --> 24:04.800
-[Jack] What?
-Stat.

24:05.467 --> 24:08.567
Oh man, it's so hot, ooh.

24:08.733 --> 24:10.133
Yeah, well, the full
body sweatsuit

24:10.200 --> 24:11.167
probably isn't helping.

24:11.233 --> 24:12.067
How far did I go?

24:12.967 --> 24:13.800
Three quarters of a mile.

24:15.133 --> 24:16.367
How close is that to a 5K?

24:16.967 --> 24:18.733
-5K is only three miles.
-Only?

24:19.533 --> 24:23.233
Hey man, I still need to trim
a few lbs for your big day

24:23.800 --> 24:25.833
'cause you know it's gonna
be all eyes on the big Boner

24:25.900 --> 24:27.700
when I go strutting down
that aisle, boy.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.200
Yeah, I actually gotta
talk to you about that, um-

24:32.300 --> 24:33.133
[Boner] What?

24:33.900 --> 24:35.633
Well, Stacy doesn't think
I should have a best man.

24:36.700 --> 24:37.533
What do you mean?

24:38.000 --> 24:38.733
I don't know.

24:38.833 --> 24:40.000
It's got something to do
with the calligraphy artist,

24:40.067 --> 24:41.567
there's something, and
them writing things,

24:41.667 --> 24:43.367
and too many people
standing up there with us.

24:44.000 --> 24:44.833
Stacy thinks that-

24:44.900 --> 24:45.800
What do you think, Jack?

24:47.700 --> 24:48.533
I don't know, Boner.

24:49.300 --> 24:50.400
It's time you figured it out.

24:51.467 --> 24:54.033
Man, you lucky I'm a chill dude,
man.

24:54.133 --> 24:56.000
I could go Boner berserk
on you right now,

24:56.367 --> 24:59.833
like full on best manzilla,
but I won't.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.067
You can go Boner berserk
on me if you want to.

25:03.167 --> 25:06.333
Oh man, a true best man
stays true to this guy

25:06.400 --> 25:08.533
even after losing the
title, everybody knows that,

25:10.000 --> 25:11.667
but you do gotta let
me beat you in that 5K.

25:13.900 --> 25:14.833
-Deal.
-All right.

25:15.667 --> 25:16.900
You okay to run this last
leg on your own?

25:17.000 --> 25:17.800
I gotta go clear my head.

25:17.867 --> 25:19.133
Yeah, go ahead man, I got this.

25:19.300 --> 25:20.033
All right, love you, man.

25:20.133 --> 25:20.967
[Boner] Love you back, buddy.

25:21.167 --> 25:22.000
[hands clap together]

25:24.133 --> 25:26.200
[Jack] Keep running, no sitting!

25:26.300 --> 25:27.133
No sitting, I'm not sitting!

25:29.800 --> 25:33.233
[Tucker and Dakota barking]

25:33.467 --> 25:35.467
[Frankie] I have to say, I
am surprised he texted me.

25:35.967 --> 25:36.800
Really?

25:36.900 --> 25:38.800
I said, we gotta get these
dogs together for play date.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.000
Look at them, they
love each other.

25:41.233 --> 25:43.967
Yeah, I'm glad him and
Dakota are such good friends.

25:44.667 --> 25:45.967
They are certainly fast friends.

25:46.667 --> 25:48.067
I was actually thinking
about getting a second dog,

25:48.167 --> 25:50.300
but like I told you before,
I mean,

25:50.667 --> 25:52.967
Dakota's very picky about
the company that he keeps.

25:53.333 --> 25:54.167
How long have you had him?

25:54.567 --> 25:56.333
Um, since he was about this big.

25:57.133 --> 25:59.067
Yeah, I actually found
him in a gas station.

25:59.233 --> 26:01.167
I was, I was driving up to Maine

26:01.300 --> 26:03.367
to go to my best friend
Bonner's wedding,

26:03.467 --> 26:05.833
and pulling into this gas
station, and there he was,

26:05.900 --> 26:06.667
this little thing.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.567
He had his head buried in this
big bag of barbecue chips.

26:09.700 --> 26:10.700
[both laughing]

26:10.800 --> 26:11.733
-That's cute.
-Yeah.

26:12.667 --> 26:16.233
Okay, your friend Boner,
is that like a legal name?

26:16.333 --> 26:18.867
No, it's his preferred nickname.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.833
-That's incredible.
-It is.

26:21.800 --> 26:22.633
He's actually a great guy,

26:23.133 --> 26:26.367
but yeah, Dakota's been with
me ever since that trip.

26:26.867 --> 26:28.400
Hm, he's lucky to have you.

26:30.467 --> 26:32.300
Us humans don't always do
right by our animal friends.

26:32.367 --> 26:33.300
Yeah, I agree.

26:34.633 --> 26:36.800
I feel like adopting
Tucker was my way

26:36.867 --> 26:38.467
of doing my one small part.

26:39.333 --> 26:40.500
I don't know if it's
a small part.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.533
I think it's a pretty big
deal to Tucker.

26:44.467 --> 26:45.367
I'm hopeful, though.

26:45.467 --> 26:48.733
I had the best connection
with my ex' dog, I loved him.

26:49.800 --> 26:50.733
My ex, not so much.

26:53.667 --> 26:56.733
I've never been flat on
my face in love before.

26:59.567 --> 27:01.567
Flat on your face in love.

27:02.233 --> 27:03.700
That sounds so painful.

27:04.667 --> 27:06.300
I don't know, I just,

27:06.367 --> 27:08.867
I guess I've never really
let someone in.

27:09.833 --> 27:12.067
That way it doesn't hurt so
much when it doesn't work out.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.467
That was weird and personal.

27:15.533 --> 27:16.367
No, it wasn't weird.

27:17.333 --> 27:18.467
That makes perfect sense to me.

27:22.067 --> 27:24.733
[phone chiming]

27:26.300 --> 27:29.467
My assistant just can
never put it in one text.

27:29.533 --> 27:30.367
It's okay.

27:30.567 --> 27:31.400
Hold on.

27:32.233 --> 27:33.300
[phone chimes]

27:33.367 --> 27:34.200
Frankie, I gotta go.

27:35.233 --> 27:36.300
I gotta get back to the clinic.

27:36.367 --> 27:37.200
[Frankie] Okay.

27:37.300 --> 27:38.833
Can we finish this conversation
on our next play date?

27:39.300 --> 27:40.300
At the next play date.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.500
I'll, uh, sext you to set it up.

27:42.567 --> 27:43.400
What?

27:43.467 --> 27:46.367
Text you, I will text
you to set it up.

27:46.967 --> 27:47.733
Sounds good.

27:49.000 --> 27:49.833
God.

27:50.233 --> 27:51.967
Dakota! [whistles]

27:54.033 --> 27:56.333
[bouncy music]

28:03.633 --> 28:06.467
[door squeaks]

28:08.133 --> 28:08.967
Can I help you?

28:09.867 --> 28:10.700
Is Tara here?

28:10.800 --> 28:12.200
I, I have a delivery for her.

28:15.500 --> 28:16.700
You just missed her.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.633
She left 15 minutes ago,

28:19.300 --> 28:21.333
but I, I could, I could sign
that for you if you want.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.167
Did her schedule change?

28:23.700 --> 28:25.833
Ugh, there aren't any
paper towels in there.

28:26.867 --> 28:28.467
You can use the hand dryer.

28:29.333 --> 28:33.233
I won't be sticking these
into a tornado of hot germs.

28:34.667 --> 28:35.833
-[Jack] Hey!
-Hey, Jackie, babe!

28:36.033 --> 28:36.800
What's going on?

28:36.867 --> 28:38.033
I told you I wasn't working
at the clinic today.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.300
Oh, I totally spaced.

28:39.367 --> 28:40.400
You have a last
minute tux fitting.

28:40.567 --> 28:42.067
What? That fitting is today?

28:42.500 --> 28:43.400
Yes, ASAP.

28:43.733 --> 28:46.533
The tailor needs as much
time to snip and sew

28:46.633 --> 28:48.300
and make it fit this
body just right.

28:48.367 --> 28:49.067
Let’s go. [lips smack]

28:49.233 --> 28:50.067
Okay, okay.

29:00.533 --> 29:03.300
[cheerful music]

29:07.500 --> 29:09.467
Done, who's next?

29:13.000 --> 29:15.500
[tense music]

29:18.867 --> 29:21.967
[Tucker barking]

29:24.067 --> 29:24.867
What the?

29:24.967 --> 29:25.900
Tuck, it's me!

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
Ugh, oh, good, you're
already sitting.

29:29.567 --> 29:31.400
So listen up, the hot doc-

29:31.967 --> 29:33.000
[Melody and Frankie]
He's engaged.

29:34.500 --> 29:35.333
Wait, how did you know that?

29:36.033 --> 29:37.500
They are my next assignment.

29:37.900 --> 29:39.867
Did they send one of those
like inspirational videos

29:39.967 --> 29:41.033
or something to tell you
more about them?

29:41.467 --> 29:43.033
No, hang on, let me see.

29:46.700 --> 29:47.833
Hi, I'm Stacy Rue,

29:47.900 --> 29:52.133
and this is my handsome hunky
hubs to be, Dr. Jack Shaw.

29:53.033 --> 29:53.900
Hey, there.

29:53.967 --> 29:55.300
We met when we were
in fifth grade.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.667
He gave me a Fruit Roll-Up.

29:56.733 --> 29:57.800
What flavor was it honey?

29:57.900 --> 30:00.500
It was green apple and
it was so good,

30:00.567 --> 30:01.400
and we just loved-

30:01.567 --> 30:03.133
Okay, you know what?

30:03.200 --> 30:04.033
I will finish this later.

30:04.867 --> 30:05.700
It's fine.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.567
Ugh, I'm devastated for you.

30:08.533 --> 30:09.833
You think somebody else
at the Chronicle

30:09.900 --> 30:11.133
should maybe write
this instead?

30:11.467 --> 30:13.200
I don’t know. I, I don't know.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.833
why I am feeling any sort
of emotion right now.

30:16.500 --> 30:17.333
I'm not dating him.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.167
My dog is friends with his dog.

30:19.467 --> 30:20.200
He is my vet.

30:20.567 --> 30:21.700
Doesn't get more
platonic than that.

30:22.367 --> 30:24.667
We bagged poop together,
the end.

30:25.067 --> 30:26.400
Yeah, but there were sparks.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.000
Well, the sparks were
clearly in my head.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.033
Your head actually,
you are the one

30:30.133 --> 30:30.967
who came up with the sparks.

30:31.033 --> 30:32.900
I'm good, I have nothing,

30:33.000 --> 30:34.333
nothing, no emotion.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.633
Completely dead inside, so I'm,
I'm cool.

30:36.867 --> 30:37.733
I can write this piece

30:38.233 --> 30:41.633
professionally, objectively,
ugh.

30:42.567 --> 30:45.167
Yeah, doesn't really get
much worse than this.

30:46.900 --> 30:49.700
Except it, it kind of
does because I'm scheduled

30:49.800 --> 30:52.300
to do an in-person
interview with him tomorrow.

30:53.333 --> 30:54.200
Yeah, what am I gonna do?

30:57.233 --> 30:58.800
What, what, what is that face?

31:03.800 --> 31:05.567
Francesca, nice to meet you.

31:09.400 --> 31:10.367
Should we put you in
a trench coat?

31:11.367 --> 31:12.567
No, it's way to
Inspector Gadget.

31:13.467 --> 31:14.700
Should I really be doing this?

31:14.867 --> 31:17.633
Yes, Dr. Jack Shaw or Dr.
Jerk Shaw, or whatever,

31:17.833 --> 31:18.567
should have been up
front with you

31:18.667 --> 31:20.333
and told you he was off
the market, okay?

31:20.400 --> 31:21.400
Be careful who you mess with

31:21.500 --> 31:23.200
because I will deliver your
packages across the street.

31:23.867 --> 31:25.200
Melody, no, that is too far.

31:25.700 --> 31:27.033
Fine, the
orthodontist's next door.

31:28.533 --> 31:29.367
[Frankie] Woo!

31:31.300 --> 31:32.533
Ha-ha!

31:34.400 --> 31:35.233
Thoughts?

31:35.467 --> 31:36.300
Okay.

31:37.833 --> 31:39.367
Thank you so much for
meeting with us.

31:40.367 --> 31:41.200
Yeah, thank you so much.

31:41.967 --> 31:43.800
And I love your scarf, so chic.

31:43.967 --> 31:44.800
Thank you.

31:44.867 --> 31:46.900
Uh, now let us start at
the beginning.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.667
Uh, tell me your,
your love story.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.500
Ours is actually
really adorable.

31:52.567 --> 31:55.333
Jackie here gave me a Fruit
Roll-Up in the sixth grade,

31:55.400 --> 31:57.033
and it was love ever since.

31:57.200 --> 31:58.033
Yeah.

31:59.500 --> 32:03.200
Okay, I, I guess I was
hoping for more specifics

32:03.300 --> 32:04.900
to give the piece some passion.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.567
Uh, uh, when did you first
know you, you loved each other?

32:12.700 --> 32:14.633
[Jack] Uh...

32:14.700 --> 32:15.733
Tell her, sweetie.

32:15.833 --> 32:20.400
Okay, uh, where, where
are you from exactly?

32:20.500 --> 32:22.700
Because, um, because your
accent's a little, um-

32:23.000 --> 32:23.900
I'm up from Sweden.

32:24.667 --> 32:25.500
Sweden?

32:25.700 --> 32:26.533
Go on.

32:28.400 --> 32:31.400
Okay, well, we, we,

32:31.500 --> 32:33.900
well, it was middle
school, and we went to,

32:34.000 --> 32:34.733
and we went to the movies.

32:34.833 --> 32:35.833
We were holding hands in there.

32:35.900 --> 32:37.567
Right, that was it, definitely.

32:37.667 --> 32:39.700
Uh, wait, was it college?

32:40.033 --> 32:42.300
No, no, no, no, 'cause
college you were long distance

32:42.367 --> 32:43.967
and I was in my
sorority social chair.

32:44.033 --> 32:45.367
Big responsibility.

32:45.533 --> 32:46.367
Stacy's a natural leader.

32:46.467 --> 32:48.167
And Jackie, here's a
natural follower.

32:48.233 --> 32:49.500
That's why we fit just right.

32:51.067 --> 32:51.900
Yeah, just right.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.733
I basically locked him down
as soon as humanly possible.

32:54.833 --> 32:57.667
So just, like, say we're
soulmates or something,

32:57.733 --> 32:58.567
blah, blah, blah.

32:58.900 --> 33:02.700
Okie dokie, I'll, I'll
fill in some details

33:02.800 --> 33:03.867
to the blah, blah, blah.

33:03.967 --> 33:06.333
Oh, also, more urgently,
can you please be sure

33:06.400 --> 33:08.633
to spell the names of the
Prescott cousins correctly?

33:09.067 --> 33:11.200
They're politicians
and oil people,

33:11.300 --> 33:12.900
so they're weird about
media representation.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.633
-Yes.
-[phone chimes]

33:16.133 --> 33:19.300
Oh, and as far as great aunt
Ethel May goes, she's dead,

33:19.633 --> 33:21.800
but she has it in her will
that she must be mentioned

33:21.867 --> 33:24.233
in any published news
about the Prescott family.

33:24.867 --> 33:25.967
[Frankie] Oh, shoot.

33:26.833 --> 33:30.000
[suspenseful music]

33:30.067 --> 33:30.867
I do know you.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.367
-No.
-Frankie.

33:32.700 --> 33:33.533
Yes.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.033
Wait, you two know each other?

33:35.667 --> 33:36.500
-Yes.
-[Frankie] No.

33:36.567 --> 33:38.500
-Well, yes-
-No, sort of.

33:38.567 --> 33:39.633
Um, from the clinic.

33:39.833 --> 33:40.667
It's our dogs.

33:41.300 --> 33:42.733
Ugh, say no more.

33:42.833 --> 33:44.567
Dog people, they're
own subculture.

33:45.733 --> 33:48.800
Oh my God, apparently the
string quartet dropped out.

33:49.633 --> 33:50.467
Stand by.

33:51.633 --> 33:53.500
[bouncy music]

33:53.667 --> 33:54.933
Why didn't you tell me you
were writing this piece?

33:55.000 --> 33:55.867
Why didn't you tell me
you're engaged?

33:56.033 --> 33:58.067
You didn't even bother to
mention you were engaged?

33:58.400 --> 33:59.800
No, I didn't forget
to mention it.

33:59.867 --> 34:01.000
It just didn't come
up organically.

34:01.367 --> 34:02.633
And, and, and, and why
did you show up here,

34:02.700 --> 34:05.533
pretend to be somebody else
wearing the world's largest hat

34:05.667 --> 34:07.967
and sounding like the
third Mario brother?

34:08.167 --> 34:10.367
Okay, I am the one that
works with the newspaper.

34:10.467 --> 34:11.833
I will be asking the questions.

34:11.900 --> 34:12.833
Okay, well, ask away.

34:12.900 --> 34:13.800
I'm an open book.

34:13.900 --> 34:14.900
Ha, an open book?

34:15.467 --> 34:17.000
Okay, maybe you are
an open book,

34:17.067 --> 34:19.333
but you have a secret
chapter called I'm Engaged.

34:19.500 --> 34:21.400
Fair enough, look, I whiffed
on that one, all right?

34:21.500 --> 34:23.233
But as, as, as dog play
date acquaintances

34:23.333 --> 34:24.167
who only met up once,

34:24.500 --> 34:26.667
did we really owe each other
those kind of specifics?

34:27.367 --> 34:28.467
Nope, I guess not.

34:28.533 --> 34:30.967
Okay, and technically, I
barely know you.

34:31.200 --> 34:33.467
I mean, we met up, we
spent two hours together.

34:34.000 --> 34:34.833
Two hours, what's that?

34:34.900 --> 34:36.200
In the course of a lifetime,
it's nothing.

34:36.300 --> 34:37.133
It's like a blip.

34:37.300 --> 34:38.633
All I know is if I had a fiance,

34:38.700 --> 34:39.867
I definitely would've
mentioned that.

34:40.233 --> 34:42.467
Okay, well, you know, good
for you and your fake fiance.

34:42.533 --> 34:43.467
Congratulations, by the way.

34:43.533 --> 34:44.300
I'm very happy for you two.

34:44.367 --> 34:46.700
Are you actually taking a
shot at me for being single?

34:46.800 --> 34:47.533
No.

34:47.633 --> 34:48.800
I guess I can add smug
and condescending

34:48.867 --> 34:50.000
to the list of things I
know about you,

34:50.067 --> 34:52.133
which now include being engaged.

34:52.200 --> 34:54.967
I gotta tell you something,
Francesca, she's a real snake.

34:55.033 --> 34:57.167
Oh, she is a
hard-hitting journalist.

34:57.533 --> 35:00.033
Jackie, code orange, our
cellist has a hernia.

35:00.133 --> 35:00.967
We have to go.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.033
Okay, all right.

35:02.133 --> 35:04.700
Well, thank you so much for
your time today, Frank-cesca.

35:05.867 --> 35:07.000
Yes, thanks hon, tootles.

35:07.067 --> 35:08.000
We'll be in touch.

35:08.067 --> 35:09.200
I look forward to it.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.967
I can't wait to write
about you two love birds.

35:14.667 --> 35:18.167
[tranquil music]

35:18.233 --> 35:20.900
[Dakota panting]

35:22.300 --> 35:25.567
[tranquil music]

35:25.667 --> 35:27.667
All right, buddy, let's
take you off the leash.

35:28.333 --> 35:29.167
Go on.

35:32.067 --> 35:32.900
-[Boner] Oh, man.
-[Jack] There he is.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.500
I wonder if I'd run fast if
I was running towards donuts.

35:37.233 --> 35:39.400
Well, a desirable destination
is always a good motivator.

35:41.367 --> 35:43.067
Hey, you're running every day,
that’s the most important thing,

35:43.167 --> 35:44.033
It's habit building.

35:44.133 --> 35:45.233
Hey, come on man, give
me a wedding update,

35:45.867 --> 35:47.333
and please tell me it's better.

35:47.400 --> 35:48.233
It's better.

35:52.567 --> 35:53.700
I'm really in a pickle here,
Boner.

35:55.000 --> 35:55.833
Why do people say that?

35:56.533 --> 35:57.733
I'm in a pickle, I'm
really in a pickle.

35:57.833 --> 35:59.000
Are you really in a pickle?

35:59.400 --> 36:00.267
Just something my
grandmother used to say.

36:00.333 --> 36:01.167
That's why I say it.

36:01.233 --> 36:02.067
No, I totally get that.

36:02.167 --> 36:04.400
I've heard her say it a bunch
too, but think about it.

36:04.867 --> 36:07.967
I mean, a person stuck
inside of a pickle.

36:08.700 --> 36:09.967
That's terrifying, bro.

36:10.667 --> 36:12.133
Can you just let me say
what I was gonna say?

36:12.200 --> 36:14.200
I'm sorry, that would have
to be one huge pickle!

36:14.300 --> 36:15.167
Are you serious?

36:15.233 --> 36:16.200
Yes, I'm serious.

36:17.033 --> 36:18.533
All this pickle talk
making me hungry.

36:20.333 --> 36:21.367
I know, but you you was talking.

36:21.467 --> 36:22.800
Finish what you was, go ahead.

36:23.533 --> 36:24.733
I'm having second thoughts.

36:25.667 --> 36:26.567
About pickles?

36:27.200 --> 36:28.867
My wedding to Stacy.

36:29.033 --> 36:31.500
Oh, I wanna know, let it out,
bro!

36:31.700 --> 36:34.233
It's, it's not, it's not that,
that I wanna call it off.

36:34.333 --> 36:35.200
It's just that I'm,

36:36.467 --> 36:40.000
I'm thinking about that,
doing that.

36:40.067 --> 36:43.167
Look, if you not all in on
this wedding, bro, tap out now.

36:43.833 --> 36:45.500
Nobody will be upset with
you if you did.

36:45.567 --> 36:47.300
Yeah, except
everybody like Stacy

36:47.700 --> 36:49.733
and all the Prescotts
on the eastern seaboard,

36:50.533 --> 36:51.467
both dead and alive.

36:51.667 --> 36:52.867
[Dakota barking]

36:55.033 --> 36:56.733
Well, your real friends
and family ain't like that.

36:57.633 --> 36:59.367
Angela and I got your back
no matter what.

36:59.633 --> 37:00.467
You were right, man,

37:01.533 --> 37:02.900
Stacy and I don't have
anything in common.

37:04.833 --> 37:06.033
I don't think she's
the one for me.

37:06.300 --> 37:07.133
She's not.

37:07.667 --> 37:08.900
I do still care
about her though,

37:09.500 --> 37:12.400
but more of in a
nostalgic sort of way.

37:12.733 --> 37:13.700
Does that make any sense?

37:13.800 --> 37:15.300
Yeah, I still get warm and fuzzy

37:15.367 --> 37:17.033
around Atari and G.I. Joe,

37:17.500 --> 37:18.567
but I don't wanna marry 'em.

37:19.333 --> 37:20.200
We need toys.

37:20.867 --> 37:22.000
What would we even talk about?

37:22.633 --> 37:23.467
[Dakota barking]

37:25.967 --> 37:29.900
I just think that Stacy
and I've grown into people

37:30.000 --> 37:32.533
who just aren't a match
for each other anymore.

37:33.633 --> 37:34.900
[Dakota barking]

37:37.667 --> 37:39.400
Hey buddy, what's going on?

37:39.567 --> 37:40.533
-Oh my--
-[Boner] What happened to him?

37:40.867 --> 37:41.700
Totally messed up his paw.

37:41.800 --> 37:42.833
Must have jammed it
on something.

37:43.167 --> 37:44.067
Uh, I gotta get into the clinic.

37:44.167 --> 37:45.467
I don't have my keys.
I gotta call Tara.

37:45.967 --> 37:47.033
All right, call when you
get there, all right?

37:47.133 --> 37:47.967
Let's go, I got him.

37:49.133 --> 37:52.133
[melancholy music]

37:53.800 --> 37:57.133
[keys jingling]

37:57.200 --> 38:00.067
[melancholy music]

38:08.967 --> 38:09.800
[package thuds]

38:13.133 --> 38:14.000
You're here on a weekend.

38:14.733 --> 38:15.567
Hi.

38:16.700 --> 38:19.833
Hi, you look really nice
in your skivvies,

38:20.533 --> 38:21.700
in your civies.

38:23.033 --> 38:24.033
I'm, I'm sorry, my what?

38:24.533 --> 38:25.867
You're, you're not
wearing scrubs?

38:26.133 --> 38:28.400
I, I've never seen you in
regular clothes.

38:28.500 --> 38:31.233
Right, yeah, I had to open
the office for Dr. Jack.

38:31.700 --> 38:32.633
He needs to get into the clinic

38:32.700 --> 38:34.300
because his dog got
hurt pretty bad.

38:34.667 --> 38:36.700
Oh, I'm really sorry
to hear that.

38:37.300 --> 38:38.700
Uh, I can grab that package

38:38.800 --> 38:40.467
and just throw it behind
the desk, yeah.

38:43.033 --> 38:45.667
[suspenseful music]

38:45.733 --> 38:47.033
[Tara chuckles]

38:47.133 --> 38:48.000
[Melody] Um...

38:49.133 --> 38:50.333
Did you wanna ask me something?

38:50.967 --> 38:52.233
Yes, I, I do, yeah.

38:52.467 --> 38:57.833
Um, would you like to get
drinks sometime,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.167
or coffee, or we, we
can do like tacos

39:00.233 --> 39:02.300
or, or, or food if
you're hungry.

39:02.533 --> 39:03.567
Do you wanna take my number?

39:04.800 --> 39:06.500
Yes, I would love that.

39:07.367 --> 39:09.133
Great, um, yeah, I'll,
I'll put it in.

39:11.800 --> 39:12.833
[Frankie] That's terrible.

39:13.033 --> 39:13.967
Wait, what's terrible?

39:14.367 --> 39:15.633
The part where I have
to get a new data plan

39:15.700 --> 39:17.467
to keep up with Tara's
adorable texting sprees,

39:17.700 --> 39:20.000
which I'm happy to do, or
the part about Jack's dog?

39:20.333 --> 39:22.067
Obviously, the part
about Jack's dog.

39:23.967 --> 39:26.200
Are you thinking of making a-

39:26.400 --> 39:27.500
Frankie-feel-better basket?

39:28.067 --> 39:29.300
I think I should, right?

39:29.900 --> 39:30.900
For Dakota, not for Jack.

39:31.533 --> 39:32.367
For Dakota.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.867
I'm thinking maybe like my
regular basket,

39:34.967 --> 39:37.500
but doggy style, dog,
dog edition.

39:37.633 --> 39:38.800
Like a dog version.

39:39.133 --> 39:40.400
Freudian slip, I'll
let that pass.

39:42.467 --> 39:43.867
I know it's on your mind.

39:44.333 --> 39:48.033
[playful music]

39:48.133 --> 39:52.033
[car engines whirring]

39:52.133 --> 39:54.733
[playful music]

39:58.633 --> 39:59.467
Uh, can I help you?

40:00.400 --> 40:03.633
Hi, uh, do you by chance know
if Dr. Jack is still here?

40:03.700 --> 40:05.833
I have a little biscuit
bouquet for Dakota.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.700
Oh, he's gonna go
crazy for that.

40:08.400 --> 40:09.233
Uh, how do you know Jack?

40:09.633 --> 40:10.633
I'm Boner, by the way.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.967
Boner, the legend himself.

40:13.467 --> 40:14.900
Wow, uh, I'm Frankie.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.400
Jack's my vet, and I'm
also writing the piece

40:17.500 --> 40:19.167
about Jack and Stacy for
the Chronicle.

40:19.233 --> 40:20.067
Oh nice!

40:20.300 --> 40:21.167
Yeah, he should be right out.

40:21.233 --> 40:23.200
He's just finishing up
with some vet mumbo jumbo.

40:23.633 --> 40:26.467
Okay, well, I, I don't wanna
interrupt, so could you-

40:26.533 --> 40:27.800
Hey buddy, is Angela on a
way to get you?

40:27.967 --> 40:28.800
I'm about ready to-

40:29.800 --> 40:30.733
-Hi.
-Hi.

40:31.333 --> 40:33.800
Hey, how did, how did you
know I was gonna be here?

40:34.033 --> 40:35.700
Oh, my roommate ran into Tara,

40:36.000 --> 40:36.933
so I just wanted to drop off

40:37.000 --> 40:38.867
a little care
package for Dakota.

40:40.700 --> 40:42.700
Wow, thank you.

40:43.367 --> 40:46.067
Bar, barbecue chips, he's
gonna love this.

40:46.200 --> 40:47.567
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

40:48.500 --> 40:49.533
Give Dakota a squeeze for me.

40:50.067 --> 40:51.233
Let me know if you guys
need anything.

40:51.533 --> 40:52.367
-Okay.
-Okay.

40:53.033 --> 40:54.500
-It was nice meeting you.
-[Boner] Nice meeting you.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.233
Bye.

40:57.700 --> 40:58.533
Bye.

40:59.033 --> 40:59.867
Bye.

41:01.300 --> 41:02.967
Uh, quick question, uh,

41:03.033 --> 41:04.700
now, is it just the dogs
that like each other,

41:05.300 --> 41:09.500
or maybe, definitely, the
owners like each other too?

41:10.900 --> 41:11.733
What's matter with you?

41:12.233 --> 41:13.200
This is a nice gesture.

41:14.133 --> 41:16.167
Okay, doc, whatever you say.

41:17.067 --> 41:17.900
Hold this.

41:18.133 --> 41:18.967
Okay.

41:21.067 --> 41:24.067
[tranquil music]

41:28.133 --> 41:29.833
All right, buddy, here we go.

41:30.567 --> 41:32.333
Listen to me, I know you
hate it in here, all right?

41:32.800 --> 41:34.533
But just try to rest for
tonight, okay?

41:35.333 --> 41:36.167
Love you, pal.

41:36.467 --> 41:39.700
[tranquil music]

41:45.400 --> 41:46.233
[door clicks]

41:48.400 --> 41:49.233
[Jack sighs]

41:53.700 --> 41:55.967
Uh-uh-uh, don't touch it
until you wash your hands.

41:58.233 --> 41:59.200
Wow, you look rough.

42:03.833 --> 42:05.067
What, you're not excited
about your tux?

42:06.300 --> 42:08.133
This is really hurting my
feelings, Jack.

42:09.367 --> 42:11.167
I've told you how important
this wedding is to me

42:11.233 --> 42:12.333
and I've been doing
all this work

42:12.400 --> 42:13.967
to make it a beautiful
memory for us.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.500
Dakota hurt his paw
really bad tonight.

42:17.567 --> 42:18.567
Can I just have a minute,
please?

42:18.667 --> 42:21.967
Ugh, you know what, Jack?

42:22.500 --> 42:24.200
Sometimes I think you
care more about that dog

42:24.300 --> 42:25.133
than you do me.

42:26.033 --> 42:27.133
My needs are important too,

42:27.700 --> 42:29.867
so snap out of it
and support me.

42:32.667 --> 42:34.467
I'm not being followery
enough for you?

42:35.333 --> 42:36.167
What?

42:36.533 --> 42:37.667
That's what you called me
earlier, right?

42:37.733 --> 42:38.800
Said I was a follower.

42:40.333 --> 42:41.533
You know, you say you're
not a dog person,

42:41.633 --> 42:44.700
but you actually treat
me like I'm your dog

42:44.800 --> 42:48.067
most of the time, which
would make a lot of sense

42:48.167 --> 42:49.533
'cause that's what, that's
what dogs do, right?

42:49.633 --> 42:51.233
Dogs, dogs like to follow.

42:51.900 --> 42:53.067
"Propose to me on Christmas Eve,
Jack."

42:53.167 --> 42:53.900
I did that.

42:54.000 --> 42:54.733
"Make sure it's on a boat,
Jack."

42:54.833 --> 42:55.733
And I did that.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.500
Do this, Jack, do that, Jack,

42:57.867 --> 42:59.400
be this, Jack, be that, Jack.

42:59.567 --> 43:01.467
You know what?
I, I can't do it anymore.

43:01.667 --> 43:02.533
How dare you?

43:02.633 --> 43:04.233
-Am I wrong?
-You are so wrong.

43:04.333 --> 43:05.233
No, I'm not wrong.

43:05.833 --> 43:06.633
And you know what?

43:06.700 --> 43:08.700
I don't, I don't actually
need you to be a dog person,

43:09.367 --> 43:12.000
but it would be nice if you
were an empathetic person to me,

43:12.367 --> 43:13.633
and, and to Dakota.

43:14.167 --> 43:17.300
And, and, and it would be so
great if every once in a while

43:17.533 --> 43:21.033
you were someone who just
did normal things, you know?

43:21.133 --> 43:24.000
-Like, like eat sandwich bread.
-Okay.

43:24.333 --> 43:28.167
And admit to the fact
that you fart like ever.

43:28.867 --> 43:30.833
Although, although you
did fart and I heard it,

43:31.000 --> 43:32.967
100% heard you fart last
March, remember that?

43:33.300 --> 43:34.133
Yeah, that's right, baby.

43:34.200 --> 43:35.067
You had what? Food poisoning.

43:35.167 --> 43:37.667
Remember, you were all like
delirious and you let one rip,

43:38.067 --> 43:40.800
and it was big and it
stunk really bad.

43:40.867 --> 43:41.833
And you know what? It was great,

43:42.133 --> 43:43.467
because you were
a real person that night.

43:43.667 --> 43:44.400
So what, Jack?

43:45.133 --> 43:47.200
I don't, I don't pass enough gas

43:47.367 --> 43:48.833
to be worthy of
becoming your wife?

43:49.500 --> 43:51.233
This discussion is repugnant.

43:51.333 --> 43:53.500
No, this discussion is real,
okay?

43:53.700 --> 43:55.067
But, but, but we are not real.

43:55.333 --> 43:56.733
We are, we are, we, we
are two people

43:57.033 --> 43:58.667
that did the safest thing
that two people can do,

43:58.867 --> 43:59.967
we met when we were 12.

44:00.033 --> 44:02.067
We, we started dating and said,
that's it,

44:02.167 --> 44:03.667
let's just be together
for the rest of our lives.

44:05.300 --> 44:06.567
You know, I, I don't know

44:06.667 --> 44:08.733
what kind of midlife crisis
you're approaching right now,

44:08.833 --> 44:10.033
but it's a bad look for you.

44:10.800 --> 44:11.633
You know I'm right.

44:12.133 --> 44:13.067
You're not being honest
with yourself.

44:13.367 --> 44:16.033
No, no, you're wrong, okay?

44:16.133 --> 44:19.133
And now, now I'm getting pissed,
okay?

44:19.200 --> 44:20.567
My face is getting hot

44:20.667 --> 44:22.867
and this cooling snail mucin
gel is literally curling.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.500
I'm just, I'm so blindsided

44:28.567 --> 44:30.233
by this outburst of
immaturity from you.

44:30.567 --> 44:34.500
It's so false that it just,
it must just not be you,

44:35.000 --> 44:36.167
so I hope you sleep it off,
Jack.

44:36.233 --> 44:37.067
I'm not-

44:37.567 --> 44:39.133
Sleep? I'm not even
done talking.

44:40.067 --> 44:42.033
You always storm off when
I'm not done talking.

44:42.133 --> 44:43.367
Stacy, I'm not done talking.

44:43.467 --> 44:44.367
So keep talking then.

44:44.467 --> 44:45.333
No, I'm not gonna,

44:45.400 --> 44:46.467
no, no, no, don't get in
bed please 'cause you're-

44:46.733 --> 44:50.333
[Stacy snoring]

44:50.500 --> 44:52.300
[melancholy music]

44:57.467 --> 45:00.233
[uplifting music]

45:11.333 --> 45:12.167
[door thuds]

45:15.400 --> 45:17.300
[Stacy] Jack, breaks
my heart to say

45:17.367 --> 45:18.967
that you and I will never
see eye to eye

45:19.033 --> 45:20.833
on the things in life
that are most important.

45:21.667 --> 45:23.200
I think it's the end of
the road for us.

45:23.833 --> 45:26.500
I'm gonna stay at my parents
for a few days, Stacy.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.867
[melancholy music]

45:34.633 --> 45:36.400
Come on, Tuck, you've
been in there all night.

45:37.367 --> 45:38.833
Look, I have all these
leashes for you

45:38.900 --> 45:40.467
to try on for your party, huh?

45:41.667 --> 45:43.067
[Tucker whimpers]

45:43.167 --> 45:44.300
No, okay.

45:46.900 --> 45:48.067
What about food?

45:48.333 --> 45:51.533
You love food, bud.

45:55.967 --> 45:58.633
[phone buzzing]

45:59.800 --> 46:01.133
Hello, this is Frankie.

46:01.700 --> 46:04.700
Hello, Frankie, this is
Nathaniel Wethers,

46:05.000 --> 46:07.367
the coordinator of the
Rue/Shawn nuptials.

46:08.400 --> 46:09.867
[Frankie] Oh, hi.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.633
I had a bit of news.

46:12.167 --> 46:16.133
The wedding is
postponed.

46:17.633 --> 46:18.833
Indefinitely.

46:19.467 --> 46:20.667
You're out of a story,

46:21.367 --> 46:23.167
and I'm being forced to
let perfectly passed decor

46:23.233 --> 46:24.067
go to waste.

46:24.167 --> 46:26.367
Wait, Jack and Stacy
aren't getting married?

46:26.700 --> 46:30.300
A Prescott family PR rep called
me and told me to hold off

46:30.367 --> 46:32.300
and not run anything until
further notice.

46:32.667 --> 46:33.533
I see.

46:34.700 --> 46:38.333
Uh, do you, uh, by chance
know what happened?

46:39.200 --> 46:42.467
[chuckles] Well, off the record,

46:43.133 --> 46:44.700
Stacy told me her and
Jack were no more.

46:47.400 --> 46:48.967
I guess I should have
said off the record

46:49.033 --> 46:50.400
at the beginning of the call,
no?

46:50.500 --> 46:51.900
[chuckles] Oops.

46:53.200 --> 46:54.333
No, no, it, it's fine.

46:54.400 --> 46:56.467
I just, I hope
everything's okay.

46:57.633 --> 46:59.633
Uh, thank you so much for
letting me know.

47:00.167 --> 47:02.967
I hope you have another pair
to write about this week.

47:05.167 --> 47:06.967
Actually, I do.

47:07.700 --> 47:09.467
Uh, I have the perfect couple,

47:10.833 --> 47:12.300
but I could use your help
with something.

47:12.367 --> 47:14.467
What kind of extra decor
do you have lying around?

47:18.700 --> 47:19.533
[hand knocking]

47:21.967 --> 47:24.733
[uplifting music]

47:28.367 --> 47:29.200
Hey.

47:30.333 --> 47:31.367
-Come here, bro.
-What's up, man?

47:31.467 --> 47:32.300
Come here, man.

47:34.467 --> 47:35.500
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

47:36.333 --> 47:37.633
It's okay, I really
appreciate you

47:37.700 --> 47:38.733
letting us stay here
with you and Ang.

47:39.167 --> 47:40.533
Anytime, man, anytime.

47:41.400 --> 47:43.500
Look at you, you single for
the first time in forever.

47:43.800 --> 47:46.067
Yeah, I don't, I don't really
know what I am right now.

47:47.200 --> 47:48.200
Come on, let's go in there, man.

47:48.300 --> 47:49.700
Let's get this party started.

47:50.900 --> 47:53.700
[uplifting music]

47:55.533 --> 47:57.167
Get in this pool, man.

47:57.233 --> 47:58.367
What are you doing out here?

47:58.467 --> 47:59.367
Cheers.

47:59.567 --> 48:01.133
Cheers, I appreciate you, buddy.

48:01.200 --> 48:02.033
[Boner] Mm.

48:02.700 --> 48:03.533
Anytime.

48:06.233 --> 48:07.067
I got a question for you.

48:07.833 --> 48:08.667
All right, fire away.

48:09.533 --> 48:10.733
You think I'd be a good dog dad?

48:11.200 --> 48:12.467
I think you'd be the
best dog dad.

48:12.833 --> 48:14.067
Are you and Angela thinking
about getting a dog?

48:14.667 --> 48:17.067
Yeah, yeah, we, we
getting pretty close

48:17.167 --> 48:18.000
to something like that.

48:18.567 --> 48:19.400
That's awesome.

48:20.900 --> 48:22.567
Yeah, I guess I just hope
I do a good job

48:22.667 --> 48:24.800
of taking care of it,
like you do with Dakota.

48:28.367 --> 48:30.067
You're gonna do great, no
doubt about it.

48:31.333 --> 48:33.033
-You're right, I can do it.
-You can.

48:33.333 --> 48:34.967
-It's gonna be a big job though.
-Yeah, it is.

48:35.033 --> 48:36.667
But you dropped trou and
get in his pool.

48:36.733 --> 48:38.333
I'm not getting, I'm
not swimming.

48:38.400 --> 48:40.033
You swim now, we're
gonna be running later.

48:40.567 --> 48:41.833
No running, nope, nope!

48:42.333 --> 48:43.100
[Katrina] God, why don't
you put

48:43.167 --> 48:44.467
that down
and be in the moment?

48:44.967 --> 48:45.767
Last text, I promise.

48:45.833 --> 48:46.967
You are so lovesick.

48:47.033 --> 48:47.900
She really is.

48:48.033 --> 48:49.400
I don't think I've ever
seen her like this.

48:49.733 --> 48:50.567
I really am.

48:50.667 --> 48:51.900
It's just we've both
been so busy

48:52.000 --> 48:54.233
that our entire relationship's
just been on here.

48:54.500 --> 48:55.800
But she's coming to Tucker's.

48:56.167 --> 48:58.467
Speaking of, you did
invite Dr. Jack, right?

48:58.733 --> 48:59.567
[Katrina] Who?

48:59.733 --> 49:01.700
He's like the perfect human man,
okay?

49:01.800 --> 49:03.900
He's like a sexy
animal-loving doctor.

49:04.000 --> 49:04.967
Sexy animal-loving doctor?

49:05.167 --> 49:06.200
I like the sounds of it a lot.

49:06.300 --> 49:07.533
-And he's single.
-And he's single.

49:07.633 --> 49:08.533
Well, what more could you want?

49:08.800 --> 49:09.800
But there are things
I need to know

49:09.867 --> 49:10.900
like what if he
likes water beds?

49:11.333 --> 49:12.333
Oh, right.

49:12.500 --> 49:15.000
-Or listens to AM radio.
-Deep question.

49:15.167 --> 49:16.333
Or puts ketchup on steak.

49:16.533 --> 49:17.700
-[Katrina] No, who does that?
-Ew!

49:17.800 --> 49:20.133
Come on, how long are you
gonna keep this up for?

49:20.233 --> 49:21.800
Exactly, don't you feel
that little tug?

49:22.333 --> 49:23.733
There's a little tug
going on in your heart.

49:23.833 --> 49:25.233
It's saying it's the future.

49:25.333 --> 49:26.533
"Come to me, come to me.

49:26.633 --> 49:29.133
The past is the past
and the present is now."

49:29.300 --> 49:30.133
And you know what?

49:30.200 --> 49:31.400
The future is right
around the corner,

49:31.500 --> 49:32.333
faster than you think.

49:32.633 --> 49:34.500
-Yeah, date him, come on.
-Come on.

49:34.700 --> 49:35.533
[Melody] Date this guy.

49:35.700 --> 49:37.733
He was engaged.
It's very, it's very messy.

49:38.000 --> 49:38.833
Messy?

49:38.900 --> 49:40.000
Life is messy, honey.

49:41.900 --> 49:44.367
There's something
knocking at your door

49:44.467 --> 49:46.633
and it is a perhaps soulmate.

49:46.700 --> 49:47.467
I can't believe

49:47.533 --> 49:49.133
that you're not the least bit
interested in that, come on.

49:49.833 --> 49:51.333
Tucker's the only man I
really need in my life.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.033
You know you can have Tucker
and a human man too, right?

49:54.133 --> 49:55.800
That's very true,
that's very true.

49:55.900 --> 49:56.900
How are you gonna be
open to love

49:57.000 --> 49:59.700
if you don't find yourself
opening yourself open to love?

50:00.200 --> 50:01.033
Does that make any sense?

50:01.367 --> 50:02.300
-I think so.
-Okay, thanks.

50:02.533 --> 50:03.400
What about fate?

50:03.500 --> 50:05.700
What if I leave it up
to the stars?

50:05.967 --> 50:08.633
You're gonna leave it up to
luminous clusters of gas?

50:09.200 --> 50:09.967
No, I like fate.

50:10.033 --> 50:11.733
Fate, fate has its hand
and everything, you know?

50:11.833 --> 50:13.700
If you let it guide you, you'll
end up where you need to go.

50:13.900 --> 50:15.567
See, your mom is very wise.

50:15.667 --> 50:16.500
[Katrina] That's right.

50:16.567 --> 50:17.967
-Wise and a little bit--
-Don’t.

50:18.800 --> 50:20.700
Beautiful, so beautiful.

50:20.800 --> 50:21.967
-Yeah, that's right.
-So beautiful.

50:22.033 --> 50:22.833
That's the right one.

50:24.400 --> 50:25.833
You know, procrastination
is really cute

50:25.900 --> 50:28.067
when you're young, but
it's not so cute

50:28.167 --> 50:28.833
when you're hitting 40.

50:30.700 --> 50:32.567
I am 40 in like 10 years.

50:33.067 --> 50:34.400
Well, it comes faster
than you think.

50:34.500 --> 50:35.733
You know, you're older right
now than you were before.

50:36.333 --> 50:38.900
You're older now, and right now,
now,

50:39.300 --> 50:40.867
-now you’re older--
-[Melody] Mom, you're insane!

50:40.967 --> 50:42.000
Now you're older, now
you're older.

50:42.067 --> 50:43.533
Well, that's what happens
when you get to be my age,

50:43.633 --> 50:44.467
you get to be insane.

50:44.533 --> 50:45.667
You're right about that.

50:45.733 --> 50:48.567
Hey, listen, I love
you both, but I'm good.

50:49.033 --> 50:50.867
I am, I'm doing me.

50:51.900 --> 50:53.967
Okay, let's see if fate
sets us free.

50:54.567 --> 50:56.133
Huh, cheers to that.

50:56.300 --> 50:57.133
Cheers to that.

50:59.867 --> 51:01.167
[Boner and Angela laughing]

51:01.333 --> 51:02.667
Wait, are you gonna put
syrup on this thing?

51:02.733 --> 51:03.733
Okay, you catch it.

51:03.833 --> 51:05.700
[Boner and Angela laughing]

51:09.633 --> 51:11.233
[Jack] Morning, you two!

51:11.300 --> 51:12.367
[Angela] Hi!

51:12.467 --> 51:14.567
Wow, hey, we're gonna be outta
your hair soon, I promise.

51:14.800 --> 51:16.067
Oh no, it's fine.

51:16.400 --> 51:17.900
We love having you
and Dakota here.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.800
Yeah, man, stay as
long as you need.

51:20.233 --> 51:21.967
Dakota can heal and have a yard.

51:22.367 --> 51:23.567
We really don't mind,
you're family.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.067
Thanks, guys, I'm already
looking for a place though,

51:26.333 --> 51:28.333
and eventually, you will
need your guest room back.

51:29.533 --> 51:31.533
Oop, about that oop,

51:32.467 --> 51:33.733
something we should
probably tell you.

51:35.200 --> 51:37.400
-On three, right?
-One, two, three.

51:37.833 --> 51:38.867
[Boner and Angela]
We're pregnant.

51:39.067 --> 51:39.900
What?

51:40.000 --> 51:41.467
Well, I'm not pregnant,
she's pregnant,

51:41.833 --> 51:42.667
but I did help out.

51:43.133 --> 51:43.967
Are you-

51:44.133 --> 51:44.900
No way!

51:45.133 --> 51:45.900
Give me a hug.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.667
Come here, bring it in,
oh my goodness.

51:48.800 --> 51:50.000
I knew it, I knew it!

51:50.133 --> 51:51.900
Yesterday, all that talk
about you being a dog dad,

51:52.000 --> 51:53.300
that was all just a front man.

51:53.633 --> 51:54.900
-We're having a baby.
-A baby.

51:55.300 --> 51:56.133
Wow.

51:56.967 --> 51:58.833
I hope that you are
ready to be Uncle Jack.

51:58.900 --> 52:01.067
I am ready to be the best
Uncle Jack ever.

52:01.167 --> 52:02.167
When are you guys due?

52:02.233 --> 52:03.333
Um, six months,

52:03.467 --> 52:05.667
so we don't need the guest
room back until then.

52:05.800 --> 52:06.633
Is it a boy or girl?

52:07.067 --> 52:08.667
Oh, we want a full
surprise on that.

52:09.400 --> 52:10.233
That is so awesome.

52:10.333 --> 52:11.500
I'm so happy for you two!

52:12.567 --> 52:13.400
We love you, Jack.

52:13.833 --> 52:14.667
Love you guys too.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.133
Um, aren't you guys supposed
to be training for the 5K?

52:19.200 --> 52:20.200
Yeah, what, what do you
mean supposed to be?

52:20.300 --> 52:21.133
We're training, right,

52:21.367 --> 52:22.200
what are you wearing?

52:22.400 --> 52:23.367
Why would you bring that up?

52:24.133 --> 52:26.067
Two miles right now,
let's go, get dressed.

52:26.167 --> 52:26.933
Come on, we were
having a good time,

52:27.000 --> 52:27.733
we're talking about the baby,

52:27.833 --> 52:28.833
and how can you bring up-

52:28.900 --> 52:29.733
We're training!

52:29.833 --> 52:31.367
We was talking about
the baby and everything,

52:31.467 --> 52:32.467
everybody was happy.

52:32.800 --> 52:33.633
Thank you.

52:35.233 --> 52:36.067
All right, don't tell him.

52:36.167 --> 52:36.967
I won't.

52:39.367 --> 52:40.300
What do you guys think?

52:40.833 --> 52:41.667
That one.

52:41.800 --> 52:44.733
Now, that one is
exactly perfect,

52:45.033 --> 52:46.800
just like all the other
20 that you showed us.

52:46.867 --> 52:47.700
I don't know.

52:47.800 --> 52:49.633
I just, I want something
that's effortlessly cool.

52:49.700 --> 52:51.200
I want her to fall in
love with me.

52:51.300 --> 52:53.700
She is gonna love you
with or without clothes.

52:53.967 --> 52:54.800
Mom.

52:54.867 --> 52:56.867
I mean, get your mind out
of the gutter.

52:58.467 --> 52:59.900
The clothes do not
make the woman.

53:00.567 --> 53:01.400
You're beautiful.

53:01.833 --> 53:02.667
Thank you.

53:02.867 --> 53:03.700
-[phone ringing]
-Ooh.

53:04.500 --> 53:05.333
Oh no.

53:06.333 --> 53:07.167
It's her.

53:08.967 --> 53:09.800
Hello?

53:09.867 --> 53:11.133
How long do we think
she's gonna be gone?

53:11.200 --> 53:12.333
Well, how long is forever?

53:13.333 --> 53:14.167
I agree.

53:15.467 --> 53:16.300
[Player] Go!

53:19.500 --> 53:22.700
Can I ask you some, some
fatherly advice

53:22.800 --> 53:23.867
since you're gonna be a dad now?

53:24.300 --> 53:26.033
Yeah, sure, I can practice.

53:26.867 --> 53:27.700
What do you need, son?

53:29.967 --> 53:32.000
Well, I've been thinking
a lot about this girl.

53:32.667 --> 53:33.867
Who you thinking about buddy?

53:34.367 --> 53:35.200
Is it a hot celeb?

53:35.500 --> 53:36.533
Oh, I bet she hot.

53:36.867 --> 53:37.800
Is it Jennifer Lopez?

53:38.000 --> 53:38.900
No, Judy Dench.

53:39.300 --> 53:40.567
No, Judd Nelson.

53:40.800 --> 53:41.800
Will you just let me finish?

53:42.200 --> 53:43.133
Well, give me a hint.

53:43.200 --> 53:44.567
Does the name start
with the letter J?

53:44.700 --> 53:45.667
It's Frankie.

53:45.733 --> 53:48.000
Frankie, Frankie, barbecue,
chips and biscuits girl?

53:48.067 --> 53:48.900
Yes.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.333
I knew I saw something
between y'all.

53:50.567 --> 53:51.333
She is awesome.

53:51.400 --> 53:52.733
Now, she should be your
new girlfriend.

53:53.133 --> 53:54.367
Well, look, I don't,

53:55.067 --> 53:57.300
I don't know if she's
interested in me like that.

53:57.700 --> 53:58.800
You want me to gas you up, huh?

53:59.500 --> 54:02.000
See, it's rude to make
a man that looks like me

54:02.300 --> 54:04.867
reassure a guy that looks like
you that he's still got game.

54:05.467 --> 54:06.367
That's borderline bullying.

54:08.067 --> 54:09.900
I, I, I just never,

54:11.067 --> 54:12.667
I've never dated anyone
who's an adult, Boner.

54:13.733 --> 54:15.033
Okay, just shoot her a
text message.

54:15.133 --> 54:15.967
Say, "What's up?"

54:16.033 --> 54:17.200
Shoot her a text and say,
"What's up?"

54:17.567 --> 54:18.867
I can't do that, I'm
a grown man.

54:19.167 --> 54:20.000
Okay, I don't know.

54:20.400 --> 54:21.233
Put your spin on it.

54:21.733 --> 54:22.900
Yeah, see, but that's,
that's the thing.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.367
We're in this kind of
weird space right now

54:24.467 --> 54:25.633
where we're, we're friends,
you know?

54:25.700 --> 54:27.967
But I don't, I don't know
if she likes me like that.

54:28.033 --> 54:29.233
I mean, I, I think she likes me

54:29.333 --> 54:31.000
and I, I think I'm
interested in her,

54:31.067 --> 54:31.900
but I don't know, like,

54:32.000 --> 54:33.167
maybe I like her more
than she likes me

54:33.233 --> 54:34.000
and that would be awkward,

54:34.067 --> 54:35.000
or maybe she doesn't
like me at all,

54:35.067 --> 54:36.167
and then that would be
disappointing.

54:36.233 --> 54:37.633
You know, it's, it's
a very delicate dance.

54:37.800 --> 54:38.833
Yeah, nobody's ever
done it before.

54:38.900 --> 54:39.733
Let me see your phone.

54:39.833 --> 54:41.300
-What are you gonna do?
-Just let me see your phone.

54:41.367 --> 54:42.500
Are you gonna do a
little draft for me?

54:42.567 --> 54:43.533
Hey, apple pie.

54:43.867 --> 54:44.700
Wait, apple pie?

54:44.800 --> 54:45.867
Why you putting
apple pie in there?

54:46.233 --> 54:47.167
What are you, what
are you doing?

54:47.233 --> 54:48.067
All right, hey, can I
have it back?

54:48.367 --> 54:49.700
-Just be cool, I'm still, just-
-Can I have it back?

54:49.800 --> 54:50.633
Can I just have it?
Give it!

54:50.867 --> 54:52.333
Hey man, don't do that!
You pressed send?

54:52.633 --> 54:53.500
You just pressed send?

54:53.633 --> 54:55.033
-Yes.
-Why did you send that?

54:55.167 --> 54:56.000
[Boner] What?

54:56.200 --> 54:57.033
Apple pie?

54:57.567 --> 54:58.833
This is a terrible text.

55:00.567 --> 55:01.400
[phone chimes]

55:03.200 --> 55:05.867
[playful music]

55:09.300 --> 55:10.800
[Jack] You put a bunch of
random letters in there too.

55:10.867 --> 55:11.667
Look at this.

55:11.733 --> 55:13.233
That's from you trying to
snatch the phone back from me.

55:13.333 --> 55:14.233
Why would you do that?

55:14.533 --> 55:15.367
I just...

55:15.900 --> 55:16.733
Apple.

55:18.367 --> 55:19.200
Is that her?

55:19.300 --> 55:20.133
-Wait a minute.
-What'd she say?

55:20.200 --> 55:24.033
Hold on, she said "Hi, lol,
home slice.

55:24.300 --> 55:25.867
I'd love to meet you later."

55:26.467 --> 55:27.300
Still got it!

55:27.733 --> 55:28.633
I still got it.

55:29.300 --> 55:30.800
Oh man, I still got it.

55:30.967 --> 55:32.033
All right, all right,
finish warming up.

55:32.233 --> 55:33.067
Okay.

55:33.900 --> 55:36.667
[tranquil music]

55:40.067 --> 55:41.167
-[Jack] Boner!
-Okay.

55:44.167 --> 55:47.533
[tranquil music]

55:48.000 --> 55:50.533
So what's gonna happen to
the custom Italian tuxedo?

55:51.067 --> 55:54.167
Um, I think that'll
probably stay with Stacy.

55:55.167 --> 55:56.067
I know it sounds crazy,

55:56.167 --> 55:59.400
but she, she loves that tux.

56:00.033 --> 56:00.867
Okay.

56:01.867 --> 56:04.500
You know, I'm getting a
sense it's not in total shock

56:04.567 --> 56:06.233
that things didn't work
out between you two.

56:07.233 --> 56:09.000
Well, she's gonna
make a good wife

56:09.067 --> 56:12.500
for somebody that just isn't me.

56:13.800 --> 56:16.167
And everything that Stacy
and I had was in the past,

56:16.233 --> 56:18.467
and whenever we did talk
about the future,

56:18.533 --> 56:20.700
it just, we never
really aligned.

56:22.067 --> 56:22.900
In what way?

56:23.333 --> 56:26.967
Well, I always knew I
wanted a family, you know?

56:27.367 --> 56:28.200
I don't think deep down

56:28.633 --> 56:30.833
Stacy really thought
about that much.

56:31.967 --> 56:35.033
And I always wanted to
have three kids,

56:36.400 --> 56:38.167
and, you know, Stacy
wanted to have

56:38.700 --> 56:41.733
three international
vacations a year.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.233
Oh boy.

56:44.333 --> 56:46.200
Yeah, for me, vacations were
just going back and forth

56:46.300 --> 56:47.667
to the lake and swimming all day

56:47.733 --> 56:50.400
and eating cheese out of a can.

56:50.500 --> 56:52.067
Which by the way, if you
haven't tried,

56:52.700 --> 56:54.067
canned cheese,
highly underrated.

56:54.167 --> 56:54.900
Are you kidding?

56:55.000 --> 56:55.833
I love canned cheese.

56:55.900 --> 56:56.733
-Really?
-Yes.

56:56.833 --> 56:59.000
My whole family would have
canned cheese and crackers

56:59.067 --> 57:00.367
on all of our camping trips.

57:01.533 --> 57:02.367
Mm?

57:02.467 --> 57:03.300
[Jack] Yeah.

57:04.233 --> 57:06.233
You know, my parents
actually met

57:06.333 --> 57:07.867
hiking the Appalachian Trail,

57:09.067 --> 57:11.700
so all of our trips growing
up were all outdoors,

57:11.800 --> 57:14.133
just rope swings and the water.

57:14.667 --> 57:15.900
Just a simple life, you know?

57:16.333 --> 57:17.167
It was the best.

57:18.000 --> 57:18.833
That sounds perfect.

57:19.900 --> 57:20.833
How often do you see
your family?

57:22.167 --> 57:24.200
Uh, not ever.

57:25.067 --> 57:29.300
Actually, my parents passed
away right before I turned 14.

57:29.700 --> 57:33.167
And my sister and I, we don't
really have a relationship.

57:34.500 --> 57:36.633
I wish we did, but she's
not interested.

57:38.533 --> 57:41.633
I think maybe I remind
her of sad days,

57:43.633 --> 57:44.567
so it's just Tuck and me.

57:45.867 --> 57:48.467
So I hope his 14th birthday
goes a little bit better

57:48.533 --> 57:49.367
than mine did.

57:51.700 --> 57:53.033
You're a really strong person,
Frankie.

57:54.067 --> 57:55.067
I appreciate you saying that.

57:56.333 --> 57:57.400
I'm not really that strong.

57:57.500 --> 57:59.300
I just keep everything
locked up, you know?

57:59.367 --> 58:01.300
Airtight and sealed shut.

58:02.833 --> 58:03.667
I see.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.333
I don't let a lot of
people in here.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.633
Well, I feel honored to be
standing at the doorway then,

58:10.633 --> 58:14.367
you know, with the hopes of
maybe being invited in one day.

58:19.833 --> 58:20.900
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

58:23.367 --> 58:24.333
I have no plans tomorrow.

58:24.567 --> 58:25.400
No plans?

58:27.167 --> 58:29.533
Well, it is Tucker's
official birthday party.

58:29.833 --> 58:30.667
Mm.

58:32.867 --> 58:33.900
And he is the guest of honor,

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
but you're a close second
considering you saved his life,

58:38.833 --> 58:40.733
so if you and Dakota
would like to come by.

58:41.500 --> 58:42.833
Well, Dakota just get
out of his cone,

58:43.700 --> 58:45.333
and I know if he sees
Tucker, he's gonna go nuts,

58:45.400 --> 58:46.833
so I'll probably keep him home,

58:46.900 --> 58:50.167
but how about if I
just came solo?

58:51.733 --> 58:52.567
I would like that.

58:53.233 --> 58:54.067
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

58:55.367 --> 58:56.733
There is no pressure
to come though.

58:56.833 --> 58:58.233
You, you don't have to.

58:59.700 --> 59:00.533
I wanna be there.

59:01.200 --> 59:02.633
I wouldn't miss it for
anything in the world.

59:03.867 --> 59:04.700
You got a little
[speaks faintly].

59:04.833 --> 59:07.500
[Frankie and Jack chuckling]

59:08.733 --> 59:11.633
[tranquil music]

59:11.700 --> 59:13.567
What do we think about these,
Tuck, huh?

59:15.000 --> 59:16.900
Okay, one day you'll be
very impressed with me.

59:18.167 --> 59:19.033
Just not today.

59:19.567 --> 59:21.300
[Melody] It's happening.

59:21.533 --> 59:22.800
-What?
-I have the day off

59:22.867 --> 59:25.033
so I can finally go on
that date with Tara.

59:25.167 --> 59:27.000
It's like your gas
clusters are hard at work.

59:27.300 --> 59:29.367
She's planned a whole day
full of my favorite things.

59:29.467 --> 59:30.633
Like, who knows where
this could lead?

59:30.900 --> 59:32.667
Don't you think this is
moving a little fast?

59:33.800 --> 59:36.133
I know I could get my heart
pancaked by this girl,

59:37.500 --> 59:38.367
but I'm gonna go for it.

59:39.233 --> 59:40.067
Okay.

59:40.633 --> 59:41.700
You take that leap.

59:42.367 --> 59:43.833
All right, well, I will
see you later tonight,

59:43.900 --> 59:46.200
and hopefully with Tara.

59:48.800 --> 59:51.133
Uh, by the way, I did invite Dr.
Jack

59:51.200 --> 59:52.333
and he is stopping by.

59:53.400 --> 59:55.633
Frankie, yes, this is a leap!

59:55.867 --> 59:57.667
Well, it's like a little
mini leap, so.

59:58.033 --> 59:58.867
That's amazing.

1:00:01.333 --> 1:00:03.700
[Boner] 350 Degrees oven,
40 minutes.

1:00:06.167 --> 1:00:07.367
[dish clanks]

1:00:07.633 --> 1:00:08.467
[Jack] What are you making,
buddy?

1:00:09.233 --> 1:00:10.667
-Breakfast for dinner.
-Ooh.

1:00:10.733 --> 1:00:13.533
Angela's at a girl's night,
so Boner's cooking for one.

1:00:14.133 --> 1:00:15.167
Well, two, if you count Dakota.

1:00:15.533 --> 1:00:16.367
Are you with me?

1:00:17.033 --> 1:00:18.400
Look at you, you looking good.

1:00:18.667 --> 1:00:20.500
-Thanks man.
-Flowers are a good touch, nice.

1:00:20.867 --> 1:00:21.733
Yeah, I think I'm ready.

1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:23.533
-Oh, you ready.
-All right, I'm off then.

1:00:23.633 --> 1:00:25.233
All right, I'm not gonna
even wish you good luck

1:00:25.333 --> 1:00:26.167
'cause you don't need it.

1:00:26.300 --> 1:00:27.133
Have fun, champ.

1:00:27.300 --> 1:00:28.533
Thanks, man.
Love you, bro.

1:00:28.667 --> 1:00:29.733
-Love you back, man.
-All right.

1:00:32.133 --> 1:00:34.900
[cheerful music]

1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:36.167
[Dakota whimpers]

1:00:38.967 --> 1:00:39.800
Get that, Dakota.

1:00:41.967 --> 1:00:44.667
[cheerful music]

1:00:45.900 --> 1:00:49.067
[car engine whirring]

1:00:51.867 --> 1:00:54.633
[cheerful music]

1:01:07.867 --> 1:01:10.667
[cheerful music]

1:01:12.900 --> 1:01:16.067
[car engine whirring]

1:01:26.200 --> 1:01:27.233
[cheerful music]

1:01:27.333 --> 1:01:28.533
Not today, it ain't.

1:01:31.900 --> 1:01:33.000
[Boner laughing]

1:01:38.033 --> 1:01:38.867
What the?

1:01:39.733 --> 1:01:40.833
Whoa, oh!

1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:42.867
[Boner coughing]

1:01:43.367 --> 1:01:44.667
[smoke alarm beeping]

1:01:44.733 --> 1:01:45.567
Oh, man.

1:01:48.067 --> 1:01:49.233
Oh, man!

1:01:49.367 --> 1:01:50.400
[Boner coughing]

1:01:50.500 --> 1:01:51.800
Dakota, call 911!

1:01:52.500 --> 1:01:55.133
[alarm beeping]

1:01:59.300 --> 1:02:02.067
Dakota, I messed up the
casserole so I'm ordering pizza.

1:02:04.533 --> 1:02:05.367
Dakota?

1:02:06.967 --> 1:02:07.800
Dakota!

1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.133
[suspenseful music]

1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:12.033
Oh, no!

1:02:15.467 --> 1:02:16.300
Dakota!

1:02:19.633 --> 1:02:22.167
[tense music]

1:02:22.233 --> 1:02:24.067
[feet stomping]

1:02:25.733 --> 1:02:27.167
[dramatic music]

1:02:27.233 --> 1:02:28.067
Dakota!

1:02:29.733 --> 1:02:32.400
[Boner panting]

1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:37.200
[phone ringing]

1:02:37.700 --> 1:02:38.533
What's up, buddy?

1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.133
Dakota got out and I
don't know where he is.

1:02:42.233 --> 1:02:43.967
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:02:44.367 --> 1:02:45.200
I'm gonna find him.

1:02:45.300 --> 1:02:46.133
Did you see which way you went?

1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:49.167
[Boner] No, no, I'm
gonna get that dog.

1:02:49.567 --> 1:02:50.400
I'm gonna go get that dog.

1:02:50.500 --> 1:02:51.333
I'm on it.

1:02:52.167 --> 1:02:54.633
[tense music]

1:02:58.733 --> 1:03:00.167
[Boner] Dakota!

1:03:01.533 --> 1:03:04.400
[melancholy music]

1:03:12.033 --> 1:03:13.800
This is why I don't
take the leap.

1:03:15.567 --> 1:03:19.067
[melancholy music]

1:03:19.167 --> 1:03:20.467
[noise maker tooting]

1:03:20.667 --> 1:03:23.533
[melancholy music]

1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:33.233
Dakota!

1:03:35.567 --> 1:03:36.400
Dakota!

1:03:38.067 --> 1:03:41.000
[melancholy music]

1:03:41.300 --> 1:03:44.867
[tires screeching]

1:03:44.967 --> 1:03:47.867
[melancholy music]

1:04:02.900 --> 1:04:06.667
[melancholy music continues]

1:04:09.567 --> 1:04:10.400
Dakota!

1:04:13.067 --> 1:04:13.900
Dakota!

1:04:17.033 --> 1:04:18.233
[phone ringing]

1:04:19.033 --> 1:04:20.233
Stacy, I can't talk to
you right now.

1:04:20.800 --> 1:04:23.733
If you're looking for someone,
I think I know where he is.

1:04:25.167 --> 1:04:28.067
[melancholy music]

1:04:34.233 --> 1:04:36.900
[feet stomping]

1:04:39.867 --> 1:04:40.700
[car door thumps]

1:04:41.667 --> 1:04:42.500
Hey.

1:04:43.033 --> 1:04:43.867
Hey.

1:04:44.533 --> 1:04:47.367
Came by to grab a few things
and he was at my back doorstep.

1:04:47.467 --> 1:04:49.200
[Dakota panting]

1:04:50.833 --> 1:04:52.467
Hey buddy, you know
better than that.

1:04:52.533 --> 1:04:53.367
Get off the couch.

1:04:53.467 --> 1:04:54.300
That's fine.

1:04:57.367 --> 1:04:58.200
It's fine?

1:04:59.133 --> 1:04:59.967
Since when?

1:05:00.133 --> 1:05:00.967
Since now.

1:05:01.733 --> 1:05:02.567
Who cares?

1:05:06.033 --> 1:05:07.233
I've got a soul in here.

1:05:07.533 --> 1:05:10.700
Okay, well thanks
for calling me.

1:05:12.067 --> 1:05:12.900
We gotta get going.

1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:14.133
I actually have to be somewhere.

1:05:14.233 --> 1:05:15.133
Uh, Jack.

1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:19.833
These last few days,

1:05:20.033 --> 1:05:21.733
I've thought a lot about things.

1:05:22.900 --> 1:05:23.733
What about you?

1:05:24.567 --> 1:05:26.467
Yeah, yeah, I've thought
a lot about things too.

1:05:28.067 --> 1:05:31.300
And you were right, at times
I have been a follower,

1:05:33.333 --> 1:05:34.967
but I also started a
successful business

1:05:35.733 --> 1:05:36.633
and I've been a leader there,

1:05:37.367 --> 1:05:40.167
and I've taken care of a lot
of animals and a lot of dogs,

1:05:40.233 --> 1:05:43.200
and, and regular old
people mean a lot to me.

1:05:43.967 --> 1:05:47.200
[melancholy music]

1:05:47.300 --> 1:05:48.867
You never wanted to be Mrs.
Shaw.

1:05:51.133 --> 1:05:51.900
That's how I know

1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:53.967
that this is definitely
the end of the road for us.

1:05:56.467 --> 1:05:57.300
This is really it.

1:05:58.500 --> 1:06:01.367
[melancholy music]

1:06:03.067 --> 1:06:05.033
Copy, plan B it is.

1:06:05.400 --> 1:06:06.500
Dylan, you can come out now.

1:06:12.300 --> 1:06:14.300
Hey, Dr. Shaw.

1:06:15.233 --> 1:06:16.067
Dylan?

1:06:16.167 --> 1:06:18.967
Yes, after you and I
called off the wedding,

1:06:19.033 --> 1:06:20.467
Dylan and I accidentally had sex

1:06:20.533 --> 1:06:23.700
in the medical supply closet
at your office three times.

1:06:23.800 --> 1:06:24.633
Five times.

1:06:28.967 --> 1:06:31.233
You're not gonna fire me
for this, are you, doc?

1:06:33.900 --> 1:06:35.567
[Jack laughs]

1:06:36.733 --> 1:06:39.467
[cheerful music]

1:06:40.400 --> 1:06:42.567
[phone ringing]

1:06:42.867 --> 1:06:45.300
-Yeah.
-Hey, I got him, he's fine.

1:06:45.667 --> 1:06:48.700
Holy cannoli, I'm sorry
I left the door open.

1:06:49.033 --> 1:06:50.067
It was an accident.

1:06:50.167 --> 1:06:50.900
It's all good.

1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:52.633
I mean it, don't beat
yourself up over it, okay?

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:54.233
Have you been running
this whole time?

1:06:54.833 --> 1:06:56.633
I don't know, have I?

1:06:56.800 --> 1:06:59.367
Check your steps on your
phone, the app for the 5K.

1:06:59.667 --> 1:07:00.500
Okay, hold on.

1:07:04.367 --> 1:07:06.533
It says 5.3 miles.

1:07:06.967 --> 1:07:08.000
How many Ks is that?

1:07:08.467 --> 1:07:10.567
Boner, you just ran 8.5
kilometers, buddy.

1:07:10.800 --> 1:07:12.400
What? That's crazy.

1:07:12.833 --> 1:07:14.633
[Jack] Good job, man, good job.

1:07:15.200 --> 1:07:16.633
I definitely tore up
these hammies.

1:07:17.067 --> 1:07:19.400
Oh, oh good, that you found him.

1:07:19.900 --> 1:07:21.133
Okay, good.

1:07:21.867 --> 1:07:24.467
[Boner groaning]

1:07:24.900 --> 1:07:27.700
[cheerful music]

1:07:30.333 --> 1:07:33.500
[car engine whirring]

1:07:35.867 --> 1:07:36.700
[Frankie sighs]

1:07:41.733 --> 1:07:43.867
[phone buzzing]

1:07:49.033 --> 1:07:49.867
[phone chimes]

1:07:51.133 --> 1:07:52.867
[Frankie sighs]

1:07:52.967 --> 1:07:54.167
[Melody] Hey, lady,
date's still going.

1:07:54.233 --> 1:07:55.567
We completely lost
track of time.

1:07:55.733 --> 1:07:56.700
Heading to Tara's now.

1:07:56.800 --> 1:07:58.800
Ugh, I'm gonna miss the
party and I'm really sorry.

1:07:59.133 --> 1:08:00.333
Hope you're having fun
with Jack though

1:08:00.400 --> 1:08:01.333
and I'll see you in the morning.

1:08:01.967 --> 1:08:04.833
[melancholy music]

1:08:08.167 --> 1:08:11.567
[sheets rustling]

1:08:11.667 --> 1:08:14.533
[melancholy music]

1:08:16.233 --> 1:08:18.867
[phone buzzing]

1:08:21.800 --> 1:08:22.633
Hi.

1:08:22.700 --> 1:08:25.500
Listen, I, I am obviously
running horribly late

1:08:25.567 --> 1:08:27.633
to Tucker's birthday
party, but I am on my way.

1:08:27.700 --> 1:08:30.667
Uh, the craziest thing
happened, Dakota got out.

1:08:31.167 --> 1:08:32.033
Anyway, he ran to Stacy's.

1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:33.033
I had to get him from there.

1:08:33.133 --> 1:08:34.400
Jack, it's fine.

1:08:34.567 --> 1:08:35.500
You don't have to come by.

1:08:35.667 --> 1:08:37.467
No, no, no, I, I
actually wanna come.

1:08:37.533 --> 1:08:39.333
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm on my way.

1:08:39.400 --> 1:08:41.567
I am very familiar with
people not showing up.

1:08:41.967 --> 1:08:43.500
This, this, this is
not like that.

1:08:43.667 --> 1:08:45.867
Two weeks from today you were
set to marry someone else.

1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.567
This is too much way too soon.

1:08:48.900 --> 1:08:49.967
How do I fix it?

1:08:50.233 --> 1:08:51.200
There's nothing to fix.

1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:53.733
Honestly, it's not even
about you, it's about me.

1:08:53.833 --> 1:08:56.833
I am, I'm done letting
people disappoint me.

1:08:56.900 --> 1:08:58.533
[Jack] Sounds like you're
pulling a Tucker here, Frankie.

1:08:58.633 --> 1:09:00.967
Oh Tucker, the dog who
wants nothing to do with me?

1:09:01.033 --> 1:09:01.867
How so, Jack?

1:09:02.367 --> 1:09:04.167
You're retreating
into your crate.

1:09:04.533 --> 1:09:06.467
Well, maybe I feel
safe in my crate.

1:09:06.533 --> 1:09:09.033
Maybe my crate is only
big enough for me.

1:09:12.133 --> 1:09:13.133
[Jack] So that's it,
you're just-

1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:14.033
Yeah.

1:09:14.500 --> 1:09:15.567
[Jack] You're gonna just
spend the rest of your life

1:09:15.667 --> 1:09:16.800
by yourself in your crate?

1:09:17.567 --> 1:09:19.500
And yes, you should answer that.

1:09:21.633 --> 1:09:22.667
[Frankie sighs]

1:09:24.533 --> 1:09:25.733
[hand knocking]

1:09:29.667 --> 1:09:30.500
Hi.

1:09:30.567 --> 1:09:32.700
Hi, I told you you don't
need to come by.

1:09:32.833 --> 1:09:34.133
No, but I did need to come by

1:09:34.200 --> 1:09:35.033
'cause if we could
just stay here

1:09:35.133 --> 1:09:36.400
with the whole crate
metaphor for a minute,

1:09:37.033 --> 1:09:38.633
um, I don't wanna sound crazy,

1:09:39.067 --> 1:09:40.833
but what about if we try
a co-create situation?

1:09:41.067 --> 1:09:41.900
[Frankie] What?

1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:43.500
No, co-crate situation.

1:09:43.567 --> 1:09:45.467
Jack, I'm sure there are
plenty of adorable dogs

1:09:45.533 --> 1:09:47.533
who would love to share a
crate with you.

1:09:47.667 --> 1:09:49.067
You will have no
problem with that.

1:09:49.167 --> 1:09:51.900
I just happen to be the
first one you ran into

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:52.867
in the middle of the street.

1:09:52.967 --> 1:09:55.133
No, no, no, no, no, no, it's,
it's, it's not like that.

1:09:55.200 --> 1:09:57.700
It's, it's, it's actually
way, way more than that, um,

1:09:58.400 --> 1:10:02.200
because the truth is, Frankie,
I, I-

1:10:02.500 --> 1:10:04.467
Jack, it's late.

1:10:05.467 --> 1:10:06.567
We're all good here.

1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.300
Okay, all right.

1:10:11.900 --> 1:10:13.167
Take care of yourself, okay?

1:10:15.367 --> 1:10:16.567
Good night.

1:10:16.867 --> 1:10:19.333
[melancholy music]

1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:20.233
[door thuds]

1:10:22.167 --> 1:10:25.000
[melancholy music]

1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:26.833
Good night, Frankie.

1:10:28.467 --> 1:10:30.567
[melancholy music]

1:10:30.667 --> 1:10:33.300
[feet stomping]

1:10:37.733 --> 1:10:40.967
[bouquet thudding]

1:10:41.033 --> 1:10:43.900
[melancholy music]

1:10:50.700 --> 1:10:51.533
[car door thuds]

1:10:56.400 --> 1:10:58.800
[suitcase thumping]

1:10:58.867 --> 1:11:00.867
[laughing]

1:11:01.867 --> 1:11:03.300
Hello, ladies.

1:11:03.533 --> 1:11:04.867
Where are you, uh, going?

1:11:05.233 --> 1:11:07.033
I'm taking fate into
my own hands.

1:11:07.467 --> 1:11:09.367
I'm moving out, hiking
the Appalachian Trail.

1:11:10.467 --> 1:11:11.333
You're what?

1:11:11.833 --> 1:11:14.867
Uh, I'm going to go use
the bathroom.

1:11:17.633 --> 1:11:18.667
I, I don't understand.

1:11:19.567 --> 1:11:20.567
Is this because of Jack?

1:11:20.700 --> 1:11:22.467
No, no, no, no, I'm
gonna take a little time

1:11:22.900 --> 1:11:23.800
and figure out my stuff.

1:11:24.333 --> 1:11:26.333
And honestly, I, I'm so
sick of listening to people

1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:28.033
talk about their happily
ever after, so.

1:11:28.567 --> 1:11:29.533
You're quitting your job?

1:11:30.067 --> 1:11:31.333
Yeah, I am.

1:11:32.367 --> 1:11:33.200
But first I'm gonna go

1:11:33.300 --> 1:11:35.200
to this sweet old couple's
vow renewal at the beach

1:11:35.300 --> 1:11:37.400
'cause they're so adorable and
I have a surprise for them,

1:11:37.867 --> 1:11:38.700
and then I'm out.

1:11:41.367 --> 1:11:42.200
Come on, Tuck.

1:11:42.533 --> 1:11:43.367
We gotta go, buddy.

1:11:44.067 --> 1:11:44.867
[Tucker panting]

1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:46.400
Tucker, we have to go.

1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:49.967
[gentle music]

1:11:53.167 --> 1:11:54.633
Mel, can you please
watch Tucker?

1:11:55.033 --> 1:11:56.133
Yeah, of course.

1:11:56.700 --> 1:11:58.833
Clearly, he doesn't wanna
come with me right now, so.

1:12:00.867 --> 1:12:03.467
[Melody sighs]

1:12:05.300 --> 1:12:07.200
[door creaking]

1:12:11.333 --> 1:12:12.567
[Tucker barking]

1:12:12.733 --> 1:12:14.000
Now you do this?

1:12:14.967 --> 1:12:17.500
[gentle music]

1:12:21.867 --> 1:12:23.967
Hey, how's it going in here?

1:12:24.967 --> 1:12:27.567
[sighs] Apparently you
have to wash the onesies

1:12:27.700 --> 1:12:28.867
before the baby shows up.

1:12:30.167 --> 1:12:31.400
The to-do list grows.

1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:33.967
Well, Boner will have
plenty of time to help you

1:12:34.033 --> 1:12:36.667
after the race today, and I'm
always a phone call away, too.

1:12:41.367 --> 1:12:42.700
Pretty wild week for you, huh?

1:12:43.533 --> 1:12:45.567
Yeah, it's been, it's
been a week,

1:12:46.900 --> 1:12:48.300
but everybody's happy now, so.

1:12:49.867 --> 1:12:53.900
Hm, I wouldn't say everybody.

1:12:56.633 --> 1:12:57.800
You aim to please, Jack,

1:12:58.700 --> 1:13:01.833
and that is what makes you a
good doctor and a good person.

1:13:03.867 --> 1:13:05.400
I just wonder,

1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:09.967
maybe it doesn't have to
be done-done with Frankie.

1:13:10.367 --> 1:13:11.400
She gave me the boot, Ang.

1:13:11.833 --> 1:13:14.067
I don't, I don't think
she's too interested.

1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:18.133
But you deserve happiness too,

1:13:19.867 --> 1:13:22.733
and I know that I'm an overly
emotional pregnant lady,

1:13:24.033 --> 1:13:27.533
I have seen you fight to
help so many over the years,

1:13:28.667 --> 1:13:32.000
Boner, me, thousands of animals.

1:13:33.667 --> 1:13:36.067
Go fight for the girl
that you want.

1:13:37.033 --> 1:13:39.567
[gentle music]

1:13:41.700 --> 1:13:42.533
You know I'm right.

1:13:42.633 --> 1:13:43.500
Now go eat something.

1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:46.633
[gentle music]

1:13:46.700 --> 1:13:47.533
Love you, Ang.

1:13:48.867 --> 1:13:51.400
[gentle music]

1:13:54.300 --> 1:13:55.867
[Nathaniel] Here we go!

1:13:55.967 --> 1:13:58.967
And the steps, decorative
wall flying in.

1:13:59.733 --> 1:14:00.567
Okay.

1:14:02.700 --> 1:14:03.533
Here we go.

1:14:04.167 --> 1:14:05.000
Hi.

1:14:05.067 --> 1:14:05.900
[Nathaniel] To, to, to, to, to,
to.

1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:07.300
[bouncy music]

1:14:07.367 --> 1:14:08.233
What is all of this?

1:14:08.367 --> 1:14:09.200
My goodness.

1:14:09.633 --> 1:14:12.700
I am so sorry for interrupting,
but I was so inspired

1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:13.867
by your and Edna's story,

1:14:14.033 --> 1:14:16.333
and, and two special
people deserve something.

1:14:17.067 --> 1:14:18.733
-Posh.
-Yeah.

1:14:18.900 --> 1:14:22.400
Oh wow, I am sure Edna's
going to be thrilled

1:14:22.500 --> 1:14:23.700
when she sees it.

1:14:24.733 --> 1:14:26.567
You're all staying for
the ceremony, right?

1:14:27.333 --> 1:14:28.167
Oh, that is so-

1:14:28.300 --> 1:14:29.133
Count us in!

1:14:31.300 --> 1:14:32.733
Who does not love love?

1:14:33.300 --> 1:14:34.867
Merci! Woo!

1:14:35.867 --> 1:14:38.333
[bouncy music]

1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:39.233
[Frankie squeals]

1:14:39.467 --> 1:14:40.500
[Harry laughs]

1:14:40.867 --> 1:14:41.700
[Jack] You doing all right?

1:14:42.467 --> 1:14:44.067
[Boner] Man, even my
knees are sweating.

1:14:46.133 --> 1:14:46.967
[Jack] It's okay, man.

1:14:47.167 --> 1:14:48.633
Look, we're keeping
up a good pace.

1:14:49.033 --> 1:14:50.033
That's the most important thing.

1:14:50.867 --> 1:14:51.700
Gotta keep on trucking.

1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:54.733
Man, I just noticed,

1:14:56.233 --> 1:14:57.367
we separated from the pack.

1:14:58.700 --> 1:14:59.700
There's nobody around us, man.

1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:00.667
We're in first place.

1:15:00.733 --> 1:15:01.567
[Jack laughs]

1:15:03.067 --> 1:15:06.033
Actually, we're
running dead last.

1:15:06.733 --> 1:15:08.067
-What?
-[Jack] Yeah.

1:15:08.667 --> 1:15:09.500
[Boner] Man.

1:15:10.567 --> 1:15:12.967
Here it is, finish line,
buddy, let's do this.

1:15:13.033 --> 1:15:13.867
Yeah?

1:15:13.967 --> 1:15:14.800
Oh, that's awesome.

1:15:15.567 --> 1:15:16.400
Oh.

1:15:16.667 --> 1:15:17.500
[Jack] Huh?

1:15:21.033 --> 1:15:22.333
Not really supposed to
be stopping here, bud.

1:15:23.067 --> 1:15:23.900
I couldn't cross the line

1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:25.067
without letting you know
something first.

1:15:25.833 --> 1:15:26.900
What is it bro?

1:15:27.367 --> 1:15:28.467
I slept with Stacy, too.

1:15:30.033 --> 1:15:30.867
What?

1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:34.467
[Boner laughing]

1:15:34.533 --> 1:15:35.633
I'm just messing with you, man.

1:15:36.233 --> 1:15:37.067
What are you-

1:15:37.167 --> 1:15:38.133
Oh, that's gross, I've never.

1:15:38.667 --> 1:15:40.367
Oh, but this is real though,

1:15:42.200 --> 1:15:44.733
I've always admired you for
being healthy and athletic,

1:15:45.700 --> 1:15:48.300
and I never thought I
could be like that

1:15:49.067 --> 1:15:51.167
'cause I've always just
been the big bone, you know?

1:15:52.667 --> 1:15:54.033
I thought that's what
I'd always be,

1:15:55.133 --> 1:15:58.167
but now that I got Angela
and the new baby on the way,

1:15:59.333 --> 1:16:01.300
I found something that makes
me wanna be a better man,

1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.533
and you taught me that I can
make that change a reality.

1:16:07.300 --> 1:16:10.533
Now, you tell me, what
do you have in your life

1:16:11.067 --> 1:16:12.467
that makes you want to
be a better man?

1:16:13.667 --> 1:16:14.833
And you put it in your mind

1:16:15.900 --> 1:16:17.467
and we can cross this
finish line together.
