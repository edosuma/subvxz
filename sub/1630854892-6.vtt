WEBVTT

00:08.509 --> 00:11.512
Am I to assume
that you do not want an office

00:11.512 --> 00:14.765
- in the managerial suite?
- I may be able to help you out,

00:14.765 --> 00:17.476
Iain, just until all of this
blows over.

00:17.476 --> 00:19.937
- Frank Flores?
- How did you hear about me?

00:19.937 --> 00:21.439
Regis Patoff.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.401
You know, you're not at all
like he described you.

00:25.401 --> 00:29.196
Enough about me.
I'm interested in you, Patricia.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.157
Regis Patoff
commissioned you to make

00:31.157 --> 00:33.534
a solid gold skeleton?

00:36.412 --> 00:38.956
Thank you.

00:41.167 --> 00:44.712
Oh, I felt sick on
the way in so I headed back.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.088
I shoulda told you.

00:52.052 --> 00:55.055
Descend upon me.
Purify me, Lord.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.851
Mold me, fill me with Yourself,
use me.

00:58.851 --> 01:02.480
Banish all the forces of evil
from me, destroy them,

01:02.480 --> 01:06.442
defeat them, so that I can be
healthy and do good deeds.

01:06.442 --> 01:08.986
Banish from me all spells,

01:08.986 --> 01:11.655
witchcraft, curses,
and the evil eye.

01:11.655 --> 01:15.117
Diabolic infestations,
oppressions, possessions.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.453
All that is evil and sinful,

01:17.453 --> 01:20.706
jealousy, deceitfulness, envy,

01:20.706 --> 01:23.793
physical, psychological...

01:23.793 --> 01:26.253
Moral, spiritual,
and diabolical ailments

01:26.253 --> 01:28.047
burn all these...

01:29.215 --> 01:31.133
...that they may never again
touch me.

01:31.133 --> 01:34.053
I command and bid all the powers
who molest me,

01:34.053 --> 01:36.931
by the power of God
all powerful...

02:03.249 --> 02:05.501
...In the name of Jesus Christ,
our Savior,

02:05.501 --> 02:07.920
through the intercession of
the Immaculate Virgin Mary,

02:07.920 --> 02:10.214
to leave me forever,
and to be consigned

02:10.214 --> 02:12.675
into the everlasting hell
where they will be bound

02:12.675 --> 02:15.386
by our guardian angels,
and where they will be crushed

02:15.386 --> 02:17.763
under the heel of
the Immaculate Virgin Mary.

02:27.773 --> 02:30.901
What was that?!

02:30.901 --> 02:32.903
Who's there?

02:39.577 --> 02:40.953
Hello?

02:40.953 --> 02:42.246
What the...

02:42.246 --> 02:44.039
Whoa, stay back.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.041
There's, there's glass
everywhere.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.585
Is anything missing?

02:47.585 --> 02:49.545
Is anything fucking valuable?

02:49.545 --> 02:51.589
Hello?

02:51.589 --> 02:53.173
Oh, shit.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.425
Careful.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.738
Wait, what? Babe, you're gonna
be late for work.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.574
Oh, I called Dr. Grant.
I told him I'm sick.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.954
Well, what's wrong with you?

04:04.954 --> 04:07.706
I'm clammy. My throat's sore.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.710
Maybe I caught
your three-day flu.

04:13.379 --> 04:15.381
How long have
you been out again?

04:15.381 --> 04:17.174
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday?

04:17.174 --> 04:20.094
You know, actually, I'm feeling
a lot better today.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.556
Good.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.767
Maybe you could fetch me
some hot tea.

05:14.606 --> 05:18.527
Mr. Patoff, we have the live
analytics from the focus group.

05:18.527 --> 05:19.987
Where's Dana today?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.822
Her son's in the hospital.

05:25.242 --> 05:29.163
We're sticking particularly well
with males under 30.

05:29.163 --> 05:32.124
Numbers, what do they mean?

05:32.124 --> 05:33.792
Number of active users.

05:33.792 --> 05:36.378
Time spent playing.
Time spent away.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.464
They like our game?

05:38.464 --> 05:41.341
The satisfaction report will be
published by end of day.

05:41.341 --> 05:45.220
Tammy and Chi are still
collating.

05:48.432 --> 05:51.143
That's them calling me now.
They probably have an update.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.145
- Answer your phone.
- Oh.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.023
Hi.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.245
- Craig? Oh my God, are you ok?
- Three-day flu.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.289
I'm infectious,
so just fuck off six feet.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.458
- Oh! Shoes.
- What?

06:14.458 --> 06:16.335
New policy.
No exceptions.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.591
Whose idea was that?

06:22.591 --> 06:24.968
No, actually, save yourself
the oxygen.

06:28.514 --> 06:31.141
This is a masterpiece.

06:33.352 --> 06:35.979
Dude. You're alive.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.981
Yeah.
Oh, it's a three-day flu.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.150
Fuck me!
It smells like feet in here.

06:40.150 --> 06:43.487
They've done studies. Working
barefoot boosts creativity.

06:43.487 --> 06:46.573
Trust me, Patoff is not doing
this to increase our work.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.534
He's doing it to assert his
dominance.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.953
He's up there in fucking
ski boots.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.043
Why is no one working?

06:58.043 --> 07:00.963
We are waiting to be told
what to do.

07:00.963 --> 07:03.465
What? Come on, guys.
I've been gone three days.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.801
Why aren't we working on
Upskirt Jungle?

07:05.801 --> 07:07.302
It's done.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.014
What do you mean it's done?

07:11.014 --> 07:13.517
Patoff had us working
16-hour days to get it finished.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.310
He signed off on it
late last night.

07:15.310 --> 07:18.355
We wouldn't have busted a nut
but we thought you had cancer.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.274
What else would you be
remembered for?

07:20.274 --> 07:22.401
You...you finished Upskirt
Jungle without me?

07:23.944 --> 07:26.405
You might wanna take
a look at it.

08:38.227 --> 08:41.980
Oh hi, Craig. You alright?
I hear you were really sick.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.819
What the fuck is going on
around here?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.618
Wow. You actually did it.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.578
You went and stole yourself
an office.

08:56.578 --> 08:57.788
- Sit down, Craig.
- No, no.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.790
I'm not gonna sit down.
You're the assistant.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.209
You're not supposed to have
another chair.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.797
Why didn't you tell me they
renamed my game?

09:06.797 --> 09:09.466
We can't launch with the word
"Upskirt" in the title.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.927
- What? Was it his idea?
- We did a brainstorm.

09:11.927 --> 09:13.845
I don't remember
where the idea originated.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.847
What about "Pain Forest?"
Or "Achy-Breaky Glass"

09:15.847 --> 09:17.849
or a million other titles
we coulda come up with!

09:17.849 --> 09:18.892
Craig, it's too late.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.061
It's already out to the focus
group now.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.939
Already!? Already!
Did you even test it?

09:31.363 --> 09:33.949
I have been watching
the news every day.

09:33.949 --> 09:36.827
There's nothing on a fatal
robbery in Pomona.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.175
"I will attach tendons to you
and make flesh come upon you

09:52.175 --> 09:54.052
"and cover you with skin.

09:54.052 --> 09:57.055
"I will put breath in you.
You will come to life.

09:57.055 --> 10:01.393
"And then you'll know that I am
the Lord." Ezekiel 37.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.603
That's what
you've been doing all week?

10:03.603 --> 10:06.481
Memorizing Bible passages?

10:07.816 --> 10:10.110
Yeah. I downloaded
the audio version.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.988
Now I just wake up
knowing this shit.

10:12.988 --> 10:15.615
I thought that you weren't
coming back.

10:15.615 --> 10:19.161
Yeah, well, turns out I'm not
safe in my own home, either.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.121
Somebody smashed our front glass
last night.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.833
You live in
a bad neighborhood.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.878
And how do you explain those
three guys in masks?

10:27.878 --> 10:30.339
I don't know, maybe it's some
random stick-up guys

10:30.339 --> 10:32.174
who chose the wrong store.

10:33.842 --> 10:37.721
Craig, I know that this
is upsetting...

10:37.721 --> 10:39.765
but he's not trying
to kill you.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.587
Raul, did you change the weight
tolerance on this?

11:10.587 --> 11:12.005
No.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.758
Can you explain to me how
a snake and a monkey team up

11:14.758 --> 11:17.469
to break a three-inch thick
sheet of tempered glass?

11:17.469 --> 11:19.805
Oh, Patoff wanted to make it
more random.

11:19.805 --> 11:23.934
- Random?
- Fun.

11:25.435 --> 11:29.064
Where's the fun in a game
without any strategy?

11:38.782 --> 11:40.242
Will you hurry up?

11:40.242 --> 11:42.160
I lost a fucking shoe!

11:48.750 --> 11:50.419
Fuck him!

12:00.470 --> 12:02.389
What are these,
fucking clown shoes?

12:02.389 --> 12:04.599
Look, they have metal heels
on the bottom.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.601
Who has shoes with metal heels?

12:08.979 --> 12:10.981
- How's Patti?
- She's pissed at me.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.567
-She found out I went to Pomona.
-How?

12:13.567 --> 12:17.863
She must be reading my emails.
She saw my Uber receipt.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.531
Did you tell her
what happened?

12:19.531 --> 12:21.408
No, of course not.
I denied everything.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.369
I told her that my Uber account
got hacked.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.329
Why didn't you just
tell her the truth?

12:26.329 --> 12:28.623
Because it sounds fucking crazy!
And when I proposed to her,

12:28.623 --> 12:30.667
I made her a promise I'd like,
you know, try.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.961
That I'd show up for work,
and I'd become a Catholic,

12:32.961 --> 12:34.629
and I wouldn't get stoned
all the time.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.924
And all this bullshit stuff that
she seems to like.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.843
For Craig!

12:39.843 --> 12:42.971
Hey, can you get that,
or are you too important now?

12:42.971 --> 12:44.890
I want to check in on Patti.

13:14.377 --> 13:17.923
The satisfaction report from
the focus group.

13:17.923 --> 13:21.718
I'm sorry that it's so late.
I had a copy printed for you.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.012
What are they saying?

13:24.012 --> 13:27.140
From "charming and addictive" to
"boring" and "fuck this shit."

13:27.140 --> 13:29.768
That's normal. They all hated
"Escape From Leprechaun Island"

13:29.768 --> 13:31.937
but it continues to be
our top-earner.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.606
Can't please all of the people
all of the time.

13:34.606 --> 13:37.108
No. I have a couple of follow-up
calls I need to do

13:37.108 --> 13:39.611
in the morning before you
approve it to go to marketing.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.404
Tomorrow is Saturday.

13:41.404 --> 13:44.115
I was planning on coming in
for a couple of hours.

13:44.115 --> 13:46.034
Keep things moving forward.

13:48.578 --> 13:51.122
Craig must be feeling better.

13:54.543 --> 13:58.213
I saw him in your office
earlier.

13:58.213 --> 14:02.050
Three-day flu. A lot of people
are going down with it.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.139
Why do you lie for him?

14:16.940 --> 14:19.568
I'm not.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.444
I mean, I-- I don't.

14:26.616 --> 14:29.202
Craig is having
a difficult time at home.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.662
With Patti?

14:32.497 --> 14:34.833
I only conversed with her
briefly,

14:34.833 --> 14:39.713
but I formed an impression that
that wedding may not happen.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.008
What do you think, Elaine?

14:44.968 --> 14:47.971
I think it's something that
they're gonna have to sort out

14:47.971 --> 14:49.806
between themselves.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.977
You're right.

14:53.977 --> 14:57.355
Perhaps they need time apart
to analyze their feelings.

15:00.358 --> 15:04.195
So it's okay if we cut Craig a
little bit of slack right now?

15:04.195 --> 15:07.616
Of course!
That's what friends are for.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.368
Okay.

15:14.789 --> 15:16.958
Elaine.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.877
Yes, Mr. Patoff?

15:22.213 --> 15:23.798
Your computer?

15:43.735 --> 15:45.362
Kept it mild for you.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.197
Ah, thanks, babe.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.951
Hmm.

15:53.745 --> 15:57.248
Bless us, Lord, and this food
we are about to receive

15:57.248 --> 16:00.502
from your bounty.
Thank you for keeping us safe,

16:00.502 --> 16:03.380
and united, and strong.
Amen.

16:06.383 --> 16:07.801
Amen.

16:10.220 --> 16:13.640
What's the deal with
exorcisms? Are they for real?

16:13.640 --> 16:17.310
Or it's just something
they made up for TV?

16:17.310 --> 16:20.897
The Church will sometimes
intervene in cases

16:20.897 --> 16:23.191
of demonic possession.

16:23.191 --> 16:26.027
Whether they're real
or imagined.

16:26.027 --> 16:28.405
Have you ever
done one?

16:28.405 --> 16:31.199
- Me personally?
- Yeah.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.702
I've never been
called upon.

16:33.702 --> 16:37.706
Between the two
of us, Craig,

16:37.706 --> 16:41.459
I'm a little disappointed
about that.

16:41.459 --> 16:43.753
Do you feel like you've been
under some kind of...

16:43.753 --> 16:45.672
No, no, no. No, not me.

16:45.672 --> 16:49.759
It's just this guy at work.

16:49.759 --> 16:54.139
I don't know what's going on
inside of him, and...

16:54.139 --> 16:57.976
I'm starting to have some really
crazy thoughts in my head.

16:59.811 --> 17:04.232
Sometimes we create
an adversary

17:04.232 --> 17:06.443
to justify
our own failings.

17:06.443 --> 17:10.447
Hmm. Wow. This Catholic thing
is pretty brutal, huh?

17:12.198 --> 17:14.659
Why are you
really here, Craig?

17:17.245 --> 17:19.706
Well, at first,

17:19.706 --> 17:22.876
it was so that I could
marry Patti.

17:22.876 --> 17:26.421
Now... Right now,

17:26.421 --> 17:31.050
I think I'm just here to
stay the fuck alive.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.763
Who's your enemy?

17:36.765 --> 17:38.892
He's Shao Kahn.

17:38.892 --> 17:41.060
He's Donkey Kong.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.729
Sometimes he's fucking Bowser.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.647
Sorry, I know those are nerdy
references.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.913
He's the boss.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.873
That's all he is.

18:03.458 --> 18:07.587
And I shouldn't be
taking him home.

18:07.587 --> 18:12.008
But he just lets himself in,
whenever he wants to.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.845
What are you gonna do?

18:19.224 --> 18:21.226
You know? He's the man.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.162
Oh, thank fuck.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.272
Hello, young man.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.236
May I?

20:02.660 --> 20:04.829
I'd like to play a game
with you.

20:11.127 --> 20:14.213
I'm not allowed phones.

20:17.884 --> 20:21.220
It's called "Mr. Sang's
Jungle Odyssey."

20:23.222 --> 20:25.516
No one will be
angry with you.

20:51.376 --> 20:54.128
In your own words,

20:54.128 --> 20:57.423
I'd like you to tell me
how the game makes you feel.

21:45.555 --> 21:50.101
Hi, it's Elaine from CompWare.
It's Tan, right?

21:50.101 --> 21:51.769
Tang. Like, taste.

21:51.769 --> 21:55.148
Oh, sorry. I know that
it's Saturday morning

21:55.148 --> 21:57.859
so I won't take up too much of
your time.

21:57.859 --> 22:01.237
Uh, so I'm calling today because
we detected an unusual pattern

22:01.237 --> 22:03.281
in your gameplay.

22:03.281 --> 22:05.950
It says that you played
"Mr. Sang's Jungle Odyssey"

22:05.950 --> 22:08.745
nine times, for seven hours
and 11 minutes.

22:08.745 --> 22:11.706
And our data says that you
stopped at level 316.

22:11.706 --> 22:15.209
Yeah. Seven hours and 11 minutes
I will never get back.

22:15.209 --> 22:18.212
So, you were disappointed
with level 316.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.298
Look, I'm running for
the golden egg,

22:20.298 --> 22:24.969
the elephant drops, I die.
Every fucking time.

22:24.969 --> 22:28.264
I got so angry I smashed my face
into the patio window.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.099
One star from Tang.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.621
I've completed every single game
I've ever played until now.

22:51.621 --> 22:54.415
So, you stopped at level 316?

22:54.415 --> 22:56.626
I didn't stop!
It glitched!

23:00.046 --> 23:03.132
Kyle, what happened
to your hand?

23:03.132 --> 23:04.967
I punched the window.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.807
Because of the game?

23:10.807 --> 23:12.642
Because of that fucking
elephant!

24:14.537 --> 24:16.164
Fucking assholes.

24:20.877 --> 24:22.128
Dana, why are you here?

24:22.128 --> 24:23.254
He wanted shortbread.

24:23.254 --> 24:27.091
Said it had to be homemade.

24:27.091 --> 24:31.304
I already ate three
on the drive in-- stop me.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.973
How's your son? Terry?

24:33.973 --> 24:35.892
- Timmy.
- Oh, sorry.

24:35.892 --> 24:39.437
Uh, yeah, he's stitched up,
he's gonna be fine.

24:39.437 --> 24:42.106
It's a miracle he didn't hit
an artery.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.193
What happened?

24:46.861 --> 24:50.198
He had a temper tantrum,
and we couldn't calm him down.

24:50.198 --> 24:54.410
He shoved his hand
through the bathroom window.

24:54.410 --> 24:57.955
I don't know if he couldn't see
the window wasn't open or what.

24:57.955 --> 25:00.625
Timmy's not as dexterous
as Darius was.

25:00.625 --> 25:03.586
Dana, does Timmy play games
on your phone?

25:03.586 --> 25:07.215
It's the only thing
that keeps him from kicking us.

25:13.387 --> 25:15.223
You're not shortbread.

25:22.605 --> 25:26.943
I went heavy on the fat-to-flour
ratio, Mr. Patoff.

25:26.943 --> 25:31.572
You might wanna watch your heart
if you're gonna eat 'em all.

25:33.241 --> 25:35.243
Was there anything else
this weekend?

25:35.243 --> 25:37.286
You're not needed
any longer.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.708
Mr. Patoff.
We have a problem.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.919
I've been following up
with the focus group,

25:44.919 --> 25:47.880
and nobody can get past
level 316.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.133
- It's a difficult game.
- I think that there's a glitch,

25:51.133 --> 25:53.970
and we need more time
to test it.

25:53.970 --> 25:57.515
They will just have to
keep on trying.

25:57.515 --> 26:01.018
Forever, if necessary.

26:01.018 --> 26:03.521
They're getting frustrated!
Angry.

26:03.521 --> 26:07.233
In some cases, it's driven
our users to self-harm.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.985
That's what happened
to Dana's son.

26:08.985 --> 26:12.321
Dana downloaded the game on her
phone, her son played the game,

26:12.321 --> 26:14.323
he ended up in the hospital.

26:14.323 --> 26:17.243
This is impossible.

26:17.243 --> 26:22.206
You complete a maze,
you earn a reward, you progress.

26:22.206 --> 26:25.960
An innocent, childish game.
Where's the harm in that?

26:25.960 --> 26:30.631
- We need to delay the launch.
- If we do not launch now,

26:30.631 --> 26:34.343
Mr. Sang and CompWare will
cease to exist.

26:34.343 --> 26:38.556
I analyzed the user feedback and
they lean substantially

26:38.556 --> 26:40.266
towards the positive.

26:42.893 --> 26:46.355
Inform Marketing that we are
ready to launch.

26:55.906 --> 26:58.200
"Mr. Sang's Jungle Odyssey

26:58.200 --> 27:01.203
"is the best game
I've ever played."

27:01.203 --> 27:04.206
Brionny from Ohio's words,
not mine.

27:19.597 --> 27:22.016
Fuck! Fuck this fucking game!

27:26.187 --> 27:28.939
- Are you going out?
- I need to run some errands.

27:28.939 --> 27:32.818
What? I thought-- I thought you
were feeling sick?

27:34.403 --> 27:36.989
- Are you upset?
- I need some air.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.700
- I need to get out.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.410
Babe, babe.

27:41.410 --> 27:43.245
Did I do something?

27:44.747 --> 27:46.749
I don't know, Craig.
Did you?

27:50.169 --> 27:51.754
Patti.

28:05.351 --> 28:09.897
There's not enough natural light
in here for them to survive.

28:09.897 --> 28:12.066
At the weekends
I always collect the plants

28:12.066 --> 28:14.443
and put them in the art
department's window.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.405
Harriet has the sunniest spot
of them all.

28:22.576 --> 28:24.036
Thank you.

28:25.329 --> 28:28.833
We can only grow
in the light, Elaine.
