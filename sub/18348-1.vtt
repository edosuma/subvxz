00:55.961 --> 00:58.395
I am just a poor boy

00:58.464 --> 01:00.467
Though my story's seldom told

01:00.567 --> 01:03.433
I have squandered my resistance

01:03.502 --> 01:05.868
For a pocketful of mumbles

01:05.938 --> 01:08.702
Such are promises

01:08.774 --> 01:11.833
All lies and jest

01:11.911 --> 01:15.311
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear

01:17.615 --> 01:19.551
Just a come-on from those gals
Just a come-on from the whores

01:19.651 --> 01:22.712
On Seventh Avenue Whoo-whoo.

01:22.787 --> 01:24.522
L...
I do declare

01:24.622 --> 01:27.742
There were times when I was so lonesome

01:27.825 --> 01:30.623
That I took some comfort there

01:30.695 --> 01:33.596
La-la-la, la-la-la-la

02:19.875 --> 02:21.875
Bonnie?

02:21.877 --> 02:23.877
Who is it?

02:26.315 --> 02:28.749
Donovan?

02:30.554 --> 02:33.317
Bonnie?
Yes?

02:35.057 --> 02:37.321
Donovan?

02:46.369 --> 02:48.369
In here.

02:55.910 --> 02:59.607
Yes? Donovan Is everything all right?

02:59.682 --> 03:02.151
Yeah The production meeting
was put off, so I thought... Who's here?

03:02.251 --> 03:04.251
Here?
Mm

03:04.252 --> 03:06.621
Who owns that piece-of-shit van
down there?

03:06.721 --> 03:08.721
Oh...

03:08.723 --> 03:13.194
It's just a guy, you know, going
door-to-door selling pool cleaner

03:13.294 --> 03:15.930
So why did he lock himself in the den?

03:16.030 --> 03:18.030
Well, he...

03:18.032 --> 03:20.032
Oh, God...

03:20.034 --> 03:22.269
Remember my friend Ollie?
- Ollie Olerud?

03:22.369 --> 03:25.668
Short, cretinous wanker?

03:25.739 --> 03:28.139
Ohh Ollie's in there?

03:28.208 --> 03:31.439
Yes
- I see

03:33.047 --> 03:35.950
Well, I'm glad he finally got himself a job

03:36.050 --> 03:39.653
I'd always picked him as some sort of
deadbeat, but happy to be proved wrong

03:39.753 --> 03:42.723
So, he's selling pool cleaner now, huh?

03:42.823 --> 03:46.826
Well, this is the neighborhood for that Just
door-to-door...'Running low on chlorine?'

03:46.926 --> 03:49.797
It's quite a coincidence,
him just dropping by...

03:49.897 --> 03:51.799
...and you two knowing each other so well

03:51.899 --> 03:54.634
Donovan, please, let's just
all talk... How you doin'?

03:54.734 --> 03:58.067
Donovan? How you doin', man?

03:58.137 --> 04:01.038
Good day, Ollie I'm great You?

04:01.107 --> 04:04.009
I can't complain, man

04:04.077 --> 04:06.077
Excellent

04:06.078 --> 04:08.982
Well, let's get right
down to it then, shall we?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.332
We'll take a couple vacuum
hoses We probably...

04:11.432 --> 04:13.486
...need a new filter
right about now, maybe...

04:13.586 --> 04:16.822
Wait a minute, darling Do we
actually have a swimming pool?

04:16.923 --> 04:20.793
Okay, okay, man Now, let's be
reasonable about this, okay?

04:20.892 --> 04:22.829
So, you caught me porkin'...

04:22.929 --> 04:24.831
...havin'relations with your old lady

04:24.931 --> 04:26.931
Oh, God...

04:26.933 --> 04:30.535
...and now we're all feelin' just a little bit
embarrassed by the whole thing, so, uh...

04:30.635 --> 04:32.635
What the hey, man

04:32.637 --> 04:36.074
I mean, I know it's a drag and all,
but these things...

04:36.174 --> 04:37.843
Hey. Hey, hey

04:37.943 --> 04:41.463
Uh, w-we... we...

04:41.513 --> 04:46.076
I was depressed 'cause
I'm impotent You know?

04:46.152 --> 04:48.712
Unable to achieve an erection

04:48.787 --> 04:51.391
I have been for over a year now, man,

04:51.491 --> 04:53.725
and I needed someone to talk to

04:53.825 --> 04:56.695
I mean, think about it, man
Ayear without an erection?

04:56.795 --> 04:59.558
Leave him alone.

05:00.898 --> 05:05.204
You should've seen this coming,
you Australian piece of shit.

05:05.304 --> 05:06.304
You bitch.

05:06.404 --> 05:09.874
That's my Daytime Television
Lifetime Achievement Award.

Bye-bye, baby.

05:59.022 --> 06:01.402
Oh, what are you looking at?

06:06.762 --> 06:08.972
Explain this away, darling

06:23.377 --> 06:25.539
We're caught in a trap

06:27.616 --> 06:29.880
I can't walk out

06:31.853 --> 06:37.257
Because I love you too much, baby

06:40.629 --> 06:42.629
Why can't you see

06:44.298 --> 06:46.698
What you're doin'to me

06:48.569 --> 06:50.569
When you don't believe

06:50.571 --> 06:53.768
A word I say

06:57.677 --> 07:01.307
We can't go on together

07:01.382 --> 07:03.975
With suspicious minds

07:04.050 --> 07:05.585
Suspicious minds

07:05.685 --> 07:09.679
And we can't build our dreams

07:09.757 --> 07:13.659
On suspicious minds

07:13.728 --> 07:16.219
So if an old friend I know

07:17.964 --> 07:20.432
Drops by to say hello

07:22.434 --> 07:25.199
Would I still see suspicion

07:25.272 --> 07:28.435
In your eyes

07:30.343 --> 07:32.868
But here we go again

07:34.980 --> 07:37.175
Askin'where I been

07:39.652 --> 07:41.855
You can't see the tears are real

07:41.955 --> 07:43.689
I'm cryin'

07:43.789 --> 07:47.419
Yes, I'm cryin'

07:47.494 --> 07:51.623
We can't go on together

07:51.697 --> 07:54.188
With suspicious minds

07:54.266 --> 07:55.769
Suspicious minds

07:55.869 --> 08:00.066
And we can't build our dreams

08:00.139 --> 08:03.939
On suspicious minds

08:05.977 --> 08:09.539
Oh, let our love survive

08:10.682 --> 08:14.243
I'll dry the tears from your eyes

08:15.887 --> 08:19.482
Let's don't let a good thing die

08:20.825 --> 08:22.493
When, honey, you know

08:22.593 --> 08:24.593
I have never

08:24.662 --> 08:26.789
Lied to you

08:26.864 --> 08:28.923
Mm-mmm

08:30.436 --> 08:33.768
Yeah, yeah

08:33.837 --> 08:36.703
We're caught in a trap

08:38.743 --> 08:40.972
I can't walk out

08:42.145 --> 08:44.876
Oooh Because I love you

08:44.948 --> 08:48.145
Too much, baby

08:49.286 --> 08:52.190
Miles Massey's office
Hey, it's me Any messages?

08:52.290 --> 08:54.257
Yeah, quite a few Where
are you? Just whitening

08:54.357 --> 08:57.427
Jim says he wants a meeting today,
if possible Mm-hmm What else?

08:57.527 --> 08:59.931
Chapman says his wife is now in Tahoe

09:00.031 --> 09:01.865
Tell Amstedler I'll return in 20 minutes,

09:01.965 --> 09:05.168
get Wrigley to look up Oliphant v
Oliphant, Commonwealth of Virginia...

09:05.268 --> 09:07.804
...for its relevance in the Chapman filing...

09:07.904 --> 09:09.616
Oliphant v Oliphant,
relevance to Chapman...

09:09.716 --> 09:11.108
She said she took the kids to Tahoe?

09:11.208 --> 09:13.110
That's right Wait, which side ofTahoe?

09:13.210 --> 09:15.110
She's on some kind of cruise

09:15.210 --> 09:16.895
Yeah, well, if the cruise
goes all the way around...

09:16.995 --> 09:18.614
...the lake, she's left the
state and she's in breach

09:18.714 --> 09:21.116
Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing
to attach A filing to attach

09:21.216 --> 09:23.120
What do you want in it?
Everything

09:23.220 --> 09:26.122
Primary residence, beach house, ski
cabin, auto, stocks, bonds, dental floss

09:26.222 --> 09:28.391
Everything Uh-huh Gonna lose ya

09:28.491 --> 09:30.491
Uh-huh

09:30.492 --> 09:32.169
And tell Fred Armatrading that we finally...

09:32.269 --> 09:34.063
...have pictures of his
wife with the oral surgeon

09:34.163 --> 09:36.693
Oh, and get a fruit and pastry
basket in the conference...

09:36.793 --> 09:38.833
...room for my 9:30 Didn't
have time for breakfast

09:38.933 --> 09:41.143
Where are you?
Comin' at ya

09:42.538 --> 09:44.740
Your 9:00 is here Bonnie Donaly

09:44.840 --> 09:47.502
Bonnie Donaly

09:54.215 --> 09:56.215
Mrs Donaly

09:57.752 --> 10:00.220
Hmm

10:03.191 --> 10:05.624
Mm-hmm

10:05.694 --> 10:08.128
Hmm

10:08.196 --> 10:12.000
Yes, your husband did show remarkable
foresight in taking those pictures,

10:12.100 --> 10:15.500
and, yes,
absent a swimming pool,

10:15.570 --> 10:18.473
the presence of a pool man
would appear to be suspicious

10:18.573 --> 10:21.742
But, madam,
who is the real victim here?

10:21.842 --> 10:23.744
Let me suggest to you the following

10:23.844 --> 10:26.747
Your husband, on a prior occasion,
had slapped you... beat you

10:26.847 --> 10:29.515
I think that word is not inappropriate No, I...

10:29.615 --> 10:31.615
Let me finish, please

10:31.618 --> 10:34.021
I'm not concerned
with who slapped whom first

10:34.121 --> 10:36.523
Your husband, who had beaten
you repeatedly... No, he never...

10:36.623 --> 10:39.626
Please... repeatedly, was at the time
brandishing your firearm...

10:39.726 --> 10:42.630
It was his gun
- And we'll get it back for you

10:42.730 --> 10:45.566
Trying, in his rage,
to shoot an acquaintance,

10:45.666 --> 10:47.666
a friend of long standing

10:47.668 --> 10:50.036
They never really cared for each other

10:50.136 --> 10:52.039
And if not for your
cool-headed intervention,

10:52.139 --> 10:55.041
his tantrum might have ended
this schmo's life and ruined his own

10:55.141 --> 10:59.545
As for the sexual indiscretion
which he imagined took place,

10:59.645 --> 11:04.320
wasn't it in fact he
who was sleeping with the pool man?

11:05.918 --> 11:08.977
No?
Am I going too far here?

11:09.055 --> 11:10.957
Were his sexual... No I don't...

11:11.057 --> 11:13.057
Sorry I'm not omniscient

11:13.059 --> 11:16.128
The point is that he acted upon an
assumption which he cannot prove,

11:16.228 --> 11:18.493
and I take it you deny...

11:18.564 --> 11:20.967
Well...
- Fine I'll take the case

11:21.067 --> 11:24.336
It's imperative that I meet with Oliver
Olerud before we proceed any further...

11:24.436 --> 11:28.506
...so that I can massage the kinks
out of our testimony

11:28.606 --> 11:30.742
Do you really think
we can put all this across?

11:30.842 --> 11:34.012
The truth is so self-evident
to me, Mrs Donaly,

11:34.112 --> 11:38.416
that I'm sure I'll be able to make it
equally as transparent to anyjury,

11:38.516 --> 11:40.419
should your husband
decide to take it that far

11:40.519 --> 11:44.189
We'll need to caucus again to draw up
a picture of your husband's net worth

11:44.289 --> 11:46.692
A map of enemy territory,
so to speak

11:46.792 --> 11:49.694
You said he's a television producer?
He has a soap opera... The Sands of Time

11:49.794 --> 11:51.794
It's a silly show

11:51.796 --> 11:53.796
Well, it'll be yours soon

11:53.798 --> 11:55.798
Thank you very much

11:55.800 --> 11:58.605
Thank you, Mr Massey Yeah Bye-bye

12:00.971 --> 12:04.476
Still, you have to admire him
for taking those pictures

12:04.576 --> 12:06.576
Now, Mrs Gutman,

12:06.577 --> 12:10.481
you testified that you were
your husband's sexual slave...

12:10.581 --> 12:13.484
...for 36 years during your marriage

12:13.584 --> 12:17.654
Except for two years when he
was in the navy in Southeast Asia

12:17.754 --> 12:20.657
And before your marriage,
what was your profession?

12:20.757 --> 12:23.393
I was a hostess for Braniff Airlines

12:23.493 --> 12:26.162
And what is your husband's profession?

12:26.262 --> 12:29.532
He manufactures staples
and industrial brad tacks

12:29.632 --> 12:31.632
He's very successful

12:31.634 --> 12:36.194
How would you describe
your husband's sexual proclivities?

12:36.239 --> 12:40.699
Well, at first he was
a very gentle and tender lover

12:40.776 --> 12:43.679
But then he became more
and more fixated...

12:43.779 --> 12:46.682
...on toys and machinery
and devices of various kinds

12:46.782 --> 12:49.685
I can't help it
You don't decide to become bored

12:49.785 --> 12:52.188
It just happens
You're just looking for trouble

12:52.288 --> 12:54.288
It's a midlife crisis

12:54.289 --> 12:56.883
Look, get yourself a new car

12:56.958 --> 12:58.958
I have a new car

12:58.961 --> 13:02.397
I have two new cars and a tab
at the Mercedes dealership

13:02.497 --> 13:04.332
Torn the house down twice,

13:04.432 --> 13:06.268
rebuilt the cabin in Vail,

13:06.368 --> 13:09.328
got three of those, uh yard people...

13:09.371 --> 13:12.374
Gardeners? Gardeners I've
got a man who waxes my jet

13:12.474 --> 13:14.675
These encounters were videotaped

13:14.775 --> 13:17.044
Sometimes there would be a gizmo

13:17.144 --> 13:19.144
A gizmo?

13:19.147 --> 13:22.049
He had a device he called the Intruder

13:22.149 --> 13:24.952
It was something he had
the engineers at the factory design

13:25.052 --> 13:29.124
And then he had a prototype built
out of the parts from our vacuum cleaner

13:29.224 --> 13:31.025
I see

13:31.125 --> 13:34.028
So the vacuum cleaner wasn't
available to me for several months

13:34.128 --> 13:36.765
Several months without the appliance Yes.

13:36.865 --> 13:39.767
The problem is, everyone
is willing to compromise

13:39.867 --> 13:43.271
That's the problem with the institution
of marriage It's based on compromise

13:43.371 --> 13:45.272
Even through its dissolution

13:45.372 --> 13:48.276
Mrs Gutman here,
she's gonna score some points...

13:48.376 --> 13:50.277
...concerning her husband's sexual politics

13:50.377 --> 13:52.279
Naturally,
we'll try to impeach

13:52.379 --> 13:55.282
And then the entire process
will find an equilibrium point...

13:55.382 --> 13:57.785
...based on the skill of
the individual lawyers

13:57.885 --> 14:01.988
Then both parties will go home with
their portion of the staple factory

14:02.088 --> 14:03.990
That's life Life is compromise

14:04.090 --> 14:06.470
That's not life That's death

14:08.061 --> 14:12.065
Struggle and challenge and ultimate
destruction of your opponent... that's life

14:12.165 --> 14:14.165
Let me ask you something

14:14.167 --> 14:16.167
Attila the Hun

14:16.169 --> 14:19.072

Well, he's the tennis pro at the club

14:50.302 --> 14:52.668
The tennis pro?

14:54.973 --> 14:58.578
Then why are your
letters addressed to him,

14:58.678 --> 15:00.803
'Dear David and Goliath'?

15:02.014 --> 15:05.005

Yep, I nailed his ass

17:18.713 --> 17:20.579
I thought he'd outgrown trains

17:20.680 --> 17:23.250
They never grow up, lady
They just get tubby

17:23.349 --> 17:26.146
How charming An aphorist

17:26.219 --> 17:28.588
Oh, yeah, I've always
had ample proportions

17:28.688 --> 17:31.591
But believe you me, it's all muscle
I'm as hard as a rock

17:31.691 --> 17:34.827
I'm not one of these cream puff,
sit-behind-the-desk private dicks

17:34.927 --> 17:36.830
I'm an ass-nailer So I see

17:36.930 --> 17:39.832
Gym four times a week...
hour and a half, plus stretching,

17:39.932 --> 17:42.169
LifeCycle, LifeStep, LifeCircuit

17:42.269 --> 17:44.171
Gus Petch don't pussyfoot around

17:44.271 --> 17:46.861
I must say, for someone
in your line of work,

17:46.961 --> 17:49.141
you don't exhibit a great deal of tact

17:49.241 --> 17:52.344
You want tact, call a tactician You
want an ass nailed, you call Gus Petch

17:52.444 --> 17:55.347
Christ, you seem to be taking it pretty good

17:55.447 --> 17:59.185
I seen 'em come in here, weep and
wail like Baptists at a funeral

17:59.285 --> 18:02.687
Like they hired me to prove
their husbands weren't foolin' around

18:02.787 --> 18:05.507
Don't get me wrong, Mr, um...
Petch

18:05.558 --> 18:07.558
Gus Petch

18:07.560 --> 18:12.631
Whilst I don't find this terribly amusing,
I am delighted that you found this material

18:12.731 --> 18:16.301
This is going to be my passport to wealth,

18:16.368 --> 18:19.394
independence and freedom

18:21.473 --> 18:24.788
Sounds like to me you gon' nail his ass

18:31.348 --> 18:34.284
Honey? Honey.

18:34.352 --> 18:37.582
Rex, get away from the door

18:37.655 --> 18:39.655
Honey?

18:39.657 --> 18:41.657
My key doesn't work

18:41.659 --> 18:43.659
Can we talk about this?

18:43.661 --> 18:45.562
Rex, get away from the door

18:45.662 --> 18:48.065
Oh, look, I know that you're upset, honey

18:48.165 --> 18:51.569
Rex, for your own safety,
get away from the door

18:51.669 --> 18:54.071
I don't like having to set the dogs on you

18:54.171 --> 18:57.911
Oh, for crying out loud,
if we could... Dogs?

19:11.722 --> 19:14.054
Yes, dogs

19:14.124 --> 19:17.360
I wanted some security
since I'll be living here alone

19:17.460 --> 19:22.098
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized
discussion about this? Our lawyers can

19:22.198 --> 19:23.899
Aaah.

19:23.999 --> 19:26.535
You have a discovery hearing at 5:30
for the Maxine Gopnick case

19:26.635 --> 19:28.537
Discovery? Gopnick?
And a Lance Kelso called

19:28.637 --> 19:30.541
He read your article about
palimony settlements Lance Kelso...

19:30.641 --> 19:32.375
...in same-sex partnerships...

19:32.475 --> 19:34.377
...and would like to schedule
an appointment Same-sex

19:34.477 --> 19:37.380
Arthur Yardumian and his tax attorney want
to reschedule their caucus for tomorrow

19:37.480 --> 19:40.383
Yardumian? Arthur had to fly to
Atlanta for a deadbeat dad hearing

19:40.483 --> 19:44.308
Atlanta? And your 10:30
is here Rex Rexroth...

19:44.754 --> 19:47.745
Rex Rexroth?

Miles Massey Please sit Relax

19:57.767 --> 20:00.225
Consider this office your office, your haven,

20:00.325 --> 20:02.838
your war room for the
duration of the campaign

20:02.938 --> 20:04.805
Thank you

20:04.905 --> 20:06.905
Now, sir...

20:06.908 --> 20:08.908
...tell me your troubles

20:08.909 --> 20:10.745
Well...

20:10.845 --> 20:13.748
...my wife has me
between a rock and a hard place

20:13.848 --> 20:15.983
That's her job You should respect that

20:16.083 --> 20:19.921
When I first met Marylin,
we were crazy about each other

20:20.021 --> 20:22.923
Not emotionally, of course Just, we
couldn't keep our hands off each other

20:23.023 --> 20:26.118
But then...
then...

20:27.561 --> 20:29.561
Time marches on...

20:29.562 --> 20:32.122
Ardor cools
- Yeah

20:32.199 --> 20:36.033
So, um, we had an understanding

20:36.103 --> 20:39.071
Whereby?
We could see other people

20:39.139 --> 20:43.678
Has Mrs Rexroth pursued the opportunities
implicit in your arrangement?

20:43.778 --> 20:46.046
Uh, I can... I can only assume...

20:46.146 --> 20:48.226
Not in court, you can't...

20:48.248 --> 20:51.250
Has she retained counsel?
- I don't know...

20:51.350 --> 20:54.230
She has rottweilers
- Not a good sign

20:54.288 --> 20:58.963
And have you yourself exploited
your understood freedom?

20:59.992 --> 21:01.828
There's a lady

21:01.928 --> 21:03.928
A- Ayoung lady

21:03.930 --> 21:06.032
She lets me be myself Of course

21:06.132 --> 21:10.363
And your wife is aware
and/or has evidence?

21:10.436 --> 21:13.371
Video
- Hah.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.075
To cut to the chase,
forensically speaking,

21:16.175 --> 21:18.175
is there a prenup?

21:23.649 --> 21:28.053
'The fault, dear Brutus, lies not
in our stars, but in ourselves'

21:28.153 --> 21:31.823
Let me ask you this...
What kind of a settlement do you seek?

21:31.923 --> 21:35.127
What are, for you,
the parameters of the possible?

21:35.227 --> 21:37.227
Well, that's the problem

21:37.229 --> 21:40.204
I can't afford to give her anything

21:43.102 --> 21:45.102
Nothing?

21:45.103 --> 21:48.006
Yeah, I know that sounds
a little rough, but listen,

21:48.106 --> 21:51.009
I'm about to close a deal
to develop some mini-malls

21:51.109 --> 21:53.011
I'm mortgaged up to my heinie

21:53.111 --> 21:55.614
If this deal goes south, I am ruined
I will lose millions

21:55.714 --> 21:58.147
So you propose...

21:58.216 --> 22:01.819
...that, in spite of demonstrable
infidelity on your part,

22:01.919 --> 22:05.389
your unoffending wife should be
tossed out on her ear?

22:05.489 --> 22:09.220
Well, is that possible?

22:14.431 --> 22:16.431
It's a challenge

22:16.500 --> 22:19.403
Why don't you come out to Malibu
and see my new beach house tomorrow

22:19.503 --> 22:21.905
I didn't know Dmitri had a beach house

22:22.005 --> 22:24.909
Neither did I until my lawyer
found it Quite a paper trail

22:25.009 --> 22:26.943
He had it in the dog's name Oh

22:27.043 --> 22:29.479
Well, tomorrow won't work

22:54.170 --> 22:58.441
I've been trying to nail George's
ass for years, but he is so careful

22:58.541 --> 23:02.272
Oh. Oh.

23:02.344 --> 23:04.080
Are you all right, Claire?

23:04.180 --> 23:06.341
Down the wrong pipe...

23:06.415 --> 23:09.375
So, who's your lawyer?

23:12.922 --> 23:15.324
So, who's Rex's guy?
Miles Massey

23:15.424 --> 23:18.483
Miles Massey?
Of Massey, Myerson?

23:18.560 --> 23:20.462
Do you know him?
By reputation

23:20.562 --> 23:23.224
And, Marylin, he's no schnauzer

23:23.298 --> 23:26.201
He got Phyllis Rumsey that
cute little island of George's

23:26.301 --> 23:29.204
George was so impressed, he hired
him when he divorced his second...

23:29.304 --> 23:31.830
Muriel Rumsey
- Who's she?

23:31.907 --> 23:34.875
Now?
Night manager at McDonald's

23:34.943 --> 23:39.003
But, Marylin,
do we have a man for you

23:39.080 --> 23:41.080
Thorstenson Gieselensen

23:41.082 --> 23:43.618
He just separated from his third He's in fish

23:43.718 --> 23:45.620
He is fish Well, he's tuna

23:45.720 --> 23:49.056
Ladies, I'm not seeing anyone
until I've finished nailing Rex's ass

23:49.156 --> 23:51.716
But, Marylin,
this man is tuna

23:51.792 --> 23:55.194
Sarah, one husband at a time

23:56.731 --> 23:58.731
I'll do the talking

23:58.733 --> 24:01.451
I know you'll be tempted to
chime in, but remember...

24:01.551 --> 24:03.904
...that you're in an
emotionally vulnerable state

24:04.004 --> 24:06.268
I'm the professional Oh

24:06.340 --> 24:07.674
Okay

24:07.774 --> 24:10.607
Freddy

24:11.612 --> 24:14.775
Freddy Bender,
this is Rex Rexroth

24:14.848 --> 24:16.750
And you are the lovely Marylin

24:16.850 --> 24:18.850
Please, Ms Rexroth

24:18.852 --> 24:20.854
And you must be Mr Massey

24:20.954 --> 24:22.954
Please, Miles Sit

24:22.956 --> 24:25.550
Sit down

24:25.626 --> 24:29.296
Freddy, I was sorry to hear
about the Goldberger award

24:29.396 --> 24:32.058
Pastry?

24:32.132 --> 24:36.124
We did very well

24:36.202 --> 24:39.104
Not to worry, Mrs Rexroth
You're ably represented

24:39.204 --> 24:42.175
I'm sure Freddy's just too modest to tell
you he used to clerk for Clarence Thomas

24:42.275 --> 24:44.275
Pastry?
Going begging

24:44.276 --> 24:46.767
Don't try to bait me, Miles

24:46.845 --> 24:49.248
If you have a proposal to make,
let's hear it

24:49.348 --> 24:54.786
Well, at this point my client is still
prepared to consider reconciliation

24:54.886 --> 24:56.789
My client's ruled that out

24:56.889 --> 24:58.908
My client is prepared to
entertain an amicable...

24:59.008 --> 25:00.859
...dissolution to the
marriage without prejudice

25:00.959 --> 25:02.861
That's a fart in a stiff wind

25:02.961 --> 25:04.862
My client proposes
a 30-day cooling-off period

25:04.962 --> 25:07.733
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate

25:07.833 --> 25:11.222
My client asks that you
not initiate proceedings...

25:11.322 --> 25:14.239
...pending his setting certain affairs in order

25:14.339 --> 25:16.339
What's so goddamn funny?

25:16.340 --> 25:18.242
Please, let me handle this

25:18.342 --> 25:22.380
All right, so much for the
ice-breakers What are you after, Freddy?

25:22.480 --> 25:27.285
My client is prepared to settle
for 50 percent of the marital assets

25:27.385 --> 25:30.785
Why only 50, Freddy?
Why not a hundred?

25:30.854 --> 25:33.659
While we're dreaming,
why not 150?

25:33.691 --> 25:35.625
Are you familiar with Kershner?
- Kershner does not apply

25:35.725 --> 25:37.628
Bring this to trial,
we'll see if Kershner applies

25:37.728 --> 25:39.463
What's Kershner?
Please, let me handle this...

25:39.563 --> 25:41.932
Kershner was in Kentucky
- Kershner was in Kentucky?

25:42.032 --> 25:43.063
Kershner was in Kentucky

25:43.163 --> 25:45.769
All right, Freddy, forget
Kershner What's your bottom line?

25:45.869 --> 25:47.972
Primary residence,
30 percent of remaining assets

25:48.072 --> 25:52.067
What, are you nuts?
Have you forgotten Kershner?

25:52.175 --> 25:54.769
Freddy, it's a negotiation

25:54.845 --> 25:56.747
See you at the preliminary

25:56.847 --> 25:58.914
Freddy,

26:52.700 --> 26:54.700
Goddamn it

26:54.702 --> 26:58.442
Aah. Aah. Did you see
that? Oh, come on, man.

27:11.985 --> 27:13.985
Here we are

27:15.589 --> 27:19.493
Ms Rexroth, I am so delighted
you decided to come

27:19.593 --> 27:21.495
Well, I must admit I was curious

27:21.595 --> 27:25.326
Something to start?
Some wine, perhaps?

27:26.933 --> 27:28.168
Red?
French?

27:28.268 --> 27:29.603
Bordeaux?
Chateau Margaux?

27:29.703 --> 27:31.703
'57?
'59...

27:31.738 --> 27:33.340
'54

27:33.440 --> 27:36.204
Mmm, Mr Massey Good, sir

27:36.276 --> 27:41.548
Your husband had told me you were the
most beautiful woman that he'd ever met

27:41.648 --> 27:46.048
I didn't expect the most
beautiful woman I'd ever met...

27:46.052 --> 27:49.556
'Dismiss your vows,
your feigned tears, your flattery,

27:49.656 --> 27:53.566
for where a heart is hard
they make no battery'

27:55.061 --> 27:59.292
'Whoever loved
that loved not at first sight?'

27:59.364 --> 28:01.934
Now, you didn't ask me here to pick me up

28:02.034 --> 28:03.936
You could be disbarred for that

28:04.036 --> 28:06.402
Maybe I'm reckless

28:06.472 --> 28:09.308
What was your performance about this
afternoon? What did your lawyer say?

28:09.408 --> 28:11.310
Oh, Freddy thinks you're a buffoon

28:11.410 --> 28:13.946
He says you've been too successful,

28:14.046 --> 28:17.750
you're bored, complacent,
and you're on your way down

28:17.850 --> 28:19.884
But you don't think so How do you know?

28:19.984 --> 28:21.953
Why would you be here?
Why did you ask me?

28:22.053 --> 28:23.488
Can't I be curious?
About what?

28:23.588 --> 28:25.491
Do you ever answer questions? Do you?

28:25.591 --> 28:28.493
I'll have the tournedoes of beef
The lady will have the same Thank you

28:28.593 --> 28:30.428
Thank you, sir

28:30.528 --> 28:32.430
I assume you're a carnivore

28:32.530 --> 28:36.091
Oh, Mr Massey, you have no idea

28:36.167 --> 28:38.658
Miles, please

28:38.737 --> 28:40.639
Tell me more about yourself

28:40.739 --> 28:43.673
All right, Miles

28:43.742 --> 28:46.643
Let me tell you
everything that you need to know

28:46.743 --> 28:50.415
You may think you're tough,
but I eat men like you for breakfast

28:50.515 --> 28:53.317
I've invested five good years
in my marriage to Rex,

28:53.417 --> 28:56.320
and I've nailed his ass fair and square

28:56.420 --> 28:58.989
Now I'm going to have it stuffed, mounted...

28:59.089 --> 29:01.925
...and have my lady friends come over
and throw darts at it

29:02.025 --> 29:04.025
Man-hater, huh?

29:04.962 --> 29:07.631
People don't go on safaris
'cause they hate animals

29:07.731 --> 29:10.634
So it's just for the hunt,
with the trophy at the end

29:10.734 --> 29:13.328
No Nothing so frivolous

29:14.937 --> 29:17.736
This divorce means money

29:17.809 --> 29:19.809
Money means independence

29:19.810 --> 29:22.404
That's what I'm after

29:22.478 --> 29:24.688
What are you after, Miles?

29:24.748 --> 29:26.748
Well, I'm a lot like you

29:26.750 --> 29:29.470
Just looking for an ass to mount

29:31.521 --> 29:33.561
Well, don't look at mine

29:44.934 --> 29:47.494
Yeah

29:50.906 --> 29:53.271
Oy vey

30:14.094 --> 30:17.224

30:33.380 --> 30:37.680
Uh, I'll just have a, um, salad, please

30:37.751 --> 30:39.982
Um, baby field greens

30:40.054 --> 30:42.487
What did you call me?

30:42.556 --> 30:47.016
Uh, no, I-I...
I- I didn't call you anything

30:47.094 --> 30:50.397
You want a salad? Yeah Do you...
Do you have a, uh, green salad?

30:50.497 --> 30:52.800
What the fuck color would it be?

30:52.900 --> 30:54.900
Why are we eating here?

30:54.902 --> 30:56.902
What's his problem?

30:56.904 --> 30:59.597
Just bring him an iceberg
lettuce and a mealy...

30:59.697 --> 31:02.276
...tomato wedge smothered
with French dressing...

31:02.376 --> 31:03.376
And for you?

31:03.476 --> 31:07.046
Ham sandwich on stale rye bread
Lots of mayo, easy on the ham...

31:07.146 --> 31:09.308
Slaw cup?
- What the hell

31:09.383 --> 31:11.284
Hello, Marge How are you, Gus?

31:11.384 --> 31:13.649
I'm all right

31:13.720 --> 31:17.246
Okay, now, I Minoxed her address book

31:17.323 --> 31:20.226
Don't call me anymore
for this penny-ante shit

31:20.326 --> 31:22.829
I shoot action Me and the Ikegami, Jack

31:22.929 --> 31:24.929
Thank you, Gus

31:24.931 --> 31:27.333
And those rottweilers were a menace, man

31:27.433 --> 31:29.433
I told you she had dogs

31:29.434 --> 31:32.137
Yeah You ain't tell me
they had a hard-on for anus Africanus

31:32.237 --> 31:35.264
Gus, did you see any evidence,

31:35.341 --> 31:37.341
any telltale signs...

31:37.342 --> 31:40.345
...of indiscretion on
the part of Mrs Rexroth?

31:40.445 --> 31:43.348
What are you talkin' 'bout,
'telltale signs'?

31:43.448 --> 31:46.382
Look, I see an ass, I nail it

31:46.450 --> 31:48.520
I don't sneak around sniffin' at sheets

31:48.620 --> 31:50.620
Goddamn it,
I'm Gus Petch.

31:50.622 --> 31:53.025
Couldn't you be disbarred for that?

31:53.125 --> 31:56.027
No, I don't think so
Maybe if I'd had the patty melt

31:56.127 --> 31:59.030
You had a guy break into her house
and photograph her address book

31:59.130 --> 32:01.967
No, Wrigley, I happened
to let a man know...

32:02.067 --> 32:04.970
...that I was interested in her
address book... that's not criminal

32:05.070 --> 32:07.972
I also happened to let him know
that I was taking her out to dinner

32:08.072 --> 32:10.072
That's not a crime either

32:10.075 --> 32:12.977
No, I don't see myself
as culpable in any sense

32:13.077 --> 32:15.981
You, on the other hand,
could be disbarred...

32:16.081 --> 32:18.983
...for developing and examining
these photos of her address book,

32:19.083 --> 32:22.018
but that doesn't really concern me

32:22.086 --> 32:24.086
Right

32:24.088 --> 32:26.523
Who are you looking for?
Tenzing Norgay

32:26.623 --> 32:28.623
Tenzing Norgay

32:28.625 --> 32:30.561
That's someone she slept with

32:30.661 --> 32:32.796
I doubt it Tenzing Norgay was the Sherpa...

32:32.896 --> 32:35.031
...that helped Edmund
Hillary climb Mt Everest

32:35.131 --> 32:37.224
And Marylin knows him

32:37.300 --> 32:41.890
No, you idiot Not the Tenzing
Norgay Her Tenzing Norgay

32:42.439 --> 32:44.841
I'm not sure that I actually follow that

32:44.941 --> 32:47.844
Few great accomplishments are
achieved single-handedly, Wrigley

32:47.944 --> 32:49.944
Most have their Norgays

32:49.946 --> 32:53.383
Marylin Rexroth is even now
climbing her Everest

32:53.483 --> 32:55.483
I wanna find her Norgay

32:55.485 --> 32:57.986
But how do you determine
which of the people on here are...

32:58.086 --> 33:00.681
How do you spot a Norgay?
Yeah

33:00.757 --> 33:03.593
You start with the people
with the funny names

33:03.693 --> 33:05.155
Oyez, oyez Family Court of the Fifth

33:05.255 --> 33:07.096
District of Los Angeles
County now in session

33:07.196 --> 33:10.936
The Honorable Marva
Munson presiding All rise

33:16.773 --> 33:19.253
Have you sat before her before?

33:19.274 --> 33:22.477
No No, the judge sits first Then we sit

33:22.577 --> 33:24.479
Well, have you sat after her before?

33:24.579 --> 33:27.716
Sat after her before? You mean,
have we argued before her before?

33:27.816 --> 33:31.219
The judge sits in judgment
The counsel argues before the judge

33:31.319 --> 33:33.588
So, have you argued before her before?

33:33.688 --> 33:36.925
Before her before, or before
she sat before? Before her before

33:37.025 --> 33:39.594
I said, before her before No,
you said before she sat before

33:39.694 --> 33:41.595
I did at first, but...
Look, don't argue

33:41.695 --> 33:43.598
I'm not I'm... No, you don't argue We argue

33:43.698 --> 33:45.099
Counsel argues You appear

33:45.199 --> 33:47.101
Thejudge sits Then you sit...

33:47.201 --> 33:49.103
Or you stand in contempt
- And then we argue

33:49.203 --> 33:51.239
The counsel argues
Which you've done before

33:51.339 --> 33:53.240
Which we've done before Ah

33:53.340 --> 33:55.340
But not before her

33:58.979 --> 34:00.715
Rex Sit

34:00.815 --> 34:03.682
There it is. I got it.

34:03.751 --> 34:06.320
I'm gon' nail yo' ass.
Enough, I say.

34:06.420 --> 34:09.355
I'm gon' nail yo' ass. Yeah.

34:09.422 --> 34:12.592
Yeah, I'm gon' nail yo' ass.
A silly misunderstanding...

34:12.693 --> 34:14.693
Get that thing off me.

34:14.694 --> 34:16.596
Yeah, I'm gon' nail yo' ass.

34:16.696 --> 34:20.860
I'm gon' nail yo' ass.
I'm gon' nail your ass.

34:31.344 --> 34:33.112
Devastated

34:33.213 --> 34:35.213
Simply devastated

34:36.514 --> 34:38.514
Thank you, Mrs Rexroth

34:41.087 --> 34:43.577
Mr Massey, any questions?

35:13.484 --> 35:15.484
'Dismiss your vows,

35:15.487 --> 35:17.388
'your feigned tears, your flattery,

35:17.488 --> 35:20.358
for where a heart is hard
they make no battery '

35:20.458 --> 35:22.894
Mrs Rexroth, do you know those
lines? Objection, Your Honor...

35:22.994 --> 35:26.987
Grounds?
- Uh, poetry recitation

35:27.065 --> 35:30.192
Let me rephrase Mrs Rexroth...

35:30.268 --> 35:33.805
...how high is that wall around your heart?

35:33.905 --> 35:35.807
Your Honor, this is harassment,

35:35.907 --> 35:39.409
and, frankly,
it's still a little, uh, arty-farty...

35:39.509 --> 35:41.313
Rephrase Mrs Rexroth, have
you ever been in love?

35:41.413 --> 35:42.413
Yes

35:42.513 --> 35:44.513
Of course

35:45.515 --> 35:47.385
With Rex

35:47.485 --> 35:50.419
And you've always loved him?

35:50.488 --> 35:53.156
'Whoever loved
that loved not at first sight?'

35:53.256 --> 35:55.256
S...

35:58.828 --> 36:02.900
So it's your sworn testimony
that you have loved Rex Rexroth...

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
...since first you met?

36:08.105 --> 36:10.105
Yes

36:11.107 --> 36:13.575
Thank you

36:13.642 --> 36:15.544
No further questions,
Your Honor

36:15.644 --> 36:17.737
Who's next, Mr Bender?

36:17.813 --> 36:20.373
We rest, Your Honor
- Mr Massey

36:20.449 --> 36:24.449
Your Honor, I call Heinz,
the Baron Krauss von Espy

36:33.128 --> 36:35.031
Heinz, the Baron Krauss von Espy.

36:35.131 --> 36:36.765
Problem?
Puffy

36:36.865 --> 36:40.860

Tenzing Norgay

37:02.223 --> 37:05.126

37:07.829 --> 37:09.564
Baron Krauss von Espy

37:09.664 --> 37:11.017
Solemnly swear that the testimony
you are about to give...

37:11.117 --> 37:12.567
...shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth,

37:12.667 --> 37:14.068
so help you God?

37:14.168 --> 37:16.208
Mais bien sûr
- No maybes

37:16.271 --> 37:18.605
Mais bien sûr But of course, yes

37:18.705 --> 37:22.437
The baron does not lie Have a seat, sir

37:22.510 --> 37:24.510
Did you sleep with him?

37:24.511 --> 37:26.146
Don't be a fool

37:26.246 --> 37:29.561
Shush, Elsbieta Shush-shush-shush-shush

37:31.285 --> 37:33.954
Baron von Espy,
what is your profession?

37:34.054 --> 37:36.784
Silly man I am a baron

37:36.857 --> 37:39.760
Yes, but do you not also hold a day job?

37:39.860 --> 37:42.410
Paying job A, uh, a square job

37:42.461 --> 37:44.461
Well, one has to live

37:44.465 --> 37:47.366
I am the concierge
of Les Pantalons Rouges...

37:47.466 --> 37:50.746
...at Bad-Gadesbourg in the canton of Uri

37:50.771 --> 37:52.605
And what does that job entail?

37:52.705 --> 37:56.442
I satisfy such requests
as the clientele may present

37:56.542 --> 37:59.204
Towels, ice, et cetera?

37:59.278 --> 38:01.114
We have bellmen for that No, no, no

38:01.214 --> 38:05.017
Such requests that, were you at home,
you would address not to your valet...

38:05.117 --> 38:07.117
...but to your majordomo

38:07.118 --> 38:08.688
Shush, poochy-chow

38:08.788 --> 38:10.889
I see Baron, do you recognize that woman?

38:10.989 --> 38:14.426
Ah, cher Marylin But of course

38:14.492 --> 38:16.984
Look who is here Hi.

38:19.065 --> 38:23.092
And she was a guest of the Red Trousers?

38:23.169 --> 38:25.729
Oh, many times,

38:25.805 --> 38:29.290
for relaxing and making Alpine recreation

38:30.643 --> 38:33.545
Mm-hmm I am curious about
her visit of five years ago

38:33.645 --> 38:36.273
January 1998

38:36.348 --> 38:39.584
Can you remember any specific
request she made at that time?

38:39.684 --> 38:40.684
Yes, I can

38:40.784 --> 38:44.221
At what, at that time, did
she tell you she required?

38:44.321 --> 38:47.291
She said that she required...

38:47.359 --> 38:49.359
...a husband.

38:51.795 --> 38:55.267
Do you want some bones? Huh?
Does Elsbieta want some bones?

38:55.367 --> 38:57.202
Has anyone any bones?

38:57.302 --> 39:01.071
Does anyone have any bones?
B... Uh, bones? Dog candies?

39:01.171 --> 39:05.042
No, they are not candies Milk-Bones
Hard, crunchy bones for the teeth

39:05.142 --> 39:07.235
Uh, hard, uh...

39:07.311 --> 39:10.439
We'll attend to the dog later

39:10.514 --> 39:12.348
Now, Baron...

39:12.448 --> 39:14.575
Where were we?

39:17.186 --> 39:19.590
'She said that she required a husband...

39:19.690 --> 39:21.592
'Oh, do you want some bones?

39:21.692 --> 39:23.560
'Does Elsbieta want some bones?

39:23.660 --> 39:26.030
Has anyone any bones?
Hard, crunchy bones for the...'

39:26.130 --> 39:28.130
Right

39:28.132 --> 39:30.967
Now, a husband That's an unusual request

39:31.067 --> 39:33.970
Did she specify what kind
of a husband she was looking for?

39:34.070 --> 39:36.070
Stop him Objection...

39:36.072 --> 39:39.472
Grounds?
- Uh hearsay

39:39.542 --> 39:41.161
It's not secondhand, Your
Honor This is direct...

39:41.261 --> 39:42.812
...testimony about the
baron's own conversation...

39:42.912 --> 39:46.076
I'm going to allow it
- Yeah

39:46.149 --> 39:49.352
She said she wanted a very rich husband

39:49.452 --> 39:54.623
She wanted to know the businesses and
the wealths-s... the wealths-s-s...

39:54.723 --> 39:59.990
Can I say this?
Wealths of our various eligible guests

40:00.062 --> 40:02.464
And did she have any other specifications?

40:02.564 --> 40:05.901
Objection, Your Honor Inflammatory
- What's good for the gander, Your Honor...

40:06.001 --> 40:08.092
Is this a legal argument...'What's
good for the gander'?

40:08.192 --> 40:09.404
You got to play your tape, Freddy

40:09.504 --> 40:12.406
Mr Massey has a point there
I'm going to allow it

40:12.506 --> 40:14.976
Were there any other specifications?

40:15.076 --> 40:18.103
She 'specificated' a silly man

40:18.180 --> 40:21.016
Objection, Your Honor.
I'm going to allow it

40:21.116 --> 40:24.853
She 'specificated' a man who,
though clever at making money,

40:24.953 --> 40:27.022
would be easily duped and controlled

40:27.122 --> 40:30.025
Objection, Your Honor Shut
up, Freddy She's allowing it

40:30.125 --> 40:33.127
She 'specificated'a man
with a wandering pee-pee

40:33.227 --> 40:37.698
How you say? Aphilanderer whose affairs
would be transparent to the world

40:37.798 --> 40:39.200
Objection, Your Honor.

40:39.300 --> 40:43.604
Finally, a man whom
she could herself brazenly cuckold...

40:43.704 --> 40:46.307
...until such time
as she might choose to, uh...

40:46.407 --> 40:49.310
We would say, 'faire un coup
de marteau sur des fesses '

40:49.410 --> 40:51.978
You would say,
'make hammer on his fanny'

40:52.078 --> 40:55.281
Your Honor, Objection. L-Irrelevant.
- I'm going to allow it.

40:55.381 --> 40:58.885
Tell us, Baron...
Did you introduce her to such a man?

40:58.985 --> 41:00.521
Sir, I am the concierge.

41:00.621 --> 41:03.623
And to whom did you introduce
that calculating woman?

41:03.723 --> 41:06.089
I introduced her...

41:06.159 --> 41:08.253
...to that silly man

41:08.329 --> 41:09.963
Your Honor, objection.

41:10.063 --> 41:14.067
Let the record show that the baron
has identified Rex Rexroth as the silly man.

41:14.167 --> 41:15.902
I did it. It was I.

41:16.002 --> 41:18.802
I introduced her to that silly man.

41:18.805 --> 41:22.509
You son of a bitch. - The
red-faced angry one I introduced them.

41:22.609 --> 41:25.737
Absolument.
I did it. It was I.

41:25.811 --> 41:27.811
I just love trains.

41:27.814 --> 41:30.215
I love trains.
If you please, sir.

41:30.315 --> 41:33.752
I'm not sick.
You're the one who's sick.

41:33.820 --> 41:36.686
No...
If you please...

41:36.755 --> 41:39.223
Not the larynx.

41:39.291 --> 41:41.093
Objection, Your Honor.
Strangling the witness.

41:41.193 --> 41:43.193
I'm going to allow it

41:46.131 --> 41:47.433
Well, I think it stinks

41:47.533 --> 41:49.435
They left you with nothing

41:49.535 --> 41:52.438
Makes you wonder about
the entire legal system,

41:52.538 --> 41:54.440
like Rodney what's-his-name

41:54.540 --> 41:57.005
They bought Massey's argument

41:57.042 --> 41:59.944
If I lied or cheated
and was with Rex only for his money,

42:00.044 --> 42:01.880
then he shouldn't have to give me any

42:01.980 --> 42:05.116
Well, that makes no sense Why else
would you put in all those years?

42:05.216 --> 42:07.216
Oooh.

42:07.219 --> 42:09.653
Are you all right,
Sarah?

42:09.720 --> 42:11.720
Yeah Wh-What is it?

42:11.722 --> 42:13.722
Peptic ulcer

42:13.724 --> 42:18.763
I have medication, but I can't
take it before elective surgery

42:18.863 --> 42:22.143
You shouldn't be living here alone, Sarah

42:22.199 --> 42:24.469
My goddamn husbands gave me the ulcer

42:24.569 --> 42:26.903
But a bottle of Bromo can't love you back

42:27.003 --> 42:29.003
Yeah

42:29.006 --> 42:31.235
It's a catch-22

42:31.309 --> 42:34.444
I have to admit,
I don't like living alone

42:34.544 --> 42:36.447
I mean, do I need 46 rooms?

42:36.547 --> 42:38.741
You could see people

42:38.815 --> 42:40.815
It's risky Palimony

42:40.817 --> 42:43.752
Son of a bitch Marvin Mitchelson

42:43.820 --> 42:49.020
I'm telling you, honey, getting laid
is financial Russian roulette

42:49.059 --> 42:53.394
Maybe I shouldjust tear it all down,
build a cottage

42:53.730 --> 42:55.730
More landscaping

42:57.434 --> 43:01.834
Well, with my money,
I can't afford to be fooling around

43:01.870 --> 43:03.870
Besides, I have you

43:03.872 --> 43:06.192
It'll be fun...
just the girls

43:06.276 --> 43:11.114
Well, thanks, Sarah, but I can't
sleep on your couch forever

43:11.214 --> 43:13.648
I'm going to marry again,

43:13.717 --> 43:15.843
nail the guy's ass good

43:16.986 --> 43:20.641
And this time there'll be no Puffy von Espy

43:32.635 --> 43:34.635
Knock knock

43:34.637 --> 43:36.637
Excuse me Mr Donaly?

43:36.638 --> 43:38.638
Mr Donaly?

43:38.641 --> 43:41.041
Mr Donaly, excuse me

43:43.511 --> 43:45.511
You are Donovan Donaly?

43:45.513 --> 43:47.615
I'm in a meeting Mr Donaly

43:47.715 --> 43:49.775
I need a name

43:55.056 --> 44:00.071
And, of course, we will have to litigate
Sentence, paragraph

44:00.094 --> 44:02.564
Naturally, the first
concern for both parties...

44:02.664 --> 44:05.400
...is the welfare of little WendellJunior

44:05.500 --> 44:07.353
Nevertheless, we do question whether the...

44:07.453 --> 44:09.571
...continuing expenses for
his special ed classes...

44:09.671 --> 44:12.072
...are truly justified,
given the great strides...

44:12.172 --> 44:16.422
Mr Massey, the senior partner
would like to see you

44:17.411 --> 44:20.896
Herb wants to see me?
If you have a moment

44:53.979 --> 44:57.676
Fourteen summaryjudgments sought

44:58.919 --> 45:00.919
Thirteen granted

45:03.189 --> 45:07.392
Eighteen movements to void
for respondent's prejudice

45:07.492 --> 45:09.492
Eighteen granted

45:09.495 --> 45:13.320
Twelve court days
on the Rexroth case alone...

45:14.934 --> 45:20.269
...320 billable hours paralegal services...

45:21.706 --> 45:24.641
...680 billable...

45:24.709 --> 45:26.749
...at full attorney rate

45:29.114 --> 45:31.741
Eighty-five lunches charged

45:50.567 --> 45:52.933
Counselor...

45:54.304 --> 45:56.304
...you are the engine...

45:56.305 --> 45:58.345
...that drives this firm

46:06.450 --> 46:09.043
Mr Massey?

46:09.118 --> 46:11.118
Please, no calls

46:11.120 --> 46:13.023
I'm feeling a little fragile

46:13.123 --> 46:15.108
I'm sorry, Mr Massey, but
I felt certain you'd...

46:15.208 --> 46:17.027
...want to know Marylin
Rexroth wants to see you

46:17.127 --> 46:20.029
Marylin... Uh, uh, uh, w...
Uh, when did she, uh...

46:20.129 --> 46:22.129
She's here now

46:22.132 --> 46:25.066
Is she armed?
Give me a minute

46:36.012 --> 46:38.012
Marylin

46:38.014 --> 46:40.447
How nice of you to...

46:40.516 --> 46:42.516
Marylin?

46:42.517 --> 46:44.781
Shame on you

46:44.853 --> 46:46.853
Marylin

46:46.856 --> 46:48.856
What a lovely surprise

46:50.560 --> 46:52.925
Marylin, what a pl...

46:52.994 --> 46:55.331
Who the hell are you?
- Hello, Miles

46:55.431 --> 46:58.161
So nice of you to see us

47:00.035 --> 47:03.395
May I introduce Howard
D Doyle of Doyle Oil

47:03.471 --> 47:05.372
I'm goddamn pleased to meet you

47:05.472 --> 47:07.943
Marylin here, she says you're
the best Says you're aces

47:08.043 --> 47:10.738
Well, thank you, Mr, uh...

47:10.812 --> 47:15.249
Uh, any... any relation
toJohn D Doyle of Doyle Oil?

47:15.317 --> 47:18.386
Oh, you must be talkin' about
Grandpa John My papa's John D too

47:18.486 --> 47:21.388
The Deuce, we called him You
know, kinda the rebel of the family

47:21.488 --> 47:24.558
But they knocked off that wholeJohn D
routine when they christened Yours Truly

47:24.658 --> 47:26.627
Grandpa nearly had a stroke

47:26.727 --> 47:30.332
He did have a stroke, but that was
later, during the labor activity in '52

47:30.432 --> 47:32.333
The government stepped in Mm-hmm Uh...

47:32.433 --> 47:34.435
They called it mediation Well...

47:34.535 --> 47:36.470
He called it incipient communism

47:36.570 --> 47:38.471
Of course, that's when he had his stroke

47:38.571 --> 47:41.475
Golly, the whole left side of his body
is as useless as tits on a boar hog

47:41.575 --> 47:44.478
He lingered in a vegetative state for
years... Well, that is fascinating, Mr Doyle

47:44.578 --> 47:46.479
What say we have a seat?
A seat?

47:46.579 --> 47:49.984
Marylin's had me runnin'
up and down Rodeo Drive all day long

47:50.084 --> 47:52.987
Kinda hit-and-run shoppin', you know
Take no prisoners

47:53.087 --> 47:55.990
Forced march kind of thing
My God, my dogs are barkin'

47:56.090 --> 47:58.992
We started out at this li'I ol' place right
off of Wilshire... It's been quite a day

47:59.092 --> 48:00.927
Had pewter things

48:01.027 --> 48:03.720
But anyway, Miles, I know
you're busy and you...

48:03.820 --> 48:06.799
...charge by the hour, so I'll
get straight to the point

48:06.899 --> 48:09.959
Howard D and I are planning to marry

48:13.538 --> 48:15.538
Well...

48:15.540 --> 48:18.977
Well, I suppose that congratulations
are in order Well, thank you, Miles

48:19.077 --> 48:21.863
You know, the urge to wedlock
and form a lastin'monogamous...

48:21.963 --> 48:24.284
...bond sanctified by ritual,
it's pert-near universal

48:24.384 --> 48:28.320
As a matter of fact, it might be of some
interest to you, bein'in a related business...

48:28.420 --> 48:31.323
Even your indigenous Americans...
Uh, I believe it was your Cree... used to...

48:31.423 --> 48:35.328
Howard and I are here because I've
learned, through bitter experience,

48:35.428 --> 48:39.565
that when it comes to matrimony
and law, you are the very best

48:39.665 --> 48:43.702
And as you are well aware,
my previous marriage...

48:43.802 --> 48:47.203
...ended in an unjustified stain...

48:47.272 --> 48:49.272
...upon my reputation

48:49.273 --> 48:51.273
My motives were impugned

48:51.275 --> 48:53.608
I was slandered in court

48:53.679 --> 48:56.374
I was painted a harlot

48:56.447 --> 48:58.349
Oh, honey, you ain't no harlot

48:58.449 --> 49:00.449
Oh, yes, honey

49:00.451 --> 49:04.889
So it's my desire to remove
any trace of suspicion...

49:04.956 --> 49:08.516
...from the mind of my dear Howard Doyle

49:08.591 --> 49:10.591
Oh, honey, come on, now

49:10.594 --> 49:12.897
I wish to execute a prenuptial agreement

49:12.997 --> 49:16.400
And I'm dead-set against it
I mean, just anti the whole deal

49:16.500 --> 49:18.401
Howard's lawyers prefer it

49:18.501 --> 49:20.501
I insist upon it

49:20.504 --> 49:24.208
Oh, damn lawyers Uh, no offense to the
present company or anything, you know

49:24.308 --> 49:29.112
Now, is it my understanding that the
Massey prenup has never been penetrated?

49:29.212 --> 49:31.212
That is correct

49:31.214 --> 49:34.217
Not to blow my own horn, but they devote
an entire semester to it at Harvard Law

49:34.317 --> 49:37.255
They got a hell of a school up there,
ain't no doubt about it

49:37.355 --> 49:40.256
We donated that Doyle building
up there here a while back Mm-hmm

49:40.356 --> 49:43.093
Now, I myself went to Texas A&M
I'm an Aggie...

49:43.193 --> 49:45.193
Business?
- Tight end

49:45.195 --> 49:48.098
And I had a fair amount of success
against the split-T defense

49:48.198 --> 49:50.634
See, when they line up
symmetrical thataway,

49:50.734 --> 49:52.625
it allows me to buttonhook
and, you know, do a...

49:52.725 --> 49:54.536
...down-and-in, up-and-out
and different things...

49:54.636 --> 49:56.705
...post pattern every now and then

49:56.805 --> 49:58.708
Your tight ends don't generally run a post

49:58.808 --> 50:00.943
But if the QB calls it,
hell, I'm ready

50:01.043 --> 50:02.277
Interrupt for a second?
Yeah

50:02.377 --> 50:07.216
I wanna make sure that you both
understand what it is you're asking

50:07.316 --> 50:11.120
The Massey prenup provides that in the
event of a dissolution of the marriage,

50:11.220 --> 50:13.220
for any reason,

50:13.222 --> 50:17.159
both parties will leave it with what
they brought in and earned during

50:17.259 --> 50:20.234
No one can profit from the marriage

50:20.261 --> 50:23.432
The prenup protects the wealthier party

50:23.532 --> 50:28.594
Without it, that party is exposed,
a sitting duck

50:28.669 --> 50:31.572
Not a hell of a lot of romance in that

50:31.672 --> 50:34.108
No, sir, there is not No romance

50:34.208 --> 50:36.848
More to the point,
no wriggle room

50:36.878 --> 50:40.279
So, are we sure...

50:41.315 --> 50:43.283
...that this is what we want?

50:43.383 --> 50:45.851
Absolutely

50:47.355 --> 50:49.355
It's my gift to Howard,

50:49.357 --> 50:52.052
for his peace of mind,

50:52.125 --> 50:55.363
whether or not he's worried
about it at this moment

50:55.463 --> 50:58.728
Oh, honey pie,
do I look worried?

51:02.669 --> 51:04.669
Excuse me, Mr Doyle

51:04.671 --> 51:07.574
Could I just borrow your
charming fiancée for a moment?

51:07.674 --> 51:10.734
Well, okay You gon' leave a deposit?

51:16.249 --> 51:18.683
What are you up to?

51:18.752 --> 51:21.712
Something you won't understand, Miles

51:21.755 --> 51:24.156
Howard and I are very much in love

51:24.256 --> 51:26.318
I don't know what you're
thinking, but I have to...

51:26.418 --> 51:28.562
...warn you, the Massey prenup
has never been penetrated

51:28.662 --> 51:32.325
You sign the prenup,
you can't get his money

51:32.399 --> 51:34.333
Thanks for the professional help

51:34.433 --> 51:37.337
Marylin, think of me for a moment...

51:37.437 --> 51:40.582
...not as an attorney but as a friend

51:40.639 --> 51:43.541
Does that mean you won't be
charging us for the hour?

51:43.641 --> 51:46.611
Dump him You can't nail his ass

51:48.347 --> 51:50.347
Is that all?

51:52.450 --> 51:54.450
No, that's not all

52:11.102 --> 52:14.077
I could have you disbarred for that

52:14.672 --> 52:16.672
It was worth it

52:18.711 --> 52:21.006
A romantic divorce attorney

52:26.351 --> 52:28.648
You fascinate me

52:35.959 --> 52:39.614
I'll get right on it I'll whip something up

52:40.398 --> 52:42.398
All right Thank you

52:43.400 --> 52:46.494
How's Lionel?
He's fine

52:46.570 --> 52:51.743
He asked me to deliver the keynote address
at this year's convention in Vegas

52:51.843 --> 52:53.377
That's quite an honor

52:53.477 --> 52:55.379
I suppose On top of a great victory

52:55.479 --> 52:56.915
What was that?

52:57.015 --> 52:59.015
'What was that'?

52:59.016 --> 53:01.016
Um, Rex Rexroth?

53:01.018 --> 53:06.968
He kept everything? You win? No
compromise? Isn't that what you wanted?

53:07.089 --> 53:10.829
Oh, good God, Miles
What are you looking for?

53:11.961 --> 53:13.961
I don't know

53:15.565 --> 53:17.565
Okay, I won

53:19.568 --> 53:21.568
What then?

53:21.571 --> 53:24.473
How many cases has Herb Myerson won?

53:24.573 --> 53:27.777
The old man? More than anybody
He's a legend And look at him

53:27.877 --> 53:31.547
He's 87 years old, he's the first
one into the office in the morning...

53:31.647 --> 53:32.647
No home life

53:32.747 --> 53:34.617
Who needs a home when
you have a colostomy bag?

53:34.717 --> 53:37.085
She can't really love this dope,
can she?

53:37.185 --> 53:39.949
Who? Uh, who loves who?

53:40.021 --> 53:42.021
Marylin Rexroth

53:42.023 --> 53:45.593
She signed a prenup for an oil millionaire

53:45.628 --> 53:49.996
A Massey prenup?

53:51.900 --> 53:53.900
Yeah

53:53.902 --> 53:57.047
Well, then she is not after his money

53:58.073 --> 54:02.009
Only love is in mind if the Massey is signed

54:13.254 --> 54:16.985
April

54:17.057 --> 54:19.057
Come she will

54:20.127 --> 54:25.155
When streams are ripe
and swelled with rain

54:25.231 --> 54:29.827
Nay, she will stay

54:30.904 --> 54:33.896
A- resting in my arms again

54:45.518 --> 54:47.687
What the hell's wrong with you?

54:47.787 --> 54:50.517
April

54:50.590 --> 54:52.590
Come she will

54:57.697 --> 55:00.600
Thank you for coming to this celebration...

55:00.700 --> 55:04.437
...of the love between our two friends,
Marylin and Howard

55:04.537 --> 55:06.971
In today's cynical world,

55:07.039 --> 55:10.243
it's so hard to take that great leap of faith...

55:10.343 --> 55:13.303
...aboard the ship of love and caring

55:13.312 --> 55:16.883
But today Marylin and Howard
are taking that leap...

55:16.983 --> 55:19.284
...and telling us, their friends,

55:19.384 --> 55:22.221
that they do believe,
that they do have faith,

55:22.321 --> 55:24.321
that they do love

55:24.322 --> 55:27.190
Do you, Howard Drexler Doyle,

55:27.259 --> 55:31.196
take Marylin to be your shipmate
on this journey through life,

55:31.296 --> 55:35.200
through gale and doldrum,
seas choppy, wild and calm?

55:35.300 --> 55:37.300
Yes, I do, Father Scott

55:39.303 --> 55:40.659
And do you, Marylin Rexroth, take

55:40.759 --> 55:42.541
Howard to be your
shipmate and companion...

55:42.641 --> 55:44.542
...to ports of every clime,

55:44.642 --> 55:47.510
Be it in first class or steerage?

55:47.579 --> 55:49.738
I do

55:49.813 --> 55:52.617
Then, by the power vested in me
by the State of California,

55:52.717 --> 55:55.419
and as captain
of the good ship Amore Veritas,

55:55.519 --> 55:58.682
I now pronounce you man and wife

56:17.675 --> 56:19.675
What do you think?

56:20.978 --> 56:24.038
What are they, ladles?
- Berry spoons

56:24.047 --> 56:26.047
Spoons?
Berry spoons

56:26.050 --> 56:28.952
Everybody has spoons And
nobody needs berry spoons

56:29.052 --> 56:31.187
Everybody eats berries
Who are you, Pollyanna?

56:31.287 --> 56:34.157
Hey, everybody. Folks. Hey,
y'all. Where'd you see 'em at?

56:34.257 --> 56:37.159
A Martha Stewart catalog
right next to the silver napkin rings?

56:37.259 --> 56:39.662
I need your attention for a
minute Stadium seat ass-warmers?

56:39.762 --> 56:40.803
Dear God, Wrigley,
how many cockamamie...

56:40.903 --> 56:41.997
...personal possessions
do we have to amass...

56:42.097 --> 56:44.097
Why so angry?

56:44.100 --> 56:46.425
Now, I know it's not common
practice for the groom...

56:46.525 --> 56:48.537
...to give his bride a
gift on their weddin' day,

56:48.637 --> 56:51.527
but ever since I met Marylin there

56:51.541 --> 56:55.026
I can't seem to quit givin' her things...

56:56.278 --> 56:59.781
And I don't wanna stop
'cause it feels so durn good.

56:59.881 --> 57:02.718
Chow Sing, bring that barbecue sauce
over here, little buddy

57:02.818 --> 57:04.818
There you go

57:04.820 --> 57:07.549
Put that thing on my neck now

57:07.622 --> 57:09.625
Now, honey,
it's like the padre said

57:09.725 --> 57:11.627
I want love and trust between us

57:11.727 --> 57:14.362
Love and trust and not a thing else

57:14.462 --> 57:18.457
And this here deed
that I'm fixin' to perform...

57:20.668 --> 57:23.303
Well, honey, let me just, uh...

57:25.973 --> 57:27.973
You see this?

57:36.349 --> 57:38.443
This is for you, darlin;

57:38.518 --> 57:41.385
This here is for you

57:41.455 --> 57:43.357
This here is for you, baby

57:43.457 --> 57:46.517
Ever'last little speck of it

57:46.593 --> 57:48.593
I love you

57:48.596 --> 57:52.081
I mean, I love you like a son of a bitch.

57:52.432 --> 57:54.432
I trust you.

57:56.169 --> 57:58.739
This here is for you, baby Brilliant.

57:58.839 --> 58:00.373
Baby, this is for you

58:00.473 --> 58:02.310
What is it?
I really love you

58:02.410 --> 58:05.071
It's the prenup

58:05.145 --> 58:06.713
I love her.

58:06.813 --> 58:09.441
I trust her.

58:09.516 --> 58:11.418
Ladies and gentlemen,
It's the prenup.

58:11.518 --> 58:13.781
I trust her.
Brilliant.

58:17.289 --> 58:19.289
You look beautiful

58:19.291 --> 58:22.226
Ladies,
if you'll excuse us

58:22.294 --> 58:24.489
We have to talk

58:24.563 --> 58:26.967
I would like to offer my congratulations

58:27.067 --> 58:29.968
It was a beautiful gesture of Howard's

58:30.068 --> 58:32.638
Well, Howard is a beautiful person

58:32.738 --> 58:34.738
A diamond in the rough

58:34.740 --> 58:36.975
And I have a feeling that someday soon...

58:37.075 --> 58:39.978
...you'll be taking that diamond
and leaving the rough

58:40.078 --> 58:44.450
In a month or so, once I've established
that I've tried to make the marriage work

58:44.550 --> 58:47.950
May I offer my services?
Oh, thanks

58:48.019 --> 58:50.019
But no

58:50.022 --> 58:51.924
No, I'm retaining Freddy Bender

58:52.024 --> 58:54.560
Poor Freddy He was awfully blue
after my last divorce

58:54.660 --> 58:56.561
Well, I admire your loyalty

58:56.661 --> 58:58.661
To lawyers, anyway

58:58.664 --> 59:01.833
I guess without the prenup
it's something even Freddy could manage

59:01.933 --> 59:04.837
But how did you get Howard to do it?

59:04.937 --> 59:06.838
It felt like it was his idea

59:06.938 --> 59:09.841
Surely, Mr Massey,
you've addressed enough juries...

59:09.941 --> 59:12.777
...to appreciate the power of suggestion

59:12.877 --> 59:15.175
Mmm

59:15.246 --> 59:18.180
Wish I was a Kellogg's Corn Flake

59:18.249 --> 59:21.285
Look, now that the marriage
is winding down,

59:21.385 --> 59:23.385
have dinner with me

59:24.755 --> 59:26.755
No

59:26.757 --> 59:30.160
No, nothing doing until
the ink is dry on the settlement

59:30.260 --> 59:32.728
Oh, this'll be no settlement

59:32.796 --> 59:38.368
If I know Marylin Rexroth, this'll be
nothing short of a complete and total...

59:38.468 --> 59:40.468
...annihilation

59:58.554 --> 01:00:01.682
You're gonna win Excuse me?

01:00:01.757 --> 01:00:05.294
I can always tell, going
to Vegas, who's gonna win

01:00:05.394 --> 01:00:09.228
Well, thanks,
but I'm going on business

01:00:09.298 --> 01:00:12.164
I always win

01:00:12.234 --> 01:00:20.663
Yeah

01:00:22.844 --> 01:00:24.844
Yeah

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:28.317
You know why I hate this town,
Wrigley?

01:00:28.417 --> 01:00:30.738
You see, people get to
Las Vegas, and all of a...

01:00:30.838 --> 01:00:33.255
...sudden, the rules of the
moral universe don't apply

01:00:33.355 --> 01:00:35.758
When God is dead,
all things are possible

01:00:35.858 --> 01:00:37.858
I saw an ad in the paper:

01:00:37.859 --> 01:00:42.728
'No-fault divorce...
two-week divorce without a lawyer'

01:00:42.797 --> 01:00:46.134
Made me sick to my stomach
'No-fault divorce'

01:00:46.234 --> 01:00:49.532
Good God Talk about your oxymoron

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:52.541
What's the world comin' to?
One man can only do so much

01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:55.442
One man... What are you talkin' about?

01:00:55.542 --> 01:00:58.579
Freddy
- I had lunch with Freddy Bender yesterday

01:00:58.679 --> 01:01:02.016
He tells me that Marylin Rexroth-Doyle
is now richer than Croesus

01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:05.771
Ah, yes, but is she richer
than Mrs Croesus?

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:09.697
She could buy and sell
you 10 times over She...

01:01:10.289 --> 01:01:13.520
My God, is that her?
- Mmm

01:01:13.593 --> 01:01:17.231
Freddy said she was flying in with him
Celebrating, I guess

01:01:17.331 --> 01:01:20.968
I'm fascinated by that creature
Richer than me, huh?

01:01:21.068 --> 01:01:23.695
Well, she deserves every penny

01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:28.070
And now she's single again Excuse me

01:01:28.141 --> 01:01:30.810
No You should stay away from her, Miles

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:34.735
Recite your keynote address
Take a cold shower

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.783
You're looking well,
Marylin Hello, Miles

01:01:44.856 --> 01:01:47.792
Obscene wealth becomes you

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:51.660
I should've known you'd be here Be here?

01:01:51.731 --> 01:01:54.634
I'm the keynote speaker
Oh, how nice for you...

01:01:54.734 --> 01:01:57.870
'Nailing Your Spouse's Assets' Excuse me?

01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:01.496
My speech Oh.

01:02:01.573 --> 01:02:04.610
Oh, I'm sure you'll bring the house down

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:06.710
It's an easy crowd

01:02:06.712 --> 01:02:09.124
At this point, I would
think you're probably...

01:02:09.224 --> 01:02:11.583
...the only person that
I can't teach anything to

01:02:11.683 --> 01:02:13.708
Really?
Mmm

01:02:13.785 --> 01:02:18.089
Now, correct me,
but since by now the ink must be dry,

01:02:18.189 --> 01:02:20.791
I believe I have the right to collect

01:02:20.891 --> 01:02:25.030
On? You promised to have dinner
with me once you were free

01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:29.100
I said I wouldn't whilst I wasn't,
which implies no promise once I am

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.760
Noted Let me rephrase

01:02:31.836 --> 01:02:36.341
I would be delighted...
honored, really... if you'd...

01:02:37.976 --> 01:02:40.135
Howard.
Ow. Howard.

01:02:40.211 --> 01:02:42.701
Howard.

01:02:42.781 --> 01:02:46.841
You named him after
your ex I'm sentimental

01:02:46.917 --> 01:02:52.656
Well, I'm free this evening, so I
suppose a little dinner would do no harm

01:02:52.756 --> 01:02:56.215
Le Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin,
1990, sir

01:02:56.292 --> 01:03:00.753
Yes Thank you I'll take care of it

01:03:01.765 --> 01:03:05.099
Marylin, this is a moment to savor

01:03:05.169 --> 01:03:08.261
Yes, we were adversaries,

01:03:08.337 --> 01:03:11.569
but we were also professionals

01:03:11.641 --> 01:03:16.976
So let us raise a glass to friendship

01:03:19.515 --> 01:03:22.041
To victory

01:03:25.155 --> 01:03:29.182
So, how does it feel?

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:33.387
Sorry?
Victory Independence

01:03:33.462 --> 01:03:36.022
Oh, um...

01:03:38.066 --> 01:03:43.251
Well, frankly, Miles...
- It's not everything you'd hoped for?

01:03:46.708 --> 01:03:49.268
I know the feeling

01:03:49.343 --> 01:03:53.405
Independence Two-edged sword

01:03:54.616 --> 01:03:58.271
My friend... My best friend...
Sarah Sorkin?

01:03:59.654 --> 01:04:02.123
Sarah Battista-O'Flanagan-Sorkin?

01:04:02.223 --> 01:04:04.953
The O'Flanagan settlement?

01:04:06.394 --> 01:04:09.420
Ahh
- Hmm...

01:04:09.497 --> 01:04:13.694
Huh
- Anyway, three fine settlements

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:16.036
More money
than she could ever hope to spend

01:04:16.136 --> 01:04:18.516
Yes Her vaunted independence

01:04:18.572 --> 01:04:21.279
Don't tell me She sits around
the house, afraid to...

01:04:21.379 --> 01:04:23.878
...see people, afraid to
put her portfolio into play

01:04:23.978 --> 01:04:28.312
And only a peptic ulcer
to keep her warm at night

01:04:28.382 --> 01:04:30.382
Yes

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:35.288
There's a certain point
when you've achieved your goals

01:04:35.388 --> 01:04:39.416
You realize that you're still not satisfied

01:04:39.493 --> 01:04:41.493
Yes

01:04:47.834 --> 01:04:49.834
We should order

01:04:51.738 --> 01:04:55.537
You know,
I'm not really hungry

01:04:56.676 --> 01:04:58.769
Neither am I

01:05:21.267 --> 01:05:24.236
Shh...

01:05:41.386 --> 01:05:45.049
...1,800 billable hours...

01:05:45.123 --> 01:05:50.652
...1,221 motions to void...

01:05:50.728 --> 01:05:56.291
...564 summary judgments...

01:05:56.367 --> 01:06:02.203
...129,999 lunches charged

01:06:18.755 --> 01:06:21.485
Hello?

01:06:21.558 --> 01:06:26.586
Miles?
Hello? Marylin?

01:06:26.663 --> 01:06:28.893
Sarah Sorkin just died.

01:06:31.601 --> 01:06:33.203
Marylin.

01:06:33.303 --> 01:06:35.303
Her ulcer...

01:06:36.773 --> 01:06:38.866
...perforated

01:06:38.942 --> 01:06:42.206
Infection Yes

01:06:43.579 --> 01:06:47.447
Miles?
Yes, Marylin?

01:06:47.516 --> 01:06:49.847
She was alone

01:06:49.918 --> 01:06:55.613
She'd been dead for two days
before her Pilates instructor found her

01:06:57.893 --> 01:07:00.053
Marylin, listen to me

01:07:00.129 --> 01:07:03.224
No arguments No discussions I'll have

01:07:03.324 --> 01:07:07.489
Wrigley meet us at the
Wee Kirk o' the Heather...

01:07:09.472 --> 01:07:10.472
Wrigley.

01:07:10.572 --> 01:07:13.141
The vows are from an Arapaho
dawn greeting ceremony

01:07:13.241 --> 01:07:17.413
The music is Simon and Garfunkel
And this is the Massey prenup

01:07:17.513 --> 01:07:21.883
You the two gettin' married?
- Mr MacKinnon here will be officiating

01:07:21.983 --> 01:07:24.416
Sorry Short notice Pen

01:07:24.485 --> 01:07:27.922
Marylin, you're welcome to examine this

01:07:27.989 --> 01:07:31.857
This is the Massey prenup

01:07:31.926 --> 01:07:34.895
As you know, it's ironclad
We tried to reach Freddy Bender

01:07:34.995 --> 01:07:36.664
We tried to reach Freddy, to
have him here for your...

01:07:36.764 --> 01:07:38.465
...protection, but we couldn't
find him I couldn't get him

01:07:38.565 --> 01:07:41.168
Are you two here to get married
or to bullshit?

01:07:41.268 --> 01:07:44.587
So you can't hope to
benefit from the marriage?

01:07:44.687 --> 01:07:45.640
Not in any way

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:49.077
And my wealth is completely...
completely protected?

01:07:49.177 --> 01:07:52.747
As if a lead veil had been drawn across it

01:08:01.055 --> 01:08:04.795
Do you still want to
marry me? More than ever

01:08:07.661 --> 01:08:10.027
Are ya rentin' kilts?

01:08:27.513 --> 01:08:30.710
Do you, Miles Longfellow Massey,

01:08:30.783 --> 01:08:35.152

and Gurolnick, LLP,

Let me finish Jesus, have
you never been married before?

01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:52.861
To have and to hold, to love and
to cherish, till death do you part?

01:08:54.673 --> 01:08:57.233
I do

01:08:57.309 --> 01:09:01.268
And do you,
Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth-Doyle,

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:05.884

01:09:05.984 --> 01:09:10.154
to have and to hold, to love and
to cherish, till death do you part?

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:49.689
I'll take care of you later

01:10:00.237 --> 01:10:04.062
No, no, no, no, no No
This is all wrong Wha...

01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:07.639
Is it the kilt?

01:10:08.711 --> 01:10:13.114
Do you love me?
More than anything

01:10:13.183 --> 01:10:17.482
Can I trust you?
Yes You can trust me

01:10:25.995 --> 01:10:28.190
Darling, you're exposed

01:10:28.264 --> 01:10:30.697
A sitting duck

01:10:49.184 --> 01:10:52.420
I hereby declare the 12th Congress
of the National Organization...

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:56.616
...of Matrimonial Attorneys Nationwide open

01:10:56.691 --> 01:10:59.775
As our first order of
business, it is a privilege...

01:10:59.875 --> 01:11:02.296
...to call to the podium our keynote speaker

01:11:02.396 --> 01:11:07.201
From the Los Angeles firm
of Massey, Myerson, Sloan and Gurolnick,

01:11:07.301 --> 01:11:12.039
a man whose name is synonymous
with bitter disputes and big awards,

01:11:12.139 --> 01:11:14.139
Miles Massey

01:11:32.459 --> 01:11:34.459
Thank you, Branco

01:11:39.032 --> 01:11:41.032
In the world of...

01:11:44.303 --> 01:11:48.070
In the world of matrimonial law,
there are...

01:11:55.481 --> 01:12:00.666
In the world of matrimonial law,
there are multiple tactics...

01:12:16.368 --> 01:12:18.368
Friends,

01:12:21.006 --> 01:12:23.975
this morning I stand before you
a very different Miles Massey...

01:12:24.075 --> 01:12:26.711
...than the one that
addressed you last year...

01:12:26.811 --> 01:12:30.082
...on the disposition of marital assets
following murder/suicide

01:12:30.182 --> 01:12:35.282
I wish to talk to you today
not about technical matters oflaw

01:12:36.821 --> 01:12:41.156
I wish to talk to you
about something more important

01:12:42.493 --> 01:12:45.808
I wish to talk to you from the heart...

01:12:51.035 --> 01:12:56.405
...because today for the first time in my life,

01:12:56.473 --> 01:13:00.877
I stand before you naked...

01:13:04.882 --> 01:13:06.940
...vulnerable

01:13:08.952 --> 01:13:12.978
And in love

01:13:19.363 --> 01:13:21.592
Love

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:26.299
It's a word we matrimonial lawyers avoid

01:13:27.337 --> 01:13:30.540
Funny, isn't it? We're frightened of
this emotion, which is, in a sense,

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.850
the seed of our livelihood

01:13:34.177 --> 01:13:37.246
Well, today Miles Massey
is here to tell you...

01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:41.441
...that love need cause us no fear

01:13:43.885 --> 01:13:46.822
Love need cause us no shame

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:49.083
Love is...

01:13:49.157 --> 01:13:51.157
...good

01:13:57.233 --> 01:14:00.690
Love is good

01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:08.610
I am, of course, aware that these remarks
will be received here with cynicism

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:13.409
Cynicism, that cloak
that advertises our indifference...

01:14:13.481 --> 01:14:15.517
...and hides all human feeling

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:19.054
Well, I'm here to tell you that that cynicism
which we think protects us...

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:21.884
...in fact destroys

01:14:21.956 --> 01:14:25.289
Destroys love,
destroys our clients,

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.250
and, ultimately,
destroys ourselves

01:14:28.295 --> 01:14:33.467
Colleagues, when our clients come to us
confused and angry and hurting...

01:14:33.567 --> 01:14:37.138
...because their flame of love
is guttering and threatens to die,

01:14:37.238 --> 01:14:40.307
do we seek to extinguish that flame
so that we can sift...

01:14:40.407 --> 01:14:43.311
...through the smoldering wreckage
for our paltry reward,

01:14:43.411 --> 01:14:46.379
or do we fan this precious flame,

01:14:46.447 --> 01:14:51.248
this most precious flame,
back into loving, roaring life?

01:14:51.317 --> 01:14:55.344
Do we counsel fear or trust?

01:14:55.422 --> 01:14:57.725
Do we seek to destroy or build?

01:14:57.825 --> 01:15:02.352
Do we meet our clients'problems
with cynicism...

01:15:03.729 --> 01:15:05.729
...or with love?

01:15:11.771 --> 01:15:14.916
The choice is, of course,
each of ours

01:15:16.576 --> 01:15:20.947
For my part, I've made the leap of love,
and there's no going back

01:15:21.047 --> 01:15:24.283
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the last time I will address you...

01:15:24.383 --> 01:15:28.208
...as the president of NOMAN...
or as a member

01:15:30.889 --> 01:15:34.761
I intend to devote myself
to pro bono work in East Los Angeles...

01:15:34.861 --> 01:15:37.227
...or one of those other...

01:15:42.468 --> 01:15:44.468
God bless you all

01:16:33.083 --> 01:16:36.017
I love you, man

01:16:49.798 --> 01:16:53.335
So, Wrigley, I'm gonna be relinquishing
my partnership in Massey, Myerson

01:16:53.435 --> 01:16:57.706
If you'd care to join me in my
new endeavor, I'd be delighted

01:16:57.806 --> 01:16:59.293
Of course, I can't offer
you the same kind of...

01:16:59.393 --> 01:17:00.944
...financial remuneration
you've grown accustomed to,

01:17:01.044 --> 01:17:02.946
but the work'll have
to serve as its own reward

01:17:03.046 --> 01:17:06.615
Barkeep, we'll have two of your
finest scotches That's the, uh...

01:17:06.715 --> 01:17:08.239
I propose a toast Barkeep.

01:17:08.339 --> 01:17:11.620
That's... That's the soap
that used to belong to, uh...

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.591
Now, you'll be serving in a junior
capacity, of course Donovan Donaly...

01:17:14.691 --> 01:17:19.294
Miles, that's, uh... that's, uh... uh...
- It'll be a small operation, a boutique

01:17:19.394 --> 01:17:21.864
Let me tell you what they
called me in medical school

01:17:21.964 --> 01:17:25.334
The... I don't see why my
leadership skills should...

01:17:25.434 --> 01:17:27.902
Howard?
Mackenzie the Mechanical Marvel

01:17:28.002 --> 01:17:29.905
It's Howard You see, I have no nerves

01:17:30.005 --> 01:17:33.667
He's not an oil tycoon An actor

01:17:33.742 --> 01:17:37.199
Doctor, this is highly unusual

01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:40.873
So Marylin married a soap actor

01:17:40.949 --> 01:17:45.248
So she's...she's poor

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:49.023
Get yourself some clean scrubs
and have them prepare the OR...

01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:51.893
Well, thank God you have the prenup
- I have no prenup...

01:17:51.993 --> 01:17:54.529
You have no prenup
- I have no prenup

01:17:54.629 --> 01:17:56.629
You have no prenup

01:18:06.773 --> 01:18:08.900
Thanks

01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:10.976
Okay...

01:18:15.315 --> 01:18:19.479
Marylin?
- Oh, hello, Miles...

01:18:24.257 --> 01:18:27.624
Going back to LA?
- Yes

01:18:27.694 --> 01:18:31.698
Look, Miles, I think it's only fair
to warn you that after a decent interval,

01:18:31.798 --> 01:18:34.301
I intend to have Freddy seek an injunction...

01:18:34.401 --> 01:18:37.536
...that would forbid you to approach
within 500 feet of my house

01:18:37.636 --> 01:18:44.096
You mean, my house Oh, I believe the
residence will be part of the settlement

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:50.346
Marylin, didn't last night
mean anything to you?

01:18:50.416 --> 01:18:56.196
Oh Well, about as much as it'll
mean to you... half of your net worth

01:18:56.422 --> 01:19:00.191
Oh, Miles, you'll always be
my favorite husband

01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:03.351
But no more sentiment,
darling

01:19:03.428 --> 01:19:06.523
I really have to be going

01:19:06.598 --> 01:19:08.598
The dog's rented

01:19:17.842 --> 01:19:19.842
You didn't win

01:19:19.844 --> 01:19:21.844
Excuse me?

01:19:21.846 --> 01:19:26.647
I can always tell, comin'
back from Vegas, who didn't win

01:19:29.052 --> 01:19:31.453
You're right

01:19:34.759 --> 01:19:36.759
But...

01:19:37.861 --> 01:19:39.763
...you're going through with it?

01:19:39.863 --> 01:19:42.661
Yes

01:19:42.733 --> 01:19:46.270
I just felt so sorry for him for a minute there

01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:49.641
At the preliminary hearing,
he just looked so beaten

01:19:49.741 --> 01:19:52.643
Well, he was beaten, fair
and square I know, but...

01:19:52.743 --> 01:19:54.743
Oh, their pathetic look

01:19:54.778 --> 01:19:59.878
It's what they all fall back on
when they don't have a prenup

01:20:01.918 --> 01:20:05.055
Just stay strong until the divorce is final

01:20:05.155 --> 01:20:09.387
Relax and enjoy your pool

01:20:13.662 --> 01:20:17.147
Do you think he's eating enough? Marylin.

01:20:18.401 --> 01:20:21.893
This woman has humbled,

01:20:21.971 --> 01:20:26.772
Shamed and disgraced the entire firm...

01:20:26.843 --> 01:20:30.369
Yes, Herb
- Counselor...

01:20:30.445 --> 01:20:34.507
...this firm deals in power

01:20:34.584 --> 01:20:37.143
This firm deals in perception

01:20:38.821 --> 01:20:40.990
This firm cannot prosper...

01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:46.790
...nor long endure if it is perceived to be...

01:20:46.862 --> 01:20:50.354
...dancing to the music of a hurdy-gurdy.

01:20:50.432 --> 01:20:52.491
It's just...

01:20:54.302 --> 01:20:57.532
Herb, for the first time in my career,

01:20:57.572 --> 01:21:00.700
I don't know what to do

01:21:00.774 --> 01:21:05.270
I'm a patsy I'm a sittin' duck I'm lost

01:21:05.347 --> 01:21:07.814
Lost?

01:21:07.883 --> 01:21:12.218
I'll tell you what you can do
You can act like a man

01:21:12.287 --> 01:21:14.955
And let me tell you something, smart guy

01:21:15.055 --> 01:21:17.525
You thought you had it all figured out

01:21:17.625 --> 01:21:20.286
Trust Marriage

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:23.955
All your goddamn love, love, love.

01:21:25.032 --> 01:21:29.870
Now, you listen to me I'm gonna
talk to you about the goddamn law

01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:32.029
We serve the law.

01:21:32.105 --> 01:21:34.733
We honor the law.

01:21:34.808 --> 01:21:39.245
And sometimes, Counselor,
we obey the law

01:21:39.313 --> 01:21:43.215
But, Counselor,

01:21:43.283 --> 01:21:46.012
This is not one of those times

01:21:57.063 --> 01:22:00.328
Are you WheezyJoe?

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.662
Which of youse is Smith?

01:22:02.734 --> 01:22:06.831
Well, uh, we're here
representing Mr Smith...

01:22:06.906 --> 01:22:09.174
...on a matter of some delicacy...

01:22:09.274 --> 01:22:12.176
Who's the pigeon?
- The what?

01:22:12.245 --> 01:22:15.414
Who you want me to kill?
- Yes Well, we would like you...

01:22:15.514 --> 01:22:19.847
Mr Smith would like you to neutralize...

01:22:19.919 --> 01:22:23.719
...terminate...
render unto a state of...

01:22:23.789 --> 01:22:26.525
...so that she isn't so much, uh... uh...

01:22:26.625 --> 01:22:29.855
Breathing
- Yes A business associate...

01:22:29.896 --> 01:22:34.665
...by the name of Marylin
Rexroth-Doyle-Massey... Smith... Massey

01:22:34.765 --> 01:22:37.634
Is that one person?

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:41.502
I have some photos here...

01:22:41.573 --> 01:22:45.676
...of Miss Rexroth, and, um, that's
the address that she's staying at

01:22:45.776 --> 01:22:49.114
That is Mr Smith's address...
Massey's... Smith...

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:52.149
It's Mr Smith's address, although
Mr Smith is not directly involved

01:22:52.249 --> 01:22:54.352
Because of an impending
legal matter, we need...

01:22:54.452 --> 01:22:56.420
...this to happen within
a certain time frame...

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.835
On an expedited basis
- You're in a rush

01:22:59.890 --> 01:23:02.525
We're not in a rush Mr Smith is

01:23:10.301 --> 01:23:15.329
Sh... Sh... Sh... She won't...
She won't suffer, will she?

01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.480
Not unless you pay extra

01:23:19.676 --> 01:23:23.077
Oh, I've been workin' on the railroad

01:23:23.146 --> 01:23:26.013
All the livelong day

01:23:26.082 --> 01:23:28.518
I've been workin' on the railroad

01:23:28.618 --> 01:23:31.381
Just to pass the time away

01:23:31.454 --> 01:23:34.912
Can't you hear the whistle blowing

01:23:34.991 --> 01:23:38.585
Rise up so early in the morn Toot-toot.

01:23:40.930 --> 01:23:45.127
Whistle's goin' 'toot-toot'

01:23:49.171 --> 01:23:51.902
What's the matter, Rexie?

01:23:59.348 --> 01:24:01.816
Hello?

01:24:49.062 --> 01:24:51.530
My God...

01:24:51.599 --> 01:24:55.193
What?
- That was Marvin Untermeyer

01:24:55.268 --> 01:24:58.338
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney

01:24:58.438 --> 01:25:00.438
Yes?

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.274
What do you mean, he was?

01:25:02.374 --> 01:25:07.112
Rex had a massive coronary
in the middle of a business meeting

01:25:07.212 --> 01:25:09.212
He's dead

01:25:09.216 --> 01:25:11.585
Well, I'm very sorry to hear that,

01:25:11.685 --> 01:25:14.487
but you two weren't close,
were you?

01:25:14.587 --> 01:25:19.707
Marvin said that Rex's will was
four years old Never redrafted it

01:25:19.793 --> 01:25:23.024
He was stinkin'rich Yes?

01:25:25.532 --> 01:25:27.742
Everything goes to Marylin

01:25:34.405 --> 01:25:36.508
She's not poor She's richer than you

01:25:36.608 --> 01:25:39.578
She is exposed No prenup
She's a sitting duck

01:25:39.678 --> 01:25:41.946
She's a sitting duck Can't
kill her No need Mm-hmm

01:25:42.046 --> 01:25:44.718
No It would be pointless
She's exposed It's pointless

01:25:44.818 --> 01:25:47.253
Exposed Why kill the only woman you've
ever loved when she's the richer party?

01:25:47.353 --> 01:25:49.922
She's rich And I love her
Don't need to kill her

01:25:50.022 --> 01:25:52.022
Ah What? Ah.

01:25:52.023 --> 01:25:54.859
You've reached WheezyJoe
What do you want? Joe.

01:25:54.959 --> 01:25:58.229
Hi, it's Miles Smith...
Mr Smith... calling to say...

01:25:58.329 --> 01:26:00.398
...on behalf of myself,
that it is... No-go...

01:26:00.498 --> 01:26:02.333
...uh, no-go concerning Marylin

01:26:02.433 --> 01:26:06.137
I'm speaking with no knowledge
This is what Mr Smith wants

01:26:06.237 --> 01:26:08.432
This is what I want

01:26:08.506 --> 01:26:11.873
I am Mr Smith Thank you

01:26:13.077 --> 01:26:15.271
That was good...

01:26:15.345 --> 01:26:18.660
You think I'm protected?
- Ehh... You...

01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:20.518
Am I protected?
I think it would hold up...

01:26:20.618 --> 01:26:23.017
Marylin
- Yes, yes Marylin...

01:26:23.086 --> 01:26:25.124
What do we do? What if
he's on his way there?

01:26:25.224 --> 01:26:26.224
Yes Oh.

01:26:26.324 --> 01:26:29.726
If he's on his way there...
- Oh, no. Marylin.

01:26:29.826 --> 01:26:34.490
Get her out and buy some time
Buy some time.

01:26:39.603 --> 01:26:41.371
Hello?

01:26:41.471 --> 01:26:43.608
Marylin, you must
leave the house immediately

01:26:43.708 --> 01:26:45.675
It's imperative that you
leave the house Hello, Miles...

01:26:45.775 --> 01:26:49.246
Hello, dear
- Now, Miles, pending final settlement,

01:26:49.346 --> 01:26:52.114
you know that I'm entitled to use the
house No, no, no. You don't understand.

01:26:52.214 --> 01:26:54.216
It's an emergency.
An emergency.

01:26:54.316 --> 01:26:58.888
What is it? I forgot that I left
the gas main on, which leaks.

01:26:58.988 --> 01:27:02.725
Good gosh That sounds dangerous
- It's a deadly, odorless, colorless,

01:27:02.825 --> 01:27:06.228
'liquid-less' gas that... that attacks
the central nervous system...

01:27:06.328 --> 01:27:09.332
...and causes diarrhea and facial tics.

01:27:09.432 --> 01:27:13.235
Okay All right Well, thanks
for calling, Miles Okay Bye-bye

01:27:13.335 --> 01:27:17.635
I think she bought it

01:27:22.311 --> 01:27:25.507
So, tell me...

01:27:27.283 --> 01:27:29.283
...who sent you?

01:27:31.287 --> 01:27:32.988
Mr Smith

01:27:33.088 --> 01:27:35.088
Is this Mr Smith?

01:27:35.156 --> 01:27:37.156
No

01:27:38.693 --> 01:27:40.693
That's his lawyer

01:27:42.731 --> 01:27:46.460
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll double

01:27:48.703 --> 01:27:52.706
What now? We wait for WheezyJoe
We tell him it's a no-go

01:27:52.806 --> 01:27:55.297
Careful Rottweilers

01:28:02.083 --> 01:28:04.953
Looks like she's gone
Looks like she bought it

01:28:05.053 --> 01:28:08.756
Good stuff There's no one
here Except for the rottweilers

01:28:08.856 --> 01:28:13.053
Sure Rottweilers

01:28:13.125 --> 01:28:15.560
You go that way

01:28:42.455 --> 01:28:44.514
WheezyJoe?

01:29:17.322 --> 01:29:20.883
WheezyJoe,
thank God you're in time

01:29:20.959 --> 01:29:24.362
You're not in time We're in
time Thank God we're in time

01:29:24.462 --> 01:29:30.167
Look, it's a no-go You get it? No one need
be the wiser, so you can just go on home

01:29:30.267 --> 01:29:33.395
Good-bye You know,
thank you so much

01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:36.350
Hear that? Okay?
No, no No, no No, no

01:29:36.373 --> 01:29:40.241
No-go No contract It's off It's...

01:29:40.311 --> 01:29:43.248
Will you explain to the lunkhead
that it's a no-go? No-go It's a no-go

01:29:43.348 --> 01:29:46.917
We'll settle your contract later Look,
you're fired, pal Let it go Walk away...

01:29:47.017 --> 01:29:48.017
Golden parachute

01:29:48.117 --> 01:29:50.187
Don't let the screen door hit
you Does he speak any language?

01:29:50.287 --> 01:29:52.456
Here's what happened,
Mr Carnera We feel that...

01:29:52.556 --> 01:29:55.081
Wait, wait, wait, wait

01:30:11.742 --> 01:30:14.574
Wheezy. Uh...

01:30:28.057 --> 01:30:30.183
Told him it was a no-go

01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:56.876
Gentlemen Freddy...

01:31:00.288 --> 01:31:03.280
Hello, Marylin
- Hello, Miles...

01:31:05.159 --> 01:31:10.174
This is where we first met, remember?
- Of course I remember

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:14.186
It's hard to believe that
when you walk out that...

01:31:14.286 --> 01:31:17.571
...door today, you'll be
walking out of my life forever

01:31:17.671 --> 01:31:19.341
It's not something I wanted either

01:31:19.441 --> 01:31:21.441
But, then, I guess...

01:31:22.743 --> 01:31:25.211
...something inside of me died...

01:31:25.311 --> 01:31:28.848
...when I realized that
you'd hired a goon to kill me

01:31:28.948 --> 01:31:32.486
Wait a minute You hired him to
kill me No Both of you wait a minute...

01:31:32.586 --> 01:31:35.690
Nobody hired anyone to kill anyone
- Hear, hear

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:38.793
Apparently, from what I can gather,
a burglar broke into your house

01:31:38.893 --> 01:31:41.418
Miles's house Whatever.

01:31:41.494 --> 01:31:45.565
A burglar broke in intending
to loot the place, uh, repented,

01:31:45.665 --> 01:31:49.003
became despondent over his
lifestyle and shot himself...

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:53.540
So where does that leave you and me?
- Well, we've outlined a settlement

01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:59.546
We think it's very generous My client
is prepared to consider a reconciliation

01:31:59.646 --> 01:32:02.916
But how could I trust you,
Miles, after all this?

01:32:03.016 --> 01:32:06.920
See, that's exactly right The point is...
You wounded me first, Marylin

01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:10.255
I'm not proud of what I've done,
but God knows, I did trust you once

01:32:10.355 --> 01:32:16.089
If you couldjust...
just give us another chance

01:32:16.161 --> 01:32:18.614
Well, if you'll pardon me
here, but I think my...

01:32:18.714 --> 01:32:21.166
...client is well beyond
the point of considering...

01:32:21.266 --> 01:32:26.791
How could I ever trust you again?
I mean, really trust you, Miles?

01:32:39.617 --> 01:32:43.621
Marylin, there is nothing
in the Massey prenup that says...

01:32:43.721 --> 01:32:47.546
...it can't be executed after the parties wed

01:32:48.726 --> 01:32:53.754
Well, if this, uh, indeed is a Massey prenup,

01:32:53.831 --> 01:32:59.016
and a cursory examination
tends to support that it is, then...

01:33:00.071 --> 01:33:02.961
Oh, my God, Marylin You're exposed

01:33:06.711 --> 01:33:08.711
Marylin

01:33:17.355 --> 01:33:20.085
Counselor. Freddy.

01:33:21.424 --> 01:33:23.728
Freddy. Come on, Freddy.
No fair.

01:33:23.828 --> 01:33:25.920
Freddy.

01:33:30.066 --> 01:33:35.336
Did you hear something? Only the
patter of little lawyers' feet

01:33:40.443 --> 01:33:43.639
Where did you find Howard?

01:33:43.712 --> 01:33:46.876
The actor?
From a TV producer

01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:53.580
I think you know him I gave him an idea
for a new show, so he made me a partner

01:33:58.395 --> 01:34:02.390
I guess that means I'm a partner
I guess it does

01:34:04.465 --> 01:34:07.950
And what exactly is it we're partners in?

01:34:14.876 --> 01:34:17.971
Who gets what and who gets who?

01:34:18.047 --> 01:34:21.983
You'll find out on
