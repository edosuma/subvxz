00:53.319 --> 00:57.322
I believe you have something
of mine, Robert.

00:57.324 --> 01:00.159
It belongs to neither
of us, Bruno.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.394
Humans shouldn't
possess this kind of power.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.102
With that, I could have everything
I've ever wanted for eternity.

01:10.104 --> 01:13.072
I don't want to live in a world where
you can get everything you want.

01:13.074 --> 01:14.406
Give me what's mine.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.647
Sorry, old friend.

01:22.649 --> 01:24.183
This is for your own good.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.339
- Did you get the batteries?
- Sure did.

05:09.699 --> 05:11.678
Are you sure this is gonna work?

05:11.679 --> 05:18.550
Absolutely. Sandy got all the
instructions off the Internet. Right?

05:18.552 --> 05:21.887
I kinda got all of them off the Internet.
I improvised a little.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.955
A homemade time machine
that we found on the Internet.

05:23.957 --> 05:27.426
What could possibly go wrong?

05:27.428 --> 05:32.631
In the miraculous off chance that this
actually works, where should we send him?

05:32.633 --> 05:35.100
What about back
to prehistoric times?

05:35.102 --> 05:35.100
You like dinosaurs, right?

05:35.102 --> 05:41.440
Sure, I like dinosaurs. It doesn't mean I
want to be walking around amongst them.

05:41.442 --> 05:44.776
Come to think of it, I'd like to
be transported back to last week

05:44.778 --> 05:47.112
when I agreed to take part
in this stupid experiment.

05:48.548 --> 05:52.617
Come on, you guys.
We're the adventure club.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.519
This could be
the ultimate adventure.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.123
Okay, here goes.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.025
Wait! Did you change the date?

06:00.027 --> 06:00.025
Oh, no!

06:00.027 --> 06:04.529
If I get eaten by a t-Rex, I'm gonna
be really, really mad at you guys!

06:14.108 --> 06:15.674
Did it work?

06:22.183 --> 06:23.082
Nope.

06:23.083 --> 06:28.587
I guess we can chalk up another
bust for the adventure club.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.655
What a surprise.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.958
I really had high hopes
for this one, guys.

06:35.094 --> 06:37.896
Maybe we should give up on this
whole adventure club thing.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.932
Yeah, maybe we should
try something else.

06:40.934 --> 06:44.736
Come on, you guys.
We can't give up.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.139
There's got to be adventures
out there for us to have.

06:47.141 --> 06:49.608
Really? Like the time you tried
to convince us that there's

06:49.610 --> 06:49.608
a loch ness monster
living in the lake?

06:49.610 --> 06:54.746
Or that there was pirate treasure
buried under the school playground?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.648
I think it's time
to give up the dream.

06:58.451 --> 07:01.052
Plus I'm out of pez,
my favorite.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.088
Worst day ever.

07:04.757 --> 07:08.026
At least i have Penelope.

07:08.028 --> 07:11.630
It's really disturbing that you
call your jalopy Penelope.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.765
She's not a jalopy.
She's a go-kart.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.468
And once I'm finished working
on her, she'll be beautiful.

07:21.507 --> 07:24.075
Hey, you okay?

07:25.445 --> 07:26.878
It's getting late.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.815
I better go home.

07:50.536 --> 07:54.239
I do understand your position, but I
don't know if you understand mine.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.141
Look, if our funding
continues to be cut,

07:56.143 --> 07:58.977
we won't have any money
to bring any new exhibits in,

07:58.979 --> 08:02.547
and it will be impossible for the
science museum to turn a profit.

08:02.549 --> 08:03.982
It's a vicious cycle.

08:05.685 --> 08:07.819
Yes.

08:08.721 --> 08:10.856
Yes, I understand.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.492
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

08:15.761 --> 08:17.262
- Well, that didn't sound good.
- No.

08:19.031 --> 08:21.566
Hey, sweetheart.
Where have you been?

08:21.568 --> 08:23.235
Just hanging out.
Hey, Martin.

08:23.237 --> 08:24.703
Hey, buddy.

08:25.605 --> 08:25.604
Everything okay, mom?

08:25.606 --> 08:30.742
Oh, yeah, just some
science museum stuff.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.010
You ready for some dinner?
Martin made lasagna.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.746
Yeah, and I made it,
not your mom.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.683
What is that supposed to mean?

08:38.684 --> 08:40.619
Nothing, dear.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.686
No, thanks.

08:41.688 --> 08:41.686
Are you sure?

08:41.688 --> 08:46.224
It's not just any lasagna.
It's Mac-and-cheese lasagna.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.759
I'm not hungry.

08:50.296 --> 08:51.997
I'll be right back.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.791
Hey, sweetie.

09:22.628 --> 09:24.329
Are you okay?

09:29.635 --> 09:31.336
Can I see?

09:34.006 --> 09:37.943
Aw. I haven't seen
that in a long time.

09:40.313 --> 09:41.880
Mom...

09:41.882 --> 09:46.184
Do you think grandpa really
went on all those adventures?

09:47.186 --> 09:49.588
Oh, yeah.

09:49.590 --> 09:53.892
He was an archaeologist, sweetheart.
He traveled all over the world.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.230
I miss how he'd give me a wet
Willy every time I'd see him.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.834
You used to hate
those wet willies.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.805
I miss them now.

10:08.342 --> 10:09.342
I know.

10:13.679 --> 10:14.999
You were his favorite.

10:18.618 --> 10:23.755
He used to always say that one of
his most favorite days, ever...

10:24.690 --> 10:26.358
Was the day that you were born.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.695
Do you think I could
ever be like him?

10:30.697 --> 10:34.633
Oh, Ricky,
you already are like him.

10:35.801 --> 10:39.104
I mean, like, going on
adventures and stuff.

10:41.273 --> 10:44.409
Do you remember what granddad
used to always say...

10:44.411 --> 10:47.946
That the key to adventure
is always right in front of you.

10:57.423 --> 11:00.158
Is the science museum
going to close down?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.727
I don't know...

11:02.729 --> 11:02.727
But it doesn't look good.

11:02.729 --> 11:08.433
We need to come up with a lot of
money before the end of the month.

11:08.435 --> 11:13.004
Grandpa would be sad to hear that.
He was the founder of that place.

11:15.207 --> 11:16.875
Yes, he was.

11:16.877 --> 11:21.046
But you know what?
I don't want you to worry...

11:21.048 --> 11:24.282
Because I have a town hall
meeting this week,

11:24.284 --> 11:29.988
and I'm gonna do my very best to convince
the municipality to do what's right.

11:31.357 --> 11:35.126
So, I need to you to say a wish
for your dear old mama, okay?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.828
'Cause I'm gonna need it.

11:38.931 --> 11:40.765
It's time for you
to go to bed now.

11:42.001 --> 11:44.269
I want you to come
brush your teeth, okay?

11:47.940 --> 11:49.307
Baby.

11:51.844 --> 11:53.411
I'm proud of you.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.614
The key...

14:44.617 --> 14:47.352
The key to adventure
is right in front of me.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.629
Who's there?

15:36.101 --> 15:38.436
Ricky, you scared me.
I thought you were a burglar.

15:39.305 --> 15:40.638
What are you doing up here?

15:41.707 --> 15:45.176
Uh, nothing.
Just couldn't sleep.

15:48.480 --> 15:49.681
Okay.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.552
Well... good night.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.516
Clubhouse meeting,
first thing tomorrow.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.353
Roger.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.088
Copy that.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.768
I'm telling you, guys,
this is it.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.370
This is the one we've
been waiting for.

16:45.372 --> 16:45.370
Like we haven't
heard that before.

16:45.372 --> 16:50.308
- No, this time it's different.
- Every time you say it's different.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.743
But this time it really is.

16:51.745 --> 16:53.311
You say that every time, too.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.615
I'm sorry, Ricky, but...

16:57.617 --> 17:01.652
I'm gonna have to take bill's side
on this one. Adventure club rules.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.521
You have to have a majority.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.323
Just hear me out.

17:05.325 --> 17:09.160
I found this hidden
in my grandpa's old desk.

17:09.162 --> 17:12.730
Why would he go through the trouble of hiding
this if it wasn't something really special?

17:13.598 --> 17:15.333
And I'm the one who found it.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.403
Don't you see?

17:18.405 --> 17:20.671
It's like he left it for me.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.107
I've got a good feeling
about this one, guys.

17:23.108 --> 17:26.077
It's not that we don't
want to believe you, but...

17:26.079 --> 17:28.046
We don't believe you.

17:29.748 --> 17:32.150
Please, guys...

17:32.152 --> 17:36.220
Just give me this one,
at least for this one last time.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.324
And if this turns
out to be a bust...

17:41.326 --> 17:42.593
I promise...

17:44.296 --> 17:45.663
I'll let it go...

17:47.766 --> 17:49.200
Forever.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.337
Fine.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.740
I wanna see the map.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.141
You guys are the best.

18:07.786 --> 18:10.421
Well, this is a map, all right.

18:10.423 --> 18:14.125
But it's not of streets.

18:14.127 --> 18:17.428
It looks like some kind of old-fashioned
blueprints for a building.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.363
How do we find out
what building this is from?

18:22.301 --> 18:25.136
Hey, look. The architect's
name is written here.

18:25.138 --> 18:28.773
Shayne putzlocher?
That's a mouthful.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.341
I've got an idea.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.655
This is way
too much like school.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.757
Take a seat.
I'll be right back.

19:01.673 --> 19:05.877
Putzlocher... putzlocher...

19:07.446 --> 19:10.214
Putzlocher... ah, putzlocher.

19:24.563 --> 19:27.298
Shayne putzlocher, architect.

19:27.300 --> 19:33.337
Uh, "by 1964, the power corporation
purchased the powerhouse..."

19:33.339 --> 19:33.337
uh... la, la, la...

19:33.339 --> 19:39.477
Ah. "The legacy of the powerhouse
building was preserved as..."

19:39.479 --> 19:39.477
"the science museum!"

19:39.479 --> 19:43.648
Our science museum,
right here in town.

19:43.650 --> 19:47.885
Of course. My grandpa was the key
founder of the science museum.

19:47.887 --> 19:53.224
That probably means whatever this
key unlocks is in that building.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.726
And these blueprints
are for the science museum.

20:37.236 --> 20:41.539
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Whoa, easy there, kids.

20:41.541 --> 20:45.243
Did you not see the sign
that says, "no run-ning".

20:45.245 --> 20:47.411
Where do you think you are,
an amusement park?

20:47.413 --> 20:50.314
Don't answer that, son.
That's a rhetorical question.

20:50.316 --> 20:53.284
You are in a museum of science,

20:53.286 --> 20:55.820
a hallowed institution
for learned people.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.955
You have to respect
this establishment.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.958
Wow. That's a lot of
equipment you got there.

21:03.495 --> 21:04.829
I'm in security, son.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.897
You always gotta be prepared.

21:06.899 --> 21:09.000
- You're insecure?
- What?

21:09.901 --> 21:12.336
- No.
- Curtis...

21:12.338 --> 21:14.839
It's me, Ricky.
You remember?

21:15.841 --> 21:17.575
My mom works here.

21:18.543 --> 21:20.878
Oh, I see.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.813
You're one of those.

21:22.815 --> 21:22.813
One of...

21:22.815 --> 21:28.552
One of those kids who thinks
they get a free pass in life.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.388
That's your generation.

21:30.390 --> 21:34.558
My generation had to grow up
way faster than yours.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.928
You don't know what it's like
to have to pay your dues.

21:37.930 --> 21:41.532
Speaking of, you gotta pay
the $7.50 admission charge.

21:41.534 --> 21:45.903
Ricky! Hey, kids,
what a nice surprise.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.806
Yeah, we thought we'd come by and
check out some of the new exhibits.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.941
Well, I'm very happy
to hear that.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.410
Curtis, you can
let them through.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.512
- Certainly, ma'am.
- Come on.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.620
The youth of today.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.427
What's that?

22:09.429 --> 22:11.696
That is a gyrosphere.

22:11.698 --> 22:15.099
It's a tool that astronauts use
to prepare for space flight.

22:15.101 --> 22:15.099
Cool.

22:15.101 --> 22:19.503
Yeah, you may think so, but you will
not catch me anywhere near that thing.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.372
Just looking at it throws me
off my equilibrium.

22:21.374 --> 22:24.575
My mom hates any kind
of amusement park ride.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.944
Remember what happened when
we were at wonderland,

22:26.946 --> 22:29.580
and I convinced you to go
on the space coaster with me?

22:29.582 --> 22:31.022
Sweetheart, we don't
talk about that.

22:31.750 --> 22:32.817
Barf-o-rama.

22:32.819 --> 22:32.817
- I heard that.
- Ew.

22:32.819 --> 22:36.587
All right, listen, I've got to get
back to work. You guys have fun, okay?

22:36.589 --> 22:37.988
- Okay.
- I'm so glad you're here.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.624
- Bye, mom.
- Bye, sweetie, enjoy.

22:40.626 --> 22:43.828
Okay, let's put these blueprints
to use and see what we can find.

22:51.970 --> 22:54.605
Um, so what are we looking for?

22:54.607 --> 22:55.940
There has to be something.

22:56.842 --> 22:59.744
Come on, grandpa. What is it?

23:04.649 --> 23:06.550
What's this over here?

23:06.552 --> 23:09.887
A room. Uh,
according to this, it's...

23:11.089 --> 23:13.691
Below us on the main level.

23:13.693 --> 23:16.560
I've been here
a thousand times...

23:16.562 --> 23:17.828
And there's no room there.

23:30.041 --> 23:32.810
You're right.
There's no room here.

23:32.812 --> 23:36.480
These blueprints show the exact
layout of this entire building,

23:36.482 --> 23:40.418
and according to this, there
should be a room right here.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.119
Why would a room be walled off?

23:43.555 --> 23:45.423
Because it's a secret room.

23:46.091 --> 23:46.090
It all makes sense.

23:46.092 --> 23:50.861
Where else would you keep a hidden
treasure but in a secret room?

23:50.863 --> 23:53.030
How do we get in there?

23:53.032 --> 23:55.433
I don't know.

23:55.435 --> 23:57.435
We can't just do it
in the middle of the day.

23:57.437 --> 23:57.435
What are you saying?
We break in?

23:57.437 --> 24:04.041
Because that's illegal, and I don't know
about you guys, but I can't go to jail.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.643
For starters,
I'm claustrophobic,

24:05.645 --> 24:08.612
and I look terrible in orange.

24:08.614 --> 24:12.082
We don't need to break in.
Ricky's mom works here.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.785
He can just borrow
the security key.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.188
I'm not a lawyer, but this
distinctly sounds like something

24:17.190 --> 24:19.790
that would land us in deep
trouble if we get caught.

24:21.159 --> 24:22.793
Then we don't get caught.

24:24.596 --> 24:26.530
The museum closes at 7:00.

24:26.532 --> 24:28.232
Let's meet here
just before 8:00 P.M.

24:28.234 --> 24:29.567
Done.

24:32.904 --> 24:35.506
Fine.

24:35.508 --> 24:39.577
All right, boys. I did the cooking
tonight, so get ready to enjoy.

24:43.715 --> 24:44.782
What'd you make, mom?

24:44.784 --> 24:46.016
Paella.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.552
I think.

24:48.554 --> 24:48.552
Oh.

24:48.554 --> 24:52.156
You know, sweetie, it was really
nice to see you guys today.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.024
You haven't been
coming down lately.

24:54.026 --> 24:56.627
We thought we'd just
pass by for a visit.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.062
I was surprised
you had the energy.

24:59.965 --> 25:01.899
Why?

25:01.901 --> 25:01.899
No reason.

25:01.901 --> 25:05.236
Okay, you know what?
Don't gang up on me.

25:07.272 --> 25:08.706
It's okay. You can tell her.

25:08.708 --> 25:08.706
Tell me what?

25:08.708 --> 25:14.812
I woke up in the middle of the night, and I
found this guy rummaging around the den.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.547
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:16.549 --> 25:18.649
And what were you
doing up there?

25:18.651 --> 25:21.752
I was just looking through
some of grandpa's old things.

25:21.754 --> 25:24.688
- Did you find anything cool?
- Yeah, I did.

25:24.690 --> 25:27.725
He's convinced that his granddad
wasn't just an archaeologist,

25:27.727 --> 25:31.028
but an incredible explorer
that found magical artifacts.

25:31.030 --> 25:34.164
- Like Dr. Jones.
- Exactly like Dr. Jones.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.000
Grandpa is not Dr. Jones.

25:36.002 --> 25:36.000
He was too.

25:36.002 --> 25:40.604
I found something last night of his
that will prove everyone wrong.

25:40.606 --> 25:43.674
Well, you are definitely your
granddad's grandson, that's for sure.

25:44.676 --> 25:46.810
So what'd you find?

25:46.812 --> 25:49.980
I don't know yet,
but something big.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.849
I can feel it.

25:51.851 --> 25:54.084
All right, Mr. tall teller
of tales, that's enough.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.554
I want to enjoy
this delicious dinner.

25:56.556 --> 25:58.088
Dig in.

26:02.794 --> 26:05.296
- I'll order pizza.
- Yeah.

26:10.871 --> 26:11.770
Okay.

26:11.771 --> 26:16.006
I guess you should stick
to the cooking from now on.

26:16.008 --> 26:18.042
Don't beat yourself up.
Paella is a tough one.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.977
- It is.
- Start with something simpler.

26:20.845 --> 26:20.844
Like toast?

26:20.846 --> 26:26.283
Your toast usually involves the fire
alarm, so yeah, maybe you were right.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.786
Maybe I should stick
to the cooking from now on.

26:29.721 --> 26:29.720
You're terrible.

26:29.722 --> 26:35.192
No, I'm serious. I'm happy to be the
domestic one. You're the business woman.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.227
For the moment.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.730
I have no doubt that
you are going to be the hottest

26:39.732 --> 26:42.766
real estate agent
around in no time at all.

26:42.768 --> 26:44.268
Well, let's hope so.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.303
It's hard to adjust
to a new town.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.872
Well, you're not on the mean
streets of Cleveland anymore.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.243
And we prairie folk, we take
a while to warm up to people.

26:53.880 --> 26:54.779
Really?

26:54.780 --> 26:59.183
'Cause I seem to recall
winning you over pretty quickly.

26:59.185 --> 27:01.218
Well, there's always
an exception to the rule.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.721
Lucky for me.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.790
He really likes you.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.927
Who, Ricky?
He's a great kid.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.762
He is.

27:11.764 --> 27:13.364
And you're a great guy.

27:15.667 --> 27:17.167
And this feels really nice.

27:18.036 --> 27:19.236
What?

27:20.872 --> 27:22.106
Like we're a family.

27:35.503 --> 27:37.122
I feel like some ice cream.

27:37.123 --> 27:40.691
Do you want some ice cream?
Let's have some ice cream.

27:40.693 --> 27:41.892
Sure.

27:45.196 --> 27:47.097
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.333
- I'm gonna get some ice cream.
- Cool.

27:57.342 --> 28:01.278
You know, it looks like we're out
of ice cream. I'll pick some up!

28:01.280 --> 28:03.013
Really? I could
have sworn there was...

28:03.915 --> 28:05.716
Martin?

28:05.718 --> 28:06.917
Martin!

28:33.111 --> 28:36.280
All the world's a stage...

28:36.282 --> 28:39.249
And all the men and women
play their parts.

28:39.251 --> 28:42.820
There are exits.
There are entrances...

28:42.822 --> 28:47.925
And one man in his
time plays many parts.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.730
Hi.

28:52.732 --> 28:56.500
You know, when I ran
the drama club at the state pen,

28:56.502 --> 29:00.437
I fell in love with
the craft of acting.

29:00.439 --> 29:00.437
I did. I just...
I went nuts for it.

29:00.439 --> 29:08.439
When an actor really gets into his part,
it is... it just, it gave me goosebumps.

29:09.749 --> 29:13.117
Kinda like what I'm getting from
you, right now, watching you.

29:14.285 --> 29:15.853
But you went to like
a whole other level.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.856
You... you've gone
method, my friend.

29:20.091 --> 29:22.326
What are you
talking about, Langley?

29:22.328 --> 29:25.362
You're really falling
for her, aren't you?

29:25.364 --> 29:27.965
What's her name?
That... Jane.

29:29.234 --> 29:32.936
I have not fallen for her.

29:32.938 --> 29:36.540
I hope not 'cause that would really
endanger our mission, wouldn't it?

29:37.071 --> 29:38.510
What are you doing here?

29:38.511 --> 29:38.509
I didn't even know
you were out of prison yet.

29:38.511 --> 29:46.216
Yeah, I know. I'm not supposed to
be, but somehow I found a way.

29:47.385 --> 29:47.384
I had to check up on you.

29:47.386 --> 29:52.923
I had to make sure that you were still
following through with our deal.

29:55.360 --> 29:58.061
Of course I'm following
through with our deal!

29:58.063 --> 30:00.998
You do not get snippy with me!

30:02.400 --> 30:04.201
Remember, I took the fall.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.903
- I went to prison.

30:05.905 --> 30:09.473
You got to go free.
Please. You owe me.

30:09.475 --> 30:13.076
- I did...
- You owe me. You owe me.

30:14.579 --> 30:16.046
And I will rat on you.

30:20.952 --> 30:22.886
You're right. I'm sorry.

30:29.460 --> 30:32.930
So... what news?

30:34.499 --> 30:36.967
The kid found something,

30:36.969 --> 30:38.402
said it belonged
to his grandfather.

30:39.304 --> 30:40.304
His grandfather?

30:41.439 --> 30:43.307
I'll find out more information.

30:43.309 --> 30:49.513
Well, good. You better, because
that thing is priceless. Remember?

30:49.515 --> 30:53.250
My father spent his whole life trying
to get it back, and he died in squalor,

30:53.252 --> 30:57.087
begging for assistance from anyone.
I'm not goin' like that.

31:00.158 --> 31:01.358
I'm on it.

31:04.028 --> 31:07.231
I hope so,
'cause I'd hate to recast you.

31:08.433 --> 31:08.432
So, um, I wanna
take it back again.

31:08.434 --> 31:15.172
Not from the top, though, from that
last line, your last line. "I'm on it."

31:15.174 --> 31:18.208
'Cause I didn't really
believe it, and I wanna feel it.

31:19.510 --> 31:20.911
Will you try it again for me?

31:24.582 --> 31:27.217
I'm on it.

31:27.219 --> 31:27.217
Okay, I like underplay too, but that
was like really throwin' it away.

31:27.219 --> 31:33.323
How about just like something with a
little more feeling, a little more bang.

31:33.325 --> 31:35.225
I'm on it!

31:35.227 --> 31:35.225
We're gonna have old ladies
with hearing aids.

31:35.227 --> 31:40.097
They're not gonna be able to hear you as they
come in. They'll say, "what's he saying?"

31:40.099 --> 31:40.097
- "I don't know."
- I'm on it!

31:40.099 --> 31:43.567
Guess what, we got a back row.
They're not gonna hear a thing.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.570
I'm on it!

31:46.572 --> 31:50.374
Don't you feel that?
That is crazy.

31:50.376 --> 31:51.541
Goosebumps.

31:55.613 --> 31:57.014
And scene.

32:03.554 --> 32:05.055
You got the key, right?

32:05.057 --> 32:06.990
Yep.

32:06.992 --> 32:08.225
Let's do this.

32:15.234 --> 32:16.600
It's not working.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.335
Maybe it's the other way around.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.407
Let me see it.

32:25.576 --> 32:27.110
This is a yoga membership card.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.478
It is?

32:28.480 --> 32:30.981
Dude, you've gotta
be kidding me!

32:30.983 --> 32:33.483
They both look very similar.
I was in a rush.

32:33.485 --> 32:37.020
You had one job!

32:37.022 --> 32:38.422
Well, I guess we have
to go home now.

32:38.424 --> 32:40.490
- Not yet.
- What?

32:43.296 --> 32:44.195
What's that?

32:44.196 --> 32:48.365
It's a key code descrambler
I've been working on.

32:48.367 --> 32:51.034
Found the instructions online.

32:51.036 --> 32:53.603
Thought it might come in handy when we're
late for school, and they lock us out.

32:53.605 --> 32:56.006
- Does it work?
- I don't know.

33:04.015 --> 33:05.482
Right this way, gentlemen.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.085
Nice save, Sandy.

33:20.465 --> 33:23.567
Curtis goes on his rounds
at the top of every hour.

33:23.569 --> 33:26.303
Which is right...

33:28.339 --> 33:29.606
Now.

33:42.653 --> 33:45.389
We have to be in
and out in 30 minutes.

34:41.344 --> 34:42.779
Psst.

35:11.642 --> 35:13.743
So, how do we open it?

35:13.745 --> 35:15.712
I've got an idea.

35:15.714 --> 35:20.484
Open sesame!

35:20.486 --> 35:23.787
What? Sometimes it's the most
obvious thing that works.

35:23.789 --> 35:27.891
Well, there's got to be a lever,
or a switch, or something.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.493
Well, at least we tried, right?

35:29.495 --> 35:30.794
Let's go home.

35:37.201 --> 35:39.302
There's definitely
something behind here.

35:40.705 --> 35:43.273
Huh. That's pretty cool.

35:43.275 --> 35:44.841
You're like royalty around here.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.782
Key.

35:52.784 --> 35:55.252
"The key to adventure
is right in front of you."

36:55.479 --> 36:56.947
We're not going in there...

36:58.316 --> 36:59.616
Are we?

37:01.452 --> 37:03.887
This is the point of no return.

37:03.889 --> 37:06.489
Well, then I guess
we'd better get going.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.461
And how is this a good idea?

37:22.006 --> 37:23.873
What is this thing?

37:25.543 --> 37:26.977
I don't know.

37:46.864 --> 37:48.765
I think it's an elevator.

37:55.506 --> 37:56.606
Where are we going?

37:56.608 --> 37:57.874
I don't know.

38:17.328 --> 38:19.329
This must be my
grandpa's clubhouse.

38:19.331 --> 38:21.364
Just like the one we have.

38:58.502 --> 38:59.836
Do you know the combination?

38:59.838 --> 39:04.007
It's gotta be a significant
number for your grandfather.

39:04.875 --> 39:06.676
Do you know his birthday?

39:08.079 --> 39:09.813
It's may 21st...

39:11.082 --> 39:12.716
But I don't know the year.

39:22.526 --> 39:23.693
What was it?

39:25.496 --> 39:28.932
09, 29, 05...

39:30.568 --> 39:32.001
My birthday.

39:45.983 --> 39:47.550
It's just a wooden box.

39:48.486 --> 39:51.554
That's it? A wooden box?

39:51.556 --> 39:53.490
That's why we broke
the law this evening?

40:07.505 --> 40:09.839
"True wishes are granted
from within."

40:42.706 --> 40:44.507
What do you think it is?

40:46.644 --> 40:47.944
I don't know.

40:51.215 --> 40:53.216
We better get going.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.456
Stealing?

40:59.458 --> 41:01.057
We're stealing now?

41:01.059 --> 41:03.126
Oh, great, another crime.

41:45.669 --> 41:47.003
Hmm.

42:50.569 --> 42:52.168
We're clear.

42:52.170 --> 42:54.003
That was close.

42:54.981 --> 42:56.840
There's got to be more to this.

42:56.841 --> 43:02.946
Well, it has to be something important. Otherwise
it wouldn't have been hidden away like that.

43:05.649 --> 43:06.883
And this note.

43:07.885 --> 43:09.085
What does it mean?

43:10.054 --> 43:11.187
I don't know...

43:12.189 --> 43:13.623
But I know who might.

43:51.295 --> 43:53.129
Do you think he's even here?

43:53.131 --> 43:55.365
Of course he's here.
He's always here.

43:55.367 --> 43:56.799
Where else would he be?

44:11.882 --> 44:13.216
Cool.

44:18.355 --> 44:20.657
Ozzie, you in here?

44:20.893 --> 44:21.792
Hello?

44:21.793 --> 44:28.831
Well. Well, well, well, well,
well, well. Well. Well. Well.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.299
It's the adventure club
in the flesh.

44:30.301 --> 44:32.368
Bam.

44:33.838 --> 44:35.371
Zing.

44:35.373 --> 44:36.939
Adventure club!

44:36.941 --> 44:39.976
So, good to see you guys.

44:39.978 --> 44:43.379
To what do I owe the honor of
this little visit? Can I guess?

44:43.381 --> 44:45.415
You want to get a gift.

44:45.417 --> 44:48.851
You need the perfect present
for the perfect person

44:48.853 --> 44:51.954
who has perfectly everything
from this perfect store.

44:51.956 --> 44:53.423
It is the perfect store.

44:54.324 --> 44:55.992
This is our favorite shop.

44:55.994 --> 44:58.027
I know.
You're my favorites.

44:58.029 --> 45:01.931
My best customers. I mean,
people today, kids... kids!

45:01.933 --> 45:04.867
They're so invested
in those video games.

45:04.869 --> 45:08.037
They don't appreciate old-fashioned
knickknacks like I got here.

45:08.039 --> 45:10.373
And smart phones,
don't get me started.

45:10.375 --> 45:13.342
Don't. Please don't. My heart, I can't.
Dumb phones.

45:13.344 --> 45:15.712
Dumb phones. They should
be called dummy phonies.

45:15.714 --> 45:15.712
- Ozzie...
- Yeah.

45:15.714 --> 45:19.115
- We need your help.
- Of course you do.

45:19.117 --> 45:20.983
I'm all ear. Fire away.

45:20.985 --> 45:22.952
What do you know about boxes?

45:22.954 --> 45:25.221
What do I know about boxes?

45:25.223 --> 45:27.023
Like what, like a toy
box, like a shoe box,

45:27.025 --> 45:29.225
like a tack box, like a toolbox,
like a Jack-in-the-box,

45:29.227 --> 45:32.895
like i-could-go-on-forever-box box?
I need more specifics.

45:32.897 --> 45:37.200
What about an ancient box that
was locked away in a safe...

45:38.836 --> 45:40.002
With this note?

45:41.004 --> 45:42.739
That looks really old, Ricky.

45:44.274 --> 45:46.042
Where did you get
that parchment?

45:47.111 --> 45:48.277
Ricky?

45:59.123 --> 46:02.091
Huh! You know what?

46:02.093 --> 46:04.894
This could be
pertaining to a wish box.

46:04.896 --> 46:07.230
- A wish box?
- Oh, yeah.

46:07.232 --> 46:12.201
Bill, they are extremely,
extremely rare.

46:12.203 --> 46:13.402
What is it?

46:13.404 --> 46:15.805
Follow me, kids.

46:20.277 --> 46:24.080
Wish boxes,
wish boxes, wish boxes.

46:24.082 --> 46:24.080
I mean, kids, you know what?

46:24.082 --> 46:32.082
I recall that they were magical devices
first used by sumerian fortune tellers

46:32.223 --> 46:32.221
in ancient mesopotamia.

46:32.223 --> 46:37.293
And I know you kids know that's where the
cradle of civilization started, right?

46:37.295 --> 46:41.564
That's where the term "genie
in the bottle" originated.

46:43.433 --> 46:44.834
Found it.

46:49.106 --> 46:50.339
Come on, ozzie, over here.

46:50.341 --> 46:52.041
Okay, table of contents.

46:53.010 --> 46:59.348
Oh, my gosh, 143, 143, 143, 143.

46:59.350 --> 47:01.250
Hang on a minute.

47:03.020 --> 47:04.187
Okay, hang on.

47:05.222 --> 47:08.891
Ready? Here it is.

47:08.893 --> 47:13.196
"In ancient times, magic wish boxes were
believed to Grant wishes to whomever

47:13.198 --> 47:17.500
"was fortunate enough to find
it and lay hands upon it.

47:17.502 --> 47:22.271
"Once you had touched the wish
box, you were given three wishes.

47:22.273 --> 47:25.074
"These wishes were allowed by simply
writing it onto a piece of paper

47:25.076 --> 47:30.046
"and dropping it into the box. Any
wish, no matter how outlandish.

47:30.048 --> 47:34.250
The only catch is wishes will only
be granted to the pure of heart."

47:34.252 --> 47:37.386
That's a bummer. I can't imagine too many
wishes being granted if that's true.

47:38.388 --> 47:39.956
Right?

47:47.064 --> 47:52.935
"During the time in which a person
or persons are owed their wishes,

47:52.937 --> 47:56.239
"another party cannot use the
wish box unless the possessor

47:56.241 --> 48:00.042
wishes the box
to be transferred."

48:00.044 --> 48:04.113
Oh, wow. Even in ancient
times, they had legalese.

48:04.115 --> 48:07.984
Isn't history just
so amazing, you guys?

48:09.553 --> 48:14.423
Okay, why? What? Why? What is the
meaning of the interest in this matter?

48:15.359 --> 48:16.926
No reason, really.

48:18.495 --> 48:20.129
Just idle curiosity.

48:21.531 --> 48:22.965
Hmm.

48:24.134 --> 48:25.268
Well...

48:26.336 --> 48:27.536
You know what?

48:29.406 --> 48:35.978
If I ever found something
that possessed the power

48:35.980 --> 48:39.282
of being able to Grant
three wishes,

48:39.284 --> 48:43.953
I'm pretty certain I'd put that
box back to where I found it,

48:43.955 --> 48:48.124
and I would turn around and run
or bike away as fast as I could.

48:48.126 --> 48:49.625
But, why?

48:52.029 --> 48:55.665
Because, Billy...
They're so powerful.

48:57.334 --> 49:02.438
Wish boxes... are so powerful.

49:02.440 --> 49:05.474
I've read about it.
I know about this.

49:05.476 --> 49:11.013
They possess... they've turned
people's minds into crazy,

49:11.015 --> 49:13.683
crazy, crazy greed,

49:13.685 --> 49:16.686
and greed, and want, and want.

49:16.688 --> 49:21.357
Oh, and there are people out there that will
stop at nothing to get their hands on one.

49:24.962 --> 49:26.262
Thanks, ozzie.

49:29.266 --> 49:30.599
Peace, kids.

49:35.205 --> 49:36.639
A magical wish box?

49:36.641 --> 49:38.140
A magical what?

49:39.710 --> 49:39.709
It's none of your business.

49:39.711 --> 49:42.645
Well, I'm gonna
make it my business.

49:43.513 --> 49:46.248
Seth, scram.

49:46.250 --> 49:50.252
Hey, chill out, ozzie. I was just
coming by to pick up some old comics.

49:50.254 --> 49:53.556
Well, not until you pay for the
ones you "picked up" before.

49:53.558 --> 49:56.025
We'll continue
this another time.

49:59.162 --> 50:03.165
Hey, my three adventure clubbers,
remember everything I said.

50:03.302 --> 50:04.201
Ride safe.

50:04.202 --> 50:06.736
- Thanks, ozzie.
- Okay.

50:16.114 --> 50:18.481
Well, I guess we should meet up
tomorrow night to get the wish box

50:18.483 --> 50:20.282
back into the science museum.

50:21.151 --> 50:22.451
Sounds good.

50:28.525 --> 50:30.693
Wait.
Wait, you guys.

50:32.329 --> 50:33.696
We can't just give up now.

50:34.598 --> 50:37.600
What? What about
what ozzie said?

50:37.602 --> 50:43.139
Ozzie is a grownup. He's being overly
cautious. You know how adults can get.

50:43.141 --> 50:45.708
I don't know, dude.
I don't want to get in trouble.

50:45.710 --> 50:45.708
Me neither.

50:45.710 --> 50:53.282
But, that's the risk that every great
adventurer takes, and that's who we are.

50:53.284 --> 50:56.218
We're not great adventurers.
We're just kids.

50:56.220 --> 50:56.218
Do you know what happens
if we give up now?

50:56.220 --> 51:04.220
We become just like everybody else out
there, living boring, normal lives.

51:05.796 --> 51:08.197
One day we'll probably
end up like that.

51:09.833 --> 51:12.501
But let's not give in just yet.

51:12.503 --> 51:16.572
Right now, this is our one
chance to be different.

51:16.574 --> 51:18.641
We could do
something great with it.

51:19.643 --> 51:21.444
Like save the science museum.

51:22.512 --> 51:24.413
We grew up going to that
place our whole lives.

51:25.682 --> 51:27.750
It's gave us so much.

51:27.752 --> 51:30.419
This is an opportunity
to give something back.

51:34.791 --> 51:38.260
Besides, aren't you curious?

51:43.834 --> 51:47.870
So, three wishes are granted
to whoever discovers the box.

51:47.872 --> 51:49.405
But we all found it.

51:49.407 --> 51:51.540
And touched it at the same time.

51:51.542 --> 51:55.744
That means we only have three
wishes between us, one each.

51:55.746 --> 51:55.744
So, we shouldn't waste one.

51:55.746 --> 52:00.649
I agree. But we need to know if
this thing actually works, right?

52:00.651 --> 52:00.649
I don't mind using up mine.

52:00.651 --> 52:05.221
You know me, always willing
to take one for the team.

52:05.223 --> 52:07.790
Okay. What are you
gonna wish for?

52:07.792 --> 52:13.329
Something realistic, not too crazy.
You know, a starter wish.

52:17.901 --> 52:19.735
I've got it!

52:19.737 --> 52:22.505
A lifetime supply of pez.

52:22.507 --> 52:26.442
You know, for a guy who can come up
with some pretty terrible ideas...

52:28.445 --> 52:30.846
Every now and then, you come
up with a brilliant one.

52:47.330 --> 52:50.266
Okay, here it goes.

53:12.789 --> 53:13.956
It didn't work.

53:15.525 --> 53:18.427
Give it a moment.
Maybe it takes some time.

53:25.602 --> 53:26.702
Anything?

53:28.205 --> 53:29.405
Nothing yet.

53:30.907 --> 53:32.374
Anything yet?

53:34.544 --> 53:35.711
Nothing.

53:43.353 --> 53:44.620
How about now?

53:47.624 --> 53:50.659
Still nothing. What a rip-off.

53:50.661 --> 53:50.659
Doesn't make sense.

53:50.661 --> 53:54.964
Why would my grandpa hide
something away that doesn't work?

53:57.767 --> 54:00.436
Maybe there's an expiry
date or something.

54:01.471 --> 54:03.839
I gotta get home.
I'm late for dinner.

54:12.549 --> 54:14.717
Um, Ricky.

54:14.719 --> 54:16.518
Yeah, go for Ricky.

54:16.520 --> 54:19.521
Uh, I think it worked!

54:19.523 --> 54:24.360
Ha! Oh, pez, pez for life! Pez!

54:24.362 --> 54:26.795
Pez! Oh, I love it!
I love it! I love it!

54:30.000 --> 54:32.568
- Hey, don't you want breakfast?
- No, thanks. Gotta go.

54:32.570 --> 54:35.537
Oh, Ricky. Ricky!

54:35.539 --> 54:40.643
Ricky. Ricky. Ricky, wait!

54:40.645 --> 54:46.382
Listen, sweetheart, I am giving my speech to the
municipality tonight for the science museum,

54:46.384 --> 54:49.585
and it would really mean so much
to me if you were there, okay?

54:50.487 --> 54:51.720
Sure.

54:55.392 --> 54:56.692
Slow down!

55:20.750 --> 55:22.584
Can you believe it?

55:22.586 --> 55:22.584
Nope.

55:22.586 --> 55:24.987
What did you do with all of it?

55:24.989 --> 55:24.987
I ate a lot of it.

55:24.989 --> 55:29.692
It was good. The rest I hid
in my closet and under my bed.

55:29.694 --> 55:32.828
I figured if my parents ask, I'll tell
them that I entered a contest and won.

55:32.830 --> 55:34.730
Do you guys realize
what this means?

55:34.732 --> 55:37.066
Yeah, pez for life!

55:37.068 --> 55:39.468
It means the wish box works.

55:39.470 --> 55:41.437
We meet again, dorkuses.

55:41.439 --> 55:44.006
That's not the plural
of dorkus. It's dorki.

55:44.008 --> 55:48.677
Shut up, brainy. I guess your pal ozzie
isn't here to save you this time. It's on.

55:49.546 --> 55:51.113
Sorry, I don't fight girls.

55:51.115 --> 55:52.648
How unfortunate.

55:52.650 --> 55:52.648
Why are you doing this, Seth?

55:52.650 --> 55:56.819
Because I'm sick of you science
geeks and your dumb adventure club.

55:56.821 --> 55:59.722
- We never invited you to
be a part of it. -Exactly.

55:59.724 --> 56:02.057
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

56:03.760 --> 56:05.728
- Martin.
- Oh.

56:06.629 --> 56:08.997
Hi. You startled me.

56:08.999 --> 56:10.532
What are you doing in here?

56:12.969 --> 56:16.405
I was just looking
for my laptop.

56:16.407 --> 56:19.141
Yeah, I lent it to Ricky, and I thought
he might have left it in here.

56:19.143 --> 56:21.110
Oh, he probably left it
in his room. I can check.

56:21.112 --> 56:24.380
No, no! No.
That's fine. I can do that.

56:25.115 --> 56:26.982
Thanks, sweetie.

56:26.984 --> 56:28.984
No problem.

56:28.986 --> 56:31.553
- See ya.
- Yeah.

56:42.132 --> 56:45.401
I think this has just been one
big, unfortunate misunderstanding.

56:45.403 --> 56:48.871
Why don't we take this
opportunity to start fresh?

56:48.873 --> 56:51.573
Can I offer you a
complimentary package of pez?

56:51.575 --> 56:53.675
As a peace offering.

56:53.677 --> 56:55.077
Never mind.

56:55.079 --> 57:00.716
If you have a plan to get out of this, now
would be an excellent time to execute.

57:00.718 --> 57:02.484
Nothing really coming to mind.

57:04.454 --> 57:05.954
Enough of this dancing, loser.

57:08.792 --> 57:12.761
Let me down!
Let me down!

57:15.532 --> 57:17.199
Are you doing that?

57:17.201 --> 57:18.901
No, I thought you were.

57:24.207 --> 57:27.176
What are you doing?
Let me down!

57:32.882 --> 57:34.550
It's real.

57:37.988 --> 57:42.458
Ah! Let me down! Ah!

57:42.460 --> 57:45.160
I hope you guys didn't mind
me using another wish.

57:45.162 --> 57:47.863
Mind? That was awesome!

57:47.865 --> 57:51.567
Wait, that was your
wish you used up...

57:51.569 --> 57:53.135
For me?

57:53.137 --> 57:53.135
That's what friends do.

57:53.137 --> 57:57.906
We can't keep carrying this thing
around with us. It's too dangerous.

57:57.908 --> 58:00.108
We should leave it in a place
where it's gonna be safe.

58:00.110 --> 58:01.243
The clubhouse!

58:05.248 --> 58:06.815
Hey, kid.

58:08.618 --> 58:11.220
You know, I think we can
help each other out.

58:11.222 --> 58:11.220
Who are you?

58:11.222 --> 58:16.258
Let's just say I'm the guy
who understands your situation.

58:16.260 --> 58:18.794
You don't have many friends 'cause
you got a bad rap for being a bully

58:18.796 --> 58:21.830
when really you were the one who's
excluded and was misunderstood.

58:21.832 --> 58:26.034
And I know exactly how you feel.
Trust me, I was just like you.

58:26.036 --> 58:29.905
Now, you wanna get back at your
friends for what they did to you?

58:31.274 --> 58:32.708
I can help you do that.

58:36.161 --> 58:37.180
- Hey.
- You okay?

58:37.181 --> 58:41.083
I'm okay. I'm trying
not to be nervous.

58:41.085 --> 58:43.619
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be great.

58:43.621 --> 58:43.619
Have you seen Ricky?

58:43.621 --> 58:46.922
No, but he'll be here.
Don't worry.

58:46.924 --> 58:49.057
- Okay.
- Hey. Go get 'em.

58:49.059 --> 58:51.260
Thank you.
I'm gonna get started.

58:54.864 --> 58:57.833
Hello, everyone,
my name is Jane young,

58:57.835 --> 59:00.068
and I'm the director
of the science museum.

59:00.070 --> 59:03.805
First of all, I wanna thank you
all so much for being here.

59:03.807 --> 59:08.644
As many of you know, there has been
major cutbacks to our school systems,

59:08.646 --> 59:14.283
and that is one of the reasons, one of the
reasons, why it is so important to keep

59:14.285 --> 59:16.919
a place like
the science museum open.

59:16.921 --> 59:21.156
It is one of the last places that
our children can come to learn,

59:21.158 --> 59:24.059
and be inspired, and have fun.

59:24.061 --> 59:24.059
- Miss young.
- Yes.

59:24.061 --> 59:29.298
It simply makes no sense to keep
this failed institution open.

59:30.233 --> 59:32.568
An institution, I might add,

59:32.570 --> 59:35.804
that is costing the hardworking
taxpayers of this community

59:35.806 --> 59:38.907
hundreds of thousands of dollars
each and every year.

59:38.909 --> 59:43.679
My development, it's going to bring jobs
and prosperity back to these good people.

59:46.950 --> 59:49.651
All right, everyone,
please, if you could just...

59:53.590 --> 59:56.658
Imagine what we could do
if we had more wishes.

59:56.660 --> 01:00:00.829
I'd wish to have a roller
coaster in my backyard. No!

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:06.802
I'd wish to have my own drive-in
movie theater in my backyard.

01:00:06.804 --> 01:00:08.870
No, wait.

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:12.240
I'd wish to have my own
spaceship in my backyard.

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:15.344
Yep, definitely a spaceship.

01:00:15.346 --> 01:00:17.713
I'd wish for straight a pluses.

01:00:17.715 --> 01:00:20.048
You already have
straight a pluses.

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:23.819
Right. Then...

01:00:23.821 --> 01:00:27.122
I'd wish to be
the president of mensa.

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:30.092
I'd wish to have one more
day with my grandpa.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.361
Just one more.

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:35.664
That would be awesome.

01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:39.001
This wish box is like
having absolute power.

01:00:39.003 --> 01:00:40.836
Maybe that's not
such a good thing.

01:00:40.838 --> 01:00:42.838
What do you mean?

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.307
How does that old saying go?

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:47.643
Absolute power
corrupts absolutely.

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:47.643
Yeah, that one.

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:51.780
I'm thinking my grandpa hid
this thing away for a reason.

01:00:51.782 --> 01:00:53.649
I agree.

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:59.187
Maybe ozzie was right after all.
We should put it back.

01:00:59.189 --> 01:01:03.191
Whoa, whoa!
Let's not get crazy here.

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:05.293
We could have done anything
with this wish box,

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:07.729
but instead what
did we use it for?

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:09.865
For candy and to get
revenge on a bully.

01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:12.434
Both very valid
and necessary things.

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:16.338
Let's be reasonable. After all, Ricky
hasn't gotten to use his wish yet.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:20.042
You should use yours before we
give it back. Seems only fair.

01:01:20.044 --> 01:01:23.245
Fine. But I wanna
wish for something

01:01:23.247 --> 01:01:29.184
that's not selfish, something to help
other people, that's good for society.

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:33.755
- Boring.
- Okay, fine, what should it be?

01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:37.325
Like you said before, use it to
help save the science museum.

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:39.394
Oh, no! The science museum.

01:01:43.132 --> 01:01:45.300
Well, that guy was quite
the charmer, wasn't he?

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:48.170
Well, the municipality is leaning
his way, that's for sure.

01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:48.170
But they haven't made
their decision yet.

01:01:48.172 --> 01:01:52.240
I've still got time. You know,
i have the fundraiser coming up.

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:55.811
I know that's a long shot,
but I've got to try.

01:01:55.813 --> 01:01:57.879
You're amazing.
You just never give up, do you?

01:01:57.881 --> 01:01:59.448
I don't really have a choice.

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:02.117
Jane? Jane.

01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:04.920
Michael Langley,
do you remember me?

01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:06.855
- Michael?
- No beard, remember me now?

01:02:06.857 --> 01:02:09.324
Michael, what a surprise.
It's been years.

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:09.324
- Yeah.
- How are you?

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:13.228
Great, I'm really good. I just
saw you speak. That was amazing.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.063
She was amazing.
Did you see that?

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:16.465
- Yeah.
- You did, right?

01:02:16.467 --> 01:02:18.500
Thank you. What are
you doing in town?

01:02:18.502 --> 01:02:20.335
I'm just visiting, yeah.

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:20.335
Well, you've been
away for so long.

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:27.342
Yeah, I have. So what? You're the
director of the science museum?

01:02:27.344 --> 01:02:27.342
- I am.
- Wow.

01:02:27.344 --> 01:02:31.179
- That's just, that's incredible.
That's great. -Thank you.

01:02:31.181 --> 01:02:34.182
I should come by for like
a private tour or something.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:34.182
I love science.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:38.386
Oh, well, I'm happy to hear that.
Please do.

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:41.957
I'm so sorry. Michael, this is Martin.
Martin, Michael.

01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:44.326
- Hey, how are you.
Nice to meet you. -Hi.

01:02:44.328 --> 01:02:46.828
Wow, that's a cool jacket.
Look at all those pockets.

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:49.464
A fella could hide
a lot in there, huh?

01:02:49.466 --> 01:02:52.267
I'm sorry. Would you mind
excusing me for a moment?

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:52.267
- Sure.
- Okay, nice to see you.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:57.873
Really good to see you. It's been so long.
It's great to see you.

01:02:57.875 --> 01:02:59.341
- Bye.
- Okay, bye-bye, Michael.

01:02:59.343 --> 01:03:01.009
- I'll see you.
- See you soon.

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:02.210
- Okay, dear.
- I'll come by for sure.

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:03.545
Okay, bye-bye.

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:06.815
What the heck are you doing?

01:03:06.817 --> 01:03:09.050
I'm sorry I wasn't here, mom.

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:14.089
- Are you mad?
- No, sweetheart, I'm not mad.

01:03:14.091 --> 01:03:16.124
That's what you get when you
send a boy to do a man's job.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:18.994
No, no, that is not necessary.
I have this handled.

01:03:18.996 --> 01:03:21.963
Have it handled?
Did you find it?

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.498
- No.
- Exactly.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.401
It would have been
really nice for you to be here.

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:32.474
Okay, I'll see you at home, okay?
I've got a bit of work to do.

01:03:43.821 --> 01:03:46.454
I feel so bad for letting
my mom down like that.

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:50.392
Well, we can use the last wish
to save the science museum.

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:50.392
But how?

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:53.428
We can't just wish
for a million bucks.

01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:56.464
We'll figure something out.

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:15.350
Hey, somebody's been here!

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:25.026
We've been compromised.

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:27.362
- By who?

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:30.632
See you later, dorkuses!

01:04:30.634 --> 01:04:33.301
Who else? Seth.

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:34.936
Do you think he knows
about the wish box?

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:41.076
Well, after what happened in the park today,
he's got to be suspicious of something.

01:04:41.078 --> 01:04:43.144
We should follow him
and find out what he knows.

01:04:43.146 --> 01:04:46.982
What? The guy who nearly
beat us into oblivion?

01:04:46.984 --> 01:04:49.184
You want to follow him?

01:04:49.186 --> 01:04:51.620
And how is that a good idea?

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:21.683
Why did you call me here?

01:05:21.685 --> 01:05:24.152
You can't keep ordering me
around like this.

01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:27.155
I can do anything I want.
I own you.

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:29.357
Besides, I want you
to meet someone.

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:32.160
- Who?
- Your replacement.

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:36.665
Apparently, I did need
a boy to do a man's job.

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:41.703
Looks like a back alley business
meeting if I ever saw one.

01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:44.205
Though I never have,
except in movies.

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:46.508
What's Martin doing here?

01:05:48.077 --> 01:05:50.478
That's the guy I saw
talking to my mom.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.281
Who is that guy?

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:56.718
I don't know, but I don't
like the looks of him.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.988
- What are you gonna do? -You
never mind what I'm gonna do.

01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:01.489
Beat it.

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:07.062
If you do anything to hurt her,
i swear I will...

01:06:07.064 --> 01:06:11.499
If you don't want anything to happen to
her, then you better stay out of my way.

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:14.436
Get outta my way.
Get outta my way, man.

01:06:14.438 --> 01:06:16.738
I'm tryin' to get to my car. Why are
you in my way? Still in my way.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.273
Can you stop it, please?

01:06:18.275 --> 01:06:18.273
Okay, this is weird.

01:06:18.275 --> 01:06:26.275
First Seth, finds the clubhouse. Then Martin
is meeting with Seth and some strange guy.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:26.548
Something's going on.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:32.587
One thing's for sure, we can't let
anybody get their hands on the wish box.

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:35.657
I've got an idea.

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:50.405
Ozzie, you down here?

01:06:50.407 --> 01:06:52.440
Yeah, in the back.

01:06:56.612 --> 01:06:58.380
Hi.

01:06:58.382 --> 01:07:01.383
Ozzie, we need your help.

01:07:01.385 --> 01:07:03.785
Sure, I'm at your service.

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:06.421
We need something from you.

01:07:06.423 --> 01:07:10.258
Does this have anything to do at all
with what we talked about the other day?

01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:13.528
Yes.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:16.364
I'm sorry. We should
have listened to you.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.568
But you have to trust us, ozzie.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:22.737
We promise we'll make it right.

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:22.737
- Promise?
- -Promise.

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:25.673
- Cross your heart?
- -Cross our hearts.

01:07:25.675 --> 01:07:25.673
Double, double,
double pinky swear?

01:07:25.675 --> 01:07:28.543
Double, double,
double pinky swear.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:30.745
I'm in. What can I do for ya?

01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:32.147
Thanks, ozzie.

01:07:33.482 --> 01:07:35.450
And I'd also like
to make a purchase.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.260
Everything okay, guys?

01:07:45.262 --> 01:07:47.195
- Yep.
- Yeah?

01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:47.195
You gonna be all right
if I leave you tonight?

01:07:47.197 --> 01:07:51.533
I've got to go back to the science
museum to finish some stuff up

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:52.801
for the fundraiser tomorrow.

01:07:52.803 --> 01:07:54.569
- We'll be fine.
- Yeah?

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:56.271
- Yeah.
- Ricky?

01:07:56.273 --> 01:07:59.274
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:07:59.276 --> 01:08:02.310
All right. Clean up when you're finished,
okay, sweetie? I'll see you later.

01:08:02.312 --> 01:08:04.279
- Okay. Bye, mom.
- Bye.

01:08:04.281 --> 01:08:05.713
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:17.091
How was work today?

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:24.432
Work was fine.
Work was... fine.

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:28.336
You didn't happen to be
downtown, did you?

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:32.841
As a matter of fact, I was.

01:08:32.843 --> 01:08:36.743
Yeah, I had a meeting with a guy who's
thinking about selling his house.

01:08:38.613 --> 01:08:40.247
Why?

01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:41.749
No reason.

01:09:10.712 --> 01:09:12.279
Smart kid.

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:26.694
- Hey, what's going on?
- We need to talk.

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:30.265
Okay. About anything
in particular?

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:32.834
I need to tell you that...

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:35.470
Martin, it's okay.
What is it?

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:40.475
I just... I wanted to tell you
how much I... care about you.

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.546
Oh, good.

01:09:45.549 --> 01:09:47.715
Good. I care about you, too.

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:47.715
Okay, great.

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:53.555
Are you okay? You've been
acting a little funny lately.

01:09:53.557 --> 01:09:58.393
Yeah, no, I'm...
I'm fine. I'm totally fine.

01:09:58.395 --> 01:10:01.196
Okay, good. You're so sweet.
I'll see ya tonight.

01:10:01.198 --> 01:10:03.364
- Okay. Great.
- Okay, bye.

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.266
- All right.
- You're funny.

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:13.541
See ya.

01:11:12.069 --> 01:11:12.968
Hey, Jane.

01:11:12.969 --> 01:11:15.637
Say "science."

01:11:15.639 --> 01:11:18.740
Science. Michael!
You scared me.

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:21.309
- I'm sorry. I know.
- What are you doing here?

01:11:21.311 --> 01:11:24.646
Well, I came because of the tour
that you promised me.

01:11:24.648 --> 01:11:26.848
Oh no, Michael, look, we're
actually just about to close.

01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:29.651
That is so awesome!
We have the place to ourselves.

01:11:29.653 --> 01:11:31.019
That's great.

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:37.859
He fell for it.
Let's meet at the clubhouse.

01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:39.494
Copy, on my way.

01:11:39.496 --> 01:11:41.296
Copy, see you there.

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:51.039
I'm sorry, Mike, but I really think it'd
be better if you came back tomorrow.

01:11:51.041 --> 01:11:53.875
Oh, I can't come back tomorrow.
Tonight's the only night I can do this.

01:11:53.877 --> 01:11:53.875
Everything okay here,
miss young?

01:11:53.877 --> 01:11:57.011
Hold on a second.
Do me a favor. Take one.

01:11:57.013 --> 01:11:58.546
Oh, goodness.

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:01.883
All right.

01:12:01.885 --> 01:12:05.086
That's... you're kidding me.
You got two pairs of handcuffs.

01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:07.889
That is awesome. And a taser.

01:12:07.891 --> 01:12:09.657
That is just...
It's like Christmas for me.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:11.626
Oh, I'm so happy,
Michael. It's...

01:12:11.628 --> 01:12:13.788
You'll understand
that soon enough.

01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:17.532
Martin's in on it.
I saw him take the bag.

01:12:17.534 --> 01:12:19.967
Oh, Ricky, I'm so sorry.

01:12:19.969 --> 01:12:23.404
We've got to use the last wish to save
the science museum before it's too late.

01:12:23.406 --> 01:12:25.840
It's already too late.

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:31.446
It's my duty to serve and protect
this institution and I have...

01:12:31.448 --> 01:12:35.416
Don't beat yourself up.
You can't win every game.

01:12:35.418 --> 01:12:38.886
Now look... yeah, I'm gonna
borrow that, all right?

01:12:38.888 --> 01:12:40.355
Thanks.

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:46.461
Is it true that you have
a gyrosphere here?

01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:49.130
Let's go see it.

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:55.069
Don't go away.

01:12:55.071 --> 01:12:59.040
I guess this proves you losers aren't
much of an adventure club after all.

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:00.641
Seth, don't do this.

01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:02.410
You're not one of the bad guys.

01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:02.410
Who said I was?

01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:06.013
I'm sorry we never
included you in our club.

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:08.716
I never wanted to be
a part of your stupid club.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:08.716
Yes, you did.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:14.889
And we didn't include you,
so for that, I'm sorry.

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:16.791
I don't care.

01:13:16.793 --> 01:13:18.526
Take care of their bikes.

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:27.769
Forget it.
Let's just go on foot.

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:31.005
No, wait. I've got an idea.

01:13:32.097 --> 01:13:33.776
Langley, what are you doing?

01:13:33.777 --> 01:13:38.946
Well, I can't tie you to the train tracks.
They're clear across town.

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:45.686
And the hero enters
riding on his hipster jeans.

01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:49.690
Okay, Langley, you win. You take
this and get the heck outta here.

01:13:49.692 --> 01:13:51.092
You two know each other?

01:13:51.094 --> 01:13:54.595
Oh, yeah, we go way back.
You wanna explain?

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:57.565
- Martin, what is going on?
- Yeah, Martin, what's going on?

01:13:57.567 --> 01:13:57.565
Why don't you explain it to her?

01:13:57.567 --> 01:14:02.703
'Cause I'm too busy
destroying the fake wish box.

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:06.174
Really? You think I'm that stupid
to fall for that silly trick?

01:14:06.176 --> 01:14:08.776
And here I thought you had
such potential as a criminal.

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:11.212
Criminal?

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:14.949
I'm sorry.
I tried to tell you.

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:17.785
What, so was
everything just a lie?

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:21.489
No, no, not everything. I promise you.
You're never gonna get away with this.

01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:24.025
What do you mean?
I already have.

01:14:24.027 --> 01:14:25.726
What do you think
my first wish is?

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:28.629
- What?
- To get away with it.

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:32.967
Criminal genius.
It's kinda my jam.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:35.136
But you don't even
have the real wish box.

01:14:35.138 --> 01:14:35.136
Oh, don't I?

01:14:35.138 --> 01:14:41.976
Oh, god, I just love this kid's timing.
It's impeccable.

01:14:44.214 --> 01:14:45.880
What do we got?

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:51.586
You know what?
Penelope ain't so bad.

01:14:54.556 --> 01:14:58.025
Yeah! Nice.

01:14:58.027 --> 01:14:58.025
- Uh, Mr. Langley, sir?
- Yeah.

01:14:58.027 --> 01:15:03.698
I was just wondering if you were gonna
follow through on your end of the deal.

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:06.100
What exactly is
my end of the deal?

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:08.803
You promised me one of
your wishes if I helped you.

01:15:08.805 --> 01:15:10.571
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

01:15:10.573 --> 01:15:13.674
No, I didn't.
Look, well, if I did, I lied.

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:18.112
Just chalk it up to a valuable lesson
in a life of crime. Now, beat it.

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:47.208
You guys wait here.
I've got this.

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:47.208
Are you sure?

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:53.915
Yeah. It's my wish. I've got
to take care of this myself.

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:58.319
- Good luck.
- Go get 'em, Ricky!

01:15:58.321 --> 01:16:02.189
Now, we're talking.
Phase one of my master plan.

01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:20.208
It's not working.

01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:25.980
Why isn't it working? What's wrong
with this thing? Why isn't it working?

01:16:25.982 --> 01:16:28.349
Because you forgot
one very important detail.

01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:32.620
Ricky. You brought
Ricky into this?

01:16:32.622 --> 01:16:34.322
You brought Ricky into this?

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:39.026
The box only grants wishes
to the pure of heart.

01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:45.032
Come on, man, the pure of heart? Enough
with the fairy tale crap. Really?

01:16:45.034 --> 01:16:46.734
Mom, are you okay?

01:16:46.736 --> 01:16:48.369
Yes, sweetheart, I'm fine.

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:51.739
I still have one last wish
granted to me.

01:16:51.741 --> 01:16:53.774
And I'm willing to make a deal.

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:56.944
I'll agree to wish for you
to have unlimited wishes,

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:59.647
giving you complete
control over the box.

01:16:59.649 --> 01:17:01.148
Be careful, Ricky.

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:04.385
Hold on a minute.
What are your terms?

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:06.887
I only have one condition.

01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:11.225
You free my mom
and let us go forever.

01:17:11.227 --> 01:17:14.095
That's two conditions.

01:17:14.097 --> 01:17:19.000
Think about it, Langley. Anything
you've ever wanted... for eternity.

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:23.704
All right, you have a deal.

01:17:25.173 --> 01:17:27.174
But I wanna see you write it
down with my own eyes.

01:17:27.377 --> 01:17:28.276
Fair enough.

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:33.681
No, I want to dictate it. That way I'm
sure that the wording is correct.

01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:41.088
"I hereby wish
for Michael carruthers..."

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:43.891
don't say it... "Langley..."

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:50.131
To have unlimited wishes
for all time in perpetuity."

01:17:51.099 --> 01:17:53.334
- That's p-e-r-p...
- I got it.

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:58.105
- Satisfied?
- Yes, very.

01:17:58.107 --> 01:18:00.107
All right, come on.
Let's get on with this shindig.

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:03.911
Give me the keys
to the cuffs first.

01:18:03.913 --> 01:18:05.446
No, make the wish first.

01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:07.815
You think I'm stupid?

01:18:07.817 --> 01:18:11.018
No, I don't. That's really...
He's a smart kid.

01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:44.719
Hey, that... hey! Hey! Hey!

01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:46.053
Ricky!

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:49.223
How did you do this?

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:51.859
Disappearing ink.

01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:53.728
Good ol' ozzie
came through again.

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:55.162
That wish box is mine!

01:18:55.164 --> 01:18:57.498
That wish box
doesn't belong to anyone.

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.433
No human should
possess this kind of power.

01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:02.236
Which is exactly
why I should have it.

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:05.873
God, you are your
grandfather's grandson.

01:19:05.875 --> 01:19:07.875
I am my grandfather's grandson.

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:10.111
And I'm proud of that.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.016
Are you okay?

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:21.455
Yeah, I'm okay.
How are you?

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:23.959
I think I'll live.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:30.765
You good? I'm glad. I'm not okay.
Not okay here. I'm not fine.

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:35.102
We're not done.
We're not done, you and me.

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:37.471
I'm so sorry, mom.

01:19:37.473 --> 01:19:37.471
What?

01:19:37.473 --> 01:19:44.078
When I finally realized i could use it
to help you save the science museum,

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.780
it was too late.

01:19:46.548 --> 01:19:48.382
I feel like I let you down.

01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:52.520
Oh, Ricky, no, you didn't.

01:19:52.522 --> 01:19:56.557
There is nothing more important
to me in this world than you.

01:19:56.559 --> 01:19:59.193
Naturally, I had
everything under control.

01:19:59.195 --> 01:20:01.328
That's him right there,
officers.

01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:03.030
Oh, thank god you guys are here.

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:07.468
Yeah.

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:15.409
I know I'm the last guy you
probably want to talk to right now,

01:20:15.411 --> 01:20:18.879
but I just wonder if you'd give
me a chance to explain myself.

01:20:19.915 --> 01:20:21.215
Mom.

01:20:23.051 --> 01:20:25.186
I'll keep this in
a safe place, miss young.

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:30.324
Thanks, Curtis.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:37.398
The truth is, is that I'm an archaeologist,
like your grandfather, Ricky.

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:42.536
The only difference is that
i got involved with some guys

01:20:42.538 --> 01:20:46.574
that I thought were legit, but they
turned out to be gangsters who sold stuff

01:20:46.576 --> 01:20:49.543
on the black market,
namely Langley.

01:20:49.545 --> 01:20:53.047
- He was looking for this precious artifact.
- The wish box.

01:20:53.049 --> 01:20:54.248
Yeah.

01:20:56.184 --> 01:21:02.590
He told me that all I had to do
was get close to this woman...

01:21:02.592 --> 01:21:06.894
And her son and find out anything
I could, and if I did that,

01:21:06.896 --> 01:21:08.996
then he'd let me
go free forever.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.131
It seemed so easy.

01:21:13.568 --> 01:21:16.503
That is until I met
that woman...

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:19.006
And her son.

01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:23.416
I fell in love
with both of them.

01:21:24.646 --> 01:21:28.249
Hey, you blew it, kid.
You had your chance.

01:21:28.251 --> 01:21:31.418
You haven't heard the last
of me, Ricky Martin.

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:36.190
I'll see ya in the big house, where you
belong. Oh, and Jane, don't wait for me.

01:21:36.192 --> 01:21:39.093
Live your life,
you rambling rose.

01:21:40.428 --> 01:21:42.529
Martin, don't listen to him.

01:21:44.299 --> 01:21:46.166
Langley blackmailed you.

01:21:46.168 --> 01:21:49.270
He's the one that
should go to jail, not you.

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:54.008
Besides, we're a family now.

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:55.476
You really think so?

01:21:55.478 --> 01:21:56.478
Yeah.

01:21:58.446 --> 01:22:00.314
But I'm not the one
you have to convince.

01:22:06.988 --> 01:22:09.957
Hey, that was awesome
what you did back there.

01:22:09.959 --> 01:22:11.292
Yeah, well done, bro.

01:22:11.294 --> 01:22:14.528
It was all of us, team effort.

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:16.430
Score one for
the adventure club.

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:21.602
Is there anything else
i need to know?

01:22:21.604 --> 01:22:27.474
No. I mean, let's be honest, i was never a
very good criminal anyway. I mean, look at me.

01:22:27.476 --> 01:22:31.345
I just wanted to say, good job. And
that I'm sorry for everything.

01:22:31.347 --> 01:22:34.949
You guys were right. All I really
wanted was to be part of the club.

01:22:34.951 --> 01:22:37.051
Thanks, Seth.

01:22:37.053 --> 01:22:40.587
You know what?
You are part of the club.

01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:54.335
Well, unfortunately, you guys, i think
that I'm gonna have to concede defeat.

01:22:54.337 --> 01:22:57.338
There is no way that I'm gonna be able to
raise enough money by the end of the month

01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:00.307
to save the science museum.

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:02.743
You know, sometimes you can't
make all your wishes come true.

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:05.379
Don't say that.

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:09.616
"True wishes
are granted from within."

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:13.387
Maybe we can.

01:23:13.389 --> 01:23:15.556
What do you mean?

01:23:15.558 --> 01:23:17.992
I think I understand what
grandpa meant by this note.

01:23:17.994 --> 01:23:21.628
At first, I thought he meant
from within the wish box,

01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:25.532
but he didn't, because
those aren't true wishes.

01:23:25.534 --> 01:23:28.135
True wishes are granted
from within yourself.

01:23:28.137 --> 01:23:30.304
It's up to you to make
your wishes come true.

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:34.675
Don't you see? We can
save the science museum.

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:46.520
All right, folks, single
file, single file.

01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:49.490
Let's keep everything moving
in an orderly fashion.

01:23:55.363 --> 01:24:00.267
Isn't this amazing? How are we doing?
Good. Okay.

01:24:00.269 --> 01:24:02.169
Sorry.

01:24:02.171 --> 01:24:06.040
I gotta say,
this is pretty amazing.

01:24:06.042 --> 01:24:09.343
All this thanks
to our first adventure.

01:24:09.345 --> 01:24:12.112
It took a while,
but it was a doozy.

01:24:12.114 --> 01:24:15.182
I'll say.
My only question is,

01:24:15.184 --> 01:24:17.284
what adventure are we
gonna go on next?

01:24:17.286 --> 01:24:17.284
I'm sure something will come up.

01:24:17.286 --> 01:24:22.289
You guys are the kids who
recovered the wish box, right?

01:24:22.291 --> 01:24:23.657
That's right.

01:24:23.659 --> 01:24:25.559
That was pretty amazing.

01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:27.761
Thanks. Who are you?

01:24:27.763 --> 01:24:32.266
I work for an agency called the
international artifact society.

01:24:32.268 --> 01:24:32.266
We work with archaeologists
around the world

01:24:32.268 --> 01:24:39.373
recovering lost, precious relics and ensuring
they do not fall into the wrong hands.

01:24:39.375 --> 01:24:42.409
In fact, we did a lot of work
with your grandfather.

01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:45.479
- Really? -Someone you know thought
that maybe we should meet.

01:24:47.782 --> 01:24:51.552
It's really nice seeing you follow
in your grandfather's footsteps.

01:24:51.554 --> 01:24:54.421
All of you, keep up
the good work.

01:24:54.423 --> 01:24:56.557
- We'll be in touch.
- Thank you.

01:24:56.559 --> 01:24:57.858
Look at this.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.594
That was so cool.

01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:02.296
Super cool!

01:25:02.298 --> 01:25:04.131
Long live the adventure club.

01:25:04.133 --> 01:25:05.466
Bam!

01:25:06.535 --> 01:25:08.202
Zing.

01:25:08.204 --> 01:25:09.603
Adventure club!

01:28:18.059 --> 01:28:20.394
Hmm.

01:28:20.396 --> 01:28:22.596
- That's it.
That's all I got.
