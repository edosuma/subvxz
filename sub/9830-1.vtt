01:59.119 --> 02:02.663
- Do you know where you are?
- No.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.249
It's changed too much.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.463
Oh, no.

02:23.685 --> 02:24.935
Oh, no.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.696
Yeah...

02:36.823 --> 02:39.158
So change the tire.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.911
I help you. Change the tire.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.310
- Are we at the hotel?
- Flat tire.

03:35.965 --> 03:39.927
Now do you know where you are? Yes.

04:19.466 --> 04:21.385
- Walker?
Walker.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.479
Thank you.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.559
- May I?
- Oh, please.

05:11.394 --> 05:14.980
"On arrival, please confirm luncheon
at the Jules Verne in the Eiffel Tower...

05:15.148 --> 05:18.817
...today at 1 pm.
Regards, Dr. Maurice Alembert.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.696
Numero 45-84-32-53."

06:22.215 --> 06:25.092
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

06:25.259 --> 06:27.260
Nice fruits.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.889
Yeah, well,
I would have preferred flowers.

06:31.057 --> 06:34.267
Nice view.
- It's magnificent.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.939
It should look exceptionally lovely
from the Eiffel Tower this afternoon...

06:39.107 --> 06:42.776
...where you and Dr. Alembert
can share it together.

06:44.153 --> 06:46.738
I wanna take a hot shower.

06:46.906 --> 06:50.325
But first, let me have the notes
so that I can confirm your iuncheon.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.493
What for?

06:51.661 --> 06:54.371
You can't speak French and
don't know how to use the phone.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.164
I'm not gonna go, don't confirm.

06:56.332 --> 06:59.751
Why not? You did tell Alembert you
were arriving a day eariy, didn't you?

06:59.919 --> 07:02.087
- Honey.
- Richard, you obviously wanna see him.

07:02.255 --> 07:05.966
- Just give me the note. Don't mess around.
- I didn't tell him when I was coming.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.511
Maurice Alemb... Maurice Alembert...

07:09.679 --> 07:13.890
...happens to be
the chairman of the convention.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.726
- Richard, give me the note.
- No.

07:16.894 --> 07:19.604
Give me the...
Richard, give me that. Listen...

07:26.070 --> 07:28.280
Richard, don't swallow it.
You're gonna choke.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.198
Now she says...

07:36.289 --> 07:39.624
Well, at least iet me get you
some water to wash it down.

07:43.671 --> 07:47.799
Honey, Maurice Aiembert
doesn't give a rat's ass about me.

07:47.967 --> 07:51.094
Now, since he saw you
at the Berkeley seminar last year:

07:51.262 --> 07:54.097
"Oui, your lovely wife.
Make sure to bring her to Paris. "

07:54.265 --> 07:58.226
Was he the one with the long legs
who took his shoes off when he spoke?

08:00.062 --> 08:01.104
Never mind.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.905
How do you feel?
Do you want some breakfast?

08:10.072 --> 08:12.324
I've already eaten, thanks.

08:13.951 --> 08:16.912
I'm gonna order some cafe au iait
and croissants. You want some?

08:17.205 --> 08:18.830
Yes.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.251
Hello. Room service?

08:27.215 --> 08:30.050
Uh... Over here, please.

08:53.533 --> 08:57.118
- Honey, I'm gonna call the kids.
- You can dial direct.

08:57.286 --> 08:58.912
I know.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.333
- Um...
- Zero.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.795
Zero.
- One-nine.

09:08.297 --> 09:11.341
- One-nine.
- One.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.135
- Yeah?
- Four-one-five.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.804
Got it.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.985
Walkers' residence.
- Hey, buddy.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.861
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing?

09:32.029 --> 09:34.990
- I'm all right.
- It's 11:00 at night, Richard.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.993
- Yeah.
- What are you doing up?

09:38.160 --> 09:40.370
You woke me up.

09:40.830 --> 09:44.499
- I know. Just testing.
- Sure, Dad.

09:44.834 --> 09:49.337
Before that, somebody else called
from Paris for Mom.

09:49.505 --> 09:52.173
Somebody called for you from Paris.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.968
- Wha...?
- I don't know anybody in Paris.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.511
Hold on a second.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.346
- Mom wants to say hello.
- All right.

09:58.514 --> 10:02.183
Would you make these keys work?
I can't get my suitcase open.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.644
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.187
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.982
- Are you sleeping?
- Yeah.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.400
Who called me?

10:10.568 --> 10:14.654
- I don't know. Casey talked to him.
- Him? Would you put Casey on?

10:14.822 --> 10:15.947
She's not here.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.075
She left you alone?
- Casey's out?

10:19.243 --> 10:21.578
- Yeah, she's out on a date.
- When did she go out?

10:21.746 --> 10:25.373
- I don't know. She probably left around...
You're not scared, are you?

10:25.541 --> 10:27.751
- No.
- No. You got that number?

10:27.918 --> 10:29.711
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you have our number?

10:29.879 --> 10:32.714
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Well, you can call us anytime, okay?

10:32.882 --> 10:33.882
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.759
- We'll call you tomorrow?
- All right.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.802
- Sweet dreams, my love.
- Good night, Mom.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.429
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.558
No wonder you can't get the keys to work.

10:43.726 --> 10:47.228
- It's not your suitcase.
- What do you mean, it's not my suitcase?

10:47.396 --> 10:51.650
I mean it's not your suitcase. It doesn't
have your nametag. There's no name at all.

10:51.817 --> 10:55.528
The keys don't work.
It's not your suitcase, dummy.

11:01.285 --> 11:06.247
Walker, you did this on purpose because
you want me to go shopping in Paris.

11:06.415 --> 11:07.874
- Au contraire, my dear.
- Oh, no?

11:08.042 --> 11:13.421
No, no, no. I'll get on TWA right away
and get it straightened out. Heh.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.926
Yes, please. Would you get me TWA?

11:18.969 --> 11:20.887
Besides...

11:21.472 --> 11:23.682
The lost luggage department, piease.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.643
Besides, for the next 24 hours...

11:26.811 --> 11:29.813
...you're not gonna need anything to wear.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.732
Promises, promises.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.359
TWA, bonjour.

11:34.527 --> 11:39.114
Yes, please, I was on Flight 862
this morning from San Francisco.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.365
Eight-six-two, yes.

11:40.533 --> 11:44.285
And my wife, apparently,
picked up the wrong bag.

11:44.453 --> 11:47.455
- Samsonite?
- Yes, Samsonite. You have it?

11:47.623 --> 11:51.126
Oh, we have to look, but it's
always Samsonite. They look alike.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.920
- What. S your tag number?
- The tag number is...

11:56.966 --> 11:59.676
- Hoid on a second, please.
- Okay.

12:10.020 --> 12:13.314
The Grand Hotel Intercontinental.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.152
Richard Walker.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.579
So how about it?

12:27.747 --> 12:30.039
They're gonna send somebody
to pick this one up...

12:30.207 --> 12:32.751
...and then we gotta
fill out a form for yours.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.503
And then we gotta hope
that whoever's got your stuff...

12:35.671 --> 12:39.799
...doesn't like it better than their own.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.969
I was talking about breakfast in bed.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.930
Be with you in a minute.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.716
Walker!

13:26.222 --> 13:28.890
Honey, I can't hear you.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.973
You're awful quiet in there, babe.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.392
Haven't gone to sleep on me, have you?

14:14.186 --> 14:17.730
I ain't in here shaving for drill.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.366
You gonna get that, babe?

14:49.430 --> 14:50.805
Where...?

14:52.349 --> 14:53.683
Come in.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.562
Excuse me.

15:04.528 --> 15:05.987
Thank you.

16:21.230 --> 16:25.566
- Thank you.
- This is your les affaires de toilette.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.633
- Yes, certainly.
- Yeah, I can get that?

18:13.801 --> 18:16.010
Can they fix a special dinner
for mademoiselle?

18:16.178 --> 18:17.970
Yes.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.515
I'm looking for my wife.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.984
Where's the guy who was here
this morning?

18:32.152 --> 18:34.195
Good-looking guy, was here this morning
when I checked in.

18:35.572 --> 18:37.782
He stops work at 8.

18:37.991 --> 18:40.368
Perhaps I can help you.

18:41.870 --> 18:45.540
Is the manager in? I'd like to speak to him.
Would you get him for me, piease?

18:45.707 --> 18:48.793
Certainly, sir. If you please.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.222
Monsieur Walker.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.099
- Yes.
- You wish to see me?

19:03.267 --> 19:05.184
Yes, thank you.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.229
- I checked in this morning with my wife.
- Yes.

19:08.397 --> 19:11.023
- While I was in the shower, she left.
- Yes.

19:11.191 --> 19:14.026
- And she hasn't come back.
- Well, how may I help you?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.242
- Does she know Paris?
- Beg your pardon.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.996
- Maybe she's lost.
- No, no, no. She wouldn't have gone out.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.082
She ieft her bag
and she would have told me.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.170
- Ah.
- It's for me?

19:35.591 --> 19:38.259
Thank you. Hello?
Yes. Dr. Walker?

19:38.427 --> 19:39.552
Yes?

19:39.720 --> 19:42.263
Hello, Dr. Janet Perelman.
Did you have a pleasant trip?

19:42.431 --> 19:44.640
- Yes, thank you.
- Dr. Alembert asked me to call.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.601
We have a slight scheduling problem.

19:46.768 --> 19:50.021
Aortic valves seem to be
a particularly temperamental group.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.316
We wonder if you'd mind moving up,
reading your paper tomorrow at 3?

19:53.483 --> 19:55.109
- No, no problem.
- Oh, good.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.612
- We'll get your slides in the morning.
- Right. Yes.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.072
And about the lunch at the Eiffel Tower...

20:00.240 --> 20:03.451
...would you like us to pick you up
or can you get there on your own?

20:03.619 --> 20:05.411
I'm afraid we're gonna have to cancel.

20:05.579 --> 20:06.996
- Oh, what a pity.
- I'm sorry.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.623
It sounds like a tourist trap...

20:08.790 --> 20:11.751
...but it's not. The food is marvelous.
- No. That's not it.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.212
It's unavoidable, I'm afraid.

20:14.379 --> 20:18.925
Well, Dr. Alembert was hoping to see you
and your wife before the madness starts.

20:19.092 --> 20:22.970
- I'll have him call you back today.
- Yes, thank you.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.348
Well?

20:25.515 --> 20:29.727
- No, it was something else.
- This is Pascal, our head of security.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.480
Does your wife know anybody
in the hotel?

20:33.482 --> 20:36.150
- Not that I know of.
- Have you checked with the concierge?

20:36.318 --> 20:39.737
- He may have seen something.
- He's off duty. It was Gai...

20:39.905 --> 20:40.988
- Gaillard.
- Gaillard.

20:41.156 --> 20:44.075
- Why don't we try to give him a ring?
- Oh, please.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.540
Is your wife diabetic or...?

20:51.708 --> 20:56.379
I'm a doctor. It's not a medical probiem.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.346
He says his father is sleeping.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.145
He's not supposed to wake him.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.995
We'll call back later.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.746
Have you checked around the hotel?

21:30.914 --> 21:35.918
Yes. I looked in the newspaper place,
the bar, outside, everywhere.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.045
How about the ladies' room?

21:38.964 --> 21:40.256
No.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.123
Well, cleariy, she's not here.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.359
Wait.

22:41.777 --> 22:45.696
Just a second, please.
Excuse me, I'm looking for this lady.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.240
I'm looking... I think she might...

22:50.619 --> 22:52.119
Um... I'm looking for my wife.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.706
I'm... My wife. She might have...

23:22.567 --> 23:23.651
Espresso, please.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.197
Excuse me, you speak Engiish?

23:29.116 --> 23:30.282
My wife.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.457
Yeah, what do you want?

23:38.625 --> 23:40.793
I'm looking for my wife, this one here.

23:40.961 --> 23:43.504
I was wondering if she might have
come in this morning.

23:43.672 --> 23:46.048
She had no coat.
She was wearing a red dress.

23:50.512 --> 23:53.139
A lot of people come here,
you know. Sorry.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.936
Over there, this morning, in the passage.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.063
A man put a woman in the car.

24:04.734 --> 24:06.402
This woman?

24:07.112 --> 24:10.865
Coming. Coming with me.
I explain to you.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.533
Please.

24:14.870 --> 24:17.121
I'm sorry. How much?

24:17.289 --> 24:20.666
- Five.
- All right. Thank you.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.422
- Twelve.
- Twelve.

24:41.730 --> 24:43.522
Yes, it is true.

24:45.358 --> 24:48.110
Incredible story.

24:50.489 --> 24:51.530
Exactly, exactly.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.327
They saw everything.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.412
They saw what? What did they see?

24:58.580 --> 25:02.583
One man push with brutality
the poor woman in the car.

25:13.970 --> 25:16.222
- When? When?
- They go back later, you know?

25:18.683 --> 25:21.769
Do you have a cigarette?

25:23.104 --> 25:25.356
I don't smoke, but...

25:26.066 --> 25:28.567
...that should be enough.

26:05.146 --> 26:06.730
Eyes?

26:07.107 --> 26:09.108
Blue. Blue-gray, really.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.243
Face?

26:20.036 --> 26:22.371
- What about it?
- The shape.

26:22.539 --> 26:26.959
It's thin and narrow at the jaw,
with a rounded forehead.

26:32.173 --> 26:35.175
- Paris.
- City of Lights. Ha-ha.

26:35.343 --> 26:38.512
Listen, listen. I expect you people
to take me seriously, you know?

26:38.680 --> 26:42.016
You are being taken
perfectly seriously here, sir.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.852
As a matter of fact,
you have a special treatment.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.396
Usually we fill out this form
after a week or so.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.857
Usually we just take a deposition.

26:50.025 --> 26:53.485
SPEAKS IN FRENCH]

26:53.653 --> 26:56.363
Okay? This is the procedure.

26:59.492 --> 27:03.370
Photo.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.565
You see, the thing is,
even if they find Mrs. Walker...

27:31.733 --> 27:34.860
...they cannot disclose her whereabouts
without her consent.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.738
Unless you get the attorney
to make a formal request.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.198
What are you talking about?

27:39.366 --> 27:41.742
Why wouldn't my wife
want me to know where she's at?

27:41.910 --> 27:43.911
You and your wife
have been to Paris before?

27:44.079 --> 27:45.287
Yes, on our honeymoon.

27:45.455 --> 27:49.917
Is it possible she met someone then,
someone she has been thinking about?

27:52.420 --> 27:55.130
Since June 15, 1968?

27:55.298 --> 27:58.342
Please, don't take offense.
I'm an ex-cop.

27:58.510 --> 28:02.096
- We've seen this type of thing before.
- Can we call the concierge again...

28:02.263 --> 28:04.014
...see if he's awake?

28:11.272 --> 28:13.607
- It's his wife. Gaillard's gone out.
- Where?

28:16.194 --> 28:17.194
Gym Tonic?

28:17.362 --> 28:20.155
- Gin and Tonic? A bar?
- Gym Tonic. A gymnasium.

28:23.576 --> 28:25.285
Did you get an address?

28:31.501 --> 28:36.630
Gym Tonic.

28:56.901 --> 29:00.571
- They don't take calls for customers.
- Tell them it's an emergency.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.075
They hung up.

29:44.199 --> 29:47.326
- It's Walker. Dr. Walker.
- 402.

29:47.494 --> 29:51.246
- That's right.
- Is there something I can do for you, sir?

29:51.414 --> 29:56.543
- Yes. My wife, do you remember my wife?
- Yes.

29:56.920 --> 30:00.380
She ieft the hotel this morning
while you were on duty, I think.

30:00.548 --> 30:03.842
- Did you see her?
- Yes, I spoke to her.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.303
What did she say?

30:06.471 --> 30:09.640
She asked me to send up
some toilet articles...

30:09.808 --> 30:12.518
...and then she ieft with the man
who had called her.

30:13.895 --> 30:18.899
- I don't understand. The man who...
- Well, a man...

30:19.067 --> 30:21.902
...asked me if Mrs. Walker
was staying at the hotel.

30:22.070 --> 30:24.905
I said she was. So he called your room.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.866
Then, a few minutes later,
your wife came down...

30:28.034 --> 30:32.412
...she asked me to get her
some toothpaste, a toothbrush and...

30:32.580 --> 30:35.249
How do you call to take off makeup?

30:35.416 --> 30:38.669
Take makeup off your face. It's...

30:38.837 --> 30:40.504
- Cotton balls.
- Cotton balls.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.589
And they left together.

30:43.299 --> 30:45.259
Is there some probiem?

30:48.513 --> 30:51.890
Did she seem to know him?
Were they talking together?

30:52.058 --> 30:54.351
Did you notice anything else?

30:54.644 --> 30:57.980
I noticed she had wet hair,
which is a bit strange.

30:58.147 --> 31:01.441
I didn't really hear
what they were saying but...

31:01.609 --> 31:03.777
...he had his arm around her.

31:06.364 --> 31:10.784
- Around her waist or...?
- No, around her shoulder.

31:13.830 --> 31:17.082
What...? What did he iook like, this man?

31:17.625 --> 31:21.295
Tall, well-dressed, mustache, dark skin.

31:21.462 --> 31:23.338
He had an accent.

31:23.631 --> 31:27.634
- An accent?
- Not American, if you know what I mean.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.804
More like Middle East.

31:35.685 --> 31:39.605
- Thank you very much for your help.
- No, no. Dr. Walker. No, no.

31:42.108 --> 31:44.443
I'm sorry. Thank you very much.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.826
I'm sorry, sir.
You'll have to wait your turn.

31:52.994 --> 31:57.664
- But this is an emergency, you understand?
- Yes, sir.

31:57.832 --> 32:00.083
You understand,
but don't give a damn, is that it?

32:00.251 --> 32:04.755
I'm sorry, sir. We have a iot of emergencies.
You have to wait like everyone else.

32:04.923 --> 32:08.300
Has everyone eise had
their wife kidnapped?

32:08.468 --> 32:10.469
I don't know, sir.

32:30.698 --> 32:32.616
Where you from, sir?

32:33.493 --> 32:36.745
San Francisco,
just like it says on the passport.

32:38.998 --> 32:41.500
Can you step through
the metai detector, please?

32:41.668 --> 32:43.794
Here, I'll take that, sir.

32:46.255 --> 32:49.216
Wanna step back through and remove
all the metal objects from your pockets.

33:01.354 --> 33:04.272
- I keep your passport.
- Thank you.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.984
You're supposed to wear this pass
in the building, sir.

33:07.151 --> 33:09.403
Thank you. Go in.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.081
Eyes?

33:21.249 --> 33:24.251
Blue, both of them.

33:25.044 --> 33:26.336
Blue.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.755
- Face?
- Oval. Look...

33:28.923 --> 33:31.800
I know this must seem like
annoying bureaucracy, but really...

33:31.968 --> 33:35.679
...we have to get one of these to the police
when we deal with a missing person.

33:35.847 --> 33:39.266
I've already been to the police.
I filled out one of these damn forms.

33:39.434 --> 33:42.936
And it's not a missing person.
It's a kidnapping.

33:43.104 --> 33:45.856
Don't you think that's a bit premature
to be so positive?

33:46.024 --> 33:50.777
No, I don't think. I have witnesses.
My wife was kidnapped.

33:50.945 --> 33:54.197
- Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

33:54.365 --> 33:57.242
But what would you like us
to do, exactly?

33:59.829 --> 34:01.455
I want you to find my wife.

34:03.416 --> 34:07.669
Well, you understand, Dr. Walker,
ours is basically a liaison function.

34:07.837 --> 34:10.505
We can assist you in communicating
with the French police.

34:10.672 --> 34:14.134
We can put pressure on the Ministry
of Interior. But this is their country.

34:14.302 --> 34:18.472
It's their jurisdiction.
We can't just send a posse out after her.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.556
What do you do here?

34:21.726 --> 34:24.728
I'm head of American Services.
Visa applications...

34:24.937 --> 34:29.315
...registering births, any kind of general...
- Is there somebody here who can help me?

34:33.821 --> 34:36.822
Why don't you have a word
with our security officer?

34:37.617 --> 34:41.828
- Are you rich?
- No. Well, I'm well-off. I'm a surgeon.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.496
- You involved in politics?
- No.

34:43.664 --> 34:44.956
What about your wife?

34:45.123 --> 34:49.002
The same.
We don't even vote anymore, I'm afraid.

34:49.170 --> 34:52.089
There doesn't seem to be much
to support your kidnapping theory.

34:52.255 --> 34:55.675
This is your only evidence?
She could have just dropped it.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.679
It's a bit flimsy, doesn't close very well.

34:59.847 --> 35:01.807
It used to.

35:03.184 --> 35:05.435
You were in the shower
when this person called?

35:05.603 --> 35:06.645
Yes.

35:06.813 --> 35:09.940
So you didn't actually hear
any of their conversation?

35:10.399 --> 35:12.776
No, none of it.

35:12.944 --> 35:17.030
They spoke for a moment and then
she went downstairs to meet him.

35:17.198 --> 35:18.907
Meet him?

35:19.075 --> 35:20.492
Yes, meet him.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.662
And when they left the hotel,
he had his arm around her.

35:23.830 --> 35:26.206
- Dr. Walker.
- He had his arm around her.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.709
Here, like this.
He could have had a gun. Like this.

35:29.877 --> 35:31.878
Here. Pointed right at her.

35:32.046 --> 35:35.882
"Shut up. Smile. Walk. Out the lobby. "
Like this, huh?

35:36.717 --> 35:41.471
Yes. Yes, it couid mean that. Or they
could've just been having a good time.

35:44.308 --> 35:47.352
Mr. Shaap, you're talking about my wife.

35:48.062 --> 35:50.730
You must be thinking about yours.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.175
402, please.

36:21.888 --> 36:22.929
What's this?

36:26.434 --> 36:28.602
Jesus, the suitcase.

36:28.978 --> 36:30.520
- No other messages?
- No, sir.

36:30.688 --> 36:31.730
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.232
He asked if you could leave it
in the luggage room.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.568
Yeah. Can I have my key, please?

36:40.281 --> 36:42.574
It's not here, Mr. Walker.

39:55.267 --> 39:56.351
Yes.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.731
Just a minute, please.

40:41.188 --> 40:43.815
Thank you. And this.

41:25.941 --> 41:32.530
Please call Dr. Richard Waiker
at the Grand Hotel Intercontinental.

41:37.411 --> 41:39.287
It's important.

42:42.184 --> 42:43.643
- Beer.
- Tuborg, Heineken?

42:43.811 --> 42:44.852
Yes.

42:55.531 --> 42:56.531
Dede?

43:08.460 --> 43:10.378
You're looking for Dede, man?

43:12.298 --> 43:14.549
Yeah, you know him?

43:14.717 --> 43:19.345
Yeah, man.
You don't look like you know him.

43:20.222 --> 43:23.891
- What am I supposed to look like?
- Desperate, man.

43:27.104 --> 43:28.354
Yeah, well, I'm desperate.

43:28.731 --> 43:31.774
Ha-ha. So where you from, man? New York?

43:31.942 --> 43:34.986
- San Francisco.
- Much better, man.

43:35.154 --> 43:39.365
- Yeah.
- North Beach. Much, much better, man.

43:39.533 --> 43:41.200
Many places to dance.

43:51.837 --> 43:57.008
Come on, man. Buy me a Kahlua and
tell Jack about your desperate troubles.

43:57.176 --> 44:01.095
Well, all I really need, man, is Dede.

44:01.263 --> 44:05.058
All the boys and girls
are iooking for Dede these days.

44:05.225 --> 44:08.728
But Dede's been gone,
you know, two nights.

44:08.896 --> 44:10.396
Yeah, but where?

44:10.564 --> 44:13.399
Man, why not say what you're looking for?

44:13.567 --> 44:16.736
Dede not the only one
who can show you.

44:17.321 --> 44:20.657
Why don't you tell me
what I'm looking for?

44:21.241 --> 44:24.160
The white lady.

44:25.162 --> 44:27.580
Now, isn't that so?

44:29.750 --> 44:33.628
- Yes.
- Heavy. Now I see the desperate man.

44:33.796 --> 44:36.881
- Is she all right?
- Beautiful, man.

44:37.049 --> 44:40.760
Nobody has touched the iady.

44:40.928 --> 44:43.221
You don't worry, man.

44:43.389 --> 44:45.139
Follow me.

44:57.111 --> 44:59.320
- Where is she?
- Cool, man.

44:59.488 --> 45:02.573
No one has so much
as stepped on her toe.

45:02.741 --> 45:06.119
She's here, man.
And pure as the driven snow.

45:06.286 --> 45:09.789
- Hey. No, look.
- Come on, man, give it a try.

45:09.957 --> 45:12.792
Do a one-on-one and tell me if I lie.

45:13.335 --> 45:16.295
Come now, man. The nose knows.

45:19.216 --> 45:21.259
The white lady.

45:21.427 --> 45:22.802
Pure white.

45:24.471 --> 45:26.764
Good, not true?

45:28.058 --> 45:29.767
Six hundred franc.

45:29.935 --> 45:32.437
You don't need Dede, man.

45:37.818 --> 45:39.527
No.

45:45.409 --> 45:46.993
Dollars?

45:47.494 --> 45:49.954
- All right, man.
- Now, look.

45:50.122 --> 45:54.000
One more of these
for Dede's address, huh?

45:55.002 --> 45:56.335
Okay.

46:48.138 --> 46:51.182
You have a stylo, man?
Do you have a pen?

47:27.094 --> 47:29.262
Your matches.

49:25.671 --> 49:27.046
Hello?

49:38.642 --> 49:46.524
Hello?

49:50.529 --> 49:52.238
Jesus.

51:29.419 --> 51:32.129
Please call
Dr. Richard Walker, Grand Hotel...

52:05.539 --> 52:07.623
No messages, huh?

52:07.999 --> 52:11.127
Nothing here.
Let me check with the operator.

52:11.294 --> 52:12.878
Thank you.

52:15.549 --> 52:18.884
Why don't you go to the gym
and do some sports, Dr. Walker?

52:27.227 --> 52:31.063
There were a couple of calls for you,
but the man wouldn't leave a message.

52:31.481 --> 52:33.440
Son of a bitch.

52:34.568 --> 52:37.111
Would you come to my room
for a moment?

52:37.737 --> 52:39.238
Very well.

53:24.618 --> 53:27.536
- The suitcase.
- I'll call the police.

53:27.704 --> 53:29.622
No, no, no.

53:30.123 --> 53:31.832
Not now.

53:32.209 --> 53:35.127
I left a suitcase in the luggage room.
Would you get it for me?

53:35.295 --> 53:37.129
- It's gone. They took it.
- What? Who?

53:37.297 --> 53:40.257
TWA. Just after I came on duty.

53:50.518 --> 53:52.311
Shut the door.

53:54.231 --> 53:56.482
I want you to tell me what this says.

53:59.277 --> 54:01.862
"It's me. It's Michelle.

54:02.030 --> 54:04.240
I'm back. I've made a good trip.

54:05.408 --> 54:09.328
I'll see you tonight at the Biue Parrot.
Don't forget my money. I kiss you. "

54:28.515 --> 54:30.808
She's waiting for Dede.

54:33.353 --> 54:36.897
Something about her leaving a suitcase
in some locker.

54:37.065 --> 54:39.984
She's got nothing to dress in and no keys.

54:51.413 --> 54:53.289
It's her again.

54:53.456 --> 54:55.416
She's angry now.

54:57.377 --> 55:01.005
She'll wait at the Parrot until it closes,
then she'll go to his place.

55:03.049 --> 55:07.428
- What time do nightclubs close?
- Four or 6, it depends.

56:06.613 --> 56:08.113
Dede?

56:30.053 --> 56:33.472
Pardon. Listen, listen!

56:34.057 --> 56:35.182
Listen.

56:45.318 --> 56:46.735
Where is she?

56:46.903 --> 56:49.154
- Please don't kill me!
- You tell me, where is she?

56:49.322 --> 56:50.989
- Who? What do you want?
- My wife.

56:51.157 --> 56:52.658
- What wife?
- Where is my wife?

56:52.826 --> 56:55.786
Why did you kill Dede?
Why did you kill him?

56:55.995 --> 57:00.332
- I didn't kill him. I didn't kill anyone.
- What do you want from me?

57:09.092 --> 57:10.676
Look.

57:15.098 --> 57:16.640
Look familiar?

57:16.808 --> 57:19.017
- Where did you get that?
- In your suitcase.

57:19.185 --> 57:22.521
So you have it. Then pay me
what you owe me. I did my job.

57:22.689 --> 57:24.982
- Job?
- That's right. You know what I mean.

57:25.150 --> 57:29.236
No, I don't what you mean.
All I know is that I have your suitcase...

57:29.404 --> 57:31.905
...and you have my wife's.

57:32.073 --> 57:33.532
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't.

57:33.700 --> 57:36.869
You picked up the wrong suitcase
at the airport!

57:40.373 --> 57:42.916
Do you understand, huh?

57:43.084 --> 57:45.878
- Please, I must have that suitcase.
- What did you bring back?

57:46.045 --> 57:50.549
- What did they want?
- Please, we must leave here. Please. Quick.

57:50.717 --> 57:52.426
Quick, please.

58:06.983 --> 58:09.276
- You were on Fiight 862?
- Yes.

58:09.444 --> 58:12.070
- From San Francisco?
- Yes, this morning.

58:12.238 --> 58:14.656
- I want your ticket.
- What for?

58:14.824 --> 58:16.909
You want your suitcase?
I want your ticket.

58:17.076 --> 58:18.827
It's at my apartment.

58:18.995 --> 58:22.247
- Well, let's go. Where do we get a cab?
- I have a car.

58:45.480 --> 58:48.232
Here, hold this.

58:51.945 --> 58:53.904
Hey, hey.

58:54.072 --> 58:55.781
I'm not going to jump, okay?

58:55.949 --> 58:58.784
I don't have my key.
My roommate's in Bangkok.

58:58.952 --> 59:01.370
And you know where my key is,
don't you?

59:36.406 --> 59:39.324
You see? I didn't fly away.

59:44.289 --> 59:48.458
- I have to call my hotel. Telephone?
- Over there.

59:53.047 --> 59:55.215
- Where?
- There.

59:55.883 --> 59:56.925
Here.

01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:08.395
Oh, it's dead. Sonia didn't pay the biil.

01:00:08.563 --> 01:00:10.731
My roommate. Bitch!

01:00:10.898 --> 01:00:12.482
The ticket?

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:15.235
Where's the ticket?

01:00:20.074 --> 01:00:22.743
Oh. I threw it away.

01:00:23.411 --> 01:00:25.871
Maybe it's... Wait.

01:00:36.382 --> 01:00:39.718
Okay. I gave you my ticket,
you give me my suitcase.

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:44.056
Are you gonna put it back in the locker?

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:47.225
You are with the people
who followed me this morning.

01:00:47.393 --> 01:00:49.895
- I'm not with anyone.
- How'd you know about the iocker?

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:51.647
I listened to Dede's messages.

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:54.900
- You don't speak French.
- I had it translated.

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:56.485
Why is it so important?

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:59.738
I have your suitcase, you have my wife's.

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:04.785
- You put my wife's suitcase in the locker.
- Yeah. I'm sorry, I can't get it back.

01:01:04.952 --> 01:01:08.246
- What are you saying?
- The suitcase, I can't get it back anymore.

01:01:08.414 --> 01:01:11.917
I don't care about the suitcase.
I'm looking for her.

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:13.377
Who?

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:18.757
My wife, goddamn it!

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:26.139
You put my wife's suitcase in the locker
and it didn't have what they wanted in it...

01:01:26.307 --> 01:01:29.267
...but it had my wife's nametag,
our telephone number.

01:01:29.435 --> 01:01:32.646
- They came to the hotel and they took her.
- Your wife?

01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:35.357
- They kidnapped her.
- But they want my suitcase.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:38.443
- Why did they take your wife?
- When I find them, I'll ask them.

01:01:38.611 --> 01:01:40.278
Who hired you?

01:01:40.446 --> 01:01:42.197
- Dede hired me.
- Who hired Dede?

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:43.990
I don't know.

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:45.867
I don't.

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:47.994
If they knew me, they would kill me.

01:01:48.162 --> 01:01:50.914
I gave them the wrong suitcase
this morning, and instead...

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:53.083
...they killed Dede.
- No, I don't think so.

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:55.085
You think I lie?

01:01:55.294 --> 01:01:58.797
You gave them the suitcase this morning.
Dede's been dead for over one day.

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:00.382
- Who says?
- I say.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.092
How do you know? You're a doctor?

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:05.595
No corpse stinks that much
after just 12 hours. Not even Dede's.

01:02:05.763 --> 01:02:08.348
Take my word for it. Yes, I am a doctor.

01:02:09.308 --> 01:02:11.852
What did you bring back from
San Francisco? Was it dope?

01:02:12.019 --> 01:02:14.146
- No.
- Isn't that what you do, smuggie dope?

01:02:14.313 --> 01:02:16.189
Not this time.

01:02:16.649 --> 01:02:18.400
Then what was it?

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.318
All right, it was dope.

01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:23.905
- What kind? Heroin? Cocaine? Opium?
- What do you care?

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:25.657
It matters!

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:28.702
I don't know what kind and I don't care.

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:34.458
I'm very frightened. You want
your wife back, you'll get my suitcase.

01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:02.527
Is this how you got in?

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:04.404
Yeah.

01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:48.949
- Can I help you?
- Is this your wife?

01:03:49.116 --> 01:03:50.575
Yes.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.203
She seems very happy.

01:03:53.746 --> 01:03:58.625
Yes, she's happy. She's a happy person.
That's her nature.

01:04:08.135 --> 01:04:11.054
- What?
- They're following me.

01:04:11.222 --> 01:04:12.264
Who?

01:04:12.431 --> 01:04:16.518
There was a man on the plane.
I saw him on the train from the airport too.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:20.355
I lost him at the station
before I got to the locker.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:22.858
Who are they, the police?

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:25.652
- No, I don't think so.
- Then who?

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.405
Maybe the people that hired me.

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:31.408
Dede. Hired Dede.

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:37.497
Stop. I wanna talk to them. Stop!

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:52.429
- Can we go now?
- I tell you, I'm being followed.

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:56.016
Take your fingers out of your face
and drive us to the airport.

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:30.383
We have a lost bag.

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:36.348
- What sort of bag?
- A white Samsonite.

01:05:46.525 --> 01:05:49.027
Here, let me help you.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.529
Now, what has it got, a false bottom?

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.949
The suitcase.

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:58.536
Oh, Jesus Christ,
those dogs are drug-trained.

01:05:59.705 --> 01:06:01.456
It's not drugs.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:04.125
- Then what's in it?
- What do you care what's in it?

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:07.963
I don't know what's in it.
It's not drugs, that's all I know.

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:11.758
Do you want your wife back or what?

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:17.138
Then relax, be cool and just waik.

01:06:17.306 --> 01:06:18.807
We'll give them what they want.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:22.978
You wiil get your wife, I will get my money,
and everybody will be happy...

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:27.899
...except Dede.
Is there a doctor in the house?

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:30.402
Is there a doctor in the house?

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:32.737
Dickie!

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:35.824
- Ha-ha.
- Peter.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.785
We missed you.
Where were you, up in first class?

01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:40.578
No, no, no. We got here yesterday.

01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:45.125
Yesterday? You haven't found your way out
of the airport yet? I thought I was wrecked.

01:06:45.292 --> 01:06:48.253
- Ha-ha-ha.
- No, a mix-up with the bags.

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:51.089
Mix-up with the bags?

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:54.926
Listen, I'll tell you the truth, I am wrecked.
I hope I don't miss your speech.

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:58.263
- It's tomorrow, right?
- No, no, no, Peter. Today. Today.

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:00.098
- Today?
- Yeah?

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:02.183
Well, I hope you don't miss it.

01:07:02.351 --> 01:07:04.269
- Listen, have you got a match?
- Somewhere.

01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:06.980
Irwin. Irwin, look who's here.

01:07:07.606 --> 01:07:11.735
- Irwin, look at this. You remember Dick?
- Oh, yeah. How are you doing?

01:07:11.902 --> 01:07:13.403
- Hi, Irwin.
How are you?

01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:15.447
Fine, thank you. Hi, Edie.
Hi, Richard.

01:07:15.614 --> 01:07:19.159
- How are you?
- I was wondering when we'd be seeing you.

01:07:19.785 --> 01:07:22.871
- So how's Sondra?
- She's fine, Edie, fine.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:25.498
Great. So you two have been in Paris
for a day or so?

01:07:25.666 --> 01:07:28.293
- Yes.
- Well, then, when we get to the hotel...

01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:32.297
...I'm gonna wake her up and see if she
wants to come and have breakfast with me.

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:35.842
- Yes, do that.
- See if there are any new faces in her life.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.636
Listen, will you
help me with this, Dickie...

01:07:38.804 --> 01:07:40.972
...just till we get through customs?

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:43.808
Good, there we go.

01:07:43.976 --> 01:07:46.019
Got that?
Yeah, I got it.

01:07:46.937 --> 01:07:47.979
You got it?

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:57.280
Looking for your little friend?
She's gone through there already.

01:07:57.448 --> 01:07:59.824
I'm sorry. Peter, I...

01:08:57.716 --> 01:09:01.301
Here. Here, take it! Give it to the man.

01:09:22.448 --> 01:09:24.117
What kind of music do you like?

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:33.459
- I don't know, old music. Oldies, mostly.
- Yeah, me too. You like this?

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:38.173
- This is not old.
- Three, four years.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:55.148
Could you hold the wheel, please?
Because it's...

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:57.108
Thank you.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.612
Goddamn it!

01:10:00.779 --> 01:10:03.323
- What did you do that for?
- Put your hands on the wheel.

01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:06.492
That's good coke.
That was 500 francs, at least.

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:09.495
Keep your eyes on the road
and get us where we're going.

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:14.125
Jesus Christ.

01:10:27.973 --> 01:10:31.517
Thanks. You can go on home now.

01:10:31.685 --> 01:10:33.311
I got the suitcase.
I don't need your help.

01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:37.398
Unless you wanna tell me what's in it.
No, thanks.

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:40.944
You think I'm stupid? If I tell you,
then you really don't need me.

01:10:41.111 --> 01:10:42.612
You do know what's in it?

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:47.492
No, I don't. But it's my suitcase
and I will certainly tell him that.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:50.703
You have me confused...

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.456
...and I'm very hungry.

01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:08.346
There is a message for you, Dr. Walker.

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:18.773
What does he say, Dr. Aiembert?
Will you translate for me, piease?

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.858
He wants the slides for your iecture...

01:11:21.026 --> 01:11:24.028
...and he wishes you to drop them off
before lunch.

01:11:24.196 --> 01:11:27.824
- Thank you. Would you order me breakfast?
- Certainly.

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:30.785
- One or two?
- Two.

01:11:31.036 --> 01:11:32.370
Tea or coffee?

01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:35.373
Coffee.

01:11:47.219 --> 01:11:49.804
I thought my place was messy.

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:53.057
Yeah, well, there's always someone
who will do you one better, huh?

01:11:53.225 --> 01:11:55.101
How much were they paying you?

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.272
Quick. How much?

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:02.608
Well, Dede gave me first 10,000 francs...

01:12:02.776 --> 01:12:05.320
...and 15 more
because I had to pay my own ticket.

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:08.323
And when I will be back,
he will give me at least...

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.742
- How much do they owe you?
- Ten thousand francs.

01:12:10.909 --> 01:12:13.411
Well, 10,000... No, not tweive.

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:15.330
Eleven...

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:17.665
Ten thousand francs, more or iess.

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.250
What are you doing?

01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:22.003
You're in it for the money,
I'm giving you the money.

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:24.505
Then you can leave me the hell alone.

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:27.300
Two thousand dollars,
that's about 11,000 francs.

01:12:27.468 --> 01:12:28.468
It's a bit more.

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:32.180
Room service.

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:40.897
I'm sorry for all this, Dr. Walker. The police
would like to ask you some questions.

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:44.317
They won't let us clean that up
until they spoke to you.

01:12:54.119 --> 01:12:55.787
Just a moment.

01:13:09.301 --> 01:13:10.968
I take only half.

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:14.138
- Why?
- Instead of the other half...

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:16.182
...you keep me with you.
- Why?

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:19.977
I'm trusting you with my suitcase.
I stay with you until you give it to them.

01:13:20.145 --> 01:13:21.729
I don't want to end up like Dede.

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:29.821
- You better get out of here.
- No, I won't go. Piease.

01:13:29.988 --> 01:13:33.032
I'll come to your apartment
as soon as I get this straightened out.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.784
Promise?

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:38.579
Yes, I promise. Now scoot.

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:46.379
Wait. I need a little money.

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:49.132
I just gave you $1,000.

01:13:49.299 --> 01:13:52.593
That was my salary. I need for expenses.

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:10.778
- Leave her alone.
- I beg your pardon.

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:13.614
Please.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:19.203
She doesn't know anything about this.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:24.208
I'm a married man.
Can I have a little consideration here?

01:14:24.918 --> 01:14:28.004
Has Paris changed so much, huh?

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:43.436
So, doctor, has anything been taken?
Jewelry, clothing, anything?

01:14:44.354 --> 01:14:47.190
- Why?
- Well, you must have some sort of list...

01:14:47.357 --> 01:14:49.066
...in order to lodge a complaint.

01:14:49.234 --> 01:14:53.237
Well, actually,
I don't wish to lodge a complaint.

01:14:53.405 --> 01:14:54.530
Why not?

01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:57.116
Well, the fact is,
there's nothing to complain about.

01:14:57.284 --> 01:14:58.993
The truth is...

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:01.037
...I tore this place up myself.

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:04.165
My wife and I were having a fight and...

01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:06.751
...I was looking for her phone book.

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:10.713
You're right.
She does have a friend in Paris. Heh.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:14.967
Now, look, I've got...

01:15:15.135 --> 01:15:19.347
I've got an important paper to read
this morning at this medical convention.

01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:22.808
I don't want this to get out of hand.
I'm sorry for the trouble.

01:15:22.976 --> 01:15:25.353
I know it's been a lot of trouble.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:28.272
All right, doctor, we understand.

01:15:37.282 --> 01:15:38.491
By the way...

01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:43.287
...the concierge informs me you asked him
to translate a tape with messages on it.

01:15:43.455 --> 01:15:46.666
He mentioned a name, Dede.

01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:52.129
I was told that tape had important medical
information relating to the convention.

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:55.007
You wouldn't have that tape with you?

01:15:57.594 --> 01:15:59.136
No.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:04.559
Well, doctor, it may interest you to know
that my colleagues...

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:07.436
...have come across a man
called Dede Martin...

01:16:07.604 --> 01:16:10.606
...who was in serious need
of medical attention.

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:14.402
If you should find that tape,
please inform us.

01:16:14.861 --> 01:16:17.863
I hope you know what you're doing,
Dr. Walker.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.116
Have a nice day.

01:17:56.129 --> 01:17:57.922
Walker residence.

01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:59.632
What's new, sweetheart?

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:03.761
Hi, Dad.
Nothing much. Just having a party.

01:18:03.929 --> 01:18:06.263
Nothing wild, Dad, you know.

01:18:06.431 --> 01:18:09.141
Yeah, I know. Just...

01:18:09.768 --> 01:18:10.935
...you know, have a nice time.

01:18:13.271 --> 01:18:16.107
Dad, are you all right?

01:18:16.274 --> 01:18:18.275
I'm fine, honey.

01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:21.028
You and Mom weren't
having a fight or something?

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:22.655
Of course not.

01:18:22.823 --> 01:18:24.490
How's Richie?

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:27.118
You sure you. Re okay, Daddy?

01:18:27.577 --> 01:18:29.495
Absolutely.

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:31.789
What's that music you're listening to?

01:18:31.957 --> 01:18:33.541
Grace Jones.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:35.751
Why, do you like it?

01:18:36.503 --> 01:18:37.962
Just been hearing it a lot.

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:42.258
You're kidding. Sounds like you and Mom
are really having a good time.

01:18:42.426 --> 01:18:43.676
Yeah.

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.220
Go back to your party, honey.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:49.473
- I love you.
- I love you too, Daddy.

01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:52.309
Tell my mom i love her a lot.
Give her a big kiss.

01:18:52.477 --> 01:18:55.521
- Bye, honey.
- Bye, Dad.

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:25.119
Honey? Honey? Honey? Where are you?

01:25:30.208 --> 01:25:32.709
I woke up and you were gone.

01:25:32.877 --> 01:25:34.378
Come back to bed.

01:25:38.383 --> 01:25:41.468
- You guys are making so much noise.
- Who are you?

01:25:43.471 --> 01:25:46.890
- These guys friends of yours, honey?
- Not really.

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:51.436
- What the fuck are we talking about?
- Take it easy. There has been some mistake.

01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:56.441
- A crazy American.
- Damn right, there may be some mistake.

01:25:56.609 --> 01:26:00.320
Cool it. Just cool it, mister. We're only
asking the young lady a few questions.

01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:03.115
You're not asking her jack shit.
Go on, get out of here.

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:05.492
- I haven't got all day.
- I'll go on my own time.

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.494
You'll go now!

01:26:08.246 --> 01:26:11.748
Don't mess with me, man.
I am an American and I am crazy!

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:52.372
Where... Where am I, huh?

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.836
Where am I?

01:26:58.004 --> 01:26:59.046
Please.

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:50.889
- How the hell did I get here?
- My friends brought you.

01:27:57.397 --> 01:27:59.231
- She called.
- Who?

01:27:59.399 --> 01:28:00.524
- Your wife.
- Where?

01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:03.527
I called your hotel, she called twice.
She'll call again at 1.

01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:05.028
One.

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:50.741
Hello.

01:28:59.542 --> 01:29:00.584
We missed them.

01:29:05.423 --> 01:29:07.758
- Hello.
Where is it?

01:29:07.925 --> 01:29:09.301
Hello.

01:29:09.469 --> 01:29:11.261
Where is it?

01:29:12.138 --> 01:29:15.932
- Where's my wife?
- Wait.

01:29:19.103 --> 01:29:20.354
Hello?

01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:22.105
Hi, honey.

01:29:22.273 --> 01:29:23.315
Walker.

01:29:23.483 --> 01:29:25.609
I'm right here. They haven't hurt you,
have they?

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:30.113
Sondra. Sondra?

01:29:30.448 --> 01:29:32.532
All right, you've talked to her.

01:29:33.284 --> 01:29:35.285
Please don't frighten her.

01:29:35.453 --> 01:29:38.789
Don't make her scared.

01:29:38.956 --> 01:29:42.834
Don't worry, she's just a bit tired.

01:29:43.419 --> 01:29:47.631
I've got the thing you want.
What do you want me to do?

01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:50.759
Yellow level at the Beaubourg Parking.

01:29:50.927 --> 01:29:52.636
Wait, wait, wait. Say it again.

01:29:52.804 --> 01:29:56.431
Beaubourg Parking, yellow level.
You got it?

01:29:56.599 --> 01:30:00.143
- Bring the statue, doctor.
- When?

01:30:00.311 --> 01:30:03.563
Now. And, doctor...

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:05.899
...don't be stupid.

01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:10.362
Or else beautiful Mrs. Walker
goes bye-bye.

01:30:55.408 --> 01:30:57.868
- What is it?
- I don't know.

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:04.499
Have you got some tape?

01:31:37.742 --> 01:31:40.076
I want you to take this
and go behind that truck.

01:31:40.244 --> 01:31:44.581
- And don't come out until I tell you.
- Okay. I'm scared. Are you?

01:31:44.749 --> 01:31:46.583
I'm scared shitless. Go on.

01:31:48.085 --> 01:31:53.089
In French, it's good luck to say "merde. "
You're not supposed to answer.

01:33:02.493 --> 01:33:05.579
- Lady Liberty?
- Let my wife out first!

01:33:05.746 --> 01:33:08.498
- Ah!
No! No! Stop.

01:33:08.666 --> 01:33:11.918
I'll get the girl, she's got it. Michelle!

01:33:15.631 --> 01:33:17.257
Michelle!

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:21.219
Come on.

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:30.562
- Come on!
- First tell them to give me my bread.

01:33:31.188 --> 01:33:34.232
What are you doing? Don't do this.
Bring it here. Give it to them!

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.192
No! Never!

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:38.028
Michelle, watch out!
- Go!

01:33:42.533 --> 01:33:44.492
Wait! Take it! Take it!

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:14.606
Assholes!

01:35:37.982 --> 01:35:40.692
Blue BMW...

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:43.153
...four doors, license plate number:

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:46.614
1068...

01:35:46.782 --> 01:35:50.201
...PD92.

01:35:50.369 --> 01:35:54.247
You got it?
They had a knife at her throat.

01:35:55.624 --> 01:35:58.126
Hello? You hear what I'm saying to you?

01:35:58.294 --> 01:36:01.504
Yes, yeah, yeah.
A knife at her throat. All right, go on.

01:36:01.672 --> 01:36:04.716
Go on where, go on? Goddamn it!
My wife is being heid for ransom!

01:36:04.884 --> 01:36:06.676
Yeah, I know. I. Ve got that too.

01:36:06.844 --> 01:36:08.136
But let's see now...

01:36:08.304 --> 01:36:11.181
...they were after this electronic gizmo...?
- A Krytron.

01:36:11.348 --> 01:36:13.641
Yeah, Krytron. Whatever, whatever.

01:36:13.809 --> 01:36:18.146
Now, what about this other gang,
the one that came along in the Peugeot?

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:24.068
Williams, the other gang was on foot.

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:28.573
The guy in the Peugeot was with them,
the kidnappers.

01:36:28.741 --> 01:36:31.701
He's dead. He's in his car
on the Rue de Rivoli.

01:36:32.077 --> 01:36:34.871
I'm not quite sure
what you mean by '. Them,.' doctor.

01:36:35.039 --> 01:36:38.249
Oh, hold on a minute. Please excuse me,
I gotta take this call.

01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:56.643
- Hello? Doctor?
- Yes.

01:36:57.353 --> 01:36:59.979
What number are you calling from?

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:02.732
How would I know what number?

01:37:05.736 --> 01:37:08.905
I'm in a cafe. The Paris Midi.

01:37:09.114 --> 01:37:11.699
Pa... How do you spell that?

01:37:11.867 --> 01:37:13.451
How do you s...

01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:17.747
With an S for shithead!

01:37:51.615 --> 01:37:53.783
Those guys are supposed to be loaded.

01:37:53.951 --> 01:37:57.453
Look at this, 200 francs.
Would you believe it?

01:37:57.621 --> 01:37:58.955
What is this?
- His wallet.

01:37:59.123 --> 01:38:01.291
- Whose wallet?
- The dead guy.

01:38:01.458 --> 01:38:02.792
You took his wallet?

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:06.629
I wasn't supposed to?
He doesn't need it anymore.

01:38:07.631 --> 01:38:09.465
Let me see.

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:19.601
Born in Cyprus.

01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:21.769
Look at this.

01:38:24.648 --> 01:38:26.816
What is this?
- It's a nightclub.

01:38:28.694 --> 01:38:32.322
- You know it?
- Sure. It's for old jerks and really square.

01:38:32.489 --> 01:38:36.159
It's full of rich Arabs. Greeks too.

01:38:36.368 --> 01:38:39.412
- You've been there?
- Once, Dede Martin took me.

01:38:41.999 --> 01:38:45.168
- Mm.
- Waiter?

01:38:52.134 --> 01:38:55.428
Well, Dr. Walker, I must admit,
it iooks iike you were right.

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:57.138
About what?

01:38:57.681 --> 01:39:00.350
- Is that the...?
- Yes.

01:39:08.567 --> 01:39:09.984
Doug.

01:39:10.694 --> 01:39:14.822
Well, you can taik in front of Michelle.
She knows more about this than you do.

01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:17.825
All right, who's got my wife?

01:39:17.993 --> 01:39:20.578
- We believe they're Arabs.
- Oh, that's news.

01:39:20.746 --> 01:39:24.666
We're playing catch-up ball here, doctor.
All we know is they're Arab agents.

01:39:25.209 --> 01:39:27.794
- Have you ever heard of Krytron before?
- No.

01:39:27.962 --> 01:39:29.629
Must admit, neither had I.

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:33.883
It's an eiectronic triggering device.

01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:36.970
A miniature, high-performance switch...

01:39:37.137 --> 01:39:41.265
...capabie of withstanding
severe shock and vibration.

01:39:41.433 --> 01:39:42.767
What's it for?

01:39:42.935 --> 01:39:44.560
It's used in missile separation...

01:39:44.728 --> 01:39:48.356
...and for triggering
the detonation of nuclear devices.

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.445
This thing sets off atomic bombs?

01:39:54.613 --> 01:39:57.407
That's what they're after.
- Stolen from the manufacturer.

01:39:57.574 --> 01:39:59.492
We were lucky
it was found by a U.S. Citizen.

01:40:01.036 --> 01:40:04.247
I should have asked
for 20,000 francs at least.

01:40:04.415 --> 01:40:07.959
- Who were the two guys in her apartment?
- Probably on our side.

01:40:08.127 --> 01:40:10.086
"Our side"? Your side.

01:40:10.254 --> 01:40:14.841
We're doing everything we can to help.
We put pressure on the Minister of Interior.

01:40:15.009 --> 01:40:19.095
We brought in Interpol. I've already sent
a telex off to the State Department.

01:40:19.263 --> 01:40:24.308
Now, I think priority one is
to get this to a safe location.

01:40:24.601 --> 01:40:27.729
- And where might that be?
- To the embassy.

01:40:27.896 --> 01:40:29.897
This is Sondra's iife.

01:40:30.065 --> 01:40:33.109
The device
doesn't beiong to you, Dr. Walker.

01:40:33.277 --> 01:40:38.031
- It doesn't belong to you either.
- It belongs to me. I brought it over.

01:40:38.282 --> 01:40:40.950
Hey! Hey! Bitch!

01:41:20.908 --> 01:41:23.826
- It's okay?
- Yeah.

01:41:23.994 --> 01:41:27.163
Just don't touch my face.

01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:34.504
- Jesus.
Michelle! Michelle!

01:41:46.266 --> 01:41:50.353
What about this?
We can't take this with us.

01:42:15.879 --> 01:42:17.880
You iook nice.

01:42:54.209 --> 01:42:58.504
- How will I know whether you'll take this?
- Of course, American Express.

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:00.256
Do me a favor, go and see.

01:43:00.424 --> 01:43:04.093
- No problem, I assure you.
- I insist.

01:43:15.272 --> 01:43:17.815
I can't stand this music.

01:43:30.287 --> 01:43:32.413
I'll be damned!

01:43:32.706 --> 01:43:36.459
Dr. Metlaoui, Cairo Cardiology
Convention, 1981. You remember?

01:43:36.627 --> 01:43:38.461
Oh, yes. How are you? Nice to see you.

01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:40.671
This is him. This is Dr. Richard Walker.

01:43:41.423 --> 01:43:45.676
We were all waiting for your lecture today.
Ha-ha-ha. Let me introduce you.

01:43:45.844 --> 01:43:51.766
Dr. Alloullou, Dr. Bouzid, Professor Cherif.
Best surgeon in Tunisia.

01:43:53.018 --> 01:43:55.978
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- What happened?

01:43:56.146 --> 01:44:00.233
Did you have some trouble or did you
have too much champagne like us? Ha-ha.

01:44:00.651 --> 01:44:01.734
- We dance?
- Yes.

01:44:01.902 --> 01:44:02.944
I see.

01:46:31.802 --> 01:46:34.011
We take American Express.

01:46:34.179 --> 01:46:36.972
I've got something else too.

01:46:39.476 --> 01:46:41.268
- Where is he?
- Dead.

01:46:41.436 --> 01:46:45.314
Those Israeii dogs.
It's most regretted you were followed.

01:46:45.482 --> 01:46:47.483
It's more likely you were followed.

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.486
We still have your wife, doctor.

01:46:51.613 --> 01:46:54.323
And I still have what you want.

01:46:54.491 --> 01:46:57.326
Then I propose another exchange.

01:46:58.829 --> 01:47:02.832
And this time,
I decide how it's gonna be done.

01:47:02.999 --> 01:47:05.709
- You'll hear from me.
- Very well.

01:47:05.877 --> 01:47:09.672
- So everybody is in your hands, doctor.
- That's right.

01:48:10.484 --> 01:48:13.486
Yes?
Are you ready?

01:48:14.196 --> 01:48:15.738
Yes.

01:48:18.033 --> 01:48:19.408
Five a. m.

01:48:20.577 --> 01:48:24.497
On the bridge by the Statue of Liberty.

01:48:24.998 --> 01:48:26.916
I understand.

01:49:19.719 --> 01:49:21.887
You broke your word.

01:49:22.138 --> 01:49:24.348
You were to keep me with you.

01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:28.936
I'm sorry. It's dangerous.

01:49:31.022 --> 01:49:33.774
I don't need your money, Waiker.

01:49:40.448 --> 01:49:42.324
It's cold.

01:50:21.197 --> 01:50:22.531
Hold it there!

01:50:26.453 --> 01:50:28.370
Let's see it.

01:50:39.049 --> 01:50:40.049
Give it to the girl.

01:50:44.721 --> 01:50:48.474
- She comes alone.
- My wife first!

01:51:20.423 --> 01:51:23.300
Give me my money or I'll throw
your fucking thing in the river.

01:51:24.177 --> 01:51:27.346
- Money? What money?
- I still wasn't paid.

01:51:27.889 --> 01:51:29.723
I don't have any money.

01:51:30.266 --> 01:51:31.266
Oh, really?

01:51:31.434 --> 01:51:32.768
Hold it there!

01:51:32.936 --> 01:51:35.562
- How much?
- Ten thousand francs.

01:51:35.730 --> 01:51:37.398
- Quick.
- All right.

01:51:42.946 --> 01:51:44.154
Stop!

01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:16.854
No.

01:52:28.783 --> 01:52:30.325
Go!

01:52:30.493 --> 01:52:34.163
Ah!
Just go!

01:53:58.581 --> 01:54:02.960
- I'm cold, Walker.
- You'll be fine, baby. You'll be fine.

01:54:03.127 --> 01:54:05.045
You'll be all right.

01:55:08.192 --> 01:55:11.320
This? This is what you want?

01:55:53.988 --> 01:55:55.280
I love you, baby.

01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:59.034
I love you.
