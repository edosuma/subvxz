Oh. O‐oh! Oh!

20:48.080 --> 20:50.833
Here. Have a seat.
Warmed it up for you.

20:51.625 --> 20:52.960
And just so you know,

20:52.960 --> 20:55.838
as far as friends go,
you cannot have picked...

20:55.838 --> 20:56.964
I'll go now.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.092
Hey, Syd!

21:02.511 --> 21:03.804
I wanna thank you.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.140
What? Why?

21:06.140 --> 21:08.142
For being such
an awesome mentor.

21:08.476 --> 21:10.770
You were always
there for me no matter what.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.774
I know it might
seem weird, but...

21:15.024 --> 21:16.525
But what?

21:17.193 --> 21:19.361
I kinda think of you
as a big sister.

21:20.362 --> 21:23.783
Aw.
That's the least weird thing
I've ever heard.

21:24.158 --> 21:26.702
‐Are‐are you crying?
‐No, it's just the chemicals.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.795
Hey, Syd. Are you okay?

21:35.795 --> 21:38.798
Never better!
Lucy made a friend,

21:38.798 --> 21:41.467
and she even called me
her big sister.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.804
That's great.
At least one of us
made a good mentor.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.305
What happened with Jordan?

21:46.305 --> 21:48.891
You probably couldn't tell,
but she didn't need me.

21:48.891 --> 21:50.392
Sorry, Olive.

21:51.227 --> 21:54.480
Olive! Thank goodness!
I got a big problem!

21:54.480 --> 21:56.357
Heidi likes Ryan,
but Ryan likes me,

21:56.357 --> 21:58.400
and I don't even like Ryan,
but now Heidi's mad at me!

21:58.400 --> 22:00.236
What am I gonna do?

22:00.861 --> 22:02.738
Aw, poor thing.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.074
Don't worry.
We're gonna figure
this out together.

22:08.244 --> 22:11.705
She needs me! She needs me!

22:11.956 --> 22:14.542
She's just lucky
she has you to talk to.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.961
Hey.
That's what mentors do.

22:24.301 --> 22:25.803
Mom, Mom!

22:25.803 --> 22:28.973
I got a "A" on my science test!
Can you believe it?

22:28.973 --> 22:30.766
Not until I see it.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.353
Oh yes! That's an "A"!

22:34.353 --> 22:36.355
Congratulations, Max.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.566
Thanks, Mom.
Turns out Leo was right.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.151
Separating us ended up
being a good thing.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.697
Maybe goofing off
in class isn't the key
to a bright future.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.115
Now you're thinking
about your future? Ooh!

22:46.115 --> 22:48.200
I'm gonna leave
before you ruin it.

23:03.007 --> 23:05.593
Not standing up for you
was unforgivable.

23:05.593 --> 23:08.012
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You made a mistake,
you sided with Virmani,

23:08.012 --> 23:10.806
you ruined my life,
but I forgive you.

23:12.975 --> 23:15.603
Hey. You got an "A"
on your science test?

23:15.603 --> 23:16.937
So I was right!

23:16.937 --> 23:19.690
Us being in separate classes
was better for you, too!

23:20.107 --> 23:22.735
So I have nothing
to apologize for?

23:23.193 --> 23:25.779
Nope!
But thanks for the burger!
