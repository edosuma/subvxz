WEBVTT

00:11.220 --> 00:14.473
Why don't we take off this weekend,
head down the coast?

00:19.520 --> 00:20.521
What?

00:22.189 --> 00:24.858
You always say this city
has everything you could ever want.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.235
It does.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.863
But, you know,
if you'd rather score points

00:29.863 --> 00:31.114
than spend the weekend with me,

00:31.114 --> 00:33.116
I'll post the offer
on the embassy noticeboard.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.202
No. No, I'll come.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.206
Of course I'll come.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.014
I need to shower
and finish making the hummus.

00:56.014 --> 01:00.310
This is Istanbul.
You can buy pretty good hummus.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.938
I'm immersing myself in the cuisine.

01:30.716 --> 01:31.717
What are you doing?

01:35.679 --> 01:37.097
- I was just looking--
- For what?

01:38.140 --> 01:39.725
Something of yours?

01:39.725 --> 01:41.727
Why would that be on my desk?

01:45.355 --> 01:46.565
What are you looking for?

01:49.526 --> 01:51.778
A sensitive file
they think you're about to leak.

01:59.745 --> 02:02.789
Okay. What's supposed to be in this file?

02:02.789 --> 02:05.083
I wasn't told. Just the name.

02:06.502 --> 02:07.503
"Footprint."

02:08.586 --> 02:12.841
And you didn't ask any questions?
Just went along with it?

02:14.510 --> 02:16.428
You make a terrible spy, by the way.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.055
This isn't easy for me.

02:18.055 --> 02:21.183
No? Seems it.

02:22.267 --> 02:25.604
Come around here and fuck me,
then go through my stuff.

02:25.604 --> 02:26.730
Pretty sweet assignment.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.815
I couldn't turn them down.
They don't know about us.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.279
Alison. Ali. No, wait!

02:40.702 --> 02:41.703
Al.

02:44.248 --> 02:45.332
Did you find it?

02:47.501 --> 02:48.919
You know I had to look.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.754
Thought you cared about me.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.172
I do.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.966
I really do.

02:53.966 --> 02:54.925
Get the fuck out.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.385
Please let me make this right.

02:59.471 --> 03:00.556
Now.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.250
It's me. We need to bring it forward.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.002
Heading there now.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.001
To KadikÃ¶y.

04:11.001 --> 04:11.960
Yes, ma'am.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.267
Follow that boat.

05:00.259 --> 05:02.261
Let's turn right in front of the tanker.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.596
I can't get that close.

05:04.596 --> 05:09.893
500 more if you lose the boat behind.

05:19.069 --> 05:22.155
- Cut across the tanker now!
- No way!

06:50.035 --> 06:51.036
Hey!

07:00.462 --> 07:01.839
Oh, fuck!

08:00.898 --> 08:01.899
Damn.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.269
Get it out there into the world.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.171
No! Ali, stop! Wait! What?

09:13.387 --> 09:14.513
Ali!

09:17.474 --> 09:18.642
Alison!

09:22.020 --> 09:23.146
Ali, where are you?

09:28.318 --> 09:29.319
Ali!

09:34.867 --> 09:35.951
Where are you?

11:06.208 --> 11:07.209
River!

11:11.505 --> 11:12.965
They need that last box.

11:12.965 --> 11:14.883
- Got it.
- Have you checked it?

11:14.883 --> 11:16.176
Yep.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.845
It doesn't look like it.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.179
It's still got the old tape.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.390
Yeah, well, I stuck it down again.
I'm being green.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.477
Did you itemize it?

11:25.477 --> 11:27.896
What does it matter?
No one's gonna read this stuff ever again.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.982
Yes, but we're still
supposed to itemize it.

11:29.982 --> 11:30.899
It's pointless.

11:31.775 --> 11:35.571
These files are all Ringo-level,
the lowest-grade record the Park has.

11:36.238 --> 11:37.489
Shows you what they think of us.

11:37.489 --> 11:40.534
They'll think a lot less of us if we can't
even do this simple job properly.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.996
Catherine, this is the equivalent
of filling a storage unit full of crap

11:43.996 --> 11:46.290
for your kids to sort through
once you've died.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.333
We've been asked to do it,
so we should do it well.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.544
You need to get back up those stairs
and itemize it.

11:50.544 --> 11:53.005
No, not happening.
And plus, the van needs to go.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.883
I'd rather the box went tomorrow,
when you've been through the contents.

11:55.883 --> 11:56.967
Nope.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.303
This isn't even taped up properly.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.764
It's fine. Just forget it.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.142
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait!

12:06.435 --> 12:08.979
- Jesus! Wait!
- Oh, God.

12:23.285 --> 12:24.286
River?

12:24.286 --> 12:26.788
Yeah, I'm just getting another box.

12:53.899 --> 12:58.529
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but should he be in here?

12:58.529 --> 13:01.949
- Who?
- Well, the-- the homeless man.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.033
Homeless man?

13:05.744 --> 13:10.499
- He has an appointment.
- He's making-- Odors.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.626
It's upsetting my wife.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.878
There's not much I can do
about that, I'm afraid.

13:27.266 --> 13:30.811
It's my colon. Terminal.

13:37.276 --> 13:38.485
There's no need for that, Jackson.

13:39.528 --> 13:42.114
You know, perks of the job.

13:42.114 --> 13:44.867
- Has it really been a year?
- It has.

13:45.909 --> 13:50.330
My balls are hanging a bit lower.
But apart from that, all good.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.752
- How's the drinking?
- Fine, thanks.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.713
No. I mean, how much are you drinking?

13:57.713 --> 14:00.382
I don't know. Two or three bottles a week.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.968
- Wine?
- Whiskey.

14:03.969 --> 14:06.513
- I thought we talked about this.
- It doesn't affect my work.

14:06.513 --> 14:10.267
And besides, I've got fuck all to do,
which is well within my comfort zone.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.518
This is a Service medical.

14:11.518 --> 14:15.105
There's a limit to the amount of units
you can consume a week.

14:16.732 --> 14:18.358
- What's the limit?
- Fourteen.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.903
- Put that then.
- I'm not allowed to lie.

14:20.903 --> 14:25.741
You're not lying. I am.
I told you 14. Put that.

14:30.412 --> 14:32.998
- Smoking?
- I quit.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.042
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:35.042 --> 14:38.295
I haven't had one for--
Twenty-seven minutes.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.841
By some miracle,
your blood tests came back okay.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.719
There you go.
You see, I'm a fucking titan.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.972
I'll just take your blood pressure.

14:53.227 --> 14:54.770
Then we'll get you on the treadmill.

14:56.146 --> 15:00.776
If you put me on a treadmill,
you'll be done for manslaughter.

15:00.776 --> 15:02.569
You need to do some light exercise,

15:02.569 --> 15:05.030
an hour's walk a day,
and watch what you eat.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.533
I think the time has passed for that,
don't you?

15:08.283 --> 15:12.371
Dodgy vindaloo and some steep steps
should finish me off.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.749
Can't think of a better way to go.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.879
I'll finish that box in the morning.

15:20.879 --> 15:23.590
- And do the others properly?
- Yeah.

15:23.590 --> 15:27.594
Maybe you should try embracing
the task rather than fighting it.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.472
Embracing it might be a bit of a stretch,
but you know, I'll just--

15:30.472 --> 15:31.682
You know, it's quite tiring,

15:31.682 --> 15:34.184
- having to chivy you along like this.
- Well, then don't.

15:34.685 --> 15:37.187
Stop being such a martyr about it.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.023
I'll see you tomorrow.

15:42.568 --> 15:45.112
Wait. Catherine, I didn't mean that.

15:51.535 --> 15:52.536
Sorry.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.205
No, you're fine!

16:39.958 --> 16:41.668
At this point in the meeting,

16:41.668 --> 16:44.630
we ask if there's any newcomers
who'd like to share.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.928
- My name's John.
- Hello, John.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.138
Still an alcoholic.

16:55.098 --> 16:57.142
Still a newcomer.

16:59.228 --> 17:01.021
Still only counting days.

17:01.647 --> 17:05.651
Keep waiting for the next day
to be easier than the last, but...

17:07.819 --> 17:09.988
I don't expect that's going to happen.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.325
Keep coming back.

17:14.952 --> 17:18.288
Are there any other newcomers
who would like to speak?

17:48.902 --> 17:50.112
Evening, ma'am.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.823
Your car is waiting to take you
to the off-site file storage facility.

17:52.823 --> 17:54.241
I'm going to the agency meeting.

17:54.241 --> 17:57.035
I've been told there's been
a slight change to your schedule.

17:57.035 --> 17:57.953
By whom?

18:09.798 --> 18:11.133
Lamb doner please, mate.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.051
Regular or large?

18:14.553 --> 18:15.387
Large.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.472
No, make it two regulars.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.434
- Fourteen pounds.
- Fourteen.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.644
Chili sauce for the kebabs?

18:22.644 --> 18:24.688
Yeah. Enough so I can't taste the meat.

18:25.522 --> 18:26.523
Three doners, mate.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.108
- And some beers.
- No beers.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.569
I'll go grab some beers
from the offie, yeah?

18:32.112 --> 18:33.405
I'll be outside.

18:56.470 --> 18:58.764
- It is Catherine, right?
- Yes.

18:58.764 --> 19:02.476
Do you have a moment?
I just wanted to ask some advice.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.853
- From me?
- Yeah.

19:04.853 --> 19:06.647
No worries if not. It's just,

19:07.773 --> 19:11.860
when I was talking away in there,
it seemed like you were really listening.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.488
Thank you. I try to.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.449
What was it you wanted to ask?

19:18.408 --> 19:22.162
Well, I think it's probably time
I got a sponsor.

19:25.082 --> 19:25.958
Cheers.

19:36.677 --> 19:41.640
Thank you for giving me your time.
It's not the friendliest city.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.476
It's changed a lot since I was last here.

19:45.727 --> 19:46.895
When was that?

19:47.479 --> 19:49.022
Ten years or so.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.315
And what brought you back?

19:53.527 --> 19:54.403
I--

19:56.280 --> 19:57.406
I lost someone.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.367
Couldn't stay where I was.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.910
Memories, you know?

20:03.161 --> 20:06.456
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry I was--
- No, it's fine.

20:07.124 --> 20:10.335
Hey, I could have lied,
saved you the awkwardness,

20:10.335 --> 20:13.964
but the drinking started when they died.

20:13.964 --> 20:17.217
I blamed myself, internalized it,

20:18.177 --> 20:21.013
and part of my recovery has been
about being open about it.

20:21.013 --> 20:23.557
You know, dealing with it, not burying it.

20:24.766 --> 20:25.851
You can push things away,

20:25.851 --> 20:28.854
but sooner or later,
you have to deal with them.

20:30.856 --> 20:32.524
And secrets will always come out.

20:34.359 --> 20:36.486
There will always be a reckoning.

20:42.576 --> 20:45.704
Decaf latte and an extra-strong cappuccino
with extra chocolate.

20:45.704 --> 20:47.289
I think I'll get mine to take away.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.291
What? No.
I'm really enjoying talking to you.

20:49.291 --> 20:52.169
- I have an early start tomorrow.
- Oh, come on. You can't leave.

20:52.169 --> 20:54.004
We haven't talked about
what we came here to talk about.

20:54.838 --> 20:55.964
Oh, yes. A sponsor.

20:55.964 --> 20:58.675
No. Jackson Lamb.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.063
Excuse me.

21:54.064 --> 21:57.150
Sorry. I'm lost.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.403
Could you show me the way
to the North Circular?

22:00.195 --> 22:02.823
I'm headed that way.
If you give me a lift, I can direct you.

22:02.823 --> 22:04.324
You're headed somewhere else.

23:40.170 --> 23:41.630
Stay the fuck back.

23:45.843 --> 23:46.844
Madam.

23:48.595 --> 23:52.182
Second Desk in the house.
Outside the house-- Not a house.

23:52.766 --> 23:55.978
A series of decommissioned bunkers
from the Cold War.

23:55.978 --> 23:58.564
If a bomb dropped, this is where the Queen
and the government would have hidden out.

23:58.564 --> 24:01.066
Yes, I know. I decommissioned it.

24:01.066 --> 24:03.443
And recommissioned it
as a document storage facility.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.695
Thank you, my creator.

24:04.695 --> 24:06.947
- I see you'd like the tour.
- Well, that's why I'm here.

24:06.947 --> 24:10.200
"Step into my parlor,"
said the spider to the fly.

24:10.200 --> 24:14.288
It's not a parlor. I'm not a spider.
I'm Douglas. You're not a fly.

24:14.288 --> 24:17.791
Can you just think before you speak,
then perhaps not speak?

24:18.792 --> 24:21.795
Message received and understood.

24:21.795 --> 24:23.046
But not yet applied.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.398
You look like you could use company.

24:44.109 --> 24:48.906
And you've been here for 37 minutes now,
and you haven't once checked the door.

24:55.829 --> 24:56.955
You don't wanna talk?

24:59.666 --> 25:00.667
Fine.

25:03.462 --> 25:05.255
I'll just sit here and enjoy the view.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.309
I'm in futures, by the way.
Don't worry, I'm not a fortune teller.

25:18.101 --> 25:20.062
Although you have just met
a handsome stranger.

25:25.108 --> 25:29.112
Futures is a derivative contract
to buy or sell a commodity

25:29.112 --> 25:33.242
at a later point in time.
I'm kind of a commodity of a--

25:33.242 --> 25:37.246
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have two glasses
of wine, which I will pay for myself,

25:37.246 --> 25:40.123
and if you're still here when I'm done,
you can come home with me.

25:40.123 --> 25:42.918
But in the meantime,
please just shut the fuck up.

25:44.503 --> 25:45.546
Yeah.

26:01.061 --> 26:02.813
- You got 30 minutes.
- Look, I've got a problem.

26:02.813 --> 26:04.314
Yeah, so have I.

26:04.314 --> 26:06.483
I was heading out to get off my face
and pick up a stray fuck.

26:06.483 --> 26:08.068
I'm being blackmailed.

26:10.070 --> 26:11.697
- Over a debt?
- No.

26:11.697 --> 26:12.781
What then?

26:13.532 --> 26:15.158
Over the fact that I'm gambling again.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.287
- They know you're Service?
- Yeah.

26:18.287 --> 26:19.621
So you're compromised?

26:20.205 --> 26:21.206
Who by?

26:21.874 --> 26:24.751
Jesus. FSB? North Korean?

26:25.252 --> 26:26.295
Or is it organized crime?

26:26.295 --> 26:27.796
What's up, Ho-bros?

26:29.965 --> 26:33.760
Ho-bros. You're my bros,
but you're also hoboes.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.304
You're gonna want a drink for this.

26:35.304 --> 26:38.182
Wha-- Ho's the one blackmailing you?

26:39.266 --> 26:40.434
It's not blackmail.

26:40.434 --> 26:43.061
I asked him for a simple favor.
He refused.

26:43.061 --> 26:46.815
So I applied a little gentle pressure
to set him on the path of righteousness.

26:47.357 --> 26:49.526
You are such a piece of shit, Ho.

26:49.526 --> 26:52.237
- You threatened to get him thrown out?
- They can't throw me out for gambling.

26:52.237 --> 26:55.949
It's a-- It's an addiction, so,
you know, mental health issue.

26:56.742 --> 26:57.951
Well, so who was he gonna tell?

26:59.703 --> 27:00.537
His missus.

27:00.537 --> 27:03.498
He promised her he'd stop gambling,
but someone has

27:03.498 --> 27:05.042
- a naughty online poker habit.
- Shut up.

27:05.042 --> 27:09.087
- What has this got to do with me?
- Did he not tell you?

27:10.088 --> 27:12.716
The price of my silence was for him
to deliver you.

27:13.300 --> 27:16.595
- But I'm not his to deliver.
- Look, I'll get you a drink, all right?

27:16.595 --> 27:18.347
I'll get the fucking drinks
with your money.

27:20.682 --> 27:23.101
Give me a Jack Daniel's and Coke.

27:23.101 --> 27:28.106
As you can see, we have ample storage
for George and Ringo-level files,

27:28.106 --> 27:31.276
the Paul and John-level
still stored at the Park.

27:32.152 --> 27:36.448
Now, I find the nomenclature
just a little harsh.

27:36.448 --> 27:38.158
Big George Harrison fan.

27:38.158 --> 27:41.662
I went through a bit of
a transcendental phase myself, actually,

27:41.662 --> 27:46.583
which did result in a minor breakdown,
but here I am.

27:48.877 --> 27:53.799
Molly Doran asked me to double-check
that shelf 27 arrived safely.

27:53.799 --> 27:55.717
It was a last-minute addition, apparently.

27:56.760 --> 28:00.764
Molly Doran asked a question of me?
She is a legend.

28:00.764 --> 28:04.226
The queen of filing. My secret crush.

28:04.226 --> 28:06.770
Well, next time,
I'll bring a signed photograph.

28:06.770 --> 28:08.021
What should I tell her?

28:08.605 --> 28:12.818
That it has indeed arrived safely,
and it is resting on my sweet bosom.

28:14.736 --> 28:15.988
Just figuratively.

28:16.613 --> 28:18.407
It is up here.
You can view it, if you like.

28:18.407 --> 28:21.076
No need. How do I get out?

28:21.076 --> 28:24.371
It is actually quicker to finish the tour
than go back the way we came.

28:24.371 --> 28:26.248
Just point me to the nearest exit.

28:32.754 --> 28:35.215
- What do you want from me?
- Louisa.

28:36.967 --> 28:39.094
- You think she's got the diamond?
- What?

28:39.094 --> 28:43.599
357 diamonds spilled out over the roof
when Louisa nearly got shot.

28:43.599 --> 28:44.808
They only recovered 356.

28:44.808 --> 28:48.353
Duffy's obsessed with finding it.
Otherwise, his Dogs stay under suspicion.

28:48.353 --> 28:50.314
- Yeah, you've got it.
- No, I haven't.

28:50.898 --> 28:53.317
Well, not anymore. You'll have gambled it.

28:54.526 --> 28:55.777
I didn't take it.

28:55.777 --> 28:59.823
The only other person up there
was Catherine. No way was it her.

28:59.823 --> 29:03.243
Well, if this isn't about Louisa
having the diamond, then what is it about?

29:06.955 --> 29:08.332
Oh, my God.

29:08.332 --> 29:11.335
Hottest girl in the office
should be with the hottest boy.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.170
But it ain't happening.

29:14.254 --> 29:15.756
Is that why you dyed your hair?

29:15.756 --> 29:19.301
What? No. She dyed hers to copy me.

29:19.301 --> 29:22.596
She's sending out the Bat-Signal
but treating me like the Joker.

29:23.889 --> 29:26.600
You really can't work out
why this isn't happening yourself?

29:26.600 --> 29:29.978
Obviously she's still hung up on Harper.

29:29.978 --> 29:31.897
But he was killed, cremated and scattered.

29:31.897 --> 29:35.526
She-- Look, she needs to move on.
You need to set her straight.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.695
She's on the downslopes as it is.

29:38.695 --> 29:40.322
It breaks my heart to watch good fruit

29:40.322 --> 29:42.157
- rotting on the branch.
- Jesus.

29:48.497 --> 29:50.958
That is what you should have done
in the first place.

29:51.625 --> 29:52.543
Get me another drink.

29:53.126 --> 29:54.753
I'll get you drinks for life.

30:45.179 --> 30:48.390
Cookies and cream. My favorite.
Must be a sign.

30:48.390 --> 30:50.309
You just help yourself
to people's ice cream, do you?

30:50.309 --> 30:51.518
Excuse me?

30:51.518 --> 30:54.438
- Put the ice cream back.
- I'll buy you some more.

30:54.438 --> 30:56.523
I can buy my own ice cream,
thank you very mu--

30:56.523 --> 30:57.608
You know what? Get out.

30:59.276 --> 31:00.485
Fuck off now.

31:07.868 --> 31:09.912
- Fucking weird.
- And you're a shit fuck.

32:12.099 --> 32:13.517
Fuck's sake.

32:24.778 --> 32:27.865
Standish! Soap!

32:39.918 --> 32:41.086
Standish!

33:14.620 --> 33:15.996
- Good morning.
- Morning.

33:16.872 --> 33:17.956
How long have you been here?

33:20.542 --> 33:21.627
About an hour.

33:21.627 --> 33:22.794
Why?

33:22.794 --> 33:24.588
Trying to make it up to Catherine,

33:24.588 --> 33:27.174
'cause I think I really managed
to piss her off yesterday.

33:27.674 --> 33:29.510
Oh, yeah?
What does pissed-off Catherine look like?

33:30.469 --> 33:32.846
Exactly the same, which makes it worse.

33:33.764 --> 33:34.765
She'll be fine.

33:36.850 --> 33:39.269
I told her to stop being such a martyr.

33:40.979 --> 33:42.314
Okay. Then she won't be fine.

33:43.482 --> 33:44.525
Right. Why?

33:45.108 --> 33:49.238
Because she keeps this place going.
She is selfless.

33:49.238 --> 33:52.074
And you basically implied that she did it
to take the moral high ground.

33:56.161 --> 33:59.331
Well, no, I didn't mean it like that.
It was an offhand kind of thing.

34:00.332 --> 34:01.542
Offhand? Even worse.

34:01.542 --> 34:03.001
This isn't making me feel better,
by the way.

34:03.001 --> 34:04.628
- What are you looking at?
- Lamb.

34:05.212 --> 34:07.673
Looks like he's trying
to make a cup of something.

34:09.382 --> 34:11.592
I didn't know he knew how to do that.

34:12.553 --> 34:14.888
If he's doing anything for himself,
something's up.

34:15.514 --> 34:16.974
Well, let's film it then.

34:18.183 --> 34:19.810
He might end up burning himself.

34:19.810 --> 34:21.353
Everything okay?

34:21.978 --> 34:24.313
Go see if she went to her AA meeting.

34:24.982 --> 34:26.525
- Who?
- Catherine.

34:28.150 --> 34:31.237
It's good to know
all those late nights and meaningless sex

34:31.237 --> 34:33.156
haven't dulled your senses.

34:34.574 --> 34:37.286
Go see if Standish is stuck
under her duvet.

34:38.411 --> 34:39.413
Is that her key?

34:39.413 --> 34:41.873
Of course it's her fucking key.
Why would he give us a random key?

34:41.873 --> 34:42.958
She's sharp, that one.

34:42.958 --> 34:45.878
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No, thanks. I don't need babysitting.

34:46.378 --> 34:48.005
Didn't mean that like that either.

34:48.839 --> 34:51.049
Wait. What do you think has happened
to Catherine?

34:51.049 --> 34:55.512
Maybe she fell off the wagon
or ran away to start a donkey sanctuary.

34:55.512 --> 34:57.264
All I know is she's not here.

34:59.224 --> 35:01.518
Well, last night...

35:04.730 --> 35:05.898
What?

35:05.898 --> 35:08.775
No, it's probably nothing.
Maybe she's just late.

35:09.276 --> 35:10.444
She's never late.

35:10.944 --> 35:12.946
And if she was, she'd ring.

35:12.946 --> 35:14.948
But she can't, 'cause her mobile is off.

35:16.200 --> 35:20.996
Okay. Well, then her battery ran out
or she, you know, got stuck on the Tube.

35:22.497 --> 35:24.124
No, she doesn't get the Tube.

35:25.125 --> 35:26.877
And her phone doesn't run out.

35:27.544 --> 35:29.796
And you're only making
these dumb suggestions

35:29.796 --> 35:32.841
because you don't want to admit
that you might've fucked up.

35:32.841 --> 35:34.801
So why don't you just tell me
what happened,

35:34.801 --> 35:37.471
and I'll decide how much I hurt you?

35:39.681 --> 35:41.767
Last night,
I said goodbye to her on the street.

35:42.684 --> 35:45.354
And then this guy bumped into me,
heading in her direction.

35:46.104 --> 35:47.189
Age and description.

35:47.189 --> 35:51.693
Late 30s, Black, athletic. I really didn't
get that good a look at the guy.

35:51.693 --> 35:53.737
He probably wasn't even following her.

35:54.947 --> 35:59.493
But you didn't think of hanging around
to find out?

36:00.202 --> 36:02.579
I guess I was thinking,
why would anyone be following her?

36:14.675 --> 36:15.759
Ho.

36:17.010 --> 36:18.345
Ho!

36:19.680 --> 36:22.224
Check the hospital.
See if Standish has been admitted.

36:22.224 --> 36:23.725
- What?
- You heard me.

36:23.725 --> 36:25.978
- What do you want me to do?
- Quit.

36:25.978 --> 36:27.312
No, seriously.

36:27.312 --> 36:30.274
No, seriously, I want you to quit.
You're shit at this.

36:30.274 --> 36:32.901
But failing that, get these files sorted.

36:32.901 --> 36:35.654
This place is a fucking mess.

36:47.165 --> 36:49.376
Catherine's not here. She is not at work.

36:49.376 --> 36:51.795
She'll either show up or she won't.
There's nothing much we can do.

36:51.795 --> 36:53.213
Well, she might be here.

36:53.213 --> 36:54.840
She might've died in her sleep.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.842
She could be slipping away as we speak.

36:56.842 --> 37:00.012
She could've drowned in the bath,
choked on a grape.

37:02.681 --> 37:05.350
Or her neighbor is a murderer,
putting her through a meat grinder.

37:06.518 --> 37:09.229
I think you've got more in common with Ho
than you realize.

37:13.358 --> 37:15.777
Fuck's sake. There's a second lock.

37:15.777 --> 37:18.405
'Course there's a second lock.
She probably got it fitted

37:18.405 --> 37:20.866
when she realized Lamb knew
where she hid her spare.

37:21.783 --> 37:22.784
Right. That's that then.

37:23.619 --> 37:25.454
We'll have to come back
with a warrant and a locksmith,

37:25.454 --> 37:28.207
not that we'll find anything
in there anyways.

37:30.042 --> 37:31.335
What the--

37:32.252 --> 37:35.422
She didn't pick up yesterday's post.
Don't think she came home.

37:35.422 --> 37:37.925
- You just broke in.
- Lamb will be cool with it.

37:37.925 --> 37:41.011
Yeah. Well, I'm not.
Could be arrested for this. Geez.

37:41.011 --> 37:42.679
No, we can't. We're MI5.

37:43.472 --> 37:45.474
This is exactly how I imagined her flat.

37:46.350 --> 37:48.685
Yeah? How do you imagine Ho's?

37:49.186 --> 37:53.524
Human skulls, stolen underwear,
pictures of Louisa with her eyes cut out.

37:58.070 --> 38:00.405
The dress she had on yesterday
hasn't been put for washing,

38:00.405 --> 38:02.074
but the one from the day before has.

38:02.908 --> 38:04.117
Better call Lamb.

38:06.620 --> 38:08.705
So you don't know
if he's a regular or not?

38:09.957 --> 38:11.208
I don't know him.

38:12.125 --> 38:14.878
But you're sure you saw them
heading to the cafÃ© together?

38:27.599 --> 38:30.269
Heya. Can I get a black Americano, please?
To go.

38:30.811 --> 38:33.105
- Sure. That's 3.50.
- How much?

38:33.772 --> 38:35.190
It'll be at the end of the counter.

38:35.983 --> 38:39.444
Did the coffee beans fly in first class?
Absolute thieves.

38:44.992 --> 38:47.452
- Where are your loos?
- Through the door out back.

40:10.744 --> 40:11.745
Chair.

40:18.418 --> 40:22.005
Let's get this over with. Eyes front.

40:23.215 --> 40:24.299
Let's make this quick.

40:26.760 --> 40:27.761
Sit still.

40:29.304 --> 40:31.181
Up. Up!

40:48.532 --> 40:53.996
Yesterday when I was waiting,
do you remember the other patients?

40:54.496 --> 40:57.875
I'm not allowed to talk
about the other patients. Confidentiality.

40:58.584 --> 41:01.336
The guy was sitting in the corner,
filling in a form.

41:01.336 --> 41:02.796
But I'm guessing he didn't hand it in.

41:02.796 --> 41:05.340
And if he didn't hand it in,
then he's not a patient.

41:05.340 --> 41:07.634
I can speak slower if you like.

41:08.802 --> 41:12.347
All I want to know is, did he leave
when I went in with Dr. Daley?

41:14.641 --> 41:16.685
It was around then.

41:26.486 --> 41:29.281
- Yep?
- I think she's been abducted.

41:29.281 --> 41:33.368
Yeah. They had people watching me
in case she pulled the alarm cord.

41:34.077 --> 41:35.120
Why were they watching you?

41:36.330 --> 41:38.457
Because I'm really fucking good.

41:38.457 --> 41:42.961
The caretaker at AA said she headed
to a cafÃ© with a man after the meeting.

41:42.961 --> 41:44.546
<i>But I reckon something
must have spooked her</i>

41:44.546 --> 41:47.007
'cause I found her hairpin
in the road behind.

41:47.007 --> 41:48.675
You get a description of him?

41:48.675 --> 41:50.135
<i>Black, 30s, fit.</i>

41:50.135 --> 41:52.763
Yeah, it sounds
like the guy Cartwright saw

41:52.763 --> 41:55.641
tailing her from Slough House. CCTV?

41:55.641 --> 41:57.935
Cable's cut in the alley behind the cafÃ©.

41:57.935 --> 42:00.521
They must have driven her out that way
to snatch her in a vehicle.

42:00.521 --> 42:02.773
All right. Well, check her route again.

42:02.773 --> 42:05.567
I would be amazed
if you hadn't missed something.

42:07.402 --> 42:08.987
Why would anyone want to take Catherine?

42:10.697 --> 42:12.324
Maybe they got a death wish.

42:25.462 --> 42:26.839
Catherine's messaged.

42:27.923 --> 42:29.007
What did she say?

42:29.007 --> 42:30.092
Thank God.

42:33.554 --> 42:34.555
Shit.

42:39.852 --> 42:42.271
- Catherine?
- Tell anyone, she dies.

42:42.896 --> 42:46.483
<i>Barbican Bridge. One minute, or she dies.</i>
