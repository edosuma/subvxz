03:40.728 --> 03:44.231
Good morning, your Highness.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.943
Good morning, your Highness.

03:48.152 --> 03:51.447
Good morning, your Highness.

03:51.655 --> 03:57.870
- Happy birthday, your Highness.
- Yes, it is my birthday.

04:36.784 --> 04:39.203
Oha, it is my 21st birthday.

04:39.411 --> 04:43.916
Do you think, just once,
I might use the bathroom by myself?

04:44.124 --> 04:47.962
Most amusing, sir.
Wipers!

05:06.605 --> 05:09.316
The royal penis is clean,
your Highness.

06:05.372 --> 06:09.543
His Highness
must be very excited today.

06:09.752 --> 06:13.547
Today is your 21st birthday.
It means you meet your wife-to-be.

06:13.756 --> 06:17.009
How can a man get excited
about a woman he's never seen?

07:00.469 --> 07:03.347
He certainly is quiet this morning.

07:03.555 --> 07:06.267
He looks sad.

07:08.227 --> 07:14.525
- Is something troubling you, my son?
- No, Father.

07:15.943 --> 07:22.283
I'm more than the exalted ruler
of this land and master of all I survey.

07:22.491 --> 07:25.369
I'm also a concerned dad.

07:26.412 --> 07:31.875
Well, Father... Just a moment.

07:32.084 --> 07:36.130
- What is he doing?
- It looks as if he's coming here.

07:37.423 --> 07:39.883
Wait right there, Akeem.

07:40.092 --> 07:41.885
Rose bearers!

07:49.310 --> 07:52.187
Akeem. Come sit.

08:04.658 --> 08:08.412
Now, my son...
Have you grown a moustache?

08:08.621 --> 08:11.498
Jaffe, it has been a year.

08:12.833 --> 08:17.671
- So, what is it, my son?
- First of all, things like this.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.883
- Like what?
- The rose petals.

08:21.091 --> 08:25.804
You're the son of a king, why shouldn'
you walk on the petals of roses?

08:26.013 --> 08:29.433
But if there were no rose petals,
I would still be the son of a king.

08:29.642 --> 08:32.852
Then it is settled. From this day forth,

08:33.062 --> 08:38.817
anyone who throws roses
at my son's feet will answer to me.

08:39.025 --> 08:41.528
It is not just that, it is everything.

08:41.736 --> 08:46.241
The cooking, the pampering,
the dressing, the bathing...

08:46.450 --> 08:49.119
Actually, I rather enjoy the bathing,

08:49.328 --> 08:54.124
but I'd like to cook for myself,
dress myself, wipe my own backside.

08:54.333 --> 09:00.005
- And why can't I find my own wife?
- Aha! So that's it?

09:00.214 --> 09:05.052
We've gone through a lot of trouble
to select for you a very fine wife.

09:05.261 --> 09:10.432
Since she was born, she was taught
to walk, speak and think as a queen.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.603
But what if I don't love her?

09:14.812 --> 09:17.982
It's normal to feel anxiety
about meeting your queen.

09:18.190 --> 09:20.818
When I met your father, I was terrified.

09:21.026 --> 09:23.988
I must admit, I was frightened, too.

09:24.196 --> 09:27.616
I was so nervous, I became nauseous.

09:27.825 --> 09:31.870
But over the years, I have grown
to love your father very much.

09:32.079 --> 09:36.542
You see, my son, there's a fine line
between love and nausea.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.878
I understand, but when I marry,

09:40.087 --> 09:44.258
I want the woman to love me
for who I am, not because of what I am.

09:44.466 --> 09:48.721
- And who are you?
- A man who's never tied his shoes.

09:48.929 --> 09:53.517
Wrong! You're a prince
who's never tied his shoes.

09:53.726 --> 09:59.273
I tied my own shoes once.
It is an overrated experience.

10:01.567 --> 10:04.987
Good morning, your Majesty.
It's another beautiful day in Zamunda.

10:05.195 --> 10:07.740
And, Semmi, what is it now?

10:10.451 --> 10:14.330
You look especially radiant today,
your Grace.

10:14.538 --> 10:20.586
I was remarking to my mother the other
day what lovely skin the Queen has.

10:20.794 --> 10:23.881
Semmi, don't you have somewhere
you should go?

10:25.507 --> 10:29.053
Yes, I was about to take the birthday
boy for his daily workout.

10:29.261 --> 10:32.181
Excuse me, Father. And Mother.

10:35.434 --> 10:38.270
Have a good day, my son.

10:40.648 --> 10:43.484
Akeem, what happened
to the rose bearers?

10:46.695 --> 10:51.909
Let's see if you can defend yourself,
you sweat from a baboon's balls.

11:12.388 --> 11:15.516
So you can have a woman
who will obey your every command,

11:15.724 --> 11:19.186
but you'd rather have a woman
who has an opinion?

11:19.395 --> 11:23.857
Only dogs are to obey. If you love
your wife, you'll value her opinion.

11:30.948 --> 11:34.743
Hippopotamus shit! You're the heir
to the throne of Zamunda.

11:34.952 --> 11:40.791
Your wife need only have a pretty face,
firm backside and big breasts.

11:55.055 --> 11:58.892
So you would share your bed,
and your fortune, with a beautiful fool

11:59.101 --> 12:03.355
That's the way it's always been
with men of power. It's tradition.

12:07.192 --> 12:10.529
It's also tradition
that times must change.

12:29.298 --> 12:34.887
Get your Royal Engagement T-shirt!
Step up and get your Royal T-shirt!

13:16.637 --> 13:21.016
- These really are delicious.
- Yes, thank you.

13:28.691 --> 13:31.402
Your Majesty.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.613
I am Colonel Issy.

13:34.822 --> 13:41.078
And today, with your blessing,
I offer my daughter to your son.

13:43.914 --> 13:48.419
My blessing is granted.
Let the courtship commence.

13:48.627 --> 13:55.259
Pardon me. Step aside, please. Coming
through. Excuse me. Out of the way!

13:58.554 --> 14:04.101
Greetings, great Prince.
Presenting Miss Imani Issi.

16:12.187 --> 16:18.611
She's your Queen-to-be

16:18.819 --> 16:23.240
A Queen-to-be forever

16:23.449 --> 16:26.994
A Queen who'll do whatever

16:27.202 --> 16:31.915
His Highness desires

16:32.124 --> 16:38.297
She's your Queen-to-be

16:38.505 --> 16:42.885
A vision of perfection

16:43.093 --> 16:46.305
Ah object of affection

16:46.513 --> 16:51.143
To quench your royal fire

16:51.352 --> 16:57.483
Completely free from infection

16:57.691 --> 17:01.028
To be used at your discretion

17:01.236 --> 17:07.785
Waiting only for your direction

17:09.036 --> 17:17.336
Your Queen-to-be

17:34.311 --> 17:38.315
May I talk to you alone
for a moment, please?

17:41.360 --> 17:45.406
Excuse us for a moment.

18:15.811 --> 18:20.274
- So...
- Am I not all you dreamed I would be?

18:20.482 --> 18:22.192
You're fine. Beautiful

18:22.401 --> 18:27.072
But if we're going to be married, we
should talk and get to know each other.

18:27.281 --> 18:31.744
Ever since I was born,
I have been trained to serve you.

18:31.952 --> 18:36.582
I know, but I'd like to know about you.
What do you like to do?

18:36.790 --> 18:39.752
Whatever you like.

18:39.960 --> 18:44.673
- What kind of music do you like?
- Whatever kind of music you like.

18:45.925 --> 18:50.095
I know what I like, and you know what
I like, 'cause you were trained to know,

18:50.304 --> 18:54.224
but I would like to know what you like.
Do you have a favourite food?

18:54.433 --> 18:56.894
Good! What is your favourite food?

18:57.102 --> 18:59.980
Whatever food you like.

19:01.315 --> 19:05.486
This is impossible.
I command you not to obey me.

19:05.694 --> 19:07.821
No.

19:09.281 --> 19:13.118
Are you saying that no matter
what I tell you to do, you will do?

19:13.327 --> 19:15.204
Yes, your Highness.

19:15.412 --> 19:19.458
- Ahything I say, you'll do?
- Yes, your Highness.

19:19.667 --> 19:22.127
Bark like a dog.

19:25.089 --> 19:27.258
A big dog.

19:30.177 --> 19:32.846
Hop on one leg.

19:34.515 --> 19:38.102
Make a noise like an orang-utan.

19:41.188 --> 19:44.692
I see the two of you are getting along.

19:47.528 --> 19:50.698
Excuse me, Imani, for a moment.

20:00.916 --> 20:04.545
Fine girl, isn't she?
I told you not to worry.

20:05.588 --> 20:07.548
Father...

20:11.218 --> 20:13.971
About this wedding...

20:14.179 --> 20:16.432
The guests are waiting, your Majesty.

20:16.640 --> 20:21.395
Let them wait! I'm talking to my son.

20:23.063 --> 20:25.399
Come. Let's go for a stroll.

20:38.495 --> 20:41.165
Hello, Babar.

20:46.420 --> 20:52.051
Time flies. It seems only yesterday
I ordered your first diaper changed,

20:52.259 --> 20:56.388
and now you're a man
who's about to be married.

20:56.597 --> 21:00.309
She will give you much pleasure,
don't you think?

21:01.310 --> 21:03.687
I'm not sure if I'm ready.

21:04.647 --> 21:07.524
I know we never had a talk about this,

21:07.733 --> 21:12.947
but I always assumed you had sex
with your bathers. I know I do.

21:13.155 --> 21:19.078
It's not that. I'm 21 years old,
and I have never left Zamunda.

21:19.286 --> 21:23.332
I have yet to experience
what the outside world has to offer.

21:23.540 --> 21:27.419
- So you want to sow your royal oats?
- No, it's not that...

21:27.628 --> 21:31.382
You're right! Get out, see the world.
Enjoy yourself.

21:31.590 --> 21:36.929
Fulfil every erotic desire,
and in 40 days, you will marry Imani.

21:37.137 --> 21:40.057
- But, Father...
- it is settled.

21:55.239 --> 21:58.117
May I have your attention, please?

21:59.618 --> 22:03.747
The wedding will proceed in 40 days.
You may go home now. Good night.

22:03.956 --> 22:07.960
Oha. Prepare the royal baggage.
My son is going on a trip.

22:11.255 --> 22:14.133
Prepare the royal baggage!

22:17.219 --> 22:20.806
This trip is an excellent idea.
40 days of fornication.

22:21.015 --> 22:27.021
Semmi. I have something else in mind.
I intend to find my bride.

22:28.022 --> 22:33.110
What is wrong with the one you have?
Didn't you want to rip her clothes off?

22:33.319 --> 22:36.780
I want a woman who will arouse
my intellect as well as my loins.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.950
- Where would you find such a woman?
- In America.

22:43.579 --> 22:46.415
The land is so big,
the choices so infinite.

22:46.624 --> 22:50.961
Where shall we go?
Los Ahgeles or New York?

22:51.170 --> 22:53.881
We'll let fate decide.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.928
Heads, New York. Tails, Los Ahgeles.

23:01.972 --> 23:04.808
We go to New York.

23:05.017 --> 23:09.396
But where in New York can one find
a woman with grace and elegance?

23:09.605 --> 23:12.232
A woman suitable for a king.

23:15.903 --> 23:17.446
Queens!

23:33.629 --> 23:38.634
Mr Frank Oznowitz. Please p¡ck up
a white courtesy telephone.

23:43.639 --> 23:48.143
No one here can know I am royalty.
I must appear as an average man.

23:48.352 --> 23:51.063
I will not say a word.

24:04.952 --> 24:07.037
Halt!

24:07.788 --> 24:10.541
You dumb fuck!

24:15.045 --> 24:17.673
Take us to Queens at once.

24:21.302 --> 24:26.515
Do you want to go to Queens?
Rich fellows should be in Manhattan.

24:26.724 --> 24:28.767
Stay at the Waldorf or the Palace.

24:28.976 --> 24:32.855
- Take us to the Palace.
- No, I want Queens.

24:33.063 --> 24:37.109
And we're not rich.
We're ordinary African students.

24:37.318 --> 24:40.195
Whatever you say, pal

24:40.404 --> 24:45.784
- What part of Queens do you want?
- Take us to the most common part.

24:46.535 --> 24:51.832
That's easy. If there's one thing
Queens got a lot of, it's common parts.

24:54.251 --> 24:56.378
What does "dumb fuck" mean?

25:26.951 --> 25:30.496
- Is this shitty enough for you?
- Yes, this is perfect.

26:07.116 --> 26:11.578
Fascinating! Semmi, look at this.

26:14.206 --> 26:19.837
America is great indeed. A country so
free, one can throw glass on the street.

26:20.045 --> 26:23.549
You must be
out of your goddamn m¡nd!

26:25.593 --> 26:27.219
Listen. Real Americans.

26:28.971 --> 26:31.599
Sugar Ray Robinson's
the greatest fighter that ever lived.

26:31.807 --> 26:35.185
- What about Joe Louis?
- "The Brown Bomber".

26:35.394 --> 26:38.689
- That was a great boxer.
- You're damn right.

26:38.897 --> 26:41.775
I suppose nobody in here
ever heard of Cassius Clay.

26:41.984 --> 26:44.695
He's got a point. Cassius Clay
was a bad motherfucker.

26:44.903 --> 26:46.280
I ain't saying Clay ain't bad.

26:46.488 --> 26:51.285
I stopped liking him when he changed
his name to Muhammad Ali.

26:51.493 --> 26:53.579
Wait a second. Wait a second.

26:53.787 --> 26:59.043
A man has the right to change his name
to whatever he wants to change it to.

26:59.251 --> 27:02.504
And if a man wants to be called
Muhammad Ali,

27:02.713 --> 27:08.594
you should respect his wishes
and call the man Muhammad Ali.

27:08.802 --> 27:12.473
His momma named him Clay.
I'm going to call him Clay.

27:12.681 --> 27:16.018
- I say Clay.
- Get out of here.

27:16.226 --> 27:21.565
He'll always be Clay to me. I don'
care what he change his name to.

27:21.774 --> 27:25.027
Well, then you're a putz.
The three of you. Three putzes.

27:25.235 --> 27:29.949
You should change the name from
"My-T-Sharp" to "The Three Putzes".

27:41.835 --> 27:46.048
- What the fuck do you want?
- We desire a room.

27:46.257 --> 27:49.885
You'd better not be wasting my time.
You got money?

27:51.971 --> 27:54.056
Come on in, gentlemen.

27:56.809 --> 27:59.603
Yo, man! Get the big bag.

28:03.732 --> 28:09.321
Excuse me if I was brusque, but we
get boo-boos in here without a dollar.

28:09.530 --> 28:13.659
Obviously, you gentlemen
came in on another boat.

28:13.867 --> 28:17.371
- We seek meagre accommodations.
- Excuse me?

28:17.579 --> 28:20.124
We require a room that is very poor.

28:25.254 --> 28:27.923
Hey, Stu.
Your rent's due, motherfucker.

28:28.132 --> 28:33.512
And don't pull that falling down the stairs
shit on me. You're conscious.

28:33.721 --> 28:36.974
Every month, the same damn thing...

28:54.241 --> 28:56.702
Here we are.

28:57.620 --> 29:02.541
There's only one bathroom on this floor,
so you have to share it.

29:05.169 --> 29:10.507
Got a bit of an insect problem, but
you boys from Africa are used to that.

29:11.759 --> 29:15.846
And don't use the elevator.
It's a death trap.

29:16.055 --> 29:20.684
This is the place that I was
telling you about. It's real fucked up.

29:20.893 --> 29:25.940
The window faces a brick wall.
I used to rent it to a blind man.

29:34.615 --> 29:38.535
It's a damn shame
what they did to that dog.

29:44.041 --> 29:46.210
We will take the room.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.796
Yes.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.939
Behold, Semmi! Life. Real life.

30:07.147 --> 30:10.693
A thing that we have been denied
for far too long.

30:12.903 --> 30:16.240
- Good morn¡ng, my ne¡ghbours!
- Fuck you!

30:16.448 --> 30:21.578
Yes! Yes! Fuck you, too!

30:40.556 --> 30:44.852
I suspect that these are the people
that have stolen our luggage.

30:50.274 --> 30:52.109
Do you want to buy
some toothbrushes?

30:52.318 --> 30:57.531
I've got some real fly personal
hygiene products, and a hair-dryer.

30:57.740 --> 31:01.243
Thief! Stop thief! Come back, thief!

31:01.452 --> 31:04.496
- Semmi, let him go.
- Those things belong to us.

31:04.705 --> 31:08.918
It's good we're rid of those things.
Let them wear our princely robes.

31:09.126 --> 31:13.255
We're in New York now.
Let us dress as New Yorkers.

31:19.219 --> 31:24.141
- I feel like a complete idiot.
- Don't be ridiculous.

31:24.350 --> 31:30.773
You know, you can be all the th¡ngs
you've always wanted to be.

31:30.981 --> 31:33.943
Beautiful, sexy...

31:34.568 --> 31:37.488
One, two, three...

31:58.425 --> 31:59.969
Soul Glo.

32:02.346 --> 32:04.974
Perhaps I should cut off
my prince's lock.

32:06.725 --> 32:10.062
You're out of your mind! Joe Louis
is the greatest boxer that ever lived.

32:10.271 --> 32:11.689
I'll be with you in a minute.

32:11.897 --> 32:17.486
He was better than Clay, Sugar Ray
and that new boy - Mike Tyson.

32:17.695 --> 32:20.906
He was better than him, too.
He'd whip all their asses!

32:21.782 --> 32:25.953
- What about Rocky Marciano?
- There they go. There they go.

32:26.161 --> 32:31.083
Every time I talk about boxing, a white
man pulls Rocky Marciano out his ass.

32:31.292 --> 32:34.587
That's their one, that's their one.
"Rocky Marciano, Rocky Marciano!"

32:34.795 --> 32:37.756
Let me tell you something.
Rocky Marciano was good,

32:37.965 --> 32:41.468
but compared to Joe Louis,
Rocky Marciano ain't shit!

32:41.677 --> 32:43.971
He beat Joe Louis' ass.

32:44.179 --> 32:48.934
- He did whop Joe Louis' ass.
- Joe Louis was 75 years old!

32:49.143 --> 32:51.103
I don't know how old he was,
but he got his ass whooped.

32:51.312 --> 32:55.482
Joe Louis came out of retirement
to fight Marciano. He was 76 years old.

32:55.691 --> 32:58.402
Joe Louis always lied about his age.

32:58.611 --> 33:00.779
Once, Frank Sinatra sat in this chair.

33:00.988 --> 33:04.241
I said, "Y ou hang out with Joe Louis.
How old is he?"

33:04.450 --> 33:09.204
Frank said,
"Joe Louis is 137 years old".

33:09.413 --> 33:12.791
Oh, man.
You ain't never met no Frank Sinatra.

33:14.627 --> 33:18.005
Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you!
Who's next?

33:26.847 --> 33:29.183
What's that? Some kind
of weave or something?

33:29.391 --> 33:32.353
It's my natural hair.
I've been growing it since birth.

33:33.520 --> 33:35.981
What kind of chemicals
you got in there?

33:36.190 --> 33:39.276
None, only juices and berries.

33:39.485 --> 33:43.530
That ain't nothing but Ultra-Perm.
How do you want it cut?

33:45.658 --> 33:48.410
Just make it nice and neat.

33:57.044 --> 33:59.922
That'll be 8 dollars.

34:07.846 --> 34:11.850
Tell me, Semmi. Honestly...
How do I look?

34:15.353 --> 34:17.022
It is time to find your queen.

34:48.721 --> 34:51.556
I've got a secret.

34:51.764 --> 34:54.476
I worship the devil

34:58.981 --> 35:04.236
See, that's the problem.
I can't find a man that can satisfy me.

35:04.445 --> 35:07.865
Some guys go an hour,
hour and a half. That's it.

35:08.073 --> 35:12.870
A man's got to put in overtime
for me to get off.

35:13.078 --> 35:16.749
I'm not interested in a man
unless he drives a B.M.W.

35:16.957 --> 35:21.420
Well, you know, baby, I'm almost single.
My husband's on Death Row.

35:21.629 --> 35:27.801
This is the first date Teresa and I have
been on since the doctor separated us.

35:29.053 --> 35:32.514
I'm into the group thing.

35:34.308 --> 35:37.686
I was Joan of Arc in my former life.

35:41.774 --> 35:44.068
My name is Peaches
And I'm the best

35:44.276 --> 35:47.154
All the D.J. S want
to feel my breasts

35:52.242 --> 35:55.829
I want to work in videos, but I want to be
my own star in the video,

35:56.038 --> 36:01.335
because I want to be a pop singer,
a rock singer, and write my own songs.

36:01.543 --> 36:06.215
And then I'm going to try an actress,
'cause people tell me I'm a natural

36:06.423 --> 36:11.637
Then I'm going to write and direct
my own stories, produce the movies...

36:25.276 --> 36:27.861
I hope you don't mind me coming over
and sitting down.

36:28.070 --> 36:33.450
But I've been watching you all evening,
and I want to tear you apart.

36:35.369 --> 36:37.997
And your friend, too.

36:41.584 --> 36:47.131
Does every woman in New York
have a severe emotional problem?

36:47.339 --> 36:50.301
I doubt we will ever find your queen.

36:51.969 --> 36:57.182
- Mr Clarence.
- The boys from Africa! How are you?

36:57.808 --> 37:03.022
- Where can one find nice women here?
- You've got to get out and look.

37:03.230 --> 37:05.232
We've been to every bar in Queens.

37:05.441 --> 37:08.068
You can't go to no bar
to find a nice woman.

37:08.277 --> 37:13.824
You've got to go to nice places,
like the library and church.

37:14.033 --> 37:17.244
Or this place, where I'm going tonight.
The Black Awareness Rally.

37:17.453 --> 37:20.789
There's going to be
some fine women there. Clean girls.

37:28.213 --> 37:31.383
I didn't come here
to preach to you today.

37:36.305 --> 37:42.394
But when I look at these contestants
for The Miss Black Awareness pageant,

37:42.603 --> 37:48.317
I feel good, 'cause I know
there's a God somewhere.

37:48.525 --> 37:50.611
There's a God somewhere.

37:50.819 --> 37:53.030
Turn around, ladies.

37:53.238 --> 37:57.660
You know there's a God
who sits up high, and looks down low.

37:57.868 --> 38:00.537
Man cannot make it like this.

38:00.746 --> 38:04.124
Larry Flint, Hugh Hefner...
They can take the picture,

38:04.333 --> 38:09.838
but they can't make it.
Only God above can make it for ya.

38:10.047 --> 38:15.135
These are the best women Queens has
to offer. Pick one, and let's go home.

38:15.344 --> 38:17.137
Be patient, my friend.

38:17.346 --> 38:21.267
Do you love him? Do you feel joy?
Say "joy"!

38:21.475 --> 38:24.103
- Joy!
- Joy.

38:24.311 --> 38:25.980
- Joy!
- Joy!

38:26.188 --> 38:31.318
- Can I get a "Amen"?
- Amen, brother!

38:31.527 --> 38:34.363
Don't be ashamed to call his name.

38:34.571 --> 38:35.906
Yes, Lord!

38:36.115 --> 38:40.077
Only God can give that woman
that kind of joy.

38:41.579 --> 38:45.583
- Make a joyful noise unto the Lord.
- Joy!

38:45.791 --> 38:48.627
- I am very happy to be here.
- Amen!

38:51.630 --> 38:54.174
Can I get a "Amen"?

38:55.551 --> 39:01.307
I don't know what you've come to do,
but I've come to praise His name.

39:02.766 --> 39:04.810
Lord, Lord...

39:07.062 --> 39:10.858
Girls, you can leave now.
Thank you very much.

39:11.066 --> 39:13.944
There's a God somewhere.

39:15.112 --> 39:17.990
I've got a special treat for you
this evening.

39:18.198 --> 39:22.202
A young man, that you all know
as Joe the policeman

39:22.411 --> 39:26.248
from the "What's Going Down"
episode of "That's My Momma".

39:26.457 --> 39:30.294
I want you to put your hands together
and welcome him to the stage.

39:30.502 --> 39:34.506
A big round of applause
for Jackson Height's own

39:34.715 --> 39:39.720
Mr Randy Watson! Randy Watson.

39:39.929 --> 39:43.599
- That boy's good.
- Good and terrible.

39:45.267 --> 39:47.061
And Reverend Brown.

39:47.269 --> 39:51.440
He's been my reverend since
I was a little boy, and I love him dearly.

39:51.649 --> 39:57.237
You're a very special man.
Reverend Brown! Reverend Brown.

39:58.572 --> 40:04.578
It feels so lovely to be here tonight.
Give yourselves a round of applause.

40:04.787 --> 40:09.708
Give a big round of applause
to my band, Sexual Chocolate.

40:13.671 --> 40:18.259
Sexual Chocolate.
They play so fine, don't you agree?

40:38.362 --> 40:42.491
- Some of the good stuff? Coming up.
- Do you want a Coke?

40:43.742 --> 40:47.871
- Enjoying the show?
- Enjoy, young man.

41:15.357 --> 41:18.152
Sexy Chocolate!

41:19.528 --> 41:20.863
Sexy Chocolate!

41:26.285 --> 41:30.581
- Goddamn, that boy can sing.
- You must be crazy.

41:39.798 --> 41:43.052
Put your hands together
for Mr Randy Watson.

41:43.260 --> 41:47.222
Yeah, one more time!
Randy Watson, how about it!

41:47.431 --> 41:52.102
Before we go any further,
I'd like to thank Mr Cleo McDowell,

41:52.311 --> 41:56.857
who's responsible for the fine food
and beverage here tonight.

41:57.066 --> 42:00.736
Cleo, I know you're proud
of your daughters. We are, too.

42:00.945 --> 42:04.281
Please welcome one of the organisers
of tonight's festivities.

42:04.490 --> 42:07.743
Miss Lisa McDowell.
Lisa, come up here, baby girl

42:08.410 --> 42:12.581
- Work in a plug for the new salad bar.
- I'm not mentioning the restaurant.

42:12.790 --> 42:15.793
At least give them the address.

42:19.463 --> 42:24.510
Someone ought to put you on a plate
and suck you up with a biscuit.

42:28.347 --> 42:34.144
Black Awareness Week is
an opportunity for self -expression.

42:34.353 --> 42:37.189
- May we leave now?
- No, wait.

42:37.398 --> 42:43.362
...express himself through song.
In his own unique way, but...

42:43.570 --> 42:46.323
The song makes a good point.

42:46.532 --> 42:49.034
The ch¡ldren are our future,

42:49.243 --> 42:54.248
and it's up to all of us to provide a place
where children can express themselves.

42:55.207 --> 42:58.627
We need to rebuild Lincoln Park.

42:59.503 --> 43:05.593
Ushers are passing with donation
baskets, so please - give all you can.

43:07.011 --> 43:10.472
We're happy to get
the kind of money that jingles,

43:10.681 --> 43:13.350
but we'd rather get the kind that folds.

43:22.526 --> 43:25.904
- Donations. Donations!
- I thought it was the trash.

43:26.113 --> 43:28.449
- Stupid ass.
- I'll whip your ass.

43:28.657 --> 43:34.079
- You tar-black motherfucker.
- There's women here. Calm down.

43:46.383 --> 43:48.552
Thank you.

43:52.431 --> 43:56.018
- She is wonderful
- Akeem...

43:56.727 --> 44:01.440
You can see Lisa, and Mr McDowell,
at McDowell's Restaurant,

44:01.649 --> 44:05.861
8507, Queens Boulevard.

44:06.070 --> 44:08.697
8507, Queens Boulevard.

44:20.918 --> 44:24.463
Your first job every morning
will be to sweep this walkway.

44:24.672 --> 44:28.634
Then I want you to wash
all the windows. Real good, too.

44:28.842 --> 44:31.929
And don't leave no streaks.

44:35.015 --> 44:38.310
What are you doing?

44:39.853 --> 44:43.482
Get the hell out of here
before I bust that camera!

44:47.194 --> 44:52.449
Me and the McDonald's people,
we've got this little misunderstanding.

44:55.160 --> 44:59.873
See, they're "McDonald's".
I'm "McDowell's".

45:02.167 --> 45:06.922
They've got the golden arches.
Mine are the golden arcs.

45:09.883 --> 45:12.803
They've got the Big Mac.
I've got the Big Mick.

45:13.012 --> 45:17.516
We both got two all -beef patties, sauce,
lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions.

45:17.725 --> 45:23.564
But they use a sesame seed bun.
My buns have no seeds.

45:25.649 --> 45:28.319
I've got it.

45:31.196 --> 45:35.534
You've got to mop the food-prep area
twice a day.

45:35.743 --> 45:39.288
- Do you know how to mop?
- Yes, of course.

45:40.164 --> 45:42.458
There you go.

45:56.138 --> 46:00.309
Don't use the bucket.
It'll just confuse you.

46:00.517 --> 46:04.772
When you get through here,
you take out the trash.

46:04.980 --> 46:08.817
Come with me,
I've got an easy job for you.

46:39.473 --> 46:43.352
- Hi!
- Hello.

46:45.688 --> 46:47.940
Hello.

46:48.899 --> 46:51.360
Hi...

46:52.486 --> 46:54.947
I am Akeem.

46:56.574 --> 46:59.702
It's nice to meet you, Akeem.

46:59.910 --> 47:05.374
I've been placed in charge of garbage.
Do you have any that needs disposal

47:05.583 --> 47:08.836
No, it's totally empty.

47:09.962 --> 47:14.550
When it fills up, don't be afraid
to call me. I'll take it out urgently.

47:16.510 --> 47:18.387
That's good to know.

47:18.596 --> 47:22.558
When you think of garbage,
think of Akeem.

47:24.685 --> 47:28.355
Well, I have to get back
to my sanitation duties.

47:28.564 --> 47:33.652
Maybe we will have a chance
to talk again on a professional level

47:35.237 --> 47:37.531
Goodbye, Akeem.

48:35.589 --> 48:39.969
Darryl You're looking sharp.

48:40.177 --> 48:44.390
How about a Mick-Shake?
I believe strawberry is your favourite.

48:44.598 --> 48:46.267
Straw.

48:46.475 --> 48:51.146
Lisa's in the back.
She's waiting for you. Come on.

48:53.148 --> 48:56.527
- How's everything at Soul Glo?
- Fine.

48:56.735 --> 48:59.947
Our home weave products
are really taking off.

49:00.155 --> 49:05.452
Dad isn't using the tickets for the Jets
game. I thought you might enjoy them.

49:05.661 --> 49:09.039
That's very considerate of you.
Thank you!

49:11.542 --> 49:15.212
- Lisa! Look who's here, honey.
- Hi!

49:15.421 --> 49:18.882
You two kids have a good time,
you hear?

49:23.596 --> 49:25.389
- Ready?
- Sure.

49:26.473 --> 49:28.892
I want to ask you something.

49:29.101 --> 49:34.732
At the rally, someone stuck a large
amount of cash in one of the boxes.

49:34.940 --> 49:38.319
You wouldn't happen to know
who that was, would you?

49:40.404 --> 49:43.866
- Well, I...
- I thought it was you!

49:44.909 --> 49:48.162
You know me. Ahything for the kids.

49:54.668 --> 49:57.296
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

50:00.591 --> 50:05.554
I got four tickets to the St. John's game.
Maybe your sister can bring someone.

50:05.763 --> 50:09.141
Take care of this, will you?

50:21.362 --> 50:24.573
- Excuse me.
- Hey, it's Kunta Kinte.

50:29.203 --> 50:31.664
What can I do you for?

50:34.708 --> 50:38.671
- Can you make my hair look like this?
- Why would you want that?

50:38.879 --> 50:41.048
I like your hair, it's natural

50:41.257 --> 50:45.177
I wish more children would wear their
hair natural, like Martin Luther King.

50:45.386 --> 50:51.183
You ain't never seen Martin Luther King
with no messy curls on his head.

50:51.392 --> 50:55.729
- I met Dr Martin Luther King once.
- You're lying, you ain't never met him.

50:55.938 --> 50:58.941
I met him in 1962
in Memphis, Tennessee.

50:59.149 --> 51:01.944
I'm walking down the street
minding my own business.

51:02.152 --> 51:04.863
I walk round the corner,
and a man hits me in the chest.

51:05.072 --> 51:07.658
I fall on the ground. I look up,
and it's Martin Luther King.

51:07.866 --> 51:11.370
I said, "Dr King." He said,
"Oops, I thought it was someone else."

51:11.579 --> 51:14.415
- You never met Martin Luther King.
- He knocked me over.

51:14.623 --> 51:17.042
- No, he didn'.
- Yes, he did.

51:17.251 --> 51:19.086
Why do you worry about how you look?

51:19.295 --> 51:23.591
I'm trying to gain the interest
of a certain young lady.

51:23.799 --> 51:27.261
I ain't heard no woman give no man
no lovin' 'cause his hair looks good.

51:27.469 --> 51:31.098
- That's right.
- Is this an American girl

51:32.808 --> 51:36.770
You got to go through her papa. People
don't know that about American women.

51:36.979 --> 51:38.814
Ain't nothing to do with your hair
or your pocket.

51:39.023 --> 51:43.402
You get in good with American
woman's father, you in good with her.

51:43.611 --> 51:46.947
Get in good with the father,
you home free.

51:47.156 --> 51:50.284
- Home free.
- Like a bird.

52:00.628 --> 52:03.505
- Mr McDowell.
- What is it?

52:04.465 --> 52:09.428
Sir, did you catch the professional
football contest on television last night?

52:10.888 --> 52:13.891
- No, I didn'.
- It was most exhilarating.

52:14.099 --> 52:17.061
The Giants of New York
took on the Packers of Green Bay.

52:17.269 --> 52:22.274
The Giants triumphed by kicking
an oblong pigskin ball through a big "H".

52:22.483 --> 52:24.568
It was a ripping victory.

52:26.862 --> 52:31.116
Son, and I'm just going
to tell you this one time.

52:31.325 --> 52:34.495
You want to keep working here,
stay off the drugs.

52:35.955 --> 52:38.374
Yes, sir.

52:43.754 --> 52:48.259
I don't know how it is in Africa,
but here rich guys get all the chicks.

52:53.681 --> 52:58.227
- He must work very hard.
- The Prince of Soul Glo?

52:58.435 --> 53:02.690
No way.
He lives off his father's invention.

53:02.898 --> 53:08.028
He can buy her anything he wants. How
are you going to compete with that?

53:35.264 --> 53:37.725
I'll get it.

53:45.357 --> 53:48.319
- Delivery for Miss Lisa McDowell.
- I'll take it, I'm her sister.

53:48.527 --> 53:51.155
Would you sign here, please?

53:59.413 --> 54:03.250
- What is it?
- Something for you.

54:03.459 --> 54:06.420
Do you mind if I open it?

54:10.674 --> 54:13.928
- Do you think they're real
- They couldn't be.

54:17.139 --> 54:20.392
"From an admirer. Not Darryl"

54:20.601 --> 54:23.646
- Somebody's messing around.
- I am not.

54:24.563 --> 54:26.774
I don't care
how much a man admires you.

54:26.982 --> 54:30.903
He's not giving you earrings like that
unless you've given him booty.

54:31.111 --> 54:36.951
- Not everybody thinks like you.
- They do, but they don't admit it.

54:54.343 --> 54:58.305
Do you realise I have not had sex
since we got to America?

54:58.514 --> 55:01.433
Semmi, look. There she is.

55:02.476 --> 55:04.937
- I'm going to talk to her.
- Good.

55:05.145 --> 55:07.731
Tell her you sent her the 500,000 dollar
pair of earrings.

55:07.940 --> 55:12.111
She will fall into your arms, and we
can leave this god-forsaken place.

55:12.319 --> 55:14.154
- I cannot do that.
- Do something.

55:14.363 --> 55:19.076
- Do not worry, I have a plan.
- To mop your way into her heart?

55:19.285 --> 55:22.788
- That's not fair.
- Nor is me doing manual labour.

55:24.665 --> 55:27.960
- I'm badly in need of a manicure.
- Listen to you...

55:28.168 --> 55:31.130
"I'm badly in need of a manicure."

55:31.338 --> 55:34.592
Are you going to say something?

55:38.304 --> 55:43.017
- Hey, Akeem! This is my sister, Patrice.
- Hello, how are you?

55:43.225 --> 55:47.062
- Akeem's from Africa.
- What are you doing in New York?

55:47.271 --> 55:50.649
- I'm a student.
- What school are you going to?

55:50.858 --> 55:53.694
I go to the University.

55:53.903 --> 55:55.487
Which one?

55:57.615 --> 56:00.409
The University of the United States.

56:02.161 --> 56:04.371
I've never heard of that.

56:04.580 --> 56:08.125
It's a very small university.
We don't even have a basketball team.

56:08.334 --> 56:13.756
Really? We've got an extra ticket
for the St. John's game. Want to come?

56:15.299 --> 56:16.842
Yes.

56:17.051 --> 56:20.596
You can double -date
with me and Darryl

56:46.497 --> 56:48.791
In his face! In his face!

56:48.999 --> 56:51.752
Yes! In the face!

56:55.256 --> 56:58.342
Why don't you take off yourjacket,
Akeem?

56:58.550 --> 57:02.054
"Put it in the face," right? I like this.

57:03.097 --> 57:06.308
- Isn't that better?
- Yes, thank you very much.

57:14.024 --> 57:17.695
Wearing clothes must be
a new experience for you.

57:17.903 --> 57:21.949
- Are you able to follow the game?
- Oh, yes!

57:22.157 --> 57:25.411
I'm following the game quite well.

57:27.246 --> 57:31.208
What kind of games do you play
in Africa? Chase the monkey?

57:32.626 --> 57:36.005
No, we play football.
I believe you call it soccer.

57:36.213 --> 57:38.090
Yeah, right. Soccer.

57:38.299 --> 57:44.221
That's a real cute sport. Especially the
way you bounce the ball off your heads.

57:44.430 --> 57:48.392
I don't like any sport
where you don't use your hands.

57:49.560 --> 57:51.979
Yes! Yes!

57:52.187 --> 57:56.108
What are you doing?
It's just the half -time?

57:57.151 --> 58:01.238
This is my favourite part of the game.
Will you excuse me for a moment?

58:01.447 --> 58:05.034
Excuse me. I'll be back in a minute.

58:19.506 --> 58:22.843
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness, it is you!

58:23.928 --> 58:26.263
I cannot believe it.

58:29.308 --> 58:33.228
- Greetings, your Highness.
- Please, stop bowing.

58:33.437 --> 58:37.608
- I am a loyal citizen of Zamunda.
- You will spill your beverages.

58:38.734 --> 58:41.904
This is the greatest day of my life.

58:42.821 --> 58:46.867
It was very nice meeting you, too.
Excuse me.

58:50.454 --> 58:55.125
Please! Please, may I just have
my picture taken with you?

59:06.512 --> 59:12.101
I will cherish this experience
for the rest of my life.

59:18.065 --> 59:20.943
For the rest of my life.

59:23.404 --> 59:27.825
- Who was that?
- Just a man I met in the restroom.

59:35.499 --> 59:39.837
- Why don't you quit this job?
- Because I like it here.

59:40.045 --> 59:43.841
But you're my lady.
My lady doesn't have to work.

59:45.175 --> 59:48.721
I'll take care of you.
Get you anything you want.

59:49.972 --> 59:52.891
- What can I get you?
- Nothing.

59:54.852 --> 59:57.980
I'll get you some... coffee.

59:59.356 --> 01:00:02.109
I'll be right back.

01:00:09.033 --> 01:00:12.036
Hey, Akeem. Did you have
a good time at the game?

01:00:12.244 --> 01:00:13.662
Yes, I did.

01:00:13.871 --> 01:00:17.458
I hope Darryl didn't offend you.
He can be pretty obnoxious.

01:00:17.666 --> 01:00:21.712
- He cannot help it.
- Sit down, take a break for a minute.

01:00:25.424 --> 01:00:27.885
You're an unusual guy.

01:00:28.093 --> 01:00:31.221
I've never seen anybody take
so much pride in mopping a floor.

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:35.517
"He who would learn to fly
must first learn to stand and walk."

01:00:35.726 --> 01:00:40.606
"One cannot fly into flying."
That's not mine, that's Nietzsche's.

01:00:40.814 --> 01:00:44.652
That's what I mean. The guys
that work here don't quote Nietzsche.

01:00:49.782 --> 01:00:53.118
Everybody shut up and do what I say.

01:00:53.327 --> 01:00:57.831
Get the money out!
Stay cool, nobody gets hurt.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.501
Take the money out! All of it.

01:01:00.709 --> 01:01:03.796
Don't stall me, fat boy. Let's go.

01:01:04.004 --> 01:01:07.591
Come on! You're wasting my time.
Come on!

01:01:11.053 --> 01:01:14.056
Ahybody move,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

01:01:14.265 --> 01:01:17.518
What are you looking at, buddy?

01:01:19.395 --> 01:01:23.065
Come on! Stop stalling.

01:01:25.568 --> 01:01:29.738
Come on. Don't stall me. All of it!

01:01:34.827 --> 01:01:38.622
- Come on!
- Excuse me for a moment.

01:01:44.837 --> 01:01:46.797
It would be wise for you
to put the weapon down.

01:01:47.006 --> 01:01:49.216
Who is this asshole?

01:01:50.843 --> 01:01:55.556
Please refrain from using any more
obscenities in front of these people.

01:01:55.764 --> 01:01:58.434
I've warned you.
I'll be forced to thrash you.

01:01:58.642 --> 01:02:00.644
Fuck you!

01:02:05.941 --> 01:02:09.570
Freeze,
you diseased rhinoceros' pizzle.

01:02:21.874 --> 01:02:26.587
Hey, fellas. I'm real proud of the job
you did in there today.

01:02:26.795 --> 01:02:29.340
We've been hit by that guy five times,

01:02:29.548 --> 01:02:34.511
but I don't think he's coming back,
thanks to my African connections.

01:02:36.263 --> 01:02:41.852
Leave Sunday night open.
I'm having a get-together at my house.

01:02:43.562 --> 01:02:45.689
You see?
He has accepted us as equals.

01:02:48.525 --> 01:02:53.322
OK, fellas. Give them a ticket, take their
keys and park the cars down the street.

01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:56.367
When you're finished, come inside
and help out in the kitchen.

01:02:56.575 --> 01:03:02.414
Akeem, I want to show you
the inside of McDowell's little castle.

01:03:07.211 --> 01:03:12.383
This here is my showplace.
It pretty much speaks for itself.

01:03:13.634 --> 01:03:20.266
When I grew up, nine of us lived
in a shack no bigger than this room.

01:03:20.975 --> 01:03:24.144
And look what I have today.

01:03:24.353 --> 01:03:27.606
I only wish Mrs McDowell
could have lived to see it.

01:03:27.815 --> 01:03:31.652
- You have a fine house, sir.
- Thank you.

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:37.366
In 20 or 30 years, with hard work,
maybe you could have a place like this.

01:03:40.953 --> 01:03:43.539
- That would be something.
- Wouldn't it?

01:03:47.501 --> 01:03:51.130
This is where you're going
to be working tonight.

01:03:59.722 --> 01:04:04.518
- Ever open a champagne bottle?
- I have seen it done before.

01:04:04.727 --> 01:04:07.521
Make sure you keep all the glasses full.

01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:12.151
I'd better get dressed. Make yourself
comfortable 'til the guests arrive.

01:04:15.321 --> 01:04:20.993
I love the Lord. Do you understand
what I'm saying? I love the Lord.

01:04:21.201 --> 01:04:25.164
And if loving the Lord is wrong,
I don't want to be right.

01:04:25.372 --> 01:04:30.961
Hi, Mike. Good to see you. Enjoy, drink
up. Lots more where that came from.

01:04:31.211 --> 01:04:35.382
Hey, Randy! Good to see you.
Watch out for this guy.

01:04:35.591 --> 01:04:37.384
Big Ed, my man!

01:04:38.427 --> 01:04:42.848
You know, I can appreciate the way
you handled that dude with the gun.

01:04:43.474 --> 01:04:46.352
I would've helped you out, except...

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:49.605
I had a cup of coffee in my hand.
You understand, right?

01:04:49.813 --> 01:04:55.527
I bet you learnt all that stuff
fighting lions and tigers and shit.

01:04:55.736 --> 01:04:59.365
Yes, where I'm from,
we have to be very aggressive.

01:04:59.573 --> 01:05:03.244
I'm all for that. Especially with women.

01:05:04.036 --> 01:05:06.830
They may not admit it...

01:05:07.039 --> 01:05:11.794
...but they all want
a man to take charge.

01:05:16.507 --> 01:05:19.593
Tell them what to do.

01:05:27.434 --> 01:05:29.645
That's one of the things
I want to talk to you...

01:05:29.853 --> 01:05:34.358
Darryl, your mother gets lovelier
every time I see her.

01:05:34.567 --> 01:05:39.530
- Cleo, I'd like to talk to you alone.
- Sure. Excuse us.

01:05:39.738 --> 01:05:43.033
- Mum, Dad, Grandma...
- Sure, son.

01:05:43.242 --> 01:05:47.580
I like the fries better at McDonald's,
but I'd never tell Mr McDowell that.

01:05:49.707 --> 01:05:52.710
Make sure everybody's glass
is kept full.

01:05:52.918 --> 01:05:56.672
We're about to make
a very special announcement.

01:06:01.218 --> 01:06:04.513
May I have
everyone's attention, please.

01:06:08.225 --> 01:06:13.564
Mr and Mrs Jenks, would you join me?
Mother Jenks, you come up here, too.

01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:26.452
I've just heard some news
that makes me a very happy man.

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:28.203
Semmi, please...

01:06:30.748 --> 01:06:33.083
Champagne.

01:06:34.251 --> 01:06:37.171
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:06:37.379 --> 01:06:40.841
Okay, get going. Get out of here. Go on.

01:06:42.968 --> 01:06:48.724
As you know, Darryl and Lisa have
been going together for quite some time.

01:06:48.933 --> 01:06:54.104
I'm pleased to announce
that Darryl just popped the big question.

01:06:56.357 --> 01:06:59.652
And Lisa happily accepted.

01:07:06.951 --> 01:07:10.579
So as it turns out, this has become
an engagement party.

01:07:11.372 --> 01:07:14.959
Amen! Praise the Lord.

01:07:15.167 --> 01:07:19.338
- Married?
- To the bride and groom.

01:07:19.546 --> 01:07:21.548
To the bride and groom!

01:07:21.757 --> 01:07:23.884
To the bride and groom.

01:07:31.392 --> 01:07:35.562
I want you and that young man
to tie that knot. I'll pray for you.

01:07:35.771 --> 01:07:38.732
And I want you to hold on
to God's unchanging hand.

01:07:38.941 --> 01:07:42.611
'Cause he helped Joshua
fight the battle of Jericho.

01:07:43.862 --> 01:07:46.740
And he helped Daniel
get out of the lion's den.

01:07:46.949 --> 01:07:51.120
He helped Gilligan get off the island.
Lord!

01:07:51.328 --> 01:07:54.373
I want to talk to you, now!

01:08:04.466 --> 01:08:09.513
The next time you and my father
plan my life, let me in on it.

01:08:09.722 --> 01:08:12.099
- It's not like...
- Don't touch me!

01:08:12.308 --> 01:08:15.603
But baby, it's our engagement party.

01:08:26.822 --> 01:08:28.782
Thanks.

01:08:35.956 --> 01:08:41.502
- Would you like some champagne?
- No, I don't feel like celebrating.

01:08:44.006 --> 01:08:48.594
Wait. Sit down and keep me company.

01:08:57.478 --> 01:09:01.148
If you're going to hang out with me,
you've got to loosen up.

01:09:01.357 --> 01:09:04.193
I can be loose. See?

01:09:05.527 --> 01:09:07.529
Much better.

01:09:09.198 --> 01:09:12.158
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

01:09:12.368 --> 01:09:17.206
But I won't be pressured into marriage,
not by Darryl, my father or anybody.

01:09:18.165 --> 01:09:21.710
I understand.
In my country they arrange marriages,

01:09:21.919 --> 01:09:24.630
but no one should marry
out of obligation.

01:09:24.837 --> 01:09:30.469
You're right. How could I even have
considered marrying a guy like Darryl

01:09:30.678 --> 01:09:36.308
- I wondered the same thing.
- He made me so furious back there.

01:09:36.517 --> 01:09:41.522
- Do you think I overreacted?
- The first reaction is often correct.

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:47.694
You're very easy to talk to.
I feel like I could tell you anything.

01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:58.122
Hey, Akeem. We need
some more champagne over here.

01:09:59.915 --> 01:10:03.127
I almost forgot that I was here
in a domestic capacity.

01:10:03.335 --> 01:10:07.715
Thanks for listening to me, Akeem.
I really appreciate it.

01:10:07.923 --> 01:10:11.093
Ahy time, Lisa McDowell.

01:10:15.931 --> 01:10:18.517
Hey! Be careful

01:10:19.768 --> 01:10:23.105
I think my sister likes you.

01:10:30.446 --> 01:10:32.448
Semmi!

01:10:35.075 --> 01:10:37.119
Semmi.

01:10:41.832 --> 01:10:48.172
- Come, you're going to be late for work.
- So what if I am?

01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:53.177
We cannot anger Mr McDowell.
Things are going so well with Lisa.

01:10:53.385 --> 01:10:57.264
I do not care.
I'm not going to work today.

01:10:57.514 --> 01:11:00.601
Yes, you are going to work today.

01:11:01.644 --> 01:11:04.188
I'm sick of living like a peasant.
Look at this filth.

01:11:04.396 --> 01:11:08.859
Do you want to live better? Fine.
Fix this place up.

01:11:09.068 --> 01:11:11.737
But you are going to work today!

01:11:21.622 --> 01:11:23.791
- Hello!
- Hi!

01:11:23.999 --> 01:11:27.711
I started on clean-up just like you guys,
but now...

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:33.092
See, I'm washing lettuce.
Soon, I'll be on fries. Then the grill.

01:11:33.926 --> 01:11:36.971
In a year or two,
I'll make assistant manager

01:11:37.179 --> 01:11:40.474
and that's where the big bucks
start rolling in.

01:11:40.683 --> 01:11:43.519
Just two years, huh?

01:11:47.231 --> 01:11:52.611
Maybe I've stayed with him
because everyone expected me to.

01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:56.740
- You must be tired of my problems.
- No, not at all.

01:11:58.033 --> 01:12:00.786
I feel like I owe you a favour.

01:12:00.995 --> 01:12:05.916
Come to my house and I'll fix
you dinner. Patrice will be there.

01:12:06.125 --> 01:12:10.504
Let's go to my house.
I'd like to cook for you.

01:12:10.713 --> 01:12:14.341
- You cook?
- I dabble a little, yes.

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:17.469
Great! Tell you what,
I'll buy the groceries.

01:12:17.678 --> 01:12:23.017
Fine. But I have to warn you.
My home is very poor.

01:12:23.225 --> 01:12:27.521
I don't care about that.
I'd love to see where you live.

01:12:41.076 --> 01:12:44.079
Welcome to my humble abode.

01:12:52.796 --> 01:12:56.592
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:01.096
Everything's fine.
Excuse me for a moment, please.

01:13:05.351 --> 01:13:08.979
- What have you done?
- You told me to fix up the place.

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:14.818
I should kill you!
I'm supposed to be a poor man.

01:13:15.027 --> 01:13:18.030
Akeem? Akeem.

01:13:20.866 --> 01:13:23.077
- Is everything all right?
- Everything is fine.

01:13:23.285 --> 01:13:26.038
Excuse me, I have to tidy up.

01:13:42.221 --> 01:13:44.890
What are you doing?

01:13:47.017 --> 01:13:50.604
For God's sake,
do not take my pocket money.

01:13:55.276 --> 01:13:58.445
If you have no more money,
you can cause no more mischief.

01:13:58.654 --> 01:14:01.407
You are being unreasonable.

01:14:01.615 --> 01:14:07.538
If you have ruined my chances
with Lisa, I will never forgive you.

01:14:10.874 --> 01:14:13.377
- I'm very sorry.
- Can we go in now?

01:14:13.586 --> 01:14:16.630
- No, we cannot.
- Why not?

01:14:16.839 --> 01:14:20.259
There's a big rat inside.

01:14:20.467 --> 01:14:23.178
I think there is no rat.

01:14:23.387 --> 01:14:28.851
You're so ashamed of your apartment
you can't even let me see it.

01:14:29.059 --> 01:14:32.396
Once again, you have judged correctly.

01:14:32.605 --> 01:14:37.401
- If it bothers you, we can go out to eat.
- That would be much better.

01:15:03.218 --> 01:15:05.888
Excuse me for a moment, please.

01:15:15.439 --> 01:15:20.194
- What did you give him?
- I just gave him some pocket change.

01:15:34.875 --> 01:15:38.087
- Randolph...
- Leave me alone, Mortimer.

01:15:38.295 --> 01:15:41.257
Randolph! Randolph!

01:15:42.967 --> 01:15:47.012
- I'm still not talking to you.
- Look!

01:15:53.978 --> 01:15:57.356
Mortimer, we're back.

01:15:57.565 --> 01:16:00.276
Yeah!

01:16:00.985 --> 01:16:03.362
To America!

01:16:07.533 --> 01:16:09.660
Why did you come here?

01:16:09.868 --> 01:16:13.372
- To find something special
- it's a long way to travel

01:16:13.581 --> 01:16:18.335
No journey is too great,
when one finds what he seeks.

01:16:18.544 --> 01:16:22.965
- Does everyone in Africa talk like you?
- Why, do you not like it?

01:16:23.173 --> 01:16:28.887
I love it. It's nice to be with a man
who knows how to express himself.

01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:31.849
- Thank you!
- Thank you very much!

01:16:32.057 --> 01:16:34.476
Let's have lunch.

01:16:37.813 --> 01:16:41.150
You have the most amazing effect
on people.

01:16:41.358 --> 01:16:46.322
- No, I don'.
- Take the guy at the basketball game.

01:16:46.530 --> 01:16:49.158
People love you.

01:16:50.117 --> 01:16:54.788
I bet where you're from,
women throw themselves at your feet.

01:16:54.997 --> 01:17:00.502
- Why do you say that?
- You have an inner glow.

01:17:00.711 --> 01:17:04.840
You're above anything petty.
It's almost regal

01:17:08.844 --> 01:17:15.517
- What did you do back home?
- I was... in the family business.

01:17:16.393 --> 01:17:20.272
- What's that?
- Goat herding.

01:17:21.273 --> 01:17:24.360
Yes, yes. Does it surprise you?

01:17:24.568 --> 01:17:27.738
No, it's just that you seem so educated.

01:17:27.947 --> 01:17:33.118
The life of a goat herder is easy,
the goats take care of themselves.

01:17:33.327 --> 01:17:37.456
Which leaves a man
with a great deal of time to read.

01:17:40.292 --> 01:17:44.004
- Please, let me.
- No, I should pay.

01:17:44.213 --> 01:17:47.800
Akeem, I wish you'd stop
worrying about being poor.

01:17:48.008 --> 01:17:51.804
If I wanted a wealthy guy,
I'd be with Darryl

01:17:52.012 --> 01:17:54.348
Not you.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:03.566
- Would you like to dance?
- Yes.

01:18:31.802 --> 01:18:34.763
What about Patrice?

01:18:34.972 --> 01:18:38.475
I'm not interested in Patrice.

01:18:39.852 --> 01:18:42.479
What about Darryl

01:18:42.688 --> 01:18:46.066
I'm not interested in Darryl, either.

01:19:11.717 --> 01:19:16.055
- Do you actually want to send this?
- Why? What is wrong?

01:19:16.263 --> 01:19:17.890
Read it to me.

01:19:18.098 --> 01:19:23.812
"To his Majesty King Jaffe Joffer,
the Royal Palace, Zamunda."

01:19:24.021 --> 01:19:28.150
"Sire, Akeem and I
have depleted our funds."

01:19:28.359 --> 01:19:32.321
"Kindly send 300,000 American dollars
immediately,"

01:19:32.529 --> 01:19:36.909
"as we are in dire straits.
Your humble servant, Semmi."

01:19:37.117 --> 01:19:39.495
Semmi.

01:19:39.703 --> 01:19:44.458
- Should I make it 400,000?
- Do you think that'll be enough?

01:19:44.667 --> 01:19:47.336
You are right. 500,000.

01:19:48.212 --> 01:19:51.548
As long as you're asking,
why not go for a cool million?

01:19:51.757 --> 01:19:56.053
- Don't you think that's too much?
- Nah.

01:20:02.434 --> 01:20:05.020
Okay, what's going on?

01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:07.690
Patrice...

01:20:09.692 --> 01:20:11.986
I came to see Akeem.

01:20:12.194 --> 01:20:16.448
What are you involved in?
You can't afford this on your salary.

01:20:19.368 --> 01:20:23.831
Someone to kiss
Someone to miss

01:20:24.039 --> 01:20:28.043
When you're away
Through here, gone each day

01:20:28.252 --> 01:20:33.424
To be loved, to be loved
Wow! What a feeling

01:20:33.632 --> 01:20:38.971
- Qu¡et! People are try¡ng to sleep.
- Some w¡sh to be a k¡ng or a queen

01:20:39.179 --> 01:20:42.182
- Some w¡sh for fortune and fame
- Shut up!

01:20:42.391 --> 01:20:47.271
But to be truly, truly, truly, truly loved

01:20:47.479 --> 01:20:51.150
it must mean all of these things

01:20:53.027 --> 01:20:57.072
Someone to care
Someone to share

01:20:57.281 --> 01:21:01.911
Lonely hours and moments of despair

01:21:02.119 --> 01:21:08.000
To be loved, to be loved
Wow! What a feeling

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:12.755
Semmi, I just had the most wonderful...

01:21:14.214 --> 01:21:18.677
Hi, Akeem. Semmi told me everything.

01:21:20.012 --> 01:21:24.850
Sorry things didn't work out between
you and me, but you understand.

01:21:25.059 --> 01:21:28.687
Goodnight, sweet prince.

01:21:35.819 --> 01:21:38.781
Remember, you must not tell a soul

01:21:38.989 --> 01:21:44.203
Your secret is safe with me,
your Highness. Bye...

01:21:52.086 --> 01:21:55.130
If you're the prince, then who am I

01:21:58.175 --> 01:22:00.678
My servant.

01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:16.986
They smell good. Darryl must be
spending a fortune on flowers.

01:22:17.194 --> 01:22:19.863
Stay out of this, Dad.

01:22:20.072 --> 01:22:23.951
- Where are you going?
- To a museum. With Akeem.

01:22:24.159 --> 01:22:28.289
- I don't like that one bit.
- What's wrong with Akeem?

01:22:29.373 --> 01:22:32.334
You told me yourself.
He's a goat herder.

01:22:33.627 --> 01:22:38.632
Why don't you marry Darryl
He dresses nice, he treats you good.

01:22:38.841 --> 01:22:42.219
You only like Darryl because he's rich.

01:22:43.554 --> 01:22:47.850
I don't want you to have to struggle
like your mother and I did.

01:22:48.058 --> 01:22:51.478
I know. Bye, Daddy.

01:22:58.485 --> 01:23:00.696
Come in.

01:23:02.948 --> 01:23:07.745
- You boys wanted to see me.
- We would like to change apartments.

01:23:09.496 --> 01:23:12.291
Goddamn! What the hell
have you done in here?

01:23:12.499 --> 01:23:17.046
My friend Semmi has altered the
apartment, so we would like to change.

01:23:17.254 --> 01:23:18.923
This stuff ain't hot, is it?

01:23:19.131 --> 01:23:25.220
No, but I'm bringing a young lady up,
and she can't see me living like this.

01:23:26.847 --> 01:23:32.937
I'll let you boys stay in my apartment
and I'll move up here.

01:23:33.145 --> 01:23:38.484
- Does your apartment look poor?
- It's a real shithole. You'll love it.

01:23:39.777 --> 01:23:45.366
Here are the keys. It's apartment 1 A.
Downstairs. First floor.

01:23:45.574 --> 01:23:49.411
Thank you, you're too kind.
Semmi, move our things.

01:23:57.461 --> 01:24:00.756
I have a date with Lisa.
Isn't that wonderful

01:25:19.627 --> 01:25:22.922
Who in the hell is that?

01:25:33.182 --> 01:25:39.313
What's up, brother? You're a little late
for the Christmas pageant.

01:25:43.275 --> 01:25:46.195
I'm King Jaffe Joffer, ruler of Zamunda.

01:25:46.403 --> 01:25:50.532
Have a seat. Chair number two
will be ready in a second.

01:25:53.869 --> 01:25:56.747
This is beautiful What is that - velvet?

01:25:58.916 --> 01:26:01.126
I have come for my son Akeem.

01:26:01.335 --> 01:26:06.173
- Who?
- You know, Kunta.

01:26:06.382 --> 01:26:12.596
- The boy upstairs.
- He live upstairs on the fifth floor.

01:26:15.015 --> 01:26:18.102
Who's going to clean up the flowers?

01:26:27.528 --> 01:26:30.155
You may enter.

01:26:36.954 --> 01:26:40.833
- You are not Akeem.
- I know that.

01:26:49.383 --> 01:26:52.761
- What is this?
- A photograph.

01:26:52.970 --> 01:26:55.055
What is this "McDowell's"?

01:26:55.264 --> 01:27:00.436
It's a place over on Queens Boulevard.
I think he works there.

01:27:00.644 --> 01:27:03.564
My son works?!

01:27:03.772 --> 01:27:09.361
- Where is he now?
- He moved to apartment 1 A.

01:27:20.581 --> 01:27:24.001
Your Majesty.
What are you doing here?

01:27:24.209 --> 01:27:27.296
I received your telegram.
Where is Akeem?

01:27:28.714 --> 01:27:32.593
He went out. How was your flight?
Comfortable, I trust.

01:27:32.801 --> 01:27:37.765
Yourjob was to look after Akeem.
How could you let this happen?

01:27:37.973 --> 01:27:41.602
Akeem will not listen to me,
he's gone quite mad.

01:27:43.229 --> 01:27:45.064
Semmi...

01:27:45.272 --> 01:27:50.027
You've disgraced yourself,
and you must be punished.

01:27:50.986 --> 01:27:56.158
You will confine yourself to our
royal suite at the Waldorf-Astoria.

01:27:56.367 --> 01:28:01.497
See that he puts on some decent attire.
And bathe him thoroughly.

01:28:07.294 --> 01:28:09.713
Thank you, your Majesty!

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:15.970
Look, Zamunda!
That's where you're from, isn't it?

01:28:16.178 --> 01:28:19.848
- What's it like?
- It's the most beautiful place on earth.

01:28:20.057 --> 01:28:26.355
The people are very friendly, and you...
You, they would treat like a queen.

01:28:31.986 --> 01:28:34.822
People will see us.

01:28:35.447 --> 01:28:38.158
Then let them see. Lisa...

01:28:38.367 --> 01:28:40.452
- Let us go.
- Now?

01:28:40.661 --> 01:28:43.497
Yes. Right now.

01:28:59.513 --> 01:29:05.311
Darryl, come by the house tonight.
About 9 p.m.

01:29:06.186 --> 01:29:08.814
Lisa will be home by then.

01:29:09.023 --> 01:29:12.318
Don't worry about it,
we'll work something out.

01:29:12.526 --> 01:29:15.112
Okay, see you later.

01:29:20.826 --> 01:29:25.205
There's some people here to see you.

01:29:26.999 --> 01:29:30.336
- Are they from McDonald's?
- I don't think so.

01:29:37.384 --> 01:29:40.012
What can I do for you?

01:29:43.057 --> 01:29:45.643
This is King Jaffe Joffer,
ruler of Zamunda.

01:29:45.851 --> 01:29:50.147
- He's searching for his son Akeem.
- Your son?

01:29:50.356 --> 01:29:54.401
- Yes, my son, the Prince.
- Prince? Are you serious?

01:29:54.610 --> 01:29:57.446
Prince Akeem is the sole heir
to the throne of Zamunda.

01:29:57.655 --> 01:30:00.783
I knew there was something special
about that boy.

01:30:00.991 --> 01:30:05.996
- Can you tell us where he might be?
- He's out with my lovely daughter Lisa.

01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:11.919
I'm staying at the Waldorf-Astoria.
When you see him, call me.

01:30:12.127 --> 01:30:14.380
- I'll tell him you're here.
- No.

01:30:14.588 --> 01:30:19.301
Do not alert him to my presence.
I shall deal with him myself.

01:30:25.182 --> 01:30:30.187
- For your trouble.
- Thank you, your Royalness.

01:30:40.698 --> 01:30:42.241
A prince!

01:31:04.597 --> 01:31:07.391
Wait! We cannot go in.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.518
Why not?

01:31:09.727 --> 01:31:12.813
Wait in the car. I will be right back.

01:31:22.948 --> 01:31:25.284
- We must leave.
- I don't care about the apartment.

01:31:25.492 --> 01:31:28.203
It's not that. I feel like I'm rushing you.

01:31:28.412 --> 01:31:30.497
No, you're not.

01:31:31.373 --> 01:31:35.044
- It's better if we take our time.
- But I want to.

01:31:35.252 --> 01:31:38.172
It's better if I take you home.

01:31:44.553 --> 01:31:49.391
Look who's here!
Akeem, it's good to see you.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.519
- It's good to see you, too.
- Have a drink.

01:31:52.728 --> 01:31:57.316
- I have to get going, Mr McDowell.
- You have time for one drink.

01:31:57.524 --> 01:31:59.193
Get out of here, dog.

01:31:59.401 --> 01:32:01.654
We don't spend enough time talking.

01:32:01.862 --> 01:32:04.448
Perhaps some other time,
I have to get going.

01:32:04.657 --> 01:32:08.202
Sit down,
I'll be right back with that drink.

01:32:25.719 --> 01:32:28.639
King Jaffe Joffer's room, please.

01:32:30.808 --> 01:32:33.727
Hello, King. Cleo McDowell here.

01:32:33.936 --> 01:32:37.106
Both the kids are here, together.

01:32:37.314 --> 01:32:43.070
2432 Derby Avenue,
Jamaica Estates. Right.

01:32:43.279 --> 01:32:46.991
King, I was wondering if... Hello, King?

01:32:50.619 --> 01:32:53.914
- I really have to go, sir.
- No. Have a seat right here.

01:32:54.123 --> 01:32:56.625
Did you want ice in that?

01:32:56.834 --> 01:32:59.253
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

01:33:10.848 --> 01:33:13.976
- Who was that?
- Jehovah's Witness.

01:33:15.394 --> 01:33:17.146
Excuse me.

01:33:23.402 --> 01:33:27.239
She doesn't like you anymore.
Get that through your greasy head!

01:33:27.448 --> 01:33:30.117
But you told me to come over.

01:33:32.828 --> 01:33:34.788
Now, where were we?

01:33:50.304 --> 01:33:53.015
I warned you, didn't I? Dottie, get him!

01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:05.819
I appreciate your hospitality,
but I have to get going.

01:34:06.028 --> 01:34:07.988
You can stay a little while longer.

01:34:08.197 --> 01:34:12.201
I just put some delicious hors d'oeuvres
in the oven... son.

01:34:13.285 --> 01:34:15.537
Let me go see if they're ready.

01:34:19.083 --> 01:34:22.127
- Lisa, I must leave.
- Is something wrong, Akeem?

01:34:23.212 --> 01:34:25.798
I'll tell you when the time is right,
but now I must go.

01:34:26.006 --> 01:34:29.009
Tell your father goodbye for me.

01:34:32.555 --> 01:34:34.848
- Where's Akeem?
- He had to leave.

01:34:35.057 --> 01:34:38.978
- He can't leave!
- What is going on?

01:34:39.186 --> 01:34:42.690
And why are you so nice to Akeem
all of a sudden?

01:34:42.898 --> 01:34:45.401
I like the boy.

01:34:45.609 --> 01:34:48.821
- What are you up to?
- What? Nothing.

01:34:49.029 --> 01:34:51.490
A man's got a right
to change his mind.

01:34:51.699 --> 01:34:56.036
- Daddy...
- You two make a beautiful couple.

01:34:56.245 --> 01:34:59.873
- Daddy...
- He's a real fine young man.

01:35:00.082 --> 01:35:06.213
- Dad!
- Okay, Lisa. He's rich. He is rich!

01:35:06.422 --> 01:35:09.049
- What?
- He's got his own money.

01:35:09.258 --> 01:35:15.055
When I tell you he's got his own money,
I mean the boy has got his own money.

01:35:22.438 --> 01:35:25.608
A prince. He's a prince!

01:35:28.110 --> 01:35:31.447
Lisa, you did it this time.
You hit the jackpot!

01:35:31.655 --> 01:35:35.492
Your goat herder makes Darryl
look like a welfare case.

01:35:49.214 --> 01:35:51.675
I will get out here.

01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:55.930
That'll be nine bucks.

01:36:17.952 --> 01:36:21.038
Good news, Akeem.
We've been rescued.

01:36:21.247 --> 01:36:26.210
- Where are my parents?
- They've gone to the McDowell's.

01:36:26.418 --> 01:36:28.545
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

01:36:28.754 --> 01:36:30.673
Back to Queens.

01:36:32.049 --> 01:36:35.511
Look who's here! Come in, come in.

01:36:35.719 --> 01:36:38.514
Welcome to Casa de McDowell's.
Come right in.

01:36:48.524 --> 01:36:51.402
- Where is Akeem?
- He just stepped out.

01:36:51.610 --> 01:36:55.698
Probably went for a pizza.
You know these youngsters.

01:36:55.906 --> 01:36:59.618
This must be your lovely wife.
How are you today?

01:36:59.827 --> 01:37:01.787
Very well, thank you.

01:37:01.996 --> 01:37:06.792
I don't know whether to shake
your hand, kiss it or bow or what.

01:37:07.001 --> 01:37:10.212
I feel like break dancing.

01:37:10.421 --> 01:37:16.260
Come in, have a seat, take a load off.
Your son ought to be back in a minute.

01:37:16.468 --> 01:37:20.180
- Try the Lazy-Boy. It's comfortable.
- It's very nice.

01:37:20.389 --> 01:37:22.182
Put your feet up.

01:37:29.857 --> 01:37:32.568
Here you go, King.
Try one of these pigs in a blanket.

01:37:32.776 --> 01:37:34.987
They're the frozen kind,
but you'd never know it.

01:37:35.195 --> 01:37:38.032
You told me my son was here.

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:42.870
My daughter Lisa might know where
he went. They've gotten quite close.

01:37:43.078 --> 01:37:46.040
Where is your daughter?
I must speak to her at once.

01:37:46.624 --> 01:37:49.460
Lisa?
There's someone here to see you.

01:37:55.674 --> 01:37:59.094
This is Akeem's father. The King!

01:37:59.303 --> 01:38:01.347
Leave us.

01:38:10.397 --> 01:38:14.068
- I understand you're seeing my son.
- I was seeing him.

01:38:14.276 --> 01:38:16.320
So you know about his wife
in Zamunda?

01:38:16.528 --> 01:38:18.989
- He's married?
- No, but he will be soon.

01:38:19.198 --> 01:38:23.118
We've already chosen his bride.
So you see...

01:38:23.327 --> 01:38:25.871
...he cannot be serious about you.

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:30.376
Akeem came to America to...
sow his royal oats.

01:38:31.835 --> 01:38:34.255
Excuse me, I need to be alone.

01:38:34.463 --> 01:38:38.801
Are you comfortable, Miss...
I'm not sure what to call you.

01:38:39.009 --> 01:38:44.181
- My name is Cleo.
- Nice to meet you. My name's Aoleon.

01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:47.059
Aoleon. Aeolon...

01:38:50.563 --> 01:38:55.901
Lisa, where are you going?
I want you to meet the Queen.

01:38:56.110 --> 01:39:02.116
- Are you all right, my dear?
- I'm sorry. I have to get out of here.

01:39:02.324 --> 01:39:04.952
What's the matter, baby?

01:39:10.165 --> 01:39:12.334
What did you say to my daughter?

01:39:12.543 --> 01:39:16.255
The truth. That Akeem
could not be interested in her.

01:39:16.463 --> 01:39:21.427
- How can you be so sure?
- Our son can't consort with such a girl

01:39:21.635 --> 01:39:24.138
Now, wait a minute!

01:39:25.347 --> 01:39:26.765
Oha...

01:39:30.102 --> 01:39:34.189
You have been inconvenienced,
and I'm prepared to compensate you.

01:39:34.398 --> 01:39:37.651
- Shall we say 1 million dollars?
- No way.

01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:41.322
- 2 million.
- You can't buy my daughter off.

01:39:41.530 --> 01:39:45.075
- Nonsense!
- Jaffe, apologise to Mr McDowell.

01:39:45.284 --> 01:39:48.829
I will not. The man is beneath me,
and so is his daughter.

01:39:49.038 --> 01:39:52.458
I don't give a damn who you are.
This is America, Jack.

01:39:52.666 --> 01:39:57.755
You say one more word about Lisa,
and I'll break my foot off in your ass.

01:39:59.131 --> 01:40:02.843
- Pardon me?
- What's everybody yelling about?

01:40:03.052 --> 01:40:07.097
Their son, the Prince, loves your sister,
but the King can't handle it.

01:40:07.306 --> 01:40:10.726
No, he's not.
The Prince is in love with me.

01:40:16.148 --> 01:40:19.318
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Mother. I'm fine.

01:40:19.526 --> 01:40:22.529
Why are you hugging him?
He's just the servant.

01:40:23.864 --> 01:40:27.201
He's the Prince.

01:40:28.619 --> 01:40:31.163
Who told you that?

01:40:37.503 --> 01:40:41.548
- You mean Akeem's the Prince?
- Yeah, and he's in love with Lisa.

01:40:41.757 --> 01:40:44.927
How come she always gets
the good ones?

01:40:47.805 --> 01:40:51.642
- Where is Lisa?
- Your daddy ran her off.

01:40:55.688 --> 01:40:58.691
- What did you tell her?
- It is of no consequence.

01:40:58.899 --> 01:41:03.362
- We shall return to Zamunda at once.
- I will not leave without Lisa.

01:41:03.571 --> 01:41:06.448
So you do care for her?

01:41:08.117 --> 01:41:11.078
Mother, I love her.

01:41:11.287 --> 01:41:13.914
Then go after her.

01:41:18.544 --> 01:41:23.549
- Akeem! I forbid you.
- Put a sock in it, Jaffe. The boy's in love.

01:41:49.992 --> 01:41:52.453
Darryl, what happened?

01:41:54.330 --> 01:41:58.959
- Lisa dumped me.
- I know. You poor thing.

01:42:01.003 --> 01:42:06.425
The first thing we have to do
is get you out of these wet clothes.

01:42:08.802 --> 01:42:10.763
Stop!

01:42:10.971 --> 01:42:12.932
Lisa!

01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:14.683
Lisa!

01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:22.233
I will be fine by myself.

01:43:13.075 --> 01:43:15.286
Lisa, please.

01:43:16.203 --> 01:43:19.290
I did not mean to hurt you.

01:43:19.498 --> 01:43:23.335
Well, at least I know
who gave me these.

01:43:23.544 --> 01:43:27.089
You can keep them,
'cause I don't want them...

01:43:27.298 --> 01:43:29.925
...and I don't want you.

01:43:46.692 --> 01:43:48.277
Just leave me alone!

01:43:48.485 --> 01:43:51.655
Lisa, please. I love you.

01:43:51.864 --> 01:43:54.199
What about the woman
you are supposed to marry?

01:43:54.408 --> 01:43:57.328
I don't love her.
Why do you think I came here?

01:43:57.536 --> 01:44:00.581
Your father told me -
to sow your royal oats.

01:44:00.789 --> 01:44:06.337
I came to America to find my bride.
I came to Queens to find you.

01:44:06.545 --> 01:44:10.716
So why did you lie to me? Why didn'
you just tell me you were a prince?

01:44:10.925 --> 01:44:14.386
I wanted you to love me for who I am.

01:44:14.595 --> 01:44:18.515
- I'm not sure who are.
- I'm the man you fell in love with.

01:44:18.724 --> 01:44:21.560
Should it matter that I am a prince?

01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.814
It shouldn', but I...

01:44:26.023 --> 01:44:31.487
Say you never loved me,
and I won't bother you again.

01:44:38.661 --> 01:44:41.956
It just wouldn't work out,
we're too different.

01:44:42.164 --> 01:44:44.625
You're royalty, for God's sake.

01:44:44.833 --> 01:44:46.794
Do you want me
to renounce my throne? I will.

01:44:47.002 --> 01:44:51.340
I renounce my throne. I am no longer
the Prince of Zamunda.

01:44:51.549 --> 01:44:53.801
I renounce my throne!

01:44:58.264 --> 01:45:01.141
Does this make you happy?

01:45:09.984 --> 01:45:13.404
I can't let you do that.

01:45:13.612 --> 01:45:16.490
I do not care about my crown.

01:45:16.699 --> 01:45:19.702
All I care about is you.

01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:22.538
Marry me, Lisa.

01:45:27.084 --> 01:45:32.631
- So, what do you think?
- Go on, honey. Take a chance.

01:45:45.644 --> 01:45:50.691
Look, I'm sorry. I can'.
Goodbye, Akeem.

01:45:58.073 --> 01:46:01.744
If you're really a prince, I'll marry you.

01:47:18.612 --> 01:47:23.659
Look at it this way. At least we learned
how to make French fries.

01:47:50.102 --> 01:47:53.063
You're still not speaking to me.

01:47:54.106 --> 01:47:57.484
- I only want our son to be happy.
- And so do I.

01:47:57.693 --> 01:48:01.155
Aoleon, please. It is out of our hands.
The girl told him no.

01:48:01.363 --> 01:48:04.617
After the way you treated her,
who could blame her?

01:48:04.825 --> 01:48:09.121
Even if she said yes, they still couldn'
marry. It's against the tradition.

01:48:09.330 --> 01:48:11.957
Well, it is a stupid tradition.

01:48:12.708 --> 01:48:17.004
- Who am I to change it?
- I thought you were the King.

01:49:40.754 --> 01:49:46.051
Your Highness.
We have not come to that part yet.

01:49:53.684 --> 01:49:57.730
Your Highness. Your Highness!

01:50:25.633 --> 01:50:28.135
Would you really
have given this up for me?

01:50:28.344 --> 01:50:31.847
Of course. If you like,
we can give it all up now.

01:50:34.892 --> 01:50:36.477
Nah!

01:51:45.379 --> 01:51:48.340
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Stop right there.

01:51:48.549 --> 01:51:51.135
Listen! Stop right there a minute.

01:51:51.343 --> 01:51:54.179
A man goes in to a restaurant.
Are you listening?

01:51:54.388 --> 01:51:58.893
A man goes into a restaurant.
He sits down and has a bowl of soup.

01:51:59.101 --> 01:52:01.812
He says to the waiter,
"Come, taste the soup".

01:52:02.021 --> 01:52:04.857
The waiter says, "Is there something
wrong with the soup?" "Taste the soup."

01:52:05.065 --> 01:52:08.110
"Is the soup too hot?"
"Will you taste the soup?"

01:52:08.319 --> 01:52:11.196
"Is the soup too cold?"
"Will you just taste the soup!"

01:52:11.405 --> 01:52:14.533
"All right, I'll taste the soup.
Where's the spoon?"

01:52:21.707 --> 01:52:24.418
What do you know from funny,
you bastard?

01:56:39.924 --> 01:56:41.967
