If a really big opportunity came up,

12:58.486 --> 13:00.613
would there be a way
to get some time off work?

13:00.697 --> 13:03.116
-<i>Absolutely not.</i>
-Amazing. Thank you. Bye.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.951
Hey, Mom.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.327
-Guess what?
-[Mom] <i>What?</i>

13:06.411 --> 13:09.205
I got invited to a writers' retreat
in Paris.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.832
-<i>Really?</i>
-Yes, really.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.417
<i>It's not a scam?</i>

13:12.500 --> 13:15.003
No, it's not a scam.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.297
It has a website.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.632
Hey, guys. Crazy plot twist.

13:19.716 --> 13:23.261
I got an e-mail today inviting me
to go on this retreat in Paris.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.888
I'm on my way to the airport.

13:30.018 --> 13:33.646
<i>So for this very chic beauty look,</i>
<i>we're gonna be taking this concealer.</i>

13:33.730 --> 13:35.815
<i>And we go dot, dot, dot.</i>

13:36.399 --> 13:38.276
<i>And dot there.</i>

Sir. Were you there at the Arc?
Do you think this was an act of terrorism?

Did you experience any of the attacks?

19:22.370 --> 19:25.331
We are live here

You okay, Daddy?

19:51.273 --> 19:52.692
Here you go.

19:53.484 --> 19:56.654
Just the way you like it
with the mini marshmallows.

19:57.613 --> 19:58.948
Wow. Thank you.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.743
You need to get that trauma
out of your muscles before it sticks.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.496
So, I'm booking you a massage
with Greta for tomorrow.

20:05.579 --> 20:08.290

to start taking these new supplements.

We could've lost her. Little baby girl.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.925
Sweetie, have you eaten yet?
Did they feed you on the plane?

20:18.008 --> 20:19.135
Not really.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.595
Maybe we could order Momofuku?

20:21.679 --> 20:22.888
Oh, of course.

20:22.972 --> 20:26.308
Harold, do you have
that, uh, app thing for the food?

20:26.392 --> 20:29.103
Seamless? [sniffs] Grubhub?

20:31.021 --> 20:33.149
I just can't believe
you posted that photograph

20:33.232 --> 20:34.608
five minutes before the bombs hit.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.902
I mean,
what if it had been five minutes later?

20:36.986 --> 20:38.028
Could you even imagine?

20:38.112 --> 20:39.905
-[Harold] Oh, God.
-It's-- It's a lot.

20:39.989 --> 20:43.200
It's pretty… [chuckles] …unbelievable.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.872
I was actually-- I was pretty close.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.834
So, I had just started
walking away when it--

20:51.917 --> 20:52.877
Oh!

20:52.960 --> 20:54.336
-[Harold sobs]
-You saw the blast?

20:54.420 --> 20:56.672
Yeah, I saw the-- I saw the blast.

-Are your ears okay?

20:59.717 --> 21:01.051
My-- What do you--

21:01.135 --> 21:02.303
No ringing?

21:02.803 --> 21:04.597
-A little.
-Harold, wha--

21:04.680 --> 21:06.724
What's the name
of that colleague of yours? The ENT?

21:06.807 --> 21:09.435
-Richard?
-No, no, no. Mom. They're gonna be fine.

21:09.518 --> 21:10.519
-I'm calling Helen.
-No.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.230
Yeah. Her husband's cousin
was at the Boston bombing.

21:13.731 --> 21:16.150
Well, he was at least
in Boston at the time.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.903
Actually, I think he used to go
to a support group.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.571
That'd be good for you, emotionally.

21:21.697 --> 21:22.740
-Peanut.
-Yeah?

21:23.449 --> 21:25.409
Wanna make things
a little bit easier for you.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.454
-Just any way I can.
-Thank you.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.001
Feels like Christmas.

21:34.585 --> 21:38.339
We might not have ever had
another Christmas together.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.818
-I just wanted to say good night.
-Okay. Night.

22:01.529 --> 22:02.613
Love you.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.036
I love you too.

I know I haven't said this
as much as I should,

22:14.333 --> 22:17.586

I'm so proud of you.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.256
[Harold] Me too, Peanut.

I was hit with this feeling.

Oh, Jesus.

-boom!

26:44.394 --> 26:45.771

-Whoa. Whoa.

It's just my ears are still ringing.

27:18.262 --> 27:21.640

27:21.723 --> 27:23.475
-Aw!

I'm really glad you're not dead.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.340
Me too.

27:57.384 --> 28:00.429
[chuckles] Ha.

28:04.391 --> 28:08.270
[Danni] <i>My name is Danni Sanders,</i>
<i>and on April 10th, I almost died,</i>

28:08.770 --> 28:11.023
<i>but something, or someone, saved me.</i>

28:11.607 --> 28:15.611
<i>Maybe it was a guardian angel,</i>
<i>or God, or Alan Rickman's ghost,</i>

28:15.694 --> 28:17.571
<i>but I don't think that I believe</i>
<i>in any of that.</i>

28:18.280 --> 28:21.283
<i>More likely, it was me who saved me.</i>

28:22.367 --> 28:23.577
<i>Not that I believe in myself either.</i>

28:23.660 --> 28:26.413
<i>But if all of this</i>
<i>has taught me something</i>…

28:27.080 --> 28:28.081
[chuckles]

28:28.582 --> 28:29.625
…<i>it's that maybe I should.</i>

28:31.501 --> 28:32.544
Oh, my God.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.965
This is me. Exclamation mark.

28:39.176 --> 28:41.136
[intermittent buzzing]

28:42.137 --> 28:44.139
[ghostly voice] <i>Neuf.</i>

29:02.491 --> 29:04.534
[phone vibrates repeatedly]

29:05.786 --> 29:09.790
-I will never forget what I saw that day.
-[guinea pig squeaks]

29:14.878 --> 29:16.213
What did I see that day?

29:19.258 --> 29:22.094
Okay. Survivor of bombing.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.514
Ew.

29:25.597 --> 29:26.598
Oh, my God.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.523
That's good. That's a good idea.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.905
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Hey, Mom. Hi, Mom.

29:41.989 --> 29:43.532
-<i>How are you, Danni?</i>
-Hi, Mom. Yeah.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.409
-No, I just had a quick question.
-<i>Uh-huh?</i>

29:45.492 --> 29:46.493
What--

29:46.994 --> 29:49.997
Do you remember what the name
of the support group is

29:50.080 --> 29:51.790
that Helen's husband used to go to?

30:07.556 --> 30:11.143
[survivor 1] …and the sounds were coming,
like, 30 seconds apart.

30:11.226 --> 30:14.187
I'm sure it was just
a wheel on the tracks.

30:14.688 --> 30:16.982
Everyone else was just, you know, annoyed.

30:17.899 --> 30:20.068
I physically started shaking.

30:20.569 --> 30:24.364
I got off the train.
I just walked uptown from Canal.

30:24.448 --> 30:27.951
I mean, I felt like such an idiot.
And I was late.

30:29.119 --> 30:31.663
-I was not getting back on that train.
-[chuckles]

30:31.747 --> 30:33.707
[leader]
Loud noises can be very triggering.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.126
I think a lot of us struggled with that.

30:36.877 --> 30:39.629
[survivor 2] I make my kids mute
the TV when they're gaming.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.759
They hate it.
But I can't get any work done

30:43.842 --> 30:47.179
when I'm hearing gunfire
or-- or explosions.

30:47.262 --> 30:49.056
You let your kids play those?

30:50.015 --> 30:53.435
You don't think that's normalizing
a culture that glorifies gun violence?

30:53.518 --> 30:56.396
Okay, why don't we all just take a second

30:56.480 --> 30:59.983
and welcome our new addition.

31:01.568 --> 31:02.569
Hi.

31:03.153 --> 31:04.279
Hi.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.490
-[leader] What's your name?
-Danni.

31:10.285 --> 31:13.413
I was in Paris last week
when the bombings hit at the Arc.

31:15.457 --> 31:18.460
Oh. I am so sorry. Do you--

31:19.252 --> 31:25.133
Do you wanna share anything about how
you're-- you're feeling, or your thoughts?

31:25.717 --> 31:27.511
Oh. [chuckles]

31:30.097 --> 31:32.516
I was just hoping to listen today.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.769
Of course. Of course, Danni.
In your own time.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.730
We're all survivors here.

31:39.981 --> 31:42.567
Charles, why don't you speak for a bit?

31:43.193 --> 31:46.405
Charles is one of our newer members.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.241
He just returned from the UK.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.244
He's also a bombing survivor.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.204
He was at the Ariana Grande concert.

31:56.540 --> 31:59.418
Look, it's not easy…

32:00.710 --> 32:01.711
okay?

32:03.004 --> 32:04.923
I mean, it's been years for me,

32:05.006 --> 32:07.384
and I still have to talk
about it every week.

32:10.804 --> 32:13.682
I'm sorry. That's not comforting. Um…

32:14.808 --> 32:16.268
It's not like--

32:17.310 --> 32:20.564
Your life doesn't end. Okay?

32:22.691 --> 32:25.026
I know that it probably feels
like that right now.

32:26.528 --> 32:27.654
It's just…

32:29.906 --> 32:31.241
Everything changes colors.

32:32.659 --> 32:35.120
Yes. That's-- Exactly.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.415
I never would have thought
to put it like that.

32:39.833 --> 32:42.043
What is it for you?

32:44.671 --> 32:45.839
Maybe purple.

32:47.507 --> 32:48.592
What's yours?

32:51.887 --> 32:53.054
Red.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.850
It's like everything is red forever.

32:58.477 --> 33:02.772
And on one hand,
it's really vivid and intense.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.861
But on the other,
everything feels completely…

33:10.155 --> 33:11.239
monochrome.

33:13.617 --> 33:14.951
You relate to that, Danni?

33:17.871 --> 33:18.997
I just--

33:21.124 --> 33:22.918
Sort of understand the monochrome bit.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.922
That's how everything is for me too.
But mine's like…

33:29.591 --> 33:31.051
gray all the time.

33:33.053 --> 33:35.931
And how does it feel
when the world looks that way to you?

33:37.349 --> 33:38.433
I don't know.

33:39.226 --> 33:40.810
Doesn't really feel like anything.

33:43.688 --> 33:44.773
Just sort of numb.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.613
Ugh.

33:52.781 --> 33:53.782
[chuckles]

33:55.617 --> 33:56.743
See you next week.

33:56.826 --> 33:59.579
Yeah. I will 100% be back.

34:00.121 --> 34:02.374
Rowan, I am so sorry to do this to you,

34:02.457 --> 34:04.626
but my daughter is such
a huge fan of yours.

34:05.126 --> 34:07.754
Would you mind taking a quick photo
with me for her?

34:07.837 --> 34:11.466
-Yeah, of course.
-Thanks. I really appreciate it.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.097
Where's my ChapStick? Maybe I dropped it.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.598
Oh!

34:18.682 --> 34:21.768
You guys almost forgot this last chair.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.396
-Here.
-Oh, you're so sweet. [chuckles]

34:24.479 --> 34:25.605
So, um…

34:27.399 --> 34:30.193
I'm Danni, by the way. Danni Sanders.

34:31.194 --> 34:33.780
-Rowan. Welcome to group.
-Thanks.

34:35.490 --> 34:38.785
Thanks for sharing today.
I know the first meeting can be hard.

34:39.703 --> 34:44.624
Do you guys do, like,
post-group coffee or…

34:44.708 --> 34:46.960
Actually I have to run
to this school rehearsal thing.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.336
-No worries, no worries.
-Next time.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.421
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.423
Maybe we can swap Insta handles
or numbers?

34:51.923 --> 34:52.966
Sure. Yeah.

34:53.466 --> 34:54.718
Okay. Yeah.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.642
Here. Just text me anytime, okay?

35:02.726 --> 35:03.810
Oh, thank you.

35:04.686 --> 35:06.187
Bye. I'll talk to you later.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.897
-See ya, Charles.
-[Charles] See ya.

35:15.780 --> 35:18.533
I'm actually free right now
if you wanna go grab that coffee.

35:19.534 --> 35:21.119
Oh, gosh.

35:21.953 --> 35:25.248
I forgot I have this thing
that I have to do. So…

35:25.832 --> 35:26.875
Yeah. Okay.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.836
Cool. Hey, did you want my Insta handle?

35:29.919 --> 35:31.546
Uh…

35:31.630 --> 35:35.634
It's "godisawomanmann."
Two Ns. "Godisawomanmann."

35:35.717 --> 35:36.718
[Danni] Okay.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.272
[contributor]
<i>Today we're talking about Rowan Aldren,</i>

35:49.356 --> 35:54.069
<i>a teen gun-safety activist,</i>
<i>poet and social influencer.</i>

35:54.152 --> 35:56.488
<i>After surviving the Oak Valley</i>
<i>school shooting in North Carolina,</i>

35:56.571 --> 35:59.658
<i>Rowan came to New York to partner</i>
<i>with the We've Had Enough organization</i>

35:59.741 --> 36:03.662
<i>to begin her fight for gun reform.</i>
<i>Here's a look.</i>

36:03.745 --> 36:04.788
[Rowan] <i>Two miles.</i>

36:06.206 --> 36:09.042
<i>You can be two miles from a gunshot</i>
<i>and still hear it.</i>

36:10.460 --> 36:12.504
<i>That day,</i>
<i>even if you were nowhere near it,</i>

36:12.587 --> 36:15.924
<i>I swear, you heard those bullets</i>
<i>loud enough to fear 'em.</i>

36:18.093 --> 36:19.386
<i>Two miles.</i>

36:20.887 --> 36:23.515
<i>But the 23 at my school</i>
<i>carried much farther.</i>

36:24.182 --> 36:27.394
<i>Maybe that's just how it sounds</i>
<i>when a child dies a martyr.</i>

36:28.603 --> 36:31.147
<i>And yet, it was quiet.</i>

36:32.399 --> 36:33.775
<i>Quieter than it should have been.</i>

36:34.859 --> 36:37.821
<i>We needed a riot</i>
<i>and all we got was a funeral hymn.</i>

36:38.780 --> 36:41.324
<i>And someone saying, "Hey,</i>
<i>couldn't one of you have tackled him?"</i>

36:43.493 --> 36:47.247
<i>Two miles. And yet not a word.</i>

36:48.373 --> 36:52.794
<i>I look up at the people in power</i>
<i>and ask how thick are your walls</i>

36:52.877 --> 36:55.088
<i>that you can't hear what I heard?</i>

36:56.464 --> 37:01.010
Well, here, behind our walls,
our lives were taken turn by turn.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.640
Have we earned your sympathy yet, sir?

37:08.101 --> 37:10.770
<i>There is more than one person at fault</i>
<i>for what happened to us.</i>

37:11.938 --> 37:14.983
<i>There is more than one person</i>
<i>who pulled the trigger on that gun.</i>

37:15.066 --> 37:16.609
And I have had enough.

37:17.110 --> 37:19.362
Enough pain. Enough corruption.

37:19.446 --> 37:21.489
<i>Enough death. Enough destruction.</i>

37:21.573 --> 37:25.493
<i>Enough sleepless nights,</i>
<i>still watching my friends die.</i>

37:26.494 --> 37:30.206
Enough of listening
to our politicians lie.

37:30.290 --> 37:31.374
Enough!

37:31.458 --> 37:33.084
[crowd cheering]

37:42.051 --> 37:43.136
[Danni] Hey.

37:43.845 --> 37:47.766
-Hey.
-That is such a cute hairpin. I'm dead.

37:47.849 --> 37:51.603
-Oh, thank you. I made it myself.
-Cool.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.397
-So-- No, you.
-So--

37:54.481 --> 37:56.107
I was just gonna say thank you
for meeting me.

37:56.191 --> 37:57.984
Yeah, of course. Of course.

37:58.985 --> 38:01.279
How are you-- How are you doing?

38:01.362 --> 38:02.614
I'm good. Yeah.

38:02.697 --> 38:06.034
-I mean, I'm managing, I guess. Yeah. But…
-Yes.

38:07.827 --> 38:10.705
Do you have family around?
You know, like, in New York?

38:10.789 --> 38:13.875
Yeah. My dad cries
whenever he sees me now though.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.544
And my mom keeps shipping me

38:16.628 --> 38:19.088
wellness supplements
that she reads about on goop.

38:19.172 --> 38:24.260
Okay, um, well, what about your friends?

38:26.805 --> 38:28.223
I mean, I'm seeing you, right?

38:29.724 --> 38:30.809
Right.

38:31.893 --> 38:32.977
So, you know…

38:41.402 --> 38:45.990
Hey, are you-- are you cool
if we, maybe, walk somewhere?

38:46.950 --> 38:48.076
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

38:48.827 --> 38:49.911
[Danni] That's a good idea.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.457
[Rowan] I'm glad you reached out.

38:54.541 --> 38:57.794
It's gonna be great to have someone
in group who's not, like, 50.

38:57.877 --> 39:01.047
Oh, that's-- No, I'm--
I don't think I'll--

39:02.131 --> 39:04.843
That was just, like,
a onetime thing for me. But--

39:05.343 --> 39:06.886
The support group? Why?

39:08.346 --> 39:11.391
I don't know.
Therapy never really worked for me.

39:13.726 --> 39:17.605
It's not therapy, okay?
It's better. It's-- It's family.

39:19.357 --> 39:23.528
Besides, I mean, who's gonna help me
explain TikTok references to the boomers?

39:23.611 --> 39:26.614
Is TikTok a-- Is it a topic
that comes up a lot in meetings?

39:26.698 --> 39:28.700
-Oh, you would be surprised.
-[chuckles]

39:30.785 --> 39:34.581
So, listen. I was kinda hoping I might
be able to get your advice on something.

39:35.123 --> 39:37.500
Full disclosure, I stalked you online.

39:38.751 --> 39:41.546
That poetry you do, it's crazy.
It sounds just like <i>Hamilton</i>.

39:42.964 --> 39:44.883
Yeah, it's-- it's called spoken word.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.801
Cool, cool, cool. I'm a writer too.

39:46.885 --> 39:47.886
Oh, cool.

39:47.969 --> 39:50.013
Yeah. And I actually have
this article due right now

39:50.096 --> 39:51.556
for the magazine that I'm working at.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.433
And I feel really stuck.

39:53.516 --> 39:54.893
Like, I just--

39:55.935 --> 39:58.688
I don't know if you could
give me any tips, or…

39:59.188 --> 40:00.440
It's about what happened?

40:01.149 --> 40:02.567
And I brought my laptop.

40:02.650 --> 40:06.487
I don't know. We could hole up
at one of those little writer-y cafés.

40:06.571 --> 40:07.655
You could be my coach.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.325
-Sure.
-Thank you. Okay.

40:10.408 --> 40:13.828
You know, actually,
I wanted to take you here first.

40:14.495 --> 40:16.331
I think it could be super helpful.

40:16.414 --> 40:19.375
Before you write, you have to deal with
why you're feeling stuck.

40:20.460 --> 40:23.504
-Oh, okay, so-- And then we'll go write?
-Yeah. Come on.

40:23.588 --> 40:24.589
Okay.

40:26.799 --> 40:28.259
What is this place?

40:28.760 --> 40:30.595
[Rowan]
How do you feel about breaking things?

40:31.262 --> 40:34.515
Fuck the Senate for not passing
that background check bill last week.

40:35.183 --> 40:37.435
[panting]

40:37.518 --> 40:38.561
Now you try.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.481
Oh. Um…

40:42.231 --> 40:43.316
Okay.

40:48.237 --> 40:49.781
Fuck the bombing in Paris.

40:49.864 --> 40:52.617
No, you're not mad enough, okay?
You have to feel it.

40:53.743 --> 40:58.456
Okay. What if I don't--
What if I don't feel angry?

40:59.207 --> 41:01.459
All right, then what do you feel?

41:02.710 --> 41:04.462
Well, I don't know. [scoffs]

41:08.508 --> 41:09.884
Numb.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.052
Still numb.

41:12.553 --> 41:15.598
Use that. Smash the numbness.

41:18.518 --> 41:19.978
[whispers] Smash the numbness.

41:24.691 --> 41:26.442
Good. Again.

41:28.403 --> 41:31.155
Yes. Okay, you feel that?
Keep going. Let it out!

41:32.407 --> 41:35.243
That's it. Let it out.
Yell if you want to.

41:37.286 --> 41:38.287
Fuck you.

that Avril Lavigne is oldies?

You talked about how sunny and clear
it was all morning before the bombings.

1:19:34.395 --> 1:19:38.232
Well, I remembered reading
it was raining right before the attacks.

1:19:38.983 --> 1:19:39.984

1:19:54.039 --> 1:19:55.374

all the names on the list,

1:20:08.220 --> 1:20:11.598
not a single one turned up anything
about writing, except yours.

1:20:11.682 --> 1:20:13.642

does nobody fact-check anything anymore?

Why would you do that?

1:20:29.450 --> 1:20:34.288

I never trusted you.

from Paris was sus as hell.

1:20:52.348 --> 1:20:54.808

It's a little rough, but I, um…

1:34:09.644 --> 1:34:10.937
I think it's more fitting.

1:34:16.901 --> 1:34:18.111
[exhales shakily]

1:34:26.411 --> 1:34:28.955
If you're not okay, that's okay.

1:34:29.539 --> 1:34:30.665
[inhales sharply]

1:34:31.708 --> 1:34:33.585
That's advice I gave.

1:34:34.210 --> 1:34:36.337
Six words that came out of my mouth

1:34:36.421 --> 1:34:39.007
that on that day
you snatched up like a handout.

1:34:40.091 --> 1:34:41.968
#IAmNotOkay.

1:34:42.677 --> 1:34:44.804
A sentence that resonated
with a nation-- No.

1:34:44.888 --> 1:34:47.265
A generation scared to wake up
in their own nation,

1:34:47.348 --> 1:34:50.602
determined of their own
inevitable termination.

1:34:52.145 --> 1:34:54.814
Smart move,
turning that fear into clickbait.

1:34:59.027 --> 1:35:03.239
But, God, I guess I am
just so used to being stolen from,

1:35:03.323 --> 1:35:06.659
that when I read my words in your voice,
I reposted 'em.

1:35:07.410 --> 1:35:09.078
And applauded as you boasted.

1:35:09.162 --> 1:35:11.789
Gave you a platform
that floated you right up to the top.

1:35:13.291 --> 1:35:14.959
And you never thought to stop?

1:35:16.502 --> 1:35:19.464
When you looked down at the bodies
that you used as props,

1:35:19.547 --> 1:35:23.134
when you looked into my eyes,
you just saw another voice to co-opt?

1:35:23.801 --> 1:35:28.431
You know, for someone who's not okay,
you seem okay with quite a lot, actually.

1:35:30.850 --> 1:35:34.187
And while I was blindsided,
why am I not surprised?

1:35:35.605 --> 1:35:38.483
Why is a story like yours
something we read every other night?

1:35:38.566 --> 1:35:41.027
Why do people like you get movies
on Netflix and Hulu,

1:35:41.110 --> 1:35:44.614
and people like me get told
to sit tight and wait for change?

1:35:44.697 --> 1:35:47.659
No, you don't know what that's like!
You can't take the mic!

1:35:47.742 --> 1:35:50.870
This is my time slot.
One more minute, right?

1:35:50.954 --> 1:35:52.664
[scattered whoops and cheers]

1:35:52.747 --> 1:35:54.123
[clapping]

1:35:57.001 --> 1:35:59.128
I have had everything stolen from me.

1:36:00.255 --> 1:36:02.048
Their breath, stolen.

1:36:02.882 --> 1:36:06.761
My breath, perpetually holding, wondering
if someone near me might be holding--

1:36:08.179 --> 1:36:09.764
I'm sorry.

1:36:09.847 --> 1:36:11.182
Is my trauma showing?

1:36:11.266 --> 1:36:14.018
Because I don't plan
on slowing or sitting down.

1:36:14.102 --> 1:36:17.730
This is my time to take back the words
that you stole from my mouth.

1:36:17.814 --> 1:36:21.276
You have never seen anything destroyed
except yourself!

1:36:23.695 --> 1:36:25.238
And that is of your own doing.

1:36:30.034 --> 1:36:33.246
So hell no. I am not okay.

1:36:37.625 --> 1:36:39.752
I think about her every single day.

1:36:45.049 --> 1:36:48.303
You know when the newspapers wrote
about my sister,

1:36:48.386 --> 1:36:49.929
they misspelled her name?

1:36:53.057 --> 1:36:55.935
And now you think her place
is something you can claim?

1:36:59.230 --> 1:37:02.442
Her body is in the ground,
and you think you're the same?

1:37:10.074 --> 1:37:13.244
I hope you realize that by doing this,
you've only given me more to say.

1:37:15.747 --> 1:37:17.915
So maybe one day I'll forgive you…

1:37:19.792 --> 1:37:22.086
but we will never be okay.

1:37:26.257 --> 1:37:28.051
[applause]

1:37:45.735 --> 1:37:46.736
Yes!

1:37:47.695 --> 1:37:48.696
Yes!

1:38:06.881 --> 1:38:09.133
You did that. You did it.

1:38:27.735 --> 1:38:29.612
