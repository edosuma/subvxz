00:32.032 --> 00:34.993
- Thanks, Officer.
Excuse me.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.453
Some kind of altercation.

00:36.494 --> 00:40.832
The hot dog got into
a dispute with the victim.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.459
- Did anybody witness it?

00:42.500 --> 00:44.085
- Patrons heard a commotion.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.129
They came over and
they found him like this.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.757
- Security cameras?
- Nothing so far.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.885
- Interview all the patrons.
- Okay.

00:51.926 --> 00:54.054
- Collect the footage
from surrounding vendors.

01:03.355 --> 01:05.648
- He went berserk, he--

01:05.690 --> 01:08.610
I just pushed him off of me,
I swear.

01:08.651 --> 01:11.237
- I need you to come with us
to the police station.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.697
- He just attacked me.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.075
- We can talk about it
at the station.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.118
- Is he dead?

01:17.160 --> 01:18.453
- It appears so.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.795
Keep him in the costume.

01:26.836 --> 01:27.921
- Really?
- Please.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.631
- Okay.

01:31.257 --> 01:34.302
Officer, just load him
in the front RMP.

See, I'll be with you shortly.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.470
- We know what happened?
- He'll tell me.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.264
- Oh, we just got a walk-up,
if you don't mind.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.350
She's in the break room.
She's a mother.

03:03.391 --> 03:06.478
Avi, you're good
with the mothers.

03:06.519 --> 03:13.568

03:20.575 --> 03:23.203
- Hello.
Detective Avraham.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.872
- Joel Hamlin.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.749
- I miss anything?
- No, he just started.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.751
- Oh, okay. Good.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.921
God help me,
I love watching Avi work.

03:34.422 --> 03:35.882
- Do I need a lawyer?

03:35.924 --> 03:38.051
- I wouldn't think so.

03:38.093 --> 03:41.221
Can you tell me how
the altercation began?

03:41.262 --> 03:43.640
- He made a comment about this,

03:43.682 --> 03:45.892
It wasn't even that clever.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.728
I sniped back.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.147
Next thing, he's attacking me.
So I pushed him off,

03:51.189 --> 03:53.900
and he fell, and...

03:53.942 --> 03:56.027
hit his head.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.363
- What was his comment?

03:58.405 --> 04:01.741
Do you remember?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.660
Do you remember what he said?

04:03.702 --> 04:06.579
- Something about
"wiener dick."

04:06.621 --> 04:10.041
Like I said,
not even that clever.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.002
- You get that a lot?

04:12.043 --> 04:14.087
Comments like this?

04:14.129 --> 04:15.338
- I do.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.966
- How long have you
been working as...

04:21.511 --> 04:23.930
Mr. Footlong?
Is that your actual title?

04:23.972 --> 04:25.890
- It is.

04:25.932 --> 04:29.227
- How long have you been
working as Mr. Footlong?

04:29.269 --> 04:31.021
- Almost six months.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.314
- And before that?

04:33.356 --> 04:38.653
- Before that,
I was COO at Stake Side,

04:38.695 --> 04:42.615
which closed down--COVID.

04:42.657 --> 04:46.453
- You have family, children?

04:46.494 --> 04:48.997
- Three kids.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.291
- A wife?
- We're divorced.

04:51.332 --> 04:54.669
- When did you divorce?

04:54.711 --> 04:58.590
- Recently.
It's been a difficult year.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.509
- What did you say
that caused him to attack you?

05:03.678 --> 05:05.138
- I don't really remember.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.849
- No one does
passive-aggressive like Avi.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.517
- You remember what he said,

05:09.559 --> 05:11.811
but you don't remember
what you said?

05:11.853 --> 05:15.815
- I don't really remember.
It all happened so fast.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.901
All I know is that
he just came at me.

05:17.942 --> 05:19.527
- And you pushed him off?
- That's right.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.613
- Did you punch him?

05:21.654 --> 05:24.157
- No--I just pushed him, I--

05:24.199 --> 05:26.576
you know, shoved him.

05:26.618 --> 05:30.705
- I noticed he had blood
on the back of his head,

05:30.747 --> 05:35.627
a laceration, a gash,

05:35.669 --> 05:38.880
as if he had been struck
with great force.

05:38.922 --> 05:42.717
Is it possible, sir,
that after he made his remark,

05:42.759 --> 05:44.594
he turned to walk away,

05:44.636 --> 05:48.473
and you just swung

05:48.515 --> 05:50.308
and hit him in
the back of the head?

05:50.350 --> 05:52.686
- No, no.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.480
- Sometimes people snap,

05:55.522 --> 05:57.524
not because they're criminals,

05:57.565 --> 06:01.361
but in fact because
they're human.

06:01.403 --> 06:04.864
People can only take so much.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.409
I can't imagine the abasement

06:07.450 --> 06:09.869
of having to dress up
as a hot dog,

06:09.911 --> 06:13.540
to be ridiculed
by people on the street,

06:13.581 --> 06:16.960
losing your career,
your wife,

06:17.002 --> 06:21.631
seeing yourself in that costume
through your children's eyes.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.384
We can only take so much.

06:24.426 --> 06:27.303
I know you didn't mean
for this to happen, Mr. Hamlin,

06:27.345 --> 06:28.805
but it did happen.
- [sobbing]

06:28.847 --> 06:32.726
- And the best thing now
for you, your children,

06:32.767 --> 06:35.478
would be for you
to be forthcoming.

06:35.520 --> 06:42.027

06:44.988 --> 06:46.322
- [exhales]

06:46.364 --> 06:48.616
- Wow.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.702
Is he always that good?
- Always.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.537
- Just not usually that fast.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.080
It must be some kind of
damn record.

06:54.122 --> 06:57.500
- [laughs]
- Keeping him in the costume--

06:57.542 --> 06:59.794
it's almost not fair.

07:04.466 --> 07:05.300
- Hello.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.635
My name is Detective Avraham.

07:07.677 --> 07:11.222
- Nora Conte.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.475
This is my son, Vincent.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.101
He's missing.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.687
He didn't come home
from school today.

07:17.729 --> 07:22.192
He didn't call.
He's not picking up his phone,

07:22.233 --> 07:23.318
and it's almost 10:00.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.028
- How old is your son?

07:25.070 --> 07:26.946
- 16.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.114
- You're sure he was
at school today?

07:28.156 --> 07:29.783
- I spoke to his friend.
He was there.

07:29.824 --> 07:33.453
But school lets out at 3:30,
and he's missing.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.872
- Well, 16-year-old boys
can sometimes

07:35.914 --> 07:37.749
choose to be missing,

07:37.791 --> 07:39.501
often with 16-year-old girls.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.587
- He's not having sex
with a 16-year-old girl.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.964
He's--he's missing.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.217
[cell phone rings]

07:47.258 --> 07:50.470
I'm sorry.
Hello.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.597
No.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.642
I'm with the police now.

07:55.684 --> 07:58.144
Okay.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.605
My husband.
- Where is he?

08:00.647 --> 08:01.773
- Austin, Texas.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.025
He left this morning
for a business trip.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.735
- Is he also
convinced something

08:05.777 --> 08:07.153
has happened to Vincent?

08:07.195 --> 08:09.948
- Yes.

08:09.989 --> 08:14.452
Please. He's my heart.

08:16.746 --> 08:20.333
- Next week's class assignment,
I want it all in the narrative.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.168
Sense of place, no dialogue.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.004
And I beg you, please,
no more than three pages

08:24.045 --> 08:25.171
'cause I'm only human.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.673
And prose only, Julia.
No rhyming.

08:26.715 --> 08:27.924
I double beg you.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.635
Zack, hang back, would you?

08:36.099 --> 08:37.350
Sit a sec, will you?

08:37.392 --> 08:40.812
- Uh-oh,
being held after class.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.025
- I finished the manuscript.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.318
- Oh. And?

08:50.071 --> 08:53.241
Oh, I did that much, huh?
[chuckles]

08:53.283 --> 08:56.536
- This is a very difficult
thing for me to say.

08:56.578 --> 09:00.373
It'll be more so
for you to hear.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.375
I don't think you were
meant to be a writer,

09:02.417 --> 09:04.419
at least not a novelist.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.712
There are ways to make a living

09:05.754 --> 09:08.381
utilizing your
writing skills, but--

09:08.423 --> 09:11.092
- What does that mean?
I am a writer.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.345
- Fiction is not your calling.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.389
- That's not true.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.933
No, that's not true.

09:18.975 --> 09:22.729
Just because you didn't respond
to something doesn't--

09:22.771 --> 09:24.189
you're the one that said,

09:24.230 --> 09:26.149
"Don't let anyone tell you
you can't write."

09:26.191 --> 09:27.734
Those were your words.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.527
- Yes, they were.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.074
- Well, I'll get better.

09:34.115 --> 09:37.077
[distant siren wailing]

09:37.118 --> 09:39.454
That's all.
I'll just get better.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.039
- You'll remember
I made an admission early on

09:41.081 --> 09:44.417
that I did not think this craft
could really be taught.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.837
Plot, convention,
story structure, sure.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.422
But at the end of the day,

09:49.464 --> 09:51.758
either a person can write
or he cannot.

09:51.800 --> 09:55.428
You cannot.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.021
- How do you do that?

10:46.062 --> 10:48.273
- I'm sorry?

10:48.314 --> 10:52.819
- It's almost like
he wanted to confess.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.655
- Many do.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.658
People tend to be burdened
by their wrongdoing.

10:58.700 --> 11:03.538
- That's what you picked up on,
his burden?

11:05.832 --> 11:08.585
- What did you see?

11:08.626 --> 11:13.214
- I saw a man who had
been utterly reduced,

11:13.256 --> 11:15.216
and you valued him,

11:15.258 --> 11:17.594
but we all do that.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.387
We're all taught that trick.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.390
- Perhaps it
shouldn't be a trick.

11:24.017 --> 11:28.855
The Talmud teaches us
to see a single human being

11:28.897 --> 11:31.608
as the whole world,

11:31.649 --> 11:33.693
that each person is entitled

11:33.735 --> 11:38.198
to infinite
respect and concern.

11:38.239 --> 11:41.576
Everyone is precious.

11:41.618 --> 11:45.538
I believe that, Janine.

11:45.580 --> 11:48.458
Mr. Hamlin saw
and felt as much.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.297
This job...

11:54.339 --> 11:56.675
it would be easy
to lose faith in humanity.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.388
It would be a mistake.

12:19.989 --> 12:24.327
- Hey, I'm home.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.788
- I'm in the tub.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.932
- Wow.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.267
Look at you.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.936
- Living the life.
- Mm-hmm.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.105
- It took me over an hour
to put him down tonight,

12:52.147 --> 12:56.026
so I earned every last bubble.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.485
How was class?

12:57.527 --> 13:01.031
- Good. Good, yeah,
he, um--

13:01.072 --> 13:03.783
liked the book.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.953
- Oh, my God, that's fantastic.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.705
- Yep.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.915
- I am so proud of you.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.378
What's wrong?

13:15.420 --> 13:20.759
- Nothing.
I'm just looking at you.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.261
A man can still objectify
his wife, right?

13:23.303 --> 13:24.679

13:24.721 --> 13:27.557

there for a second.

It's actually nice
to be objectified.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.706
Let me get out of the tub.
- Mm.

13:51.748 --> 13:55.043
Have I ever told you
how much I love bubbles?

13:55.085 --> 13:58.380

Zackary.

13:58.421 --> 14:00.006

14:08.264 --> 14:10.225
- Mm!
- You okay?

14:10.266 --> 14:13.144
- Yeah, I just--maybe it makes
a little more sense to--

14:13.186 --> 14:15.355
[laughs]

14:15.397 --> 14:17.273
Oh.

14:17.315 --> 14:21.361
[moaning]
[water splashing]

14:21.403 --> 14:23.947
[dark music]

14:23.988 --> 14:26.908
[both grunting]

14:26.950 --> 14:30.412
* *

14:39.546 --> 14:42.674
[beep]
[printer whirs]

14:42.716 --> 14:45.385
- [exhales]
[door opens]

14:48.054 --> 14:49.806
[sighs]

14:49.848 --> 14:51.599
- I hear breathing.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.643
- I'd like to partner with Avi.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.064
- No.
- You want me to learn,

14:58.106 --> 14:59.858
so who better to teach me?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.860
- You can't learn what he does.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.446
- Yes, I can.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.448
Wouldn't it be great
to have two detectives

15:06.489 --> 15:08.575
with that skill set?

15:08.616 --> 15:10.660
- No.

15:13.371 --> 15:15.165
- Okay.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.211
Um, open or closed?

15:33.641 --> 15:36.603
[tense music]

15:36.644 --> 15:37.645
* *

15:37.687 --> 15:39.147
- Zack.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.819
- You're up.

15:46.696 --> 15:51.034
- Yeah, I got up to feed Luke.
You...

15:51.076 --> 15:53.244
didn't hear him crying?

15:55.705 --> 15:57.874
- I guess I didn't.
[chuckles softly]

15:57.916 --> 16:05.173
* *

16:05.465 --> 16:08.551
- What's going on?

16:08.593 --> 16:10.804
- What--what do you mean?

16:13.807 --> 16:17.686
- I'm a little freaked out
about what happened in the tub.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.438
- What?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.024
- Well, I asked
to get out of the tub,

16:23.066 --> 16:25.026
and then I slipped.

16:25.068 --> 16:28.154
Then you were on top of me

16:28.196 --> 16:30.073
in a nanosecond,
then inside me.

16:30.115 --> 16:32.909
And I'm not saying that
I wouldn't have consented,

16:32.951 --> 16:36.329
but there wasn't time.
- Wait, what are you saying?

16:36.371 --> 16:39.791
- It was a little aggressive
for my taste.

16:39.833 --> 16:44.087
- Aggressive?
We were making love.

16:44.129 --> 16:47.465
- You imposed yourself.

16:47.507 --> 16:51.052
- Are you serious?

16:51.094 --> 16:53.388
- I will not be fucked
like that, Zack.

17:01.312 --> 17:07.736
* *

17:07.777 --> 17:12.157
- [praying inaudibly]

17:19.664 --> 17:26.796
* *

17:29.174 --> 17:31.259
- I'm retired detective
Sgt. Wally Zeitz,

17:31.301 --> 17:33.136
and this is
"Breaking the Case,"

17:33.178 --> 17:35.096
a podcast series
written and produced

17:35.138 --> 17:36.931
by the New York City
Police Department.

17:36.973 --> 17:41.311
We're going to take you back
to a case from August 2006.

17:41.353 --> 17:43.730
This is the story
of how one individual

17:43.772 --> 17:46.941
terrorized the roadways
of Queens for seven hours.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.319
We'll hear from officers
who crisscrossed

17:49.361 --> 17:52.864
the highways that night on
the lookout for a green car.

17:52.906 --> 17:59.996
* *

18:09.798 --> 18:11.716
- You pour it so slowly.
- [scoffs]

18:11.758 --> 18:13.468
You got rituals,
I got rituals.

18:13.510 --> 18:16.137
I like to pretend
I'm in Europe somewhere,

18:16.179 --> 18:20.225
one of those cafés with
the French press thingies.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.477
Makes this shit taste better.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.604
My wife gave me an article
about attitude

18:24.646 --> 18:26.231
and outlook and whatnot.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.859
- Avi, I've decided to partner
you with Janine for a while.

18:29.901 --> 18:32.028
- Because?
- Well, because she asked,

18:32.070 --> 18:33.947
and the more I thought on it,
it makes sense.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.281
- I prefer to work alone.

18:35.323 --> 18:36.658
- Well, who was it
that said you don't

18:36.700 --> 18:38.159
always get what you want?

18:38.201 --> 18:41.162
- Janine's cool.
You might actually like her.

18:41.204 --> 18:43.498
- I won't intrude, promise.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.500
- You already have.

18:45.542 --> 18:49.921
- Well, the Talmud says
it's forbidden for a teacher

18:49.963 --> 18:51.256
to reject a student.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.467
So, I mean,
Halakahkly speaking,

18:54.509 --> 18:59.431
if I ask you,
you kind of have to teach me.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.391
- [laughs]

19:06.146 --> 19:09.149
[tense tone]

19:09.190 --> 19:15.780
* *

19:15.822 --> 19:17.574
- He's still missing.

19:24.414 --> 19:27.584
[tense music]

19:27.625 --> 19:34.549
* *

19:37.761 --> 19:39.304
- Hey, hey.

19:45.894 --> 19:48.188
Are you seeing this?

19:48.229 --> 19:50.440
- Vincent's missing.

19:50.482 --> 19:51.816
- What?
- Evidently,

19:51.858 --> 19:55.028
he didn't come home
from school yesterday.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.696
- Wait, are you serious?
- Yeah.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.448
A detective knocked
on the door.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.575
There were two.
They said they'd be back.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.410
- They knocked on our door?

20:02.452 --> 20:03.953
- Yeah, all the neighbors.

20:03.995 --> 20:11.169
* *

20:13.004 --> 20:15.006
[indistinct chatter]

20:15.048 --> 20:17.092
- The last time
I saw him was...

20:17.133 --> 20:19.135
- Excuse me, sir?

20:19.177 --> 20:20.512
Can I help you?

20:20.553 --> 20:23.390
- Um, yeah, sorry.
I'm one of the neighbors.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.266
I live on the floor below.
Zack Miller.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.476
I was told that the police

20:26.518 --> 20:27.519
wanted to speak
with me and my wife.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.812
Can you tell me what happened?

20:28.853 --> 20:31.231
- We'll be right down
after we finish up here.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.816
- Okay,
but is Vincent all right?

20:32.857 --> 20:35.276
- We'll be right down,
Mr. Miller.

20:36.778 --> 20:38.279
- Yeah, of course.

20:38.321 --> 20:39.989
- Okay.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.908
- We were arguing for...

20:46.579 --> 20:49.165
- Something bad's happened.
- Like what?

20:49.207 --> 20:51.793
- I don't know.
I was shooed away.

20:51.835 --> 20:53.128
I mean,
it's like a crime scene.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.838
- Oh, my God.
What do you suppose?

20:54.879 --> 20:56.339
[baby crying]

20:56.381 --> 20:58.842
- They were interviewing
a lady.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.353
- Mr. Miller?
- Yes, Zack.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.063
Please, come on in.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.774
This is my wife, Dania.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.860
- Yes.
I'm Detective Avraham.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.486
This is Detective Harris.

21:18.528 --> 21:19.863
Could we speak with
you both for a moment?

21:19.904 --> 21:21.906
- Yeah, of course.
- What's happened to Vincent?

21:21.948 --> 21:25.618
- We don't know.
We only know that he's missing.

21:25.660 --> 21:27.579
When did you last see Vincent?

21:27.620 --> 21:30.540
- Um, that would be Monday.

21:30.582 --> 21:32.792
I'm his tutor.
Or, I--I was his tutor.

21:32.834 --> 21:34.919
I would tutor Vincent
about twice a week.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.422
I was helping him with
his writing skills.

21:37.464 --> 21:40.383
- Zack's a writer.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.968
- You last saw him Monday?

21:42.010 --> 21:43.261
- In the evening, yes.

21:43.303 --> 21:44.721
We passed on the stairs.

21:44.763 --> 21:48.516
I was going down,
he was going up.

21:48.558 --> 21:51.394
- Did you notice anything
unusual about his behavior?

21:51.436 --> 21:54.439
- No, he seemed like normal,

21:54.481 --> 21:57.525
which was quiet, polite.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.903
- Yeah,
he's a lovely young man.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.946
- What about his family?

22:01.988 --> 22:03.198
- What do you mean?

22:03.239 --> 22:05.116
- Are they close-knit?

22:05.158 --> 22:07.869
- I have no reason
to think that they're not.

22:07.911 --> 22:09.496
- A few of the neighbors
said they heard fighting

22:09.537 --> 22:11.206
from upstairs on Monday night.

22:11.247 --> 22:14.084
- I heard something,
uh, yelling.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.878
I couldn't tell who it was,

22:16.920 --> 22:19.839
but it was definitely
an argument of some sort.

22:19.881 --> 22:22.133
- Were the voices
male or female?

22:22.175 --> 22:25.637
- I think it was--
they were both male voices.

22:25.679 --> 22:29.974
- Do you think he did something
to Vincent, the father?

22:30.016 --> 22:32.352
- I wasn't expecting
that question.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.523
Do you have reason
to believe the father

22:36.564 --> 22:38.316
did something to Vincent?
- No, no, no, no, no.

22:38.358 --> 22:42.904
He's just a mercurial man,
you know, a little aggressive.

22:49.160 --> 22:52.956
- Did Vincent ever talk to you
about his father?

22:52.997 --> 22:55.875
- Not much, no.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.003
- Did you and he ever
talk about things

22:58.044 --> 22:59.337
going on in his life?

22:59.379 --> 23:01.047
Sometimes students confide
in their tutors.

23:01.089 --> 23:04.926
- Nah, we mostly just
talked about his writing.

23:04.968 --> 23:08.596
- He never mentioned plans
to run away?

23:08.638 --> 23:13.351
Problems at school, maybe?

23:13.393 --> 23:16.021
- Uh, no.

23:24.112 --> 23:26.197
- Any suicidal ideation?

23:26.239 --> 23:27.824
- Suicide?

23:27.866 --> 23:30.660
- In his writings, maybe?
- No, no, never.

23:30.702 --> 23:32.662
- Is that what you think
happened?

23:32.704 --> 23:35.623
- We have no idea
what's happened to him.

23:35.665 --> 23:38.793
Quite possibly nothing at all.

23:41.713 --> 23:43.173
- Sorry, is--
is there a reason

23:43.214 --> 23:45.133
you're looking at me like that?

23:45.175 --> 23:47.761
- Like what?

23:47.802 --> 23:51.306
- Like I'm a suspect
or something.

23:51.348 --> 23:53.183
- People tell me
I do that sometimes.

23:53.224 --> 23:56.853
It's not my intent.

23:56.895 --> 23:58.396
- Yeah.

23:58.438 --> 24:00.148
- You were looking at him
kind of funny.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.441
- Funny how?

24:01.483 --> 24:03.526
- Well, your eyebrows
kinda bulge.

24:03.568 --> 24:07.489
Like, they bulge, like--
like that.

24:07.530 --> 24:10.075
- No, I don't do that.
- Yeah, you do.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.786
You're doing it right now,
and you did it to the tutor.

24:12.827 --> 24:14.537
And that's why he asked you

24:14.579 --> 24:16.331
why you were
looking at him funny.

24:16.373 --> 24:17.582
- I was looking at him
curious

24:17.624 --> 24:19.417
because he's withholding
something.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.378
- Okay.

24:21.419 --> 24:24.422
[eerie music]

24:24.464 --> 24:26.925
What are you looking at now?

24:30.428 --> 24:32.931
- Avi, you still out there?

24:32.972 --> 24:34.307
- Just leaving.

24:34.349 --> 24:37.477
- We've got a 10-10.
Shots fired at Art's Deli.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.479
- I know Art.

24:47.570 --> 24:50.657
[siren wailing]

24:53.576 --> 24:56.788
[tense music]

24:56.830 --> 24:58.832
- We've got eyes on them
through the security cameras.

24:58.873 --> 25:00.959
Looks to be about ten hostages.
We've called for a negotiator.

25:01.001 --> 25:02.460
[gunshot]

25:02.502 --> 25:03.795
- The ceiling again.

25:03.837 --> 25:05.547
He shot the roof twice
and the register once.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.132
- Is he making demands?

25:07.173 --> 25:08.508
- He's just screaming.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.344
Schizophrenia, drugs,
maybe both.

25:11.386 --> 25:12.762
He's a vet,
name is Kyle Henderson.

25:12.804 --> 25:13.847
That's about all we know.

25:13.888 --> 25:16.349
- Has anyone been hurt?
- Not yet.

25:16.391 --> 25:19.436
- He's got everyone
lying down now.

25:19.477 --> 25:21.730
- Janine.
- Yeah?

25:21.771 --> 25:24.399
- Stay here. Hold this.
- What?

25:24.441 --> 25:26.359
No, no, no.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.570
Avi!
- What's he doing?

25:28.611 --> 25:31.740
[siren wailing]

25:35.994 --> 25:38.204
- No more medicine,
no more hospitals.

25:38.246 --> 25:41.666
It didn't have to be this way!

25:41.708 --> 25:44.586
It's your fault! Your fault!
Stop moving!

25:44.627 --> 25:46.254
You made me do it.

25:46.296 --> 25:49.799
Stop moving!
[hostages crying]

25:49.841 --> 25:52.093
[laughing]

25:52.135 --> 25:53.720
I'm just following orders.

25:57.223 --> 26:00.018
[panting]

26:00.060 --> 26:01.353
- Hello.

26:01.394 --> 26:03.355
- What the hell?

26:03.396 --> 26:05.023
What the hell is this?

26:05.065 --> 26:06.358
- What's happening?

26:06.399 --> 26:08.026
- What's happening?
What's happening?

26:08.068 --> 26:09.986
What the fuck do you think
is happening?

26:10.028 --> 26:11.571
[woman screams]

26:14.616 --> 26:17.577
Don't look at me.

26:17.619 --> 26:21.790
You just walked into the
wrong place at the wrong time.

26:21.831 --> 26:25.377
- Please, sir.
- Please, sir?

26:25.418 --> 26:27.629
[cocks gun, fires]

26:31.007 --> 26:32.842
- Kyle.

26:32.884 --> 26:36.429
- How do you know my name?

26:36.471 --> 26:42.352
How do you know my name?

26:42.394 --> 26:43.353

[pained groans]

26:51.945 --> 26:54.906
[panting loudly]

26:54.948 --> 26:56.491
- You'll be okay.

26:56.533 --> 26:58.493
You'll be okay.

26:58.535 --> 27:01.746
- You're not
a hostage negotiator.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.665
- It didn't feel like
it could wait.

27:03.707 --> 27:05.750
- Yeah, it could wait, Avi.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.795
It could wait for
a hostage negotiator.

27:08.837 --> 27:10.588
- It didn't feel like
an option.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.632
- You are not here
to save humankind.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.426
I just need you
to solve crimes--

27:14.467 --> 27:15.885
who did what to whom and why.

27:15.927 --> 27:17.846
Those are the questions
that you tackle.

27:17.887 --> 27:21.558
For you to walk into
a hostage situation, for which

27:21.599 --> 27:24.853
you are not trained--
- I'm trained.

27:24.894 --> 27:27.439
I grew up in Crown Heights.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.858
- Seriously, Avi?

27:32.318 --> 27:35.113
[mouse clicking]

27:35.155 --> 27:38.074
- I mean, not to overstep...
- 'Cause you would never.

27:38.116 --> 27:40.869
- But it did strike me as
a little self-destructive.

27:40.910 --> 27:43.371
I mean, like, not just
saving other people's lives,

27:43.413 --> 27:44.914
but maybe risking your own.

27:44.956 --> 27:46.750
- You pretend
to be a psychologist.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.710
- Oh, what?
Like you don't.

27:48.752 --> 27:52.297
Avi, we are not trained
to disarm terrorists,

27:52.339 --> 27:54.799
unless maybe you are.

27:54.841 --> 27:57.969
Oh, my God, are you a spy?
CIA? Mossad?

27:58.011 --> 28:00.013
You can tell me.

28:03.224 --> 28:05.977
- You just made a face. Hm.

28:06.019 --> 28:08.605
It's not a superpower.
The screen reflects.

28:08.646 --> 28:10.106
There he is.

28:10.148 --> 28:12.984
- Who?
- His name is John Wentworth.

28:13.026 --> 28:14.819
He used to teach philosophy
at Rockefeller,

28:14.861 --> 28:17.447
and was discharged six years
ago for teaching Mark 9

28:17.489 --> 28:18.698
with a little too much vigor.

28:18.740 --> 28:19.949
He's homeless now.

28:19.991 --> 28:21.493
I saw him on the street
this morning,

28:21.534 --> 28:23.661
and video surveillance placed
him there yesterday morning.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.163
He walks that street a lot.

28:25.205 --> 28:27.290
He sees and he hears.
He might have some information.

28:27.332 --> 28:29.167
- Whoa, you really have
that eyebrow thing going on.

28:29.209 --> 28:31.544
- Did you feel anything in the
Conte house? Sense anything?

28:31.586 --> 28:34.047
Sometimes, places talk.
- Okay.

28:34.089 --> 28:38.093
- What did it feel like to you?

28:38.134 --> 28:39.678
- Not good.

28:39.719 --> 28:41.513
- I need to go back.

28:41.554 --> 28:42.931
- Right.

28:42.972 --> 28:47.143
[soft suspenseful music]

28:47.185 --> 28:50.063
- Who the fuck are you
to tell me I can't write?

28:52.023 --> 28:54.651
You are wrong.
- Zack--

28:54.693 --> 28:56.027
- That's what
I came to tell you.

28:56.069 --> 28:57.987
I came to tell you
you are so, so wrong.

28:58.029 --> 28:59.698
I can write.
I am a writer.

28:59.739 --> 29:01.199
You're the one
that's a realtor.

29:01.241 --> 29:03.159
- Have a seat.

29:05.745 --> 29:09.624
- I don't wanna sit.

29:09.666 --> 29:12.002
- Okay. Yes, I have a job.
- Mm-hmm.

29:12.043 --> 29:14.879
- I have a life, which helps me
to write with authenticity.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.881
Do you think it's a coincidence
that my best stories

29:16.923 --> 29:19.217
are about real estate?

29:19.259 --> 29:21.886
Look, maybe it's
the only world I know,

29:21.928 --> 29:23.304
but what's the world
you know, Zack?

29:23.346 --> 29:24.639
I have no idea.

29:24.681 --> 29:25.724
It certainly isn't evident
in your material.

29:25.765 --> 29:28.059
- It's the whole point
of class.

29:28.101 --> 29:30.061
You're the teacher.
Maybe that's your problem.

29:30.103 --> 29:32.063
Aren't you supposed
to be giving me something?

29:32.105 --> 29:33.398
- You need to dig
your guts out, Zack.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.775
It's why we all write
at the end of the day,

29:35.817 --> 29:37.694
to reveal ourselves,

29:37.736 --> 29:39.738
to be heard.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.948
Who are you?

29:41.990 --> 29:44.743
I have no fucking idea.

29:44.784 --> 29:47.746
[soft dramatic music]

29:47.787 --> 29:54.919
* *

29:59.883 --> 30:02.719
- I wonder if I might
see Vincent's room again?

30:10.810 --> 30:13.480
And you say
it's always this neat?

30:13.521 --> 30:17.359
- Yes. I think it gives him
a sense of calm and order.

30:17.400 --> 30:20.153
He can get anxiety sometimes.

30:24.783 --> 30:28.453
- No. I know this.

30:28.495 --> 30:30.246
The luggage.

30:30.288 --> 30:33.416
My mother gave me
this very set.

30:33.458 --> 30:36.753
In my youth, I had big plans
to travel the world.

30:44.844 --> 30:47.138
- That's Vincent's
class schedule.

30:47.180 --> 30:49.057
He laminated it.

30:49.099 --> 30:50.809
- Before he left
the house for school,

30:50.850 --> 30:53.103
did anything seem different?

30:53.144 --> 30:55.021
- No.

30:55.063 --> 30:56.523
It was like any other day.

30:56.564 --> 30:59.943
He ate his breakfast,
loaded up his backpack,

30:59.984 --> 31:02.362
and then he was out the door.

31:02.404 --> 31:03.780
But that's his old backpack.

31:03.822 --> 31:07.617
He actually just got
a new one, actually.

31:07.659 --> 31:09.994
Here. Yep.

31:10.036 --> 31:12.831
And that's the coat
he was wearing, too.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.040
- When was this?

31:14.082 --> 31:17.419
- Just a few weeks ago.

31:17.460 --> 31:20.797
But that's his backpack
and his coat.

31:22.549 --> 31:23.883
That's him.

31:23.925 --> 31:25.885
- I'm told that your husband
and Vincent argued

31:25.927 --> 31:27.721
Monday night.

31:27.762 --> 31:30.348
The neighbors heard.

31:30.390 --> 31:33.893
Certainly, you must have.

31:33.935 --> 31:36.771
- No, actually, I didn't.

31:36.813 --> 31:39.691
Leonard and I met
some friends for a drink,

31:39.733 --> 31:41.693
and he came home early.

31:41.735 --> 31:43.361
I returned an hour later.

31:43.403 --> 31:47.407
But if they did argue,
I can guess what it was about.

31:47.449 --> 31:49.242
- Tell me.

31:49.284 --> 31:53.455
- Well, just Vincent is
a disappointment to his father.

31:54.748 --> 31:56.374
- Because?

31:56.416 --> 32:00.003
- Because his father
is the way he is.

32:00.045 --> 32:04.382
As far as I'm concerned,
the wrong person went missing.

32:04.424 --> 32:07.260
- Would you mind if I just
sit here for a moment?

32:07.302 --> 32:09.763
- Yeah.

32:11.139 --> 32:15.769
I do that sometimes too,
when he's at school.

32:15.810 --> 32:18.563
He can be a stranger to us.
[chuckles]

32:18.605 --> 32:25.779
* *

32:29.157 --> 32:31.785
Are you a good detective?

32:31.826 --> 32:35.080
- It would depend on
who you talk to.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.290
- I'm talking to you.

32:39.167 --> 32:41.294
- I'm a very good detective.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.804
May I hold your hand?

32:50.845 --> 32:53.348
It can help me to feel him.

33:02.774 --> 33:05.985
[exhales]

33:11.658 --> 33:14.536
[phone buzzes]

33:14.577 --> 33:16.871
- Oh, my God,
that's Vincent's phone.

33:16.913 --> 33:19.749
Hello?
Hello?

33:19.791 --> 33:21.584
[sighs]
Sh...

33:21.626 --> 33:22.919
He must have left it.

33:22.961 --> 33:24.504
- Why would he leave the house
without his phone?

33:24.546 --> 33:26.131
- No, he wouldn't. He wouldn't.
- Do you know the password?

33:26.172 --> 33:27.716
- No, I don't.
He changed it.

33:27.757 --> 33:30.135
It used to be his birthday.
- I'll need to take it.

33:30.176 --> 33:31.803
This might explain why
he hasn't called.

33:31.845 --> 33:34.180
- No, he could've just
borrowed somebody else's phone.

33:34.222 --> 33:36.349
- It's possible your son
doesn't want to be found

33:36.391 --> 33:38.518
and he left his phone
to avoid cellular tracking.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.395
- No, look, I know
that it makes sense to you

33:40.437 --> 33:42.480
that he would run away,
but he would never do that.

33:42.522 --> 33:45.150
- Why not? What separates him
from other 16-year-old boys

33:45.191 --> 33:47.861
in an unhappy household?

33:47.902 --> 33:52.032
- This is not
an unhappy household.

33:53.867 --> 33:57.120
- It's very unhappy,
Mrs. Conte.

34:01.041 --> 34:04.502
If we're to find your son,

34:04.544 --> 34:07.172
you must never lie to me.

34:11.593 --> 34:15.513
Your son has been unhappy
for a long time.

34:22.937 --> 34:25.690
- You seriously held her hand?

34:25.732 --> 34:27.400
Is that even allowed?

34:27.442 --> 34:29.027
- You wanna learn
or you wanna critique me?

34:29.069 --> 34:30.612
- Okay, you can't just
touch people like that, Avi.

34:30.653 --> 34:32.947
- Why not?
- Uh, because you can't.

34:32.989 --> 34:35.450
- The human fingertip is
a profoundly perceptive organ.

34:35.492 --> 34:37.410
- Oh, my God.
Okay, so what did she do?

34:37.452 --> 34:39.245
- Who?
- The mother.

34:39.287 --> 34:44.125
The female human woman mother
whom you fingertipped?

34:44.167 --> 34:45.627
- This is why
I don't like partners.

34:45.669 --> 34:47.504
- No, mm-mm.
This is why you need a partner,

34:47.545 --> 34:50.298
so that they can follow you
around and say, "Don't touch."

34:50.340 --> 34:52.592
- Oh, so we'll make you
my female woman mother.

34:52.634 --> 34:55.303
- Oh, okay.
Did you learn anything,

34:55.345 --> 34:57.472
from the room or the luggage,

34:57.514 --> 35:00.308
or, I don't know,
your finger organs?

35:00.350 --> 35:02.477
I mean, I do realize that
you did not walk out of there

35:02.519 --> 35:04.437
empty-handed,
but I'm just wondering

35:04.479 --> 35:05.772
if you learned anything.

35:05.814 --> 35:09.109
- Not as much
as I'm learning now.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.610
- [sighs heavily]

35:10.652 --> 35:12.612
Do you have a girlfriend?

35:12.654 --> 35:14.614
I'm not hitting on you at all.

35:14.656 --> 35:16.449
I'm just trying
to gauge how far out

35:16.491 --> 35:17.784
you are on the loner spectrum.

35:17.826 --> 35:20.120
- Where do you think I am?
- Oh, I don't know.

35:20.161 --> 35:23.206
Halfway between
interesting and weird.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.252
You like that?

35:27.293 --> 35:28.336
- I like that.
- Hm.

35:28.378 --> 35:30.547
- I like candor.
- Hm.

35:30.588 --> 35:32.007
- But in small doses.

35:38.471 --> 35:40.932
[cabinet closes]

35:43.852 --> 35:46.646
- Wow, I see somebody's
feeling creative.

35:46.688 --> 35:48.481
- Finally.

35:48.523 --> 35:50.233
- What do you mean, finally?

35:54.404 --> 35:56.698
- I need to...

35:56.740 --> 35:59.200
I need to tell you something.

36:03.496 --> 36:06.416
I lied...

36:06.458 --> 36:08.168
about Michael Rosen
liking the book.

36:08.209 --> 36:10.295
He, uh...

36:10.337 --> 36:13.006
told me I can't write.

36:13.048 --> 36:15.592
- Excuse me?

36:15.633 --> 36:17.761
- That's what he said.

36:17.802 --> 36:21.931
- Well, he's wrong, Zack.

36:21.973 --> 36:23.975
He's wrong.
- Is he?

36:24.017 --> 36:25.185
I mean, I can't get an agent.

36:25.226 --> 36:27.937
I can't get even a sniff
from any publishers.

36:27.979 --> 36:29.689
I mean,

36:29.731 --> 36:31.941
who am I to think
I have anything to say?

36:31.983 --> 36:36.029
- Well, you do have
something to say.

36:36.071 --> 36:37.238
You have a voice.

36:37.280 --> 36:41.910
- I have been feeling
just such inadequacy

36:41.951 --> 36:43.703
as a writer, as a husband.

36:43.745 --> 36:46.414
I think that's why I...

36:46.456 --> 36:48.833
I think that's why I, like,
acted out in the tub.

36:48.875 --> 36:50.168
I mean, I was--

36:50.210 --> 36:54.214
I don't even know
what happened in there, I'm...

36:54.255 --> 36:56.299
[sighs]
- Honey.

36:56.341 --> 36:59.052
- I can't just work at a
bookstore the rest of my life.

36:59.094 --> 37:01.596
I don't wanna write articles
for "Popular Mechanics."

37:01.638 --> 37:04.432
- Zack, listen to me.
You can write.

37:04.474 --> 37:06.309
And I've heard
this song before.

37:06.351 --> 37:07.769
You know where?

37:07.811 --> 37:11.731
Stephen King right before
he sold "Carrie."

37:11.773 --> 37:13.566
- Right.
[chuckles]

37:13.608 --> 37:16.736
- Your day is coming,
I promise you.

37:18.363 --> 37:21.116
[melancholy music]

37:21.157 --> 37:28.081
* *

37:40.802 --> 37:43.513
- Hey, John.
- Detective.

37:43.555 --> 37:45.265
- Out a bit late, are we?

37:45.306 --> 37:47.851
- Am I? I live here.

37:47.892 --> 37:50.395
- Here, there, and everywhere.

37:50.437 --> 37:52.856
- To lead a better life.

37:52.897 --> 37:55.442
- But you need your love
to be here.

37:55.483 --> 37:59.195
- Look, I'm kind of busy.

37:59.237 --> 38:00.655
Can I help you?

38:00.697 --> 38:02.407
- What makes you think
I need your help?

38:02.449 --> 38:04.951
- Well, the boy who lives
in that building is missing.

38:04.993 --> 38:06.911
You wanna know
if I've seen him.

38:06.953 --> 38:09.914
- Have you?
- Many times.

38:09.956 --> 38:12.709
He's full of melancholy.

38:12.751 --> 38:14.294
- Have you spoken to him?

38:14.336 --> 38:15.628
- Never.

38:15.670 --> 38:18.173
- And yet you know he's sad.

38:18.214 --> 38:20.717
- I can spot them.

38:20.759 --> 38:22.927
When I was a professor,
it was simple.

38:22.969 --> 38:24.137
The lecture hall
used to be filled

38:24.179 --> 38:26.431
with bright eyes and idealism.

38:26.473 --> 38:29.017
It was easy to spot
the disenfranchised.

38:29.059 --> 38:32.979
- But out here is just
a sea of blank faces,

38:33.021 --> 38:37.192
people staring into their
gadgets or their black holes.

38:39.903 --> 38:42.781
- When you do that,

38:42.822 --> 38:45.450
it's called dysthymia.

38:45.492 --> 38:48.244
It's the feeling that
life's not enough.

38:48.286 --> 38:50.997
[phone buzzing]
Something's missing.

38:51.039 --> 38:53.500
You feel it,
and so does this boy.

38:53.541 --> 38:54.751
- This is Avi.

38:54.793 --> 38:56.294
Hey, did you see him
yesterday morning?

38:56.336 --> 38:58.046
- I did not.

38:58.088 --> 38:59.881
- I'll have to
talk to you again.

38:59.923 --> 39:01.800
I'm on my way.

39:02.467 --> 39:05.345
[indistinct chatter]

39:10.684 --> 39:13.520
- Is there a reason
I can't talk to Leonard Conte?

39:13.561 --> 39:15.146
He's the missing boy's father.

39:15.188 --> 39:17.482
- It's Avi's case.
- And it's mine now, too,

39:17.524 --> 39:19.150
and I'm here and he's not.

39:19.192 --> 39:21.319
- Janine, you say
you wanna learn from Avi.

39:21.361 --> 39:23.613
Well, his greatest skill
is his capacity

39:23.655 --> 39:25.573
and willingness to observe.

39:25.615 --> 39:27.534
- What's that saying?

39:27.575 --> 39:29.160
Leap and the net shall appear.

39:29.202 --> 39:31.329
- Yeah, and I'll tell you
when you can leap.

39:31.371 --> 39:33.415
Oh, Avi, interrogation C.

39:33.456 --> 39:35.250
He's been there
almost 20 minutes.

39:35.291 --> 39:36.960
- Okay.

39:41.506 --> 39:43.133
I'm very sorry for this.

39:43.174 --> 39:45.093
- Yeah, well,
you should be fuckin' sorry.

39:45.135 --> 39:47.053
Now, I noticed you got ears
and eyeballs in here.

39:47.095 --> 39:48.388
I can see the cameras,

39:48.430 --> 39:49.848
so I'm just gonna get this
out on the open.

39:49.889 --> 39:51.850
I am very displeased
with you people.

39:51.891 --> 39:53.560
But my wife came to you
yesterday

39:53.601 --> 39:55.228
and you sent her home.

39:55.270 --> 39:56.771
Now, I know the statistics
on missing children.

39:56.813 --> 39:59.524
The first 24 hours are crucial,
and you sent my wife home.

39:59.566 --> 40:01.234
That is a fuckin' disgrace.

40:01.276 --> 40:02.777
She told you something
had happened.

40:02.819 --> 40:05.822
She goddamn told you.
[scoffs]

40:05.864 --> 40:07.824
- Were you as convinced
as your wife

40:07.866 --> 40:09.409
yesterday that
something had happened?

40:09.451 --> 40:11.578
- Yeah, I was.

40:11.619 --> 40:14.247
- And yet, you didn't return
home from your business trip

40:14.289 --> 40:16.249
until tonight.

40:16.291 --> 40:18.418
- Ooh, fuck you.

40:18.460 --> 40:20.086
You imply that
a father isn't concerned

40:20.128 --> 40:21.212
about his missing son?

40:21.254 --> 40:22.589
That gets you a "Fuck you."

40:22.630 --> 40:24.174
- I apologize if I offended.

40:24.215 --> 40:26.092
- Well, he's tougher than
your average hot dog.

40:26.134 --> 40:27.427
- Mm-hmm.
- Now, I'll admit,

40:27.469 --> 40:29.220
I'm very confused by
your son's disappearance.

40:29.262 --> 40:31.431
Confusion can be
such an oppression.

40:31.473 --> 40:33.641
I can't imagine yours.

40:33.683 --> 40:35.352
- And we're off.
- Shh!

40:35.393 --> 40:38.313
- You argued with
your son Monday night.

40:38.355 --> 40:42.233
That perhaps gives you hope
that he simply ran away.

40:42.275 --> 40:45.028
It's a common reaction
to conflict.

40:45.070 --> 40:47.447
But it perhaps
fills you with guilt

40:47.489 --> 40:52.577
in that you caused
your only son to run away.

40:52.619 --> 40:54.162
What was the argument about?

40:54.204 --> 40:55.538
- Yeah, like a fuckin'
boa constrictor.

40:55.580 --> 40:57.499
- Shh! Shut up.
- Sorry.

40:58.375 --> 41:01.753
- [clears throat]

41:01.795 --> 41:05.799
We--we were arguing
about college.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.425
He wants to go to NYU.

41:07.467 --> 41:10.136
He was telling me about
all the cool shit they have--

41:10.178 --> 41:13.390
their student exchange program,
a chance to study abroad.

41:13.431 --> 41:16.559
Nora said you saw
his suitcases, right?

41:16.601 --> 41:18.186
That's Vincent.

41:18.228 --> 41:21.690
He wants a life
to match his luggage.

41:21.731 --> 41:25.068
Anyway, I asked him what
he would bring to the school

41:25.110 --> 41:26.569
because that's what
these universities,

41:26.611 --> 41:28.321
these admissions people
are looking for,

41:28.363 --> 41:30.281
what a person is gonna
contribute to the community.

41:30.323 --> 41:31.616
And he'd have
to answer for that.

41:31.658 --> 41:33.910
And so I asked him
what would he contribute?

41:33.952 --> 41:36.454
Because so far in high school,
he hasn't contributed squat.

41:36.496 --> 41:37.997
He doesn't play sports,
no chess club,

41:38.039 --> 41:38.998
no student council, nothing.

41:39.040 --> 41:41.209
This kid gives back nothing.

41:41.251 --> 41:43.628
And all the top colleges
were gonna take note of that.

41:43.670 --> 41:47.173
And I was pointing that out
to him constructively,

41:47.215 --> 41:49.843
and he told me to fuck off.

41:49.884 --> 41:54.389
- From what I know of your son,
that seems out of character.

41:54.431 --> 41:57.183
- [chuckles]
Yeah, exactly.

41:57.225 --> 41:59.436
- How did you react?

41:59.477 --> 42:01.980
- Loudly, angrily.

42:02.022 --> 42:05.191
- Like a human.

42:05.233 --> 42:07.318
- Look, my son is a very...

42:07.360 --> 42:10.864
[sighs]
Weak person, detective.

42:10.905 --> 42:12.449
I take no pleasure in that.

42:12.490 --> 42:16.286
And for him to have
said that to me,

42:16.327 --> 42:20.915
"fuck off," to his father,
that must come from hate.

42:20.957 --> 42:23.209
So, yeah,
maybe I am responsible

42:23.251 --> 42:24.544
for him running away,

42:24.586 --> 42:28.631
but this notion that
he's out there on his own--

42:28.673 --> 42:32.093
he is ill-equipped,

42:32.135 --> 42:34.220
that much I know.

42:43.188 --> 42:46.149
- No one's home.
- Oh--[snickers]

42:46.191 --> 42:49.569
Okay, um, he doesn't have
a criminal record,

42:49.611 --> 42:51.946
and the rest of the neighbors
describe him the same.

42:51.988 --> 42:54.157
He's just a bit of misanthrope.

42:55.742 --> 42:58.870
What's with the fish?

42:58.912 --> 43:00.413
- I don't know.

43:00.455 --> 43:02.916
I--I just--

43:02.957 --> 43:06.378
I like to draw them.

43:06.419 --> 43:08.421
- [laughs]

43:08.463 --> 43:10.048
Okay.

43:10.090 --> 43:11.675
- Um,

43:11.716 --> 43:15.929
why did you ask to partner?

43:15.970 --> 43:17.639
Why me?

43:17.681 --> 43:21.267
- I told you, I wanna learn.

43:21.309 --> 43:24.479
And I like missing person
cases.

43:24.521 --> 43:28.441
They were always my favorite
on "Law & Order."

43:28.483 --> 43:32.278
And yeah, I don't wanna
become a missing person,

43:32.320 --> 43:36.116
which, I guess,
everyone kind of is in a way--

43:36.157 --> 43:40.078
Vincent, the hot dog man,

43:40.120 --> 43:43.915
that vet you took out
in the grocery store,

43:43.957 --> 43:46.418
the father just now,

43:46.459 --> 43:49.963
and cops, especially cops.

43:50.005 --> 43:53.758
We deal with such depravity
and despair on a daily basis.

43:53.800 --> 43:56.761
And sometimes,
it feels like the only way

43:56.803 --> 44:02.392
that we can survive this job
is to wall off our emotions.

44:02.434 --> 44:08.023
But once we do that,
we go missing from ourselves.

44:08.064 --> 44:11.860
And that hasn't
happened to you.

44:11.901 --> 44:15.030
I don't want it
to happen to me.

44:15.071 --> 44:17.574
Yeah, so that's why you.

44:20.035 --> 44:22.495
[phone buzzing]

44:24.998 --> 44:27.042
- Detective Avraham.

44:28.626 --> 44:30.003
We gotta go.

44:30.045 --> 44:33.214
[dramatic music]

44:33.256 --> 44:40.138
* *

44:51.566 --> 44:53.860
- I caught his name
on the Amber Alert,

44:53.902 --> 44:56.279
so I called it in.

44:56.321 --> 44:59.240
[music intensifies]

44:59.282 --> 45:06.414
* *

45:29.437 --> 45:32.190
- We better call the parents.
