I feel like there should be an app
that analyzes your tum

00:07.192 --> 00:08.985
and tells you what you want to eat.

00:09.068 --> 00:11.779
Yeah, but...
if the app could do that,

00:11.863 --> 00:14.240
you're basically saying
it could read your mind.

Yeah, I guess.

But, dude, you think that's a good idea?

00:17.076 --> 00:18.870
I mean,
what if it gets in the wrong hands?

00:18.953 --> 00:19.996
It could do some malicious shit.

Thinking about the military,
some corporate espionage.

That's no help at all.

00:36.012 --> 00:37.347
"I'm good with whatever" basically means

Probably the chicken or the carnitas.

or, in my case, the Indian chorus.

10:40.032 --> 10:41.784
All right, well, thanks so much.
Enjoy the film.

10:42.493 --> 10:44.912
Wow, that Indian chorus joke
totally killed.

10:44.996 --> 10:45.830
Boom.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.372
What up, playboy?

10:48.207 --> 10:49.792
Dude, this is incredible.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.002
I just bumped into Morris Chestnut,

10:51.085 --> 10:52.377
and he told me
to get out of his fucking way.

10:52.461 --> 10:53.378
It was great.

10:53.462 --> 10:54.505
-Buddy!
-Yeah!

10:54.588 --> 10:56.423
Congratulations, man.

10:56.507 --> 10:58.134
I'm so proud of you.

10:58.217 --> 10:59.384
Listen, I got you a little present

10:59.468 --> 11:00.803
to help celebrate your big day.

11:00.886 --> 11:03.181
Whoa. This a copy of Us Weekly?

11:03.263 --> 11:05.016
Yeah, you're a Hollywood big shot now.

11:05.099 --> 11:06.767
You got to know what people
are saying about you.

11:06.851 --> 11:08.102
Whoa, I'm in this?

11:08.186 --> 11:10.021
No, but there's a great article

11:10.104 --> 11:13.398
about Hollywood's top ten ugliest calves.

11:13.482 --> 11:15.275
It'll make you feel a lot better
about your own.

11:15.359 --> 11:16.777
Thanks, bud.

11:16.861 --> 11:18.821
Man, this is a lot
of pomp and circumstance

11:18.904 --> 11:21.740
for an empty special effects movie
with cardboard characters and no plot.

11:21.824 --> 11:25.077
Hey, take off your theater critic hat
and put on your friend hat.

11:25.161 --> 11:27.246
All right, I'll make an exception
this one time for you.

11:27.329 --> 11:28.497
Oh, shit.

11:28.580 --> 11:30.208
They're giving out free popcorn.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.125
Really, Brian?

11:31.209 --> 11:32.793
Your friend's in his first role
in a big movie,

11:32.877 --> 11:35.087
and you're excited
about a free $4 thing of popcorn?

11:35.171 --> 11:36.714
I'm excited for both.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.632
Me, too. Let's go get some.

11:41.219 --> 11:43.470
-This is gonna be awesome.
-I can't wait!

11:43.554 --> 11:45.014
Oh, guys, hold on a second.

11:45.097 --> 11:46.473
I'm not feeling well.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.061
I think the sickening is happening!

11:51.937 --> 11:54.314
Let's do this, baby!

11:54.398 --> 11:56.734
-Whoo!
-Yeah! Come on!

12:02.948 --> 12:06.952
♪ ♪

12:07.036 --> 12:07.912
What the fuck?

12:07.995 --> 12:09.580
They cut me out of the movie entirely?

12:09.663 --> 12:10.831
It's so shitty.

12:10.915 --> 12:12.666
They could have told you
before the premiere.

12:12.750 --> 12:15.169
Why did they have you
do an interview with Billy Bush?

12:15.253 --> 12:16.628
Hey, Cap, what happened?

12:16.712 --> 12:18.547
Did we go to the wrong movie?
Where were you?

12:18.630 --> 12:20.216
They cut me out, buddy.

12:20.299 --> 12:21.341
Hug time.

12:23.052 --> 12:25.012
You can go tighter. You won't hurt Arnold.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.018
Dude, look on the bright side.

12:31.102 --> 12:32.561
At least you got paid pretty well.

12:32.644 --> 12:33.478
Not really.

12:33.562 --> 12:36.023
I was mainly doing this for the exposure.

12:36.107 --> 12:37.691
Oh, but you got great stuff for your reel,

12:37.775 --> 12:39.777
so that's great.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.987
No, I mean,
I don't have access to that footage.

12:42.071 --> 12:43.906
I don't even know how to get it.

12:43.989 --> 12:44.823
Oh, you know what?

12:44.907 --> 12:47.618
It'll still be on your IMDb page, so...

12:47.701 --> 12:50.412
Mm, I don't think it will,
because I didn't appear in the movie.

12:51.413 --> 12:54.083
Okay, I'm officially out
of silver linings, dude.

12:54.166 --> 12:55.251
Sorry, man.

12:56.961 --> 12:58.087
Where's Ma?

12:58.170 --> 12:59.838
She got sick.

12:59.922 --> 13:01.257
The movie is called Sickening.

13:01.340 --> 13:03.717
She really got sick and went home.

13:04.843 --> 13:06.678
All right, well,
she didn't miss anything, anyway.

13:06.762 --> 13:07.888
I was cut out of the movie.

13:07.972 --> 13:09.098
It's okay.

13:09.181 --> 13:12.143
You can always do
another Go-Gurt commercial.

13:12.226 --> 13:13.144
It was good.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.354
Yeah, but that was, like, five years ago.

13:15.437 --> 13:18.565
If acting is your passion,
you should focus.

13:18.649 --> 13:21.568
"Passion" may be a bit strong of a word.

13:21.652 --> 13:23.654
So why don't you become a lawyer?

13:23.737 --> 13:25.323
What? No, I'm not gonna become a lawyer.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.991
So what do you want to do?

13:27.866 --> 13:28.700
I don't know.

13:31.287 --> 13:32.621
It's emergency room.

13:33.998 --> 13:36.041
Hey, John. What's up?

13:36.834 --> 13:38.418
You're kidding.

13:38.502 --> 13:40.254
Cucumber? Where?

13:40.338 --> 13:41.421
The butthole?

13:41.505 --> 13:42.673
Oh, my goodness.

13:42.756 --> 13:44.967
I'll be there.

13:45.050 --> 13:46.593
What's going on?

13:46.677 --> 13:48.637
Somebody got a cucumber in the butthole.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.514
I have to go and take it out.

13:50.597 --> 13:51.515
Bye.

13:53.642 --> 13:55.519
Do you want to do another shot?

13:55.602 --> 13:57.980
No, I'll just feel like garbage tomorrow.

14:00.191 --> 14:02.609
Oh, shit, there's Todd, the director.

14:03.986 --> 14:05.321
Have you talked to him yet?

14:05.404 --> 14:06.238
No.

14:06.322 --> 14:08.157
Maybe I should go over there
and have an awkward conversation

14:08.240 --> 14:09.741
and try to figure out
what the hell happened.

14:09.825 --> 14:10.701
Yeah.

14:10.784 --> 14:14.496
You know, he should have the decency
to tell you why he cut you out.

14:16.415 --> 14:17.833
Hey, man.

14:17.916 --> 14:19.418
Hey, what's up?

14:19.501 --> 14:22.421
Uh, so Dr. Vincent
didn't make the cut, huh?

14:22.504 --> 14:23.797
Yeah, I'm sorry, buddy.

14:23.881 --> 14:26.425
You were great,
but we had to lose some stuff.

14:26.508 --> 14:27.343
You know, it just kind of sucks,

14:27.426 --> 14:29.928
because I invited
a lot of my friends and family.

14:30.012 --> 14:31.596
Couldn't you have maybe told me before?

14:32.764 --> 14:35.309
I could have, but I didn't.

14:36.060 --> 14:38.020
Is that all you have to say for yourself?

14:38.103 --> 14:40.064
You're being such a douche.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.149
-All right, all right.
-Okay, why did you cut him out?

14:42.233 --> 14:44.068
Hey, you know, calm down.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.986
People get cut out of things all the time.

14:46.070 --> 14:47.946
Dev's not the first actor
to get cut from a movie.

14:48.030 --> 14:48.947
Oh.

14:49.031 --> 14:51.450
You know what,
I'm actually glad that he got cut out,

14:51.533 --> 14:54.661
because your movie was garbage.

14:54.745 --> 14:55.579
Hey, come on.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.373
Hey, actually, by the way,

14:57.456 --> 15:00.084
it was a piece of shit, the movie.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.919
- Calm down.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.421
It was fucking shit.

15:03.503 --> 15:04.338
God damn it.

15:04.422 --> 15:06.131
Well, you're charming.
It was nice meeting you.

15:06.215 --> 15:09.551
Enjoy the open bar,
which I think you already have.

15:09.634 --> 15:12.804
I'm gonna go hug Dulé Hill,
because he's nice,

15:12.888 --> 15:14.348
not like you guys.

15:16.141 --> 15:18.436
-What the fuck?
-What?

15:21.730 --> 15:23.232
Mmm.

15:23.315 --> 15:25.901
I can't believe you made this.

15:25.984 --> 15:27.986
See, I knew you'd be a good chef.

15:30.322 --> 15:31.823
Hey.

15:31.907 --> 15:32.908
What's up?

15:32.991 --> 15:34.952
Nothing.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.161
Really? You sure?

15:36.245 --> 15:38.247
Feels like you're not really
in the room right now.

15:38.330 --> 15:39.331
You're just...

15:40.832 --> 15:43.168
Well, how do you want me to eat pasta,
like this?

15:45.212 --> 15:47.881
No, I just--
I just want you to be engaged

15:47.965 --> 15:49.091
and listen when I talk to you.

15:49.174 --> 15:51.510
Well, maybe I'm just recovering

15:51.593 --> 15:54.554
from that horrible disaster of a night
I just had.

15:54.638 --> 15:56.014
You remember earlier?

15:56.098 --> 15:58.809
I went to the movie premiere
for this movie that I worked on forever,

15:58.892 --> 16:00.352
and I got cut out completely?

16:00.436 --> 16:03.481
And then you decided
to drunkenly berate the director?

16:03.563 --> 16:05.983
Okay, I'm sorry.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.319
It was coming from a good place.

16:08.402 --> 16:09.653
I'm sorry you got cut out.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.238
It's fine.

16:14.450 --> 16:17.119
But even before that,
you've been a little quiet lately.

16:17.202 --> 16:19.455
Is everything okay?

16:19.538 --> 16:20.747
All right.

16:20.831 --> 16:22.291
If you want to get into it, we can.

16:22.374 --> 16:24.668
I'll be honest with you, but, you know,

16:24.751 --> 16:27.505
promise not to get mad at me,
and we can have a conversation.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.673
I promise. Please be honest with me.

16:34.970 --> 16:36.054
I got really freaked out

16:36.138 --> 16:39.558
when we were
at Larry and Andrea's wedding.

16:39.641 --> 16:43.270
Just hearing the vows
and thinking about marriage

16:43.354 --> 16:48.025
and all that stuff, it just--
It just freaked me out.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.860
-Why?
-I don't know.

16:49.943 --> 16:53.905
I feel like when you're younger,
in your 20s,

16:53.989 --> 16:56.783
the road ahead in your life,
it's not as clear.

16:56.867 --> 16:58.536
You don't know where it's going.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.786
There's turns you don't expect.

16:59.870 --> 17:00.954
There's surprises.

17:01.038 --> 17:02.956
And then as you get older,

17:03.040 --> 17:04.916
the road just becomes
a little bit clearer,

17:05.000 --> 17:06.668
and you just know where you're gonna go,

17:06.751 --> 17:08.462
and there's less surprise
and less excitement,

17:08.546 --> 17:10.464
and you see what's ahead.

17:10.548 --> 17:11.590
So what are you saying?

17:11.673 --> 17:14.051
That our relationship
isn't exciting enough?

17:14.134 --> 17:16.636
No, I'm just saying,

17:16.720 --> 17:18.847
at this age, it's really intense.

17:18.930 --> 17:20.558
Whatever you're doing in your life,

17:20.640 --> 17:23.810
whoever you're with,
that's maybe it, you know?

17:23.894 --> 17:26.646
And it's a lot of pressure.

17:26.730 --> 17:28.148
Okay, I get that.

17:28.232 --> 17:29.983
But are you saying that you're not sure

17:30.067 --> 17:31.943
you want to be with me?

17:32.027 --> 17:33.487
No, I'm not saying that.

17:33.571 --> 17:35.322
Because it sounds like
that's what you're saying.

17:35.406 --> 17:37.241
It sounds like you're not sure
you want to be with me

17:37.324 --> 17:39.159
and that you don't like the road

17:39.243 --> 17:43.747
and you don't fucking want to do this
or something.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.417
No, but even if I wasn't sure,

17:46.500 --> 17:47.918
does that make me a horrible person?

17:48.001 --> 17:50.087
Or what, are you, like,
100% sure about everything?

17:50.170 --> 17:51.922
You have no doubts, no fears?

17:52.005 --> 17:54.132
No, I'm not 100% sure.

17:54.216 --> 17:55.926
Well, what percentage sure are you?

17:58.262 --> 18:00.722
Hey, why don't we just--
Why don't we just write it down?

18:00.805 --> 18:02.682
It'll be an interesting experiment.

18:02.766 --> 18:05.185
Really? You want to write it down?

18:05.269 --> 18:07.438
The percentage I think
we're gonna be together?

18:07.521 --> 18:08.480
That's a horrible idea.

18:08.564 --> 18:10.524
Why don't we just have a conversation?

18:10.608 --> 18:12.568
Because I tried to have a conversation,

18:12.651 --> 18:14.653
and you just started getting mad at me.

18:14.736 --> 18:16.988
Okay, fine, yeah, let's write it down.

18:30.586 --> 18:31.878
Eighty?

18:32.837 --> 18:33.838
Seventy?

18:33.922 --> 18:35.882
What? Seventy is a high number.

18:35.966 --> 18:38.218
It's not as high as 80,
the number I wrote.

18:38.302 --> 18:39.386
And I love that you wrote that down,

18:39.470 --> 18:41.763
but 70 is just as high.

18:41.846 --> 18:44.224
No, if there's a movie on Rotten Tomatoes
and it has a 70%,

18:44.308 --> 18:47.686
people say it has mixed reviews,
and I definitely don't go see it.

18:47.769 --> 18:49.896
So you're saying that
if our relationship was a movie,

18:49.980 --> 18:51.064
you wouldn't go see it.

18:51.148 --> 18:52.316
I was being conservative.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.568
I didn't want to go super high
and you go low.

18:54.652 --> 18:55.653
What does it even matter?

18:55.735 --> 18:57.571
Shouldn't we have both written 100
right away

18:57.655 --> 18:59.323
without even thinking about it?

18:59.406 --> 19:01.283
Larry and Andrea were at 100. That exists.

19:01.366 --> 19:03.661
If we're not at 100,
we're writing fucking 70 and 80,

19:03.743 --> 19:05.245
why are we even doing this?

19:05.329 --> 19:08.999
Well, seems like you've really done
the math on our relationship.

19:12.210 --> 19:13.462
You know what?

19:13.545 --> 19:15.714
I think I should go stay at Melinda's
for a little bit.

19:15.797 --> 19:17.716
Oh, wait, so now you're just leaving?

19:17.799 --> 19:19.134
You're leaving the apartment?

19:19.217 --> 19:20.719
Yeah, because I'm 100% sure

19:20.802 --> 19:22.220
I don't want to be around you right now.

19:24.723 --> 19:25.765
Oh, my God, Cap.

19:25.849 --> 19:26.975
That game sounds horrible.

19:27.058 --> 19:28.393
Why would you do that?

19:28.477 --> 19:29.394
I don't know.

19:29.478 --> 19:31.313
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

19:31.396 --> 19:33.857
I was actually psyched
when I thought of it.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.485
I may have to steal that
for a breakup move.

19:36.568 --> 19:39.237
Definitely got Rachel pissed very quickly.

19:39.321 --> 19:41.740
So are you guys really broken up?

19:41.823 --> 19:43.659
I'm not sure. It was left kind of vague.

19:43.742 --> 19:45.744
She's just staying at her friend's place
for a few days.

19:45.827 --> 19:47.787
Yeah, I mean,
at the heart of what you were trying to do

19:47.871 --> 19:49.247
with that game is not wrong.

19:49.331 --> 19:50.749
I mean, you're not 22.

19:50.832 --> 19:52.917
If you're gonna be in a relationship,
you got to dive in.

19:53.001 --> 19:56.338
You don't want to be messing around,
so maybe it's good it came up now.

19:57.673 --> 19:58.632
Maybe.

19:58.716 --> 19:59.966
Hopefully, we just need a couple of days,

20:00.050 --> 20:01.760
and we can sort it all out.

20:01.843 --> 20:04.596
When you close your eyes,
do you see Dev and Rachel

20:04.680 --> 20:07.599
in a cozy house
with little Devs running around,

20:07.683 --> 20:11.562
or do you see Dev out on the town
with brand-new ladies?

20:14.231 --> 20:15.857
I just see black.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.067
Oh, God.

20:17.150 --> 20:18.360
End of days.

20:21.613 --> 20:24.241
"I saw life branching out before me,

20:24.324 --> 20:27.035
like the green fig tree in the story.

20:28.662 --> 20:32.165
From the tip of every branch,
like a fat purple fig,

20:32.249 --> 20:34.710
a wonderful future beckoned and winked.

20:36.587 --> 20:41.174
One fig was a husband
and a happy home and children,

20:41.258 --> 20:43.802
and another fig was a famous poet,

20:43.885 --> 20:47.889
and another fig was a brilliant professor,

20:47.972 --> 20:52.977
and another fig was Europe
and Africa and South America,

20:53.061 --> 20:57.107
and another fig was Constantine
and Socrates and Attila

20:57.190 --> 20:58.483
and a pack of other lovers

20:58.567 --> 21:02.320
with queer names and offbeat professions,

21:02.404 --> 21:04.656
and beyond and above these figs

21:04.740 --> 21:07.826
were many more figs
I couldn't quite make out.

21:09.077 --> 21:12.205
I saw myself sitting
in the crotch of this fig tree,

21:12.289 --> 21:13.915
starving to death,

21:13.998 --> 21:15.917
just because I couldn't make up my mind

21:16.000 --> 21:18.462
which of the figs I would choose.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.464
I wanted each and every one of them,

21:20.547 --> 21:23.467
but choosing one
meant losing all the rest,

21:23.550 --> 21:26.637
and as I sat there, unable to decide,

21:26.720 --> 21:29.765
the figs began to wrinkle and go black.

21:29.848 --> 21:30.890
One by one,

21:30.974 --> 21:34.144
they plopped to the ground at my feet."

21:48.074 --> 21:48.908
Hey.

21:48.992 --> 21:50.828
Hey, how are you?

21:50.910 --> 21:53.955
Could we meet up and talk?

21:54.038 --> 21:56.834
Yeah, I think we should.

22:01.713 --> 22:02.756
Hey.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.424
Hey.

22:04.508 --> 22:05.801
Your hair's red.

22:06.593 --> 22:10.096
Dev, I'm moving to Tokyo.

22:10.180 --> 22:12.307
What?

22:12.390 --> 22:15.185
Why are you doing this?

22:15.268 --> 22:17.562
I thought things were going fine,

22:17.646 --> 22:20.064
and then I started to think
about what you said

22:20.148 --> 22:22.066
about how we're on this path,

22:22.150 --> 22:24.486
and you're kind of right.

22:24.569 --> 22:25.821
And then I thought about my sister

22:25.904 --> 22:27.781
and how she always wanted
to live in Paris,

22:27.865 --> 22:29.533
and now she's never going to.

22:29.616 --> 22:33.161
And if I don't do this now,
I don't think I ever will.

22:33.244 --> 22:35.246
Have you really thought this through?

22:35.330 --> 22:37.207
What are you gonna do for work?

22:37.290 --> 22:39.083
You don't speak Japanese or anything.

22:39.167 --> 22:41.252
I don't know. I'll figure something out.

22:41.336 --> 22:45.215
Look, I love you, but I want to do this.

22:45.298 --> 22:46.508
This is important to me.

22:46.591 --> 22:48.051
I don't want to wake up one day
and wonder,

22:48.134 --> 22:50.428
"What would it have been like
if I went to Japan?"

22:52.013 --> 22:53.682
I always play it safe,

22:53.765 --> 22:56.309
and I can't do it anymore.

22:56.393 --> 22:59.187
The time in our life to do crazy shit
is winding down,

22:59.270 --> 23:01.565
and I don't want to wake up one day

23:01.648 --> 23:05.652
and see that the window is already closed.

23:05.736 --> 23:07.237
I'm sorry.

23:08.279 --> 23:10.407
Really, really sorry.

23:15.203 --> 23:18.081
Dude, I can't believe they cut both of us
out of the movie entirely.

23:18.164 --> 23:21.334
Yeah.
That happened to me on The Cookout 3.

23:21.418 --> 23:23.378
The whole subplot of me beating Marquise

23:23.461 --> 23:25.630
at the pie-eating contest got scrapped.

23:27.131 --> 23:28.299
So how you doing?

23:29.342 --> 23:32.262
Well, in addition to that whole mess,

23:32.345 --> 23:34.055
my lady kind of left me.

23:34.138 --> 23:36.224
-She moved to Japan.
-Wow.

23:36.307 --> 23:39.018
She got as far away
from you as possible.

23:39.102 --> 23:40.144
Yeah.

23:41.354 --> 23:43.857
That-- That sucks.

23:44.858 --> 23:47.151
I did this thing where I had each of us

23:47.235 --> 23:48.904
write down what percent out of 100

23:48.987 --> 23:52.783
we thought that we'd be the last people
we'd be together with.

23:52.866 --> 23:53.992
Did not go well.

23:54.075 --> 23:55.285
No, it wouldn't.

23:55.368 --> 23:56.327
That's a horrendous idea.

23:56.411 --> 23:57.537
Why would you do that?

23:57.621 --> 23:58.580
I don't know.

23:58.663 --> 24:01.750
That's so, so ill-advised.

24:01.833 --> 24:03.084
Really stupid.

24:06.421 --> 24:07.589
What did she write?

24:07.672 --> 24:09.215
Seventy.

24:09.299 --> 24:10.884
Seventy is not bad.

24:10.968 --> 24:12.594
Seventy is not good.

24:12.677 --> 24:14.471
That's a C-minus. It's horrible.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.514
A 20 or a 30, that's bad.

24:16.598 --> 24:18.057
Seventy is decent.

24:18.141 --> 24:20.310
It's like... you passed.

24:20.393 --> 24:22.228
Shouldn't you be at 100, though?

24:22.312 --> 24:25.064
I went to this friend's wedding,

24:25.148 --> 24:26.691
and they did their vows,

24:26.775 --> 24:28.026
and it was incredible, you know?

24:28.109 --> 24:31.947
And I know, like,
vows are super romantic or whatever,

24:32.030 --> 24:35.867
but still, it...
It seemed like they were at 100.

24:35.951 --> 24:38.202
That's a nice story, but nobody is at 100.

24:38.286 --> 24:41.706
I mean, I'm in a great marriage,
and sometimes we're at 90.

24:41.790 --> 24:44.626
Other times, we're at, like, 20 or 30.

24:44.709 --> 24:45.543
It goes up and down.

24:45.627 --> 24:47.796
It's not just, like,
one number all the time.

24:47.879 --> 24:49.589
Oh, my God.

24:49.673 --> 24:52.009
Are you the dude
from the Mucinex commercial?

24:52.091 --> 24:53.426
Yeah, that's me.

24:53.510 --> 24:54.803
Oh, no shit.

24:54.886 --> 24:56.095
Dude, oh, my God.

24:56.179 --> 24:57.639
You were the booger.

24:57.722 --> 24:58.849
Oh, no, not Mucinex!

24:58.932 --> 25:00.183
Oh!

25:00.266 --> 25:01.726
This is amazing, man.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.521
All right, well, I'm with my friend, so...

25:04.604 --> 25:05.438
Oh, awesome.

25:05.522 --> 25:06.731
Yeah, all right, dude.

25:11.653 --> 25:13.905
He just took a picture of me
without asking.

25:13.989 --> 25:15.406
That was rude.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.285
Again, man, sorry about the girlfriend.

25:19.369 --> 25:20.704
That sucks.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.288
Yeah, it's tough, man.

25:22.372 --> 25:23.498
I don't know what to do.

25:23.581 --> 25:25.249
Long-term relationships are tough.

25:26.209 --> 25:28.962
You can't just expect
a big roaring fire right away,

25:29.046 --> 25:30.047
right, you know?

25:30.129 --> 25:32.590
You can't put the big logs in first.

25:32.674 --> 25:34.634
You got to start with the small stuff,

25:34.718 --> 25:36.260
the kindling, right?

25:36.344 --> 25:39.639
And you add that,
then you put in the big logs,

25:39.723 --> 25:41.933
and then you have a roaring fire,

25:42.017 --> 25:45.269
and that's a good relationship, right?

25:45.353 --> 25:47.522
But be careful.

25:47.605 --> 25:49.858
Sometimes kindling wood is hard to find,

25:49.941 --> 25:51.693
you know, good wood,

25:51.776 --> 25:54.905
so don't take it for granted.
