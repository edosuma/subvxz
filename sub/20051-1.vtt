02:59.763 --> 03:00.970
This is Dr. Miranda North,

03:01.056 --> 03:04.140
quarantine officer on board
the International Space Station.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.682
Today the Pilgrim capsule,
with its valuable Mars soil samples,

03:08.772 --> 03:11.685
completes its eight-month return from Mars.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.604
Preparing to receive these samples

03:14.695 --> 03:17.938
has been the purpose of our mission
these last few months.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.358
But the Pilgrim capsule is damaged.

03:22.244 --> 03:27.330
At 0630 UTC, Pilgrim was struck by debris
and veered off course.

03:27.958 --> 03:30.701
Rory Adams will spacewalk
to establish visual contact

03:30.794 --> 03:34.454
with the incoming space capsule,
and he will grab it with a remote arm.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.087
We've been waiting a long time
for this sample,

03:40.262 --> 03:43.471
and Rory is placing himself at great risk
to secure it.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.547
Over and out.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.803
EMU at 4. 7 psi, pure O2.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.306
Is that how you're gonna do it?
I wouldn't do it that way.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.137
- Dr. Jordan, status?
- Come on, faster, faster, faster.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.642
Nitrogen at near zero.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.099
- Dr. North?
- I'm in the airlock.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.649
Faster, faster, faster. Come on.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.352
Rory, slow to go fast.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.153
- Or fast to go fast.
- Deliberate.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.275
What does she have against fast?

04:00.365 --> 04:02.231
Remember, eight billion people.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.486
Rory, if you can't save it...

04:03.577 --> 04:05.534
Yeah, spoiler alert. I'm fucking saving it.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.704
But if you can't, Rory,
just push the capsule into deep space, okay?

04:08.790 --> 04:10.702
- Do you hear me?
- Can you get OCD...

04:10.792 --> 04:12.579
Sorry, CDC out of my face?

04:12.669 --> 04:14.581
'Cause I got a big operation.
I need to concentrate.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.207
- I just want you...
- I can't... I can't hear you...

04:16.298 --> 04:17.539
- I love you, too.
- ...at all.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.248
EMU at 4.7 psi, pure O2.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.673
Where's the remote?

04:20.761 --> 04:22.377
- Here. The arm's yours.
- There you go.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.928
- Full manual.
- All right, he knows. Let's go.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.721
Careful with... Sorry, you know this.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.218
Yeah, yeah. No more sorries.

04:27.309 --> 04:29.767
- Miranda, to the Cupola, please.
- All right, that's it.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.264
Yep.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.420
David? Are you on your way?

05:01.510 --> 05:02.921
On my way.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.923
- Slow, Sho.
- Excuse me.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.504
How do you say "breathe" in Japanese?

05:07.724 --> 05:09.465
This was supposed to be routine.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.766
The airlock is sealed.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.139
I am walking.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.391
4:35 UTC.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.444
After striking debris,
Pilgrim non-responsive.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.897
Inbound on collision course with ISS.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.700
Initiating emergency course correction
and manual retrieval.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.652
Canadarm online.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.658
Transferring control to wireless.

05:31.748 --> 05:32.989
Station to Control.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.120
- Initiating sequence.
- Affirmative.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.166
So, the committee?

05:36.253 --> 05:38.370
You let me worry about the committee.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.704
Where's Rory?

05:40.465 --> 05:41.831
He is at risk out there.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.791
Easy, folks. Mics are live.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.419
You ready, Sho?

05:46.513 --> 05:47.629
Thrusters up.

05:52.227 --> 05:53.684
Moving into position.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.970
I have control of the arm.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.975
Your worry lines are showing.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.849
Yeah, well, I get paid by the line.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.146
- I have a good feeling about this.
- Yeah?

06:44.654 --> 06:46.236
Rory's gonna deliver that sample.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.609
Right to your lab.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.576
Prepare for course correction.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.453
.050-niner by.076.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.704
- Remember your training.
- We never trained for this.

06:59.794 --> 07:04.084
On my mark. Five, four, three, two, one.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.472
New capsule trajectory, negative 0.50.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.179
Proximity alert. Proximity alert.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.764
Ignore the proximity alert.

07:22.484 --> 07:25.568
New station trajectory, negative.32.

07:25.654 --> 07:28.271
The capsule will miss us. Just.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.357
- Rory?
- I'm still downrange.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.526
And it's coming in shallow.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.242
Any moment now. Eight, maybe nine o'clock.

07:37.832 --> 07:38.788
I'm having fun.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.709
- Are you guys having fun?
- Rory, if you miss...

07:41.795 --> 07:43.081
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.252
If...

07:44.339 --> 07:48.083
Just gonna skip off the atmosphere
like a flat stone on water.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.586
Just fly off into nowhere. It's no harm done.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.217
Okay.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.136
There.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.183
- There.
- I see it.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.139
All right, here we go,
here we go, here we go.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.391
This is fun.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.894
Rory, you have to move. It's gonna hit you.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.067
- No, it's not.
- Please, Rory, move.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.398
Station to Control.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.821
Visual confirmation of Mars Capsule Pilgrim.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.194
I used to play catcher, but only in tee-ball.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.866
- Rory?
- Not now.

08:15.370 --> 08:18.745
Not now. No, come on, come here,
come here, come on, come on, come on.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.161
Rory?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.251
- Rory?
- Rory?

08:30.260 --> 08:31.922
- He got it.
- Yes!

08:35.765 --> 08:37.097
Hugh?

08:37.183 --> 08:38.719
Cue Instagram!

08:39.352 --> 08:40.592
I didn't want to jinx it.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.729
Point and shoot, motherfucker!

08:43.815 --> 08:45.351
Okay, okay.

08:58.747 --> 09:01.785
Mars Capsule in locked position.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.962
I'm coming home.

09:11.468 --> 09:14.131
This is Mission Commander
Ekaterina Golovkina.

09:14.763 --> 09:18.222
Tell the committee
Pilgrim's landed on Plymouth Rock.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.558
The Mars samples are safe and sound.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.226
Copy that, Commander.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.849
Congratulations.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.349
Ready?

10:07.565 --> 10:08.726
We are recording.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.062
0640 UTC.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.114
Pilgrim wasn't just seeing things
in Mars' soil.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.530
We're looking at a large single cell.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.827
Inert.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.700
Unmistakably biological.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.452
And, like organisms on Earth,

10:25.834 --> 10:29.498
has what appears to be
a nucleus, cytoplasm...

10:31.297 --> 10:33.289
The cell wall is thick.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.546
Those hairs look like cilia.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.673
Longer than we're used to seeing on Earth.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.220
More like flagella.

10:43.935 --> 10:46.427
- What's our temperature?
- Minus 110.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.479
Start bringing it up.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.514
Minus 82.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.063
Even quicker.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.443
Minus 55.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.193
This is some Re-Animator shit.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.403
That's a very obscure reference.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.489
- Not for a nerd.
- Not if you're a nerd.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.995
Minus 17.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.536
Zero degrees.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.332
Come on.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.210
Eighteen...

11:15.300 --> 11:17.041
Nineteen...

11:17.135 --> 11:19.343
20 degrees Celsius.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.385
Nothing.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.141
Update?

11:33.610 --> 11:35.602
I'm gonna try a different atmosphere.

11:36.779 --> 11:39.943
Closer to Proterozoic Earth
than today's Mars.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.441
Less oxygen...

11:42.994 --> 11:44.860
More carbon dioxide.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.453
And then, when Sho's ready,

11:48.625 --> 11:50.036
a growth medium.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.206
In this case, glucose.

11:56.966 --> 11:57.956
Come on, dance.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.065
Did it just move?

12:24.494 --> 12:26.030
Hugh?

12:35.004 --> 12:35.994
My God.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.883
It worked. You woke it.

12:44.347 --> 12:46.885
We're looking at
the first incontrovertible proof

12:46.975 --> 12:49.137
of life beyond Earth.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.728
It's beautiful.

13:13.376 --> 13:16.119
Our first question is from Allen.
He's nine years old.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.704
And, Allen, what is your question
for Commander Golovkina?

13:19.048 --> 13:20.038
Is it green?

13:20.133 --> 13:23.126
It isn't visible at all, actually.
It's microscopic.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.380
A single cell.

13:24.721 --> 13:28.055
To put it into perspective,
your body is made up of trillions.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.554
There's an alien inside of me?

13:31.394 --> 13:33.226
I bet your teacher sometimes thinks so.

13:33.688 --> 13:36.021
Well, we have another question
from 8-year-old Mari.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.440
Are you bringing the alien back to Earth?

13:38.568 --> 13:41.402
No, we're gonna keep it up here.
We're gonna study it where it's safe.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.232
Commander?

13:43.323 --> 13:46.987
The ISS is the most expensive house
ever built.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.160
$200 billion American and counting.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.158
Because we keep adding rooms.

13:52.248 --> 13:55.366
It flies around Earth 16 times a day.

13:56.085 --> 13:59.294
In 30 years, over 100 people have lived here,

13:59.922 --> 14:03.211
thanks to generous countries
like Russia, the USA, and China.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.042
We call this Tranquility Node.

14:05.720 --> 14:10.090
Dr. Jordan here is about to break the record
for consecutive days in space.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.846
Four hundred and seventy-three, straight.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.676
Your mommy must miss you.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.680
She does.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.391
But I have family here.

14:20.485 --> 14:24.069
Yeah, the kind that teases him
'cause his mommy misses him.

14:24.155 --> 14:26.442
This is one of our newest crew members.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.149
Miranda North from
the Centers for Disease Control.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.484
She's a doctor, too.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.615
You guys are witnessing a space triathlon.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.821
Yeah, I'm winning.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.204
We have another question
from 7-year-old Leila.

14:37.293 --> 14:40.001
We think this question is a little personal.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.796
- Go ahead.
- How do you go to the bathroom?

14:43.800 --> 14:44.836
Funnel,

14:45.968 --> 14:47.334
tube,

14:47.970 --> 14:49.552
and some suction.

14:50.473 --> 14:54.513
Everything we do on the ISS
is like everything you do on Earth.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.644
Except different. Do you like peas?

14:57.730 --> 14:58.846
Yep.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.565
So, have you got a name yet?

15:09.659 --> 15:12.322
For that, we want to go down live
just outside our studio in Times Square

15:12.412 --> 15:14.404
to one very brave classmate.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.864
- Hi, Dominique.
- Hi.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.034
Calvin Coolidge Elementary

15:20.128 --> 15:24.247
was chosen among 11,000 schools

15:24.340 --> 15:25.922
for this honor.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.092
We name the Martian

15:29.470 --> 15:31.553
after our school.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.176
"Calvin."

15:41.732 --> 15:44.224
Control? Control?

15:44.318 --> 15:45.934
If you're listening, and you probably are,

15:46.028 --> 15:47.439
'cause you're creepy that way,

15:47.530 --> 15:50.113
can I just rant for a second
about the micromanagement?

15:50.199 --> 15:51.735
We're not blood-filled meat puppets.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.158
I come from a long line of plumbers.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.110
I can fix a shower.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.617
If I can't...
Well, Hugh doesn't shower anyway,

15:57.707 --> 15:59.118
he's British.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.120
- First international incident.
- I'm not being critical of you.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.372
You're just a very under-bathed nation.
Everybody knows it.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.329
Don't be an ugly American.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.672
Who's ugly now?

16:07.758 --> 16:10.341
I nailed Step 17.
I'm a very good-looking American,

16:10.428 --> 16:12.465
you know? I see, it's right there.

16:12.555 --> 16:13.796
Control, I'm sorry about him.

16:13.890 --> 16:14.880
Rory, Control can't hear you.

16:14.974 --> 16:15.964
I don't know where rage like that comes from.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.720
- Can you please fix the shower?
- Twenty-eight steps to fix a shower.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.598
You know, I can do this myself.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.146
No, I know. You just haven't.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.525
Doctors are always so bad
at looking after themselves, aren't they?

16:34.368 --> 16:36.030
You've spent too much time up here, David.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.369
Your atrophy's accelerated.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.577
And you're close to your radiation limit.

16:43.044 --> 16:46.663
You noticed any glowing in the dark?

16:53.471 --> 16:55.053
I like it up here.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.718
When I was in the military, we'd go to Syria.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.222
You know.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.847
We'd set up a hospital,

17:06.692 --> 17:11.278
treat all the casualties,
and then we'd come back a week...

17:11.364 --> 17:12.354
A week or two later,

17:12.448 --> 17:15.941
and then the whole village
would just be bombed out.

17:21.123 --> 17:24.036
Then Earth isn't all Syria, though, is it?

17:28.965 --> 17:31.378
I can't stand what we do
to each other down there.

17:33.135 --> 17:36.003
But it's home, and it's beautiful.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.801
Don't you miss anything?

17:39.642 --> 17:43.636
Don't you miss fresh water or birds

17:44.438 --> 17:45.804
or the trees?

17:48.609 --> 17:51.522
I like the hum up here.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.278
And the air.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.048
What you have achieved with Calvin
is remarkable, Hugh.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.803
I haven't had a chance to say that.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.103
Thank you.

18:27.189 --> 18:30.023
I think these will prove to be
the greatest days of my life.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.854
I wish I had a time machine,
so I could visit the 10-year-old me.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.694
Did he want to be an astronaut?

18:39.744 --> 18:41.451
He wanted out of the wheelchair.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.868
And how does he feel now?

18:48.044 --> 18:49.501
Like a bird.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.629
Don't get me wrong.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.803
I don't hate my chair.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.634
I love it.

19:03.351 --> 19:06.219
For the sake of the anonymous genius
who invented it.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.643
You're one of a kind, Hugh.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.229
Good night.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.749
11:20 UTC.

19:38.386 --> 19:41.424
Hold on to your helmets.
The glucose intake is very rapid.

19:42.932 --> 19:46.516
The specimen's cells have begun
to move together en masse as a unit.

19:47.603 --> 19:53.019
They're also sharing electrical activity
in what resembles a growing neural network.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.100
Notice I didn't say "brain."

19:56.404 --> 19:57.861
Dr. North speaking.

19:57.947 --> 20:01.190
It is our educated opinion
that this new species is not a colony

20:01.283 --> 20:03.525
of fast-dividing single-celled organisms,

20:03.619 --> 20:05.861
but one larger, solitary organism

20:05.955 --> 20:09.323
composed of trillions
of identical cooperative cells.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.700
Here's what's fascinating.

20:11.794 --> 20:14.036
I mean, it's all fascinating, isn't it?

20:15.339 --> 20:16.921
Unlike most multicellular organisms,

20:17.633 --> 20:21.092
every cell of Calvin's can perform
every somatic function on its own.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.796
Every single cell is

20:24.890 --> 20:27.598
simultaneously a muscle cell

20:27.685 --> 20:31.224
and a nerve cell and a photoreceptive cell.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.475
So the creature, as a whole,

20:33.566 --> 20:36.775
is, in a very real sense, all muscle,

20:37.319 --> 20:39.436
all brain, all eye.

20:40.322 --> 20:44.817
As such, Calvin now possesses the means
to interact with its environment,

20:45.286 --> 20:49.872
including the use of
what appears to be proto-appendages.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.038
I'll demonstrate.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.355
But notice how it's approaching
and not retreating.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.900
Its curiosity outweighs its fear.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.495
That's beautiful.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.358
Hello, Calvin.

22:03.197 --> 22:04.529
How's that feel, Hugh?

22:05.449 --> 22:07.156
You're gonna be a daddy.

22:09.119 --> 22:11.236
There's gonna be
a big custody battle over this one.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.624
One day, we're all gonna die,

22:16.710 --> 22:19.748
and I want to know if there'd be
even the possibility of having...

22:23.884 --> 22:25.420
I'm getting a little nauseous.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.715
You can do this, Kazumi.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.088
I'm doing my best.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.589
It's coming.

22:31.767 --> 22:32.848
Any moment now, okay, push.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.927
Easy for you to say.

22:36.105 --> 22:37.562
You can do it, Kazumi.

22:38.232 --> 22:39.848
You can do it, you can do it.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.354
Sho...

22:42.945 --> 22:44.561
I can see it. Okay, push.

22:44.738 --> 22:45.728
It's okay.

22:45.823 --> 22:46.904
Push.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.532
You'll be able to meet Mei soon.

22:49.618 --> 22:50.950
You can do it.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.161
"...and that there was more of it
during the night.

22:53.247 --> 22:56.285
"We can observe, too,
how the recollection of a dream,

22:56.375 --> 22:58.867
"which was still lively in the morning,

22:58.961 --> 23:01.829
"will melt away,
except for a few small fragments..."

23:01.922 --> 23:04.380
This book doesn't have pictures in it,
does it?

23:04.466 --> 23:05.502
Obviously not.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.758
Would you prefer
that I don't read it out loud?

23:07.845 --> 23:09.711
- That's beautiful.
- Beautiful.

23:11.265 --> 23:13.302
- He makes me cry.
- Hi, guys. Guys.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.383
- Meet Mei.
- Hey!

23:17.021 --> 23:18.728
- Hi, Mei!
- Hey, Mei!

23:19.565 --> 23:22.148
- Say hi to everybody, Mei.
- Hi, Mei.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.975
- She's beautiful!
- Congratulations.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.277
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.854
Do they have any idea who the father is?

23:27.948 --> 23:30.031
- Shut up.
- Another one, another one.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.324
Okay.

23:31.785 --> 23:32.775
For story time.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.740
It was my favorite.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.742
You might say my first foray into space.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.408
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Commander.

23:39.501 --> 23:40.537
- Thank you, guys.
- She's beautiful, Sho.

23:40.628 --> 23:41.618
Thank you!

23:42.504 --> 23:44.496
No, seriously, that kid had blue eyes.

25:03.002 --> 25:03.992
Fuck.

25:07.256 --> 25:08.792
It's the lab.

25:34.408 --> 25:36.946
Okay. Miranda,
check the O2 in the lab. Is it...

25:37.036 --> 25:39.028
O2's on 21. We're clear for contamination.

25:39.121 --> 25:41.534
We're okay. Calvin's safe.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.364
I don't understand how this happened.

25:43.459 --> 25:44.995
Nothing in that lab can malfunction.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.951
A clamp. It failed.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.878
- It's on me.
- Yeah, no shit it's on you.

25:48.964 --> 25:51.126
A dizzy 5-year-old could have spotted that.

25:51.258 --> 25:53.420
Protecting these firewalls, yes,
that's my job.

25:53.510 --> 25:54.546
But I can't do it alone.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.878
Kibo wasn't designed
for strict firewall lockdown,

25:56.972 --> 25:58.179
and neither was the station.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.972
There is zero precedent for any of this.

26:00.267 --> 26:03.226
But you do not come out of that lab
without triple-checking everything.

26:03.604 --> 26:06.312
You do not go into that lab
without a proper rest.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.394
For all I know,
we're carrying anthrax onboard.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.066
You can't compare Calvin to anthrax.

26:10.152 --> 26:13.611
Yeah, I know at least five guys
back home who can do my job.

26:14.323 --> 26:15.655
Nobody can do yours except you.

26:16.366 --> 26:19.575
I don't want to be around that thing.
I'm not qualified to be around that thing.

26:19.661 --> 26:20.742
- I understand.
- Good.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.286
I'm just saying
you can't compare Calvin to anthrax.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.113
Stop... Stop calling it fucking "Calvin."

26:24.208 --> 26:26.416
We don't know what that thing is. Yeah?

26:26.502 --> 26:27.993
And you're in there,
and you're playing around with it

26:28.087 --> 26:29.328
like it's your buddy.

26:31.131 --> 26:33.293
I'm your buddy.
You're drunk on this. Wake up.

26:33.383 --> 26:36.421
This isn't and will never be
a controlled experiment.

26:36.512 --> 26:39.175
So let's all agree
we made our first and last mistake.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.721
I miss my fucking dog.

26:40.808 --> 26:42.174
Good night.

26:49.441 --> 26:53.276
Dr. Miranda North,
quarantine officer, 2320 UTC.

26:53.362 --> 26:56.321
After weeks of stunning growth and activity,

26:56.406 --> 26:59.023
Calvin is completely inactive.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.735
We believe it's likely due to
the clamp failure in the lab,

27:01.829 --> 27:04.321
which caused a temporary change
of air pressure in Calvin's box.

27:05.499 --> 27:06.535
Our working theory is that

27:06.625 --> 27:09.743
this hibernation may be a defense mechanism.

27:09.837 --> 27:11.123
Everyone here is on edge,

27:11.213 --> 27:13.796
and Hugh, of course,
has been beating himself up,

27:13.882 --> 27:16.625
but, honestly, I'm relieved.

27:17.094 --> 27:18.585
Calvin was growing very fast,

27:19.138 --> 27:20.299
and this has now given me time

27:20.389 --> 27:23.132
to reinforce firewall precautions
with the crew.

27:23.225 --> 27:26.889
The box must stay sealed,
the lab must stay sealed,

27:27.312 --> 27:29.053
no matter the risk to Calvin.

27:31.275 --> 27:32.891
It's just floating.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.354
Because of my mistake in the lab.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.235
And it was going so well.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.112
What?

27:42.828 --> 27:45.115
Something my dad used to say.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.739
"It was all going so well."

27:48.333 --> 27:52.498
I'm toying with the idea
of stimulating it electrically.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.921
- What do you think?
- That's not my call.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.373
But if it were?

27:57.134 --> 27:58.500
I don't know.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.176
My job is lines of defense.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.841
Imagine the worst thing
that could ever happen,

28:02.931 --> 28:04.172
and then the worst after that,

28:04.266 --> 28:07.179
and the worst after that, and then I...

28:07.269 --> 28:09.932
- I've planned for all of them.
- I understand that.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.979
But risks are taken for reasons.

28:12.065 --> 28:14.682
Because of Calvin,
we're gonna learn so much about life.

28:14.776 --> 28:18.486
Its origin, its nature,
maybe even its meaning.

28:18.572 --> 28:20.484
- No, I know.
- You're a doctor.

28:21.325 --> 28:22.782
Stem cell research.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.743
What if Calvin could make
stem cells obsolete?

28:27.497 --> 28:29.489
Help cure the incurable...

28:30.459 --> 28:31.791
Reverse the irreversible.

28:32.669 --> 28:34.205
I have to fix this.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.420
Good. Are you ready?

28:36.506 --> 28:37.963
- Stretch.
- Okay.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.461
And relax.

28:49.686 --> 28:50.802
Ready.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.099
You sure it won't hurt it?

28:53.190 --> 28:54.806
It's a very, very low voltage.

28:55.651 --> 28:57.438
We're only stimulating it.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.522
What exactly are you hoping for?

29:00.322 --> 29:01.779
I'm hoping to wake him up.

29:03.242 --> 29:06.861
We're seeing under what conditions
it reengages with its environment.

29:12.626 --> 29:13.958
Come on in.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.335
We're shocking the monkey.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.502
Trying another spot.

29:31.019 --> 29:34.137
Nothing. Not even at a cellular level.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.939
Are you sure it's not dead?

29:37.025 --> 29:39.733
It's alive. It's just in a deep sleep.

29:40.362 --> 29:41.478
Come on, Calvin.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.114
Wake up.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.361
Shit!

29:52.165 --> 29:53.155
What's wrong?

29:53.458 --> 29:54.824
It broke the wand.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.924
I'm gonna try and pull my hand out.

30:04.011 --> 30:06.503
Do that, but just make sure
to protect the glove.

30:07.389 --> 30:09.756
- Shit.
- It's gripping the glass.

30:09.850 --> 30:10.886
Okay, okay.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.646
Little sod.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.520
How hard is it holding on to you?

30:19.609 --> 30:21.692
- Like a firm handshake.
- It's fine.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.111
It doesn't hurt, but it's growing strong.

30:24.197 --> 30:26.280
- What's the problem?
- It's got Hugh's hand.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.821
His heart rate is at 165.

30:30.203 --> 30:33.162
- Sho, can we trust the glove?
- It's very tight.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.456
Glove's not going anywhere. It's fine.

30:35.542 --> 30:36.498
Shit.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.668
Okay, but just relax. Tell him to relax.

30:38.754 --> 30:40.461
- Derry? Derry, look at me.
- Tell him to calm down.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.709
Look at me. Relax. Just relax your hand.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.174
Okay.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.922
It's in between my fingers.

30:49.264 --> 30:50.345
Can I make a suggestion?

30:50.432 --> 30:52.014
Can I just...
Can I go in there and get him and...

30:52.100 --> 30:53.511
No, you're not going to go in there.

30:53.602 --> 30:55.594
No, of course you're not,
because we have to maintain quarantine.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.599
- Stop.
- No, I can do this. I can. I can do this.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.430
- Can you try and distract it?
- Yes, yes.

30:59.900 --> 31:01.482
I'll see if I can interest it in the wand.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.403
Come on, my favorite little Martian.

31:08.450 --> 31:09.611
Come on.

31:11.453 --> 31:12.489
Come on.

31:13.455 --> 31:14.741
Come on.

31:18.752 --> 31:19.993
Come on.

31:21.797 --> 31:22.787
Come on.

31:27.260 --> 31:28.671
He lost interest.

31:33.350 --> 31:34.636
It's got hold of my hand.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.728
- Hugh?
- Hugh?

31:42.818 --> 31:43.808
Hugh?

31:45.153 --> 31:47.065
- Hey, Hugh?
- Hugh?

31:56.164 --> 31:57.245
Help me! Help me!

31:57.332 --> 31:58.823
- What the fuck is going on?
- No, no one's going in!

31:58.917 --> 32:00.874
- Come on. Who's going in?
- Wait!

32:01.002 --> 32:02.493
- Wait for fucking what?
- Screw it. I'm going in there.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.002
Don't do this.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.254
I don't give a shit
about your fucking quarantine!

32:09.344 --> 32:11.085
There's nothing to protect you.
You're not going in there.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.636
Who gives you the fucking jurisdiction?

32:12.722 --> 32:13.838
- Just open the door, Rory.
- Wait, wait.

32:16.393 --> 32:17.600
You're not going in there.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.598
- Let him in!
- You're not going in there. No.

32:23.024 --> 32:25.186
- Wait, wait, wait.
- You're not going in.

32:39.416 --> 32:40.657
He's out.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.871
He's out.

32:46.673 --> 32:47.880
Guys, look at it.

32:56.391 --> 32:57.472
Jesus.

32:57.559 --> 32:58.845
What are his vitals?

32:58.935 --> 33:00.597
126 and dropping.

33:01.438 --> 33:02.804
What's it doing?

33:33.094 --> 33:34.505
Holy shit.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.091
Jesus Christ.

33:45.941 --> 33:48.103
You guys got eyes on it anywhere?

33:50.320 --> 33:52.437
Okay, there. There.

33:58.161 --> 33:59.777
Guys?

34:39.828 --> 34:40.818
Fuck this.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.574
- No!
- Let him go.

34:42.664 --> 34:44.155
Hey, buddy.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.416
Watch his hand.

34:51.505 --> 34:52.496
- There we go.
- It's there.

34:54.676 --> 34:56.167
Get him in. Adams!

35:00.932 --> 35:03.595
- Yeah.
- David, I need you here.

35:06.646 --> 35:09.184
Rory, I can't let you out.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.771
Shit.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.568
Oh, gosh.

35:14.696 --> 35:16.028
- There we go.
- Hugh? Hugh?

35:16.114 --> 35:18.276
- Look at me.
- Just listen to me for a second, okay?

35:18.366 --> 35:19.356
Hey, guys?

35:19.451 --> 35:21.363
Sho, can you find a bandage?

35:21.453 --> 35:22.443
Suggestions?

35:22.537 --> 35:24.119
Get an oxygen candle.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.367
- Burn it off.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.203
Just look at me.

35:29.294 --> 35:30.455
Look at me. It's fine.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.056
Fuck.

35:50.190 --> 35:51.726
Okay, all right, what now?

35:55.570 --> 35:56.606
How do we get him out?

35:56.696 --> 35:58.653
We need to get Calvin
back behind Firewall One,

35:58.740 --> 36:00.777
and once he's there, we can pull Rory out.

36:00.867 --> 36:01.857
Fuck this.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.364
Permission to fucking kill the thing.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.283
Commander?

36:09.417 --> 36:10.407
Kill it.

36:11.252 --> 36:12.242
Sho?

36:12.754 --> 36:15.963
- Any suggestions?
- What about the incinerator?

36:16.049 --> 36:17.165
I like that.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.499
All right, genius. Here.

36:20.261 --> 36:22.469
Close the red valve. Disengage the clamp.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.509
Disconnect the hose.

36:24.599 --> 36:25.680
Be careful, Rory.

36:25.767 --> 36:28.009
- Fuck!
- There's limited fuel.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.311
Copy. Okay.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.938
- Manual override.
- Thank you.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.646
Okay.

36:45.662 --> 36:46.652
Rory, I...

36:48.289 --> 36:49.496
Yeah.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.385
Fuck!

37:10.061 --> 37:11.848
You're wasting too much fuel.

37:16.651 --> 37:17.812
No!

37:20.280 --> 37:21.646
Fuck.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.239
Rory!

37:34.294 --> 37:35.284
Rory!

37:36.004 --> 37:36.994
Hey!

37:38.006 --> 37:40.248
Rory, stop. Stop.

37:40.341 --> 37:41.707
Rory!

37:47.974 --> 37:51.012
Rory? You're out of fuel.

38:14.501 --> 38:15.537
It's behind you!

38:35.104 --> 38:37.266
- Jesus.
- Fuck.

38:38.399 --> 38:40.106
Somebody open the fucking door!

38:40.193 --> 38:42.150
Open the portal now! Just open the portal.

38:42.237 --> 38:43.603
There's a man in there getting strangled.

38:43.696 --> 38:46.188
- Rory? What is he saying? Rory?
- I can't, no matter what's happening.

38:46.282 --> 38:47.989
Kat. Kat! We got to open the door!

38:48.076 --> 38:49.487
- No! No one's going in! It's protocol!
- Rory?

38:49.577 --> 38:51.193
- What is this fucking protocol?
- Jordan, no!

38:51.287 --> 38:52.653
- Just open the portal!
- Rory?

38:52.747 --> 38:54.864
- There's a man dying in there!
- Nobody open the fucking...

38:54.958 --> 38:56.494
Rory, look at me, look at me.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.826
Rory, we can't hear you
if you take your comm out.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.502
I need to see what's happening!

39:00.588 --> 39:03.501
- Rory! Rory?
- Rory!

39:03.591 --> 39:05.253
Will you turn around? Can you turn around?

39:05.343 --> 39:07.050
There's a man dying in there!

39:07.136 --> 39:09.469
We can't hear you if you take your comm out!

39:09.597 --> 39:11.008
No! No, you are not going in!

39:11.099 --> 39:12.715
- Help him!
- Open the door!

39:12.809 --> 39:15.176
Don't open the door, okay?
Don't open the door!

39:15.270 --> 39:16.226
Stay back!

39:16.312 --> 39:18.895
I need to see your face. Can you turn around?

39:18.982 --> 39:21.269
Can you turn around?

40:27.592 --> 40:28.673
Guys.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.626
Guys.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.305
Sho.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.378
That's so much bigger.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.217
Jesus.

41:16.849 --> 41:17.885
Guys?

41:17.976 --> 41:19.888
- Sho.
- Guys, it's trying to get out.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.060
The CPU overrode us.

41:22.146 --> 41:23.637
It's searching for a way out.

41:23.773 --> 41:26.311
- The system won't give me access to it.
- Full manual.

41:26.401 --> 41:28.438
Shut them down, okay?

41:31.406 --> 41:33.022
How smart is this thing?

41:33.408 --> 41:35.149
It feels the airflow.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.325
I can't control them all at once.

41:37.412 --> 41:38.619
Then shut them one by one.

41:43.876 --> 41:44.866
Seal the lab.

41:45.795 --> 41:48.629
- Just shut it down! Shut it down now!
- We are on it.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.313
Guys, it's gone.

42:16.909 --> 42:19.322
- It got out.
- Where did it go?

42:19.412 --> 42:21.324
Could be anywhere now.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.913
Firewall Two has failed.

42:35.803 --> 42:36.839
Kat.

42:37.930 --> 42:40.013
We need to reestablish quarantine.

42:41.184 --> 42:42.800
And get a distress call out.

42:44.687 --> 42:46.269
Control, this is Station.

42:46.606 --> 42:47.938
Station for Control.

42:48.024 --> 42:49.890
The specimen's location is unknown.

42:49.984 --> 42:52.226
It is to be considered hostile and deadly.

42:52.320 --> 42:56.655
Our intent is to isolate and destroy it
in compliance with protocol.

42:57.325 --> 43:00.739
We'll continue said course of action
unless otherwise instructed.

43:00.995 --> 43:04.159
- Please acknowledge and advise...
- Kat? Kat. We lost them.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.786
- How much of that went out?
- Some.

43:06.876 --> 43:08.367
I think.

43:09.462 --> 43:10.919
There is no way to be sure.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.997
Looks like communications just failed.

43:13.466 --> 43:14.752
Can we talk to each other?

43:15.468 --> 43:18.176
David. It's Kat.

43:18.679 --> 43:19.920
Do you copy?

43:21.057 --> 43:22.639
Go for David.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.591
So, we've lost contact with Earth.

43:24.685 --> 43:26.972
I don't think... Wait.

43:28.106 --> 43:30.598
Yes, outside communications are down.

43:30.691 --> 43:32.728
- Could the sprinklers affect comms?
- No.

43:33.277 --> 43:35.314
They're independent systems.

43:35.404 --> 43:37.111
Can we run a diagnostic from here?

43:41.035 --> 43:42.992
The transmitter has failed.

43:43.079 --> 43:47.369
But we have to go outside to access it
and get Earth back online.

43:48.042 --> 43:49.078
Then I have to walk.

43:50.628 --> 43:51.914
Let me.

43:53.047 --> 43:54.208
No.

43:55.007 --> 43:58.045
After Rory, I'm best qualified
for walk-and-repair.

44:04.350 --> 44:05.340
This is not protocol.

44:05.434 --> 44:07.767
It's way too risky
for you to go out there and

44:07.854 --> 44:09.186
fix the comms.

44:09.272 --> 44:11.184
We don't know where Calvin is.

44:12.191 --> 44:13.602
You haven't had your nitrogen detox.

44:13.693 --> 44:15.059
Your health is my responsibility.

44:15.528 --> 44:17.190
- I'll be fine.
- Yeah.

44:17.280 --> 44:18.566
What is it you say?

44:21.033 --> 44:22.490
"Slow is fast," right?

44:22.577 --> 44:24.694
Yeah. Slow to go fast.

44:24.787 --> 44:27.575
Yeah. Well, that's out the window.

44:28.207 --> 44:30.164
We can escape in the lifeboats.

44:30.251 --> 44:32.743
Earth is the responsibility.
Nothing goes down to the planet.

44:33.921 --> 44:35.958
It was stipulated. In writing.

44:36.048 --> 44:39.086
What are you talking about?
What was stipulated in writing?

44:41.929 --> 44:43.465
What was stipulated?

44:47.059 --> 44:49.176
David, first things first.

44:49.270 --> 44:53.139
When we're back in touch with Control,
we'll turn our attention to Calvin.

44:55.943 --> 44:57.354
Don't worry.

45:03.409 --> 45:05.651
Rate, 61 beats a minute.

45:05.745 --> 45:08.158
Pressure, 97 over 53.

45:09.123 --> 45:10.955
I'd hate to see you relaxed.

45:11.042 --> 45:13.955
But she is relaxed. Aren't you, Kat?

45:14.045 --> 45:15.707
Suit's running warm.

45:16.464 --> 45:18.547
Like Siberia in summer.

45:25.514 --> 45:27.301
I'm at the transmitter.

45:28.726 --> 45:31.059
Commencing on-site diagnostic.

45:34.065 --> 45:35.306
It's overheated.

45:35.983 --> 45:37.224
I can tell.

45:37.944 --> 45:39.185
How?

45:39.278 --> 45:40.814
I see scorching.

45:42.490 --> 45:44.903
I want to check the coolant levels.

45:44.992 --> 45:47.405
Is it possible
Calvin could have gotten into coolant?

45:47.495 --> 45:48.485
Possible.

45:49.372 --> 45:50.453
We have to know.

45:55.878 --> 45:59.167
- There is the issue.
- Commander?

46:00.007 --> 46:01.623
It's bone-dry.

46:01.717 --> 46:03.424
Calvin is a carbon-based organism.

46:03.511 --> 46:05.844
It needs food, water,
and oxygen, just like us.

46:05.930 --> 46:09.094
We have to consider the possibility
it consumed the coolant for food.

46:09.183 --> 46:12.802
David, could you list
all the water sources aboard?

46:12.895 --> 46:13.931
Pure or otherwise.

46:14.355 --> 46:16.813
There's plenty of drinking water,

46:16.899 --> 46:20.483
there's coolant for the comms,
coolant for the CPU...

46:22.530 --> 46:23.520
There's coolant for the spacesuits.

46:25.616 --> 46:26.857
Commander?

46:28.035 --> 46:30.778
Calvin just came out. It grabbed my suit.

46:37.086 --> 46:38.497
It's bigger.

46:41.841 --> 46:43.298
It's trying to get in.

46:43.384 --> 46:44.670
Trust your suit.

46:45.219 --> 46:47.211
- Can it breathe out there?
- No.

46:47.305 --> 46:49.672
But it might be able to
store oxygen for a period of time.

46:49.765 --> 46:51.051
I'm closing the valve.

46:56.564 --> 46:57.725
It's squeezing.

46:58.649 --> 46:59.981
Kat. Kat, are you okay?

47:00.067 --> 47:02.559
Yes. The suit's thick enough.

47:02.653 --> 47:06.272
It's twisting up your leg.
Go. Go to the airlock now.

47:06.365 --> 47:09.608
Fuck this. I'm headed for the airlock.
I'm burning this fucker off.

47:10.077 --> 47:11.784
Kat, focus on meeting David.

47:12.330 --> 47:14.117
We'll worry about the comms later.

47:14.665 --> 47:15.655
Sho?

47:21.213 --> 47:22.329
There's liquid in the helmet.

47:23.049 --> 47:25.757
Calvin must have broken my coolant loop.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.800
Kat, there is enough coolant.

47:27.887 --> 47:29.344
Yes, I know.

47:29.430 --> 47:30.671
I know.

47:31.849 --> 47:33.886
David, meet me at the airlock.

47:34.518 --> 47:35.884
What? Yeah. Go, go, go!

47:35.978 --> 47:37.469
It's squeezing harder.

47:37.563 --> 47:39.725
Calvin cracked
the coolant system in her suit.

47:40.274 --> 47:42.436
Commander, Calvin knows
exactly what it's doing.

47:42.943 --> 47:44.400
It's growing smarter.

47:45.029 --> 47:46.736
The liquid, it's blocking my vision.

47:49.617 --> 47:51.279
I don't have time.

47:51.369 --> 47:52.655
I've got to jump.

47:52.745 --> 47:55.488
- Kat, the tether won't reach.
- I'm unclipping.

48:00.503 --> 48:02.119
- Kat?
- No comments!

48:02.213 --> 48:03.829
I've got to jump.

48:35.830 --> 48:37.412
David, I've taken Kat off the channel.

48:37.498 --> 48:39.114
Look, she's not gonna tell you this,

48:39.208 --> 48:41.916
but her heart is beating out of her chest.
She's drowning.

48:42.503 --> 48:43.914
So just be prepared, she may not be rational.

48:44.004 --> 48:44.960
Copy that.

48:45.047 --> 48:46.754
Sho, I have no time for EVA.

48:46.841 --> 48:47.831
I'm using the launch suit.

48:47.925 --> 48:49.291
- It's not designed for this.
- I know.

48:49.385 --> 48:51.377
- There's not enough protection.
- I know. Don't worry.

48:51.470 --> 48:53.257
- Kat is less than a minute out.
- Vent the airlock.

48:53.347 --> 48:54.508
- What about decompression?
- Just do it.

48:54.598 --> 48:55.930
- It's gonna hurt.
- Come on, do it!

48:56.016 --> 48:57.177
- Is your helmet sealed?
- Sho!

49:08.654 --> 49:11.317
Guys, we are running out of time.

49:19.081 --> 49:21.539
Kat, Kat! Don't swallow it.

49:22.042 --> 49:24.034
It's toxic, okay?

49:25.254 --> 49:27.496
I need you to help me open the valve.

49:27.590 --> 49:29.377
We're gonna do this together.

49:30.217 --> 49:31.674
Okay?

49:33.095 --> 49:34.461
I'm gonna pull down,

49:34.555 --> 49:36.888
and you're gonna go clockwise from your side.

49:39.602 --> 49:40.638
Okay?

49:40.728 --> 49:41.969
There you go.

49:42.563 --> 49:43.724
Good, good, good.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.153
Don't worry about Calvin.

49:52.239 --> 49:54.356
We're gonna get you inside,
and we're gonna get it off.

49:58.871 --> 49:59.987
David.

50:01.499 --> 50:02.580
Kat?

50:03.375 --> 50:05.082
No, no, no. Clockwise from your side.

50:06.295 --> 50:07.831
Clockwise from your side.

50:08.589 --> 50:09.545
Kat, come on.

50:09.632 --> 50:10.748
- Miranda?
- Yeah, I'm here.

50:11.258 --> 50:13.716
She's fighting me!
She's turned her lever the wrong way.

50:13.802 --> 50:14.792
Pull down...

50:19.433 --> 50:21.641
Kat. You're fighting me, Kat. Come on.

50:21.727 --> 50:22.843
We got to do it together, now.

50:22.937 --> 50:24.553
- Come on. Kat, come on, please.
- David.

50:24.647 --> 50:26.104
Kat!

50:26.524 --> 50:27.856
- Kat. Kat!
- Look at me!

50:27.942 --> 50:29.934
Just pull on the lever! Okay?

50:30.486 --> 50:32.853
Kat, come on! Come on!

50:32.947 --> 50:34.108
Just pull down on the lever!

50:35.407 --> 50:37.069
- David...
- Kat!

50:37.159 --> 50:38.650
Come on, you can do this!

50:38.744 --> 50:40.531
David, she's doing it deliberately.

50:43.082 --> 50:44.243
Come on!

50:45.292 --> 50:46.453
Kat!

50:47.878 --> 50:50.291
- Kat!
- David, stop.

50:51.298 --> 50:52.630
Stop.

50:56.762 --> 50:59.129
She's not letting Calvin back in here.

51:00.975 --> 51:02.182
Kat?

51:07.064 --> 51:08.430
Commander.

51:34.425 --> 51:36.542
Kat, Kat...

51:46.854 --> 51:48.720
What is going on?

51:52.067 --> 51:54.024
What is going on?

52:27.728 --> 52:29.640
Guys, guys, do you copy?

52:32.441 --> 52:33.477
Yeah.

52:34.193 --> 52:35.900
- Yeah, I copy.
- Okay, okay...

52:38.572 --> 52:40.108
Let's keep it together.

52:42.409 --> 52:45.447
We may have...
We may have an opportunity here.

52:47.247 --> 52:49.660
Calvin's ability to survive
in that vacuum and temperature

52:49.750 --> 52:51.582
is astonishing.

52:52.503 --> 52:54.916
But he can't live much longer out there.

52:57.633 --> 52:59.590
Sho. Sho.

52:59.677 --> 53:03.296
Are you sure that we've lost
all communication with Earth?

53:03.681 --> 53:04.762
I am sure.

53:04.848 --> 53:07.215
All right, then we have to keep it out there.

53:07.309 --> 53:09.096
We have a new firewall.

53:11.313 --> 53:14.306
David, can you see it?

53:14.400 --> 53:15.607
I'll see.

53:16.485 --> 53:17.475
- Sho.
- Yes?

53:17.569 --> 53:19.185
Can you re-flood the airlock?

53:22.366 --> 53:23.607
You tell me when.

53:26.995 --> 53:28.327
Okay.

53:39.007 --> 53:40.839
Did she close that valve?

53:40.926 --> 53:42.383
Yeah, yeah, she closed it.

53:42.469 --> 53:43.676
Okay.

53:45.472 --> 53:46.963
What other way could it get in?

53:48.058 --> 53:49.424
The thrusters.

53:50.102 --> 53:51.889
The manifolds in the thruster nozzles.

53:51.979 --> 53:54.562
If it tries one, we could blast it off.

53:54.648 --> 53:56.856
But we'd have to know which.

53:56.942 --> 53:58.979
It's too dark. I can't see anything.

53:59.069 --> 54:00.355
- Shit.
- There must be some way.

54:02.656 --> 54:03.646
Thruster sensors.

54:04.533 --> 54:07.617
If it climbs in the nozzle,
the temperature should move.

54:07.703 --> 54:08.910
Should.

54:08.996 --> 54:10.157
All right.

54:14.460 --> 54:16.497
- There.
- Thruster two firing.

54:18.338 --> 54:20.830
Miranda, can you reach Tranquility?

54:22.676 --> 54:23.666
We missed. Cut it.

54:27.055 --> 54:28.091
Guys, it's heading toward... No, wait!

54:28.182 --> 54:29.969
No, no, it's heading towards
the lab. It's fast.

54:30.058 --> 54:31.549
I'm sorry, guys, I can't see.

54:31.643 --> 54:32.929
It's okay, we're watching.

54:35.731 --> 54:37.848
- Kibo.
- Thruster three firing.

54:49.828 --> 54:51.069
Come on.

54:52.956 --> 54:54.618
Please, please.

54:54.708 --> 54:55.698
Quest this time.

54:55.793 --> 54:56.829
- David, can you see?
- No, I'm...

54:56.919 --> 54:58.876
- Thruster five.
- Sorry. I'm sorry, I can't...

55:03.467 --> 55:04.457
Sho?

55:10.849 --> 55:12.010
What was that?

55:12.100 --> 55:13.807
We've burned through too much fuel.

55:13.894 --> 55:15.886
- There.
- We were already low after the Pilgrim.

55:16.563 --> 55:21.524
Doc, listen, all this thrusting,
we've placed ourselves into decaying orbit.

55:21.610 --> 55:23.522
- Shit.
- We'll reach atmosphere soon

55:23.612 --> 55:26.195
if I don't get us back to stable.

55:26.281 --> 55:28.568
And I'll need the rest of the fuel to do it,

55:28.659 --> 55:30.867
- if we even have that much.
- No. David?

55:30.953 --> 55:34.162
David, we can't risk Calvin
riding us down into the atmosphere, okay?

55:34.248 --> 55:36.114
But I don't know... Could it survive that?

55:36.208 --> 55:37.289
We don't know.

55:37.376 --> 55:41.252
It's already gone well beyond what any
living organism should be able to survive.

55:47.177 --> 55:50.386
If it's between letting it in here
or letting it down there,

55:50.472 --> 55:52.464
we let it in here.

55:52.975 --> 55:54.466
Where are you?

56:18.792 --> 56:20.954
We've just let it back in here.

56:25.591 --> 56:27.878
Moving us back into stable orbit.

56:34.099 --> 56:37.718
These creatures could have dominated Mars
for hundreds of millions of years.

56:38.353 --> 56:41.687
But now we know that they hibernate
with a loss of atmosphere.

56:41.773 --> 56:43.730
If we deprive it of air,

56:43.984 --> 56:46.476
retreat in Tranquility,
and seal ourselves off...

56:47.237 --> 56:49.149
And vent the rest of the station.

56:50.782 --> 56:51.898
Exactly.

56:51.992 --> 56:53.904
No life support, no life.

56:53.994 --> 56:54.984
Right.

56:56.163 --> 56:59.031
Okay, Hugh and I will sweep from Quest east.

56:59.791 --> 57:04.957
And you and Sho scour the poles
and lock off each compartment.

58:07.734 --> 58:11.478
It will take about four hours
to vent all oxygen.

58:11.571 --> 58:13.654
- What do we do till then?
- We wait.

58:18.078 --> 58:19.364
You okay?

58:21.373 --> 58:22.534
Derry, look at me.

58:23.542 --> 58:24.749
You okay?

58:25.585 --> 58:27.076
I'm fine.

58:39.975 --> 58:42.388
I remember the day the Challenger blew up.

58:44.354 --> 58:47.267
They took us out of school early,
I remember that day.

58:57.659 --> 58:59.901
It's hard to watch people die.

59:03.790 --> 59:05.122
Like...

59:08.045 --> 59:09.786
Fireworks.

59:11.840 --> 59:14.674
"Up, up

59:16.136 --> 59:18.970
"the long, delirious, burning blue

59:20.766 --> 59:24.601
"I've topped the wind-swept heights
with ease and grace"

59:28.857 --> 59:30.598
Best eulogy ever.

59:32.402 --> 59:33.893
Rory says,

59:34.946 --> 59:36.858
"Don't give me a eulogy.

59:38.658 --> 59:40.194
"Give me a parachute."

59:49.377 --> 59:50.913
He was my buddy.

59:55.717 --> 59:57.674
It's my fault.

59:58.720 --> 59:59.756
It's all my fault.

59:59.846 --> 01:00:03.305
Maybe it was your fault,
maybe it was my fault, maybe...

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.724
I don't know, it doesn't matter, does it?

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:10.555
Getting this thing on board was a risk,
and we knew it from the beginning.

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:14.017
I took it.

01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:16.443
It's just surviving.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:22.112
Life's very existence requires destruction.

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:26.370
Calvin doesn't hate us.

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.538
But he has to kill us

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:34.704
in order to survive.

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:44.096
Hugh.

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:46.799
- Hugh. Hugh.
- Hugh.

01:00:49.104 --> 01:00:50.220
All right, all right.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:52.805
- Hey.
- Derry?

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:53.980
Hugh?

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:55.433
I'm sorry.

01:00:57.779 --> 01:00:59.486
I'm sorry, because of all the...

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.816
- Hugh?
- Hugh?

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:06.035
Hugh?

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:08.989
Hugh? There's no output.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:11.415
God, get the defib.

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:15.790
- Get him back.
- Okay.

01:01:17.591 --> 01:01:19.082
- Get him down.
- I'll strap him in.

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:21.376
- Take off the sling, okay?
- Yeah.

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.344
Sho, get the ACLS kit and the defibrillator.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.138
Shit.

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:30.302
Here.

01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:31.681
Prep the defibrillator
and get the shocks down.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:33.512
- 360 joules.
- Yeah.

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:34.597
Copy, 360 joules.

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:36.774
Charging. Clear.

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:41.608
- Charging. Shooting.
- Still fibrillating.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:42.814
Just stack the shocks if you have to.

01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:44.399
- Go, 360.
- All right. Clear.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.656
Shit.

01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:49.370
- Nothing.
- Go again, 360.

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:50.822
- Go again. Hit him.
- Clear.

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:52.123
All right.

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:56.582
All right, all right. I got output.

01:01:56.671 --> 01:01:57.957
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:01.045
Okay, sinus rate 98 BPM.

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:02.792
You really scared me there, buddy.

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:05.211
David?

01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:09.298
David?

01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:12.305
Fuck.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.602
What is this?

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:16.021
Stabilizing.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:21.902
Get the plasma cutter.

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:23.445
Calvin's feeding off his leg.

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:27.032
Shit!

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:30.611
Miranda!

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:37.497
Go. Get out of here.

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:42.582
Let's go!

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:45.960
Miranda, let's go! Pull it away from Hugh.

01:02:46.054 --> 01:02:47.261
Sho.

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:49.179
- We'll come back for him!
- Miranda! Come on! Let's go!

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:51.174
Sho!

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:57.179
No!

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:02.605
Sho!

01:03:02.696 --> 01:03:04.562
No! Shit.

01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:19.710
Hey, guys?

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:22.922
Shit.

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:51.544
Calvin?

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:53.755
We don't know where he is.

01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:05.103
- Where's Sho?
- He'll be fine.

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:08.478
We stopped all oxygen venting in the station.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:20.827
Lift me up.

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:29.168
Okay.

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:30.340
Okay.

01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:32.506
Miranda.

01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:41.268
I'm up.

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:11.165
I'm coming home, Mei.

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:48.623
I know what I feel is not scientific.

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:50.124
It's not rational.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:53.875
I feel hate.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.052
I feel pure

01:06:57.931 --> 01:06:59.138
fucking

01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:01.715
hate for that thing.

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.479
Calvin.

01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:22.282
How is that moving like that?

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:25.413
He must have swallowed
the marker on Derry's leg.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:26.581
Yeah.

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:31.162
We can track him.

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:14.481
Let's kill this thing. Venting Zarya now.

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:28.529
Okay, it's suffocating.

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:31.491
- How long do you think that's gonna take?
- I don't know.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:32.665
Shit.

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:35.540
Proximity alert. Proximity alert.

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:38.464
Proximity alert. Proximity alert.

01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:39.756
Proximity...

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:41.542
They're coming.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.676
Kat's distress call must have reached Earth.

01:09:43.763 --> 01:09:44.924
Wait, where are they docking?

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:47.513
Shit.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.263
- Looks like Zarya.
- Jesus, that's where Calvin is.

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:54.145
Station to Soyuz.

01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:56.982
Station to Soyuz, do you copy?

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:00.151
Station to Soyuz, do you copy?

01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:03.401
- Station to Soyuz, do you copy?
- Try the flashlight.

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:08.160
Come on, come on.

01:10:10.248 --> 01:10:11.534
They can't see this.

01:10:13.334 --> 01:10:14.370
Must be too reflective.

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:27.341
Shit.

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:29.135
What the fuck are they doing?

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:30.428
David.

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:31.725
David!

01:10:32.186 --> 01:10:34.143
They're not coming to rescue us.

01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:36.972
It's Firewall Three.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.352
What?

01:10:39.777 --> 01:10:42.110
Firewall One was the box.

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:44.188
And Firewall Two was the lab.

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:48.655
And Firewall Three is the station.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:51.995
But we have a new firewall.

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:54.073
- What are you saying?
- They don't know that.

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:58.377
And if Firewall One or Two fail,
they have two choices.

01:10:58.796 --> 01:11:01.709
They can contain, or they expel.

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:08.880
They're pushing us out to deep space.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:13.388
They cannot risk Calvin reaching Earth.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:15.639
That was my protocol.

01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:20.016
I insisted from the beginning,
and the committee agreed.

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:23.443
They all put their names to it.

01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:25.904
The list is as long as your arm.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:29.073
Now, protecting firewalls is my job,

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.699
and if we would have succeeded,
we could have gone home.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.872
And if we failed...

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:44.873
Wait for me, Mei.

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:58.391
Sho. He thinks it's a rescue.

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:01.057
Oh, God. He's heading towards Calvin.

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.559
We have to stop him.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:16.197
Sho!

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:17.326
Sho, can you hear us?

01:12:57.415 --> 01:12:58.701
Sho!

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:04.711
Sho!

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:32.822
Sho!

01:13:33.701 --> 01:13:35.658
- Miranda!
- Sho!

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:42.575
Sho?

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:54.385
- Sho!
- Take my hand, Sho!

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:56.050
Don't let go, Sho!

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:13.939
No!

01:14:17.703 --> 01:14:19.285
No! No, don't let go!

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:24.950
Sho! No, Sho! No!

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:26.201
- No!
- Let go!

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:28.829
- No!
- No!

01:14:29.256 --> 01:14:32.044
No! Sho! Sho!

01:14:52.029 --> 01:14:53.520
Miranda!

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:00.402
No!

01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:02.328
- Come on!
- No!

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:03.405
Miranda!

01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:11.796
Miranda! Let's go!

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:07.769
The CPU is still up. It's a miracle.

01:16:08.856 --> 01:16:10.313
We're...

01:16:10.524 --> 01:16:11.935
We're losing life support.

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:14.017
The temperature is dropping rapidly.

01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:17.695
Atmosphere is venting from everywhere,
and I don't know how to stop it.

01:16:17.782 --> 01:16:19.614
Okay, how much time do we have?

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:24.445
In here? Two hours, maybe an hour 45...

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:26.370
But it...

01:16:26.457 --> 01:16:27.823
- What?
- Fuck.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:31.160
- Fuck!
- What? What is it? What?

01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:32.790
We're...

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:36.252
We're not moving into space. The opposite.

01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:39.335
All that fucked-up thrusting,
we're decaying again.

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:40.760
What?

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:44.635
Sho has a subroutine here.

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:52.849
Without any correction in course,
which we don't have any fuel for anyway...

01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:57.068
We'll hit the atmosphere in

01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:01.356
39 minutes.

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:15.836
We're not gonna survive reentry.

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:25.046
Calvin could.

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:12.928
It's so cold.

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:40.668
My father used to read this to me
when I was a kid.

01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:48.464
"Good night, room.

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:53.302
"Good night, moon.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.223
"Good night cow jumping over the moon.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.527
"Good night, light.

01:19:03.614 --> 01:19:05.401
"And the red balloon.

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:14.998
"Good night, nobody."

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:44.853
I remember when I saw
my first picture of Earth.

01:19:46.865 --> 01:19:49.949
And I asked my father where all those...

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:52.198
All those lines were.

01:19:53.747 --> 01:19:55.204
The borders.

01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:02.162
I really miss him.

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:24.275
Good night, moon.

01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:28.438
Good night, stars.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:31.737
Good night, air.

01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:38.786
Good night, air.

01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:43.745
Bait.

01:20:44.882 --> 01:20:47.340
Calvin needs oxygen to survive.

01:20:47.426 --> 01:20:49.383
With the O2 levels so low
in the rest of the ship,

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:51.086
it will be drawn to the oxygen candles.

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.887
- We can use them as bait.
- Yeah.

01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:56.011
There are two lifeboats, A and B,

01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:58.972
both set to default entry trajectory.

01:21:00.105 --> 01:21:03.769
You press the button,
they autopilot themselves to the surface,

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.522
unless somebody...

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:08.729
Somebody overrides them from the inside.

01:21:08.989 --> 01:21:13.484
I use the oxygen candles
to lure Calvin into Boat A.

01:21:13.577 --> 01:21:17.287
I close the hatch. I press the button
to give me full manual control.

01:21:17.998 --> 01:21:20.786
And if I can hold the stick,
I can override the flight path.

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:22.538
And if I hold it long enough,

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.207
I can avoid reentry.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:28.127
You fly out into deep space.

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:30.504
With Calvin. Yes.

01:21:30.677 --> 01:21:33.841
Meanwhile, you get into Boat B,

01:21:33.931 --> 01:21:36.298
you press the button,
and if there are no complications,

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:38.008
- then it'd take you back home.
- No.

01:21:38.102 --> 01:21:39.809
No, we should lure Calvin together.

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:41.431
- No, Miranda.
- Yeah.

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:43.396
That doesn't make any sense.

01:21:43.607 --> 01:21:44.814
Why?

01:21:45.109 --> 01:21:47.522
The lifeboats are meant for one person.

01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:51.150
And this has been your plan all along.

01:21:51.698 --> 01:21:54.441
To make sure that,
that creature doesn't get to Earth.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:56.906
Then I should be Plan A.

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:58.486
No, I'm a pilot.

01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:01.080
You're Plan B.

01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:03.833
Listen, listen.

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:06.453
I belong up here.

01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:15.967
I don't want to go back down
to eight billion of those motherfuckers.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:22.389
I need you to say you trust me.

01:22:24.314 --> 01:22:25.771
Yeah?

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:34.397
I do.

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:37.901
I trust you.

01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:44.536
Wait here. I'll signal you.

01:24:37.531 --> 01:24:39.238
Hey! Shit!

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.166
Shit!

01:25:41.887 --> 01:25:43.048
Fuck.

01:26:58.213 --> 01:26:59.203
Okay.

01:27:02.968 --> 01:27:04.925
This is Mission Specialist
Dr. David A. Jordan

01:27:05.011 --> 01:27:09.176
commanding Soyuz Lifeboat A, 2233 UTC.

01:27:09.266 --> 01:27:13.010
ISS has entered catastrophic orbital decay.

01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:16.562
Initiating emergency escape sequence in five,

01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:18.685
four, three,

01:27:19.151 --> 01:27:21.143
two, one.

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:02.267
Come on, Miranda, get going.

01:28:18.585 --> 01:28:20.201
Initiating manual override.

01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:50.652
This is Dr. Miranda North,

01:28:50.742 --> 01:28:53.951
black box recording
in case of death upon reentry.

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:57.698
The creature killed
four of the six ISS astronauts,

01:28:57.791 --> 01:28:59.999
with a fifth, Dr. David Jordan,

01:29:00.085 --> 01:29:02.702
presumed dead,
carrying it out into deep space.

01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:09.008
My five colleagues all sacrificed themselves
to maintain the firewall, so, please,

01:29:09.094 --> 01:29:12.383
honor them
for giving everything to this cause.

01:29:13.431 --> 01:29:16.344
Mars life-forms should be considered hostile.

01:29:16.434 --> 01:29:20.018
Do not underestimate their intelligence
and their adaptive capabilities.

01:29:21.481 --> 01:29:24.189
Now, we did not learn
how to restrain or eliminate it,

01:29:24.276 --> 01:29:26.689
but if this creature ever reaches Earth,

01:29:26.778 --> 01:29:29.862
use every available resource to destroy it,

01:29:29.948 --> 01:29:32.281
or you will risk all human life.

01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:44.997
You can do it. You can do it.

01:31:45.083 --> 01:31:46.540
You can do it.

01:31:46.626 --> 01:31:47.616
Come on!

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:34.641
No, no, no. No!

01:33:35.401 --> 01:33:38.235
No! No!

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:40.070
No!

01:33:40.365 --> 01:33:41.776
No!

01:33:41.866 --> 01:33:42.902
No!

01:33:44.369 --> 01:33:45.359
No! No!

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:49.618
No! No!

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:54.373
No! No!

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:56.870
No!

01:33:57.173 --> 01:33:58.664
No, no, no!

01:33:59.551 --> 01:34:00.587
No, no, no, no!
