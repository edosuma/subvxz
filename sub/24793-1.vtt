00:21.804 --> 00:23.414
[music playing]

00:28.289 --> 00:29.203
Not that you know of?

00:29.290 --> 00:30.117
Oh, great.

00:30.204 --> 00:31.683
That's very good.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.337
Steve, you know that
I have trust issues.

00:33.424 --> 00:36.514
And this bitch is trying
to fuck my husband.

00:36.601 --> 00:39.126
So forgive me for being upset
and wanting to talk about it.

00:39.213 --> 00:40.301
You don't talk about it though.

00:40.388 --> 00:42.129
You obsess about it.

00:42.216 --> 00:43.913
I am fucking sure.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.787
He held me down, and
he fucking raped me.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.702
It is my past.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.791
I can't change it.

00:52.878 --> 00:54.141
Why are you so jealous?

00:54.228 --> 00:55.881
I am not jealous.

00:55.968 --> 01:01.017
You just reminded me
that I was arrested.

01:01.104 --> 01:02.149
Fuck outta my house!

01:02.236 --> 01:04.150
Both of you need to stop.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.631
Both of you just stop it!

01:06.718 --> 01:09.939
But Reese knows that you
and Mike are best friends.

01:10.026 --> 01:10.940
Did you fuck her?

01:11.027 --> 01:12.333
Oh, my God.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.204
I fucking knew you'd
go there again.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.945
Then why did you bring it up?

01:16.032 --> 01:17.381
Because I clearly need
my fucking head examined.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.253
Yeah, you do.

01:19.340 --> 01:22.865
I am not losing another job
because of your paranoia.

01:22.952 --> 01:23.518
Help!

01:23.605 --> 01:24.171
Help!

01:24.258 --> 01:24.997
Help!

01:25.085 --> 01:25.868
That's enough!

01:25.955 --> 01:26.825
Shut up!

01:26.912 --> 01:27.826
Fuck you!

01:27.913 --> 01:28.827
Get out of here!

01:28.914 --> 01:31.787
I don't believe you!

01:31.874 --> 01:36.705
[shouting]

01:36.792 --> 01:37.793
Stop it!

01:37.880 --> 01:39.490
Get the fuck out my house!

01:39.577 --> 01:41.492
Knock that shit off!

01:41.579 --> 01:43.059
I can't defend myself.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.629
Get off, get off!

01:47.716 --> 01:48.412
[gunshot]

01:48.499 --> 01:51.589
[music playing]

02:04.385 --> 02:07.605
OK, I know you've been sworn.

02:07.692 --> 02:10.217
I have read your statements.

02:10.304 --> 02:14.873
Isn't it true that during the
course of this study, the three

02:14.960 --> 02:19.574
subject couples exhibited
increased levels of hostility?

02:19.661 --> 02:21.924
Yes, we did notice
an increased pattern

02:22.011 --> 02:22.968
of increased aggression.

02:23.055 --> 02:24.666
But if I must...

02:24.753 --> 02:27.103
And yet you thought that
was prudent and necessary

02:27.190 --> 02:28.887
to continue?

02:28.974 --> 02:32.239
We considered the risk
within an acceptable range.

02:32.326 --> 02:35.503
An acceptable range?

02:35.590 --> 02:37.287
Someone was murdered.

02:37.374 --> 02:40.464
Where does your
unacceptable rage begin?

02:40.551 --> 02:42.945
Excuse me, but I
think it bears noting

02:43.032 --> 02:45.730
that all three of these couples
were dealing with some very

02:45.817 --> 02:48.777
serious stability issues.

02:48.864 --> 02:51.519
Violence is a common
occurrence in these types

02:51.606 --> 02:53.260
of relationships.

02:53.347 --> 02:57.264
Our duty is simply to
observe and document, not

02:57.351 --> 02:59.309
make judgments as to
whether the side effects

02:59.396 --> 03:01.311
outweigh the possible benefits.

03:01.398 --> 03:04.445
How do you determine if a drug
is doing more harm than good?

03:08.013 --> 03:11.234
At this point, I would like
to defer to Dr. Baxter.

03:11.321 --> 03:14.063
Sure, let's hear
from the good doctor.

03:14.150 --> 03:16.544
Clearly, people suffering
from mental illness

03:16.631 --> 03:19.068
have a higher incidence
of aggressive behavior

03:19.155 --> 03:20.852
than the general public.

03:20.939 --> 03:23.725
They may try to harm others,
themselves, including

03:23.812 --> 03:25.335
hospital healthcare
workers trying

03:25.422 --> 03:26.902
to provide care for them.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.296
Now our studies have
commonly reported

03:29.383 --> 03:31.167
that a small
subgroup of patients

03:31.254 --> 03:34.388
were responsible for the
majority of these incidents.

03:34.475 --> 03:37.695
Doctor, what subgroups?

03:37.782 --> 03:41.133
Primarily people in volatile
domestic relationships.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.963
So when you look at results
for this kind of study,

03:45.050 --> 03:47.749
you would take that
into consideration?

03:47.836 --> 03:49.359
Correct.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.535
Even though there are
incidents of aggression,

03:51.622 --> 03:53.320
when you adjust for
the overall numbers,

03:53.407 --> 03:55.800
we actually see improvement.

03:55.887 --> 03:58.412
Would you be able
to discern something

03:58.499 --> 04:01.850
like this during the trial?

04:01.937 --> 04:03.373
No.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.288
In fact, it would
take several studies

04:05.375 --> 04:07.638
involving hundreds of patients
before we could even make

04:07.725 --> 04:09.336
that kind of determination.

04:09.423 --> 04:10.989
I have a question.

04:11.076 --> 04:13.209
What were the possible
benefits of this drug?

04:13.296 --> 04:16.298
We were contracted by Darba
to do pharmacological testing

04:16.386 --> 04:19.694
on a chiral compound designed
to aid in conflict resolution

04:19.781 --> 04:22.043
by altering the
sensory experience.

04:22.130 --> 04:24.176
Give a person keen
personal insights

04:24.264 --> 04:27.571
by allowing them to look
past preconceived ideas

04:27.658 --> 04:29.660
and prejudices.

04:29.747 --> 04:32.446
Isn't that the same as LSD?

04:32.533 --> 04:33.969
No!

04:34.056 --> 04:36.885
Ours was not synthesized
through a fungus.

04:36.972 --> 04:39.409
Instead, it was synthesized
through stem cells

04:39.496 --> 04:42.673
of the empathetic
bonobo chimpanzee.

04:42.760 --> 04:47.417
Based on early tests of the more
violent African chimpanzees,

04:47.504 --> 04:49.201
we believed that
this new compound

04:49.289 --> 04:52.640
could have had far-reaching
outcomes for everyone,

04:52.727 --> 04:54.772
from individuals with
post-traumatic stress

04:54.859 --> 04:59.299
disorders to helping solve
geopolitical conflicts

04:59.386 --> 05:00.735
around the world.

05:00.822 --> 05:04.608
So in layman's terms,
you all thought

05:04.695 --> 05:09.265
you had a drug on your hands
that would end hostility

05:09.352 --> 05:11.093
around the globe?

05:11.180 --> 05:12.660
Yes.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.575
We'd sorted through
thousands of applicants

05:14.662 --> 05:17.012
and found these three couples
that matched our criteria.

05:17.099 --> 05:20.494
Their relationships were
being torn apart by conflict.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.104
And you tested it
by giving drugs

05:22.191 --> 05:24.236
to people that made
them more hostile.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.417
Let's go for it.

05:30.504 --> 05:35.335
The easiest way to say it is
there are issues about her past

05:35.422 --> 05:36.858
that affect our relationship.

05:36.945 --> 05:40.949
Basically what she used
to do for a living.

05:41.036 --> 05:44.605
Lorie's great.

05:44.692 --> 05:45.910
She's smart.

05:45.997 --> 05:46.868
She's funny.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.217
She makes me laugh.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.654
She's got a great heart.

05:50.741 --> 05:53.744
And usually, we get along great.

05:53.831 --> 06:01.317
But sooner or
later, it comes up.

06:01.404 --> 06:03.754
And we end up fighting about it.

06:03.841 --> 06:05.495
I get so pissed sometimes.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.932
Because everything is going
along so great, and then

06:08.019 --> 06:10.805
Andrew just finds a way
to throw it in my face.

06:10.892 --> 06:15.462
Lorie thinks that I'm jealous
about the men in her past.

06:15.549 --> 06:18.378
Trust me, I'm not
jealous in the least.

06:20.815 --> 06:22.512
I think that she's the
one with the issue.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.035
And she's just
not addressing it.

06:26.342 --> 06:29.693
I just want to know
that I'm not crazy.

06:29.780 --> 06:33.958
And I want Andrew to start
to deal with his hangups.

06:34.045 --> 06:36.221
And if there's something
that I need to deal with,

06:36.308 --> 06:37.788
I'm fine with that.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.399
I just want to know what
it is and figure it out,

06:39.486 --> 06:41.836
so that we can just get
past this and move on.

06:41.923 --> 06:46.014
I guess what I want
out of this is clarity.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.410
There's something going
on in our relationship

06:50.497 --> 06:53.064
that I'm just not seeing.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.858
So why didn't you take the deal?

07:03.945 --> 07:06.817
Well, technically, since
he spent the night in jail,

07:06.904 --> 07:08.428
it's a priorable offense.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.389
What does that mean?

07:13.476 --> 07:16.827
Well, when you're arrested, if
you spend the night in jail,

07:16.914 --> 07:20.091
the court will consider
that time served.

07:20.178 --> 07:23.051
In other words, a jail sentence
if you're ever convicted,

07:23.138 --> 07:26.576
which means if you're
arrested and convicted again,

07:26.663 --> 07:30.145
then it will be a
mandatory jail sentence.

07:30.232 --> 07:32.452
You mean like my
solicitation charge?

07:35.498 --> 07:36.499
OK.

07:36.586 --> 07:37.674
Yeah, sure, as an example.

07:37.761 --> 07:40.372
You spent two nights in jail?

07:40.460 --> 07:43.463
So if you're arrested
and convicted again,

07:43.550 --> 07:45.377
you will do jail time.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.728
OK, well, that's not
going to happen again.

07:47.815 --> 07:49.556
So why did you have
to bring it up?

07:49.643 --> 07:51.166
I was just answering
your question.

07:51.253 --> 07:54.517
Why did you have to use
my case as an example?

07:54.604 --> 07:57.564
I didn't, you did.

07:57.651 --> 08:00.088
Andrew, are you kidding me?

08:00.175 --> 08:01.176
You just did.

08:01.263 --> 08:04.092
Lorie, I know what I said.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.703
So do I.

08:06.790 --> 08:11.099
Trust me, OK, I listen
to people's testimonies

08:11.186 --> 08:12.100
for a living.

08:12.187 --> 08:14.755
I think I would know.

08:14.842 --> 08:18.585
And I'm just a whore,
so I'm an idiot?

08:18.672 --> 08:21.152
I didn't call you
an idiot or a whore.

08:21.239 --> 08:25.592
You just reminded me that I
was arrested for solicitation.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.289
So that makes me a whore.

08:27.376 --> 08:29.291
And apparently, I can't
have a simple conversation

08:29.378 --> 08:32.120
without forgetting what I say,
so that makes me an idiot.

08:32.207 --> 08:35.558
First of all, the two things
are mutually exclusive.

08:35.645 --> 08:36.385
Secondly...

08:36.472 --> 08:39.475
Don't do that.

08:39.562 --> 08:40.780
You know I don't
know legal terms.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.522
Why are you doing that?

08:42.609 --> 08:43.957
What, mutually exclusive?

08:44.044 --> 08:44.959
Yeah.

08:45.046 --> 08:46.351
It's not a legal term.

08:46.438 --> 08:47.527
Well, I don't know
what it means.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.967
You don't know what
mutually exclusive means?

08:53.054 --> 08:56.623
Lorie, just think
about it for a seconds.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.060
Mutually exclusive.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.757
Don't be condescending, Andrew.

09:00.844 --> 09:03.630
How am I being
condescending right now?

09:03.717 --> 09:04.413
Fuck you.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.240
That's how.

09:14.510 --> 09:18.470
So what was your initial
professional assessment

09:18.558 --> 09:20.342
after watching that footage.

09:20.429 --> 09:23.127
The couple indicated to us
that this type of hostility

09:23.214 --> 09:24.694
was common.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.740
At this point, we didn't
see any cause for alarm.

09:26.827 --> 09:29.612
But it escalated, didn't it?

09:29.699 --> 09:30.482
It did.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.180
How much?

09:32.267 --> 09:33.964
Significantly.

09:34.051 --> 09:35.662
What about Emily and Beth?

09:35.749 --> 09:37.838
Did they ever indicate
that there was ever

09:37.925 --> 09:39.274
any violence between them?

09:39.361 --> 09:41.624
No, there was
never any violence.

09:41.711 --> 09:45.106
Beth and I have been together
for about two years now.

09:45.193 --> 09:48.631
And until recently, things
have been wonderful.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.415
Emily is the love of my life.

09:50.502 --> 09:53.767
Before this thing happened,
well, she was the one

09:53.854 --> 09:55.420
that I was going to marry.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.858
We were at a party at
Emily's boss's house.

09:57.945 --> 10:00.687
I noticed Beth was being
a little bit friendlier,

10:00.774 --> 10:03.037
some might say
flirty, with Justin.

10:03.124 --> 10:06.736
And to be honest, it did
bother me a little bit.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.390
Beth says she's not
attracted to men.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.958
But I'm not so sure.

10:11.045 --> 10:14.962
I find men attractive,
just not sexually.

10:17.268 --> 10:18.879
I had a boyfriend before.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.011
Because I thought it was
what I was supposed to do.

10:23.971 --> 10:26.582
I think she secretly
thinks I'm craving cock.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.149
Excuse my expression.

10:28.236 --> 10:30.238
You're going to have
to give me time, OK?

10:30.325 --> 10:33.589
I need to work things
out with Beth first.

10:33.676 --> 10:34.764
I love you too.

10:34.851 --> 10:37.637
But she's going to be my wife.

10:37.724 --> 10:38.768
Look, I got to go.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.422
I'll talk to you later, OK?

10:40.509 --> 10:42.511
OK, bye.

10:42.598 --> 10:43.599
Who was that?

10:43.686 --> 10:46.428
Work.

10:46.515 --> 10:47.864
What?

10:47.951 --> 10:49.866
Well, either you
love someone at work,

10:49.953 --> 10:52.260
which we should probably talk
about, or you just lied to me.

10:52.347 --> 10:54.175
I didn't want to start
a fight with you.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.785
Justin.

10:55.872 --> 10:56.960
He called me.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.309
What was I supposed to do?

10:58.396 --> 10:59.441
I don't know.

10:59.528 --> 11:00.964
Maybe tell him to fuck off.

11:01.051 --> 11:02.313
See, this is why I
didn't want to tell you.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.314
Just tell him to
stop calling here.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.273
I did.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.188
Well, obviously, your brother
doesn't understand the words no

11:07.275 --> 11:08.319
and stop.

11:08.406 --> 11:10.191
What do you want from me, Beth?

11:10.278 --> 11:12.367
Just the minimum under the
circumstances would be nice.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.238
I'm trying.

11:14.325 --> 11:18.678
It hurts that she
doesn't fully believe me.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.592
I mean, I know it's her brother.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.681
But...

11:21.768 --> 11:22.464
I know him.

11:25.859 --> 11:29.863
I just can't picture him doing
something like that ever.

11:29.950 --> 11:33.170
I just want Emily to believe me.

11:33.257 --> 11:39.394
Without out, I don't see
how there can be an us.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.526
What about the
last two subjects?

11:41.613 --> 11:46.357
What was their history, in
terms of violent behavior?

11:46.444 --> 11:48.577
Our last two
subjects... the first

11:48.664 --> 11:50.884
is Steve, works in
the TV film industry,

11:50.971 --> 11:52.494
and his wife,
Christina, unemployed.

11:52.581 --> 11:54.801
There was no history of
any physical episodes.

11:54.888 --> 11:58.805
But we did feel that there was
evidence of a very emotionally

11:58.892 --> 12:01.938
volatile relationship.

12:02.025 --> 12:07.857
I've been really
emotional these days.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.641
Steve and I are having
a lot of problems.

12:13.210 --> 12:15.865
I really feel like he
wants to divorce me.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.999
Kristina has become
so insecure about me

12:19.086 --> 12:22.263
wanting to leave that she's
making me want to leave.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.744
I know in my heart that Steve
would never cheated on me.

12:27.311 --> 12:28.748
But whenever he's away...

12:31.620 --> 12:32.490
I don't know.

12:32.577 --> 12:34.188
I just I can't help it.

12:34.275 --> 12:36.277
At this point, I'm willing
to do whatever it takes.

12:36.364 --> 12:39.193
I mean, we've tried
couple's therapy,

12:39.280 --> 12:41.282
hypnosis, self-help books.

12:44.372 --> 12:47.331
This might be our
last opportunity.

12:47.418 --> 12:49.029
And I really hope it helps.

12:53.337 --> 12:58.081
If this doesn't work, I
don't know what I'll do.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.044
I can't imagine
living without him.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.577
Where the fuck have you been?

13:15.664 --> 13:17.840
Kristina, I told you last
week I'll be working late.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.537
I even called and asked you.

13:19.624 --> 13:21.539
And you said it
wouldn't be a problem.

13:21.626 --> 13:23.759
Well, you could have at least
fucking picked up your phone.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.065
I was working, editing.

13:25.152 --> 13:26.066
Yeah, editing.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.458
He's fucking editing.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.591
I'll call Mark, and
he can tell you.

13:29.678 --> 13:30.418
Stop it.

13:30.505 --> 13:31.027
Don't do that.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.420
Why not?

13:32.507 --> 13:34.770
Because then I'm
just the crazy wife

13:34.857 --> 13:36.728
that doesn't trust her husband.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.730
No, I'll call him and I'll put
it on speaker, and you can...

13:38.818 --> 13:39.906
He's not stupid.

13:39.993 --> 13:40.732
He'll know what you're doing.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.430
Just stop.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.301
Baby, I'm under so
much pressure right now

13:44.388 --> 13:45.259
to meet this deadline.

13:45.346 --> 13:46.521
You have no idea.

13:46.608 --> 13:51.091
I know, OK.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.179
I'm sorry.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.750
I do remember you telling
me about being in editing

13:58.838 --> 14:01.449
this week.

14:01.536 --> 14:03.364
You do?

14:03.451 --> 14:04.539
I'm sorry.

14:04.626 --> 14:05.540
You have a brain like a sieve.

14:10.284 --> 14:12.155
Should I cancel tomorrow night?

14:12.242 --> 14:15.158
What's tomorrow night?

14:15.245 --> 14:16.943
You forgot about tomorrow night?

14:17.030 --> 14:19.815
What's tomorrow night?

14:19.902 --> 14:20.947
Mike and Reese.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.078
It's been planned for weeks.

14:22.165 --> 14:22.862
No, I remember.

14:22.949 --> 14:23.775
I remember.

14:23.863 --> 14:24.951
Come on, I just...

14:25.038 --> 14:25.560
I'm going to go grab a shower.

14:25.647 --> 14:26.430
Steve.

14:26.517 --> 14:27.388
[sighs]

14:43.839 --> 14:45.362
Hey, Reese.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.843
Hey, yeah, I just want
to make sure we're still

14:47.930 --> 14:50.846
on for tomorrow night.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.761
Yeah.

14:52.848 --> 14:58.245
OK, sorry, where did we say
that we were meeting again?

14:58.332 --> 15:00.464
Right, The Cantina.

15:00.551 --> 15:05.905
OK, well, I'll just see
you tomorrow night then.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.254
All right, I'll see you then.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.350
Did you disclose
to the couples what

15:16.437 --> 15:18.439
this drug was supposed to do?

15:18.526 --> 15:19.875
Yes.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.659
We did a full
work-up on everyone.

15:21.746 --> 15:24.053
And we disclosed all
the relevant information

15:24.140 --> 15:25.402
that we deemed necessary.

15:25.489 --> 15:28.797
That you deemed necessary.

15:28.884 --> 15:31.017
So you didn't get a
fully-informed consent

15:31.104 --> 15:32.627
from the participants
of your study,

15:32.714 --> 15:35.499
and they went in blind
to the side effects

15:35.586 --> 15:37.719
they were possibly exposed to.

15:37.806 --> 15:40.722
Meaning, if they had any known
psychological issues that

15:40.809 --> 15:42.506
would be negatively
affected by this drug,

15:42.593 --> 15:44.856
they wouldn't necessarily
disclose that to you.

15:44.944 --> 15:49.339
So that you could then
intervene and prohibit

15:49.426 --> 15:51.733
what was happening
right under your nose.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.648
No, sir.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.911
None of the participants had
any known psychological issues!

15:55.998 --> 15:57.217
No, you mean diagnosed.

15:57.304 --> 16:01.569
Yeah, what about undiagnosed?

16:01.656 --> 16:04.354
Thank you.

16:04.441 --> 16:09.011
Some of these medical
questions are way too personal.

16:09.098 --> 16:12.449
Oh, you mean, like sexually
transmitted diseases?

16:12.536 --> 16:14.060
Exactly.

16:14.147 --> 16:15.148
Like someone's really
going to write down,

16:15.235 --> 16:16.671
yeah, I had the clap once.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.542
It's actually for
liability purposes.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.414
That way if you don't
disclose something now,

16:20.501 --> 16:22.416
if there are
complications later,

16:22.503 --> 16:25.245
then the company won't
be held liable for it.

16:25.332 --> 16:26.986
Just because they
asked us the question.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.075
What exactly is this drug
supposed to do again?

16:29.162 --> 16:31.947
It's supposed to give you
insight into thinking to see

16:32.034 --> 16:34.341
where you have misconceptions.

16:34.428 --> 16:37.083
They should just
legalize shrooms.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.519
It's funny that you say that.

16:38.606 --> 16:39.868
The government's
actually been testing

16:39.955 --> 16:41.522
different types
of hallucinogenics

16:41.609 --> 16:43.741
and other psychotropic
substances for years.

16:43.828 --> 16:44.742
A.k.a.

16:44.829 --> 16:45.917
drugs.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.528
You can just say drugs, honey.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.269
Because I don't think
anybody understands.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.619
Well, I was speaking about
specific drugs, honey.

16:51.706 --> 16:54.100
They've been trying
to utilize some

16:54.187 --> 16:56.102
of the therapeutic
benefits instead

16:56.189 --> 16:58.800
of the mind-altering aspects.

16:58.887 --> 17:02.760
In other words, taking
all the fun out of it.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.980
You know, I actually heard
that they're supposed

17:05.067 --> 17:06.460
to inject you in the eye.

17:06.547 --> 17:07.461
What?

17:07.548 --> 17:08.375
No, that's not true.

17:08.462 --> 17:09.723
No, I heard that.

17:09.810 --> 17:11.247
Yeah, she knows.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.815
I doubt that very serious.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.164
OK, but it's what I heard.

17:15.251 --> 17:15.772
OK.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.780
The compound's called
diethylphenyl tryptavine,

17:22.867 --> 17:24.521
also known as DPT.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.828
You'll be the first
clinical patients to try it.

17:26.915 --> 17:28.656
And as I mentioned
before, it's critical

17:28.743 --> 17:30.919
that you post your
video diaries daily.

17:31.006 --> 17:34.401
It will let us know any changes
you might be experiencing.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.185
Here you go, doctor.

17:36.272 --> 17:39.319
Thank you.

17:39.406 --> 17:41.799
So just put your
hand forward, please.

17:41.886 --> 17:45.499
Wait, you're not actually
going to stick that in my eye?

17:45.586 --> 17:48.197
No, we're going
around the eyeball

17:48.284 --> 17:49.590
into the lacrimal gland.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.768
What does that mean?

17:53.855 --> 17:55.465
Oh, that means that
she's going to stick that

17:55.552 --> 17:56.771
straight to your brain, man.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.429
Is he serious?

18:02.516 --> 18:04.518
Yes, but you really
don't have to worry.

18:04.605 --> 18:05.997
You're not going
to feel anything.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.348
Well, unless, you
know, she misses.

18:08.435 --> 18:11.525
Well, then, the worst
headache ever, man.

18:15.529 --> 18:16.530
Look, don't worry.

18:16.617 --> 18:17.487
I'm just kidding.

18:17.574 --> 18:18.662
She never misses.

18:18.749 --> 18:19.663
Trust me.

18:19.750 --> 18:20.882
Baby, don't be a wuss.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.405
Come on.

18:22.492 --> 18:23.972
You do realize
you're next, right?

18:34.548 --> 18:37.072
How long before it takes effect?

18:37.159 --> 18:38.726
It depends.

18:38.813 --> 18:39.466
I'm sorry.

18:39.553 --> 18:40.119
I'm sorry.

18:40.206 --> 18:40.815
Sorry.

18:40.902 --> 18:41.598
I'm here.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.861
Hi.

18:43.948 --> 18:44.688
I'm sorry.

18:44.775 --> 18:45.428
I'm sorry.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.038
I'm sorry.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.997
Larger doses will take
effect more quickly.

18:49.084 --> 18:51.304
But we're giving each of the
subjects in the study varying

18:51.391 --> 18:52.740
doses.

18:52.827 --> 18:53.915
That won't be revealed
until afterward.

18:54.002 --> 18:54.916
Put your head forward, please.

18:55.003 --> 18:55.917
Is that going in my eye?

18:56.004 --> 18:59.007
All the way forward.

18:59.094 --> 19:00.748
Will this help with her memory?

19:00.835 --> 19:02.532
How do you mean?

19:02.619 --> 19:03.620
Well, sometimes she forgets
things I've told her.

19:03.707 --> 19:06.232
It's like she doesn't remember.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.016
You know what I mean?

19:08.103 --> 19:10.323
Well, if she's subconsciously
blocking things out,

19:10.410 --> 19:12.238
then yes, this should help.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.370
That's great, right, babe?

19:14.457 --> 19:17.417
Yeah, it's great.

19:17.504 --> 19:18.244
So are we done here?

19:18.331 --> 19:18.853
Mm-hmm.

19:21.986 --> 19:22.857
Thank you so much.

19:28.993 --> 19:33.955
Andrew and I just had a fight
about the same old shit.

19:34.042 --> 19:40.875
And I just want to know that
whoever watches this video,

19:40.962 --> 19:43.182
tell him that he's the one
who brings the shit up.

19:48.099 --> 19:51.015
Ugh, long day.

19:51.102 --> 19:53.235
Oh, sorry.

19:53.322 --> 19:54.976
What are you watching?

19:55.063 --> 19:55.933
Breaking Bad.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.805
You want to join me?

19:57.892 --> 19:59.285
No.

19:59.372 --> 20:00.677
You know what?

20:00.764 --> 20:02.636
I want to start
from the beginning.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.855
Everyone's been telling
me how good this show is.

20:04.942 --> 20:05.639
So intense.

20:05.726 --> 20:06.292
Yeah?

20:06.379 --> 20:07.945
Yeah.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.469
Why don't I find something
we can both watch.

20:09.556 --> 20:11.384
I think the Dodgers' game's on.

20:11.471 --> 20:12.515
OK.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.256
I was thinking about porn, but...

20:14.343 --> 20:16.476
Fuck the Dodgers.

20:16.563 --> 20:17.955
You have porn on this thing?

20:18.042 --> 20:18.739
I do.

20:18.826 --> 20:19.914
What do you got?

20:20.001 --> 20:23.657
I have a really hot threesome.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.963
Ooh, two girls and a guy?

20:26.050 --> 20:26.921
Fuck that.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.183
Two guys and a girl.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.880
No, I don't think so.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.795
What else you got?

20:31.882 --> 20:34.798
So you're not going to bring
home one of your hot friends

20:34.885 --> 20:36.060
for us?

20:36.147 --> 20:38.324
Uh, no.

20:38.411 --> 20:40.064
I don't think that's
going to happen.

20:40.151 --> 20:41.327
Don't get your hopes up.

20:41.414 --> 20:42.937
You suck.

20:43.024 --> 20:49.291
OK, I have a pretty
steamy lesbian scene.

20:49.378 --> 20:50.466
No.

20:50.553 --> 20:51.815
I can't watch a lesbian scene.

20:51.902 --> 20:53.513
Every time I watch
a lesbian scene,

20:53.600 --> 20:55.384
I feel like I'm
intruding on them.

20:55.471 --> 20:56.342
What else?

20:56.429 --> 20:58.082
I don't think they mind.

20:58.169 --> 21:00.476
What about school girls?

21:00.563 --> 21:01.999
I have that.

21:02.086 --> 21:02.609
I do.

21:02.696 --> 21:03.218
You do?

21:03.305 --> 21:03.914
Mm-hmm.

21:04.001 --> 21:05.394
Let's see.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.788
You know I like them young.

21:07.875 --> 21:08.789
You do?

21:08.876 --> 21:09.877
I mean, you're young.

21:09.964 --> 21:10.834
I am, right?

21:10.921 --> 21:12.880
Enough.

21:12.967 --> 21:16.318
It's why we're watching
porn though, right?

21:16.405 --> 21:17.972
OK, go.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.366
I'm gonna lay down on
the ground on my back.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.368
You know what?

21:22.455 --> 21:24.544
Let's just get past this part.

21:24.631 --> 21:26.459
Oh, you know it?

21:26.546 --> 21:28.417
I just want to get past that
talking and all that stuff.

21:28.504 --> 21:29.418
OK.

21:29.505 --> 21:32.073
[tape fast-forwarding]

21:32.160 --> 21:33.509
There.

21:33.596 --> 21:36.382
Now it's starting.

21:36.469 --> 21:37.731
Oh, girl.

21:37.818 --> 21:39.167
Come on.

21:39.254 --> 21:40.560
Nice.

21:40.647 --> 21:41.735
[moaning]

21:45.608 --> 21:46.522
You like that?

21:46.609 --> 21:47.349
Uh-huh.

21:47.436 --> 21:48.307
You like that?

21:48.394 --> 21:52.136
[passionate moaning]

21:52.223 --> 21:54.530
Ooh, yeah.

21:54.617 --> 21:56.140
[panting]

22:09.197 --> 22:11.678
[music playing]

23:41.028 --> 23:44.423
You know, with my
last girlfriend,

23:44.510 --> 23:47.861
I had to watch porn in the
bathroom on the laptop.

23:47.948 --> 23:49.515
Why?

23:49.602 --> 23:53.388
She said that it
exploited women.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.956
I hate people like that.

23:56.043 --> 23:58.306
Like those chicks
don't have a choice.

23:58.393 --> 23:59.829
I know, right?

23:59.916 --> 24:01.527
She's actually the
one insulting women.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.703
Because if we're getting
paid well for what we do,

24:03.790 --> 24:06.096
how is that exploitation?

24:06.183 --> 24:07.663
Well, maybe some
of them are forced

24:07.750 --> 24:10.536
into it due to circumstances.

24:10.623 --> 24:11.928
Nobody put a gun to my head.

24:15.105 --> 24:19.936
I think what she means is
that some of these women

24:20.023 --> 24:21.938
are put in situations
that they normally

24:22.025 --> 24:23.331
wouldn't want to be in.

24:26.334 --> 24:29.729
Would you show up
for work tomorrow

24:29.816 --> 24:30.991
if they weren't paying you?

24:33.646 --> 24:34.951
Probably not.

24:35.038 --> 24:37.998
But I don't fuck
people for a living.

24:38.085 --> 24:41.175
But you're a lawyer, right?

24:41.262 --> 24:42.524
Very funny.

24:42.611 --> 24:43.917
Don't worry.

24:44.004 --> 24:46.093
I'm giving you a
discount tonight.

24:53.883 --> 24:55.537
I was joking.

24:55.624 --> 24:58.758
OK, but it's not funny.

24:58.845 --> 25:02.152
You like that I'm into porn.

25:02.239 --> 25:05.112
But it bothers you that
I used to fuck for money?

25:05.199 --> 25:07.375
Yeah, I'm sorry.

25:07.462 --> 25:09.551
Maybe if you had a little
respect for yourself,

25:09.638 --> 25:11.553
it would bother you too.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.861
You are such a
fucking hypocrite.

25:14.948 --> 25:19.387
You can jerk off to people
that fuck for money,

25:19.474 --> 25:21.476
but you look down on me?

25:21.563 --> 25:23.434
I don't look down on you.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.349
I just prefer not to be reminded
how many men have been inside

25:25.436 --> 25:28.962
of you, especially after we
just finished making love.

25:29.049 --> 25:30.485
How many women
have you been with?

25:30.572 --> 25:32.095
I don't throw it in your face!

25:35.011 --> 25:38.362
And I'm talking about fucking
random assholes for money.

25:38.449 --> 25:41.627
I'm sorry if I can't stand
thinking about the woman I

25:41.714 --> 25:43.629
love doing that!

25:43.716 --> 25:45.674
I am sorry, OK?

25:45.761 --> 25:46.457
I'm sorry!

25:52.246 --> 25:53.987
With Andrew and
Lorie, the drug seem

25:54.074 --> 25:56.642
to be having a
protracted effect.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.600
Well, at the same
time, Emily and Beth

25:58.687 --> 26:00.515
both had a similar
type of conflict.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.952
But it seemed to be more
about the single incident that

26:03.039 --> 26:05.128
took place, rather than
with her brother, Justin.

26:05.215 --> 26:08.392
The drug seemed to be having
a more accelerated response.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.264
I think I feel the
effects of the DPT.

26:13.484 --> 26:19.578
I find myself being able to see
things a little more clearly.

26:23.146 --> 26:25.105
It could be in my
imagination though.

26:25.192 --> 26:29.892
I hope it's working though,
and I hope it's working firmly.

26:36.377 --> 26:37.247
[humming]

26:47.518 --> 26:49.999
Seem to have less
patience with people.

26:50.086 --> 26:52.567
I wonder if that's
a side effect.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.744
Must be, because I'm starting
to notice the same thing.

26:55.831 --> 26:57.659
Wish there was a way
we could test it to see

26:57.746 --> 27:01.010
if it had taken effect yet.

27:01.097 --> 27:04.579
Like that scene in True
Lies when Arnold is injected

27:04.666 --> 27:06.276
with the sodium pentothal.

27:06.363 --> 27:08.888
And his wife starts
asking all these questions

27:08.975 --> 27:11.717
she's always wanted to know.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.414
Yeah, but it's not
true serum, Beth.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.459
If it was, I'd ask what
you thought of the lasagna

27:15.546 --> 27:16.852
I made last week.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.375
Loved your lasagna,
babe, honestly.

27:18.462 --> 27:19.594
See?

27:19.681 --> 27:22.510
It is definitely
not truth serum.

27:22.597 --> 27:24.904
Wish there was such a
thing as a truth serum.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.471
You'd know I was
telling the truth.

27:27.558 --> 27:30.779
We're really going to
fucking do this right now?

27:30.866 --> 27:33.564
It'd be one thing if
I did something wrong.

27:33.652 --> 27:34.391
I told you, Beth.

27:34.478 --> 27:36.002
I believe you.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.830
If I didn't believe
you, I wouldn't still

27:37.917 --> 27:39.396
be with you after you cheated
on me with my brother.

27:39.483 --> 27:41.921
I cheated on you?

27:42.008 --> 27:43.923
I'm saying, if I
thought you were lying,

27:44.010 --> 27:46.099
that would mean that you would
have had to have cheated on me

27:46.186 --> 27:47.709
with my brother,
which you didn't.

27:47.796 --> 27:50.407
So I'm still with you.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.409
What about your brother?

27:52.496 --> 27:53.976
What about him?

27:54.063 --> 27:55.021
Whatever version,
mine or his, he still

27:55.108 --> 27:56.936
had sex with your fiance.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.415
In my version, he's a rapist.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.374
In his version,
he's just a scumbag.

28:00.461 --> 28:03.203
Either way, I'd think
you'd stop talking to him.

28:03.290 --> 28:05.466
I'm not happy with Justin, Beth.

28:05.553 --> 28:07.642
It's really complicated.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.252
He knows what he did was wrong.

28:09.339 --> 28:10.689
He knows that I'm pissed at him.

28:14.649 --> 28:17.957
You know, I believe that you
believe what you say happened.

28:18.044 --> 28:19.175
God damn it!

28:19.262 --> 28:20.742
See, here we go again.

28:20.829 --> 28:22.744
What you just said,
that's not believing me.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.790
I saw you, Beth.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.530
You were all over
him at the party.

28:26.617 --> 28:28.489
I wasn't all over him!

28:28.576 --> 28:30.012
But I just stuck close to him,
because I know how jealous your

28:30.099 --> 28:31.710
get when other guys talk to me.

28:31.797 --> 28:34.234
So I thought you'd feel
more comfortable about it

28:34.321 --> 28:36.671
because he's your
brother, for God's sakes.

28:36.758 --> 28:39.065
OK, whatever.

28:39.152 --> 28:40.762
What the fuck does that mean?

28:40.849 --> 28:42.895
Why did you go home with him?

28:42.982 --> 28:44.548
Because he said he
forgot his wallet,

28:44.635 --> 28:45.941
and he needed to get gas.

28:46.028 --> 28:47.813
Then why didn't you
wait in the car?

28:47.900 --> 28:49.162
It was 2:00 in the
morning, Emily,

28:49.249 --> 28:50.729
and I didn't know
he was a rapist.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.600
God damn it!

28:52.687 --> 28:53.732
Beth, you cannot throw the
word rape around unless you are

28:53.819 --> 28:55.516
absolutely sure.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.126
I am fucking sure.

28:57.213 --> 29:01.174
He held me down and
he fucking raped me.

29:01.261 --> 29:03.698
Are you really that sure?

29:03.785 --> 29:05.047
That's what I fucking thought.

29:13.708 --> 29:17.016
So both women began to
suspect that the DPT was

29:17.103 --> 29:19.018
causing them to be impatient.

29:19.105 --> 29:21.368
Yet you still weren't concerned.

29:21.455 --> 29:21.977
No.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.936
Why not?

29:24.023 --> 29:26.286
Because we knew that one of
the girls was given a placebo.

29:26.373 --> 29:28.244
Well, what about
the third couple?

29:28.331 --> 29:30.203
You mean Kristina and Steve?

29:30.290 --> 29:32.074
Yes.

29:32.161 --> 29:34.120
That couple has always had
problems with communication.

29:34.207 --> 29:37.950
Sometimes even I
think I'm crazy.

29:38.037 --> 29:41.214
I swear to God, it is
so obvious sometimes

29:41.301 --> 29:45.174
that Steve is cheating on me.

29:45.261 --> 29:46.741
I'm ready to fucking
shoot myself.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.743
I can't take this anymore.

29:48.830 --> 29:54.096
I love Kristina, but enough
with these fucking accusations.

29:54.183 --> 29:56.751
That bartender was pouring
those drinks really strong,

29:56.838 --> 29:57.665
wasn't he?

29:57.752 --> 29:58.492
Mm-hmm.

29:58.579 --> 29:59.319
You're drunk.

29:59.406 --> 30:00.320
You're tipsy.

30:00.407 --> 30:01.103
I like you like this.

30:01.190 --> 30:01.669
I'm feeling it.

30:07.675 --> 30:08.545
Oh, my God.

30:08.632 --> 30:12.549
Was it just me or...

30:12.636 --> 30:13.463
What?

30:13.550 --> 30:14.247
No, you know what?

30:14.334 --> 30:15.030
Never mind.

30:15.117 --> 30:15.814
Steve, that?

30:15.901 --> 30:16.727
It's silly.

30:16.815 --> 30:17.380
It's really silly.

30:17.467 --> 30:18.251
Steve.

30:18.338 --> 30:19.078
I don't want to upset you.

30:19.165 --> 30:20.122
It's been fun.

30:20.209 --> 30:21.123
Come on, Steve.

30:21.210 --> 30:22.168
Just tell me.

30:24.866 --> 30:30.089
I talk to him, and I feel like
maybe I'm just a bit paranoid.

30:33.353 --> 30:35.398
Then I promise myself
that I won't do it again.

30:39.185 --> 30:40.186
I don't know.

30:40.273 --> 30:41.187
Sooner or later, it just...

30:44.581 --> 30:47.236
I can't help it.

30:47.323 --> 30:50.892
Was it just me, or was Reese
flirting with me tonight?

30:50.979 --> 30:52.067
Oh, my God.

30:52.154 --> 30:53.112
I didn't want to say anything.

30:53.199 --> 30:54.417
So you noticed it too.

30:54.504 --> 30:55.549
Yeah.

30:55.636 --> 30:56.680
I thought I was going crazy.

30:56.767 --> 30:58.813
No, this time, you're right.

30:58.900 --> 30:59.945
I felt really uncomfortable.

31:00.032 --> 31:01.294
I know.

31:01.381 --> 31:02.730
God, I think Mike
noticed it too.

31:02.817 --> 31:04.384
He did.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.777
Do you think she cheats on him?

31:06.865 --> 31:08.214
I don't know.

31:08.301 --> 31:11.478
I can actually say
something to him.

31:11.565 --> 31:13.045
I don't know.

31:13.132 --> 31:14.220
Maybe she just likes
to flirts a little.

31:14.307 --> 31:16.178
I don't think it's a big deal.

31:16.265 --> 31:16.787
I know, but I don't want him
to go through another divorce

31:16.875 --> 31:18.528
with the kids.

31:18.615 --> 31:20.139
Do you really think she'd
actually cheat on him?

31:20.226 --> 31:21.923
I didn't.

31:22.010 --> 31:24.404
But something happened a
couple of months ago and maybe

31:24.491 --> 31:25.231
she could.

31:25.318 --> 31:25.753
I don't know.

31:28.277 --> 31:30.323
Wait, what happened?

31:30.410 --> 31:31.411
What are you talking about?

31:31.498 --> 31:33.500
I promised I wouldn't say.

31:33.587 --> 31:36.590
Really, Steve?

31:36.677 --> 31:37.983
What happened?

31:38.070 --> 31:39.288
Reece called me
when I was at work.

31:39.375 --> 31:40.724
She was at the Marriott.

31:40.811 --> 31:42.465
She was doing
something for work...

31:42.552 --> 31:43.727
A multi-level period crap.

31:43.814 --> 31:45.512
Yeah, her battery died.

31:45.599 --> 31:48.994
And she said, can I use
your AAA, because hers

31:49.081 --> 31:50.604
had b not been renewed.

31:50.691 --> 31:52.867
I went down because
I had to be there.

31:52.954 --> 31:56.001
And that was it, no big deal.

31:56.088 --> 31:57.872
Why didn't she just call Mike?

31:57.959 --> 31:59.526
Because Mike had told her to
renew it and she'd forgot.

31:59.613 --> 32:02.529
And you know he gets anal
about shit like that.

32:02.616 --> 32:03.660
That was it.

32:03.747 --> 32:05.271
I had forgot about it till now.

32:05.358 --> 32:07.012
Well, so nothing
happened though, right?

32:07.099 --> 32:08.622
No.

32:08.709 --> 32:11.233
I mean, she asked
if I wanted a drink

32:11.320 --> 32:13.018
and I said, no,
because I was busy.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.194
And that was it.

32:15.281 --> 32:16.412
Honestly, it wasn't a big deal.

32:16.499 --> 32:17.936
And that's why I
didn't tell you.

32:22.331 --> 32:24.029
What is it?

32:24.116 --> 32:25.378
Nothing.

32:25.465 --> 32:27.206
What?

32:27.293 --> 32:30.383
Well, I mean, I just
don't get why she thinks

32:30.470 --> 32:33.038
it's OK to flirt with you.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.040
So now it's my fault.

32:35.127 --> 32:36.737
I see a lot of girls
flirt with you.

32:36.824 --> 32:39.000
But Reese knows that you
and Mike are best friend.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.132
What was your point?

32:40.219 --> 32:41.089
I didn't get what your point is.

32:41.176 --> 32:41.872
Well, did you fuck her?

32:41.960 --> 32:43.265
Oh, my God.

32:43.352 --> 32:44.353
I fucking knew you'd
go there again.

32:44.440 --> 32:46.094
Well, then why did
you bring it up?

32:46.181 --> 32:46.921
Because I clearly need
my fucking head examined.

32:47.008 --> 32:47.835
Yeah, you do!

32:47.922 --> 32:49.141
Oh, my God.

32:49.228 --> 32:50.142
Steve, what the fuck!

32:50.229 --> 32:52.492
Don't walk out on me!

32:52.579 --> 32:55.060
Fuck you!

32:55.147 --> 32:58.193
At this point, we could clearly
see a pattern of violence.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.847
This is when we
consulted with Darba,

32:59.934 --> 33:01.066
and they told us to continue.

33:01.153 --> 33:02.284
Is that correct?

33:02.371 --> 33:04.504
Drugs have side effects.

33:04.591 --> 33:07.246
And the bottom line here
is that there was nothing

33:07.333 --> 33:09.204
involved in this
trial that would not

33:09.291 --> 33:12.947
be found in something similar
to hormone replacement therapy.

33:13.034 --> 33:17.734
But didn't you guys kill a guy
once when you were testing LSD?

33:17.821 --> 33:18.822
That was the CIA.

33:18.909 --> 33:20.781
And that was 45 years ago.

33:20.868 --> 33:23.262
Well, who were the ones who
tried to control the weather,

33:23.349 --> 33:26.178
to use floods and
hurricanes in warfare.

33:26.265 --> 33:27.831
That's actually classified.

33:27.918 --> 33:28.832
I can't comment on that.

33:28.919 --> 33:32.097
OK, can we please focus?

33:32.184 --> 33:35.361
I had the craziest
dream last night.

33:35.448 --> 33:37.102
We had a giant Lego set.

33:37.189 --> 33:40.627
And Emily was building
all these amazing things.

33:40.714 --> 33:43.369
She built a diesel
truck with a trailer.

33:43.456 --> 33:48.287
It was so detailed,
the dream, I mean.

33:48.374 --> 33:49.897
I could see all
these little pieces.

33:52.204 --> 33:55.511
Sweetie, if you wanted to go
to Legoland, all you had to do

33:55.598 --> 33:56.034
was ask.

34:05.478 --> 34:07.175
What are you doing?

34:07.262 --> 34:09.003
What?

34:09.090 --> 34:10.264
You don't like bananas.

34:10.351 --> 34:11.962
Yeah, I do.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.529
It's just that I didn't
when I was a little girl,

34:13.616 --> 34:14.661
because my oldest sister
said she hated them.

34:14.748 --> 34:18.143
And I wanted to be like her.

34:18.230 --> 34:19.840
Beth, did you hear
what you just said?

34:22.799 --> 34:23.713
Oh, my God.

34:23.800 --> 34:24.670
Oh, my God.

34:24.757 --> 34:25.628
I'm eating a banana.

34:25.715 --> 34:27.021
Yeah.

34:27.108 --> 34:30.677
I'd totally forgotten.

34:30.764 --> 34:31.895
The DPT works.

34:31.982 --> 34:34.072
Yeah.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.943
Ever since I've
known you, you've

34:36.030 --> 34:37.422
avoided bananas like the plague.

34:37.510 --> 34:40.382
I actually like it.

34:40.469 --> 34:42.123
They say it kicks in
at different times

34:42.210 --> 34:43.297
for different people.

34:43.385 --> 34:44.777
Yeah.

34:44.864 --> 34:47.172
Hey, let's try
something else for me.

34:47.259 --> 34:48.737
Like what?

34:48.824 --> 34:52.306
Ask me what you've
been wanting to know.

34:52.393 --> 34:55.527
Beth, I wasn't going
to ask anything.

34:55.614 --> 34:57.878
You know, ask me if I like guys.

34:57.965 --> 34:59.880
Beth, I wasn't going to.

34:59.967 --> 35:00.707
I don't.

35:00.794 --> 35:02.709
I never have.

35:02.796 --> 35:04.058
When I was with my boyfriend,
the only way I could be sexual

35:04.145 --> 35:06.887
was to pretend I
was with a woman.

35:06.974 --> 35:08.802
Really?

35:08.889 --> 35:12.980
My go-tos were Melanie Swinson
from third period History

35:13.067 --> 35:15.678
or Posh Spice.

35:15.765 --> 35:18.028
It must have been
really hard not knowing.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.770
I know, but I had to
pretend to be straight.

35:20.857 --> 35:24.252
Because I knew what it
would do to my parents.

35:24.339 --> 35:26.559
You told me you didn't know.

35:26.646 --> 35:28.256
I convinced myself I didn't.

35:28.343 --> 35:30.954
Because it's too hard to
accept I was living a lie.

35:34.001 --> 35:34.871
What about you?

35:34.958 --> 35:35.959
Did you know?

35:36.046 --> 35:36.569
Oh, yeah.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.266
I knew.

35:38.353 --> 35:41.400
But I thought you
could be fixed.

35:41.487 --> 35:43.706
You know, like if I went
to therapy or something.

35:43.793 --> 35:47.754
So I avoided boys and dating
and hoped that it would change.

35:47.841 --> 35:49.843
But I didn't want to
be alone my whole life.

35:49.930 --> 35:51.758
When did you know it
wasn't going to change?

35:51.845 --> 35:53.977
Senior year when I met Teresa.

35:56.502 --> 35:58.112
Did she know?

35:58.199 --> 36:00.245
I convinced myself that she did.

36:00.332 --> 36:01.942
We were best friends.

36:02.029 --> 36:04.423
And I started believing
we were secretly a couple.

36:04.510 --> 36:05.989
So I'd drop little hints.

36:06.076 --> 36:08.427
And I thought we were
on the same page.

36:08.514 --> 36:10.342
What happened?

36:10.429 --> 36:13.954
We had a screaming match in
front of the entire school.

36:14.041 --> 36:15.216
We called her slut.

36:15.303 --> 36:16.304
She called me and dyke.

36:16.391 --> 36:18.698
People teased.

36:18.785 --> 36:21.614
And she stopped talking
to me altogether.

36:21.701 --> 36:24.182
And I didn't think I
would ever get over it.

36:27.794 --> 36:29.056
I even thought about suicide.

36:32.755 --> 36:35.454
But I couldn't do that my mom.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.630
Must have been awful.

36:37.717 --> 36:39.893
It was.

36:39.980 --> 36:45.028
But then I said fuck it
and decided to come out.

36:45.115 --> 36:45.812
I love you.

36:49.729 --> 36:53.515
I'd never do
anything to hurt you.

36:53.602 --> 36:57.780
Important to me that
you believe that.

36:57.867 --> 36:58.216
I do.

37:09.139 --> 37:09.966
I love you too.

37:21.543 --> 37:22.588
I'm starting to have...

37:25.939 --> 37:30.509
I'm starting to have some
concerns about this drug

37:30.596 --> 37:31.510
that you gave us.

37:35.601 --> 37:38.821
Lorie and I have had our
fair share of fights.

37:38.908 --> 37:45.959
Some of them really heated,
but this last one was...

37:52.966 --> 37:55.055
Hey, we should probably
think about dinner.

37:58.145 --> 37:59.320
What's wrong with you?

37:59.407 --> 38:02.367
You want the cream cheese?

38:02.454 --> 38:03.542
What the fuck, Lorie?

38:03.629 --> 38:05.761
Real mature.

38:05.848 --> 38:07.241
What the fuck, Lorie?

38:07.328 --> 38:08.242
Stop it!

38:14.683 --> 38:18.774
I said knock that shit off!

38:18.861 --> 38:19.166
Huh?

38:23.649 --> 38:25.128
[lorie gasping for air]

38:34.181 --> 38:35.443
I'm sorry.

38:35.530 --> 38:36.183
I'm sorry.

38:36.270 --> 38:37.445
I'm sorry.

38:37.532 --> 38:38.403
Get off of me!

38:38.490 --> 38:39.142
I'm sorry.

38:39.229 --> 38:39.621
Fuck you.

38:44.104 --> 38:45.018
[lorie sobbing]

39:03.602 --> 39:07.127
It was at this point that we had
considered stopping the study.

39:07.214 --> 39:09.695
But then we continued
to evaluate the footage.

39:09.782 --> 39:12.437
We felt that Andrew
and Lorie were actually

39:12.524 --> 39:13.829
making breakthroughs.

39:13.916 --> 39:17.311
So you consider
assault a breakthrough?

39:17.398 --> 39:19.052
In a way, yes.

39:19.139 --> 39:21.402
And with the other couples,
we saw many reasons

39:21.489 --> 39:22.969
as to why we should continue.

39:23.056 --> 39:25.058
OK, at this point, I
think the parameters

39:25.145 --> 39:29.149
you allowed this trial to exist
within went well beyond reason.

39:29.236 --> 39:31.151
If you would just
watch the footage,

39:31.238 --> 39:33.545
you'll see that we acted
well within the boundaries we

39:33.632 --> 39:34.154
were given.

39:37.636 --> 39:41.857
If this DPT thing
doesn't work, I

39:41.944 --> 39:44.773
don't know if I can stay in
this marriage any longer.

39:44.860 --> 39:47.472
We are just in this
horrible cycle.

39:47.559 --> 39:51.345
And I don't know how to stop it.

39:57.264 --> 39:58.178
I'm baked.

39:58.265 --> 40:00.006
Hey.

40:00.093 --> 40:01.355
How as your day?

40:01.442 --> 40:02.922
Better.

40:03.009 --> 40:05.490
I took one of those pills.

40:05.577 --> 40:07.143
That's good.

40:07.230 --> 40:08.144
Yeah, how are you doing?

40:08.231 --> 40:10.233
I'm fine.

40:10.320 --> 40:11.844
What?

40:11.931 --> 40:16.457
I just got off the phone
with Jim from the CEO.

40:16.544 --> 40:18.372
He called you this late?

40:18.459 --> 40:19.286
Oh, no.

40:19.373 --> 40:21.201
I called him back.

40:21.288 --> 40:24.030
It turns out they saw the
dailies and they're terrible.

40:24.117 --> 40:25.684
Why?

40:25.771 --> 40:29.949
Well, they want to fire
the bloody director.

40:30.036 --> 40:31.646
Halfway through the shoot?

40:31.733 --> 40:33.561
Yeah, they might pull the
plug on the whole thing.

40:33.648 --> 40:35.128
It's just a mess.

40:35.215 --> 40:36.956
I think they're losing
confidence in me.

40:39.785 --> 40:41.700
It's my fault, isn't it?

40:41.787 --> 40:43.615
What are you talking about?

40:43.702 --> 40:47.575
It's because you
weren't on set that day.

40:47.662 --> 40:49.142
No.

40:49.229 --> 40:53.494
I mean, it didn't help,
but it's not your fault.

40:53.581 --> 40:55.104
God.

40:55.191 --> 40:57.542
Yeah, it's because I
had that panic attack.

40:57.629 --> 40:59.108
Look, I wanted to
be there for you.

40:59.195 --> 40:59.892
I wanted to leave.

41:08.683 --> 41:11.469
I'm ruining your career.

41:11.556 --> 41:12.426
You're not.

41:16.212 --> 41:21.696
The studio made me
a crazy offer today.

41:21.783 --> 41:23.655
What?

41:23.742 --> 41:25.570
I didn't say yes.

41:25.657 --> 41:27.354
But they said, if I
wanted to, I could

41:27.441 --> 41:29.225
stay in one of those
bungalows off of [inaudible]..

41:29.312 --> 41:31.271
You know the ones
they use for talent?

41:31.358 --> 41:33.229
Yeah.

41:33.316 --> 41:34.666
They said they'd bump my salary
if I stayed in one to oversee

41:34.753 --> 41:35.797
the rest of the shoot.

41:39.366 --> 41:41.673
Then you should do it.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.152
I don't know.

41:43.239 --> 41:44.937
I mean, it's right
across the street.

41:45.024 --> 41:46.721
It'd be worth it for
you to just not have

41:46.808 --> 41:50.725
to drive in traffic
for two hours a day.

41:50.812 --> 41:52.858
Seriously, you should do it.

41:52.945 --> 41:53.511
I'll be fine.

41:56.383 --> 41:57.776
It's only for three weeks.

41:57.863 --> 41:59.778
You sure?

41:59.865 --> 42:00.387
I'm sure.

42:03.216 --> 42:09.396
Maybe you can swing by at
lunch for some sexy time.

42:09.483 --> 42:10.745
I'd like that.

42:10.832 --> 42:12.312
I'd love that.

42:17.665 --> 42:18.274
Thank you.

42:22.627 --> 42:24.716
I love you.

42:24.803 --> 42:25.891
I love you.

42:49.262 --> 42:51.917
I spoke to my
brother Justin today.

42:52.004 --> 42:53.614
And this has been
pretty hard on him.

42:53.701 --> 42:56.574
But he did this to himself.

42:56.661 --> 42:59.272
You know, even after Beth
and I worked things out,

42:59.359 --> 43:02.667
I don't know if I'm ever going
to be able to forgive him.

43:02.754 --> 43:04.364
Emily, I need you to believe me.

43:04.451 --> 43:06.279
Come on, you know I
would never do that.

43:09.456 --> 43:10.936
What?

43:11.023 --> 43:11.632
You really think I'm
that kind of person?

43:11.719 --> 43:12.981
I don't.

43:13.068 --> 43:14.374
But that does not
change the fact

43:14.461 --> 43:16.376
that you had sex
with my girlfriend.

43:16.463 --> 43:18.378
It's like a slap in
the face every time I

43:18.465 --> 43:23.165
know she's been talking to
him or texted him or whatever.

43:26.995 --> 43:28.475
And then today...

43:34.829 --> 43:38.833
Hey, how was work?

43:38.920 --> 43:41.009
It was work, nothing special.

43:43.098 --> 43:44.970
I don't know if it's
the medicine or what,

43:45.057 --> 43:48.277
but I've been in a really pissy
mood all day more that usual,

43:48.364 --> 43:50.149
even for work.

43:50.236 --> 43:56.198
Honey, kind of like you're
going to explode at any moment?

43:56.285 --> 43:58.766
Exactly.

43:58.853 --> 44:01.726
Did you notice
anything else with it?

44:01.813 --> 44:03.597
Not really.

44:03.684 --> 44:04.990
Why?

44:05.077 --> 44:09.168
I'm just curious
if maybe you had

44:09.255 --> 44:11.692
some more insight
on that night or...

44:11.779 --> 44:12.475
What?

44:12.562 --> 44:13.781
With Justin?

44:13.868 --> 44:15.217
Yeah.

44:15.304 --> 44:15.870
You know...

44:15.957 --> 44:16.871
What?

44:16.958 --> 44:17.785
If I changed my mind?

44:17.872 --> 44:19.352
Yeah.

44:19.439 --> 44:20.875
If suddenly I realized
I made a mistake?

44:20.962 --> 44:22.398
Yeah.

44:22.485 --> 44:24.966
No, I'm perfectly
clear on what happened.

44:25.053 --> 44:27.055
OK, because he came
over here today.

44:27.142 --> 44:28.056
Justin did today?

44:28.143 --> 44:30.363
While you were at work.

44:30.450 --> 44:31.973
Are you kidding me?

44:32.060 --> 44:33.235
Emily, why?

44:33.322 --> 44:34.802
Because he wanted to apologize.

44:34.889 --> 44:36.761
For what, raping me, or
something else he did?

44:36.848 --> 44:39.807
That's a really serious
allegation, Beth.

44:39.894 --> 44:42.288
Not only everyone's
taking it seriously, Em.

44:42.375 --> 44:45.552
Look, I'm being honest here, OK?

44:45.639 --> 44:48.337
I'm really trying to understand
exactly what happened.

44:48.424 --> 44:49.556
Oh, I'm sorry.

44:49.643 --> 44:50.862
This is a little
rough on me too.

44:50.949 --> 44:52.559
Now I was the one
who was violated

44:52.646 --> 44:54.692
and having to beg my
girlfriend to believe me.

44:54.779 --> 44:56.258
I should report
him to the police

44:56.345 --> 44:57.912
right now before he does
it to somebody else.

44:57.999 --> 45:00.001
Then fucking call!

45:00.088 --> 45:01.176
Why don't you just call?

45:01.263 --> 45:02.525
Here, I'll call then for you.

45:02.612 --> 45:04.789
Fine.

45:04.876 --> 45:06.312
Beth, what are you doing?

45:06.399 --> 45:07.617
Reporting a rape,
just like you said.

45:07.705 --> 45:09.445
Give me the fucking phone.

45:09.532 --> 45:10.969
It's not funny.

45:11.056 --> 45:12.579
You're going to destroy
his fucking life!

45:12.666 --> 45:16.583
What about my life, our life?

45:22.676 --> 45:26.680
You either believe his story,
or you have some sick allegiance

45:26.767 --> 45:27.246
towards him.

45:35.080 --> 45:40.607
Either way, you don't
think much of me.

45:40.694 --> 45:41.695
I'm leaving.

45:41.782 --> 45:42.261
That's not...

45:49.137 --> 45:50.269
[door closes]

45:57.102 --> 45:59.539
What are you doing?

45:59.626 --> 46:00.932
Why didn't you tell me?

46:01.019 --> 46:02.847
Tell you what?

46:02.934 --> 46:05.937
About Reese calling you at work.

46:06.024 --> 46:07.373
We've been over this, Kristina.

46:09.984 --> 46:12.117
Have you been lying up,
obsessing about this?

46:12.204 --> 46:14.206
Is that why you want to
stay at the bungalow?

46:17.470 --> 46:20.168
So you can just fuck her without
having to rush home to me?

46:20.255 --> 46:21.561
Where are you going?

46:21.648 --> 46:22.867
Kristina, it's 3:00
in the morning.

46:22.954 --> 46:24.216
I've got to be up
in three hours.

46:24.303 --> 46:25.086
I don't want to get...

46:25.173 --> 46:26.044
Just talk to me.

46:26.131 --> 46:28.133
What can I possibly say?

46:28.220 --> 46:30.875
Why didn't you tell me
the day it happened?

46:30.962 --> 46:32.441
It didn't occur to me.

46:32.528 --> 46:34.792
Why?

46:34.879 --> 46:36.402
You know what?

46:36.489 --> 46:37.403
Call AAA, and ask them
what I did after I left.

46:37.490 --> 46:38.404
Stop it.

46:38.491 --> 46:39.797
I knew.

46:39.884 --> 46:41.407
I knew I shouldn't
have told you.

46:41.494 --> 46:45.193
Now we're here, and
you are acting crazy.

46:45.280 --> 46:47.065
Have I ever cheated on you?

46:47.152 --> 46:48.240
Not that I know of.

46:48.327 --> 46:49.328
Not that you know of?

46:49.415 --> 46:50.982
Oh, great.

46:51.069 --> 46:52.548
That's what I get for
being a loyal husband.

46:52.635 --> 46:54.246
Steve, you know that
I have trust issues.

46:54.333 --> 46:56.378
And this bitch is trying
to fuck my husband.

46:56.465 --> 46:58.903
So forgive me for being upset
and wanting to talk about it!

46:58.990 --> 47:00.513
You don't talk about it though.

47:00.600 --> 47:02.254
You obsess about it.

47:02.341 --> 47:04.604
I'm physically and
mentally exhausted.

47:04.691 --> 47:06.214
I've got to be on set.

47:06.301 --> 47:08.129
They've already hinted
about replacing me.

47:08.216 --> 47:11.524
I'm not losing another job
because of your paranoia.

47:21.012 --> 47:22.056
Fucking bitch!

47:22.143 --> 47:23.014
Don't fucking call me crazy!

47:23.101 --> 47:24.015
I'm not crazy.

47:24.102 --> 47:26.278
Let me go!

47:26.365 --> 47:27.409
You going to calm down?

47:27.496 --> 47:29.063
No, don't tell me to calm down!

47:29.150 --> 47:31.109
Then I'm not letting go!

47:31.196 --> 47:32.327
[steven yells in pain]

47:32.414 --> 47:33.241
Fuck!

47:33.328 --> 47:40.770
[kristina shrieks]

47:40.858 --> 47:41.771
I wasn't going to do it.

47:41.859 --> 47:42.337
Fuck you!

47:55.220 --> 48:00.486
Justin, I need you to tell
me what happened exactly

48:00.573 --> 48:02.009
as it happened.

48:02.096 --> 48:03.184
I have.

48:03.271 --> 48:06.057
OK, I told you she kissed me.

48:06.144 --> 48:10.191
And I hesitated,
but she kept at it.

48:10.278 --> 48:11.976
Eventually, I gave in.

48:12.063 --> 48:15.936
Is it possible at
all that she said no,

48:16.023 --> 48:19.026
and you didn't
take her seriously?

48:19.113 --> 48:21.333
The fuck are you doing here?

48:21.420 --> 48:22.464
I'm talking to my sister.

48:22.551 --> 48:24.205
Do you have a problem with that?

48:24.292 --> 48:27.687
I told you to stay the
fuck away from both of us.

48:27.774 --> 48:30.646
Some people aren't as
easily manipulated by you.

48:30.733 --> 48:31.604
Stop it, Justin.

48:31.691 --> 48:32.953
Oh, fuck off, Emily!

48:33.040 --> 48:33.911
You fuck off!

48:36.391 --> 48:38.741
We both betrayed, Em.

48:38.828 --> 48:39.917
But you...

48:40.004 --> 48:41.179
Get the fuck out of my house!

48:41.266 --> 48:42.920
Both of you need to stop!

48:46.314 --> 48:50.710
I am just trying to
understand what is possibly...

48:50.797 --> 48:54.105
Emily, listen to me.

48:54.192 --> 48:56.542
It's him or me right
here, right now.

48:56.629 --> 48:58.283
I'll leave if that's
what you want.

48:58.370 --> 49:00.067
You'll never have
to see me again.

49:00.154 --> 49:03.331
I'll send someone
to get my stuff.

49:03.418 --> 49:10.686
But I'm begging you, I don't
want you alone with him.

49:10.773 --> 49:11.731
He is dangerous.

49:11.818 --> 49:12.471
Just go!

49:12.558 --> 49:13.254
You go!

49:13.341 --> 49:15.735
Both of you!

49:15.822 --> 49:20.435
You first, or I'll call the
police right fucking now.

49:33.231 --> 49:34.667
I'm losing you.

49:37.278 --> 49:38.410
It's not fair.

49:38.497 --> 49:38.845
Just go.

49:46.287 --> 49:47.375
[door closes]

49:52.685 --> 49:55.079
For every step we take
forward, if feels like we

49:55.166 --> 49:56.515
take two steps backwards.

50:08.353 --> 50:14.185
Hey, will you talk to me?

50:14.272 --> 50:16.404
Now you want to talk.

50:16.491 --> 50:19.103
Thought you needed to sleep.

50:19.190 --> 50:21.279
That ship has already sailed.

50:21.366 --> 50:24.282
I don't want to cost
you another project.

50:24.369 --> 50:25.413
I'm sorry.

50:25.500 --> 50:27.546
I shouldn't have said that.

50:27.633 --> 50:29.635
Don't you have to go to work?

50:29.722 --> 50:30.592
I called.

50:30.679 --> 50:31.332
I'm going to go in late.

50:31.419 --> 50:32.420
It's fine.

50:32.507 --> 50:35.728
You don't have to do that.

50:35.815 --> 50:38.557
Hey, I love you.

50:41.255 --> 50:43.475
I feel so bad about last night.

50:43.562 --> 50:45.825
I feel horrendous.

50:45.912 --> 50:48.915
I was lying on the couch,
and I was thinking.

50:49.002 --> 50:51.787
I've realized some things.

50:51.874 --> 50:52.745
Like what?

50:55.095 --> 50:57.358
You know when you asked me
about why I didn't tell you,

50:57.445 --> 51:00.057
and I said it
didn't occur to me?

51:00.144 --> 51:01.014
Yeah.

51:01.101 --> 51:04.017
That was not the truth.

51:04.104 --> 51:04.583
Why?

51:08.717 --> 51:14.332
Honestly, because I was worried
it would make you jealous.

51:14.419 --> 51:16.421
I'm constantly hiding
things, because I'm always

51:16.508 --> 51:18.379
worried about what
you're going to think.

51:21.643 --> 51:24.081
I think I should be
more honest and that

51:24.168 --> 51:25.386
would help us get past this.

51:28.128 --> 51:32.045
I'm sorry you're married
to a crazy, paranoid bitch.

51:32.132 --> 51:35.048
I don't think you're crazy.

51:35.135 --> 51:36.528
No?

51:36.615 --> 51:37.529
We've got issues.

51:37.616 --> 51:39.226
We can work on them.

51:39.313 --> 51:40.793
I'll help you.

51:44.275 --> 51:45.624
My mind just goes there.

51:49.106 --> 51:51.934
I know that I should trust you.

51:52.021 --> 51:54.415
Well, you should.

51:54.502 --> 51:57.723
Can't help it.

51:57.810 --> 52:01.640
This happen with your
previous boyfriends?

52:01.727 --> 52:02.031
No.

52:10.257 --> 52:13.565
I see the way that
girls look at you.

52:13.652 --> 52:15.871
Yeah?

52:15.958 --> 52:16.785
I'm only human.

52:19.136 --> 52:23.009
Yeah, you're handsome
and you're successful.

52:23.096 --> 52:23.792
Carry on.

52:23.879 --> 52:24.663
Oh, shut up.

52:28.362 --> 52:30.538
At first, I took
it as a compliment.

52:34.151 --> 52:40.113
Saw girls staring at you, and
I was like, yeah, you wish.

52:40.200 --> 52:40.722
What changed?

52:46.598 --> 52:49.122
Do you remember when
I told you that I

52:49.209 --> 52:52.604
thought your assistant
Brandi was flirting with you?

52:52.691 --> 52:54.997
Yeah.

52:55.084 --> 53:01.265
Well, after that, you started
acting different towards her.

53:01.352 --> 53:02.657
You were nicer.

53:02.744 --> 53:04.572
It was like you were
encouraging her.

53:04.659 --> 53:06.922
And you want to know why?

53:07.009 --> 53:08.533
Why?

53:08.620 --> 53:11.231
After that, I went and
told human resources

53:11.318 --> 53:12.972
to reassign her.

53:13.059 --> 53:14.060
They asked why.

53:14.147 --> 53:15.192
And I said what you said.

53:15.279 --> 53:16.280
I didn't want it to be awkward.

53:16.367 --> 53:18.238
Well, apparently, she found out.

53:18.325 --> 53:19.805
And she said you
wanted her fired,

53:19.892 --> 53:21.415
because you didn't want
your husband having

53:21.502 --> 53:22.938
a pretty assistant.

53:23.025 --> 53:24.288
That bitch.

53:24.375 --> 53:25.463
I never said that.

53:25.550 --> 53:27.029
Yeah, I know.

53:27.116 --> 53:28.640
But the thing turned
it into a big deal.

53:28.727 --> 53:30.294
And she threatened to sue.

53:30.381 --> 53:31.599
And that's why I had...

53:31.686 --> 53:34.123
I was told to play nice.

53:34.211 --> 53:37.301
That's why you didn't want
me coming to work as much.

53:37.388 --> 53:39.825
Honestly, yeah.

53:45.265 --> 53:46.701
That little cunt.

53:53.273 --> 53:56.189
It was at this point that we
had suspected that the drug had

53:56.276 --> 53:57.799
stopped working on Kristina.

53:57.886 --> 53:59.584
She didn't seem to be
making any progress.

53:59.671 --> 54:01.586
But Andrew seemed to be
having a breakthrough.

54:01.673 --> 54:03.370
He was being more open with her.

54:03.457 --> 54:04.980
He was being honest.

54:05.067 --> 54:07.940
Why didn't you find
out more information?

54:08.027 --> 54:10.247
Didn't you see
the warning signs?

54:10.334 --> 54:13.772
Darba had already set guidelines
in regards to its animals

54:13.859 --> 54:16.992
trials to not disrupt
the physiological

54:17.079 --> 54:20.300
or the psychological
development of the compound.

54:20.387 --> 54:24.348
Effects of this type sometimes
took months, sometimes days

54:24.435 --> 54:25.479
with the animals.

54:25.566 --> 54:29.353
These aren't animals, are they?

54:29.440 --> 54:30.049
They're people!

54:39.798 --> 54:45.369
I have bruises on my arm and
a knot on the back of my head.

54:45.456 --> 54:48.110
And I swear to God,
I've never, ever

54:48.197 --> 54:49.198
been this pissed at Andrew.

54:53.812 --> 54:54.160
Hey.

54:59.513 --> 55:01.123
What, are you still
not talking to me?

55:01.210 --> 55:02.951
You still being an asshole?

55:03.038 --> 55:05.171
Either way I answer
that, I'll be admitting

55:05.258 --> 55:06.085
that I was an asshole.

55:09.480 --> 55:12.178
OK, I'm sorry.

55:12.265 --> 55:13.745
I'm sorry.

55:13.832 --> 55:16.400
I was being an asshole.

55:16.487 --> 55:17.923
Why do you do that?

55:18.010 --> 55:19.054
I'm sorry.

55:19.141 --> 55:21.796
Not that, those word games.

55:21.883 --> 55:24.277
[stuttering] Any
way I answer it.

55:24.364 --> 55:25.844
I feel stupid.

55:25.931 --> 55:27.585
By no means am I trying
to make you feel stupid.

55:27.672 --> 55:31.197
I argue the law for
a living, Lorie.

55:31.284 --> 55:32.938
I can't just turn it off.

55:33.025 --> 55:36.028
Try harder, it's really
fucking irritating.

55:36.115 --> 55:38.160
You know what's really
fucking irritating?

55:38.247 --> 55:40.424
The fact that you're
so proud that you slept

55:40.511 --> 55:41.642
with hundreds of men for money.

55:41.729 --> 55:42.774
You think I'm proud of that?

55:42.861 --> 55:44.341
I am not proud of that.

55:44.428 --> 55:47.518
Well, you're certainly
not ashamed of it.

55:47.605 --> 55:49.433
It is my past.

55:49.520 --> 55:51.435
I can't change it.

55:51.522 --> 55:52.784
Why are you so jealous?

55:52.871 --> 55:55.395
I am not jealous, goddamn!

55:55.482 --> 55:57.441
What do you keep saying that?

55:57.528 --> 55:58.659
Then what?

55:58.746 --> 55:59.399
What is it?

55:59.486 --> 56:00.139
Then what?

56:00.226 --> 56:02.707
Then what?

56:02.794 --> 56:05.666
Because I don't know what
it was like for you, Lorie.

56:08.582 --> 56:09.888
I can only imagine the worst.

56:12.847 --> 56:15.589
I know these guys.

56:15.676 --> 56:18.331
Motherfuckers can be cruel.

56:18.418 --> 56:19.811
I don't know what
they did to you.

56:19.898 --> 56:21.378
I don't know what
they said to you.

56:21.465 --> 56:23.249
Called you a whore.

56:23.336 --> 56:26.557
And that fucking word is so
ingrained in our language

56:26.644 --> 56:30.212
that it's implying that
you're less of a person.

56:38.090 --> 56:41.572
Do you think I'm less
of a person, Andrew?

56:41.659 --> 56:42.747
I didn't say that.

56:45.663 --> 56:48.492
It's just a word.

56:48.579 --> 56:54.019
And as far as
being called names,

56:54.106 --> 56:55.890
you think I would
let somebody get away

56:55.977 --> 57:00.504
with threatening me or
calling me names or putting

57:00.591 --> 57:03.985
their grimy little hands on me?

57:04.072 --> 57:08.033
Oh, yeah, I had
my nights where I

57:08.120 --> 57:09.861
had to put some
people in their place.

57:14.300 --> 57:20.132
This comes in handy when it's
time to realign the mood.

57:20.219 --> 57:22.830
Get him in his most
vulnerable position,

57:22.917 --> 57:24.441
then stick it in his mouth.

57:24.528 --> 57:26.660
Do you want to put the
gun away, please, Lorie.

57:33.580 --> 57:34.059
Geez.

57:37.802 --> 57:38.933
It was just sex, Andrew.

57:41.980 --> 57:45.244
And most of the time, it
was pretty uneventful.

57:45.331 --> 57:50.510
I just need you to stop
being so jealous about it.

57:50.597 --> 57:52.556
You're jealous.

57:52.643 --> 57:53.513
Think about it.

57:53.600 --> 57:55.167
Why would I be jealous?

57:55.254 --> 57:57.299
I have some of the best
clothes money can buy.

58:01.826 --> 58:05.786
I know for sure that
the medicine's working.

58:05.873 --> 58:07.179
And I know what I need to do.

58:12.227 --> 58:14.708
This turned out to be the
last of all the interviews.

58:42.519 --> 58:42.997
Hey.

58:45.739 --> 58:48.307
I know.

58:48.394 --> 58:51.049
I know, I need you to come
back over right now, OK?

58:54.226 --> 58:56.141
This isn't going
to be easy for me.

59:00.058 --> 59:01.581
OK.

59:01.668 --> 59:02.147
Bye.

59:26.998 --> 59:29.522
OK, yeah, all right.

59:29.609 --> 59:30.218
All right, bye.

59:33.482 --> 59:35.702
Hey, how was your day?

59:35.789 --> 59:36.529
Good.

59:36.616 --> 59:37.835
Who was that?

59:37.922 --> 59:41.578
That was just my mom.

59:41.665 --> 59:42.404
Oh, sorry I'm late.

59:42.491 --> 59:45.494
I was editing.

59:45.582 --> 59:46.539
How's it going?

59:46.626 --> 59:48.106
It's a bloody nightmare.

59:55.069 --> 59:58.682
So the edit was unwatchable,
and basically, we're

59:58.769 --> 59:59.857
having to redo the whole thing.

59:59.944 --> 01:00:03.382
And the studio is now pissed.

01:00:03.469 --> 01:00:05.602
I'm sorry, honey.

01:00:05.689 --> 01:00:06.298
How was your day?

01:00:09.997 --> 01:00:12.609
I think you need
a little foot rub.

01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:14.306
It was actually really good.

01:00:14.393 --> 01:00:14.959
Yeah?

01:00:15.046 --> 01:00:16.569
Good.

01:00:16.656 --> 01:00:19.137
I think the medicine's
starting to take effect.

01:00:19.224 --> 01:00:22.880
Because I was having all
sorts of revelations.

01:00:22.967 --> 01:00:24.838
About what?

01:00:24.925 --> 01:00:28.755
About how silly I've been
for not trusting you.

01:00:28.842 --> 01:00:29.669
Seriously?

01:00:29.756 --> 01:00:30.409
Yeah.

01:00:30.496 --> 01:00:32.019
Wow.

01:00:32.106 --> 01:00:34.456
I just started thinking
about all that stuff,

01:00:34.543 --> 01:00:38.722
like you coming home late, and
that whole thing about Reese.

01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:40.158
And remember that
time I thought you

01:00:40.245 --> 01:00:41.550
were flirting with my sister?

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:42.290
Yes, I do.

01:00:42.377 --> 01:00:43.814
Yeah.

01:00:43.901 --> 01:00:44.858
And the extra I thought
you were flirting

01:00:44.945 --> 01:00:46.773
with and your assistant.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:51.735
And I just realized how
illogical it all is.

01:00:51.822 --> 01:00:55.739
Because the reason
that it hurt me so much

01:00:55.826 --> 01:01:00.178
is just because I
love you so much.

01:01:00.265 --> 01:01:03.921
I think it's great you're
finally seeing some clarity.

01:01:04.008 --> 01:01:07.272
I do wish that your friends
and people you work with

01:01:07.359 --> 01:01:09.666
didn't think I was so paranoid.

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:10.841
Don't worry about that.

01:01:10.928 --> 01:01:11.798
I don't care what they think.

01:01:11.885 --> 01:01:12.799
I care what they think.

01:01:12.886 --> 01:01:17.282
But, I talked to Brandi.

01:01:17.369 --> 01:01:18.544
What?

01:01:18.631 --> 01:01:20.372
Don't worry.

01:01:20.459 --> 01:01:22.766
When you didn't come home,
I just called the office,

01:01:22.853 --> 01:01:24.419
and she picked up.

01:01:24.506 --> 01:01:26.160
And I thought it would
be a good opportunity

01:01:26.247 --> 01:01:29.642
to just clear the air,
get some clarity with her.

01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:31.252
But you promised.

01:01:31.339 --> 01:01:33.080
Relax, I didn't say
anything mean to here.

01:01:33.167 --> 01:01:34.865
What did you say?

01:01:34.952 --> 01:01:37.128
She sounded surprised,
especially when I brought up

01:01:37.215 --> 01:01:38.956
that whole HR thing.

01:01:39.043 --> 01:01:41.741
She said she had no idea
what I was talking about.

01:01:41.828 --> 01:01:42.916
Well, she's obviously lying.

01:01:43.003 --> 01:01:44.439
She doesn't want to get fired.

01:01:44.526 --> 01:01:45.658
This is a mess.

01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:50.141
Come on, she'll be fine.

01:01:50.228 --> 01:01:53.579
Then I called the
Marriott, and they

01:01:53.666 --> 01:01:57.801
said that there wasn't a Mary
Kay convention on that day.

01:01:57.888 --> 01:01:59.193
So Reese lied?

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.891
I know.

01:02:00.978 --> 01:02:03.154
And then I called AAA.

01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:04.938
And then, they
confirmed your story.

01:02:05.025 --> 01:02:05.722
Yeah, I know.

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:06.635
I was there.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.812
Yeah.

01:02:08.899 --> 01:02:15.296
Then I got a really,
really crazy idea.

01:02:15.383 --> 01:02:17.690
What?

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:20.171
I called the Marriott again.

01:02:20.258 --> 01:02:22.347
And I told them that we
had stayed there on the day

01:02:22.434 --> 01:02:26.177
that it all happened and that
I had forgotten my earrings,

01:02:26.264 --> 01:02:29.049
and I didn't remember
what room we stayed in.

01:02:29.136 --> 01:02:31.530
So I asked them to
check the computers.

01:02:31.617 --> 01:02:36.013
And then, they said that there
was a room booked for two

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:42.106
under your name in room 218.

01:02:42.193 --> 01:02:45.370
And all the pieces, they
just fell into place.

01:02:45.457 --> 01:02:47.241
That's bullshit.

01:02:47.328 --> 01:02:49.853
Reese probably booked the room,
so Mike wouldn't find out.

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:50.854
I wasn't involved.

01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:52.420
Right.

01:02:52.507 --> 01:02:54.553
You know, I actually
thought about that.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.469
I thought about
calling her, bluffing,

01:02:57.556 --> 01:03:02.256
and then, I figured she'd
just catch my bluff.

01:03:02.343 --> 01:03:03.823
So I got a better idea...

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:04.389
call her.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:12.832
What?

01:03:12.919 --> 01:03:13.790
So she can be part of our drama

01:03:13.877 --> 01:03:14.660
Put her on speaker!

01:03:14.747 --> 01:03:15.269
Why?

01:03:15.356 --> 01:03:16.357
So...

01:03:16.444 --> 01:03:18.316
And tell her that I know.

01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:20.709
And if you're not fucking her,
she'll be really surprised.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.320
Bring her in...

01:03:22.407 --> 01:03:25.714
And if you are, she'll
ask how I found out.

01:03:28.587 --> 01:03:29.370
Call her!

01:03:34.985 --> 01:03:37.639
So what, you had clients a
couple of times a week, right?

01:03:37.726 --> 01:03:41.948
It's no different than having
a husband or a boyfriend.

01:03:42.035 --> 01:03:43.558
Exactly.

01:03:43.645 --> 01:03:47.911
So I guess because it
was with different men,

01:03:47.998 --> 01:03:50.652
it just seems worse.

01:03:50.739 --> 01:03:53.873
And I know that if you think
about it, it just seems silly.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.136
Why does it bother you?

01:03:56.223 --> 01:04:01.185
To be honest, it's
because I am afraid.

01:04:01.272 --> 01:04:05.406
I'm worried that it made
you feel bad about yourself.

01:04:05.493 --> 01:04:10.803
When I hear that word,
whore, it just bothers me,

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:12.979
even when you use it.

01:04:13.066 --> 01:04:14.938
I mean no offense with the word.

01:04:15.025 --> 01:04:19.029
But honestly, it can be used
for people in your profession

01:04:19.116 --> 01:04:20.944
or any profession.

01:04:21.031 --> 01:04:24.599
People use words and phrases to
try to make people feel stupid.

01:04:24.686 --> 01:04:27.864
When you do that to
me, that's how I feel...

01:04:27.951 --> 01:04:29.126
stupid.

01:04:29.213 --> 01:04:31.868
It's just... it's ironic.

01:04:34.653 --> 01:04:38.352
Andrew, I know
what ironic means.

01:04:38.439 --> 01:04:40.224
I know.

01:04:40.311 --> 01:04:43.575
It's just funny to me that
that makes you feel stupid.

01:04:43.662 --> 01:04:46.012
Because I only do it when I
know that you're ahead of me

01:04:46.099 --> 01:04:47.535
in the argument.

01:04:47.622 --> 01:04:52.845
Wait, so you're
admitting that I'm right?

01:04:57.676 --> 01:04:59.547
Are you trying to
get make-up sex?

01:04:59.634 --> 01:05:00.374
I don't know.

01:05:00.461 --> 01:05:00.984
Is it working?

01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:02.594
Not yet.

01:05:02.681 --> 01:05:04.465
Did I mention that you
are sexier than most

01:05:04.552 --> 01:05:06.076
of the girls I've
ever been with?

01:05:06.163 --> 01:05:07.686
Most?

01:05:07.773 --> 01:05:10.210
All of the girls that
I've ever been with.

01:05:10.297 --> 01:05:11.342
You're getting warmer.

01:05:17.043 --> 01:05:18.175
You know what it is?

01:05:18.262 --> 01:05:21.743
It's because I'm insecure.

01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:23.528
It's an insecurity thing.

01:05:23.615 --> 01:05:26.705
It's because I'm just
trying to win the argument,

01:05:26.792 --> 01:05:28.837
instead of trying to
come up with a resolution

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.970
for the conflict that we're in.

01:05:31.057 --> 01:05:33.103
God, I can be such
an ass sometimes.

01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:34.191
We all do it.

01:05:34.278 --> 01:05:34.887
Nobody wants to be wrong.

01:05:34.974 --> 01:05:36.019
I know.

01:05:36.106 --> 01:05:37.107
But for me, it's different.

01:05:37.194 --> 01:05:38.891
It's about being smarter.

01:05:38.978 --> 01:05:43.635
Actually, it's about seeming
smarter, I should say.

01:05:43.722 --> 01:05:44.810
Who gives a shit?

01:05:44.897 --> 01:05:45.724
I do.

01:05:45.811 --> 01:05:46.420
That's the thing.

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:50.990
I give a shit.

01:05:51.077 --> 01:05:54.341
It matters to me, because
I need to feel smarter.

01:05:54.428 --> 01:05:56.387
The equation
doesn't balance out.

01:05:56.474 --> 01:06:00.043
You are so beautiful
and so smart.

01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:03.089
So I have to seem so smart.

01:06:03.176 --> 01:06:05.962
I have to seem like a great
lawyer, or this doesn't work.

01:06:08.616 --> 01:06:10.575
You throw me off my game.

01:06:15.145 --> 01:06:17.060
You were right.

01:06:17.147 --> 01:06:19.236
About what?

01:06:19.323 --> 01:06:21.455
The other night.

01:06:21.542 --> 01:06:23.936
I honestly thought that you
were the one who brought up

01:06:24.023 --> 01:06:27.287
the arrest, but it was me.

01:06:27.374 --> 01:06:28.680
No, no, you're wrong about it.

01:06:28.767 --> 01:06:31.813
It was me.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:32.771
No.

01:06:32.858 --> 01:06:34.120
No, I remember now.

01:06:34.207 --> 01:06:36.035
I'm just, I'm so sure.

01:06:36.122 --> 01:06:40.300
I'm so worried that you're
so uncomfortable with my past

01:06:40.387 --> 01:06:46.654
that I automatically think
that you're upset about it.

01:06:46.741 --> 01:06:49.266
So when you started talking
about prior arrests,

01:06:49.353 --> 01:06:51.833
I thought you were
talking about me.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.097
I was.

01:06:54.184 --> 01:06:54.880
What?

01:06:54.967 --> 01:06:55.968
I said, you're.

01:06:56.055 --> 01:06:58.536
I said, you're.

01:06:58.623 --> 01:07:00.407
What are you talking
