00:01.001 --> 00:02.669
Previously on Prison Break:

00:02.752 --> 00:06.172
If Scylla was like a pizza,
all we got is a slice.

00:06.589 --> 00:08.299
So Scylla isn't one card.

00:08.550 --> 00:09.551
It's six.

00:10.301 --> 00:11.386
How long has
it been happening?

00:11.469 --> 00:12.470
It's not a big deal.

00:12.554 --> 00:13.888
It was a big deal
when you were thirteen.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.223
Michael told you about Mom?

00:15.432 --> 00:18.184
-No.
-As a kid, she got nosebleeds.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.270
In her thirties, they
started up again.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.980
How old was your mom
when she passed away?

00:22.063 --> 00:24.566
Thirty one. Michael's just
turning thirty one.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.277
Who's that?

00:27.485 --> 00:28.820
That's the man
that killed my son.

00:31.489 --> 00:32.615
Yes?

00:40.623 --> 00:42.042
It's really like
a digital black hole.

00:42.125 --> 00:45.003
It swallows up any electronic
data within ten feet of it.

00:46.296 --> 00:47.297
Mr. Glenn?

00:47.380 --> 00:48.465
We got a problem.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.091
What's that do?

00:50.175 --> 00:51.092
It's a battery pack

00:51.176 --> 00:52.635
for a video game console.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.513
You'll need
to buy a new one.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.059
Scylla.
Get it to me by tomorrow

00:59.142 --> 01:01.311
and you will receive
50% of the fee.

01:01.394 --> 01:04.230
Two days, 25%.

01:04.314 --> 01:05.690
Three days,

01:05.774 --> 01:06.900
I shoot you through the brain.

01:11.529 --> 01:12.655
Who is this?

01:12.906 --> 01:13.990
Hello, Michael.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.422
You know what?
If Crab ever throws

01:29.506 --> 01:32.008
a psycho at us like this again,
I'm going to kill him.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.178
Yeah, well if we don't get this psycho,
Crab's going to kill us.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.554
Just have the burner ready.

01:37.555 --> 01:38.973
Got it covered.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.686
After this job,
I'm done, man.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.647
I can't do this any more.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.691
What do you think
Crab will say about that?

01:48.775 --> 01:51.069
I don't care
what Crab says about that.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.947
How can I be a good father
if I'm always in prison?

01:54.489 --> 01:57.200
I missed out on
my kid's childhood.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.702
I'm not going to miss out
on him becoming a man.

02:00.578 --> 02:03.790
You know, not for nothing, but
this plan is crazy even for you.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.625
You sure this is the only way?

02:05.708 --> 02:06.960
Yeah.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.171
Hey look.
He's coming out.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.339
He's got the case.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.010
Let's buckle up.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.915
Put your hands up!
Put your hands up!

02:58.595 --> 02:59.596
You're welcome.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.680
Let's go!

03:09.063 --> 03:11.524
So wait a minute.
This is your brilliant plan?

03:12.358 --> 03:14.319
You're going to pull a kamikaze mission
on the General's car?

03:14.402 --> 03:15.486
Hey.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.488
Now that the device is gone,

03:17.572 --> 03:19.240
your opinion
doesn't matter.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.909
Now, shut up and pump.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.786
We know the General
travels light.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.246
One limo and
a couple of guards.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.707
It ain't the guards I'm worried
about. It's the crash.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.001
Look, I never said
this was going to be easy.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.059
Just relax.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.565
First off,
Panama was a job.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.025
Some other time.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.360
What do you want with Scylla?

03:55.443 --> 03:56.486
That's my business.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.737
We're not in
Panama any more,

03:57.820 --> 04:00.323
and I'm not behind
a fence, so, again,

04:00.406 --> 04:01.616
what do you want
with Scylla?

04:01.699 --> 04:03.910
Same thing you want:
bring down the Company.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.495
Great. Then why don't you

04:05.578 --> 04:07.455
give me those missing pages
and disappear?

04:07.538 --> 04:08.998
I'd love to.
You remember that day

04:09.082 --> 04:11.501
at the Roosevelt when Whistler
made off with Lief's card?

04:11.584 --> 04:13.544
Who do you think took
the fall for that?

04:13.628 --> 04:16.172
Our names are at the top
of the same hit list.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.383
Now, I don't know what
arrangement you two have,

04:18.466 --> 04:19.592
but I need some traveling money.

04:19.676 --> 04:20.718
Let's talk about that later.

04:20.802 --> 04:21.803
Why don't we talk
about the kind of scum

04:21.886 --> 04:23.304
you're willing
to put on the payroll?

04:23.388 --> 04:25.723
Give me a way to do it
without her, and we'll do it.

04:25.807 --> 04:26.975
We need the pages.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.311
It's a package deal.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.313
Are we partners?

04:36.526 --> 04:37.777
Partners.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.789
Look, I barely dropped
a nickel in the slots, right?

04:49.872 --> 04:50.999
This guy was all...

04:51.082 --> 04:52.458
We ought to
blanket party your ass.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.168
Where's the device?

04:54.252 --> 04:55.461
Can it be salvaged?

04:55.545 --> 04:56.462
Tell him.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.302
Pit boss
walked off with it.

05:02.385 --> 05:05.888
Okay. Well, we're going to call
this your early retirement.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.265
You can either
go upstairs

05:07.348 --> 05:09.642
and sit on your cot and ride
out the rest of this thing,

05:09.726 --> 05:10.977
or I can call Agent Self

05:11.060 --> 05:13.313
and you can ride out the rest
of your prison sentence.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.647
Your choice.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.248
I need to talk to you.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.338
So your brother told me
about your nosebleeds.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.256
And he told me
about your mom.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.507
That wasn't his place.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.343
-To be worried about you?
-When Mom got sick,

05:43.426 --> 05:46.846
Linc was at the hospital every day,
holding her hand,

05:46.929 --> 05:49.640
watching her die,
and he was thirteen.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.851
It changed him.
It made him overprotective.

05:51.934 --> 05:52.935
And now he's jumping

05:53.019 --> 05:53.936
to all the
wrong conclusions

05:54.020 --> 05:55.188
for all
the wrong reasons,

05:55.271 --> 05:56.606
and it's...
it's over nothing because

05:56.689 --> 05:58.107
I'm fine.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.235
You don't look fine.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.531
Well, maybe that's because

06:05.615 --> 06:07.283
there's something
I have to tell you.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.080
Gretchen's alive.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.958
She's working with T-Bag,

06:57.041 --> 06:59.460
and they have several pages
from Whistler's bird book,

06:59.544 --> 07:01.838
and they want in on Scylla.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.841
Self is cutting them
a deal as we speak.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.430
Self knows that they
have their own agenda,

07:10.513 --> 07:11.472
but so do we

07:11.556 --> 07:12.974
and as soon as we
get those pages back,

07:13.057 --> 07:15.685
Gretchen and T-Bag
are going to pay for everything.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.812
They're going to get exactly
what's coming to them.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.862
Okay.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.113
This isn't about Gretchen.

07:27.196 --> 07:29.365
It's not about
any one person.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.701
And we...
we have to finish it.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.040
I need a minute.

07:40.084 --> 07:41.127
Please.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.377
I can't believe this!

08:23.461 --> 08:25.505
What choice do we have?

08:25.588 --> 08:26.589
Gretchen's
on the team.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.508
Like it or not,
we need those pages.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.843
Another we're
jumping in bed with?

08:30.927 --> 08:32.220
Not exactly new
territory for us.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.763
I don't care who we gotta
partner up with.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.640
We get those papers,
we make with the break-in,

08:35.723 --> 08:37.099
we get this job done.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.851
She could still have ties to
the Company, man. I don't know.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.937
We'll worry about Gretchen
when the time is right.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.731
For now, let's focus
on the General.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.487
This thing with Gretchen
doesn't change a thing.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.280
We're, uh...

08:51.364 --> 08:53.115
we're still close.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.952
Closer to Scylla,
farther from Wyatt.

08:57.411 --> 08:58.621
You don't know that.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.289
Just stay focused, all right?

09:00.373 --> 09:02.124
This is my focus, okay?

09:02.208 --> 09:04.919
I'm doing the job, okay?
All right? All right?

09:05.002 --> 09:07.797
But every day, the trail to my son's
killer gets a little bit colder.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.842
That's all I do is focus.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.525
What are you doing?

09:27.942 --> 09:29.569
Um... It's just... uh...

09:29.652 --> 09:31.571
We're going
to need that downstairs.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.824
Yeah. I'll just, uh...
be up here.

10:41.223 --> 10:43.517
I see you two have
come to an agreement.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.186
She's on work release,

10:45.561 --> 10:46.812
just like you.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.065
What kind of work?

10:49.148 --> 10:51.108
You and the secretary
keep things quiet in the office

10:51.192 --> 10:52.568
while Michael
tunnels to Scylla.

10:54.945 --> 10:55.946
You really think

10:56.030 --> 10:57.239
Scofield's gonna keep
his word, huh?

10:59.283 --> 11:01.494
You horsewhipped
the woman he loves.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.954
Michael wants Scylla just
as badly as we do.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.581
Yeah, he wanted
out of prison, too.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.918
Our partnership lasted
long enough for that to happen,

11:09.001 --> 11:10.878
and then...
we parted ways.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.046
Trust me.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.674
Yeah, um, go in, sir.

11:14.882 --> 11:17.093
Scofield will use you,
and then he's gonna

11:17.259 --> 11:18.344
bury the knife
in your back

11:18.427 --> 11:19.679
for what you did
to his lady friend.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.514
Mr. Pfeiffer. Cole.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.435
Where's Scylla?

11:27.311 --> 11:28.938
Good morning to you, too, sir.

11:29.647 --> 11:30.523
Gentlemen.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.400
I gave you three days.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.110
Where's Scylla?

11:40.199 --> 11:43.411
Now, uh, Mr. Feng, let's
not do anything rash.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.956
So you're Feng.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.625
We haven't actually met
in person.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.544
I was the liaison between
the Company and your

11:51.627 --> 11:53.754
Chinese employers
on Operation Copperhead.

11:55.756 --> 11:56.882
Susan?

11:56.966 --> 11:57.967
That's right.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.553
You went from working
for the Company

12:00.636 --> 12:02.805
to stealing the one thing
that could destroy them.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.140
That's a tight turn.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.850
With a price that Scylla
commands on the open market,

12:05.933 --> 12:07.435
anybody would turn.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.603
Which is, by the way,
two hundred.

12:14.024 --> 12:16.277
Our paths never
crossed on Copperhead,

12:16.569 --> 12:19.363
but I did deal with one
of your colleagues...

12:19.447 --> 12:20.948
a less-capable associate.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.826
Whatever happened to him?

12:24.702 --> 12:26.620
He was skinned and hung
from an overpass.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.248
Oh, yes, I recall.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.709
He couldn't deliver
on promises made.

12:32.334 --> 12:34.420
You may also recall
that he was my predecessor.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.464
When I joined Copperhead,
you got what you wanted.

12:36.672 --> 12:37.923
You'll get Scylla, too.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.051
If I don't,

12:41.135 --> 12:44.972
I'll peel you
like a wet grape.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.766
And the price
is one hundred.

12:46.849 --> 12:47.892
One fifty.

12:49.059 --> 12:52.396
One twenty five.
Don't disappoint me.

12:59.487 --> 13:03.657
Well, a hundred
and twenty five...

13:03.741 --> 13:04.742
Million.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.661
Well, then,

13:07.745 --> 13:09.330
Susan, Gretchen,
whatever your name is,

13:09.413 --> 13:12.082
I suggest you find a way
to bury the hatchet

13:12.166 --> 13:14.084
with Michael Scofield's woman.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.212
We got work to do.

13:26.847 --> 13:29.391
Why do I get the feeling
that some poor bastard woke up

13:29.475 --> 13:30.684
to an empty driveway
this morning?

13:30.768 --> 13:33.062
Relax, we got it
from a scrap yard.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.563
And you're pinning the hopes

13:34.647 --> 13:36.398
of the entire mission
on that relic?

13:36.482 --> 13:38.359
If it was card one,
I'd say no.

13:38.442 --> 13:39.568
If this was card five,

13:39.652 --> 13:41.237
I'd say no,
but it's the last card.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.030
I really think we can stage
a hit-and-run

13:43.113 --> 13:44.448
and get away with it.

13:46.283 --> 13:49.453
All right, we know
where this guy works.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.789
We know his route.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.874
I'm gonna wait for him
at this intersection.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.001
He drives through.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.711
I smash him with my car,
get the card.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.631
And if by some miracle
you walked away from the crash,

14:00.714 --> 14:02.299
the General's gonna know
that you ripped him off.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.926
Not if I pump him
full of morphine first.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.928
The General's gonna wake up
tomorrow morning in the hospital

14:06.011 --> 14:08.931
feeling happy as a clam with no
idea what happened to him.

14:09.014 --> 14:09.932
When he's out cold,

14:10.015 --> 14:11.517
we download the card
onto the laptop

14:11.600 --> 14:12.726
and put the original
back on him.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.311
And you don't think
this is gonna look suspicious

14:14.395 --> 14:15.980
for the paramedics that show up
at the scene?

14:16.063 --> 14:18.107
That depends on who
the paramedics are.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.733
At the federal
impound lot downtown,

14:19.817 --> 14:22.278
there are currently four
ambulances seized

14:22.361 --> 14:24.071
in a drug-smuggling ring.

14:24.154 --> 14:25.781
All we need
is one.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.324
Go make yourself useful.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.206
Time was commanders would
assemble their troops

14:34.290 --> 14:38.586
before a battle and rehearse
schemes of maneuver

14:38.669 --> 14:43.048
on a square of dirt using rocks
to depict enemy positions.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.510
They called these rehearsals
"rock drills."

14:47.887 --> 14:51.432
Laos was our rock drill. Now...

14:52.474 --> 14:54.810
it's time for the battle
to commence.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.980
Griffin.

14:58.063 --> 15:01.108
Flooding the Laotian market
with counterfeit kip

15:01.191 --> 15:02.484
was highly effective.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.529
In Phase Two, the effect
will take longer,

15:05.613 --> 15:09.283
but the result will inevitably
be the same.

15:10.284 --> 15:13.120
I'm signing off on the order
to open up

15:13.203 --> 15:14.914
the next theater of operations.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.878
Excuse me.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.761
The message is
untraceable.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.138
Someone went
to a lot of trouble

15:31.221 --> 15:32.765
to cover their tracks.

15:34.391 --> 15:37.227
How do we know this person
can deliver the brothers?

15:37.645 --> 15:38.687
We don't.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.191
Bait the hook.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.442
See if he bites.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.372
Hey-hey, my friend!

15:56.455 --> 15:57.289
Who the hell are you?

15:57.373 --> 15:59.792
Don Self, Homeland Security.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.086
Phil Stroger.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.504
How's it going?
Good.

16:03.587 --> 16:04.838
This is a grande.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.298
This thing cost me
nine bucks.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.926
You California types
and your gourmet coffee.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.386
Hey, can I help you
with something?

16:10.469 --> 16:13.931
This is a federal
impound lot, correct?

16:14.014 --> 16:15.224
Yeah.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.726
Okay, I think it's pretty
obvious, Phil, I need a car.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.714
So you told Sara about
the nosebleeds, huh?

16:46.797 --> 16:47.923
I'm worried about you.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.008
Well, why don't you stop

16:49.091 --> 16:50.300
starting fires
that I have to put out?

16:50.384 --> 16:52.011
Mom couldn't outrun this.
What makes you think you...?

16:52.094 --> 16:54.304
It's not Mom, all right?
That was twenty years ago.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.932
This is different.
It's totally different.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.567
Get in.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.779
So my section chief comes over
to the rookie's stretcher

17:10.863 --> 17:14.074
and he goes, "You got
one hell of a workman's comp claim, kid."

17:16.827 --> 17:19.246
Hey, uh, let's get
that trip ticket started.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.581
Looks like I can
hook you up

17:20.664 --> 17:22.332
with a sedan
for your stakeout.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.544
You know what, Phil?
I gotta go.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.254
What are you talking about?

17:27.337 --> 17:28.505
I just remembered.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.090
I got to give a briefing
to a bunch of higher-ups.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.134
Can I come back
for the sedan?

17:32.217 --> 17:33.635
Suit yourself, Self.

17:36.346 --> 17:37.848
I'll be back.

17:40.768 --> 17:41.810
Don Self.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.562
I need you
to deliver a message.

17:44.772 --> 17:45.689
Okay.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.116
I see your boyfriend's
no longer sporting

17:56.200 --> 18:00.287
the latest fashion
in GPS technology.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.498
So, if neither one of you
are wearing ankle monitors,

18:02.581 --> 18:03.957
what are you still
doing here?

18:04.041 --> 18:05.501
You should be having
hot fugitive sex

18:05.584 --> 18:07.461
in every cash only
no-tell motel

18:07.544 --> 18:08.545
from here to Mexico.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.713
Some things are more important

18:09.797 --> 18:12.716
than what two people want,
Roland.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.219
I honestly hope that someday
that makes sense to you.

18:17.805 --> 18:18.806
Look, Sara...

18:21.809 --> 18:22.893
I'm sorry.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.608
For Vegas.

18:33.904 --> 18:34.905
I'm sorry for Vegas.

18:45.749 --> 18:47.000
- Hello?
- Listen, I have a message

18:47.084 --> 18:48.460
for you from Gretchen.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.671
She wants to meet with you
tonight at 7:00PM.

18:50.754 --> 18:51.797
at the Safari Motel

18:51.880 --> 18:54.299
Room 109.
Why?

18:54.383 --> 18:55.759
She says she wants
to clear the air,

18:55.843 --> 18:56.969
whatever that means.

19:05.602 --> 19:06.603
Sara?

19:08.147 --> 19:09.439
I'm not interested.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.527
Okay.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.696
I got a bad feeling
about this.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.199
I'm the one on point.
You're in the ambulance.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.701
Why are you
so worried?

19:21.285 --> 19:22.578
I just got a feeling.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.329
If anything should happen,

19:24.413 --> 19:26.540
call my mom in Chicago.

19:26.623 --> 19:29.418
Tell her I didn't die
like a damn convict

19:29.501 --> 19:31.003
locked up
in some penitentiary.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.629
Nothing's gonna happen.

19:46.768 --> 19:47.936
You ready for this?

19:48.020 --> 19:50.272
Yeah. Me and Sucre
got this.

19:50.731 --> 19:51.773
I know you do.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.318
Good luck.

19:58.655 --> 19:59.740
All right.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.247
I'm in position.

20:49.539 --> 20:51.250
Good. The rest of us
are standing by

20:51.333 --> 20:52.501
at the intersection.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.134
No one's expecting you

21:01.218 --> 21:03.345
to actually treat
this bastard, right?

21:04.054 --> 21:05.722
Yeah, I'm still a doctor.

21:08.642 --> 21:10.602
Sucre, how you guys doing?

21:16.108 --> 21:17.609
Sucre?

21:18.777 --> 21:20.237
Got to be kidding me.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.738
Sucre, you there?

21:22.864 --> 21:23.865
We're good.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.166
Being as I was the
original recipient

21:33.250 --> 21:35.585
of the late
Mr. Whistler's artwork...

21:37.296 --> 21:38.380
What's my cut?

21:42.634 --> 21:43.760
$25 million.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.265
Just so you know,

21:48.348 --> 21:51.268
I have a very keen
sense of ownership.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.478
Six headstones

21:53.562 --> 21:57.566
in Coosa County Cemetery
can attest to that fact.

21:57.858 --> 22:00.319
The names on those
grave markers

22:00.402 --> 22:04.197
took a six pack of Schlitz
I had cooling in the river.

22:04.614 --> 22:07.367
That particular transgression
put me back five bucks.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.120
Imagine what I'd do
for $25 million.

22:10.787 --> 22:11.913
You'll get your cut.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.332
But you're gonna earn it.

22:14.958 --> 22:16.084
And how much of that payday

22:16.168 --> 22:18.170
is Scofield and
his crew earning?

22:18.253 --> 22:20.297
Oh, I doubt they'll be around
to collect.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.675
There's a lot of blood
being spilled

22:23.759 --> 22:24.885
and a lot of money being

22:24.968 --> 22:27.137
offered up for just
a little old black book.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.640
What's so funny?

22:30.724 --> 22:32.100
That everyone thinks
that Scylla

22:32.184 --> 22:34.311
is just the Company's
little black book.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.289
Hey, buddy.

23:39.876 --> 23:41.795
I understand from Lincoln
your mom had a hamartoma

23:41.878 --> 23:43.922
in her right frontal lobe.

23:48.510 --> 23:49.469
That's right.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.181
When a tumor like that gets
large enough to be problematic,

23:53.265 --> 23:55.267
it's gonna come with
a lot of symptoms.

23:55.350 --> 23:56.852
Loss of short-term memory,

23:56.935 --> 23:58.061
problems with your depth
perception,

23:58.145 --> 24:00.355
problems with your motor skills.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.356
If you had anything like that,

24:01.440 --> 24:03.400
you'd let me know.
Yes, but I haven't.

24:03.483 --> 24:04.818
And I won't.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.445
And I'm fine.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.084
Michael.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.171
The General is leaving.

24:25.797 --> 24:28.717
The General is leaving.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.385
All right,
everybody get ready.

24:41.396 --> 24:42.230
You doing all right?

24:42.314 --> 24:45.734
Fine. Just not so good
around blood is all.

24:45.817 --> 24:46.860
I'll take care
of the messy part,

24:46.943 --> 24:48.320
you just help me
get him on the gurney.

24:59.372 --> 25:01.833
Doesn't take two people
to crash a car, you know.

25:04.419 --> 25:05.253
You're kidding me, right?

25:05.337 --> 25:07.631
After all I've been
through with you?

25:07.714 --> 25:08.965
Now you're worried about my ass?

25:12.010 --> 25:13.261
Shut up and drive, okay?

25:13.345 --> 25:14.221
Buckle up.

25:24.648 --> 25:25.815
What is it?

25:25.899 --> 25:28.235
Linc, we got him.
He's two blocks away from you.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.736
We're on it.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.154
Here we go.

25:44.876 --> 25:45.961
What's he doing?

25:46.044 --> 25:46.962
Something's wrong.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.588
He's turning around.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.465
Linc, pull back!
It's a trap.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.550
Let's get out of here.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.309
Sucre!
Sucre, get down!

26:01.393 --> 26:03.520
Get us out of here, Linc!
Keep your head down!

26:03.603 --> 26:04.479
Faster!

26:04.563 --> 26:06.940
Hang on! Hang on!

26:07.983 --> 26:09.734
You all right?

26:09.818 --> 26:11.069
Damn, you're hit!

26:34.384 --> 26:36.845
Stay with us, Fernando.
You're going to be all right.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.680
He came
straight at us. We were set up.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.765
So you're saying
that they knew we were going to be there?

26:40.849 --> 26:41.975
Then they know
about this place.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.018
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.185
Brad, I'm gonna need
some gauze.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.604
Somebody could be
coming here right now.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.606
If they knew about this place,
we'd already be dead.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.399
What about that
Gretchen chick?

26:49.482 --> 26:51.526
She's got a couple of pages from
Whistler's bird book.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.403
It doesn't make her psychic.

26:53.486 --> 26:54.779
Brad, I need some gauze.

27:25.226 --> 27:27.354
Well, it looks like
someone set us up.

27:27.437 --> 27:29.189
Seriously?
Yeah.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.441
And I'm wondering
if it was you.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.403
Okay, first you give me
the leper treatment,

27:35.487 --> 27:36.488
and now I'm a traitor

27:36.571 --> 27:37.906
-is that right?
-Come on, Roland, who else

27:37.989 --> 27:39.491
could've known we were going to be
at that intersection?

27:39.574 --> 27:40.909
You know what,
just because I didn't

27:40.992 --> 27:42.243
do time with you guys,
it doesn't make me a rat.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.621
All right?
I put just as much into this job

27:44.704 --> 27:45.664
as anybody else.

27:45.747 --> 27:46.748
Okay, I make
one little mistake

27:46.831 --> 27:47.791
and all of a sudden
I'm Judas?

27:47.874 --> 27:49.292
No, you know what?
You know, no.

27:49.376 --> 27:51.961
Call Self, okay, because...
because I'm gonna go back

27:52.045 --> 27:53.088
to the can.
I'm done with this...

27:53.171 --> 27:55.924
All right, just
calm down. Calm down.

27:56.716 --> 27:57.634
I want you to look up

27:57.717 --> 27:59.135
all the local businesses
at the corner

27:59.219 --> 28:00.261
of King and Willow.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.430
I need the ones
with exterior security cameras,

28:02.514 --> 28:04.265
'cause I'm looking for
a license plate number,

28:04.349 --> 28:05.392
all right?

28:09.479 --> 28:11.022
How about an apology?

28:18.947 --> 28:20.156
Where the hell is Scofield?

28:20.240 --> 28:22.617
We've been waiting for him
to break ground all day.

28:22.701 --> 28:23.827
He's taking care
of one last thing.

28:23.910 --> 28:24.994
He'll be here
in the morning.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.871
And Sara, what'd she say
about our meeting?

28:26.955 --> 28:28.957
She's not interested.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.292
Okay, well, if she changes
her mind, I'll be there.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.502
Just so everyone knows,

28:32.585 --> 28:34.629
this is Sara's last
chance to settle up.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.339
I want all the grievances
out on the table

28:36.423 --> 28:37.424
so we can move forward.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.302
Listen to me, skank.

28:41.386 --> 28:42.470
You just got your stripes

28:42.554 --> 28:44.180
ripped off your sleeve
by your old boss.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.516
So whatever clout you had
with the Company,

28:46.599 --> 28:47.559
it's gone.

28:47.642 --> 28:48.977
You work for me now.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.229
So you can try to pull rank
on the hick here

28:51.312 --> 28:52.230
all you want,

28:52.313 --> 28:54.190
but don't mistake my patience
for weakness.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.651
You're alive right now
for one reason:

28:56.735 --> 28:58.194
because I'm allowing
you to be.

28:59.279 --> 29:00.363
So when I get Scylla,

29:00.447 --> 29:01.573
you'll get your
traveling money.

29:01.656 --> 29:02.699
And when this is over,

29:02.782 --> 29:04.367
if you step one foot

29:04.451 --> 29:06.327
on American soil,
I'm gonna take

29:06.411 --> 29:07.328
this gun...

29:09.622 --> 29:13.001
and I'm gonna put a bullet
right there.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.214
And that goes for
you, too, Gummo.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.383
Are we clear?

29:20.467 --> 29:21.718
We're clear.

29:30.393 --> 29:32.103
Here. I made this.

29:33.271 --> 29:34.230
It's a chart of all

29:34.314 --> 29:35.315
the people coming in and out
of the office,

29:35.398 --> 29:38.151
showing which times of the day
are the busiest

29:38.234 --> 29:39.694
and which are best
for digging.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.823
Just answer the phones.

29:49.329 --> 29:50.538
I'll handle this.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.670
- Did you get it?
- Hold on.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.464
Hurry up.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.218
Why are we doing this again?

30:03.301 --> 30:05.178
It's an insurance policy.

30:05.553 --> 30:08.515
If she tries to get out
of that big Scylla payday.

30:09.265 --> 30:10.558
How big of a payday?

30:11.392 --> 30:13.102
One million dollars.

30:17.649 --> 30:18.983
You put a gun on me again,

30:19.067 --> 30:21.027
and these aren't the only set
of prints I'll be copying.

30:21.110 --> 30:23.947
From this moment on,
we are allies.

30:24.322 --> 30:25.406
She watching?

30:25.490 --> 30:26.449
Yes.

30:27.325 --> 30:28.243
Brace yourself.

30:28.326 --> 30:29.244
For what?

30:29.702 --> 30:30.829
Don't you ever

30:30.912 --> 30:33.373
come in my office again
unless you're summoned!

30:42.090 --> 30:43.758
Burrows was in the car.

30:43.925 --> 30:46.344
It appears our source
is dependable.

30:46.427 --> 30:49.514
When I said bait the hook,
I did not mean with me.

30:49.597 --> 30:51.224
They came that close
to killing me.

30:51.307 --> 30:52.809
I wouldn't let that happen.

30:54.435 --> 30:56.646
But if you're unhappy
with my methods,

30:57.814 --> 31:00.149
maybe you should parcel out
the job to someone else.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.277
I don't accept resignations.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.862
Close the deal
with the mystery man

31:03.945 --> 31:05.488
and bring the brothers
to me today

31:05.572 --> 31:07.866
or your severance pay
will be a body bag.

31:07.949 --> 31:11.369
Broad daylight, city street,
and they knew your route.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.162
If Scofield's mission

31:13.246 --> 31:14.414
was to kill you,

31:15.290 --> 31:16.916
he'd have a better
way to do it.

31:24.507 --> 31:25.967
You have
everything you need?

31:26.467 --> 31:27.594
Yeah. I'm good.

31:28.803 --> 31:30.471
You're gonna be
just fine.

31:32.765 --> 31:34.517
Almost done. Breathe.

31:37.729 --> 31:38.897
There you go.

31:40.106 --> 31:42.734
I would've died on this table
if it weren't for you, Doc.

31:42.817 --> 31:44.527
Mm-hmm. Just wait till
you get my bill.

31:44.611 --> 31:45.862
Hang in there, Sucre.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.114
Even if the warehouse ain't
on the Company's radar,

31:48.197 --> 31:49.490
we sure as hell are.

31:50.033 --> 31:52.035
- This job's over.
- You don't know that.

31:52.118 --> 31:54.162
I ain't going back to
Fox River, I know that.

31:54.245 --> 31:55.788
What do you think
Self is gonna do

31:55.872 --> 31:57.415
when he finds out
the Company made us?

31:59.125 --> 32:00.835
We're about to find out.

32:00.919 --> 32:01.961
Yeah?

32:02.045 --> 32:03.463
Hey, where the hell
is Roland?

32:03.546 --> 32:05.340
His GPS just went off-line.

32:44.754 --> 32:45.838
Well?

32:45.922 --> 32:47.340
Took the Corolla.

32:49.884 --> 32:52.136
He take his laptop, too?
Yeah.

32:52.345 --> 32:53.721
Alex.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.065
You doing okay?

33:04.148 --> 33:05.942
-How much longer, Doc?
-Almost.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.904
Hey, you got this covered?

33:09.988 --> 33:11.990
What are you
still doing here?

33:12.073 --> 33:13.616
Go get the son of a bitch.

33:17.787 --> 33:18.746
All done.

34:20.516 --> 34:21.559
You got my money?

34:25.438 --> 34:26.647
Oh, yo, I thought this

34:26.731 --> 34:28.399
was going to be a legit
business transaction, okay?

34:28.483 --> 34:29.484
You don't got my money,
I don't got

34:29.567 --> 34:31.235
the location of the brothers.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.612
Where are they?

34:34.489 --> 34:35.531
Oh, God!

34:35.615 --> 34:37.867
What are you doing?!
What are you doing?!

35:20.910 --> 35:22.245
Sara...

35:30.962 --> 35:32.296
Hello, Sara.

35:39.512 --> 35:43.015
A former mentor of mine
once told me a story

35:43.099 --> 35:45.434
that I think applies
to this situation.

35:45.518 --> 35:47.520
At the end of the Civil War,
Grant's Union Army

35:47.603 --> 35:51.190
had Lee's Confederate soldiers
outflanked at Appomattox.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.526
Lee understood the futility
of more bloodshed,

35:53.609 --> 35:55.695
so he requested
a cease-fire.

35:55.778 --> 35:57.947
He wanted to bring an end
to the fighting.

35:58.030 --> 36:00.199
Soldiers that had been killing
each other that morning,

36:00.283 --> 36:02.160
walked across the
lines that afternoon

36:02.243 --> 36:03.244
for the first
time as allies

36:03.327 --> 36:06.330
to trade Northern coffee
for Southern tobacco.

36:06.414 --> 36:08.499
Now, I don't expect us
to exchange gifts,

36:08.583 --> 36:11.335
but that doesn't mean
we can't be allies.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.054
Of course, you can't have
a cease-fire

36:22.138 --> 36:23.139
without both parties

36:23.222 --> 36:24.432
getting what they want.

36:39.155 --> 36:41.240
You have five minutes.

36:41.324 --> 36:43.534
Put as many scars
on my back as possible.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.811
I don't want to rush you,
but you have four minutes left.

37:11.687 --> 37:12.939
What was her name?

37:13.022 --> 37:14.565
This is a one-time
deal, Sara.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.734
You want your pound of
flesh, you take it now.

37:16.817 --> 37:18.110
What was her name?

37:18.194 --> 37:19.528
Who?
The guard--

37:19.612 --> 37:21.280
the one you shot
and left to die in my arms.

37:21.364 --> 37:22.949
That's what
this is about?

37:23.032 --> 37:24.742
A guard that couldn't
do her job?

37:27.912 --> 37:29.247
What was her name?

37:37.296 --> 37:38.881
What was her name?

37:40.758 --> 37:41.634
Taylor.

37:41.717 --> 37:42.718
Her first name?

37:44.053 --> 37:45.680
Michelle... I think.

37:46.597 --> 37:49.058
You should know that
this isn't about me.

37:49.141 --> 37:50.977
I can handle the scars
you put on my back,

37:51.060 --> 37:52.228
but what you
did to Michelle...

37:52.311 --> 37:54.021
I had orders. She tried
to help you escape.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.982
She did help me escape.
She didn't try.

38:02.863 --> 38:04.282
Sara...

38:12.373 --> 38:14.083
You were too busy making
an example out of her

38:14.166 --> 38:15.501
to find the key
that she left with me.

38:15.918 --> 38:17.920
Then she got what
she deserved.

38:23.551 --> 38:24.969
She saved my life.

38:28.347 --> 38:29.640
And you took hers.

38:31.058 --> 38:32.143
You proved
your point.

38:33.894 --> 38:35.104
We're even.

38:37.023 --> 38:38.691
We're a long way from even.

38:39.734 --> 38:41.902
And when this is over,
you'll pay for Michelle.

38:48.075 --> 38:49.452
Where are they?

38:54.498 --> 38:57.418
The thing about a gunshot
to the kneecap...

38:58.085 --> 38:59.837
it takes days
to die from it.

39:01.505 --> 39:04.050
Now, if I were
to shoot you, let's say,

39:04.133 --> 39:05.051
here...

39:05.259 --> 39:07.219
the hollow point
would tumble through you

39:07.303 --> 39:09.764
leaving white-hot slivers
in your insides,

39:09.847 --> 39:13.017
causing unimaginable pain.

39:13.100 --> 39:16.103
Only ending when you bled
out on this pavement.

39:16.937 --> 39:18.397
You don't want
that, do you?

39:23.110 --> 39:25.071
Then tell me where
the brothers are.

39:26.447 --> 39:28.366
They're in a warehouse.

39:28.449 --> 39:30.618
Pier 31, San Pedro--
they're all there.

39:31.285 --> 39:32.328
Please...

39:33.704 --> 39:35.081
Thank you.

39:36.624 --> 39:37.583
No!

39:37.666 --> 39:38.501
What are you doing?!

39:38.584 --> 39:41.337
I told you what
you wanted...!

39:54.558 --> 39:55.810
No, no...

39:55.893 --> 39:56.894
No!

40:04.485 --> 40:05.778
All right, all right!

40:10.533 --> 40:12.076
Enough.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.619
You'll get your shot.
Now back off.

40:13.702 --> 40:14.912
Alex, listen to him.

40:14.995 --> 40:17.498
Hey, hey, you'll get
your shot, man.

40:17.706 --> 40:19.083
You'll get your shot.

40:20.209 --> 40:21.585
Michael, come on.
He sold us out.

40:21.669 --> 40:22.586
What are you doing?

40:23.170 --> 40:24.547
We got to go.

40:50.656 --> 40:52.700
Wait... wait...

40:53.701 --> 40:55.327
Wait...

40:55.411 --> 40:56.871
Michael, let's go.

41:09.425 --> 41:12.303
Don't hand me
any more updates.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.725
They're surveilling me.

41:18.934 --> 41:20.436
They're coming after me.

41:21.395 --> 41:22.771
General, we'll get them.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.315
This isn't the
first time someone's

41:24.398 --> 41:25.524
made an attempt
on your life.

41:25.608 --> 41:28.235
This is not an attempt
on my life.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.654
This is an attempt
on my card.

41:34.825 --> 41:36.076
Get Wyatt.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.328
We're trying
to contact him.

41:37.411 --> 41:38.829
Don't try anything--
just get Wyatt!

41:39.622 --> 41:40.873
How do you
want to proceed?

41:41.457 --> 41:42.374
I want it moved.

41:42.458 --> 41:44.418
To make the necessary
arrangements for security

41:44.502 --> 41:45.544
would take days.

41:45.628 --> 41:47.546
I don't care
about logistics.

41:47.630 --> 41:49.131
I want it moved.

41:49.715 --> 41:51.467
Move Scylla.

41:52.301 --> 41:53.260
Now!

42:07.816 --> 42:09.109
I'm sorry...

42:12.738 --> 42:15.449
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:15.533 --> 42:16.867
I know.

42:19.245 --> 42:20.371
I know.

42:21.497 --> 42:23.999
I'm not ready to go, man.
