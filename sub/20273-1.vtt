00:31.131 --> 00:33.632
I'm here to retrieve
the hornet device.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.034
Hand it over quietly...

00:35.036 --> 00:38.637
And you boys will live
to powder your boss' wig
in the morning.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.340
Very amusing...

00:54.320 --> 00:56.722
...but quite ill advised.

00:56.724 --> 01:01.026
For you see this facility
is crawling with my men...

01:01.028 --> 01:02.661
And you...

01:02.663 --> 01:05.164
You are quite far
from the hornet device.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.732
I see.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.667
Well, my mistake.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.836
Uh, good luck with
the whole Genesis thing...

01:10.838 --> 01:12.071
See you later.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.472
Neil stryker...

01:13.474 --> 01:15.340
...your days are numbered.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.009
Make it quick boys!

01:20.046 --> 01:22.781
Don't be a afraid,
gentlemen!

01:22.783 --> 01:24.817
He's just a boy!

01:29.856 --> 01:32.825
Yah! Yah! Ah!

01:57.717 --> 02:00.419
Let go of him,
he's getting married next week.

02:08.695 --> 02:11.663
Yah! Yah! Yah!

02:12.565 --> 02:14.666
She's just a girl, stryker...

02:14.668 --> 02:16.702
Having problems?

02:19.472 --> 02:20.672
Ah!

02:44.464 --> 02:46.098
As agile as ever.

02:47.734 --> 02:50.736
But you're as dangerous
as you are stupid!

02:50.738 --> 02:52.171
My dear boy...

02:53.139 --> 02:56.575
...have you forgot you
foolhardy days at school

02:56.577 --> 02:59.211
when I'd spank your bare bottom?

02:59.213 --> 03:00.445
Neil stryker...

03:01.447 --> 03:04.716
...you've always been the fly
in my ointment.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.619
I've waited a long time
for this.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.655
I'm really going to enjoy--

03:20.200 --> 03:21.633
<i> stryker, come in!</i>

03:21.635 --> 03:22.734
What's up, chief?

03:22.736 --> 03:23.735
<i> Status report.</i>

03:23.737 --> 03:25.437
Mission accomplished.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.939
Hornet device secure.

03:26.941 --> 03:29.341
<i> Remember, we're taking</i>
<i> the commodore alive!</i>

03:29.343 --> 03:32.444
Now, when you save alive...

04:13.052 --> 04:14.720
Turn the lights on, please.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.221
Uh, sure.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.091
Says here that when they
brought him in

04:20.094 --> 04:22.828
he was wearing some sort
of protective eyewear.

04:22.830 --> 04:23.562
Maybe...

04:24.564 --> 04:26.832
Could we have
his protective eyewear, please?

04:26.834 --> 04:28.233
Ok, yeah.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.785
Gentlemen...

04:46.787 --> 04:52.057
You must accept my most Sincere
apology for my behavior.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.558
It's my eyes.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.728
They're extremely sensitive
to the light.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.530
Allow me
to express my gratitude.

04:59.799 --> 05:03.268
Imagine yourself, oh,
years from now,

05:03.270 --> 05:05.904
looking back at a life
of precious memories

05:05.906 --> 05:09.808
which you'll surely Cherish for
another ten or twenty more.

05:09.810 --> 05:14.279
But then you stop and realize
that these memories
don't exist yet.

05:14.281 --> 05:16.915
Life is one thing
and one thing only.

05:16.917 --> 05:21.153
That being the very moment
that stands before you now.

05:21.155 --> 05:25.490
Each passing second delivering
your fate to your front door
like a steam engine

05:25.492 --> 05:28.327
traveling faster and faster
until the counting seconds

05:28.329 --> 05:30.395
have reached their end.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.405
Are they dead?

05:42.075 --> 05:43.475
Once again...

05:43.477 --> 05:45.577
...your cunning proves priceless
my lord.

05:45.579 --> 05:48.113
Now, just hold still
and we'll get you out of here.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.781
Uh... now, darrel,

05:49.783 --> 05:51.817
I trust you've taken care
of those things?

05:52.685 --> 05:54.453
Oh, yes.

05:54.455 --> 05:57.222
I've replaced the video feed
with a recording of you

05:57.224 --> 05:59.157
at your last years' evaluation.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.960
There's no need to fret,
your grace.

06:01.962 --> 06:05.263
This assessment is going
as well as the last.

06:19.579 --> 06:20.579
How we doin'?

06:20.581 --> 06:22.948
My lord, we are synchronized...

06:22.950 --> 06:23.982
Perfectly.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.519
All we need do is wait.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.924
And... it's... Christmas.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.028
After you.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.264
<i> Danke schoen!</i>

06:49.342 --> 06:50.375
Hi.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.702
Keep it moving, ladies.

07:19.839 --> 07:22.007
Your grace please...

07:22.009 --> 07:23.542
It'll be just a moment.

07:29.782 --> 07:30.882
Evening, Carl.

07:30.884 --> 07:30.882
Hey, darrel.

07:30.884 --> 07:35.220
Listen, I'm just gonna
play it straight with you, Carl,
because you know what?

07:35.222 --> 07:36.221
You're my kind of guy.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.956
I need to get prisoner 113

07:37.958 --> 07:41.560
into this transport evac
immediately.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.862
Otherwise the higher-ups are
really going to have my hide.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.831
Well, you can have it but...

07:45.833 --> 07:47.666
Nurse is back there cleaning up
a little accident.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.968
You know how ladies can be
on a long trip.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.304
So, uh..
What's up with the suit?

07:52.306 --> 07:54.639
Oh, this little guy?
Well...

07:54.641 --> 07:57.008
Afterwards I gotta...
Head to a funeral.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.877
Funeral? Whose funeral?

08:00.112 --> 08:01.213
Yours.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.733
I see you've decided to join us.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.002
Are you ready to behave?

08:24.004 --> 08:27.172
Or do I have to
bash you one again?

08:28.674 --> 08:30.876
Well good.
I'm sorry, your name?

08:31.944 --> 08:33.410
Sharon.

08:33.413 --> 08:34.679
Sharon,
you're in terrible danger.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.249
We're terrible people,
we're awful people.

08:37.251 --> 08:40.051
Fear us. You should fear us.
Fear us!

08:40.053 --> 08:41.285
Frightened.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.854
Be frightened of us.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.757
To the back of the ship please.

08:45.759 --> 08:46.825
The back.

08:47.393 --> 08:49.928
Get out of my sight.
I don't want to see ya.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.229
Alright, darrel.

08:51.231 --> 08:54.566
Conduct us
to the new hidden fortress.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.067
Coordinates have
been calculated.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.869
We are on our way.

09:01.974 --> 09:03.875
What is our next
course of action?

09:05.545 --> 09:06.678
Kill...

09:06.680 --> 09:07.746
Neil...

09:07.748 --> 09:08.914
Stryker!

09:31.270 --> 09:33.905
Hey, stryker. How ya doin'?

09:33.907 --> 09:37.809
How, uh, how are things goin'
on your little suspension there?

09:37.811 --> 09:39.811
Probably getting a little
restless, I suppose.

09:41.981 --> 09:43.381
Well, um...

09:43.383 --> 09:45.350
Listen, that leads me
to my next uh...

09:45.352 --> 09:46.551
<i> Problemo.</i>

09:46.553 --> 09:47.619
I'm listening.

09:48.754 --> 09:52.190
The mad scientist has escaped
from the mt. Ward asylum.

10:00.866 --> 10:03.568
I thought you told me
there was no way
that could ever happen.

10:03.570 --> 10:06.838
Right. Right. I did.
Yeah. I did.

10:06.840 --> 10:07.839
Listen.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.808
There was somebody
working on the inside.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.977
What could I do, ok?
Take a look at this guy.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.612
Darrel freeway.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.046
His parents must have hated him.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.215
Yeah, he looks like the type
of scum that would team up

10:17.217 --> 10:18.783
with the mad scientist.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.218
He just killed three men

10:20.220 --> 10:21.920
and he took
a woman nurse hostage.

10:21.922 --> 10:22.988
Ok?

10:22.990 --> 10:26.658
You're the only one that can
save the day on this one.
What do you say?

10:28.662 --> 10:30.161
Bullshit.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.964
- No! Stryker,
don't do this to me!
- I'll get back to ya.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.601
Your son is failing
the kindergarten.

10:36.603 --> 10:38.236
Did you look at his grades?

10:39.271 --> 10:42.173
No, Barb. I did not
look at his grades.

10:44.043 --> 10:46.778
No shit, ya fuckin' loser!

10:46.780 --> 10:51.149
'Cause you were fucking off
up on the roof
doing nothin' important!

10:51.151 --> 10:53.818
I'm stapling in
the holiday lights, Barbara.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.055
That's about as important
as it gets.

10:58.257 --> 11:02.260
No wonder our son
is a goddamn failure.

11:02.262 --> 11:05.363
He takes after an old bastard
who can't keep his job

11:05.365 --> 11:07.399
and spends his time
fuckin' on the roof!

11:23.482 --> 11:24.883
Listen, Shelly

11:24.885 --> 11:26.618
I'm going to need you to watch
the kid for a little while.

11:30.823 --> 11:33.058
Nah, she can't.
She's dead.

11:35.127 --> 11:37.395
What do you mean
"my stereo is broken"?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.597
Are you sure
it's even plugged in?

11:41.033 --> 11:44.736
Look, I'll be by in half-an-hour
to drop him off, ok?

11:44.738 --> 11:46.037
Good.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.777
This is supposed to be...
Right there.

11:52.779 --> 11:55.246
- Hey there, cowboy.
- Uh-huh?

11:55.248 --> 11:57.182
You ready to go
to your aunt's house?

11:57.184 --> 11:59.451
No, no. Our house.

11:59.453 --> 12:01.252
That's fine.
We'll go in a minute.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.921
Take your time.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.924
Your mother tells me your not
doing very well in school.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.093
Shouldn't you be doing
your homework right now?

12:09.195 --> 12:10.662
No.

12:11.997 --> 12:14.532
How do you expect
to get good grades without
doing your homework?

12:14.534 --> 12:16.768
Homework bites, daddy.

12:17.369 --> 12:19.003
Well, that's true.

12:19.005 --> 12:21.239
Homework definitely
bites the big one.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.674
Daddy?

12:22.676 --> 12:24.509
Yeah, kid?

12:24.511 --> 12:26.311
When's mommy coming back?

12:27.079 --> 12:28.513
Your mother's dead, kid.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.048
I killed her.

12:30.716 --> 12:31.950
I'm just kidding.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.551
But she is dead.

12:41.994 --> 12:43.194
Sir.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.268
Thank you.

12:51.036 --> 12:53.304
Hey, Jack.
- Yes, sir?

12:53.306 --> 12:54.839
What are these anomalies
I'm seeing here?

12:54.841 --> 12:56.040
Unknown, sir.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.776
We've been analyzing it
all morning.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.244
It's funny.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.079
I'm not getting any of that
on my tracker.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.213
Your what, sir?

13:02.215 --> 13:03.581
Never mind.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.717
I'm going gonna make
a pit stop
before I go see Fred.

13:05.719 --> 13:06.985
Jack,

13:06.987 --> 13:08.753
keep your eye on the board.

13:15.327 --> 13:17.328
Hold the lift, buddy.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.563
Thanks.

13:18.565 --> 13:19.798
Any time.

13:25.237 --> 13:27.105
Checking out the uniform, huh?

13:27.107 --> 13:28.706
That's right.

13:28.708 --> 13:32.110
Just got promoted to assassin.
- Great.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.179
I bet you wish you could
have one of these.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.680
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:37.183 --> 13:39.984
Well, all it takes is four years
of hard work and training.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.619
You'll be on your way.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.456
Well, all that's
very impressive.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.759
See you on the field, champ.

13:47.761 --> 13:49.727
Ladies' locker room.

14:22.761 --> 14:23.995
Ouch!

14:25.130 --> 14:27.465
There's a fire in the building,
we all have to evacuate.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.901
What? I didn't hear
any fire alarm!

14:29.903 --> 14:31.836
You're right. There is no fire.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.405
Cool vagina.

14:35.241 --> 14:37.141
Hey, I thought
you were suspended.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.643
Not any more, babe.

14:38.645 --> 14:39.811
So...

14:39.813 --> 14:41.212
What's the big job then?

14:41.214 --> 14:42.881
Must be pretty important...

14:42.883 --> 14:44.916
If they cut
your suspension short.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.050
Must be.

14:46.552 --> 14:47.719
Can I go?

14:47.721 --> 14:50.121
No. The man I'm going after
is too dangerous.

14:51.423 --> 14:52.891
But I'm trained.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.293
You're the one who trained me.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.761
You're not ready.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.463
This job is not
for first-timers.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.532
Don't give me that look.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.738
This job is personal.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.306
Do you understand that?

15:09.241 --> 15:11.910
Look, let me
make you understand.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.746
Before I became an agent,
i used to work
with a brilliant scientist.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.147
One day...

15:17.116 --> 15:19.384
...he went completely mad.

15:40.639 --> 15:43.041
Stryker,
you gotta come see this!

16:38.030 --> 16:40.798
I've done it, stryker!
I've finally done it!

16:40.800 --> 16:42.467
Your time portal.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.801
So, how does it work?

16:43.803 --> 16:45.903
Well, the portal itself
is currently

16:45.905 --> 16:47.939
ripping through time and space
as we speak.

16:47.941 --> 16:52.477
And I use this to summon
or beckon it, if you will.

16:52.479 --> 16:55.947
So the machine is in
a constant state of time travel.

16:55.949 --> 16:58.016
Not bad.
- Yes, Neil.

16:58.018 --> 17:01.753
And it completely solves
all the stability issues
i was having before.

17:01.755 --> 17:05.022
And that's exactly why
we failed with the time pod.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.824
That fucking thing.

17:15.969 --> 17:18.469
See?
Let me show you how this works.

17:19.304 --> 17:22.240
Now. I am
setting the coordinates

17:22.242 --> 17:24.342
to send me precisely
20 seconds

17:24.344 --> 17:27.244
into the future.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.580
Which will expel me
right back here
to this very spot.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.783
Now, Neil, stand back...

17:31.785 --> 17:33.718
And behold...

17:33.720 --> 17:35.720
The absolute dazzlement...

17:36.622 --> 17:40.758
The unadulterated majesty
of time travel.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.671
Ha ha!

18:06.185 --> 18:10.855
<i> You know, twenty seconds is</i>
<i> a lot longer than you think...</i>

18:10.857 --> 18:12.590
<i> When you're</i>
<i> just standing there...</i>

18:13.892 --> 18:15.393
<i> ...doin' nothin'...</i>

18:16.361 --> 18:17.728
<i> ...like a jerk.</i>

18:23.035 --> 18:25.803
With this new technology...

18:25.805 --> 18:29.440
He possibilities are endless.

18:31.043 --> 18:32.710
<i> He was never</i>
<i> the same after that.</i>

18:32.712 --> 18:35.046
<i> He would stay up</i>
<i> for days devising plans</i>

18:35.048 --> 18:37.715
<i> of world domination</i>
<i> and unspeakable evil.</i>

18:37.717 --> 18:39.383
...operation omega

18:39.385 --> 18:41.219
I know exactly what I'm saying

18:41.221 --> 18:43.387
I've got the perfect plan:

18:43.389 --> 18:48.025
I will go back in time
to every December the 24th...

18:48.027 --> 18:50.728
And I will steal
Santa claus' bag of toys.

18:51.964 --> 18:56.134
And they'll all be mine, leaving
nothing left for the children.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.935
I will be the absolute ruler.

18:58.704 --> 19:01.205
The most certain
king of Christmas.

19:03.108 --> 19:04.775
And to top it all off...

19:05.777 --> 19:09.113
I will breed with Mrs. claus.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.121
I can't let that happen.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.894
<i> Mark my words, stryker...</i>

19:22.896 --> 19:24.462
<i> Revenge!</i>

19:27.065 --> 19:29.467
I'll never forget
the look on his face...

19:29.469 --> 19:31.469
The sound of his voice.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.771
He's out there, Veronica.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.706
The only chance this world has

19:35.708 --> 19:38.376
is is if I find him
before he finds me.

19:40.279 --> 19:42.213
What are you girls doing?!
This is classified information!

19:42.215 --> 19:43.681
Get the hell out of here!

19:46.552 --> 19:48.886
You're still not going with me.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.189
With the mad scientist at large

19:51.191 --> 19:54.892
the entire world as we
know it today is in peril.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.528
I mean... we're fucked!

19:57.530 --> 19:58.963
It's true.

20:00.265 --> 20:02.867
But you are forgetting
one thing, Fred.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.835
Snack machine is broken?

20:05.871 --> 20:07.205
Me.

20:07.839 --> 20:10.241
You broke the snack machine!

20:10.243 --> 20:12.476
I didn't touch
the fucking snack machine!

20:12.478 --> 20:14.979
Let me make you understand.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.681
<i> After the scientist</i>
<i> built the time portal,</i>

20:16.683 --> 20:19.016
<i> I was able to get</i>
<i> my hands on the schematics.</i>

20:19.018 --> 20:21.552
<i> I followed them carefully</i>
<i>and built a time portal tracker</i>

20:21.554 --> 20:24.922
<i> so that I could track any time</i>
<i>the scientist made a time-jump.</i>

20:42.874 --> 20:46.210
You know what I love
about the French, stryker?

20:48.280 --> 20:49.747
The hats.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.416
You look like Napoleon.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.085
I know, right?

20:54.087 --> 20:55.453
He gave me the entire getup

20:55.455 --> 20:57.688
for a pair of
invisibility boots.

20:57.690 --> 20:57.688
Now you listen.

20:57.690 --> 21:02.460
You can't give
ancient civilizations
advanced technology like that.

21:02.462 --> 21:05.062
You're going to fuck up
the entire course of history.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.464
What's the matter with you?

21:10.936 --> 21:13.204
I think-i think I know
what I'm doing here, stryker.

21:13.206 --> 21:16.173
If you just take a step back
and ask yourself
what you're asking me

21:16.175 --> 21:18.142
because I know what I'm doing.
I'm a genius. Okay?

21:18.144 --> 21:19.510
Don't fuck with me.

21:24.182 --> 21:25.816
What do you take me for,
stryker?

21:25.818 --> 21:27.251
I invented time travel.

21:27.253 --> 21:29.720
Of course
i know the repercussions
of altering history.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.422
I was the one who--

21:32.724 --> 21:35.559
<i> it was times like these</i>
<i> I knew having the ability</i>

21:35.561 --> 21:37.995
<i> to track</i>
<i> the scientist's time-jumps</i>

21:37.997 --> 21:39.363
<i> would be vital.</i>

21:39.365 --> 21:40.598
<i> But chasing him through time</i>

21:40.600 --> 21:42.533
could be
a catastrophic nightmare.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.535
We have to stop him
before that can happen.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.837
His thirst for revenge
is the only reason

21:46.839 --> 21:48.939
he hasn't already
made a time-jump.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.108
And it's the only
leverage we have.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.081
Where are you hiding?

22:26.912 --> 22:30.548
It didn't take long
to find you, stryker,

22:30.550 --> 22:32.216
and now you're mine.

22:46.565 --> 22:48.733
There's no escape, stryker!

22:49.935 --> 22:52.036
Darrel, prepare
to launch missiles.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.704
Your grace, I must protest.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.773
Those laser beams
did overheat our drives.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.475
We do not want
to blow a fuse by--

22:57.477 --> 23:00.010
get the fuck out of my way!
I'll fucking do it.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.514
Whoa! Darrel!

23:18.063 --> 23:20.464
Your grace, he's still alive.

23:20.466 --> 23:22.466
Of course he is, darrel!

23:22.468 --> 23:24.468
He's always still alive!

23:24.470 --> 23:26.203
But not for long.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.038
Let's see how
he likes a little

23:28.040 --> 23:30.207
visit from one of
our blimp probes.

24:17.522 --> 24:21.292
Stryker, what are you up to?

24:21.294 --> 24:22.626
Darrel...

24:23.028 --> 24:24.428
...take over.

24:38.343 --> 24:40.911
Stryker!
What the hell are you doing?

24:40.913 --> 24:42.112
Oh, no!

24:42.114 --> 24:43.747
Don't you dare
blow up my blimp,

24:43.749 --> 24:45.416
stryker, don't you dare!

24:46.251 --> 24:48.752
Oh, god! My nose!

24:49.554 --> 24:51.222
Don't mind if I do!

24:57.829 --> 24:59.730
Darrel, get to the
fucking escape pod!

25:04.769 --> 25:06.203
Is there something wrong,
my lord?

25:06.205 --> 25:08.172
Yeah, I just got kicked
in the fucking face.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.573
Now get the fuck in there!

25:18.416 --> 25:20.518
Push the fucking button, darrel!

25:20.520 --> 25:21.819
Come on!

25:21.821 --> 25:23.187
Come on!

25:26.925 --> 25:29.727
I'll get you
for this, stryker!

25:42.641 --> 25:44.341
Incoming call

25:45.544 --> 25:46.911
elite forces.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.614
Hey, stryker.
What are you doing?

25:52.083 --> 25:53.617
Following a hunch.

25:54.653 --> 25:56.253
Do we know where
the mad scientist is hiding?

25:56.255 --> 25:57.254
No.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.957
But I think I might
know who does.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.358
That's fucking great.

26:01.927 --> 26:03.460
<i> His twin brother.</i>

26:03.462 --> 26:04.762
<i> He's a recluse.</i>

26:05.297 --> 26:06.897
<i> He lives in Ireland.</i>

26:07.799 --> 26:09.133
<i> I haven't seen him in years.</i>

26:09.135 --> 26:11.068
<i> So I'll have to be</i>
<i> ready for anything.</i>

26:16.141 --> 26:18.676
Tell you what I, uh,
I'll make you a deal.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.511
I will share with you

26:20.513 --> 26:24.782
the location of my
brother's hidden fortress if...

26:24.784 --> 26:27.985
You pose for my next sculpture.

26:27.987 --> 26:29.219
Nude.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.591
That's it. That's all you want?

26:35.828 --> 26:37.361
No.

26:37.363 --> 26:38.829
Agh!

26:38.831 --> 26:40.698
Well, I tell you this much.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.166
Compromise.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.036
I love you in your uniform.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.172
I mean, I like the way
you look in your uniform.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.473
Uh...

26:49.475 --> 26:50.774
Fine.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.509
And if you pull out before
I'm done,

26:52.511 --> 26:54.278
I'm going to get into
my little cruiser ship

26:54.280 --> 26:55.946
and fucking laser blast you.

26:58.049 --> 27:00.884
So, how long is
this going to take?

27:00.886 --> 27:02.686
Oh, no time at all, Neil.

27:02.688 --> 27:04.254
For this one I'm
thinking action.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.490
Hm? Your kicking a bad guy.

27:11.563 --> 27:13.464
Okay, I like it.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.232
Uh. Oh, shit!

27:15.234 --> 27:17.001
There's another bad guy
comin' right at ya!

27:17.003 --> 27:18.369
Kick 'em both.

27:19.537 --> 27:22.039
Uh. Okay, they're startin' to
move on either side of ya.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.607
Kick 'em wider.

27:29.514 --> 27:32.116
Okay, I'm gonna need
you to go a little wider.

27:36.287 --> 27:38.756
Okay, baby, I'm going to
need you to go a little wider.

27:44.095 --> 27:45.596
Okay.

27:45.598 --> 27:46.930
Now.

27:46.932 --> 27:48.432
A little wider.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.205
Now Bob,
we've talked about this.

27:55.207 --> 27:59.343
This isn't gonna go down.
I know how you want it,
Bob, and...

27:59.345 --> 28:00.744
I just don't do that shit.

28:00.746 --> 28:03.414
Okay, okay, fine, god!

28:04.983 --> 28:06.750
Tell ya what...
Why don't you just, um,

28:06.752 --> 28:08.786
whip out your pistol?

28:08.788 --> 28:10.487
Your gun.

28:11.056 --> 28:12.356
Hold your gun.

28:13.191 --> 28:15.125
So what do you want me to do?

28:15.127 --> 28:17.127
Well, I want you
to be Neil stryker.

28:17.129 --> 28:20.264
I want you to, uh, turn me on.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.799
Try this one.

28:28.940 --> 28:33.444
I can't imagine seeing
a more sexy sight...

28:33.446 --> 28:34.678
Ever.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.880
Ever. So you just stay put.

28:38.616 --> 28:41.218
Through the tides of time...

28:42.087 --> 28:45.856
...only a few men have
shaped history.

28:46.858 --> 28:49.893
And tonight,
two men will do it.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.596
What was once soft...

28:53.231 --> 28:54.932
...will soon be hard.

28:56.668 --> 28:59.169
Wait 'til I tell...

29:03.675 --> 29:05.375
Welcome, Neil stryker.

29:06.377 --> 29:07.611
Coffee.

29:07.613 --> 29:09.079
Nuclear weapon armed.

29:09.081 --> 29:12.249
Detonation in 30 seconds.

29:13.551 --> 29:16.353
Detonation in 20 seconds.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.222
Nuclear weapon armed.

29:18.224 --> 29:20.891
Depositing weapon
in carriage.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.559
Nuclear weapon armed.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.828
- Shit.
- Five, four...

29:24.830 --> 29:27.464
- Open the fucking door!
- ...Three, two, one.

29:29.134 --> 29:30.768
Goodbye.

29:36.174 --> 29:37.908
I've gotta get that fixed.

29:56.327 --> 29:58.061
Welcome, captain stryker.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.604
One new message.

30:09.207 --> 30:10.941
<i> You fucking nuked me.</i>

30:11.876 --> 30:13.510
Incoming call.

30:14.946 --> 30:14.945
Commander Fred.

30:14.947 --> 30:20.083
Stryker, what the fuck
are you doin, okay?
We gotta get goin' here.

30:20.085 --> 30:23.987
The last thing I want
is for mad scientist
to anticipate our next move.

30:23.989 --> 30:27.558
Now listen,
I've assembled a team for you
and they're waiting right now.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.493
Fred, you make me sick.

30:29.495 --> 30:30.527
Why?

30:31.629 --> 30:33.897
Listen, if you wanna cut
payroll just lay the guys off.

30:33.899 --> 30:35.566
We wanna give you
all the help we can.

30:35.568 --> 30:37.034
If you need them, fine.

30:37.036 --> 30:40.137
If you don't need them,
i don't give a fudge
what you do with 'em.

30:40.139 --> 30:42.005
As long as you
don't get caught.

30:42.007 --> 30:42.005
Good.

30:42.007 --> 30:46.410
Because if I had to spend
all my time babysitting
a bunch of assholes...

30:46.412 --> 30:47.711
Beretta.

30:47.713 --> 30:49.012
...i might not accomplish
a damn thing.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.447
Okay, perfect.

30:50.449 --> 30:53.417
So, everybody's waiting for you
in sector seven.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.352
And please, stryker,

30:55.354 --> 30:57.287
go easy on the guys, would ya?

30:57.289 --> 31:00.691
It's the least I could do
considering these guys
probably won't survive.

31:00.693 --> 31:02.025
Cartridge empty.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.061
I assume there's
a mission report
you'll want me to read?

31:04.063 --> 31:05.529
No mission report on this one.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.164
Off the books, baby.

31:07.166 --> 31:08.732
Technically,
you're on suspension.

31:08.734 --> 31:10.000
Okay, so...

31:10.002 --> 31:11.435
Stay out of the admiral's way,

31:11.437 --> 31:14.872
because if you get caught
it's your ass...

31:14.874 --> 31:16.673
...and mine.

31:17.442 --> 31:18.976
I'll be careful.

31:24.115 --> 31:26.450
What I need
from you right now...

31:26.452 --> 31:29.319
...is a cup of coffee.
Not that crap
out of the vending machine.

31:29.321 --> 31:32.823
The good coffee like captain
Gomez keeps in his office
under lock and key.

31:32.825 --> 31:35.259
It's a secure office.
You're going
to have to sneak in.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.261
- I can do that.
- Good.

31:37.263 --> 31:38.829
Half a teaspoon
of unfiltered honey.

31:38.831 --> 31:42.065
Stirred left. No cream.
Hop to it!

31:42.067 --> 31:43.533
Yes, sir!

31:44.836 --> 31:46.904
Oh, man!

31:46.906 --> 31:48.472
Johnson!
- Yes, sir?

31:48.474 --> 31:49.606
- Come here.
- Yes, sir!

31:49.608 --> 31:51.475
Stand here like an idiot.
That's an order.

31:51.477 --> 31:52.676
Yes, sir!

31:53.144 --> 31:54.611
Stryker!

31:55.146 --> 31:56.179
Just what do you th--

31:57.015 --> 31:58.215
admiral...

31:58.217 --> 31:59.683
Sir!

31:59.685 --> 32:02.152
It is an honor.

32:03.554 --> 32:05.589
Clean out your desk.
You're fired.

32:08.192 --> 32:09.927
Hold it, soldier.
Lose the glasses

32:09.929 --> 32:11.528
you look like an idiot.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.463
Man, fuck you.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.065
Ham-sandwich-eatin'
mother fucker.

32:16.067 --> 32:17.367
So, your telling me
some madman

32:17.369 --> 32:19.136
is responsible for
causing all this havoc?

32:19.138 --> 32:21.071
I'm telling you
a mad scientist and his Minion

32:21.073 --> 32:22.539
just laid waste to the city.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.574
Worse than this.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.677
He is like lovechild
of Stalin and Hitler.

32:26.679 --> 32:28.378
Yeah, and it can
get messy in there.

32:28.380 --> 32:31.782
There's wolves, mines,
booby traps, barbed wire.

32:31.784 --> 32:33.016
You might want
to cut that hair.

32:33.018 --> 32:34.651
I can help you with that.

32:34.653 --> 32:35.986
I could probably use a trim

32:49.033 --> 32:51.134
good afternoon, gentlemen.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.136
I'm going to get
straight to the point.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.539
This is a suicide mission.

32:55.541 --> 32:58.608
If it were up to me,
you boys wouldn't even be here.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.077
But it's not.

33:00.079 --> 33:02.312
The admiral knows
nothing about it.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.881
We have no support
from headquarters.

33:04.883 --> 33:07.684
Once we leave,
communication is severed

33:07.686 --> 33:09.653
and we're on our own.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.955
Back out now.
It's your last chance.

33:14.359 --> 33:15.592
Lieutenant.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.527
You heard the captain,
rank and file.

33:17.529 --> 33:20.430
Last one to stryker's ship
is a rusty trombone.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.099
Wait.
What's a rusty trombone?

33:22.101 --> 33:23.633
You know,
when you're eating a guys' ass

33:23.635 --> 33:24.835
and you're jerking
him off at the same time?

33:24.837 --> 33:27.671
No. No, fucking way.
I'm outta here.

33:27.673 --> 33:30.307
Wait!
What is rusty trombone?

33:32.276 --> 33:35.912
So you managed
to weasel your way
on the mission, after all.

33:35.914 --> 33:37.848
You must have
a thing for dying.

33:37.850 --> 33:39.383
Maybe so...

33:39.385 --> 33:41.518
But at least I'm not
a rusty trombone!

33:52.830 --> 33:54.331
Uh, rook to king three.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.999
That's checkmate.

33:56.001 --> 33:58.935
At last, you've arrived.
Shall we be off, then?

33:58.937 --> 34:00.971
I don't know how,
but you cheated.

34:02.540 --> 34:05.242
Yes, he's cheating.
Rook cannot move in this way.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.978
Yes it can.
Pretty slow, Veronica.

34:07.980 --> 34:11.514
Forget rusty trombone,
you just made rusty orchestra.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.083
Boys, prepare to take off.

34:13.085 --> 34:15.619
You, I need a co-pilot.
Get up front.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.804
Try not to crash it.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.009
Keep an eye on her, would you?

34:39.011 --> 34:40.543
Yes, sir.

34:46.650 --> 34:48.485
What is this?

34:48.487 --> 34:51.154
The time had come for this
lion cub to shed his mane.

34:52.489 --> 34:55.324
Plus, I think there
might be some barbed wire.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.693
Continue.

34:57.195 --> 34:58.662
Captain.

34:58.664 --> 35:01.398
We are approaching destination.

35:11.409 --> 35:13.977
Alright.
Give us some room to breathe.

35:13.979 --> 35:15.445
Set us down right over there.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.780
Yes, sir.

35:26.891 --> 35:29.059
Hey.

35:29.061 --> 35:30.894
Forgettin' somethin'?

35:30.896 --> 35:32.429
It's time to gather the flock.

35:32.431 --> 35:33.697
Thank the almighty.

35:33.699 --> 35:37.434
Remember... there ain't no
atheists in the foxhole.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.436
Hold my hand.
- What?

35:39.438 --> 35:41.505
J.C., the big guy,
the lamb of god,

35:41.507 --> 35:43.507
you know he died
for our sins on the cross.

35:43.509 --> 35:44.941
Hold my hand.

35:46.177 --> 35:47.611
Let go my hand!

35:47.613 --> 35:50.714
The only sin was not
using that timber for firewood.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.315
No fall in line, asshole.

35:52.317 --> 35:53.717
You two!

35:54.452 --> 35:55.986
Cut that shit.

36:02.627 --> 36:04.027
Go.

36:18.576 --> 36:20.911
You stepped on my
toe back there, but it's cool.

36:25.049 --> 36:26.983
Ring the bell.

36:30.821 --> 36:33.456
Just as I suspect.
No one home.

36:33.458 --> 36:36.092
It is in complete abandon.

36:36.094 --> 36:38.395
We must not abort mission.

36:38.397 --> 36:41.464
We have lost battle, sir.
But not war.

36:42.700 --> 36:45.035
Did you try the door knob?

36:45.037 --> 36:46.503
It is not possible.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.106
Idiot.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.528
The only thing missing
here is Santa claus.

37:41.759 --> 37:42.826
Santa!

37:42.828 --> 37:43.994
Santa!

37:43.996 --> 37:45.295
Ho! Ho! Ho!

37:45.297 --> 37:47.697
Merry Christmas,
my darlings!

37:49.133 --> 37:51.468
Who's been naughty?
Who's been nice?

37:51.470 --> 37:52.969
Me! Me Santa! Me!

37:52.971 --> 37:54.738
Well, which is it?

37:54.740 --> 37:55.905
Nice! Nice!

37:55.907 --> 37:58.842
Ha ha!
Just what I thought.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.647
Brenner stop!

38:03.649 --> 38:05.915
It's a trap.
- Trap?

38:05.917 --> 38:08.718
Nonsense.
It's not a trap...

38:08.720 --> 38:10.420
It's retail.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.422
No way.

38:12.424 --> 38:15.191
We have all sizes.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.827
Darrel! Don't do that!

38:17.829 --> 38:19.329
Where the hell
did you come from?

38:19.331 --> 38:21.031
Well, he's got the shirts, guys.

38:21.033 --> 38:23.867
Stryker, you remember
operation omega.

38:23.869 --> 38:26.836
Well, it went Nova, okay?
Supernova!

38:26.838 --> 38:29.572
I went back in time,
last year's Christmas Eve

38:29.574 --> 38:31.741
and burgled every
Christmas present on the planet

38:31.743 --> 38:32.742
and replaced it with...

38:32.744 --> 38:34.544
This t-shirt.

38:34.546 --> 38:37.781
Long story short,
I'm backed ordered for weeks.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.215
Whoa! They're huge!

38:39.217 --> 38:41.985
How do you think i
bankrolled this whole fortress?

38:41.987 --> 38:45.288
Seriously, I hardly have time
for new designs.

38:45.290 --> 38:46.856
Check out this new model.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.391
Also very popular.

38:48.393 --> 38:49.859
I'll take one of those.

38:51.562 --> 38:53.797
Anyway, stryker, the point is...

38:53.799 --> 38:55.198
Clark, the prisoner.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.466
I'm on to something here.

38:56.468 --> 38:58.368
What do you say?
Partners?

38:58.370 --> 38:59.636
Hey.

38:59.638 --> 39:00.870
Come on!

39:01.238 --> 39:02.505
Come on!

39:03.207 --> 39:04.407
Hey.

39:04.409 --> 39:05.575
One second.

39:06.644 --> 39:07.644
Grab hold.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.179
Come on! Come on!

39:11.315 --> 39:13.583
You're making a big mistake.

39:13.585 --> 39:15.552
You built another time portal.

39:15.554 --> 39:18.021
Looks like you made it
to the north pole.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.823
That's right. I did.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.526
And to top it all off...

39:33.304 --> 39:36.072
I murdered Mrs. claus.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.842
Waste him.

39:42.613 --> 39:43.847
Ah!

39:46.817 --> 39:48.551
Ah!

39:52.256 --> 39:54.090
Hold it!

39:54.092 --> 39:56.192
Wait! No!

39:58.162 --> 39:59.429
Uh.

39:59.431 --> 40:01.297
You got me, stryker.

40:01.299 --> 40:02.766
You got me.

40:02.768 --> 40:03.833
It looks like...

40:03.835 --> 40:05.935
Losers!

40:05.937 --> 40:07.604
Hologram.

40:08.139 --> 40:09.539
Obviously.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.941
Little disappointed
in you, stryker.

40:11.943 --> 40:15.044
Apparently taking you assholes
down is going to be...

40:15.046 --> 40:16.980
...easier than I thought.

40:16.982 --> 40:18.948
Let the games begin.

40:28.292 --> 40:31.861
Oh! Yes, that's right!

40:31.863 --> 40:34.564
I too am a hologram.

40:34.566 --> 40:37.000
No sense wasting
your bullets on me.

40:37.002 --> 40:38.768
I'm not even here.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.503
Where's that blasted key!

40:41.640 --> 40:42.839
Shit!

40:46.678 --> 40:47.844
Hold your fire.

40:51.048 --> 40:52.182
Captain!

40:53.050 --> 40:54.884
Who was that handsome man?

40:54.886 --> 40:56.219
Clark, don't get distracted.

40:57.455 --> 41:01.491
Captain, it's completely
hollow behind this fireplace.

41:01.493 --> 41:02.592
Huh.

41:03.194 --> 41:04.527
I wonder.

41:14.104 --> 41:15.472
All right. Everybody in.

41:16.674 --> 41:17.907
Hey!

41:17.909 --> 41:20.076
Take off those goddamn t-shirts.

41:26.617 --> 41:29.018
So, how many missions
you been on with this guy?

41:29.020 --> 41:30.920
Who? The captain?
- Yeah.

41:30.922 --> 41:33.256
- Plenty, why?
- No reason.

41:34.558 --> 41:37.494
Looks like I'm going to have to
smash through these boards.

41:37.496 --> 41:40.630
Unless captain has a
crowbar in his pants.

41:40.632 --> 41:41.798
Do you?

41:41.800 --> 41:43.466
Have a crowbar in your pants?

41:50.040 --> 41:51.908
I can't feel my legs!

41:56.547 --> 41:59.749
This must be the disintegrator

41:59.751 --> 42:02.318
I ordered to obliterate stryker.

42:02.320 --> 42:05.522
Disinte-what?
My god. It's enormous!

42:05.524 --> 42:09.826
The only thing
you'll be obliterating
with this thing is my wallet!

42:09.828 --> 42:11.995
I mean look at
the size of this thing!

42:11.997 --> 42:13.196
How much was it?

42:13.198 --> 42:16.900
What are you trying to do?
Bury stryker or bankrupt me?

42:16.902 --> 42:19.636
What about my
exploding pumpkins, Darrell?

42:19.638 --> 42:22.505
I wanted exploding pumpkins
littering the entire castle.

42:22.507 --> 42:23.640
I look around me,

42:23.642 --> 42:25.008
and I don't even see a squash.

42:26.243 --> 42:28.945
Your little parlor tricks
aren't going to stop stryker.

42:28.947 --> 42:32.048
And I suppose you
have a better idea.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.483
Um...

42:33.485 --> 42:35.652
Suffocate him.
I don't know.

42:35.654 --> 42:38.721
Suck all the oxygen
out of the room or something.

42:38.723 --> 42:40.189
Would you leave
the thinking to us, please?

42:40.191 --> 42:41.224
Thank you.

42:41.792 --> 42:43.660
It's brilliant.

42:59.877 --> 43:02.378
Mark my words...

43:02.380 --> 43:05.715
I will destroy Neil stryker.

43:06.617 --> 43:09.886
I'll boil him in a
bowl of his own broth.

43:16.327 --> 43:17.860
I like it.

43:18.829 --> 43:20.163
You know what?
You're fine. Just a little dust.

43:20.165 --> 43:21.531
Yeah, well see that?

43:21.533 --> 43:22.665
Splinter.

43:35.679 --> 43:36.913
Hold it.

43:44.655 --> 43:46.155
Force field.

43:46.157 --> 43:47.624
Not quite.

43:47.626 --> 43:50.493
Sir, I'm getting
strange reading.

43:50.495 --> 43:52.462
Let me guess, tachyon?

43:52.464 --> 43:55.231
Yes, sir. Off the charts.

43:55.233 --> 43:56.799
So's my shirt.

43:56.801 --> 43:58.234
No way!

43:58.236 --> 43:59.702
Yeah. Shh!

44:00.638 --> 44:02.205
We're going to have
to try and go through.

44:02.207 --> 44:04.173
Fuckin' kidding me?

44:04.175 --> 44:07.076
We'll get vaporized if
we step through that thing!

44:07.078 --> 44:09.712
Vaporized?
That would be a blessing.

44:09.714 --> 44:12.448
There's no telling what
goes on beyond the barrier.

44:12.450 --> 44:16.285
Our skin turns inside out.
Our organs fall to the
ground into a slime-pool.

44:16.287 --> 44:18.488
It's a paradox. The unknown.

44:18.490 --> 44:20.757
Forget that!
I don't want to
be no frickin' slime-pool.

44:20.759 --> 44:22.492
I'm not saying we're
going to be a slime-pool.

44:22.494 --> 44:24.127
I'm not saying we're
going to be anything.

44:24.129 --> 44:25.595
It's the unknown. It...

44:26.163 --> 44:28.331
Fine. I'll go myself.

44:28.333 --> 44:29.666
Captain.

44:30.634 --> 44:32.301
Permission to go
ahead of you, sir.

44:33.470 --> 44:35.071
Permission granted.

44:40.010 --> 44:41.577
Bravery.

44:44.114 --> 44:45.648
Show it to us.

44:46.717 --> 44:47.950
I will.

44:55.993 --> 44:57.326
Clark!

45:02.299 --> 45:03.433
Captain!

45:04.868 --> 45:06.335
Is it always
gonna be this way?

45:06.337 --> 45:08.771
I'm fine. I can live this way.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.107
But those jowls.

45:16.613 --> 45:17.780
I have a theory.

45:17.782 --> 45:20.583
This effect is only temporary.

45:20.585 --> 45:22.819
When we come out the other end,
we'll be back to normal.

45:22.821 --> 45:24.454
I really don't think
there's anything to worry about.

45:24.456 --> 45:28.157
Why don't you stroll on back,
find out for sure?

45:37.101 --> 45:40.103
So it's not just aging us.
It's more than that.

45:40.105 --> 45:41.471
That's right, Kevin.

45:41.473 --> 45:43.906
An authentic look
into your own future.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.441
Interested?

45:47.211 --> 45:49.212
With this youth comes strength.

45:50.714 --> 45:52.548
But with age comes wisdom.

45:54.184 --> 45:56.185
And with my bloodline
comes both.

45:58.255 --> 45:59.555
Step aside.

46:12.703 --> 46:14.504
The future sucks
for that mother fucker.

46:14.506 --> 46:15.471
Oh! Ho! Goddamn.

46:16.473 --> 46:20.643
Look. It's like he's been
dead for twenty years.

46:20.645 --> 46:21.978
I say we leave him.

46:21.980 --> 46:24.113
No.
Stand back, longbow.

46:24.782 --> 46:26.215
Let me try something.

46:33.690 --> 46:35.158
What the fuck!

46:35.793 --> 46:37.894
I feel... weird.

46:39.129 --> 46:41.998
I'm suppose to be over there.
And that's where I'm going.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.766
No! No! No! No!

46:43.768 --> 46:45.468
Now, Kevin,
we've seen what happens.

46:45.470 --> 46:47.069
You can't come with us.

46:48.338 --> 46:49.872
Why not?

46:53.811 --> 46:55.912
<i> The future sucks</i>
<i> for that mother--</i>

46:55.914 --> 46:57.647
so, what now, stryker?
I'm stuck?

46:59.116 --> 47:04.754
Sir, I may be able
to create mobile ray shield
that will protecting him.

47:04.756 --> 47:06.589
Alright, fine.
Just make it quick,

47:06.591 --> 47:09.192
tell you what.
I'll give him five minutes.

47:09.194 --> 47:12.128
Otherwise I'm walking
out the way I came in.

47:12.130 --> 47:13.462
Captain.

47:14.431 --> 47:16.732
So, with this thing
i can go through?

47:18.368 --> 47:20.736
Theoretically, yes.

47:20.738 --> 47:22.405
Are you sure?

47:22.407 --> 47:24.140
Maybe.

47:24.142 --> 47:25.875
Do you believe in god?

47:27.544 --> 47:28.878
No.

47:33.851 --> 47:35.251
All right.

47:38.755 --> 47:40.423
In the back.

47:45.162 --> 47:46.963
Kevin, he lives.

47:46.965 --> 47:48.397
Whatever.

47:48.799 --> 47:51.367
Whoa! Wolfman.

47:51.369 --> 47:53.336
Is that mustache regulation?

47:53.338 --> 47:54.937
Clark.

47:54.939 --> 47:58.207
In the land of the blind,
the one-eyed man is king.

47:58.209 --> 48:00.610
And nabroski...

48:00.612 --> 48:01.377
Whoa.

48:02.646 --> 48:06.616
Wow! Clearly the barrier
effect everyone the same way.

48:06.618 --> 48:09.285
Look at nabroski!
He's like a little old man.

48:09.287 --> 48:11.954
What are you, like, a hundred?
Oh, my god!

48:11.956 --> 48:13.289
Okay, here we go.

48:13.291 --> 48:14.824
I don't think that's nabroski.

48:14.826 --> 48:16.859
What are you talking about?
Of course it's him.

48:16.861 --> 48:19.295
Look same eyes. Same teeth.
Same growl.

48:19.297 --> 48:22.331
Sorry, comrades.
On my way.

48:28.405 --> 48:29.772
What?

48:29.774 --> 48:33.676
When you got to go.
You got to go.

48:36.213 --> 48:38.781
Holy shit, nabroski.
You look...

48:38.783 --> 48:40.783
Amazing.

48:41.852 --> 48:45.288
What is this little monster
cradling in your arms?

48:50.961 --> 48:53.696
What is this thing?!

48:54.231 --> 48:56.565
Whoa!

48:59.770 --> 49:02.004
Get it off me!
Get it off me! Get it off me!

49:07.644 --> 49:09.011
What goes on here?

49:09.013 --> 49:10.513
Oh! Man folk!

49:10.515 --> 49:11.314
Oh!

49:12.182 --> 49:15.785
You humans are
forbidden in these lands.

49:15.787 --> 49:18.321
This will never do.

49:18.323 --> 49:19.622
Hershel! Come here!

49:19.624 --> 49:22.158
Right away, sir.
Okay, um, stryker is over there.

49:22.160 --> 49:23.926
Stryker you say?

49:23.928 --> 49:25.928
Oh, the white wizard
is not going to like that!

49:25.930 --> 49:28.798
No! No! No!
No!

49:28.800 --> 49:30.132
Call the horde to arms.

49:30.134 --> 49:32.001
Prepare to make them suffer.

49:32.003 --> 49:33.469
Make them pay.

49:33.471 --> 49:34.770
Do as your told, hershel!

49:34.772 --> 49:36.205
As you say. Very good.

49:36.207 --> 49:38.808
Could they be, wampires?

49:38.810 --> 49:40.810
There not fucking vampires.

49:42.112 --> 49:43.679
Goblins.

49:45.282 --> 49:47.249
Hope to it, lads!

49:54.391 --> 49:58.527
One, two, three, four.
What are we fighting for?

49:58.529 --> 50:01.831
Dinner, and supper, and lunch!

50:17.315 --> 50:19.915
They're gonna
regret coming in here!

50:21.985 --> 50:23.786
Just look at them!

50:23.788 --> 50:25.321
The muppets.

50:44.474 --> 50:48.811
We goblins do not
tolerate trespasses against us.

50:48.813 --> 50:50.246
Do we, boys?

50:51.816 --> 50:56.152
You've committed
a grave treason, I'm afraid,

50:56.154 --> 51:00.256
a violation of our lands, and
offended the great sovereignty

51:00.258 --> 51:02.091
of our people.

51:02.093 --> 51:03.559
For that...

51:04.895 --> 51:07.063
...you will die.

51:08.465 --> 51:12.635
You may kill them now,
my darlings.

51:23.046 --> 51:24.713
My gun won't cock.

51:24.715 --> 51:28.984
Your weapons have
aged to no effect.

51:28.986 --> 51:31.687
You'll have to fight honorably.

51:32.923 --> 51:34.156
Damn.

51:38.628 --> 51:41.163
It's finally happening!

51:46.403 --> 51:48.037
You!

51:48.039 --> 51:49.905
Why? Why? Why?

52:01.251 --> 52:03.018
Ah, no!

52:03.020 --> 52:04.353
Whoa!

52:11.228 --> 52:12.728
Wha!

52:17.367 --> 52:18.601
Aah!

52:22.239 --> 52:25.741
Ah! Holy shit!
Fucking goblins!

52:25.743 --> 52:26.976
Right on top of ya!

52:27.945 --> 52:28.911
Goblins!

52:28.913 --> 52:31.413
Hold him down, boys!

52:31.415 --> 52:33.115
It's lunchtime.

52:34.285 --> 52:37.453
Plug him up!
Mushroom nap. Forever.

52:40.223 --> 52:42.558
It's time to sleep,

52:42.560 --> 52:44.760
my dear boy.

52:44.762 --> 52:45.928
Let's blow.

52:51.935 --> 52:54.570
Brenner!

53:00.911 --> 53:04.013
Alarm! Alarm!

53:04.015 --> 53:05.614
Do I have to take
care of everything?

53:05.616 --> 53:08.184
Alarm! Alarm!

53:11.721 --> 53:13.289
Move out!

53:13.291 --> 53:14.290
Harold!

53:14.292 --> 53:17.259
- Huh?!
- Yoo hoo!

53:17.261 --> 53:18.894
What are you doin' here?

53:18.896 --> 53:21.130
Well, I didn't want
to miss all the fun.

53:21.132 --> 53:24.033
Margaret, we're in
the middle of a war!

53:24.035 --> 53:26.001
And you bring the baby.

53:26.003 --> 53:27.937
You two have a headache?

53:30.073 --> 53:32.308
Believe me, the pain
is only in your head.

53:34.478 --> 53:37.713
That there
baby's done us no good.

53:37.715 --> 53:41.183
Except get fat off our slop
and your drink!

53:46.923 --> 53:49.358
Hey, let me
get out of here! Whoa!

53:49.360 --> 53:51.126
Like the wind!

53:52.530 --> 53:54.129
I'm pregnant again.

53:54.131 --> 53:55.931
I'm having twins this time.

53:57.467 --> 53:58.534
Twins.

53:58.536 --> 54:00.869
Oh!

54:16.219 --> 54:17.920
Hey!

54:17.922 --> 54:20.689
This suit, it's like
a fucking bug zapper!

54:20.691 --> 54:22.024
Toss 'em my way, idiots!

54:22.892 --> 54:25.394
I've got these two
who's got that one?

54:25.396 --> 54:26.962
Kevin humphries.

54:26.964 --> 54:28.697
With the candlestick.

54:28.699 --> 54:30.266
In the ballroom.

54:40.644 --> 54:41.944
Make it rain.

54:42.746 --> 54:43.912
Whoa!

54:43.914 --> 54:45.214
Whaa!

54:45.216 --> 54:46.415
Whoa!

54:46.417 --> 54:47.850
Oh!

54:48.985 --> 54:50.452
I'm invincible.

54:51.421 --> 54:54.423
No! Not my babies! No!

54:54.425 --> 54:56.125
My darlings!

54:56.127 --> 54:58.160
Too the hills!

55:01.097 --> 55:02.865
Inconceivable!

55:03.967 --> 55:05.534
Carlton!

55:07.003 --> 55:10.172
- I got just the thing.
- He was my favorite child.

55:11.274 --> 55:12.675
Right.

55:12.677 --> 55:15.411
Just going to go...
Check on the roast.

55:17.447 --> 55:18.647
Ya!

55:24.654 --> 55:26.522
Don't worry!
They'll take me
back to the nest!

55:26.524 --> 55:27.956
I'll find the hive
and then I'll...

55:27.958 --> 55:29.692
Whoa!

55:31.495 --> 55:33.195
Yeah!

55:40.603 --> 55:41.837
A hatch!

55:43.708 --> 55:46.675
I'm going to send you
back to your momma's wagina!

55:50.547 --> 55:51.980
Nabroski, I found a way out.
It's a hatch.

55:51.982 --> 55:53.015
We gotta get
the hell out of here.

55:53.017 --> 55:55.217
Stryker, I will not go with you.

55:55.219 --> 55:56.685
Hand me that wodka.

55:56.687 --> 55:58.220
I had vodka?

55:59.823 --> 56:05.127
What kind of madness
would create such monsters?

56:05.129 --> 56:09.465
Stryker, I want you to climb
that tree and save that female.

56:09.467 --> 56:10.766
Right.

56:11.301 --> 56:12.801
Forget about me.

56:12.803 --> 56:14.570
- Yeah.
- I may not make it.

56:15.305 --> 56:16.338
But...

56:17.073 --> 56:20.142
I'm going to take
some of these...

56:20.144 --> 56:21.977
...monsters...

56:21.979 --> 56:23.812
...with me!

56:23.814 --> 56:25.080
Ah!

56:57.947 --> 56:59.548
Ah ha! Stryker!

56:59.550 --> 57:01.583
You're precisely
where I want you.

57:05.955 --> 57:07.356
What gives?

57:07.358 --> 57:09.124
Where's the penguin?

57:09.126 --> 57:12.060
There's suppose to be
a ten-foot, killer penguin
in there.

57:12.062 --> 57:14.897
Darrell's been
moving stuff around again.

57:14.899 --> 57:17.866
No matter.
I still have the prisoner woman.

57:17.868 --> 57:20.936
Or should I say...
Prisoner women?

57:20.938 --> 57:22.704
Stryker, I don't have all day.

57:22.706 --> 57:23.972
I'm wasting away in here!

57:25.308 --> 57:27.943
Stryker, those women are
scheduled for termination...

57:27.945 --> 57:28.977
Within the hour.

57:28.979 --> 57:30.212
This is a big place.

57:30.214 --> 57:32.080
You've got two choices.

57:32.082 --> 57:35.117
You could capture me
or you could save the women.

57:35.119 --> 57:37.553
Don't have time to do both.

57:37.555 --> 57:39.988
You know where
neither of us are...

57:41.257 --> 57:42.491
Go.

57:43.126 --> 57:44.626
Uh, taxi!

59:28.731 --> 59:30.065
Stryker!

59:31.200 --> 59:34.570
Are you having fun
in my funhouse?

59:36.439 --> 59:40.075
Honestly, stryker,
putting the door
on the floor like that?

59:40.077 --> 59:41.243
Brilliant.

59:41.245 --> 59:43.045
It took Darrell weeks...

59:43.047 --> 59:45.147
Of starvation
to figure that one out.

59:46.549 --> 59:48.250
Alright, asshole.

59:48.751 --> 59:50.252
Where are the girls?

59:51.387 --> 59:54.523
You could kill me
right now, Neil.

59:54.525 --> 59:56.191
You could shoot
me in the face.

59:56.193 --> 59:58.093
But then,

59:58.095 --> 01:00:00.495
you would never
find the women.

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:06.034
At this present moment,
you have no have no idea

01:00:06.036 --> 01:00:07.869
where the devil they are.

01:00:07.871 --> 01:00:10.739
Or when they are?

01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:13.475
Or when they are.
What a mystery.

01:00:13.477 --> 01:00:16.211
For all you know
i took my time machine,

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:18.447
strapped them in...

01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:23.919
And blasted them
back to dinosaur times!

01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:25.754
They're here somewhere.

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:27.155
And in this time.

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.124
And I'm going to find them.

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:32.260
Business, business, business!

01:00:32.262 --> 01:00:34.763
Stryker, you're so wound up.
Relax!

01:00:34.765 --> 01:00:37.399
Here, let me draw
you a bubble bath.

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:41.803
Come on.
Take a dip with me, Neil!

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:44.272
Take a dip with ol' poppa bear.

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:46.074
It'll be like old times.

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:56.785
The old
acid in the bathtub routine.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.923
You're too good, Neil.

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:05.260
A little too good
for your own good, perhaps.

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:08.997
Oh, hey, stryker you know what?
You have got to try these.

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:11.500
It's a cosmo.
My brother swears by 'em.

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:12.834
Here.

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:16.938
Go ahead!
Take it!

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.107
They're delicious.
They're scrumptious.

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:21.810
What?!
Are you kidding me?!

01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:24.546
Poison a perfectly good cosmo?

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:27.382
Not in my lifetime.

01:01:27.384 --> 01:01:30.986
Give me this. I want to at once.
Mmh. Mmh..

01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:33.889
So good, Neil.
So good.

01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:36.291
Mmh. Yours is better than mine!

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:38.894
I've let this drag on
far too long.

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:40.796
Just tell me
where the fuck they are.

01:01:40.798 --> 01:01:42.831
Alright, stryker.

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:44.332
Alright.

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:46.968
I'm tired and I'm old.

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:49.004
If you want the women...

01:01:49.006 --> 01:01:51.173
Simply turn around

01:01:51.175 --> 01:01:52.808
and you shall find them.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.046
Deactivate.

01:03:39.415 --> 01:03:40.682
Halt.

01:03:44.287 --> 01:03:45.587
Stop.

01:04:24.493 --> 01:04:27.195
Is this all they do, Darrell?

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:30.165
Yes, but...

01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:31.867
They do work.

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:46.147
Well, I'm embarrassed.

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:48.884
Is anyone else embarrassed?

01:04:49.919 --> 01:04:54.322
Anyone else embarrassed
about the bumping robits?

01:04:54.324 --> 01:04:55.657
Darrell!

01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:57.659
How are you feeling?

01:04:57.661 --> 01:04:59.394
You ask the impossible.

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:01.196
I need real men!

01:05:01.198 --> 01:05:02.764
Men?!

01:05:03.332 --> 01:05:05.500
Yes, an army, your grace.

01:05:05.502 --> 01:05:07.569
Very skilled in soldiery.

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:08.703
No, Darrell!

01:05:08.705 --> 01:05:10.505
Enough of your schemes.

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:14.075
You see, I am the one
with the smart.

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:15.377
I beseech you, your grace.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:18.013
I've created a nine year plan.
Which will enable us...

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:19.681
Nine years?!

01:05:19.683 --> 01:05:21.216
We don't have nine minutes!

01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:23.351
Yes, but if we were too...

01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:27.055
No Darrell, no more.

01:05:27.057 --> 01:05:33.261
You see, Darrell,
I've got real plans
with real results in store.

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:35.964
Do what you will, Darrell.

01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:37.699
Goodbye.

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:51.846
Meet me in the break room
in 20 minutes for donuts!

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:57.285
You underestimate me,
your grace.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.322
But you will soon
know different.

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:03.959
Oh, yes.

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.961
Oh, yes!

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:09.676
Did I catch you at a bad time?

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:10.912
Neil stryker!

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:12.580
What are you doing here?

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:14.415
Darrell freeway.

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:17.785
So, you're the
mad scientist's new stooge.

01:09:17.787 --> 01:09:20.388
And your his old flame.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:22.823
Well...

01:09:22.826 --> 01:09:27.495
You've breathed
your last breath, stryker.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:29.964
You're in trouble now...

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:32.667
Double trouble.

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:43.444
Consider yourself warned,
Mr. stryker.

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:46.214
I'm a wizard of the blade.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:52.987
It wasn't me.

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:54.689
It was the scientist.

01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:55.857
He's mad.

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:57.225
I'll take you to the girls.

01:09:57.227 --> 01:09:58.693
They're right this way.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:00.028
Come!

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:11.906
What the f--

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:14.642
blasted machine.

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:17.478
How many times have I had to--

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.082
oh, no!

01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:22.317
Not the face!

01:10:36.198 --> 01:10:38.199
Stryker! You do care about me.

01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:39.634
Get the fuck out of the way.

01:10:43.205 --> 01:10:45.106
Get back to the ship. Hurry.

01:10:59.688 --> 01:11:03.625
Now, stryker,
I've got you in a bind!

01:11:03.627 --> 01:11:08.229
I'd just like to see
you peel your way out!

01:11:08.231 --> 01:11:11.032
Your room, stryker,
is completely airtight.

01:11:11.034 --> 01:11:15.803
At this very moment all
the oxygen is being sucked out!

01:11:15.805 --> 01:11:20.041
In two minutes time, you'll be
completely without air.

01:11:20.043 --> 01:11:21.909
In three minutes...

01:11:21.911 --> 01:11:23.511
You'll be dead.

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:26.948
Aah!

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:32.287
And now, Neil stryker,
this is where I say...

01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:34.322
<i> ...au revoir.</i>

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:45.193
Thanks, boys!

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:48.296
Yeah.

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:10.818
Stryker!

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:15.857
Thank god you're alive.

01:13:15.859 --> 01:13:17.091
Go!

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:36.711
Now how are we
gonna get out of here?

01:13:36.713 --> 01:13:38.613
I've got room for two!

01:13:38.615 --> 01:13:41.883
Strykie, you're riding bitch,
baby!

01:13:41.885 --> 01:13:43.751
Good timing, Fred.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:45.253
Too good?

01:14:00.135 --> 01:14:02.170
Thanks for coming for me.

01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:04.272
No trouble.

01:14:04.274 --> 01:14:06.941
Listen, I know I should
have been more careful.

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:08.209
I was stupid.

01:14:08.211 --> 01:14:10.745
Ah, come on, kid.
You were brave.

01:14:10.747 --> 01:14:12.046
Really?

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:16.884
Uh... okay. That's it.

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:18.386
We're done.

01:14:18.388 --> 01:14:21.122
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay, okay.

01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:22.657
Let go!

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:23.691
Sorry.

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:25.493
My paperwork.

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:49.817
Did it work?
Are you staring
at a pile of goo?

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:54.355
I planted a bomb in her body
while she was sleeping.

01:14:54.357 --> 01:14:57.492
Do you want to know
where I inserted it?

01:14:57.494 --> 01:14:59.293
Not interested.

01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:00.661
I put it in her ear.

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:01.963
What do you want?

01:15:01.965 --> 01:15:04.365
I just wanted
to make your life miserable

01:15:04.367 --> 01:15:06.868
before I jumped
through time and space.

01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:11.472
I still have the woman
that you failed to rescue.

01:15:11.474 --> 01:15:16.477
I plan to breed with her
and create a race of
atomic super men and women.

01:15:16.479 --> 01:15:18.179
If she'll have me, of course.

01:15:18.181 --> 01:15:21.349
If she won't, hey, I'll adopt.

01:15:21.351 --> 01:15:23.451
I've always wanted a baby boy.

01:15:23.453 --> 01:15:25.686
Oh, wait a minute...
I've got one right here!

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:27.021
Daddy!

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:29.423
See you in hell ,asshole!

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:33.928
This damn war!

01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:37.532
It doesn't take just soldiers.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.034
It takes friends.

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:45.873
Can I have you clean this up?

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:47.842
Hey, what happened?

01:15:47.844 --> 01:15:50.011
Veronica exploded.
Listen, the mad scientist

01:15:50.013 --> 01:15:51.746
is about to jump through time.

01:15:51.748 --> 01:15:53.481
And he has my son.

01:15:53.483 --> 01:15:55.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
He'll be gone in moments.

01:15:55.752 --> 01:15:56.984
Finished!

01:15:56.986 --> 01:15:58.553
Not quite.

01:16:01.858 --> 01:16:03.424
Stryker, Neil.

01:16:03.426 --> 01:16:05.092
One, one, three, five, eight.

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:10.598
It's the time portal.

01:16:20.943 --> 01:16:22.176
Damn.

01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:23.878
Just what I need.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:25.546
Beverly!
- Yes, Neil?

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:26.781
Quit the small talk.

01:16:26.783 --> 01:16:28.683
I need you to monitor this
like your life depends on it.

01:16:29.586 --> 01:16:31.185
Because it does.

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:33.754
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!
What are you doin', strykes?

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:34.755
I need to save my kid.

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.691
We'll deal with
the mad scientist later

01:16:36.693 --> 01:16:38.159
be back in a minute.

01:16:43.765 --> 01:16:45.466
Good luck, strykes.

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:55.343
Now he's gone too far.

01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:40.354
Daddy!

01:17:44.026 --> 01:17:46.260
Come and get me, stryker!

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.241
<i> Schnell! Schnell!</i>

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:23.864
Oh! Ho! Ho!

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:47.054
<i> Du.</i>

01:18:51.994 --> 01:18:53.661
<i> - Nein?</i>
<i> - Nein!</i>

01:18:53.663 --> 01:18:55.062
<i> - Nein?!</i>
- Fuck this.

01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:08.342
You Nazi bitch.

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:19.453
Such a waste.

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:52.153
Alright kid, just follow me--

01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:53.487
oh!

01:19:54.289 --> 01:19:55.256
Stryker!

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:58.626
Whatever happened to your
little rule about not

01:19:58.628 --> 01:20:00.795
altering the entire
course of history!

01:20:00.797 --> 01:20:03.731
I mean, you must have murdered
half the third reich down there!

01:20:03.733 --> 01:20:06.967
Holocaust?
More like holo-lost in time,
thanks to you!

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:08.302
Give me back my kid!

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:10.638
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Your son?

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:13.307
Why I've got bad news for ya,
stryker.

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:14.975
The boy loves me.

01:20:14.977 --> 01:20:16.944
As if I were his own kin.

01:20:16.946 --> 01:20:21.448
He and I have formed a paternal
bond that cannot be broken.

01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:23.417
You're far too late, stryker.

01:20:23.419 --> 01:20:25.119
You see, the boy...

01:20:25.121 --> 01:20:27.822
Wishes for me to raise him...

01:20:27.824 --> 01:20:29.924
...as my very own.

01:20:29.926 --> 01:20:32.293
Save me
from the crazy man, daddy!

01:20:32.295 --> 01:20:34.128
What?! You little traitor!

01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:35.429
You said you loved me!

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:38.999
You little shit!

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:43.938
Are you okay?

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.739
Daddy, where's mommy?

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:48.642
She's still dead, kid.

01:20:48.644 --> 01:20:50.311
Come on,
let's get this crap off you.

01:20:50.313 --> 01:20:51.946
We gotta get outta here.

01:20:53.615 --> 01:20:56.150
What did I tell you, kid?
Safe and sound.

01:20:56.152 --> 01:20:57.484
Yay!

01:20:57.486 --> 01:20:59.720
Take my kid.
Keep him safe.

01:20:59.722 --> 01:21:02.990
Continue time-tracking
the mad scientist.
He could be anywhere.

01:21:02.992 --> 01:21:04.825
Sir, there's something
on the monitor.

01:21:04.827 --> 01:21:06.393
Bring it up.

01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:10.030
Yeah.
October 12th, 1999, 12:01am.

01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:11.465
Right here.

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:15.035
Ah! You got the boy back.

01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:18.372
Excellent. I gotta get rollers
on my fucking luggage.

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:21.041
This is for shit, stryker!

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:22.376
I didn't bring a passport.

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:23.744
And I know you're
going to yell at me.

01:21:23.746 --> 01:21:26.146
But who needs a passport when
the end of the world is coming?

01:21:27.183 --> 01:21:28.582
Fred, you're not coming with me.

01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:31.518
No. No.
Talk me down off this cliff.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:34.855
Talk me off it, stryker,
or I will fucking jump.

01:21:34.857 --> 01:21:37.992
Talk me off this cliff, stryker!

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:41.996
Stryker!

01:21:41.998 --> 01:21:43.931
You're on suspension.
I want this man arrested.

01:21:43.933 --> 01:21:45.599
Wait!

01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:47.868
This guy is saving
the entire world,

01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:49.370
and you want
him arrested?

01:21:49.372 --> 01:21:53.707
Let him finish.
You can have my resignation
in the morning.

01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:56.310
Fine!
But we do it my way.

01:21:57.545 --> 01:22:01.515
Stryker, you kill the scientist,
I'll save the girl.

01:22:01.517 --> 01:22:03.183
- No.
- Fine!

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:08.022
I'll kill the girl,
you save the scientist.

01:22:08.024 --> 01:22:09.590
No one is going with me.

01:22:09.592 --> 01:22:11.025
I'm going alone.

01:22:11.027 --> 01:22:12.359
Fine!

01:22:12.361 --> 01:22:14.061
But when all this is over...

01:22:14.063 --> 01:22:15.763
I'm back on suspension.

01:22:15.765 --> 01:22:17.865
You bet your ass you are.

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:27.942
You, throw me my bag.

01:22:27.944 --> 01:22:29.376
Yes, sir!

01:22:33.248 --> 01:22:35.316
Go get 'im, strykes!

01:22:35.318 --> 01:22:37.318
Oh, god.
Where are we now

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.819
we don't have time
for you foolish questions.

01:22:38.821 --> 01:22:40.287
We gotta haul ass out of here.

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:41.288
Now get the fuck in the truck.

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:42.723
Jesus.

01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:44.625
Alright, Darrell.

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:47.227
Your plan better work.

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:54.234
Alright, the keys
are suppose to be...

01:22:54.236 --> 01:22:55.970
Hm.

01:22:55.972 --> 01:22:57.705
Wait a minute.

01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.673
The hell?

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:02.876
Looking for these?

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:07.147
Your grace...

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:10.351
I am honored

01:23:10.353 --> 01:23:14.421
that you would finally
warm to my little plan.

01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:17.524
There's one thing
i forgot to mention.

01:23:17.526 --> 01:23:21.161
There's just no place in it...
For you.

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:25.232
I've had nine years
to plan my escape...

01:23:26.368 --> 01:23:30.337
You have exactly
nine seconds for yours.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.643
Perhaps now your grace
will agree...

01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:38.312
...that in fact...

01:23:38.314 --> 01:23:42.616
...i am the one with the smart.

01:23:42.618 --> 01:23:44.318
I'm afraid...

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.021
...you're going to die...

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:53.527
Impossible!

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:55.863
You're fucked.

01:23:55.865 --> 01:23:59.299
Get out of the truck!
I've got a few more tricks
up my rabbit hole.

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:06.073
Shut your fat, overweight shit.

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:08.308
Let her go.

01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:10.144
Not this time, stryker.

01:24:10.146 --> 01:24:11.512
You're too late.

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:18.218
You see, I set my time-portal
to send us so far into time...

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:20.421
...that you'll never find us.

01:24:23.324 --> 01:24:29.163
And now, stryker, a game of
chess that will span the ages.

01:24:29.165 --> 01:24:31.065
I'll make the first move.

01:24:33.602 --> 01:24:37.738
I'll see you in hell,
Neil stryker!

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.406
Ha! Ha!

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:43.744
Ha!

01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:22.449
Ah!

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:25.219
What the bloody devil
do you suppose that was?

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:28.021
It's a clue!

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:31.258
Come, Watson.
To the lighthouse!

01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:33.460
Move! Move, you fool!

01:26:07.128 --> 01:26:08.729
Ah!

01:26:11.933 --> 01:26:16.170
Whoa.

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:19.740
Bravo, stryker.

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:22.543
You win.

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:26.613
But you are
forgetting one thing...

01:26:28.216 --> 01:26:32.853
My ghost is gonna
haunt the shit out of you.

01:26:41.563 --> 01:26:46.300
I'm not kidding, stryker.
Seriously, it's gonna be weird.

01:26:46.302 --> 01:26:48.735
For no reason at all,
just a beak...

01:26:48.737 --> 01:26:50.537
Will grow from my face.

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:52.039
And I'll huff...

01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:53.807
And I'll puff...

01:26:53.809 --> 01:26:55.876
And I'll blow...

01:27:16.698 --> 01:27:19.499
Damn, that was disturbing.

01:27:19.501 --> 01:27:21.168
Yeah, no shit.

01:27:21.170 --> 01:27:22.936
What ever happened
with dying with dignity?

01:27:22.938 --> 01:27:24.171
Yeah.

01:27:24.173 --> 01:27:26.273
He was plum fuck crazy,
wasn't he?

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:28.842
Well, least it's over.

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:31.578
Right.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.747
Now, wait a second.

01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:38.418
Isn't this the part
where the hero kisses the girl?

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:41.355
This ain't lover's Lane,
sweetheart.

01:27:41.357 --> 01:27:43.590
We're up to our eyeballs
in dead guy.

01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:45.259
You're a nurse,
you've wiped asses.

01:27:45.261 --> 01:27:48.395
Clean this shit up
before some kid
comes around and plays in it.

01:27:54.869 --> 01:27:56.303
You ready?

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:21.895
Warning. Rift anomaly.

01:28:21.897 --> 01:28:24.631
Warning. Unknown origin.

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:27.234
That's just a mile up the road.

01:28:27.236 --> 01:28:28.635
Strange.

01:28:32.674 --> 01:28:33.840
Ah!

01:28:33.842 --> 01:28:35.642
Oh! Oh!

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:37.411
Oh, my god!

01:28:37.413 --> 01:28:38.912
My hero!

01:28:40.015 --> 01:28:41.415
Oh! Oh!

01:28:41.417 --> 01:28:43.417
Oh, this is disgusting.
- Oh, thank you!

01:28:43.419 --> 01:28:46.353
What in god's name
happened to you?
Peel this woman off me!

01:28:46.355 --> 01:28:47.788
Yes, sir.

01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:48.822
Eh!

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:51.158
Where's stryker?!
Throw her back.

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.759
No! No! No! No!
He's coming.

01:28:52.761 --> 01:28:54.227
He's right behind me.

01:28:57.865 --> 01:28:59.199
It worked.

01:28:59.201 --> 01:29:00.634
He's all yours.

01:29:00.636 --> 01:29:02.502
<i> Well done.</i>

01:29:03.204 --> 01:29:04.371
I love you!

01:29:04.373 --> 01:29:06.006
<i> Yes.</i>

01:29:06.008 --> 01:29:07.274
<i> You do.</i>

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:09.910
You son of a bitch.

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:13.480
<i> Through your wildest dreams...</i>

01:29:13.482 --> 01:29:16.216
<i> ...you could never imagine...</i>

01:29:16.218 --> 01:29:18.852
<i> ...what lies in wait for you.</i>

01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:24.391
<i> Did you really think you'd be</i>
<i>able to could keep it a secret?</i>

01:29:24.393 --> 01:29:26.960
<i> While you were tracking him,</i>

01:29:26.962 --> 01:29:28.328
<i> I was tracking you.</i>

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:33.066
<i> Chasing that buffoon, you</i>
<i> left more ripples through time</i>

01:29:33.068 --> 01:29:36.236
<i> than a stone in a pond.</i>

01:29:36.238 --> 01:29:38.839
<i> So, you can track</i>
<i> a time-portal, can you?</i>

01:29:38.841 --> 01:29:41.408
<i> Then perhaps you'll follow</i>
<i>this through the looking glass,</i>

01:29:41.410 --> 01:29:43.243
<i> little Alice.</i>

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:03.997
Well, pops,

01:30:03.999 --> 01:30:06.233
you always said
you'd see you me hell.

01:30:09.103 --> 01:30:10.837
I'm looking forward to it.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.213
<i> Come, stryker.</i>

01:30:21.449 --> 01:30:25.552
<i> Take a bite of the cheese</i>
<i> in a mousetrap more elaborate,</i>

01:30:25.554 --> 01:30:28.054
<i> than the world has ever known.</i>

01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:57.844
Smells like...

01:31:58.312 --> 01:32:00.180
...liverwurst.

01:32:00.848 --> 01:32:02.349
Hey, nabroski!

01:32:02.351 --> 01:32:04.851
Toss me a bite, man, seriously,
I'm starving over here.

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:14.194
That's funny.

01:32:14.196 --> 01:32:16.396
You're quite the comedian.

01:32:16.398 --> 01:32:19.566
We gotta comedian over here!
You dick!

01:32:19.568 --> 01:32:22.736
Thanks for tossing my
bones on the other side, idiot!

01:32:22.738 --> 01:32:24.037
Least I can leave,

01:32:24.039 --> 01:32:25.572
you're weird for stayin'.

01:32:25.574 --> 01:32:27.240
You got no hope!

01:32:27.242 --> 01:32:29.142
You got no water!

01:32:29.144 --> 01:32:30.143
You got no light!

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:34.681
Except for this little ray
of sunshine right here!

01:32:45.159 --> 01:32:47.160
When you've got to go...

01:32:47.762 --> 01:32:49.963
...you've got to go.
