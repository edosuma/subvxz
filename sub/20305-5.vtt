NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:04.295 --> 00:06.089
-Oh!
-DOCTOR: Oh, yeah!

00:06.172 --> 00:09.843
Mayoral candidate Fisk's resolve
to move into the Downey projects

00:09.926 --> 00:11.219
appears unshakable.

00:11.594 --> 00:13.972
It's the living conditions
of these people in the projects

00:14.055 --> 00:15.223
that I'm concerned with.

00:15.306 --> 00:17.767
Deputy Chief Mahoney
is a fact of your life.

00:17.851 --> 00:18.810
He's your superior.

00:18.893 --> 00:21.563
Until this election,
every day if I've got to,

00:21.646 --> 00:24.190
I'm gonna come up here
and change your diapers.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.985
How would you feel if you found out
that the grillwork on these windows

00:27.068 --> 00:28.194
hasn't been inspected in over--

00:28.278 --> 00:29.946
(screams)

00:33.116 --> 00:35.660
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:35.744 --> 00:37.662
<i>...crime-infested areas like the Red Zone,</i>

00:37.746 --> 00:40.373
<i>that we've now given over to the criminals</i>
<i>and smut peddlers.</i>

00:40.457 --> 00:42.083
Ozzie Cleveland's a real nice guy.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.335
I just don't see him
as the mayor of a city.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.504
DORIS:
They can do anything they want to me

00:46.588 --> 00:48.048
if it brings my baby back!

00:48.506 --> 00:49.841
I killed him!

00:49.924 --> 00:52.719
The arraignment's this afternoon.
She's in custody until then.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.513
You'll have time to shave her head
and tattoo a number on her arm.

00:55.597 --> 00:59.225
I want some of your people, Frank,
undercover in one of those sex palaces.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.603
-I'm gonna hire cops?
-Four of us.

01:01.686 --> 01:03.772
So, uh, Ed,

01:04.481 --> 01:06.274
anything you want to talk to me about?

01:06.357 --> 01:08.109
Do you want to talk to me
about your problem?

01:08.193 --> 01:10.904
You raided a porno supermarket
in Midtown this morning.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.447
It's a cheap, shoddy attempt

01:12.530 --> 01:15.200
to put a feather in candidate
Daniels' cap on election day.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.410
(screaming)

01:17.494 --> 01:18.703
Ah!

01:18.787 --> 01:19.829
Take it easy.

01:19.913 --> 01:20.914
Would you like a Popsicle?

01:20.997 --> 01:22.707
-What would you like?
-(sighs)

01:23.833 --> 01:24.834
Banana.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.464
Police. Who's there?

01:32.550 --> 01:33.760
PHIL: Item nine.

01:34.344 --> 01:38.264
Father Time, ladies and gentlemen,
is a fickle comrade.

01:39.390 --> 01:42.936
He seduces us
with his apparent steadfastness,

01:43.186 --> 01:45.563
yet gives his allegiance to no one.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.691
Councilman Benjamin Fisk

01:48.775 --> 01:51.069
campaigned on an agenda for the future.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.113
Now Mr. Fisk is dead.

01:53.363 --> 01:58.201
And time, as is its want,
moves relentlessly onward,

01:59.077 --> 02:03.581
as does the Progressive Coalition Party,
whose emergency meeting last night

02:03.665 --> 02:06.417
produced a new mayoral candidate,
Ozzie Cleveland.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.211
-Whoa!
-All right.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.129
(crowd murmurs)

02:09.212 --> 02:12.715
Ozzie needs no introduction
as a distinguished commander from Midtown,

02:12.799 --> 02:14.759
winner of three medals of valor,

02:14.843 --> 02:18.429
and former president
of the Black Officers' Coalition.

02:18.513 --> 02:19.806
Yeah.

02:20.056 --> 02:22.225
Now, the nomination of one of our own

02:22.308 --> 02:25.019
makes two of our own
with their crafts in the mayoral waters.

02:25.103 --> 02:28.356
It's a safe bet the political currents
will be swift.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.567
Let's all navigate with caution.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.694
(chattering)

02:33.278 --> 02:36.573
Item ten. This week's Dysfunction Seminar

02:36.865 --> 02:38.867
will commence at 9:00 a.m. Saturday

02:38.950 --> 02:42.328
at Brighton State College
entitled "Why Me?"

02:42.412 --> 02:44.247
(laughter)

02:44.330 --> 02:48.543
"Impotence and frigidity
in the aftermath of armed encounter."

02:48.877 --> 02:52.130
Locally renowned sexologist
Harriet Potate will preside.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.882
Wine and cheese served afterward.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.091
Item 11.

02:55.175 --> 02:58.136
As a final note as regards the weather

02:58.219 --> 03:01.806
and other planetary conditions
this blustery autumnal day,

03:02.098 --> 03:05.894
high winds, people,
that blow and crack your cheeks.

03:06.978 --> 03:10.940
On the previous tour, Officer Lipsky,
while gazing at the full moon,

03:11.024 --> 03:14.944
was struck by an airborne sign
torn from the edifice

03:15.028 --> 03:17.822
of Ace Kadinsky's Boiler Service.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.574
(laughter)

03:19.657 --> 03:24.329
Well, the impact of said advertisement
upon Officer Lipsky's unsuspecting dome,

03:24.621 --> 03:27.582
requiring 17 stitches.

03:27.665 --> 03:29.459
Our condolences to Officer Lipsky,

03:29.542 --> 03:32.420
and let us remind ourselves
that though crime,

03:32.503 --> 03:36.299
beleagued by the unexpected
wind-chill factor, is down,

03:36.507 --> 03:39.719
it is<i> up </i>because of the full moon,

03:39.969 --> 03:42.222
which means it will remain the same.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.183
And that is sufficient for our purposes.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.852
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.231
And hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:51.606 --> 03:53.608
Let's be careful out there, huh?

03:57.528 --> 04:00.073
I'll tell you, Neal,
Ozzie Cleveland's a real nice guy.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.450
I just don't see him
as the mayor of a city.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.452
-White man's job, right J.D.?
-Hey, did I say that?

04:04.535 --> 04:05.703
You didn't have to, babe.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.539
Come on, man.
Give me a little credit, all right?

04:08.623 --> 04:11.292
I got serious reservations about the man
in the leadership department.

04:11.376 --> 04:14.504
-That does not make me a Klansman.
-That don't make you right, either.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.839
Man, you haven't even been
following the campaign.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.051
Hey, I've been watching it on the tube,
not wearing it on my sleeve.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.887
I'm gonna tell you something, wise guy.
You're looking at a man who's gonna vote.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.722
Goody. We'll pin a rose on you.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.391
Hey, believe it, Dad.

04:26.891 --> 04:29.227
I mean, what do you need?
A driver's license, right?

04:29.560 --> 04:32.522
Hey, Bobby, look at this.
The house is out of foreclosure.

04:32.605 --> 04:33.815
All right, Mike!

04:33.898 --> 04:36.359
You saved the whole situation for me, man.
My wife was all--

04:36.442 --> 04:39.237
Hey, look, I'm just happy
that, uh, you're looking tall.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.238
Thanks.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.407
(paper rustles)

04:43.408 --> 04:48.079
HOWARD: I must confess, Ramundo,
the current fad of electing mayors

04:48.162 --> 04:51.499
with the last names
of former generals and presidents

04:51.582 --> 04:55.503
in your major urban areas
is one that causes me some distress.

04:55.586 --> 04:56.629
How's that, Howard?

04:56.713 --> 05:01.217
Well, you got Washington in Chicago,
you got Bradley out in the West,

05:01.301 --> 05:04.429
and now you got Cleveland
right here in our environment.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.431
I mean, they're usurpers.

05:06.514 --> 05:10.935
They're trading on the names
of our great dead heroes.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.063
They didn't exactly usurp
their names, Howard.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.691
They had their real names
stolen from them.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.943
(scoffs) Yes.

05:19.694 --> 05:20.862
I saw that program.

05:20.945 --> 05:24.282
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:24.365 --> 05:25.450
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:25.533 --> 05:29.579
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:29.662 --> 05:31.122
(sirens wailing)

05:36.586 --> 05:40.506
(theme music playing)

07:03.423 --> 07:04.257
Chief...

07:04.841 --> 07:05.675
Uh, Ray?

07:05.758 --> 07:08.678
I have spent long nights
thinking about your promise.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.013
Refresh my recollection here, Raymond.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.140
Of a captaincy.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.100
Ah, rest easy.

07:14.183 --> 07:16.394
First vacancy goes to Calletano.

07:16.477 --> 07:17.645
It's not enough.

07:18.396 --> 07:19.480
Beg pardon?

07:19.564 --> 07:21.023
You must promise more.

07:22.191 --> 07:23.609
You want to be governor, Ray?

07:23.693 --> 07:25.945
I want a jobs program for minority youth.

07:26.237 --> 07:29.198
I want Boliver Park reopened.

07:30.199 --> 07:31.325
I want bilingual education.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.452
I am not in a position

07:32.535 --> 07:35.079
to give chapter-and-verse commitments
right now, Ray.

07:35.496 --> 07:39.041
-What I can assure is my good--
-That's not enough!

07:39.292 --> 07:41.377
I want chapter and verse!

07:41.461 --> 07:43.171
What the hell's Cleveland offering Latins?

07:43.254 --> 07:45.756
I've yet to see the man
be specific about anything!

07:45.840 --> 07:47.925
Do you want me to find out
what Cleveland is offering?

07:50.344 --> 07:52.138
That sounds like a threat, Ray.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.557
I don't respond well to threats.

07:54.640 --> 07:58.060
I am trying to tell you
that promising<i> me </i>career advancement--

07:58.144 --> 08:00.563
You got everything on the table
I intend to offer.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.732
If I were you, I'd make do.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.568
-Excuse me.
-Ray.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.153
-Good morning, Frank.
-Chief.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.369
Just caught my worthy opponent
on one of those morning wake-up shows.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.496
So did I.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.748
-(door closes)
-Is that so? Hmm.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.249
We'll have to give you more to do up here.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.002
Dropped by the hospital to visit Fay,
she had it on.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.212
How is she? How's her little one?

08:24.295 --> 08:25.880
Both fine. Coming home soon.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.173
What did you think of Ozzie?

08:27.256 --> 08:30.593
Ah! A bunch of stumbling generalities.
It's almost embarrassing.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.971
But now, he did dredge up
the Red Zone, Frank.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.515
And my opinion guy says

08:35.598 --> 08:37.725
that I might have a little vulnerability
on the smut issue.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.769
The Red Zone is in Midtown, Chief.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.437
We're all one city, Frank.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.689
Let's not invoke
petty parochial distinctions.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.276
I don't want Midtown cops.
That's Ozzie's precinct.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.569
No.

08:48.653 --> 08:52.281
I want some of your people, Frank,
undercover in one of those sex palaces.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.158
My people have been
double-shifting for two months

08:54.242 --> 08:56.118
trying to keep the lid on a gang war.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.789
Frank, in addition to catering
to every warped mind in the city,

08:59.997 --> 09:03.543
these places are your basic five and dimes
for fencing drugs.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.462
Now, I want some bust down there.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.588
Monday at the latest.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.006
Monday at 4:00 p.m.?

09:09.465 --> 09:10.800
4:00 p.m. would be perfect.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.885
Evening news the night before we vote.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.597
And if I told you that this
operation commenced a week ago,

09:17.515 --> 09:21.018
I just don't want Ozzie accusing me
of reacting to his nonsense.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.687
This comes close to politicizing

09:22.770 --> 09:24.272
this department's activities,
don't you think?

09:24.647 --> 09:26.107
This ain't horseshoes, Captain.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.067
Get your people down there.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.155
I'm gonna win this election, Frank.

09:35.324 --> 09:36.325
(door closes)

09:37.076 --> 09:39.704
People, pornography is a bog,

09:39.787 --> 09:43.624
a quagmire from which law enforcement
seldom returns with its prey,

09:43.708 --> 09:47.461
and accordingly, Operation Tenderloin
will take as its objectives

09:47.545 --> 09:51.799
those bottom-dwellers
who thrive in smut's habitat,

09:51.882 --> 09:55.428
the drug dealers,
the traffickers in stolen articles.

09:55.511 --> 09:58.514
We're after pushers and fences,
right, Lieutenant?

09:59.015 --> 09:59.849
Correct.

10:00.516 --> 10:05.938
Our target is Murray's Wonderland,
a veritable supermarket of filth.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.150
Now, however unpleasant this may be,

10:09.233 --> 10:13.446
some of you are going to have to take on
the colorations of that environment.

10:13.529 --> 10:17.700
Some of you are going to have to take jobs
at Murray's.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.369
Now, obviously, our first concern

10:20.453 --> 10:22.872
is to secure the cooperation
of the proprietor.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.790
(scoffs) Murray?

10:26.083 --> 10:28.252
He'll have to hire some of you on.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.588
Now, I thought--

10:30.838 --> 10:33.507
Lieutenant, uh, lieutenant,
trust us, okay?

10:33.591 --> 10:34.842
We'll set it up with Murray.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.637
What are you, crazy? I'm gonna hire cops?

10:37.720 --> 10:38.721
J.D.: Four of us.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.806
NEAL:
We're not gonna hassle your customers.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.475
We want traffickers--

10:42.558 --> 10:44.018
MICK: Dealers, and fences.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.353
What about my employees?

10:45.436 --> 10:47.313
I got people who've been with me
two and three months.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.607
-Give them a couple days off.
-Paid vacation.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.859
Do it, Murray. It beats plan B.

10:51.942 --> 10:52.902
Which is what?

10:52.985 --> 10:55.154
-You don't wanna know.
-Oh, yeah, I do!

10:55.237 --> 10:56.072
Okay.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.911
Yeah, Pit Bull, Pit Bull, this is Top Dog.
Play him a few bars.

11:02.286 --> 11:05.206
(police sirens wail)

11:15.299 --> 11:17.134
Oh, come on!

11:20.721 --> 11:24.141
No good. This is no good.
I'm calling my mouthpiece.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.436
Okay, we'll hassle your trade.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.231
And we got a big truck
parked about a block away.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.983
Drive right up to your front door
and bust your whole inventory.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.403
You can't do this.
I got people on retainer.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.113
Threatening my inventory!

11:37.571 --> 11:38.406
Let me talk to Al.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.324
J.D.: Sure, they'll get your inventory
back for you.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.370
-Out of there. Show me some ID.
-(shouts)

11:46.539 --> 11:48.958
-(screaming continues)
-Get him down!

11:49.041 --> 11:51.335
(grunts)

11:51.419 --> 11:52.795
(screams)

11:53.254 --> 11:55.631
-(telephone receiver slams)
-Oh! My Wonderland.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.300
My Wonderland!

11:58.884 --> 12:01.303
-Oh!
-Come on, Murray.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.431
Four of us... undercover.

12:05.391 --> 12:08.018
Okay, okay,
I guess it's time to call the truck.

12:09.478 --> 12:12.148
-Yeah, yeah, Bull Moose, Bull Moose--
-All right, all right, call them off!

12:12.231 --> 12:13.190
We're hired?

12:19.655 --> 12:20.614
That's it. We're done.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.283
Is it your ribs?

12:22.366 --> 12:25.411
(groans) Like a mule.
The kid must be on dust.

12:25.953 --> 12:27.788
All right, we'll get you
to Emergency, all right?

12:27.872 --> 12:30.040
No, (groans) I'm okay.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.086
On second thought...

12:34.837 --> 12:37.131
-(murmurs)
-All right, just five minutes.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.927
Ow. Damn.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.430
I think it's awful upright
of the department

12:44.513 --> 12:46.474
to give us an hour and a half off to vote.

12:46.849 --> 12:50.144
Read your union mail, Renko.
We won that in our last negotiation.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.687
-Is that so?
-Yup.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.189
Well, the point is this--

12:53.272 --> 12:55.399
I know you're gonna vote
for Ozzie Cleveland,

12:55.858 --> 12:58.527
and I have absolutely no sensitivity
in informing you of the fact

12:58.611 --> 13:02.031
that unless I get hit by a bus,
I'm gonna vote for Chief Daniels.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.617
-So?
-So that means that we're gonna spend

13:04.700 --> 13:08.037
an hour and a half next Tuesday
just canceling each other out.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.080
I don't figure it that way.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.082
(sighs) Well, I figure there's
about a hundred more things

13:12.166 --> 13:14.168
I'd rather be doing
with my time than that.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.545
Renko, you can do whatever you want
with your hour and a half.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.798
I'm gonna spend my time voting for Ozzie.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.759
I'm gonna wake up next Wednesday
knowing I voted for him.

13:21.842 --> 13:25.221
Robert, I always knew
you were a man of strong convictions,

13:25.304 --> 13:27.014
but I never figured you for a fanatic.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.850
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Unit 2202, priority backup.</i>

13:29.934 --> 13:31.310
<i>Prowlers, second floor.</i>

13:31.393 --> 13:33.729
<i>1095 Lemoyne Avenue.</i>

13:33.813 --> 13:35.731
Unit 2202 responding.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.041
(car door squeaks)

13:55.584 --> 13:56.585
Which apartment?

13:56.919 --> 13:58.796
I don't know.
All they said was second floor.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.090
This is unit 2207 at Lemoyne.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.049
Any backups on the way?

14:02.132 --> 14:05.219
<i>Roger, 2207. Unit 2202 rolling, priority.</i>

14:05.302 --> 14:07.596
-I got the back. I'll meet you up there.
-All right.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.534
(indistinct conversation)

14:36.584 --> 14:38.794
Police. Who's there?

14:39.211 --> 14:40.296
Identify yourself.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.766
Oh, my God.

15:09.909 --> 15:10.951
Anyone else here?

15:14.914 --> 15:15.998
Okay, call it in.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.501
Mike, call it in!

15:28.177 --> 15:30.054
WOMAN (over P.A.):
<i>Doctor Malloy to the E.R.</i>

15:30.888 --> 15:32.723
So, Officer Bates...

15:33.849 --> 15:34.892
Do you come here often?

15:36.894 --> 15:38.562
-What happened?
-(sighs)

15:39.355 --> 15:41.607
I knocked this kid out with my ribs,

15:41.690 --> 15:43.943
the one getting all the medical attention.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.280
-(groans)
-It must have been quite a brawl.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.406
So, what do you think it is?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.992
Oh, smart money's on a cracked rib.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.245
-Let's get a picture.
-(shouting)

16:02.461 --> 16:04.129
COFFEY: Calm down. Take it easy.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.590
Your face is melting!

16:07.299 --> 16:09.468
-All right, kid.
-(grunting)

16:09.802 --> 16:13.889
-Get the handcuffs on him.
-(shouting continues)

16:14.974 --> 16:16.558
All right, now, it's all right. Calm down.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.477
-(screams)
-Calm down.

16:22.147 --> 16:22.982
It's all right. Calm down.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.275
MICK: Don't come in here with a $20 bill.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.319
Don't you have anything
smaller than that, Ace?

16:27.403 --> 16:30.155
-Excuse me.
-No minors!

16:30.239 --> 16:31.949
Does your mother know you're here?

16:36.537 --> 16:37.788
What are you doing here?

16:38.831 --> 16:41.166
Show me some money, hairbag, or beat it.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.837
(whispers) Armagast. Midtown.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.590
-Get that out of sight, will you?
-This is Murray's.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.217
Who said guys from the Hill
could do Murray's?

16:50.300 --> 16:52.177
Division said, so get off my foot.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.930
Show me the paperwork.
Who's in command here?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.682
If you don't walk away from me, Hairball,

16:56.765 --> 16:58.559
I'm gonna make an example
to these sick birds

16:58.642 --> 17:00.352
how I don't tolerate weirdos!

17:00.811 --> 17:02.312
I'm taking this downtown.

17:02.604 --> 17:05.733
You guys on the Hill,
you're all mental cases.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.526
(growls)

17:09.987 --> 17:12.448
We got the call, backups were on the way,

17:13.115 --> 17:14.658
Kolzicki and I separated.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.285
MAN: Where did Kolzicki go?

17:17.745 --> 17:19.955
Around back... up the fire escape.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.249
I went inside.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.377
I found a door open, and I entered.

17:25.961 --> 17:28.338
Did you signal your partner
that you were entering the apartment?

17:28.547 --> 17:30.466
No, he was still outside.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.010
Then what happened?

17:34.261 --> 17:35.179
I entered.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.475
It was dark... empty.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.644
I heard this noise somewhere and...

17:44.938 --> 17:45.773
A TV.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.274
I went into the bedroom.

17:48.275 --> 17:49.276
Describe what you saw.

17:50.986 --> 17:51.820
Not much.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.280
It was dark.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.909
Just the TV set.

18:00.704 --> 18:01.538
And I, uh...

18:03.040 --> 18:04.833
And I, uh, saw somebody...

18:05.876 --> 18:07.711
crouched on the floor behind the bed.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.090
Just behind...

18:12.007 --> 18:14.676
-(thuds)
-I thought it was a prowler!

18:16.512 --> 18:17.429
(sobs)

18:18.931 --> 18:20.099
I thought it was a prowler.

18:22.017 --> 18:23.894
-Did you identify yourself?
-Yes!

18:25.187 --> 18:28.524
He pointed a gun.
I mean, it looked so real!

18:29.525 --> 18:32.027
How much time did you have to react
before you discharged your weapon?

18:32.111 --> 18:33.737
Not much. A second.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.406
A second!
I mean, I'd give anything to take it back!

18:36.865 --> 18:39.701
I've got kids of my own! But I thought--

18:39.785 --> 18:43.038
I believed, you know,
I<i> believed </i>there was a weapon!

18:44.873 --> 18:45.916
I believed it!

18:49.294 --> 18:51.296
Officer Perez,
we're just here to get your statement.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.215
I know. I know. I know.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.636
(softly) I know. I'm... I'm upset.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.808
Is it true the police were acting
on what appears to have been a crank call?

19:02.891 --> 19:04.935
-Have you found the mother?
-I don't have all the facts yet.

19:05.018 --> 19:06.979
It appears to be a tragedy
for all concerned.

19:07.062 --> 19:09.189
-Excuse me.
-Ozzie.

19:09.273 --> 19:12.151
Excuse me. Ozzie, a moment.

19:12.234 --> 19:15.445
-What the hell happened? He shot a kid?
-All I heard was the news report.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.115
Frank, what in God's name happened?

19:18.198 --> 19:21.201
IAD's in with Perez right now.
I haven't had a chance to talk to him.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.536
But he shot a child?

19:22.619 --> 19:24.288
Whom he mistook for a prowler.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.081
That's the preliminary information.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.167
Since when is it policy
to shoot a prowler?

19:28.250 --> 19:29.501
He thought there was a gun.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.296
They're still busy
getting all the facts together.

19:32.629 --> 19:36.800
Ozzie, uh, I think this is something
we should both agree right now

19:36.884 --> 19:39.011
that we do not throw
into the political hopper.

19:39.094 --> 19:41.138
I have no intentions of doing that.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.933
-But I want to know the facts!
-And you'll know them. I promise you.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.643
You will not be on the outside.

19:46.727 --> 19:50.063
I just think this is too incendiary
and too tragic a situation--

19:50.147 --> 19:51.440
I agree. I agree.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.900
Let's not play politics.

19:54.568 --> 19:55.903
<i>I </i>won't if<i> you won't.</i>

19:58.530 --> 19:59.781
(telephones ringing)

20:00.407 --> 20:03.160
Frank. ADA Bernstein is here.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.459
Ray, is there anything
I should know about Perez?

20:11.084 --> 20:12.628
Nothing out of the ordinary.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.505
He was experiencing
some financial difficulties,

20:15.589 --> 20:18.342
-but he's got it under control now.
-Okay.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.887
Maybe I should just pitch a tent
in your squad room, Frank.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.306
Maybe you should try trusting
your chain of command.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.476
All right.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.103
We got a way to go on the kid's mother.

20:31.730 --> 20:32.648
Meaning what?

20:33.148 --> 20:36.026
Meaning I took the liberty of discussing
the situation with your superiors,

20:36.109 --> 20:38.862
and both the D.A.
and the City Corporation Council

20:38.946 --> 20:40.781
think we're dealing
with a wrong broad here.

20:40.864 --> 20:42.074
Wait a second.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.993
I'd understood we were here
to discuss charging Perez.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.996
I think this is probably a meeting
to discuss<i> all </i>the pertinent facts.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.666
One of which is we seem to be dealing
with a felony endangerment.

20:50.749 --> 20:54.378
Another of which,
as the captain has just informed me,

20:54.461 --> 20:56.755
is that I need to let
the chain of command function.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.674
Excuse me, gentlemen.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.511
-(door closes)
-I think we're a little premature

21:02.594 --> 21:04.263
in filing for endangerment,
aren't we, Frank?

21:04.346 --> 21:06.473
-Have your men done a door to door?
-Of course.

21:06.556 --> 21:07.557
What did they get on the mother?

21:07.975 --> 21:09.434
Last seen yesterday morning.

21:09.935 --> 21:10.811
Two days!

21:10.894 --> 21:13.313
Dennis, I'd like to get the information
on the crime itself.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.943
Then I'd like to call my office. (sighs)
They were answering a prowler call?

21:18.318 --> 21:19.736
Some neighbor phoned it in.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.571
Turns out she has a history
of crank calls.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.699
Look, there's no question we're gonna have
to move on Perez.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.576
The point is we've got a separate
and legitimate endangerment complaint

21:26.660 --> 21:28.453
against the mother, so let's move on that!

21:28.537 --> 21:30.080
Take a little heat off
the department, right?

21:30.163 --> 21:31.456
And the Chief! You're damn right!

21:31.540 --> 21:34.126
Perez is your damn cop, Furillo.
Why don't you get behind him?

21:34.209 --> 21:36.670
How does supporting Perez
translate into crucifying--

21:36.753 --> 21:39.006
You listen to me. It's your precinct.

21:39.089 --> 21:41.174
Get a warrant out on this woman.
You pick her up.

21:41.258 --> 21:44.344
I won't have her treated like a criminal.
Where in the hell is your decency?

21:44.428 --> 21:46.138
Excuse me, Captain.
Hill and Renko just called.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.931
They're still at the premises.
Do you want them in?

21:48.015 --> 21:49.182
At the woman's apartment?

21:49.266 --> 21:50.726
Just tell them to wait there.

21:50.809 --> 21:54.104
Tell them to inform Mrs. Robson
and ask her please to come in.

21:54.187 --> 21:55.147
We can send over a warrant.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.316
No warrants.
Just tell them to bring her in.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.859
We want to ask her a couple of questions.

21:58.942 --> 22:01.737
-How is IAD coming with Perez?
-Just about finished.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.366
Tell Perez no statements.

22:10.078 --> 22:10.912
Ray...

22:20.672 --> 22:21.673
How's it going, Mike?

22:22.591 --> 22:23.592
Okay, Captain.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.178
Do you wanna talk?

22:27.054 --> 22:30.932
What's... What's the story?
Have they found the parents?

22:31.016 --> 22:33.018
There's a mother,
but they're still looking.

22:33.769 --> 22:34.936
Have you told Maria yet?

22:35.520 --> 22:36.938
<i>¿Quiera que yo lo haga?</i>

22:37.022 --> 22:39.066
No,<i> gracias. </i>I'll do it.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.694
It's just, um...
I'll do it a little later.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.199
They're gonna... put me on the desk, huh?

22:48.158 --> 22:50.202
They're gonna take you off
field duty for now.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.705
You can write up your report.

22:55.749 --> 22:56.625
Yes, sir.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.003
I just hope that people... understand.

23:01.671 --> 23:03.882
I... I believed there was a weapon.

23:19.189 --> 23:20.065
BOBBY: I don't know.

23:21.650 --> 23:25.028
Talked to him at the roll call.
He seemed fine. He seemed real steady.

23:26.113 --> 23:28.824
Yeah, just like my grandpapa used to say,

23:29.658 --> 23:32.869
"You can put your shoes in the oven,
but that don't make 'em biscuits."

23:33.161 --> 23:34.496
What's that supposed to mean?

23:35.664 --> 23:37.749
What it means is,
he could be real steady this morning,

23:37.833 --> 23:40.919
but that don't do that little boy
a lick of good this afternoon, does it?

23:46.508 --> 23:48.802
Ma'am, are you Mrs.-- Mrs. Robson?

23:49.344 --> 23:50.262
What's wrong?

23:50.345 --> 23:52.472
There's been a terrible accident, ma'am.
I'm afraid your--

23:52.556 --> 23:53.765
Jimmy!

23:53.849 --> 23:55.559
Ma'am. Ma'am, uh...

23:57.269 --> 23:59.438
I'm sorry, but your...
your boy's been shot.

24:05.235 --> 24:07.279
-Jimmy's dead?
-Yes, ma'am.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.370
I told him not to leave the apartment.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.956
-He promised me--
-He didn't leave, ma'am.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.584
Someone reported that there
was a problem on the premises,

24:20.667 --> 24:23.170
and a police officer came to look into it

24:23.253 --> 24:26.381
and mistook your son for the prowler.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.384
Your son had a toy gun
that appeared to be a real gun,

24:29.468 --> 24:33.221
and the police officer
accidentally... shot him.

24:33.722 --> 24:34.890
(crying)

24:38.310 --> 24:41.313
Oh... Oh, no.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.153
A police officer?

24:48.862 --> 24:49.738
Yes, ma'am.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.826
A police officer?

24:56.536 --> 24:57.370
Yes.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.707
(sobs)

25:03.960 --> 25:07.172
He's all I got in the world!

25:10.675 --> 25:11.635
Mrs. Robson...

25:12.594 --> 25:13.637
Mrs. Robson?

25:17.307 --> 25:20.519
We need to take you down to the station
to clear up some things.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.395
Can you come down there with us?

25:26.650 --> 25:27.859
Where's Jimmy now?

25:28.735 --> 25:30.070
They took him to the hospital.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.199
Is he all right?

25:37.702 --> 25:39.246
He's in the hospital morgue.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.048
I...

25:51.258 --> 25:52.634
Can I please go see him?

25:55.845 --> 25:57.305
We'll take you there on our way.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.477
I thought he would be all right.

26:03.770 --> 26:06.773
I told him-- I told him to stay inside.

26:14.656 --> 26:17.158
(car engine revving)

26:17.993 --> 26:20.287
(whistling)

26:21.454 --> 26:22.664
What do you want?

26:23.415 --> 26:25.125
Hey, what's happenin', sister?

26:25.875 --> 26:27.419
Lookin' for the lounge.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.797
Dude out there said I could eat
my sandwich in the employees' lounge.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.091
-Go ahead.
-All right.

26:34.342 --> 26:36.553
Let's see what we got here, now.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.513
Damn!

26:39.180 --> 26:42.058
Supposed to be ham and cheese.
Looks like it's just cheese.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.143
You want some?

26:46.563 --> 26:48.565
-Name's Steve.
-Vicki.

26:49.065 --> 26:50.525
I don't know about this place.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.986
That dude Murray,
what kind of jive is he into?

26:53.403 --> 26:55.363
"Bring the bucket, man!
Bring the bucket, man!"

26:55.447 --> 26:56.615
Up and down, up and down.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.408
Dude better not
be talking that jive to me!

26:58.491 --> 26:59.409
I'm gonna pop him!

27:02.162 --> 27:05.290
So, uh...
How long you had this gig, sister?

27:06.249 --> 27:07.459
Couple months.

27:07.834 --> 27:08.793
Dude pay?

27:08.877 --> 27:10.295
-Oh, yeah, he pay.
-(scoffs)

27:10.378 --> 27:13.006
Better not give him no noise, though,
'cause he'll fire your butt.

27:13.089 --> 27:15.216
Hey, I do my job, right?
I mean, I do my job.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.301
Yeah.

27:20.847 --> 27:22.098
I'll take some sandwich.

27:23.433 --> 27:24.392
All right, baby.

27:25.685 --> 27:28.897
But it ain't got no mustard.
I mean, it tastes just like gel, baby.

27:28.980 --> 27:29.939
No problem.

27:32.359 --> 27:33.193
Hey, uh...

27:34.569 --> 27:35.695
Look here, sister...

27:36.905 --> 27:37.739
Now, uh...

27:39.741 --> 27:42.994
You wouldn't know where a brother could
get high around here, would you?

27:43.078 --> 27:43.912
Could be.

27:46.247 --> 27:47.332
When's a good time?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.085
I'll find you.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.462
Hey, that's cool, baby.

27:53.254 --> 27:54.422
Check you out later.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.803
Hey, hey.
Save that one for later, all right?

28:02.222 --> 28:04.599
Hey, you hang loose, now, okay, baby?

28:05.558 --> 28:06.726
(humming)

28:15.068 --> 28:15.902
(laughs)

28:18.321 --> 28:19.781
(laughing)

28:31.793 --> 28:32.669
(door opens)

28:44.013 --> 28:44.889
(clears throat)

28:44.973 --> 28:46.474
(chattering)

28:47.392 --> 28:48.810
(door opens)

28:50.687 --> 28:51.563
(door closes)

29:20.383 --> 29:21.468
(thuds)

29:51.289 --> 29:52.373
(coins drop)

29:53.500 --> 29:54.793
Excuse me. (clears throat)

29:55.752 --> 29:57.170
That was rather clumsy.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.216
I'm your therapist. Liz.

30:03.635 --> 30:04.636
Oh, Liz?

30:05.887 --> 30:07.222
I thought Doreen was...

30:07.305 --> 30:09.849
You want Doreen?
Maybe she'll be back tomorrow.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.059
What's your name?

30:12.101 --> 30:12.977
Uh...

30:13.978 --> 30:14.813
Edward.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.689
(clears throat) Ed.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.275
So, uh, Ed...

30:19.859 --> 30:23.655
Anything you wanna talk to me about?
You wanna talk to me about your problem?

30:24.656 --> 30:26.783
-(coins clank)
-Well...

30:26.866 --> 30:27.909
(clears throat)

30:28.701 --> 30:29.619
I can't think--

30:29.911 --> 30:31.871
Seem to think of anything offhand.
(chuckles)

30:31.955 --> 30:33.957
You don't have to be shy with me, Ed.

30:37.585 --> 30:38.461
Well...

30:39.337 --> 30:43.174
I suppose my libido could stand
a little shoring up in the area of...

30:44.259 --> 30:45.844
reciprocal inhibition.

30:47.262 --> 30:50.223
I find it difficult sometimes
to settle the conflicts that arise

30:50.306 --> 30:54.394
from suppressed consummatory action
and genuine covert behavior.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.689
It's the fate of your ego ideal

30:57.772 --> 31:01.109
in your modern sexual arena, I realize,

31:01.442 --> 31:03.570
and yet, like the god Janus,

31:03.653 --> 31:08.324
(stutters)
I seem always to be looking back

31:08.408 --> 31:10.326
at the sublimations of the past.

31:10.743 --> 31:12.745
Come on, honey. We're wasting time here.

31:12.829 --> 31:15.081
Let me have a peek
at your<i> real </i>problem, huh?

31:16.124 --> 31:18.543
I want you to tell me
what happened, Mrs. Robson.

31:22.297 --> 31:23.464
Nothing to tell.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.595
Why did you leave your son
alone in the apartment?

31:33.391 --> 31:35.852
I had to go stand in line for a job.

31:38.104 --> 31:42.483
They were only taking the first 20 people,
so I had to get there early as I could.

31:43.026 --> 31:43.860
I see.

31:45.069 --> 31:47.447
Uh, what job? Where did you stand in line?

31:47.822 --> 31:51.534
Excuse me. Let's make this clear.
Is my client under arrest or not?

31:51.618 --> 31:52.619
She is not.

31:52.702 --> 31:53.912
Is she free to leave?

31:55.872 --> 31:56.748
Not at this time.

31:58.041 --> 32:01.336
Mrs. Robson, I'd advise you not to answer
any further questions.

32:02.295 --> 32:03.504
What's the difference?

32:04.130 --> 32:05.882
If they ask me, I'll answer them.

32:07.383 --> 32:09.427
The gas company had the jobs.

32:10.053 --> 32:12.305
And why didn't you have
someone stay with your son?

32:16.726 --> 32:18.394
I couldn't afford a sitter.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.858
I was already owing her $2.

32:27.570 --> 32:29.072
My boy was hungry,

32:29.906 --> 32:30.865
and...

32:31.824 --> 32:34.786
if I didn't get a job,
he wasn't gonna eat.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.043
Are you saying that I killed my boy?

32:43.753 --> 32:45.713
Are you saying that I killed him?

32:46.464 --> 32:50.134
Mrs. Robson, these men
are your enemies right now.

32:50.218 --> 32:52.178
They brought you here
to make you a scapegoat.

32:52.679 --> 32:55.098
I did leave him alone, didn't I?

32:58.351 --> 33:00.603
In what condition was the boy...

33:01.938 --> 33:03.314
your son, when you left?

33:06.567 --> 33:07.568
Was he asleep?

33:09.112 --> 33:09.946
No.

33:13.533 --> 33:14.826
He gets up with me.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.373
But he won't be getting up anymore.

33:23.042 --> 33:24.460
I won't have to feed him.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.088
Go on, please.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.008
Um...

33:32.010 --> 33:35.888
Before I left this morning, I...

33:36.681 --> 33:40.268
I sat down and I talked to him
for a real long time.

33:41.352 --> 33:42.186
And...

33:43.980 --> 33:48.943
I said, "Jimmy, are you gonna be
a good boy while your mommy's gone?

33:50.737 --> 33:54.407
You can't go climbing around
and getting into things."

33:57.076 --> 33:58.995
And then he said,

33:59.328 --> 34:00.371
"Yes, ma'am."

34:01.914 --> 34:02.790
And...

34:04.000 --> 34:06.961
And I left him... and...

34:08.296 --> 34:09.547
Oh, my God!

34:09.714 --> 34:11.883
(sobs) Oh, God!

34:11.966 --> 34:15.762
They can do anything they want to me
if it brings my baby back!

34:15.845 --> 34:17.805
I killed him!

34:18.306 --> 34:20.391
I killed my baby!

34:20.808 --> 34:22.477
(crying)

34:26.064 --> 34:27.356
I think we're done now.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.150
(telephones ringing)

34:34.489 --> 34:35.698
We've got enough to file.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.950
When she comes out of the room,
I want her transferred to Michigan Avenue.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.077
On what charge?

34:39.160 --> 34:41.537
Based on her admission in that room,

34:41.621 --> 34:44.665
we can make child abandonment
and felony endangerment stick.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.668
I'm sorry, Frank. I've got my orders.

34:48.211 --> 34:51.172
City Corporation Counsel's
also in favor, and most of all,

34:51.464 --> 34:52.965
your own department is pushing it.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.509
You don't think the press and public

34:54.592 --> 34:56.219
are gonna know exactly
what you're trying to do?

34:56.719 --> 34:57.845
And what's that, Furillo?

34:57.929 --> 35:00.431
Divert attention
from a tragic police involvement,

35:00.515 --> 35:02.433
avoid a major lawsuit against the city.

35:02.517 --> 35:05.645
You're making a lot of uninformed
assumptions there, Frank.

35:06.687 --> 35:08.064
Sorry. We're gonna arrest your client.

35:08.147 --> 35:10.358
Charge is child abandonment
and endangerment.

35:10.441 --> 35:11.651
I don't believe this.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.862
I'll make it as easy as I possibly can.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.200
God, isn't there any common
decency left in the world?

35:19.909 --> 35:22.286
It's all political hatchet-work
for Daniels, isn't it?

35:22.370 --> 35:25.248
The arraignment's this afternoon.
She's in custody until then.

35:25.873 --> 35:29.627
Good. You'll have time to shave her head
and tattoo a number on her arm.

35:47.728 --> 35:49.063
Mrs. Robson?

35:51.315 --> 35:52.692
You shot my boy.

35:54.861 --> 35:56.654
I've got a little boy of my own...

35:58.156 --> 36:00.658
and if anything were to happen to him,
I'd die.

36:03.369 --> 36:04.245
I'm sorry.

36:04.912 --> 36:05.997
I'm sorry!

36:08.124 --> 36:09.917
The Lord is forgiveness.

36:13.045 --> 36:14.213
But I killed him!

36:14.839 --> 36:16.090
I shot him!

36:16.799 --> 36:17.800
I know.

36:19.343 --> 36:22.305
I know it wasn't in your heart
to hurt my Jimmy.

36:24.974 --> 36:26.559
We both have to live with it.

36:31.147 --> 36:32.315
I don't hate you.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.400
Mrs. Robson, will you come
with me, please?

36:50.374 --> 36:52.168
(telephone ringing)

36:52.251 --> 36:53.419
Your office, Frank?

37:03.387 --> 37:05.056
According to what I've managed
to piece together,

37:05.139 --> 37:07.850
you raided a porno supermarket
in Midtown this morning,

37:07.934 --> 37:10.519
made arrests and put
four of your men on the premises.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.064
I can hazard a good guess
as to what's going on,

37:13.147 --> 37:14.398
but I think I should hear it from you.

37:14.482 --> 37:17.652
-That operation's a week old, hoss.
-The hell it is.

37:17.735 --> 37:19.320
It's a cheap, shoddy attempt

37:19.403 --> 37:22.406
to put a feather
in Candidate Daniels' cap on election day,

37:22.698 --> 37:25.034
and I'm tempted to holler
the whole thing to the press.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.495
I think you can only hurt yourself
by doing that, hoss.

37:27.578 --> 37:30.373
Daniels will just blame you
for endangering the operation.

37:30.790 --> 37:34.168
-I'm sorry you weren't told, but--
-Frank? Excuse me.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.128
We have a serious problem downstairs.

37:36.921 --> 37:37.755
I'm sorry, Ozzie.

37:42.593 --> 37:43.719
(water running)

37:49.100 --> 37:50.685
He won't come out, Captain.

37:53.771 --> 37:55.690
Mike, I'm gonna help you
out of there, okay?

37:56.732 --> 37:57.733
Captain...

37:59.819 --> 38:04.490
Captain, my weapon was discharged.
He was still alive.

38:05.241 --> 38:06.492
He looked at me.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.620
He was holding my leg and...

38:10.288 --> 38:13.499
He was looking up at me
as if I could help him.

38:14.375 --> 38:18.129
He continued to hold my leg, and...

38:18.212 --> 38:19.797
(stutters) He was...

38:19.880 --> 38:23.050
He was holding it like... like this.

38:23.551 --> 38:26.012
Michael, let's stand up, okay?

38:26.887 --> 38:27.763
All right?

38:32.893 --> 38:33.978
Get him dried off.

38:34.061 --> 38:36.439
I'm okay, Captain. I'm okay.

38:36.522 --> 38:39.150
I just... wanna go home for a while.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.153
-Bobby...
-Yeah?

38:42.236 --> 38:43.154
Bobby...

38:43.612 --> 38:46.157
Call his wife, Ray.
Send him home with a couple of uniforms.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.326
Tell them not to leave
till she gets there.

38:57.460 --> 39:01.047
-How you feeling?
-Tape's a little tight, but I'm okay.

39:01.130 --> 39:03.174
-You sure?
-I'm fine.

39:03.674 --> 39:05.051
Hey, Andy, how's Perez?

39:05.676 --> 39:06.635
Took him home.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.721
-You tell his wife?
-Yeah, we told her.

39:08.804 --> 39:10.264
Poor guy just freaked out.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.475
Well, he's been
under a lot of pressure lately.

39:12.558 --> 39:15.603
That restaurant thing,
them debts get to you.

39:15.686 --> 39:18.230
When you start out wound a couple notches
too tight to begin with,

39:18.314 --> 39:19.648
you go into a dark room--

39:19.732 --> 39:21.150
And what, J.D.? And what?

39:21.233 --> 39:22.985
Nothing, Luce, just nothing.

39:23.069 --> 39:25.071
If you're saying he killed the kid
because of home problems,

39:25.154 --> 39:26.030
that's a crock.

39:26.113 --> 39:27.239
Take it easy, Luce.

39:27.323 --> 39:29.367
No, you take it easy! You take it easy!

39:29.950 --> 39:31.160
I killed a kid once.

39:31.243 --> 39:33.245
It had nothing to do with the rest
of my life. It just happens.

39:33.329 --> 39:35.748
There's a situation,
you use your judgment, and that's it.

39:35.831 --> 39:37.291
You're right, Luce. You're right.

39:38.084 --> 39:39.001
It happens.

39:39.585 --> 39:42.630
I think Mike deserves better
than us second-guessing him.

39:43.464 --> 39:45.049
No argument there, babe.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.134
Joe...

39:49.512 --> 39:51.472
I think I have to go to the hospital...

39:52.348 --> 39:54.308
'cause I can't... breathe.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.145
Just take it easy there. Come on.

40:00.106 --> 40:02.650
(wheezing)

40:04.318 --> 40:05.361
Three bucks' worth.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.571
Stand further away from me.

40:13.035 --> 40:15.538
-(coughs)
-(money rustles)

40:15.996 --> 40:18.374
(whistling)

40:18.457 --> 40:21.544
-NEAL: Oh, 'scuse me, y'all.
-Hey, get lost, Jim.

40:21.627 --> 40:24.588
He's all right, Chris.
He's just a junkie mopper.

40:24.672 --> 40:25.506
I gotta leave.

40:26.340 --> 40:28.801
Hey, sweet cakes, I got a job for you.

40:28.884 --> 40:31.637
-I already got a job.
-Then you're gonna double up.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.597
Got a package for our Chicago friend.

40:33.681 --> 40:36.350
Come Monday,
you're gonna take a bus ride. Got that?

40:37.852 --> 40:40.396
Mm-hm. That's my sugar.

40:43.482 --> 40:44.567
You want something, Jim?

40:49.405 --> 40:51.991
Want me to tell you about it, Jim,
tell you how it is?

40:52.491 --> 40:54.410
-(gasps)
-You keep an eye on my lady.

40:54.493 --> 40:57.663
You tell me if anybody tries
to get evil with her. You got that, Jim?

41:02.877 --> 41:03.711
Monday, baby.

41:04.545 --> 41:05.713
I'm coming for you.

41:06.172 --> 41:07.006
(scoffs)

41:09.508 --> 41:10.593
(door opens)

41:11.719 --> 41:12.553
(door closes)

41:13.762 --> 41:17.516
Okay, sister. We got a whole new situation
here now, baby.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.768
Look, nothing bad's gonna happen to you.

41:19.852 --> 41:22.605
I'm not gonna bust you.
Unless, of course, you don't help me out.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.231
(stutters) What do you want?

41:24.857 --> 41:25.816
Quincy.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.527
WOMAN (over P.A.):
<i>Nurse Mangero, report to O.B. stat...</i>

41:29.403 --> 41:31.155
-What's that?
-What does it look like?

41:32.698 --> 41:33.532
A shiv.

41:33.908 --> 41:34.783
You got it.

41:36.202 --> 41:37.077
What are you gonna do with it?

41:37.161 --> 41:38.829
Standard operating procedure.

41:39.371 --> 41:43.167
Make a small incision so we can pressurize
the chest wall and inflate your lung.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.544
-Can you feel that?
-Mm-mm.

41:45.628 --> 41:46.629
-Is that good?
-Yep.

41:47.087 --> 41:50.132
That cracked rib gave us a very small
puncture, and that's the problem.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.634
Like a balloon.

41:51.717 --> 41:52.927
That's the idea.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.639
-Hurts to talk, doesn't it?
-Mm-hmm.

41:56.722 --> 41:57.973
So I'll talk.

42:00.351 --> 42:01.644
We're gonna put this tube in...

42:02.520 --> 42:04.897
and pump your chest up
with that gizmo there.

42:05.731 --> 42:07.274
It'll hurt a little bit, but not a lot.

42:12.613 --> 42:13.989
Then in a few days...

42:16.784 --> 42:18.160
Maybe you'll let me
take you out to dinner.

42:19.203 --> 42:20.996
(chuckles)

42:22.456 --> 42:23.707
A pass?

42:24.542 --> 42:28.462
Officer Bates, I am an honorable man.
Tell her, nurse.

42:29.046 --> 42:31.924
-He's a<i> very </i>honorable man.
-Thank you.

42:32.925 --> 42:34.468
When are you gonna put the tube in?

42:36.178 --> 42:38.430
-It's in.
-Hmm?

42:39.557 --> 42:40.391
Feel better?

42:42.226 --> 42:43.060
Yeah.

42:43.477 --> 42:44.311
Good.

42:46.105 --> 42:48.065
We're gonna be admitting you
for a few days now.

42:48.649 --> 42:49.650
No way.

42:50.442 --> 42:52.194
Wait a minute. I'm the doctor here.

42:52.444 --> 42:54.530
Besides, I'm on all night.
I'll come in and see you.

42:55.531 --> 42:56.365
Okay?

42:57.408 --> 42:58.242
Yeah.

42:59.702 --> 43:00.536
(sighs)

43:01.620 --> 43:02.663
Okay.

43:03.122 --> 43:04.748
Your mouth is gonna be kind of dry.

43:06.959 --> 43:07.876
Would you like a Popsicle?

43:10.796 --> 43:11.797
What kind would you like?

43:12.673 --> 43:13.507
(sighs)

43:14.633 --> 43:15.551
Banana.

43:18.262 --> 43:19.471
Banana it is.

43:24.643 --> 43:26.437
Do we have an ROR report?

43:27.605 --> 43:30.691
Your Honor, the report shows
the same address for three years,

43:31.483 --> 43:34.987
ties to the community, and, of course,
no prior criminal involvement.

43:35.070 --> 43:37.197
Emphasize the confession of absenteeism.

43:37.781 --> 43:38.907
We've got the statement.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.285
Will you identify yourself
for the court, sir?

43:46.290 --> 43:48.125
Deputy Chief Dennis Mahoney.

43:48.626 --> 43:51.170
Chief Mahoney,
District Attorney Bernstein,

43:51.253 --> 43:52.838
Ms. Davenport, if you'll approach.

44:00.387 --> 44:02.097
This is something out of Kafka.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.391
Judge, we have a felony endangerment--

44:04.475 --> 44:07.770
Your Honor, this woman's son
was shot and killed this morning.

44:08.604 --> 44:12.566
Leaving aside for the moment
the fact that these charges are a crock,

44:13.484 --> 44:15.319
there's the matter of her
arranging a funeral.

44:16.403 --> 44:18.822
I petition for immediate
recognizance release.

44:19.198 --> 44:20.032
Objection?

44:21.075 --> 44:21.909
No.

44:22.910 --> 44:24.703
Irwin, all I'm going to say is,

44:24.787 --> 44:27.831
you better have something to show me
when we go to Substance.

44:28.707 --> 44:30.000
Step back.

44:32.961 --> 44:36.090
Preliminary hearing, 72 hours.

44:37.424 --> 44:39.635
The defendant is released
on her own recognizance.

44:41.637 --> 44:42.680
Mrs. Robson...

44:43.555 --> 44:45.724
the court's deepest
sympathies are with you.

44:48.769 --> 44:49.770
Thank you, sir.

44:51.772 --> 44:52.981
Recess, ten minutes.

44:57.361 --> 44:59.988
Irwin... We'll get you Substance.

45:09.456 --> 45:10.791
(murmuring)

45:15.462 --> 45:18.006
Sorry. Stuck in traffic.

45:18.090 --> 45:19.216
Oh, that's okay.

45:20.134 --> 45:21.468
She just fell asleep.

45:23.470 --> 45:25.264
-Rough, huh?
-Yeah.

45:26.056 --> 45:26.890
We all ready?

45:27.349 --> 45:30.352
Well, you know, they have to take me out
in a wheelchair, insurance.

45:30.436 --> 45:31.353
Right, okay.

45:38.402 --> 45:39.653
Are you okay, Henry?

45:40.821 --> 45:42.072
You look a little ragged.

45:43.115 --> 45:44.116
Uh...

45:46.410 --> 45:48.287
One of our cops...

45:48.746 --> 45:50.456
Killed a child today, I heard.

45:52.458 --> 45:53.542
Could have been Josh.

45:54.585 --> 45:55.836
Could have been Frank Jr.

45:56.253 --> 45:58.589
I know. It's horrible.

45:59.840 --> 46:00.799
But...

46:01.592 --> 46:02.468
What?

46:03.260 --> 46:05.804
Well, nobody can help that child anymore.

46:06.013 --> 46:07.181
I mean, I just think that...

46:08.724 --> 46:11.018
we have to hold on to and be thankful

46:11.101 --> 46:13.312
for all the children
that are alive in the world.

46:14.438 --> 46:16.023
It's the only way we can live finely.

46:20.861 --> 46:21.695
Can I hold her?

46:34.541 --> 46:35.501
There you go.

46:41.465 --> 46:42.508
JOYCE: The veal that bad?

46:42.591 --> 46:44.426
No, the veal's fine. It's good.

46:45.886 --> 46:46.804
(sighs)

46:47.596 --> 46:48.555
Yeah, I know.

46:50.098 --> 46:51.266
I can't eat either.

46:52.893 --> 46:55.229
The thought of arresting
that boy's mother...

46:56.772 --> 47:00.192
-They'll dismiss at the preliminary.
-I gave the order to take her, you know.

47:01.109 --> 47:03.862
Frank, when I defend some creep...

47:04.947 --> 47:06.907
you understand that it's part of my job.

47:07.825 --> 47:08.659
Of course.

47:11.078 --> 47:13.413
And you don't decide
whether to forgive me.

47:14.915 --> 47:16.875
You don't expect me to apologize.

47:18.502 --> 47:19.378
No.

47:22.506 --> 47:24.007
Well, we're married, pizza man.

47:26.134 --> 47:27.094
I love you.

47:28.554 --> 47:29.638
I know what you do.

47:30.222 --> 47:31.348
I know your integrity.

47:33.016 --> 47:34.852
It's about an inch away from my heart.

47:37.646 --> 47:40.941
-Thank you.
-(telephone rings)

47:44.486 --> 47:45.362
Furillo.

47:46.029 --> 47:46.905
When?

47:48.282 --> 47:49.241
I'll be right there.

47:53.328 --> 47:54.454
Where are my keys?

47:56.248 --> 47:57.541
Perez tried to hang himself.

47:59.585 --> 48:01.336
Where'd I put them?
Damn it, they were right here.

48:01.420 --> 48:02.337
Under the mail.

48:04.006 --> 48:04.840
I love you.

48:07.593 --> 48:08.510
I'll be late.

48:23.317 --> 48:26.320
(closing theme playing)
