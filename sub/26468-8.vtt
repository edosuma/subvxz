Help!

Jonah!

00:09.540 --> 00:10.710
Help.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.460
-You okay?
-No.

00:12.460 --> 00:14.880
-Okay, I'm gonna go
get some help.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.620
T.J.'s not sitting
with his friends.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.920
I'm just gonna do
a quick walk-by,
make sure he's okay.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.000
Amber:
Buffy broke girl code.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.920
What exactly is the code?

00:25.920 --> 00:27.000
You don't go out
with someone

00:27.000 --> 00:28.330
after they been
with your best friend.

00:28.330 --> 00:30.670
I knew something
felt off.

00:30.670 --> 00:32.080
Now you know what.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.920
How did that happen?

00:33.920 --> 00:34.830
How did what happen?

00:34.830 --> 00:37.330
Buffy:
Andi's in a canoe
with Amber.

00:48.420 --> 00:50.920
You are using
my charger.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.500
Hey!

00:52.500 --> 00:54.290
Take your 2%

00:55.330 --> 00:57.250
How do you even know
that's your charger?

00:57.250 --> 00:59.420
See the pink tape
wrapper around the plug?

00:59.420 --> 01:03.290
I marked it to avoid
this exact situation.

01:03.290 --> 01:05.120
Well, where's my charger?

01:17.380 --> 01:18.880
Oh, good.
You found it.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.960
This one...

01:20.960 --> 01:22.710
Also has pink tape on it.

01:23.830 --> 01:24.880
Huh.

01:24.880 --> 01:27.500
Is anyone missing
a charger?

01:27.500 --> 01:30.290
I found one
with pink tape on it.

01:30.290 --> 01:33.460
You put pink tape
on all the chargers,
didn't you?

01:36.710 --> 01:39.210

"You are cordially

02:48.460 --> 02:49.540
What's that?

02:49.540 --> 02:50.960
DanceDance
is like Sundance.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.040
Except it takes place
in my living room

02:53.040 --> 02:54.960
and only shows
dance movies.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.960
Ooh. Tell me the lineup.

Center Stage,
Save the Last Dance,

02:59.210 --> 03:01.790
Step Up, one through four,
Step Up 3D...

03:01.790 --> 03:04.290
Twice because
it's the best one.

03:04.290 --> 03:05.790
-Obviously.
-(laughing)

03:05.790 --> 03:07.420
And Footloose.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.750
Me and my Sunday
shoes are in.

03:09.750 --> 03:11.000
Good.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.580
Because it's been way
too long since we hung out.

03:12.580 --> 03:13.670
Just the two of us.

03:13.670 --> 03:15.250
Oh no.

03:15.250 --> 03:16.080
What?

03:16.080 --> 03:17.670
This says tomorrow night.

03:18.750 --> 03:20.250
I have plans
tomorrow night.

03:20.250 --> 03:21.250
With who?

03:22.620 --> 03:24.080
Amber.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.750
Oh.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.750
Well, what
about tonight?

03:27.750 --> 03:30.120
I have plans tonight.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.080
With who?

03:33.420 --> 03:34.330
Walker.

03:35.620 --> 03:36.420
Oh.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.920
Amber's taking me
to a party.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.250
I'm sure you could come.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.500
I don't want to
tag along

03:42.500 --> 03:44.290
to a party I wasn't
invited to.

03:47.420 --> 03:49.000
Well, we'll do it
another time.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.880
I was just about
to say that.

03:52.540 --> 03:54.620
What about next weekend?

03:54.620 --> 03:55.620
Let's make a plan.

03:55.620 --> 03:57.290
(sighs)

03:57.290 --> 03:59.670
I never thought we'd
have to make a plan.

03:59.670 --> 04:00.790
I know.

04:00.790 --> 04:02.120
What are we? 20?

04:02.120 --> 04:03.500
(both laugh)

04:05.960 --> 04:06.960
-Yep.
-Yeah.

04:15.170 --> 04:16.210
Will you hold my foot?

04:17.540 --> 04:18.620
(chuckles)

04:20.290 --> 04:21.620
You want me
to massage it?

04:21.620 --> 04:22.620
Nah. Just hold it.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.500
I feel like we're
an old married couple.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.040
Okay, fine.
Don't hold my foot.

04:30.040 --> 04:33.000
No, I like it.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.880
Imagining us...

04:34.880 --> 04:36.080
As an old married couple.

04:37.420 --> 04:39.330
We'd be pretty cute.

04:39.330 --> 04:41.380
Swiping sugar packets
from restaurants.

04:41.380 --> 04:43.710
Driving 30 miles an hour
down the freeway.

04:43.710 --> 04:45.670
With the blinker on,
just...

04:45.670 --> 04:47.580
You'll look good
with grey hair.

04:49.500 --> 04:50.670
I could see you
as a grandma.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.580
Ugh! That was
a little too real.

04:54.580 --> 04:55.670
Yeah, we need
to get out more.

04:55.670 --> 04:56.920
-Tomorrow!
-What's tomorrow?

04:56.920 --> 04:59.170
Oh, Andi's spending
the night at Amber's.

04:59.170 --> 05:00.540
We could do something.

05:00.540 --> 05:01.830
Ohh.

05:01.830 --> 05:02.920
Okay.

05:04.670 --> 05:05.710
I got this.

05:05.710 --> 05:07.170
What do ya got?

05:08.500 --> 05:09.500
An idea.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.670
I'll plan
the whole thing.

05:12.670 --> 05:13.790
It'll be a surprise.

05:13.790 --> 05:15.210
-Really?
-Mh-hm.

05:15.210 --> 05:16.540
Okay.

05:17.710 --> 05:19.750
This is exciting.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.380
Nothing too fancy
though, okay?

05:22.710 --> 05:25.460
I am not saying
a thing.

05:25.460 --> 05:26.620
Oh.

05:26.620 --> 05:28.960
Keeping it
a total mystery, huh?

05:28.960 --> 05:30.040
That's fine with me.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.040
As long as it's not
that rock climbing wall.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.210
You're no fun.

05:34.210 --> 05:36.540
Or...

05:36.540 --> 05:38.460
Maybe I'm a lot of fun.

05:39.790 --> 05:41.750

'Cause you've never

06:07.080 --> 06:09.500

my stepdad was using it

to play with his

06:11.330 --> 06:13.330

-Yeah, me too.

06:25.290 --> 06:26.670

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Here you go.

07:08.380 --> 07:11.000
I just remembered,
I'm supposed to be somewhere.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.380
Where?

07:12.380 --> 07:14.790
Um... Haircut!

07:14.790 --> 07:16.880
Are you upset
that I'm winning?

07:16.880 --> 07:18.330
No, of course not.

07:18.330 --> 07:20.080
Ooh, I think he is upset.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.330
Look at that face
he's pulling.

07:21.330 --> 07:23.000
That's because
you're here,
if you want to know.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.830
Hey, that thing
that happened

07:24.830 --> 07:26.880
with T.J. and his friends,
we worked that out.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.380
It's got nothing
to do with that.

07:28.380 --> 07:30.080
Then, what is it?

07:30.080 --> 07:31.500
Ask him.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.500
What is it?
What did you do?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.830
I have no idea.

07:50.750 --> 07:53.210
Why didn't you tell me
T.J. was coming?

07:53.210 --> 07:54.830
I didn't think I had to.

07:54.830 --> 07:58.210
You like everyone,
everyone likes you.

07:58.210 --> 08:00.420
T.J.'s kinda between
friends right now.

08:00.420 --> 08:01.920
I can't help you.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.460
I'll never be friends
with that guy.

08:05.420 --> 08:06.420
Why not?

08:07.920 --> 08:09.040
Long story.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.460
That's...
Kind of embarrassing.

08:13.540 --> 08:14.920
Come on.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.040
JB.

08:18.710 --> 08:19.710
It's CG.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.960
It goes all the way back
to Little League.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.250
Little League?

08:24.250 --> 08:25.750
Were you two
rivals or something?

08:25.750 --> 08:27.880
The opposite, actually.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.540
We were on the same team.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.080
I love baseball.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.710
I thought that was
going to be my sport.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.960
I wanted to be a legend
like Roberto Clemente.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.380
I even got his number,
21, on my jersey.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.830
But I never got to
wear that jersey.

08:48.830 --> 08:50.620
Somebody stole it.

08:50.620 --> 08:51.920
Care to guess who
that somebody was?

08:56.920 --> 08:58.670
T.J.?

08:58.670 --> 09:00.080
-Yeah.
-Why?

09:00.080 --> 09:02.250
-Let me finish.
-Please do.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.790
I very politely tell him...

09:05.580 --> 09:06.920
"That's my jersey."

09:06.920 --> 09:08.920
He's like, "No, it's not.
It's mine."

09:08.920 --> 09:10.420
I say, "Ask the coach."

09:10.420 --> 09:11.920
But T.J. refuses, so...

09:11.920 --> 09:13.420
I say, "I'll ask the coach."

09:13.420 --> 09:15.830
Then T.J. goes:
"Is the coach your dad?"

09:18.250 --> 09:20.830
It just so happened
my dad was the coach.

09:20.830 --> 09:23.620
Ooh, I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

09:23.620 --> 09:26.830
"Wittle baby has to wun
and get his daddy!

09:26.830 --> 09:28.290
He's angwee."

09:28.290 --> 09:31.040
And I was angwee!
I mean, angry.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.830
So I yelled, "Just give me
back my jersey!"

09:32.830 --> 09:36.380
"Oh, is Wittle Baby
gonna cwy now?"

09:36.380 --> 09:37.830
Did you cry?

09:37.830 --> 09:39.170
There's no crying
in baseball.

09:39.170 --> 09:40.710
That's not
an actual rule.

09:40.710 --> 09:41.960
Yes, it is.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.500
That's just a line
from a movie.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.210
Are you and I going to
fight about this now?

09:45.210 --> 09:47.880
No, no. Sorry.
What did you do?

09:49.620 --> 09:50.620
I shoved him.

09:53.710 --> 09:55.170
He shoved me back.

09:55.170 --> 09:57.330
The other kids were yelling,
"Fight, fight, fight!"

09:57.330 --> 09:59.460
"Fight, fight,
fight, fight!"

09:59.460 --> 10:00.790
We didn't fight.

10:00.790 --> 10:01.830
-The coach--
-Your dad.

10:01.830 --> 10:03.620
Right. He put a stop to it.

10:03.620 --> 10:05.080
He needed the team
to get along.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.540
He said it would help
if I just wore another jersey.

10:08.540 --> 10:10.000
So I did, but...

10:10.000 --> 10:12.880
Every game, I had to see
T.J. wearing my number.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.000
So, what happened
the next year?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
I didn't go back.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.040
I never played
Little League again.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.080
Or basketball
or football.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.670
Why not?

10:24.670 --> 10:27.710
I didn't want to be
on a team with T.J.
or any of his friends.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.830
I mean, he became
this star athlete.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.170
So did you.

10:31.170 --> 10:32.210
On the Space Otters.

10:32.210 --> 10:34.580
I love Ultimate,
but...

10:34.580 --> 10:36.040
It would have been nice
to play a real sport.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.580
You always say
Ultimate is a real sport.

10:38.580 --> 10:40.170
Yeah.

10:40.170 --> 10:41.210
But, come on.

10:41.210 --> 10:43.170
So, this was never
resolved?

10:44.330 --> 10:47.080
No, and I know
what you're thinking.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.040
This is a stupid grudge
and I should have gotten
over it by now.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.250
No.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.380
No, it's not stupid.

10:53.380 --> 10:56.920
Clearly, this was
and important moment
in your life.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.210
Without it, you might
have been a completely
different person.

10:59.210 --> 11:00.380
What do you mean?

11:00.380 --> 11:01.920
Think about it.

11:01.920 --> 11:05.710
You're the nicest person
anyone's ever met.

11:05.710 --> 11:07.250
Maybe it's because
you don't want anyone

11:07.250 --> 11:08.710
to feel the way
you did that day.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.040
I don't.

11:11.210 --> 11:12.380
The question is:

11:13.580 --> 11:14.880
Why did T.J. do it?

11:17.710 --> 11:18.790
He's mean.

11:18.790 --> 11:20.380
He's always
been mean.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.250
Eh, it's just his face.

11:22.250 --> 11:24.380
He's really not
so mean anymore.

11:26.040 --> 11:26.960
You know,
this is the first time

11:26.960 --> 11:28.460
I ever talked about this.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.960
I'm glad we had
this conversation.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.330
Me too.

11:33.330 --> 11:35.080
I'm ready to let it go.

11:37.420 --> 11:38.460
I'm not.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.420
Amber:
So, what's the latest

11:47.420 --> 11:50.580
on the whole
Buffy-Walker
situation?

11:50.580 --> 11:52.790
Still a situation.

11:52.790 --> 11:54.750
Girl Code's still
being broken?

11:54.750 --> 11:57.080
Technically, I guess.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.750
Although, I don't know,
maybe some of this girl stuff

11:59.750 --> 12:01.920
is not so cut and dry.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.170
Maybe it should be called,
Girl Recommendations

12:04.170 --> 12:06.960
or Girl Loose Guidelines.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.170
That's the one problem
with Girl Code.

12:09.170 --> 12:12.170
A little too
open to interpretation.

12:12.170 --> 12:13.120
It should come
with a label.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.500
"The following codes
are merely suggestions.

12:15.500 --> 12:18.120
Girl Code may result
in nausea, insecurity,

12:18.120 --> 12:20.210
loss of sleep,
and weight gain.

12:20.210 --> 12:22.120
Be careful when
using Girl Code."

12:22.120 --> 12:24.210
"Girl Code is not available
in all 50 states.

12:24.210 --> 12:25.960
Results may vary.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.000
If side effects occur,
please consult your
other girlfriends."

12:28.000 --> 12:29.620
(both giggle)

12:29.620 --> 12:33.040
-Where are we?
-You'll see.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.620
(electronic music playing)

12:38.620 --> 12:40.290
This is the party?

12:40.290 --> 12:42.710
Yeah, isn't it cool?

12:42.710 --> 12:44.210
It's a warehouse.

12:44.210 --> 12:45.960
So?

12:45.960 --> 12:48.830
I'm used to parties
with silly string,
accessible bathrooms

12:48.830 --> 12:51.170
and my mother DJ'ing!

12:51.170 --> 12:52.670
That guys has a beard.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.880
Welcome to your first
high school party.

12:56.880 --> 12:59.210
This is a high school party?

12:59.210 --> 13:01.830
I'm not ready
for a high school party.

13:01.830 --> 13:05.170
Don't worry, Bambi.
I'll protect you.

13:05.170 --> 13:06.170
(music continues)

13:10.710 --> 13:12.080
(music intensifies)

13:13.540 --> 13:15.170
-Isn't this cool?
-What?

13:16.170 --> 13:17.830
Are you having fun?

13:19.710 --> 13:20.830
You will!

13:20.830 --> 13:23.170
I was just like you
the first time I came.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.420
Come on!

13:28.500 --> 13:30.540
(music continues)

13:36.040 --> 13:37.290
Andi: Oh.
(giggles nervously)

13:40.120 --> 13:41.920
Okay, excuse me.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.080
Oh!

13:44.080 --> 13:45.790
Amber.
We got separated.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.040
Sorry.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.210
I've always wanted
to do this.

14:09.210 --> 14:10.960
I know.

14:10.960 --> 14:12.710
Sorry it took 15 years.

14:12.710 --> 14:14.040
It was worth the wait.

14:15.330 --> 14:16.420
Yeah?

14:18.330 --> 14:21.120
-(phone beeps)
-Agh. It's, uh...

14:22.420 --> 14:23.750
It's Andi.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.670
"I'm at a warehouse party.

14:25.670 --> 14:28.290
I lost Amber.
I don't know how
to get home."

14:28.290 --> 14:30.170
What?

14:30.170 --> 14:32.250
She-- She dropped
a pin.

14:32.250 --> 14:33.790
Excuse me, sir.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.500
Can you take us
to this address?

14:35.500 --> 14:37.000
Rerouting.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.960
What is she doing
at a warehouse party?

14:38.960 --> 14:40.830
Let's focus
on the good news.
She texted us.

14:40.830 --> 14:42.420
She wants us
to come get her.

14:42.420 --> 14:43.830
(sighs)

14:43.830 --> 14:45.960
Is this as fast
as we can go?

14:45.960 --> 14:47.960
I can't believe I'm finally
on a carriage ride

14:47.960 --> 14:49.750
the one night
I don't want to be
on a carriage ride.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.170
Alright.

14:51.170 --> 14:52.250
Don't worry.
I got this.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.960
Excuse me, drive.
Stop please.

14:53.960 --> 14:54.960
Please stop.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.210
What are you
gonna do?

14:57.210 --> 14:58.210
Run.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.290
Text me when
you find her.

15:01.290 --> 15:03.330
I will.

15:03.330 --> 15:04.170
Bowie!

15:07.960 --> 15:09.880
What?

15:09.880 --> 15:11.380
You're killing it
as a dad.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.290
(sweet music playing)

15:17.960 --> 15:19.040
Go get our girl.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.460
(electronic music playing)

15:49.420 --> 15:50.710
What took you
so long?

15:50.710 --> 15:52.330
I ran all the way here.

15:52.330 --> 15:54.210
Why didn't you drive?

15:54.210 --> 15:56.380
Thanks for coming
to rescue me, Dad.

15:56.380 --> 15:57.920
You're my hero, Dad.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.500
That too.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.710
Let's get out of here.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.750
Amber:
Andi?

16:03.750 --> 16:06.170
What's going on?

16:06.170 --> 16:07.580
Are you leaving?

16:07.580 --> 16:09.000
Um...

16:09.000 --> 16:10.250
You better believe
she's leaving.

16:10.250 --> 16:11.710
We thought she was
staying at your place.

16:11.710 --> 16:13.540
She never said anything
about a party.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.250
I'm just glad we put
that spyware on your phone.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.330
That's how we found you.

16:16.330 --> 16:18.250
Don't blame Andi.
I'm the one who brought--

16:18.250 --> 16:21.120
Nice try, Amber.
But Andi makes
her own decisions.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.580
She's gonna have to
face the consequences
for those decisions.

16:23.580 --> 16:25.380
I'm sorry.

16:25.380 --> 16:27.210
-It's okay.
-Let's go, young lady.

16:27.210 --> 16:29.460
Call your mother!
She's worried sick.

16:29.460 --> 16:31.710
(music continues)

16:37.120 --> 16:39.540
And the Oscar
goes to you.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.250
That was so believable.
I had no idea you could act.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.290
I meant it.

16:44.290 --> 16:45.290
All of what I just said.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.290
Wait. You're mad at me?

16:48.290 --> 16:51.210
No. I'm not mad
at you, exactly.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.880
I just don't want
to think of you
at parties like this

16:54.880 --> 16:55.960
and now I have to.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.710
But, I was responsible.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.960
I mean, I knew
I shouldn't be in there.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.210
And I texted you.

17:01.210 --> 17:05.420
You did. And you
should always,
always do that.

17:05.420 --> 17:08.080
But what you should
never do it be there
in the first place.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.790
I need to be able
to trust you.

17:11.790 --> 17:14.080
And right now,
at this moment, I don't.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.330
Did you hear that?

17:21.420 --> 17:23.250
I did.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.460
And I'm sorry.

17:26.120 --> 17:28.830
I won't do it again,
I promise.

17:28.830 --> 17:31.170
That was my dad
talking.

17:33.580 --> 17:35.170
I just turned into
my dad.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.250
Actually...

17:42.330 --> 17:45.290
I think you just
turned into my dad.

17:48.830 --> 17:52.500
♪ Don't ever put out ♪

17:52.500 --> 17:55.380
♪ The fire you bring ♪

17:55.380 --> 17:58.620
♪ The heavens still sing ♪

17:59.790 --> 18:02.790
-Call your mother.
-Oh. Okay, Dad.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.960
Nevermind.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.330
Here she is.

18:08.330 --> 18:09.620
-Where?
-There.

18:09.620 --> 18:10.710
What?

18:12.670 --> 18:14.040
Need a lift?

18:16.460 --> 18:19.710
What is with
the horse-drawn carriage?

18:21.960 --> 18:23.960
Wait.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.500
Were you two
on a date?

18:26.500 --> 18:28.920
Did I ruin your evening?
I feel horrible.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.500
A buggy ride?

18:32.500 --> 18:33.830
I have the cutest parents.

18:33.830 --> 18:35.380
(all giggling)

18:38.500 --> 18:42.250
Andi:
This is so much better
than a party in a warehouse.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.580
That's crazy.

18:51.670 --> 18:53.540
Hey. That never happened.

18:53.540 --> 18:54.830
It doesn't matter.

18:54.830 --> 18:56.210
We don't need to do this.

18:56.210 --> 18:57.580
Well, I don't want you
going around your whole life

18:57.580 --> 18:59.210
thinking I stole
your Little League jersey!

18:59.210 --> 19:00.500
But you did!

19:00.500 --> 19:01.670
I did not!

19:01.670 --> 19:03.420
What if I told you
that there was a way

19:03.420 --> 19:05.830
that we could
settle this debate,

19:05.830 --> 19:07.460
once and for all?

19:07.460 --> 19:08.750
How?

19:08.750 --> 19:10.540
Did you know
the Little League
organization

19:10.540 --> 19:13.040
you both played for
has a website?

19:13.040 --> 19:14.540
So?

19:14.540 --> 19:16.210
Well, on that website,

19:16.210 --> 19:19.210
are photos
of all the previous
Little League teams.

19:19.210 --> 19:20.710
Including yours.

19:26.580 --> 19:28.420
-I told you!
-I told you!

19:28.420 --> 19:29.380
It's 21.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.460
It is 21.

19:34.380 --> 19:35.420
Oh, no.

19:36.420 --> 19:38.210
Ah, man.
This is embarrassing.

19:40.460 --> 19:42.290
When I look
at this jersey,

19:42.290 --> 19:44.540
I see a 12.

19:44.540 --> 19:45.880
It's clearly 21.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.460
To you.

19:48.580 --> 19:49.790
To most people.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.250
But...

19:54.580 --> 19:57.330
I have a learning disability.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.460
It's a kind of dyslexia,
but with numbers
instead of words.

20:01.790 --> 20:03.620
Oh.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.750
I didn't know
I had it back then.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.920
I only found out
a few months ago.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.290
I'm sorry.

20:09.290 --> 20:10.620
What?

20:10.620 --> 20:12.250
No, I owe you
the apology.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.790
And I owe you one too.

20:14.790 --> 20:17.000
For holding on
to this stupid grudge
for so long.

20:18.420 --> 20:19.960
I never even
thanked you for

20:19.960 --> 20:21.750
helping me at Cyrus's
Bar Mitzvah party.

20:23.920 --> 20:26.830
That was the most scared
I've ever been in my life.

20:26.830 --> 20:28.170
Yeah. What was
going on then?

20:31.620 --> 20:32.710
Panic attack.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.460
I get those now.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.460
Everyone's got something
they got to deal with.

20:39.620 --> 20:40.830
Fear of flamingos.

20:42.460 --> 20:43.540
Both real and plastic.

20:49.460 --> 20:50.500
(knocking at door)

20:55.500 --> 20:56.500
Hey!

20:56.500 --> 20:57.620
Hey.

20:57.620 --> 20:59.960
So, how was the party?

20:59.960 --> 21:03.040
It was like being in
a crowded subway car,

21:03.040 --> 21:04.500
in a steam room,

21:04.500 --> 21:06.290
with speakers right here

21:06.290 --> 21:08.830
doing this all night:
(imitates bass)

21:08.830 --> 21:10.380
Sounds fun.

21:10.380 --> 21:11.880
It wasn't.

21:13.170 --> 21:15.000
This is fun.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.670
You are fun.

21:18.670 --> 21:20.000
I was hoping...

21:20.000 --> 21:23.580
that the DanceDance
Film Festival
was still happening.

21:23.580 --> 21:26.080
Oh, yeah. That'll be
going all night.

(giggles)

21:29.670 --> 21:31.500
(upbeat music playing)

21:38.250 --> 21:40.380
Do you think
we'll still be doing this
when we're 20?

21:40.380 --> 21:43.000
I hope. But that's like,
100 years from now.

Next on
Andi Mack...

22:08.710 --> 22:10.790
You know that Jefferson
has a secret society?

22:10.790 --> 22:12.580
One of you is going
to be invited to join.

22:12.580 --> 22:13.920
Which one?

22:13.920 --> 22:15.750
I don't know. I shouldn't
even be telling you this.

22:15.750 --> 22:17.460
But I wanted you
to be prepared.

22:17.460 --> 22:19.210
I knew this is what
would happen.

22:20.210 --> 22:21.880
Buffy!

22:21.880 --> 22:24.620
I just said, I wanna
buy a wedding dress.

22:24.620 --> 22:25.750
You should be melting.

22:25.750 --> 22:28.960
-Whoa.
-There's more.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.080
(sighs)

22:31.750 --> 22:33.620
Bex, this is the one.

22:33.620 --> 22:34.620
I wish Andi were here.

22:36.250 --> 22:37.460
Both: Andi!
