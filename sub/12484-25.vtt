00:06.760 --> 00:10.900
Chyna, up for a game
of tic-tac-toes?

00:10.930 --> 00:13.900
Gibson, I think it's
called tic-tac-toe.

00:13.940 --> 00:16.610
I don't think so.

00:20.740 --> 00:21.840
Your turn.

00:23.880 --> 00:26.580
I give up. You win.

00:26.620 --> 00:28.790
Yes! I always win
on the first move!

00:29.990 --> 00:31.590
Good morning!

00:31.620 --> 00:35.590
Olive, you're not allowed to
bring pets into the Ant Farm.

00:35.630 --> 00:37.830
Remember when Gibson brought his cat in?

00:43.670 --> 00:45.800
That's just how tigers show affection.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.770
By mauling children.

00:49.640 --> 00:51.840
Well, don't worry.
My pet is perfectly harmless.

00:52.810 --> 00:53.740
He's a Flurbot.

00:53.780 --> 00:56.710
<i>Hello!</i>

00:57.920 --> 01:01.920
He's been my loyal companion
since I was three.

01:01.950 --> 01:04.790
His name is Soren Aabye Kierkegaard,

01:04.819 --> 01:06.820
but that's kind of a mouthful,
so I call him by his nickname,

01:06.860 --> 01:08.960
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.

01:09.930 --> 01:10.990
Ooh, catchy.

01:11.030 --> 01:14.700
Much better than my
nickname when I was a kid.

01:14.730 --> 01:16.770
"Gibson."

01:16.800 --> 01:18.630
Kids can be so cruel.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.710
<i>Feed me! Feed me!</i>
<i>Feed me! Feed me!</i>

01:22.740 --> 01:25.610
When he's hungry, he won't
stop saying, "Feed me,"

01:25.640 --> 01:26.740
until you feed him.

01:34.650 --> 01:36.890
Hey, we have one of these
virtual pets at home.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.960
We use it to open cans.

01:38.990 --> 01:40.790
I think you're talking
about your can opener.

01:40.820 --> 01:41.690
You know, I think you're right.

01:42.990 --> 01:45.600
HEGE <i>Stupid!</i>

01:45.630 --> 01:47.800
Who you calling stupid?

01:47.830 --> 01:50.600
<i>Fletcher!</i>
<i>Fletcher stupid!</i>

01:51.840 --> 01:53.840
Why would he know how to say that?

01:53.870 --> 01:57.740
Uh, he might have overheard it at home.

02:53.760 --> 02:54.830
Peace, hepcat.

02:56.630 --> 02:56.730
How do I look?

02:57.940 --> 02:59.640
Groovy!

02:59.670 --> 03:00.840
Groovy means crazy, right?

03:01.940 --> 03:04.770
Wait, I need your help.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.610
This afternoon I'm meeting Dakota,

03:07.640 --> 03:08.880
the daughter of my boyfriend,

03:08.910 --> 03:11.680
dashing city councilman Ted Taggart,

03:11.720 --> 03:15.920
and I want her to think I'm out of sight.

03:15.950 --> 03:18.590
You might want to get out of sight

03:18.620 --> 03:20.860
because I think you're scaring people.

03:20.890 --> 03:24.560
Look, you're the most
popular girl in school

03:24.590 --> 03:26.900
and I need you to give me cool lessons.

03:26.930 --> 03:28.600
Why would I do that?

03:28.630 --> 03:29.770
Because if you don't,

03:29.800 --> 03:32.740
I'll stand here keep looking at me.

03:35.710 --> 03:38.640
Okay, okay, fine!
I'll do it!

03:47.990 --> 03:50.590
Gibson, what are you doing?

03:50.620 --> 03:53.620
Oh, I played Hegel in a game of
tic-tac-toes and I lost my shirt.

03:53.660 --> 03:55.620
I think he cheats.

03:55.660 --> 03:56.760
Hey, can one of you guys get my back?

04:00.960 --> 04:03.770
Where's my cute little boy?

04:03.800 --> 04:05.570
I'm right here!

04:05.600 --> 04:06.670
I was talking to Hegel.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.570
Oh.

04:11.780 --> 04:13.710
Who wants some belly rubbing?

04:13.740 --> 04:14.780
I do!

04:17.950 --> 04:20.680
Oh, him again.

04:22.790 --> 04:24.850
That's odd.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.620
Usually Hegel wakes right up
when I mention belly rubbing.

04:27.620 --> 04:29.660
Hegel? Hegel?

04:30.790 --> 04:31.860
He won't wake up!

04:31.900 --> 04:33.800
And I just put fresh batteries in!

04:33.830 --> 04:35.730
Look out!
Let me try mouth-to-mouth!

04:35.770 --> 04:36.870
Every second counts!

04:38.640 --> 04:39.770
But first.

04:44.880 --> 04:48.840
There is nothing dying people
hate more than chapped lips.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.780
Gibson.
He has no mouth.

04:51.850 --> 04:54.820
Oh, just like
my uncle Mmm-mmm.

04:59.860 --> 05:00.960
Don't you quit on me!

05:04.860 --> 05:08.500
Sorry, Olive, but I think Hegel's gone.

05:08.530 --> 05:10.630
No, he's not.
He's right there!

05:10.670 --> 05:11.800
He's dead, but he's right there.

05:12.740 --> 05:14.600
No!

05:20.540 --> 05:22.650
It should have been me.

05:22.680 --> 05:23.810
He had so much life to live.

05:26.820 --> 05:28.620
He was struck down in his prime!

05:31.760 --> 05:32.660
You shouldn't be alone tonight.

05:37.660 --> 05:39.700
Hey, this service is depressing.

05:39.730 --> 05:43.570
Let's put the fun
back in funeral! Chyna?

05:53.910 --> 05:56.610
This is a funeral!
Show some respect!

05:58.850 --> 06:01.580
I just want to hold Hegel one last time.

06:04.520 --> 06:05.020
Hold on.

06:05.060 --> 06:08.520
Look at his bottom.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.760
There are scratch marks from a
1/8" Phillips head screwdriver.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.630
Hegel didn't die of natural causes.

06:16.530 --> 06:16.830
He was murdered!

06:19.770 --> 06:20.600
Why would anyone do that?

06:22.810 --> 06:23.610
<i>Stupid!</i>

06:23.640 --> 06:25.910
<i>Who are you calling stupid?</i>

06:27.540 --> 06:29.750
<i>I think he cheats!</i>

06:30.850 --> 06:34.550
<i>Oh, him again!</i>

06:37.820 --> 06:41.520
What are you looking at me for?

06:41.560 --> 06:44.590
It wasn't me!
I didn't do it!

06:44.630 --> 06:45.790
The murderer always says,

06:45.830 --> 06:48.830
"It wasn't me!
I didn't do it!"

06:48.870 --> 06:52.600
Except in the rare case when they
say, "It was me! I did do it!"

06:52.640 --> 06:55.740
Or in the even rarer case when they
say, "It wasn't me, but I did do it!"

06:57.940 --> 07:00.640
Olive, that's the grief talking.

07:01.650 --> 07:02.910
Grief means crazy, right?

07:04.880 --> 07:07.550
I loved Hegel.

07:07.580 --> 07:11.650
And I'm going to find out which one
of you is responsible for his death.

07:11.690 --> 07:13.690
As soon as I find that screwdriver.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.520
Screwdriver?

07:16.440 --> 07:18.480
Looks like this case

07:20.610 --> 07:22.890
just got a little twisted.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.280
Screwdriver? Twisted?

07:28.440 --> 07:29.670
Nobody gets it? No?

07:53.770 --> 07:57.670
Thanks for volunteering to help me
after I only threatened you once.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.880
Usually, it takes two or three times

07:59.910 --> 08:02.810
and some sort of message,
like a finger in a box.

08:04.720 --> 08:08.820
No problem. It's my pleasure
to help you become more cool.

08:08.850 --> 08:11.890
So, um, should we start with my clothes?

08:11.920 --> 08:14.960
No, that's perfect.

08:14.990 --> 08:18.860
Ill-fitting tangerine polyester
pantsuits are very in right now.

08:20.770 --> 08:22.830
Then why don't you wear them?

08:22.870 --> 08:24.700
Because

08:24.740 --> 08:26.900
my mean parents won't buy them for me.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.970
They make me wear these ugly
expensive designer clothes instead.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.780
They are ugly.

08:35.750 --> 08:39.620
Okay, next you're going to
learn the cool new slang.

08:39.650 --> 08:41.850
Check this out.

08:41.890 --> 08:44.020
Disgusting haircut, you creepy little elf!

08:48.760 --> 08:50.990
He looks puzzled because I
don't usually compliment him.

08:51.030 --> 08:54.630
That was a compliment?

08:54.670 --> 08:58.000
Yeah. All the cool slang means the
opposite of what it sounds like it means.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.870
You know, how "sick"
means "awesome."

09:00.910 --> 09:03.010
I'm sure you've heard it all over school.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.610
No, I don't like you kids,

09:05.640 --> 09:07.840
and I work very hard on tuning you all out.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.720
Here's Gibson.
Pay him a compliment.

09:12.750 --> 09:13.950
Hey, donkey face.

09:13.990 --> 09:16.720
Wow, are you an idiot!

09:21.730 --> 09:23.860
Does crying mean laughing?

09:23.900 --> 09:25.730
You're catching on!

09:32.670 --> 09:34.840
Hey, what are you doing?

09:34.870 --> 09:36.710
Looking for the murder weapon.

09:36.740 --> 09:37.810
I'm conducting a search
of all your lockers.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.910
Luckily, I know your combinations.

09:40.950 --> 09:42.950
Slow down.
Got a warrant?

09:42.980 --> 09:45.920
No, but he does.

09:45.950 --> 09:48.720
This whole school is a crime scene.

09:51.860 --> 09:52.790
Wait.

09:52.820 --> 09:54.760
This says,
"Caution. Party zone."

09:57.900 --> 10:02.800
Shouldn't it say,
"Police line. Do not cross"?

10:02.830 --> 10:05.000
That's why nobody came
to Cameron's birthday party.

10:06.870 --> 10:07.740
That's not why no one came.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.810
And Dad, don't you have
anything better to do

10:12.840 --> 10:16.010
than investigate the death of a Flurbot?

10:16.050 --> 10:18.820
Nope. The police force
solved every crime.

10:18.850 --> 10:20.680
But on the bright side,

10:20.720 --> 10:23.050
the police sketch artist has
more time to do caricatures.

10:26.790 --> 10:27.960
Search all you want.

10:27.990 --> 10:29.830
You're not going to find anything.

10:31.860 --> 10:33.830
What the heck?

10:33.870 --> 10:35.670
It's a rotisserie spit.

10:35.700 --> 10:40.000
You cannot get properly
cooked shawarma in this town.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.840
Oh, okay. Move along.
Nothing to see here.

10:42.870 --> 10:44.740
Nothing to see here?

10:44.780 --> 10:47.010
Angus has a Middle Eastern
restaurant in his locker!

10:48.050 --> 10:51.680
Got to go.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.980
The guys at the station are giving
the police dog a lie detector test.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.920
Maybe the chief will finally believe

10:55.950 --> 10:57.790
I'm not the one that ate his shoes.

10:59.990 --> 11:01.930
Okay.
Look, Olive,

11:01.960 --> 11:03.730
I know that you're grief-stricken
over the loss of your

11:03.760 --> 11:06.760
$4 toy,

11:06.800 --> 11:10.800
but there is no evidence here
that anyone killed Hegel.

11:14.810 --> 11:16.810
A Flurbot manual?

11:16.840 --> 11:19.010
A 1/8" Phillips head screwdriver!

11:19.040 --> 11:19.080
You killed Hegel!

11:21.910 --> 11:22.910
What?

11:22.950 --> 11:23.910
How could you, Chyna?

11:23.950 --> 11:25.950
I thought you were my best friend.

11:29.750 --> 11:30.720
But I am your best friend!

11:30.760 --> 11:33.960
It wasn't me!
I didn't do it!

11:33.990 --> 11:35.830
Looks like it's not just the shawarma

11:38.060 --> 11:40.730
that's feeling the heat.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.740
Give me back my sunglasses!

11:48.970 --> 11:51.940
Lexi, I see you got my gift!

11:51.980 --> 11:55.750
Thank you so much for buying
me this super trendy outfit.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.780
Where did you get it?
Forever 81?

12:01.090 --> 12:04.620
Anyway, the best way to make
a cool first impression

12:04.660 --> 12:07.820
with Ted Taggart's daughter is
with a supercool handshake.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.830
Okay.
Follow my lead.

12:19.800 --> 12:20.770
Ow!

12:22.810 --> 12:23.810
What? What are
you doing?

12:23.840 --> 12:25.940
That was the end of the handshake.

12:35.820 --> 12:36.820
Hey, Olive!

12:36.850 --> 12:40.690
Oh, sorry, my parents always told me,

12:40.730 --> 12:41.830
"Olive, never talk
to criminals."

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
My parents gave me similar advi.

12:46.030 --> 12:48.830
They said, "Gibson, never
buy seafood from a clown."

12:51.800 --> 12:53.770
I think she's still angry at you.

12:53.810 --> 12:57.770
My mom?
It was one bucket of crawfish!

12:57.810 --> 12:58.940
Okay, what do you want?

12:58.980 --> 13:01.910
Nothing. I just really
like to stand in line.

13:03.780 --> 13:04.880
Admit it, Chyna!

13:04.920 --> 13:07.680
You used that screwdriver
to mangle Hegel's insides!

13:07.720 --> 13:11.790
I'll have the shawarma plate
with extra rice, please.

13:11.820 --> 13:13.860
You were jealous of
my relationship with him!

13:13.890 --> 13:15.930
What?
I wasn't jealous.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.760
I even fed him for you.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.660
I'm telling you I was framed!

13:19.700 --> 13:21.930
And I'll prove it!
I will not rest...

13:21.970 --> 13:23.900
I'll take a shawarma sandwich
with a little extra hummus.

13:23.940 --> 13:26.770
Until I find the real culprit!

13:26.800 --> 13:28.000
How are you going to do that?

13:28.040 --> 13:30.770
Well, I found a strand
of the criminal's hair

13:30.810 --> 13:33.680
stuck in the screwdriver and my
dad's gonna run a match on it.

13:33.710 --> 13:34.850
I just need hair samples from everyone.

13:35.810 --> 13:36.750
Ow!

13:37.010 --> 13:38.050
Ow!

13:39.050 --> 13:41.720
Oh! Ah!

13:41.750 --> 13:44.020
My hair is very strong.

13:44.060 --> 13:47.000
The military buys it to make rope.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.530
Okay, Dad, so I put all the
evidence right here in my...

14:15.860 --> 14:16.760
What happened to my hair?

14:16.800 --> 14:19.870
It doesn't look that bad.
Just wear a hat.

14:21.870 --> 14:23.570
Well, not my hair.

14:24.810 --> 14:26.870
I was talking about the hair samples.

14:26.910 --> 14:30.740
Hegel's killer must have stolen them.

14:30.780 --> 14:33.580
Now what? Olive will never
be my friend again.

14:33.780 --> 14:35.720
Relax.

14:35.750 --> 14:39.690
I'm a highly decorated member of the
San Francisco Police Department.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.890
Let's just go over the facts again.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.790
Okay.

14:43.820 --> 14:45.890
Olive's Flurbot stopped working.

14:45.930 --> 14:47.890
There were scratch marks on its back

14:47.930 --> 14:50.900
that match the 1/8th Phillips
screwdriver that was in my locker.

14:53.830 --> 14:54.940
Looks like you did it.

14:56.700 --> 14:57.870
What?
Don't worry.

14:57.910 --> 14:58.910
I won't tell anyone.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.570
My lips are sealed.

15:00.610 --> 15:01.680
And a little chapped.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.880
Mmm.

15:07.850 --> 15:09.550
Chapped!

15:10.720 --> 15:12.820
That's it!
I know who did it!

15:12.850 --> 15:15.690
And that's

15:16.890 --> 15:18.690
not just lip service.

15:22.830 --> 15:24.600
Angus got shawarma grease
all over my glasses.

15:28.770 --> 15:30.670
Well, I've taught you everything I know.

15:30.710 --> 15:34.710
Ted Taggart's daughter is going to think
you are the world's biggest idiot.

15:36.580 --> 15:39.580
I certainly hope so.

15:39.610 --> 15:40.650
That looks like Ted Taggart's daughter.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.550
That's Olive.

15:43.580 --> 15:46.890
Wow. I've done a really good
job of tuning you kids out.

15:46.920 --> 15:46.950
Excuse me,

15:49.860 --> 15:52.590
I'm looking for Principal Skidmore.

15:52.630 --> 15:53.730
Oh, that's me.

15:54.630 --> 15:56.760
Oh, hi!

15:56.800 --> 16:00.670
I'm Ted Taggart's
daughter. Dakota.

16:00.700 --> 16:02.940
You're Dakota?
How old are you?

16:02.970 --> 16:05.570
Twenty-five.

16:06.740 --> 16:08.780
You look a lot older than 25.

16:08.810 --> 16:13.680
I'm sorry, my hearing's not very good.

16:13.710 --> 16:16.550
I thought you asked me
what year I was born.

16:16.580 --> 16:18.620
1925.

16:20.860 --> 16:23.760
You're older than I am!

16:23.790 --> 16:25.530
Wait a second.

16:25.560 --> 16:26.730
How old is your father?

16:27.760 --> 16:29.700
I don't know.

16:29.730 --> 16:31.830
They didn't really keep records back then.

16:36.640 --> 16:39.910
I think you all know why
I've gathered you here.

16:39.940 --> 16:41.740
Are we having a pot luck?

16:41.780 --> 16:43.880
Because I brought clown lobster!

16:46.550 --> 16:50.750
You're here because I know
who the real culprit is!

16:50.790 --> 16:53.620
And Olive, you'll see, once and for all,

16:53.650 --> 16:55.860
that I would never hurt you.

16:55.890 --> 16:59.560
I was set up, made to
look like the fall guy,

16:59.590 --> 17:02.600
the straw man, the patsy.

17:06.630 --> 17:07.670
Why are you laughing?

17:07.700 --> 17:09.500
Patsy is what I used to call my pacifier,

17:09.540 --> 17:11.640
which reminds me...

17:14.740 --> 17:15.880
Proceed.

17:20.510 --> 17:26.490
As with all crimes, it always
comes down to one thing.

17:26.520 --> 17:30.790
Who had the opportunity
and who had the motive?

17:32.790 --> 17:34.690
Okay, okay, so it comes down to two things.

17:35.860 --> 17:41.630
Anyway, only one person here had the motive

17:41.670 --> 17:42.500
and...
Okay!

17:42.540 --> 17:44.870
Fine! It was me!
I did it!

17:44.910 --> 17:48.640
It called me stupid!
And nobody calls me stupid!

17:48.680 --> 17:49.840
Well, actually, I call you stupid.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.580
Okay, you all call me stupid,

17:51.610 --> 17:53.810
but from Hegel it really stung.

17:55.680 --> 17:56.680
Chyna, I am so sorry I blamed you.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.690
Hold on.
It wasn't him.

17:59.720 --> 18:03.590
Because he left out one important fact.

18:03.820 --> 18:05.630
He

18:05.660 --> 18:06.460
is not Fletcher!

18:10.560 --> 18:12.470
Fine! I did it!

18:15.700 --> 18:18.440
I was jealous of that Flurbot
getting all of your affection

18:18.470 --> 18:20.470
instead of me!

18:20.510 --> 18:22.580
<i>That's why I opened him up</i>
<i>and removed his logic board!</i>

18:26.810 --> 18:29.680
<i>But I had to</i>
<i>cover my tracks.</i>

18:29.720 --> 18:31.650
<i>So, dressed as Fletcher</i>
<i>wearing a glove on his head,</i>

18:31.690 --> 18:35.460
<i>I planted the evidence</i>
<i>in Chyna's locker.</i>

18:35.720 --> 18:38.630
<i>Then when Chyna</i>
<i>took the hair samples,</i>

18:38.660 --> 18:41.460
<i>I stole them</i> <i>dressed as
Fletcher</i> <i>dressed as Wacky</i>

18:41.500 --> 18:43.560
<i>to make it look like</i> <i>Fletcher tried
to frame</i> <i>Wacky for framing Chyna.</i>

18:46.700 --> 18:49.470
And I'd do it again,

18:49.500 --> 18:53.540
but I can't, 'cause I'm kind of
confused about exactly what I did.

18:56.810 --> 18:57.810
Case closed.
No.

18:57.850 --> 19:00.650
Case still open.

19:00.680 --> 19:04.520
Because Angus is not the murderer!

19:04.550 --> 19:06.750
When Angus cut Hegel's wires,

19:06.790 --> 19:07.720
Hegel was already dead!

19:10.690 --> 19:12.660
He had been snuffed out just minutes before

19:13.590 --> 19:14.630
by...

19:14.660 --> 19:17.630
Okay, fine!
It was me! I did it!

19:17.670 --> 19:20.400
It called me stupid!

19:20.430 --> 19:22.570
And nobo calls me stupid!

19:22.600 --> 19:23.340
Actually, I call you stupid.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.610
Okay, you all call me stupid,

19:25.640 --> 19:27.710
but from Hegel it really stung.

19:27.740 --> 19:30.540
That's what I said!

19:30.580 --> 19:32.510
By the way, my Fletcher voice
is way better than yours.

19:34.750 --> 19:36.480
I couldn't take the abuse anymore.

19:37.690 --> 19:38.520
<i>So I poisoned him!</i>

19:44.790 --> 19:46.530
So it was Fletcher!

19:46.560 --> 19:48.490
Case closed.
And it's open again.

19:51.430 --> 19:52.570
Because what Fletcher didn't know

19:52.600 --> 19:53.500
is that when he poisoned Hegel,

19:55.470 --> 19:55.870
Hegel was already dead!

19:57.740 --> 20:00.540
He had been killed just minutes before,

20:01.710 --> 20:02.510
by

20:03.640 --> 20:04.780
Gibson!

20:06.780 --> 20:10.720
CHYN <i>28 games of</i>
<i>tic-tac-toe in a row,</i>

20:10.750 --> 20:11.650
<i>Hegel had beaten Gibson,</i>

20:11.690 --> 20:14.650
<i>who, it's become</i>
<i>increasingly clear,</i>

20:14.690 --> 20:17.720
<i>has no understanding</i>
<i>of what tic-tac-toe is.</i>

20:17.760 --> 20:20.630
<i>Humiliated, Gibson</i>
<i>flipped over the table,</i>

20:20.660 --> 20:23.730
<i>sending Hegel</i> <i>flying through
the air</i> <i>to his death.</i>

20:23.760 --> 20:25.700
<i>Gibson didn't</i>
<i>mean to kill him,</i>

20:25.730 --> 20:28.530
<i>as evidenced by</i> <i>the lip balm
residue</i> <i>on Hegel's face</i>

20:28.570 --> 20:31.670
<i>from where Gibson</i> <i>futilely tried to
administer</i> <i>mouth-to-mouth resuscitation</i>

20:31.710 --> 20:33.840
<i>to a toy with no mouth.</i>

20:36.740 --> 20:39.780
It's true!
It was an accident!

20:39.810 --> 20:43.480
But he kept mocking me with this mocking,

20:43.520 --> 20:47.450
mocking sound of mocking!

20:47.490 --> 20:50.560
I'm now going to mock the mocking
sound he made to mock me.

20:58.570 --> 21:00.530
Wait! That's not
a mocking sound.

21:00.570 --> 21:02.740
That's the sound he makes
when he's been overfed.

21:02.770 --> 21:04.670
He must've eaten a fatal amount of food

21:04.710 --> 21:06.640
and died in midair before he landed.

21:06.670 --> 21:08.640
So Gibson didn't kill Hegel.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.610
Whoever overfed him did!

21:10.640 --> 21:11.580
Who was the last one to feed him?

21:16.820 --> 21:17.520
<i>You're still hungry?</i>

21:19.550 --> 21:21.750
<i>Okay, Hegelly Weggelly!</i>

21:28.530 --> 21:30.500
Chyna fed him last.

21:33.530 --> 21:37.980
Except, I'm not Chyna!

21:39.940 --> 21:41.300
I'm...

21:48.420 --> 21:50.790
I cannot seem to get this mask off.

21:51.910 --> 21:54.140
Well I just have to...

22:00.900 --> 22:02.610
I din't mean to hurt Hegel.

22:02.610 --> 22:04.610
Sorry. I thought I was helping.

22:05.930 --> 22:08.320
I accept your apology.

22:08.320 --> 22:12.280
To quote Hegel's favorite philosoper. Hegel.

22:19.150 --> 22:21.170
Ok, what was that mean?

22:21.410 --> 22:24.430
To paraphase. Whatevs!

22:26.700 --> 22:28.500
Eh, if it helps.

22:28.500 --> 22:31.020
I'm sure Hagel loves you as much as you love him.

22:36.030 --> 22:39.660
Eh. She fell for it.

22:40.370 --> 22:48.770
No more Olive, I'm free. Free. Free.
