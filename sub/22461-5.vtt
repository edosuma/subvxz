00:19.520 --> 00:21.299
'Don't even think about Dobby.

00:21.323 --> 00:23.742
'If I don't look at Dobby,
I can't be in love with her.

Lovely, calming beating.'

00:28.267 --> 00:30.746
'Tilt and squeeze. Don't be a hero.'

00:30.747 --> 00:34.426
Mark, you do realise you've been
opening that for almost 15 minutes?

00:34.427 --> 00:37.266
Just because I'm very carefully
easing open the cava

00:37.328 --> 00:38.827
doesn't mean I'm not celebrating.

00:38.870 --> 00:40.989
It's not how Formula One
drivers do it, is it?

00:40.990 --> 00:43.229
If those drivers bought
the champagne themselves

00:43.230 --> 00:45.989
and were responsible for cleaning up
the podium afterwards,

00:45.990 --> 00:47.829
I suspect this is
very much how they'd do it.

00:47.830 --> 00:50.269
'Anyway, I've only been promoted
to travelling salesman,

00:50.270 --> 00:52.029
'I haven't won the Japanese Grand Prix,

00:52.030 --> 00:53.949
'although that's probably
a damn sight easier

00:53.950 --> 00:55.390
than getting Dobby to move in here.'

00:56.395 --> 00:57.514
Er, are you OK?

00:57.515 --> 00:59.914
Shit. That was a bad one.

00:59.915 --> 01:02.714
I think it's the damp in your wall.

01:02.715 --> 01:06.514
Uh-huh. Nothing to do with the bongs
you and Jeremy are always smoking?

01:06.515 --> 01:08.434
What are you, the cannabis police?

01:08.435 --> 01:11.754
Well, no, that would come under
the remit of the actual police.

01:11.755 --> 01:14.954
Seriously, I don't think I can move
in till you get the damp sorted out.

01:14.955 --> 01:17.154
Now I don't need
to get out of playing hockey,

01:17.155 --> 01:19.074
asthma attacks are really no use to me.

01:19.075 --> 01:22.234
Of course. Of course,
I understand completely.

01:22.235 --> 01:24.914
'Could she be faking asthma
to avoid moving in with me?

01:24.915 --> 01:26.834
'There's only one way to find out,

01:26.835 --> 01:29.354
'aside from a series
of rigorous medical tests.'

01:29.355 --> 01:31.754
Tell you what, I'll call
the freehold committee,

01:31.755 --> 01:33.074
ask them to pay for the repairs.

01:33.075 --> 01:35.034
Oh, contacting a committee for me!

01:35.035 --> 01:36.474
That's so romantic.

01:36.475 --> 01:38.154
I'd e-mail a thousand councils

01:38.155 --> 01:40.834
and petition a million
quangos for you, Dobby.

01:40.835 --> 01:43.274
That's probably the plot
of the next Twilight film.

01:43.275 --> 01:47.274
And once the damp patch is sorted,
it's, "Bonjour, chez Dobby."

01:47.435 --> 01:49.034
Has Jeremy found a place, then?

01:49.035 --> 01:50.074
Er...

01:50.075 --> 01:51.634
Well, he will do. Very soon.

01:51.635 --> 01:53.994
He's started clearing out his
stuff tonight, actually.

01:53.995 --> 01:56.074
He's playing Street Fighter II
with your nephew.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.474
Well, he was clearing it
out, until he found that thing.

01:58.475 --> 02:00.714
But he really means it this time.

02:00.715 --> 02:03.794
He's already thrown out his collection
of limited-edition Tango cans.

02:03.795 --> 02:06.634
'And from the way he cried
over every can,

02:06.635 --> 02:10.633
'shifting him is going to be
fucking murder.'

02:10.914 --> 02:12.634
- Would you care to...?
- Where's Dobby?

02:12.635 --> 02:13.674
Gone.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.474
'Thank God. As you were, eyes. You
can look away from the TV again.'

02:16.475 --> 02:18.474
- What's this for?
- To toast my promotion.

02:18.475 --> 02:22.194
Say hello to the new travelling sales
rep for Baths, Bathrooms & Fittings!

02:22.195 --> 02:24.754
How can you be a travelling sales
rep? You can't drive.

02:24.755 --> 02:26.834
You can get places without
cars, you know.

02:26.835 --> 02:30.514
This nation was made great by its
network of railway and canals.

02:30.515 --> 02:33.914
Oh, I see, you're going to go
by barge. That's a good idea.

02:33.915 --> 02:37.314
Well, no, it'll mostly be buses
and trains. I'll be fine.

02:37.315 --> 02:41.114
They've given me a sat nav. And to
Dobby moving in this weekend.

02:41.115 --> 02:42.834
This weekend?

02:42.835 --> 02:45.954
The wheels are in motion,
the lorry of fate is...

02:45.955 --> 02:47.634
driving into you, Jez. I'm sorry.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.994
So this is... an ultimatum.

02:49.995 --> 02:52.874
Of course not! It's much more
friendly than that. If anything,

02:52.875 --> 02:54.314
it's an ulti-matey.

02:57.235 --> 02:58.434
Hi, Jeremy.

02:58.435 --> 02:59.874
Oh, hi. What's up?

02:59.875 --> 03:01.994
Have you been crying?
It's not my fault, is it?

03:01.995 --> 03:03.194
Nick and I broke up.

03:03.195 --> 03:05.154
'OK, I have no idea who Nick is.'

03:05.155 --> 03:08.114
Oh, shit. Come here.

03:08.115 --> 03:10.114
'You feel bad, so I feel
you. Classic.'

03:10.115 --> 03:12.714
I decided it was time to tell him
I had a son cos he was saying

03:12.715 --> 03:14.354
he likes his niece -
he's got a niece...

03:14.355 --> 03:16.834
and then he just went all quiet
and said really calmly,

03:16.835 --> 03:19.434
"Well, Sarah, I'm afraid
in that case I'm out,"

03:19.435 --> 03:21.834
like he was fucking Duncan Bannatyne.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.674
Tch! Do you want some cava?

03:24.675 --> 03:27.074
Yes, please, Jeremy.
Thanks for being so sweet.

03:27.075 --> 03:28.514
'Of course,

03:28.515 --> 03:30.954
'Mark's sister.
She's got nice, sad eyes

03:30.955 --> 03:32.914
'and is all vulnerable and huggy.

03:32.915 --> 03:34.874
'Forget Dobby. Dobby's gone.

03:34.875 --> 03:36.674
'Sarah's here now.

03:36.675 --> 03:39.914
'I mean, I shouldn't just take the first
thing that comes along, unless...

03:39.915 --> 03:42.314
'maybe it's fate. Good old fate.

03:42.315 --> 03:45.394
'It does the hard work
so you don't have to.

03:45.395 --> 03:47.194
'Or am I thinking of Flash?'

03:47.195 --> 03:48.554
Very damp.

03:48.555 --> 03:50.594
Yes, it's sodden.

03:50.595 --> 03:51.954
Sodden.

03:51.955 --> 03:53.634
It just means "very damp".

03:53.635 --> 03:54.674
Yes.

03:54.675 --> 03:57.394
Well, I'll need to show the committee
as soon as possible.

03:57.395 --> 04:00.754
Er, sorry, one second, Ben.
What is it?

04:00.755 --> 04:03.114
Great news, Mark.
I've found a new place to live.

04:03.115 --> 04:05.034
Oh! Fantastic.

04:05.035 --> 04:09.034
That's so quick. How did you manage
to find somewhere so...

04:09.235 --> 04:13.034
Oh, right.

04:13.035 --> 04:14.874
So, is this table going, then?

04:14.875 --> 04:16.754
Er, no, that's Mark's as well.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.914
Right. So, what actually
is yours, then? It's not just

04:19.915 --> 04:23.274
these bags of clothes, the case of
porn and the MiniDisc player, is it?

04:23.275 --> 04:24.954
Oh, no, I mean, there's more.

04:24.955 --> 04:26.994
There'd better be.
I blagged a lorry, mate.

04:26.995 --> 04:28.754
So, where are all your MiniDiscs?

04:28.755 --> 04:31.594
Well, I put all my vinyl on
MiniDisc in the Noughties

04:31.595 --> 04:35.194
and then... threw away the
MiniDiscs in the Teenies.

04:35.195 --> 04:38.874
'How can that be all my stuff?
Why is everything Mark's?'

04:38.875 --> 04:40.154
Jez, mate, what else is there?

04:40.155 --> 04:41.394
These chairs are mine.

04:41.395 --> 04:45.394
'Fuck you, Mark. If you're going to hump
Dobby, I'm going to hump your chairs.'

04:47.675 --> 04:50.394
'This is appalling.
Three trains, four buses

04:50.395 --> 04:54.194
'and a cab, anywhere between two and
five hours, depending on waiting times.

04:54.195 --> 04:56.794
'How is it this complicated
to go to an industrial estate

04:56.795 --> 04:59.954
'in Lutterworth? I feel like I'm
trying to get to fucking Mordor.'

04:59.955 --> 05:01.674
'In 100 yards, turn left.'

05:01.675 --> 05:03.554
Oh, God, no. Shut up!

05:03.555 --> 05:05.274
'Turn left.'

05:05.275 --> 05:06.554
'Turn around where possible.'

05:06.555 --> 05:07.914
I don't know how to turn it down!

05:07.915 --> 05:11.914
'Make a U-turn. Make a U-turn.'

05:12.235 --> 05:16.074
And I'm here, the Emerald City,
only 24 minutes late.

05:16.075 --> 05:17.274
Mark Corrigan?

05:17.275 --> 05:18.954
Er, yes. Er, hi.

05:18.955 --> 05:20.034
Alan McGurnagee.

05:20.035 --> 05:21.194
So, I said to your guys

05:21.195 --> 05:23.034
I'm not looking for new models
at the moment,

05:23.035 --> 05:25.594
but they said they'd send you
just in case, so...

05:25.595 --> 05:26.714
what is it you've got?

05:26.715 --> 05:28.714
Er...

05:28.715 --> 05:30.234
Right.

05:30.235 --> 05:32.954
Yes.

05:32.955 --> 05:35.954
That towel rail is particularly sturdy.

05:35.955 --> 05:38.434
Not for me, thanks, Mark.
Cheers for coming.

05:38.435 --> 05:39.794
Hope the drive wasn't too bad.

05:39.795 --> 05:43.794
'Three trains, four buses
and a big "fuck you".'

05:43.955 --> 05:46.594
T-shirt on a coat hanger.
I am living the dream.

05:46.595 --> 05:47.834
Jeremy?

05:47.835 --> 05:49.234
Hey, honey, you're home!

05:49.235 --> 05:51.914
'This is so great. She'll probably
want sex right now.

05:51.915 --> 05:54.794
'That'll be how I'm paying rent.
I'm an actual rent boy.

05:54.795 --> 05:56.354
'Why didn't I do this before?

05:56.355 --> 05:59.034
Listen, I've got a bit of work to
do, so can you make dinner...

05:59.035 --> 06:01.034
not pasta -
and then play chess with Joshy?

06:01.035 --> 06:02.794
- Yes. Great.
- Do you know chess?

06:02.795 --> 06:04.234
I know of it.

06:04.235 --> 06:05.874
It's squares, isn't it?

06:05.875 --> 06:07.114
Google it.

06:07.115 --> 06:08.794
Cool. Will do. Great.

06:08.795 --> 06:12.674
'OK, that's fine, the sex comes
later. I'm still bossing this.

06:12.675 --> 06:15.874
'I get to just learn chess
and practise cooking for free!

06:15.875 --> 06:19.874
'I'm exploiting the shit
out of her, the poor fool.'

06:20.595 --> 06:22.794
Sorry I'm late. A million apologies.

06:22.795 --> 06:25.834
'Old Mother Hubbard
and Captain Cardigan.

06:25.835 --> 06:29.194
'Is this the freehold committee?
This'll be a breeze!'

06:29.195 --> 06:30.314
I'll let us in.

06:30.315 --> 06:32.834
'Operation New Wall starts now.

06:32.835 --> 06:35.114
'Oh, hang on. Brilliant... Gail.

06:35.115 --> 06:37.434
'The only person who hates
me more than my father.

06:37.435 --> 06:39.754
'This isn't a breeze,
it's a mega-shitstorm.'

06:39.755 --> 06:40.994
Take a, um...

06:40.995 --> 06:43.794
'And my chairs have all gone.
Perfect.'

06:43.795 --> 06:45.434
Where are the chairs?

06:45.435 --> 06:47.434
Er, take the sofa. I'll stand.

06:47.435 --> 06:49.314
'Hm, this might be OK.

06:49.315 --> 06:50.514
'I feel tall, dominant,

06:50.515 --> 06:51.754
like a mighty oak.'

06:51.755 --> 06:52.914
This won't take long.

06:52.915 --> 06:55.874
You can't have new walls, Mark. That's
not what the sinking fund is for.

06:55.875 --> 06:59.154
Yes, well, thanks for that, Gail, but I
did actually only ask Ben to look at it,

06:59.155 --> 07:01.434
so I don't even know why you're here.

07:01.435 --> 07:04.674
- Have you got any biscuits?
- What? No.

07:04.675 --> 07:08.674
OK, look, Ben, the wall needs
to go. It's as wet as a...

07:08.835 --> 07:10.434
'What's the phrase for wet things?

07:10.435 --> 07:12.834
'Not "eagle".
That doesn't work.

07:12.835 --> 07:14.954
'I must be able to think of a
single object

07:14.955 --> 07:16.634
'other than an eagle. Please!'

07:16.635 --> 07:17.714
eagle.

07:17.715 --> 07:19.434
"As wet as an eagle"?

07:19.435 --> 07:21.954
It really is.

07:21.955 --> 07:23.154
I've got asthma.

07:23.155 --> 07:26.834
I actually find it really difficult to
sleep here sometimes because of it.

07:26.835 --> 07:28.834
Well, break up with him, then.

07:28.835 --> 07:31.154
Look, Ben, I need to dip
into the sinking fund.

07:31.155 --> 07:32.274
No, absolutely not.

07:32.275 --> 07:35.034
We can't do anything, Mark, till the
new chairman's been elected.

07:35.035 --> 07:36.314
Are you not the chairman?

07:36.315 --> 07:37.674
Ben stood down last month.

07:37.675 --> 07:39.834
So who's in charge now?

07:39.835 --> 07:41.914
We're actually looking
for a new chairperson,

07:41.915 --> 07:43.674
if you were interested in running...?

07:43.675 --> 07:46.354
Oh, well, not sure, really.

07:46.355 --> 07:49.394
'Darn fucking tootin' I'm going
to run! And I'm going to win.

07:49.395 --> 07:51.394
'Dobby'll love that.
Women love power.

07:51.395 --> 07:52.834
'Just look at Clinton.

07:52.835 --> 07:56.234
'I'll be like
a very faithful Clinton.'

07:56.235 --> 08:00.234
'God, two toilet stops and
mind-melting kiddy music.

08:00.275 --> 08:02.514
'Why couldn't he have just left
Joshy home alone?

08:02.515 --> 08:04.834
'According to the films, he'd have
been absolutely fine.'

08:04.835 --> 08:08.834
I appreciate the lift, but it really
is insufficient payment for my chairs.

08:08.915 --> 08:10.794
You stole my chairs.
You have to return them.

08:11.835 --> 08:14.594
And find yourself somewhere proper to
live, while you're at it.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.914
What's that supposed to mean?

08:15.915 --> 08:18.354
Stop leeching off my sister
while she's such a wreck.

08:18.355 --> 08:20.394
I'm not a leech, Mark. And if I am,

08:20.395 --> 08:22.954
I'm one of the good ones that
cured diseases in the olden days.

08:22.955 --> 08:25.314
Leeches never cured
anyone of anything, Jeremy.

08:25.315 --> 08:27.994
Well, what do you expect?
They're leeches, not bloody doctors.

08:27.995 --> 08:30.394
You don't have to live with
a Corrigan, you realise.

08:30.395 --> 08:32.474
You don't only survive
on Corrigan blood.

08:34.275 --> 08:37.234
God! That'll be Mad Andy. He's figured
out he's got abandonment issues.

08:37.235 --> 08:39.274
Well, are you going to take it?

08:39.275 --> 08:40.114
Nah.

08:41.315 --> 08:44.514
Hey, there's loads about sales and
shit in life coaching, you know, Mark.

08:44.515 --> 08:47.594
The key thing is to not accept
negativity.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.914
So it's like I don't hear
the word "no" any more,

08:49.915 --> 08:51.754
I hear, "Convince me."

08:51.755 --> 08:55.074
Well, if that's true, Jeremy, you'll
end up in prison for sexual assault.

08:55.075 --> 08:58.394
Or you just say celebrities are doing
it, whatever it is. That always works.

08:58.395 --> 09:00.274
'Since Johnny Rotten started doing
Country Life,

09:00.275 --> 09:03.634
'I've been buttering
like a bastard.'

09:03.635 --> 09:04.954
'Buy it.

09:04.955 --> 09:07.194
'Please buy it. It's a tap. You
sell taps.

09:07.195 --> 09:08.434
'Please, please buy it.'

09:08.435 --> 09:09.914
Don't like this one.

09:09.915 --> 09:11.154
Right. So, um...

09:11.155 --> 09:12.594
interestingly...

09:12.595 --> 09:14.714
'Come on, think of a
celebrity... Um...

09:14.715 --> 09:16.274
'Not the Queen. That's too obvious.'

09:16.275 --> 09:17.714
Jools Holland has got that one.

09:17.715 --> 09:19.394
I think it's a no. Thank you.

09:19.395 --> 09:21.314
Right. No probs.

09:21.315 --> 09:22.354
Oh, cool!

09:22.355 --> 09:23.794
What are these? Are they for sale?

09:23.795 --> 09:24.914
'Oh, no, what's he doing?'

09:24.915 --> 09:28.354
I'm looking for some taps for my new
bathroom, and I love these.

09:28.355 --> 09:29.874
They're not actually for sale.

09:29.875 --> 09:33.234
Oh. That's a real shame,
cos I like them... a lot,

09:33.235 --> 09:35.154
as would all of my friends
and colleagues.

09:35.155 --> 09:36.954
I think Mark Ronson
has ones like these.

09:36.955 --> 09:38.234
Really? I didn't know that.

09:38.235 --> 09:40.554
'Mark Ronson?
Of course, he's cool.

09:40.555 --> 09:41.794
'Say someone else cool.'

09:41.795 --> 09:44.194
And... Werner Herzog's
got them as well.

09:44.195 --> 09:46.354
They're amazing. I want them.

09:46.355 --> 09:49.114
I mean, we do have a lot of taps
that look like these ones.

09:49.115 --> 09:51.394
No, no, no, it has to be these
ones. These exact ones.

09:51.395 --> 09:52.474
Can I buy them?

09:52.475 --> 09:54.634
Um, yes. Just give me two minutes.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.354
Mark, do you want to follow me?

09:56.355 --> 09:59.514
'I am such a good friend.
And person.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.834
'But I still get the glare!

10:00.835 --> 10:04.834
'I'd probably still get the glare
if I gave him one of my kidneys.'

10:06.435 --> 10:06.954
Well?

10:06.955 --> 10:08.394
Well?
I sold 300 units.

10:08.395 --> 10:09.114
Amazing!

10:09.115 --> 10:10.514
But fraudulently.

10:10.515 --> 10:13.834
I'm basically the Bernie
Madoff of bathroom retail.

10:13.835 --> 10:16.474
I think I'm going
to puke pure adrenaline.

10:16.475 --> 10:18.034
Is he the guy that rides the ostrich?

10:18.035 --> 10:19.794
No, that's Bernie Clifton.
Madoff is...

10:19.795 --> 10:23.514
Well, if you replace the ostrich
with the NASDAQ share index,

10:23.515 --> 10:26.194
you're basically there.
He's a dirty crook! As am I.

10:26.195 --> 10:27.554
"Thanks" would have been nice.

10:27.555 --> 10:30.354
'Right, yes, "Thank you for making me
commit fraud."

10:30.355 --> 10:32.874
'Oddly, I haven't seen that
card in WH Smith's.'

10:34.155 --> 10:35.434
'Oh, please. Oh, God, no.'

10:37.075 --> 10:38.554
Well, keep pushing!

10:38.555 --> 10:40.154
Yeah, we are!

10:40.155 --> 10:41.714
Uncle Mark, I need the loo!

10:41.715 --> 10:44.714
Yeah, just push for now,
Joshy, there's a good lad.

10:44.715 --> 10:47.834
'Is it OK to make a
five-year-old boy push a car?

10:47.835 --> 10:49.594
'It's character-building,
probably.

10:49.595 --> 10:51.354
'But he is on the exhaust side...

10:51.355 --> 10:54.554
'I'll swap in a bit. That's fair,
although he has got young lungs.'

10:54.555 --> 10:56.554
Mark? You left your...

10:56.555 --> 10:57.634
Mark, keep pushing.

10:57.635 --> 10:59.314
Sorry, what...

10:59.315 --> 11:01.034
Do you two know each other?

11:01.035 --> 11:04.154
Quickly, Mark, let's go!
We've been rumbled!

11:04.155 --> 11:06.155
"Let's go"?! Where,
Jeremy, you bloody idiot?

11:06.156 --> 11:08.154
We can't start the pissing car.

11:11.595 --> 11:13.034
Thanks a lot, mate.

11:13.035 --> 11:16.834
And apologies again
for... grifting you.

11:16.835 --> 11:17.914
I don't suppose

11:17.915 --> 11:21.834
you could maybe not mention it to
Robert at Baths, Bathrooms & Fittings?

11:21.835 --> 11:24.474
'Great, Joshy's doing a poo
in a display toilet.

11:24.475 --> 11:25.714
'The final indignity.'

11:25.715 --> 11:28.034
OK, fine.
We'll keep this between us.

11:28.035 --> 11:31.274
Thanks. Thanks so much.

11:31.275 --> 11:33.587
'Not letting you turn
round yet, old friend.

11:33.588 --> 11:35.899
This handshake's only just beginning.'

11:36.902 --> 11:40.261
OK freehold committee, prepare
to meet your new leader.

11:40.276 --> 11:42.095
I honestly think I've nailed this.

11:42.104 --> 11:45.603
I've got this great riff about bees
and their role within the hive

11:45.662 --> 11:48.421
that I think's really gonna speak
to people. Everybody loves bees.

11:48.437 --> 11:51.476
Yeah, great, just make sure you
mention the door to the bins thing.

11:51.553 --> 11:53.112
That lock is a massive ball ache.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.312
'A new bolt lock, blimey.

11:54.313 --> 11:57.592
'That's probably the kind of shit
Nick Clegg asks Cameron for.'

11:57.593 --> 12:00.312
So we have three candidates
for chairperson.

12:00.313 --> 12:02.432
Each will say just a few words about
themselves.

12:02.433 --> 12:05.312
Please let's make them all feel
very welcome.

12:05.313 --> 12:09.312
Firstly Mo Gattlen from flat 23.

12:10.513 --> 12:12.192
I'll do it if you like.

12:12.193 --> 12:15.392
'Hmm, might have overcooked this
a bit.'

12:15.393 --> 12:17.632
Next, Gail Huggins, flat 16.

12:17.633 --> 12:21.632
Thanks, Ben.

12:21.833 --> 12:24.232
Hi, my name's Gail, I've been on
the committee four years.

12:24.233 --> 12:28.192
I know how it all works and I'll do
my best to continue Ben's work.

12:28.193 --> 12:32.192
'Yep, definitely overcooked it.'

12:32.353 --> 12:35.432
And finally, Mark Corrigan, flat five.

12:35.433 --> 12:39.432
'Well, those are the starters, get.
Ready for a fucking beef wellington.'

12:42.513 --> 12:45.472
As my Latin namesake Marcus Aurelius
said,

12:45.473 --> 12:49.472
"That which is not good for the bee
hive cannot be good for the bees."

12:51.913 --> 12:53.872
And like bees, we have an equal duty

12:53.873 --> 12:57.872
to maintain and protect our home,
or hive.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.432
We've not got that long, Mark.

13:00.433 --> 13:03.632
Oh, OK. How long exactly do we...?

13:03.633 --> 13:06.512
We're finishing at seven.

13:06.513 --> 13:10.512
OK, I can skip some of this.

13:12.033 --> 13:16.032
Sorry, hang on, let me just...

13:19.353 --> 13:22.792
In conclusion then, I promise to
give us all a chance

13:22.793 --> 13:24.872
to dip our fingers into the honey pot

13:24.873 --> 13:27.792
and make the vital repairs to our hive

13:27.793 --> 13:30.792
that the current cartel of
self-interested drones

13:30.793 --> 13:33.112
have consistently blocked.

13:33.113 --> 13:37.112
My name is Mark Corrigan
and I... am an honourable man.

13:38.753 --> 13:40.632
Bins, Mark, bins.

13:40.633 --> 13:44.632
And I promise to sort out the stiff
bolt on the door of the bin store.

13:49.513 --> 13:51.712
Can I eat my dinner now, please?

13:51.713 --> 13:55.432
Well, let's ask. Do you want
the man to stop dancing, Joshy?

13:55.433 --> 13:56.592
Keep going, Jeremy.

13:56.593 --> 13:59.592
'Am I even dancing any more? It's
hard to tell without music on.'

13:59.593 --> 14:02.312
How's your food, Joshy?
Did Mummy do well?

14:02.313 --> 14:04.432
Yes, Mummy's doing very well.

14:04.433 --> 14:08.272
Do you like the man Mummy got us?
He's funny, isn't he?

14:08.273 --> 14:09.912
Yes, he's very funny.

14:10.513 --> 14:14.512
'I'm a toy boy in the
sense that I am a toy for a boy.'

14:14.753 --> 14:16.032
Hi, Jez.

14:16.033 --> 14:17.272
Oh, hi.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.432
Hello, Uncle Mark.

14:18.433 --> 14:21.072
Hi, Joshy...

14:21.073 --> 14:25.072
So looks like I'm the new Apollo
House freehold committee chairman.

14:25.073 --> 14:27.512
Hey, here's to Chairman Mark...

14:27.513 --> 14:30.192
or Chairman Malc... Chairmark Mao.

14:30.193 --> 14:33.552
Let's hope my aggressive land reforms
don't lead to widespread famine.

14:33.553 --> 14:34.992
What do you mean famine?

14:34.993 --> 14:37.472
I was referencing some of
Chairman Mao's policies.

14:37.473 --> 14:39.512
I don't know how much
you know about him.

14:39.513 --> 14:41.432
I know his name. Right.

14:41.433 --> 14:43.752
Mark, if you plan to use Jez
as a driver again,

14:43.753 --> 14:47.272
then you have to check his Google
calendar first to see if he's free.

14:47.273 --> 14:49.672
- Ooh, have I got a calendar?
- Yes, will do.

14:49.673 --> 14:52.832
Write any requests in blue. If I
OK them I'll change them to green.

14:52.833 --> 14:53.912
Gotcha.

14:53.913 --> 14:55.072
Can I see my calendar?

14:55.073 --> 14:55.672
No need, babe.

14:57.073 --> 14:58.792
Oh... What?

14:58.793 --> 15:00.512
"Babe"? Going well then, is it?

15:00.513 --> 15:03.352
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's great.
She's great, it's all great.

15:03.353 --> 15:05.312
But there is this one thing.

15:05.313 --> 15:07.552
You want to have sex with thousands
of other people?

15:07.553 --> 15:11.552
Not that. It's just that her tastes
have changed a bit in the bedroom.

15:11.953 --> 15:15.072
Yeah, I probably definitely don't
want to hear about this whatsoever.

15:15.073 --> 15:18.832
I'm cool with S&M,
and obviously if she wants to be S

15:18.833 --> 15:22.272
then I have to be M.
I mean, we can't both be the M.

15:22.273 --> 15:23.352
I don't want to know.

15:23.353 --> 15:25.832
I think it's cos of Fifty Shades
of Grey.

15:25.833 --> 15:28.552
I think reading that has made
her very horny

15:28.553 --> 15:31.072
but at the same time very angry.

15:31.073 --> 15:34.552
Right, I'm not sure it counts as
S&M if it's not consensual.

15:34.553 --> 15:36.672
Oh, you're the S&M expert
all of a sudden, are you?

15:36.673 --> 15:39.032
Mr I'm So Scared Of Women Touching
My Arsehole

15:39.033 --> 15:40.672
I Pretend It's Really Ticklish?

15:40.673 --> 15:42.192
It is really ticklish.

15:42.193 --> 15:44.752
For fuck's sake! Simon was meant
to take Joshy on the weekend

15:44.753 --> 15:48.072
and now he's going to Chicago,
the utter bastard.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.312
'Nice one, Simon, that's me getting hit

15:50.313 --> 15:54.312
'with a selection of objects all
fucking night.'

15:54.473 --> 15:56.792
As a representative of this store,

15:56.793 --> 15:59.792
everything you do on the road comes
straight back to me.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.672
'God, I would love to pop that spot.

16:02.673 --> 16:06.672
'Just put a hot flannel on there and
then crack that mother wide open.

16:07.833 --> 16:09.792
'That would be a great night in
for me.'

16:09.793 --> 16:11.032
Are you listening, Mark?

16:11.033 --> 16:14.032
Yes, sir, of course,
and I want to apologise.

16:14.033 --> 16:16.512
The fact is, Robert, it was my
driver's idea.

16:16.513 --> 16:20.512
He very much started grifting
without my say-so.

16:20.593 --> 16:22.592
I was barely involved.

16:22.593 --> 16:23.832
Started what, sorry?

16:23.833 --> 16:26.312
Conning Mr Franks, who said he
wouldn't tell you,

16:26.313 --> 16:30.312
but... well, clearly he has.

16:30.433 --> 16:33.072
Right, cos I got a call from
Alan Magernagey at Lutterworth

16:33.073 --> 16:34.832
about you leaving a number

16:34.833 --> 16:37.032
of editions of some book you've
written,

16:37.033 --> 16:41.032
Business something of the
Pharaohs, in display toilets.

16:41.073 --> 16:42.232
'Bollocks!'

16:42.233 --> 16:43.872
I haven't heard from Dave Franks.

16:43.873 --> 16:45.432
Yes. Um...

16:45.433 --> 16:47.552
'Great work, Mark.
No need for the Water Board,

16:47.553 --> 16:49.232
'just show me the poppable
whitehead.'

16:50.073 --> 16:52.592
Did you try and con Dave Franks?

16:52.593 --> 16:54.552
Can you just give me a second,
please, Robert?

16:54.553 --> 16:56.472
Hello.

16:56.473 --> 16:59.432
They're saying they can either do it
now or it'll be another six weeks.

16:59.433 --> 17:01.112
'Six weeks for a new wall?!'

17:01.113 --> 17:03.352
I need her to move in quicker
than six weeks.

17:03.353 --> 17:05.912
They're saying it'll cost 9,000
plus VAT.

17:05.913 --> 17:07.551
£10,800?

17:07.553 --> 17:09.232
'That is fantastic maths.'

17:09.233 --> 17:11.112
It was supposed to be about 700 quid.

17:11.113 --> 17:14.152
I can't spend that. That's
virtually the entire sinking fund.

17:14.153 --> 17:15.551
Hang on. Robert, hi.

17:15.553 --> 17:18.112
Yeah, I just spoke to Dave Franks.

17:18.113 --> 17:20.672
Apparently you and another bloke
tried to swindle him

17:20.673 --> 17:22.952
and then one of
you did a shit in a display toilet.

17:22.953 --> 17:24.693
That wasn't us, there was
also a five-year-old boy.

17:24.694 --> 17:26.432
He didn't mention a boy.

17:26.433 --> 17:30.432
There honestly was one. The shit
will be child-sized, if you ask him.

17:30.433 --> 17:31.752
I'm not asking him that.

17:31.753 --> 17:34.912
OK. Am I fired?

17:34.913 --> 17:37.432
- Yes.
- Right.

17:37.433 --> 17:40.552
I'm approving it, it's coming
out of the sinking fund.

17:40.553 --> 17:44.552
I'm the chairman and I'll transfer
the money in five.

17:45.433 --> 17:46.552
Hold the lift, please.

17:46.553 --> 17:47.872
Right, yes.

17:47.873 --> 17:49.952
'Do I look like a bloody bell boy?

17:49.953 --> 17:53.912
'Although maybe that could be my new
job, a freelance bell boy.'

17:53.913 --> 17:55.632
Oh, it's the honourable man.

17:55.633 --> 17:57.152
Yes, hello...

17:57.153 --> 17:59.792
'Don't say Mother Hubbard,
don't say Mother Hubbard.'

17:59.793 --> 18:01.912
deary.

18:01.913 --> 18:03.712
You're just what this place needs,
you know,

18:03.713 --> 18:06.912
someone to stop the rot,
fix the broken tiles...

18:06.913 --> 18:09.192
'Yes, can't really do any of that,
though,

18:09.193 --> 18:13.032
'cos I've spunked the sinking fund
within 24 hours of leadership.'

18:13.033 --> 18:16.992
All great suggestions, but, having
looked at the accounts,

18:16.993 --> 18:20.832
I think it's better
if we actually don't do that

18:20.833 --> 18:23.112
and just keep it for emergencies.

18:23.113 --> 18:25.352
Oh! Right...

18:25.353 --> 18:27.592
'And by "emergencies",
I presumably mean

18:27.593 --> 18:30.552
'things that really matter, like if
my DVD player stops working

18:30.553 --> 18:32.872
'or if I really want a Nando's.

18:32.873 --> 18:34.392
'God, what have I become?

18:34.393 --> 18:38.352
'I'm Mobutu, gilding my royal palace
while my people starve

18:38.353 --> 18:40.392
'in their squalid, AIDS-y
townships.

18:40.393 --> 18:42.632
'Maybe Mobutu did it all
for his girlfriend.'

18:42.633 --> 18:43.792
Hey, flatmate!

18:43.793 --> 18:46.312
'Back from the dead,
the zombie flatmate,

18:46.313 --> 18:48.352
'come to eat my brains
and my Cheddar.'

18:48.353 --> 18:49.392
I've had a big think

18:49.393 --> 18:52.152
and decided you were right about me
leeching off Sarah,

18:52.153 --> 18:53.512
so I'm back!

18:53.513 --> 18:55.232
I've ordered us a pizza

18:55.233 --> 18:58.912
and I've found an amazing YouTube
clip of a monkey riding a pig.

18:58.913 --> 19:02.152
So let's just hunker down and veg out!

19:02.153 --> 19:04.152
Look, mate, you don't live
here any more.

19:04.153 --> 19:06.552
But I've moved all my stuff back.

19:06.553 --> 19:08.152
You mean you've returned my chairs.

19:08.153 --> 19:09.072
And my clothes.

19:09.073 --> 19:12.272
And my porn case. Don't make me move
that again. It's really heavy.

19:12.273 --> 19:15.152
Funnily enough, the weight of your
old-school pornography

19:15.153 --> 19:17.712
isn't breaking my heart,
Jeremy. The damp's all fixed,

19:17.713 --> 19:19.432
Dobby's moving in, and...

19:19.433 --> 19:21.392
I can't take it any more at
Sarah's. OK?

19:21.393 --> 19:24.512
It's not just the S&M,
it's the cooking and the cleaning

19:24.513 --> 19:26.272
and the constant dancing.

19:26.273 --> 19:30.272
I'm like some pole-dancing,
oven-scrubbing migrant sex worker.

19:30.873 --> 19:33.512
Let me back into the First
World, Mark, please.

19:33.513 --> 19:35.072
I'm sorry, Jez.

19:35.073 --> 19:37.912
'Don't weaken, Mark. He's only your
best and oldest friend.

19:37.913 --> 19:40.832
'You owe him zilch.'

19:40.833 --> 19:42.893
I really appreciate this, Andy.

19:42.894 --> 19:44.952
Yeah, I mean, I ain't got
a bed or nothing for ya.

19:44.953 --> 19:48.952
I've got a free sort of... corner
you can have.

19:49.593 --> 19:51.752
Great. I can sleep in a corner.

19:51.753 --> 19:54.632
'Brilliant. Flat-sharing with a
psycho. "Who's in the corner?"

19:54.633 --> 19:55.912
'"Oh, that's my life coach.

19:55.913 --> 19:59.232
'"That shivering, pale man with the
suitcase of porn is helping me

19:59.233 --> 20:04.192
- ' "get my life back on track." '
- I haven't really got any bedding.

20:04.273 --> 20:07.632
All right?

20:07.633 --> 20:10.432
'I'm sleeping in a bin bag.
I'm human rubbish.

20:10.433 --> 20:12.672
'My sixth-form careers
advisor was right all along.

20:12.673 --> 20:15.352
'It's not even a thick green
one for garden waste.

20:15.353 --> 20:19.352
'This is black for landfill.
I belong in landfill.'

20:21.273 --> 20:22.952
Oh, wow!

20:22.953 --> 20:24.672
To moving in. Finally!

20:24.673 --> 20:25.752
Indeed.

20:25.753 --> 20:28.472
'Let's celebrate with an
inaugural stain.

20:28.473 --> 20:30.992
'I'll try to refrain from squirting
the Vanish

20:30.993 --> 20:32.712
'till after this tender moment.'

20:32.713 --> 20:35.432
I'm really excited, Mark, I just
know it's going to be great.

20:35.433 --> 20:37.352
- 'Sounds almost convincing.'
- Cheers!

20:38.553 --> 20:39.992
Hi!

20:39.993 --> 20:41.312
It's me.

20:41.313 --> 20:42.352
'Oh, what now?'

20:42.353 --> 20:43.672
I forgot my Mega Drive.

20:43.673 --> 20:46.952
I forgot the one thing I own
I can't masturbate to, or in.

20:46.953 --> 20:49.632
OK, well, I'll bag that up for
you, and...

20:49.633 --> 20:51.232
Also, can I stay?

20:51.233 --> 20:54.592
I slept in a bin bag at Andy's and...

20:54.593 --> 20:56.152
I couldn't really handle it.

20:56.153 --> 20:57.312
Big Mad Andy?

20:57.313 --> 21:00.872
Yeah. But the good news is that
Super Hans' bag is now available.

21:00.873 --> 21:03.312
And that's a sleeping bag, not
a bin bag,

21:03.313 --> 21:05.752
but it does have someone
sleeping in it tonight.

21:05.753 --> 21:07.992
But tomorrow, it's mine, all mine.

21:07.993 --> 21:10.552
'Poor bastard!' Of course you can
stay the night, Jez.

21:10.553 --> 21:13.352
We're going to have pizza.
I want Hawaiian.

21:13.353 --> 21:14.992
Oh, he won't have that.

21:14.993 --> 21:16.832
I just don't want fruit on my pizza,

21:16.833 --> 21:19.472
just like I'd rather not have
melon in my lasagne.

21:19.473 --> 21:21.472
'And that's why I never
cooked it again.'

21:21.473 --> 21:23.032
Let's play a bit of Street Fighter.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.872
Great! 'Sorry, Mark,

21:24.873 --> 21:26.912
'I'll fight Dobby, but not my feelings.

21:26.913 --> 21:29.912
'I like my feelings, my naughty,
naughty feelings.'

21:29.913 --> 21:33.312
But what about the new
Danish drama on BBC4?

21:33.313 --> 21:36.432
Apparently, it's like The Killing,
but more bureaucratic.

21:36.433 --> 21:39.072
Hey, Mark, if Jez needs a bit
of time to sort himself out,

21:39.073 --> 21:40.232
then the move can wait.

21:40.233 --> 21:42.792
I've got some stuff in a Big Yellow
storage unit anyway

21:42.793 --> 21:44.432
that I need to get before I pack up.

21:44.433 --> 21:47.072
'And there it is, finally,

21:47.073 --> 21:50.712
'a big, yellow storage unit
full of big, yellow bullshit.

21:50.713 --> 21:52.592
'She's fallen into my trap.

21:52.593 --> 21:55.552
'After all I've done, she still
invents reasons not to move in.

21:55.553 --> 21:57.232
'I knew she didn't love me.

21:57.233 --> 22:00.632
'Now, all I have to do is get her to
admit it, and then I win.

22:00.633 --> 22:04.632
'Somehow, that means I win.'
