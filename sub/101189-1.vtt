[alarm beeping]

03:54.843 --> 03:57.498
[door clicking]

04:16.517 --> 04:18.345
- [Professor] It was one of
the strongest applications

04:18.387 --> 04:20.521
we've seen in years,

04:20.564 --> 04:23.175
and your essay touched many
people on the committee.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.266
- Well, I just want
to say thanks again,

04:26.309 --> 04:31.445
for the support and
everything you've done for me.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.795
- You've proven you deserve
to be here, Rebecca,

04:33.838 --> 04:34.926
and you'll be a real asset

04:34.970 --> 04:37.189
to the Neuroscience
Nursing program.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.061
And I want to assure you
that there are people here

04:39.104 --> 04:40.584
who understand your situation.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.108
We're a very diverse group,

04:43.152 --> 04:46.460
and some of us have personal
experiences much like yours,

04:46.503 --> 04:50.986
with unique and challenging
family circumstances.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.075
I think we've covered
everything for now.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.946
We're very excited
to have you here.

04:54.990 --> 04:58.428
- I'm excited, a little
scared but very excited.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.518
I've never actually
been on a plane before.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.651
- It won't be a long flight.

05:03.694 --> 05:05.217
If everything's
covered on your end,

05:05.261 --> 05:06.958
we'll see you here on the 17th.

05:07.002 --> 05:10.092
- The 17th? That's
like a week away.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.441
- We've got a lot
of ground to cover

05:11.485 --> 05:13.356
to get you all caught up.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.054
This is a very
special circumstance

05:16.098 --> 05:18.579
and in order to make sure
you won't fall behind

05:18.622 --> 05:20.798
we'll need you here
as soon as possible.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.452
- Right, right, yeah.

05:23.627 --> 05:26.761
The 17th. I'll be there.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.983
[gentle music]

[water bubbling]

06:01.926 --> 06:03.667
[phone ringing]

06:03.711 --> 06:04.668
- [Richie] You know what to do.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.191
- Hey, it's me.

06:06.235 --> 06:07.976
I was hoping you'd pick up.

06:10.761 --> 06:13.024
Look, I'm headed to work soon.

06:13.068 --> 06:16.941
And I was wondering if maybe
we could meet up afterwards.

06:16.985 --> 06:19.596
I'll be done at 3:00 so I
could come by yours after?

06:20.467 --> 06:21.511
I know you'll be up.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.514
Just check in, okay?

06:27.822 --> 06:29.389
I need to talk to
you about something.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.396
I love you, bye.

06:43.577 --> 06:46.580
[traffic whooshing]

06:52.455 --> 06:55.371
[quiet rock music]

07:04.815 --> 07:06.077
- Hey, everything okay?

07:10.081 --> 07:10.908
Becca?

07:12.432 --> 07:13.476
Becca?

07:13.520 --> 07:14.477
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:14.521 --> 07:18.002
- Yeah, hey, everything's fine.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.526
- [Mel] So, how'd it go?

07:19.569 --> 07:20.657
- What?

07:20.701 --> 07:22.180
- I thought you had
that call today?

07:22.224 --> 07:23.704
- Oh, yeah, it went great.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.272
They want me there for the 17th.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.492
- Shit, that's like next week.

07:29.536 --> 07:30.406
- Yeah.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.323
- [Mel] That's a
good thing, right?

07:35.803 --> 07:37.979
- [Becca] It's great,
I mean, it's amazing.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.154
It's just--

07:39.197 --> 07:40.329
- [Mel] You still
haven't told Richie.

07:41.548 --> 07:42.679
- He's in a good place.

07:42.723 --> 07:43.941
You know, I don't
want to jinx it.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.073
- If he's in a good place,

07:45.116 --> 07:47.031
then it's the best
time to tell him.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.294
He's your brother,
he'll understand, okay?

07:50.557 --> 07:53.124
[upbeat music]

08:17.235 --> 08:18.585
- [Operator] Your
mailbox is full.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.543
To listen to your
messages press--

08:20.587 --> 08:21.979
[phone clicks]

08:22.023 --> 08:23.198
- [Richie] I know what
you said the other day

08:23.241 --> 08:24.808
about not everything
being an emergency.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.418
And I'm not trying to freak
you out or anything like that

08:26.462 --> 08:29.378
because everything
is under control.

08:29.421 --> 08:30.640
But something's going on

08:30.684 --> 08:31.641
and I don't want to get
into it over the phone

08:31.685 --> 08:33.077
because you really
need to be here

08:33.121 --> 08:34.296
to understand what's happening

08:34.339 --> 08:36.864
and I really think
it'll blow your mind.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.126
[phone clicking]

08:38.169 --> 08:40.083
Pick up, pick up, pick up!

08:40.128 --> 08:42.086
Pick up, pick up,
Becca, come on.

08:42.130 --> 08:45.046
Don't make me beg, just come
over as soon as you get this.

08:45.089 --> 08:47.222
Like I was saying, if I
start getting into it,

08:47.265 --> 08:49.703
you're gonna think I'm crazy,
and it's not about that.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.879
[phone beeps]

08:51.922 --> 08:54.969
You really need to be here.

08:55.012 --> 08:55.883
I need your help.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.624
Please, Becca, I don't.

09:00.104 --> 09:03.586
[phone beeps]
[phone ringing]

09:03.630 --> 09:04.587
You know what to do.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.894
[phone beeps]

09:06.937 --> 09:09.592
[keys clicking]

[phone beeps]

09:17.121 --> 09:19.733
[phone ringing]

09:19.776 --> 09:20.777
You know what to do.

[Becca groaning]

09:27.828 --> 09:30.700
[upbeat music]

09:30.744 --> 09:31.658
- What now?

09:32.615 --> 09:34.225
- Richie left me
some weird messages

09:34.269 --> 09:36.140
and now he's not picking up.

09:36.184 --> 09:38.229
Is it okay if I just run
out and check on him,

09:38.273 --> 09:39.491
just get it over with

09:39.535 --> 09:41.232
and then I'll be back
in 30 minutes, tops.

09:41.276 --> 09:44.061
[Mel groans]

09:44.105 --> 09:46.368
- Fine, but you
gotta make it quick.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.544
It's gonna pick up in
here once the game starts.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.763
- I'll be right back.

09:50.764 --> 09:51.591
- Hey, Becca?

09:53.593 --> 09:54.898
Promise me you'll tell him.

09:58.510 --> 10:01.513
[traffic whooshing]

10:04.081 --> 10:06.649
[somber music]

10:16.572 --> 10:17.834
- [Driver] Rebecca?

10:17.878 --> 10:18.705
- [Becca] Yeah.

10:24.798 --> 10:27.888
[singing in foreign language]

10:27.931 --> 10:29.716
- [GPS] In 100
meters, turn right.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.110
Recalculating.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.157
- It takes us
straight to a detour,

10:36.200 --> 10:39.247
which just takes us to another
detour. There's no logic.

10:40.988 --> 10:43.120
Turn right, nope, it's closed.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.426
Go back this way.

10:44.469 --> 10:46.167
Guess what, we're
stuck in a loop.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.735
- [GPS] Recalculating.

10:48.778 --> 10:49.736
[singing in foreign language]

10:58.440 --> 11:01.486
[faint upbeat music]

11:16.588 --> 11:17.720
- [Becca] The music?

11:17.764 --> 11:18.634
I'm so sorry.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.896
- It's been going on all night.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.116
If it's not that music,
it's that vibration.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.944
It shakes the whole building.

11:23.987 --> 11:25.859
I know I said I wasn't
gonna call the cops again,

11:25.902 --> 11:27.774
but some of us
have to work, Okay?

11:27.817 --> 11:30.124
Some of us need a
little peace and quiet.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.255
- I totally get it.

11:31.299 --> 11:32.735
- I don't think you do, Rebecca.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.737
Because if you did, this
wouldn't keep happening,

11:34.781 --> 11:36.043
but it does keep happening.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.218
- Well I'm gonna go
deal with it right now.

11:37.261 --> 11:38.828
- No need, I called the super,

11:38.872 --> 11:40.743
he's gonna come here
tomorrow bright and early

11:40.787 --> 11:42.266
and he's gonna have a little
chat with your brother.

11:42.310 --> 11:43.137
- Why would you do that?

11:43.180 --> 11:44.747
- Because I've had it, okay?

11:44.791 --> 11:46.793
It's either your
brother or it's me.

11:46.836 --> 11:47.794
And I'm not leaving.

11:47.837 --> 11:51.667
- Great.
[electricity sizzling]

11:51.711 --> 11:54.017
- Excuse me, I'm not done
speaking with [sighs].

11:55.149 --> 11:56.672
These people are such trash!

11:56.716 --> 11:59.109
[door thuds]

12:01.459 --> 12:04.724
[blaring upbeat music]

12:07.596 --> 12:12.601
- Richie!

12:12.644 --> 12:13.471
Richie!

12:17.084 --> 12:18.259
What the hell?

12:21.523 --> 12:24.265
[dramatic music]

12:25.483 --> 12:28.138
[door creaking]

12:30.445 --> 12:31.272
No!

12:32.099 --> 12:33.013
No, no, no!

12:40.672 --> 12:44.851
No. [sobbing]

12:57.820 --> 12:58.690
- [Richie] Hey, thanks
for showing up finally.

12:58.734 --> 13:01.389
[Becca gasping]

13:05.697 --> 13:07.656
Hey, earth to--
[both screaming]

13:07.699 --> 13:09.049
- Richie!

13:09.092 --> 13:09.919
- Becca!

13:11.791 --> 13:12.922
- Cover yourself up!

13:18.275 --> 13:22.323
- I was having the
weirdest dream.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.716
- No, I thought
you were in the closet.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.675
- In the closet.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.329
- [Becca] You are in the closet.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.333
- Oh!

13:32.376 --> 13:33.551
[tape rewinding]

13:33.595 --> 13:36.337
[Richie gasping]

13:37.468 --> 13:38.295
Right.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.822
[ominous music]

13:42.865 --> 13:44.649
- What the hell is
going on, Richie?

13:59.926 --> 14:00.752
[Richie groaning]

14:00.796 --> 14:01.623
- Come on!

14:18.161 --> 14:18.988
Okay, watch.

14:23.036 --> 14:25.865
This is my third attempt.

14:27.170 --> 14:29.042
I'm writing everything
down in a journal,

14:29.085 --> 14:33.089
which is good, 'cause it's
really fuzzy up here, but.

14:34.308 --> 14:37.702
It's [laughing] it's
a total mind-fuck.

14:38.616 --> 14:40.183
You know, seeing yourself dead.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.446
It's just, I mean,

14:45.449 --> 14:50.454
wow, I've seen hallucinations
and shit but...

14:52.587 --> 14:56.852
This, this is [laughing]

14:56.896 --> 15:00.943
I mean, like, this is real.

15:00.987 --> 15:01.944
- Turn it off.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.685
- Wait, hold on, there's more.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.861
So I keep waking up butt naked

15:05.905 --> 15:08.777
and at first I
thought this was mold

15:08.820 --> 15:10.170
or something like that

15:10.213 --> 15:13.260
but I think it's something
completely different.

15:13.303 --> 15:15.653
As far as I can tell,
this is where it happens.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.483
Okay, this is where
it gets weird.

15:20.876 --> 15:23.618
[film crackling]

15:24.706 --> 15:25.533
See!

15:26.577 --> 15:27.970
Did you see that?

15:28.014 --> 15:31.582
I can't get it on tape
because it keeps messing up.

15:31.626 --> 15:32.627
But you were here,
what did you see?

15:32.670 --> 15:33.367
- What do you mean?

15:33.410 --> 15:34.455
I wasn't in the room.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.981
- You couldn't have come
over five minutes earlier!

15:40.983 --> 15:41.853
Wait, where were you?

15:41.897 --> 15:42.637
I've been calling you all day.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.943
- I was at work.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.683
When I got your messages
I tried calling you back

15:45.727 --> 15:47.207
but you didn't pick up.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.426
- Yeah, I don't know
what I did with my phone.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.038
You're here now, that's great.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.996
I need you to pay attention.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.433
Okay, just stay
there, one second.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.264
- Did you stop
taking your pills?

16:01.308 --> 16:02.135
- No.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.486
Yes, I like...that's
beside the point.

16:06.487 --> 16:07.357
What's wrong?

16:07.401 --> 16:08.576
Do you not see what's going on?

16:08.619 --> 16:09.577
- No, I do see what's
going on, Richie,

16:09.620 --> 16:10.839
and I don't have
time to get pulled

16:10.882 --> 16:13.450
into another one of
your weird art projects.

16:13.494 --> 16:15.583
God dammit, I thought
something happened!

16:15.626 --> 16:18.281
- Something did happen!

16:18.325 --> 16:20.327
- I want to be here
and I want to help you

16:20.370 --> 16:21.850
but I have to go right now.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.547
I'm done at 3:00, I
can come back here

16:23.591 --> 16:25.071
and we can figure
this out together.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.681
- Please, please, Becca.

16:26.724 --> 16:29.118
- Now, I can see that things
are really intense right now.

16:29.162 --> 16:33.557
Okay, all right,
but I'll be back.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.385
But I need you to
keep the music off

16:35.429 --> 16:39.302
and stop whatever this
is until then, okay?

16:40.260 --> 16:41.739
Okay.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.002
- Becca, I can't figure this
out without you watching.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.568
Okay, please, I just,
I need you to watch.

16:44.612 --> 16:45.482
Please, just stay.

16:45.526 --> 16:46.962
Don't, just look, okay, look!

16:47.006 --> 16:47.832
Look!

16:49.921 --> 16:51.532
[Becca gasps]

16:51.575 --> 16:54.230
[phone ringing]

16:56.885 --> 16:58.974
[Becca groans]

16:59.018 --> 17:00.932
- Hey, everything okay?

17:00.976 --> 17:03.587
- Yeah, it's worse
that I thought.

17:03.631 --> 17:04.980
- [Mel] Is Richie all right?

17:07.242 --> 17:09.289
- Yeah, he doesn't look so good.

17:09.332 --> 17:14.163
Ah, I don't think
I can leave yet.

17:14.207 --> 17:15.772
I'll call you back later, okay?

17:20.865 --> 17:22.345
What the fuck is
going on, Richie?

17:22.388 --> 17:23.825
- It's all in
here, which is good

17:23.867 --> 17:26.088
because things up here
are a little bit jumbled.

17:27.959 --> 17:28.786
Okay, see?

17:28.830 --> 17:30.571
- What the fuck is going on!

17:30.614 --> 17:32.660
- Just relax, okay, relax.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.488
- Relax? Relax!

17:34.531 --> 17:36.925
There are dead bodies all
over the apartment, Richie.

17:36.968 --> 17:37.839
Your dead bodies!

17:37.882 --> 17:39.275
- Just shut up, okay!

17:39.319 --> 17:40.929
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
that was very mean.

17:40.972 --> 17:41.756
I love you.

17:41.799 --> 17:43.279
Look, just listen.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.977
I called you because
something bad did happen.

17:47.979 --> 17:49.198
I killed myself.

17:50.678 --> 17:53.420
But then something
amazing happened.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.074
- I don't understand.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.641
- I've already died three times.

17:57.685 --> 18:01.080
And I have come
back three times.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.211
But I don't know how.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.082
I thought the video
would capture it

18:03.125 --> 18:03.995
but you saw what happened.

18:04.039 --> 18:06.172
So I need you to be the video.

18:06.215 --> 18:07.738
- [Becca] What do you mean?

18:07.782 --> 18:10.263
- I need you in my room to
just watch what happens next.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.526
- [Becca] Okay, and
where will you be?

18:12.569 --> 18:13.962
- I'll be dead.

18:14.005 --> 18:14.789
- What? Wait!

18:14.832 --> 18:16.269
What do you mean?

18:16.312 --> 18:17.574
- I'm gonna kill myself.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.229
And I need you to be in here

18:21.361 --> 18:23.102
to just watch what happens next.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.233
- No.

18:24.277 --> 18:25.887
- Becca, please.
- No, no way!

18:25.930 --> 18:27.541
Don't you dare!

18:27.584 --> 18:28.977
Don't you dare!

18:29.020 --> 18:32.111
[somber music]

18:32.154 --> 18:34.504
[Richie sighs]

18:34.548 --> 18:36.985
[door thuds]

18:42.208 --> 18:45.298
[gentle jazzy music]

18:49.911 --> 18:51.173
[bass rumbling]

18:51.217 --> 18:56.178
- Oh, no you don't.

18:56.657 --> 19:00.313
[broomstick thudding]

19:00.356 --> 19:02.880
[Becca sighs]

19:04.447 --> 19:07.189
[dramatic music]

19:08.277 --> 19:10.714
[door thuds]

19:11.585 --> 19:12.934
- You came back.

19:16.067 --> 19:19.419
- Richie, this has to
stop, right now, okay.

19:19.462 --> 19:24.337
The music and whatever
this is, has to stop.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.817
- I'm not trying
to scare you, okay.

19:26.861 --> 19:28.732
I get it, this is really weird.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.344
But take a look around.

19:31.387 --> 19:32.519
I'm not making this up.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.651
I'm not spiralling,
this is happening.

19:34.695 --> 19:38.133
So let's just, you
know, go with it.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.569
- I'm not comfortable with this.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.397
- It's already done.

19:41.441 --> 19:42.616
- What's already done?

19:42.659 --> 19:44.008
- I took something
when you stepped out.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.749
So it's gonna be
kicking in pretty soon.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.360
- Jesus, Richie!

19:47.403 --> 19:49.579
- It's fine, it's fine, really.

19:49.623 --> 19:50.406
- [Becca] Oh my God.

19:50.450 --> 19:51.364
- No, no, no, I'm good.

19:51.407 --> 19:52.495
I'm good, really.

19:52.539 --> 19:53.888
I'm fine.

19:53.931 --> 19:55.933
[somber music]

19:55.977 --> 19:58.109
- [Becca] We need to get
you to a hospital, Richie.

19:58.153 --> 19:58.980
- Uh uh.

20:00.677 --> 20:02.244
You've seen my bodies.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.245
Just trust me.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.553
I'll come back, I promise.

20:10.034 --> 20:11.906
When I'm gone, go in my bedroom.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.430
Write down what you see.

20:20.001 --> 20:23.961
It's like when I had
heatstroke in Hampton Beach.

20:25.528 --> 20:26.355
- Not really.

20:28.662 --> 20:32.013
- You held my hand
all night long.

20:32.056 --> 20:35.277
[gentle music]

20:35.321 --> 20:36.365
- I remember.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.200
I remember when you
puked on my prom date

20:45.244 --> 20:47.158
before we even had
a chance to leave.

20:48.682 --> 20:51.424
'Cause you drank an
entire bottle of schnapps.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.644
- Darryl something.

20:54.688 --> 20:56.298
- Darryl Friedman.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.822
- [laughs] He had it comin'.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.483
- I remember last year when
I got a call from the cops

21:07.527 --> 21:12.532
at 3:00 in the morning saying
they took you to the hospital.

21:16.187 --> 21:18.146
How I felt when I
saw you in that room.

21:20.714 --> 21:21.671
I thought...

21:26.328 --> 21:27.242
Never mind.

21:31.638 --> 21:35.163
Richie, I have to
tell you something.

21:35.206 --> 21:35.990
[Richie farts]

21:36.033 --> 21:37.557
Oh!

21:37.600 --> 21:38.427
You dick!

21:41.430 --> 21:42.301
Richie?

21:44.694 --> 21:45.521
Richie?

21:50.918 --> 21:53.834
[ominous rumbling]

22:00.319 --> 22:04.148
[singing in foreign language]

22:08.979 --> 22:11.155
[flesh squelching]

22:11.199 --> 22:14.115
[Becca whimpering]

22:18.511 --> 22:23.167
Oh my God... [groaning]

22:40.837 --> 22:43.362
[membrane tearing]

22:43.405 --> 22:46.321
[fluid squelching]

22:56.418 --> 22:58.159
[both screaming]

22:58.202 --> 23:01.423
- [Richie] What the fuck are
you doing in my apartment?

23:01.467 --> 23:03.294
- Put some clothes on.

23:08.169 --> 23:10.824
[ominous music]

23:12.956 --> 23:14.741
[Richie sighing]

23:14.784 --> 23:16.438
- I'm starving.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.396
Why do you look so freaked?

23:21.356 --> 23:23.010
What the hell is that?

23:23.053 --> 23:23.880
[Richie screaming]

23:23.924 --> 23:26.361
[Richie gasping]

23:26.405 --> 23:27.231
Right.

23:38.199 --> 23:39.679
- How many fingers?

23:39.722 --> 23:40.549
- Come on.

23:43.509 --> 23:44.379
Three.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.556
- Touch your nose with
your pointer finger.

23:49.253 --> 23:50.341
Now touch my finger.

23:53.214 --> 23:54.345
How do you feel?

23:54.389 --> 23:55.216
- Annoyed.

23:55.259 --> 23:56.522
- [Becca] For real.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.262
- I don't know, my brain hurts.

23:59.307 --> 24:00.221
- Okay, hurts how?

24:00.264 --> 24:01.875
Like, sharp, throbbing?

24:01.918 --> 24:04.573
- Like fuzzy, or
something, just...

24:06.140 --> 24:08.447
Like I can kind
of remember things

24:08.490 --> 24:10.318
and I also kind of don't.

24:10.361 --> 24:12.581
It's all just layered
on top of itself.

24:12.625 --> 24:15.758
So my mind is getting
really worn down.

24:15.802 --> 24:18.195
Like if you were
making a copy of a tape

24:18.239 --> 24:20.197
that's already a copy of a
tape, do you know what I mean?

24:20.241 --> 24:22.199
- No, not really.

24:22.243 --> 24:23.331
- Okay, okay.

24:23.374 --> 24:24.637
Remember the audio
pieces that I made

24:24.680 --> 24:26.943
with Mom and Dad's
voices when we were kids?

24:26.987 --> 24:30.077
So if you used the same tape,
over and over and over again,

24:30.120 --> 24:31.557
back and forth, then the sound,

24:31.600 --> 24:33.820
it starts to get really weird

24:33.863 --> 24:36.953
and you can hear whatever
you just recorded,

24:36.997 --> 24:39.303
but then everything else startsto fade in the background

24:39.347 --> 24:42.655
and it gets degraded,
and it's layer on layer.

24:42.698 --> 24:45.484
So the new stuff that you
record, it sounds great.

24:45.527 --> 24:46.963
And then the old
stuff, not so much.

24:49.096 --> 24:53.187
- Okay, so you're like a
copy of a copy of a copy.

24:54.405 --> 24:55.232
- Of a copy.

25:00.150 --> 25:00.977
- What day is it?

25:03.023 --> 25:03.893
- Tuesday.

25:03.937 --> 25:04.720
- It's Saturday.

25:04.764 --> 25:05.939
- Yeah, okay, it could be.

25:05.982 --> 25:06.853
I never know what day
of the week it is.

25:06.896 --> 25:07.897
- [Becca] Okay, what year is it?

25:07.941 --> 25:08.768
- 2019.

25:08.811 --> 25:09.899
Why are we doing this?

25:09.943 --> 25:11.988
- Well, you might
have brain damage.

25:14.425 --> 25:15.557
- Oh fuck.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.907
- Or, I don't know,
you were just born

25:17.951 --> 25:20.954
so your mind is
building new pathways.

25:20.997 --> 25:22.912
I mean, neurons and
synapses are firing

25:22.956 --> 25:25.001
through your brain like
a spray of bullets.

25:25.045 --> 25:27.700
Which actually might
explain the delay.

25:27.743 --> 25:30.050
I mean, especially the
short-term memory loss.

25:32.095 --> 25:33.096
Show me your scar.

25:37.361 --> 25:38.188
Oh my God.

25:40.147 --> 25:41.540
You're like, the same.

25:41.583 --> 25:42.715
- [Richie] All right,
you know what, stop.

25:42.758 --> 25:45.152
I need to get something to eat.

25:45.195 --> 25:47.720
- Like, exactly the same.

25:52.202 --> 25:54.944
- So I can't die. [laughs]

26:00.471 --> 26:01.734
I'm like, immortal.

26:10.177 --> 26:11.395
Becca, I think I'm good.

26:13.006 --> 26:13.833
- Take them.

26:15.661 --> 26:16.575
- All right, fine.

26:29.675 --> 26:30.589
- Okay, good.

26:37.508 --> 26:40.250
[water gurgling]

26:43.253 --> 26:45.995
[dramatic music]

26:52.698 --> 26:54.613
- [Richie] Out of that.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.703
- [Becca] Yeah.

26:57.746 --> 26:58.704
- Makes sense.

26:59.748 --> 27:00.967
Being born and all,

27:01.010 --> 27:02.664
that's why it looks
like a vagina, right?

27:02.708 --> 27:04.579
- It looks more like
an asshole to me.

27:08.583 --> 27:09.802
- Did you know that
Salvador Dalí had a brother

27:09.845 --> 27:11.412
who died before he was born?

27:12.631 --> 27:14.676
Whose name was
also Salvador Dalí.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.766
His parents were convinced

27:17.810 --> 27:20.421
that he was a reincarnation
of his older brother.

27:20.464 --> 27:23.598
I mean, Salvador one
died exactly nine months

27:23.642 --> 27:25.556
before Salvador two was born.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.125
He claimed he spent his
entire life trying to step out

27:29.169 --> 27:31.345
of the shadow of
the other Salvador,

27:31.388 --> 27:33.086
to purge him from his life

27:33.129 --> 27:35.044
so he could become
his one, true self.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.266
Totally makes sense to me now.

27:40.963 --> 27:43.052
- He also wore a
lobster for a hat.

27:44.227 --> 27:47.448
Maybe he was just
crazy for crazy's sake.

27:47.491 --> 27:49.232
[Richie laughs]

27:49.276 --> 27:50.320
- Yeah, maybe.

27:51.539 --> 27:53.323
- You know the saying,

27:53.367 --> 27:55.543
repeating the same patterns

27:55.586 --> 27:57.632
and expecting
different results...

27:59.199 --> 28:01.549
[somber music]

28:01.592 --> 28:03.551
You've done this a
few times now, right?

28:05.901 --> 28:07.033
You keep coming back.

28:08.730 --> 28:09.818
Nothing changes.

28:12.342 --> 28:13.996
So what if you just stopped?

28:15.955 --> 28:18.609
Accept the results as
they present themselves.

28:19.567 --> 28:22.265
You don't have to step out
from behind anyone's shadow.

28:23.179 --> 28:26.443
- [Richie] Hm, I don't
know, then what's the point?

28:28.141 --> 28:30.665
- Maybe the point is that
you're supposed to live.

28:33.059 --> 28:34.669
Maybe you keep coming back,

28:36.192 --> 28:37.933
because you're
supposed to be here.

28:39.456 --> 28:42.111
[ominous music]

28:51.164 --> 28:53.732
[Becca groans]

29:04.220 --> 29:07.006
[paper crinkling]

29:07.049 --> 29:10.444
- I have really exhausted
ways to kill myself.

29:13.316 --> 29:14.578
Well, all the clean ways.

29:18.017 --> 29:20.759
[pen scratching]

29:26.808 --> 29:30.420
It's starting to get
kind of ripe in here.

29:30.464 --> 29:31.334
[Becca sniffing]

29:31.378 --> 29:34.294
- Fuck, Matt called the super!

29:34.337 --> 29:36.513
- [Richie] Okay, so?

29:36.557 --> 29:37.427
- So?

29:37.471 --> 29:38.733
He's gonna come in the morning.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.649
- Great, he can fix
the wall in my bedroom.

29:41.692 --> 29:44.304
- Richie?
- Right, he can't fix that.

29:44.347 --> 29:46.001
'Cause what if I
accidentally kill myself,

29:46.045 --> 29:47.394
we don't want to seal that off.

29:48.308 --> 29:51.267
- No, the bodies, Richie.

29:51.311 --> 29:52.921
If he shows up he's definitely
not gonna see this the way

29:52.965 --> 29:54.488
that you see it.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.620
The way that you and I see it.

29:56.664 --> 29:57.970
And he's not gonna
let us explain either.

29:58.013 --> 29:59.928
He'll call the cops and
they'll take you away.

29:59.972 --> 30:01.364
- Take us away.

30:01.408 --> 30:03.584
How are they gonna know
you're not an accomplice?

30:04.933 --> 30:06.587
- Will you stop making jokes?

30:08.589 --> 30:09.982
Can you at least look at me?

30:13.115 --> 30:13.986
- Okay, sorry.

30:15.770 --> 30:16.597
So what do we do?

30:21.123 --> 30:21.950
[dramatic music]

30:21.994 --> 30:23.299
- There's only four, right?

30:23.343 --> 30:24.692
- Let's see.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.825
There's electrocution in
the bathtub. [gasping]

30:26.868 --> 30:28.565
Hanging in the closet.

30:28.609 --> 30:30.437
Suffocation in the kitchen.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.265
- OD'd on the couch.

30:32.308 --> 30:33.701
[Richie farting]
[Becca gasping]

30:33.744 --> 30:36.051
- So that's four, which
makes me lucky number five.

30:36.965 --> 30:39.576
So we need four
barrels and some acid

30:39.620 --> 30:40.795
or something like that.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.841
- Yeah, Richie, do
you have four barrels

30:42.884 --> 30:44.233
and that much sulfuric acid?

30:45.756 --> 30:47.933
- [sighs] No, I don't.

30:47.976 --> 30:49.108
Do you?

30:49.151 --> 30:51.545
- No, no, I don't.

30:51.588 --> 30:53.199
[dramatic music]

30:53.242 --> 30:55.331
Do you have Dad's old toolbox?

30:56.332 --> 30:57.290
- Yeah, I think so.

31:04.906 --> 31:07.561
[Richie groans]

31:30.410 --> 31:31.237
I'm good.

31:32.151 --> 31:33.282
- It's the only way.

31:33.326 --> 31:34.240
- I've never hacked
up a body before,

31:34.283 --> 31:35.545
let alone my own body.

31:35.589 --> 31:36.416
Don't you do this kind
of thing all the time?

31:36.459 --> 31:37.896
- No!

31:37.939 --> 31:39.854
- Okay, I've heard you talk
about dissecting bodies.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.900
- Okay, I have done it, but
I don't do it all the time.

31:41.943 --> 31:42.901
It's not like a hobby.

31:42.944 --> 31:43.945
- Tomato, tomahto.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.862
This is gonna get messy.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.211
- Do you have any garbage bags?

31:57.916 --> 31:58.699
- Is it flipped?

32:02.964 --> 32:03.791
- Yeah.

32:04.879 --> 32:06.837
[electricity sizzling]

32:06.881 --> 32:08.535
[Matt gasping]

32:08.578 --> 32:13.366
- Don't let it distract
you, push it. [grunts]

32:13.409 --> 32:14.236
Push it!

32:15.498 --> 32:17.979
- Jesus Christ,
Richie, turn it off!

32:18.023 --> 32:18.893
- [Richie] Sorry!

32:20.764 --> 32:22.027
[switch clicking]

32:22.070 --> 32:24.812
- 35, you look so young.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.118
- It's off, right?

32:26.161 --> 32:27.032
- Yeah, it's off.

32:30.122 --> 32:32.994
[water dripping]

32:33.038 --> 32:34.300
Do you think it will still work?

32:34.343 --> 32:37.825
- [gasps] Don't creep
up on me ever again.

32:38.739 --> 32:40.262
Okay?
- Okay, sorry.

32:42.917 --> 32:47.052
But do you think it will
still work, the toaster?

32:51.099 --> 32:52.013
[Richie gags]

32:52.057 --> 32:52.883
Oh, oh.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.539
- Don't you dare throw up.

32:56.583 --> 32:59.238
- I won't, I won't,
I'm good, I'm good.

33:00.761 --> 33:01.588
I'm good.

33:04.591 --> 33:06.549
I can do this.

33:06.593 --> 33:07.420
I can do this.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.861
[Richie gagging]

33:13.904 --> 33:18.866
I can, I can do this. [coughing]

33:27.092 --> 33:29.659
[saw scraping]

33:40.235 --> 33:42.846
[saw scraping]

33:51.507 --> 33:56.469
It's pretty fucked
up, huh? [laughing]

33:56.512 --> 33:57.557
- Please don't.

34:21.710 --> 34:25.541
- You have something,
never mind.

34:28.543 --> 34:30.024
- Do you have any more bags?
- Yes.

34:34.985 --> 34:36.726
[foot thuds]

34:36.770 --> 34:38.685
Shit, Becca, I knocked
over your purse.

34:38.728 --> 34:40.208
- Just leave it.

34:40.252 --> 34:41.514
We'll deal with it later.

34:51.697 --> 34:53.264
What's taking so long?

34:58.966 --> 35:00.359
[somber music]

35:00.402 --> 35:02.404
- What the hell is this?

35:04.145 --> 35:05.668
- My acceptance letter.

35:05.712 --> 35:06.974
- Obviously, for what?

35:08.062 --> 35:09.281
- School.

35:09.324 --> 35:10.151
- Obviously!

35:11.935 --> 35:13.502
- I wanted to tell you about it.

35:14.982 --> 35:18.203
That's why I called earlierand said that I wanted to talk.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.118
- Yeah, well I must
have fried my phone

35:20.161 --> 35:21.641
when I electrocuted myself.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.775
You got this last month.

35:27.429 --> 35:28.822
When were you gonna tell me?

35:30.780 --> 35:31.607
- Today.

35:32.695 --> 35:33.827
I was waiting for
the right time,

35:33.870 --> 35:37.135
but it wasn't the right time.

35:41.748 --> 35:43.141
- [Richie] When did you apply?

35:45.186 --> 35:46.796
- It doesn't matter.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.058
- It doesn't matter?

35:48.102 --> 35:49.756
Obviously this matters, Becca,

35:49.799 --> 35:51.149
why would you not tell me this?

35:51.192 --> 35:52.672
- 'Cause I'm not going.

35:52.715 --> 35:54.848
Okay, I'm not gonna go!

35:54.891 --> 35:56.632
- And why not?
- Why not?

35:56.676 --> 35:57.807
Why do you think?

35:57.851 --> 35:59.722
You think I can move
across the country

35:59.766 --> 36:02.203
when stuff like this
is always happening?

36:02.247 --> 36:03.465
- Really, stuff like this?

36:03.509 --> 36:05.685
- Yeah, well, I mean
not exactly like this,

36:05.728 --> 36:07.295
but there's always something!

36:07.339 --> 36:09.210
There's always some kind ofcrisis with you that I need to--

36:09.254 --> 36:12.082
- What, say it.

36:12.126 --> 36:13.649
- That I need to save you from.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.786
- I'm not a child.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.876
Who looked after
you when mom died,

36:22.919 --> 36:24.704
because it sure as
hell wasn't dad.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.184
- You were supposed
to look after me,

36:26.227 --> 36:27.663
you were my older brother.

36:27.707 --> 36:30.318
- I did, when he was outdrinkin' himself fucking stupid,

36:30.362 --> 36:31.798
I was there watching over you!

36:31.841 --> 36:32.625
Do you remember that!

36:32.668 --> 36:33.843
That was me!

36:33.887 --> 36:35.454
- Yeah, well a lot's
changed since then.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.762
- What's that supposed to mean?

36:41.416 --> 36:43.418
- Forget it, it doesn't matter.

36:48.597 --> 36:51.078
- I didn't ask to be like this.

36:51.121 --> 36:53.689
I didn't ask for
the mood swings.

36:53.733 --> 36:56.475
I didn't ask for the
paralyzing depression.

36:56.518 --> 36:58.303
I didn't ask for the anger.

36:58.346 --> 37:02.742
I didn't ask for the constant
thoughts of killing myself.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.709
[Richie sniffing]

37:18.453 --> 37:22.805
And you come in here
and you're lying to me.

37:22.849 --> 37:25.417
And you look at me
like I'm insane.

37:26.896 --> 37:30.378
People have been
looking at me like that

37:30.422 --> 37:33.903
for my entire life. [sniffing]

37:36.166 --> 37:37.342
I didn't think you would.

37:40.258 --> 37:45.263
You were the one person
who did not look at me

37:45.611 --> 37:49.049
like I was a fucking
freak. [groans]

37:52.792 --> 37:55.316
- It's okay, it's
okay, I'm sorry.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.105
It's been a really long night.

38:04.586 --> 38:07.241
I want to talk about
this and we will.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.896
But we have other things
to deal with first, okay.

38:11.245 --> 38:13.639
Now why don't you
take a little break.

38:15.554 --> 38:17.730
And I'll deal with
this right now.

38:19.862 --> 38:20.689
Okay.

38:23.257 --> 38:25.825
[gentle music]

38:38.141 --> 38:40.709
[saw scraping]

38:56.334 --> 38:59.075
[Becca groaning]

39:04.211 --> 39:06.692
[Becca sighs]

39:09.172 --> 39:11.914
[Becca groaning]

39:17.137 --> 39:18.007
- What?

39:18.051 --> 39:19.313
- Where's the other body?

39:23.491 --> 39:24.362
- What!

39:27.626 --> 39:28.888
- Where's the other body?

39:41.291 --> 39:44.033
[Becca groaning]

39:46.993 --> 39:51.998
[bag rustling]
[somber music]

40:04.924 --> 40:06.012
Don't get up.

40:14.237 --> 40:15.804
[door thuds]

40:15.848 --> 40:16.675
Oh, shit.

40:41.264 --> 40:43.963
[Becca groaning]

40:55.409 --> 40:57.977
[Becca grunts]

41:24.438 --> 41:27.354
[doorbell buzzing]

41:33.229 --> 41:38.234
[dramatic music]
[doorbell buzzing]

41:47.983 --> 41:50.508
[Becca sighs]

41:59.342 --> 42:01.344
[doorbell buzzing]

42:01.388 --> 42:02.432
- [Matt] Yes, who is it?

42:02.476 --> 42:05.000
- Hey, it's Becca.

42:05.958 --> 42:08.395
- [Matt] [sighs] Are
you fucking serious?

42:08.438 --> 42:09.570
- Yeah, I got locked out.

42:09.614 --> 42:10.876
I'm really sorry.

42:11.833 --> 42:14.706
I tried buzzing Richie but
he has his headphones on

42:14.749 --> 42:15.881
because we were trying

42:15.924 --> 42:17.230
to keep the noise
down and everything.

42:17.273 --> 42:19.145
And I forgot the cinder block--

42:19.188 --> 42:20.538
- [Matt] Enough!

42:23.366 --> 42:24.150
[door buzzing]

42:24.193 --> 42:25.020
- Thank you.

42:32.637 --> 42:33.463
Sorry.

42:50.176 --> 42:52.874
[somber music]

42:52.918 --> 42:55.355
[door thuds]

43:00.969 --> 43:02.797
- If it's not one of you
makin' a bunch of noise,

43:02.841 --> 43:03.711
it's the other.

43:05.060 --> 43:07.323
You know, every single squeak
you make back here echoes

43:07.367 --> 43:09.282
through the entire building.

43:09.325 --> 43:11.763
- Look, Matt, I know
we've been a total pain

43:11.806 --> 43:12.764
in your ass tonight.

43:12.807 --> 43:14.504
There's just a lot going on.

43:15.767 --> 43:19.466
And I know it's no
excuse, I understand.

43:20.641 --> 43:23.557
I can only imagine what it mustbe like to be his neighbour.

43:36.439 --> 43:38.006
- Hold up.
- No.

43:38.050 --> 43:39.791
No, no, no, it's, I--

43:39.834 --> 43:41.880
- Oh Jesus, whose
body you got in here?

43:44.491 --> 43:45.927
Just so you know,

43:45.971 --> 43:46.841
I don't like having to be
the bad guy all the time.

43:46.885 --> 43:50.584
- Yeah, I know the feeling.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.760
- I'm sure you do.

43:52.804 --> 43:55.241
- Yeah, well sometimes it
can be a little overwhelming

43:55.284 --> 43:58.461
but I guess that's what
family's all about, right?

43:58.505 --> 44:00.028
You can't live with 'em,

44:00.072 --> 44:03.684
you can't chop 'em up and
throw 'em out with the trash.

44:03.728 --> 44:04.990
- Listen, it's not my place

44:05.033 --> 44:07.253
but at some point
you're gonna have

44:07.296 --> 44:09.298
to let him clean
up his own mess.

44:09.342 --> 44:11.997
I'm sure you have
better things to do.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.651
- Yeah, you'd be surprised.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.829
For a while I thought that
things would be different.

44:17.872 --> 44:21.615
But, he needs me,

44:21.659 --> 44:23.530
so here I am.

44:25.271 --> 44:27.839
- [Matt] Why isn't he here
helping you out for a change?

44:27.882 --> 44:29.101
- Well, I don't
know if you know,

44:29.144 --> 44:31.538
but Richie has some
mental health issues.

44:31.581 --> 44:32.844
- [laughs] You don't say.

44:35.107 --> 44:36.108
[gentle music]

44:36.151 --> 44:38.110
Okay, well, just
bend at your knee

44:38.153 --> 44:40.329
and lift with your legs,
not with your back.

44:41.722 --> 44:42.549
Come on.

44:49.077 --> 44:51.732
[both groaning]

44:58.783 --> 45:00.088
- Ah, thank you.

45:02.743 --> 45:03.657
- Anytime.

45:05.398 --> 45:08.183
[both groaning]

45:08.227 --> 45:09.619
That was the last time.

45:21.631 --> 45:23.329
- Hey, thanks.

45:24.286 --> 45:26.854
- Anytime [laughs], no.

45:28.813 --> 45:29.683
Good night.

45:30.989 --> 45:31.990
Keep it quiet, okay?

46:07.199 --> 46:09.723
[tense music]

46:15.337 --> 46:18.123
[ominous humming]

46:33.878 --> 46:35.140
- Hey, listen--

46:35.183 --> 46:38.012
- Please, just, can you
give me five minutes?

46:38.056 --> 46:39.622
I just, I need a break.

46:40.885 --> 46:41.711
- Sure.

46:58.250 --> 47:00.992
[dramatic music]

47:24.711 --> 47:27.540
- Jesus Christ,
Richie, the music!

47:38.768 --> 47:40.074
- Finally, you're awake.

47:40.118 --> 47:42.511
- [Becca] All I
wanted was five minutes.

47:42.555 --> 47:45.384
- That was more
than five minutes.

47:45.427 --> 47:49.301
- [groans] So I fell
asleep, so what.

47:50.563 --> 47:54.393
Mm, maybe we should
order pizza or something.

47:55.742 --> 47:57.135
Why are you acting so weird?

47:58.136 --> 48:00.486
- Becca--
[knocking at the door]

48:00.529 --> 48:03.489
- Shit, what did I say
about the goddam music!

48:03.532 --> 48:04.533
- Becca, wait.

48:04.577 --> 48:05.360
[fist banging]

48:05.404 --> 48:07.362
- What the fuck is that?

48:07.406 --> 48:09.364
- I was tryin' somethin' out.

48:09.408 --> 48:10.235
- Oh, God.

48:11.584 --> 48:12.411
- Becca!

48:13.325 --> 48:15.283
I have had it with you!

48:15.327 --> 48:17.155
I've been more than patient.

48:17.198 --> 48:20.158
You sucker me in with your
sad girl song and dance.

48:20.201 --> 48:22.334
Like a chump I fall for it.

48:22.377 --> 48:24.118
Well no more, okay!

48:24.162 --> 48:25.685
I'm callin' the cops.

48:25.728 --> 48:26.599
- He's gonna call the cops.

48:26.642 --> 48:28.993
- Don't open it!
- I have to!

48:31.125 --> 48:32.474
Hey, Matt, how's it going?

48:32.518 --> 48:33.867
- Bad, Dick, what do you think?

48:33.911 --> 48:35.956
It's the middle of the
night and I'm still awake.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.349
- Yeah, I'm sorry
about the music,

48:37.392 --> 48:39.786
I'm just clearing my head.

48:39.829 --> 48:41.614
- Oh, yeah, well you can't
do this to people, okay?

48:41.657 --> 48:42.441
I have rights.

48:42.484 --> 48:43.355
- We're so sorry.

48:43.398 --> 48:44.399
I told him to keep it down.

48:44.443 --> 48:45.879
- Oh, well that solves it then

48:45.923 --> 48:47.620
because this one gives two shitswhat you tell him, huh?

48:47.663 --> 48:49.056
- [Becca] Okay, you
know, the music's off,

48:49.100 --> 48:51.232
it won't be going on
again, it's all right.

48:51.276 --> 48:52.755
So, just go back
to your apartment.

48:52.799 --> 48:53.887
- What do you
think you're doing?

48:53.931 --> 48:55.976
Don't you dare close
the door on me.

48:56.020 --> 48:57.412
- Hey, get out of here!

48:57.456 --> 48:58.283
- Okay.

49:00.198 --> 49:01.025
- Ow.

49:01.068 --> 49:02.156
- Smells like death in here.

49:03.244 --> 49:04.942
I don't know what I expected
from the likes of you two.

49:04.985 --> 49:07.422
There's paint everywhere,
this place is a pigsty.

49:08.728 --> 49:10.208
What the hell is that?

49:10.251 --> 49:12.601
- [Becca] It's not
what it looks like.

49:12.645 --> 49:15.343
[dramatic music]

49:16.518 --> 49:17.345
- You made this?

49:25.353 --> 49:26.659
Holy shit!

49:26.702 --> 49:29.053
Holy fuckin'...you stay
the fuck away from me.

49:30.228 --> 49:31.925
Holy fuckin' shit!

49:31.969 --> 49:33.579
Hey, you get away from me.

49:33.622 --> 49:35.929
Jesus Christ, you are
fuckin' psychopaths.

49:35.973 --> 49:37.800
I knew it, I knew it.

49:37.844 --> 49:39.541
Oh, oh my God.

49:39.585 --> 49:40.890
- Matt, no, please.

49:40.934 --> 49:42.414
- You shut your mouth.
- Please, we can explain.

49:42.457 --> 49:44.720
- Explain it to the
cops, missy, okay.

49:44.764 --> 49:45.939
Step away from me.

49:45.983 --> 49:47.854
Stay the fuck away from me.

49:47.897 --> 49:49.073
- Please, please don't.

49:51.075 --> 49:54.295
[Richie laughing]
[dramatic music]

49:54.339 --> 49:56.080
- You son of a bitch!

49:56.123 --> 49:58.038
- If you'd just stop
and listen for a minute.

49:58.082 --> 49:59.692
- I just got this phone.

49:59.735 --> 50:01.433
You know how much this cost?

50:01.476 --> 50:03.609
More than your life.
- Don't!

50:03.652 --> 50:05.002
- Oh, I dare you!

50:05.959 --> 50:07.917
[blow thuds]
[Matt groans]

50:07.961 --> 50:09.223
[Becca gasping]
[Richie laughing]

50:09.267 --> 50:10.572
- Why would you do that?

50:10.616 --> 50:12.096
- He was gonna call the cops.

50:16.187 --> 50:17.579
- With what?

50:17.623 --> 50:19.451
Dammit, Richie, you keep
making everything harder.

50:19.494 --> 50:22.367
Why couldn't you just
listen to me for once?

50:22.410 --> 50:23.803
- I don't think
that's very fair.

50:23.846 --> 50:25.935
- And what were you
doing with that arm?

50:25.979 --> 50:27.067
- Well, I found
it in the bathroom

50:27.111 --> 50:29.678
so I just started
painting with it.

50:29.722 --> 50:32.420
I mean, come on, how fuckin'
avant-garde is that, right?

50:32.464 --> 50:34.988
- [groaning] You left
evidence in the living room.

50:35.032 --> 50:35.815
- What evidence?

50:35.858 --> 50:36.946
I am alive.

50:36.990 --> 50:39.079
- No one's gonna
think that's your arm.

50:39.123 --> 50:40.428
- It's an exact copy.

50:41.299 --> 50:42.952
[Becca sighs]

50:42.996 --> 50:44.780
- We've been through this.

50:44.824 --> 50:47.653
Your arm is attached
to your body, Richie.

50:47.696 --> 50:50.351
That one, it's not, remember?

50:50.395 --> 50:52.571
- Yeah, okay, okay, right.

50:54.747 --> 50:56.966
Duh, wait.

50:57.010 --> 50:58.229
Why don't we just kill him?

50:58.272 --> 51:00.013
- We're not killing anyone.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.188
- Just listen to me.
- No.

51:01.232 --> 51:02.624
- If we kill him--
- Richie.

51:02.668 --> 51:04.409
We are not killing him.

51:04.452 --> 51:06.846
- Hear me out, all right,
just give me a second.

51:12.417 --> 51:13.896
Lift him up.

51:13.940 --> 51:17.987
Lift him up, come on.
[Becca groaning]

51:18.031 --> 51:20.773
[dramatic music]

51:23.993 --> 51:26.605
[ominous humming]

51:26.648 --> 51:28.476
- You do realize this
is kidnapping, right?

51:28.520 --> 51:29.651
- It doesn't matter.

51:29.695 --> 51:30.739
None of it matters.

51:30.783 --> 51:32.611
It's gonna be like
a dream, right?

51:32.654 --> 51:34.221
If we kill him.

51:35.527 --> 51:36.354
- No.

51:38.573 --> 51:40.009
- He'll die here,

51:40.053 --> 51:42.011
then another him's
gonna come out of there

51:42.055 --> 51:44.101
and it'll be like
it never happened.

51:44.144 --> 51:45.232
- How do you know that?

51:45.276 --> 51:46.451
- Just trust me,
it all makes sense.

51:46.494 --> 51:47.626
- No, it doesn't make sense.

51:47.669 --> 51:48.801
None of it makes sense.

51:48.844 --> 51:50.107
[Richie sighs]

51:50.150 --> 51:51.499
You keep coming back but
how do you know that--

51:51.543 --> 51:53.588
- Everyone comes back, Becca!

51:56.200 --> 51:58.463
Listen, I didn't want you to
get caught up in this, okay.

51:58.506 --> 52:00.769
But I needed someone and you
are the only one I trust.

52:00.813 --> 52:05.122
- Oh, boohoo. I need you,

52:05.165 --> 52:05.992
you're the only one I trust.

52:06.035 --> 52:08.560
Give me a fuckin' break.

52:08.603 --> 52:11.737
Hey, Dick, she's
always helping you.

52:11.780 --> 52:13.042
I see her here all the time,

52:13.086 --> 52:14.435
she's cleaning up after you,

52:14.479 --> 52:16.872
taking out your garbage,
getting you groceries.

52:17.743 --> 52:20.180
Maybe if you stopped staring
at yourself all damn day,

52:20.224 --> 52:22.008
you'd see how much
she does for you.

52:23.401 --> 52:24.663
- Well.

52:24.706 --> 52:26.055
- You're no better, missy.

52:26.099 --> 52:28.667
Oh, I'm too scared to tell
him how I really feel.

52:28.710 --> 52:30.016
Can't live my own life,

52:30.059 --> 52:33.106
so I guess I'll just
die up here on my cross.

52:33.150 --> 52:34.803
You both suck.

52:34.847 --> 52:36.022
- Well, fuck you, Matt.

52:36.065 --> 52:37.197
- Yeah, fuck you, Matt.

52:37.241 --> 52:38.503
- Fuck me?

52:38.546 --> 52:41.114
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

52:41.158 --> 52:42.811
Why don't you just put a sock
in his mouth or something.

52:42.855 --> 52:43.682
- Is that true?

52:44.857 --> 52:46.424
- No, I mean.

52:46.467 --> 52:48.469
- I don't want you to
be afraid to talk to me.

52:48.513 --> 52:50.471
- Richie, I'm not, it's just.

52:51.603 --> 52:53.170
I'm not, I want to be
able to talk to you.

52:53.213 --> 52:54.606
I want to be able
to tell you things.

52:54.649 --> 52:57.174
- [Richie] Yeah, you should,
I mean, we're siblings,

52:57.217 --> 52:58.262
we should be able to
talk about anything.

52:58.305 --> 52:59.785
- [Becca] I can
trust you, I know,

52:59.828 --> 53:02.701
it's just, it's hard, you know.

53:02.744 --> 53:03.963
- You're goin' to
fuckin' jail, idiots.

53:04.006 --> 53:05.138
- Will you shut up.

53:05.921 --> 53:07.445
- I don't know who
taught you to tie a knot,

53:07.488 --> 53:09.229
but you can add that to the
list of things you suck at.

53:09.273 --> 53:11.144
- See, we should
have just killed him.

53:11.188 --> 53:12.014
- We're not killing anybody.

53:12.058 --> 53:13.712
- You're not killing me.

53:13.755 --> 53:15.192
'Cause you're already dead.

53:16.105 --> 53:18.630
[electricity sizzling]
[Matt groaning]

53:18.673 --> 53:21.110
[body thuds]

53:22.895 --> 53:25.637
- [Becca] Matt, Matt! [groaning]

53:25.680 --> 53:26.681
- [Richie] What are you doing?

53:26.725 --> 53:28.379
- [Becca] What
does it look like?

53:28.422 --> 53:29.684
Matt!

53:29.728 --> 53:30.990
Call 911.

53:31.033 --> 53:31.817
- [Richie] Why would I do that?

53:31.860 --> 53:32.774
Just let him die.

53:32.818 --> 53:33.732
- [Becca] Now!

53:34.602 --> 53:35.386
[ominous whooshing]

53:35.429 --> 53:36.561
- See, it's happening.

53:36.604 --> 53:38.650
You're wasting your
time, he's dead.

53:38.693 --> 53:40.782
[fluid squelching]

53:40.826 --> 53:41.653
See!

53:43.132 --> 53:43.959
I told you.

53:45.265 --> 53:48.442
[fluid squelching]

53:48.486 --> 53:49.922
Stop.

53:49.965 --> 53:51.750
He's dead, you're
wasting your time.

53:52.925 --> 53:54.143
- No.

53:54.187 --> 53:55.275
- We'll switch his clothes.

53:55.319 --> 53:56.450
He won't notice the difference

53:56.494 --> 53:57.495
and it'll be like
it never happened.

53:57.538 --> 53:59.410
- I can't.

53:59.453 --> 54:01.499
- [Richie] Sure
you can, it's easy.

54:01.542 --> 54:02.674
It does not matter.

54:02.717 --> 54:04.545
- No, it does matter, Richie!

54:05.503 --> 54:07.983
These things, they matter.

54:09.376 --> 54:10.551
[Richie sighs]

54:10.595 --> 54:12.510
You keep acting like
nothing's happened.

54:14.425 --> 54:15.382
But I can't.

54:17.341 --> 54:21.127
I carry all of this
shit all the time.

54:22.476 --> 54:23.651
You don't.

54:24.478 --> 54:25.653
You don't care.

54:28.047 --> 54:30.615
[somber music]

54:33.444 --> 54:37.926
I thought you were dead,
back in that hospital.

54:37.970 --> 54:38.971
You remember that?

54:40.320 --> 54:41.365
You were dead.

54:42.366 --> 54:43.584
And then you weren't.

54:45.499 --> 54:49.982
And I thought, why
couldn't he have just died?

54:52.376 --> 54:55.161
Everything would have
been so much easier.

54:58.686 --> 55:01.341
[Becca sobbing]

55:08.000 --> 55:09.436
- Becca, don't think
you need [gasps]--

55:09.480 --> 55:12.309
[Matt gasping]

55:12.352 --> 55:15.050
- [Becca] Oh, oh, okay.

55:15.094 --> 55:16.704
Don't move, don't
move, shh, shh.

55:16.748 --> 55:18.837
- What happened?
- There's been accident.

55:18.880 --> 55:20.055
It's okay.
- It's gone.

55:20.099 --> 55:21.579
- [Matt] What did you do to me?

55:21.622 --> 55:24.930
- Come on, hey, hey,
everything's okay.

55:25.800 --> 55:26.584
[Matt groaning]

55:26.627 --> 55:27.454
- [Richie] Becca.

55:29.674 --> 55:30.849
- You're okay.

55:31.937 --> 55:32.764
- Becca!

55:33.678 --> 55:34.592
- Shh, what?

55:36.376 --> 55:37.769
Hey, you're okay.

55:42.426 --> 55:43.775
Just, just stay there.

55:45.994 --> 55:48.388
- It's gone, where'd it go?

55:49.824 --> 55:50.999
- I don't know.

55:51.043 --> 55:53.001
He's alive, so maybe
it just disappeared.

55:54.046 --> 55:56.744
Okay, get your stuff,
we're going to the hospital

55:56.788 --> 55:57.963
and I'm not leaving
you alone in here.

55:58.006 --> 55:59.356
- No, we can't go to
the hospital, Becca,

55:59.399 --> 56:01.096
because we cannot go--

56:01.140 --> 56:04.273
[Matt screaming]
[ominous music]

56:04.317 --> 56:05.536
- What the hell is, holy fuck!

56:06.928 --> 56:11.933
[monster screaming]
[Becca screaming]

56:12.586 --> 56:14.022
- Don't leave me!

56:17.156 --> 56:20.420
You assholes!
[Richie gasping]

[tense music]

57:52.338 --> 57:54.862
[Becca gasping]

57:54.906 --> 57:55.733
Oh shit.

57:57.691 --> 57:58.736
He killed that thing.

58:01.216 --> 58:02.043
- Huh?

58:05.351 --> 58:08.702
- If he got out, we
are in so much trouble.

58:08.746 --> 58:09.921
- That's impossible, you can't--

58:09.964 --> 58:12.532
[Matt gasping]

58:25.850 --> 58:29.201
Dude, that was badass, man,

58:29.244 --> 58:30.942
you crushed that
thing's head in!

58:32.073 --> 58:33.292
All right, listen,

58:33.335 --> 58:34.859
I know this is gonna be
a little overwhelming,

58:34.902 --> 58:36.164
but we can explain everything.

58:36.208 --> 58:37.775
- Richie?

58:37.818 --> 58:38.732
- Hey guys.

58:38.776 --> 58:39.603
- Holy shit!

58:40.560 --> 58:42.867
[men grunting]

58:42.910 --> 58:44.172
Don't touch me!

58:45.304 --> 58:49.482

- Richie!

58:49.526 --> 58:52.180
[men groaning]

58:52.224 --> 58:54.792
- I'm sorry about the music!

[men yelling]

58:57.664 --> 59:01.059
[screaming] Help, Becca!

59:01.102 --> 59:03.017
Becca, help me, Becca!

59:03.061 --> 59:03.888
Becca!

59:05.106 --> 59:06.281
Fuck!

59:06.325 --> 59:07.413
Go, go, go!

59:07.456 --> 59:12.200
[Becca screaming]
[flesh squelching]

59:14.551 --> 59:17.205
[Becca gasping]

59:32.220 --> 59:33.874
- It's fine, it's fine.

59:35.397 --> 59:37.312
He'll come back and we'll
just explain everything to him

59:37.356 --> 59:41.882
so that we avoid, you
know, all of this.

59:44.276 --> 59:45.582
- What happened?

59:47.758 --> 59:50.761
- He came through, but the
old him was still alive,

59:50.804 --> 59:53.590
so I think something must
have gotten corrupted.

59:55.896 --> 59:58.725
They're both dead
now, so. [gasping]

01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:05.471
Maybe we should clear
him out, you know,

01:00:05.514 --> 01:00:07.125
before he comes back.

01:00:07.168 --> 01:00:08.605
Might be a bit of a shocker.

01:00:11.129 --> 01:00:14.132
[tense music]

01:00:14.175 --> 01:00:16.264
All right, grab his legs.

01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:23.837
[Becca gasping]

01:00:25.186 --> 01:00:27.319
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

01:00:27.362 --> 01:00:29.060
- Why isn't it coming out?

01:00:29.103 --> 01:00:31.149
- I don't know.

01:00:31.192 --> 01:00:33.847
[Becca gasping]

01:00:46.599 --> 01:00:48.122
This has never happened before.

01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:49.646
Obviously, I'm still here.

01:00:53.824 --> 01:00:55.608
- Is there anything
in there about me?

01:00:58.567 --> 01:00:59.612
- Why would there be something--

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:03.268
- Stop, I found
it, in the closet.

01:01:07.925 --> 01:01:10.362
- [sighs] I was trying
to tell you, it's just--

01:01:10.405 --> 01:01:11.276
- [Becca] What did you do?

01:01:11.319 --> 01:01:12.712
- I didn't do anything, Becca.

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.975
But you just need to listen.

01:01:15.019 --> 01:01:18.065
Becca, okay, I just, you,

01:01:22.417 --> 01:01:25.072
it was this.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.904
I made it for me, this
is what I drank earlier.

01:01:32.427 --> 01:01:34.734
[Becca groans]

01:01:34.778 --> 01:01:37.955
[tape rewinding]

01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:40.697
- Did I come out of
that fucking wall?

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.263
- At first I thought
that you were asleep.

01:01:42.307 --> 01:01:43.656
And then it started happening.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.223
So I took your clothes and
I put you in the closet.

01:01:45.266 --> 01:01:46.877
I just, I panicked.

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.748
- You stuffed my
body into a closet

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.097
and you didn't even
tell me, Richie.

01:01:50.141 --> 01:01:52.143
- So what, okay, this is
you, this is still you.

01:01:52.186 --> 01:01:53.274
What's the big deal?

01:01:53.318 --> 01:01:54.754
- What's the big deal?

01:01:54.798 --> 01:01:57.278
- We spent the night
cutting up my bodies

01:01:57.322 --> 01:01:58.802
and dumping them in the garbage.

01:01:58.845 --> 01:02:00.151
All of those me's.

01:02:00.194 --> 01:02:01.718
Who gives a shit?

01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:02.893
I'm still here.

01:02:07.288 --> 01:02:09.943
[Becca sighing]

01:02:11.249 --> 01:02:12.424
Becca, where are you going?

01:02:12.467 --> 01:02:13.860
- No, I am done helping you.

01:02:13.904 --> 01:02:15.166
- Becca, don't.

01:02:16.428 --> 01:02:19.170
[dramatic music]

01:02:20.867 --> 01:02:23.565
[Becca moaning]

01:02:24.871 --> 01:02:26.960
- You can't leave!

01:02:27.004 --> 01:02:28.440
And neither can I, okay.

01:02:28.483 --> 01:02:32.618
When it happens,
you're just stuck.

01:02:35.664 --> 01:02:37.057
I figured that out early on.

01:02:40.713 --> 01:02:41.932
- You piece of shit.

01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:44.282
[hand slaps]

01:02:44.325 --> 01:02:49.330
[Becca sobbing]
[somber music]

01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:07.147
[range clicking]

01:04:17.723 --> 01:04:19.464
- [Richie] Becca, I--

01:04:19.507 --> 01:04:22.119
- It's not like I was ever
getting out anyway, right?

01:04:26.123 --> 01:04:28.734
[somber music]

01:04:42.661 --> 01:04:43.749
You know, Mom was
supposed to take me

01:04:43.792 --> 01:04:46.012
to the Oceanarium
in Hampton Beach.

01:04:49.363 --> 01:04:54.368
And then you got
sick, so we didn't go.

01:04:58.242 --> 01:05:00.331
I came home and stayed
with you all night.

01:05:09.514 --> 01:05:12.604
That was the last
time we were there.

01:05:14.084 --> 01:05:15.824
We never went back
after she died.

01:05:27.227 --> 01:05:29.882
And then after you threw
up on Darryl at my prom,

01:05:31.318 --> 01:05:32.624
everybody ditched me.

01:05:37.498 --> 01:05:40.719
So I left early and came
home to check on you.

01:05:49.728 --> 01:05:54.341
When I got that
acceptance letter,

01:05:54.385 --> 01:05:56.735
I couldn't believe I got in.

01:06:11.793 --> 01:06:13.534
I don't even know why I applied.

01:06:19.018 --> 01:06:23.936
It's like I was pretending my
life could be something else.

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:28.375
I lied to myself.

01:06:31.813 --> 01:06:32.684
And I lied to you.

01:06:46.089 --> 01:06:47.090
Matt was right.

01:06:51.616 --> 01:06:53.183
We really do deserve each other.

01:06:55.185 --> 01:06:56.099
Look at us.

01:07:09.199 --> 01:07:11.070
Can I borrow some pyjama pants?

01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:12.332
I gotta get out of these.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.518
Would you give it
a rest, please?

01:07:25.824 --> 01:07:26.825
- I figured it out.

01:07:30.394 --> 01:07:31.264
- Lay it on me.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:38.750
- The brain. It didn't come
back because we got his brain.

01:07:42.754 --> 01:07:45.757
You can't make a copy once the
master copy is gone, right.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.845
We break the pattern.

01:07:48.542 --> 01:07:49.369
- Richie.

01:07:50.414 --> 01:07:52.155
- None of this was
my original plan.

01:07:54.592 --> 01:07:55.941
I didn't want to come back.

01:08:49.515 --> 01:08:50.560
- Jesus, Richie is that--

01:08:50.604 --> 01:08:51.430
- Dad's rifle.

01:08:52.519 --> 01:08:53.607
This is how it ends.

01:08:56.219 --> 01:09:00.091
And then maybe,
maybe you can leave.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:00.919
- And maybe not.

01:09:01.876 --> 01:09:03.225
Maybe that's not
what's gonna happen.

01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:05.270
Maybe you'll end
up like that thing.

01:09:05.314 --> 01:09:06.142
- I doubt it.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.321
This is all my fault.

01:09:11.363 --> 01:09:12.191
I'm the cause.

01:09:12.234 --> 01:09:13.279
You're caught up in my loop.

01:09:13.323 --> 01:09:16.020
So maybe, if I
close it for good,

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:18.893
then you can walk out of here.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.162
- I can't let you do that.

01:09:26.205 --> 01:09:28.859
Look, I didn't mean
what I said before.

01:09:30.557 --> 01:09:34.518
- This is not a life.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.345
- I can help you.

01:09:36.389 --> 01:09:38.304
- This is not a
life for you, Becca.

01:09:41.568 --> 01:09:42.961
And you deserve to have one.

01:09:49.837 --> 01:09:51.055
Can I show you something?

01:10:05.462 --> 01:10:07.986
[Becca sighs]

01:10:13.992 --> 01:10:14.906
Take a closer look.

01:10:33.794 --> 01:10:35.143
What do you see?

01:10:36.928 --> 01:10:37.755
- I don't know.

01:10:41.628 --> 01:10:43.151
I still see an asshole.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.067
- Exactly.

01:10:48.766 --> 01:10:51.247
[lock clicks]

01:10:54.511 --> 01:10:55.338
- Richie!

01:10:56.382 --> 01:10:57.340
Open the door!

01:11:06.958 --> 01:11:08.786
- That is all I see

01:11:08.829 --> 01:11:13.530
when I look at myself
is one giant asshole.

01:11:17.403 --> 01:11:19.231
I know how much
you've done for me,

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:23.888
how much you do and it kills me

01:11:24.758 --> 01:11:27.108
that you couldn't share
such good news with me.

01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:36.944
I have been trying for so
long to get better for you.

01:11:43.255 --> 01:11:46.911
But I'm tired, Becca, I'm tired

01:11:46.954 --> 01:11:49.261
and I don't want to
feel like this anymore.

01:11:52.699 --> 01:11:56.616
I've been cutting
myself up into pieces,

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.880
trying to put them back
in a way that works.

01:12:00.881 --> 01:12:02.143
But I can't.

01:12:02.187 --> 01:12:05.016
And then this crazy
thing starts happening.

01:12:06.713 --> 01:12:11.239
And I think, maybe, maybethere could be a better version

01:12:11.283 --> 01:12:13.329
of me somewhere in there.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:18.595
But every time I come
back, I'm the exact same,

01:12:20.423 --> 01:12:22.338
the exact fucking same, just me.

01:12:49.016 --> 01:12:50.235
I'm proud of you.

01:12:52.716 --> 01:12:55.371
I am so proud of you

01:12:57.547 --> 01:12:59.549
for taking a chance on yourself

01:12:59.592 --> 01:13:02.290
and proving that you can
have the life that you want.

01:13:08.035 --> 01:13:10.734
This is gonna work, I know it

01:13:10.777 --> 01:13:12.649
and then you can go

01:13:12.692 --> 01:13:14.825
and there will be
nothing holding you back.

01:13:19.046 --> 01:13:21.962
And you'll be great and you're
gonna help so many people.

01:13:24.748 --> 01:13:26.097
- I can take care of you.

01:13:27.098 --> 01:13:29.187
I can, I know it.

01:13:31.842 --> 01:13:32.712
- You have.

01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:39.284
This is not on
you, little sister.

01:13:41.155 --> 01:13:45.116
It's on me, it's
always been on me.

01:13:46.596 --> 01:13:47.945
Just try to remember that.

01:13:48.815 --> 01:13:50.338
- You don't hold me back.

01:13:51.252 --> 01:13:53.907
And you don't have to do this.

01:13:53.951 --> 01:13:56.736
You don't have to do this.

01:13:56.780 --> 01:14:00.827
Please, I need you in my life.

01:14:00.871 --> 01:14:02.916
It's not the same without you.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.528
[fist tapping]

01:14:06.703 --> 01:14:09.357
- I love you.

01:14:09.401 --> 01:14:10.358
I love you so much.

01:14:14.232 --> 01:14:15.059
- No.

01:14:17.104 --> 01:14:17.931
Richie!

01:14:21.282 --> 01:14:22.153
No.

01:14:22.196 --> 01:14:23.720
[dramatic music]

01:14:23.763 --> 01:14:26.679
[door rattling]
No.

01:14:29.377 --> 01:14:30.204
Richie!

01:14:32.903 --> 01:14:34.252
No, turn it off!

01:14:36.733 --> 01:14:41.302
[gun firing]
[Becca whimpering]

01:14:41.346 --> 01:14:42.173
No.

01:14:46.656 --> 01:14:49.354
[Becca sobbing]

01:14:54.446 --> 01:14:55.795
[dramatic music]

01:14:55.839 --> 01:14:56.666
No.

01:15:14.901 --> 01:15:15.728
Come on!

01:15:18.122 --> 01:15:18.949
Be wrong!

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:29.350
Come on.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.514
Goddam you!

01:16:05.169 --> 01:16:07.998
[hammer thudding]

01:16:19.662 --> 01:16:22.360
[Becca gasping]

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:34.720
[loud dramatic music]

01:17:35.128 --> 01:17:37.696
[upbeat music]

01:18:09.162 --> 01:18:12.383
[bright upbeat music]
