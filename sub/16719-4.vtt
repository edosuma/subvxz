00:18.519 --> 00:20.154
Hi!

00:20.221 --> 00:21.422
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.023
Did you read the book I gave you?

00:23.091 --> 00:24.992
You know I did. I'm
almost finished with it.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.760
It's funny 'cause I didn't know anything

00:26.827 --> 00:28.229
about Frantz Fanon before that.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.198
Oh, well, you should; everybody should.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.932
Well, there was something that he wrote

00:31.999 --> 00:34.235
that, uh, I was really moved by.

00:34.302 --> 00:37.871
Um, "Each generation
must discover its mission,

00:37.938 --> 00:40.208
"fulfill it, or betray it."

00:40.274 --> 00:41.742
Now, that was pretty good stuff.

00:41.809 --> 00:42.910
I believe it.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.154
Do you know what else he said?

00:44.178 --> 00:45.413
He wrote, "We revolt

00:45.479 --> 00:47.348
"simply because, for many reasons,

00:47.415 --> 00:48.649
"we can no longer breathe."

00:48.716 --> 00:51.852
Is that why you became revolutionary?

00:51.919 --> 00:53.121
You couldn't breathe?

00:53.187 --> 00:54.455
Not this air. I couldn't...

00:54.522 --> 00:56.056
I couldn't stand to breathe the air

00:56.124 --> 00:58.559
of the hypocritical American politics.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.961
Well, I mean, you know, what government

01:01.028 --> 01:02.363
isn't a little bit hypocritical?

01:02.430 --> 01:05.366
My boyfriend, he was always

01:05.433 --> 01:07.134
rushing me to the emergency room.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.669
And everybody thought it was my heart.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.904
So that's when my shrink explained

01:10.971 --> 01:12.406
that it was psychosomatic.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.575
That I was having these panic attacks

01:14.642 --> 01:16.344
from all the hypocrisy around me,

01:16.410 --> 01:18.146
and so that's when I realized that

01:18.212 --> 01:19.823
the whole system is just
too rotten to be saved

01:19.847 --> 01:21.649
and we're gonna have to start all over.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.517
You know, that's a real coincidence,

01:23.584 --> 01:26.154
'cause Sidney, he
gets panic attacks too.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.321
- Who?
- Sidney.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.190
Uh, S. J. Muntzinger.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.058
He's Kay's... Kay's husband.

01:31.159 --> 01:32.193
He's a moron.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.861
No, he suffers a lot.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.029
Yeah, but he suffers

01:36.164 --> 01:37.341
from the bullshit big questions.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.300
You know, like, the meaning of life

01:39.367 --> 01:41.302
and mortality.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.471
I think he's a passive imbecile.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.339
Well, I wouldn't say he's passive.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.375
He votes liberal, you
know, when he votes.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.243
Big deal, a limousine liberal,

01:49.310 --> 01:50.678
I'm... I'm so impressed.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.214
What matters is not to know the world

01:53.281 --> 01:54.782
but to change it.

01:54.848 --> 01:58.686
Wow, somebody learned their
Frantz Fanon very well.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.222
You know what else old Frantz said

02:01.289 --> 02:04.192
that I buy into 100%?

02:05.426 --> 02:09.430
"Violence is man re-creating himself."

02:10.698 --> 02:11.999
You know, if you don't like

02:12.065 --> 02:14.001
the way that the world is,

02:14.067 --> 02:15.569
you have to change it.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.206
You have to change it yourself.

02:19.207 --> 02:21.675
Jesus, Lenny, you know what you are?

02:21.742 --> 02:23.344
You're charismatic.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.112
Yeah, you've got... you've got charisma.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.214
It's amazing.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.048
My Ellie, she has charisma too.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.283
You know, Ellie, my fiancée.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.760
I've shown you a picture of her, right?

02:30.784 --> 02:33.221
Yeah, she's really beautiful.

02:33.254 --> 02:36.224
Yeah, she... so are
you. You're beautiful.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.558
But you also got something else;

02:37.625 --> 02:39.627
you have something that's very special.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.229
It's like this inner fire, you know?

02:42.230 --> 02:43.740
It's this inner fire; it's almost like

02:43.764 --> 02:45.699
you're a total psychopath but exciting.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.269
Oh, thank you. That is so sweet.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.070
I... it's a compliment, you know?

02:50.137 --> 02:52.072
I mean, it... I mean, you're committed.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.707
You're committed, and I wish I had

02:53.774 --> 02:56.143
an ounce of that fire to move on.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.945
Hey, well, maybe you will someday.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.881
What does your fiancée
think about all this?

03:00.948 --> 03:03.751
What does she think? She
works at an art gallery.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.286
No, that's good.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.255
Art's a really valuable tool.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.256
Uh, for what?

03:09.257 --> 03:11.559
Propaganda, for the revolution.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.063
Geez, you know, the
thought of real change

03:16.129 --> 03:17.765
just is so exciting to me.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.032
Last night, I was alone.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.534
I was in my bed. I was high.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.903
I was... I was reading
about Fidel Castro.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.672
It was so exhilarating.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.276
Can you believe she put a poster

03:29.277 --> 03:31.278
of Che Guevara up in her room?

03:31.279 --> 03:33.547
Oh, he's her god, and what do you care?

03:33.614 --> 03:37.285
However, I did think he
looked a little overweight.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.420
I care. Okay?

03:39.487 --> 03:41.289
You know, she's for
all the right things.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.790
She's for peace,

03:42.856 --> 03:44.658
she's for blacks, she's for Mexicans,

03:44.725 --> 03:46.760
she's for the rights of women.

03:46.827 --> 03:50.130
Yeah, but she should not
put up stuff on our wall.

03:50.197 --> 03:51.465
You know, she's not entitled.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.301
There's this radical arrogance.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.735
It's not permanent.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.203
When she leaves, you'll put back

03:56.304 --> 03:57.538
your poster of Raquel Welch.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.407
Christ. She's been here ten days.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.576
She... she eats my... my Fig Newtons.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.378
She eats my navel oranges.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.313
My... my sister sent
us some stuffed cabbage;

04:06.314 --> 04:07.415
she ate that.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.916
It's just food.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.083
She's a young girl.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.319
She's got a healthy appetite,

04:11.385 --> 04:13.120
and she happens to like what you like.

04:13.186 --> 04:14.355
Yes, meanwhile,

04:14.422 --> 04:15.923
all she does is criticize me.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.326
And... and, you know, she...

04:18.392 --> 04:20.494
And gives me her opinion on everything.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.365
Well, because you represent
consumer capitalism to her.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.534
To her, you're a stooge

04:26.600 --> 04:29.370
of the oligarchy that runs this country.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.539
So why me and not you?

04:31.605 --> 04:33.407
Because she also believes that men

04:33.474 --> 04:35.208
have kept women down.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.710
Oh, Jesus, and where the hell

04:36.777 --> 04:40.080
does she find such a big
poster of Che Guevara?

04:40.147 --> 04:42.783
She, uh, she got it from
Allen, he went into town,

04:42.850 --> 04:45.085
he picked up a lot of books for her,

04:45.152 --> 04:47.120
and he, uh, picked up the poster.

04:47.187 --> 04:49.356
Jesus, you know, Kay,

04:49.357 --> 04:52.560
Allen's getting very cozy with her.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.094
He likes her company.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.429
They like each other's company.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.398
Yeah, but we told his parents

04:57.465 --> 04:59.232
that we would, you know, look after him.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.868
We promised them, and meanwhile,

05:00.934 --> 05:02.269
she's... she's here with him.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.004
She's got him smoking dope.

05:04.071 --> 05:07.708
She's... she's filling his
head full of radical ideas.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.242
Yesterday, I heard them talking;

05:09.377 --> 05:10.578
she was teaching him

05:10.644 --> 05:12.780
how to make a bomb out of fertilizer.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.383
I mean, Christ, and she gives him books.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.850
You know, there are some

05:16.917 --> 05:19.019
very interesting ideas in those books.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.388
There really are.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.755
They make me think that

05:21.822 --> 05:23.824
we've led a life of such isolation.

05:23.891 --> 05:27.695
Such apolitical life,
such... such a cushy life.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.398
Yeah, but meanwhile, I'm tellin' you,

05:30.464 --> 05:33.066
Allen's developing a crush on her.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.402
Oh, don't be silly.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.203
Allen's gonna marry Ellie.

05:36.269 --> 05:39.740
Uh-huh. You're damn right
he's gonna marry Ellie.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.909
You know, God, his parents
are crazy about her.

05:41.975 --> 05:45.112
She's perfect for him.
She's a lovely girl.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.281
Hey, what happened to the...

05:48.416 --> 05:50.784
the shrimp in black bean sauce

05:50.851 --> 05:53.186
that I brought home from
Wing Yi's last night?

05:53.253 --> 05:54.722
I ate it.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.056
You ate it?

05:56.123 --> 05:57.691
Yep, was it in the little, uh,

05:57.758 --> 05:59.159
a little white carton

05:59.226 --> 06:00.346
next to a box of fried rice?

06:00.428 --> 06:01.529
Yeah.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.531
Finito, done. But you know what?

06:03.597 --> 06:05.065
You should really be thanking me,

06:05.132 --> 06:06.852
'cause at your age,
you shouldn't be eating

06:06.900 --> 06:09.002
rice and sauces; it's
not easy to digest.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.539
You should just put crackers
into a bowl of warm milk.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.742
Oh, my book club.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.076
Oh, I hope they like the books

06:16.143 --> 06:17.077
that I recommended.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.546
Oh, they will.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.715
She's... she's recommending
books to you, Kay?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.884
Kay, do you... are you following this?

06:23.951 --> 06:25.711
- She ate my... she ate my...
- I understand.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.555
She ate your food. She ate your food.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.257
You can afford more black
bean sauce and shrimp.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.659
Coming!

06:31.725 --> 06:32.993
Oh, God, I'm tired.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.628
I didn't get much sleep last night.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.464
Some idiot was up
playing the television set

06:36.497 --> 06:37.498
till 2:00 in the morning.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.032
That was me. Do you mind?

06:39.099 --> 06:40.167
Yeah, I figured.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.835
No one else in this house is dumb enough

06:41.902 --> 06:43.837
to watch baseball from 7:00 till 2:00.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.206
Well, I'm sorry. It was
an extra inning game.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.374
So what?

06:47.475 --> 06:48.518
What do you mean, "So what"?

06:48.542 --> 06:49.643
So I wanted to see

06:49.710 --> 06:51.178
if the Mets would beat the Dodgers.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.380
- Who cares?
- Who care...

06:53.481 --> 06:54.548
I'll tell ya who cares.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.383
Me and millions of Americans,

06:56.484 --> 06:58.752
who love baseball and Thanksgiving

06:58.819 --> 07:00.921
and who figure we can fix the country

07:00.988 --> 07:02.590
without overthrowing the government.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.892
Sports, just another
opium for the people.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.894
Hey, your crowd thinks opium

07:06.960 --> 07:08.896
should be the opium of the people.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.531
You know who plays baseball?

07:10.598 --> 07:11.765
Wilt Chamberlain?

07:11.832 --> 07:14.201
No, no, Fidel Castro... your hero.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.636
I doubt it.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.638
I'm tellin' you, Fidel
Castro plays baseball.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.306
When he's not using the sports stadium

07:19.372 --> 07:20.674
to shoot people.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.976
Okay, well, if you overthrow
a murderous dictator

07:23.043 --> 07:24.812
and create a successful revolution,

07:24.878 --> 07:27.515
I think you can treat
yourself to a double header.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.017
Hey, you don't... you
don't like me, right?

07:30.083 --> 07:33.086
Am... am I reading that correctly?

07:33.153 --> 07:34.588
I don't dislike you.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.824
It's just... everything
that you stand for.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.526
Yeah, but why? I don't understand.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.036
What do I stand for that's so terrible?

07:40.060 --> 07:41.529
I got a house. I got a wife.

07:41.595 --> 07:44.031
I got a car. Okay, I got two cars.

07:44.097 --> 07:47.034
I mean, you know, I
got... I got possess...

07:47.100 --> 07:49.536
you know, like my appliances.

07:49.537 --> 07:52.640
But... but did I...
did I exploit any blacks

07:52.706 --> 07:54.141
to buy my blender?

07:54.207 --> 07:56.343
Did I... did I bomb any Vietnamese kids

07:56.409 --> 07:58.345
when I was young?

07:58.411 --> 07:59.547
I grew up in Brooklyn.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.214
Mr. Popkin had a candy store.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.716
He had a hot fudge machine.

08:02.783 --> 08:05.686
I always wanted a hot
fudge machine my whole life.

08:05.753 --> 08:06.987
I vowed when I got older,

08:07.054 --> 08:08.455
I would have a hot fudge machine,

08:08.556 --> 08:10.157
and now I have one.

08:10.223 --> 08:13.193
And you're not gonna smear
sheep's blood on it either.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.163
You know, you should not
be out here so casually.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.565
Her book club is in there,

08:17.598 --> 08:19.700
and if one of those yentas sees you,

08:19.767 --> 08:22.469
this is all over.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.805
I assume that you've all read the book

08:24.872 --> 08:26.339
I gave you for this week.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.844
Okay, it was given to
me by an acquaintance,

08:30.911 --> 08:32.455
and at first, I didn't want to read it.

08:32.479 --> 08:33.914
I thought I would be bored.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.950
And then I was just
fascinated by its wisdom.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.120
And it is, of course, the...

08:40.187 --> 08:43.691
the "Quotations of
Chairman Mao Tse-Tung",

08:43.756 --> 08:46.059
and its author is, um,

08:46.126 --> 08:47.595
Mao Tse-Tung,

08:47.628 --> 08:50.063
and, anyway, you know, I...

08:50.130 --> 08:51.865
You know who he is, of course.

08:51.932 --> 08:55.035
He's... he's the man who... that jacket,

08:55.102 --> 08:58.038
that extremely stylish little jacket

08:58.105 --> 08:59.272
is named after.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.710
I love those Mao jackets.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.713
Yes, it's very simple but it has

09:05.779 --> 09:08.982
kind of an understated charm.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.852
Yes, well, the Chinese really have

09:11.919 --> 09:14.454
a great visual sense.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.223
Mao's a great man.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.390
Why?

09:17.457 --> 09:19.026
Why is Mao a great man?

09:19.092 --> 09:21.729
Well, if he did nothing else but stop

09:21.795 --> 09:24.798
that hideous practice of foot binding.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.635
Can you imagine having your feet bound?

09:27.701 --> 09:30.403
I bought a pair of shoes
last week at Bergdorf's.

09:30.470 --> 09:34.474
And they fit in the store,
but when I got them home,

09:34.541 --> 09:36.343
they were too small.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.813
You understand that Bergdorf's

09:39.880 --> 09:43.083
is not the same as... as foot binding.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.752
I don't know.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.920
They were very expensive shoes.

09:46.987 --> 09:50.223
And they were at least a size too small.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.091
Tell me about it.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.425
The minute you take them

09:52.492 --> 09:54.094
out of the store, they hurt.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.929
Incidentally, I love the black shoes

09:55.996 --> 09:58.198
you wore to Nancy's sweet 16.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.767
Those were Ferragamo.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.368
They looked like Ferragamo.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.871
Let's get back to Chairman Mao.

10:03.937 --> 10:08.041
The quotation of his that
I really love the most is,

10:08.108 --> 10:12.880
"Politics is war without bloodshed.

10:12.946 --> 10:17.050
"And war is politics with bloodshed."

10:17.117 --> 10:19.386
I think that's so meaningful.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.588
Exactly what does that mean?

10:21.655 --> 10:25.392
I don't know, but I know
it's open to interpretation.

10:25.458 --> 10:30.097
Well, I think it means that war is a way

10:30.163 --> 10:35.936
of settling, um, political
issues with force.

10:36.003 --> 10:39.239
Like they... all the
stuff in Vietnam now.

10:39.306 --> 10:43.443
What political issues
are we trying to settle?

10:43.510 --> 10:45.445
I know. The domino effect.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.681
Why should we send our
grandsons and our sons

10:47.748 --> 10:51.184
to Asia to kill Asian men and women,

10:51.251 --> 10:54.722
just to satisfy the...
the economic desires

10:54.788 --> 10:56.623
- of some plutocrat?
- Mm-hmm.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.959
I don't understand.

10:59.026 --> 11:02.329
Since when have you become so militant

11:02.395 --> 11:04.731
about all this stuff?

11:04.732 --> 11:07.334
I have a friend who I've been talking to

11:07.400 --> 11:09.737
and who has been giving me books.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.572
Does that mean you're on LSD?

11:12.639 --> 11:13.841
LSD?

11:13.907 --> 11:15.776
What are you talking about?

11:15.843 --> 11:18.111
Were our forefathers on LSD

11:18.178 --> 11:21.749
when they went out and shot
their British oppressors?

11:21.782 --> 11:24.551
And let's not forget
the Boston Tea Party.

11:24.617 --> 11:25.753
Speaking of that,

11:25.786 --> 11:27.888
did you read that a study found

11:27.955 --> 11:30.858
that green tea is very good for you?

11:30.924 --> 11:33.026
Much healthier than the kind we drink.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.628
I don't like Chinese's tea.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.230
I do.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.232
Smoked Tea.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.402
Lapsang Souchong.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.904
Have you tried it?

11:43.971 --> 11:46.273
Smoked Tea always
tastes like bacon to me.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.941
I hate it.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.777
I wouldn't care if the Indians threw

11:49.843 --> 11:53.080
all the Smoked Tea overboard in Boston.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.515
Wasn't it people dressed like Indians?

11:55.582 --> 11:57.851
Indians are another minority

11:57.918 --> 11:59.786
that we have exploited and raped.

11:59.787 --> 12:02.222
Yes, we took their land.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.357
Well, you know, this is
a very warlike country.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.826
I mean, remember this, uh,

12:05.893 --> 12:07.795
didn't General Custer... remember him?

12:07.861 --> 12:09.496
Didn't he go and get himself killed?

12:09.562 --> 12:10.630
Uh-huh.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.200
Yes, he was gored by a bull.

12:13.266 --> 12:17.670
No, Gayle, that was Sitting Bull.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.807
A... a bull sat on him?

12:19.873 --> 12:21.809
You know what we should really do?

12:21.875 --> 12:23.977
We should go into town

12:24.044 --> 12:25.678
and lie down in front of the entrance

12:25.813 --> 12:27.614
of the local draft board.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.816
And we stop traffic.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.518
Don't we have to be naked?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.987
Naked, ha! Well, what on...

12:34.054 --> 12:36.823
Why on Earth, to do that?

12:36.824 --> 12:38.859
Well, it's a form of civil disobedience.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.693
Although I'm telling
this group right now,

12:40.828 --> 12:44.131
if we're naked, I have to
lose six to eight pounds.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.433
We'll bring a quart of pigs' blood.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.836
Yes, to smear on the draft records.

12:48.869 --> 12:52.305
It represents the blood of the slain.

12:52.372 --> 12:55.475
I am for it.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.010
When do we do it?

12:57.077 --> 12:58.378
How about next Saturday?

12:58.445 --> 12:59.913
Oh, I can't. We have a Bar Mitzvah.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.581
Oh, yeah, um, Monday, then?

13:01.648 --> 13:02.582
Monday's good.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.151
We lie down...

13:04.217 --> 13:05.418
Naked.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.954
I'm gonna wear a bra and panties,

13:07.020 --> 13:10.423
and that's... shocking enough for me.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.860
I'm gonna burn my bra.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.094
I could bring some snacks.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.529
I... I'm very good with oatmeal cookies.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.265
But not with nuts.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.967
A naked sit-in.

13:20.033 --> 13:23.971
Chairman Mao would be so proud.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.237
What are you thinking?

13:25.272 --> 13:26.406
Nothing. I'm fine.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.740
You're so distant.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.742
Well, mm...

13:29.877 --> 13:31.044
Well, I was thinking

13:31.111 --> 13:33.180
if we should have two kids or three.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.291
I mean, I know we always said
we'd have a boy and a girl,

13:35.315 --> 13:37.117
but it... maybe we're
thinking too small.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.952
We could even adopt one, you know,

13:39.019 --> 13:40.529
and... and that way,
we could pick the sex.

13:40.553 --> 13:41.488
You know, um...

13:41.554 --> 13:42.754
Well, and, of course, after...

13:42.789 --> 13:44.892
after I've experienced pregnancy twice.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.895
Look, don't panic when I say this, okay?

13:47.928 --> 13:51.731
But, um, are we resigning ourselves

13:51.798 --> 13:54.501
to this middle-class life?

13:54.567 --> 13:57.570
You know, the idea of
the home, the hearth,

13:57.637 --> 13:59.072
dogs, kids, all that,

13:59.139 --> 14:00.941
and meanwhile, all over the world,

14:01.008 --> 14:03.210
there's just so much to be done,

14:03.276 --> 14:06.479
and here in our country,
there's so much to fix.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.182
Well, I'm... I'm against the war,

14:09.249 --> 14:10.951
if that's what you're getting at.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.953
I mean, don't you think that America

14:13.020 --> 14:15.188
somehow lost its way?

14:15.255 --> 14:16.789
Well, yes, in many areas, sure,

14:16.924 --> 14:19.292
but it's still the greatest
country in the world.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.703
Yeah, the greatest country on Earth.

14:20.727 --> 14:21.929
I know. I get that.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.830
But, God, what does
that even mean anymore?

14:23.931 --> 14:25.966
Well, where is it better?

14:26.033 --> 14:28.468
I'm not saying that. I'm just saying...

14:28.535 --> 14:31.538
Don't you think as a
rich, strong democracy,

14:31.604 --> 14:33.440
it's our job to lead?

14:33.506 --> 14:36.409
Since when are you so
intense over all this?

14:36.476 --> 14:38.745
I don't know. I just got to wondering,

14:38.811 --> 14:43.283
would we really be happy
living this easy, safe life

14:43.350 --> 14:45.585
in some sanitized neighborhood and...

14:47.020 --> 14:48.655
Well, it's important to

14:48.721 --> 14:50.490
have a social conscience.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.792
It's important to support
the right candidates

14:52.859 --> 14:54.294
and give to the right charities,

14:54.361 --> 14:56.463
but what more can you do?

14:56.529 --> 14:57.529
What more can you do?

14:57.564 --> 14:59.199
God, some of these monks in Asia,

14:59.266 --> 15:01.168
they set themselves on fire, you know?

15:01.234 --> 15:04.171
I don't think your
parents would like that.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.873
Don't you think that some
of these black leaders,

15:06.974 --> 15:08.976
they have a case for reparations?

15:09.009 --> 15:11.444
I... I'm a democratic liberal,

15:11.511 --> 15:13.313
which, in my family, is heresy,

15:13.380 --> 15:15.448
but that's as far as I go.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.317
I'm on the side of the oppressed,

15:17.384 --> 15:20.620
but I'm not willing to
pour gasoline on myself

15:20.687 --> 15:21.989
and light me.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.456
Fine. Take it easy. I'm just...

15:23.523 --> 15:25.358
We're talking here. Relax.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.061
You're getting that
wild look in your eye.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.063
All right, look, I'm not saying that

15:30.130 --> 15:31.631
there aren't wars worth fighting.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.800
Yes, there are, and, God,
Chairman Mao even said it.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.236
"There are just wars, and
there are unjust wars."

15:36.303 --> 15:38.605
Just be careful not to
die in an unjust war.

15:38.671 --> 15:39.906
Who said that?

15:40.007 --> 15:41.408
Mao.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.376
Allen, you're starting
to sound a little crazy.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.246
Like those crazy people
in the Weather Underground

15:46.313 --> 15:48.748
or the Panthers or
that creepy-looking girl

15:48.815 --> 15:50.317
who shot her way out of jail.

15:50.383 --> 15:53.086
I mean, they're...
that's how they think.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.122
They... they're crazy.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.224
You think she's creepy-looking?

15:57.290 --> 16:00.393
Look, honestly, I'm not really
following it that closely.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.063
But, my God, I've never
seen this side of you.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.490
Well, I shouldn't really say that.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.533
You do tend to make
some seditious remarks

16:06.599 --> 16:08.235
when you drink too much.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.503
I have to sneak the call.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.305
Muntzinger doesn't
want me usin' the phone

16:12.372 --> 16:13.840
'cause he thinks it's tapped.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.542
He's a total paranoid.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.077
I can't wait to get outta here

16:17.144 --> 16:18.554
so I never have to hear him complaining

16:18.578 --> 16:21.881
about me eating his Fig
Newton sand navel oranges

16:21.948 --> 16:23.883
ever again.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.852
No, I understand.

16:25.918 --> 16:27.854
I'm gonna get it to you.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.556
I got the location. I got to go.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.091
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.561
You're back late.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.505
I thought you'd be staying
at your girlfriend's.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.198
We had a tiff.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.200
True love never runs smoothly.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.368
It's weird, you know?

16:41.434 --> 16:43.070
Like, I mean, we rarely fight,

16:43.136 --> 16:44.571
but... I don't know.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.673
This one was about
America's exploitation

16:46.739 --> 16:48.841
of Cuba under Batista, so...

16:48.908 --> 16:50.077
Well, you've certainly read

16:50.110 --> 16:52.079
everything that I recommended.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.847
Yeah. Hey, I got you a book.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.383
- You did?
- Yeah.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.955
"The Life and Times of the Shmoo."

17:03.090 --> 17:05.291
I thought you'd like it.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.826
It's a comic book.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.529
Well, yeah, but it's by Al Capp.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.332
Who's Al Capp, and what's a Shmoo?

17:12.398 --> 17:14.134
Al Capp, he wrote Li'l Abner.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.367
You know, you'll see.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.002
It's funny. You'll like it.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.314
I don't have time for comic books.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.647
My God, you sound like Ninotchka.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.574
You know, not every book
has to be a manifesto.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.010
Hey, Ninotchka, if I remember right,

17:24.111 --> 17:27.513
gets seduced by Western imperialism.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.580
She falls in love with the
opposite of a Communist.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.151
Hey, I'm not a Communist, you know?

17:31.218 --> 17:32.885
The Communists betrayed
their revolution.

17:32.952 --> 17:35.188
Can we take a breather from
politics tonight, please?

17:35.255 --> 17:36.189
It's a beautiful night.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.557
Have you seen the full moon?

17:37.624 --> 17:38.425
No.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.693
Well, you gotta see it. Come on.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.369
All right, you're right.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.903
It's really pretty.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.139
Yeah.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.808
A very, very pretty moon.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.178
It is.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.718
That's a big mistake.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.520
- Why?
- Because.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.589
It's one thing if you
want to hang out with me

18:09.656 --> 18:12.292
or go to bed with me or smoke a joint.

18:12.359 --> 18:15.662
But... you're falling in love.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.231
Kay, he's... he's kissing her.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.600
He's... can you believe
it? He's kissing her.

18:20.667 --> 18:21.901
Will you stop spying?

18:21.968 --> 18:23.069
Oh, I don't understand it.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.171
He's gonna marry a lovely girl.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.806
Why is he kissing a convict?

18:26.873 --> 18:28.308
And will you stop listening in

18:28.375 --> 18:30.310
on her phone conversations?

18:30.377 --> 18:32.179
You think I'm the only one listening in?

18:32.245 --> 18:34.181
You... you don't think
Hoover's on the line?

18:34.247 --> 18:37.016
I can hear J. Edgar Hoover breathing.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.818
Chairman Mao says,"No girl

18:38.885 --> 18:40.820
"is worth achieving
without some effort."

18:40.887 --> 18:43.556
For God's sakes, stop with
the fortune cookies, okay?

18:43.623 --> 18:46.025
I don't... what do I care
what Chairman Mao says?

18:46.092 --> 18:47.394
Okay, I think he's just

18:47.460 --> 18:50.463
a very interesting
political philosopher.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.799
That's not your business.
You're a suburban grandmother.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.768
For God's sakes, you shouldn't
be thinking radical politics.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.238
You should be thinking hip replacement.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.240
It was so cute yesterday

19:00.307 --> 19:03.276
when they talked about
bombing the Pentagon.

19:03.343 --> 19:06.946
You think it's charming that he never...

19:07.013 --> 19:11.117
he never spoke like that
until she got her hands on him.

19:11.218 --> 19:13.320
Oh, you can't legislate feeling.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.687
In China, they do.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.456
Hey, could you two keep it down?

19:16.523 --> 19:17.857
I'm gonna go to bed.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.260
Stop kissing our house guest.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.661
I knew you were spying on me.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.230
I can spy on anyone I want.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.597
This is my house.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.633
What, does Allen need your permission

19:26.699 --> 19:27.767
to fall in love?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.602
Well, ahem, Allen is in love,

19:29.669 --> 19:31.037
and they're going to be married,

19:31.103 --> 19:34.106
and this is gonna be a triangle.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.243
Don't worry. I'm leaving soon.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.577
Hey, soon's not quick enough.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.879
Could you go a little earlier than soon?

19:39.946 --> 19:41.481
You know what? You're the type that,

19:41.548 --> 19:42.858
when the revolution comes, they're gonna

19:42.882 --> 19:44.484
put up against a wall and shoot.

19:44.551 --> 19:45.852
You hear what she's saying?

19:45.918 --> 19:47.062
That's how they treat people.

19:47.086 --> 19:48.254
That's where they go.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.689
They round up all the nice people.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.758
They confiscate, you know, whatever...

19:51.824 --> 19:53.092
their navel oranges,

19:53.159 --> 19:55.562
and if they say
anything, they shoot 'em.

19:55.628 --> 19:58.164
I don't know why I'm
discussing this with you.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.832
I should just call the police.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.369
Yeah, I'm surprised you
haven't, you little fascist.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.271
You even look like the guy in the movies

20:04.337 --> 20:07.073
that always plays the sniveling coward.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.375
Oh, it's his haircut.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.809
Wait. Who am I thinkin' of?

20:09.876 --> 20:11.177
Peter Lorre.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.755
What's going on? Is
everything all right?

20:12.779 --> 20:13.513
I heard shouting.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.014
He's spying on you.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.116
I'm spying on you, not him.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.951
What can I say? Sid, Kay,

20:19.018 --> 20:22.088
I'm wrestling with my feelings.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.823
This really isn't our affair.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.057
How can you say...

20:25.124 --> 20:26.893
You're the one that introduced him

20:26.959 --> 20:28.395
to this Venus flytrap.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.662
All right, I'm not doing this.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.264
I'm not gonna stand here and be judged

20:31.331 --> 20:33.266
by this middlebrow dimwit.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.010
Kay, could I talk to
you just for a second?

20:35.034 --> 20:36.336
Privately.

20:36.403 --> 20:39.672
My wife and I have
no secrets between us.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.476
And you... I don't understand.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.479
You're throwing away a whole career.

20:46.546 --> 20:49.015
Sid, I have to ask you a
serious question, all right.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.850
Man to man, off the record.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.920
Do you think I could
make a living in Cuba?

20:53.986 --> 20:55.054
Where?

20:55.121 --> 20:56.423
In Cuba.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.758
I... I hope I didn't hear what I heard.

20:58.825 --> 20:59.825
Oh, I'm serious.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.537
Do you think I could
make a living in Cuba?

21:01.561 --> 21:03.763
As what?

21:03.830 --> 21:05.765
A leader of a mariachi band?

21:05.832 --> 21:06.733
What about Algeria?

21:06.799 --> 21:08.334
They have no extradition treaty.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.002
They need educated Americans.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.504
Right, in the Casbah.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.806
You'll open the Pépé
le Moko Brokerage Firm.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.842
Why do you think this is so crazy?

21:15.908 --> 21:18.545
Well, you... I just
don't understand this.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.246
You were in love with this girl...

21:20.347 --> 21:22.482
so quickly, it falls apart?

21:22.549 --> 21:24.050
I'm having second thoughts.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.386
Your whole life, you were groomed

21:26.453 --> 21:28.955
for a... a lucrative job.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.823
I know, but could I
enjoy the privileged life

21:30.890 --> 21:33.192
knowing that my brethren are suffering?

21:33.259 --> 21:34.527
Your brethren?

21:34.594 --> 21:36.095
What is this? The Old Testament?

21:36.162 --> 21:39.031
A small plane, at night...
we could cross the border.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.900
You know, I think you've been smoking

21:40.967 --> 21:43.135
too many of those amusing cigarettes.

21:43.202 --> 21:44.370
And Lenny... she mentioned something

21:44.371 --> 21:46.773
about a Piper Cub, a two-seater.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.475
Yes, two-seater, her and the pilot.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.301
What? Are they gonna
strap you to the wings?

21:50.377 --> 21:52.812
She said she had a connection
with somebody who flies.

21:52.879 --> 21:53.946
They own a plane or...

21:54.013 --> 21:56.015
Look, I'm just kicking
around ideas here.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.551
Well, don't kick around
ideas, because this girl

21:58.618 --> 22:01.388
is gonna have us all
in the penitentiary.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.390
I... I haven't even
mentioned this to Lenny.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.824
Don't mention it.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.659
Don't think about it
anymore, if I were you.

22:06.726 --> 22:10.397
I would just get some
sleep, and if, you know,

22:10.430 --> 22:12.110
if you still feel that
way in the morning,

22:12.164 --> 22:13.733
we can discuss a lobotomy.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.234
Sid, there's something about her.

22:15.301 --> 22:16.436
It just turns me on.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.783
Yes, I know. Freud speaks of it.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.472
It's called a death wish.

22:19.539 --> 22:20.973
And... and what did she want?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.408
- What did she want?
- Nothing, really.

22:22.409 --> 22:23.476
Tell me what she wanted.

22:23.543 --> 22:24.644
Nothing, honestly, really.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.045
Don't... she wanted something

22:26.112 --> 22:27.547
that I'm not allowed to hear.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.057
Honey, really, she didn't want a thing.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.950
It was just a little...
tiny little thing.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.452
I'm so exhausted.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.953
Just wait a minute.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.155
I'm not going to sleep
till you tell me what it is.

22:36.222 --> 22:37.824
Does she love him?

22:37.890 --> 22:39.726
She wanted a tiny little favor.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.462
I'm just falling asleep
on my feet, really.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.767
It's gonna happen,
yeah. She's gonna do it.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.971
I know, it's... it's really risky,

22:52.038 --> 22:55.041
but, I mean, I can't stay
here forever, you know.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.445
Okay.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.312
No, she's a good egg. She's...

23:00.447 --> 23:03.315
She's willing.

23:03.450 --> 23:04.817
I can't speak.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.754
I think the idiot just picked up.
