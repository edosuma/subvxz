WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:03.294
(indistinct chattering)

00:03.378 --> 00:05.588
MAN: I need a ride home later on, okay?

00:07.340 --> 00:08.925
WOMAN: See that coat over there?

00:09.009 --> 00:12.220
(chattering continues)

00:14.139 --> 00:16.725
All right. Item 14.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.770
We've still got a gang
of juveniles at 119th Street

00:20.854 --> 00:23.773
hitting on old people,
cashing Social Security checks.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.860
(indistinct chattering)

00:26.943 --> 00:30.530
So, uh, how about
let's give that situation

00:30.613 --> 00:33.116
a little extra effort, huh?

00:33.199 --> 00:35.160
MAN: Hear, hear!

00:35.660 --> 00:39.247
All right. Item 15. Item 15!

00:39.330 --> 00:42.917
At this point in time,
we got the same purse snatcher

00:43.001 --> 00:45.545
working wolf from the projects on South.

00:45.628 --> 00:46.880
(a man coughs)

00:46.963 --> 00:49.841
He's a male black, age approximately 30,

00:49.924 --> 00:52.635
6'6" tall, medium build.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.556
He's further described
as wearing a long blond wig...

00:56.639 --> 01:01.019
-(laughing)
-...powder blue cocktail-type dress

01:01.102 --> 01:04.314
gathered in little tucks at the waist.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.400
-(laughing continues)
-Ain't that sweet?

01:07.484 --> 01:10.570
(jeering)

01:10.653 --> 01:13.990
Item 16: gang homicides.

01:14.824 --> 01:16.659
We had two last night.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.079
There are gonna be reprisals.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.122
You got anything to add to that, Lamonica?

01:21.206 --> 01:23.666
Yes, Sarge. Looks like
the 124th Street gang done it.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.919
Oh, pure genius, Lamonica.

01:26.002 --> 01:29.255
-No kidding!
-All right, last item.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.717
Last item is a directive from
Divisional Commander Swanson.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.385
(groaning)

01:34.469 --> 01:37.972
Concerning the alleged carrying
of bizarre and unauthorized weapons

01:38.056 --> 01:39.641
by the officers of this precinct.

01:39.724 --> 01:42.602
Said officers are hereby warned

01:42.685 --> 01:45.522
to immediately surrender such weapons

01:45.605 --> 01:50.443
to the custody of their sergeant
or face disciplinary action.

01:50.527 --> 01:55.031
-(officers murmuring)
-Said weapons inspection starts now!

01:55.115 --> 01:57.158
(murmurous chattering)

02:06.042 --> 02:08.837
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.924
Hey, let's be careful out there.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.388
(chattering continues)

02:28.314 --> 02:30.692
So she's standing
in her apartment door in her bathrobe,

02:30.775 --> 02:32.569
see, and showing me her driver's license.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.613
She says, "Renko, the time has come.
Let's get on it and get it on."

02:35.697 --> 02:38.074
-Get on it and get it on, huh?
-Get on it and get it on!

02:38.158 --> 02:39.951
Hey, Renko, hold on, hold on.

02:40.034 --> 02:41.744
Did you grow some recently?

02:42.704 --> 02:45.081
No, no, it's my boots. They make me tall.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.458
Actually, they're your basic dress boots.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.377
Oh, they're nice, Renko. Real nice.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.796
They make you look, uh, strong.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.840
Stronger than a mare's breath, my friend.

02:53.923 --> 02:57.093
(men whistling, laughing)

02:57.177 --> 02:58.553
Oh, no.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.054
Now, don't you be doing that to me!

03:00.138 --> 03:02.015
You tell that girl
next time she comes in here

03:02.098 --> 03:03.808
to have some respect
for an officer of the law.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.102
You move it, hair bag!

03:06.186 --> 03:09.147
-(indistinct chattering)
-MAN: Belker.

03:10.398 --> 03:11.774
I said move!

03:16.905 --> 03:19.032
Hey, this is a rout!

03:19.115 --> 03:20.867
(growling)

03:20.950 --> 03:22.702
-He's crazy!
-Right this way, ladies.

03:22.785 --> 03:26.706
Your accommodations are ready.
Smoking or nonsmoking?

03:27.916 --> 03:30.418
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:30.501 --> 03:32.587
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

03:32.670 --> 03:36.549
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:43.556 --> 03:47.477
(theme music playing)

04:43.783 --> 04:45.660
-MAN: I'm glad.
-Whoo!

04:45.743 --> 04:49.956
(speaking Spanish)

04:50.039 --> 04:53.293
-What? What?
-(indistinct shouting)

04:53.376 --> 04:56.546
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?

04:56.629 --> 04:57.964
(shouts in Spanish)

05:03.720 --> 05:05.471
(shouting in Spanish)

05:05.555 --> 05:07.056
-BOY: Let go, man!
-Hey! Hey! Hey!

05:07.140 --> 05:09.142
I told you to shut up!

05:09.225 --> 05:11.352
Or I'm gonna send you all
to a psychiatrist.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.482
(quiet chattering)

05:16.566 --> 05:18.901
(shouts in Spanish) You die, huh!

05:19.485 --> 05:20.528
Look at this.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.488
You got the address wrong
on their warrant.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.784
Captain, we never should've
stopped doing these in pencil.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.954
So when the man understandably
objects to being arrested,

05:30.038 --> 05:31.456
Earps here hits him with a board.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.877
We had to, boss.
We couldn't get his attention.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.838
Get him outta here. Buy him breakfast.

05:38.921 --> 05:40.298
Tell him we owe him one.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.844
And don't hurt him anymore.
Don't touch him.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.554
Don't even shake his hand!

05:48.222 --> 05:49.265
I don't know, Phil.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.933
We all err, Francis.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.060
What?

05:53.353 --> 05:56.522
Grade school
and precinct visitation program?

05:56.606 --> 05:58.816
Sure we got one.
We've had one up here for years.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.735
WOMAN (over phone):
<i>To interface with the police.</i>

06:00.818 --> 06:04.947
To interface with the police experience.
I see.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.325
WOMAN (over phone):
<i>Yes, I knew you would understand.</i>

06:08.451 --> 06:10.870
Yeah, ma'am. Yeah, well, ma'am?

06:10.953 --> 06:12.705
Ma'am, why not take my word for it?

06:12.789 --> 06:14.582
I doubt there's a kid in this district

06:14.665 --> 06:17.293
who hasn't interfaced
with the police experience.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.628
Interfaced?

06:28.137 --> 06:30.181
Okay, gorgeous, come on.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.600
-Let's go save the public.
-Mm-hmm.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.355
-It's her, man. She's back.
-(phone ringing)

06:39.732 --> 06:42.652
(men chattering lustfully)

06:42.735 --> 06:45.488
-(speaking Spanish)
-Uh-huh.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.620
(man whistles, coughs)

06:55.289 --> 06:57.625
All right, Furillo.
I want him and I want him now.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.085
-Where is he?
-Where is who?

06:59.168 --> 07:02.004
Ray, would you instruct the lady
to please have a seat outside--

07:02.088 --> 07:05.425
My client is due in court
in exactly 45 minutes!

07:05.508 --> 07:06.801
Now, where is he?

07:08.636 --> 07:09.887
WOMAN: Ten-four.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.517
(indistinct chattering)

07:21.274 --> 07:24.026
(chattering continues)

07:32.034 --> 07:33.703
Care for a little while you're waiting?

07:36.497 --> 07:37.832
Sure. Why not.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.502
-Cream in your coffee?
-No, thank you.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.467
I'm Detective John LaRue.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.510
That's nice.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.180
Oh, may I?

07:52.263 --> 07:53.723
Oh, those are beautiful.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.352
Do you know what they're worth
by the ounce?

08:00.897 --> 08:02.231
Are you quite finished?

08:03.774 --> 08:05.026
No, ma'am.

08:06.068 --> 08:09.447
I never seem to quite finish
for hours and hours.

08:12.909 --> 08:16.162
Miss Davenport,
the captain will see you now.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.138
What about it?
Is he here or is he elsewhere?

08:34.222 --> 08:36.390
Don't get excited, Counselor,
we're working on it.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.559
How's this for logic, Furillo?

08:38.643 --> 08:41.354
If he's not here,
and if he's not elsewhere,

08:41.437 --> 08:43.314
-he's lost.
-We didn't say that, Counselor.

08:43.397 --> 08:45.525
-DAVENPORT: You lost my client.
-Not lost, per se.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.735
-Misplaced is more like it.
-Look, Ms. Davenport,

08:47.818 --> 08:49.070
the way it lays out is this.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.322
-Besides being a pervert,--
-Alleged pervert.

08:51.405 --> 08:54.825
Mr. Thorpe, because he convinced
the duty officer he was claustrophobic,

08:54.909 --> 08:56.285
got transferred to County Medical.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.746
I called County Medical.
He's not there either.

08:58.829 --> 09:01.207
Now, that isn't necessarily true.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.626
A prisoner might be there,
or might not be there,

09:03.709 --> 09:05.878
-in an official sense--
-For that matter,

09:05.962 --> 09:08.130
he could be in transit between facilities.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.966
Or he could've gotten on the wrong bus.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.927
You know, those buses from county lockup
are not legibly marked.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.513
Francis, we oughta interface
with County on that one.

09:15.596 --> 09:19.100
Never in my entire life have I
listened to so much incompetence

09:19.183 --> 09:21.727
covered up by so much unmitigated crap!

09:21.811 --> 09:23.521
And don't think for one minute, Furillo,

09:23.604 --> 09:25.314
that the court
isn't going to hear about this.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.234
Because, if I am not mistaken,
you are sitting in contempt.

09:28.317 --> 09:29.694
Counselor, suppose we drive off

09:29.777 --> 09:31.946
-that bridge when we come to it.
-That's so typically fascist!

09:32.029 --> 09:33.239
Now, if you'll excuse us…

09:35.575 --> 09:37.577
Find my client, Furillo,

09:38.286 --> 09:41.664
or I swear, I'll have you up on charges.

09:43.791 --> 09:49.297
Mm, that young woman
has a very handsome carriage.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.717
With 20 more pounds, she would be perfect.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.594
Call around, will you, Ray?

09:54.677 --> 09:57.179
-Huh?
-Put a flag out on him.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.556
(phone ringing)

09:58.639 --> 10:01.434
-(screaming)
-You're crazy, man!

10:01.517 --> 10:05.187
(shouting continues)

10:08.983 --> 10:10.651
Hey, guys, break it up!

10:10.735 --> 10:12.903
(screaming continues)

10:21.120 --> 10:22.455
MAN: Somebody get this guy!

10:22.538 --> 10:25.708
-(shouting continues)
-I got him! I got him!

10:25.791 --> 10:29.337
-WOMAN: Hey, a little help!
-(screaming continues)

10:39.972 --> 10:42.308
-Break it up!
-(indistinct shouting)

10:43.643 --> 10:44.644
MAN: Let me up!

10:44.727 --> 10:46.729
(growling, snarling)

10:50.191 --> 10:53.861
-I got ya!
-Don't do it! No biting!

10:53.944 --> 10:55.196
No biting, Mick.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.448
MAN: Okay, just keep him down here.

10:57.531 --> 10:59.450
-You promised me, Captain.
-WOMAN: Take it easy!

10:59.533 --> 11:01.661
-MAN: Get his legs!
-FURILLO: Take it easy, Mick.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.872
You know, that's not fair!

11:05.623 --> 11:07.917
No, that's not fair!

11:08.000 --> 11:11.629
All right, two years ago I bit off a nose.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.631
That's one lousy nose!

11:13.714 --> 11:16.759
I'm branded for life here!
"Belker the biter."

11:16.842 --> 11:19.553
Do you think I don't know
what I'm called behind my back?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.264
Do you think I don't know?

11:22.348 --> 11:24.558
(chattering continues)

11:28.521 --> 11:30.147
Take it easy. Take it easy.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.982
Nobody's gonna hurt you. Ya hear me?

11:32.066 --> 11:33.984
We're gonna take you to the hospital now.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.445
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you, huh?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.781
Don't think I don't know
who was copping the cheap feel

11:38.864 --> 11:41.367
during the fight, huh? Let's go. Let's go.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.119
Come on, baby. You're okay, honey.

11:43.202 --> 11:46.414
-You're okay, kid. Hold onto me.
-I got him back here.

11:46.497 --> 11:50.000
-Hold right onto me. That's good.
-Get his head. Lucy, get his head.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.588
MAN: Can we make some room here?
Coming through here now.

11:54.672 --> 11:57.466
Bad scene.
Sorry you had to see it come down.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.928
You certainly did your part to help out.

12:01.011 --> 12:04.306
I'm undercover.
Hey, look, this is a war zone here, huh?

12:04.390 --> 12:06.392
Come on. Let's talk about you.

12:07.184 --> 12:10.020
What are you like when you,
uh, let your hair down?

12:10.104 --> 12:11.689
My hair is down.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.943
HILL: Yeah, she's a special woman, Cowboy.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.237
RENKO: They all are
for the first six weeks.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.572
You know, huh?

12:19.655 --> 12:22.408
You've never stuck
with one woman for six hours.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.827
Well, they can't handle me
any longer than that.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.080
What about these kids?
Don't that bother you?

12:28.164 --> 12:30.207
Well, I thought it might, but it doesn't.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.709
It's like they're my own.

12:32.626 --> 12:35.546
Well, I always hate to see
a good animal get his spirit broke.

12:35.629 --> 12:36.756
(chuckles)

12:37.757 --> 12:39.508
(dispatcher indistinct)

12:39.592 --> 12:43.012
-RENKO: Uh-oh.
-Let's hit it!

12:43.095 --> 12:46.932
-(siren wailing)
-(upbeat music playing)

12:47.016 --> 12:48.559
(tires screeching)

12:51.687 --> 12:53.272
Stay down there, Renko!

12:53.355 --> 12:54.857
All right, you boys in there,

12:54.940 --> 12:57.151
now you come out
with your hands held high!

12:58.944 --> 13:01.614
-I don't think they heard me.
-Get that feeling, do you?

13:01.697 --> 13:03.199
I said come out!

13:06.035 --> 13:08.120
-(shouts)
-Mama bless me!

13:11.624 --> 13:15.252
It may or may not be
a hostage situation in that liquor store.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.255
-We don't know that yet, Commander.
-We're still sealing the zone.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.341
And we won't know that
until we've interfaced

13:20.424 --> 13:22.092
with the perpetrators.

13:25.554 --> 13:28.349
-(siren wailing)
-MAN: I don't want anybody hurt here!

13:28.432 --> 13:29.600
Move back!

13:40.736 --> 13:41.695
Hello, operator?

13:41.779 --> 13:44.323
This is Detective Henry Goldblume,
Hill Street Station.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.408
We have an emergency situation here.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.118
Would you please…

13:48.202 --> 13:52.832
please break into 555-7683

13:52.915 --> 13:54.959
and tell them that this is
a police priority call

13:55.042 --> 13:56.961
and would they please
relinquish the phone?

13:57.044 --> 13:58.921
-OPERATOR<i>: Thank you.</i>
-Thank you very much.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.048
Can you believe this?

14:01.799 --> 14:03.384
-Yeah?
<i>-You're gonna have to hang up,</i>

14:03.467 --> 14:04.593
<i>and he'll call you back.</i>

14:04.677 --> 14:07.304
-Thank you.
-(phone rings)

14:07.388 --> 14:08.889
-Yeah?
<i>-Yes, that'll be--</i>

14:08.973 --> 14:10.850
-How much?
<i>-Ten cents.</i>

14:15.312 --> 14:17.857
Are you teething,
or are you just stopping smoking?

14:17.940 --> 14:20.025
My two-year-old is stopping smoking.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.237
<i>-Thank you.</i>
-You're welcome.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.991
DISPATCHER: <i>This is Hill Street.</i>
<i>We need a status report. Over.</i>

14:27.074 --> 14:30.619
Yeah, we got six units on the scene now,
but we're gonna need some crowd control.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.580
We got about 100 people out here already.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.665
Say, what's happening
with that hostage squad?

14:34.748 --> 14:36.125
What are they waiting for? Over.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.085
<i>-On their way.</i>
-All right.

14:38.168 --> 14:41.005
<i>-Ten-four.</i>
-(siren wailing)

14:45.342 --> 14:47.845
(indistinct shouting)

14:54.685 --> 14:56.687
(growling)

15:02.234 --> 15:05.070
You hold it right there, hairy!

15:05.154 --> 15:07.781
-(grunts)
-MAN: Move it back!

15:09.658 --> 15:12.286
Listen, lover, let's get outta here

15:12.369 --> 15:15.497
before every dealer
in the neighborhood sees us, hmm?

15:15.581 --> 15:17.917
(siren wailing)

15:19.335 --> 15:20.461
Any luck getting through?

15:20.544 --> 15:23.005
They're talking to the media.
They won't get off the phone.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.841
It's a zoo out there.
Crowd's getting bigger. People everywhere.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.760
We're gonna have a wreck.
No doubt about it.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.762
-(phone rings)
-Yeah? Detective Goldblume.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.556
What's the deal, huh? You don't come
busting into my line, you dig?

15:32.640 --> 15:34.475
Look, I've been talking
to the media, you know,

15:34.558 --> 15:36.018
and they know what's going down here.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.978
So you don't try
and jerk me around, you understand?

15:38.062 --> 15:40.439
'Cause I'm negotiating
the rights to my life story.

15:40.522 --> 15:43.859
Yeah, okay. Just talk to me
and we'll sort this thing out, son.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.570
-Call me Henry. What's your name?
-Why? (laughs)

15:46.654 --> 15:49.198
-You wanna take me out on a date?
-How old are you?

15:49.281 --> 15:51.533
I can't hear you.
There's too much static on this line.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.410
You gotta talk up louder, man.

15:53.494 --> 15:57.164
-How old are you?
-(speaking Spanish)

15:57.247 --> 15:59.708
(Spanish continues)

15:59.792 --> 16:02.127
Listen, son, nobody's been hurt yet,

16:02.211 --> 16:04.755
so if you come out right now,
we can go somewhere and talk.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.006
Man, the hell with that.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.968
You just get me Jesus Martinez
on this phone now, you dig?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.135
Who's Jesus Martinez?

16:10.219 --> 16:12.179
He's talking about
the warlord of Los Diablos.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.640
-Find him.
-Come on, man. Don't give me that.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.308
You don't know who Jesus Martinez is?

16:16.392 --> 16:18.894
<i>-Meantime, keep this line open.</i>
-Damn, man, you're stupid.

16:18.978 --> 16:19.979
You don't know nothing!

16:20.062 --> 16:21.897
Keep the flow of dialogue.
Know what I mean?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.983
Maybe you can tell me
what's troubling you.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.070
What's troubling me, huh?
Well, what's troubling me is you, chump.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.363
(kisses)

16:29.446 --> 16:33.283
-(indistinct chattering)
-(sighs)

16:34.868 --> 16:36.870
How the hell can I create
an ambience of trust

16:36.954 --> 16:38.330
under these conditions?

16:38.956 --> 16:41.166
I don't like the term EATer, Frank.
It's offensive.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.003
-I wouldn't take it so personally, Howard.
-It's more than that--

16:44.086 --> 16:45.963
Emergency Action Team
takes too long to say.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.381
What's the scenario out there?

16:47.464 --> 16:50.426
We've got a couple of Puerto Ricans
holding hostages in a liquor store

16:50.509 --> 16:53.220
in the 1800 block of Dekker Avenue.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.139
Well, just say the word, and we'll deploy.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.849
I'm sending in Goldblume.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.810
See if we can open communication,
diffuse the situation.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.895
-It's by the book, Howard.
-Goldblume!

17:01.979 --> 17:04.648
Goldblume couldn't diffuse
a roll of kosher toilet paper.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.484
-If you get my thrust.
-That's not necessarily accurate, Howard.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.362
-I've seen the man work.
-Could I say something here?

17:10.446 --> 17:12.364
Phil, Ray, do you mind?

17:12.448 --> 17:14.324
Could I have the floor here for a second?

17:14.408 --> 17:15.784
-Howard.
-Please, Frank,

17:15.868 --> 17:17.578
we're in a discretionary situation.

17:17.661 --> 17:20.122
I'd hate to have it said that
we had the manpower available

17:20.205 --> 17:22.041
and chose to underreact.

17:22.124 --> 17:25.085
Let me spell it out for you.
You've got a dangerous number

17:25.169 --> 17:27.629
of environmentally handicapped types
out there.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.382
Two hours from now,
that number's gonna quadruple.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.301
-What's your point, Howard?
-The point is

17:32.384 --> 17:34.970
that I would like free reign
to neutralize that liquor store.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.346
Make an example of it.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.016
Don't hamstring us, Frank.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.602
My guys need the validation.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.564
Don't get sucked into a riot situation.
You're too nice a guy.

17:50.694 --> 17:53.155
All right, go down there. Low profile.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.574
But I don't want you taking
anything into your own hands

17:55.657 --> 17:58.243
unless you get a direct order
from me, you got that?

17:58.827 --> 18:01.330
(exhales) It's your precinct.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.123
I appreciate that, Howard.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.089
It's a gut check, Frank.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.758
And you wouldn't wanna be
accused of having a bunch of daisies

18:12.841 --> 18:14.510
where your cinch belt ought to be.

18:15.677 --> 18:18.097
Well, why don't you go
down there and tell those kids--

18:18.180 --> 18:19.932
Six more units, rooftop surveillance--

18:20.015 --> 18:21.850
I really hate you, Frank!

18:21.934 --> 18:23.644
Hello, Fay.

18:23.727 --> 18:26.313
You know, this place stinks!
It makes me nauseous.

18:26.396 --> 18:29.358
You remember Phil Esterhaus
and Ray Calletano?

18:29.441 --> 18:31.902
Frank, the check bounced.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.695
-What?
-Not only that,

18:33.779 --> 18:36.406
but you brought Frank Jr. home
from the hockey game last night

18:36.490 --> 18:37.699
with a 102 fever.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.036
-Where's your brain?
-Fay, I'm in the middle of a crisis here.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.288
You bet you are! My crisis!

18:43.872 --> 18:45.874
Your son is home sick.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.002
Now I gotta get someone to stay
with him so I can go to work.

18:49.086 --> 18:52.548
But because your lousy check
bounced higher than a handball,

18:52.631 --> 18:54.424
I can't pay the sitter!

18:55.425 --> 18:57.177
I really hate your guts, Frank.

18:57.261 --> 19:00.139
This marriage
and everything connected with it

19:00.222 --> 19:02.099
has caused me nothing but grief!

19:02.891 --> 19:04.518
And on top of that,

19:05.144 --> 19:10.149
Harvey says Frank Jr.'s got some
sort of gender identity thing

19:10.232 --> 19:13.026
that he's got to work through
because his father is a cop!

19:14.236 --> 19:17.072
He's getting into fights
in school because of it.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.201
And everything is just lousy!

19:21.285 --> 19:23.579
-Phil--
-And it is all your lousy fault!

19:23.662 --> 19:25.581
Phil, would you please take Fay out

19:25.664 --> 19:27.541
to the coffee bar
for just a couple of minutes

19:27.624 --> 19:30.210
while I coordinate
a few things with Ray here.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.213
-Fay--
-Then I'll take care of the situation.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.181
I'm sorry you had to witness that.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.390
No sweat, man.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.393
We've all been there.

19:47.728 --> 19:48.937
Ex-wives.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.606
Yeah.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.357
Except she's right.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.444
I shouldn't have taken him
to the hockey game.

19:56.403 --> 19:58.655
Sometimes I miss him so much, it hurts.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.867
PHIL: Fay, cream and sugar?

20:05.621 --> 20:06.997
(crying)

20:16.089 --> 20:17.674
Hey, how you been, Fay?

20:19.509 --> 20:20.594
Good.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.305
How are you, Phil?

20:23.388 --> 20:25.557
How's, um, Margaret?

20:26.141 --> 20:28.060
Well, didn't Frank tell you?

20:28.143 --> 20:29.561
We split up.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.897
(sighs)

20:31.980 --> 20:33.523
I'm sorry.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.443
I'm-- You guys were married forever.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.653
23 years.

20:38.695 --> 20:41.323
Oh, I'm really sorry, Phil.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.616
Well, don't be.

20:42.699 --> 20:44.618
To tell you the truth,
I've never been happier.

20:44.701 --> 20:47.955
Now, granted, I hit the skids
real hard for a ten-month period.

20:48.038 --> 20:50.249
I mean, I came close to ending it.

20:52.042 --> 20:53.627
But then I met Cindy,

20:53.710 --> 20:56.171
and overnight my life turned around.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.923
-(laughs)
-Oh, yeah?

20:58.006 --> 21:00.384
Oh, that's terrific.
I'm glad to hear that.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.053
Are you thinking of getting remarried?

21:03.136 --> 21:05.889
As soon as she graduates.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.599
She's a college student?

21:09.226 --> 21:12.854
High school. She's a graduating senior.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.151
(crying continues)

21:20.988 --> 21:22.406
BELKER: Come on! Come on!

21:23.323 --> 21:24.491
Down here!

21:25.325 --> 21:26.618
Move! Move!

21:35.419 --> 21:37.879
You wanna sit down there
before I knock you down?

21:42.718 --> 21:46.430
Hey, I need a nurse.
This lunatic bit me on my damn ankle!

21:48.140 --> 21:49.141
Name.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.603
I said name!

21:54.396 --> 21:56.606
Wilson, Richard T.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.859
(indistinct chattering)

22:02.195 --> 22:04.531
(phone rings)

22:06.450 --> 22:07.868
Detective Belker.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.913
-Hi, Ma.
<i>-</i>WOMAN (oh phone): <i>What is that noise?</i>

22:11.997 --> 22:13.707
I'm, uh, typing.

22:13.790 --> 22:16.835
(Mrs. Belker on the phone, indistinct)

22:17.461 --> 22:18.754
I stopped. I'm listening.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.256
(Mrs. Belker continues, indistinct)

22:22.799 --> 22:25.427
That's it? He wants to go to Florida?

22:26.303 --> 22:28.889
Why-- Why is that such a bad thing?

22:31.058 --> 22:33.769
The man is 83, Ma!
Who is he gonna have an affair with?

22:33.852 --> 22:35.395
(chuckles)

22:37.022 --> 22:38.732
So you know what you'll do?

22:38.815 --> 22:41.818
You'll go with him,
and you'll be able to keep an eye on him.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.114
That's silly, Ma. Yes, it is!

22:46.198 --> 22:48.575
You look great in a bathing suit.
You got a great shape--

22:52.579 --> 22:56.333
You better wipe that smirk
right off your face!

23:02.005 --> 23:04.674
What am I hearing now?
I know I'm hearing crying.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.551
There's no crying now.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.096
We made a deal. No crying.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.223
Come on. Ma?

23:13.517 --> 23:15.018
I gotta call you back, sweetheart.

23:15.811 --> 23:16.937
(no audible dialogue)

23:17.771 --> 23:18.814
What?

23:25.862 --> 23:27.322
I'll call the bank.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.700
They'll have the cash to cover the check
by the time you get there.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.994
-I promise.
-And what about the session with Harvey?

23:33.078 --> 23:36.081
I'd love to have a sit-down
with you and Harvey about Frank Jr.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.207
When?

23:37.290 --> 23:39.793
I'll call his office
as soon as I can, Fay.

23:39.876 --> 23:41.378
When?

23:41.461 --> 23:44.381
Don't you think
it's a little unprofessional

23:44.464 --> 23:46.591
to take the kid to a shrink
and then date him?

23:46.675 --> 23:49.177
-We have been through that.
-Are you sleeping with him?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.512
That's none of your business.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.472
I'm concerned about my son's environment.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.475
Let me tell you something
about your son's environment.

23:55.559 --> 23:58.145
It improved the moment you left the house!

24:02.065 --> 24:03.191
Yo, Louie.

24:04.192 --> 24:07.696
Look, my 11:00 is here.
We'll get together, okay?

24:10.740 --> 24:12.284
Can I help you, gentlemen?

24:12.367 --> 24:15.370
Yeah. We were summoned by Captain Furillo.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.205
Captain Furillo?

24:17.289 --> 24:19.249
It's okay, Phil. Let 'em through.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.752
This? This is your 11:00 appointment?

24:22.836 --> 24:23.920
That's right.

24:26.256 --> 24:28.383
Yo, mama, where's the party?

24:28.467 --> 24:31.219
Hey, Louie. (speaking Spanish)

24:32.762 --> 24:35.223
Whoa! Touchy, Frankie. Touchy.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.726
All right. Mm.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.353
It's really the big-time, Frank.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.917
(phone ringing)

25:02.000 --> 25:04.419
They didn't have ribs,
so we had to go for chicken.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.048
I hope that don't mess up détente.

25:08.131 --> 25:11.301
Détente? Hmm.

25:19.267 --> 25:23.063
(clears throat) Brunch, Francis.

25:24.272 --> 25:25.565
Thank you, Phil.

25:37.077 --> 25:40.247
-Thank you, Phil.
-You're very welcome, Francis.

25:44.459 --> 25:46.795
-(door closes)
-Yo.

25:50.757 --> 25:53.635
Furillo, what makes you think
I wanna get involved here?

25:53.718 --> 25:56.137
Because one hand washes the other, Jesus.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.931
I do for you. You do for me.

25:58.014 --> 26:00.892
Yeah? And what've you done
for me lately, huh?

26:00.976 --> 26:02.894
You set up peace talk with the Dragons.

26:02.978 --> 26:05.063
Poof-butts don't even show their face.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.233
And whose fault was that?
Lover boy's over there.

26:08.316 --> 26:09.568
You got a short memory.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.861
You set it up, bro!

26:11.945 --> 26:13.613
You make me look bad.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.949
Now, why the hell should
I make you look good, huh?

26:16.032 --> 26:18.118
It's got nothing to do
with making me look good!

26:18.201 --> 26:20.203
Those are innocent people
in that liquor store,

26:20.287 --> 26:23.748
and the agreement we negotiated
was you don't hit stores on Dragon turf.

26:24.457 --> 26:27.294
Dekker Avenue is D.M.Z., Frankie!

26:27.377 --> 26:28.795
You know that.

26:28.878 --> 26:31.798
-(door opens)
-Francis, your wife's on the phone.

26:31.881 --> 26:34.968
-Please, Phil, later.
-"Please, Phil, later."

26:35.051 --> 26:37.512
(laughs) You're wicked, bro.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.931
I mean, you really know
how to run a business here.

26:40.015 --> 26:42.183
Frank, we don't have to put up with this.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.561
-Easy, Ray. Sit down. Sit!
-Sit.

26:44.644 --> 26:45.729
Phil.

26:54.487 --> 26:56.489
-(door closes)
-So what's it gonna be?

26:56.573 --> 26:58.533
You gonna help us,
or do some people get killed?

27:00.368 --> 27:02.454
-What's my sugar?
-What do you want?

27:03.079 --> 27:04.080
Louie.

27:09.544 --> 27:11.463
One pump-action shotgun,

27:11.546 --> 27:13.548
two Smith &amp; Wesson .38's,

27:13.632 --> 27:17.218
half a dozen flak jackets,
and a tear gas gun.

27:17.302 --> 27:20.555
How about some T-shirts
with "Los Diablos" on the front?

27:20.639 --> 27:22.724
Three colors.
You can design them yourself.

27:22.807 --> 27:25.727
Oh, wow. T-shirts. (laughs)

27:28.104 --> 27:29.606
One flak jacket

27:29.689 --> 27:33.610
and a cop car to take my mother
to the clinic on 145th Street

27:33.693 --> 27:35.570
every Tuesday afternoon.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.989
Poor woman's scared to go by herself.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.617
And 'cause of that treaty
we signed con Los Conquistadores,

27:40.700 --> 27:42.369
I can't go with her myself.

27:44.829 --> 27:47.082
-You serious?
-Yeah.

27:48.541 --> 27:52.087
-Can we live with that?
-Sure. Why not?

27:52.837 --> 27:54.047
Done.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.340
Yo.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.888
Yo, Brother Ray, can you
get me my phone, please?

28:04.849 --> 28:07.936
MAN: <i>All right, people, please back up.</i>
<i>Back up, please.</i>

28:08.019 --> 28:10.980
BOY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The hostages are okay, right?

28:11.064 --> 28:12.482
Better than us.

28:12.565 --> 28:15.151
We just can't walk outta here.
You know that.

28:15.235 --> 28:16.820
Sure you can, Hector.

28:16.903 --> 28:18.863
All you gotta do is walk. That's all.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.782
<i>Trust me. Trust me, all right.</i>

28:20.865 --> 28:23.410
Don't go off the deep end.
They're not stupid.

28:23.493 --> 28:25.912
Look, man, we're in this mess
because of you, all right?

28:25.995 --> 28:29.708
I mean, you want us to come out
with nothing, hey, that's one thing.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.710
But just remember it was your idea!

28:31.793 --> 28:34.796
(shouting in Spanish)

28:34.879 --> 28:36.589
Looking to make me an accessory!

28:36.673 --> 28:38.466
I'd like to interject
something here, Captain.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.510
Who's that on the line?

28:40.593 --> 28:41.845
It's Goldblume, Frank.

28:41.928 --> 28:44.347
Listen, I'd like to point out
to Hector that as a juvenile

28:44.431 --> 28:46.307
the charges might be considerably reduced.

28:46.391 --> 28:49.269
Yeah, man, I don't know.
The same thing got told to Papo last year.

28:49.352 --> 28:50.353
You know what happened?

28:50.437 --> 28:52.355
His mother told the judge
she didn't want him.

28:52.439 --> 28:53.815
They sent him away, yeah!

28:53.898 --> 28:56.276
(Spanish) And you better
not make a liar out of me.

28:56.359 --> 28:57.193
Yeah, but, uh...

28:57.277 --> 28:59.154
What's going on?
What're they saying down there?

28:59.237 --> 29:01.448
Take me, man? Well, then,
just come down here and try it!

29:01.531 --> 29:04.784
Yeah? (shouts in Spanish)
You hear that? You're dead meat!

29:04.868 --> 29:06.453
Rats are gonna eat your eyes!

29:06.536 --> 29:08.121
Hector, don't hang up. Hector!

29:08.830 --> 29:10.540
I wanna talk to my mother, okay, Frankie?

29:10.623 --> 29:13.042
I wanna know if she's gonna send
me to some home or farm or what!

29:13.126 --> 29:15.628
-What's going on?
-Back off!

29:15.712 --> 29:17.672
Captain, this is Hunter at the scene.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.424
Get off the line, Howard.

29:19.507 --> 29:21.968
Listen to me, Frank.
You're making a grave error here.

29:22.051 --> 29:25.054
We've got the firepower
to blow these punks out of the water.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.848
Go ahead and try it, okay!

29:26.931 --> 29:29.017
I'll kill the woman first, you dig?

29:29.100 --> 29:30.977
Hang up the phone, Howard!
That's an order!

29:31.060 --> 29:32.520
HUNTER: <i>We are so damn intimidated</i>

29:32.604 --> 29:34.939
by these minority action groups
and political cowards.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.649
-Howard--
-We wind up doing nothing.

29:36.733 --> 29:39.694
-Give me the phone, Sergeant.
-It's no wonder this country is rotting.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.783
Hey, I kiss your mother four times!

29:44.866 --> 29:46.659
(shouts in Spanish)

29:46.743 --> 29:49.078
-Try it!
-(nightstick slams)

29:49.162 --> 29:50.038
You're dead, Jesus!

29:50.121 --> 29:52.415
I'm gonna put a hole
in your head, sucker! You're dead!

29:52.499 --> 29:53.541
Get outta here.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.045
Hey, no more favors.

29:57.128 --> 29:59.506
I can't work with this "gar-bahge."

30:02.383 --> 30:03.843
What? Huh?

30:05.637 --> 30:08.181
You people should take showers!
Whoa, mama--

30:09.599 --> 30:11.059
What? What?

30:11.768 --> 30:12.852
(kicks can)

30:13.770 --> 30:16.314
I really want you
to hear this now, Hector.

30:16.397 --> 30:18.149
You gotta work with me on this.

30:18.233 --> 30:21.736
You gotta keep things cool in there
while I keep things cool out here.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.947
It's no easy situation,
I'm gonna tell you.

30:24.030 --> 30:26.032
My head is busting, Frank.
My head is busting.

30:26.115 --> 30:28.785
I don't know what it is.
It's the tension. I don't know, you know?

30:28.868 --> 30:30.703
Hey, I'm sorry.

30:30.787 --> 30:32.372
You gotta have some aspirin in there.

30:32.455 --> 30:34.207
Take a couple of aspirin.
You'll feel better.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.835
They don't do no good, man.
They don't do no good!

30:36.918 --> 30:40.171
Oh, well, no problem.
I'll bring something with me.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.382
I'm gonna put Ray Calletano
on the phone now

30:43.258 --> 30:45.343
while I drive over there, like we agreed.

30:45.426 --> 30:47.428
-He's a good guy, you know?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.014
What about that dude that said
he was gonna blow us all up?

30:50.098 --> 30:52.892
-Who is that chump? Huh?
-<i>Don't worry about him, man, really.</i>

30:52.976 --> 30:54.727
You just stay cool. I'm on my way.

30:55.645 --> 30:58.356
Hey, Hector, this is Ray, man. Your bro.

30:58.439 --> 31:01.317
(speaking Spanish)

31:02.652 --> 31:04.404
Esterhaus here. Get me Dispatch.

31:04.487 --> 31:06.531
Anybody locate that guy
we lost this morning?

31:06.614 --> 31:08.366
At this point in time, not as yet.

31:08.449 --> 31:09.617
I got a domestic beef:

31:09.701 --> 31:11.619
woman threatening her daughter
with a knife.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.621
Yeah, this is Detective LaRue,
Hill Street.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.332
-Is Miss Davenport in?
-1084 119th Street.

31:16.416 --> 31:19.627
Look, pull Hill and Renko off
that liquor store. Thanks.

31:19.711 --> 31:23.089
Hi. John LaRue.
About that missing suspect of yours.

31:23.172 --> 31:26.926
They, uh, just brought him in.
Yeah, some kind of a mix-up.

31:27.010 --> 31:30.555
Anyway, I thought you'd wanna
hotfoot it down here and spring him.

31:30.638 --> 31:33.433
Hey, that's okay. My pleasure.

31:33.516 --> 31:35.768
Sure. Bye.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.312
I don't believe this.

31:37.395 --> 31:40.064
You know, you're crazy. Outta your mind.

31:40.815 --> 31:42.442
-It's 4:00 now, right?
-Mm-hmm.

31:42.525 --> 31:44.527
By the time she gets here, it's 5:00.

31:44.611 --> 31:48.781
By the time she figures
it's a wild goose chase, it's 5:30.

31:48.865 --> 31:51.492
So she chews out Furillo for 15 minutes.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.953
That makes it a quarter to 6:00.
Then it's time.

31:55.955 --> 31:58.917
Joyce, I'm-- I'm sorry about the mix-up.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.294
I feel terrible.

32:02.128 --> 32:04.923
Hey, I'll tell you what.
Let me make it up to you.

32:05.006 --> 32:07.926
We'll swing by my place.
I'll get into some fresh rags.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.345
We'll go over to Pierre's
for drinks and dinner.

32:11.888 --> 32:14.891
Tell you what, slick.
If she turns you down...

32:14.974 --> 32:16.643
-Mm-hmm?
-...you can take me.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.978
(laughing)

32:19.062 --> 32:22.065
-(siren wailing)
-(tires squeaking)

32:23.942 --> 32:25.234
(indistinct shouting)

32:25.318 --> 32:27.779
All right, ma'am,
y'all are gonna have to open up this door,

32:27.862 --> 32:30.156
-or we're gonna boot it in.
-(shouting continues)

32:30.239 --> 32:32.492
-Blow the door?
-Yeah.

32:35.370 --> 32:38.122
-Hold it right there!
-(shouting)

32:39.540 --> 32:42.877
-Nobody's gonna kill anybody!
-I wouldn't count on that!

32:42.961 --> 32:46.506
Okay, lady. All right, lady.
Look, how about putting down that knife

32:46.589 --> 32:48.383
and letting her cover up
her this and that,

32:48.466 --> 32:52.011
-and then we can talk about the problem.
-The problem is her this and that!

32:52.095 --> 32:53.805
He said if I didn't let him, he'd beat me!

32:53.888 --> 32:56.599
MAN: I never said that. She asked for it.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.897
Who is that standing in there?

33:03.439 --> 33:05.650
That's my husband, William.

33:05.733 --> 33:08.236
If he comes outta there,
I'm gonna cut him, too!

33:08.319 --> 33:10.947
Uh, Bill, I think you better
stay in there for a minute.

33:11.030 --> 33:14.993
Now, what we have here is statutory rape,

33:15.076 --> 33:18.121
possession of a deadly weapon,
intent to use a deadly weapon.

33:18.204 --> 33:21.040
-I think we oughta run them all in.
-Hold it. Hold it, Renko.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.959
(sighs)

33:23.042 --> 33:26.379
Look, if you put down the knife,
we can work it out.

33:26.462 --> 33:29.632
Otherwise, I'm not gonna
be able to keep this white man off of you.

33:30.216 --> 33:31.801
I'm counting to three.

33:32.844 --> 33:33.845
One.

33:36.472 --> 33:37.765
Two.

33:40.476 --> 33:44.439
Okay. Okay, okay! All right, hold it!

33:44.522 --> 33:46.482
-Okay, okay.
-(mutters)

33:50.653 --> 33:52.447
Okay, William, you can come out.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.288
You okay, Mama?

34:00.872 --> 34:02.790
Don't you Mama me. I'll break your back.

34:02.874 --> 34:06.044
-(shouting)
-Hey, hold it! Are you the girl's father?

34:06.627 --> 34:09.172
Of course not!
What kind of man do you think I am?

34:09.255 --> 34:11.883
You ain't no kinda man at all!
That's what kinda man you are!

34:11.966 --> 34:13.843
She runs around half-naked all the time!

34:13.926 --> 34:15.762
-What do you expect?
-Well, don't blame me!

34:15.845 --> 34:17.930
I got to sleep on the couch.
I got nowhere to go.

34:18.014 --> 34:22.560
Besides, you're always talking about
how Mama don't give you what you need.

34:23.686 --> 34:25.146
You said that?

34:25.229 --> 34:28.066
Well, you run hot and cold on me
all the time, woman.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.735
William, I am on my feet ten hours a day!

34:30.818 --> 34:33.780
-Well, I work hard, too!
-Of course you do. You both do.

34:33.863 --> 34:35.740
But that won't solve the problem.

34:35.823 --> 34:39.285
You get that-- that girl outta here,
and we don't have no problem.

34:39.368 --> 34:42.246
Oh, yeah? You break up this family,
and you got nothing.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.874
Is that what you all want?

34:45.458 --> 34:47.794
Huh? Is that what you want?

34:47.877 --> 34:50.338
Him in jail, her in a home,
you with nothing?

34:53.049 --> 34:55.927
Okay, okay,
this is the law for this house!

34:56.010 --> 34:58.805
William, when you're in the house alone,
you stay away from her!

34:58.888 --> 35:01.891
You understand?
You don't cohabit with your stepdaughter!

35:01.974 --> 35:04.185
It ain't no habit. We only done it once!

35:04.268 --> 35:06.229
-That's not true!
-You mean to tell me--

35:06.312 --> 35:08.189
Shut up! And you, little lady,

35:09.190 --> 35:11.609
when you're in the bathroom
changing your clothes,

35:11.692 --> 35:13.069
you keep the door shut.

35:14.153 --> 35:17.365
Mama, Mama, you gotta make yourself
more available to William.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.867
All he wants
is a little attention from his woman.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.412
William, you know I love you.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.624
You gotta show it more, Mama.

35:27.583 --> 35:29.502
Okay, this is the law.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.508
You all take care now, all right?

35:37.885 --> 35:39.178
Let's go, Renko.

35:42.265 --> 35:44.892
RENKO: All right, people, you mind
your own business now and go home.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.395
As long as I live,
I'll never understand people like this.

35:47.478 --> 35:48.312
Say what?

35:48.396 --> 35:50.815
That's one of them local
colloquialisms, isn't it?

35:50.898 --> 35:53.526
-"Say what?" What is it?
-Say what? (laughs)

35:53.609 --> 35:56.863
You're just passing them laws out
right and left, ain't you, judge?

35:56.946 --> 35:59.323
That I do, son. That I do.

36:01.534 --> 36:02.702
The car...

36:03.536 --> 36:05.788
Oh, Ma, they stole my car.

36:07.039 --> 36:09.417
That's a brand-new unit. Second one today.

36:10.209 --> 36:11.294
I'll tell you something.

36:11.377 --> 36:14.130
If I have to shoot up this whole street,
I'm gonna get that car back.

36:14.213 --> 36:16.299
There ain't no way
I'm gonna file a report on this.

36:16.382 --> 36:18.176
-Okay, okay. Take it easy.
-No way at all!

36:18.259 --> 36:21.512
-We don't wanna collect a crowd.
-A crowd? A crowd!

36:21.596 --> 36:24.015
Well, that's exactly what
I want to do is collect--

36:24.098 --> 36:26.142
Renko, we lose two
or three cars every month.

36:26.225 --> 36:28.603
-Don't you Renko me.
-When they park 'em, they leave 'em.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.146
-No big deal.
-It's a big deal to me.

36:30.229 --> 36:32.273
That's the second unit today,
a brand-new unit.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.817
-Esterhaus is gonna kill me!
-Renko, shut up!

36:34.901 --> 36:37.987
Now we have no car,
and we have no radio, man.

36:38.070 --> 36:39.739
So let's just be cool.

36:39.822 --> 36:42.074
Let's just call in and get another unit.

36:42.158 --> 36:44.911
Dead phone! Look at this mess!

36:44.994 --> 36:47.330
Look at this!

36:48.497 --> 36:49.749
(sighs)

36:49.832 --> 36:51.834
Hey, man, the world's full of phones, man.

36:51.918 --> 36:53.669
Lots of phones. Let's go find one.

36:54.712 --> 36:57.590
Hey, don't you squinny
your eyes at me like that!

36:57.673 --> 36:59.884
I'm a peace officer,
and I want you off this street

36:59.967 --> 37:01.969
when I get back! And I mean it!

37:02.595 --> 37:04.597
I'm so tired of dealing
with people like this

37:04.680 --> 37:06.140
every single day of my life.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.310
(indistinct chattering)

37:09.393 --> 37:11.896
-Hey, man! Get outta here!
-Come on! Move!

37:20.112 --> 37:21.781
(gunshots)

37:22.573 --> 37:27.411
(dramatic music playing)

37:47.348 --> 37:49.934
-MAN: Just disperse, please.
-(siren wailing)

37:50.017 --> 37:51.560
Nothing is gonna happen here.

37:51.644 --> 37:55.523
-(siren wailing)
-(tires squeaking)

37:55.606 --> 37:58.234
Folks, we'd like to get
your cooperation here.

37:58.317 --> 38:00.027
Please stand behind the barricades.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.947
Get those helicopters outta here.
I can't hear myself think.

38:03.030 --> 38:05.449
GOLDBLUME: Frank, I wanna make
a statement for the record.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.995
-Get outta here.
-GOLDBLUME: Can you hear me, Frank?

38:09.078 --> 38:12.456
-FRANK: No. Get them outta here now.
-GOLDBLUME: Frank!

38:12.540 --> 38:15.001
Put that shotgun down.
Get it out of sight.

38:15.751 --> 38:17.670
Holster those weapons. That's an order.

38:17.753 --> 38:19.255
Put 'em away, now!

38:20.923 --> 38:22.550
Give me that. Give it to me!

38:24.385 --> 38:27.221
You in the liquor store! Hector!

38:27.305 --> 38:29.557
This is Captain Furillo.

38:29.640 --> 38:33.102
First thing I want you to do
is acknowledge you can hear me.

38:35.021 --> 38:36.605
Toss something out the door.

38:36.689 --> 38:39.275
MAN: Folks, we can't have you
standing in this area over here.

38:39.358 --> 38:40.985
We're gonna have to move you on back.

38:41.068 --> 38:43.612
WOMAN: (startles) Oh, my God. (laughs)

38:44.822 --> 38:47.283
(crowd cheering, laughing)

38:54.874 --> 38:57.460
Okay, well done, Hector.

38:58.377 --> 39:01.005
Now, I'm gonna come over
to your side of the street now.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.925
Are you still listening, Hector?

39:05.551 --> 39:10.222
Pull those helicopters out of here!
We can't hear! What?

39:14.143 --> 39:17.188
MAN: Can I get a couple of officers
over here to move these people back?

39:17.271 --> 39:19.857
(helicopter noise)

39:23.778 --> 39:26.197
I'm gonna come as far as the curb.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.575
All you have to do
is open the door a little so we can rap.

39:29.658 --> 39:31.243
Hector-- (speaking Spanish)

39:35.956 --> 39:39.210
<i>You can see I'm unarmed.</i>
<i>Can you hear me, Hector?</i>

39:52.973 --> 39:56.852
Just take those helicopters outta here!

39:56.936 --> 40:00.231
(very loud helicopter noise)

41:19.310 --> 41:21.061
Hector! Abajo!

41:24.231 --> 41:27.276
(objects breaking, glass shattering)

41:43.000 --> 41:44.793
(shooting stops)

42:02.603 --> 42:05.689
Frank, Frank, take a Valium.

42:15.115 --> 42:17.159
MAN: You ruin my business! You crazy!

42:17.243 --> 42:19.036
Better the kids!

42:19.119 --> 42:21.539
(shouting in foreign language)

42:28.921 --> 42:31.549
I wanna run a check
on that man's immigration status.

42:31.632 --> 42:33.717
-MAN: Get away from there!
-(woman yells)

42:33.801 --> 42:35.427
Move it out! Come on!

42:41.684 --> 42:44.270
No, I'm sorry, Counselor.
There must be some mistake.

42:44.353 --> 42:45.854
Your client's not here.

42:45.938 --> 42:47.690
Who said we found him?

42:47.773 --> 42:49.108
(sighs)

42:52.611 --> 42:53.988
Never mind, Sergeant.

43:08.794 --> 43:10.254
You're a real cute guy, LaRue.

43:10.838 --> 43:13.966
I mean, what else do I have to do
with my time besides waste it?

43:14.883 --> 43:17.136
(phone ringing)

43:17.845 --> 43:20.598
You know, on first instinct, I got angry.

43:22.433 --> 43:25.227
Then on second instinct,
I thought of filing charges.

43:26.645 --> 43:27.688
Really.

43:28.314 --> 43:31.775
I just wanna be with you tonight,
babe, that's all.

43:32.359 --> 43:33.527
You do, huh?

43:34.695 --> 43:36.071
Because underneath it all,

43:36.155 --> 43:39.158
you're just a lonely guy
in a dangerous job.

43:39.241 --> 43:41.702
-(sighs)
-Who am I to argue with that?

43:46.290 --> 43:48.417
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

43:49.501 --> 43:52.254
When I thought about it,
I tried to call you back.

43:52.338 --> 43:54.923
I just couldn't get through
your switchboard.

43:55.007 --> 43:56.467
(chuckles)

43:56.550 --> 43:59.261
Yeah, that's the problem
with my switchboard.

44:05.934 --> 44:07.811
No hard feelings, LaRue.

44:08.395 --> 44:10.105
You can send me the cleaning bill.

44:13.567 --> 44:14.860
Ah.

44:16.362 --> 44:18.072
Your place or mine, babe?

44:22.159 --> 44:23.827
Prisoner turn up yet, Counselor?

44:24.495 --> 44:25.704
What's with her?

44:27.122 --> 44:29.541
I don't approve of what you did, Francis.

44:30.250 --> 44:33.045
Off the record, you promised me
you'd be careful out there,

44:33.128 --> 44:35.631
-but you weren't.
-That goes double for me, Frank.

44:35.714 --> 44:37.716
You think you're still a kid or something?

44:37.800 --> 44:40.344
You got 40 phone calls here.

44:41.011 --> 44:43.138
Twenty-five of 'em are from your wife.

44:43.931 --> 44:46.809
We can't raise Hill or Renko.

44:48.018 --> 44:50.938
I sent Belker and Lamonica
out to look for them.

44:51.021 --> 44:53.816
Go home, Francis.
You look beat. Let me shop keep.

44:53.899 --> 44:57.027
Cindy's got
marching band practice till 10:00.

44:58.987 --> 45:00.739
I think I might just do that.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.787
Reactionary, fascistic,

45:06.870 --> 45:09.498
high-handed, uncaring animals!

45:10.082 --> 45:12.501
Kill, beat, intimidate,

45:12.584 --> 45:15.504
violate each and every
constitutional guarantee.

45:15.587 --> 45:18.132
Dispense curbside justice. Hmm.

45:18.215 --> 45:19.925
Uh-uh. No, sir.

45:20.008 --> 45:23.095
The problem is not
in the people in that ghetto.

45:23.178 --> 45:25.639
It's in its Nazi occupation force.

45:29.518 --> 45:30.894
Vicious, ugly.

45:30.978 --> 45:33.981
There is not a cop up there
who shouldn't be prosecuted.

45:34.648 --> 45:37.443
I swear I have seen more brutality

45:37.526 --> 45:39.570
and brazen contempt for the law

45:40.195 --> 45:42.281
to open up a grand jury investigation.

45:43.365 --> 45:44.700
I mean it.

45:47.202 --> 45:48.746
Ah. Mm.

45:49.663 --> 45:50.831
(sniffles)

45:50.914 --> 45:55.502
(melodramatic music playing)

45:57.504 --> 45:58.881
Feel better?

45:58.964 --> 46:00.340
I'm getting there.

46:04.970 --> 46:07.931
(laughs) I took half a Valium.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.934
(sighs)

46:12.603 --> 46:16.315
You care to be the, uh...

46:19.693 --> 46:20.778
the other half?

46:22.196 --> 46:24.740
-Mm-hmm.
-Hmm?

46:24.823 --> 46:27.284
-Hmm?
-Mm.

47:39.857 --> 47:43.527
-(pager beeping)
-Furillo, your pants are buzzing.

47:43.610 --> 47:44.987
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

47:47.447 --> 47:48.782
(groans)

47:57.666 --> 48:00.419
<i>-</i>FRANK (on phone): <i>It's Furillo.</i>
-It's Hill and Renko.

48:02.379 --> 48:03.964
They're both in intensive care.

48:05.424 --> 48:07.050
-(sighs)
<i>-I won't lie to you, Francis.</i>

48:07.134 --> 48:08.427
<i>It doesn't look good.</i>

48:09.094 --> 48:10.637
<i>We don't know what went down.</i>

48:17.853 --> 48:20.063
-(receiver clatters)
-(whispering) Frank?

48:26.278 --> 48:30.866
(theme music playing)
