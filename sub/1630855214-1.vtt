38:47.890 --> 38:50.110
Then you never have to worry.

38:53.156 --> 38:55.768
-Did you hear back
from immigration yet?

38:55.811 --> 38:58.161
-I have an appointment
next week.

38:58.205 --> 38:59.902
-Good.

39:02.209 --> 39:04.124
-Bueno.

39:04.167 --> 39:06.605
Okay.

39:06.648 --> 39:09.172
Your first paycheck.
Congratulations.

39:09.216 --> 39:10.913
-Thanks.

39:54.043 --> 39:55.697
-Benita, can you quickly clean

39:55.741 --> 39:58.352
the limoge tea
and coffee service

39:58.396 --> 40:00.963
and the gold rimmed
Baccarat champagne flutes,

40:01.007 --> 40:03.401
but do not place them together
because they will clash.

40:03.444 --> 40:05.968
And make sure this jewelry
is laid out on the table.

40:06.012 --> 40:07.883
-Is it a special occasion?
-Yes. Yes.

40:07.927 --> 40:09.798
Some potential new clients are
coming today,

40:09.842 --> 40:12.148
so we must have ready coffee,
tea, champagne, whiskey,

40:12.192 --> 40:14.455
whatever they require.
-Of course.

40:14.499 --> 40:18.416
-Karsavina grace, Benita.
Karsavina grace.

40:18.459 --> 40:19.895
-Yes.

40:19.939 --> 40:21.941
When -- when will they arrive?

40:21.984 --> 40:23.464
-Oh, I don't know.

40:23.508 --> 40:25.988
This pair, these clients,

40:26.032 --> 40:27.381
such people,
they never make appointments.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.991
And if they do,
they never keep them.

40:29.035 --> 40:34.606
So if they buy from us,
everyone will buy from us.

40:34.649 --> 40:36.999
So we must be ready
and waiting.

40:45.660 --> 40:50.839
Well, Benita, I think
it's time to close up shop.

40:50.883 --> 40:53.363
-Maybe we should wait
a few more minutes.

40:53.407 --> 40:57.455
-No, no, no. It's done.

40:57.498 --> 41:01.110
But tomorrow is another day.

41:05.593 --> 41:07.552
-Sorry.

41:07.595 --> 41:09.075
-It happens.

It's them!

Miss Van Der Laar!

41:21.304 --> 41:24.220
How lovely to see you.
Please come in. Come in.

41:24.264 --> 41:27.528
May I introduce my associate,
Benita Parla.

41:27.572 --> 41:31.576
[Chuckles] And, please.
Some champagne?

41:31.619 --> 41:34.709
-Yeah.
-There you are.

41:36.581 --> 41:37.625
-Thank you, Benita.

41:37.669 --> 41:40.062
-Of course.
-Thank you.

41:40.106 --> 41:42.891
-Please have a look.

41:44.893 --> 41:46.155

43:01.361 --> 43:02.928
-Let me just have
a minute to think.

43:02.971 --> 43:04.930
-Of course. Yes.

43:08.542 --> 43:14.113
Might I inquire, is it a special
occasion you're preparing for?

43:14.156 --> 43:16.855
-Oh, it's an occasion.

43:18.683 --> 43:20.423
-Uh-huh.

43:20.467 --> 43:23.078
-The museum is putting
our family name

43:23.122 --> 43:24.863
on one of their wings.

43:24.906 --> 43:30.042
And my sister is
the guest of honor.

43:30.085 --> 43:31.521
-Because of Dad.

43:31.565 --> 43:34.350
-And the museum loves you.

43:34.394 --> 43:36.483
To my dear sister Diana,

43:36.526 --> 43:40.095
who bestows this fine city
with her artistry.

43:40.139 --> 43:41.662
Cheers.

43:41.706 --> 43:43.359
-Cheers.
And congratulations.

Hmm.

44:01.421 --> 44:03.466
Oh.

44:03.510 --> 44:06.034
I think I'll do
the layering look.

44:08.123 --> 44:11.605
And I'll just get
a simpler dress.

44:11.649 --> 44:15.000
-All right. So both pieces?

44:15.043 --> 44:18.133
Benita, would you please do
the honors.

44:18.177 --> 44:19.918
And I'll do the math.
[Chuckles]

44:19.961 --> 44:24.749
And may I just say, I actually
have one of your father's prints

44:24.792 --> 44:26.141
just above my fireplace.

44:26.185 --> 44:27.534
-Oh, which one?

44:27.577 --> 44:31.103
-Uh, Tulips in March, 1991.
Beautiful.

44:31.146 --> 44:34.541
-Inspired by Diana and
their mornings at Gramercy Park.

44:34.584 --> 44:37.762
-You came, too. [Chuckles]

44:37.805 --> 44:40.852
We would go to the park
after Dad was finished painting.

44:40.895 --> 44:45.204
He would paint all night, and we
would fight over the swings.

44:45.247 --> 44:47.380
Remember, we would get
hot chocolate sometimes.

44:47.423 --> 44:48.598
-Mm-hmm.
-Do you think the place

44:48.642 --> 44:49.774
is still open?
Can we go?

-Yeah.

I've seen you before.

with, um, Aaron and Lauren.

-It was so beautiful.

45:25.548 --> 45:27.333

Didn't you raise $4 million
that night?

-Yes, uh, it I believe so.

45:34.470 --> 45:37.778
-Talented and beautiful.

-You were there, too, correct?

45:39.084 --> 45:40.607
-I was.

45:40.650 --> 45:43.479
-Well, it's been
an absolute honor serving you.

-Your tio Alvaro is very sick.

46:17.513 --> 46:20.255
We don't know
how much time he has.

46:21.866 --> 46:25.086
He was always so good to me.

46:25.130 --> 46:26.958
He would tell me
the best stories

46:27.001 --> 46:30.265
when I was a little girl
to help me fall asleep.

46:30.309 --> 46:32.572
He would pick a fight
with our father

46:32.615 --> 46:35.140
so that my father
wouldn't come after me.

46:36.619 --> 46:38.970
He was the one who helped me
to come here.

46:39.013 --> 46:42.538
He wanted a better life for you.

46:42.582 --> 46:46.151
I just want a simple life.

protect yourself.

Do you understand?

47:04.343 --> 47:05.648
-Stop!

47:08.042 --> 47:11.567
-So tell me, how was your day?

47:11.611 --> 47:12.873
-I made a sale.

-You did?!
-Mm-hmm.

It's okay.

to forget my memories.

...isn't it better
to not remember the times

47:50.519 --> 47:53.305
you were happy?

-Or better to make new ones.

working at Winshaw Kessler?

used to the smell of aged wood

in your own jewelry box.

another time when I'm there.

-What time?

48:35.477 --> 48:39.568
-Sometimes the '20s, the '50s.

48:41.353 --> 48:43.224

touch everything, right?

48:43.268 --> 48:46.924
-Yeah. And polish it.

-Wow.

when you left.

50:03.435 --> 50:06.829
-Mm. Oh, yes.

50:06.873 --> 50:08.831
I convinced them that
I was no longer dependent

50:08.875 --> 50:12.226
on the habit
of escaping my difficulties.

50:12.270 --> 50:14.663
That I had regained touch
with reality.

53:25.811 --> 53:27.813
Isn't she fabulous?

53:27.856 --> 53:29.728
-Oh, she's amazing.

53:29.771 --> 53:33.035
-I feel like I'm in
my own puppet show right now.

53:33.079 --> 53:34.341
[Laughs]

53:34.385 --> 53:35.647
You need a drink?

53:35.690 --> 53:37.562
-Yes.

53:38.171 --> 53:40.608
-Oh, thank you.

53:43.307 --> 53:45.265
-Do you live around here?

53:45.309 --> 53:46.397
-Hm?

53:46.440 --> 53:48.877
-Do you stay like in the area?

53:48.921 --> 53:50.531
-Oh.

53:50.575 --> 53:53.012
It depends on what
you define as home.

53:53.055 --> 53:55.319
Right now, I'm living
in a funeral parlor.

53:55.362 --> 53:57.756
-A funeral parlor?

53:57.799 --> 54:00.889
-That's what I call
my mother's house.

54:00.933 --> 54:02.195
She likes to keep tabs on me

54:02.239 --> 54:04.328
when she's in
between boyfriends.

54:04.371 --> 54:07.853
I told her I'm the one that's
supposed to have boyfriends.

54:07.896 --> 54:13.772
You know, she just rolls her
eyes says I can't be trusted.

54:13.815 --> 54:16.644
-That's horrible.
-I know.

54:16.688 --> 54:18.864
-Just how it is.

54:21.170 --> 54:24.826
She's always been
competitive with me.

54:24.870 --> 54:27.089
Probably why I'm still
dependent.

54:29.744 --> 54:32.225
-Is there any way that you can
get your own place

54:32.269 --> 54:36.185
so you don't have to deal
with any of this?

54:36.969 --> 54:38.753
-Hm?

54:38.797 --> 54:42.279
-Well, is there a way you can
get your own place

54:42.322 --> 54:44.368
so you don't have to deal
with any of that?

54:44.411 --> 54:47.284
You know?

54:47.327 --> 54:48.850
-Maybe.

54:48.894 --> 54:50.330
-Maybe?

54:50.374 --> 54:52.158
-Maybe I'll show you later.

54:52.201 --> 54:53.768
-[Laughs]

54:53.812 --> 54:54.943
-[Laughs]

54:57.859 --> 55:01.385
Wait. How are you?
Tell me everything.

55:01.428 --> 55:03.256
-I'm fine.
-Fine?

55:03.300 --> 55:04.779
-Yeah.
-That's what people say

55:04.823 --> 55:06.128
to people when they're
going through something

55:06.172 --> 55:07.478
and they really need a friend.

55:07.521 --> 55:08.696
-Mnh-mnh.
-Tell me.

55:08.740 --> 55:10.785
-I'm -- I'm fine. I...

55:10.829 --> 55:14.267
It's just a lot of new things.
Um...

55:14.311 --> 55:20.186
You know, new job, no school,
and living back at home again.

55:20.229 --> 55:21.579
-It's scary, right?

55:21.622 --> 55:23.363
-Mm-hmm.

55:23.407 --> 55:25.496
-Like, what if they
make me go back?

55:25.539 --> 55:28.281
-Diana!

55:28.325 --> 55:29.326
How are you, gorgeous?

55:29.369 --> 55:31.937
-Isaac!
-Welcome home.

55:31.980 --> 55:34.940
-It's great to see Jimmy's
big sister back in town.

55:34.983 --> 55:37.856
-Used to be known
as my brother.

55:37.899 --> 55:39.597
Isaac, this is Benita.

55:39.640 --> 55:41.033
-Hi, Benita. Nice to meet you.

55:41.076 --> 55:42.556
-Nice to meet you.
-[Laughs]

55:42.600 --> 55:44.036
-I went ahead
and made your favorite.

55:44.079 --> 55:46.255
-Something strong
and artisanal, I hope.

55:46.299 --> 55:48.345
-But of course.

55:48.388 --> 55:50.259
I hope it's okay, Benita.

55:50.303 --> 55:51.826
Or I can bring
you something else.

55:51.870 --> 55:54.351
-No, no. No, it's --
[Coughs]

55:54.394 --> 55:56.831
It's great. It's great.
Good. Thank you.

55:56.875 --> 55:57.919
-Alright. Enjoy.
Nice to meet you.

55:57.963 --> 55:59.268
-Diana, great to see you.

55:59.312 --> 56:01.836
-Thank you for taking
care of me.

56:01.880 --> 56:04.361
Oh. Right there.

56:04.404 --> 56:06.363
-[Laughs]

56:08.843 --> 56:12.630
-To a much needed night out.

56:12.673 --> 56:14.458
-Yes. Cheers.

56:14.501 --> 56:15.807
[Clink]

56:20.725 --> 56:21.987
-Jasmine?

56:22.030 --> 56:25.512
-Mm-hmm.
-[Gasps] Hi!

56:25.556 --> 56:26.992
How are you?

56:27.035 --> 56:29.429
I'm good. How are you?

56:29.473 --> 56:32.606
-I'm good.
Are you still married?

56:32.650 --> 56:35.740
-We don't use labels.

56:35.783 --> 56:37.219
-Good to see you.

56:37.263 --> 56:39.265
-Good to see you.

56:41.485 --> 56:43.661
-So cool.

56:43.704 --> 56:45.706
-Your brother's here.

56:45.750 --> 56:46.925
-What?

56:46.968 --> 56:48.622
-Do you want to go say hi?

57:00.634 --> 57:03.289
-No. You said you'd be healthy.

57:04.333 --> 57:06.292
-It's just socially.

57:06.335 --> 57:08.642
-Be a good brother.
You remember Benita?

57:08.686 --> 57:10.339
-Hey.
-Hi.

57:12.646 --> 57:14.169
-How are you?

57:14.213 --> 57:16.389
-I'm fine.

57:16.433 --> 57:18.739
-Okay.

57:18.783 --> 57:21.699
-Another round.
-Isaac!

57:21.742 --> 57:23.222
Yes. Keep them coming.

57:23.265 --> 57:26.181
-Got it.
-Thank you. You're the best!

57:27.008 --> 57:28.445
He's the best.

57:28.488 --> 57:31.230
-What a gem.

57:31.796 --> 57:35.016
-So where --
where are you coming from?

57:35.060 --> 57:37.802
-A, uh, quite boring date.

57:37.845 --> 57:40.761
-Why?
-Just no connection.

57:40.805 --> 57:43.721
Like Sahara, nothing.

57:47.507 --> 57:49.422
So...

57:49.466 --> 57:52.381
-Does anyone eat these?

57:52.425 --> 57:54.383
-No, I think you should take
all of them

57:54.427 --> 57:55.950
and let them melt in your purse.

57:55.994 --> 57:57.691
-Oh, thank you.
Yeah, that -- that'd be nice.

57:57.735 --> 58:01.739
-♪ I sit at the table

58:01.782 --> 58:04.655
-I thought I saw -- yeah.

58:04.698 --> 58:06.439
I like these. The roses.

58:06.483 --> 58:09.573
-Yeah, my grandmother always
had rose bushes were growing up,

58:09.616 --> 58:13.968
so I figured, great idea
to just cover my body in them,

58:14.012 --> 58:16.449
because that makes
a lot of sense.

58:16.493 --> 58:18.103
-Want to go?

58:18.146 --> 58:20.671
Oh, wait, I'm going to use
the powder room.

58:20.714 --> 58:22.455
I'll be right back.
-Oh, I'll come with you.

58:22.499 --> 58:25.589
-It's okay. I'm a big girl.
I can handle it on my own.

58:25.632 --> 58:29.506
I'm fine.
I'm taking care of myself.

58:31.769 --> 58:33.597
-You guys are funny.

58:33.640 --> 58:35.381
-Is that what we are?
-Mm-hmm.

58:35.424 --> 58:39.298
I don't have siblings,
but you guys seem close.

58:39.341 --> 58:42.910
-We've been through a lot.
You can say that.

58:42.954 --> 58:44.869
-Tough life.

58:44.912 --> 58:46.131
-[Chuckles]

58:46.174 --> 58:47.524

58:52.180 --> 58:53.878
-Okay.

58:56.837 --> 58:59.361
This is it!

58:59.405 --> 59:00.928
-Wow.
-My heaven.

59:00.972 --> 59:03.278
-[Laughs]

59:04.236 --> 59:06.325
-I rented it.

59:08.849 --> 59:10.459
What do you think?
Isn't it perfect?

59:10.503 --> 59:13.375
-So pretty.

59:13.419 --> 59:15.029
Oh!

59:15.073 --> 59:18.032
Are you kidding me?

59:18.076 --> 59:20.426
When are you officially
going to move in?

59:20.469 --> 59:23.037
-Oh, yeah, I'm not going
to move in, move in.

59:23.081 --> 59:24.343
I'm not my mom.

59:24.386 --> 59:26.084
Believe I'm still
living with her

59:26.127 --> 59:28.086
and that she still has control.

59:28.129 --> 59:30.479
Isn't it perfect?

59:30.523 --> 59:32.743
-Yeah, it is, it really is.

59:32.786 --> 59:35.136
-Benny, we can do
whatever we want here.

59:37.138 --> 59:39.619
Have you ever been to that
flea market in Paris?

59:39.663 --> 59:41.534
-Mnh-mnh.

59:41.578 --> 59:43.362
-I like going there.

59:43.405 --> 59:44.972
And I get all
these little things,

59:45.016 --> 59:47.366
and I put them on chains.

59:47.409 --> 59:50.848
I used to go with my lover
from Spain.

59:50.891 --> 59:51.979
[Chuckles]

59:52.023 --> 59:55.504
-Do you ever sell them?

59:55.548 --> 59:57.594
-He wanted to.

59:58.507 --> 01:00:00.205
Mm.

01:00:03.556 --> 01:00:04.818
[Sighs]

01:00:04.862 --> 01:00:08.082
Then we broke up, so nope.

01:00:08.126 --> 01:00:10.476
-That sucks.
-Yeah.

01:00:12.304 --> 01:00:15.002
He said it was my fault.
He twisted it.

01:00:15.046 --> 01:00:16.569
It wasn't my fault.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:18.397
-Sounds like an asshole.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:20.355
-Mm.

01:00:23.097 --> 01:00:25.056
-Men are limited.
-Mm-hmm.

01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:27.841
-But most aren't assholes.

01:00:27.885 --> 01:00:30.452
-Your brother seems nice.

01:00:30.496 --> 01:00:32.280

01:00:32.324 --> 01:00:34.892

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:38.069
He's a sweetheart.

01:00:38.112 --> 01:00:40.419
My best friend.

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:44.075
You have brothers or sisters?

01:00:44.118 --> 01:00:47.774
-No, no, no.
It's just me and my mom.

01:00:49.471 --> 01:00:51.169
-Dad?

01:00:58.176 --> 01:00:59.917
I share.

Benita.

01:01:12.407 --> 01:01:16.020
I think it's a full moon!

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.024
Wow!

01:01:20.067 --> 01:01:22.548
-Feels like a full moon.

01:01:22.591 --> 01:01:24.593
-Oh, my...

01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:29.207
-Diana?

01:01:31.078 --> 01:01:32.166
Stop!

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:33.298
-I'm getting it.

01:01:33.341 --> 01:01:35.169
-I'm serious. Don't scare me.

on the other side.

It's just a full moon.

01:02:12.206 --> 01:02:14.948
-Wow. Ah.

01:02:16.515 --> 01:02:19.692
-It's definitely a full moon.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:22.695
-Of course, if you're collecting
from an investment standpoint,

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:26.394
this vase is undoubtedly
a wise choice.

01:02:26.438 --> 01:02:27.918
You strike me
as true collectors.

01:02:27.961 --> 01:02:30.181
It has been said that collecting

01:02:30.224 --> 01:02:32.879
gives our lives
hope and purpose.

01:02:32.923 --> 01:02:35.099
-I need to think about it.

01:02:35.142 --> 01:02:37.710
-We'll be in touch.

01:02:49.853 --> 01:02:52.986
-Please do not text at work.

01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:55.119
I like to think of this
is the last place

the machines will conquer.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:59.123
-Of course. Sorry. Sorry.

01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:05.129
So why aren't we selling this?

01:03:05.172 --> 01:03:08.523
-Oh, they're damaged.

01:03:09.046 --> 01:03:11.396
-Then why are we keeping them?

01:03:11.439 --> 01:03:13.572
-Oh, I was hoping
to have them restored,

01:03:13.615 --> 01:03:15.313
but a lot of the great
restoration artists

01:03:15.356 --> 01:03:17.706
have gone out of business.

01:03:18.142 --> 01:03:20.057
-I'm going to be late.

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.798
Yeah.

01:03:21.841 --> 01:03:25.497
Mami, I'm with a friend.

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.455
No, it's not Angie.

01:03:30.458 --> 01:03:32.939
You don't know her.

01:03:32.983 --> 01:03:37.030
Com on, yo, I have to go.

01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:39.163
I have to go. I have to go.

01:03:41.905 --> 01:03:43.297
Bye. Bye, Mami.

01:03:43.341 --> 01:03:45.517
Bye-bye. Bye. Yeah.

01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:03.535
-Who were you talking to?

01:04:03.578 --> 01:04:05.363
-Oh, my mom.

01:04:08.627 --> 01:04:11.195
-I can't wait to meet her.

What does your mom think
about rehab?

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.393
She doesn't know?

01:04:35.436 --> 01:04:37.395
-Mnh-mnh.

01:04:38.352 --> 01:04:41.312

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:44.780
becomes an intrinsic part
of the life of an object.

01:19:44.823 --> 01:19:46.782
And...

01:19:48.522 --> 01:19:51.482
In fact, an object becomes
more beautiful

01:19:51.525 --> 01:19:54.050
because it's been broken.

01:19:57.575 --> 01:19:59.184
That's the heart of it,
isn't it?

01:19:59.228 --> 01:20:01.361
-Yeah. It's beautiful.

01:20:01.405 --> 01:20:03.755
-Yeah.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:09.456
I just came to that, um,
today's -- I'm leaving early

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.110
today, so, um...

01:20:11.154 --> 01:20:13.199
-Okay.
-Have a have a good evening.

01:20:13.243 --> 01:20:15.505
-Night, Peter.

01:20:22.382 --> 01:20:25.821
Benita, can you
hand me that volume?

01:20:30.434 --> 01:20:32.653
-Have you tried Google?

01:20:32.697 --> 01:20:34.612
-[Chuckles] Uh...

01:20:34.655 --> 01:20:37.528
I do not trust
the information online.

01:20:45.971 --> 01:20:48.452
-Is this your family?

01:20:48.495 --> 01:20:50.628
-Yes.

01:20:50.671 --> 01:20:52.760
They live in North Carolina.

01:20:52.804 --> 01:20:56.895
My mom is a schoolteacher,
and her family is there,

01:20:56.939 --> 01:20:59.505
so she's there.

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:02.509

01:21:02.553 --> 01:21:06.687
-You know, it's fine.
I travel a lot.

and to find.

01:21:23.182 --> 01:21:25.097
-Not to you.

reading my books.

-I'm sorry.

-Benny, I-I'm sorry.

01:22:10.273 --> 01:22:14.016

the dedication ceremony.

01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:17.280

01:22:17.323 --> 01:22:18.716

01:22:18.759 --> 01:22:20.936

They set me up.

01:22:46.744 --> 01:22:50.617

and then they just take it away.

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:55.883
I mean, I keep trying.

01:22:55.927 --> 01:22:58.625
You know, I try so hard,

01:22:58.669 --> 01:23:01.280
and I keep ending up
right back at the same place.

01:23:01.324 --> 01:23:03.761
And I'm like, "No, I'm going
to try harder.

01:23:03.804 --> 01:23:05.937
I can try harder,
I can do better,

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:07.199

-It's actually
the anniversary

of my partner's passing.

01:25:20.245 --> 01:25:22.508
-I'm so sorry.

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:25.032
-It was 19 years ago.

01:25:30.821 --> 01:25:33.476
It still feels like
it happened an hour ago.

01:25:36.609 --> 01:25:38.523

He hated all the rules.
of the company.

01:26:09.425 --> 01:26:13.210
He always was fighting
with the company director.

01:26:13.255 --> 01:26:17.563
He had no patience
for anything less than ideal.

01:26:19.304 --> 01:26:22.177
We always used to say
things like,

01:26:22.219 --> 01:26:25.180
"Until then..."

01:26:25.223 --> 01:26:30.707
And then suddenly
my life became "since then."

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:36.147
Anyway, this was our spot.

01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:38.323
We always used to come here
after performances

01:26:38.367 --> 01:26:44.547
and gossip about the socialites
and laugh.

01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:49.246

laugh so much.

on the street.

And I know it's him, putting
that person in front of me

I should move on.

to be broken.

-I'm so proud of you.
You know that, don't you?

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:58.784
-Could I take these out
of the store for a little bit?

01:29:58.827 --> 01:30:01.352
I have an idea.
It might not work.

I was talking about.

-I don't know.

01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:30.120
The Dutch still lifes
are so boring.

01:30:30.163 --> 01:30:32.818
-Good afternoon.
Welcome.

01:30:32.862 --> 01:30:36.518
-This is a brilliant painting.
-Yes. Yes.

01:30:36.561 --> 01:30:38.650
-Yeah, but it doesn't really
speak to me.

01:30:38.693 --> 01:30:41.523
-This still life dates
to the 17th-century Delft.

01:30:41.566 --> 01:30:45.527
The pomegranates symbolize
abundance and fertility.

01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:48.617
-They're not pomegranates.
They're medlars.

01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:52.664
It was an ancient fruit grown by
the Romans ate after bletting.

01:30:52.708 --> 01:30:54.187
-I'm sorry.
Did you say "bletting"?

01:30:54.231 --> 01:30:56.276
-Yes. It means "to rot."

01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:57.974
They symbolize
decaying morals --

01:30:58.017 --> 01:31:00.716

Christ's sacrifice is forsaken.

01:31:05.851 --> 01:31:08.550
Whereas the lobster
and the oyster -- the symbol

01:31:08.593 --> 01:31:10.290
for gluttony and temptation.

01:31:10.334 --> 01:31:13.816
And they have been devoured.

We'll -- We'll be in touch.

01:31:25.305 --> 01:31:28.047
Why did you say
they were pomegranates?

01:31:28.091 --> 01:31:30.441
-Because no one wants
a painting symbolizing

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:34.967
decaying morals and prostitution
in their dining room.

01:31:35.011 --> 01:31:36.360
So why not call them
pomegranates?

01:31:36.403 --> 01:31:39.276
