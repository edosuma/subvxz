You want to stay

All I'm asking for is Franklin.

I can't do this

track you fucking down,

01:17.600 --> 01:19.780
Whatever he promised you,
it is not worth it.

So, what you want to do?

some old man is bad?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.760
Working with the Soviets,

you understand they will tear

Whether or not

04:25.380 --> 04:27.180
And then I'll come back.

04:49.950 --> 04:52.350
You think that's where

04:57.080 --> 04:59.870
Tracked your father down,

05:02.450 --> 05:05.490
Burnt the place to the ground.

05:05.690 --> 05:07.630
Went to the KGB for help.

Got you chained

to release me now.

13:54.010 --> 13:56.310
you cannot pin that on me.

What fucking world
are you living in?

14:02.660 --> 14:04.170
[exhales deeply]

14:04.370 --> 14:06.380
What have you been doing

14:06.580 --> 14:08.310
besides laundering
your son's money

14:08.510 --> 14:11.500
and helping him build an empire?

14:20.610 --> 14:21.810
Yeah.

14:22.010 --> 14:23.320
Wait, wait, wait.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.720
You don't want to know
what happened to Alton?

14:27.450 --> 14:29.790
I thought I did.

14:31.660 --> 14:33.270
But however Alton died,

14:33.470 --> 14:35.410
there's nothing that can be done
about it now.

14:35.610 --> 14:38.030
I can only find comfort
in knowing

14:38.230 --> 14:40.860
that you will die here.

14:41.060 --> 14:45.240
And you will never touch another
member of my family again.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.190
Alton's not dead.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.940
Fuck you.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.180
Did you see a body?

14:52.380 --> 14:54.770
Or blood?

14:54.970 --> 14:57.010
Or signs of a struggle?

14:57.210 --> 15:00.190
I watched you leave
your building that day.

15:00.390 --> 15:01.850
I went up the stairs,
I found him alone,

15:02.050 --> 15:04.120
I drugged him, I took him
down to a waiting car,

15:04.320 --> 15:05.920
I drove him to an airport,

15:06.120 --> 15:10.230
and I flew him to Puerto Rico
where I put him in a jail cell.

15:10.430 --> 15:12.320
You're lying.

15:13.660 --> 15:16.390
But I promise you Alton's alive.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.050
Want to see him?

15:29.750 --> 15:32.860
â™ª

15:37.690 --> 15:39.550
Put the hood back on.

16:05.300 --> 16:07.200
[sighs]

16:11.000 --> 16:12.430
Promise me again,
Teddy won't be alive

16:12.630 --> 16:14.470
to come after my family.

16:14.670 --> 16:15.760
FRANKLIN:
I got you.

16:17.380 --> 16:19.940
Hope you get to see 'em again.

16:21.150 --> 16:23.170
Yeah, me, too, amigo.

16:23.370 --> 16:25.860
[coyote howls in distance]

16:26.060 --> 16:27.150
Thank you, <i>moreno.</i>

16:30.150 --> 16:32.450
What you gonna do now?

16:32.650 --> 16:34.940
I have no idea
what's next for me.

16:35.140 --> 16:36.390
Back in the ring maybe?

16:36.590 --> 16:39.010
[laughs]

16:39.210 --> 16:41.150
No, El Oso is retired.

16:41.350 --> 16:43.460
How about a new character?

16:43.660 --> 16:45.360
The Saint!

16:45.560 --> 16:47.310
â™ª

16:55.840 --> 16:57.630
Oso.

17:09.020 --> 17:10.820
What made you get a place
all the way out here?

17:12.470 --> 17:13.840
We was looking for properties.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.910
A place to park some cash.

17:16.110 --> 17:18.270
Heard a woman at the stables
talking about it.

17:22.030 --> 17:23.260
I got to piss.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.830
Just, uh...

17:30.180 --> 17:32.010
Be right back.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.060
[clattering]

18:04.770 --> 18:07.180
[shuddering]

18:14.260 --> 18:15.970
Louie, what are you doing?

18:16.170 --> 18:18.150
Let me see your pager.

18:18.350 --> 18:19.420
What?

18:19.620 --> 18:21.390
Your pager!
Give it to me.

18:21.590 --> 18:23.010
Fuck out of here.
Give me my gun back...

18:23.210 --> 18:25.150
- [gun cocks]
- Jesus.

18:25.350 --> 18:28.090
[Buckley panting]

18:28.290 --> 18:30.050
Don't know what the fuck
you think you gonna find,

18:30.250 --> 18:32.640
but knock yourself out.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.920
Get on the ground,
put your hands on your head.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.900
Do it now!

18:56.580 --> 18:59.050
Motherfucker...

18:59.250 --> 19:00.980
I knew it.

19:01.180 --> 19:03.120
He did page you...

19:03.320 --> 19:05.160
from Skully's
the day I was grabbed.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.510
What happened?!

19:07.700 --> 19:09.130
What, you was too high
to respond?

19:09.330 --> 19:10.540
That's not true.

19:10.740 --> 19:12.510
- Give me the keys.
- He didn't fucking call me!

19:12.710 --> 19:13.510
- [gunshot]
- Ah!

19:13.710 --> 19:14.970
Fuck! Louie.

19:16.250 --> 19:17.520
You're crazy, you know that?

19:17.710 --> 19:19.100
I ain't giving you my keys.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.380
I don't want to have kill you,

19:21.580 --> 19:23.450
have your kids find out
their daddy's murdered.

19:23.650 --> 19:25.700
But I will put this bullet
in your head

19:25.900 --> 19:28.400
if you don't give me them keys
right fucking now!

19:34.610 --> 19:37.000
There's no house in Ojai,
is there?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.540
And no money?

19:39.740 --> 19:41.500
Lie facedown on the ground.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.830
And don't fucking move
until I'm gone.

19:58.810 --> 20:00.780
[car door opens]

20:04.370 --> 20:07.130
[starts engine]

20:17.900 --> 20:20.040
[door squeaks]

20:39.200 --> 20:40.510
Morning.

20:42.650 --> 20:43.860
How you feeling?

20:45.060 --> 20:46.570
Can I please have some water?

20:46.770 --> 20:48.210
Sure.

20:51.860 --> 20:53.660
[pours water]

21:01.530 --> 21:03.380
The account numbers,

21:03.580 --> 21:05.500
and I'll give you
all the water you want.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.200
What did you give Gustavo
to turn me over?

21:18.680 --> 21:21.230
Less than I thought I'd have to.

21:21.420 --> 21:23.340
So, you were gone
a couple hours.

21:25.310 --> 21:29.210
So that's time to get
over the border.

21:33.700 --> 21:34.790
Northern Mexico.

21:34.990 --> 21:37.290
Quit fucking stalling, Teddy.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.470
Put yourself in my position.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.110
Would you really give up
the only leverage that you had?

21:47.310 --> 21:48.470
I was in your position.

21:50.470 --> 21:52.010
Remember?

21:52.210 --> 21:56.550
When you T-boned my car,
tased me, tied me up.

21:59.350 --> 22:00.370
You know, for the longest time

22:00.570 --> 22:01.800
I wondered why
you did that shit.

22:04.560 --> 22:07.030
Why you didn't just
walk up to me,

22:07.230 --> 22:09.450
introduce yourself,

22:09.650 --> 22:11.550
say you wanted to be
in business?

22:11.750 --> 22:14.260
I had to make sure you were
ready for what was coming.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.140
See if you're strong enough.

22:18.340 --> 22:20.840
No, no, no, that's not it.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.510
You were manipulating me
from the start.

22:25.270 --> 22:27.460
Taking me to that Iranian bank,

22:27.660 --> 22:29.880
acting like you wanted
to help me,

22:30.080 --> 22:31.570
when really
all you wanted to do was

22:31.770 --> 22:34.540
know where I was
keeping my money.

22:34.740 --> 22:37.160
Just like you're doing
to my mother right now--

22:37.360 --> 22:39.510
feeding her that bullshit
about Alton.

22:39.710 --> 22:42.410
- It's not bullshit.
- It don't fucking matter.

22:42.610 --> 22:44.270
I don't give a fuck about Alton!

22:44.470 --> 22:47.220
Dead, alive or whatever.

22:51.810 --> 22:53.700
[clattering]

22:53.900 --> 22:55.610
[clears throat]

22:59.790 --> 23:02.440
The account numbers.
Last time I'm gonna ask you.

23:03.690 --> 23:07.050
Oh, you know,
I didn't memorize them.

23:07.250 --> 23:10.310
Then, where the fuck
do you have 'em written down?

23:14.520 --> 23:16.460
[clatters loudly]

23:19.150 --> 23:21.860
You know...

23:22.060 --> 23:23.210
I'm trying real fucking hard

23:23.410 --> 23:24.900
to make you understand

23:25.100 --> 23:26.570
just how desperate I am.

23:35.650 --> 23:38.220
I hope...

23:38.420 --> 23:40.760
it's not too late
before you believe me.

23:46.660 --> 23:49.300
How do I know
if I told you anything

23:49.500 --> 23:50.720
you wouldn't just shoot...?

23:50.920 --> 23:52.930
- [gun clicks]
- Goddamn it.

23:53.130 --> 23:55.100
[exhales deeply]

23:55.300 --> 23:57.350
Oh.

23:57.550 --> 23:59.730
Not so much of a surprise
on that one.

23:59.930 --> 24:02.830
You only had about
a 16% chance of dying there.

24:03.030 --> 24:05.110
[panting]

24:05.310 --> 24:07.490
You kill me, you get nothing.

24:07.690 --> 24:09.600
Well, I'd have the knowledge
that you was dead

24:09.800 --> 24:10.640
and I was the motherfucker
that did it.

24:10.840 --> 24:11.980
That's something.

24:12.180 --> 24:14.120
- [gun clicks]
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.330
20% on that one, Teddy.

24:16.530 --> 24:18.920
But now shit starts
to get worse for you

24:19.120 --> 24:20.580
very fucking quickly.

24:20.780 --> 24:22.480
[exhales]
This is bullshit.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.820
[nervous chuckle]
I... You wouldn't risk

24:25.020 --> 24:27.030
losing the money.

24:27.230 --> 24:29.410
Are they blanks?

24:29.610 --> 24:31.220
[clicks, fires]

24:34.160 --> 24:35.740
You think I'm bullshitting?

24:37.780 --> 24:39.400
Oh, you've lost your mind.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.150
Yep.

24:46.350 --> 24:47.960
[gun cylinder rolls, clicks]

24:49.550 --> 24:51.280
Let's go again.

24:52.480 --> 24:53.730
Franklin.

24:55.830 --> 24:56.900
That's enough.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.930
[breathing deeply]

25:22.100 --> 25:24.880
What's wrong? Huh?

25:25.080 --> 25:26.190
What are you doing?

25:26.390 --> 25:28.540
You see his face in there?

25:28.740 --> 25:30.510
That motherfucker's
about to crack.

25:30.710 --> 25:32.890
We just got
to stay on him, Mama.

25:33.090 --> 25:34.480
He doesn't want to die in there.

25:34.680 --> 25:37.830
Franklin... I think
we need to let this go.

25:38.030 --> 25:39.360
Mm-hmm.

25:40.810 --> 25:42.520
What?

25:42.720 --> 25:45.520
Hand Teddy over to Ruben,
let the KGB handle it for us.

25:45.720 --> 25:49.870
Let's just get the tapes and
let's just leave the country.

25:50.070 --> 25:51.290
Mama, what the fuck
are you talking about?

25:51.490 --> 25:53.910
Baby, I see
what this is doing to us.

25:54.110 --> 25:56.220
What it's already done.

25:56.420 --> 25:57.670
Look at me.

25:57.870 --> 26:00.120
Revenge is the only
fucking thing on my mind,

26:00.320 --> 26:02.230
and look at you...
[sobbing softly]

26:02.430 --> 26:06.970
This, this obsession
with this money.

26:08.840 --> 26:11.030
Look at where we are, Franklin.

26:11.230 --> 26:13.450
- What we're becoming.
- What we're becoming?

26:13.650 --> 26:15.690
You think we're the first people
in this world to play dirty?

26:15.890 --> 26:17.240
- [shushing]
- Carnegie, Mellon,
fucking Rockefeller?

26:17.440 --> 26:18.760
They were all killers...

26:18.960 --> 26:20.560
I don't want to be
a fucking killer.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.150
And I don't want that for you.

26:22.350 --> 26:23.990
You're too late.

26:26.540 --> 26:28.100
I don't believe that.

26:29.890 --> 26:31.240
Look...

26:33.450 --> 26:36.570
Let's just, let's just get out

26:36.770 --> 26:38.270
while we still have
something to save.

26:38.470 --> 26:39.820
- No, Franklin...
- Oh, fuck.

26:40.020 --> 26:41.920
Let the dream die, baby.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.130
- [chuckles]
- Please.

26:43.330 --> 26:44.240
- [grunts]
- Franklin.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.700
[scoffs]

26:47.290 --> 26:49.290
What?

26:55.430 --> 26:57.350
She's right.

26:57.550 --> 26:58.940
I've been around you
my whole life,

26:59.140 --> 27:02.640
so I know how bad you want this,
and I always believed in you.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.120
But trust me when I tell you,

27:04.320 --> 27:07.540
you don't want to go
to the place you about to go.

27:07.740 --> 27:09.540
It's hell down there,
and you don't even know

27:09.740 --> 27:11.730
if you'll be able to
pull yourself back up.

27:24.740 --> 27:26.210
Okay.

27:26.410 --> 27:28.320
Uh...

27:28.520 --> 27:30.230
Let me be very clear.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.960
I'll never give up.

27:36.610 --> 27:38.500
Never.

27:38.700 --> 27:41.140
I will get back
my fucking money.

27:42.410 --> 27:43.970
Everybody breaks.

27:45.420 --> 27:46.640
Everybody.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.280
[gun cylinder rolls, clicks]

27:50.900 --> 27:52.280
[door slams]

28:04.020 --> 28:06.490
[gasping]

28:06.690 --> 28:08.870
Fuck, Franklin.

28:09.070 --> 28:10.820
Sorry, baby.

28:16.650 --> 28:18.170
You okay?

28:19.520 --> 28:20.520
No.

28:22.690 --> 28:25.370
I got a call
from the bank yesterday.

28:25.570 --> 28:27.200
We've officially bounced
our first mortgage check

28:27.400 --> 28:29.110
for Spring Street.

28:30.810 --> 28:33.220
I told them it was just
a transfer error.

28:34.740 --> 28:36.630
Had them put a stop
on all other payments,

28:36.830 --> 28:39.630
but we are tapped out, Franklin.

28:39.830 --> 28:41.770
Can afford to fall behind
by a couple months

28:41.970 --> 28:45.300
on any of the other properties,
but... not downtown.

28:46.550 --> 28:50.020
The moment we miss a payment,
the sharks will smell blood.

28:50.220 --> 28:52.300
This is what the banks live for.

28:52.500 --> 28:55.060
They will do everything they can
to take ownership away from us.

28:55.260 --> 28:57.090
We have no friends here.

28:57.290 --> 28:59.230
[sighs]

28:59.430 --> 29:01.620
We have to get this money,
we have to get it now.

29:01.820 --> 29:03.320
[sighs]

29:04.770 --> 29:06.840
I'm doing everything I can.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.170
[Teddy gasps]

29:24.890 --> 29:26.210
Hi, Teddy.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.350
I'm Veronique.

29:32.830 --> 29:34.800
My mother never cooked.

29:36.280 --> 29:38.830
- Wouldn't get within
ten feet of a stove.
- [flicking lighter]

29:39.030 --> 29:40.410
I thought it was
some feminist thing--

29:40.610 --> 29:42.760
the rejection
of societal norms.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.760
She's that kind of woman.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.700
And then one day,

29:46.900 --> 29:49.080
she told me this story,
how when she was a girl

29:49.280 --> 29:51.600
her grandmother was cooking
Christmas dinner,

29:51.800 --> 29:54.130
and a grease fire
caught in the kitchen.

29:56.860 --> 29:59.480
Have you ever seen what
hot oil does to human skin?

30:01.380 --> 30:02.640
I haven't either,

30:02.840 --> 30:04.470
but apparently
it was ugly enough

30:04.670 --> 30:07.610
to scare my mother
out the kitchen for life.

30:07.810 --> 30:09.820
[flicking lighter]

30:10.020 --> 30:13.770
I really hope you do
the right thing here.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.610
She seems nice.

30:34.520 --> 30:37.350
Do you remember
when you asked me...

30:38.690 --> 30:41.030
...if I was prepared to kill
your whole family

30:41.230 --> 30:42.760
to save this operation?

30:45.940 --> 30:47.490
If that's who I was?

30:51.910 --> 30:53.310
Is this who you are?

30:53.510 --> 30:56.420
Just admit that
you made a mistake

30:56.620 --> 30:59.560
and give me
my fucking money, Teddy.

30:59.760 --> 31:02.150
I can't, man,
I've made promises.

31:02.350 --> 31:05.080
I don't give a fuck

31:05.280 --> 31:07.440
about your promises.

31:12.930 --> 31:14.210
Last chance.

31:21.870 --> 31:23.460
[sighs]

31:35.850 --> 31:36.650
Franklin.

31:38.060 --> 31:39.080
Franklin, wait.

31:39.280 --> 31:42.260
Franklin, no, please.

31:42.460 --> 31:43.720
Just wait.

31:45.410 --> 31:46.750
Franklin, no.

31:46.950 --> 31:48.890
Wait.

31:49.090 --> 31:50.140
Please don't do this.

31:51.350 --> 31:53.390
Please don't do this.

31:54.770 --> 31:56.220
Please.

31:57.180 --> 31:59.310
You're making me do this.

31:59.510 --> 32:00.530
[groans]

32:02.500 --> 32:04.190
- [oil sizzling]
- [screaming]

32:07.920 --> 32:09.750
[screaming continues]

32:22.520 --> 32:24.350
[door opens]

32:28.800 --> 32:30.770
[door closes]

32:32.980 --> 32:34.570
HAVEMEYER:
He's not here.

32:37.570 --> 32:39.250
When was the last time
you heard from him?

32:39.450 --> 32:42.190
Are you Havemeyer?

32:48.750 --> 32:50.880
Parissa...

32:51.080 --> 32:52.610
I need you to tell me
anything you can

32:52.800 --> 32:54.720
about the last time
you spoke to Teddy.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.550
[Parissa exhales softly]

32:58.830 --> 33:00.210
It was yesterday morning.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.390
And we were...

33:06.010 --> 33:07.390
He proposed.

33:09.050 --> 33:10.210
He was worried...

33:10.410 --> 33:12.690
about Franklin

33:12.890 --> 33:14.920
and about the Russians.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.780
Is he okay?

33:21.960 --> 33:23.750
[shuddering]

33:33.350 --> 33:36.890
[weakly]:
You are... an animal.

33:37.090 --> 33:39.250
I am what you've made me.

33:47.260 --> 33:49.300
[exhales]

33:53.330 --> 33:55.160
Can I ask you something?

33:58.820 --> 34:00.480
Why'd you do this to me?

34:04.450 --> 34:06.210
After everything
I've done for you...

34:08.320 --> 34:10.180
...after always
having your back...

34:12.840 --> 34:14.490
...why wipe me out?

34:17.220 --> 34:19.290
You still think
this is about you.

34:22.290 --> 34:24.520
This is about

34:24.720 --> 34:29.510
what $70 million
in covert funds can do.

34:31.550 --> 34:34.400
I'm not talking about fucking
airplanes and penthouses.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.400
I'm talking about...
[gasping]

34:36.600 --> 34:39.990
...protecting this country

34:40.190 --> 34:42.250
from people who want
to destroy it.

34:44.940 --> 34:47.620
I'm talking about you...

34:47.820 --> 34:50.550
your family...

34:50.750 --> 34:52.220
and your neighborhood.

34:55.530 --> 34:58.210
You don't think
that cost something?

34:58.410 --> 35:00.490
You think that just happens?

35:00.690 --> 35:02.390
No.

35:02.590 --> 35:03.980
- It doesn't just happen.
- Enough.

35:04.180 --> 35:05.460
Enough. Stop. Stop.

35:05.660 --> 35:09.470
Stop with your
fucking bullshit, okay?

35:09.670 --> 35:13.470
The Pentagon spends
$250 billion a year on defense.

35:13.670 --> 35:16.020
But you needed my pocket change?

35:16.220 --> 35:18.280
The fuck you did, man!

35:19.700 --> 35:21.930
- Tell me the truth, Teddy.
- [groaning]

35:22.130 --> 35:23.740
It's all you've got left.

35:25.290 --> 35:28.140
Why did you take
my fucking money?

35:28.340 --> 35:30.540
'Cause it's not
your fucking money!

35:36.370 --> 35:37.600
What?

35:37.800 --> 35:41.670
It's my cocaine
and it's my operation.

35:41.870 --> 35:45.160
I made you what you are.

35:45.360 --> 35:48.130
Everything you have

35:48.330 --> 35:52.440
is because I allowed you
to have it.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.650
And if I look around one day

35:54.850 --> 35:57.310
and I decided that those funds
could be better spent

35:57.510 --> 35:59.620
trying to preserve
our way of life,

35:59.820 --> 36:02.800
then you are goddamn right
that's what's gonna happen.

36:02.990 --> 36:05.450
[pained groaning]

36:05.650 --> 36:08.530
Well, now we're getting
somewhere.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.630
[labored breathing]

36:10.830 --> 36:12.460
So, did you even think
for a second

36:12.660 --> 36:14.170
what that would do to me?

36:16.790 --> 36:19.170
What I'd have to do
to try and get that back?

36:21.760 --> 36:23.640
No?

36:23.840 --> 36:25.350
Or yes...

36:26.800 --> 36:29.340
...but you just
didn't give a shit?

36:29.540 --> 36:33.290
I thought I would live
with the consequences.

36:38.120 --> 36:40.190
Well, here they are.

36:46.300 --> 36:47.850
- [hyperventilating]
- [flicks lighter]

36:54.830 --> 36:56.690
FRANKLIN:
You never fucking respected me.

37:01.380 --> 37:03.240
[sniffles]
Never saw me as a partner.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.580
But you know
that's how I saw you?

37:06.780 --> 37:09.450
I actually thought
you was my friend.

37:09.650 --> 37:12.220
And as fucked-up
as that sounds... [chuckles]

37:13.740 --> 37:16.520
I mean, shit,
seeing as we're telling truths,

37:16.720 --> 37:19.630
I actually thought that
we might know each other

37:19.830 --> 37:21.890
for the rest of our lives.

37:23.860 --> 37:25.100
Barbecues and shit.

37:30.900 --> 37:33.400
And you know earlier

37:33.600 --> 37:34.990
when you said I think
this is all about me?

37:35.190 --> 37:36.480
I don't.

37:36.670 --> 37:40.010
No, no. It really is
just about the money.

37:41.670 --> 37:44.210
Everything I had to do...

37:44.410 --> 37:46.910
what I had to become to get it.

37:48.670 --> 37:52.110
So don't give me any more
bullshit about God

37:52.310 --> 37:54.460
and country
and larger sacrifices.

37:54.660 --> 37:56.010
No.

37:56.210 --> 37:59.260
The fact that you cleaned me out
and took it all from me

37:59.460 --> 38:02.200
means this shit
is all about you.

38:11.110 --> 38:13.820
Why didn't you leave me some?

38:14.020 --> 38:16.450
Huh?

38:16.650 --> 38:18.980
I mean, shit, you could've
left me $5 million.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.420
And said
"Thank you for your service."

38:23.620 --> 38:26.110
I still would've come at you,
but at least,

38:26.310 --> 38:28.350
at least I'd know
that you valued what I did.

38:28.550 --> 38:30.630
But no. You took it all
away from me.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.050
You cleaned me out

38:32.250 --> 38:34.050
because you wanted me to know
who was in charge.

38:34.250 --> 38:36.480
You wanted me to feel
like nothing, right?

38:38.930 --> 38:41.540
Because...

38:41.740 --> 38:43.900
you're the hero
in your own story.

38:46.180 --> 38:48.510
And in your story,

38:48.710 --> 38:52.180
the guy that looks like you
always wins.

38:56.980 --> 38:58.780
But not this time, nigga.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.610
You're gonna die in here.

39:03.960 --> 39:07.170
Alone and unloved.

39:08.750 --> 39:11.540
No star at Langley.

39:11.740 --> 39:14.310
No father or brother
to mourn you.

39:16.450 --> 39:20.280
Not even a blip
on the radar of history.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.110
That's your story.

39:30.120 --> 39:33.430
I wanted to hurt you so bad...

39:36.190 --> 39:38.230
â™ª

39:41.340 --> 39:42.680
Why?

39:47.830 --> 39:49.480
'Cause you left me.

39:57.460 --> 39:58.250
[exhales]

40:03.840 --> 40:05.110
Hey.

40:05.310 --> 40:06.740
What if we split it?

40:09.430 --> 40:12.360
I can't give it all back.

40:12.550 --> 40:13.580
I can't.

40:15.370 --> 40:17.100
But what if we split it?

40:19.030 --> 40:21.330
$37 million.

40:21.530 --> 40:25.130
You're fucking crazy.
Split the money?

40:25.330 --> 40:27.060
You're in no position
to dictate terms.

40:27.260 --> 40:29.100
TEDDY:
I'm asking.

40:29.300 --> 40:31.590
We each walk away with
a small fortune...

40:33.460 --> 40:35.770
...and then we go
our separate ways.

40:40.880 --> 40:41.920
FRANKLIN:
Okay.

40:43.230 --> 40:45.250
But I'm not giving you up
until I have my half

40:45.450 --> 40:47.670
and I'm free and fucking clear.

40:47.870 --> 40:50.190
I'll put your half
into an escrow account.

40:50.390 --> 40:52.020
I can do it here,

40:52.210 --> 40:54.160
over the phone,
waiting to be transferred.

40:54.350 --> 40:57.950
And then we decide on a
handoff place somewhere public.

40:58.150 --> 40:59.510
And when we're both there,

40:59.710 --> 41:01.960
and we feel secure,
I'll make the final call

41:02.160 --> 41:04.030
and transfer the funds.

41:04.230 --> 41:06.320
And what about all of this, huh?

41:08.560 --> 41:10.940
You just gonna
forgive and forget?

41:13.570 --> 41:15.400
[gasping]

41:18.750 --> 41:21.160
Yeah, I think I've had my fill
of you and me.

41:22.710 --> 41:24.960
I do have things to live for.

41:28.890 --> 41:31.020
People to live for.

41:31.220 --> 41:33.350
Where are
the account numbers, Teddy?

41:37.900 --> 41:39.490
In my wallet.

41:49.290 --> 41:51.430
[liquid pouring]

42:02.170 --> 42:03.170

All right.

Stephen Havemeyer?

<i>HAVEMEYER [over phone]:</i>
<i>That depends. Who's this?</i>

42:31.140 --> 42:35.050
FRANKLIN:
I'm a friend of Teddy McDonald.

42:35.250 --> 42:37.500
He asked me to reach out to you,

42:37.700 --> 42:40.430
arrange a time and place
to deliver him to you.

42:40.630 --> 42:42.920
Afraid I'm not doing anything

42:43.120 --> 42:44.710
until I know
who I'm speaking to.

42:44.910 --> 42:46.680
<i>FRANKLIN:</i>
<i>You know exactly who I am.</i>

42:46.880 --> 42:50.790
Listen, your man asked for this.
Say no, and that's fine.

42:50.990 --> 42:52.790
Not only do you lose your chance
of getting Teddy back,

42:52.990 --> 42:55.690
but you also lose out
getting ahold of a KGB spy.

42:55.890 --> 42:57.050
Your choice.

43:06.160 --> 43:07.510
Hey, Mama.

43:10.270 --> 43:11.240
[exhales]

43:13.510 --> 43:16.400
Tell me this isn't happening.

43:16.600 --> 43:19.270
Tell me you're not
gonna let that man go.

43:19.470 --> 43:22.820
In two hours, we're gonna meet
with Teddy's handler,

43:23.020 --> 43:24.620
we'll do the trade-off,

43:24.820 --> 43:27.140
- this will all be over.
- Over?

43:27.340 --> 43:30.280
[scoffs]
You think this is how it ends?

43:30.480 --> 43:31.620
You think Teddy's
just gonna vanish,

43:31.820 --> 43:33.630
and y'all can go on
living y'all's lives?

43:33.820 --> 43:36.350
For $37 million,
I'm willing to take that chance.

43:36.550 --> 43:38.730
You are never gonna be safe.

43:38.930 --> 43:39.980
Do you hear me?

43:40.180 --> 43:44.080
That baby will never be safe.

43:44.280 --> 43:45.330
VERONIQUE:
Like he said,

43:45.530 --> 43:47.690

- Shut up.

43:53.310 --> 43:54.590
So, that's it?

43:55.800 --> 43:57.320
After all this...

43:58.320 --> 44:00.220
...you're with them.

44:03.770 --> 44:05.640
I'm sorry, Mama.

44:16.680 --> 44:18.880
I don't want Leon
or my grandchild

44:19.080 --> 44:20.810
anywhere near the handoff,
you hear me?

44:21.010 --> 44:24.640
I'll go with you to make sure
they don't kill you right off.

44:24.840 --> 44:27.110
And after that, I'm done.

44:28.450 --> 44:32.150
And you and I will never see
each other again.

47:43.350 --> 47:44.300
Just get me the fuck
out of here.

47:45.990 --> 47:48.400
Where's the other party?

47:48.600 --> 47:49.600
The other party

- So, what happened?

47:53.880 --> 47:55.710
What happened is
I don't know you,

47:55.910 --> 47:56.920
so I can't trust you.

47:57.120 --> 47:58.540
And you know why I can't?

47:58.740 --> 48:01.030
'Cause for the longest,
I trusted Teddy McDonald,

48:01.230 --> 48:02.790

48:02.990 --> 48:04.690
So this is what's gonna happen.

48:04.890 --> 48:08.280
Once Teddy makes the call
and completes the transfer,

48:08.480 --> 48:10.870
and I'm convinced you're not
trying to fuck me,

48:11.070 --> 48:13.010
I'll hand over the KGB agent,

48:13.210 --> 48:15.540
and we can all live
happily ever after.

48:16.920 --> 48:18.600
What if that doesn't
work for me?

48:18.800 --> 48:20.910
Then I'll call the FBI,
and make a deal with them.

48:21.110 --> 48:22.480
