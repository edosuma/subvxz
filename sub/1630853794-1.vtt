00:04.921 --> 00:07.006
[theme music playing]

00:18.685 --> 00:20.270
[Harley] Last season
on Harley Quinn,

00:20.353 --> 00:21.730
my bestie Ivy
was engaged to this lame-o,

00:21.813 --> 00:23.440
but I was in love
with her, too.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.692
Joker got a second acid bath.
I kicked Psycho's ass.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.777
Hard passed Darkseid.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.571
Saved Ivy from her
own wedding and we
drove off into the sunset.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.698
What do you think
we did next, hmm?

00:31.781 --> 00:33.658
[woman giggling]

00:34.576 --> 00:36.202
[women chuckling]

00:37.829 --> 00:39.038
[woman moaning in pleasure]

00:41.833 --> 00:42.751
[bed creaks]

00:42.834 --> 00:45.128
Now let's shed those leaves.

00:45.211 --> 00:48.089
[exaggerated moans] Uh, yeah,
I'm Ivy, ooh, yea...

00:48.173 --> 00:49.424
[Ivy] I don't even wear leaves.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.676
Still, ya gotta
respect the hustle.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.471
I mean, they wrote, shot,
and edited this in two weeks
since Psycho blew up our spot.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.932
Was that only two weeks ago?
It feels like so much longer.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.684
I know, right?

00:59.768 --> 01:01.561
-[hologram whooshing]
-The sign says
"no girls allowed"

01:01.644 --> 01:02.979
Superman's dead dad?

01:03.062 --> 01:05.315
Harlivy? What are you
doing here?

01:05.398 --> 01:07.150
Ooh! Is that our official
celeb couple name?

01:07.233 --> 01:09.235
Ugh, I would have
just gone with "Hivey".

01:09.319 --> 01:11.780
I hadn't said it out loud
before, it looks better
in writing.

01:11.863 --> 01:15.867
Now surrender, fugitives!
Wait, are you watching
a dirty movie?

01:15.950 --> 01:18.745
This is the
Fortress of Solitude!

01:18.828 --> 01:21.080
L-O-L a "dirty movie"?

01:21.164 --> 01:24.667
Uh, relax, we just dropped in
to chill for a bit and eat
all your chips

01:24.751 --> 01:26.211
while Gordon's
looking for us, okay?

01:26.294 --> 01:28.004
Your big, dumb son
says it's okay.

01:28.087 --> 01:29.255
Oh, did he now?

01:29.339 --> 01:31.257
Perhaps we should call him.

01:31.341 --> 01:34.344
-You really don't
have to do that.
-Yeah, don't do that.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.054
[hologram whooshing]

01:36.137 --> 01:37.555
Ladies, your honeymoon is over.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.724
Wrong again!
It's just beginning!

01:39.808 --> 01:41.434
C'mon, Hivey, let's bounce.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.394
-[key beeps]
-[explosion]

01:43.478 --> 01:45.772
-[Harley laughs maniacally]
-Come back here
and face justice!

01:45.855 --> 01:47.899
Wait, did you sign up
for HBO Max?

01:47.982 --> 01:49.943
I already used my free trial!

01:50.026 --> 01:51.986
Shit, shit, shit,
where'd we park? God!

01:52.070 --> 01:54.364
-How does Wonder Woman
keep track of this damn jet?
-[distant beeping]

01:54.447 --> 01:57.700
-[explosion]
-Oh! It's right
over there. Yay!

01:57.784 --> 01:59.619
So, what do we do now?

01:59.702 --> 02:02.372
Let the "Eat Bang Kill"
tour begin.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.499
-Come here.
-[both kissing, moaning]

02:04.582 --> 02:05.458
[jet whooshing]

02:06.417 --> 02:08.044
[muffled screams]

02:08.127 --> 02:10.171
To us, together at last.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.341
Harley and Ivy take over
the fucking world!

02:13.883 --> 02:14.717
[pops]

02:15.426 --> 02:16.469
[impact thuds]

02:19.764 --> 02:21.891
-[man] Hello? Hello?
-[Ivy chuckles]

02:21.975 --> 02:23.643
-This is Commissioner Gordon.
-[whispers] Oh, he's on!
He's on! You, you!

02:23.726 --> 02:25.728
[clears throat] This is the IRS
calling, sir,

02:25.812 --> 02:28.314
you have a $90,000 lien
on your house.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.483
How in the he--
is this about my ex-wife?

02:30.567 --> 02:33.820
We're gonna need to confirm
your identity. What's your
credit card number again?

02:33.903 --> 02:37.490
-Oh, life saver!
So, any credit card?
-Gimme, gimme, gimme!

02:37.574 --> 02:39.117
The one with the highest limit.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.578
Okay, let's see.
You ready for the number?
Four-six...

02:42.996 --> 02:45.540
-Charge it to the room.
-Missus and Missus Gordon.

02:45.623 --> 02:46.958
[glasses clinking]

02:47.041 --> 02:48.960
-[Harley laughing maniacally]
-[jet whooshes]

02:51.588 --> 02:53.214
-[Harley grunts]
-Ugh.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.258
-[grunting]
-[impact thuds]

02:55.341 --> 02:58.845
-[man screaming]
-Send our regards to whatever
shitty tabloid you work for!

02:58.928 --> 03:03.224
And tell Ben Affleck
I upper-decked his
fancy soda stream!

03:03.308 --> 03:05.018
[Harley screaming]

03:07.520 --> 03:08.730
[sighs]

03:08.813 --> 03:10.565
-Champagne, my queen?
-[Ivy chuckles]

03:10.648 --> 03:13.318
Harls, I gotta tell ya,
this trip you have
planned for us--

03:13.401 --> 03:14.819
Call her by her name.

03:14.903 --> 03:18.489
Right, the "Eat Bang
Kill Tour," is just so sweet,

03:18.573 --> 03:20.074
it's so fun,
and then raunchy...

03:20.158 --> 03:21.784
[chuckles nervously]
...and then a little scary.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.620
I know, it's going to be
hard to top

03:23.703 --> 03:25.580
punching a bunch of
Buckingham guards
in the dick though.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.498
[gasps] Oh, oh,
tell me your favorite part.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.293
Um, I really liked walking
through the Queen's
rose garden.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.962
Each rose totally blooming
to her full potential.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.672
I'm like what is
this woman's secret...

03:34.756 --> 03:36.925
[woman] It's all about
the sprinkler schedule.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.301
Who said that?

03:38.384 --> 03:40.345
-[woman grunting]
-Queen Elizabeth the second?

03:40.428 --> 03:44.140
-How did she get in here?
-She shoved me in a bag.

03:44.223 --> 03:46.225
Happy two-week anniversary!

03:46.309 --> 03:48.394
Oh, wow, wow, Harls.

03:48.478 --> 03:52.357
-What you... You don't like it?
-No, I do. I do.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.485
I like it.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.321
-It's so pleasurable
to meet you, your majesty.
-[Queen chuckles awkwardly]

03:58.404 --> 04:02.116
Aren't people going to be,
like, looking for her?
I just took my bra off.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.993
[jets whooshing]

04:05.703 --> 04:07.372
I gotcha, Ive.
We'll wrap this thing up quick!

04:07.455 --> 04:10.667
Let's commemorate
with an emergency photo shoot.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.169
-Kiss under the missile
for good luck, Ive!
-[kisses]

04:13.252 --> 04:14.879
[camera shutter clicking]

04:14.963 --> 04:16.839
Okay, okay,
I think we got the shot!
Time to lose our tail.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.675
It's been real,
your majesty! Later!

04:18.758 --> 04:20.843
-Watch the-- Harley, no!
-[Queen screams]

04:20.927 --> 04:22.262
Yeah, she's got
an invisible parachute.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.848
I am gonna choose
not to question that.

04:25.932 --> 04:31.437
The potholes, the sinkholes,
toxic puddles, super squirrels,
exploding sewers,

04:31.521 --> 04:35.525
haunted crosswalks,
we've got children
driving busses,

04:35.608 --> 04:37.819
pregnant rats on every corner,

04:37.902 --> 04:43.783
it costs $38 to mail a letter--
Personally, I loaded up on
forever stamps in high school,

04:43.866 --> 04:45.702
but not everyone's
smart like that.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.412
[disgruntled citizens
clamoring]

04:47.495 --> 04:49.414
-So is that a question or?
-[citizens jeering]

04:49.497 --> 04:52.709
If you're elected mayor,
how the hell you gonna
fix all this, Gordon?

04:52.792 --> 04:54.502
Cheryl, you're my lieutenant!

04:54.585 --> 04:57.422
I've got step-kids to feed
and you're blowing
our tax money

04:57.505 --> 05:03.136
on tanks, robocops,
and GCPD branded water bottles.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.221
Eh, we paid for it with
the library tax.

05:05.304 --> 05:07.557
Most people are only in there
to use the bathroom, anyway.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.642
-[citizens jeering]
-Why's everybody mad at me?

05:09.726 --> 05:13.730
The biggest existential threat
to Gotham is criminals
like Harley Quinn

05:13.813 --> 05:16.149
and Poison Ivy,
who continue to wreak havoc.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.901
I'll do whatever it takes
to bring them to justice.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.236
[disgruntled citizens shouting]

05:20.319 --> 05:22.280
Mayor, you have 30 seconds
to respond.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.198
Your police budget
is out of control.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.034
-You're the mayor!
You approved my budget!
-[citizens booing]

05:26.117 --> 05:28.119
-[citizen 1] Lame!
-Boo yourself!

05:28.202 --> 05:31.497
Hold on! I've dedicated my life
to trying to keep this
piece of shit city safe!

05:31.581 --> 05:33.291
-[citizen 2] You stink!
-Nuh-uh!

05:33.374 --> 05:34.792
Hashtag team Harlivy!

05:34.876 --> 05:36.544
-[citizen 3] You suck!
-[audience booing]

05:39.005 --> 05:43.593
I'll bring Harley and Ivy
to justice, and then
you'll change your tune!

05:43.676 --> 05:46.721
Everyone's gonna be
whistlin' Jimmy Gordon baby!

05:46.804 --> 05:49.557
-[citizen 4] Fuck you!
-No, fuck you!

05:49.640 --> 05:51.476
[citizens booing, jeering]

05:51.559 --> 05:53.686
I think that went pretty well.
What do you think?

05:54.604 --> 05:56.022
[jet whooshing]

05:56.814 --> 05:58.608
[Ivy grunts]

05:58.691 --> 06:00.318
Can you believe it's been
16 whole days since we've
been together? [screams]

06:00.401 --> 06:02.236
I'm sorry,
who's flying this plane?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.489
-It's on autopilot.
Oh, shit, wait, hold on.
-[emergency beeping]

06:06.532 --> 06:08.951
-Okay, now it's on autopilot.
-[Ivy clears throat]

06:09.035 --> 06:13.456
I know I've been showering you
with super thoughtful gifts
to an almost exhausting degree,

06:13.539 --> 06:18.211
but get ready 'cause this
next one's gonna
blow your skirt up.

06:18.294 --> 06:19.921
But it's also very chill.

06:20.004 --> 06:22.632
[water splashing]

06:22.715 --> 06:26.803
We've been doing all this
intense bad guy fighting,
which you do often enjoy,

06:26.886 --> 06:29.514
but there's this whole other
side to you which is like,

06:29.597 --> 06:31.682
plants! And I love that, too.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.601
[gasps] Surprise!

06:33.684 --> 06:37.772
Ugh! No! I thought I smelled
stone-age pollen.
Why did you bring me here?

06:37.855 --> 06:41.317
Uh, what?
You built this beautiful place.
It's your baby.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.695
I thought you'd get excited
and maybe we'd mess around
a little bit.

06:44.779 --> 06:48.533
Come on,
let's have sex in your baby!

06:48.616 --> 06:51.953
I-- I brought you here
because I thought
it would inspire you.

06:52.036 --> 06:55.623
Harley, it's not inspiring,
it's-- It's a total failure.

06:55.706 --> 07:00.711
I... I had this dumb idea
to terraform Earth using
prehistoric plants.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.255
[mockingly] Ah!

07:02.338 --> 07:04.173
You know and then
I called it Edin
with an "I" for Ivy.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.217
That's so cute!

07:06.300 --> 07:08.678
Okay, the name's not great.
But the-- But the idea is!

07:08.761 --> 07:12.431
I worked on it for like way
too long, and then I could only
grow this one shitty acre--

07:12.515 --> 07:17.019
Of the most beautiful jungle
anyone's ever seen! My girl!

07:17.103 --> 07:19.355
No, I failed over
and over again.

07:19.438 --> 07:23.359
I designed it, like, ten years
ago, the colors are so dated.
Oh, my God!

07:23.442 --> 07:26.028
I feel like I'm in, like,
an Urban Outfitters
sale section.

07:26.112 --> 07:29.448
Hey. Neon is back!
Some people say
it never went away.

07:29.532 --> 07:33.077
Ivy, you spent the last
two years helping me
with my stupid bullshit

07:33.161 --> 07:34.579
and making chili with your ex.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.873
Yeah. I also died
and was resurrected.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.876
Yes, exactly.
You are a badass evil villain.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.752
You should mold the world
to your vision.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.046
It's time to focus on
what you want.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.508
Since we're here,
it's at least worth
looking around, right?

07:47.592 --> 07:49.093
[serene music playing]

07:49.177 --> 07:52.054
I mean, the root system
does look pretty strong.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.682
I used to be so into that.
[breathes deeply]

07:54.765 --> 07:57.393
-Okay. Fine.
-[Harley gasps]

07:57.476 --> 07:59.979
-We can look around.
But let's make it quick.
-[Harley squeals]

08:00.062 --> 08:01.439
[clock ticking sounds]

08:05.067 --> 08:07.069
-Oh, my God! Babe!
-What? What?

08:07.153 --> 08:09.071
Did the queen find us?
Do we need to finish her off?

08:09.155 --> 08:10.573
Start an
international incident?

08:10.656 --> 08:13.576
I just negotiated
the correct pH in
the groundwater!

08:13.659 --> 08:16.454
Oh, cool, I'm loving
how inspired you are.

08:16.537 --> 08:19.665
Bee-tee-dubs, in case
other people ask me,
what's the wi-fi here?

08:19.749 --> 08:22.752
There's no wi-fi in Edin--
That's like the whole point.

08:22.835 --> 08:27.131
A paradise that reverses
all the damage humans
have done to the environment.

08:27.215 --> 08:31.594
Where ancient plants
can finally bloom
to their full potential!

08:31.677 --> 08:32.929
Totally!

08:33.012 --> 08:36.265
Reclaiming every inch
from toxic factories,

08:36.349 --> 08:38.684
fast food chains.
Bravolebrities!

08:38.768 --> 08:40.937
But not the ones that make
their own wine, right?

08:41.020 --> 08:44.690
I cannot go back to buying
based on the label.
No fucking way.

08:44.774 --> 08:49.612
Just imagine, you and me,
sitting in the sun,
living off the nectars.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.823
We don't have to run from
anybody or bash any heads in.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.159
Um, yeah, [chuckling]
yeah, that is so cool.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.371
You know, I don't need to
bash people's heads in
or have wi-fi.

08:58.454 --> 09:01.999
I can just sit here.
Maybe I'll learn to
talk to flowers or something.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.418
And this mind control device?
Who needs it!

09:04.502 --> 09:05.753
[impact thuds]

09:05.836 --> 09:08.714
[inhales]
Oh, look at this soil!

09:08.798 --> 09:11.050
The Staghorn fern
is self-propagating,

09:11.133 --> 09:13.970
so if I can get the right
acidity levels...

09:14.053 --> 09:15.805
[indistinct creaking noises]

09:15.888 --> 09:18.224
And then, who knows,
Terraforming could be possible!

09:18.307 --> 09:19.642
-[phone buzzing]
-[Harley gasps]

09:19.725 --> 09:21.602
[grunts]

09:21.686 --> 09:24.063
Ooh! An unknown number,
maybe it's a telemarketer,
I'd better answer it!

09:24.146 --> 09:25.815
Hello, outside world!

09:25.898 --> 09:27.817
Oh, hey, girl! It's King Shark.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.653
OMG K.S. Bang Bang!
What's happening in Gotham?
Tell me all the hot goss!

09:30.736 --> 09:32.196
Well, funny you should ask,

09:32.280 --> 09:35.992
we're being tortured.
So, how are things with you?

09:36.075 --> 09:37.994
Wait-- You're being tortured?
By who?

09:38.077 --> 09:41.622
Oh, I hate to be a spoilsport
but me and Clayface
are incarcerated.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.874
[chuckles] Gordon nabbed us
at the wedding.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.543
He's holding us in Arkham.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.254
But if you're too busy
to rescue us, we understand--

09:48.337 --> 09:49.714
No! We'll be right there!

09:49.797 --> 09:52.883
Ivy! I've got
some terrible news! [squealing]

09:52.967 --> 09:54.552
[jet whooshes]

09:54.635 --> 09:56.929
So, let's just in and out,
no extra drama.

09:57.013 --> 10:00.599
My seedlings are just
in a crucial stage
and I want to get back ASAP.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.893
Oh, yeah, me, too, can't miss
the crucial seedling stage.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.062
You know, as soon as we make
Gordon pay for messing
with our crew!

10:05.146 --> 10:08.065
Let's skip Arkham
and crash this jet
right into Gordon's house

10:08.149 --> 10:09.984
and slaughter
his entire family!

10:10.067 --> 10:12.361
Honey, I know you haven't
punched anyone in the dick
in two days,

10:12.445 --> 10:14.530
but we have to be
smart about this.

10:14.613 --> 10:17.366
Actually, yesterday there was
a fox that tried to take
a shit too close to me. So...

10:17.450 --> 10:19.285
Gordon could be
using him as bait.

10:19.368 --> 10:22.496
A shark as bait? Ha!
That is so fucked up.
God, you're smart!

10:22.580 --> 10:24.665
This is why we make
a great team.

10:24.749 --> 10:28.377
You with your brilliantly
thought out strategies
and plant goddess superpowers,

10:28.461 --> 10:29.962
and me with...
[breathes sharply]

10:31.255 --> 10:32.590
-You gonna fill that part in?
-What?

10:32.673 --> 10:34.216
Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry.
I was just...

10:34.300 --> 10:35.760
[impact thuds]

10:35.843 --> 10:38.596
[windshield wipers squeaking]

10:38.679 --> 10:43.559
-Your hair looks
really good today.
-I know, right? [chuckles]

10:43.642 --> 10:47.980
The shark found the phone
we planted and called Harley
just like we thought he would.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.024
[laughs]

10:50.107 --> 10:52.693
I bring down Harley and Ivy,
no one's gonna be complaining
about the potholes,

10:52.777 --> 10:56.072
the sinkholes, toxic puddles,
exploding sewers, haunted...

10:56.155 --> 10:58.741
This is torture!
Let me out of here!

10:58.824 --> 11:02.328
Chin up, buddy!
Before you know it,
Harley is going to bust us out.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.413
She better do it soon.

11:04.497 --> 11:08.084
I have an audition in six hours
for the new Thomas Wayne
biographical picture!

11:08.167 --> 11:09.919
"A Hard Wayne's Gonna Fall."

11:10.002 --> 11:13.631
[scoffs] Another movie about
a bipedal billionaire.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.549
And a trashy reboot at that.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.761
Stop it! That puckish auteur
James Gunn,

11:18.844 --> 11:23.599
is spreading his wings
into the horizons of
award season drama!

11:23.682 --> 11:26.852
If you can't make the audition,
why don't you just
submit a tape?

11:26.936 --> 11:29.563
We could just use the phone
that suspiciously showed up

11:29.647 --> 11:31.440
in my French bread
pizza at lunch.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.025
Oh, like now? [clears throat]

11:33.109 --> 11:36.404
Hello. Clayface. Arkham Asylum.
Five to seven feet tall,

11:36.487 --> 11:39.115
or whatever suits the role
of "Thug Number Three."

11:39.198 --> 11:43.953
Willing to shave. Anywhere.

11:44.036 --> 11:48.165
Is this gonna be much longer?
I gotta go pick up
a prescription for my lizard.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.502
[Gordon chuckles] Pay dirt!

11:53.462 --> 11:54.463
-[guns cocking]
-Freeze!

11:56.549 --> 11:59.385
I'm getting nervous about
Britney and Kylie's
improv skills with Gordon.

11:59.468 --> 12:03.264
They're trained professionals.
I'm sure they're gonna buy us
at least another five minutes.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.975
[Kylie] Oh, no!
Have we been bad?

12:06.058 --> 12:08.853
[Britney] Ooh, we need
someone to punish us.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.105
Not Commissioner Gordon!

12:11.188 --> 12:14.733
Ooh, we respect
and fear him so much.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.735
Something about this
doesn't seem right.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.654
Hold on, let's hear them out.

12:18.737 --> 12:22.616
What the? Adult film actresses
Kylie Kryptonite
and Britney Bionic?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.994
-[male cop] I'm a huge fan!
-Loved you in
the "Drilling Joke."

12:25.077 --> 12:28.664
-Sign my gun?
-Can I get an autograph?
It's for my husband.

12:28.747 --> 12:29.915
[alarm blaring]

12:29.999 --> 12:32.293
[prisoners yelling]

12:32.376 --> 12:37.840
Wait. This is where you drugged
and kidnapped me to help me
escape an abusive relationship.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.175
[yells] Harlivy!

12:39.258 --> 12:41.051
-Shark face! [squeals]
-[King Shark chuckles]

12:41.135 --> 12:42.386
You look radiant!

12:42.470 --> 12:45.014
Oh, thanks! We've been doing
a ton of fucking.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.640
To the jet! Quick!

12:46.724 --> 12:49.435
God, I can't believe
I just said that,
that was so lame.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.937
Should I try that again?
You know what, nevermind,
let's just go.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.273
[alarm blaring]

12:56.275 --> 12:57.860
Watch where
you're going, Karen!

12:57.943 --> 13:01.197
Excuse you, bitch!
You just bumped
into Poison Ivy.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.033
One of the premier
supervillains in this world,

13:04.116 --> 13:06.952
newly inspired for some really
cool shit she's working on.

13:07.036 --> 13:10.331
And my BFF GFF slash--
[loudly] Hottest woman alive.

13:10.414 --> 13:14.210
Supervillain? [scoffs] Ha!
She hasn't done anything
evil in years!

13:14.293 --> 13:17.296
Where the fuck
do you get off? You--

13:17.379 --> 13:19.215
-[growls]
-Come on, Harley, let's go.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.842
[alarm continues blaring]

13:21.926 --> 13:23.719
[ominous music playing]

13:24.428 --> 13:25.846
[jet whooshes]

13:25.930 --> 13:27.932
-Yeah.
-You're not coming with?

13:28.015 --> 13:30.851
We're gonna jet back to
Edin and continue the important
work we were doing

13:30.935 --> 13:33.062
with the leaves
and measuring them...

13:33.145 --> 13:34.730
Probably having lunch
at some point...

13:34.813 --> 13:37.525
Then maybe,
maybe more leaf inspections...

13:37.608 --> 13:39.401
And you're enjoying that?

13:39.485 --> 13:43.280
Oh, yeah! I love chaos
but I also love plants.
Just like my lady.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.699
Harley, I mean, if you
want to hang with them,
you don't have to come...

13:45.783 --> 13:48.410
Are you kidding?
There's nothing I'd rather do
than listen to bae

13:48.494 --> 13:50.579
talk about chlorophyll
for a couple of weeks.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.373
So I won't be needing these...

13:52.456 --> 13:55.793
The nuclear codes expire
on Tuesday. Miss ya, mean it!

13:55.876 --> 13:58.254
Stop by whenever and also
call me if anything
cool happens

13:58.337 --> 14:01.590
and even anything uncool
happens I don't want
to miss out. Bye!

14:01.674 --> 14:03.425
-[Clayface] Huh?
-Mmm-mmm.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.428
You're what the French
call "Les Incompetents."

14:06.512 --> 14:08.597
-That's a little--
-Losing Harley and Ivy again,

14:08.681 --> 14:12.768
and now half the GCPD
is suspended for the shit
they posted on social media

14:12.851 --> 14:15.437
with pornstars.
I should have your badge!

14:15.521 --> 14:17.523
We'll let the people decide
who's gonna take whose job

14:17.606 --> 14:19.191
when I kick your butt
in the election.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.610
[laughs] You don't stand
a chance.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.779
Just ask my campaign manager.

14:23.862 --> 14:26.532
-[Mayor laughs maliciously]
-What? How could you
do this to me?

14:26.615 --> 14:28.784
-Do you know what my name is?
-[gasps]

14:28.867 --> 14:33.247
-Harvey Dent.
-Right, but my moniker?

14:33.330 --> 14:37.668
Oh! [chuckles]
[normal] I still don't get it.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.299
Ooh! Big whoops. Whatevs.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.884
Enjoy your seventh term,
Mr. Mayor!

14:45.968 --> 14:50.055
Just know this open sewer
of a city and its shit problems
are all yours

14:50.139 --> 14:52.224
and I hope you
choke on 'em. [grunts]

14:54.768 --> 14:56.353
[squirrel squeals]

14:56.437 --> 14:59.231
-[screaming] Stupid squirrel!
-[squirrel screeching]

15:00.482 --> 15:01.358
-[impact thuds]
-[grunts]

15:01.442 --> 15:02.443
[squirrel chatters away]

15:02.526 --> 15:03.736
[bubbling noises]

15:07.406 --> 15:09.283
-[tires screeching]
-[car honks]

15:09.366 --> 15:10.326
[laughing maniacally]

15:10.409 --> 15:12.036
[gasps]

15:12.119 --> 15:14.079
Ah, damn kid bus drivers!

15:14.163 --> 15:16.290
-[bus crashing]
-[explosion]

15:17.291 --> 15:18.375
[Mayor yells]

15:21.086 --> 15:24.423
Live by the polls,
die by the polls. Poetic.

15:24.506 --> 15:27.426
Good news is
I just became available again.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.974
[crying]

15:34.058 --> 15:35.851
[sobbing]

15:35.934 --> 15:37.394
[whimpering]

15:37.478 --> 15:39.438
[screams] No!

15:40.606 --> 15:42.358
[Ivy sighs]

15:42.441 --> 15:45.194
I just put the tea kettle on,
do you want chamomile
or jasmine?

15:45.277 --> 15:46.528
-[muffled grunts]
-What?

15:46.612 --> 15:48.697
-Nothing.
-[muffled grunts continue]

15:48.781 --> 15:52.242
-What is that noise?
-Well, I mean, it is our 18th
day anniversary. [chuckles]

15:52.326 --> 15:54.703
I'll give it to you later.
Actually no,
I'll give it to you now.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.955
[grunts]

15:57.039 --> 15:59.875
-So what is it with you
and, like, bags of people?
-[chuckles]

15:59.958 --> 16:01.168
Surprise!

16:01.251 --> 16:03.712
Oh, my gosh. Harley!
Do you know who this is?

16:03.796 --> 16:06.215
Yeah, it's the munch
who said you weren't evil!

16:06.298 --> 16:07.800
Let's feed her to a plant
or something!

16:07.883 --> 16:09.718
Give her an unflattering
haircut for her face shape!

16:09.802 --> 16:11.720
Show her you are
the baddest bitch
on the planet!

16:11.804 --> 16:14.556
She's head
of the Suicide Squad.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.975
Oh, so you're Amanda Waller?

16:17.059 --> 16:20.020
Oh, whoa, we need to make
a Gotham yearbook or something.

16:20.104 --> 16:23.399
I know the names but not
the faces, but sometimes
the faces and not the names.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.650
-Harls.
-[grunts]

16:24.733 --> 16:26.819
You never returned my emails.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.321
Yeah, thanks for the t-shirts
and all, but the only squad
I'm joining is Cobb.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.115
Yet you still refuse
to get the tattoo.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.033
What's your damage, Waller?

16:33.117 --> 16:35.744
Always perving on supervillains
and putting bombs
in their heads.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.790
You think you're hot shit
but no one's above being
rude to my bae! Now apologize.

16:39.873 --> 16:42.084
You think you can kidnap me
without repercussions?

16:42.167 --> 16:44.211
I eat repercussions
for breakfast!

16:44.294 --> 16:46.422
Harley, why are you stirring up
drama right now?

16:46.505 --> 16:49.425
We are supposed to be checking
mitochondrial reactions.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.260
-This is not drama, okay?
-[sighs wearily]

16:51.343 --> 16:53.387
What's she gonna do?
She's wearing a pencil skirt.

16:53.470 --> 16:57.558
You dance with me, you dance
with the entirety of a team
of renegades

16:57.641 --> 17:01.603
who take on the dirty jobs
the U.S. Government
won't even do.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.063
[rock music playing]

17:03.147 --> 17:04.440
Captain Boomerang.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.233
Killer Croc.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.152
Enchantress.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.404
Deadshot.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.780
Katana.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.533
Together they are,
The Suicide Squad.

17:14.616 --> 17:18.620
Some of the meanest psychos
who are alerted whenever
Amanda Waller

17:18.704 --> 17:19.997
sends out the signal.

17:20.080 --> 17:23.000
[woman] Which you did
about two hours ago.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.586
That's pretty cool, eh?
P.R. put it together.

17:25.669 --> 17:28.213
Oh, they want your notes
by end of day. No rush.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.090
Uh, hey! Can I see it?

17:30.174 --> 17:32.259
Oh, sure, yeah,
I'll send you the link.
Right after I kill ya.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.511
You kill us? You didn't even
make the montage!

17:34.595 --> 17:36.054
Where's everybody else?

17:36.138 --> 17:38.807
Oh, uh, P.R. has the A-team
overthrowing a dictator

17:38.891 --> 17:41.185
in Central America. But...

17:41.268 --> 17:45.856
I am Plastique.
And I'm "the bomb." [echoes]

17:48.859 --> 17:50.235
[both laughing]

17:51.069 --> 17:51.945
[Harley gasps]

17:53.155 --> 17:55.115
Oh, fuck me.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.658
Oh, I've got butterflies
of excitement!

17:56.742 --> 17:58.660
Oh, no, I'm going to faint.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.412
Pull yourself together, man!

18:00.496 --> 18:03.499
Do you want to get cast
as Thug Number Three or not?

18:03.582 --> 18:07.377
Yes! Playing a minor character
in a billion-dollar franchise

18:07.461 --> 18:09.004
is every actor's dream!

18:09.087 --> 18:11.632
-There we go.
Warm up that instrument.
-[lip trills]

18:11.715 --> 18:13.926
[both making indistinct noises]

18:14.009 --> 18:18.555
Keep going. Oh, you definitely
couldn't have done this
alone in the car.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.474
[director clears throat]

18:20.557 --> 18:23.727
"Quit ya yappin'
or the tooth fairy is gonna
need to do a little, uh...

18:23.811 --> 18:26.021
She's gonna come
and collect her--

18:26.105 --> 18:27.606
Uh, tooth, uh, fee."

18:27.689 --> 18:29.358
[chuckles] I'm sorry,
can I try it a different way?

18:29.441 --> 18:31.860
That was great! No notes!
Thanks so much!

18:31.944 --> 18:33.862
Please, I have
incredible range!

18:33.946 --> 18:35.364
I'm perfect for this role,

18:35.447 --> 18:37.616
but if not,
I can be anyone else.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.368
A shocked bystander?

18:39.451 --> 18:40.994
A lost tourist?

18:41.078 --> 18:42.871
An uncredited limo driver?

18:42.955 --> 18:47.459
I need this job.
I'll lose my SAG insurance
and the screeners!

18:47.543 --> 18:51.088
I use the elaborate boxes
they send them to store
my leftovers.

18:51.171 --> 18:53.257
How will I keep
my egg salad fresh?

18:53.340 --> 18:55.175
That sounds like a you problem.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.468
Thanks for coming out.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.137
[sighing sadly]
You already said that...

18:59.221 --> 19:01.265
Ugh, God.
This chair is killing me.

19:01.348 --> 19:04.184
Can you get me one that doesn't
make my ass fall asleep?

19:04.268 --> 19:07.020
One with lumbar
support perhaps?

19:07.104 --> 19:10.274
Please, James Gunn, sit on me!

19:15.612 --> 19:17.406
Oh. Ooh!

19:17.489 --> 19:18.782
[laughs]

19:18.866 --> 19:21.577
Well, Mister Face,
what would you say to a job

19:21.660 --> 19:24.371
on set as the director's chair?

19:24.454 --> 19:28.417
God, you look like a pile
of shit but you feel like
a pile of clouds!

19:28.500 --> 19:29.501
[Clayface gasps in delight]

19:31.003 --> 19:32.170
-[explosion]
-[Harley grunts]

19:32.254 --> 19:33.463
Bombs away!

19:34.339 --> 19:35.424
[explosion]

19:35.507 --> 19:37.384
[Plastique laughs]
Too slow, eh?

19:37.467 --> 19:39.428
-[Ivy groans]
-[gasps] Ivy!

19:39.511 --> 19:41.013
-[impact thuds]
-[Harley grunts]

19:41.096 --> 19:42.514
We really shouldn't have given
away all our weapons.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.600
We could use those
nuclear codes about now!

19:44.683 --> 19:48.770
-Here!
-Aww, but I gave that to you
for our three-day anniversary!

19:48.854 --> 19:50.063
[explosion]

19:50.147 --> 19:52.065
Well, eat scepter,
Plastique! [grunts]

19:52.149 --> 19:55.694
Ouch! God damn it.
Now we get serious!

19:55.777 --> 19:57.237
[explosion]

19:57.321 --> 19:59.031
-Oh, I think I've
heard of Plastique.
-[explosion]

19:59.114 --> 20:00.449
She's like a failed Canadian
political terrorist, right?

20:00.532 --> 20:02.409
I didn't know Canada
made terrorists.

20:02.492 --> 20:06.955
Chirp away, hosers!
I almost blew up
a super-soldier lab!

20:07.039 --> 20:10.792
Oh, is that before or after you
stole Carmen Sandiego's coat.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.962
God, you know
I meant that as an insult,
but I do love her.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.714
-Eat ash!
-[Ivy grunts]

20:15.797 --> 20:18.258
-[explosion]
-[yells] My ranunculus!

20:19.551 --> 20:20.844
[grunts]

20:20.928 --> 20:22.387
[groans]

20:22.471 --> 20:26.308
I hope you're ready to be
in a new montage. In Memoriam!

20:26.391 --> 20:29.645
[chuckles] I was born for it!

20:29.728 --> 20:31.813
[device beeps]

20:31.897 --> 20:35.067
Oh, hang on, it's gotta, yeah,
it does this little blinkie
thing before it explo--

20:35.150 --> 20:36.610
[both scream]

20:37.653 --> 20:38.987
[both grunting]

20:39.071 --> 20:40.614
[helicopter whirring]

20:44.242 --> 20:45.911
[sighs wearily]

20:45.994 --> 20:47.245
It's gone.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.539
It's all gone.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.416
I'm so sorry.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.920
Wait! Look, look!
It's not all dead.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.004
Ew!

20:57.130 --> 20:58.924
[whimpers]

20:59.007 --> 21:01.843
If I hadn't kidnapped
Amanda Waller none of this
would've happened.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.720
[crying] I'm addicted to drama!

21:03.804 --> 21:06.014
It's fine, it's fine, Harley.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.683
Edin was doomed to fail.

21:07.766 --> 21:11.645
No! I saw how happy you were,
tinkering with your shiny trees

21:11.728 --> 21:13.730
and the wet hunks of grass.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.565
And all the green stuff.

21:15.649 --> 21:18.694
Oh. Wow, please never
describe nature again.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.363
[sighs] Look, there's nothing
I want more than

21:21.446 --> 21:22.823
to terraform the world.

21:22.906 --> 21:25.867
To take it back
from humans, but... [inhales]

21:25.951 --> 21:28.745
It just can't be done.
At least not by me.

21:28.829 --> 21:32.833
That is bullshit. You can do it
because now... You have me.

21:32.916 --> 21:35.085
Harley, I saw
how bored you were.

21:35.168 --> 21:38.213
It's okay if we don't
do everything together.

21:38.296 --> 21:40.674
Disagree! These last
19-and-a-half days

21:40.757 --> 21:43.051
have been the most
emotionally dope of my life.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.303
I know the Eat Bang Kill Tour
can't go on forever.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.638
So let's get serious.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.641
I am all in!
I want what you want.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.310
Please let me help you
see your beautiful evil
plot through.

21:52.394 --> 21:56.523
Please, let's plant
some shit, please?

21:56.606 --> 21:58.317
You really think
I can do this, peanut?

21:58.400 --> 22:03.113
Yes! Totally! Partners in crime
in every sense of the word.

22:03.196 --> 22:05.866
-BFFs GFFs, right?
-[chuckles softly]

22:05.949 --> 22:07.242
[inhales deeply]

22:07.325 --> 22:10.078
Harley and Ivy
take over the fucking world!

22:10.162 --> 22:11.663
I'll put on the tea kettle.

22:11.747 --> 22:12.831
[kissing]

22:12.914 --> 22:16.251
Happy 19th-day anniversary.
[squeals]

22:16.334 --> 22:18.420
[theme music playing]
