WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:04.106
In New York City war on crime

00:04.137 --> 00:06.413
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:06.440 --> 00:08.886
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.909 --> 00:11.412
These are their stories.

00:12.913 --> 00:14.756
I want the kind with the stars.

00:14.781 --> 00:16.920
We only have noodles.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.396
Do I have to go to school
tomorrow if I'm still sick?

00:19.419 --> 00:22.093
No, they'll just send you home.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.434
I'm going to see if Daddy read my e-mail.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.998
Computer voice: Check your mail.

00:30.030 --> 00:33.477
- Who's sending Daddy mail?
- "SexyRita."

00:35.269 --> 00:38.113
- Who's that?
- Don't open it.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.345
Go wash up. I'll get lunch ready.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.412
Okay.

00:43.443 --> 00:46.049
Go wash up now.

01:13.173 --> 01:17.019
I'll be home by 6:30. Why? What's wrong?

01:17.044 --> 01:20.150
- Wife: Nothing.
- I can hear it in your voice.

01:20.180 --> 01:23.024
Just make sure you're home on time.

01:26.053 --> 01:29.364
These are the pension fund
files for the Mancuso meeting.

01:29.389 --> 01:31.391
Everything okay?

01:31.425 --> 01:33.837
It's just Mandy. She's on a
tear about something.

01:33.860 --> 01:36.067
So you know, she called while you were out.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.167
She wanted the "who-what-where"
of your lunch hours

01:38.198 --> 01:39.768
the last couple of weeks.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.144
- I hope you told her.
- I told her what you tell me.

01:42.169 --> 01:45.480
And I didn't mention the woman who
calls and never leaves her name.

01:45.505 --> 01:48.975
Next time Mandy calls, tell her.

01:49.009 --> 01:51.649
Tell her I told you to tell her.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.988
Okay.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.187
We can't be bulls in the old china shop here.

01:56.216 --> 01:58.287
One individual has already resigned.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.423
I pulled the records, Mr. Mancuso.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.367
You still have nearly a dozen people
whose status is questionable.

02:03.390 --> 02:06.064
I'm not signing off on the audit
until this is rectified.

02:07.327 --> 02:09.169
I understand you have a job to do.

02:09.196 --> 02:11.038
Just do your damn job.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.806
There's no need for that kind of language.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.337
You prefer some other language?

02:16.370 --> 02:19.044
How about "kickbacks"?

02:21.408 --> 02:23.888
If you don't clean it up, Mancuso,

02:23.910 --> 02:26.891
I'll bring in people who will.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.993
There's nobody, Mandy. I swear.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.023
Do I look like a stupid person?

02:36.056 --> 02:38.195
I found your personal ad on a web site.

02:38.225 --> 02:40.296
You've had it there at least a month.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.705
That's not true. That's not mine.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.938
I printed it out. Tell me that's not you.

02:49.102 --> 02:52.345
Mandy, I did not post this.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.579
I called the bank. That ad was paid

02:54.608 --> 02:57.214
by electronic check from our account, Ron.

02:59.346 --> 03:04.056
Er... Sarah's finished her bath.

03:08.555 --> 03:11.161
Come on, Billy, it's time for bed.

03:26.239 --> 03:29.015
(man rapping)
Power Company, for the meter.

03:35.982 --> 03:38.292
Oh, jeez!

03:44.191 --> 03:48.571
( theme music plays )

04:31.905 --> 04:34.977
The couple's name is Sherwood, Ron and Mandy.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.784
He works in the City Comptroller's
office. She's a part-time nurse.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.849
Two kids in grammar school--
William and Sarah.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.987
- Any domestic violence calls?
- No, never.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.997
So he chased her down here
and into the kitchen.

04:46.019 --> 04:49.125
We got what appears to be
defensive wounds on her arms.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.261
One of the first swings knocks her down.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.964
Looks like she tries to duck under the table,

04:52.993 --> 04:54.870
but he caught her in the back of the head.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.899
The leuco brought up blood spatters
clear across the room.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.241
There's a knife missing
out of the knife block.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.338
You’ll find it upstairs.

05:04.871 --> 05:07.215
( camera shutter clicks )

05:13.480 --> 05:15.960
You guys mind stepping off the carpet?

05:22.556 --> 05:25.264
I want lots of photos of the carpet--

05:25.292 --> 05:28.205
different angles, heights, okay?

05:33.300 --> 05:35.371
They're over here.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.212
This was the son. Nine years old.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.119
Suffocated with a pillow.

05:45.712 --> 05:47.953
The little girl, six years old.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.628
Put the knife against his
chest and fell on it.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.776
Suicide by stabbing. Was there a note?

06:09.803 --> 06:12.977
This whole house is a note.

06:13.006 --> 06:16.044
This was in his back pocket--
a personal ad from a web site.

06:16.076 --> 06:19.546
Sounds like it could be Sherwood's.
Could be what started the argument.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.830
He kills his wife in a rage...

06:25.852 --> 06:27.991
But the kids?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.602
No sir, they haven't made a determination yet.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.732
If it turns out it's a domestic
squabble gone haywire,

06:35.762 --> 06:37.833
we'll kick it back to the 1-0.

06:37.864 --> 06:39.901
Yes, sir.

06:39.933 --> 06:43.039
I swear I could hear him
breaking into a cold sweat.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.709
With this budget crisis,
last thing the mayor needs

06:45.739 --> 06:48.515
is a scandal with one of his accountants.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.680
Sherwood seems ready-made for the part.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.747
Last year he got a desk appearance ticket

06:52.779 --> 06:54.759
for cruising prostitutes on 26th Street.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.421
Ron Sherwood's parents are dead.
He has no siblings.

06:57.450 --> 07:00.294
But Mandy Sherwood has a mother
and sister in Wisconsin,

07:00.320 --> 07:02.800
either of who, would've been
fit guardians for the kids.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.063
And...?

07:05.091 --> 07:06.934
Men who kill their wives
usually kill their kids

07:06.960 --> 07:08.871
if there's nobody else
left to look after them.

07:08.895 --> 07:10.897
That just leaves not wanting
your kids to grow up

07:10.931 --> 07:12.877
knowing their dad's a murdering scum ball.

07:12.899 --> 07:15.277
And he cheated on their mom.
There were five e-mails

07:15.302 --> 07:17.304
from girlfriends on his Internet account.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.283
Two of them mention play dates he had

07:19.306 --> 07:21.377
during his lunch hour over the last month.

07:21.408 --> 07:24.878
Make sure Mr. Sherwood wasn't subsidizing
his fun with our tax dollars.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.889
Out of nowhere, Mrs. Sherwood just started

07:29.916 --> 07:32.419
giving me the third degree
on where he spends his lunch hour.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.363
All I know is he didn't spend it with me.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.924
Is there any reason to
believe he wasn't just...

07:36.957 --> 07:39.335
Having lunch?

07:39.359 --> 07:41.635
A few times, some woman called
and wouldn't leave her name.

07:41.661 --> 07:43.971
- Did you tell Mrs. Sherwood about her?
- No.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.999
Because Mr. Sherwood asked you not to?

07:46.032 --> 07:49.844
No. He told me next time
Mrs. Sherwood called, to tell her.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.682
What projects was he working on?

07:53.707 --> 07:55.687
Audits. He was under the gun

07:55.709 --> 07:57.814
to trim budgets in every department.

07:57.844 --> 07:59.881
He had a lot on his mind.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.189
Mr. Sherwood have a problem with his back?

08:02.215 --> 08:04.354
With his neck. Why?

08:04.384 --> 08:06.694
Well, the bookcases.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.929
Oh, right. He had me empty the top shelves

08:09.956 --> 08:12.027
because he said it hurt when he reached up.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.357
Sherwood's doctor said
he was still being treated

08:35.381 --> 08:38.294
for a pinched nerve in his neck
and pain and weakness in his left arm.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.322
The ME doesn't think Sherwood could've
swung a bat with enough force.

08:42.589 --> 08:45.331
Where's your partner?

09:01.875 --> 09:04.014
What are those lines?

09:04.044 --> 09:06.490
Marks left on the carpet by a vacuum cleaner.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.117
They're all going toward the door.

09:08.148 --> 09:11.061
Someone vacuumed this way,

09:11.084 --> 09:13.496
backing out towards the door
and right out of the house.

09:13.520 --> 09:17.297
The same pattern's on the carpet
in the master bedroom.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.735
To the door, and out to the hallway.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.568
Any chance it was done before the killings?

09:23.596 --> 09:28.875
No. There's no footprints on the carpet

09:28.902 --> 09:32.145
matching Sherwood, his wife, the kids.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.652
The prints are from our personnel.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.821
The prints that someone
didn't want us to see

09:38.845 --> 09:42.691
belong to the people
who killed the Sherwoods.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.259
Something wrong with the order, Mr. Mancuso?

09:48.288 --> 09:51.963
I don't like fish. I don't like seafood.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.597
You ought to eat fish.

09:54.627 --> 09:58.598
Salmon, sardines-- they're
filled with omega-3.

09:58.631 --> 10:01.942
Brain food. That's why my girls eat fish.

10:01.968 --> 10:05.643
Ms. Randolph, I have to tell you,

10:05.672 --> 10:08.243
I am extremely disturbed
about what happened.

10:08.274 --> 10:12.222
It is disturbing-- how a man
can lose touch with his own soul,

10:12.245 --> 10:14.851
kills the people who love him.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.487
If there are any repercussions--

10:17.517 --> 10:20.987
The only repercussion is if you lose
touch with yourself, Mr. Mancuso.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.599
I have to be home.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.372
Hold up.

10:33.399 --> 10:35.640
Your "doggie bag"?

10:41.207 --> 10:44.780
The vacuuming marks on the carpets didn't
match the Sherwood's vacuum cleaner.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.815
The one that was used was larger,
possibly an industrial model.

10:47.847 --> 10:50.885
- What about fingerprints?
- Fingerprints in the house
belonged to the family.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.726
If anybody else was here besides them,

10:52.752 --> 10:54.789
they didn't leave anything behind.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.665
You have Sherwood's shirt?

10:57.690 --> 10:59.328
Yeah.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.203
We found his blood on it, of course,

11:02.228 --> 11:03.798
and his wife’s.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.605
Goren: The bat?

11:05.632 --> 11:07.771
Mandy Sherwood was down--

11:07.800 --> 11:10.303
she was crawling under the table.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.976
If Sherwood had killed her,

11:13.006 --> 11:16.215
he'd be standing somewhere...

11:16.242 --> 11:18.654
Right about here.

11:24.651 --> 11:30.294
Ready for his next swing,
He swings at her like this,

11:30.323 --> 11:32.667
her blood splashes back toward him.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.332
He'd have blood spatter
on the right inside sleeve,

11:35.361 --> 11:37.432
the lower front of his shirt

11:37.463 --> 11:39.670
and the lower part of his left sleeve.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.414
The table would have blocked the blood

11:44.437 --> 11:46.747
from going any higher up on the left sleeve.

11:54.113 --> 11:56.252
So...

11:56.282 --> 11:59.229
Why is there blood splatter
up on his left shoulder?

11:59.252 --> 12:01.562
There shouldn't be.

12:01.588 --> 12:03.693
The blood was applied to Sherwood's shirt

12:03.723 --> 12:05.430
after Mandy Sherwood was killed.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.234
They knew enough to know
there'd be blood spatter

12:08.261 --> 12:10.832
and they got the general angle right,

12:10.863 --> 12:12.968
everything except for up on the left shoulder.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.774
A staged murder scene.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.213
Staged by somebody who knows forensics,

12:17.237 --> 12:19.376
who knows procedure.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.478
Cops?
Cops.

12:26.546 --> 12:29.152
I'm not witch-hunting cops over
a couple of blood spatters.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.425
It's not just that. The ticket
Sherwood got for cruising hookers?

12:32.452 --> 12:34.591
The officer who wrote it
conveniently passed away

12:34.621 --> 12:36.430
six months ago of a heart attack.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.094
People die.

12:38.124 --> 12:40.195
Nobody's been able to find the paperwork,

12:40.226 --> 12:42.365
and nobody can locate a copy of the affidavit.

12:42.395 --> 12:45.137
Then there's Sherwood's pen-pals
from the personals web site--

12:45.164 --> 12:49.078
they're all dummy accounts
paid for with cribbed credit cards.

12:50.236 --> 12:53.183
We're being gas lighted by professionals.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.277
They needed to get rid of Sherwood,

12:55.308 --> 12:57.345
they invented a cover story.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.880
"The sex-obsessed milk-toast

12:59.912 --> 13:03.792
who slaughters his family
and suicides himself

13:03.816 --> 13:06.797
in an orgy of shame and guilt."

13:06.819 --> 13:08.924
But cops killing a whole family?

13:08.955 --> 13:11.094
Planting a summons on our system

13:11.124 --> 13:13.627
is a tall order for a civilian.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.266
Cops it is.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.799
Somewhere along the line,

13:18.831 --> 13:21.505
Sherwood got on their bad side.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.519
None of Sherwood's audits
touched on the police department.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.044
The biggest fish he was frying
was the tax assessor's office.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.683
Sherwood probably wasn't killed
by a bunch of tax assessors.

13:33.713 --> 13:36.091
What about this memo
to the city pension department?

13:36.115 --> 13:38.652
That was in connection
with an audit he was doing

13:38.685 --> 13:40.426
of the City School Security Division.

13:40.453 --> 13:43.195
Some of their security officers
are retired city workers.

13:43.222 --> 13:46.692
And some of the city workers
in this memo are retired cops.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.865
Eames: I know what Sherwood was looking for

13:48.895 --> 13:51.933
“Double dippers.” My old man
got in trouble for doing it.

13:51.964 --> 13:53.910
When he retired from the force,

13:53.933 --> 13:56.209
he got a job with the City Parks
working with kids.

13:56.235 --> 13:59.375
He was drawing a pension from the city
while working full-time for the city.

13:59.405 --> 14:02.909
It's a no-no. It's cops and money.

14:04.911 --> 14:07.050
I had two meetings with Mr. Sherwood.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.253
I like to keep things agreeable,

14:09.282 --> 14:12.161
but he was "fists up" right from the start.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.826
Right-- what's so disagreeable about ex-cops

14:15.855 --> 14:18.267
taking the city for a ride?

14:19.392 --> 14:22.965
- I'm sorry?
- The double-dipping, Mr. Mancuso.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.802
We got that all sorted out.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.677
I asked the individual
involved for his resignation.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.773
Eames: Any fines or restitution?

14:31.804 --> 14:35.274
No. I made a determination
it was unnecessarily punitive.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.050
That's awfully agreeable of you.

14:39.078 --> 14:41.786
What about the other dozen security officers

14:41.814 --> 14:44.055
whose pension records
Sherwood was examining?

14:45.318 --> 14:47.491
Those were just clerical errors,

14:47.520 --> 14:49.830
forms that hadn't been properly filled out.

14:49.856 --> 14:52.564
Well, you must be a very...

14:54.360 --> 14:56.897
Agreeable guy to work for, Mr. Mancuso.

14:57.930 --> 15:00.604
I like to think of myself as fair.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.807
These are brave men who put
their lives on the line for the city.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.941
They deserve the benefit of the doubt.

15:05.972 --> 15:08.077
If you don't mind, we'd like the name

15:08.107 --> 15:10.747
of the "brave man" who resigned.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.916
Those pension rules are a bunch of crap.

15:12.945 --> 15:15.016
My partner's with you on that.

15:15.047 --> 15:18.620
- My old man got caught in the same bind.
- No kidding?

15:18.651 --> 15:21.188
Except he had to pay back
nearly $50 grand to the city.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.359
How'd you get away clean?

15:23.389 --> 15:25.232
"Clean" nothing. I gave up a good job.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.999
All I got now is the pension.

15:27.026 --> 15:29.836
Hasn't kept you from living large, Phil.
What have you got in here?

15:29.862 --> 15:31.933
Prime rib. Wow!

15:31.964 --> 15:34.774
Is that a lobster wiggling around down there?

15:34.801 --> 15:36.838
- It's--
- Get out of my stuff!

15:36.869 --> 15:39.315
What is this? It's a $50 bottle of wine!

15:39.338 --> 15:41.511
Here's what we think, Mr. Legrand.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.521
You and your double-dipping buddies

15:43.543 --> 15:45.454
were kicking back your wages to Mancuso,

15:45.478 --> 15:47.549
but when Sherwood started sniffing around,

15:47.580 --> 15:49.355
Mancuso got nervous.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.885
He needed to throw Sherwood a bone.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.864
You guys drew straws. You came up short

15:53.886 --> 15:57.060
and now your buddies are taking care of you.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.272
But one resignation wasn't
enough for Sherwood, right?

16:01.294 --> 16:04.070
So your buddy-boys did something about him.

16:04.096 --> 16:07.305
You guys...

16:07.333 --> 16:09.472
I wanted to make dinner
for my girlfriend, all right?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.607
I couldn't afford what she likes,

16:11.637 --> 16:13.674
so she gave me the money for these groceries.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.617
That's who's taking care of me.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.281
So now that I've humiliated myself,

16:18.311 --> 16:21.758
why don't you take your
Mutt-and-Jeff act off my property?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.923
Gee, I need a hankie.

16:27.954 --> 16:32.369
Don't feel too sorry for him.
Did you see this?

16:32.391 --> 16:34.735
"Sullivan River Homeowners Association"?

16:34.760 --> 16:37.536
Somebody's got himself
a nice home in the country.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.770
He's made more recent purchases.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.803
Brand new trailer hitch...

16:42.835 --> 16:47.580
For a boat-- a big one.
The dealer's name's on it.

16:48.774 --> 16:50.447
Phil isn't handling it well.

16:50.476 --> 16:53.013
I heard it in his voice.
Those detectives rattled him.

16:53.045 --> 16:56.618
Maybe he ought to take his boat out
on the river, calm himself down.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.562
I don't know, Terry. CSU's still
crawling all over the Sherwood's place--

16:59.585 --> 17:03.294
I know all about that.
Now stop your worrying.

17:03.322 --> 17:05.393
It's like what I tell my girls--

17:05.424 --> 17:09.304
"Don't suffer future pain. Take
care of business here and now."

17:09.328 --> 17:12.069
Jakes: Hola, here he comes.

17:13.598 --> 17:16.239
Hold it! Hold up! Stay right there!

17:16.269 --> 17:18.407
Hold up!

17:25.144 --> 17:27.282
Hey, Officer Terry, chill!

17:27.313 --> 17:29.793
You chill, moron. You're late.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.954
Come on, I got detention.

17:31.984 --> 17:34.555
You're going to be on permanent
detention if you don't wise up.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.589
You're a day late. Now let's go.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.863
I got it, I got it.

17:42.194 --> 17:44.333
That's my working capital!

17:44.363 --> 17:47.003
That's a fine you pay for
trying to duck me, amigo.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.172
Damn, lady, you ain't even a real cop.

17:52.638 --> 17:56.677
But you're a real dope
dealer, and I am a badge.

17:56.709 --> 18:00.088
And I have the authority to arrest
you, pacify you and mess you up--

18:00.112 --> 18:02.592
and that's before I turn
you over to the real cops.

18:02.615 --> 18:06.085
You and your colleagues
live and breathe at my pleasure.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.655
Remember that.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.463
Man: Stolen right out of his driveway?

18:12.491 --> 18:14.937
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.998
Mr. Legrand took delivery
just a couple of weeks ago.

18:17.029 --> 18:20.704
Yeah, it's a shame. We need a copy of
the sales contract, for our report.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.680
Sure. He bought a 30-footer,

18:23.703 --> 18:25.546
all the amenities you can imagine.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.812
How much? Just under a $100 grand.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.286
- How'd he pay?
- Oh, installments.

18:30.309 --> 18:33.688
- How many installments?
- I'd have to look at the contract.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.592
Off the top of your head, Mel--

18:36.616 --> 18:39.460
more than one installment?

18:39.485 --> 18:42.557
( laughs ) Yeah, of course.

18:42.588 --> 18:46.229
- Less than 10?
- Could be.

18:46.258 --> 18:48.260
Was it check or cash, Mel?

18:49.261 --> 18:51.400
I don't really--

18:51.430 --> 18:54.001
You don't really? He doesn't really--

18:54.033 --> 18:56.274
We'll just assume it was cash.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.840
- When was the last payment made?
- Yesterday.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.375
Has it been deposited yet?

19:02.408 --> 19:07.289
There's a chance it could
be in the safe still.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.760
- Eames: Let's take a look.
- Okay.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.161
Our lab took a look at the
cash you gave the boat dealer.

19:13.185 --> 19:15.825
They found traces of Ecstasy and ketamine.

19:15.855 --> 19:18.529
High school party drugs, Phil.

19:18.557 --> 19:21.868
What were you doing? Selling drugs to
kids you were getting paid to protect?

19:21.894 --> 19:24.340
I know the drill. I don't
have to say anything.

19:29.568 --> 19:32.742
Forget about the drugs, forget about the cash,

19:32.772 --> 19:34.911
all you need to remember is the number four.

19:49.321 --> 19:51.460
Four murders.

19:51.490 --> 19:55.734
Four counts of conspiracy...

19:58.731 --> 20:01.610
Four bites at the death penalty.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.876
I want my lawyer.

20:04.904 --> 20:09.353
- Who went in their house, Phil?
- I want to go back to my cell.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.087
It wasn't him.

20:19.251 --> 20:22.232
He doesn't have the front for it.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.726
26 years on the force,
you never got out of the back.

20:27.993 --> 20:31.065
You took the sergeant's exam
once, you never finished it.

20:32.698 --> 20:36.339
Everything in your file says...

20:38.170 --> 20:40.616
"worker bee."

20:44.510 --> 20:47.150
So who gave you orders?

20:47.179 --> 20:49.250
I want to go back to my cell

20:49.281 --> 20:51.283
or I'm going to file a complaint.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.354
Phil, do you see what's
happening to you here?

20:53.385 --> 20:55.387
Don't you want to get out from under this?

20:59.925 --> 21:02.872
Goren: Just tell us you had
nothing to do with this directly

21:02.895 --> 21:05.842
and we'll go with that.

21:05.865 --> 21:08.072
Just talk to us.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.940
I want to go back to my cell.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.032
Guy's been around the dance floor too often.

21:40.065 --> 21:43.239
The search team called
from his place up in the Catskills.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.875
They found another $100 grand in cash.

21:45.905 --> 21:49.182
We've got a very enterprising
crew of security guards.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.552
( gunshot blasts )

21:56.615 --> 21:58.720
We need an EMS team up here right away.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.302
What the hell happened here?

22:13.332 --> 22:15.608
We just got the cuffs off, Captain.

22:15.634 --> 22:19.514
He just grabbed my weapon out of
the holster and blew himself away.

22:19.538 --> 22:22.280
There was nothing I could do.

22:23.542 --> 22:27.046
Okay, Johnston, just go out
and sit in the squad room.

22:43.128 --> 22:45.665
No, sir, I take full responsibility.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.537
Things are going to get
real pleasant around here,

22:50.569 --> 22:52.845
so if you have any good news,
now is the time to share it.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.682
We're looking for someone
with an alpha personality--

22:55.708 --> 22:59.019
with the organizational skills
to plan the Sherwood murders

22:59.044 --> 23:02.025
and the ruthlessness to carry them out;

23:03.048 --> 23:05.551
the knowledge…

23:05.584 --> 23:08.224
to plant disinformation…

23:08.254 --> 23:10.325
about Sherwood.

23:12.825 --> 23:15.533
Maybe it's someone with a military background.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.599
There is a platoon dynamic here.

23:18.631 --> 23:22.977
When they cut Legrand loose,
they took care of him

23:23.002 --> 23:25.505
by giving him cash and a new boat.

23:27.539 --> 23:31.544
Legrand repaid that loyalty
by killing himself.

23:31.577 --> 23:34.524
Death before dishonor?

23:35.714 --> 23:38.661
Come on, this guy was afraid
of spending the rest of his life in jail.

23:38.684 --> 23:42.826
You read his file. As a
cop, the guy was... average.

23:42.855 --> 23:46.769
They'll probably all turn out
to have average service records--

23:48.093 --> 23:51.700
cops who feel they never got their due--

23:51.730 --> 23:53.835
who feel they need to prove something.

23:53.866 --> 23:57.075
They decided to be the best
bad cops they could be.

23:58.404 --> 24:01.146
Smoke the bastards out.

24:03.175 --> 24:04.950
Eames: And this guy got forensic experience

24:04.977 --> 24:07.548
when he was in the force. He goes here.

24:07.579 --> 24:09.923
Here's a Desert Storm veteran.

24:09.949 --> 24:13.897
This guy got suspended from the
department for procedural mistakes.

24:13.919 --> 24:17.093
A disaffected cop. He's got potential.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.466
So does this one: 3 years in the Marines--

24:22.928 --> 24:25.966
12 years on the force,
retired on a disability

24:25.998 --> 24:29.571
with the rank of Sergeant.

24:29.601 --> 24:31.945
He took courses in computers.

24:31.971 --> 24:35.350
He was attached at various
times to 2 CSU teams.

24:42.848 --> 24:47.228
Well. Kept getting turned down
for a spot on the Detective Bureau.

24:47.252 --> 24:51.064
Terry Randolph.

24:51.090 --> 24:54.230
He's been with the School
Security almost two years.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.704
He was Phil Legrand's supervisor.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.803
Well, here's one reason
why Randolph might've been

25:01.834 --> 25:06.078
denied for detective--
Terry Randolph's a woman.

25:06.105 --> 25:09.450
Funny how that detail escaped
your powers of observation.

25:09.475 --> 25:11.546
Well, we need to talk

25:11.577 --> 25:14.387
to whoever was her rabbi on the force.

25:17.649 --> 25:19.925
I haven't been in touch
with Terry for many years.

25:19.952 --> 25:22.956
- How'd you hook up with her?
- I gave a class at the academy.

25:22.988 --> 25:25.366
She was a recruit with more
questions than I had answers.

25:25.391 --> 25:27.769
A year later, she called me

25:27.793 --> 25:30.399
for a recommendation to a street crime unit.

25:30.429 --> 25:32.932
I saw in her file she volunteered
for a lot of overtime.

25:32.965 --> 25:35.138
Did she have money pressures?

25:35.167 --> 25:37.238
She was a single mother with two kids.

25:37.269 --> 25:39.306
What about on the job? You
said she was in a hurry.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.375
Did she like quick fixes?

25:41.407 --> 25:43.819
She was efficient, very territorial.

25:43.842 --> 25:46.083
To get respect from the street,

25:46.111 --> 25:48.250
she would pick out the baddest
homeboy on the corner,

25:48.280 --> 25:50.419
put the bracelets on him,

25:50.449 --> 25:52.656
then take him to a quiet place
for a beat-down.

25:52.684 --> 25:55.563
Why are you investigating her?

25:55.587 --> 25:57.965
The Sherwood family murders.

25:57.990 --> 26:01.665
There's a connection to corruption
in the School Security Division.

26:01.693 --> 26:04.799
Well, I know she's a hothead,
but I can't imagine

26:04.830 --> 26:08.209
Terry would be involved
with anything like that.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.509
Terry was a smart, driven young officer

26:10.536 --> 26:12.311
who was denied advancement,

26:12.337 --> 26:15.079
a promotion that would've
brought her a raise.

26:15.107 --> 26:18.111
That breeds bitterness,
a sense of entitlement.

26:18.143 --> 26:20.521
I know it does.

26:20.546 --> 26:23.959
I always hoped that Terry
wouldn't be defeated by it.

26:23.982 --> 26:26.622
( knocking on door )
Excuse me.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.359
Randolph's hitting all the marks.

26:32.391 --> 26:35.167
Not to mention, she's territorial.

26:36.161 --> 26:38.368
Let's go mark up her territory.

26:39.398 --> 26:41.400
Listen, I don't know no Phil Legrand, okay?

26:41.433 --> 26:43.379
I don't even mess around with dope.

26:43.402 --> 26:45.678
We just saw you hand off
a blunt to one of your buddies.

26:45.704 --> 26:47.581
That was a cigarette. I swear.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.917
A cigarette? You're in deep serious now, kid.

26:50.943 --> 26:54.288
- Those things will kill you.
- Heads up.

26:56.548 --> 26:59.688
( yelling ) You don't spit out a
name in the next five seconds,

26:59.718 --> 27:02.164
I'm going to play dodge ball with your head!

27:02.187 --> 27:04.793
- What is going on here?
- Official business.

27:04.823 --> 27:06.063
We're interviewing witnesses.

27:06.091 --> 27:08.697
Nobody notified the security
division you'd be interviewing

27:08.727 --> 27:10.035
Witnesses on school property.

27:10.062 --> 27:14.636
Oh-- I didn't know we needed to
check with the security guards.

27:14.666 --> 27:16.304
Security officers.

27:16.335 --> 27:20.147
The security officers. A sergeant, no less.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.810
Cluster Sergeant Terry Randolph.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.320
You were Phil Legrand's supervisor.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.584
Yes, ma'am.

27:26.612 --> 27:28.649
Thanks for your help, kid.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.217
You lay off the smokes.

27:32.551 --> 27:35.054
Can we talk to you about Phil?

27:41.894 --> 27:44.340
All I can tell you is
Legrand did his job well.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.309
About his psychological
problems, I can't say.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.743
Actually...

27:48.767 --> 27:51.077
Randolph, he had other problems.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.777
Detective, I prefer being
addressed by my rank.

27:53.805 --> 27:56.183
Cluster Sergeant?

27:56.208 --> 27:58.814
Sergeant Randolph, Legrand was
involved in drug dealing.

27:58.844 --> 28:01.120
I'm surprised to hear that.

28:01.146 --> 28:04.616
Oh, it went on right under your nose.

28:07.252 --> 28:09.755
Right. Well, you talk to her.

28:09.788 --> 28:12.291
Sergeant, we'd appreciate
any guidance you can give us.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.634
Hah-- guidance?!

28:14.660 --> 28:18.369
Could you tell your partner
I'm a 12-year-veteran of the NYPD?

28:18.397 --> 28:20.707
That I attained the rank of Sergeant?

28:20.732 --> 28:23.008
( Goren laughing )

28:23.035 --> 28:24.446
- Look at you now!
- Goren, knock it off.

28:24.469 --> 28:27.814
Go ahead and laugh,
but I got a record to stand on.

28:27.839 --> 28:29.614
Since I took over, crime on school property

28:29.641 --> 28:31.621
in my district has dropped 50%.

28:32.978 --> 28:35.959
- It's just good timing.
- It's respect, Detective.

28:35.981 --> 28:38.552
I know how to earn it.
I earned it from these kids.

28:42.888 --> 28:45.732
Nice talking to you, ma'am.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.805
She "earned respect."

28:50.829 --> 28:55.369
I wonder which bad homeboy
she beat down to earn it.

28:58.704 --> 29:00.741
Man: Rudy Suarez is still an open case.

29:00.772 --> 29:02.683
You didn't mention it in your phone call,

29:02.708 --> 29:04.881
but I got you the autopsy anyway.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.481
We like to kid the school
security people around,

29:07.512 --> 29:09.617
but you got to admit,
they've done a good job.

29:09.648 --> 29:12.629
Especially Terry Randolph.
The crime statistics don't lie.

29:12.651 --> 29:14.790
It doesn't hurt that Rudy Suarez--

29:14.820 --> 29:17.767
the baddest dope dealer in her high
schools-- was killed last year.

29:17.789 --> 29:21.066
Yeah, right. Shot in his bedroom with
his girlfriend, execution-style.

29:21.093 --> 29:25.439
That's the way the locals take each other out.
They see it in the movies.

29:26.832 --> 29:28.869
The living room carpet was vacuumed.

29:33.138 --> 29:35.584
And look...

29:35.607 --> 29:37.678
On the kitchen floor.

29:37.709 --> 29:40.781
Somebody sprayed leuco on the floor
looking for blood evidence.

29:40.812 --> 29:42.883
Yeah, Well, CSU did that.

29:42.914 --> 29:45.758
This report says that CSU
sprayed leuco in the bedroom.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.390
It says they sprayed it in the bathroom.

29:48.420 --> 29:51.424
It doesn't say they sprayed it
in the kitchen.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.237
Randolph and her crew killed Suarez.

29:56.261 --> 29:58.707
That's how she got a handle
on the dope trade in her schools.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.767
They killed Sherwood and his family

30:00.799 --> 30:03.143
because his investigation might've uncovered

30:03.168 --> 30:05.205
the dope dealing and the Suarez murders.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.376
The only thing you've got in common

30:07.406 --> 30:09.477
between the murders is a vacuumed rug.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.920
There's also leuco crystal violet.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.349
Randolph might've sprayed it in the kitchen

30:16.381 --> 30:19.794
at the Suarez place when she was
cleaning up the murder scene.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.957
She also used it at the Sherwood home.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.331
Forensics found leuco where it
hadn't been sprayed by our people.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.893
Goren: Leuco is made in batches.

30:26.925 --> 30:30.896
Each batch has unique
chemical characteristics.

30:30.929 --> 30:35.674
If we find out which batch
Randolph's leuco belongs to,

30:35.701 --> 30:38.079
we can trace it through
the serial numbers on the cans.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.982
We just need leuco samples from all
the CSU teams she trained with.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.878
I'll get a "49" up to the Chief of Detectives.

30:44.910 --> 30:47.891
All it needs is your signature.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.461
I'm not going to discuss it with you.

30:51.483 --> 30:53.861
Until I say different,
you are too young to wear lipstick.

30:53.885 --> 30:56.798
- But Nyeesha wears lipstick.
- Nyeesha's a neighborhood girl.

30:56.822 --> 30:58.699
If I wanted you to be a neighborhood girl,

30:58.724 --> 31:00.465
I'd send you to a neighborhood school.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.563
Your mother works hard
to pay for your schooling.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.870
- You should be thankful.
- I don't want gratitude.

31:04.896 --> 31:07.467
I want them to have
opportunities I didn't have.

31:10.635 --> 31:13.445
Now, there's nothing special
about a girl who wears lipstick.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.975
And you and your sister are special girls

31:16.007 --> 31:18.886
who have claim on every
special thing in this world.

31:18.910 --> 31:21.857
Hmm?

31:22.881 --> 31:25.862
Now go wash up.

31:27.486 --> 31:29.762
( cell phone rings )

31:32.758 --> 31:34.760
Yes?

31:34.793 --> 31:36.795
Yes, hello.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.237
Repeat that again.

31:43.468 --> 31:47.678
No, I'm sure it's just routine.
Thanks for telling me.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.209
Oh, how's your granddaughter?

31:51.743 --> 31:53.950
That's good to hear.

31:53.979 --> 31:56.425
Thank you.

31:59.618 --> 32:02.963
Mom, I'm going to the store.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.130
Eames: Which one of you is Arliss?

32:10.162 --> 32:11.266
I am.

32:11.296 --> 32:13.105
We need to see your supply of leuco.

32:13.131 --> 32:17.273
Sure. I got cans in my kit
here and in the van.

32:17.302 --> 32:20.749
You ever work with Terry Randolph?
She was a patrol officer.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.013
I might, I don't know.

32:23.041 --> 32:25.282
Her service record says

32:25.310 --> 32:28.416
you did a six-month
training stint with her in '96.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.949
Could be.

32:29.981 --> 32:33.451
These cans are the wrong batch numbers.

32:33.485 --> 32:36.864
Same here. Just get these cans?

32:36.888 --> 32:39.129
Yeah, I ran out a couple of days ago.

32:39.157 --> 32:41.296
The quartermaster's records
say you should have

32:41.326 --> 32:45.274
at least eight cans left
with this batch number.

32:45.297 --> 32:48.403
Must be a clerical mistake. Sorry.

32:51.903 --> 32:55.851
"Clerical mistake," my ass.
She got to him.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.450
According to the supply records,

33:01.480 --> 33:03.687
Arliss got his new cans
of leuco on Wednesday.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.719
Which means he was tipped off
Tuesday or Wednesday morning.

33:06.751 --> 33:10.289
Which means the leaks are coming
from somewhere in this building.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.461
I checked who the requisition went to

33:12.491 --> 33:14.801
in the Chief of Detectives' office,
besides, of course,

33:14.826 --> 33:17.102
the Chief of Detectives.

33:17.128 --> 33:19.506
I can vouch for his assistant.

33:19.531 --> 33:22.512
Denise? You dog.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.571
I need tracking information

33:24.603 --> 33:28.574
on requisition number 2436-17,
sent last Tuesday.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.417
Who in your office handled that requisition?

33:31.443 --> 33:33.821
Spell that.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.916
Thank you.

33:35.947 --> 33:38.450
Randolph's file.

33:42.053 --> 33:44.192
There.

33:51.997 --> 33:54.136
Go for a walk?

33:55.834 --> 33:58.178
Meet Cecilia Wang,

33:58.203 --> 34:01.275
a.k.a. "Deep Throat."

34:12.384 --> 34:15.991
Randolph pinched her granddaughter
in a drug sweep four years ago.

34:16.021 --> 34:18.194
The charges were dismissed
after Randolph didn't show up

34:18.223 --> 34:20.260
to testify at the grand jury.

34:20.292 --> 34:23.273
Randolph did her a favor.
And Mrs. Wang's paying it back.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.400
Bring Mrs. Wang in. Threaten her with--

34:25.429 --> 34:28.603
off the top of my head, I can think
of a dozen statutes she's violated.

34:28.632 --> 34:31.306
The most we'll get from her
is that she tipped off Terry Randolph

34:31.335 --> 34:33.815
about the requisition for leuco samples.

34:33.838 --> 34:35.840
Then put that CSU technician
through the wringer.

34:35.873 --> 34:38.980
Or the head of the School
Security Division, Mancuso.

34:39.010 --> 34:41.183
Besides the fact that we
have no leverage against them,

34:41.212 --> 34:43.283
I doubt they have any firsthand knowledge

34:43.315 --> 34:45.761
of the murders. All they
could offer is hearsay.

34:45.784 --> 34:48.924
Then find Randolph's accomplices--
the other ex-cops.

34:48.954 --> 34:50.661
Accomplice testimony with no corroboration?

34:50.688 --> 34:52.532
The drug dealers they've been shaking down?

34:52.556 --> 34:54.867
Witnesses credibility problems.

34:57.429 --> 35:00.239
You'd make a hell of a defense attorney.

35:02.534 --> 35:04.571
Randolph's the main domino.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.675
We make her fall, they all fall.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.016
The best way--

35:10.041 --> 35:12.612
the most certain way--

35:12.644 --> 35:16.217
is if she implicates herself.

35:17.215 --> 35:19.456
And you have a plan?

35:22.954 --> 35:25.958
It speaks to your good character
you have qualms about this scheme.

35:25.991 --> 35:28.528
You already have a legitimate search warrant.

35:28.560 --> 35:32.337
Why do you need me to phony
up official documents?

35:32.364 --> 35:34.810
Lieutenant, I knew you'd have concerns

35:34.833 --> 35:36.972
about the legality of this plan.

35:37.002 --> 35:40.814
I'm here to assure you
we're on solid ground.

35:40.839 --> 35:44.309
I have concerns that you're going
after the wrong person for murder.

35:44.342 --> 35:48.882
Well, this is one way to find out, isn't it?

35:54.653 --> 35:56.792
Grandmother: Be careful over there.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.563
I'm sure he knows what he's doing.

36:02.527 --> 36:04.666
No argument here.

36:07.465 --> 36:09.877
Nice house.

36:09.901 --> 36:12.108
How'd you swing it?

36:12.137 --> 36:14.549
Randolph: That's none of your business.

36:16.574 --> 36:19.680
It's just an innocent question.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.214
There's nothing innocent
about that baby face.

36:22.247 --> 36:25.057
I had savings from my late husband,

36:25.083 --> 36:28.929
and Terry had savings.
That's how we paid for it.

36:28.953 --> 36:30.933
We're done. The place is clean.

36:30.955 --> 36:33.697
I'm not done yet.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.534
(sighs)

36:39.464 --> 36:41.774
Your girls--

36:41.800 --> 36:44.212
they go to Maryhill?

36:46.337 --> 36:50.217
That's $10,000-- $15,000 a year for each.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.054
How do you afford it?

36:55.080 --> 36:57.617
If something's important
enough, you find a way.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.185
We're very frugal.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.493
Oh.

37:01.519 --> 37:06.195
Oh, my partner's a miser, I'm frugal--

37:06.224 --> 37:10.832
and neither of us could afford a house,
two kids in a private school--

37:10.862 --> 37:13.138
You're not that frugal.

37:16.034 --> 37:19.447
You buy nice clothes, pay full price,

37:19.471 --> 37:21.678
nothing in your size is ever on sale.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.617
You buy good quality accessories,

37:24.642 --> 37:26.713
like that leather case.

37:26.745 --> 37:29.316
You're not married,
so you spend money on dates.

37:29.347 --> 37:31.759
You like good food.

37:31.783 --> 37:34.787
You have someone in
to clean your apartment every week.

37:34.819 --> 37:37.663
You're smart, have lots of
interests and hobbies

37:37.689 --> 37:39.669
and you spend a fortune on them.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.967
I don't wonder that you don't
have money for a house.

37:41.993 --> 37:44.496
I wonder how you make subway fare
the way you spend money.

37:57.609 --> 38:00.215
That's pretty good, Randolph...

38:03.148 --> 38:06.391
But you didn't answer my question.

38:13.525 --> 38:15.562
How can she afford private school?

38:15.593 --> 38:18.665
- Leave my mother alone.
- Where does the money come from?

38:18.696 --> 38:21.700
She works hard.

38:24.836 --> 38:27.112
She murders dope dealers

38:27.138 --> 38:29.516
and steals their-- their money.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.282
She murdered a whole family--

38:31.309 --> 38:33.152
- That's enough!
- Where does she keep the cash?

38:33.178 --> 38:34.657
Just tell me where she keeps the cash!

38:34.679 --> 38:37.319
Goren!

38:37.348 --> 38:39.624
I need to talk to you.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.537
- You're out of line.
- She's a disgrace to the uniform.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.672
We're hitting dead ends.
Doesn't that tell you something?

38:54.999 --> 38:57.001
We're not wrong about her.

38:57.035 --> 39:00.244
You heard what they said at the 2-7.

39:00.271 --> 39:03.150
Eames: We're done here. Okay? We're going.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.154
I'm sorry for my partner.

39:13.184 --> 39:16.165
There's no reason for animosity.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.690
You know, I still have
a lot of friends in the department.

39:18.723 --> 39:21.499
Well, watch your back.

39:26.464 --> 39:29.308
"To Ronald Carver,
District Attorney's Office,

39:29.334 --> 39:31.871
in re: Sherwood family murders.

39:31.903 --> 39:36.909
Per your request, I reviewed
my files concerning Terry Randolph

39:36.941 --> 39:39.649
and discovered incriminating information

39:39.677 --> 39:41.782
pertinent to your investigation.

39:41.813 --> 39:44.225
You can access this information

39:44.249 --> 39:46.752
on the department database,

39:46.784 --> 39:49.094
under archive number:

39:49.120 --> 39:51.964
7-4-7-7-2.

39:51.990 --> 39:56.268
Signed, Lieutenant
Anita Van Buren, 27th Precinct."

39:56.294 --> 39:59.935
Cover copy to the Chief of Detectives.

40:07.171 --> 40:09.310
It's Cecilia.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.513
You're asking about correspondence

40:11.542 --> 40:14.216
from the 27th Precinct?

40:14.245 --> 40:16.418
I found one.

40:17.982 --> 40:20.622
Evening, Morris. You got
everything locked down?

40:20.652 --> 40:22.791
Yes, ma'am. I just did my rounds.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.959
All right, I have to check up on you now.

40:24.989 --> 40:27.333
I'll be back in 15.

40:31.329 --> 40:33.832
( radio chatter )

41:46.104 --> 41:48.846
( siren effect wails )

41:52.977 --> 41:55.116
( door bangs )

41:57.782 --> 41:59.921
That's your virtual arrest.

41:59.951 --> 42:02.090
And this is your actual one.

42:03.955 --> 42:07.903
This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.

42:07.925 --> 42:12.203
You stole a confidential police file.
That's grand larceny.

42:12.230 --> 42:16.474
An overt act in furtherance
of a conspiracy to commit murder.

42:16.501 --> 42:18.845
You see, one of my hobbies

42:18.870 --> 42:22.044
is studying the laws
you were once paid to enforce.

42:26.177 --> 42:29.158
It's surprisingly cheap.

42:29.180 --> 42:32.389
Please, don't take my girls away from me!

42:34.852 --> 42:38.129
I did it for them.
I sacrifice everything for them.

42:42.293 --> 42:45.570
The Sherwood family sacrificed their lives.

42:45.596 --> 42:48.372
Four innocent lives.

42:50.034 --> 42:52.241
Two children you smothered

42:52.270 --> 42:56.047
with the same hands you tuck your
daughters in bed with at night.

42:59.310 --> 43:01.381
I don't know if it's a good thing

43:01.412 --> 43:04.120
or a bad thing that you won't be around

43:04.148 --> 43:06.992
as a role model for them anymore.

43:20.698 --> 43:23.508
The best intentions.

43:36.881 --> 43:40.226
( theme music plays )

43:41.305 --> 43:47.659
