50:00.957 --> 50:05.872
That you are an abomination,
just like the Vampire Bible states.

50:07.338 --> 50:10.546
Bill, you are stronger than this.

50:10.717 --> 50:15.381
You are capable of sympathy
and kindness and generosity.

50:16.014 --> 50:19.848
You are unique among all the vampires
I've met.

50:20.393 --> 50:21.678
Don't throw that away.

50:26.232 --> 50:30.396
I have Spent my entire life
as a vampire apologizing...

50:30.862 --> 50:34.104
...believing I was
inherently wrong somehow.

50:35.366 --> 50:37.402
Living in fear.

50:38.369 --> 50:42.863
Fear that God had forsaken me,
that I was damned.

50:44.667 --> 50:47.534
But Lilith grants us freedom from fear.

50:48.379 --> 50:50.586
Vicissitudes, 9:24.

50:51.549 --> 50:55.667
FearnoL
for my blood is beyond fear...

50:55.845 --> 50:58.837
...fear of sin, fear of mankind...

50:59.432 --> 51:01.514
...fear of retribution.

51:01.684 --> 51:04.517
For thou art begat by God...

51:05.271 --> 51:08.934
...and this world is but a spring
to slake thy sacred thirst!

51:11.819 --> 51:13.855
If I ever...

51:14.030 --> 51:16.567
...meant anything to you at all--

51:16.741 --> 51:19.608
I told you the first night we met.

51:20.828 --> 51:24.571
Vampires often turn on those
they love the most.

51:34.968 --> 51:37.550
[BILL GRUNTING]

51:37.720 --> 51:39.426
BILL:
Oh, God.

51:47.563 --> 51:49.690
Oh, God!

52:01.202 --> 52:04.694
[SOOKIE SOBBING]

52:09.335 --> 52:11.121
