WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.234
WE FIGHT.

00:03.234 --> 00:05.036
NO, WE DON'T.

00:05.036 --> 00:07.208
YOU YELL
AND THEN YOU GO SILENT.

00:07.208 --> 00:10.181
I YELL BECAUSE YOU...

00:10.181 --> 00:13.013
(clears throat)
WE DON'T COMMUNICATE.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.146
THERE'S NO INTIMACY.

00:15.146 --> 00:16.347
THERE'S INTIMACY.

00:16.347 --> 00:18.219
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S INTIMACY,

00:18.219 --> 00:20.291
BUT WE'RE NOT
ON THE SAME PAGE.

00:20.291 --> 00:22.153
(chuckles) OH, BE--
BECAUSE I DON'T DO

00:22.153 --> 00:23.294
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO.

00:23.294 --> 00:25.156
BECAUSE YOU HAD AN ABORTION.

00:25.156 --> 00:28.359
(clock ticking)

00:28.359 --> 00:31.031
UH, WE'VE DONE
COUPLES THERAPY BEFORE.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.103
HE HAS P.T.S.D.

00:32.103 --> 00:33.304
FROM THE WAR,
AND SHE'S HAD IT, TOO.

00:33.304 --> 00:35.136
FROM THE SHOOTING,
BUT NOT AT THE SAME TIME.

00:35.136 --> 00:38.038
WE--WE DIDN'T HAVE IT
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.411
AND MINE WASN'T AS BAD
AS HIS IS.

00:40.411 --> 00:43.114
YOU LAY ON THE FLOOR
OF AN O.R.

00:43.114 --> 00:45.076
YOU CHOKED ME.
YOU QUIT BEING A DOCTOR.

00:45.076 --> 00:47.047
SO...

00:47.047 --> 00:48.249
(ticking continues)

00:48.249 --> 00:50.050
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.322
UH, BUT NOW WE'RE FINE.

00:51.322 --> 00:53.184
(scoffs)

00:53.184 --> 00:55.186
(chuckles)

00:55.186 --> 00:56.327
REALLY?

00:56.327 --> 00:58.289
OH, SURE. OKAY.
WE'RE FINE.

00:58.289 --> 01:00.060
I MEANT THE P.T.S.D.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.263
OKAY. YEAH.
WE'RE FINE.

01:02.263 --> 01:05.266
(ticking continues)

01:07.098 --> 01:08.169
WE'RE FINE.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.370
MM-HMM.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.172
EXCEPT FOR THE PART
WHERE YOU ABORTED

01:11.172 --> 01:12.373
THE CHILD THAT I WANTED.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.175
EXCEPT FOR THE PART
WHERE YOU HELD MY HAND

01:14.175 --> 01:15.406
WHILE I EXERCISED
MY RIGHT TO CHOOSE

01:15.406 --> 01:18.149
AND THEN FOUR MONTHS LATER,
YOU SCREAMED I KILLED YOUR BABY

01:18.149 --> 01:20.181
IN FRONT OF ALL OUR FRIENDS.

01:20.181 --> 01:23.083
(Meredith)
WHEN YOU'VE TRIED EVERYTHING

01:23.083 --> 01:25.286
BUT THAT HEADACHE
WON'T GO AWAY,

01:25.286 --> 01:27.087
YOU CAN'T STOP COUGHING,

01:27.087 --> 01:28.419
THE SWELLING WON'T GO DOWN,

01:28.419 --> 01:31.222
THAT'S WHEN YOU TURN
TO A PROFESSIONAL.

01:31.222 --> 01:33.093
SO... (exhales)

01:33.093 --> 01:36.297
AS SURGEONS, WE SPEND YEARS
DEVELOPING SKILLS OF PERCEPTION

01:36.297 --> 01:39.430
THAT ALLOW US TO SEE EXACTLY
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

01:39.430 --> 01:41.432
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN LOOKED.

01:41.432 --> 01:44.375
AMY, I AM TELLING YOU,
IT IS UNRESCETABLE. LET IT GO.

01:44.375 --> 01:46.177
I CAME ALL THE WAY
FROM L.A. TO SHOW YOU THIS.

01:46.177 --> 01:48.108
YOU COULD SPEND
MORE THAN 30 SECONDS.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.310
I AM LOOKING RIGHT AT IT.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.242
IT'S A GLIOSARCOMA THAT HAS
INVADED THE CAROTID ARTERY.

01:51.242 --> 01:53.184
YOU TRY AND REMOVE IT,
SHE WILL STROKE OUT.

01:53.184 --> 01:54.315
STOP BEING A JACKASS.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.387
WOW.

01:56.387 --> 01:59.290
I'M--SHE CALLED--
SHE CALLED YOU A JACKASS.

01:59.290 --> 02:00.421
DR. GREY, EXCUSE US.

02:00.421 --> 02:03.194
DR. GREY, STAY HERE.
I NEED BACKUP.

02:03.194 --> 02:04.395
FINE.

02:04.395 --> 02:06.157
♪♪♪

02:06.157 --> 02:07.398
YOU JUST GOT OUT OF REHAB.

02:07.398 --> 02:09.430
I WANT YOU TO GET
ON YOUR FEET.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.432
BUT YOU CAN'T HELP HER.

02:11.432 --> 02:15.436
♪♪♪

02:15.436 --> 02:17.508
LOOK AT HIS FACE.

02:17.508 --> 02:19.340
HIS NAME IS MASON.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.142
THIS GLIOSARCOMA
BELONGS TO HIS MOTHER ERICA.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.245
HE'S A GREAT KID.
I DON'T KNOW HIM THAT WELL,

02:24.245 --> 02:25.376
BUT HE SEEMS GREAT.

02:25.376 --> 02:27.178
I DO KNOW HIS DAD WELL.
HIS NAME IS COOPER,

02:27.178 --> 02:29.320
AND HE WORKS WITH ME
AND HE IS A GOOD GUY.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.223
HE IS A GOOD DAD,
WHICH MEANS HE IS THE ONE

02:32.223 --> 02:33.424
WHO IS GONNA HAVE TO TELL MASON
THAT HIS MOM IS DEAD,

02:33.424 --> 02:35.286
THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE
A MOM ANYMORE

02:35.286 --> 02:37.188
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

02:37.188 --> 02:39.260
YOU TELL COOPER YOU'RE SORRY.
YOU TRIED.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.461
LET IT GO.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.263
I HAVE A SURGERY.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.164
TROUBLE IS,

02:44.164 --> 02:45.536
SOMETIMES ALL THAT TIME SPENT

02:45.536 --> 02:48.299
DEVELOPING THOSE SKILLS
OF PERCEPTION

02:48.299 --> 02:49.440
CAN LEAVE A PERSON

02:49.440 --> 02:51.342
WITH AN EXTREMELY NARROW
POINT OF VIEW.

02:51.342 --> 02:52.543
AND HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO
ARGUE WITH SOMEONE

02:52.543 --> 02:54.475
WHO HAS SCIENCE ON THEIR SIDE?

02:54.475 --> 02:56.207
(clears throat) AH.

02:56.207 --> 02:58.279
65-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
ENTERS THE E.R. IN SHOCK.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.551
PRESENTS WITH A PULSATILE,
EXPANDING ABDOMINAL MASS.

03:00.551 --> 03:02.253
GO.

03:02.253 --> 03:03.384
RUPTURED TRIPLE-A.

03:03.384 --> 03:06.217
I WOULD TAKE THE PATIENT
STRAIGHT TO THE O.R.

03:06.217 --> 03:08.259
AND ACCESS
THE PERITONEAL CAVITY

03:08.259 --> 03:10.261
THROUGH A VERTICAL
MIDLINE INCISION.

03:10.261 --> 03:11.462
NICE.

03:11.462 --> 03:13.324
YOU GUYS STUDYING
FOR THE ORAL BOARDS

03:13.324 --> 03:14.525
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY?
JUST ANOTHER BENEFIT
OF HAVING A STUDY BUDDY.

03:14.525 --> 03:16.327
YOU SHOULD GET ONE.
I HAVE ONE.

03:16.327 --> 03:17.468
IT'S JUST THAT
MY STUPID STUDY BUDDY'S

03:17.468 --> 03:19.430
TOO BUSY TRYING TO SAVE
HER STUPID MARRIAGE

03:19.430 --> 03:21.332
TO ACTUALLY HELP ME STUDY.

03:21.332 --> 03:22.473
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT'S BETTER
THAN A STUDY BUDDY?

03:22.473 --> 03:24.405
A STUDY LACKEY. CHECK IT.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.206
HEY, YOU.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.409
BROWN-HAIRED GIRL,
YOU'RE UP.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.282
UH, TRAUMA INCIDENT
OR A SURGICAL SITUATION?

03:31.282 --> 03:32.513
YOU MADE YOUR INTERNS
COME UP WITH STUDY QUESTIONS?

03:32.513 --> 03:33.584
SURPRISE ME.

03:33.584 --> 03:35.416
A 12-YEAR-OLD BOY
FELL OFF HIS BIKE,

03:35.416 --> 03:36.487
HITTING HIS ABDOMEN
AGAINST THE HANDLEBARS.

03:36.487 --> 03:37.588
COMPLAINS OF PROGRESSIVE
ABDOMINAL PAIN

03:37.588 --> 03:39.250
AND IS SHORT OF BREATH.
(cell phone chimes)

03:39.250 --> 03:41.252
BREATH SOUNDS CLOUDY.
WHAT IS IT?

03:41.252 --> 03:43.223
SLOAN. 9-1-1.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.595
HEY, IF YOU WANT,
WE COULD--

03:44.595 --> 03:46.397
I DON'T NEED HELP.
I'M AN EXCELLENT SURGEON.

03:46.397 --> 03:48.359
YOU KNOW IT,
AND I KNOW IT.

03:48.359 --> 03:49.430
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.332
I DON'T HAVE TO PROVE MYSELF
TO ANYONE.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.604
YEAH, EXCEPT TO
THE AMERICAN BOARD OF SURGERY.

03:53.604 --> 03:55.235
YEAH, THERE'S THEM.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.307

MEREDITH GREY.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.582
NO.

04:11.582 --> 04:13.454
NOT GREY.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.255
YANG, MAYBE.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.428
YANG'S A COWBOY.

04:17.428 --> 04:19.330
KEPNER.

04:19.330 --> 04:20.361
KEPNER?

04:20.361 --> 04:22.333
NOT KEPNER.

04:22.333 --> 04:23.634
DEFINITELY NOT GREY.

04:23.634 --> 04:25.336
SHE SPENT ALL THAT TIME
IN NEURO,

04:25.336 --> 04:26.397
AND SUDDENLY,
SHE'S CHASING GENERAL.

04:26.397 --> 04:27.538
SHE'S UNFOCUSED.

04:27.538 --> 04:29.470
YOU'RE UNDERESTIMATING HER.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.572
I THINK SHE'D SURPRISE YOU.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.544
(chuckles)
SHE'D HAVE TO.

04:33.544 --> 04:35.406
SHE WILL.

04:37.408 --> 04:39.510
SHE'LL HAVE TO COME TO ME.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.394
I'D DO
AN EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.525
YOU SAID THAT ALREADY.

04:54.525 --> 04:56.567
I KNOW. UM... (sighs)

04:56.567 --> 04:57.628
THE PATIENT'S STILL CRASHING?

04:57.628 --> 04:59.370
YEP.

04:59.370 --> 05:01.432
OH! I GOTTA CRACK OPEN
HIS CHEST.

05:01.432 --> 05:02.633
YOU'VE GOTTA WHAT?

05:02.633 --> 05:04.475
UH, RELAX. N-NOT YOU.

05:04.475 --> 05:05.576
GOOD MORNING,
CHUCK.

05:05.576 --> 05:07.307
HEY, KAREV.
AND, DR. PETERSON,

05:07.307 --> 05:08.509
IT'S ALWAYS NICE
TO SEE YOU IN PEDS.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.310
THANK YOU, DR. ROBBINS.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.412
UH, SO, UH, CHUCK'S
LOOKING PRETTY GOOD.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.483
OH.

05:12.483 --> 05:13.684
UM, HIS, UH,
ABDOMINAL PAIN'S DECREASED,

05:13.684 --> 05:16.617
AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD TIME
TO SCHEDULE A GASTROSCOPY.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.589
GREAT, GREAT. WELL, THEN,
YOU'RE IN LUCK, DR. PETERSON,

05:18.589 --> 05:21.552
BECAUSE I THINK THAT KAREV
WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT SUPERVISOR

05:21.552 --> 05:23.524
FOR YOUR FIRST GASTROSCOPY.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.695
THANK YOU.

05:24.695 --> 05:27.628
OKAY, UH, MEGAN. LET'S GO
SCHEDULE THAT GASTROSCOPY.

05:27.628 --> 05:28.659
UH, IT--IT'S MORGAN.

05:28.659 --> 05:30.330
WHAT IS?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.402
MY NAME. IT'S MORGAN.

05:31.402 --> 05:33.404
WHATEVER. SAME DIFFERENCE.

05:33.404 --> 05:35.506
CARRIE RISSLER IS MY PATIENT.

05:35.506 --> 05:37.408
HAS BEEN FOR EIGHT YEARS.

05:37.408 --> 05:38.569
I'M AWARE.

05:38.569 --> 05:40.371
SHE WAS GIVEN
SIX MONTHS TO LIVE,

05:40.371 --> 05:42.373
BUT AFTER A MASTECTOMY,
OOPHORECTOMY,

05:42.373 --> 05:45.516
AND RISKY EXPERIMENTAL
BIOLOGICAL THERAPY,

05:45.516 --> 05:47.418
I MANAGED
TO SAVE HER LIFE.

05:47.418 --> 05:48.419
WHICH IS AWESOME.

05:48.419 --> 05:49.620
D--NO, IT IS NOT AWESOME.

05:49.620 --> 05:51.351
IT IS A MIRACLE.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.454
AND WHEN I SAW
ON THE O.R. BOARD

05:53.454 --> 05:55.456
THAT MY PATIENT--
MY MIRACLE--

05:55.456 --> 05:58.429
IS UNDERGOING
A LYMPH NODE TRANSFER

05:58.429 --> 05:59.560
WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE--

05:59.560 --> 06:00.691
SHE CAME TO US, DR. BAILEY.

06:00.691 --> 06:02.433
SAID SHE BROUGHT IT TO YOU
A FEW MONTHS AGO,

06:02.433 --> 06:03.594
AND YOU SHOT IT DOWN.

06:03.594 --> 06:06.667
'CAUSE HER EXTENSIVE SCARRING
MAKES HER A POOR CANDIDATE.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.469
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.501
BUT THEN AVERY SUGGESTED WE DO
SOME ANGIO STUDIES ON HER ARM--

06:10.501 --> 06:11.642
AVERY SUGGESTED?

06:11.642 --> 06:13.644
DR. BAILEY, THIS PROCEDURE
HAS HAD OUTSTANDING RESULTS

06:13.644 --> 06:16.647
FOR PATIENTS WITH--WITH VESSELS
JUST LIKE MRS. RISSLER'S, OKAY?

06:16.647 --> 06:18.609
THIS--
THIS COULD MAKE IT WORSE.

06:18.609 --> 06:19.710
IT--IT--IT COULD
EVEN KILL HER.

06:19.710 --> 06:21.412
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

06:21.412 --> 06:22.683
WELL, Y-YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT'S NOT,

06:22.683 --> 06:26.717
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT OPERATING,
NOT AFTER I SPEAK TO MY PATIENT.

06:26.717 --> 06:29.389
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

06:29.389 --> 06:31.462
YOU PAGED ME 9-1-1
TO GET YELLED AT?

06:31.462 --> 06:33.464
NO, I PAGED YOU 9-1-1
SO THAT YOU COULD HELP ME

06:33.464 --> 06:35.466
CONVINCE BAILEY WE'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING HERE.

06:35.466 --> 06:36.697
YOU FAILED.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.599
OKAY.
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

06:38.599 --> 06:40.601
WELL, LET'S HOPE CARRIE'S
A LITTLE BIT MORE PERSUASIVE

06:40.601 --> 06:42.603
THAN YOU ARE.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.735
(people speaking indistinctly)

06:44.735 --> 06:46.477
DR. TORRES,
DR. WEBBER SUGGESTED--

06:46.477 --> 06:47.608
UNH-UNH, HERE'S HOW
THIS IS GONNA WORK--

06:47.608 --> 06:48.739
I TALK, AND YOU LISTEN.

06:48.739 --> 06:50.481
YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU
AND YOUR LITTLE PALS

06:50.481 --> 06:51.612
ARE ALL FREAKED OUT
ABOUT THE ORAL BOARDS,

06:51.612 --> 06:53.544
AND DR. WEBBER SUGGESTED
THAT CALLIE TORRES

06:53.544 --> 06:56.617
MIGHT HAVE A SPECIAL
SECRET STUDY METHOD, RIGHT?

06:56.617 --> 06:58.489
MM-HMM.
YEAH, DR. WEBBER'S CORRECT.

06:58.489 --> 06:59.690
CALLIE TORRES DOES HAVE
A STUDY METHOD,

06:59.690 --> 07:01.452
AN EXCELLENT STUDY METHOD,

07:01.452 --> 07:02.723
BUT SHE'S NOT ABOUT
TO JUST GIVE IT AWAY.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.755
CALLIE TORRES' STUDY METHOD
HAS TO BE EARNED.

07:04.755 --> 07:06.557
FRANKLY, SHE DOESN'T THINK
THAT MEREDITH GREY

07:06.557 --> 07:08.629
HAS WHAT IT TAKES.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.501
I THINK SHE DOES?

07:10.501 --> 07:12.503
I THINK MEREDITH GREY
HAS WHAT IT TAKES?

07:12.503 --> 07:14.605
HIS B.P. WAS LOW
AND HIS VESSELS ARE COLLAPSED.

07:14.605 --> 07:16.436
WE COULD ONLY GET
ONE GOOD I.V. IN.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.668
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET
ANOTHER ONE.

07:17.668 --> 07:19.610
FOR HER SAKE, MEREDITH GREY
BETTER HOPE SHE'S RIGHT,

07:19.610 --> 07:20.671
'CAUSE TODAY,

07:20.671 --> 07:23.443
TODAY IS GONNA BE A GRIND.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.775
EXCUSE ME. COMING THROUGH.

07:24.775 --> 07:26.677
EXCUSE ME.

07:26.677 --> 07:27.748
(indistinct conversations)

07:27.748 --> 07:30.521
(moans)

07:30.521 --> 07:31.752
A GRIND? REALLY?

07:31.752 --> 07:33.484
IT'S A MEAT GRINDER.

07:33.484 --> 07:35.526
OH, WHATEVER. LIKE YOU
WEREN'T THINKING IT, TOO.

07:35.526 --> 07:36.657
(moans)

07:36.657 --> 07:47.467
(indistinct conversations
continue)

07:52.603 --> 07:54.675
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

07:54.675 --> 07:56.146
(groans)

07:56.146 --> 07:57.508
HANG IN THERE, DOM.

07:57.508 --> 07:59.109
YEAH, YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD,
BRO, REAL GOOD.

07:59.109 --> 08:00.250
YOU'RE LYING, TOMMY.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.582
I LOOK LIKE SOPRESSATA.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.514
DON'T WORRY, DOMINIC.
WE JUST GAVE YOU SOME DRUGS

08:03.514 --> 08:04.655
FOR THE PAIN.
OKAY.

08:04.655 --> 08:06.256
YOU'RE GONNA START
TO FEEL BETTER REAL QUICK.

08:06.256 --> 08:07.558
(moans)

08:07.558 --> 08:09.690
WHAT DO YOU THINK, DR. TORRES?
IS THIS AN AMPUTATION?

08:09.690 --> 08:11.662
(moans)
I-I DON'T KNOW. IS IT?

08:11.662 --> 08:13.123
TOMMY.
WHAT?

08:13.123 --> 08:14.194
NO, YOU TELL ME, DR. GREY.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.597
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE
AN AMPUTATION TO YOU?

08:16.597 --> 08:18.629
I MEAN, YEAH.

08:18.629 --> 08:20.200
(Dominic) AMPUTATE?

08:20.200 --> 08:21.702
NO, YOU CAN'T. I NEED MY HAND.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.534
TOMMY, DON'T LET THEM
TAKE MY...

08:23.534 --> 08:25.205
ALL RIGHT.
(sighs)

08:25.205 --> 08:26.677
WHOA. IS HE--
NO, THOSE ARE THE DRUGS.

08:26.677 --> 08:28.278
THEY WORK QUICKLY,
JUST LIKE WE HAVE TO.

08:28.278 --> 08:29.640
BUT YOU'RE JUST GONNA CUT OFF
HIS ARM? I MEAN, I--

08:29.640 --> 08:31.281
NO, THIS IS A TEACHING HOSPITAL,
MIKE, OKAY?

08:31.281 --> 08:32.613
(lowered voice)
I'M DOING A THING.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.184
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

08:34.184 --> 08:35.285
(normal voice) GREY,
HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA WORK

08:35.285 --> 08:36.687
IF YOU WANT MY HELP
ON THE BOARDS.

08:36.687 --> 08:38.188
YOU'RE GONNA RUN THIS.

08:38.188 --> 08:39.550
YOU'RE GONNA DECIDE
OUR COURSE OF ACTION.

08:39.550 --> 08:40.691
YOU'RE GONNA BE THE PERSON
THAT STANDS BETWEEN DOMINIC

08:40.691 --> 08:42.693
AND A HOOK FOR A HAND.

08:42.693 --> 08:44.224
YOU IN OR YOU OUT?

08:44.224 --> 08:45.626
I ALREADY SAID AMPUTATION
IS OUR BEST OPTION.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.558
OH. BEST?

08:47.558 --> 08:49.630
YEAH, BEST.
OKAY, SO BOOK AN O.R.
AND FIRE UP THE BONE SAW.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.702
LET'S MOVE HIM OUT, PEOPLE.
GREY WANTS TO AMPUTATE.
WHOA.

08:51.702 --> 08:53.163
(Mike and Tommy
speak indistinctly)
YEAH.

08:53.163 --> 08:55.265
DR. TORRES, WAIT.

08:55.265 --> 08:56.536
I HAVE A FINGER HERE.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.708
I KNEW THAT ALREADY,
DR. GREY.

08:57.708 --> 09:00.540
NO, A VIABLE FINGER.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.542
LOOK AT THE CAP REFILL.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.675
I-IS THAT BAD OR GOOD?

09:04.675 --> 09:06.617
DR. GREY,
IS THAT BAD OR GOOD?

09:06.617 --> 09:07.748
THAT'S GOOD.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.580
ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO?

09:09.580 --> 09:10.651
I THINK WE SHOULD
TAKE THIS THING OFF

09:10.651 --> 09:11.752
AND SEE WHAT'S LEFT.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.223
ALL RIGHT. TIME'S A FACTOR
HERE, GREY.

09:13.223 --> 09:14.284
WHY IS TIME A FACTOR?

09:14.284 --> 09:15.555
BECAUSE THE LONGER HIS HAND
STAYS IN THERE,

09:15.555 --> 09:17.227
THE MORE WE COMPROMISE
HIS CIRCULATION.

09:17.227 --> 09:18.558
TICK TOCK, DR. GREY.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.290
SO LET'S CALL UP TO MAINTENANCE
AND GET A SAWZALL.

09:20.290 --> 09:21.632
MM. YOU REALLY WANT
TO WAIT THAT LONG?

09:21.632 --> 09:23.664
UH, FIRE AND RESCUE
HAS TOOLS.
BETTER.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.265
OKAY.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.598
HEY, TH-THESE TOOLS,
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO,

09:27.598 --> 09:28.739
RIP APART THE GRINDER?

09:28.739 --> 09:30.340
TO SAVE HIS HAND.

09:30.340 --> 09:32.202
YEAH, WE DROPPED
A COUPLE GRAND ON THAT THING.

09:32.202 --> 09:33.604
YOU CAN'T TRASH IT.

09:33.604 --> 09:35.606
TO SAVE HIS HAND?

09:35.606 --> 09:38.348
MIKE, HOW LONG IS IT GONNA TAKE
YOU TO GET THAT THING APART?

09:38.348 --> 09:39.710
I-I TAKE IT APART
AND--AND CLEAN IT EVERY NIGHT.

09:39.710 --> 09:41.281
WE CAN GET HIM OUT.
YEAH.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.352
QUICK.
DR. TORRES?

09:42.352 --> 09:44.655
CAN YOU DO IT IN UNDER
45 MINUTES?

09:44.655 --> 09:47.217
GIVE OR TAKE?

09:47.217 --> 09:48.759
GREY?
DR. GREY WHAT?

09:48.759 --> 09:50.621
DO I THINK IT'S OKAY
TO LET A COUPLE OF CIVILIANS

09:50.621 --> 09:52.763
TAKE APART THE MACHINE THAT'S
GRINDING THEIR BROTHER'S HAND?

09:52.763 --> 09:54.725
YEAH.

09:54.725 --> 09:56.667
(sighs)

09:56.667 --> 09:57.798
LET'S DO IT.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.700
OKAY. I'M GONNA NEED
A SET OF ALLEN WRENCHES

09:59.700 --> 10:00.771
AND A PHILLIPS HEAD
SCREWDRIVER.

10:00.771 --> 10:02.633
MAKE THAT TWO.

10:02.633 --> 10:04.334
STAT!

10:04.334 --> 10:05.375
HANG IN THERE, DOM.

10:05.375 --> 10:06.807
(Mike speaks indistinctly)

10:06.807 --> 10:10.240
(both speak indistinctly)

10:10.240 --> 10:12.282
HEY, YOU PAGED?

10:12.282 --> 10:14.344
LOOK,
I CAN REMOVE THE TUMOR

10:14.344 --> 10:16.616
AND THE DISEASED CAROTID
TOGETHER.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.248
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS RUN
BALLOON CATHETERS

10:18.248 --> 10:20.721
IN THROUGH THE FEMORAL,
PLACE THEM IN PRECISE POSITION,

10:20.721 --> 10:22.322
INFLATE THEM
TO STOP THE BLOOD FLOW,

10:22.322 --> 10:23.724
DO TWO ARTERIOTOMIES,

10:23.724 --> 10:25.395
THEN FEED A HEPARINIZED SHUNT
INTO PLACE,

10:25.395 --> 10:27.257
AND REESTABLISH BLOOD FLOW.

10:27.257 --> 10:28.659
THAT'S ALL?

10:28.659 --> 10:31.261
OH, AND I HAVE TO DO IT
IN 90 SECONDS.

10:31.261 --> 10:33.333
ANY MORE THAN THAT,
AND SHE STROKES OUT.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.765
IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

10:34.765 --> 10:37.407
NOT SURE. I WOULD LOVE
TO TEST IT OUT.

10:37.407 --> 10:38.769
WE SHOULD SET UP
A SIMULATOR.

10:38.769 --> 10:41.411
UH, DON'T WE NEED
TO GET DEREK'S APPROVAL?

10:41.411 --> 10:43.273
YEAH, BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE
A BIG PROBLEM--

10:43.273 --> 10:44.414
HE LOVES TO SAY NO TO ME.

10:44.414 --> 10:46.346
THAT IS HIS FAVORITE THING
TO DO.

10:46.346 --> 10:49.319
MAYBE YOU SHOULD REFRAIN FROM
CALLING HIM A JACKASS.

10:49.319 --> 10:51.822
I CAN'T HELP IT, 'CAUSE HE
IS ONE. (clicks tongue)

10:51.822 --> 10:54.354
(sucks teeth)
MAYBE I SHOULD ASK HIM.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.286
WOULD YOU?
YEAH.

10:56.286 --> 10:58.328
HE'S IN SURGERY,
O.R. TWO.

11:01.391 --> 11:02.793
YOU JUST CALLED ME DOWN HERE

11:02.793 --> 11:04.735
SO THAT I WOULD GO
TO DEREK FOR YOU,

11:04.735 --> 11:06.797
MADE ME FEEL LIKE
IT WAS MY IDEA.

11:06.797 --> 11:08.298
AREN'T I GOOD?

11:08.298 --> 11:09.299
(elevator bell dings)

11:09.299 --> 11:11.341
AMAZING.

11:13.844 --> 11:15.375
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR--

11:15.375 --> 11:16.446
YOU HAVE NOT ALWAYS
BEEN CLEAR.

11:16.446 --> 11:17.708
SHE LOVES TO SAY THAT.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.379
ALWAYS BEEN CLEAR--
I DO NOT WANT KIDS.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.781
HE KNEW THAT.
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

11:20.781 --> 11:21.852
YOU KNEW THAT.

11:21.852 --> 11:23.313
I DID NOT KNOW THAT
IN THE BEGINNING.

11:23.313 --> 11:24.384
WHAT,
I HAVE AN ICICLE IN ME,

11:24.384 --> 11:25.716
AND I'M SUPPOSED
TO TELL A STRANGER,

11:25.716 --> 11:26.887
"HEY, I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE KIDS"?

11:26.887 --> 11:28.388
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
THE ICICLE.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.420
I AM TALKING ABOUT AFTER.

11:30.420 --> 11:31.822
(mutters)
AFTER.

11:31.822 --> 11:34.825
NO, I TOLD YOU WHEN IT WAS
RELEVANT TO THE RELATIONSHIP.

11:34.825 --> 11:36.326
MOST PEOPLE WOULD'VE CONSIDERED
DROPPING A BOMB LIKE THAT

11:36.326 --> 11:37.397
BEFORE THE WEDDING.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.429
THAT IS WHEN
IT WOULD'VE BEEN RELEVANT.

11:39.429 --> 11:40.801
WELL, UH, YOU PROPOSED,
AND WE WERE MARRIED

11:40.801 --> 11:42.402
LIKE 12 HOURS LATER.

11:42.402 --> 11:46.706
SO SUE ME IF, IN THE MOMENT,
I WAS THINKING OF OTHER THINGS.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.439
(clock ticking)

11:49.439 --> 11:52.442
I-I KNOW THE LYMPHEDEMA
IS BAD.

11:52.442 --> 11:53.744
OH, IT'S MISERABLE.

11:53.744 --> 11:56.416
THESE ARE SAUSAGES,
NOT ARMS.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.749
I CAN'T LIFT THEM. OH.

11:58.749 --> 12:00.420
I'M IN PAIN ALL THE TIME.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.853
I THINK... (sighs)

12:02.853 --> 12:06.496
LOOK, WE JUST NEED TO BE HAPPY
THE CANCER IS GONE

12:06.496 --> 12:09.459
AND LOOK
AT THE LYMPHEDEMA AS...

12:09.459 --> 12:11.802
UH, THE--THE PRICE
WE'RE PAYING--

12:11.802 --> 12:13.764
THE PRICE I'M PAYING.

12:13.764 --> 12:16.406
OH, LOOK...

12:16.406 --> 12:17.938
YOU DON'T THINK I FELT AWFUL,

12:17.938 --> 12:21.511
SNEAKING IN HERE LIKE A THIEF
TO GET MY SURGERY?

12:21.511 --> 12:23.774
BUT I'M JUST...

12:23.774 --> 12:24.845
(sighs)

12:24.845 --> 12:26.917
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.450
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT YOU.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.382
YOU'RE A HERO TO ME.

12:32.382 --> 12:34.524
BUT I...

12:34.524 --> 12:37.788
I WANT TO BE ABLE
TO BRUSH MY HAIR...

12:37.788 --> 12:39.790
HOLD MY GRANDSON.

12:39.790 --> 12:41.862
ERIN HAD A BABY?

12:41.862 --> 12:43.533
HAVING ONE,
IN THE SPRING. (laughs)

12:43.533 --> 12:46.436
OH, E--OH, MY--
SHE WAS JUST STARTING COLLEGE

12:46.436 --> 12:48.398
WHEN YOU WERE
FIRST DIAGNOSED.

12:48.398 --> 12:49.800
I KNOW.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.542
YOU PROMISED ME I'D MAKE IT
TO HER GRADUATION.

12:52.542 --> 12:54.404
(sighs)

12:55.775 --> 12:56.907
IF YOU...

12:56.907 --> 12:59.509
REALLY THINK
THIS IS A MISTAKE,

12:59.509 --> 13:01.812
I WON'T DO IT.

13:04.915 --> 13:06.456
O-OKAY. YOU GOT IT?
YOU GOT IT?

13:06.456 --> 13:07.517
I GOT IT.

13:07.517 --> 13:08.788
SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN, GREY?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.490
OKAY, MY PLAN IS,
THEY GET THIS THING OFF,

13:10.490 --> 13:11.822
AND THEN WE ASSESS.
(Tommy and Mike
speak indistinctly)

13:11.822 --> 13:12.893
RIGHT, BUT WHAT IF
THEY DON'T?

13:12.893 --> 13:13.964
YOU NEED AN ALTERNATE PLAN.

13:13.964 --> 13:15.495
WELL, I DON'T NEED
AN ALTERNATE PLAN,

13:15.495 --> 13:16.796
BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA
GET IT OFF.

13:16.796 --> 13:17.968
(monitor beeping erratically)

13:17.968 --> 13:19.569
WHAT'D YOU DO?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

13:19.569 --> 13:21.531
THE MORE YOU GUYS LOOSEN THAT,
THE MORE HE'S GONNA BLEED.

13:21.531 --> 13:22.572
(Mike) SHOULD WE STOP?

13:22.572 --> 13:23.834
NO, KEEP GOING,
JUST GO FASTER.

13:23.834 --> 13:25.005
Y-YOU SURE
YOU HAVE TIME FOR THAT?

13:25.005 --> 13:27.537
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SUGGEST, WHY DON'T YOU?

13:27.537 --> 13:29.809
NOW YOU'RE JUST
WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME.
WELL, WE HAVE TO GET HIM
UP TO THE O.R.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.512
OR HE'S GONNA BLEED OUT.
YEAH, WELL, HIS HAND'S STILL
TRAPPED IN THAT GRINDER.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.944
LET'S GET A PNEUMATIC TOURNIQUET
ON HIS ARM ABOVE THE GRINDER.

13:33.944 --> 13:35.585
THAT'LL BUY US A FEW MINUTES.

13:35.585 --> 13:36.987
OKAY.

13:36.987 --> 13:38.518
I CAN GIVE YOU GUYS
15 MINUTES,

13:38.518 --> 13:39.950
AND AFTER THAT,
I HAVE TO AMPUTATE.

13:39.950 --> 13:41.992
UNDERSTOOD.

13:41.992 --> 13:43.593
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

13:43.593 --> 13:45.595
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

13:45.595 --> 13:46.957
WE'VE OPERATED ON WORSE.

13:46.957 --> 13:49.559
LEXIE, SHE SHOWED US
A PICTURE OF A LITTLE BOY.

13:49.559 --> 13:53.864
I KNOW. I-IT'S CLEAR THAT
SHE IS PASSIONATE...

13:53.864 --> 13:55.465
MY SISTER IS TOO EMOTIONALLY
WRAPPED UP IN THIS PATIENT

13:55.465 --> 13:57.938
TO CLEARLY SEE THAT
SHE CAN'T HELP THIS WOMAN.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.569
YOU KNOW, IT TELLS ME THAT
SHE'S PASSIONATE ENOUGH

13:59.569 --> 14:00.941
TO TRY HARDER.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.542
YEAH, WELL,
ALL THE PASSION IN THE WORLD

14:02.542 --> 14:03.974
IS NOT GONNA MAKE
HER PLAN DOABLE IN 90 SECONDS.

14:03.974 --> 14:05.545
YOU NEED TO SEE THAT
FOR YOURSELF,

14:05.545 --> 14:06.947
FINE, SET IT UP.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.549
ONLY YOU'RE GONNA BE
THE ONE WHO SEES A THING.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.521
I MEAN, THANK YOU.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.024
(door opens)

14:14.024 --> 14:15.485
(sighs)

14:17.057 --> 14:18.889
DR. ROBBINS SAID
I WOULD BE DOING THIS.

14:18.889 --> 14:20.490
YEAH, HOW CAN YOU DO
A GASTROSCOPY

14:20.490 --> 14:21.992
AND READ THE INDEX CARDS?

14:21.992 --> 14:23.964
COME ON.
KEEP 'EM COMING.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.865
CONGENITAL AGANGLIONIC
MEGACOLON, ALSO KNOWN AS...

14:25.865 --> 14:26.937
HIRSCHSPRUNG'S DISEASE.

14:26.937 --> 14:28.038
TYPICAL TREATMENT?

14:28.038 --> 14:31.571
A PULL-THROUGH PROCEDURE.
DID YOU SKIP SYMPTOMS?

14:31.571 --> 14:33.573
UH, SYMPTOMS, RIGHT.
SORRY.

14:33.573 --> 14:34.905
DON'T CRAP OUT
ON ME NOW, MEGAN.

14:34.905 --> 14:35.976
MORGAN.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.507
UH, SYMPTOMS, UH,

14:37.507 --> 14:39.879
SEVERE AND PERSISTENT
TIGHTNESS IN CHEST,

14:39.879 --> 14:42.052
INDIGESTION, BLURRED VISION,
SHORTNESS OF BREATH...

14:42.052 --> 14:43.653
YEAH,
THAT'S NOT HIRSCHSPRUNG'S.

14:43.653 --> 14:45.055
SEVERE HEADACHE, NAUSEA.

14:45.055 --> 14:47.587
PATIENT IS 24 WEEKS PREGNANT.

14:47.587 --> 14:48.658
YEAH?
WELL, THAT NARROWS IT DOWN.

14:48.658 --> 14:49.990
UH... (blows air)
IT COULD BE P.I.H.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.922
YEAH, I'D ORDER LABS
AND, UH, A U.A.

14:51.922 --> 14:53.523
THEN I'D TAKE HER DOWN
TO THE O.B.

14:53.523 --> 14:54.664
SO SHE COULD BE MONITORED.

14:54.664 --> 14:56.066
OKAY. YEAH. Y-YEAH.

14:56.066 --> 14:59.669
YOU SHOULD--YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY DO THAT.

14:59.669 --> 15:01.601
HEY. HEY. HEY!

15:01.601 --> 15:02.933
HEY.

15:02.933 --> 15:04.574
ARE YOU GONNA JUST STAND THERE
OR ARE YOU GONNA HELP HER?

15:04.574 --> 15:05.675
(woman) MORGAN?

15:10.640 --> 15:12.412
WHEN WERE YOU GONNA TELL ME
YOU WERE PREGNANT?

15:12.412 --> 15:13.913
EVERYBODY IN THIS HOSPITAL
KNOWS THAT I'M PREGNANT.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.916
BUT THEN THEY--
THEY ALSO KNOW MY NAME.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.518
WELL, THERE'S A GOOD
FETAL HEART RATE.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.590
THE BABY LOOKS FINE.

15:20.590 --> 15:21.992
THESE ARE DEFINITELY
NOT CONTRACTIONS.

15:21.992 --> 15:23.523
LIST THE SYMPTOMS.

15:23.523 --> 15:24.995
I AM NOT QUIZZING YOU
RIGHT NOW.

15:24.995 --> 15:27.427
NO, YOUR SYMPTOMS.
CHEST TIGHTNESS...

15:27.427 --> 15:29.429
NAUSEA,
SHORTNESS OF BREATH,

15:29.429 --> 15:31.531
INDIGESTION.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.533
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

15:33.533 --> 15:35.565
YOU MEAN LIKE,
UH, HEARTBURN?

15:35.565 --> 15:37.567
MM-HMM.
PAGE CARDIO.

15:37.567 --> 15:38.708
YOU'RE HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

15:38.708 --> 15:40.710
(breathes deeply)

15:40.710 --> 15:42.942
THERE IS NO DEEPER REASON.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.544
THERE HAS TO BE.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.476
THERE IS NO DEEPER REASON.

15:46.476 --> 15:47.577
I WASN'T ABUSED.

15:47.577 --> 15:49.949
I-I DON'T HAVE A DARK SECRET.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.521
I WASN'T MUGGED BY A BABY.

15:51.521 --> 15:52.722
I JUST DON'T WANT KIDS.

15:52.722 --> 15:55.485
NOBODY DOESN'T WANT KIDS.

15:55.485 --> 15:57.657
PEOPLE CAN NOT WANT KIDS.
IT'S A THING.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.729
THAT IS NOT A THING.

15:59.729 --> 16:01.731
WELL, IT'S MY THING.

16:01.731 --> 16:03.463
(clock ticking)

16:03.463 --> 16:04.734
(sighs)

16:04.734 --> 16:08.598
(ticking continues)

16:08.598 --> 16:10.670
YOU'RE GONNA
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.743
YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE YOUR MIND
IN THREE YEARS OR FIVE.

16:13.743 --> 16:15.975
YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE
YOUR MIND ABOUT HAVING A BABY,

16:15.975 --> 16:17.607
AND THEN IT'S GONNA BE
TOO LATE.

16:17.607 --> 16:19.549
AND YOU'RE GONNA REGRET IT.

16:19.549 --> 16:21.651
AND I WILL KNOW
AND UNDERSTAND

16:21.651 --> 16:24.554
THAT I MADE A CHOICE.

16:24.554 --> 16:26.556
I CHOOSE MEDICINE.

16:26.556 --> 16:27.757
I CHOOSE ME.

16:27.757 --> 16:29.659
I CHOOSE THAT OVER
THE REMOTE POSSIBILITY

16:29.659 --> 16:32.022
THAT I MIGHT ONE DAY REGRET

16:32.022 --> 16:33.993
NOT HAVING A CHILD.

16:35.525 --> 16:36.666
AND BY THE WAY,

16:36.666 --> 16:38.068
IT'S ALL RIGHT
TO NEVER WANT KIDS.

16:38.068 --> 16:39.999
SOME PEOPLE
DON'T EVER WANT KIDS.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.731
WELL, I WANT TO KNOW WHY.

16:41.731 --> 16:43.573
WHY?

16:43.573 --> 16:45.075
(ticking continues)

16:45.075 --> 16:48.708
(indistinct conversations)

16:48.708 --> 16:50.510
IN 2004,

16:50.510 --> 16:51.741
I WAS REMOVING METS

16:51.741 --> 16:53.643
FROM CARRIE RISSLER'S
ABDOMEN AND PELVIS,

16:53.643 --> 16:55.615
AND DECIDED TO GO FOR ONE
NEAR HER LIVER

16:55.615 --> 16:56.746
WHEN SHE STARTED
BLEEDING OUT.

16:56.746 --> 16:58.088
AS I WAS TRYING
TO STOP THE BLEEDING,

16:58.088 --> 16:59.719
SHE WENT INTO HEART FAILURE.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.591
I HAD TO SEND HER
TO THE I.C.U.,

17:01.591 --> 17:03.593
TELL HER DAUGHTER ERIN
THAT SHE WAS IN A COMA

17:03.593 --> 17:05.625
AND THAT THERE WAS A GOOD CHANCE
SHE WOULDN'T WAKE UP.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.026
BUT SHE DID.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.728
AND SHE STILL HAD TWO MORE
SURGERIES AHEAD OF HER

17:08.728 --> 17:10.700
AND CHEMO
AND RADIATION.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.062
HER BODY IS A BATTLEFIELD--

17:12.062 --> 17:14.634
I GET IT.
YOU TALKED HER OUT OF IT.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.806
(pants) NO.

17:16.806 --> 17:19.569
YOU'RE DOING
THE LYMPH NODE TRANSFER,

17:19.569 --> 17:23.613
BUT NOT WITHOUT READING
EVERY PAGE OF THIS FILE TWICE.

17:23.613 --> 17:25.075
BUT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO OPERATE
IN HALF AN HOUR.

17:25.075 --> 17:26.676
THEN START READING.

17:26.676 --> 17:27.747
OKAY.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.679
(indistinct conversations
continue)

17:29.679 --> 17:32.822
I'M WATCHING YOU, AVERY.

17:32.822 --> 17:35.085
YES, MA'AM.

17:35.085 --> 17:38.088
(indistinct conversations
continue)

17:39.659 --> 17:41.091
COME ON.
I ALMOST GOT IT.

17:41.091 --> 17:42.762
COME ON. COME ON.
B.P.'s DROPPING, GREY.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.835
YOU GUYS
NEED TO BE DONE NOW.

17:45.835 --> 17:47.697
JUST ONE SECOND,
DR. GREY.

17:47.697 --> 17:49.139
JUST ONE--ONE MORE--

17:49.139 --> 17:50.700
AND DONE.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.702
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN BACK
THE AUGER AND PULL HIM OUT.

17:52.702 --> 17:54.774
NO, WE'LL PULL HIM OUT.
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.746
GREY, TAKE THIS.
YOU'VE GOT THE AUGER.
OKAY.

17:56.746 --> 17:58.778
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

17:58.778 --> 18:01.751
(squeaking)

18:01.751 --> 18:03.613
LOOK, CAN'T WE JUST STICK
AROUND AND SEE--

18:03.613 --> 18:05.815
THERE WE GO.

18:05.815 --> 18:08.087
OH, HOLY GOD.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.689
(sputters)

18:09.689 --> 18:11.161
(thuds)

18:11.161 --> 18:12.762
(indistinct conversations)

18:12.762 --> 18:13.863
(thud)

18:13.863 --> 18:16.726
OKAY, SO... WE'VE GOT
A PIECE OF HAND

18:16.726 --> 18:18.128
WITH SORT OF FINGERS
ON IT.

18:18.128 --> 18:20.170
(squishes)

18:20.170 --> 18:22.802
WHAT ABOUT THESE?
CAN THESE BE SAVED?

18:22.802 --> 18:24.774
I DON'T KNOW. CAN THEY?

18:24.774 --> 18:26.706
(indistinct conversations
continue)

18:31.611 --> 18:32.612
BOOM!

18:32.612 --> 18:33.683
(beeps)

18:33.683 --> 18:34.744
97 SECONDS.

18:34.744 --> 18:36.846
(sighs) BITE ME!

18:36.846 --> 18:39.118
WOW.
SORRY.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.690
JUST...

18:40.690 --> 18:42.622
SORRY. I JUST...

18:42.622 --> 18:45.825
I'VE BEEN AT 97 SECONDS
FOR 8 FREAKIN' TRIES NOW.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.797
MAYBE NOT THE NINTH.

18:47.797 --> 18:48.858
(sighs)

18:48.858 --> 18:50.660
IF I CAN FIND
ANOTHER STOPWATCH.

18:50.660 --> 18:51.801
I MEAN,
DEREK'S PROBABLY RIGHT.

18:51.801 --> 18:54.664
I'M JUST--
I'M GONNA LET HER DOWN.

18:54.664 --> 18:56.736
HE SHOULD KNOW. I'VE LET HIM
DOWN ENOUGH TIMES.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.170
LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

19:00.170 --> 19:02.712
LET'S GO, UH, YOU WANT
TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT?

19:05.745 --> 19:08.678
I WANT SOMETHING.
(exhales)

19:08.678 --> 19:10.780
IT'S NOT FOOD.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.656
THERE'S A GUY WHO GOT HIS HAND
STUCK IN A MEAT GRINDER.

19:18.788 --> 19:19.929
I...

19:19.929 --> 19:21.861
WOULDN'T MIND SEEING THAT.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.733
YES.

19:23.733 --> 19:26.165
(monitor beeping erratically)

19:26.165 --> 19:28.198
OKAY, MORGAN,
YOU HAD AN ACUTE M.I.

19:28.198 --> 19:30.870
FROM A SPONTANEOUS
CORONARY ARTERY DISSECTION.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.773
ARE YOU KIDDING? I-I DON'T
HAVE ANY OF THE RISK FACTORS.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.805
YEAH, WELL, MOST LIKELY,
RELATED TO YOUR PREGNANCY.

19:35.805 --> 19:38.748
WE NEED TO GET YOU
UPSTAIRS RIGHT NOW.

19:38.748 --> 19:40.750
DR. ROBBINS,
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

19:40.750 --> 19:42.212
WE NEED TO REPAIR
THE DISSECTION IMMEDIATELY.

19:42.212 --> 19:43.883
MY BABY'S FINE, RIGHT?
YOU SAID THAT MY BABY WAS FINE?

19:43.883 --> 19:44.954
MORGAN, LISTEN TO ME--

19:44.954 --> 19:46.916
IF MY BABY'S FINE,
WHY ARE YOU HERE!

19:46.916 --> 19:48.187
LIE BACK, LIE BACK,
LISTEN TO ME.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.689
ALL RIGHT, WE NEED TO GO
RIGHT NOW.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.860
BUT IT'S TOO EARLY
TO TAKE THE BABY OUT.

19:50.860 --> 19:53.223
HE--HE--SHE COULD HAVE
R.D.S. OR GET SEPTIC?

19:53.223 --> 19:54.924
THE DISSECTION'S EXTENSIVE.

19:54.924 --> 19:57.767
WE HAVE TO PUT YOU ON BYPASS
IN ORDER TO FIX IT,

19:57.767 --> 19:58.898
SO THE BABY NEEDS
TO BE DELIVERED NOW.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.700
SHE BARELY HAS ANY LUNGS.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.971
24 WEEKS IS PREMATURE,
BUT THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE.

20:01.971 --> 20:03.833
NO, YOU--YOU CAN'T
SAY THAT, OKAY?

20:03.833 --> 20:05.835
I KNOW WHAT YOU CAN
AND CAN'T SAY IS VERY GOOD...

20:05.835 --> 20:07.707
(crying)
AND YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.

20:07.707 --> 20:08.908
LISTEN, MY BABY WAS BORN
AT 23 WEEKS,

20:08.908 --> 20:10.780
AND IT'S TERRIFYING, I KNOW,
BUT I'LL BE HERE FOR YOU.

20:10.780 --> 20:12.282
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE HERE.

20:12.282 --> 20:13.743
WILL SOMEONE CALL
MY BOYFRIEND?

20:13.743 --> 20:14.814
HIS NAME IS THE FIRST
IN MY PHONE.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.215
ALL RIGHT.
KAREV, CALL HER BOYFRIEND

20:16.215 --> 20:17.787
AND LET HIM KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.
I'M SCRUBBING IN.

20:17.787 --> 20:19.719
SHE'S YOUR INTERN, KAREV.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.920
(sighs) YEAH, OKAY.

20:20.920 --> 20:21.921

A LITTLE MORE SUCTION, AVERY?

22:42.962 --> 22:45.865
DR. BAILEY, WHILE I'M ALWAYS
GLAD TO HEAR YOUR PERSPECTIVE,

22:45.865 --> 22:47.066
I'LL INSTRUCT THE RESIDENT.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.998
BUT YOUR INSTRUCTIONS
RESULT IN OOPS.

22:48.998 --> 22:51.040
WE DON'T OOPS
IN MY O.R.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.842
(inhales)

22:52.842 --> 22:54.874
(exhales)

22:54.874 --> 22:56.946
LET'S TRY
A LITTLE MORE SUCTION.

22:56.946 --> 23:00.049
♪ OOH, OOH, OOH,
OOH, OOH, OOH ♪

23:00.049 --> 23:01.851
(Derek) WITH MR. HAMILTON'S
LAMINECTOMY,

23:01.851 --> 23:03.883
I WANT AN EPIDURAL DRAIN
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.785
YES, DOCTOR.

23:05.785 --> 23:06.986
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST
LISTEN TO HER.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.918
LOOK, I SWEAR, YOU GOTTA
STOP ENCOURAGING HER.

23:08.918 --> 23:10.720
WELL, THIS IS WHAT
YOU TAUGHT ME TO DO.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.722
YOU TAUGHT ME TO NOT GIVE UP
UNTIL WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.

23:12.722 --> 23:13.863
BECAUSE YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

23:13.863 --> 23:14.994
WHEN WE LOSE A PATIENT,

23:14.994 --> 23:16.996
I KNOW IF YOU'RE OKAY
OR YOU'RE NOT

23:16.996 --> 23:18.798
BECAUSE I'M RIGHT THERE
WITH YOU.

23:18.798 --> 23:19.969
WITH HER, I CANNOT DO THAT,

23:19.969 --> 23:21.931
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
SHE CAN HANDLE IT.

23:21.931 --> 23:23.803
NOT NOW.

23:23.803 --> 23:24.934
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO IS
TOO EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.

23:24.934 --> 23:27.076
OKAY, IF THIS TUMOR HAD COME
TO YOU FROM ANY OTHER DOCTOR,

23:27.076 --> 23:28.878
YOU WOULD STILL
BE LOOKING AT IT.

23:28.878 --> 23:30.079
YOU ARE SO WORRIED ABOUT
YOUR SISTER'S OUTCOME,

23:30.079 --> 23:32.882
YOU WON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
HER PATIENT'S.

23:32.882 --> 23:34.814
AM I WRONG?

23:34.814 --> 23:36.746
(exhales)

23:36.746 --> 23:38.047
(exhales)

23:38.047 --> 23:41.050
(clock ticking)

23:47.757 --> 23:49.899
YOU HAVE TO TRY.

23:49.899 --> 23:50.960
(ticking continues)

23:50.960 --> 23:53.833
I AM.
I'M--I'M TRYING.

23:53.833 --> 23:54.964
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FOCUS
ON EACH OTHER AND BREATHE,

23:54.964 --> 23:56.105
AND YOU'RE NOT.

23:56.105 --> 23:57.867
I MEAN, YOUR MIND
IS TOTALLY ELSEWHERE.

23:57.867 --> 23:59.869
OH, SO NOW YOU KNOW
MY EVERY THOUGHT AND INTENTION?

23:59.869 --> 24:02.872
(ticking continues)

24:04.013 --> 24:06.015
(sighs)

24:10.149 --> 24:14.053
WE USED TO BE ABLE
TO LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

24:14.053 --> 24:17.827
AND I'D FEEL...

24:17.827 --> 24:20.029
LIKE WE WERE GONNA BE OKAY.

24:20.029 --> 24:21.791
(ticking continues)

24:21.791 --> 24:23.793
(voice breaking) THERE IS
A REASON WE'RE TOGETHER, OWEN.

24:23.793 --> 24:25.895
THERE IS A REASON
WE'RE MARRIED.

24:25.895 --> 24:27.797
PLEASE.

24:27.797 --> 24:29.999
LOOK AT ME.

24:29.999 --> 24:33.002
(ticking continues)

24:34.804 --> 24:37.106
ALL RIGHT.
I'M LOOKING AT YOU.

24:37.106 --> 24:40.910
RIGHT NOW...

24:40.910 --> 24:43.913
I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU.

24:43.913 --> 24:46.115
(ticking continues)

24:46.115 --> 24:48.117
(sighs)

24:58.968 --> 25:01.070
(sniffles)

25:01.070 --> 25:02.932
HE HAS TO STOP HOLDING
A GRUDGE.

25:04.974 --> 25:07.106
HE HAS TO SEE ME
FOR WHO I AM.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.138
HE HAS TO TAKE HIS LITTLE LIST
OF ALL MY CRIMES

25:09.138 --> 25:11.881
AND RIP IT UP, OTHERWISE--
OTHERWISE WHAT?

25:11.881 --> 25:12.882
YOU KNOW, I-I DON'T KNOW.

25:12.882 --> 25:14.844
(ticking continues)

25:14.844 --> 25:16.986
HOW ABOUT YOU STOP THINKING
THAT YOU'RE THE SUN,

25:16.986 --> 25:19.048
AND THAT I REVOLVE
AROUND YOU,

25:19.048 --> 25:22.191
AND THAT BEING A CARDIO GOD,
MAYBE THAT ISN'T EVERYTHING,

25:22.191 --> 25:26.996
AND MAYBE WHAT I NEED IS WORTHY
OF SOME CONSIDERATION?

25:26.996 --> 25:30.229
AND WE'RE BACK
TO THE ABORTION?

25:30.229 --> 25:33.132
(ticking continues)

25:33.132 --> 25:34.233
YEAH.

25:34.233 --> 25:37.036
YEAH, WE ARE.

25:37.036 --> 25:41.140
(ticking continues)

25:41.140 --> 25:43.873
I'M READY FOR THE TRANSFER,
AVERY.

25:43.873 --> 25:44.974
DR. SLOAN.

25:44.974 --> 25:46.215
YES.

25:46.215 --> 25:48.878
YOU KNOW THAT THIS PATIENT HAS
A HISTORY OF MULTIPLE SURGERIES

25:48.878 --> 25:50.980
IN THAT AREA.
SHE SURE DOES.

25:50.980 --> 25:53.082
OKAY, THEN I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU THINK

25:53.082 --> 25:55.084
IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO CONTINUE
TO DISSECT RIGHT THERE.

25:55.084 --> 25:57.927
RESPECTFULLY, DR. BAILEY,
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY IMPORTANT

25:57.927 --> 26:00.930
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING
I DO EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

26:00.930 --> 26:03.062
UH, NO, RESPECTFULLY,
DR. SLOAN, I DISAGREE.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.064
I THINK
IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

26:05.064 --> 26:08.167
NOW IF YOU HAD READ THE FILE
LIKE YOU SAID YOU DID,

26:08.167 --> 26:12.001
YOU'D KNOW THAT SHE'D HAVE
MASSIVE SCAR TISSUE

26:12.001 --> 26:14.003
EXACTLY IN THE AREA
THAT YOU'RE DISSECTING,

26:14.003 --> 26:16.075
SO I THINK GOING FORWARD

26:16.075 --> 26:19.208
WITH THAT DISSECTION IS
A MONUMENTALLY STUPID COURSE--

26:19.208 --> 26:21.080
RESPECTFULLY,
DR. BAILEY,

26:21.080 --> 26:22.181
UH, THE BULK
OF THAT SCAR TISSUE

26:22.181 --> 26:23.282
IS GONNA BE FOUND
NEAR HER AXILLA.

26:23.282 --> 26:26.115
SO IF DR. SLOAN CONTINUES
DISSECTING RIGHT THERE,

26:26.115 --> 26:28.157
I REALLY DON'T THINK
THERE'LL BE A PROBLEM.

26:28.157 --> 26:29.919
AND I-I READ THAT

26:29.919 --> 26:31.120
IN--IN--IN THE FILE,

26:31.120 --> 26:32.261
THE FILE THAT YOU--
CARRIE'S FILE--

26:32.261 --> 26:35.294
THAT YOU GAVE ME TO READ, I...

26:35.294 --> 26:37.266
I DID...
I DID READ IT.

26:37.266 --> 26:41.000
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

26:41.000 --> 26:42.201
(monitor beeping erratically)

26:42.201 --> 26:44.073
DAMN IT.
OH, WE'VE GOT
A BIG BLEEDER HERE.

26:44.073 --> 26:45.975
IS THAT SUBCLAVIAN?

26:45.975 --> 26:48.037
RESPECTFULLY, DOCTORS,

26:48.037 --> 26:50.109
I TOLD YOU SO.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.215
OKAY, SO I THINK
IT'LL WORK.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.987
IF WE CUT DOWN THE MACERATED
PART OF THE FINGER,

26:57.987 --> 26:59.188
IT'LL BE SHORT, BUT IT'LL
STILL BE SALVAGEABLE.

26:59.188 --> 27:01.120
OKAY, BUT THIS THUMB,
I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND SAY

27:01.120 --> 27:02.922
THAT'S NOT SALVAGEABLE.

27:02.922 --> 27:03.993
YEAH, YOU'RE DONE HERE.

27:03.993 --> 27:05.194
HE'LL BE BETTER OFF
WITH A PROSTHETIC.

27:05.194 --> 27:06.956
NO.

27:06.956 --> 27:09.198
THE THUMB IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR 40% OF HAND FUNCTION.

27:09.198 --> 27:10.930
WITHOUT IT, WE'RE DONE.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.002
BUT THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING ELSE.

27:13.002 --> 27:15.264
I MEAN, I READ SOMETHING
ABOUT SURGEONS

27:15.264 --> 27:18.968
USING A MAN'S BIG TOE AS--
AS A REPLACEMENT FOR A THUMB.

27:18.968 --> 27:20.940
LET'S DO THAT. LET'S--
LET'S USE HIS BIG TOE.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.271
LISTEN, DR. FRANKENSTEIN,
THE BIG TOE,

27:22.271 --> 27:25.014
IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT,
YOU KNOW, FOR WALKING.

27:25.014 --> 27:26.075
(chuckles)

27:26.075 --> 27:27.246
AND HE CAN LEARN
TO REBALANCE.

27:27.246 --> 27:28.978
OR HE CAN KEEP HIS TOE
WHERE IT IS.

27:28.978 --> 27:30.980
THIS IS A GOOD FIX.
I KNOW IT IS.

27:30.980 --> 27:32.151
NO, IT'S NOT.

27:32.151 --> 27:35.084
DR. TORRES,
IT HAS TO BE.

27:35.084 --> 27:37.186
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:37.186 --> 27:39.929
THE BIG TOE IS NOT THE FIX.

27:39.929 --> 27:42.261
THAT IS WHY WE'RE GONNA USE
THE SECOND TOE.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.193
IT'LL PROVIDE
THE SAME BENEFITS,

27:44.193 --> 27:46.135
BUT REDUCE
POTENTIAL DISABILITY.

27:46.135 --> 27:47.196
REALLY?

27:47.196 --> 27:49.098
YEAH, BUT WE'RE NOT
DOING ANYTHING

27:49.098 --> 27:51.070
WITHOUT THE PATIENT'S CONSENT.

27:54.303 --> 27:58.107
(people speaking indistinctly)

27:58.107 --> 28:02.011
ALL RIGHT. TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

28:02.011 --> 28:05.014
UH...

28:05.014 --> 28:06.215
I'M GOING IN
THROUGH THE CAROTID

28:06.215 --> 28:09.018
WITH TWO CATHETERS,
UH, ONE IN THE PROXIMAL--

28:09.018 --> 28:11.090
A CAROTID STICK?
THAT'LL KILL HER EVEN FASTER.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.161
DAMN IT, DEREK--

28:12.161 --> 28:13.963
AMY, I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU CAN'T STOP

28:13.963 --> 28:15.224
AND REESTABLISH BLOOD FLOW
IN 90 SECONDS.

28:15.224 --> 28:18.027
I MEAN, I CAN'T DO IT
IN 90 SECONDS.

28:18.027 --> 28:20.169
OH, WELL, THE GREAT GOD
OF NEUROSURGERY HAS SPOKEN--

28:20.169 --> 28:22.171
LOOK, NOW I'M--I'M TRYING
TO HELP YOU.

28:22.171 --> 28:24.103
BUT PLEASE DON'T PUT YOURSELF
THROUGH THIS.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.304
YOU'RE TOO FRAGILE.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.336
I AM NOT FRAGILE.

28:27.336 --> 28:29.278
I'M A DRUG ADDICT.

28:29.278 --> 28:31.080
I'VE FALLEN
OFF THE WAGON TWICE,

28:31.080 --> 28:32.211
AND I'VE GOTTEN BACK ON.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.113
THAT DOES NOT
MAKE YOU FRAGILE, DEREK.

28:34.113 --> 28:36.315
THAT MAKES YOU
VERY FREAKIN' STRONG.

28:36.315 --> 28:39.989
I AM STANDING IN A BUILDING
FULL OF PILLS RIGHT NOW,

28:39.989 --> 28:41.190
A FACT THAT I AM
PAINFULLY AWARE OF,

28:41.190 --> 28:44.123
BUT I AM DOING THIS.

28:44.123 --> 28:46.155
THAT IS NOT FRAGILE.

28:46.155 --> 28:49.298
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

29:02.141 --> 29:03.342
OKAY.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.374
SHOW ME
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

29:05.374 --> 29:09.048
SO YOU THINK THERE'S A WAY?

29:09.048 --> 29:11.220
NO, I DON'T.

29:11.220 --> 29:15.224
BUT I CAN'T STOP YOU,
SO, UM...

29:15.224 --> 29:17.356
I'LL BE HERE WITH YOU.

29:17.356 --> 29:20.189
SHOW ME
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.233
(speaking indistinctly)

29:24.233 --> 29:27.236
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

29:27.236 --> 29:31.170
(indistinct conversations)

29:31.170 --> 29:32.241
(sighs)

29:32.241 --> 29:34.243
I WAS RIGHT.

29:34.243 --> 29:36.305
RIGHT?

29:36.305 --> 29:38.247
TOO SOON TO TELL.

29:38.247 --> 29:40.179
CUT THE CRAP, TORRES.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.211
YOU TWO ARE GONNA PUT
A TOE ON A MAN'S HAND.

29:42.211 --> 29:44.253
THAT WAS HER IDEA.

29:44.253 --> 29:45.354
MAYBE WE ARE.

29:45.354 --> 29:48.117
HIS TOE?!
ARE YOU SERIOUS?!

29:48.117 --> 29:50.159
MAYBE WE'RE NOT.
(elevator bell dings)

29:50.159 --> 29:51.290
TOMMY, CALM DOWN.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.322
I-I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO YELL.

29:53.322 --> 29:54.393
IT'S JUST...

29:54.393 --> 29:56.065
THAT'S WEIRD.

29:56.065 --> 29:58.097
YEAH.
BUT IF I SAY OKAY,

29:58.097 --> 29:59.398
I GET MY HAND BACK?

29:59.398 --> 30:01.400
OTHERWISE, YOU FIT ME
FOR A HOOK?

30:01.400 --> 30:03.302
A PROSTHETIC, BUT IF YOU
GIVE THE GO-AHEAD--

30:03.302 --> 30:04.403
HE GETS A HAND.

30:07.136 --> 30:09.308
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT ME FOR?

30:09.308 --> 30:11.080
TAKE MY TOE ALREADY.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.142
TAKE MY LEFT NUT
IF IT'LL HELP.

30:13.142 --> 30:15.444
I... THINK THE TOE
WILL BE FINE.

30:15.444 --> 30:17.086
(speaking indistinctly)

30:17.086 --> 30:18.147
(elevator bell dings)

30:18.147 --> 30:21.090
I WAS RIGHT.

30:21.090 --> 30:22.291
SO... (sighs)

30:22.291 --> 30:24.123
THIS IS HOW YOU'RE GONNA
SPEND YOUR TIME NOW,

30:24.123 --> 30:25.254
PULLING STRINGS
BEHIND THE SCENES

30:25.254 --> 30:27.396
LIKE SOME KIND
OF PUPPET MASTER?

30:27.396 --> 30:30.229
I AM REALLY GOOD AT IT.

30:30.229 --> 30:33.202
(indistinct conversations
continue)

30:33.202 --> 30:34.333
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

30:34.333 --> 30:35.464
(indistinct conversations)

30:35.464 --> 30:37.206
SO I'M A 2-MONTH-OLD BABY.

30:37.206 --> 30:38.267
SYMPTOMS?

30:38.267 --> 30:39.468
I'M UNDERWEIGHT, FUSSY,
I BELCH,

30:39.468 --> 30:41.270
AND WHEN I VOMIT,
IT HITS THE CEILING.

30:41.270 --> 30:43.272
YOU HAVE PYLORIC STENOSIS.

30:43.272 --> 30:46.345
THESE CARDS ARE SO DETAILED.
WHOSE ARE THESE?

30:46.345 --> 30:50.349
UH, WELL, THOSE WOULD BE
THE SMART ONE'S.

30:50.349 --> 30:53.182
THE ONLY SMART ONE.

30:53.182 --> 30:55.184
WHAT THE HELL?

30:55.184 --> 30:56.325
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MORGAN'S BABY?

30:56.325 --> 30:58.427
WAIT. MORGAN HAD HER BABY?

30:58.427 --> 31:01.460
OH, CRAP.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.332
(Kathleen Edwards'
"Change the Sheets" playing)

31:03.332 --> 31:04.493
ONE MORE CLAMP, PLEASE.

31:04.493 --> 31:06.365
WELL, IS IT SUBCLAVIAN?
CAN YOU GET UNDER THE CLAVICLE?

31:06.365 --> 31:09.138
VASCULAR CLAMP.
IT'S STILL OOZING, DR. AVERY.

31:09.138 --> 31:11.140
HOW DO YOU WANT TO PROCEED?

31:11.140 --> 31:13.202
UM... I, UH, I DON'T--
I DON'T KNOW.

31:13.202 --> 31:14.403
OH, HE DID NOT JUST SAY
"I DON'T KNOW."

31:14.403 --> 31:17.146
MAN, TELL ME
WHAT YOU SEE.

31:17.146 --> 31:18.207
WE'RE STARING
STRAIGHT AT THE DEFECT.

31:18.207 --> 31:19.308
YOU THINK WE SHOULD
CALL IN VASCULAR?

31:19.308 --> 31:20.509
NO, NO, I THINK--I THINK
WE CAN REPAIR THIS OURSELF.

31:20.509 --> 31:22.481
UM, MAYBE PATCH IT?
STICK--STICK TIE.

31:22.481 --> 31:24.153
PATCH IT?

31:24.153 --> 31:25.284
YEAH. ISN'T THAT--

31:25.284 --> 31:27.286
NO, NO, IT'S A GOOD THOUGHT.
GET ON THAT.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.387
BOVIE.
