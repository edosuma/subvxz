WEBVTT

01:22.813 --> 01:24.647
Gentlemen!

01:24.813 --> 01:28.355
That's it for today.
Turn everything off!

01:28.688 --> 01:31.813
Change your clothes.
The buses are waiting.

01:31.980 --> 01:33.105
Get a move on!

01:33.272 --> 01:36.397
Are you deaf? I said turn it off.

01:36.772 --> 01:37.813
Hurry up!

01:37.980 --> 01:42.272
The factory's closing
while we wait for raw materials.

01:42.480 --> 01:44.480
You will be paid.

01:44.855 --> 01:49.938
We'll contact you next week
about your wages.

01:50.105 --> 01:53.313
Go back to the dorms!

01:53.480 --> 01:55.188
Get out of your uniforms,

01:55.355 --> 01:59.522
take all your things
and get on the buses.

01:59.688 --> 02:02.730
If you dawdle,
you won't find a ride out tonight.

02:11.897 --> 02:12.897
We're closing!

02:13.063 --> 02:15.063
Get up, hurry!

02:15.355 --> 02:17.063
Move it!

02:17.355 --> 02:21.147
And don't even think about going to HR.

02:21.313 --> 02:23.772
Don't cause trouble for yourselves.

02:23.938 --> 02:26.647
The factory
could press charges against you.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.980
You could be arrested

02:29.147 --> 02:31.522
and lose your pay.

04:01.938 --> 04:03.022
Hello.

04:05.147 --> 04:06.772
Have a seat.

04:38.897 --> 04:41.105
Hello, Bayram.

04:42.147 --> 04:43.647
Thank you.

04:43.813 --> 04:46.147
- Sit down, please.
- No, thank you.

04:47.813 --> 04:50.063
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

06:34.897 --> 06:36.105
8 MONTHS
NO PAY

06:36.272 --> 06:37.605
28 MONTHS
NO HEALTHCARE

07:36.230 --> 07:37.522
Hello.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.272
Ghardashali,

07:44.855 --> 07:48.188
I'm not imposing anything on anyone.

07:48.855 --> 07:51.313
Personally, I'm still mourning.

07:54.147 --> 07:56.605
You're free to do
what you think is right.

07:56.772 --> 08:00.313
Bayram, you know that
as long as you're in mourning,

08:00.480 --> 08:02.563
we'll all wear black.

08:08.772 --> 08:11.813
Say a prayer for the deceased!

08:18.230 --> 08:20.563
May Gholam rest in peace,
my dear Bayram.

08:20.730 --> 08:22.147
May God protect you.

08:22.313 --> 08:24.480
- A small gift.
- You shouldn't have.

08:24.647 --> 08:29.063
Gholam was my cousin,
but he was like a father to me.

08:29.230 --> 08:32.188
That's very kind, really,
but you shouldn't have.

08:32.355 --> 08:36.480
If I may, I'd also like
to trim your hair and beard

08:36.647 --> 08:38.980
to take you out of mourning.

08:39.355 --> 08:41.230
Are you suddenly a barber?

08:41.688 --> 08:44.063
Go sit down and let us convince him.

08:44.230 --> 08:46.272
- This way.
- Come sit.

08:46.772 --> 08:48.397
Come have a seat.

08:51.188 --> 08:52.438
Make yourself comfortable.

08:52.605 --> 08:53.646
Bayram,

08:53.647 --> 08:57.022
as long as you wear black
the family will, too.

08:58.272 --> 09:02.563
Alright, trim your hair and beards
and stop wearing black.

09:02.730 --> 09:04.897
With all due respect,

09:05.147 --> 09:07.105
Gholam was our patriarch,

09:07.272 --> 09:09.730
we're waiting for you
to name his successor.

09:10.438 --> 09:11.730
But I'm still mourning.

09:12.063 --> 09:13.355
It's been a year!

09:13.647 --> 09:15.522
Succession obeys its own rules.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.730
You'll read his will when I see fit.

09:17.897 --> 09:18.938
His will?

09:19.105 --> 09:21.147
You haven't opened it yet?

09:21.522 --> 09:22.522
Of course I have.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.688
And no one knows anything?

09:24.855 --> 09:26.938
My father asked
for one year deferment.

09:27.230 --> 09:28.312
And now?

09:28.313 --> 09:29.730
I'm not ready yet.

09:30.063 --> 09:35.772
Dad, four couples
are waiting to plan their weddings.

09:36.105 --> 09:38.355
You're not speaking for yourself?

09:38.938 --> 09:42.313
Everyone's saying it.
Come here, Dad.

09:44.522 --> 09:46.813
I understand him.
He's tired of waiting.

09:47.647 --> 09:51.980
We all thought your son
would get married after the 40th day,

09:52.147 --> 09:55.188
and that the others would follow.

09:56.647 --> 10:00.938
Honestly, if you let these poor kids
get on with their lives,

10:01.105 --> 10:03.730
no one will think less of you.

10:11.897 --> 10:13.522
Please, Bayram.

10:13.688 --> 10:15.272
Let us say a prayer!

11:26.355 --> 11:30.688
The bastards are the ones who flee,
counting on their colleagues

11:30.855 --> 11:33.147
to fight for their wages.

11:38.355 --> 11:39.688
Just use the trimmer.

11:41.397 --> 11:42.855
I'll let you know.

11:43.272 --> 11:44.938
I'll call you back.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.313
Bye.

11:50.897 --> 11:54.022
Name the successor today
and get it over with.

11:54.188 --> 11:56.063
Are you pressing for Ghardashali?

11:56.230 --> 11:58.647
He offered to plan
your son's wedding.

11:58.938 --> 12:00.272
My son has a father.

12:00.438 --> 12:02.022
Excuse me, Bayram.

12:02.188 --> 12:05.272
Ghardashali
deserves to be patriarch.

12:05.438 --> 12:07.563
But I'm the eldest.

12:07.730 --> 12:10.480
Say, Ghardashali?
Is he the eldest?

12:11.230 --> 12:12.730
- Who?
- Esmail.

12:12.897 --> 12:15.813
That piker shirks weddings
to avoid giving gifts.

12:15.980 --> 12:17.397
He's after free lunches.

12:17.563 --> 12:19.772
That's no way to speak in public.

12:20.313 --> 12:23.105
He hasn't even helped his own children.

12:23.272 --> 12:25.230
What a patriarch he'd make!

12:25.605 --> 12:28.147
Show some decency.
Who's older, you or him?

12:28.522 --> 12:30.063
Me, obviously.

12:30.230 --> 12:31.397
God is my witness,

12:31.563 --> 12:35.063
I don't expect to be Gholam's successor.

12:35.230 --> 12:38.147
Be my guest.
We're all behind you!

12:38.480 --> 12:41.438
I was six when you were born,
Ghardashali.

12:41.605 --> 12:43.313
My mother nursed you.

12:43.480 --> 12:46.563
It's not only about age.

12:46.730 --> 12:48.022
Exactly.

12:48.188 --> 12:50.355
I was just saying I'm the eldest.

12:50.522 --> 12:54.605
While Ghardashali
was Gholam's friend in his last moments.

12:54.980 --> 12:56.563
Well said!

12:56.730 --> 13:00.897
If Gholam is satisfied,
we'll all be satisfied!

15:41.438 --> 15:46.188
LEILA'S BROTHERS

15:46.355 --> 15:49.563
A film by Saeed Roustaee

16:03.480 --> 16:05.855
Did you know it was my crib?

16:06.022 --> 16:07.730
It was mine.

16:07.897 --> 16:09.980
Yes, it was all of ours.

16:10.147 --> 16:11.647
You still in there, Dad?

16:11.813 --> 16:13.855
I can't help it. It hurts.

16:14.022 --> 16:16.605
Leila,
you've used up all the city's water.

16:16.772 --> 16:19.022
Take me to see a doctor, Alireza.

16:19.313 --> 16:20.438
Take him where?

16:20.605 --> 16:22.355
Ignore him, he's fine.

16:26.980 --> 16:29.230
Where's my car key? Dad!

16:29.397 --> 16:31.022
You didn't pay me yesterday.

16:31.188 --> 16:33.230
I was at the garage all day.

16:33.397 --> 16:34.772
Where's the second key?

16:34.938 --> 16:36.730
If you touch it,

16:37.772 --> 16:40.480
I'll call the police on you!

16:41.855 --> 16:44.397
Do what you did to Parviz.

16:44.563 --> 16:47.397
Go ahead and take me to court.

16:52.897 --> 16:55.730
Shut the water off, I don't have any!

16:57.022 --> 16:58.605
Let's take the elevator.

16:58.772 --> 17:00.688
I can't breathe in that thing!

17:00.855 --> 17:02.230
Is it a boy?

17:02.480 --> 17:03.522
I swear it is.

17:03.688 --> 17:06.438
You swear nonsense.

17:06.605 --> 17:07.938
Swear on Manouchehr's life!

17:08.105 --> 17:09.896
On Farhad's life, it's a boy.

17:10.938 --> 17:12.855
That means it's a girl.

17:13.021 --> 17:15.438
Don't bug them
about naming him Gholam.

17:15.605 --> 17:16.813
Butt out.

17:16.980 --> 17:18.980
You're the one who's butting in.

17:19.355 --> 17:21.313
For Gholam's memorial,

17:21.480 --> 17:25.563
I was the first to be dressed in white
and have my beard trimmed.

17:25.730 --> 17:27.605
It's expected of me.

17:27.771 --> 17:29.730
Come meet the baby, will you?

17:29.897 --> 17:30.980
Where's Manouchehr?

17:31.147 --> 17:34.230
The sissy
can't handle the smell of hospitals.

17:39.147 --> 17:41.522
Finally, someone who's not empty-handed!

17:41.688 --> 17:43.730
Hello, my sweethearts!

17:43.897 --> 17:45.313
Good to see you.

17:45.772 --> 17:47.605
You're lucky this one's a boy.

17:47.772 --> 17:50.605
Yep. He'd keep harassing me otherwise.

17:53.522 --> 17:54.897
Congratulations.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.897
Let me kiss my grandchild.

17:58.188 --> 18:00.480
You can't kiss a newborn's face.

18:00.647 --> 18:01.730
It's not a boy.

18:02.022 --> 18:03.480
'Course it is, check.

18:03.647 --> 18:05.147
Have her undress him then.

18:05.313 --> 18:06.438
He'll catch cold.

18:07.272 --> 18:11.272
For every one of those five girls,
they told me it was a boy.

18:11.438 --> 18:15.897
After 2 years, I'd suddenly see them
wearing skirts and earrings.

18:16.063 --> 18:17.772
This time, they won't fool me.

18:18.188 --> 18:19.271
Undress him!

18:19.272 --> 18:21.730
It's not easy to unwrap.

18:21.897 --> 18:24.022
Don't delude me, evil woman!

18:24.522 --> 18:27.022
Calm down, sir.
You're in a hospital.

18:27.188 --> 18:28.188
Please leave.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.341
Forgive him.

18:29.355 --> 18:30.813
You're embarrassing us.

18:30.980 --> 18:34.022
Leila, show him
before he has a heart attack.

18:34.188 --> 18:35.188
Come look.

18:37.605 --> 18:38.772
Hold on.

18:41.938 --> 18:44.188
There we are.

18:52.022 --> 18:53.647
What a joy.

18:54.980 --> 18:56.563
It's a boy!

18:59.522 --> 19:01.022
It's a boy.

19:01.188 --> 19:02.397
See that?

19:02.563 --> 19:04.897
Didn't he have enough boys?

19:05.063 --> 19:06.897
He's your humble servant.

19:14.688 --> 19:17.730
Look at those lashes.
He's so handsome...

19:44.730 --> 19:48.063
Don't pout, eat.
I'll take you to a doctor tomorrow.

20:02.147 --> 20:04.813
Damn that Brock Lesnar!

20:04.980 --> 20:08.855
The only guy who can beat Undertaker
is Lesnar.

20:09.022 --> 20:11.355
- It's all phony.
- It is not.

20:11.522 --> 20:14.813
Hardy jumps from a 30-ft ladder
onto Big Show's face.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.438
Is that phony?

20:16.605 --> 20:21.397
She forgets our names,
but she knows the wrestlers' by heart!

20:21.563 --> 20:23.230
That's your fault.

20:23.397 --> 20:25.980
Orton's gonna crush Lesnar, Mom.

20:26.147 --> 20:27.522
He's no Shawn Michaels.

20:27.688 --> 20:30.105
I have the same build as Orton,
don't I?

20:30.272 --> 20:34.355
Stop it, you orangutan!
Put your clothes back on!

20:34.522 --> 20:35.938
Are they dressed?

20:36.105 --> 20:39.397
Sister-in-law, it's my back again.
Take the baby.

20:39.563 --> 20:41.438
I'm so sorry.

20:41.471 --> 20:42.458
Ouch!

20:42.480 --> 20:44.772
Don't do the dishes.

20:44.938 --> 20:47.855
Get married and that pain'll go away.

20:48.022 --> 20:51.397
Farhad,
you can't just eat and do nothing.

20:51.563 --> 20:53.772
We should deal with the dishes.

20:53.938 --> 20:56.355
- I'm still eating.
- I mean in general.

20:56.522 --> 20:58.980
You ruminate like a cow.
That's enough.

20:59.147 --> 21:00.938
Do you mean me or Parviz?

21:01.105 --> 21:02.438
Wait till we clear the dishes.

21:02.605 --> 21:04.980
In two minutes,
he'll have his pants down.

21:05.147 --> 21:07.730
Dad, blow for the baby.

21:07.897 --> 21:10.188
He's in a hurry to go home.

21:10.522 --> 21:13.022
Because he knows what he's done.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.605
Congratulations.

21:14.772 --> 21:16.563
What's the matter with you?

21:16.730 --> 21:18.855
May he have a long and happy life.

21:20.772 --> 21:21.772
Tell me,

21:21.897 --> 21:24.397
what's the name
on the birth certificate?

21:24.563 --> 21:26.730
The name you asked for.

21:26.897 --> 21:28.813
- What name is that?
- Gholam.

21:29.563 --> 21:30.563
Gholam.

21:31.355 --> 21:33.522
- Show me his record.
- We don't have it.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.855
What is this then?

21:36.022 --> 21:38.522
I picked it up today.
Parviz didn't know.

21:38.938 --> 21:41.313
Read it and tell me
what they named the kid.

21:43.980 --> 21:44.980
It's Gholam.

21:45.688 --> 21:46.813
Gholam.

21:46.980 --> 21:48.980
What is it to us?

21:50.105 --> 21:52.688
Alireza,
are they telling me the truth?

22:03.897 --> 22:04.897
Yes. It's Gholam.

22:05.313 --> 22:08.813
Where does it say Gholam?
Point the word out to me.

22:10.272 --> 22:11.480
Right here.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.313
Give me my bank card.

22:20.554 --> 22:21.580
Why?

22:21.605 --> 22:23.647
I don't want you to have it.

22:47.772 --> 22:49.147
DEATH ANNOUNCEMENT

22:55.105 --> 22:56.105
GHOLAM

22:57.313 --> 22:58.438
POUYAN

23:05.813 --> 23:06.980
It's not Gholam!

23:07.147 --> 23:09.563
Get out, you dirty liars!

23:09.897 --> 23:13.022
I knew the bastards wouldn't listen.

23:13.188 --> 23:16.022
Get out, you thief!

23:16.188 --> 23:17.647
Think of your heart.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.105
You're scaring the girls.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.897
- Get lost, all of you.
- They're gone.

23:22.063 --> 23:23.104
You, come here.

23:23.105 --> 23:24.730
What's gotten into you, Dad?

23:24.897 --> 23:27.063
Have you lost your mind?

23:27.230 --> 23:30.563
He steals my pension
and he steals from my home.

23:30.730 --> 23:33.188
Leila put it in my bag.

23:33.605 --> 23:36.313
Raheleh is breastfeeding, Dad!

23:40.063 --> 23:43.522
After a year, my wife
finally comes to dinner. Thank you.

23:44.022 --> 23:45.188
Get over here.

24:05.105 --> 24:06.647
Stop it, Dad.

24:10.522 --> 24:12.772
He doesn't want to name his son Gholam!

24:13.605 --> 24:15.480
Go to hell, both of you!

24:15.647 --> 24:18.355
You could've named
one of your four sons Gholam!

24:18.522 --> 24:21.563
Gholam was still alive then.
It isn't done, fool.

24:21.730 --> 24:23.688
Screw your traditions!

24:23.897 --> 24:26.355
Bayram can name
his own grandkid Gholam.

24:26.688 --> 24:28.022
We'd preempt him!

24:28.188 --> 24:29.397
What for?

24:29.563 --> 24:31.647
To hold our heads up high.

24:31.813 --> 24:35.355
Did being named after your father
bring me luck?

24:35.522 --> 24:40.105
Why would I have to name my son
after your half-wit cousin?

25:09.730 --> 25:12.897
You're eligible
for unemployment benefits.

25:13.063 --> 25:16.105
Stay home every day
from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.

25:16.272 --> 25:18.147
We run inspections.

25:18.313 --> 25:22.397
If you're absent,
your benefits will be suspended.

25:22.772 --> 25:24.938
Excuse me, miss, I filled this out.

25:25.105 --> 25:26.480
Sign here.

25:26.897 --> 25:28.938
First floor, employment department.

25:29.772 --> 25:31.438
When do I look for a job?

25:31.605 --> 25:36.647
There are a lot of layoffs these days.
We're very strict.

25:37.772 --> 25:39.855
To keep your benefits,

25:40.022 --> 25:41.730
follow the rules listed here.

25:41.732 --> 25:42.750
Thanks.

25:42.772 --> 25:44.813
Miss, this letter came for me.

25:46.022 --> 25:48.397
Booth number 7, income department.

25:50.480 --> 25:51.980
There's a seat here.

25:52.605 --> 25:55.105
I'll go get a number.

25:55.397 --> 25:56.772
Have a seat, Dad.

26:03.272 --> 26:05.313
- Wait in line.
- It's just a form.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.605
Internal medicine, Jourablou.

26:10.897 --> 26:12.355
It's packed...

26:12.522 --> 26:15.813
It's a state hospital. Could be worse.

26:17.480 --> 26:18.688
Excuse me, ma'am.

26:24.355 --> 26:26.480
Dad, we're right here.

26:38.730 --> 26:42.313
Could you please not ask Mom and Dad
how they're feeling?

26:42.368 --> 26:43.438
Why?

26:43.605 --> 26:47.105
I've worked hard weening them off
asking for a doctor every day.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.022
You show up, and here we go again.

26:49.188 --> 26:50.688
So they're afraid of you?

26:50.938 --> 26:53.022
Worse, they hate me.

26:53.730 --> 26:55.230
But they're sick...

26:56.813 --> 26:58.855
You have no idea, Alireza.

26:59.230 --> 27:01.647
At their age, they need checkups.

27:01.813 --> 27:04.897
Every doctor in town knows us.

27:05.397 --> 27:08.730
I'm only here for four days.

27:09.897 --> 27:11.688
Why are you saying that?

27:13.397 --> 27:15.397
Things are tense, so you run for it?

27:15.563 --> 27:17.397
I have to go back to work.

27:17.563 --> 27:20.688
You can't lie to me
the way you lie to the others.

27:21.063 --> 27:24.230
You're out of a job,
like your brothers.

27:24.397 --> 27:26.397
You're unemployed.

27:26.980 --> 27:30.522
You only have to spend one night at home
for me to know

27:30.688 --> 27:32.105
everything about you.

27:32.272 --> 27:33.397
You were fired.

27:33.563 --> 27:36.897
You get fired
when you do something wrong.

27:37.063 --> 27:39.772
The owner was crooked,
the factory went bankrupt.

27:39.938 --> 27:42.855
They laid us off. We weren't fired.

27:43.272 --> 27:46.647
Then stop pretending
you're on vacation.

27:47.813 --> 27:51.355
Tell them you can't take them
to the doctor's every day

27:51.522 --> 27:55.897
because you have to be home
to not lose your benefits.

27:56.980 --> 27:58.188
Sit down.

28:07.272 --> 28:09.438
Who else knows I lost my job?

28:09.813 --> 28:14.855
Mom was thanking God
she had a son who'd have a pension.

28:15.022 --> 28:17.688
Since she found out, she's lost.

28:17.855 --> 28:19.022
How did she find out?

28:19.772 --> 28:20.897
I told her.

28:21.063 --> 28:24.813
I'll find a job quickly.
I don't like being idle.

28:25.605 --> 28:29.188
A job won't change things.
We have to do something.

28:34.730 --> 28:36.147
Alireza...

28:37.355 --> 28:39.313
start a juicy business

28:39.980 --> 28:43.188
and involve your brothers
to help them out of poverty.

28:43.688 --> 28:47.730
Don't pressure me.
Why would that be my responsibility?

28:47.980 --> 28:51.022
I tried, but I couldn't pull it off.

28:51.188 --> 28:54.688
Why not ask Manouchehr?
You have three other brothers.

28:54.855 --> 28:57.897
Manouchehr is one of the things
I'm worried about!

28:58.272 --> 29:03.022
If we do nothing,
he'll get caught with all his scheming.

29:03.188 --> 29:07.105
I was counting on you to back me,
to take my side,

29:07.272 --> 29:09.897
and act with discernment.

29:10.772 --> 29:15.480
Parviz can't carry his weight.
He's always looking for a place to sit.

29:15.647 --> 29:17.813
Farhad thinks with his abs.

29:17.980 --> 29:19.105
Pretend I never came.

29:19.272 --> 29:21.355
I can't, you're here.

29:21.522 --> 29:23.605
My presence wouldn't change anything.

29:23.980 --> 29:28.313
My salary
is what keeps us from starving.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.563
But...

29:32.230 --> 29:34.105
Sorry, can we swap seats?

29:34.647 --> 29:35.647
Yes.

29:36.147 --> 29:37.147
Thanks.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.272
What about my wages?

29:43.605 --> 29:47.688
Your income, mine and dad's pension
is still not enough.

29:47.980 --> 29:50.063
They've stagnated all their lives.

29:50.397 --> 29:52.397
Not "they," we!

29:53.022 --> 29:55.897
We're not stagnating,
we're regressing.

29:56.063 --> 29:58.980
Regressing from where?
What did we have to lose?

29:59.647 --> 30:00.730
Our youth.

30:01.938 --> 30:03.480
Which is slipping away.

30:03.647 --> 30:06.272
Let's try to not end up
old and beggarly.

30:06.563 --> 30:07.730
Brother...

30:08.438 --> 30:10.230
don't listen to Mom and Dad.

30:10.772 --> 30:12.522
By night, they sleep.

30:12.688 --> 30:16.188
By day,
they think about sleeping soundly.

30:17.397 --> 30:20.980
Everyone's miserable at home.
They hate each other.

30:21.147 --> 30:24.897
It breaks my heart
to see them take their anger

30:25.063 --> 30:26.522
out on each other.

30:29.355 --> 30:31.938
Start a business with them.

30:36.772 --> 30:39.563
Even though
I hate seeing my brothers jobless,

30:39.730 --> 30:42.022
I was happy you were fired.

30:43.188 --> 30:46.105
I was finally going to be able
to ask you

30:47.063 --> 30:49.730
not to abandon your brothers.

30:49.897 --> 30:52.022
They're on their own.

30:52.355 --> 30:57.147
They're lost and broke.
Don't leave them like this.

30:58.063 --> 31:02.063
If you leave again,
what will become of them?

31:05.355 --> 31:07.855
Tell them to get their act together.

31:08.022 --> 31:10.355
I have. They can't.

31:10.522 --> 31:11.522
Why not?

31:11.938 --> 31:14.230
They don't know
how to start a business.

31:14.397 --> 31:15.397
And I do?

31:15.522 --> 31:18.772
If somebody does, it's you.

31:20.105 --> 31:23.188
Suppose we did. Who'd work?
Those lazy bums?

31:23.355 --> 31:25.605
They're not lazy. They're working.

31:25.772 --> 31:27.480
But they have meanly jobs.

31:27.938 --> 31:29.688
Alright, but they're morons.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.397
They're not morons.

31:31.563 --> 31:34.855
Poverty makes you lose your confidence
and look stupid.

31:35.230 --> 31:38.355
I don't like conflict, sis'.

31:38.522 --> 31:41.147
It stresses me out when everyone yells.

31:41.313 --> 31:44.355
I want to work out of town
and come back on occasion.

31:44.605 --> 31:49.063
I'm begging you, don't involve me.

31:49.230 --> 31:51.105
They're your family.

31:51.272 --> 31:54.980
I gave up a year of back wages,

31:55.147 --> 31:57.897
to get away
from the ruckus at the factory.

31:59.022 --> 32:01.855
I hate my family's hysteria.

32:02.022 --> 32:04.855
Insecure jobs make people hysterical.

32:05.022 --> 32:07.772
The harder you work, the poorer you are.

32:08.647 --> 32:11.980
Poverty is hard to shake off.

32:12.313 --> 32:15.272
The more you swallow,
the more there is.

32:15.438 --> 32:18.272
All of that is why I left.

32:18.855 --> 32:20.230
So you're saying

32:20.397 --> 32:24.355
you came back
only to stay if things were rosy.

32:24.522 --> 32:26.147
And if they weren't...

32:29.147 --> 32:31.105
Don't cry, Leila.

32:32.688 --> 32:36.813
Can't you start something
that's actually a real job?

32:38.397 --> 32:41.397
So when you fill out a form,
under "occupation"

32:41.563 --> 32:43.730
you can put something down?

33:12.855 --> 33:15.938
Yes, I told him about it.

33:16.105 --> 33:17.855
It's settled.

33:19.022 --> 33:21.605
Why do you neglect yourself so much?

33:21.772 --> 33:23.772
You weren't this fat last time.

33:23.938 --> 33:27.022
I don't get much exercise
with this damn job.

33:27.188 --> 33:28.355
He started drinking.

33:28.522 --> 33:30.730
Shut up. It's my thyroid.

33:31.022 --> 33:33.688
Doctor says
drinking doesn't help the thyroid.

33:34.063 --> 33:36.730
Our place is small, the kids are noisy.

33:37.313 --> 33:39.355
Sometimes I drink to get to sleep.

33:40.188 --> 33:41.980
- Where you going?
- To the bathroom.

33:42.313 --> 33:43.397
Let it dry.

33:43.563 --> 33:44.813
I really need to go.

33:44.980 --> 33:46.647
- Got any cash?
- Yes.

33:47.022 --> 33:48.355
Go ahead.

33:52.813 --> 33:55.688
White tiles need constant cleaning.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.563
Why'd you ask us to come?

33:58.980 --> 34:02.647
They want to turn the bathroom
into a bunch of shops.

34:03.313 --> 34:05.980
He's right. It's being green-lit.

34:06.147 --> 34:07.688
What's it to us?

34:07.855 --> 34:09.188
I thought you should see it.

34:09.355 --> 34:11.772
Alireza, we have to act quickly.

34:11.938 --> 34:15.438
The other shop owners
will soon get their claws into it.

34:15.605 --> 34:18.272
To become wealthy,
you have to be in the know.

34:18.438 --> 34:19.938
Where'd you hear it?

34:20.105 --> 34:21.730
Nowhere. It's my flare.

34:21.897 --> 34:22.897
Stop it.

34:23.730 --> 34:26.688
I overheard your financial manager here.

34:27.605 --> 34:30.772
I asked if we could buy
a small shop with a loan.

34:31.355 --> 34:33.397
- Price per square foot?
- 15 to 20 million.

34:33.563 --> 34:35.105
We can't afford it.

34:35.272 --> 34:37.397
I can barely afford a square foot.

34:37.563 --> 34:39.438
The others are worse off.

34:39.688 --> 34:42.188
Give it a chance.
Maybe we can pull it off.

34:42.355 --> 34:43.605
My boss likes me.

34:43.772 --> 34:45.730
Even without a deposit, we can't.

34:45.897 --> 34:48.230
Are you a naysayer
like Manouchehr now?

34:48.522 --> 34:51.188
Fine. Where would we find the money?

35:02.897 --> 35:05.105
Alright, never mind.

35:05.605 --> 35:07.438
You're not letting them think.

35:07.605 --> 35:10.022
Buying a shop requires money,
not thought.

35:10.188 --> 35:12.188
This scale is off.

35:13.647 --> 35:15.272
If you want it, it'll work.

35:15.438 --> 35:17.147
Suppose I did.

35:17.397 --> 35:19.272
You have to actually want it!

35:19.563 --> 35:21.313
Is it all on me?

35:22.980 --> 35:25.813
I'm all for it.
That's why I'm here.

35:25.980 --> 35:28.063
I asked you to come. I want it.

35:28.397 --> 35:30.147
If we're just talking, I do too.

35:30.313 --> 35:32.438
We all want it deep down.

35:33.147 --> 35:35.938
Same here. Me too.

35:37.438 --> 35:38.438
Where you going?

35:39.647 --> 35:42.230
Last time, I paid for two visits.

35:42.397 --> 35:43.772
I don't remember that.

35:44.105 --> 35:45.105
How much?

35:45.230 --> 35:46.230
What did you do?

35:46.897 --> 35:49.397
What?
I used the bathroom for a minute.

35:49.730 --> 35:52.980
You took longer than a minute.
Gimme 500.

35:56.022 --> 35:58.230
Do you have change this time?

35:58.397 --> 36:00.272
No. I won't charge you next time.

36:00.438 --> 36:01.813
What if you forget again?

36:01.980 --> 36:04.647
You'll remind me, jog my memory.

36:06.813 --> 36:10.147
If he files a complaint,
I'll have no other job for you.

36:27.147 --> 36:30.188
Wake him up,
so he can sleep in his bed.

36:30.355 --> 36:34.772
Since he got his pacemaker,
he often sleeps like that.

36:34.938 --> 36:38.147
He says that if he lies down,
he feels like he's dying.

36:38.647 --> 36:40.355
Go listen.

37:09.272 --> 37:10.772
Look, son.

37:10.980 --> 37:15.105
If I don't bandage myself,
it tingles all night.

37:15.272 --> 37:16.605
Shouldn't we see a doctor?

37:16.813 --> 37:19.022
Sure. I'll see to it tomorrow.

37:19.730 --> 37:22.938
We have a lot to do tomorrow.
Don't make promises.

37:24.980 --> 37:27.480
Here, Mom, take your pills.

37:29.522 --> 37:32.563
And use your ointment
against the tingling.

37:32.730 --> 37:33.938
Dad.

37:34.105 --> 37:36.313
Don't, he just fell asleep.

37:36.480 --> 37:37.563
Take your pills.

37:37.730 --> 37:39.438
He'll take them tomorrow.

37:39.605 --> 37:42.313
If he doesn't take them,
he'll be sick tomorrow.

37:50.480 --> 37:51.897
Mom loves the big guys.

37:52.647 --> 37:55.230
Triple H, Brock Lesnar, Big Show.

37:55.647 --> 37:58.730
That's why she loves Parviz so much.

37:58.980 --> 38:02.355
With her bandages,
she could all knock 'em all out.

38:05.897 --> 38:07.522
Don't get in front of the TV.

38:08.188 --> 38:11.938
I called Manouchehr about the shop.

38:12.105 --> 38:13.105
And?

38:13.272 --> 38:16.688
He says that our problem is the deposit,

38:16.855 --> 38:18.897
but that he's got a plan.

38:19.313 --> 38:23.105
Is it seducing old, depressed,
rich women?

38:23.730 --> 38:24.772
"Sugar mommy!"

38:24.938 --> 38:27.730
He set up an appointment
for tomorrow night.

38:27.897 --> 38:30.022
He'll explain everything.

38:31.480 --> 38:34.272
He was ashamed
to say we were his brothers.

38:34.772 --> 38:37.022
Why do business with us now?

38:47.813 --> 38:48.980
Good evening.

38:51.355 --> 38:52.480
Why are you here?

38:53.355 --> 38:54.396
Why shouldn't I be?

38:54.397 --> 38:55.813
Wait at my place.

38:56.147 --> 38:59.522
It's a man's thing, sis'.

38:59.688 --> 39:01.272
Then he can't come.

39:01.563 --> 39:04.813
Should I open my mouth
to dump on you?

39:05.272 --> 39:07.272
He shits from his mouth?

39:08.438 --> 39:10.063
That's disgusting!

39:10.522 --> 39:11.980
Just asking.

39:12.147 --> 39:14.897
Go upstairs and rest
until we get back.

39:15.063 --> 39:17.438
I can't go up all those stairs.

39:17.605 --> 39:21.605
Take the elevator,
it's in perfect working order.

39:21.980 --> 39:24.522
I'd rather die than get in that thing.

39:25.688 --> 39:27.355
It takes Parviz up easy.

39:28.105 --> 39:29.072
Nice.

39:29.105 --> 39:31.147
You weigh less.
Here's the remote.

39:32.105 --> 39:34.897
Don't sign anything
until we all discuss it.

39:35.063 --> 39:36.104
Sure.

39:36.105 --> 39:37.897
We're late, hurry.

39:40.855 --> 39:42.313
How you doing, brother?

39:42.980 --> 39:44.605
Good, thanks.

40:37.397 --> 40:39.188
Don't drive off the cliff!

40:39.355 --> 40:42.063
Why on earth would anyone pay money

40:42.230 --> 40:44.480
to buy an apartment in this shithole?

40:44.813 --> 40:47.897
Wait till I get the deed. You'll see.

40:48.563 --> 40:49.688
You don't have a deed?

40:50.063 --> 40:52.688
Not until the gas is hooked up.

40:52.855 --> 40:54.730
Good God, there's no gas?

40:54.897 --> 40:58.688
His unit has two windowless
40 sq. ft bedrooms.

40:58.855 --> 41:01.605
He doesn't even have access
to the staircase.

41:01.772 --> 41:02.772
Is that true?

41:02.897 --> 41:04.647
He's full of shit.

41:04.813 --> 41:06.855
It used to be two stories,
two owners.

41:07.022 --> 41:10.438
The downstairs guy
illegally built a basement.

41:10.605 --> 41:14.647
So the upstairs guy
built a revenge apartment on the roof.

41:14.865 --> 41:15.897
And?

41:16.063 --> 41:18.397
The downstairs guy
blocked off the staircase

41:18.563 --> 41:20.522
and we fitted an elevator outside.

41:20.688 --> 41:22.855
Who'd buy a place like that?

41:23.147 --> 41:26.397
You can brag about your brother
who lives uptown.

41:26.563 --> 41:29.605
Uptown ended way before this back alley.

41:29.772 --> 41:32.313
This is a shantytown, you moron.

41:32.605 --> 41:35.230
Blockhead saw it.
I have a majestic view.

41:35.397 --> 41:39.605
Sure, majestic until someone
builds right in front of it.

41:39.772 --> 41:41.730
Or city hall tears it down.

41:43.063 --> 41:44.647
Look at those cars!

41:45.105 --> 41:46.813
Uptown, he says.

41:48.438 --> 41:50.355
You're something else, Manouchehr.

42:01.938 --> 42:03.188
Let's go.

42:03.355 --> 42:05.855
Prepare to be blown away.

43:10.897 --> 43:14.522
Thanks, Mahmoud.
Great tea!

43:14.897 --> 43:16.147
Help yourself.

43:17.230 --> 43:19.105
I'll leave the tray here.

43:20.772 --> 43:24.188
Mahmoud has a super job here.

43:24.480 --> 43:25.563
You're welcome.

43:25.855 --> 43:29.105
High income, low hassle.

43:29.980 --> 43:32.897
He's making this offer
as a favor to me.

43:33.063 --> 43:34.063
No.

43:34.230 --> 43:37.272
Now that we're roommates,
I love him like a brother.

43:37.647 --> 43:39.272
He lives at your place?

43:39.438 --> 43:41.188
No, I live at his.

43:41.522 --> 43:43.355
Six months ago, I was homeless.

43:43.855 --> 43:46.188
You set all this up in six months?

43:46.605 --> 43:49.563
I didn't set it up, but I run it now.

43:49.730 --> 43:51.855
Does it belong to you or not?

43:52.188 --> 43:53.938
It belongs to whoever works here.

43:54.730 --> 43:57.022
I'm sorry, what's the job exactly?

43:57.188 --> 43:58.397
Let me explain...

43:58.563 --> 43:59.813
May I?

43:59.980 --> 44:04.188
This is a car leasing company.

44:04.355 --> 44:08.313
The factory delivers a Kia Pride
in thirty days for 23 million.

44:08.480 --> 44:12.105
Mahmoud delivers it in three months,
but for 20 million.

44:12.897 --> 44:14.397
Wait, Manouchehr.

44:14.563 --> 44:17.813
Do you get the cars from the factory
or a middleman?

44:17.980 --> 44:19.230
Neither.

44:19.647 --> 44:22.230
We never actually deliver the cars.

44:22.980 --> 44:28.063
I'm sorry, you take people's money
and disappear?

44:28.230 --> 44:29.772
- Come on, brother...
- It's OK.

44:30.522 --> 44:33.605
A fraudster leaves the cash
under his mattress.

44:33.772 --> 44:37.063
I have ten bank accounts.
Manouchehr knows this.

44:37.230 --> 44:40.647
You take the money
and never deliver the car. How?

44:40.813 --> 44:41.813
What's his name?

44:41.838 --> 44:42.818
Alireza.

44:42.855 --> 44:44.522
Ali, it's not complicated.

44:44.688 --> 44:46.938
Listen and you'll understand.

44:47.105 --> 44:49.938
Before me, my brother-in-law was here.

44:50.188 --> 44:54.147
My brother-in-law presold 1,000 cars
and left with the money.

44:54.313 --> 44:56.313
I took over the office.

44:56.688 --> 45:01.730
First, I presold a 1,000 Prides
to pay off my brother-in-law's debt,

45:01.897 --> 45:05.397
to the same people,
before they filed a complaint.

45:05.605 --> 45:06.938
Then,

45:07.105 --> 45:11.063
I presold another 1,000 Prides
and pocketed the money.

45:11.230 --> 45:13.313
So if you take over this office:

45:13.480 --> 45:15.855
First you pay off my debt,

45:16.022 --> 45:20.147
then you pocket the money
from the next 1,000 presales.

45:20.313 --> 45:22.647
And pass the buck to the next guy.

45:22.813 --> 45:25.313
Who will do the same.

45:25.480 --> 45:28.730
First, pay off your debt.
Then, pocket the money.

45:29.147 --> 45:30.587
- So on and so forth.
- It's a cycle.

45:30.688 --> 45:31.855
I get it.

45:32.022 --> 45:35.647
I'm sorry,
so you're looking for a successor?

45:35.813 --> 45:37.855
For someone to take over the office.

45:38.022 --> 45:40.980
Mahmoud is looking for someone
to replace him.

45:41.147 --> 45:44.688
That's all you do from this huge office?

45:44.980 --> 45:46.021
Listen.

45:46.022 --> 45:48.813
1,000 times 20 million
is 20 billion tomans.

45:48.980 --> 45:50.813
In current dollars...

45:50.980 --> 45:53.272
- What's the exchange rate?
- 5,000.

45:54.355 --> 45:55.897
That's 4 million dollars.

45:56.063 --> 45:58.272
We'll be millionaires in dollars!

45:58.438 --> 46:00.605
Don't people file complaints?

46:00.897 --> 46:02.772
Not for two-month delays.

46:03.188 --> 46:04.897
Suppose a handful do.

46:05.063 --> 46:08.313
We buy a couple of Prides,
end of story.

46:08.480 --> 46:09.813
Not necessary!

46:09.980 --> 46:13.313
Throw them back their 20,
and they're happy.

46:13.688 --> 46:16.063
In my opinion, it's very low risk.

46:17.563 --> 46:18.647
Ali...

46:19.605 --> 46:22.855
I left my wife and kids
with 80 million in debt

46:23.022 --> 46:26.772
and came to Tehran
to sit on that couch.

46:27.313 --> 46:31.772
When they pitched it to me,
I was apprehensive.

46:32.105 --> 46:34.813
But now,
my house back home is so big

46:34.980 --> 46:38.355
my wife calls the cops
to find the kids.

46:41.980 --> 46:44.438
My three offices are proof it works.

46:44.772 --> 46:47.188
But you're living in my brother's hovel?

46:48.022 --> 46:50.063
Question of opportunity.

46:50.480 --> 46:53.813
An uptown address,
cheaper than the south, is a no-brainer.

46:54.438 --> 46:57.855
I've seen Mahmoud's advancement
with my own two eyes.

46:58.230 --> 46:59.355
It's impressive.

46:59.730 --> 47:01.147
Are your permits in order?

47:01.730 --> 47:03.980
If they weren't, we couldn't advertise.

47:05.730 --> 47:09.105
How much would it cost
for us to take over?

47:09.480 --> 47:11.605
The rent and advertising costs

47:11.772 --> 47:13.730
are my gift for a year.

47:14.563 --> 47:17.522
But one of you has to sign,
accept responsibility.

47:17.688 --> 47:20.772
Seriously, what more could we ask for?

47:21.105 --> 47:22.438
It's a golden opportunity.

47:22.605 --> 47:23.772
He has a point, Alireza.

47:26.188 --> 47:27.605
And what do we do?

47:27.897 --> 47:29.397
Legally speaking,

47:29.563 --> 47:33.022
if I put the company in my name,

47:33.188 --> 47:36.355
I need a board of directors
of at least four people.

47:36.563 --> 47:39.230
I would be the chairman.

47:39.938 --> 47:41.688
You the CEO.

47:41.855 --> 47:44.730
We thought Parviz
could be vice-chairman.

47:46.188 --> 47:47.647
- At your service.
- Thank you.

47:48.147 --> 47:51.105
And Farhad
could be an ordinary board member.

47:52.605 --> 47:55.230
That's what I had in mind.

47:55.397 --> 47:58.938
Thanks to Mahmoud's advice, of course.

47:59.105 --> 48:00.272
My pleasure.

48:00.480 --> 48:02.147
One more!

48:02.313 --> 48:04.480
On the count of three, laugh.

48:04.647 --> 48:06.230
One, two, three, laugh!

48:09.730 --> 48:11.230
It's a keeper.

48:14.563 --> 48:15.605
Thanks.

48:21.688 --> 48:24.605
I'll say it again:
Kick your roommate out.

48:24.772 --> 48:26.438
If he goes down, you go down.

48:26.605 --> 48:29.105
As soon as I pay off my debt,
I will.

48:29.272 --> 48:33.022
A mere glimpse of your schemes
terrifies me.

48:33.188 --> 48:35.147
I should've gone alone.

48:35.313 --> 48:38.855
Had I known you would freak out
and contaminate the others,

48:39.022 --> 48:41.313
I would've kept you out of it.

48:41.480 --> 48:43.730
Call a spade a spade. He's weak.

48:43.897 --> 48:47.147
Rejecting your scams
makes him weak and scared?

48:47.313 --> 48:50.647
In 8 years at the factory,
he hasn't taken 8 weeks off.

48:50.813 --> 48:54.063
If his ex hadn't married the neighbor,
he would've stayed.

48:54.230 --> 48:57.272
What's that got to do with anything?

48:57.730 --> 49:00.022
Save your breath, Leila.

49:00.188 --> 49:02.980
Instead of telling us what not to do,

49:03.147 --> 49:04.605
tell us what to do.

49:04.772 --> 49:08.147
Do anything
except what Manouchehr suggests.

49:08.480 --> 49:10.647
Like the shop, for example.

49:11.230 --> 49:12.563
There you go.

49:12.730 --> 49:13.897
With what money?

49:14.063 --> 49:16.438
Said like that,
none of us will find any.

49:16.605 --> 49:17.772
How should I say it?

49:17.938 --> 49:20.397
Do you only get excited
if it's illegal?

49:20.563 --> 49:23.563
I'm hard enough on myself.
Get off my case.

49:23.730 --> 49:26.355
Don't listen to your moronic brother.

49:27.230 --> 49:28.772
Tell me how much you have.

49:28.938 --> 49:31.563
If it's to start a business,

49:31.730 --> 49:35.605
I have about 20 million to contribute.

49:35.772 --> 49:36.897
Farhad, what about you?

49:37.063 --> 49:42.980
If I stop driving and sell the car,
20 million.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.074
Parviz?

49:44.105 --> 49:47.230
I swear I have nothing,
except 5 million in debt.

49:47.397 --> 49:49.730
And the money I gave you
last month?

49:49.897 --> 49:51.272
In front of everyone?

49:51.438 --> 49:55.647
With that 4 million
I paid off another debt.

49:56.063 --> 49:57.355
How about you, Leila?

49:57.522 --> 50:01.022
I have 8 million,
and half a gold coin from work.

50:01.188 --> 50:02.897
What about you, mastermind?

50:03.063 --> 50:04.355
800 million.

50:04.730 --> 50:06.813
Nothing, of course! Zilch.

50:07.188 --> 50:08.938
I don't want this.

50:09.897 --> 50:12.188
You want us to leave, is that it?

50:12.355 --> 50:15.730
He wants to have dinner
with his roommate.

50:15.938 --> 50:19.147
I can't eat at home
when I'm not in my house clothes.

50:19.313 --> 50:20.354
How cute.

50:20.355 --> 50:22.855
Go change, instead of being a grump.

50:23.022 --> 50:24.772
For once you have us over.

50:25.188 --> 50:28.522
It's not foolish
to think you could sell your home.

50:28.813 --> 50:29.980
I think it's foolish.

50:30.313 --> 50:32.522
Don't be offended.
How much is it worth?

50:32.855 --> 50:35.147
Best case scenario, 120 million.

50:35.313 --> 50:37.397
But there are a lot of obstacles.

50:37.563 --> 50:39.105
- What obstacles?
- Lots.

50:39.272 --> 50:41.272
- Like what?
- Like the deed.

50:41.438 --> 50:43.730
My roommate, my debt.
Want more?

50:45.230 --> 50:46.563
It's a good time to buy.

50:46.730 --> 50:50.063
It's an investment
that will always retain its value.

50:50.355 --> 50:52.647
Prices keep shooting up.

50:53.313 --> 50:55.938
I examined
all your crummy suggestions

50:56.105 --> 50:59.397
before settling on the deal
I offered you tonight.

50:59.813 --> 51:02.480
You did not.
You've been daydreaming.

51:02.647 --> 51:03.855
What're you driving at?

51:04.272 --> 51:06.438
Don't count on my apartment.

51:06.730 --> 51:10.230
What if we help you
remove the obstacles?

51:11.522 --> 51:14.605
If you don't put this down
to me being stupid,

51:14.772 --> 51:19.022
I still harbor the tiny hope
of getting my wife back.

51:19.605 --> 51:20.688
Then what would I do?

51:20.855 --> 51:23.605
We'd rent you another place.

51:24.772 --> 51:27.438
I'd rather live in a slum

51:27.605 --> 51:29.105
than be a tenant.

51:29.438 --> 51:31.272
Didn't you forge my passport

51:31.438 --> 51:33.105
to go hang out in Thailand?

51:33.272 --> 51:35.022
You don't need your wife.

51:35.188 --> 51:38.105
He doesn't want to give it to us.
Leave him alone.

51:38.272 --> 51:40.855
Are you playing good guy again?

51:41.022 --> 51:44.022
We're a bunch of asses

51:44.188 --> 51:47.397
who never learned
not to meddle in people's lives.

51:51.022 --> 51:53.688
If you don't want to be a tenant,
sell this place,

51:53.855 --> 51:56.355
we can demolish the house
and build apartments.

51:56.813 --> 51:57.897
Parviz...

51:58.438 --> 52:01.563
the house is falling apart on all sides.

52:01.730 --> 52:03.938
We can't use it to build anything.

52:04.105 --> 52:07.605
We're in an urban decay area,
we don't pay taxes.

52:07.772 --> 52:10.522
We can build four stories,
with no elevator,

52:10.688 --> 52:13.022
and have a 590 sq. ft unit each.

52:13.188 --> 52:15.355
And with an elevator, Mr. Architect?

52:15.522 --> 52:19.188
With an elevator and standard staircase,
430 sq. ft each.

52:20.230 --> 52:22.022
Four units for the four of you.

52:22.188 --> 52:25.147
Just bury me and the parents
underneath it all.

52:25.313 --> 52:29.438
Know what? I'll live in the parking lot
with my kids, OK?

52:29.605 --> 52:30.772
Hold on...

52:32.022 --> 52:33.897
What if we take out a loan?

52:34.188 --> 52:36.147
We won't get one on the house.

52:36.313 --> 52:39.022
Get them out, please.
They're pissing me off.

52:39.188 --> 52:43.397
The walls could've collapsed.
We'd all be dead.

52:43.563 --> 52:46.355
Thank God,
you're here, fit as a fiddle

52:46.522 --> 52:48.147
in augmented reality

52:48.313 --> 52:50.022
right before my eyes.

52:50.522 --> 52:53.480
Now that you're so elegant,
can you eat?

52:53.647 --> 52:57.855
Elegance is fifteen people
all talking with their mouths full.

52:58.313 --> 53:02.647
How can you let your family
live in that house?

53:02.813 --> 53:07.313
You don't care about the family.
You just wanna be a homeowner.

53:07.480 --> 53:09.397
Can you build a house
with no money?

53:16.063 --> 53:18.813
If we have the money,
we might as well buy the shop.

53:19.147 --> 53:20.188
Finally.

53:20.355 --> 53:23.105
He sells his apartment,
we buy the shop...

53:23.272 --> 53:25.105
I got it. You're repeating yourself.

53:25.813 --> 53:26.980
Fine, I'll shut up.

53:27.355 --> 53:28.813
I'll think about it.

53:29.063 --> 53:33.605
If it's yes, I'll tell you.
If I say nothing, it's no.

53:34.855 --> 53:37.480
Don't eat that,
it's past the use-by date.

53:37.688 --> 53:39.855
It's still good to eat.

53:40.022 --> 53:43.355
You won't give us the apartment
or my passport?

53:44.522 --> 53:46.980
- I'm talking to you.
- Planning to use it?

53:47.605 --> 53:49.355
Did you hear him?

53:52.772 --> 53:54.730
Stop, give me that.

53:54.897 --> 53:56.647
The combination?

53:56.813 --> 53:58.397
I'll ask him.

54:00.147 --> 54:01.897
What the hell are you doing?

54:02.063 --> 54:03.605
Are you out of your mind?

54:03.980 --> 54:06.438
- He'll give it back.
- What's he doing?

54:07.647 --> 54:10.855
If we don't get this dump,
he doesn't get my passport!

54:12.563 --> 54:13.980
What're you doing?

54:14.147 --> 54:16.188
Leave my attachÃ© case alone!

54:16.355 --> 54:17.980
Gimme that!

54:18.147 --> 54:19.897
What're you doing with my ID?

54:20.063 --> 54:21.647
It's not in there!

54:25.438 --> 54:27.605
I'll give it to you!

54:29.897 --> 54:32.313
You idiot! Let him give it to you!

54:33.105 --> 54:35.522
Gimme two seconds!

54:36.397 --> 54:37.938
Give me back my documents!

54:38.105 --> 54:41.147
Let him open it for you!

54:41.313 --> 54:42.563
Give it back!

54:42.730 --> 54:43.897
Stop it!

54:44.522 --> 54:46.188
Give it back, you big bully!

54:47.105 --> 54:48.772
Why're you smashing it?

54:50.772 --> 54:52.563
What're you doing?

54:53.313 --> 54:54.980
Don't do that!

55:04.480 --> 55:06.813
Does he eat them or sell them?

55:15.647 --> 55:18.022
Why'd he do that?

55:31.772 --> 55:33.980
Can you type this up?

55:34.730 --> 55:36.022
Quiet, she's coming.

55:36.938 --> 55:38.355
Sorry to keep you waiting.

55:39.022 --> 55:40.063
Hello.

55:40.522 --> 55:42.897
I presented your case to the board,

55:43.063 --> 55:46.980
using Ms. Jourablou's request

55:47.563 --> 55:50.438
in the hope of getting
the answer I wanted.

55:50.605 --> 55:51.813
In short,

55:51.980 --> 55:54.355
you need to put up 40% of the price

55:54.522 --> 55:57.772
and obtain a 4-year loan
to buy the shop.

55:58.647 --> 55:59.730
That gives us...

56:01.397 --> 56:04.897
Our deposit
would have to be 176 million.

56:07.022 --> 56:09.147
Mr. Elias
will see the details with you.

56:09.480 --> 56:11.022
When is the delivery date?

56:11.397 --> 56:12.897
In 7 months.

56:13.063 --> 56:14.480
Construction starts in 3.

56:17.230 --> 56:18.980
Are your documents in order?

56:19.355 --> 56:22.647
No, we need some time to...

56:22.813 --> 56:23.897
It won't take long.

56:24.230 --> 56:25.855
Can we have a few days?

56:27.730 --> 56:29.980
You handle it, Ms. Jourablou.

56:30.605 --> 56:31.605
Thank you very much.

56:31.730 --> 56:32.980
You're welcome.

56:33.647 --> 56:34.647
Thank you very much.

56:34.772 --> 56:35.772
Bye.

56:36.272 --> 56:37.272
Thanks.

56:38.480 --> 56:39.647
You're welcome.

56:50.188 --> 56:53.230
Have a look around,
see if you like it.

56:53.397 --> 56:56.313
I'm going to walk around, too.

57:16.563 --> 57:19.188
Come look at the fancy shops.

57:36.980 --> 57:40.522
Without a loan,
we'll never get anywhere.

57:40.688 --> 57:42.522
Pitch in your apartment.

57:42.938 --> 57:44.272
Farhad, come here.

57:45.480 --> 57:49.772
Give my apartment a rest.
It wouldn't solve your problem.

57:50.563 --> 57:53.438
- We did the numbers.
- Yeah, but there's a hitch.

57:53.605 --> 57:56.313
I can only get 50,000 for my place.

57:56.813 --> 58:00.772
By pooling our money,
we only have 100, and we need 180.

58:02.355 --> 58:03.605
What's the hitch?

58:03.772 --> 58:05.897
I have debts, nothing serious.

58:08.647 --> 58:11.772
What's wrong? You don't look well.

58:21.938 --> 58:24.897
Mehrnaz took a third of the apartment
for alimony.

58:28.313 --> 58:30.855
- For alimony?
- Yes.

58:32.938 --> 58:35.147
You divorced?

58:37.022 --> 58:39.230
Two months ago.

58:42.647 --> 58:43.647
Here.

58:43.980 --> 58:45.647
All done?

58:46.855 --> 58:48.688
I'm gonna gobble you up.

58:49.480 --> 58:51.438
- Parviz?
- Yes.

58:53.897 --> 58:55.397
How are you?

58:56.355 --> 58:57.772
Good to see you.

58:58.313 --> 59:00.063
How are things?

59:00.230 --> 59:01.647
Hello, young ladies.

59:01.813 --> 59:04.397
Look how beautiful they are.

59:04.436 --> 59:05.490
You OK?

59:05.522 --> 59:07.355
Sorry, went down the wrong way.

59:07.522 --> 59:09.188
You never stop by.

59:09.355 --> 59:10.897
I'm busy, as you see.

59:11.063 --> 59:13.355
God be with you.
Is your father home?

59:13.522 --> 59:14.647
My father?

59:14.938 --> 59:16.230
You want to see him?

59:16.855 --> 59:18.938
He must be home.

59:46.063 --> 59:47.313
Put them here.

59:48.605 --> 59:50.480
You should come inside, Esmail.

59:50.647 --> 59:51.855
We'll be outside.

59:52.397 --> 59:54.563
- Is the barbecue ready?
- Yes.

59:54.897 --> 59:56.105
Jafar...

59:56.272 --> 59:57.980
- Brew some tea.
- Alright.

59:58.772 --> 01:00:02.730
Get everyone out,
we need some time alone.

01:00:02.897 --> 01:00:04.105
Will do.

01:00:06.772 --> 01:00:10.022
Ehsan, sister, go on.
I'll finish up.

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:14.813
Why does your family
keep saying we hooked you on opium?

01:00:15.105 --> 01:00:19.147
It's jealousy.
We get along, so people talk.

01:00:19.605 --> 01:00:23.313
Not one of your sons
came to Gholam's memorial.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.688
I'm sorry.

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:26.772
That's all you can say.

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:28.522
Jafar, bring the card.

01:00:29.813 --> 01:00:30.980
Listen, Cousin...

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:37.813
A lot of people would love
to be named patriarch of the family.

01:00:38.938 --> 01:00:41.688
At my son's wedding,
Gholam's only grandson,

01:00:41.855 --> 01:00:43.480
we'll officially name a successor.

01:00:44.063 --> 01:00:45.813
Who would you choose?

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:47.272
Ghardashali, of course.

01:00:47.855 --> 01:00:49.230
He's a gambler.

01:00:49.397 --> 01:00:52.647
His bad reputation
ultimately rubbed off on my father.

01:00:53.188 --> 01:00:55.105
True, but we have no choice.

01:00:55.438 --> 01:00:59.272
In his will, my father named you.

01:01:00.522 --> 01:01:01.563
Me?

01:01:02.313 --> 01:01:03.522
Why?

01:01:04.022 --> 01:01:07.147
You're the eldest
and you've always been loyal.

01:01:07.313 --> 01:01:08.897
That lot you gave him,

01:01:09.063 --> 01:01:10.772
he talked about it all the time.

01:01:10.938 --> 01:01:12.355
It was my duty.

01:01:12.813 --> 01:01:15.438
Which is why
you deserve to be patriarch.

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:17.188
Everyone will kowtow to you.

01:01:18.272 --> 01:01:20.063
I mean no disrespect,

01:01:20.397 --> 01:01:23.188
but do you have the shoulders
to sit in Gholam's place?

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:25.147
I assure you I don't.

01:01:25.813 --> 01:01:26.980
You'll have to.

01:01:29.355 --> 01:01:30.813
Give me a straight answer:

01:01:31.147 --> 01:01:32.272
yes or no?

01:01:32.813 --> 01:01:34.313
Yes, of course.

01:01:35.772 --> 01:01:36.813
You feel up to it?

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:40.272
I'm no great like you,
but I can emulate you.

01:01:40.438 --> 01:01:42.730
At the wedding,
you'll give the biggest gift.

01:01:43.188 --> 01:01:44.772
Do you have the means?

01:01:44.938 --> 01:01:46.772
I would do anything for you.

01:01:47.063 --> 01:01:48.897
You know the rules?

01:01:49.063 --> 01:01:52.022
The gift can only be cash or...

01:01:52.355 --> 01:01:53.980
Gold coins.

01:01:54.147 --> 01:01:55.272
Do you have the money?

01:01:55.688 --> 01:01:57.522
- I'll find it.
- No.

01:01:57.688 --> 01:01:59.855
You have it or you'll find it?

01:02:00.355 --> 01:02:01.355
I have it.

01:02:01.688 --> 01:02:03.855
You have to sign before a notary.

01:02:04.105 --> 01:02:05.480
With pleasure.

01:02:05.647 --> 01:02:07.522
I'm counting on that money.

01:02:07.688 --> 01:02:09.813
If you don't have it,
I'll ask someone else.

01:02:10.147 --> 01:02:12.355
On my Gholam's life I have it.

01:02:12.688 --> 01:02:13.688
Your Gholam?

01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:15.772
Parviz just had a boy.

01:02:15.938 --> 01:02:18.355
We named him Gholam
in honor of your father.

01:02:21.522 --> 01:02:23.105
I've always said it,

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:26.313
you're the most decent man
in this family.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.563
Here,

01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:30.355
the list of gifts patriarchs have given

01:02:30.522 --> 01:02:32.022
over the past 20 years.

01:02:32.188 --> 01:02:35.980
It goes up with each new wedding.

01:02:36.272 --> 01:02:41.438
I don't know what I've done
to deserve such an honor.

01:02:42.813 --> 01:02:44.022
You deserve it, Cousin.

01:02:45.605 --> 01:02:46.813
You deserve it.

01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:52.938
I should be kissing
the ground you walk on.

01:03:00.022 --> 01:03:02.897
Why repeat
what your shrew of a daughter says?

01:03:03.063 --> 01:03:05.313
How can you become patriarch?

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.647
With the money she confiscated.

01:03:07.673 --> 01:03:08.706
How much is that?

01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:10.938
Enough to become patriarch.

01:03:11.105 --> 01:03:14.022
You had the foresight to save up?

01:03:14.313 --> 01:03:17.438
Wouldn't you like us
to be patriarch and matriarch?

01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:21.397
Have everyone stand up
when we walk in a room?

01:03:21.688 --> 01:03:25.272
Will I be treated with great pomp
at Bayram's son's wedding?

01:03:25.438 --> 01:03:26.730
Of course!

01:03:26.897 --> 01:03:30.813
The day of the wedding,
they'll deliver our outfits.

01:03:31.647 --> 01:03:34.313
You'll be sitting next to the bride,

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.688
and I'll sit next to the groom.

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:40.480
The bride will ask for your permission
to say "I do."

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.563
What if she doesn't and humiliates me?

01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:45.522
She can't, it's the law.

01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:49.147
I can't see those people
treating us that well.

01:03:49.605 --> 01:03:51.272
That's nothing.

01:03:51.438 --> 01:03:56.188
When I die, the announcement will read:
"Patriarch of the Jourablou Clan."

01:03:56.813 --> 01:03:59.605
And for you, it'll read,

01:03:59.772 --> 01:04:02.355
"Wife of the Patriarch
of the Jourablou Clan."

01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:05.355
They didn't even use to say hello.

01:04:05.522 --> 01:04:07.897
Why would they make you this offer?

01:04:08.438 --> 01:04:10.480
First of all, I'm the eldest.

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:12.522
Second of all,
it was in Gholam's will.

01:04:12.855 --> 01:04:14.772
He named you in his will?

01:04:14.938 --> 01:04:16.813
I'm telling you!

01:04:17.105 --> 01:04:20.438
Teach your children
to respect the family.

01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:25.522
You know what will change for us,
if I become patriarch.

01:04:25.897 --> 01:04:29.688
And what it'll change for the others!

01:04:33.438 --> 01:04:34.438
Farhad...

01:04:36.688 --> 01:04:37.688
What?

01:04:38.313 --> 01:04:42.605
Dad's decided to impress Bayram
at his son's wedding.

01:04:42.772 --> 01:04:46.230
Promising. Just what we needed!

01:04:51.772 --> 01:04:54.522
What're you and your husband
up to again?

01:04:54.688 --> 01:04:57.688
- Isn't my husband your father?
- That's for you to say.

01:04:57.855 --> 01:04:58.855
Dad, what's up?

01:04:59.605 --> 01:05:03.980
We're invited to the wedding.
I'm being named patriarch.

01:05:05.938 --> 01:05:07.647
We're screwed. He's loving this.

01:05:07.813 --> 01:05:10.272
Don't you like being respected?

01:05:10.438 --> 01:05:12.063
Nobody dislikes it.

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:14.772
But isn't this sudden respect
suspicious?

01:05:15.188 --> 01:05:19.230
Do you know Gholam
paid the mortgage on this house?

01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:25.480
How can you tell such huge lies
to your own detriment?

01:05:25.647 --> 01:05:28.522
The more they disdain you,
the more you idolize them.

01:05:28.897 --> 01:05:30.647
What have they ever done for you?

01:05:30.813 --> 01:05:34.355
They made a junky of you at 70
to steal your inheritance!

01:05:34.522 --> 01:05:35.980
Don't be ridiculous.

01:05:36.147 --> 01:05:38.188
For two acres of arid land...

01:05:38.355 --> 01:05:41.230
That're worth 100 million today!

01:05:41.397 --> 01:05:47.105
Gholam and Bayram
spent ten times more on me by the sea.

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.897
You want to talk me out of it?

01:05:50.855 --> 01:05:52.897
What kind of a phone call was that?

01:05:53.063 --> 01:05:55.605
I'm going out of my mind.

01:05:55.772 --> 01:05:57.688
Dad's invited to the wedding

01:05:57.855 --> 01:06:00.730
as patriarch,
so he's giving the first gift,

01:06:00.897 --> 01:06:02.563
the most expensive one.

01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:05.980
- He can just give a small one.
- He can't.

01:06:06.147 --> 01:06:10.063
The patriarch's gift
has to be the biggest.

01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:14.188
If he gives a small one,
the others will be tiny.

01:06:14.647 --> 01:06:16.647
Think of the hosts.

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:17.800
Alireza,

01:06:17.813 --> 01:06:19.563
when I got married,

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:21.272
I was humiliated

01:06:21.438 --> 01:06:23.480
by those asshole cousins of his.

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:24.980
Shame on you.

01:06:26.813 --> 01:06:29.355
What about the coins Gholam gave you?

01:06:29.522 --> 01:06:32.105
How can you say that in front of us?

01:06:32.272 --> 01:06:34.813
Gholam didn't even want to come
to his wedding!

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:38.022
Dad had to buy 5 coins on credit.

01:06:38.188 --> 01:06:41.730
Gholam deigned to come gift them
as if he were generous.

01:06:42.063 --> 01:06:46.188
That wedding
was the worst night of my life!

01:06:46.355 --> 01:06:49.563
We expected 300 guests,
there weren't 50.

01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:52.813
At 1 a.m., people were leaving
and I was still hoping

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:55.105
your relatives would show up.

01:06:55.272 --> 01:06:58.522
I have a list of the gifts exchanged
these past 20 years.

01:06:58.688 --> 01:07:01.397
This notebook
holds proof of their ploys.

01:07:01.563 --> 01:07:03.688
How much was Gholam's last gift?

01:07:03.855 --> 01:07:06.105
For his granddaughter, 30.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:09.272
This time, Bayram,
the groom's father, is giving 35.

01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:11.647
So they expect Dad to pay 40!

01:07:11.813 --> 01:07:13.188
40 what?

01:07:13.355 --> 01:07:14.813
40 gold coins?

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:18.438
Everything's bogus,
the bride's name, the gifts...

01:07:18.605 --> 01:07:20.605
Why should we give them real gold?

01:07:20.772 --> 01:07:23.397
You're losing your marbles.

01:07:23.563 --> 01:07:26.105
There were one or two missteps.

01:07:26.397 --> 01:07:29.397
Bayram doesn't have enough
to throw a wedding.

01:07:29.563 --> 01:07:30.938
That's why he's come to you.

01:07:31.438 --> 01:07:34.605
He came out of respect
for our traditions.

01:07:34.772 --> 01:07:37.980
I am both the eldest
and the chosen one.

01:07:38.147 --> 01:07:39.272
Stop bothering me.

01:07:39.438 --> 01:07:41.688
Dig your head out of the sand.

01:07:41.855 --> 01:07:45.772
You know the first gift's a set up.

01:07:45.938 --> 01:07:48.438
No millionaire gives as big a gift

01:07:48.605 --> 01:07:50.105
as our dirt-poor patriarch.

01:07:50.272 --> 01:07:51.354
Mom.

01:07:51.355 --> 01:07:54.147
How did he get you
to shut up about this?

01:07:54.438 --> 01:07:56.938
Her? She thinks she's a queen now.

01:07:57.105 --> 01:07:58.147
Tell me, my queen!

01:07:58.313 --> 01:08:02.397
Haven't you spent your life
talking behind his family's back?

01:08:02.563 --> 01:08:05.522
You've always wanted
to cut off all ties.

01:08:06.605 --> 01:08:09.188
They've changed, that's all!

01:08:09.563 --> 01:08:13.063
They've always benefited
from mistreating people.

01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:15.022
They'll never change!

01:08:15.188 --> 01:08:18.104
At every wedding,
Gholam would take a dozen coins,

01:08:18.272 --> 01:08:21.397
pocket 5
and give the rest as a gift.

01:08:21.563 --> 01:08:23.313
And everyone was happy to see him.

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:25.688
There!
He knows what he's saying!

01:08:25.854 --> 01:08:28.479
Ask them to lend you 40 coins

01:08:28.647 --> 01:08:32.272
and give them back
while passing for the highest bidder.

01:08:33.897 --> 01:08:35.188
What're you doing?

01:08:35.772 --> 01:08:37.479
Are you running away?

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:40.063
Don't be so hard. Think of his heart.

01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:41.479
Step aside.

01:08:41.647 --> 01:08:42.854
Alireza, son...

01:08:43.022 --> 01:08:44.188
Let them talk.

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:45.729
Can we have an answer?

01:08:45.897 --> 01:08:50.188
If they wanted to foot the bill,
they wouldn't have opened the door.

01:08:50.354 --> 01:08:51.938
You know and you're going?

01:08:52.104 --> 01:08:55.522
It won't work with Bayram,
but it will with future weddings.

01:08:56.188 --> 01:08:58.854
The rest of my life,
I'll pocket a percentage

01:08:59.022 --> 01:09:01.104
and give them the rest.

01:09:01.272 --> 01:09:04.063
Everyone knows it's a scam

01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:06.854
but they gladly take part in it?

01:09:07.022 --> 01:09:08.604
Yes, it's a cycle.

01:09:08.772 --> 01:09:11.479
They know they'll have their turn.

01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:12.729
It's always been.

01:09:12.897 --> 01:09:17.313
With all the weddings planned,
if Dad's smart, he'll make some dough.

01:09:17.897 --> 01:09:21.147
You're dumb enough
to think he's smart?

01:09:21.313 --> 01:09:24.438
Of course I'm smart.
I'm just as good as they are.

01:09:24.604 --> 01:09:27.229
I took the bus to work for 37 years.

01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:29.647
Proof you're not so smart.

01:09:29.813 --> 01:09:32.229
You slaved away your whole life.

01:09:32.397 --> 01:09:34.604
You were never a freeloader.

01:09:34.772 --> 01:09:38.229
Every time they show up in our lives,
they bring trouble.

01:09:38.397 --> 01:09:40.479
We can't give you the money.

01:09:40.647 --> 01:09:43.104
We're starting a business.

01:09:43.438 --> 01:09:46.647
- Whose money were you counting on?
- Mine!

01:09:46.813 --> 01:09:48.604
- What do you have?
- Gold coins!

01:09:48.772 --> 01:09:50.688
- How many?
- 40!

01:09:50.854 --> 01:09:52.022
You tell them!

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:56.313
He's delirious. It's withdrawal.
Go get your hit.

01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.938
What's he talking about, Leila?

01:09:58.563 --> 01:10:01.855
It's true.
That's why I called you.

01:10:02.022 --> 01:10:03.063
How many does he have?

01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:04.563
40.

01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:07.188
40 coins.

01:10:07.813 --> 01:10:09.730
Where'd you get them?

01:10:09.757 --> 01:10:10.830
I had them.

01:10:10.855 --> 01:10:13.480
You had 40 coins and we didn't know?

01:10:13.813 --> 01:10:15.522
You'd have taken them.

01:10:15.688 --> 01:10:16.730
Really?

01:10:17.022 --> 01:10:19.063
You've watched us struggle

01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:20.397
without saying anything?

01:10:20.563 --> 01:10:23.647
It was my nest egg, for a rainy day.

01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:25.813
Every day is a rainy day!

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:28.897
Leila, how much more
do we need for the shop?

01:10:29.063 --> 01:10:29.772
60 million.

01:10:29.938 --> 01:10:31.272
- Manouchehr?
- That's correct.

01:10:31.438 --> 01:10:33.063
Parviz, Farhad...

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:34.647
See, Dad?

01:10:34.813 --> 01:10:37.772
With your coins,
we could buy that shop.

01:10:38.147 --> 01:10:40.438
You all talk, but you don't listen!

01:10:40.605 --> 01:10:44.147
And that way, we'd all have jobs.

01:10:44.313 --> 01:10:47.438
All our problems would be solved.

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:51.897
We could start our own families.

01:10:52.063 --> 01:10:54.647
And you would be our patriarch.

01:10:54.813 --> 01:10:56.272
All with a single shop.

01:10:56.813 --> 01:10:58.397
These coins aren't for a shop.

01:10:58.563 --> 01:11:01.313
They're for a wedding
I'm the patriarch of.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.438
Dad...

01:11:02.605 --> 01:11:04.188
Leave me alone!

01:11:04.355 --> 01:11:06.688
If you're not happy, get out!

01:11:06.855 --> 01:11:08.772
- Excuse me?
- Give me that!

01:11:08.811 --> 01:11:09.818
What do I do?

01:11:09.855 --> 01:11:11.355
They're mine!
Don't ask him!

01:11:11.522 --> 01:11:13.022
Hand them over!

01:11:13.188 --> 01:11:15.688
Here. Do you hear yourself?

01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:18.355
Ghardashali would give anything
to be in my shoes.

01:11:18.382 --> 01:11:19.502
Because he's dumb!

01:11:19.522 --> 01:11:21.313
I'm dumber than he is!

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.938
Money comes and goes.

01:11:23.105 --> 01:11:25.313
Your dad dreams of being honored

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:28.022
for once in his life.

01:11:28.355 --> 01:11:29.438
Mom,

01:11:29.605 --> 01:11:32.980
your four sons are unemployed.

01:11:33.147 --> 01:11:35.980
They dream of having stable jobs.

01:11:36.007 --> 01:11:37.087
Dad,

01:11:37.147 --> 01:11:40.105
your sons have no money,

01:11:40.272 --> 01:11:41.563
no health insurance,

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:45.688
and no hope
of one day having a pension.

01:11:45.938 --> 01:11:47.355
Dad...

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:49.980
Dad.

01:11:50.688 --> 01:11:52.355
Look at me.

01:11:52.897 --> 01:11:54.355
Daddy dearest,

01:11:54.813 --> 01:11:57.105
you know what I'm afraid of?

01:11:57.272 --> 01:11:59.188
Don't take this badly.

01:12:00.230 --> 01:12:03.188
I'm afraid that,
if we give them 40 coins,

01:12:03.438 --> 01:12:07.647
they'll say the coins were theirs.

01:12:08.022 --> 01:12:10.897
Everyone will believe them.

01:12:11.813 --> 01:12:13.438
You know why?

01:12:13.938 --> 01:12:18.938
Because we don't look like we can give
40 coins or 50 million.

01:12:19.105 --> 01:12:21.855
We're just too poor.

01:12:22.813 --> 01:12:24.230
Really.

01:12:25.063 --> 01:12:27.022
He's right.

01:12:27.438 --> 01:12:32.397
We'd be better off
renting out our suits,

01:12:32.897 --> 01:12:37.147
than giving a gift that's so pricey
we'll be suspected and ridiculed.

01:12:37.313 --> 01:12:40.105
I don't want to argue with you.

01:12:40.272 --> 01:12:42.897
But they're leading you
up the garden path.

01:12:43.563 --> 01:12:45.063
That path is a street.

01:12:45.813 --> 01:12:47.188
An avenue.

01:12:47.355 --> 01:12:48.522
A boulevard,

01:12:49.105 --> 01:12:50.605
a royal boulevard.

01:13:02.063 --> 01:13:03.188
Oh, my goodness!

01:13:03.355 --> 01:13:04.522
Dad!

01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:06.522
Get him up.

01:13:06.772 --> 01:13:08.355
Alireza, Farhad...

01:13:08.522 --> 01:13:09.938
Calm down.

01:13:10.911 --> 01:13:11.938
Dad...

01:13:12.105 --> 01:13:13.730
Is he breathing?

01:13:14.313 --> 01:13:15.563
Daddy dearest.

01:13:16.730 --> 01:13:20.730
Wait over there.
The IV will be finished 30 minutes.

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:29.772
The IV will be finished in 30 minutes.

01:13:33.272 --> 01:13:36.147
Did you know Dad's never been
by the sea?

01:13:36.313 --> 01:13:38.647
He said he went with Gholam...

01:13:38.813 --> 01:13:40.855
A pack of lies.

01:13:41.022 --> 01:13:43.605
They never took him.

01:13:43.772 --> 01:13:47.730
When you can't feed your family,
you don't go on weekend getaways!

01:13:48.272 --> 01:13:52.147
He makes up memories
with his cousins

01:13:52.313 --> 01:13:54.063
to prove that they love him.

01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:57.313
For that bastard Bayram's wedding,

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:01.355
Dad dry-cleaned his suit
a month in advance.

01:14:01.522 --> 01:14:04.688
He checked the mail every day
for the invite.

01:14:04.855 --> 01:14:06.563
It never came.

01:14:06.730 --> 01:14:08.147
He never went.

01:14:08.313 --> 01:14:12.605
But he's shared a thousand memories
of that wedding.

01:14:13.272 --> 01:14:18.605
He even says I was there,
and uses me as a witness.

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:24.063
Being their guest of honor
means the world to him.

01:14:24.230 --> 01:14:26.438
So leave him alone.

01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:29.522
Let him do what he wants.

01:14:31.563 --> 01:14:35.897
He tried so hard to get their attention
that he got their pity.

01:14:36.063 --> 01:14:37.772
Not even.

01:14:37.938 --> 01:14:42.272
When that bastard Gholam was alive,
he wouldn't give him time of day.

01:14:42.438 --> 01:14:46.397
Now they expect us to believe
he named him in his will?

01:14:47.022 --> 01:14:49.688
I don't think there is a will.

01:14:49.855 --> 01:14:52.772
And if there is, it means

01:14:52.938 --> 01:14:56.522
we're letting a dead man
dictate our lives.

01:15:29.605 --> 01:15:31.688
What's gotten into you?

01:16:20.063 --> 01:16:21.813
What're you doing?

01:16:23.938 --> 01:16:26.188
The dishes can wait.

01:16:26.355 --> 01:16:28.855
I'm cleaning your father's piss.

01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:31.688
That's what you get
for sneaking a smoke.

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:35.980
Who're you talking to?

01:16:36.147 --> 01:16:38.230
Don't you mind
seeing your sister smoke?

01:16:39.063 --> 01:16:40.730
Didn't your brothers mind

01:16:40.897 --> 01:16:43.647
seeing you 6 months pregnant
at your wedding?

01:16:44.188 --> 01:16:46.897
Alireza,
aren't you going to scold that hussy?

01:16:47.272 --> 01:16:50.397
You're the one who was pregnant,
not her.

01:17:12.147 --> 01:17:15.230
I don't know what to do anymore.

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:16.563
Don't worry.

01:17:16.730 --> 01:17:20.730
Things can get worse than this here.
Then you forget.

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:31.563
For me?

01:17:31.688 --> 01:17:32.980
I don't smoke.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:33.987
Take it.

01:17:34.022 --> 01:17:37.022
Smoke rarely and quit when you can.

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:49.730
You alright?

01:17:51.522 --> 01:17:52.522
I'm OK.

01:17:52.772 --> 01:17:53.772
Are you sure?

01:17:54.272 --> 01:17:55.272
Yes.

01:17:55.397 --> 01:17:56.563
Are you lying?

01:17:56.855 --> 01:17:58.063
Yes.

01:18:01.397 --> 01:18:02.813
Don't worry.

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:06.480
Only when you hit rock bottom
do you learn how to get up.

01:18:09.438 --> 01:18:11.688
Good thing you don't smoke.

01:18:17.938 --> 01:18:19.605
You think Oshin's still alive?

01:18:20.438 --> 01:18:21.730
Wanna get in touch?

01:18:23.272 --> 01:18:24.938
If it wasn't for that TV show,

01:18:25.105 --> 01:18:28.688
we'd never have known
we had to endure our miserable lives.

01:18:29.105 --> 01:18:31.647
We don't endure them,
we improve them.

01:18:32.063 --> 01:18:36.022
Even Oshin, with her thrift store,
improved their lives.

01:18:36.272 --> 01:18:38.105
My brothers are a bunch of losers.

01:18:38.125 --> 01:18:39.132
Why?

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:41.063
Even a thrift store's too much to ask.

01:18:41.230 --> 01:18:42.438
True!

01:18:52.105 --> 01:18:55.938
I still don't understand
how we sank so low.

01:18:56.605 --> 01:19:00.313
It's not at all the future
I envisioned as a kid.

01:19:01.813 --> 01:19:07.105
I've learned that growing up
means slowly but surely

01:19:07.355 --> 01:19:10.938
giving up on what you want.

01:19:14.230 --> 01:19:17.438
Did you know that all the rich people
know each other?

01:19:17.605 --> 01:19:19.355
I see it at work.

01:19:19.522 --> 01:19:20.522
Why?

01:19:21.897 --> 01:19:23.397
There aren't many of them.

01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:28.105
Poor people don't know each other,
they recognize each other.

01:19:30.438 --> 01:19:32.522
I don't know. Maybe.

01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:37.938
You had a suitor who disappeared...

01:19:38.855 --> 01:19:40.813
- Majid.
- Yeah.

01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:42.647
Did you know he got divorced?

01:19:43.188 --> 01:19:44.605
So what?

01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:46.730
Do you still like him?

01:19:48.355 --> 01:19:50.397
I'd forgotten he existed.

01:19:50.563 --> 01:19:52.480
Thank God.

01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.062
Why?

01:19:54.063 --> 01:19:56.522
He just married his second wife.

01:19:58.147 --> 01:19:59.730
Third time's the charm.

01:19:59.897 --> 01:20:01.647
He'll come after me next.

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:04.105
Practice makes perfect.

01:20:07.105 --> 01:20:09.313
Why'd he disappear all of a sudden?

01:20:09.647 --> 01:20:12.605
Dad told him I had an illness.

01:20:13.355 --> 01:20:14.355
Who told you?

01:20:14.647 --> 01:20:15.647
Majid did.

01:20:15.772 --> 01:20:16.812
When?

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:18.272
After his divorce.

01:20:18.688 --> 01:20:19.897
You're still in touch?

01:20:20.063 --> 01:20:23.147
He called me once
to suggest we get together.

01:20:23.313 --> 01:20:24.313
I said no.

01:20:30.730 --> 01:20:32.938
Why would Dad say such a thing?

01:20:33.855 --> 01:20:36.438
He wanted me to marry
someone from his family.

01:20:36.605 --> 01:20:37.605
Did you want to?

01:20:37.855 --> 01:20:40.772
I never got a chance to give my opinion.

01:20:41.355 --> 01:20:42.522
What do you mean?

01:20:42.897 --> 01:20:48.563
Dad tried to charm them
into sending a suitor to marry me.

01:20:48.730 --> 01:20:51.188
None of them wanted me.

01:20:56.855 --> 01:20:59.605
What can I do
to help pull us out of this?

01:21:04.355 --> 01:21:05.522
Have a magic lantern?

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.938
Suppose I did.

01:21:09.813 --> 01:21:12.022
Give me a sister.

01:21:12.188 --> 01:21:15.855
An older one, that I can lean on.

01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:18.855
And?

01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:20.563
And...

01:21:21.397 --> 01:21:25.647
Take Manouchehr back to his school days,
when he was so smart.

01:21:26.777 --> 01:21:27.830
Is that all?

01:21:27.855 --> 01:21:31.397
Make us forget this period
with the wave of a magic wand.

01:21:31.772 --> 01:21:33.355
Me or the magic lantern?

01:21:33.730 --> 01:21:34.813
If only you could.

01:21:35.147 --> 01:21:37.147
If I could...

01:21:39.313 --> 01:21:42.355
I'd buy a shop for each of us.

01:21:43.772 --> 01:21:45.813
And I'd make Dad our patriarch.

01:21:46.188 --> 01:21:48.147
Luckily, your wishes can come true.

01:21:48.522 --> 01:21:49.522
How?

01:21:49.647 --> 01:21:53.147
We stop Dad from going to the wedding
and we buy the shop.

01:21:53.438 --> 01:21:55.230
Have you lost your mind?

01:21:55.897 --> 01:21:58.397
He just got out of the hospital.

01:21:58.563 --> 01:22:00.980
He passed out for real, this time.

01:22:01.147 --> 01:22:03.188
I don't believe it.

01:22:03.355 --> 01:22:06.438
You want him to give them the coins
at the wedding?

01:22:06.605 --> 01:22:09.480
I want nothing.
I'm saying they're his to give.

01:22:10.022 --> 01:22:13.147
It's either the wedding or the shop.

01:22:13.313 --> 01:22:15.397
It's his life or his death.

01:22:15.688 --> 01:22:19.730
Another fight like that one
and he's sure to have a heart attack.

01:22:19.897 --> 01:22:21.563
And you'll take care of him.

01:22:22.147 --> 01:22:23.313
Drop it, Leila.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.688
I can't drop it.
And you have no right to!

01:22:27.063 --> 01:22:29.647
I agree that it's a poor decision.

01:22:29.813 --> 01:22:32.855
But poor decision-making
is what he does.

01:22:33.188 --> 01:22:34.563
He's like a stubborn kid.

01:22:35.022 --> 01:22:37.188
That's all we have in this family.

01:22:37.355 --> 01:22:40.313
Even the old folks are stubborn kids.

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:41.897
If we pressure him, he'll die.

01:22:42.855 --> 01:22:44.188
Is that your final word?

01:22:44.355 --> 01:22:46.272
It was also my first.

01:22:46.897 --> 01:22:49.063
We're all free to do as we please.

01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:52.105
We're all responsible for our own lives.

01:22:52.272 --> 01:22:57.063
No one has the right to whine their way
into other people's lives.

01:22:57.230 --> 01:22:59.647
Are you saying that for me?

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:02.938
Am I whining for myself?

01:23:03.438 --> 01:23:05.022
I asked you to stay to help me.

01:23:05.438 --> 01:23:09.272
If I stick around,
you'll have to listen to me.

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:12.980
If you act like the others I'll leave.

01:23:26.230 --> 01:23:27.230
Mom!

01:23:27.397 --> 01:23:30.730
Heat up my lunch.
I've got a ride, I'm late.

01:23:45.105 --> 01:23:46.313
You were out Saturday.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.980
I was looking for work.

01:23:48.147 --> 01:23:50.480
You'll lose your benefits next time.

01:23:51.022 --> 01:23:52.147
Yes, sir.

01:23:52.313 --> 01:23:53.480
Let me see your ID.

01:24:00.772 --> 01:24:04.105
Ali! Careful not to fall again.

01:24:06.522 --> 01:24:09.272
Hurry up, Mommy. It's started.

01:24:10.897 --> 01:24:11.897
Come on!

01:24:16.105 --> 01:24:17.105
Hello.

01:24:53.897 --> 01:24:56.063
Dad, get outta there!

01:24:56.139 --> 01:24:57.159
What's that?

01:24:57.188 --> 01:24:59.147
Bayram sent it for Dad.

01:24:59.772 --> 01:25:01.688
There's no water again!

01:25:01.855 --> 01:25:06.355
Mom, Leila, shut off the water.
We're all waiting to use the shower.

01:25:06.522 --> 01:25:07.562
Alireza?

01:25:07.563 --> 01:25:09.980
Beautiful! Is that for me?

01:25:10.147 --> 01:25:11.229
It sure is.

01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:12.730
Classy.

01:25:12.897 --> 01:25:16.272
The shirt I promised you.
Super XL!

01:25:16.563 --> 01:25:18.980
Thanks very much, little brother!

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:21.813
These shoes go well with that suit.

01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:22.980
Thank you, Manouchehr.

01:25:23.147 --> 01:25:24.438
Don't mention it.

01:25:24.605 --> 01:25:26.730
These watches are fake,
but they work.

01:25:26.897 --> 01:25:29.688
- Here, Parviz. Take one.
- Thanks.

01:25:29.855 --> 01:25:32.563
Solid gold brothers!

01:25:32.730 --> 01:25:34.022
- Manou-junk?
- Yes.

01:25:34.188 --> 01:25:35.772
Can I take this?

01:25:36.355 --> 01:25:37.438
I've worn it once.

01:25:37.605 --> 01:25:39.230
I don't mind. I like it.

01:25:39.397 --> 01:25:40.479
Take it.

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:43.313
Parviz, I took out the insoles,
they should fit.

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.022
Thank you.

01:25:45.855 --> 01:25:48.647
Look at that peachy complexion!

01:25:48.813 --> 01:25:50.855
Peach or tomato?

01:25:51.022 --> 01:25:56.397
Neither peach nor tomato.
That's my little duckling.

01:25:56.563 --> 01:25:59.105
I'm going to eat that little duckling.

01:25:59.272 --> 01:26:01.105
You're handsome, Daddy dearest.

01:26:01.272 --> 01:26:03.522
A true newlywed.

01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.480
If you say so.

01:26:05.647 --> 01:26:08.563
I hope that this year,
we can all go together

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:10.730
to the beautiful beaches in Pattaya.

01:26:10.897 --> 01:26:12.938
I'm counting on you.

01:26:13.105 --> 01:26:16.147
- Got the coins from Leila?
- She's gift-wrapping the box.

01:26:16.313 --> 01:26:18.897
Make sure she wraps it beautifully.

01:26:19.063 --> 01:26:19.813
She will.

01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:22.480
Dad, Bayram sent you this.

01:26:22.647 --> 01:26:23.730
Fantastic.

01:26:23.897 --> 01:26:26.188
Alireza, can I go next?

01:26:26.355 --> 01:26:28.063
Yeah, don't take 3 hours.

01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:29.076
I'll make it quick.

01:26:29.105 --> 01:26:31.980
A suit paid for by Bayram

01:26:32.147 --> 01:26:34.522
is something else.

01:27:06.605 --> 01:27:10.147
Look how handsome they are!
May God keep you.

01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:11.897
Pray.

01:27:12.063 --> 01:27:14.647
Stop it, Mom. That's Parviz's meal.

01:27:20.230 --> 01:27:22.105
Let me take your picture.

01:27:22.272 --> 01:27:23.980
Mom, go stand next to him.

01:27:24.147 --> 01:27:26.063
Manouchehr, next to Alireza.

01:27:26.230 --> 01:27:28.147
Farhad, on this side. You're taller.

01:27:28.166 --> 01:27:29.219
Careful.

01:27:29.230 --> 01:27:31.230
I am. Line up.
Parviz, step forward.

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:34.563
Come on, line up properly.

01:27:34.730 --> 01:27:36.230
I am being careful.

01:27:36.397 --> 01:27:37.437
Now.

01:27:37.438 --> 01:27:38.438
Look at me.

01:27:38.605 --> 01:27:39.605
Very nice.

01:27:39.730 --> 01:27:40.730
More to the left.

01:27:42.855 --> 01:27:44.855
I don't want the bathroom door.

01:27:45.230 --> 01:27:46.312
More...

01:27:46.313 --> 01:27:47.355
Good.

01:27:47.730 --> 01:27:49.355
One... Smile.

01:27:50.022 --> 01:27:51.272
Two...

01:27:51.813 --> 01:27:54.980
My sweethearts, you're gorgeous.

01:27:56.355 --> 01:27:57.355
Three.

01:27:59.772 --> 01:28:00.772
All done?

01:28:02.897 --> 01:28:03.937
Leila,

01:28:03.938 --> 01:28:06.980
Dad's all dressed up.
Take a picture of him alone.

01:28:07.563 --> 01:28:09.022
Take one of us two first.

01:28:09.813 --> 01:28:12.188
Parviz, out of the way.
I want him alone.

01:28:12.355 --> 01:28:13.980
Why? They look nice together.

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.397
He doesn't have a nice portrait.

01:28:16.563 --> 01:28:18.105
Contradicting me again?

01:28:18.272 --> 01:28:20.522
What do you want a portrait for?

01:28:20.688 --> 01:28:21.688
Go on then.

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:25.980
We never know what might happen.

01:28:27.022 --> 01:28:28.355
It's for his funeral.

01:28:28.522 --> 01:28:31.438
Dad, come stand over here.

01:28:32.522 --> 01:28:34.022
Farhad, sit to pee!

01:28:34.355 --> 01:28:36.397
Don't, it's a bad omen.

01:28:36.915 --> 01:28:37.962
Don't take it.

01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:40.772
Death comes when it's ready.
Take one of me, too.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:42.647
Give us a break.

01:28:42.813 --> 01:28:44.688
We can't use your picture.

01:28:44.855 --> 01:28:46.480
We'll have to use a flower!
Move.

01:28:48.647 --> 01:28:51.313
Leila, take it.
Tonight's photo is different.

01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:21.897
Dad, should I hold it for you?

01:29:22.355 --> 01:29:25.355
Give it to Bayram when it's gift time.

01:29:25.855 --> 01:29:26.897
OK.

01:29:29.563 --> 01:29:30.563
Alireza?

01:29:31.188 --> 01:29:32.188
Yes?

01:29:32.938 --> 01:29:37.730
Thank you. If it weren't for you,
the others wouldn't have let me go.

01:29:39.605 --> 01:29:41.813
Love you, Dad.

01:29:51.772 --> 01:29:53.980
Hello, congratulations.

01:29:54.522 --> 01:29:57.188
I wish them the best.

01:29:59.063 --> 01:30:01.355
Hello. How are you?

01:30:16.730 --> 01:30:20.313
Ladies, on the 2nd via the elevator.
Gentlemen, stairs to the 1st.

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.188
Hello. How are you?

01:30:22.355 --> 01:30:24.063
Hello, welcome!

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:27.397
What a pleasure to see you!

01:30:28.272 --> 01:30:30.397
Congratulations!

01:30:35.897 --> 01:30:39.813
<i>Welcome to this marvelous evening.</i>

01:30:40.105 --> 01:30:43.813
<i>I want to hear your applause!</i>

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:46.022
<i>Ladies up there, too!</i>

01:30:54.147 --> 01:30:58.230
<i>What an honor for me to name</i>

01:30:58.397 --> 01:31:02.230
<i>the late Gholam Jourablou's
successor tonight.</i>

01:31:02.730 --> 01:31:04.355
<i>Thank you!</i>

01:31:04.522 --> 01:31:07.272
<i>What a great atmosphere!</i>

01:31:14.938 --> 01:31:18.480
<i>Keep it up!
No slowing down now!</i>

01:31:18.647 --> 01:31:20.855
<i>We're in for a long night!</i>

01:31:22.397 --> 01:31:24.355
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:28.188
<i>What a night!</i>

01:31:28.647 --> 01:31:32.563
<i>And now the time has come
to name the patriarch.</i>

01:31:33.063 --> 01:31:37.438
<i>On this day, in this hour,
in this glorious second,</i>

01:31:38.313 --> 01:31:39.980
<i>the name of the patriarch</i>

01:31:40.147 --> 01:31:43.397
<i>of the family born
of the dynasty of the Jourablou clan,</i>

01:31:43.563 --> 01:31:46.272
<i>as wished by Gholam,</i>

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:50.105
<i>is now going to be officially announced.</i>

01:31:50.688 --> 01:31:53.397
<i>And the name is Mr...</i>

01:31:53.647 --> 01:31:56.563
<i>Esmail Jourablou!</i>

01:31:57.188 --> 01:32:01.772
<i>Bring the house down with your applause!</i>

01:32:02.147 --> 01:32:07.355
<i>I want to hear you
until the end of the night!</i>

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:11.772
<i>Again and again, make more noise!</i>

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:14.063
<i>Classy!</i>

01:32:21.855 --> 01:32:23.605
<i>Encourage him now!</i>

01:32:23.772 --> 01:32:27.105
<i>Until the end of the night!</i>

01:32:27.272 --> 01:32:31.480
<i>I want to hear
each and every one of you!</i>

01:32:31.855 --> 01:32:34.188
<i>Let's congratulate him!</i>

01:32:45.730 --> 01:32:48.188
<i>You're not whistling loud enough!</i>

01:33:21.605 --> 01:33:23.772
Congratulations, my boy.

01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:28.105
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

01:33:30.355 --> 01:33:31.522
<i>Music.</i>

01:33:31.688 --> 01:33:34.147
<i>One, two, three, four...</i>

01:34:23.605 --> 01:34:26.563
<i>As we wait for the band to tune up,</i>

01:34:26.730 --> 01:34:30.938
<i>it is a great honor for me</i>

01:34:31.105 --> 01:34:35.355
<i>to invite Mr. Jourablou and the groom</i>

01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:37.688
<i>out on the dance floor.</i>

01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:39.522
<i>Are you ready?</i>

01:34:40.272 --> 01:34:41.813
<i>Please.</i>

01:34:42.355 --> 01:34:44.230
<i>I can't hear you!</i>

01:34:45.938 --> 01:34:47.647
<i>Thank you!</i>

01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:52.188
<i>The family patriarch is fabulous!</i>

01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:56.480
<i>The band: One, two, three, four!</i>

01:38:35.813 --> 01:38:36.980
Leila!

01:38:56.813 --> 01:38:57.980
Stop!

01:39:02.688 --> 01:39:04.063
Leila, wait!

01:39:08.355 --> 01:39:09.480
Stop!

01:39:09.647 --> 01:39:12.522
Why're you doing this?
It's a lifetime of disgrace.

01:39:12.855 --> 01:39:14.230
My brothers are unemployed.

01:39:14.522 --> 01:39:16.397
Give me the coins.
You're scaring me.

01:39:16.563 --> 01:39:19.605
What're you afraid of?
Your brothers will be overjoyed.

01:39:19.897 --> 01:39:24.313
If they find out what you've done,
they'll kill you.

01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:26.980
I told you
to let Dad come to this wedding.

01:39:27.147 --> 01:39:28.897
He is at the wedding!

01:39:29.063 --> 01:39:30.563
This is worse than if he wasn't.

01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:32.897
I didn't want him to come.

01:39:33.063 --> 01:39:34.272
It's his money!

01:39:34.438 --> 01:39:35.647
It's his children's due!

01:39:35.813 --> 01:39:39.022
You're wasting your time.
I don't have the coins here!

01:39:39.230 --> 01:39:41.730
Stop being such a chicken.
Go back,

01:39:41.897 --> 01:39:44.438
get a grip
and set your brothers up for life.

01:39:44.605 --> 01:39:47.105
I won't go anywhere without the coins.

01:39:47.272 --> 01:39:50.688
Bayram just wants us
to pay for his son's wedding!

01:39:50.855 --> 01:39:54.313
That's what was planned.
It's none of our business.

01:39:54.813 --> 01:39:57.272
It's my business!
I won't give them to you.

01:39:57.438 --> 01:39:59.313
What am I going to say?

01:39:59.605 --> 01:40:03.272
Nothing. Go back, that's all.
They won't have a choice.

01:40:03.605 --> 01:40:06.772
Let's give them the coins
and take them back later.

01:40:07.188 --> 01:40:08.188
How?

01:40:08.355 --> 01:40:09.897
We'll beg them,

01:40:10.063 --> 01:40:12.938
threaten them, curse them,
you name it.

01:40:13.105 --> 01:40:15.980
They fear nothing
because they believe in nothing.

01:40:16.147 --> 01:40:18.605
Go! Don't make it worse
for our brothers.

01:40:18.772 --> 01:40:21.355
You want me to go
watch them be ridiculed?

01:40:21.522 --> 01:40:23.480
Dad is the patriarch now.

01:40:23.647 --> 01:40:25.230
Everyone has to obey him.

01:40:25.397 --> 01:40:30.022
Have him announce
that he's canceling the gift tradition.

01:40:30.188 --> 01:40:34.563
Dad cares about them more than us.
He would never ruin their wedding.

01:40:34.730 --> 01:40:35.812
Go back,

01:40:35.813 --> 01:40:38.022
look Bayram in the eye
and tell him

01:40:38.188 --> 01:40:40.313
to pay for our gift himself.

01:40:40.730 --> 01:40:41.772
What if he refuses?

01:40:41.938 --> 01:40:44.272
He'll be forced to deal with it.

01:40:44.438 --> 01:40:45.647
Don't be afraid.

01:40:45.813 --> 01:40:49.272
Be firm.
He'll eat out of your hand, you'll see.

01:40:51.647 --> 01:40:53.855
I can't! I'm coming with you.

01:40:54.355 --> 01:40:55.397
Go back!

01:41:21.272 --> 01:41:24.397
Any gift under 500,
round it up with this.

01:41:24.563 --> 01:41:27.063
- And double the coins.
- Yes, sir.

01:41:29.772 --> 01:41:31.397
- How much?
- Half a coin.

01:41:32.563 --> 01:41:34.605
One coin for Mr. Bapiri.

01:41:34.772 --> 01:41:35.772
Thank you.

01:41:35.897 --> 01:41:38.813
Give 500 to Hassan.

01:41:42.522 --> 01:41:44.313
- How're you?
- Why're you here?

01:41:45.230 --> 01:41:46.272
What's all this?

01:41:47.105 --> 01:41:49.022
Same as for any wedding.

01:41:49.438 --> 01:41:50.438
Meaning?

01:41:51.855 --> 01:41:54.813
We inflate the smaller gifts
to create hype.

01:41:55.647 --> 01:41:57.772
We need you to do it for us, as well.

01:41:58.438 --> 01:41:59.438
You're kidding?

01:41:59.813 --> 01:42:00.813
I'm not.

01:42:01.147 --> 01:42:03.397
Step out so we can talk.

01:42:17.022 --> 01:42:18.605
What's going on?

01:42:18.772 --> 01:42:20.772
You need to help us out.

01:42:21.022 --> 01:42:23.230
We invited you to help us out.

01:42:23.397 --> 01:42:24.897
- We don't have the coins.
- What?

01:42:25.063 --> 01:42:26.897
We need coins.

01:42:27.272 --> 01:42:28.355
You're kidding me?

01:42:28.522 --> 01:42:30.105
You give them coins.

01:42:30.272 --> 01:42:34.647
Not at all.
They give them back in the other room.

01:42:34.813 --> 01:42:36.813
Over here. I can't hear you.

01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:44.272
- Tell me.
- We don't have them.

01:42:44.438 --> 01:42:45.897
I just talked to your dad.

01:42:46.063 --> 01:42:48.355
- And?
- He said you had 40 coins.

01:42:48.522 --> 01:42:50.313
I swear I don't have a cent.

01:42:50.605 --> 01:42:52.647
This is not the time.
Let me count.

01:42:52.813 --> 01:42:54.438
I swear there are no coins.

01:42:54.772 --> 01:42:57.772
I insisted your dad accept
only if he could afford it.

01:42:57.938 --> 01:42:59.688
I didn't force him.

01:42:59.855 --> 01:43:01.730
No, you melted his heart.

01:43:06.272 --> 01:43:09.230
Give me 35.
I'll have them announce 40.

01:43:09.397 --> 01:43:12.438
Do us a favor,
give the entire amount in our name.

01:43:12.855 --> 01:43:13.937
Let me talk to him.

01:43:13.938 --> 01:43:16.480
My dad can't find out.
Help us.

01:43:16.647 --> 01:43:20.897
What about my reputation?
Your gift was paying for the venue.

01:43:21.063 --> 01:43:22.688
You could've gone elsewhere.

01:43:23.188 --> 01:43:25.980
And marry my only son
in a parking lot like you?

01:43:26.313 --> 01:43:28.105
What do you want to do?

01:43:28.272 --> 01:43:31.397
That's the way things stand.
There's no turning back.

01:43:31.563 --> 01:43:34.272
You idiot,
there's no turning back for you.

01:43:34.647 --> 01:43:37.647
You're marrying your son,
and my dad is the patriarch.

01:43:38.022 --> 01:43:40.230
Ghardashali is here with 50 coins.

01:43:40.605 --> 01:43:42.272
In his pocket?

01:43:42.438 --> 01:43:44.605
In his checkbook.
Know what that is?

01:43:44.772 --> 01:43:46.272
Ghardashali's pathetic.

01:43:46.438 --> 01:43:49.230
Less than you.
He's not ruining the wedding.

01:43:49.730 --> 01:43:51.688
My father is the patriarch.

01:43:51.855 --> 01:43:55.522
I can have him cancel
the wedding gifts.

01:43:56.147 --> 01:43:58.772
Are you threatening me?

01:43:59.313 --> 01:44:00.438
Suppose I am.

01:44:03.522 --> 01:44:07.397
When your father accepted,
he signed a contract

01:44:07.563 --> 01:44:09.147
saying he'd give 40 coins.

01:44:09.313 --> 01:44:13.438
I'll do you the favor
of not pressing charges.

01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:18.855
Now, keep a low profile, eat your dinner
and go back to your hovel.

01:44:19.022 --> 01:44:21.813
He's 80 and sick.
You can't do this to him.

01:44:22.147 --> 01:44:24.605
You whining little shit,

01:44:24.772 --> 01:44:28.480
threatening me when you think you can,
begging when you can't!

01:44:28.647 --> 01:44:31.105
Everything they say about you people
is true.

01:44:31.272 --> 01:44:34.355
You're a bunch of lazy, retarded bums!

01:44:34.772 --> 01:44:36.897
Don't ruin your son's wedding.

01:44:37.313 --> 01:44:40.063
Who wants to ruin my son's wedding?

01:44:40.230 --> 01:44:42.105
Esmail-the-beggar's son?

01:44:45.438 --> 01:44:49.188
My brothers
won't listen to you like I have.

01:44:49.522 --> 01:44:52.355
Go tell your brothers
to spoil the party.

01:44:52.522 --> 01:44:53.522
Do it!

01:44:55.188 --> 01:44:58.772
Cousin,
I've been begging you for an hour.

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:02.688
Shut your mouth.
Go tell them to ruin the party.

01:45:02.855 --> 01:45:05.022
Who were you counting on to spoil it?

01:45:05.397 --> 01:45:08.438
Your degenerate brothers
or your imbecile father?

01:45:09.230 --> 01:45:12.730
I can tie both my legs and an arm

01:45:12.897 --> 01:45:14.772
and still beat the four of you.

01:45:14.938 --> 01:45:17.730
Want me to kick your father
off that stage,

01:45:17.897 --> 01:45:19.980
make you get on all fours

01:45:20.147 --> 01:45:22.772
and sit Ghardashali on your backs?

01:45:22.938 --> 01:45:24.397
Want that?

01:45:27.688 --> 01:45:31.355
If any of you bat an eyelid tonight,

01:45:31.522 --> 01:45:34.688
I'll make mincemeat of you all

01:45:34.855 --> 01:45:37.688
and feed you to my son for his wedding.

01:46:04.522 --> 01:46:06.563
DJ! Switch it off!

01:47:55.022 --> 01:47:56.813
<i>The time has come</i>

01:47:56.980 --> 01:48:01.063
<i>to present the gifts,
but with a minor change.</i>

01:48:01.605 --> 01:48:03.522
<i>Luckily, nowadays,</i>

01:48:03.688 --> 01:48:06.522
<i>we can talk our differences through.</i>

01:48:08.522 --> 01:48:11.730
<i>Tonight,
at the request of our patriarch,</i>

01:48:11.897 --> 01:48:14.855
<i>Mr. Esmail Jourablou,</i>

01:48:15.230 --> 01:48:19.730
<i>the first gift will be presented
by Mr. Ghardashali Jourablou.</i>

01:48:20.980 --> 01:48:26.563
<i>Esmail, our guest of honor,
will keep us company with his sons.</i>

01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:28.855
<i>And now...</i>

01:48:29.313 --> 01:48:31.022
<i>let me present,</i>

01:48:31.397 --> 01:48:35.605
<i>on this day, at this hour,
in this glorious second,</i>

01:48:35.772 --> 01:48:37.730
<i>the family patriarch</i>

01:48:37.938 --> 01:48:41.188
<i>and successor
to the late Gholam Jourablou,</i>

01:48:41.355 --> 01:48:45.397
<i>Mr. Ghardashali Jourablou!</i>

01:49:41.938 --> 01:49:43.147
<i>I congratulate you</i>

01:49:43.313 --> 01:49:46.147
<i>for all the applause and energy.</i>

01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:51.897
<i>The first gift,</i>

01:49:52.063 --> 01:49:53.688
<i>offered by the family patriarch,</i>

01:49:53.855 --> 01:49:57.688
<i>Mr. Ghardashali Jourablou.</i>

01:49:57.855 --> 01:49:59.313
<i>70 million tomans.</i>

01:50:00.147 --> 01:50:03.855
<i>The equivalent of 50 gold coins.</i>

01:50:04.022 --> 01:50:07.105
<i>Blessed he be!</i>

01:50:07.272 --> 01:50:08.730
<i>Thank you!</i>

01:50:12.563 --> 01:50:14.313
<i>Well done!</i>

01:50:46.730 --> 01:50:49.772
Why are you locking the door?
Wait, Esmail.

01:50:49.938 --> 01:50:51.563
Don't lock the door.

01:50:51.730 --> 01:50:53.813
Come back, please.

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:56.855
I'll make you some nice tea.

01:50:57.022 --> 01:50:59.438
Take your opium, you'll feel better.

01:50:59.605 --> 01:51:01.105
Come here.

01:51:07.522 --> 01:51:10.897
In two days, the price of coins
has gone up by 200,000.

01:51:11.355 --> 01:51:13.272
- How much did you sell them?
- 1.4 million.

01:51:13.605 --> 01:51:14.855
What time do we get up?

01:51:15.022 --> 01:51:16.938
Leila, wake me up at 7.

01:51:17.105 --> 01:51:20.230
You were all in on it?

01:51:20.397 --> 01:51:24.563
Manouchehr's sleeping here
because he sold his apartment.

01:51:25.188 --> 01:51:29.188
Farhad sold his car,
and is picking up the money at 8 a.m.

01:51:29.355 --> 01:51:31.730
At 10, we're signing for the shop.

01:51:31.897 --> 01:51:35.188
Without telling me?
Why'd you drag me into this?

01:51:35.355 --> 01:51:38.022
Without you,
it wouldn't have worked.

01:51:38.438 --> 01:51:40.522
But you did it all yourselves.

01:51:40.688 --> 01:51:42.105
With your help.

01:51:42.438 --> 01:51:44.105
I got played.

01:51:44.272 --> 01:51:47.855
If I'd had a say,
you wouldn't have bought the shop.

01:51:48.355 --> 01:51:50.522
Alireza, you handled it perfectly.

01:51:50.688 --> 01:51:53.772
Hats off to you.
I would've had a heart attack.

01:51:53.938 --> 01:51:55.355
- Right?
- Yup.

01:51:55.522 --> 01:51:57.522
Why didn't you say anything?

01:51:57.813 --> 01:52:01.147
We did and you refused.
We didn't insist.

01:52:01.313 --> 01:52:04.647
What's troubling you?
You did a good job.

01:52:05.063 --> 01:52:06.480
What job?

01:52:06.647 --> 01:52:08.480
You think I'm an idiot?

01:52:08.647 --> 01:52:12.147
He's right.
You weren't supposed to be in on it.

01:52:12.313 --> 01:52:14.188
We did the thinking,
you performed.

01:52:14.355 --> 01:52:15.688
And you did good.

01:52:15.855 --> 01:52:18.022
You were thinking for me?

01:52:18.605 --> 01:52:20.438
You should tell us

01:52:20.605 --> 01:52:22.980
whose name
goes on the paperwork tomorrow.

01:52:23.147 --> 01:52:25.480
The deed
will be issued in that name.

01:52:26.105 --> 01:52:29.522
Dad's, of course,
so we can look him in the eye again.

01:52:29.688 --> 01:52:31.813
So he can sell the shop out of spite?

01:52:32.105 --> 01:52:33.938
Or give it to Bayram.

01:52:34.105 --> 01:52:35.897
Leila signs.

01:52:36.147 --> 01:52:37.522
"Leila & Bros." sounds nice.

01:52:37.897 --> 01:52:41.647
It's not my shop.
One of you has to sign.

01:52:41.813 --> 01:52:42.813
Like who?

01:52:43.132 --> 01:52:44.132
Take a vote.

01:52:44.147 --> 01:52:47.563
Farhad thinks with his pecs,

01:52:47.730 --> 01:52:49.105
so not him.

01:52:49.772 --> 01:52:54.772
Parviz is overweight
and might have a heart attack any time.

01:52:54.938 --> 01:52:55.979
Not him either.

01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:57.063
And you're a thief.

01:52:57.230 --> 01:52:58.980
You'll end up in jail.

01:52:59.272 --> 01:53:01.563
- So not me.
- That leaves Alireza.

01:53:01.938 --> 01:53:03.313
I vote for Alireza.

01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:05.105
Logical.

01:53:05.688 --> 01:53:06.688
Leila?

01:53:07.105 --> 01:53:08.188
I abstain.

01:53:08.355 --> 01:53:10.272
- Who do you vote for?
- I'm not saying.

01:53:10.438 --> 01:53:11.938
- You have to.
- And you?

01:53:12.105 --> 01:53:14.938
I won't vote.
But you're not voting for me, right?

01:53:15.105 --> 01:53:16.522
Not anymore.

01:53:16.688 --> 01:53:18.230
Why not?

01:53:19.313 --> 01:53:20.397
'Cause you're a coward.

01:53:20.897 --> 01:53:22.688
That's why you're shouting.

01:53:22.855 --> 01:53:24.938
We spare you
and you get excited.

01:53:25.647 --> 01:53:27.355
I made you stay

01:53:27.522 --> 01:53:30.063
to save you
from your shitty lives.

01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:32.022
But you just don't see it.

01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:35.938
Who got us into deep shit tonight?

01:53:36.313 --> 01:53:39.272
How dare you defend
your asshole father.

01:53:39.438 --> 01:53:42.105
Have you no shame?

01:53:42.272 --> 01:53:45.772
You humiliated that poor,
naive, old man so badly,

01:53:45.938 --> 01:53:50.022
till his death he won't forget
what he went through tonight.

01:53:50.188 --> 01:53:52.397
All you see is him?
What about them?

01:53:52.563 --> 01:53:57.480
Because of you
there's no affection left between them.

01:53:57.647 --> 01:53:59.855
They're forced to live together.

01:54:00.022 --> 01:54:01.397
That's not my doing.

01:54:01.563 --> 01:54:05.313
They're here. They know the parents
better than you do.

01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:09.730
They don't show up every 8 years
in a hurry to leave again.

01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:12.772
Mom and Dad may be senile now,

01:54:13.188 --> 01:54:15.647
but tonight, I saw it with my own eyes.

01:54:15.813 --> 01:54:19.522
I saw that you're behind
everyone's misfortune here.

01:54:51.855 --> 01:54:55.813
Sign all three pages of this copy,
as well.

01:55:02.563 --> 01:55:03.897
Congratulations.

01:55:04.063 --> 01:55:05.605
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:55:05.772 --> 01:55:08.897
Thank you for everything.

01:55:09.063 --> 01:55:10.605
This is your copy.

01:55:11.272 --> 01:55:13.147
Mr. Property Owner!

01:55:13.313 --> 01:55:14.355
Alireza...

01:55:14.772 --> 01:55:18.480
- Thank you, sir.
- Can you hand me an envelope?

01:55:20.708 --> 01:55:21.741
Here you go.

01:55:21.772 --> 01:55:23.647
Congratulations.

01:55:23.813 --> 01:55:24.813
Congratulations to you!

01:55:24.938 --> 01:55:26.855
See you tonight.

01:55:37.647 --> 01:55:38.772
'Evening.

01:55:43.438 --> 01:55:45.063
Already here?

01:55:45.813 --> 01:55:48.230
You should've waited a few days.

01:55:55.813 --> 01:55:57.813
He hasn't come out yet?

01:55:59.105 --> 01:56:00.230
Dad?

01:56:00.897 --> 01:56:03.313
Mom says he hasn't eaten
or taken his pills.

01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:05.772
Hasn't even gone to the bathroom.

01:56:06.647 --> 01:56:08.188
Maybe something's happened?

01:56:08.355 --> 01:56:10.438
No, I can hear his lighter.

01:56:10.938 --> 01:56:12.897
Thank you for this, Ali.

01:56:13.063 --> 01:56:15.272
Don't make things worse, Mom.

01:56:15.438 --> 01:56:16.605
Dad...

01:56:16.772 --> 01:56:19.772
What you did to your father last night,

01:56:19.938 --> 01:56:22.688
no one would do to their worst enemy.

01:56:22.855 --> 01:56:26.188
Soon, you won't know
how to thank us for last night.

01:56:27.063 --> 01:56:28.813
We didn't do anything wrong.

01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:32.147
We bought a shop
in one of the best malls of Tehran.

01:56:33.355 --> 01:56:36.480
Dad, it's the mall where I work.

01:56:36.647 --> 01:56:38.188
It's legit.

01:56:38.355 --> 01:56:41.688
We didn't buy it just with your coins.

01:56:41.855 --> 01:56:44.438
We pitched in everything we had.

01:56:44.605 --> 01:56:47.397
Come see it tomorrow.
If you don't like it...

01:56:48.022 --> 01:56:50.688
Stop talking nonsense.

01:56:50.855 --> 01:56:53.522
Whatever next? Go back inside.

01:56:53.688 --> 01:56:56.272
Parviz, he's fine. Go inside.

01:57:04.522 --> 01:57:06.688
Dad, don't listen to them.

01:57:06.855 --> 01:57:08.522
I'm the one who signed.

01:57:08.688 --> 01:57:10.063
I have the deed.

01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:15.272
Let's go tomorrow.
If you like it, it's yours.

01:57:16.063 --> 01:57:20.897
And if you don't like it,
I swear I'll cancel the sale.

01:57:21.397 --> 01:57:24.063
I'll buy back your coins
and give them to you.

01:57:25.063 --> 01:57:27.772
But first, come see the place.

01:57:30.605 --> 01:57:31.855
Dad?

01:57:43.938 --> 01:57:45.438
This way, Dad.

01:57:46.063 --> 01:57:48.022
Our shop will be here.

01:57:49.563 --> 01:57:51.147
Right here.

01:57:52.938 --> 01:57:54.063
Look.

01:57:55.522 --> 01:57:56.522
This is it.

01:58:08.688 --> 01:58:11.355
Wait, Dad. Let me explain.

01:58:11.522 --> 01:58:15.397
Buying this shop
is a very good decision.

01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:18.438
I'm telling you this,

01:58:18.605 --> 01:58:23.397
and I swear I wasn't in the know
at the wedding.

01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:26.563
Business is so good here,

01:58:26.730 --> 01:58:29.563
that they're replacing the toilets
with eight shops.

01:58:30.272 --> 01:58:32.522
We'll have the best one.

01:58:32.688 --> 01:58:34.938
Our shop will be 6.5 by 10 feet.

01:58:35.105 --> 01:58:37.563
The shopfront will be 10 feet wide.

01:58:37.855 --> 01:58:41.355
It'll start exactly here.

01:58:41.522 --> 01:58:45.563
One, two, three...
All the way to the back.

01:58:45.730 --> 01:58:47.147
All that...

01:58:47.730 --> 01:58:48.813
Sorry.

01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:53.147
And in this direction, 6.5 feet

01:58:53.313 --> 01:58:55.438
to the hallway we came in from.

01:58:55.605 --> 01:58:56.688
You saw it.

01:58:56.855 --> 01:59:01.438
Next to a couple of the best shops.
It's an excellent location.

01:59:01.605 --> 01:59:03.313
It's a popular spot.

01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:07.647
They gave it to us
because Leila and Parviz work here.

01:59:08.313 --> 01:59:12.688
Dad, try to forget what you're hearing
and seeing here today.

01:59:12.855 --> 01:59:16.063
In three months, you'll love it.

01:59:16.313 --> 01:59:20.313
Come spend a day with me, you'll see.

01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:21.563
Dad...

01:59:21.730 --> 01:59:24.688
The four of us will work hard.

01:59:24.855 --> 01:59:26.772
We're gonna make a buck.

01:59:28.230 --> 01:59:30.188
Much good may it do you.

01:59:31.105 --> 01:59:32.563
I'll see you in court.

01:59:33.272 --> 01:59:35.397
Why in court, Dad?

01:59:35.563 --> 01:59:39.147
Think of it as a buildable lot.

01:59:39.313 --> 01:59:42.563
Don't you trust my economic instinct?

01:59:42.730 --> 01:59:45.980
Didn't you save those coins
for your kids' future?

01:59:46.147 --> 01:59:47.355
The future is now.

01:59:47.522 --> 01:59:49.397
I don't want kids like you.

01:59:49.855 --> 01:59:52.647
Alireza, I trusted you.

01:59:52.813 --> 01:59:55.105
It was the worst mistake of my life.

01:59:56.647 --> 02:00:00.605
You removed my crown
to buy bathroom stalls?

02:00:01.063 --> 02:00:03.980
Give me my coins back right now!

02:00:04.147 --> 02:00:06.647
Leila works here. This is awkward.
Listen...

02:00:06.813 --> 02:00:07.855
I won't listen!

02:00:08.022 --> 02:00:09.897
I mortgaged the house.

02:00:10.063 --> 02:00:12.272
If I don't return them,
you'll all be homeless.

02:00:12.730 --> 02:00:13.813
A mortgage?

02:00:14.647 --> 02:00:17.647
I got a mortgage to buy the coins.

02:00:17.813 --> 02:00:19.563
You're humiliating me again.

02:00:19.730 --> 02:00:22.063
You shouldn't have had kids!

02:00:22.230 --> 02:00:24.897
And stop shouting, you old fool.
People are staring!

02:00:25.063 --> 02:00:26.063
Shut up!

02:00:27.105 --> 02:00:28.813
- I had you...
- Cool it.

02:00:30.022 --> 02:00:32.730
I fed and raised you.

02:00:32.897 --> 02:00:35.188
Now go fuck yourselves!

02:00:35.938 --> 02:00:38.897
Why should I support you
in your forties?

02:00:39.230 --> 02:00:42.022
- Why?
- Calm down.

02:00:43.563 --> 02:00:44.772
My gold coins.

02:00:45.563 --> 02:00:46.647
OK!

02:00:47.688 --> 02:00:49.772
He's going to pass out.

02:00:50.188 --> 02:00:51.271
Dad!

02:00:51.272 --> 02:00:52.313
He's passing out!

02:00:53.105 --> 02:00:54.480
Call an ambulance!

02:00:56.522 --> 02:00:58.188
Dad, I'm sorry.

02:01:00.313 --> 02:01:01.980
We need sugar.

02:01:02.730 --> 02:01:04.605
Call an ambulance.

02:01:04.897 --> 02:01:05.938
Some water, please.

02:01:09.605 --> 02:01:10.605
Dad!

02:01:18.188 --> 02:01:20.063
Talk!

02:01:20.230 --> 02:01:21.772
Gimme that!

02:01:29.730 --> 02:01:31.397
I'm exhausted.

02:01:33.063 --> 02:01:35.022
I can't do this anymore.

02:01:35.188 --> 02:01:37.480
I can't...

02:01:39.230 --> 02:01:41.480
Prices are rocketing.

02:01:41.938 --> 02:01:44.980
It could even get worse than this.

02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:47.605
Then before it gets out of hand,

02:01:47.772 --> 02:01:51.105
we should return the shop
and buy his coins back.

02:01:54.688 --> 02:01:57.397
You'll have to kill me

02:01:57.813 --> 02:01:59.397
to return that shop.

02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:05.480
Do you know
why he's panicking like this?

02:02:05.772 --> 02:02:09.813
He put a mortgage on the house
to buy the coins.

02:02:13.938 --> 02:02:14.938
Says who?

02:02:15.647 --> 02:02:16.813
Him.

02:02:18.605 --> 02:02:21.313
- He couldn't.
- He did.

02:02:21.855 --> 02:02:24.897
If he hadn't, he wouldn't be here.

02:02:49.772 --> 02:02:52.980
Leila didn't see the scene
he made at the mall.

02:02:53.147 --> 02:02:56.522
It was payback for being dethroned.

02:02:56.688 --> 02:02:58.938
Payback?
He's the one in the hospital.

02:02:59.105 --> 02:03:02.605
Leila's plan aside,

02:03:02.772 --> 02:03:06.147
I never would've thought
Bayram would do this to Dad.

02:03:06.313 --> 02:03:08.730
Me neither. It's hard to believe.

02:03:08.897 --> 02:03:11.813
Leila couldn't have guessed
he'd go so far.

02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:15.605
You think if Leila had known
Bayram would kick Dad off stage,

02:03:15.772 --> 02:03:17.980
she wouldn't have taken the coins?

02:03:18.855 --> 02:03:21.188
We return them
or we lose the house.

02:03:21.688 --> 02:03:24.272
We'll return them, of course.

02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:25.980
Thanks to the shop.

02:03:26.147 --> 02:03:28.272
We're going to lose him.

02:03:28.897 --> 02:03:32.105
If anything happens to him,
you won't see me again.

02:03:33.605 --> 02:03:34.855
Too bad.

02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:40.480
You think he'll surrender?
He'll resist until it kills him.

02:03:41.772 --> 02:03:42.897
Let him die.

02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:50.188
For once in his life,
he found money at the right time.

02:03:50.355 --> 02:03:53.313
And instead of letting Bayram
extort him,

02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:55.897
we put it to good use.

02:03:56.063 --> 02:03:58.855
You call your dirty tricks good use?

02:03:59.022 --> 02:04:00.605
Pretend we got a loan.

02:04:00.772 --> 02:04:02.272
He's going to die.

02:04:03.063 --> 02:04:04.438
He lost face.

02:04:04.605 --> 02:04:07.063
His house is at stake.
He can't breathe.

02:04:07.355 --> 02:04:08.855
Imagine he'd given it to Bayram.

02:04:09.147 --> 02:04:11.147
He wouldn't be in intensive care.

02:04:11.438 --> 02:04:13.438
And we wouldn't have a shop.

02:04:13.772 --> 02:04:16.313
Dad cursed that shop.

02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:19.022
It'll never turn a profit.

02:04:19.188 --> 02:04:20.188
Parviz?

02:04:20.355 --> 02:04:23.105
I've been this guy's son for 50 years.

02:04:23.272 --> 02:04:25.022
Half a century.

02:04:25.188 --> 02:04:27.647
When he digs in his heels,

02:04:27.813 --> 02:04:30.730
he goes all the way.

02:04:30.897 --> 02:04:32.313
Alireza's right.

02:04:32.772 --> 02:04:35.980
He won't let up until he drops dead.

02:04:36.438 --> 02:04:38.438
By the time
the shop's up and running,

02:04:38.605 --> 02:04:41.897
we'll have lost our house
and everything.

02:04:43.230 --> 02:04:45.355
At what cost
will we start a business?

02:04:46.063 --> 02:04:49.188
There's a huge waiting list
for that shop.

02:04:49.355 --> 02:04:51.772
At what cost
will we lose this opportunity?

02:04:51.938 --> 02:04:54.272
At the cost of our roof.

02:04:55.938 --> 02:04:58.980
At the cost of our father's life.

02:04:59.147 --> 02:05:01.855
But to you, that's worth nothing.

02:05:03.647 --> 02:05:04.813
Manouchehr.

02:05:09.105 --> 02:05:10.313
Nothing to add?

02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:12.897
Nothing you'll like hearing.

02:05:14.813 --> 02:05:16.605
Doesn't matter. Say it anyway.

02:05:16.772 --> 02:05:20.772
For the shop to turn a profit,
we'll need time and capital.

02:05:20.938 --> 02:05:22.188
We have neither.

02:05:22.355 --> 02:05:26.772
That shop is a good investment,
even if it stays closed.

02:05:26.938 --> 02:05:31.438
Even if we were to lose the house,
which we won't.

02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:36.355
If he'd given the coins to Bayram,
how would he have returned them?

02:05:36.522 --> 02:05:37.522
We'll do the same.

02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:42.980
He didn't think about
how he'd pay them back.

02:05:43.147 --> 02:05:46.355
He just wanted to be
up on that stage.

02:05:46.522 --> 02:05:49.105
We're capable of anything
in this family.

02:05:49.272 --> 02:05:51.855
If we lose the house,
we'll be homeless.

02:05:52.105 --> 02:05:54.855
The potential of that shop
is beyond compare.

02:05:55.022 --> 02:05:57.897
With it,
all of you will become homeowners.

02:05:58.063 --> 02:05:59.980
We're doing this for us.

02:06:00.147 --> 02:06:02.147
We also invested our money.

02:06:02.313 --> 02:06:05.022
So our opinion should count, too.

02:06:05.188 --> 02:06:06.188
Let's take a vote.

02:06:06.563 --> 02:06:08.022
A vote?

02:06:11.522 --> 02:06:12.563
Alireza...

02:06:13.688 --> 02:06:17.855
have you brainwashed them
into returning the shop?

02:06:20.022 --> 02:06:23.188
Will you accept the consequences
or share the blame?

02:06:45.563 --> 02:06:48.813
You'll remember this night
for the rest of your lives.

02:06:51.438 --> 02:06:54.647
You'll regret
making this absurd decision

02:06:54.813 --> 02:06:57.063
and not listening to me.

02:06:57.522 --> 02:07:01.688
You are ruining
the biggest opportunity of your lives.

02:07:02.397 --> 02:07:06.063
You're sentencing yourselves
to eternal poverty, here and now.

02:07:52.605 --> 02:07:54.230
Are you sure?

02:07:56.938 --> 02:07:58.188
Cancel it.

02:08:11.397 --> 02:08:12.897
Hello.

02:08:13.063 --> 02:08:14.813
I'd like 40 gold coins.

02:08:15.188 --> 02:08:16.188
2.5 million each.

02:08:16.313 --> 02:08:19.730
You mean 1.5 million?
We just sold them for 1.4.

02:08:19.897 --> 02:08:21.355
No, man. It's 2.5 now.

02:08:22.605 --> 02:08:23.647
But why?

02:08:23.813 --> 02:08:27.397
The US wants to abandon
the nuclear deal. Excuse me.

02:08:27.563 --> 02:08:29.522
They want to. They haven't yet.

02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:31.021
We'll see.

02:08:31.022 --> 02:08:32.438
Can you buzz us out?

02:08:32.605 --> 02:08:33.855
They won't do it.

02:08:34.272 --> 02:08:35.480
Hello.

02:08:36.897 --> 02:08:38.063
We want 40 coins.

02:08:38.355 --> 02:08:41.188
3 million each.
That makes 120 million.

02:08:42.438 --> 02:08:45.355
It was 100 million across the street.
2.5 each.

02:08:45.730 --> 02:08:47.772
Tomorrow, it'll be 150.

02:08:47.938 --> 02:08:50.105
Can I ask you a question?

02:08:50.272 --> 02:08:52.647
For 40 coins, should we wait or buy?

02:08:52.813 --> 02:08:56.188
- Wait. Prices might come down.
- Will they?

02:08:59.313 --> 02:09:01.480
We came earlier.

02:09:01.855 --> 02:09:04.355
For 40 coins
can you give us a discount?

02:09:04.688 --> 02:09:07.063
The site was just updated.
It's now 3 million.

02:09:09.980 --> 02:09:12.188
But we were just here.

02:09:12.355 --> 02:09:13.355
What can I say?

02:09:21.813 --> 02:09:26.355
Right now, on line,
40 coins are going for 200 million.

02:09:26.522 --> 02:09:27.938
Before it was 100 million.

02:09:28.105 --> 02:09:29.146
Before...

02:09:29.147 --> 02:09:30.647
We don't know what's going on.

02:09:30.813 --> 02:09:33.647
It's nuts. 5 million per coin?

02:09:33.813 --> 02:09:35.397
No way, it's a bubble.

02:09:35.563 --> 02:09:37.438
Next week
it should go back down to 1.

02:09:37.772 --> 02:09:40.480
See, even he says so.

02:09:42.647 --> 02:09:43.647
Thanks.

02:09:49.688 --> 02:09:50.938
What do we do, Manouchehr?

02:09:51.105 --> 02:09:53.105
We buy before it goes higher.

02:09:53.272 --> 02:09:56.605
If no one buys,
they'll have to bring prices down.

02:09:56.938 --> 02:09:57.938
The bubble will pop.

02:09:58.272 --> 02:09:59.813
Mr. Economist,

02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:02.522
it's a stainless-steel bubble.
It won't pop.

02:10:02.688 --> 02:10:06.230
Taxi driver analysis.
I say we don't buy.

02:10:06.397 --> 02:10:07.563
It's up to you.

02:10:07.897 --> 02:10:11.313
How many can you buy
with all the money?

02:10:11.897 --> 02:10:13.147
About 30.

02:10:13.313 --> 02:10:14.938
Buy them, then.

02:10:15.355 --> 02:10:17.563
Manouchehr says it'll come back down.

02:10:17.897 --> 02:10:20.397
I've lived in this country for 70 years,

02:10:20.563 --> 02:10:23.522
I've never seen prices come down.

02:10:23.897 --> 02:10:25.980
They have to want them to.

02:10:26.147 --> 02:10:28.522
May God help my children.

02:10:28.688 --> 02:10:32.563
I'm afraid if we buy at 5 mil,
the next day it'll go down to 1.

02:10:39.105 --> 02:10:41.105
Thank you sir, bye.

02:10:42.355 --> 02:10:44.688
Hello, sir.

02:10:45.897 --> 02:10:47.063
We want some gold coins.

02:10:47.083 --> 02:10:48.186
How many?

02:10:48.188 --> 02:10:49.188
40.

02:10:52.688 --> 02:10:53.855
320 million.

02:10:55.730 --> 02:10:57.813
One gold coin costs 8 million?

02:10:58.355 --> 02:11:01.938
The dollar just went
from 3,000 to 19,000. It's normal.

02:11:02.105 --> 02:11:04.188
You agree that it's a bubble?

02:11:04.355 --> 02:11:06.688
The dollar's set to cross
the 30,000 mark.

02:11:07.105 --> 02:11:10.063
Yesterday, a coin cost 6.
After Trump's speech,

02:11:10.230 --> 02:11:13.147
it went up to 7.
After his tweet, 8.

02:11:18.563 --> 02:11:19.563
Thank you, sir.

02:11:20.022 --> 02:11:21.688
You're welcome. Have a nice day.

02:11:22.355 --> 02:11:24.188
Is a tweet a bomb?

02:11:24.772 --> 02:11:27.063
No, but even a bomb shouldn't do this.

02:11:27.313 --> 02:11:28.397
Let's go, Dad.

02:13:17.022 --> 02:13:19.563
A gold coin now costs 14 million.

02:13:19.813 --> 02:13:21.813
The US dollar is at 28,000.

02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:23.772
Stop it, that's enough.

02:13:23.938 --> 02:13:27.355
Damn whoever's responsible for this.

02:13:28.563 --> 02:13:31.522
You sold the car 19 million, Farhad?

02:13:31.688 --> 02:13:32.688
Yes.

02:13:33.063 --> 02:13:34.980
Now it's worth 100 million.

02:13:35.397 --> 02:13:37.647
Still think it's a bubble?

02:13:38.980 --> 02:13:41.230
If you had that shop,

02:13:41.397 --> 02:13:44.438
it would be worth
at least six times as much now.

02:13:44.813 --> 02:13:47.688
If that's the case, go get it back.

02:13:50.855 --> 02:13:52.522
What did you say, Dad?

02:13:52.938 --> 02:13:54.938
They'll never agree.

02:13:55.105 --> 02:13:57.563
No harm in asking.

02:14:11.480 --> 02:14:13.147
The US dollar
crossed the 30,000 mark.

02:14:17.147 --> 02:14:19.313
We can return three of Dad's coins.

02:14:19.855 --> 02:14:21.897
Is that supposed to be funny?

02:14:22.563 --> 02:14:24.272
You don't give a shit.

02:14:29.772 --> 02:14:30.772
Check out the car.

02:14:37.522 --> 02:14:39.230
That's not a car, it's a tank.

02:15:29.563 --> 02:15:32.980
You'll get a stiff neck!
They're gone.

02:15:36.980 --> 02:15:41.688
If we'd taken over your friend's office,
we'd each have one of those cars.

02:15:42.063 --> 02:15:43.563
And one of those girls.

02:15:43.730 --> 02:15:46.730
All that fat
is interfering with your brain.

02:15:46.897 --> 02:15:51.355
If we'd taken over,
we'd owe a thousand times 120 mil!

02:15:52.063 --> 02:15:53.522
I think just the opposite.

02:15:53.813 --> 02:15:56.522
That's all you do, think the opposite.

02:15:56.855 --> 02:16:01.522
Prides were going for 20 million,
now they're 116.

02:16:01.938 --> 02:16:04.355
I presold 915 Prides.

02:16:05.313 --> 02:16:09.105
Know what 915 times 116 million
comes to?

02:16:09.522 --> 02:16:12.522
106 billion 140 million tomans!

02:16:12.688 --> 02:16:16.313
And not one customer
accepts their original 20.

02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:21.022
We had two months to deliver.
I have ten days left.

02:16:21.688 --> 02:16:23.022
I have 10 days

02:16:23.188 --> 02:16:25.272
to either deliver 915 cars

02:16:25.438 --> 02:16:28.480
or come up
with 106 billion and 140 million.

02:16:28.647 --> 02:16:32.688
If prices stop going up.

02:16:36.688 --> 02:16:37.980
Well done.

02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:50.647
So what do we do?

02:16:51.355 --> 02:16:53.522
My calculations were perfect.

02:16:53.688 --> 02:16:56.438
If prices hadn't shot up, we'd be rich.

02:16:56.980 --> 02:16:59.438
What's the solution now?

02:16:59.730 --> 02:17:01.772
I say we sue the guy.

02:17:02.105 --> 02:17:04.563
I signed a contract.
What do you think?

02:17:04.730 --> 02:17:07.438
Then turn yourself in
and settle this.

02:17:08.063 --> 02:17:09.897
What if I can't settle it?

02:17:10.272 --> 02:17:11.897
What if I get 20 years?

02:17:12.188 --> 02:17:14.022
Is your roommate at that office?

02:17:14.438 --> 02:17:16.230
No, I'm managing it.

02:17:16.813 --> 02:17:17.938
Where is he now?

02:17:18.105 --> 02:17:19.188
I don't know.

02:17:19.438 --> 02:17:20.563
He's gone.

02:17:21.188 --> 02:17:24.188
I looked for him.
He's nowhere to be found.

02:17:33.063 --> 02:17:36.313
Then you have to leave the country.

02:17:38.313 --> 02:17:41.230
People run away
with the money they embezzle.

02:17:41.397 --> 02:17:44.105
With us,
someone else enjoys the money.

02:17:44.272 --> 02:17:46.272
We get to run away.

02:17:46.438 --> 02:17:50.647
He's a loser.
If he goes abroad, he'll die of hunger.

02:17:50.813 --> 02:17:52.313
Do you even have a passport?

02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:56.522
Not a problem. Farhad's passport
still has my picture on it.

02:17:57.313 --> 02:18:00.522
I just have to not get caught
at the airport.

02:18:16.855 --> 02:18:18.938
I wasn't gonna leave it handy.

02:18:19.688 --> 02:18:21.230
I know you're upset.

02:18:22.022 --> 02:18:24.480
I ruined all your documents.

02:18:24.647 --> 02:18:27.813
Keep it if you want,
but I swear this is the last time.

02:18:30.188 --> 02:18:31.813
Not to mention it's risky.

02:18:31.980 --> 02:18:33.563
If I get caught, I could get life.

02:18:33.730 --> 02:18:35.230
You're leaving for good?

02:18:35.563 --> 02:18:37.772
- He can't stay.
- What can I do?

02:18:37.938 --> 02:18:39.355
He has to go for good.

02:18:39.647 --> 02:18:42.105
If he leaves like this,
we won't see him again.

02:18:42.272 --> 02:18:43.480
How can he leave?

02:18:43.647 --> 02:18:45.897
Now's not the time, Farhad.

02:18:46.355 --> 02:18:48.230
What do you need your passport for?

02:18:48.563 --> 02:18:50.272
I don't mean my passport.

02:18:50.438 --> 02:18:53.480
I mean how can he not get caught?

02:18:53.647 --> 02:18:55.813
Piss me off and I won't hand it over.

02:19:21.647 --> 02:19:22.688
Here.

02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:25.897
I never did anything with it.

02:19:32.688 --> 02:19:34.313
Send money if you can.

02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:37.772
If you can't, don't come back
and don't call too often.

02:19:39.897 --> 02:19:43.980
If you do, tell us you're doing great,

02:19:44.147 --> 02:19:46.105
with a good job and good money.

02:19:51.730 --> 02:19:55.647
It'd be nice if we could be reassured
about you at least.

02:20:28.563 --> 02:20:31.272
What if they arrest him at the airport?

02:20:31.647 --> 02:20:34.313
You guys are right, I'm a coward.

02:20:37.522 --> 02:20:39.605
You may not believe this,

02:20:39.772 --> 02:20:42.355
but I'm even afraid of good things.

02:20:44.188 --> 02:20:45.688
When all is well,

02:20:45.855 --> 02:20:48.855
I wait for something bad to happen.

02:20:49.897 --> 02:20:51.522
Even Maryam,

02:20:51.688 --> 02:20:54.188
I couldn't keep her
because she was too good.

02:20:55.438 --> 02:21:00.855
At the factory, I chose a girl
who didn't suit me from the get-go.

02:21:01.022 --> 02:21:04.147
And I finally broke up with her
for those reasons.

02:21:05.022 --> 02:21:09.855
I don't like imperfection,
and perfection scares me.

02:21:10.022 --> 02:21:11.355
What's that mean?

02:21:12.188 --> 02:21:14.688
I was afraid of the shop.

02:21:15.147 --> 02:21:18.522
I'm even afraid of happiness.

02:21:21.105 --> 02:21:25.147
You were taught what to think
and not how to think.

02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:41.688
Give him something he likes, at least.

02:21:41.855 --> 02:21:44.188
- You know him.
- No time to be picky.

02:21:44.355 --> 02:21:47.147
Don't get worked up,
I'll pack it myself.

02:21:47.522 --> 02:21:49.105
This is how you help him leave?

02:21:51.272 --> 02:21:54.147
You're the one
who put him out on the street.

02:21:54.438 --> 02:21:56.313
Who? Me?

02:21:56.730 --> 02:21:58.313
Who else?

02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:00.688
Isn't attack the best form of defense?

02:22:00.855 --> 02:22:02.063
What're you saying, Mom?

02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:05.897
She's worse than her brothers.

02:22:06.063 --> 02:22:09.063
If she cared at all,
she'd die of shame.

02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:10.397
Don't start, Dad.

02:22:10.730 --> 02:22:13.730
Don't, Leila. I'll do it.

02:22:13.897 --> 02:22:15.605
You don't know how to pack.

02:22:16.147 --> 02:22:17.855
Go upstairs before it degenerates.

02:22:18.022 --> 02:22:21.980
What wench did your mother use
as a model to make you?

02:22:22.147 --> 02:22:24.188
- She looked in the mirror.
- Shut up.

02:22:24.355 --> 02:22:27.272
We'd have been better off
if you'd been sterile.

02:22:27.438 --> 02:22:29.188
Why me?

02:22:29.355 --> 02:22:33.272
My sons were living their lives
and earning their crust.

02:22:33.730 --> 02:22:37.813
She's the one who should be sterile,
she caused their misfortune.

02:22:37.980 --> 02:22:39.147
That's enough, Mom.

02:22:39.313 --> 02:22:42.063
If we start finger-pointing,
we'll all in for it.

02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:44.188
They already started.

02:22:44.355 --> 02:22:46.647
If you're jobless, whose fault is it?

02:22:46.813 --> 02:22:49.313
If Manouchehr is fleeing,
whose fault is it?

02:22:49.480 --> 02:22:52.022
If we're humiliated,

02:22:52.188 --> 02:22:54.772
if we're made fun of
by friend and foe?

02:22:55.272 --> 02:22:56.313
Mom...

02:22:57.313 --> 02:22:59.855
Why can't the two of you just die?

02:23:00.022 --> 02:23:03.605
Thank God,
it's you pain is killing every day.

02:23:03.772 --> 02:23:05.397
That's enough.

02:23:06.480 --> 02:23:09.897
I wouldn't be like this
if I wasn't your maid.

02:23:10.063 --> 02:23:11.438
I gave birth to a lady.

02:23:11.605 --> 02:23:13.105
You chose to become a maid.

02:23:13.272 --> 02:23:16.313
You bitch, you love only yourself.

02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:21.313
You hate all women.
Don't make me laugh.

02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:23.730
You know why they're up shit creek?

02:23:23.897 --> 02:23:27.438
Because they were raised
by you two morons.

02:23:27.980 --> 02:23:32.480
You favor your husband over your sons,
and your sons over your daughter.

02:23:32.647 --> 02:23:35.438
You've left your daughter to inherit
nothing but misery.

02:23:35.605 --> 02:23:39.688
I had to go into debt at my age
and I'm still keeping a grip.

02:23:39.855 --> 02:23:41.563
Into debt?

02:23:42.022 --> 02:23:44.647
Will you ever stop lying?

02:23:45.647 --> 02:23:48.272
Haven't you had your revenge?

02:23:55.063 --> 02:23:57.272
Isn't this the deed to the house?

02:23:58.313 --> 02:24:02.480
Didn't you make them
return the shop for this?

02:24:02.688 --> 02:24:03.772
Where did you leave it?

02:24:04.772 --> 02:24:06.938
Why is it hidden here?

02:24:07.522 --> 02:24:10.313
He's had a secret account for 20 years.

02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:12.938
He bought the coins with his own money.

02:24:13.605 --> 02:24:16.109
Mom, who put them out on the street?

02:24:16.110 --> 02:24:17.147
Who, Dad?

02:24:17.313 --> 02:24:21.897
Me or you, who meddled in our affairs
until we were all miserable?

02:24:22.938 --> 02:24:25.188
You didn't pay for his studies.

02:24:25.355 --> 02:24:27.772
You didn't let him
marry the girl he loved.

02:24:28.147 --> 02:24:30.313
Is no one going to stop this brat?

02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:31.813
Brat?

02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:35.105
Brats are children
who haven't had an upbringing.

02:24:35.730 --> 02:24:39.397
Who haven't been encouraged
when they do good.

02:24:39.563 --> 02:24:41.813
Or punished when they do wrong.

02:24:42.563 --> 02:24:45.313
Punishment was reserved for children.

02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:48.563
But sometimes adults need punishing

02:24:48.730 --> 02:24:51.188
for them to stop
wrecking people's lives.

02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:52.897
What have you done?

02:24:53.230 --> 02:24:54.938
What've you done, Leila?

02:24:55.105 --> 02:24:58.980
Leila, what the hell did you just do?

02:24:59.147 --> 02:25:02.272
Leila! How could you? Stay here.

02:25:03.188 --> 02:25:05.730
I'm gonna kill you!

02:25:05.897 --> 02:25:07.063
Come apologize.

02:25:07.230 --> 02:25:10.438
Curse her!

02:25:29.022 --> 02:25:32.647
Leila, may God curse you.

02:26:13.753 --> 02:26:14.812
Here you go.

02:26:14.813 --> 02:26:16.688
- Is that it?
- Yes, sir.

02:27:49.688 --> 02:27:51.480
Your phone, sir.

02:27:51.994 --> 02:27:53.062
Why?

02:27:53.063 --> 02:27:54.772
They're no longer authorized.

02:28:01.522 --> 02:28:04.772
The factory owes you 12 months of wages.

02:28:05.063 --> 02:28:08.063
But the factory has closed.

02:28:08.397 --> 02:28:10.480
Management has worked hard

02:28:10.647 --> 02:28:13.313
to pay you 3 months of those wages.

02:28:13.897 --> 02:28:15.022
And the rest?

02:28:15.188 --> 02:28:17.230
The point is that's all you'll get.

02:28:17.563 --> 02:28:20.855
I lost my benefits.
I need the full amount.

02:28:21.022 --> 02:28:23.230
We can only pay 3 months.

02:28:23.397 --> 02:28:28.563
And you have to sign a statement
saying our debt's been settled.

02:28:28.855 --> 02:28:30.855
You'll be paid in cash.

02:28:31.022 --> 02:28:34.022
You owe us a year's worth of wages,

02:28:34.188 --> 02:28:37.272
and you're offering 3 months
after 90% depreciation?

02:28:37.438 --> 02:28:40.813
Don't harp on.
I explained it already.

02:28:40.980 --> 02:28:43.563
Whoever's interested can line up.

02:28:46.861 --> 02:28:47.937
Where you going?

02:28:47.938 --> 02:28:49.688
I want what I'm owed.

02:28:49.980 --> 02:28:51.438
What I worked for.

02:28:51.855 --> 02:28:53.438
You'll lose even this.

02:28:54.647 --> 02:28:55.938
It's up to you.

02:31:12.272 --> 02:31:14.105
Not on the floor.

02:31:14.272 --> 02:31:17.272
Take these plates and silverware.

02:31:23.647 --> 02:31:25.230
Hello!

02:31:25.397 --> 02:31:26.688
Thank you.

02:31:26.855 --> 02:31:29.647
You girls look lovely!
Here's my gift, sweetie.

02:31:29.813 --> 02:31:32.438
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Happy birthday!

02:31:32.605 --> 02:31:36.480
Look at those beautiful dresses.

02:31:37.272 --> 02:31:42.230
Let's see
who can blow one up fastest.

02:31:42.605 --> 02:31:43.855
One...

02:31:44.313 --> 02:31:45.354
Two...

02:31:45.355 --> 02:31:47.691
There's a present for the winner.

02:31:47.692 --> 02:31:48.730
Three.

02:32:06.147 --> 02:32:08.313
Uncle, did you lose?

02:32:09.147 --> 02:32:11.813
He got scared. He's running away.

02:32:13.313 --> 02:32:14.355
Dad...

02:32:17.230 --> 02:32:18.480
Daddy dearest...

02:32:21.897 --> 02:32:22.897
Dad...

02:32:26.813 --> 02:32:27.873
Dad.

02:33:57.313 --> 02:33:58.396
Come in.

02:33:58.397 --> 02:34:01.438
Welcome, my little angels.

02:34:03.563 --> 02:34:04.688
Here they are!

02:34:05.272 --> 02:34:07.313
Come in.

02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:09.563
Come in, my lovelies.

02:34:13.063 --> 02:34:14.230
Dad...

02:34:49.022 --> 02:34:51.605
Uncle, come dance!

02:34:52.397 --> 02:34:54.480
Come on, stand up.

02:36:46.938 --> 02:36:52.563
