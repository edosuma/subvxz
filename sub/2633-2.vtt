00:02.919 --> 00:04.169
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:04.337 --> 00:06.630
So, uh, did everything go okay
with the annulment?

00:06.798 --> 00:09.299
Oh, yeah. No problems.
It's all taken care of.

00:09.467 --> 00:10.801
- Ross, thank you.
- Ah.

00:12.429 --> 00:15.222
- You guys want to go see a movie?
- Yeah, why not?

00:15.390 --> 00:17.599
- Let me get my sweater.
- Okay.

00:20.311 --> 00:21.895
Want to hear something weird?

00:22.063 --> 00:23.397
Always.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.151
I didn't get the annulment.

00:28.903 --> 00:31.113
- What?
- We're still married.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.533
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.665
- Hey, do you have any gum?
- Oh, yeah.

00:41.833 --> 00:45.878
Wait! Wait! Hi. Ross, can I just
talk to you for just a second?

00:46.046 --> 00:47.880
Oh, but we'll be late for the movie.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.507
Oh, there's a cab. Taxi!

00:50.675 --> 00:52.176
Oh, that's great.

00:52.343 --> 00:55.012
What timing! My God, huh?
There you go.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.474
We're gonna walk.
It's right at the Angelika.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.059
Oh, the Angelika! Go! Go!

01:02.353 --> 01:04.104
You didn't get the annulment?

01:04.313 --> 01:07.441
- I know.
- Ross!

01:07.609 --> 01:10.944
I tried, but when I got to
my lawyer's office, all I heard was:

01:11.154 --> 01:13.697
"Three divorces! Three divorces!"

01:15.116 --> 01:19.661
I just don't want my tombstone to read
"Ross Geller: Three Divorces."

01:19.871 --> 01:23.415
Don't worry about that. Your tombstone
can say whatever you want.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.418
It can say,
"Ross Geller: Good at Marriage."

01:27.504 --> 01:31.799
You know? Mine's gonna say,
"Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive."

01:32.383 --> 01:35.886
All I know is, I can't have
another failed marriage.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.973
So you're gonna be married to
a girl who doesn't even know about it?

01:40.225 --> 01:42.017
Woman. Sorry.

01:43.436 --> 01:47.064
Well, okay, so I don't have it all
worked out quite yet.

01:47.315 --> 01:52.861
- Just don't say anything to Rachel.
- Rachel is one of my closest friends.

01:53.154 --> 01:57.366
But being the only one that knows
about this makes me feel special. Okay.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.830
Okay, stop, stop! Phoebe?

02:02.997 --> 02:04.373
Hey, Rach!

02:05.583 --> 02:07.126
What was that?

02:07.335 --> 02:08.961
Sorry. Mix-up.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.338
How was the movie?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.966
I haven't seen it yet.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.385
You'd better hurry. The Angelika! Go. Go!

02:16.553 --> 02:18.011
No!

02:59.637 --> 03:02.264
When we move in together,
can I get a gumball machine?

03:02.432 --> 03:05.392
Of course.
Joey wouldn't let you have one?

03:05.560 --> 03:08.812
No, when it comes to sweets,
he's surprisingly strict.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.940
Did you tell him you're moving out?

03:12.192 --> 03:15.485
No, I keep trying.
And I can get out "Joey, I have to..."

03:15.737 --> 03:19.656
Then I lose my nerve and I finish
with "...go to the bathroom."

03:20.283 --> 03:21.825
He may think I'm sick.

03:22.660 --> 03:26.163
I have to tell Rachel, but I...
We just gotta get it over with.

03:26.414 --> 03:29.666
Next time we see them,
we'll just tell them. That's it.

03:29.876 --> 03:33.045
That's how it'll work now?
You'll just order me around?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.714
- Pretty much.
- All right.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.009
Hey, Monica.
Hey, man, you feeling better?

03:43.306 --> 03:44.473
Joey.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.600
We have something to tell you.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.894
Oh, my God!

03:49.145 --> 03:50.854
You're pregnant!

03:52.523 --> 03:54.608
No! No?

03:54.776 --> 03:56.443
- No.
- No!

03:57.862 --> 04:00.155
Look, Joe, here's the thing. Um...

04:01.783 --> 04:05.577
Monica and I have decided
to live together, here.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.455
So I'm gonna be moving out, man.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.502
Wow.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.587
Oh, uh, hey!

04:15.797 --> 04:19.966
I'm really happy for you guys.
Congratulations. See you later.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.094
- Joey! Joey! Are you okay?
- Yeah.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.763
I gotta go. I've got an acting job.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.183
Like you'd believe that.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.228
This sucks!

04:31.729 --> 04:34.356
I'll be across the hall.
And I promise you...

04:34.565 --> 04:38.110
...the minute Monica and I break up,
I'm moving right back in.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.863
Look, uh, If you're gonna move in
with him...

04:42.031 --> 04:45.325
...I feel it is my responsibility
to tell you the truth about him.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.619
He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.538
He, uh, forgets to, um...

04:50.707 --> 04:53.166
He always, he always, uh...

04:53.918 --> 04:55.919
Who am I kidding?
He's the best roommate!

05:01.551 --> 05:04.011
- Hey, Pheebs. Have you seen Rachel?
- Hey.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.430
- No, why?
- I have some exciting news.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.140
You're pregnant.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.018
No!

05:12.103 --> 05:13.937
Chandler and I are moving in together.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.689
Oh, that's good!

05:15.940 --> 05:19.568
But if you were pregnant,
what would you name it? Hint, Phoebe.

05:21.362 --> 05:23.155
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.407
- What's up?
- Well, um...

05:26.784 --> 05:29.202
Chandler and I are moving in together.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.580
Oh, my God.

05:31.914 --> 05:35.459
Oh, my little sister
and my best friend...

05:35.668 --> 05:37.294
...shacking up.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.840
That's great. That's great. Mwah.

05:42.008 --> 05:45.052
- Guys, I'm happy too.
- Okay, come here.

05:46.137 --> 05:50.682
Big day, huh? People moving in.
People getting annulled.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.729
I gotta go find Rachel. But, um...

05:55.980 --> 06:00.275
If you see her, give her some really
bad news, so mine doesn't seem so bad.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.152
Okay, bye.

06:03.154 --> 06:06.073
Hmm. Something bad to tell Rachel.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.285
Bad news for Rachel.
What could that be?

06:11.537 --> 06:13.830
Can you just lay off, please?

06:14.082 --> 06:18.627
My life is an embarrassment. I should
just go live under somebody's stairs.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.923
It's not that big a deal.
You'll have been divorced three times.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.217
You'll have a life, you'll date...

06:25.426 --> 06:29.596
No, I won't. I'll be at the bottom
of the dating barrel now.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.265
The only guys below me
will be Four-Divorce Guy...

06:32.433 --> 06:34.893
...uh, Murderer Guy...

06:35.103 --> 06:36.311
...and geologists.

06:38.189 --> 06:42.192
Ross, you're being ridiculous.
You are cute and smart and sweet.

06:42.443 --> 06:45.612
That is much more important
than three stupid divorces.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.824
Have you dated anyone
who's been divorced three times?

06:49.033 --> 06:53.370
That's not fair. Most guys that have
been divorced three times are 60.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.624
Nobody cares about this except you.

06:57.834 --> 07:01.169
This embarrassment thing
is all in your head.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.506
- Here, I'll show you. Come here.
- What?

07:04.757 --> 07:08.885
Hi. My friend Ross is about to be
divorced for the third time.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.554
But wouldn't you date him?

07:11.889 --> 07:14.891
And if you wait right here,
I'll go get Ross.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.939
- Hey.
- Agh. Thought you were Rachel.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.192
- What gave me away?
- I gotta tell her.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.571
Get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe.
She's the only one left.

07:27.738 --> 07:30.407
It's official.
We're moving in together.

07:30.658 --> 07:31.783
No turning back.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.994
Are you scared? Are you?

07:35.204 --> 07:36.246
No.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.332
That was my scariest voice. You're brave.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.253
- Hey. Ugh.
- Hey.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.588
The worst day.

07:44.839 --> 07:49.426
You're finally making progress at work,
then your boss calls you Racquel.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.888
First four years of my work,
they called me...

08:01.105 --> 08:03.106
- Seriously.
- I believe you.

08:04.650 --> 08:08.528
It was in the middle of a meeting,
so no one wants to correct her.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.447
So everyone's calling me Racquel.

08:10.698 --> 08:14.409
By the end of the day, the mailroom
guys were calling me Rocky.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.581
Well, I still think you're
very, very nice and very pretty.

08:20.583 --> 08:21.625
What?

08:23.294 --> 08:24.836
All yours, babe.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.130
Rachel, come here.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.882
Have a seat.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.759
Okay.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.303
Listen, um, Chandler and I...

08:34.013 --> 08:35.847
...are going to live together.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.265
Here.

08:40.602 --> 08:41.770
Oh, my God.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.814
That's so great!

08:46.526 --> 08:48.944
I'm so happy for you guys!

08:49.153 --> 08:50.237
Really?

08:50.488 --> 08:52.822
And that was so sweet of you to ask.

08:53.032 --> 08:56.910
The three of us are gonna have
such a good time living together!

08:58.746 --> 08:59.829
Yes, we are.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.125
Chandler, you'll have to watch
those long showers you take...

09:04.377 --> 09:07.295
...because you know
Racquel can't be late.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.382
- Rach.
- He'll work on that.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.802
Oh. Aw, this is so exciting!

09:14.136 --> 09:16.012
Oh, wow.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.266
Come and knock on our door

09:21.561 --> 09:23.687
We'll be waiting for you

09:27.942 --> 09:30.944
See? Once you know the stories,
it's not that bad.

09:31.153 --> 09:34.656
First marriage: Wife's hidden sexuality.
Not my fault.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.827
Second marriage:
Said the wrong name at the altar.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.787
A little my fault.

09:42.039 --> 09:45.125
Third marriage:
They shouldn't let you get married...

09:45.376 --> 09:47.794
...when you're drunk
and have writing on your face.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.546
Nevada's fault.

09:51.048 --> 09:55.051
So, what do you think, ladies?
Who wouldn't want to date him?

09:55.386 --> 09:57.762
The divorces don't bother me.
I'd date him.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.472
But not while he's still married.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.725
And you, wouldn't you want a date?

10:01.892 --> 10:03.977
I'm not dating at all anymore.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.563
I was only dating guys
that were bad for me.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.440
So I decided that until I work that...

10:08.608 --> 10:10.066
Good. Good. Whatever.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.569
What about you, Meg?

10:12.737 --> 10:15.488
Well, I don't care about
the divorces either.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.824
But I wouldn't date him.

10:18.951 --> 10:22.746
It's just that he's obviously
still in love with this Rachel girl.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.164
What?

10:24.332 --> 10:27.667
She said, "He's obviously still
in love with this Rachel girl."

10:30.588 --> 10:33.923
This is crazy. I mean, yes,
Rachel is my good friend.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.801
And I have loved her in the past...

10:37.053 --> 10:39.346
...but now, she is just my wife.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.767
Phoebe, will you help me out here?

10:43.976 --> 10:47.020
Well, I thought you loved her
when you married her.

10:47.271 --> 10:51.691
We were drunk! I would've married
Joey with that amount of alcohol.

10:51.901 --> 10:55.362
Hey! You could do a lot worse
than Joey Tribbiani!

10:57.907 --> 10:59.741
I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.

10:59.950 --> 11:03.203
I just don't want
to be divorced three times.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.872
Yes, and now he's using
this three-divorces reason...

11:06.040 --> 11:09.209
...because he wants to stay married
to her because he loves her.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.878
I must say, well done. Bravo, Meg.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.632
Okay, fine. If this is what you think...

11:15.800 --> 11:18.134
...forget about the whole
three-divorce thing.

11:18.302 --> 11:22.597
I'll go to my lawyer's office right now
and get this marriage annulled. Okay?

11:22.765 --> 11:24.724
She means nothing to me.

11:24.892 --> 11:27.268
Noth... Nothing!

11:28.688 --> 11:32.482
Okay, now I wouldn't date you
because you seem a little creepy.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.110
I am so attracted to him right now.

11:40.491 --> 11:43.201
When will we tell Rachel
what actually will happen?

11:43.369 --> 11:44.452
Soon.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.497
I just couldn't before.
You saw how upset Joey got.

11:47.748 --> 11:50.083
I couldn't do it.
She's my best friend.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.793
Joey's my best friend.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.587
I'm not your best friend?

11:55.840 --> 11:57.257
You just said...!

11:57.425 --> 11:58.717
Ugh.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.052
Of course, you're my best friend.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.304
Would you tell Rachel?

12:03.931 --> 12:06.683
- All right. At least I'm prepared.
- Okay.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.853
- Oh, yes.
- Hey!

12:10.020 --> 12:11.563
Hey, hey.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.524
- They're not for you. Are you upset?
- I am now.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.862
Hey, roomie.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.947
Okay, bye.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.660
Rach. Ahem.

12:25.953 --> 12:29.581
There's something, um,
important I have to tell you.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.082
Are you pregnant?

12:32.293 --> 12:34.169
No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.339
I think there was a little
misunderstanding before.

12:38.507 --> 12:39.632
- Mm-hm.
- Um...

12:39.800 --> 12:44.804
When I said that, uh, Chandler and I
wanted to live together...

12:45.306 --> 12:48.266
...we meant alone together.

12:52.313 --> 12:55.482
Oh, my God. That's funny.
I can't believe I did that.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.401
No, sweetie. You know what?
This is my fault.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.278
I wasn't clear.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.530
I'm really sorry.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.659
Listen, you take as much time
as you need to move out, okay?

13:06.911 --> 13:08.620
There's absolutely no rush.

13:09.914 --> 13:15.710
Okay.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.672
Don't you want a cookie?

13:20.591 --> 13:21.758
Sure.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.428
Thanks.

13:25.596 --> 13:26.930
Do you need a tissue?

13:27.097 --> 13:28.640
Mm-hm.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.561
- Where did you get these?
- I made them.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.481
Oh, God, they're so yummy!

13:39.985 --> 13:43.488
It's gonna be weird when I come home
and you're not here.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.532
No more Joey and Chan's.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.951
No more J and C's.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.579
Want to go to Joey and Chandler's?
Can't. It's not there.

13:52.581 --> 13:55.959
I'll be across the hall.
We can still do all the same stuff.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.962
We won't be able in the night
and have those long talks...

13:59.129 --> 14:01.214
...about our feelings and the future.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.842
Not once did we do that.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.512
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:08.305 --> 14:11.432
So I told Rachel that it's just
gonna be the two of us.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.977
Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.354
Really well. Yeah.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.106
Surprisingly well.

14:18.357 --> 14:21.568
She didn't cry.
She wasn't angry or sad.

14:24.488 --> 14:27.949
And you're upset because you
didn't make your best friend cry?

14:28.701 --> 14:31.035
All I'm asking for is a little emotion.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.413
Is that too much to ask after six years?

14:33.664 --> 14:36.416
What, are Rachel and I
not as close as you guys?

14:36.625 --> 14:40.753
I mean, did we not have as much fun?
Don't I deserve a few tears?

14:42.172 --> 14:44.173
When we told Joey, he cried his eyes out.

14:44.341 --> 14:48.177
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!

14:48.721 --> 14:50.847
Come on, it's like the end of an era.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.974
No more J-Man and Channy's!

14:54.977 --> 14:57.312
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?

15:03.861 --> 15:06.154
You got married again?

15:07.156 --> 15:08.197
Yes.

15:09.116 --> 15:12.702
So that's your second marriage
in two years?

15:12.870 --> 15:15.163
Yes. Second in two years.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.749
Third, overall.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.252
I have been a divorce attorney
for 23 years...

15:21.503 --> 15:24.589
...and never have I had
so much business from one client.

15:26.508 --> 15:29.344
Why don't you tell me what happened?

15:30.262 --> 15:34.057
Basically, Rachel and I were
in Vegas, and we got drunk.

15:34.266 --> 15:37.602
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel
whose name you said...

15:37.853 --> 15:39.729
...at the altar
in the second marriage?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.773
Yes, yes, yes. Heh.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.942
But I do not love her.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.234
Oh.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.070
That's better then.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.991
This was just a drunken mistake,
and I need to get it annulled.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.326
I see.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.412
Have you considered therapy?

15:58.332 --> 16:02.126
I think just the annulment for today.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.712
- There are some forms to fill out.
- Easy.

16:04.964 --> 16:09.384
We'll need witnesses who can testify
that you were not of sound mind.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.469
No problem. Heh.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.889
We'll need you and Rachel
to testify before a judge.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.766
Ooh.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.853
There's no way to do this without her?

16:21.105 --> 16:24.983
Because I kind of already told her
it was taken care of.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.193
Of course you did.

16:29.071 --> 16:33.449
Look, you can't get an annulment
unless you and Rachel are both there.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.826
Uh-huh.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.413
What about someone
who looks like Rachel?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.958
I will think about the therapy.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.798
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:49.633 --> 16:54.012
So, um, I was thinking that maybe we
should start dividing up our stuff.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.097
Okay.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.558
No point in dragging it out.

16:59.101 --> 17:02.228
Dragging out the long process
of you moving out...

17:02.479 --> 17:04.605
...and us not living together anymore.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.107
Okay.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.445
- Hey, Rach.
- Yeah?

17:11.655 --> 17:14.240
What about this? Who gets this?

17:14.450 --> 17:18.202
I don't know if I want it because
it might be too many memories.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.414
- What is that?
- I don't know.

17:23.541 --> 17:24.584
Rachel.

17:24.917 --> 17:27.795
How about this?
I want you to have the big plate.

17:28.839 --> 17:32.091
Wow, Monica, thanks.
I love this plate.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.219
Something to remember me by.

17:36.513 --> 17:39.140
Mon, you're not dying.
I'm just moving out.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.602
We're gonna see each other
all the time.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.772
But still, it's a big change.

17:46.023 --> 17:49.150
The end of an era, you might say.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.946
Are you okay? You're not blinking.

17:55.157 --> 17:59.327
I'm fine. I was thinking about
how it's an end of an era.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.370
Oh, all right.

18:03.248 --> 18:07.418
But I gotta say, I don't think
six years counts as an era.

18:07.669 --> 18:10.546
An era is defined as
a significant period of time.

18:10.798 --> 18:14.175
It was significant for me.
Maybe it wasn't significant to you!

18:14.384 --> 18:17.804
- What is the matter with you?
- What is the matter with you?

18:19.223 --> 18:20.807
Why aren't you more upset?

18:21.058 --> 18:24.102
Aren't you gonna be sad
that we're not living together?

18:24.353 --> 18:26.312
Aren't you gonna miss me at all?

18:26.647 --> 18:29.482
Monica, all right.
But don't get mad at me.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.820
It's just a little hard to believe.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.072
What's hard to believe?

18:36.240 --> 18:40.368
I mean, it's you guys.
You do this kind of stuff, you know?

18:40.619 --> 18:44.705
You were gonna get married in Vegas,
and then you backed out.

18:44.957 --> 18:49.377
I'm not upset because I don't see you
going through with it. I'm sorry.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.423
Rachel.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.468
It's going to happen.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.303
Chandler is gonna move in here.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.390
- But I...
- No, wait. Just let me finish, okay?

19:03.308 --> 19:07.103
This isn't something that we just
impulsively decided to do in Vegas.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.856
This is something
that we both really want.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.068
And it is going to happen.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.237
It is?

19:18.407 --> 19:19.699
Really?

19:20.159 --> 19:21.826
Yeah, sweetie.

19:23.620 --> 19:27.540
You mean, we're not gonna
live together anymore?

19:28.792 --> 19:29.876
No.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.295
Well...

19:33.213 --> 19:35.965
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna miss you so much.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.967
I'm gonna miss you.

19:39.094 --> 19:40.928
I mean, it's the end of an era!

19:41.138 --> 19:42.638
I know!

19:46.018 --> 19:48.519
- Okay, bye.
- Oh, no.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.522
So did you get the annulment?

19:51.732 --> 19:54.859
- I couldn't.
- I knew it. Because you love Rachel.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.571
It's not that.
Annulments are more complicated...

19:58.822 --> 20:01.073
Complicated because of the love.

20:01.533 --> 20:04.118
I do not love Rachel.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.287
I'm telling her
about the whole thing...

20:06.538 --> 20:09.373
...so we can get this marriage
annulled as fast as possible.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.959
Would I do that if I loved her?

20:12.169 --> 20:15.129
I've never been more convinced
of your love for her.

20:15.547 --> 20:19.634
I do not have feelings
for Rachel, okay?

20:22.804 --> 20:25.181
Oh, what's wrong?

20:26.308 --> 20:28.392
Monica and Chandler are
moving in here...

20:28.644 --> 20:31.395
...and I have to move out
and everything is changing.

20:31.605 --> 20:34.815
Oh, my, come here, come here.
It's okay.

20:34.983 --> 20:37.360
Aw, everything's gonna be okay.

20:37.527 --> 20:38.653
Thank you.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.905
Of course.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.752
So Ross and Rachel got married.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.546
Monica and Chandler
almost got married.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.632
You think you and I should hook up?

21:01.718 --> 21:02.969
Oh, we do. Ha, ha.

21:03.136 --> 21:04.679
But not just yet.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.140
Really? Well, when?

21:09.184 --> 21:10.643
Okay. Um.

21:10.811 --> 21:14.272
Ahem, well, first Chandler and Monica
will get married...

21:14.439 --> 21:16.607
...and be filthy rich, by the way.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.818
- But it won't work out.
- Wow.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.152
I know.

21:21.655 --> 21:24.198
Then I'm gonna marry Chandler
for the money.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.785
And you'll marry Rachel
and have the beautiful kids.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.328
Great.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.498
But then we ditch those two
and we get married.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.710
We'll have Chandler's money
and Rachel's kids.

21:35.961 --> 21:39.964
Getting custody will be easy
because of Rachel's drinking problem.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.341
Ooh, ooh, what about Ross?

21:42.551 --> 21:44.885
I don't want to go into the whole thing,
but, um...

21:45.053 --> 21:47.638
...we have words and I kill him.
