WEBVTT

00:10.412 --> 00:13.413
Happy Valentine's Day!

00:13.482 --> 00:16.116
Oh...

00:16.184 --> 00:17.617
Okay.

00:17.686 --> 00:19.486
- You ready?
- Yeah.

00:19.511 --> 00:21.144
I'm so excited, Paula.

00:21.396 --> 00:24.324
I just... I know I'm
making the right decision.

00:24.393 --> 00:27.227
You're gonna share your true
love with the whole world.

00:27.920 --> 00:29.462
And it doesn't get any bigger than that.

00:29.531 --> 00:31.631
Come on, we're late, and
they're waiting for us.

00:31.656 --> 00:33.155
Okay. Okay.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:42.285 --> 00:43.951
Man, leave it to Rebecca

00:43.976 --> 00:46.009
to make a big production
out of everything.

00:46.034 --> 00:47.434
Whatever.

00:47.459 --> 00:49.989
I'm just glad I don't have
to spend Valentine's Day

00:50.014 --> 00:51.280
with my wife.

00:51.331 --> 00:53.698
I think it's exciting and romantic.

00:53.767 --> 00:55.400
I love a big reveal.

00:55.425 --> 00:57.191
Like, check this out.

00:58.338 --> 01:00.116
Ah. Oh, solid.

01:00.141 --> 01:01.640
I thought there were sleeves there.

01:02.652 --> 01:06.121
Okay, this is real, this is real.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.433
Ah...

01:07.458 --> 01:09.191
my heart is beating so quickly.

01:09.216 --> 01:11.216
Okay, listen, you can do this.

01:11.329 --> 01:13.062
I will be right here,

01:13.087 --> 01:16.154
and if you get nervous,
you look at me. Okay?

01:16.267 --> 01:17.433
Okay.

01:17.458 --> 01:18.657
And hey,

01:18.682 --> 01:20.249
enjoy this moment.

01:21.058 --> 01:23.195
It took a long time to get here.

01:23.307 --> 01:24.807
Yeah.

01:26.467 --> 01:27.499
Yeah, it did.

01:28.969 --> 01:31.570
Ooh, thank you so much for
seeing me on such short notice

01:31.638 --> 01:33.004
and first thing in the morning.

01:33.116 --> 01:35.884
I keep my Valentine's
Days open for walk-ins.

01:35.909 --> 01:37.539
Big trigger day.

01:37.564 --> 01:40.232
Yeah, so, I'm in a bit
of a panic, Dr. Akopes.

01:40.257 --> 01:42.257
Uh, I went on three
dates with three guys,

01:42.282 --> 01:45.060
and I have no clarity on the situation.

01:45.085 --> 01:47.185
It's killing me. I'm not eating,

01:47.210 --> 01:49.522
I'm not sleeping, and those
are usually my two best events.

01:49.634 --> 01:52.261
I just, I have to pick a guy
by the end of Valentine's Day,

01:52.286 --> 01:53.925
and, uh, that's today.

01:53.950 --> 01:56.017
Okay, Rebecca, I hear you...

01:56.468 --> 01:58.697
and I think I have the answer.

01:59.159 --> 02:00.275
An answer?

02:00.300 --> 02:01.399
Mm-hmm.

02:01.468 --> 02:02.745
Oh, thank God. You usually want me

02:02.769 --> 02:04.069
to figure things out on my own,

02:04.094 --> 02:05.726
which I think is such a waste of money.

02:05.751 --> 02:06.950
Not today.

02:07.138 --> 02:10.304
Today I have a wonderful
treatment for you.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.873
A treatment?

02:13.708 --> 02:15.995
- Is it another pill?
- Nope.

02:16.250 --> 02:19.417
I'm gonna show you... your future.

02:21.933 --> 02:24.299
- Oh, you're not Dr. Akopian.
- Mm-mmm.

02:24.324 --> 02:25.790
- You're the Dream Ghost.
- Mm-hmm.

02:25.815 --> 02:27.315
- I'm asleep right now.
- Mm-hmm.

02:27.742 --> 02:29.104
This morning you decided

02:29.129 --> 02:30.695
to try one of Josh's green juices

02:30.720 --> 02:33.387
and had to run to the bathroom,
fell asleep on the toilet.

02:33.412 --> 02:34.912
That's where you are right now.

02:35.112 --> 02:37.846
Yeah, that sounds like me.

02:37.981 --> 02:40.148
I can show you anything you want.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.639
What would you like to see?

02:44.625 --> 02:46.164
Who I should choose.

02:47.038 --> 02:48.389
Show me that.

02:56.327 --> 02:57.607
Huh.

03:16.859 --> 03:18.248
Oh, my God.

03:19.733 --> 03:20.779
It's Greg.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.797
Of course I should choose Greg.

03:26.030 --> 03:28.063
Ugh, we're so happy. Look at us.

03:37.745 --> 03:41.969
Wait, what's wrong? What's that
empty and sad look on my face?

03:43.670 --> 03:46.476
Do I not love Greg? Does
he not make me happy?

03:48.008 --> 03:49.966
O-Okay, who should I choose, then?

03:51.798 --> 03:52.941
Oh.

03:54.571 --> 03:55.547
Nathaniel.

03:55.913 --> 03:57.048
I see what you're doing.

03:57.161 --> 03:58.627
Yep, I should be with Nathaniel.

03:58.652 --> 04:01.386
Show me the future
with Nathaniel, please.

04:01.534 --> 04:02.510
Of course.

04:02.789 --> 04:04.873
Yeah. Yeah.

04:05.436 --> 04:08.203
Oh, my gosh...

04:08.228 --> 04:09.806
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, what is that?

04:09.830 --> 04:11.507
- Okay.
- I definitely want this.

04:11.575 --> 04:13.976
- Look what I found.
- Oh, is that...

04:14.001 --> 04:17.002
- It's Baby Ruth Gator Ginsberg!
- Where did you get this?

04:17.070 --> 04:18.414
I got it at this random store...

04:18.438 --> 04:20.204
Yes.

04:20.230 --> 04:22.029
Oh, my gosh, look at
that. I mean, look at it.

04:22.142 --> 04:23.790
It's Nathaniel.

04:24.621 --> 04:26.054
I should choose Nathaniel.

04:26.428 --> 04:27.527
Of course.

04:29.551 --> 04:31.617
And we look so happy.

04:34.588 --> 04:36.521
I love you.

04:42.530 --> 04:43.655
Oh, no.

04:44.775 --> 04:47.476
No, no, no, no. There's,
there's that-that look again.

04:47.501 --> 04:49.100
That sad, empty look.

04:50.309 --> 04:51.503
So... okay,

04:51.528 --> 04:53.362
does this mean it's Josh?

04:53.856 --> 04:54.683
Who knows?

04:55.182 --> 04:56.675
You're so vague.

04:57.459 --> 04:58.843
Am I?

05:05.652 --> 05:07.752
Oh.

05:08.922 --> 05:10.855
That is very...

05:14.438 --> 05:15.871
All right, I mean, I guess you guys,

05:15.896 --> 05:17.336
you guys ate a lot of your waffles...

05:18.965 --> 05:20.677
- Which is very good, funny...
- Babe, they're both delicious.

05:20.701 --> 05:21.800
Yep.

05:21.868 --> 05:24.035
It's Josh. Yeah.

05:24.104 --> 05:25.036
This is happiness.

05:25.105 --> 05:26.338
Did you fill out

05:26.363 --> 05:27.796
the form for the Sacramento trip?

05:27.821 --> 05:28.987
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

05:29.012 --> 05:30.490
Why didn't we just start with this one?

05:31.008 --> 05:32.341
It's great.

05:33.146 --> 05:34.913
It's gonna be so fun.
It's gonna be so fun.

05:34.948 --> 05:36.806
Here we go. Come on.

05:36.831 --> 05:37.796
All right, honey,
I'll see you later... oh...

05:37.821 --> 05:38.728
Anyone want their...

05:38.752 --> 05:40.251
- Walk, walk, walk...
- No dinosaur, okay.

05:40.599 --> 05:41.599
Bye, bye, bye.

05:41.624 --> 05:43.156
See you.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.265
What?

05:54.685 --> 05:56.018
No, no, no, no...

05:56.043 --> 05:57.727
There's that look again.

05:59.687 --> 06:01.172
Okay.

06:01.285 --> 06:04.745
So, clearly, I'm not happy
in any of these futures.

06:06.080 --> 06:06.945
Why?

06:07.443 --> 06:08.880
I don't know.

06:08.992 --> 06:10.425
Do you know?

06:10.450 --> 06:11.883
Okay. You're useless.

06:11.995 --> 06:14.301
All right, I'm just gonna
figure this out myself. Hey.

06:14.714 --> 06:16.802
Hey! Hello, hi.

06:16.827 --> 06:18.093
Hey, what's wrong?

06:18.736 --> 06:20.602
What's wrong? What's wrong with Josh?

06:20.627 --> 06:22.040
Why don't you love him?

06:23.161 --> 06:24.627
Why aren't you happy?

06:26.564 --> 06:28.163
Ugh, I need answers.

06:28.447 --> 06:29.575
Just... come on.

06:31.085 --> 06:33.485
Just... For a spirit, you are slow.

06:37.530 --> 06:39.097
Okay. What's the problem?

06:39.591 --> 06:41.212
Is Nathaniel cheating on you?

06:41.338 --> 06:43.214
Uh... me? Us?

06:43.283 --> 06:44.378
Huh?

06:44.728 --> 06:46.495
Damn it, I need answers.

06:48.755 --> 06:52.490
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.060
Tell me.

06:56.129 --> 06:57.043
Huh?

06:57.452 --> 06:59.252
Tell me why you're so sad.

06:59.974 --> 07:01.666
Why aren't you happy with Greg?

07:01.964 --> 07:03.730
Huh? I mean, what's wrong with him?

07:06.520 --> 07:08.283
There's nothing wrong with Greg.

07:08.430 --> 07:11.342
Or Nathaniel or Josh.

07:11.630 --> 07:12.820
They're all wonderful.

07:13.320 --> 07:16.091
Okay, then why am I not
happy, with any of them?

07:16.116 --> 07:17.715
Don't-don't I love them?

07:17.922 --> 07:19.517
You do love them.

07:19.629 --> 07:20.862
The problem is,

07:20.887 --> 07:23.252
you don't know who you are.

07:28.319 --> 07:30.161
No, that's not true.

07:31.774 --> 07:33.708
Stupid Dream Ghost.

07:35.386 --> 07:37.762
What a dumb dream.

07:40.955 --> 07:42.618
Oh, I'm not done. I'm
gonna be here a while.

07:42.642 --> 07:45.910
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

07:54.389 --> 07:57.895
Hi. Hi, hi, how are you? Mm, hey.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.269
Okay. I got your text.

07:59.294 --> 08:01.177
What's wrong? I got
here as fast as I could.

08:01.202 --> 08:03.531
Nothing's wrong. I'm really excited.

08:03.556 --> 08:06.557
Look, I read online that there
are these new expungement rules,

08:06.582 --> 08:08.403
and I checked, and
my shoplifting charges

08:08.428 --> 08:10.361
are eligible to be
stricken from my record.

08:10.386 --> 08:12.040
Oh, wow, oh, that's great news.

08:12.065 --> 08:15.032
Yeah, it could change my life.
I wouldn't be a felon anymore,

08:15.057 --> 08:16.599
- no more parole.
- Mm-hmm.

08:16.624 --> 08:18.269
So I just need you to
help me file the casework

08:18.294 --> 08:19.437
and we can get the process started,

08:19.461 --> 08:22.391
- you know?
- I'm so sorry, I can't.

08:22.416 --> 08:24.786
This new job that I have,
I'm exclusive to my firm,

08:24.811 --> 08:26.911
and I checked my contract
and I just, I can't

08:26.936 --> 08:29.457
do any outside cases
anymore. I'm so sorry.

08:29.482 --> 08:32.249
But I've already talked to
Nathaniel, Sunil and Rebecca

08:32.274 --> 08:34.240
about taking over all of my cases.

08:34.265 --> 08:35.496
But you know my case.

08:35.707 --> 08:37.421
And you care more than anyone.

08:37.446 --> 08:38.712
I know.

08:40.528 --> 08:41.927
But, hey, look,

08:41.952 --> 08:44.405
I get it. We're friends.
I'm happy for you.

08:44.430 --> 08:45.556
You love that job.

08:46.055 --> 08:47.854
I'll work with someone else.

08:48.344 --> 08:51.365
I am so sorry, Hanifa.

08:52.795 --> 08:54.205
Damn it.

09:02.438 --> 09:03.804
So, did you hear from Rebecca?

09:03.872 --> 09:06.406
If I had heard from Rebecca,
would I be here talking to you?

09:06.475 --> 09:08.542
Uh, probably. Yeah. You're a bit needy.

09:08.611 --> 09:09.821
She said she was supposed to let me know

09:09.845 --> 09:11.111
by the end of the day, so...

09:11.180 --> 09:12.112
What does that mean?

09:12.181 --> 09:13.947
Is she gonna call? Text?

09:14.016 --> 09:15.849
Send a rose over here
in per... I-I'm unsure

09:15.918 --> 09:17.417
about the mechanics of this thing.

09:17.797 --> 09:19.296
Which is a bit annoying.

09:19.464 --> 09:21.676
You helped set up this
whole three date thing

09:21.701 --> 09:24.001
and you don't know how Rebecca
was supposed to respond?

09:24.026 --> 09:25.592
Eh, that's not the fun part.

09:25.661 --> 09:29.385
Wow. Having a beer at 10:00 a.m.

09:29.410 --> 09:31.143
Unlike you.

09:31.300 --> 09:34.635
Waiting for Rebecca to decide,
it's just killing me, man.

09:34.660 --> 09:36.427
Yeah, I wonder how she'll tell you.

09:36.613 --> 09:39.327
She's kind of dramatic. She
might just call you all together

09:39.352 --> 09:41.552
and pop out of a giant cheesecake.

09:41.577 --> 09:44.355
Are those cheesecakes they jump out of?

09:44.380 --> 09:45.900
Well, whatever she decides,

09:45.948 --> 09:48.415
she'll do it in a great way,
because she's the woman I love

09:48.440 --> 09:49.919
and she's great.

09:51.106 --> 09:53.094
Oh... Oh, dear.

09:53.119 --> 09:55.366
I just want to be in love.

09:55.391 --> 09:58.058
Get married, have babies. I'm ready now.

09:58.698 --> 10:01.361
She has to pick me.

10:01.473 --> 10:03.707
Oh, God, I'm so cold.

10:04.448 --> 10:07.968
- Hold me.
- Okay, I-I will not hold you.

10:08.081 --> 10:11.315
But I do have an extra fleece in my car.

10:11.340 --> 10:12.806
Thank you. Yeah.

10:12.875 --> 10:14.641
I've been trying to distract myself

10:14.666 --> 10:16.857
from thinking about Rebecca
and her decision with my work,

10:16.882 --> 10:20.224
but half-assing cases at a nothing firm

10:20.249 --> 10:22.149
is just not doing it for me anymore.

10:25.187 --> 10:26.953
I'm sorry, should I not
say that to you guys?

10:26.978 --> 10:28.077
It's fine.

10:28.102 --> 10:29.735
Daddy and Papa understand.

10:29.892 --> 10:32.857
Sir? I just need a
signature on this file.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.942
But while my bosses are
here, I did want to ask,

10:34.967 --> 10:37.947
what is the company policy on fun hair?

10:38.267 --> 10:40.834
- I don't think we have one.
- No.

10:40.903 --> 10:42.247
I was thinking about
growing my hair long.

10:42.856 --> 10:45.138
Not for a man bun,
but for a sweet, sweet pony.

10:45.163 --> 10:46.233
Oh. Oh.

10:46.258 --> 10:48.119
It's gonna take about
a year to grow out.

10:48.143 --> 10:50.631
And there are gonna be some
awkward stages along the way,

10:50.656 --> 10:51.989
so I need your blessings. Yes.

10:52.014 --> 10:53.346
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes?

10:53.371 --> 10:55.004
I've had the same haircut since 1998,

10:55.029 --> 10:56.228
so I don't care.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.062
You make it seem great.
Thank you so much.

10:58.087 --> 10:59.386
I have nothing for you to sign,

10:59.455 --> 11:01.242
I just wanted to ask that question.

11:01.824 --> 11:04.358
Giddy-up, pony!

11:04.383 --> 11:06.620
Anyway, guys, what do
you think? What do I do?

11:06.645 --> 11:08.673
Well, maybe take a
break. Like a sabbatical.

11:08.697 --> 11:10.263
Oh, that's a great idea.

11:10.288 --> 11:12.314
I've always wanted to go to Israel.

11:13.869 --> 11:15.790
Don't sabbaticals
have to do with Israel?

11:16.275 --> 11:19.183
Well, I mean the word "sabbath"
and "rabbi" are both in there.

11:19.977 --> 11:21.085
For what it's worth,

11:21.110 --> 11:22.656
I think Rebecca's gonna pick you.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.098
'Cause you're the best.

11:24.983 --> 11:27.247
And you don't have
any venereal diseases.

11:27.272 --> 11:28.371
Not that I know of.

11:28.484 --> 11:31.017
But check for human papilloma virus.

11:31.042 --> 11:32.730
It's more common than you think,

11:32.755 --> 11:35.230
and most men do not experience symptoms.

11:35.868 --> 11:38.558
Okay, great. Great,
tip, thank you, Bert.

11:38.670 --> 11:41.148
You're right. I'm
probably just...

11:41.173 --> 11:43.897
stressing about Rebecca,
and my life and my job

11:43.922 --> 11:47.120
are not as lame, boring
and sad as they seem.

11:48.953 --> 11:50.270
Again, no offense.

11:56.409 --> 11:57.577
Honey, you here?

11:57.646 --> 11:59.725
Hey.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.792
Oh, hi. I am so happy you're here.

12:01.817 --> 12:05.852
Okay, look. I know today is
your Valentine's decision day

12:05.877 --> 12:07.121
and you have a lot on your mind,

12:07.189 --> 12:09.398
but I need your help.

12:09.714 --> 12:12.659
I can't work at the county
jail because of my new job,

12:12.684 --> 12:14.183
and it is killing me.

12:14.208 --> 12:15.752
And I know that you and
Nathaniel are covering

12:15.777 --> 12:17.894
a lot of it, but

12:18.367 --> 12:21.468
I really care about the work
that we're doing down there,

12:21.493 --> 12:23.472
and I just...

12:23.786 --> 12:24.786
What do I do?

12:25.074 --> 12:26.678
Ah-huh.

12:27.709 --> 12:29.509
Well, you could just ask Julia to start

12:29.534 --> 12:32.702
a pro Bono arm of the firm
and offer free representation.

12:32.727 --> 12:34.760
- That's a thing?
- It's definitely a thing.

12:34.917 --> 12:35.941
Lot of firms do it.

12:35.966 --> 12:37.665
Hey, did you just solve my problem?

12:37.834 --> 12:40.948
I mean... I hope so.

12:40.973 --> 12:42.756
That's great!

12:42.825 --> 12:44.591
Because, you know, sometimes I

12:44.616 --> 12:46.714
ask your advice on
stuff, and then you just

12:46.739 --> 12:48.772
talk about yourself
and... but this time...

12:48.797 --> 12:50.397
- Oh, I did that right?!
- Yes!

12:50.465 --> 12:52.666
- Oh, cool!
- So proud of you.

12:52.734 --> 12:54.034
Um...

12:54.102 --> 12:55.769
What else can I say that's helpful?

12:55.794 --> 12:57.460
Well, hey, Paula,

12:57.485 --> 12:59.718
never give up on what you believe in.

13:00.395 --> 13:02.609
Well, I will not.

13:02.634 --> 13:04.110
Great. Okay.

13:04.179 --> 13:08.048
- So, is it appropriate to
talk about myself now? - Yes.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.083
Great. Okay. So, just now,

13:10.152 --> 13:12.063
I was in the bathroom, and
I was asleep on the toilet...

13:12.087 --> 13:13.998
- Multitasking. Smart.
- Thank you.

13:14.308 --> 13:15.989
And I had just the worst dream.

13:16.102 --> 13:17.835
- Aw.
- So, I dreamt that I had a future

13:17.860 --> 13:19.426
with each of the three guys.

13:19.494 --> 13:22.996
But in no future was I happy.

13:23.021 --> 13:24.508
And then Bride Rebecca
turned to me and said...

13:24.533 --> 13:26.144
There were three Rebeccas,
one of them was, like,

13:26.168 --> 13:27.367
a really pretty bride...

13:27.436 --> 13:29.469
And she turned to me, and she said

13:29.538 --> 13:31.959
that the reason I wasn't happy with them

13:32.519 --> 13:34.519
was because I don't know who I am.

13:34.770 --> 13:36.269
And then I woke up!

13:36.545 --> 13:37.722
So I don't know what that meant,

13:37.746 --> 13:39.057
'cause that's crazy, right?

13:39.081 --> 13:40.180
Well, do you?

13:41.015 --> 13:42.382
- Of course I do!
- Okay.

13:42.407 --> 13:44.294
I mean, God, no one's worked harder

13:44.319 --> 13:45.867
on themselves than I have, you know?

13:45.892 --> 13:48.688
I got workbooks and meds and
therapy coming out the wazoo.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.592
Yeah. But...

13:51.704 --> 13:53.693
you're Rebecca.

13:53.718 --> 13:55.105
So, I mean, those thoughts

13:55.130 --> 13:57.692
are coming from you.

13:59.159 --> 14:00.613
Damn it.

14:02.537 --> 14:03.703
You're right.

14:03.772 --> 14:06.206
I have no idea who I am.

14:08.507 --> 14:10.941
You and my unconscious...

14:11.446 --> 14:13.996
As manifested by a very
pretty bride... are right.

14:15.091 --> 14:16.045
Oh, Cookie.

14:18.949 --> 14:20.219
Uh, how?

14:20.244 --> 14:21.977
How is this possible?

14:22.524 --> 14:25.079
I've done so much work.

14:26.106 --> 14:28.538
And now, I'm more
confused than I ever was.

14:29.007 --> 14:32.232
And it's Valentine's Day,
and it's already... What time is it?

14:32.257 --> 14:33.661
11 o'clock.

14:35.229 --> 14:37.003
11 o'clock, Paula!

14:37.028 --> 14:40.772
Okay, it's... I mean, 11:00
a.m., it's, uh, the day is young.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.944
No, just, 11 o'clock
is a significant time.

14:43.969 --> 14:45.802
If we were in a musical,

14:45.827 --> 14:48.394
this is where I would perform
my big 11 o'clock number.

14:49.484 --> 14:51.017
Really? You don't know... okay.

14:51.042 --> 14:54.287
An 11 o'clock number is
a big showstopping number

14:54.312 --> 14:55.912
with some sort of thematic revelation,

14:55.937 --> 14:57.670
and it usually happens
around 11:00 p.m.,

14:57.695 --> 15:00.170
because shows used to
start at 8:30, but now

15:00.195 --> 15:01.539
they start earlier for some reason.

15:01.563 --> 15:02.933
Uh, okay.

15:03.148 --> 15:04.847
What do I do?

15:05.832 --> 15:07.267
Well...

15:07.292 --> 15:09.121
What I think that you sh...

15:13.417 --> 15:14.349
Rebecca?

15:14.625 --> 15:16.514
Woo-hoo, hello?

15:16.645 --> 15:17.945
Shh.

15:18.128 --> 15:19.641
What are you doing?

15:19.666 --> 15:20.832
Give me one sec, one second.

15:22.451 --> 15:23.731
Oh, I get it.

15:24.517 --> 15:26.052
You're doing that thing that you do.

19:02.506 --> 19:04.073
Hey!

19:05.468 --> 19:06.468
What?

19:12.776 --> 19:16.189
Okay! Next up at our open mic,

19:16.323 --> 19:20.759
we have a lady who is here to reveal

19:20.784 --> 19:23.385
the biggest decision of her life.

19:24.015 --> 19:27.132
So it shouldn't be
self-indulgent at all.

19:27.201 --> 19:31.003
I suffer from insomnia, and I
think we've just found the cure.

19:31.072 --> 19:32.605
George, I can't see.

19:32.674 --> 19:34.974
Oh, I'm sorry, Maya.

19:34.999 --> 19:37.032
Is my lustrous ponytail
blocking your view?

19:37.101 --> 19:41.013
Yes. You know, in the year since
you grew that lustrous ponytail,

19:41.575 --> 19:43.248
you've gotten a big ego.

19:43.273 --> 19:45.669
Well, I'm sorry. But
it's a part of who I am.

19:45.694 --> 19:46.952
I call her

19:46.977 --> 19:48.003
"Raven's Nest."

19:48.028 --> 19:49.781
- Shut up, come on.
- All right, everybody.

19:49.879 --> 19:52.359
Next up... Please help me
welcome to the stage

19:52.416 --> 19:54.116
Regina Nota Brunch.

19:55.438 --> 19:58.244
Yeah, I clearly wrote "Rebecca
Nora Bunch" on the card.

19:58.269 --> 20:00.535
Oh. Do you want to do this,
or do you want to do that?

20:05.661 --> 20:07.539
Hi, everyone. Um...

20:08.198 --> 20:10.053
Happy Valentine's Day.

20:10.078 --> 20:12.044
Thank you so much for all being here

20:12.113 --> 20:13.946
on this very, very,
very important holiday.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.471
So...

20:16.496 --> 20:19.964
one year ago today, I made
a very important decision.

20:20.657 --> 20:22.014
That's the reason
you're here, of course.

20:22.522 --> 20:25.168
But before I get to that, I, uh...

20:26.532 --> 20:29.214
I just want to say
how inspired I've been

20:29.606 --> 20:32.154
by everyone in this
room, and their journeys

20:32.179 --> 20:33.567
over the past year.

20:34.497 --> 20:36.369
And I'm just talking about my
friends, not the other people

20:36.393 --> 20:38.593
who are here for the other
acts in the open mic. Sorry.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.156
Valencia and Beth.

20:43.233 --> 20:47.302
You two took a big step,
and you did it your own way.

20:49.616 --> 20:50.749
Will you?

20:50.774 --> 20:53.408
Valencia, yes.

20:55.806 --> 20:57.946
That was the perfect proposal.

20:58.015 --> 21:00.148
It was exactly what
I wanted... a moment...

21:00.173 --> 21:01.639
just for us.

21:04.521 --> 21:06.121
Is that a drone outside the window?

21:06.190 --> 21:07.534
Of course it's a drone,
what are we doing?

21:07.558 --> 21:09.024
Right, of course.

21:09.136 --> 21:10.602
Wait, show 'em the ring.

21:11.047 --> 21:13.114
- We did it.
- We did it!

21:15.420 --> 21:17.017
Darryl and April.

21:18.408 --> 21:20.775
You two created a blended family.

21:21.140 --> 21:23.015
April adopted Hebecca.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.806
Oh, wow.

21:24.831 --> 21:26.164
- Darryl.
- I know.

21:26.189 --> 21:28.390
- That's amazing.
- Thank you.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.422
Wow, so you're gonna have three kids

21:30.447 --> 21:31.847
in one house, that's a lot.

21:32.817 --> 21:33.815
Four.

21:33.927 --> 21:35.260
No.

21:35.285 --> 21:37.406
Mm-hmm. It's that super sperm.

21:38.622 --> 21:39.941
Oh, we are so excited.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.900
We already picked out
some names, we've got

21:41.925 --> 21:43.692
Harryl and Hapril

21:43.717 --> 21:45.779
and Hannison and...

21:46.830 --> 21:48.730
- I'm kidding.
- Okay.

21:48.755 --> 21:50.391
Okay.

21:50.416 --> 21:52.146
By the way, we just found out,

21:52.171 --> 21:53.704
so don't tell anyone.

21:53.904 --> 21:55.169
Lips are sealed.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.673
- And now there's another
baby! Congratulations... - Oof.

21:58.698 --> 22:01.065
Oh, I wasn't supposed to
say anything, I'm so sorry.

22:01.090 --> 22:02.688
Why do you tell her things?

22:02.713 --> 22:04.646
I honestly have no idea.

22:05.749 --> 22:07.282
Heather and Hector.

22:07.351 --> 22:10.752
You also have have a new
addition to your family.

22:10.979 --> 22:13.346
One we all love and adore.

22:14.491 --> 22:16.273
Shout out to your new hot tub.

22:17.773 --> 22:19.707
Oh, yeah.

22:21.843 --> 22:23.776
Oh... ooh.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.735
My back... Ah...

22:26.804 --> 22:28.136
Oh, my back. Ah.

22:28.205 --> 22:29.365
Do you want to see a picture?

22:29.406 --> 22:31.106
Sometimes she drives me crazy,

22:31.131 --> 22:32.818
but eight jets, four light settings,

22:32.843 --> 22:35.583
jumbo cup holders? She's perfect.

22:35.951 --> 22:37.651
She has her daddy's hair.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.381
- In her filter.
- Yeah.

22:40.865 --> 22:42.064
And White Josh.

22:43.472 --> 22:46.121
Something happened...

22:46.190 --> 22:48.590
with you this year...

22:48.702 --> 22:51.436
that was really important...

22:51.504 --> 22:54.873
I want to say it involves the circus.

22:55.272 --> 22:57.740
My a-apartment burned down.

22:57.765 --> 22:58.930
Along with everything I own.

22:59.043 --> 23:00.150
On the same day that

23:00.183 --> 23:03.054
my childhood home also burned
down in the same wildfire.

23:03.341 --> 23:04.575
- That was it.
- Yeah.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.670
I was at the circus when I
found out that that happened.

23:08.057 --> 23:10.854
And I left the circus, as you recall...

23:11.842 --> 23:13.175
'cause the circus was over.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.332
Right.

23:14.357 --> 23:15.589
I'm sorry about that.

23:16.071 --> 23:17.995
I never really came around on you.

23:18.450 --> 23:19.926
Never will.

23:20.663 --> 23:21.830
Respect.

23:21.855 --> 23:23.922
"Respect" is not an
appropriate response there.

23:24.887 --> 23:26.395
- Respect.
- Okay.

23:27.630 --> 23:29.162
And Paula...

23:31.209 --> 23:32.495
what you did...

23:33.277 --> 23:34.610
A pro Bono arm

23:34.635 --> 23:36.435
of the firm will allow us to represent

23:36.460 --> 23:37.926
women who are forgotten

23:37.951 --> 23:40.103
or outright mistreated by the system.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.055
I did a lot of research
and I put together

23:42.080 --> 23:43.613
a proposal for you.

23:43.670 --> 23:46.499
Um, many firms have these
programs and they offer

23:46.524 --> 23:49.758
great PR and some tax breaks, as well.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.434
What an amazing ask.

23:52.459 --> 23:54.959
It's so indicative of why we hired you.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.785
Oh, great.

23:56.810 --> 23:57.758
Oh!

23:57.783 --> 23:59.420
Oh, I am so relieved.

23:59.445 --> 24:00.711
But we're busy

24:00.736 --> 24:02.877
with the cases we already
have and we're trying

24:02.902 --> 24:04.635
to make the most money for the partners.

24:04.832 --> 24:06.598
You understand.

24:07.695 --> 24:08.928
Yeah, I know.

24:08.953 --> 24:10.486
Um, I really do.

24:10.511 --> 24:11.810
Uh, and-and...

24:12.506 --> 24:14.467
the thing is, is, uh...

24:14.492 --> 24:16.294
and I say this with so much affection,

24:16.319 --> 24:18.548
um, either we do this, or...

24:20.522 --> 24:21.821
I quit.

24:22.216 --> 24:23.219
What?

24:23.244 --> 24:24.627
I love this job.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.632
But I am not gonna walk
around with a hole in my heart

24:28.657 --> 24:30.401
because there are people
out there who need me

24:30.426 --> 24:32.663
and I'm sitting up here
on my ass in a fancy suit.

24:34.578 --> 24:37.645
I have to be true to who I am... inside.

24:38.270 --> 24:39.836
So.

24:40.856 --> 24:42.232
Thanks.

24:43.559 --> 24:45.259
I loved it here.

24:48.812 --> 24:49.938
Bye.

24:56.411 --> 24:57.977
Paula, wait.

25:01.029 --> 25:02.663
Let's talk.

25:05.414 --> 25:06.781
Damn, Paula.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.506
That was bad-ass.

25:10.167 --> 25:12.501
Which brings us to another person.

25:13.380 --> 25:15.378
The person I care about very much.

25:15.962 --> 25:17.328
And...

25:17.794 --> 25:19.727
he's really the reason I'm here.

25:22.589 --> 25:23.988
Josh Chan.

25:32.254 --> 25:34.611
Josh, you really are the
reason I'm here tonight.

25:42.798 --> 25:43.841
I know you've been waiting

25:43.866 --> 25:45.332
for me to make a decision today.

25:45.580 --> 25:46.451
Yeah.

25:48.086 --> 25:49.585
Josh...

25:52.833 --> 25:54.675
Some day you're gonna find a girl

25:54.700 --> 25:56.634
who is perfect for you.

25:57.337 --> 25:59.931
And honestly, I feel
like it'll happen soon

25:59.956 --> 26:01.756
because you are ready

26:01.781 --> 26:03.714
for a serious relationship.

26:05.535 --> 26:08.036
You mean so much to me,
I hope you know that.

26:10.895 --> 26:12.161
But I'm sorry.

26:16.570 --> 26:17.859
Oh.

26:18.682 --> 26:19.901
Yeah.

26:21.991 --> 26:23.757
Can I have a minute?

26:24.905 --> 26:27.210
Of course, yeah.

26:29.765 --> 26:31.398
Without you here?

26:31.467 --> 26:32.900
Oh.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.191
Yes. Absolutely. Mm-hmm. Hmm.

26:35.216 --> 26:37.149
Yes.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.693
I'll just go, I'll go in my...

26:43.330 --> 26:44.890
But I'm gonna give you your space. Um...

26:49.707 --> 26:51.830
You sure I can have Estrella?

26:51.854 --> 26:54.154
Of course, you really forged

26:54.179 --> 26:56.046
a beautiful bond with number 28.

27:00.363 --> 27:01.962
Well, I got to run, uh...

27:01.987 --> 27:03.586
I got a magic club meeting.

27:03.611 --> 27:05.344
We let in some more members

27:05.369 --> 27:07.603
and George is having a
party to celebrate, so, yeah.

27:07.628 --> 27:09.594
- Well, that sounds fun.
- Yeah.

27:10.790 --> 27:12.190
See you.

27:15.778 --> 27:17.193
Good-bye, Josh Chan.

27:18.614 --> 27:20.314
I'm shocked that I'm doing this.

27:20.426 --> 27:22.426
But $80 a month is a great deal.

27:22.451 --> 27:23.951
Oh, we're gonna have so much fun.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.408
I'm a great roommate.

27:25.521 --> 27:27.263
Question... do you own a vibrator?

27:28.124 --> 27:29.923
You will never know.

27:32.587 --> 27:34.721
I should stop asking people that.

27:35.631 --> 27:37.731
Josh, I moved to West Covina for you.

27:39.359 --> 27:41.393
And I will never forget that.

27:42.540 --> 27:45.167
And I'm so, so happy for you.

27:45.708 --> 27:47.544
That you found what you wanted.

27:48.544 --> 27:49.676
With a little magic.

27:50.054 --> 27:51.312
You found love.

27:54.176 --> 27:56.296
They met in a magic club,
that's why I'm saying magic.

27:56.831 --> 27:58.963
Oh, she's sweet.

27:58.988 --> 28:00.220
Yeah.

28:00.245 --> 28:02.278
She's also a lot.

28:02.625 --> 28:04.491
I know, but in a good way.

28:04.560 --> 28:07.961
And then, Nathaniel.

28:11.144 --> 28:12.543
Okay, Nathaniel.

28:12.568 --> 28:13.837
So what I want to say

28:13.861 --> 28:15.256
_

28:15.304 --> 28:16.502
- is that...
- Ah.

28:16.921 --> 28:18.120
Huh.

28:19.671 --> 28:21.685
Uh, based on your words, tone,

28:21.710 --> 28:23.644
and body language, I'm guessing...

28:23.756 --> 28:25.389
we're not riding off into the sunset

28:25.414 --> 28:27.373
on the horses I rented, are we?

28:27.660 --> 28:30.528
There are horses? Where are the horses?

28:30.553 --> 28:31.952
In the stable.

28:32.021 --> 28:33.603
With the champagne.

28:34.501 --> 28:36.835
And the giant diamond.

28:40.262 --> 28:42.529
Okay, um...

28:42.642 --> 28:44.575
You have to know, you have to know

28:44.600 --> 28:46.600
that the-the times that
we've spent together

28:46.625 --> 28:48.036
have been some of the best of my life.

28:49.246 --> 28:51.446
But, I... You don't, you
don't have to explain.

28:55.165 --> 28:56.898
You only get one life.

28:58.969 --> 29:00.869
And you got to live
that the way you want.

29:04.156 --> 29:06.089
I think everyone deserves that.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.109
I'm quitting, Dad.

29:09.134 --> 29:10.734
I don't want to work for you anymore,

29:10.759 --> 29:12.058
or anyone, for a while.

29:14.706 --> 29:16.373
No, you can't forbid it.

29:16.398 --> 29:17.898
I'm a grown-up man.

29:17.935 --> 29:19.501
Mm-hmm. Mm.

29:19.602 --> 29:21.201
Oh, yeah? Well, I love you.

29:24.222 --> 29:26.617
Thanks for your support, guys.
It really has meant a lot to me.

29:26.642 --> 29:28.008
Of course.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.033
Jinx.

29:29.111 --> 29:30.388
Now, if you'll excuse me,

29:30.412 --> 29:31.912
I need to see a man...

29:31.937 --> 29:33.194
about a monkey.

29:34.770 --> 29:36.802
_

29:36.827 --> 29:39.770
_

29:40.047 --> 29:42.047
_

29:42.071 --> 29:43.258
_

29:44.949 --> 29:46.137
_

29:46.162 --> 29:47.027
_

29:47.051 --> 29:48.312
_

29:48.336 --> 29:49.715
_

29:49.739 --> 29:50.898
_

29:50.922 --> 29:52.215
_

29:53.018 --> 29:55.353
_

29:56.369 --> 29:58.065
_

29:58.350 --> 29:59.558
_

30:00.622 --> 30:01.740
_

30:03.351 --> 30:05.784
_

30:10.108 --> 30:11.718
Hola.

30:11.787 --> 30:13.253
¿Cómo estás?

30:13.278 --> 30:15.145
You upended your life.

30:15.816 --> 30:17.668
You changed everything.

30:18.117 --> 30:19.927
But, unlike me,

30:19.995 --> 30:21.628
you did it for the right reasons.

30:21.918 --> 30:23.918
And I am in awe of you.

30:25.837 --> 30:27.236
And finally...

30:31.307 --> 30:32.880
Hi, Greg.

30:40.536 --> 30:42.269
Greg, uh...

30:42.747 --> 30:45.315
Uh, Greg, I, uh... I don't know...

30:45.891 --> 30:48.192
what I can say to you that
I haven't already said.

30:49.216 --> 30:50.453
So tell me. Yes or no.

30:50.478 --> 30:51.587
Just say it fast.

30:51.612 --> 30:53.445
- I... So, before I tell you,
- _

30:53.470 --> 30:55.937
I just, I want you to...

30:55.970 --> 30:57.614
I want you to understand
the choice I'm making.

30:57.762 --> 31:00.096
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:00.580 --> 31:02.611
So, this morning,

31:02.636 --> 31:05.093
I had a terrible dream
while on the toilet.

31:05.118 --> 31:06.417
This is starting off well.

31:06.442 --> 31:08.106
Right. And then Paula came over.

31:08.131 --> 31:09.464
Trying to follow.

31:09.489 --> 31:11.589
Greg, you deserve a full explanation,

31:11.701 --> 31:13.868
and here it is. So...

31:13.937 --> 31:17.505
Right, toilet, Paula came over,

31:17.530 --> 31:19.230
I helped her through an issue,

31:19.255 --> 31:21.911
and then she asked me

31:22.542 --> 31:24.401
probably the most important question

31:24.470 --> 31:25.970
anyone's ever asked me in my life.

31:29.575 --> 31:32.743
Rebecca, hello? Hey!

31:34.514 --> 31:36.642
- What?
- What are you doing?

31:36.825 --> 31:39.225
Uh, sorry, nothing, nothing.

31:39.250 --> 31:41.076
No, that's not nothing.

31:41.101 --> 31:44.773
That's... You're staring
off into space, like you do.

31:45.679 --> 31:46.878
You do that a lot.

31:47.193 --> 31:48.392
What's...

31:48.620 --> 31:50.470
what's happening when you do that?

31:54.994 --> 31:56.434
I don't want to tell you. It's weird.

31:56.459 --> 31:59.961
Oh, come on, any weirder than
the many, many weird things

31:59.986 --> 32:01.884
you and I have done since we met?

32:02.535 --> 32:04.809
I've just... I don't know...
I've never told anybody,

32:04.834 --> 32:07.468
except for the Dream Ghost and Dr. Phil.

32:07.923 --> 32:08.913
What?

32:08.981 --> 32:12.354
What the hell? Okay.

32:12.379 --> 32:14.812
When I stare off into space...

32:17.991 --> 32:20.357
I'm imagining myself
in a musical number.

32:22.226 --> 32:25.728
That's how I sometimes
see big moments in my life,

32:25.955 --> 32:27.388
as musical numbers.

32:28.907 --> 32:31.990
And because I do that, so does the show.

32:32.700 --> 32:36.050
And by show, I mean the very
popular BPD workbook acronym,

32:36.075 --> 32:37.675
"Simply Having Omniscient Wishes."

32:38.178 --> 32:40.578
So, yeah, I...

32:40.646 --> 32:42.202
I see myself in these songs.

32:44.491 --> 32:46.283
Wait, I'm confused. What?

32:46.540 --> 32:50.187
All right. Paula, can I
show you something?

32:50.212 --> 32:51.399
You can show me anything.

32:51.424 --> 32:52.482
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:52.514 --> 32:54.380
Look off with me like this.

32:54.910 --> 32:56.033
Do I have to be thinking
anything while I...

32:56.058 --> 32:57.343
- Just-just look off.
- Okay.

33:02.640 --> 33:03.640
Whoa.

33:05.734 --> 33:06.736
What...

33:07.622 --> 33:09.556
What is all this?

33:10.517 --> 33:12.309
This is me.

33:13.371 --> 33:14.689
Okay, these are all

33:14.714 --> 33:17.047
of the identities that
I've tried to fit into.

33:17.805 --> 33:19.016
Okay?

33:19.085 --> 33:21.719
So this is all the weird and freaky

33:21.744 --> 33:24.732
and dumb and useless
stuff that is my life

33:24.757 --> 33:26.357
and has led me to nothing.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.827
It's not nothing.

33:29.896 --> 33:31.031
It's...

33:31.910 --> 33:33.876
it's beautiful.

33:36.168 --> 33:38.669
What do you mean, beautiful?
I can't focus here.

33:38.694 --> 33:40.125
Let's go back to reality.

33:40.150 --> 33:42.717
Okay, wait, I'm sorry,
what do you mean, beautiful?

33:43.570 --> 33:44.466
Okay.

33:44.491 --> 33:47.968
Those-those songs that you
imagine, when you come back,

33:47.993 --> 33:51.201
you've always figured
something out, right?

33:52.142 --> 33:54.028
I mean, yeah,

33:54.053 --> 33:55.986
I guess I've processed something, sure.

33:56.011 --> 33:57.444
And have you ever written them down?

33:58.819 --> 34:01.825
Written down my-my mind songs?

34:01.850 --> 34:03.281
No. Why would I do that?

34:03.306 --> 34:05.475
I mean, the-the closest
I came to that, I guess,

34:05.500 --> 34:06.811
was during the community theater revue

34:06.836 --> 34:08.168
when I changed those lyrics.

34:08.303 --> 34:10.737
And you loved that, right?

34:12.752 --> 34:14.181
- Yeah.
- Okay.

34:14.206 --> 34:17.274
Rebecca, just... get me back there.

34:17.299 --> 34:19.167
Uh, okay, uh...

34:21.847 --> 34:23.638
Baby, it's here.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.092
What you're looking for,

34:26.118 --> 34:27.449
the way to know who you are,

34:28.210 --> 34:29.810
it's here.

34:33.072 --> 34:34.338
Are you sure?

34:36.460 --> 34:39.594

34:39.799 --> 34:42.333

35:04.047 --> 35:06.281
These songs in your head,
you have to write them down.

35:07.101 --> 35:08.735
That's how you do it.

35:09.813 --> 35:11.816
Write them down.

35:11.841 --> 35:14.275
Write down the songs.

35:14.542 --> 35:16.717
Write down the songs. Okay. Okay.

35:16.742 --> 35:20.323
Uh, I need paper! You need a pen!

35:23.396 --> 35:25.224
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

35:26.907 --> 35:29.808
Now get started.

35:38.236 --> 35:39.957
This is gonna be so much fun.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.245
I know it sounds crazy.

35:49.667 --> 35:51.681
Writing down the flights
of fancy in my head.

35:51.794 --> 35:52.726
I mean, you know,

35:52.751 --> 35:55.138
what even is that? But, Greg,

35:55.420 --> 35:58.254
I've been doing it for
the past couple hours,

35:59.520 --> 36:03.742
and I think Paula's right,
this is what I need to do.

36:04.179 --> 36:06.254
And you need to do this alone?

36:06.279 --> 36:07.802
Yeah.

36:08.194 --> 36:10.370
I think that's how this works.

36:11.928 --> 36:13.623
And I don't know how
long it's gonna take.

36:13.648 --> 36:17.716
Okay, I hear you, Rebecca.
You just got to know that...

36:18.246 --> 36:21.914
I'm not gonna wait, not anymore.

36:23.339 --> 36:24.471
I know.

36:26.843 --> 36:28.801
Greg, when I look at you,

36:28.826 --> 36:31.360
I see someone who's ahead of me,

36:31.385 --> 36:32.934
and who has been ahead of me.

36:33.362 --> 36:34.561
Your recovery,

36:35.533 --> 36:38.865
and then your love for Serrano's, I...

36:39.673 --> 36:41.673
I want that for myself.

36:41.698 --> 36:43.965
She wants to own an Italian restaurant?

36:43.990 --> 36:46.324
Oh, come on, you know what she means.

36:48.294 --> 36:49.988
God, I wish you were not still single.

36:50.749 --> 36:53.116
I will not feel safe until
one of you is married.

36:53.328 --> 36:56.162
Oh, shh. Just let her talk.

36:56.602 --> 36:59.363
And so, over the past year,

36:59.388 --> 37:03.957
I have done some really
new and really scary things.

37:04.172 --> 37:06.706
"When writing songs,
the most important thing

37:06.731 --> 37:09.300
"is to learn to tell your story,

37:09.801 --> 37:11.901
"not a story you get
from the outside world,

37:11.926 --> 37:13.545
but your own story."

37:14.363 --> 37:17.197
AJ, this book's, like, amazing!

37:17.258 --> 37:19.425
You borrowed my Dartmouth
sweatshirt again?

37:19.660 --> 37:21.894
There are chocolate stains all over it.

37:22.257 --> 37:23.818
Sorry.

37:26.431 --> 37:28.899
I'll just get him a Harvard
sweatshirt, it's better.

37:28.924 --> 37:30.624
Okay, the best songs...

37:31.072 --> 37:32.376
How many years of piano

37:32.400 --> 37:34.273
- have you had?
- None.

37:34.623 --> 37:36.623
What other instruments do you play?

37:36.648 --> 37:37.627
None.

37:38.195 --> 37:40.675
What do you know about piano?

37:41.852 --> 37:45.961
There appear to be black
keys and white keys.

37:47.445 --> 37:49.569
Well, showing up is the first step.

37:49.594 --> 37:51.661
Yeah, it is. Let's do this.

37:51.698 --> 37:53.099
Okay. Can I call you Rick?

37:53.124 --> 37:55.095
- Uh, sure.
- Is that your name?

37:55.136 --> 37:57.469
No, but call me Rick.

37:57.494 --> 37:59.461
Okay. Thanks, Rick.

38:11.123 --> 38:13.656
Yeah, uh, that's... That was, um...

38:13.681 --> 38:16.148
- Was it better than last week?
- Sure.

38:16.173 --> 38:18.036
Okay, great, 'cause I've
been working really hard.

38:18.061 --> 38:20.829
Yeah. You're getting most of the notes.

38:20.933 --> 38:22.732
- You're getting there.
- Yes!

38:22.757 --> 38:24.824
- It's just gonna take a while.
- Great.

38:24.849 --> 38:25.981
Okay.

38:27.848 --> 38:30.682
I don't know about that last
lyric. I don't think it's good.

38:30.989 --> 38:32.222
Oh, I liked it.

38:32.377 --> 38:34.177
Take it easy on yourself.

38:34.202 --> 38:37.397
Yeah. I think it's catchy, and
I have great taste.

38:37.422 --> 38:39.833
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, keep going.

38:39.858 --> 38:41.991
You're doing great, honey.

38:43.645 --> 38:45.389
Will you stop mentioning that hot tub?

38:45.414 --> 38:47.781
I'm gonna look really
snatched for the wedding.

38:54.222 --> 38:56.604
And, look, I don't know
if what I'm doing yet

38:56.629 --> 39:01.698
is any good, but all I know is that

39:01.723 --> 39:03.656
I can finally show the outside world

39:03.681 --> 39:05.671
what's been inside
of me this whole time.

39:06.264 --> 39:09.732
All of it. All of the-the
nuances and the gray areas.

39:10.461 --> 39:13.518
It's not just about the act
of writing. It's about how,

39:13.543 --> 39:15.068
when I'm doing that,

39:15.239 --> 39:17.205
when I'm telling my own story...

39:19.981 --> 39:22.382
for the first time in my life,

39:22.727 --> 39:24.394
I am truly happy.

39:25.449 --> 39:27.357
It's like I just met myself.

39:27.999 --> 39:31.217
Like I just met Rebecca.

39:32.773 --> 39:34.769
I came to this town to find love,

39:36.137 --> 39:37.526
and I did.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.977
I love every person in this room.

39:41.907 --> 39:43.567
Each and every one of you.

39:44.746 --> 39:46.841
Again, just talking to my
friends, not the other people

39:46.866 --> 39:48.333
here for the open mic night.

39:48.358 --> 39:49.636
But, you know what, screw
it, I love you guys, too.

39:49.661 --> 39:51.394
Love that sweater.

39:53.893 --> 39:55.226
And now,

39:55.677 --> 39:58.617
for the first time in
my life, I can say that

40:00.146 --> 40:02.248
maybe I'm finally ready

40:02.273 --> 40:06.141
for the other kind of love.

40:06.325 --> 40:09.092
You know, the kind we
talk about a lot more.

40:09.209 --> 40:12.577
And, hell, it-it might be with
someone in this room.

40:32.840 --> 40:35.083
But whoever it's with, it won't be

40:36.020 --> 40:38.148
"ending up" with someone,

40:38.902 --> 40:42.159
because romantic love is not an ending,

40:43.213 --> 40:45.820
not for me or for anyone else here.

40:47.697 --> 40:50.798
It's just a-a part of your story,

40:51.336 --> 40:52.885
a part of who you are.

40:55.645 --> 40:57.008
And so,

40:57.033 --> 40:58.236
um...

40:58.927 --> 41:00.493
here we go.

41:12.450 --> 41:14.550
This is a song I wrote.
