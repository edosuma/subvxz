01:47.160 --> 01:49.891
One, two, three.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.725
Paper beats rock.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.580
Oh, I totally thought
that would crack you up.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.001
Ooh, pardon! Sorry, Twyla.

01:57.360 --> 02:00.409
I was just wondering
what it is like to do that.

02:02.520 --> 02:03.500
Oh.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.380
I guess gargoyles can't swim, huh?

02:06.480 --> 02:08.925
No, I'd sink right to the bottom.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.408
But I bet it's amazing.

02:12.280 --> 02:16.922

02:28.880 --> 02:30.180
I've got the need for leads.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.328

Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, Spectra.
What's the matter?

02:37.360 --> 02:40.660
I'm trying to come up with something
new to post to the Ghostly Gossip

02:40.760 --> 02:42.060

02:42.160 --> 02:44.561
It's been nearly two weeks
since my last blog update

02:44.800 --> 02:46.962
and my readers
are getting very impatient.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.780
Don't worry, ghoul friend,
I've got your back.

02:50.880 --> 02:54.180
After this meet is over,
I'll help you find a good story.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.820
No, a great story! I promise.

02:56.920 --> 03:01.050
That is so sweet, Clawdeen.
How come you're always there for me?

I'm gonna go check with the ghosts.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.340

Come on, ghosts.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.411
You've got to have a story
for the Ghostly Gossip.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.090
- Operetta?
- Let's see.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.728
Okay, Manny and Iris broke up,
then they got back together.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.220
- And then they...
- Old news.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.322
I need something fresh.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.480
Oh! I heard Mr. Hack bites his toenails.

You cheat on one essay
in Creative Frightening class

03:42.560 --> 03:44.900

to give these to you.

Don't know, you'll have
to ask my ghost friend.

anything by it,

posting rumors like that.

No, there's no way she's being haunted.

are you sure that's a good idea?

12:52.080 --> 12:54.048
Spectra, what is going on?

12:55.400 --> 12:58.404
You have to promise not to tell anyone.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.485
There's another world, a Ghost World,

13:01.760 --> 13:04.081
where all the different types
of ghosts come from.

13:04.240 --> 13:06.100
There are phantoms like Operetta,

13:06.200 --> 13:07.725
banshees like Scarah,

13:07.840 --> 13:11.322
and even faceless ghosts
like my old friend Kiyomi.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.091
And don't forget us reapers.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.340
(SQUAWKING)

13:14.440 --> 13:17.820
Then how come we've never heard
about this Ghost World?

13:17.920 --> 13:20.340
It's a secret because most ghosts

13:20.440 --> 13:22.920
are pretty nervous around outsiders.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.090
You're what we ghosts
refer to as "solids."

13:26.440 --> 13:27.441
Solids?

13:28.240 --> 13:29.605
Her story checks out.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.460
Most ghosts have never even seen

13:31.560 --> 13:33.289
outsiders from the Monster World.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.642
They'd probably be pretty scared
if they saw you.

13:36.280 --> 13:39.329
My family left Ghost World
a long time ago.

13:39.640 --> 13:43.201
They thought Monster High
would be a good place for me.

13:43.960 --> 13:47.521
This boat will take us back
to my old school,

13:48.200 --> 13:50.043
Haunted High.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.961
Unbelievable.

13:53.200 --> 13:57.842
A whole other school sitting
right next to Monster High.

13:58.280 --> 14:01.284
So, what brings you back
to the Ghost World, Spectra?

14:01.480 --> 14:03.801
Draculaura is being haunted.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.605
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

14:06.120 --> 14:10.380
That's impossible.
Ghosts don't haunt the Monster World.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.131
There hasn't been a haunting since...
(GASPS)

14:13.400 --> 14:14.765
...the Red Lady.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.260
What is the Red Lady?

14:16.360 --> 14:20.380
The legend of the Red Lady
is a story that every ghost learns

14:20.480 --> 14:21.820
when they're very young.

14:21.920 --> 14:26.130
Hundreds of years ago,
the Red Lady was the scariest,

14:26.320 --> 14:29.380
most notorious ghost
in the Monster World.

14:29.480 --> 14:32.006
No one was safe from her hauntings.

14:32.360 --> 14:36.020
They say the Red Lady figured out
a way to quickly travel

14:36.120 --> 14:39.203
between the Ghost World
and the Monster World.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.260
The Red Lady became more infamous
with every ghostly crime.

14:44.360 --> 14:45.361
(SCREAMING)

14:45.520 --> 14:48.763
Nothing delighted her more
than hiding in the shadows,

14:49.200 --> 14:51.806
waiting for just the right moment
to jump out...

14:52.000 --> 14:55.163
- (GASPS)
- ...and scare unsuspecting outsiders.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.842
But one day, her scaring spree
finally came to an end

14:59.040 --> 15:02.203
when the Red Lady was captured
and locked away.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.580
They say the weight of her crimes
was so heavy

15:06.680 --> 15:10.082
that it will take her centuries
to pay her debt to society.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.200
Sorry, I just love a good ghost story.

15:14.360 --> 15:15.407
Yeah.

15:15.880 --> 15:16.881
Me, too.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.100
That's why there aren't
hauntings anymore.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.620
No ghost ever wants to face
the same fate as the Red Lady.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.449

16:07.440 --> 16:10.649
Would you be so kind as to sign this
for my ghost pirate class?

16:11.440 --> 16:14.020
I am Vandala Doubloons!

16:14.120 --> 16:19.160
Captain of the Salty Spectre,
fiercest ghost pirate on the haunted seas!

16:19.280 --> 16:20.281
And I'm...

16:21.600 --> 16:23.011
Very seasick!

16:23.840 --> 16:26.220
Come on Vandala, get it together.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.009
Vandala, it's okay.

16:43.240 --> 16:46.100
They're, uh... nice solids.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.964
You're sure they're not here
to haunt me?

16:48.120 --> 16:51.488
'Cause I have been handling
a lot of cursed treasure lately.

16:51.640 --> 16:57.540
Um, Spectra, if this is how ghosts
at Haunted High are going to react to us...

16:57.640 --> 17:00.380
No, it should be fine,
as long as you're with me.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.380
But it wouldn't be a bad idea
to disguise you ghouls

17:03.480 --> 17:05.260
so you don't attract too much attention.

17:05.359 --> 17:07.727
River Styxx has got you covered.

17:07.960 --> 17:12.170

Oh, my ghoul, it's boo-tiful!

18:01.320 --> 18:04.244
I can't believe my parents
never told me about this place.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.407
Ooh, I like your, um...

- Aye, Aye.

Aye, Aye!

18:15.280 --> 18:17.726
It's as if nothing changed since I left.

Well, almost nothing.

Oh.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.611
That's a strange fashion statement.

Those are detention chains,

18:27.800 --> 18:29.723
courtesy of Principal Revenant.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.128
Detention? They're being punished?

18:32.280 --> 18:34.220
If you get caught breaking the rules,

18:34.320 --> 18:36.448
you get chains
that you have to work off.

18:37.240 --> 18:41.211
Sometimes with extra homework,
sometimes you get chores.

18:41.320 --> 18:45.120
I had to swab the floors for months
to work off my last detention.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.500
There are lots of
different types of chains,

18:47.600 --> 18:49.340
but they all work the same way.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.060
As long as you're in detention,

18:51.160 --> 18:53.766
you can't leave Haunted High.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.700
Ghouls, somebody here has to know

18:56.800 --> 18:58.529
something about Draculaura's haunting.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.540
I say we hit the creepateria
and ask around.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.641
Aye, aye!

Wow! Incredible!

19:17.400 --> 19:21.041
Are you sure this is the creepateria?

19:21.520 --> 19:23.761

- Oh! How are you?

- TWYLA: Wow.

- Who's the popular ghoul?
- Wait.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.486
That's Kiyomi?

19:34.800 --> 19:36.768
I'd recognize that face anywhere.

- Have we met before?
- No!

You're turning green.

- How she expresses herself.
- Well, she didn't stick around very long.

It's fine. We're not here
for classmate reunions.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.203
We're here to help Draculaura.

25:19.920 --> 25:23.208
But that's not fair!
You just made that rule up!

25:23.360 --> 25:24.700
Yeah, she does that.

25:24.800 --> 25:25.801
Not helping.

25:27.280 --> 25:28.580
Uh, look out for the paint.

25:28.680 --> 25:29.681
(ALL GRUNTING)

25:29.920 --> 25:32.048
PORTER: Another brilliant work of art.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.940
I think I'll call it,

25:34.040 --> 25:36.486
"You ghouls should get out of here
while you can."

25:37.320 --> 25:38.420
Good trip.

25:38.520 --> 25:41.000
Yeah, we'll have to do this
again sometime.

25:47.480 --> 25:48.481
(GASPS)

25:49.080 --> 25:50.206
Hey, ghouls.

25:50.360 --> 25:54.081
We've got a trio of grumpy ghosts
headed this way, fast!

25:54.600 --> 25:56.170
Maybe they just want to party.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.420
Ha-ha!

25:59.520 --> 26:01.045
Now we're talking!

26:08.480 --> 26:10.528
I guess they only work
if you're a ghost.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.100
(ALL SCREAMING)

26:12.200 --> 26:13.820
Okay, here comes your stop.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.126
It's been a pleasure!

26:19.680 --> 26:21.523
Oh. We made it!

26:23.040 --> 26:27.170
Whoo! Never thought I'd be so happy
to see this creepy old attic.

26:27.440 --> 26:30.420
I'm sorry we didn't figure out
who was haunting you, Draculaura.

26:30.520 --> 26:33.046
But don't worry, we'll... (GASPS)

26:33.440 --> 26:34.930
- Spectra!
- No, Spectra!

26:35.800 --> 26:36.847
Hang on!

26:37.360 --> 26:38.885
SPECTRA: Help me!

26:39.720 --> 26:41.245
No, no, no, no!

26:41.360 --> 26:44.620
They trapped Spectra in the Ghost World!

26:44.720 --> 26:45.940
We have to do something!

26:46.040 --> 26:48.140
Yeah, but what?

26:48.240 --> 26:51.620
We're marching right back in there
to get our ghoul friend.

26:51.720 --> 26:55.088
Wait. You heard the new rule,
no non-ghosts allowed.

26:55.200 --> 26:59.046
She's right. If we go back,
we might get Spectra in even more trouble.

26:59.160 --> 27:03.085
So to go back to Ghost World, all you ghouls
have to do is turn into ghosts.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.286
Ready? And, go!

27:08.560 --> 27:11.660
I see a lot of staring

27:11.760 --> 27:14.286
but not a lot of turning into ghosts.

27:14.640 --> 27:16.722
We can't turn into ghosts.

27:16.920 --> 27:20.049
No. Actually, Sirena's totally right.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.531
Thank you!

27:21.920 --> 27:24.060
Uh, what am I right about?

27:24.160 --> 27:25.980
Listen, if we're ghosts, then we're not

27:26.080 --> 27:27.889
breaking the rules if we go back.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.764
And I know how we can do it.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.167
Well.

27:52.640 --> 27:55.291
Spectra Vondergeist.

27:55.600 --> 27:59.650
You certainly caused quite a scene.

27:59.800 --> 28:00.801
(SPITS)

28:01.120 --> 28:02.804
Explain yourself.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.500
Principal Revenant,
I'm sorry I broke your rule

28:05.600 --> 28:07.443
bringing my friends to Ghost World.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.740
But, look, I don't belong here.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.808
My school is Monster High.

28:11.920 --> 28:17.450
Yes, let's talk about this Monster High.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.884
You're not the only ghost
who goes there?

28:21.160 --> 28:24.420
Well, no, there are a lot of ghosts
at Monster High.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.887
Every kind of monster is welcome.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.403
How very progressive.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.643
I think we are done here.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.220
It's going to take you
quite a bit of time

28:36.320 --> 28:39.005
to work off that detention chain.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.660
(WHIMPERING) And how do I do that?

28:41.760 --> 28:46.482
By completing 10,000 essays
on the complete works of Ghostoyevsky.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.601
(GASPS)

28:47.760 --> 28:50.127
And then doing it one more time.

28:51.360 --> 28:54.682
That could take forever!
When will I blog?

28:54.840 --> 28:58.162
I'm sure I don't know.

29:01.520 --> 29:05.380
Ms. Revenant, you haven't heard anything
about any of your students

29:05.480 --> 29:07.687
haunting the Monster World, have you?

29:07.880 --> 29:11.851
Of course not!
There hasn't been a haunting since...

29:12.040 --> 29:13.121
The Red Lady?

29:13.240 --> 29:16.005
Oh! Yes, that's the one.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.806
Terrible, just terrible.

29:22.640 --> 29:29.171
I had no idea there were so many students
in the Monster World.

29:30.120 --> 29:33.460
I have a job for you

29:33.560 --> 29:37.770
that will enhance our attendance.

29:45.160 --> 29:48.130
The Haunted Herald
by Spectra Vondergeist.

29:48.360 --> 29:52.041
- What's this, homework or something?
- No, just a blog idea I'm working on.

29:52.280 --> 29:56.080
So you're like writing for, uh... fun?

29:56.280 --> 29:59.489
- Sure. I love writing. It helps me...
- (PORTER SNORING)

30:02.440 --> 30:06.331
It helps me figure things out.
Makes me feel good.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.925
Work out my frustrations.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.691
You want to work out your frustrations?
You should try painting.

30:11.160 --> 30:12.740
Oh, no thanks.

30:12.840 --> 30:16.220
Never been much of a "paint
on the walls" kind of ghoul.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.481
Suit yourself.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.924
Isn't that what got you detention
chains last time?

30:23.480 --> 30:25.721
Relax. It's my locker.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.923
You should give writing a try.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.690
Might keep you out of trouble.

30:29.880 --> 30:32.645
Hey. You know,
this is actually kind of...

30:32.800 --> 30:33.801

30:34.520 --> 30:35.646

Twyla, it doesn't matter how often

30:48.560 --> 30:50.449
you have us over to the Boogie Mansion,

30:51.800 --> 30:54.087
I get lost every time.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.460
Wait. Where's Draculaura?

30:56.560 --> 30:59.166
- She was just here.
- (KNOCKING)

31:00.760 --> 31:03.684
I think I took a wrong turn.

31:10.440 --> 31:14.650
Yikes. For once I think I'm okay
with not having a reflection.

31:16.200 --> 31:19.204
Still being haunted. Oh, goodie.

31:19.680 --> 31:20.761
Not.

31:35.680 --> 31:37.170
Your house is fun!

31:38.200 --> 31:39.929
It's in there.

31:44.280 --> 31:45.964
Oh, my ghoul.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.442
What is all of this?

31:49.840 --> 31:53.380
It's boogie sand. My dad uses it
for his boogie man work.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.820
Each one can change you
into a different monster.

31:55.920 --> 31:59.003
We just need to find the one
that says "Ghost" on it.

32:00.880 --> 32:01.900
Ah! (GIGGLES)

32:02.000 --> 32:03.100
Is this it?

No. That is not it.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

32:23.560 --> 32:24.540
What's that?

32:24.640 --> 32:27.689
I'm trying to write down everything
that happens for Spectra.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.884
This is gonna make
a great story for her blog.

32:31.080 --> 32:35.608
Rare and ethereal. Ghost sand.

You ghouls ready to get ghosty?

32:39.560 --> 32:41.420
Oui, so very ready.

32:41.520 --> 32:45.411
How does this work, Twyla?
Will it be permanent?

32:45.520 --> 32:48.888
Yeah, yeah, until you use
a different kind of sand.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.363
See, after we save Spectra,
we'll come back here

32:51.480 --> 32:53.900
and use the other sands
to change back to normal.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.209
Draculaura will use vampire sand,
Clawdeen werewolf sand,

32:57.440 --> 32:58.521
you get the idea.

32:58.920 --> 33:01.400
Okay, then, let's do this.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.601
For Spectra.

On the count of three.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.564
Yeah, I've tried that, too.

33:57.880 --> 34:01.327
But as long as you have that chain,
you can't leave the school.

34:01.640 --> 34:02.641
Ow!

34:02.840 --> 34:03.900
Gotta stop doing that.

34:19.600 --> 34:20.806
You are really good.

34:20.960 --> 34:23.850
You can read my blog
here in the Ghost World?

34:25.520 --> 34:28.649
I managed to unblock
a portal and did a search.

34:28.920 --> 34:32.766
Okay, so now all of a sudden
you think writing is a good thing?

34:33.280 --> 34:36.681
Look, I'm sorry I said it was boring.

So, you're kind of a reporter,
journalist, right?

34:51.120 --> 34:52.451
I like to think so.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.980
Well, good, because I need help,
uh... journaling.

34:56.080 --> 34:57.206
I'm not following.

Principal Revenant.

34:59.320 --> 35:02.927
I know she's up to something.
Something bad.

35:03.240 --> 35:06.460
I want your help,
to find out what it is.

35:06.560 --> 35:09.140
Are you sure it's not just
because you don't like her?

35:09.240 --> 35:12.740
Back at Monster High,
there's this ghoul named Toralei and she...

35:12.840 --> 35:14.888
No, no, it's something else.

35:17.720 --> 35:20.340
All the rules and chains she gives out,

35:20.440 --> 35:24.500
there's got to be more to it
than just handing out detention.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.900
It's worse than it's ever been.
It's not fair.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.020

36:34.400 --> 36:36.380
If Ms. Revenant is up to something,

36:36.480 --> 36:40.883
we might find some kind of clue
by looking into her past.

All right, ghost ghouls,
let's find Spectra

51:13.640 --> 51:16.849
is haunt dog day in the creepateria.

51:18.120 --> 51:19.121
(ALL CHEERING)

51:25.120 --> 51:30.260
Now then, it's very important
that you ghouls tell me

51:30.360 --> 51:32.980
how you turned yourselves into ghosts.

51:33.080 --> 51:35.260
Why should we tell you anything?

51:35.360 --> 51:38.364
If you tell me,
I'll reduce your sentence.

51:39.480 --> 51:43.883
Those detention chains
could be much lighter.

51:44.320 --> 51:47.220
You can't buy us off like that no good,

51:47.320 --> 51:49.500
back stabbing, traitorous paintergeist!

51:49.600 --> 51:51.140
I'm sorry, ghoul.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.860
It doesn't matter.

51:52.960 --> 51:55.820
One way or another

51:55.920 --> 52:00.100
you will tell me what I need to know.

52:00.200 --> 52:02.820
What's that? What are you doing there?

52:02.920 --> 52:04.460
Taking notes.

52:04.560 --> 52:06.580
When all this is over, my ghoul,

52:06.680 --> 52:08.648
Spectra here, is gonna write a story

52:08.760 --> 52:12.207
telling the world what kind
of principal you really are.

52:13.200 --> 52:14.247
Hey!

52:16.200 --> 52:19.329
Wicked? Evil?

52:19.440 --> 52:22.922
My dear, you flatter me.

52:24.080 --> 52:25.650
Interesting.

52:25.920 --> 52:27.524
The Boogie Mansion.

52:28.080 --> 52:29.081
(PRINCIPAL REVENANT GASPS)

52:29.320 --> 52:31.243
Boogie sand.

52:31.640 --> 52:34.564
How very enlightening.

52:36.120 --> 52:40.045
Head to the Monster World
and get to the Boogie Mansion at once.

52:40.360 --> 52:42.340
And just how do you expect them
to get there

52:42.440 --> 52:44.681
without me to ferry them across?

52:44.960 --> 52:45.961
(SHIP ALARM CHIRPS)

52:48.240 --> 52:50.607
Well, that's annoying.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.685
I'm sorry my notes
gave away the boogie sand.

52:53.840 --> 52:55.900
I was just trying to help Spectra.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.540
No. This is my fault.

52:57.640 --> 53:00.100
I never should have opened
those windows to Monster High.

53:00.200 --> 53:01.820
Don't blame yourself, Kiyomi.

53:01.920 --> 53:04.940
If I hadn't been such a scaredy bat,

53:05.040 --> 53:06.500
Spectra wouldn't have come back

53:06.600 --> 53:08.204
to Haunted High in the first place.

53:08.320 --> 53:12.006
No. This is somebody else's fault.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.460
Spectra! Good, you're back.
We have to talk.

53:25.560 --> 53:27.420
Oh, you've got that right.

53:27.520 --> 53:30.205
I know you're all really angry at me,
but I can explain.

53:30.320 --> 53:32.900
Angry? Angry, doesn't even
begin to describe

53:33.000 --> 53:34.889
what we are feeling, paintergeist!

53:35.120 --> 53:36.660
I understand. But if you'll just...

53:36.760 --> 53:37.820
Oh, you understand?

53:37.920 --> 53:39.580
Must be pretty hard to understand

53:39.680 --> 53:41.170
when you've got paint for brains.

53:41.360 --> 53:42.486
Spectra, please.

53:42.680 --> 53:44.740
You know, it's one thing to hurt me,

53:44.840 --> 53:48.208
but what you did
affected all of my ghoul friends

53:48.320 --> 53:50.721
and that's a line
that you just don't cross!

53:51.040 --> 53:52.580
- But, I...
- We've heard enough.

53:52.680 --> 53:54.091
Go get him, little fish guy!

53:54.480 --> 53:55.527
Aye, aye!

53:57.360 --> 53:59.340
- CLAWDEEN: Uh-uh.
- TWYLA: Us ghouls stick together.

53:59.440 --> 54:01.820
- You don't talk like that to my friends!
- That's so wrong. Terribly bad!

54:01.920 --> 54:05.311
- Can I just show you something?
- This had better be good.

54:12.120 --> 54:13.804
Okay, that is pretty good.

54:14.840 --> 54:18.721
I had to make a deal with Revenant
so I could see how this key thing works.

54:18.960 --> 54:22.700
Then, I kind of borrowed it so I could
get you all out of detention.

54:22.800 --> 54:24.370
I don't know what to say.

54:24.800 --> 54:28.289
I figured out watching Revenant
that the detention chains can't be broken,

54:28.560 --> 54:31.500
only transferred to another ghost
using this key,

54:31.600 --> 54:34.060
so I set it to transfer them to me.

54:34.160 --> 54:37.180
Here. You can use this to free
the Monster High ghosts

54:37.280 --> 54:39.420
and take them back to the Monster World.

54:39.520 --> 54:42.410
You're just full of surprises,
aren't you?

54:42.680 --> 54:44.091
Yeah, I guess.

54:44.520 --> 54:45.500
Oh!

54:45.600 --> 54:47.602
Well, here's one more.

54:48.640 --> 54:49.641
Oh.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.201
Oh, Porter.

54:57.960 --> 55:01.601
I thought you might be able to use this,
you know, for writing.

55:01.840 --> 55:03.251
Do you like it?

55:04.080 --> 55:05.923
All right, then. (CHUCKLES)

55:07.640 --> 55:08.721
Cool.

55:09.760 --> 55:10.921
I'm okay!

55:16.600 --> 55:18.762
Maybe this is it.

55:23.360 --> 55:24.885
Huh. Nope.

55:26.600 --> 55:27.601
(GROWLS)

55:37.520 --> 55:38.521
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

55:40.960 --> 55:44.487
Principal Revenant,
we have the ghost sand.

55:44.600 --> 55:46.170
Excellent.

55:46.800 --> 55:50.460
Now, I just have one more job
for you and...

55:50.560 --> 55:53.643
I'm sorry, where's the ghost of Future?

55:53.800 --> 55:54.801
(LAUGHING)

55:55.120 --> 55:57.122
I don't want to talk about it.

55:57.880 --> 55:59.860
All right, ghouls. We all know the plan.

55:59.960 --> 56:02.220
Step one, we round up
all the Monster High

56:02.320 --> 56:04.380
ghosts and get rid of their chains.

56:04.480 --> 56:07.660
And quickly, before Ms. Revenant
realizes we have the key.

56:07.760 --> 56:10.380
Right. Step two, we take Vandala's ship
back to the Monster World

56:10.480 --> 56:12.420
and we get my dad's boogie sand back
from the Moanitors.

56:12.520 --> 56:16.060
And step three, we sail
the Salty Spectre to the Scaribbean

56:16.160 --> 56:19.960
in search of the legendary
sunken treasure of Davey Bones!

56:20.760 --> 56:25.140
Um, I'm thinking maybe we should just stick
to one adventure at a time.

56:25.240 --> 56:27.129
Yeah, you're probably right.

56:27.520 --> 56:29.522
- Sorry, Aye.
- Aye.

56:29.840 --> 56:32.844
All right, ghouls.
Let's rattle some chains.

56:36.920 --> 56:37.921
(GRUNTING)

56:42.000 --> 56:43.001
(GASPS)

56:43.480 --> 56:44.481
(CHUCKLES)

57:01.520 --> 57:02.681
- All right!
- Whoo-hoo!

57:10.360 --> 57:11.361
(SIGHS)

57:31.400 --> 57:33.402
All right, ghosts, follow me!

57:39.240 --> 57:40.651
All hands on deck!

57:40.760 --> 57:44.900
The Salty Spectre is ready
to set sail for Monster High!

57:45.000 --> 57:46.206
(ALL CHEERING)

57:47.240 --> 57:50.900
Vandala, can you wait for just a minute?

57:51.000 --> 57:53.500
- I need to see Porter.
- ALL: Aw!

57:53.600 --> 57:57.605
Calm down, I just need to say
thank you one more time.

57:57.720 --> 57:58.700
ALL: Aw!

57:58.800 --> 58:00.962
Stop that. I'll just be right back.

58:02.080 --> 58:03.081
ALL: Aw!

58:04.600 --> 58:05.647
Spectra!

58:05.760 --> 58:06.761
(GASPS)

58:07.120 --> 58:08.804
Don't you have a boat to catch?

58:09.280 --> 58:10.406
Oh, Porter.

58:12.200 --> 58:15.010
I just wanted to say thank you,

58:15.240 --> 58:16.446
for everything.

58:16.760 --> 58:20.128
Without you, all of my friends
would be stuck here.

58:20.800 --> 58:25.283
Hey, it was both of us, working together.
We make a pretty good duo.

58:25.800 --> 58:27.802
Yeah. We do.

58:28.040 --> 58:29.860
I promise I'll come back.

58:29.960 --> 58:33.328
You know, to break in
that freaky fabulous desk.

58:33.800 --> 58:37.740
And maybe one of these days I could
come see you at Monster High?

58:37.840 --> 58:38.887
I'd like that.

58:39.120 --> 58:42.761
You should probably
leave your paint cans here.

58:42.880 --> 58:45.645
PRINCIPAL REVENANT OVER PA:
Attention, students of Haunted High.

58:45.920 --> 58:51.484
Please report to the main hall
for a mandatory Spirit Rally.

58:51.800 --> 58:54.007
Spirit Rally?
What do you think that's about?

58:54.240 --> 58:55.685
Get out of here while you still can.

58:56.040 --> 58:59.300
I can't leave. I've got to find out
what Ms. Revenant is up to.

58:59.400 --> 59:00.640
Spectra, no!

59:01.840 --> 59:03.046
Man, these are heavy.

59:06.160 --> 59:07.161
Oh.

59:07.320 --> 59:09.561
Look at all those detention chains.

59:12.200 --> 59:14.060
Hello, students.

59:14.160 --> 59:15.780
ALL: Hello, Principal Revenant.

59:15.880 --> 59:21.540
For centuries we have lived
in fear of the outsiders.

59:21.640 --> 59:25.580
And now they have come
to our school to haunt us!

59:25.680 --> 59:26.806
To frighten us!

59:27.040 --> 59:28.087
(ALL BOOING)

59:28.200 --> 59:30.328
I know, I know.

59:30.680 --> 59:36.562
But I have a plan to keep all of you
safe from the outsiders,

59:36.960 --> 59:38.803
once and forever!

59:39.120 --> 59:40.929
ALL: Revenant! Revenant!

59:41.200 --> 59:42.440
As we speak,

59:42.680 --> 59:48.460
our noble Hall Moanitors
are traveling to Monster High.

59:48.560 --> 59:52.201
They are carrying
a special powder I created

59:52.400 --> 59:55.340
that will permanently transform

59:55.440 --> 59:58.569
all of the students into ghosts!

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.449
So that's why she wanted
the boogie sand?

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:03.120
And when they are ghosts,

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.844
I'll give them
well-deserved detention chains

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.780
as punishment
for sinister solid scheming.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.900
(ALL CHEERING)

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.731
As your principal always says,

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.926
"They'll never learn their lesson
if they don't pay the price."

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.407
STUDENTS: Yes, Principal Revenant!

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.700
No good solids!
Trying to take over our school!

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.140
They never wanted
to take over the school.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.846
I am sick of all these
rumors and gossip.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.460
Spectra! Where are you going?

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.660
I have to stop those Hall Moanitors!

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:47.740
How?

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.887
I have no idea!

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.601
(GRUNTING)

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.660
(SINGING)
Porter and Spectra, cracking the case

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:02.243
Something, something,
something all over the something

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.441
Porter!

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.721
(GROANS)

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.684
I'm so sorry! Your chains.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.841
(CHUCKLES)

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.241
(SIGHS)

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.020
VANDALA: (SINGING) Yo, ho! Yo, ho!
Is a thing that pirates say

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.180
We have to go!

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:29.780
But there's still 37 more verses.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.860
Now!

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.644
- Aye, aye!
- Aye, aye!

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.740
What is happening, Spectra?

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.220
It's Principal Revenant.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:44.847
She's sent the Hall Moanitors to Monster High
to turn everyone into ghosts.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.650
With my dad's boogie sand.

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:51.005
Then she wants to load them
with detention chains. Everybody.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.324
Wait. That's it.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.330
The chains. (GASPS)

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.489
This is all about the detention chains.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.171
It's like Porter said.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.166
"The chains can't be broken,
only transferred."

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.131
Principle Revenant wasn't
just wearing those chains.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.846
(GASPS) She's being punished by them.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.860
Um, Spectra! Monster High is that way!

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.200
I'm not going to Monster High.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.001
But you are! Do whatever you can
to stop those Hall Moanitors!

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.940
(SINGING)
Porter and Spectra, cracking the...

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.247
Hi, Spectra. Spectra?

(GASPS)

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.571

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.041
(GRUNTING)

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.020
Come on! That desk you fixed up

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.122
is going to get some use after all.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.041

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.085
We are running out of time.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.460
Can you not make this thing
go any faster, Vandala?

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:01.406
You heard the gargoyle. Full speed!

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.080
Uh-uh.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:11.564
Nope, looks like this is
as fast as she goes. Sorry!

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.860
Bad news. By the time
we get to Monster High,

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.291
we're going to be too late to stop them.

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.324
Unless... (GASPS)

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.842
Kiyomi, you could open a window!

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.405
We'd get there in no time!

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.965
Can you do it, Kiyomi?

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.980
Fangtastic!

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.660
- Let's move!
- Wait!

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:35.780
Aye. You're in charge
of the Salty Spectre while I'm away.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:36.860
Aye, aye!

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.530
Okay, now I'm ready.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.769

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.780
Before coming to Haunted High,

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.247
I never saw much harm
in reporting on rumors.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.820
They were just funny stories,

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.780
little tidbits of juicy gossip.

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.940
It was fun to join in with the crowd

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.380
and pass along the latest overheard
pieces of news.

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:42.723
But now I realize
how harmful rumors can be.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.940
There's a particularly nasty rumor

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.724
going around here at Haunted High

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.300
about how the so-called "outsiders"

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.300
want to come to your school
to frighten and scare you.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:58.820
It's not true, but this rumor
became so powerful, so real,

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.980
that it was able to convince
the entire school

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:05.801
to go along with Principal Revenant's
devious plan.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.140
And for what?

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:10.767
Because she really thinks the Monster High
students deserve detention?

(SCOFFS) No.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:15.806
All this is because she wants
to get rid of her own chains.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.163
And she has a lot of them
because Principal Revenant

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.524
is the Red Lady.

to give you all detention
