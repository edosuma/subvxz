in distance )

00:51.885 --> 00:53.754
( squeals )

01:03.131 --> 01:05.733
( laughing continues )

01:38.266 --> 01:41.202
I love it here.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.503
I know you do.

01:47.508 --> 01:50.878
I can feel my life,
you know?

02:26.514 --> 02:27.881
Sportscaster on radio:
Pitch to Hatteberg.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.684
Strike ball over the
outside corner, at the knees.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.686
Appeared a little upset
with the call

02:32.720 --> 02:35.823
by the home-plate umpire,
didn't appear to say anything.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.858
( continues indistinctly )

02:59.480 --> 03:01.815
( sportscast stops )

03:04.852 --> 03:07.688
- Hey.
- Woman: hey.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.623
Morning, Dr. Fowler.

03:09.657 --> 03:10.958
Morning, Natalie.
How you doing, boys?

03:10.991 --> 03:12.993
Great!

03:13.026 --> 03:15.896
Hey, Duncan,
sure you don't want to go?

03:15.929 --> 03:18.266
- Want to get in here?
- No, he wants to stay here.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.301
Scootch up.
Get in the middle there.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.971
Come on.
Bye, Dr. Fowler.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.373
- Bye.
- Bye!

03:25.406 --> 03:27.841
( laughing ) You don't
want to wave good-bye?

03:27.875 --> 03:29.943
You don't want to wave
good-bye?

03:29.977 --> 03:34.282
( laughs ) Sweetie, what do
you want for breakfast?

03:34.315 --> 03:36.016
Cereal.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.319
Sportscaster: The WEEI
Red Sox radio network.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.021
Announcer: You've been listening
to "Red Sox Replay."

03:41.054 --> 03:44.825
WQSS Camden's repeat broadcast
of Boston Red Sox baseball

03:44.858 --> 03:47.528
has been brought to you
by George C. Hall & Sons

03:47.561 --> 03:50.498
of Rockland in business
in mid-coast since 19...

03:56.404 --> 03:58.372
( foghorn blowing )

04:50.791 --> 04:53.561
( back-up signal beeping )

05:17.918 --> 05:18.986
There you go.

05:30.531 --> 05:33.534
( engine slowing )

06:07.735 --> 06:09.903
Oh, boy.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.673
You see what happened
to this poor fella?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.041
What?

06:14.074 --> 06:16.143
Well, look.
He lost an arm.

06:16.176 --> 06:20.581
See, the trap has nylon nets,
called heads,

06:20.614 --> 06:25.152
two side side heads
to let the lobster crawl in

06:25.185 --> 06:27.921
and inside, what they call
a bedroom head

06:27.955 --> 06:30.691
to hold the bait
and keeps him from escaping.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.159
Now you know the old saying

06:32.192 --> 06:34.895
"two's company,
three's a crowd"?

06:34.928 --> 06:36.530
Well, it's like that.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.966
You, uh, get more than
two of these in a bedroom

06:38.999 --> 06:41.869
and chances are something
like that's going to happen.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.871
That's why Frank can't
leave these traps

06:43.904 --> 06:45.038
for more than a day.

06:45.072 --> 06:48.175
Dad, show him this one.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.944
Now...

06:50.978 --> 06:53.881
the older females,
like this old gal

06:53.914 --> 06:55.949
they're the most dangerous,

06:55.983 --> 06:58.151
especially when they're
growing berries.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.152
Berries?

06:59.186 --> 07:00.788
Yeah, eggs. You see?

07:00.821 --> 07:03.957
She could take out
two males, no problem.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.760
That's when you get a lobster
you can't sell.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.663
But this fine lady,
she, uh, she has it easy

07:09.697 --> 07:13.033
'cause the state says
we have to let her go.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.003
( water splashes )

07:18.539 --> 07:23.176
Okay, now, you think
you can handle this?

07:23.210 --> 07:24.712
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you sure?

07:24.745 --> 07:27.915
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, go ahead.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.149
Put her in the tank.

07:30.150 --> 07:33.654
( chuckles ) Good.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.890
- Higher. Higher!
- Higher!

07:36.924 --> 07:39.259
I'll swing you higher.
Like that?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.994
- That high enough?
- ( sportscaster
talking indistinctly )

07:41.028 --> 07:42.162
Duncan: Yep.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.570
Aah, Ruth hates these.

07:49.603 --> 07:50.571
What?

07:50.604 --> 07:52.673
I got the wrong kind of buns.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.042
Maybe we can borrow hers.

07:55.075 --> 07:55.909
Two.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.912
You've had a lot, huh?
Here, sweetie.

07:58.946 --> 08:02.049
Ah, what I would give
to have back my youth.

08:02.082 --> 08:05.753
Yeah, well, Willis, you never
had that in your youth.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.788
You can go play.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.862
Hey, father, you made it.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.864
If I don't get to see
you fellas here,

08:16.897 --> 08:18.498
I don't get to see
you at all.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.003
Hey.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.304
Hey.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.706
You want a beer?

08:25.739 --> 08:27.808
No, I'm going to go see

08:27.841 --> 08:29.710
if your mom needs
any help, okay?

08:29.743 --> 08:31.178
- All right, good luck.
- Yeah.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.999
( knife chopping )

08:56.136 --> 08:57.571
Excuse me.

08:57.605 --> 08:59.306
Can I help you with
anything here?

08:59.339 --> 09:02.042
Oh, yes, you can
hand me that bowl, dear.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.210
Great.

09:03.243 --> 09:06.013
- Uh, this one here?
- ( water running in sink )

09:06.046 --> 09:07.981
Yes. Thank you.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.355
I'm looking forward
to that concert on Labor Day.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.826
The music's so unusual.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.161
It's haunting, really.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.030
It is, isn't it?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.297
Mmm.

09:26.800 --> 09:31.805
How did you learn about
that, uh, style?

09:31.839 --> 09:34.074
- At Brown.
- Ah.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.143
I did my thesis
on Eastern European folk music.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.278
Oh, I thought about
becoming a teacher.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.947
Oh, why didn't you?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.982
Mommy!

09:42.015 --> 09:43.951
Yeah? What are you eating?

09:43.984 --> 09:45.686
Nothing.

09:45.719 --> 09:46.987
Is it good?

09:47.020 --> 09:47.988
Yeah.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.990
Swing me.
Swing me.

09:50.023 --> 09:54.094
Okay, I'll swing you, Dunc.
I'll be right back.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.329
So, Mr. Strout mentioned
you again.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.330
I'll bet he did.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.799
He still talks about you.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.267
Says you're the best can-packer
he ever had.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.802
Yeah?

10:01.835 --> 10:03.637
Says you looked real cute in
that hair net.

10:03.671 --> 10:06.006
Excuse me, boys. An offering.
Here, father.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.107
Thank you.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.043
So that's what
Charles Sr.'s doing

10:10.077 --> 10:12.212
and, uh, Becky went
to the hairdressing academy

10:12.245 --> 10:14.081
after high school.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.083
Of course,
after she got married

10:16.116 --> 10:20.821
she decided she wanted to stay
home with the boys, you know.

10:20.854 --> 10:24.224
She still loves doing hair,
though.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.026
Where do you go, father?

10:26.059 --> 10:27.995
I just go to Supercuts.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.663
Wha?

10:29.697 --> 10:32.733
You can't request
the same girl at Supercuts.

10:32.766 --> 10:35.703
Man: I tell you, those boys
are having a great time.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.738
It was good of you
to do this for them.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.807
Well, she hasn't
brought them before

10:39.840 --> 10:41.074
because she's embarrassed.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.910
She shouldn't be embarrassed.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.045
I wish you hadn't put up
that monstrosity.

10:45.078 --> 10:48.381
We're just going to have to
take it apart when they leave.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.751
- What, the swing?
- The swing.

10:50.784 --> 10:53.453
Oh, Ruth, he's a kid.
What do you expect?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.723
"Happy birthday.
Here's a box.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.725
Drag it around for a while."

10:57.758 --> 11:00.260
He's a kid.
He's like me, he wants it now.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.031
( gasps )
Oh, the cake.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.172
Oh, great.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.979
Man on radio: Find solutions
to fit your unique goals

11:19.012 --> 11:21.381
and 3,500 New England
team members to help you...

11:21.414 --> 11:22.883
Hey, there, birthday boy,
come here!

11:22.916 --> 11:24.718
- Daddy, daddy!
- Yeah, Duncan!

11:24.752 --> 11:27.921
( laughs )
* Happy birthday to you

11:27.955 --> 11:29.222
* Happy birthday to you

11:29.256 --> 11:31.191
Hey.
* Happy birthday, dear Duncan

11:31.224 --> 11:33.126
* Happy birthday to you

11:33.160 --> 11:34.795
Mom, I don't want to go.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.197
* Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday to you *

11:37.230 --> 11:38.198
Mom, I don't want to go.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.900
Shit.
What is he doing here?

11:39.933 --> 11:41.802
* Dear Duncan
( growls playfully )

11:41.835 --> 11:44.972
* Happy birthday to you

11:45.005 --> 11:48.141
( grunts ) Hey, there, Jase.
Come on over here, buddy.

11:48.175 --> 11:51.511
Daddy's taking us
to the arcade.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.246
I told you he'd come,
buttface.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.748
( laughs )

11:54.782 --> 11:57.250
Hey, Jason, don't do that
to your brother.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.186
Want me to do that to you?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.822
We're supposed to meet
at the house at 6:30.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.391
- I thought we
were meeting here.
- Mnh-mnh.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.062
All right.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.998
You're welcome to stay
and have some food.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.465
My dad's cooking.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.071
( Sportscaster
talking on radio )

12:21.408 --> 12:26.246
Matt?

12:26.279 --> 12:28.315
Should we do something?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.150
No.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.052
It's okay.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.993
I'll, uh...

12:40.027 --> 12:41.461
I'll see you later, then.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.463
Okay.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.232
A little while.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.204
Oh...

12:53.373 --> 12:56.043
Ruth: She's not
divorced yet, you know.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.544
Matt: It's the same thing.

12:57.577 --> 13:00.013
Maine has crazy laws,
that's all.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.249
Anyway, he loves her boys.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.853
Oh, God, you don't think
he wants to--

13:05.886 --> 13:07.855
No, he's not going
to marry her.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.190
Well, then what's he
doing with her?

13:10.223 --> 13:12.059
She probably loves him.

13:12.092 --> 13:15.028
Girls always have.
Let's just leave it at that.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.998
( sighs )

13:18.031 --> 13:19.933
Well, he won't listen to me.

13:19.967 --> 13:23.370
I've asked him three times
to dismantle that swing set.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.571
Oh, leave it up.

13:24.604 --> 13:27.074
Looks like a young
couple lives here.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.010
( laughs )

13:30.043 --> 13:33.914
Well, he needs his head
in school not in her.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.349
So to speak.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.319
- ( shocked gasp )
- Ow.

13:39.352 --> 13:43.323
It would help if you
were on my side.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.026
Oh, I can be on your side.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.427
( chuckling )

13:47.460 --> 13:51.398
- I've got a needle.
- Here I come, ready or not.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.100
- I've got a needle.
- You don't need those.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.179
( tone beeps )

14:06.213 --> 14:09.249
Mr. And Mrs. Adamson?

14:09.282 --> 14:12.585
Okay, you can put your shirt
back on now.

14:12.619 --> 14:17.290
Yesterday, he was up
and around all afternoon,

14:17.324 --> 14:19.659
but today he tumbled.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.328
He's fallen twice.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.497
I have all I can do
to get him up.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.499
He's weak.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.601
Said when he couldn't
work no more,

14:28.635 --> 14:29.669
he didn't want to live.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.040
For a while, he sat
and just mended our nets

14:33.073 --> 14:35.042
but he can't do that no more.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.376
How's your dad, Matt?

14:36.409 --> 14:38.111
Oh, I'm sorry, doctor.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.512
Now, Elwyn, you remember,

14:39.546 --> 14:43.016
Jesse Fowler passed away
a while ago.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.252
We were at his funeral,
remember?

14:45.285 --> 14:46.954
( fax machine dialing )

14:46.987 --> 14:49.089
Back in an hour, Janelle.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.423
Uh, forgot my lunch.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.993
Starting to become a habit.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.167
You just missed him, Matt.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.369
He went home for lunch today.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.937
Oh, right.

15:03.971 --> 15:06.106
I forgot,
he's got an interview.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.207
( door closes )

15:07.240 --> 15:09.642
Frank?

15:09.676 --> 15:11.711
Hello?

15:11.744 --> 15:14.081
Hey, Frank!

15:14.114 --> 15:18.018
Yeah, dad?

15:18.051 --> 15:19.119
What are you doing here?

15:19.152 --> 15:22.389
I thought you were driving
to Boston for the interview.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.092
Yeah. No, it was rescheduled.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.594
- Uh-huh.
- ( footsteps approaching )

15:27.627 --> 15:30.663
Hi, Dr. Fowler.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.499
Oh, hi.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.067
Uh, where are the boys?

15:34.101 --> 15:39.039
Um, they're with my mom.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.711
Um...

15:44.744 --> 15:46.980
do you like coleslaw?

15:53.086 --> 15:54.554
Mm-mmm.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.325
Have some more.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.394
Sure?

16:16.276 --> 16:18.311
I got 'em.

16:18.345 --> 16:21.014
Put your clothes on.

16:21.048 --> 16:22.715
Hands up.
Chin up.

16:22.749 --> 16:28.055
- Mom, I want to play.
- All right, all right.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.290
- Hey, mom, there's Frank.
- Here's your hat.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.462
Wave, you guys.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.130
Mom, hurry up. I'm late.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.766
I'm hurrying.
I'm hurrying. I'm hurrying.

16:39.799 --> 16:43.136
You'll play too,
but first, we'll watch him.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.604
Hey, Frank.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.274
Did you tell your mom
how good it was?

16:47.307 --> 16:48.675
How good what was?

16:48.708 --> 16:52.645
Aw, Frank had quite a time
this afternoon.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.448
Loved your coleslaw.
Ate enough for two.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.117
Well, that's what it's for.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.254
- Hot dogs?
- Yeah, I'll take one.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.355
No.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.729
So, how are the kids?

17:09.762 --> 17:12.098
Things okay?

17:12.132 --> 17:13.566
Yeah, they're fine.

17:13.599 --> 17:16.435
Good. That's good.

17:16.469 --> 17:19.439
Oh, how was your interview?

17:19.472 --> 17:21.574
It was-- it was--
it was great.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.611
Good.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.479
Jason!

17:26.512 --> 17:28.281
( singsongy ) Jason.

17:31.118 --> 17:33.153
She's such a brave girl.

17:33.186 --> 17:36.123
That's it.
You're driving me nuts, ma.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.824
I've had lots of girlfriends

17:37.857 --> 17:41.461
and I don't understand
why this one is any different.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.163
I know you don't.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.801
We're not serious, ma.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.705
No?

17:52.739 --> 17:53.773
No.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.745
It's a summer thing.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.513
Mmm, I see.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.144
How'd you get in this time?

18:31.178 --> 18:32.212
Chimney.

18:43.923 --> 18:47.227
Thank you.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.728
What can I help you with?

18:50.397 --> 18:52.399
I was just dropping
that off for Jason.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.234
What?

18:54.267 --> 18:55.902
That.

18:55.935 --> 19:00.440
I didn't know where
you'd want to put it.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.442
It's about time he got it.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.444
What am I going to do
with it?

19:04.477 --> 19:06.513
It is really going to mean
a lot to him, rich.

19:06.546 --> 19:07.847
He's really been
improving lately.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.482
Yeah, so I heard.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.586
Would have been nice
if you'd come to his game.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.255
I just got your message.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.159
Where are they, with him?

19:22.495 --> 19:23.930
That's none of your business.

19:23.963 --> 19:27.834
I see, they're my boys, but
they're none of my business.

19:27.867 --> 19:31.204
You know what I mean.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.206
Yeah.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.741
( clears throat )

19:34.774 --> 19:36.743
I was thinking
about moving back,

19:36.776 --> 19:39.178
here with you and the boys.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.916
What are you talking about?

19:43.950 --> 19:45.852
What am I talking about?

19:45.885 --> 19:49.256
I'm talking about moving back
is what I'm talking about.

19:49.289 --> 19:52.825
I know what you're thinking.
It's different now.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.694
Yeah?

19:54.727 --> 19:56.195
Yeah.

19:57.597 --> 19:58.765
How's the job?

19:58.798 --> 20:00.633
Your father take you
back on at the cannery?

20:00.667 --> 20:02.402
That's funny.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.437
Still getting checks,
aren't you?

20:04.471 --> 20:07.274
Or do I have to call
my father's accountant?

20:10.543 --> 20:13.580
Hey, did you see my
new rig out there?

20:13.613 --> 20:14.981
It's really nice.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.716
It's not exactly new.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.785
I traded David
the truck for it.

20:18.818 --> 20:22.455
It's got room for all of us.
Good grocery-getting car.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.660
You want to take a ride?

20:27.694 --> 20:30.597
Rich, you don't change.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.265
You don't change, do you?

20:35.468 --> 20:37.904
Change? No.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.940
No, I don't change.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.009
Everything around me changes.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.812
You change.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.448
You take my house

20:48.481 --> 20:51.318
and you take my kids

20:51.351 --> 20:53.353
and you fuck this other guy

20:53.386 --> 20:56.489
but me,
I don't change at all.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.491
It's not your house.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.859
Oh, really?

20:59.892 --> 21:03.062
No, as far as
( whispers ) fucking goes

21:03.095 --> 21:04.497
who was it that answered
the phone the other morning?

21:04.531 --> 21:05.598
She just--

21:05.632 --> 21:07.300
It doesn't matter.
I don't care.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.035
It's not working.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.971
Nat...

21:12.004 --> 21:16.376
I just want a chance.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.977
For what?

21:18.010 --> 21:19.612
So you can pretend
they have a real father

21:19.646 --> 21:22.749
- for a few days, and then--
- I am their real father!

21:22.782 --> 21:24.884
I am their father.

21:24.917 --> 21:28.488
No, Richard.
You know what defines a father?

21:28.521 --> 21:31.057
It's what he does.
Not what he promises.

21:31.090 --> 21:35.495
It's being a positive,
consistent presence.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.597
( chuckling )

21:40.733 --> 21:43.903
A positive,
consistent presence.

21:43.936 --> 21:44.904
Wow.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.073
What does that mean?

21:47.106 --> 21:49.075
I just don't get it.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.944
But then I'm not fucking
a college boy, am I?

21:54.547 --> 21:57.417
Look, uh--

21:57.450 --> 21:58.685
can you just go now?

21:58.718 --> 22:00.887
I don't want you here
when they get back.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.890
Oh, you wouldn't want that?

22:03.923 --> 22:05.958
- No.
- No.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.627
No, you have to leave now.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.967
Okay.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.936
I'll see you later, Richard.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.538
Yeah. Good-bye, Nat.

22:36.623 --> 22:40.059
Hey.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.862
You know, I've been ignoring
our difference in age

22:42.895 --> 22:44.764
but you keep playing
with those blocks,

22:44.797 --> 22:47.066
I'm going to start to worry.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.470
You're not looking
at the house.

22:50.503 --> 22:51.971
Look.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.647
It's not all mine.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.715
It's part Mack.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.984
See, the whole idea
of what Mack was trying

23:05.017 --> 23:08.588
to achieve was a common area
in the center of the house.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.491
I mean, large open spaces,
they weren't unique to Mack,

23:11.524 --> 23:13.493
but the idea of separating
the family

23:13.526 --> 23:16.463
so that the parents
were on one side

23:16.496 --> 23:18.865
and the kids are
on the other,

23:18.898 --> 23:21.067
so they'll all spill
into the center.

23:21.100 --> 23:24.571
It's brilliant.
It's...

23:24.604 --> 23:26.673
I'm boring you,
aren't I?

23:26.706 --> 23:30.843
No. Mnh-mnh.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.979
I was just thinking.

23:36.983 --> 23:39.652
About what?

23:39.686 --> 23:41.087
About you.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.857
School.

23:49.161 --> 23:52.465
What if I wait a year?

23:54.634 --> 23:57.036
Frank...

23:57.069 --> 23:59.939
- A year is not going to make--
- No, you can't do that, Frank.

23:59.972 --> 24:04.944
Why not?
I've thought a lot about this.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.113
I have, and...

24:07.146 --> 24:09.849
No, y--

24:09.882 --> 24:12.619
you told me it takes forever
just to establish yourself.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.722
Exactly. So what's a year
in forever?

24:22.995 --> 24:24.997
That's twisted logic.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.802
Do you know what Duncan
said to me today?

24:29.836 --> 24:33.806
Oh, you wouldn't be changing
the subject, would you?

24:33.840 --> 24:36.242
He said,
"Frank, I don't think Jason

24:36.275 --> 24:38.210
really understands girls."

24:38.244 --> 24:39.946
Oh, he didn't.

24:39.979 --> 24:40.913
He did.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.549
( both laughing )

24:42.582 --> 24:44.083
"Understands girls."

24:46.819 --> 24:48.220
Well, what'd you say?

24:48.254 --> 24:50.056
I didn't know what
to say to that.

24:50.089 --> 24:53.726
I said, "Give him time, Duncan.
He'll come around."

24:55.795 --> 24:58.097
If this is how he is now,
then we're in trouble.

25:16.215 --> 25:19.852
What is this, Action Man?

25:19.886 --> 25:23.590
Yeah. Richard gave it
to Dunc for his birthday.

25:36.102 --> 25:40.039
( women singing
Balkan folk song )

26:01.994 --> 26:03.996
Very good.

26:04.030 --> 26:07.634
Okay, it's 7:30.
We should stop now.

26:07.667 --> 26:10.369
Now remember when
you sing these words

26:10.402 --> 26:12.004
the way we feel
about the harbor

26:12.038 --> 26:15.107
is how the Balkans felt
about the River Sava.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.009
And listen to your tapes!

26:17.043 --> 26:19.345
"Mmollih ta"
is still very rough,

26:19.378 --> 26:22.114
and we've got
a 40-minute program

26:22.148 --> 26:24.951
to have ready by Labor Day.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.253
Labor Day.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.788
Oh, and Anna?

26:28.821 --> 26:29.889
Yeah, Ms. Fowler?

26:29.922 --> 26:31.624
Next time, duck.

26:31.658 --> 26:34.126
Yoo-hoo.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.396
Yeah. Great.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.766
( groaning )

26:39.799 --> 26:42.068
Dad... is that acid?

26:42.101 --> 26:43.936
What are you putting in there?

26:43.970 --> 26:46.138
Oh, my God.
What happened?

26:46.172 --> 26:48.140
Come on, Frank.
Hold still.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.241
All right, dad.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.077
This was her husband,
wasn't it?

26:51.110 --> 26:53.012
Ex. He dropped in.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.047
You going to press charges?

26:55.081 --> 26:56.315
No.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.217
Well, what's to stop him
from doing it again?

26:58.250 --> 26:59.018
Did you hit him at all?

26:59.051 --> 27:01.087
Come on, tell me tell me
you hit him.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.021
- Matt.
- Just so
he doesn't do it again.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.657
I don't think I touched him.
Aah! Jesus, Dad.

27:04.691 --> 27:07.259
So what are you going to do?

27:07.293 --> 27:09.028
Take karate?

27:09.061 --> 27:10.797
Oh, that is not the problem.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.032
Mom, you know you like her.

27:13.065 --> 27:15.668
I like a lot of people,
Frank.

27:15.702 --> 27:17.704
What about the boys,
did they see it?

27:17.737 --> 27:19.371
No, they were asleep.

27:19.405 --> 27:22.041
Did you leave
her alone with him?

27:22.074 --> 27:25.111
He left first.
She was yelling at him.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.079
I believe she had
a skillet in her hand.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.782
Oh, for God sakes.
Did you call the police?

27:29.816 --> 27:31.083
Not yet.

27:31.117 --> 27:33.419
- You didn't call them?
- Well, I just got in.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.021
When did I have chance
to call the police?

27:35.054 --> 27:37.924
- Where's the phone book?
- No, mom, no, don't call them.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.225
If you call the police,
they'll come over

27:39.258 --> 27:40.893
- and scare the kids.
- Matt?

27:40.927 --> 27:43.229
- We got to call them.
- No, we're not calling them.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.331
It was a scuffle.
That's it. It wasn't serious.

27:45.364 --> 27:48.434
Oh, right, just like the
relationship isn't serious.

27:48.467 --> 27:51.137
Oh, Ruth.
Now is not the time.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.139
Well, when is the time, after
he knocks him into a coma?

27:53.172 --> 27:55.141
This is stopping now.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.009
Oh, really?

27:57.043 --> 27:59.078
Come fall,
you're on a plane.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.380
Are you taking them with you?

28:01.413 --> 28:04.116
What are the boys going to think
when you just disappear?

28:04.150 --> 28:05.952
Hey, easy, mom.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.855
Frank, this is not some
sweetie from Vassar

28:08.888 --> 28:10.823
that you can visit
on holidays.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.358
You're not in this alone.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.961
And the sooner you end it,
the better.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.232
( quietly ) Oh, God.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.769
What are we going to do?

28:22.802 --> 28:25.772
I don't know.

28:25.805 --> 28:29.075
Well, you've got
to talk to him, Matt.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.777
( sighs )

28:30.810 --> 28:33.780
I don't know.

28:33.813 --> 28:36.983
Maybe he's right about
scaring the kids.

28:37.016 --> 28:39.518
Why don't we
just sleep on it,

28:39.551 --> 28:41.420
deal with it tomorrow?

28:41.453 --> 28:43.956
Are you going to call
the police, or do I have to?

28:43.990 --> 28:45.124
I just told you what I think.

28:45.157 --> 28:47.426
If you want to call them,
call them.

29:09.315 --> 29:12.084
It's not the first time
she's played around, you know.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.921
She's not with the guy anymore.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.088
No, I mean from before.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.824
What are you talking about?

29:17.857 --> 29:20.359
Oh, come on, you've heard
the same things I have.

29:20.392 --> 29:21.828
You seem to forget.

29:21.861 --> 29:24.163
I don't take my lunches
in the teachers' lounge.

29:31.838 --> 29:34.040
Maybe he still loves her.

29:37.844 --> 29:40.847
Best part of the cod.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.148
The outsiders,
they won't touch it.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.150
Summer fishermen--

29:44.183 --> 29:46.452
well, the part-timers
like Frank here--

29:46.485 --> 29:47.987
get in your hair.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.122
As many as 80 of them
now with licenses.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.158
Hmm.
Should've put up a sign.

29:52.191 --> 29:55.094
"Stay in your own backyard,
or lose your traps."

29:55.127 --> 29:57.296
See, Henry here
is just sore

29:57.329 --> 29:58.998
'cause I catch about
twice as much as he does

29:59.031 --> 30:01.000
with an old second-hand
Boudreau.

30:01.033 --> 30:04.036
Don't you listen to him, son.
That boat is fine.

30:04.070 --> 30:06.372
She was my first.

30:06.405 --> 30:10.009
I kind of miss her,
sometimes.

30:10.042 --> 30:12.311
And that truck
you're driving.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.914
When are you headed back
to school, Frank?

30:14.947 --> 30:16.082
Hmm?

30:16.115 --> 30:18.117
( laughing )

30:31.163 --> 30:33.165
Hi, Dr. Fowler.

30:33.199 --> 30:34.466
How you doing, Jason?

30:34.500 --> 30:35.601
Good.

30:45.945 --> 30:48.014
What'd you pull?

30:48.047 --> 30:50.549
Not too bad.

30:50.582 --> 30:53.419
About 40 pounds.

30:53.452 --> 30:56.422
I haven't caught sight
of you in days.

30:56.455 --> 30:57.990
You know where to find me.

30:58.024 --> 31:01.027
When are you coming home?

31:01.060 --> 31:03.095
Has it come to this?

31:03.129 --> 31:05.264
Come to what?

31:05.297 --> 31:08.867
You having to run errands
for mom.

31:12.939 --> 31:15.307
I'm thinking of building
a couple hundred more traps,

31:15.341 --> 31:18.344
see if I can do better
than break even.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.112
Take you more than two years

31:20.146 --> 31:22.548
to get a license
to fish off-season.

31:22.581 --> 31:25.084
Right. Unless Henry takes me
on as his sternman.

31:25.117 --> 31:27.119
You think he'd do that?

31:27.153 --> 31:28.654
Maybe.

31:28.687 --> 31:32.191
It's as good a life as any.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.460
It was good enough
for your father

31:34.493 --> 31:37.496
and sometimes things
just skip a generation.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.235
You don't think--

31:43.269 --> 31:46.405
you don't think you
might need something more?

31:46.438 --> 31:48.374
Why?

31:48.407 --> 31:51.978
so I can have an Ivy League
education like you, and...

31:52.011 --> 31:55.447
Christ, if it's so great,
how come you sneak

31:55.481 --> 31:58.184
out of the office
every day to come down here?

32:00.519 --> 32:03.655
I like spending time
with my son.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.024
Uh-huh.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.040
I don't know, dad.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.979
It's just--
I don't know.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.184
She's a wonderful girl.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.089
And that's what I see.

32:43.229 --> 32:45.031
Hey, Frank!

32:45.064 --> 32:46.432
How long you gonna
be parked there?

32:46.465 --> 32:48.400
I'd like to unload!

32:48.434 --> 32:50.136
Give me a hand?

32:50.169 --> 32:51.470
Yeah, sure.

33:02.381 --> 33:07.153
You can't hypnotize the cards
into changing, Matt.

33:07.186 --> 33:10.056
For Chrissake, bet,
or you know Carl's gonna start.

33:10.089 --> 33:13.059
The begger's dog
and the widow's cat.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.094
Feed them
and thou wilt grow fat.

33:15.127 --> 33:18.064
The gnat sings
his summer's song.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.399
Poison gets
from slander's tongue.

33:20.432 --> 33:23.269
The poison of the snake
and newt

33:23.302 --> 33:25.804
is the sweat of envy's foot.

33:25.837 --> 33:29.275
The poison of the honeybee
is the artist's jealousy.

33:29.308 --> 33:32.611
All right, Carl.
Two bucks.

33:32.644 --> 33:35.414
I'll tell you, man, you got
to get out of this Blake thing.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.149
You're in a rut.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.617
Don't get him started,
Matt.

33:38.650 --> 33:41.387
Whenever I do my own stuff,
you guys bitch and moan.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.489
- That's not true!
- We love your stuff.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.325
- It's great stuff, right?
- ( laughter )

33:46.358 --> 33:47.626
Carl?

33:47.659 --> 33:48.727
I'm in.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.762
Everybody in?
Frankie, you in?

33:55.434 --> 33:57.103
( all groaning )

33:57.136 --> 33:58.437
Guess I'm the winner.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.771
Always the quiet ones.

33:59.805 --> 34:02.108
Deal.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.076
Come on. Come on.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.193
Don't mind me.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.228
Your father's snoring.

34:27.498 --> 34:29.400
( sniffs ) Ugh...

34:42.614 --> 34:44.315
Eat.

34:44.350 --> 34:46.452
You must be hungry.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.620
I'm not hungry.

34:48.654 --> 34:50.556
Coffee?

34:57.496 --> 34:59.765
So you talked to her?

34:59.798 --> 35:02.268
Yeah.

35:05.237 --> 35:07.806
And how is she?

35:07.839 --> 35:09.708
She's great.

35:13.412 --> 35:17.816
Frank, I just I just
wanted to tell you that we--

35:17.849 --> 35:19.785
that I liked her.

35:19.818 --> 35:21.720
Do like her.

35:21.753 --> 35:24.790
She's a wonderful girl.

35:24.823 --> 35:27.159
Ma, you're not really
going to have this conversation

35:27.193 --> 35:29.228
with me right now,
are you?

35:40.539 --> 35:42.808
- Good night.
- Good night.

35:47.946 --> 35:49.781
Okay. All right.
No, that's fine, sir.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.684
I'll send it to you
right away.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.453
Okay.

35:54.486 --> 35:55.887
Oh, yes, I'm very excited.

35:55.921 --> 35:57.856
I'm, uh--

35:57.889 --> 36:00.559
it's a beautiful campus,
and I'm--

36:00.592 --> 36:02.861
I'm, uh, preparing already.

36:02.894 --> 36:06.832
Yes. Oh, thank you.
Thank you, sir.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.868
Yes, well,
compared to your models--

36:09.901 --> 36:12.904
it doesn't compare to your
models, but...

36:12.938 --> 36:16.642
I am.
I'm aware of the Lautner House.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.644
Yeah.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.647
Excuse me, sir,
can you hold on one second?

36:21.680 --> 36:24.316
( beep )

36:24.350 --> 36:26.918
Hello?

36:26.952 --> 36:29.221
Jase?

36:29.255 --> 36:31.457
Jase, what is it?

36:35.694 --> 36:37.863
Okay, Jason, stay put.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.532
I'll be right there.
Stay put.

36:40.566 --> 36:43.402
Natalie: He just, um...

36:43.435 --> 36:47.239
he just pushed me,
he didn't hit me.

36:47.273 --> 36:48.874
He didn't hit you.
That's great.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.909
We should throw a party for him.
He didn't hit you.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.711
Frank.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.780
That's enough of this.
We're calling the police.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.014
No, w-w-w-w-w-wait,
wait-- uh-uh.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.649
Natalie,
we're calling the police.

36:57.683 --> 37:00.018
No, no, I don't--
I don't know what I want to do.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.820
I don't-- I hate this.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.622
I hate the kids seeing this.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.657
I-- I don't know what to do.

37:05.691 --> 37:08.026
( sobbing )

37:08.059 --> 37:09.961
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

37:09.995 --> 37:14.566
I'm here now. I'm here now.
It's all right.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.967
I'm not going anywhere.

37:16.001 --> 37:18.604
Okay.

37:18.637 --> 37:22.040
It's all right.

37:22.073 --> 37:26.011
Okay, okay.

37:26.044 --> 37:26.978
Mom!

37:27.012 --> 37:28.680
Oh!

37:28.714 --> 37:30.716
( pounding on door )

37:30.749 --> 37:35.020
Go upstairs with the kids.

37:35.053 --> 37:36.322
No. I'm afraid.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.656
Natalie, go upstairs!

37:37.689 --> 37:39.057
I'm not letting him in
the house! Go upstairs!

37:39.090 --> 37:41.593
No. Uh-uh.

37:41.627 --> 37:42.994
It's better if
he doesn't see you.

37:43.028 --> 37:44.363
Go upstairs.

37:44.396 --> 37:45.897
Don't let him in.
Don't let him in.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.766
- Go.
- Frank, don't let him in.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.436
Richard: Open the door!

37:52.371 --> 37:56.808
Frank? Frank, buddy,
you in there?

37:56.842 --> 37:59.845
Frank, I'm really sorry about
what happened, all right?

37:59.878 --> 38:02.848
I apologize.
I'm sorry about what happened.

38:02.881 --> 38:04.049
Now open the door.

38:04.082 --> 38:07.486
Richard, leave.
Leave now!

38:07.519 --> 38:08.887
I'm not letting you
in this door.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.522
She left.
Natalie is gone.

38:10.556 --> 38:12.458
She's not here,
and I'm calling the police

38:12.491 --> 38:14.426
if you don't leave.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.094
Just go.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.330
All right.
All right.

38:35.046 --> 38:40.752
( rattling )

38:40.786 --> 38:42.020
Motherfucker!

38:42.053 --> 38:43.389
Read him a story.

38:43.422 --> 38:44.890
I'll be right back, okay?

38:44.923 --> 38:46.024
I don't want to stay here!

38:46.057 --> 38:48.594
You have to.
You have to stay here.

38:48.627 --> 38:49.995
You have to stay here.
Look at me.

38:50.028 --> 38:52.698
You're staying here, okay?
Read him a story.

38:52.731 --> 38:53.999
Jason:
Clock, clock, tick-tock.

38:54.032 --> 38:56.101
Where's the clock?
What time is it?

38:56.134 --> 38:58.370
You're fucking lying!
Where is she? Natalie!

38:58.404 --> 39:00.539
Put that away!
Put that away!

39:00.572 --> 39:01.773
( gunshot )

39:01.807 --> 39:03.041
( screams )

39:11.683 --> 39:13.685
No!

39:13.719 --> 39:18.857
( sobbing ) No!

39:18.890 --> 39:20.726
( running footsteps )

39:20.759 --> 39:22.761
Mommy!

39:26.732 --> 39:28.967
( intercom beeps )

39:29.000 --> 39:31.036
Woman: Matt, there's a
Mrs. Strout on line two.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.904
She says
it's very important.

39:34.706 --> 39:35.974
Hello?

39:38.109 --> 39:39.545
Hello, Natalie?

39:42.013 --> 39:45.684
( choir singing haunting
Balkan folk song )

39:54.125 --> 39:57.128
( singing continues )

40:17.983 --> 40:19.084
Great.

40:28.226 --> 40:29.995
Priest: Your fear of death

40:30.028 --> 40:32.664
is but the trembling
of the shepherd

40:32.698 --> 40:34.800
when he stands
before the king

40:34.833 --> 40:37.936
whose hand is to be
laid upon him in honor.

40:37.969 --> 40:42.040
Is the shepherd not joyful
beneath his trembling

40:42.073 --> 40:44.810
that he should wear
the mark of the king?

40:44.843 --> 40:48.480
Yet is he not more mindful
of his trembling?

40:48.514 --> 40:50.716
For what is it to die

40:50.749 --> 40:53.752
but to stand naked
in the wind

40:53.785 --> 40:56.087
and to melt into the sun?

40:56.121 --> 40:58.490
and what is it
to cease breathing

40:58.524 --> 41:02.694
but to free the breath
from its restless tides

41:02.728 --> 41:08.199
that it may rise and expand
and see god unencumbered?

41:08.233 --> 41:11.803
Only when you drink
from the river of silence

41:11.837 --> 41:13.605
shall you indeed sing.

41:13.639 --> 41:16.074
and when you have reached
the mountaintop

41:16.107 --> 41:19.177
then you shall begin
to climb.

41:19.210 --> 41:22.681
And when the earth
shall claim your limbs

41:22.714 --> 41:25.551
then shall you truly dance.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.989
( subdued indistinct
conversation )

41:47.105 --> 41:48.874
( laughing )

42:17.769 --> 42:19.104
Can I get you anything?

42:21.339 --> 42:25.611
Uh... where's Ruth?

42:25.644 --> 42:27.579
She went to lie down, Matt.

42:30.649 --> 42:32.017
Excuse me.

44:42.113 --> 44:43.715
( applause on television )

44:43.749 --> 44:46.484
Man: My next guest is
a very talented funnyman

44:46.517 --> 44:49.320
who will be performing live
at the end of the month

44:49.354 --> 44:52.323
at the Montreal Comedy Festival
"Just for Laughs."

44:52.357 --> 44:54.325
Please welcome
Anthony Clark!

44:54.359 --> 44:56.361
( cheers and applause )

45:05.170 --> 45:06.304
Clark: Wow.

45:06.337 --> 45:07.305
Host: How we doing?

45:07.338 --> 45:10.876
They're so nice. Wow.

45:10.909 --> 45:12.878
- They're good people.
- They really are.

45:12.911 --> 45:15.180
Some of them were packing,
but we've cleared that up.

45:15.213 --> 45:16.915
- That's good.
- So what's been going on?

45:16.948 --> 45:19.017
Well, you know,
I've actually

45:19.050 --> 45:21.052
been out with Ricky Martin,
livin' the vida loca.

45:21.086 --> 45:22.754
( laughter )

45:22.788 --> 45:24.022
You know Ricky?

45:24.055 --> 45:25.791
Actually, when you hang out
with Ricky,

45:25.824 --> 45:27.759
a lot of people want
to speak Spanish to you.

45:27.793 --> 45:29.027
And I think that's cool.

45:29.060 --> 45:35.500
I took three years
of Spanish in high school...

45:47.478 --> 45:49.480
( lawnmower in distance )

46:04.595 --> 46:06.932
( knock on door )

46:08.934 --> 46:10.101
( knock on door )

46:10.135 --> 46:12.437
Yeah?

46:12.470 --> 46:16.842
Matt, I'm going to
go to lunch.

46:16.875 --> 46:18.076
Okay.

46:18.109 --> 46:20.411
Can I get you anything?

46:23.148 --> 46:26.084
No, I'm fine.

46:26.117 --> 46:27.919
Are you sure?

46:30.421 --> 46:35.861
Yeah, I'm-- I'm okay.

46:35.894 --> 46:37.428
Okay.

46:54.045 --> 46:56.147
( dinnerware clattering )

47:01.119 --> 47:03.922
Don't worry,
I didn't make them.

47:05.490 --> 47:06.858
I wanted the cheese.

47:06.892 --> 47:10.028
What? Oh. That's mine.

47:10.061 --> 47:12.397
( chuckles ) Sorry.

47:19.270 --> 47:21.506
You got back to work
so quick, Matt.

47:21.539 --> 47:22.908
It's not too soon?

47:22.941 --> 47:26.344
I can't stay home.

47:26.377 --> 47:27.612
So, how's business?

47:27.645 --> 47:29.414
Oh, you know, same old crap.

47:29.447 --> 47:32.117
Got held up again.
Well, you knew that.

47:32.150 --> 47:33.919
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah.

47:33.952 --> 47:36.287
They got 75 bucks.

47:36.321 --> 47:38.023
Were you on the till?

47:38.056 --> 47:40.558
They'd have gotten something
else if I'd been on the till.

47:40.591 --> 47:42.193
( both chuckle )

47:45.430 --> 47:48.433
So, how you doing, Matt?
You don't write, you don't call.

47:48.466 --> 47:50.035
Where'd the love go?

47:50.068 --> 47:51.569
Nag, nag, nag.

47:51.602 --> 47:53.071
( chuckling )

48:01.146 --> 48:03.414
They set the
bail hearing yet?

48:03.448 --> 48:07.318
Uh, sometime in
the next few days, yeah.

48:07.352 --> 48:08.486
Are you going?

48:08.519 --> 48:11.189
I don't know.

48:13.724 --> 48:17.929
Davis says it's
a formality, really.

48:17.963 --> 48:19.497
I haven't talked with Ruth

48:19.530 --> 48:21.666
about whether or not
she thinks we ought to go.

48:21.699 --> 48:24.569
If it's too much for Ruth,
I'll come with you.

48:24.602 --> 48:25.670
Thanks.

48:25.703 --> 48:28.206
Uh, it'll be all right.

48:29.707 --> 48:32.210
Davis says it's
a formality, really.

48:34.145 --> 48:37.148
The criminal trial set yet?

48:39.584 --> 48:41.552
Uh, October.

48:41.586 --> 48:42.553
October?.

48:42.587 --> 48:44.055
That's what they tell me.

48:44.089 --> 48:47.392
Christ, they take their time.

48:47.425 --> 48:49.160
Well, he's in there now.

48:49.194 --> 48:52.130
They're keeping him busy,
I'm sure.

48:52.163 --> 48:53.631
You know where they'll
move him, once he's sentenced?

48:56.201 --> 48:58.203
Got any, uh, Tabasco?

49:01.039 --> 49:03.741
Hey, Anita! Tabasco!

49:03.774 --> 49:06.244
Hey!

49:06.277 --> 49:08.113
Aw, shit.

49:26.564 --> 49:28.099
Next weekend, Matt,

49:28.133 --> 49:30.368
we really want you to
come up to the camp.

49:30.401 --> 49:32.370
Katie's insisting.

49:32.403 --> 49:35.206
Not to pressure you or anything,
but if you don't come

49:35.240 --> 49:37.308
she's going to invite her
sister and that idiot

49:37.342 --> 49:39.577
and I'm going to wind up
insulting him again.

49:39.610 --> 49:43.081
The future of my family
is in your hands.

49:43.114 --> 49:46.217
Uh... let me ask Ruth.

49:48.486 --> 49:50.121
Woman on television:
so the combination of spices

49:50.155 --> 49:52.090
is very Southern,
and I'll tell you

49:52.123 --> 49:54.192
what makes it Southern.

49:54.225 --> 49:57.495
There are coriander seeds,
which I'm going to put...

49:57.528 --> 50:00.465
- Hi!
- How was your day?

50:00.498 --> 50:03.134
Fine.

50:03.168 --> 50:06.137
I had lunch with Willis.

50:06.171 --> 50:07.472
It was really great
to see him.

50:07.505 --> 50:10.007
My day was fine, too, thanks.

50:11.176 --> 50:13.411
Sorry, did you say something?

50:15.246 --> 50:16.714
No.

50:21.086 --> 50:23.488
Katie and Willis invited us

50:23.521 --> 50:26.291
up to the camp
for the weekend.

50:26.324 --> 50:27.658
I said I'd check with you

50:27.692 --> 50:31.096
in case we were doing
something else.

50:31.129 --> 50:34.132
That sounds fine.

50:36.134 --> 50:38.803
We, uh, we don't have to go.

50:38.836 --> 50:41.439
You don't want to?

50:41.472 --> 50:43.841
Yeah, I want to.

50:43.874 --> 50:45.776
Then tell them yes.

50:45.810 --> 50:51.449
Well, I thought you might be
busy getting the girls ready.

50:54.419 --> 50:57.155
No.

51:00.158 --> 51:01.292
Okay.

51:15.673 --> 51:17.608
All right,
the next matter is the matter

51:17.642 --> 51:20.345
of State of Maine
v. Richard Strout.

51:20.378 --> 51:22.313
The record should reflect

51:22.347 --> 51:24.415
that the defendant
has been incarcerated

51:24.449 --> 51:26.117
in the Knox County Jail
without bail

51:26.151 --> 51:28.886
since the 17th of July.

51:28.919 --> 51:31.622
We're here for a bail hearing.

51:31.656 --> 51:33.391
Mr. Davis, given the fact

51:33.424 --> 51:35.493
that we have a very
crowded trial calendar

51:35.526 --> 51:37.695
I'm going to suggest that we do
both the bail hearing

51:37.728 --> 51:40.665
and the probable cause hearing
today at 2:00.

51:40.698 --> 51:43.168
So unless I hear any
objection to the contrary.

51:43.201 --> 51:44.402
I'd like to set it for 2:00,

51:44.435 --> 51:47.305
and we will take testimony
of your witnesses at that time.

51:49.174 --> 51:51.909
Natalie: I...

51:51.942 --> 51:53.844
I closed the door.

51:58.883 --> 52:01.319
I...

52:01.352 --> 52:04.822
I walked t-through my room.

52:07.458 --> 52:09.694
( voice breaking)
I heard some yelling.

52:09.727 --> 52:14.232
I heard yelling.
Heard yelling.

52:14.265 --> 52:15.866
I got to the stairs

52:23.508 --> 52:25.443
( sighs )

52:25.476 --> 52:27.945
And then I heard--

52:27.978 --> 52:30.481
I heard the shot.

52:33.818 --> 52:34.952
Richard...

52:34.985 --> 52:37.322
- Lawyer: I-I'm sorry.
- ( sobs ) Richard...

52:37.355 --> 52:40.225
Could we go back
just a minute?

52:40.258 --> 52:44.262
Mrs. Strout, you said
you heard the shot.

52:44.295 --> 52:46.264
Yes.

52:46.297 --> 52:48.833
You heard the shot?

52:48.866 --> 52:51.236
Did you actually witness
the accident?

52:51.269 --> 52:52.770
Objection, your honor,
there are no grounds

52:52.803 --> 52:53.904
to indicate this
was an accident.

52:53.938 --> 52:55.340
Sustained.

52:55.373 --> 52:58.609
Strike the word "accident"
from the record.

52:58.643 --> 53:02.780
Rephrase your question,
Ms. Keyes.

53:02.813 --> 53:06.651
Mrs. Strout, in the
police report you stated

53:06.684 --> 53:11.489
that you had witnessed
the firearm discharge.

53:13.591 --> 53:16.193
Did you witness
the firearm discharge?

53:34.379 --> 53:36.881
I thought you said there
would be a jury trial

53:36.914 --> 53:38.783
some time in October.

53:38.816 --> 53:40.418
If he was incarcerated

53:40.451 --> 53:42.520
the judge would have set
an October court date

53:42.553 --> 53:43.921
basically to save the county

53:43.954 --> 53:46.724
the cost of housing
and feeding him as an inmate.

53:46.757 --> 53:51.362
But, with bail, unfortunately,
the court date is always later.

53:51.396 --> 53:53.731
You mean there's nothing
we can do about this?

53:53.764 --> 53:55.266
You let that bastard
just walk out,

53:55.300 --> 53:57.402
and we're supposed
to just sit here?

53:57.435 --> 54:00.938
We can't appeal bail.
It's just not set up that way.

54:00.971 --> 54:06.344
The state's ball code is to
ensure future court appearances.

54:06.377 --> 54:08.546
Now, in this case,
Strout's family was prepared

54:08.579 --> 54:10.848
to put up a substantial
amount of property as bail.

54:10.881 --> 54:14.752
That, along with his ties
to the community

54:14.785 --> 54:16.654
made it very hard for us
to convince a judge

54:16.687 --> 54:18.856
that there was a serious
risk of flight.

54:18.889 --> 54:21.392
Now, you can file
a civil suit.

54:21.426 --> 54:24.762
I recommend it.
But not now.

54:24.795 --> 54:26.331
Wait until after
the criminal trial.

54:26.364 --> 54:28.399
Ruth: And when will that be?

54:28.433 --> 54:33.871
Well, honestly could be anywhere
from 12 to 18 months.

54:33.904 --> 54:36.006
Oh, my God.

54:36.040 --> 54:39.577
You're confident you can put him
away for good then, right?

54:49.854 --> 54:54.559
The things she said in there,
what's the damage?

54:57.127 --> 55:03.768
The way this is going,
potentially manslaughter.

55:03.801 --> 55:06.371
Jesus Christ.

55:06.404 --> 55:09.674
He killed our son!

55:09.707 --> 55:12.710
He-- it was no accident.

55:12.743 --> 55:16.547
Ruth, Ruth, Ruth, Ruth.

55:16.581 --> 55:21.386
Uh. how long will
he be sent away for?

55:21.419 --> 55:22.920
Well, that's hard
to say, really.

55:22.953 --> 55:25.122
Anywhere from five to 15 years.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.892
But we're confident that
we'll get the maximum.

55:27.925 --> 55:30.027
- So even with good behavior...
- Five years?

55:30.060 --> 55:32.463
- He'll do ten full years.
- Ten years?

55:32.497 --> 55:33.898
Are you out of your mind?!

55:36.734 --> 55:39.504
Dr. Fowler, Mrs. Fowler,
I'm sorry.

55:39.537 --> 55:41.539
I understand.

55:41.572 --> 55:45.810
No, you don't.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.912
( whispering )
No, you don't.

56:34.725 --> 56:36.894
Reporter: Dr. Fowler,
what will your next step be?

56:36.927 --> 56:38.696
Matt: Uh, I don't know.

56:38.729 --> 56:40.498
Reporter: Dr. Fowler,
how do you feel

56:40.531 --> 56:41.799
about the result today?

56:41.832 --> 56:47.104
Matt: Well, that's--
that's something...

56:47.137 --> 56:49.073
Dr. Fowler, have you had
any contact with Mrs. Strout?

56:49.106 --> 56:50.708
Matt: No.

56:50.741 --> 56:53.478
How's Mrs. Fowler
handling this?

56:57.081 --> 56:59.984
Do you feel that justice
has been served today?

57:00.017 --> 57:02.820
I think our legal system
will determine that.

57:02.853 --> 57:05.022
( camera shutter clicking )

57:05.055 --> 57:10.027
( reporters clamoring )

57:10.060 --> 57:11.829
- ( door closes )
- Can you believe this?

57:11.862 --> 57:15.466
I ask those idiots to leave,
and no one budges, not one.

57:15.500 --> 57:17.768
What are we supposed to do,
make them sandwiches?

57:17.802 --> 57:19.704
What are you asking for?

57:19.737 --> 57:21.005
What?

57:21.038 --> 57:24.074
If you want them to leave,
tell them to leave.

57:27.778 --> 57:30.047
Okay, I'll tell them
to leave.

57:30.080 --> 57:31.048
Good.

57:41.091 --> 57:42.627
Woman on television:
And they never come up

57:42.660 --> 57:43.761
to the standard.

57:43.794 --> 57:45.963
And so they're always and
forever disappointed.

57:45.996 --> 57:48.533
Always.
They're never doing enough.

57:48.566 --> 57:49.934
They're never
working hard enough.

57:49.967 --> 57:51.201
They never behaved
right enough.

57:51.235 --> 57:53.003
They were never
a good enough father

57:53.037 --> 57:54.271
never a good enough husband.

57:54.304 --> 57:57.608
And not only can they not
please themselves sad to say,

57:57.642 --> 57:59.944
most of the time nobody else
can please them either.

58:14.659 --> 58:17.194
You slept late for you.

58:17.227 --> 58:21.131
Yeah, I took one of your pills.

58:21.165 --> 58:23.233
You never do that.

58:23.267 --> 58:26.804
Mmm.

58:26.837 --> 58:29.940
Well, there it is
in black and white.

58:29.974 --> 58:31.942
You should read some
of the things he says.

58:31.976 --> 58:35.546
It's unbelievable.

58:35.580 --> 58:36.981
Yeah.

58:41.652 --> 58:44.955
Well, I, uh,
I better be going.

58:44.989 --> 58:46.957
Where? It's Saturday.

58:46.991 --> 58:51.662
Oh, there's some stuff I have
to catch up on at the office.

58:51.696 --> 58:53.964
I won't be long.

59:00.237 --> 59:05.109
( door opens and closes )

59:09.947 --> 59:12.016
( cash register keys beeping,
receipt printing )

59:13.751 --> 59:16.186
Thank you.

59:16.220 --> 59:18.155
Do you want your receipt?

59:23.360 --> 59:24.729
Matt: Natalie.

59:26.396 --> 59:28.165
Hi.

59:28.198 --> 59:30.601
Hi.

59:30.635 --> 59:34.304
I, uh, hope I'm not
disturbing you.

59:34.338 --> 59:37.041
Unh-unh.

59:37.074 --> 59:39.944
Not at all.

59:39.977 --> 59:43.347
Could you break a 50,
please?

59:43.380 --> 59:44.715
Excuse me.

59:46.817 --> 59:49.620
( register beeps, whirs )

59:54.992 --> 59:56.894
Thank you, dear.

59:56.927 --> 59:58.963
Could I possibly have
another bag?

59:58.996 --> 01:00:00.030
Oh, sure.

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:11.208
( door bell tinkles )

01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:16.213
Yeah, well, I was just, uh...
just wondering how you're doing.

01:00:18.082 --> 01:00:20.951
I tried to reach you.

01:00:20.985 --> 01:00:22.920
Oh.

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:25.422
Um...

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:27.091
we're at my mom's now.

01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:31.962
I wanted to call you.

01:00:31.996 --> 01:00:34.031
That's-- that's okay.

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:41.038
Dr. Fowler, I...

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.406
can't...

01:00:42.439 --> 01:00:44.374
yeah, I-I know.

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:54.051
I didn't lie.

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:59.023
I didn't lie the first time.

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:00.691
It was--

01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:05.362
it's how it came out.

01:01:07.131 --> 01:01:09.133
( door bell tinkles )

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:15.272
Mrs. Fowler?

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:17.141
No, uh--

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.909
Man: Can I get a pack
of Marlboro Reds?

01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:28.919
( register beeping )

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:35.325
( bangs register )

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:37.361
( receipt printing )

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:43.000
( door bell tinkles )

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.102
( door closes )

01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:48.305
How are the boys?

01:01:48.338 --> 01:01:49.740
They all right?

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:53.978
Yeah.

01:01:57.181 --> 01:02:00.350
Uh, I got to go.

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:02.419
I'll see you.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:17.868
So how much of this is yours?

01:02:17.902 --> 01:02:21.105
( chuckles )
You ask me that every time.

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:23.407
You know the cove,
the other side of the cabin?

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.408
Yeah.

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:26.844
All the way to
the other shoreline.

01:02:26.877 --> 01:02:29.513
Almost 350 acres.

01:02:29.546 --> 01:02:31.215
Know what it went for
when I bought it?

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:32.249
No.

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:33.818
You don't want to know.

01:02:33.851 --> 01:02:34.919
( both chuckle )

01:02:41.992 --> 01:02:44.461
Oh, and that's little Charles
down at the pool.

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:47.865
He figured out how to
get down to the pool

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:50.901
on the elevator
by himself.

01:02:50.935 --> 01:02:52.369
Oh, he must've
been very proud.

01:02:52.402 --> 01:02:54.204
Oh, yeah.

01:02:54.238 --> 01:02:56.206
Oh, and that's Shannon
waiting in line for--

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.843
oh, my God,
that roller coaster.

01:02:58.876 --> 01:03:00.410
You know the one?
Oh, my God.

01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:02.446
Were the lines very long?

01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:04.849
Uh, yeah, yeah, sometimes.

01:03:04.882 --> 01:03:06.116
60 minutes and upwards.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:12.990
Unless, of course,
you got the, um, Fastpass.

01:03:13.023 --> 01:03:15.125
What's the Fastpass?

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:17.061
Uh, well, you know,

01:03:17.094 --> 01:03:20.230
you got all these different
kingdoms there and, uh,

01:03:20.264 --> 01:03:22.599
so you take this Fastpass.

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.234
It's kind of a laminated card.

01:03:24.268 --> 01:03:25.970
You just put into a machine

01:03:26.003 --> 01:03:27.838
and it tells you
when to come back

01:03:27.872 --> 01:03:30.107
so, you know, you don't
have to wait in line.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.976
You just go right in and...

01:03:32.009 --> 01:03:34.544
You guys ever
go to Florida?

01:03:34.578 --> 01:03:36.513
No.

01:03:39.116 --> 01:03:42.152
How many grandchildren
do you have now?

01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:43.320
Um...

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:46.523
( laughs )

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:50.394
uh, well, all right, there's
little Charles and Shannon

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:54.999
um, the three older ones
and the babies.

01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:58.335
( quietly )
Joe, Jay, Mary, George...

01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:01.138
Wendy, Lee--
so that's 11.

01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:04.975
Must be wonderful.

01:04:05.009 --> 01:04:06.510
Willis always says
"I guess there's no danger

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:08.378
of us dying off."

01:04:24.494 --> 01:04:26.496
( voice breaking )
I'm so sorry, Ruth.

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:29.533
I just wasn't thinking.

01:04:31.035 --> 01:04:35.139
I wanted to have more, uh,
but we had Frank,

01:04:35.172 --> 01:04:40.210
and... Matt was just
starting his practice.

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:44.915
So I guess it made sense.

01:04:56.093 --> 01:04:58.595
Little Charles.

01:04:58.628 --> 01:05:00.597
Willis: Only got half
a cord of oak left at home.

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:03.968
And you know how much that
bastard Daniels charges.

01:05:04.001 --> 01:05:06.103
At least I can stack this
up to the cabin

01:05:06.136 --> 01:05:08.939
have something
to burn this fall.

01:05:15.012 --> 01:05:17.647
Katie: You know,
it's a wonderful product

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:19.516
and they treat you
pretty good.

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:22.686
On account of selling Mary Kay,
we got the new Subaru.

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:24.955
Well, the ride up
was very comfortable.

01:05:24.989 --> 01:05:26.123
It's a very nice car.

01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:27.291
Well, it's not really a car.

01:05:27.324 --> 01:05:30.427
It's got four-wheel drive.
It's a little SUV.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:33.130
What the hell is
all that "SUV" crap?

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:35.132
Willis:
"Sports utility vehicle."

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:36.400
It's a little Jeep.

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:38.602
SUV?

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:42.306
( laughing )
ATV and KFC.

01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:45.175
What's with all these--
uh, these, uh...

01:05:45.209 --> 01:05:46.476
- Acronyms.
- Yeah.

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:48.612
I guess it's just
too much trouble

01:05:48.645 --> 01:05:51.081
to say what something
is anymore.

01:05:51.115 --> 01:05:52.682
What does PMS stand for?

01:05:52.716 --> 01:05:54.684
All right,
I was an Army brat.

01:05:54.718 --> 01:05:57.021
I grew up with Jeeps.

01:05:57.054 --> 01:05:59.123
Willy, he's uncomfortable

01:05:59.156 --> 01:06:02.659
that I know more about one
masculine thing than he does.

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:04.094
Only one?

01:06:04.128 --> 01:06:05.329
( laughter )

01:06:05.362 --> 01:06:07.131
Thanks, buddy.

01:06:07.164 --> 01:06:09.199
I like this guy.

01:06:18.775 --> 01:06:22.279
You've done a nice job
up here, Katie.

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:25.182
Don't tell me you made
these curtains.

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:26.783
Is that antique linen?

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.185
Well, sort of.

01:06:28.218 --> 01:06:30.754
They're pillowcases
from our first house.

01:06:30.787 --> 01:06:35.792
I've saved every knickknack
and whim-wham we ever had,

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.694
you included.

01:06:56.313 --> 01:06:59.383
Willis: Well,
our timing is off.

01:06:59.416 --> 01:07:01.318
( Matt chuckles )

01:07:20.104 --> 01:07:21.738
Of course,
he don't like working

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:22.806
in recruitment, anyhows.

01:07:22.839 --> 01:07:25.109
Christ, they got them boys
coming down

01:07:25.142 --> 01:07:26.410
to the office in the mall.

01:07:26.443 --> 01:07:28.212
He gets them half-processed
and they decide

01:07:28.245 --> 01:07:30.447
they want to take
that "delayed entry" thing.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.481
Christ, I couldn't do it.

01:07:31.515 --> 01:07:33.783
Katie: Or they decide
not to join up at all.

01:07:33.817 --> 01:07:36.120
Willis: Like that one kid.

01:07:36.153 --> 01:07:39.456
He had him all the way
through the works and, Christ.

01:07:39.489 --> 01:07:43.393
Yeah the boy's folks
called, uh, called David

01:07:43.427 --> 01:07:46.563
and said that the boy was--
he wanted out so bad

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:50.134
that he-- well,
he'd taken his own life.

01:07:50.167 --> 01:07:52.836
Something like that
gets to you.

01:07:52.869 --> 01:07:54.271
Christ, I couldn't do it.

01:08:11.255 --> 01:08:12.856
I'm going now.

01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:15.259
Okay.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:21.131
Are you looking forward
to going back?

01:08:21.165 --> 01:08:24.167
Mm-hmm.

01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:26.203
You look nice.

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:50.894
( chuckles )

01:08:56.633 --> 01:09:00.170
( laughing )

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:03.207
( woman singing )

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.809
( choir singing
Balkan folk song )

01:09:55.959 --> 01:09:57.026
( singing stops )

01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:00.797
That was very good.
I goofed up a little bit, but...

01:10:31.661 --> 01:10:33.363
- Ruth.
- ( gasps )

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:37.934
It comes in waves.

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:43.640
And then nothing...

01:10:43.673 --> 01:10:46.910
like a rest in music.

01:10:46.943 --> 01:10:49.579
No sound, but so loud.

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:55.819
I don't know what to do.

01:10:55.852 --> 01:10:59.456
I-- I feel so angry.

01:11:02.426 --> 01:11:05.495
Louise McVey...

01:11:05.529 --> 01:11:08.632
lost a child
a few years back.

01:11:08.665 --> 01:11:11.535
Maybe you remember.

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:13.503
She had four.

01:11:13.537 --> 01:11:14.904
It was the youngest,
wasn't it?

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:17.474
Yes.

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:20.844
She told me about
a vision she had

01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:24.481
when she found out
her daughter had died.

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:28.552
She saw herself at a great
distance from the Earth

01:11:28.585 --> 01:11:32.389
and encircling it,
an endless line.

01:11:32.422 --> 01:11:34.624
As she got closer

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:38.528
she saw that it was made up
of mothers

01:11:38.562 --> 01:11:41.431
traveling forward.

01:11:41.465 --> 01:11:45.335
She fell into line
and began walking with them.

01:11:45.369 --> 01:11:47.771
When they reached
a certain point

01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:52.041
the line divided,
and she said she knew

01:11:52.075 --> 01:11:57.381
that all the millions
of women on her side

01:11:57.414 --> 01:12:01.385
were the mothers
who had lost children.

01:12:10.126 --> 01:12:13.797
She seemed to find
great comfort in that.

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:20.604
How did
the little girl die?

01:12:20.637 --> 01:12:23.840
A drowning, some kind
of swimming accident.

01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:26.643
Oh.

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:41.124
The name of the game
is Texas chase 'em.

01:12:41.157 --> 01:12:42.892
Henry: Oh, geez.

01:12:42.926 --> 01:12:43.893
Is there a problem?

01:12:43.927 --> 01:12:45.962
Why do you always delude
yourself with that crap?

01:12:45.995 --> 01:12:48.932
- What are you talking about?
- Look, we're not in Vegas.

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:51.535
It's five-card draw
or seven-card stud.

01:12:51.568 --> 01:12:55.038
That's what I said--
five-card draw, jacks to open.

01:12:55.071 --> 01:12:58.575
- Carl?
- Asshole.

01:12:58.608 --> 01:13:01.044
I'll bet a buck.

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:02.679
Raise a buck.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.489
( sighs )

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:27.904
Say something,
for Chrissake.

01:13:27.937 --> 01:13:30.173
Quit pussyfooting around me.

01:13:32.976 --> 01:13:36.079
You want me to stare
at these cards all night?

01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:55.499
There are things
of which I may not speak.

01:13:58.535 --> 01:14:00.570
There are dreams
that cannot die.

01:14:03.006 --> 01:14:08.512
There are thoughts
that make the strong heart weak

01:14:08.545 --> 01:14:11.214
and bring a pallor
into the cheek

01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:14.584
and a mist before the eye.

01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:21.157
And the words
of that fatal song

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:23.693
come over me like a chill...

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:30.066
"a boy's will...

01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:33.570
is the wind's will.

01:14:33.603 --> 01:14:36.039
and the thoughts of youth.

01:14:36.072 --> 01:14:38.742
are long,
long thoughts."

01:14:48.284 --> 01:14:50.820
Okay, you got the two.

01:14:50.854 --> 01:14:52.689
Willis: I'm in there.

01:14:52.722 --> 01:14:53.890
I'll take one.

01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:55.525
Willis:
Okay, you got it.

01:14:55.559 --> 01:14:58.995
I'm going to need--
oh, I need them all-- three.

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:01.865
Make them good.

01:16:12.736 --> 01:16:15.171
( couple talking indistinctly )

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.355
( car door shuts )

01:16:53.409 --> 01:16:55.611
( metal clinks )

01:16:57.781 --> 01:17:00.049
Matt?

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:01.685
( metal clinks )

01:17:54.137 --> 01:17:55.404
Ah!

01:19:19.055 --> 01:19:21.457
Sportscaster on radio:
Atlanta 1, Red Sox nothing.

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:24.260
From the stretch, Martinez.

01:19:24.293 --> 01:19:27.396
Still one and two on Jordan.
He's hit 13 home runs.

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:30.033
He's got a teammate at third
with two down.

01:19:30.066 --> 01:19:33.536
Ramon Martinez gets the sign,
checks the runner at third.

01:19:33.569 --> 01:19:35.471
Comes to the belt
and to the plate.

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:38.842
A swing and a bouncer
up the middle.

01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:40.543
Nomar fields it,
gloves it, throws to first.

01:19:40.576 --> 01:19:41.945
Inning over.

01:19:41.978 --> 01:19:44.347
They leave a man
in scoring position.

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:46.315
Jordan's out--
six to three.

01:19:46.349 --> 01:19:49.385
Good effort in that inning
by Ramon Martinez

01:19:49.418 --> 01:19:50.686
against a tough hitter.

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:54.958
After two and a half innings,
Atlanta one, Red Sox nothing

01:19:54.991 --> 01:19:57.260
on the WEEI
Red Sox radio network.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:20:01.564
No. I'm sorry,
that's totally unacceptable.

01:20:01.597 --> 01:20:03.466
Yeah, so what did he say?

01:20:05.568 --> 01:20:08.137
He-- no,
we can't allow that.

01:20:08.171 --> 01:20:09.405
Hold it a sec.

01:20:09.438 --> 01:20:10.840
Excuse me, Matt.

01:20:10.874 --> 01:20:12.308
Ryan Collit's out there.

01:20:12.341 --> 01:20:14.210
His mother
just brought him in.

01:20:14.243 --> 01:20:16.579
I'll, uh, I'll call
you back later, okay?

01:20:16.612 --> 01:20:18.882
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

01:20:21.017 --> 01:20:22.385
I'll be back at 4:00,
Janelle.

01:20:24.988 --> 01:20:26.923
Okay.

01:20:26.956 --> 01:20:29.558
I'm sorry, Dr. Fowler,
but you just missed him.

01:20:29.592 --> 01:20:31.194
Thank you.

01:20:31.227 --> 01:20:34.330
No, I really need to see him.
He go to lunch?

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:36.232
That's right.

01:20:41.637 --> 01:20:44.007
He's across the street.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.574
Thank you.

01:21:12.535 --> 01:21:16.539
That's what they do,
you know?

01:21:16.572 --> 01:21:17.941
Oh, hey, Matt.

01:21:17.974 --> 01:21:21.544
Hi.

01:21:21.577 --> 01:21:22.946
Have a seat.

01:21:22.979 --> 01:21:24.347
Thank you. Thank you.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.951
- This is my assistant, Jack.
- Oh, hi, Jack.

01:21:27.984 --> 01:21:29.652
- Don.
- Hi, Don.

01:21:29.685 --> 01:21:31.955
This is Ed.
That's Matt Fowler.

01:21:31.988 --> 01:21:34.057
So how's everything going?

01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:38.427
Oh, uh, it's--
it's okay, you know.

01:21:38.461 --> 01:21:42.598
I just wanted to go over
a couple of things, and,

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:46.102
you know, when-- when
you've had your lunch.

01:21:46.135 --> 01:21:47.570
Sure.

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:51.407
We really are doing
everything we can, Matt.

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.409
- I promise you that.
- Yeah. What can I do, Bill?

01:21:53.442 --> 01:21:55.278
There's nothing, really.

01:21:55.311 --> 01:21:58.381
Look, it can't be manslaughter.
There's got to be something.

01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:00.216
Can't you find something,
you know,

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:02.118
like-- like some piece
of evidence?

01:22:02.151 --> 01:22:04.520
I mean, that happens.
Doesn't that happen?

01:22:04.553 --> 01:22:06.255
We really are doing
everything we can.

01:22:06.289 --> 01:22:10.093
I'm not going to lie to you--
all we've got is Strout.

01:22:10.126 --> 01:22:11.560
He claims that
there was a struggle.

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:14.030
Forensics can't determine if
there was a struggle because

01:22:14.063 --> 01:22:17.566
of the condition of the house
when Frank got there.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.070
The best thing for you to do
is just sit tight.

01:22:21.104 --> 01:22:23.339
Now, we haven't thrown
in the towel yet

01:22:23.372 --> 01:22:24.673
and you shouldn't either.

01:22:24.707 --> 01:22:26.475
We've still got two
investigators

01:22:26.509 --> 01:22:27.543
working on this case.

01:22:27.576 --> 01:22:30.446
( voice fading ) It's still
a priority case for us.

01:22:30.479 --> 01:22:32.381
We've got leads we're
following up on...

01:22:32.415 --> 01:22:34.317
( coins jingling loudly )

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:37.053
before we wrap this up,
but we're doing the best we can

01:22:37.086 --> 01:22:39.155
with the resources
that we have.

01:22:39.188 --> 01:22:41.991
You've just got to hang
in there with us.

01:22:42.025 --> 01:22:44.293
You have to have
some confidence.

01:22:44.327 --> 01:22:47.496
( jingling continues )

01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:50.233
( alarm blares )

01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:03.112
( engine starts )

01:23:04.747 --> 01:23:07.483
Man: He takes these bats and
nails them right on the wall

01:23:07.516 --> 01:23:10.353
above the scale because he
knows big mouth's gonna come

01:23:10.386 --> 01:23:12.488
in there and weigh his catch
eventually, you know?

01:23:12.521 --> 01:23:14.257
He's putting the bats up,
one of the old-timers says

01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:16.425
"Hey, Ivan, what
the hell are you doing?"

01:23:16.459 --> 01:23:18.061
The old man says,
"Sending a message,"

01:23:18.094 --> 01:23:19.428
and turns around
and walks out the door, right?

01:23:19.462 --> 01:23:21.764
Now, I walk in,
there's these damn baseball bats

01:23:21.797 --> 01:23:24.533
up on the wall, right,
with a big, huge note written

01:23:24.567 --> 01:23:28.204
- right across the front
of them. ( laughs )
- What'd it say?

01:23:28.237 --> 01:23:30.573
"Here's the bats,
if you got the balls."

01:23:30.606 --> 01:23:32.475
( both laughing )

01:23:36.279 --> 01:23:38.281
He never messed
with our traps again.

01:23:38.314 --> 01:23:39.615
Hey, Dr. Fowler.

01:23:39.648 --> 01:23:43.352
Oh, hi, Tim.

01:23:43.386 --> 01:23:46.322
Did he ever, uh...

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:50.526
did he ever talk to you
about what happened on that day?

01:23:50.559 --> 01:23:53.429
No. No.

01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:55.231
I don't even see
Richard anymore.

01:23:55.264 --> 01:23:57.400
and he'd never tell me
anything anyway.

01:23:57.433 --> 01:23:58.567
Believe me.

01:23:58.601 --> 01:24:01.270
Oh, sure, sure.
Of course not.

01:24:01.304 --> 01:24:03.506
I was just wondering if--
if, uh, you know

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:06.575
maybe you heard something
through the grapevine.

01:24:06.609 --> 01:24:09.645
Maybe, uh, maybe one
of his buddies said something?

01:24:12.415 --> 01:24:13.482
No.

01:24:13.516 --> 01:24:16.585
I was thinking--

01:24:16.619 --> 01:24:18.321
his brothers still work
with you, right?

01:24:18.354 --> 01:24:21.124
They must talk.

01:24:24.327 --> 01:24:27.430
What I'm saying is,
if we could find something--

01:24:27.463 --> 01:24:29.098
just something concrete.

01:24:29.132 --> 01:24:30.599
If you could--

01:24:30.633 --> 01:24:34.637
it could be just, you know,
a slip of the tongue.

01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:43.546
I'll keep my ears open.

01:24:46.849 --> 01:24:49.752
Thank you.

01:24:49.785 --> 01:24:56.492
It's funny running into
you here, Dr. Fowler.

01:24:56.525 --> 01:24:58.227
Yeah, well...

01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:04.533
( music playing indistinctly
through headphones )

01:25:22.585 --> 01:25:24.920
( click, music stops )

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:29.758
Oh, I was hoping
we could talk.

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:32.161
I...

01:25:32.195 --> 01:25:38.901
I wanted to tell you
how truly sorry I am,.

01:25:38.934 --> 01:25:41.437
and...

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:46.575
if there's anything
that I can ever...

01:25:46.609 --> 01:25:49.212
do to-- to...

01:25:51.347 --> 01:25:53.549
talk with you...

01:25:56.719 --> 01:25:58.287
Oh!

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.469
( music playing indistinctly
through headphones )

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:26.615
( men laugh )

01:26:26.649 --> 01:26:28.817
Man, better get back
to the grind

01:26:28.851 --> 01:26:30.519
and don't steal anything.

01:26:30.553 --> 01:26:32.688
Hello, Mrs. Fowler.

01:26:37.893 --> 01:26:39.495
Will there be anything else?

01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:41.564
I want a pack
of Marlboro Lights.

01:26:41.597 --> 01:26:43.266
Sure.

01:26:48.804 --> 01:26:53.576
That will be, uh, $14.95
with the cigarettes.

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:01.650
Thank you.

01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:14.597
Matt: How did it go today?

01:27:29.945 --> 01:27:31.614
Something wrong?

01:27:31.647 --> 01:27:32.981
Wrong?

01:27:33.015 --> 01:27:34.783
What could be wrong, Matt?

01:27:55.704 --> 01:27:57.406
What do you want?

01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.608
I want to know
what's going on.

01:27:59.642 --> 01:28:01.777
Oh, right.

01:28:01.810 --> 01:28:03.679
You're obviously upset.

01:28:03.712 --> 01:28:05.848
Is there something
we can talk about?

01:28:05.881 --> 01:28:09.918
Talk? Who, us?

01:28:09.952 --> 01:28:13.456
What if somebody walked in?
They wouldn't recognize us.

01:28:13.489 --> 01:28:16.592
They'd think they were
in the wrong house.

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:18.827
Do you want to talk or not?

01:28:18.861 --> 01:28:22.565
Oh, you mean about
our dead son? No.

01:28:22.598 --> 01:28:24.567
We haven't before.

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.703
Why should we bother now?

01:28:27.736 --> 01:28:30.072
What can I do, Ruth?

01:28:30.105 --> 01:28:32.408
Forget it, Matt.

01:28:32.441 --> 01:28:34.677
Why don't you just go?

01:28:34.710 --> 01:28:37.580
What do you want from me?

01:28:37.613 --> 01:28:41.750
I want you to stop acting
like nothing's happened.

01:28:41.784 --> 01:28:43.386
That's what I want.

01:28:43.419 --> 01:28:46.889
Why, because I'm not
bouncing off the walls?

01:28:46.922 --> 01:28:49.458
No, Matt,
that would require feelings.

01:28:49.492 --> 01:28:51.594
We don't want you
to hurt yourself.

01:28:51.627 --> 01:28:52.928
Do me a favor, Ruth.

01:28:52.961 --> 01:28:56.331
You want a grieving contest,
go find someone else.

01:28:58.534 --> 01:29:00.503
Oh, I know how you grieve.

01:29:00.536 --> 01:29:01.904
Go have another beer.

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:07.676
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:09.545
What do you know?

01:29:09.578 --> 01:29:10.713
You know nothing.

01:29:10.746 --> 01:29:13.716
You don't you don't know
what I go through.

01:29:13.749 --> 01:29:16.919
No, I don't know
what you go through, Matt

01:29:16.952 --> 01:29:19.388
or if you go through
anything.

01:29:19.422 --> 01:29:22.858
But that's your choice,
dear, not mine.

01:29:22.891 --> 01:29:24.627
You're goddamn right it is.

01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:26.662
My choice is not to
scream at the world.

01:29:26.695 --> 01:29:29.598
Maybe one of us has to be
reasonable around here.

01:29:29.632 --> 01:29:32.601
- You ever think of that?
- Reasonable?

01:29:32.635 --> 01:29:34.603
Gee, Matt...

01:29:34.637 --> 01:29:38.607
I don't know about you,
but I miss my son.

01:29:38.641 --> 01:29:40.609
I'm glad you have time
for reason.

01:29:40.643 --> 01:29:43.979
That's what you imparted
to Frank, that sense of reason.

01:29:44.012 --> 01:29:45.514
( dish clatters )

01:29:45.548 --> 01:29:50.118
Oh, he thought you were
very reasonable.

01:29:50.152 --> 01:29:52.688
What are you talking about?

01:29:55.824 --> 01:29:57.092
Nothing.

01:30:02.765 --> 01:30:06.502
Are you--
are you saying that--

01:30:06.535 --> 01:30:10.005
that I'm the one
responsible?

01:30:12.541 --> 01:30:13.642
Is that it?

01:30:13.676 --> 01:30:15.844
Well, uh...

01:30:15.878 --> 01:30:17.646
well, let me tell you
something.

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:18.814
Let me tell you something.

01:30:18.847 --> 01:30:21.917
- You got it backwards.
- ( water stops running )

01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:24.620
I know what you think--
that-- that I was too lenient.

01:30:24.653 --> 01:30:26.655
That I let him get away with--

01:30:26.689 --> 01:30:28.591
Everything! Everything!

01:30:28.624 --> 01:30:31.126
Yes, yes, yes, and why?
Why did he ever come to you?.

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:35.664
- He wouldn't listen to me!
- No, he wouldn't
listen to you--

01:30:35.698 --> 01:30:38.200
He wouldn't listen
to you because you
never listened to him.

01:30:38.233 --> 01:30:39.602
No, but you did.

01:30:39.635 --> 01:30:41.670
You were winking at him
the whole time.

01:30:41.704 --> 01:30:43.706
You encouraged him.

01:30:43.739 --> 01:30:45.708
You wanted what he had--
her.

01:30:45.741 --> 01:30:48.611
Oh, my God,
you've got to be kidding!

01:30:48.644 --> 01:30:49.444
Come on, you know it!

01:30:49.478 --> 01:30:51.780
You wanted it
and you couldn't get it.

01:30:51.814 --> 01:30:53.682
That's why you didn't
stop him--

01:30:53.716 --> 01:30:56.552
so you could get
your kicks through your son.

01:30:56.585 --> 01:30:59.254
You can't admit the truth
to me or to yourself

01:30:59.287 --> 01:31:02.525
that Frank died for your
fantasy piece of ass!

01:31:02.558 --> 01:31:06.194
Oh, you know...

01:31:06.228 --> 01:31:08.864
y-you want to know
why our son is dead?

01:31:08.897 --> 01:31:10.699
You really want to know?

01:31:10.733 --> 01:31:14.503
He was with her not
because of me.

01:31:14.537 --> 01:31:16.672
He went there
because of you.

01:31:16.705 --> 01:31:21.076
Yes, he did because
you are so controlling,

01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:24.913
so overbearing,

01:31:24.947 --> 01:31:27.850
so angry that he was it.

01:31:27.883 --> 01:31:30.152
That he was our only one.

01:31:30.185 --> 01:31:31.720
That is not true.

01:31:31.754 --> 01:31:33.589
Oh, yes, it is.
Yes, it is.

01:31:33.622 --> 01:31:35.791
Even when he was a kid
you were telling him how--

01:31:35.824 --> 01:31:37.993
how he was always wrong.

01:31:38.026 --> 01:31:40.596
Oh, I remember

01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:43.999
one time you yanked him
out of a Little League game

01:31:44.032 --> 01:31:45.901
and sent him home

01:31:45.934 --> 01:31:49.738
for throwing his--
his glove in the dirt.

01:31:49.772 --> 01:31:53.576
He was what?
Nine years old?

01:32:02.985 --> 01:32:06.388
Everything he did was wrong.

01:32:10.258 --> 01:32:13.762
Well, what was wrong
with him, Ruth?

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:27.576
You're--
you're so unforgiving.

01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:29.044
You are.

01:32:29.077 --> 01:32:30.879
That's what he said.

01:32:36.652 --> 01:32:39.154
And you're pulling
the same shit with me

01:32:39.187 --> 01:32:41.256
and that's a horrible way
to be.

01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:44.760
It's horrible.

01:32:44.793 --> 01:32:46.662
You're bitter, Ruth.

01:32:46.695 --> 01:32:50.999
And you can point your finger
at me all you like

01:32:51.033 --> 01:32:54.703
but you better take
a damn good look at yourself.

01:33:05.013 --> 01:33:08.651
I just wanted to talk
about what happened, Matt.

01:33:10.686 --> 01:33:12.688
( chuckles )

01:33:12.721 --> 01:33:16.291
You want me to be open with you,
embrace you?

01:33:16.324 --> 01:33:18.661
You scare me.

01:33:18.694 --> 01:33:21.263
How can I talk to you?

01:33:21.296 --> 01:33:22.765
Sometimes I--

01:33:22.798 --> 01:33:24.833
sometimes I can't
even look at you.

01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:33.876
( tapping on door )

01:33:33.909 --> 01:33:36.845
Oh, God.

01:33:36.879 --> 01:33:39.682
( tapping continues )

01:33:39.715 --> 01:33:41.183
( sighs )

01:33:41.216 --> 01:33:43.986
That's probably the police.

01:33:49.224 --> 01:33:51.026
Hi, there,
I'm Kristen Gellar

01:33:51.059 --> 01:33:53.395
from the Rockland
Gymnastics Association

01:33:53.428 --> 01:33:56.231
and today we're selling
brand-name candy.

01:33:56.264 --> 01:33:59.301
Each purchase is matched
by the Tandy Corporation

01:33:59.334 --> 01:34:02.170
to help us meet our goal
of traveling to Oahu

01:34:02.204 --> 01:34:04.406
to compete in the east/west
conference.

01:34:04.439 --> 01:34:07.375
Uh, okay, I'll,
uh I'll take some.

01:34:07.409 --> 01:34:10.012
Oh, and today we have
a special.

01:34:10.045 --> 01:34:11.680
Six bars for $10.

01:34:11.714 --> 01:34:14.683
Okay, I'll, uh--
I'll do that.

01:34:18.887 --> 01:34:20.889
- Should I hold something?
- Yeah. Could you hold this?

01:34:20.923 --> 01:34:22.758
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:27.863
Okay, there's--
there's the 10.

01:34:27.896 --> 01:34:29.197
Thank you.

01:34:29.231 --> 01:34:30.999
Here.

01:34:31.033 --> 01:34:32.434
You can pick
anything you want.

01:34:32.467 --> 01:34:33.902
Any six is-- okay.

01:34:43.812 --> 01:34:45.714
Ruth.

01:34:50.819 --> 01:34:52.454
What I said just now...

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:56.992
I, uh...

01:34:57.025 --> 01:34:59.027
I had no right.

01:35:01.496 --> 01:35:04.432
No one...

01:35:04.466 --> 01:35:07.936
no one should ever have
to hear stuff like that.

01:35:11.506 --> 01:35:13.341
I'm so sorry.

01:35:21.516 --> 01:35:22.751
It's okay.

01:35:22.785 --> 01:35:27.923
No. You're right, Matt.

01:35:27.956 --> 01:35:30.492
I am horrible.

01:35:32.027 --> 01:35:34.763
Please, please, please don't.

01:35:39.501 --> 01:35:41.503
I don't blame you.

01:35:44.472 --> 01:35:47.275
It's just...

01:35:47.309 --> 01:35:49.444
that girl came by the school.

01:35:53.882 --> 01:35:55.450
And I couldn't forgive her.

01:35:57.485 --> 01:36:00.022
And I was...

01:36:00.055 --> 01:36:01.857
I was so...

01:36:09.431 --> 01:36:11.299
I'm sorry.

01:36:11.333 --> 01:36:14.469
I've been so--

01:36:14.502 --> 01:36:17.372
I've been so angry.

01:36:17.405 --> 01:36:19.007
That's okay.

01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:23.045
It's just...

01:36:26.481 --> 01:36:29.918
I've seen him,
and I keep seeing him.

01:36:29.952 --> 01:36:32.187
I know. I--
I know.

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:34.389
In his room, you know,

01:36:34.422 --> 01:36:37.492
sometimes I can swear
he's there.

01:36:37.525 --> 01:36:41.864
And, uh, today, at a stoplight,
I could've sworn Frank--

01:36:41.897 --> 01:36:44.232
Not Frank.

01:36:44.266 --> 01:36:47.502
Richard.

01:36:47.535 --> 01:36:50.038
( sobbing )
And I don't know what to do.

01:36:58.947 --> 01:37:01.583
Ruth, Ruth, Ruth.

01:37:01.616 --> 01:37:04.452
Uh...

01:37:04.486 --> 01:37:06.421
where--
where did you see him?

01:37:06.454 --> 01:37:08.924
Everywhere. Downtown.
At the market.

01:37:08.957 --> 01:37:12.460
I saw him--
I saw him at South End.

01:37:12.494 --> 01:37:15.197
He smiled at me, Matt.

01:37:18.366 --> 01:37:21.937
I keep running into him.

01:37:21.970 --> 01:37:23.505
He smiled.

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:27.209
( crying )

01:37:27.242 --> 01:37:30.879
Oh, it's okay.

01:37:30.913 --> 01:37:32.614
It's okay, it's okay.

01:38:16.024 --> 01:38:18.526
Katie: Honey,
are you coming to bed now?

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:20.328
Soon, baby.
Matt's still here.

01:38:20.362 --> 01:38:23.131
Oh.
Well well, hi, Matt.

01:38:23.165 --> 01:38:24.566
Uh, honey,
when you come to bed,

01:38:24.599 --> 01:38:26.568
would you bring me my pills?

01:38:26.601 --> 01:38:28.703
Um, they're on the, um,
top shelf

01:38:28.736 --> 01:38:30.572
from when the kids
were here.

01:38:30.605 --> 01:38:32.474
- All right.
- All right, thanks, dear.

01:38:35.978 --> 01:38:39.414
Matt: I never thought
about bail.

01:38:39.447 --> 01:38:43.385
I thought I wouldn't have
to worry about him for years.

01:38:43.418 --> 01:38:45.420
You know what I heard?

01:38:45.453 --> 01:38:48.523
He's tending bar up
to Old Orchard Beach

01:38:48.556 --> 01:38:50.558
for a friend.

01:38:50.592 --> 01:38:53.528
You ever notice even the
worst bastards have friends?

01:38:53.561 --> 01:38:56.098
Well, nobody knows
him over there.

01:38:56.131 --> 01:38:59.167
If they do, they don't care.
They drink what he mixes.

01:39:03.171 --> 01:39:05.040
I hate him, Matt.

01:39:05.073 --> 01:39:07.642
My boys went to school with him.
He was the same then.

01:39:07.675 --> 01:39:11.379
You know what he'll do?
Five years at the most.

01:39:11.413 --> 01:39:13.148
Yeah, I know.

01:39:13.181 --> 01:39:15.717
Remember that woman
about seven years ago?

01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:18.987
Shot her husband and dropped him
off the bridge in the St. George

01:39:19.021 --> 01:39:20.488
with a 100-pound sack
of cement

01:39:20.522 --> 01:39:22.991
and said the whole way
through it, nobody helped her.

01:39:23.025 --> 01:39:25.327
- You know where she is now?
- Where?

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:28.363
She's up to Searsport
now, a secretary,

01:39:28.396 --> 01:39:32.467
and whoever helped her,
where the hell is he?

01:39:41.609 --> 01:39:45.313
It'd break my heart,
Matt, it would.

01:39:45.347 --> 01:39:51.486
But you ever think
about just...

01:39:51.519 --> 01:39:52.754
moving away?

01:39:56.624 --> 01:39:58.193
Yeah, we have.

01:39:59.694 --> 01:40:01.463
It wouldn't matter.

01:40:03.198 --> 01:40:05.533
Yeah.

01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:10.072
( woman singing slow
Balkan folk song )

01:40:21.583 --> 01:40:24.619
( women join in singing )

01:41:48.436 --> 01:41:51.573
Let me lock the place up.
I'll walk you to your car.

01:41:51.606 --> 01:41:53.408
Good night, Richard.
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:41:53.441 --> 01:41:55.510
Wait up. Come on, you want
to come over for a drink?

01:41:55.543 --> 01:41:56.644
No, thanks.

01:41:56.678 --> 01:41:58.546
- Come on!
- Maybe some other night.

01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:00.182
Just one drink?

01:42:00.215 --> 01:42:01.183
( engine starts )

01:42:01.216 --> 01:42:03.751
Come on!

01:42:03.785 --> 01:42:05.487
All right.

01:42:06.854 --> 01:42:08.523
Fucking bitch.

01:42:24.606 --> 01:42:26.441
What are you doing here?

01:42:31.913 --> 01:42:35.517
Anything I can...
help you with?

01:42:47.662 --> 01:42:48.663
Don't talk.

01:42:48.696 --> 01:42:49.831
Oh, God.

01:42:49.864 --> 01:42:52.667
Unlock the door and get in.

01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:55.637
Wait just a minute.
Let's calm down.

01:42:55.670 --> 01:42:56.638
Let's calm--

01:42:56.671 --> 01:43:00.342
all right,
all right, all right.

01:43:00.375 --> 01:43:01.676
All right.

01:43:10.918 --> 01:43:14.322
( whispering )
All right, all right.

01:43:14.356 --> 01:43:16.224
All right.

01:43:24.599 --> 01:43:26.668
Unlock it.

01:43:35.877 --> 01:43:36.978
( exhales deeply )

01:43:37.011 --> 01:43:40.248
Is there anyone at your place?

01:43:40.282 --> 01:43:41.516
Not tonight.

01:43:41.549 --> 01:43:42.784
Good.

01:43:42.817 --> 01:43:44.619
Drive there.

01:43:44.652 --> 01:43:46.954
Drive slowly.

01:43:46.988 --> 01:43:49.324
Don't try to get stopped.

01:43:49.357 --> 01:43:50.558
All right.

01:44:19.687 --> 01:44:21.956
He was making it with
my wife, Dr. Fowler.

01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:33.801
Don't talk.

01:45:00.562 --> 01:45:03.398
Let's go to the back door.

01:45:03.431 --> 01:45:05.299
Keep your mouth shut.

01:45:13.775 --> 01:45:15.710
Turn the light on.

01:45:20.948 --> 01:45:22.584
Where's your suitcase?

01:45:22.617 --> 01:45:23.551
My suitcase?

01:45:23.585 --> 01:45:25.086
Yeah. Where is it?

01:45:25.119 --> 01:45:26.988
Uh, in the bedroom closet.

01:45:27.021 --> 01:45:29.424
Okay, that's where
we're going.

01:45:29.457 --> 01:45:32.894
When you come to a door,
stop and turn the light on.

01:45:32.927 --> 01:45:34.562
Let's go.

01:45:58.119 --> 01:46:00.955
There's no wall switch.

01:46:00.988 --> 01:46:02.624
Where's the light?

01:46:02.657 --> 01:46:04.526
By the bed.

01:46:04.559 --> 01:46:06.360
Go ahead.

01:46:13.668 --> 01:46:16.671
Sit down on the bed.

01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:27.815
Which closet is it?

01:46:27.849 --> 01:46:30.685
Where are the suitcases?

01:46:46.868 --> 01:46:50.104
I wanted to work things out
with Natalie,

01:46:50.137 --> 01:46:52.674
try to get back together again

01:46:52.707 --> 01:46:56.911
but I couldn't--
I couldn't even talk to her.

01:46:56.944 --> 01:46:59.614
He was always with her.

01:46:59.647 --> 01:47:01.182
Dr. Fowler,
it was an accident.

01:47:01.215 --> 01:47:03.017
I'm going to jail
to pay for it.

01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:05.453
If I ever get out,
I'll be an old man.

01:47:05.487 --> 01:47:07.121
Isn't that enough?

01:47:07.154 --> 01:47:08.656
You're not going to jail.

01:47:11.526 --> 01:47:13.561
Pack clothes for warm weather.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.836
Y-you're going to let me go?

01:47:21.869 --> 01:47:24.672
You're going to jump bail.

01:47:24.706 --> 01:47:26.674
What?

01:47:26.708 --> 01:47:28.242
Go ahead.

01:47:28.275 --> 01:47:29.711
Go ahead.

01:47:29.744 --> 01:47:31.613
All right, all right.

01:47:34.849 --> 01:47:37.819
See, it's, uh
it's the trial.

01:47:37.852 --> 01:47:40.522
We can't go through that,
my wife and I.

01:47:40.555 --> 01:47:42.924
That's why you're leaving.
I've got you a ticket.

01:47:45.593 --> 01:47:49.196
My wife keeps seeing you.
I can't have that anymore.

01:47:51.866 --> 01:47:53.668
Thank you, Dr. Fowler.

01:48:01.609 --> 01:48:04.612
I'd go pick up my boys,
and he'd be there.

01:48:04.646 --> 01:48:07.582
Sometimes he spent the night.

01:48:07.615 --> 01:48:09.684
Duncan told me.

01:48:09.717 --> 01:48:10.785
I'm sorry, doctor.

01:48:10.818 --> 01:48:12.687
All right, that's enough.

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:13.788
I, uh...

01:48:13.821 --> 01:48:15.990
I need some things
from the bathroom.

01:48:34.642 --> 01:48:35.743
Keep walking.

01:48:35.777 --> 01:48:39.080
I got to pee.

01:48:39.113 --> 01:48:40.682
Go ahead.

01:48:45.319 --> 01:48:47.054
( foot kicks door)

01:48:48.122 --> 01:48:49.824
( zipper unzips )

01:48:54.662 --> 01:48:58.766
( urinating )

01:49:21.155 --> 01:49:22.590
Wait.

01:49:31.198 --> 01:49:33.000
Let's go.

01:49:37.238 --> 01:49:38.339
You know they'll catch me.

01:49:38.372 --> 01:49:40.675
They're going to check
passenger lists.

01:49:40.708 --> 01:49:42.309
I didn't use your name.

01:49:42.343 --> 01:49:43.510
They'll figure that out, too.

01:49:43.544 --> 01:49:47.114
You think I wouldn't have done
it myself if it was that easy?

01:49:47.148 --> 01:49:51.085
You were alone.
We got it worked out.

01:49:51.118 --> 01:49:52.887
Who's we?

01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:55.222
Start the engine.
Let's go.

01:50:08.670 --> 01:50:12.039
There's no planes
this time of night, Dr. Fowler.

01:50:12.073 --> 01:50:14.776
Go north on 73.

01:50:16.210 --> 01:50:17.378
The airport's south.

01:50:17.411 --> 01:50:21.883
Someone's going
to keep you a while.

01:50:21.916 --> 01:50:24.018
They'll take you
to the airport.

01:50:26.187 --> 01:50:29.223
Turn the radio on.

01:50:29.256 --> 01:50:30.792
Find the game.

01:50:30.825 --> 01:50:32.794
I-it's after 1:00.

01:50:32.827 --> 01:50:35.730
They run it again.

01:50:35.763 --> 01:50:37.699
No more talking.

01:50:37.732 --> 01:50:40.301
( rock music playing )

01:50:40.334 --> 01:50:42.303
( dialing stations )

01:50:42.336 --> 01:50:44.338
( crowd cheering )

01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:48.342
Sportscaster: Let's see,
the last Red Sox player

01:50:48.375 --> 01:50:50.344
to have a three-home-run game
would have been Trot Nixon

01:50:50.377 --> 01:50:51.879
last year at Detroit.

01:50:56.718 --> 01:50:59.053
Nomar had one
previous to that.

01:50:59.086 --> 01:51:02.957
Off with a fast ball.
Ball one.

01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:05.192
Galarraga holds
against Daubach at first.

01:51:05.226 --> 01:51:08.062
The outfield swung
around to their left.

01:51:08.095 --> 01:51:11.132
And a ground-ball roller
to shortstop.

01:51:11.165 --> 01:51:13.334
Flip to second,
they force Daubach.

01:51:13.367 --> 01:51:16.771
6-4 on the force,
Garciaparra.

01:51:16.804 --> 01:51:19.440
Actually hit into a force play
to end the inning.

01:51:19.473 --> 01:51:21.943
6-4 to get Daubach
at second.

01:51:21.976 --> 01:51:24.245
The inning is over.
Red Sox have left seven.

01:51:24.278 --> 01:51:27.949
After six, the Red Sox 7,
the Braves 2.

01:51:27.982 --> 01:51:30.718
on the WEEI
Red Sox radio network.

01:52:13.928 --> 01:52:16.864
Hit the scoring run,
there, one for two.

01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:23.037
Six for ten with a home run,
three RBIs in the series.

01:52:25.372 --> 01:52:27.074
Hits one into the air.

01:52:27.108 --> 01:52:29.010
Turn around.

01:52:29.043 --> 01:52:30.177
Why?

01:52:30.211 --> 01:52:32.346
- We missed it! Turn around!
- Okay.

01:52:32.379 --> 01:52:34.348
That's like using a
rolled-up newspaper

01:52:34.381 --> 01:52:36.283
for that hit.

01:52:41.823 --> 01:52:44.025
Sanders is up.
Homered his first time.

01:52:44.058 --> 01:52:47.561
One for two.
His fourth of the year.

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:49.797
( sportscaster continues
indistinctly )

01:53:07.314 --> 01:53:10.417
There's nothing back here,
Dr. Fowler.

01:53:10.451 --> 01:53:14.188
I don't understand why we don't
just drive to the airport.

01:53:14.221 --> 01:53:16.290
You don't think
we'd leave your car

01:53:16.323 --> 01:53:18.826
at the airport, do you?

01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:21.195
Knuckleball over the
inside corner for strike two.

01:53:21.228 --> 01:53:23.564
I'll get 20 years,
Dr. Fowler.

01:53:23.597 --> 01:53:25.933
I'll be 53 years old.

01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:31.338
That's a year younger
than I am now.

01:53:31.372 --> 01:53:33.007
Here's the pitch.

01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:36.878
Inside. Just missed.
The crowd groans.

01:53:36.911 --> 01:53:39.380
Where are we?

01:53:39.413 --> 01:53:41.248
Almost there.

01:53:49.390 --> 01:53:51.525
Turn it off.
Leave the lights on.

01:53:55.462 --> 01:53:57.865
Is this your cabin,
Dr. Fowler?

01:53:57.899 --> 01:54:00.467
No, it isn't.
Let's get the bags.

01:54:09.977 --> 01:54:12.346
( vehicle door opens )

01:54:20.021 --> 01:54:21.455
Mr. Grinnel.

01:54:21.488 --> 01:54:23.090
I'll get them, son.

01:54:26.994 --> 01:54:28.062
Wait.

01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:35.236
You can take this.

01:54:49.483 --> 01:54:51.352
( running footsteps )

01:54:51.385 --> 01:54:52.553
Matt!

01:54:55.556 --> 01:54:56.958
Matt!

01:55:00.461 --> 01:55:02.396
What did you do?

01:55:02.429 --> 01:55:04.398
This isn't what
we talked about.

01:55:08.102 --> 01:55:09.203
He, um...

01:55:12.506 --> 01:55:14.541
He tried to run.

01:55:17.311 --> 01:55:21.415
We were going to wait
and take him out in the woods.

01:55:27.721 --> 01:55:29.490
I couldn't wait.

01:55:37.198 --> 01:55:39.600
I better get the ATV.

01:56:15.536 --> 01:56:18.539
( thunder rumbling )

01:56:18.572 --> 01:56:20.474
( rain falling )

01:56:33.220 --> 01:56:34.321
Wait.

01:56:34.355 --> 01:56:37.424
( twig snaps )

01:56:55.376 --> 01:56:56.643
Come on.
We got to go.

01:57:15.829 --> 01:57:18.332
( boat approaching )

01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:44.858
( metallic clanking )

01:57:44.891 --> 01:57:47.094
Come on. Go.

01:58:04.578 --> 01:58:07.714
( train whistle blows
in distance )

01:58:22.396 --> 01:58:23.630
What time is it?

01:58:26.233 --> 01:58:28.569
It's ten to 4:00.

01:58:28.602 --> 01:58:30.504
We lost an hour.

01:58:30.537 --> 01:58:32.573
I'm sorry.

01:58:32.606 --> 01:58:34.508
Yeah.

01:58:34.541 --> 01:58:36.543
High tide.

01:58:36.577 --> 01:58:39.513
Can't stop people
from fishing, Matt.

01:58:40.614 --> 01:58:41.648
Fucking bridge.

01:58:41.682 --> 01:58:43.484
I'm sorry, Willis.

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:53.527
Stopped into his
little shed there once.

01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:56.197
Place reeked.

01:58:56.230 --> 01:58:58.832
The guy spilled more whiskey
than we've ever drunk.

01:59:00.767 --> 01:59:03.504
We'll just pray he's already
three sheets to the wind.

01:59:08.942 --> 01:59:11.412
Katie's pill will
be wearing off soon.

02:01:24.077 --> 02:01:26.547
( quietly ) Okay.

02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:29.750
Okay. Okay.

02:01:50.737 --> 02:01:53.306
All right.

02:02:54.435 --> 02:02:56.537
Did you do it?

02:03:38.679 --> 02:03:40.881
( whispering )
Are you all right, Matt?

02:03:52.025 --> 02:03:55.962
There was a picture of him
and Natalie on the wall.

02:04:03.737 --> 02:04:06.106
What is it, Matt?

02:04:11.277 --> 02:04:13.880
The way she was smiling

02:04:17.818 --> 02:04:19.686
What?

02:04:26.059 --> 02:04:28.829
I don't know.

02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:41.508
Matt.

02:05:00.326 --> 02:05:03.597
What am I thinking?

02:05:03.630 --> 02:05:06.567
You must be hungry.

02:05:12.573 --> 02:05:14.575
( Ruth descending stairs )

02:05:29.690 --> 02:05:31.925
Ruth: Matt?

02:05:35.696 --> 02:05:37.564
Matt?

02:05:37.598 --> 02:05:40.066
Do you want coffee?

02:06:02.022 --> 02:06:07.027
( long sigh )

02:06:15.936 --> 02:06:18.571
( dog barking in distance )
