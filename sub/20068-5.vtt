36:07.933 --> 36:09.332
want to show it, but he's in
serious pain, and an injury

36:09.334 --> 36:12.302
serious pain, and an injury
like a hernia could jeopardize

36:12.304 --> 36:13.737

their entire season before it

36:13.739 --> 36:15.705
their entire season before it
even starts.

 boat, but they've barely spoken
to each other since their

37:15.334 --> 37:17.300
And Liz feels awful about
what happened.

37:43.394 --> 37:46.296

mean any of that.

37:59.493 --> 38:02.912
>> NARRATOR: It was a much-
needed heart-to-heart.

38:07.518 --> 38:10.053

38:18.429 --> 38:21.865
It's the line they set for
Macho Man...

39:07.645 --> 39:10.413
(Liz groans)
(gator growls)

39:14.385 --> 39:16.853

And sure enough...
>> JESSICA: Whoa.

40:00.781 --> 40:03.850

a huge bubble trail.

40:26.757 --> 40:30.360
The girls are determined not
to lose this beast again.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.800
(Jessica gasps)

40:41.839 --> 40:45.775
(gator growling)
(gunshot)

>> NARRATOR: It's a 12-foot,

40:55.987 --> 40:57.954
>> NARRATOR: It's a 12-foot,
600-pound behemoth...

41:00.057 --> 41:02.091
(both whoop)
>> NARRATOR: ...and will bring

41:02.093 --> 41:03.893

It's a happy ending

41:06.665 --> 41:08.631
It's a happy ending
to a troublesome day.

41:11.001 --> 41:16.706

to fill, Liz and Jessica won't
have time for arguing.

If they hope to tag out this
season, they'll have to work

41:24.816 --> 41:26.749
season, they'll have to work
like a well-oiled machine.
