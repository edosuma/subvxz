00:33.618 --> 00:37.497
I can't possibly run 1.5 kilometres
to my house.

00:38.039 --> 00:41.543
That's why I have to trot.

00:42.293 --> 00:46.380
And I can sense as if someone's
following me.

00:46.589 --> 00:50.718
I don't hear footsteps. But I have
this horrible feeling.

00:52.929 --> 00:56.472
She was found between the village
and the hospital.

00:56.474 --> 01:00.436
The village is located a bit further.

01:00.603 --> 01:02.144
They found her right there.

01:02.146 --> 01:07.401
She was sitting in the bushes,
completely naked.

01:07.652 --> 01:09.737
With her clothes neatly folded
beside her.

01:11.322 --> 01:16.951
Only then, the police and other
authorities arrived.

01:16.953 --> 01:21.749
They started investigation. But no one
could explain why she died.

01:24.961 --> 01:29.299
They said he took off his clothes
and died in the forest.

01:29.632 --> 01:34.303
The locals told us that he was naked,
and there were markings on him.

01:34.971 --> 01:38.600
I guess someone was torturing him.

01:38.975 --> 01:40.727
But nobody knows who did it.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.313
It was also shown in the news
on TV.

01:46.691 --> 01:49.316
I don't run, but I walk
really fast.

01:49.318 --> 01:54.448
I walk very fast, but I can always
feel someone's behind me.

01:54.699 --> 01:56.951
- And you don't hear anything?
- I don't.

01:57.285 --> 02:01.623
But I'm afraid to turn my head.
I'm afraid I'd get scared and fall.

02:02.206 --> 02:07.962
I feel that there's something about
15-20 metres from me.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.798
As if there's someone
really close.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.715
- Someone's following you.
- Exactly.

02:12.717 --> 02:15.011
And is staring at me from
behind my back.

02:17.054 --> 02:21.724
There are entities who can take you
with them.

02:21.726 --> 02:28.316
In our village, there was only one
person who died that way.

02:29.567 --> 02:31.567
Everyone kept their distance
from her.

02:31.569 --> 02:37.533
People wouldn't even run cattle
near her house.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.492
She hanged herself.

02:40.494 --> 02:44.540
The village told her: this is for what
she has done.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.810
Can you feel your legs?
Can you move?

03:06.937 --> 03:09.064
Sit tight. We're gonna pull you out
of here.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.987
Viktoria, can I ask you a
question?

03:15.863 --> 03:18.157
Why do you rescue people?

03:18.449 --> 03:19.948
Everybody has their own
reasons.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.617
Someone has to do it, right?

03:21.619 --> 03:23.913
Go talk to Andrey. It's my first call
of the day.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.083
Hold him.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.919
Hold him tighter.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.294
Brace his leg.

03:32.296 --> 03:34.340
- Lie still.
- I need a bandage.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.095
Shit. He's got a lacerated
artery.

03:44.642 --> 03:45.935
Here... it's a decent mirror.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.687
Viktoria, you couldn't save
that person's life today.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.064
How do you feel?

03:50.231 --> 03:52.815
- I need a strap.
- We don't have any... just a bandage wrap.

03:52.817 --> 03:53.776
Damn it!

03:53.984 --> 03:55.235
Take off your belt.
Quick!

03:55.778 --> 03:57.405
I don't think that's a fair
question.

03:57.822 --> 03:59.532
Come on. It wasn't real.

04:01.951 --> 04:03.286
Lie still. Don't move.

04:05.121 --> 04:06.080
Time's up.

04:06.497 --> 04:07.663
Time's up, guys.

04:07.665 --> 04:08.624
Your time's over.

04:09.667 --> 04:13.087
So, the victim died due to
blood loss.

04:14.338 --> 04:15.589
Damn it.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.841
Get up, Alexey. I didn't save you,
again.

04:19.844 --> 04:20.803
Never mind.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.722
It's hard to die so many times
in one day.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.515
Has anybody seen my cigarettes?

04:26.517 --> 04:29.017
You can smoke later. Get the stretcher
ready.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.146
We'll get started on evacuating
the dead body.

04:31.856 --> 04:34.901
Visibility in the forest is about
20-30 metres.

04:35.109 --> 04:38.026
When we call out for a missing person,
it's about 200-300 metres.

04:38.028 --> 04:42.030
Providing that the person's awake
and can reply back to us.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.198
So we can hear him.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.952
Rescuers have a rule.

04:45.161 --> 04:47.703
Regardless of how many people
go missing,

04:47.705 --> 04:49.955
if we find someone who's still
alive,

04:49.957 --> 04:51.957
we have to hand him over to the
ambulance.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.794
Then we go back for the others.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.961
Because person's life is
irreplaceable.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.047
Cave rescue's one of the hardest things
to do, you know.

04:59.049 --> 05:03.679
Because we fight for people's lives in
a rough environment.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.683
We have this dummy here.

05:07.558 --> 05:08.684
It's the heaviest one.

05:08.893 --> 05:12.227
It'll be difficult to carry.

05:12.229 --> 05:15.524
The thing I hate the most about my job
is working with dead bodies.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.651
When you understand there's no one
to rescue,

05:17.860 --> 05:21.864
and all you can do is deliver the body
to the station and to their relatives.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.198
Okay, looks like we're ready.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.324
Yeah, I'm done.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.786
- Ready to lift him up?
- Yes.

05:27.745 --> 05:28.996
Careful! Hold it tighter.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.207
Be careful... it's slippery.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.710
The biggest mistake you can make

05:35.085 --> 05:38.253
is to wait 24 hours before starting
the search for a missing person.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.215
Every hour that passes can
cost somebody's life.

05:40.424 --> 05:41.634
Keep holding it.

05:43.552 --> 05:44.511
Careful.

05:48.933 --> 05:51.519
- Should I stand closer to the water?
- No, that's okay.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.230
- Stay right there.
- Are you sure? Okay, then.

05:54.438 --> 05:58.150
Our team conducts searches for people
who go missing in the wild.

05:58.609 --> 06:03.364
In other words, in forests, swamps...
And, of course, in caves.

06:04.907 --> 06:05.866
Watch your head.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.075
Go, go, go.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.162
Look, it caved in.

06:11.872 --> 06:12.831
Careful.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.253
Guys, stop.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.256
Easy now... here we go.

06:21.757 --> 06:22.925
This way's also caved in.

06:23.801 --> 06:24.925
Is it completely blocked?

06:24.927 --> 06:26.969
There used to be a passage here.
It's blocked now.

06:26.971 --> 06:31.058
If you go into the woods, it's better to
wear something bright and colourful.

06:31.225 --> 06:34.520
Something like this. Yellow, orange,
or red.

06:34.937 --> 06:36.689
Don't wear camouflage to the forest.

06:36.939 --> 06:38.774
And don't forget to charge
your phone.

06:38.983 --> 06:42.445
It will be easier for us to find you,
if you follow these simple rules.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.364
It's blocked.

06:45.781 --> 06:46.740
Wait.

06:46.991 --> 06:48.618
Stop, stop.
I'll go check.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.413
Where are you going?

06:53.789 --> 06:54.748
Viktoria!

06:55.916 --> 06:59.461
- Should I look at the camera?
- No, just relax. Act natural.

07:00.671 --> 07:04.800
Well, actually heroism can be
life-threatening.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.926
We strictly try to avoid it.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.140
Because a rescuer's main principle
says

07:11.307 --> 07:13.348
that you mustn't increase the number
of injured.

07:13.350 --> 07:17.102
Recently, our work efficiency
has improved so significantly

07:17.104 --> 07:20.774
that EMERCOM now oficially redirects
some of their calls to us.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.279
- Here, this way.
- No need to hurry... crawl slowly.

07:27.031 --> 07:28.324
Need a hand?

07:31.035 --> 07:32.995
That's okay, just a little
crawlway.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.996
- I'm stuck.
- Easy, easy.

07:35.372 --> 07:36.999
Life's been hard on Yukon.

07:37.708 --> 07:41.170
I rescued him from a fire that
killed his owner.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.922
He's trained to search for people.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.008
People who are alive.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.177
Because search for the dead is
another field.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.680
He doesn't do that. He only searches
for the living.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.975
Wait, stop. Your harness is stuck.
Go back just a bit.

07:55.184 --> 07:56.143
Just a little.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.519
That's right.

07:58.187 --> 07:59.146
That's it.

07:59.563 --> 08:01.148
Now, take a few breaths.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.858
And exhale.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.820
Breathe in, breathe out.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.530
Strong exhales. Stronger.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.867
Come on, here we go.
You're almost out.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.075
Just a bit more. Great.

08:13.077 --> 08:14.036
Good job.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.540
That's it. Congrats on your first
climb.

08:19.083 --> 08:21.377
- Can you tell about the beacon?
- Right, the beacon.

08:22.086 --> 08:26.382
The beacon is for working at dusk,
in the dark, or fog.

08:26.757 --> 08:29.885
When there's bad visibility,
just like in these caves.

08:31.011 --> 08:31.970
Careful.

08:32.929 --> 08:33.889
Easy.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.222
Are you holding it?

08:43.440 --> 08:45.150
- Let me get through.
- Sure.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.154
That's quite the warehouse
you've got here.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.489
Yeah. I'm doing a check of the filming
equipment.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.911
- Is that a GoPro?
- Yes, I brought two.

08:56.578 --> 08:58.914
You can wear this one
on your head.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.290
This is the main camera. It can even
record in total darkness.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.503
Why did you come by yourself?
Where's your cameraman?

09:04.795 --> 09:07.089
He was assigned to another project
at the last minute.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.424
What did I have to do?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.342
I can't go back now, right?

09:11.385 --> 09:15.014
If you need any help,
let me know.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.432
Well, help me, then.

09:17.808 --> 09:19.935
- Ilya, is the camera rolling?
- Yeah, it's rolling.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.605
My name's Kristina Erofeeva.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.814
We're now watching the search
and rescue team ISKRA

09:25.816 --> 09:28.902
train their new volunteer
how to provide first aid

09:29.111 --> 09:30.444
to the injured underground.

09:30.446 --> 09:34.283
And just 100 kilometers from here,
the annual...

09:36.493 --> 09:38.704
I think I'll start with the second
part, okay?

09:39.163 --> 09:42.041
And let's turn around to
face the cave.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.795
We've just seen the newest
European technological system

09:46.962 --> 09:50.966
that imitates heavy, realistic
bleeding.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.136
Thanks to support from the sponsors
and volunteer work

09:54.344 --> 09:56.930
our rescuers are able to practice
their skills

09:57.264 --> 09:59.475
in the field...

10:01.310 --> 10:02.478
Hey, are you okay?

10:02.853 --> 10:04.146
Yes, we're coming.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.319
Andrey, do you copy?

10:11.528 --> 10:12.821
Yes, I can hear you.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.323
We have an urgent call.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.658
A boy went missing not far from
your caves.

10:16.825 --> 10:20.327
He's about 14 years old. He went to
the forest with his little brother.

10:20.329 --> 10:23.958
His brother came back. He's in shock,
he can't explain what happened.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.957
Wrap up your training.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.419
You're the closest to that site.

10:27.878 --> 10:31.256
Another group should be able to
join you to help by midnight.

10:31.715 --> 10:32.841
Do you copy?

10:33.217 --> 10:34.260
Andrey?

10:34.551 --> 10:37.345
Copy. I got it. I confirm:
We're taking your call.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.848
We're waiting for location details.
Bye.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.016
Going offline.

11:13.090 --> 11:16.341
There, that's where the kids crossed
the road and went into the forest.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.345
That's where they were seen by
loggers.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.514
There's only swamp and then
the woods after that.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.724
That's where we'll start.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.017
That's a huge search area.
We won't find him.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.895
How far is it from there to
the nearest village?

11:27.271 --> 11:30.399
Look. The village they came from
is 15 kilometres south.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.568
Here, on the riverside, is
a sawmill.

11:34.611 --> 11:37.531
If we zoom out, there's a big swamp
over here.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.409
Actually, that's a godforsaken
spot.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.370
Now, we're studying the map.

11:43.745 --> 11:47.207
It seems the terrain's rather
difficult.

11:52.129 --> 11:54.590
- Can you drive more carefully?
- You nearly killed the dog.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.259
Not gonna happen. We're in a Russian
car, remember?

12:12.733 --> 12:15.361
Okay, this is the spot. We set off
in 5 minutes.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.409
Can you look at me, please?

12:23.744 --> 12:25.204
Perfect. You look beautiful.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.457
Ilya, where's the tablet?

12:29.958 --> 12:31.543
It's here, in the car.

12:32.169 --> 12:36.338
Can you turn it on, please? I need to
see if Viktoria's camera's working.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.299
What do you need that for?

12:37.507 --> 12:38.883
Viktoria, can you turn toward me?

12:39.301 --> 12:40.469
Step a bit closer.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.636
The red light's on. It's working.

12:42.638 --> 12:44.223
Ilya, I'm not asking for much.
Please.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.266
- Fine.
- It'll only take a second.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.515
Just a moment.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.227
Do you have a basic connection
code?

12:50.354 --> 12:51.730
What is it... four zeros?

12:53.607 --> 12:56.068
Damn, there are so many useless
things in the car.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.986
- Is it a gun?
- A flare gun.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.280
It was made in the last century.
Made in Germany.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.823
They knew how to make these.

13:02.032 --> 13:02.991
- Alexey?
- Huh?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.284
What's this?

13:04.493 --> 13:06.453
That's a search horn.

13:06.620 --> 13:10.833
You put it on a car, and it lets the lost
person understand where we are.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.219
Guys, we're entering the
search zone.

14:04.428 --> 14:07.473
we'll call out his name and wait
for a response.

14:09.391 --> 14:10.517
Nikita!

14:11.935 --> 14:13.562
Viktoria, look at the camera.

14:19.234 --> 14:21.069
- Is Yukon following something?
- Not yet.

14:22.279 --> 14:23.238
Nikita!

14:28.785 --> 14:30.203
Keep your eyes peeled.

14:30.912 --> 14:31.913
Pay attention.

14:33.123 --> 14:36.501
The search team is now calling out
the missing boy's name.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.003
Nikita!

14:38.211 --> 14:40.588
Our horn's broken and isn't
working.

14:41.256 --> 14:42.924
We're walking through the bush.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.720
Nikita, hey-oh!

14:51.641 --> 14:53.852
The sawmill where the boy was seen is
northward.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.063
And there's a path 5 metres from
here.

14:56.313 --> 14:57.606
Let's split up.

14:58.315 --> 15:00.776
I'll take Yukon to follow the
trail.

15:01.651 --> 15:05.403
Alexey and Viktoria, go check
that path over there.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.240
But stay within 5 metres of
each other.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.618
To stay in each other's field of vision,
okay?

15:10.994 --> 15:12.245
Okay. Now disperse.

15:12.621 --> 15:15.413
Don't forget about staying within
each other's field of vision.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.374
Come here, Yukon.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.303
Nikita!

15:32.182 --> 15:34.142
Nikita!

15:35.769 --> 15:37.145
The sun's already going down.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.314
It'll be dark soon.

15:39.815 --> 15:41.734
Nikita!

15:44.861 --> 15:47.072
Listen, it's useless. We're not going
to find anyone.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.282
Why?

15:49.658 --> 15:52.661
Over the last 3 years I've been on
more than 100 missions.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.288
We haven't found anyone yet.
I guess I'm unlucky.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.833
What if I'm the key to success?
Beginner's luck, you know.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.125
You think so?

15:59.292 --> 16:00.708
- Yes.
- Well, I don't know.

16:00.710 --> 16:01.836
Nikita.

16:06.550 --> 16:07.882
- Alexey?
- Huh?

16:07.884 --> 16:08.927
Do you smell that?

16:09.386 --> 16:10.429
What?

16:10.637 --> 16:11.596
Something's burning.

16:13.890 --> 16:17.310
I don't smell anything.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.458
Play with me.

16:47.591 --> 16:48.550
Viktoria...

17:24.752 --> 17:25.712
Is it ready?

17:26.253 --> 17:27.714
Keep her legs down.

17:28.214 --> 17:32.300
We found a naked old woman
in the forest. She's in shock.

17:32.302 --> 17:35.136
And she can't explain what happened to
her.

17:35.138 --> 17:38.973
There are no visible injuries or damage
to her body.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.685
We couldn't find her clothes.

17:41.311 --> 17:46.441
We also have no explanation of why
there was a children's toy at the site.

17:46.816 --> 17:52.447
Right now, we're looking at the rescuers
urgently transporting the woman

17:52.739 --> 17:54.199
to the vehicle.

17:54.616 --> 17:58.159
From there, she'll be transported to
a hospital.

17:58.161 --> 18:01.915
And we still know nothing about
the whereabouts of the lost boy.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.085
Guys...

18:16.012 --> 18:17.096
Gosh.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.557
Come on, stand up.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.446
Stop. She's having convulsions.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.656
Put her on the ground.

18:35.699 --> 18:37.117
- Hold her head.
- Okay.

18:37.534 --> 18:39.494
- She's not breathing.
- I'm holding her.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.080
- Hold her head.
- I'm holding it.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.457
Let's open her mouth to
take a look.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.084
Get out of here.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.420
Let's look what's in her mouth.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.089
There's something in there.
Ilya, shine your light on her.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.841
I'll pull it out.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.306
- Give me a knife.
- A knife? You'll break her teeth.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.475
Hold it. Open her mouth.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.686
- Open the mouth.
- Careful with the chin.

19:09.858 --> 19:11.151
What the hell is that?

19:17.657 --> 19:18.616
Is she breathing?

19:19.075 --> 19:20.201
Looks like it.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.380
That woman just about bit
my fingers off.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.716
Make it tighter.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.052
I have another bandage,
just in case.

19:39.262 --> 19:41.306
Just don't stick your fingers
in her mouth.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.391
- How is she?
- I'll go check.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.227
Miss, can you hear us?

19:46.102 --> 19:48.019
She has to make it to the
hospital at least.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.023
- She will.
- Maybe we can give her some pills?

19:50.231 --> 19:52.233
- We can't. Are you crazy?
- Why not?

19:52.942 --> 19:57.321
Because she can overdose if you give
her some medicine.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.241
Or she'll have an allergic
reaction.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.532
And then they'll drag you to court
for doing that.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.162
You can only give her pills
that she has on her.

20:04.579 --> 20:05.997
The rest is too risky.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.749
Wrap it up once again, please.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.334
Alexey.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.253
You got a signal?

20:11.795 --> 20:12.754
It's bad, you know.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.090
Because we're in a low place.

20:25.642 --> 20:26.601
Did you hear that?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.104
Guys, it came from that side.

20:30.647 --> 20:34.276
Let's take the stretcher and go see
what's going on over there.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.070
- Ilya, go to that side.
- Okay.

20:39.447 --> 20:42.450
- Watch out for the trees.
- Careful, don't drop her.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.581
- Nikita!
- Alexey, where the hell are you going?

20:49.791 --> 20:50.750
Alexey.

20:50.959 --> 20:51.918
Alexey.

21:09.352 --> 21:10.311
Alexey?

21:14.524 --> 21:15.483
There's nothing here.

21:15.692 --> 21:18.320
It's probably just the trees creaking
because of the wind.

21:18.528 --> 21:20.655
Meanwhile, the team went after
a dead-end lead.

21:21.030 --> 21:23.449
At the moment, every minute
is critical.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.827
- Ilya.
- What?

21:26.286 --> 21:27.245
Look.

21:28.538 --> 21:29.581
That's strange.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.336
Looks like a frog.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.839
Not exactly. It's not really
a frog.

21:38.381 --> 21:41.549
Back in the day, villagers used to
leave icons or crosses

21:41.551 --> 21:43.845
on dry tree trunks.

21:44.012 --> 21:46.471
They did it to show either the way
to a sacred,

21:46.473 --> 21:47.683
or an evil place.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.268
Judging by this one,
it's an evil place.

21:50.685 --> 21:53.688
Look at its pointed head.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.692
It's typical for evil spirits.

21:57.233 --> 22:00.027
The only thing that's strange here...

22:00.403 --> 22:03.364
are these deformed, bent legs.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.370
Villagers would say it's not a
good sign.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.706
- That's bullshit.
- Team, we're all together now.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.875
Let's go. We don't have much
time.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.171
Are you ready?

22:18.922 --> 22:19.881
Lift her up. Quickly.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.008
Done.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.222
Watch your step, be careful.

22:35.772 --> 22:36.856
Are we going the right way?

22:37.190 --> 22:39.234
It's easy to get lost in
such a place.

22:39.776 --> 22:43.154
Yes. I also have the feeling that
we're going around in circles.

22:43.363 --> 22:46.364
We've been on a rescue mission
to save this woman

22:46.366 --> 22:47.534
for more than 3 hours.

22:47.742 --> 22:49.784
The team's getting tired,
but we continue...

22:49.786 --> 22:51.913
Don't get in the way, please.
Enough of that filming.

22:52.247 --> 22:56.501
There are days where we walk for 8 hours
and then go to work afterward.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.253
Easy, easy. Not so fast.

22:59.754 --> 23:00.713
Lift it higher.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.382
Alright.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.385
Be careful. Easy.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.430
Let's go one at a time.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.683
Ilya, pull it toward me.

23:15.937 --> 23:16.896
Come on down.

23:19.649 --> 23:21.693
Okay, guys. Let's put her
in the back.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.277
Come on.

23:26.823 --> 23:29.117
- Let's put something warm on her.
- Push her in.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.580
Looks like she's still breathing.

23:49.012 --> 23:51.097
Guys, maybe it's none
of my business...

23:52.265 --> 23:54.559
but what are going to do about
the missing kid?

23:55.768 --> 23:57.603
Are we going to look for him?

23:57.979 --> 23:59.939
- Play with me.
- Remember the rule?

24:00.356 --> 24:02.775
We save the first one
who's found.

24:03.693 --> 24:04.652
Let's go.

24:40.897 --> 24:41.856
Shit.

24:46.653 --> 24:49.281
- Oh, come on. We're stuck.
- What's going on?

24:49.572 --> 24:51.324
The car's stuck.

24:51.491 --> 24:52.450
Give me some light.

25:00.667 --> 25:03.712
Yeah, the rear axle's stuck. Let me
wedge something under the van.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.714
I'll tell you when to push,
okay?

25:08.216 --> 25:09.467
Andrey, should I also get out?

25:09.676 --> 25:12.387
Stay with the woamn. Your weight
makes no difference.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.638
- Ready?
- Start the car.

25:24.065 --> 25:26.067
Keep pushing.

25:30.905 --> 25:33.199
- How heavy is this van?
- About 3 tons.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.249
- Did it move at all?
- No.

25:45.795 --> 25:47.171
I'll bring the tow strap.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.382
We'll haul it out.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.094
Ilya, can you hit the brights?
I can't see anything.

25:53.302 --> 25:54.261
Sure.

26:00.101 --> 26:01.892
It's ready. Is it tough
enough?

26:01.894 --> 26:04.605
It is. We've got only one tow strap.
It has to be tight.

26:07.650 --> 26:08.609
I hooked it.

26:25.835 --> 26:28.421
Get rid of those branches. Put some
solid log.

26:28.796 --> 26:30.504
- Alexey, do you hear me?
- Okay.

26:30.506 --> 26:32.633
- Put it under the wheel.
- Alright.

26:33.009 --> 26:34.928
- Under the wheel. Got it?
- Done.

26:35.344 --> 26:36.804
Step aside. I'll tow the car.

26:36.971 --> 26:39.180
Move away from the car.
The strap can break.

26:39.182 --> 26:40.266
Got it.

26:49.650 --> 26:50.609
And we're out.

26:55.698 --> 26:56.657
That's okay.

27:50.419 --> 27:51.712
What the hell is this?

27:53.589 --> 27:54.882
Let's go have a look.

28:15.945 --> 28:19.490
- The road's totally blocked.
- Yeah, this is a shitty situation.

28:20.408 --> 28:21.534
I'll bring the chainsaw.

28:23.786 --> 28:25.496
How are we going to
get through?

28:25.788 --> 28:27.581
Don't worry. We'll figure
something out.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.251
Hey, maybe we can take a detour.

28:30.793 --> 28:31.752
Wait in the van.

28:32.253 --> 28:34.005
We'll saw it up.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.013
Everything's okay.

28:43.723 --> 28:44.849
How are you feeling?

28:47.310 --> 28:51.356
We're the search and rescue team.
We found you in the forest.

28:52.481 --> 28:53.899
You're safe now.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.569
You're in our vehicle.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.030
I'm Viktoria. What is your name?

28:59.780 --> 29:01.031
Zoya.

29:01.616 --> 29:02.951
Can I have some water?

29:06.162 --> 29:07.121
Damn it.

29:17.089 --> 29:20.467
Now, no one gets out. No one can
leave this place.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.140
Zoya, what are you talking about?

29:30.519 --> 29:33.605
The lame Widow's leading us in
circles.

29:40.863 --> 29:43.991
It started a long time ago.
Before the war began.

29:45.034 --> 29:48.496
There used to be a peasant's daughter
called Sofia.

29:48.829 --> 29:52.249
She choked her husband to death.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.668
Because he cheated on her.

29:55.044 --> 29:58.923
People began to scream at her...
Why did you kill your husband?

30:01.175 --> 30:03.177
They went crazy and caught her.

30:04.011 --> 30:07.598
They broke her legs with
an iron rod.

30:10.184 --> 30:12.687
They put her naked on a wagon.

30:13.521 --> 30:15.857
Then, they threw her to
a dark pit.

30:22.238 --> 30:24.071
- What was that?
- Everything's fine.

30:24.073 --> 30:25.658
It's probably just the wires.

30:26.742 --> 30:29.036
They drowned her in black ooze.

30:30.746 --> 30:34.208
People used to say that the night
before the Holy Virgin's Day

30:34.583 --> 30:37.795
evil was born deep
in the dark pit.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.350
Ilya?

30:57.940 --> 31:00.734
People began spreading rumors that

31:01.027 --> 31:06.491
the dead girl was wandering at night
on her broken legs.

31:07.366 --> 31:10.870
Killing people and taking their
clothes.

31:18.461 --> 31:22.382
People were scared to go into
the forest.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.844
Goddamn it, where are those guys?

31:27.595 --> 31:31.724
But the Widow from the
rotten earth

31:32.141 --> 31:34.101
will get her own way.

31:35.311 --> 31:37.522
She'll get her revenge.

31:38.272 --> 31:39.398
She'll do what?

31:40.900 --> 31:44.946
They threw her in the hole without
wrapping her in any linens.

31:47.156 --> 31:50.868
She's cold without clothes.

31:56.916 --> 32:01.462
The Widow won't let anyone leave
the forest.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.595
It's no use.

32:11.138 --> 32:14.767
That was quite a story. Hey, lady,
maybe you need some sleep?

32:16.811 --> 32:18.980
Alright. The situation's pretty
bad.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.440
I've never seen anything
like this before.

32:21.649 --> 32:25.486
It's completely blocked. There's no way
we can pass. I don't know what to do.

32:25.694 --> 32:26.904
The chainsaw's not working.

32:27.196 --> 32:28.447
Can we take a detour?

32:28.697 --> 32:31.658
Yeah. Look, here's an option.

32:32.326 --> 32:35.246
There's a side road leading to
the forest highway.

32:35.704 --> 32:38.498
I think that's how we can get to
the beginning of our route.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.124
What if we get lost?

32:40.126 --> 32:42.167
Can we start driving, please?

32:42.169 --> 32:45.255
We won't get lost... as long as we
don't miss our turn.

32:49.343 --> 32:50.511
The car's not starting.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.453
Okay, here we go.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.372
Ilya, give me the tablet.

33:58.579 --> 34:02.249
There shouldn't be a fork in the road
here according to the map.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.885
Just admit it. We're lost.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.094
Hell if I know.

34:14.428 --> 34:15.763
I'll go check this way.

34:16.138 --> 34:18.931
Just don't go alone.
Alexey, go with Viktoria.

34:19.475 --> 34:21.101
I'll check out this place.

34:21.268 --> 34:22.226
Ilya, can you help me?

34:22.393 --> 34:23.353
- Hold the camera.
- Okay.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.272
Let's go. Be careful with that.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.446
- Is it on?
- Yes.

34:32.821 --> 34:33.780
Let's go then.

34:34.322 --> 34:36.867
It's less than an hour before
October 14.

34:37.243 --> 34:40.955
In folklore, that day is called
the Holy Virgin's Day.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.916
Our ancestors believed that it's
the scariest night of the year

34:44.083 --> 34:48.129
when evil spirits commit horrors before
they hibernate until the spring.

34:48.337 --> 34:52.382
Of course, we know there's an explanation
to many of these scary legends.

34:52.841 --> 34:55.969
But when you're deep in the forest,
alone in the wild,

34:56.428 --> 34:59.306
you can't help but reconsider
folktales.

35:00.099 --> 35:04.061
What have we got ourselves into again?
I did say I'm not lucky.

35:04.645 --> 35:06.480
But we found a person, and
we're saving her.

35:06.855 --> 35:09.941
I hope we're not the ones who need
saving.

35:10.526 --> 35:11.485
What's that?

35:11.944 --> 35:14.155
It looks like some sort of
a haystack.

35:15.864 --> 35:16.823
It's so weird.

35:35.217 --> 35:38.178
- Look, there's another one.
- Where did they come from?

35:38.637 --> 35:41.014
It's creepy here.
Let's go back.

35:41.473 --> 35:42.432
Yeah. Let's go.

35:54.903 --> 35:55.862
Ilya.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.447
Alexey.

35:57.990 --> 35:59.700
Come back. I found the way back.

36:26.769 --> 36:29.313
- Is it deep?
- No, it should be fine.

36:30.064 --> 36:33.818
- Drive slowly.
- Slowly? Get in. We'll go quickly.

36:55.631 --> 36:57.716
- Is she breathing?
- I think so.

37:01.303 --> 37:03.555
Andrey, don't go too fast. The road's
a mess.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.851
If you ask me, I don't want to spend
the night in the forest.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.520
My wife's waiting for me.
But you...

37:09.812 --> 37:10.771
Andrey, stop.

37:14.817 --> 37:15.776
Is everyone okay?

37:16.443 --> 37:17.527
The door's stuck.

37:17.903 --> 37:18.862
What was that?

37:19.947 --> 37:21.198
I thought it was a bear.

37:21.490 --> 37:22.783
Are you kidding me?

37:23.283 --> 37:24.451
Let me have a look.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.039
Yukon, stop.

37:33.168 --> 37:34.127
Yukon.

37:34.420 --> 37:35.379
Yukon.

37:35.629 --> 37:38.004
- What's got into him?
- Maybe he's sniffing out someone.

37:38.006 --> 37:38.965
Let's go.

37:43.429 --> 37:45.139
- Kristina, wait.
- What now?

37:45.305 --> 37:46.264
Stay here.

37:46.515 --> 37:48.809
- But why?
- Because I said so. I need your help.

37:54.690 --> 37:56.150
So, what do I have to do?

37:56.483 --> 37:57.484
We'll figure it out.

38:00.028 --> 38:02.489
- Zoya, how are you?
- I'm fine.

38:03.782 --> 38:04.741
Okay, then.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.119
Yukon.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.289
- Why didn't Yukon smell Zoya?
- What do you mean?

38:11.039 --> 38:13.458
Well, you said he sniffs out people
who are alive.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.502
Hell if I know.

38:17.004 --> 38:18.088
Do you hear that?

38:29.850 --> 38:32.436
- Jesus. What are you doing here?
- I decided to join you.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.479
But Andrey told you to stay.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.148
He let me go.

38:36.732 --> 38:38.192
That's a bit suspicious.

38:40.903 --> 38:41.862
Yukon.

38:43.322 --> 38:45.572
- Watch out for the branches.
- Yukon.

38:45.574 --> 38:46.784
Don't poke your eyes out.

38:47.159 --> 38:49.787
Can you go faster?
Don't fall behind.

38:51.413 --> 38:54.041
That naked lady, the lost boy...

38:54.917 --> 38:57.628
Why was there a haystack in the middle
of the road?

38:57.836 --> 38:59.713
Yeah. It's like some kind of magic.

39:00.506 --> 39:02.800
Actually, naked people have been found
here before.

39:03.091 --> 39:05.385
I personally know about
two cases.

39:06.887 --> 39:07.888
Are you serious?

39:08.430 --> 39:09.763
Well, one case was...

39:09.765 --> 39:12.309
Wait, let me switch this on.
I hope it works.

39:12.684 --> 39:13.643
Yes, it's working.

39:31.411 --> 39:34.414
Can you pass me the wrench?
It's on my seat.

39:39.461 --> 39:40.420
Damn it.

39:40.963 --> 39:41.922
Kristina?

39:45.968 --> 39:46.927
Here you go.

39:57.312 --> 40:00.524
- Where's Kristina?
- She joined the guys 5 minutes ago.

40:02.943 --> 40:06.780
Five years ago, they found a logger's
body. He was completely naked.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.407
He was coming back from
his village.

40:10.158 --> 40:13.286
And he choked to death. Actually,
he drowned in mud.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.456
He had mud eveywhere...
in his mouth, nose...

40:16.915 --> 40:20.544
It looked like as if he was digging
the ground with his hands,

40:20.919 --> 40:22.546
and was trying to eat it.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.005
When did the second case
happen?

40:25.007 --> 40:25.966
Today.

40:26.300 --> 40:27.301
Hey, guys.

40:28.176 --> 40:29.469
Enough chit chat.

40:30.178 --> 40:31.304
I've found some trace.

40:32.180 --> 40:33.390
Come on, start.

40:36.685 --> 40:37.644
Start.

40:40.522 --> 40:42.482
Too bad we couldn't find
the boy.

40:42.858 --> 40:46.403
What the hell are you talking about?
We need to get out of here.

40:49.156 --> 40:51.158
Andrey, look. Andrey.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.118
Look. Yukon's back.

41:09.885 --> 41:10.844
Yukon?

41:19.561 --> 41:20.771
Where's your collar?

41:26.485 --> 41:27.695
Come here, Yukon.

41:28.695 --> 41:29.654
Yukon?

41:30.822 --> 41:31.781
Yukon.

41:33.742 --> 41:34.701
Yukon?

41:42.042 --> 41:43.001
Yukon.

41:49.257 --> 41:50.216
Yukon?

41:50.592 --> 41:51.551
Yukon.

41:52.094 --> 41:53.053
Yukon.

41:54.930 --> 41:56.763
Maybe his collar caught on
something?

41:56.765 --> 41:58.141
- How did he get in there?
- Yukon?

41:58.433 --> 41:59.559
I'll go find out.

42:00.268 --> 42:01.895
- Are you going in there?
- I'll try.

42:03.355 --> 42:04.314
Hold this.

42:04.606 --> 42:06.399
- Alexey, wait a sec.
- What?

42:06.608 --> 42:09.152
Hold the camera, please. Just a sec.
I'll put a GoPro on you.

42:09.945 --> 42:11.572
Okay, but do it quickly.

42:12.614 --> 42:13.907
Faster.

42:15.784 --> 42:17.160
- Is the light on?
- Yeah.

42:17.369 --> 42:18.537
Yes, it's on. Go.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.551
Do you copy? Can you hear me?

42:34.553 --> 42:37.137
Yes, I can hear you. Do you copy?
This is Viktoria.

42:37.139 --> 42:40.601
The second rescue team's close.
Tell me your coordinates.

42:41.226 --> 42:42.185
Do you copy?

42:42.894 --> 42:44.687
Our team leader...

42:51.820 --> 42:53.613
Do you copy? Can you hear me?

42:56.074 --> 42:57.909
Do you hear me? Hello?

42:58.326 --> 43:01.037
You shouldn't have taken me
with you.

43:02.080 --> 43:06.042
No one's getting out alive.

43:09.421 --> 43:10.380
Yukon?

43:11.423 --> 43:12.382
Yukon.

43:28.106 --> 43:29.065
Yukon.

43:36.448 --> 43:38.492
Yukon, are you here?

43:39.993 --> 43:41.286
- Alexey?
- Alexey?

43:42.037 --> 43:43.247
What do you see?

43:46.875 --> 43:50.754
The Widow will transform into you.
And then you'll die.

43:51.379 --> 43:53.339
Andrey, the radio set's working...

44:05.352 --> 44:09.648
Bright red sunrise, come and keep
the evil spirits away.

44:11.024 --> 44:14.861
Bright red sunrise, come and keep
the evil spirits away.

44:15.904 --> 44:18.031
- Bright red sunrise, come...
- Andrey?

44:18.657 --> 44:21.118
- ...and keep the evil spirits away.
- Andrey?

44:21.910 --> 44:26.456
Bright red sunrise, come and keep
the evil spirits away.

44:31.837 --> 44:36.342
Bright red sunrise, come and keep
the evil spirits away.

44:38.718 --> 44:43.306
Bright red sunrise, come and keep
the evil spirits away.

44:46.434 --> 44:49.395
The Widow won't let anyone
escape from the forest.

44:54.609 --> 44:55.568
Stop!

45:07.956 --> 45:08.915
Yukon?

45:10.625 --> 45:11.584
Yukon?

45:23.096 --> 45:24.055
Yukon?

45:55.795 --> 45:56.754
Yukon?

46:01.176 --> 46:02.135
Alexey?

46:03.511 --> 46:04.470
Alexey?

46:06.181 --> 46:07.641
Alexey, are you okay?

46:08.099 --> 46:09.475
- Alexey?
- Can you hear us?

46:09.684 --> 46:10.810
Alexey, come back.

46:12.437 --> 46:13.813
Do you hear me?

46:21.154 --> 46:23.406
Andrey, slow down.
Andrey!

46:24.491 --> 46:25.450
Andrey!

46:30.664 --> 46:31.623
Damn it.

46:48.390 --> 46:49.516
Where's Yukon?

46:50.558 --> 46:53.519
Maybe there's another entrance
on the other side.

46:53.979 --> 46:56.020
- There's no one in there.
- What do you mean?

46:56.022 --> 46:57.941
I only found a cell phone.

47:21.840 --> 47:22.841
Andrey!

47:23.550 --> 47:24.509
Andrey!

47:25.427 --> 47:27.346
No, please, no.

47:29.097 --> 47:30.056
Andrey...

47:42.068 --> 47:44.529
Why is the siren on? It wasn't
working before.

48:00.462 --> 48:01.421
Follow me.

48:42.420 --> 48:43.379
Andrey!

48:51.346 --> 48:53.098
Ilya, do you copy? We have
an emergency.

48:54.182 --> 48:55.141
Ilya?

48:55.308 --> 48:56.935
The scream came from over here.

48:59.270 --> 49:00.480
Viktoria?

49:00.688 --> 49:01.647
Andrey?

49:03.358 --> 49:06.069
Wait. Alexey, grab him.

49:06.861 --> 49:07.820
Let me go.

49:07.987 --> 49:10.323
- What's wrong with you?
- They might still be alive...

49:10.532 --> 49:12.198
Calm down. I'll go check.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.993
Chill out. Take a deep breath.

49:27.674 --> 49:28.633
Andrey...

49:39.477 --> 49:40.687
Andrey.

49:52.907 --> 49:54.490
Come on. Turn him over.

49:54.492 --> 49:55.535
Here we go.

50:18.558 --> 50:19.851
Andrey!

50:35.617 --> 50:36.576
Enough.

50:36.951 --> 50:39.785
Alexey, that's enough.
Do you hear me?

50:39.787 --> 50:41.247
Alexey, he's dead.

50:58.473 --> 50:59.933
Guys, did you hear that?

51:00.141 --> 51:01.100
Over there.

51:06.564 --> 51:07.523
Let's go.

51:24.999 --> 51:26.209
Can you stop?

51:54.862 --> 51:58.282
Andrey, what's wrong with you?

52:04.664 --> 52:05.623
Andrey?

52:22.890 --> 52:23.849
Andrey!

53:26.120 --> 53:27.079
Andrey.

53:45.098 --> 53:46.057
Viktoria?

53:46.391 --> 53:47.350
Viktoria?

53:47.642 --> 53:48.601
Zoya?

53:50.812 --> 53:52.272
- Viktoria?
- Wait.

53:53.064 --> 53:54.023
Viktoria?

54:12.792 --> 54:14.460
Zoya's here.

54:19.507 --> 54:22.093
Zoya, where's Viktoria?
What happened?

56:27.635 --> 56:28.594
Zoya?

57:19.353 --> 57:20.563
This is her husband.

57:22.189 --> 57:23.273
Is she the Widow?

57:32.491 --> 57:33.450
Do you copy?

57:34.827 --> 57:36.078
Hello, do you copy?

57:37.330 --> 57:38.289
Do you copy?

57:43.336 --> 57:44.295
Do you copy?

57:45.171 --> 57:46.756
Ilya, can you hear me?

57:48.549 --> 57:49.675
Zoya's dangerous.

57:50.217 --> 57:51.802
She killed her husband.

57:52.553 --> 57:54.013
Ilya, is she with you?

57:55.723 --> 57:57.475
I'm in her house now.

57:58.684 --> 58:00.477
Ilya, do you copy?

58:01.312 --> 58:02.271
Ilya?

58:19.538 --> 58:20.497
How are you, Zoya?

58:24.210 --> 58:25.878
Was Viktoria with you?

58:27.755 --> 58:28.714
Can you hear me?

58:30.925 --> 58:33.052
Can you tell me what happened?

58:34.345 --> 58:35.721
What did you see?

58:37.431 --> 58:38.390
Zoya?

58:41.727 --> 58:43.687
Do you copy? This is the rescue
team speaking...

58:43.896 --> 58:44.855
It's useless.

58:46.273 --> 58:47.232
She's in shock.

58:47.525 --> 58:48.484
Do you copy?

58:48.943 --> 58:50.027
Can you hear me?

58:51.946 --> 58:53.156
There's no signal.

58:55.616 --> 58:57.034
The signal can't get through.

58:57.618 --> 59:00.830
We have to get out of this
lowland.

59:01.455 --> 59:04.166
All my equipment went down with
the van. Shit.

59:04.458 --> 59:05.709
And all our phones.

59:10.131 --> 59:11.924
We'll have to go back for Andrey.

59:12.550 --> 59:13.509
We will.

59:13.801 --> 59:15.261
I've marked this place on the map.

59:20.307 --> 59:21.767
Alexey, can you pass me the GoPro?

59:21.934 --> 59:22.893
Here you go.

59:25.980 --> 59:27.023
Let's see.

59:31.402 --> 59:33.819
Alexey? Did your GoPro connect?

59:33.821 --> 59:36.782
- Wait. It's showing two cameras.
- That's weird.

59:38.409 --> 59:39.785
Is it Viktoria's GoPro?

59:40.828 --> 59:43.456
- Maybe it was saved in the memory?
- Maybe.

59:44.498 --> 59:46.458
It's working.

59:47.585 --> 59:48.544
Let me see.

59:54.675 --> 59:57.676
- How far does the signal reach?
- I don't know. It can be different.

59:57.678 --> 01:00:00.306
Alexey, you come with me. Kristina,
stay with Zoya.

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.808
Ilya, I'm not staying with her.

01:00:03.017 --> 01:00:05.144
- You're gonna slow us down.
- I said I'm not staying.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:08.105
- I'm not staying with her.
- You will stay. End of story.

01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:09.899
Or I'll tie you up.

01:00:11.192 --> 01:00:12.151
Ilya?

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:15.320
Goddamit.

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.247
- Is it far?
- About 200 metres to the north.

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:27.082
Viktoria!

01:00:30.336 --> 01:00:31.295
Viktoria.

01:00:41.722 --> 01:00:42.681
Viktoria.

01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:55.527
Viktoria.

01:00:56.028 --> 01:00:56.987
Viktoria.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:00:59.281
Viktoria!

01:01:05.371 --> 01:01:06.330
Play with me.

01:01:06.914 --> 01:01:07.873
What the...?

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:10.792
Viktoria.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:16.965
Viktoria?

01:01:20.094 --> 01:01:21.053
Here she is.

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:25.391
Viktoria.

01:01:29.937 --> 01:01:30.896
Alexey, don't go there.

01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:32.898
Viktoria.

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:36.401
Viktoria.

01:01:37.403 --> 01:01:38.571
Give me your hand.

01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:41.031
Your hand, Viktoria.

01:01:42.241 --> 01:01:44.744
Give me your hand.
Your hand.

01:01:46.245 --> 01:01:47.204
Come on.

01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:48.705
Here we go.

01:01:51.792 --> 01:01:52.835
Here we go.

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:54.670
Hold on.

01:01:59.758 --> 01:02:01.218
Come on.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:04.596
We're almost there.

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:06.431
Hold my hand.

01:02:10.436 --> 01:02:11.687
Don't let go of my hand.

01:02:18.152 --> 01:02:19.111
Come on.

01:02:19.612 --> 01:02:20.738
Give me your hand.

01:02:21.989 --> 01:02:22.948
Come on.

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:24.366
Here we go.

01:02:27.995 --> 01:02:30.456
There were newspapers about the lost
people in her house.

01:02:30.831 --> 01:02:31.790
She killed them.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.126
Just like her husband.

01:02:34.835 --> 01:02:36.462
Her photo was also there.

01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:38.297
She's a witch.

01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:43.385
She performs some kind of rituals
there. That bitch.

01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:45.930
She did something to Andrey.

01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:48.598
We have to find him.

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:51.477
- Andrey's dead. We saw his body.
- Stop it, enough.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:55.105
Viktoria, how are you feeling?

01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:57.566
Do you feel dizzy, or nauseated?

01:02:58.651 --> 01:02:59.819
You don't believe me.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:02.779
Okay.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.241
Kristina, Alexey, go find some
sticks.

01:03:07.159 --> 01:03:10.663
- We're gonna have a talk.
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:15.792
Okay. Alexey, let's go.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:18.170
Kristina, you're in charge now.

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:31.475
I believe you. You hear me?

01:03:34.228 --> 01:03:35.813
She's going to kill us all.

01:03:40.192 --> 01:03:43.529
Listen. Do you think you can find
that house again?

01:03:47.366 --> 01:03:51.243
If she's really a witch, and everything
you say is true... it's gonna be huge.

01:03:51.245 --> 01:03:53.706
Viktoria, the whole world will know
about us.

01:03:57.584 --> 01:04:00.212
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.

01:04:07.678 --> 01:04:11.390
Evil spirits hiding in the swamps,
the fog and in dark haze.

01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:14.226
Those who bring death to the crops
and make us tremble with fear.

01:04:14.435 --> 01:04:16.854
Bright red sunrise, come and keep
those evil spirits away.

01:04:26.739 --> 01:04:27.698
What are you doing?

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:32.035
Are you out of your mind?

01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:40.585
Bright red sunrise, come and keep
the evil spirits away.

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:52.097
Bright red sunrise, come and keep
the evil spirits away.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:46.401
Enough.

01:05:55.327 --> 01:05:57.120
What did you do to Andrey?

01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:05.003
She won't let us go...

01:06:06.213 --> 01:06:07.923
the lame Widow.

01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:09.674
Answer me.

01:06:12.845 --> 01:06:16.015
Without human sacrifice...

01:06:17.683 --> 01:06:19.435
she won't let you go.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.646
- Stay where you are.
- You don't understand.

01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:28.527
I can't save more souls anymore.

01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:35.367
Now, it's your turn.

01:06:37.536 --> 01:06:38.996
You should do it alone.

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:40.831
Only you.

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:44.376
The Widow only needs you.

01:06:50.382 --> 01:06:52.217
You have to protect everyone.

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:53.843
This is your burden now.

01:07:12.112 --> 01:07:13.322
What did you do?

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:19.537
She did it... not me.

01:07:20.746 --> 01:07:21.705
What happened?

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:25.750
Who shot?

01:07:28.086 --> 01:07:29.713
What's going on here?

01:07:31.924 --> 01:07:33.298
Are you freaking crazy?
Who shot?

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:36.094
What do you mean? It was her.
She killed her.

01:07:37.471 --> 01:07:38.803
She did it herself.

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:39.764
Shit.

01:07:41.225 --> 01:07:43.475
- Right now, I saw...
- Put the camera away.

01:07:43.477 --> 01:07:45.938
A rescuer just committed murder.

01:07:53.153 --> 01:07:56.448
- The Widow won't let anyone leave.
- How does it feel to kill a human?

01:07:56.657 --> 01:07:58.284
Or maybe even two people?

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.660
Did you kill Andrey, too?

01:08:01.662 --> 01:08:02.661
Hold her.

01:08:02.663 --> 01:08:03.747
You don't understand.

01:08:04.498 --> 01:08:05.916
We're all going to die here.

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:09.294
- We're going to die.
- Calm down.

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:15.968
The Widow won't let us escape.
We're going to die here.

01:08:16.343 --> 01:08:17.301
Viktoria.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:19.263
The Widow won't let us escape.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.182
Calm down.

01:08:24.184 --> 01:08:26.309
- Don't tie me to her.
- Okay, calm down.

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:27.938
I said calm down and sit.

01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:36.154
Alexey, I didn't do it.
Check the camera.

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:38.363
Ilya, what are we going to do?

01:08:38.365 --> 01:08:39.408
Bring it here.

01:08:40.367 --> 01:08:41.326
Thank you.

01:08:43.662 --> 01:08:44.621
Here you go.

01:08:44.997 --> 01:08:46.665
We'll watch it on the tablet.

01:08:58.719 --> 01:08:59.803
Damn.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.514
It won't read the card.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.515
- Wait, what?
- It's not working.

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:06.685
Sorry, Viktoria. The card's not
detectable.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:10.313
Alexey, do you have another USB? Maybe
there's a problem with the tablet?

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:11.648
No, I don't have it.

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:14.192
- Ah, wait.
- Where did you get that phone?

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:16.528
I found it in the hole.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:20.823
Let's try this card.

01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:26.830
Here we go.

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:31.832
- Oh, there's some file here.
- Play it.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:32.917
Hi, everyone.

01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:35.880
Today, we're going to scare Shura.
He's so afraid of evil stuff.

01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:38.884
But he's pretending not to
be afraid.

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:42.179
Hey, why don't we go home?

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:44.055
Wait, do you hear that?

01:09:44.598 --> 01:09:46.015
There was a sound.

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:47.642
Let's go check it out.

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:50.310
- Wait for me, Nikita.
- Are you scared?

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:52.229
Nikita?

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:56.568
We're explorers. We're following
some strange traces.

01:09:57.736 --> 01:10:00.989
Shura will be eaten first, cause
he's the youngest.

01:10:01.448 --> 01:10:04.368
Oh yeah? Mom hardly let you
go alone.

01:10:07.454 --> 01:10:08.747
What the hell?

01:10:09.581 --> 01:10:10.540
Wait here.

01:10:10.957 --> 01:10:12.584
- I see some light.
- What?

01:10:12.793 --> 01:10:13.752
Quiet!

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:17.380
Hide your flashlight.

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:22.427
You'll return to the
dead water.

01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:24.262
And go back to your pit.

01:10:25.472 --> 01:10:28.183
I'm standing before you naked,
just like you were.

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:33.605
Leave me alone. Leave all the living
alone.

01:10:34.314 --> 01:10:37.776
Cover yourself in wheat straws,
you'll be warm.

01:10:39.111 --> 01:10:42.698
- Spare me, lame Widow.
- That's Zoya.

01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:46.910
Don't go after the living...

01:10:47.828 --> 01:10:51.582
Go after my gift. Take this
sacrifice.

01:10:52.624 --> 01:10:54.292
Leave in piece.

01:10:54.668 --> 01:10:57.546
Enter the hay doll, and leave
the living.

01:10:58.088 --> 01:10:59.298
Bright red sunrise...

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:03.134
Run!

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:08.264
- Shura?
- Mom!

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:28.452
Bright red sunrise, come and keep
the evil spirits away.

01:11:29.536 --> 01:11:31.455
She was protecting us.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:33.748
But from who?

01:11:38.712 --> 01:11:40.505
Andrey, what have you got there?

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:43.047
Andrey, we are waiting on
the collection point.

01:11:43.049 --> 01:11:44.175
Can you hear me?

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:47.846
Okay. Let's go find the helping
rescue team.

01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:50.349
Alexey, light the flare.
Hurry.

01:12:41.775 --> 01:12:45.028
We're going around in circles.
This is the same spot.

01:13:08.385 --> 01:13:11.054
Bright red sunrise, come and keep
the evil spirits away.

01:13:11.388 --> 01:13:14.138
Bright red sunrise, come and keep
the evil spirits away.

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:16.766
Bright red sunrise, come and keep
the evil spirits away.

01:13:16.768 --> 01:13:19.477
Bright red sunrise, come and keep
the evil spirits away.

01:13:19.479 --> 01:13:22.732
Bright red sunrise, come and keep
the evil spirits away.

01:14:07.027 --> 01:14:08.153
Come on, stand up.

01:14:09.446 --> 01:14:10.405
Are you okay?

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:14.909
Are you okay?

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:16.327
What?

01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:37.075
What are these stakes for?

01:15:39.244 --> 01:15:41.496
It's a trap. So no one
would leave.

01:15:43.289 --> 01:15:44.373
We're in a pit.

01:15:46.793 --> 01:15:48.837
That's where the Widow was
buried.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:51.295
Do you copy? This is the rescue team
speaking.

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:52.630
- We can't escape.
- Ilya!

01:15:52.632 --> 01:15:54.799
- We can't escape.
- Answer it, Ilya!

01:15:54.801 --> 01:15:56.968
- Answer it. Ilya!
- We can't escape.

01:15:56.970 --> 01:16:00.432
- There's no way out.
- Hello?

01:16:01.766 --> 01:16:03.559
Can you hear us? Do you copy?

01:16:04.102 --> 01:16:05.437
Save us, please.

01:16:05.603 --> 01:16:07.438
Save us! Do you copy?

01:16:19.284 --> 01:16:20.535
We're all going to die.

01:16:22.162 --> 01:16:24.414
We can't escape.

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:28.960
We're all going to die here.

01:16:29.502 --> 01:16:30.795
We have to do something.

01:16:31.004 --> 01:16:32.797
There's no way out.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.469
We can't help him.

01:16:41.848 --> 01:16:45.643
She heard us. She heard.

01:16:46.853 --> 01:16:49.314
She heard us.

01:16:56.154 --> 01:16:57.656
Here.

01:16:59.491 --> 01:17:00.492
Here.

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:08.726
- Viktoria.
- Get up.

01:18:14.774 --> 01:18:15.733
Get up!

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:23.199
Do you hear me? Get up!

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:24.803
Play with me.

01:21:24.464 --> 01:21:25.423
Viktoria...

01:21:32.305 --> 01:21:33.264
Viktoria?

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.169
Evil spirits hiding in the swamps.

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:50.007
Spirits lurking in the fog
and in the dark haze.

01:22:50.341 --> 01:22:53.843
Those who bring death to the crops
and make us tremble with fear.

01:22:53.845 --> 01:22:56.387
Those who bring misfortune and
suffering.

01:22:56.389 --> 01:22:58.349
I'll enter the church from the
other side.

01:22:58.516 --> 01:23:01.016
I won't pray for life...
I'll pray for death.

01:23:01.018 --> 01:23:03.854
I'll pray for the evil to stay
in peace.

01:23:15.648 --> 01:23:20.648
