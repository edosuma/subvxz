01:27.254 --> 01:28.756
- Take care, son!
- Always, Mom.

01:29.924 --> 01:32.092
Baby! Your lunch!

01:34.637 --> 01:37.473
- Thank you.
- You got it. Good morning.

01:37.473 --> 01:39.225
- Good morning!
- Good night.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.437
Dirty woman!

06:25.469 --> 06:26.386
It hasn't changed.

06:27.638 --> 06:28.722
Doggie, say Merry Christmas!

08:19.416 --> 08:20.500
Heck! You don't speak!

08:55.160 --> 08:58.580
Mr. Sanchez, my house is your house.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.792
No, love. My father's house
is definitely his house.

10:16.825 --> 10:19.995
Oh, my God! Good morning, miss!

10:25.876 --> 10:27.419
Dummy, your mommy!

10:27.419 --> 10:29.212
Hey, don't be mean.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.340
- Come in!
- Thank you!

10:37.387 --> 10:39.639
- Very, very well!
- Beautiful.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.562
Who cries when given free bread?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.815
- You brought my favorites!
- Yes, of course!

10:48.815 --> 10:49.775
Yummy!

10:49.775 --> 10:51.526
Would you like a coffee?

10:51.526 --> 10:53.695
I can't stay, I'm sorry.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.369
You are shameless!

11:00.369 --> 11:03.163
- I gotta run. Gabbie, see you soon!
- Okay, son.

11:12.130 --> 11:15.008
Oh, come on!

11:15.008 --> 11:17.135
This smartass!

11:22.307 --> 11:24.351
Jeez , I told this guy to call me

11:25.769 --> 11:28.271
And why don't you call him?

11:45.455 --> 11:46.456
Very well.

11:54.798 --> 11:58.135
What a beautiful surprise!

12:06.601 --> 12:07.686
These losers...

12:58.361 --> 13:00.280
<i>You saw me arriving running</i>

13:00.280 --> 13:02.949
<i>And so maybe I'll go</i>

13:02.949 --> 13:04.910
<i>You should know the stories.</i>

13:49.371 --> 13:51.248
Where they always go, love,
under the tree.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.425
This one is all raggedy and sparse!

14:41.214 --> 14:42.215
Tell me.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.429
Tell me.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.015
Okay, let's see, baby.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.822
Wait a second, Benito!

15:26.384 --> 15:30.013
You are so stubborn! Come here!

15:33.642 --> 15:36.478
Okay! Let's see. Show me your skills.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.271
Now stretch your legs. Jeez! Wait!

15:38.271 --> 15:40.315
- Cramp, cramp!
- You have to warm up!

15:40.315 --> 15:41.900
- Where does it hurt?
- My butt!

15:41.900 --> 15:45.320
- Where?
- No, my butt!

15:45.320 --> 15:48.156
- Here? Where?
- There, there...

17:51.905 --> 17:53.531
You are full of surprises!

17:59.204 --> 18:02.207
How is my baby?!

18:04.626 --> 18:06.294
Wow! My baby so skinny!

18:07.587 --> 18:09.547
Don't worry, we are gonna enjoy

18:09.547 --> 18:11.674
plenty of tacos, chilaquiles
and tortillas.

18:14.552 --> 18:15.678
What's going on?

18:28.733 --> 18:31.194
Hey, how are you, Sr. Sanchez?

18:32.195 --> 18:33.196
What did he say?

18:44.791 --> 18:47.085
- That's it!
- What did he say his name was?

18:47.085 --> 18:48.294
- Leif. Mucho gusto
- What's that mean?

18:52.590 --> 18:55.051
- Welcome, Leif!
- Thank you!

19:17.824 --> 19:18.908
What did he say, did you hear?

19:20.660 --> 19:21.536
Darn it!

19:58.281 --> 20:00.408
We didn't know anything!
You kept the secret very well!

20:16.758 --> 20:18.843
Benicio, please stop!

20:20.970 --> 20:23.514
Bring it down a notch! He's listening!

20:44.160 --> 20:46.162
He is like a cannellini bean,
among the black beans.

20:52.085 --> 20:55.004
Jeez! What a temper!

21:34.877 --> 21:36.838
Yes, I know! What an ugly name!

21:38.548 --> 21:39.924
Have a seat. What? It's true!

21:41.592 --> 21:43.761
He's so sweet.

21:43.761 --> 21:46.180
- He looks like a good guy! Right?
- Yes, I know.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.533
What about a Mexican candy?

23:32.286 --> 23:33.287
Oh, my God!

23:48.928 --> 23:52.098
Wow, what happened to you?!

23:52.098 --> 23:54.100
How did you get tangled up like this?

23:54.100 --> 23:56.227
Don't be a jerk. Don't film this.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.146
- Talk to the camera, sis!
- Stop, Carmen.

23:58.146 --> 24:00.189
Heal, heal, little frog's tail!

24:07.196 --> 24:08.906
Maybe the smell helps you.

24:11.325 --> 24:13.161
Damn! Son of a gun!

24:15.621 --> 24:17.707
What happened?! Are you okay?!

24:17.707 --> 24:19.250
It's nothing, baby.

24:20.251 --> 24:21.752
- How can I help you, Mom?
- It's nothing, baby.

24:21.752 --> 24:24.213
Calm down, everyone! I'm fine!

24:25.214 --> 24:26.382
Hey, just...

25:00.583 --> 25:02.376
Is it because he's white?

25:24.357 --> 25:25.900
Hey, Dad! What's going on?

25:26.901 --> 25:27.777
Stop.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.327
Yes! Whatever his name is.

26:18.327 --> 26:19.662
He is a good boy.

26:22.290 --> 26:23.791
Look, look!

26:26.669 --> 26:31.007
With these guys from NY!
The chiro... practicians.

26:33.467 --> 26:35.177
Well, I didn't know.

26:40.141 --> 26:41.267
- What?
- What do you think?

26:41.267 --> 26:42.351
What is that?

26:44.603 --> 26:45.563
A cactus?

26:46.647 --> 26:48.107
Benicio, really?

26:53.195 --> 26:54.572
They are there on Christmas Eve,

27:14.050 --> 27:16.177
Okay. It is pretty.

27:17.511 --> 27:19.930
No! It's pretty!
Look at the little bow! So pretty.

27:26.187 --> 27:27.980
Yes, that one.

28:17.780 --> 28:18.906
Hey, what's up, dude?

28:58.654 --> 28:59.738
Damn lights!

29:37.860 --> 29:39.111
What the hell is this?

32:12.514 --> 32:13.474
What?

32:54.723 --> 32:55.724
- What?
- Let's go.

32:57.768 --> 32:58.769
Dad, my heels!

33:41.979 --> 33:43.021
Where's he?

34:07.004 --> 34:08.213
Party pooper.

34:47.127 --> 34:48.754
The wetback!

35:16.490 --> 35:17.825
What the hell is it with this chicken?

35:26.458 --> 35:27.584
Why, what now?

35:57.948 --> 35:59.741
Have you lost your mind?!

36:11.420 --> 36:12.838
That's going too far.

36:13.130 --> 36:14.006
Look...!

36:14.965 --> 36:16.008
Look!

36:16.008 --> 36:17.092
You stupid chicken!

36:21.096 --> 36:23.432
He's like a duck without legs!

38:42.279 --> 38:44.239
Dance with me!

38:50.620 --> 38:52.873
Damn chicken!

38:53.874 --> 38:56.126
Tita! At least pluck the chicken!

39:15.562 --> 39:17.022
Thank you!

39:18.857 --> 39:21.193
Are you gonna close the door?

40:00.315 --> 40:01.608
Bye, beautiful.

40:01.608 --> 40:03.735
- Drive safe, okay?
- Always, love.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.363
Sounds good, big kiss.
See you later!

40:56.246 --> 40:57.497
Honey.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.914
A little bit of hips.

42:53.196 --> 42:55.115
<i>Squeeze your glutes.</i>

42:55.115 --> 42:57.033
<i>Smile.</i>

42:58.076 --> 42:59.160
Damn!

43:59.554 --> 44:01.181
Stupid chicken.

45:30.979 --> 45:32.856
Die, die!

45:57.630 --> 45:59.340
- Of course, Dad!
- Yes, brother-in-law!

46:50.934 --> 46:52.185
Ignore him.

47:46.739 --> 47:48.283
Hey! Behave!

49:14.118 --> 49:16.079
- Keep going!
- Get him, Javier!

49:18.581 --> 49:19.999
Oh, damn! That's it!

49:22.043 --> 49:23.795
What the hell!

49:25.254 --> 49:26.964
Long live Mexicans!

49:33.304 --> 49:36.182
You are all dead!

49:36.182 --> 49:37.892
To your graves, dumbasses!

54:58.879 --> 55:00.840
Of course! I know they are fantastic!

55:01.841 --> 55:04.635
Give me one, please.

55:04.635 --> 55:07.304
Carmen, please bring me
some spoons and some forks.

55:08.889 --> 55:12.184
Do you want a "tamale hug"?

55:12.184 --> 55:14.103
- What?!
- A "tamale hug"?

55:14.103 --> 55:16.856
- What is that?
- A hug with meat inside!

55:18.649 --> 55:20.401
- Girls!
- Carmen!

55:20.401 --> 55:23.195
That old bird, he is up to something.

55:27.658 --> 55:28.993
Something.

55:28.993 --> 55:31.829
What bird?

58:31.926 --> 58:33.844
Did he get a concussion
from the ball or what?

58:38.140 --> 58:39.475
Oh, my love.

58:43.270 --> 58:46.398
Oh, my God! You look faint.

58:46.398 --> 58:48.984
Are you pregnant? Let's see...

58:59.703 --> 59:01.413
Wow, look at you!

59:01.413 --> 59:03.082
Well, that's it.

59:11.507 --> 59:15.928
You completely messed up this time,
Benicio! Completely!

59:42.830 --> 59:44.331
Why are they leaving?

59:46.625 --> 59:47.835
Where are you going?

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:59.109
Even if he was green like an alien.

01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:54.182
What do you mean, he's gay?

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:57.621
And you know what?

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:27.706
I mean, not on purpose.

01:09:40.427 --> 01:09:42.470
because we are a family,
that's what we do,

01:09:53.607 --> 01:09:54.649
Including Leaf...

01:10:10.624 --> 01:10:12.918
Okay, then let's go!

01:10:21.301 --> 01:10:22.886
Come on, let's go! Drive!

01:10:24.429 --> 01:10:25.430
What?

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:27.223
- I don't have the keys!
- You had them!

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:29.434
- Damn it!
- I don't have them! You always--

01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:30.936
Baby, you always do the same!

01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:34.731
Yes, there they are!

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:36.316
Oh, my God!

01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:08.807
Holy crap!

01:12:04.446 --> 01:12:05.780
Come on, let's go!

01:12:24.215 --> 01:12:26.134
Carmela, no. Wait.

01:12:26.134 --> 01:12:28.470
Please, sir. It is very important.

01:12:32.474 --> 01:12:34.309
The family's future is in danger.

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:44.319
Seriously, these gringos
are so inflexible.

01:12:44.319 --> 01:12:48.364
Please, ma'am! Show some respect.
I'm just trying to do my job.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:53.453
I was talking about the other gringos.
It's all good.

01:12:53.453 --> 01:12:56.206
- Let's go.
- Wow, you are handsome!

01:13:02.087 --> 01:13:04.255
- Hey, where are you going?!
- Brother-in-law!

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:18.556
Look at him.

01:15:42.372 --> 01:15:43.831
Did I leave the tag on?

01:16:11.109 --> 01:16:13.569
Maybe they have their babies.

01:16:15.947 --> 01:16:16.823
Well...

01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:19.784
Okay, wait a second.

01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:23.288
- Maybe later?
- Yes, maybe later.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:07.850
Take a picture!
