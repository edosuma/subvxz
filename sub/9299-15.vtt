00:09.736 --> 00:12.271
<i>Okay, so we got two
with the quinoa base,</i>

00:12.305 --> 00:13.706
<i>basil, cheddar, topped
with a poached egg</i>

00:13.740 --> 00:14.840
<i>and slathered with secret sauce, right?</i>

00:14.875 --> 00:16.675
<i>- Yes.
- Okay. Coming right up.</i>

00:22.582 --> 00:24.550
<i>People love your food, Holden.</i>

00:24.584 --> 00:27.853
Can't keep your secret
sauce in stock, man.

00:27.888 --> 00:30.756
It's your secret sauce. I'm happy
to put your photo on the label.

00:30.790 --> 00:33.058
Ah, it wouldn't sell without
your pretty face, dude.

00:33.093 --> 00:35.694
Hey, one thing you should think
about, though, is another truck.

00:35.729 --> 00:39.398
I'd rather stay small.
Keep it 100% clean, organic food.

00:39.466 --> 00:42.301
You know my motto ...
"hell no to GMO."

00:42.335 --> 00:44.303
We should head back to
the restaurant, chef.

00:44.337 --> 00:46.872
Can you swing by later so we
can balance the truck's account?

00:46.907 --> 00:49.041
Yeah, you got it.

00:49.075 --> 00:50.376
You okay?

00:51.811 --> 00:53.779
Yeah, um, I don't feel
that well this morning.

00:53.813 --> 00:55.981
Oh, your stomach still jumping?

00:56.016 --> 00:59.852
- Uh, it's feeling worse, actually.
- Oh, well, let me take you home.

01:01.087 --> 01:02.922
Chef, are you all right?

01:02.956 --> 01:04.723
Holden, what is it?

01:05.692 --> 01:09.495
- Reed, call 911!
- Stay back! Holden?

01:14.601 --> 01:17.736
- Starting the day off tired?
- No.

01:17.771 --> 01:19.405
You're yawning 'cause
you skipped breakfast.

01:19.439 --> 01:20.673
<i>You didn't eat breakfast?</i>

01:23.810 --> 01:26.111
No, I'm yawning because you're boring.

01:26.146 --> 01:29.615
You know, studies show that
yawning actually increases boredom.

01:29.649 --> 01:33.254
Hey! I got the best news!
I passed!

01:34.071 --> 01:36.987
You passed the plumbers'
apprenticeship exam.

01:37.026 --> 01:39.861
I didn't know you're studying to
be a plumber. Tommy, that's great.

01:39.895 --> 01:41.529
Well, I only passed by one point.

01:41.563 --> 01:43.898
Yeah, but Massachusetts
has very rigorous standards.

01:43.932 --> 01:45.366
That's a difficult exam.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.869
- I'm so proud of you.
- Yeah, good job, bro.

01:47.903 --> 01:50.037
All I got to do now is 550
hours of plumbing theory,

01:50.072 --> 01:51.739
1,700 hours of work credits,

01:51.773 --> 01:53.875
<i>take the exam to be
a journeyman plumber.</i>

01:53.909 --> 01:56.677
52 weeks after that,
I'll be a master plumber.

01:56.712 --> 01:59.614
You can't legally fix my
toilet for three years?

01:59.648 --> 02:02.350
- Yeah, technically.
- Hey, Frankie, you want to bring back

02:02.384 --> 02:03.918
Rizzoli and sons plumbing with me?

02:03.952 --> 02:08.122
Uh... thanks, bro, but
I like the detective work.

02:08.157 --> 02:11.626
All right, go ahead.
Tell them your other good news.

02:11.660 --> 02:14.648
And, you, I'm gonna fix some eggs.

02:15.531 --> 02:17.064
I'm gonna ask Lydia to marry me.

02:17.099 --> 02:20.735
Oh, Tommy! That's great!

02:20.769 --> 02:23.171
Oh, that's gonna be so nice for T.J.

02:23.205 --> 02:25.139
- Yeah.
- Right, Frankie?

02:26.575 --> 02:29.710
Uh-huh.
Ow!

02:29.745 --> 02:33.181
- So nice for T.J.
- Yeah. Who's that?

02:34.483 --> 02:36.117
Excuse me.

02:36.151 --> 02:38.019
So tell us how you're gonna propose.

02:38.086 --> 02:40.521
Excuse me.

02:41.690 --> 02:43.658
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Frankie.

02:43.692 --> 02:46.027
- Gosh, I haven't seen you in forever.
- Yeah.

02:46.061 --> 02:48.462
Uh, this is my brother, Tommy.

02:48.530 --> 02:50.064
Tommy, officer Charlie Hanson.

02:50.098 --> 02:52.200
- Hi. Charlie. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

02:52.234 --> 02:56.804
I think Tommy has inherited
my father's wandering eye.

02:56.838 --> 02:58.439
That doesn't bode well for marriage.

02:58.473 --> 03:00.675
<i>It'd be nice if Frankie found someone.</i>

03:00.709 --> 03:02.076
Although doesn't she
seem a little young?

03:02.110 --> 03:04.645
Maybe the Rizzolis aren't
cut out for marriage.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.148
I mean, my engagement ring is still
sitting in a safety-deposit box.

03:07.182 --> 03:09.584
Well, you shouldn't wait too long
to make a decision about Casey.

03:09.618 --> 03:11.652
it's not healthy, Jane.

03:12.721 --> 03:16.157
I would love to sit here and process,
but duty calls.

03:23.865 --> 03:27.702
I remember when Copley Square
was just a couple of hotels.

03:27.736 --> 03:29.570
Now it's food truck central.

03:29.638 --> 03:31.706
Oh, my goodness!
Is that Chef Holden?!

03:31.740 --> 03:33.174
<i>Who's Chef Holden?</i>

03:33.208 --> 03:35.543
He's last season's
"America's Best Chef" winner.

03:35.577 --> 03:38.496
- The reality show?
- He made the most inventive

03:38.497 --> 03:41.082
deconstructed pheasant Normandy
from hearts of palm.

03:42.551 --> 03:44.151
- What happened to him?
- It's not clear.

03:44.186 --> 03:46.721
Those two were with him
when he suddenly collapsed.

03:46.755 --> 03:48.756
Is that Reed Bennet and Dalia Reilly?

03:48.790 --> 03:49.957
Yeah. How'd you know that?

03:49.992 --> 03:52.860
- Well, I saw every episode.
- Me, too.

03:52.894 --> 03:55.229
What did you think of Chef Holden's
sous-vide duck?

03:55.264 --> 03:58.032
Oh, that technique was controversial.

03:58.066 --> 04:00.201
You know, I-I've made
the grilled watermelon

04:00.235 --> 04:01.936
with the charred beef and fennel.

04:02.004 --> 04:03.871
You're making me hungry.

04:03.905 --> 04:06.974
Can you two foodies
stop salivating, please?

04:07.009 --> 04:08.609
What did the paramedics say?

04:08.644 --> 04:09.944
He was in full cardiac
arrest when they got here.

04:09.978 --> 04:11.746
<i>Couldn't resuscitate him.</i>

04:11.780 --> 04:13.214
What a shame.

04:13.248 --> 04:15.650
You know, his name, Holden,
actually means "kind."

04:15.717 --> 04:18.753
He donated to every food-activist group.

04:18.820 --> 04:22.156
He put his money where his palate was.
He only served organic food.

04:22.190 --> 04:25.159
He was perspiring heavily.

04:25.227 --> 04:27.695
Posterior nose bleed.

04:35.304 --> 04:37.905
Maura, are you smelling him?

04:38.939 --> 04:40.675
Get everyone back!

04:40.742 --> 04:43.844
- Maura, your nose is bleeding.
- No, Jane, get back!

04:43.879 --> 04:45.813
Call the hazmat team now!

04:45.881 --> 04:46.981
<i>Folks, move back!</i>

04:49.184 --> 04:51.352
<i>I need hazmat and
critical-incident-response team</i>

04:51.386 --> 04:53.654
<i>at Copley plaza now.</i>

05:23.251 --> 05:27.588
<i>My EKG is normal.
I'm fine. Thank you.</i>

05:27.622 --> 05:29.790
Maura, I really think you
should go to the hospital.

05:29.825 --> 05:31.625
It's not necessary.

05:31.660 --> 05:33.694
Really, everybody that ate in
the food truck didn't get sick.

05:33.762 --> 05:35.663
Even the paramedics that
were treating him are fine.

05:35.697 --> 05:37.832
You touched him with gloves.
Why did your nose bleed?

05:37.866 --> 05:39.333
You know, I likely became symptomatic

05:39.368 --> 05:41.302
because I inhaled the
toxin that was on his skin.

05:41.336 --> 05:44.004
- Do you know what it is?
- No.

05:44.039 --> 05:47.041
No. Mnh-mnh.
I am not stripping down

05:47.109 --> 05:48.609
and getting sprayed with the fire hose.

05:48.643 --> 05:49.844
We brought a shower.

05:49.878 --> 05:52.880
<i>Oh, so we can strip and shower there?</i>

05:52.948 --> 05:54.248
We'll put up a screen.

05:55.350 --> 05:57.952
<i>Take off your clothes and shoes now.</i>

05:57.986 --> 05:59.720
Put them in these biohazard bags.

05:59.755 --> 06:03.290
- Oh, man. This is a new suit.
- These are my favorite shoes.

06:04.860 --> 06:06.093
Do you know what killed him?

06:06.128 --> 06:07.762
No, we haven't identified the toxin yet.

06:07.796 --> 06:10.197
- I'll do the autopsy.
- No, Maura, you can't.

06:10.232 --> 06:12.566
I'll wear a full hazmat suit.

06:12.601 --> 06:15.002
As soon as the body is sealed and
safe to be moved, we'll transport it.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.838
Please transport the food and
the equipment from the truck, too.

06:17.873 --> 06:20.376
I'll let my staff know to
prepare for a biohazard.

06:28.150 --> 06:31.385
Are Jane and Maura okay?

06:31.420 --> 06:34.188
- Yeah, they're fine.
- Whew!

06:34.256 --> 06:36.157
- Do you want some coffee?
- Please.

06:36.191 --> 06:38.125
The girls are changing in the car.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.794
They didn't want to get caught
dead in a paper jumpsuit.

06:39.828 --> 06:43.964
- I kind of like it. It's comfortable.
- Oh, no, no.

06:43.999 --> 06:46.033
We're gonna drink this coffee
and then go change in the gym.

06:46.067 --> 06:48.636
Maybe botulism killed Chef Holden.

06:48.703 --> 06:51.906
I don't think so. Dr. Isles said
it had a distinct chemical smell,

06:51.940 --> 06:53.374
like maybe a cleaning product.

06:53.442 --> 06:54.975
So maybe it wasn't a murder.

06:55.010 --> 06:57.178
We have to investigate
all suspicious deaths,

06:57.212 --> 06:59.413
and I'm betting dollars to doughnuts
it'll turn out to be a homicide.

06:59.481 --> 07:01.415
I watched all his episodes.

07:01.483 --> 07:05.820
Why would anybody want to
murder that really cute TV chef?

07:09.257 --> 07:11.392
Wow. Congrats.

07:11.426 --> 07:13.093
Third kid. I can't even imagine.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.429
You ought to try it, detective.
Babies are the best.

07:15.464 --> 07:17.932
- Mm. Hey, Maura.
- Hey, Frankie.

07:17.966 --> 07:19.967
Dr. Isles, these were
just delivered for you.

07:20.001 --> 07:23.871
For me? Oh.
I wonder what it is.

07:23.905 --> 07:27.208
The return address is
a P.O. Box in Cypress.

07:27.275 --> 07:28.980
Did you order something
from Cypress?

07:29.094 --> 07:32.880
No. Well, the customs
tag says "collectibles."

07:32.948 --> 07:36.158
I'm not a collector, unless shoes count.

07:40.422 --> 07:41.822
That didn't sound good.

07:41.890 --> 07:46.043
Uh, Frankie, does a suspicious
mail alert say anything about

07:46.044 --> 07:50.197
excessive postage or having a
return address as a P.O. Box?

07:50.232 --> 07:53.901
<i>Yeah, it says don't handle
and activate your emergency plan.</i>

07:53.969 --> 07:55.970
It doesn't say anything about a
clicking noise if you pick it up.

07:56.004 --> 07:57.872
I think it's a pressure switch.

07:57.906 --> 07:59.874
- Oh, god.
- Okay, you should get out of the building.

07:59.908 --> 08:02.176
You, too, officer Jenkins.
Send the bomb squad in.

08:02.210 --> 08:04.178
- No.
- Initiate the evacuation procedure.

08:04.212 --> 08:06.847
- I'm gonna put my hands over yours, okay?
- Notify the bomb squad.

08:06.882 --> 08:08.227
- I'm gonna help you maintain pressure.
- There's suspicious packages at the front desk.

08:08.262 --> 08:11.062
Thank you, Frankie.

08:11.097 --> 08:14.188
- What's going on?
- You need to clear the building.

08:14.256 --> 08:16.490
It's possible the package we're
holding is an explosive device.

08:16.525 --> 08:18.325
Go outside and block
the entrance, Frost.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.194
Wait, if there was a bomb,
wouldn't it have gone off

08:20.262 --> 08:22.229
- when it was handled by the post office?
- No, not necessarily.

08:22.297 --> 08:24.298
If the sender knows that
it's reached its destination,

08:24.332 --> 08:25.833
it could be remotely activated.

08:25.867 --> 08:27.729
Did anyone call about these packages?

08:27.764 --> 08:29.703
Yeah, a few minutes ago to check
to make sure they made it here.

08:29.771 --> 08:31.972
I think I might have
engaged the pressure switch.

08:32.006 --> 08:33.908
So, what happens if you let go?

08:33.975 --> 08:35.275
It's like a land mine.
You step on it ...

08:35.309 --> 08:37.077
when you lift your foot, it goes off.

08:37.111 --> 08:38.379
- Will you go, Frost?!
- You should go too, sergeant.

08:38.413 --> 08:41.931
I'm waiting for the bomb squad.
Jenkins, you have a new baby. Get.

08:42.317 --> 08:44.179
- Korsak ...
- Would you get out?!

08:44.215 --> 08:47.955
- That's an order! Go!
- Frost, get my Mom out, too, will you?

08:49.457 --> 08:51.725
It's gonna be okay.

09:06.513 --> 09:09.915
<i>Bomb tech is in position.
All entrances are sealed off. </i>

09:09.949 --> 09:11.984
I can't believe there's
only one bomb tech in there.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.552
- I just can't stand here.
- Come on, Jane.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.587
I-I will tackle you to the
ground if you take another step.

09:15.622 --> 09:18.457
It's not a simple disposal, Jane.
They can't use a robot, either.

09:18.491 --> 09:21.560
I know, but it's Frankie
and Maura in there.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.132
That's a reassuring sound.

09:27.200 --> 09:31.103
- It means no radiation so far.
- Okay. I like that.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.440
My arms are sore!

09:35.642 --> 09:37.276
Distract me.

09:37.310 --> 09:40.245
Uh... tell me about your case.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.514
That reality-chef-show
guy really got poisoned?

09:42.582 --> 09:45.351
We don't yet have a cause of death.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.553
Wh-what happens if you guess?

09:47.587 --> 09:51.023
Well, I guess it's a little
like if you were to wear a dress.

09:51.057 --> 09:53.425
Okay, I get it.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.961
But there is something
that's bothering me.

09:55.995 --> 09:58.881
- You mean other than this?
- Why didn't the chef,

09:58.882 --> 10:01.934
who has a refined palate
and superior olfactory skills,

10:01.968 --> 10:04.370
smell the toxin that
was covering his skin?

10:04.404 --> 10:06.972
- Maybe he had a cold.
- I don't think so.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.213
What's wrong?

10:14.247 --> 10:16.281
Come on, Jane.
Stop watching that.

10:16.316 --> 10:19.118
- I-I-I can't.
- Jane, give it to me.

10:19.152 --> 10:23.622
What the hell?
What are they doing?

10:23.690 --> 10:26.458
Are they saying goodbye?

10:26.893 --> 10:29.027
<i>So itchy.</i>

10:29.062 --> 10:31.063
- Yeah? You got it?
- Mm-hmm.

10:31.097 --> 10:32.569
So if I go like this, you got it?
That's good?

10:32.566 --> 10:35.244
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

10:36.439 --> 10:38.237
<i>Finally. Thank you, Frankie.</i>

10:38.304 --> 10:40.539
It's a good thing my
beard grows in fast.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.040
Mm-hmm.

10:42.075 --> 10:46.645
- I didn't... scratch your skin, did I?
- No. I'm fine.

10:50.784 --> 10:54.086
The level of radiation we're being
exposed to isn't a health risk.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.622
The level of radiation from an X-ray is
the last thing I'm worried about right now.

11:02.128 --> 11:04.997
I really loved working on
the café racer with you.

11:06.374 --> 11:10.536
Me, too.
Me, too. I really ...

11:10.570 --> 11:13.138
I really enjoyed repairing
the throttle valve.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.575
Okay.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.478
- I'm gonna look, okay?
- Yeah.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.048
What is it?

11:23.116 --> 11:26.452
Cylinders,
stacks of metal containers,

11:26.486 --> 11:29.621
a circuit board. What ...
there's some wiring.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.459
"Kappa Alpha."

11:36.262 --> 11:39.598
- Oh, no.
- What? What is it?

11:39.632 --> 11:44.503
If the Greek letters under these
stamps say "Phi Iota Sigma,"

11:44.537 --> 11:46.605
- I think I know what's in the package.
- You do?

11:46.673 --> 11:48.807
Kaphis.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.776
<i>Coffee. I ordered it.</i>

11:50.810 --> 11:54.213
- You ordered it from Cypress?
- No. Amazon.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.615
They sent me an e-mail
months ago from Missouri.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.418
They said they were on back order
looking for a new supplier. I forgot.

11:59.486 --> 12:03.021
Maybe ... maybe they fulfilled my order
with a ... company in Cypress.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.557
But that looks like a circuit
board, and that's a wire.

12:05.592 --> 12:10.562
I ordered a coffee maker, too.
It's probably the click that we heard.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.030
The on-off switch.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.399
This is not an explosive device.

12:21.307 --> 12:25.611
- How much coffee did you buy?
- Oh, my god.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.346
A lot.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.348
You guys can let go now.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.117
- Oh.
- Okay.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.519
Oh, my gosh, I can't move my hands.

12:33.553 --> 12:34.820
- Okay.
- Ohh.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.556
<i>Okay. There. Okay.</i>

12:37.590 --> 12:42.261
- I'm so sorry for the trouble.
- Hey. It's okay.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.531
This is gonna be
something I never forget.

12:45.565 --> 12:48.133
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.136
Okay.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.771
- Oh, my god.
- Ohh.

12:52.839 --> 12:54.740
Come here.
Come here. All right.

12:59.512 --> 13:03.148
<i>Holden Hathaway is a
well-nourished 32-year-old male.</i>

13:03.182 --> 13:06.385
His blood work showed he was suffering

13:06.419 --> 13:08.820
<i>from hypoxemia with hypercapnia.</i>

13:08.855 --> 13:11.690
<i>And that confirms what I'm seeing
in his otherwise healthy heart.</i>

13:11.724 --> 13:16.295
Yes, I noticed something strange
about his otherwise healthy heart, too.

13:16.329 --> 13:20.299
<i>Cause of death ... cardiac arrest
brought on by respiratory failure.</i>

13:20.333 --> 13:23.402
Did he know he was nose-to-nose
with such a dangerous toxin,

13:23.436 --> 13:28.206
and it might have a disastrous
outcome to all who knew him?

13:28.241 --> 13:31.810
<i>He was helping me with an
uncomfortable sensation.</i>

13:33.346 --> 13:35.881
- We're on speaker, Maura.
- It's all right.

13:35.915 --> 13:39.301
If you're talking about coffee-pot gate
and your brother playing twister

13:39.302 --> 13:41.920
with the medical examiner,
everybody knows.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.689
<i>I had pruritus.</i>

13:43.723 --> 13:45.324
Yes, that's ... that's Dr. Isles' way

13:45.358 --> 13:46.858
- of saying she had an itch.
- Mm.

13:46.893 --> 13:49.695
<i>Yes, pruritus, given the
situation that I was in,</i>

13:49.729 --> 13:51.530
<i>could only be relieved with scratching.</i>

13:51.564 --> 13:54.733
Toxins, Dr. Isles.
Let's ... let's talk toxins.

13:54.767 --> 13:57.502
<i>Well, based on the
patterning of acute urticaria,</i>

13:57.570 --> 14:00.405
<i>cyanosis, cardiac arrest,
and the odor that I detected,</i>

14:00.473 --> 14:03.609
<i>I had Susie run tests for
organophosphates on his skin.</i>

14:05.411 --> 14:07.479
I think I have it.
It's dichlorovos.

14:07.513 --> 14:10.415
- What's dichlorovos?
- Uh, it's a common organophosphate.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.385
<i>It's used in insecticides.
It's a neurotoxin.</i>

14:13.453 --> 14:17.422
<i>- Like bug spray?
- Well, I can't confirm it was a spray.</i>

14:17.490 --> 14:20.592
<i>But I can confirm that
that's what killed him.</i>

14:20.627 --> 14:23.562
<i>Uh, do you have the results
from the GSMs on his clothing?</i>

14:23.596 --> 14:26.465
<i>Uh, yes, he's got traces on
his pants and his shoes.</i>

14:26.499 --> 14:28.567
<i>But the chef's coat he had
on was just saturated with it.</i>

14:28.635 --> 14:30.702
The hazmat team is still
processing the truck.

14:30.737 --> 14:34.840
- I'll have everything field-tested.
- Okay, and I'll have CSRU check for it

14:34.874 --> 14:36.675
in Chef Holden's
restaurant, car, and home.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.714
What are you doing down here?

14:42.749 --> 14:46.351
I didn't realize you'd been
promoted... to my lieutenant.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.453
You can't go in there.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.390
What? It's hazmat protocol.

14:54.827 --> 14:58.864
I, uh... need you to track down
Chef Holden's chef coats.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.400
- Sure.
- It was really brave of you

15:01.401 --> 15:03.669
to stay with Maura
and hold that package.

15:03.736 --> 15:09.274
- It was coffee pods.
- Yeah, but you didn't know that.

15:12.295 --> 15:17.382
Frankie, is it possible that
a high-stress situation has...

15:17.450 --> 15:22.988
- intensified a... crush?
- No.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.959
You might as well know.
I've liked her for a long time.

15:28.027 --> 15:30.495
You know she's practically family.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.597
- And you work together.
- So?

15:32.632 --> 15:36.902
So you shouldn't mess around
with people you work with.

15:48.970 --> 15:52.205
It's pretty ironic that somebody
dosed Chef Holden with insecticide.

15:52.239 --> 15:53.640
How ironic?

15:53.674 --> 15:56.142
Well, he was all about
organic foods, you know?

15:56.176 --> 15:59.112
No insecticides, no GMOs
in anything he served.

15:59.146 --> 16:00.546
What's a GMO?

16:00.581 --> 16:02.715
Wh-what you're about
to put in your mouth ...

16:02.750 --> 16:05.685
<i>genetically modified organisms.</i>

16:05.719 --> 16:08.655
Hey, do you think a cookie made
with this GMO stuff is safe to eat?

16:08.689 --> 16:11.958
Mm, it's unclear.
The European union banned GMOs,

16:11.992 --> 16:13.960
and there haven't been any
long-term safety studies.

16:15.429 --> 16:19.432
Maura, can you trace the insecticide
on his chef's coat by brand?

16:19.466 --> 16:22.702
No, dichlorovos has the same chemical
structure in every insecticide.

16:22.736 --> 16:25.305
I've been digging into
Chef Holden's life.

16:25.339 --> 16:27.273
Did you locate any family members?

16:27.308 --> 16:29.108
Yeah, his parents live in Hong Kong.
No girlfriend or wife.

16:29.143 --> 16:31.077
What about these two chefs
that were with him when he died?

16:31.111 --> 16:34.047
They met on "America's Best Chef."
I've been watching clips.

16:34.081 --> 16:37.684
Yeah, it was an extraordinary season,
particularly the finale.

16:39.753 --> 16:42.288
<i>Dalia, tell us about your finale dish.</i>

16:42.323 --> 16:46.459
<i>I made a seared sweet bay scallop
with a horseradish beurre blanc.</i>

16:46.493 --> 16:50.063
- Way to ruin perfectly good seafood.
- Grilled kale and fig...

16:50.097 --> 16:51.597
<i>Reed, what about your dish?</i>

16:51.632 --> 16:54.000
<i>Well, I love comfort
food, so here's my twist.</i>

16:54.034 --> 16:56.669
<i>Fricassee of sweetbreads
and oyster mushrooms</i>

16:56.704 --> 16:58.304
<i>with mashed sunchokes.</i>

16:58.339 --> 16:59.806
Nothing comforting about
fricasseed sweetbreads

16:59.840 --> 17:01.574
- and sunchokes, if you ask me.
- Mh-hm.

17:01.608 --> 17:03.543
<i>I've made a deconstructed
pheasant normandy</i>

17:03.610 --> 17:06.212
<i>with onions, apples,
peppercorn, apple brandy...</i>

17:06.246 --> 17:08.414
What an astounding imagination.

17:08.449 --> 17:10.616
<i>This was a tough one for us.</i>

17:10.651 --> 17:13.051
Not for me. I'd send them all home
and order a pizza.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.521
<i>Dalia, you are
America's third-best chef.</i>

17:15.556 --> 17:20.526
<i>We all love your witty saporific take
on French nouvelle cuisine.</i>

17:20.594 --> 17:22.627
- No wonder you like this show.
- Congratulations.

17:22.663 --> 17:27.599
- No one says "awesome."
- Reed, you are America's second-best chef.

17:27.634 --> 17:34.007
<i>That means that you, Chef Holden,
are America's Best Chef.</i>

17:34.041 --> 17:37.134
So, they lose to Holden, but
they end up working for him?

17:37.169 --> 17:39.479
Uh, Chef Holden won $150,000
to start his restaurant.

17:39.513 --> 17:42.248
- He brought Dalia to help.
- Chef Holden's farm to table.

17:42.282 --> 17:44.450
It's impossible to
even get a reservation.

17:44.485 --> 17:47.921
"The organic french farm-style
menu is rife with amusing,

17:47.922 --> 17:51.357
inventive dishes like a playful
take on a mint and coconut soup."

17:51.392 --> 17:54.293
- Maura.
- Oh, I would love to eat there.

17:54.328 --> 17:56.062
All right, what about reed?
What's his story?

17:56.096 --> 17:57.363
The runner-up, Reed, didn't get famous.

17:57.398 --> 18:00.700
He went back to his old job at a hotel.
Holden hired him to run a food truck.

18:00.734 --> 18:02.668
Any indication Dalia or Reed
weren't getting along with Holden?

18:02.703 --> 18:05.371
Oh, yeah.
Dalia and Holden were a couple.

18:05.406 --> 18:07.407
Chefs are the new renaissance men.

18:07.441 --> 18:10.676
They broke up when he got famous.
Dalia posted this.

18:10.711 --> 18:15.481
"End-of-romance rage makes me want
to put a cockroach in his food."

18:15.516 --> 18:17.350
Maybe she decided
Holden was the cockroach.

18:17.384 --> 18:20.297
And it was time to exterminate him.

18:24.691 --> 18:26.692
<i>Yeah, we broke up,
but we stayed friends.</i>

18:26.760 --> 18:28.227
<i>We had a business to run.</i>

18:28.262 --> 18:29.762
We're gonna need to take his computer.

18:29.797 --> 18:31.564
It's got all the records for
the restaurant and the truck.

18:31.598 --> 18:34.500
We'll get it back to you.
Did you have any employees

18:34.535 --> 18:36.502
who might have had an
issue with their boss?

18:36.537 --> 18:39.205
No way.
You couldn't not like the guy.

18:39.239 --> 18:41.607
I lost to him, but he
still became my best friend.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.777
<i>He was super-cool
and super-generous.</i>

18:44.812 --> 18:46.679
He had a moral compass
like I've never seen.

18:48.348 --> 18:49.715
We all wanted to be like him.

18:49.783 --> 18:51.851
Even when he was offered
millions for his company,

18:51.885 --> 18:54.253
he wouldn't sell out ...
I mean, who does that?

18:54.288 --> 18:55.555
Were there any companies
that didn't like

18:55.589 --> 18:57.190
hearing the word "no" for an answer?

18:57.224 --> 19:00.226
Only one I can think of
is Copley Square Foods.

19:00.260 --> 19:02.295
They kept trying to
schedule a meeting with him.

19:02.329 --> 19:04.130
Copley Square Foods. They're ...

19:04.164 --> 19:06.599
they're the biggest contributor
to the anti-GMO labeling lobby.

19:06.633 --> 19:09.202
Chef Holden was an anti-GMO activist.

19:09.236 --> 19:12.171
He got us all on board
with environmental issues.

19:12.206 --> 19:16.742
He even spent his own money
to lease us all green cars.

19:16.777 --> 19:20.146
Even got me to use environmentally
friendly wax on my car.

19:20.180 --> 19:23.549
- Where did he keep his chef's coat?
- Which one?

19:24.818 --> 19:27.520
- How many does he have?
- Dozens.

19:27.554 --> 19:29.689
Changed three or four times a night.

19:29.723 --> 19:32.091
Couldn't cook unless he had on a
clean coat. It was his lucky charm.

19:32.126 --> 19:35.595
He had them everywhere...
home, car, truck, here.

19:35.629 --> 19:38.698
Okay, could you show us
the ones you have here?

19:39.833 --> 19:41.100
Excuse me.

19:42.870 --> 19:44.170
Hey, Maura.

19:44.204 --> 19:45.638
<i>Jane, I found something odd.</i>

19:45.672 --> 19:47.573
I couldn't understand why Chef Holden

19:47.608 --> 19:49.675
couldn't detect the
odor of the dichlorovos,

19:49.743 --> 19:53.312
but I'm looking at medical records
from an E.R. visit six months ago.

19:53.347 --> 19:56.382
His olfactory nerve was
severed in a car accident.

19:56.416 --> 19:59.752
Isn't that connected to
his ability to taste?

19:59.820 --> 20:01.721
Yes. So how could he
get a five-star review

20:01.755 --> 20:04.737
after he lost his ability to taste?

20:05.225 --> 20:10.502
I don't think he did.
I think someone tasted for him.

20:16.670 --> 20:20.339
Detective Rizzoli,
can I talk to you for a minute?

20:20.374 --> 20:23.743
- Hey, Hope, what are you doing here?
- It's about Maura.

20:23.777 --> 20:26.512
What, do you need another body part?

20:28.415 --> 20:30.750
She returned a gift.

20:30.784 --> 20:34.849
It's... my necklace, and
it was meant for her.

20:34.955 --> 20:38.791
You didn't give that to her.
Your real daughter, Cailin, did.

20:38.825 --> 20:40.459
That's not fair.

20:40.494 --> 20:42.929
You're the last person
to talk to me about fair.

20:42.963 --> 20:45.965
Hope, you only show up when you
want something, so spit it out.

20:45.999 --> 20:50.870
- What do you want this time?
- Her forgiveness.

20:50.904 --> 20:53.773
You just don't get it, do you?

20:53.807 --> 20:55.908
You made it very clear that
it was pretty inconvenient

20:55.909 --> 20:58.010
for you to find out that
Maura was still alive.

20:58.045 --> 21:00.012
- That's not true.
- It's not?

21:00.047 --> 21:04.817
You told her she wasn't yours
and then accused her of scamming you.

21:04.885 --> 21:08.354
Well, I was ...
It was shocking.

21:08.388 --> 21:11.444
So was showing up again
and asking her for a kidney.

21:11.925 --> 21:15.326
Be happy she has the decency
to talk to you at all.

21:16.296 --> 21:18.331
So many things I know I've done wrong.

21:18.398 --> 21:22.235
Yes. Like standing by your
man and treating his wounds

21:22.269 --> 21:25.037
after he murdered Lieutenant
Cavanaugh's wife and baby.

21:25.072 --> 21:27.773
I told the grand jury everything.

21:27.808 --> 21:31.711
I will be a key witness in
the trial, and I will be the

21:31.712 --> 21:35.615
reason that Paddy is put to
death if he's found guilty.

21:35.649 --> 21:37.516
Hope, for all we know, you made a deal.

21:37.584 --> 21:39.318
I did not make a deal.

21:39.353 --> 21:41.420
Then why hasn't the I.R.S.
closed down your M.E.N.D.

21:41.455 --> 21:42.922
clinics and frozen all your assets?

21:42.956 --> 21:46.592
I turned over all the books.
The I.R.S. knows where to find me.

21:46.627 --> 21:49.562
Yeah, well, so does Maura.

21:49.596 --> 21:54.066
- I need her forgiveness.
- Here's the pain you can't undo.

21:54.101 --> 21:56.836
Paddy is a gangster, and you're a liar.

21:56.870 --> 21:59.939
It's not really the happy
ending she was hoping for.

22:00.815 --> 22:04.505
<i>Excuse me. I have a
suspect to interview.</i>

22:13.511 --> 22:16.245
No one could know
that he wasn't the chef

22:16.279 --> 22:19.215
behind the restaurant,
behind Chef Holden foods.

22:19.249 --> 22:21.951
He was the name.
Holden was the brand.

22:21.985 --> 22:26.889
And you, a classically trained chef,
had to become his tasting beard.

22:26.923 --> 22:28.858
I guess, if you want to put it that way.

22:28.892 --> 22:31.127
- Well, it had to have been tough.
- It wasn't ideal.

22:31.161 --> 22:32.928
You were driving the car

22:32.963 --> 22:35.498
that injured his olfactory
nerve, weren't you?

22:35.532 --> 22:38.968
And you stayed and you cooked and
you helped build his restaurant

22:39.002 --> 22:41.036
because you felt
responsible for his injury.

22:41.104 --> 22:43.572
I was responsible.

22:43.607 --> 22:46.408
Was the crash deliberate?

22:46.443 --> 22:49.979
You called it an
"end-of-romance rage."

22:50.046 --> 22:52.848
You sent that out right
before the crash, didn't you?

22:52.883 --> 22:54.350
Look, I was angry.

22:54.384 --> 22:56.452
He broke up with me and then
asked me for a ride home.

22:56.486 --> 22:59.054
He said it wasn't
working out as a couple

22:59.089 --> 23:01.090
because of the restaurant.

23:01.124 --> 23:03.850
When he didn't die in the car
crash, did you try to poison him?

23:05.128 --> 23:07.229
No.

23:07.264 --> 23:11.567
That's not what happened.
Poison?

23:11.635 --> 23:12.968
<i>I loved him.</i>

23:13.003 --> 23:17.006
I chose to stay behind
and help him with the restaurant.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.240
After he dumped you.

23:22.212 --> 23:26.849
I had to make peace just being near him.

23:26.883 --> 23:29.385
It had to be enough.

23:31.454 --> 23:32.670
We got to let Dalia go.

23:32.755 --> 23:35.324
We don't have anything to tie her
to the poison that killed Holden.

23:35.392 --> 23:37.626
I got 10 coats from the dry cleaners.

23:37.661 --> 23:41.096
"Naturally Clean & Bright."

23:41.131 --> 23:43.532
Just because they say they're
eco-friendly doesn't mean they are.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.367
- Any trace of insecticides?
- No.

23:45.402 --> 23:47.002
Did you check the cleaners?

23:47.070 --> 23:48.604
CSRU went through the whole place.

23:48.638 --> 23:52.641
They use natural insecticides ...
onions, garlic, and cloves.

23:52.676 --> 23:54.143
How many other chef's
coats did you recover?

23:54.211 --> 23:56.579
10 clean, 7 dirty ones in his house,

23:56.613 --> 23:58.280
3 clean in his car, 4 in the truck.

23:58.315 --> 24:01.383
And 5 from the restaurant. The crime
lab's still processing them all.

24:01.418 --> 24:03.252
So far, nothing in his
restaurant, home, or car

24:03.286 --> 24:04.853
showed any trace of dichlorovos.

24:04.888 --> 24:07.240
Hazmat incident commander
didn't find any sign of

24:07.241 --> 24:09.592
insecticides in the food truck,
so they released that, too.

24:09.626 --> 24:11.994
So the only thing
contaminated was a chef's coat

24:12.028 --> 24:13.596
that only Holden would wear.

24:18.068 --> 24:19.468
What are you doing?

24:19.502 --> 24:21.870
I was thinking about
Chef Holden's inability

24:21.905 --> 24:24.073
to smell the organophosphate
on his chef coat.

24:24.107 --> 24:26.108
It's a subtle smell, but I can smell it.

24:26.142 --> 24:28.567
You could smell a fart
in New Hampshire, Maura.

24:29.179 --> 24:31.247
Look at these two bottles
of his secret sauce.

24:31.314 --> 24:33.315
- That one's darker.
- Yes.

24:33.350 --> 24:36.885
- Now... taste them.
- Taste them?

24:36.920 --> 24:39.421
No, we're in the crime lab.
It's not very appetizing.

24:39.456 --> 24:41.924
- Maur...
- Just just taste it.

24:47.197 --> 24:49.265
- It's good.
- Mm-hmm.

24:49.299 --> 24:52.034
Now try this one.

24:55.338 --> 24:58.374
- Tastes the same.
- If you're not a super-taster, it does.

24:58.408 --> 25:00.109
I think I've just been insulted.

25:00.177 --> 25:02.445
Well, I did some DNA sequencing.

25:02.479 --> 25:04.680
And do you know what
the secret ingredient is

25:04.748 --> 25:07.349
- in Chef Holden's secret sauce?
- Ketchup.

25:07.384 --> 25:11.821
Saffron.
This sauce is $49 a bottle.

25:11.888 --> 25:15.458
- Wh... for hot sauce?!
- Well, it's $5,000 a pound for saffron.

25:15.525 --> 25:17.226
Come ... that's not possible.

25:17.260 --> 25:20.229
It takes up to 500 flowers
to make one gram of saffron,

25:20.297 --> 25:22.398
which could explain ...

25:22.432 --> 25:24.900
which could explain
why he started to use

25:24.935 --> 25:28.204
genetically modified saffron,
which is only $10 a pound.

25:28.238 --> 25:29.972
But he was against using GMOs.

25:31.341 --> 25:34.543
Okay. Let's get something
to eat. I'm starving.

25:34.578 --> 25:36.629
- What are you...?
- What? You're always telling me to eat

25:36.698 --> 25:39.992
more greens. This will disguise the
taste of brussels sprouts. Come on.

25:47.390 --> 25:49.358
I liked this place better
when they covered everything

25:49.392 --> 25:53.262
- in salt and grease.
- I think I like Maura.

25:55.465 --> 25:57.867
- You can't like Maura.
- Why not?

25:57.934 --> 25:59.835
Because it's Maura, that's why.

25:59.870 --> 26:01.971
- You did.
- Yeah, I mean...

26:02.005 --> 26:03.839
she's hot and smart
and has got a great ass,

26:03.874 --> 26:05.875
but, Frankie, she's like our sister.

26:05.909 --> 26:07.877
She didn't feel like my sister
when I had my hands on her.

26:07.911 --> 26:12.148
- Dude, just stop. You can't.
- Why not?

26:12.215 --> 26:15.384
- Promise you won't hit me?
- Depends on what you say next.

26:15.418 --> 26:18.420
You and Maura ... you don't match.

26:20.323 --> 26:21.390
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

26:21.424 --> 26:25.361
- Hey.
- Hey. I was just headed out.

26:25.395 --> 26:26.328
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:26.363 --> 26:29.598
What is the update
on the rest of Holden's chef coats?

26:29.633 --> 26:33.469
Uh, the crime lab said they had no
trace of insecticides on any of them.

26:33.503 --> 26:36.038
- Hey, Frankie.
- Hey, Charlie!

26:36.072 --> 26:38.807
- I owe you a beer.
- You do? Okay.

26:38.875 --> 26:40.376
- Cool. Come on.
- All right.

26:40.410 --> 26:41.443
Good night.

26:41.478 --> 26:42.912
- Frankie.
- Yeah?

26:42.946 --> 26:48.458
- Thanks for holding my hands today.
- Anytime.

26:57.661 --> 26:59.195
<i>Two? Okay.</i>

26:59.229 --> 27:01.430
I'm sure glad I checked
out that cop's ass.

27:01.464 --> 27:02.932
Excuse me?

27:02.966 --> 27:05.801
It made me realize I want
to get married... to Lydia.

27:05.835 --> 27:08.037
<i>Oh, well, that's very sweet, Tommy.</i>

27:08.071 --> 27:12.508
You know what? Check it out.
I got her a ring!

27:12.542 --> 27:16.378
Ooh! It's an amethyst!
That's a lovely color.

27:16.413 --> 27:18.380
That's really pretty, Tommy.

27:18.415 --> 27:22.885
Lydia likes purple.
I'm gonna go show Ma.

27:22.953 --> 27:24.420
She'll be thrilled.

27:24.454 --> 27:26.055
- See you.
- Bye.

27:28.892 --> 27:30.326
What's wrong?

27:30.360 --> 27:33.095
I don't like how I'm feeling.
It lacks integrity.

27:33.163 --> 27:34.530
Okay, I'm lost.

27:36.333 --> 27:39.268
Tommy's just so excited to go
share his news with your mom.

27:39.302 --> 27:42.338
I just ... I feel a little jealous.

27:42.372 --> 27:44.607
I always wanted that kind of
a relationship with my Mother.

27:44.641 --> 27:49.278
Oh. I mean, Constance
isn't warm and fuzzy,

27:49.312 --> 27:50.913
but she loves you, Maura.

27:50.947 --> 27:55.284
I always knew I was adopted.
When I was young and I felt lonely,

27:55.318 --> 27:59.421
I would tell myself, "someday
my real Mother will appear."

27:59.489 --> 28:02.591
- Hope came to see me today.
- What?! Why didn't you tell me?

28:02.626 --> 28:06.128
Okay. All right, why?
Why did she come and see you?

28:06.162 --> 28:07.896
I think she wants to make amends.

28:07.931 --> 28:10.532
Well, she doesn't need to.
I'm over it.

28:10.567 --> 28:13.869
<i>You're not over it,
and you shouldn't be.</i>

28:13.937 --> 28:16.205
Yes, I should.
And so should she.

28:16.239 --> 28:21.010
Maura, Hope knows how I feel about her,

28:21.077 --> 28:23.545
and she swallowed her pride
and she came to see me anyway.

28:23.613 --> 28:26.949
So what more does she want?
I talk to her when she calls.

28:26.983 --> 28:29.451
Yeah, you talk to her
the same way that you talk

28:29.452 --> 28:31.920
to that neighbor that
over-waters your roses.

28:31.955 --> 28:34.223
Which are on my property ...
and I was very polite to him

28:34.257 --> 28:36.992
when I told him to fix his sprinklers.

28:38.695 --> 28:41.363
All right, so, you know, why ...

28:41.398 --> 28:42.998
why would you be Hope's advocate?

28:43.033 --> 28:47.069
- I'm your advocate.
- Now I'm lost.

28:47.103 --> 28:49.271
Well, admit it.
It bums you out, doesn't it?

28:51.508 --> 28:54.376
Maura, nobody's gonna judge you
if you change your mind about her.

29:16.624 --> 29:19.659
- Hey.
- Frankie.

29:21.929 --> 29:25.899
Um, would you like to try the coffee?

29:25.933 --> 29:26.966
Sure.

29:31.705 --> 29:35.842
- I feel a little ridiculous.
- Why? You shouldn't.

29:35.876 --> 29:38.511
Everything about that
box was suspicious.

29:38.546 --> 29:43.283
- It could easily have been a bomb.
- Yeah. But it wasn't.

29:43.317 --> 29:49.455
You know, sometimes we think
that something is more than it is.

29:55.930 --> 29:58.832
Yeah.

29:58.866 --> 30:02.502
I-I don't really have time for coffee.
Thanks, though.

30:02.536 --> 30:04.804
Just wanted to make sure you're okay.

30:07.942 --> 30:10.310
I'll see you around.

30:15.583 --> 30:19.118
Oh. Why would Holden
pay off a gang banger?

30:19.153 --> 30:20.687
What do you mean?

30:20.721 --> 30:22.789
Um, Shabazz Jones ...
I recognize his name.

30:22.823 --> 30:24.924
He's with the Huntington Avenue raiders.

30:24.959 --> 30:26.960
Look, you see that,
under "truck security"?

30:26.994 --> 30:29.095
600 bucks a week's going to Shabazz.

30:29.129 --> 30:30.930
He's on parole for assault and battery.

30:30.965 --> 30:33.366
- Who'd he go after?
- A food-truck owner.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.768
Shabazz was shaking
down Holden's food truck.

30:35.803 --> 30:37.704
Maybe Holden got tired of paying.

30:39.740 --> 30:42.308
How many times I got to tell
you this ain't your spot!

30:42.343 --> 30:44.544
<i>You can't park here!
Get the hell out of here.</i>

30:44.612 --> 30:47.380
Hey, Shabazz?
You can't touch people, man.

30:47.415 --> 30:50.784
Hey, be cool, little mama.
I know every food truck around here.

30:50.851 --> 30:52.552
I can get you free food for a lifetime.

30:52.586 --> 30:55.989
That's all right.
I brought my money. Thank you.

30:56.023 --> 30:58.625
That should cover for the food he stole.

30:58.693 --> 31:00.794
- Give me that.
- That's my order.

31:00.828 --> 31:01.795
No, you just ordered one assault

31:01.796 --> 31:04.230
and battery and two robberies.
Let's go.

31:06.367 --> 31:07.901
You were threatening
the owner of that truck.

31:07.935 --> 31:09.502
You told him he couldn't park there

31:09.537 --> 31:10.603
because he wouldn't
pay you ... that right?

31:10.638 --> 31:13.907
- I don't like his pulled pork.
- I do. What about you, Frost?

31:13.941 --> 31:16.142
- Delicious.
- Mmm.

31:16.177 --> 31:19.846
Now, I see here...
you like to beat up food-truck owners.

31:19.914 --> 31:21.815
Says you were arrested
for hitting the owner

31:21.849 --> 31:25.318
of Chubby Chocolate Treats
with a tire iron.

31:25.386 --> 31:26.953
Yeah, we got in a scuffle.
So what?

31:27.021 --> 31:28.855
So you trade in your tire
iron for some bug spray?

31:28.889 --> 31:31.224
Some what? What the hell
is she talking about, man?

31:31.258 --> 31:33.259
Chef Holden. He got
tired of paying your rent?

31:33.294 --> 31:37.564
- That was my only steady gig.
- Pretty dumb to kill him, then.

31:37.631 --> 31:39.699
Why would I kill him?
I was on his payroll.

31:39.734 --> 31:41.534
Yeah, we know that. What do
you think you're doing here?

31:41.569 --> 31:43.336
Look, I wasn't shaking him down,
if that's what you're thinking.

31:43.370 --> 31:48.241
I provided a service on the payroll.
You can talk to my man Reed.

31:48.275 --> 31:50.677
Reed Bennet? The guy who
ran Chef Holden's truck?

31:50.711 --> 31:52.345
That's the one.

31:52.379 --> 31:54.247
- Now, why would he pay you?
- 'Cause they needed me.

31:54.281 --> 31:56.382
I held that space for
that truck every day.

31:56.450 --> 31:57.851
600 bucks to do that.

31:57.918 --> 32:00.353
Yeah, that... and keep my homies

32:00.387 --> 32:02.856
away from that truck
during prime business hours.

32:02.890 --> 32:04.724
Suits don't like gangsters.

32:04.759 --> 32:07.293
Wait, wait, wait, what ...
what prime business hours?

32:07.328 --> 32:08.895
When the suits got hungry.

32:08.929 --> 32:10.964
Reed said they was trying
to hook a whale or something.

32:10.998 --> 32:14.234
- What does that mean?
- The hell if I know.

32:14.268 --> 32:15.869
Book him for assault and battery.

32:15.903 --> 32:17.771
Come on.
You don't want to do that.

32:17.838 --> 32:21.674
- Yeah, I do.
- Wow. This is crazy.

32:25.713 --> 32:28.314
<i>Shabazz said that Reed paid him</i>

32:28.349 --> 32:31.584
to make sure the suits had
access to the food truck.

32:31.619 --> 32:33.920
The ... the food suits, maybe?

32:33.954 --> 32:37.323
Well, Reed parked it right in
front of Copley Square foods.

32:37.391 --> 32:40.794
- That place is full of food suits.
- And Dalia said that they kept trying

32:40.861 --> 32:43.997
to schedule a meeting with Holden.
Hey, what's up?

32:44.031 --> 32:48.659
Oh, it can wait. I just ... I
just found this sauce in my bag.

32:54.842 --> 32:57.577
Hey, research on olympic
medalists is curious.

32:57.611 --> 32:59.946
Who would you guess is the least
happy ... gold, silver, or bronze?

32:59.980 --> 33:01.520
Bronze. You finish third.

33:01.531 --> 33:03.716
No, they're actually the
happiest because they medaled.

33:03.751 --> 33:06.352
The least-satisfied are
those who finish second.

33:06.387 --> 33:07.987
Korsak, can you play back the finale

33:08.022 --> 33:11.391
- of "America's Best Chef"?
- Yeah.

33:11.425 --> 33:16.696
<i>Reed, you are
America's second-best chef.</i>

33:16.730 --> 33:20.767
<i>But we all love your secret
sauce. Congratulations.</i>

33:20.801 --> 33:25.038
It's the secret sauce.
Chef Holden was opposed to GMOs.

33:25.105 --> 33:26.806
There's no way that
he would have allowed

33:26.841 --> 33:28.441
genetically modified saffron in it.

33:28.475 --> 33:30.443
But his olfactory nerve was severed,

33:30.477 --> 33:32.712
- so he couldn't taste the difference.
- Yeah.

33:32.780 --> 33:35.448
Is Reed Bennet's employment
contract on Holden's computer?

33:35.516 --> 33:39.786
I think Reed wanted to sell his
secret-sauce recipe to Copley foods,

33:39.820 --> 33:41.654
but there's no way that
Holden would've agreed to that.

33:41.689 --> 33:43.623
Because a mass manufacturer

33:43.657 --> 33:45.491
would most certainly
use a cheap GMO saffron.

33:45.526 --> 33:48.428
The only way Reed was gonna get rich
was to get rid of Chef Holden.

33:48.495 --> 33:52.365
And Chef Holden inadvertently
gave him the keys. Listen to this.

33:52.399 --> 33:55.335
"In the event of my death,
I leave the food truck and secret sauce

33:55.369 --> 33:57.904
to Reed Bennet to
manage as he sees fit."

33:59.139 --> 34:01.474
I'm not sure if this helps,

34:01.508 --> 34:03.743
but Susie just found something
else on the chef's coat ...

34:03.777 --> 34:08.781
- environmentally friendly car wax.
- Yeah, that helps.

34:22.402 --> 34:25.570
- Hey, chef.
- Hello.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.205
Do you have something
on Chef Holden's death?

34:27.239 --> 34:28.873
Yeah!

34:28.908 --> 34:30.509
We'll have a lot more once
we've looked at your car.

34:30.543 --> 34:33.311
Why would you look at my car? I ...

34:33.379 --> 34:34.746
<i>Chef Holden's face was everywhere,</i>

34:34.781 --> 34:37.282
and you were stuck slinging
quinoa on a food truck.

34:37.315 --> 34:38.717
It was smart of you to
turn the suits at Copley

34:38.751 --> 34:41.652
on to your secret sauce.
Were you going in to sign a contract?

34:41.687 --> 34:44.356
What contract?
I'm here out of courtesy.

34:44.389 --> 34:46.925
You heard Dalia say they
wanted to meet Chef Holden.

34:46.958 --> 34:48.860
Yeah, you made a lot of courtesy visits.

34:48.928 --> 34:52.831
Visitors parking log recorded you
six times this last six months.

34:53.933 --> 34:57.369
- Is this the sauce with the GMO saffron?
- There's no GMO in our stuff.

34:57.403 --> 34:59.004
That's not what Dr. Isles found.

34:59.038 --> 35:01.640
The DNA profile was conclusive
with the bottle I tested.

35:01.707 --> 35:03.608
It contained genetically
modified saffron.

35:03.643 --> 35:06.845
You saved a pile of money, Reed,
paying $10 an ounce instead of $5,000.

35:06.879 --> 35:10.215
You almost had a deal,
if you could just deliver Chef Holden.

35:10.249 --> 35:11.883
That wasn't gonna happen.
He wouldn't sell out.

35:11.951 --> 35:13.618
"Hell no to GMO."

35:13.653 --> 35:15.520
- Ah.
- Oh, stand back.

35:15.588 --> 35:17.322
I wouldn't want you to inhale bug spray.

35:24.564 --> 35:27.732
<i>It's positive for dichlorovos.
And it's quite a dark red,</i>

35:27.767 --> 35:30.302
which means it still has a
heavy presence of insecticides.

35:30.336 --> 35:32.804
Did you lay it over the hood
and spray it right here, Reed?

35:34.874 --> 35:36.508
He couldn't even taste anymore.

35:36.542 --> 35:39.778
I let him sample the stuff
with the GMO saffron in it.

35:39.812 --> 35:43.281
- He said it was great.
- Is that when you decided to kill him?

35:43.316 --> 35:44.583
Hell of an opportunity.

35:44.650 --> 35:47.319
Test your product,
get the suits on board,

35:47.353 --> 35:49.588
then kill the man, keep the brand.

35:49.622 --> 35:53.658
Dalia and I were the real chefs.
And he got all the credit.

35:53.693 --> 35:57.562
He was the celebrity chef,
pretty face, and his noble cause.

35:57.630 --> 35:58.964
<i>I was the runner-up!
I should have won!</i>

35:58.998 --> 36:00.932
If I had, none of this
would have happened!

36:00.967 --> 36:04.160
You think about that when you're
working at a prison kitchen.

36:12.745 --> 36:14.513
<i> What's remarkable about saffron</i>

36:14.547 --> 36:16.848
is everyone's palate
experiences it differently.

36:16.883 --> 36:19.618
I wonder what's gonna happen
to Chef Holden's foods now.

36:19.652 --> 36:23.455
<i>- Dalia's just gonna keep it going, yeah?
- Well, that makes me feel better.</i>

36:23.489 --> 36:25.357
Mmm! Hi, girls!

36:25.424 --> 36:28.093
- Hey, Ma.
- Try these cakes.

36:28.160 --> 36:31.463
Wedding cakes?
Did Lydia say yes?

36:31.497 --> 36:34.065
No, he didn't ask her yet.
I'm just getting a head start.

36:35.668 --> 36:39.371
Mmm.
Tart with a crisp, acidic, adult finish.

36:39.405 --> 36:41.540
Maura.

36:42.675 --> 36:44.609
- Can you get that?
- Yeah. Sure.

36:44.644 --> 36:48.880
- Oh, is that strawberry?
- Bubble gum. Tommy's favorite.

36:48.915 --> 36:49.948
Oh.

37:00.993 --> 37:02.994
May I come in?

37:04.163 --> 37:05.997
Of course you can.

37:09.135 --> 37:13.071
- Is everything all right?
- No, it isn't.

37:13.139 --> 37:19.110
Hey, Ma, why don't we go pick out
the font for the invitations?

37:19.178 --> 37:21.046
Well, I haven't picked
out the card stock yet.

37:21.080 --> 37:23.448
Okay, we'll fluff pillows.
Come on.

37:23.482 --> 37:25.050
Please don't go.

37:26.752 --> 37:30.555
I made a decision today.

37:30.990 --> 37:36.194
- I am closing my clinics.
- Why would you close M.E.N.D.?

37:36.228 --> 37:39.864
Because I want you to
know how sorry I am.

37:39.899 --> 37:44.869
- And I want to make restitution somehow.
- Wait, wait, closing clinics

37:44.904 --> 37:47.739
that are saving desperate
mothers and ... and children?

37:47.773 --> 37:49.574
<i>I-I don't ... I don't want that.</i>

37:49.609 --> 37:51.509
That's not gonna make up for anything.

37:51.544 --> 37:57.616
I need your forgiveness and for
you to accept me, flaws and all.

37:58.852 --> 38:01.259
I can't.

38:01.854 --> 38:05.890
Please.
You are my daughter.

38:06.835 --> 38:11.062
- I'm not your daughter.
- Maura.

38:11.097 --> 38:16.201
Whether you like it or not,
you're both related.

38:16.235 --> 38:19.904
I've changed.

38:19.939 --> 38:23.408
I wouldn't make the
same decisions today.

38:23.442 --> 38:26.011
So please give me... a chance.

38:32.084 --> 38:34.486
You know, you never
answered my question.

38:37.520 --> 38:40.122
Does this bum you out?

38:41.694 --> 38:44.763
- Yes.
- Okay.

38:45.889 --> 38:48.199
I mean it, Maura.
No judgment.

38:52.571 --> 38:56.574
Please, can we just start over?

39:00.679 --> 39:06.684
People change.
Life changes us.

39:09.254 --> 39:14.325
There is... research proving
the elasticity of the brain.

39:19.982 --> 39:22.283
You want to start over?

39:24.203 --> 39:26.704
Very much.

39:28.440 --> 39:32.410
- Go outside.
- Outside your house?

39:34.046 --> 39:37.148
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I like this plan.

39:39.631 --> 39:43.097
- Okay, what's going on?
- Would you...

39:54.533 --> 39:56.400
You can knock now.

40:19.108 --> 40:22.310
Hello.
I'm Maura Isles.

40:22.378 --> 40:24.278
I'm your... biological daughter.

40:24.313 --> 40:28.923
Hello. I'm Hope Martin.

40:29.618 --> 40:31.949
I'm your mother.

40:33.255 --> 40:35.289
And I have always wanted to know you.

40:39.269 --> 40:43.423
- Oh, this is so touching.
- Ma...

40:45.000 --> 40:49.670
- Would you like some tea?
- Yes.

40:49.705 --> 40:53.374
From the Ya'an, Sichuan province?

40:53.409 --> 40:56.611
Yes!
No one I know likes that tea!

40:57.980 --> 41:02.650
- 'Cause it's panda-poop tea.
- Yes. It is.

41:02.684 --> 41:06.320
Okay, um, I'm gonna go
get some frozen yogurt.

41:06.322 --> 41:07.899
What do you want?

41:07.933 --> 41:10.368
Chocolate with a vanilla swirl.

41:10.402 --> 41:13.070
Oh, uh, I'll have what Angela's having.

41:14.206 --> 41:17.175
And I'll have the same.
But can they not swirl?

41:17.242 --> 41:20.611
Mm-hmm.
Can they at least touch?

41:20.646 --> 41:22.580
I guess.

41:31.056 --> 41:33.420
That's real progress, Maura.
