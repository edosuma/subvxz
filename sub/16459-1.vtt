03:21.951 --> 03:23.702
I'm covering, go.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.149
Are you all right?

03:54.317 --> 03:55.734
Forget him. Clear the room!

04:03.117 --> 04:04.243
Clear.

04:06.537 --> 04:07.704
Let's go.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.169
It's empty.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.684
Colonel Travis,
we've secured the building.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.394
But...

04:30.561 --> 04:33.313
Collins took one, sir. He's dead.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.465
Clear to land. Two-Tango-Sierra.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.551
Okay, so we're clear to land.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.052
What else?

05:04.470 --> 05:08.140
Eight-knot crosswind from the right.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.393
Good. Are you lined up?

05:11.561 --> 05:14.396
There's the interstate.

05:14.564 --> 05:18.525
Runway 2-6. And I got 2-6-0 on the D.G.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.444
Undercarriage.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.404
Coming out.

05:22.572 --> 05:23.613
Good.

05:23.781 --> 05:26.074
It's down and locked.

05:26.909 --> 05:27.909
Anything else?

05:28.703 --> 05:31.121
I don't know. What am I forgetting?

05:31.581 --> 05:32.664
Nothing.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.209
Just relax and fly the airplane.

06:01.069 --> 06:04.237
Very nice touchdown, David.
Very smooth.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.989
You've got this wired.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.116
I don't know about that.

06:09.118 --> 06:12.621
Stop here a second.
You are more than ready.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.499
It's time to cut the umbilical cord.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.793
- You sure about this?
- Come on.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.628
I wouldn't let you go if I wasn't.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.881
Quick, or I'll change my mind.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.678
Keep it simple. Stick and rudder.

06:28.846 --> 06:31.807
- Relax and fly the plane.
- Fly the plane. Got it.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.521
Take it easy.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.026
God, why am I doing this?

06:52.662 --> 06:54.079
David.

06:54.997 --> 06:57.666
David. Phone.

06:58.835 --> 06:59.960
It's happened!

07:47.133 --> 07:48.717
According to informed sources...

07:48.968 --> 07:52.554
El-Sayed Jaffa, perhaps
the most feared terrorist in the world...

07:52.722 --> 07:54.681
was abducted yesterday...

07:55.224 --> 07:58.351
while secretly attending
his daughter's wedding.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.770
He was handed over...

08:00.980 --> 08:04.566
arrested, and taken to a warship
in the Mediterranean.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.319
Wire service intel reports.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.906
None of the causalities answer
our description of Hassan.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.824
No indication he was even there.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.451
He was there.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.995
You called this one right.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.290
Half the Middle East is backing Cyprus,
if only in principle.

08:23.211 --> 08:26.338
We wanted him and now we got him.

08:26.506 --> 08:31.051
Violation of territorial sovereignty,
has lodged a protest with the U. N...

08:31.219 --> 08:33.720
And all the baggage that goes with him.

08:34.304 --> 08:38.390
Until this is resolved,
Jaffa will remain in U.S. Custody...

08:38.601 --> 08:42.729
an inglorious end to 15 years
of world terrorism.

08:59.705 --> 09:03.625
Oceanic Flight 343,
Athens to Washington...

09:03.793 --> 09:05.669
now boarding at gate 13.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.295
Thank you.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.590
Hi. Hi.

09:10.758 --> 09:11.800
- Hi.
- Welcome aboard.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.095
Hi.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.264
- Third seat on the right.
- Thank you.

09:17.431 --> 09:18.765
Thanks.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.184
Is that who I think it is?

09:21.435 --> 09:22.811
In the flesh.

09:23.854 --> 09:27.691
Roger, Athens, cleared as filed.
2-8-0 after takeoff.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.657
Would you like some champagne?

09:39.829 --> 09:41.496
Here, let me help you.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.123
There you go.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.128
Stupid woman.

09:48.337 --> 09:49.421
I'm sorry.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.465
I didn't do it on purpose.

09:54.677 --> 09:58.888
Have a pleasant flight.
Thank you for choosing Oceanic.

09:59.348 --> 10:02.058
Flight attendants,
signal for departure.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.394
Cabin crew, doors to automatic.

10:04.770 --> 10:05.979
Here we go.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.162
Excuse me, sir. May I help you?

10:22.330 --> 10:23.580
- Wait.
- Sir?

10:24.040 --> 10:26.640
Excuse me, sir.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.299
May I help you?

10:41.807 --> 10:44.684
- Listen to the sound of Al Tha'r!
- Jesus.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.160
This is your captain.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.995
You may remove your seat belts.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.456
Feel free to move about the cabin.

11:06.749 --> 11:10.085
However, when you're seated,
do what we do:

11:10.461 --> 11:12.337
Leave your seats belt on.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.715
I see you've got the usual load.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.092
Who is it this time?

11:17.301 --> 11:20.178
It's my brother's twins.
It's their birthday next week.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.388
Hi.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.308
Have a pleasant flight. Thank you.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.946
- And...
- Me?

11:38.364 --> 11:40.156
Go on. Open it.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.120
Oh, Jeannie.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.331
It's for the ring.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.716
I'm going in the pit. See you.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.968
- All right.
- Thanks.

13:23.552 --> 13:24.552
What was that?

13:30.226 --> 13:31.643
Maintain your course.

13:34.063 --> 13:36.439
Reduce your airspeed as indicated.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.857
Careful.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.067
I am a pilot.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.159
American Embassy.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.161
You've witnessed Al Tha'r's conviction.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.081
I have a message for the President.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.999
I'm in control of flight 343.

13:58.796 --> 13:59.921
Sit down!

14:06.762 --> 14:09.097
Sit down! Sit! Sit!

14:09.265 --> 14:10.932
Sit down! Nobody moves!

14:11.141 --> 14:12.976
- Nobody!
- All right.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.229
Quiet! Quiet!

14:16.438 --> 14:18.356
Sit down!

14:30.202 --> 14:31.244
Get up!

14:31.954 --> 14:32.954
Take her.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.165
Calm down!

14:36.625 --> 14:37.750
It's over!

14:38.502 --> 14:40.128
All right, it's over.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.100
Excuse me, gentlemen.

14:59.481 --> 15:02.025
- You look like you could use this.
- Thank you.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.277
- David Grant.
- Michelle Thomas.

15:04.486 --> 15:05.904
- You like hockey?
- Love it.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.655
I've got two tickets...

15:07.865 --> 15:11.034
Are you Dr. Grant?
You have an urgent phone call.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.203
I'll be right back.

15:15.497 --> 15:16.539
Come on!

15:16.832 --> 15:19.417
Sit down. Sit! Sit!

15:33.307 --> 15:35.892
Attention, everyone on board.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.061
Listen carefully.

15:38.687 --> 15:41.648
Remain in your seats
with your belts fastened.

15:42.691 --> 15:43.858
Do as you're told...

15:44.860 --> 15:47.987
and there will be no need
for further violence.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.407
Jean.

16:03.837 --> 16:08.341
Where's the passenger manifest?

16:09.385 --> 16:10.885
I destroyed it.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.429
You destroyed it?

16:30.072 --> 16:31.155
To protect passengers?

16:32.866 --> 16:34.075
Or someone else?

16:41.041 --> 16:43.710
That was a very brave thing to do...

16:44.628 --> 16:47.046
and totally unnecessary.

16:58.058 --> 17:00.977
Here's the data.
Sorry to spoil your evening.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.770
That makes two of us.

17:02.938 --> 17:03.938
It's him, no doubt.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.482
One's a recording.
The one from the plane is live.

17:11.613 --> 17:12.739
This doesn't make sense.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.116
What the hell is he up to?

17:15.659 --> 17:16.784
General Wood called.

17:16.993 --> 17:20.246
Briefing at 6:00 in the Situation Room.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.749
- Pentagon?
- Welcome to the big leagues.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.917
White's running the show
in the president's absence.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.962
- Got anything I can wear?
- T-shirt.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.339
A jog bra and a pair of running shorts.

17:30.507 --> 17:31.799
Thanks anyway.

17:32.259 --> 17:33.468
Keep at it, guys.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.219
This is a think tank.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.679
They pay us to think.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.097
Oh. By the way...

17:38.682 --> 17:40.475
who heads the anti-terrorist unit?

17:40.726 --> 17:42.727
Colonel Austin Travis.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.687
Special Forces Command.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.439
You know him?

18:06.376 --> 18:07.668
Jesus.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.382
They said it was "come-as-you-are."

18:19.139 --> 18:20.932
- Excuse me.
- David Grant.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.477
This was recorded from the plane...

18:24.686 --> 18:26.854
shortly after the bombing.

18:28.398 --> 18:31.192
This is Al Tha'r.
I have a message for the president.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.654
The London bombing
indicates my resolve.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.573
I am in control of Flight 343.

18:37.908 --> 18:41.077
Its passengers
shall remain in my custody...

18:41.286 --> 18:43.621
until Abu Jaffa...

18:43.831 --> 18:45.915
is released from captivity.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.668
Follow my instructions precisely.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.546
No theater. No negotiation.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.924
Jaffa will be taken
to Gatwick Airport...

18:55.134 --> 18:59.137
where a jet will land,
then leave with him.

18:59.346 --> 19:02.890
On his release,
Flight 343 will go to Washington...

19:03.100 --> 19:05.768
where half the passengers
will be exchanged for fuel...

19:05.936 --> 19:08.062
and 50 million in gold bullion.

19:08.272 --> 19:12.733
Jaffa must be in communication
with me by 6 a. M...

19:12.943 --> 19:16.070
or London will suffer
another punishment...

19:16.405 --> 19:20.074
that will make today's bombing
pale in comparison.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.409
Mr. Grant.

19:22.703 --> 19:23.744
This man...

19:24.454 --> 19:26.497
AI Tha'r, who is he?

19:27.583 --> 19:30.251
Voice analysis confirms
it's Nagi Hassan...

19:30.586 --> 19:32.003
Jaffa's deputy director.

19:32.171 --> 19:36.257
He's an extremist.
Take him at his word. He's not bluffing.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.842
Thank you.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.386
Any other comments?

19:40.637 --> 19:44.724
It seems our posture must
be of containment.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.101
Acquiesce to Nagi's demands?

19:47.269 --> 19:49.312
I don't see any other choice.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.857
London is demanding action.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.275
I agree.

19:54.484 --> 19:57.361
I hate the idea of conceding
to that bastard.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.364
But if we get him on the ground,
we'll have options.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.743
Travis' team will respond
once the plane is at Dulles.

20:03.952 --> 20:07.288
It means shutting it down,
re-routing all traffic.

20:07.456 --> 20:10.291
A full military control of the area.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.171
Secretary White...

20:15.380 --> 20:17.215
Excuse me, gentlemen...

20:17.424 --> 20:20.259
I don't think we can allow
that plane to land...

20:20.469 --> 20:22.511
or even enter U.S. Airspace.

20:22.846 --> 20:23.930
What do you mean?

20:24.389 --> 20:27.016
I don't think this is about hostages.

20:27.392 --> 20:31.145
It's about one man planning
a major strike against the U.S.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.816
You'd better explain yourself.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.154
Our research leads me to believe...

20:40.364 --> 20:44.659
that due to his internal
political situation, Nagi Hassan...

20:45.035 --> 20:46.661
planned Jaffa's abduction.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.913
Go on.

20:49.289 --> 20:52.750
Six months ago,
a shipment of DZ-5 was hijacked...

20:52.960 --> 20:54.502
in transit to Germany.

20:54.711 --> 20:57.505
We're certain
the Chechen Mafia was behind it.

20:57.673 --> 21:01.008
But recent attempts to recover
the gas have failed.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.013
Rumors surfaced that the DZ-5...

21:06.181 --> 21:07.932
was in the hands of Asmed Rhasjami.

21:08.225 --> 21:11.227
This is the prick
who sent us on a wild goose chase.

21:12.187 --> 21:15.690
A supplier of arms and
explosives to Jaffa's group.

21:17.317 --> 21:18.693
Mr. Grant...

21:20.529 --> 21:23.698
are you saying the nerve gas
is on board?

21:24.241 --> 21:25.658
Yes, sir, I am.

21:25.867 --> 21:30.329
In my opinion, Hassan plans to
use the DZ-5 and the plane as a weapon.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.124
A sort of poor man's atomic bomb...

21:33.375 --> 21:36.252
to be detonated here,
over Washington.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.630
How much DZ-5 might he have?

21:40.257 --> 21:42.508
I can't be exact, sir.

21:42.759 --> 21:44.635
But I can tell you this:

21:45.554 --> 21:46.929
If this were DZ-5...

21:51.768 --> 21:55.187
that drop would be more than enough
to kill every man here.

22:02.237 --> 22:04.447
The name he's using, "Al Tha'r"...

22:04.656 --> 22:07.575
in ancient Arabic means "revenge."

22:16.001 --> 22:18.502
Welcome aboard, Senator Mavros.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.714
The press thinks you could be
the next president.

22:23.633 --> 22:26.260
It's an honor to have you with us.

22:44.654 --> 22:47.114
That plane will be here in 8 hours.

22:49.284 --> 22:52.620
The president has two options:

22:52.788 --> 22:54.622
Disregard Mr. Grant's theory...

22:54.831 --> 22:57.583
and let the plane proceed
to the U.S.

22:58.126 --> 23:00.836
Or destroy it before it gets here...

23:01.046 --> 23:03.798
along with 406 passengers.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.885
Even if we're right...

23:08.553 --> 23:10.679
how would we ever prove it?

23:17.479 --> 23:20.481
Colonel, if you have an opinion,
let's hear it.

23:20.649 --> 23:23.109
There is another possibility.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.694
It's a Hail Mary pass, but...

23:25.946 --> 23:27.822
Colonel, tell him what you need.

23:28.031 --> 23:31.867
There's a man named Dennis Cahill
who's an engineer for ARPA.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.578
If we could get him on the line ASAP...

23:35.539 --> 23:38.082
he can tell you what I have in mind.

23:41.545 --> 23:44.088
Remora was developed
for the space program...

23:44.506 --> 23:47.049
for low-orbit linkups with the shuttle.

23:47.259 --> 23:51.178
It has since been
modified by the Air Force...

23:51.388 --> 23:55.307
to study transferring
bomber crews at altitude...

23:55.517 --> 23:57.435
as well as other...

23:57.686 --> 23:58.686
contingencies.

23:59.062 --> 24:02.231
We've had six hookups, all successful.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.692
This is a civilian airliner.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.194
Mr. Cahill...

24:07.362 --> 24:11.657
do you mean Remora could work
with a 747?

24:12.284 --> 24:16.662
This application was never
intended for a civilian airliner.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.166
However, smooth-surface mating tests...

24:20.375 --> 24:22.710
were successful in a wind tunnel.

24:23.044 --> 24:24.211
A wind tunnel.

24:25.797 --> 24:29.258
I know you wrote the book on
assaulting hijacked aircraft.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.385
But this is 5 miles above Earth.

24:32.888 --> 24:36.557
Under the circumstances,
we don't have any other options.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.059
It's your call.

24:39.728 --> 24:43.814
We must be airborne in an hour,
six men. I'll need Mr. Cahill...

24:44.024 --> 24:45.524
to supervise the linkup.

24:47.736 --> 24:48.777
Mr. Cahill...

24:49.070 --> 24:51.572
you and the Remora
be ready in an hour.

24:53.909 --> 24:57.745
The press is in a feeding frenzy
about the hijacking.

24:58.121 --> 25:00.998
Especially with Senator Mavros
on board.

25:01.291 --> 25:04.960
Not a word of this operation
is to go beyond this room.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.088
Colonel. Anything you need, name it.

25:09.090 --> 25:13.052
We'll need all the on-site intel
we can get.

25:13.261 --> 25:17.264
I think Mr. Grant could
provide us with a great advantage.

25:18.266 --> 25:21.644
And I'd just love to
have him come along.

25:22.604 --> 25:23.729
Mr. Grant?

25:24.606 --> 25:26.190
You ready to take a plane ride...

25:26.525 --> 25:29.276
in the interest of national security?

25:31.488 --> 25:32.905
Of course.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.029
Check it out. It's the colonel.

26:26.668 --> 26:28.669
Didn't have details on the op...

26:28.837 --> 26:31.213
so we brought everything,
even condoms!

26:33.466 --> 26:35.509
Who's this, 007?

26:36.386 --> 26:38.846
That's Mr. Grant, with Intelligence.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.806
He'll travel with us partway.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.182
Partway?

26:42.350 --> 26:44.184
I'll explain on the bird. Let's go.

27:14.674 --> 27:16.550
So where's the 130?

27:17.093 --> 27:18.719
Sergeant Baker...

27:19.387 --> 27:21.388
I reckon that's it.

27:46.915 --> 27:49.083
You're joking, right?

27:49.459 --> 27:51.752
Too much gear.
We won't get off the ground.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.755
Break it down, boys.
Close-quarter weapons...

27:54.923 --> 27:57.424
com units, ordinance,
sleep agent. Dump the rest.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.427
Yes, sir.

28:06.184 --> 28:10.938
Andrews ground,
Remora, hangar three, taxi for takeoff.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.826
It's all hooked up.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.126
Oh, God.

29:14.335 --> 29:16.503
Allison's been gone a long time.

29:16.713 --> 29:20.758
They wouldn't leave her there alone.
Something's wrong.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.233
Let's go through this.

29:38.943 --> 29:42.529
Baker, set up the com link
with the plane and the Pentagon.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.365
- Grant monitors.
- But I stay here?

29:45.742 --> 29:47.201
That's correct.

29:47.410 --> 29:51.079
The Remora will refuel in flight,
then trail the 747.

29:51.414 --> 29:53.874
You'll be in video and
audio contact with us.

29:54.083 --> 29:57.878
Your assessment
of Nagi's behavior is essential.

29:58.254 --> 29:59.463
I'll do what I can.

30:00.048 --> 30:01.548
Once we find the bad guys...

30:01.925 --> 30:03.425
we'll look for the DZ-5.

30:03.676 --> 30:06.720
If we find it, you'll tap
into the oxygen supply...

30:07.096 --> 30:10.432
with the sleep agent.
Lights out. We take the bird.

30:10.975 --> 30:14.019
Once we've taken control, we'll divert.

30:14.395 --> 30:15.729
Any problems, any questions?

30:15.897 --> 30:17.064
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.732
Greenland's our best bet.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.567
If the bomb has a short fuse...

30:20.735 --> 30:23.862
then my ass'll rain over Greenland?
I don't think so.

30:24.072 --> 30:26.240
That's why I get the big bucks.

30:26.491 --> 30:29.117
- For what?
- To save your ass.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.203
That's what I want to hear.

31:14.330 --> 31:15.622
The safehouse in Trieste...

31:16.583 --> 31:18.250
that was your intel.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.627
The nerve gas was there, Colonel.

31:21.254 --> 31:22.921
Operation was late.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.507
If you say so.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.803
I hope your averages improve.

31:30.513 --> 31:32.306
If you don't believe me...

31:32.807 --> 31:33.974
why are you here?

31:36.311 --> 31:38.145
Who else will do it?

31:40.106 --> 31:41.148
You?

31:47.280 --> 31:48.363
My men are hungry.

31:49.198 --> 31:50.365
See to it.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.826
The food's in the lower galley.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.453
I must use the elevator.

31:55.538 --> 31:56.580
All right.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.207
What about the passengers?

31:59.459 --> 32:02.169
They need something,
especially the children.

32:03.922 --> 32:07.090
They may have beverages
and use the bathrooms.

32:07.675 --> 32:08.842
You're responsible.

32:09.427 --> 32:12.512
Anything suspicious will
bring about repercussions.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.014
Understood?

32:15.350 --> 32:16.475
Yes.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.530
My God.

32:30.698 --> 32:33.367
Allison? Allison?

32:52.303 --> 32:55.389
Satellite tracking indicates
our intercept here.

32:56.057 --> 32:58.809
That'll give you four hours
to complete your mission.

32:59.143 --> 33:02.479
Our target is the hatch near
the nose of the plane.

33:07.485 --> 33:10.612
As soon as we lock on,
I'll raise the sleeve.

33:10.822 --> 33:14.199
When it's pressurized,
I'll open the hatch of the 747.

33:14.409 --> 33:16.827
When you're inside, I'll lock it.

33:17.036 --> 33:18.286
Baker must go first.

33:18.496 --> 33:22.499
The alarm on the hatch must be
neutralized. Tell him how.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.419
I can't just do that.

33:25.586 --> 33:27.546
It's not a B-52 with a docking collar.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.381
It's a 747 without one.

33:29.590 --> 33:32.092
Equalization process is delicate.

33:32.885 --> 33:34.636
If the seal's not the proper vacuum...

33:34.804 --> 33:37.222
both planes could decompress.
Our mission's over.

33:41.894 --> 33:45.272
This is what we'll do.
Baker follows right behind you.

33:45.481 --> 33:49.776
When the hatch opens, get inside
so Baker can lock off the switch.

33:50.153 --> 33:53.447
As soon as we're on board,
you go reseal the hatch.

33:53.781 --> 33:57.659
I'll clip the circuit from the ladder.
I don't need to go on the plane.

33:58.244 --> 33:59.870
That's how it's going to be.

34:00.079 --> 34:01.204
I'm an engineer...

34:01.789 --> 34:03.206
That's it.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.594
Target sighted.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.043
Initiating approach.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.470
Climbing to flight level 3-8-5.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.348
Activating Doppler imaging system.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.355
1000 meters and closing.

35:08.815 --> 35:09.856
750.

35:10.858 --> 35:12.567
500.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.153
350.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.781
We have heavy turbulence.

35:18.616 --> 35:21.201
Only eight to ten seconds of this.

35:23.037 --> 35:26.498
We're entering the slipstream.
In a moment it'll settle.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.713
See that path?

35:33.881 --> 35:36.049
That's the sweet spot.

35:36.551 --> 35:39.010
We'll be on it in two seconds.

35:44.475 --> 35:46.518
We're ready, Mr. Cahill.

35:48.771 --> 35:51.189
Primary laser targeting.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.527
Switch to master. And locked.

36:05.037 --> 36:07.455
Switching to dorsal camera system.

36:14.881 --> 36:16.256
Range to target:

36:16.465 --> 36:17.507
Thirty meters.

36:19.677 --> 36:20.927
Target point in sight.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.765
Call the approach.

36:26.767 --> 36:30.604
Steady.

36:31.230 --> 36:32.564
Left 0.5.

36:36.319 --> 36:37.611
Forward one.

36:38.821 --> 36:40.447
Easy.

36:43.701 --> 36:44.743
You're right on it.

36:45.578 --> 36:46.995
You're on it.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.122
Hold it right there.

36:49.290 --> 36:50.332
Lock.

36:51.292 --> 36:52.959
Prepare target for linkup.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.295
Extending the sleeve.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.550
- Activate.
- Roger.

37:18.110 --> 37:19.569
Autopilot on.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.364
We're engaged.

37:43.469 --> 37:45.637
Primary tunnel pressurized and stable.

37:46.013 --> 37:47.222
I'm going up.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.412
Baker. Do it.

38:24.719 --> 38:25.844
Seal looks good.

38:28.222 --> 38:30.181
We got a stable vacuum.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.561
I'm opening the outer hatch.

38:59.628 --> 39:02.172
- What's that, a short?
- I don't know.

39:06.260 --> 39:07.302
Move it.

39:08.929 --> 39:10.513
Come on.

39:10.931 --> 39:13.058
Move your ass.

39:19.482 --> 39:21.024
Yeah. Yup.

39:23.944 --> 39:26.696
- Your turn.
- Sir.

39:34.997 --> 39:36.414
A little bumpy.

39:47.968 --> 39:49.010
What's that?

39:49.470 --> 39:51.179
That's a warning light.

39:51.389 --> 39:54.224
It's for an open hatch
in the avionics room.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.810
That's impossible.
The plane is pressurized.

39:57.311 --> 39:59.354
- Where is this room?
- Below.

39:59.522 --> 40:01.106
It's under the first-class cabin.

40:05.778 --> 40:07.153
Rat, you're next.

40:07.947 --> 40:09.531
Doc, the bags.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.826
Hope there's a good movie on this flight.

40:16.455 --> 40:17.705
Cappy.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.461
Clear. Next.

40:23.629 --> 40:25.713
Come on.

40:28.300 --> 40:29.843
Where's the clip?

40:30.052 --> 40:32.387
- You put it in?
- It was there.

40:32.555 --> 40:33.930
You're on my shit list.

40:36.016 --> 40:38.017
Hold up, we lost the clip.

40:44.608 --> 40:45.692
Let's go! Let's go!

40:57.955 --> 40:59.205
Got it.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.500
Come on.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.420
See, it went out. It's a short.

41:06.922 --> 41:08.173
Why aren't we climbing?

41:09.216 --> 41:11.259
Come on, old man, move it.

41:15.264 --> 41:16.848
- What the hell?
- Wind shear.

41:25.691 --> 41:26.816
Cappy.

41:31.906 --> 41:33.239
Climb!

41:38.621 --> 41:40.205
We are passing 330!

41:44.251 --> 41:45.752
320!

41:45.920 --> 41:46.961
What's going on?

41:47.213 --> 41:48.963
We have to break off now!

41:50.257 --> 41:51.591
I can't hold the seal!

41:52.426 --> 41:54.594
We got to pull him up.

41:56.263 --> 41:59.682
- Grant! What are you doing?
- Let's move it!

42:00.017 --> 42:02.143
Now! Now! Now!

42:04.063 --> 42:05.772
He's unconscious!

42:05.981 --> 42:07.106
Get above him!

42:08.692 --> 42:09.734
Hold on.

42:10.152 --> 42:11.277
Pull him up.

42:11.820 --> 42:13.196
All right.

42:13.405 --> 42:15.615
Get him out! Move it!

42:15.783 --> 42:16.950
Get above him!

42:21.413 --> 42:22.747
Pull!

42:25.918 --> 42:29.629
We got him. Now get out of there. Move.

42:29.797 --> 42:32.340
Why is she so goddamn heavy?

42:34.176 --> 42:35.468
Jesus, they're climbing.

42:35.844 --> 42:37.095
I'm climbing with them.

42:48.732 --> 42:50.149
Too much stress on the sleeve!

42:58.909 --> 43:00.410
We're losing pressure.

43:01.036 --> 43:04.247
The seals are going. Listen to me.

43:04.415 --> 43:07.166
Close the hatch now
or we'll lose both planes.

43:07.501 --> 43:08.501
Come on!

43:08.752 --> 43:10.169
Grab my hand!

43:11.880 --> 43:14.090
I can't hold it. Close the hatch.

43:15.217 --> 43:16.676
Lower the sleeve!

43:21.181 --> 43:25.310
Listen to me. Close the hatch now
or we'll all die.

43:26.312 --> 43:27.854
- We're losing pressure!
- Colonel.

43:32.276 --> 43:34.193
We're not going to make it!

43:36.614 --> 43:37.655
You are!

44:03.015 --> 44:04.432
She's gone.

44:07.728 --> 44:10.897
Castle Rock, Big Eye Six.
We lost contact with Hail Mary.

44:11.065 --> 44:14.817
- Repeat, we've lost contact.
- Big Eye Six, was delivery accomplished?

44:15.027 --> 44:19.238
Can't say. Hail Mary was attempting
delivery when contact ended.

44:19.448 --> 44:21.366
Did they make it on board?

44:21.575 --> 44:25.745
If they did, they'll establish a link
with us. Admiral, where's the fleet?

44:25.913 --> 44:30.208
The carrier group's heading to
an intercept point in the Atlantic.

44:31.043 --> 44:32.752
Have them go to alert.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.285
Cappy.

45:06.537 --> 45:07.578
Cappy.

45:18.882 --> 45:21.217
I have to check the equipment
in the avionics room.

45:22.636 --> 45:24.137
Show me this room.

45:25.180 --> 45:26.472
Yeah.

45:34.106 --> 45:37.567
There's a depression.
A deformity of C-7.

45:37.776 --> 45:42.363
He's got a fractured vertebrae.
We have to immobilize him.

45:50.831 --> 45:53.624
Excuse me, folks.
Can you move over here, please?

45:53.792 --> 45:54.959
- Move.
- Sorry.

45:56.003 --> 45:58.504
Hang on, Cappy, you old dog.

46:05.345 --> 46:07.513
Buddy, you got some morphine here.

46:07.681 --> 46:09.140
That'll help the pain.

46:17.900 --> 46:21.402
Hey. Give me a break.
You go down there.

46:21.653 --> 46:23.029
Quiet.

47:23.257 --> 47:24.298
Go.

47:46.947 --> 47:48.614
It's a fried circuit.

47:48.824 --> 47:50.992
It's an overload of some kind.

47:51.952 --> 47:53.411
It happens.

48:36.830 --> 48:38.164
Close it.

48:39.374 --> 48:40.458
Sure.

49:11.406 --> 49:13.032
Everything okay?

49:13.200 --> 49:16.786
Yeah. Just a blown circuit.

49:17.454 --> 49:19.372
Must've been the turbulence.

49:36.807 --> 49:39.934
Rat. What'll we do?

49:44.356 --> 49:47.817
Hey, Baker.
Get me the Pentagon on sat-com.

49:55.075 --> 49:56.242
The radio didn't make it.

50:00.414 --> 50:04.291
We have no way to tell them
we're on board. They'll think we're dead.

50:04.751 --> 50:06.293
Shut up, Cahill.

50:06.545 --> 50:10.464
He's right. As far as they know,
we went down with the plane.

50:10.716 --> 50:13.718
The Pentagon is going to shoot us down.

50:19.391 --> 50:21.142
We were their only option.

50:24.271 --> 50:26.188
Right. Listen to me.

50:27.774 --> 50:28.899
We must negotiate.

50:29.151 --> 50:31.652
Tell Hassan the Pentagon
knows his plan...

50:31.862 --> 50:34.697
and he'll never be allowed
to reach U.S. Airspace.

50:34.906 --> 50:36.615
- Calm down.
- I'm fine.

50:36.825 --> 50:38.617
I know what I'm talking about.

50:38.785 --> 50:40.786
We have to. It's our only chance.

50:40.954 --> 50:42.121
They've got to listen.

50:42.330 --> 50:43.789
That won't stop them.

50:51.298 --> 50:53.299
- Get your hands off.
- You're not going anywhere.

50:53.508 --> 50:55.968
I didn't sign up for this G.I.
Joe bullshit.

50:56.303 --> 50:59.972
We don't need to do that.
He'll be all right.

51:00.140 --> 51:03.059
Okay, Cahill. Listen to me.

51:03.268 --> 51:06.353
There is no negotiating
with Nagi Hassan. Understand?

51:06.730 --> 51:08.856
If he knew we were here, he'd kill us.

51:09.232 --> 51:14.070
So let's calm down, everybody.

51:14.237 --> 51:16.489
Just sit down and relax.

51:19.326 --> 51:21.702
With no way to communicate, he's right.

51:21.912 --> 51:24.038
They'll blow us out of the sky.

51:24.372 --> 51:26.165
They don't know we're not on board.

51:26.500 --> 51:29.126
They'll wait until the last second,
hoping for a break.

51:29.336 --> 51:30.836
We've got some time.

51:33.090 --> 51:36.008
How much time
before we hit U.S. Airspace?

51:37.719 --> 51:39.220
Three hours, 50 minutes.

51:41.556 --> 51:42.681
What's left of the gear?

51:43.308 --> 51:44.725
We've lost the sat-com...

51:44.935 --> 51:47.353
scanners, sleep agent.

51:47.521 --> 51:51.232
We've got half the weapons, probes,
mikes, bomb kit. That's it.

51:51.691 --> 51:55.027
It's vital you find Hassan.
It all centers around him.

51:58.990 --> 52:00.032
All right.

52:00.242 --> 52:01.659
Mikes and probes first.

52:02.119 --> 52:05.371
Hook up Grant to the com board.
See if he can locate Hassan.

52:06.206 --> 52:07.623
Everything we need is here.

52:07.833 --> 52:11.210
We locate their positions,
blow the lights and go night optics.

52:11.461 --> 52:14.713
We hit them hard while they're
still surprised. Let's go.

52:15.549 --> 52:16.799
The bomb.

52:17.801 --> 52:20.636
We don't know if there is one.
I'll take over the plane.

52:20.804 --> 52:23.889
- That's what Travis would do.
- I'm not telling you what to do.

52:24.975 --> 52:28.811
But if the DZ-5's on board,
there's a bomb attached. Find it.

52:29.187 --> 52:33.232
Once this plane left, Hassan made sure
there was no turning back.

52:33.859 --> 52:35.067
He's right.

52:35.944 --> 52:39.572
It could be a pressure-switch timer.
If you land or change altitude...

52:39.781 --> 52:43.993
anything could set it off.
You must find it before they hit.

52:44.161 --> 52:45.578
All right.

52:45.912 --> 52:48.247
We'll look for it while we're setting up.

52:48.415 --> 52:50.249
Get the tools and bomb kits.

52:50.458 --> 52:51.625
Let's get started.

52:54.337 --> 52:56.172
Tell me what Hassan looks like.

52:58.508 --> 52:59.800
I can't.

53:00.010 --> 53:02.887
What do you mean?
You're the world's expert on him.

53:03.096 --> 53:07.141
The only known photograph of him
was taken over 25 years ago.

53:07.976 --> 53:09.018
Jesus.

53:09.311 --> 53:11.228
But I'd recognize his voice.

53:11.813 --> 53:14.064
I'd know him if I saw him.

53:25.452 --> 53:28.662
I'm telling you, I saw them. Americans.

53:28.830 --> 53:30.247
Soldiers.

57:43.918 --> 57:46.587
Okay. Baker, station one.

57:46.796 --> 57:48.922
First class, online.

57:49.340 --> 57:50.424
Go ahead.

57:55.221 --> 57:57.723
Okay, I've got one, first-class cabin.

58:04.063 --> 58:05.481
Now another.

58:05.940 --> 58:07.483
Skorpions on both of them.

58:11.654 --> 58:13.322
Grant, do you copy?

58:15.450 --> 58:16.658
I hear them.

58:19.412 --> 58:20.579
Neither one is Hassan.

58:29.881 --> 58:31.924
Four in the main cabin, two in the galley.

58:32.342 --> 58:35.761
Four with nine-millimeter skorpions,
two AKM/FNC's.

58:37.430 --> 58:39.473
Two more patrolling the rear cabin.

58:39.682 --> 58:41.225
Heavily armed.

58:44.354 --> 58:45.812
Can you hear them in the galley?

58:46.189 --> 58:48.106
Yeah. Yeah, I hear them.

58:50.944 --> 58:52.528
None of them is our man.

58:52.695 --> 58:55.614
This isn't working.
Meet me in the lower galley.

58:55.782 --> 58:57.658
Put on Cappy's vest.

58:58.785 --> 59:00.452
I'm on my way.

59:31.484 --> 59:33.735
All right, clip the cable to your vest.

59:36.948 --> 59:39.157
Okay. Put on your carabiner.

59:39.325 --> 59:40.867
I'll winch you up.

59:46.457 --> 59:47.541
Easy.

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:18.989
All right. I got four probes
and mikes down there.

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:20.574
It covers the main cabin.

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:22.951
If he's there, you should find him.

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:32.169
Okay. Whatever you do...

01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:35.130
don't step on the panel
or you'll go through.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.049
I'll try to remember that.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:45.057
All right.

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:47.559
Right here.

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:52.856
Hey, wait. Lose the shoes, pretty boy.

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:56.068
Hope the smell doesn't give us away.

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:58.445
Okay. Go.

01:02:02.677 --> 01:02:03.719
Senator, I...

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:06.346
Shut up. Do you want to get us killed?

01:02:10.017 --> 01:02:14.146
I think we're being presented with
an incredible opportunity here.

01:02:14.355 --> 01:02:15.772
For what?

01:02:16.315 --> 01:02:19.484
We always wanted to have
a war record for you.

01:02:19.652 --> 01:02:22.904
Some edge with the media
that would put you over the top.

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:25.657
Remember the mileage
Jesse Jackson got...

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:28.785
when he negotiated
that hostage release?

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:31.163
Yeah.

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:39.212
I'm at the last one.

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:40.797
He's not here.

01:02:41.215 --> 01:02:42.549
Maybe he's in the cockpit.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.384
Come on back.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:46.845
Okay.

01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:14.080
Come on, I got you.

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.125
I got you, it's okay.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.213
All right. That's it.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:25.258
Just keep tugging. Good. You got it.

01:03:26.385 --> 01:03:28.303
Get your arm in over there.

01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:44.528
Maintain current course.

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:48.406
Shit.

01:03:52.119 --> 01:03:53.411
Thanks.

01:03:53.871 --> 01:03:55.622
Let's get down from here.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:23.900
Stop.

01:04:24.068 --> 01:04:25.110
What's going on?

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:35.829
I'm sorry, it fell. I was...

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:37.706
getting coffee filters.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.296
I don't understand.

01:04:44.463 --> 01:04:46.298
How does threatening these people...

01:04:46.507 --> 01:04:49.384
have anything to do with your cause?

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:51.803
It's not your place to understand.

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:54.472
Just be patient.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.725
It'll all be over very soon.

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.572
There's a change.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:11.948
Maintain our course.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.555
Excuse me.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:04.042
I'm keeping you from your work.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:21.518
Are you okay? What happened?

01:06:21.852 --> 01:06:23.520
Are you okay?

01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:25.355
Yeah.

01:06:26.732 --> 01:06:28.900
And guess who I ran into?

01:06:57.138 --> 01:06:58.263
Rat.

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:01.808
Forward baggage compartment.
Got something.

01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:03.643
I'm on my way.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:16.781
You wanted to talk to me.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:21.995
I'm sure you're aware the official
U.S. Policy is no deals with terrorists.

01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:24.873
Especially in hostage situations.

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:30.462
I can deal directly with the president.

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:33.631
If you allow me to conduct
the negotiation...

01:07:33.799 --> 01:07:35.717
I can guarantee your demands.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:39.387
Money, media exposure,
safe passage to the Middle East.

01:07:40.681 --> 01:07:42.015
I understand.

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:45.268
You want to be seen
as the savior of the hostages.

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:49.606
An image that won't hurt you
in the elections.

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:53.234
As powerful an image as you returning
to the Middle East, mission accomplished.

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:57.530
We are both men who truly understand...

01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.658
the importance of making
dramatic statements.

01:08:03.954 --> 01:08:07.665
Rest assured, when the time comes,
I will call upon you.

01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:21.054
Your theory was right.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:23.348
Have a look.

01:08:37.321 --> 01:08:39.572
You can forget Washington.

01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:44.493
There's enough nerve agent here to
wipe out half the Eastern Seaboard.

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:53.044
Israeli intelligence has identified
the bomb-maker.

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:55.546
He's Jean-Paul Demou.

01:08:55.714 --> 01:08:57.631
That's a recent photograph.

01:08:57.841 --> 01:08:59.384
French-Algerian.

01:08:59.718 --> 01:09:01.845
Former nuclear engineer with the Iraqis.

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.971
Lost his family in the Gulf War.

01:09:04.223 --> 01:09:06.390
He's been with Jaffa's group since.

01:09:07.475 --> 01:09:09.602
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:15.316
It's been over an hour
and no word from Travis.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.484
We're running out of options.

01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:24.826
There's still time.

01:09:25.243 --> 01:09:28.037
Instruct the F-14's
to be ready to launch.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:31.582
Issue the press release of
the president's decision to free Jaffa.

01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:35.252
That bastard might be
our last avenue of hope.

01:09:51.103 --> 01:09:53.313
We have no means
to communicate with him.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:57.108
But he has arranged to contact you
as soon as you're airborne.

01:09:57.651 --> 01:10:01.529
I can assure you, that plane
won't be allowed to reach the U.S.

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:05.450
If you can convince him...

01:10:05.659 --> 01:10:08.119
to divert the aircraft
to an isolated base...

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:09.996
and release the passengers...

01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:13.458
he has the word of the president
of the United States...

01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:17.086
he and his men will be given
passage to any country.

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:21.633
I'll do everything I can...

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:24.886
in the interests of peace.

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:09.430
Sorry, Cappy. We got a bad one here.

01:11:10.182 --> 01:11:11.808
Okay. So...

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:16.896
we know we've got DZ-5
in binary canisters...

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:19.065
and 16 pounds of Semtex.

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:20.650
Let's take a look inside.

01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:29.033
A computer trigger.

01:11:29.868 --> 01:11:31.911
Microprocessor.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.622
Dedicated drive...

01:11:35.582 --> 01:11:38.251
probably monitor a dozen sensors.

01:11:38.502 --> 01:11:41.337
This ain't no pipe bomb
with a six-volt battery.

01:11:44.883 --> 01:11:46.551
Take me closer.

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:51.889
Stop.

01:11:52.391 --> 01:11:54.017
Take me in on that.

01:11:58.439 --> 01:11:59.897
There.

01:12:00.065 --> 01:12:01.190
What are you looking at?

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:03.901
That long, silver cylinder.

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:07.113
That's a barometric pressure switch.

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:11.576
Activated on takeoff, probably
set to airburst during landing...

01:12:14.246 --> 01:12:16.164
with an isolated trigger.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:20.376
I tell you what...

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:21.711
if I can...

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:24.672
I mean...

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:28.259
if you can disable the switch,
it'll buy you some time.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:30.428
Then we got a chance.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:35.600
We shut it down, take over
the plane, land it someplace safe.

01:12:36.268 --> 01:12:37.935
All right.

01:12:39.146 --> 01:12:41.147
Who gets to play with the bomb?

01:12:47.404 --> 01:12:49.655
- What about Cahill?
- Cahill.

01:12:49.948 --> 01:12:52.408
He's a design engineer.
If he can build a computer...

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.410
he can take one apart.

01:12:54.953 --> 01:12:56.079
What do you think?

01:12:56.246 --> 01:12:59.290
We're looking up the ass of a
dead dog, but it's worth a try.

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:01.918
But hurry, the morphine's kicking in.

01:13:03.962 --> 01:13:05.213
Let's do it.

01:13:05.422 --> 01:13:07.048
Get Cahill in here.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.299
Overhead mid-cabin.

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:12.220
First class. I'll take the cockpit
and business class.

01:13:12.429 --> 01:13:15.139
Use Channel B to Grant,
keep A open for assault.

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:16.808
I think you have problem.

01:13:16.975 --> 01:13:21.187
I counted four in mid-cabin,
but there could be six.

01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:24.065
Can you take them all?

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:28.361
I could take three or four,
but that's pushing it.

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:32.490
We need another gun.

01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:44.627
What do you want me to do?

01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:17.034
Jesus.

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:29.964
We're doing a simple electronic bypass.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:31.507
Ignore the rest of it.

01:14:34.094 --> 01:14:36.220
Just ignore...

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:37.763
the rest of it.

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:40.141
If you screw up, you'll never know it.

01:14:43.228 --> 01:14:44.395
So...

01:14:45.272 --> 01:14:46.647
let's get to it.

01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:52.445
Once more.

01:14:53.864 --> 01:14:56.032
Push hard, up the ladder...

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:58.743
left in the companionway.

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:00.828
I'll surprise them.

01:15:01.079 --> 01:15:02.497
That's it. You got it.

01:15:02.706 --> 01:15:03.915
This isn't my thing.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:05.875
With that, you can't miss.

01:15:06.084 --> 01:15:08.336
Just aim for his chest and fire.

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:10.922
Whatever you do,
don't look into his eyes.

01:15:11.131 --> 01:15:12.965
Then come back down the hall.

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.777
Okay, Cahill.

01:15:33.278 --> 01:15:35.196
Meter reads 15 ohms.

01:15:35.405 --> 01:15:38.574
That's good. That means
it's in parallel and isolated.

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:40.618
Let's complete the bypass.

01:16:00.305 --> 01:16:01.722
Okay.

01:16:12.776 --> 01:16:16.153
Now take the red alligator clips
and set in the bypass.

01:16:52.733 --> 01:16:54.025
Okay.

01:16:54.192 --> 01:16:56.193
Now take the red-handled dikes...

01:16:56.403 --> 01:16:59.071
and put the red wire on this side.

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:01.782
But don't touch anything else.

01:17:12.919 --> 01:17:15.379
Ready, forward section. Sit-rep.

01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:20.551
Louie. Ready.

01:17:21.928 --> 01:17:23.512
Baker.

01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:26.557
Baker up.

01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:28.309
- Grant?
- Grant.

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.019
I'm ready.

01:17:49.706 --> 01:17:51.207
Do it.

01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:56.587
Okay.

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:04.512
Tell them it's all theirs.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:06.806
Thank God.

01:18:07.599 --> 01:18:09.058
Rat.

01:18:09.726 --> 01:18:11.811
Cappy says the bomb is safe.

01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:13.896
The dude's in my sights.

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:17.108
I'll blow the lights,
and we go on my signal.

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:35.543
Oh, Jesus.

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:38.379
Stop them. Tell Rat to stop the attack.

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:43.759
Rat, stop the hit.

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:45.428
Cappy says to stop the attack.

01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:48.347
Hold positions.

01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:55.688
What's going on?

01:18:57.482 --> 01:18:59.734
Someone ran a program test
on the bomb.

01:19:01.194 --> 01:19:02.361
Whoever it is...

01:19:02.612 --> 01:19:04.572
has an override switch
with his finger...

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.073
on the damned trigger.

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:07.992
Can you override it?

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:14.498
Cappy. Cappy.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.375
I said, can you override it?

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:23.174
Cappy. Cappy.

01:19:23.508 --> 01:19:24.842
Cappy.

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:26.135
What's going on?

01:19:35.228 --> 01:19:37.563
I... I think we might have lost Cappy.

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:40.357
Cappy's dead. I think Cappy's dead.

01:19:40.692 --> 01:19:42.026
Calm down.

01:19:42.194 --> 01:19:43.360
I'll be right there.

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:48.199
What happened?

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:12.765
Rat. Cappy's okay.

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:14.058
Just unconscious.

01:20:37.249 --> 01:20:38.374
I am free and in flight.

01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:42.753
The Americans wish me to tell you...

01:20:43.588 --> 01:20:45.589
they agree to all your demands.

01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:48.425
You are victorious. Come home.

01:20:49.928 --> 01:20:52.471
I rejoice in your freedom, Abu Jaffa.

01:20:53.223 --> 01:20:55.182
Allah has blessed us.

01:20:55.433 --> 01:20:57.852
A great destiny awaits us both.

01:20:58.728 --> 01:21:01.939
You'll see I've achieved
a glorious victory on your behalf.

01:21:02.941 --> 01:21:06.277
All of Islam will
embrace you as its chosen leader.

01:21:06.444 --> 01:21:09.154
I am your flame. The sword of Allah.

01:21:09.656 --> 01:21:13.033
And with it I will strike deep
into the heart of the infidel.

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:16.954
Listen to me! They know!
They will destroy the plane!

01:21:17.163 --> 01:21:18.205
Listen!

01:21:23.628 --> 01:21:24.670
He cut him off.

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:27.381
Christ.

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:37.141
Jaffa's free.

01:21:39.102 --> 01:21:40.436
Jaffa's free!

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:45.858
What does it mean?

01:21:50.363 --> 01:21:52.698
Anytime, guys. Anytime.

01:22:03.001 --> 01:22:06.670
Tell Admiral Crosby to order
the F-14's to intercept the 747.

01:22:07.047 --> 01:22:09.006
Make the plane divert.

01:22:09.507 --> 01:22:10.507
Do it.

01:22:12.177 --> 01:22:13.260
Jack.

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:15.012
Call the president.

01:22:15.722 --> 01:22:17.848
It's an executive decision now.

01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:00.057
Nagi.

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:03.852
Now that Abu Jaffa's free,
shall I order the plane to Algeria?

01:23:05.563 --> 01:23:07.815
- No.
- Why?

01:23:13.238 --> 01:23:14.947
- What's going on?
- Jaffa's been freed.

01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:20.577
The second-in-command
is challenging Hassan.

01:23:20.954 --> 01:23:22.413
He wants to know...

01:23:23.248 --> 01:23:26.875
why they're not diverting to Algeria
now that Jaffa's been released.

01:23:27.377 --> 01:23:32.089
Allah has chosen for us a task
far greater than Jaffa's freedom.

01:23:33.758 --> 01:23:36.343
We are the true soldiers of Islam.

01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:41.056
Our destiny is to deliver the vengeance
of Allah into the belly of the infidel.

01:23:44.227 --> 01:23:47.771
This has nothing to do with Islam.
It is not Allah's will.

01:23:47.939 --> 01:23:51.442
You're blinded by hatred.
I'll have nothing to do with it.

01:23:51.609 --> 01:23:54.653
Our mission was to free Abu Jaffa.
He is our leader, not you.

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:15.591
What happened?

01:24:18.053 --> 01:24:20.304
- He just killed one of his men.
- What?

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:27.186
Get back to your posts.

01:24:33.401 --> 01:24:36.570
You son of a bitch.
What'd you get me into?

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:39.490
- What did you get me into?
- Senator...

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:43.869
The others can't know about the bomb.

01:24:45.955 --> 01:24:49.249
But somebody ran a test.
There must be a sleeper.

01:24:49.667 --> 01:24:51.335
Triggerman. One of the passengers.

01:24:51.878 --> 01:24:54.171
There're 400 passengers.
It could be anyone.

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:55.714
No way we'll find him.

01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:57.966
We still have the element of surprise.

01:24:58.176 --> 01:25:01.011
Let's hit them now,
forget the bomb and maybe get lucky.

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:04.723
Even if you kill them all,
the sleeper can destroy the plane.

01:25:06.476 --> 01:25:08.811
But at least we'll save Washington.

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:13.941
We're out of time.
This is the best option we have.

01:25:15.026 --> 01:25:16.193
Maybe not.

01:25:16.694 --> 01:25:19.029
We still got an hour and 20 minutes.

01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:22.533
Listen, we must give
that bomb another try.

01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:24.535
You need Cappy for that.

01:25:24.744 --> 01:25:26.453
- Maybe Cahill can.
- Forget it.

01:25:26.663 --> 01:25:29.998
If he can neutralize it,
finding the sleeper won't matter.

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:31.583
And if he can't?

01:25:32.168 --> 01:25:33.877
Then we must find the sleeper.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:35.587
But I think...

01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:38.215
I know who it might be.

01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:39.842
Can you hook up a probe...

01:25:40.051 --> 01:25:42.469
so I can see
into the cabin on this monitor?

01:25:43.429 --> 01:25:46.849
We can't transmit between
the probe and the monitor.

01:25:47.016 --> 01:25:48.725
- Would a video camera work?
- Yeah.

01:25:48.893 --> 01:25:50.227
- You got one?
- No.

01:25:50.728 --> 01:25:51.854
Shit.

01:25:53.231 --> 01:25:55.899
Baggage. We'll find one in baggage.

01:25:57.068 --> 01:25:58.819
There are 400 faces up there.

01:25:59.028 --> 01:26:01.029
You'll check each one?

01:26:01.614 --> 01:26:03.073
Not without help.

01:26:10.248 --> 01:26:12.082
Where's the weak link?

01:26:13.042 --> 01:26:15.502
How do we pull
the teeth on this thing?

01:26:17.922 --> 01:26:20.799
Come on, you're an engineer.
Go with your instincts.

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:27.848
Cappy said two power sources.

01:26:28.808 --> 01:26:30.142
This is one.

01:26:30.768 --> 01:26:32.936
I'm pretty sure this is the other.

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:36.732
If we had our own power supply...

01:26:38.109 --> 01:26:40.777
we could isolate
the bomb's power sources...

01:26:41.404 --> 01:26:42.946
like a heart bypass machine.

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:44.740
The bomb'll think it's online.

01:26:44.949 --> 01:26:48.452
Along with the sleeper. With no power,
no detonation. Brilliant.

01:26:48.912 --> 01:26:50.621
In theory.

01:26:50.788 --> 01:26:52.080
That's all we've got.

01:27:11.809 --> 01:27:15.229
Cahill, you're the man.
Go with your instincts.

01:27:23.154 --> 01:27:25.489
I hope I'm right.

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:29.952
Whatever you do, don't cut that wire.

01:27:31.454 --> 01:27:33.163
Cappy.

01:27:37.001 --> 01:27:39.920
We found a camcorder in baggage.
We're ready to try this.

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:41.880
Be right there.

01:27:42.966 --> 01:27:45.342
What? You can't leave now.

01:27:47.136 --> 01:27:48.345
You've got Cappy.

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:52.140
What if he passes out again?

01:27:52.892 --> 01:27:54.977
If things really get desperate...

01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:58.355
use your magic wand.

01:28:15.456 --> 01:28:17.374
Okay. I got power.

01:28:18.751 --> 01:28:22.546
Got the cable down the elevator shaft.
They won't see it.

01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:29.469
Oh, yeah.

01:28:31.848 --> 01:28:33.890
Now for the hard part.

01:28:35.601 --> 01:28:36.935
Let's try this.

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.563
Call light button.

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:41.523
I bypassed the buzzer.

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:43.567
Let's hope she sees it.

01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:47.070
Wait. What makes you think
you can trust her?

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.532
When I was in the elevator...

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:52.909
she saw me when Hassan walked in.

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:54.703
- Oh, great.
- Wait.

01:28:54.912 --> 01:28:57.497
She was cool, she covered me.
She'll do this.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.627
I just hope you have better luck
with women than I do.

01:29:17.935 --> 01:29:19.811
Come on, pick it up.

01:29:21.939 --> 01:29:23.899
Pick it up.

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:35.160
I'm watching you on video. Behind you...

01:29:35.328 --> 01:29:36.912
above the bulkhead.

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:41.833
There you go.

01:29:42.001 --> 01:29:43.960
We met in the elevator.

01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:48.256
American soldiers are on board,
ready to take over the plane.

01:29:48.466 --> 01:29:52.177
But there's a bomb,
and a passenger is in control of it.

01:29:52.595 --> 01:29:54.679
We need your help to find him.

01:29:55.348 --> 01:29:58.475
You're looking for a man
with an electronic device.

01:29:58.684 --> 01:29:59.768
He's probably...

01:30:04.273 --> 01:30:06.775
Sorry. I thought the phone rang.

01:30:20.706 --> 01:30:22.332
Oh, no.

01:30:23.501 --> 01:30:25.502
Jesus.

01:30:37.557 --> 01:30:39.015
Get on with it.

01:30:47.859 --> 01:30:49.776
Come on, hang in there.

01:30:50.736 --> 01:30:51.820
Hang in there.

01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:56.992
She's had it. Forget it.

01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:14.217
Look.

01:31:14.385 --> 01:31:16.178
She's shaking. She's not going to do it.

01:31:16.637 --> 01:31:17.804
Wait a minute.

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:28.398
Lady's a player. She's with us.

01:31:29.066 --> 01:31:31.568
Okay. Get in position.

01:31:31.819 --> 01:31:36.740
Get upstairs. If she fingers somebody,
we must move fast.

01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:50.587
They're here.

01:32:07.772 --> 01:32:12.776
Oceanic Flight 343, approximately
120 miles from fail-safe line.

01:32:12.985 --> 01:32:16.321
I've spoken to the president. He concurs.

01:32:19.283 --> 01:32:22.994
If we can't make them divert,
we have no other option.

01:32:23.454 --> 01:32:28.291
The F-14's should intercept
in approximately 15 minutes.

01:32:29.168 --> 01:32:32.087
We're not going to
shoot this plane down, are we?

01:32:32.296 --> 01:32:35.674
Whatever evidence there is
will go to the bottom of the ocean.

01:32:36.008 --> 01:32:39.177
The president would be finished.
He'd never recover.

01:32:40.513 --> 01:32:42.180
Four hundred American lives.

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:45.475
We'd all be finished,
the whole administration.

01:32:55.987 --> 01:32:59.823
Miss, may I have some water
for my medication?

01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:00.991
My pleasure.

01:33:01.158 --> 01:33:02.659
- Oh, dear.
- I'll get it for you.

01:33:09.333 --> 01:33:10.333
What are you doing?

01:33:10.501 --> 01:33:12.794
I was just getting her medication.

01:33:18.217 --> 01:33:20.093
Can I go get her some water?

01:33:21.345 --> 01:33:22.345
Go!

01:33:23.889 --> 01:33:25.181
Thank you. Thank you.

01:33:44.243 --> 01:33:46.703
That's it. You got something, don't you?

01:33:56.339 --> 01:33:58.131
Not long enough. "One" something.

01:33:58.299 --> 01:34:00.508
- Did you get it?
- No, it was too quick.

01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:03.261
She'll give it to us again. She must.

01:34:11.604 --> 01:34:13.063
Here she comes.

01:34:15.775 --> 01:34:17.400
- "Two one"...
- "K."

01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:18.652
Twenty-one K.

01:34:24.867 --> 01:34:26.242
Slap Flight, this is Lead.

01:34:26.702 --> 01:34:31.581
Contact 0-3-9 at 125.
Come left 0-1-5 for collision.

01:34:31.749 --> 01:34:34.250
Three's contact and concur. Angel's 44.

01:34:38.798 --> 01:34:40.048
- Rat.
- Go ahead.

01:34:40.216 --> 01:34:41.257
She found something.

01:34:41.467 --> 01:34:43.009
Twenty-one K.

01:34:43.219 --> 01:34:44.636
- Midsection...
- Midsection.

01:34:44.804 --> 01:34:47.347
- Starboard side. Window seat.
- Starboard side. Window seat.

01:34:47.723 --> 01:34:49.766
Roger, I'm on my way.

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:07.409
I can't do it.

01:35:10.287 --> 01:35:11.579
I can't...

01:35:11.789 --> 01:35:12.831
breathe.

01:35:13.207 --> 01:35:15.583
Okay, Cahill. Just relax.

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:17.460
I'm right here.

01:35:21.048 --> 01:35:23.299
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

01:35:23.843 --> 01:35:25.969
Just close your eyes.

01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:32.392
Breathe deep.

01:35:37.523 --> 01:35:38.982
Now...

01:35:39.608 --> 01:35:42.861
Open your eyes and cut the blue wire.

01:35:54.999 --> 01:35:56.249
Oh...

01:36:09.847 --> 01:36:15.477
It's a decoy. It's a fake. The real works
must be down below under the plate.

01:36:15.853 --> 01:36:18.188
What the hell happened?
What is going on?

01:36:18.397 --> 01:36:19.522
I'm sorry.

01:36:19.857 --> 01:36:23.359
It's just, the whole goddamn thing
could just blow up!

01:36:23.527 --> 01:36:24.736
Speak English.

01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:26.529
I screwed up.

01:36:29.658 --> 01:36:31.534
We have to start over.

01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:42.670
Grant, I'm there.

01:36:42.838 --> 01:36:44.631
If it's Demou, he's about 50...

01:36:44.799 --> 01:36:46.633
olive skin, dark hair, balding.

01:36:49.553 --> 01:36:52.263
It could be. I can't see him clearly.

01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:54.766
I can't get a clean shot. Louie?

01:36:55.392 --> 01:36:56.768
His back is to me.

01:36:57.603 --> 01:36:59.479
But he fits the description.

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:02.273
Demou. It has to be.

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:03.900
Can you take him?

01:37:04.068 --> 01:37:05.235
Not a chance.

01:37:05.402 --> 01:37:07.821
There's passengers all around him.

01:37:13.369 --> 01:37:15.745
- Where'd they come from?
- I don't know.

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:20.792
Nagi, fighter planes.

01:37:21.126 --> 01:37:24.128
Slap, Strike One Tally Ho.
Assuming position for escort.

01:37:40.145 --> 01:37:44.357
Oceanic Flight 343,
this is flight leader, U.S. Navy aircraft.

01:37:44.775 --> 01:37:47.110
You are approaching U.S. Airspace.

01:37:47.486 --> 01:37:50.196
You are to divert heading 0-2-0.

01:37:50.739 --> 01:37:52.991
Fix vector for Thule Air Force Base.

01:37:53.242 --> 01:37:56.119
Divert. Steer 0-2-0.

01:37:56.328 --> 01:37:59.163
Squawk 7500 to acknowledge.

01:37:59.665 --> 01:38:04.460
Oceanic Flight 343, this is
flight leader, U.S. Navy aircraft.

01:38:05.754 --> 01:38:07.964
Son of a bitch.

01:38:09.049 --> 01:38:11.551
Divert to Thule Air Force Base.

01:38:11.844 --> 01:38:13.219
0-2-0.

01:38:13.929 --> 01:38:16.139
Navy jets ordering us to divert.

01:38:16.348 --> 01:38:19.142
- We must be close to fail-safe.
- We've had it.

01:38:19.393 --> 01:38:20.518
They'll shoot us down.

01:38:20.686 --> 01:38:23.229
No, no. We've got to
signal them somehow.

01:38:23.439 --> 01:38:25.148
Got to be a way.

01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:27.275
Come on, think. Think.

01:38:27.484 --> 01:38:30.486
Vector 0-2-0. Thule Air Force Base.
Acknowledge.

01:38:30.821 --> 01:38:34.657
Oceanic Flight 343. On guard. Turn right.

01:38:36.619 --> 01:38:38.161
Got to do something.

01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:41.039
Look out your left window.

01:38:41.415 --> 01:38:44.250
This is U.S. Navy flight lead.

01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:46.544
Show me a sign you understand.

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:49.339
What the hell are they doing?

01:38:49.506 --> 01:38:50.840
Getting ready to light us up.

01:38:55.054 --> 01:38:56.137
All right.

01:38:56.305 --> 01:38:58.139
- Take that left clip.
- I got it.

01:39:00.184 --> 01:39:02.685
- Okay. I got it.
- That's 77.

01:39:02.853 --> 01:39:06.356
Flight 343. It is imperative
that you acknowledge.

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:08.942
Divert now. Steer 0-2-0.

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:12.028
- This is U.S. Navy flight lead.
- Hey. We must respond.

01:39:12.237 --> 01:39:14.197
You say nothing. Stay on course.

01:39:19.536 --> 01:39:21.120
Now.

01:39:35.386 --> 01:39:36.427
It looks clear.

01:39:37.054 --> 01:39:41.557
We need something non-metallic
to slip between those points.

01:39:47.690 --> 01:39:48.731
Cahill.

01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:01.953
Grant. I think we've got it licked,
but we need a few more minutes.

01:40:02.162 --> 01:40:03.663
Great. Stay at it.

01:40:04.081 --> 01:40:06.708
All right, listen. Pin 77's over here.

01:40:06.917 --> 01:40:10.461
Slap Flight, this is Lead.
I'm going to pull out in front.

01:40:21.348 --> 01:40:22.724
Okay.

01:40:22.891 --> 01:40:24.100
What are we missing?

01:40:24.435 --> 01:40:26.102
I'm thinking the same thing.

01:40:27.312 --> 01:40:28.813
The sphere is cold.

01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:33.359
In my green bag,
there's a can of compressed air.

01:40:33.902 --> 01:40:35.028
Give it a shot.

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:50.626
Shit.

01:40:51.754 --> 01:40:53.254
Cahill?

01:40:54.298 --> 01:40:55.631
Cahill.

01:40:56.633 --> 01:41:00.053
In my kit, infrared goggles.

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.938
Jesus Christ.

01:41:12.066 --> 01:41:13.483
We're finished.

01:41:14.526 --> 01:41:16.861
One more time. Oceanic Flight 343.

01:41:17.237 --> 01:41:19.864
Come right 0-2-0. Thule Air Force Base.

01:41:20.282 --> 01:41:21.491
Give me Washington.

01:41:21.658 --> 01:41:23.868
It is very important
that you follow me, sir.

01:41:24.036 --> 01:41:27.080
You must follow me.
Captain, please acknowledge.

01:41:27.289 --> 01:41:28.790
This is Al Tha'r.

01:41:28.957 --> 01:41:30.166
Why are we being threatened?

01:41:30.334 --> 01:41:33.377
I said my terms are
absolute. The hostages will be released...

01:41:33.545 --> 01:41:35.880
when we land in Washington.

01:41:36.173 --> 01:41:37.423
No compromises.

01:41:37.674 --> 01:41:41.302
This is Secretary of Defense
Charles White.

01:41:41.553 --> 01:41:43.888
You must listen to me. We know...

01:41:44.098 --> 01:41:45.765
You know nothing!

01:41:46.433 --> 01:41:47.975
Tell your president...

01:41:48.143 --> 01:41:51.771
he will comply or suffer
the blood of Americans on board.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.819
It's time, senator.

01:41:58.737 --> 01:42:00.279
Hello?

01:42:02.199 --> 01:42:04.700
Hello? Are you there?
Can you hear me?

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:06.702
Hello?

01:42:08.288 --> 01:42:10.581
- Hello, can you hear me?
- Yes.

01:42:10.749 --> 01:42:14.710
This is Senator Mavros.
I'd like to speak to the president.

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:17.630
Senator, the president
is out of the country.

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:19.423
I'm speaking on his behalf.

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:21.884
I don't care. I want to speak to him now.

01:42:23.262 --> 01:42:24.637
Senator, I'm in charge of the crisis team.

01:42:24.805 --> 01:42:26.806
No. Oh, no.

01:42:26.974 --> 01:42:29.100
They have a gun to my head.

01:42:29.309 --> 01:42:31.435
Please, just do what they want!

01:42:32.729 --> 01:42:33.771
Please!

01:42:36.525 --> 01:42:37.942
What was that?

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:43.364
What happened?

01:42:44.241 --> 01:42:46.159
Jesus Christ.

01:42:46.869 --> 01:42:48.077
This is the pilot.

01:42:48.245 --> 01:42:52.582
They killed the senator. Do what they ask.

01:42:52.749 --> 01:42:55.001
He killed Mavros.

01:42:55.627 --> 01:42:57.920
Whatever you're going to do, do it now.

01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:04.760
Listen to me.

01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:07.180
The plane will continue on as planned.

01:43:07.431 --> 01:43:12.018
Any further threats will result in
a passenger being killed every minute.

01:43:13.103 --> 01:43:16.355
They're only 25 miles
to the fail-safe line.

01:43:25.574 --> 01:43:27.200
We have to end this now.

01:43:49.806 --> 01:43:54.143
Nav. Com. Flash on
the CRN-115. National Command Authority.

01:43:54.519 --> 01:43:56.312
We're ordered to destroy the target.

01:43:56.855 --> 01:43:58.314
You're joking.

01:43:58.482 --> 01:44:01.067
I confirmed it twice. It's for real.

01:44:02.402 --> 01:44:04.987
Slap Two, Three and Four,
take high cover.

01:44:05.239 --> 01:44:07.073
Follow on a one-mile trail.

01:44:07.282 --> 01:44:08.574
Sparrow select.

01:44:19.836 --> 01:44:22.505
Strike Slap One, stand by
for Fox One from Lead.

01:44:23.423 --> 01:44:25.258
I'm going master arm on.

01:44:31.473 --> 01:44:32.723
Do it.

01:44:36.812 --> 01:44:40.523
Slap Flight, this is Lead.
We have full lock on the heavy.

01:44:57.749 --> 01:45:00.501
Negative! Go cold on the sparrow!

01:45:02.796 --> 01:45:04.547
The taillights are flashing.

01:45:05.966 --> 01:45:08.259
Hope I'm not going too fast.

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:10.636
Nobody uses Morse code now.

01:45:10.887 --> 01:45:12.013
Except navy pilots.

01:45:12.472 --> 01:45:13.889
Keep sending it.

01:45:14.308 --> 01:45:15.474
Is that what I think?

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:17.310
You're damn right.

01:45:20.063 --> 01:45:21.314
This is Slap One.

01:45:21.523 --> 01:45:24.233
We have visual communication
from the target.

01:45:24.443 --> 01:45:27.361
Seems to be Morse code coming
from the nav lights.

01:45:28.113 --> 01:45:30.072
According to my supplement...

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:33.034
the message appears
to be, "Hail Mary..."

01:45:33.243 --> 01:45:35.119
Alpha One...

01:45:35.329 --> 01:45:37.204
"...10 minutes."

01:45:37.539 --> 01:45:40.374
- Message repeats.
- Alpha One's the attack code.

01:45:41.418 --> 01:45:43.586
You mean they made it?
They're on board?

01:45:43.754 --> 01:45:45.171
They'll try to take her.

01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:47.923
It's too late. They've crossed the line.

01:45:48.216 --> 01:45:52.303
If they're on board,
we'll give them another 10 minutes.

01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:55.765
Admiral Lewis.

01:46:00.270 --> 01:46:01.437
Flight 343...

01:46:01.813 --> 01:46:04.774
this is Navy flight leader
Victor-Victor-Five.

01:46:04.941 --> 01:46:08.944
Flight 343, this is
Navy flight leader Victor-Victor-Five.

01:46:09.237 --> 01:46:11.947
Alpha One, you have 10 minutes
to U.S. Airspace.

01:46:12.282 --> 01:46:13.824
Repeat. Alpha One...

01:46:14.034 --> 01:46:16.118
10 minutes to U.S. Airspace.

01:46:16.912 --> 01:46:21.791
You have permission to land
at Dulles Airport. Good luck, sir.

01:46:22.125 --> 01:46:23.334
They got it.

01:46:24.586 --> 01:46:26.128
- They got it?
- They got it.

01:46:27.255 --> 01:46:31.258
I should take back every
squid-hating thing I ever said.

01:46:36.765 --> 01:46:38.349
Monitor the radio.

01:46:38.642 --> 01:46:40.309
And no contact.

01:46:42.145 --> 01:46:44.105
Rat. We got a break.

01:46:44.648 --> 01:46:45.940
We have 10 minutes.

01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:48.150
We'll take the sleeper first.

01:46:48.485 --> 01:46:52.071
It must be by surprise.
Cappy's almost there on the bomb.

01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:53.489
Wait a few minutes.

01:46:53.865 --> 01:46:54.949
We're out of time.

01:46:55.158 --> 01:46:57.576
We go, blow out the lights,
take our chances.

01:46:57.786 --> 01:46:58.869
Five minutes, Rat.

01:46:59.287 --> 01:47:01.330
They'll have the bomb diffused by then.

01:47:01.498 --> 01:47:03.332
Now give it five minutes.

01:47:06.711 --> 01:47:09.171
Rat. Give him five minutes.

01:47:09.673 --> 01:47:10.840
Rat.

01:47:11.007 --> 01:47:12.258
I agree.

01:47:14.719 --> 01:47:16.178
All right, Grant...

01:47:16.596 --> 01:47:18.055
five minutes.

01:47:18.598 --> 01:47:21.308
Baker, get into position. Louie, stand by.

01:47:36.658 --> 01:47:37.867
All right, Cappy.

01:47:38.034 --> 01:47:39.869
We have five minutes. How you doing?

01:47:40.162 --> 01:47:41.871
Where were you?

01:47:42.497 --> 01:47:45.541
The sphere is filled
with photoelectric beams.

01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:47.460
We need more than five minutes.

01:47:49.212 --> 01:47:50.463
Grant.

01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:52.548
Grant, come in.

01:47:52.716 --> 01:47:54.717
Just do the best you can.

01:47:57.762 --> 01:47:59.430
Five minutes.

01:48:38.428 --> 01:48:39.720
Pick it up.

01:48:47.771 --> 01:48:50.814
Jan, you've been fantastic.

01:48:51.942 --> 01:48:54.443
But I need your help one more time.

01:48:54.819 --> 01:48:56.278
Lower galley.

01:48:56.947 --> 01:49:00.282
Turn around.
Get in the elevator right now. Go.

01:49:01.243 --> 01:49:02.618
Okay.

01:49:24.307 --> 01:49:26.141
They'll start descending soon.

01:49:26.351 --> 01:49:28.310
I know, Jack.

01:49:30.605 --> 01:49:35.192
MAN Radar confirmation.
Oceanic Flight 343 now at 25-mile limit.

01:49:46.329 --> 01:49:47.580
Keep going.

01:49:51.626 --> 01:49:53.168
I'll blow the lights.

01:49:53.336 --> 01:49:55.671
Two more minutes and then we go.

01:49:55.964 --> 01:49:57.548
Grant, how are you?

01:49:59.968 --> 01:50:02.511
Grant? Grant?

01:50:16.401 --> 01:50:17.651
It's okay.

01:50:33.543 --> 01:50:35.336
Just keep walking.

01:50:39.633 --> 01:50:41.050
It's Grant.

01:50:41.384 --> 01:50:43.927
- He's down below in mid-cabin.
- What?

01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:45.971
When I push you down...

01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:48.349
hit the floor and stay down.

01:50:49.142 --> 01:50:52.394
- He's going for the sleeper.
- That son of a bitch.

01:50:55.315 --> 01:50:57.441
We go on your signal.

01:51:00.862 --> 01:51:02.279
Go.

01:51:09.996 --> 01:51:11.246
Something's wrong.

01:51:13.166 --> 01:51:14.208
It's not him.

01:51:23.218 --> 01:51:24.927
Everybody down!

01:51:27.847 --> 01:51:28.931
Behind you!

01:51:38.066 --> 01:51:39.775
He's got Demou. Blow the lights.

01:52:11.266 --> 01:52:12.474
Louie!

01:52:12.767 --> 01:52:14.143
The sleeper!

01:53:40.230 --> 01:53:44.024
Cahill! The straw! The straw!

01:54:07.632 --> 01:54:09.091
Cahill!

01:54:09.259 --> 01:54:11.093
I can't hold it!

01:54:33.157 --> 01:54:34.783
Come in, Dulles.

01:54:35.952 --> 01:54:39.246
Dulles, this is Oceanic 343 heavy...

01:54:39.455 --> 01:54:41.373
requesting emergency landing.

01:54:41.583 --> 01:54:44.334
We are low on fuel.
We have structural damage...

01:54:44.544 --> 01:54:46.962
but we are stable and in control.

01:54:47.297 --> 01:54:48.589
This is Dulles.

01:54:48.798 --> 01:54:50.132
You are cleared to land.

01:54:50.508 --> 01:54:52.843
1-L north. Crash crew standing by.

01:54:53.553 --> 01:54:54.678
Thank God.

01:54:54.888 --> 01:54:56.305
They're in control.

01:55:23.458 --> 01:55:26.001
The bomb! What about the bomb?

01:55:27.003 --> 01:55:28.587
Listen to this.

01:55:29.756 --> 01:55:31.131
It's done!

01:55:35.845 --> 01:55:37.387
Jesus.

01:55:37.931 --> 01:55:40.557
It's done! You got anything else for us?

01:55:40.767 --> 01:55:42.726
Got to tell Washington.

01:55:44.354 --> 01:55:45.729
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:56:03.998 --> 01:56:05.207
It's over.

01:56:06.542 --> 01:56:07.876
Over?

01:56:09.170 --> 01:56:11.046
It's not over.

01:56:14.884 --> 01:56:16.218
It's over.

01:56:18.262 --> 01:56:19.554
Who are you?

01:56:21.891 --> 01:56:23.767
No one.

01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:28.438
You're very clever.

01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:30.691
But you're too late.

01:56:31.067 --> 01:56:32.859
You've stopped nothing.

01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:32.502
Dulles International...

01:57:32.754 --> 01:57:33.795
this is Flight 343.

01:57:33.963 --> 01:57:36.673
The airplane is secure,
but the pilots are dead. Request help.

01:57:36.966 --> 01:57:39.009
Flight 343, you're breaking up.

01:57:39.218 --> 01:57:43.972
We don't read you. You're cleared
to land on runway 1-L north.

01:57:44.182 --> 01:57:45.724
I need help. I need instruction.

01:57:46.309 --> 01:57:48.435
There's a bomb
that could detonate on impact.

01:57:48.853 --> 01:57:50.145
You're breaking up.

01:57:50.396 --> 01:57:51.480
They're not receiving.

01:57:51.689 --> 01:57:52.773
Shit!

01:57:53.816 --> 01:57:56.777
Get ahold of it now.
Get ahold of this plane.

01:57:59.989 --> 01:58:01.907
It's all right. It'll be okay.

01:58:04.660 --> 01:58:06.703
All right, stick and rudder.

01:58:06.954 --> 01:58:08.872
Stick and rudder. It's an airplane.

01:58:09.207 --> 01:58:11.333
Straight and level. Hold it.

01:58:14.670 --> 01:58:16.296
Oh, my God.

01:58:18.674 --> 01:58:20.383
Are you a pilot?

01:58:20.885 --> 01:58:22.469
You got to help me.

01:58:22.678 --> 01:58:25.722
I've had a few lessons,
but I've never really soloed.

01:58:26.432 --> 01:58:27.682
Okay. All right.

01:58:27.850 --> 01:58:29.684
We're probably lined up for landing.

01:58:29.894 --> 01:58:31.937
There it is! There's the airport.

01:58:32.146 --> 01:58:33.563
There, see it?

01:58:33.773 --> 01:58:35.732
Okay, I got it. I got it. All right.

01:58:36.442 --> 01:58:39.986
Pilot's Operating Handbook.
That's what I need. Over there.

01:58:40.363 --> 01:58:42.197
I don't see it. What's it look like?

01:58:42.365 --> 01:58:43.782
It'll say, "Flight Manual."

01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:45.700
Back there! In the back.

01:58:46.702 --> 01:58:49.704
Okay, I got it, I got it. Flight manual.

01:58:50.331 --> 01:58:53.500
- What do I look for?
- The normal procedures.

01:58:53.709 --> 01:58:55.210
Landing approach speeds.

01:58:55.837 --> 01:58:57.337
Okay, here it is. I got it.

01:58:57.713 --> 01:58:58.880
What's it say?

01:58:59.090 --> 01:59:01.758
Final approach speeds...

01:59:01.926 --> 01:59:04.052
"...over 600,000 pounds, 150 knots...

01:59:04.262 --> 01:59:06.555
under 400,000 pounds, 120 knots."

01:59:06.973 --> 01:59:08.640
Split it. 140 knots.

01:59:09.016 --> 01:59:10.392
We're doing 220 knots.

01:59:11.394 --> 01:59:12.561
Reduce power.

01:59:12.770 --> 01:59:14.396
Nose down.

01:59:19.485 --> 01:59:21.069
170 knots.

01:59:22.947 --> 01:59:24.656
It's getting loose.

01:59:27.076 --> 01:59:28.952
I'm losing control of the airplane.

01:59:30.913 --> 01:59:32.038
What's wrong?

01:59:33.124 --> 01:59:34.166
Flaps!

01:59:35.084 --> 01:59:37.169
How much flaps can I put on?

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:42.966
Flaps, flaps, flaps. 170 knots...
any amount of flaps you want.

01:59:45.511 --> 01:59:46.678
Goddamn it!

01:59:51.017 --> 01:59:52.267
Two, three, four.

01:59:55.521 --> 01:59:57.314
There. 160.

01:59:57.523 --> 01:59:58.815
There we go. 150.

01:59:59.192 --> 02:00:00.442
140.

02:00:00.651 --> 02:00:01.693
130.

02:00:05.489 --> 02:00:07.699
What the hell? I'm going to stall!

02:00:10.828 --> 02:00:11.953
I'm stalling!

02:00:14.457 --> 02:00:15.832
Power! Power up!

02:00:19.503 --> 02:00:20.629
140.

02:00:21.797 --> 02:00:23.798
One hundred and fifty knots.
There we go.

02:00:28.304 --> 02:00:31.765
Wait a minute.

02:00:34.143 --> 02:00:35.644
Landing gear.

02:00:38.648 --> 02:00:39.981
Okay.

02:00:50.952 --> 02:00:52.369
Okay, we're going to land.

02:01:05.424 --> 02:01:06.841
Oh, man. We're long.

02:01:08.135 --> 02:01:09.177
What the hell?

02:01:09.428 --> 02:01:10.804
He's way too high.

02:01:12.932 --> 02:01:13.974
Come on!

02:01:14.141 --> 02:01:15.600
I missed. I missed it.

02:01:16.644 --> 02:01:18.103
I missed it. I'm over.

02:01:19.522 --> 02:01:21.523
Power up.

02:01:23.276 --> 02:01:24.859
Won't climb.

02:01:25.111 --> 02:01:27.237
Come on, baby. Come on.

02:01:36.622 --> 02:01:38.123
Gear up!

02:01:39.875 --> 02:01:42.335
All right. All right.

02:01:42.795 --> 02:01:44.045
Now what do I do?

02:01:44.797 --> 02:01:46.548
Turn around for another approach.

02:01:46.757 --> 02:01:48.133
I can't turn it around.

02:01:48.551 --> 02:01:49.551
Yes, you can.

02:01:49.885 --> 02:01:51.720
No, wait. Wait a minute.

02:01:51.929 --> 02:01:53.096
Let me think.

02:01:53.472 --> 02:01:54.806
Hold it.

02:01:55.016 --> 02:01:56.516
That's the interstate.

02:01:57.059 --> 02:02:00.228
There's the ballpark.
Frederick Field must be ahead.

02:02:00.438 --> 02:02:02.105
I know where I am.

02:02:02.315 --> 02:02:04.316
I can do this. All right.

02:02:04.817 --> 02:02:07.110
Line it up for 2-6.

02:02:08.487 --> 02:02:10.864
There it is. There it is!

02:02:11.824 --> 02:02:13.616
Reduce power.

02:02:18.956 --> 02:02:20.081
All right.

02:02:20.249 --> 02:02:21.416
Here we go.

02:02:21.584 --> 02:02:22.876
Power back.

02:02:24.462 --> 02:02:26.421
Shit. Landing gear...

02:02:27.923 --> 02:02:29.382
down.

02:02:30.593 --> 02:02:31.926
Airspeed...

02:02:32.094 --> 02:02:33.845
140 knots.

02:02:34.263 --> 02:02:36.514
All right. Think.

02:02:36.724 --> 02:02:37.932
What am I forgetting?

02:02:38.100 --> 02:02:40.101
Who cares? Just fly the plane!

02:02:42.396 --> 02:02:44.022
You're right.

02:02:44.398 --> 02:02:45.899
All right, I can do this.

02:02:46.525 --> 02:02:48.026
Okay.

02:02:48.319 --> 02:02:50.278
"Fly the plane."

02:02:51.572 --> 02:02:55.075
I can do this.

02:03:22.812 --> 02:03:23.978
Jesus, I'm down!

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:50.004
Shit. Hold on.

02:05:14.757 --> 02:05:17.383
Things almost land themselves,
don't they?

02:05:29.813 --> 02:05:30.855
Bye-bye.

02:05:32.358 --> 02:05:34.901
- Bye-bye. Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

02:05:35.069 --> 02:05:37.028
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you, dear.

02:05:44.578 --> 02:05:46.037
Cahill.

02:05:46.789 --> 02:05:49.249
I don't know how you did it,
but you did it.

02:05:49.416 --> 02:05:51.793
No, you did it.

02:05:55.339 --> 02:05:56.965
What do you mean? What is this?

02:05:57.132 --> 02:05:58.299
A little memento for you.

02:05:58.509 --> 02:06:01.302
I'll tell you about it another time.
Right now...

02:06:01.512 --> 02:06:04.472
I need a drink. A big drink.

02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:12.480
Marshal?

02:06:12.731 --> 02:06:13.856
How you doing?

02:06:14.066 --> 02:06:16.693
Getting better by the minute.

02:06:16.986 --> 02:06:19.112
Where'd these commandos come from?

02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:21.489
Good question.

02:06:28.497 --> 02:06:29.664
Take him up.

02:06:29.832 --> 02:06:31.249
You'll be okay.

02:06:31.458 --> 02:06:32.959
Hold it.

02:06:34.795 --> 02:06:36.004
Hey, guys.

02:07:10.497 --> 02:07:11.748
It's Jean.

02:07:12.499 --> 02:07:13.875
Hi.

02:07:14.043 --> 02:07:15.168
What?

02:07:15.377 --> 02:07:17.879
You called me Jan on the plane.
My name is Jean.

02:07:18.589 --> 02:07:19.881
Oh.

02:07:20.382 --> 02:07:22.050
Who are you?

02:07:22.384 --> 02:07:23.718
Dr. Grant...

02:07:23.969 --> 02:07:26.804
Agent Perry, FBI.
You're wanted at the Pentagon.

02:07:28.098 --> 02:07:29.682
Sorry I asked.

02:07:29.892 --> 02:07:31.976
Jean, wait.

02:07:33.771 --> 02:07:35.396
Can I buy you some coffee?

02:07:41.070 --> 02:07:42.820
As long as you're not flying.

02:07:44.281 --> 02:07:45.406
No problem.

02:08:01.298 --> 02:08:03.383
So, Jean, tell me something...

02:08:04.009 --> 02:08:05.093
Do you like hockey?

02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:08.429
Hockey? No, I only like baseball.

02:08:09.305 --> 02:08:15.481
