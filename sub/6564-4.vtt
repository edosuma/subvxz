Hey, CeCe, aren't you excited

00:14.060 --> 00:17.020
about us both being hideous
witches for Halloween?

00:17.050 --> 00:20.420
Yeah!
Wait until you see my costume!

00:25.160 --> 00:26.930
Wow. It's like
looking in a mirror.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.270
Yeah.

00:28.300 --> 00:29.400
You're not a witch.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.240
Yes, I am.

00:31.280 --> 00:36.080
I'm just a witch with a
very good sense of style.

00:36.120 --> 00:40.460
Look, here's my tiny witch hat
and here's my tiny broom.

00:41.990 --> 00:43.460
Well, thanks for the tiny effort.

00:46.030 --> 00:50.070
Oh, come on, it's the first time <i>Shake It Up, Chicago!
</i> <i>is hosting a Halloween party.</i>

00:50.100 --> 00:53.300
And I don't wanna be showing up
looking like some green weirdo.

00:56.340 --> 00:59.980
Not that it doesn't look great on you!

01:00.010 --> 01:01.140
I don't care if I look like a weirdo,

01:01.180 --> 01:03.010
because costume or no costume,

01:03.050 --> 01:05.310
everybody has something weird about them.

01:05.349 --> 01:07.120
Not me.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.390
Oh, really?

01:12.090 --> 01:13.130
See? Weird.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.200
Hi, Henry.
Bye, Henry.

01:22.440 --> 01:25.210
Henry, we're going trick-or-treating.
Where's your costume?

01:25.240 --> 01:26.970
I am wearing it.

01:27.010 --> 01:31.180
For your information, I am Nobel
Prize-winning physicist Niels Bohr.

01:34.450 --> 01:36.980
And now you're a ghost.

01:39.450 --> 01:42.990
And by the way, I'm not very impressed
with your costume, either.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.260
It's not a costume.

01:44.290 --> 01:47.360
It's the latest in candy
gathering technology.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.300
Watch.

01:49.330 --> 01:52.270
Arr! I'm a Viking!
Give me candy!

01:53.300 --> 01:55.440
Now...

01:55.470 --> 01:58.040
Oh, I'm a T-Rex!

01:58.080 --> 02:01.080
Oh, I'm going to eat your candy!
Squawk!

02:02.180 --> 02:04.020
Or...

02:06.950 --> 02:08.990
I could be a princess.

02:10.220 --> 02:12.160
It's great!

02:12.190 --> 02:15.300
I'll be able to hit up the same
people for candy over and over again.

02:15.330 --> 02:18.070
Yes, the true meaning of Halloween.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.170
Swindling your hardworking neighbors.

My green lady,

03:22.200 --> 03:24.940
talking to you has beeneth captivating.

03:24.970 --> 03:27.310
Oh! Thank you.
You can call me Rocky.

03:27.340 --> 03:30.140
And I, D'Artagnan.

03:31.310 --> 03:34.150
Now, alloweth me a recycled paper goblet

03:34.180 --> 03:36.020
of organic fruit punch.

03:38.020 --> 03:41.360
Ooh! Me thinks
someone likes you!

03:42.260 --> 03:44.330
I know it!

03:44.360 --> 03:47.000
And guess what?
He's got a really cool brother. Ally.

03:47.030 --> 03:49.230
Ooh! Really?
Which one is he?

03:49.270 --> 03:50.370
The one in the hunchback costume.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.340
What did I ever do to you?

03:56.370 --> 03:58.170
Come on!
Just talk to the guy.

03:58.210 --> 04:00.270
Forget what he looks like.
It's what's on the inside...

04:00.310 --> 04:02.140
Yeah, yep, uh-huh.

04:05.150 --> 04:07.180
Hey, hideous!
How you doing?

04:09.120 --> 04:10.150
Happy now?

04:10.190 --> 04:11.390
Very.

04:11.420 --> 04:13.320
Oh! Hey, look.
Instant Noodles is about to perform.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.420

Thanks, Mr. Dillon!
You can pick up Henry in an hour!

05:28.400 --> 05:31.100
One quick stop before we go inside.

05:32.300 --> 05:33.340
Oh!

05:35.040 --> 05:38.110
I saved the best for last.

05:38.140 --> 05:40.180
Mrs. Kaplan never
buys enough candy,

05:40.210 --> 05:44.080
so by the end of the night,
she gives out money!

05:50.190 --> 05:51.390
Trick or treat!

05:53.260 --> 05:55.020
You're not Mrs. Kaplan.

05:55.060 --> 05:57.990
And you're not the pizza delivery guy.

05:58.030 --> 06:01.260
Life's filled with disappointment.

06:01.300 --> 06:06.900
Wait! Where's our candy?
Or, if it's too late, cash.

06:06.940 --> 06:09.100
I don't know.
I'm not from here.

06:09.140 --> 06:11.110
I'm just...

06:11.140 --> 06:13.070
Visiting.

06:15.110 --> 06:19.280
Here's a take-out menu
and a rug sample.

06:21.190 --> 06:25.220
Oh! Oh! I get the rug sample!
Yeah!

06:25.260 --> 06:27.990
Is it me, or is that kid really weird?

06:28.030 --> 06:30.290
I mean, didn't you catch those
weird eyes that never blinked?

06:30.330 --> 06:32.330
And that kind of
see-through skin?

06:32.360 --> 06:38.070
Well, maybe I would have if you
hadn't put a sheet over my head.

06:38.100 --> 06:42.170
You're acting ridiculous.
There's nothing strange about that kid.

06:42.210 --> 06:44.240
Oh!

06:44.280 --> 06:46.280
Yeah, I guess you're right.

06:58.160 --> 07:04.130
I beseech you, fair maidens.
We all must hang out on the good morrow.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.330
I don't have my calendar with me,

07:05.360 --> 07:08.970
but I'm pretty sure my
good morrow is booked.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.930
Excuse us.
Whoa!

07:12.300 --> 07:14.100
I know what you're doing.

07:14.140 --> 07:16.070
You don't wanna hang out with them
because you think they're weird.

07:16.110 --> 07:20.010
I don't think they're weird.
I know they're weird.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.980
Come on. You know I can't
hang out with boys alone.

07:24.020 --> 07:25.380
And I've done it for you.

07:25.420 --> 07:29.050
I mean, do I really have to remind
you about Baloney Breath Guy?

07:30.220 --> 07:31.420
Fine, I owe you.

07:34.090 --> 07:36.360
Okay, so maybe we can all go
to Crusty's Pizza tomorrow?

07:36.400 --> 07:40.100
Oh, fair Rocky, I cannot wait
to accompany you to a meal

07:40.130 --> 07:43.100
of leavened bread, tomato sauce and cheese.

07:44.170 --> 07:47.240
Great, now we're not even having pizza.

07:49.440 --> 07:53.410
Do you know why Halloween
candy is called "fun size"?

07:53.450 --> 07:58.050
Because "smaller than normal"
sounds disappointing?

07:58.080 --> 08:01.420
No, because it's really
fun to dump on the floor

08:01.460 --> 08:03.120
and make candy angels!

08:06.230 --> 08:07.930
Yay! Fun!

08:15.170 --> 08:18.170
Wow, I've never seen so
much candy in one place.

08:19.370 --> 08:23.240
That's 2,283 pieces.

08:24.140 --> 08:28.110
966 with nuts,

08:28.150 --> 08:30.280
312 with nougat.

08:33.950 --> 08:34.960
I'm guessing.

08:37.090 --> 08:39.190
You'd be really popular
from where I come from.

08:39.230 --> 08:40.230
Which is where?

08:41.130 --> 08:43.030
Jupiter.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.070
Jupiter, Florida?

08:47.100 --> 08:49.040
Okay.

08:52.210 --> 08:53.310
Coming, Mom!

09:00.020 --> 09:01.350
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

09:01.380 --> 09:04.420
That he would make a
formidable chess opponent?

09:05.090 --> 09:06.350
No!

09:06.390 --> 09:10.320
Then I have no idea where
you're going with this.

09:10.360 --> 09:15.360
Don't laugh, but do you think it's
possible that he might be an alien?

09:18.030 --> 09:20.940
Well, there are many schools
of thought on this subject,

09:20.970 --> 09:22.940
but the universe is limitless,

09:22.970 --> 09:27.410
so statistics would suggest there's a high
probability that alien life does exist.

09:28.950 --> 09:31.380
Ever heard of "yes" or "no"?

09:35.350 --> 09:37.320
You know what?

09:37.350 --> 09:40.160
I feel sick.
I think I have a temperature.

09:40.190 --> 09:41.260
Hold on.
Let me check your forehead.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.990
Ow!

09:44.030 --> 09:48.000
Okay, here's how it's going down.

09:48.030 --> 09:51.300
You are gonna give this guy a chance, okay?
A real chance.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.270
So, I'm setting my watch for three hours.

09:53.300 --> 09:58.270
Three hours?
But that's, like, forevz.

09:58.310 --> 10:01.040
No running away until you hear a beep.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.080
Beep!

10:03.310 --> 10:05.350
It was worth a shot.

10:05.380 --> 10:07.050
You're right.
It is.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.120
Ow!

10:12.090 --> 10:14.120
I'll get it, Mom!

10:19.430 --> 10:22.130
Hello, humanoid.

10:22.170 --> 10:24.200
I knew it!
You are an alien!

10:24.230 --> 10:27.340
Silence! I've come
to abduct you!

10:27.370 --> 10:29.070
You'll have to catch me first!

10:29.110 --> 10:31.370
Okay, you caught me.

10:33.280 --> 10:36.110
Prepare the transfer deck.
I have our captive.

10:36.150 --> 10:38.310
Hey, Flynn, I forgot to
give you back your...

10:38.350 --> 10:40.380
Zoiks!

10:40.420 --> 10:45.020
I don't know if I'm excited to be in the
presence of an actual alien life-form,

10:45.050 --> 10:48.390
or if I'm just upset that Flynn
figured it out before I did.

10:50.090 --> 10:51.430
Henry, run!

10:51.460 --> 10:55.230
I can't. I'm not wearing
adequate arch support.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.410
Sorry my spaceship is such a mess.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.380
My robot maid is in the shop.

11:08.180 --> 11:10.250
Holy moly!

11:10.280 --> 11:13.220
I can't believe I've been
abducted by an alien!

11:13.250 --> 11:15.950
It was inevitable I'd be taken.

11:15.990 --> 11:18.050
I bet they'll probe my brain.

11:18.090 --> 11:21.360
Flynn, you, they'll probably just eat.

11:26.230 --> 11:28.200
Hey, is this seat taken?

11:29.100 --> 11:31.070
Unfortunately, it is.

11:31.100 --> 11:34.000
I met some whack-a-doo
at a party last night.

11:34.040 --> 11:37.240
Now I have to sit through a pizza with him.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.180
Yeah, I'm the
whack-a-doo. Paul.

11:41.350 --> 11:44.050
Oh! Well,
in that case, hi,

11:44.080 --> 11:46.150
I've been so looking forward to this.
Be right back.

11:47.390 --> 11:49.990
Rocky, look.
It's Paul from last night.

11:50.020 --> 11:53.490
Now that he doesn't have his
costume on, he is totally cute!

11:55.060 --> 11:58.030
I mean, on the inside.

12:00.270 --> 12:01.430
Oh, hey, D'Artagnan.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.240
Hello, m'lady.

12:06.970 --> 12:09.280
Thou musteth excuse us for our tardiness.

12:09.310 --> 12:12.110
We were stuck on the
gas-powered motor carriage.

12:12.150 --> 12:13.310
Also known as the bus.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.280
Um, are you going to another
costume party tonight, or...

12:17.320 --> 12:20.190
Nay, m'lady.
Why wouldst thou thinkest that?

12:20.220 --> 12:23.260
Oh, well, because you're
dressed in the same thing

12:23.290 --> 12:25.290
you were dressed in last night.

12:25.330 --> 12:29.330
Oh! 'Tis not so.
This is a different pair of pantaloons.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.460
Pants! Just
call them pants!

12:34.340 --> 12:37.070
All right, so let me
just get this straight.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.400
You dress like this all the time?

12:38.440 --> 12:41.440
Oh, nay.
When I joust, I wear armor.

12:43.340 --> 12:45.340
No worries.
Same father, different mother.

12:45.380 --> 12:47.480
Totally, completely different DNA.

12:49.670 --> 12:52.610
And I thought I didn't want to
sit through a pizza with them.

12:59.310 --> 13:01.410
Okay! Are we
ready to order?

13:01.440 --> 13:04.250
Hey, didn't you used to be a
waitress at the Olive Pit?

13:04.280 --> 13:06.110
Yeah, they had to shut that place down

13:06.150 --> 13:09.180
after somebody almost died from trying
to eat one of those giant meatballs.

13:11.150 --> 13:12.250
So what'll it be?

13:12.290 --> 13:15.360
Oh! We are gonna share a
Crusty's supreme pizza.

13:15.390 --> 13:18.090
Now, I did not see it on thine menu,

13:18.130 --> 13:21.230
but does this fine
establishment serveth mutton?

13:22.430 --> 13:24.300
You know, normally we do,

13:24.330 --> 13:29.400
but, unfortunately, our mutton
delivery guy is about 400 years late.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.340
Just give him the chicken wings
and tell him it's quail.

13:31.370 --> 13:33.410
That's what my dad does.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.110
Thank you, innkeep.

13:35.140 --> 13:38.380
Make haste and there's
a shilling in it for you.

13:38.410 --> 13:43.120
Wow! Thanks for the bus
token, Prince Cheapskate.

13:45.090 --> 13:47.260
CeCe, bathroom?

13:47.290 --> 13:49.190
Nope, I don't have to go to the bathroom.

13:49.230 --> 13:50.230
Yes, you do.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.060
Sorry.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.400
Okay, we're just gonna sneak out of here

13:54.430 --> 13:57.230
and pretend this never happened.
Come on!

13:57.270 --> 13:59.440
Why would we do that?

13:59.470 --> 14:03.070
Because, I mean, D'Artagnan
is still in his costume.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.270
I mean, he is so...

14:05.310 --> 14:07.440
You were going to say "weird," right?

14:07.480 --> 14:10.380
No.
No, I wasn't.

14:10.410 --> 14:13.450
Oh, good, because I
remember a certain someone

14:13.480 --> 14:17.250
going on and on about how you
should give a person three hours

14:17.290 --> 14:19.320
to really get to know them.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.120
Or did that just apply to me?

14:23.330 --> 14:26.060
No, it applies to me, too.

14:26.100 --> 14:29.230
But I didn't say three hours.
I said three minutes. Beep! Let's go.

14:29.260 --> 14:32.430
Oh, just admit I was right, you were wrong,

14:32.470 --> 14:35.440
and this medieval nightmare
comes to an end.

14:36.510 --> 14:39.310
You know what?
I do think he's weird.

14:39.340 --> 14:43.110
Weirdly awesome! Yeah!

14:43.150 --> 14:48.120
Oh, good, 'cause you still have two
hours and 53 minutes. Let's go.

14:48.150 --> 14:50.350
Oh, I'm sure time will just fly by.

14:53.220 --> 14:54.460
Oh, I got a text!

14:59.360 --> 15:01.360
Ah, it is from my mother.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.530
She is angry that I didn't tidy
up my bedchamber before I left.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.270
I must text her back.

15:06.300 --> 15:10.070
We are so going to separate colleges.

15:10.110 --> 15:14.080
Dearest Mother, I will take care of
it upon my return before nightfall.

15:14.110 --> 15:18.080
Exclamation point, smiley face.

15:18.120 --> 15:19.350
Tick-tock,
tick-tock.

15:19.390 --> 15:24.290
Stop it! I'm having
a great time.

15:24.320 --> 15:29.100
Um, D'Artagnan, your phone is
pooping in my cheesy bread.

15:32.230 --> 15:35.100
Ooh! What's
this machine do?

15:35.400 --> 15:37.200
Sequence my DNA?

15:37.240 --> 15:39.400
Close. It's our dishwasher.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.340
And you're annoying.

15:42.380 --> 15:45.110
One more word, you're going back home.

15:45.150 --> 15:46.280
But I...

15:50.280 --> 15:52.350
<i>Hey, where</i>
<i>did Henry go?</i>

15:52.390 --> 15:56.060
<i>Back to your</i>
<i>planet, probably.</i>

15:56.090 --> 15:58.320
<i>Are we hearing each other</i>
<i>without actually talking?</i>

15:58.360 --> 16:03.260
<i>Affirmative. That is</i> <i>how we
communicate</i> <i>on my planet.</i>

16:03.300 --> 16:06.270
<i>Can you hear me when</i>
<i>I think in a whisper?</i>

16:06.300 --> 16:08.440
<i>Yes.</i>

16:08.470 --> 16:10.440
Okay, this is totally cool.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.340
What's next?
Flying around the galaxy?

16:13.370 --> 16:16.340
No, I'm taking you back to my home planet

16:16.380 --> 16:18.310
and you're going to live there.

16:18.350 --> 16:21.180
I guess that's cool, as
long as I'm home by 6:00.

16:21.220 --> 16:22.520
It's taco night.

16:26.390 --> 16:29.320
Mom, we're home and we're
going to watch a movie.

16:29.360 --> 16:34.330
For some reason, Rocky didn't feel like
spending anymore time out in public.

16:36.130 --> 16:37.300
All right, whatever movie you pick,

16:37.330 --> 16:40.130
just make sure it's no longer
than an hour and 23 minutes.

16:40.170 --> 16:41.300
Ooh, 22!

16:43.070 --> 16:45.270
A <i>Robin Hood.</i>

16:45.310 --> 16:48.410
Hey, we haven't seen that since last night.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.250
Paul, if you're looking for a
duel, you're going to get one.

16:55.480 --> 16:58.120
Uh-uh.
Number one rule is

16:58.150 --> 17:00.420
there is no talking during the movie.

17:00.450 --> 17:02.090
Or after.

17:04.089 --> 17:08.500
Well, why just watch the movie
when you can be the movie?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.099
I don't know what he's about to do,

17:12.130 --> 17:15.270
but it's going to be awesome!

17:15.300 --> 17:17.470
I have brought the a present, fair Rocky.

17:25.349 --> 17:28.480
Oh, I was right.
It is awesome!

17:30.250 --> 17:32.320
Rocky, I cannot wait to see you in that.

17:32.350 --> 17:36.120
Oh, I am not putting that on.
That is just so...

17:36.160 --> 17:38.430
Is the word you're looking for "weird"?

17:38.460 --> 17:40.330
Yes, it's weird.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.200
Weird to wear without a hat!

17:46.370 --> 17:50.110
Well, asketh and ye shall receiveth.

17:56.510 --> 18:00.450
I think someone found something
to wear on photo day.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.120
How many times do I have to tell you,

18:08.160 --> 18:10.260
alien dude, I gotta get home.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.000
I hope you're not going to
complain the whole time.

18:13.030 --> 18:15.100
We have an 18-year
flight ahead of us.

18:17.400 --> 18:21.370
My neck is kind of stiff.
Would you mind if I take off my head?

18:21.410 --> 18:25.380
Yes, I would!
Now slow down, E.T.

18:25.410 --> 18:27.410
Why do you even want me
to come to your planet?

18:27.450 --> 18:31.080
Because our most valuable
energy source is candy

18:31.120 --> 18:35.320
and you've proven yourself to be the
best candy gatherer in the universe.

18:35.350 --> 18:40.020
That is so flattering,

18:40.060 --> 18:41.190
but I can't leave Earth.

18:41.230 --> 18:43.390
See, I took the class
pet home this weekend,

18:43.430 --> 18:47.360
and if that gerbil is not
back by Monday, big trouble!

18:48.530 --> 18:50.500
Okay.

18:50.530 --> 18:53.270
I guess, in that case,
I can just replicate you.

18:54.470 --> 18:56.140
Make copies of you.

18:56.170 --> 18:57.440
Oh!

18:58.440 --> 19:00.180
Whoa!

19:00.210 --> 19:03.210
This kind of tickles!

19:05.080 --> 19:08.090
Okay, I think I'm okay.

19:08.450 --> 19:10.220
I'm okay, too.

19:11.460 --> 19:14.290
Wow, has anyone ever told you

19:14.330 --> 19:17.060
you are extremely
good-looking?

19:18.230 --> 19:20.070
I mean...

19:27.040 --> 19:31.210
Oh, I'm okay!
Oh, everything is back to normal.

19:35.220 --> 19:40.290
Hello, young lord. Come joineth us
and hear the tale of Robin Hood.

19:40.320 --> 19:43.290
I would, but I'm in the
middle of a really bad dream

19:43.320 --> 19:47.060
and I kind of just want to get through it.

19:47.090 --> 19:50.230
Come on, Flynn!
Wake up! Wake up!

19:50.260 --> 19:52.200
I'm having a nightmare!

19:54.140 --> 19:56.370
You and me both.

19:56.400 --> 20:01.080
So, have you had enough and
you're ready to admit I'm right?

20:02.350 --> 20:04.250
Ah! Thank goodness!
I cannot take another...

20:06.120 --> 20:07.250
My watch isn't beeping.

20:07.280 --> 20:10.450
No, 'tis my timepiece.

20:10.490 --> 20:13.420
This farce is at an end.
Brother, let us be off.

20:13.460 --> 20:16.360
Half brother.

20:16.390 --> 20:18.430
Wait, uh, leave?
What are you talking about?

20:18.460 --> 20:20.330
I was trying to expand his horizons.

20:20.360 --> 20:23.130
All he ever does is hang with these
freaky Renaissance fair girls,

20:23.170 --> 20:24.300
so when he met you at the dance...

20:24.330 --> 20:26.230
He begged me to give you a chance.

20:26.270 --> 20:28.540
And I agreed to three hours.

20:28.570 --> 20:31.410
The longest three hours of my life!

20:31.440 --> 20:35.240
What?
No, no, no, no, no.

20:35.280 --> 20:36.510
I was the one giving you three hours.

20:36.550 --> 20:39.250
Do not shame yourself in front of me,

20:39.280 --> 20:41.120
for we were never meant to be.

20:41.150 --> 20:43.520
Now, as for the dress, I shall have
my footman fetch it on the morrow.

20:43.550 --> 20:46.360
Our dad'll pick it up.

20:49.230 --> 20:51.430
Wait, we can still hang, right?

20:51.460 --> 20:53.360
I mean, we have a lot of things in common.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.200
We both do not like your brother.

20:58.430 --> 21:01.540
Don't take this the wrong way.
You're a nice girl,

21:01.570 --> 21:03.140
but that snort thing is really weird.

21:09.510 --> 21:11.510
Really? Now it goes off?

21:14.220 --> 21:17.420
So, uh, anyway, um, where were we?

21:17.450 --> 21:20.320
You were going to say I was...
Huh? I was what?

21:20.360 --> 21:23.090
I was what-what-what?

21:24.090 --> 21:25.490
You were right, CeCe.
Yeah!

21:25.530 --> 21:28.460
I just want to forget this
whole thing ever happened.

21:31.370 --> 21:33.370
It's on my head, isn't it?

21:37.570 --> 21:39.510
Oh! Hey, look,
it's for you.

21:39.540 --> 21:43.580
He says, "The dress is
dry cleaneth only."

21:48.110 --> 21:53.340
And my bishop takes your queen.
Checkmate!

21:53.380 --> 21:56.280
Checkmate?
Check boring!

21:58.010 --> 22:02.220
Again? This is crazy.
I've never lost this many games in a row.

22:02.250 --> 22:04.420
If I didn't know any better...

22:04.450 --> 22:06.120
Flynn, stop.

22:06.160 --> 22:08.020
What?

22:08.060 --> 22:11.060
Well, for a minute, before we got
to know you, we actually thought...

22:11.100 --> 22:14.200
Excuse me.
He actually thought.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.170
That you were an alien.

22:22.070 --> 22:24.930
Yeah. An alien?
That's ridonkulous.

22:25.000 --> 22:25.780
Yeah.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.600
 - He's starting it.
- No he...

22:30.220 --> 22:32.120
- I said he...
- Okay.
