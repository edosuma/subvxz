(narrator)
In the criminal
justice system,

00:02.029 --> 00:03.459
sexually-based offenses

00:03.528 --> 00:05.286
are considered
especially heinous.

00:05.723 --> 00:07.652
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:07.719 --> 00:09.908
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:09.982 --> 00:11.410
are members of an elite squad

00:11.478 --> 00:13.372
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.441 --> 00:14.836
These are their stories.

00:17.433 --> 00:20.326
Police operator 5527.
What's your emergency?

00:20.427 --> 00:22.083
[People chattering]

00:22.390 --> 00:24.375
Caller, can you hear me?

00:26.016 --> 00:27.740
Caller, can you hear me?

00:29.376 --> 00:30.838
What have you got?

00:31.272 --> 00:34.164
Hello, caller, are you there?
Listen.

00:34.599 --> 00:35.620
[Woman screams]

00:35.697 --> 00:36.661
(man)
Shut up!

00:36.729 --> 00:37.987
She must've
dropped her phone.

00:38.059 --> 00:39.544
Do what I say and
I won't hurt you!

00:39.622 --> 00:40.779
What's the location?

00:40.853 --> 00:43.541
Haven't got one.
It's a cell phone.
Only the number's coming up.

00:43.614 --> 00:45.701
Shut up.
Start the car.

00:45.843 --> 00:46.966
Get going!
Okay. Okay.

00:47.041 --> 00:48.096
Come on! Come on!

00:48.172 --> 00:49.795
Where do you want me
to go?
Drive away.

00:49.868 --> 00:51.422
Come on, honey,
tell us where you are.

00:51.498 --> 00:52.825
Which way?
Take a right.

00:52.896 --> 00:54.756
Take a right.
Let's go!

00:54.825 --> 00:56.288
Please don't
kill me.

00:56.356 --> 00:57.683
I'm not going
to kill you.

00:57.753 --> 01:00.010
I've got something else
in mind.

01:00.082 --> 01:03.598
Sweet mother of God.
It's the carjack rapist.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

01:54.241 --> 01:56.032
(woman)
Please don't kill me.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.154
That's it.
There's dead air for a while,
then the call cuts out.

02:00.229 --> 02:01.987
We've been chasing
this guy for a month.

02:02.058 --> 02:04.542
He blitzes his first
four victims from behind,
knocks them out,

02:04.620 --> 02:05.981
rapes them
and steals their cars.

02:06.050 --> 02:07.377
Something's must've
gone wrong.

02:07.447 --> 02:09.874
He didn't dump her.
Tape sounds like
she was next to him.

02:09.943 --> 02:12.268
Which means that
she's the only one
who can ID him.

02:12.338 --> 02:15.264
Is there any way that you can
bring out his voice
more clearly?

02:15.332 --> 02:17.351
Quality's too poor.
She either dropped the phone

02:17.427 --> 02:18.856
or it was in her purse
or pocket.

02:18.925 --> 02:20.887
Voice enhancement
will take a few hours.

02:20.954 --> 02:22.281
How about a fix
on her location?

02:22.352 --> 02:25.607
The phone's first three digits
are an exchange
used by Cell Atlantic.

02:25.678 --> 02:27.606
Tech guy over there says
the call relayed off

02:27.674 --> 02:29.659
two different cell towers.

02:30.435 --> 02:32.364
The first is on
Avenue A and Sixth Street.

02:32.431 --> 02:34.417
(Stabler)
How many blocks
does that cell site cover?

02:34.494 --> 02:37.477
Houston to Seventh
to Avenue B.
Then the call switched over

02:37.554 --> 02:40.877
to the second tower, here,
south of Houston.

02:40.948 --> 02:42.501
Goes all the way
to the East River.

02:42.578 --> 02:45.595
Which means this
could have happened
anywhere within 30 blocks.

02:45.672 --> 02:47.826
If the City had enhanced 911
for cell phones,

02:47.900 --> 02:49.556
we'd know exactly
where this happened.

02:49.630 --> 02:51.354
(Morales)
Settle for a lead on
who she is?

02:51.427 --> 02:52.583
We'll take
whatever you got.

02:52.658 --> 02:54.552
Cell Atlantic says
the phone is one of 18

02:54.620 --> 02:56.843
leased to
the Studio Arts League.

02:57.514 --> 02:59.499
Our artists in residence
spend most of their time

02:59.577 --> 03:01.335
teaching classes
in public schools.

03:01.407 --> 03:03.527
We give them phones
to keep them in touch.

03:03.602 --> 03:05.065
Whose cell phone
number is this?

03:05.133 --> 03:06.652
Um, let me check.

03:07.728 --> 03:09.247
[Francesca murmuring]

03:09.856 --> 03:11.819
Annika Bergeron.
She's a painter.

03:12.385 --> 03:13.904
That's one of hers.

03:13.982 --> 03:16.103
Wonderful sense of
color and line...

03:16.178 --> 03:18.332
Why are you asking
about Annika's phone?

03:18.407 --> 03:20.800
We need to see her.
Do you know where she lives?

03:20.869 --> 03:22.854
Over by
Tompkins Square Park.

03:22.930 --> 03:24.257
Matches where
the call came from.

03:24.328 --> 03:25.814
Yeah. Um,

03:26.191 --> 03:27.847
has Annika come in today?

03:27.920 --> 03:31.437
No, she's home on bed rest
for the last week.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.067
Why?

03:33.477 --> 03:35.870
Annika's pregnant,
due in two weeks.

03:35.938 --> 03:37.957
Doctor says high-risk.

03:42.425 --> 03:44.012
(Tony)
I don't know
where she could be.

03:44.089 --> 03:46.346
Doctor told her
to stay in bed
or she'd lose the baby.

03:46.417 --> 03:48.878
She's been taking
his orders real seriously.

03:48.946 --> 03:50.998
She has an appointment card
for an ob-gyn.

03:51.075 --> 03:52.096
Dr. Crespo.

03:52.173 --> 03:54.725
Who's been helping her out
since she's been on bed rest?

03:54.801 --> 03:57.262
This is a good building.
Folks look out for each other.

03:57.329 --> 03:58.486
Neighbors come by all day,

03:58.560 --> 04:01.112
Annika knows if she's needs
anything at night to call me.

04:01.188 --> 04:02.617
When was the last time
you saw her?

04:02.685 --> 04:04.943
Checked on her last night,
around 9:00.

04:05.013 --> 04:06.340
Said she was
going to sleep.

04:06.411 --> 04:07.500
Does she own a car?

04:07.575 --> 04:09.798
Big, black SUV.
Tahoe, I think.

04:09.871 --> 04:10.960
This doesn't add up.

04:11.035 --> 04:13.054
Pregnant woman on bed rest
doesn't go for a drive

04:13.131 --> 04:15.184
in the middle of the night
without a good reason.

04:15.260 --> 04:16.315
Maybe she got a call.

04:16.391 --> 04:18.512
She went out to her car,
she got jacked.

04:18.587 --> 04:19.810
We'll pull the LUDs,

04:19.884 --> 04:22.311
see who she was talking to
last night.

04:22.380 --> 04:23.400
Is this Annika?

04:23.477 --> 04:25.167
Yeah. Pretty girl, huh?

04:25.240 --> 04:26.862
Baby's father around?

04:26.937 --> 04:28.899
I haven't seen any
guy come around here

04:28.966 --> 04:31.291
since Daniel
moved out last year.

04:31.362 --> 04:32.689
Daniel have a last name?

04:32.758 --> 04:33.915
Daniel Lester.

04:33.990 --> 04:37.075
Nice guy, carpenter,
always helped me fix stuff.

04:37.149 --> 04:38.374
They have any problems?

04:38.447 --> 04:40.636
Not that I saw.
Then one day, poof!

04:40.710 --> 04:41.900
He's gone.

04:41.974 --> 04:43.732
(Stabler)
You know where
we can find him?

04:43.803 --> 04:45.527
Granville Developers.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.823
Big-shot contractors
in midtown.

04:48.460 --> 04:49.685
Annika's missing?

04:49.758 --> 04:51.186
Is there anything
I can do to help?

04:51.255 --> 04:54.011
(Stabler)
The super says
she drives a black SUV,

04:54.083 --> 04:55.807
but we haven't
been able to find anything

04:55.879 --> 04:57.342
registered under her name.

04:57.410 --> 04:58.737
We never had a car.

04:58.807 --> 05:01.290
Annika must have bought it
after I moved out.

05:01.967 --> 05:03.124
You still in touch
with her?

05:03.198 --> 05:06.715
Not much.
She, uh, e-mailed me
a couple of times,

05:07.490 --> 05:09.213
little things like
wanting something

05:09.286 --> 05:10.908
out of a closet.
That sort of thing.

05:10.982 --> 05:13.738
Well, in any of those e-mails,
did she mention a baby?

05:13.844 --> 05:15.329
No. What baby?

05:15.573 --> 05:17.196
Annika's pregnant.

05:18.767 --> 05:19.957
Really?

05:20.165 --> 05:21.458
[Phone ringing]

05:21.661 --> 05:22.919
When is she due?

05:22.992 --> 05:25.612
Soon, and we are concerned
about her medical condition.

05:25.686 --> 05:27.206
We need to speak
with her right away.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.336
(Rose)
Daniel, I promised Melinda

05:29.412 --> 05:32.429
she could
have your attention
for a full five minutes.

05:32.507 --> 05:35.728
The florist needs
the final decision today.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.127
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:37.197 --> 05:40.350
Uh, Jeannie didn't tell me
that you were in a meeting.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.182
This is Rose Granville,
my boss,

05:42.254 --> 05:44.737
and her daughter,
Melinda, my fiancee.

05:44.815 --> 05:47.003
Detectives Benson
and Stabler.

05:47.077 --> 05:49.232
The police? What's wrong?

05:50.004 --> 05:52.591
My ex-girlfriend,
Annika, is missing.

05:53.631 --> 05:54.617
How long?

05:54.695 --> 05:56.158
(Benson)
Since last night.

05:56.226 --> 05:58.709
She made a 911 call
that we couldn't trace.

05:58.787 --> 05:59.978
(Rose)
That's terrible.

06:00.051 --> 06:01.537
We'll let you
finish talking.

06:01.615 --> 06:03.168
We're pretty much done here.

06:03.245 --> 06:05.797
We do need
contact information
for a family member, though.

06:05.873 --> 06:07.460
Annika's parents
are dead,

06:07.537 --> 06:12.425
but her sister, Laura,
lives over in Jersey,
Passaic County.

06:15.753 --> 06:17.579
(Laura)
Annika doesn't own a car.

06:17.749 --> 06:20.437
The... the Tahoe's mine,
I lent it to her.

06:21.243 --> 06:23.102
Did something happen
to my sister?

06:23.172 --> 06:25.066
It's possible she was
carjacked last night.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.757
Is she all right?

06:26.865 --> 06:28.952
We don't know.
She's missing.

06:31.123 --> 06:33.176
Ah, that doesn't
make sense, really.

06:33.252 --> 06:35.237
Because if the car
was stolen, where is she?

06:35.315 --> 06:36.937
She wouldn't just
disappear.

06:37.012 --> 06:38.837
We're doing everything
we can to find her.

06:38.907 --> 06:40.801
Now, did you speak
with her last night?

06:40.870 --> 06:44.727
No, I spoke to her
a couple of days ago
and everything was fine.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.848
(Stabler)
She left her apartment
late at night.

06:46.925 --> 06:48.944
Is it possible she went
to see the baby's father?

06:49.021 --> 06:52.707
As far as Annika's concerned,
the baby doesn't
have a father.

06:52.879 --> 06:55.669
She had a one-night stand
and she never
saw the guy again.

06:55.741 --> 06:57.998
How does she feel
about being a single parent?

06:58.070 --> 07:00.587
She's 31.
She always wanted a child.

07:01.330 --> 07:04.313
She doesn't want to
wait around for Mr. Right.

07:04.756 --> 07:07.081
That baby is all
she talks about.

07:09.414 --> 07:11.239
(Fin)
We canvassed
Annika's block.

07:11.310 --> 07:12.796
The guy at
the bodega next door

07:12.873 --> 07:14.665
said he saw a black SUV
with Jersey plates

07:14.736 --> 07:16.959
parked in front of his store
all week, till this morning.

07:17.032 --> 07:19.391
So we got no car
and no witnesses.

07:19.460 --> 07:20.787
Pregnant women
are fighters.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.444
If Annika resisted,
she could be lying
somewhere injured.

07:23.519 --> 07:26.308
Or he freaked when he saw
she was pregnant, killed her,
dumped her,

07:26.380 --> 07:27.809
then took the car
to a chop shop.

07:27.877 --> 07:30.065
Let's just keep working it
like she is still alive, huh?

07:30.139 --> 07:32.532
Dr. Crespo's here,
Annika's ob-gyn.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.063
I got a message
from Det. Stabler.

07:34.131 --> 07:35.287
That's me.
Thanks for coming.

07:35.362 --> 07:36.383
He says
we have a problem.

07:36.460 --> 07:40.112
Annika can't deliver the baby
vaginally. She has a condition
called placenta previa.

07:40.186 --> 07:41.172
Meaning?

07:41.251 --> 07:43.076
The placenta's
blocking the birth canal.

07:43.146 --> 07:44.904
She's scheduled
for a C-section.

07:44.976 --> 07:47.369
What happens if Annika goes
into labor before then?

07:47.438 --> 07:50.058
The baby tears through,
causing a massive hemorrhage.

07:50.132 --> 07:53.149
Annika bleeds out,
and the baby could die
from lack of oxygen.

07:53.227 --> 07:55.121
(Fin)
Okay. Thanks for the info.

07:55.189 --> 07:58.615
That was Morales.
He got something
off the audio tape.

07:59.514 --> 08:01.408
I didn't get anywhere
with the perp's voice,

08:01.476 --> 08:03.495
but I isolated
the background noises.

08:03.738 --> 08:05.258
Listen to this.

08:06.699 --> 08:07.993
[Dinging]

08:11.657 --> 08:12.915
[Car engine starts]

08:12.987 --> 08:14.348
It's the ignition
turning over.

08:14.417 --> 08:16.606
Exactly. Now they're driving.

08:16.979 --> 08:19.167
Based on the position
where the car was parked,

08:19.241 --> 08:21.634
they're headed
south on Avenue A.

08:22.901 --> 08:23.990
You hear that?

08:24.064 --> 08:25.221
The turn signal?

08:25.296 --> 08:28.085
Yeah.
They're eastbound on Houston.

08:28.157 --> 08:30.017
How do you know
they turned left?

08:30.086 --> 08:31.981
Fast-forward
a few minutes.

08:32.681 --> 08:34.700
One more turn signal
and they're at the highway.

08:34.777 --> 08:36.602
You hear the traffic?

08:37.239 --> 08:39.292
Must be the FDR Drive.
That's the only
highway nearby.

08:39.368 --> 08:40.886
Any idea how
far they traveled?

08:40.965 --> 08:42.621
Listen to the echoes.

08:42.695 --> 08:44.385
[Horns blaring]

08:46.786 --> 08:48.975
They're going under a bridge.

08:49.148 --> 08:52.767
So it's gotta be
the Williamsburg,
Manhattan, or Brooklyn.

08:52.974 --> 08:54.766
Right, but which one?

08:55.801 --> 08:57.820
And then the engine stops.

08:57.964 --> 08:59.983
I'd say they're parked next
to the FDR.

09:00.460 --> 09:03.080
It's the only area
that matches these acoustics.

09:04.651 --> 09:06.443
This place is secluded
enough for a rape.

09:06.513 --> 09:09.406
So were the Williamsburg
and Manhattan bridges.
No sign of her there.

09:09.475 --> 09:10.768
(Dumont)
Over here!

09:10.838 --> 09:12.891
Find her.
Find her, Barnaby.

09:12.967 --> 09:15.020
Find her. Find her, Barnaby.
Find her.

09:15.629 --> 09:17.784
Good dog. Good dog.
Good dog.

09:18.190 --> 09:21.275
The scent trail starts
at the curb, ends here.

09:21.983 --> 09:24.376
Definitely belongs
to your victim.

09:24.445 --> 09:25.874
So he dragged her
over here?

09:25.941 --> 09:27.529
Check out the skid marks.

09:27.672 --> 09:29.294
There was another car here.

09:29.368 --> 09:30.661
Think she was transferred?

09:30.732 --> 09:32.093
Could've had
a partner waiting.

09:32.163 --> 09:33.920
He takes the woman
but leaves the car?

09:33.992 --> 09:35.716
That's not
the carjack rapist's MO.

09:35.789 --> 09:37.683
He's graduated
from rape to kidnap.

09:37.752 --> 09:39.578
Maybe he wants more time
with his victim.

09:39.648 --> 09:41.508
He went to a lot of
trouble to arrange it.

09:41.578 --> 09:45.162
If he took Annika in another
car, where's her SUV?

09:45.237 --> 09:46.598
[Police radio chattering]

09:46.667 --> 09:50.751
Maybe it got towed to impound.
"No parking anytime."

09:52.722 --> 09:55.739
Black Chevy Tahoe,
towed from South
Street and Dover.

09:55.816 --> 09:57.641
Slim Jim?
There you go.

09:58.278 --> 10:00.830
I think we got ourselves
a copycat here,

10:00.906 --> 10:02.130
using a high-profile MO

10:02.203 --> 10:03.530
to send us down
the wrong track.

10:03.601 --> 10:04.723
Somebody targeted Annika.

10:04.798 --> 10:05.784
They called her,

10:05.862 --> 10:07.347
they lured her out
of the apartment,

10:07.426 --> 10:08.549
and kidnapped her.

10:08.624 --> 10:10.347
This was planned.
Got it.

10:14.079 --> 10:16.064
Seat's soaked with blood.

10:18.504 --> 10:20.988
(Siper)
The victim's prints are all
over the steering wheel.

10:21.065 --> 10:24.321
She drove, perp controlled her
from the passenger seat.

10:24.392 --> 10:27.749
His hand was here,
on the back of her headrest.

10:27.818 --> 10:28.907
You lift prints?

10:28.983 --> 10:31.671
I wish.
This bastard's smarter
than the average mutt.

10:31.744 --> 10:33.105
He was wearing
leather gloves.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.501
How'd you get that?

10:34.572 --> 10:36.262
Animal hide has
a unique texture,

10:36.335 --> 10:38.126
plus the stitching
along the seams

10:38.198 --> 10:39.593
makes its own impression.

10:39.662 --> 10:41.249
I can match it
if you find the gloves.

10:41.325 --> 10:43.116
That's easy once
we find out who he is.

10:43.188 --> 10:44.413
Can you help us with that?

10:44.485 --> 10:45.574
I'll have more
in two hours.

10:45.650 --> 10:46.636
(Trevor)
This can't wait.

10:46.715 --> 10:48.109
What have you got?

10:48.178 --> 10:51.003
ME says the blood is
definitely Annika's
with cervical cells present.

10:51.073 --> 10:54.328
Good news: There's no trace
of amniotic fluid,
so she's not in labor yet.

10:54.399 --> 10:55.420
What's the bad news?

10:55.497 --> 10:58.514
I talked to her doctor.
Based on the amount of blood
she's already lost,

10:58.591 --> 11:00.054
he says she's got
36 hours, tops,

11:00.121 --> 11:01.878
before she and the baby
both die.

11:08.238 --> 11:10.529
If it's not
the carjack rapist,
what's the motive?

11:10.600 --> 11:12.358
Don't know.
Annika was squeaky clean,

11:12.430 --> 11:14.154
no problems with
anyone we can find.

11:14.226 --> 11:15.916
Pregnancy elevates
a woman's risk

11:15.989 --> 11:18.416
of intimate partner violence
including homicide.

11:18.485 --> 11:20.004
What do we have on
the baby's father?

11:20.081 --> 11:21.271
He's out
of the picture.

11:21.345 --> 11:23.398
Annika never told him
she was pregnant.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.165
Pregnancy could
still be a factor.

11:25.237 --> 11:26.825
There's a bunch
of cases nationwide

11:26.901 --> 11:28.920
where women are being
snatched for their babies.

11:28.997 --> 11:31.550
In which case
he's stashed her somewhere
until she gives birth.

11:31.625 --> 11:34.245
If we don't find them
in 30 hours, she and
the baby are both dead.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.873
If the perp was after a baby,

11:35.949 --> 11:38.240
she didn't just find Annika
on the street at 3:00 a.m.

11:38.311 --> 11:40.171
You're right.
The LUDs are back.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.033
At 3:16 Annika
got a phone call

11:42.104 --> 11:44.089
from a payphone a block away
from her apartment.

11:44.167 --> 11:45.391
It lasted 50 seconds.

11:45.464 --> 11:47.857
That's 15 minutes
before she called 911.

11:47.926 --> 11:50.443
Then an outgoing call
to a car service.

11:50.521 --> 11:51.882
Dispatcher
remember her?

11:51.951 --> 11:54.435
They say a woman called
asking for
an out-of-town fare.

11:54.513 --> 11:56.407
They sent a car,
but Annika never showed up.

11:56.476 --> 11:58.200
She goes downstairs
to meet the car,

11:58.272 --> 12:00.029
but whatever she's got to do
is so urgent,

12:00.102 --> 12:02.257
she decides to drive herself.
That's when he jumps her.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.691
Where the hell
was she going?

12:03.761 --> 12:06.744
Before she left,
the last call she made
was at 3:22

12:06.822 --> 12:08.251
to her dial-up ISP.

12:08.319 --> 12:09.509
She went online?

12:09.583 --> 12:11.636
Yeah. I had Morales
look at her computer.

12:11.712 --> 12:13.697
She went to
a Maplt Now website,

12:13.774 --> 12:15.759
downloaded
driving directions.

12:15.837 --> 12:17.527
Passaic County Hospital.

12:17.733 --> 12:19.128
Her sister lives in Passaic.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.819
Your sister calls,
says she's hurt.

12:20.894 --> 12:22.550
What would you do?

12:22.790 --> 12:25.081
You think I set up
my own sister?

12:25.152 --> 12:26.581
I didn't call her.

12:26.649 --> 12:29.609
So it's just a coincidence
she was headed for your town
at night?

12:29.677 --> 12:30.970
No, l... I can't explain it.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.628
I haven't even
spoken to her in weeks.

12:32.704 --> 12:35.993
I thought you said you talked
to her a few days ago?

12:36.596 --> 12:37.786
I lied.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.915
I was embarrassed.

12:39.989 --> 12:43.107
I had a fight with her,
and I hung up on the phone.

12:43.814 --> 12:45.402
Let me guess.
You fought over money.

12:45.478 --> 12:46.839
W-Who told you?

12:46.908 --> 12:50.096
Well, the cancelled checks
in Annika's apartment.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.025
She gave you half her salary,
even with a baby on the way.

12:53.097 --> 12:55.388
L... I was having some
cash-flow problems.

12:55.458 --> 12:57.387
That's the understatement
of the year.

12:57.454 --> 12:59.008
Credit cards are maxed out.

12:59.085 --> 13:00.842
Bill collectors have you
on the hot list.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.740
Bankruptcy looks
like a sure thing.

13:02.810 --> 13:05.237
My ex-boyfriend was
a real con artist.

13:05.305 --> 13:08.459
He ran up some major bills,
and then skipped out.

13:09.164 --> 13:12.215
L... I made some mistakes
trying to get out of debt.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.310
Annika was helping me out.

13:14.387 --> 13:15.974
Why would I want her
to disappear?

13:16.051 --> 13:18.239
Well, maybe your boyfriend
thought she was a cash cow,

13:18.313 --> 13:19.368
he wanted
a little extra.

13:19.444 --> 13:21.168
No, no, no. Bob is locked up
in Arizona.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.395
He pulled the same scam
on the sheriff's baby sister.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.950
Now that leaves you all alone
in the jackpot, doesn't it?

13:27.029 --> 13:29.490
Listen, I am telling you,
I never called her.

13:29.557 --> 13:31.043
Someone must've
made up a story

13:31.121 --> 13:32.583
just to get her
out of the house.

13:32.651 --> 13:34.772
Like the father
of the baby?

13:36.709 --> 13:38.694
I promised I would not tell
anyone about him.

13:38.772 --> 13:40.496
Your sister and the baby
are going to die

13:40.569 --> 13:42.394
if we can't find her.

13:46.390 --> 13:49.282
Daniel Lester.
It's her ex-boyfriend.

13:50.382 --> 13:52.344
That's the baby's father.

13:52.811 --> 13:54.603
You think I hurt Annika?

13:54.673 --> 13:56.295
(Benson)
Did you?

13:57.468 --> 13:58.954
I can't believe this.

13:59.031 --> 14:01.821
I was in Boston.
Here's my boarding pass.

14:02.924 --> 14:05.044
I stayed
at the Ritz-Carlton.

14:06.383 --> 14:07.869
Why would I do
anything to her?

14:07.948 --> 14:09.570
Because she's carrying
your child

14:09.644 --> 14:12.002
and you're about
to marry another woman.

14:12.072 --> 14:15.123
It's my baby?
Are you sure?

14:15.200 --> 14:17.661
Annika was.
You two sleeping together?

14:17.727 --> 14:20.586
No. I love Melinda.
Annika and I are through.

14:20.656 --> 14:21.744
(Stabler)
Since when?

14:21.820 --> 14:25.506
You broke up 14 months ago and
she's eight months pregnant.

14:26.510 --> 14:29.936
Gotta be some reason why she
thinks that baby's yours.

14:32.998 --> 14:34.620
It happened once.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.321
It was after we broke up.

14:36.391 --> 14:38.749
I went over to
Annika's apartment

14:39.218 --> 14:42.178
to pick up some
old receipts for my taxes.

14:43.244 --> 14:45.206
And we had a glass of wine

14:45.273 --> 14:47.031
and then another,
and we ended up in bed.

14:47.102 --> 14:48.531
It was stupid.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.995
We laughed
about it afterwards.

14:50.064 --> 14:51.526
Why'd you two break up?

14:51.594 --> 14:53.023
We fought about money.

14:53.091 --> 14:55.745
Rose Granville has got
to be paying you
a pretty good salary.

14:55.818 --> 14:57.112
That was the problem.

14:57.182 --> 14:58.838
Annika said
I was selling out.

14:58.912 --> 14:59.967
But you didn't.

15:00.044 --> 15:02.698
Look, my dad was
a garbage man.

15:02.772 --> 15:04.428
He had six mouths to feed.

15:04.501 --> 15:06.985
Annika thought being
a starving artist was cool.

15:07.063 --> 15:08.548
I knew it wasn't
the life I wanted.

15:08.626 --> 15:10.951
Neither of us
would change our minds,
so we broke up.

15:11.022 --> 15:13.279
And Melinda didn't have
anything to do
with that decision?

15:13.351 --> 15:15.109
No. Annika and I broke up

15:15.180 --> 15:16.803
before Melinda
even knew who I was.

15:16.876 --> 15:19.927
Does your fiancee
know that you slept with her?

15:21.368 --> 15:22.389
No.

15:24.728 --> 15:26.656
But I'm going to
have to tell her now.

15:26.724 --> 15:28.448
(Melinda)
You don't have to tell me.

15:30.450 --> 15:31.777
So Daniel cut
Annika loose

15:31.847 --> 15:33.638
and now he's marrying
the boss's daughter.

15:33.710 --> 15:35.105
This guy just hit
the super lotto.

15:35.174 --> 15:37.828
An illegitimate child
would mess up his plans
to marry into money.

15:37.901 --> 15:40.294
Very least it's going
to cost him a bundle
in child support.

15:40.363 --> 15:42.223
So he makes sure
his pregnant ex-girlfriend

15:42.293 --> 15:44.346
disappears along
with her little secret.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.847
Boston's a four-hour drive
from here.

15:46.917 --> 15:48.936
Easy enough to fly up,
check into a hotel,

15:49.013 --> 15:51.270
drive here, kill Annika,
and back to Boston.

15:51.341 --> 15:52.634
Great way to
establish an alibi.

15:52.705 --> 15:54.134
Playing it real well.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.323
Guess who's got
a rap sheet?

15:56.431 --> 15:58.290
Daniel Lester.
Bingo.

15:58.361 --> 16:00.822
Couple of assault charges,
mostly dismissed.

16:00.890 --> 16:02.784
One plea to
disorderly conduct.

16:02.919 --> 16:04.847
Your boy's got
himself a temper.

16:05.248 --> 16:07.267
(Cragen)
Set up the hotline phones
over here

16:07.343 --> 16:08.398
and keep me informed.

16:08.474 --> 16:09.438
(woman)
You got it.

16:09.505 --> 16:10.434
What's going on?

16:10.503 --> 16:13.327
Only 25 hours left.
One P.P. Is going public.

16:13.397 --> 16:16.686
We're notifying hospital ERs
and OB departments now.

16:16.757 --> 16:18.152
Press conference
in half an hour,

16:18.222 --> 16:19.844
get Annika's face on
the morning news.

16:19.918 --> 16:22.969
Why are we going public when
Lester looks like our perp?

16:23.045 --> 16:26.028
Department isn't prepared
to call him a suspect yet.

16:26.105 --> 16:27.262
They've got
a better theory?

16:27.337 --> 16:29.763
Annika was abducted by
somebody desperate for a baby.

16:29.832 --> 16:31.624
You must be kidding.
We considered that.

16:31.695 --> 16:33.351
We thought it was
a stranger kidnap

16:33.424 --> 16:36.283
before we knew
Lester had a $1 million motive
to get rid of his baby.

16:36.352 --> 16:38.008
The minute you get me proof
he's guilty,

16:38.081 --> 16:39.204
I'll take it to the brass.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.970
(Benson)
Who's gonna cry
for the cameras?

16:41.043 --> 16:42.699
Annika's sister.

16:45.234 --> 16:48.194
Annika was here
yesterday at 3:15 a.m.

16:48.262 --> 16:50.450
Getting into
a black Chevy Tahoe.

16:50.524 --> 16:53.144
If you've seen her,
please contact police.

16:53.218 --> 16:56.406
A tip-line is open and
all calls are confidential.

16:56.478 --> 16:58.066
Please help my sister
and her baby.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.299
Bring Annika to...

16:59.373 --> 17:01.335
Elliot, look who's here.

17:02.267 --> 17:04.252
(Rose)
Good morning, Detectives.

17:05.461 --> 17:06.820
What can
we do for you?

17:06.891 --> 17:09.046
I would like to
speak to the reporters.

17:09.121 --> 17:10.242
Why?

17:10.550 --> 17:13.941
Granville Developers is
offering a $100,000 reward

17:14.077 --> 17:17.593
for information leading to
Annika's safe return home.

17:17.670 --> 17:18.997
That's very generous
of you

17:19.067 --> 17:20.529
considering
that Annika's baby

17:20.597 --> 17:22.355
is the child of
your future son-in-law.

17:22.426 --> 17:23.980
My daughter loves him.

17:24.057 --> 17:27.346
That matters far more to me
than one indiscretion.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.777
Does Melinda
share those feelings?

17:30.844 --> 17:33.203
There are two innocent lives
at stake.

17:33.338 --> 17:35.924
We want to do
whatever we can to help.

17:36.067 --> 17:38.120
(reporter)
Mrs. Granville,
why are you here?

17:38.196 --> 17:39.523
Do you know
the missing girl?

17:39.592 --> 17:41.521
Annika Bergeron
is a family friend.

17:41.588 --> 17:44.605
She's a lovely,
talented young woman
with a promising future.

17:44.683 --> 17:46.804
(Stabler)
Daniel ripped a page
from the O.J. Playbook,

17:46.879 --> 17:49.102
getting Rose to post a reward
for "the real killer."

17:49.174 --> 17:50.535
That guy's
got brass balls.

17:50.604 --> 17:52.828
We have over 500 calls
in less than three hours.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.123
Every bottom feeder in town
is after that reward.

17:55.195 --> 17:57.781
A psychic claimed
she could channel
Annika for a price.

17:57.857 --> 17:58.821
Let me guess.

17:58.888 --> 18:00.612
She's in a cold,
dark place, near water.

18:00.684 --> 18:01.705
(Fin)
I got one.

18:01.782 --> 18:02.768
A guy just called,

18:02.847 --> 18:05.240
said he'd swap
information for Annika
for the reward money.

18:05.308 --> 18:06.965
According to him,
she's still alive.

18:07.038 --> 18:08.365
Why do you think
he's legit?

18:08.435 --> 18:10.397
Well, I asked him
the baby's father's name,

18:10.465 --> 18:12.688
he came right back
with Daniel Lester.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.087
That was our hold back.

18:14.157 --> 18:15.676
Did you set a meet?
He did.

18:15.754 --> 18:17.716
Two hours.
A pedestrian island,

18:17.783 --> 18:19.110
Sixth and Fourth Avenue.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.202
Let's go.

18:20.279 --> 18:22.207
Hold up.
He's got one condition.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.895
He says Daniel's
gotta bring the money.

18:25.734 --> 18:27.696
Stay with
the detectives at all times

18:27.763 --> 18:29.589
and follow their
instructions explicitly.

18:29.660 --> 18:30.681
(Daniel)
I understand.

18:30.757 --> 18:32.220
Daniel, be careful.

18:32.288 --> 18:34.545
Don't worry.
I'm not looking to be a hero.

18:34.617 --> 18:35.910
Daniel's going
to be fine.

18:35.981 --> 18:37.500
Guy's got no reason
to harm him.

18:37.578 --> 18:39.234
(Melinda)
Then why
the bulletproof vest?

18:39.308 --> 18:42.030
Just a precaution.
We got people
covering the entire area.

18:42.101 --> 18:44.688
That corner will
be the safest place
in the city today.

18:44.763 --> 18:47.553
Once Daniel
makes the exchange,
he just walks away.

18:47.624 --> 18:48.917
I have the money, Detectives.

18:48.988 --> 18:50.417
(Morales)
I'll take the briefcase.

18:50.485 --> 18:52.572
What about the FBI?
Don't they handle this?

18:52.648 --> 18:54.009
They're already in place.

18:54.078 --> 18:55.869
Trust me,
we got everything covered.

18:55.941 --> 18:58.028
You'll let us know
the minute this is over?

18:58.104 --> 18:59.726
You have my word.

19:01.031 --> 19:02.618
It's time to go.

19:19.461 --> 19:21.446
It's five after.
He's not coming.

19:21.523 --> 19:22.918
Be patient.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.643
What if he doesn't show up?

19:24.717 --> 19:25.941
He will.

19:26.048 --> 19:29.031
He's got 100,000 good reasons
waiting for him.

19:33.732 --> 19:36.556
2:00. Black coat,
ball cap.

19:36.992 --> 19:38.387
Is that him?

19:39.421 --> 19:40.748
We'll see.

19:41.716 --> 19:43.474
Take your positions.

19:43.712 --> 19:44.936
Here we go.

19:58.649 --> 20:00.135
Where's Annika?

20:00.213 --> 20:01.835
Give me the money.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.701
Tell me where she is.

20:05.603 --> 20:07.225
[Both grunting]

20:08.563 --> 20:09.821
(Benson)
Look out!

20:09.927 --> 20:10.913
[Horn honking]

20:12.955 --> 20:13.976
[Woman screaming]

20:14.052 --> 20:16.071
I'm sorry. I freaked out.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.110
I just wanted to
know where he took her.

20:18.443 --> 20:21.268
Where is she? Where's Annika?

20:21.337 --> 20:23.095
Where the hell is she?

20:23.167 --> 20:25.923
Come on. Talk to me.
Where the hell is she?
Where's Annika?

20:25.995 --> 20:27.752
Come on. Come on.

20:29.322 --> 20:30.716
[Panting]

20:32.915 --> 20:36.999
He's gone.
He didn't say a word.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.352
Our only lead to
Annika is road kill.
We're screwed.

20:46.421 --> 20:48.542
The tips are coming in,
but nothing solid.

20:48.617 --> 20:50.307
Prints on
the dead guy came back.

20:50.380 --> 20:51.865
Greg Jezic.

20:51.943 --> 20:53.996
Two-time loser
with a nasty past.

20:54.073 --> 20:56.625
Bunch of assaults, one murder,
got pled down to Man two.

20:56.701 --> 20:58.595
Parole officer said
he was muscle for hire.

20:58.664 --> 21:00.217
Used to break legs
for some loan shark

21:00.294 --> 21:01.881
until he did
his last bid upstate.

21:01.957 --> 21:03.080
Guy's a
wannabe mercenary.

21:03.154 --> 21:05.876
Advertises in the back pages
of Soldier of Fortune
magazine:

21:05.949 --> 21:07.072
"Have gun, will travel."

21:07.146 --> 21:08.575
Doesn't sound
like Jezic's the type

21:08.644 --> 21:09.971
to come up
with this on his own.

21:10.041 --> 21:11.503
Somebody paid him
to snatch Annika.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.590
Jezic does the job,
hears about the reward,

21:13.667 --> 21:15.526
decides he wants
to get paid twice.

21:15.596 --> 21:17.615
If he left Annika alone
when he came to the meet,

21:17.692 --> 21:19.551
she could be locked up,
bleeding somewhere.

21:19.622 --> 21:22.911
Which leaves us with
about 19 hours left.

21:23.481 --> 21:25.941
John, Fin, keep going
on Jezic's background.

21:26.009 --> 21:27.835
Financials, LUDs,
known associates.

21:27.905 --> 21:30.230
Elliot, Olivia, get a warrant
for the apartment.

21:30.300 --> 21:31.854
Maybe something
there will tell us

21:31.930 --> 21:33.722
who paid Jezic
for the abduction.

21:36.788 --> 21:37.876
(Stabler)
Police! Open up!

21:44.506 --> 21:45.561
We're clear.

21:45.636 --> 21:47.031
What a dump.

21:47.699 --> 21:49.094
There's no blood trail.

21:49.163 --> 21:50.648
I doubt she was ever here.

21:51.724 --> 21:52.948
Porno,

21:54.120 --> 21:57.171
Soldier of Fortune,
more porno, Guns & Ammo.

21:57.247 --> 21:59.833
Well, Jezic's
a real renaissance man.

21:59.974 --> 22:02.799
There's got to be something
here to lead us
to who hired Jezic.

22:02.869 --> 22:06.453
Hey, check this out.
Annika. Telephoto lens.

22:06.529 --> 22:08.320
There's got to be
dozens of pictures here.

22:08.391 --> 22:10.217
Bastard's been stalking her
for a while.

22:10.288 --> 22:12.680
For a guy who lives
like a pig, he keeps
meticulous records.

22:12.749 --> 22:15.574
"2:17 p. M:
Target returns to apartment.

22:15.643 --> 22:19.931
4:16 p. M: Target goes to
the grocery store."

22:20.135 --> 22:21.994
When did you say
the surveillance started?

22:22.064 --> 22:23.720
I didn't.

22:24.725 --> 22:26.245
It's August 22.

22:27.087 --> 22:28.709
August 20,
Jezic received

22:28.784 --> 22:31.109
a $5,000 wire transfer
from Western Union.

22:31.179 --> 22:32.437
Guy works cheap.

22:32.510 --> 22:35.936
That was just a down payment.
He got another $5,000,

22:37.034 --> 22:39.020
the day before
he snatched her.

22:39.097 --> 22:40.753
Western Union funds originated

22:40.827 --> 22:42.449
from an account
in the Cayman Islands.

22:42.523 --> 22:43.850
(Benson)
Whose?
No name.

22:43.921 --> 22:46.178
Banks down there
take privacy very seriously.

22:46.249 --> 22:48.437
(Munch)
Whoever paid Jezic,
they're not going to tell.

22:48.511 --> 22:50.405
In the Caymans,
even asking information

22:50.474 --> 22:52.300
about an account holder
is a crime.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.763
Guys, you've to get us
something we can work with.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.760
We may have
a lead on Jezic's LUDs.

22:56.828 --> 22:59.346
Day before the down payment,
Jezic got a collect call

22:59.424 --> 23:00.852
from an inmate
at Sing Sing.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.381
That's where Jezic
did his last jolt.

23:06.077 --> 23:08.560
(Fergus)
Inmates can only make
collect or prepaid calls.

23:08.638 --> 23:11.792
Either way, They have
to key in their ID number
before using the telephone.

23:11.865 --> 23:13.328
(Stabler)
So who called
Greg Jezic?

23:13.396 --> 23:14.689
Sam Marlett.

23:14.859 --> 23:16.016
What's his story?

23:16.090 --> 23:17.609
No disciplinary
infractions.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.240
Uh, doing six to eight
for extortion.

23:19.317 --> 23:20.746
(Benson)
You know what
the con was?

23:20.814 --> 23:23.774
Yeah. He got his
stripper girlfriend
to bang a married man,

23:23.841 --> 23:25.270
then he tried
to blackmail him.

23:25.338 --> 23:27.731
The mark had balls
and he reported the shakedown.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.625
He had any visitors
since coming upstate?

23:29.696 --> 23:31.817
That's easy enough to check.

23:32.458 --> 23:34.317
One. Daniel Lester.

23:34.387 --> 23:35.373
When?

23:35.452 --> 23:37.108
About a month ago.

23:38.279 --> 23:39.606
I got nothing to say to you.

23:39.676 --> 23:40.765
So just listen.

23:40.841 --> 23:43.393
This is Annika Bergeron,
Daniel Lester's ex-girlfriend,

23:43.469 --> 23:45.328
the one he asked you
to help him get rid of.

23:45.398 --> 23:47.054
I don't know what
you're talking about.

23:47.128 --> 23:49.056
(Benson)
We know that Daniel
came to see you.

23:49.124 --> 23:50.915
He tells you about
his problem,

23:50.987 --> 23:53.675
so you reach out to your old
cellmate, Greg Jezic,

23:53.748 --> 23:55.574
who he hired to
kidnap a vulnerable,

23:55.644 --> 23:57.402
pregnant woman
who never hurt a soul.

23:57.474 --> 24:00.162
I haven't talked to Jezic
since he made parole.

24:00.236 --> 24:01.257
How's he doing?

24:01.333 --> 24:03.057
He's dead, asswipe.

24:03.462 --> 24:05.583
He got greedy, so Daniel
shoved him under a car.

24:05.658 --> 24:08.017
Daniel's doing a very nice job
keeping his hands clean,

24:08.086 --> 24:10.241
which still leaves you
holding the bag.

24:10.315 --> 24:11.710
So you want me
to give Daniel up?

24:11.779 --> 24:12.800
Smart guy.

24:12.877 --> 24:13.898
Screw you.

24:13.974 --> 24:16.435
Daniel is not worth adding
25 to life to your sentence.

24:16.503 --> 24:18.159
He's the only family
I've got.

24:18.233 --> 24:20.387
Daniel never stopped
looking out for me.

24:20.462 --> 24:22.356
He even got me a job
in the mailroom

24:22.424 --> 24:23.819
at Granville Developers

24:23.889 --> 24:26.316
before I screwed up again.
He never gave up on me,

24:26.383 --> 24:27.472
I'm not giving up
on him.

24:27.548 --> 24:29.306
So you're gonna take the fall?
Yeah.

24:29.377 --> 24:32.167
I'll die in here before I say
one word against him.

24:32.239 --> 24:33.929
Kidnaplmurder
conviction will make

24:34.002 --> 24:35.964
that wish come true.
Lethal injection.

24:36.030 --> 24:37.653
Yo, C.O., I want to
go back to my cell.

24:37.727 --> 24:39.916
This is your last chance
to save Annika's life

24:39.990 --> 24:41.680
and your friend
from a capital charge.

24:41.752 --> 24:43.181
Go to hell.

24:43.250 --> 24:45.404
You're right, friends
should stick together.

24:45.478 --> 24:47.463
You and Daniel can share
a cell on death row.

24:47.541 --> 24:48.664
Warden's orders.

24:48.738 --> 24:51.131
He's going to the hole,
no phone privileges.

24:51.201 --> 24:55.250
We wouldn't want you
warning your old pal
that we're coming for him.

24:55.326 --> 24:57.311
Daniel would
never hurt anyone.

24:57.389 --> 25:00.406
Stand By Your Man
sounds much better
when Tammy Wynette sings it.

25:00.482 --> 25:02.240
You're wrong.
(Stabler)
Is that right?

25:02.312 --> 25:03.934
How much do you know
about your fiance?

25:04.009 --> 25:06.561
I know he is a good,
kind, gentle man.

25:06.637 --> 25:08.190
With two arrests
for assault.

25:08.267 --> 25:10.626
He was a kid.
He got in some bar fights.

25:10.695 --> 25:13.178
A couple of nights in jail
does not make him a monster.

25:13.257 --> 25:14.844
But he's got friends
who are.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.610
Sam Marlett's got
a hell of a rap sheet.

25:16.683 --> 25:17.941
Sam from
the mailroom?

25:18.014 --> 25:20.974
Daniel's trying to help him
straighten out his life.
Is that a crime?

25:21.041 --> 25:22.832
Daniel's
a real saint, huh?

25:22.904 --> 25:24.526
He tell you
how Marlett paid him back?

25:24.601 --> 25:26.291
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:26.364 --> 25:29.086
Sam Marlett arranged
Annika's kidnapping.

25:29.425 --> 25:30.910
That can't be true.

25:30.988 --> 25:33.245
I guess you don't know Daniel
as well as you think.

25:33.317 --> 25:34.541
(Fin)
Look what we found.

25:34.614 --> 25:36.701
"Invest in Paradise:
A guide to tax-free,

25:36.777 --> 25:39.102
confidential
Cayman Islands banking."

25:39.172 --> 25:42.562
Brochures from
the same bank the payments
to Jezic came from.

25:42.631 --> 25:44.593
We found it
in Daniel's desk.

25:44.661 --> 25:46.782
Melinda,
where's Daniel now?

25:47.588 --> 25:48.609
I don't know.

25:48.686 --> 25:50.308
Two innocent people
are going to die.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.209
Do you understand that?

25:55.806 --> 25:58.029
He's at the new building site.

25:58.201 --> 26:00.254
(Rose)
Make sure you check
the shipment carefully.

26:00.329 --> 26:01.985
No problem, Rose.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.920
Detectives.
Any news about Annika?

26:03.989 --> 26:05.078
Drop the act.
What?

26:05.154 --> 26:06.481
Put your hands
behind your back.

26:06.551 --> 26:08.342
What are you doing?
This is a mistake!

26:08.414 --> 26:09.638
No, it's not.
What's going on?

26:09.711 --> 26:12.865
Daniel Lester,
you're under arrest for the
kidnapping of Annika Bergeron.

26:12.938 --> 26:14.594
You've got
the right to remain silent.

26:14.668 --> 26:17.289
Don't say a word.
I'll call my lawyer.

26:21.521 --> 26:23.006
I didn't kidnap Annika.

26:23.084 --> 26:25.171
Because you didn't want to
get your hands dirty.

26:25.247 --> 26:27.640
So you paid Greg Jezic
to do the dirty work.

26:27.708 --> 26:28.763
Who?

26:28.840 --> 26:31.732
Greg Jezic, the guy
you pushed under a car.

26:32.765 --> 26:33.922
That was an accident.

26:33.997 --> 26:36.151
Is it an accident
that he's the ex-cellmate

26:36.225 --> 26:37.915
to your best friend,
Sam Marlett?

26:37.989 --> 26:40.472
Sam? What's Sam
got to do with this?

26:40.550 --> 26:41.706
Don't play games
with me.

26:41.780 --> 26:44.639
I'm 30 seconds
from shoving your face
right through that wall.

26:44.709 --> 26:46.829
I swear, I don't know
what you guys
are talking about.

26:46.904 --> 26:49.955
Come on, sure you do.
You wanted Annika
out of the picture,

26:50.031 --> 26:52.923
so she wouldn't get
into the way of your plans
to marry into more money

26:52.992 --> 26:54.886
than you could
ever have made
in 10 lifetimes.

26:54.955 --> 26:57.847
You cry on
Sam Marlett's shoulder,
so he finds Jezic for you.

26:57.915 --> 26:59.502
While you're conveniently
out of town,

26:59.579 --> 27:02.165
Jezic lures Annika
out of the house
and fakes a carjacking.

27:02.240 --> 27:03.793
(Benson)
But you screwed up,
Daniel.

27:03.870 --> 27:06.354
That reward you offered
was a little bit too tempting.

27:06.432 --> 27:08.824
$100,000 sounded
mighty good to Jezic

27:08.893 --> 27:11.377
who you only paid $10,000
for the original job.

27:11.454 --> 27:13.042
Jezic's no fool.

27:13.218 --> 27:14.976
He asks you to
bring him the money

27:15.048 --> 27:16.976
so if things go wrong,
he just gives you up.

27:17.044 --> 27:18.439
But we know what
you did to Jezic.

27:18.507 --> 27:20.765
No! This is insane.

27:21.003 --> 27:22.862
I've never met that man
before in my life.

27:22.932 --> 27:25.359
Daniel, the payments
to Jezic came

27:25.427 --> 27:27.513
from the same bank
in the Cayman Islands

27:27.589 --> 27:29.279
where you do your business.

27:29.353 --> 27:31.281
We found the brochures
in your house.

27:40.231 --> 27:41.751
Where's Annika?

27:44.456 --> 27:45.918
I don't know.

27:48.415 --> 27:49.878
Is she alive?

27:53.371 --> 27:54.834
I don't know.

27:55.568 --> 27:56.554
Daniel,

27:57.263 --> 27:59.192
Annika's going to die.

27:59.326 --> 28:01.345
That baby is going to die.

28:01.954 --> 28:03.849
That baby is your baby.

28:10.637 --> 28:14.154
Yeah. You're right. I did it.

28:17.091 --> 28:18.180
I'm so sorry.

28:18.256 --> 28:20.218
Daniel, it's not
too late to fix this.

28:20.285 --> 28:22.711
Tell us where Annika is
and we can get to her in time.

28:22.780 --> 28:24.141
I don't know
where he took her.

28:24.210 --> 28:25.468
Yes, you do.
Yeah, you do.

28:25.574 --> 28:26.730
Just tell us.

28:26.805 --> 28:28.358
I wish I could.

28:29.267 --> 28:30.889
[Knocking on door]

28:31.629 --> 28:33.852
If she dies because
you're holding out on us,

28:33.924 --> 28:35.386
I will personally
stick that needle

28:35.454 --> 28:37.541
in your arm myself,
you little prick.

28:38.448 --> 28:40.501
I thought he was
going to go for it
at the end there.

28:40.578 --> 28:42.903
Why'd you pull me out?
Did you think I'd hit him?

28:42.973 --> 28:44.334
I know your act, Elliot.

28:44.403 --> 28:46.490
Rose Granville
is in my office.

28:48.395 --> 28:49.881
You've arrested
the wrong man.

28:49.959 --> 28:51.388
Daniel couldn't
have done this.

28:51.456 --> 28:53.248
With all due respect,
Mrs. Granville,

28:53.319 --> 28:55.009
he just confessed.

28:55.814 --> 28:57.470
That's impossible.

28:58.774 --> 29:00.532
Did he say
why he did it?

29:00.604 --> 29:02.589
Marrying your daughter

29:03.199 --> 29:04.923
is quite a lucky break
for a boy

29:04.996 --> 29:07.219
from the wrong side
of the tracks.

29:07.291 --> 29:08.810
Overnight,
he makes the "A" list.

29:08.888 --> 29:10.646
Daniel loves Melinda.

29:10.718 --> 29:12.442
He would never
marry her for her money.

29:12.514 --> 29:13.977
I made sure of that.

29:14.045 --> 29:15.701
So you were concerned?

29:15.775 --> 29:16.999
(Rose)
Of course.

29:17.371 --> 29:20.263
I made a mistake
marrying Melinda's father.

29:20.332 --> 29:22.657
I wasn't going to let
history repeat itself.

29:22.727 --> 29:23.713
He left you?

29:23.792 --> 29:25.686
With half my money
and my secretary.

29:26.121 --> 29:28.049
But Daniel isn't like that.

29:28.117 --> 29:30.079
(Stabler)
You had him checked out?

29:30.877 --> 29:33.770
A woman in my position
has to protect her family.

29:33.838 --> 29:35.664
Did your private detective
find anything?

29:35.735 --> 29:37.754
No. He's devoted
to my daughter.

29:37.831 --> 29:39.124
He cheated on your daughter.

29:39.194 --> 29:41.882
She forgave him.
So did I.

29:41.955 --> 29:43.645
But he didn't know
you would.

29:43.719 --> 29:46.271
Why would he risk that
when he could make
the problem disappear?

29:46.347 --> 29:49.432
Daniel is not capable
of violence.

29:49.507 --> 29:51.230
He killed the man
who kidnapped Annika.

29:51.303 --> 29:53.061
That was a freak accident.

29:53.133 --> 29:56.286
You're railroading him based
on your fantasy of who he is.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.549
Yes, Daniel grew up poor,

29:58.622 --> 30:01.776
but he would never
kill anyone to get rich.

30:01.849 --> 30:03.834
Ma'am, you're entitled
to your opinion.

30:03.978 --> 30:05.997
But we're running out
of time.

30:06.074 --> 30:07.696
Daniel does know
where Annika is,

30:07.771 --> 30:09.824
and if he doesn't tell us,
she dies.

30:14.723 --> 30:17.241
I can see that
I can't convince you.

30:18.849 --> 30:21.003
Perhaps my lawyer
can persuade

30:21.077 --> 30:23.765
the District Attorney
not to file charges.

30:24.803 --> 30:27.094
He went to law school
with him.

30:27.465 --> 30:29.189
Goodbye, gentlemen.

30:31.024 --> 30:33.814
She's definitely going to put
her money where her mouth is.

30:33.886 --> 30:36.710
[Knocking on door]
Without more evidence,
we don't have a chance.

30:36.779 --> 30:37.868
(Fin)
Lab just called.

30:37.944 --> 30:39.997
They may have something
that'll help.

30:43.932 --> 30:46.120
Warner sent over Jezic's
clothes from the morgue.

30:46.194 --> 30:47.850
Found this in
his pants pocket.

30:47.924 --> 30:48.979
Looks like a receipt.

30:49.055 --> 30:51.041
Took me an hour to unfold
without shredding it.

30:51.118 --> 30:52.377
Too much blood.
It's illegible.

30:52.448 --> 30:53.571
To the naked eye.

30:53.646 --> 30:55.007
That's why God
invented lasers.

30:55.076 --> 30:57.062
Different frequencies
reveal different inks.

30:57.139 --> 30:59.226
Who knew?
Kill the lights.

30:59.734 --> 31:02.025
We'll start at
400 nanometers.

31:05.988 --> 31:07.315
Nothing.

31:07.452 --> 31:08.779
Trying 500.

31:12.342 --> 31:13.827
Still nothing.

31:14.305 --> 31:16.097
Let's see what 600 does.

31:18.796 --> 31:20.815
I'll be damned.
I can read that clear as day.

31:20.892 --> 31:22.117
(Fin)
Gas receipt.

31:22.189 --> 31:24.344
Jezic tanked up
an hour before the meet.

31:24.484 --> 31:26.776
Moe's Gas 'n' Go,
in the Rockaways.

31:26.846 --> 31:28.604
I know that place.
It's out by the beach.

31:28.676 --> 31:30.161
I used to spend
my summers there.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.295
Let's go.

31:31.371 --> 31:33.061
(Moe)
Sure, I've seen him.
When?

31:33.135 --> 31:34.654
Yesterday,
maybe the day before.

31:34.731 --> 31:36.216
Drove a black Mustang.

31:36.294 --> 31:37.451
Nice car, but beat to hell.

31:37.525 --> 31:38.819
You know which way
he came from?

31:38.889 --> 31:40.443
Not the bridge,
that's for sure.

31:40.519 --> 31:42.448
Plenty of service stations
closer than mine,

31:42.516 --> 31:44.205
that's why my business
is in the toilet.

31:44.278 --> 31:46.569
If a guy wanted privacy,
you know, no neighbors,

31:46.640 --> 31:48.466
there a place around here
he might hole up?

31:48.537 --> 31:51.089
There's a couple of old
cottages on the beach
around the point.

31:51.165 --> 31:52.990
Pretty deserted
out there after Labor Day.

31:53.061 --> 31:54.388
This way, right?
Yeah.

31:54.459 --> 31:56.318
Hey, you won't make it
in that car.

31:57.453 --> 31:58.711
Take my truck.

31:59.648 --> 32:01.009
[Seagulls cawing]

32:09.495 --> 32:11.514
No cars, no signs of life.

32:13.687 --> 32:15.706
Could be
any one of these.

32:16.747 --> 32:17.938
I'll call for backup.

32:18.011 --> 32:19.100
(woman)
Help! Please!

32:19.176 --> 32:20.832
Did you hear that?

32:24.300 --> 32:25.524
Please help.

in labor with complications.

Please don't let my baby die.

33:02.755 --> 33:04.650
No one's gonna be
dying around here, okay?

33:04.719 --> 33:05.977
Just relax.

at least 10 minutes.

How long have
you been in labor?

almost out.

going to be dead.

You can't do that.

The ambulance isn't here.
You must wait for it.

33:21.319 --> 33:22.543
No, then my baby will die.

You listen to me.

If you give birth
to that baby now,
you will bleed to death.

a first-aid kit
and a flashlight,

You take the fall for Melinda
and you go to jail,

37:16.484 --> 37:18.242
and she's all alone.

37:21.973 --> 37:23.526
Can I hold her?

37:25.899 --> 37:27.294
Here you go, honey.

37:27.363 --> 37:28.349
[Baby cries]

37:29.192 --> 37:30.621
There you go,
sweetie.

37:43.298 --> 37:45.056
You said it was urgent.
Is Daniel okay?

37:45.128 --> 37:46.386
He's fine.
We're releasing him.

37:46.458 --> 37:48.578
Thank God. L... I knew
he couldn't have done this.

37:48.654 --> 37:49.912
Um, I-I've got
to go see him.

37:49.984 --> 37:52.706
We still have to
clear up a few things.

37:53.610 --> 37:55.505
Why'd you visit Annika?

38:00.696 --> 38:03.157
I fell in love with Daniel
the first moment I saw him.

38:03.225 --> 38:05.448
But I was afraid he still had
feelings for Annika.

38:05.520 --> 38:08.037
So you talked to her,
woman to woman?

38:08.946 --> 38:10.432
About a month ago.

38:10.510 --> 38:14.060
And I just knew that
it was Daniel's baby.

38:15.500 --> 38:19.617
She tried to deny it,
but I just knew.

38:20.623 --> 38:24.071
And Annika said that she
wasn't going to tell him.

38:24.382 --> 38:26.106
But you didn't believe her.
You panicked.

38:26.179 --> 38:27.268
It was falling apart.

38:27.343 --> 38:28.829
And you thought
of Sam Marlett.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.335
He'd do anything
to help Daniel.

38:30.404 --> 38:31.459
No, it wasn't me.

38:31.535 --> 38:33.622
Couple of calls,
a little bit of money,

38:33.697 --> 38:35.716
all of your problems
just disappear.

38:35.793 --> 38:37.256
You're wrong!

38:40.118 --> 38:41.309
Daniel.

38:41.981 --> 38:43.500
Don't touch me.

38:43.877 --> 38:45.340
You have got to believe me,

38:45.407 --> 38:47.392
I would never ever
hurt Annika.

38:47.470 --> 38:49.988
Jezic told Annika
a woman hired him.

38:50.098 --> 38:51.561
I swear, it was not me.

38:51.629 --> 38:53.488
Melinda, nobody knew that

38:53.558 --> 38:55.645
Daniel was the father
except you.

38:57.916 --> 38:59.311
Who else knows?

38:59.380 --> 39:00.400
No one.

39:00.477 --> 39:01.963
You're a liar.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.129
(Benson)
Melinda.

39:05.867 --> 39:07.625
You have to tell us.

39:11.223 --> 39:12.447
I can't.

39:16.978 --> 39:18.769
You told your mother.

39:20.970 --> 39:22.694
She knew Marlett
from the mailroom.

39:22.767 --> 39:24.955
She was the one
who put the bank brochure
in your house.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.719
You knew.
All along, you knew.

39:26.791 --> 39:27.948
No, I didn't.

39:28.023 --> 39:29.508
You let Annika die.

39:29.586 --> 39:32.070
No. I did not find out
until this afternoon.

39:32.147 --> 39:34.768
I went to our business manager
to get money for your bail.

39:34.842 --> 39:36.101
I didn't have enough cash,

39:36.173 --> 39:38.033
so I asked him about
your Cayman account,

39:38.103 --> 39:40.122
and he said that you didn't
have one. Only Mom does.

39:40.198 --> 39:41.287
Why didn't you
say anything?

39:41.363 --> 39:43.880
Because it was too late
to help Annika.

39:43.957 --> 39:47.405
And you were going to let
your mother get away with it.

39:50.445 --> 39:52.032
She's my mother.

39:54.370 --> 39:56.956
I love her.
I didn't know what to do.

40:07.178 --> 40:10.296
Daniel, my attorney said
you've been released.

40:10.771 --> 40:12.064
What wonderful news.

40:12.135 --> 40:13.791
How could you do this?

40:13.865 --> 40:15.588
I don't understand.

40:16.393 --> 40:19.218
I know I'm not the man
you'd have chosen
to marry your daughter.

40:19.287 --> 40:22.678
No education,
no money, no future.

40:24.910 --> 40:27.370
But I would have
loved your daughter.

40:27.438 --> 40:29.366
I would have been good to her.

40:29.633 --> 40:30.994
Where are you going, Daniel?

40:31.064 --> 40:32.788
Mom, they know
it was you.

40:33.226 --> 40:34.621
What did you
say to them?

40:34.690 --> 40:36.448
Why did you do this?

40:37.351 --> 40:39.835
Why? I had no other choice.

40:40.012 --> 40:43.869
You love Daniel. You deserve
a wonderful life together.

40:43.939 --> 40:45.833
That baby would
have ruined everything.

40:45.901 --> 40:48.361
I told you
that didn't matter to me.

40:48.596 --> 40:49.582
Oh,

40:50.159 --> 40:52.178
you've always
been so trusting.

40:52.255 --> 40:53.979
But I know men.

40:54.084 --> 40:56.137
Daniel would have taken
your money

40:56.214 --> 40:58.437
and gone back to
that woman and her baby.

40:58.509 --> 40:59.495
No.

40:59.574 --> 41:02.500
I did this for you.
I wanted you to be happy.

41:02.568 --> 41:03.895
That's all I ever wanted!

41:03.965 --> 41:07.186
Rose Granville,
you are under arrest
for kidnapping and the murder

41:07.259 --> 41:08.314
of Annika Bergeron.

41:08.390 --> 41:09.875
You have the right
to remain silent.

41:09.953 --> 41:11.677
Anything you say
can and will be used...

41:11.749 --> 41:13.212
Daniel, wait.

41:13.579 --> 41:14.769
Daniel!
