WEBVTT

00:02.728 --> 00:03.961
I want to do Journey, of course.

00:03.963 --> 00:05.896
And Jess wants to Adele.
Of course.

00:05.898 --> 00:06.964
We can't decide.

00:06.966 --> 00:08.165
JESS:
Hail Mary--

00:08.167 --> 00:09.399
we decide to do The Doors!

00:09.401 --> 00:12.302
And we bring the house...

00:12.304 --> 00:14.304
(laughing):
down.

00:14.306 --> 00:16.373
(grunts)

00:17.176 --> 00:18.842
Oh, that's the end?

00:18.844 --> 00:19.810
Yeah.
Riveting.

00:19.812 --> 00:20.844
I like the story.

00:20.846 --> 00:22.312
You know, The Doors?

00:22.314 --> 00:23.647
Man, that's a nice
white group.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.315
Yeah, I love
that you two are dating.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.484
Well, Cece and I have moved on

00:27.486 --> 00:30.020
to a very different
and more exciting chapter.

00:30.022 --> 00:32.022
We'd like to invite all
of you to a walkthrough

00:32.024 --> 00:33.423
of our new kitchen.

00:33.425 --> 00:35.158
We have finally have walls.
Got the walls!

00:35.160 --> 00:37.160
Wait, you're just
getting walls now?

00:37.162 --> 00:38.261
Who's building
your house--

00:38.263 --> 00:39.663
congress? (laughs)

00:39.665 --> 00:41.331
So relevant.
To the news of today.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.332
Mm-hmm.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.433
Truth be told, we've had

00:43.435 --> 00:44.668
some trouble
with our contractor.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.370
He's a real Joe Public.

00:46.372 --> 00:49.039
Just a newspaper-and-dump
kind of guy.

00:49.041 --> 00:50.941
Robby, hey.

00:50.943 --> 00:52.275
I haven't seen you
at the marina.

00:52.277 --> 00:53.343
ROBBY: Hey, Joan.
I know.

00:53.345 --> 00:54.378
I haven't been sailing much

00:54.380 --> 00:56.046
since I broke
most of my body and face.

00:56.048 --> 00:57.381
Oh, you look good to me.

00:57.383 --> 00:58.882
We should grab dinner.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.283
Or breakfast.

01:00.285 --> 01:01.284
Or both.

01:01.286 --> 01:02.352
(Robby laughing)

01:02.354 --> 01:04.287
Uh, I don't know.

01:04.289 --> 01:06.356
But it's really great
to see you so far inland.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.191
Great to see you, too.
(chuckles)

01:08.193 --> 01:09.359
Keep it moving, Joan.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.361
Your purse don't
match your bangs.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.063
Sorry about that, Jess.
Why are you sorry?

01:13.065 --> 01:14.965
(mouth full):
The boat lady was hit--

01:14.967 --> 01:16.233
The boat lady
was hitting on him.

01:16.235 --> 01:18.635
Right in front of you.
So?

01:18.637 --> 01:19.903
I don't own him.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.905
He's not the box set
of<i> Felicity.</i>

01:21.907 --> 01:23.807
Question,
because I'm invested.

01:23.809 --> 01:26.043
Um, are you two exclusive?

01:26.045 --> 01:27.811
Oh, well, we haven't had
Well, I mean--

01:27.813 --> 01:29.146
a proper conversation about it.
Yeah, I don't think--

01:29.148 --> 01:30.380
JESS:
There's a whole...

01:30.382 --> 01:31.882
This feels like
a private conversation...

01:31.884 --> 01:33.050
(shushing)

01:33.052 --> 01:34.718
Respectfully, I'd like to

01:34.720 --> 01:36.053
take it slow, you know?

01:36.055 --> 01:36.920
'Cause I'm always

01:36.922 --> 01:38.155
diving into the deep end

01:38.157 --> 01:39.423
in relationships

01:39.425 --> 01:40.657
And I'd kind of like

01:40.659 --> 01:42.092
to splash around
the shallow end.

01:42.094 --> 01:44.594
I get it. Let's just let
this chicken marinate.

01:44.596 --> 01:45.762
So, what are we
looking at here?

01:45.764 --> 01:47.330
Uh, open relationship?

01:47.332 --> 01:48.498
Friends with benefits?

01:48.500 --> 01:51.268
The old "dog and bone"
situation?

01:51.270 --> 01:52.903
We're just two people
hanging out

01:52.905 --> 01:55.238
in a cool and modern way.
(chuckles)

01:56.942 --> 01:58.108
Welcome to the future.

01:58.110 --> 01:59.176
What exactly is

01:59.178 --> 02:00.844
a "dog and bone" situation?

02:00.846 --> 02:02.512
I'm assuming
you-you're the bone--

02:02.514 --> 02:04.014
You know damn well
I was the bone!

02:04.016 --> 02:05.916
Almost broke my neck.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.451
I am terrified about what women
have done to you, Winston.

02:07.453 --> 02:09.252
We all got to get off, right?

02:09.254 --> 02:11.855
We all got to get--
I'm gonna need you to leave.

02:11.857 --> 02:12.956
I saw that coming.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.025
¶ ¶

02:16.862 --> 02:18.195
Ooh!<i> Officer and a Gentlemen!</i>

02:18.197 --> 02:19.196
Yes.

02:19.198 --> 02:20.263
Nice.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.632
Um,<i> Die Hard 2!</i>

02:22.634 --> 02:24.601
I truly love pre-movie trivia.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.603
Me, too, and I love seeing
the local advertisements.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.139
I like knowing who's hot
in the teeth-whitening game.

02:29.141 --> 02:31.141
Also, Robby, I just want to say

02:31.143 --> 02:33.143
I'm really happy
we're both on the same page

02:33.145 --> 02:35.312
about taking it slow.

02:35.314 --> 02:36.713
I feel really great about it.
Me, too.

02:36.715 --> 02:38.281
And, actually, I got
a date this weekend.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.549
(laughing)

02:40.452 --> 02:41.384
Really?

02:41.386 --> 02:42.786
With the boat lady?

02:42.788 --> 02:44.287
Oh, no, it's a
woman I work with

02:44.289 --> 02:45.789
at the factory, Babs.

02:45.791 --> 02:46.957
You work in a factory?

02:46.959 --> 02:49.126
Well, no, actually,
um, I design them.

02:49.128 --> 02:51.795
Oh, well, that's
not fascinating at all.

02:51.797 --> 02:54.297
That's fresh from
the sarcasm factory,

02:54.299 --> 02:55.966
(laughs)
'cause it is fascinating.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.634
Thought you would've
mentioned that before.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.002
You guys ask me
surprisingly little

02:59.004 --> 03:00.137
about my personal life.

03:00.139 --> 03:01.905
You're okay with this, right?

03:01.907 --> 03:03.340
I mean, you wanted
to see other people.

03:03.342 --> 03:05.642
Yeah.
Yeah, I definitely said that.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.978
Yeah, I actually
have a date, too.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.412
You do?
Mm-hmm.

03:09.414 --> 03:12.249
With who?
Shh, trailers are starting.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.085
Okay, this way.

03:15.087 --> 03:16.319
Come on in.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.487
Wait, so Robby has a date?

03:17.489 --> 03:18.588
That was so fast.

03:18.590 --> 03:20.757
The man didn't waste any time.

03:20.759 --> 03:22.159
But you know what?

03:22.161 --> 03:23.426
It's okay,
'cause I'm dating, too.

03:23.428 --> 03:24.494
But you aren't, though.

03:24.496 --> 03:25.829
Your guy's fake.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.330
Can we come back to Robby

03:27.332 --> 03:29.032
designing factories?

03:29.034 --> 03:30.600
The man is an enigma.
He's my second best friend,

03:30.602 --> 03:31.668
and I know nothing
about him.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.004
Now, can we please focus?

03:34.006 --> 03:36.273
We are doing
a formal walkthrough.

03:36.275 --> 03:39.910
Behold, the kitchen of tomorrow.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.182
Where are the dang walls?!

03:45.184 --> 03:47.450
Mr. Jason said one week
at the latest.

03:47.452 --> 03:48.852
No! No! No!

03:48.854 --> 03:51.121
Uh, a minute alone
with the boy?

03:51.123 --> 03:52.956
Hey, bud.

03:52.958 --> 03:54.558
Nick...

03:54.560 --> 03:56.059
I am at my wit's end here.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.861
Should I call
the Better Business Bureau?

03:57.863 --> 03:59.563
Better Business Bureau--
that's not a real thing...

03:59.565 --> 04:01.298
It's a very real thing
and as a man

04:01.300 --> 04:03.700
who co-owns a small business
with you, I'm alarmed.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.236
Okay, you just got to know
how to talk to these people.

04:06.238 --> 04:08.305
SCHMIDT:
There's Mr. Jason over there.

04:08.307 --> 04:10.073
See the brunette
with his arms crossed?

04:10.075 --> 04:11.708
NICK:
Okay, let me
take a crack at this.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.143
And don't call men brunettes.

04:13.145 --> 04:14.978
We've talked about this before.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.251
That's a nice grain.
Great grain.

04:21.253 --> 04:23.086
Got to cut with the grain.
Uh, always.

04:23.088 --> 04:24.387
Watch the fingers.
It's a living.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.223
Get the hands dirty.
Yeah, you know,

04:26.225 --> 04:27.891
early bird gets the worm.
(laughs)

04:27.893 --> 04:28.992
Clean your jeans.

04:28.994 --> 04:30.660
Ask her what time it is,

04:30.662 --> 04:32.829
she'll tell you to build
a watch, you know?

04:32.831 --> 04:35.065
Would you look at that?
It's good, though.
It's good framing.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.499
Ah, it's beautiful, stuff, yeah.
These guys are good.

04:36.501 --> 04:37.400
You guys have done
beautiful stuff.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.236
Where does a modern girl go

04:39.238 --> 04:41.238
to make a fake guy real?

04:41.240 --> 04:42.839
That is an insane combination
of words.

04:42.841 --> 04:44.574
It's not the Internet, a bar

04:44.576 --> 04:46.243
or a nightclub,
'cause I'm uncomfortable

04:46.245 --> 04:47.611
with all those.
You're taking

04:47.613 --> 04:49.112
a lot of options off the table.

04:49.114 --> 04:50.447
And are you sure
you're just not scared

04:50.449 --> 04:51.781
to get serious with Robby

04:51.783 --> 04:53.183
because you
don't want to get hurt?

04:53.185 --> 04:54.517
No, I'm not scared,
I just...

04:54.519 --> 04:56.786
don't want to start
a relationship

04:56.788 --> 04:59.256
with someone I barely know.
I mean, he has a boat.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.524
What's next, a kid?
And then I have to meet

05:01.526 --> 05:03.960
the boat and the kid
at some weird sea luncheon?

05:03.962 --> 05:05.362
Honestly,

05:05.364 --> 05:07.597
playing the field sounds
really exciting to me.

05:07.599 --> 05:11.134
You know, going to strange
places with strange men.

05:11.136 --> 05:13.103
Sign me up for that.
You know,

05:13.105 --> 05:14.271
that certainly sounds
like you, Jess.

05:14.273 --> 05:15.639
You know what,
you should just start right now.

05:15.641 --> 05:17.274
There's a lot of guys here.

05:17.276 --> 05:19.442
You should go and...
talk to one.

05:19.444 --> 05:20.477
At a construction site?

05:20.479 --> 05:21.978
We... support it.

05:21.980 --> 05:23.546
JESS:
Okay, I can't tell

05:23.548 --> 05:25.048
if you're mocking me-- but fine,

05:25.050 --> 05:26.616
I'll go have a look around.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.285
Fine.
Fine.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.553
I see what you did there.
Yeah,

05:30.555 --> 05:32.489
the quicker this plays out,
the sooner she'll realize

05:32.491 --> 05:33.990
how ridiculous she's being.

05:33.992 --> 05:35.558
Now, I'm not trying
to break stones over here,

05:35.560 --> 05:37.127
but what can we do
about these walls?

05:37.129 --> 05:38.995
I can't do the walls
until they do the electric,

05:38.997 --> 05:41.331
and I can't do the
electric without my guy.
You got to have

05:41.333 --> 05:43.133
your guy, I get it,
but what am I gonna do?

05:43.135 --> 05:44.467
JASON:
If I could I would,
but I'm not Santa Claus.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.635
What do you want me to do?
What?

05:45.637 --> 05:46.836
Do I need to get your mother
out here to do it?

05:46.838 --> 05:48.071
'Cause I'll call
your mother.

05:48.073 --> 05:49.839
I got her in my phone.
You're gonna call my mother?

05:49.841 --> 05:51.675
Yeah, I'm gonna call
your mother.
All right,

05:51.677 --> 05:53.310
you sack of crap.
(laughing)

05:53.312 --> 05:54.311
I'll make a call.
Thank you.

05:54.313 --> 05:55.312
All right.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.080
Great!

05:57.082 --> 05:58.982
What the hell was that?
Oh, he's gonna

05:58.984 --> 06:01.251
call his guy-- he's gonna see
what he can do about the walls.

06:01.253 --> 06:03.353
Thank goodness. I thought it was
gonna be a physical altercation.

06:03.355 --> 06:04.487
Nah, he's a good guy,
he's a good guy.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.822
Salt of the earth.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.424
It's more about what's
unsaid, you know?

06:07.426 --> 06:09.526
What it comes down to at the
end of the day is respect.

06:09.528 --> 06:11.528
And I have it for him
and he has it for me.

06:11.530 --> 06:12.696
Interesting.

06:12.698 --> 06:14.698
So Mr. Jason
doesn't respect me?

06:14.700 --> 06:16.266
Oh, God, no.
I mean, Schmidt,
Hmm.

06:16.268 --> 06:19.169
I love you, but... but you're
not a man of the people.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.538
Of course I'm not a man of the
people-- I'm above the people.

06:21.540 --> 06:23.206
I want the people
to build things for me.

06:23.208 --> 06:26.009
And that's where I come in.
I can't rely on your...

06:26.011 --> 06:28.445
crass Chicago
street smarts forever.

06:28.447 --> 06:29.512
I'm a homeowner,

06:29.514 --> 06:31.114
and I'm a husband,

06:31.116 --> 06:33.216
and hopefully,
one day I'll be a father.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.385
If he's not gonna respect me,
then I need to become

06:35.387 --> 06:38.188
someone that he will.
That sounds a little scary.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.190
Who-who are you looking
to become, Schmidt?

06:40.192 --> 06:41.624
You.

06:47.132 --> 06:48.565
Ugh.

06:48.567 --> 06:50.200
Anyway, if any
of you gentlemen

06:50.202 --> 06:53.703
are looking for something modern
and non-exclusive...

06:53.705 --> 06:54.804
You got a nail in your ass.

06:54.806 --> 06:56.806
Oh. Um, that's not my ass,

06:56.808 --> 06:58.708
that's actually my dress.
(groans)

06:58.710 --> 06:59.743
Could one
of you guys

06:59.745 --> 07:01.378
help me?

07:01.380 --> 07:03.880
No, we're busy right now.
Come on.

07:06.818 --> 07:08.818
Oh. Thank you...

07:08.820 --> 07:10.820
<i> Es</i> good?

07:11.990 --> 07:13.323
<i> Es</i> very good.
(chuckles)

07:19.398 --> 07:21.264
¶ ¶

07:21.266 --> 07:23.833
Mm! So, how's Babs?
Is she puttin' out?

07:23.835 --> 07:26.436
Well, she's great. I-I haven't
gone out with her yet,
Oh.

07:26.438 --> 07:28.605
but I look forward
to getting to know her

07:28.607 --> 07:30.673
in a relaxed and modern way.

07:30.675 --> 07:32.275
Great.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.110
I'm ready to tell you
about my guy now.

07:34.112 --> 07:35.612
His name is Stavros,

07:35.614 --> 07:38.081
and he is Greek,
which is exciting.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.249
That's... very exciting.
Well, he sounds...

07:39.251 --> 07:41.251
Yeah.
...sounds very sexy.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.852
I can't believe she met a
man at a construction site.

07:42.854 --> 07:44.454
I mean, I'm kind
of impressed.

07:44.456 --> 07:46.689
He thinks it's really funny
how big our drinks are.

07:46.691 --> 07:48.091
They are big.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.626
I'm concerned Robby
doesn't care.

07:49.628 --> 07:51.094
They're testing
each other.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.862
Look at his
bottom lip.

07:52.864 --> 07:55.031
Stavros is taking me
to a club on Friday.

07:55.033 --> 07:56.599
Ah. Yeah, okay.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.301
I get it; he cares.

07:58.303 --> 07:59.769
Okay, uh...

07:59.771 --> 08:01.971
We were supposed
to go out on Friday.
Oh!

08:01.973 --> 08:03.139
I'm sorry. You know what?

08:03.141 --> 08:04.607
Should I cancel?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.476
No. It's okay.

08:06.478 --> 08:09.212
I'll just go out
on Friday with Babs.

08:09.214 --> 08:11.147
Sounds fun.

08:11.149 --> 08:12.148
It's gonna be fun.

08:12.150 --> 08:15.985
Or... crazy idea.

08:15.987 --> 08:18.721
What if we all
hang out together?

08:18.723 --> 08:19.789
Very interesting.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.324
Like a double date?

08:21.326 --> 08:22.625
That seems precarious.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.394
Oh, it's totally
just gonna blow up

08:24.396 --> 08:26.329
in their faces, and they're
gonna need us when it does,

08:26.331 --> 08:28.331
so we should probably
be on call.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.566
Absolutely. Yeah.

08:29.568 --> 08:30.967
We're a very
important part of this.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.402
What'd I tell you?

08:32.404 --> 08:34.170
They're putting
the electrical in.

08:34.172 --> 08:35.472
Ta-da!

08:35.474 --> 08:36.906
Don't say ta-da
around these guys.

08:36.908 --> 08:39.175
And why are you
wearing my clothes?
I'm you.

08:39.177 --> 08:41.845
You are making this way
creepier than it needs to be.

08:41.847 --> 08:44.013
But let's work
on your stance, okay?
Okay.

08:44.015 --> 08:46.516
You're gonna want to adjust
your pants a lot, like watch me.

08:46.518 --> 08:48.585
Like this. Just like looking
around, checking it out,

08:48.587 --> 08:50.053
adjust your pants; try it.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.723
Just do it normal,
just do it normal.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.526
Don't make that face.

08:56.528 --> 08:58.695
Regular face.

08:58.697 --> 09:00.830
If you're gonna do anything
with your shoulders, it's this.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.699
Just relax... No.

09:02.701 --> 09:05.168
You're doing this...

09:05.170 --> 09:07.504
Don't do that here.
It's like this...

09:09.508 --> 09:10.940
Okay, let's try something else.

09:10.942 --> 09:12.609
I think you-you need
to slouch a little bit,

09:12.611 --> 09:14.043
'cause all these people
have back pain.

09:14.045 --> 09:15.445
Look, I'm sorry that
I have good posture.

09:15.447 --> 09:16.513
I'm not on my hands
and knees all day

09:16.515 --> 09:18.181
slapping hot tar on a roof.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.216
I'm sitting in an
ergonomic office chair

09:20.218 --> 09:21.518
like a frickin' gentleman.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.353
So, here's a way to give
a compliment.

09:23.355 --> 09:26.356
It's-- you insult somebody,
that's a way to show affection.

09:26.358 --> 09:28.024
Like, hey,
you ugly piece of crap,

09:28.026 --> 09:29.459
you got humongous ears.

09:29.461 --> 09:30.960
So you're too insecure
to show affection,

09:30.962 --> 09:33.196
so you do the opposite.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.531
And if you're ever in a pinch,
and the moment's getting

09:34.533 --> 09:36.199
on top of you,
just mention the game.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.300
(whispering):
You got this, man.

09:37.302 --> 09:38.735
You got this.

09:38.737 --> 09:40.370
Hey, what's up dum-dum?

09:40.372 --> 09:42.472
I'm sorry, I was breaking
so much balls before.

09:42.474 --> 09:44.908
I had a really stressful
day at the office.

09:44.910 --> 09:47.710
You know, the, uh, boss was
really giving it to me,

09:47.712 --> 09:49.746
so I kicked his ass,
but I'm better.

09:49.748 --> 09:52.382
Hey, uh,
I know how it goes, bud.

09:52.384 --> 09:55.051
So now that we have the
electrical,

09:55.053 --> 09:57.053
maybe we can get
started on the walls?

09:57.055 --> 09:58.555
Wh-what do you say, bud?

09:58.557 --> 10:00.223
Oh, uh, we're gonna have
to wait on the inspection.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.824
And that could take
a few months.

10:01.826 --> 10:03.560
A few months?!

10:03.562 --> 10:05.662
Any way we could speed
this process along?

10:05.664 --> 10:08.431
What do you say,
you dirty slut?
Slut?

10:08.433 --> 10:09.732
Look, this a city issue.

10:09.734 --> 10:10.934
But we could, uh,

10:10.936 --> 10:12.402
throw a little money
at the situation.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.836
See what we see.

10:13.838 --> 10:15.238
Throw a little bit of money,
see what we see.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.508
Who do I make the check
out to? Los Angeles?

10:18.510 --> 10:20.777
Or ma-make it to cash.
There you go.

10:20.779 --> 10:22.612
Yeah. All right.

10:22.614 --> 10:24.781
Now we're talking.
Ow!

10:24.783 --> 10:26.916
Caught a little bit
of my ween in there.
You all right?

10:26.918 --> 10:28.351
Just the tip, just
the tip of the ween.

10:28.353 --> 10:29.819
Okay.

10:31.523 --> 10:32.922
JESS:
Wow.

10:32.924 --> 10:35.191
Your house is amazing.

10:35.193 --> 10:36.793
Who lives here,
Vin Diesel?

10:36.795 --> 10:39.028
No. But we do
share a gardener.

10:39.030 --> 10:41.097
This is Stavros.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.266
He brought
homemade wine.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.935
Thank you, Stavros.
Looks, uh, very fresh.

10:45.937 --> 10:48.605
(Stavros speaking Greek)

10:48.607 --> 10:49.706
Is that right?

10:49.708 --> 10:51.774
Does he speak English?

10:51.776 --> 10:54.277
No. But his last name
has 17 consonants,

10:54.279 --> 10:56.980
which I find very charming.
Sure.

10:56.982 --> 10:58.214
So where's Babs?

10:58.216 --> 10:59.482
Putting her grandkids to bed?

10:59.484 --> 11:00.650
(chuckles)

11:00.652 --> 11:01.784
Hey.

11:01.786 --> 11:02.986
(gasps)

11:02.988 --> 11:05.288
I'm Babs.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.457
(chuckling):
This is gonna be fun.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.625
To life!

11:08.627 --> 11:11.461
This bottle's very warm.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.833
So, Babs, um, you work at
the factory with Robby?

11:16.835 --> 11:19.168
I'm the head engineer.
ROBBY: Babs is
a genius physicist.

11:19.170 --> 11:21.237
She got her doctorate
from Cambridge.

11:21.239 --> 11:22.639
Wow. I didn't...

11:22.641 --> 11:25.141
I mean, that's
very impressive.

11:25.143 --> 11:28.811
Stavros is from a rich
tradition of, uh, craftsman.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.481
Without men like him, we
wouldn't have houses to live in,

11:31.483 --> 11:33.349
or delicious wine
to drink with friends.

11:33.351 --> 11:34.651
(chuckling):
<i> Salud.</i>

11:34.653 --> 11:35.818
<i>Salud.</i>
<i> Yamas.</i>

11:35.820 --> 11:37.520
(all gagging, except Stavros)

11:37.522 --> 11:39.589
(choking):
Oh...

11:39.591 --> 11:41.591
It burns.
<i> Es</i> good?

11:41.593 --> 11:42.825
<i>Es</i> good.
<i> Es</i> good?
It's good.

11:44.429 --> 11:46.529
Is that a gold record
on your wall?
ROBBY: Hmm?

11:46.531 --> 11:49.432
Oh, yeah. I-I played bass
on a Santana album.

11:49.434 --> 11:51.000
Who are you?

11:51.002 --> 11:53.002
Yeah, there's...
there's no updates yet.

11:53.004 --> 11:56.005
I wonder how it's going.
Mm, mm, mm.

11:56.007 --> 11:57.440
Waiter has my credit card,

11:57.442 --> 11:59.175
in case we need to leave,
we're ready.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.677
Okay.
Yeah.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.345
Hey, let me ask
you something.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.547
You think we're too involved
in Robby and Jess?

12:04.549 --> 12:07.183
It could be argued that this
is a little unhealthy.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.686
Mm.
What does it really
say about us, you know?

12:09.688 --> 12:12.889
Are we just so bored with
our own lives now

12:12.891 --> 12:14.457
that we're settled and in love?

12:14.459 --> 12:16.392
Nah, that's not what's
happening here, okay?

12:16.394 --> 12:19.128
(laughing):
We're not bored.
Right.

12:19.130 --> 12:21.364
All right. I got a lot
of stuff going on.
Yeah.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.566
(whoops) Let me start
from the top.
Okay.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.034
Let me tell you, last week?
Yeah.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.370
I had ants in my room.

12:27.372 --> 12:30.306
Yeah. What else, what else,
what else, what else?

12:30.308 --> 12:32.475
Ooh, I think I'm gonna
try the crab breast.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.878
Did it.
Sure did.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.213
You know what's crazy?

12:37.215 --> 12:39.248
Not only did I get
Mr. Jason to respect me,

12:39.250 --> 12:41.884
but I think I learned to
respect him a little bit, too.

12:41.886 --> 12:45.321
I like the people;
so wild and lazy.

12:45.323 --> 12:47.056
If you want, I could take you
to the store I get my jeans.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.959
It's actually just a
Mexican supermarket.

12:51.730 --> 12:52.929
Give it to me.
I got it.

12:52.931 --> 12:55.665
Give it to me...
You okay?

12:55.667 --> 12:57.667
Give it to me.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.572
Look at the suds.

13:02.574 --> 13:04.273
You ruined a beer.

13:04.275 --> 13:05.608
SCHMIDT:
Ah, there he is.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.344
Hey-O.
Working late.

13:08.346 --> 13:09.579
So, Mr. Jason,
did we get the inspection,

13:09.581 --> 13:10.613
or are we gonna
keep waiting around

13:10.615 --> 13:12.415
like a couple of jamooks?

13:12.417 --> 13:15.752
Eh, threw some sawdust on the
puddle, but it's still wet.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.086
I don't know-- is that a
bad thing or good thing?

13:17.088 --> 13:18.087
Means he didn't get it.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.088
Hey, blame the city.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.690
I hate the city!

13:20.692 --> 13:22.258
Stup-stupid city.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.093
Well, you know what,
Mr. Jason? You tried.

13:24.095 --> 13:25.428
Thank you for that.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.196
I guess you can just
give us our money back.

13:27.198 --> 13:29.098
Oh, I don't have your money.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.466
We didn't get
the inspection, though.

13:30.468 --> 13:32.201
Well, I said
we'd see what we see.

13:32.203 --> 13:34.971
And this is what we saw...
You get it.

13:34.973 --> 13:36.939
I don't think that I do get it.
Do we get it, Nick?

13:36.941 --> 13:38.775
Do I, do I--
I don't get it.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.309
Do you get it?
I get it.

13:40.311 --> 13:42.478
Aren't those the copper pipes
for our bathroom?

13:42.480 --> 13:43.713
These are extra.

13:43.715 --> 13:44.814
I'm gonna use them
on another job.

13:44.816 --> 13:46.115
NICK:
Oh, at another job.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.617
Oh, it-- and he
left with them.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.285
What does he do?
I don't understand...

13:49.287 --> 13:50.486
Wh-what's happening?
Oh, I get it.
I get it.

13:50.488 --> 13:52.155
What is happening?
We got ripped off.

13:52.157 --> 13:55.057
God-- I knew it.
How did I not
see this coming?

13:55.059 --> 13:57.126
Maybe I've lost touch
with the people.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.128
Serves me right being
such a damn success.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.397
I'm sitting in my ivory
tower like Dan Brown!

14:01.399 --> 14:03.232
Nick, you're a very talented
writer, but you're no Dan Brown.

14:03.234 --> 14:04.834
You've never even
had anything published.

14:04.836 --> 14:06.335
Well, if I'm no Dan Brown,

14:06.337 --> 14:08.004
and I'm no man of the people,
then who am I?

14:08.006 --> 14:10.506
Stop having an identity crisis!
Now is not the time.

14:10.508 --> 14:12.508
What we need to do is
come up with a plan

14:12.510 --> 14:13.810
that combines both
of our strengths.
I like this.

14:13.812 --> 14:14.977
Here's what I'm thinking.

14:14.979 --> 14:18.147
We invite Mr. Jason over
for the game.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.316
And while I'm hosting
the hell out of him,

14:20.318 --> 14:22.985
you sneak down, and you steal
those pipes out of his truck.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.821
Let's do this, man!
Let's do this!
Nobody rips us off.

14:24.823 --> 14:28.024
Nobody rips us off!
Let's do it!

14:28.026 --> 14:31.661
I think what you wanted
to do was more like that.

14:31.663 --> 14:34.163
Why didn't mine break?

14:34.165 --> 14:37.400
It's really easy to
break it, you just...

14:40.205 --> 14:41.170
(grunting)

14:41.172 --> 14:42.371
Ten seconds.
Ten seconds.

14:42.373 --> 14:44.173
<i> Choiros.</i>
<i> Choiros chrimata!</i>

14:44.175 --> 14:45.341
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
<i> Choiros chrimata!</i>

14:45.343 --> 14:46.509
What does that mean?
I think, I think he's

14:46.511 --> 14:48.511
saying "pig money."
Is it pig money?

14:48.513 --> 14:49.345
Time!

14:49.347 --> 14:51.614
(laughter)
Hey.

14:51.616 --> 14:53.950
Well, it was piggy bank,
which is close enough.

14:53.952 --> 14:56.385
We gave you
"garbanzos" for "chick peas."

14:56.387 --> 14:58.688
I'm afraid
we cannot allow it, Jess.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.356
Man, we are wrecking you guys.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.024
It's probably
'cause me and Babs

15:02.026 --> 15:03.726
have, uh,
such a strong connection.

15:03.728 --> 15:06.529
Whatever. It's just 'cause
you speak the same language.

15:06.531 --> 15:09.365
I like to date people
that I can communicate with.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.133
Good for you.
Where's the wine?

15:11.135 --> 15:12.702
I like it now.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.370
I think it's making
me hallucinate.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.038
Mm-hmm. Me, too.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.140
You know what?
It's of good quality.

15:31.656 --> 15:35.892
¶ Last night I thought to back
when we made good love... ¶

15:35.894 --> 15:39.495
Oh, you're singing now?
¶ Listenin' to some
Marvin Gaye ¶

15:39.497 --> 15:41.597
¶ All night long... ¶

15:41.599 --> 15:43.599
(singing atonal
Greek folk song)

15:43.601 --> 15:47.670
(Jess sings along,
trying to copy him)

15:49.741 --> 15:52.842
(singing continues)

15:52.844 --> 15:55.278
¶ Good loving body rocking ¶

15:55.280 --> 15:56.946
¶ Knocking boots ¶
(Stavros and Jess sing)

15:56.948 --> 15:59.282
¶ All night long ¶
(Stavros and Jess singing)

15:59.284 --> 16:00.750
¶ All night long... ¶
Enough!

16:00.752 --> 16:03.085
What is wrong with you, Robby?

16:03.087 --> 16:04.420
What's wrong with me?

16:04.422 --> 16:05.588
You're the one who wanted
to see other people!

16:05.590 --> 16:06.956
I said I wanted
to take it slow.

16:06.958 --> 16:08.424
I didn't say
I want a front row seat

16:08.426 --> 16:10.760
to your date
with some movie scientist.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.428
This is a weird night.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.297
Well, welcome to my world, Babs.

16:14.299 --> 16:17.466
Jess, you don't know
what you want.

16:17.468 --> 16:19.802
I mean, do you like me?
Do you not like me?

16:19.804 --> 16:23.139
Are we in a relationship?
Are we not?

16:23.141 --> 16:24.140
(singing in Greek)

16:24.142 --> 16:25.474
Thank you, Stavros.
That'll do.

16:25.476 --> 16:27.610
I'm gonna go.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.779
(groans slightly)

16:29.781 --> 16:33.282
Yeah, well... I think
we should all go.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.284
(groans)

16:35.286 --> 16:37.820
Stavros, thank you for
the psychedelic wine,

16:37.822 --> 16:39.889
but I would like you
to leave my house now

16:39.891 --> 16:41.958
so that I can throw up.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.626
Jess, we go disco?

16:43.628 --> 16:46.462
¶ Nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz,
nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz ¶

16:46.464 --> 16:48.464
¶ Nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz ¶

16:48.466 --> 16:51.233
¶ Nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz,
nntz, nntz, nntz... ¶

16:55.073 --> 16:57.540
Maybe our lives
are boring.
Mm-hmm.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.011
Or... are we just happy?

17:02.013 --> 17:04.146
Follow me on this one.
Okay.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.482
Would you want
to be dating still?
Hell, no.

17:06.484 --> 17:08.651
Thank you.
I am happy!

17:08.653 --> 17:10.853
You know, and
happy-- sometimes

17:10.855 --> 17:12.822
it's a little bit
boring, but, you know,

17:12.824 --> 17:14.924
I have a great marriage,
and who needs the drama?
Mm-hmm.

17:14.926 --> 17:16.025
Not me.
No.

17:16.027 --> 17:17.493
As of right now,
I am washing

17:17.495 --> 17:19.829
my hands of all this
Jess and Robby nonsense.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.497
(phone whooshes)
I feel you.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.099
I'm out!
Jess just texted.
She needs us.

17:23.101 --> 17:25.034
I'm in! Let's go!
We're in!

17:25.036 --> 17:27.069
Okay, that slime ball
is on his way.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.772
Are you wearing
my jeans?
Yeah.

17:29.774 --> 17:31.874
I'm all mixed up, and
I can't get 'em off.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.709
That's 'cause they fit.
You look fantastic.

17:33.711 --> 17:36.445
If you get 'em wet,
I'm gonna flip out.
(knocking)

17:36.447 --> 17:38.247
Let's do this.

17:39.517 --> 17:42.184
Hey, hey, big game
for the boys, huh?

17:42.186 --> 17:45.721
Big games for the boys is right.
Mr. Jason, come on in.

17:45.723 --> 17:47.690
Ah. Nice.
Have a seat.
Nick, uh,

17:47.692 --> 17:48.724
want to go take care
of that thing?

17:48.726 --> 17:49.959
Oh, yeah, I got
to fix the boiler.

17:49.961 --> 17:50.860
Oh, gas or steam?

17:50.862 --> 17:53.396
Double?

17:53.398 --> 17:55.364
It's a, it's a double.
It sure is a double.

17:55.366 --> 17:58.300
Mr. Jason, it's good
to see you!
Thank you

17:58.302 --> 18:00.202
so much for having me over.
This is gonna be a good game.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.737
Are you hungry?
We've got some food.

18:01.739 --> 18:04.040
I've got sausages and brats,
all the sports meats.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.876
You know, I don't
eat meat. I'm a vegan.

18:06.878 --> 18:08.878
You...

18:08.880 --> 18:11.313
(loud metallic
clinking and clanking)

18:11.315 --> 18:14.717
(Nick grunting)

18:14.719 --> 18:16.318
Hey!

18:16.320 --> 18:19.388
It's not what it looks like,
Mr. Jason!

18:19.390 --> 18:22.825
It must be hard to order
as a vegan in a restaurant.
Oh!

18:22.827 --> 18:23.893
(indistinct chatter)

18:23.895 --> 18:26.562
(whoops)

18:26.564 --> 18:28.164
What is happening?

18:28.166 --> 18:29.231
What are we doing here?

18:29.233 --> 18:30.900
How was the date?
Tell us everything.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.568
Babs was a real catch,

18:32.570 --> 18:35.104
I drank too much
hallucinogenic wine,

18:35.106 --> 18:38.074
um, screwed everything up
with Robby,

18:38.076 --> 18:39.909
and now I'm at a... Greek rave.

18:39.911 --> 18:43.579
There's a rotisserie
in the back if you're hungry.

18:43.581 --> 18:44.747
Honey, what is this about?

18:44.749 --> 18:46.348
Are you really that scared
of getting hurt?

18:46.350 --> 18:47.583
I'm not afraid
of how it's gonna end.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.251
I'm afraid of how it started.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.087
Like, I've been so hesitant
from the beginning.

18:51.089 --> 18:53.122
Like, I need
to be convinced.

18:53.124 --> 18:55.524
Just, there's no love story
called<i> Hemming and Hawing.</i>

18:55.526 --> 18:57.093
WINSTON:
Actually, there is.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.361
Jose Canseco self-published
it on the Internet.

18:59.363 --> 19:01.430
It's about a lamb
that marries a CEO.

19:01.432 --> 19:02.431
CECE:
Jess, I think you should be

19:02.433 --> 19:04.100
having this conversation
with Robby.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.534
Or maybe I need

19:05.536 --> 19:07.470
to be having this conversation
with Robby!

19:07.472 --> 19:08.704
How much wine
have you had to drink?

19:08.706 --> 19:09.939
I don't know.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.874
It was in a soda bottle.
Look, don't stop me.

19:11.876 --> 19:13.275
I'm gonna go find Robby!
(Winston whistles)

19:13.277 --> 19:14.810
Uh...
ROBBY: Hi, uh, I'm looking

19:14.812 --> 19:17.446
for a girl named Jess!
She wears glasses.

19:17.448 --> 19:19.448
Kind of like this? I know
that's not a lot to go on,

19:19.450 --> 19:21.784
but the glasses are, like,
her-her whole thing really.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.152
He's here, he's here!
Robby?!

19:23.154 --> 19:24.620
Hey!
Cece! Winston!

19:24.622 --> 19:27.289
Hey!
I'm looking for Jess.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.991
Well, she's looking for you.
Yeah, she's looking for you.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.292
Really?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's...

19:30.294 --> 19:31.560
Yeah, she's about to leave.
I want to

19:31.562 --> 19:33.295
get out of this joint!
What's Greek for exit?

19:33.297 --> 19:36.132
Jess?!
Oh. Hi.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.399
Jess!
Robby!

19:37.401 --> 19:39.635
I don't want
to see other people.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.737
And also, I'm eating a falafel

19:41.739 --> 19:43.806
'cause I'm-I'm really,
really drunk.
I'm really

19:43.808 --> 19:45.674
drunk, too, and I don't want
to see anyone else, either.

19:45.676 --> 19:47.476
JESS:
It just got off to
such a rough start.

19:47.478 --> 19:48.844
I don't care how it started.

19:48.846 --> 19:51.747
I just care where
it goes. I like you.

19:51.749 --> 19:53.749
I like you, too!

19:53.751 --> 19:55.818
You're stealing my pipes?!
Unbelievable!

19:55.820 --> 19:58.320
You are breaking
my balls into oblivion!

19:58.322 --> 20:00.856
You broke my balls first. I got
a scrotum full of whipped cream.

20:00.858 --> 20:02.591
Oh!
You stole our money, man!

20:02.593 --> 20:03.993
I told you,
I tried to get the permit.

20:03.995 --> 20:05.427
It didn't work out.

20:05.429 --> 20:07.530
You got screwed over,
but I didn't do it.

20:07.532 --> 20:10.332
Then why did you take my pipes?
I bought 'em back to use
at another job.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.101
It's in your invoice!

20:12.103 --> 20:14.203
I actually saved you money!

20:14.205 --> 20:16.438
If that's true,
I am so thankful.

20:16.440 --> 20:17.940
That's really nice
of you, Mr. Jason.

20:17.942 --> 20:19.175
Thank you.
Yeah, great job.

20:19.177 --> 20:20.576
You're really good
contractor then.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.779
Mr. Jason?

20:23.781 --> 20:25.881
Are you...
are you crying?

20:25.883 --> 20:27.616
It's not easy
being a contractor.

20:27.618 --> 20:29.852
I'm always the bad guy.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.254
I just want to build
other people's dreams.

20:35.293 --> 20:37.026
Well, I feel like a buffoon.

20:37.028 --> 20:39.528
You know what, Mr. Jason?
We misjudged you.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.564
Big time.
And ourselves.

20:41.566 --> 20:43.632
If we hadn't been so
hung up on labels,

20:43.634 --> 20:45.968
we would've been able to see
each other for who we are.

20:45.970 --> 20:47.369
You're Mr. Jason.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.238
Call me Jason.
What's with the Mr. Jason?

20:49.240 --> 20:51.040
You're a vegan.
Get out.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.641
You know, it takes
53 gallons of water

20:52.643 --> 20:54.376
to produce
a single chicken egg?

20:54.378 --> 20:56.312
That's why!
Great!

20:56.314 --> 20:59.215
What do you say we hug it out?
All right.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.050
Oh, there you go.
There you go, Mr. Jason.
Hey.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.818
I don't usually do this.

21:02.820 --> 21:04.820
It's nice.
Yeah, it's nice.

21:04.822 --> 21:07.389
All right.
Oh. (clears his throat)
Oh, that's a tight squeeze.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.824
Oh, boy. Can't breathe!
Ooh, what a grip.

21:08.826 --> 21:10.726
You weren't actually
in Santana.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.161
You just met the band

21:12.163 --> 21:14.063
when you were delivering
pizza to the studio?

21:14.065 --> 21:15.898
Carlos found out
that I played bass somehow,

21:15.900 --> 21:17.399
and then he asked me
to sit in.
Huh.

21:17.401 --> 21:20.736
Thus began the brief career I
had as a studio session musician

21:20.738 --> 21:22.338
when I was a junior
in high school.

21:22.340 --> 21:25.107
I managed the girls
JV wrestling team.

21:25.109 --> 21:26.408
That's really cool, too.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.244
It was cool.

21:28.246 --> 21:29.445
Mm-hmm.

21:29.447 --> 21:30.913
Anyway, tell me literally

21:30.915 --> 21:32.448
everything that's
ever happened to you.

21:32.450 --> 21:34.250
You should just watch the
PBS special on me.
What?!

21:34.252 --> 21:35.918
I saved a guy's life.
What? Whose life?

21:35.920 --> 21:37.853
