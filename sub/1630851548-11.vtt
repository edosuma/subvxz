09:37.433 --> 09:37.633
[APPLAUSE]

09:37.700 --> 09:42.066
>> Bill: CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A

09:42.133 --> 09:44.500
REAL LEADER BECAUSE OUR SIZE,

09:44.566 --> 09:45.866
FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

09:45.933 --> 09:47.500
WORLD AND THIS NUMBER OF PEOPLE

09:47.566 --> 09:48.400
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES GIVES

09:48.466 --> 09:51.600
CALIFORNIA ENORMOUS POWER.

09:51.666 --> 09:55.266
WHICH WE HAVE MOSTLY USED FOR

09:55.333 --> 09:56.900
GOOD, LIKE EMISSIONS STANDARDS.

09:56.966 --> 09:57.533
YOU COULDN'T BUILD A CAR

09:57.600 --> 10:00.700
NATIONALLY IF YOU COULDN'T SELL

10:00.766 --> 10:01.866
IT IN THE CALIFORNIA MARKET.

10:01.933 --> 10:03.533
WHEN WE RAISED OUR ADMISSION

10:03.600 --> 10:05.600
STANDARDS, DETROIT HAD TO MAKE

10:05.666 --> 10:06.733
BETTER CARS, MORE

10:06.800 --> 10:07.333
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY CARS

10:07.400 --> 10:10.066
FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY.

10:10.133 --> 10:12.266
WHY CAN'T WE DO THAT FOR

10:12.333 --> 10:13.566
AGRICULTURE?

10:13.633 --> 10:15.233
FACTORY FARMING IS JUST AS BAD

10:15.300 --> 10:16.733
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AS

10:16.800 --> 10:20.100
AUTOMOBILES ARE.

10:20.166 --> 10:22.100
WE SEE FROM THIS PANDEMIC COME

10:22.166 --> 10:24.033
AS YOU TONIC DISEASES -- THIS

10:24.100 --> 10:25.300
WASN'T THE FIRST, IT WON'T BE

10:25.366 --> 10:27.500
THE LAST, WHEN IS IT GOING TO BE

10:27.566 --> 10:29.066
THE POLITICIAN THAT WILL TAKE ON

10:29.133 --> 10:30.266
BIG AGRICULTURE THE WAY SOME

10:30.333 --> 10:32.766
HAVE TAKEN ON THE AUTOMOBILE

10:32.833 --> 10:33.433
INDUSTRY?

10:33.500 --> 10:36.566
>> IT'S HAPPENED ALREADY, IT'S A

10:36.633 --> 10:37.200
COMBINATION OF CALIFORNIA TENDS

10:37.266 --> 10:39.066
TO LEAD THE WAY THROUGH STATE

10:39.133 --> 10:40.933
POLICY AND STATE LAWS AND

10:41.000 --> 10:42.033
EVENTUALLY IT RIPPLES TO THE

10:42.100 --> 10:45.400
NATIONAL LEVEL.

10:45.466 --> 10:48.033
SOMETIMES DESPITE THE IMPERFECT

10:48.100 --> 10:48.566
ELECTORAL COLLEGE AND U.S.

10:48.633 --> 10:52.500
SENATE, THE FILIBUSTER ET CETERA

10:52.566 --> 10:53.966
NEEDS TO GO, THERE'S AN

10:54.033 --> 10:54.633
OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE THE SIZE

10:54.700 --> 10:55.333
OF OUR STATE.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.866
IS NOT A COINCIDENCE WE ARE THE

10:56.933 --> 10:58.300
MOST POPULOUS STATE, THE MOST

10:58.366 --> 10:59.500
DIVERSE STATE, THE LARGEST

10:59.566 --> 11:00.533
ELECTORATE OF ANY STATE IN THE

11:00.600 --> 11:01.300
NATION, LARGEST ECONOMY IN EVERY

11:01.366 --> 11:06.733
STATE IN THE NATION, LEVERAGING

11:06.800 --> 11:08.266
THROUGH MARKET POWER, VEHICLE

11:08.333 --> 11:08.933
ADMISSION STANDARDS, IT'S GOING

11:09.000 --> 11:11.633
TO COME BACK.

11:11.700 --> 11:12.633
CALIFORNIA LEADS THE WAY, WE

11:12.700 --> 11:16.166
WILL DO IT FOR AGRICULTURE.

11:16.233 --> 11:18.333
>> Bill: WE WILL?

11:18.400 --> 11:19.333
FACTORY FARMING?

11:19.400 --> 11:21.633
>> IN DIFFERENT WAYS, ALREADY IN

11:21.700 --> 11:22.233
THE STATE LEVEL WE ARE

11:22.300 --> 11:24.766
INNOVATING AT CAPTURING

11:24.833 --> 11:26.700
OMISSIONS, THAT CAN BE CONVERTED

11:26.766 --> 11:29.866
TO ENERGY AS PART OF THE

11:29.933 --> 11:30.400
EVOLUTION OF THE INDUSTRY.

11:30.466 --> 11:31.300
>> Bill: WHAT ABOUT THE

11:31.366 --> 11:34.033
CRUELTY INVOLVED?

11:34.100 --> 11:35.666
WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO TORTURE

11:35.733 --> 11:37.333
THEM BEFORE WE EAT THEM, DO WE?

11:37.400 --> 11:40.266
>> NO.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.500
IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA LEADERS

11:41.566 --> 11:43.700
ALONE SPEAKING UP, MY GOOD

11:43.766 --> 11:44.600
FRIEND YOU MIGHT HAVE MET HIM,

11:44.666 --> 11:47.433
SENATOR CORY BOOKER HAS BEEN AN

11:47.500 --> 11:51.366
OUTSTANDING VOICE AND POLICY

11:51.433 --> 11:52.566
LEADER ON POINTING OUT

11:52.633 --> 11:54.166
INJUSTICES AND CRUELTY ON A LOT

11:54.233 --> 11:56.166
OF AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY, THE

11:56.233 --> 11:57.266
CORPORATIZATION OF IT'S NOT JUST

11:57.333 --> 11:58.133
IN THE UNITED STATES BUT WHAT

11:58.200 --> 11:59.866
HAS HAPPENED TO FAMILY FARMERS

11:59.933 --> 12:01.366
IN INDIA FOR EXAMPLE AND HOW

12:01.433 --> 12:05.566
MUCH MORE WORK WE NEED TO DO.

12:05.633 --> 12:09.900
[APPLAUSE]

12:09.966 --> 12:12.100
>> Bill: WHY DO YOU THINK

12:12.166 --> 12:13.133
TRUMP IN THE LAST ELECTION DID

12:13.200 --> 12:16.066
BETTER THAN HE DID IN THE FIRST

12:16.133 --> 12:18.500
ONE, AND BETTER WITH MINORITIES?

12:18.566 --> 12:20.433
>> IT'S A SCARY REMINDER.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.100
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE CELEBRATED

12:23.166 --> 12:25.300
THAT TRUMP IS BEHIND US BUT HE

12:25.366 --> 12:26.466
GOT MORE VOTES THAN ANY

12:26.533 --> 12:29.966
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT IN

12:30.033 --> 12:32.233
HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY EXCEPT

12:32.300 --> 12:34.400
FOR ONE -- THANKFULLY JOE BIDEN

12:34.466 --> 12:38.366
IN 2020.

12:38.433 --> 12:38.833
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

12:38.900 --> 12:40.433
THAT VICTORY HAS LOST OVER --

12:40.500 --> 12:44.666
HOW DID HE GET SO MANY VOTES,

12:44.733 --> 12:45.266
AND THE SOUTHERN TEXAS BORDER

12:45.333 --> 12:47.300
THAN HE DID IN THE FIRST

12:47.366 --> 12:47.566
ELECTION.

12:47.633 --> 12:48.800
AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT IT'S ALSO A

12:48.866 --> 12:52.733
REMINDER THAT DEMOCRATS CAN'T

12:52.800 --> 12:53.333
TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.566
WE GET CAUGHT UP IN THE NATIONAL

12:55.633 --> 12:56.900
MESSAGING AND BIG PICTURE ISSUES

12:56.966 --> 13:00.466
BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE AND

13:00.533 --> 13:02.133
CANDIDATES AT THE FEDERAL,

13:02.200 --> 13:03.766
STATE, AND LOCAL LEVEL CAN'T

13:03.833 --> 13:05.633
FORGET TO CONNECT WITH VOTERS

13:05.700 --> 13:07.300
LOCALLY AND HOW WE ARE

13:07.366 --> 13:07.666
COMMUNICATING.

13:07.733 --> 13:09.066
>> Bill: DO YOU KNOW

13:09.133 --> 13:10.300
CONGRESSMAN RUBEN GALLEGO IN

13:10.366 --> 13:10.533
ARIZONA?

13:10.600 --> 13:13.233
>> WE'VE MET, ABSOLUTELY.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.100
>> Bill: HE WAS ASKED AFTER

13:15.166 --> 13:16.600
THE ELECTION WHAT CAN DEMOCRATS

13:16.666 --> 13:17.900
DO BETTER TO CONNECT TO LATINO

13:17.966 --> 13:20.000
VOTERS AND HE SAID "YOU CAN

13:20.066 --> 13:26.500
START BY NOT SAYING LATINX."

13:26.566 --> 13:27.433
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M SAYING IT

13:27.500 --> 13:28.900
CORRECTLY.

13:28.966 --> 13:29.966
IF WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT

13:30.033 --> 13:34.900
COMMENT FROM HIM?

13:34.966 --> 13:36.733
>> THAT'S HIS OPINION COME I

13:36.800 --> 13:38.900
RESPECTED HIM I DON'T COMPLETELY

13:38.966 --> 13:39.700
AGREE.

13:39.766 --> 13:40.833
HEARING HIM SAY IT JUST BRINGS

13:40.900 --> 13:43.900
ME BACK TWO YEARS AND YEARS OF

13:43.966 --> 13:46.300
DEBATE OF HISPANIC VERSUS LATINO

13:46.366 --> 13:47.000
VERSUS CHICANO VERSUS

13:47.066 --> 13:47.633
MEXICAN-AMERICAN, WE GET CAUGHT

13:47.700 --> 13:48.700
UP IN THE TERMINOLOGY AND IT

13:48.766 --> 13:52.133
COMES ACROSS AT DIFFERENT WAYS

13:52.200 --> 13:52.933
TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT

13:53.000 --> 13:55.166
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

13:55.233 --> 13:59.833
LATINX FOR THE YOUNGER

13:59.900 --> 14:03.766
GENERATION, IT'S MORE THAN JUST

14:03.833 --> 14:05.833
SYMBOLIC, AND THE

14:05.900 --> 14:06.466
SPANISH-LANGUAGE HAVE FEMININE

14:06.533 --> 14:10.000
VERSUS MASCULINE, NOW THE MOVE

14:10.066 --> 14:11.933
TO LATINX IS ONE WAY IF WE ARE

14:12.000 --> 14:14.166
ALL EQUAL LET'S LET OUR LANGUAGE

14:14.233 --> 14:14.666
REFLECT THAT.

14:14.733 --> 14:16.200
>> Bill: I THINK HE WAS SAYING

14:16.266 --> 14:18.366
THAT BECAUSE HIS POLLING SHOWED

14:18.433 --> 14:20.700
THAT MOST LATINX PEOPLE EITHER

14:20.766 --> 14:21.566
DON'T KNOW THE TERM OR WHEN THEY

14:21.633 --> 14:25.166
HEAR IT THEY DON'T LIKE IT.

14:25.233 --> 14:27.133
>> IT'S RELATIVELY NEW FOR SOME

14:27.200 --> 14:28.233
BUT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THE

14:28.300 --> 14:30.800
CROSS TABS IF YOU WILL COME

14:30.866 --> 14:31.666
UNDERLYING DATA IN THE POLLING

14:31.733 --> 14:33.000
FOR OLDER VOTERS MAY BE NOT

14:33.066 --> 14:34.400
NEARLY AS POPULAR BUT FOR

14:34.466 --> 14:35.600
YOUNGER VOTERS WHICH IS THE

14:35.666 --> 14:38.000
GROWING PART OF THE LATINO

14:38.066 --> 14:40.133
ELECTORATES, THEY EMBRACE IT.

14:40.200 --> 14:47.033
[APPLAUSE]

14:47.100 --> 14:49.200
>> Bill: VERY WOKE CROWD

14:49.266 --> 14:50.200
TONIGHT.

14:50.266 --> 14:51.466
IT'S GOING TO BE A ROUGH FUCKING

14:51.533 --> 14:56.566
SHOW COMING UP FOR YOU PEOPLE.

14:56.633 --> 14:57.133
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

14:57.200 --> 15:00.366
I'M KIDDING.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.000
WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE SAY A CRISIS

15:02.066 --> 15:03.600
AT THE BORDER, THEY HAVE

15:03.666 --> 15:05.233
APPREHENDED MORE PEOPLE THAN

15:05.300 --> 15:07.433
THEY HAVE FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS

15:07.500 --> 15:09.066
RECENTLY BUT IT'S A SEASONAL, WE

15:09.133 --> 15:12.466
ALSO KNOW THAT.

15:12.533 --> 15:14.633
WHAT IS THE CORRECT PERCENTAGE

15:14.700 --> 15:16.666
OR AMOUNT DO YOU THINK OF

15:16.733 --> 15:16.966
IMMIGRATION?

15:17.033 --> 15:21.300
IS THERE A NUMBER, THE PERSON

15:21.366 --> 15:22.500
WHO SAYS THE HIGHEST NUMBER

15:22.566 --> 15:25.966
POSSIBLE IS HE THE BETTER PERSO

15:26.033 --> 15:26.200
PERSON?

15:26.266 --> 15:28.166
OR IS IT SOMETHING WE CAN APPLY

15:28.233 --> 15:28.500
MORE LOGIC TO.

15:28.566 --> 15:31.333
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A

15:31.400 --> 15:32.200
PRECISE NUMBER OR PERCENTAGE,

15:32.266 --> 15:33.500
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THROUGHOUT

15:33.566 --> 15:35.833
THE COURSE OF OUR HISTORY AS A

15:35.900 --> 15:37.300
COUNTRY, WAVES OF IMMIGRANTS

15:37.366 --> 15:38.433
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE LED

15:38.500 --> 15:41.233
TO OUR STRENGTH AS A COUNTRY,

15:41.300 --> 15:42.433
NOT JUST A GROWING POPULATION

15:42.500 --> 15:44.233
BUT A GROWING ECONOMY AND OF THE

15:44.300 --> 15:47.266
STRENGTH OF OUR IMPERFECT

15:47.333 --> 15:47.866
DEMOCRACY -- I APPRECIATE THE

15:47.933 --> 15:50.466
FACT THAT YOU RECOGNIZE IT'S A

15:50.533 --> 15:51.866
SEASONAL UPTICK IN THE NUMBERS.

15:51.933 --> 15:54.633
SOME YEARS IS A BIGGER UPTICK,

15:54.700 --> 15:57.133
SOME YEARS IT'S NOT AS BIG OF AN

15:57.200 --> 15:57.400
INCREASE.

15:57.466 --> 15:59.766
RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT JUST AN

15:59.833 --> 16:01.400
INCREASED NUMBER OF FAMILIES, A

16:01.466 --> 16:02.933
LOT OF UNACCOMPANIED MINORS

16:03.000 --> 16:05.333
SHOWING UP AT THE BORDER BUT THE

16:05.400 --> 16:07.533
CONSEQUENCES OF STARVING THE

16:07.600 --> 16:08.433
VERY AGENCIES THAT PROCESS

16:08.500 --> 16:09.000
ASYLUM-SEEKERS.

16:09.066 --> 16:09.900
LET'S BE CLEAR AS TO WHO THESE

16:09.966 --> 16:11.833
KIDS ARE.

16:11.900 --> 16:15.633
IT'S NOT RAPISTS, IT'S NOT

16:15.700 --> 16:17.633
DRUG DEALERS, IT'S

16:17.700 --> 16:20.166
ASYLUM-SEEKERS FLEEING NATURAL

16:20.233 --> 16:21.366
DISASTERS AND POVERTY, VIOLENCE,

16:21.433 --> 16:22.033
THEY ARE LITERALLY RUNNING FOR

16:22.100 --> 16:23.400
THEIR LIVES AND THEY DESERVE TO

16:23.466 --> 16:27.400
BE TREATED HUMANELY.

16:27.466 --> 16:29.400
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

16:29.466 --> 16:32.733
>> Bill: I AGREE WITH ALL THAT

16:32.800 --> 16:32.933
THAT.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.766
DOESN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION.

16:34.833 --> 16:38.366
>> I KNOW, BUT BY THE WAY.

16:38.433 --> 16:41.766
WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS THIS

16:41.833 --> 16:42.400
SPRING, IT'S A GROUP SEPARATE

16:42.466 --> 16:43.200
AND APART.

16:43.266 --> 16:45.766
LET'S NOT BE DISTRACTED BY THEM

16:45.833 --> 16:50.566
AND NOT GET DONE THE JUSTICE FOR

16:50.633 --> 16:52.333
THE 11 MILLION CURRENTLY LIVING

16:52.400 --> 16:53.066
IN THE UNITED STATES,

16:53.133 --> 16:53.933
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WHAT

16:54.000 --> 16:55.866
THEY NEED IN TERMS OF SECURITY

16:55.933 --> 16:58.433
AND PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.133
MY FIRST BILL INTRODUCED IN THE

17:00.200 --> 17:01.233
UNITED STATES SENATE WOULD OFFER

17:01.300 --> 17:02.566
A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR ALL

17:02.633 --> 17:05.500
NONCITIZEN ESSENTIAL WORKERS

17:05.566 --> 17:06.533
THAT HAVE BEEN SACRIFICING AND

17:06.600 --> 17:07.900
SERVING THE REST OF US

17:07.966 --> 17:10.366
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THIS

PANDEMIC.

17:13.200 --> 17:13.766
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

17:13.833 --> 17:15.100
>> Bill: FINAL QUESTION, LOOKS

17:15.166 --> 17:16.400
LIKE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A

17:16.466 --> 17:18.600
RECALL OF THE GOVERNOR OF THIS

17:18.666 --> 17:20.500
STATE, THIS IS INSANITY, ONE OF

17:20.566 --> 17:21.233
THOSE STUPID THINGS CALIFORNIA

17:21.300 --> 17:23.000
DOES, WE ACTUALLY HAVE TOO MUCH

17:23.066 --> 17:24.600
DEMOCRACY IN THIS STATE.

17:24.666 --> 17:26.433
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO VOTE ON

17:26.500 --> 17:28.633
EVERYTHING, WE HAVE TOO MANY

17:28.700 --> 17:29.400
PROPOSITIONS, DIALYSIS MACHINES,

17:29.466 --> 17:31.400
WHY MY VOTING ON THIS EVERY TWO

17:31.466 --> 17:31.700
YEARS?

17:31.766 --> 17:34.233
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE ISSUE

17:34.300 --> 17:35.000
IS WITH DIALYSIS MACHINES BUT

17:35.066 --> 17:36.300
IT'S ON THE BALLOT EVERY YEAR.

17:36.366 --> 17:38.166
WE'VE GOT TO STOP THIS, WE

17:38.233 --> 17:40.666
SHOULD NOT BE RECALLING THIS

17:40.733 --> 17:43.300
GOVERNOR.

17:43.366 --> 17:44.733
>> I AGREE COMPLETELY.

17:44.800 --> 17:45.933

17:46.000 --> 17:47.766
CIRCUS I REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS

17:47.833 --> 17:48.833
LAST TIME, EVERY UNEMPLOYED

17:48.900 --> 17:51.766
ACTOR IN THE STATE IS GOING TO

17:51.833 --> 17:53.266
BE RUNNING, CAITLYN JENNER IS

17:53.333 --> 17:53.500
RUNNING!

17:53.566 --> 17:54.500
>> AGAIN, WHAT'S THE RIGHT

17:54.566 --> 17:56.800
NUMBER, IS IT TOO MUCH OR TOO

17:56.866 --> 17:58.900
LITTLE, I ERR ON THE SIDE OF TOO

17:58.966 --> 17:59.566
MUCH.

17:59.633 --> 18:00.366
HERE IS THE HYPOCRISY OF IT AND

18:00.433 --> 18:05.066
WHAT REALLY PISSES ME OFF, THE

18:05.133 --> 18:06.166
SAME REPUBLICAN FORCES THAT

18:06.233 --> 18:07.133
REFUSED TO HOLD TRUMP

18:07.200 --> 18:08.133
ACCOUNTABLE OVER THE COURSE OF

18:08.200 --> 18:10.000
FOUR YEARS OR EVEN FOR THE

18:10.066 --> 18:11.800
INSURRECTION IN JANUARY 6TH ARE

18:11.866 --> 18:13.933
NOW SETTING THEIR SIGHTS ON

18:14.000 --> 18:15.333
GOVERNOR NEWSOM BECAUSE OF THE

18:15.400 --> 18:16.033
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S FAILURES

18:16.100 --> 18:17.200
TO RESPOND TO COVID EARLIER IN

18:17.266 --> 18:20.700
THE PANDEMIC, GIVE ME A BREAK.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.166
>> Bill: THANKS,

18:21.233 --> 18:25.966
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW JOB.

18:26.033 --> 18:29.300
LET'S MEET OUR PANEL.

18:29.366 --> 18:32.100
HOW ARE YOU?

18:32.166 --> 18:33.366
SHE'S THE AUTHOR OF THE NEW YORK

18:33.433 --> 18:34.233
TIMES BESTSELLER "THE SUM OF US:

18:34.300 --> 18:34.866
WHAT RACISM COSTS EVERYONE AND

18:34.933 --> 18:36.133
HOW WE CAN PROSPER TOGETHER":

18:36.200 --> 18:41.100
HEATHER MCGHEE.

18:41.166 --> 18:43.533
BACK WITH US.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.366
HE'S PRESIDENT OF THE MANHATTAN

18:44.433 --> 18:45.033
INSTITUTE AND A CONTRIBUTING

18:45.100 --> 18:45.766
WRITER AT THE ATLANTIC: REIHAN

18:45.833 --> 18:50.166
SALAM.

18:50.233 --> 18:52.333
OUR RETURNING CHAMPION, HOW ARE

18:52.400 --> 18:56.666
YOU?

18:56.733 --> 18:57.633
I'M IN A PRETTY GOOD MOOD

18:57.700 --> 18:58.466
TONIGHT I HAVE TO TELL YOU

18:58.533 --> 19:00.633
BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

19:00.700 --> 19:02.966
OVER A YEAR, I GOT BOOKED ON THE

19:03.033 --> 19:06.800
ROAD AGAIN, BACK ON THE ROAD.

19:06.866 --> 19:08.033
[APPLAUSE]

19:08.100 --> 19:09.000
I KNOW, LIFE RETURNING.

19:09.066 --> 19:11.033
I'LL BE BACK AT THE MIRAGE IN

19:11.100 --> 19:12.266
LAS VEGAS IN JULY, I'M SO HAPPY

19:12.333 --> 19:15.233
I WILL BE ABLE TO BORE YOU AGAIN

19:15.300 --> 19:18.100
WITH WHERE I'M GOING OVER THE

19:18.166 --> 19:18.366
WEEKEND.

19:18.433 --> 19:22.400
"I'LL BE IN CINCINNATI!"

19:22.466 --> 19:25.266
PLEASE, JESUS, LET THAT HAPPEN.

19:25.333 --> 19:30.266
WHAT A TO MAKE ONE OF THE

19:30.333 --> 19:31.966
UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS OF THE

19:32.033 --> 19:32.566
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AS HE'S

19:32.633 --> 19:34.366
TURNING OUT TO BE MORE RADICAL

19:34.433 --> 19:35.600
THAN THE GUY HE SERVED AS

19:35.666 --> 19:36.566
VICE PRESIDENT, NO ONE CAN SAY

19:36.633 --> 19:38.666
HE'S NOT GOING BIG.

19:38.733 --> 19:41.466
GO BIG OR GO HOME, HE'S DOING

19:41.533 --> 19:42.100
IT.

19:42.166 --> 19:44.666
IT TURNS OUT HIS NEW BUDGET,

19:44.733 --> 19:46.566
1.5, 2 TRILLION -- IT'S NOTHING

19:46.633 --> 19:50.533
TO THIS GUY.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.900
HE ALWAYS WON AT THE HUSTLER

19:54.966 --> 19:57.733
CASINO -- BUT I THINK TRUST IN

19:57.800 --> 19:58.500
GOVERNMENT IS THE BIG ISSUE HE'S

19:58.566 --> 19:59.100
GOING TO FACE BECAUSE IF YOU

19:59.166 --> 20:01.566
WANT TO DO BIG THINGS PEOPLE ARE

20:01.633 --> 20:03.166
GOING TO ASK AND YOU DO THEM

20:03.233 --> 20:03.900
WELL.

20:03.966 --> 20:04.766
CAN YOU DO THEM WITHOUT WASTING

20:04.833 --> 20:07.866
ALL OUR MONEY -- SHOULD WE TRUST

20:07.933 --> 20:08.766
GOVERNMENT TO DO SOMETHING ON

20:08.833 --> 20:12.966
THE SCALE THAT HE IS SUGGESTING

20:13.033 --> 20:13.933
WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM

20:14.000 --> 20:15.666
AND WHEN I SAY INFRASTRUCTURE

20:15.733 --> 20:16.266
THAT ENCOMPASSES ANYTHING YOU

20:16.333 --> 20:21.566
WANT TO PUT UNDER THAT TITLE.

20:21.633 --> 20:22.500
IT'S $3 TRILLION, SHOULD WE

20:22.566 --> 20:23.866
TRUST GOVERNMENT WITH THAT KIND

20:23.933 --> 20:24.100
OF CASH?

20:24.166 --> 20:26.633
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO BECAUSE

20:26.700 --> 20:27.233
WE'VE BEEN STARVING OURSELVES

20:27.300 --> 20:29.400
FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS.

20:29.466 --> 20:30.866
THE DEFINITION OF INFRASTRUCTURE

20:30.933 --> 20:33.900
REALLY SHOULD BE THE THINGS WE

20:33.966 --> 20:37.100
NEED TO MAKE ALL OF THEIR WORK

20:37.166 --> 20:39.566
AND ALL OTHER PRODUCTIVITY

20:39.633 --> 20:40.366
POSSIBLE.

20:40.433 --> 20:42.500
IT SUPPORTS AND BRIDGES BUT ALSO

20:42.566 --> 20:44.033
AS WE LEARNED DURING THE

20:44.100 --> 20:45.833
PANDEMIC OF CHILD CARE AND

20:45.900 --> 20:47.000
ELDERCARE END OF THE KINDS OF

20:47.066 --> 20:48.600
THINGS THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR

20:48.666 --> 20:49.866
A MECHANIC AND A SMALL TOWN TO

20:49.933 --> 20:52.133
FIX A CARBURETOR BECAUSE THEY

20:52.200 --> 20:54.133
ACTUALLY NEED RURAL BROADBAND.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.400
ALL OF THOSE THINGS NEED TO BE

20:55.466 --> 20:56.800
THOUGHT OF AS INFRASTRUCTURE.

20:56.866 --> 20:57.800
THE THING I'M MOST EXCITED ABOUT

20:57.866 --> 20:59.433
IS RIPPING UP ALL THE LEAD PIPES

20:59.500 --> 21:00.866
IN THE COUNTRIES OF THE PARENTS

21:00.933 --> 21:02.966
AND HAVE TO WORRY THAT THEY'RE

21:03.033 --> 21:03.433
GIVING THEIR CHILDREN

21:03.500 --> 21:06.166
DISABILITIES BY TURNING ON THE

21:06.233 --> 21:07.733
TAP.

21:07.800 --> 21:08.133
>> Bill: RIGHT.

21:08.200 --> 21:08.600
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

21:08.666 --> 21:09.900
>> THESE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS

21:09.966 --> 21:11.733
THAT ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE

21:11.800 --> 21:13.066
NO-BRAINERS IN A COUNTRY WITH

21:13.133 --> 21:14.566
THE LARGEST ECONOMY ON EARTH.

21:14.633 --> 21:15.633
TO THE QUESTION OF TRUST IN

21:15.700 --> 21:18.966
GOVERNMENT, I THINK IT'S REAL.

21:19.033 --> 21:21.633
WE HAVE SO LET POOR SERVICES FOR

21:21.700 --> 21:23.533
THE POOR BE WHAT EXACTLY WE'VE

21:23.600 --> 21:24.666
COME TO EXPECT FROM THE

21:24.733 --> 21:25.833
GOVERNMENT AND I'M SOMEONE WHO

21:25.900 --> 21:28.066
COMES TO BELIEVE IN THE POWER

21:28.133 --> 21:29.933
AND POSSIBILITY AND NECESSITY OF

21:30.000 --> 21:30.933
DOING TOGETHER WHAT WE SIMPLY

21:31.000 --> 21:32.233
CAN'T DO ON OUR OWN AND WE HAVE

21:32.300 --> 21:35.100
TO HOLD GOVERNMENT TO THE

21:35.166 --> 21:36.200
HIGHEST POSSIBLE STANDARD.

21:36.266 --> 21:38.166
HOPEFULLY YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BE

21:38.233 --> 21:39.266
DESIGNING PUBLIC GOODS AND

21:39.333 --> 21:40.800
SERVICES AND NOT PHOTO SHARING

21:40.866 --> 21:42.000
APPS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN WHAT

21:42.066 --> 21:44.233
WE CAN DO TOGETHER, RIGHT?

21:44.300 --> 21:46.033
THAT'S THE GOAL.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.266
>> Bill: YOU ARE A DREAMER.

21:48.333 --> 21:48.733
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

21:48.800 --> 21:49.033
>> I AM.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.366
>> Bill: THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

21:50.433 --> 21:53.200
>> ONE WAY I STRONGLY AGREE WITH

21:53.266 --> 21:54.600
HEATHER IS WE AUTO HOLD

21:54.666 --> 21:56.033
GOVERNMENT TO HIGH STANDARDS AND

21:56.100 --> 21:57.666
WE HOLD GOVERNMENT TO

21:57.733 --> 21:58.400
EXCEPTIONALLY LOW STANDARDS.

21:58.466 --> 21:58.933
THE UNITED STATES IS NOT A

21:59.000 --> 22:00.466
COUNTRY THAT DOES NOT SPEND VERY

22:00.533 --> 22:01.766
MUCH, IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT

22:01.833 --> 22:02.866
STATE GOVERNMENTS FOR EXAMPLE

22:02.933 --> 22:05.733
YOU HAD 30 YEARS OF

22:05.800 --> 22:06.300
SELF-DESCRIBED CONSERVATIVE

22:06.366 --> 22:08.133
REPUBLICANS IN STATE AFTER

22:08.200 --> 22:09.633
STATE, THEY DON'T SPEND

22:09.700 --> 22:10.133
SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN

22:10.200 --> 22:10.400
DEMOCRATS.

22:10.466 --> 22:12.066
THEY MOVE IN EXACTLY THE SAME

22:12.133 --> 22:16.700
DIRECTION AND YOU SEE TIME AND

22:16.766 --> 22:18.166
AGAIN, VERY EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT

22:18.233 --> 22:20.766
SERVICES DELIVERING INCREDIBLY

22:20.833 --> 22:22.400
LOW QUALITY SERVICES TO PEOPLE

22:22.466 --> 22:23.033
WHO NEED THEM.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.500
I THINK ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING

22:24.566 --> 22:27.100
AT THIS IS THE IDEA THAT

22:27.166 --> 22:28.633
GOVERNMENT, WE SHOULD DEMAND

22:28.700 --> 22:31.600
MORE FROM IT, WE SHOULD EXPECT

22:31.666 --> 22:33.500
TO DO MORE WITHIN THEIR MEANS.

22:33.566 --> 22:35.433
WHAT YOU ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW

22:35.500 --> 22:36.933
DESCRIBING PRESIDENT BIDEN, YOU

22:37.000 --> 22:38.166
SEE THIS MOMENT WHERE PEOPLE ARE

22:38.233 --> 22:41.700
PRETENDING THERE ARE NO LIMITS.

22:41.766 --> 22:42.700
LITERALLY IF PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD

22:42.766 --> 22:44.400
DONE NOTHING OVER THE NEXT 30

22:44.466 --> 22:46.100
YEARS WE WOULD HAVE SEEN

22:46.166 --> 22:48.933
$100 TRILLION IN ADDITIONAL

22:49.033 --> 22:50.533
FEDERAL DEBT OVER THE NEXT 30

22:50.600 --> 22:51.233
YEARS.

22:51.300 --> 22:54.333
HE SAID LET'S SPEND ANOTHER

22:54.400 --> 22:55.233
11 TRILLION, HE SAID WE ALSO ARE

22:55.300 --> 22:56.800
GOING TO INCREASE TAXES BY

22:56.866 --> 22:59.266
$3 TRILLION, BUT THAT'S AGAINST

22:59.333 --> 23:01.900
AN INCREASE IN DEBT OF WELL OVER

23:01.966 --> 23:02.466
100 TRILLION.

23:02.533 --> 23:03.833
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT GOVERNMENT,

23:03.900 --> 23:05.000
WHETHER OR NOT WE BELIEVE IN IT,

23:05.066 --> 23:07.200
THE TRUE TEST IS WHETHER OR NOT

23:07.266 --> 23:08.500
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY WILLING TO

23:08.566 --> 23:08.800
PAY.

23:08.866 --> 23:10.900
WE ARE IN THIS MOMENT OF

23:10.966 --> 23:12.333
SUSPENDED ANIMATION WHERE WE ARE

23:12.400 --> 23:13.300
PRETENDING WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY.

23:13.366 --> 23:15.933
IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER DEMOCRACIES

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
THAT DELIVER HIGHER QUALITY

23:17.066 --> 23:18.133
SERVICES, THAT ACTUALLY ARE MORE

23:18.200 --> 23:19.666
EFFICIENT WHEN IT COMES TO

23:19.733 --> 23:20.266
GOVERNMENT, THEY DO SOMETHING

23:20.333 --> 23:23.100
REALLY CRAZY.

23:23.166 --> 23:24.800
THEY SPEND AND THEN THEY TAX

23:24.866 --> 23:25.933
SPIRIT OF WHAT THEY SAY IS WE

23:26.000 --> 23:28.500
ARE GOING TO TAKE MONEY FROM YOU

23:28.566 --> 23:30.533
THIS TIME, WE ARE GOING TO GET

23:30.600 --> 23:32.166
THE MONEY TO YOU ANOTHER TIME,

23:32.233 --> 23:33.566
BUT THAT'S HOW YOU SEE PEOPLE

23:33.633 --> 23:35.233
BELIEVE IN IT, THEY ARE WILLING

23:35.300 --> 23:36.233
TO PAY THE PIPER.

23:36.300 --> 23:37.633
WE ARE IN THIS MOMENT OF FANTASY

23:37.700 --> 23:40.400
POLITICS AND IT WAS TRUE UNDER

23:40.466 --> 23:41.400
PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT'S TRUE UNDER

23:41.466 --> 23:43.266
PRESIDENT BIDEN, TURNED UP TO 11

23:43.333 --> 23:45.666
WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO PRETEND WE

23:45.733 --> 23:48.766
DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO SEE TO IT

23:48.833 --> 23:49.566
THAT THE RESOURCES ARE ACTUALLY

23:49.633 --> 23:51.700
THERE.

23:51.766 --> 23:53.366
THAT GROWS EFFICIENCY AND THIS

23:53.433 --> 23:55.566
LACK OF SCRUTINY WHICH IS REALLY

23:55.633 --> 23:56.433
DANGEROUS.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.233
[APPLAUSE]

23:58.300 --> 23:58.900
SPEAK OF THE MAJORITY OF

23:58.966 --> 24:00.400
AMERICANS WANT THERE TO BE

24:00.466 --> 24:01.600
HIGHER TAXES ON THE WEALTHY

24:01.666 --> 24:02.466
PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY KNOW IT'S

24:02.533 --> 24:03.500
GOING TO BE USED TO TAKE CARE OF

24:03.566 --> 24:05.033
A PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN A

24:05.100 --> 24:06.400
PROBLEM FOR AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN

24:06.466 --> 24:10.333
ALIVE, THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE

24:10.400 --> 24:11.333
FAILED TO ATTEND TO OUR BASIC

24:11.400 --> 24:13.366
NEEDS IN THE COUNTRY.

24:13.433 --> 24:15.566
IN MY BOOK I WROTE ABOUT THIS

24:15.633 --> 24:16.166
PHENOMENON THAT HAPPENED WHERE

24:16.233 --> 24:17.966
WE USED TO BUILD THINGS IN

24:18.033 --> 24:19.166
AMERICA, DONALD TRUMP WASN'T

24:19.233 --> 24:20.566
WRONG ABOUT THAT.

24:20.633 --> 24:21.233
NOSTALGIA FOR AN AMERICA THAT

24:21.300 --> 24:23.033
PUT THE MAN ON THE MOON AND

24:23.100 --> 24:24.933
BUILT THE HOOVER DAM ON THE

24:25.000 --> 24:26.366
HIGHWAY SYSTEM, THAT UNITES

24:26.433 --> 24:27.666
PEOPLE OF ALL BACKGROUNDS IN

24:27.733 --> 24:29.733
THIS COUNTRY, THE SENSE OF

24:29.800 --> 24:30.200
AMERICAN GREATNESS.

24:30.266 --> 24:31.433
A BIG PART OF IT WAS THIS EAT

24:31.500 --> 24:32.833
THOSE THAT SAYS WE ARE GOING TO

24:32.900 --> 24:34.533
TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE.

24:34.600 --> 24:38.333
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A HIGHER

24:38.400 --> 24:40.966
STANDARD OF LIVING, THAT WAS

24:41.033 --> 24:41.800
ABOUT PUBLIC AMENITIES, PUBLIC

24:41.866 --> 24:43.366
GOODS, PUBLIC SERVICES.

24:43.433 --> 24:45.666
IF I TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC POOLS

24:45.733 --> 24:48.133
WE USED TO HAVE, NEARLY 2,000 OF

24:48.200 --> 24:48.900
THEM IN THIS COUNTRY.

24:48.966 --> 24:49.900
>> Bill: AND SWIMMING POOLS.

24:49.966 --> 24:52.533
>> NOT A BIG DEAL, MAYBE.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.533
>> Bill: WE HAVE ONE IN MY

24:54.600 --> 24:56.433
TOWN, IT WAS A HOLE IN THE

24:56.500 --> 24:59.066
GROUND, IT WAS JUST SAND, IT WAS

24:59.133 --> 25:00.300
SHITTY, BUT WE LOVED IT.

25:00.366 --> 25:02.466
IT WAS A BIG THING WHEN IT CAME

25:02.533 --> 25:02.700
TO TOWN.

25:02.766 --> 25:05.266
>> IT WAS, THERE WERE ALMOST

25:05.333 --> 25:06.433
2,000 OF THEM IN THE COUNTRY AND

25:06.500 --> 25:08.233
IN A LOT OF PLACES IN THE

25:08.300 --> 25:09.300
COUNTRY THEY WERE SEGREGATED.

25:09.366 --> 25:13.033
WHEN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT

25:13.100 --> 25:14.200
ALLOWED BLACK FAMILIES TO SAY

25:14.266 --> 25:19.466
THOSE ARE OUR TAX DOLLARS, WHAT

25:19.533 --> 25:23.033
TOWN AFTER TOWN DID WAS DRAIN

25:23.100 --> 25:24.400
THE PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL RATHER

25:24.466 --> 25:25.766
THAN INTEGRATED.

25:25.833 --> 25:27.300
YOU SAW A TURN AWAY FROM THE

25:27.366 --> 25:28.600
WHITE MAJORITY FROM THE IDEA

25:28.666 --> 25:29.766
THAT THEY WANT GOVERNMENT TO

25:29.833 --> 25:32.033
HAVE A ROBUST ROLE IN SECURING

25:32.100 --> 25:33.133
ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY

25:33.200 --> 25:34.833
FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE THEY HAD TO

25:34.900 --> 25:37.400
SHARE IT ACROSS LINES OF RACE.

25:37.466 --> 25:39.100
I'M EXCITED ABOUT TAKING CARE OF

25:39.166 --> 25:41.900
PUBLIC NEEDS AGAIN FOR A DIVERSE

25:41.966 --> 25:45.033
PUBLIC.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.566
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

25:47.633 --> 25:52.400
>> WHAT I KEEP COMING BACK TO IS

25:52.466 --> 25:52.966
THIS LITTLE INCREDIBLY BORING

25:53.033 --> 25:53.600
STATISTIC THAT I'M A LITTLE

25:53.666 --> 25:55.400
OBSESSED WITH.

25:55.466 --> 26:00.933
IN PARIS, IT COSTS LESS THAN ONE

26:01.000 --> 26:03.166
SEVENTH TO BUILD A SUBWAY

26:03.233 --> 26:05.133
STATION AS IT DOES IN

26:05.200 --> 26:05.466
NEW YORK CITY.

26:05.533 --> 26:06.333
>> Bill: IN CALIFORNIA,

26:06.400 --> 26:10.233
PLEASE, WE KNOW THIS TOO.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.800
WE TRIED TO BUILD $200 MILLION A

26:12.866 --> 26:15.366
MILE AND IN FRANCE IT WAS LIKE

26:15.433 --> 26:16.566
13 MILLION, MAYBE I HAVE THOSE

26:16.633 --> 26:18.533
NUMBERS WRONG BUT IT WAS A

26:18.600 --> 26:19.733
RIDICULOUS DISCREPANCY.

26:19.800 --> 26:24.533
THIS WAS FRANCE, NOT A COUNTRY

26:24.600 --> 26:25.333
UNKNOWN TO STRIKES.

26:25.400 --> 26:26.900
>> RIGHT, I HOPE YOU'RE NOT

26:26.966 --> 26:28.433
GOING TO BLAME IT ON LABOR

26:28.500 --> 26:29.100
UNIONS.

26:29.166 --> 26:30.500
>> Bill: LABOR UNIONS

26:30.566 --> 26:31.233
CERTAINLY PLAY THEIR PART.

26:31.300 --> 26:32.700
>> THERE'S A LOT GOING ON AND

26:32.766 --> 26:34.566
WHEN YOU LOOK AT HEALTH

26:34.633 --> 26:36.100
EXPENDITURES, WE SPENT A

26:36.166 --> 26:36.700
STAGGERING AMOUNT ON PUBLIC

26:36.766 --> 26:38.733
HEALTH INSURANCE.

26:38.800 --> 26:39.933
WE SPEND AS MUCH ON PUBLIC

26:40.000 --> 26:41.566
HEALTH INSURANCE TO COVER A

26:41.633 --> 26:43.000
FIFTH OF THE POPULATION AS FOR

26:43.066 --> 26:43.766
EXAMPLE CANADA SPENDS ON THEIR

26:43.833 --> 26:46.333
ENTIRE POPULATION AND THAT'S

26:46.400 --> 26:47.300
BECAUSE THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING

26:47.366 --> 26:49.600
SPENT ON A RANGE OF DIFFERENT

26:49.666 --> 26:50.800
THINGS BUT WE AREN'T BEING

26:50.866 --> 26:51.766
STINGY WHEN IT COMES TO BEATING

26:51.833 --> 26:53.966
THESE NEEDS.

26:54.033 --> 26:55.400
THESE SYSTEMS ARE SO BROKEN AND

26:55.466 --> 26:56.866
RATHER THAN FIX THOSE SYSTEMS WE

26:56.933 --> 26:58.133
ARE TALKING ABOUT SHOVELING MORE

26:58.200 --> 27:00.566
MONEY INTO THEM, THAT'S NOT

27:00.633 --> 27:00.866
COMPASSION.

27:00.933 --> 27:04.066
THAT'S FECKLESSNESS.

27:04.133 --> 27:05.100
THIS BE WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO

27:05.166 --> 27:06.366
THINK WE COULD FIX THEM BEFORE

27:06.433 --> 27:09.766
WE SHOVEL THE MONEY.

27:09.833 --> 27:12.300
>> Bill: SINCE I'M IN SUCH A

27:12.366 --> 27:12.933
GOOD MOOD AND ALWAYS LOOKING ON

27:13.000 --> 27:19.133
THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M A BONG HALF

27:19.200 --> 27:20.566
FULL KIND OF GUY -- I'M GOING TO

27:20.633 --> 27:21.566
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF

27:21.633 --> 27:23.800
SOMETHING THAT IS HORRENDOUS BUT

27:23.866 --> 27:25.866
DEMOCRATS DO HAVE A HABIT OF

27:25.933 --> 27:26.766
DOWNPLAYING ACHIEVEMENTS.

27:26.833 --> 27:28.733
IT'S NOT THE BEST THING THEY DO,

27:28.800 --> 27:29.366
THEY ARE TERRIBLE AT BREAKING,

27:29.433 --> 27:33.566
THEY SAY WE WON ONE, IT'S VERY

27:33.633 --> 27:34.233
DANGEROUS THESE DAYS IN AMERICA

27:34.300 --> 27:36.700
TO CELEBRATE PROGRESS.

27:36.766 --> 27:37.433
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT

27:37.500 --> 27:39.300
BECAUSE THEN THEY SAY YOU DON'T

27:39.366 --> 27:40.266
CARE ENOUGH ABOUT FIXING THE

27:40.333 --> 27:42.500
THINGS THAT ARE STILL WRONG --

27:42.566 --> 27:44.066
YES, YOU CAN DO BOTH, YOU CAN

27:44.133 --> 27:47.400
HAVE TWO THOUGHTS IN YOUR HEAD.

27:47.466 --> 27:49.533
[LAUGHTER]

27:49.600 --> 27:51.733
THANK YOU.

27:51.800 --> 27:52.833
I'M WATCHING THIS DEREK CHAUVIN

27:52.900 --> 27:53.800
TRIAL AND MANY OF US WHO HAVE

27:53.866 --> 27:56.366
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE COPS FOR

27:56.433 --> 27:58.166
A VERY LONG TIME, I CERTAINLY

27:58.233 --> 27:59.166
HAVE COME EDITORIALS, PANEL

27:59.233 --> 28:00.500
DISCUSSIONS AND I'VE HAD MY LIST

28:00.566 --> 28:01.933
OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE COPS

28:02.000 --> 28:03.400
WHICH I'M SURE THEY HAVE TAKEN

28:03.466 --> 28:05.766
NOTE OF.

28:05.833 --> 28:07.100
[LAUGHTER]

28:07.166 --> 28:08.200
ONE OF THE RECURRING THEMES WAS

28:08.266 --> 28:09.466
AT SOME POINT THE BLUE WALL OF

28:09.533 --> 28:13.200
SILENCE HAS TO CRACK, I'VE BEEN

28:13.266 --> 28:16.166
SAYING THIS FOR DECADES AND I'M

28:16.233 --> 28:17.600
ONLY 35.

28:17.666 --> 28:17.866
[LAUGHTER]

28:17.933 --> 28:22.100
[APPLAUSE]

28:22.166 --> 28:23.566
NOW, THIS HAS FINALLY HAPPENED

28:23.633 --> 28:24.800
THE LAST FIVE YEARS CULMINATING

28:24.866 --> 28:30.000
I THINK IN THIS TRIAL.

28:30.066 --> 28:31.833
"JUST UNCALLED FOR" IS WHAT HIS

28:31.900 --> 28:33.400
SUPERVISOR STAYED ON THE SAND.

28:33.466 --> 28:35.133
IT IS NEVER USED TO HAPPEN, COPS

28:35.200 --> 28:36.766
NEVER DID THIS.

28:36.833 --> 28:38.200
THE POLICE CHIEF: "THAT IN NO

28:38.266 --> 28:40.700
WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM IS ANYTHING

28:40.766 --> 28:42.766
THAT IS BY OUR POLICY."

28:42.833 --> 28:44.366
COPS USE TO -- UNTIL FIVE YEARS

28:44.433 --> 28:45.700
AGO YOU COULD NEVER WIN A TRIAL

28:45.766 --> 28:47.133
AGAINST COPS THEY WOULD ALWAYS

28:47.200 --> 28:48.333
BE UP THERE SAYING YOU DON'T

28:48.400 --> 28:49.866
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE

28:49.933 --> 28:50.933
A COP -- I ALSO DON'T UNDERSTAND

28:51.000 --> 28:52.600
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE IN THE

28:52.666 --> 28:54.666
FROZEN YOGURT INDUSTRY, YOU'RE

28:54.733 --> 28:57.366
RIGHT, I DON'T.

28:57.433 --> 28:58.766
[LAUGHTER]

28:58.833 --> 29:00.266
COPS ARE A HARDER JOB, I GET IT

29:00.333 --> 29:01.733
BUT THAT WAS THEIR THING.

29:01.800 --> 29:02.933
LOOK AT THE TAPE AGAIN, YOU

29:03.000 --> 29:05.233
DON'T KNOW WHAT WE SEE -- AND

29:05.300 --> 29:06.533
NOW THIS HAS GONE AWAY.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.066
IT'S LIKE WE DO SEE, WE ARE NOT

29:08.133 --> 29:10.900
COPS, IT HAS NOT ROBBED US FROM

29:10.966 --> 29:13.700
BEING SENT INTO BEINGS.

29:13.766 --> 29:15.366
THEY ARE FINALLY TESTIFYING

29:15.433 --> 29:17.100
AGAINST THEIR OWN, CAN WE

29:17.166 --> 29:18.166
CELEBRATE A MOMENT THAT THIS IS

29:18.233 --> 29:21.566
A BIG FUCKING DEAL?

29:21.633 --> 29:23.333
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

29:23.400 --> 29:24.533
>> ABSOLUTELY WE CAN.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.433
IN FACT ONE OF THE FIRST RULES

29:26.500 --> 29:27.366
OF GOOD ORGANIZING IS TO

29:27.433 --> 29:28.533
CELEBRATE THE WINDS ALONG THE

29:28.600 --> 29:30.833
WAY BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED THAT

29:30.900 --> 29:32.566
SENSE OF HOPE.

29:32.633 --> 29:34.266
>> Bill: YES.

29:34.333 --> 29:36.733
>> LET'S BE CLEAR HERE, THE IDEA

29:36.800 --> 29:38.800
OF HOPE IS SO CENTRAL TO BLACK

29:38.866 --> 29:40.333
POLITICS IN AMERICA.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.400
YOU HAVE JESSE JACKSON, KEEP

29:42.466 --> 29:44.133
HOPE ALIVE, BARACK OBAMA, HOPE

29:44.200 --> 29:44.600
AND CHANGE.

29:44.666 --> 29:47.200
I CAN'T SIT HERE AS I DO AS THE

29:47.266 --> 29:48.033
DESCENDANTS OF ENSLAVED PEOPLE

29:48.100 --> 29:49.466
AND NOT HAVE HOPE.

29:49.533 --> 29:50.233
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS A

29:50.300 --> 29:52.533
STRANGER TO US.

29:52.600 --> 29:54.733
IN FACT I THINK THAT WHAT YOU

29:54.800 --> 29:55.933
ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW WITH THE

29:56.000 --> 29:58.666
BLUE WALL BEGINNING TO CRUMBLE

29:58.733 --> 30:03.066
IS THE RESULT OF MASSIVE

30:03.133 --> 30:06.366
ORGANIZING AND THE FACT THAT THE

30:06.433 --> 30:07.566
GREATEST, LARGEST SOCIAL

30:07.633 --> 30:08.566
MOVEMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY

30:08.633 --> 30:09.766
HAPPENED THE SUMMER BECAUSE OF

30:09.833 --> 30:12.166
THE VIDEO WE SAW, A PUBLIC

30:12.233 --> 30:14.166
EXECUTION OF A MAN AS THE WHOLE

30:14.233 --> 30:15.266
WORLD WATCHED THIS VIDEO TAKEN

30:15.333 --> 30:17.633
BY A 17-YEAR-OLD WHO SHOULD

30:17.700 --> 30:18.833
NEVER HAVE HAD TO BE IN THAT

30:18.900 --> 30:23.700
ROLE, RIGHT?

30:23.766 --> 30:26.100
YOU SAW IN 90% OF THE

30:26.166 --> 30:28.333
DEMONSTRATIONS THIS SUMMER WITH

30:28.400 --> 30:29.900
MAJORITY WHITE COUNTIES, THERE

30:29.966 --> 30:31.533
IS SO MUCH PROGRESS.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.033
NEW MEXICO JUST THIS PAST WEEK

30:33.100 --> 30:34.933
BECAME THE SECOND STATE TO END

30:35.000 --> 30:39.366
THIS THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE A

30:39.433 --> 30:40.166
THING ANYMORE, QUALIFIED

30:40.233 --> 30:41.766
IMMUNITY FOR STATE ACTORS, THE

30:41.833 --> 30:43.600
IDEA I CAN'T SUE YOU IF YOU

30:43.666 --> 30:44.233
KNOWINGLY BREAK THE LAW BECAUSE

30:44.300 --> 30:46.866
YOU'RE A GOVERNMENT AGENT, THAT

30:46.933 --> 30:47.966
SHOULD DEFINITELY NO LONGER BE

30:48.033 --> 30:48.633
THE CASE IN THE MAJORITY OF

30:48.700 --> 30:53.533
PEOPLE AGREE.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.733
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

30:54.800 --> 30:56.133
THERE'S A LOT OF POSITIVES.

30:56.200 --> 30:57.166
>> I GREW UP IN BROOKLYN,

30:57.233 --> 31:01.733
NEW YORK, I STILL LIVE THERE NOW

31:01.800 --> 31:03.700
AT A TIME -- THANK YOU, SIR, --

31:03.766 --> 31:03.966
[LAUGHTER]

31:04.033 --> 31:06.833
IT WAS A PRETTY VIOLENT AND

31:06.900 --> 31:08.100
FRIGHTENING PLACE TO BECOME I

31:08.166 --> 31:09.100
WAS A VICTIM OF CRIME ON A

31:09.166 --> 31:10.466
NUMBER OF OCCASIONS, SO WAS MY

31:10.533 --> 31:13.800
FATHER, SO WAS MY MOTHER, WE

31:13.866 --> 31:15.033
LIVED IN A NOT NECESSARILY THE

31:15.100 --> 31:18.533
BEST OR FANCIEST NEIGHBORHOOD,

31:18.600 --> 31:20.133
MY FOLKS DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE

31:20.200 --> 31:21.266
THE CITY, THEY NEVER DID, THEY

31:21.333 --> 31:23.966
ARE STILL THERE.

31:24.033 --> 31:26.133
IT WAS A DANGEROUS, SCARY TIME

31:26.200 --> 31:27.766
AND YOU BASICALLY TREATED IT AS

31:27.833 --> 31:28.700
THE WEATHER.

31:28.766 --> 31:29.733
IT'S A RAINSTORM, YOU GET

31:29.800 --> 31:33.866
MUGGED, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

31:33.933 --> 31:35.133
THEN FOR 25 YEARS OR SO YOU HAD

31:35.200 --> 31:37.266
A STEEP DECREASE IN CRIME, IT

31:37.333 --> 31:38.666
WAS REALLY HARD-FOUGHT AND HARD

31:38.733 --> 31:40.366
WON COME IT HAPPEN FOR A LOT OF

31:40.433 --> 31:41.766
REASONS, THE POLICE WERE A BIG

31:41.833 --> 31:43.333
PART OF IT, SO WAS THE

31:43.400 --> 31:44.766
REVITALIZATION OF A LOT OF

31:44.833 --> 31:45.500
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAD BEEN

31:45.566 --> 31:47.366
FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED.

31:47.433 --> 31:48.500
WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN MORE RECENTLY

31:48.566 --> 31:51.100
IS A CHANGE.

31:51.166 --> 31:53.033
WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN HIS CRIME

31:53.100 --> 31:53.500
COME BACK IN A LOT OF

31:53.566 --> 31:54.933
COMMUNITIES, YOU HAVE SEEN A

31:55.000 --> 31:55.800
SURGE IN THE NUMBER OF

31:55.866 --> 31:57.100
SHOOTINGS, YOU'VE SEEN A SURGE

31:57.166 --> 31:58.966
IN A NUMBER OF MURDERS, YOU

31:59.033 --> 32:00.000
WOULD SEE MORE MURDERS IF ONLY

32:00.066 --> 32:02.100
WE HADN'T GOTTEN A LOT BETTER AT

32:02.166 --> 32:05.933
TREATING GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.700
PART OF THE STORY I THINK IS THE

32:07.766 --> 32:09.866
FACT THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE

32:09.933 --> 32:11.733
20 TENS, THE PER CAPITA RATE OF

32:11.800 --> 32:13.666
POLICE IN THIS COUNTRY WENT DOWN

32:13.733 --> 32:15.766
BY ABOUT 8-9%, IN NEW YORK CITY

32:15.833 --> 32:19.100
IN 2020 IT WENT DOWN BY ANOTHER

32:19.166 --> 32:19.800
7%.

32:19.866 --> 32:22.133
THERE IS A GENERATION OF POLICE

32:22.200 --> 32:23.566
WHO JOINED DEPARTMENTS IN THE

32:23.633 --> 32:26.433
MID-90s AND ON, THOSE GUYS ARE

32:26.500 --> 32:26.700
RETIRING.

32:26.766 --> 32:28.733
A LOT OF THEM ARE RETIRING --

32:28.800 --> 32:30.800
GUYS AND GALS, A LOT OF THEM ARE

32:30.866 --> 32:33.066
RETIRING SOONER THAN THEY

32:33.133 --> 32:33.500
WOULD'VE OTHERWISE.

32:33.566 --> 32:34.133
>> Bill: PORTLAND HAS AN

32:34.200 --> 32:35.100
EXODUS.

32:35.166 --> 32:35.900
IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

32:35.966 --> 32:37.100
WHO WANTS ANTIFA TO GET RESULTS,

32:37.166 --> 32:40.933
YOU WIN.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.333
THEY MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU WANT

32:43.400 --> 32:44.100
BUT 115 POLICE OFFICERS HAVE

32:44.166 --> 32:47.133
LEFT PORTLAND, THAT'S A LOT IN A

32:47.200 --> 32:47.733
CITY THAT SIZE.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.533
>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PROGRESS

32:49.600 --> 32:51.666
IN THE QUESTION IS HOW YOU BUILD

32:51.733 --> 32:52.800
ON THE PROGRESS?

32:52.866 --> 32:54.266
THE WAY TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS

32:54.333 --> 32:55.266
I WOULD ARGUE IS TO SAY WE

32:55.333 --> 32:56.933
DEMAND MORE FROM POLICE, WE

32:57.000 --> 32:57.966
EXPECT MORE FROM THEM, WE EXPECT

32:58.033 --> 33:00.566
THEM TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH

33:00.633 --> 33:01.966
RESPECT, THAT IS VALUABLE AND

33:02.033 --> 33:03.733
IMPORTANT AND THAT MEANS MAKING

33:03.800 --> 33:05.233
THIS A VALUED PROFESSION, THAT

33:05.300 --> 33:06.333
MIGHT ACTUALLY MEAN SEEING TO IT

33:06.400 --> 33:08.366
THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO PAY PEOPLE

33:08.433 --> 33:09.366
MORE, WE MIGHT HAVE TO TREAT

33:09.433 --> 33:10.400
THEM A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY TO

33:10.466 --> 33:13.033
ENSURE WE HAVE THOSE PEOPLE WHO

33:13.100 --> 33:14.166
ARE PUBLIC SPIRITED AND WILLING

33:14.233 --> 33:17.100
TO PUT THEMSELVES IN DANGER.

33:17.166 --> 33:17.366
[APPLAUSE]

33:17.433 --> 33:20.900
LET'S BUILD ON THIS.

33:20.966 --> 33:22.466
>> Bill: MOST OF THEM ARE PAID

33:22.533 --> 33:23.700
PRETTY WELL, I DON'T THINK THAT

33:23.766 --> 33:28.100
IS THE ISSUE.

33:28.166 --> 33:30.733
AGAIN, I'VE HAD MY LIST OF

33:30.800 --> 33:32.433
COMPLAINTS, ONE OF THEM WITH THE

33:32.500 --> 33:33.100
POLICE IS SOMEWHERE THEY GOT IT

33:33.166 --> 33:34.366
IN THEIR HEAD THAT THEY COULD

33:34.433 --> 33:34.966
NEVER HAVE A MOMENT WHERE THEY

33:35.033 --> 33:36.733
WERE AT RISK.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.700
IF THEY FELT AT RISK AT ALL,

33:38.766 --> 33:41.100
JUST EMPTY THE CLIP INTO

33:41.166 --> 33:42.933
WHATEVER IS WORRYING YOU.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.233
NOW, IT'S A DANGEROUS JOB,

33:44.300 --> 33:44.866
ALTHOUGH BY STATISTICS NOT EVEN

33:44.933 --> 33:47.533
IN THE TOP TEN.

33:47.600 --> 33:48.233
THAT'S NOT A SLIGHT AGAINST

33:48.300 --> 33:52.666
COPS, THAT'S THE FACT.

33:52.733 --> 33:54.533
DAREDEVILS LIKE CABDRIVERS AND

33:54.600 --> 33:55.633
LINEMEN AND FISHERMEN, IT'S A

33:55.700 --> 33:59.500
MORE DANGEROUS JOB, WE SHOULD

33:59.566 --> 34:01.800
COMPENSATE THEM.

34:01.866 --> 34:05.966
>> YOU HAVE TO HAVE LIMITS.

34:06.033 --> 34:06.500
>> Bill: WRITES, YOU CAN'T

34:06.566 --> 34:11.533
FEEL -- PORTLAND, ONE RETIRING

34:11.600 --> 34:12.400
DETECTIVES AT THE COMMUNITY

34:12.466 --> 34:13.500
SHOWS ZERO SUPPORT, THE MAYOR

34:13.566 --> 34:17.500
AND THE COUNCIL IGNORE ACTUAL

34:17.566 --> 34:19.133
FACTS -- I'M SAYING PORTLAND IS

34:19.200 --> 34:19.933
A CAUTIONARY TALE BECAUSE WE

34:20.000 --> 34:21.866
DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD

34:21.933 --> 34:22.600
WITHOUT POLICE, THEN IT'S THE

34:22.666 --> 34:25.066
PURGE EVERY NIGHT.

34:25.133 --> 34:25.400
[APPLAUSE]

34:25.466 --> 34:28.433
IF YOU THINK THAT'S A GREAT

34:28.500 --> 34:28.666
IDEA --

34:28.733 --> 34:30.300
>> I THINK WE WANT TO LIVE IN A

34:30.366 --> 34:31.700
WORLD WHERE MOST OF THE THINGS

34:31.766 --> 34:34.100
THAT LEAD TO POLICE INTERACTION

34:34.166 --> 34:37.533
ARE STOPPED WAY BEFORE HAND.

34:37.600 --> 34:41.400
>> Bill: YES, AND THE DRUG

34:41.466 --> 34:41.566
WAR.

34:41.633 --> 34:46.733
>> YES.

34:46.800 --> 34:51.233

34:52.533 --> 34:54.000
OF THOSE TABLOIDS STOLE FROM US

34:54.066 --> 34:56.900
AND DID AS THEIR OWN, I HATE

34:56.966 --> 34:58.333
THAT PEOPLE RIP US OFF LIKE THAT

34:58.400 --> 35:00.100
BUT WE THOUGHT IT'S A GOOD THING

35:00.166 --> 35:01.266
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT

35:01.333 --> 35:01.800

BLAME THIS VERY SOON ON CANCEL

36:33.933 --> 36:36.066
CULTURE AND THIS IS NOT A GOOD

36:36.133 --> 36:36.700
DEVELOPMENT THE FACT THAT THE

36:36.766 --> 36:38.633
CRITIQUE OF CANCEL CULTURE IS

36:38.700 --> 36:41.966
GETTING A BAD NAME.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.066
CANCEL CULTURE DOES NEED TO BE

36:44.133 --> 36:44.333
CRITIQUED.

36:44.400 --> 36:50.400
[APPLAUSE]

36:50.466 --> 36:51.666

36:53.233 --> 36:54.400
HE'S A BASKETBALL PLAYER AND I

36:54.466 --> 36:55.800
WATCH BASKETBALL, SO HE MUST BE

36:55.866 --> 37:02.133
A SCRUB.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.833
[LAUGHTER]

37:03.900 --> 37:05.100
HE GOT CANCELED, BOY DID HE GET

37:05.166 --> 37:07.800
CANCELED THIS WEEK.

37:07.866 --> 37:11.733
IF HE WAS STREAMING HIMSELF

37:11.800 --> 37:12.933
PLAYING CALL OF DUTY ON TWITCH,

37:13.000 --> 37:15.100
THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT

37:15.166 --> 37:15.566
SENTENCE I UNDERSTAND.

37:15.633 --> 37:18.600
OR WANT TO.

37:18.666 --> 37:22.100
DO I NOT GET TWITCH, CALL OF

37:22.166 --> 37:23.133
DUTY, AND STREAMING, I DON'T AND

37:23.200 --> 37:25.133
I'M SO GOOD WITH THAT.

37:25.200 --> 37:31.300
ANYWAY, HE USED A JEWISH SLUR,

37:31.366 --> 37:33.400
IT BEGINS WITH K, I WON'T SAY IT

37:33.466 --> 37:35.066
BECAUSE BABIES OUT THERE CAN'T

37:35.133 --> 37:36.266
TAKE IT WHEN YOU SAY A BAD WORD

37:36.333 --> 37:38.100
AND WE WANT TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON

37:38.166 --> 37:38.466
THE ISSUE.

37:38.533 --> 37:40.966
I'M SURE YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORD

37:41.033 --> 37:41.466
IS, IS NOT THAT MANY BAD

37:41.533 --> 37:44.500
NAMES -- HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW

37:44.566 --> 37:45.666
WHAT IT MEANT, I COMPLETELY

37:45.733 --> 37:49.733
BELIEVE HIM BECAUSE HE'S PLAYING

37:49.800 --> 37:50.000
TWITCH.

37:50.066 --> 37:54.100
ON TWITCH, WHATEVER THE FUCK

38:08.933 --> 38:09.866
SURVIVORS, DO WE HAVE TO DRAG

THE HOLOCAUST INTO THIS?

38:14.066 --> 38:14.566
REALLY?

38:14.633 --> 38:17.066
PASSOVER, HE HAS TO GO ON ZOOM

38:17.133 --> 38:18.266
IN FRONT OF COLLEGE KIDS SO THEY

38:18.333 --> 38:20.533
CAN YELL AT HIM, DOES EVERYTHING

38:20.600 --> 38:22.466
HAVE TO BE A SUMMARY EXECUTION

38:22.533 --> 38:22.800
IN AMERICA?

38:22.866 --> 38:26.300
WHAT HAPPENED IT JUST ACCEPTING

38:26.366 --> 38:27.133
THE APOLOGY?

38:27.200 --> 38:29.633
OKAY, YOU MADE A MISTAKE AS

38:29.700 --> 38:31.633
HUMANS DO, CAN WE GET ON WITH

38:31.700 --> 38:34.333
OUR LIVES?

38:34.400 --> 38:35.766
I WAS RAISED CATHOLIC BUT MY

38:35.833 --> 38:36.966
MOTHER IS -- NOT REALLY, SHE'S

38:37.033 --> 38:43.033
SORT OF A JEW, SHE WAS NEVER IN

38:43.100 --> 38:44.566
A TEMPLE, DOES THAT GIVE ME

38:44.633 --> 38:46.366
ENOUGH CREDIT FOR SAY IT FOR THE

39:01.800 --> 39:03.600

39:03.666 --> 39:05.333
IS, THIS IS NEWS TO ME ON THAT

39:05.400 --> 39:06.133
STORY, I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE

39:06.200 --> 39:08.600
SAYING, THE WORLD IN WHICH REAL

39:08.666 --> 39:10.800
PEOPLE LIVE IS ALSO THE WORLD IN

39:10.866 --> 39:12.900
WHICH THERE ARE MASSIVE

39:12.966 --> 39:16.466
CONSEQUENCES FOR WORKING-CLASS

39:16.533 --> 39:17.433
PEOPLE, LOW INCOME PEOPLE COME

39:17.500 --> 39:18.066
I'M THINKING ABOUT A TEACHER AT

39:18.133 --> 39:20.500
MY KIDS AT SCHOOL WHO IS SAYING

39:20.566 --> 39:21.400
THE SCHOOL HE TAUGHT AT BEFORE

39:21.466 --> 39:22.966
IF THE KID CAME IN WITH THE

39:23.033 --> 39:24.000
WRONG COLOR SOCKS THEY WOULD BE

39:24.066 --> 39:26.833
SENT HOME.

39:26.900 --> 39:29.400
NO EXCUSES, BROKEN WINDOWS

39:29.466 --> 39:31.500
THEORY IN CHARTER SCHOOL

39:31.566 --> 39:34.566
CLASSROOMS AND THERE IS THIS

39:34.633 --> 39:38.500
WORLD -- IT'S A UNIFORM, A DRESS

39:38.566 --> 39:40.566
CODE, THERE ARE NOT TWO PAIR OF

39:40.633 --> 39:41.866
SOCKS IN MY HOUSE THAT MATCH.

39:41.933 --> 39:43.300
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT BE ABLE TO

39:43.366 --> 39:44.733
DO THAT FOR MY FAMILY.

39:44.800 --> 39:45.400
>> Bill: HOW IS THIS

39:45.466 --> 39:49.733
COMFORTING TO MYERS LEONARD?

39:49.800 --> 39:51.333
>> I THINK MORE ABOUT NOT THE

39:51.400 --> 39:53.166
MILLIONAIRE NBA PLAYER AND WHAT

39:53.233 --> 39:54.100
HE DOES SPEW AND I DON'T KNOW IF

39:54.166 --> 39:55.633
HE'S A MILLIONAIRE.

39:55.700 --> 39:59.666
>> I ASSUME HE IS.

39:59.733 --> 40:00.400
HE'S A POWERFUL PERSON.

40:00.466 --> 40:01.466
>> Bill: IT'S SUCH BULLSHIT,

40:01.533 --> 40:02.833
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IT IF IT WAS

40:02.900 --> 40:05.966
THE START OF THE TEAM?

40:06.033 --> 40:07.133
WITH THEY HAVE DONE THIS?

40:07.200 --> 40:11.300
>> PROBABLY MORE.

40:11.366 --> 40:13.033
>> Bill: I'M NOT GOING TO EVEN

40:13.100 --> 40:14.266
NAME A PERSON BECAUSE I DON'T

40:14.333 --> 40:14.866
WANT TO ASSOCIATE THEM WITH

40:14.933 --> 40:19.933
USING A RACIAL SLUR, BUT THERE

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
COULD BE A BIG NAME NBA PLAYER,

40:23.066 --> 40:24.033
SOMEBODY OR ANYBODY WHO JUST

40:24.100 --> 40:26.200
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS TERM OR

40:26.266 --> 40:28.866
USED IT IN A FIT OF ANGER AND

40:28.933 --> 40:30.500
REGRETTED IT, WHAT THEY HAVE

40:30.566 --> 40:30.866
SUSPENDED HIM?

40:30.933 --> 40:34.666
I DON'T THINK SO.

40:34.733 --> 40:36.033
>> I ACTUALLY THINK THIS CUTS IN

40:36.100 --> 40:39.100
A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

40:39.166 --> 40:40.533
MY VIEW IS THE CONVERSATION

40:40.600 --> 40:41.733
ABOUT CANCEL CULTURE SOME PEOPLE

40:41.800 --> 40:43.366
FIND IT FRUSTRATING SOME PEOPLE

40:43.433 --> 40:44.333
FIND IT ANNOYING OR MISPLACED

40:44.400 --> 40:45.966
BUT THE REASON IT'S IMPORTANT TO

40:46.033 --> 40:47.933
TALK ABOUT AND CRITIQUE IT IS

40:48.000 --> 40:50.700
THERE ACTUALLY ARE A TON OF

40:50.766 --> 40:51.900
PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE

40:51.966 --> 40:54.033
RESOURCES, WHO DO NOT HAVE

40:54.100 --> 40:56.100
LAWYERS, WHO ARE PRETTY MUCH

40:56.166 --> 40:57.733
DEFENSELESS AND PART OF WHAT

40:57.800 --> 40:58.900
YOU'RE SEEING IS PEOPLE WHO ARE

40:58.966 --> 41:00.066
ACTUALLY VISIBLE AND POWERFUL

41:00.133 --> 41:01.633
WHERE IT'S HAPPENING TO THEM BUT

41:01.700 --> 41:04.433
I PROMISE YOU IT'S HAPPENING

41:04.500 --> 41:05.266
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THAT KIND

41:05.333 --> 41:08.033
OF WEIGHT.

41:08.100 --> 41:08.533
>> Bill: THIS AMERICAN

41:08.600 --> 41:10.366
BLOOD LUST FOR GROVELING.

41:10.433 --> 41:12.533
IT'S GROSS.

41:12.600 --> 41:16.266
I DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF THAT

41:16.333 --> 41:18.133
TEAM.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.033
ALSO, YOU'RE RIGHT, ITS ACTUAL

41:20.100 --> 41:20.900
JOBS AND LIVES PEOPLE ARE LOSING

41:20.966 --> 41:22.933
BUT I DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A

41:23.000 --> 41:24.033
COUNTRY WHERE WE HAVE THE RED

41:24.100 --> 41:24.733
GUARD.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.033
YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING

41:26.100 --> 41:27.333
ABOUT DURING THE CULTURAL

41:27.400 --> 41:28.333
REVOLUTION, WE HAVE A RED GUARD

41:28.400 --> 41:31.000
IN THIS COUNTRY NOW.

41:31.066 --> 41:33.400
>> THE ARGUMENT THAT I FIND

41:33.466 --> 41:34.666
INTERESTING AND CHALLENGING THAT

41:34.733 --> 41:36.466
I STRUGGLE WITH IS THE IDEA THAT

41:36.533 --> 41:37.366
PART OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR

41:37.433 --> 41:39.300
SOCIETY IS PEOPLE WHO DID NOT

41:39.366 --> 41:40.833
HAVE VOICE AND POWER BEFORE HAVE

41:40.900 --> 41:42.566
IT NOW AND WHEN PEOPLE HAVE

41:42.633 --> 41:45.500
VOICE AND POWER IF YOU OFFEND

41:45.566 --> 41:46.033
THEM, IF YOU OFFEND THEIR

41:46.100 --> 41:46.866
SENSIBILITIES YOU'RE GOING TO

41:46.933 --> 41:51.200
HEAR ABOUT IT AND THAT IS PART

41:51.266 --> 41:52.433
OF THE HEALTHY GIVE-AND-TAKE OF

41:52.500 --> 41:52.733
THE CULTURE.

41:52.800 --> 41:53.700
WE ARE HEARING THE MORE PEOPLE

41:53.766 --> 41:55.400
NOW, I GET IT BUT I ALSO THINK

41:55.466 --> 41:56.266
HE DID HAVE THE SENSE OF

41:56.333 --> 41:58.333
FORGIVENESS THAT YOU'RE

41:58.400 --> 41:59.700
DESCRIBING, THE IDEA THAT YOU

41:59.766 --> 42:01.366
CAN BE IGNORANCE, YOU'RE NOT

42:01.433 --> 42:03.066
NECESSARILY WORTHY OF A DEATH

42:03.133 --> 42:04.700
SENTENCE IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE.

42:04.766 --> 42:05.533
PEOPLE USED TO SAY THAT, THEY

42:05.600 --> 42:08.466
USED TO SAY THAT WAS AN IGNORANT

42:08.533 --> 42:09.600
COMMENT RATHER THAN YOU ARE A

42:09.666 --> 42:10.666
DEEPLY IMMORAL PERSON WHO NEEDS

42:10.733 --> 42:11.900
TO BE PUNISHED FOR THE REST OF

42:11.966 --> 42:12.200
YOUR LIFE.

42:12.266 --> 42:14.500
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.

42:14.566 --> 42:16.100
>> Bill: ALSO ONE OF THE BAD

42:16.166 --> 42:18.366
THINGS ABOUT THIS IS PEOPLE WHO

42:18.433 --> 42:19.500
DON'T FOLLOW POLITICS AS MUCH AS

42:19.566 --> 42:20.800
THE FOLKS WHO WATCH THIS SHOW

42:20.866 --> 42:21.866
ARE GOING TO LUMP THIS ISSUE IN

42:21.933 --> 42:24.933
WITH OTHER ISSUES.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.266
EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON

42:26.333 --> 42:28.366
IN GEORGIA, THE ALL-STAR GAME

42:28.433 --> 42:29.900
WAS PULLED OUT OF GEORGIA

42:29.966 --> 42:30.500
BECAUSE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL

42:30.566 --> 42:31.600
AND A NUMBER OF CORPORATIONS ARE

42:31.666 --> 42:35.333
PROTESTING THE VOTING RIGHTS

42:35.400 --> 42:36.566
LAWS -- ANTI-VOTING LAWS THAT

42:36.633 --> 42:40.233
GEORGIA HAS PASSED.

42:40.300 --> 42:41.666
I SOUGHT DESCRIBED SOMEWHERE AS

42:41.733 --> 42:44.833
A SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUE.

42:44.900 --> 42:47.000
OKAY, BOATING, THIS IS NOT SOME

42:47.066 --> 42:49.000
SILLY WOKE ISSUE, THIS IS

42:49.066 --> 42:51.500
FUNDAMENTAL STUFF.

42:51.566 --> 42:54.400
THIS IS FUNDAMENTAL STUFF.

42:54.466 --> 42:54.733
[APPLAUSE]

42:54.800 --> 42:56.466
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY REALLY ONLY

42:56.533 --> 42:59.166
HAS ONE STRATEGY NOW, WHICH IS

42:59.233 --> 43:02.033
STOP VOTING, STOP PEOPLE FROM

43:02.100 --> 43:04.133
VOTING AND EVEN DON'T RESPECT

43:04.200 --> 43:04.900
ELECTIONS.

43:04.966 --> 43:05.866
THAT IS THEIR STRATEGY NOW,

43:05.933 --> 43:07.566
DON'T BE TO THE OTHER TEAM, BEAT

43:07.633 --> 43:11.633
THE REFS.

43:11.700 --> 43:12.400
AS YOU KNOW, MAJOR LEAGUE

43:12.466 --> 43:15.700
BASEBALL IS OUT, ALSO COCA-COLA

43:15.766 --> 43:18.066
WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST

43:18.133 --> 43:19.333
IDENTIFIED BRANDS CERTAINLY IN

43:19.400 --> 43:20.600
ATLANTA IF NOT THE WHOLE WORLD

43:20.666 --> 43:24.066
BUT IT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

43:24.133 --> 43:26.433
CITY.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.033
NOW THE GOVERNOR OF TEXAS WHO

43:27.100 --> 43:28.033
WAS GOING TO THROW OUT THE FIRST

43:28.100 --> 43:31.133
BALL AT HIS GAME -- NOT GOING TO

43:31.200 --> 43:33.866
DO THAT BECAUSE WE ARE TAKING

43:33.933 --> 43:34.600
SIDES NOW.

43:34.666 --> 43:35.200
IT'S SO INTERESTING.

43:35.266 --> 43:37.700
WE ARE GOING TO GET DOWN TO A

43:37.766 --> 43:42.466
PLACE WHERE THE DEMOCRATS DRINK

43:42.533 --> 43:43.433
COKE AND REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE

43:43.500 --> 43:45.433
TO DRINK -- DO YOU THINK THAT'S

43:45.500 --> 43:46.300
WHERE WE ARE HEADING?

43:46.366 --> 43:48.166
WE SEEM TO BE POLITICIZING EVEN

43:48.233 --> 43:51.233
THE PRODUCTS WE USE.

43:51.300 --> 43:52.966
WE ARE TAKING THIS TO THE CEREAL

43:53.033 --> 43:53.166
AISLE.

43:53.233 --> 43:56.100
IN AMERICA.

43:56.166 --> 43:59.033
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO COME

43:59.100 --> 43:59.300
TOGETHER.

43:59.366 --> 44:01.666
[APPLAUSE]

44:01.733 --> 44:04.266
>> THIS ISSUE IS DEADLY SERIOUS

44:04.333 --> 44:06.133
AS YOU'RE SAYING, LET'S BE VERY

44:06.200 --> 44:06.366
CLEAR.

44:06.433 --> 44:08.533
THE GEORGIA ELECTION LAW IS

44:08.600 --> 44:10.366
BASED ON A LIE AND IT'S A LIE

44:10.433 --> 44:11.833
THAT COMPELLED A THOUSAND PEOPLE

44:11.900 --> 44:14.200
TO TRY TO RUSH THE CAPITAL AND

44:14.266 --> 44:16.833
DO WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE DONE AND

44:16.900 --> 44:19.233
IT LED TO SIX PEOPLE BEING

44:19.300 --> 44:20.100
KILLED.

44:20.166 --> 44:21.800
IT'S STILL A LIE THAT ANIMATES

44:21.866 --> 44:23.533
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT'S A LIE

44:23.600 --> 44:25.233
THAT MAKES THE MAJORITY OF

44:25.300 --> 44:26.433
REPUBLICANS THINK THAT

44:26.500 --> 44:27.966
DONALD TRUMP WON THE ELECTION.

44:28.033 --> 44:28.500
THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY

44:28.566 --> 44:32.366
DANGEROUS STUFF.

44:32.433 --> 44:34.200
AND YET IT IS TRUE, WE ARE

44:34.266 --> 44:35.466
SEEING CORPORATIONS HAVE TO HOLD

44:35.533 --> 44:37.266
THE LINE ON BASIC AMERICAN

44:37.333 --> 44:38.166
VALUES BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE

44:38.233 --> 44:40.466
REPUBLICAN PARTY WON'T.

44:40.533 --> 44:42.066
THAT IS THE WAKE-UP CALL FOR

44:42.133 --> 44:44.100
CORPORATE AMERICA SINCE

44:44.166 --> 44:45.500
DONALD TRUMP IS THERE ARE SOME

44:45.566 --> 44:47.033
THINGS WE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE A

44:47.100 --> 44:48.333
PART OF BECAUSE POLITICS, TWO

44:48.400 --> 44:50.266
PARTIES WOULD'VE PROTECTED AT

44:50.333 --> 44:51.700
LEAST THAT.

44:51.766 --> 44:54.233
THIS IS NO LONGER ONE OF THEM.

44:54.300 --> 44:56.400
WE HAVE STUDY AFTER STUDY

44:56.466 --> 44:57.833
SHOWING THAT IN PLACES WHERE

44:57.900 --> 44:58.566
REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL, THE

44:58.633 --> 45:01.000
DEMOCRACY SUFFERS.

45:01.066 --> 45:03.666
THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT POWER,

45:03.733 --> 45:05.633
IT'S ABOUT FUNDAMENTALLY A FEAR

45:05.700 --> 45:07.300
OF SHARING DEMOCRACY WITH THE

45:07.366 --> 45:08.500
AMERICA WE ARE BECOMING.

45:08.566 --> 45:12.100
>> Bill: OR LOSING ELECTIONS.

45:12.166 --> 45:12.933
THEY KNOW THEY ARE ON THE WRONG

45:13.000 --> 45:17.133
SIDE OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS.

45:17.200 --> 45:19.533
THAT WAS TRUMP'S GENIUS BACK IN

45:19.600 --> 45:20.400
2016, EVERYONE IS SAYING THAT

45:20.466 --> 45:21.700
THE BY THE REPUBLICANS BUT I

45:21.766 --> 45:23.666
LOOK AROUND AND MAYBE WE HAVE A

45:23.733 --> 45:25.066
COUPLE MORE ELECTIONS IN US.

45:25.133 --> 45:27.366
I STILL SEE A LOT OF WHITE

45:27.433 --> 45:27.600
PEOPLE.

45:27.666 --> 45:30.666
THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE.

45:30.733 --> 45:32.300
THE REASON WHY I THINK COCA-COLA

45:32.366 --> 45:33.033
WHICH IS A COMPANY THAT CARES A

45:33.100 --> 45:35.733
LOT ABOUT MONEY -- MAYBE THE

45:35.800 --> 45:37.133
PEOPLE WHO HAD A BIG CORPORATION

45:37.200 --> 45:38.900
LIKE THAT ARE JUST WONDERFUL

45:38.966 --> 45:40.766
PEOPLE, BUT I THINK BASICALLY

45:40.833 --> 45:42.066
THEY LOOK AROUND AND THEY

45:42.133 --> 45:42.633
PROBABLY TALK TO THE YOUNGER

45:42.700 --> 45:46.033
PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE.

45:46.100 --> 45:47.233
>> EMPLOYEES ARE REALLY

45:47.300 --> 45:47.533
ORGANIZING.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.000
>> Bill: AND THEY GO WHO DO WE

45:49.066 --> 45:51.133
WANT ON OUR SIDE TO BE DRINKING

45:51.200 --> 45:51.400
COCA-COLA?

45:51.466 --> 45:53.100
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE FUTURE OF

45:53.166 --> 45:53.966
THE COUNTRY OR THE CRANKY WHITE

45:54.033 --> 45:58.433
PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING OFF?

45:58.500 --> 45:59.300
[APPLAUSE]

45:59.366 --> 46:00.633
I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING

46:00.700 --> 46:01.900
THE SPIRIT >> THIS A LEGITIMATE

46:01.966 --> 46:03.733
DEBATE TO BE HAD ABOUT THE

46:03.800 --> 46:05.033
PARTICULARS OF THE GEORGIA

46:05.100 --> 46:05.600
LEGISLATION BUT I ALSO THINK

46:05.666 --> 46:08.266
THERE IS THIS INCREDIBLY

46:08.333 --> 46:09.033
APOCALYPTIC RHETORIC THAT

46:09.100 --> 46:11.066
IGNORES THE FACT THAT IN MANY

46:11.133 --> 46:12.033
RESPECTS THIS LAW IS EXPANDING

46:12.100 --> 46:14.866
VOTING ACCESS.

46:14.933 --> 46:15.966
AGAIN, THERE'S A LEGITIMATE

46:16.033 --> 46:16.600
DEBATE TO BE HAD AND GEORGIA IS

46:16.666 --> 46:18.500
A COMPETITIVE STATE.

46:18.566 --> 46:22.300
>> Bill: THE GEORGIA LAW?

46:22.366 --> 46:24.266
ITS EXPANDING ACCESS WHERE THEY

46:24.333 --> 46:26.666
WANT IT EXPANDED IN THE RURAL

46:26.733 --> 46:27.900
AREAS.

46:27.966 --> 46:29.600
>> IT'S MUCH BROADER ACCESS THAT

46:29.666 --> 46:30.400
A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES

46:30.466 --> 46:32.566
INCLUDING MY HOME STATE OF

46:32.633 --> 46:33.300
NEW YORK.

46:33.366 --> 46:36.266
>> THAT HAS BEEN A RIGHT WING

46:36.333 --> 46:37.333
TALKING POINT BUT GEORGIA IS

46:37.400 --> 46:39.333
49TH IN TERMS OF EASE OF A

46:39.400 --> 46:43.633
VOTING, YORK IS 17.

46:43.700 --> 46:45.966
>> IT'S ABSENTEE BALLOTS, IT'S

46:46.033 --> 46:46.566
EXPANDING EARLY VOTING BEYOND

46:46.633 --> 46:48.166
MANY OTHER STATES.

46:48.233 --> 46:52.733
>> ALL OF THOSE THINGS -- MISSES

46:52.800 --> 46:54.133
DEEPLY BORING AND I'M AN

46:54.200 --> 46:54.700
ELECTION LAW PERSONS ARE NOT

46:54.766 --> 46:55.666
GOING TO GET WAY INTO IT BUT

46:55.733 --> 46:59.500
THIS IS THE ISSUE, GEORGIA'S

46:59.566 --> 47:01.100
MOVE IS BASED ON A LIE, IT'S

47:01.166 --> 47:03.500
BASED ON A RESPONSE TO HISTORIC

47:03.566 --> 47:04.100
TURNOUT AND BLACK POLITICAL

47:04.166 --> 47:06.233
POWER, CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF

47:06.300 --> 47:07.666
THE STATE.

47:07.733 --> 47:14.000
NEW YORK, GOD BLESSED F FOR BOTH

47:14.066 --> 47:14.633
OF US LIVE HAS NEVER HAD GREAT

47:14.700 --> 47:16.333
ELECTION LAWS AND WE HAVE TWO ON

47:16.400 --> 47:16.800
THE BALLOT THIS FALL.

47:16.866 --> 47:20.733
OVERALL YOU CAN'T COMPARE WHAT'S

47:20.800 --> 47:21.933
HAPPENING IN THE STATES, JIM

47:22.000 --> 47:24.033
CROW STATE WITH POLL TAXES AND

47:24.100 --> 47:26.200
VIOLENT REPRESSION UNTIL 56

47:26.266 --> 47:29.900
YEARS AGO, WE HAD A MULTIRACIAL

47:29.966 --> 47:30.933
DEMOCRACY IN THIS COUNTRY FOR 56

47:31.000 --> 47:33.866
YEARS AND WHEN YOU SEE A PARTY

47:33.933 --> 47:35.866
THAT HAS SAID OUR GAME PLAN IS

47:35.933 --> 47:36.866
TO HOLD ONTO WHITE POWER AND

47:36.933 --> 47:39.400
THEY BEGIN TO REWRITE THE RULES

47:39.466 --> 47:40.400
IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT HARDER

47:40.466 --> 47:42.066
NOT JUST FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO

47:42.133 --> 47:44.866
VOTE -- I'M VERY CLEAR THIS IS A

47:44.933 --> 47:45.900
BLUNT INSTRUMENT THAT DEFINITELY

47:45.966 --> 47:48.900
IS AIMED AT BLACK PEOPLE AND TO

47:48.966 --> 47:50.333
SO MANY WAYS THAT RACISM WORKS

47:50.400 --> 47:51.900
IN STRUCTURAL RACISM WORKS, ITS

47:51.966 --> 47:53.533
IMPACT ON YOUNG PEOPLE, MARRIED

47:53.600 --> 47:55.333
WOMEN WHO HAVE THE WRONG NAME ON

47:55.400 --> 47:56.033
THEIR BIRTH CERTIFICATES, ALL

47:56.100 --> 47:59.433
THESE THINGS AND IT'S A PART OF

47:59.500 --> 48:00.966
360 LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN

48:01.033 --> 48:01.600
INTRODUCED THIS YEAR TO MAKE IT

48:01.666 --> 48:03.433
HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE, BY

48:03.500 --> 48:06.966
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

48:07.033 --> 48:08.833
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

48:08.900 --> 48:11.033
>> THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF

48:11.100 --> 48:12.166
ALARMISM IN THIS BECAUSE IT'S AN

48:12.233 --> 48:13.133
EFFECTIVE POLITICAL TOOL AND

48:13.200 --> 48:15.033
WHAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY SEEING HIS

48:15.100 --> 48:16.666
INCREASES IN VOTER TURNOUT.

48:16.733 --> 48:19.066
WHAT YOU SEE IN STUDY AFTER

48:19.133 --> 48:20.266
STUDY FIND THAT MEASURES AFTER

48:20.333 --> 48:21.800
MEASURES IN THE GEORGIA LAW DO

48:21.866 --> 48:24.500
NOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL EFFECT ON

48:24.566 --> 48:26.233
POLITICAL TURNOUT -- I WOULD

48:26.300 --> 48:28.333
WELCOME A LEGITIMATE, SERIOUS

48:28.400 --> 48:29.066
CONVERSATION, PERHAPS THESE LAWS

48:29.133 --> 48:30.566
NEED TO BE CHANGED BUT WHAT YOU

48:30.633 --> 48:33.100
ARE SEEING NOW IS ALARMISM THAT

48:33.166 --> 48:34.333
MOTIVATES PEOPLE, MOTIVATES A

48:34.400 --> 48:36.066
SMALL DOLLAR DONORS AND IT WINDS

48:36.133 --> 48:37.933
UP HAVING THE EFFECTIVE

48:38.000 --> 48:38.533
COARSENING THE CONVERSATION.

48:38.600 --> 48:40.333
>> Bill: BUT IT LOOKS LIKE

48:40.400 --> 48:42.433
THIS LAW IS WORKING BACKWARDS

48:42.500 --> 48:43.833
TO -- IF THE ELECTION WE HAD IN

48:43.900 --> 48:46.000
NOVEMBER WAS NOW, HOW COULD WE

48:46.066 --> 48:48.433
HAVE THROWN IT TO TRUMP IN A WAY

48:48.500 --> 48:52.433
THAT WE FAILED IN NOVEMBER?

48:52.500 --> 48:54.000
>> PARTICULARLY PUTTING PARTISAN

48:54.066 --> 48:57.500
PEOPLE IN ELECTION COUNTING.

48:57.566 --> 48:59.733
>> THE PERSON WHO STOOD AGAINST

48:59.800 --> 49:01.933
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TRIED

49:02.000 --> 49:02.433
TO DO --

49:02.500 --> 49:04.466
>> HE'S BEEN REPLACED.

49:04.533 --> 49:06.266
>> HE DEFENDED THE VOTER ACCESS

49:06.333 --> 49:06.466
LAW.

49:06.533 --> 49:08.766
>> Bill: BUT HE'S NOT THERE

49:08.833 --> 49:09.000
ANYMORE.

49:09.066 --> 49:10.566
I'VE GOT TO GO TO NEW RULES,

49:10.633 --> 49:13.500
THANK YOU PANEL, YOU ARE GREAT.

49:13.566 --> 49:16.666
IF NEW RULES!

49:16.733 --> 49:17.633
NEW RULE: IF YOU'RE A RESTAURANT

49:17.700 --> 49:18.400
LIKE THE ONE IN DETROIT THAT'S

ALLOWS YOU TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE

57:12.200 --> 57:13.466
DOING SOMETHING ABOUT A PROBLEM
