WEBVTT

00:07.181 --> 00:10.227
[sad piano music]

00:21.630 --> 00:23.284
- [Carr] But as we
look to the future,

00:23.327 --> 00:26.156
I hope we climb to new heights.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.290
So without further ado, I'm
going to turn the podium over

00:29.333 --> 00:32.683
to our former principle,
Ms. Suzanne Waters.

00:32.728 --> 00:35.035
[clapping]

00:40.127 --> 00:41.171
- [Suzanne] Thank you.

00:41.215 --> 00:42.042
Thank you.

00:46.263 --> 00:50.920
Everyone who's fortunate
enough to reach this day,

00:50.963 --> 00:52.356
knows that it's coming.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.749
- [Voiceover] Love
you doctor Waters.

00:53.792 --> 00:56.491
- [Suzanne] One day
I woke and realized

00:56.534 --> 00:58.580
that this day is here.

00:59.494 --> 01:01.409
So I'd like to
leave you with this.

01:01.452 --> 01:03.498
- [Voiceover] Don't leave.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.543
- God has plans for you.

01:07.110 --> 01:08.503
- Don't waste the
tomorrow's that you have.

01:08.546 --> 01:10.244
- [Voiceover] Paging
Doctor Waters.

01:10.287 --> 01:11.419
- [Suzanne] Chasing
what doesn't matter.

01:11.462 --> 01:13.377
- [David] I gotta go.

01:13.421 --> 01:16.511
- Arguing with the
winning doesn't matter.

01:16.554 --> 01:19.253
Priorities that
no longer matter.

01:21.516 --> 01:22.908
You can do better.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.434
God's north for you.

01:26.477 --> 01:27.696
- [Voiceover] We'll miss you.

01:27.739 --> 01:31.265
- Only needs your
courage to be realized.

01:34.442 --> 01:36.444
Thank you, I'm grateful.

01:37.401 --> 01:40.230
- [Voiceover] Follow your north.

01:40.274 --> 01:42.580
[clapping]

01:47.629 --> 01:50.414
[slow soft music]

01:56.812 --> 01:58.379
- [Voiceover] Pressing a
bandage over the wound.

01:58.422 --> 02:00.424
He's been steadily
losing blood pressure

02:00.468 --> 02:02.470
from his internal injuries.

02:04.428 --> 02:06.082
- He's just a kid.

02:09.607 --> 02:12.306
No exit wound but let's get him
bagged

02:12.349 --> 02:14.743
and on a ventilator right now.

02:16.614 --> 02:19.965
- [Voiceover] He's going
into hypovolemic shock.

02:20.009 --> 02:22.751
- Contact
anesthesiology, put DOR.

02:22.794 --> 02:26.189
- Although Suzanne
Waters is leaving us,

02:26.233 --> 02:28.017
she'll never really be gone.

02:28.060 --> 02:32.543
I know I can never completely
fill the shoes left behind.

02:32.587 --> 02:37.069
You are always welcome
here, at South High.

02:37.113 --> 02:40.290
In one month, she
will add grandmother

02:41.465 --> 02:43.946
to her long list
of accomplishments.

02:43.989 --> 02:46.253
[clapping]

02:48.342 --> 02:51.562
- I'm so sorry David wasn't
able to be here today.

02:51.606 --> 02:54.174
- Oh I know his job's important.

02:55.566 --> 02:57.960
- [Voiceover] He's going in
shock, I need a blood type.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.309
- [Voiceover] One, two.

02:59.353 --> 03:00.136
- [Voiceover] Check
his blood pressure.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.398
- [Voiceover] Three.

03:01.442 --> 03:02.486
- [Voiceover] Blood
pressure elevated.

03:02.530 --> 03:05.185
- 300 CC saline
drips, start now.

03:13.497 --> 03:17.240
[car engine staring]

03:17.284 --> 03:20.200
[breathing deeply]

03:22.811 --> 03:25.335
[heavy rain]

03:40.524 --> 03:42.570
[growling]

03:47.052 --> 03:49.054
- [Jessica] Where is it?

03:55.539 --> 03:57.585
Hold on baby, hold on.

04:06.028 --> 04:08.465
Please baby, just hold on.

04:08.509 --> 04:09.597
It's all right.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.560
[lighting]

04:20.260 --> 04:21.608
Where is my phone?

04:32.228 --> 04:33.577
- [David] Forceps.

04:38.147 --> 04:38.930
Suction.

04:41.019 --> 04:41.803
Spreader.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.633
[heavy rain]

05:00.822 --> 05:03.607
- Please don't hurt
me, I have money.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.830
- Oh man, what's wrong?

05:10.397 --> 05:12.616
- I'm having my baby.

05:12.660 --> 05:13.878
- No, no.

05:13.922 --> 05:16.316
- No, please, I can't drive.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.101
Do you have a phone?

05:40.992 --> 05:43.081
- Go home and stay there.

05:44.518 --> 05:45.997
I'll be right back.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.437
Go home and stay there.

05:51.829 --> 05:52.874
- Go home.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.708
- [Eli] Can you move over?

06:12.415 --> 06:13.634
- [Voiceover] We're
gonna miss you.

06:13.677 --> 06:15.853
- [Voiceover] You
dropped your phone.

06:15.897 --> 06:18.116
- Oh thank you, thank you.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.256
[sad piano music]

06:38.398 --> 06:40.748
- Jessica, my name is Jessica.

06:41.923 --> 06:42.924
- Nice name.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.276
- Are you going
to tell me yours?

06:47.319 --> 06:48.712
- I could but if I did
I'd have to put you

06:48.756 --> 06:52.412
on the side of the
road and take your car.

06:53.848 --> 06:57.504
What makes you think
we're going to a hospital?

07:02.900 --> 07:05.729
I'll take your car after I
deliver you to the hospital.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.035
Payment.

07:07.078 --> 07:09.951
- You are allowed
to take the car.

07:14.956 --> 07:17.132
- Hey, the important thing
is to keep your mind off

07:17.175 --> 07:21.397
that eight pound alien that's
about to pop out of you.

07:22.311 --> 07:23.443
- He's early.

07:24.879 --> 07:27.359
- Preterm as in you
before or after 32 weeks?

07:27.403 --> 07:29.318
- Around there.

07:29.361 --> 07:30.928
- Around there?

07:30.972 --> 07:34.932
Knowing when you're past
preterm is pretty important.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.850
Oddest thing, did you know that

07:39.894 --> 07:41.330
if they transplant a
woman's heart into a man's,

07:41.373 --> 07:43.158
the diameter of the
arteries will increase?

07:43.201 --> 07:45.813
Men naturally have
larger arteries.

07:45.856 --> 07:47.510
You have 60 thousand
miles of blood vessels

07:47.554 --> 07:48.859
and in every rep
blood goes completely

07:48.903 --> 07:51.601
around the body in 60 seconds.

07:51.645 --> 07:53.734
You produce 25 thousand quarts
of spit in your lifetime,

07:53.777 --> 07:54.822
that could fill two pools.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.172
- Where do you get
this stuff from?

07:57.215 --> 07:58.739
- The library.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.871
Thanks to soccer mums, like
yourself, that live in superbia.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.438
It's a good thing
you pay your taxes.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.049
I mean, how entertaining the
conversation with me would be

08:05.093 --> 08:07.399
if I didn't internet access?

08:07.443 --> 08:09.663
[screams]

08:09.706 --> 08:11.752
- [Voiceover] Blood
pressure dropping.

08:11.795 --> 08:12.927
- [Voiceover] Heart
rate dropping.

08:12.970 --> 08:15.669
- [David] Get another
line going on him.

08:15.712 --> 08:16.974
We're loosing him.

08:17.018 --> 08:19.020
- Your brain requires
10% to operate.

08:19.063 --> 08:20.325
You think your brain is
more active during the day

08:20.369 --> 08:21.936
with the rest of your
body but it's not,

08:21.979 --> 08:25.026
it is more active
when you're sleeping.

08:27.724 --> 08:30.466
- No, don't stop, keep
going, keep going.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.860
- 90% of the information you
gain, you gain from sight.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.471
You can't tickle yourself, go
ahead try to tickle yourself.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.342
The reason why your stomach
doesn't destroy itself is

08:37.385 --> 08:40.171
because it produces cells
faster than it can destroy them.

08:40.215 --> 08:42.304
Frequent dreams are
connected to higher IQ.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.785
- You must dream a lot.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.395
- People think wisdom
teeth are a set of teeth

08:46.438 --> 08:47.962
but they're really
just the third molars

08:48.005 --> 08:49.964
largely useless beyond
growing and causing pain.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.226
You'll be about one
centimeter shorter

08:51.269 --> 08:52.140
when you go to bed
at night than you are

08:52.183 --> 08:53.707
when you wake up in the morning.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.144
The cords in your spine
compress throughout the day.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.362
If you're right-handed
you can live

08:57.406 --> 08:58.886
up to nine years
longer than a leftie.

08:58.929 --> 09:01.105
Only humans shed
emotional tears.

09:01.149 --> 09:04.021
Help, this woman's
having an alien.

09:05.153 --> 09:05.893
More people have a
heart attack on a Monday

09:05.936 --> 09:07.198
than any other day.

09:07.242 --> 09:07.982
- [Jessica] Oh thank you.

09:08.025 --> 09:08.896
- [Eli] 20% more.

09:08.939 --> 09:10.158
- You got her here just in time.

09:10.201 --> 09:11.072
You can wait for your
mother over there.

09:11.115 --> 09:13.030
- Oh wait, what's your name?

09:13.074 --> 09:14.815
- [Eli] Babies are
born with 350 bones.

09:14.858 --> 09:16.033
Adults have 206.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.083
- [Policeman] Hey.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.088
Freeze.

09:27.131 --> 09:29.394
I need security backup.

09:29.438 --> 09:30.178
Hey, hey, hey.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.483
- [Eli] Get off me.

09:31.527 --> 09:32.397
- [Policeman] Stop,
do not resist me.

09:32.441 --> 09:34.312
- I wasn't doing anything.

09:34.356 --> 09:36.576
- Give me your other hand.

09:38.099 --> 09:40.754
I need a juvie backup unit
in south visitor's lobby

09:40.797 --> 09:42.712
at Highland General.

09:42.756 --> 09:43.844
- [David] Let's make sure
we've stopped all the blooding

09:43.887 --> 09:44.975
before we close them up.

09:45.019 --> 09:47.021
- [Voiceover] Yes, sir.

09:47.064 --> 09:47.891
More suction.

09:49.240 --> 09:53.027
- [Voiceover] Vitals
are stabilizing.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.638
[phone beeping]

10:03.515 --> 10:04.386
- [Voiceover]
Doctor David Waters.

10:04.429 --> 10:07.041
Leave a message after the tone.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.870
- Hey sweetie, your
bride left her phone.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.873
I'm gonna drop it by, if
you're busy you're busy.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.484
It'd be great to see you.

10:15.527 --> 10:16.659
Love you.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.356
- [Voiceover] All
right, again, on three.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.097
One, two, three.

10:20.141 --> 10:21.577
Push.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.839
- [Voiceover] Keep it up,
you're doing a great job.

10:22.883 --> 10:23.666
- [Voiceover] Come
on Jessica, push.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.277
[growling]

10:26.321 --> 10:28.236
- [David] That's why
I always double check.

10:28.279 --> 10:31.152
- [Voiceover] Doctor Waters,
you're having a baby.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.719
- [David] Are you ready?

10:32.762 --> 10:35.112
- [Voiceover] Oh no, I
don't think I'm ready yet.

10:35.156 --> 10:36.070
- [David] Tell my
wife I'll be there

10:36.113 --> 10:38.289
as soon as I finish up here.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.726
- [Voiceover]
Temperature's back up.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.118
Blood pressure is looking good.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.990
- [Voiceover] Jessica,
we need to get the baby.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.556
We need you to push.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.775
Push.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.037
- [Voiceover]
Heart rate's at 20.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.518
- [Voiceover] It's
gonna be okay, Jessica.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.999
Get my neonatologist down here.

10:53.348 --> 10:54.392
- What's wrong?

10:54.436 --> 10:55.698
My baby.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.004
- [Voiceover] It's
gonna be okay.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.571
- [Voiceover] One,
two, three and push.

11:00.529 --> 11:01.922
- Stand up.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.664
You have the right
to remain silent.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.100
Walk forward.

11:06.143 --> 11:08.276
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

11:08.319 --> 11:10.147
in the court of law.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.414
Watch your head.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.031
- [Voiceover] You
can do it, Jessica.

11:24.074 --> 11:25.467
Baby's in the canal.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.991
You can do it, you're strong.

11:29.689 --> 11:33.083
- [Voiceover] Heart
rate's decelerating.

11:35.129 --> 11:36.521
- [Voiceover] Doctor
Waters, it's your wife.

11:36.565 --> 11:39.002
You need to come now.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.221
- Just keep him
sedated for two hours

11:40.264 --> 11:43.703
in case I didn't get
all of the bleeding.

11:46.183 --> 11:49.186
[screaming in pain]

12:01.895 --> 12:04.071
- What's wrong with my baby?

12:10.773 --> 12:12.557
- [Voiceover] Your baby's
going to get great care.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.255
I know it's not easy.

12:19.086 --> 12:23.699
- [Voiceover] The baby is being
investigated for tetralogy.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.093
He's with a good neonatologist.

12:26.136 --> 12:29.444
He's upstairs in
neonatal intensive care.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.404
[crying]

12:33.448 --> 12:35.711
- [David] Hey come on,
look, we'll be fine, okay?

12:35.755 --> 12:38.235
We're gonna be fine and
the baby will be too.

12:38.279 --> 12:41.673
- [Jessica] You can't
say that with confidence.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.066
- What's going on?

12:44.676 --> 12:46.069
- Based on what?

12:46.113 --> 12:48.202
You heard the doctors.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.943
- Should I leave?

12:49.986 --> 12:50.770
- No.

12:52.206 --> 12:54.730
- Mum, our baby was born
with tetralogy of fallot.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.297
Blue baby syndrome.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.212
- Will it be all right?

13:00.301 --> 13:02.259
- Well, the veins and arteries
are basically swapped,

13:02.303 --> 13:04.740
so it will require
open heart surgery.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.394
It's very serious.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.439
- I'm so sorry.

13:08.483 --> 13:12.704
If there anything I can
do, what can I do to help?

13:14.837 --> 13:17.013
- Listen, my postup is
having complications.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.972
I have to go check on him.

13:19.015 --> 13:22.279
I'll be back to check
on you soon, okay?

13:22.323 --> 13:26.327
- She is not a patient
that you check on.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.198
Get someone else
to take the call.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.679
- Mum look, it's
my patient, okay?

13:30.722 --> 13:32.724
It's just not that easy.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.818
- I'm here for you.

13:42.343 --> 13:43.213
I'm so sorry.

13:54.094 --> 13:57.097
- This boy, he saved
my baby's life.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.231
And possibly mine
the doctor said.

14:01.275 --> 14:04.060
It was a miracle he was there.

14:04.104 --> 14:07.237
Can you do me a favor,
can you find him?

14:07.281 --> 14:08.673
I wanna thank him.

14:10.153 --> 14:11.154
- Of course.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.766
And I'm so sorry.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.127
- I have to do something first.

14:27.170 --> 14:29.346
Just let me go for an hour and
I'll come back here, I swear.

14:29.390 --> 14:30.173
Please.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.092
- [Voiceover] Come on.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.193
Come on kid, let's go.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.253
- No, no, no, stop, stop.

15:06.296 --> 15:07.341
You don't want to do that.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.038
- [Voiceover] Get off me.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.518
- Stop it, come on now.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.215
I'm trying to help you.

15:12.259 --> 15:14.391
- I never asked for your help.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.305
Get off me.

15:22.922 --> 15:27.100
- I feel like I'm sprinting on
a treadmill with these kids.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.981
[water running]

15:51.472 --> 15:53.604
- Congratulations on
becoming a grandma.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.258
- Thank you.

15:55.302 --> 15:57.260
- But for now, while that
baby is being stabilized,

15:57.304 --> 16:00.002
there's no
visitation, I'm sorry.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.308
- I understand.

16:03.919 --> 16:05.399
Seems very serious.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.881
- It is unfortunately.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.974
- Maybe you could point
me in the direction

16:15.017 --> 16:18.412
of the young man that brought
my daughter-in-law in.

16:18.455 --> 16:21.502
- I was told that
he was arrested.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.287
- Thank you.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.907
- I know that was you.

16:38.301 --> 16:39.824
- Oh you knew, huh?

16:41.043 --> 16:44.394
- I can feel you, I
don't have to see you.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.485
- I didn't mean to wake you.

16:48.529 --> 16:51.140
I'm sorry, I got tied up.

16:51.184 --> 16:52.968
- You got busy.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.013
Did it help?

16:57.755 --> 16:59.453
I know you're scared.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.675
It has to be hard, you not
being able to do anything.

17:08.114 --> 17:11.769
I just hope while you're
processing your feelings,

17:11.813 --> 17:13.423
you'll include me.

[sad piano music]

18:35.201 --> 18:36.027
- Oh.

18:37.551 --> 18:38.595
Hi.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.517
- He's gonna make it.

18:56.700 --> 18:57.440
Hi, mum.

18:57.484 --> 18:58.615
- Hi sweetie.

19:00.922 --> 19:04.491
No wonder people get
sick and are overweight.

19:04.534 --> 19:07.450
Look at what you're
eating in here.

19:20.071 --> 19:24.511
Jessica is an amazing woman,
don't take her for granted.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.077
- I see you two
have been talking.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.862
- Mums can see things.

19:32.562 --> 19:35.739
- Mum, I can't deal
with this right now.

19:37.045 --> 19:38.351
Okay, Jessica just
doesn't understand

19:38.394 --> 19:41.441
the requirements of my job.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.443
Let's just leave it at that.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.575
- Jessica is your priority.

19:47.621 --> 19:50.276
Your job's not your life.

19:50.319 --> 19:53.540
- My life's become a
medical dispensary.

19:53.583 --> 19:57.152
I didn't go to med school
to become a soda machine.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.893
[pager beeping]

19:58.936 --> 20:02.244
- Look at you, pager going off.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.767
I remember I'd be sitting
you with your father

20:03.811 --> 20:06.553
while he did visitations.

20:06.596 --> 20:09.338
And wow, now you're here.

20:09.382 --> 20:11.210
All your father
needed was that kidney

20:11.253 --> 20:14.387
for a few extra years
'cause he was so proud

20:14.430 --> 20:18.347
watching you cross that stage,
Doctor David Isaac Waters.

20:18.391 --> 20:19.653
- Okay, mum, that's great.

20:19.696 --> 20:20.697
I gotta go, okay?

20:20.741 --> 20:22.046
Love you.

20:22.090 --> 20:25.528
- Your father healed
hearts inside these walls.

20:27.487 --> 20:28.270
Hearts.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.833
[slow sad music]

21:09.877 --> 21:10.791
I miss you.

21:12.575 --> 21:15.361
[sad piano music]

21:29.810 --> 21:31.812
- Have a sit right here.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.644
- Hi, I'm Suzanne Waters.

21:38.862 --> 21:41.561
I'm the mother-in-law
of the woman you helped.

21:41.604 --> 21:42.736
- I don't need a thanks.

21:42.779 --> 21:44.781
- That's great to hear

21:44.825 --> 21:48.698
because it makes thanking
you that much easier.

21:48.742 --> 21:51.179
Thanks for agreeing to meet.

21:57.620 --> 21:58.752
- How is she?

21:59.840 --> 22:01.102
Jessica, right?

22:02.625 --> 22:04.888
- She's doing very well, Eli.

22:04.932 --> 22:08.501
The doctors say you
saved her baby's life.

22:08.544 --> 22:09.632
- How about it.

22:12.505 --> 22:16.117
- I'm going to find
a way to help you.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.859
- You don't have to bother,
I was stealing her car.

22:18.902 --> 22:20.904
If she wasn't in the beamer,
I'd be at a chopshop right now

22:20.948 --> 22:22.993
and I'd be at Grandrich for it.

22:23.037 --> 22:24.821
- And you wouldn't
have been arrested.

22:24.865 --> 22:27.650
And you and I
wouldn't be talking.

22:28.869 --> 22:31.785
I believe that God
wants me to be here.

22:34.570 --> 22:38.835
If I request to see you
again, will you see me?

22:38.879 --> 22:40.489
- [Voiceover] Attention
guests and residents.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.491
Morning visitation
hours are over.

22:42.535 --> 22:43.753
They'll reopen from 2pm.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.276
- [Guard] Time to go, come on.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.671
- [Voiceover] Again, morning
visitation hours are over.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.728
- I wish that you were here.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.907
Your son had a boy.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.172
They haven't named him yet.

23:13.174 --> 23:15.176
And I made a new friend.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.573
And he's very complicated.

23:27.797 --> 23:29.103
The faucet broke.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.981
- [Pastor] So, I
ended up asking,

23:38.025 --> 23:40.854
"What do we need a 30
foot Christmas tree for?"

23:40.897 --> 23:42.377
[laughing]

23:42.421 --> 23:44.727
- [Suzanne] And it crushed
the roof of that rental truck

23:44.771 --> 23:46.381
when he cut it down.

23:47.513 --> 23:48.905
- [Pastor] What
was Isaac thinking?

23:48.949 --> 23:50.167
- [Suzanne] Well,
he thought that

23:50.211 --> 23:52.779
it would come to rest on
the roof of the truck,

23:52.822 --> 23:56.696
so he wouldn't have to
load it alone in the woods.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.785
- [Pastor] Genius, genius.

23:58.828 --> 24:01.701
- It sank the
tiers into the mud.

24:02.832 --> 24:04.355
Oh my goodness.

24:04.399 --> 24:08.011
You know, whenever I
brought that story up,

24:08.055 --> 24:09.883
he would always say,

24:09.926 --> 24:13.364
"Oh well, you try
driving a 30-foot tree

24:14.975 --> 24:18.935
"on the top of a rental
truck on Interstate 30

24:18.979 --> 24:21.111
"and avoid getting a ticket."

24:21.155 --> 24:22.765
[laughing]

24:22.809 --> 24:24.898
- Greater works than
these shall he do,

24:24.941 --> 24:27.291
because I am going to my Father.

24:27.335 --> 24:31.121
That's how that husband
of yours always lived.

24:37.911 --> 24:41.480
You didn't come here
to talk about Isaac.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.092
- There's this boy.

24:50.924 --> 24:54.841
- That doesn't sound good
and I know that look.

24:56.538 --> 24:59.889
- His name is Eli
and bigger problems

24:59.933 --> 25:02.979
than just a little
trouble at school.

25:09.682 --> 25:11.510
- When Isaac got sick,

25:13.947 --> 25:17.907
I felt, "No Lord, I can't
lead this congregation.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.779
"I just don't have
that special thing,

25:19.822 --> 25:24.044
"that indescribably way that
people just naturally follow."

25:25.915 --> 25:28.265
You know what he said to me?

25:28.309 --> 25:32.095
"God doesn't choose us
because we're confident

25:32.139 --> 25:36.491
"in our preparation to go and
do what he's called us to do.

25:36.535 --> 25:40.713
"He chooses us because he
knows what we're capable of."

25:44.194 --> 25:46.109
Then he handed me this.

25:49.069 --> 25:50.244
His words to me,

25:51.462 --> 25:55.075
"Follow God's north for
your life's calling."

25:59.427 --> 26:02.038
- What I don't need is
more drama in my life, mum.

26:02.082 --> 26:03.953
- You two are my priority.

26:03.997 --> 26:06.956
- Look, he's a criminal, I
don't care if he's only 14.

26:07.000 --> 26:07.783
- 16.

26:07.827 --> 26:08.915
- Worse.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.699
Who are you doing this for?

26:10.743 --> 26:12.005
- Look, that boy showed up

26:12.048 --> 26:13.963
the moment that
Jessica need help.

26:14.007 --> 26:15.269
- Mum I get it,
happy coincidence,

26:15.312 --> 26:17.967
good fortune, we got
lucky, I'm grateful.

26:18.011 --> 26:19.316
But you're being ridiculous.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.841
- I believe it's more
than that, don't you?

26:21.884 --> 26:22.929
- Oh mum.

26:23.930 --> 26:26.889
Mum, who are you doing this for?

26:26.933 --> 26:28.238
- I know what you're implying.

26:28.282 --> 26:31.285
- Okay, great, tell
me if I'm right.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.680
Mum, you are not the
keeper of dad's legacy.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.377
Just let it go.

26:36.420 --> 26:39.206
- Look, I just
came for an update.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.905
Any news, maybe see him.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.867
- Mum, he's going in
for surgery on Monday.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.129
They're running a guide test

26:49.172 --> 26:52.654
to get a better
picture for surgery.

26:52.698 --> 26:55.701
He's just very
vulnerable right now.

26:56.789 --> 26:59.008
One in four don't make it.

27:03.622 --> 27:07.800
Look, I'll try to arrange
a time when you see him

27:07.843 --> 27:12.108
but it will be through
the glass, I'm sorry.

27:12.152 --> 27:13.457
- I understand.

27:14.371 --> 27:16.983
I'll get a prayer chain going.

27:18.071 --> 27:20.116
Did you decide on the name?

27:23.380 --> 27:25.774
- [Voiceover] Doctor Waters.

27:28.908 --> 27:31.301
- You could say it's not fair.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.436
- I have to do rounds.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.309
- So, how are you feeling?

27:42.399 --> 27:45.881
I saw the young boy
that helped you.

27:45.925 --> 27:46.926
- How is he?

27:48.014 --> 27:49.319
Did you get a name?

27:49.363 --> 27:51.365
- His name is Eli.

27:51.408 --> 27:55.630
And I'm not sure why anybody
would want to be in his shoes.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.025
- He seemed spunky and smart.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.506
- He's in jail.

28:04.639 --> 28:07.424
Apparently he's a car thief.

28:07.468 --> 28:10.036
- Seemed all heart to me.

28:10.079 --> 28:11.385
- I think so too.

28:12.603 --> 28:15.171
You are going to
be a great mother.

28:16.999 --> 28:19.610
- You know, the miracle is

28:19.654 --> 28:23.136
that we even
conceived this child.

28:23.179 --> 28:26.182
He keeps telling me that
extra hours put him in line

28:26.226 --> 28:27.749
to friend the ER.

28:29.098 --> 28:33.015
Like that was gonna give him
more time with me, with us.

28:35.626 --> 28:38.020
But don't say anything though.

28:38.064 --> 28:40.066
It will just make it worse.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.807
- Okay.

28:41.850 --> 28:42.851
- Thank you.

28:43.852 --> 28:45.854
I'll talk to him though.

28:47.682 --> 28:49.075
- That kid, Eli.

28:50.293 --> 28:53.644
- Please tell him
how grateful I am.

28:53.688 --> 28:56.952
- There's something about him,
some kind of connect, right?

28:56.996 --> 28:59.781
- Like I knew him,
put me at ease.

29:05.178 --> 29:07.833
I wish I could help him.

29:07.876 --> 29:10.705
- Oh you have
plenty to deal with.

29:13.882 --> 29:15.623
- And I am so scared.

29:18.104 --> 29:20.715
- He's going to be all right.

29:20.759 --> 29:24.850
You just say the word and
I will be here for you.

29:26.677 --> 29:27.461
- I know.

29:30.769 --> 29:31.552
I know.

29:34.207 --> 29:37.079
[slow piano music]

30:06.805 --> 30:08.371
- [Judge] He's going to jail.

30:08.415 --> 30:11.940
There's nothing you
can do to change that.

30:11.984 --> 30:15.726
- It's not mine to
question, it's mine to do.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.208
- I get it, you're one of those.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.255
Life lesson 101.

30:23.560 --> 30:27.738
These kids get saved by
Jesus in prison every day.

30:29.001 --> 30:31.090
And then, when they walk,

30:31.133 --> 30:34.441
they go right back to
the life they know.

30:35.790 --> 30:38.227
All they've ever known.

30:38.271 --> 30:41.230
And then, they're
back in front of me

30:41.274 --> 30:43.711
very soon after getting out.

30:46.279 --> 30:48.585
I'm sorry to be so candid.

30:48.629 --> 30:51.632
Ms. Waters, you
need a wake up call.

30:53.460 --> 30:56.158
[laughing]

30:56.202 --> 30:59.161
- We call that a
come-to-Jesus moment.

31:00.946 --> 31:05.080
I appreciate your
experience and concern.

31:05.124 --> 31:08.344
- Helping someone
doesn't change them.

31:10.781 --> 31:12.261
- Is there a bond that I can pay

31:12.305 --> 31:14.307
so he doesn't have
to stay in jail?

31:14.350 --> 31:15.961
Temporary custody.

31:17.179 --> 31:20.574
Do you recommend that I
hire a lawyer for him?

31:26.754 --> 31:28.190
- All of the above.

31:30.410 --> 31:33.195
[slow soft music]

31:55.565 --> 31:58.090
- So you're hanging in there?

31:59.439 --> 32:01.832
- The average human sheds
600,000 particles a day,

32:01.876 --> 32:04.139
one and half pounds a year.

32:04.183 --> 32:08.404
Imagine how much flesh is
on these floors, this table.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.059
- Understood.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.844
Silly question.

32:13.888 --> 32:16.760
- This is like
county but for kids.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.329
Ever been to county?

32:20.373 --> 32:22.244
- County, which county?

32:23.245 --> 32:25.204
- Yeah, you keep it up kid.

32:25.247 --> 32:27.423
You know she's here to help.

32:29.382 --> 32:33.952
- Do you think you can
sneak me in some bones?

32:33.995 --> 32:34.778
Benjamins?

32:35.954 --> 32:36.737
Scratch.

32:38.217 --> 32:39.000
Cabbage.

32:41.046 --> 32:41.872
- Cabbage?

32:43.135 --> 32:43.962
- Bling.

32:45.137 --> 32:45.964
Money.

32:47.226 --> 32:50.359
I need some favor
from the bug squad.

32:52.405 --> 32:55.060
- I'm sorry but I can't
do anything like that

32:55.103 --> 32:56.975
and I would never do
anything like that.

32:57.018 --> 32:58.715
- Then I was kidding.

33:04.983 --> 33:08.290
- What I can do is
get you out of here.

33:09.509 --> 33:11.467
You would have to be
under my supervision.

33:11.511 --> 33:14.427
Now is that something
that you would want?

33:14.470 --> 33:16.385
- Why would you do that?

33:16.429 --> 33:17.560
- I'm not completely sure.

33:17.604 --> 33:18.997
- Honest answer.

33:21.303 --> 33:23.566
- Okay, I'll get it arranged.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.307
- You don't owe me.

33:29.355 --> 33:32.532
- I'm doing it for
selfish reasons.

33:34.664 --> 33:35.926
- Even better.

33:38.451 --> 33:41.106
- Eli's parents were
killed in a car accident.

33:41.149 --> 33:43.412
No will, no one came forward.

33:43.456 --> 33:46.154
- Oh my, what a startling life.

33:47.329 --> 33:51.072
- It's not an overnight
process to foster.

33:51.116 --> 33:53.466
A home study visit is required.

33:53.509 --> 33:57.339
You have to bring him
to meet with me weekly.

33:57.383 --> 33:59.254
I'll see what I can do
about a special circumstance

33:59.298 --> 34:02.388
but you'll have to be
enrolled in the classes.

34:02.431 --> 34:03.432
- Glad to.

34:03.476 --> 34:04.259
Thank you.

34:07.480 --> 34:11.701
- Ms. Waters, he's been in
foster care since he was 10.

34:13.181 --> 34:14.530
He's never stayed
in the same home

34:14.574 --> 34:16.880
for more than three months.

34:16.924 --> 34:20.928
We lost track of him
for the last 18 months.

34:20.971 --> 34:25.150
Plainly spoken, you're taking
out bail and he's a runner.

34:26.368 --> 34:29.023
You might just be a way
out of juvie for him.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.155
- Understood.

34:31.764 --> 34:33.505
- Did you know he has a sister?

34:33.549 --> 34:34.594
- A sister?

34:34.637 --> 34:35.638
- Yes.

34:35.681 --> 34:37.684
She was four, he was 10.

34:38.946 --> 34:41.295
The unfortunate reality is that

34:41.340 --> 34:45.561
couples are often looking
for kids under four years.

34:46.867 --> 34:49.652
He ran with her the first
time to keep them together.

34:49.696 --> 34:51.524
- Is she in placement?

34:51.567 --> 34:53.482
- Police are looking.

35:05.973 --> 35:09.629
- I'm compelled again
to ask Ms. Waters, why?

35:11.805 --> 35:15.417
- Because I believe
God brought Eli to me.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.117
- Eli.

35:21.293 --> 35:22.163
Ms. Waters--

35:22.207 --> 35:23.382
- Mrs. Waters.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.211
- Excuse me.

35:27.212 --> 35:28.082
Mrs. Waters

35:30.302 --> 35:32.565
is risking a lot to help you.

35:33.566 --> 35:35.568
Do you understand?

35:35.611 --> 35:36.656
- Yes.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.965
- And why should your
yes give me reassurance

35:42.009 --> 35:46.187
that you'll be here on your
court day for grand theft?

35:49.016 --> 35:50.713
- You don't trust me.

35:50.757 --> 35:53.847
Nothing I can tell that
will make you trust me.

35:53.890 --> 35:55.631
My word doesn't mean much

35:55.675 --> 35:59.026
but you can trust in
Mrs. Waters' word.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.507
- That's right.

36:01.550 --> 36:03.465
What is also true is

36:03.509 --> 36:06.033
Mrs. Waters has no experience

36:07.687 --> 36:10.255
in dealing with a
young man like you.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.605
Stealing cars is
wholly different

36:12.648 --> 36:15.216
from a kid skipping classes.

36:15.260 --> 36:18.176
My responsibility is
to the judicial system

36:18.219 --> 36:20.613
and to law enforcement.

36:20.656 --> 36:22.484
So having said that,

36:23.659 --> 36:27.533
your bail is set at $100,000

36:28.621 --> 36:30.057
for flight risk.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.991
[slow sad music]

37:13.492 --> 37:16.103
- I've really done it this time.

37:17.191 --> 37:19.802
Either I'm completely
out of control

37:19.846 --> 37:23.719
or I'm going to learn
the lesson of a lifetime.

37:32.337 --> 37:33.642
- Listen, you seem
like a nice lady.

37:33.686 --> 37:36.123
Don't let this kid use you.

37:36.166 --> 37:37.864
He's very smart.

37:37.907 --> 37:39.300
- Just the same.

37:41.824 --> 37:42.608
- Okay.

37:49.615 --> 37:52.095
- Look, I know it's gonna
take you a while to trust me

37:52.139 --> 37:54.620
but we have to communicate.

37:54.663 --> 37:55.708
Are you hearing me?

37:55.751 --> 37:57.275
- Yes, I hear you.

37:57.318 --> 37:59.189
- Well good, that's a start.

37:59.233 --> 38:00.843
So you have a sister.

38:00.887 --> 38:03.193
- Everyone lies once
a day, that's a fact.

38:03.237 --> 38:06.719
- Can't run from the
truth, that's also a fact.

38:06.762 --> 38:09.330
But the police are
searching for your sister.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.549
Is there anything
that you can tell me

38:10.592 --> 38:12.551
that would help them?

38:13.726 --> 38:14.509
- No.

38:20.646 --> 38:22.517
- This is Eli.

38:22.561 --> 38:23.344
- Wait a minute, I
thought we were gonna

38:23.388 --> 38:24.302
talk about this first.

38:24.345 --> 38:26.129
- [Jessica] Come here.

38:29.655 --> 38:32.832
I never got a
chance to thank you.

38:32.875 --> 38:37.097
- It's like I told your mum,
I didn't intend to help you.

38:38.054 --> 38:39.621
- You can't tickle yourself

38:39.665 --> 38:43.669
and frequent dreaming
is associated with
having a higher IQ.

38:43.712 --> 38:44.974
- Really?

38:45.018 --> 38:47.107
An average person falls
asleep in seven minutes.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.543
Dreaming for 30.

38:49.718 --> 38:52.112
- I didn't know that.

38:52.155 --> 38:54.027
- Look, you know that,
I'm glad everybody

38:54.070 --> 38:58.379
is having fun right now but
this is not a good time.

38:58.423 --> 38:59.815
- They're just useless facts.

38:59.859 --> 39:01.817
- Well, they helped me keep
my mind off of my worries

39:01.861 --> 39:03.906
on the way to the hospital.

39:03.950 --> 39:04.733
Thank you.

39:05.952 --> 39:07.040
- How is your baby?

39:07.083 --> 39:08.650
- Wait a minute, that's private.

39:08.694 --> 39:11.044
- He's fine, thanks to you.

39:12.567 --> 39:14.090
- Any news?

39:14.134 --> 39:16.745
- We are not about to have this
conversation here right now.

39:16.789 --> 39:18.399
- I think I should go.

39:18.443 --> 39:21.315
- Look, you know what, you
did a good thing, okay?

39:21.359 --> 39:24.579
And I'm grateful but right
now is not a good time.

39:24.623 --> 39:26.799
- Well, he's going to be
using your old bedroom.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.017
- My room?

39:28.061 --> 39:29.323
Yeah, okay.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.368
- I just thought it was
right to let you know.

39:30.411 --> 39:31.717
We'll be going.

39:32.761 --> 39:34.241
- Thank you again.

39:34.284 --> 39:35.068
- Sure.

39:40.073 --> 39:41.422
- What is wrong with you?

39:41.466 --> 39:42.945
- Me?

39:42.989 --> 39:46.993
Babe, I see these kids every
day coming through the ER.

39:47.036 --> 39:51.258
My mum doesn't know what
she's getting herself into.

39:56.916 --> 39:59.788
- This was obviously
my son's room.

40:02.617 --> 40:05.315
I'll let you get settled in.

40:05.359 --> 40:09.537
The clothes on the bed are
yours and we can get more.

40:10.712 --> 40:11.713
- Nice.

40:16.805 --> 40:19.721
- Please let me apologize
for my son's behavior.

40:19.765 --> 40:21.767
He is in his 30s, the
age when you think

40:21.810 --> 40:25.423
that every decision
you make is permanent.

40:26.946 --> 40:29.688
When you're his age, you
remember this conversation.

40:29.731 --> 40:33.082
- I don't plan on getting to 30.

40:33.126 --> 40:34.127
- I hope so.

40:39.567 --> 40:40.960
I'll start dinner.

41:50.725 --> 41:53.511
[engine starting]

42:09.701 --> 42:12.573
- Jessica's sleeping
soundly, mum.

42:16.359 --> 42:20.363
I don't know, somehow she's
found peace in all this.

42:20.407 --> 42:22.670
- You just let yourself in.

42:22.714 --> 42:25.455
- Come on, mum, I was worried.

42:25.499 --> 42:26.587
Is he asleep.

42:28.415 --> 42:30.373
- David, I'm still your mother.

42:30.417 --> 42:33.202
- I know, that's
why I was concerned.

42:33.246 --> 42:34.856
- Well, he's gone.

42:36.510 --> 42:37.816
- He's gone, what
does that mean?

42:37.859 --> 42:38.730
He's gone.

42:38.773 --> 42:40.819
- He climbed out the window.

42:40.862 --> 42:42.081
- Did you call the police?

42:42.124 --> 42:43.735
- I'm handling this.

42:43.778 --> 42:45.171
- Mum.

42:45.214 --> 42:46.564
What if he comes
back here at night

42:46.607 --> 42:47.521
and breaks into your house, mum?

42:47.565 --> 42:48.827
- What, like you just did?

42:48.870 --> 42:51.394
- I'm not some misguided youth.

42:52.221 --> 42:53.832
Did you go after him?

42:53.875 --> 42:55.442
- He took my car.

42:59.446 --> 43:01.666
[laughing]

43:06.801 --> 43:07.585
- Naomi.

43:09.282 --> 43:10.065
Naomi.

43:12.067 --> 43:13.112
Naomi.

43:24.993 --> 43:26.212
- What's this?

43:30.782 --> 43:32.435
This is a joke, right?

43:32.479 --> 43:33.654
Mum, you gotta be kidding me.

43:33.698 --> 43:36.309
You put your house, dad's house,

43:37.527 --> 43:40.443
grandma and grandpa's
house for bail.

43:40.487 --> 43:42.881
- It might look
confusing but it's not.

43:42.924 --> 43:46.058
God just hasn't made
it all very clear yet.

43:46.101 --> 43:48.669
- Right, I agree with you there.

43:48.713 --> 43:50.410
- I see we can
agree on something.

43:50.453 --> 43:52.412
- Well, I tell you
what, I guess you will

43:52.455 --> 43:54.936
definitely be downsizing now.

43:57.199 --> 43:58.766
- Watch your tone.

43:58.810 --> 44:01.073
- Look, mum, you're not staying
at your house tonight, okay?

44:01.116 --> 44:01.900
He could come back.

44:01.943 --> 44:03.162
We need to go.

44:03.205 --> 44:06.687
- You take care of
Jessica and your baby.

44:22.747 --> 44:23.573
- Naomi.

44:26.751 --> 44:27.534
Naomi?

44:30.015 --> 44:30.798
Naomi.

44:33.888 --> 44:34.672
Naomi!

44:38.980 --> 44:39.764
Naomi!

44:43.158 --> 44:44.203
Naomi.

44:50.470 --> 44:51.253
Naomi!

44:53.691 --> 44:56.955
- [David] I'm sorry
about your car.

44:56.998 --> 45:01.742
- [Suzanne] I'm not worried,
the police will find it.

45:01.786 --> 45:05.006
- [David] I can't believe
all this is happening.

45:05.050 --> 45:08.270
- [Suzanne] What are
you so afraid of?

45:09.489 --> 45:11.099
- Look, it's just.

45:13.972 --> 45:15.582
I don't know, things
just aren't unfolding

45:15.625 --> 45:18.150
the way I wanted them to.

45:18.193 --> 45:19.717
- You poor thing.

45:24.069 --> 45:26.462
- You know, you just
barrage me when I tell you.

45:26.506 --> 45:29.204
- Yes, when you lie to me.

45:29.248 --> 45:31.554
- Well, you tell me, mum.

45:31.598 --> 45:33.600
- You measure up, David.

45:35.036 --> 45:38.953
You're as good as any
of the rest of them.

45:38.997 --> 45:40.563
And you don't need
a bigger title

45:40.607 --> 45:44.176
to make then see in you
what already exists.

45:46.265 --> 45:48.615
- Forget it, okay?

45:48.658 --> 45:51.096
You're not gonna
listen to me anyway.

45:51.139 --> 45:52.358
Let's just change the subject.

45:52.401 --> 45:56.144
- Mamas can worry
needlessly about their boys

45:56.188 --> 45:59.887
but they also know when
not to worry in silence.

45:59.931 --> 46:00.801
What is it?

46:04.370 --> 46:06.372
- So why are you
helping this kid?

46:06.415 --> 46:08.940
- You're changing the subject.

46:08.983 --> 46:10.942
- It's uncomfortable.

46:10.985 --> 46:12.378
- You tell me why.

46:17.296 --> 46:19.080
- You're scared.

46:19.124 --> 46:20.995
Like the rest of us.

46:21.039 --> 46:22.170
It is somehow about a title

46:22.214 --> 46:25.260
you lose touch with
the purpose in life.

46:25.304 --> 46:28.307
