WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.003
(light music)

00:04.462 --> 00:07.674
Walter, I love you
because you love to laugh.

00:07.757 --> 00:09.300
(soft chuckle)

00:09.384 --> 00:11.845
Lahela, I love you
because you care so much,

00:11.928 --> 00:14.931
like how our heart in the sand
has to be anatomically correct.

00:15.849 --> 00:19.102
And I love you for picking all the shells
out of the right ventricle.

00:19.227 --> 00:21.688
Tricuspid valve stenosis is no joke.

00:22.897 --> 00:25.567
I don't even know what that means,
but I love it because you said it.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.695
Ugh. Yarfo.
We get it, you're a great couple.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.781
Sorry, but I'm in love with Walter,

00:31.865 --> 00:34.617
even if his birthday's next week,
and he's becoming an old.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.078
(cell phone vibrates)

00:37.162 --> 00:38.455
One second.

00:38.538 --> 00:39.664
WALTER: Hello?

00:39.748 --> 00:42.459
Hey. What time were you born?

00:42.542 --> 00:44.210
Not trying to do
your birth chart or anything,

00:44.294 --> 00:45.795
just a normal question.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.590
10:08 p.m. but I'll save you the work.

00:48.673 --> 00:51.926
I'm an Aquarius, Libra rising,
and my moon is in Gemini.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.553
(waves crashing)

00:56.222 --> 00:58.266
-Your brother is the perfect man.
-(scoffs)

00:58.349 --> 01:00.435
Look, teenage boys are morons.

01:00.518 --> 01:01.394
I'm a catch.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.897
One day he'll realize that and we'll spend
the rest of our lives together.

01:07.650 --> 01:08.777
Walter?

01:09.944 --> 01:11.071
What's wrong?

01:11.738 --> 01:13.156
That was the Global Surf League.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.950
They want me to join the tour
this summer in Australia.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.496
-I'm going pro!
-(all cheer)

01:19.579 --> 01:21.748
-Crikey! Oh, my God.
-KAI: What? Dude!

01:21.831 --> 01:24.125
Yeah! I guess they saw me
at that competition last month.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.335
If it goes well this summer,

01:25.418 --> 01:27.253
they could call me up
to the tour full-time.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.255
-Wow, congratulations.
-(Walter sighs)

01:32.383 --> 01:33.802
Two whole months.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.012
Yeah.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.725
But we can make it work.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.895
Yeah. I mean, we're in love.

01:44.521 --> 01:45.814
I hate to leave you, but, I mean,

01:45.897 --> 01:48.024
getting paid to surf
is literally my ultimate dream.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.651
You gotta go for it.

01:49.734 --> 01:53.655
I mean, not everyone gets asked
to join a pro surf tour at 16.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.533
Kinda like getting accepted
into med school at 13.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.827
Eleven, but who's counting?

01:58.910 --> 02:00.328
(chuckles)

02:00.411 --> 02:02.580
(theme music)

02:32.652 --> 02:34.487
<i>♪ Broccoli and batteries ♪</i>

02:34.571 --> 02:36.614
<i>♪ Cabbage on there too... ♪</i>

02:36.823 --> 02:39.409
Did you lose your grocery list again?
Just write it down.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.579
Otherwise, I get your little food ditties
stuck in my head all day.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.790
Sorry, things vanish easily
in my old cargo shorts.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.751
Like my pockets have black holes
or just... holes.

02:48.835 --> 02:52.213
I told you, you need to throw
those shorts away.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.966
But these are my chore shorts, my chorts!

02:55.049 --> 02:56.134
I've had them since college.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.802
They're just so ratty.

02:57.886 --> 03:02.140
It looks like you're in a Dickens novel
about an orphanage for dads.

03:02.223 --> 03:05.101
-(grunts)
-And... done!

03:05.185 --> 03:07.478
Got my plan all set for Walter's birthday.

03:07.562 --> 03:10.607
I want everything to be perfect
before he leaves on his surf tour.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.901
So, I'm going all out for his cake.

03:12.984 --> 03:16.738
I found this baker who does wedding cakes
for all the Waikiki resorts.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.448
(Benny whistles)
Mainlander money.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.784
I mean, I want Walter to love it
so it has to be perfect.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.954
I sent the baker this crude sketch.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.124
It's Walter surfing the barrel
of an almond fondant wave

03:28.208 --> 03:32.712
as the prismatic colors of a never-ending
rainbow kiss the vanilla bean sand.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.589
(grunts)

03:34.672 --> 03:35.757
I could do that.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.259
The surfboards are
Belgian white chocolate truffle.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.470
Belgian?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.307
Hmm.

03:45.850 --> 03:46.976
BENNY: Hey, honey!

03:47.060 --> 03:48.853
Watch this!

03:48.937 --> 03:52.023
(yells)

03:52.106 --> 03:53.858
(laughs)

03:56.361 --> 03:57.779
(chuckles)

03:57.862 --> 04:00.198
-Oh, my...
-Whoo!

04:00.281 --> 04:02.283
Brian Patrick and I built a zip line!

04:02.367 --> 04:04.494
BRIAN: Hey, Mom, check this out!

04:05.495 --> 04:07.872
Oh, go, buddy, go!

04:08.623 --> 04:12.210
-Go, go, go!
-(both laugh)

04:12.293 --> 04:15.463
I'll say this,
the harness is a real man-maker.

04:15.546 --> 04:18.549
See, there's nothing I can't do
in my chorts.

04:18.633 --> 04:19.550
Wanna give it a try?

04:19.634 --> 04:20.635
No way.

04:20.718 --> 04:22.262
Height? Speed? I'm out.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.013
It's a great ab workout.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.057
I gotta get a pump
before I go to Uncle's tonight.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.393
We're gonna do martial arts
and watch Chris Farley movies.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.770
Well, that sounds like
I'll have the house to myself.

04:30.853 --> 04:33.273
The kids are gonna be
at Walter's birthday.

04:33.356 --> 04:36.693
I think it's so sweet that
Lahela wants to make it special

04:36.776 --> 04:38.861
before he leaves for his surf tour.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.780
Yeah, but long-distance is gonna be tough.

04:40.863 --> 04:43.783
Ugh, yeah.
Remember when we first started dating,

04:43.866 --> 04:47.370
and I volunteered at that clinic
in Sri Lanka for two months?

04:47.453 --> 04:49.289
Yeah. It was so cute
how much you missed me.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.582
You would check in every day,
like all the time!

04:51.666 --> 04:54.335
I feel like you checked in more than me.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.586
You still do.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.756
You can't go a day
without checking in multiple times.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.049
(blows air)
What?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.384
Well, it's true!

05:01.467 --> 05:03.428
When you go to Uncle John's later,

05:03.511 --> 05:07.473
I bet you can't go the night
without calling me about something.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.267
You're going to be the one calling me.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.351
Oh, please!

05:10.435 --> 05:12.812
I can't wait to have
this whole house to myself.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.023
-Mm-hmm.
-You wanna bet?

05:15.523 --> 05:19.652
If you check in first,
you have to get rid of your chorts.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.280
Oh, can't believe I just called them that.

05:22.363 --> 05:26.034
Okay, but if you check-in first,
you gotta ride the zip line.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.411
-Eyes open.
-Oh, deal.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.039
A little help with the harness?

05:31.122 --> 05:32.749
I somehow made it tighter.

05:37.962 --> 05:39.213
(Charles sighs)

05:39.297 --> 05:42.633
If we ever get a slow day,
let's erase this stuff and play Hangman.

05:42.717 --> 05:43.968
Oh, I can't spell.

05:44.052 --> 05:44.969
Win, Lose or Draw?

05:45.053 --> 05:46.262
I can't draw.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.680
Well, nothing appropriate anyway.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.267
Room 1, bounced back hernia,
Room 2, stepped on a sea urchin,

05:51.351 --> 05:53.770
Room 3 de-cathed himself
and is moving to Room 4.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.188
Also, stay out of Room 3.

05:55.271 --> 05:58.232
Oh, girl, you're on fire today.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.943
And I still have 11 things to do
before Walter's party tonight.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.279
Things are so crazy,
I have Steph picking up the cake.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.615
Isn't she your friend
who's never had a glass of water?

06:05.698 --> 06:06.866
Yeah, but come on.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.743
I trust her, 100 percent.

06:09.243 --> 06:11.037
Steph, hit me, how's the cake?

06:13.247 --> 06:14.290
Amazing.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.335
I wanna live in it.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.962
It's okay.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.007
Dibs on the surfboard.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.550
Cowa-yum-ga!

06:24.634 --> 06:27.428
Dude, I know how important
this is to you. I got you.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.930
Love you, bye!

06:31.391 --> 06:33.184
I totally could have made this.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.143
No.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.105
Yours would have been better.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.405
If I'd have known
you were gonna grab my arm,

06:45.488 --> 06:47.490
I would have touched the cake
with my butt.

06:50.618 --> 06:55.665
Babe, should I hide my Eagles helmet phone
for my Zoom interview with the board?

06:55.748 --> 06:56.999
I need to be careful.

06:57.083 --> 07:01.254
I mean, what if one of them
is a lowlife Cowboys fan?

07:01.337 --> 07:02.380
That's a phone?

07:02.463 --> 07:03.339
Yeah.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.799
We've eaten nachos out of that.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.217
Yeah.
(chuckles)

07:07.301 --> 07:09.720
Hey, I didn't know
what flavor hummus to get you.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.181
And since I'm not someone
who has to check in,

07:13.182 --> 07:17.562
-I got you... all the flavors.
-Oh, wow.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.274
Garlic rosemary cheddar jalapeño?

07:21.357 --> 07:23.526
-They were swimming in those.
-(chuckles)

07:23.609 --> 07:25.987
Either way, didn't check in.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.780
But you wanted to.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.574
You are so losing this bet.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.325
-We'll see.
-(giggles)

07:31.409 --> 07:32.618
Okay, honey, gotta go.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.537
Talk to you later.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.831
Actually, I won't.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.040
(laughs)

07:38.916 --> 07:39.750
I...

07:40.793 --> 07:42.003
(door opens)

07:42.086 --> 07:44.672
-I guess I'll put away the groceries.
-(door closes)

07:46.132 --> 07:48.551
Sriracha oatmeal raisin?

07:49.218 --> 07:51.596
All right. All right.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.557
Hey, you guys wanna come
to Walter's party?

07:54.640 --> 07:56.142
His aunties are pretty fun.

07:56.225 --> 07:59.270
The oldest one's 80
and the youngest one's, like, 13.

07:59.353 --> 08:02.190
I got to get my costume ready
for The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

08:02.273 --> 08:03.774
That's how people used to watch movies.

08:03.858 --> 08:04.734
In a costume?

08:04.817 --> 08:05.735
In a theater.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.154
Oh, and I've got
my flair bartending class.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.740
I basically paid 50 dollars a pop
to spill on myself.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.533
Afternoon, residents.
(Dr. Lee sighs)

08:12.617 --> 08:13.910
Who wants a special assignment?

08:13.993 --> 08:15.244
Nope. Got to go.

08:16.078 --> 08:17.872
DR. LEE: Dr. Kamealoha. Wait.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.000
Yes, Dr. Lee?

08:21.083 --> 08:24.253
I need you to transcribe the voice memos
I take after my procedures.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.548
Oh, well, I kinda have plans tonight.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.217
So if it's just scut work, can it wait?

08:29.300 --> 08:30.259
Scut work?

08:30.343 --> 08:32.428
Oh, no, no, no.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.846
This isn't just busywork.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.265
This is essential
to your cardiology rotation.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.435
You get to listen to my notes
and write them down,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.938
ingesting and excreting my genius.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.147
Gross.

08:43.231 --> 08:47.068
Or do you not wanna learn from one of
the top ten heart surgeons in the country,

08:47.151 --> 08:48.444
per Delta's in-flight magazine?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.029
Yes, domestic routes only.

08:50.738 --> 08:51.781
Come on.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.158
This is what being a resident is.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.245
Okay, look.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.205
If you need me, do not call.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.999
I have a Tinder date
with a girl who only takes group photos.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.834
Can't wait to find out which blond she is.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.295
Peace out.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.717
(light music)

09:12.426 --> 09:16.138
Okay, ready to ingest genius.

09:18.724 --> 09:21.143
DR. LEE: <i>March 13, 2021,</i>

09:21.227 --> 09:25.815
<i>60-year-old male presents with distal
phalangeal hypertrophic osteoarthropathy,</i>

09:25.898 --> 09:27.775
<i>a.k.a. fingernail clubbing,</i>

09:27.858 --> 09:31.320
<i>a rare symptom
of a serious bacterial endocarditis.</i>

09:31.404 --> 09:35.658
<i>Dude's fingers were wack like E.T.'s,
but no light at the end.</i>

09:35.741 --> 09:37.618
<i>Hey, you know what movie they should do?</i>

09:37.702 --> 09:39.495
E.T. <i>but in reverse.</i>

09:39.579 --> 09:41.539
<i>-Send Elliott to E.T.'s planet.</i>
-What?

09:41.622 --> 09:42.999
<i>I should write that movie,</i>

09:43.082 --> 09:46.127
<i>right after my all-male remake
of</i> Steel Magnolias.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.675
One down, 53 to go.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.474
I mean, honestly,
I do feel a little bit older.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.394
Ladies, ladies,
those streamers need more twist.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.062
Who's that little man?

10:05.771 --> 10:07.481
What's up, doc, you almost done?

10:07.565 --> 10:09.942
(sighs)
No, this is gonna take forever.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.777
Dr. Lee rambles like crazy.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.322
It's like you talking
about meeting Sia at the mall.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.490
She was looking for the Lululemon.

10:17.033 --> 10:17.867
Sorry.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.577
So, how did everything go with the cake?

10:19.660 --> 10:21.078
Fine.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.539
I've got Kai and Brian Patrick
keeping an eye on it.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.875
(whistles)
Boss wants a cake check.

10:28.919 --> 10:31.130
(quirky music)

10:39.180 --> 10:40.431
Well?

10:41.682 --> 10:42.642
Uh...

10:43.893 --> 10:44.894
It's still amazing.

10:45.686 --> 10:48.230
Hurry up and get over here, bye!

10:49.065 --> 10:50.191
How did this happen?

10:52.735 --> 10:54.070
We have to be careful with the cake.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.155
You drive slow, I'll call the potholes.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.490
I'll just sit here.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.158
Pothole, starboard, two o'clock.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.369
(tires screech)

11:05.456 --> 11:08.042
I put my friendship on the line
for this cake.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.795
What sucks is this was us trying our best.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.713
Farewell, my sweet.

11:12.797 --> 11:13.673
Guys, no.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.384
Lahela's working her butt off to get here
so we gotta fix this.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.344
How? It's ruined.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.137
You're a great baker.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.889
You'll rebuild it and we're gonna help.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.894
Okay, truth is,
I've never really made a cake.

11:26.977 --> 11:30.523
I mean, my cookie cakes are straight fire,
but they're more cookie than cake.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.109
Kai, you can do this.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.945
I believe in you,
but you gotta believe in you too, boo.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.363
Cool?

11:38.614 --> 11:40.866
Okay, let's do this.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.495
-(wind gusting)
-(grass rustling)

11:49.542 --> 11:51.752
(calm music)

12:06.726 --> 12:07.643
(grunts)

12:10.604 --> 12:12.732
(upbeat music)

12:17.528 --> 12:19.113
UNCLE JOHN: Your wrists are too tight.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.198
Hang loose!

12:22.575 --> 12:24.994
(upbeat music continues)

12:34.128 --> 12:37.465
UNCLE JOHN: Back in the day,
me and your dad used real swords.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.134
You young guys training
with wooden blades?

12:40.217 --> 12:41.886
Yeah. Didn't Dad lose a finger?

12:42.511 --> 12:43.429
It happens.

12:43.512 --> 12:44.722
(huffs)

12:49.393 --> 12:50.394
(cow moos)

12:50.853 --> 12:51.729
Not bad.

12:51.812 --> 12:52.646
Really?

12:52.730 --> 12:53.814
Almost good.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.734
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said about my training.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.360
I gotta call Clara and tell her!

13:01.947 --> 13:03.532
Oh, never mind.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.826
Well, that's my exercise for a year.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.787
Let's go get a beer.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.581
-You know it.
-BENNY: Whoo.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.212
-<i>This has been a delight, Dr. Hannon.</i>
-(chuckles)

13:16.295 --> 13:18.547
<i>Though I must ask about that basket.</i>

13:19.173 --> 13:20.299
Ooh.

13:20.382 --> 13:21.967
It's Longaberger.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.095
Just gently repping
my home state of Pennsylvania.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.973
<i>Pennsylvania, I'm a huge Eagles fan.</i>

13:28.057 --> 13:31.602
Oh, well then. Take a look at this.

13:31.685 --> 13:34.980
(laughs)
<i>Yes. Go, Birds!</i>

13:35.064 --> 13:36.732
Fly, Eagles, fly!
(chuckles)

13:36.816 --> 13:40.528
<i>Well, I'll see you at the hospital
when I come to deliver our final decision.</i>

13:40.611 --> 13:43.489
<i>But I am hopeful
it's gonna be some positive news.</i>

13:44.490 --> 13:45.574
<i>-Bye now.</i>
-Bye!

13:45.658 --> 13:47.618
-Mahalo. <i>Bye.
-Bye.</i>

13:48.077 --> 13:49.703
(exhales deeply)

13:52.540 --> 13:54.625
(yells)

13:54.708 --> 13:57.545
Yes!
(laughs)

13:57.628 --> 13:59.171
Oh, I can't...

14:01.298 --> 14:03.926
DR. LEE: <i>Okay,
here's another great movie idea.</i>

14:04.009 --> 14:08.722
Star Wars, <i>but instead of in space,
it's on Earth. Earth Wars!</i>

14:09.932 --> 14:12.685
Hey, come on, we'll do this together.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.855
We came back to help you
so you could go to Walter's party.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.606
Oh, guys...

14:17.690 --> 14:19.900
Rocky Horror doesn't start
till midnight anyway.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.819
And I don't wanna kill five hours
at a Starbucks

14:21.902 --> 14:23.988
-dressed as Magenta the castle maid.
-(laughs)

14:24.071 --> 14:25.573
And I guess we can add flair bartending

14:25.656 --> 14:28.158
to the list of things
Tom Cruise can do that I can't.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.538
-(knuckles crack)
-(sighs)

14:33.038 --> 14:34.081

Okay.

15:47.905 --> 15:48.822
(phone vibrates)

15:48.906 --> 15:50.783
Guys, Lahela's on the way.

15:50.866 --> 15:51.825
And...

15:53.202 --> 15:54.119
done.

15:56.288 --> 15:59.291
Wow. Nobody will ever know the difference.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.669
HAPPY BIRTHDAY WALTER

16:01.752 --> 16:02.586
STEPH: You did it.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.254
No.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.715
We did it.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.637
What is wrong with you guys?

16:11.720 --> 16:14.306
Did you accidentally drink
from the adult punch bowl?

16:19.603 --> 16:21.146
How are the children?

16:21.230 --> 16:23.399
Oh, my kids are all doing great,

16:23.482 --> 16:25.901
and Clara's got
a big work interview tonight.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.404
We're giving each other a little space.

16:28.737 --> 16:30.322
I'm not gonna check in.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.408
Won't be easy for Little Benny.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.243
Why you gotta say things like that?

16:34.326 --> 16:35.911
You've always been soft-hearted.

16:35.995 --> 16:36.996
It's a good thing.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.580
You just like to tease me.

16:38.664 --> 16:39.957
I got that from your dad.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.043
He used to hide my shoes
and make me late for school.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.294
(laughs)

16:44.378 --> 16:46.922
We'd also build huts down on the beach.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.757
Now, Hawaii is so different,

16:49.341 --> 16:53.095
the only huts left
on the island sell sunglasses.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.054
And pizza.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.764
(both chuckle)

16:55.848 --> 17:00.644
You know, your dad is the one
that taught me how to play the ukulele.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.347
Phew.

17:39.975 --> 17:43.395
Come on, let's put on Tommy Boy
and get this party started.

17:43.479 --> 17:46.607
But you'll have to figure out
the Wi-Fi for streaming.

17:46.690 --> 17:50.444
Oh, shoot, I always check in with Clara
for stuff like that.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.362
She's the Geek Squad of our marriage.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.573
It's okay, I'll dust off my DVDs.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.743
I have a Tae Bo workout and Garden State.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.078
Let's go.

18:01.955 --> 18:03.082
No, thank you, Auntie.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.084
No, I mean,
I've had so much poke. It's okay.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.753
-Oh, my girlfriend! You made it!
-(Lahela chuckles)

18:08.212 --> 18:10.005
It was nothing. Happy birthday.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.424
(cell phone vibrates)

18:12.508 --> 18:13.717
Oh, it's my dad.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.469
I've lost enough "you time" tonight.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.137
So, ready for your cake?

18:19.181 --> 18:21.350
I went all out, so I hope you love it.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.851
I'll love anything from you.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.478
-(groans)
-Just twisting that knife.

18:24.561 --> 18:25.604
-STEPH: This is it.
-Hey.

18:25.687 --> 18:26.688
I'ma lose my best friend.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.816
I might as well have put
Walter's severed head in a box.

18:28.899 --> 18:29.858
We need a distraction.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.527
Think fast! Lahela's friendship
means everything to me.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.487
I can't lose her. Not because of a cake.

18:35.781 --> 18:36.657
(exhales deeply)

18:36.740 --> 18:37.741
Whoa.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.034
(sighs)

18:43.080 --> 18:45.082
-Uh...
-(cell phone vibrates)

18:45.165 --> 18:46.583
It's my dad again.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.836
He's called, like, four times.
Take a hint, boomer.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.879
Maybe you should call him back.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.089
Four times is a lot.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.340
(sighs)

18:57.845 --> 18:58.762
Nothing.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.974
He's at our uncle's,
and he gets terrible reception.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.225
We should go check on him.

19:03.934 --> 19:04.935
It's your birthday.

19:05.018 --> 19:07.104
When was the last time that
your dad called you four times in a row?

19:07.187 --> 19:08.480
He's a pretty chill guy.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.648
What if something's wrong?

19:11.358 --> 19:12.693
Hey, come on, I'll drive.

19:12.776 --> 19:13.986
I can see my auntie
making me another plate.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.863
I wanna save some room for dessert.
(chuckles)

19:18.198 --> 19:19.366
(grunts)

19:19.449 --> 19:20.951
That was close.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.662
(mumbles)

19:25.205 --> 19:26.248
Um-hm.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.001
That...

19:32.796 --> 19:33.714
Dad?

19:35.132 --> 19:36.258
Lahela, Walter.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.135
Help us settle a bet.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.804
Is that a young Vin Diesel
with hair in the back row?

19:40.888 --> 19:44.183
Dad, what is going on?
You called me like 100 times.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.894
Sorry. I just wanted some help
with the Wi-Fi here.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.645
(sighs)
Then just call Mom.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.397
I'm surprised this place has Wi-Fi.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.150
I mean, I saw more chickens
than cars on the way up here.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.943
Hey, Lahela.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.403
MAN (on TV): <i>Go, last one, go.</i>

19:56.486 --> 19:57.905
How is my girl?

20:00.532 --> 20:01.658
(TV stops)

20:01.742 --> 20:03.785
Uncle, are you okay?

20:05.287 --> 20:07.122
Uncle, talk to me, how are you feeling?

20:07.664 --> 20:09.625
Shortness of breath...
(sighs)

20:09.708 --> 20:11.877
There's red spots in your eyes.
You look pale.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.003
Do you feel weak?

20:13.086 --> 20:14.922
Maybe a little dizzy.

20:15.505 --> 20:16.590
Dehydrated.

20:16.673 --> 20:20.052
Probably why I've been playing the ukulele
without any soul.

20:20.135 --> 20:23.096
Like I'm a quirky white girl.

20:24.806 --> 20:26.391
Uncle, can I see your hands?

20:28.185 --> 20:29.311
Fingernail clubbing.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.982
Come on, we gotta go to the hospital. Now.

20:34.691 --> 20:37.778
-BENNY: Uncle, here. Let me help you.
-Hi, this is Dr. Kamealoha.

20:37.861 --> 20:41.657
I'm bringing in an 82-year-old male,
possible bacterial endocarditis.

20:43.742 --> 20:46.411
(cell phone vibrates)

20:46.495 --> 20:47.663
(soft chuckle)

20:48.747 --> 20:49.790
(clears throat)

20:49.873 --> 20:50.832
Aha!

20:50.916 --> 20:52.501
I knew you'd check in first.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.086
We're taking Uncle to the hospital.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.838
Lahela says it's a heart emergency.

20:56.922 --> 20:57.839
What?

20:57.923 --> 21:00.008
Oh, okay, uh, I'm on my way.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.176
Oh.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.889
(light music)

21:11.603 --> 21:12.896
(sighs)

21:16.024 --> 21:16.900
It'll be okay.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.570
You know, Uncle's got
the best doctor in the world.

21:20.654 --> 21:21.488
(soft chuckle)

21:22.656 --> 21:23.532
LAHELA: Okay.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.330
(sighs)
I ran an echocardiogram.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.415
You're right.

21:31.498 --> 21:32.708
Bacterial endocarditis.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.168
We can treat the infection
with antibiotics,

21:35.252 --> 21:37.796
but... I saw a vegetation.

21:37.879 --> 21:39.840
-Where?
-Aortic valve.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.426
Severe infection.
Probably need to replace the valve.

21:42.509 --> 21:43.760
We're going to OR-2.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.972
Good thing you called me in,
even if it did ruin my night.

21:47.055 --> 21:49.933
Sorry if I blew your chance
with the mystery blond from Tinder.

21:50.017 --> 21:53.854
Turned out she was the cute one,
and she seemed really nice, too.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.649
But you're hospital fam,
and he's your actual fam.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.860
And hey, this is the job.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.826
You are in great hands, Uncle.

22:10.912 --> 22:12.122
<i>Mahalo.</i>

22:22.758 --> 22:23.800
Happy birthday?

22:24.301 --> 22:25.427
(soft chuckle)

22:29.306 --> 22:30.432
I'm sorry.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.267
It's fine.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.853
Family first, right?

22:34.936 --> 22:37.397
Thank you for making me
go check on my dad.

22:37.939 --> 22:40.150
I mean, if we hadn't gone up there...

22:41.693 --> 22:43.445
He'd never get his Wi-Fi working.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.613
(chuckles)

22:48.283 --> 22:50.577
I wanted your birthday to be amazing.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.996
I mean, you work so hard on your surfing

22:53.080 --> 22:55.665
and now you get to go
on this big adventure.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.042
(sighs deeply)

22:57.125 --> 23:00.504
The harder I work at the hospital,
the more I'm destined to never leave.

23:00.587 --> 23:01.463
But...

23:02.798 --> 23:04.508
you get to see the world.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.844
And I'm so proud of you.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.805
(both chuckle)

23:10.764 --> 23:12.766
So, I wanted your day to be special.

23:14.226 --> 23:18.563
Lahela, any time
that I spend with you is special.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.025
Come here.

23:29.699 --> 23:30.909
Benny!

23:31.535 --> 23:33.745
(exhales)
I'm so sorry.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.080
Are you okay?

23:40.168 --> 23:41.461
I'm worried about Uncle.

23:43.046 --> 23:44.840
He's the last one of that generation.

23:46.174 --> 23:49.010
The last one that can talk story
about my dad...

23:50.303 --> 23:53.390
back when they were kids,
what the island used to be like...

23:53.473 --> 23:54.724
Oh, honey.

23:55.892 --> 24:00.355
Okay, I, I, I talked to Dr. Lee,
and the prognosis is good.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.023
(deep inhale)

24:02.566 --> 24:03.984
(sighs, sobs)

24:04.067 --> 24:06.027
Yeah, honey.

24:06.778 --> 24:07.988
It's okay.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.742
-I guess I lost the bet.
-(laughs)

24:12.826 --> 24:16.455
Oh, Benny. You had to call me.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.124
Yeah, but I wanted to call you
before then, too.

24:19.207 --> 24:20.584
Well, I did, too.

24:21.501 --> 24:23.336
I've been wanting to call you all night.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.422
(both chuckle)

24:25.922 --> 24:27.299
I like a check-in.

24:27.382 --> 24:28.717
Me too.

24:29.926 --> 24:32.179
So let's just always check in.

24:32.679 --> 24:37.726
Or better yet,
let's just never be apart for too long.

24:40.187 --> 24:41.188
Okay.

24:48.528 --> 24:49.571
Let's go.

24:49.946 --> 24:52.324
Yeah, let's go check on them.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.912
Thanks for taking care of the cake, guys.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.121
It means a lot to me.

24:58.747 --> 24:59.915
BOTH: Yep.

24:59.998 --> 25:03.376
And Walter, I went a little over-the-top,
so don't be embarrassed.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.295
Shouldn't be a problem.

25:11.718 --> 25:14.304
Steph, what happened?

25:14.387 --> 25:17.432
Sorry, we tried to be so careful, I swear.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.142
And then we spent all day trying to fix it

25:19.226 --> 25:23.438
and Kai was awesome,
but... I totally let you down.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.400
If it wasn't for Steph,
then we wouldn't have even tried.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.904
I guess making
a super detailed sculptural cake

25:30.987 --> 25:33.114
is more complicated than you think.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.367
(laughs)

25:35.450 --> 25:37.035
I don't know. I kinda love it.

25:39.412 --> 25:40.372
You do?

25:40.956 --> 25:41.831
Yeah.

25:42.499 --> 25:46.169
Guys, <i>mahalo. Mahalo nui loa.</i>

25:46.503 --> 25:47.546
I love it.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.758
I mean, you put so much thought into it,
and these guys worked so hard to fix it.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.511
This is the best birthday gift ever.

25:55.428 --> 25:57.472
(all chuckle)

25:59.558 --> 26:05.063
I know you wanted it to be perfect
before I left, and, yeah, it kind of is.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.404
Thanks for believing in my baking.

26:12.487 --> 26:15.532
And quick thinking
on your kiss distraction.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.784
Kiss-traction?

26:20.036 --> 26:23.081
Smart, even if you didn't really mean it.

26:25.625 --> 26:26.668
Yeah.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.130
(exhales deeply)

26:32.507 --> 26:33.466
Easy procedure.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.427
In and out, all his vitals are great,

26:35.510 --> 26:37.721
and once the drugs wear off,
you can see him.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.306
Thank you, Dr. Lee.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.390
Of course.

26:40.473 --> 26:41.725
Dr. Kamealoha,

26:43.059 --> 26:44.978
you saved his life by bringing him in.

26:45.061 --> 26:47.188
I only did that because of your notes.

26:47.689 --> 26:50.066
So, in a way, you saved his life.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.653
Yeah, I like that better.

26:53.737 --> 26:54.988
(scoffs)

26:57.073 --> 27:01.369
Mom, I'm starting to think
Dr. Lee isn't as evil as I thought,

27:01.453 --> 27:02.996
and it's messing with my worldview.

27:03.079 --> 27:05.707
He's a worthy opponent for Chief of Staff.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.126
Don't underestimate him.

27:08.209 --> 27:10.712
Being a jerk is a clever disguise.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.672
Hey, what about your big interview?

27:13.548 --> 27:14.716
I think...

27:15.133 --> 27:16.926
Mama crushed it!

27:17.010 --> 27:19.137
(all laugh)

27:21.765 --> 27:23.642
-Congratulations!
-Oh, I wanted to call you

27:23.725 --> 27:24.559
as soon as it happened.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.602
I wish you would have.

27:25.685 --> 27:28.104
We could never survive long-distance now.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.648
Thankfully, we'll never have to.

27:29.731 --> 27:32.400
(Clara chuckles)

27:33.693 --> 27:35.153
BENNY: Yes!

27:35.236 --> 27:37.238
(indistinct chatter)

27:42.452 --> 27:46.581
You know, when you're a doctor,
there's never enough time.

27:47.582 --> 27:52.587
Patients, tests,
seemingly pointless scut work.

27:53.421 --> 27:56.091
It all pulls you away
from the people you love.
