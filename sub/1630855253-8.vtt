00:18.268 --> 00:19.936
<i>Previously on </i>Manifest…

00:20.020 --> 00:21.479
Subject three only.

00:22.772 --> 00:24.566
Hostages? How could you?

00:24.649 --> 00:25.608
How could <i>you?!</i>

00:25.692 --> 00:29.029
What's the point of a powerful mutation

00:29.112 --> 00:32.991
if you can't replicate and weaponize it?

00:33.074 --> 00:35.577
-You're a father, yes?
-A boy and a girl.

00:35.660 --> 00:39.164
Can you imagine
not being able to save your own child?

00:39.247 --> 00:41.124
I am trying to protect my kid, damn it!

00:41.207 --> 00:43.126
I'm your kid too, Dad.

00:45.920 --> 00:49.340
It's like whenever humans have been
in communication with the divine,

00:49.841 --> 00:51.384
it was thanks to sapphire.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.136
There's someone I'm helping,

00:53.219 --> 00:55.555
and I don't know
if I should be helping her.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.265
I'm looking for Angelina.

00:57.348 --> 01:01.519
May this holy ordinance cleanse the soul
and redeem you in his name.

01:02.103 --> 01:02.937
Amen.

01:06.024 --> 01:08.693
We've got about two minutes
till the Registry shows up.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.362
This is hard, but I need to know
what Violet said to you last night.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.282
Anything that can help us understand
why Angelina's mom targeted her.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.619
Look, Cal, if we catch Noelle,
we clear your name.

01:17.702 --> 01:22.874
Angelina, uh… Violet told me that
she helped her with baby stuff, I think.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.709
Noelle's targeting anyone
who helped Angelina.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.253
-Picked her up as soon as I got the text.
-What's going on?

01:27.337 --> 01:29.005
Cal! We gotta go. Get in the car.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.216
-Stop. We gotta talk about this.
-We don't have time.

01:31.299 --> 01:34.844
The evidence is circumstantial at best.
If he goes in and answers the questions--

01:34.928 --> 01:37.430
What? And let them take his prints?
Track his DNA?

01:37.514 --> 01:40.141
-Yes.
-Years of protecting his real identity.

01:40.225 --> 01:43.603
-Running makes him look guilty.
-And staying makes him a lab rat.

01:43.686 --> 01:47.398
When they find out Gabriel is Cal
5.5 years older, they'll never let him go.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.818
Maybe talk to your dad
about your symptoms.

01:49.901 --> 01:50.735
I'm fine.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.237
I sense something more.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.197
You sense
me finding out Violet was murdered

01:54.280 --> 01:56.116
and not wanting to be arrested for it.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.158
One minute.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.326
Cal!

01:58.910 --> 01:59.744
Car. Now.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.621
-What? Did you get the picture?
-What picture?

02:01.704 --> 02:03.414
I told you I need the picture by my bed--

02:03.498 --> 02:05.208
828 Registry! Open up!

02:05.291 --> 02:06.459
-Go! Go! Go!
-Open up!

02:06.543 --> 02:07.877
-Run!
-Police!

02:07.961 --> 02:09.838
-Let him go! Get off of him!
-No, Ben!

02:09.921 --> 02:12.549
Hey! He's under arrest.
Stand back.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.175
I said stand back!

02:14.259 --> 02:15.969
-Come on.

02:16.052 --> 02:19.097
Don't say anything, okay?
I'll be right behind you.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.558
I'll be right behind you!

02:28.606 --> 02:30.984
If Noelle is targeting people
that were harboring Angelina,

02:31.067 --> 02:32.735
we need to know who's next on that list.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.947
I've got Drea looking for leads
for everyone who was at the compound.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.699
We need to make sure
everyone here is safe.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.284
We took in Angelina before anyone else.

02:39.367 --> 02:42.203
They'll cancel our protective detail
now they think they found the killer.

02:42.287 --> 02:45.498
I'll stay put until I get a buddy
from the 129 to watch the house.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.625
Then I'll check Noelle's
and make sure she's there.

02:48.459 --> 02:51.588
Drea got a hit on Adrian's credit card.
Metro Motel, Sunnyside.

02:51.671 --> 02:54.841
-Adrian had Angelina at the compound.
-Yeah, exactly.

02:54.924 --> 02:57.427
If there's anyone
Noelle's gonna go after next, it's Adrian.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.596
Okay, I'm gonna go check out the hotel.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.557
What? You think you're going alone?

03:09.147 --> 03:12.817
Excuse me! Excuse me!
That young man has done nothing wrong.

03:14.777 --> 03:15.778
Mr. Stone.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.117
Capt. Fahey. They brought me from DC
to take command of the Registry.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.203
How do you arrest a kid
because he knows the victim?

03:23.286 --> 03:24.996
Gabriel was the last one seen with Violet

03:25.079 --> 03:28.166
after having what appeared to be
an aggressive exchange.

03:28.249 --> 03:31.502
Mr. Stone, please.
We're gonna run his prints and DNA.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.754
We're gonna question him.

03:32.837 --> 03:35.131
If he's done nothing wrong,
he's got nothing to hide.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.507
All right. All right.

04:20.718 --> 04:21.970
Help!

04:22.720 --> 04:23.930
Save me!

04:24.555 --> 04:29.060
Adrian!

04:40.446 --> 04:41.281
Uh…

04:48.830 --> 04:51.124
Something tells me
he's not just going for ice.

04:59.632 --> 05:00.967
There's chloroform on this.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.722
Noelle stabbed all her victims
at the scene.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.724
She must have something special
in mind for him.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.060
What are you doing here?

05:11.561 --> 05:12.895
I'm staying two doors down.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.772
His farm blew up. I felt bad.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.691
No Four Seasons,
but it's the least I could do.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.443
The room's under his credit card.

05:18.526 --> 05:21.654
I pay the nightly. Incidentals are on him.
Like I said, it's the least I could do.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.825
He's on the level. You can tell him.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.829
We think Adrian was taken
by Angelina's mom.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.456
She's the one killing passengers.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.875
Do you seriously think
she's the 828 serial killer?

05:33.958 --> 05:36.711
Yes. We think she's targeting anyone
who helped Angelina.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.756
-I helped Angelina. Ish.

05:39.839 --> 05:43.634
And I was at mommy dearest's house.
She knows my face, my name.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.513
-Well, lock your door and lie low.
-Noelle's probably coming back for me.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.932
-I need to go with you.
-I'm sorry. There's nothing--

05:50.016 --> 05:53.728
Your whole deal is helping passengers.
It doesn't get more passenger-y than me!

05:53.811 --> 05:55.521
You are not staying at our house, okay?

05:55.605 --> 06:00.735
I had a Calling! Just a minute ago.
Heard Adrian's voice say, "Save me."

06:00.818 --> 06:04.197
That's why I came here to check on him.
I can help you find him.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.325
He's still telling the truth.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.622
-There's always the couch downstairs.
-Well, he's for sure on my kill list.

06:14.665 --> 06:16.376
Don't expect a mint on your pillow.

06:19.295 --> 06:22.256
You talking like a straight-up couch?
Or you got a hide-a-bed?

06:25.009 --> 06:26.719
Sugar rush in the break room.

06:27.887 --> 06:31.432
Damn it, Mikami.
I thought we were friends.

06:31.516 --> 06:35.228
Friends don't let friends miss out
on red velvet because of a stupid diet.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.297
Hey.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.467
I'm all over Noelle.
Running plates, credit cards.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.469
Her family's
in the debris hauling business.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.055
They got contracts with construction sites
all over the boroughs.

07:11.139 --> 07:15.351
Could be hiding out anywhere. This…
this is the address of the headquarters.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.269
Is that him?

07:17.562 --> 07:18.604
-Yeah.
-Okay.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.859
Excuse me, sir. Jared Vasquez, 129.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.068
I know who you are.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.780
Sir, with all due respect,
you have an innocent kid on ice in there.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.241
You should look at Noelle Meyer.
That woman has a history--

07:30.324 --> 07:33.286
Know your place, Vasquez.
We have a suspect.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.037
Leave it,
or I'll have to call your captain,

07:35.121 --> 07:37.165
let him know
you're messing with 828 affairs, okay?

07:44.547 --> 07:45.548
Why do you keep moving me?

07:45.631 --> 07:47.258
We need to keep you safe, Angel.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.302
You said the last place was safe.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.564
-Mom, what did you--
-He led you astray.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.400
Soon, you'll watch
as he's cleansed from the world

08:04.484 --> 08:07.236
like the others
who made you abandon God's path.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.237
Wha--

08:13.201 --> 08:14.785
You aren't hiding me.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.996
You aren't keeping me safe.
I'm your prisoner.

08:17.079 --> 08:17.955
No!

08:18.456 --> 08:19.790
Sh, sh, sh, sh!

08:20.291 --> 08:21.626
It's okay, sweetie.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.931
-What's happening? Where is he?
-Still in questioning.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.557
I got rid of the fingerprint file.

08:36.641 --> 08:38.476
-That's great.
-Bought us a couple hours.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.103
They'll reprint him
once they realize the file's missing.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.356
What I'm more worried about
is the DNA sample.

08:43.439 --> 08:45.608
The lab tech's gonna be here soon
to take the blood draw.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.860
-Can't you lose that sample too?
-No.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.697
DNA has a different chain of custody.
It's right from the tech to the lab.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.450
You have to get him out of here
before that tech shows up.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.911
-I'm sorry. I can't do more.
-Thanks.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.921
Heard from Michaela.

09:07.004 --> 09:09.298
They think the killer
is Angelina's mother.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.135
Is there anything that we can do?

09:13.219 --> 09:15.346
Until there is,
we should focus on our work here,

09:15.429 --> 09:17.431
which I suspect is about to pick up steam.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.891
You got a visitor.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.606
Dr. Gupta, thank you for coming.

09:26.983 --> 09:31.028
I saw your signature
on the detainees' records.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.532
I had no idea you'd been caring for them.

09:34.615 --> 09:38.494
I feel tremendous guilt
about what happened to those poor souls.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.580
A failure and a tragedy.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.249
Maybe not a complete failure.

09:43.791 --> 09:47.503
I think the detainees are stuck
in a constant state of Calling,

09:47.587 --> 09:51.591
and I'm hoping you can help me
safely replicate the major's protocols.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.635
Those detainees may never recover.
You wanna replicate this?

09:54.719 --> 09:56.554
I wanna know how she did what she did

09:56.637 --> 09:59.807
because I wanna avoid making her mistakes,
not repeat them.

10:04.895 --> 10:08.107
I copied her files
before we were locked out of Eureka.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.880
Don't bother.
Your mom's not messing around.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.427
She's the one
who's been killing the passengers.

10:36.510 --> 10:38.804
Yeah, no shit. The question's why?

10:40.890 --> 10:43.184
Anna. Sam.

10:44.518 --> 10:47.605
Ugh, I confessed to my mother
how they helped me.

10:48.230 --> 10:51.442
She must blame any passenger
she thinks led me astray…

10:53.486 --> 10:55.154
and you've helped me the most.

10:56.447 --> 10:57.948
So why hasn't she already killed me?

10:58.032 --> 11:01.994
She wants to rid sinners from my life.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.665
She wants me to watch you die.

11:09.919 --> 11:13.464
Unless you wanna see that, we gotta find
a way out before she comes back.

11:15.591 --> 11:18.886
-You guys don't look like the movers.
-Uh, no, we're here to see Noelle Meyer?

11:19.970 --> 11:23.808
You're not gonna find her here.
Noelle sold off all our projects.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.601
Laid off the staff without notice.

11:26.477 --> 11:30.564
I worked for her father for 30 years.
She inherits the company, guts it in five.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.193
Look. We have reason to believe
Noelle may be using one of her job sites

11:34.276 --> 11:35.486
for criminal activity.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.614
Can we possibly look at the project files?

11:39.907 --> 11:41.033
Do you have a warrant?

11:42.618 --> 11:43.577
No, we do not, but…

11:44.245 --> 11:48.708
Good. Then this never happened.
Come on inside. Look at whatever you want.

11:53.337 --> 11:56.590
Oh, wow. Okay. Uh…

11:57.717 --> 11:59.844
Only 10,000 project files.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.055
This'd be a great time
for you to get one of those Callings.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.473
Yeah.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.607
-This one. Marko's scan.
-Hmm.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.318
It looks just like…

12:18.738 --> 12:21.240
a passenger's Calling I recorded on fMRI.

12:21.323 --> 12:24.243
Yes, it would. That was the first Calling
the major recorded

12:24.326 --> 12:26.203
before the experiments began.

12:32.668 --> 12:34.211
You knew about sapphire all along?

12:34.295 --> 12:36.630
The major did. I was a fly on the wall.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.842
She used sapphire to generate Callings.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.719
Wait. What does this note mean?

12:41.802 --> 12:44.847
"Failed to procure preferred grade.
Used commercial sapphire."

12:44.930 --> 12:46.974
What other kind of sapphire is there?

12:47.057 --> 12:49.560
The major was better at giving orders
than explanations.

12:49.643 --> 12:52.313
But whatever sapphire she was using,
it got results.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.901
This is a drawing Marko made
of what he saw in his Calling.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.278
The major was desperate
to find out what it meant.

12:59.361 --> 13:03.532
She generated a Calling repeatedly,
increasing the intensity each time.

13:08.078 --> 13:12.833
She intentionally increased the charges,
which… increased his pain.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.835
The more pain, the clearer the Calling.

13:14.919 --> 13:18.130
Okay. What if there's a way
to get passengers to the same place

13:18.214 --> 13:19.840
without extreme levels of pain?

13:19.924 --> 13:21.509
That would be a breakthrough, but--

13:21.592 --> 13:23.803
The major just didn't know when to stop

13:23.886 --> 13:26.597
because she thought of passengers
as lab rats.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.391
But I am a passenger.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.644
I won't let that happen.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.818
Those hash browns
aren't gonna eat themselves.

13:38.901 --> 13:39.985
All yours.

13:42.238 --> 13:45.324
How'd you sleep? Any repeats
of the Calling from last night?

13:45.407 --> 13:47.368
Callings don't exactly come on demand.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.662
Besides, my ass was too busy
playing whack-a-mole

13:49.745 --> 13:52.289
with the springs on that couch
to focus on anything else.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.962
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>We were right about the sapphire.</i>

13:58.045 --> 14:02.508
I just… I didn't know how to use it,
but the major did, and she left a roadmap.

14:02.591 --> 14:04.844
To what? Generate Callings?

14:04.927 --> 14:07.972
It seems that she was searching
for some kind of significant sapphire.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.098
I'll send you the info.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.725
God, imagine how easy it would be
to save the Lifeboat

14:11.809 --> 14:14.228
if we could safely generate Callings
when we need them.

14:14.728 --> 14:19.859
It's so funny. Eagan was literally just
saying how Callings don't come on demand.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.236
Wait. You're with Eagan?

14:23.445 --> 14:28.033
Yeah. He had a Calling last night
about Adrian being in danger, so…

14:28.951 --> 14:31.829
If someone recently had a Calling
about the killer or one of the victim's,

14:31.912 --> 14:37.293
I could… regenerate
or… possibly enhance that Calling.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.377
<i>So,</i>

14:39.253 --> 14:41.797
you wanna give Eagan a Calling?

14:41.881 --> 14:44.633
<i>If Callings are memories,</i>
<i>who better to generate one than a guy</i>

14:44.717 --> 14:46.051
<i>with a photographic memory?</i>

14:46.135 --> 14:48.554
It might just save Adrian's life.

14:48.637 --> 14:49.847
And Cal's.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.599
Definitely worth the risk.

14:52.808 --> 14:56.145
Whatever science experiment
you just signed me up for, hard pass.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.771
Ah, well, it has to be you.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.815
You had a Calling about Adrian
for a reason.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.943
People are dying. Never too late
to do the right thing, Eagan.

15:03.444 --> 15:04.862
I always do the right thing.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.031
The right thing for me.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.248
It was my great-grandfather's compass.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.792
The compass took a bullet
for your grandpa at Normandy.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.128
Yada yada, you told me already.

15:21.211 --> 15:23.005
Nearly got me killed at that bank.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.299
I thought transferring to a cell
with a passenger

15:25.382 --> 15:27.551
would be better
than getting my ass kicked every day.

15:27.635 --> 15:31.764
Turns out, it's more painful.
Stories have endings, you know.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.099
Take my first Calling.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.101
I heard, "Help him."

15:39.188 --> 15:42.524
<i>Didn't know who the hell the him</i>
<i>I was supposed to help was,</i>

15:42.608 --> 15:46.820
<i>but I did see a volunteer</i>
<i>leave a petty cash bag sitting out.</i>

15:46.904 --> 15:47.738
Hi.

15:47.821 --> 15:51.575
So, I helped myself. The end.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.663
All the Calling wanted you to do
was help someone.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.832
Why not just figure out who
and do the right thing?

16:00.334 --> 16:01.585
About a month after 9/11,

16:01.669 --> 16:04.421
there was this other immigrant kid
at school getting bullied.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.758
I already took my share of abuse
and figured,

16:07.841 --> 16:09.635
why not jump further into the fire?

16:10.135 --> 16:11.303
So I stuck up for him.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.973
Yeah? Must've felt good.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.057
It felt good

16:15.766 --> 16:17.267
for about two seconds.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.562
Then it turned into a fistfight
with the star linebacker.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.899
Golden boy got one week suspension.
But me?

16:23.983 --> 16:26.193
I got a fat lip and a full expulsion.

16:26.276 --> 16:29.363
Years of honor roll up in smoke
along with my college prospects.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.281
Lesson learned.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.702
Best to rely on me,

16:35.536 --> 16:36.745
myself…

16:41.375 --> 16:42.209
and I.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.898
You people have been asking me
the same questions for hours.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.026
I don't feel well. Please, can I go home?

17:07.109 --> 17:10.821
Look, if it's just a misunderstanding,
clear it up for me.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.489
Then we both get to go home.

17:13.282 --> 17:16.368
So, what? You got your jacket back
from Violet, you guys hit it off,

17:16.452 --> 17:17.828
you sang karaoke.

17:17.911 --> 17:18.746
So, what then?

17:18.829 --> 17:20.956
Good night? Thanks for the memories?

17:22.166 --> 17:23.167
Yeah.

17:24.626 --> 17:25.461
No, uh…

17:27.755 --> 17:28.630
We kissed.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.008
Oh yeah?

17:31.842 --> 17:32.718
How was that?

17:36.972 --> 17:38.223
It… it was…

17:42.394 --> 17:44.605
the greatest feeling I've ever had.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.784
That feeling lasted all of two hours.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.495
And then she was gone.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.001
I just wish I had walked her home.

18:06.710 --> 18:09.880
Maybe I could have done some--
done something.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.190
Radd, I need your help.

19:17.447 --> 19:19.032
So you heard the music.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.784
-You too?
-Mm.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.579
I knew it couldn't just be me.
It has to be connected, Radd.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.080
I'm glad you come.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.625
Last time our Calling helped your son.
I'm hoping we can help mine.

19:28.709 --> 19:32.212
He's been arrested by the Registry.
They think he's killing these passengers.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.881
Cal? I thought he ran off.

19:33.964 --> 19:38.302
No, he's back, and he's… older now.
It's hard to explain.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.470
I've become accustomed
to the unexplainable.

19:40.554 --> 19:43.140
Cal's been living
under an assumed identity,

19:43.223 --> 19:46.101
which is why I have to get him out
before they find out who he really is.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.519
Ever since we got Adio out,

19:47.603 --> 19:49.980
I've been working with families
for the wrongly convicted,

19:50.063 --> 19:51.398
advocating for their release.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.233
Must be why
the Callings brought us together.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.610
You can help get Cal released.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.321
Wish I could. There's little I can do
until after conviction.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.573
Then what are we missing?

20:00.282 --> 20:02.826
I mean, the Callings could've
brought us together in any other way,

20:02.910 --> 20:05.537
but we both heard the same melody
from our last Calling.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.124
No, not quite the same melody.

20:10.250 --> 20:14.296
Years ago, I turned the music
of the Calling we shared

20:14.379 --> 20:16.173
into a composition for my son.

20:16.798 --> 20:21.178
Maybe… maybe there's something in it
that can help yours.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.314
That's what you heard?

20:32.397 --> 20:35.025
That's the new section.
But you heard this?

20:39.529 --> 20:41.490
That's the start of the song.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.867
The pain of him being behind bars.

20:44.534 --> 20:48.163
I see, but…
they don't seem to go together.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.916
That's because we're missing
a part in between.

20:52.125 --> 20:56.129
The part I wrote for you.
You were the connection we needed.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.757
The bridge.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.551
The bridge. That's gotta be
what I'm supposed to find, but…

21:03.095 --> 21:03.929
why?

21:10.227 --> 21:12.145
Okay,
you gotta come check this out.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.565
I had Saanvi send me
some of the major's files,

21:15.649 --> 21:19.861
which said they had to resort
to using commercially available sapphire.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.322
-What else is there?
-Exactly.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.699
If you believe in Apocrypha,

21:23.782 --> 21:26.159
everything from
the stone of the Oracle of Delphi

21:26.243 --> 21:27.953
to the Ten Commandments,

21:28.036 --> 21:31.957
they're all said to be made from sapphire
mined from the same ancient quarry.

21:32.040 --> 21:36.086
The scholars refer to them
as Omega Sapphires.

21:36.169 --> 21:38.463
So why do you think the major wanted
an Omega Sapphire?

21:38.547 --> 21:42.217
Well, these sapphires
are thought to be supercharged.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.427
Maybe the major thought

21:43.510 --> 21:45.929
she could tap into the full power
of the Callings.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.849
You actually think there might still be
one of them out there?

21:49.516 --> 21:50.434
I don't know.

21:50.934 --> 21:54.271
But if there is, we need to find it.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.733
Gotta admit, I imagined
a slightly more professional operation.

21:57.816 --> 22:01.361
This makes me feel like I'm about to get
shot into space in a roll of toilet paper.

22:01.445 --> 22:05.115
We have everything we need.
What we don't have is time. Sit.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.704
The only reason I agreed
to allow you in my building

22:10.787 --> 22:14.708
is Saanvi assured me
the process would be extremely painful.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.461
You allowed me in
because a passenger's life is in danger,

22:17.544 --> 22:19.171
and I'm the only one who can help.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.173
So let's save the ball-buster act.

22:21.256 --> 22:23.925
After you drop the good Samaritan routine.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.887
We both know you don't care
about anyone but yourself.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.014
Did you think I was serious?

22:29.890 --> 22:33.643
Adrian's super dead by now.
The passenger I'm trying to save is me.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.613
Lie back, please.

22:50.077 --> 22:53.080
You said you wouldn't go past
using a 40% electric charge, right?

22:53.163 --> 22:56.833
The major achieved some degree of clarity
with her subjects at 50%,

22:56.917 --> 22:58.835
but that's where
the risk becomes too great.

22:58.919 --> 23:03.173
So we're hoping with you as our subject,
we can get more clarity for less power.

23:04.633 --> 23:05.467
Eagan?

23:06.468 --> 23:08.387
Hey, Eagan, you with me?

23:08.470 --> 23:10.931
Yeah, yeah, clarity, power, copy.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.822
There's something we're missing.

23:36.832 --> 23:40.877
Okay. Can you play the bridge again
but slower, and just the melody?

23:40.961 --> 23:42.087
Yes. Yes.

23:54.808 --> 23:57.352
Okay. I count ten notes.

23:59.604 --> 24:02.357
And musical notes correspond to numbers,
don't they?

24:03.942 --> 24:05.193
That's right.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.696
This song is written
in the key of E minor,

24:07.779 --> 24:11.324
so E is one and so on, so…

24:12.200 --> 24:13.493
Two, one.

24:14.411 --> 24:15.662
Five…

24:32.429 --> 24:34.347
The numbers. They're

24:35.307 --> 24:36.433
glowing.

24:36.516 --> 24:39.436
That's ten digits, beginning with 212.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.731
That's a… that's a New York phone number.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.862
Deep breath.

24:51.573 --> 24:52.574
Calm your mind.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.412
Focus on the Calling you had last night.

24:59.456 --> 25:00.707
Picture the faucet.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.419
Picture the black mold.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.255
Find where the hallway leads.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.799
Find where Adrian is being kept.

25:12.093 --> 25:13.970
How will we know it's working?

25:14.054 --> 25:16.431
If he gets a Calling,
it'll flash bright white

25:16.515 --> 25:18.099
and his memory center will light up.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.074
35%.

25:34.783 --> 25:38.119
Pulse rising fast. 152. 177.

25:41.581 --> 25:42.499
40%.

25:44.584 --> 25:47.879
I saw the flash! There's a faint glow
coming from the memory center.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.010
No, we have to stop. Eagan?

25:54.094 --> 25:56.429
-Eagan? Eagan? Hey, Eagan.

25:56.513 --> 25:57.764
Hey, you okay?

25:58.723 --> 25:59.599
You okay?

26:00.725 --> 26:02.978
Did it, um… did it work?

26:04.813 --> 26:07.774
If you're trying to weaponize migraines,
then, yeah, it worked.

26:07.857 --> 26:10.110
Your brain scan lit up.
Are you sure didn't see anything?

26:10.193 --> 26:12.779
Just a few seconds of bright light.
Nothing to write home about.

26:13.738 --> 26:14.739
Are you sure?

26:16.074 --> 26:19.911
Why would I lie? I don't wanna be
serial killed any more than you do.

26:19.995 --> 26:23.164
You stopped where the major began
to see results. You had no choice.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.833
Even if it means finding a killer?

26:24.916 --> 26:26.251
No. No.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.129
I will not sacrifice a life
to save another.

26:29.212 --> 26:31.923
If there is a god
at the other end of this frequency,

26:32.007 --> 26:34.301
this can't be how she wants
to communicate with us.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.812
<i>Oncology, Dr. Bates.</i>

26:47.981 --> 26:49.107
<i>Oncology.</i>

26:50.108 --> 26:52.986
Is… is that Dr. Alex Bates?

26:53.737 --> 26:55.488
Yes. Can I help you?

26:58.658 --> 27:00.619
My name is Ben Stone. Is my…

27:02.120 --> 27:05.457
Is Gabriel Stone… your patient?

27:07.083 --> 27:09.628
<i>Dr. Bates, I know all about HIPAA.</i>

27:10.170 --> 27:11.713
Now, I've been led to you for a reason.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.965
I know Saanvi trusts you
more than anyone in the world,

27:14.049 --> 27:15.967
<i>and I trust Saanvi, so please.</i>

27:17.344 --> 27:18.511
My son, is…

27:22.223 --> 27:23.516
is he sick again?

27:27.187 --> 27:28.021
Uh…

27:28.104 --> 27:29.731
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

27:30.315 --> 27:32.901
This isn't how anyone should receive news.

27:34.361 --> 27:35.487
Ben, if he's sick,

27:35.570 --> 27:38.657
I can argue that the Registry doesn't have
the resources to care for him.

27:38.740 --> 27:41.493
<i>Then the Registry will have</i>
<i>to release him to his doctor,</i>

27:41.576 --> 27:43.703
<i>hopefully before they take his DNA.</i>

27:46.581 --> 27:49.376
Mr. Stone, meet me at the Registry.

27:49.959 --> 27:51.628
I'll do anything I can to help.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.506
Yeah. Thank you.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.429
We're running out of time.
We just gotta choose some locations,

28:01.513 --> 28:04.599
work our way down the list,
and hope we get lucky.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.561
Wait, hold on. Something's off.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.814
This place on 165th.

28:11.731 --> 28:14.275
The box is here,
but it's not on the active job list.

28:16.403 --> 28:19.698
That place got shut down by the city,
but it should still be on the list.

28:19.781 --> 28:22.784
It's not. Someone must have wanted it
off the books after the transfer.

28:22.867 --> 28:24.119
Why was the site shut down?

28:24.202 --> 28:27.747
Water main burst.
Black mold everywhere. Nasty stuff.

28:29.582 --> 28:30.542
Black mold.

28:31.292 --> 28:32.752
It's like Eagan's Calling.

28:33.253 --> 28:34.087
<i>Vance here.</i>

28:34.170 --> 28:36.548
Hey, Jared's gonna text you an address.
Meet us there, okay?

28:46.057 --> 28:48.935
Okay, so I tracked down
all of the Omega Sapphires

28:49.018 --> 28:51.730
that I could find,
and the Oracle of Delphi did use one,

28:51.813 --> 28:53.064
but it disappeared off of the--

28:54.399 --> 28:56.818
Ground Control to Major Tom.

28:58.862 --> 29:00.071
What's up with you?

29:00.572 --> 29:02.407
I'm fine. Just a little tired.

29:02.490 --> 29:03.324
Oh.

29:05.702 --> 29:09.456
Okay. Well, first, um…

29:11.124 --> 29:16.546
you're a really bad liar for an empath,
which is ironic.

29:17.130 --> 29:22.677
Um, second, you've been off
for a couple days now.

29:23.970 --> 29:24.971
Spill.

29:27.348 --> 29:28.391
I messed up.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.771
Fell off the wagon about two days ago.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.315
I'm back at it.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.108
Went to a meeting.

29:38.818 --> 29:40.737
But I still gotta tell Mick.

29:44.657 --> 29:48.828
Well, when I was in a really tough place

29:48.912 --> 29:53.041
and felt completely trapped on the inside,

29:55.084 --> 29:56.419
you freed me.

29:59.339 --> 30:01.883
And I know I can't do the same for you,

30:01.966 --> 30:04.636
but I believe in you.

30:06.596 --> 30:07.972
And Mick will too.

30:09.933 --> 30:10.975
She loves you.

30:15.396 --> 30:16.356
Thanks.

30:17.398 --> 30:18.358
I needed that.

30:35.291 --> 30:36.417
What are you doing?

30:38.253 --> 30:42.048
You led the Stones right to me.
Let them steal my guardian angel.

30:42.131 --> 30:45.885
I don't know what my mother plans to do
to you, but you deserve whatever's coming.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.053
Angelina!

30:47.136 --> 30:50.390
Don't let me die here!
You can still make things right!

30:55.061 --> 30:56.062
Angelina!

31:01.901 --> 31:04.028
Angelina!

31:06.489 --> 31:09.826
Please tell me you found something helpful
in the major's research.

31:09.909 --> 31:13.246
<i>I literally just now</i>
<i>found this on Reddit. Ready?</i>

31:13.329 --> 31:15.915
Okay, it looks like there were
seven powerful stones

31:15.999 --> 31:17.500
called Omega Sapphires.

31:17.584 --> 31:19.210
Most were lost to history,

31:19.294 --> 31:23.506
but I just stumbled onto a lead
to the last remaining one.

31:24.507 --> 31:25.550
Amazing.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.302
Where is it?

31:27.385 --> 31:31.848
In a place called Ağri Daği in 2013.

31:33.391 --> 31:36.102
Ağri Daği is what the Turkish
renamed Mount Ararat.

31:36.185 --> 31:40.315
That's where they found
the fragment of Noah's Ark

31:40.398 --> 31:41.524
that we had at Eureka.

31:41.608 --> 31:43.067
It was imbued with sapphire,

31:44.402 --> 31:46.446
and I tossed it into the fissure.

31:48.281 --> 31:52.577
I literally threw away my only shot
at generating a Calling.

31:52.660 --> 31:53.828
<i>I have to go.</i>

31:57.373 --> 31:58.249
You knew.

31:58.333 --> 32:02.128
Even if it doesn't feel like it now,
you did the right thing.

32:02.211 --> 32:03.546
But it doesn't make any sense.

32:03.630 --> 32:06.674
If what I did was right,
then what we are doing now is wrong.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.635
God can be a dangerous role to play.

32:08.718 --> 32:11.512
But your grandmother,
the dragon constellation.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.348
I mean, you said so yourself,

32:13.431 --> 32:15.808
"Faith has a seat at the table after all."

32:16.643 --> 32:19.228
And perhaps someday we'll understand how.

32:30.323 --> 32:31.866
I don't know about you,

32:32.450 --> 32:36.204
but failing to find a serial killer
through experimental science

32:36.704 --> 32:38.164
always makes me

32:39.666 --> 32:40.625
thirsty.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.505
This wasn't just about
fighting Noelle, was it?

32:47.423 --> 32:52.345
I was hoping it was gonna be the beginning
of a conversation with the divine.

32:53.721 --> 32:55.390
But I think that's impossible now.

32:55.473 --> 32:58.309
I thought you science types
didn't believe in the impossible.

32:58.393 --> 32:59.686
Well, I do now.

33:01.270 --> 33:05.358
Turns out, I need some
specific kind of sapphire called Omega,

33:05.441 --> 33:08.528
and it's been lost forever or destroyed.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.085
You never know, Saanvi.

33:25.336 --> 33:29.048
Sometimes life's failures lead you
to exactly where you need to be.

33:34.512 --> 33:37.807
I'm gonna take a quick sample
of your blood for DNA testing.

33:41.185 --> 33:44.397
Gabriel Stone is at a critical point
in his cancer treatment.

33:44.480 --> 33:47.150
He should be getting systemic treatment
as we speak.

33:47.233 --> 33:48.985
Unless you have
the proper facilities here,

33:49.068 --> 33:51.696
you need to release Gabriel
into the custody of his physician.

33:51.779 --> 33:53.573
Come on. This is her. Dr. Alex Bates.

34:05.501 --> 34:06.586
Hey, hold up.

34:25.480 --> 34:28.357
Angelina should've been here
to bear witness to your atonement,

34:28.441 --> 34:29.817
but God had other plans.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.654
Defend us in the hour of our conflict.

34:33.738 --> 34:37.325
Be our safeguard against the wickedness
and snares of the devil.

34:37.408 --> 34:38.868
No, you're… you're forgetting.

34:39.535 --> 34:44.999
"Somehow faith, hope, and love abide."

34:46.000 --> 34:47.210
"These three."

34:47.293 --> 34:49.420
"But the greatest of these is love."

34:50.421 --> 34:52.507
Quoting Corinthians doesn't make you holy.

34:52.590 --> 34:53.966
"God will judge you."

34:55.009 --> 34:59.889
"For judgment is without mercy
to one who's shown no mercy."

35:01.808 --> 35:04.143
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

35:19.826 --> 35:20.785
Please!

35:21.744 --> 35:22.578
That's Adrian.

35:22.662 --> 35:23.913
Save me!

35:27.959 --> 35:29.418
Sh.

35:32.547 --> 35:33.840
Help!

35:34.757 --> 35:35.842
Help!

35:38.511 --> 35:40.805
This was not my role to play,
but when called upon,

35:40.888 --> 35:42.598
I will show my devotion

35:42.682 --> 35:45.268
and eliminate all the tempters
from my daughter's path

35:45.351 --> 35:48.146
so she can be returned to salvation!

35:52.066 --> 35:53.860
-Stop!
-Noelle, stop!

35:53.943 --> 35:55.486
Drop the knife, now!

35:58.865 --> 36:01.492
Adrian, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

36:04.871 --> 36:06.205
911, unresponsive.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.165
I got it.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.551
Hey. We got Noelle.

36:19.051 --> 36:20.052
Adrian's alive.

36:20.887 --> 36:23.181
That's good,
but it doesn't look like she's the killer.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.766
We just stopped her from drowning Adrian.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.603
Well, I just got camera stills of Noelle
driving through the toll booth

36:28.686 --> 36:31.063
on the GW Bridge
during the time of Violet's murder.

36:31.147 --> 36:33.649
She might be working with the killer,
but she didn't kill Violet.

36:52.126 --> 36:53.544
Why didn't you tell me?

36:54.212 --> 36:56.297
You have enough to worry about.

36:58.966 --> 37:00.259
You are my son.

37:01.510 --> 37:02.803
And you will always be my son,

37:02.887 --> 37:05.306
even when I'm not being the father
that I should.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.391
-It's okay, Dad.
-No, it's not.

37:08.392 --> 37:10.895
I'll never be able to make up
for how I treated you.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.230
You don't have to.

37:13.356 --> 37:16.359
Whatever happens,
we'll get through it together.

37:19.445 --> 37:20.279
Cal.

37:30.498 --> 37:34.210
When the snow began to fall
and the waters froze over,

37:35.670 --> 37:38.464
Brown Bear went back into the cave.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.284
-Olive!

38:07.076 --> 38:09.036
The killer's still out there.
I'm worried they're--

38:09.120 --> 38:10.162
They're already here.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.583
Olive! Check the doors.

38:14.667 --> 38:17.962
I think someone is trying to break in.
See if the cop is still out front!

38:18.045 --> 38:19.839
Uncle Zeke, I'm scared.

38:29.181 --> 38:32.143
Everything's okay.
We just gotta be quiet for a little while.

38:32.226 --> 38:35.354
Can you help me do that?
All right, sweetheart. Lay down.

38:35.438 --> 38:36.564
Sh. Okay.

38:44.405 --> 38:45.406
It's okay, miss!

38:51.787 --> 38:54.915
I'm sorry if I scared you, miss.
Is everything okay in here?

38:54.999 --> 38:58.419
No, there's…
I think there may be an intruder.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.046
Stay behind me.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.690
No! That's Zeke! That's Zeke.

39:20.566 --> 39:21.567
He lives here.

39:26.113 --> 39:27.239
Noelle!

39:30.159 --> 39:33.412
That's not a cop, Olive.
That's Angelina's dad.

39:33.496 --> 39:36.207
Officer Chaudhry's
just taking a little nap

39:36.290 --> 39:38.876
in the trunk of his car
while I get what I came for.

39:40.586 --> 39:42.421
I understand how you feel, Kenneth.

39:43.130 --> 39:45.800
You're angry.
You just wanna help Angelina.

39:46.550 --> 39:49.970
She needs to see with her own eyes
that child is no angel.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.098
It does not have God's protection.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.141
I can help you.

39:55.559 --> 39:56.560
Olive, run!

40:13.285 --> 40:15.371
No one else needs to get hurt!

40:15.454 --> 40:17.915
-I just need the demon child.

40:44.650 --> 40:45.818
Go to hell!

41:04.128 --> 41:05.463
Oh my God! What the--

41:05.546 --> 41:08.299
Hey, it's fine.
Angelina's father came for Eden.

41:08.382 --> 41:10.342
-Kenneth.
-Olive sent him out the window.

41:11.760 --> 41:12.803
Damn.

41:13.971 --> 41:16.223
This does not look good.
Are you sure you're okay?

41:16.307 --> 41:18.559
Bullet went clean through.
Just a quick patch job.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.186
I can come home later tonight.

41:21.979 --> 41:24.064
-I'll meet you at the hospital, okay?
-Okay.

41:32.781 --> 41:33.991
You did the right thing.

41:37.077 --> 41:37.953
I know.

41:54.053 --> 41:56.305
Just released your buddy from custody.

41:56.972 --> 41:59.975
Dropping all charges.
How'd you crack the case?

42:00.059 --> 42:02.728
One of your special friends
get one of their special feelings?

42:02.811 --> 42:04.980
No, just good old-fashioned police work.

42:05.731 --> 42:07.858
You know, the passengers,
they're just normal people

42:07.942 --> 42:10.736
who came back to a very abnormal world.

42:11.237 --> 42:13.531
You just gotta understand that world
to police it.

42:15.991 --> 42:18.202
-I guess you're still calling my boss?
-Damn straight.

42:19.745 --> 42:22.164
Calling to request a transfer to 828.

42:22.665 --> 42:24.250
Your talents are wasted on patrol.

42:24.917 --> 42:27.878
And the Registry could use
another good detective.

43:59.678 --> 44:01.930
<i>-Hey, it's TJ. Leave a message.</i>

44:02.014 --> 44:04.183
-Where are you?

44:05.684 --> 44:06.560
I…

44:07.186 --> 44:10.064
I've been texting, and, um…

44:12.816 --> 44:15.486
today was a really rough day.

44:18.155 --> 44:20.824
So it'd be nice to hear your voice.

44:38.217 --> 44:39.051
TJ?

44:40.803 --> 44:41.637
TJ!

44:44.556 --> 44:47.393
What are you doing here?
I… I can't believe you're here.

44:47.476 --> 44:49.520
I just got off a flight,
and I got your messages.

44:49.603 --> 44:51.897
I've been looking
for the same thing in Egypt.

44:52.690 --> 44:54.024
Omega Sapphire?

44:54.108 --> 44:56.443
But I think it might be right here
in New York.

44:56.527 --> 44:57.486
Wow.

44:58.487 --> 44:59.863
It is really all connected.

45:00.656 --> 45:02.157
I only got two questions for you.

45:03.117 --> 45:04.952
Do you wanna go
on a sapphire hunt with me?

45:06.912 --> 45:08.122
And can I kiss you?

45:20.884 --> 45:22.761
I'd like to volunteer.

45:23.762 --> 45:25.139
You've been here before, right?

45:25.931 --> 45:26.890
It's been a while.

45:27.516 --> 45:29.893
Feels like it's time
to balance out my karma.

45:37.067 --> 45:40.612
Ready or not, Omega Sapphire. Here I come.
