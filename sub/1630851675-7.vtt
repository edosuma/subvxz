00:03.621 --> 00:05.904
This little human is
meant to be in my family.

00:05.940 --> 00:07.606
- Okay, so, how are you,
like, navigating all this?

00:07.658 --> 00:10.826
- I'm doing okay.

00:10.861 --> 00:12.578
- Oh, my god.

00:12.613 --> 00:16.265
- I want us to go on a trip
in williamsburg

00:16.300 --> 00:17.833
hosted by yours truly.

00:17.868 --> 00:18.734
[cheering]

00:18.769 --> 00:20.669
- mia, you need to
demonstrate for us.

00:20.705 --> 00:22.738
- Girl, I don't know
what to do on a pole.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.006
You ready?

00:24.041 --> 00:28.093
[screaming]

00:28.129 --> 00:29.878
- yeah, you was a stripper.

00:29.913 --> 00:32.715
- Candiace invited the ladies
to go to williamsburg.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.968
I think maybe just a day
I'll go down.

00:36.020 --> 00:40.322
[cheering]

00:40.357 --> 00:42.858
- new booty wendy
is here to stay, honey,

00:42.893 --> 00:44.777
and new titties, too.

00:44.812 --> 00:48.330
Leather together.
- Yes.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.150
- Anybody who is makin'
these kinda changes,

00:51.202 --> 00:52.234
somethin' is off.
- Something is-- yeah.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.403
- To be honest, there are
some cheating allegations

00:54.438 --> 00:55.637
with her husband.

00:58.292 --> 01:02.144
I've seen more of your
body parts in the past month

01:02.179 --> 01:05.414
than I have the entire time
I've known you.

01:05.449 --> 01:06.915
- Since you've been
asking everybody questions--

01:06.951 --> 01:08.117
- yes, yes.

01:08.152 --> 01:09.501
- Are you in a relationship?

01:09.553 --> 01:14.590
- I'm not gonna discuss that
in front of trolls.

01:16.527 --> 01:18.393
- The secret
to this pretty face

01:18.429 --> 01:21.029
is stayin' in the shade.

01:21.065 --> 01:22.765
- If you wanna pop off,

01:22.800 --> 01:25.734
I'll be happy
to get you adjusted.

01:25.770 --> 01:30.172
- I may keep you waiting,
but trust me, I'm worth it.

01:30.207 --> 01:34.610
- The only thing messier
than two boys is me.

01:34.645 --> 01:39.181
- My blessings are many,
and my patience is none.

01:39.216 --> 01:42.184
- This professor doesn't
just grade on the curve.

01:42.219 --> 01:44.169
She sets the curve.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.555
- The grand dame can never
be duplicated,

01:46.590 --> 01:49.758
imitated,
or intimidated.

01:51.595 --> 01:57.716
♪♪

01:57.768 --> 01:58.517
- okay.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.334
- I don't know
how to drive this.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.686
- It says stop,
and park, and go.

02:00.721 --> 02:01.553
That's all we need to know.

02:01.605 --> 02:02.171
- So, how do you reverse?
- That's it.

02:02.206 --> 02:03.772
Oh, I forgot that.

02:03.808 --> 02:05.173
- I want y'all to try that out
before I get in.

02:05.192 --> 02:06.141
[laughing]

02:06.176 --> 02:08.360
- do you those pancakes
have crispy edges?

02:08.395 --> 02:09.511
- I can give you
crispy edges.

02:09.530 --> 02:12.147
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:12.182 --> 02:14.066
- Hi, poopski.
- Good morning.

02:14.118 --> 02:15.584
How'd you sleep,
buttercup?

02:15.619 --> 02:19.588
- Um, I-I did not
go to sleep immediately.

02:19.623 --> 02:21.690
- Okay.
I heard some rumbles.

02:21.725 --> 02:22.541
- Yeah.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.593
I got choreography
for my music video

02:24.628 --> 02:25.577
from my choreographer.
- Okay.

02:25.629 --> 02:27.412
- So, I was just
looking at it.

02:27.464 --> 02:28.380
- Nice. I love it.
- Yeah.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.799
- Miss gizelle,
this plate is pretty warm.

02:30.835 --> 02:32.167
- Yes.
- So, just be careful, okay?

02:32.202 --> 02:34.720
- Okay.
- Good morning, ladies!

02:34.755 --> 02:36.405
- Good morn-ting.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.706
- Hi, baby.
Kisses for you.

02:37.725 --> 02:38.974
I didn't get to say
good morning to you.

02:39.009 --> 02:40.225
- Good morning.
Muah.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.244
This is so triflin'.
We are eating.

02:42.279 --> 02:44.112
- No, it's not.
- And they are not here.

02:44.148 --> 02:47.099
- Okay, hi.
- Muah.

02:47.151 --> 02:48.233
- You look so cute.
- Hi.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.451
- Thank you.
You all look beautiful.

02:49.486 --> 02:50.452
Muah.
- Muah.

02:50.487 --> 02:52.120
- Like a god-tis.
- Yes.

02:52.156 --> 02:53.055
- Aww, thank you.
Muah.

02:53.090 --> 02:53.956
[phone ringing]
- put on here and there

02:53.991 --> 02:56.258
and see if that works,
on stop and go.

02:56.293 --> 02:58.110
- Hello.
Hey, girl,

02:58.162 --> 03:01.263
we're trying to figure out
this golf cart situation.

03:01.298 --> 03:03.749
- Breakfast is ready,
and it's hot.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.067
So...

03:07.204 --> 03:11.039
- Like a hooker, karen!

03:11.074 --> 03:13.208
- Do you need a ride?

03:13.244 --> 03:14.710
- What you guys
been talkin' about?

03:14.745 --> 03:15.794
- When I got up this morning
'cause, you know,

03:15.846 --> 03:17.913
I got up kinda early.
- Of course.

03:17.932 --> 03:19.281
- I saw mia.

03:19.316 --> 03:21.984
She said that karen
was so sad last night

03:22.019 --> 03:22.851
when she went to bed

03:22.887 --> 03:25.020
because gizelle
called her a troll.

03:25.055 --> 03:26.972
- I texted her.
She's hurt.

03:27.024 --> 03:28.473
- Good.
I'm glad.

03:28.525 --> 03:29.424
- Well, she said
she didn't sleep well.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.860
- Karen, shut the (bleep) up.
[laughing]

03:31.896 --> 03:33.979
- you would be upset if someone
called you a troll, too.

03:34.031 --> 03:35.781
- But if I'm not, then...

03:35.816 --> 03:38.867
- Yeah, screw karen
up the butt, okay?

03:38.903 --> 03:40.535
- Stop, stop.

03:40.571 --> 03:41.637
- Oh, they're here.
Shh. Quiet.

03:41.672 --> 03:42.955
- Oh, stop talking
about them.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.206
They're here.
- Shh.

03:44.241 --> 03:45.274
[laughing]

03:45.309 --> 03:47.292
- stop it.
- Okay, wen-day.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.493
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello.

03:48.545 --> 03:50.245
- Okay, wen-day.
- How are you?

03:50.281 --> 03:52.481
- This how we do it
in the cottage.

03:52.516 --> 03:54.800
It's okay.
[laughing]

03:54.835 --> 03:56.285
- karen is right.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.687
I can change my body
because I want to.

03:58.722 --> 04:00.555
- You're a little more
conservative today.

04:00.591 --> 04:02.324
Why?
You're going to a pool.

04:02.359 --> 04:06.094
If you're dressing for her,
go change your ----ing clothes.

04:06.129 --> 04:08.013
- I need to
set my boundaries.

04:08.065 --> 04:12.234
I refuse to let anyone tell me
what or what not to look like

04:12.269 --> 04:14.102
because I'm a grown woman.

04:14.137 --> 04:17.322
- So, how did everyone
sleep across the way?

04:17.358 --> 04:18.190
- Good.
- Good.

04:18.242 --> 04:19.324
- Good?
- The beds are really comfy.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.325
- Super comfy.
- Good.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.827
Yeah, they are.
- The company was excellent.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.780
- Aww.

04:24.815 --> 04:27.332
These pancakes
were amazing, chef.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.817
- Thank you.
- Oh, yes.

04:28.852 --> 04:29.851
- Are you ready?
You wanna bring your plate?

04:29.887 --> 04:30.886
- Give me two seconds.
- Okay.

04:30.921 --> 04:31.703
- Where are you guys going?
Everything okay?

04:31.755 --> 04:32.921
- Oh, everything is great.
- Okay.

04:32.957 --> 04:35.891
- Yeah.

04:35.926 --> 04:36.692
- Where to?

04:36.727 --> 04:37.793
- I think we
should go upstairs.

04:37.828 --> 04:41.930
- What them hos doin'?
Why they gotta go upstairs?

04:41.966 --> 04:43.899
Gizelle and robyn
are having a secret meeting.

04:43.934 --> 04:46.368
- Maybe they're talking about
how to run their aerobics.

04:46.403 --> 04:50.005
- No.
Oh, dear, so naive.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.306
[laughing]

04:51.341 --> 04:52.691
- so naive you are.
[sighs]

04:52.726 --> 04:53.775
- look at the water
and everything.

04:53.811 --> 04:55.360
- It's just nice to be out.
Yes.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.579
What body of water is this?
- I don't know.

04:57.614 --> 04:59.381
Is this the chesapeake?

04:59.416 --> 05:02.868
- Uh-uh. No.
[laughing]

05:02.903 --> 05:04.186
- I'm gonna
be transparent with you.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.186
- Yes.

05:05.205 --> 05:07.589
- And I did express concern.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

05:07.624 --> 05:09.391
- Um, about the comments
that were made

05:09.426 --> 05:10.242
towards your marriage.

05:10.294 --> 05:11.243
- Do you think
him being the manager

05:11.295 --> 05:13.595
is holding him back from
getting his hustle on?

05:13.630 --> 05:15.597
- I'm thinking
that's on her coattails.

05:15.632 --> 05:17.716
Now, by the way,
what is he doing?

05:17.751 --> 05:20.135
- The online cooking,
teaching courses.

05:20.170 --> 05:22.871
- Nice.
- He plays golf.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.223
- I found that disrespectful.
- Um...

05:25.259 --> 05:26.374
- Some-- go ahead.

05:26.393 --> 05:33.015
- I-I have come to learn that
gizelle is not capable

05:33.050 --> 05:35.267
of couth 24 hours a day.
She's not emotional.

05:35.319 --> 05:37.753
- Typically, when people
start doing this--
- yeah.

05:37.788 --> 05:39.955
- It's because somethin'
is not right here.

05:39.990 --> 05:41.406
- You're-- you're hitting
the nail on the head.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.408
- Yeah.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.943
- Okay, but there's no way

05:44.995 --> 05:46.611
that I would want to have
this discussion with you

05:46.663 --> 05:48.747
in front of the group.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.033
I love you.
I think you're amazing.

05:51.068 --> 05:52.667
Um, I know your story.

05:52.703 --> 05:54.569
I know the struggles,
all of that,

05:54.588 --> 05:55.570
and then I see
where you are now.

05:55.589 --> 05:56.671
You're winning.

05:56.707 --> 05:58.040
So, I'm like,
okay, well, does--

05:58.075 --> 05:58.924
does robyn not see that?

05:58.959 --> 06:01.109
- I've been, like,
unmotivated, lately.

06:01.145 --> 06:03.879
It's, like,
affecting my relationship

06:03.914 --> 06:05.814
because juan is like,
"that's not attractive."

06:05.849 --> 06:06.848
- what?

06:06.884 --> 06:10.252
- I-I am winning,
and I thank god every day, uh,

06:10.287 --> 06:11.820
for my blessings,

06:11.855 --> 06:18.810
but I don't see
what people see in me.

06:18.862 --> 06:21.897
Do I have dreams
of being a mogul? Yes.

06:21.932 --> 06:23.865
I don't know that
I can picture that.

06:23.901 --> 06:26.134
- But-but, robyn,
you second guessing yourself

06:26.170 --> 06:28.403
does not make you
get back in the bed at noon.

06:28.438 --> 06:29.738
Have you looked at
your bank account?

06:29.773 --> 06:31.873
Like, that should
push you through.

06:31.909 --> 06:35.077
You cannot have
your fine husband--

06:35.112 --> 06:36.445
- yes, telling me
it's unattractive.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.980
- Telling you
you're unattractive, sis.

06:39.016 --> 06:42.450
- I know.
- That doesn't motivate you?

06:42.469 --> 06:43.718
I'm giving robyn tough love

06:43.754 --> 06:45.787
because, a,
I know she can handle it.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.974
B, if I don't,
then I'm not being a friend.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.927
I wanna see robyn win.
Period.

06:51.962 --> 06:55.363
- The thought of being
what I can be--

06:55.399 --> 06:58.817
- yeah.
- Is kinda scary.

06:58.869 --> 07:01.486
- What are you scared of?

07:01.538 --> 07:05.740
- Maybe getting to a point
and then falling even harder.

07:05.775 --> 07:07.242
- You're-you're not
that girl anymore.

07:07.277 --> 07:08.376
- Right.

07:08.412 --> 07:10.495
- You're not going
back to that.

07:10.547 --> 07:12.464
- Juan and I had
a best friend.

07:12.499 --> 07:14.166
He was taking our money
and lying.

07:14.218 --> 07:18.503
By the time we caught onto it,
our money was gone.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.155
I'll never forget
that time in my life.

07:20.174 --> 07:23.875
It may, in a way,
have created, like, ptsd

07:23.927 --> 07:26.895
because I was literally
signing up to do, like,

07:26.930 --> 07:31.850
every focus group I could to
just make $100 to buy groceries

07:31.885 --> 07:34.536
and just waiting to pull up
to the house

07:34.571 --> 07:37.672
and see my house
is being foreclosed.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.524
My kids never knew
that things were bad.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.193
I think, if we were to
go through that now,

07:41.228 --> 07:45.847
they would be probably
very affected by it.

07:45.866 --> 07:46.948
- How is robyn gonna get better
and get out of this funk

07:46.984 --> 07:49.234
'cause I want robyn to be
the best robyn she can be?

07:49.286 --> 07:52.537
- I probably need to get help
as far as my business.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.872
- All you should be
doing right now,

07:53.907 --> 07:55.457
as the president
of your company,

07:55.492 --> 07:57.826
is building your brand,
getting into department stores.

07:57.861 --> 08:00.462
- I know, and I have retailers
reaching out to me.

08:00.497 --> 08:02.497
I-I just--
I don't go for it.

08:02.533 --> 08:04.499
- Give me an example.
- Macy's.

08:04.534 --> 08:07.335
- What?
- Tj maxx, qvc.

08:07.370 --> 08:08.553
- What?

08:08.589 --> 08:10.722
Robyn, what are
you talking about?

08:10.757 --> 08:11.723
- Reaching out to me.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.508
- They want to
sell your product, your hats.

08:13.544 --> 08:15.093
- Yes.
- And what are you saying?

08:15.145 --> 08:17.279
- Nothing.
That's why I need help.

08:17.314 --> 08:20.565
- Just I wanna strangle you.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.933
- Coming up next...

08:21.985 --> 08:24.553
- I see you for everything
everybody ever said

08:24.588 --> 08:25.654
that you were.

08:25.689 --> 08:28.273
The life you're livin' now,
is god paying you back

08:28.325 --> 08:30.108
for all the bullsh--.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.359
That's real sh--.

08:31.395 --> 08:33.828
♪♪

08:33.963 --> 08:42.304
♪♪

08:42.339 --> 08:44.172
time to get
the party started!

08:44.208 --> 08:45.907
- Okay, okay!

08:45.943 --> 08:47.342
- But I'm not swimming.

08:47.377 --> 08:49.143
- You got a new booty
to show the people.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.479
- Not in the pool!

08:51.515 --> 08:56.167
- I have incorporated into
my exercise routine swimming.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.586
Oh, the water feels great.

08:57.621 --> 09:00.755
So, I'm in a pool
three times a week,

09:00.791 --> 09:04.009
and I know how to
make my body better,

09:04.044 --> 09:06.294
all of this,
by my swimming.

09:06.329 --> 09:08.013
Bitches, y'all
need help, okay?

09:08.048 --> 09:10.298
So, get in the pool and
let me show you what to do.

09:10.333 --> 09:11.182
Who?
- You.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.133
- You're messing up
the photo op.

09:12.169 --> 09:13.134
- What?

09:13.170 --> 09:14.335
- The instructor
needs to move.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.971
- Hide in here.
Hide over here.

09:16.006 --> 09:17.472
[laughing]

09:17.507 --> 09:19.190
- y'all are being
sticks in the mud!

09:19.226 --> 09:20.141
- You gettin' in?

09:20.177 --> 09:20.642
- Are you ready
for water aerobics?

09:20.677 --> 09:21.743
- Oh, no.
- No?

09:21.778 --> 09:23.211
- Remember this has to--
- so, you're not getting in?

09:23.247 --> 09:24.479
- I'm-- I'm here to cheer.

09:24.514 --> 09:25.513
First of all,
I'm not puttin' myself

09:25.532 --> 09:26.364
in the water with gizelle.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.149
I don't trust my life
in her hands.

09:28.184 --> 09:30.068
Not happening.
I'm being sworn in.

09:30.120 --> 09:33.455
This lace cannot come up,
so we're not gonna test it.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.856
- All right.
I'll come in.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.591
- Really?
- Why not?

09:36.627 --> 09:38.877
- Holler, the swim cap gang.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.463
- How do you guys
put this thing on?

09:41.498 --> 09:43.632
- She's trying to say we got
some big-ass heads.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.667
- That looks like
a big-ass condom.

09:45.702 --> 09:47.836
Whose dick is
fittin' in that?

09:47.871 --> 09:49.738
- Wendy!

09:49.773 --> 09:53.241
- Class is in session!
- Yes, ladies.

09:53.277 --> 09:55.727
- Okay, so, everybody needs to
back up.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.445
This is the first move
that we're gonna make.

09:57.481 --> 09:58.246
Are y'all ready?
- Yes.

09:58.282 --> 10:01.215
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.417
- Oh, candiace's booty
is everything.

10:02.452 --> 10:03.384
- Look at the booty.

10:03.403 --> 10:06.254
- Go, candiace!
- Okay.

10:06.290 --> 10:08.256
- I've done a lotta things
in my life,

10:08.292 --> 10:10.692
but swimming is not
my forte.

10:12.696 --> 10:15.664
And because I have
happy and ness,

10:15.699 --> 10:19.901
I have inflatables,
so I can't drown.

10:19.936 --> 10:20.669
- Wen-day, come on!

10:20.704 --> 10:22.070
- Wait, okay.
Okay, here we go.

10:22.105 --> 10:22.871
Okay.
- You got it, girl.

10:22.906 --> 10:24.039
- Okay, here we go.
Oh, my gosh.

10:24.074 --> 10:26.274
Ahh!
[laughing]

10:26.310 --> 10:27.676
- wendy!

10:27.711 --> 10:29.811
Wendy, that was
a mess, okay?

10:32.082 --> 10:34.716
[laughing]

10:34.751 --> 10:36.751
- you're making it harder.
- What are you doing?

10:36.787 --> 10:43.458

10:43.493 --> 10:46.795

- Yes.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.866
- This is a house?
It look like a damn hotel.

10:51.902 --> 10:52.934
This is beautiful.

10:52.969 --> 10:54.803
- And we twerk it, twerk it,
twerk it, twerk it.

10:54.838 --> 10:55.870
- And twerk it.
And twerk it.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.305
And twerk it.
- And big circles.

10:57.341 --> 11:00.108
- Yes.

11:00.143 --> 11:01.459
- What is on
everybody's head?

11:01.495 --> 11:02.944
What is happening here?

twerk it, twerk it.
- Hello, everybody!

11:07.334 --> 11:10.284
- Hi!
- Hi, everybody!

11:10.303 --> 11:12.220
You guys look so good.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.621
What's on your heads?

11:13.640 --> 11:16.624
- Condoms.
[laughing]

11:16.660 --> 11:17.926
- do you have your, um,
swimsuit?

11:17.961 --> 11:19.427
- No, I'm not
getting in the water.

11:19.462 --> 11:20.645
- Okay.

11:20.681 --> 11:21.730
- I'm still, you know,
recovering.

11:21.765 --> 11:22.564
- Okay.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.899
- You look good, though.
- Thank you.

11:24.935 --> 11:28.603
Last year, I had almost
a breakdown leaving one baby.

11:28.638 --> 11:30.488
- Michael is not watching
dean this weekend?

11:30.524 --> 11:33.158
- No, no,
I can't be away from him.

11:33.193 --> 11:37.145
As a mother of two,
I am able to leave the nest

11:37.164 --> 11:40.215
and actually
enjoy myself.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.349
- And this is butt action.

11:41.385 --> 11:43.151
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.820
- The fact that you're even
here, ashley, I'm for it.

11:45.856 --> 11:47.589
- It's a miracle.
- Aww, thank you.

11:47.624 --> 11:50.592
I decided to encapsulate
my placenta.

11:52.996 --> 11:56.765
[gagging]

11:56.800 --> 11:57.849
- and put it into
some pills,

11:57.884 --> 12:00.852
and I do already feel
a little bit of a difference

12:00.887 --> 12:02.103
in my mood.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.504
- Bleh!

12:03.523 --> 12:06.608
Okay, I do dry heave.
Forgive me.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.728
- I feel great.
I feel warm.

12:09.780 --> 12:10.562
- I'm gonna throw up.

12:10.614 --> 12:12.313
- I wanna be present
with you guys.

12:12.348 --> 12:14.149
I wanna be here.
I wanna have fun.

12:14.184 --> 12:15.066
You know,
look at everybody

12:15.118 --> 12:16.618
wearing condoms
on their heads and stuff.

12:16.653 --> 12:17.519
I mean, how could I
miss this?

12:17.554 --> 12:19.387
- It's a sisterhood.
It's a sisterhood.

12:19.423 --> 12:20.555
- Make sure
you point your toe.

12:20.590 --> 12:21.589
Point your toe.

12:21.625 --> 12:22.791
- So, tell me what's been
happening on the trip.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.075
You guys got here yesterday.

12:24.127 --> 12:26.961
- I have been the target
of gizelle's aggression,

12:26.997 --> 12:27.912
and I survived it.

12:27.964 --> 12:30.915
So, this outfit
is my wonder woman outfit.

12:30.967 --> 12:31.800
[laughing]

12:31.835 --> 12:34.869
I-- I survived
the failed coup attempt.

12:34.888 --> 12:37.405
- The failed
coup attempt, okay.

12:37.441 --> 12:39.340
- I think I gotta
get in the water.
It's hot.

12:39.375 --> 12:40.725
- Okay,
what was she saying?

12:40.761 --> 12:43.411
- I'm a liar.
I'm a troll.

12:43.447 --> 12:46.014
- Do you think maybe
you can ca a truce?

12:46.049 --> 12:51.653
- She still owes some type
of ownership to my kids.

12:51.688 --> 12:52.720
I'm not--
- to your kids?

12:52.739 --> 12:55.406
- Not me.
- Okay.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.592
- Ladies,
class will be complete.

12:57.627 --> 13:00.195
- Thank you.

13:00.230 --> 13:00.995
- All right,
I'm gonna get out

13:01.031 --> 13:02.130
'cause I gotta get ready
for lunch.

13:02.165 --> 13:05.416
- It wasn't just an attack
on me at the dinner table.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.451
She came at candiace.

13:06.503 --> 13:08.870
Then she went down
for her dear friend, robyn.

13:08.905 --> 13:11.873
And let me tell ya,
she hopped on over to wendy.

13:11.908 --> 13:14.375
She says, "basically,
you're lacking substance."

13:14.410 --> 13:17.946
she cried.
She was so hurt.

13:17.981 --> 13:18.763
- What? Whoa.

13:18.799 --> 13:19.747
This doesn't sound
like my friend.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.634
- No, that is--
- do you know what I mean?

13:22.686 --> 13:24.585
Karen usually
tells the truth.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.420
Well, sometimes.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.756
- I think, as a friend
and as a sister,

13:28.775 --> 13:30.441
she should probably have had
that one-on-one conversation.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.810
- I-I agree.

13:31.862 --> 13:34.979
- Because what if she was
going through something?

13:35.031 --> 13:37.465
- But if gizelle
gets into the equation,

13:37.501 --> 13:39.284
all of a sudden,
karen goes into

13:39.319 --> 13:41.602
a bit of a fable,
if you will.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.604
- It was brutal.
- Brutal? Lord.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.456
- It was brutal.
- Where is she?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.108
[laughing]
I gotta figure this out.

13:47.143 --> 13:49.477
- But anyway, I'm burning up,
so I'm gonna go change.

13:49.513 --> 13:51.479
- We're gonna go
to lunch soon.

13:51.515 --> 13:53.631
Change now for lunch
and whiskey tasting.

13:53.667 --> 13:54.499
- Okay, let me pick out
my wedgie,

13:54.551 --> 13:56.885
so y'all can have
a "baywatch" moment.

13:56.920 --> 14:00.722
- Oh, oh, oh, pardon me.
[laughing]

14:00.757 --> 14:02.991
I must say that's actually
quite flattering.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.147
- You probably haven't
seen the house.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.398
I want to give you
like, a little tour?

14:10.433 --> 14:11.933
- Oh, yes, thank you.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.236
Oh, this is so beautiful.
- Yes.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.508
- This is a bed for two.

14:20.544 --> 14:22.827
- Well, I said
that you can stay.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.829
- I'm actually quite drunk now
from these two beers.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.148
So...
[laughing]

14:27.183 --> 14:28.850
- oh, you have to be
like drunk karen.

14:28.885 --> 14:30.418
[sighs]
- gizelle...

14:30.453 --> 14:31.920
You know what,
I can't wit' y'all.

14:31.955 --> 14:34.422
You're relentless,
the two of you.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.540
- How are things
going there?

14:35.592 --> 14:39.060
- Unfortunately, gizelle
is up to her dysfunctional self.

14:39.095 --> 14:40.628
- Really?
- Yes, and, you know,

14:40.663 --> 14:42.881
these girls, they're not
buying it anymore.

14:44.768 --> 14:46.517
- You're right.
I've got things to celebrate.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.102
I'm doin' the damn thing.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.539
- That's right.

14:51.575 --> 14:53.674
- You had an interesting
night I hear.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.543
Karen said,
"gizelle went around

14:55.579 --> 14:58.029
"and attacked
everybody's life."

14:58.064 --> 14:59.247
- I wasn't trying
to badger nobody

14:59.282 --> 15:00.315
in the--
at the table.

15:00.350 --> 15:02.233
- Okay, okay. All right.
Keep going. I'm listening.

15:02.285 --> 15:06.905
- Okay. So, we've all seen
some changes in wendy, right?

15:06.957 --> 15:08.239
- Yeah.
- Physically.

15:08.291 --> 15:09.123
- Yeah.
- But, like,

15:09.159 --> 15:11.125
I told her I can't put
my finger on it,

15:11.161 --> 15:12.377
but it's like,
you're totally different

15:12.412 --> 15:13.962
from the girl that I met.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.263
Like, last year,
you were the girl

15:15.298 --> 15:16.915
of, like,
super substance,

15:16.967 --> 15:18.800
and now you're, like,
sexy hot mama.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.101
Not that
you can't do both

15:20.136 --> 15:22.003
but, for me, it's like
from left field.

15:22.038 --> 15:24.055
- Yeah, that's valid
mainly because of

15:24.090 --> 15:26.724
how she reinforced,
you know, the professor.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.393
I mean, that's, like,
it was such a big part

15:28.428 --> 15:29.894
of her identity.
What's the cause?

15:29.930 --> 15:32.730
What's the underlying why?

15:32.766 --> 15:33.898
- One hundred percent.

15:33.934 --> 15:37.769
So, she got defensive,
and it wasn't, like, combative.

15:37.821 --> 15:39.220
It was just like
a real question.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.221
- Right.

15:40.256 --> 15:44.158
Karen said she cried
in her arms this morning.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.777
- That's her own
internal bullsh--.

15:45.829 --> 15:47.862
That don't have nothin'
to do with gizelle.

15:47.897 --> 15:48.830
I'm gonna ask her
if she felt uncomfortable

15:48.865 --> 15:50.865
in any-- in any capacity
'cause, like, that--

15:50.900 --> 15:52.917
that was not
what last night was about.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.035
So, I don't know what
karen is talking about,

15:54.070 --> 15:58.923
but I am feeling like maybe
the rumors online with--

15:58.959 --> 16:01.092
- eddie.
- Yeah.

16:01.127 --> 16:05.296
Maybe that might be driving
her to show the people,

16:05.348 --> 16:07.966
like, I'm in this hot,
sexy space with my husband.

16:08.018 --> 16:08.967
- Right.
- Should we bring it up?

16:09.019 --> 16:10.852
Should we leave it alone?
- I feel like maybe

16:10.887 --> 16:13.354
it's something we can
talk about at lunch.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.990
You and I have both had rumors
about us out there.

16:16.026 --> 16:16.975
- Yes.

16:17.027 --> 16:19.227
- And that hasn't
been motive

16:19.262 --> 16:22.864
to change who we are
so drastically.

16:22.899 --> 16:27.368
I don't believe that the rumors
about eddie are true,

16:27.404 --> 16:30.788
but there is also something
that seems to have changed

16:30.824 --> 16:32.273

16:32.308 --> 16:34.292
and how she's interacting
with the group.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.628
- Maybe I won't talk
since I had a gun and machete,

16:37.664 --> 16:38.629
and I just killed everybody
last night.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.915
- I know.
[laughing]

16:40.950 --> 16:42.250

16:42.285 --> 16:44.118
- I have never judged you
for being a stripper.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.887
- I wasn't a trip--
a stripper.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.638
I was an entertainer
at a five star restaurant

16:47.674 --> 16:50.058

steak and lobster.

17:21.574 --> 17:22.857

17:22.876 --> 17:24.158

17:25.412 --> 17:26.828
- Candiace, we coulda
walked this maybe.

17:26.863 --> 17:29.163

- We probably could have.

17:29.199 --> 17:30.164
We're here.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.667
- But, you know,
I'm grateful for the ride.

17:32.702 --> 17:34.202
- Hi, ladies. Welcome to
the james landing grille.

17:34.237 --> 17:36.504

17:36.539 --> 17:37.705

17:45.899 --> 17:47.882
but just, like, really need

17:47.901 --> 17:49.100

17:58.561 --> 18:00.027

- Um, yes.

18:03.299 --> 18:05.867

[laughing]

18:05.902 --> 18:09.270
- can I do
a lemon drop martini?

18:09.305 --> 18:11.072
- Can I have a grey goose
dirty martini?

18:11.107 --> 18:12.874
- Whoo! We partyin'.

18:12.909 --> 18:15.576
- All right, we're doing
whiskey after this.

18:15.612 --> 18:17.245
Don't...
- This is to get me started.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.045
- Askale,
how are you doing?

18:18.081 --> 18:19.914
I haven't seen you
since the spa.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.416
- I'm doing good.
We're having a great time.

18:22.452 --> 18:23.351
- Okay.
- We had a little,

18:23.386 --> 18:26.287
you know, situation
at dinner yesterday.

18:26.322 --> 18:27.522
- Ladies,
we're ready to order?

18:27.557 --> 18:28.439
- Oh.
- A salad.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.791
- Okay.

18:29.826 --> 18:31.559
- The mahi, please.
- Okay.

18:31.594 --> 18:33.611
- The caesar salad
but no croutons.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.129
Thank you, ma'am.

18:35.165 --> 18:37.615
- May I have the turkey club
with no bacon, please?

18:37.650 --> 18:38.366
Sh--, I thought I was--
- the greek salad

18:38.401 --> 18:40.201
with the shrimp
on the top.

18:40.236 --> 18:41.285
- Mahi.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.287
- And somethin' for robyn.
I think she wants mahi.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.772
- Okay.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.126
- You had a situation
at dinner?

18:48.161 --> 18:50.111
So, gizelle filled me in
a little bit earlier,

18:50.146 --> 18:51.963
and there's a disconnect
in between what's happening

18:51.998 --> 18:53.948
and, like, what other people
are saying to me.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.450
It was described to me
about how the conversation

18:56.469 --> 18:58.619
went last night,
was that

18:58.638 --> 19:02.056
it was like gizelle
was attacking everybody.

19:02.091 --> 19:06.661
- Can I say somethin'?
Wendy, are we good?

19:06.696 --> 19:08.763
- I was going to
talk to you about it.

19:08.798 --> 19:11.516
When we were there
last night at dinner,

19:11.568 --> 19:15.303
you said to me, "last year,
you had substance."

19:15.338 --> 19:18.272
- mm-hmm.
- "this year,

19:18.308 --> 19:19.323
"I don't know
who you are,

19:19.359 --> 19:21.609
"and I can't put
my finger on it."

19:21.644 --> 19:22.977
that's what you said,
verbatim.

19:23.012 --> 19:24.645
- Okay.
- When you made those comments,

19:24.664 --> 19:25.530
that hurt me.

19:25.582 --> 19:27.348
I felt as though
you're body shaming me.

19:27.383 --> 19:28.783
Like, okay,
you need to cover up.

19:28.818 --> 19:29.817
Why have I seen
so much of your boobies?

19:29.853 --> 19:30.918
- Never said that.
Never said that.

19:30.954 --> 19:32.336
- I-- wendy, I really don't
think it was that way.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.487
- Can-- wait, wait.
Can I-- can I, um--

19:33.506 --> 19:34.488
- but that's how I felt.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.656
This is why I've always
experienced people--

19:35.692 --> 19:37.625
- but that's your sh--, right?
- Yeah, that's my sh--.

19:37.660 --> 19:40.127
- So, why then you mad
at gizelle for your sh--?

19:40.163 --> 19:42.930
- Because it was the comment
of you saying,

19:42.966 --> 19:44.515
"when I met you last year,
you had substance."

19:44.551 --> 19:46.000
- yeah.
- That was it.

19:46.035 --> 19:47.101
- Oh, that was it.

19:47.136 --> 19:48.803
- That was the only thing
I did have to cosign. Yes.

19:48.838 --> 19:50.021
- Yeah.
- It felt like yesterday

19:50.056 --> 19:51.839
I was on, like,
interrogation island.

19:51.875 --> 19:54.075
- It was just kinda like,
hey, wendy, like, checkin' in.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.977
Like--
- thank you.

19:56.012 --> 19:57.311
- If you felt like
I offended you,

19:57.346 --> 19:59.213
my bad.
That was not my purpose.

20:02.986 --> 20:04.919
- Her apology
is not genuine.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.787
If she was really
my friend,

20:06.823 --> 20:07.855
she would have
pulled me to the side

20:07.874 --> 20:09.356
to have that conversation

20:09.375 --> 20:11.626
instead of trying
to humiliate me

20:11.661 --> 20:13.044
in front of
the whole group.

20:13.079 --> 20:13.961
- Did you cry?

20:13.997 --> 20:14.862
Karen said that
you were very emotional.

20:14.898 --> 20:17.732
- I did. When karen
was talking to me,

20:17.767 --> 20:21.252
she poured into me,

20:21.304 --> 20:23.554
and that meant
the world to me.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.056
- You're welcome.

20:29.812 --> 20:33.214
- What the f?
Wtf?

20:33.249 --> 20:35.950
Chile, whatever.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.719
- I will forever
appreciate that.

20:38.755 --> 20:40.988
- That's beautiful.
- Let's be clear.

20:41.024 --> 20:43.758
Wendy, karen really
doesn't like you.

20:43.793 --> 20:47.194
Candiace and karen
used to have the same

20:47.230 --> 20:49.697
mommy dearest
dysfunctional relationship.

20:49.732 --> 20:51.415
So, go right ahead

20:51.451 --> 20:53.618
and fall in
the mother goose trap.

20:53.670 --> 20:56.170
- Look at god.
- All: Hi.

20:56.205 --> 20:57.238
- Hi, robyn.
- Hi.

20:57.273 --> 20:58.572
- I was like, who is that
hot girl walkin' in here?

20:58.591 --> 20:59.907
- Oh.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.810
What did I miss?
A lot?

21:02.845 --> 21:04.578
- Wendy was offended
by what I said last night.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.913
Um, one hundred percent,

21:05.949 --> 21:07.615
said she didn't have
any substance.

21:07.650 --> 21:08.749
- Oh, okay.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.635
- Quite frankly,
to gizelle's defense--

21:10.687 --> 21:11.719
- you love a defense.

21:11.754 --> 21:13.938
- Any time I do see a lady
who is more revealing,

21:13.973 --> 21:15.756
I just--
I like to check in,

21:15.775 --> 21:19.560
and so I can see where
she was coming for-- for.

21:19.595 --> 21:20.594
- People have
plastic surgery,

21:20.630 --> 21:23.197
and this is part of why
people don't say stuff

21:23.232 --> 21:24.699
because then-- hold on.
Let me finish.

21:24.734 --> 21:25.599
- Wendy, that's not right.
- Ashley, I'm not done.

21:25.635 --> 21:26.767
- I have to tell you.
That's not right.

21:26.803 --> 21:27.835
- Wendy, that's not true.
- I'm not done. Let me finish.

21:27.870 --> 21:28.903
- Wendy, no one is talking
just about your breasts.

21:31.140 --> 21:32.606
- We're talking that your
behavior is just different.

21:32.642 --> 21:33.774
- Let me finish.
- That's all.

21:33.810 --> 21:34.709
- Ashley, I haven't even--
- but, wendy, you're saying

21:34.744 --> 21:35.443
stuff that's not true.
- So, please stop.

21:35.478 --> 21:36.410
- It's not about
your breasts.

21:36.446 --> 21:38.479
Because both times
I've seen you,

21:38.514 --> 21:39.513
you have been parading yor
breasts, and that's okay.

21:39.549 --> 21:41.465
- Ashley, but you just said--
you just said--

21:41.501 --> 21:44.485
- ashley's breast pump
and her forehead just got here.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.787
Why is she even
inserting herself

21:46.806 --> 21:48.956
in a conversation that
she knows nothing about?

21:48.975 --> 21:52.476
Why are these girls
trying their damndest

21:52.512 --> 21:55.262
to make something else
of the situation?

21:55.297 --> 21:56.230
- Why are you getting hype?
- Because you're--

21:56.265 --> 21:57.348
- please calm down
because this is about me.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.199
- You're telling me to be quiet,
and I'm telling you--

21:58.234 --> 21:59.333
- I'm not telling you
to be quiet.

21:59.369 --> 22:01.902
- ...That you're missing
the point of the conversation.

22:01.938 --> 22:03.504
- Some people
don't wanna hear

22:03.539 --> 22:06.073
what people are observing.
- Yeah.

22:06.109 --> 22:07.692
- And-and like I said,
sometimes it is

22:07.744 --> 22:08.976
difficult truth.
- Yeah.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.477
- I don't think it's
a difficult truth.

22:10.496 --> 22:11.362
Honestly, I think--

22:11.414 --> 22:12.613
I think part of this is--
- but the, no,

22:12.648 --> 22:14.982
the truth is, we've observed--
why are you cutting me off?

22:15.001 --> 22:16.667
- Because I was talking,
and you cut me off.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.152
- You always
cut people off.

22:18.187 --> 22:20.821
- I didn't cut you off.
You gotta stop this.

22:20.840 --> 22:25.960

23:59.722 --> 24:01.088
- Yes, exactly.

24:01.124 --> 24:04.125
- Shortly after serving drinks,
yes, I did become a stripper.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.277
Most of the time,
my clients never wanted me

24:06.312 --> 24:07.445
to take my clothes off.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.063
No, it's different.

24:09.098 --> 24:13.200
- Girl, you were
a lady of the night,

24:13.236 --> 24:14.602
period.

24:14.637 --> 24:16.787
Wit' your big ol' feet.

24:20.276 --> 24:22.076
- I just find it rich,

24:22.111 --> 24:24.311
the commentary
coming from you.

24:24.347 --> 24:25.913
I will receive it,
but because we've never--

24:25.948 --> 24:27.047
- but I didn't wear those
outfits out in public.

24:27.083 --> 24:28.883
- So, basically, you're
saying because of her past,

24:28.918 --> 24:31.051
she can't have commentary.
Like, that ain't right.

24:31.087 --> 24:32.386
- That's not fair.
- You heard what I said.

24:32.421 --> 24:34.355
That's not what I said.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.724
- In the past, I worked
at a gentleman's club

24:36.759 --> 24:38.726
to provide for my babies.

24:38.761 --> 24:40.845
You definitely want
to show your assets.

24:40.897 --> 24:42.396
That's how you make money.

24:42.431 --> 24:43.731
But we're on
a girls' trip.

24:43.766 --> 24:44.765
We don't need
to see your assets.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.817
We're not paying you.

24:48.738 --> 24:50.488
- And so, my husband--
- come on.

24:50.523 --> 24:51.939
- That fine chocolate man--
- yes.

24:51.974 --> 24:54.475
- He knows how much I have
sacrificed for our kids,

24:54.510 --> 24:57.328
for our family, and the fact
that he's even able to say,

24:57.363 --> 25:01.148
"I'm so glad you are happy
with who you are,"

25:01.184 --> 25:02.917
eddie wins.

25:04.954 --> 25:07.338
- We might as well just
keep our observations

25:07.373 --> 25:08.255
to our self.

25:08.291 --> 25:09.707
- I'll tell you how
I feel, right now.

25:09.759 --> 25:13.360
You are hella,
h-e-l-l-a, judgmental.

25:13.396 --> 25:14.628
- Oh, my god.
- Okay.

25:14.663 --> 25:16.030
- First of all,

25:16.065 --> 25:19.833
if we're going to judge
anybody's fashions,

25:19.852 --> 25:23.938
gizelle would be sentenced
to life in prison,

25:23.973 --> 25:25.773
under the jail.

25:25.808 --> 25:29.476
Second of all, why can't
we all just get along?

25:29.512 --> 25:31.695
I have provided ambience,

25:31.731 --> 25:33.013
and y'all
are still fighting!

25:33.049 --> 25:34.548
How many more days?

25:34.584 --> 25:35.950
This is--
that's where I am.

25:35.985 --> 25:37.701
On a lighter note,
whiskey tasting is, I think,

25:37.737 --> 25:39.537
in, like, 30 minutes.
- Okay.

25:39.572 --> 25:41.038
- Okay.
- Yeah.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.456
- So, we need
the little girls room
before we go.

25:42.491 --> 25:43.541
- It's cold, right?

25:43.576 --> 25:44.542
- Cold down here
in the streets.

25:44.577 --> 25:46.093
- I know.
- Yeah, it's cold
in the streets.

25:46.128 --> 25:46.911
- Okay.

25:49.298 --> 25:50.331
- Mm-hmm.

25:54.737 --> 25:56.203
Mm-hmm.

25:56.222 --> 25:59.139
I'm feeling bad now
because I really do

25:59.175 --> 26:00.374
wanna talk
about it with her,

26:00.393 --> 26:02.726
but it'd be better
coming from one person

26:02.762 --> 26:04.711
versus the group,
I think.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.580
She may take it better
if it's, like,

26:06.616 --> 26:09.383
from, well, me.

26:09.402 --> 26:12.403
And maybe she feels like
it's kinda chipping away

26:12.438 --> 26:14.939
at the armor.

26:14.991 --> 26:15.856
- I'm done with wendy.

26:15.891 --> 26:18.025
I'm talking to her
about anything else

26:18.060 --> 26:20.327
outside of her braids,

26:20.363 --> 26:22.596
because clearly
she can't handle it.

26:22.632 --> 26:23.730
- I'm gonna ask her.
- Okay.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.867
Every year, there's another
break the internet moment

26:26.902 --> 26:28.002
with michael darby.

26:28.037 --> 26:32.172
If anybody can understand
and empathize, it's ashley.

26:32.208 --> 26:34.592
This conversation would be
better received from her.

26:34.627 --> 26:36.794
- Going back to the house.

26:40.416 --> 26:45.786
♪♪

26:45.821 --> 26:47.621
- what are we doing?
- The whiskey is coming.

26:47.657 --> 26:49.440
So, freshen up.
- Okay.

26:49.475 --> 26:50.774
All right.
Let's do that.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.726
I don't know the first thing
about whiskey.

26:52.761 --> 26:55.195
[laughing]

26:55.231 --> 26:57.031
- you okay?

26:57.066 --> 26:59.767
Ooh, girl, all right.
[laughing]

26:59.802 --> 27:01.819
- I often put up
a brave face,

27:01.871 --> 27:03.370
but the truth
of the matter is,

27:03.406 --> 27:06.307
I want my girlfriends
to rally around me.

27:06.342 --> 27:09.410
I want them to uplift me
when I'm feeling weak.

27:09.445 --> 27:11.645
But right now, I'm really
struggling to get that

27:11.681 --> 27:13.514
from my circle
of friends.

27:13.549 --> 27:17.451
I just wanna be wendy.
So, it's very hard.

27:17.486 --> 27:19.653
- Thank you, robyn.
- You're welcome.

27:19.689 --> 27:21.305
This door is heavy.

27:21.340 --> 27:25.142
- Be ready to have
some fun, okay?

27:25.177 --> 27:28.329
- Oh, let us in.
[knocking]

27:28.364 --> 27:29.980
- you're not gonna keep
doing this now.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.649
It's not fair.
- Welcome to my home.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.517
- Candiace wavin' like hi.

27:33.569 --> 27:34.968
- Hi.

27:35.004 --> 27:37.438
- Oh, all right.

27:37.473 --> 27:39.990
I'll let myself in.

27:43.195 --> 27:45.329
- Candiace, what's
the eta on this whiskey?

27:45.364 --> 27:46.813
- What time is it?
He should be here.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.832
[doorbell rings]

27:48.868 --> 27:50.868
- ooh, look,
they're here!

27:53.456 --> 27:54.521
- Candiace?
- Yes.

27:54.557 --> 27:55.822
- I am rick wasmund.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.675
Your whiskey is here,
young lady.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.593
- Yay!

27:59.628 --> 28:01.045
Oh, look at this.

28:01.097 --> 28:03.097
We're excited to
taste all the whiskey.

28:03.132 --> 28:04.465
- Well, we're excited
to pour it for you.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.100
- Awesome.
- We'll bring some things in.

28:06.135 --> 28:10.003
- My goal is to just pump
these girls full of alcohol

28:10.022 --> 28:12.639
in the hopes that
it will slow them down

28:12.675 --> 28:15.225
and shut them
the (bleep) up

28:15.277 --> 28:18.879
because I'm tired of talking
about wendy and her titties.

28:18.914 --> 28:22.066
Drink these drinks
and be quiet.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.903
- Like, in the next
30 minutes or so, I think.

28:28.491 --> 28:29.689
- Mm-hmm.
- I know.

28:29.709 --> 28:30.708
She's upset about somethin'.

28:30.743 --> 28:32.242
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

28:32.294 --> 28:32.960
- Hi.

28:32.995 --> 28:34.128
- My name is
rick wasmund,

28:34.163 --> 28:37.581
and I am the owner and founder
of copper fox distillery,

28:37.633 --> 28:40.867
but we are thankful to, um,
pour you guys some whiskey

28:40.886 --> 28:42.536
and make you
some cocktails.

28:42.555 --> 28:44.555
Here you go.
- Thank you.

28:44.590 --> 28:45.739
- Thank you.

28:45.775 --> 28:48.175
- Oh, sh--, we all get one.
- Yes, everybody gets one.

28:48.210 --> 28:49.727
Yes.
- Oh, jesus.

28:49.762 --> 28:50.728
We ain't gonna
make it to dinner.

28:50.763 --> 28:51.729
[laughing]

28:51.764 --> 28:52.646
my ass is gonna
be passed out

28:52.681 --> 28:55.599
right here on the ground.
- Thank you.

28:55.651 --> 28:56.900
- There you go.
- Yes.

28:56.936 --> 28:57.918
- I like these
little glasses.

28:57.953 --> 28:59.052
- They're cute, right?
- Yeah.

28:59.071 --> 29:01.572
- So, whiskey is made from
a fermented mash of grain,

29:01.607 --> 29:04.441
um, that's then, uh,
kinda brewed into here

29:04.493 --> 29:05.743
and then distilled,

29:05.778 --> 29:07.528
but when we
age the whiskey,

29:07.563 --> 29:10.164
we do an insertion
of toasted applewood

29:10.199 --> 29:12.249
and toasted oakwood chips.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.133
So, have a sip.
- Okay.

29:13.169 --> 29:15.269
- Oh, sip? We sip.

29:17.606 --> 29:20.924
- So, this is a rye whiskey,
so a little peppery.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.093
- Whoo!

29:23.129 --> 29:24.411
- Oh, my gosh,
that's a lot.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.763
- It's good.
I ain't mad at it.

29:25.798 --> 29:27.581
- Mm-hmm. [indistinct].

29:27.616 --> 29:30.684
- Number two is
our original single malt,

29:30.719 --> 29:32.436
but it's 100%
malted barley.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.455
It's smoked with
applewood and cherrywood.

29:34.490 --> 29:35.189
- Okay.

29:35.224 --> 29:36.974
- Oh, this is
burning my lips.

29:37.026 --> 29:39.143
- Doesn't have the pepperiness
of the first one.

29:39.195 --> 29:40.727
- Wait.
- Whoo!

29:40.763 --> 29:42.196
- Wait.

29:42.231 --> 29:43.530
No way.
We're not there yet.

29:43.566 --> 29:45.065
- Omg.

29:45.100 --> 29:46.600
- Robyn. Robyn.

29:46.635 --> 29:49.403
- Come up for air.

29:49.438 --> 29:50.654
- No!

29:50.706 --> 29:52.039
[screaming]
- oh, my god!

29:52.074 --> 29:54.107
- We didn't even
get the explanation.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.943
- Well, come on.
You're almost done.

29:55.978 --> 29:57.444
Drink the last one.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.662
- You only
live once, robyn.

29:58.714 --> 29:59.446
- No.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.999
- Robyn. Robyn.
- Bad influence.

30:02.051 --> 30:04.284
- Take the last one, robyn.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.119
- Because ashley
made it here.

30:06.138 --> 30:09.473
She's got a three week--
week old baby at home,

30:09.508 --> 30:10.507
and she can't do it.
- Oh, it's kickin' in.

30:10.559 --> 30:12.810
- I'm gonna do it for her!
- Thank you, robyn.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.311
- Yes, robyn!
- Wow!

30:14.346 --> 30:15.696
- Whoo!

30:15.731 --> 30:17.998
- Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

30:18.033 --> 30:19.800
- Another round?
- Yes.

30:19.835 --> 30:21.134
- No. Wait.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.303
- I'm about to
be drunk, y'all.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.639
- We have a cocktail to go
with the rye whiskey.

30:25.674 --> 30:28.108
- Ooh.
- Oh, boy.

30:28.143 --> 30:30.677
- This is a rye daquiri
made with fresh cinnamon

30:30.713 --> 30:31.845
and lime juice.

30:31.881 --> 30:33.813
- Ooh.

30:33.833 --> 30:34.581
- Okay.

30:34.617 --> 30:36.416
[laughing]
- number three is--

30:39.088 --> 30:39.837
- I am.

30:39.872 --> 30:41.505
- At a rodeo?
- Yeah.

30:41.540 --> 30:42.990
- You're giving me everything.
- I ain't sorry.

30:43.025 --> 30:43.841
- I could just sit
right here right--

30:43.876 --> 30:45.692
all night,
and I'll be like--

30:45.728 --> 30:46.710
oh, sh--.
- Oh, yeah.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.862
She's gonna
need another one.

30:48.898 --> 30:51.181
- Mr. Copper fox.
- Not mr. Copper cox.

30:51.217 --> 30:53.183
- No, not cox-- fox.

30:57.907 --> 31:00.140
- Oh, god.

31:00.175 --> 31:01.575
- I mean, it's just I would
like to talk to you

31:01.610 --> 31:03.360
to the side.

31:05.514 --> 31:06.547
- What they
went out doing?

31:06.582 --> 31:07.614
- Ashley is gettin'
ready to go,

31:07.650 --> 31:09.316
so whatever ashley want
to say, let her say it.

31:11.153 --> 31:12.369
- Coming up next...

31:12.404 --> 31:13.537
- I have never
brought anything

31:13.572 --> 31:14.854
from a mother----in'
blog to you.

31:14.874 --> 31:15.789
- No, you just fed it.
You just fed it for
a long time.

31:15.824 --> 31:17.574
- Tells me what I need
to know about you.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.409
Take your milk and
get the (bleep) out.

31:22.397 --> 31:23.463
- Wendy, I'm actually
about to go.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.633
- Oh, god.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.518
- I mean, it's just I would
like to talk to you

31:28.571 --> 31:30.404
to the side.

31:30.439 --> 31:33.974
When candiace and gizelle
told me about michael

31:33.993 --> 31:34.942
in the strip club,

31:34.977 --> 31:38.028
I appreciated the fact
that they came to me

31:38.080 --> 31:39.329
as a woman
on the side.

31:39.365 --> 31:41.648
He has a boyfriend
and a wife?

31:41.684 --> 31:45.002
He was asking who he can
take to a hotel nearby?

31:45.037 --> 31:46.653
I will talk to
my husband about it.

31:46.672 --> 31:49.840
Presenting it to her this
way helps her to understand

31:49.875 --> 31:52.292
that I'm not doing
it to be messy.

31:52.328 --> 31:55.345
Perhaps this could bring
wendy and I closer together

31:55.381 --> 31:58.298
because we do share
the commonality

31:58.333 --> 32:00.434
of someone coming
for your marriage.

32:03.639 --> 32:05.439
You know, I wasn't
at the dinner last night

32:05.474 --> 32:08.025
to know, like, all
that was said, right?

32:08.060 --> 32:12.345
But gizelle told me how there
is this fabricated article

32:12.364 --> 32:15.399
about eddie or whatever
having an affair or something.

32:15.451 --> 32:17.868
This has been discussed
if that's one of the reasons

32:17.903 --> 32:21.855
why you are stepping in to
be more of, like, sexual,

32:21.874 --> 32:23.740
why you and eddie
are more free,

32:23.792 --> 32:25.626
because you're showing people,
like, this-- there--

32:25.661 --> 32:27.411
there obviously is
no truth to that.

32:27.463 --> 32:28.712
- Okay, we're not
talking about that

32:28.747 --> 32:29.997
because that's a lie.

32:30.032 --> 32:33.250
But I thank you
so much for, um,

32:33.302 --> 32:35.335
trying to find
this opportunity

32:35.370 --> 32:37.037
to try to attack
my marriage.

32:37.072 --> 32:39.172
- Why is this where
you're choosing to go?

32:39.208 --> 32:40.240
Why-why are you getting
so defensive in that way?

32:40.275 --> 32:41.725
- No, I'm-- no, no,
because you-- first of all,

32:41.760 --> 32:43.393
the fact that you're
bringing this to me,

32:43.429 --> 32:46.096
I find it laughable.

32:46.148 --> 32:47.597
Like, with gizelle,

32:47.650 --> 32:50.150
the same way she wanted
to have the conversation

32:50.185 --> 32:51.435
with me at dinner,

32:51.487 --> 32:53.403
if you really were
hearing these things,

32:53.439 --> 32:55.322
why didn't she do this?

32:57.159 --> 32:58.525
- Promise you gizelle
and I were not--

32:58.560 --> 33:00.160
we've never talked
about you maliciously.

33:00.195 --> 33:01.445
This is not, like,
something we talked about

33:01.497 --> 33:03.330
to be like,
hee-hee-hee-hee, ha-ha-ha.

33:04.833 --> 33:05.666
I'm serious.

33:05.701 --> 33:07.451
- I feel like it is
because gizelle--

33:07.503 --> 33:08.869
that-that's
gizelle's personality.

33:08.904 --> 33:11.705
In her heart, yeah,
it was completely evil.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.457
- I don't think so.
- I think so.

33:13.509 --> 33:15.459
- I think it's
because, last night,

33:15.511 --> 33:17.544
it was already so fractured,
your relationship.

33:17.579 --> 33:20.130
- She didn't know until today
that it hurt me.

33:20.182 --> 33:22.516
So, last night, she
could have talked to me.

33:22.551 --> 33:24.284
She chose not to.
- That's fair.

33:24.319 --> 33:27.137
- But, yeah, she's definitely
a spawn of the devil.

33:27.189 --> 33:28.355
- Oh, dear, okay.

33:28.390 --> 33:30.190
- I'm just gonna do
a quick toast.

33:30.225 --> 33:33.143
There are good ships,
and there are wood ships,

33:33.195 --> 33:34.811
the ships that sail
the sea.

33:34.863 --> 33:36.113
- Yes.

33:36.148 --> 33:39.199
- But the best ships
are the friendships.

33:39.234 --> 33:40.901
- Aww.
- The friendships.

33:40.936 --> 33:42.402
- And may they always be.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.538
- Aww.
- That's nice.

33:44.573 --> 33:45.906
- Cha-ching-ching.
- Cheers.

33:45.941 --> 33:47.440
- Cha-ching-ching.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.459
- I read so much bad stuff
about you, ashley,

33:49.495 --> 33:50.744
you and your husband.
- Of course.

33:50.779 --> 33:53.246
- I read so much bad stuff
about gizelle,

33:53.281 --> 33:55.332
so many evil things
about robyn.

33:55.384 --> 33:56.783
- I see it.
- Don't--

33:56.802 --> 33:57.417
don't make sh-- up.

33:57.452 --> 33:58.785
- Yes, I'm not!
- No.

33:58.804 --> 34:00.220
Yes, you are.

34:00.255 --> 34:01.855
- There's some poppage.
- Oh, let me-let me stick

34:01.890 --> 34:02.856
to my right side.
- Yes!

34:02.891 --> 34:04.474
[laughing]

34:04.510 --> 34:06.476
- but you guys chose
to bring up the thing

34:06.512 --> 34:08.261
about me and my husband.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.480
That speaks about
your character.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.733
If that's
what we're doing,

34:12.768 --> 34:14.634
let's have at it.

34:20.576 --> 34:22.275
- All right.
Are you guys all done?

34:22.310 --> 34:24.327
- Yes.
Thank you so much.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.346
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

34:27.416 --> 34:28.815
- Okay, okay.
- Pop it, pop it, pop it.

34:28.851 --> 34:30.751
Pop it, pop it, pop it
- hey, hey, hey.

34:30.786 --> 34:33.019
[laughing]

34:33.055 --> 34:35.388
- yes!

34:35.424 --> 34:36.706
- Hey, guys,
since we're all twerking,

34:36.759 --> 34:39.009
I just wanna have
a conversation.

34:39.044 --> 34:40.193
- Oh, dear.

34:40.229 --> 34:41.878
- Ashley brought to me

34:41.930 --> 34:44.514
something in which
she said

34:44.550 --> 34:47.384
you guys saw in a blog

34:47.436 --> 34:49.335
about my husband.

34:49.354 --> 34:51.271
- Who is-who is y'all?

34:51.306 --> 34:52.939
- She-she said
gizelle's name,

34:52.975 --> 34:54.007
but I don't know
who it is.

34:54.026 --> 34:56.226
So, you can-- was it you?

34:56.278 --> 34:57.527
Was it you?
- Absolutely not.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.045
- Wendy.
- Was it you?

34:59.081 --> 35:00.647
- Absolutely not.

35:00.682 --> 35:02.699
- I don't know about eddie.
I don't know about eddie.

35:02.734 --> 35:03.683
- Was it you?

35:03.719 --> 35:04.701
- I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

35:04.736 --> 35:05.719
[slurping]

35:05.754 --> 35:08.205
- let's be very clear.
Don't attack my husband.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.556
- Yeah.

35:09.591 --> 35:11.408
- Because that's something
I do not play with.

35:11.460 --> 35:12.826
- Why are you lookin' at me?
- I'm looking at you

35:12.861 --> 35:13.693
because it was your ass

35:13.712 --> 35:15.162
having the conversation
with ashley.

35:15.197 --> 35:16.413
- Did you tell her
what I said?

35:16.465 --> 35:17.363
- I'm not having
the conversation.

35:17.382 --> 35:18.498
- That it was-- I said
that it was false,

35:18.533 --> 35:20.750
that we didn't believe
there was any fiber of truth.

35:20.803 --> 35:23.420
- Instead of you
coming to me as a woman,

35:23.472 --> 35:26.206
you decide to talk
to ashley,

35:26.225 --> 35:28.341
and so I'm putting
your ass on notice.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.426
- Mmm.

35:29.478 --> 35:31.061
- Because what you're
not going to do,

35:31.096 --> 35:32.562
let's be very clear,

35:32.598 --> 35:36.049
is you're not going to play
with my husband's name.

35:36.084 --> 35:37.767
Don't (bleep) with
my family.

35:39.988 --> 35:41.755
- Oh, (bleep).

35:41.790 --> 35:42.906
- And I'm saying it
to you kindly.

35:42.941 --> 35:44.524
- I don't care
if you say it meanly.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.775
It don't-- I don't give a sh--.
- It don't matter.

35:45.828 --> 35:46.776
You'll get your ass whipped.
- Talking to it.

35:46.829 --> 35:48.628
You-- oh, okay, wendy.
- Don't (bleep) with me.

35:48.664 --> 35:49.629
- I told this one,
and I'm telling you.

35:49.665 --> 35:51.198
- Remember that, and I'm
saying it to you kindly.

35:51.233 --> 35:53.066
- That I didn't believe it.

35:53.085 --> 35:54.901
If we sat there
and was like,

35:54.920 --> 35:56.903
"I wonder who the girl is,
and I wonder who this,

35:56.922 --> 35:57.787
and I wonder who that,"

35:57.840 --> 35:58.839
that's one thing.
- I'll be honest-- look.

35:58.874 --> 36:00.707
Look.
- We sat there
and immediately said,

36:00.742 --> 36:03.043
"this is not true."
the end!

36:03.078 --> 36:04.461
Why are you worked up?
- Let-let me very clear.

36:04.513 --> 36:08.632
- The blogs did and--
- gizelle, (bleep) these
mother----ing cameras

36:08.684 --> 36:09.766
because I'm telling you
very clearly.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.252
- I don't care, but-but
they're here, they're here.

36:12.271 --> 36:14.104
- When you talk
about my husband,

36:14.139 --> 36:15.272
you talk about me.
- Nobody--

36:15.307 --> 36:16.523
no one believes it, wendy!

36:16.558 --> 36:18.108
- It's not about it
being true.

36:18.143 --> 36:21.111
It's about you not
having any dignity

36:21.146 --> 36:22.495
to say--
- not true.

36:22.531 --> 36:24.114
- I'm gonna come
to you as a woman

36:24.149 --> 36:25.482
to have the conversation.

36:25.534 --> 36:27.100
- What was said
about eddie?

36:27.119 --> 36:28.318
- Don't worry.
If you wanna know,

36:28.370 --> 36:29.152
your friend
will tell you.

36:29.204 --> 36:30.654
- No, I wanna know from you.
You're--

36:30.706 --> 36:32.539
I wanna know what
you're receiving

36:32.574 --> 36:34.608
as them talking
about your husband.

36:34.643 --> 36:35.792
- Don't worry.
Don't worry.

36:35.827 --> 36:37.460
The messengers are
gonna tell you.

36:37.496 --> 36:39.613
- You came in saying,
"everyone in the group...

36:39.648 --> 36:40.664
- Stop talking to me.
Stop hogging the moment.

36:40.716 --> 36:41.748
- "I have an announcement
to make."

36:41.783 --> 36:43.583
and you won't say
what was said.

36:44.720 --> 36:46.286
- You want a moment so bad.
Girl, worry about you.

36:46.321 --> 36:47.354
- I don't need
a ----ing moment!

36:47.389 --> 36:48.505
Shut the (bleep) up!

36:49.491 --> 36:51.141
- Come on, y'all.
- (bleep) yourself, okay?

36:51.176 --> 36:52.425
- Oh, I will (bleep)
myself, okay?

36:52.461 --> 36:53.310
- (bleep) yourself
just like that

36:53.345 --> 36:55.395
wit' your whiskey breath.
- (bleep) you!

36:56.348 --> 36:58.014
- You don't even
have a relationship

36:58.066 --> 36:59.799
to even care about.

36:59.835 --> 37:00.800
You're talking crazy.
- Yes, she does.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.135
- Oh, I don't?
I don't? Okay.

37:02.170 --> 37:03.186
- She does.
- Girl, go to sleep.

37:03.238 --> 37:06.172
- You can't say she doesn't
have a relationship,

37:06.208 --> 37:07.540
but she does.

37:07.576 --> 37:08.525
- Eat a ----ing cracker

37:08.577 --> 37:09.676
'cause you've had
a lotta whiskey.

37:09.711 --> 37:11.344
Go to sleep.
- I don't give a (bleep).

37:11.380 --> 37:13.363
Y'all can say
what you want about him.

37:13.415 --> 37:15.031
I'm not gonna give it
this much energy

37:15.083 --> 37:16.750
and be so upset.

37:16.785 --> 37:18.818
Like, I'm so mad that
you talked about a blog.

37:18.854 --> 37:19.669
Oh, my god.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.588
Oh, oh, oh, a blog,
a blog, a blog.

37:21.623 --> 37:23.173
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.291
- Girl.
- Wendy, I-- I think

37:24.326 --> 37:27.344
because I don't take
those things seriously at all,

37:27.379 --> 37:28.845
especially if it was
brought to me

37:28.880 --> 37:30.397
the way I brought it to you,
it doesn't offend me,

37:30.432 --> 37:32.198
I am sorry that you
feel like I'm attacking

37:32.234 --> 37:33.383
you and your family

37:33.435 --> 37:35.385
when that really
wasn't my intention.

37:35.437 --> 37:36.303
- That was talking about
somebody's husband.

37:36.338 --> 37:38.138
- I don't know, ashley.
I don't know.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.522
If she brought it up
to you,

37:39.558 --> 37:40.540
she should have been the one
to bring it up her.

37:40.575 --> 37:41.641
- But she-- but she--

37:41.676 --> 37:44.527
- so, ashley and I
discussed it.

37:44.563 --> 37:47.013
It was just, hey, let's
just check on wendy.

37:47.049 --> 37:48.915
I said to you,

37:48.951 --> 37:50.951
maybe I'll discuss it
with you privately.

37:50.986 --> 37:53.403
- But she doesn't
understand the parameters

37:53.455 --> 37:54.621
regarding people's husbands

37:54.656 --> 37:56.122
because she doesn't
have a relationship

37:56.158 --> 37:58.208
that holds water.

37:58.243 --> 37:59.659
I see you for everything

37:59.694 --> 38:02.746
everybody ever said
that you were.

38:02.798 --> 38:03.930
- Thanks. Thanks.
- You proved everything

38:03.966 --> 38:05.081
everybody ever said
that you are.

38:05.133 --> 38:07.000
- It was not malicious.

38:07.035 --> 38:09.602
- What's so funny,
the life you're living now,

38:09.638 --> 38:11.371
is exactly god
paying you back

38:11.390 --> 38:13.206
for all the bullsh--
you've done.

38:14.276 --> 38:15.842
So, live in your
mother----ing truth.

38:15.877 --> 38:16.726
- What?
Wendy, what--

38:16.762 --> 38:17.510
- because god is paying
your ass back.

38:17.546 --> 38:19.112
- What are you
so upset about?

38:20.449 --> 38:22.949
- That's real sh--.

38:25.619 --> 38:26.870
- The life you're
living now,

38:26.905 --> 38:28.405
is exactly god
paying you back

38:28.457 --> 38:30.924
for all the bullsh--
you've done.

38:30.959 --> 38:32.625
So, live in your
mother----ing truth.

38:32.661 --> 38:33.526
- What? Wendy, what--

38:33.545 --> 38:34.294
- because god is paying
your ass back.

38:34.329 --> 38:35.412
- What are you
so upset about?

38:36.765 --> 38:38.865
- That's real sh--.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.467
You wanna fire shots,
there we go.

38:40.502 --> 38:42.502
I got the
mother----ing bazooka.

38:43.372 --> 38:46.006
I will drag you
up and down the street

38:46.041 --> 38:47.741
over my husband.
Don't play with me.

38:52.047 --> 38:53.179
- What the (bleep)?

38:53.215 --> 38:55.248
- What-what was said?
- Why would wendy

38:55.283 --> 38:57.934
put that into the universe
about her husband?

38:57.986 --> 39:00.236
[slurping]

39:00.272 --> 39:02.405
- gizelle is coming
after me

39:02.441 --> 39:05.091
because misery
loves company.

39:05.127 --> 39:08.361
Gizelle lacks empathy.
Gizelle lacks a man.

39:08.396 --> 39:11.498
Gizelle lacks bryant,
that's her middle name.

39:11.533 --> 39:13.366
- Everybody and their
grandmother has made up

39:13.401 --> 39:16.336
all kinds of bullsh--
about me.

39:16.371 --> 39:18.004
It's not true.
Keep it pushin'.

39:18.040 --> 39:20.073
- Move on.

39:20.108 --> 39:21.624
- If you want to go,
we can get it poppin'.

39:21.676 --> 39:23.576
- Wendy, the blogs write
sh-- all the time.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.779
- We can get it poppin'.
No, I knew jamal

39:25.814 --> 39:28.248
before I came on
this ----in' show.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.450
We're not talking about
blogs no more, baby girl.

39:30.485 --> 39:32.285
Imagine being with a man
that consistently

39:32.320 --> 39:33.787
cheats on you
all the time

39:33.822 --> 39:36.022
and sleeps around
all of baltimore,

39:36.058 --> 39:36.940
and everyone knows it,

39:36.975 --> 39:39.059
but you continuously
be with this person

39:39.094 --> 39:40.777
and think he's
worthy enough to bring him

39:40.812 --> 39:42.395
around your daughters.

39:42.430 --> 39:45.198
Like, you know how low of
a self-esteem you have to have?

39:45.233 --> 39:46.533
- What's she talking
about now?

39:46.568 --> 39:47.283
- Jamal.

39:47.319 --> 39:49.069
- I got facts.
- Okay. Oh, okay.

39:49.104 --> 39:50.036
- You see the difference?
- Okay.

39:50.072 --> 39:51.454
- Tread lightly.

39:54.843 --> 39:56.609
- All right.
- All right.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.178
- Sorry, I'll see y'all.

40:03.668 --> 40:06.286
[sighs]

40:06.321 --> 40:08.621
- that is not how
that was supposed to go.

40:08.657 --> 40:09.589
Just not.

40:09.624 --> 40:11.091
It really-- it really wasn't.
- What was--

40:11.126 --> 40:12.225
what was
your motivation for that?

40:12.260 --> 40:14.727
Like, especially
you of all people.

40:14.763 --> 40:16.096
- Do I look as though--
- why are you bringing that

40:16.131 --> 40:18.264
into the group?
- It's online.

40:18.299 --> 40:20.133
- Leave it online then.

40:20.152 --> 40:21.467
I have never brought
anything from

40:21.486 --> 40:22.802
a mother----ing blog
to you.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.571
- No, you've just fed sh--.
You just fed sh--.

40:24.606 --> 40:26.072
- But the fact that you would
bring that into the group...

40:26.108 --> 40:27.040
- You just fed it.
You just fed it.

40:27.075 --> 40:27.941
- ...Tells me what
I need to know about you.

40:27.976 --> 40:28.641
Take your milk and
get the (bleep) out.

40:28.660 --> 40:31.161
- For a long time.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.078
You feed it.

40:32.114 --> 40:34.647
You're the culprit.
You're the source.

40:34.683 --> 40:35.515
- Hi, everybody.

40:35.550 --> 40:37.083
Good night.
- Thank you, thank you.

40:37.119 --> 40:38.084
- Good night.
- Thank you so much.

40:38.120 --> 40:38.835
- All right, I'll see
you guys later, okay?

40:38.870 --> 40:40.036
- It was fun.
- Yeah.

40:40.088 --> 40:41.487
- Okay, bye, ashley.

40:41.506 --> 40:43.373
- Bye, thank you.
- Bye.

40:44.793 --> 40:47.293
- Girl, she is miserable.

40:47.328 --> 40:49.462
She's so miserable.

40:49.497 --> 40:51.848
- What is happening,
right now?

40:51.883 --> 40:52.849
- Oh, my god.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.434
- Like, you can't talk
about eating placenta.

40:54.469 --> 40:56.836
Clearly, you ain't eatin'
the (bleep) enough,

40:56.872 --> 40:58.671
miserable ass.
[laughing]

40:58.707 --> 41:00.690
- if gizelle would have
brought that to you directly,

41:00.725 --> 41:02.642
would you have had
that same reaction?

41:02.677 --> 41:04.477
- No.
- Why?

41:04.513 --> 41:07.180
- Because I would at least
try to give her some credit.

41:07.199 --> 41:08.348
- Girl.

41:08.383 --> 41:10.183
- So, why wouldn't she
come at-at eddie,

41:10.202 --> 41:12.452
who looks like
idris elba, honey,

41:12.487 --> 41:13.570
the same person
who she said

41:13.622 --> 41:15.288
that she would
(bleep) up and down?

41:17.626 --> 41:20.827
- I would have
very long sex with idris.

41:24.466 --> 41:26.332
- I mean,
I'm gonna ignore it.

41:28.670 --> 41:29.569
- Ha-ha.

41:29.604 --> 41:31.304
Girl, hello.
- Okay, this has gone left.

41:31.339 --> 41:32.255
Um...
- All right.

41:32.307 --> 41:33.239
So, let gizelle say
what she needs to say.

41:33.275 --> 41:34.007
Maybe she just hasn't
had the opportunity.

41:34.042 --> 41:34.891
- She don't need
to say sh-- to me

41:34.926 --> 41:36.893
because she doesn't
exist to me.

41:36.928 --> 41:37.710
- She does exist.
She's right hre on the sofa.

41:37.729 --> 41:38.811
- No, yeah.

41:38.847 --> 41:41.047
- It was nothing malicious.
I actually like eddie.

41:41.082 --> 41:42.482
- We all knew
about the blog.

41:42.517 --> 41:44.067
Every last one of us knew.

41:44.102 --> 41:45.652
Only one of us decided
to talk about it.

41:45.687 --> 41:47.487
- Yeah, what she says,
will trigger me,

41:47.522 --> 41:48.454
and I don't wanna
take it there

41:48.490 --> 41:50.273
because I have proven
that I have respect,

41:50.325 --> 41:51.608
and I was raised well.

41:51.660 --> 41:53.660
I'm not breaking bread
with that bitch-ass.

41:53.695 --> 41:55.328
Time to go.

41:57.949 --> 42:00.166
- Next time, on
"the real housewives
of potomac"...

42:00.202 --> 42:03.169
- I am honored
to present this token

42:03.205 --> 42:04.704
to miss karen huger.

42:04.739 --> 42:06.072
- All right.

42:06.091 --> 42:08.274
- I am very nervous
to be sworn in

42:08.310 --> 42:10.243
as the ambassador
to surrey county today.

42:10.262 --> 42:12.078
Thank you.

42:12.097 --> 42:13.930
- I would love for us
to talk whenever

42:13.965 --> 42:15.381
you wanna talk,

42:15.417 --> 42:16.783
not to your braids.
- The braid.

42:16.818 --> 42:18.801
- Just to wendy.

42:18.853 --> 42:21.354
- You have association
beef with wendy.

42:21.389 --> 42:22.255
- No, no, no, no.

42:22.274 --> 42:24.390
I know who is not
invited to my wedding.

42:24.426 --> 42:26.226
I know who is not invited
to a bridal shower.

42:26.261 --> 42:27.660
I know who is not
invited to sh--.

42:27.696 --> 42:31.998
- I need some extras
for my music video.

42:33.768 --> 42:34.934
[laughing]

42:34.970 --> 42:36.369
oh, my god!

42:36.404 --> 42:38.871
- Yes!
Yes, karen!

42:38.907 --> 42:40.607
- I love it!

42:40.642 --> 42:42.959
- She goes, "well, if you're
gonna be a weak bitch,

42:42.994 --> 42:44.160
then you don't
belong here."

42:44.212 --> 42:45.628
- she said, "a weak bitch?"

42:45.664 --> 42:47.247
- somethin' along
that line.

42:47.282 --> 42:48.648
- I would love for you
to explain to me

42:48.683 --> 42:50.283
why the moment
I left the house,

42:50.302 --> 42:52.802
you said,
"she's a weak bitch."

42:52.837 --> 42:54.170
- who said that?

42:54.222 --> 42:55.989
- You did.

42:57.008 --> 42:58.725
- Stop, mia!
