00:01.068 --> 00:02.634
- A woman like this,
a man has done something.

00:02.737 --> 00:05.938
- I'm not closed-off and shut
down. I'm just uninterested.

00:06.040 --> 00:08.207
- MALE NARRATOR: Previously
on "Sistas"...

00:08.309 --> 00:10.342
- Look, I know that you want
this to be your baby,

00:10.444 --> 00:13.746
but I swear to you, it's not.

00:13.848 --> 00:16.115
- If I hear anything
about what happened to you,

00:16.217 --> 00:19.051
this shit is gonna feel like
you went to a spa.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.753
- Gary is going to buy and buy,

00:20.855 --> 00:23.322
and I don't know what
the man's gonna buy me next.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.457
- Don't fall for it.
- Can you call Fatima?

00:25.559 --> 00:27.393
- I don't think
you want her to know this.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.795
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

00:31.332 --> 00:32.731
- Back child support?

00:32.833 --> 00:35.667
- Yes.
- How is this even possible?

00:35.770 --> 00:37.703
- She says you're
the father of her baby.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.071
- What?

00:39.173 --> 00:41.440
- He's three years old.
She's been trying to find you.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.476
- Oh, she's bugging!

00:44.578 --> 00:46.478
This is cap,
I don't even know this girl!

00:46.580 --> 00:49.248
- Well, she knows you.

00:49.350 --> 00:52.484
There's a picture
of the kid here.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.420
- What the -- ?

00:54.522 --> 00:56.455
- Jake, this is not my kid!

00:56.557 --> 00:59.291
- He look like you.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.394
- I swear to God,
I don't know this girl.

01:02.496 --> 01:07.933
- Her name's
Heather Lee Jennings.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.135
- I don't know nobody
by that country-ass name!

01:10.237 --> 01:11.837
- JAKE: Okay, okay.

01:11.939 --> 01:14.239
- Well, then, we need to ask
the judge for a paternity test.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.875
- Yes, that, we need to do.

01:16.977 --> 01:18.644
- Okay.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.413
I'm on that.

01:21.515 --> 01:24.516
- Whoa, wait, wait, what about
getting me out of here?

01:24.618 --> 01:26.518
- The judge wants you to pay
all the child support

01:26.620 --> 01:29.254
to get out.
- Oh, you bugging!

01:29.356 --> 01:31.390
- BILL: No.
- How much?

01:31.492 --> 01:32.891
- $37,000.

01:32.993 --> 01:35.194
- 37-

01:35.296 --> 01:36.862
How they come up
with that number?

01:36.964 --> 01:38.564
Nobody even called me!

01:38.666 --> 01:40.299
- It'll get you out of here.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.601
- [Zac gasping]
This is ridiculous!

01:42.703 --> 01:45.370
That's not my -- kid!

01:45.473 --> 01:47.906
- Okay, well,
until the judge knows that,

01:48.008 --> 01:50.275
you're gonna have to pay
in order to get out.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.244
- Look, Zac, just pay it,
we'll work it out.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.612
- Jake, you know damn well

01:53.714 --> 01:55.547
I'm not gonna get
my money back, bro!

01:55.649 --> 01:57.216
- JAKE: Either that
or you stay in here.

01:57.318 --> 02:00.552
- [Zac sighing]

02:00.654 --> 02:03.322
All right, all right.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.124
- Look, I'll help you
arrange it.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.592
- How? How?

02:06.694 --> 02:10.329
- We can ask the bank
to do a wire transfer.

02:10.431 --> 02:13.198
- Isn't it past four o'clock?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.367
- Yep.
- ZAC: So then we can't do that.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.403
- Then you'll have to stay here.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.772
- Some bullshit, bro.
That's not my kid!

02:20.875 --> 02:23.208
- Okay, but we're talking
about the system.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.444
- Will they take money orders?

02:25.546 --> 02:27.613
- Yeah, I think I can get
the clerk to do that.

02:27.715 --> 02:30.115
- Cool, all right we'll just get
you a couple of money orders.

02:30.217 --> 02:31.550
- Once again, how?

02:31.652 --> 02:34.286
All my cash is in the safe
in my girl's apartment.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.522
I'm the only one

05:54.788 --> 05:56.521
You're right.
- Yeah.

05:56.623 --> 06:00.692
Okay, well, I think you should
keep all of that shit.

06:03.397 --> 06:06.064
- And I felt like I knew
you were gonna say that.

06:06.166 --> 06:09.368
- Oh, yeah, you knew.
That's why you called me.

06:09.470 --> 06:13.238
- Well, I called you
for more than that.

06:13.340 --> 06:16.007
- Andi.
Andi, Andi, Andi.

06:16.110 --> 06:18.510
- Okay, you've always been
in the middle

06:18.612 --> 06:20.746
with the Gary situation.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.448
When all the girls
said leave him,

06:23.550 --> 06:27.519
you would say I should make
my own decision.

06:27.621 --> 06:32.290
So I just, I wanted to get
your honest opinion

06:32.393 --> 06:37.896
without the influence
of the crew.

06:37.998 --> 06:41.233
- Well, I think that
you still love him,

06:41.335 --> 06:46.738
that he still loves you,
and, um,

06:46.840 --> 06:49.841
it's gonna be the same old shit
until you get tired of it,

06:49.943 --> 06:54.479
and you're not tired of it yet.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.581
- Damn.

06:56.683 --> 06:59.317
- You know I'm right.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.453
- Yeah.

07:01.555 --> 07:04.589
- And, I mean, that --
spending that kind of money,

07:04.691 --> 07:06.491
at least we know he's in.

07:06.593 --> 07:10.028
- Mm, well, Karen thinks
he's spending that kind of money

07:10.130 --> 07:13.064
because of control,
and to control me.

07:13.167 --> 07:14.699
- Mm-hmm, Sabrina, too.

07:17.137 --> 07:20.906
- She said that?
- Oh, sure. Mm-hmm.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.575
- Wait, you guys were
talking about me?

07:23.677 --> 07:25.444
- Oh, we all do, yeah.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.612
We all talk about each other,
you know?

07:27.714 --> 07:31.049
- But, like, in a good way?
- In an honest way.

07:31.151 --> 07:35.587
- A good way?
- In an honest way.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.857
- Good honest?

07:38.959 --> 07:41.493
- The truth will set you free.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.061
- Okay.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.464
I think I know what that means.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.767
So do you think I should
be with him?

07:48.869 --> 07:50.502
- No, absolutely not, I don't.

07:50.604 --> 07:53.472
I don't think that.
Not at all.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.875
But I think you're gonna do
what you wanna do anyway,

07:56.977 --> 08:02.747
and, um, hey, whatever it takes
for you to get over him,

08:02.850 --> 08:04.616
you're gonna have to do, and...

08:08.188 --> 08:12.891
And sometimes that means
being with him.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.861
- Wow.

08:15.963 --> 08:18.263
That makes sense.

08:18.365 --> 08:22.133
- In its own twisted way.
You know, if you catch me

08:22.236 --> 08:24.269

and evening high,

08:59.239 --> 09:01.373

We're not together.

09:01.475 --> 09:03.308
- ANDI: You're not?
- We're not.

09:03.410 --> 09:06.311
You know, just taking
some time from it.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.380
Figure it out, get some optics.

09:08.482 --> 09:12.684
Just go.
- Speaking of optics,

09:12.786 --> 09:15.921
you wouldn't mind if
he saw other people?

09:26.266 --> 09:28.433
- Why does this keep happening?

09:28.535 --> 09:29.935
You know?

09:30.037 --> 09:32.604
How do they know where we are?

09:32.706 --> 09:36.374
- You know, we make them
take us to our favorite places.

09:36.476 --> 09:40.145
- Oh, he never took me anywhere,
but he's got this bitch here.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.447
- ANDI: No, I didn't know that.

09:42.549 --> 09:44.883

Let him.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.851
Let him have a good time.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.320
That's a pretty orange dress.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.722

Do you mean that?

09:50.824 --> 09:52.824

09:52.926 --> 09:54.292
