12:08.205 --> 12:11.033
Emma was, like,
my best friend.

12:11.077 --> 12:12.514
Emily.

12:12.557 --> 12:14.384
Well, Morgan's just strange.

12:14.428 --> 12:17.519
He's always rubbing his head
a lot and moaning...

12:17.562 --> 12:19.259
especially the other day.

12:19.302 --> 12:22.393
He seemed kind of paranoid,
looking around at everyone.

12:22.437 --> 12:26.135
And I think I saw him
arguing with his dummy.

12:26.179 --> 12:30.226
All I can think is:
"It could have been me."

12:30.270 --> 12:31.837
We can dream.

12:39.889 --> 12:43.457
Right now, you and me
gotta be on the lookout,

12:43.500 --> 12:45.807
figure out
who's gonna be next.

12:45.851 --> 12:48.288
How are we supposed to--

12:49.985 --> 12:51.945
MORGAN:
Hi.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.251
Hello.

12:55.296 --> 12:57.777
I was just working
on throwing my voice.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.822
Uh, Morgan, did you
notice anything weird

13:00.866 --> 13:02.302
going on around
here yesterday?

13:02.346 --> 13:05.914
Weird?
What do you mean?

13:05.958 --> 13:09.831
With Emily.
Did she say anything to you?

13:09.875 --> 13:11.791
Was she arguing
with anyone?

13:11.833 --> 13:15.229
No. She was dancing.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.230
Sid and I were talking.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.318
Talking?

13:18.361 --> 13:20.842
Rehearsing.

13:20.886 --> 13:23.498
So you didn't notice
anything weird that--

13:23.541 --> 13:24.846
Oh!

13:24.890 --> 13:27.197
Morgan, are you okay?

13:27.240 --> 13:29.677
Look, sweetheart,
he answered your question.

13:29.721 --> 13:31.505
Now leave him alone.

13:31.548 --> 13:34.248
Okay, Morgan, how about
talking to me yourself now?

13:34.290 --> 13:36.859
He said all
he's gonna say.

13:36.903 --> 13:40.514
It's okay, Sid.
We're done.

13:47.696 --> 13:51.351
I'm sorry. Look, I didn't
mean to make you mad.

13:51.394 --> 13:53.875
No. I'm--

13:53.919 --> 13:56.661
It's him.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.663
He's--

14:03.711 --> 14:05.105
We have to go.

14:07.933 --> 14:08.890
[door opens]

14:08.934 --> 14:10.500
Cute couple.

14:12.154 --> 14:14.722
Okay, next time we split up,
someone else is on Cordy detail.

14:14.765 --> 14:16.158
Five more minutes with her,

14:16.202 --> 14:17.725
and we would have had
another organ donor.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.075
WILLOW:
I think I had a bit more luck.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.380
Everyone I talked to
seemed

14:20.423 --> 14:22.600
to point their fingers
at the same person.

14:22.644 --> 14:23.993
Morgan?
Morgan.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.908
We have
a winner.

14:25.951 --> 14:28.083
I fear I was led
to the same conclusion.

14:28.128 --> 14:30.259
Well, what do we do?
We don't slay him, right?

14:30.303 --> 14:31.783
We want to bring him
to justice.

14:31.826 --> 14:33.873
We could set up a
complex sting operation

14:33.915 --> 14:35.351
where we get him
to confess.

14:35.395 --> 14:36.484
I should wear a wire.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.006
Whoa! Hey, you guys.

14:38.051 --> 14:40.966
All we know is that Morgan
is a grade "A" large weirdo.

14:41.009 --> 14:42.969
That doesn't lead
directly to murderer.

14:43.011 --> 14:44.971
Guy talks to his puppet.

14:45.014 --> 14:47.102
And for
his puppet.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.758
Well, yeah, but what about
the whole it's-a-demon theory?

14:49.801 --> 14:51.280
I'm looking into that,

14:51.325 --> 14:54.631
but, uh, my investigation
is somewhat hampered

14:54.676 --> 14:56.895
by a life in the theater.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.461
Uh, priority check,
Giles:

14:58.505 --> 15:01.029
talent show, murder.

15:01.073 --> 15:03.510
Yeah. We can't do
a talent show.
It's unthinkable.

15:03.553 --> 15:05.426
I'm not able to think it.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.254
Principal Snyder is watching
us all very closely.

15:07.297 --> 15:08.732
Now, if he chooses, he can make

15:08.777 --> 15:10.518
all our lives
extremely difficult.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.172
A-A slayer cannot
afford that.

15:12.215 --> 15:15.826
We will find this murderer,
but, in the meantime,

15:15.870 --> 15:18.394
the show must go on.

15:18.438 --> 15:20.179
This is so unfair.

15:20.222 --> 15:22.225
Buffy, you watch Morgan.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.096
Check his locker, see if
there's anything there.

15:24.139 --> 15:25.533
Like a heart?

15:26.447 --> 15:28.927
Or something.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.364
All right.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.105
I'll pull up
his locker number.

15:32.148 --> 15:34.455
W-- Can I still wear a wire?

15:55.432 --> 15:57.433
Okay.

15:57.477 --> 15:59.436
Two to the left...

15:59.480 --> 16:01.307
three to the right.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.236
[gasps]
Principal Snyder.

16:17.279 --> 16:19.195
What are you doing?

16:19.239 --> 16:20.413
Uh, looking for something.

16:20.456 --> 16:22.024
School hours are over.

16:22.067 --> 16:24.025
You, therefore,
should be gone.

16:24.070 --> 16:27.682
And I'm going
any minute now.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.205
There are things
I will not tolerate:

16:29.249 --> 16:31.816
students loitering
on campus after school,

16:31.860 --> 16:34.297
horrible murders with
hearts being removed,

16:34.341 --> 16:36.951
and also smoking.

16:36.995 --> 16:41.043
Well, I don't do any
of those things, not ever.

16:41.086 --> 16:44.046
There's something
going on with you.

16:44.090 --> 16:47.048
I'll figure it out
sooner or later.

16:48.963 --> 16:50.748
Do you need
something here?

16:50.792 --> 16:53.663
Oh. Yeah. Right.

16:53.707 --> 16:58.278
Um, a friend wanted me to get
something out of his case.

16:59.539 --> 17:01.932
[case opens]

17:06.981 --> 17:11.029
He must have taken it
and just forgotten to tell me.

17:12.596 --> 17:13.596
Mm-hmm.

17:16.644 --> 17:19.211
Get along home now.
It's late.

17:26.827 --> 17:28.612
No. I can't do it.

17:28.655 --> 17:31.180
It's the only way.

17:31.223 --> 17:32.268
I don't want--

17:32.311 --> 17:34.356
She's the one.

17:34.401 --> 17:35.792
But--

17:35.836 --> 17:39.231
You saw what she did,
how strong she is.

17:39.275 --> 17:40.493
I know, but--

17:40.537 --> 17:41.843
She's the last.

17:41.885 --> 17:45.586
Just this one more,
and I'll be free.

17:45.628 --> 17:46.586
I won't.

17:46.630 --> 17:47.631
I will.

17:49.807 --> 17:50.981
[knock on door]

17:52.941 --> 17:56.336
Hi, hon. How's it, uh, going
with the talent show?

17:56.378 --> 17:58.119
It'll be over soon.

17:58.163 --> 17:59.817
[scoffs]
It can't be that bad.

17:59.861 --> 18:02.298
I, for one, am looking forward
to seeing your act.

18:02.342 --> 18:07.086
Seeing? In the sense
of actually attending?

18:07.128 --> 18:08.130
Of course.

18:08.173 --> 18:09.696
Uh-uh, no, Mom. Y-You can't.

18:09.740 --> 18:12.394
I mean, if I know
you're out there watching,

18:12.439 --> 18:14.180
I'll freeze up, stage fright.

18:14.222 --> 18:16.095
But I want to support
what you're doing.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.227
Look, Mom, if you really love me

18:18.270 --> 18:20.229
and want to show your support,

18:20.272 --> 18:22.884
you'll stay away... far away.

18:24.406 --> 18:27.801
Honey, is there-- Is there
something bothering you?

18:29.064 --> 18:31.240
I-I mean besides
your fabulous debut?

18:31.284 --> 18:33.286
Nothing.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.203
There's just a lot
going on right now.

18:40.902 --> 18:44.210
Well, get some sleep.

18:44.252 --> 18:45.863
You'll feel better
in the morning.

18:45.906 --> 18:48.126
Good plan.

18:52.479 --> 18:55.089
Ooh.

19:07.363 --> 19:09.365
[creaking]

19:13.586 --> 19:15.588
[pattering]

19:24.075 --> 19:25.076
[screams]

19:26.990 --> 19:29.342
Honey, what is it?

19:29.384 --> 19:31.257
In the bed, in the covers,
there's something.

19:31.299 --> 19:33.214
Where?

19:34.346 --> 19:36.871
There's something there.

19:36.913 --> 19:38.915
Well-well, there's nothing there
now.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.354
Are you sure you didn't
have a nightmare?

19:41.396 --> 19:44.269
No! There's some--
There is--

19:44.313 --> 19:47.316
Ugh! Yeah.

19:47.359 --> 19:49.362
You're probably right.

19:49.404 --> 19:52.233
[sighs] I'm sorry
I got you up.

19:52.278 --> 19:55.890
Don't worry about it.
I was dreaming about bills.

19:57.934 --> 20:01.939
Sweetheart, you shouldn't go
to sleep with the window open.

20:07.030 --> 20:09.469
I didn't.

20:09.511 --> 20:13.864
And my lovely assistant
steps into the box.

20:20.914 --> 20:22.916
And...

20:22.960 --> 20:25.006
Behold.

20:25.048 --> 20:27.137
You were supposed
to leave.

20:27.182 --> 20:29.270
[laughter]

20:29.315 --> 20:31.317
I don't understand
why I--

20:31.359 --> 20:34.276
why I have to follow Brett
and his stupid band.

20:34.319 --> 20:36.931
Because we have to clear their
equipment before the finale.

20:36.973 --> 20:38.279
I told you.

20:38.324 --> 20:41.021
But the mood,
it'll be all wrong.

20:41.065 --> 20:45.330
My song is about dignity
and human feelings

20:45.374 --> 20:46.941
and personal...

20:46.983 --> 20:50.030
hygiene or something.

20:50.074 --> 20:51.423
Anyway, it's sappy.

20:51.467 --> 20:52.990
And no one is going
to be feeling sappy

20:53.034 --> 20:54.817
after all that rock and roll.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.432
[scoffs]
What?

21:00.476 --> 21:04.349
Oh, I'm sorry.
Um, your hair, uh--

21:04.393 --> 21:08.657
There's something
wrong with my hair?

21:08.701 --> 21:09.702
Oh, my God.

21:11.356 --> 21:14.097
Xander was right. It worked
like a charm. [chuckles]

21:17.405 --> 21:19.059
Hello.

21:19.103 --> 21:21.497
You're looking a bit
worse for, uh, oh--

21:21.540 --> 21:24.457
What exactly are you
the worse for?

21:24.500 --> 21:25.848
Where's Morgan?

21:25.893 --> 21:28.461
Uh, right. I haven't seen him.

21:28.503 --> 21:30.506
Did he do something to you?

21:30.549 --> 21:33.203
No, it was his--
Sid, the dummy.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.251
Okay, everyone look at me
like I'm in a bunny suit

21:37.296 --> 21:40.211
'cause that's how stupid
I feel saying this.

21:40.255 --> 21:42.736
I think Sid was
in my room last night.

21:42.778 --> 21:44.738
With Morgan?

21:44.780 --> 21:48.307
No, he was alone... and alive.

21:49.655 --> 21:50.830
Did you see him?

21:50.874 --> 21:51.832
Well, I saw something.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.136
It-it ran across my floor,

21:53.181 --> 21:54.574
under my bed,
and then it attacked me.

21:54.616 --> 21:56.402
Attacked you? How?

21:56.444 --> 21:58.403
It was like it
pounced on my face.

21:58.447 --> 22:00.144
Like a cat?Yeah, exactly.

22:00.188 --> 22:01.798
But when I turned the lights on,
it was already gone.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.233
I-I think it went out my window.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.497
Like a cat.

22:04.539 --> 22:05.498
Yeah-- no!

22:05.540 --> 22:07.500
It was Sid, the dummy.

22:07.542 --> 22:08.979
Or possibly the nightmare

22:09.022 --> 22:11.852
of somebody who had dummies
on her mind.

22:11.894 --> 22:14.157
You did say
they creep you out.

22:14.201 --> 22:16.769
Excuse me. Can I have a little
support here, please?

22:16.813 --> 22:19.685
I'm not just some crazy person.
I'm the slayer.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.426
The dummy slayer?

22:21.470 --> 22:23.777
There's nothing funny
about that.

22:23.819 --> 22:27.519
Well, on the side
of the Morgan's-
just-crazy theory,

22:27.563 --> 22:29.042
there is...

22:29.086 --> 22:31.261
well... Morgan.

22:33.829 --> 22:35.615
I'd like to see Morgan
without his better half

22:35.657 --> 22:36.615
for a few minutes.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.661
Bet he could tell me something.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.883
Oh, if it's
any consolation,

22:42.925 --> 22:45.580
I may have found
a possible demon culprit.

22:45.625 --> 22:47.365
There's-there's
a reference in here

22:47.409 --> 22:49.454
to a brotherhood
of seven demons

22:49.498 --> 22:51.847
who take, uh, the form
of young humans.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.022
Every seven years,

22:53.067 --> 22:54.851
these demons need human organs--

22:54.894 --> 22:57.854
a-a brain and a heart--
to maintain their humanity.

22:57.897 --> 23:00.814
Otherwise they-they revert back
to their original form,

23:00.856 --> 23:03.685
which is, uh,
slightly less appealing.

23:03.730 --> 23:07.472
WILLOW:
So Morgan could still
be the guy,

23:07.516 --> 23:10.911
only demon Morgan
instead of crazy Morgan.

23:10.953 --> 23:13.740
GILES:
It's said that
these demons

23:13.782 --> 23:15.523
are-are
preternaturally strong,

23:15.567 --> 23:18.179
a-a-and Morgan is--

23:18.221 --> 23:20.789
Well, he seems to be
getting weaker every day.

23:22.662 --> 23:25.664
It was as a result of this
that President Monroe

23:25.708 --> 23:28.406
put forth the eponymous--
meaning "named after oneself"--

23:28.450 --> 23:30.017
Monroe Doctrine,

23:30.059 --> 23:33.019
which, in one sense,
established the U.S.

23:33.063 --> 23:35.326
as a local peacekeeper...

24:04.268 --> 24:06.182
Looks like someone digs you.
That's adorable.

24:06.227 --> 24:09.751
You and the dummy could
tour in the freak show.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.016
Okay, who can tell me

24:13.059 --> 24:14.887
how Spain responded to
this policy?

24:14.931 --> 24:17.106
[Sid whispers]

24:17.151 --> 24:19.021
Morgan?

24:19.066 --> 24:20.153
Morgan?

24:20.196 --> 24:22.678
What?

24:22.721 --> 24:25.159
Morgan has other things
on his mind.

24:25.201 --> 24:27.377
[class laughs]

24:28.423 --> 24:29.555
Give me your puppet.

24:29.597 --> 24:32.339
I'll put him away.

24:32.383 --> 24:34.777
You'll get it back
after school.

24:40.608 --> 24:43.525
Okay, then, in the first part
of the 19th century--

24:43.568 --> 24:44.656
SID:
I'm still watching you.

24:44.700 --> 24:45.744
[laughter]

24:45.788 --> 24:48.703
Morgan, that is enough.

25:01.368 --> 25:02.326
Mrs. Jackson.

25:02.369 --> 25:03.326
Morgan.

25:03.371 --> 25:05.286
You said you'd give me--

25:05.328 --> 25:07.288
Oh, of course.

25:12.771 --> 25:14.512
You know,
I wanted to ask you,

25:14.556 --> 25:19.299
is everything okay
at home, here at school?

25:19.343 --> 25:20.866
Yeah, it's great.

25:20.910 --> 25:23.391
I feel like you've become
a little detached.

25:23.433 --> 25:25.132
Hmm?You're one of the
brightest kids

25:25.174 --> 25:26.828
I've seen in a long time,

25:26.873 --> 25:29.528
but lately it seems
like you're not all there.

25:31.050 --> 25:33.443
Try not to let other things
get in the way.

25:33.488 --> 25:36.577
Okay!
Can I get Sid now?

25:36.622 --> 25:38.144
Sure.

25:39.189 --> 25:41.191
[bell rings]

25:43.672 --> 25:45.281
It's gone.

25:45.326 --> 25:48.067
Gone?

25:48.111 --> 25:50.069
What do you mean "gone"?

25:50.113 --> 25:52.724
Where could he have gone?

25:52.768 --> 25:54.116
I put it right here.

25:54.161 --> 25:55.944
He knew to wait for me.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.424
He knew I'd be back.

25:57.468 --> 25:58.730
What do you mean "he"?

25:58.773 --> 26:01.080
What did you do with him?

26:01.124 --> 26:03.038
Where is he?

26:10.394 --> 26:11.526
[door opens]

26:15.835 --> 26:17.880
Where did you get that?

26:17.923 --> 26:20.970
Oh, I, uh, took it out
of Mrs. Jackson's cupboard.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.057
I thought you said
you wanted to be able

26:22.102 --> 26:23.190
to speak to Morgan alone.

26:23.232 --> 26:25.321
And, um, well, Morgan's alone

26:25.365 --> 26:27.324
and, uh, Sid's with me.

26:28.673 --> 26:31.067
[imitating Sid]:
Hi, Buffy. Hi, Willow.

26:31.111 --> 26:33.982
Would you like to hear
some off-color jokes?

26:34.027 --> 26:36.072
I really don't think you
should be doing that.

26:36.115 --> 26:37.638
What? Come on.

26:37.682 --> 26:39.509
I'm not real.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.382
Xander, quit it.

26:41.424 --> 26:43.384
[banging]

26:43.426 --> 26:44.819
He's not real.

26:47.910 --> 26:51.566
I think our demonstration
proves that, uh, Sid...

26:51.609 --> 26:53.394
is wood.

26:53.436 --> 26:55.395
Now, why don't you
go find Morgan

26:55.439 --> 26:58.398
and prove he's...
whatever he is.

26:58.442 --> 27:00.140
I imagine he's looking
for his puppet.

27:00.182 --> 27:02.358
I'll go find Morgan.

27:04.491 --> 27:06.102
You watch the dummy.

27:06.145 --> 27:07.190
[imitating Sid]:
Bye-bye now.

27:07.233 --> 27:08.278
I'm completely inanimate.

27:10.540 --> 27:14.153
Red rum!
Red rum!

27:14.196 --> 27:16.155
What do we do with him?

27:16.199 --> 27:19.288
Eh, I'll keep him company.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.074
Willow, we have some
hunting of our own to do.

27:21.116 --> 27:24.250
Once again, I'm banished
to the demon section

27:24.294 --> 27:26.078
of the card catalog.

27:30.648 --> 27:31.998
You concentrate
on reanimation theory.

27:32.040 --> 27:34.173
I'll peck about
in organ harvesting.

27:34.217 --> 27:35.522
Unless, of course,
you prefer--

27:35.566 --> 27:38.526
That's okay.
You can have the organs.

27:38.568 --> 27:41.660
So, I guess it's
just you and me, huh?

27:47.361 --> 27:48.971
That looks
more comfortable.

27:55.630 --> 27:56.979
BUFFY:
Morgan?

28:09.862 --> 28:10.992
Morgan?

28:42.328 --> 28:44.548
Principal Snyder.

28:44.592 --> 28:46.636
Looking for something?

28:46.681 --> 28:48.769
Have you seen
Morgan Shay?

28:48.814 --> 28:53.731
You know, with everything
that's been going on recently,

28:53.775 --> 28:58.258
I'm not sure how safe it is
for a girl like yourself

28:58.300 --> 29:01.347
to be here... alone.

29:01.391 --> 29:03.306
Well, I was just leaving.

29:03.349 --> 29:06.308
And I know how
to take care of myself.

29:09.877 --> 29:11.792
All right then.

29:27.766 --> 29:32.291
Look what I found
in the section
on toys and magic.

29:32.335 --> 29:34.816
"On rare occasions,
inanimate objects
of human quality,

29:34.859 --> 29:36.686
"such as dolls
and mannequins,

29:36.730 --> 29:38.645
"already mystically
possessed of consciousness,

29:38.689 --> 29:41.823
"have acted upon
their desire to become human

29:41.866 --> 29:44.826
by harvesting organs."

29:44.869 --> 29:45.871
Emily's heart.

29:45.913 --> 29:46.959
Morgan's dummy.

29:47.001 --> 29:48.525
Hmm.

30:12.897 --> 30:14.202
Whoa!

30:16.291 --> 30:18.207
What is it?

30:18.250 --> 30:20.339
He's gone.
Sid's gone.

30:20.383 --> 30:22.384
What? Oh!
[gasps]

30:39.228 --> 30:41.796
[creaking]

30:41.839 --> 30:44.232
Morgan?

31:11.565 --> 31:13.522
Morgan.

31:20.269 --> 31:22.923
Demon's got himself a brain.

31:26.405 --> 31:27.711
[clattering][gasps]

31:39.635 --> 31:41.682
[groans]

31:52.213 --> 31:53.519
[rapid pattering]

31:54.738 --> 31:56.784
[grunting]

32:03.616 --> 32:05.967
Who's ever out there,
I'm gonna hurt you!

32:06.010 --> 32:07.098
Badly!

32:07.142 --> 32:09.928
If you'll just give me a minute.

32:16.412 --> 32:17.805
Aah!

32:18.545 --> 32:19.938
[grunts]

32:25.508 --> 32:27.423
[footfalls approaching]

32:27.989 --> 32:29.295
Aah!

32:32.689 --> 32:34.386
You win.

32:34.430 --> 32:37.999
Now you can take your heart
and your brain and move on.

32:38.042 --> 32:39.260
I'm sure
they would have made

32:39.305 --> 32:40.522
great trophies
for your case.

32:40.567 --> 32:43.265
That would've
been justice.

32:43.308 --> 32:44.570
Yeah, except
for one thing:

32:44.614 --> 32:47.529
you lost and now
you'll never be human.

32:47.574 --> 32:51.359
Yeah, well,
neither will you.

32:54.058 --> 32:55.711
What?
What?

32:55.756 --> 32:58.324
SID: This is what I do.
I hunt demons.

32:58.366 --> 33:01.935
Yeah. You wouldn't know it
to look at me.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.242
Let's just say there was me,

33:04.286 --> 33:06.809
there was a really mean demon,

33:06.854 --> 33:08.682
there was a curse,

33:08.724 --> 33:11.597
and the next thing I know,
I'm not me anymore.

33:11.641 --> 33:14.165
I'm sitting on some guy's knee

33:14.209 --> 33:16.777
with his hand up my shirt.

33:16.819 --> 33:19.910
And ever since then
you've been a living dummy?

33:19.953 --> 33:22.042
The kid here
was right all along.

33:22.086 --> 33:24.740
I should've picked you to team
up with, but I didn't because--

33:24.785 --> 33:27.221
Because you thought
I was the demon.

33:27.266 --> 33:28.832
Who can blame me for thinking?

33:28.875 --> 33:31.443
Look at you.
You're strong,

33:31.487 --> 33:33.271
athletic...

33:33.315 --> 33:35.535
limber...

33:35.577 --> 33:37.624
nubile.

33:40.234 --> 33:42.193
I'm back.

33:42.237 --> 33:43.717
[kettle whistling]In any case,

33:43.759 --> 33:46.111
now that this demon's
got the heart and brain,

33:46.153 --> 33:49.983
he gets to keep the human form
he's in for another seven years.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.333
Well, I say
it's a welcome change to have

33:51.376 --> 33:53.117
someone else explain
all these things.

33:53.161 --> 33:55.990
There were seven of these guys.
I've killed six.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.425
If I can get the last one,

33:57.470 --> 33:59.863
the curse will be lifted
and I'll be free.

33:59.906 --> 34:02.213
I'm sure it's someone
in that stupid talent show.

34:02.257 --> 34:04.085
Yeah, but now the demon
has what he wants.

34:04.128 --> 34:05.565
He'll be moving on.

34:05.607 --> 34:08.001
So once we know who's
missing from the show--

34:08.045 --> 34:10.047
We'll know who our demon is.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.570
The show!What?

34:11.614 --> 34:13.876
It's going to start.
I'm supposed to be there.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.750
Okay, um, start pulling
everyone's addresses
in the talent show.

34:16.793 --> 34:19.012
I-If they're not there,
maybe we can catch them at home.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.753
SID:
And you get 'em
all onstage.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.364
Form the power circle.

34:22.407 --> 34:24.277
Then we can see
who's a no-show.

34:24.322 --> 34:25.628
Um, th-the what?

34:25.672 --> 34:27.195
The power circle.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.545
You get everyone together,
you get 'em, you know,

34:29.588 --> 34:30.719
revved up.

34:30.764 --> 34:32.244
Right.

34:34.985 --> 34:37.465
How'd he ever get that gig?

34:37.510 --> 34:39.947
15 minutes to curtain, everyone.

34:39.989 --> 34:42.775
Now, 15 minutes.

34:42.818 --> 34:45.387
I, I can't go out there.

34:45.431 --> 34:46.909
All those people
staring at me

34:46.954 --> 34:51.088
and judging me like
I'm some kind of... Buffy.

34:51.132 --> 34:53.003
What if I mess up?

34:53.047 --> 34:56.920
Cordelia, the, uh, th-there's
a-an adage that, uh,

34:56.963 --> 34:58.922
if you're feeling nervous,
then, uh, you should imagine

34:58.965 --> 35:01.099
the entire audience
are in their underwear.

35:01.141 --> 35:02.751
Ew!

35:02.795 --> 35:05.494
Even Mrs. Franklin?
Ugh!

35:05.538 --> 35:07.974
Perhaps not.
Um, all right.

35:08.018 --> 35:10.498
Um, we'll assemble
on the stage in five minutes

35:10.543 --> 35:12.719
for the, um, uh, power thing.

35:14.547 --> 35:15.809
So what's your deal, kid?

35:15.851 --> 35:19.246
I don't figure you
for a demon hunter.

35:19.291 --> 35:20.639
I'm a vampire slayer.

35:20.682 --> 35:22.815
You?
You're the slayer?

35:23.947 --> 35:26.036
Damn.

35:26.079 --> 35:28.561
I knew a slayer in the '30s.

35:28.603 --> 35:31.954
Korean chick. Very hot.

35:31.998 --> 35:33.782
We're talking
muscle tone.

35:33.827 --> 35:36.221
Man, we had some times.

35:38.961 --> 35:41.530
Hey, that was
pre-dummy, all right?

35:41.574 --> 35:43.619
I was a guy.

35:46.318 --> 35:50.277
So you kill the demon and
the curse is lifted, right?

35:50.322 --> 35:52.324
That's the drill.

35:52.367 --> 35:54.717
You don't actually turn
into a prince, do you?

35:54.760 --> 35:56.501
I-I mean, your body--

35:56.545 --> 35:59.199
Is dust and bones.

35:59.244 --> 36:00.766
When I say free--

36:00.809 --> 36:02.072
You mean dead.

36:02.115 --> 36:04.422
Don't get sniffly on me, sis.

36:04.465 --> 36:07.947
I've lived a lot longer
than most demon hunters.

36:07.990 --> 36:09.644
Or slayers,
for that matter.

36:09.688 --> 36:13.735
Of course, if you want
to snuggle up and comfort me--

36:13.780 --> 36:17.827
So that horny dummy thing
really isn't an act, is it?

36:17.871 --> 36:18.871
Nope!

36:18.914 --> 36:20.047
Yuck.

36:20.090 --> 36:21.353
GILES:
Is everybody here?

36:21.396 --> 36:23.485
I think so.

36:23.528 --> 36:26.226
Okay, here comes
our lineup.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.228
Quickly, everyone, uh...

36:28.273 --> 36:30.405
Um, power circle.

36:30.449 --> 36:34.539
[indistinct chatter]

36:40.284 --> 36:41.807
Oh. That's that then.

36:41.851 --> 36:44.070
Um, everybody, uh... get ready.

36:44.114 --> 36:45.376
BOY:
That's it?

36:45.420 --> 36:47.248
GIRL:
That was quick.
All right.

36:47.291 --> 36:48.858
[overlapping chatter]

36:53.123 --> 36:54.298
Hold on.

36:58.302 --> 37:00.260
No one's missing.

37:00.304 --> 37:01.697
So the demon
isn't in the show?

37:01.740 --> 37:03.481
It seems not.
Uh, tell the others.

37:03.525 --> 37:05.527
It's nearly curtain.
I must get the show running.

37:05.570 --> 37:07.572
Right.
Right.

37:10.445 --> 37:12.012
Sid?

37:37.603 --> 37:39.822
Sid?

37:49.527 --> 37:51.572
Oh! Aah!

37:57.536 --> 38:00.103
I'm never gonna stop
washing my hands.

38:00.146 --> 38:02.192
XANDER:
So the dummy tells us
that he's a demon hunter,

38:02.235 --> 38:04.978
and we're like,
fine, la-la-la-la.

38:05.021 --> 38:06.893
He takes off,
and now there's a brain.

38:06.936 --> 38:08.286
Does anybody else feel

38:08.329 --> 38:09.590
like they've been
Keyser Soze'd?

38:09.635 --> 38:11.157
Sid's on the level,
I'm sure of it,

38:11.201 --> 38:13.202
but why would the demon
have rejected the brain?

38:13.246 --> 38:16.076
I mean, I thought Morgan was
the smartest kid in school.

38:16.119 --> 38:19.340
He was. Look at
his grades: all As.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.864
He was even taking
college classes.

38:21.907 --> 38:22.735
Wait a second.

38:22.777 --> 38:23.822
What?

38:23.865 --> 38:25.346
All these sick days.

38:25.389 --> 38:27.000
He was out for,
like, half the year.

38:27.043 --> 38:29.045
Check the school nurse's file.

38:29.088 --> 38:31.744
[typing]

38:31.786 --> 38:33.353
Look at this.

38:33.398 --> 38:36.356
"In case of emergency,
contact Dr. Dale Leggett,

38:36.400 --> 38:40.143
California Institute
of Neurosurgery, Cancer Ward."

38:40.186 --> 38:41.840
Brain cancer?

38:41.884 --> 38:43.755
That's why he had
all the headaches.

38:43.798 --> 38:45.235
This means
that whatever's out there

38:45.278 --> 38:46.672
still needs
a healthy, intelligent brain.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.369
In other words,
I'm safe. [chuckles]

38:48.413 --> 38:52.112
And it's going to be looking
for the smartest person around.

38:53.286 --> 38:54.853
What?

38:54.896 --> 38:56.856
Yes, if y-you calibrated
the units of weight,

38:56.898 --> 38:59.989
then you could calculate the,
uh, specific maximum velocity

39:00.032 --> 39:01.947
achieved before the
point of impact.

39:01.990 --> 39:03.775
Gee, Mr. Giles,
you're really smart.

39:03.818 --> 39:05.038
Could you do me a favor?

39:05.081 --> 39:08.041
What could a demon
possibly want from me?

39:08.083 --> 39:10.085
What's the square root
of 841?

39:10.130 --> 39:11.958
29.

39:12.001 --> 39:13.829
Oh, yeah.
Don't worry, Willow.

39:13.873 --> 39:15.788
As long as you're with us,
there's absolutely no way

39:15.831 --> 39:17.920
that demon is going
to get what he wants.

39:21.315 --> 39:22.708
Oh, my.

39:22.751 --> 39:24.753
Pretty cool, huh?

39:27.539 --> 39:30.018
Are you sure there's no one else
who could help you out?

39:30.063 --> 39:31.498
My assistant got sick.

39:31.543 --> 39:32.673
You won't have
to say anything.

39:32.717 --> 39:34.327
I'll show you.
Lie down.

39:34.371 --> 39:36.764
Uh, how-how exactly
does it work?

39:36.809 --> 39:39.027
A good magician
never tells his secrets.

39:43.467 --> 39:45.164
Come on.
We haven't got much time.

39:45.208 --> 39:46.949
This is ridiculous!

39:46.992 --> 39:49.561
We can't just sit here
and wait for him to come to us.

39:49.603 --> 39:51.083
We have to figure out
who we're dealing with.

39:51.126 --> 39:52.911
I still vote dummy.

39:52.954 --> 39:56.916
No! Okay, so we ruled out all
the people in the talent show.

39:56.958 --> 39:58.307
That's because
they were all there,

39:58.351 --> 40:00.920
but that's before
we found the brain.

40:00.963 --> 40:03.574
Right. So it probably
is one of them,

40:03.617 --> 40:05.577
and-and Giles doesn't know it.

40:05.619 --> 40:07.447
He's with them all
right now!

40:07.492 --> 40:11.409
And Giles can handle himself.
I mean, he is really...

40:12.800 --> 40:15.021
Smart.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.545
Giles!

40:22.855 --> 40:24.769
Sh-Sh-Shouldn't it be
aimed at my neck?

40:24.813 --> 40:29.427
No. No, this way your
scalp gets sliced off,

40:29.469 --> 40:32.385
and your brains just
come pouring out.

40:33.342 --> 40:36.128
What exactly is the trick?

40:36.172 --> 40:37.956
Trick?

40:38.000 --> 40:40.001
Marc?

40:47.009 --> 40:48.880
M-Marc?

40:50.360 --> 40:51.405
Oh.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.409
[Buffy grunts]

40:57.106 --> 40:58.456
[both grunting]

41:01.545 --> 41:03.938
[demonic growl]

41:03.983 --> 41:05.331
Ew!

41:05.375 --> 41:06.594
Ooh!

41:10.032 --> 41:12.251
Aah!

41:20.172 --> 41:20.739
[grunts]

41:21.956 --> 41:23.175
Where are the keys?

41:23.219 --> 41:24.829
Marc's got it.

41:24.873 --> 41:26.222
Willow!

41:29.007 --> 41:30.269
Hurry!

41:35.710 --> 41:36.318
[grunts]

41:42.847 --> 41:44.065
How do you
lock this thing?

41:44.110 --> 41:45.414
[growling]

41:45.458 --> 41:46.503
[gasps]

41:52.030 --> 41:53.032
What's happening?

41:55.121 --> 41:56.208
[screaming]

41:56.251 --> 41:57.601
[growling]

42:03.608 --> 42:05.565
SID:
I found you!

42:06.740 --> 42:08.221
[Sid grunting]

42:16.838 --> 42:17.577
[growling]

42:17.621 --> 42:18.623
Let go!

42:21.016 --> 42:22.626
[chop]

42:22.670 --> 42:24.541
[panting]

42:28.240 --> 42:30.722
Uh...

42:30.764 --> 42:33.376
I must say, all of you,

42:33.420 --> 42:36.117
your t-timing is impeccable.

42:36.161 --> 42:38.947
SID:
And now for the big finish.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.949
What are you doing?

42:40.992 --> 42:43.603
It's not enough.

42:43.648 --> 42:46.302
He'll come back.

42:46.346 --> 42:48.695
You have to get
the heart.

42:48.739 --> 42:51.568
Then all of this
will be over.

42:51.612 --> 42:53.483
Let me.

42:53.527 --> 42:55.398
I got it.

42:55.442 --> 42:58.097
Thanks.
[grunts]

42:58.139 --> 43:00.577
[demonic yell]

43:03.101 --> 43:05.146
[grunts]

43:28.257 --> 43:30.041
It's over.

43:30.085 --> 43:31.085
[curtain pulls back]

43:33.914 --> 43:35.873
[audience murmuring]

43:47.146 --> 43:49.844
I don't get it.

43:49.887 --> 43:52.934
What is it, avant-garde?

43:56.458 --> 43:58.983
O ruler of my country,
Oedipus, you see

43:59.027 --> 44:00.507
our company around the altar,

44:00.550 --> 44:02.509
and I, the Priest of Zeus.

44:02.552 --> 44:04.728
Ha, ha! They prophesize
that I should kill
my father,

44:04.771 --> 44:07.514
but he is dead
and hidden deep
in the soil.

44:07.556 --> 44:10.516
But surely I must fear
my mother's bed.

44:10.559 --> 44:12.954
O Oedipus, Oedipus,
unhappy Oedipus.

44:12.998 --> 44:15.000
That is all
I can call you

44:15.043 --> 44:17.045
and all that I ever
shall call you.

44:17.088 --> 44:19.873
Darkness,
and horror of darkness,

44:19.918 --> 44:21.963
unfolding, restless
visitant

44:22.007 --> 44:23.922
sped by an ill wind
in haste.

44:23.965 --> 44:25.532
Madness and...

44:25.574 --> 44:28.708
madness a-and
stabbing pain

44:28.753 --> 44:31.494
and-and-- uh, oh--

44:32.974 --> 44:35.019
Oh...

44:35.063 --> 44:38.893
Memory of, uh,
ill deeds I have done.

44:43.942 --> 44:45.943
[laughter]

44:47.989 --> 44:50.688
Grr. Argh.
