00:13.747 --> 00:15.549
Hey there.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.285
I'm not a photographer,

00:17.318 --> 00:20.754
but I can totally picture
you and me together.

00:20.788 --> 00:24.592
Funny, my fiancé says
the exact same thing.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.295
Lucky guy.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.797
Lucky girl.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.472
Please say you'll be here soon.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.308
MAN:
What are you doing here, man?

00:41.775 --> 00:44.245
Nick?

00:44.278 --> 00:46.180
Nick?

00:49.217 --> 00:51.752
What's going on

00:53.887 --> 00:56.624
Nick, what's happening?
Where are you? Nick!

00:56.657 --> 00:57.658
Pick him up.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.864
Come on, baby. Pick up. Please.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.100
Hey, this is Nick.
You got the dreaded voicemail.

01:06.134 --> 01:09.337
Leave a message.
Nick, it's me. Where are you?

01:09.370 --> 01:11.472
What's going on? Call me back.

01:11.505 --> 01:14.508
Please. Call me back.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.486
What the hell?

01:25.519 --> 01:28.256
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:28.289 --> 01:30.691
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:30.724 --> 01:33.361
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:33.394 --> 01:34.362
* How, how, how, how

01:34.395 --> 01:36.430
* Hey, hey

01:42.603 --> 01:44.071
* You gotta come on.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.778
Sure could use my Mr. Woobie
right now.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.513
Your Mr. What?
You know, Woobie.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.415
It's the night light
shaped like a turtle.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.783
Projects stars on the ceiling.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.918
* Someone's afraid
of the dark *

01:57.951 --> 02:00.154
I am not.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.522
Here it is.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.394
Oh.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.861
God, watch my head, dummy.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.397
Oh, sorry.
Gosh.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.798
PRIDE: You two find
the transfer switch?

02:10.831 --> 02:12.533
Working on it!
Working on it!

02:12.566 --> 02:16.204
All right. A, B, C, D.
Here we go.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.406
We got it!

02:18.439 --> 02:20.408
Who is "we," Kemosabe?

02:20.441 --> 02:22.410
NEWS ANCHOR: According
to the mayor's office,

02:22.443 --> 02:24.412
the citywide blackout
plaguing New Orleans

02:24.445 --> 02:26.314
began at the 12th Street
Substation

02:26.347 --> 02:29.317
and is believed to be connected
to construction work at the...

02:29.350 --> 02:32.320
Let there be light!
Yes.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.821
Or not.

02:33.854 --> 02:36.424
Damn backup
generator.

02:36.457 --> 02:39.427
100 bucks to anyone
who can get that thing

02:39.460 --> 02:41.295
up and runnin' for good.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.297
Bring it.
Oh, I brought it.

02:43.331 --> 02:46.200
Go for it, guys.
Any word on the outages?

02:46.234 --> 02:48.702
Most likely canal work hit
a snag. Shut down the grid.
Yeah, well,

02:48.736 --> 02:51.572
just a matter of time before all
that construction wreaked havoc.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.508
Ask me, it's the people of the
city that are wreaking havoc.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.211
A buddy from NOPD says
they're flooded with calls.

02:57.245 --> 02:57.878
WOMAN:
Mr. Dwayne.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.582
Frankie. What is it, honey?

03:01.615 --> 03:02.983
I didn't know where else to go.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.885
It's okay.
No, it isn't.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.487
It's Nick.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.289
I think he's in trouble.

03:09.657 --> 03:13.594
Okay. Let's start
at the beginning,

03:13.627 --> 03:15.463
when the call came in.

03:15.496 --> 03:19.500
Yeah. I could hear him,
but he couldn't hear me.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.001
You know, like a pocket dial.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.770
And you heard yelling?

03:22.803 --> 03:24.638
It sounded
super intense.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.607
There was shouting
and some kind of struggle.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.277
Okay. And then the phone call
ended.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.479
I kept trying to call him back,
but I couldn't get through.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.947
Well, that doesn't
necessarily mean anything.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.617
Cell phone towers are jammed
from the blackout.

03:36.650 --> 03:40.354
No, I know. But it's just weird
he hasn't called back.

03:40.388 --> 03:42.490
You said there was arguing.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.492
Was Nick supposed
to meet anyone?

03:44.525 --> 03:47.661
No. He was supposed to meet me
after his shift ended on base.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.631
Said he had a surprise.

03:50.664 --> 03:53.033
Nick called. It came in at when?

03:53.066 --> 03:55.002
Maybe 6:45?

03:56.069 --> 03:58.372
My phone's dead.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.541
Oh, yeah? Let me see.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.510
I was so panicked.
I didn't know what to do.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.513
Coming here,
you did exactly the right thing.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.847
Here you go.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.585
There's no reception.

04:11.619 --> 04:14.855
Give it a sec.
Towers are overloaded.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.924
Oh, my God, he called.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.926
There you go.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.396
: Frankie, it's me.

04:22.430 --> 04:25.599
If I don't make it, just know

04:25.633 --> 04:28.436
I was trying
to give you everything.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.671
I love you.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.541
If he doesn't make it?

04:33.574 --> 04:35.576
What does that mean?

04:38.479 --> 04:40.881
Doesn't mean
anything yet.

04:40.914 --> 04:43.484
Let us do our work.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.920
Okay? And you just stay
right here.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.759
We're looking for
a Petty Officer Nick Benton.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.761
Recruiter assigned
at Belle Chasse.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.964
And engaged to Frankie.
She also happens to be

04:56.997 --> 04:58.432
one of my daughter's
oldest friends.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.501
And according to Frankie,

05:00.534 --> 05:01.902
Nick was
last heard from

05:01.935 --> 05:04.438
shortly after the blackout.
That puts us
at

05:04.472 --> 05:05.639
just over two hours.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.575
Power outages,
base is following

05:07.608 --> 05:09.710
strict security protocol.
We won't be able to get on.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.912
Left word for Nick's
C.O. to get here ASAP.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.582
Filed a missing person's report
with NOPD. Backlogged.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.650
Fusion center's a mess, too.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.586
Imagine the entire city's
overwhelmed.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.621
Best thing
you can do right now...

05:21.655 --> 05:23.524
...get that generator up
and running.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.726
I'm on it, King. And not because
I want to beat the pants off

05:25.759 --> 05:28.596
of Percy.
BRODY:
Laurel and Frankie are close?

05:28.629 --> 05:29.863
Since second grade.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.865
Thick as thieves those two.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.635
Kind of young
to be engaged, yeah?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.036
She's a good kid.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.472
Had a tough upbringing.

05:38.506 --> 05:42.743
Mom, Camilla,
strong lady.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.478
Struggled financially.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.747
Died a few years ago.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.616
BRODY:
Her father?

05:48.649 --> 05:50.618
Never knew him.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.620
So she's on her own.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.922
Till Nick.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.624
Three years ago.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.626
At the Navy Birthday Ball.

05:58.659 --> 06:01.695
I brought Frankie and
Laurel as my plus-two.

06:01.729 --> 06:05.032
Soon as Nick asked her to
dance, she just lit up.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.034
Been together ever since.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.802
Best thing that ever
happened to her.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.539
Patton's got something.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.408
PATTON:
So, I lift the voicemail
off your girl's phone,

06:14.442 --> 06:17.411
trying to isolate where
her fiancé made the phone call,

06:17.445 --> 06:18.846
get my ping on.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.848
Network's
a mess.
Oh.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.184
It's like Bloody Mary's
booze cruise on a Sunday.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.521
The Internet is down,
the towers is jammed.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.723
Town's
a damn technological wasteland.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.725
But never fear,

06:31.759 --> 06:34.428
Triple P's nothing
if not adaptable.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.096
Watch and learn something,
sister.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.670
I was trying
to give you everything.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.572
I love you.
Wait. Hold on.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.740
Doesn't end there.
The message goes on.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.144
Car wheels.
Driving over something.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.813
Listen to the intervals.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.584
It's consistent. Like a pattern.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.819
Wheels rolling
over expansion joints.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.955
Bridge?
There's a ton of 'em
in Jefferson Parish.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.992
Listen to this.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.829
Train.
It's close.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.231
Only bridge in Jefferson Parish
with railroad tracks...

07:11.264 --> 07:12.633
Huey P. Long.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.134
LASALLE:
Keep those headlights burnin'.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.848
It's him.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.983
Nick.

07:30.017 --> 07:33.587
Contact JPSO, Loretta,

07:33.621 --> 07:35.856
and his command.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.858
And notifying next of kin?

07:37.891 --> 07:40.828
That's a call I got
to make myself.

07:42.029 --> 07:46.233
Night just got
a whole lot darker.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.582
Contacted JPSO and JP Morgue.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.250
Traffic lights are out.
It'll take Wade at least

08:03.283 --> 08:04.251
an hour to get here.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.853
Meantime,

08:05.886 --> 08:07.487
we got a head wound.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.592
Forehead,
just above the left eye.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.994
So, uh,

08:14.027 --> 08:15.295
what we know,

08:15.328 --> 08:18.131
Frankie got a pocket dial,

08:18.165 --> 08:21.134
heard Nick fighting.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.638
Left this message
before he died.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.641
Wallet was still intact.
Nothing was stolen.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.177
That's not entirely true.
Shoes are missing.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.582
Now, who do we think might need
a pair of shoes?

08:39.920 --> 08:41.655
SONJA:
Check that out, Lasalle.

08:41.689 --> 08:44.191
Now, that's
a serious fashion don't.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.629
LASALLE:
Hey, pal.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.298
NCIS.

09:01.108 --> 09:01.909
Stop!

09:07.981 --> 09:09.583
Turn over. All right.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.585
Easy, buddy.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.720
Easy.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.624
Oh, yeah. We got to talk.

09:19.392 --> 09:23.363
You do this
for a pair of shoes, Mickey?

09:26.266 --> 09:29.870
He was already like that
when I found him.

09:29.903 --> 09:33.140
If you didn't kill him,
why are you covered in blood?

09:35.408 --> 09:36.877
Hmm?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.679
I tried to help him.

09:38.712 --> 09:39.947
No, it's not safe.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.282
It's not. No. Shh! Shh.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.952
No.
What's not safe?

09:44.985 --> 09:48.956
The monster.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.324
They always come out
in the dark.

09:53.661 --> 09:56.096
So a monster did this

09:56.129 --> 09:57.765
to Petty Officer Benton?

09:57.798 --> 09:59.700
Dragged him down to the water.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.401
I wanted to help.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.837
By stealing his shoes?
No.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.639
No, he would've wanted me
to have them.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.776
Mickey...
maybe you're the monster.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.744
No! No!

10:10.778 --> 10:12.112
No, I would never do that.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.647
I would never hurt anyone!

10:13.681 --> 10:15.382
Hey, it's okay.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.750
Hey, hey, hey.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.952
Tell us about this monster.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.026
He was big.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.930
And, uh... hulking.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.766
O-Okay, okay.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.402
Uh, with wrinkly skin.

10:35.435 --> 10:36.937
Pen and paper.
Okay.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.773
Want a pen
and paper.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.745
Navy S.O.

10:44.778 --> 10:48.148
Nick started calling me that
after we got engaged.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.883
Significant other.

10:49.917 --> 10:53.754
I never thought
I'd be that girl.

10:53.787 --> 10:57.691
One with the ring
on her finger.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.927
He wanted a big wedding.

11:01.094 --> 11:04.364
All the bells
and whistles.

11:04.397 --> 11:08.368
Fancy tablecloths,
five-piece band.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.905
I fought him on it
tooth and freakin' nail.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.810
Told him we should
just go down to city hall.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.313
Figured wedding's are
for family.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.217
I kept thinking
about the church.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.452
His side full,

11:25.485 --> 11:27.821
mine practically empty.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.792
My mom's gone.

11:31.825 --> 11:34.995
No dad to walk me
down the aisle.

11:36.764 --> 11:40.100
Thought about asking you.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.469
I would've been honored.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.210
PRIDE:
Appreciate

11:50.243 --> 11:52.112
you coming back in the
middle of the night, Loretta.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.747
Ah, considering
who the victim is.

11:53.781 --> 11:56.149
Poor Francesca.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.151
I'd imagine
Laurel's a wreck.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.353
Yeah, she's in Houston
visiting her mother.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.891
Hopping a flight as soon
as the airport opens back up.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.492
Any leads?

12:05.525 --> 12:08.361
Homeless guy, but I...
I don't think he's good for it.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.230
Dark soul, but not a killer.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.232
Mind the candles.
Generator's keeping

12:12.265 --> 12:14.367
the drawers cold.

12:14.401 --> 12:19.272
So, in conducting my autopsy
on Petty Officer Benton,

12:19.306 --> 12:22.509
I've concluded that the cause
of death was a subdural

12:22.542 --> 12:26.113
hematoma, caused by blunt force
trauma to the head.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.116
Petty Officer Benton also
suffered severe lacerations

12:29.149 --> 12:30.450
of the forehead.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.286
Poor Nick.
Based on the

12:33.320 --> 12:35.455
shape and diameter
of the contusions,

12:35.488 --> 12:38.558
I suspect the weapon was
a heavy metal instrument

12:38.591 --> 12:41.394
with a sharp edge.

12:41.428 --> 12:46.299
The weapon also left this
imbedded in the tissue.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.935
Appears to be

12:47.968 --> 12:49.469
metallic fiber.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.138
Sebastian doing his thing?

12:51.171 --> 12:54.174
Yeah. Beware the head lamp.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.883
Sebastian?

13:02.916 --> 13:03.884
Oh, hey.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.552
Uh...

13:05.585 --> 13:07.888
Light's kind of intense
here, buddy.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.890
Oh, right. Sorry.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.892
What do got going on in here?

13:11.925 --> 13:14.461
Oh, you know, blackout's got me
flexing the old imagination.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.163
I've been recreating
the mine cart chase

13:16.196 --> 13:17.597
from the end of Temple of Doom.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.567
Did you know that the
cave formations' rock

13:20.600 --> 13:23.336
in those movies were just
tin foil spray

13:23.370 --> 13:25.572
I did not.
Yeah, the magic
of movie-making.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.341
Yeah. How about the magic
of crime solving?
Oh.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.244
Even better. So, uh,
these are the fibers

13:31.278 --> 13:33.246
pulled from your
victim's head wound.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.215
The EDS detector's
still down, so...

13:35.248 --> 13:36.984
all hail magnets.

13:37.017 --> 13:40.387
The non-magnetic flakes--
those are aluminum.

13:40.420 --> 13:44.324
And judging by the tint,
these are probably steel.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.625
But I'm not gonna lie.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.260
All this old-school
chem lab stuff--

13:47.294 --> 13:48.929
it's really getting
my juices flowing.

13:48.962 --> 13:52.599
Steel?
Yeah, uh, just,
uh, basic grade.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.869
Found in electric
motors, transformers,

13:55.903 --> 13:57.470
inductors, headphones,

13:57.504 --> 13:59.472
printers, scanners,
coaxial cables,

13:59.506 --> 14:01.274
dishwashers,
refrigerators, you know.

14:01.308 --> 14:04.411
So, basically...
everything.
Yeah. Determining

14:04.444 --> 14:06.947
the exact aluminum alloy would
help narrow it down a bit.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.481
But with the blackout,

14:08.515 --> 14:10.117
I can't even power up
the XRF Spectrometer.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.952
Okay, okay, so,
why don't you let me know

14:11.985 --> 14:13.887
when you find out
something.
You got it.

14:13.921 --> 14:17.390
And, hey, to get out, you
must take the left tunnel!

14:19.392 --> 14:21.962
Oh!
Smooth move, Indy.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.497
Hey! Aah!

14:24.531 --> 14:29.269
Pride needs to scrap
this piece of junk.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.638
Just call me Ms. Woobie.

14:31.671 --> 14:35.976
Mr. Woobie belonged
to my brother Cade.

14:36.009 --> 14:39.012
He'd keep it in my room 'cause
he didn't want people to know

14:39.046 --> 14:40.680
he was afraid of the dark.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.319
He'd come into my room
when the lights went out,

14:46.353 --> 14:48.388
count the stars on the ceiling.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.523
Nice.
Yeah.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.994
Now if you don't get
this generator up and running,

14:54.027 --> 14:57.064
that C-note Pride promised
is gonna be mine.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.531
Yeah, we shall see, Percy.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.200
We shall.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.003
Don't suppose you had any luck
with Mickey?

15:03.036 --> 15:07.407
Oh, well, only if our killer's
a genetically-mutated frog.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.410
It's no frog. Gargoyle.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.613
There's only one place
in the city to find him.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.056
SONJA:
Whoever heard
of a blackout party?

15:23.090 --> 15:25.025
You know, the lights go off,

15:25.058 --> 15:26.693
and people act
like it's end of days.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.695
Excuse me, sir.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.297
At least
they're having a good time.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.965
Okay.

15:31.999 --> 15:35.635
Yeah, it looks
nice on you.
Ugh.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.605
*

15:38.638 --> 15:41.174
Looks like the monster
was in uniform.

15:41.208 --> 15:44.577
Y'all need anything?

15:44.611 --> 15:48.481
Yeah. Can I get, uh, some mace
and a Zombie apocalypse kit?

15:48.515 --> 15:52.052
NCIS.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.121
Ever seen this guy?

15:55.422 --> 15:58.258
I know him.
Came by here last week.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.193
He and Dex got into it.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.995
SONJA:
Who's Dex?
MAN: Declan Shane.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.496
One of the bouncers here.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.765
Now define "got into it."

16:05.798 --> 16:07.500
WOMAN:
Arguing. Shoving.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.502
MAN:
He's in the middle
there with the beard.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.204
Dex threw the guy out.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.206
We'd like to talk
to this Dex.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.675
So would we.
Blew his whole shift off.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.644
Never showed up tonight.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.748
LASALLE:
Declan Shane has
a long record.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.551
According to N.O.P.D,
he's been in and out

16:24.584 --> 16:26.086
of Orleans Parish Prison

16:26.119 --> 16:28.555
for burglary, carjacking
and armed robbery.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.223
You name it,
the guy's stolen it.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.092
We've got
the search warrant.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.627
Guy's around
the corner.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.130
NCIS!

16:42.135 --> 16:43.103
PRIDE:
Clear.
BRODY:
Clear.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.404
We're clear back here.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.577
Declan's been busy.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.747
Pride, you got to see this!

16:56.849 --> 16:59.652
What the hell am I looking at?

16:59.686 --> 17:02.455
Maps of the city's
electrical grids.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.792
Avondale 12th Street substation.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.394
It's where
the blackout started.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.129
BRODY:
Guys?

17:09.162 --> 17:11.331
Murder weapon.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.334
PRIDE:
Heavy metal, sharp edges.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.735
So, it's possible...

17:15.768 --> 17:17.804
Nick's murder is connected

17:17.837 --> 17:20.740
to the mother
of all blackouts.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.854
City's been through
more than its share.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.324
Blackouts, floods, storms.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.759
Sometimes it brings out
the worst.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.462
But then, just when

17:42.495 --> 17:44.864
you think you've figured out
how it's all gonna go,

17:44.897 --> 17:47.334
a stranger brings
your cat back to you

17:47.367 --> 17:49.469
three months
after the storm.

17:49.502 --> 17:53.540
Then stays to help fix
your busted-up roof.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.108
That's new Orleans.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.477
Doesn't take electricity
to light it up.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.612
You're Agent Pride, right?
Yes, sir.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.348
Bart Johnson,
lead on the job.

18:01.381 --> 18:02.882
Hey, Bart, know you're busy.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.884
Understatement. Just when
we get power back up

18:04.917 --> 18:06.519
in Marigny and Bywater,

18:06.553 --> 18:08.621
lose it in Central City
and the Garden District.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.890
Well, we have questions
about the blackout.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.559
About time someone does.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.794
This was not an accident.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.896
Somebody cut the gate
over there.
Saw that.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.698
Did a hatchet job
on the cables.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.167
Oh, ballsy.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.901
Bastards
were smart.

18:21.934 --> 18:25.372
Avoided the security cams,
had all the right gear.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.407
Industrial cutters,
just like those.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.508
SONJA:
Pride?

18:28.541 --> 18:30.177
Look familiar?

18:30.210 --> 18:31.511
PRIDE:
Murder weapon
did double duty.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.513
Those easy to come by?

18:33.546 --> 18:37.250
Yeah, sure.
Real key, though-- these.

18:37.284 --> 18:40.153
Puppies carry 13,000 volts per.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.654
Go near 'em unprotected,

18:41.688 --> 18:43.656
fry yourself like a damn
green tomato.
Yeah.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.725
Fibers look like the ones

18:45.758 --> 18:50.663
Loretta took
from Nick's head wound.
Yeah.

18:50.697 --> 18:53.533
Cutting these cables caused
the entire city do go dark?
Nah.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.868
Station only powers
one square on the map.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.704
Damage caused
a cascade failure.

18:57.737 --> 19:01.274
Station got overloaded, rest
of the grid fell like dominoes.

19:01.308 --> 19:05.212
So, whoever did this was
targeting one specific area.

19:06.313 --> 19:09.282
What were they after?

19:09.316 --> 19:11.551
Streetcar roundhouse,
shipping dock,

19:11.584 --> 19:13.286
some bars and music joints.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.556
And one high-secured warehouse
that happened to get broken into

19:16.589 --> 19:18.191
shortly after the blackout.

19:18.225 --> 19:20.227
Bonded warehouse, actually.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.561
Our space caters
to high-profile,

19:21.594 --> 19:23.563
high-end collectors--
anything from art,

19:23.596 --> 19:25.565
antiquities, cars,

19:25.598 --> 19:26.966
fine wines.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.302
Oh, it's a shmancy
warehouse.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.903
What type of security
do you employ?

19:30.937 --> 19:32.839
Only the most
cutting edge.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.441
3-D cameras,
retina scanners,

19:34.474 --> 19:35.775
heat-sensing
biometrics.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.777
All things that failed
during the blackout.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.847
Looks like the thieves
bucked your system.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.882
Here's the unit.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.584
Yesterday, there was close

19:44.617 --> 19:46.386
to two million
in antique furniture.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.755
Wow.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.725
Must've been a sweet
set of La-Z-Boys.

19:52.759 --> 19:55.895
A rare and highly sought after

19:55.928 --> 19:59.732
19th-century French Revival
library collection.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.601
We're gonna need
info on the owners.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.936
An inventory
of everything taken.

20:03.970 --> 20:07.274
Not sure
we can accommodate that.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.509
Privacy is our hallmark.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.711
Solving a murder is ours.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.647
I will get you
that contact information.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.449
Thank you.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.920
Techs found
some tire tracks outside.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.489
Got some soil residue.

20:22.522 --> 20:23.890
Thinkin' it was a big truck.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.658
Well, that makes sense,

20:25.692 --> 20:28.495
given the size vehicle
needed to clean this out.

20:28.528 --> 20:31.431
Gonna get them to pull
prints off the door.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.633
Probably gonna be
the owners of the unit.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.936
Or Mr. It's-A-Shmancy-Warehouse.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.372
Get everything to Sebastian.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.040
We'll get you the info
on the owners.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.809
Grab Brody. Pay them a visit.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.378
You got it.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.680
MAN: Dad spent half his life
collecting those pieces.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.682
It's okay, honey.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.418
My husband passed
away recently.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.685
Lung cancer.

20:52.719 --> 20:53.820
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.789
Gordon made his fortune
in real estate,

20:56.823 --> 20:59.659
but his real passion
was rare antiques.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.060
Collection was Dad's legacy.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.695
Meant the world to him.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.697
Is there any chance we'll
get some of it back?

21:04.731 --> 21:06.799
That's not really
our jurisdiction.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.402
So, then, why are you here?

21:09.436 --> 21:10.803
Trying to figure out
how the robbery

21:10.837 --> 21:12.071
ties in with a murder.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.307
This petty officer was killed.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.944
Doesn't look familiar.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.446
Mom?

21:21.113 --> 21:22.482
No.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.851
How about this guy?

21:26.986 --> 21:29.322
That's Dex.

21:29.356 --> 21:30.690
He's a bouncer
at The Gargoyle,

21:30.723 --> 21:32.325
the club I promote at.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.328
And how well do you know him?

21:35.362 --> 21:36.896
Not well.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.031
Grabbed the occasional beer,
talked about girls, sports.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.833
You guys ever talk about family?

21:40.867 --> 21:43.503
It's hard to say,

21:43.536 --> 21:45.772
but when
you're Gordon Fontaine's son,

21:45.805 --> 21:47.840
it's not exactly easy
to keep a low profile.

21:47.874 --> 21:51.511
Our family goes back
five generations in this city.

21:51.544 --> 21:52.879
We're gonna need
elimination prints from you

21:52.912 --> 21:54.347
and anyone else who might've

21:54.381 --> 21:55.848
come in contact
with the furniture.

21:55.882 --> 21:58.751
Anything we can
do to help.

21:58.785 --> 22:01.721
Okay. Tell me things.
Well, assuming
our thief is Declan,

22:01.754 --> 22:03.356
he cased the
Fontaine family

22:03.390 --> 22:05.024
by cozying up
to the son, Toby.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.726
Orchestrates a blackout

22:06.759 --> 22:08.027
to dismantle warehouse security.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.729
Pulls the heist,
goes on the run.

22:09.762 --> 22:10.997
Yeah, but for the murder
or the blackout?

22:11.030 --> 22:13.400
Likely both.
The question remains,

22:13.433 --> 22:15.067
what does Nick Benton
have to do with it?

22:15.101 --> 22:17.069
That's where Triple P comes in.

22:17.103 --> 22:19.406
Your girl Frankie dropped
off her man's laptop.

22:19.439 --> 22:22.742
I took a fine-tooth comb
to the hard drive.
Did you get anything?

22:22.775 --> 22:25.645
In addition to some of
my mojo back... plenty.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.882
Thanks to my own hot spot
during the blackout,

22:29.916 --> 22:31.083
came up with this.

22:31.117 --> 22:33.052
Looks like
young Nick's developed

22:33.085 --> 22:35.522
an interest in the "good life."

22:35.555 --> 22:38.024
Over a dozen searches
on the Fontaine family

22:38.057 --> 22:39.892
this past month alone.

22:39.926 --> 22:43.029
Also, links to
the Sotheby's catalogue

22:43.062 --> 22:47.767
and a slew of Web sites about
old-time Frenchy furniture.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.836
So Frankie's fiancé could've
been in on the heist.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.838
According to his C.O.,
Nick did two years

22:51.871 --> 22:53.440
rebuilding infrastructure
in Baghdad.

22:53.473 --> 22:54.774
Would've known
his way around

22:54.807 --> 22:56.108
electrical wiring
pretty good,

22:56.142 --> 22:57.844
helped orchestrate
the blackout.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.111
This case is going

22:59.145 --> 23:00.847
all kind of Ocean's Eleven now.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.849
So, what...
Nick and Declan are partners?

23:02.882 --> 23:04.651
Declan gets greedy,

23:04.684 --> 23:05.918
doesn't want to split the take?

23:05.952 --> 23:07.920
Just hold on, everyone.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.522
Look, I've spent time with Nick.

23:09.556 --> 23:10.990
He's been to my house.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.992
But he's gotta be
connected somehow.

23:14.694 --> 23:15.828
Sebastian.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.930
He's got a lead
on the dirt samples

23:17.964 --> 23:19.732
from the tire tracks
at the warehouse.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.934
Oil residue and seashells.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.102
Offshore oil rigs?

23:23.135 --> 23:24.136
Drill shipyards.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.838
There's about six of 'em

23:25.872 --> 23:27.139
within driving distance
of the city.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.709
What are you waiting for?

23:29.742 --> 23:31.844
We gone.

23:31.878 --> 23:33.946
A heist? This is insane.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.882
Nick wouldn't steal a pack
of gum from a gas station.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.717
Just trying
to make sense of it all.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.752
You mentioned he had
a surprise for you?

23:39.786 --> 23:40.853
I meant
like a deal

23:40.887 --> 23:43.690
on a honeymoon package,
not a felony.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.558
Look, I don't know who
this Declan Shane is,

23:45.592 --> 23:46.893
I don't know about
any furniture,

23:46.926 --> 23:48.227
and I've never heard
of the Fontaines.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.831
But Nick was smart,

23:51.864 --> 23:53.900
funny and loyal as hell.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.035
I agree with you.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.904
But we're missing
something, here.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.109
On the voice mail...

24:03.142 --> 24:04.644
Nick said he wanted
to give you

24:04.677 --> 24:07.113
everything you never had.

24:07.146 --> 24:11.918
Now, I know you and
your mom had your struggles...

24:11.951 --> 24:13.986
Nick and I didn't
care about money.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.488
Things.

24:15.522 --> 24:16.989
We had each other.

24:17.023 --> 24:20.860
Frankie... help me out, here.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.995
Can you explain any of this?

24:23.029 --> 24:25.031
Isn't that your job?

24:29.769 --> 24:31.037
Numero seis.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.507
Please tell us
this is the one.

24:34.541 --> 24:37.276
Looks like this might
be your lucky day.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.912
That's a big enough truck to
hold a crap load of furniture.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.764
Declan Shane.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.966
No honor
among thieves.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.635
Check out
those gloves.

25:02.669 --> 25:03.803
Check the back.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.050
Clear.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.118
Clear.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.620
Clear.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.090
Ladies, take a look at this.

25:26.993 --> 25:30.062
Who steals $2 million
of old furniture...

25:30.096 --> 25:32.164
...just to destroy it?

25:44.877 --> 25:46.178
RADIO HOST:
To all you battery-operated,

25:46.212 --> 25:49.115
candle-burning New Orleanians
out there, enjoy the daylight,

25:49.148 --> 25:52.719
because darkness
is right around the corner.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.320
Fill me in, Christopher.

25:54.353 --> 25:56.856
On the generator front,
had no luck.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.257
On the case front?

25:58.290 --> 26:00.126
Brody and Percy
are cataloguing

26:00.159 --> 26:01.594
what we found
in the truck.

26:01.628 --> 26:02.995
So far, we got this.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.931
Along with Declan
Shane's body,

26:04.964 --> 26:06.733
there's a boatload of
smashed furniture,

26:06.766 --> 26:08.200
a pair of thermal
gloves...

26:08.234 --> 26:10.136
To go along
with the bolt cutters

26:10.169 --> 26:12.038
recovered at Declan's house.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.641
Likely used to cut the wires
at the substation.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.943
Not to mention consistent

26:16.976 --> 26:18.778
with the weapon
that killed Nick.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.312
But we're still short.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.882
Need to know

26:22.915 --> 26:25.885
who put that bullet
in Declan Shane.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.654
Well, I looked
into the truck.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.356
Registered to a man
named Manny Indonato.

26:30.389 --> 26:33.292
Vehicle registration
lists an address

26:33.325 --> 26:34.761
in Metairie.

26:34.794 --> 26:37.697
So... three man job.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.365
Things go south.

26:39.398 --> 26:41.033
One of the guys, Manny,

26:41.067 --> 26:43.369
decides to get rid
of the others?

26:43.402 --> 26:45.071
Over what, the haul?

26:45.104 --> 26:47.206
Nah, nah... loot was moot.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.641
I scoured
the black market.

26:48.675 --> 26:50.309
Not one piece
of ancient-ass furniture

26:50.342 --> 26:52.645
was offered up
in the last 36 hours.

26:52.679 --> 26:53.913
Well, how'd you get your intel?

26:53.946 --> 26:57.216
Oh, I had to go
all Doobie Brothers on this one.

26:57.249 --> 26:59.085
Take it to the streets, baby.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.654
Nose to the grindstone,
ears to the wall.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.690
Bottom line, your suspects

27:03.723 --> 27:05.992
weren't ever hawking any wares.

27:06.025 --> 27:08.094
None of it makes sense.

27:10.429 --> 27:11.664
Loretta and Sebastian.

27:11.698 --> 27:13.700
All right, I got this.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.134
You two stay hot
on the truck owner.

27:15.167 --> 27:19.939
Let me know if Sonja and
Brody turn up anything.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.207
WADE:
...small caliber
bullet was found

27:21.240 --> 27:22.675
in Mr. Shane's
right temple,

27:22.709 --> 27:25.144
and the lack of
defensive wounds

27:25.177 --> 27:27.413
or powder burns
around the entry

27:27.446 --> 27:30.082
suggest the victim was
shot at close range.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.685
Likely knew his killer.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.220
Seems that way.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.822
What do you got, Sebastian?

27:35.855 --> 27:37.289
Fingerprints, Holmes...

27:38.257 --> 27:40.827
As in Sherlock Holmes.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.829
That didn't really sound right
at all. Uh, I've been, uh,

27:42.862 --> 27:46.232
dusting, printing,
logging, comparing...

27:46.265 --> 27:48.367
You know, there used to be
a whole art form to this,

27:48.400 --> 27:49.368
back in the day.

27:49.401 --> 27:52.104
With the automated
fingerprint ID system down...

27:52.138 --> 27:54.841
How about more show
and less tell, dear?

27:54.874 --> 27:56.108
Okay, right, sorry.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.376
So I got prints from the truck,

27:57.409 --> 27:58.778
prints from the furniture...

27:58.811 --> 28:00.179
I even managed
to get prints

28:00.212 --> 28:01.914
from the inside of
the thermal gloves.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.750
Compared them to the prints
we got off of Declan Shane.

28:03.783 --> 28:06.052
All perfect matches
except for one:

28:06.085 --> 28:07.787
the prints
from the bolt cutters.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.756
Which I was able to confirm

28:09.789 --> 28:12.725
was the weapon used to kill
Petty Officer Benton.

28:12.759 --> 28:15.127
Right. So you take
Declan Shane's prints

28:15.161 --> 28:17.163
and you compare them...

28:20.767 --> 28:22.902
Not the same.

28:24.937 --> 28:27.740
So Declan was
wearing gloves

28:27.774 --> 28:29.308
when he cut the wires
at the substation,

28:29.341 --> 28:31.043
causing the blackout.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.812
Yeah, but someone else must have
handled the murder weapon

28:32.845 --> 28:34.914
with their bare hands.

28:34.947 --> 28:37.283
Must've been
our third man.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.218
Oh, Third Man.
Orson Welles?

28:39.251 --> 28:41.220
Film noir at its best.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.489
It's great. This guy goes
back to his old hometown,

28:43.522 --> 28:45.758
only to find that his
old buddy is dead,

28:45.792 --> 28:47.960
so he starts concocting
this kooky theory

28:47.994 --> 28:49.962
that maybe there's
a third guy involved.

28:49.996 --> 28:51.831
The whole thing is
scored with a zither...

28:51.864 --> 28:54.200
BRODY:
This is intriguing.

28:54.233 --> 28:57.036
"Louis XV, also known
as the Scoundrel King,

28:57.069 --> 28:59.839
hid countless mistresses
at the Parc-aux-Cerfs."

28:59.872 --> 29:01.774
Damn, Louis was a player.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.776
Like the Secretary de Pompadour,

29:03.810 --> 29:05.477
named after Madame Pompadour,

29:05.511 --> 29:07.814
one of Louis'
frequent companions

29:07.847 --> 29:10.082
was configured with
a secret compartment

29:10.116 --> 29:12.184
hidden by a double wall.

29:12.218 --> 29:16.455
Secretary's a frou-frou name
for a desk, right?

29:16.488 --> 29:18.757
Look at this.

29:38.845 --> 29:40.046
It's hollow.

29:40.079 --> 29:42.548
Hang on, I saw something like
this on Antiques Roadshow.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.394
Jackpot.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.533
Manny Indonato, the guy that
owns the truck, alibied out.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.970
So no third man?

30:04.003 --> 30:05.404
Nope.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.975
Think we figured out
what our thieves were after.

30:09.008 --> 30:11.310
Found these letters
hidden in the furniture.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.378
Listen to this.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.146
"My darling G,

30:14.180 --> 30:15.581
"the baby's
getting so big.

30:15.614 --> 30:18.117
Her smile
reminds me of you."

30:18.150 --> 30:19.385
G?

30:19.418 --> 30:21.888
Gordon... Fontaine.

30:23.089 --> 30:24.556
Wait a sec.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.559
Is that...?

30:32.164 --> 30:34.000
Frankie.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.601
Fontaine is her father.

30:35.634 --> 30:38.170
Which means she is
one of his legal heirs.

30:38.204 --> 30:41.407
I can think of someone who'd
have a major problem with that.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.876
Toby Fontaine.

30:43.910 --> 30:46.012
Found our
third man.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.020
Can I help you?

30:54.053 --> 30:55.254
You've already done
more than enough.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.469
NOPD went by
Fontaine's house,

31:10.502 --> 31:12.471
checked the club--
no sign of Toby.

31:12.504 --> 31:15.474
So if he's not here,
he's in the wind.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.476
You two take the back.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.211
Sonja with me.

31:34.426 --> 31:35.594
PRIDE:
Got signs of a struggle.

31:35.627 --> 31:36.662
Here we go.

31:39.365 --> 31:41.934
Three, two, one.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.635
NCIS, we're coming in!

31:57.249 --> 31:58.684
Clear.

32:03.555 --> 32:05.124
Clear.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.309
Stay back!

32:23.342 --> 32:25.677
Uh, Toby.
TOBY: Stay
the hell back.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.679
Toby...
Tell the other agents
to get behind you.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.715
Stay back!
All right, all right.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.650
PRIDE: Easy, easy.
Get 'em behind you.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.252
Come on.
They're coming.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.521
Move! Is that all of them?
That's it.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.023
Easy, take
it easy.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.524
"Take it easy"?
Stay back, all right?

32:38.557 --> 32:40.159
Toby.
Stay...

32:40.192 --> 32:42.394
I'm calm and collected,
so you just stay back.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.695
Okay, all right, all
right, what do you want?

32:43.729 --> 32:45.197
I want to get out the back
of this house. Stay back.

32:45.231 --> 32:46.999
Frankie, easy.

32:47.033 --> 32:49.001
Toby, you don't need
to take Frankie.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.136
Stay back!

32:50.169 --> 32:51.303
Just let Frankie go.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.406
Don't move, all right?

32:54.440 --> 32:56.008
I'm serious, I'm getting
out of here right now with her.

32:56.042 --> 32:58.010
You stay on that porch!
Stay on the porch!

32:58.044 --> 33:00.312
Okay, it's okay, it's all right.

33:00.346 --> 33:02.081
Toby, look at me.
Look at me, Toby.
No.

33:02.114 --> 33:04.050
Toby, hang on a second.
Just wait.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.592
I'll take that.

33:16.362 --> 33:17.596
PRIDE:
Okay.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.700
BRODY: Love letters,
want to read?

33:21.733 --> 33:24.703
Look, some sailor
shows up at the club,

33:24.736 --> 33:27.173
says he's tracking
his fiancée's birth father.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.508
Thinks she's
my half sister.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.511
Says her mother used
to leave love notes

33:32.544 --> 33:35.781
for my dad in his library.

33:35.814 --> 33:37.716
But I know what
he was really after.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.551
Money.

33:40.819 --> 33:43.789
But it takes a lot more
than a couple letters

33:43.822 --> 33:46.592
to earn your keep with good
old Gordo Fontaine.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.627
Lot of expectations, huh?

33:50.129 --> 33:53.099
Can see how it seems unfair.

33:53.132 --> 33:56.602
Some stranger comes in and takes
what's rightfully yours.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.604
Some bastard my dad
didn't even know about.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.339
Ah, your father
knew about her.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.274
Kept these photos and letters

34:02.308 --> 34:05.277
locked away for safe keeping
all those years.

34:05.311 --> 34:08.280
Treasured them.

34:08.314 --> 34:12.118
You hired Declan Shane
to rig the blackout,

34:12.151 --> 34:15.387
break into the warehouse
and make these go away.

34:15.421 --> 34:17.623
But Nick was determined.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.625
So when he followed you
to the sub station,

34:19.658 --> 34:22.661
you killed him and dumped
his body under the bridge.

34:22.694 --> 34:25.664
Ooh, nice theory.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.240
SONJA: Elimination
prints you gave us--

34:34.273 --> 34:35.741
dead match.

34:37.343 --> 34:39.645
No longer just a theory.

34:43.349 --> 34:46.452
PRIDE:
Miss Fontaine,

34:46.485 --> 34:48.154
we could use
some help here.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.588
Where did you get these?

34:49.621 --> 34:51.590
You knew about them?

34:51.623 --> 34:54.426
Not the letters.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.463
The... the affair.

35:00.466 --> 35:03.569
Camilla worked for
us as a housekeeper.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.538
Gordon found
her charming.

35:06.572 --> 35:08.740
He took her under his wing.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.742
I didn't pay it
much attention.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.478
I was a new mother.

35:12.511 --> 35:16.482
Exhausted and overwhelmed.

35:18.617 --> 35:23.422
By the time I... realized
what was going on, I...

35:23.455 --> 35:27.826
well, I figured
let Gordon have his fun.

35:27.859 --> 35:31.630
Eventually, he'll tire of her,
come back to me.

35:31.663 --> 35:34.566
Then she got pregnant.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.736
I threatened to leave.

35:37.769 --> 35:40.772
But Gordon didn't want
a scandal.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.446
He begged me to stay.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.547
So I did.

35:50.216 --> 35:53.852
On the condition
that he let her go.

35:53.885 --> 35:57.589
And that was over 20 years ago.

35:57.623 --> 36:01.793
Somehow the past always manages
to catch up to us.

36:03.362 --> 36:05.264
She must be,
what, uh...

36:05.297 --> 36:07.933
20, 21 now?

36:10.302 --> 36:12.771
Camilla was quite
the beauty.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.243
I imagine she is too.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.412
She is.

36:22.914 --> 36:26.785
FRANKIE: My mom never told me
who my father was.

36:26.818 --> 36:29.921
But she'd tell me
stories about him,

36:29.955 --> 36:32.924
how he loved
art and books,

36:32.958 --> 36:35.361
how she'd leave him
letters in the desk.

36:35.394 --> 36:39.365
But I thought she was just
making it up, you know?

36:39.398 --> 36:42.768
Like some fairy tale you tell a
kid before bed.

36:42.801 --> 36:46.372
Must have believed it a little.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.607
Told Nick about it, right?

36:52.278 --> 36:55.547
Guessing this was his surprise.

36:57.015 --> 36:58.850
Give you everything
you never had.

36:58.884 --> 37:01.953
Family.

37:03.822 --> 37:08.827
Thing is-- family is
what you make of it.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.963
Sometimes it's simple.

37:12.964 --> 37:15.834
Most times it's not.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.877
PRIDE:
Thank you.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.989
I don't know
if I can do this.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.993
She's lost her son.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.830
Husband before that.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.399
You lost your mom
and now Nick.

37:49.034 --> 37:51.002
Possible there's
a version of this

37:51.036 --> 37:54.005
where the two of you salvage
the wreckage together.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.686
Francesca.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.425
Sheila.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.866
BRODY:
Thank you.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.869
Wow, I don't even mind
that it's warm.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.937
'Cause we earned it.
LASALLE: You got that right.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.507
SONJA: And boom.
LASALLE: Hey, hey, hey.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.376
Handy Mouse is in the house.

38:30.409 --> 38:32.378
Yes, she is.

38:32.411 --> 38:34.480
PRIDE: Oh, there's light!

38:34.513 --> 38:37.015
Got to hand it to
you, Percy. You win.

38:37.048 --> 38:39.017
Pride owes you a hundred bucks.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.752
Damn straight.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.021
But the truth is...

38:43.054 --> 38:44.490
What the hell, man?

38:44.523 --> 38:46.091
Hey, I kind of
like the blackout.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.926
Reminds me of back home.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.628
Simpler times.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.030
Aw, listen to Country Mouse
waxing poetic.

38:52.063 --> 38:54.032
BRODY: Yeah,
I'm with Lasalle.

38:54.065 --> 38:55.401
I kind of like the mood
lighting once in a while.

38:55.434 --> 38:56.802
Thank you.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.037
King, what about you,
where do you stand?

38:59.070 --> 39:01.940
Think maybe...

39:01.973 --> 39:04.510
I'm ready for some light.
SONJA : Yeah.

39:04.543 --> 39:05.911
Oh!
Yeah.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.112
Fair enough.

39:07.145 --> 39:08.113
So, Percy...

39:08.146 --> 39:10.048
Mmm.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.049
LASALLE:
Oh no.

39:11.082 --> 39:12.651
Yes, sir.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.986
Was that the electrician
from the sub station

39:15.020 --> 39:16.955
I just saw leaving?
LASALLE: Oh!

39:16.988 --> 39:19.124
From the Handy Mouse
to the Shady Mouse.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.792
What!

39:20.826 --> 39:22.528
Well, you know,
I think the point is...

39:22.561 --> 39:23.962
Uh...

39:23.995 --> 39:26.798
...that light is a
good thing, right?

39:26.832 --> 39:30.001
Well, I'll drink to that.
