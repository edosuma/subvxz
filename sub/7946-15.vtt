WEBVTT

00:03.211 --> 00:04.754
Wait, Bertram hasn't made breakfast yet?

00:04.838 --> 00:06.172
Why didn't someone go get him?

00:06.256 --> 00:08.508
Although we are famished,
we have mixed emotions

00:08.591 --> 00:10.552
about encouraging Bertram to cook.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.805
Don't worry, I'll whip up
a Fort Tavey specialty.

00:13.888 --> 00:16.599
All I need is five kinds of jalapenos
and a gallon of lard.

00:17.475 --> 00:18.893
Bertram!

00:21.104 --> 00:23.064
One healthy breakfast, coming up!

00:25.400 --> 00:26.443
Wow.

00:29.571 --> 00:30.613
Uh...

00:31.406 --> 00:34.909
So Bertram, you gonna
introduce us to your little friend?

00:36.077 --> 00:38.079
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.791
Then that toupee glue
must have soaked into your brain.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.754
Did you guys forget
that tonight is my reunion concert

00:45.837 --> 00:48.214
for my boy band, Badd Direction?

00:49.883 --> 00:52.635
How could we forget?
You've been talking about it for a month!

00:52.719 --> 00:54.596
That's longer than the band existed!

00:55.764 --> 00:59.142
Hey,"Grill Marks on my Heart"
went to number five in Finland.

00:59.392 --> 01:03.730
To this day, I can still get
free stuffed herring anywhere in Helsinki.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.902
But that does not explain the hedgehog
on your head.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.946
Back then I was called, the Hair.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.240
This is what my fans want to see.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.035
Trust me, nobody wants to see that.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.329
I better put this away,

01:19.412 --> 01:21.247
so it doesn't get messed up
before the show tonight.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.375
Also, it might want to run
on its exercise wheel.

02:24.602 --> 02:25.603
I don't know about blessed.

02:28.565 --> 02:32.402
Mine says I have
a large sum of money coming my way.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.154
Did something happen to Grandma?

02:35.363 --> 02:37.323
Try to at least sound concerned.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.869
Ooh, I'm going to be on a magazine cover!

02:40.952 --> 02:41.995
That's your fortune?

02:42.078 --> 02:43.538
No, I just got an email.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.624
All right, who stole my hair?

02:46.708 --> 02:48.460
-Father Time?
-Mother Nature?

02:50.170 --> 02:52.005
No, I mean my toupee.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.091
I already lost my hair once.
I can't lose it again!

02:55.633 --> 02:56.968
Can't you get a new one?

02:57.052 --> 02:59.637
Something more Brad Pitt, less armpit?

03:00.764 --> 03:02.349
No, it was custom made.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.184
My concert's in a few hours,

03:04.267 --> 03:08.021
and the Hair can't be the only guy
in the band without any hair!

03:08.605 --> 03:10.273
Don't worry, Bertram.
I'll help you find it.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.442
It'll be perfect practice for my audition.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.736
I'm up for the role of
Detective Phyllis Marlowe

03:14.819 --> 03:16.404
in a film noir TV commercial.

03:16.488 --> 03:20.617
We know. You've been making us watch
all those 1940s mystery movies.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.869
The mystery is how we stayed awake.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.456
And why everyone talked
so weird back then?

03:26.915 --> 03:28.416
They sounded totes cray.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.212
So, what's the commercial for?

03:32.295 --> 03:34.506
Oh, Legs Up Bug Spray.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.508
But it's only gonna air
in foreign markets.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.302
Because it was just banned
in the United States.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.805
Hey, it was supposed
to kill roaches, and it did.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.765
It just didn't stop there.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.563
So, blondie, do you have
anything you'd like to tell me?

03:50.897 --> 03:53.608
Yeah. You're dressing
for the wrong century.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.195
And why are you talking
like a silent movie?

03:57.278 --> 04:00.198
Nobody talks in silent mo--
Oh, never mind.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.285
I am in character. It helps me think.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.663
So, why do you assume I took the toupee?

04:06.746 --> 04:09.040
Because I found glittery footprints

04:09.124 --> 04:10.375
leading up to Bertram's room,

04:10.458 --> 04:12.210
a flake of your nail polish
on the wig stand,

04:12.293 --> 04:14.462
and your nameplate necklace
at the scene of the crime!

04:14.546 --> 04:16.256
That's all you've got?

04:16.339 --> 04:17.340
No.

04:17.549 --> 04:20.218
I also found this lock of golden hair.

04:20.301 --> 04:23.304
-That's not mine!
-Good thing, because it's dry, brittle,

04:23.388 --> 04:24.973
and has horrible split ends.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.349
How dare you!

04:26.433 --> 04:27.976
I just had a hydrating treatment!

04:29.019 --> 04:31.521
So it is yours!
Tell me everything you know.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.772
Including the name of that treatment.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.859
I was only trying to help!

04:36.151 --> 04:38.194
I couldn't let Bertram
wear that wig the way it was.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.487
So, I decided to give it a makeover...

04:39.571 --> 04:42.032
And just like that,
she sang like a canary.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.118
Emma Ross was a snazzy dame.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.745
She knew that if being ugly were a crime,

04:46.828 --> 04:48.371
that toupee would go
straight to the slammer.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.582
Ow!

04:53.293 --> 04:54.753
Oh, that's better.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.922
She was only trying to help the help,

04:58.006 --> 04:59.841
who was up coif creek without a comb.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.593
So she tried some conditioner,

05:01.801 --> 05:03.136
and it might've worked,

05:03.219 --> 05:05.138
except this wasn't
your run-of-the-mill mop.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.098
No!

05:07.599 --> 05:10.477
Why would the big palooka
buy such cheap hair?

05:10.560 --> 05:13.605
We really should give the poor,
sweet lug a raise.

05:15.940 --> 05:16.941
Well, that's better.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.946
I didn't know the toupee would react
to my conditioner like that!

05:22.030 --> 05:25.408
I can't believe Bertram planned
to make a comeback in synthetic hair!

05:26.785 --> 05:28.286
The man does love his coupons.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.539
So where's the toupee?

05:31.623 --> 05:33.249
I hid it in the living room cabinet.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.210
Where we keep the school supplies?

05:35.460 --> 05:38.129
Brilliant! No one would ever
suspect you of opening that.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.923
I know, right?

05:40.840 --> 05:43.760
But when I went back later
to see if the toupee had de-puffed,

05:43.843 --> 05:45.178
it was gone!

05:47.931 --> 05:48.932
Wait!

05:49.182 --> 05:50.475
I know who has the toupee!

05:50.809 --> 05:52.227
It was in the school supply cabinet,

05:52.310 --> 05:55.146
and the only person who does
schoolwork around here is Ravi!

05:55.230 --> 05:57.440
Of course!

05:58.400 --> 05:59.693
So, who has the toupee?

06:01.361 --> 06:03.863
We should use your college fund
on a nice vacation.

06:09.911 --> 06:10.954
Bertram?

06:11.204 --> 06:14.207
You're supposed to be on stage
in Central Park in three hours.

06:14.457 --> 06:17.877
Are you rehearsing any dance steps
besides the Sitting Man?

06:19.504 --> 06:21.840
I can't do my moves without my hair.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.508
I have nothing to flip.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.013
You dance with your feet,
not your follicles.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.473
Come on, show me what you got.
I'll give you some pointers.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.643
Well, in case Jessie does find my toupee,

06:34.269 --> 06:38.648
I guess I should be ready to dazzle them
with my high-energy funk.

06:40.859 --> 06:41.860
Help me up.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.431
Wow.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.058
That was great!

07:13.850 --> 07:16.436
Uh, but maybe you could do it
a little more like this.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.990
If I had my hair, I could do that.

07:30.825 --> 07:31.826
Really?

07:32.202 --> 07:33.620
So it had magical powers?

07:38.166 --> 07:39.626
Okay, there's no need to be nervous.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.836
-I'm just going to ask you a few--
-I am guilty!

07:43.421 --> 07:46.424
Send me to my room
until college entrance exams!

07:46.966 --> 07:48.426
Okay, I appreciate your honesty,

07:48.510 --> 07:51.221
but you confessing so quick
really takes the fun out of this for me.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.600
Oh, I apologize, Jessie.
Shall I resist more?

07:55.684 --> 07:57.018
Oh, just tell me what you know.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.104
This girdle's really tight,
and I have to go to the bathroom.

08:01.439 --> 08:05.110
It was a classic case of being
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.529
I had just color-coordinated
my kurta closet...

08:07.612 --> 08:10.573
Ravi folded faster
than a dry cleaner at quitting time.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.034
The poor crumb found the toupee

08:13.118 --> 08:15.453
while pilfering recreational
homework supplies.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.580
Even his crimes were boring.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.959
What is this puzzling puffball?

08:22.711 --> 08:25.505
You are right! It is Bertram's toupee!

08:25.922 --> 08:27.090
We must fix this.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.427
Fine, I will fix it.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.638
You know, it would not kill you to lift
a claw around here once in a while.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.101
Ravi wanted to return the toupee,

08:38.184 --> 08:40.311
but he knew if Bertram
took a gander at it now,

08:40.395 --> 08:43.648
it would take him on a one-way trip
over Breakdown Falls.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.572
Huzzah! Success!

08:50.655 --> 08:51.906
Oh!

08:51.990 --> 08:55.785
Dear gods!
Mrs. Kipling, do you smell that?

08:58.997 --> 09:00.707
I will take that as a yes.

09:01.916 --> 09:05.420
Ravi had no choice but to take
the noxious noggin warmer to...

09:05.879 --> 09:07.547
The Fixer.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.258
Aw, lemons!

09:11.634 --> 09:13.428
Are you the Fixer?

09:13.970 --> 09:15.263
Who wants to know?

09:16.348 --> 09:18.266
I do. That is why I asked.

09:19.601 --> 09:20.894
How'd you get up here?

09:21.186 --> 09:23.521
Remind me to have my doorman rubbed out,

09:23.938 --> 09:26.024
and I don't mean by a masseuse.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.361
Ms. Fixer, I need your help.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.863
I am desperate to get this problem fixed.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.698
So why are you twisting my nose about it?

09:33.782 --> 09:36.201
Because your nickname
and your business card

09:36.284 --> 09:38.787
rather strongly imply that you fix things.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.163
Oh!

09:40.246 --> 09:43.333
Yeah, but that thing stinks
like last week's chop suey.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.836
Perhaps this will help?

09:52.258 --> 09:54.052
Deal. Now beat it,

09:54.344 --> 09:57.305
unless you want to stick around
for a knuckle sandwich.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.057
Oh, no, thank you. I just ate.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.939
Oh, I get it.
That was a threat, not a menu item.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.400
Oh!

10:10.485 --> 10:12.404
-So Zuri has the toupee?
-Yes.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.447
And all of my vacation money.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.992
Which, let us face it, I was probably
going to use for college anyway.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.461
This is hopeless!

10:28.545 --> 10:31.631
Bertram, the problem isn't your dancing,
it's your attitude.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.216
And also your dancing.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.303
You have to show some confidence on stage.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.513
Think of your fans.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.682
This performance
is the highlight of their lives,

10:40.932 --> 10:42.934
which I have to assume
are profoundly empty.

10:44.894 --> 10:48.064
But they're expecting "the Hair,"
not the Scalp.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.774
Well, then, maybe you could
have a different nickname.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.527
-Like what?
-Like... "The Hoarder!"

10:53.028 --> 10:54.154
-Or "the Napper."
-Oh! Oh!

10:54.237 --> 10:57.991
How about "the One with an Unhealthy
Obsession for Nesting Dolls"?

10:58.533 --> 11:00.243
That won't fit on a T-shirt!

11:01.619 --> 11:02.954
Maybe you could be...

11:03.455 --> 11:05.081
-"The Hat"?
-Yeah!

11:05.165 --> 11:07.751
We had the Hat. He quit the band!

11:08.585 --> 11:10.712
You know nothing about Badd Direction!

11:15.008 --> 11:18.303
Hey, all I did was take the toupee
and get the smell out,

11:18.386 --> 11:19.846
just like Ravi wanted.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.849
That's a relief.
I knew you were a good kid.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.310
Despite what Kenny Chesney's
bodyguard says.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.271
So, where's the toupee?

11:28.355 --> 11:29.522
Up a tree.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.149
Please tell me that's a metaphor.

11:31.232 --> 11:34.110
Nope. See, I tried to wash it,

11:34.194 --> 11:36.988
but that did not go so well.
I was just following...

11:37.072 --> 11:39.324
Everyone knew the Fixer had many skills,

11:40.200 --> 11:41.826
but laundry wasn't one of them.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.412
Aw, nuts!

11:46.247 --> 11:48.958
Maybe five bottles
of bubble bath was too much.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.337
Smells beautiful, though.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.965
The Fixer may have nixed the stink,

11:56.049 --> 11:57.967
but she was about to eat crow.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.594
Hey!

11:59.678 --> 12:01.638
This job is for the birds!

12:08.186 --> 12:10.063
So, let me see if I follow your tune.

12:10.146 --> 12:13.191
Some sticky-taloned Maltese
falcon air-lifted the wacky weave

12:13.274 --> 12:14.651
to tall, green, and leafy over here?

12:16.027 --> 12:19.197
If you have an English button,
please push it!

12:20.323 --> 12:22.701
Sorry, but I am paying $100
for a dialogue coach

12:22.784 --> 12:24.869
for a 30-second commercial.
I gotta get my money's worth.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.582
Now, are you sure you saw the bird
bring Bertram's toupee to this tree?

12:29.666 --> 12:33.086
Definitely. I watched the whole thing
through the telescope.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.338
Well, there's no hairpiece up here.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.508
Just some binoculars,
and alarmingly large eggs.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.178
No! No!

12:42.262 --> 12:43.722
Take that, stupid bird!

12:48.309 --> 12:49.853
My belt is stuck on the branch.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.857
Wait, these are Luke's and...

12:53.940 --> 12:55.233
I know this tree.

12:55.525 --> 12:58.653
Zuri, you said the bird snatched
the toupee at 4:15?

12:58.737 --> 12:59.863
Yeah, why?

12:59.946 --> 13:04.367
Because this is where Luke sits to watch
the 4 p.m. Ladies Trampoline Practice.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.579
He must've been up here when the bird
snatched the toup to its coop.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.372
Thank you, Dr. Seuss.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.167
Oh, no!

13:12.250 --> 13:15.587
He's coming back! Help me!
Get me down, quick! Now! Now!

13:20.800 --> 13:22.427
What? You said "quick."

13:26.931 --> 13:29.100
♪ I'm burned but I am free ♪

13:29.184 --> 13:32.979
♪ No more grill marks on my heart ♪

13:35.565 --> 13:38.234
So, what do you think
of our hit music video?

13:38.318 --> 13:39.819
I think people must not have had

13:39.903 --> 13:42.030
a lot of entertainment options back then.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.742
Okay, we've all seen Bertram's...

13:46.534 --> 13:47.577
talents.

13:48.411 --> 13:49.621
So now let's help him rehearse.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.665
Thanks, but I'm not going on.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.126
I don't want to be the only one up there
with no hair.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.878
Hey, don't think about that.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.923
Just remember you have great hair...

14:01.591 --> 14:02.967
on the inside.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.930
I'm sure in your warped mind
that was encouraging.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.058
Okay, I'll give it a go.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.143
But just like when I tried skinny jeans,

14:12.519 --> 14:14.145
I don't think this is gonna work.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.482
At least this time we won't have to use
the Jaws of Life!

14:19.609 --> 14:21.569
Why can I not be the cool one?

14:21.653 --> 14:22.946
Genetics.

14:24.155 --> 14:25.323
But don't feel bad.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.409
Luke will never read a book
without pictures.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.245
Okay, ready? And...

14:30.328 --> 14:32.789
Five, six, seven, eight.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.001

14:36.418 --> 14:37.711

14:46.302 --> 14:47.512
What happened here?

14:47.595 --> 14:50.098
All I know is we started cabbage patching.

14:50.598 --> 14:51.808
The rest is a blur.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.936
Here, Luke, let me help you up.

14:55.437 --> 14:56.479
Thank you.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.982
-A-ha! Look at your arm!
-I know...

14:59.065 --> 15:00.608
I've been working out, so.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.403
No, I mean, look at these scratches.

15:03.486 --> 15:04.821
You got these in the nest!

15:05.321 --> 15:06.740
You have the toupee!

15:07.115 --> 15:08.158
Hang on...

15:08.241 --> 15:09.951
all this time you were trying
to convince me

15:10.035 --> 15:11.578
I can get by without my hair,

15:11.661 --> 15:12.871
and it was you who stole it?

15:12.954 --> 15:14.456
Hey, wait, I can explain.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.041
So Luke took the toupee?

15:16.458 --> 15:18.043
I'm glad I'm not the only one.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.295
Wait a minute, you stole it too?

15:20.378 --> 15:22.255
Actually, Luke didn't steal it.

15:22.630 --> 15:23.840
He took it from a bird,

15:23.923 --> 15:25.633
who stole it from Zuri,
who got it from Ravi,

15:25.717 --> 15:28.678
who found it where Emma hid it,
after she took it from you. Ha!

15:29.179 --> 15:30.180
Man, I'm good!

15:30.638 --> 15:32.015
I'm gonna sell so much bug spray.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.101
Okay, so I took it!

15:35.185 --> 15:38.104
But what was I supposed to do,
leave it in that tree?

15:38.188 --> 15:39.981
I was trying to do Bertram a favor.

15:40.482 --> 15:42.650
See, Melinda had just done
a double backflip,

15:42.734 --> 15:44.110
when I noticed the toupee.

15:47.072 --> 15:49.741
Luke started yammering
that the toupee was in bad shape

15:49.991 --> 15:53.036
because he had to wrestle it away
from a pterodactyl with a temper.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.080
Why, I haven't seen this many feathers

15:55.163 --> 15:57.707
since I got tangled up in that kick line
at the Cotton Club!

15:59.709 --> 16:01.628
He didn't want to get caught
holding the rug,

16:02.337 --> 16:03.880
but before he could fix it...

16:09.427 --> 16:10.804
Hey, Bertie!

16:10.887 --> 16:12.806
What brings you into
this neck of the woods?

16:12.889 --> 16:16.101
My job, unfortunately.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.687
Oh, cheer up, bub.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.230
The Great Depression is over.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.816
You haven't seen my paycheck.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.276
Out!

16:30.615 --> 16:32.701
I meant to go back
and get the toupee cleaned up,

16:32.784 --> 16:35.036
but I've been so busy helping Bertram
with his choreography,

16:35.120 --> 16:36.454
I totally forgot about it.

16:36.538 --> 16:39.165
How could you forget you had my toupee?

16:39.249 --> 16:41.626
All day I've been talking about
how much I need it.

16:41.710 --> 16:45.130
In my defense,
your dancing is very distracting.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.633
Okay, so apparently everyone's guilty.

16:48.717 --> 16:51.011
First thing tomorrow,
I'll issue a mass grounding.

16:51.094 --> 16:54.014
But for now, the important thing is
we know where the toupee is!

16:54.097 --> 16:57.600
-It's in the freezer!
-Well, an icy toupee is fine with me!

16:57.976 --> 17:00.729
It'll thaw out
before my first pop 'n lock.

17:02.147 --> 17:04.941
Is he talking about
his dance moves, or his joints?

17:07.819 --> 17:09.070
I don't see it!

17:09.195 --> 17:10.697
-There it is!
-My toupee?

17:10.780 --> 17:13.158
No, but I solved the mystery
of the missing remote.

17:13.241 --> 17:14.576
Yay!

17:20.707 --> 17:22.042
Now, I'm not trying to accuse anyone,

17:22.125 --> 17:23.418
but one of you has the toupee.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.170
Jessie, I do not mean to pick nits,

17:25.253 --> 17:27.672
but that is a textbook example
of an accusation.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.301
Now, listen here.
You were all in on the grift.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.763
You're all hoodlums, punks,
goons, flimflam artists...

17:34.846 --> 17:37.223
If she keeps talking like this,
I'm calling a doctor.

17:39.267 --> 17:40.393
Cram it, Jeeves!

17:41.728 --> 17:43.730
It's her process. Just go with it.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.525
Now, whoever took that toupee
out of the freezer

17:47.609 --> 17:49.736
and isn't coming clean
is the lowest of the low.

17:51.488 --> 17:52.739
Can it, Kippy.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.868
Perhaps Mrs. Kipling is hungry.

17:56.951 --> 18:00.038
She can't be. I just gave her
some grub. Two frozen rats.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.792
Really? Then that means

18:03.875 --> 18:06.044
you were the last one
in the freezer, Jessie.

18:06.127 --> 18:09.047
And that's where the toupee was last seen.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.800
Wait, you guys think I pinched the rug?

18:11.883 --> 18:13.426
That's a bunch of hooey!

18:13.510 --> 18:15.345
I never touched it, see,
and I'll prove it to you.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.596
Here's what happened...

18:16.680 --> 18:19.057
Rat wrangling
was never my favorite chore.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.893
But still, this dame was game.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.939
I gave a hungry lizard
her chow, and that's all she wrote.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.941
Anyone who thinks
I took Bertram's toupee is...

18:33.321 --> 18:34.364
Ugh.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.785
There's a rat in this story,
and it's not the one Kipling ate!

18:39.244 --> 18:42.122
You fed Bertram's toupee to Mrs. Kipling?

18:42.205 --> 18:44.332
It was an honest mistake!

18:44.499 --> 18:46.376
I didn't mean to mess up the toupee!

18:46.459 --> 18:47.919
We messed it up.

18:48.003 --> 18:49.170
You destroyed it.

18:49.254 --> 18:51.673
And you call yourself a fake detective.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.758
Hey, I'm the one who solved the crime!

18:53.842 --> 18:55.260
You committed the crime!

18:55.343 --> 18:56.928
I'm pretty sure those cancel
each other out!

18:57.012 --> 18:59.222
No, no...

18:59.305 --> 19:01.933
Stop it! You were all involved in this.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.644
And thanks to you,
my reunion concert is ruined!

19:06.688 --> 19:08.940
Nanny, ground thyself.

19:13.778 --> 19:14.988
Hey, Bertram.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.032
I'm sorry I fed your toupee to the lizard.

19:17.115 --> 19:19.284
I tried to find a card for that,
but no such luck.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.288
It's okay. You didn't know
what you were doing.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.290
Which is kind of par for the course.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.710
Look, Bertram,

19:29.127 --> 19:31.254
I really think you should perform
with Badd Direction.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.757
You've waited 25 years for this!

19:33.840 --> 19:36.551
I can't. Not without my secret weapon.

19:36.634 --> 19:39.262
Well, I've only known you
without your hair, and...

19:39.679 --> 19:40.722
I think you're wonderful.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.600
I mean, think of all
the things you're good at.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.185
-Like what?
-Well, you can...

19:45.268 --> 19:46.519
Yeah?

19:46.895 --> 19:48.480
-And there's...
-Uh, yeah.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.900
Let's not get bogged down in the details.

19:53.193 --> 19:56.654
The point is, every single one of
those kids went out of their way

19:56.738 --> 19:58.323
to make sure you looked great tonight.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.325
I mean, Zuri did laundry for you.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.577
That was sweet.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.412
By the way, the new machine's
coming tomorrow.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.626
Look, we all believe in you, Bertram.

20:10.418 --> 20:11.586
- Really?
- Really.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.214
Aww...

20:17.967 --> 20:19.969
We are your secret weapon.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.388
And we'll be rooting for you

20:21.471 --> 20:22.806
when you are up on that stage tonight,

20:22.889 --> 20:25.892
showing everyone why you still get
free fish in Finland.

20:27.227 --> 20:28.478
I appreciate it, guys, but--

20:28.561 --> 20:30.563
No, no, no. No buts.

20:30.647 --> 20:31.731
Now you get up on that stage

20:31.815 --> 20:33.817
and you give those fans
what they've been waiting for.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.527
Their social security checks?

20:37.612 --> 20:38.655
No!

20:39.155 --> 20:40.990
Badd Direction has a new direction,

20:41.074 --> 20:43.201
and it's bigger, better, and bald!

20:44.244 --> 20:47.247
You're right! I'm going to go out there
and give it my all!

20:47.956 --> 20:49.207
I just hope they don't laugh at me.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.626
Of course they won't laugh at you!

20:51.710 --> 20:54.587
They spent $65 to see
some middle-aged one-hit wonders.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.631
They have no business laughing at anybody.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.140
I'm so happy for Bertram!

21:47.223 --> 21:48.433
Me too!

21:48.516 --> 21:50.685
And I actually enjoyed the concert.

21:51.061 --> 21:53.897
Although, Bertram's crowd surfing
was rather unpleasant.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.399
His heinie is excessively sweaty.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.823
You're all bald, too?

22:05.075 --> 22:07.911
Wow! And I thought
the fans were flipping their wigs.

22:08.578 --> 22:11.206
See? All Bertram needed
was a little confidence.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.670
You are all my disciples!

22:16.753 --> 22:20.048
And I am a golden god!

22:21.257 --> 22:22.258
Wow.

22:22.342 --> 22:25.845
I think we built up his confidence
a little too much.

22:26.471 --> 22:29.140
Oh, no! He's gonna crowd surf again!

22:29.224 --> 22:30.517
Run!

22:32.435 --> 22:35.021
So, the bug spray people
told me to bug off.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.524
My career was as dead as those roaches.

22:38.066 --> 22:41.152
But at least I cracked
the case of the Wandering Wig.

22:41.903 --> 22:42.904
Still...

22:42.987 --> 22:45.532
there was one little question
gnawing at me.

22:45.824 --> 22:47.242
If the lizard ate the hair,

22:47.325 --> 22:49.452
then why hadn't the perp pooped the toup?
