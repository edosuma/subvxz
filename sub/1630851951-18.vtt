I didn't realize the door
was so far away.

I likes to shop.

warned us.

00:16.951 --> 00:20.419
'Cause I am sore from my
waist down to my pinky toes

00:20.554 --> 00:22.855

00:22.990 --> 00:24.256

00:24.392 --> 00:25.924
I think we should do karaoke
next.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.292
- I have never done karaoke.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.261
- Really?
- Nope.

00:29.397 --> 00:32.131
Never performed on any stage
of any kind.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.867
Oh, except that time
when I got drunk

00:35.002 --> 00:37.669
at an Al Green concert.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.639
I tried to give him some love

It would've been worth it.

I think instead of us going
out to do karaoke

00:56.390 --> 00:58.791
maybe we should do like a
talent show right here.

00:58.926 --> 01:02.394
- We could call it Pleasant
Days' Got Talent!

01:02.530 --> 01:05.397
- Oh, yes!
And we can involve everybody

01:05.533 --> 01:07.332
and they can show off
their talent.

a dream of mine

01:09.870 --> 01:13.772
to perform like Diana Ross
and the Supremes.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.240
- Wow.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.543
- But that's one thing I never
crossed off my bucket list.

we can help you with.

over here meant because we

already got chairs there

06:35.796 --> 06:38.196
- You can't rush art, darling.

06:38.332 --> 06:41.099
You wouldn't tell the Mona
Lisa she was late.

06:41.235 --> 06:44.002
- The Mona Lisa wouldn't be on
C-P time.

06:44.138 --> 06:45.670

You know what?

06:45.806 --> 06:47.305
I'm just happy that you're
here.

06:47.441 --> 06:50.208
You know, we was going
over some song ideas.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.344
- We were thinking some
classics like

06:52.479 --> 06:54.413
"Stop In the Name of Love".

06:54.548 --> 06:55.814
- You stop, darling.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.988
I wrote this little piece this
afternoon.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.890

songwriter.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.626

07:21.442 --> 07:27.078
"Entangle me with your love,
hee-hee-hee."

she needs to duck.

As in delete these lyrics.

07:37.724 --> 07:38.957
- What was that?

07:39.092 --> 07:42.127
- Oh, she said it sounds
so sweet.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.229
You know, and I also was
talking to her,

07:44.364 --> 07:45.730
we did some dance moves.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.365
We talked about it when
we went shopping.

07:47.501 --> 07:48.700
- OH, no, no, no.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.202
I want to keep things
really simple.

07:50.337 --> 07:53.505
Just the two of you in the
background behind me swaying.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.440
- Wait a minute.

07:55.576 --> 07:58.944
We didn't agree to do all this
just to be in the background.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.779
- I knew it was just a matter
of time

08:00.914 --> 08:03.215
before the jealousy set in.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.150
- What?!

08:05.285 --> 08:08.019
- I am Diana Ross.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.323
You two are just the Supremes.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.458
- Come on, Anastasia, play nice.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.293
- Yeah.

08:15.429 --> 08:18.530
- That's why I decided to go
solo.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.966
Toodles, Pips.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.802
- Miss Cora,
what just happened?

08:25.839 --> 08:27.305
- I don't know.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.941
- Five, six, seven, eight.

08:33.547 --> 08:34.946
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.314
You're a little off.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.650
- Well, I'm not off, this is
the routine.

08:38.785 --> 08:41.553
It was Mya and Sisqo
"It's All About Me."

08:41.688 --> 08:43.755
- [audience laughing]

08:43.891 --> 08:45.690
- The routine was
Bobby and Whitney

08:45.826 --> 08:47.158
"Something In Common."

08:47.294 --> 08:49.561
- I remember it clearly
because you dyed your hair

08:49.696 --> 08:51.129
like Sisqo.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.665
- JEREMY: I know for a fact
that it was Bobby and Whitney

08:53.800 --> 08:55.700
because you wouldn't let me
get a Gumby

08:55.836 --> 08:59.070
and suspenders
with biker shorts.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.173
- That was "Every Little Step
I take", Bobby.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.209
