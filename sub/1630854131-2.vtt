WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:04.972
The ranch.
I want to buy it.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.241
I already have numerous offers.
All cash.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.410
Do these people know about
the drug lab in the basement?

00:09.443 --> 00:14.148
Your [sighs] offer is lower
than the others I've received.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.549
It's the right offer, Tonya.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.385
I'm accepting.

00:17.418 --> 00:20.654
Emily's on a trip with her
stepdad. They're camping.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.424
Oh, I'd just like
to knuckle dunk his teeth in.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.426
Oh, I'd get that
if I were you.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.861
Uh, no, it's okay.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.205
Hello again, friend.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.875
What can I do you for?

00:41.909 --> 00:43.544
The family of a backpacker
contacted the office.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.246
They haven't heard from him
in a while.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.781
Years ago, my neighbor's son's
girlfriend disappeared,

00:47.815 --> 00:49.250
and that's where
it happened.

00:49.283 --> 00:51.585
Was she found?
Her heart had been cut out.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.587
I know you're out there.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.828
My sweet boy.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.398
Do we have a problem?

01:04.432 --> 01:06.467
How did you know?

01:06.500 --> 01:08.602
A mother always knows.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.938
But you can't be here, Walt.

01:10.971 --> 01:13.274
I know that, Mama.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.109
Remember?

01:15.143 --> 01:17.611
You have <i>your</i> place.

01:17.645 --> 01:20.948
You stay there,
everything's peachy keen.

01:20.981 --> 01:23.517
You know our deal.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.121
I need to
show you something.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.063
He fell.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.634
He fell?

01:40.668 --> 01:42.636
Yes, ma'am.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.638
It's the truth.

01:44.672 --> 01:48.809
He fell off
of Deadman's Drop.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.811
I-I didn't know
what to do, so--

01:50.844 --> 01:52.646
so I brought him here.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.484
I'll handle this.
Go on.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.687
Go on!

02:14.835 --> 02:18.172
Help m-me.

02:18.206 --> 02:21.209
Ohh.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.844
You sure have a lot of people
worried about you.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.679
Just worried sick.

02:25.713 --> 02:28.482
Your poor, poor mama.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.051
Sometimes I think "mother"

02:31.084 --> 02:33.454
is just another word
for heartbreak.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.856
Hospital.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.666
It hurts.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.469
I know, sweetheart.
I know it does.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.741
But I've got a child of my own
to protect.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.676
I hope you understand.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.945
It's not
gonna be much longer.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.714
Help me.

03:00.748 --> 03:04.485
♪ I'll always love him

03:04.518 --> 03:08.155
♪ I'll never deny him

03:08.188 --> 03:11.592
♪ I'll always love him

03:11.625 --> 03:15.929
♪ Till the day that I die

03:28.876 --> 03:31.745
It's all over now.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.915
Ahh.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.295
Yep. That's him.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.762
You're sure?

03:48.796 --> 03:50.298
Yeah. It's hard to forget
a face like that.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.199
H-How did he seem to you?
Depressed?

03:52.232 --> 03:53.967
Like he was running
from something?

03:54.001 --> 03:55.569
No.
It was nothing like that.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.805
He-- He was vibing
on the trails.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.608
I just... asked if he wanted
to grab a couple beers with us

04:00.641 --> 04:04.412
down at the hot springs,
and he clearly chose the trails.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.079
Oh, no.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.482
Girls, as a rule,
we never invite

04:08.516 --> 04:10.918
a handsome stranger
back to a remote campsite.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.753
That features
in my top 10 serial-killer

04:12.786 --> 04:14.488
"most certain death"
scenarios.

04:14.522 --> 04:15.756
He's a serial killer?

04:15.789 --> 04:18.258
No.
Denise, come on.
Just sayin'.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.060
Well, lucky for us,
he seemed more interested

04:20.093 --> 04:22.129
in Deadman's Drop.
Deadman's Drop?

04:22.162 --> 04:25.366
I-Is that the decommissioned
trail off the Basin Trailhead?

04:26.334 --> 04:28.936
Yeah. I told him
it was all washed out.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.270
But I don't know.
Maybe it appealed

04:30.304 --> 04:32.606
to some sort of
male expedition fantasy.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.274
Well, no wonder
no one's heard from him.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.410
You think something bad
happened to him?

04:36.444 --> 04:37.678
He seemed like a nice guy.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.313
Uh, we're not sure.

04:39.347 --> 04:41.849
But we appreciate
you calling in the tip.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.217
Thank you.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.988
Okay.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.657
Looks like
we're going hiking.

04:49.690 --> 04:50.991
We?
Yes.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.927
Who's we? Because, uh,
me and my sciatica

04:53.961 --> 04:57.097
have plans to park it here
all afternoon, so...

04:57.130 --> 04:59.266
Okay.
I'm flyin' solo, then.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.370
No. Cassie, you can't go hiking
on those trails by yourself.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.772
Why don't you call
Jenny or Beau-Beau,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.440
see if one of them
can come?

05:06.474 --> 05:08.308
That's a good idea.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.614
Oh! Mmm!
Good, right?

05:13.647 --> 05:15.215
That is so good!

05:15.248 --> 05:17.485
There's, like, layers of flavor
with the pickled onions--

05:17.518 --> 05:18.952
The fries, beef tallow.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.221
I don't even know
what that is.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.190
Hoyt!
Oh, you gotta try this!

05:23.223 --> 05:24.725
It's from
the Blue Fox Diner.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.727
It's a new menu item.
I'm sort of the beta tester.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.796
Please tell me
that's not true.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.399
What, is there some sort
of health-code violation
I need to know about?

05:31.432 --> 05:33.734
No.
That's Tonya's place.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.203
Copy that.
Your mortal enemy.

05:36.236 --> 05:38.138
Well, she makes
a damn good sandwich.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.974
No. Tonya doesn't make anything.
It's her bearded lapdog, Donno.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.810
Well, not for nothing,
but that guy's got skills.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.912
Everybody has
their own unique gift.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.080
Tonya and Donno
are criminals.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.749
No, I heard
they went legit,

05:48.782 --> 05:50.384
so until you have something
that proves otherwise,

05:50.418 --> 05:52.720
I don't see why we can't enjoy
some tasty sandwiches.

05:52.753 --> 05:55.656
Tonya worked for a drug cartel,
one that killed people.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.324
Legit, my ass!

05:57.357 --> 05:58.992
I'm gonna get you proof.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.428
I'm gonna lock her up.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.530
Got a visitor.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.766
Before you lock me up...

06:05.799 --> 06:07.601
can you help me
with something?

06:07.635 --> 06:09.036
What can we do for ya?

06:09.069 --> 06:11.271
I've got a squatter
on one of my properties.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.941
Okay. Hoyt, why don't you see
if you can help her out?

06:13.974 --> 06:16.176
Law's the law. We don't
get to choose who we help.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.778
Right? Except for me.
I get to choose.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.948
Cassie called, and I'm gonna
help her with something, so...

06:31.391 --> 06:33.794
Okay, Emily,
so what we do is

06:33.827 --> 06:36.864
we put the food in here

06:36.897 --> 06:39.467
so the bear
can't get to it.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.868
Then we lock it up.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.473
Have you ever seen
a grizzly bear around here?

06:45.506 --> 06:47.274
What's this podcast for, exactly?

06:47.307 --> 06:50.478
Just... sorta my life,
I guess.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.645
All 15 years of it?

06:51.679 --> 06:53.447
16.

06:53.481 --> 06:57.117
So, yesterday you said it was
about secrets and relationships.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.552
What's it about today?

06:58.586 --> 07:01.121
Still finding my subject.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.423
Maybe...
things I'm afraid of?

07:03.457 --> 07:05.425
Oh!
Then bears it is.

07:05.459 --> 07:08.095
Yeah, I have seen
some bears up here.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.163
Um, pretty much learned that
if you leave them alone,

07:10.197 --> 07:11.732
they leave you alone.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.402
But never get in between
a mama bear and her cub.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.805
That's trouble
with a capital "T."

07:17.838 --> 07:20.340
Thanks.
You're welcome.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.409
Does your mom know
you're doing a podcast?

07:22.442 --> 07:23.644
She listens to them, too.
Yeah?

07:23.677 --> 07:26.279
Murder podcasts mostly. Mysteries.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.248
Me, romance.
Mm-hmm.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.751
Give me tall, dark,
and handsome any day.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.086
You kids can have
that murder stuff.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.988
Alright.
So we lock 'em up.

07:39.359 --> 07:40.761
Alright. Perfect.
Now let's go down

07:40.794 --> 07:42.696
and see what
they're cooking at camp.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.297
Oh, hon, can you
give us a sec?

07:44.331 --> 07:46.299
Yeah.
Thanks!

07:46.333 --> 07:47.635
How are ya?
Hi. Good.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.505
Oh, you got that look.

07:51.539 --> 07:52.873
Everything okay?

07:52.906 --> 07:56.476
Yeah. Great.
Beautiful morning. Yeah.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.111
What's on your mind?

07:58.145 --> 08:00.313
Well, you were gone for
quite a while last night.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.850
I got up
and couldn't find you.

08:04.017 --> 08:07.555
I went for a walk.
Moon was out.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.824
It was full, beautiful.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.662
Are you worried about
me being in the woods?

08:19.199 --> 08:21.401
Hey. What happened there?
You got blood.

08:21.434 --> 08:24.304
Oh, uh, I brought in
some firewood.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.007
Firewood?
Well, that's <i>my</i> job, honey.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.308
I know.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.977
Next time, wake me up.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.511
We'll figure out
something better to do

08:31.545 --> 08:34.481
than you walking around camp
stacking firewood...

08:34.514 --> 08:36.650
which doesn't need
to be stacked.

08:36.684 --> 08:39.086
You're so cute
when you're protective.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.154
Now I'm gonna go help
these people get ready to hike.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.156
Alright.
Love ya!

08:43.190 --> 08:44.692
Love you.

08:51.699 --> 08:55.769
Remember to stay on the marked
trails and take plenty of water.

08:55.803 --> 08:58.205
Honestly, you can't drink enough
around these parts.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.710
Nice catch there, babe.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.579
Maybe wait 'til I'm ready
next time.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.117
♪ Everybody floating
till the river runs dry ♪

09:10.150 --> 09:11.451
Thank you.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.087
It'll dry off.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.889
♪ Whispers like
a Southern breeze ♪

09:15.923 --> 09:18.558
Yeah.
She's fine there, Tex.

09:19.827 --> 09:20.961
Cormac.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.264
I was just trying
to be helpful.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.966
I can see that.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.135
Really?
Luke. Please.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.739
And, yeah, she's fine.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.373
But <i>you</i> could do
with some manners.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.342
Okay, boys. That's enough.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.879
Alright, everybody.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.213
You guys have fun...

09:40.247 --> 09:43.216
but most of all,
stay safe, okay?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.485
Take 'em on out.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.102
You know,
I have the number

10:02.135 --> 10:04.972
of a good auto-body repair shop
if you want.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.506
An officer of the law

10:06.539 --> 10:08.308
shouldn't be driving around
in such a junker.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.844
At least my ride wasn't bought
with blood money.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.446
This is your house?

10:13.480 --> 10:16.416
No. I'm helping the owner
sell it.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.985
They live out of state.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.319
You sure
the squatter's inside?

10:19.352 --> 10:22.122
Yes. I'm sure.
He refuses to leave.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.423
My associate's
with him now.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.692
Your associate?

10:24.725 --> 10:26.660
Let go!

10:36.904 --> 10:38.438
Let go of me, man!

10:38.471 --> 10:40.173
Hey!

10:41.341 --> 10:43.977
Sheriff's Department!
Stop!

10:44.011 --> 10:46.146
Let him go!
He's assaulting me.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.715
Oh, hello, Jenny.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.683
Are we friends?
No, we're not.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.184
Let him go, Donno.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.723
Sorry.
He wouldn't leave.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.925
I was enacting
a citizen's arrest. Ehp.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.961
So what's your name?

11:00.994 --> 11:03.296
Jef. With one "F."

11:03.330 --> 11:05.699
What are you doing here,
Jef with one "F"?

11:05.733 --> 11:07.034
I live here.
He does not.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.535
Actually, I do.

11:08.568 --> 11:10.337
I have a utility bill over
there. Wanna check it out?

11:13.673 --> 11:17.811
What? How did you get
a utility bill in your name?!

11:17.845 --> 11:19.479
Same way any other
legal tenant does.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.414
I want him out.
Now!

11:21.448 --> 11:23.383
That could take a while.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.052
What? Why?

11:25.085 --> 11:27.320
Homestead Act of 1862.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.656
It details Adverse Possession
laws for the state of Montana.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.658
He's talking about
squatter's rights.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.660
Basically, you'll need
a court order to evict him.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.328
I can't believe this.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.098
- What do we have here?
- Hey! Don't touch my stuff!

11:38.131 --> 11:39.933
What, you mean this stuff?
Give me that.

11:39.967 --> 11:43.536
Stop. You have no probable cause
to go through my--

11:45.305 --> 11:47.107
Ooh!

11:53.480 --> 11:56.049
Is this registered?

11:56.083 --> 11:58.051
I don't know. Maybe.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.052
It's a baby gun.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.620
It's a 9-millimeter.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.223
It's a .380.
Why do you know that?

12:03.256 --> 12:04.925
Under what name?

12:10.097 --> 12:12.265
Who are you,
Jef with one "F"?

12:20.473 --> 12:23.376
♪ Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

12:27.147 --> 12:30.818
♪ Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

12:33.821 --> 12:37.124

12:37.157 --> 12:40.660

12:44.031 --> 12:46.466
I ever tell you

12:46.499 --> 12:48.635
♪ Brand-new cowboy

12:48.668 --> 12:51.071
It's funny because
you kept going on and on

12:51.104 --> 12:52.639
about how you were
"born for the outdoors."

12:52.672 --> 12:54.007
What happened there?

12:54.041 --> 12:55.642
I stand by that,
but you didn't tell me

12:55.675 --> 12:57.978
we were going on a 12K
through the Grand Canyon!

12:58.011 --> 13:00.280
I'd have worn some marathon
boots and brought some oxygen.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.481
Wow.
Is this a tantrum?

13:01.514 --> 13:02.850
It is. Okay.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.318
There's footprints over there,
recent ones.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.254
Oh, on a hiking trail.
You don't say.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.856
Multiple sets
of footprints.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.657
It's a decommissioned trail,
one that we know

13:10.690 --> 13:14.127
our guy was walking--
alone.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.929
Well, then--

13:15.963 --> 13:18.065
Oh, hang on.
What do we got here?

13:23.370 --> 13:25.805
Huh.
Somebody's water bottle.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.208
It looks like they've
been a lot of places.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.643
Yeah, kinda like
our backpacker.

13:32.245 --> 13:36.149
Didn't you say Sunny Barnes'
camp was somewhere around here?

13:36.183 --> 13:38.351
Yeah. Thinking we should
check in, give her an update.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.153
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.022
Oh, so you weren't--
you weren't at all thinking

13:42.055 --> 13:43.623
about spying
on your daughter?

13:43.656 --> 13:45.325
"Spy" is a harsh word. Mm.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.460
I mean, I'd just like to maybe
say hi, see how she's doing.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.029
Right. So, spying.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.098
Let's go spy
on my daughter. Yep.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.644
You gotta
let me out of here.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.313
Not until you tell me
who you really are.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.647
What are you
charging me with?

14:07.680 --> 14:08.982
I should be the one
pressing charges

14:09.016 --> 14:10.417
against this
doll-eyed psychopath.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.584
I don't have doll eyes!

14:14.854 --> 14:16.256
Brought you
some company!

14:16.289 --> 14:17.357
Picked up on
a drunk and disorderly

14:17.390 --> 14:18.825
a couple blocks
from here.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.029
Gonna let him...
sleep it off.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.133
Hopefully
he won't hurl on you.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.936
Be cool. Hands.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.770
Have fun.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.605
I'll come back when
you're ready to talk.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.109
Any luck
on his prints?

14:36.143 --> 14:37.577
Not yet.
Want me to try again?

14:37.610 --> 14:39.146
Get on it.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.026
Hey. You need
to let Donno go.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.928
He assaulted a man.
He was trying to help.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.096
Give me a break.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.797
Donno is
my business partner.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.299
Is that what you call him
these days?

14:59.332 --> 15:01.468
Yes.
Because that's what he is.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.304
Well, one day
I'm gonna put you

15:04.337 --> 15:06.806
and your business partner
behind bars.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.408
Well, what the fandango?

15:09.509 --> 15:10.910
Excuse me.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.445
Squatter's
not in the system.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.114
Squatter with
a bag full of cash,

15:14.147 --> 15:16.816
fake IDs, never been arrested?
Check again.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.596
Need help!
Hey! Stop!

15:42.875 --> 15:45.678
Mental kuzushi.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.647
Art of distraction.
You're welcome.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.582
Put your shirt
back on, please.

15:49.616 --> 15:50.717
Cuff him.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.421
That's not
just some drunk.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.822
You think?

15:55.855 --> 15:57.690
He-- He tried
to poison me!

15:57.724 --> 16:00.427
Which brings me back
to the same question.
Who the hell are you?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.195
And who wants you dead?

16:07.134 --> 16:08.135
Beau Arlen.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.037
Hey.
Sunny Barnes.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.805
So nice to finally meet
the new sheriff in town.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.641
This is my husband, Buck. Hey.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.643
We're getting ready to eat.
You guys hungry?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.711
Oh, that is mighty kind of you.
I could certainly eat.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.547
Thanks, but we won't be
staying long.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.318
We actually got a tip

16:25.352 --> 16:27.387
on that backpacker
I was telling you about.

16:27.420 --> 16:30.190
He was spotted heading up
Deadman's Drop six days ago.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.292
Sorry. We still
haven't seen him.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.561
Deadman's Drop. Huh.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.696
Sounds like a man
who wants to be left alone.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.898
Well, you'd think,
but turns out he wasn't.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.768
Yeah, we found <i>two</i> sets
of bootprints up there.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.706
And we found this.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.142
Oh, shoot.
Probably a dozen people

16:49.176 --> 16:51.544
up and down that trail
the past six days.

16:51.578 --> 16:55.548
Yeah. I mean, there are signs
everywhere. It's closed.

16:55.582 --> 16:59.252
Uh, truth is, a closed-off trail
won't stop anybody, really.

16:59.286 --> 17:02.322
I mean, like I said, just
some people want to disappear.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.523
Mm.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.325
Yeah, that is true.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.860
Then there's people
who <i>make</i> them disappear, so...

17:09.262 --> 17:10.697
We appreciate you
keeping an eye out.

17:10.730 --> 17:11.898
Dad.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.434
Hey, honey.

17:17.304 --> 17:20.107
I got
the whole tent to myself.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.444
Gonna have to get me
one of these.

17:24.477 --> 17:27.714
But, I mean, let's be honest.
It's not really camping, is it?

17:27.747 --> 17:29.516
You did not need to
come all the way out here

17:29.549 --> 17:30.850
just to check up on me.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.385
No, no, no.
I didn't, okay?

17:32.419 --> 17:34.387
I-- Well, maybe
not the only reason.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.189
We had to talk to Sunny
about a missing backpacker.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.690
It's something
Cassie's investigating.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.126
Wait. What?

17:39.159 --> 17:40.727
Well, I'm sure it's nothing.
It's, you know--

17:40.760 --> 17:42.129
Parents probably
didn't get the memo

17:42.162 --> 17:44.464
that "off the grid"
was part of the deal.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.466
Over-protective
parents, huh?

17:46.499 --> 17:47.900
Ugh. The worst. Hm.

17:47.934 --> 17:50.570
Well, I'm here. How are you?
You okay? You happy?

17:50.603 --> 17:52.339
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.442
Avery.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.444
What, are you--
are you checking up on us?

17:57.477 --> 17:59.379
No. No, no.
Just happened to be in the area

17:59.412 --> 18:01.047
on some official
Sheriff's business.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.216
Oh.
I don't mean to
infringe on your time.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.817
No.
Not at all.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.086
Ah. We're having
a lovely time.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.088
Um, we went on a beautiful hike
this morning.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.590
Uh, Emily's getting
some material

18:10.623 --> 18:11.958
for her podcast,
aren't you, Em?

18:11.991 --> 18:13.160
Yes.
Yes.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.463
It's my summer project.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.998
Oh.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.770
Well, looks like
you got everything handled.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.605
All geared up
and ready to rough it.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.106
Yes, well.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.476
Uh, I may have, uh--
may have overdone it.

18:29.509 --> 18:32.179
Eh, maybe. I'm more of
a boots-and-jeans kinda guy,

18:32.212 --> 18:33.446
but, hey,
to each their own.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.182
Daddy?
Yeah.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.516
Everything's fine.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.418
Seriously.
We're good.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.619
Really.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.155
Hey.
Ready to head out?

18:42.189 --> 18:43.823
Yeah. Yeah. Looks like
everything's taken care of.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.658
Avery's taking care
of it all.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.228
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:50.730 --> 18:51.831
All handled.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.634
Sweetheart, come here
for a second.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.205
So, maybe don't tell your mother
about this, okay?

18:58.238 --> 18:59.772
She's still on her trip.
No, I know.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.809
I just don't want her
thinking that, uh--

19:02.842 --> 19:04.777
Actually, you know what?
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.280
Just happy I got to see ya.
Come here.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.883
Okay.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.520
Okay.
Yeah.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.288
Alright.
Love ya.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.324
Avery.
Beau.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.400
What the hell?

19:27.434 --> 19:29.402
I turned around at the
campground, and you were gone.

19:29.436 --> 19:32.171
I just needed a minute.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.973
Hoping your cowboy lover
could follow you out here?

19:34.006 --> 19:36.142
I only flirt with Cormac
to mess with you.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.245
What? That's hilarious. Here
I am trying to make the best

19:38.278 --> 19:39.979
of this "seventh circle
from hell" vacation,

19:40.012 --> 19:41.648
and you're out here
making drama.

19:41.681 --> 19:45.051
Let's quit acting like this
is a vacation, alright?

19:46.219 --> 19:48.521
We both know
we are hiding out here

19:48.555 --> 19:51.258
until things blow over and
we can go back for the money.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.192
Okay, so we're back to
what a screw-up I am now?

19:55.962 --> 19:57.497
Let's just
get back to camp.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.609
Our fake-drunk's prints

20:09.642 --> 20:12.445
link him to Redmond
Aircraft Corporation.

20:12.479 --> 20:13.946
Security Engineer.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.449
Mm-hmm.
Try hired assassin.

20:16.483 --> 20:19.185
Thought he could poison our guy
and we'd be none the wiser.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.620
Thank God for Donno.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.389
Yeah, it was all him.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.893
Let's see who else
works at Redmond.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.131
Look at that.

20:32.164 --> 20:35.001
Our squatter's real name
is Paul Carlson.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.473
Let's go see why
they hired an assassin

20:40.507 --> 20:42.475
to kill
one of their own.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.444
Their new fleet
of passenger jets,

20:44.477 --> 20:46.446
a multibillion-dollar
contract,

20:46.479 --> 20:49.282
failed safety trials
over and over again,

20:49.316 --> 20:52.151
and Redmond
hid the reports.
You're a whistle-blower.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.321
If one of those engines
fails mid-flight--

20:54.354 --> 20:55.822
Hundreds of people
will die.

20:57.156 --> 21:00.159
So why aren't you
in protective custody,

21:00.192 --> 21:01.961
getting ready to testify
against them?

21:01.994 --> 21:04.497
I was supposed to be.

21:04.531 --> 21:05.765
But I got cold feet.

21:05.798 --> 21:09.135
So you ran.
That's it?

21:10.703 --> 21:13.840
You were gonna let
innocent people die

21:13.873 --> 21:15.274
'cause you're scared?

21:15.308 --> 21:17.777
Redmond is a huge,
powerful company,

21:17.810 --> 21:19.746
and I'm just one guy.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.281
I didn't think the government
could protect me.

21:22.315 --> 21:26.018
So how's that working out
for you, just one guy?

21:26.052 --> 21:28.588
Just fine
until you booked me.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.690
That sent up a red flag.
It's how they found me.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.258
They're a billion-dollar
cooperation.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.493
They would have
found you anyway.

21:33.526 --> 21:34.827
What do you want
from me?

21:34.861 --> 21:37.096
When do the planes
go into service?

21:37.129 --> 21:38.998
Two weeks.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.968
Then it's a good thing
I arrested you.

21:47.574 --> 21:50.510
So I leave you with
a basic squatter situation,

21:50.543 --> 21:52.845
and I come back
to a drunk assassin attack

21:52.879 --> 21:55.147
in our holding cell?
Pretty much.

21:55.181 --> 21:57.484
I hear he's still in
surgery. They're trying
to unscramble his face.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.619
I can explain. No.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.788
And our squatter turned out
to be a whistle-blower?

22:01.821 --> 22:04.657
We've got even more strange
doings at Redmond Aircraft.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.393
What do you got?

22:06.426 --> 22:08.795
The CEO's executive assistant
went missing two weeks ago.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.329
Huh.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.100
Where's our
whistle-blower now?

22:20.006 --> 22:21.474
It's not fair
to deny me...

22:21.508 --> 22:23.075
To remind-- Deny me.
Rem--

22:23.109 --> 22:25.077
...of the cross I bear...
Cross I bear...

22:25.111 --> 22:26.646
When you left...
...that you gave to--

22:26.679 --> 22:28.815
That you-- I thought
you meant the cross you bear

22:28.848 --> 22:30.149
that--
when you left me.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.984
Have y'all seen
our love birds?

22:32.018 --> 22:33.420
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.587
They missed check-in.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.989
Some of the other guests
are talking.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.091
They're probably just making up,
if you know what I mean.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.494
Well, I need you two
to go look for 'em

22:41.528 --> 22:42.729
before we lose daylight.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.163
Come on.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.868
Hey, guys. How ya doing?
Hey.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.437
Well, it looks like
Paige and Luke

22:50.470 --> 22:52.271
may have gotten
themselves lost.

22:52.304 --> 22:53.906
Don't worry about it, though.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.542
Buck and I have been
doing this a long time,

22:55.575 --> 22:57.209
and we always
find our strays.

22:57.243 --> 22:59.278
Isn't that right, Buck?
We sure do.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.448
Good news is they're together
and they're on foot,

23:01.481 --> 23:03.950
so they couldn't
have gotten very far.

23:03.983 --> 23:06.285
And I have my bloodhounds
on it.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.957
So, between the three of us,

23:10.990 --> 23:12.959
we'll have 'em rounded up
in no time!

23:16.262 --> 23:18.531
Things
are getting interesting.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.900
Oh, they probably
just had an argument.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.234
Yeah. I know.

23:22.268 --> 23:25.104
Why would they
even come here?

23:26.839 --> 23:29.375
Well, that is--

23:29.408 --> 23:31.043
That is a good question.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.719
I need a private jet,
a briefcase full of

23:39.752 --> 23:41.721
hundred-dollar bills,
and a real Canadian passport.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.790
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. T-That's your plan?

23:43.823 --> 23:46.626
You're gonna-- You're gonna
make a run for the border?

23:46.659 --> 23:49.796
I can take care of myself.
I have an insurance policy.

23:49.829 --> 23:52.632
You mean... evidence.
Something like that.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.467
Listen. It doesn't matter
what you have...

23:54.501 --> 23:56.402
and whether you're in Canada,
or whether you're in Mexico.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.170
As long as you're alive,

23:58.204 --> 24:00.573
they are never gonna stop
coming for you.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.742
What do you
want me to do?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.477
The government
can't protect me.

24:04.511 --> 24:06.345
You didn't give them
a chance.

24:06.378 --> 24:08.314
This company, Redmond,

24:08.347 --> 24:10.517
they've already made
one person disappear.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.520
Camille Perez, the CEO's
executive assistant.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.790
We know you're scared.

24:17.824 --> 24:20.693
But like it or not,
the safest place for you

24:20.727 --> 24:23.195
is in Witness Protection
with the U.S. Marshals.

24:24.731 --> 24:27.299
Hey.
You've got my word.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.802
We are not gonna let
anything happen to you.

24:34.406 --> 24:36.042
I thought I could
save lives, but--

24:36.075 --> 24:37.243
You still can.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.880
Let us make that call
for you.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.448
It's the only way.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.633
Now what?

25:00.667 --> 25:02.969
Uh, maybe we should have
made a left back there.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.337
Face it.
We're lost.

25:05.371 --> 25:06.973
Yeah.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.642
Well, i-if we stay put like
Sunny said, they'll find us.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.811
I don't care what she said.
I'm not gonna sit here

25:11.844 --> 25:13.813
and wait to be
some bear's amuse-bouche.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.651
Wait.
Did you see that?

25:18.685 --> 25:20.853
Hey! Hey! Over here!
Stop!

25:20.887 --> 25:23.823
We don't know who that is.
It could be another camper!

25:23.856 --> 25:25.357
We don't...

25:25.391 --> 25:26.593
I'm gonna go see.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.327
Wait.
Y-You can't go alone.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.597
You know what?

25:30.630 --> 25:32.164
I think I can.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.166
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

25:34.200 --> 25:36.903
It means I'm done
fixing your messes.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.938
Oh, my God. Relax, alright? All
this just 'cause I got us lost?

25:38.971 --> 25:42.274
No. Because <i>you're</i> lost, Luke.
You can't do anything right.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.510
Man, I'm so sick and tired of
always trying to please you.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.579
If it wasn't for me,
you would be in jail right now.

25:46.613 --> 25:49.015
And you whine
about your birthday.
Shut up.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.517
You're a little boy
pretending to be a man.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.952
I'm serious!
Shut up!

25:52.985 --> 25:55.321
Well, I'm not gonna let you
take me down with you.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.959
Really?

25:59.992 --> 26:02.328
So we're breaking up?

26:03.796 --> 26:06.132
What about the money?

26:06.165 --> 26:08.134
Guess what, genius?

26:08.167 --> 26:11.003
The money won't mean a thing
if we die out here.

26:12.338 --> 26:14.774
Good luck waiting for Mommy
to come find you.

26:14.807 --> 26:17.043
I said shut up!

26:22.782 --> 26:27.119
You ever touch me
like that again...

26:27.153 --> 26:28.587
I'll kill you.

27:01.553 --> 27:04.090
Hello? Paige? Luke?

27:46.232 --> 27:47.599
Hey.

27:50.236 --> 27:51.470
Paige?

27:51.503 --> 27:53.806
Hey.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.808
What are you doing
in Paige and Luke's tent?

27:55.842 --> 27:58.310
I walked into the wrong tent.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.812
They all look alike.

27:59.846 --> 28:03.716
Okay. Well, they still
haven't found them.

28:03.750 --> 28:07.553
Yes. Yes. I know.
Starting to get worried.

28:07.586 --> 28:09.555
Yeah. Me too.
We should all go look for them.

28:09.588 --> 28:10.723
Mm.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.326
You coming?

28:14.360 --> 28:16.929
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
Right behind you.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.606
Hey.
Good morning, everyone.

28:27.639 --> 28:32.278
Okay, so, we didn't find
Paige and Luke last night.

28:32.311 --> 28:35.114
So I called my good buddy,
Ranger Mike, and he's on it.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.850
Well, isn't there more that
we can do? They could be hurt.

28:37.884 --> 28:39.718
Okay. Let's not jump
to conclusions.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.287
Well, we need
to do something.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.622
Why don't we all go out
and look for them, too?

28:50.062 --> 28:52.198
Well, I was just gonna
make that suggestion,

28:52.231 --> 28:53.565
so thank you, Emily.

28:53.599 --> 28:55.968
So, for those of y'all
who wanna help,

28:56.002 --> 28:58.137
grab a partner and fan out.

28:58.170 --> 29:01.040
And for those of you
who don't want to,

29:01.073 --> 29:04.643
feel free to enjoy the hot
springs or just relax, okay?

29:04.676 --> 29:07.046
Y'all don't worry.
We <i>wil</i> find 'em.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.614
Let's go.

29:16.789 --> 29:18.624
Deputy Marshal Weaver.

29:18.657 --> 29:20.292
You must be
Sheriff Arlen.

29:20.326 --> 29:21.794
Hi, there.
This is Deputy Hoyt.

29:21.828 --> 29:23.495
We spoke on the phone.
Good to meet you.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.765
Oh. Yeah.
I'll go get our guy.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.937
May I see your creds?

29:30.970 --> 29:32.338
Of course.

29:36.642 --> 29:38.444
I'll, uh--
I'll call your office.

29:38.477 --> 29:41.080
Who knows? You could be
pretending to be a Fed.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.915
If you think
that's necessary.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.650
Oh, you'd be surprised.

29:44.683 --> 29:45.918
Just a formality.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.653
Can I get you anything
while we wait?

29:47.686 --> 29:49.621
Coffee's terrible,
but hot.

29:49.655 --> 29:51.123
No thanks.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.861
Good news. There's
a U.S. Marshal here for ya.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.563
Marshal?
They only sent one?

29:58.730 --> 30:00.332
This is how
you protect me?

30:00.366 --> 30:02.468
Don't worry.
We got you.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.370
Like you did
with the drunk?

30:04.403 --> 30:06.172
Live and learn, right?

30:06.205 --> 30:07.773
Now let's go.

30:09.241 --> 30:12.311
Well, thanks for letting me
cross my T's. Alright.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.413
Good to go?
Good to go.

30:16.215 --> 30:19.118
Paul, Deputy Weaver here
is gonna take you to the airport

30:19.151 --> 30:20.953
and get you into
protective custody.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.454
You sure you don't
want an escort?

30:22.488 --> 30:23.990
I can easily have
one of my guys follow you.

30:24.023 --> 30:26.025
All due respect, Sheriff,
not my first rodeo.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.527
Okay. Well, it looks like
you're in good hands.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.533
Hey. Be safe.

30:34.566 --> 30:37.403
Thank you. I think.

30:47.213 --> 30:48.915
You think
this is overkill?

30:48.948 --> 30:50.749
You <i>did</i> call it in.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.318
Well, promised the guy

30:52.351 --> 30:55.387
I wouldn't let anything
happen to him, so...

30:55.421 --> 30:56.923
We both did.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.594
Thinking
this is overkill.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.663
Okay. You know what?
Just follow 'em, Pop Star.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.433
And don't follow too close.
She didn't want an escort.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.435
I doubt she'll make me
in my mom's minivan.

31:09.468 --> 31:12.438
Yeah.
We need to up your car game.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.755
There it is.

31:29.788 --> 31:32.024
It's the same bottle!

31:37.563 --> 31:40.432
This is Mark's
water bottle.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.134
He posted this
from the Basin Trailhead

31:42.168 --> 31:44.470
the same day
the girls saw him.

31:44.503 --> 31:45.938
Hmm.

31:45.972 --> 31:48.640
Something happened to him
up at Deadman's Drop.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.442
Well, maybe now my theory

31:50.476 --> 31:53.212
about the Bleeding Heart Murder
isn't such a stretch.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.746
Well, I'm not saying that.

31:54.780 --> 31:56.582
You know,
I didn't tell you,

31:56.615 --> 31:59.585
but that girl's body was found
at Deadman's Drop.

32:01.187 --> 32:04.223
And they never did catch
her killer.

32:04.256 --> 32:07.559
They think he was linked
to other killings.

32:09.661 --> 32:12.131
I mean,
it was 20 years ago? I--

32:12.164 --> 32:14.466
Yeah.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.335
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

32:17.536 --> 32:20.339
Ugh. I gotta
go get Kai to camp.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.976
See ya. Yeah.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.146
Hey.
How we looking, Pop?

32:27.179 --> 32:28.447
They're on their way
to the airport

32:28.480 --> 32:29.781
just like
they're supposed to be.

32:29.815 --> 32:31.583
Any suspicious cars
following?

32:31.617 --> 32:33.785
What does a suspicious car
look like?

32:33.819 --> 32:35.321
You'll know it
when you see it.

32:36.855 --> 32:38.957
Hold on.
<i>What do ya got?</i>

32:38.991 --> 32:40.659
They just missed the turnoff
to the airport.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.128
<i>Maybe she just doesn't know
where she's going.</i>

32:42.161 --> 32:43.529
She said it's not
her first rodeo.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.197
She knows <i>exactly</i>
where she's going.

32:45.231 --> 32:47.166
So are we thinking that they
actually turned a U.S. Marshal

32:47.199 --> 32:48.634
and that she's gonna
take out Paul?

32:48.667 --> 32:50.336
With this case,
anything is possible.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.671
They just turned north
on Route 21.

32:53.872 --> 32:55.641
Tonya's property.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.343
Okay, he said that he had
an insurance policy,

32:57.376 --> 32:59.045
some piece of evidence.
I bet it's at that house.

32:59.078 --> 33:01.313
Pop, stay with 'em.
We're on our way.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.848
You got it.

33:16.862 --> 33:18.130
Walter.

33:21.933 --> 33:23.135
Walt.

33:23.169 --> 33:25.904
Come out now.

33:25.937 --> 33:28.040
Walter.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.589
Walter, please come out.

33:52.964 --> 33:54.933
Luke? Paige?

34:00.472 --> 34:01.707
Cormac.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.542
Come here.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.878
Keep a tight rein
on 'em, buddy.

34:06.912 --> 34:09.181
Last thing we need
is a sprained ankle

34:09.215 --> 34:11.016
or a poison-oak flare-up.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.618
I can't babysit 'em all.

34:12.651 --> 34:14.453
We shouldn't have
let them split up.

34:14.486 --> 34:16.622
Well, that toothpaste is out
of the tube now, isn't it?

34:16.655 --> 34:18.056
Just get it done.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.291
I'll check down this way.

34:19.325 --> 34:21.693
It's okay.
It's not necessary.

34:21.727 --> 34:23.695
Already walked it.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.231
You find anything?

34:25.264 --> 34:28.500
Nothing but dirt and sky
as far as these eyes can tell.

34:30.836 --> 34:33.805
Ranger Mike gonna get a real
search and rescue going?

34:33.839 --> 34:35.807
No, I don't think that's
necessary. We can find 'em.

34:35.841 --> 34:38.977
When we do, we can
go back to having fun.

34:39.010 --> 34:41.313
Might want to put
some extra tequila

34:41.347 --> 34:43.782
in their campfire
margaritas tonight.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.317
That simple, huh?

34:49.155 --> 34:51.157
Why can't you just do
what I tell you to do?

34:51.190 --> 34:52.491
Is it that hard?

34:52.524 --> 34:55.161
Bad enough I've got
missing lovers

34:55.194 --> 34:58.797
and a mutiny of campers
just roaming all over the woods!

34:58.830 --> 35:00.966
You're a grown man, Cormac!

35:00.999 --> 35:02.934
Start acting like it!

35:42.007 --> 35:45.511
Where is it?
Just give me what I want.

35:45.544 --> 35:46.778
I can't do that.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.680
Are you willing
to die for this?

35:48.714 --> 35:50.015
Please. You don't
have to do this.
Shut up.

35:50.048 --> 35:52.017
Just let me disappear.
Drop the gun!

35:54.186 --> 35:56.522
Lower your weapon now.

35:56.555 --> 35:57.989
Back off.

35:59.325 --> 36:01.993
You don't have to do this, Weaver.

36:02.027 --> 36:03.762
It's not worth the money.

36:44.370 --> 36:45.571
Beau.

36:46.638 --> 36:47.673
You got this?

36:47.706 --> 36:49.275
Yeah, go.
Cuff her.

37:02.087 --> 37:04.423
I think we found
Camille Perez.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.292
The missing assistant.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.459
Camille.

37:07.493 --> 37:10.061
I'm okay.
I'm-- I'm okay.

37:10.095 --> 37:12.898
Let me guess.
Your insurance policy.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.466
She's gonna corroborate
my story,

37:14.500 --> 37:15.734
take Redmond down together.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.337
We can. We will.

37:24.276 --> 37:26.812
Em, you know,
it's getting late.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.780
I think we should head back.
Yeah, it's <i>really</i> late.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.115
I'm officially worried
about them.

37:30.148 --> 37:33.585
Yeah, uh, just remember
what Sunny said.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.487
Don't jump
to any conclusions.

37:35.521 --> 37:37.155
Okay, but--

37:37.188 --> 37:39.124
Besides, they might
be back at camp already.

37:39.157 --> 37:40.459
And I need the toilet.
Come on.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.160
Just use one of the trees.

37:42.193 --> 37:43.795
The <i>other</i> toilet.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.399
Okay. TMI.

37:47.433 --> 37:50.569
Look. There's just one more
trail that I want to check out.

37:50.602 --> 37:53.071
Fine.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.073
It's alright. I'll just--
I'll be right there.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.274
You sure?
Yeah, it's fine.

37:56.308 --> 37:57.809
Alright.
Em, do you want my water?

37:57.843 --> 37:59.978
No, I'm good.
You go ahead.

38:09.521 --> 38:10.656
Hey!
Hello!

38:10.689 --> 38:12.123
Hey!

38:12.157 --> 38:13.359
Wow!
Yes. Yes.

38:13.392 --> 38:14.760
Whoo!
Nice.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.028
Congratulations,
homeowner!

38:17.062 --> 38:18.864
- Welcome. Welcome to the abode.
- Wow.

38:18.897 --> 38:21.600
Oh. So, uh...
you never go hungry, huh?

38:21.633 --> 38:23.268
Bread?

38:23.301 --> 38:25.371
And you're, uh, always protected.

38:26.505 --> 38:27.973
Oh, from demons.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.641
How traditional of you.

38:29.675 --> 38:33.278
And... so you've always
got a little fun.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.646
Ah. Tequila.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.015
Uh, thanks, guys. Mm.

38:38.083 --> 38:40.386
Nice.
It's nice, right?

38:54.199 --> 38:55.634
Okay.
What are we cheersing to?

38:55.667 --> 38:57.803
Here's to blackmailing Tonya
for this place.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.205
Here's to Tonya
actually going aboveboard.

39:00.238 --> 39:02.307
"Legitimate businesswoman,"
my ass.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.342
Wait, wait.
Now here's to Tonya's squatter,

39:04.376 --> 39:06.144
safe and sound
in protective custody

39:06.177 --> 39:07.846
and ready to do
the right thing.

39:07.879 --> 39:09.548
Because of us.
That's right.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.316
Sounds like
you two had a day.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.885
Yeah.
Getting to be a thing.

39:13.919 --> 39:16.888
Hey, um, any progress
on the backpacker?

39:16.922 --> 39:20.158
Yeah. We confirmed the water
bottle we found belonged to him.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.461
So he was
definitely up there?
Yeah.

39:23.895 --> 39:27.165
And there's this old case--

39:27.198 --> 39:29.668
this girl
found 20 years ago

39:29.701 --> 39:32.738
in the same place
with her heart cut out.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.139
I...

39:35.774 --> 39:37.609
I remember that.

39:37.643 --> 39:39.611
I think I was heading
to college at that time.

39:39.645 --> 39:41.379
I'm sorry. What?

39:41.413 --> 39:43.014
Emily's up in those woods.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.616
Beau, I--

39:44.650 --> 39:46.752
I would have said something
if I thought you should worry.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.457
Still, might be a good time
to check in with her.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.128
And, no, I'm not spying.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.230
Ye-- Hey, you don't
wanna scare her.

39:59.264 --> 40:02.468
No, no.
Just a-- a little...

40:02.501 --> 40:04.936
"Hey, I miss ya, love, Dad"
kinda thing.

40:36.367 --> 40:38.269
Not delivered.

40:41.339 --> 40:43.575
Ah, I guess she doesn't have
any service.

41:44.002 --> 41:47.706
