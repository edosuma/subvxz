WEBVTT

04:28.603 --> 04:30.370
Oh, sh... shit!

05:04.071 --> 05:05.907
You are, uh, nervous.

05:08.109 --> 05:09.510
It's okay.

05:09.544 --> 05:12.379
When I first saw you,
I said to myself,

05:12.412 --> 05:14.582
"This is a man that knows
what he wants."

05:17.585 --> 05:20.087
He's just, uh, afraid.

05:20.121 --> 05:21.698
Well, I'm not afraid,
it's just that I...

05:21.722 --> 05:24.725
I know, I know,
It... it is just the way...

05:24.759 --> 05:27.094
things are.

05:27.128 --> 05:30.097
But a man must pay
to get what he wants.

05:30.131 --> 05:31.464
Hmm?

05:34.769 --> 05:38.539
That is why...
we're all here, yes?

05:45.112 --> 05:46.547
Yeah.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.855
Go talk to her.

05:55.890 --> 05:57.457
Come on.

05:58.491 --> 06:01.062
She's very sweet.

06:01.095 --> 06:02.697
You'll see.

06:23.918 --> 06:24.918
Beatriz!

06:34.962 --> 06:36.030
<i>Hola.</i>

06:36.063 --> 06:37.531
Hi.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.469
You wanna show me
what you're drawing?

06:43.204 --> 06:45.506
I'd rather not.

06:53.147 --> 06:54.882
It's Beatriz, right?

06:58.052 --> 06:59.052
Bedroom.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.069
Ah, li... listen, why, wh...
Why don't we just talk first?

07:15.102 --> 07:16.504
Okay?

07:16.537 --> 07:18.115
You don't want to waste
time with talking.

07:18.139 --> 07:20.074
It's okay.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.809
H... how old are you?

07:21.842 --> 07:23.077
How old do you like?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.612
No, that's not what I meant.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.580
I just want to get to know you,

07:26.614 --> 07:27.891
g... g... get to know who you are.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.617
- You like thirteen?
- Come on, no, please!

07:29.650 --> 07:31.519
- Twelve?
- No.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.558
Shit!

07:38.592 --> 07:40.061
Papa! Papa!

07:49.870 --> 07:52.974
FBI! Drop the gun
right now, asshole! Drop it!

07:54.542 --> 07:56.043
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you too, pal!

07:56.077 --> 07:58.212
- I die, she dies.
- Hey, Leon!

08:08.656 --> 08:09.857
Put the gun down. Put it down!

08:09.890 --> 08:11.268
Nobody said anything
about going back.

08:11.292 --> 08:12.994
We can talk about all that,

08:13.027 --> 08:14.595
when everybody's safe, okay?

08:14.628 --> 08:16.731
You've lied! You all lied!

08:16.764 --> 08:19.567
You don't want to hurt her, man.
She's your daughter.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.003
- Okay? She needs you.
- You don't know shit.

08:22.036 --> 08:23.604
I know you don't want this.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.007
None of us wants this, okay?

08:26.040 --> 08:27.274
Come on, you're a father.

08:27.308 --> 08:29.276
Put the gun down.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.018
Papa! Papa!

08:39.320 --> 08:40.955
Papa!

08:40.988 --> 08:42.155
Papa!

08:42.188 --> 08:43.624
- Let go of me!
- Beatriz, no.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.726
- Come on, get back!
- Papa! Papa!

08:45.760 --> 08:47.828
- Get her back!
- Let go!

08:47.862 --> 08:49.130
Papa!

08:49.163 --> 08:50.163
Let go!

09:03.077 --> 09:04.078
Papa Leon?

09:06.080 --> 09:07.648
Yeah, I, uh...

09:07.681 --> 09:09.984
Hold on, Serra, I wanna
make sure I'm clear on this.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.086
The lynchpin, the key
to your whole investigation

09:12.119 --> 09:14.197
is laying in a meat wagon
with his brains smashed in?

09:14.221 --> 09:17.058
Vincent saved lives, sir.
The fucker was going out messy.

09:17.091 --> 09:18.659
I don't care, Amistead.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.861
What I care about,
is an eleven month investigation

09:20.895 --> 09:22.663
that has taken
considerable resources

09:22.696 --> 09:23.998
on both sides of the border.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.834
- Is now well and truly fucked.
- Not necessarily.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.769
Don't add insult to injury.

09:28.803 --> 09:30.671
An undocumented child
is not something

09:30.704 --> 09:32.306
we build a trafficking case on.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.075
Well, what the fuck is?

09:34.108 --> 09:35.242
Sir.

09:35.276 --> 09:36.677
We'll talk in the morning.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.072
Mauricio.

10:40.174 --> 10:42.376
Alex!

10:44.178 --> 10:46.380
What's this? What's this?

10:50.751 --> 10:53.154
Oh, my God, has she grown!

10:53.187 --> 10:54.855
- Hmm.
- What a sweet kid!

10:54.889 --> 10:59.160
Ah, Pinches horses... expensive.

10:59.193 --> 11:01.395
- Less than a divorce, I guess.
- Yeah!

11:05.199 --> 11:07.301
Nice work in Guadalajara.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.037
That city is a fucking shithole.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.338
Same as here.

11:11.372 --> 11:13.007
I hate cities, the crowds,

11:13.040 --> 11:15.176
the smells, the fucking <i>gueros.</i>

11:16.477 --> 11:19.046
- No offence.
- None taken.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.282
Country's better now,
don't you think?

11:21.315 --> 11:23.317
Remember Tamalpais?

11:23.350 --> 11:26.320
Those were Zeta scumbags.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.756
Crazy days. Fun though, huh?

11:28.789 --> 11:31.458
Uh, not exactly my idea
of fun, Mauricio.

11:31.492 --> 11:33.727
Right...

11:33.761 --> 11:36.130
You're sensitive. An <i>artista.</i>

11:36.163 --> 11:38.432
Jesus. Cheer up!

11:38.465 --> 11:40.334
Life is good now. It's calmer.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.969
More money, less blood.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.773
Our friends got you
something nice.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.377
Mauri, you want someone else.

11:50.411 --> 11:52.446
I'm not up for it right now.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.014
Get up for it.

11:54.048 --> 11:56.083
Job's in El Paso.
You're from there, right?

11:56.116 --> 11:58.485
Another reason to say no.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.121
I'm trying to tell you,
I'm getting out.

12:10.931 --> 12:14.201
Uh, an iced tea, <i>por favor.</i>

12:22.276 --> 12:23.844
The fuck?

12:24.445 --> 12:25.946
You drunk?

12:28.449 --> 12:31.085
U... uh, no, no, just tired.

12:32.286 --> 12:35.523
Alex. I need you on this.

12:35.557 --> 12:37.157
You know the town.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.263
It's too much.

12:42.296 --> 12:44.031
The job is for two.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.334
Don't you have
a brother in El Paso?

12:51.872 --> 12:54.174
Mauri...

12:55.976 --> 12:57.545
Are you spying on me?

12:57.579 --> 12:59.913
It's our job
to know things, Alex.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.883
So stop talking this
retirement shit.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.754
Men like us don't retire.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.518
Here you go
Mr. Marshall, you're all set.

14:10.552 --> 14:13.153
Anything else I can do for you?

14:13.187 --> 14:14.188
Mr. Marshall?

14:18.392 --> 14:20.861
No, no, thank you. I'm fine.

14:21.696 --> 14:23.230
The room number again?

14:23.263 --> 14:25.466
11-0-6. It's on the key holder.

14:25.499 --> 14:28.268
Ah, yes. Thank you.

15:04.438 --> 15:06.039
Vodka Martini, please.

15:08.442 --> 15:11.412
So, too early in the day
for a glass of wine?

15:11.445 --> 15:13.681
Or too late for a Bloody Mary?

15:13.715 --> 15:15.583
Guess that depends
on what kind of day

15:15.617 --> 15:17.017
you wanna have.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.653
That's up to you, isn't it?

15:24.458 --> 15:25.560
Are you alone?

15:25.593 --> 15:27.294
Not right now.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.630
Excuse me.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.304
- Pleasant trip?
- Let's get on with it.

15:42.677 --> 15:44.311
Uh, yes, he's here.

15:45.713 --> 15:48.382
He looks like what you'd expect.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.083
I'm sure he'll be fine.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.953
Alright. Bye now.

16:01.228 --> 16:03.330
Your people said
this will be done quickly.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.032
And it will.

16:06.501 --> 16:09.002
I'm gonna need a little more
specificity than that.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.705
No, you won't.

16:10.738 --> 16:12.507
The less you know, the better.

17:21.576 --> 17:22.676
I was trying to save him.

17:22.710 --> 17:24.411
You are a liar.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.580
Look, Beatriz,
what happened to you.

17:26.614 --> 17:29.216
What Papa did, it ain't right.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.518
Now, it's not your fault.

17:30.552 --> 17:32.095
- No child should be treated...
- Papa said...

17:32.119 --> 17:34.656
"It is how you pay to be free."

17:34.689 --> 17:36.624
It was better than here.

17:42.396 --> 17:44.599
- I brought you these.
- I don't want them!

17:50.137 --> 17:51.371
Listen, there is, uh,

17:51.405 --> 17:54.174
a special visa for...
people like you

17:54.207 --> 17:55.886
to stay in the US,
while we're working on your...

17:55.910 --> 17:57.277
You want me to tell.

17:57.311 --> 17:59.313
It's wrong that you're
locked up here

17:59.346 --> 18:01.315
while the men who did
things to you are out there.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.817
Papa said to never tell.

18:08.890 --> 18:10.290
I'm gonna have you transferred

18:10.324 --> 18:13.160
to Child Protective Services,
okay?

18:13.193 --> 18:15.597
They'll put you in a group home.
Not lock you up.

18:15.630 --> 18:17.865
Now, I don't expect anything
in return.

18:17.899 --> 18:19.433
Okay, if you wanna talk,
you can talk.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.234
If you don't wanna,
you don't have to.

18:36.884 --> 18:39.621
Looks like I'm going solo
tonight.

18:39.654 --> 18:41.421
I gotta get this done.

18:41.455 --> 18:44.157
I've got a permit filing
downtown.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.426
- Downtown?
- Yeah, I work, Wendy.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.896
Contracts don't just
jump in the boat.

18:48.930 --> 18:51.899
- Don't wait up for me.
- Ellis?

18:51.933 --> 18:55.637
- Yeah?
- Her perfume fucking stinks.

18:55.670 --> 18:58.606
Wash it off before you
come home, will you?

19:15.723 --> 19:17.357
Oh, shit!

19:22.764 --> 19:24.431
Please!

19:25.566 --> 19:27.334
- Please!
- You know why I'm here!

19:27.367 --> 19:28.836
It's... it's all
a misunderstanding.

19:28.870 --> 19:30.605
It's always a misunderstanding.

19:30.638 --> 19:31.839
- M... Please!
- Where?

19:33.641 --> 19:36.276
It's... it's in the safe.
Upstairs. Please!

19:36.309 --> 19:37.645
Don't do this!

19:37.679 --> 19:41.248
I didn't, I didn't
say anything, alright?

19:41.281 --> 19:42.960
It wasn't, it wasn't
supposed to go this far.

19:42.984 --> 19:45.385
If I'm here, it's gone too far.

19:45.419 --> 19:48.221
It's here, alright! Okay!

19:48.255 --> 19:49.824
- Okay.
- Open it!

19:49.857 --> 19:51.893
Alright, I just... Okay.

20:00.001 --> 20:01.736
Look, if I give it to you...

20:01.769 --> 20:03.403
- Come on!
- Alright.

20:05.873 --> 20:07.842
Oh, Dad? You home?

20:09.376 --> 20:10.978
I'm going over to Annabelle's.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.583
I'll probably stay over, okay?

20:17.284 --> 20:19.286
Just letting you know.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.943
Maybe you want to do that later.

21:48.976 --> 21:50.477
Uh-huh, I'm multi-tasking.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.048
Yeah, well I just
don't wanna die today.

21:58.385 --> 22:00.265
How can you live in Texas
and not speak Spanish?

22:04.625 --> 22:05.626
Fucking owl!

22:15.002 --> 22:17.138
Hey, Danny. Where is he?

22:17.171 --> 22:19.439
Besides stomping
all over my crime scene?

22:19.472 --> 22:20.541
He's out there.

22:31.586 --> 22:34.622
Agent Serra, Agent Amistead,
this is Mrs. Van Camp.

22:38.159 --> 22:42.096
Wendy, I guarantee
these are two of my best.

22:42.129 --> 22:44.431
Just tell them what you told me.

22:46.667 --> 22:47.768
Ellis was...

22:48.970 --> 22:50.872
It was a robbery.

22:50.905 --> 22:52.607
The safe was opened.

22:52.640 --> 22:55.576
And you've told this
to Detective Mora?

22:55.610 --> 22:57.879
I haven't talked to the police.

22:57.912 --> 22:59.780
I called Gerald first.

23:03.517 --> 23:05.920
Well, I'm... I'm sure
Special Agent Nussbaum

23:05.953 --> 23:07.889
has made it clear to you,
the more people we have

23:07.922 --> 23:09.590
working on this early on...

23:09.624 --> 23:11.158
the better our chances
of solving it.

23:11.192 --> 23:13.460
Uh, so, I'm gonna go get
Detective Mora,

23:13.493 --> 23:15.863
just so you don't have
to repeat yourself.

23:15.897 --> 23:16.898
Excuse me.

23:22.536 --> 23:24.538
You wanna come outside
and take her statement?

23:25.773 --> 23:27.975
So...

23:28.009 --> 23:30.511
your boss trying to get some
or is he already getting it?

23:30.544 --> 23:31.779
That's real nice, Mora.

23:31.812 --> 23:34.015
Sexualizing the wife
of a murder victim.

23:34.048 --> 23:35.149
No one asked for you guys.

23:35.182 --> 23:36.617
He just parachuted in on this.

23:36.651 --> 23:37.928
Yeah, couldn't agree
with you more.

23:37.952 --> 23:39.452
This is your investigation.

23:39.486 --> 23:40.731
But let's just do this, together

23:40.755 --> 23:42.657
and then I'll get Nussbaum
off your back.

23:43.691 --> 23:44.959
I don't need to cut a deal.

23:44.992 --> 23:48.029
Can you just not be an asshole
all the time?

23:48.062 --> 23:50.064
Just say "yes", Danny.

23:50.097 --> 23:51.966
- Yes, Danny.
- Okay, let's go.

23:57.705 --> 24:00.641
Mrs. Van Camp,
this is Detective Danny Mora.

24:01.509 --> 24:04.477
Sorry for your loss, ma'am.

24:04.512 --> 24:06.514
When's the last time
you saw your husband alive?

24:06.547 --> 24:09.482
Last night... around 9:00.

24:09.517 --> 24:11.652
I... I was going
to an art opening.

24:12.586 --> 24:14.956
And Ellis was...

24:14.989 --> 24:17.792
He was going to file permits.

24:17.825 --> 24:21.494
Sounds like your husband
had something on the side.

24:21.529 --> 24:26.233
I assumed that he was,
um, meeting a friend.

24:26.267 --> 24:28.869
- You have her number, or his...
- Linda.

24:28.903 --> 24:32.073
Let's have Agent Serra
continue the interview.

24:32.106 --> 24:34.041
I can get you her number.

24:34.075 --> 24:35.843
Thank you, ma'am.

24:35.876 --> 24:37.678
You have any business dealings

24:37.712 --> 24:40.715
that went bad, anyone you know
might wanna hurt him?

24:40.748 --> 24:42.750
Uh, I... I... I don't know.

24:45.286 --> 24:47.487
Please help me!

24:49.290 --> 24:51.491
What am I gonna say to Em?

25:03.070 --> 25:04.672
Don't expect too much.

25:04.705 --> 25:06.640
When the onset of Alzheimer's
is this sudden...

25:06.674 --> 25:08.709
I know how it starts.

25:16.784 --> 25:18.619
Hey, pal.

25:18.652 --> 25:22.023
It's me, Alex, your brother.

25:22.056 --> 25:23.724
You're looking good.

25:25.926 --> 25:27.628
Guess what?

25:27.661 --> 25:29.830
I found this the other day.

25:29.864 --> 25:33.601
1969. Made me think of you.

25:33.634 --> 25:37.071
You remember that year?
Huh? The draft?

25:37.104 --> 25:38.773
The Suns and the Bucks.

25:38.806 --> 25:41.942
Both tied
for the First Round Pick.

25:41.976 --> 25:45.646
Down to a coin flip...
Phoenix calls heads.

25:48.682 --> 25:50.885
Yeah, it was tails.

25:50.918 --> 25:53.754
And the goddamn Bucks
get Lew Alcindor.

25:57.324 --> 26:00.961
Yeah, I don't watch
basketball much anymore.

26:03.831 --> 26:06.767
Can't say I remember
the last time I did.

26:54.849 --> 26:56.984
My Captain called this morning.

26:57.017 --> 26:58.819
Apparently,
I'm no longer needed.

26:58.853 --> 27:00.754
Good, I'm glad everybody's here.

27:00.788 --> 27:03.657
So... in light of what happened
with the Papa Leon raid

27:03.691 --> 27:05.960
the Task Force
is being reorganized.

27:05.993 --> 27:08.229
Detective Marquez will be
heading back to Mexico.

27:08.262 --> 27:09.396
We're not done, sir.

27:09.430 --> 27:11.007
Cooperation with
the Mexican Police has...

27:11.031 --> 27:13.267
We're done, Serra,
I've spent the last three days

27:13.300 --> 27:16.170
getting an earful from
Washington, facts are facts.

27:16.203 --> 27:18.672
This has been a wide reaching
international investigation

27:18.706 --> 27:20.374
and we got nothing
to show for it.

27:22.476 --> 27:24.054
You have something
you wanna say, Marquez?

27:24.078 --> 27:25.880
It's not nothing, sir.

27:25.913 --> 27:27.281
We've gotten plenty in Mexico.

27:29.216 --> 27:33.020
But as soon as we come
into the US, things get, uh...

27:33.053 --> 27:35.156
I don't know, maybe your ears
in Washington

27:35.189 --> 27:37.158
just don't wanna hear.

27:38.993 --> 27:41.262
It's pretty obvious
the appetite for big fish,

27:41.295 --> 27:42.763
ends at the border.

27:42.796 --> 27:44.074
I don't like what
you're insinuating, Marquez.

27:44.098 --> 27:46.901
I don't think I was
insinuating anything.

27:46.934 --> 27:48.302
Was saying it pretty flat out.

27:48.335 --> 27:50.037
Hugo has a point, sir.

27:50.070 --> 27:52.182
We've never gotten anywhere
with the US-based <i>Padrote.</i>

27:52.206 --> 27:53.774
If there even is such a thing.

27:53.807 --> 27:57.077
The word was Papa Leon served
rich men. White men.

27:57.111 --> 27:58.746
"The Word," is that
what you people

27:58.779 --> 28:00.181
build cases on in Juarez?

28:00.214 --> 28:01.415
We have Papa Leon on tape

28:01.448 --> 28:02.850
bragging about his clientele.

28:02.883 --> 28:05.186
Look, I know you take
this personally.

28:05.219 --> 28:07.021
But the well's gone dry.

28:10.357 --> 28:12.469
I know you don't want to believe
there's a white <i>Padrote,</i>

28:12.493 --> 28:14.104
but shutting down a case
don't make it so.

28:14.128 --> 28:16.063
- Watch yourself, Serra.
- We have a witness.

28:16.096 --> 28:17.765
What we have...

28:17.798 --> 28:19.109
is an undocumented minor
in detention.

28:19.133 --> 28:21.068
What we have
is a severely traumatized,

28:21.101 --> 28:23.170
undocumented minor in detention.

28:23.204 --> 28:25.072
And she's the only
valuable witness we have.

28:25.105 --> 28:26.449
When were you gonna
tell me you offered.

28:26.473 --> 28:28.709
Beatriz Leon a T-1 visa?

28:29.376 --> 28:30.411
I was coming to that.

28:30.444 --> 28:31.445
To notify me of the deal

28:31.478 --> 28:33.080
you're not authorized to make?

28:33.113 --> 28:34.882
With a witness in
a case you haven't made?

28:34.915 --> 28:36.518
I thought helping kids
like Beatriz Leon

28:36.551 --> 28:38.085
was part of our job.

28:38.118 --> 28:40.854
- She's eligible.
- The Task Force is done.

28:40.888 --> 28:43.057
And that is straight
from Washington.

28:43.090 --> 28:45.826
As for Beatriz, we can T-1 her
and move her to a group home,

28:45.859 --> 28:48.229
but you need to focus
on the Van Camp murder.

28:48.262 --> 28:50.030
That's El Paso PD, every day.

28:50.064 --> 28:52.766
You want to help a kid
like Beatriz?

28:52.800 --> 28:54.268
You play ball on the homicide.

28:58.372 --> 29:00.241
Yeah, okay.

29:03.277 --> 29:04.378
Thank you, sir.

29:04.411 --> 29:06.247
Good.

29:06.280 --> 29:07.881
Coleman, Howe.

29:07.915 --> 29:09.950
You'll have new
duty assignments this week.

29:09.984 --> 29:11.852
Detective Marquez,
on behalf of the Bureau

29:11.885 --> 29:14.321
and the United States,
I thank you for your service.

30:37.338 --> 30:40.074
I saw the paperwork,
is she a witness or victim?

30:40.107 --> 30:41.175
Both.

30:41.208 --> 30:42.943
I'll reach out
to Social Services,

30:42.976 --> 30:45.346
see what we can do
about counseling and school.

30:45.379 --> 30:46.880
That would be great.

30:46.914 --> 30:48.091
Is there any family
on either side

30:48.115 --> 30:49.983
of the border
I should know about?

30:50.017 --> 30:52.486
No, the father was a trafficker.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.088
- Hm.
- I'm gonna say goodbye.

30:54.121 --> 30:55.856
I'll keep you posted.

31:02.296 --> 31:04.198
I think you're
gonna be okay here.

31:05.667 --> 31:08.235
You asked me before, at Papa's,

31:08.268 --> 31:09.937
what I was drawing.

31:11.539 --> 31:13.941
It is a desert.

31:13.974 --> 31:15.976
I draw deserts.

31:16.009 --> 31:18.646
So you do, look at that.

31:20.414 --> 31:21.415
Keep it.

31:28.155 --> 31:30.924
I'll come back
to see you soon, okay?

31:30.958 --> 31:32.493
I promise you.

33:37.652 --> 33:40.420
For fuck's sake.

33:49.429 --> 33:50.798
She's a child.

33:50.832 --> 33:53.100
- And that's a problem?
- I won't do it.

33:53.133 --> 33:55.102
Your people knew
who the contract was for.

33:55.135 --> 33:57.572
I fucking won't do it.
Are you deaf?

33:57.605 --> 33:59.373
Well, maybe
I'll call Mexico City,

33:59.406 --> 34:00.684
see what they
have to say about that.

34:00.708 --> 34:02.276
No, no.

34:03.443 --> 34:06.280
No, you're gonna call
the contract off.

34:06.313 --> 34:08.282
The fuck I am.

34:08.315 --> 34:10.552
You're an employee!
I don't take fucking...

34:18.257 --> 34:20.828
You want this? Huh?

34:20.862 --> 34:22.630
You call the contract off.

34:22.664 --> 34:25.299
You really don't know
what you're playing with.

34:29.871 --> 34:31.773
Oh, yes, I do.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.844
Mr. Borden.

34:37.879 --> 34:42.416
Of 22 Bienveneda Avenue,
Silver Springs.

34:44.619 --> 34:46.219
The girl stays alive.

34:46.888 --> 34:49.322
Or you're answerable to me.

34:49.356 --> 34:50.489
Asshole.

35:03.771 --> 35:07.609
No, no speeches or awards,
please.

35:07.642 --> 35:09.544
My donation isn't about me.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.182
Yes, you are correct.

35:15.215 --> 35:17.351
That is the amount
I'm prepared to give,

35:17.384 --> 35:19.621
however any construction funding

35:19.654 --> 35:22.389
by this donation cannot be named.

35:22.422 --> 35:24.224
"The Davana Sealman Wing."

35:24.257 --> 35:26.894
It must be simply,
"The Sealman Wing."

35:26.928 --> 35:28.896
I'm sure you understand.

35:28.930 --> 35:31.465
Giving like this
is generational.

35:37.905 --> 35:39.206
Is he still on the line?

35:39.239 --> 35:41.241
- Yes, ma'am.
- Dr. Myers?

35:41.274 --> 35:43.243
He cleared security
three minutes ago.

35:43.276 --> 35:45.647
Have him wait,
until I'm done with this.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.247
Thank you.

35:54.689 --> 35:56.256
I thought I was clear.

35:56.289 --> 35:58.258
Never on the office number.

36:05.332 --> 36:06.768
He knows.

36:06.801 --> 36:08.335
That's a bit vague.

36:08.368 --> 36:09.937
He knows my name, where I live,

36:09.971 --> 36:12.339
and he won't do the job,
and he's got...

36:12.372 --> 36:14.542
He's got Van Camp's
flash drives.

36:14.575 --> 36:16.944
You said he wasn't
going to be a problem.

36:16.978 --> 36:19.212
I'm going to call Mexico City.

36:19.246 --> 36:21.214
That's one solution.

36:21.248 --> 36:23.518
An obvious and unsubtle one.

36:24.652 --> 36:26.253
What does he want?

36:26.286 --> 36:27.831
To have the contract on the girl
called off.

36:27.855 --> 36:29.489
We do that, he turns
over the info.

36:29.524 --> 36:31.358
There's something
to be said for that.

36:31.391 --> 36:32.994
You can't trust him.

36:33.027 --> 36:35.228
I didn't say I trusted him.

36:35.262 --> 36:36.931
I said, I see his point of view.

36:36.964 --> 36:39.701
Look, I know
what's on that drive.

36:39.734 --> 36:42.302
Randy's pretty obvious
about his quirks.

36:42.335 --> 36:43.638
This is not a conversation

36:43.671 --> 36:45.573
I'm comfortable
having with you, William.

36:45.606 --> 36:47.842
Oh, Jesus Christ, he knows!

36:47.875 --> 36:49.443
About the girl, about me.

36:49.476 --> 36:50.812
I'll handle it.

36:50.845 --> 36:52.479
And don't call me again.

36:57.284 --> 36:58.485
Honestly, how it works,

36:58.519 --> 37:00.855
if you want my opinion,
is this the truth?

37:00.888 --> 37:02.724
Mm-hmm.

37:02.757 --> 37:04.859
Thank you kind, sir.

37:04.892 --> 37:07.394
Okay, as I was saying,
the truth...

37:07.427 --> 37:09.731
Well, well, wait. My bad.

37:09.764 --> 37:11.999
Cheers, again.

37:12.033 --> 37:14.434
So, maybe we
should just go upstairs,

37:14.468 --> 37:16.671
make some sort of a deal,
'cause at the end of the day,

37:16.704 --> 37:17.772
all I want is a blowie.

37:17.805 --> 37:19.741
Keep your voice down.

37:19.774 --> 37:21.642
Shh, we got a deal.

37:21.676 --> 37:22.744
I'll keep my voice down,

37:22.777 --> 37:24.478
but we still got to negotiate.

37:24.512 --> 37:27.280
Hey, leave the lady alone, pal.

37:27.314 --> 37:28.616
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, pops.

37:28.649 --> 37:30.484
First of all,
this ain't no lady.

37:30.518 --> 37:32.553
Which you're about to find out

37:32.587 --> 37:34.287
right about now,
am I right. Babe?

37:34.321 --> 37:36.958
No, you're drunk. Go to bed.

37:36.991 --> 37:39.292
Okay, can you do us a favor,
please

37:39.326 --> 37:40.762
and get the fuck out of here...

37:43.598 --> 37:44.599
Fuck!

37:45.800 --> 37:47.467
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:47.935 --> 37:49.504
Fuck you!

38:02.884 --> 38:04.417
Thank you.

38:05.385 --> 38:08.388
I'm sorry. It's embarrassing.

38:08.421 --> 38:09.857
He's just a drunk at a bar,

38:09.891 --> 38:12.894
being an asshole in front
of a beautiful lady.

38:12.927 --> 38:14.695
Happens all the time.

38:47.595 --> 38:48.729
<i>Gracias.</i>

38:53.000 --> 38:54.669
Tequila!

39:08.149 --> 39:09.984
Oh, come on, at least
I'm trying, Hugo.

39:10.017 --> 39:11.586
U-go.

39:12.687 --> 39:14.589
U-go.

39:14.622 --> 39:16.423
Ugo.

39:16.456 --> 39:18.993
They just don't wanna know,
do they?

39:19.026 --> 39:20.862
Take the little victories.

39:20.895 --> 39:22.763
Beatriz is out of detention.

39:33.908 --> 39:34.908
Why six?

39:36.644 --> 39:37.879
You don't want to know.

39:37.912 --> 39:39.881
Actually, I do.

39:41.649 --> 39:44.886
I was working on a case
in Juarez.

39:44.919 --> 39:46.520
The Dead Girls.

39:47.655 --> 39:50.558
Imagine, so many women disappear

39:50.591 --> 39:52.994
and you can't do nothing.

39:53.027 --> 39:55.462
They say everyone
has their number.

39:55.495 --> 39:58.633
For the police they're all
just numbers.

39:58.666 --> 40:00.601
Six?

40:00.635 --> 40:02.937
Emiliana Manteras
was 13 years old.

40:02.970 --> 40:05.640
Left her job at a
Maquilladora and disappeared.

40:05.673 --> 40:07.141
Just gone.

40:07.174 --> 40:08.576
Four months later,
a couple of kids

40:08.609 --> 40:10.044
found her body in a dump.

40:11.946 --> 40:13.748
Her mother, her sisters.

40:15.049 --> 40:16.817
They were strong.

40:16.851 --> 40:18.719
They plastered Emiliana's
photo on the walls

40:18.753 --> 40:20.821
of headquarters in all the city.

40:21.822 --> 40:23.224
The problem wasn't
that no one knew

40:23.257 --> 40:24.725
what happened to the girl.

40:24.759 --> 40:27.194
Everyone knew.

40:27.228 --> 40:28.996
Emiliana got into a car
with a soldier.

40:29.030 --> 40:30.698
Arturo Pontilla.

40:30.731 --> 40:33.200
Pontilla liked to party
with the Narcos.

40:33.234 --> 40:34.535
I followed him.

40:34.568 --> 40:36.671
I built the case quietly.

40:36.704 --> 40:38.205
But since Pontilla was military,

40:38.239 --> 40:40.508
the indictment had to go
to his commander first

40:40.541 --> 40:42.643
and they just fucking
transfer him to Sinaloa.

40:45.880 --> 40:48.749
Three weeks later,
Emiliana's mother,

40:48.783 --> 40:50.818
aunt and three sisters
disappeared.

40:52.720 --> 40:54.689
They hung those women
from a bridge

40:54.722 --> 40:57.758
right in front
of my office window.

40:57.792 --> 40:58.960
Jesus.

41:01.028 --> 41:02.863
You should learn the prayer.

41:28.222 --> 41:29.623
Hey!

41:31.892 --> 41:33.961
Shh! Hey!

41:35.329 --> 41:36.897
You're okay.

41:37.898 --> 41:39.033
Who are you?

41:39.066 --> 41:41.102
I'm Maya.

41:41.135 --> 41:42.570
You're at the hotel.

41:42.603 --> 41:45.006
- Hotel?
- Yes.

41:45.039 --> 41:46.774
Just had a bad dream.

41:48.275 --> 41:49.610
You're okay.

42:35.756 --> 42:37.925
That was nice,
maybe next time you're in town...

42:37.958 --> 42:40.194
I won't be back.

42:40.227 --> 42:41.862
Alright.

42:41.896 --> 42:44.865
- Good luck then!
- And to you.

42:44.899 --> 42:46.267
A 13-year-old girl

42:46.300 --> 42:48.369
has been murdered
in Sunset Heights.

42:48.402 --> 42:49.870
The minor, Beatriz Leon,

42:49.904 --> 42:52.339
had recently been
relocated to a group home

42:52.373 --> 42:54.642
from an El Paso
detention center.

42:54.675 --> 42:56.744
According to an El Paso
police spokesman,

42:56.777 --> 42:58.079
the young girl's murder is...

42:58.112 --> 43:00.247
Was I here last night?

43:00.281 --> 43:02.883
Yes. What's wrong?

43:02.917 --> 43:04.752
We're getting very
few details...

43:04.785 --> 43:06.754
- You sure?
- Yes!

43:06.787 --> 43:08.089
- I was here?
- Yes!

43:08.122 --> 43:10.224
- All night?
- Yes! Stop it, you're hurting...

43:10.257 --> 43:12.326
- I was here all night?
- Yes.

43:12.359 --> 43:14.829
Listen to me. Very carefully.

43:14.862 --> 43:16.230
You have to leave now.

43:16.263 --> 43:17.965
You were never here,
we never met.

43:17.998 --> 43:20.634
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

43:20.668 --> 43:22.369
I have to go. Right?

43:22.403 --> 43:24.371
You stay away
from this hotel for a while.

43:24.405 --> 43:25.706
- A long while!
- Okay.

43:25.739 --> 43:28.175
- Do you hear me?
- Yes!

43:28.209 --> 43:31.112
Do not answer that door
for anyone. Anyone!

43:39.019 --> 43:40.988
Well executed,
it is worth noting

43:41.021 --> 43:42.823
that violence against children,

43:42.857 --> 43:44.358
is a calling card of the cartels

43:44.391 --> 43:45.826
across the border.

43:45.860 --> 43:48.696
Called on for comment,
the Mayor had none.

44:28.903 --> 44:30.380
Hey! You forgot them,
you forgot your pills...

44:30.404 --> 44:32.173
Get back! Get back!

46:10.505 --> 46:12.840
When did you go soft, Alex?

46:14.609 --> 46:16.810
They'll end you for this.

46:16.844 --> 46:19.046
Happy retirement, Maury!

46:22.449 --> 46:24.218
Alex!

46:27.121 --> 46:28.155
Alex!

46:38.932 --> 46:42.903
Goodness, you got the
heart of a 35-year-old.

46:42.936 --> 46:45.573
At this rate,
you'll live to be 130.

46:45.607 --> 46:49.343
I'll give you
five million to make it 135.

46:54.014 --> 46:56.016
If you said, "Yes,"
I'd fire you.

46:56.050 --> 46:58.919
You know if I said yes,
I'd want you to.

46:58.952 --> 47:02.624
My grandfather is a Abruzzese.
He lived to be 104.

47:02.657 --> 47:05.859
Yeah? Lucky guy.

47:05.893 --> 47:08.162
You know, that all region,
along the Adriatic,

47:08.195 --> 47:12.433
and Okinawa, Japan,
they call those blue zones.

47:12.466 --> 47:13.601
Places that generally have

47:13.635 --> 47:15.603
a higher percentage
of centenarians.

47:15.637 --> 47:18.138
I'm aware, Joseph. But why?

47:18.172 --> 47:21.241
Nutrition? Lack of
pollutants in the air?

47:21.275 --> 47:24.178
There is no reason
we have to age, to decay.

47:24.211 --> 47:27.047
Some medical professionals
might actually argue that.

47:27.081 --> 47:30.150
Everything can be
reprogrammed, modded.

47:30.184 --> 47:32.252
Why shouldn't human health
be the same?

47:32.286 --> 47:34.054
DNA's an algorithm.

47:34.088 --> 47:36.168
Look, I'm not gonna tell you
how to spend your money.

47:37.057 --> 47:38.959
Especially when so much of it

47:38.992 --> 47:41.061
ends up in your pocket.

47:57.177 --> 47:58.979
I appreciate you
giving me a call.

47:59.012 --> 48:00.558
I don't know what the fuck
is going on in this town.

48:00.582 --> 48:03.450
Swear to God, it's getting
more like Afghanistan every day.

48:06.120 --> 48:07.488
- Who are they?
- Matched set.

48:07.522 --> 48:08.989
Jane and Joe Doe.

48:09.022 --> 48:10.668
He was in the driver's seat,
blown the fuck up.

48:10.692 --> 48:12.126
She was in the trunk.

48:12.159 --> 48:13.927
.32 caliber bullet to the neck,

48:13.961 --> 48:15.396
jacketed with
suppressor markings.

48:15.429 --> 48:18.600
Just like we pulled out
of Beatriz Leon.

48:18.633 --> 48:21.135
Car's registered to a
David Marshall.

48:21.168 --> 48:22.670
Rented at the airport.

48:22.704 --> 48:25.272
Some expat businessman
out of San Diego.

48:25.305 --> 48:27.107
Probably the corpse in the car.

48:27.141 --> 48:29.076
We're running teeth
on them both.

48:29.109 --> 48:30.453
Okay, this guy is drunk
as a skunk.

48:30.477 --> 48:33.147
He, uh, pulled a .24
three times over the limit.

48:33.180 --> 48:35.024
So I need you to sign off
on the report before you go.

48:35.048 --> 48:36.518
You got it.

48:38.152 --> 48:40.688
- What's that?
- Found them on the floor.

48:40.722 --> 48:42.956
It didn't match anything
on our database,

48:42.990 --> 48:45.693
so the lab is running chem-test.

48:45.727 --> 48:47.203
If that's a prescription,
it might help...

48:47.227 --> 48:49.096
The lab's on it,
we might not be fancy,

48:49.129 --> 48:50.632
Vincent, but we ain't dumb.

48:52.199 --> 48:53.711
I'll run the Marshall name
through VICAP,

48:53.735 --> 48:55.102
see if anything comes up.

48:55.135 --> 48:56.413
I'll hit you up
with the ballistics

48:56.437 --> 48:58.939
as soon as they come back.
Same with the pill.

49:00.575 --> 49:03.143
Hey!

49:03.177 --> 49:06.947
Sorry about the girl, man.
It was fucked up.

49:19.694 --> 49:21.729
I couldn't go back.

49:21.763 --> 49:24.398
They don't love you
in Mexico anymore?

49:26.400 --> 49:28.603
You're not asking for
my permission to stay, are you?

49:28.636 --> 49:32.105
- Linda said I had to.
- Oh, well, in that case...

49:32.139 --> 49:35.209
Come on, you know
what she's like.

49:35.242 --> 49:36.443
Yeah.

49:36.477 --> 49:39.581
Nobody gives a fuck about
that girl, Vincent.

49:39.614 --> 49:42.216
Except you, me and Linda.

49:44.251 --> 49:47.522
I can do things
you and her can't. You know?

49:47.555 --> 49:49.691
As a concerned citizen.

49:49.724 --> 49:51.759
From Mexico?

49:51.793 --> 49:54.194
Okay, concerned Mexican citizen.

49:54.228 --> 49:55.730
With questionable investigative

49:55.763 --> 49:57.264
authority in the United States.

49:58.733 --> 50:00.768
Yeah, Nussbaum is
really gonna go for that.

50:00.802 --> 50:04.071
Fuck Nussbaum.
I don't work for him.

52:18.506 --> 52:20.340
Look, I promise
you I had no reason

52:20.374 --> 52:22.710
to say anything unless
you give me one.

52:22.744 --> 52:26.380
What you're doing right
now is incredibly stupid, Ellis.

52:26.413 --> 52:27.782
I hope you understand that.

52:27.815 --> 52:31.886
You've left me no choice.
I won't be cut out.

52:31.919 --> 52:33.487
Look, this doesn't
have to be ugly.

52:33.521 --> 52:35.322
Blackmail is already ugly.

52:35.355 --> 52:37.792
- Look, all...
- Mr. Van Camp!

52:37.825 --> 52:39.459
We are not negotiating.

52:39.493 --> 52:42.697
You've crossed a line
from which there is no return.

54:09.550 --> 54:12.019
Looks like another .32 caliber.

54:12.053 --> 54:14.055
And I'm guessing
it's also gonna be jacketed

54:14.088 --> 54:15.890
with suppressor markings.

54:15.923 --> 54:17.658
I'm gonna go talk to the wife.

54:18.926 --> 54:20.360
See you there.

54:20.393 --> 54:21.963
Do you think he's right?

54:21.996 --> 54:23.631
I'd put money on it.

54:23.664 --> 54:25.533
This is a problem, no question.

54:25.566 --> 54:28.503
Maybe a hitter
cleaning up some shit.

54:32.540 --> 54:35.510
I'll catch you guys later.

54:35.543 --> 54:36.878
Good idea.

54:42.650 --> 54:44.018
Last time I checked, Serra,

54:44.051 --> 54:45.720
you were working the
Van Camp murder.

54:45.753 --> 54:47.722
Last time I checked, sir,
I work for the FBI.

54:47.755 --> 54:49.456
Was that Hugo Marquez
I just saw?

54:49.489 --> 54:52.359
Listen... I think
there's a connection

54:52.392 --> 54:54.461
between Beatriz Leon,
the Jane Doe found

54:54.494 --> 54:56.840
in the trunk of the car downtown
and this guy, William Borden.

54:56.864 --> 54:59.399
If this does turn out
to be a jacket of .32,

54:59.432 --> 55:01.410
that's three people likely
killed with the same weapon.

55:01.434 --> 55:03.805
Look, I get it, the girl.
She's under your skin.

55:03.838 --> 55:04.948
Maybe you're a little obsessed...

55:04.972 --> 55:06.073
I'm just doing my job.

55:06.107 --> 55:08.709
Hugo thinks it's a pro,
settling scores.

55:08.743 --> 55:11.946
We think it could be a
hitter from across the fence.

55:11.979 --> 55:13.548
But you can't be sure.

55:13.581 --> 55:15.716
We can't, but if the
ballistics match, and there

55:15.750 --> 55:17.694
really is a Mexican killer
tearing ass through town,

55:17.718 --> 55:19.386
we might want to get
ahead of that.

55:19.419 --> 55:21.522
And we're gonna need Marquez.

55:23.390 --> 55:26.093
Alright, do what you have to do.

55:26.127 --> 55:27.962
But I want updates twice a day.

55:27.995 --> 55:29.530
Yeah.

55:32.465 --> 55:34.669
Lab just came back
on those pills.

55:34.702 --> 55:35.770
Diffadyl.

55:35.803 --> 55:39.574
Alzheimer's drug. Your
shooter is loosing his shit.

55:39.607 --> 55:42.543
- Okay. Is the wife inside?
- Yeah.

55:42.577 --> 55:43.987
Keep your hands away
from the cage on that one.

55:44.011 --> 55:47.081
I don't know if it's medicine
or just plain crazy.

55:47.114 --> 55:49.550
- Wanna sit in on this?
- Sure.

55:57.024 --> 56:01.896
Mrs. Borden, I'm Agent Serra.
This is Detective Marquez.

56:01.929 --> 56:03.865
I'm sorry for what's happened.

56:03.898 --> 56:06.067
Part of life, right?

56:06.100 --> 56:07.902
It's what they say...

56:09.036 --> 56:11.839
Hasn't really sunk in.

56:11.873 --> 56:15.643
Hmm, FBI. Fancy.

56:15.676 --> 56:18.478
- You an agent, too?
- Liaison from Mexico.

56:18.512 --> 56:20.480
What's Mexico have to do
with William?

56:20.514 --> 56:21.849
He hated the place.

56:21.883 --> 56:25.152
Well, that's what
we're... hoping to find out.

56:25.186 --> 56:27.121
Have you noticed
anything unusual

56:27.154 --> 56:28.856
happen in the past few weeks,

56:28.890 --> 56:32.459
where your husband's behavior
has changed at all?

56:32.492 --> 56:36.097
Will's behavior
hasn't changed in 20 years.

56:36.130 --> 56:38.766
No. Nothing.

56:38.799 --> 56:41.168
- What kind of law did he do?
- Real Estate.

56:41.202 --> 56:43.571
Sorry to ask this, Mrs. Borden.

56:43.604 --> 56:45.039
But do you know
if your husband had

56:45.072 --> 56:46.641
any ties to prostitution?

56:46.674 --> 56:49.810
I have no idea. Sit down.

56:51.879 --> 56:54.048
Bill paying for it?

56:54.081 --> 56:56.517
Doesn't seem like him.

56:56.550 --> 56:58.786
Did your husband know
Ellis Van Camp?

56:58.819 --> 57:02.823
I know Wendy.
I see her at the same events.

57:02.857 --> 57:06.928
It's all one big
cocktail party up here.

57:06.961 --> 57:09.864
You like cocktails, Detective?

57:09.897 --> 57:13.701
Margaritas? Pina Coladas?

57:15.236 --> 57:17.505
Thanks for your help,
Mrs. Borden.

57:17.538 --> 57:19.907
If you need anything,
just give us a call.

57:27.715 --> 57:28.992
I'm afraid
she can't be disturbed...

57:29.016 --> 57:30.785
Don't even fucking start.

57:31.852 --> 57:33.521
I've been calling you
all morning.

57:33.554 --> 57:36.223
Borden's dead.
Someone executed him.

57:36.257 --> 57:39.492
And if he got to Borden,
then he's close.

57:39.527 --> 57:40.962
Jesus, mum...

57:48.302 --> 57:50.571
Just take a breath.

57:52.273 --> 57:53.674
<i>Bravo.</i>

57:55.009 --> 57:58.579
You need to leave El Paso.
Immediately.

57:58.612 --> 57:59.981
Take the company plane.

58:00.014 --> 58:01.792
What about tomorrow night,
it's all been arranged...

58:01.816 --> 58:03.818
Listen to me.

58:03.851 --> 58:07.688
Tomorrow, after the party,
you'll fly to Geneva.

58:07.722 --> 58:10.224
Stay at the house
and make arrangements

58:10.257 --> 58:11.926
for you to check
into rehab there.

58:11.959 --> 58:13.127
Rehab?

58:13.160 --> 58:14.795
If things connect to you,

58:14.829 --> 58:17.264
and we have a problem,
you will be working

58:17.298 --> 58:19.867
on your issues,
which will buy us time

58:19.900 --> 58:23.604
to quietly hire
very good lawyers.

58:23.637 --> 58:27.108
Besides... you need help, Randy.

58:30.011 --> 58:31.112
I'm sorry.

58:32.146 --> 58:34.015
I'm so sorry.

58:34.048 --> 58:36.584
I know you are, baby.

58:36.617 --> 58:38.753
I know you are.

58:41.822 --> 58:43.924
Full ballistics came back.

58:43.958 --> 58:46.794
Same gun killed Beatriz
and the Jane Doe in the car,

58:46.827 --> 58:50.765
but not Borden.
Two .32s, two shooters.

58:50.798 --> 58:52.233
Trafficking, Vincent Serra.

58:52.266 --> 58:55.169
You're the one who took
the girl to the group home.

58:55.202 --> 58:57.638
- Weren't you?
- Who is this?

58:57.671 --> 59:00.107
Marshall. David Marshall.

59:00.141 --> 59:01.976
Tap and trace.

59:02.009 --> 59:05.046
Ah, David Marshall
burned up a car downtown.

59:05.079 --> 59:06.247
Is that your doing?

59:06.280 --> 59:09.016
I can't keep doing
your job for you.

59:09.050 --> 59:10.117
What job is that?

59:10.151 --> 59:13.320
Borden, Van Camp.
What they did to children.

59:13.354 --> 59:15.056
You're not doing
anything about it.

59:15.089 --> 59:17.191
Are you saying
you killed William Borden?

59:17.224 --> 59:20.861
- And Ellis Van Camp?
- Yes.

59:20.895 --> 59:24.198
And what about the girl?
Beatriz Leon.

59:24.231 --> 59:26.600
Not the girl. That was Mauricio.

59:26.634 --> 59:28.803
The man in the car.

59:28.836 --> 59:32.673
You're too slow to make
them pay. They're too rich.

59:32.706 --> 59:37.011
- Who's too rich?
- The lawyer, the client.

59:37.044 --> 59:38.612
Who's the client?

59:40.981 --> 59:43.617
- Did you know her?
- Who?

59:43.651 --> 59:47.955
The... the... the girl.
B... Beatriz.

59:47.988 --> 59:51.092
- A little.
- Did you care?

59:51.125 --> 59:52.960
Fifteen seconds.

59:52.993 --> 59:54.628
I certainly did.

59:54.662 --> 59:57.665
I want to believe that you
are a good man, Vincent.

59:57.698 --> 01:00:00.768
I'm the bad man.
Have been for a long time.

01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:02.369
But they have to be punished.

01:00:02.403 --> 01:00:04.638
If I can't finish this...

01:00:04.672 --> 01:00:06.640
you have to.

01:00:10.144 --> 01:00:12.046
He's downstairs in the park.

01:00:22.156 --> 01:00:23.991
Hey, move!

01:00:24.024 --> 01:00:25.392
What is this?

01:00:30.064 --> 01:00:32.700
He's fucking with us.

01:00:32.733 --> 01:00:34.768
He's just telling us
we're way too slow.

01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:37.280
We've got an asshole
exploiting a kid

01:00:37.304 --> 01:00:39.907
and how long is it taking us
to bring him to trial?

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.909
Two to three years, right?

01:00:50.317 --> 01:00:52.853
He said they're too rich.

01:00:52.887 --> 01:00:54.731
Now, we've been getting
push back on the trafficking

01:00:54.755 --> 01:00:56.423
every step of the way.

01:00:56.457 --> 01:00:58.692
No, I think
he's, he's taking out

01:00:58.726 --> 01:01:01.729
the traffickers
that we couldn't.

01:01:01.762 --> 01:01:03.330
Leaving us breadcrumbs.

01:01:03.364 --> 01:01:05.766
Proving a point.

01:01:21.482 --> 01:01:25.186
Well... Detective Marquez.

01:01:25.219 --> 01:01:26.921
How long were you watching me?

01:01:26.954 --> 01:01:28.889
I just got here, Mrs. Borden.

01:01:28.923 --> 01:01:30.925
You shouldn't leave
the gate open.

01:01:30.958 --> 01:01:33.427
Whatever will be will be.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.863
And if you're
watching over me...

01:01:35.896 --> 01:01:38.199
nothing to worry about, right?

01:01:38.232 --> 01:01:40.201
You're a strong swimmer.

01:01:40.234 --> 01:01:42.169
I'm out of shape.

01:01:54.048 --> 01:01:57.351
I was an alternate
for the '92 Olympic team.

01:01:57.384 --> 01:02:00.921
I was 17. Best time of my life.

01:02:00.955 --> 01:02:03.424
By '96, I'd lost a second.

01:02:03.457 --> 01:02:05.926
That was it.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.428
Done.

01:02:07.461 --> 01:02:08.929
So instead of a Wheaties Box

01:02:08.963 --> 01:02:11.198
and a dashing husband in LA,

01:02:11.232 --> 01:02:13.200
I ended up here.

01:02:13.234 --> 01:02:15.503
In Texas.

01:02:15.537 --> 01:02:17.104
Could you pass me that glass?

01:02:18.472 --> 01:02:19.974
Sure.

01:02:25.513 --> 01:02:27.214
So, what do you want, Detective?

01:02:29.416 --> 01:02:31.519
Well...

01:02:31.553 --> 01:02:34.021
I'm not here to clean your pool.

01:02:34.054 --> 01:02:36.890
You are not a real
cop here, are you?

01:02:38.392 --> 01:02:39.527
That's why I'm here.

01:02:39.561 --> 01:02:42.196
What? To not arrest me?

01:02:42.229 --> 01:02:43.998
Have you ever heard your
husband talk about

01:02:44.031 --> 01:02:45.533
a man named David Marshall?

01:02:45.567 --> 01:02:49.870
You didn't come here
to ask me questions.

01:02:49.903 --> 01:02:52.172
I didn't come here
for that either.

01:02:53.974 --> 01:02:56.410
I stayed out of
William's business.

01:02:56.443 --> 01:02:58.145
Wives know.

01:02:59.446 --> 01:03:01.282
I never knew the name,

01:03:01.315 --> 01:03:02.850
but I heard him on the phone.

01:03:02.883 --> 01:03:06.020
He was nervous.
He didn't want me to hear.

01:03:06.053 --> 01:03:09.557
He was talking about a man
from Mexico City.

01:03:09.591 --> 01:03:11.191
Why didn't you say
something before?

01:03:11.225 --> 01:03:14.161
Because of who
he was talking to.

01:03:14.194 --> 01:03:15.896
Davana Sealman.

01:03:15.929 --> 01:03:18.432
That's why I didn't
say anything.

01:03:18.465 --> 01:03:20.067
He was being used.

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.368
How?

01:03:21.402 --> 01:03:23.203
You should go.

01:03:25.607 --> 01:03:27.207
Thank you, <i>Senora</i> Borden.

01:03:27.241 --> 01:03:30.044
Don't ever come back,
Detective Marquez.

01:03:34.448 --> 01:03:35.883
Davana Sealman? You sure?

01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:37.585
That's the name she said.

01:03:37.619 --> 01:03:39.920
Borden was probably one
of her attorneys.

01:03:39.953 --> 01:03:41.889
Nope, Borden's name isn't listed

01:03:41.922 --> 01:03:43.324
on any of the filings
for Sea Corp

01:03:43.357 --> 01:03:45.159
or Davana Sealman personally.

01:03:45.192 --> 01:03:47.595
You realize we're talking
about one of the most powerful

01:03:47.629 --> 01:03:49.330
real estate moguls
in the country, right?

01:03:49.363 --> 01:03:50.598
Yeah. Yeah.

01:03:50.632 --> 01:03:52.475
I know, but Borden spoke
to Sealman on the phone

01:03:52.499 --> 01:03:54.068
about the
"Man from Mexico City."

01:03:54.101 --> 01:03:57.871
Oh, you got proof?
Well, did you bang her at least?

01:03:57.905 --> 01:03:59.449
I mean, if you're gonna take
the word of a half-drunk

01:03:59.473 --> 01:04:02.610
trophy wife, you may as well get
something out of it, right?

01:04:02.644 --> 01:04:05.079
- Did she elaborate?
- What?

01:04:05.112 --> 01:04:06.480
On the "Man from Mexico City."

01:04:06.514 --> 01:04:08.082
Shut up, hold on!

01:04:08.115 --> 01:04:10.851
Borden wasn't one of
Davana Sealman's lawyers.

01:04:11.985 --> 01:04:13.954
He was one of Randy
Sealman's lawyers.

01:04:13.987 --> 01:04:16.090
Davana's son.

01:04:16.123 --> 01:04:19.393
Apparently, Randy's also
a real estate mogul.

01:04:19.426 --> 01:04:21.295
Oh, fuck.

01:04:21.328 --> 01:04:25.600
Randy Sealman's company owns the
Central Processing facility.

01:04:25.633 --> 01:04:27.067
Where they sent Beatriz.

01:04:27.101 --> 01:04:29.069
Hey, in case
you haven't noticed,

01:04:29.103 --> 01:04:30.505
they send a lot of people there.

01:04:30.538 --> 01:04:32.640
Oh, yeah, I know.

01:04:32.674 --> 01:04:34.942
But she's 13.

01:04:34.975 --> 01:04:37.244
Imagine how vulnerable
you feel at that age

01:04:37.277 --> 01:04:38.946
in an ICE center.

01:04:40.147 --> 01:04:42.149
Okay, let's take a look.

01:04:44.118 --> 01:04:45.953
Okay. Well, it's not her
first time there.

01:04:45.986 --> 01:04:47.297
She was there last year
for three weeks

01:04:47.321 --> 01:04:49.089
with her father,
and then they were deported.

01:04:49.123 --> 01:04:53.427
It gets stickier. Ellis
Van Camp was CPF's builder.

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:56.130
So everyone associated
with this Processing Centre,

01:04:56.163 --> 01:04:57.665
the lawyer, the builder,

01:04:57.699 --> 01:05:00.367
Beatriz, all dead.

01:05:01.703 --> 01:05:04.004
He's going to kill
Randy Sealman.

This is so far away
from official.

01:06:18.513 --> 01:06:20.113
So this guy,

01:06:20.147 --> 01:06:22.049
he owns the detention center.

01:06:22.082 --> 01:06:24.051
And you're wondering why
we're protecting him?

01:06:24.084 --> 01:06:26.220

Randy is on the lower deck,
moving inside.

01:06:41.268 --> 01:06:44.506
- On my way.
- Hugo, keep eyes on deck.

01:06:44.539 --> 01:06:47.407
Got it.

01:06:50.177 --> 01:06:51.579
Target's on the boat!

01:07:06.561 --> 01:07:08.362
Take that shit off.

01:07:15.803 --> 01:07:18.573
When I leave, lock the door.

01:07:18.606 --> 01:07:21.408
Okay? Good girl.

01:07:30.484 --> 01:07:32.119
You scum.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.508
Put it down.

01:08:32.714 --> 01:08:34.348
Attaboy.

01:08:37.350 --> 01:08:39.754
You're Vincent, aren't you?

01:08:39.787 --> 01:08:41.220
I am.

01:08:41.254 --> 01:08:43.457
I'm Alex. Alex Lewis.

01:08:44.826 --> 01:08:47.694
You know what those people did
to that child, right?

01:08:47.729 --> 01:08:49.631
Only too well.

01:08:49.663 --> 01:08:51.933
I've done crazy things.

01:08:51.966 --> 01:08:54.201
But you don't hurt
children, ever.

01:08:54.234 --> 01:08:56.203
Listen, why don't you
and I just...

01:08:56.236 --> 01:08:58.337
- Just have a talk?
- No time for that.

01:08:58.372 --> 01:08:59.774
I understand
why you're saying that.

01:08:59.807 --> 01:09:01.643
I know you're not well.

01:09:01.676 --> 01:09:03.243
We all have to die, Vincent.

01:09:03.276 --> 01:09:04.854
What's important is what you
do before you go...

01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:07.256
- Vincent! Put your gun down!
- Get outta here get outta here!

01:09:07.279 --> 01:09:08.916
- Is your friend a good shot?
- Very.

01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:10.652
- Then it's in your hands.
- Don't move!

01:09:10.685 --> 01:09:12.920
Put the fucking gun down!

01:09:12.953 --> 01:09:16.524
If I'm dead,
she'll never know the truth.

01:09:16.557 --> 01:09:18.526
Put the gun down.

01:09:37.111 --> 01:09:40.548
- Hey, hey, hey!
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:09:40.581 --> 01:09:41.916
I've got it!

01:11:01.596 --> 01:11:03.798
You know, I quit drinking
15 years ago.

01:11:03.831 --> 01:11:05.800
But right now, I can
actually taste the scotch

01:11:05.833 --> 01:11:07.902
in the back of my throat.

01:11:07.935 --> 01:11:09.402
Davana Sealman's only son

01:11:09.436 --> 01:11:11.873
was just murdered on my watch.

01:11:11.906 --> 01:11:14.374
She's not happy with us.

01:11:14.407 --> 01:11:16.711
The lady has even hired
off-duty cops for protection.

01:11:16.744 --> 01:11:18.378
He was way ahead of us.

01:11:18.411 --> 01:11:20.057
He was probably on that boat
before the party even began.

01:11:20.081 --> 01:11:21.983
Who is this fucking guy, Vince?

01:11:22.016 --> 01:11:23.985
Alex Lewis.

01:11:24.018 --> 01:11:26.353
Well, I can tell you
he's American.

01:11:26.386 --> 01:11:28.388
He's no doubt a contractor,
but...

01:11:28.421 --> 01:11:31.025
I don't think
these have all been hits.

01:11:31.058 --> 01:11:33.360
He wants revenge
for Beatriz Leon.

01:12:15.970 --> 01:12:17.572
Sir, you alright?

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:25.478
Have you been
drinking tonight, sir?

01:12:25.513 --> 01:12:28.082
Paul...

01:12:28.115 --> 01:12:30.885
Paul with his sons.

01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:44.364
Jesus.

01:15:01.602 --> 01:15:04.739
Motorcycle patrolman Eric Lyle.

01:15:04.772 --> 01:15:06.741
Must have found Alex wounded.

01:15:06.774 --> 01:15:08.776
There was blood
all over the Bronco.

01:15:08.809 --> 01:15:11.579
I don't know.
Maybe he got spooked.

01:15:11.612 --> 01:15:13.014
That's not his style.

01:15:13.047 --> 01:15:14.281
His style is murder, Vincent.

01:15:14.315 --> 01:15:16.584
No, we need to find him
before the El Paso PD.

01:15:16.617 --> 01:15:17.828
They're not going
to be happy about this.

01:15:17.852 --> 01:15:21.155
Well, we know something
they don't.

01:15:21.188 --> 01:15:24.158
I think I know
who Alex Lewis is.

01:15:24.191 --> 01:15:25.659
I ran juvenile records.

01:15:25.693 --> 01:15:28.062
Vandalism, auto-theft, assault.

01:15:28.095 --> 01:15:29.697
Well, it could be him.

01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:32.900
Only problem is,
Alex Lewis is dead.

01:15:32.933 --> 01:15:35.136
He and his father died in the
fire at the family bakery

01:15:35.169 --> 01:15:36.637
forty years ago.

01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:39.673
Investigators thought
Alex set the fire.

01:15:39.707 --> 01:15:41.175
Brother's still in town though.

01:15:41.208 --> 01:15:43.577
Care facility on the parkway.

01:15:43.611 --> 01:15:45.646
Advanced Alzheimer's.

01:15:45.679 --> 01:15:47.715
Man's a vegetable.

01:15:47.748 --> 01:15:49.784
I also came up
with medical records.

01:15:49.817 --> 01:15:51.986
Alex and his brother
were well known at the ER.

01:15:52.019 --> 01:15:55.623
Always a "fall down the stairs"
or an "accidental burn."

01:15:55.656 --> 01:15:58.059
Other things
were harder to hide.

01:15:58.092 --> 01:16:00.161
Father was never charged
with the abuse.

01:16:00.194 --> 01:16:02.296
Sexual or physical.

01:16:02.329 --> 01:16:04.065
Want me to warrant the bakery?

01:16:04.098 --> 01:16:05.166
Definitely.

01:17:35.823 --> 01:17:37.324
This guy from Mexico City,

01:17:37.358 --> 01:17:40.161
the one Borden was talking to
Davana Sealman about.

01:17:40.194 --> 01:17:42.963
What if she hired him?

01:17:42.997 --> 01:17:44.437
'Cause I'm thinking
if Alex is not up

01:17:44.465 --> 01:17:46.867
to killing Sealman himself,

01:17:46.901 --> 01:17:48.435
he wants us to bring her in.

01:17:48.469 --> 01:17:50.271
Catch is, the only person
who can connect.

01:17:50.304 --> 01:17:51.372
Sealman to any of this...

01:17:51.405 --> 01:17:52.907
Is Alex.

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.442
She's harder to get
to than any of the others.

01:17:55.476 --> 01:17:58.445
He reached out to you
to cover his bets.

01:17:58.479 --> 01:18:00.181
The only address
from Paul and Alex's

01:18:00.214 --> 01:18:01.448
medical records is the bakery.

01:18:01.482 --> 01:18:03.851
Oh, forget about it,
that place is a wreck.

01:18:03.884 --> 01:18:05.886
Unless you're looking
for a pigeon.

01:18:07.087 --> 01:18:08.489
What did you say?

01:18:08.523 --> 01:18:10.724
Pigeons.

01:18:10.758 --> 01:18:13.060
<i>Palomas.</i>
The place is full of them.

01:18:13.093 --> 01:18:14.929
The lab report on the Bronco...

01:18:14.962 --> 01:18:17.064
the one where the
patrolman got killed,

01:18:17.097 --> 01:18:19.233
the floor had traces
of pigeon shit on it.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.042
Anything I can get you?

01:19:38.312 --> 01:19:39.547
What?

01:19:39.581 --> 01:19:41.583
Anything you need?

01:19:41.616 --> 01:19:43.350
No, thank you.

01:20:01.201 --> 01:20:04.371
Top of the hour, boys. Check in.

01:20:50.484 --> 01:20:51.985
Boss!

01:20:56.457 --> 01:20:58.459
Let him up.

01:20:58.492 --> 01:21:00.427
Get him a new battery.

01:21:12.707 --> 01:21:14.942
- Put them down!
- Now!

01:21:22.684 --> 01:21:24.351
You! Get back!

01:21:37.431 --> 01:21:41.135
Stay in here. Don't open
that door to anybody.

01:21:42.970 --> 01:21:45.540
Boys! Main office.
Live shooter! Live shooter!

01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:34.722
He's headed for the roof.

01:22:54.642 --> 01:22:56.076
Mora.

01:22:56.109 --> 01:22:57.411
Mora, he's on the roof.

01:22:57.444 --> 01:23:00.080
Copy. If you get the chance,
put him down.

01:23:01.381 --> 01:23:02.983
Copy that.

01:23:06.521 --> 01:23:08.623
It's all over.

01:23:08.656 --> 01:23:11.225
Let's get you out of here.

01:23:39.119 --> 01:23:42.289
You killed my son.

01:23:42.322 --> 01:23:43.390
Yes.

01:23:45.693 --> 01:23:47.629
And I know what you've done.

01:24:18.358 --> 01:24:20.060
Firing pin.

01:24:26.333 --> 01:24:29.571
You know why I didn't just
off you back there?

01:24:33.808 --> 01:24:36.476
Let me tell you why.

01:24:42.917 --> 01:24:44.519
That would have been mercy.

01:24:44.552 --> 01:24:46.688
No. I want to see you
go to Yuma.

01:24:46.721 --> 01:24:49.657
Where I will make sure they
fuck you to death, old man.

01:24:49.691 --> 01:24:52.192
You cop-killing piece of shit.

01:24:57.364 --> 01:24:59.366
How about that little girl?

01:24:59.399 --> 01:25:02.269
You know what they do to
people who hurt kids?

01:25:02.302 --> 01:25:07.441
I'll talk to FBI Agent
V... V... Vincent Serra.

01:25:08.643 --> 01:25:09.844
No one else.

01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.782
Fuck the feds.

01:25:14.816 --> 01:25:16.450
We got you on
three counts of murder.

01:25:16.483 --> 01:25:18.753
Your busted fucking gun
matches Borden

01:25:18.786 --> 01:25:20.253
and Officer Eric Lyle.

01:25:20.287 --> 01:25:21.756
Guy had a wife and two kids...

01:25:21.789 --> 01:25:25.392
Danny! He needs a doctor.

01:25:29.564 --> 01:25:31.231
No, he doesn't.

01:25:31.264 --> 01:25:33.501
I've got all day, and
by the end, I swear to God,

01:25:33.534 --> 01:25:36.336
I'll have me a
written confession.

01:25:38.673 --> 01:25:40.842
If he went after Sealman
with a broken gun,

01:25:40.875 --> 01:25:42.577
we'd have heard something.

01:25:42.610 --> 01:25:44.454
I just think he's at the end.
He ain't remembering things.

01:25:44.478 --> 01:25:46.848
And also, PPD has gone
totally silent.

01:25:46.881 --> 01:25:49.517
And this came from the
bakery address.

01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:50.952
What is it?

01:26:11.304 --> 01:26:14.408
Jesus. Where did you get this?

01:26:14.441 --> 01:26:15.910
It doesn't matter.

01:26:15.943 --> 01:26:17.745
El Paso PD are holding
Alex Lewis

01:26:17.779 --> 01:26:19.914
and I need you to transfer him
into our custody.

01:26:19.947 --> 01:26:21.783
Let him be their problem.

01:26:24.519 --> 01:26:26.587
Which side of this do you
really want to be on?

01:26:28.255 --> 01:26:30.490
I need to talk to him.

01:26:30.525 --> 01:26:32.292
But it seems
very powerful people

01:26:32.325 --> 01:26:34.662
don't want that to happen.

01:27:06.393 --> 01:27:08.462
What the fuck did you do to him?

01:27:08.495 --> 01:27:10.998
- He resisted arrest.
- So you had to bust him up?

01:27:11.032 --> 01:27:12.567
He's a cop killer
for fuck's sake.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.769
You like being on
Davana Sealman's payroll?

01:27:14.802 --> 01:27:16.571
Hey!

01:27:16.604 --> 01:27:18.305
Cool off!

01:27:29.851 --> 01:27:31.519
Well, well.

01:27:33.654 --> 01:27:35.455
The FBI.

01:27:36.657 --> 01:27:37.658
Huh.

01:27:38.826 --> 01:27:40.628
You are the one that shot me.

01:27:40.661 --> 01:27:43.363
I'm not going to offer
an apology.

01:27:43.396 --> 01:27:45.533
I'm not asking for one.

01:27:51.539 --> 01:27:52.840
Thank you.

01:28:04.384 --> 01:28:06.754
These aren't going to help
for much longer.

01:28:09.690 --> 01:28:11.993
I understand you want
to clear this up.

01:28:12.026 --> 01:28:13.561
Clear this up?

01:28:13.594 --> 01:28:14.896
No.

01:28:14.929 --> 01:28:16.631
I want Sealman dead.

01:28:16.664 --> 01:28:18.833
Well, she's not officially
tied to any crime.

01:28:18.866 --> 01:28:20.802
You know that's not true.

01:28:20.835 --> 01:28:22.670
She sanctioned the hit.

01:28:22.703 --> 01:28:25.673
She hired me to kill...
two people.

01:28:25.706 --> 01:28:29.577
Ellis Van Camp and
the second was that child.

01:28:29.610 --> 01:28:32.680
Girl of thirteen.
Be... Be... Beatriz.

01:28:34.081 --> 01:28:35.917
I won't do that.

01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:37.450
No.

01:28:38.418 --> 01:28:40.555
No. You don't touch children.

01:28:42.455 --> 01:28:45.392
- Okay, press down.
- Thank you.

01:28:45.425 --> 01:28:47.962
I really appreciate you
being here for me.

01:28:47.995 --> 01:28:49.931
During all this.

01:28:49.964 --> 01:28:52.133
You're not just a client,
you know.

01:28:52.166 --> 01:28:54.535
Is that true, Joseph?

01:28:54.569 --> 01:28:57.138
You know, the hardest thing
is never really trusting

01:28:57.171 --> 01:28:59.140
those people close to you.

01:28:59.173 --> 01:29:00.708
Besides Randy...

01:29:00.741 --> 01:29:03.978
I will never really
know why someone is with me.

01:29:04.011 --> 01:29:07.048
Come on.
I'm your friend, Davana.

01:29:07.081 --> 01:29:08.883
I'm here for you.

01:29:15.156 --> 01:29:18.826
The retainer for your services
is $10 million.

01:29:21.195 --> 01:29:23.564
I can't.

01:29:23.598 --> 01:29:26.399
Do you realize what
you're asking me to do?

01:29:26.433 --> 01:29:28.135
I'm sorry. No.

01:29:28.169 --> 01:29:30.738
- I took an oath.
- An oath?

01:29:30.771 --> 01:29:32.506
Like a marriage vow?

01:29:33.908 --> 01:29:36.476
You were at Randy's parties.

01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:38.411
You think I didn't know?

01:29:38.445 --> 01:29:40.615
So, let's make this simple.

01:29:40.648 --> 01:29:43.416
$10 million or prosecution

01:29:43.450 --> 01:29:45.186
and prison for sex with minors.

01:29:45.219 --> 01:29:46.554
Davana...

01:29:46.587 --> 01:29:48.155
You need to understand
something.

01:29:48.189 --> 01:29:49.824
Randy was weak.

01:29:49.857 --> 01:29:51.893
But he was my son.

01:29:51.926 --> 01:29:53.928
You are not.

01:29:55.796 --> 01:30:00.768
Murder for hire.
Murder for revenge. Child abuse.

01:30:00.801 --> 01:30:02.803
It's all here.

01:30:02.837 --> 01:30:04.205
It's not over.

01:30:04.238 --> 01:30:05.907
Everybody's dead, Alex.

01:30:07.541 --> 01:30:11.679
Even if you do make it to trial,
you get life, my friend,

01:30:11.712 --> 01:30:13.648
which from what
the doctors tell me

01:30:13.681 --> 01:30:15.549
is maybe three to six months.

01:30:16.584 --> 01:30:17.919
So, what are we doing here?

01:30:17.952 --> 01:30:21.822
- Why are we here?
- Davana Sealman.

01:30:21.856 --> 01:30:23.190
Justice.

01:30:23.224 --> 01:30:25.526
Justice?

01:30:25.559 --> 01:30:29.030
- Are you kidding me?
- I'll testify to all that...

01:30:29.063 --> 01:30:30.731
You're a contract killer.

01:30:30.765 --> 01:30:33.067
You think your testimony's
going to stand up in court?

01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:36.737
- She hired me to kill a child.
- Did you get that in writing?

01:30:36.771 --> 01:30:38.239
We're gonna need that evidence.

01:30:42.243 --> 01:30:44.946
You really expect
we're gonna find justice?

01:30:44.979 --> 01:30:46.847
I expect you to try.

01:30:48.716 --> 01:30:50.551
Listen...

01:30:50.584 --> 01:30:52.086
Let me tell you something...

01:30:52.119 --> 01:30:53.921
about justice.

01:30:53.955 --> 01:30:55.623
Twelve months ago,

01:30:55.656 --> 01:30:58.491
a drunk driver
was flying down the I-8

01:30:58.526 --> 01:30:59.560
in a stolen car.

01:30:59.593 --> 01:31:00.561
He's high on meth.

01:31:00.594 --> 01:31:02.830
He hasn't seen another car

01:31:02.863 --> 01:31:04.207
that's pulled over
on the shoulder.

01:31:04.231 --> 01:31:05.866
A mom and her ten-year-old son.

01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:08.669
Coming home from Legoland.
They got a flat tire.

01:31:08.703 --> 01:31:10.213
But Colvey, he doesn't
see that the woman

01:31:10.237 --> 01:31:11.973
is out there changing the tire.

01:31:12.006 --> 01:31:14.875
He just plows right into her.
Kills her.

01:31:14.909 --> 01:31:16.644
Now, he stops his car

01:31:16.677 --> 01:31:18.980
and he sees behind him
the boy's jumped out.

01:31:19.013 --> 01:31:20.581
He's obviously screaming.

01:31:20.614 --> 01:31:24.085
Seeing his mom, dead
on the road, crying for help.

01:31:24.118 --> 01:31:25.953
But Colvey doesn't help.

01:31:25.987 --> 01:31:29.256
He puts his car in reverse
and backs over the boy.

01:31:29.290 --> 01:31:31.993
Making sure
there's no witnesses.

01:31:32.026 --> 01:31:34.795
Then he torches his car
two miles down the road.

01:31:34.829 --> 01:31:37.098
But a 15-year-old girl,
she sees him.

01:31:37.131 --> 01:31:40.801
She sees a man walking away
from a big fire with a gas can.

01:31:40.835 --> 01:31:42.203
Now, it ain't much,
but it's enough

01:31:42.236 --> 01:31:44.205
to put Colvey on trial.

01:31:44.238 --> 01:31:46.107
You know what happened?

01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:47.675
They do a photo line-up.

01:31:47.708 --> 01:31:50.144
But the girl,
she doesn't pick Colvey.

01:31:50.177 --> 01:31:51.545
So they do an in-person,

01:31:51.579 --> 01:31:53.280
and again
she doesn't pick Colvey,

01:31:53.314 --> 01:31:56.017
even though everybody
knows it's him.

01:31:56.050 --> 01:31:57.618
Three times, three line-ups.

01:31:57.651 --> 01:31:59.887
Each time she picks
a different guy.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.756
And Colvey walks.

01:32:01.789 --> 01:32:03.691
And he's still out there.

01:32:05.326 --> 01:32:06.894
So...

01:32:08.162 --> 01:32:10.631
memory's a motherfucker.

01:32:10.664 --> 01:32:12.133
And as for justice...

01:32:16.170 --> 01:32:18.072
it ain't guaranteed.

01:32:20.808 --> 01:32:22.676
Your wife.

01:32:26.814 --> 01:32:28.082
Your son.

01:32:37.992 --> 01:32:40.561
I have evidence.

01:32:42.963 --> 01:32:45.633
Yeah? What evidence do you got?

01:32:45.666 --> 01:32:49.670
A phone call. Davana Sealman.

01:32:49.703 --> 01:32:51.872
Threatening...

01:32:51.906 --> 01:32:55.076
Threatening the first man
I killed.

01:32:55.109 --> 01:32:56.677
Ellis Van Camp?

01:32:56.710 --> 01:33:01.715
Yes. I have that call
on a... flip...

01:33:01.749 --> 01:33:02.950
- Flash?
- Flash.

01:33:02.983 --> 01:33:05.052
- Flash drive?
- Flash drive.

01:33:05.086 --> 01:33:06.787
Where is it?

01:33:09.023 --> 01:33:11.258
I don't know.

01:33:11.292 --> 01:33:13.060
Help, help me...

01:33:14.228 --> 01:33:15.996
Help me remember.

01:33:17.331 --> 01:33:19.133
Please.

01:33:19.166 --> 01:33:20.734
We will.

01:33:21.902 --> 01:33:23.604
We will.

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:28.142
That makes me sick
to my stomach.

01:33:29.877 --> 01:33:32.246
I'm glad that bastard is dead.

01:33:32.279 --> 01:33:35.182
His mother was covering for him.

01:33:35.216 --> 01:33:37.251
- Davana Sealman?
- Yeah.

01:33:37.284 --> 01:33:39.887
That woman hasn't had
a parking ticket in her life.

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:43.090
She knew that her son
was raping minors.

01:33:43.124 --> 01:33:45.426
She also paid for the hit
on Ellis Van Camp.

01:33:45.459 --> 01:33:47.161
Based on what evidence?

01:33:47.194 --> 01:33:50.030
The man she hired, Alex Lewis.
He made it very clear to me...

01:33:50.064 --> 01:33:52.299
Oh, the testimony
of a professional killer?

01:33:52.333 --> 01:33:54.368
Alex Lewis was hired
by William Borden

01:33:54.401 --> 01:33:55.703
for Davana Sealman.

01:33:55.736 --> 01:33:56.704
Isn't this the same man

01:33:56.737 --> 01:33:57.814
who has some kind of dementia?

01:33:57.838 --> 01:33:59.006
Advanced Alzheimer's.

01:33:59.039 --> 01:33:59.673
Yeah, yeah.

01:33:59.707 --> 01:34:01.308
Look, I need real evidence.

01:34:01.342 --> 01:34:03.010
Alright, not just
the fucking testimony

01:34:03.043 --> 01:34:06.180
of some murderer who's
cognitively impaired. Jesus.

01:34:06.213 --> 01:34:08.415
Any decent lawyer would
annihilate him on the stand.

01:34:08.449 --> 01:34:10.384
Listen, apparently,
there's a recording

01:34:10.417 --> 01:34:12.153
of Davana Sealman
on a phone call

01:34:12.186 --> 01:34:14.822
explicitly threatening Van Camp.

01:34:14.855 --> 01:34:18.058
- Well, that I can use.
- I'm working on it.

01:34:18.092 --> 01:34:20.161
Well, you bring me the audio,
and if it's solid,

01:34:20.194 --> 01:34:22.029
I'll make the case.

01:34:22.062 --> 01:34:23.797
Thank you, sir.

01:34:29.837 --> 01:34:31.138
Are you sure you're up for this?

01:34:31.172 --> 01:34:34.808
No, Gerald. I'm definitely
fucking not up for this.

01:34:47.955 --> 01:34:49.156
Alex.

01:34:50.424 --> 01:34:53.227
Listen. We need to find
that recording.

01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:56.797
Without that,
they... they can't bring charges.

01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:58.732
Do you remember where it is?

01:35:00.367 --> 01:35:02.236
I... I've been trying
to remember.

01:35:02.269 --> 01:35:04.104
Okay.

01:35:04.138 --> 01:35:06.307
I can't.

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:08.776
It's lost.

01:35:10.311 --> 01:35:13.080
I... I used to make notes. Here.

01:35:13.113 --> 01:35:16.283
- Mm-hm.
- There's no more notes.

01:35:17.785 --> 01:35:20.087
I'm sorry. Really. I'm sorry.

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:22.456
Listen. Without that recording,

01:35:22.489 --> 01:35:24.225
there's no case against Sealman.

01:35:25.893 --> 01:35:28.262
And there's nothing that I
or anybody can do about it.

01:35:28.295 --> 01:35:29.830
Do you understand that?

01:35:32.299 --> 01:35:34.735
I need you to remember.

01:35:46.413 --> 01:35:48.816
Dr. Myers. I have a writ...

01:35:48.849 --> 01:35:51.252
I know, we got a call
you were coming.

01:36:25.919 --> 01:36:29.490
No alcohol swab?

01:36:48.208 --> 01:36:50.110
Hey, hold up.

01:36:50.144 --> 01:36:51.584
Your SAC said,
he doesn't go through.

01:36:51.613 --> 01:36:53.213
- He's with us.
- Can't do it.

01:36:53.247 --> 01:36:55.049
He said for you
to head right in.

01:36:55.082 --> 01:36:58.520
It's okay, man. Just take care.

01:37:07.562 --> 01:37:09.363
He's got a hostage.

01:37:09.396 --> 01:37:11.832
This is a fucking mess, Serra.

01:37:19.373 --> 01:37:21.442
His only demand...

01:37:21.475 --> 01:37:23.344
is to talk to you.

01:37:36.056 --> 01:37:38.192
Hey.

01:37:38.225 --> 01:37:40.060
Watch your ass.

01:38:14.962 --> 01:38:16.664
They're coming out.

01:38:16.698 --> 01:38:18.465
Hold fire.

01:38:22.704 --> 01:38:24.539
That's Myers.

01:38:24.572 --> 01:38:27.908
Sniper two, do you have a shot
on the subject on the right?

01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:31.044
Affirmative.

01:38:34.248 --> 01:38:35.717
Agent Serra, status?

01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:37.719
You killed the hostage.
Stand down. Stand down!

01:38:37.752 --> 01:38:39.687
Listen to me, Agent Serra,
tactical...

01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:43.157
They sent that man to kill me.

01:38:43.190 --> 01:38:45.292
He walked right past the cops.

01:38:45.325 --> 01:38:47.562
That bitch owns the whole game.

01:38:47.595 --> 01:38:49.296
She doesn't own the FBI.

01:38:52.132 --> 01:38:53.611
- Are you sure about that?
- Listen to me.

01:38:53.635 --> 01:38:55.603
Maybe they'll kill you, too.
Just to...

01:38:55.637 --> 01:38:57.539
Just to b... b... Bury this.

01:38:57.572 --> 01:39:00.007
Yeah, maybe. Alex. Listen...

01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:05.145
Bery. That's spelled B-E-R-Y.

01:39:05.179 --> 01:39:08.215
- No. Alex.
- Right? Yes. Yes. Bery.

01:39:08.248 --> 01:39:10.317
B-E-R-Y.

01:39:11.653 --> 01:39:14.622
You said justice
can't be guaranteed.

01:39:14.656 --> 01:39:16.223
No.

01:39:16.256 --> 01:39:19.293
We owe it to that child,
Vincent.

01:39:21.796 --> 01:39:24.064
Alex.

01:39:24.097 --> 01:39:26.668
Alex! Alex!

01:40:10.377 --> 01:40:12.279
They won't let Hugo
in the building.

01:40:12.312 --> 01:40:14.114
God, I bet Nussbaum deports him.

01:40:14.147 --> 01:40:17.017
Yeah. Nothing would surprise me.

01:40:18.352 --> 01:40:19.754
Where are they sending you?

01:40:19.787 --> 01:40:21.723
Crimes against Children.

01:40:21.756 --> 01:40:24.391
- You?
- Unassigned.

01:40:24.424 --> 01:40:27.294
Vincent, your heart
was in the right place.

01:40:41.609 --> 01:40:43.745
He fucking remembered.

01:40:43.778 --> 01:40:45.613
He fucking remembered!

01:41:10.872 --> 01:41:13.140
You've left me no choice.

01:41:13.173 --> 01:41:15.175
I won't be cut out.

01:41:15.208 --> 01:41:16.452
Look, this doesn't
have to be ugly.

01:41:16.476 --> 01:41:18.345
Blackmail is already ugly.

01:41:18.378 --> 01:41:20.715
- Look, all...
- Mr. Van Camp!

01:41:20.748 --> 01:41:22.584
We are not negotiating.

01:41:22.617 --> 01:41:25.452
You've crossed the line
from which there is no return.

01:41:26.621 --> 01:41:28.656
That's it.

01:41:28.690 --> 01:41:30.758
It's not enough.

01:41:30.792 --> 01:41:32.259
What are you talking about?

01:41:32.292 --> 01:41:33.528
Well, Alex Lewis is dead.

01:41:33.561 --> 01:41:35.262
Without him,
I don't have corroboration.

01:41:35.295 --> 01:41:36.607
You said, if I bring you
this recording...

01:41:36.631 --> 01:41:40.167
No, no, no, no. The recording
is a threat. Yes.

01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:41.736
Without the hitman,
it's not enough.

01:41:41.769 --> 01:41:43.605
Come on, man, this is a case.

01:41:43.638 --> 01:41:45.607
It's not a case I can win.

01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:47.609
I'm very sorry, Vincent.

01:41:53.881 --> 01:41:55.349
You're kidding me?

01:41:55.382 --> 01:41:58.452
Look, when you're dealing
with that kind of money,

01:41:58.485 --> 01:42:00.822
even if I had her
handing the gun to Alex

01:42:00.855 --> 01:42:03.725
and paying him,
she'd probably still win.

01:42:04.726 --> 01:42:07.160
Okay. Okay.

01:42:07.194 --> 01:42:10.130
Yeah, the sooner you
realize that, the better.

01:42:11.198 --> 01:42:12.667
Listen, you tell me something.

01:42:13.868 --> 01:42:16.336
Beatriz Leon.

01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:18.271
What does she mean to you, huh?

01:42:18.305 --> 01:42:20.374
Just some lowlife Mexican kid,

01:42:20.407 --> 01:42:21.909
who's probably gonna die anyway?

01:42:21.943 --> 01:42:23.276
No, not at all.

01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:24.646
Randy Sealman
would take children

01:42:24.679 --> 01:42:25.780
out of his Detention Centre

01:42:25.813 --> 01:42:27.314
and use them
as his fucking sex toys.

01:42:27.347 --> 01:42:28.816
Problem is, we can't prove it.

01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:31.451
You know what's going on.
We all know what's going on.

01:42:31.485 --> 01:42:32.319
Serra!

01:42:32.352 --> 01:42:33.788
You're nothing
but a fucking coward.

01:42:33.821 --> 01:42:35.355
Okay, that's it, Serra!

01:42:35.389 --> 01:42:37.792
A lot of people,
myself included, are fed up!

01:42:37.825 --> 01:42:39.292
Yeah.

01:42:39.326 --> 01:42:41.294
Time to take a leave, Serra.

01:42:41.328 --> 01:42:43.397
Make it a long one.

01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:45.967
And then let's re-evaluate.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.102
With pleasure.

01:43:06.954 --> 01:43:08.623
- Yo.
- Hey.

01:43:08.656 --> 01:43:10.892
We should celebrate
your suspension.

01:43:10.925 --> 01:43:12.694
I'm not really up for it.

01:43:12.727 --> 01:43:14.696
I wasn't asking, dipshit.

01:43:14.729 --> 01:43:16.698
Get some fucking clothes on.

01:43:42.623 --> 01:43:44.491
Since when have you
been so social?

01:43:44.525 --> 01:43:46.460
I'm trying to turn over
a new leaf.

01:43:46.493 --> 01:43:48.996
I mean, you can't be an
asshole forever, right?

01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:50.598
I don't know.

01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:37.545
- Hey!
- No, no, no.

01:44:37.578 --> 01:44:40.081
Anymore and I'm fucking
toast tomorrow.

01:44:40.114 --> 01:44:41.816
Don't be a pussy.

01:44:41.849 --> 01:44:43.851
It's not like you've got a job.

01:44:43.885 --> 01:44:46.521
I'm good.

01:44:46.554 --> 01:44:47.722
Alright.

01:44:49.690 --> 01:44:52.292
Oh, shit. I spaced my wallet.

01:44:53.694 --> 01:44:55.797
Sorry. I'll owe you.

01:44:56.731 --> 01:44:58.365
Asshole.

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:02.335
Sol?

01:45:02.369 --> 01:45:04.872
Murdered
just hours ago at her home.

01:45:04.906 --> 01:45:07.340
According to an El Paso
Police Department spokesmen,

01:45:07.374 --> 01:45:09.677
there are presently no suspects
and no witnesses.

01:45:09.710 --> 01:45:12.947
Details are sketchy at this
point. El Paso Police only...

01:45:20.087 --> 01:45:21.421
What's going on?

01:45:29.096 --> 01:45:31.398
Did you just give me an alibi?

01:45:32.867 --> 01:45:34.569
Amen.
