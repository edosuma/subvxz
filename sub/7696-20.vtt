WEBVTT

02:14.675 --> 02:16.552
A piece of cake.
Just like the boss said.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.804
Yeah, all it took was five minutes.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.182
And that will get you
five years.

02:22.725 --> 02:24.060
With good behavior.

03:13.984 --> 03:15.361
Bird seed?

03:21.492 --> 03:23.994
Hey, Roberta,
it's got a walkie-talkie wrist band.

03:24.328 --> 03:27.665
A pen light, binoculars,
even this cool badge.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.292
Yo, Sherwood, what you got there?

03:30.876 --> 03:32.378
It's a junior detective kit.

03:32.753 --> 03:34.171
And the name's Sherman.

03:34.755 --> 03:37.341
A fake, just like you, wormwood.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.385
Whoa. Check this out.

03:39.468 --> 03:40.469
A hawk.

03:41.053 --> 03:43.180
Come on, Frank. Those are mine.

03:43.389 --> 03:44.890
Come on. Give it back.

03:45.266 --> 03:48.269
Can't you find any of your
own species to play with?

03:49.186 --> 03:52.064
Ah, don't pitch a fit.
We're just kidding around.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.818
Hey, that's no hawk.

03:56.235 --> 03:59.029
Judging by its wingspread
and the shape of its head,

03:59.447 --> 04:02.116
it's obviously a giant
South American vulture.

04:02.616 --> 04:05.077
A vulture, in Gotham City?

04:05.745 --> 04:07.246
Sure thing, Sherlock.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.914
Come on, Roberta.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.959
Sherman, where are we going?

04:12.501 --> 04:15.671
A vulture in Gotham City
is a mystery worth checking out.

04:29.351 --> 04:31.020
Come on, Roberta. It went in there.

04:38.027 --> 04:41.197
Sherman, the sign says it's condemned.
You shouldn't go in.

04:43.824 --> 04:44.825
Men.

04:54.043 --> 04:55.044
I don't like it.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.630
Cop a squat and dummy up, Jay.

04:57.880 --> 05:01.133
If the boss said to meet him back here,
we meet him here.

05:02.218 --> 05:03.969
What's that?

05:10.434 --> 05:12.895
It's just birdseed, birdbrain.

05:19.735 --> 05:21.403
Come on, let's get out of here.

05:30.830 --> 05:31.914
The Penguin.

05:38.003 --> 05:40.464
Aw, Scrap, my faithful pet.

05:41.006 --> 05:43.092
Ready for a ripe repast?

05:48.931 --> 05:51.600
That bald buzzard gives me the willies.

05:52.059 --> 05:53.394
If it weren't for Scrap,

05:53.477 --> 05:57.106
you two would be feathering
your nest at Stonegate Penitentiary.

05:57.481 --> 05:59.775
Now, where is it?

06:05.114 --> 06:10.744
Oh, how much more doth beauty
beauteous seem by this sweet egg,

06:11.036 --> 06:13.247
which we have scrambled for?

06:13.873 --> 06:16.500
They stole the Vonalster FabergÃ© Egg.

06:17.042 --> 06:18.043
The what?

06:18.544 --> 06:20.296
Don't you read the papers?

06:20.838 --> 06:22.298
Do the comics count?

06:26.343 --> 06:28.012
That thing's worth a fortune.

06:28.220 --> 06:29.430
We gotta tell someone.

06:47.948 --> 06:48.949
Batman!

06:49.491 --> 06:51.410
Get that capon crusader.

06:56.206 --> 06:57.207
Batman.

07:28.530 --> 07:30.282
Get out. Now!

07:30.991 --> 07:32.451
Yes, sir.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.467
You should have taken your own advice.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.667
Batman's in trouble. Come on.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.086
I don't know about this.

08:29.925 --> 08:33.387
It's those delinquents.
Stop them!

08:42.938 --> 08:45.816
- Quick, inside.
- Sherman, do something.

09:20.017 --> 09:21.560
We gotta get out of here.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.103
What am I doing?

09:23.395 --> 09:25.147
I'm not old enough to drive.

09:29.526 --> 09:31.361
I can't reach the pedals.

09:31.862 --> 09:32.988
I can.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.743
Push that long one.

09:59.807 --> 10:00.808
Hit it again.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.566
Okay, Roberta, floor it.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.182
Be-fowled by a couple of fledglings.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.353
Keep it going, Roberta.

10:46.728 --> 10:48.689
I think I'm starting
to get the hang of this.

10:54.444 --> 10:56.989
Come on, Batman.
This will help.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.291
It's okay.

11:10.669 --> 11:13.130
My name is Sherman.
And I'm a detective, too.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.299
We're lying low in my basement.

11:17.509 --> 11:18.510
We got the egg down here, too.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.972
See, this is my crime lab.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.849
It's not exactly the Batcave.

11:24.099 --> 11:25.517
Capsule.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.187
"Cap" what?

11:29.021 --> 11:30.898
No, you're not captured, Batman.

11:31.315 --> 11:33.817
You're safe here.
It's just Mom and me.

11:34.151 --> 11:35.360
And she's at work.

11:37.654 --> 11:39.948
Oh, yeah. And Roberta's here.
She's cool.

11:40.741 --> 11:41.742
No-

11:42.910 --> 11:44.203
Visor.

11:46.955 --> 11:48.498
Wonder what that meant.

11:48.916 --> 11:52.085
Don't look at me.
I've had enough mystery for one day.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.546
- I'm calling the police.
- No way.

11:55.047 --> 11:58.425
A detective always has to protect
the identity of his client,

11:58.926 --> 12:00.719
especially when it's this client.

12:14.775 --> 12:18.070
Those meddling brats
couldn't have gotten too far.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.280
But, boss, what about the Batman?

12:20.530 --> 12:24.618
Batman's a worm, less than nothing,
a worthless peasant.

12:25.244 --> 12:29.790
And besides, the gas will keep him null
and void for a good week.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.343
Sherman, what are you doing down there?

12:41.635 --> 12:42.886
Nothing, Mom.

12:43.220 --> 12:46.098
You're not trying to make
gunpowder again, are you?

12:46.890 --> 12:48.350
No, Mom, honest.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.686
We saved Batman's life, Mrs. Grant,

12:50.936 --> 12:53.063
and now we're hiding him
from some bad criminals.

12:53.438 --> 12:56.233
That's good, just don't make a mess.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.027
Nice going, Miss Bigmouth.

12:59.444 --> 13:01.613
Sorry, Sherman.
I guess I panicked.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.831
I'm going to the store, Sherman.

13:10.914 --> 13:12.374
Stay out of trouble.

13:12.749 --> 13:13.917
Sure thing, Mom.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.010
Afternoon, Mrs. Grant.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.137
Lovely day, isn't it?

13:28.473 --> 13:30.892
He's up! He shoots! It looks good!

13:35.188 --> 13:36.898
Oh, no!

13:39.109 --> 13:42.446
Man, oh, man! Scope out these wheels.

13:42.904 --> 13:44.656
You guys
better leave that alone.

13:44.948 --> 13:47.909
Oh, Golly, we sure are scared,
aren't we, Nicholas?

13:48.452 --> 13:52.956
Oh, yes, Francis, we certainly are.
Step aside, Shirley.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.586
Cool. Whose car is this?

13:57.794 --> 14:00.005
It's my mom's-- My uncle's.

14:03.508 --> 14:05.552
All right, look, it's the Batmobile.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.429
Yeah, right.

14:08.055 --> 14:11.099
Hey, I don't think he's kidding.

14:11.683 --> 14:12.684
What's this?

14:15.645 --> 14:17.022
Some kind of capsules.

14:17.564 --> 14:18.565
Capsule?

14:19.316 --> 14:22.778
Capsule on the visor.
That's what he meant.

14:23.570 --> 14:26.114
Give me that!
It's a matter of life or death.

14:53.266 --> 14:54.684
No!

15:02.526 --> 15:04.319
Whoa!

15:08.240 --> 15:09.783
Come on, Batman, wake up.

15:17.290 --> 15:18.291
It's him!

15:20.168 --> 15:21.586
Totally awesome.

15:22.629 --> 15:24.214
I wonder who he really is.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.049
No! Get back.

15:28.009 --> 15:29.636
This isn't a game, you jerks.

15:30.011 --> 15:33.640
If the vulture's here that means
the Penguin will be right on his tail.

15:33.932 --> 15:35.058
The Penguin?

15:35.434 --> 15:38.186
Oh, no! What's that?

15:38.270 --> 15:40.480
Oh, great! It's him.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.494
That's it. I'm calling 911.

15:59.833 --> 16:00.834
It's dead.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.175
So much for phone calls, huh, boss?

16:10.510 --> 16:12.596
Then it's them or us.

16:12.929 --> 16:14.556
Be careful with that egg, Roberta.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.267
I bet we can find
something here to help us.

16:23.815 --> 16:25.233
I don't think anyone's home.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.277
Yeah, the place is locked up tight.

16:27.611 --> 16:32.240
Stone walls do not a prison make
nor locked doors a barricade.

16:38.330 --> 16:42.000
Gentlemen,
and I use the term loosely,

16:42.667 --> 16:43.960
after you.

16:53.011 --> 16:56.264
Okay, get ready for operation Fowl Play.

17:01.561 --> 17:03.313
How bourgeois.

17:03.647 --> 17:06.775
Tearing this place apart
could only improve it.

17:08.860 --> 17:11.071
Let the egg hunt begin.

17:29.589 --> 17:31.758
Hey, Raven, are you okay?

17:36.012 --> 17:39.057
These commoners
have such cheap furniture.

17:45.605 --> 17:47.649
Come on, Batman, snap out of it.

17:47.857 --> 17:50.569
If that didn't wake him,
I don't know what will.

17:53.738 --> 17:56.366
Charge! Now, Roberta!

18:01.955 --> 18:03.123
Nice shot.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.543
Be careful, Roberta,
you don't wanna get too close.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.420
We did it.

18:08.670 --> 18:13.508
Children defending their nest.
How noble. How endearing.

18:14.676 --> 18:16.469
How ineffective.

18:16.928 --> 18:18.388
Grab the little pests.

18:36.656 --> 18:38.199
He's not awake yet?

18:38.992 --> 18:40.785
Frank thought he saw his eye blink.

18:51.087 --> 18:53.840
Valiant effort, but I win.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.010
Now, back away, you irksome imps.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.224
Ah.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.101
A treat with my egg.

19:06.853 --> 19:09.481
Sliced ham.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.068
No-

19:13.610 --> 19:15.403
Farewell, Bat-vermin.

19:19.866 --> 19:20.867
Batman!

19:23.953 --> 19:25.080
Back off, Penguin.

19:28.833 --> 19:31.628
Gentlemen, your timing is impeccable.

19:32.545 --> 19:34.005
Take no prisoners!

19:54.859 --> 19:58.196
I'II clip your wings, you flying rodent.

20:30.854 --> 20:33.481
Still a little dazed, are we?

20:45.744 --> 20:47.120
We're safe!

20:47.370 --> 20:51.040
- My house!
- Sherman!

20:51.875 --> 20:53.168
Maybe you're safe.

20:53.793 --> 20:56.546
Young man, you've got some
serious explaining to do.

20:58.465 --> 21:01.342
Uh, Mom, I'd like you to meet Batman.

21:01.718 --> 21:03.094
Batman, this is my mom.

21:03.803 --> 21:04.804
Ma'am.

21:05.138 --> 21:06.264
Uh, hello.

21:07.432 --> 21:10.477
Say, Batman, you wouldn't be single,
would you?

21:22.447 --> 21:23.907
Now, where was I?

21:24.532 --> 21:26.743
Someone keeps swiping
Mr. Vanducci's newspaper?

21:27.202 --> 21:28.203
Right, Frank.

21:28.411 --> 21:29.788
You and Nick set up for surveillance.

21:30.622 --> 21:33.833
Roberta and I will be over at
Mrs. Fineman's. Her dog is missing.

21:34.751 --> 21:35.877
You're the boss.

21:36.336 --> 21:37.337
Sherman.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.041
English - SDH
