WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:01.750
I do as they tell me
and the street is safe.

00:01.800 --> 00:03.110
Who are they?

00:03.160 --> 00:06.190
I never meant for anyone to get hurt.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.039
Let me be brave.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.910
Is it a trap? Is it a torture chamber?

00:11.960 --> 00:14.950
If you want any part of killing
her and you're not afraid,

00:15.000 --> 00:17.670
then you understand nothing at all.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.470
'Go to the city.'

00:23.520 --> 00:25.550
Tell them I'm back.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.200
Tell them... I know what they did.

Hi.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.230
What can I get you?

01:25.280 --> 01:27.420
I don't have any money.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.220
But I play.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.100
OK.

01:38.120 --> 01:40.830
Don't you need to plug that thing in?

01:40.880 --> 01:42.150
Yeah.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.420
You're English.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.820
You're not.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.840
- How did you get out here?
- Magic.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.630
Or... maybe I went to an
airport and caught a plane.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.070
Ah.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.320
You?

02:03.080 --> 02:04.350
Magic.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.310
I believe you.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.510
You been travelling?

02:18.560 --> 02:20.700
Yeah, from time to time.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.590
Is it a sad song?

02:31.640 --> 02:33.430
Nothing's sad till it's over.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.420
Then everything is.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.440
What's it called?

02:44.920 --> 02:46.990
I think that it's called...

02:47.040 --> 02:48.440
.. Clara.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.750
Tell me about her.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.540
Lord President?

04:16.959 --> 04:18.550
Are all the bells ringing?

04:18.600 --> 04:20.540
The whole cloister?

04:21.040 --> 04:23.310
What's going on down there?

04:25.160 --> 04:27.550
On my way down to the Matrix now, sir.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.550
"Keep the perimeter. It's OK to
be afraid down there, soldier."

04:30.600 --> 04:33.390
Sliders are everywhere,
sir. Loads of the things.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.830
"Language, please. I'm
with the President."

04:35.880 --> 04:38.310
Sorry, sir. The Cloister
Wraiths are active.

04:38.360 --> 04:41.310
Do not approach them, don't even
enter the cloister, just tell me,

04:41.360 --> 04:43.110
"are all the bells ringing?"

04:43.160 --> 04:44.590
Yes, sir.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.870
Then we are facing great danger.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.070
The Cloister Wraiths seem to think so.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.920
So, where is he?

04:51.480 --> 04:52.830
Where has the Doctor gone?

04:52.880 --> 04:54.870
Back to the beginning, I should think.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.630
The Sisterhood of Karn has
no business in this chamber,

04:58.680 --> 05:00.310
or on this planet.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.510
I heard the Doctor had come home.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.700
One so loves fireworks!

05:40.840 --> 05:44.430
Why are they ringing all the
bells? Never heard so many.

05:44.480 --> 05:48.280
What's gone wrong this time? All
the fuss they're always making.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.950
You, up there! You're not
supposed to be there!

05:52.000 --> 05:53.350
I've just put all that back,

05:53.400 --> 05:57.040
it's for the boys, if any
of them ever want to come...

06:07.000 --> 06:08.800
They'll kill you.

06:53.760 --> 06:54.910
'Attention!

06:54.960 --> 06:59.060
'Will all non-military personnel
step away from the Doctor.'

07:02.120 --> 07:03.670
I repeat...

07:03.720 --> 07:07.990
all non-military personnel,
please, step away from the Doctor.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.040
'At least move the children away!'

07:12.760 --> 07:16.430
Doctor, you will lay down
any weapons on your person

07:16.480 --> 07:19.020
and accompany us to the capital.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.100
'Doctor, you will accompany
us to the capital.'

08:02.160 --> 08:03.960
'Doctor?'

08:06.680 --> 08:08.270
Come back.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.870
You will come back immediately.

08:09.920 --> 08:13.420
'That is an order and this
is a military vehicle.'

08:20.280 --> 08:22.110
What's his plan?

08:22.160 --> 08:24.700
I think he's finishing his soup.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.390
Suggestion, sir...

08:28.440 --> 08:30.670
'We could talk to him.'

08:30.720 --> 08:32.860
'Words are his weapons.'

08:33.400 --> 08:35.940
'When did they stop being ours?'

09:07.440 --> 09:09.310
Welcome home, sir.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.710
As commander of the armed
forces of Gallifrey,

09:12.760 --> 09:16.160
I bring you the greetings
of the High Council

09:22.080 --> 09:25.190
'Who the hell does he think he is?'

09:25.240 --> 09:27.840
The man who won the Time War, sir.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.040
What is he doing?

10:01.840 --> 10:03.710
What does he want?

10:04.520 --> 10:06.110
Revenge?

10:06.160 --> 10:09.470
The Doctor does not blame Gallifrey
for the horrors of the Time War.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.390
I should hope not.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.440
He just blames you.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.760
Get off my planet.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.000
We needed to know.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.790
You have information about the Hybrid.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.990
A danger to all of us.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.750
If you'd told us what you knew,
you could've walked out of there.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.800
Get off my planet.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.150
You have nothing, Doctor.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.600
Nothing!

11:47.720 --> 11:50.950
Do you know what I have,
out here in the Dry Lands,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.470
where there's nobody who matters?

11:53.520 --> 11:55.320
No witnesses.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.080
Me, too.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.240
Take aim!

12:03.680 --> 12:05.550
Aim at the Doctor.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.960
- Fire on my command.
- Sir?

12:10.520 --> 12:13.430
Step forward and take aim!

12:13.480 --> 12:15.070
What's the matter with you?

12:15.120 --> 12:17.880
Lord President... he's a war hero.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.400
- Some of these men served with him.
- These men serve me!

12:23.960 --> 12:25.500
All of you!

12:29.360 --> 12:31.160
On my command...

12:47.880 --> 12:49.480
Fire!

12:53.920 --> 12:56.190
'Could I have a lemonade?'

12:57.520 --> 13:00.320
Oh, you like a cliffhanger, don't you?

13:01.520 --> 13:04.390
So you went back to your home town...

13:04.440 --> 13:06.030
Something like that.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.950
Glasgow?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.270
Er, well, sort of Glasgow. Space Glasgow.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.990
And there was this gang boss
and he wanted to kill you.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.840
Wanted to, yeah.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.780
You missed!

13:35.400 --> 13:36.470
All of you!

13:36.520 --> 13:39.350
Every single one of you!
How is that possible?

13:39.400 --> 13:41.350
What is it?

13:41.400 --> 13:45.440
Is the firing squad
afraid of the unarmed man?

13:46.920 --> 13:48.920
You... explain.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.510
There was a saying, sir, in the Time War.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.750
A saying?

13:53.800 --> 13:57.280
The first thing you will notice
about the Doctor of War...

13:58.400 --> 14:00.340
.. is he's unarmed.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.240
For many, it's also the last.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.480
I was at Skull Moon, sir.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.470
Is this a story or did this really happen?

14:33.520 --> 14:36.360
Every story ever told really happened.

14:37.880 --> 14:41.480
Stories... are where memories
go when they're forgotten.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.540
Not one more of you
moves! That is an order!

14:53.320 --> 14:55.920
A direct order of your President!

14:59.920 --> 15:02.320
You leave me no choice.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.040
How many regenerations did we grant you?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.940
I've got all night.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.510
Excellent, General. You
sent for reinforcements.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.230
No, he didn't.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.480
I did.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.390
What?

15:33.440 --> 15:35.240
I am Rassilon...

15:35.960 --> 15:37.760
.. the redeemer!

15:39.640 --> 15:42.070
Rassilon, the resurrected!

15:42.120 --> 15:44.920
Gallifrey is mine!

15:46.800 --> 15:48.600
Lord President...

15:49.480 --> 15:51.350
.. with respect...

15:51.640 --> 15:53.710
.. get off his planet.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.350
Gallifrey is currently positioned

16:15.400 --> 16:18.440
at the extreme end of the time
continuum, for its own protection.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.750
We're at the end of the universe,

16:21.800 --> 16:23.670
give or take a star system.

16:23.720 --> 16:24.950
I know.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.270
I came the long way round.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.680
The President may not find anywhere to go.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.110
He's not the President any more.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.300
He was a good man once.

16:39.960 --> 16:43.030
Isn't this... going a little far?

16:43.080 --> 16:45.310
Oh, I've barely started.

16:45.360 --> 16:48.920
Tell the High Council
they're on the next shuttle.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.950
I thought I'd find you down here.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.560
Old times.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.069
You're a long way from Karn.

17:13.119 --> 17:16.680
At the end of everything, one must
expect the company of immortals.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.589
Do you know what they did to me?

17:19.640 --> 17:23.109
A confession dial is a
ritual act of purification.

17:23.160 --> 17:26.510
It allows a dying Time Lord to
face his demons and make his peace,

17:26.560 --> 17:29.560
before his mind is uploaded to the Matrix.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.350
It was never intended as a
torture chamber for the living.

17:33.400 --> 17:37.270
Rassilon grew concerned about
the coming of the Hybrid.

17:37.320 --> 17:41.150
- Afraid! - You were entrapped
and imprisoned at his command.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.310
And look at him now.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.830
Why did you banish him? Was it punishment?

17:45.880 --> 17:47.750
Or for your own protection?

17:47.800 --> 17:50.140
Or are you just being cruel?

17:50.520 --> 17:52.190
Or just being cowardly?

17:52.240 --> 17:54.180
Let's see, shall we?

17:55.480 --> 17:59.070
If you wanted to know about the
Hybrid, why didn't you just ask me?

17:59.120 --> 18:01.270
If the Hybrid is a threat
to the people of this world,

18:01.320 --> 18:02.790
why don't you just tell us?

18:02.840 --> 18:05.040
What do you know already?

18:06.480 --> 18:09.280
- The Hybrid is a legendary...
- No.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.830
The Hybrid is a creature thought to
be crossbred from two warrior races.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.480
Which races?

18:16.360 --> 18:18.350
The Daleks and the Time
Lords, it is supposed.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.990
Oh, must be well hard, then.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.790
Unstoppable.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.350
According to the stories.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.470
If they're just stories,
why are you so worried?

18:26.520 --> 18:28.910
Some Matrix prophecies suggest...

18:28.960 --> 18:30.960
No.

18:32.840 --> 18:35.510
- Many prophesies suggest...
- No.

18:38.880 --> 18:42.190
All... Matrix prophecies concur

18:42.240 --> 18:46.550
that this creature will one day
stand in the ruins of Gallifrey.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.190
It will unravel the web of time

18:49.240 --> 18:52.550
and destroy a billion billion
hearts to heal its own.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.470
What colour is it?

18:55.680 --> 18:56.830
I don't know.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.550
Prophecies, they never tell
you anything useful, do they?

18:59.600 --> 19:01.390
This is no time to play the fool.

19:01.440 --> 19:04.030
It's the end of the universe.
It's the only time I've got.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.670
- And you want me to keep
you all safe. - Can you?

19:06.720 --> 19:08.990
I'll need help, obviously.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.670
Gallifrey is at your command.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.720
Oh, not from you lot. No, you'd
cramp my style. Look at your hats.

19:15.920 --> 19:19.790
I'm going to need the use of an
extraction chamber, to talk...

19:19.840 --> 19:21.760
to an old friend.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.790
Let me be brave...

19:51.160 --> 19:53.110
This way.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.900
I can save you.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.390
- Doctor? - Yeah. - Where am I?

20:19.440 --> 20:21.630
- Is this the TARDIS?
- No.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.990
- This is a planet.
- What planet?

20:24.040 --> 20:25.430
Basically, my place.

20:25.480 --> 20:28.280
I was about to die. I should be dead.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.750
Forget about that. It doesn't matter.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.110
- Hang on, your place?
- Yeah.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.790
- What do you mean, your place?
- My place.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.150
- You don't mean...?
- Yeah.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.430
Gallifrey...

20:36.480 --> 20:37.950
Gallifrey.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.670
OK. Er...

20:40.720 --> 20:42.190
Hang on. Wait. What?

20:42.240 --> 20:43.710
What? Did I miss something?

20:43.760 --> 20:45.750
Well, we're several billion
years in the future

20:45.800 --> 20:48.270
and the universe is pretty much
over, so, yeah, quite a lot.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.590
Young lady, Miss Oswald...

20:50.640 --> 20:54.240
I'm afraid we only have a
very few minutes with you.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.310
Who's he?

20:57.360 --> 20:59.710
According to the Doctor, you
can tell us something about

20:59.760 --> 21:01.390
the creature known as the Hybrid.

21:01.440 --> 21:02.670
Oh...

21:02.720 --> 21:04.990
- Oh, that's weird. What's
wrong with my ears? - Nothing.

21:05.040 --> 21:08.470
- Oh, it's weird. Everything sounds wrong.
- It's a side effect.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.590
I can hear you. I can
hear you fine. It's like...

21:10.640 --> 21:12.430
I don't know, it's like, erm...

21:12.480 --> 21:14.430
It's like something's missing.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.790
Doctor, we have to tell
her. We always tell them.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.840
Tell me what? What's he
talking about? Doctor...?

21:25.600 --> 21:27.740
Doctor, what's going on?

21:28.520 --> 21:31.430
Clara, there's a sound you've been
living with every day of your life,

21:31.480 --> 21:33.950
but you've learned not to hear.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.540
What sound?

21:37.520 --> 21:39.150
What's wrong? Just tell me.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.870
Doctor, what sound?

21:40.920 --> 21:42.660
Your heartbeat.

21:45.520 --> 21:48.820
Your physical processes
have been time looped...

21:49.600 --> 21:52.600
Frozen between one heartbeat and the next.

21:54.760 --> 21:57.500
Even your breathing is just a habit.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.870
You don't need it.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.270
If I'm frozen, how can I...

22:06.400 --> 22:07.670
How can I be walking about?

22:07.720 --> 22:11.150
Because the Time Lords are
very clever. It doesn't matter.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.910
Yes, it matters to me!

22:12.960 --> 22:14.950
Doctor, we have to explain.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.390
Doctor, what is going on?

22:16.440 --> 22:18.670
Although you are currently
conscious and aware,

22:18.720 --> 22:21.510
in fact, you died billions of years ago.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.070
Doctor...?

22:23.120 --> 22:25.110
We have extracted you

22:25.160 --> 22:28.150
at the very end of your time
stream to request your help.

22:28.200 --> 22:32.390
Once we're finished here, you will
be returned to your final moments.

22:32.440 --> 22:36.070
Your death is an
established historical event

22:36.120 --> 22:38.030
and cannot be altered.

22:38.080 --> 22:40.590
- I'm sorry.
- Doctor, will you just talk to me!

22:40.640 --> 22:41.910
I'll try not to break your jaw.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.760
- My jaw?
- I wasn't talking to you.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.150
Doctor, you can't do
this. You know you can't.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.750
No, General, I don't know that.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.990
Everybody, stay exactly where you are!

22:55.040 --> 22:58.150
No moving about. On pain of
death, no-one take a selfie!

22:58.200 --> 23:00.110
These people are unarmed.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.750
So are you.

23:01.800 --> 23:04.310
Doctor, I will not let you leave here.

23:04.360 --> 23:08.430
That's the sidearm of the
President's personal security.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.750
There isn't a stun setting.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.590
I will not let Clara die.

23:13.640 --> 23:16.710
She's been dead for half the
lifetime of the universe.

23:16.760 --> 23:20.720
If you tried to change that,
you could fracture time itself.

23:21.920 --> 23:25.040
Doctor, Lord President, are you
really going to take that risk?

23:28.840 --> 23:30.240
Doctor...

23:33.480 --> 23:35.520
Please...

23:37.080 --> 23:38.950
I don't want this.

23:42.160 --> 23:43.830
Put it down, please.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.480
Regeneration?

23:47.880 --> 23:49.240
Tenth.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.670
Good luck.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.960
You too, sir.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
I want a neuro block.

23:57.560 --> 24:00.230
Human compatible. Quickly! Come on!

24:00.640 --> 24:02.380
Come on, quick!

24:03.440 --> 24:06.540
This Clara person, you
must really like her.

24:06.920 --> 24:08.860
Why do you say that?

24:09.040 --> 24:11.030
You killed a man.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.220
You don't seem the type.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.710
You killed that man!
You shot him! He's dead!

24:16.760 --> 24:18.710
- It was him or you.
- I don't care!

24:18.760 --> 24:19.750
Yeah?

24:19.800 --> 24:22.390
Well, the difference is,
when you die, you stay dead.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.830
So does he!

24:23.880 --> 24:27.030
We're on Gallifrey. Death
is Time Lord for man flu!

24:27.080 --> 24:30.030
Med team to sector 52,
extraction chamber seven.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.280
Regeneration in progress.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.660
Are you all right, sir?

24:42.160 --> 24:44.600
Oh... Er, sorry... ma'am.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.590
Urgh...

24:47.640 --> 24:50.040
Back to normal, am I?

24:51.080 --> 24:53.630
The only time I've been
a man, that last body.

24:53.680 --> 24:56.110
Dear Lord, how do you
cope with all that ego?

24:56.160 --> 24:57.830
Ma'am, where's the Doctor?

24:57.880 --> 24:59.030
The Cloisters.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.670
Where else would he run,

25:00.720 --> 25:03.070
except into the greatest
danger on Gallifrey.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.750
The hell of the Time Lords.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.950
I thought you said Gallifrey
was frozen in another dimension?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.670
- Well, they must have unfrozen
it and come back. - How?

25:11.720 --> 25:14.820
I didn't ask. It would
make them feel clever.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.280
- Happy?
- No.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.870
Tell me what a neural block is.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.870
Never mind.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.110
This way.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.150
What did you mean, human compatible?

25:29.200 --> 25:31.870
So what was it, the thing you took?

25:32.680 --> 25:35.680
There was only one way to keep Clara safe.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.310
I had to wipe some of her memory.

25:38.360 --> 25:39.760
Of what?

25:41.320 --> 25:43.080
Of me.

25:49.320 --> 25:53.030
The Cloister Wraiths.
Sliders, we used to call them.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.670
They guard the Matrix.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.750
- We're safe in here.
- Why?

25:56.800 --> 25:59.190
They only attack if you
make any attempt to leave.

25:59.240 --> 26:00.750
How long are we planning to stay?

26:00.800 --> 26:03.400
Or, actually, if you try to stay.

26:05.040 --> 26:08.540
You realise how well that
conversation went, right?

26:08.640 --> 26:11.440
You're starting to look, er, a bit...

26:20.520 --> 26:23.150
We need to block every
exit from the Cloisters.

26:23.200 --> 26:26.550
Every available man. I
need that place surrounded.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.710
No-one's ever made it
back out of the Cloisters.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.670
Not quite no-one.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.390
This way, I'm fairly sure.

26:32.440 --> 26:34.590
According to the stories,
there's a secret way out.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.710
If you find it, the Sliders let you go.

26:36.760 --> 26:41.120
Ex... term... in... ate!

26:42.080 --> 26:43.470
It's OK.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.460
It's OK, look at it.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.630
Exterminate...

26:48.680 --> 26:50.390
me!

26:50.440 --> 26:51.670
Is it trapped?

26:51.720 --> 26:54.390
Don't worry, it's been neutralised.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.270
Those aren't vines.

26:56.320 --> 27:00.000
In your terms, they're fibre-optic
cables, they're alive and growing.

27:01.080 --> 27:03.430
We're inside the biggest
database in history.

27:03.480 --> 27:07.380
- Sometimes, people are stupid
enough to break in. - And?

27:07.760 --> 27:10.150
It's a database. They get filed.

27:10.200 --> 27:15.840
Ex... term... in... ate...

27:17.360 --> 27:18.430
.. me!

27:18.480 --> 27:21.510
Probably a leftover
from the Cloister Wars.

27:21.560 --> 27:24.390
There's nothing we can do. Come on.

27:24.440 --> 27:26.790
Exterminate... me!

27:26.840 --> 27:30.240
Exterminate... me!

27:31.600 --> 27:32.950
Ex...

27:33.000 --> 27:34.510
.. term...

27:34.560 --> 27:36.150
.. in...

27:36.200 --> 27:37.600
.. ate...

27:39.640 --> 27:40.910
.. me!

28:00.320 --> 28:02.260
Keep away from them!

28:03.480 --> 28:05.270
The Matrix can use them as a defence.

28:05.320 --> 28:08.190
It means the secret exit must be close.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.630
- What's to defend in a crypt?
- It's not just a crypt.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.070
More like a stone circuit board.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.230
This is the Matrix database.

28:18.280 --> 28:21.080
Database? What do you mean, database?

28:23.280 --> 28:24.870
Oh...

28:24.920 --> 28:26.390
Oh?

28:26.440 --> 28:27.430
Oh...

28:27.480 --> 28:28.990
Oh?

28:29.040 --> 28:30.950
Oh...

28:31.000 --> 28:32.950
Looks like the primary service hatch.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.800
- Just have to work out the key. - Oh.

28:37.360 --> 28:38.470
When Time Lords die,

28:38.520 --> 28:41.550
their minds are uploaded to
a thing called the Matrix.

28:41.600 --> 28:44.110
This structure, it's
like a living computer.

28:44.160 --> 28:48.790
It can predict the future, generate
prophecies out of algorithms,

28:48.840 --> 28:52.920
ring the Cloister bells in the
event of impending catastrophe.

28:55.520 --> 28:58.710
The Sliders -- they're
just like the guard dogs,

28:58.760 --> 29:00.830
the firewall.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.070
Projections from inside the Matrix itself,

29:03.120 --> 29:06.000
the dead, manning the battlements.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.470
Was I supposed to understand any of that?

29:09.520 --> 29:12.510
The Time Lords have got a
big computer made of ghosts,

29:12.560 --> 29:14.470
in a crypt, guarded by more ghosts.

29:14.520 --> 29:15.990
Didn't hurt, did it?

29:16.040 --> 29:17.520
Tiny bit.

29:24.200 --> 29:27.510
Why would a computer need to protect
itself from the people who made it?

29:27.560 --> 29:30.590
All computers do that in the end.
You wait until the internet starts.

29:30.640 --> 29:33.120
Oh, that was a war!

29:35.280 --> 29:36.710
They don't seem to be moving.

29:36.760 --> 29:39.270
And they're by lift shaft seven.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.120
Keep monitoring.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.430
A long time ago, there was
a student at the Academy.

29:47.480 --> 29:50.480
He got in here, disappeared for four days.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.870
Showed up in a completely
different part of the city.

29:53.920 --> 29:57.310
Said the Sliders talked to him,

29:57.360 --> 29:59.630
they showed him the secret passage out.

29:59.680 --> 30:01.510
And we just need the code.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.550
What, and the kid told you the secret?

30:03.600 --> 30:05.870
Ah, no, he didn't tell anyone anything.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.670
He went completely mad, never right
in the head again. So they say.

30:08.720 --> 30:11.470
- OK, that's encouraging...
- The last I heard,

30:11.520 --> 30:14.680
he stole the moon and
the President's wife.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.990
Was she, erm...

30:19.040 --> 30:21.270
Was she nice, the President's wife?

30:21.320 --> 30:24.230
Ah, well, that was a lie
put about by the Shabogans.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.360
It was the President's daughter. I
didn't steal the moon, I lost it...

30:28.640 --> 30:30.710
I'd know you anywhere.

30:32.960 --> 30:35.550
I was a completely different
person in those days.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.790
Eccentric,

30:36.840 --> 30:38.070
a bit mad,

30:38.120 --> 30:39.630
rude to people.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.510
- Look at me again.
- Sorry, what?

30:41.560 --> 30:44.230
In the eye. Look at me. Just do it.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.430
What?

30:48.360 --> 30:49.900
What is it?

30:51.880 --> 30:54.390
How long has it been for
you since you last saw me?

30:54.440 --> 30:55.470
Oh...

30:55.520 --> 30:58.060
- Oh, I'm not sure.
- How long?

30:59.360 --> 31:01.910
I was stuck on a place.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.350
- They...
- They what?

31:03.400 --> 31:05.110
Who? Who are we talking about?

31:05.160 --> 31:08.160
They wanted something
from me. Information.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.600
It really doesn't matter.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.070
What happened to your coat?

31:18.120 --> 31:20.590
The velvety coat. I
liked that one, it was...

31:20.640 --> 31:22.150
- it was very Doctory.
- I changed it.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.350
Why?

31:23.400 --> 31:25.950
Well, I can't be the Doctor all the time.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.590
I think I've almost got
it. I think this is it.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.190
Tell me what they did to you.

31:30.240 --> 31:33.040
Tell me, what happened to the Doctor?

31:35.200 --> 31:36.550
We're here.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.470
It's pretty quiet.

31:38.960 --> 31:41.070
'He seems to be talking to her.

31:41.120 --> 31:43.070
'Like he's telling her a story.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.590
'You might want to have a look.'

31:44.640 --> 31:46.790
Open up, we're going in.

31:46.840 --> 31:49.710
We'll stick to the perimeter, no
more than three paces from the lift.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.750
Do not enter the Cloisters.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.990
20 feet of pure diamond.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.670
Harder than diamond.

31:56.720 --> 31:59.230
But you break through
anything, given time.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.510
How much time?

32:00.560 --> 32:01.910
- Miss Oswald...
- Stay back.

32:01.960 --> 32:06.200
- I'm sorry, but we have to find a way
to extract you... - I said, stay back!

32:13.560 --> 32:15.750
The Hybrid, what is it?

32:15.800 --> 32:17.910
What's so important you
would fight so long?

32:17.960 --> 32:19.630
It doesn't matter what the Hybrid is.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.950
It only matters that I
convinced them that I knew.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.310
Otherwise, I'd have had
nothing left to bargain with.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.960
- What were you bargaining for?
- What do you think?

32:28.800 --> 32:29.990
You.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.390
I had to find a way to save you.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.950
I knew it had to be the Time Lords.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.910
They cost you your life
on Trap Street, Clara,

32:35.960 --> 32:37.830
and I was going to make
them bring you back.

32:37.880 --> 32:40.390
I just had to hang on in there for a bit.

32:40.440 --> 32:41.870
How long?

32:41.920 --> 32:43.520
It was fine.

32:47.240 --> 32:48.350
One question.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.830
And you will answer.

32:49.880 --> 32:52.550
How long was the Doctor trapped
inside the confession dial?

32:52.600 --> 32:53.950
We think...

32:54.000 --> 32:56.680
four-and-a-half-billion years.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.590
He could have left any time he wanted.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.150
He just had to say what he knew.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.800
The dial would have released him.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.580
Four-and-a-half-billion years...

33:22.360 --> 33:24.100
If she says so.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.110
Why would you even do that?

33:29.840 --> 33:31.670
I was dead!

33:31.720 --> 33:33.070
I was dead and gone.

33:33.120 --> 33:36.220
Why? Why would you even
do that to yourself?

33:39.080 --> 33:41.080
I had a duty of care.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.980
Listen, I'm nearly through here.

33:47.840 --> 33:50.550
If I'm right, there should
be a service duct under here.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.830
We'll be able to get to the old workshops.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.390
They'll have TARDISes there.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.040
OK, listen...

33:57.400 --> 34:00.030
- I have something I need to say.
- We do not have time.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.680
No, my time.

34:03.560 --> 34:04.790
My time is up.

34:04.840 --> 34:08.600
Doctor, between one heartbeat and
the last is all the time I have.

34:11.560 --> 34:13.830
People like me and you,

34:13.880 --> 34:16.790
we should say things to one another.

34:16.840 --> 34:19.380
And I'm going to say them now...

34:40.840 --> 34:42.639
You're monsters.

34:43.520 --> 34:46.630
Here you are, hiding
away at the end of time.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.679
Do you even know why?

34:49.280 --> 34:51.350
Because you are hated.

34:52.440 --> 34:54.000
You are...

34:55.480 --> 34:58.160
.. hated by everybody.

34:59.240 --> 35:01.110
But by nobody more than me.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.830
What did you say to him?

35:02.880 --> 35:04.830
Oh, nothing I'm going to tell you,

35:04.880 --> 35:06.680
or anybody else.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.350
Except, maybe this one part.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.960
I said...

35:15.040 --> 35:17.310
"Don't worry, Doctor.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.830
"They'll all be looking at me!"

35:22.840 --> 35:25.230
You need to tell us what the
Doctor is going to do now.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.990
You really are thick, aren't you?

35:27.040 --> 35:29.990
The Doctor is back on Gallifrey.

35:30.040 --> 35:33.440
Took him four-and-half-billion
years to get here.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.910
What do you think he's going to do now?

35:37.920 --> 35:41.150
Why, he's stealing a
TARDIS and running away.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.960
Bye!

35:44.200 --> 35:45.270
You were quick.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.350
Time machine. I backed up a bit.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.870
'Doctor! Doctor, face me!'

35:49.920 --> 35:51.670
Doctor, can you hear me?

35:51.720 --> 35:55.200
- Get out of that TARDIS
and face me, boy! - Boy?

35:59.400 --> 36:01.150
You have gone too far.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.990
You have broken every
code you ever lived by.

36:04.040 --> 36:07.310
After all this time, after
everything I've done,

36:07.360 --> 36:10.070
- don't you think the universe
owes me this? - Owes you what?

36:10.120 --> 36:11.870
All you're doing is giving her hope.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.630
Since when is hope a bad thing?

36:13.680 --> 36:17.080
Hope is a terrible thing on the scaffold.

36:26.720 --> 36:28.150
Where can he run?

36:28.200 --> 36:30.110
Where he always runs.

36:30.160 --> 36:31.560
Away.

36:33.640 --> 36:35.160
Just away.

36:37.720 --> 36:39.630
- What do you think of
the new wheels? - Basic.

36:39.680 --> 36:43.120
- Classic! Look at the colour
scheme. - It's all white. - Genius!

36:44.920 --> 36:47.990
Check your heartbeat again.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.990
- I think that you'll
find you have one. - Yeah?

36:51.040 --> 36:54.040
It should have restarted when we
broke free of Gallifrey's time zone.

36:55.520 --> 36:56.990
You're alive!

36:57.040 --> 36:58.950
Now we just have to
shake off the Time Lords.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.710
There's only one place we can do that.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.870
What do you say to lunch,
followed by breakfast?

37:02.920 --> 37:05.190
Because we're time travellers
and that's how we roll.

37:05.240 --> 37:08.310
Then cocktails with Moses. Then I'm
going to invent a flying submarine.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.430
Why? Because no-one ever
has and it's annoying.

37:10.480 --> 37:13.430
And maybe we should use this
TARDIS to find my proper one.

37:13.480 --> 37:15.480
I need a clean shirt.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.790
Doctor...

37:18.840 --> 37:20.390
I still don't have a pulse.

37:20.440 --> 37:23.880
- You just haven't found it yet. Try again.
- I know how to take my pulse.

37:25.040 --> 37:27.310
Look, I know how to do it.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.040
See, no pulse, right?

37:35.760 --> 37:37.630
Is it still there?

37:38.160 --> 37:39.310
Don't lie to me.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.550
I think we maybe just have
to fly a little bit further,

37:41.600 --> 37:43.800
give it a bit more welly.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.350
They said, your lot,

37:49.400 --> 37:52.310
that if you saved me, time would
fracture. What does that mean?

37:52.360 --> 37:54.910
Oh, they're exaggerating.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.310
They exaggerate all the time.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.830
History will be fine.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.150
Time will heal. It always does.

38:02.200 --> 38:03.910
- Always?
- Yeah.

38:03.960 --> 38:06.670
It'll sort itself out. It'll be all right.

38:06.720 --> 38:10.620
You'll have a heartbeat. Or
don't you trust me any more?!

38:10.800 --> 38:13.200
No. Not when you're shouting.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.630
- Where are we going?
- Nowhere in space,

38:22.680 --> 38:24.480
forward in time.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.750
We're going to the last
hours of the universe.

38:29.800 --> 38:33.670
We're going long past where
the Time Lords were hiding.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.790
Literally, to the end.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.310
They won't be able to track us there.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.230
We'll just be there for a minute.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.240
I just need to...

38:44.520 --> 38:46.630
I need to make an adjustment.

38:46.680 --> 38:48.070
To what?

38:48.120 --> 38:50.790
It's nothing, really. It's this...

38:50.840 --> 38:51.990
A neural block.

38:52.040 --> 38:54.910
Human compatible. That's what you said.

38:58.840 --> 39:01.380
We don't have to stay here long.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.910
Check your heartbeat again.

39:03.960 --> 39:06.790
Your timeline must have started by now.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.510
A pulse, yeah?

39:09.720 --> 39:11.790
You have a pulse, yes?

39:12.320 --> 39:13.750
Pulse?

39:13.800 --> 39:16.030
- Let me do it.
- I am checking it properly!

39:16.080 --> 39:17.510
This should work.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.680
This has got to work.

39:20.840 --> 39:23.840
What if one last heartbeat
is all I've got?

39:24.680 --> 39:26.590
What if time isn't healing?

39:26.640 --> 39:28.230
What if the universe needs me to die?

39:28.280 --> 39:31.030
The universe is over! It
doesn't have a say any more!

39:31.080 --> 39:33.190
We're standing on the last ember,

39:33.240 --> 39:36.030
the last fragment of
everything that ever was.

39:36.080 --> 39:39.180
As of this moment, I
am answerable to no-one!

39:53.680 --> 39:56.150
How can there be anybody there?

39:56.760 --> 39:58.430
Four knocks...

39:59.760 --> 40:01.900
It's always four knocks.

40:02.640 --> 40:03.960
No.

40:05.360 --> 40:06.870
This one I do alone.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.910
What's out there?

40:08.960 --> 40:10.200
Me.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.470
I told you once...

40:30.880 --> 40:32.680
.. so long ago...

40:35.480 --> 40:38.920
that the universe would become a very
small place when I'm angry with you.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.840
Small enough for you yet?

40:45.800 --> 40:47.360
Hello, me.

40:48.360 --> 40:51.030
You don't seem surprised to see me.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.150
At the end of everything,

40:54.200 --> 40:58.110
we should expect the company
of immortals, so I've been told.

40:58.160 --> 41:00.430
Even the other immortals are gone.

41:00.480 --> 41:02.080
It's just me.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.230
The one and only me.

41:05.280 --> 41:06.910
Finally, you earn the title,

41:06.960 --> 41:09.950
sitting here in a reality bubble
at the end of time itself.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.470
How are you sustaining it, by the way?

41:12.520 --> 41:14.120
Brilliantly.

41:15.080 --> 41:17.680
I've been watching the stars die.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.280
It was beautiful.

41:23.640 --> 41:25.000
No.

41:26.120 --> 41:27.310
It was sad.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.640
No. It was both.

41:31.480 --> 41:35.180
But that's not something
you would understand, is it?

41:35.440 --> 41:37.580
You don't like endings.

41:38.960 --> 41:40.760
She died, Doctor.

41:41.960 --> 41:45.270
Clara died billions of years ago.

41:45.320 --> 41:46.750
- You killed her.
- No.

41:46.800 --> 41:48.510
- You let it happen.
- No, I didn't.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.070
Neither did you.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.710
She did.

41:51.760 --> 41:54.760
She died for who she
was and who she loved.

41:55.160 --> 41:57.390
She fell where she stood. It was sad.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.520
And it was beautiful.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.870
And it is over.

42:02.920 --> 42:05.750
- We have no right to change
who she was. - Ashildr...

42:05.800 --> 42:08.230
- Me.
- Me, go to hell.

42:08.280 --> 42:11.780
By my calculations, you've
got about five minutes.

42:12.040 --> 42:15.030
- You know why we run, Doctor?
- Because it's fun!

42:15.080 --> 42:17.950
Because we know summer can't last forever.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.680
Of course it can. Of course it can.

42:21.880 --> 42:23.670
You just have to steal a time machine.

42:23.720 --> 42:25.260
The Hybrid.

42:27.360 --> 42:31.360
Five minutes to hell. I think
it's time to tell the truth.

42:45.480 --> 42:46.750
Screen on.

42:46.800 --> 42:49.230
'You were barely more than a child.'

42:49.280 --> 42:51.230
You broke in here

42:51.280 --> 42:53.270
and the Wraiths spoke
to you about the Hybrid.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.950
Why did that story make you so scared?

42:55.000 --> 42:56.470
I don't know. I don't remember it.

42:56.520 --> 42:58.430
Sometimes you do.

42:58.480 --> 43:01.230
It's always the way with
things we'd rather forget.

43:01.280 --> 43:03.070
You remember now, though, don't you?

43:03.120 --> 43:05.950
Tell me, Doctor, who is... the Hybrid?

43:06.000 --> 43:08.110
Who threatens all of time and space?

43:08.160 --> 43:09.910
Oh, that's easy. That's very, very easy.

43:09.960 --> 43:11.560
The Hybrid...

43:12.640 --> 43:14.040
is you.

43:15.800 --> 43:18.830
'I'm human, with a little
bit of Mire inside me.'

43:18.880 --> 43:21.270
'The Hybrid is supposed to be
half Time Lord, half Dalek.'

43:21.320 --> 43:22.550
'No, it isn't.'

43:22.600 --> 43:25.670
The actual prophecy specifies
only two warrior races.

43:25.720 --> 43:28.230
The Daleks and the Time Lords
made assumptions, of course.

43:28.280 --> 43:29.510
And they would.

43:29.560 --> 43:32.040
Humans and the Mire...

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
.. both warrior races. It fits perfectly.

43:36.520 --> 43:38.430
It's an interesting theory.

43:38.480 --> 43:40.680
Do you have a better one?

43:41.480 --> 43:43.390
By your own reasoning,

43:43.440 --> 43:47.480
why couldn't the Hybrid be
half Time Lord, half human?

43:50.120 --> 43:52.150
Tell me, Doctor, I've always wondered...

43:52.200 --> 43:54.030
You're a Time Lord,

43:54.080 --> 43:56.550
you're a high-born Gallifreyan.

43:57.400 --> 44:00.400
Why is it you spend so much time on Earth?

44:02.520 --> 44:04.630
That's your best theory? I'm the Hybrid?

44:04.680 --> 44:07.310
I ran away from Gallifrey
because I was afraid of myself?

44:07.360 --> 44:09.310
That doesn't make any sense.

44:09.360 --> 44:12.300
It makes perfect sense, and you know it.

44:13.040 --> 44:15.030
Am I right?

44:15.080 --> 44:16.990
Is it true?

44:17.040 --> 44:18.780
Does it matter?

44:21.160 --> 44:22.440
No.

44:24.120 --> 44:27.030
Because I have a better theory.

44:27.080 --> 44:28.510
Really?

44:28.560 --> 44:32.480
What if the Hybrid wasn't
one person, but two?

44:35.640 --> 44:38.430
- Two?
- A dangerous combination

44:38.480 --> 44:41.310
of a passionate and powerful Time Lord

44:41.360 --> 44:44.190
and a young woman so very similar to him.

44:44.240 --> 44:47.710
'Companions who are willing to
push each other to extremes.'

44:47.760 --> 44:51.070
She's my friend. She's just my friend.

44:51.120 --> 44:53.110
How did you meet her?

44:53.160 --> 44:54.600
Missy...!

44:55.670 --> 44:56.670
Missy.

44:56.720 --> 44:58.790
Missy.

44:58.840 --> 45:00.380
The Master.

45:01.480 --> 45:03.520
The lover of chaos.

45:04.600 --> 45:05.990
Who wants you to love it, too.

45:06.040 --> 45:08.310
She's quite the matchmaker.

45:09.080 --> 45:10.310
Clara's my friend.

45:10.360 --> 45:11.760
I know.

45:12.880 --> 45:15.230
And you're willing to
risk all of time and space

45:15.280 --> 45:17.280
because you miss her.

45:18.240 --> 45:21.870
- One wonders what the pair of you
will get up to next. - Nothing.

45:21.920 --> 45:23.550
Nothing at all.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.710
I know I went too far.

45:25.760 --> 45:27.310
I get it.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.710
That's why I'm doing what I'm doing.

45:29.760 --> 45:32.230
- And what would that be?
- I'm taking her back to Earth.

45:32.280 --> 45:34.870
Somewhere safe, somewhere out of the way.

45:34.920 --> 45:38.820
I'm going to wipe her memory
of every last detail of me.

45:39.280 --> 45:41.270
'It'll be like our
friendship never happened.'

45:41.320 --> 45:43.920
'That may not be what she wants.'

45:44.080 --> 45:45.830
'I've done it before.

45:45.880 --> 45:47.910
'Usually, I do it telepathically,

45:47.960 --> 45:50.960
'But this time, I've
got something better.'

45:51.840 --> 45:53.790
It's quite...

45:53.840 --> 45:55.350
painless.

45:55.400 --> 45:58.070
Will you tell her what you're going to do?

45:58.120 --> 45:59.110
Of course.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.630
When?

46:00.680 --> 46:01.880
Now.

46:06.680 --> 46:08.220
Screen off.

46:22.360 --> 46:24.230
- You OK?
- Yeah.

46:25.080 --> 46:27.910
Yeah, yeah. Just, you know, my pulse.

46:27.960 --> 46:29.790
Yeah, we'll fix that somehow. I promise.

46:29.840 --> 46:33.320
- You remember Ashildr, of course.
- Yeah, sure.

46:34.600 --> 46:37.700
I thought you'd be more
surprised to see her.

46:39.240 --> 46:40.980
I was watching.

46:41.960 --> 46:43.700
On the monitor.

46:45.280 --> 46:46.870
No.

46:46.920 --> 46:49.510
Doctor, whatever you're
about to do, don't do it!

46:49.560 --> 46:52.590
It won't hurt, it'll be nothing.
You'll just pass out for a moment.

46:52.640 --> 46:54.590
- And then?
- When you wake, you'll be fine.

46:54.640 --> 46:56.510
- But...
- Clara, just listen to me.

46:56.560 --> 46:58.270
Just say it. Say it.

46:58.320 --> 46:59.910
Come on. Tell me.

46:59.960 --> 47:01.990
When you wake up, you
will have forgotten me.

47:02.040 --> 47:04.910
- You'll have forgotten we ever even met.
- And why would I want that?

47:04.960 --> 47:06.150
Because it's the only way.

47:06.200 --> 47:08.190
That stuff in your head, the image of me,

47:08.240 --> 47:10.150
they could use it to find you.

47:10.200 --> 47:12.230
I, er... I used these.

47:12.280 --> 47:13.470
- On what?
- That.

47:13.520 --> 47:15.510
- What did you do?
- What do you think?

47:15.560 --> 47:17.510
Ashildr's right, you see? We're too alike.

47:17.560 --> 47:18.870
- Tell me what you did.
- What else?

47:18.920 --> 47:21.150
What else do you think I
did? I reversed the polarity.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.590
Push that button, Doctor, it
will go off in your own face.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.910
- You were trying to trick me?
- What were you doing to me?

47:25.960 --> 47:28.760
- I'm trying to keep you safe.
- Why?

47:29.280 --> 47:31.030
Nobody's ever safe.

47:31.080 --> 47:33.820
I've never asked you for that, ever.

47:34.080 --> 47:35.830
These have been the best years of my life.

47:35.880 --> 47:37.750
And they are mine.

47:39.160 --> 47:42.670
Tomorrow is promised to no-one,
Doctor, but I insist upon my past.

47:42.720 --> 47:44.790
I am entitled to that.

47:46.440 --> 47:48.320
It's mine.

47:57.680 --> 47:59.760
Oh, Clara Oswald...

48:03.680 --> 48:05.480
What am I doing?

48:10.760 --> 48:12.400
You're right.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.270
You're always...

48:16.320 --> 48:17.920
always right.

48:20.520 --> 48:22.460
So what happens now?

48:23.240 --> 48:24.310
Hey?

48:24.360 --> 48:26.750
Me and you, what do we do now?

48:26.800 --> 48:29.030
I'm not sure you managed
to reverse the polarity.

48:29.080 --> 48:31.550
I'm not even sure that you can.

48:33.400 --> 48:34.950
It'll do something...

48:35.000 --> 48:36.510
to one of us.

48:36.560 --> 48:38.900
Better than flipping a coin.

48:40.280 --> 48:41.880
Doctor...?

48:44.000 --> 48:46.140
You and me... together.

48:48.680 --> 48:50.830
Look how far I went,

48:50.880 --> 48:53.020
for fear of losing you.

48:55.320 --> 48:57.150
This has to stop.

48:57.200 --> 48:59.140
One of us has to go.

49:13.400 --> 49:15.270
You really don't know which?

49:15.320 --> 49:17.060
Let's find out.

49:17.840 --> 49:22.000
Let's do it like we've
done everything else.

49:23.200 --> 49:24.720
Together.

49:28.200 --> 49:30.150
How about we just don't?

49:30.200 --> 49:32.990
Why don't we just... fly away somewhere?

49:33.040 --> 49:35.640
Oh, that'd be great, wouldn't it?

49:39.120 --> 49:40.640
God, yeah.

49:44.600 --> 49:46.400
Good luck, Clara.

49:47.320 --> 49:49.190
Good luck, Doctor.

49:54.760 --> 49:56.760
So, what happens now?

49:59.880 --> 50:02.910
I suppose, we just, erm... We
just wait a minute, I suppose.

50:02.960 --> 50:05.080
And one of us...

50:10.560 --> 50:12.680
One of us will...

50:14.360 --> 50:17.480
I don't think I could ever forget you.

50:20.080 --> 50:23.580
Clara, I don't think you're
ever going to have to.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.280
No...

50:33.360 --> 50:34.550
Run like hell!

50:34.600 --> 50:36.190
What?

50:36.240 --> 50:38.110
Run like hell, because you always need to.

50:38.160 --> 50:40.510
Laugh at everything,
because it's always funny.

50:40.560 --> 50:42.350
No. Stop it. You're saying goodbye.

50:42.400 --> 50:46.350
- Don't say goodbye!
- Never be cruel and never be cowardly.

50:46.400 --> 50:49.600
And if you ever are, always make amends.

50:51.040 --> 50:52.310
Stop it!

50:52.360 --> 50:53.510
Stop! Stop it!

50:53.560 --> 50:55.430
Never eat pears.

50:55.480 --> 50:57.790
They're too squishy and they
always make your chin wet.

50:57.840 --> 50:59.750
That one's quite important. Write it down.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.550
I didn't mean to do this. I'm sorry.

51:01.600 --> 51:03.000
It's OK.

51:04.520 --> 51:05.920
It's OK.

51:06.960 --> 51:08.750
I went too far.

51:08.800 --> 51:10.790
I broke all my own rules.

51:10.840 --> 51:13.030
I became the Hybrid.

51:13.080 --> 51:15.240
This is right.

51:16.840 --> 51:18.440
I accept it.

51:19.520 --> 51:21.120
I can't.

51:23.920 --> 51:26.590
There has to be something I can do.

51:27.440 --> 51:29.040
Smile for me.

51:29.840 --> 51:31.070
Go on.

51:31.120 --> 51:33.150
Clara Oswald...

51:33.200 --> 51:35.040
one last time.

51:37.800 --> 51:39.670
How could I smile?

51:43.320 --> 51:44.720
It's OK.

51:45.480 --> 51:47.280
Don't you worry.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.800
I'll remember it.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.480
Sir?

52:10.920 --> 52:12.790
Are you all right?

52:14.120 --> 52:15.660
Where am I?

52:19.960 --> 52:21.910
How did I get here?

52:21.960 --> 52:23.630
Clara asked me to look after you.

52:23.680 --> 52:26.430
She said you might be a bit... upset.

52:26.480 --> 52:28.750
- Clara?
- Yeah.

52:28.800 --> 52:30.670
She was just here.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.780
I don't know where she went.

52:34.720 --> 52:36.040
Clara?

52:37.160 --> 52:38.760
Clara who?

52:40.400 --> 52:43.310
When something goes missing,
you can always recreate it

52:43.360 --> 52:45.300
by the hole it left.

52:45.960 --> 52:48.070
I know her name was Clara.

52:48.120 --> 52:50.520
I know we travelled together.

52:50.880 --> 52:53.110
I know that there was an
Ice Warrior on a submarine

52:53.160 --> 52:54.910
and a mummy on the Orient Express.

52:54.960 --> 52:57.510
I know we sat together in the Cloisters

52:57.560 --> 52:59.790
and she told me something very important,

52:59.840 --> 53:02.440
but I have no idea what she said.

53:03.800 --> 53:05.940
Or what she looked like.

53:06.480 --> 53:08.590
Or how she talked.

53:08.640 --> 53:10.180
Or laughed.

53:13.280 --> 53:14.710
There's nothing there.

53:14.760 --> 53:16.360
Just nothing.

53:20.080 --> 53:22.220
Are you looking for her?

53:24.080 --> 53:25.620
I'm trying.

53:26.440 --> 53:28.030
She could be anyone, right?

53:28.080 --> 53:30.350
You don't know who you're looking for.

53:30.400 --> 53:33.830
I mean, she could be me, for all you know.

53:33.880 --> 53:37.150
There's one thing I know
about her. Just one thing.

53:37.200 --> 53:40.300
If I met her again, I
would absolutely know.

53:42.200 --> 53:45.400
I think that we were here, you know?

53:46.640 --> 53:49.590
I think that we were here together once.

53:49.640 --> 53:51.780
I'm sure I'll remember.

53:52.560 --> 53:54.080
Over here.

53:56.440 --> 53:59.070
Stupid Doctor... Amy and Rory.

53:59.120 --> 54:01.060
It was Amy and Rory!

54:02.480 --> 54:05.710
What about your TARDIS,
hey? Have you found that yet?

54:05.760 --> 54:07.110
No.

54:07.160 --> 54:10.460
Somebody's moved it from
London. Still looking.

54:11.840 --> 54:13.640
But this diner...

54:14.760 --> 54:17.270
.. it wasn't always here, was it?

54:17.320 --> 54:19.030
It used to be on the
other side of the hill.

54:19.080 --> 54:22.580
Well, maybe someone will
find your TARDIS for you.

54:38.800 --> 54:41.670
What Clara told you in the Cloisters...

54:43.400 --> 54:45.230
I don't remember a single thing about it.

54:45.280 --> 54:46.510
You said memories...

54:46.560 --> 54:48.470
become stories

54:48.520 --> 54:50.460
when we forget them.

54:52.840 --> 54:55.380
Maybe some of them become songs.

54:57.880 --> 54:59.960
That would be nice.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.470
Yeah, it would be, wouldn't it?

55:51.240 --> 55:54.070
I don't think I've got the
Chameleon circuit working.

55:54.120 --> 55:57.590
- The outer shell might be stuck
as an American Diner. - Awesome.

55:57.640 --> 55:59.720
Still no pulse?

56:02.280 --> 56:03.990
Time isn't healing.

56:04.040 --> 56:05.870
I am still frozen.

56:05.920 --> 56:07.150
You know what that means?

56:07.200 --> 56:09.310
It means my death is a fixed event.

56:09.360 --> 56:11.550
The universe depends on it happening.

56:11.600 --> 56:13.070
I'm sorry.

56:13.120 --> 56:14.470
Why?

56:14.520 --> 56:17.070
Why does everybody think I am so scared?

56:17.120 --> 56:20.310
We all face the raven in
the end. That is the deal.

56:20.360 --> 56:22.910
If I go back to Gallifrey,
they can put me back, right?

56:22.960 --> 56:26.080
- On Trap Street, the moment
they took me out? - Of course.

56:27.960 --> 56:29.500
Mind you...

56:30.280 --> 56:31.950
.. seeing as I'm not actually ageing,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.270
there's a tiny little bit
of wiggle room, isn't there?

56:34.320 --> 56:36.350
- Wiggle room?
- Wiggle room.

56:36.400 --> 56:39.230
Yeah, you know, wiggle room.

56:39.280 --> 56:42.680
We could, erm, you know,
stop off on the way.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.750
- Where are we going?
- Gallifrey.

56:45.800 --> 56:47.640
Like I said...

56:49.080 --> 56:50.680
.. Gallifrey.

56:53.280 --> 56:55.220
The long way round.

59:52.400 --> 59:54.790
Is there anything on my head?

59:54.840 --> 59:56.510
Er, well, yes.

59:57.120 --> 59:58.230
Raver!

59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.080
Death initiating.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.390
Stop holding my hand!
People don't do that to me.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.950
Destroy them!

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.630
Nobody move or the head gets it.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.720
A sonic trowel... You realise
how ridiculous that sounds?

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.470
- You planned to take my head.
- It never crossed my mind.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.830
Long live the king!

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:20.190
This is a serious mission. There
is nothing to laugh about here.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.110
We're being threatened by a bag!

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.560
Give us the treasure!
