00:09.840 --> 00:12.560
-[Lisa]<i> Yes. Come and dance with me.</i>
<i>-I'm fucking hot.</i>

00:12.640 --> 00:13.680
<i>-Come on.</i>
<i>-I'm too hot.</i>

00:13.760 --> 00:15.640
<i>-Before you're too pissed to stand.</i>
<i>-Fuck's sake.</i>

00:15.720 --> 00:16.840
<i>Please! Come on.</i>

00:17.880 --> 00:19.120
<i>We can tango.</i>

00:19.840 --> 00:22.560
<i>-Oh, God! Come on!</i>
<i>-</i>[Lisa laughs]

00:22.640 --> 00:23.760
[Lisa] <i>Yeah!</i>

00:28.560 --> 00:29.960
[yells delightedly]

00:30.040 --> 00:31.600
[guests cheering]

00:31.680 --> 00:32.680
[Lisa] <i>Yes!</i>

00:32.960 --> 00:34.760
[Lisa shrieks, giggles]

00:36.880 --> 00:39.200
<i>He didn't drop me!</i>

00:41.400 --> 00:42.960
[Lisa] <i>Cheers!</i>

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
[Brandy whimpers]

00:46.560 --> 00:47.520
Come on, then.

00:51.960 --> 00:52.960
Yeah.

00:54.880 --> 00:55.840
Oh...

00:56.760 --> 00:57.600
Here.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.680
Yeah.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.400
Whose is that?

01:04.040 --> 01:05.600
Brandy's breakfast, innit?

01:09.560 --> 01:10.600
Come on.

01:11.560 --> 01:12.560
Come here.

01:15.600 --> 01:16.600
Good girl.

01:18.080 --> 01:21.040
Another day. Gotta keep it together.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.640
Face the world.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.640
[doorbell rings]

01:29.960 --> 01:31.960
Just to let you know,
I got the flat share.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.840
Oh... Good.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.520
-So, the bath did the trick, didn't it?
-Who'd have thought it?

01:36.600 --> 01:38.600
Maybe wash again someday.
Sky's the limit.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.240
My life's finally on the up.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.120
It's given me a new sense of confidence
if I'm honest.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.400
Not much, but... it helps.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.520
Oh, yeah. Who's that bird
I saw you with the other day?

01:48.600 --> 01:50.160
Coming out of 'ere. Lovely sort.

01:50.680 --> 01:52.760
-What bird?
-Blond. Really tasty.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.280
Not yours, is she?

01:54.960 --> 01:56.400
Oh. No.

01:56.800 --> 01:57.760
Roxy.

01:57.840 --> 01:59.320
Do you mind if I have a punt?

01:59.760 --> 02:01.880
Don't get as much action
as you might think.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.400
-I'll put in a word.
-Well, don't big me up too much,

02:05.480 --> 02:09.200
she'll be pretty disappointed as it is.
You know, if anything, downplay it.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.320
-Downplay you?
-Yeah.

02:11.760 --> 02:12.800
How would that go?

02:13.720 --> 02:15.040
Dunno. What d'you think?

02:16.040 --> 02:17.280
I'd have to say,

02:17.360 --> 02:20.120
"He looks like summat
police would drag out of a river."

02:21.480 --> 02:23.440
Yeah, but not the posh bit of a river.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.800
You know, something near a sewage works
or something.

02:28.080 --> 02:28.960
Any mail?

02:29.360 --> 02:30.400
No, don't think so.

02:31.840 --> 02:33.560
Good. Cheers.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.400
Ta-ra. See ya, mate.

02:58.280 --> 03:01.200
Sorry about the...
thing with the meditation.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.720
-He knows it wasn't your fault.
-Yeah.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.200
It was his. For being an annoying prick.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.120
Listen, Tony,
had you been drinking before that?

03:10.200 --> 03:12.920
No. I had to have a little one after
to calm down.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
<i>-</i>But--
-Right.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.200
-And that was his fault too, I imagine?
-No.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.120
Not just his.
Most things are a good excuse for a drink.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.960
I've always got drunk,
but I used to drink when I was happy,

03:22.040 --> 03:23.600
and... that was all right,

03:23.680 --> 03:26.680
but now I drink when I'm sad,
and that's not so good 'cause it...

03:27.320 --> 03:29.160
happens more often
and a little bit earlier.

03:29.680 --> 03:30.880
Just stop, then.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.400
-Brilliant!
-Come on, it's serious.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.600
If you've got a problem,
you should go to AA, or rehab, or--

03:37.680 --> 03:38.520
[Tony] Why?

03:39.280 --> 03:40.280
To get better.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.880
Drinking isn't my illness, is it?

03:42.960 --> 03:45.360
-Well, no, but it's bad for you.
-Everything's bad for you.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.480
We're all dying.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.280
Being healthy is just dying more slowly,
so--

03:49.360 --> 03:51.280
OK, so... you'll live longer.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.560
Yeah, but why?

03:52.640 --> 03:55.480
What do you mean, "Why?" So you can do
more of the things that you enjoy.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.200
I enjoy a drink.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.160
-Right.
-All drunks hurt themselves.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.960
Just the trick is to be a good drunk
and not hurt other people, but--

04:03.040 --> 04:05.560
But that, though, Tony,
you calling yourself a drunk...

04:05.640 --> 04:09.480
Only half the time. But, you know,
whatever... you want to label it,

04:10.000 --> 04:11.320
I drink in times of trouble.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.400
It's not my fault
the world's full of trouble, is it?

04:13.480 --> 04:15.360
It's... it's an 'orrible place.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.000
Everyone's screwed up in some way.
This is mine.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.880
Everyone's got worries, like...

04:19.960 --> 04:23.640
I dunno, money, or health, or famine, war.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.640
We're chimps
with brains the size of planets.

04:26.720 --> 04:30.280
No wonder we fucking get drunk
and try and kill each other. It's mental.

04:31.720 --> 04:32.840
Always good to talk.

04:34.520 --> 04:35.680
-Hiya.
-[Matt] Hey.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.160
-[Tony] All right?
-Having a chat?

04:37.240 --> 04:38.560
-[Tony] Yeah.
-Yeah.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.320
[Tony] I was just explaining
my new plan is to drink myself to death

04:42.440 --> 04:46.280
until I eventually implode in
on my own evolution.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.200
Do you believe in all that?

04:49.440 --> 04:52.240
Wh... what, the proven fact
that is evolution? Yeah.

04:52.320 --> 04:55.920
That's just the problem, isn't it?
Your science only deals with facts.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.920
-I'm a more open-minded type.
-[Tony] Good.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.120
-Love anything paranormal.
-[Tony] Do ya?

05:01.200 --> 05:02.880
Mm. Past lives. Telepathy.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.160
Got a little bit of that myself, actually.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.440
-Have ya?
-Mm.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.120
Do you know how you know
when an angel's entered the room?

05:09.680 --> 05:10.560
-So--
-Sorry,

05:10.640 --> 05:12.720
are you going to carry on talking to me?

05:13.960 --> 05:15.400
A sort of cinnamony smell.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.800
[exaggerated groaning, retching]

05:18.960 --> 05:21.360
-Childish.
-[Tony] Hold on.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.680
Has an angel just entered the room?

05:23.760 --> 05:25.240
Oh, no, you're eating a bun.

05:26.800 --> 05:27.960
[Sandra chuckles]

05:41.640 --> 05:42.640
So...

05:43.320 --> 05:44.400
me being zen

05:44.480 --> 05:46.000
didn't completely work out.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.000
-No?
-No.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.880
I went along
to the meditation thing, um...

05:51.440 --> 05:53.120
but the guy was so annoying!

05:53.200 --> 05:56.120
I ended up shouting at him
and storming out. [chuckles]

05:56.720 --> 05:58.840
-How was he annoying?
-In every way.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.080
Just slurping and sniffing.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.960
-Oh, and doing that thing.
-What?

06:03.040 --> 06:04.200
-[snorts]
-Oh!

06:04.280 --> 06:05.680
-Exactly!
-Ah...

06:08.200 --> 06:09.360
What did you shout?

06:09.440 --> 06:11.760
I think I called him
"a snot-curdling cunt."

06:12.440 --> 06:13.840
-[chuckling]
-Yeah.

06:15.680 --> 06:16.760
Oh, dear.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.240
I went home, got drunk,

06:18.320 --> 06:20.600
and watched videos of Lisa.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.560
Do you know the fable
of the frog and the scorpion?

06:27.640 --> 06:28.480
No.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.200
Well, this scorpion wants
to get across the river.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.800
So he asks the frog
if he'll give him a lift

06:35.880 --> 06:38.480
on his back,
and the frog says, "No. You'd sting me."

06:39.160 --> 06:42.160
And the scorpion says, "Why would
I do that? Then we'd both drown."

06:43.760 --> 06:47.000
And so the frog said,
"Oh, yes, that's true. OK."

06:47.080 --> 06:51.000
So halfway across the river,
the scorpion stings the frog.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.440
And the frog says,

06:54.320 --> 06:57.040
"Now we're both going to die.
Why did you sting me?"

06:57.440 --> 06:58.840
And the scorpion says,

06:59.760 --> 07:01.160
"Because I'm a scorpion."

07:01.920 --> 07:02.840
Mm-hmm.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.640
Yeah...

07:07.600 --> 07:09.760
Yeah, I guess I can't change my nature.

07:09.840 --> 07:10.920
No, you're the frog.

07:11.720 --> 07:12.840
-The frog?
-Yes.

07:12.920 --> 07:13.920
Really? Why?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.520
Well, you knew you wouldn't enjoy
that meditation thing

07:16.600 --> 07:18.560
but you went anyway
to please someone else.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.520
And then you got angry,

07:20.600 --> 07:22.480
and you even feel bad about that.

07:23.640 --> 07:24.800
You're the frog.

07:25.440 --> 07:26.360
Right.

07:26.440 --> 07:27.600
Sensitive.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.040
And trusting.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.600
Nothing to do with the shape?

07:30.680 --> 07:32.880
-[Anne chuckles lightly]
-Or the throat?

07:34.560 --> 07:36.080
Oh... the frog?

07:36.160 --> 07:37.440
[Anne chuckles]

07:38.040 --> 07:40.360
-I was hoping I was the scorpion.
-Yeah, I thought you would.

07:40.440 --> 07:41.440
-Know what I mean?
-Yes.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.440
Only 'cause it's cooler. I love frogs.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.920
But what I mean is
no one ever says, "Oh, I'd like a man.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.320
I'd like him to be
sort of podgy and sticky."

07:50.880 --> 07:51.880
-Fair.
-[Anne laughs]

07:51.960 --> 07:54.560
"I'd like him to be able
to hang onto a leaf."

07:54.640 --> 07:57.400
-[both laugh]
-"I'd like my man to be able

07:57.480 --> 08:00.160
to shove a worm into his mouth
with his front feet."

08:01.320 --> 08:05.760
Everyone? Yeah, this is June's son, James.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.920
-Your son now, innit?
-No, he's not.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Um, he's starting work experience today.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.960
-[James] Hi, everyone.
-Hey.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.680
Be good. Do what you're told.
Come here. Don't be too annoying.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.640
[June] Look at this.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.560
-Give us a kiss.
-Bloody hell, Mum!

08:20.080 --> 08:21.560
-Right, see you later.
-See you later.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.520
-Come on, you.
-OK. Bye.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.720
[June sighs]

08:25.160 --> 08:27.920
Probably get on your nerves.
Got a good heart, though.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.240
-OK.
-Well, not literally.

08:29.320 --> 08:32.160
He's obese,
so all his insides are pretty bad.

08:32.760 --> 08:36.200
Tragedy waiting to happen.
Well, he's got a terrible diet.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.480
He's not had a poo for a week.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.440
It's typical, that, though.

08:40.840 --> 08:43.200
When he does go,
you can hear him all over the house,

08:43.280 --> 08:44.560
in agony, screaming.

08:44.960 --> 08:48.200
I say, "It's your own fault,
eat some bloody fruit!" But he won't.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.080
I think that's how he'll die.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.280
On the loo.
You know, like, straining, heart attack,

08:54.360 --> 08:55.560
stroke, or something.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.680
Like Elvis.

08:58.520 --> 09:02.120
But without all the exciting stuff
Elvis did beforehand, you know?

09:03.400 --> 09:04.360
Mm-hmm.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.400
See you later.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.800
[Lenny] All right. You probably should
start reading the paper.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.600
-Why?
-Well, you're working here.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.120
-I guess.
-James?

09:13.680 --> 09:15.800
-Hi. Matt Braden, I'm the editor.
-Hi.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.960
-Hi, Matt. Nice to meet you.
-You too.

09:18.040 --> 09:21.240
This lot'll show you how it all works,
but if you've got any questions, just--

09:21.320 --> 09:23.320
-Yeah, are we covering the am-dram?
-The...?

09:23.760 --> 09:26.520
-What's that?
-I'm part of an amateur dramatics society,

09:26.600 --> 09:28.160
we rehearse at the community hall.

09:28.560 --> 09:31.440
It's brilliant, you know.
We do acting classes, dance.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.600
You dance, do you?

09:32.680 --> 09:34.160
Yeah, big time.

09:34.640 --> 09:35.840
Dance, sing,

09:35.920 --> 09:38.720
act, juggle...
I'm an all-round package, you know?

09:38.800 --> 09:39.800
Mm.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.880
Why don't you go and make some teas
for everyone?

09:41.960 --> 09:44.760
-It's a good place to start, innit?
-OK. Um...

09:45.520 --> 09:47.880
-Who wants tea?
-Nah.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.240
I'm all right, thank you.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.680
-No one wants tea.
-I'll have a tea.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.280
-Oh, OK.
-Over there.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.360
[James] Sure.

09:54.560 --> 09:55.760
[Lenny sighs]

09:57.680 --> 10:00.320
-You seem happy having a family.
-Yeah.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.000
It's about time I settled down.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.680
With one woman! [chuckles]

10:03.760 --> 10:05.280
Was you a bit of a ladies' man?

10:05.360 --> 10:07.240
[Lenny] Big time, yeah. Oh, yeah.

10:07.320 --> 10:08.560
-Right.
-[Lenny] Yeah.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.080
See, I was a late starter,
so I had a lot of catching up to do.

10:11.160 --> 10:13.920
You know, I didn't really start
playing the field till my 20s.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.400
Oh. OK.

10:16.080 --> 10:20.160
Yeah, I was quite shy in my teens.
I wasn't always this cool, I guess.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.240
-No?
-No. I...

10:22.800 --> 10:25.440
-I used to be sort of odd-looking.
-[Tony] Fuck me!

10:25.520 --> 10:27.600
-What did you used to look like?
-[Lenny] I dunno,

10:27.680 --> 10:29.920
but I remember <i>The Ugly Duckling</i>
being quite inspirational.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.600
Is that the one
where there's a weird little duckling

10:32.680 --> 10:35.240
and all the other ducks
are taking the piss out of it,

10:35.320 --> 10:38.760
but then when it grows up, it's not a duck
at all, it's, like, a big...

10:38.840 --> 10:41.680
200-pound sort of human slug

10:41.760 --> 10:43.760
that works in a local free newspaper?

10:43.840 --> 10:45.840
-Yeah, that's the one.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

10:47.320 --> 10:49.680
Play the field... Fuckin' hell!

10:50.960 --> 10:53.920
Um... I'd like to cover the am-dram,
if that's all right?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.480
-Yeah. We should all go and have a look.
-[James] Ooh...

10:56.560 --> 10:58.200
-bis-quits!
-[Tony] Definitely.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.080
Bloody hell, I'm knackered.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.040
-[Brian] All right?
-[Tony] All right.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.280
Whoa, who's this?

11:03.680 --> 11:04.920
Hi, I'm James.

11:05.480 --> 11:08.480
-You should help Brian with the papers.
-That's not really my thing.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.280
Well, you're meant to do
a bit of everything.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.120
-Bloody hell, all right, Dad!
-No, I'm not.

11:12.200 --> 11:15.520
Hey! Come on. I could do with a hand.
My back's killing me.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.680
All right,
but I've got to be at rehearsals by five.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.800
-[Brian] Rehearsals for what?
-My am-dram group.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.360
Can I join?

11:23.440 --> 11:26.200
Yeah.
Anyone can join if they have the talent.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.360
Bingo!

11:28.440 --> 11:29.280
-[James] Oh.
-Ha.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.680
-What do you do?
-[Brian] What don't I do?

11:32.400 --> 11:33.480
I'm a puppeteer.

11:33.880 --> 11:36.120
-[James] Oh.
-I... I write jokes.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.200
[giggles]

11:38.360 --> 11:39.360
Check this out...

11:44.200 --> 11:45.200
All right, Valerie?

11:46.120 --> 11:47.000
Yep.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.400
What's gray and comes in pints?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.680
-Dunno.
-Elephant.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.120
[Brian laughs wheezily]

11:53.200 --> 11:56.200
[makes air hissing, splattering sound]
You're soaked!

11:56.280 --> 11:58.320
-You're disgusting!
-[Brian] Oh, really?

11:58.640 --> 12:00.800
I'm not the one
with a face full of jizz, love!

12:14.080 --> 12:16.240
Right, afternoon, Tambury Players.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.000
-Afternoon, Ken.
-[Ken] Everybody!

12:18.080 --> 12:20.520
-[all] Afternoon, Ken.
-[Ken] Hello. How are we all doing?

12:20.600 --> 12:21.800
-We all good?
-[June] Not bad.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.720
Right, Brian,
welcome to the Tambury Players.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.280
-Hi, Brian.
-Hi, Brian.

12:26.360 --> 12:27.360
Let's do a name game.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.720
It's what we like to do,
don't we, when we get a new Player?

12:29.800 --> 12:32.760
So, name, age,
and something that you don't like,

12:32.840 --> 12:35.760
something that gets your goat,
something that winds you up.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.680
-Uh... My name's Brian, and I'm 45.
-[Ken] Mm.

12:39.760 --> 12:43.280
-Oh.
-And I really don't like my ex-wife.

12:43.960 --> 12:44.880
-Oh, dear.
-At all.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.160
Right. Why's that?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.200
-Slut.
-[Ken] OK.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.920
[Ken] Right, come on. Best faces on.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.440
-Oh, hello. Are you from <i>The Gazette?</i>
-[Tony] Yep.

12:54.520 --> 12:58.160
Ah! I run the society, Tambury Players.
Ken Otley, might've heard of me?

12:58.240 --> 12:59.440
-[Tony] No.
-No?

12:59.520 --> 13:01.920
No? I'm involved
in showbiz professionally.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.840
-OK.
-I just run this for a bit of fun.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.080
We do a couple of performances every year.
We've got one in a week or so, actually.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.080
It's a revue show. Uh...

13:09.600 --> 13:11.760
<i>A Night of a 1000 Stars.</i>

13:12.880 --> 13:15.040
-And it's this lot, is it?
-It's these guys, yeah.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.440
Everyone's doing their own thing,
you know, so no arguments.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.880
-[Brian] Free expression!
-[Ken] This is Brian, new face.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.720
-Do you know him?
-[Tony] Yeah, we know Brian.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.000
I'm gonna do stand-up, mate.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.640
-Yeah.
-And I'm doing feminist poetry.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.120
I'm doing <i>Send in the Clowns</i>
with interpretive dance.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.040
Anyway, enough talk.
Come on, let's show them what we do.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.040
-On your feet. Get rid of these chairs.
-Yes, it's me!

13:34.120 --> 13:38.000
Hi. I'm sorry about that night,
I wasn't... I wasn't myself.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.720
Oh, shame. I really enjoyed it.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.120
It was nice to meet someone
as cantankerous as me.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.440
-Mm.
-What on earth

13:43.520 --> 13:45.360
are you covering this shitshow for?

13:45.880 --> 13:46.960
I only started coming

13:47.040 --> 13:49.240
to get out of the house
when my dead husband was home.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.960
I mean, they're twats, but
it was preferable than being around him.

13:52.040 --> 13:52.880
[Tony] Sure.

13:52.960 --> 13:56.400
It's like <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.</i>
I feel like Nurse Ratched.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.600
-See that little fat one?
-Mm.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.360
Oh, I'd love to electrocute him.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.880
-[James] Hello, Brian!
-[Ken] OK, and big people.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.120
-Ken.
-[Ken] Big. Really big.

14:05.200 --> 14:08.400
Come on, in we go, Rebecca.
Jumping up and down a little bit.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.440
Just a little jump,
don't do yourself any mischief.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.600
I can't help it, I just really miss her.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.760
She having it off with anyone else?

14:16.120 --> 14:17.520
-No.
-You?

14:18.320 --> 14:19.520
No, of course I'm not.

14:22.280 --> 14:25.520
There was someone at work
who did say that she liked me, but...

14:27.160 --> 14:30.520
I'm not interested,
and I'm just so fed up at the moment.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.040
Fuck's sake,
we all get fed up and depressed, mate.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.520
Yeah, sorry, I don't mean to...

14:35.400 --> 14:37.880
I mean, what do you do
when you get depressed?

14:37.960 --> 14:39.920
I get twatted with Ratty and the Nonce.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.760
-Right.
-Go to the football. Start a fight.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.600
I hate all this namby-pamby nonsense,
you know?

14:48.080 --> 14:49.640
This bleeding hearts...

14:49.720 --> 14:51.560
[mockingly] "Oh, toxic masculinity,

14:51.640 --> 14:53.120
it's OK to cry!"

14:54.480 --> 14:56.640
It's also OK to have five pints,
drop an E,

14:56.720 --> 14:59.560
and do some fucking trollop from behind
against the bins.

15:02.240 --> 15:03.920
Whatever floats your boat, boy.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.680
I think I've broke my thumb
up some bird's arse.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.840
[Ken] You should come to me
if you want a good story.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.400
I've had a life, let me tell you.
I've had a life.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.520
Your readers'll wanna hear this,
write this down.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.680
Um... I did go to drama school,
so I still act professionally,

15:23.760 --> 15:25.800
but, you know, it's tough
to get the parts these days

15:25.880 --> 15:27.840
if you're white, no offense, you know.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.160
Taught drama at sixth form college
for a while,

15:30.240 --> 15:32.440
do you know it? Full of liars.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.640
Seriously, don't go there.
It's a nest of vipers.

15:36.400 --> 15:40.320
Erm, I'm a talent agent by profession,
25 years in the business.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.920
I've had 'em all through my books,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.800
on the way up, on the way down,
and everything in between.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.280
I could tell you some stories
about the showbiz world

15:47.360 --> 15:48.960
that would make your hair curl.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.720
-Like what?
-[Ken] Bloody hell, where do we start?

15:51.800 --> 15:54.960
Hey, you know what you should do?
Ghostwrite a gossip column for me.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.920
-Right.
-[Ken] This is gonna work. Right!

15:57.000 --> 15:58.080
Come on. Let's do this.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.120
-Grab a chair.
-Yeah.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.320
[Ken] Come on, let's make it happen,
for God's sake!

16:03.600 --> 16:04.640
[Matt] Oh, right.

16:05.640 --> 16:06.880
[bottles clinking]

16:06.960 --> 16:08.000
[sighs]

16:15.800 --> 16:18.000
The thing is, mate,
you've got to take these opportunities

16:18.080 --> 16:20.240
when they offer themselves to you,
you know?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.200
Like that bird at work.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.440
-Yeah.
-Get it while you're young.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.480
[Matt] Oh...

16:28.320 --> 16:30.120
Last week, right, we were, um...

16:30.800 --> 16:34.360
we're pissed up
in Tamburgers in town, yeah?

16:34.960 --> 16:37.480
And this waitress comes over
with the food. Fit.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.280
And she goes, um,

16:39.800 --> 16:42.240
"Is there anything else
I can do for you, gentlemen?"

16:42.320 --> 16:44.120
And it was like, "Ding!"

16:44.200 --> 16:47.800
Five minutes later, me and Ratty
are spitroasting her in the disabled bogs.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.120
Yeah.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.360
I'm banging away from behind, right?

16:52.080 --> 16:54.520
Suddenly,
she takes Ratty's cock out her gob,

16:54.600 --> 16:57.280
turns around to me and goes,
"Do you want fries with that?"

16:58.080 --> 16:59.120
What a star!

16:59.920 --> 17:01.960
Anyway, we come out, and there's this...

17:02.160 --> 17:04.000
gammy little geezer in a wheelchair,

17:04.480 --> 17:06.680
furious 'cause he's had to wait so long.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.080
Yeah. Tuts at me.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.960
So, I lean into him, I go,

17:11.480 --> 17:14.880
"Hope you have as much fun in there
as we just did, you little cunt."

17:19.040 --> 17:20.040
[clicks tongue]

17:21.080 --> 17:22.000
[awkwardly] Yeah.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.240
-Well, this has all been very helpful.
-Cheers.

17:25.320 --> 17:26.160
Yeah.

17:29.480 --> 17:32.360
Right, I've got a story for you.
Listen to this one.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.640
I once had sex with a spirit.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.960
I tell you what,
it weren't consensual either. Oh!

17:38.040 --> 17:39.280
The plot thickens!

17:40.040 --> 17:41.280
PSA.

17:41.840 --> 17:45.440
Paranormal sexual assault,
it happens, OK?

17:45.920 --> 17:49.920
Now, I like to sleep stark bollock naked
on me front, right?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.480
That's my choice.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.440
But some would say
that makes it my fault,

17:54.520 --> 17:57.800
but that's just victim-blaming, in't it?
Nobody expects that.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.840
I tell you something else as well,
I know who done it.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.000
I was bummed...

18:02.520 --> 18:04.320
by the ghost of Liberace.

18:04.760 --> 18:05.840
That's the headline.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.720
Made it easy for the bugger.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.480
Why do you think he chose you?

18:10.840 --> 18:12.560
Well, I might not be the only one!

18:12.640 --> 18:14.760
When this gets out,
probably others will come forward.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.800
That's how it usually happens, in't it?

18:17.280 --> 18:19.240
Good. Well... Yeah...

18:19.320 --> 18:21.800
I think we'll leave you
in the capable hands of...

18:22.320 --> 18:25.800
-Sandy. So, yeah, tell her everything.
-[Ken] Great. I will.

18:25.880 --> 18:26.960
OK? Good.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.640
-Cheers.
-[Lenny] Bye.

18:28.720 --> 18:29.920
-Bye.
-[Tony] All right.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.080
[Ken] Now, Sandy.
Liz Taylor, you remember her?

18:33.160 --> 18:36.400
Friend of a friend of mine worked
on her autopsy, right?

18:36.480 --> 18:40.360
They found out
she was absolutely crammed with love eggs.

18:43.240 --> 18:44.680
-[nurse chuckles]
-I want to know.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.600
-You feel how soft they were?
-Yeah, very soft.

18:46.680 --> 18:50.120
Yeah, we use a bit of softener on them,
no expenses spared here.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.360
-You do them yourself?
-No.

18:51.440 --> 18:55.440
Well, I put them in the washing machine,
I don't manually scrub the towels.

18:57.560 --> 18:58.680
[dejectedly] Hi, Dad.

19:03.320 --> 19:04.520
This was Mum's.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.920
She used to read this to me.

19:09.480 --> 19:10.360
Poems.

19:11.760 --> 19:15.560
You didn't care for it much.
Nor did I. I just liked her reading to me.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.280
"Whose woods these are
I think I know

19:21.000 --> 19:22.840
His house is in the village, though

19:23.600 --> 19:25.400
He will not see me stopping here

19:26.560 --> 19:28.760
-To watch--"
-"To watch his woods...

19:29.480 --> 19:31.200
Fill up with snow."

19:36.640 --> 19:37.640
-[nurse] Hi.
-Hi.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.560
I saw you chatting with Simon,
I didn't want to disturb you.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.280
Yes, I was chatting with Simon,
but, I mean, well...

19:44.760 --> 19:46.200
we're not an item, are we?

19:46.280 --> 19:47.240
[scoffs]

19:47.320 --> 19:48.600
-That was quick.
-No.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.000
Nothing quick about it.
[incredulous chuckle]

19:54.840 --> 19:56.120
Sorry I'm such a flake.

19:56.840 --> 19:57.840
It's OK.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.000
You were right,
I'm not quite ready yet, but...

20:02.000 --> 20:04.880
I'm... getting better, slowly.

20:05.840 --> 20:06.840
Well, that's good.

20:08.080 --> 20:11.000
[Tony] Well, it is, yeah.
I'm trying to be a better person.

20:11.080 --> 20:12.680
From where I was to, you know,

20:12.760 --> 20:14.320
nearly fucking killing myself.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.160
If it wasn't for the dog, I'd be dead.
So, little improvements.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.720
Oh, well, that's great. Thanks for that.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.680
You know, the dog is the only good thing
in your life.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.760
[Tony] Fuckin' hell.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.520
I didn't say that, did I?

20:27.480 --> 20:30.760
You saw what I was like, I was an arsehole
to everyone in the world.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.160
I hated everyone. Do you know why?

20:33.240 --> 20:35.440
'Cause they didn't die of cancer
like Lisa.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.760
Including me.
I hated me, 'cause I didn't die.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.800
And I'd swap places with her tomorrow.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.040
Sorry.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.480
[mournful music plays]

20:44.560 --> 20:45.920
Lisa's got cancer?

20:49.920 --> 20:51.240
No. Not anymore.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.840
Oh, good. [relieved sigh]

20:54.440 --> 20:55.760
Because I love that girl.

20:56.360 --> 20:57.760
Apple of my eye.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.160
Couldn't stand anything to happen to her.

21:05.040 --> 21:05.880
Yep.

21:13.240 --> 21:14.280
Bon appétit.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.760
Oh, wow!

21:18.720 --> 21:19.720
I'm starving.

21:22.080 --> 21:22.960
Wow!

21:23.360 --> 21:24.360
Is it hot?

21:24.920 --> 21:27.040
[giggles, sniffs]

21:27.120 --> 21:28.720
That is fucking rank!

21:29.280 --> 21:30.880
-Is it?
-[Roxy giggles]

21:31.760 --> 21:33.800
Lisa used to pretend it tasted good.

21:34.600 --> 21:37.400
Yeah, but Lisa loved you! [laughs]

21:38.360 --> 21:39.240
She did.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.560
-Oh, no. I didn't--
-No, you're exactly right.

21:43.160 --> 21:46.680
She lied to encourage good behavior.
At least I'd tried, you know.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.640
Women are better than men.

21:50.160 --> 21:53.120
And they never stop trying
to bring us up to their standard.

21:55.160 --> 21:58.360
I mean... you're the only man
who's ever cooked me a meal.

21:59.320 --> 22:02.680
So, technically, that's the best meal
a man has ever cooked you.

22:03.440 --> 22:04.640
-So...
-[chuckles]

22:05.400 --> 22:06.600
How bad is it?

22:08.240 --> 22:09.240
Put it this way,

22:09.320 --> 22:13.160
it's the worst thing
I've had in my mouth today.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.480
-And it's been busy. [laughs]
-Good.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.080
Yeah.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.440
I was and always will be useless
without her.

22:19.520 --> 22:22.240
You're not... Don't say it.
You're not useless.

22:22.320 --> 22:25.760
It's not that I couldn't do anything
without her, it's that I didn't want to.

22:26.760 --> 22:27.880
It was no fun.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.400
I'd come home,

22:30.280 --> 22:34.720
she'd be in the kitchen... cooking,
like, chopping stuff,

22:34.800 --> 22:37.000
feeding the dog, asking me about my day,

22:37.400 --> 22:40.480
giving me advice on stuff, right?
And if she went, "Oh, pass the salt,"

22:40.560 --> 22:42.760
I'd go, "Fuck me,
do I have to do everything around here?"

22:42.840 --> 22:45.240
-[Roxy laughs]
-[Tony chuckles sadly]

22:46.600 --> 22:48.280
[voice breaking] I miss her so much.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.160
[sad music plays]

22:54.840 --> 22:57.080
Have you ever thought
of having a real relationship?

22:58.600 --> 23:00.200
You know, I want what you had.

23:00.720 --> 23:01.920
-Marriage and--
-So...

23:02.600 --> 23:04.600
this brings me to my next point.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.120
I know a guy who's really into you...

23:09.080 --> 23:10.400
and he'd like to meet up.

23:11.360 --> 23:12.920
Do you like a man in uniform?

23:13.800 --> 23:14.800
[surprised gasp]

23:15.640 --> 23:17.120
-Not a copper?
-No.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.600
Soldier?

23:19.680 --> 23:20.560
Postman.

23:23.240 --> 23:26.160
-What's wrong with him?
-Honestly, I don't know where to start.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.720
-Fucking hell!
-No.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.920
He asked me to downplay him.

23:30.280 --> 23:31.720
-Modest.
-Not really.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.760
-No, um...
-OK.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.200
-What does he look like?
-Uh...

23:36.280 --> 23:37.640
Sort of... beard.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.080
Like a hipster?

23:39.160 --> 23:42.120
Well, more like
what the hipsters base their look on.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.480
-Hippie?
-Homeless.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.480
-Nothing wrong with the homeless.
-You're so woke.

23:48.880 --> 23:49.720
So?

23:50.640 --> 23:51.960
Come on, then. Well?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.600
OK. Yeah.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.680
Just tell him, you know...
tell him all about me

23:59.760 --> 24:01.800
-and stuff so there's no weirdness.
-OK.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.800
-Great.
-Great.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.200
He'll be over the moon.

24:05.600 --> 24:06.440
Brilliant.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.360
I'm gonna have to go
'cause I actually need to eat... [laughs]

24:11.440 --> 24:12.760
...before I go to work.

24:12.840 --> 24:15.720
No, that's fair enough. That's fine.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.720
-I'm so sorry!
-Good. No.

24:17.800 --> 24:21.000
You can let yourself out
'cause I need to eat the meal I cooked us.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.920
-I'm sorry. Thank you.
-It's all right.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.200
-[Tony] See you later.
-See you later, lovely.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.600
-I'll tell the postman.
-[Roxy laughs]

24:28.680 --> 24:30.200
-See you later.
-See you later.

[bed squeaks rhythmically]

24:37.360 --> 24:39.160
Mum, have you seen my juggling balls?

24:39.240 --> 24:41.760
Oh... They're probably
where you left them, lovey.

24:41.840 --> 24:43.920
I just thought you might have
put them down somewhere.

24:44.360 --> 24:46.760
Um... I saw 'em in the kitchen earlier.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.880
Yeah. I was practicing in there.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.600
Oh, well done. Night night, darling.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.640
[James] Night, Mummy. Oh...

-[patting]

24:58.600 --> 24:59.640
Night, Lenny.

25:00.120 --> 25:01.080
Can I call you Dad?

25:01.160 --> 25:03.840
-Not at the moment.
-All right. Night night.

Night night.
