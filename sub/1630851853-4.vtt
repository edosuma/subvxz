WEBVTT

00:02.669 --> 00:04.938
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REAL ONES
IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.898
THE FRAGILITY OF BODIES

03:22.802 --> 03:24.938
With this, we realized that
all kids ran over...

03:25.004 --> 03:26.239
lived in Borough 8.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.675
Every network is showing
the accident.

03:28.741 --> 03:30.443
This is much bigger
than the accident, Pato.

03:31.177 --> 03:33.146
This is big. Powerful people
are involved here.

03:33.613 --> 03:34.681
That's the story,
not the accident.

03:35.081 --> 03:36.082
Vilna won't like it.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.685
Cut it out with Vilna, Pato.
I don't know what to do.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.587
I don't care about him.
What do you want me to do?

03:41.154 --> 03:42.288
Do you need me to clear the way?

03:42.755 --> 03:44.591
It's not that hard. I'll call
him and invite him to dinner.

03:45.024 --> 03:46.326
I blow him and that's it.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.795
Don't be a show-off.
Let's think it clearly.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.164
This is a small magazine, Vero.
You know that.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.365
-I know.
-It's prestigious.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.067
We can't afford
a big investigation.

03:55.134 --> 03:57.704
Give me some time.
I swear it won't take long.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.472
-I'm almost on it.
-Where?

03:59.539 --> 04:02.075
I know you want to write
the article, Vero.

04:02.442 --> 04:04.477
I know you.
You're good and ambitious.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.413
But I have journalists working
twice as hard...

04:07.480 --> 04:08.815
because you're not getting
anything out.

04:08.881 --> 04:10.516
You want me to write?
I'll write.

04:11.217 --> 04:12.385
Give me something to write.
Something else.

04:13.319 --> 04:15.288
Don't do this to me, Pato.
You know how this works.

04:15.655 --> 04:16.456
Don't make me lose the article.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.393
If it comes out unfinished,
someone will snatch it.

04:20.893 --> 04:22.095
-Twenty-four hours.
-What?

04:22.595 --> 04:24.864
You have 24 hours
to show me something.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.165
-About what?
-This.

04:26.666 --> 04:27.934
Pato, are you kidding?

04:28.001 --> 04:29.469
No, Vilna is waiting
for an article on trains...

04:29.535 --> 04:30.870
and we'll give it to him.
Twenty-four hours.

04:46.886 --> 04:47.687
And Peque?

04:48.621 --> 04:49.856
He's lying down.
He doesn't want to see anyone.

04:50.490 --> 04:51.324
What's wrong?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.226
I don't know. He says
he has a stomachache.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.496
Son, call me at Silvia's house
if you need anything.

04:56.996 --> 04:58.564
-Do you have her phone?
-Yes.

04:59.632 --> 05:00.867
-Can I come in?
-Yes, sure.

05:01.934 --> 05:02.869
Peque, it's me.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.240
Go away. I'm not feeling well.
Beat it.

05:09.075 --> 05:10.009
What's hurting?

05:13.780 --> 05:16.482
You're a pain. Nothing hurts.
Go away. Come on.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.384
Nothing? Your mom said
you had a stomachache.

05:19.185 --> 05:20.119
Can you leave?

05:22.789 --> 05:23.723
Go away!

05:58.191 --> 05:59.759
-The salt.
-What?

06:02.795 --> 06:03.730
Can you pass the salt?

06:24.684 --> 06:25.718
Here you go.

06:25.785 --> 06:26.886
I followed your advice.

06:27.286 --> 06:29.055
I looked for reports on
clandestine games in La Pampa.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.657
There were four names.
But this one caught my eye.

06:32.592 --> 06:33.459
His name is Juan Garcia.

06:33.926 --> 06:35.261
He may be the guy
we're looking for.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.231
He owns two casinos
in Santa Rosa, La Pampa.

06:38.631 --> 06:40.633
One in San Juan. He has a couple
of reports for illegal games.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.935
They didn't go through.
One case of money laundry...

06:43.336 --> 06:44.937
which was dismissed
for lack of merit.

06:45.505 --> 06:49.675
The address when he came
to Buenos Aires is this one.

06:49.742 --> 06:50.676
Does it ring a bell?

06:51.844 --> 06:53.846
-3874 Julio Argentino Roca.
-Yes.

06:54.647 --> 06:56.482
-It sounds familiar.
-Sure, it does.

06:56.549 --> 06:57.850
It's Roca Park.
It's the car track.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.252
No one lives there.

06:59.852 --> 07:00.787
An apocryphal address.

07:02.121 --> 07:03.556
In which borough
is Roca Park located?

07:04.157 --> 07:05.091
Guess.

07:07.693 --> 07:08.661
This is the only picture
you've got?

07:09.028 --> 07:09.962
Yes, the only one I could get.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.298
Okay, email it to me.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.168
-Thanks, Fede.
-You're welcome.

07:15.234 --> 07:16.169
You're great.

07:18.237 --> 07:19.472
Do you know anything
about the kid in the accident?

07:20.006 --> 07:22.241
No. No one claimed the body.
He's a John Doe.

07:22.308 --> 07:23.176
Where is he?

07:23.643 --> 07:24.444
In the judicial morgue.

07:25.211 --> 07:26.012
-Is Morales still there?
-I think so.

07:27.079 --> 07:28.347
-Good. I'll go there.
-Okay.

07:28.414 --> 07:29.348
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

07:30.817 --> 07:31.651
Vero, wait a minute.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.586
We won't mention
what happened at your house?

07:34.887 --> 07:35.822
What do you want to talk about?

07:36.989 --> 07:38.124
You were with the engine
driver, Valrossa.

07:38.658 --> 07:39.625
Yes, so?

07:39.692 --> 07:41.027
And? Are you sleeping with him?

07:43.896 --> 07:44.964
Sorry.

07:45.498 --> 07:46.899
Did you go to the firing range
and asked for the information?

07:47.400 --> 07:48.267
I didn't need to. I asked him.

07:48.935 --> 07:51.304
-And?
-He admitted he had lied.

07:51.704 --> 07:54.407
He said he went there several
times to practice shooting.

07:55.341 --> 07:56.742
-Why?
-Just in case.

07:57.109 --> 07:58.044
Just in case what happened?

07:59.245 --> 08:00.079
I don't know, Federico.

08:00.947 --> 08:03.483
Since we're asking, did you tell
my dad about the article?

08:03.549 --> 08:04.350
Yes.

08:05.284 --> 08:06.486
-Why?
-I don't know. It came up.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.489
He asked and I told him. I
didn't think it was a big deal.

08:10.723 --> 08:13.626
He's my dad, Fede.
It is always a big deal.

08:27.974 --> 08:28.841
Stop.

08:29.308 --> 08:30.176
I won't play anymore.

08:30.710 --> 08:31.577
Come on, don't be a sissy.

08:32.278 --> 08:33.112
No, I won't play anymore.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.182
Come on. Plus, that jerk
Peque is not coming out.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.450
I'm bored.

08:38.484 --> 08:39.952
-Did you do see him?
-Yes.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.655
It's not true he's sick, right?

08:43.089 --> 08:44.023
I don't know.

08:45.324 --> 08:47.393
You do know.
Something is wrong with Peque.

08:48.694 --> 08:49.495
I swear I don't know.

08:50.429 --> 08:51.797
Don't swear
or you'll go to hell.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.135
I went to see him
and he treated me horribly.

08:57.003 --> 08:57.803
Peque is not like that.

08:59.338 --> 09:00.139
I don't know much.

09:00.907 --> 09:02.608
He only told me
he won't come out...

09:02.975 --> 09:04.911
or sleep because
he has nightmares.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.147
What? What type of nightmares?

09:09.248 --> 09:11.417
He dreamt a kid exploded.

09:13.185 --> 09:14.153
How did he explode?

09:15.521 --> 09:17.390
I don't know. He's terrified.

09:19.525 --> 09:20.793
That's it.
There's nothing more I can say.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.897
The kid's body was destroyed.
I don't have a face to publish.

09:25.932 --> 09:26.866
And the fingerprints?

09:27.433 --> 09:29.635
We sent them to headquarters.
Those things take time.

09:30.603 --> 09:34.307
If he has no priors,
they won't be any good.

09:34.640 --> 09:35.875
-He doesn't have any tattoos?
-No.

09:37.810 --> 09:38.678
-Nothing?
-No.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.980
Not even a supermarket ticket.

09:43.115 --> 09:45.451
Send my regards to your dad.
Tell him I'll call him.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.186
Okay. Thank you very much.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.170
-How are you?
-Fine.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.379
-How's your coworker?
-Bad.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.882
-What did he tell you?
-What you already know.

10:18.851 --> 10:20.453
-Can I talk to him?
-No.

10:22.054 --> 10:23.289
It's the second kid
he runs over.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.592
The first one
was listening to music.

10:27.059 --> 10:27.994
He's crushed.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.231
But I spoke to Romero.

10:33.199 --> 10:34.634
-Who?
-Carlos Romero.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.170
The other engine driver who hit
the kid who was unharmed.

10:38.871 --> 10:39.739
Yes, Jonathan.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.407
Jonathan?

10:44.110 --> 10:45.911
He said he would meet you.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.582
Thanks.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.552
What was the name
of the other kid?

10:53.953 --> 10:57.556
I don't know. He's still
a John Doe. No one claimed him.

11:01.227 --> 11:02.928
What are you doing today?
Do you have some time?

11:04.196 --> 11:05.131
A couple of hours.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.600
Where are we going?

11:56.215 --> 11:57.083
Hi.

11:57.516 --> 11:58.384
Hello, how are you?

11:58.951 --> 12:00.553
We're looking
for the Ayala family.

12:01.821 --> 12:04.356
They moved a long time ago.

12:05.124 --> 12:06.225
How long?

12:07.026 --> 12:09.595
I don't know. Let's see.
About two years ago.

12:10.429 --> 12:11.397
After the kid's accident.

12:12.631 --> 12:16.102
Did they leave an address?
Do you know where they went?

12:16.969 --> 12:19.805
I think they moved back
to Salta. But I'm not sure.

12:20.773 --> 12:21.707
Salta?

12:23.142 --> 12:24.543
Okay, thank you, madam.

12:25.077 --> 12:25.878
Bye.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.960
Look, here. 515.

12:42.628 --> 12:43.562
Let's see.

12:46.932 --> 12:47.867
It's the address that's there.

12:54.039 --> 12:54.974
It can't be right.

12:55.941 --> 12:56.609
It's the address stated there.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.979
But either the addresses
are wrong or people moved out.

13:00.479 --> 13:02.081
I don't mean to be pessimistic,
but we're wasting our time.

13:03.649 --> 13:05.317
There's one more address.
We'll finish with that one.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.654
I think it's that way.

13:12.391 --> 13:14.226
The family didn't speak much.

13:15.327 --> 13:18.397
I only know they moved back
to Paraguay when the kid died.

13:19.265 --> 13:20.766
Did they leave
a number or address?

13:21.267 --> 13:22.268
-Nothing.
-No information.

13:23.102 --> 13:24.770
The kid went to school? Brian?

13:25.871 --> 13:27.072
-I guess so.
-Which one?

13:27.773 --> 13:29.408
-I don't know.
-You don't know.

13:30.609 --> 13:31.477
Okay, thanks.

13:31.877 --> 13:32.812
Do you know if he played soccer?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.614
I think he played at some club.

13:36.215 --> 13:37.917
You don't remember which one?

13:38.584 --> 13:40.352
No. I think he played
indoor soccer.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.221
His shoes
were for indoor soccer.

13:42.721 --> 13:44.857
-Is there a club nearby?
-There are many.

13:45.457 --> 13:46.659
You have Yupanqui, Español.

13:47.226 --> 13:49.895
There's also Madero Central,
El Fortín.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.099
-Thank you.
-Okay, bye.

14:11.984 --> 14:12.918
You were right.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.087
We needed to look into soccer.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.991
The kid ran over by Carranza,
Nahuel, played soccer at a club.

14:19.792 --> 14:20.860
This other kid too.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.030
I don't know the one who died.
I don't know yet. But...

14:45.918 --> 14:47.620
Wait. Calm down. Wait!

14:48.387 --> 14:49.622
I won't calm down.

14:51.657 --> 14:52.758
Look at that. Look.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.828
You see this guy?
He loves hurting people.

14:57.062 --> 15:00.733
But you know what he likes best?
Raping little Jew girls...

15:01.233 --> 15:02.801
who put their noses
where they don't belong.

15:04.103 --> 15:05.838
I don't know
how he's restraining himself.

15:06.272 --> 15:10.109
Use your head. Put your tongue
up your beautiful ass...

15:10.676 --> 15:14.613
if you don't want this guy
to deflower it. Understood?

15:16.081 --> 15:17.683
Do you understand or do you
need me to explain it again?

15:18.751 --> 15:19.685
Let him go.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.554
Do you know where your family
is at this time?

15:24.823 --> 15:26.025
Are you okay, Lucio? Lucio.

15:27.059 --> 15:29.228
-Are you okay?
-Wait. Wait.

15:30.996 --> 15:31.931
What are you doing?

15:36.502 --> 15:37.436
What are you doing, Lucio?

15:38.137 --> 15:39.171
Pick up, damn it!

15:41.974 --> 15:43.943
Hi, baby.
Why weren't you answering?

15:45.678 --> 15:46.612
Are you with the kids?

15:50.049 --> 15:53.218
No, someone took my wallet.
I'm sorry.

15:55.054 --> 15:55.955
I'm a bit upset.

15:58.057 --> 15:58.991
Yes, sure. Relax.

16:00.926 --> 16:01.860
I'll be at work.

16:03.228 --> 16:04.163
Yes, I'll tell you later.

16:06.332 --> 16:08.434
Sure. Take care, love.
Say hi to the kids.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.483
So? Did you like it?

16:25.517 --> 16:27.319
Yes. Can you also put plants?

16:28.087 --> 16:30.856
Of course. Didn't you
see the huge window?

16:31.724 --> 16:34.026
We can place them by the glass.
They need sunlight.

16:35.427 --> 16:38.664
Tell your mom you liked it.
She'll be happy.

16:39.531 --> 16:40.466
I don't know if she'll be happy.

16:41.133 --> 16:44.103
Yes, sure. She'll be happy
if you're happy.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.338
Yes, but she doesn't want
to see you.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.142
Your mom loved me a lot.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.511
Yes, sure.
But she doesn't anymore.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.348
How are you doing?
Are you okay?

16:56.982 --> 16:59.051
Do you know if someone did
something to Peque at the club?

17:00.119 --> 17:02.187
Not that I know of. Why are you
asking? What did he tell you?

17:02.955 --> 17:04.790
Nothing. But he hasn't left
his house in three days.

17:05.824 --> 17:07.960
His mom thinks he's sick.
But it's not true.

17:09.361 --> 17:12.765
Dientes says he's scared,
that he has nightmares.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.099
Nightmares?

17:14.900 --> 17:15.634
What does he dream with?

17:16.535 --> 17:18.604
-A kid who explodes.
-He explodes?

17:19.304 --> 17:20.172
What do you mean?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.040
That's what he told me.

18:13.792 --> 18:17.229
"Trains, deaths and suicides."

18:47.693 --> 18:48.861
Where did you find
that about Luca Prodan?

18:51.196 --> 18:52.331
It wasn't difficult to do it.

18:53.832 --> 18:56.802
He said it amazed him every time
he got to a crossing gate.

18:58.003 --> 18:59.471
In a world which sent
rockets to space,

18:59.972 --> 19:02.040
it was primitive for a wooden
bar to protect us from trains.

19:03.175 --> 19:04.042
He was English, right?

19:04.543 --> 19:05.811
-Italian.
-Yes, European.

19:07.746 --> 19:10.115
Okay, it's not great,
but it'll do.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.119
We'll edit the part
on Luca Prodan and it's a go.

19:14.186 --> 19:15.120
Okay.

19:18.290 --> 19:19.358
You took your time.

19:29.067 --> 19:29.835
Are you relieved?

19:31.270 --> 19:33.839
You didn't write anything on
the kids and the competitions.

19:35.407 --> 19:36.341
No.

19:37.743 --> 19:40.312
And you think that writing
an article on suicides...

19:40.679 --> 19:42.548
and traumatized engine
drivers is enough?

19:45.384 --> 19:48.420
Vero, I'm not Vilna. I know you.

19:53.659 --> 19:54.660
Do you need some days off?

19:57.029 --> 19:59.831
Yes, Pato. I need to finish it.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.035
Okay.

20:04.670 --> 20:05.637
Don't be a stranger.

20:13.779 --> 20:14.913
Try to play inside the court.

20:20.118 --> 20:21.119
Look at a guy who knows
what he's doing.

20:22.654 --> 20:23.789
That fat kid who doesn't move
with rollerblades,

20:24.523 --> 20:25.791
I changed his position
and look at him now.

20:25.857 --> 20:27.192
-Yes.
-Look at him mark.

20:27.659 --> 20:28.627
Move a little, kid.

20:32.264 --> 20:33.198
How are we? Any new kids?

20:34.099 --> 20:34.866
-Nothing yet.
-Well...

20:35.434 --> 20:36.835
Start moving.
The lion will eat us.

20:39.871 --> 20:41.473
And Peque?
I haven't seen him in a while.

20:43.709 --> 20:44.810
He hasn't been here
in three days.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.046
I don't know, he may be sick.
Why don't you ask your kid?

20:48.113 --> 20:49.381
They live in the same house,
right?

20:49.448 --> 20:51.650
Yes, I saw her. I asked her.

20:52.084 --> 20:52.884
What did she say?

20:53.785 --> 20:56.455
That he hasn't left his house
in three days.

20:56.788 --> 20:57.723
Why?

20:59.524 --> 21:01.560
I don't know. She said...

21:03.028 --> 21:06.465
She said he saw a kid exploding
in a million pieces.

21:07.399 --> 21:08.333
Exploding? I don't get it.

21:08.734 --> 21:09.534
I don't either.

21:10.569 --> 21:13.005
Perhaps he saw a kid getting
hurt, something like that.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.976
Kids will say anything to get
their parents' attention.

21:20.812 --> 21:21.747
Maybe.

21:24.883 --> 21:26.351
I don't get why you
don't get to the point.

21:27.486 --> 21:28.654
What do you mean?

21:30.155 --> 21:31.156
You come and ask about Peque
and then you tell me that.

21:32.457 --> 21:33.525
Do you think I have
something to do with that?

21:33.959 --> 21:35.027
No, why would I think that?

21:35.427 --> 21:37.462
Thank goodness. I wouldn't want
your kid to think...

21:37.796 --> 21:39.431
you work with a jerk
who abuses children.

21:40.265 --> 21:41.433
It's enough
that you're a stoner.

21:41.767 --> 21:42.634
I'm not a stoner.

21:43.068 --> 21:44.736
Stoner. I don't know
how that works.

21:44.803 --> 21:45.737
I don't get it.

21:46.838 --> 21:47.706
You already screwed up.

21:48.073 --> 21:48.874
What's lost is lost.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.677
It's important you don't lose
what you have now, get it?

21:57.916 --> 21:59.718
Come on, kid. Use your leg.
Why do you have it?

22:01.119 --> 22:02.287
You can unscrew it
and just leave it on the bus.

22:02.888 --> 22:04.489
Play with your hip.

22:08.527 --> 22:09.394
It's the truth, man.

22:09.795 --> 22:11.129
We left because
the hours went down.

22:11.496 --> 22:12.364
All of them wanted to come.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.267
How can everybody come?

22:15.834 --> 22:17.903
Malvino is crazy!

22:19.638 --> 22:20.972
You're crazy. How can all come?

22:21.373 --> 22:22.708
Do you know who sends
you his regards?

22:24.276 --> 22:25.210
Farías the Turk.

22:26.545 --> 22:29.848
-Farías the Turk.
-Why do you say it like that?

22:30.282 --> 22:31.717
Who's the Turk?

22:31.783 --> 22:32.884
What do you mean?
They hate each other.

22:32.951 --> 22:33.819
With this one?

22:34.419 --> 22:35.687
They both play centerfield.

22:36.621 --> 22:38.156
That's why? They're jealous?

22:38.924 --> 22:42.694
He plays centerfield as a pivot.
He plays with a tunic.

22:43.662 --> 22:45.263
He can't see with his turban.

22:48.600 --> 22:49.534
Why is he called "Turk"?

22:53.605 --> 22:54.539
I don't know.

22:59.444 --> 23:00.379
It's over, guys.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.417
I won't drive a train
ever again.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.486
-Come on...
-No, I already said it.

23:07.986 --> 23:09.054
I'm resigning.

23:10.355 --> 23:11.289
I'm resigning.

23:12.491 --> 23:14.860
Calm down. Wait.
Give it some time.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.995
You're feeling this way now.
Wait.

23:17.629 --> 23:20.198
It's not about time.
I wish it just took time.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.368
Do you know what I feel? Hatred.

23:24.803 --> 23:26.271
That's what I feel. Hatred.

23:27.873 --> 23:31.009
I hate that goddamned kid
who was on the track.

23:32.477 --> 23:34.913
I hate all the goddamned kids
who stand on tracks...

23:35.347 --> 23:36.581
and screwed my life.
That's what I feel.

23:40.852 --> 23:42.454
Why don't you calm down?

23:43.655 --> 23:44.589
Calm down?

23:46.725 --> 23:49.361
I will never be calm again.
Never again.

23:50.462 --> 23:53.432
You know why? Because
of those goddamned kids.

23:54.666 --> 23:55.967
Do you know what I'll do?
I won't resign.

23:57.302 --> 23:59.538
I'll go back to work.
I'll ask for the night shift.

24:00.005 --> 24:03.175
-When I see them on the track...
-Stop...

24:03.608 --> 24:06.611
-I'll run them over.
-Calm down.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.181
I won't turn on the light,
I won't turn on the siren.

24:09.781 --> 24:13.919
I'll crush all of them.
Crush them to pieces.

24:14.820 --> 24:17.422
-It's over.
-Stop.

24:17.489 --> 24:19.357
No. He's right.

24:21.626 --> 24:22.561
Let's make a toast.

24:26.231 --> 24:28.667
To Alfredo, Topo Gomez, Miguel.

24:30.368 --> 24:31.403
Especially, to us.

24:32.771 --> 24:36.241
The ones who screw
our lives can go to hell.

24:49.387 --> 24:50.288
Someone came to see you.

24:51.256 --> 24:52.257
-Who?
-Your coach.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.428
Tell him to leave.

24:58.964 --> 24:59.798
He brought you pastries.

25:00.432 --> 25:02.300
-What the hell do I care?
-Peque, champ.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.203
You didn't go to the club.
I came to see what was wrong.

25:05.537 --> 25:06.471
Your mom says you're sick.

25:09.441 --> 25:10.809
This is our star player,
did you know?

25:11.943 --> 25:13.278
When I saw
that he wasn't coming,

25:13.345 --> 25:14.746
I thought he had been
recruiting by another club.

25:14.813 --> 25:15.747
I nearly had a stroke.

25:17.048 --> 25:18.083
Do you want anything to drink?
Some coffee?

25:18.483 --> 25:20.151
No, thanks.
I just came to say hi.

25:20.218 --> 25:21.086
I need to leave.

25:21.720 --> 25:22.921
Okay, I'll leave you two alone.

25:23.321 --> 25:24.356
I'm going to Silvia's.
I'll be right back.

25:25.790 --> 25:26.725
-See you.
-Bye.

25:30.695 --> 25:31.663
Look what I brought.

25:34.132 --> 25:35.066
Come on, eat.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.068
My belly hurts.

25:37.135 --> 25:38.403
What belly, pansy?
Look at this. It's delicious.

25:39.137 --> 25:40.071
Come on, eat.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.140
I'll be eating alone?

25:44.976 --> 25:48.880
Okay, fine. Let's talk like men.
What's wrong?

25:50.215 --> 25:51.816
-Nothing is wrong.
-Don't say that.

25:52.350 --> 25:53.552
There's clearly something
wrong. I'm not stupid.

25:55.186 --> 25:56.121
I won't go anymore.

25:57.188 --> 25:58.123
Where? The club?

25:58.890 --> 25:59.591
Okay, that's fine.

26:00.692 --> 26:02.694
If you're scared
you're useless to me.

26:02.761 --> 26:03.828
I'll get someone
with bigger balls.

26:04.729 --> 26:05.597
I'm not scared.

26:06.031 --> 26:07.265
It's crucial that you keep
your mouth shut.

26:07.699 --> 26:09.601
I thought I was clear.
What did I tell you?

26:10.368 --> 26:11.303
I don't know.

26:18.510 --> 26:21.012
Vincen acted all macho and
stayed longer on the track.

26:21.546 --> 26:23.181
It's your fault.

26:24.649 --> 26:25.717
Why did it take you
so long to jump?

26:27.552 --> 26:28.486
The best thing is for you
to keep your mouth shut.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.289
-You shouldn't tell anyone.
-I didn't tell anyone.

26:31.656 --> 26:33.291
-You told someone. Who?
-No one.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.126
-Yes, think.
-No one.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.201
I didn't come here
to argue with you.

26:44.336 --> 26:45.270
We're friends, right?

26:46.905 --> 26:49.441
The whole track thing should
remain between us. Is it clear?

26:50.542 --> 26:53.211
You can't tell your mom,
your uncle, your friend.

26:54.679 --> 26:56.047
No goddamned person, okay?

26:57.082 --> 26:58.016
Are we clear?

27:07.859 --> 27:08.793
Okay.

27:10.261 --> 27:12.163
Come by the club any time.
The doors are always open.

27:13.398 --> 27:14.666
I'm leaving. I'll take one.

27:17.002 --> 27:19.070
Bye, Peque.
Send my regards to your mom.

27:46.731 --> 27:47.666
Can you drink something?

27:48.733 --> 27:49.668
Yes, I changed my shift.

27:50.568 --> 27:51.436
What do you want?

27:52.037 --> 27:52.971
Whatever you're taking.

28:17.395 --> 28:18.329
What's wrong?

28:20.965 --> 28:25.904
You can't keep this up.
It's too dangerous.

28:27.338 --> 28:29.641
It's done.
I handed in an article.

28:31.576 --> 28:32.644
A light article
which makes me sick.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.212
But that'll do
to leave us alone.

28:38.883 --> 28:39.818
What did you tell your sister?

28:41.653 --> 28:42.587
Nothing.

28:44.789 --> 28:46.891
I told her I found the car that
way, but nothing was stolen.

28:48.126 --> 28:49.527
But she still worried.

28:50.495 --> 28:52.430
My dad won't stop calling.
It means she told him.

28:53.465 --> 28:54.499
Did you tell her
you were with me?

29:00.138 --> 29:01.072
That's what worries you?

29:04.209 --> 29:05.143
No.

29:18.223 --> 29:20.592
You'll talk to Malvino
and get me an interview.

29:24.529 --> 29:26.231
Didn't you say
you were done with that?

29:27.232 --> 29:29.734
I handed in a crappy article
for them to leave us alone.

29:32.137 --> 29:33.238
But I won't stop.

29:35.507 --> 29:36.574
I asked for some days off.

29:36.641 --> 29:38.443
I will only dedicate
myself to this.

29:41.379 --> 29:43.448
I won't stop until
I find those assholes.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.718
I need to speak to your friends
as soon as possible.

30:24.222 --> 30:25.156
With Romero?

30:26.457 --> 30:27.725
Yes. The other one too.

30:29.527 --> 30:31.029
No, Malvino is too upset.

30:35.767 --> 30:36.701
How many deaths do you have?

30:41.573 --> 30:42.507
Six.

30:43.875 --> 30:44.809
Any kids?

30:47.078 --> 30:48.346
No, thank God.

30:58.323 --> 30:59.290
How do you cope with that?

31:04.429 --> 31:06.197
It's easier during the day.
The problem is at night.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.668
Why at night?
You dream about them?

31:15.139 --> 31:16.541
I dream with the same one
all the time.

31:20.478 --> 31:21.412
Pablo Muñoz.

31:24.048 --> 31:25.116
A 22-year-old kid.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.286
An Economics student
at Moron University.

31:33.157 --> 31:35.627
I was going to the province
and I saw him standing there.

31:37.262 --> 31:38.630
He was by the cross-rail.

31:38.696 --> 31:40.365
Something about him
caught my eye.

31:44.602 --> 31:46.504
Suicidal people usually
act distracted.

31:49.007 --> 31:52.410
They place their bag
and belongings there.

31:55.580 --> 31:59.350
At the last minute, they jump.
Or stand in front.

32:03.721 --> 32:08.793
When I was on my way back
to downtown, he was still there.

32:09.994 --> 32:10.962
I recognized him
because of his clothes.

32:14.666 --> 32:15.967
Either he didn't have
the courage...

32:19.037 --> 32:19.971
or he was waiting for me.

32:25.743 --> 32:28.246
When I was 150 feet away,
he stepped forward.

32:29.948 --> 32:30.882
He looked at me.

32:34.185 --> 32:35.119
He caught my eye.

32:39.390 --> 32:41.092
He didn't look scared at all.

32:44.462 --> 32:45.396
He looked calm.

32:51.035 --> 32:52.470
Every time I dream about him,

32:56.441 --> 32:58.142
the moment is different.

33:00.878 --> 33:01.813
Confusing.

33:07.051 --> 33:08.353
I wonder if that last look...

33:11.656 --> 33:13.057
was meant to tell me something.

33:58.002 --> 33:58.936
Like that.

34:03.174 --> 34:04.108
Harder.

34:20.591 --> 34:22.427
TRAINS, DEATHS, SUICIDES

34:26.864 --> 34:27.932
-Did he arrive?
-No.

34:30.401 --> 34:32.270
We still don't know
the dead kid's identity?

34:32.670 --> 34:34.772
Yes, it's unbelievable,
but no one claimed his body.

34:35.873 --> 34:36.808
-Does my dad know?
-No.

34:37.542 --> 34:38.509
Okay.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.378
Vero, you won't tell me
what happened to the car?

34:42.313 --> 34:44.048
Who told you?
My dad or my sister?

34:45.016 --> 34:47.185
It doesn't matter.
Why don't you tell me the truth?

34:49.420 --> 34:51.722
They were two guys. Lucio was
hit and they threatened me.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.057
I'm fine,
but they made their point.

34:53.825 --> 34:54.792
They want me to stop snooping.

34:55.860 --> 34:56.694
-Did you file a report?
-No.

34:57.361 --> 34:59.697
I did something better.
I gave them what they wanted.

35:00.531 --> 35:03.067
I handed in the piece.
They'll think it's over.

35:03.468 --> 35:06.104
Vero, stop screwing around.
Leave everything.

35:06.571 --> 35:08.439
I know you and my dad think
you're protecting me.

35:09.340 --> 35:10.308
But you're not.

35:10.908 --> 35:12.944
The only way of protecting me
is doing what you're doing.

35:13.744 --> 35:14.679
Helping me.

35:20.785 --> 35:21.919
Lucio told you something, right?

35:23.454 --> 35:25.523
He told me you were writing
an article on the accidents.

35:26.390 --> 35:29.193
I was. I finished it.
It came out today.

35:30.361 --> 35:31.295
Then?

35:33.731 --> 35:35.166
Sometimes you need to do things
for work...

35:35.967 --> 35:37.235
and others for yourself.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.942
There were a series
of accidents involving kids.

35:45.476 --> 35:49.180
From what I found out,
it consists of a specific MO.

35:50.581 --> 35:52.250
The only one who survived
the accidents...

35:52.650 --> 35:54.118
was the kid you hit.

35:55.753 --> 35:57.321
Jonathan.
We can't find him anywhere.

35:59.757 --> 36:02.860
I don't know if you'd like to
tell me what happened that day.

36:02.927 --> 36:03.861
Whatever you can.

36:05.696 --> 36:07.365
I was on the night shift.

36:08.533 --> 36:10.001
Some people don't like
the night shift.

36:10.067 --> 36:14.505
I do because I listen to music,
think. I like... Well, that.

36:15.206 --> 36:19.043
Suddenly, I saw two kids
on the tracks. They were two.

36:20.444 --> 36:24.749
When I saw them,
I turned on the siren.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.386
They didn't move
so I hit the breaks.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.956
But the train doesn't stop
immediately. It's impossible.

36:32.857 --> 36:35.726
I thought I was going to hit
them, that they were suicidal.

36:37.528 --> 36:40.898
Nothing.
So, one jumps to the side.

36:41.465 --> 36:43.267
Then the other jumps.

36:44.735 --> 36:45.670
I felt the crash.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.474
After so many years driving
these things,

36:50.541 --> 36:51.409
you realize everything.

36:51.909 --> 36:54.779
I realized I had hit him.

36:55.846 --> 36:58.783
When it comes to a stop,
I get off and look for him.

36:59.350 --> 37:00.751
It was dark outside.

37:01.586 --> 37:03.921
I saw him get up with a limp
and get into a car.

37:05.189 --> 37:06.190
Excuse me, in a car?

37:07.158 --> 37:08.993
He gets up with a limp
and gets inside a car?

37:09.393 --> 37:10.861
Yes, I found it weird as well.

37:10.928 --> 37:13.130
It seemed someone
was waiting for him.

37:13.197 --> 37:14.065
Did you tell that to anyone?

37:14.599 --> 37:15.900
Yes, I told
the police everything.

37:16.434 --> 37:19.170
They wouldn't listen to me.
They asked if I was sure.

37:19.670 --> 37:21.806
It was dark,
perhaps I was in shock.

37:22.473 --> 37:23.574
Can you describe the car?

37:24.508 --> 37:25.376
Gray.

37:25.977 --> 37:28.212
Gray. But was it big, small?
Two doors, four doors?

37:28.646 --> 37:30.781
No, it was gray.
I remember it had rims.

37:31.349 --> 37:32.350
Rims?

37:32.717 --> 37:37.255
Yes, it looked pimped.
Tinted glasses. The rims.

37:37.688 --> 37:41.993
It had many things for an old
car. I don't know if it's clear.

37:42.460 --> 37:43.728
Yes, perfectly.

37:44.695 --> 37:47.031
Gray Car + Traffic Accidents

39:04.408 --> 39:07.478
Excuse me. I need to go
to block four, 39 Street.

39:20.825 --> 39:23.728
This says block four.

39:23.794 --> 39:26.430
Go up to the La Paz sign
and turn left.

40:11.375 --> 40:12.309
Who's that?

40:14.278 --> 40:15.546
She's hot.

40:16.547 --> 40:17.481
You're a beauty.

40:19.116 --> 40:20.050
Did you lose something, baby?

40:21.719 --> 40:23.821
-Nice bitch.
-Come here.

40:24.755 --> 40:25.923
Come.

40:27.158 --> 40:28.092
Don't be scared.

40:31.128 --> 40:32.229
You must be from around here.

40:33.764 --> 40:34.932
Look at that.

40:40.237 --> 40:41.172
Hi.

40:42.373 --> 40:43.307
Can I help you?

40:48.813 --> 40:51.982
I know him because he used
to come to the soup kitchen.

40:53.317 --> 40:55.486
I was at his house today
looking for his family.

40:55.553 --> 40:56.353
There was no answer.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.723
They don't live there anymore.
They left recently.

41:00.491 --> 41:03.394
The house was empty.
New people came.

41:08.098 --> 41:09.767
-Hi, kids.
-Hi.

41:09.834 --> 41:10.634
Are you playing figurines?

41:11.235 --> 41:13.237
-The cards.
-Cards?

41:14.638 --> 41:15.606
Do you also play with these?

41:20.277 --> 41:21.078
This is Vincen's, right?

41:21.812 --> 41:23.214
-What?
-It's Vincen's.

41:24.281 --> 41:25.382
Vincen?

41:25.850 --> 41:27.585
How did he give it to you?
He doesn't lend them to anyone.

41:29.119 --> 41:31.522
I don't know. Maybe.
Where did you find it?

41:33.157 --> 41:34.325
When was the last time
you saw your son?

41:35.125 --> 41:35.926
That's what he does.

41:36.827 --> 41:39.697
He disappears for two days
or a week. He always comes back.

41:40.598 --> 41:42.666
Carmen, he might be
in trouble now.

41:43.400 --> 41:46.470
As usual. I can't stand it
anymore. I'm tired.

41:47.071 --> 41:49.974
I need to take care of the kids.
I can't be on that.

41:50.474 --> 41:52.243
He might have had an accident.

41:52.943 --> 41:53.878
What accident?

41:56.914 --> 42:01.018
Excuse me. I can't stay here,
I have many things to do.

42:01.585 --> 42:03.053
If I hear anything from Vincen,
I'll let you know.

42:03.487 --> 42:04.388
Excuse me.

42:07.892 --> 42:09.126
It might not be the kid.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.007
Come on, man.

42:25.643 --> 42:27.111
Walk it off, come on.

42:45.029 --> 42:45.896
Come on.

42:46.463 --> 42:49.733
You'll grab the ball
if we put some cheese on it.

42:50.267 --> 42:51.435
Really? Come on.

42:52.503 --> 42:53.470
You never pass it.

42:53.804 --> 42:55.606
Hey, Valrossa.
What's with the journalist?

42:55.673 --> 42:56.607
Did you screw her?

43:00.077 --> 43:01.245
It's impossible.

43:01.645 --> 43:03.847
If he screws anyone, his wife
will hang him by the balls.

43:04.748 --> 43:06.183
Those girls are very easy.

43:07.117 --> 43:08.285
You insist a bit and
their eating off your hand.

43:09.219 --> 43:10.754
From the dick, not the hand.

43:12.289 --> 43:13.223
She's very pretty.

43:14.992 --> 43:16.994
I don't give a damn
if you screw her or not.

43:18.295 --> 43:19.630
Cut it out.

43:20.965 --> 43:21.999
It's a joke.

43:22.066 --> 43:23.968
I don't want her
snooping around, okay?

43:26.937 --> 43:28.205
I can invite whoever
I want on my train.

43:30.908 --> 43:32.042
Do I need to ask you?

43:33.177 --> 43:34.712
-Are you up for it?
-Don't doubt it.

43:36.981 --> 43:38.115
-Don't fight.
-Come on.

43:38.716 --> 43:39.817
-Stop, stop.
-Calm down.

43:40.451 --> 43:42.620
Don't lead him on. Stop.

43:44.688 --> 43:46.757
You'll be in trouble.
Remember me.

43:48.125 --> 43:50.194
-Come on, cut it out.
-What's wrong?

43:51.428 --> 43:52.796
What's with the fight?

43:55.032 --> 43:55.966
Calm down.

44:09.046 --> 44:09.980
What do you know?

44:11.715 --> 44:13.350
I told you this girl
would chill.

44:15.786 --> 44:17.121
I think there's another hero
sticking his nose...

44:17.554 --> 44:18.455
where it doesn't belong.

44:19.123 --> 44:21.492
Valrossa? We paid him a visit.

44:21.992 --> 44:23.193
He won't want to continue
screwing with us.

44:23.727 --> 44:26.930
Not Valrossa. Another one.
An attorney.

44:27.865 --> 44:31.101
Yes, sure. We're following him.
He's no one.

44:32.936 --> 44:34.805
Stay on him.
I don't want any surprises.

44:37.341 --> 44:39.343
The kid's family? The last one?

44:40.110 --> 44:42.546
They don't know anything.
He's still a John Doe.

44:44.114 --> 44:45.949
I checked it.
Everything is under control.

44:47.184 --> 44:48.686
Okay. But be careful.

44:49.553 --> 44:50.554
The less fuss the better.

45:54.618 --> 45:57.821
I'll try to speak to Carmen and
see if she says anything else.

45:57.888 --> 45:59.056
I can't promise anything.

45:59.523 --> 46:01.325
That's fine.
I think I made a mistake.

46:02.159 --> 46:02.993
But thanks for your help.

46:03.827 --> 46:04.962
-We'll keep in touch.
-Okay.

46:05.329 --> 46:06.263
Whatever you need.

46:08.599 --> 46:09.533
Can I see the card?

46:11.568 --> 46:12.503
Yes.

46:17.407 --> 46:20.177
He was killed, right?
My brother was killed?

46:21.678 --> 46:22.713
It's his? You recognize it?

46:23.814 --> 46:25.048
-Yes.
-What's your name?

46:26.784 --> 46:28.552
Milagros. Was he killed?

46:29.019 --> 46:29.953
Why do you say that?

46:31.088 --> 46:32.456
Because Vincen is always
in trouble.

46:33.624 --> 46:34.892
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

46:36.126 --> 46:37.494
-Everything.
-For example?

46:38.796 --> 46:41.198
I don't know.
He had 500 pesos once.

46:41.565 --> 46:45.035
I thought he had stolen them
so I slapped him.

46:45.903 --> 46:47.538
He said it was not true,
that he had earned them...

46:48.038 --> 46:49.907
competing with others.

46:50.607 --> 46:51.408
Competing how?

46:52.376 --> 46:53.443
I don't know.
That's what he said.

46:55.846 --> 46:58.081
Besides the kids at school,
who are his friends?

46:59.016 --> 47:00.717
I don't know, he's on
the streets all the time.

47:01.985 --> 47:03.921
-Does he play soccer?
-Yes.

47:05.289 --> 47:06.857
Indoor soccer. He wants
to be a soccer player.

47:08.125 --> 47:09.259
In which club?
Do you know the name?

47:10.794 --> 47:15.299
SOCIAL AND SPORT CLUB
ROCA JUNIORS
