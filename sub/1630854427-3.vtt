[eagle screeching]

00:09.000 --> 00:10.320
What's up there for you?

00:10.400 --> 00:11.800
-Land claim.
-[Cornelia] Where?

00:11.880 --> 00:13.600
-[Eli] Nebraska.
-Is that far?

00:13.680 --> 00:14.800
Not as far as you wanna go.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.640
[John] You know
the greatest enemy to an Indian?

00:18.720 --> 00:20.200
Our past.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.400
We have to turn our back on it.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.040
I got a knack for survival.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.440
What's in her bags?

00:27.200 --> 00:29.960
-Nothing worth dying for.
-So hand them over.

[gun cocks]

00:36.960 --> 00:38.440
Oh, my God.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.120
We have to get somewhere safe
for the both of them.

00:41.640 --> 00:44.280
[Eli] I get what you gotta do
and why you gotta do it,

00:44.360 --> 00:47.080
but I've been here before
and I ain't going back.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.080
I brought you something.

00:50.680 --> 00:51.600
Thank you.

00:51.680 --> 00:52.960
[horse whines]

00:54.440 --> 00:55.360
[Sheriff] Mister Trafford.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.520
[Thomas] That was a 13-week
gestated Hereford cross.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.440
A hundred more lying up there,
all ripped out the same.

01:03.520 --> 01:07.280
What kind of community
you got going on up here, Sheriff?

01:07.400 --> 01:10.080
-Billy Myers, remember him?
-Uh-hmm.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.360
Lonnie's brother. I hear he's up there.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.080
Caine County or some such.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.560
You might wanna look him up,
tell him we finally got him.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.880
We finally got Lonnie's killer.

01:33.960 --> 01:38.120

02:31.120 --> 02:32.440
[Billy] You hear that?

[theme music playing]

04:11.080 --> 04:14.000
[birds squawking]

04:20.800 --> 04:22.600
[Red] How was it they allowed him in?

04:22.680 --> 04:24.360
[Sheriff] For shooting his wife.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.800
[Red] And then for killing himself.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.120
We put everyone like that at a crossroads.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.240
This is where the cemetery would be.

04:33.360 --> 04:37.240
Well, it's a nice spot.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.600
Better hope it doesn't fill up too quick.

04:44.360 --> 04:47.800
No. No, those days are done.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
[indistinct chatter]

04:55.680 --> 04:59.720
[Sheriff] Mr. Myers. How can I help?

04:59.800 --> 05:03.920
[dramatic music playing]

05:30.880 --> 05:32.800
[Martha] There's been a cattle break,

05:32.880 --> 05:34.360
but I know where there'll be.

05:36.560 --> 05:37.840
Where is he?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.600
[sighs]

05:44.840 --> 05:47.320
[Sherriff] It's fine, Mr. Myers.

05:48.520 --> 05:49.760
Take your time.

05:51.200 --> 05:56.240
Tim-Timothy Flynn, what, shot hisself?

05:56.320 --> 06:00.400
-Uh-huh.
-Who, uh-- who saw his body?

06:00.480 --> 06:01.480
I did.

06:01.560 --> 06:07.480
Were there, uh-- were there any marks?

06:07.560 --> 06:08.920
[Sheriff] Marks?

06:11.920 --> 06:14.160
Yeah. On him.

06:14.240 --> 06:17.960
He put a barrel to his mouth, so...

06:24.560 --> 06:27.920
What exactly is it you're looking for?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.160
[sighs]

06:47.040 --> 06:48.800
No marks on Timothy Flynn?

06:49.360 --> 06:53.200
Only took him in down to his johns,
closed casket and all.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.480
To be honest with you,
if wasn't for Mr. Melmont,

06:56.560 --> 06:59.320
lucky they didn't go down
in a couple of old gunny-sacks.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.440
-Melmont?
-Paid for the coffins.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.480
She had cow pox.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.320
Mrs. Flynn. On her hand.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.440
[horse neighs]

[indistinct chatter]

07:43.240 --> 07:45.120
[horse neighs]

07:45.200 --> 07:46.640
[Martha] Come on. Hey.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.200
Hey.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.200
-[Jackson] Hey!
-That's mine.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.320
So is that! So is that!

08:03.400 --> 08:05.160
You cut them up and give them back!

08:05.240 --> 08:07.440
Relax. Cool down, ma'am.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.320
-Mrs. Myers.
-You got my cattle.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.520
How's that?

08:18.320 --> 08:20.520
-Look.
-At what?

08:20.600 --> 08:23.120
-That's my cut.
-That?

08:23.720 --> 08:26.880
-That's not a registered brand.
-Those are my cattle.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.080
Ma'am, all unbranded cattle
found on the open range

08:30.160 --> 08:33.160
become the property
of the Stock Growers' Association.

08:33.240 --> 08:38.480
And as you are not an Association member,
this stock does not belong to you.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.640
Don't go thinking, you're no gentleman.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.280
Been here since '75.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.600
Long since divested myself
of that illusion.

09:00.640 --> 09:01.520
Huh?

09:02.080 --> 09:03.280
I'm not a gentleman.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.600
That why you steal my cattle?

09:08.160 --> 09:09.440
They were in the open.

09:10.720 --> 09:14.440
I'm glad they done sliced up your cows.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.480
-Well, that was a crime.
-This is a crime.

09:16.520 --> 09:20.520
It's a mistake of anyone
to give the likes of Billy Myers

09:20.640 --> 09:22.520
and Timothy Flynn
the chance to start again.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.000
And Flynn just went and blew
his wife's head off,

09:26.080 --> 09:29.520
so if I was you,
I'd put a lock on my gun box.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.280
Don't you go threatening me.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.760
I'm not. Threat's already in your bed.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.640
Is that like a Prussian thing?
Are you asking me to dance?

09:43.720 --> 09:45.880
-I'm Austrian.
-Right.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.520
So which one wears the pointy hats?

09:48.600 --> 09:49.760
This is my country.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.120
Those are my cattle.

09:58.520 --> 10:00.000
Compliments on your riding.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.840
[Thin] Help you there, ma'am?

10:29.960 --> 10:31.400
Let her go, boys.

10:31.480 --> 10:34.000
[horses whine]

10:34.080 --> 10:36.000
[Thomas] Did you round them
up deliberately?

10:36.080 --> 10:40.640
Anything with Billy Myers' name on it
is fair game by my book.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.600
[sighs]

11:02.680 --> 11:04.200
Where is he?

11:08.840 --> 11:10.360
[sighs]

11:12.040 --> 11:14.240
No, Ma. Please.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.000
[sighs]

11:18.960 --> 11:20.760
You're flat.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.120
[Sheriff] Dear God.

11:50.400 --> 11:53.960
I think we need a word with Billy Myers.

11:54.040 --> 11:57.040
[dramatic music playing]

12:21.480 --> 12:24.400
[Jed panting]

12:33.240 --> 12:34.880
Oh, my God.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.440
[horse neighs]

12:46.880 --> 12:48.720
Hey!

12:48.800 --> 12:51.520
[dramatic music playing]

13:14.200 --> 13:16.360
Haema-- say it again.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.040
[Jenson] Haematozoa.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.000
Haematozoa.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.720
How do they get in?

13:22.800 --> 13:24.280
Tick bite.

13:24.360 --> 13:29.360
Cow gets bit, parasite gets
into the blood, gets inside the cells,

13:29.440 --> 13:32.200
multiplies, then they burst out,
and the whole thing starts over.

13:32.280 --> 13:36.160
Before long,
you got a thousand head of dying cattle

13:36.240 --> 13:40.200
just 'cause they got nipped by a creature
no bigger than my pinky nail.

13:40.280 --> 13:43.800
Oh. So you're looking for ways
to treat it?

13:43.880 --> 13:45.040
-Found one.
-[Cornelia] Hmm.

13:45.120 --> 13:49.240
You heard of a fella named Charles Darwin?

13:49.320 --> 13:51.120
[chuckles] English like yourself.

13:51.200 --> 13:55.360
-I have.
-Nature, red in tooth and claw.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.680
You know, I think
that might actually be Alfred Tennyson.

14:00.520 --> 14:03.400
It is a way to harness nature, ma'am,
is what it is.

14:03.480 --> 14:06.200
And that is what we intend to do
with this.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.440
Take the parasite, kill the parasite,
put it back in the body.

14:09.520 --> 14:12.920
That way, next time a live one comes
along, body knows it already.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.520
-Hmm.
-Just goes right ahead and eats it all up.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.640
And I am of the personal opinion
that in short order,

14:19.720 --> 14:22.520
all the ills of the world
may be similarly treated,

14:22.600 --> 14:26.480
whether it be a tick or an Indian.

14:28.040 --> 14:31.520
An Indian? And how might that be?

14:31.600 --> 14:35.960
-Acculturalization.
-A, what?

14:36.040 --> 14:39.320
What the body does to the parasite,
society must do to the Indian.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.880
-Kill him.
-Absorb him.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.560
How might you do that?

14:45.640 --> 14:48.200
You wanna survive in a White man's world,
you have to become one.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.400
-Simple as that.
-And that's science?

14:51.480 --> 14:53.520
That, ma'am, is Tennyson.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.800
So I noticed you're wearing a knife.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.360
No, no, no. Please. I understand.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.160
A stranger has joined your firesides.

15:04.240 --> 15:07.240
Biology may indeed be our sole creator

15:07.320 --> 15:10.360
but morality must remain
our constant guide.

15:13.040 --> 15:16.080
I wish you well with the delivery
of those dear children

15:16.160 --> 15:18.120
and praise you for your brave intent.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.600

[dramatic music playing]

16:18.000 --> 16:19.360
I know you're not shot.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.680
I did not aim to shoot you.

16:25.640 --> 16:26.960
Just him.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.560
Because you went where you should not.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.800
Don't bother to send anyone after.

17:48.080 --> 17:53.160
The vultures in Kansas leave no trace.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.160
[dramatic music playing]

18:11.560 --> 18:13.160
Where am I not to go?

18:23.080 --> 18:24.440
[dramatic music playing]

18:42.400 --> 18:43.400
It's all right.

18:44.920 --> 18:45.920
[sighs]

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
[dramatic music playing]

19:56.160 --> 19:58.000
[chuckles] Oh.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.560
Smaller pieces great for grinding.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.560
Bigger in that one for the furnace.

20:06.680 --> 20:09.400
Finest bone meal this side of Topeka.

20:09.480 --> 20:10.400
Buffalo?

20:10.480 --> 20:13.280
Was a time you could cross this whole yard

20:13.320 --> 20:15.280
on nothing but tailbones.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.560
Why not get the corn in first?

20:17.680 --> 20:18.720
Huh?

20:20.320 --> 20:23.320
No. That's last year's surplus.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.960
Just leaving them to rot?

20:27.520 --> 20:30.160
Way I heard it, you Pawnee...

20:31.480 --> 20:33.400
it was the women did all the farm work.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.720
You men just sat around horse-lifting.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.920
Horses look good too.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.760
-They do.
-That how you make your money?

20:45.760 --> 20:47.480
Because the way I heard it,

20:47.560 --> 20:49.960
market's been dead for corn a year now

20:50.040 --> 20:51.800
and buffalo don't need no explanation.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.040
Don't go guessing at my business, son.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.440
Don't go telling me who I should be.

20:56.520 --> 20:57.720
Don't wanna argue with you.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.080
You can be who you want...

21:00.200 --> 21:01.520
so long as you pay your debt.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.480
For a compass?

21:03.560 --> 21:04.560
Fine one.

21:05.480 --> 21:09.520
Fine enough to steer your lady friend
right back into your heart, hmm?

21:11.320 --> 21:15.040
I can see you wanna break some bones.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.080
[dramatic music playing]

21:21.560 --> 21:22.560
Oh.

21:23.560 --> 21:25.680
That wagon you came in by...

21:27.040 --> 21:28.880
got someone take it at a price.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.200
Not mine to sell.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.040
Not yours to keep then either.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.520
[chuckles]

21:34.200 --> 21:36.160
So you don't mind if I do.

21:36.240 --> 21:37.680
Fair's a share.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.800
[dramatic music playing]

21:59.240 --> 22:00.680
[Evan] Ma.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.040
[horse whines]

22:09.200 --> 22:10.200
Hmm.

22:11.120 --> 22:16.360
If there's any good come from having spat
you two out of my pelvis,

22:16.440 --> 22:19.760
it's getting up there on this fat-fuck.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.440
So...

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
what've we got?

22:25.640 --> 22:28.720
[tense music playing]

22:34.640 --> 22:37.000
It will be fine, all right?

22:37.080 --> 22:38.080
Uh-hmm.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.160
[gun cocks]

22:48.240 --> 22:51.240
[tense music playing]

23:09.800 --> 23:12.040
[Black-Eyed Mog]
180 for the wagon.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.640
300 for the horses.

23:15.400 --> 23:16.840
20 for the harness.

23:17.600 --> 23:21.920
Maybe 15 for the rifle, unless it's a '73.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.320
Bits and pieces.

23:24.400 --> 23:28.360
500, 550 tops.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.440
I don't know, boys.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.640
You wanna dip your wicks
into something warm,

23:35.720 --> 23:37.320
you go right ahead.

42:27.120 --> 42:29.080
Killing and thieving,

42:32.200 --> 42:34.640
you ain't got the stomach for this,
do you?

42:36.200 --> 42:37.480
Lady like you?

42:45.360 --> 42:46.800
That's it.

42:46.880 --> 42:48.280
Shh.

42:48.360 --> 42:50.800
There you go.

42:50.880 --> 42:52.320
That's it.

42:52.840 --> 42:54.080
[grunts]

43:02.800 --> 43:04.280
[groans]

43:11.680 --> 43:14.280
Well, hell.

43:17.280 --> 43:19.600
Shived by a cracker.

43:32.760 --> 43:34.080
Eli!

43:35.400 --> 43:36.600
Eli!

43:44.720 --> 43:46.040
[pants]

44:01.000 --> 44:02.560
[gasps]

44:28.680 --> 44:29.680
It's a shock...

44:32.640 --> 44:36.240
to see the exact value of a man's life

44:36.320 --> 44:37.520
laid out on a table.

44:37.600 --> 44:40.200
Saw his horse in the corral.

44:40.280 --> 44:41.760
Wouldn't have left without it,

44:41.840 --> 44:45.200
or them, or me, I'd hazard.

44:47.280 --> 44:49.160
So where is he?

44:49.240 --> 44:51.440
-Who'd you sell him up to?
-Didn't.

44:51.520 --> 44:53.840
-Okay.
-[gun cocks]

44:55.680 --> 44:57.840
So seeing
as we're weighing up values here,

44:57.920 --> 44:59.440
how much for you?

44:59.520 --> 45:00.880
-Take it.
-[Cornelia] Take it?

45:00.960 --> 45:03.040
You don't think you're worth a bit more?

45:03.920 --> 45:07.160
I mean, you did say that Eli
was just a backward-looking Pawnee,

45:07.240 --> 45:08.600
do you remember?

45:08.680 --> 45:11.000
So a bit more, I think.

45:18.840 --> 45:20.320
Is that it?

45:20.400 --> 45:21.600
That's your lot?

45:23.840 --> 45:25.200
Every single cent?

45:29.560 --> 45:30.560
Ah.

45:33.360 --> 45:34.480
That's it.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.640
Maybe you don't value yourself enough.

45:39.720 --> 45:41.360
I already found gold under your mattress.

45:42.200 --> 45:44.080
That's everything.

45:44.160 --> 45:45.440
I swear.

45:45.520 --> 45:47.520
Okay. Thank you.

45:53.080 --> 45:55.080
Now what about your wife?

45:57.840 --> 46:00.560
How are you going to pay for her

46:00.640 --> 46:04.400
now that you've given up everything
just to save yourself, I'd think.

46:06.760 --> 46:08.040
Think carefully.

46:08.920 --> 46:11.080
Because if you haven't
already given me everything,

46:11.160 --> 46:13.720
well, then you haven't
even saved yourself. [chuckles]

46:16.480 --> 46:17.520
[groans]

46:19.840 --> 46:22.920
Do you know the first time out here
I tried this?

46:24.000 --> 46:26.240
This. And I gotta be honest,

46:26.320 --> 46:29.280
I just-- oh, I ended up flat on my face.

46:30.800 --> 46:33.240
But then, I don't know,
I don't know, six hours later,

46:33.320 --> 46:35.160
the man who did it,

46:35.240 --> 46:37.040
he ended up flat on his face.

46:39.080 --> 46:42.080
And he had a knife
sticking out right here.

46:45.080 --> 46:47.720
There's just something about this country.

46:49.400 --> 46:52.400
And you know your wife's is right here.

46:54.800 --> 46:56.280
Nasty wound.

46:56.360 --> 46:59.360
She won't last long,
so don't you dilly-dally.

47:00.520 --> 47:01.520
What do you want?

47:03.800 --> 47:05.440
What I just asked you,

47:06.480 --> 47:08.880
except this time
you're going to give me everything

47:08.960 --> 47:11.320
because that is how much
my friend is worth.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.240
So where is he?

47:52.480 --> 47:54.600
[Kills on Water]
My name's Kills on Water.

47:56.200 --> 47:57.600
You don't know me...

48:05.280 --> 48:07.160
but I've been looking for you.

48:08.760 --> 48:10.400
Long time.

48:30.040 --> 48:31.360
You want this back?

48:34.080 --> 48:36.280
Tell me everything you know...

48:38.080 --> 48:40.760
about the massacre at Chalk River.

48:41.440 --> 48:44.440
[dramatic music playing]
