Right.

12:36.298 --> 12:37.287
Oh, Hannah.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.926
I wanted to
return this to you.

12:47.017 --> 12:48.302
But it's yours.

12:50.312 --> 12:54.646

sentimental value for you.

You were born at
Lenox Hill Hospital
in New York City.

he stitched your name on here.

13:09.081 --> 13:11.823

He had never stitched
a thing in his life.

13:15.587 --> 13:16.963
What was he like?

13:17.047 --> 13:20.665
He had an overdeveloped
sense of self-preservation.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.215
And ambition.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.929
He built this machine.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.672

13:28.850 --> 13:34.345

to Change time.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.896

I was a small Child,

13:41.530 --> 13:43.145
I was found
floating down a river

13:43.240 --> 13:47.529
on the back of a golden swan
that I had tamed.

13:48.412 --> 13:51.529
Now, Mother says
I was brought to her
because of you,

13:52.040 --> 13:55.532

to Cheat death.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.384

Now, your machine is
going to finish off
what's left of us.

14:16.773 --> 14:20.436
This is every record
we have, and no mention
of Titan anywhere.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.438

14:22.571 --> 14:24.812
Maybe it's not real.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.424
What is a database?

It's a place where
information is collected
and stored.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.011

He's like your database.

after the old ones died.

from trading with The Keeper,

You know what that means?

40:21.253 --> 40:22.914
It means "time."

40:23.672 --> 40:24.661
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

40:25.090 --> 40:27.251
Mother is not
without her sense of humor.

40:28.135 --> 40:29.170
Oh.

40:29.303 --> 40:31.669
You asked me
about your father.

40:36.476 --> 40:38.467
I think he looks like you.

40:39.521 --> 40:41.136
He was quite
a brilliant man.

40:41.273 --> 40:42.979
He only ever
gave me two things.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.518
This machine and you.

40:46.653 --> 40:49.440
But you were the only thing
lever loved him for.

40:51.283 --> 40:52.614
Thank you.

40:55.662 --> 40:59.325
If you like,
you may call me Hannah.

41:04.338 --> 41:07.000
ELLIOT: Another
brilliant mind lost.

41:08.342 --> 41:10.173
I know what that's like.

41:10.302 --> 41:11.417
'Cause I could
have been the man

41:11.511 --> 41:13.502
that science
mistook for a magician.

41:13.639 --> 41:18.258
Me and Tesla
and Ben Franklin
and his kite, you know.

41:18.352 --> 41:20.138
But nope, 'Cause
they pull your funding.

41:20.479 --> 41:23.016
They find one dead body
in your facility and...

41:23.148 --> 41:24.433
(IMITATES EXPLOSION)
They mothball the future.

41:24.524 --> 41:26.776
And then they discredit you.
(SCOFFS)

41:26.860 --> 41:28.725
And I'm not dead,
but I might as well be.

41:37.412 --> 41:40.324
Do you believe in
resurrection, Doctor?

41:41.500 --> 41:44.992
Man, I'm afraid
I've become a realist
in my failed state.

41:45.087 --> 41:48.875
Enough to know that
this idea that you're
talking about is impossible.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.122
How so?

41:50.217 --> 41:53.129
The technology
doesn't exist, man.
It would take...

41:53.220 --> 41:55.836
I don't know, shit, decades.

41:56.556 --> 41:58.968
Unless you, you know...

41:59.059 --> 42:01.220
Regardless,
let me ask you something.

42:01.311 --> 42:06.055
Even if I could
build this for you,
why would you want it?

42:06.650 --> 42:07.856
Insurance.

42:08.193 --> 42:09.649
(SCOFFS) Against what?

42:10.070 --> 42:11.480
The future.

42:11.738 --> 42:13.649
(CHUCKLING) Huh.

42:19.413 --> 42:21.404
This project is massive.

42:21.707 --> 42:22.867
It is.

42:28.839 --> 42:30.875
That's why we're
calling it Titan.
