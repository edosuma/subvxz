WEBVTT

00:12.887 --> 00:15.390
Oh, look at the family tree!

00:15.432 --> 00:18.935
Finally through one challenge.
A whole lot more to go.

00:18.977 --> 00:23.231
Anybody who can simulate
an underground pork roast...

00:23.273 --> 00:26.109
You deserve the win.
Bow down. You got it.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.569
Thank you!

00:27.610 --> 00:30.530
This smells like
an emu back home.

00:30.572 --> 00:33.074
The winning chefs
are Ocean and Jaydene.

00:33.116 --> 00:36.494
-Congratulations!

00:36.536 --> 00:38.246
I think we can
make it all the way.

00:38.288 --> 00:41.750
We just have to make sure that
we stay true to what we do,

00:41.791 --> 00:44.252
and to just shine a light
on our hometown

00:44.294 --> 00:46.004
that we're so proud of.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.798
They're telling us so much
stuff that we need to change.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.508
It doesn't feel great
being in the bottom.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.093
My ego's a little hurt.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.762
Garnishes cannot be uneven.

00:53.803 --> 00:56.348
Great texture,
but very difficult to eat.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.892
But it was good, 'cause
we made all the mistakes

00:58.933 --> 00:59.976
that you can make early.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.770
New day, fresh start.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.274
-Oh my God!

01:06.316 --> 01:09.069
-It's a chicken!
-It says "Follow me."

01:09.110 --> 01:11.071
Well, I guess that's
what we're supposed to do.

01:11.112 --> 01:14.657
My dad had this really cool
chicken named Barbecue.

01:14.699 --> 01:17.744
Maybe we're gonna
have to kill a chicken

01:17.786 --> 01:20.121
and then roast it up
and give it to them.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.957
-Oh, gosh!
-And I'm like...

01:26.294 --> 01:30.382
-Oh my God!
-A chicken coop!

01:30.423 --> 01:32.550
I see all these chickens,

01:32.592 --> 01:35.845
and that definitely brings me
back to that time in Mexico.

01:35.887 --> 01:39.474
My grandma used to have me get
the eggs from the chicken,

01:39.516 --> 01:41.393
and I got attacked
by a chicken.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.772
-It was not a good experience.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.816
-What?
-Oh, look, what does that--

01:47.857 --> 01:50.276
"Grab an egg
and head to the kitchen"?

01:50.318 --> 01:52.737
-Watch out, Delilah!

01:52.779 --> 01:55.448
Okay! Exciting.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.452
12 duos remain...

01:59.494 --> 02:01.830
-I can't reach!
-Voila!

02:01.871 --> 02:03.289
We killed it!

02:03.331 --> 02:06.334
At stake? $50,000,

02:06.376 --> 02:09.004
and the chance to be
crowned the champions

02:09.045 --> 02:11.006
of Top Chef Family Style.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.514
-Hi, chefs! Welcome.
-Morning!

02:19.556 --> 02:22.559
-Oh, my gosh, hi.
-Careful with those eggs, guys!

02:22.600 --> 02:25.478
Please meet
your guest judge for today.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.523
Groundbreaking chef,
restaurant owner,

02:28.565 --> 02:31.359
cookbook author:
Nancy Silverton.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.530
That's your number-one fan.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.700
Nancy Silverton is one of
the culinary legends

02:38.742 --> 02:40.785
that I have heard of
through my mom.

02:40.827 --> 02:44.122
The fact that she's gonna be
judging something that we make

02:44.164 --> 02:45.707
was just very exhilarating.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.917
What a pleasure
it is to be here.

02:47.959 --> 02:51.880
You know, I have judged several
episodes of Top Chef,

02:51.921 --> 02:54.716
so I'm excited to
taste your food

02:54.758 --> 02:57.510
and see you cooking
with your family.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.430
Well, it's time
to get cracking.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.645
For this Quickfire Challenge,

03:07.687 --> 03:11.107
we want you to put a new spin
on a classic dish...

03:11.149 --> 03:12.984
Eggs Benedict.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.070
I've never made that.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.616
The original
Eggs Benedict is classic.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.743
It's an egg and butter sauce.

03:21.785 --> 03:25.455
But what I'm asking you to do
is to personalize it.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.665
You will have one hour
to create

03:27.707 --> 03:29.626
your signature Eggs Benedict.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.921
But before you are
allowed in the pantry,

03:32.962 --> 03:36.800
you must present a perfectly
poached egg to Queen Nancy.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.968
Ooh.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.262
Raise your hand if you've
made a poached egg before.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.390
Yeah.

03:43.431 --> 03:45.100
...We're the only ones.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.602
Poaching an egg
is really challenging.

03:47.644 --> 03:51.481
Make sure you're very careful
when you crack that egg

03:51.523 --> 03:54.943
into that gently
simmering water.

03:54.984 --> 03:57.612
The white should be set,
but not rubbery.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.615
-And when you cut into it...
-Ooey-gooey.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.534
The yolk should ooze out

04:02.575 --> 04:06.329
and kind of match
the color of my outfit.

04:06.371 --> 04:10.959
You can only choose one chef
on your team to poach that egg.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.753
I'm gonna have to do this,

04:13.795 --> 04:16.047
because I poach eggs a lot
better than Kennedy does.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.758
She's done it less times
than I have, so--

04:18.800 --> 04:20.468
No, I've done it
more than you have.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.929
-No, you haven't.
-But mine are so good.

04:22.971 --> 04:26.641
If you get it right and
Nancy approves your egg,

04:26.683 --> 04:29.185
then you may start cooking
your Eggs Benedict.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.605
If not, you'll have to
start over from scratch.

04:32.647 --> 04:36.151
Today's Quickfire winners
will receive immunity...

04:36.192 --> 04:40.321
but the first six teams who get
Nancy's approval are

04:40.363 --> 04:42.949
the only ones who will be able
to cook their Eggs Benedict.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.326
-Oh, man.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.872
Chefs, please select one member
of your team to poach the egg.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.374
It's you.
I'm not poaching an egg.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.627
And have them step forward.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.963
I'm good at poaching eggs,
but I think Anika is

04:57.005 --> 04:59.674
better than me,
so Anika is the clear choice.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.843
I really want to be
one of those six.

05:01.885 --> 05:06.890
When the rooster crows, you may
start poaching your egg.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.687
That means your time
starts now!

05:12.729 --> 05:14.147
All right, Taylor.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.774
Let's get to poaching
some eggs, kid.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.609
You got it, you got it.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.572
I'm feeling intimidated,
because I'm not about

05:22.614 --> 05:24.699
to serve a bad poached egg
to Nancy Silverton.

05:24.741 --> 05:28.244
First, add some vinegar
to boiling water,

05:28.286 --> 05:31.081
and then slowly pour
an egg into the pot

05:31.122 --> 05:33.291
while stirring
the water continuously.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.294
When you take it
out of the water,

05:36.336 --> 05:38.672
you want it to feel
like a baby's bottom.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.131
That's not done yet.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.925
I was in the bottom
in the last elimination.

05:41.966 --> 05:44.552
I am determined
to give my A-game.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.554
Doing good, Delilah.
Don't get scrambled.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.139
What's the vinegar for?

05:48.181 --> 05:50.558
Sets the white
and helps it to encase.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.185
-Ahh.
-Is it boiling?

05:52.227 --> 05:54.145
-Oh, yeah.
-So close!

05:54.187 --> 05:57.732
-How's it working?
-It's pretty good.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.527
-It just broke!
-Ugh!

06:00.568 --> 06:02.612
The pot was sharp, okay?

06:02.654 --> 06:05.240
I've never heard of
a sharp pot.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.450
Come on, you got it.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.123
-Okay.
-What?

06:13.164 --> 06:14.749
Ooh, we got one!

06:14.791 --> 06:17.711
It's not--
it's not perfect, but--

06:17.752 --> 06:21.715
It is very close to perfect.
Definite thumbs-up.

06:21.756 --> 06:22.966
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

06:23.008 --> 06:26.011
-We got one egg!
-Can I go?

06:26.052 --> 06:28.638
-Go cook the Eggs Benedict.
-Thank you, thank you!

06:28.680 --> 06:30.598
-Can we start?
-Yeah!

06:30.640 --> 06:32.600
Come on!

06:32.642 --> 06:33.935
-Let's go!
-Oh, no!

06:33.977 --> 06:36.479
-No!
-I gotta get a new one.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.398
Number two.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.608
Your white has not completely
enveloped the yolk,

06:40.650 --> 06:42.902
-but you're very close!
-Okay, okay.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.654
I need to do it again.

06:44.696 --> 06:48.074
Ooh! This is crazy.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.702
Here comes Ocean!

06:50.744 --> 06:53.246
-You did it.
-We got two eggs!

06:53.288 --> 06:55.999
Let's keep it moving, guys.
We only have four spots left.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.043
When you see the person run up,
there's this really strong

06:58.084 --> 07:00.045
temptation to
pull your egg out.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.880
But if you pull your egg out
too early,

07:01.921 --> 07:03.506
you're gonna have
a runny white.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.216
-Here we go.
-Let's go, Taylor!

07:05.258 --> 07:06.968
Oh, Taylor!

07:07.010 --> 07:08.928
The white fell off of the yolk.

07:08.970 --> 07:12.265
-Quick, go back!
-Come on, guys!

07:12.307 --> 07:14.976
-Okay, Delilah!
-Oh, looking good.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.519
Delilah,
I think you're a winner.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.146
-Thank you!
-Oh, my goodness!

07:18.188 --> 07:19.647
Only three spots left.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.733
I think we've got
another winner in here.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.318
-Yep. Another winner.
-Thank you.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.486
Four...

07:24.527 --> 07:26.363
-Five.
-Five!

07:27.989 --> 07:30.575
Only one spot left.
Who's it gonna be?

07:30.617 --> 07:32.494
Okay, Kaj.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.165
-Six.
-We got six eggs!

07:37.207 --> 07:38.708
Oh, well.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.753
-Good luck, guys.
-Yeah, good luck.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.005
Okay, there's 55 minutes
on the clock.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.007
You guys can start
cooking your Eggs Benedict.

07:46.049 --> 07:49.844
Everyone else has to sit down
on these stools over here.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.181
If that first egg didn't break,
I would have gotten it.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.684
So since we live in Arizona
and we love chile,

07:55.725 --> 07:57.310
I say we do,
like, a chile theme.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.104
And, like, chorizos or meat.

07:59.145 --> 08:03.191
Chorizo was an easy choice,
with ancho chile adobo sauce.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.610
The only thing that could mess
us up is that our ancho chile

08:05.652 --> 08:08.321
could break the hollandaise
sauce, 'cause it's very oily.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.699
It's a risk, but we know
that's an important flavor

08:10.740 --> 08:12.742
-in the dish.
-Bringin' the heat.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.495
We got 50 minutes!

08:17.288 --> 08:18.748
He has a live lobster.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.625
Ocean,
what are you making today?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.711
Crab cake Benedict.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.254
The lobster,
is it part of the crab cake?

08:24.295 --> 08:26.006
So instead of
using a lot of egg,

08:26.047 --> 08:27.632
you beat lobster into a paste,

08:27.674 --> 08:29.467
and that binds
the crab cake together.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.885
Beautiful.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.846
I've tried
a lobster Benedict before.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.556
I really liked it.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.267
My dad really brought me into
the kitchen, because he is

08:37.308 --> 08:39.811
an executive chef at
one of the hotels in Hawaii.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.272
He always had the biggest
influence in my cooking.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.694
Hot water. You can't
just blend avocados, Dad.

08:47.736 --> 08:50.030
We make shakshuka all the time.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.449
Shakshuka is a northern
African, Mediterranean dish.

08:52.490 --> 08:55.201
We are replacing the bread
with, like, a potato cake,

08:55.243 --> 08:57.078
and then instead of
a hollandaise sauce,

08:57.120 --> 08:58.872
we're gonna do
an avocado sauce.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.915
-That looks really good.
-Put just a little bit more.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.168
Traditionally, that's not what
eggs Benedict is,

09:03.209 --> 09:06.046
but what I really want
to do is be original here.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.923
-Hey, what do you making?
-Shakshuka Benedict.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.842
-So are we!
-No, you're not!

09:10.884 --> 09:12.844
-We are indeed.
-No you're not!

09:12.886 --> 09:15.138
Kaj, we have
a shakshuka showdown!

09:15.180 --> 09:17.599
Do you guys have
a lot of experience

09:17.640 --> 09:19.434
cooking that type of dishes?

09:19.476 --> 09:22.062
I mean, I make shakshuka in
the restaurant I work at a lot.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.938
What restaurant do you work at?

09:23.980 --> 09:25.774
It's called Hippie Kitchen
in New Orleans.

09:25.815 --> 09:29.027
I've worked in a restaurant.
Not a lot of people really have

09:29.069 --> 09:31.780
that kind of
an insane opportunity.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.615
-I like the name.
-Thank you!

09:33.656 --> 09:35.450
It's a really cool experience,

09:35.492 --> 09:39.871
because my cooking style
now is very well-rounded.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.040
-That looks really good.
-Yeah.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.709
-Oh, are you putting ham--
-Yeah, I love Canadian bacon.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.294
You make that a lot?

09:46.336 --> 09:47.921
I make this biscuit
a decent amount.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.464
We're using my mom's
Korean biscuits

09:49.506 --> 09:51.174
instead of the classic
English muffin.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.093
Okay, we got this, Mama.
My mom's the person who

09:53.134 --> 09:55.637
taught me how to make the base
recipe, and she's the one

09:55.679 --> 09:57.305
-who makes it now.
-It's both of us.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.683
Milan sort of perfected the
biscuits in seventh grade

09:59.724 --> 10:01.643
as a part of a science project.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.812
-Okay.
-Yeah, this looks good.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.271
I tried a million
biscuit recipes,

10:05.313 --> 10:07.315
and that was
all I wanted to cook.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.983
These biscuits have
become a huge fan favorite.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.444
I think we got this.

10:11.486 --> 10:12.987
Let's go!

10:13.029 --> 10:16.199
The yolk just came out.
I-- this is trash.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.327
Delilah, what do you think of
having an al pastor rub

10:19.369 --> 10:20.870
on this pancetta?

10:20.912 --> 10:22.372
I think it's
a really good idea.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.833
I think it'll definitely
blow the judges away.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.334
14 minutes, Delilah.

10:26.376 --> 10:29.295
-All right.
-Swirl, swirl, swirl!

10:29.337 --> 10:31.631
We're just gonna
reheat this for a sec.

10:31.673 --> 10:32.716
Better?

10:32.757 --> 10:34.175
It broke a little bit.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.886
Of course,
the hollandaise sauce broke.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.556
Mix it a little bit.
Mix it fast.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.350
We add more water, it looked
great, and then it broke again.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.352
Let's take it over.
Let's start plating.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.687
Three minutes!

10:50.608 --> 10:54.446
We don't got much time,
I got to get that egg on here.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.989
Flip it, flip it!

10:56.031 --> 10:58.366
-It broke.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.617
Crap.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.296
Flip it, flip it.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.423
-It broke.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.258
I don't have time
to poach another egg.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.135
This is the worst thing
that could happen.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.387
Okay, I think I'm gonna
poke them all on one side.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.972
I'd rather have them
all look the same.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.391
-Careful.
-We're just gonna rename

11:23.433 --> 11:26.061
this dish, and we're gonna call
it a "broken egg Benedict."

11:26.102 --> 11:28.730
-30 seconds!
-Oh, my God!

11:30.398 --> 11:33.151
Three, two, one!

11:33.193 --> 11:34.778
Times up, hands up!

11:37.572 --> 11:38.782
Woo!

11:38.823 --> 11:41.451
-Hello!
-Hello, chefs.

11:41.493 --> 11:45.830
So we have a shakshuka with a
poached egg and a tahini sauce.

11:45.872 --> 11:49.000
-Your egg's done really well.
-Flavor is amazing.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.044
You know, shakshuka is
usually with a baked egg,

11:51.086 --> 11:53.296
so it's a very clever spin
on poaching the egg

11:53.338 --> 11:55.799
-and putting it on top.
-Thank you.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.592
Hello!

11:57.634 --> 11:59.469
This is our elevated
eggs Benedict.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.471
Rather than using
an English muffin,

12:01.513 --> 12:03.640
we made our own biscuit.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.100
We have a layer of pancetta.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.185
This is very, very classic.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.895
This is something
that we do at home.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.689
But it was definitely a risk.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.649
-So cool.
-Thank you.

12:12.691 --> 12:16.403
What we mean is kind of like
an al pastor eggs Benedict,

12:16.444 --> 12:20.490
and some crispy pancetta
with grilled pineapple.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.867
-There's pineapple!
-Wow, beautiful color.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.495
-Thank you.
-Hi, guys.

12:25.537 --> 12:28.164
We've got a shakshuka Benedict
with a potato cake

12:28.206 --> 12:30.000
and an avocado hollandaise.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.334
I love it.

12:31.376 --> 12:34.087
It has the mouthfeel
of a hollandaise.

12:34.129 --> 12:36.006
Thank you!

12:38.133 --> 12:40.760
We did a southwestern take
on eggs Benedict.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.096
Adobo and ancho chiles.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.098
-There's the spice.
-What made you think of it?

12:45.140 --> 12:47.267
We live in Arizona,
and we gotta represent.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.936
-Bring the heat.
-You sure did!

12:49.978 --> 12:51.479
Jaydene and Ocean.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.107
We need a seafood
broken eggs Benedict.

12:54.149 --> 12:57.027
Oh! I was gonna say,
your eggs Benedict broke.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.653
Was that intentional,

12:58.695 --> 13:01.156
or did they break and
did you rename the dish?

13:02.699 --> 13:04.200
...A little half and half.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.036
You know what?
Sometimes you got to do that.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.708
I have to tell you,
these dishes were impressive.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.461
There was not a loser
in the bunch.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.087
Woo, go us!

13:16.129 --> 13:17.881
Please tell them
who made our favorite dishes.

13:17.922 --> 13:22.469
Kiran and Moid, that avocado
hollandaise was genius.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.221
That texture
mimicked the texture

13:25.263 --> 13:27.557
-of a well-made hollandaise.
-Thank you!

13:27.599 --> 13:31.394
But Milan and Chandrani,
I was so impressed by

13:31.436 --> 13:34.397
the way you layered
every single component.

13:34.439 --> 13:37.942
It was absolutely
a restaurant-caliber dish.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.528
-Thank you.
-Ocean and Jaydene.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.448
I loved the crab cake as the
base,

13:43.490 --> 13:45.492
and I especially
loved the title.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.160
Thank you.

13:47.202 --> 13:50.413
The winner of the challenge
stayed really close

13:50.455 --> 13:52.999
to the classic,
but elevated it.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.835
It tasted the best.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.254
Milan and Chandrani.

13:58.296 --> 14:01.841
-We did it!

14:01.883 --> 14:03.426
Yay!

14:03.468 --> 14:05.387
This is gonna be so good
for your TikTok!

14:05.428 --> 14:07.430
It feels amazing
to win immunity.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.641
Tomorrow we can take
some risks,

14:09.683 --> 14:11.559
do something completely new
and different.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.521
-Thank you so much, Nancy!
-Thank you!

14:16.648 --> 14:19.442
Please welcome back my favorite
head judge, Marcus Samuelsson!

14:19.484 --> 14:22.821
-Come on out, buddy!

14:22.862 --> 14:25.198
-How you guys doing?
-Good.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.117
Now,
who here is ready for a treat?

14:27.158 --> 14:30.954
-Ooh!
-Yeah.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.872
Oh my God.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.336
Thank you, waiters.

14:38.378 --> 14:42.465
Chefs,
today you hit culinary jackpot.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.259
There's nothing better
than treating yourselves

14:44.300 --> 14:46.845
to the best. Personally,
I love treating myself.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.139
I also wrote an album
called Treat Myself

14:49.180 --> 14:51.641
that's out everywhere.
Check it out!

14:57.522 --> 14:59.441
For your Elimination Challenge,

14:59.482 --> 15:02.652
you'll be catering
a very exclusive VIP party.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.906
Your job is to create
the most luxurious dish

15:06.948 --> 15:08.575
you could dream of,

15:08.616 --> 15:11.327
highlighting at least one
of these amazing ingredients.

15:11.369 --> 15:15.331
You are gonna get to pick from
Royal Ossetra caviar,

15:15.373 --> 15:17.792
Sicilian pistachios,
Kobe beef...

15:17.834 --> 15:20.462
-I'm eating that one.
-Manuka honey,

15:20.503 --> 15:23.173
jamón ibérico, truffles...

15:23.214 --> 15:24.424
Oh, I don't like truffles.

15:24.466 --> 15:26.176
-Heritage pork...
-Yeah!

15:26.217 --> 15:30.513
-live sea urchin...
-I love sea urchin.

15:30.555 --> 15:33.475
-It is literally my favorite.
-She's been feeding it to me

15:33.516 --> 15:36.478
forever, and I've always wanted
to cook with it.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.189
And my favorite, spot prawns
from Santa Barbara.

15:39.230 --> 15:42.776
I've seen these ingredients
on TV, but it's not something

15:42.817 --> 15:44.986
where I'm just like,
"All right, Dad, I'mma go get

15:45.028 --> 15:47.655
"some Kobe beef and truffles.
I'll see you in a bit."

15:49.449 --> 15:51.493
Joining us tomorrow night
as our guest judges

15:51.534 --> 15:56.081
are none other than two-star
Michelin chef Josiah Citrin,

15:56.122 --> 15:59.709
and actor and cookbook author
Jesse Tyler Ferguson.

16:02.504 --> 16:06.383
Also on our guest list are
12 VIPs from the LA food scene.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.385
They're incredible ingredients.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.345
There's also delicate
textures here, right?

16:10.387 --> 16:13.765
So respect the ingredients,
and...

16:13.807 --> 16:16.893
-cook your socks off.
-All right, let's get planning.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.729
You got a big day tomorrow.
I'll see you then.

16:19.771 --> 16:23.566
-I'm gonna eat sea urchins!

16:23.608 --> 16:25.235
Book.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.237
I think we should try to
use truffle

16:27.278 --> 16:29.406
in every element of the dish.

16:29.447 --> 16:32.867
Last week you were
called out on your sauces.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.245
I think you need to
redeem yourself on this one.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.414
We learned to not experiment.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.916
We need to stick to
what we know.

16:39.958 --> 16:43.169
I say we do romesco sauce
with sea bass.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.463
Knowing that there's 17 people,

16:45.505 --> 16:47.882
what do you think we could
work with to get that done?

16:47.924 --> 16:50.802
-The bougie prosciutto.
-Okay.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.182
One of my greatest foods
I've ever eaten

16:56.224 --> 16:58.518
was in Japan, eating Kobe beef.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.687
I was thinking of doing
something with Kobe beef.

17:00.729 --> 17:03.648
Then I think we should marinate
it in my special sauce.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.442
I really want to
do my secret sauce.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.027
I've been working on it
for years.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.946
I also made this sauce
for a school fundraiser,

17:09.988 --> 17:11.614
and I raised $1000.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.450
So this sauce brings back
really good memories.

17:13.491 --> 17:17.746
I was thinking of making
the Cajun sauce,

17:17.787 --> 17:20.957
and then we blend
the lobster into that.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.126
Blend the lobster in the sauce?

17:23.168 --> 17:24.669
Yes.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.130
We're thinking of making
a spot prawn seafood boil.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.716
We're making our
own seafood stock,

17:29.758 --> 17:32.469
and that takes
quite a while, so...

17:32.510 --> 17:34.596
I feel like there's
a lot of room for error.

17:34.637 --> 17:38.683
I'm just trying to figure out
how we're gonna make all this,

17:38.725 --> 17:43.146
especially making 17 plates,
and we only have--

17:43.188 --> 17:45.023
-It's not 17.
-17.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.483
-It's 12.
-17.

17:46.524 --> 17:49.944
Been a long, hard day.
-We did good, Mom.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.039
Let's go!

18:05.210 --> 18:07.170
I can't reach!

18:07.212 --> 18:10.507
-We need a dozen eggs.
-Okay.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.009
Oh, my gosh,
that's a lot of tomatoes.

18:13.051 --> 18:17.681
Our elimination challenge is to
create the most luxurious dish.

18:17.722 --> 18:21.518
Truffle oil, truffle oil.
Mom, do we want more truffle?

18:21.559 --> 18:24.562
I love truffle, but I've
never worked with it before.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.564
We're making
a truffle tomato soup

18:26.606 --> 18:28.608
and truffle grilled cheese.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.735
-So an elevated grilled cheese.
-Exactly.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.530
They're kind of like
an earthy flavor.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.865
I'm really excited
to work with truffles.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.992
I've almost been waiting
my whole life.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.080
You know you pull that to
adjust how thin you want it?

18:42.122 --> 18:44.082
Yes. Easier said than done.

18:44.124 --> 18:47.419
We're making a pistachio lemon
biscotti with a lemon mousse.

18:47.460 --> 18:51.923
Right. I have been making
this recipe for 30 years.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.759
The feeling of just
staying safe... is good.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.636
How long should
I toast them for?

18:56.678 --> 18:58.888
-Five minutes.
-Five minutes.

18:58.930 --> 19:02.434
We're using that salmonella--

19:02.475 --> 19:05.812
"Sicilian." Not "salmonella."

19:05.854 --> 19:08.898
Here. Can you do this part?

19:08.940 --> 19:10.942
So tell me, what are
you guys doing on that?

19:10.984 --> 19:13.903
Crab boil and
a crispy prawn on top.

19:13.945 --> 19:17.782
Every weekend my family
go out to eat seafood boil.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.201
-Enough for everybody.

19:20.243 --> 19:23.830
As a family, we enjoy getting
messy, but we decided to

19:23.872 --> 19:27.459
elevate it where you could
eat it in a clean way.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.128
-Are you gonna use these?
-Yeah, over here!

19:30.170 --> 19:31.963
Sorry.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.966
-Oh, my God. They're live!
-The prawns are alive?

19:35.008 --> 19:36.801
Yeah,
they're jumping up and down.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.845
We never make
luxurious dishes, you know?

19:38.887 --> 19:41.806
We're at-home cooks. But we
always make a lot of shrimp.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.059
Those are not the same
as spotted prawns,

19:44.100 --> 19:46.478
but I know they taste
very similar.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.146
That's definitely
gonna be a challenge.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.814
Yes.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.861
We're doing, like,
honey-glazed carrots

19:54.903 --> 19:57.155
and then
pistachio-crusted salmon.

19:57.197 --> 20:00.075
-These are very small carrots.
-Since it's not as big

20:00.116 --> 20:02.869
-as you thought--
-It takes less time to cook.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.829
Cooking is what I love to do.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.165
Once I graduate high school,
I want to own a food truck.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.626
At such a young age,
she knew what she wanted to do.

20:09.668 --> 20:11.961
She loves pots and pans
and knives.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.506
That means Christmas
shopping way easier.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.925
-I wanna cut a diamond shape.
-Okay.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.511
I'm gonna cut up
the garlic, okay?

20:19.552 --> 20:21.846
'Cause you added the rice.
And butter.

20:21.888 --> 20:26.017
Making risotto in this big
of a portion is really risky.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.186
-Did you add butter to it?
-To that?

20:28.228 --> 20:32.023
If it overcooks, not a good
texture that you want to eat.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.109
I need to add the sake
before the garlic.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.276
No, not yet.

20:35.318 --> 20:36.695
Listen, we're New Yorkers.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.822
We're a loud,
crazy bunch of people.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.282
-Onion, scallion.
-That's what's in here!

20:41.324 --> 20:43.743
I have a voice projector.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.578
Sometimes the others chefs land

20:45.620 --> 20:47.831
in the middle of
the firing squad.

20:47.872 --> 20:50.291
Onion, garlic.

20:50.333 --> 20:53.545
I know they love each other,
but they are very aggressive.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.046
It's honestly
quite entertaining.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.048
They should have their own
reality TV show.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.175
While you're talking, you
should be cutting the garlic.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.345
One hour!

21:07.892 --> 21:09.728
Open that up,
and we got to taste it.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.731
It's oily, so we may not
need oil the fish.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.733
We've never worked with
jamonbefore.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.401
It's a very luxurious
ingredient.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.987
We don't know how it cooks
or what to do with it.

21:19.029 --> 21:22.198
-Okay. Is it too salty?
-Nutty. Very nutty.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.908
I have had prosciutto,

21:23.950 --> 21:26.703
and I know that goes
good with sea bass.

21:26.745 --> 21:28.413
They play hand in hand.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.248
A round of applause, you know?

21:30.290 --> 21:32.334
All right, I'm gonna put
these in the oven, Kaj.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.337
The first time,
we made French food.

21:35.378 --> 21:36.755
Then we made Burmese food,

21:36.796 --> 21:38.423
then we went to
the Mediterranean.

21:38.465 --> 21:41.426
I really like to cook all
different types of cuisine.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.553
It's really important
to us that we, like, travel

21:43.595 --> 21:45.180
and we see how people cook.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.515
-Are we going to Japan?
-I think this is Japanese.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.100
Dad doesn't want to do sushi.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.770
Sushi is, like,
really hard to execute.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.440
So we decided on fried
rice cake as the base

21:55.482 --> 21:57.150
and the Kobe beef
on top of that

21:57.192 --> 21:59.277
and we're gonna top it with
some fried kimchi

21:59.319 --> 22:01.821
to make it more like
a deconstructed sushi.

22:01.863 --> 22:04.282
We really want to
show our range,

22:04.324 --> 22:06.785
but also stay in our hearts.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.536
...That's so sweet. Oh, my God.

22:08.578 --> 22:10.330
I'm gonna put that
in my college essay.

22:10.372 --> 22:14.334
I have never actually
shaved a truffle. Have you?

22:14.376 --> 22:17.295
Fresh truffles have
an intoxicating aroma.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.005
Yeah, that's good.

22:19.047 --> 22:21.716
But they're very
difficult to use

22:21.758 --> 22:23.468
because they don't have
a strong flavor.

22:23.510 --> 22:26.179
I'm gonna make you a truffle
butter to sear a scallop in.

22:26.221 --> 22:27.806
Kaj, I'm happy to say
I'm gonna be

22:27.847 --> 22:29.474
the first two-time
challenge winner.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.976
-Oh, is that a fact?
-Yeah, it's gonna happen today.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.104
-Really? Good luck.
-Thank you.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.689
I don't really need it, though.

22:36.690 --> 22:40.443
We're worried that the tomato
is too acidic for the truffle,

22:40.485 --> 22:43.154
so we're making sure to put
truffle on everything we have.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.990
We're gonna put truffle
into the soup itself.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.951
Soak it in the truffle.

22:47.992 --> 22:50.745
Shave truffle on top, and then
grilled cheese with truffle,

22:50.787 --> 22:53.164
and then truffle oil
on that too.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.916
30 minutes!

22:56.001 --> 22:58.253
That needs
a little bit of acid.

23:01.548 --> 23:04.592
Wow, it's so pretty!

23:04.634 --> 23:06.177
Good evening, everyone.

23:06.219 --> 23:08.930
You're all looking
so fancy and gorgeous!

23:08.972 --> 23:11.933
Jesse and Josiah, thank you
so much for joining us.

23:11.975 --> 23:13.852
This is an intimidating
group of people,

23:13.893 --> 23:16.563
and to come out here trying
things for the first time

23:16.604 --> 23:18.690
shows how brave these kids are.

23:18.732 --> 23:20.525
-Yeah.
-Marcus, what's gonna be

23:20.567 --> 23:22.068
the hardest part
for them today?

23:22.110 --> 23:24.612
It's really about
highlighting these ingredients

23:24.654 --> 23:26.865
and understanding
these ingredients.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.658
I didn't know what
sea urchin was at 12!

23:30.493 --> 23:32.078
Three minutes, three minutes.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.289
I hope the pasta
doesn't have too much salt.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.374
We've got to get that
hollandaise on right now.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.835
In a minute.
The uni has to go on top first.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.837
I know. We got to get
this hollandaise on, though.

23:40.879 --> 23:42.881
This quail egg hollandaise
is very important

23:42.922 --> 23:46.217
because it adds sweetness
to the smoke of the uni.

23:46.259 --> 23:49.679
Mom, Mom, Mom!
Wipe that plate up.

23:49.721 --> 23:51.139
The hollandaise
isn't gonna make it.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.891
-Yes it is.
-No, it's not.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.226
Where is it?
Where is it? Where is it?

24:01.775 --> 24:03.443
-Yes, it is.
-Where is it?

24:03.485 --> 24:07.072
-Mom, Mom, wipe that plate up.
-Hurry, hurry. I got it.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.157
Do you think I should
put more sauce on the top?

24:09.199 --> 24:11.868
-That's good.
-Hurry.

24:14.746 --> 24:17.624
Oh, man!

24:17.665 --> 24:19.542
I'm the cook in my family.

24:19.584 --> 24:21.628
My son is less than a year old.

24:21.670 --> 24:23.421
My husband doesn't
even know where the stove is.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.131
So, I'm really
excited to just like sit back

24:25.173 --> 24:26.675
and let someone
else cook for me.

24:31.221 --> 24:34.641
Pretty. I mean,
this looks so fancy.

24:34.683 --> 24:35.850
Yeah, it's very nice
presentation.

24:35.892 --> 24:37.519
That's gotta be the urchin.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.897
-Meghan found the urchin!
-This is my first time.

24:40.939 --> 24:43.733
-Hi, Kennedy and Rosie.
-Hey!

24:43.775 --> 24:46.653
So, we did the pistachio
salmon and honey glazed carrots

24:46.695 --> 24:48.321
with garlic mashed potatoes.

24:48.363 --> 24:49.948
What was the hardest
thing to cook Kennedy?

24:49.989 --> 24:51.991
It was just the time pressure.

24:52.033 --> 24:53.993
This was
probably the hardest round.

24:54.035 --> 24:56.663
Hi, Eva and Jenn. You want
to tell us about your dish?

24:56.705 --> 24:59.749
We made a creamy
sea urchin risotto

24:59.791 --> 25:05.505
with a quail egg hollandaise,
balsamic reduction with caviar.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.007
Amazing.

25:07.048 --> 25:08.591
Eva, how do you
feel about the round?

25:08.633 --> 25:10.301
We just feel really
confident in our dish.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.345
-Good for you.
-Thank you.

25:12.387 --> 25:13.888
Anika and Anu!

25:13.930 --> 25:17.142
We made prawn
scampi with homemade pasta

25:17.183 --> 25:19.185
and crunchy
gremolata bread crumbs.

25:19.227 --> 25:20.979
Have you made
angel hair before?

25:21.021 --> 25:23.064
Yes, but I learned
it's very hard to make it

25:23.106 --> 25:24.566
for like so many people.

25:24.607 --> 25:26.776
So I think we took
a little bit of a risk.

25:26.818 --> 25:28.486
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

25:28.528 --> 25:31.573
Anika and Anu's dish
was very sophisticated.

25:31.614 --> 25:33.783
Everything on this place,
they made themselves.

25:33.825 --> 25:36.536
Prawns are very
easy to get wrong.

25:36.578 --> 25:38.204
It can become very rubbery.

25:38.246 --> 25:39.706
And this was perfectly done.

25:39.748 --> 25:41.291
And the pasta's well prepared.

25:41.332 --> 25:43.376
A little bit,
a little heat, a spice to it.

25:43.418 --> 25:44.919
Prawns are
the most important part.

25:44.961 --> 25:48.131
So that is very,
a little bit worrying.

25:48.173 --> 25:50.050
And what do we think about
Kennedy and Rosie's salmon?

25:50.091 --> 25:53.178
Didn't shy away from
the high end ingredient.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.888
They actually highlight
the pistachio

25:54.929 --> 25:56.598
and that beautiful honey.

25:56.639 --> 25:58.224
The salmon, perfectly cooked.

25:58.266 --> 25:59.976
I do find the pistachio
encrusted things

26:00.018 --> 26:02.395
to be a little 1980s,
which is interesting

26:02.437 --> 26:04.397
because Kennedy was
not alive at that point.

26:04.439 --> 26:05.899
No, she was not.

26:05.940 --> 26:08.485
Between one to 10,
what would you say we did?

26:08.526 --> 26:09.736
Eight.

26:09.778 --> 26:11.529
Even Jenn's beautiful risotto.

26:11.571 --> 26:14.324
The rice is overcooked,
but it's definitely something

26:14.366 --> 26:16.076
you would get in that
Michelin star restaurant.

26:16.117 --> 26:18.244
Execution is not perfect,
but I love these flavors.

26:18.286 --> 26:20.914
I would put this on
a tasting menu any time.

26:20.955 --> 26:23.041
I want to hear
what your thoughts are

26:23.083 --> 26:24.834
since this is your
first time with urchin.

26:24.876 --> 26:26.586
-This was yummy.
-Yay!

26:26.628 --> 26:28.922
The aftertaste was like,
"Oh, I'm swimming in the sea."

26:28.963 --> 26:30.465
I think the flavors
were really great.

26:30.507 --> 26:33.218
-It was really delicious.
-I think we nailed it.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.345
Josiah, how old were
you when you started to cook?

26:35.387 --> 26:36.763
I was about 12.

26:36.805 --> 26:39.265
Peeling some carrots
for extra money to go surfing.

26:39.307 --> 26:41.267
When I was that age,
I was only eating things

26:41.309 --> 26:44.229
about orange or beige.
It was just a thing I had.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.773
Yeah, yeah! No judging,
no judging over here.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.817
We have five minutes.

26:48.858 --> 26:50.485
Romesco is perfect.

26:50.527 --> 26:52.904
I don't know what's wrong
with this, but it's not good.

26:52.946 --> 26:56.157
My secret sauce, the base is
always soy sauce and sriracha.

26:56.199 --> 26:58.910
I think it just
needs more ketchup.

26:58.952 --> 27:00.453
But I added
a little bit more sriracha.

27:00.495 --> 27:02.288
I want like
a flavor punch in your mouth.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.624
And then we have to
put the lemon zest on top.

27:04.666 --> 27:07.252
-We just don't want it to melt.
-A minute!

27:07.293 --> 27:08.837
-Put the cilantro on.
-I'm shaking.

27:08.878 --> 27:10.672
You're gonna
come in with the sauce?

27:12.674 --> 27:14.300
I feel good.

27:16.344 --> 27:17.762
Yeah.

27:19.931 --> 27:22.142
-Wow.
-They're killing it.

27:22.183 --> 27:24.686
Kiran and Moid, you want
to tell us about your dish?

27:24.728 --> 27:27.188
I have Kobe beef sushi bite.

27:27.230 --> 27:29.315
So it's a fried rice cake with
fried kimchi

27:29.357 --> 27:31.526
-and my secret sauce.
-How did you make the rice?

27:31.568 --> 27:34.279
We made sushi rice, cut it
and then we fried it in a pan.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.655
Feel good about this round?

27:35.697 --> 27:37.741
Yeah...ish.

27:37.782 --> 27:40.326
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

27:40.368 --> 27:44.330
Oh, he confident.

27:44.372 --> 27:47.250
Our luxury ingredient
was jamon de bellota.

27:47.292 --> 27:50.503
So the main part
is jamonwrapped sea bass.

27:50.545 --> 27:52.422
And then we had caviar on top,
some arugula

27:52.464 --> 27:56.885
and we had a jamonromesco
sauce. Thank you.

27:56.926 --> 27:59.721
Hi, Brooke and Carol.

27:59.763 --> 28:03.683
We made a chilled lemon
mousse with candied pistachios

28:03.725 --> 28:06.019
and a pistachio biscotti.

28:06.061 --> 28:07.645
You're the only
one who made dessert.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.856
I wanted to stand
out from everyone else.

28:09.898 --> 28:12.525
Thank you so much. Enjoy it.

28:12.567 --> 28:14.778
So, what do we think of Brooke
and Carol's lemon tart?

28:14.819 --> 28:18.656
I find biscotti really
hard to make. I overcook mine.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.700
I love that there's
a chewiness to this one.

28:20.742 --> 28:23.411
And I was like, this better be
the best cookie of all times.

28:23.453 --> 28:26.039
And it was! It was so good!

28:26.081 --> 28:28.166
I thought Jack and Bobbie's
jamonwrapped sea bass

28:28.208 --> 28:30.043
was cooked perfectly.

28:30.085 --> 28:32.045
The jamon serrano, the way
they wrapped around the fish,

28:32.087 --> 28:33.713
brought
a really nice salt flavor.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.757
To be that young
and to understand that.

28:35.799 --> 28:37.384
Like so focused.

28:37.425 --> 28:39.094
It's really, really genius.

28:40.929 --> 28:42.555
Kiran and Moid's dish.

28:42.597 --> 28:46.309
I thought the rice was so
crunchy, but not in a good way.

28:46.351 --> 28:48.728
That sriracha doesn't
belong on the Kobe beef

28:48.770 --> 28:51.856
because everything you
taste is that hot sauce.

28:51.898 --> 28:53.566
Just trust the Kobe beef.

28:53.608 --> 28:55.902
It's going to give
all the richness you want.

28:55.944 --> 28:59.656
We got stressed with
each other but that's okay.

28:59.698 --> 29:01.408
Still looks good.

29:01.449 --> 29:03.410
Okay, I got some trouble
pieces to put on the top.

29:03.451 --> 29:05.495
I'm worried our
dish is too simple,

29:05.537 --> 29:07.997
that we're not highlighting
the truffle enough.

29:08.039 --> 29:09.791
-We need to hurry.
-Yes, we do.

29:09.833 --> 29:12.419
Let me do the microgreens.
You're too much of

29:12.460 --> 29:14.254
-a heavy hand.
-Heavy? I can do this too.

29:14.295 --> 29:16.631
-Should we add more truffles?
-I leave it up to you.

29:16.673 --> 29:18.967
I like truffle salt.

29:25.432 --> 29:27.517
So, wow this tomato soup.

29:27.559 --> 29:29.019
That's a very pretty
tomato soup.

29:29.060 --> 29:31.229
Mmm. Elegant.

29:31.271 --> 29:34.733
Oh, I love truffle.
Taylor and Elizabeth.

29:34.774 --> 29:38.945
We made
a truffle-ific tomato soup

29:38.987 --> 29:42.699
and then like a tiny little
grilled cheese with truffle oil

29:42.741 --> 29:44.284
and truffle salt on it.

29:44.325 --> 29:47.454
And then a basil sauce
blended in some truffle.

29:47.495 --> 29:49.706
So you went full
on with the truffle?

29:49.748 --> 29:51.583
Yeah, it's
the only mushroom I like.

29:51.624 --> 29:53.043
The only mushroom.

29:53.084 --> 29:54.210
You are very high end.

29:54.252 --> 29:56.671
Thank you so much.

29:58.131 --> 29:59.841
Hi, Ocean and Jaydene.

29:59.883 --> 30:03.053
Hi. We made for you
guys an uniSandwich.

30:03.094 --> 30:05.889
We have our buttered
sour dough bread, unipoke,

30:05.930 --> 30:09.684
cubed ahi with a little
bit of unimayo and lemon zest.

30:09.726 --> 30:14.230
Thank you. Kaj and Liz.

30:14.272 --> 30:17.275
We made a mushroom
risotto with truffle cream,

30:17.317 --> 30:19.569
seared scallop
cooked in a truffle butter

30:19.611 --> 30:21.529
with a Parmesan
and truffle crisp.

30:21.571 --> 30:22.864
Thank you.

30:22.906 --> 30:25.116
Okay, so Taylor
and Elizabeth call this

30:25.158 --> 30:26.826
truffle-licious soup.

30:26.868 --> 30:29.496
You guys, is it crazy
that I can't taste the truffle

30:29.537 --> 30:31.998
after I was explaining
that it's everywhere.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.667
I was just
a little disappointed

30:33.708 --> 30:35.502
that it wasn't
a little more truffle-y.

30:35.543 --> 30:37.796
And that's an adjective
you all can use. Truffle-y.

30:37.837 --> 30:40.298
Tomatoes are a really hard
flavor to put truffles into.

30:40.340 --> 30:42.425
It's already
a very strong flavor.

30:42.467 --> 30:45.637
You can add a kilo of truffles
in here. It wouldn't change.

30:45.679 --> 30:47.847
-I am really proud of you.
-Thank you.

30:47.889 --> 30:50.850
Ocean and Jaydene's
dish lives up to Ocean's name.

30:50.892 --> 30:52.602
That urchin on the top.

30:52.644 --> 30:55.605
I took it as a whole
piece and it's very ocean-y.

30:55.647 --> 30:59.526
I took the whole
sea urchin in my mouth.

30:59.567 --> 31:02.112
That sea urchin tongue on top,
it's just over the top.

31:02.153 --> 31:05.073
-It's just off on balance.
-Let's go.

31:05.115 --> 31:08.159
Let's talk about
Kaj and Liz' risotto.

31:08.201 --> 31:09.911
He did a nice job searing it.

31:09.953 --> 31:12.330
The rice is so well cooked.
A lot of truffle umami.

31:12.372 --> 31:13.790
I love the crisp of Parmesan.

31:13.832 --> 31:15.709
Just give that
little bit of salt.

31:15.750 --> 31:18.712
Can definitely be part of
a high and fine dining tasting.

31:18.753 --> 31:20.505
The scallop risotto.

31:20.547 --> 31:22.257
Oh, yeah. That was amazing.

31:22.298 --> 31:24.300
I'm going to believe
that we had our comeback.

31:24.342 --> 31:25.885
Ten more minutes!

31:25.927 --> 31:27.971
Oh my god, that was alive.

31:28.013 --> 31:31.349
Our plan for the crispy fried
prawns is to peel the body part

31:31.391 --> 31:33.143
and tempura
those with the head on

31:33.184 --> 31:34.811
because a head
has the most flavor.

31:34.853 --> 31:37.731
-I'm going to fry them, Danny.
-Three minutes.

31:37.772 --> 31:39.733
Oh, my God. You
should start the blow torch.

31:41.609 --> 31:43.903
It's so tender.
It's falling apart!

31:43.945 --> 31:47.115
Some real decadence here.

31:47.157 --> 31:49.743
Oh yeah, we need sauce.

31:51.411 --> 31:52.454
It's fine, Danny.

31:52.495 --> 31:53.997
No, let's do it again.

31:54.039 --> 31:57.042
We can't do it again,
we have a minute left.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.251
Oh my god.

32:04.924 --> 32:07.093
-Save the potatoes.
-I'm trying to.

32:10.180 --> 32:13.391
Okay, okay!

32:15.352 --> 32:17.812
I feel so happy.

32:17.854 --> 32:18.980
Nice work.

32:24.694 --> 32:26.780
Khalil,
can you tell us we made?

32:26.821 --> 32:29.908
We made a seared fillet
with a truffle bordelaise,

32:29.949 --> 32:32.994
a fondant potato topped
with creme fresh and caviar.

32:33.036 --> 32:35.747
You're using all
the French words today, huh?

32:35.789 --> 32:37.332
Merci.

32:37.374 --> 32:39.626
Yeah.

32:39.668 --> 32:41.419
Hello, Milan and Chandrani.

32:41.461 --> 32:43.672
We made you Kobe two ways.

32:43.713 --> 32:46.633
We have a Kobe
sushi with a sea urchin

32:46.675 --> 32:49.135
and then we have a seared Kobe.

32:49.177 --> 32:51.680
And you sprinkled some gold
just because you're fabulous.

32:51.721 --> 32:53.890
I mean, if you've got
some gold, why not use it?

32:53.932 --> 32:57.018
Yeah. Have you ever
cooked sushi rice before?

32:57.060 --> 32:58.937
We've cooked sushi
a few times at home.

32:58.978 --> 33:01.022
Well, thank you so much.

33:01.064 --> 33:03.775
Hi, Delilah and Danny.

33:03.817 --> 33:05.944
What we cooked for
you today was our version

33:05.985 --> 33:11.074
of a seafood boil, so we
did a lobster and prawn bisque

33:11.116 --> 33:14.619
and sweet corn puree,
and potato scallop

33:14.661 --> 33:16.955
with a crispy prawn on top.

33:16.996 --> 33:21.167
Every weekend, me and my
family, we go eat this meal.

33:21.209 --> 33:22.877
I love that.

33:22.919 --> 33:24.713
Thank you.

33:24.754 --> 33:27.549
What do you
think about that prawn?

33:27.590 --> 33:29.509
Going for the head.

33:32.762 --> 33:35.223
You want to an eye,
I can give it to you.

33:35.265 --> 33:37.851
-That's okay.
-That's okay.

33:37.892 --> 33:40.395
Okay, let's talk about
Khalil and Willie's filet.

33:40.437 --> 33:42.397
I don't know how they got that
much flavor

33:42.439 --> 33:43.773
out this piece of meat.

33:43.815 --> 33:45.650
This dish is
like luxury high end.

33:45.692 --> 33:47.902
Best use of caviar
so far today.

33:47.944 --> 33:49.571
That was
a pretty good last round.

33:49.612 --> 33:51.239
Yeah, that was good.

33:51.281 --> 33:53.616
Let's talk about Milan
and Chandrani's Kobe beef.

33:53.658 --> 33:56.161
Next to that beautifully
cooked piece of the beef,

33:56.202 --> 34:01.082
I found the sushi piece
to be a little challenging.

34:01.124 --> 34:03.335
It just didn't
sing in the same way.

34:03.376 --> 34:05.003
Fish is a trap.

34:05.045 --> 34:06.921
It's actually one of
the hardest things you can do.

34:06.963 --> 34:08.757
Plus, this dish
didn't have much to it at all.

34:08.798 --> 34:11.426
It didn't live up
to the gold standard.

34:11.468 --> 34:13.762
It's a good thing for them
that they cannot be eliminated.

34:13.803 --> 34:16.765
-It was a fancy room.
-Our dish is so good.

34:16.806 --> 34:18.808
Delilah and Danny's Cajun boil.

34:18.850 --> 34:20.685
The bisque
with the corn dollops

34:20.727 --> 34:22.896
-is really, really flavorful.
-It was perfectly cooked.

34:22.937 --> 34:24.898
Crab boil down below,
it's delicious.

34:24.939 --> 34:26.941
Little spicy and they
fry it with the head on.

34:26.983 --> 34:28.693
That's even harder.

34:28.735 --> 34:30.987
I'm eating a plate with
a head on it and I'm loving it.

34:31.029 --> 34:33.615
Okay, I didn't recognize
his name but then I was like,

34:33.656 --> 34:36.201
-"He's from Modern Family!"
-I'm just very impressed

34:36.242 --> 34:39.162
by the presentation,
the boldness of everything,

34:39.204 --> 34:41.790
I couldn't have done this
as a child and I still can't.

34:41.831 --> 34:45.126
This restaurant serves
18 courses, whatever it is,

34:45.168 --> 34:46.753
I'm coming back.

34:46.795 --> 34:48.588
It was
very impressive and inspiring.

34:48.630 --> 34:50.632
And I think I got
some new ideas out of here.

34:50.674 --> 34:53.051
-Yeah!
-I'm gonna go get the chefs

34:53.093 --> 34:55.136
and we'll meet you
at Judges' Table.

34:55.178 --> 34:56.471
Okay, let's do it.

34:56.513 --> 34:58.306
My jacket
literally doesn't button.

34:58.348 --> 35:01.142
Do y'all want to get
called up in that group of six?

35:01.184 --> 35:03.937
No, no.
I'd rather be in the middle

35:03.978 --> 35:06.398
than go to the Judges' Table
and stress out where I am.

35:06.439 --> 35:10.318
-Oh.
-Hi, chefs. All right.

35:10.360 --> 35:13.571
We would like to see the
following chefs at Judges'

35:13.613 --> 35:15.448
Kaj and Liz.

35:15.490 --> 35:17.200
Oh, my God.

35:17.242 --> 35:19.285
Why do you do that to me?

35:19.327 --> 35:20.453
Kiran and Moid.

35:20.495 --> 35:22.038
No, come on!

35:22.080 --> 35:26.167
If there was a graph
to show how I'm doing,

35:26.209 --> 35:30.130
it goes up, down, up, down.

35:30.171 --> 35:31.673
Milan and Chandrani.

35:31.715 --> 35:33.508
We're good.
We're good. We're good.

35:33.550 --> 35:36.344
Taylor and Elizabeth.
Jack and Bobby.

35:36.386 --> 35:39.931
Delilah and Danny, thank you.

35:39.973 --> 35:41.891
I think we might be in the top.

35:41.933 --> 35:44.310
Really? I think we
might be on the bottom.

35:44.352 --> 35:46.396
-You do?
-Yeah

35:46.438 --> 35:48.314
It's okay. Let's
go with the top. Okay.

35:48.356 --> 35:50.525
-Let's go with the top.
-Let's go with the top.

35:59.784 --> 36:03.371
Cooking with high-end
luxury ingredients

36:03.413 --> 36:05.331
can be very, very difficult.

36:05.373 --> 36:08.626
But you guys should be
really proud of yourself.

36:08.668 --> 36:10.962
We ate pretty well.

36:11.004 --> 36:14.966
Delilah and Danny,
Jack and Bobby,

36:15.008 --> 36:18.011
Kaj and Liz, please stay here.

36:18.053 --> 36:20.055
The rest of you
can step to the side.

36:24.934 --> 36:26.936
I think we're in the bottom.

36:26.978 --> 36:29.773
You chefs are
standing here because...

36:31.107 --> 36:34.277
You made our
favorite dishes of the night.

36:36.029 --> 36:37.989
Congratulations.

36:39.991 --> 36:42.911
Chef Jack, have you wrapped
a fish like that before?

36:42.952 --> 36:45.705
I've tried wrapping fish
and like other meats before,

36:45.747 --> 36:47.082
but never with the jamon.

36:47.123 --> 36:49.084
Very difficult
dish to do right.

36:49.125 --> 36:51.169
And you guys execute
it on a very high level.

36:51.211 --> 36:52.420
Thank you.

36:52.462 --> 36:54.297
The sauce
was incredibly delicious.

36:54.339 --> 36:56.758
The fish had a lot of umami.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.927
Delilah and Danny,
quite frankly,

36:58.968 --> 37:02.430
anyone who can get
Meghan to eat crispy prawn head

37:02.472 --> 37:04.057
is doing well.

37:04.099 --> 37:06.601
Yes, I went in so scared
and I came out so happy.

37:06.643 --> 37:08.311
Thank you. That means a lot.

37:08.353 --> 37:10.355
You ever worked with Santa
Barbara spot prawns before?

37:10.397 --> 37:12.232
We never worked with
that particular prawn before,

37:12.273 --> 37:13.817
but we love shrimp,

37:13.858 --> 37:15.819
so that's where
the inspiration came from.

37:15.860 --> 37:17.779
Very difficult to
cook the whole prawn right,

37:17.821 --> 37:19.406
where the tail
doesn't get mushy.

37:19.447 --> 37:21.783
So, I was very impressed
and it was all perfectly done.

37:21.825 --> 37:25.245
Kaj, the risotto.
You just crushed it.

37:25.286 --> 37:27.455
Keep cooking like that
and you're going to go far.

37:27.497 --> 37:28.957
Thank you.

37:28.998 --> 37:30.834
Scallops is one of
my favorite foods to eat.

37:30.875 --> 37:32.627
And it was just beautifully,
beautifully cooked.

37:32.669 --> 37:36.798
Jesse, you have the honor
of announcing the winner.

37:36.840 --> 37:39.009
The chefs who made
our favorite dish today

37:39.050 --> 37:42.512
really honored the ingredients
and really cooked from heart.

37:42.554 --> 37:44.597
The winning chefs are...

37:49.853 --> 37:51.187
Delilah and Danny.

37:53.982 --> 37:56.568
Oh my god, thank you!

37:56.609 --> 37:57.944
She's going to pass out.

37:57.986 --> 38:00.071
We won!

38:00.113 --> 38:02.824
It's just
an explosion of happiness.

38:02.866 --> 38:06.244
Thank you, guys. We
really did cook from the heart.

38:06.286 --> 38:08.621
I'm really happy that
we got to redeem ourselves.

38:08.663 --> 38:11.833
I think it takes
a lot of positive attitude

38:11.875 --> 38:14.169
to just keep pushing through.

38:14.210 --> 38:17.422
Good for you, Delilah.
Go and get it.

38:17.464 --> 38:20.967
Congratulations to all of you.
You can step to the side.

38:21.009 --> 38:23.678
Please, will the other teams,
step forward.

38:23.720 --> 38:26.723
Oh, no, Milan has immunity.

38:26.765 --> 38:28.224
So, it's between two people.

38:28.266 --> 38:30.518
You had our least
favorite dishes tonight.

38:30.560 --> 38:31.978
Sorry.

38:32.020 --> 38:33.730
And one
of you will be going home.

38:33.772 --> 38:35.523
-Good luck, you guys.
-No, my gosh.

38:42.530 --> 38:46.701
Milan, sushi didn't serve
itself well for you today.

38:46.743 --> 38:49.079
The rice has to be
cooked to perfection.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.206
I would never dare to do it.

38:51.247 --> 38:55.418
The seared Wagyu was actually
really delicious, but it really

38:55.460 --> 38:58.963
counterbalanced the less
successful raw element.

38:59.005 --> 39:00.757
You definitely have talent,

39:00.799 --> 39:02.342
and you're lucky
you have the immunity.

39:02.384 --> 39:04.761
So we get to see
what you do going forward.

39:04.803 --> 39:06.805
Kiran and Moid,
walk us through yours.

39:06.846 --> 39:10.308
Just skip us.
I don't need it. I'm good.

39:10.350 --> 39:12.769
It's okay.
Just tell us about your dish.

39:12.811 --> 39:16.022
I really don't know what to say
because I'm back in the bottom.

39:16.064 --> 39:19.984
-It doesn't feel great.
-But, Kiran, you got to listen.

39:20.026 --> 39:23.363
You seared the beef the best.

39:23.405 --> 39:25.824
But, you have
Kobe beef like that,

39:25.865 --> 39:28.410
to cover it with
a lot of sriracha,

39:28.451 --> 39:32.414
it's not respecting one of the
best ingredients in the world.

39:32.455 --> 39:35.083
That rice cake
was cooked too crispy.

39:35.125 --> 39:38.920
Obviously,
we didn't prepare well enough.

39:40.588 --> 39:43.842
Or I didn't prepare--
I was in charge of the rice.

39:43.883 --> 39:45.969
No, that's not
what I was saying.

39:46.011 --> 39:48.388
It's a good dish.
It's just not perfect.

39:48.430 --> 39:50.432
Every day is a learning
experience to get better.

39:50.473 --> 39:52.475
Always be open
to other experiences,

39:52.517 --> 39:55.353
it's going to make you
much more successful in life.

39:55.395 --> 39:57.355
Taylor and Elizabeth,
what were you hoping to do

39:57.397 --> 39:59.149
with your dish today?

39:59.190 --> 40:02.402
Well, we were kind of hoping
to maybe put us in the top,

40:02.444 --> 40:03.737
not the bottom.

40:05.363 --> 40:07.657
I love this.

40:07.699 --> 40:09.993
When you were describing
how much truffle was in it,

40:10.035 --> 40:12.078
I was really expecting
to get that hit of truffle.

40:12.120 --> 40:16.166
We had an uphill battle with
an acidic food like tomato.

40:16.207 --> 40:19.127
Tomato and truffle
kind of go against each other.

40:19.169 --> 40:21.796
The tomato is tangy in flavor.

40:21.838 --> 40:23.381
The truffle, earthy.

40:23.423 --> 40:26.176
We thought if we
could infuse enough truffle

40:26.217 --> 40:29.304
into enough things, you
all would be able to taste it.

40:29.346 --> 40:31.681
Soup and truffle
is a great combination.

40:31.723 --> 40:33.016
But you're right,
it's very hard

40:33.058 --> 40:34.851
to make tomato
and truffle work.

40:34.893 --> 40:38.063
Thank you, chefs.
We have a lot to discuss.

40:38.104 --> 40:40.523
Please head back
to the rec room

40:40.565 --> 40:42.525
and we'll call
you when we're ready.

40:42.567 --> 40:45.862
I'm going home. I'm going home.
There's no question about it.

40:48.740 --> 40:50.200
Hello. We're back.

40:50.241 --> 40:52.118
-What happened?
-How'd it go?

40:52.160 --> 40:54.162
-We're on the bottom.
-We're on the bottom.

40:54.204 --> 40:55.830
Delilah and Danny won.

40:57.707 --> 40:59.834
-Thank you, guys.
-Champions!

40:59.876 --> 41:01.711
So, who's in the bottom?
Kiran and Taylor?

41:01.753 --> 41:05.548
And Milan, but he has immunity,
so, it's between us two.

41:05.590 --> 41:08.218
Milan made the worst dish.
So, I'm so upset.

41:08.259 --> 41:11.554
Concept-wise, I felt
like Taylor and Elizabeth,

41:11.596 --> 41:13.098
that was really smart play.

41:13.139 --> 41:16.476
But the tomato
truffle just didn't work out.

41:16.518 --> 41:19.104
That was what was
a real disappointment for me.

41:19.145 --> 41:20.647
It was really sold to us,

41:20.689 --> 41:23.024
truffle here, a truffle here,
truffle there.

41:23.066 --> 41:24.609
We have to be able to taste it.

41:24.651 --> 41:27.529
I have a bad feeling
that we're going home.

41:27.570 --> 41:29.906
Taylor, I'm telling you,
it's going to be us.

41:29.948 --> 41:31.574
You're good.

41:31.616 --> 41:35.662
Kiran and Moid's dish, I loved
how they seared the beef.

41:35.704 --> 41:39.332
And then the first
thing we got was the sriracha.

41:39.374 --> 41:42.168
And then the rice cake was
so overcooked on the outside.

41:42.210 --> 41:44.254
At least
the beef was very present.

41:44.295 --> 41:47.549
Yeah. And with the truffle,
it just was missing.

41:47.590 --> 41:49.384
This is a really tough one.

41:49.426 --> 41:52.846
They're definitely nitpicking
because my dish was amazing.

41:52.887 --> 41:54.264
Let's bring them back in.

42:06.359 --> 42:09.612
It's very rare at the starting
point of a chef's life

42:09.654 --> 42:14.242
to cook with these
incredible ingredients.

42:14.284 --> 42:16.578
It takes years of understanding

42:16.619 --> 42:20.206
how these ingredients
actually play off one another.

42:20.248 --> 42:22.834
Today's
challenge really came down

42:22.876 --> 42:26.463
to the execution of the dishes.

42:26.504 --> 42:30.884
The chefs that
will be leaving us are...

42:33.219 --> 42:37.140
Taylor and Elizabeth.
Please pack your knives and go.

42:38.683 --> 42:40.810
Thanks for the opportunity.

42:40.852 --> 42:42.228
Thank you.

42:42.270 --> 42:43.980
So proud of you, Taylor!
You're amazing!

42:46.358 --> 42:51.154
-You're so awesome.
-Thank you.

42:51.196 --> 42:55.033
-She was surprised.
-She was shocked.

42:55.075 --> 42:57.452
Taylor and I are headed home.

42:57.494 --> 42:58.828
Aw!

42:58.870 --> 43:01.164
I'm really proud of myself

43:01.206 --> 43:03.583
because Top Chef has
really been awesome opportunity

43:03.625 --> 43:07.629
to be better at cooking
and accomplish my dreams.

43:07.671 --> 43:10.173
-Keep cooking, bro.
-Keep cooking!

43:10.215 --> 43:12.175
I'll miss
the friends that we made.

43:12.217 --> 43:16.096
I'll also miss, like the fryer
and everything like that.

43:16.137 --> 43:18.264
Friends and the fryer.

43:18.306 --> 43:22.102
I'm so proud of Taylor,
if he can do this at nine,

43:22.143 --> 43:24.938
I can't imagine what
he'll do when he's an adult.

43:32.070 --> 43:35.156
Next on
Top Chef Family Style...

43:35.198 --> 43:36.700
You guys
ready for some football?

43:39.577 --> 43:43.873
Today, your task will
be feeding all of these guys.

43:43.915 --> 43:45.583
Oh, Lord.

43:45.625 --> 43:48.253
-And us.
-Oh my God.

43:50.672 --> 43:54.259
Plant based food on
an open grill, scary.

43:54.300 --> 43:56.136
This is killing me right now.

43:56.177 --> 43:57.721
Pick a new batch.

43:57.762 --> 43:59.597
It needs to be on the fryer.

44:01.182 --> 44:03.685
You made the flat
bread on the grill?

44:03.727 --> 44:05.311
Yeah.

44:05.353 --> 44:08.440
Go on with your
bad self then, okay.

44:08.481 --> 44:11.568
Brooke is white as a ghost.
