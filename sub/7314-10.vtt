00:27.494 --> 00:28.494
Here you go,
ma'am.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.362
Thank you.
Merry christmas.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.630
Welcome home,
commander.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.033
Hey, joe.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.801
How was the tour?

00:35.803 --> 00:37.302
Too long.

00:37.304 --> 00:39.538
Your house
looks great.
Thanks.

00:39.540 --> 00:43.442
I see my husband didn't exactly
knock himself out with ours.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.544
Well, happy
holidays.

00:51.818 --> 00:54.086
Noel!

00:57.724 --> 00:59.792
Noel!

01:01.194 --> 01:03.395
(indistinct voices murmur
over television)

01:09.069 --> 01:10.135
(sniffs)

01:10.137 --> 01:12.271
What's that terrible smell?

01:15.508 --> 01:17.276
...Dancer, prancer,

01:17.278 --> 01:19.478
Vixen, there we go.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.712
(gasps)

02:00.620 --> 02:02.287
Woman:
I thought he'd
pick me up

02:02.289 --> 02:03.789
At the airport
last night,

02:03.791 --> 02:05.824
But when he didn't show,
I had to take a cab.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.459
Where were you?

02:07.461 --> 02:08.660
The gulf.

02:08.662 --> 02:09.661
Aboard the <i>stennis.</i>

02:09.663 --> 02:11.463
For the last
six months.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.532
When was the last time
you spoke to your husband?

02:13.534 --> 02:14.533
Thanksgiving.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.535
When <i>I</i> called <i>him.</i>

02:16.537 --> 02:19.171
That was almost a month ago.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.540
Where'd your husband work?

02:21.542 --> 02:22.908
Work?

02:22.910 --> 02:26.778
He was an unemployed
navy husband, agent gibbs.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.547
Thank you, commander.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.282
Appreciate it.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.290
Don't take this the
wrong way, dr. Mallard.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.725
I love my job--
I really do-- but I

02:39.727 --> 02:43.529
The odor of a
decomposed body.
Ducky:
Ah, yes.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.198
The pungent bouquet
of hydrogen sulfide

02:46.200 --> 02:48.167
And methane.
(sniffs)

02:48.169 --> 02:49.768
(sniffs)

02:49.770 --> 02:51.904
With a faint hint of
<i>corpus mercurium captans.</i>

02:51.906 --> 02:53.572
Jimmy:
Well...

02:53.574 --> 02:56.808
That would make it a
perfect day at the office.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.377
Well, no sign of
forced entry, boss.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.611
Nothing appears to be missing.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.180
How's long has he
been here, duck?

03:01.182 --> 03:02.314
Ducky:
Educated guess?

03:02.316 --> 03:03.482
Three or four weeks.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.450
Well, that works.
Based on postmarks,

03:05.452 --> 03:07.586
Mail's been collecting
since November 27.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.555
Anything else?

03:09.557 --> 03:10.722
No visible wounds.

03:11.724 --> 03:12.958
Hopefully,

03:12.960 --> 03:14.960
Cause of death
will be determined

03:14.962 --> 03:16.862
At autopsy.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.364
Mcgee:
<i>Neighbors we spoke to</i>

03:19.366 --> 03:21.200
Hadn't seen him
in weeks, but they

03:21.202 --> 03:25.204
His employment record
was spotty.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.805
(phone chimes)

03:27.707 --> 03:29.208
Sorry, it's my flight app.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.610
Dad's plane's
been delayed.

03:31.612 --> 03:35.280
Long on a job,
had not worked in over a year.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.348
He was also
estranged

03:36.350 --> 03:37.583
From the rest of his family.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.351
Record?

03:39.353 --> 03:41.653
Any criminal record?

03:41.655 --> 03:42.888
No.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.856
Uh, well,
I mean,

03:44.858 --> 03:47.226
There was a dui back in...
In 2009.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.627
There's a storm in new york.

03:48.629 --> 03:51.496
It's always complicated
with senior.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.232
Where's your
dad going?

03:53.234 --> 03:55.367
Going? Oh, I wish.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.402
He's coming. Here.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.372
He says he wants to spend
christmas with me.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.708
You did not tell us your father
would be coming to town.

04:02.710 --> 04:03.709
I didn't
really think

04:03.711 --> 04:05.010
It was going to happen.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.679
Because something
always comes up, doesn't it?

04:07.681 --> 04:09.348
Well, I think it
sounds wonderful.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.349
Well,
I don't.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.950
We're not...

04:11.952 --> 04:13.452
It doesn't... (sighs)

04:13.454 --> 04:15.520
It always ends up
in an argument.

Where's his clothes?
Still in the air dryer.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.918
Trust me, you do not want
to deal with them right now.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.421

Men are so simple.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.474
You can't even
close the snap.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.776
It would take hours

05:10.778 --> 05:12.311
To go through
all the cards.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.946
He has two.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.448
Oh, there's another
bill in here.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.850
Must be his emergency stash.

05:18.852 --> 05:21.086
Hmm.

05:21.088 --> 05:24.323
What is this?

05:27.860 --> 05:30.495
Doesn't look like any
$100 bill I've ever seen.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.968
Man:
It's authentic.
Tony:
You're kidding.

Old ben franklin looks
like he's on steroids.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.474
We call it the new benjamin.
It was designed

05:42.476 --> 05:44.409
To replace all
existing $100 bills.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.478
Where did ncis get this?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.447
Found it on a dead body.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.449
Something's very wrong here.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.351
This new currency

05:52.353 --> 05:54.453
Hasn't been put
into circulation yet.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.421
None of it
has ever

05:56.423 --> 05:57.856
Left our control.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.991
Or been outside
a treasury building.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.505
Over a decade
of research and development

06:13.507 --> 06:15.407
Went into the new benjamin's
security features.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.675
Let me show you.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.910
The changes include

06:18.912 --> 06:20.979
Color-shifting numbers
and liberty bell,

06:20.981 --> 06:22.481
A 3-d ribbon

06:22.483 --> 06:24.015
And raised printing.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.617
It's counterfeit-proof.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.552
When's it going to be
put into circulation?

06:27.554 --> 06:29.821
Initially, the bills
were going to be released

06:29.823 --> 06:31.423
In February 2011,

06:31.425 --> 06:33.425
But there were production
problems and distribution

06:33.427 --> 06:34.659
Was delayed.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.695
So what's the problem?

06:36.697 --> 06:39.097
Well, um, because of all
the new security features,

06:39.099 --> 06:41.566
It proved to be a very
difficult bill to produce.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.535
Um, during the printing process,

06:43.537 --> 06:45.637
There were little creases
in the notes.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.139
Little creases?

06:47.141 --> 06:48.607
It's kind of
a technical thing.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.742
(phone ringing)

06:51.677 --> 06:53.845
Sorry.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.981
Um, much to our
embarrassment...

06:55.983 --> 06:57.549
(ringing continues)
...Uh, bills with

06:57.551 --> 06:58.917
A face value of

06:58.919 --> 07:01.686
$110 billion were printed.

07:01.688 --> 07:02.988
We're not
exactly sure

07:02.990 --> 07:04.623
How many of them
are flawed,

07:04.625 --> 07:07.159
But estimates go, uh,
to, uh, 30%.

07:07.161 --> 07:09.828
Wow. You'd get a big head slap
in our building

07:09.830 --> 07:11.062
For that.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.063
That's... That's a big number.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.098
So heads rolled?

07:13.100 --> 07:18.570
Get into finger-pointing here
at the bep, agent dinozzo.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.005
Where are the bills now?

07:20.007 --> 07:21.440
In vaults
in fort worth, texas,

07:21.442 --> 07:23.175
And here in washington.

07:23.177 --> 07:25.544
(phone ringing)

07:27.180 --> 07:28.613
Sorry. I...

07:31.050 --> 07:32.717
(sighs)
it's senior.

07:32.719 --> 07:34.619
I'll make it quick.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.821
Let me check the serial number.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.155
Hi, dad.

07:37.157 --> 07:40.492
No, I'm in the middle
of an investigation.

07:40.494 --> 07:41.960
No!

07:41.962 --> 07:43.995
That does not
work for me.

07:43.997 --> 07:47.032
(hushed):
No! Take a cab!

07:47.034 --> 07:48.900
(computer trills)

07:48.902 --> 07:50.535
The serial number

07:50.537 --> 07:51.670
Is from an early batch

07:51.672 --> 07:52.871
That was shredded
and disposed of

07:52.873 --> 07:54.172
A year and a half ago.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.174
Obviously, it wasn't.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.777
Secret service special agent
ashley winter.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.946
Heard ncis
was in the building.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.981
Would've appreciated
a call.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.817
How much more
is missing, donald?

08:05.819 --> 08:09.054
Um, I-I don't know.
I-I just heard about this.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.523
And, uh, but we're-we're
gonna get into it.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.625
When we first found
the flaw,

08:13.627 --> 08:16.061
We shredded millions
of dollars' worth

08:16.063 --> 08:17.929
Of the new benjamins.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.564
It's what we
routinely do with any

08:19.566 --> 08:20.966
Worn or damaged
u.S. Currency.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.134
I'll keep this.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.603
It's property
of the treasury department.

08:25.638 --> 08:28.773
No. No, I-I don't think so...

08:28.775 --> 08:30.842
Ashley winter.

08:30.844 --> 08:34.613
No, it's evidence in an
ncis death investigation.

08:35.882 --> 08:37.682
Mcgee:
<i>Records show that noel huffner</i>

08:37.684 --> 08:39.017
Never gained access

08:39.019 --> 08:40.986
To the bureau of engraving
and printing building.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.822
Ziva:
And we have not been able
to connect him to anyone there.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.557
So how'd he get the bill?

08:45.559 --> 08:46.958
Abby:
Hey, guys!

08:46.960 --> 08:48.860
Look who I found
down in the lobby.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.062
Dad, what are you
doing here?

08:51.064 --> 08:53.532
Ziva, show me some love.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.066
Oh!

08:55.068 --> 08:56.568
Dad, I thought you
were taking a cab

08:56.570 --> 08:57.736
From the airport
to the hotel.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.604
No hotel.

08:59.606 --> 09:02.641
I came to spend christmas
with you. Gibbs.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.642
Good to see you, a.D.

09:03.644 --> 09:04.676
Nice to see you.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.244
Happy holidays, mr. Dinozzo.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.713
Same to you, tim.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.550
I don't understand.
Where are you staying?

09:11.552 --> 09:13.184
At your place.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.755
No! No, no, no, no.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.657
Because it's...
It's not big enough.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.892
Oh, come on, junior.
You've got room.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.093
Doesn't he?

09:26.799 --> 09:29.067
Um, I...

09:30.202 --> 09:32.103
I would not know.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.072
I've never been invited.

09:36.008 --> 09:37.075
Is that true?

09:37.977 --> 09:39.711
What's the matter with you?

09:39.713 --> 09:40.979
You're gonna be spending
the holidays together.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.181
It's so sweet!
No.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.683
Yes, of course.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.952
But not in...
Because here's the thing.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.054
It's a one-bedroom.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.622
It's so small.

09:50.624 --> 09:51.890
It's like a habitrail.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.359
But I'm gonna call
the adams house.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.729
I'm gonna get you a sweet suite,
my treat.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.764
No, no, no, no, junior,
I wouldn't hear of it.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.700
I'll sleep on the couch
if I have to.

10:01.702 --> 10:05.370
Woman: Happy holidays.
Adams house. Laurel speaking.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.372
Come on, tony.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.074
Hello? Hello?

10:09.076 --> 10:12.243
Okay, that'd be great.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.679
So, you'll be joining us
christmas eve?

10:14.681 --> 10:15.914
Oh.
Tony's started

10:15.916 --> 10:17.048
This tradition
where we all watch

10:17.050 --> 10:18.183
It's a wonderful life
together.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.985
Abby, if you're
going to be there,

10:19.987 --> 10:21.252
I wouldn't miss it.

10:22.154 --> 10:25.256
Junior.
Dad.

10:27.827 --> 10:30.261
Jimmy:
I don't get it. Autopsy's done.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.731
Usually agent gibbs
has been down here by now.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.633
(elevator bell rings)

10:34.635 --> 10:35.834
Methinks you have

10:35.836 --> 10:37.669
Just spoken of the devil,
mr. Palmer.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.204
What do we know?

10:39.206 --> 10:41.706
Cause of death
was a broken neck.

10:41.708 --> 10:46.011
Shattered the c-6
and c-5 vertebrae.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.646
Almost severed
the spinal cord.

10:47.648 --> 10:50.015
He didn't die
in that chair, jethro.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.950
It was definitely a homicide.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.818
Anything else?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.120
Well, although
it didn't kill him,

10:55.122 --> 10:56.955
Mr. Huffner had
cirrhosis of the liver.

10:56.957 --> 11:00.025
He was likely a
heavy drinker.

11:03.095 --> 11:05.096
All right, here we are.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.165
(siren wailing in distance)

11:15.241 --> 11:18.843
Junior... Not what I expected.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.345
Yeah, my girl,

11:20.347 --> 11:21.980
There you go.

11:21.982 --> 11:22.981
There's some treats.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.115
That's my good girl.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.116
(kissing)

11:25.118 --> 11:26.251
You're getting fat.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.256
My goldfish.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.724
Her name is kate.

11:40.232 --> 11:41.800
How long have you lived here?

11:41.802 --> 11:43.735
Almost 12 years.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.104
You want to wash up
before we eat?

11:46.106 --> 11:50.275
Should we cook something here
or go out?

11:50.277 --> 11:52.377
I don't really keep a lot
of food in the house, dad.

11:57.483 --> 11:59.317
We'll go out.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.486
All right, dad, you're
gonna stay in my room,

12:01.488 --> 12:03.755
And I'll hit the couch.

12:06.492 --> 12:08.059
(grunts)

12:09.028 --> 12:10.161
That's your bed?

12:10.163 --> 12:11.763
Yeah.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.466
Not much room for play.

12:14.468 --> 12:18.036
Well, when I come home,
dad, I sleep alone.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.771
You're serious?

12:19.773 --> 12:21.773
(sighs)

12:21.775 --> 12:23.441
Dad, this is my sanctuary.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.076
Okay?

12:25.078 --> 12:27.946
If I'm going to see a lady,
I will stay at her place.

12:27.948 --> 12:30.815
That way,
I can leave when I want

12:30.817 --> 12:33.885
And nobody overstays
their welcome.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.123
What?

12:38.125 --> 12:40.859
You're missing
so many things--

12:40.861 --> 12:44.963
Intimacy, commitment.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.464
You know,

12:46.466 --> 12:48.166
I'll see if we can
get a reservation

12:48.168 --> 12:50.401
At the rooftop grill.

12:52.171 --> 12:54.239
Hope it's not my fault.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.874
Hey, this is
anthony dinozzo.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.409
Can I get a table for
two up on the rooftop?

13:03.048 --> 13:06.217
Abby... What are you doing?

13:06.219 --> 13:10.955
This ornament has been
in my family since the 1890s.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.457
It was my great-great-
grandmother's.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.025
So I'm trying to identify

13:14.027 --> 13:15.960
As many relatives that have
handled it as I can.

13:15.962 --> 13:20.165
I already found my great uncle
gooper and my aunt trixie.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.199
Mm-hmm.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.801
Ask her how she got a match.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.170
I used to fingerprint all
my relatives at our reunions.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.839
I started when I was
11 years old.

13:27.841 --> 13:30.542
You got anything on
huffner's computer or cell?

13:31.443 --> 13:32.510
Uh, not really, but...

13:32.512 --> 13:33.545
We have
something much,

13:33.547 --> 13:35.313
Much better.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.016
Besides noel huffner's
fingerprint,

13:38.018 --> 13:40.451
I also found someone else's
on this c-note,

13:40.453 --> 13:43.054
And reliable old afis
got us a match.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.522
You gonna give
me a name?

13:44.524 --> 13:47.058
Second print belonged
to a justin cannady,

13:47.060 --> 13:48.927
And it gets better, boss.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.496
Not only did he
work at the bureau

13:51.498 --> 13:52.964
Of engraving and printing;

13:52.966 --> 13:55.200
He was fired
from there last year.

13:56.602 --> 13:59.604
Huffner was working
with an inside man.

14:06.278 --> 14:07.879
(elevator bell dings)

14:07.881 --> 14:09.514
(tony groaning)

14:13.953 --> 14:16.521
Tony... You all right?

14:16.523 --> 14:19.557
No. I slept
on the couch last night.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.159
I got a kink
in my neck and kinks

14:21.161 --> 14:23.161
In my back-- it's killing me.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.495
What'd you find out?
Justin cannady

14:24.497 --> 14:25.997
Was not at
his apartment.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.265
Secret service had the place
locked down

14:27.267 --> 14:29.267
And would not let us in.
We should have searched

14:29.269 --> 14:33.137
The place ourselves
before we told agent winter.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.306
She issued a bolo
but couldn't stop us

14:35.308 --> 14:37.008
From questioning
cannady's neighbors.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.910
No one had seen
him in weeks.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.011
Ziva: You able
to connect cannady

14:40.013 --> 14:41.012
To our dead navy husband?

14:41.014 --> 14:42.614
Not yet.

14:42.616 --> 14:46.184
So you have just been lying down
on the job while we were gone.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.886
Timmy, remote.

14:49.521 --> 14:51.256
Check out
his credit score.

14:51.258 --> 14:54.325
It's lower than mcgee's
self-esteem in high school.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.093
(chuckles)

14:55.095 --> 14:56.127
Cannady is broke.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.195
Unemployment insurance

14:57.197 --> 14:59.664
Ran out last month,
car was repo'd,

14:59.666 --> 15:02.066
He's two months behind
on his rent.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.134
Gibbs.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.535
Oh, my god.

15:05.971 --> 15:08.339
Where did
that susan b. Anthony dollar go?

15:08.341 --> 15:10.341
She likes to roll.

15:10.343 --> 15:14.379
Oh, agent winter,
what are you doing here?

15:14.381 --> 15:16.981
I was summoned

15:16.983 --> 15:18.383
To brief you.

15:18.385 --> 15:22.086
At the bureau of engraving
and printing until last June.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.421
Why'd he get fired?

15:23.423 --> 15:26.224
Tardiness and being
drunk on the job.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.626
Cannady lost two fingers
in an accident.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.295
Ouch.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.063
He operated a shredding machine.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.965
Assistant director linder
had to let him go.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.266
Linder-- isn't that
the squirrelly guy

15:35.268 --> 15:36.968
That we talked to?
Gibbs:
Coworkers heard

15:36.970 --> 15:38.503
From cannady since?
No.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.638
Is more money missing?

15:40.640 --> 15:42.941
No way of telling.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.409
You think cannady killed
your navy husband?

15:44.411 --> 15:45.643
Mcgee:
Your agents

15:45.645 --> 15:47.378
Turn up anything
at cannady's apartment?

15:47.380 --> 15:48.379
No.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.981
They tore
that place apart.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.950
I'd like to do the same
to huffner's house.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.384
(chuckling)

15:53.386 --> 15:55.219
No, that's not gonna
happen, agent winter.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.422
That's on a
navy base.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.523
You handled
cannady's apartment.

15:58.525 --> 16:03.695
Special agents dinozzo and
mcgee were just leaving.

16:03.697 --> 16:05.697
It's always a pleasure.

16:06.999 --> 16:09.000
Megan:
<i>I went to use</i>

16:09.002 --> 16:11.069
My credit cards at the
navy exchange this morning,

16:11.071 --> 16:12.070
And they were
both declined

16:12.072 --> 16:14.672
Because my slug
of a husband drew

16:14.674 --> 16:18.176
$5,000 against each
of the cards.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.545
He forged
my signature.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.313
What was he up to?

16:22.315 --> 16:24.315
That's what we're trying
to find out, commander.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.384
Well, do you at least
know how he died?

16:26.386 --> 16:29.220
Yeah, he was murdered.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.321
We suspect
he was involved

16:30.323 --> 16:32.023
In criminal activity
with a man named

16:32.025 --> 16:33.691
Justin cannady.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.561
Do you know him?

16:36.563 --> 16:39.063
Never seen him.

16:39.065 --> 16:41.232
You aware that your husband
had a liver condition?

16:41.234 --> 16:42.700
No, but I'm not surprised.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.035
He drank too much,

16:44.037 --> 16:46.037
And I always knew
where to find him.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.306
Where was that?

16:48.308 --> 16:50.575
Gillespie's saloon
on prescott street.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.044
So do you know
when I'm gonna be able

16:53.046 --> 16:54.312
To get into my house again?

16:54.314 --> 16:56.214
There are things
that I have to do.

16:58.050 --> 17:00.118
We'll let you know
when we're finished.

17:03.355 --> 17:06.290
Did you find anything
downstairs?

17:06.292 --> 17:08.026
Done in the bedroom.

17:08.028 --> 17:11.195
Yeah, well, you always
have to suspect the wife.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.463
She was halfway
around the world.

17:12.465 --> 17:13.564
She could have
hired someone.

17:13.566 --> 17:17.301
Listen, I need you
to crack my back.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.337
(scoffs)
go to a chiropractor.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.072
I don't have time.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.340
I need it now.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.042
All right,
if I do it this once,

17:24.044 --> 17:25.109
Will you stop complaining?

17:25.111 --> 17:26.210
No complaining.

17:29.314 --> 17:31.249
You're a buddy.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.250
(grunts)

17:32.252 --> 17:33.251
(cracks)
oh, that's good,

17:33.253 --> 17:34.252
That's good.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.386
Okay, let me
just relax.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.387
(exhales)

17:36.389 --> 17:38.089
Now just give me
a little bounce.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.358
(cracks)
oh-ho-ho, aah!

17:40.360 --> 17:41.793
One more.

17:41.795 --> 17:43.161
(grunts)

17:43.163 --> 17:44.395
More.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.097
Oh!
(phone ringing)

17:46.099 --> 17:47.565
Whose is that?

17:47.567 --> 17:49.634
It's mine.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.569
Just put me down real slow.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.603
Real slow.

17:52.605 --> 17:56.107
(sighing)

17:56.109 --> 17:58.142
Thank you. I'm a
little light-headed.

17:58.144 --> 17:59.243
(line ringing)

17:59.245 --> 18:00.511
Hey, dad.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.180
Where do you keep
your roasting pan?

18:03.148 --> 18:05.149
Dad, I don't have
a roasting pan.

18:05.151 --> 18:06.317
I don't cook.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.618
What are you doing?

18:07.620 --> 18:09.854
I'm getting ready
for a traditional

18:09.856 --> 18:11.656
Dinozzo christmas dinner.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.658
Takes days of prep.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.293
Traditional dinner?

18:15.295 --> 18:16.727
Listen, dad,

18:16.729 --> 18:18.429
Can you hold
off, please?

18:18.431 --> 18:20.398
'cause I...
We'll talk about it tonight.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.732
Okay?

18:21.734 --> 18:24.502
(dial tone, beeps)

18:24.504 --> 18:26.170
(groans)

18:26.172 --> 18:28.139
You should appreciate
your father.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.674
I never had family traditions.

18:29.676 --> 18:32.410
Well, we haven't had them
for years.

18:32.412 --> 18:36.347
Traditions kind of died
with my grandfather.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.716
Senior was kind of
an absentee parent.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.786
You know,
long-standing customs kind of...

18:41.788 --> 18:44.755
Disappeared.

18:44.757 --> 18:48.493
Along with a certain
family signet ring.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.194
It was always
passed on

18:50.196 --> 18:51.829
To the next generation
on the christmas

18:51.831 --> 18:54.165
Of the son's 21st birthday.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.300
I never got it.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.736
Senior claimed it was stolen.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.405
"I was mugged, junior."

19:01.407 --> 19:05.409
But I think he pawned it
during the bad times.

19:05.411 --> 19:08.146
Hey, come over here and help me
with this, will you?

19:08.148 --> 19:10.414
Sure. (groans)

19:10.416 --> 19:12.483
Thank you for that, by the way.
Much better.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.253
All right, we're gonna lift
this right here.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.320
All right, ready?

19:16.322 --> 19:19.257
One, two, three.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.325
Oh, look at that.

19:40.579 --> 19:42.413
(knocking on door)

19:44.883 --> 19:47.218
They don't open till 4:00.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.753
Maybe he's setting up.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.688
Let's check around back.

19:55.661 --> 19:58.229
Gibbs:
Hello.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.464
Ncis special agents gibbs
and david.

20:00.466 --> 20:01.766
You got a minute?

20:01.768 --> 20:03.301
Ncis?

20:03.303 --> 20:06.237
I'd like to talk to you
about noel huffner.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.772
Okay.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.707
Um, I got to open
in a half an hour.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.742
You mind if we talk inside?
Nah.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.244
I recognize the grill.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.378
It's a '53, right?

20:14.380 --> 20:15.746
It was my old man's.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.716
The original gillespie,
he bought it new.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.552
Ziva:
<i>Huffner's wife</i>
<i>said he's a regular here.</i>

20:21.554 --> 20:22.787
Yeah.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.256
And I've talked to her
a couple of times.

20:25.258 --> 20:28.392
She calls here when he
won't answer his cell.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.994
Problems in the marriage?

20:29.996 --> 20:31.262
(chuckles)

20:31.264 --> 20:32.530
I think I'm gonna invoke

20:32.532 --> 20:33.798
Bartender/patron
confidentiality.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.700
I don't want
to get a regular in trouble.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.535
You're not gonna
get huffner in trouble.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.569
He's dead.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.471
Oh.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.940
I guess that's why
I haven't seen him in a while.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.408
He's a young guy.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.509
What happened?

20:45.511 --> 20:46.577
Do you know him?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.879
Yeah. Justin.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.415
I don't think I ever heard
his last name before.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.817
Justin and huffner
know each other?

20:52.819 --> 20:54.252
Oh, yeah.
The two of them

20:54.254 --> 20:55.820
Sit down there at
the end of the bar

20:55.822 --> 20:58.322
Just about every night,
like cliff and norm.

20:58.324 --> 20:59.690
(chuckles)

20:59.692 --> 21:01.292
I haven't seen justin

21:01.294 --> 21:02.627
In a while, either.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.762
Well, if justin comes in,

21:04.764 --> 21:06.264
Would you give us a call?

21:06.266 --> 21:09.000
Yeah, sure.

21:09.002 --> 21:10.268
Hey, um...

21:11.436 --> 21:13.271
You never told me how noel died.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.906
He was murdered.

21:23.048 --> 21:24.849
What are you doing?

21:24.851 --> 21:27.318
What's it look like?

21:27.320 --> 21:29.787
Decorating the christmas tree.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.522
Beautiful, isn't it?

21:31.524 --> 21:33.324
Big, full, great.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.493
You moved my piano.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.928
Well, I had to put the tree
in the window.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.867
Oh, what...
What happened in here?

21:42.869 --> 21:44.502
Is this how you're
going to react

21:44.504 --> 21:47.004
To all the hard work
I did today?

21:47.006 --> 21:49.607
I baked your favorite
christmas cookies.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.375
Snickerdoodles.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.010
Used your mother's recipe.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.012
I knew your staying
here was a mistake.

21:55.014 --> 21:58.015
Look... This is my
apartment, okay?

21:58.017 --> 21:59.617
This is my space.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.752
Junior... Chill.

22:01.754 --> 22:02.987
Chill.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.622
Get the christmas spirit.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.891
Woman (knocking):
Tony?
I'll get it.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.859
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Look,

22:08.861 --> 22:10.728
We can't let her know
that we're here.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.029
Woman:
I know you're home, tony.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.398
(whispers):
Ignore her.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.733
Who is she?

22:15.735 --> 22:18.469
She's the bloodhound from
across the hall. Shh.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.471
(knocking)

22:21.773 --> 22:26.944
Tony sr.: Ooh, ooh.
Ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.613
Have you closed
the deal on that?

22:29.615 --> 22:31.549
(whispers):
Dad! Shh.

22:37.055 --> 22:39.490
All right, listen,
something's come up at work.

22:39.492 --> 22:42.526
I got to go.
Well, when
will you be home?

22:42.528 --> 22:44.595
I don't know.

22:52.738 --> 22:54.605
Mcgee:
Hikers found the body
just before sunset.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.740
There's no I.D.

23:01.012 --> 23:03.748
Duck, why'd the leos
think it was cannady?

23:03.750 --> 23:08.152
He's missing the appropriate
two digits.

23:08.154 --> 23:09.854
How long has he been dead?

23:09.856 --> 23:13.391
Oh, I'd venture the same
amount of time as mr. Huffner.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.059
Oh, great!
I got my maggots!

23:15.061 --> 23:16.694
(jimmy chuckles)

23:16.696 --> 23:19.964
This is shaping up to
be one disgusting week.

23:19.966 --> 23:21.165
(vehicle approaching)

23:24.736 --> 23:25.936
Aw, hell.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.171
Get the body into the van.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.806
Don't need agent winter
snooping around.

23:28.808 --> 23:29.974
Ducky:
Let's go, mr. Palmer.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.476
Chop-chop.
One, two, three.

23:32.478 --> 23:33.944
Tony:
Boss is gonna
head her off at the pass.

23:33.946 --> 23:34.945
Hey, winter.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.081
Agent gibbs.
What do we got?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.616
I don't know.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.518
May or may not be cannady.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.619
Oh. Huh.

23:41.621 --> 23:45.156
You're gonna make it down
that way in those heels.

23:45.158 --> 23:47.658
No...
Come on, I'll
show you a better way.

23:47.660 --> 23:48.726
Gibbs: Look--
it's right there.

23:48.728 --> 23:51.595
Tony:
And she's clueless.

23:52.831 --> 23:55.199
Agent winter has no idea
what she's up against.

23:56.468 --> 23:58.068
Nicely done.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.804
Well, with cannady dead,

23:59.806 --> 24:01.872
We're looking for
another killer.

24:08.513 --> 24:10.714
Mcgee:
Noel huffner had $400,000

24:10.716 --> 24:13.050
Of the new, uncirculated
$100 bills

24:13.052 --> 24:17.121
And all the serial numbers
came from a batch that was

24:17.123 --> 24:19.523
Supposedly shredded
on may 2, 2011.

24:19.525 --> 24:21.025
And justin cannady was working

24:21.027 --> 24:23.527
At the bureau of engraving
and printing as a shredder.

24:23.529 --> 24:24.995
It is safe to say
he was involved.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.130
Right. So the
questions are:

24:26.132 --> 24:28.532
How much more
might have been stolen,

24:28.534 --> 24:31.035
Of such a heavily
secured building?

24:31.037 --> 24:33.137
That a snickerdoodle?

24:33.139 --> 24:34.538
Yes.

24:34.540 --> 24:35.806
Where'd you get 'em?

24:35.808 --> 24:38.542
Senior. He bakes.

24:38.544 --> 24:40.077
Who knew?
Would you like one?

24:40.079 --> 24:41.645
Ziva?
(groans)
no.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.682
Uh, so you think the $10,000
that huffner borrowed

24:44.684 --> 24:47.618
From the credit cards
has anything to do with this?

24:47.620 --> 24:49.787
What if huffner bought
some of the new benjamins

24:49.789 --> 24:52.089
At a discount
from his bar buddy, cannady?

24:52.091 --> 24:55.493
You know, like,
$10,000 for $400,000?

24:55.495 --> 24:57.127
Think about it--
cannady couldn't spend

24:57.129 --> 24:59.697
Any of the new currency until
it was put into circulation.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.699
But he was in debt
and needed money.

25:01.701 --> 25:04.568
Maybe he got antsy
and decided to...

25:04.570 --> 25:07.137
Sell some of the uncirculated
cash to huffner.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.840
Well, that may all be true,

25:09.842 --> 25:12.910
But why are they both dead?

25:14.579 --> 25:16.580
What am I looking at?

25:16.582 --> 25:19.617
Fibers, magnified
a thousand times.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.585
These eensy-weensy
little buggers

25:21.587 --> 25:24.288
Were statically attracted
to the shrink-wrap

25:24.290 --> 25:26.924
On the currency hidden
in huffner's house.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.259
What are the fibers?

25:28.261 --> 25:29.593
Particles...

25:29.595 --> 25:31.595
Of shredded new benjies.

25:31.597 --> 25:33.597
The money was heavily
guarded in a vault

25:33.599 --> 25:35.633
Until some of it was
shredded for disposal.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.034
Watch this.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.770
Voilà.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.972
The new benjies
left the building...

25:41.974 --> 25:43.641
In the trash.

25:45.677 --> 25:48.245
Yeah, I know it's our first
christmas as a married couple,

25:48.247 --> 25:51.015
And I want it
to be special, but I...

25:51.017 --> 25:52.616
Breena, I got to go.

25:53.652 --> 25:56.120
Special agent winter, isn't it?

25:56.122 --> 25:58.322
Is that the body I didn't
get to see last night?

25:58.324 --> 26:01.025
Does special agent gibbs

26:01.027 --> 26:02.626
Know that you're down here?

26:02.628 --> 26:04.161
Have you
made a positive

26:04.163 --> 26:05.996
Identification yet?

26:05.998 --> 26:08.866
Well, you must understand
how difficult it is

26:08.868 --> 26:10.134
To lift a fingerprint

26:10.136 --> 26:11.201
From a body
that has been

26:11.203 --> 26:12.903
Exposed to the elements

26:12.905 --> 26:15.139
For so long a time.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.207
First, you must

26:17.209 --> 26:20.578
Carefully remove
the dermis.

26:22.814 --> 26:25.950
Then, using your own
gloved hands,

26:25.952 --> 26:28.919
You spread the dermis

26:28.921 --> 26:30.654
Over a corresponding finger.

26:31.856 --> 26:34.792
Roll it in the ink

26:34.794 --> 26:36.126
And then on paper.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.329
And have you been able...
I first used the process

26:38.331 --> 26:39.730
When I was in india.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.999
Yes, in the city of allahabad.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.000
Dr. Mallard,

26:43.002 --> 26:44.268
Cut the crap.

26:45.338 --> 26:49.873
If I find out you're impeding
a secret service investigation,

26:49.875 --> 26:51.609
Do you understand...
Gibbs: This is an
ncis investigation,

26:51.611 --> 26:54.178
And dr. Mallard is doing exactly
what he needs to be doing.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.680
I thought we were gonna work
with each other, gibbs.

26:56.682 --> 26:58.315
We are.

26:58.317 --> 26:59.817
Tell her what
you know, duck.

27:01.219 --> 27:03.053
We have
a positive identification.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.089
This is justin cannady.

27:05.091 --> 27:08.926
The cause of death,
cervical fracture.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.829
Identical to mr. Huffner's,
I might add.

27:11.831 --> 27:14.231
Anything else?

27:14.233 --> 27:15.833
Yeah, just got a lead.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.234
We need to talk

27:17.236 --> 27:18.769
To assistant director linder.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.237
Hmm.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.972
You're not doing it without me.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.908
Wouldn't think of it.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.982
(chuckles)

27:31.984 --> 27:34.818
It's very unlikely
that any of the currency

27:34.820 --> 27:36.387
Was removed from the vaults.

27:36.389 --> 27:39.723
I've got $400,000
of your new bills

27:39.725 --> 27:41.392
At ncis that says
you're wrong.

27:41.394 --> 27:43.293
I don't know, okay?

27:43.295 --> 27:46.096
All bills that are removed
from the vaults are shredded,

27:46.098 --> 27:48.432
Compacted into bales
and disposed of.

27:48.434 --> 27:49.800
Where?

27:49.802 --> 27:51.368
That was a year and a half ago.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.937
We have contracts with several
different landfills.

27:53.939 --> 27:56.206
Okay, well, we'll narrow it
down for you, donald.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.342
Which one was used
on may 2 of last year.

28:01.279 --> 28:02.413
Be assured we're gonna be

28:02.415 --> 28:03.881
Shaking up things
in this department.

28:07.886 --> 28:10.688
Try the adams county landfill
in virginia.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.292
(bell dings)

28:15.294 --> 28:17.027
Thanks, chris. Hi, santa.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.395
Hi, sweetheart.

28:18.397 --> 28:19.396
Mwah.

28:19.398 --> 28:20.898
Tony's out
in the field.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.766
Did he know you
were coming?
No, I'm, uh,

28:22.768 --> 28:24.835
Here to deliver presents.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.303
Ah.

28:26.305 --> 28:30.741
And this is for you,
my dear.

28:30.743 --> 28:32.876
Thank you.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.878
Even though I do not
celebrate christmas,

28:34.880 --> 28:37.014
I love the
holiday season,

28:37.016 --> 28:39.016
And I'm very glad
you and tony

28:39.018 --> 28:40.484
Are going to be together.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.252
I'm not so sure that, uh,

28:42.254 --> 28:44.088
Tony feels that way.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.923
Things not going well?

28:45.925 --> 28:47.091
I think I'm trying

28:47.093 --> 28:49.493
To make up
for too many missed christmases

28:49.495 --> 28:50.994
All at once.

28:52.330 --> 28:55.766
Well, maybe you're
trying too hard.

28:55.768 --> 28:58.736
Well, junior's the only
family I have left.

28:58.738 --> 29:01.004
After his mother died,

29:01.006 --> 29:04.274
It... It just hasn't
been the same.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.443
He showed me a
picture of her.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.012
She was really
beautiful.

29:09.014 --> 29:12.816
Mm-hmm, inside and out.

29:12.818 --> 29:16.286
She was the love
of my life, ziva.

29:16.288 --> 29:19.823
I've never been able
to fill up that void.

29:19.825 --> 29:23.494
But god knows I've gotten
into a lot of trouble trying.

29:23.496 --> 29:25.763
(chuckles)

29:43.548 --> 29:45.315
Timmy?

29:45.317 --> 29:46.884
Stewie?

29:46.886 --> 29:48.285
Hey, man.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.419
How are you?

29:49.421 --> 29:50.854
Hey, man.
Hey, man.

29:50.856 --> 29:52.856
Good to see you.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.058
You guys know each other?

29:55.060 --> 29:56.293
Yeah, we went to
school together.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.461
M.I.T.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.996
M.I.T.?

29:58.998 --> 30:02.099
And now you work... Here.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.867
Last I heard,
you were teaching

30:03.869 --> 30:05.836
Computational
evolutionary biology.

30:05.838 --> 30:07.304
I was.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.006
Burnt out, man,

30:09.008 --> 30:10.541
But I found my calling, trash.

30:10.543 --> 30:12.843
Crazy, huh?

30:12.845 --> 30:14.311
You know you can learn
more about mankind

30:14.313 --> 30:15.512
By what it throws away

30:15.514 --> 30:17.147
Than you can in any classroom?

30:18.149 --> 30:19.149
What are you doing, timmy?

30:19.151 --> 30:21.151
I'm a federal agent, ncis.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.053
Shut up. No way.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.922
Whoa!

30:24.924 --> 30:26.456
You're packing a gun.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.826
This was one crazy dude
in college.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.360
Really knew how to have
a good time.

30:30.362 --> 30:32.930
Shut up. No way.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.398
Did he tell you he was
the school mascot?

30:34.400 --> 30:36.400
No.

30:36.402 --> 30:37.568
What was

30:37.570 --> 30:39.169
The m.I.T. Mascot?

30:39.171 --> 30:40.170
Really doesn't matter.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.172
Oh, yes, it does.
Stewie?

30:42.174 --> 30:43.473
A beaver.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.309
He was tim the beaver
our senior year.

30:45.311 --> 30:48.111
Please tell me you dressed up
like a beaver.

30:48.113 --> 30:49.313
Of course he did.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.914
Little teeth, just...

30:50.916 --> 30:51.982
Remember the...

30:51.984 --> 30:55.018
Oh. (squeals)

30:55.020 --> 30:56.386
Yeah.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.188
Listen, stewart, we're
trying to track down

30:58.190 --> 31:01.458
That came from the bureau
of engraving and printing

31:01.460 --> 31:03.460
On may 2, 2011.

31:03.462 --> 31:07.464
Let's see, may 2, 2011, uh,

31:07.466 --> 31:10.067
That'd be in g sector,
and by now,

31:10.069 --> 31:11.935
About 30 feet under.

31:11.937 --> 31:13.470
Uh, we had a break-in
that night.

31:13.472 --> 31:16.073
Police came to investigate,
shared a laugh.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.175
What would anyone steal
from the dump?

31:18.177 --> 31:20.611
I think we may have the answer.

31:20.613 --> 31:23.280
Yeah, I know you're
a smart guy, stewie,

31:23.282 --> 31:25.949
But how do you remember
the exact date of the break-in?

31:25.951 --> 31:28.085
Everybody remembers
where they were that day.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.153
Don't you? It was the night

31:30.155 --> 31:32.055
The navy seal team
took out bin laden.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.238
Dad?

31:48.240 --> 31:50.374
Junior?

31:50.376 --> 31:53.076
Wow.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.178
This looks fantastic.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.981
What do you think, kate?

31:57.983 --> 32:00.150
I didn't even know
it could look like this.

32:00.152 --> 32:01.351
(sniffs)

32:01.353 --> 32:03.553
Candles and everything.

32:03.555 --> 32:06.390
You know, you were right.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.392
This was a good idea.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.661
Thank you.

32:10.663 --> 32:12.162
Hey, listen.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.031
Maybe you want to grab
some dinner?

32:14.033 --> 32:16.133
(rustling)
uh, I'll be
right with you.

32:16.135 --> 32:20.304
(chuckles)

32:20.306 --> 32:23.206
(groans)

32:29.514 --> 32:31.615
Didn't expect you back so soon.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.318
Obviously.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.553
Didn't mean for you to see that.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.221
(chuckling):
Oh.

32:38.223 --> 32:41.124
It's forever etched
into my retinas.

32:42.093 --> 32:43.460
Hi, tony.

32:43.462 --> 32:44.695
Hi.

32:44.697 --> 32:46.396
(whispers):
Call me later.

32:53.538 --> 32:55.105
(chuckles)

32:55.107 --> 32:57.240
I'll have to burn the bed now.

32:57.242 --> 32:59.643
Aw, come on, junior.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.645
Don't make a big deal
out of this.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.647
Well, you nearly pulled it off.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.148
You know?

33:05.150 --> 33:06.750
It was almost like old times.

33:08.353 --> 33:11.188
Have to go just
a little too far.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.622
Ah.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.624
What can I say?

33:14.626 --> 33:16.626
I'm me.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.628
I'm not going to change.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.998
I know.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.100
I know you're not
going to change.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.102
And I don't know
why I was smiling,

33:25.104 --> 33:27.604
'cause there's nothing funny
about this.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.339
Dad, this is my home.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.475
I told you,

33:31.477 --> 33:34.177
My rules, okay?
Uh-huh.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.179
And you broke them.

33:36.181 --> 33:38.248
(sighs)

33:39.317 --> 33:43.086
It was a mistake
having you here for christmas.

33:44.055 --> 33:47.157
You want me to leave?

33:56.367 --> 33:58.769
(phone ringing)

33:58.771 --> 33:59.770
Aren't you gonna
open your cookies?

33:59.772 --> 34:01.505
I thought you were not supposed

34:01.507 --> 34:03.373
To open presents until...
Christmas morning.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.675
Snickerdoodles don't count.

34:05.677 --> 34:08.145
(chuckles)

34:08.147 --> 34:09.679
I'm worried.

34:09.681 --> 34:12.149
About tony and his father.

34:12.151 --> 34:13.283
Did he say what happened?

34:13.285 --> 34:15.085
No.

34:15.087 --> 34:16.620
Just that it was complicated.

34:16.622 --> 34:17.654
Where's dinozzo?

34:17.656 --> 34:19.089
Ziva:
He's on his way.

34:19.091 --> 34:20.524
What did you find out
at the landfill?

34:20.526 --> 34:22.159
They had a break-in.

34:22.161 --> 34:24.127
Security cameras?
No.

34:24.129 --> 34:26.229
Not much there worth protecting.

34:26.231 --> 34:27.731
Boss, do you remember
that night?

34:27.733 --> 34:29.366
May 2, 2011?

34:29.368 --> 34:30.600
No.

34:30.602 --> 34:32.069
Bet you do.

34:32.071 --> 34:34.738
It's the night
navy seals killed bin laden.

34:40.278 --> 34:42.546
So we raid abbottabad,

34:42.548 --> 34:44.748
And we kill the most
wanted man in the world.

34:46.150 --> 34:47.851
Got to think homeland
put the dc area

34:47.853 --> 34:49.686
On high alert
and increased surveillance.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.254
Ziva:
Yeah.

34:51.256 --> 34:52.823
They have to be concerned
about retaliation.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.560
Linder:
I should get some credit.

34:56.562 --> 34:58.228
I fired justin last June.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.629
The damage was done
by then, linder.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.865
And, as assistant director
of operations, you're going

35:01.867 --> 35:04.434
To be held responsible.
(phone rings)

35:04.436 --> 35:05.435
Winter.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.204
Hey, it's gibbs.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.406
Secret service
is under homeland now.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.874
Let me guess, agent gibbs.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.609
You need something.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.411
We need to access

35:14.413 --> 35:17.147
Archival satellite surveillance
of the dc area.

35:17.149 --> 35:18.381
(whispering):
What's going on?

35:19.317 --> 35:21.384
I'll make some calls.

35:32.597 --> 35:35.465
I can give you a ride
to the airport.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.601
Ah, no, no, you're...

35:37.603 --> 35:39.669
You're already late for work.

35:49.347 --> 35:51.414
Sorry things didn't work out.

35:52.717 --> 35:54.317
Me, too.

36:03.427 --> 36:06.296
Bye, junior.

36:16.774 --> 36:19.209
Gibbs:
Can you enhance it?

36:19.211 --> 36:20.510
It's nighttime, gibbs.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.845
We can try.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.482
Going in tighter and enhancing.

36:27.251 --> 36:29.653
Sorry I'm late, boss.

36:29.655 --> 36:30.820
Your dad?

36:30.822 --> 36:34.858
Yeah, well, we hit
a little bump in the road.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.960
Oh, no, but he can't miss
the christmas eve party.

36:36.962 --> 36:39.196
Sorry, abbs.

36:39.198 --> 36:40.664
Where is he?

36:40.666 --> 36:43.533
He is on his way
to the airport.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.469
He's going back
to new york.

36:50.608 --> 36:52.209
Mcgee:
It's a little better.

36:53.411 --> 36:56.413
Well, it looks like a pickup
truck, but because of the

36:56.415 --> 36:57.681
Lack of light
and angle, I can't get

36:57.683 --> 36:59.316
A read on the license plate.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.784
Uh, I don't need it.

37:07.825 --> 37:10.427
(door opens)

37:10.429 --> 37:11.695
Hey!

37:11.697 --> 37:14.497
Ncis. Merry christmas.

37:14.499 --> 37:16.299
You're closing
early today, gillespie.

37:16.301 --> 37:17.968
I am?

37:17.970 --> 37:20.570
We have a warrant to search
the premises and your residence.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.305
What are you looking for?

37:22.307 --> 37:25.575
Uncirculated
$100 treasury notes.

37:25.577 --> 37:26.876
Tony:
Merry christmas, gentlemen.

37:26.878 --> 37:28.511
Drinks are on the house.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.313
Wait, what
are you doing?

37:30.315 --> 37:31.581
(sighs)

37:32.717 --> 37:35.018
This photo was taken
at a virginia landfill

37:35.020 --> 37:37.254
The night
the money went missing.

37:38.723 --> 37:40.590
Looks a lot like your truck.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.892
Just your luck big brother
was watching that night.

37:42.894 --> 37:45.629
The two figures--
you and justin cannady?

37:47.298 --> 37:49.466
Or did cannady do it alone
'cause he was broke

37:49.468 --> 37:53.036
He sell some of his share
to huffner without telling you?

37:55.773 --> 37:57.607
Is that why
you killed them?

37:57.609 --> 37:59.676
You worried that they
were gonna blow it for you?

37:59.678 --> 38:01.611
No, uh...

38:01.613 --> 38:03.513
Hey!
Retired marine?

38:03.515 --> 38:04.848
Yeah, so?

38:04.850 --> 38:06.850
You had access
to the base at pax river.

38:06.852 --> 38:09.319
We'll get the video,
and we'll place you there.

38:09.321 --> 38:11.588
Once we find the money,
it will all fall into place.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.290
Tony:
Look, we can do this
the easy way

38:13.292 --> 38:16.426
Or the hard way, but we're not
leaving here without the money.

38:21.999 --> 38:25.535
Oh, is she getting warmer,
gillespie?

38:26.637 --> 38:28.371
Oh...

38:28.373 --> 38:31.308
That got
your attention.

38:35.680 --> 38:39.783
There's a safe
in my office closet.

38:39.785 --> 38:42.919
Stealing the money
your idea?

38:42.921 --> 38:45.755
It sure as hell wasn't that
drunk justin cannady's idea.

38:45.757 --> 38:48.792
Yeah, but you needed him
to pull it off. Ziva?

38:48.794 --> 38:51.828
There's a safe
in the closet.

39:01.939 --> 39:04.007
Come on.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.377
(sighs)

39:07.379 --> 39:08.812
Hey, you know,
we can wrap this up

39:08.814 --> 39:10.647
And still have time
for the screening in mtac.

39:10.649 --> 39:11.915
I'm really not in the mood.

39:11.917 --> 39:14.117
Come on, tony,
it'll cheer you up.

39:14.119 --> 39:16.853
Yeah, I left the dvd
in my apartment anyway.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.555
So go get it.

39:44.014 --> 39:46.082
(sighs)

40:06.470 --> 40:08.538
♪

40:23.554 --> 40:25.622
(sighs)

40:29.727 --> 40:33.163
Not only were we able to recover
several million dollars

40:33.165 --> 40:35.532
Of stolen,
uncirculated currency,

40:35.534 --> 40:38.635
But two murders were solved
in the process.

40:38.637 --> 40:39.836
Are there any questions?

40:39.838 --> 40:41.004
Yeah, I got one.

40:41.006 --> 40:43.873
You get any help from ncis?

40:43.875 --> 40:46.109
Can you believe it?
She did not even mention us.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.711
Ah, it's christmas,
ziva-- let it go.

40:48.713 --> 40:50.180
Our gift to her.
(laughs)

40:50.182 --> 40:53.550
Yes, the mulled cider
is good this year,

40:53.552 --> 40:55.452
But it's not
quite the same.

40:55.454 --> 40:56.953
I tried to remember
how tony made it.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.589
Maybe I left something out.

40:59.591 --> 41:02.459
Probably the seven
pods of cardamom?

41:03.461 --> 41:05.028
Don't even know
what that is, tony.

41:05.030 --> 41:07.697
Neither do I, to
tell you the truth.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.132
Sorry I'm late.

41:09.134 --> 41:11.901
I got distracted.

41:11.903 --> 41:13.937
Even when he's not around,

41:13.939 --> 41:16.039
Senior can have
an effect on me.

41:16.041 --> 41:19.175
Look what I found
under the tree.

41:19.177 --> 41:21.778
Oh, the family ring.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.079
Mm-hmm.

41:23.081 --> 41:25.582
It's beautiful.

41:26.584 --> 41:29.519
That's why he was here.

41:29.521 --> 41:32.755
He wanted to make amends,
and I blew it.

41:34.091 --> 41:35.692
(door buzzes)
that's abby.

41:35.694 --> 41:37.827
May I see it?

41:37.829 --> 41:39.696
Yeah. It's got
a diamond.

41:39.698 --> 41:40.930
You know, the origin

41:40.932 --> 41:42.832
Of signet rings
dates back

41:42.834 --> 41:45.068
To ancient mesopotamia.

41:45.070 --> 41:48.238
Royalty used them to
authenticate and seal documents.

41:52.676 --> 41:54.177
Hope you didn't start
the movie yet.

41:55.613 --> 41:59.048
Got something
for you, dinozzo.

41:59.050 --> 42:01.050
Thanks, gibbs.

42:03.988 --> 42:06.890
Merry christmas, everyone.

42:06.892 --> 42:09.792
Hey, dad.

42:14.765 --> 42:17.667
Thanks.

42:20.004 --> 42:22.071
Merry christmas.

42:27.611 --> 42:30.313
I love you.
