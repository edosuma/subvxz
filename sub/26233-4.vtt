00:14.014 --> 00:15.181
HOST OF 150 MINUTES WITH GRETA

00:15.265 --> 00:18.101
[Bruce] All right, Dr. Greta,
let's fix this marriage.

00:19.978 --> 00:20.812
Hmm.

00:25.191 --> 00:28.611
SHE'S OFTEN TELLING YOU WHAT SHE NEEDS.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.948
YOUR JOB AS HER HUSBAND IS TO HEAR IT.

DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES

00:41.458 --> 00:44.419
NOW SERVING

00:45.378 --> 00:46.296
Oh, that's me.

00:46.755 --> 00:47.797
Excuse me.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.175
Excuse me. That's me.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.644
Oh, uh, that's okay.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.730
I'm gonna wait for her. You go ahead.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.861
How can I help you, dear?

01:09.944 --> 01:11.988
I am here to report a dangerous driver.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.200
This is form DS-7, including my anecdote.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.410
My kids play on that street.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.330
You don't have the name and address
of the driver.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.290
Well, if I had his name and his address,

01:22.373 --> 01:25.418
I'd go over to his house
and I'd have dealt with him myself.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.504
You really shouldn't do that.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.256
This is his license plate number.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.092
Can you get any stuff from that?

01:32.383 --> 01:35.678
Well, I'm not allowed
to give you that information, hon,

01:35.762 --> 01:38.389
but I could file a report.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.266
-[beep]
-[typing]

01:42.393 --> 01:44.395
I don't know if you really wanna
bother with this,

01:44.479 --> 01:46.564
because they take such a long time.

01:47.273 --> 01:51.861
Yeah, I'm seeing his address now,
so I can submit this thing.

01:51.945 --> 01:52.779
You know what?

01:53.488 --> 01:56.032
Now that I'm here actually doin' it,

01:56.116 --> 01:57.408
I feel like a snitch.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.618
And I ain't one.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.121
But thanks. You've been helpful.

02:15.635 --> 02:16.511
How'd it go? [sighs]

02:18.680 --> 02:20.265
Failed the written again.

02:21.683 --> 02:22.892
I'm sorry, babe.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.144
Next time.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.688
Hey, wanna get a doughnut
at Lucky's or somethin'?

02:27.230 --> 02:32.652
No, I wanna go to 534 Ashton Place.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.529
You don't need a map.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.198
You married Magellan.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.325
Uh-huh.

02:39.742 --> 02:40.577
Hey...

02:41.703 --> 02:43.454
what baby wants, baby gets.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.334
Fudgin' seat belt.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.837
-You okay?
-Yeah, it's stiff. You know. -Go all the way back...
-Yeah.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.757
-...and pull it.
-No, I know.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.051
534 Ashton Place.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.096
On a need-to-know basis.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.058
Eight minutes, tops.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.519
[Linda] Oh, in your dreams, Bruce.

03:06.603 --> 03:09.689
[Bruce] I'm gonna put it on sport mode,
Mario Andretti...

03:11.191 --> 03:13.943
-[Linda] Oh!
-[Bruce] There we are. There we are.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.321
All right, eight minutes.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.072
-We did it.
-[sighs]

03:18.156 --> 03:19.699
-Perfect!
-Okay.

03:20.825 --> 03:21.951
[Bruce] I'm just a guy

03:22.035 --> 03:24.454
-who knows his way around.
-[Linda] Ooh, Brucie, pull there.

03:25.079 --> 03:26.039
-Here?
-Park there.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.333
Okay.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.503
-[Linda gasps]
-Here we go.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.130
Them sons of bitches.

03:35.882 --> 03:36.716
Wait.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.639
[Linda] When we go in there,
you're gonna distract them.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.225
What? Distract who? The guys in the store, Bruce.

03:48.561 --> 03:50.897
It's August, it's 98 degrees.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.774
Why are we going to a fur store?

03:52.857 --> 03:55.526
Just... Go on. Here, go ahead. Go.

03:57.695 --> 04:00.073
[Linda] It's a different guy.
It's not them.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.449
He's a salesperson.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.660
[man] Welcome to Furs by Sebastian.

04:04.118 --> 04:04.953
I'm him.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.454
How can I help you today?

04:07.872 --> 04:08.706
Uh...

04:09.791 --> 04:13.002
I'm-- I'm looking for something to wear...

04:14.087 --> 04:16.005
uh, to the opera.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.632
Is your bathroom in the back?

04:17.715 --> 04:18.883
Oh, right here, hon.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.760
-Okay, I'm just gonna...
-Uh...

04:20.843 --> 04:23.304
-Where... Where are... uh...
-You're just in time.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.348
Our summer sale is just ending.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.142
Take a look over here.
See what speaks to you.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.647
I think you'd look
really stunning in a mink.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.818
You don't choose a fur. It chooses you.
Take a look.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.830
[man] Hold on, Lance. I'm sendin' a fax.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.506
[beeping]

04:58.589 --> 05:00.174
[door opens]

05:00.258 --> 05:01.676
PRIVATE

05:07.598 --> 05:08.516
Wendy!

05:09.392 --> 05:10.601
Hey, girl.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.021
We're gonna get you out of here.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.023
-Oh, good girl. Come on.
-[squeaking]

05:15.106 --> 05:17.525
-[beeping]
-[door opens]

05:25.908 --> 05:28.161
[sighs] Sam Beckett.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.829
[clicking tongue] What a babe. [toilet flushes]

05:31.581 --> 05:32.707
Oh, my God.

05:33.958 --> 05:34.876
[man coughs]

05:35.918 --> 05:37.754
That's one way to lose five pounds.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.089
[first man] Oof. Shut the door.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.175
-Oh, it fuckin' stinks, Lance.
-[door slams]

05:42.258 --> 05:43.217
Light a match.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.261
What kind of car you drivin' out there?

05:45.636 --> 05:46.679
It's, uh...

05:46.763 --> 05:48.014
It's a-- it's a Volvo,

05:48.097 --> 05:50.016
but at, uh, home I got a...

05:51.100 --> 05:51.934
Corvette.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.604
Very nice. Very diverse.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.522
It's a goof, it's fun. I don't know.

05:56.981 --> 05:57.857
And, Lance...

05:58.441 --> 06:01.527
you can't put the code for the door
on the door.

06:01.986 --> 06:04.489
You see that? That's 20 fuckin' grand.

06:04.572 --> 06:08.201
It's got 31 transverse rings on its tail.
Do you know how fuckin' rare that is?

06:08.284 --> 06:09.369
[Lance] It's not a hat yet.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.537
-When's Dad guttin' that thing?
-[Lance] Tomorrow.

06:11.954 --> 06:14.791
We have rehearsal.
It's the only time Joey and Matt are free.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.211
-Can't they learn the routine separately?
-You fuckin' kidding me?

06:18.294 --> 06:20.505
-This shit has to be coordinated.
-[squeaks]

06:20.588 --> 06:21.464
Do you hear that?

06:21.547 --> 06:23.424
[Lance] It's the sound it makes
when it's hungry.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.842
-I thought...
-Shut up, I'm right.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.136
-Just give it a V8.
-[Lance] What?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.263
[first man] Seriously. It's an old trick.

06:30.723 --> 06:31.849
[Wendy squeaking]

06:31.933 --> 06:32.975
No, the fridge.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.147
-[opens can]
-No, pour it in a glass.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.441
Do you want it to cut its little tongue?

06:40.858 --> 06:43.027
Lemurs have very delicate inner systems.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.823
And then just bring it over to me
because I made that up, shithead.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.324
[splash]

06:49.409 --> 06:50.910
[Lance] Bottoms up, funny guy.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.620
Fucking foreskin.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.789
Oh, that is good.

06:55.039 --> 06:58.209
Now, let's try this, okay?
Five, six, seven, eight.

06:58.292 --> 06:59.377
<i>♪ Baby ♪</i>

06:59.794 --> 07:02.672
<i>♪ Give me just a little taste</i>
<i>Of your love ♪</i>

07:04.882 --> 07:05.800
Crisp.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.137
Let's see what you got, Lance.
Get your head in the game.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.097
Finding your hips. Okay? Go!

07:11.180 --> 07:12.890
One, two, three.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.685
Hair. Kick, pull, change.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.395
Down. Up.

07:17.478 --> 07:18.938
I got a feeling about you.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.358
You might be the kind of guy...

07:22.984 --> 07:26.612
who might be interested
in bulletproof furs.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.783
Is that something
that sparks your imagination?

07:31.909 --> 07:32.785
Uh...

07:33.828 --> 07:34.662
I don't know.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.415
[Sebastian] Comes in very handy.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.669
-[Linda] Honey, we have to go now.
-Oh, yeah. Uh...

07:43.546 --> 07:45.381
Thank you. We'll think about it, really.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.883
The sale's ending today.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.260
Maybe your wife will let you
come back later?

07:49.343 --> 07:50.386
-[Bruce] Hah.
-Oh.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.180
You look better in leather. [laughs]

07:52.763 --> 07:54.765
-Now, honey.
-All right. Well, hey...

07:54.974 --> 07:55.850
-thank you.
-Thank you.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.477
We're open till eight.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.937
-Come on.
-I... I'm gonna think about it. Sorry.

08:00.021 --> 08:03.149
I gotta tell you,
I really liked the way I felt in that.

08:03.232 --> 08:06.694
[sighs] All right, Sheila,
we struck out again.

08:07.528 --> 08:08.488
Back we go.

08:09.989 --> 08:10.823
[sighs]

08:10.907 --> 08:12.283
You need to spill it, babe.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.576
Spill what?

08:14.494 --> 08:16.162
What the hell is goin' on?

08:17.371 --> 08:18.206
[sighs]

08:20.458 --> 08:21.542
They have Wendy.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.212
Who the fudge is Wendy?

08:24.295 --> 08:25.379
Nan's lemur.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.256
Who the fudge is Nan?

08:27.340 --> 08:28.841
She... Remember?

08:28.925 --> 08:31.511
The woman that I was taking care of
at work.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.012
With stomach cancer.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.972
Who died yesterday morning.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.475
Hold on, rewind more.

08:38.142 --> 08:41.187
I told you that Nan and I
had a special connection, right?

08:41.729 --> 08:43.814
So yesterday, on her deathbed,

08:44.565 --> 08:46.359
Nan tells the doctor to get out,

08:46.442 --> 08:50.571
and she asks me to take her lemur
and deliver it to her daughter.

08:51.405 --> 08:54.492
-Wasn't her daughter there?
-No, they're estranged, Bruce.

08:54.575 --> 08:57.620
And Nan, that lemur
just meant so much to her,

08:57.703 --> 09:02.166
and she wanted to give it to her daughter
as a gesture of reconciliation.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.459
So...

09:04.460 --> 09:08.089
you agreed to deliver a lemur...

09:09.924 --> 09:12.093
-from a dying woman...
-Mm-hm.

09:12.176 --> 09:15.513
-...to her estranged daughter?
-Yes.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.390
So these two guys

09:17.765 --> 09:20.601
come into the hospice two days ago,

09:20.685 --> 09:23.354
and they asked Nan to buy the lemur.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.022
So Nan tells them to scram,

09:25.648 --> 09:28.234
and then yesterday, Nan passes,
God rest her soul,

09:28.317 --> 09:31.654
so I take Wendy, and I get ready
to go find the daughter,

09:31.737 --> 09:33.823
but then, you know, my bladder.

09:33.906 --> 09:37.618
And so I go in to pee at Bagel Boss
for two minutes.

09:37.994 --> 09:43.124
Next thing I know, this fuckin' van
is screeching away, with Wendy.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.917
And thank God
I got the license plate number.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.878
-That is fudging disrespectful.
-It is.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.089
-While you're peeing in Bagel Boss.
-I know.

09:50.506 --> 09:54.260
And now, tomorrow morning,
they're gonna turn Wendy into a hat.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.929
[Bruce] Why didn't you tell me
any of this?

09:57.013 --> 09:58.347
Because I fucked it up.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.766
Like I always do.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.395
-You didn't fudge it up.
-Oh.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.649
You found it, just now.

10:08.733 --> 10:12.028
And let's call the cops
and clear this whole thing...

10:12.111 --> 10:14.530
No. Bruce, I can't call the cops.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.198
This is an illegal lemur.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.035
If they take her, they're gonna ship her
back to Madagascar.

10:19.118 --> 10:22.705
Plus, Nan told me that it had to be me.

10:22.997 --> 10:23.956
Only me.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.292
She was very specific on that point.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.504
I just...

10:30.588 --> 10:31.464
Ugh.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.136
We gotta break into that store.

10:38.095 --> 10:38.929
Tonight. Really?

10:43.142 --> 10:44.226
You're gonna help me?

10:44.769 --> 10:46.771
-Of course I'll help you.
-Aww!

10:48.105 --> 10:49.523
You don't think I'm bonkers?

10:51.067 --> 10:54.028
That's why I married you, babe.
You're a force of nature.

10:54.820 --> 10:55.780
[sneezes]

10:56.489 --> 10:57.365
Bless you.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.492
There was a chinchilla in there.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.160
Do I have anything in there?

11:01.243 --> 11:03.204
A big beautiful brain,
that's all I see up there.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.289
[chuckles]

11:05.748 --> 11:07.667
[girl] What did the Buddha say
when he walked up

11:07.750 --> 11:10.544
-to the hot dog vendor?
-[Bruce] What?

11:11.045 --> 11:13.881
Make me one with everything.

11:13.964 --> 11:14.965
[Linda] Okay.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.926
Good night. Be good.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.845

-[Linda] Okay.

22:41.568 --> 22:44.112

-[Bruce] Oh, yeah.

23:18.647 --> 23:19.981
Want me to go in with you?

23:21.149 --> 23:23.193
No, Nan said it should just be me.

23:25.153 --> 23:26.154
Okay.

23:26.571 --> 23:29.866

23:29.950 --> 23:31.535
I don't find any of this weird.

24:10.323 --> 24:11.366
You Paula?

24:14.327 --> 24:15.537
Is that Wendy?

24:16.496 --> 24:17.330
Yeah.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.250
-[Paula] You realize what time it is?
-I...

24:20.333 --> 24:21.334
I'm sorry.

24:22.043 --> 24:23.086
[Paula] Come in.

24:25.547 --> 24:26.381
[Wendy coos]

24:27.215 --> 24:29.342
Thank you. Okay. [grunts]

24:42.731 --> 24:44.024
[Linda] I like your Hummels.

24:44.107 --> 24:45.942
[Paula] Do you take your coffee black?

24:46.943 --> 24:49.237
I should tell you why I'm here.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.991
[Paula] Honey, you don't know
why you're here.

24:54.618 --> 24:55.660
Y-yes, I do.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.205
Your mother explained it to me.

25:00.040 --> 25:03.627
She said that you and her
had had your problems,

25:04.586 --> 25:06.963
but as a gesture of reconciliation,

25:07.714 --> 25:09.424
she wanted to give you this lemur.

25:11.134 --> 25:12.010
Her lemur.

25:13.553 --> 25:14.638
Why?

25:18.517 --> 25:20.143
You know, I think it...

25:21.603 --> 25:23.730
It's her way of telling you she loved you.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.065
No.

25:25.815 --> 25:27.484
That's not an "I love you" lemur.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.611
That's a "go fuck yourself" lemur.

25:29.945 --> 25:30.779
Um...

25:32.030 --> 25:34.324
-Sorry?
-[Paula] Got this in the mail yesterday.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.494
"Dear Paula,

25:38.036 --> 25:39.204
I'm close to dyin' now,

25:39.287 --> 25:42.040
and I've been thinkin'
of that terrible argument we had.

25:42.457 --> 25:43.583
Tempers flared,

25:43.833 --> 25:45.669
you said things I'm sure you regret,

25:46.086 --> 25:48.338
but now that death
may separate us forever,

25:48.421 --> 25:50.966
maybe you'll finally
come to your senses and realize

25:51.049 --> 25:52.968
lemurs are better than human children.

25:54.261 --> 25:55.345
Here are the reasons why.

25:55.428 --> 25:58.098
One, lemurs don't talk back.

25:58.181 --> 26:00.100
Two, lemurs aren't selfish.

26:00.183 --> 26:03.186
Three, lemurs don't destroy
what you hope to make of yourself."

What the fudge?

26:19.661 --> 26:21.830
-[Paula] "Lemurs like to cuddle."
-What was that?

26:21.913 --> 26:24.958
[Paula] "And five, lemurs are not capable
of operating large vehicles

26:25.041 --> 26:26.668
or heavy machinery.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.632
A lemur will bring you far more joy
than a child ever will.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.301
Please take Wendy

26:34.384 --> 26:37.345
and avoid makin' the same mistake
I made by havin' you.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.222
Love, your mother Nan." Maybe she's right.

26:46.021 --> 26:46.980
[Paula] I'm sorry?

26:49.941 --> 26:51.651
Maybe you shouldn't have children.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.284
I don't know who you are,

27:00.327 --> 27:03.413
but you seem like exactly
the kind of person my mother would send.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.707
How wonderful that she found you.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.251
But you're too late.

27:08.918 --> 27:10.128
I'm already pregnant.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.048
In 22 weeks I'll be havin' a baby boy.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.008
Congratulations. I'm gonna name him Greg.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.971
Greg "Fuck U Nan" Nazlund.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.599
I think it's a fittin' tribute to a woman

27:22.682 --> 27:25.185
who wanted a fuckin' lemur
more than she wanted me.

27:33.193 --> 27:34.110
[door closes]

27:39.449 --> 27:40.700
What happened?

27:41.826 --> 27:44.162
-She didn't want Wendy.
-[Bruce] No!

27:44.245 --> 27:46.623
That's not gonna fly.
I'm goin' in there, I'll talk to her.

27:46.956 --> 27:50.210
-No, Bruce, don't.
-No, that is not gonna fly.

27:50.627 --> 27:54.089
Not after everything you did to get here.
I'm going in there, I'm gonna give her

27:54.172 --> 27:55.632
-a piece of my mind.
-Don't!

27:58.218 --> 27:59.094
Sorry. I'm sorry.

28:24.577 --> 28:25.745
This one mornin'...

28:27.288 --> 28:29.165
It was back when we lived upstate.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.376
[Wendy chattering]

28:31.459 --> 28:33.461
My sister and I woke up, and...

28:34.546 --> 28:35.755
no one was home.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.591
Not my mom...

28:39.342 --> 28:40.427
not my dad...

28:42.011 --> 28:43.471
The whole house was empty.

28:45.348 --> 28:47.392
And my sister got scared.

28:47.475 --> 28:48.560
[Wendy chirps]

28:51.229 --> 28:52.856
And so I took her hand and...

28:53.940 --> 28:55.358
I said no problem.

28:58.194 --> 28:59.654
We'd go out and find 'em.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.282
Like an adventure.

29:06.244 --> 29:07.203
And so...

29:08.830 --> 29:10.290
we went out and we started...

29:11.124 --> 29:12.542
walkin' down this driveway.

29:12.625 --> 29:16.171
You know, we had that long driveway
that went on for almost a mile?

29:16.254 --> 29:17.422
Mm.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.634
And after a while, I saw my dad's...

29:23.011 --> 29:24.971
old gray pickup truck.

29:25.972 --> 29:28.391
And I could see it was on
because of the exhaust.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.310
[Wendy chirps]

29:31.978 --> 29:34.647
And as we got closer...

29:37.192 --> 29:41.321
I could see it was just one person
in the car, in the driver's seat.

29:43.156 --> 29:44.824
I could see it was just my dad.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.119
In the front... sittin' there.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.294
I saw that he was cryin'.

29:57.420 --> 29:59.881
[sighs deeply]

30:00.298 --> 30:01.508
He was crying, and he...

30:03.343 --> 30:05.011
saw me in the rear-view.

30:09.182 --> 30:10.600
When I looked at his eyes...

30:13.144 --> 30:14.354
I knew right away...

30:15.480 --> 30:17.357
that my mom was either dead...

30:18.441 --> 30:20.151
or gone forever.

30:21.611 --> 30:22.487
Somethin'.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.784
And I had my sister's hand...

30:30.328 --> 30:31.704
'cause all I cared about...

30:33.039 --> 30:34.541
was keepin' her away.

30:37.335 --> 30:38.461
And she stopped. And I just said...

30:43.758 --> 30:44.717
"Come on.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.511
Let's go back and let's...

30:47.470 --> 30:48.555
make a cake.

30:50.765 --> 30:52.475
We'll pretend it's your birthday."

30:52.976 --> 30:53.935
And she...

30:55.186 --> 30:59.190
She looked up at me,
and she said, "Okay."

31:02.735 --> 31:04.696
And we walked back and we made a cake.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.368
[Bruce] When did they get back together?

31:11.786 --> 31:12.704
