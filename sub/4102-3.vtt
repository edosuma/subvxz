Multiple victims over time,

15:01.067 --> 15:03.991

bodies wouldn't be discovered.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.873
There would only be one
possible explanation.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.956
- What is that?
- They're honing their skills.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.247
- Honing their skills?
- Yes.

This was not humans but dogs.

- Sure.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.702
Well, I knew the newspaper
biz was in the weeds,

15:48.865 --> 15:50.833
but getting a corporate
card knocked back...

15:50.992 --> 15:53.290

now it's saying to cut up the card.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.172
No, no, no.

All right. Okay.
Suppose we can use one of mine.

I'm sure The Telegraph
will reimburse me.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.014
Right?

16:11.554 --> 16:14.057
This trip has nothing to do
with The Telegraph, does it?

16:14.223 --> 16:16.851
It did. And then it didn't.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.986
Because I was fired.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.273
I spent my last 800 dollars
getting us here. I'm sorry.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.489
I know I shouldn't have lied to
you, but I did it for a good reason.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.028
Yeah.
That's the problem with you.

A really long one.

that could eventually lead

16:59.977 --> 17:01.229
A Nobel Prize?

17:01.395 --> 17:03.523
Okay, maybe not a Nobel
Prize, but.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.907
But a different kind of prize.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.945

feel really good about yourself.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.416
Come on, Mitch. Can l...?

17:14.575 --> 17:16.452
Can I at least show
you something first?

17:25.336 --> 17:28.886
The pilot sent an SOS
beacon on our way down.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.723
We can expect a rescue.
But who knows in how long.

How do hundreds of bats

How far do you think it is
to my father's compound?

17:49.652 --> 17:52.781
From the plane,
maybe three kilometers.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.455
We could make it there and
back before the rescue arrives.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.494

survived the crash.

Ms. Blanchard, thank you for
taking the time to come down.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.794
I was surprised
to get your call.

Well, most death row
inmates, in the end,

conscience before execution.

liked to have thanked her.

Well,
from everything you told me,

19:22.787 --> 19:25.961
that was the best thing that
could have happened to all of you.

But what if we were
wrong and he was right?

19:29.210 --> 19:32.180
Is it possible that we were
looking at the situation all wrong?

19:32.797 --> 19:34.845
What we thought was a
man on the edge of sanity

19:35.007 --> 19:38.011
was actually a man on the verge
