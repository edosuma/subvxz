WEBVTT

00:00.365 --> 00:01.886
I'm going to break you

00:01.911 --> 00:03.668
and watch you hunt each
other to the death.

00:03.693 --> 00:05.093
Aah!

00:05.118 --> 00:07.694
Errol's bracelets can
deliver up to 1,000 volts

00:07.718 --> 00:10.134
of just the touch of a single button.

00:12.316 --> 00:13.725
Must be a short circuit.

00:13.750 --> 00:15.450
Jess!

00:22.447 --> 00:23.868
Ahh!

00:26.119 --> 00:27.860
What up, hookers?

00:27.885 --> 00:29.397
This is my sister Caitlin L.,

00:29.422 --> 00:31.694
and this is my sister
Caitlynn with two N's.

00:31.719 --> 00:35.172
If you're here, it's because we
think you've got what it takes

00:35.197 --> 00:38.772
to roll with Phi Gamma Phi.

00:38.797 --> 00:41.417
But we've got one more test for you

00:41.442 --> 00:43.473
before you're officially in.

00:43.794 --> 00:46.173
Hope you bitches are ready
to ride the lightning.

00:46.198 --> 00:48.736
Who's up first?

00:48.761 --> 00:50.994
Oh, my God, Alison.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.356
I can't believe we got into Gamma Phi.

00:53.381 --> 00:55.640
This is literally the
best day of my life.

00:56.460 --> 00:58.759
I mean, it's, like, I can just
see the next four years...

00:58.784 --> 00:59.869
Gamma Phi,

00:59.894 --> 01:01.089
Captain of the color guard team,

01:01.114 --> 01:03.681
graduation, and then,
L.A., here I come.

01:03.705 --> 01:05.096
Oh, my God. Do you think you'll meet

01:05.122 --> 01:06.264
- Nicole Richie?
- Ow!

01:06.289 --> 01:09.663
Probably. I mean, I
will be a publicist.

01:09.688 --> 01:10.972
But the most important thing...

01:10.997 --> 01:12.563
is getting out of Arizona.

01:12.588 --> 01:14.693
And it looks so good having
Gamma Phi on your résumé.

01:14.718 --> 01:15.146
Mm-hmm.

01:15.171 --> 01:17.401
It's like the most prestigious
sorority in the whole country.

01:20.411 --> 01:23.957
Phi Gamma Phi sister till I die!

01:38.036 --> 01:40.074
Babe? Time to wake up.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.068
Hey, buddy, I think you've
slapped her enough.

01:42.093 --> 01:43.899
What if you just let her rest for a bit

01:43.924 --> 01:45.496
and maybe she'll wake up on her own?

01:45.521 --> 01:47.187
Oh, I'm sorry, Owen.

01:47.212 --> 01:49.170
- Are you a doctor?
- Okay.

01:49.195 --> 01:51.395
Are you a doctor?

01:52.613 --> 01:54.112
How about you three numbnuts?

01:54.137 --> 01:55.672
Did you go to med school together?

01:55.697 --> 01:57.370
Todd, you know none of us are doctors.

01:57.395 --> 01:58.758
You're damn right I do!

01:58.783 --> 02:01.384
So shut your non-doctor yaps

02:01.409 --> 02:04.311
and let me slap my wife awake!

02:04.336 --> 02:07.819
Good morning, my little caged beasties.

02:07.844 --> 02:09.377
You son of a bitch.

02:09.401 --> 02:11.885
You're lucky my arms are too
jacked to fit through this cage,

02:11.910 --> 02:13.923
or I'd be choking you out right now!

02:13.948 --> 02:16.349
Oh, yes. Your wife.

02:16.374 --> 02:18.969
Has she recovered from
her little shock?

02:18.994 --> 02:20.604
Well, for your information, she's...

02:20.629 --> 02:22.609
Pbht! Kidding.

02:22.634 --> 02:25.571
I really don't give a goose's
queef about you or your wife.

02:25.596 --> 02:27.548
I'm here because I wish to
speak with your leader.

02:28.208 --> 02:31.714
All right. Don't worry, guys.
He's not gonna break me.

02:31.739 --> 02:33.338
I'm just glad I'm the one
that's gonna have to...

02:33.363 --> 02:35.488
Oh, God, no, not you.

02:36.184 --> 02:38.363
I wish to speak with your leader.

02:39.822 --> 02:42.054
Him, with the mustache.

02:44.012 --> 02:45.812
Steve?!

02:46.031 --> 02:47.927
You think that Steve is the leader?

02:48.108 --> 02:49.908
And why is that so hard to believe?

02:49.933 --> 02:51.029
I don't know.

02:51.054 --> 02:53.144
'Cause you got your
pants on backwards?!

02:53.169 --> 02:55.687
What? Oh, no, not again.

02:55.712 --> 02:58.597
Okay. Well done. One to you.

02:58.622 --> 03:01.289
But to be fair, they look the
same no matter how you...

03:01.314 --> 03:02.956
Oh, no, yours are gray on the...

03:02.981 --> 03:04.466
All right, well...

03:04.491 --> 03:06.370
- Oh! My God!
- Oh, my God!

03:06.395 --> 03:08.305
- Jesus, man.
- You see, Owen,

03:08.330 --> 03:09.735
one quality of a great leader

03:09.760 --> 03:12.448
is being able to admit
when one makes a mistake.

03:12.473 --> 03:14.915
How can I help you, Declan...

03:15.089 --> 03:18.149
other than kill you for
murdering my best friend?!

03:18.174 --> 03:19.899
There it is.

03:19.924 --> 03:22.269
That's why I want to speak with you.

03:23.262 --> 03:24.828
Take him upstairs.

03:25.522 --> 03:28.473
Well, don't worry about me, gang.
Worry about him.

03:28.498 --> 03:30.133
Or what's left of him
after I've done "unh"!

03:30.158 --> 03:32.246
Aah! That's actually hurting my arm!

03:32.271 --> 03:33.970
That's a little tight
on the side there!

03:34.173 --> 03:35.864
What the hell am I supposed to do now,

03:35.889 --> 03:39.983
just sit back and watch
my wife be all... floppy?

03:40.008 --> 03:42.242
I mean... look at her.

03:42.267 --> 03:44.612
Yeah, it's too bad we don't
have any smelling salts.

03:46.628 --> 03:48.916
We might not have smelling salts,

03:48.941 --> 03:50.889
but we've got one better...

03:51.701 --> 03:53.201
Toots!

03:53.226 --> 03:56.593
I wake Jess up like every
night by beefing in bed.

03:56.618 --> 04:00.386
Are you saying that you're
gonna wake her up with a fart?

04:00.411 --> 04:01.711
That's exactly what I'm saying,

04:01.736 --> 04:03.363
unless one of you doctors disapproves.

04:03.388 --> 04:05.795
Hmm? You? Tall doctor? Blondie?

04:05.820 --> 04:07.013
Dr. Quinn?

04:07.038 --> 04:09.244
Scraggle hair? Beard? No? No?

04:09.269 --> 04:10.835
Great!

04:12.446 --> 04:14.639
Then let's fart my wife awake.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.527
Normally, this is the part of the story

04:20.552 --> 04:23.186
where the villain removes
the hero's restraints

04:23.211 --> 04:25.315
to show that he's not afraid of him.

04:25.340 --> 04:27.120
I'd like to see you try.

04:27.145 --> 04:28.709
Aah!

04:30.941 --> 04:35.076
But that's the thing... Steve.

04:35.601 --> 04:38.769
I am afraid of you...

04:38.794 --> 04:40.678
because you're the only person here

04:40.703 --> 04:44.329
that I think could actually kill me.

04:44.354 --> 04:47.804
And, frankly, I'm intrigued.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.425
Well, let's see just how
intrigued you are now.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.764
Aah!

04:52.917 --> 04:55.484
You get how this works, right?

04:55.733 --> 04:57.923
I mean, I'm just gonna
keep shocking you

04:57.948 --> 04:59.039
every time you do that.

04:59.064 --> 05:00.162
I mean, you're... you're
just illustrating

05:00.202 --> 05:01.932
why I didn't take the bracelet
off you in the first place.

05:01.957 --> 05:03.699
Illustrate this, you rich bastard.

05:03.724 --> 05:05.450
Aah!

05:06.180 --> 05:08.362
Are we good?

05:08.387 --> 05:10.837
Okay. I get how it works.

05:11.443 --> 05:14.021
I have a proposal for you, Steve.

05:14.381 --> 05:18.703
But first how about we play a
little gentleman's game...

05:19.229 --> 05:20.852
of chess?

05:23.607 --> 05:25.859
Everybody, zip it! I'm almost ready.

05:25.884 --> 05:28.739
All right, we got to make
it like we usually sleep.

05:28.764 --> 05:30.864
Danny, put her arm around me.

05:31.875 --> 05:34.409
Put the blanket over us.
Come on. Hurry.

05:36.168 --> 05:38.292
All right, shut up! Everybody, shut up!

05:49.721 --> 05:51.235
Ohh!

05:51.260 --> 05:53.855
Come back to me.

05:53.880 --> 05:57.385
Come on, babe. Come on, baby.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.915
Oh, my God!

06:06.940 --> 06:08.541
Hell, yeah, babe!

06:08.566 --> 06:10.599
Come on!

06:11.281 --> 06:13.164
Where... Where am I?

06:13.189 --> 06:14.958
Where are the Caitlins?

06:14.983 --> 06:16.676
Why does it smell like corned beef?

06:16.701 --> 06:17.805
Babe, calm down...

06:17.830 --> 06:19.078
Hey, back away from me!

06:19.103 --> 06:20.908
Relax. It's us... your friends.

06:20.933 --> 06:22.371
My friends?

06:22.396 --> 06:24.381
My friends are Alison,
Tiffany, Tall Tiffany,

06:24.406 --> 06:26.775
and sometimes Kylie, when
she's not being a bitch.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.120
I've never seen any of
you freaks in my life!

06:30.165 --> 06:32.702
Oh, my God.

06:33.353 --> 06:36.150
Her brains are scrambled!

06:38.657 --> 06:40.023
Allie?

06:40.231 --> 06:42.432
Tiff? Tall Tiff?

06:42.457 --> 06:43.757
Where are you?

06:44.254 --> 06:45.920
Seriously, this isn't funny.

06:45.945 --> 06:49.385
Hey, hon, why don't you tell us
the last thing you remember?

06:49.410 --> 06:52.460
Uh, duh. I was standing in
the grand hall of Gamma Phi,

06:52.485 --> 06:55.329
I did a lightning shot,
and then I woke up here.

06:55.584 --> 06:57.084
Is this off-campus?

06:57.109 --> 06:59.374
Now, could someone please
let me out of here?

06:59.399 --> 07:01.523
I have to get ready for the
Cowboys and Indians party.

07:02.190 --> 07:05.691
That's the night we first met.

07:06.212 --> 07:07.879
Oh, God bless.

07:08.001 --> 07:10.047
She thinks she's in college.

07:10.072 --> 07:11.565
That's why she doesn't remember me.

07:11.590 --> 07:13.445
She's gone completely...

07:15.006 --> 07:16.917
pre-Todd.

07:17.053 --> 07:18.720
Let me handle this.

07:20.816 --> 07:24.709
Jess, buck up 'cause
here's the hard truth.

07:24.846 --> 07:26.676
You were in a plane crash.

07:26.701 --> 07:28.489
We landed on a deserted island

07:28.514 --> 07:31.848
where we were captured by
sexually frustrated pirates.

07:31.873 --> 07:33.860
We stole their cruise
ship, but it sank,

07:33.885 --> 07:36.998
and now we're being held captive
by a deranged billionaire

07:37.023 --> 07:38.676
who wants us to hunt each other

07:38.701 --> 07:40.701
so he can watch and
presumably masturbate.

07:40.725 --> 07:43.185
Wait. Karen, no. Karen,
come You're upsetting her.

07:43.211 --> 07:44.006
- Get...
- Okay.

07:45.664 --> 07:47.386
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:47.411 --> 07:49.091
- I'm Owen.
- Hi, Owen.

07:49.116 --> 07:50.703
I'm kinda the leader of the group.

07:50.958 --> 07:53.707
Here's the deal. You're not 19.

07:53.732 --> 07:56.245
You are actually...

07:56.270 --> 07:57.902
30.

08:01.873 --> 08:06.427
Okay, I see what this is
part of the initiation.

08:06.452 --> 08:09.170
Hey, Caitlin L., come out
now, you stupid bitch!

08:09.195 --> 08:10.953
Get me away from these weird townies!

08:12.359 --> 08:16.362
Jess, it's true. See for yourself.

08:17.267 --> 08:18.840
I'm sorry.

08:23.268 --> 08:24.713
Aah!

08:25.280 --> 08:26.915
I'm so old!

08:27.716 --> 08:29.654
Ah, chess.

08:29.679 --> 08:32.881
It truly is a magnificent
game, isn't it?

08:33.150 --> 08:35.365
A thousand strategies
of attack and defense,

08:35.390 --> 08:37.549
all with the same simple goal...

08:37.573 --> 08:40.070
To kill the king.

08:42.097 --> 08:44.946
I'm sure you can relate to
that, can't you, Steve?

08:45.370 --> 08:47.171
But the thing with chess

08:47.196 --> 08:50.137
is you always have to think
five steps ahead to ca...

08:50.161 --> 08:51.756
What does the horsey man do again?

08:51.781 --> 08:52.624
What?

08:52.650 --> 08:55.785
He's faster than the others, but
I can't remember whether...

08:55.810 --> 08:57.889
Does he move forwards and
backwards whenever he likes?

08:57.914 --> 08:59.208
No, that's the rook.

08:59.233 --> 09:00.551
Oh, you mean the castle.

09:00.576 --> 09:03.345
Yeah, no, they don't move.
They're made of brick.

09:03.739 --> 09:05.572
Do you not know how to play chess?

09:05.597 --> 09:07.254
Of course I know how to play chest.

09:07.279 --> 09:10.380
It's not "chest." It's
"chess," with an "s."

09:10.518 --> 09:12.441
I'm pretty sure it's "chest."

09:12.466 --> 09:14.039
Why would it be called "chest"?

09:14.064 --> 09:16.698
Because you get a chest
of treasure when you win!

09:16.812 --> 09:18.063
- What?!
- I'm sick of...

09:18.088 --> 09:20.622
Let's stop mucking around!
I'm making my move.

09:20.851 --> 09:24.824
I pick up and levitate
my priest character.

09:24.849 --> 09:29.562
He then swims through all the
prawns into your castle.

09:29.587 --> 09:31.193
Now, he's an undercover priest,

09:31.218 --> 09:33.952
so he seduces your queen in
the middle of the night,

09:33.977 --> 09:35.294
after a dinner.

09:35.319 --> 09:36.627
Okay.

09:36.652 --> 09:39.086
King me.

09:40.566 --> 09:42.673
Why don't we do a little refresher?

09:42.698 --> 09:45.180
And then we can get back

09:45.205 --> 09:47.330
to our game of chest.

09:47.355 --> 09:48.653
Chess!

09:48.678 --> 09:49.877
Chess!

09:49.902 --> 09:53.111
So, you're telling me
that I live in a condo...

09:53.136 --> 09:55.085
in Scottsdale...

09:55.110 --> 09:56.311
with him?

09:56.911 --> 09:59.474
Hell, yeah, you do. 'Sup?

09:59.499 --> 10:00.765
What about L.A.?

10:00.790 --> 10:02.591
Do I at least do P.R. in Scottsdale?

10:02.616 --> 10:03.815
Kinda.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.339
You were a Red Bull girl

10:05.364 --> 10:07.909
till I drove your car into a Dumpster.

10:07.934 --> 10:09.641
I blew that big old can

10:09.666 --> 10:11.990
right off the top.

10:12.526 --> 10:16.003
So, I basically graduated
college, and I did nothing?

10:16.028 --> 10:17.752
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:17.777 --> 10:19.107
You didn't graduate.

10:19.132 --> 10:21.170
You dropped out and moved
to the 'Dale with me.

10:21.195 --> 10:22.483
- What?!
- Yeah.

10:22.508 --> 10:26.093
I got that sick job offer from
my dad's real-estate company,

10:26.118 --> 10:27.363
and you don't have to work,

10:27.388 --> 10:32.351
so you basically sit around
all day doing nothing.

10:32.376 --> 10:34.075
Oh, my God.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.684
I need to be alone.

10:35.709 --> 10:37.416
No. Wait. Jess!

10:37.441 --> 10:40.034
Oh, my God. She has lost it!

10:40.059 --> 10:42.126
She can't even remember
her kick-ass life!

10:42.603 --> 10:44.418
I just want the old Jess back.

10:48.186 --> 10:50.647
Oh, my God. I can't believe
I didn't see this.

10:50.671 --> 10:53.069
You have to "Notebook" her.

10:54.378 --> 10:56.494
What, like... slap her with one?

10:56.519 --> 10:58.411
- Oh, no.
- What? No. What?

10:58.436 --> 11:00.328
- No!
- The movie.

11:00.353 --> 11:02.797
When old Rachel McAdams
loses her memory

11:02.822 --> 11:05.237
and so then old Ryan Gosling
tells her the story

11:05.262 --> 11:07.329
of how they fell in
love to get it back.

11:07.631 --> 11:09.509
Maybe if you tell her
a story like that,

11:09.534 --> 11:10.897
she'll get her memory back.

11:10.922 --> 11:14.348
That could work. All college
girls love them some "Notebook."

11:14.727 --> 11:16.178
So, think, man.

11:16.203 --> 11:20.238
What's, like, the most
romantic memory you got?

11:20.764 --> 11:22.263
Easy.

11:22.288 --> 11:24.527
My buddy Tug Nut's bachelor party.

11:24.552 --> 11:26.239
He had a Slip 'N Slide on the roof,

11:26.264 --> 11:27.934
landed in a baby pool

11:27.959 --> 11:30.105
full of some naughty
little Jell-O shots.

11:30.130 --> 11:31.146
- What?!
- Yeah.

11:31.171 --> 11:32.708
Was Jess even there?

11:32.733 --> 11:34.044
Well, you didn't say
she had to be there.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.660
- Unh!
- Oh, wow!

11:35.685 --> 11:37.352
Ugh! Of course she has
to be there, Todd!

11:37.377 --> 11:38.319
What do you want?

11:38.344 --> 11:39.473
You want to know about the first time

11:39.498 --> 11:40.984
that I knew that I loved her?

11:41.009 --> 11:41.825
- Yes!
- Yes!

11:41.850 --> 11:43.147
That's literally what we're saying!

11:43.172 --> 11:44.586
- Yes!
- Okay!

11:44.611 --> 11:46.902
Stop shitting yourselves! Okay!

11:46.927 --> 11:49.205
I'll tell you!

11:49.230 --> 11:53.262
It was the first time that I
took her to a golf course.

11:53.287 --> 11:54.920
It was a Sunday.

11:55.819 --> 11:58.707
She looked so beautiful
in that morning light.

11:58.732 --> 12:00.398
Wait.

12:00.423 --> 12:02.915
Don't tell me.

12:03.341 --> 12:05.305
Tell her.

12:05.705 --> 12:07.996
I told you I don't know a "Bennifer."

12:08.021 --> 12:09.903
Well, is Britney still with K-Fed?

12:10.360 --> 12:11.926
'Sup, Jess?

12:11.951 --> 12:13.979
I was wondering if I
could tell you a story,

12:14.004 --> 12:16.413
the story...

12:17.156 --> 12:18.588
of us.

12:18.613 --> 12:22.472
Uh, are you trying to
"Notebook" me right now?

12:24.528 --> 12:26.811
Because I love that movie!

12:26.844 --> 12:28.178
Told you.

12:28.203 --> 12:29.503
Sick.

12:29.639 --> 12:31.277
It was the summer of 2006...

12:32.001 --> 12:34.075
two weeks before we
moved to Scottsdale.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.482
I'd never taken a girl with
me to the golf course before.

12:49.285 --> 12:51.178
One... that's not our song.

12:51.203 --> 12:53.622
Our song is "Blurry" by Puddle Of Mudd.

12:57.212 --> 12:59.959

13:09.522 --> 13:11.785
the perfect club for this shot.

you I loved you, Todd.

to hand me a dang club.

14:08.836 --> 14:10.035
- Oh, one of these clubs?
- Yes.

14:10.060 --> 14:12.431
Huh? Yeah. How about this one, huh?

14:12.456 --> 14:14.156
You're going the wrong way.

It's a lot to take in.

15:37.607 --> 15:39.240
Shhyeah.

15:39.265 --> 15:42.054
I just had this dream of how
my life would turn out.

15:42.079 --> 15:44.232
I'd be a successful publicist.

15:44.257 --> 15:46.309
I'd be married to Mark
Hoppus from blink-182

15:46.334 --> 15:48.952
and have two kids named
Buffy and Angel.

15:49.417 --> 15:51.810
None of it turned out the
way I thought it would.

15:52.358 --> 15:54.488
I had dreams, too.

15:55.201 --> 15:56.715
I figured this would be the year

15:56.740 --> 15:59.715
I'd make Variety's Top
35 Agents Under 35

15:59.740 --> 16:01.859
Without a Sexual Harassment Lawsuit.

16:04.719 --> 16:06.240
What's Variety?

16:06.265 --> 16:09.467
It's just, like, the most important
show-biz magazine in Hollywood.

16:10.037 --> 16:12.103
Everyone who's anyone reads it.

16:12.128 --> 16:13.968

up killing himself

18:03.204 --> 18:04.788

18:04.813 --> 18:07.310
and the only way you're
ever gonna get close enough

18:07.335 --> 18:08.701

20:00.118 --> 20:02.240
Well, nothing much.

stupid game that he made up.

It's about a king and a boobless
queen and some horse people.

20:09.150 --> 20:12.542

20:13.625 --> 20:15.848
that I was the chess state
champion in high school?

20:15.873 --> 20:17.607
It should have been me in there.

20:17.632 --> 20:20.216

able to swipe this?

20:20.298 --> 20:21.597

20:21.622 --> 20:23.518
It's a priest character from the game.

20:23.543 --> 20:25.615
- You mean a bishop?
- Well, yeah, whatever.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.621
My point is, I risked
my life to steal this.

20:28.646 --> 20:30.713
What the hell are we
supposed to do with it?

20:33.686 --> 20:35.722
I don't know. Pick a lock with it or...

20:35.747 --> 20:36.747
- What?!
- Come on!

20:36.772 --> 20:37.649
- Ohh.
- Steve!

20:37.674 --> 20:40.643
Okay. You had no plan? You
just grabbed whatever?

20:40.668 --> 20:42.231
This could be our ticket out of here.

20:42.256 --> 20:45.357
There wasn't anything else
you could have taken?

20:46.630 --> 20:47.996
Yeah.

20:48.021 --> 20:50.580
No, it was a room full
of objects, so...

20:51.031 --> 20:52.206
There was a knife.

20:52.231 --> 20:53.131
What?!

20:53.156 --> 20:54.348
There was a radio in the corner.

20:54.373 --> 20:55.351
- Steve!
- A radio?!

20:55.376 --> 20:56.635
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

20:56.660 --> 20:58.141
And there's the remote

20:58.166 --> 20:59.569
for these buzzy bracelets.

20:59.594 --> 21:00.815
- Come on!
- Oh. Steve.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.698
You're the dumbest person!
