before the coach was hired.

of your coach?

08:44.654 --> 08:46.003
No.

I don't need all the crosstalk.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.601
-Anything else?
-LIZ: Uh, yes.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.168
Just one more thing, Your Honor.

09:20.211 --> 09:24.868
Mr. Camden, in the
Chicago Crows' 100-year history,

09:24.912 --> 09:27.654

25:51.811 --> 25:53.595

25:53.639 --> 25:55.902
BAPTISTE:
No. Defensive units

25:55.945 --> 25:57.904
tend to be more Black
across the league.

25:57.947 --> 25:59.558
And offensive units tend to be

25:59.601 --> 26:01.951
more white at the line

We have very strict

Can you explain how
concussion protocols work?

33:41.497 --> 33:42.759
Yes.

33:42.803 --> 33:44.065
If a player gets hit
in the head,

33:44.109 --> 33:47.068
we test their
cognitive abilities

33:47.112 --> 33:49.288
against a baseline
of tests we perform

33:49.331 --> 33:50.941
before the season starts.

33:50.985 --> 33:54.945
Is there any "race norming"
in these questions?

33:54.989 --> 33:57.861
No, uh, these are just
basic questions

33:57.905 --> 33:59.254

to answer.

33:59.298 --> 34:01.256
What is race norming?

34:01.300 --> 34:02.997
It is a discontinued practice.

When it was in practice,
what was it?

34:05.913 --> 34:08.176
FISHERWOOD:
In cognitive tests

34:08.220 --> 34:12.137
it was the incorrect assumption
that Black players

34:12.180 --> 34:15.749
had lower cognitive abilities
than white players.

34:15.792 --> 34:17.664
So you're saying
the league assumes

34:17.707 --> 34:19.448
Black players are
less intelligent,

34:19.492 --> 34:21.581
and therefore they receive
less treatment

34:21.624 --> 34:23.757
because they have
a lower baseline

34:23.800 --> 34:25.454
-to qualify as injured?
-No.

34:25.498 --> 34:28.805
I'm saying that that is
a-a-an out-of-date practice

34:28.849 --> 34:30.503

Like The Shadow,
My Favorite Husband.

41:41.368 --> 41:42.935
CHARLES:
Oh, I've never heard
My Favorite Husband.

41:42.978 --> 41:44.719
STILTON:
Oh, it's a lot of fun.
Lucille Ball.

41:44.763 --> 41:45.938
And it was the same writer
as Rear Window.

41:45.981 --> 41:47.635
CHARLES:
John Michael Hayes.

41:47.679 --> 41:49.376
STILTON:
You know him.
Did you read the book?

41:49.419 --> 41:51.465
CHARLES: Oh, about his
collaboration with Hitchcock?

41:51.509 --> 41:52.814
STILTON:
What a story.

41:52.858 --> 41:54.381
BOTH:
The Man Who Knew Too Much.

41:54.424 --> 41:56.514
-[Stilton laughing]
-CHARLES: Yes, exactly.

42:00.909 --> 42:02.868
I'm not interested
in a class action suit.

42:03.869 --> 42:07.394
Well, it-it's-it's just a suit
to gain leverage, Mr. Goate.

42:07.437 --> 42:09.962
If we pressure them
with a class action suit,

42:10.005 --> 42:12.007
then they'll be more likely
to settle for Baptiste.

42:12.051 --> 42:13.356
GOATE:
I don't want it.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.358
-Why not?
-Because it's a distraction.

42:15.402 --> 42:17.099
I hired you to represent
Darren Baptiste

42:17.143 --> 42:19.101
in a lawsuit
for racial discrimination.

42:19.145 --> 42:20.320
JAY:
Then let's ask him.

42:20.363 --> 42:21.974
Excuse me?

42:22.017 --> 42:24.063
We represent Baptiste.
Let's ask him what he wants.

42:25.238 --> 42:26.413
Who are you?

42:26.456 --> 42:27.980
He's our investigator.

42:29.938 --> 42:31.157
No.

42:32.332 --> 42:35.509
Do what I pay you to do.
I'll worry about Darren.

42:42.647 --> 42:45.693
He met with the team owners
last night.

42:45.737 --> 42:47.826
What? Why?

42:47.869 --> 42:50.524
My guess is,
he wants to buy the Crows.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.873
RI'CHARD:
Oh, my goodness.

42:51.917 --> 42:53.614
He doesn't want to sue
the league.

42:53.658 --> 42:56.269
He wants to drive down
the asking price on the Crows.

42:56.312 --> 42:57.531
JAY:
Yep.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.577
That's what this is all about.

42:59.620 --> 43:01.753
Baptiste is a Trojan horse
for buying a football team.

43:01.796 --> 43:04.538
But we still represent Baptiste.

43:04.582 --> 43:07.541
Yes, but-but Goate is paying us.

43:07.585 --> 43:10.979
If he gets the team,
he'll hire Baptiste.

43:11.023 --> 43:13.199
All right, then no class action.

43:14.853 --> 43:17.638
So, uh, what do you think?

43:19.074 --> 43:21.337
I think we should prepare
ourselves for trial.

43:21.381 --> 43:22.687
Thank you.

43:22.730 --> 43:24.427
But I thought you two did well.

43:24.471 --> 43:26.691
Yes, but it's easier
for the judge

43:26.734 --> 43:28.344
to send you to trial
than to dismiss.

If I were you,
I would be praying for a trial.

43:35.264 --> 43:36.439
I did my best.

43:36.483 --> 43:38.441
That should be your worry.

43:43.098 --> 43:44.273
Are you gonna be all right?

43:44.317 --> 43:46.188
[sighs]
I think so.

43:46.232 --> 43:49.061
I have a backup plan
if I need it.

43:49.104 --> 43:50.802
BAILIFF:
All rise.

43:53.761 --> 43:54.806
Be seated.

43:56.459 --> 43:58.026
Thank you for your arguments.

43:58.070 --> 44:00.855
I will admit that I am not
a fan of Charles Lester.

44:00.899 --> 44:02.857
He's been in my court before,

44:02.901 --> 44:05.294
representing some of
the lowest of the low.

44:05.338 --> 44:06.382
But...

44:07.514 --> 44:09.908
Mr. A.S.A.,
your evidence is a sham.

44:09.951 --> 44:11.126
Worse than a sham.

44:11.170 --> 44:12.562
I don't know where you got it,

44:12.606 --> 44:13.868
or if you yourself created it...

44:13.912 --> 44:15.653
No, no, I swear,
I did not, Your Honor.

44:15.696 --> 44:17.176
Mr. Callas,
you do yourself no favors

44:17.219 --> 44:18.656
by interrupting my ruling.

44:20.919 --> 44:23.356
This video, this deepfake,

44:23.399 --> 44:25.445
shows the desperation
of the prosecution

44:25.488 --> 44:28.491
to railroad
a possibly guilty man.

44:28.535 --> 44:29.710
But how am I to tell?

44:29.754 --> 44:32.060
I want you to wait by her car.

44:32.104 --> 44:34.541
She may have a gun in the car,
so don't let her get in.

44:34.584 --> 44:36.021
STILTON:
I don't like the way
the defendant has dodged

44:36.064 --> 44:38.023
a deserved punishment
for decades.

44:38.066 --> 44:39.894
I don't like the way
he's manipulated the system

44:39.938 --> 44:41.722
in order to continue
to function as an attorney...

44:41.766 --> 44:43.202
Hello.

44:43.245 --> 44:44.594
Do you need something?

44:44.638 --> 44:46.118

44:46.161 --> 44:50.035
I think we have something

Uh-huh. What's that?

44:51.340 --> 44:52.559
The same lawyer.

Carmen Moyo.

44:55.301 --> 44:58.478
-You're...?
-Oscar Rivi.

44:58.521 --> 45:02.743
And I want to be clear
with you, Mr. Baruch.

45:02.787 --> 45:05.703
If something happen
to my lawyer...

45:07.052 --> 45:08.444
...I won't be happy.

45:08.488 --> 45:12.100
In fact, I'll be very upset.

45:12.144 --> 45:15.408
My business will suffer
without her.

45:15.451 --> 45:18.933
And if my business suffer,

45:18.977 --> 45:20.892
I'll make your business suffer.

45:20.935 --> 45:23.590
You're probably wondering
whether your business

45:23.633 --> 45:26.680
can survive going against me.

45:27.681 --> 45:30.815
I'm guessing it can't.

45:30.858 --> 45:32.686
But why risk it?

45:32.730 --> 45:35.471
If I were you,
I'd leave her alone.

45:35.515 --> 45:37.212
She's a good lawyer.

45:38.257 --> 45:40.302
Do we understand each other?

45:43.175 --> 45:44.350
Good.

45:44.393 --> 45:46.439
I think you need
to tell your man

45:46.482 --> 45:49.355
not to meet her at her car.

45:50.530 --> 45:52.010
Let it go.

45:53.663 --> 45:55.883
[chuckles softly]

45:55.927 --> 45:58.581
Maybe we can do
some business together.

45:59.887 --> 46:01.541
Carmen will arrange it.

46:01.584 --> 46:02.977
STILTON:
And at that moment...

46:03.021 --> 46:04.849
-[chuckles]
-I will surely sentence you

46:04.892 --> 46:07.982
just as harshly
as the law will allow.

46:08.026 --> 46:11.507
Until that time,
you will retain your freedom.

46:11.551 --> 46:13.553
And so,
with these facts in mind,

46:13.596 --> 46:15.947
I have no choice
but to dismiss this case.

46:15.990 --> 46:20.560
Mr. Lester, I would urge you
to find new friends.

46:20.603 --> 46:22.649
Next time, this will
certainly go against you.

46:22.692 --> 46:24.520
Thank you, Your Honor, I will.

46:24.564 --> 46:26.174
No, you won't.

46:26.218 --> 46:28.350
But unfortunately
I have no choice

46:28.394 --> 46:30.352
but to dismiss this trial
under Section 114

46:30.396 --> 46:32.311
of the Illinois Code
of Criminal Procedure:

46:32.354 --> 46:34.530

I-I know you were looking
for more than money,

but, uh, you should talk
to Mr. Goate.

47:24.319 --> 47:26.278
He bought out your former boss,

47:26.321 --> 47:28.193

looking for a coach.

47:28.236 --> 47:30.238
-Thank you.
-Hmm.

47:32.327 --> 47:34.155
You think Goate's
gonna hire him?

47:34.199 --> 47:35.417
No.

47:35.461 --> 47:36.941
He wants the white coach.

47:38.986 --> 47:42.294
So Goate manipulated us
into a do-gooder lawsuit

47:42.337 --> 47:44.905
