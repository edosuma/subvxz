00:05.756 --> 00:09.181
Focus, Deputy, remember
your training. Easy, easy...

00:09.384 --> 00:10.101
(grunts)

00:10.302 --> 00:11.849
You're almost there!

00:12.054 --> 00:13.101
(grunts)

00:13.597 --> 00:15.941
Dang it! I almost
got the treasure!

00:16.558 --> 00:19.687
The time we spend together
is treasure enough.

00:20.395 --> 00:21.521
Hey, you feel that?

00:22.022 --> 00:22.989
( Screams )

00:27.236 --> 00:28.954
Reckon we should report that.

00:29.154 --> 00:32.078
Or go for a ride in
our new convertible!

00:32.448 --> 00:34.497
- Whee!
-( chuckles ) Yeah!

00:36.537 --> 00:37.834
( Screeching )

00:39.289 --> 00:41.041
I ♪

01:19.663 --> 01:22.291
Ladies and gentlemen,
continuing our mystery tour

01:22.499 --> 01:25.048
you'll see the world famous
outhouse of mystery!

01:25.252 --> 01:26.970
-( Gasp )
- Stan: I got stuck in there once!

01:27.296 --> 01:28.548
Could I go to the bathroom?

01:28.755 --> 01:30.473
Save all questions until
after the tour!

01:30.841 --> 01:31.717
(grunts)

01:32.801 --> 01:33.643
( sighs )

01:33.969 --> 01:35.562
And up ahead
if you look really closely,

01:35.762 --> 01:37.810
everybody get your cameras,
you're gonna wanna see this.

01:39.057 --> 01:39.808
(Oinks)

01:40.017 --> 01:42.770
Finally, Waddles! We have
the whole house to ourselves!

01:42.978 --> 01:44.901
What do you think, dance party?

01:45.272 --> 01:46.319
( Snorts twice )

01:46.523 --> 01:48.070
I'm not hearing a no.

02:14.217 --> 02:17.312
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.014
( Sighs, grunts )

02:20.349 --> 02:21.191
( licks )

02:21.391 --> 02:23.143
Uh-oh. Cuddle time!

02:23.352 --> 02:24.399
( Chuckles )

02:25.187 --> 02:27.189
Waddles, can I
tell you a secret?

02:27.397 --> 02:29.900
You're my favorite pig
in the whole world.

02:30.692 --> 02:31.909
( Yawns )

02:32.653 --> 02:34.030
( snores )

02:34.988 --> 02:35.955
( snickers )

02:36.156 --> 02:37.328
( yells, grunts )

02:37.658 --> 02:39.626
Mabel, what are you
doing on the floor?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.203
Being cute and great.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.879
And I thought
your brother was weird.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.252
No. He's more like...

02:44.748 --> 02:46.671
(imitates Dipper)
( shudders ) Let's solve a mystery.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.503
I kiss a pillow with
Wendy's face drawn on it.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.009
( laughs ) That's pretty good.
Kissing a pillow!

02:52.714 --> 02:54.637
Go! Go! Chew that pant leg!

02:54.841 --> 02:56.388
( Gasps, grunts )

02:57.260 --> 02:59.354
All right, outside. Now!

02:59.554 --> 03:01.397
No! Grunkle Stan!

03:01.598 --> 03:03.566
It's not safe
for Waddles outside.

03:03.767 --> 03:06.190
There's predators!
And bar-b-quers.

03:06.395 --> 03:07.487
That's just the natural order.

03:07.646 --> 03:10.149
It's not my fault your pig
is potentially delicious!

03:10.357 --> 03:12.451
He should be inside
like a person!

03:12.651 --> 03:15.029
People don't roll around
in their own filth.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.033
Except for Soos.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.865
And we're the lesser for it.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.167
Maybe we're the ones who should
be put outside.

03:20.367 --> 03:23.712
Huh? Huh? Think about it.
Hmph!

03:25.997 --> 03:27.294
Today is the day, Soos!

03:27.499 --> 03:28.921
Thanks for coming along
on this mission.

03:29.126 --> 03:29.877
Dude, it's an honor!

03:30.085 --> 03:32.929
Today I'm sweating from
heat and excitement! Whew!

03:33.463 --> 03:34.840
Something hiding in these woods.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.846
Something big enough
to rip the roof off a car.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.927
If we get a photo of this thing,
we'll be heroes!

03:39.136 --> 03:40.228
Yeah, we'll get all the babes!

03:40.429 --> 03:42.056
You'll be fending off
smooches with a stick!

03:42.264 --> 03:43.516
( Embarrassed chuckle )
Shut up, man!

03:43.724 --> 03:45.146
With a stick, dude!

03:45.350 --> 03:46.351
Here, gimme a boost.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.031
( Grunts )
Got it. Ugh.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.487
Is sap supposed
to be this sticky? Ugh.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.197
If everything goes
according to plan,

03:55.444 --> 03:56.866
the creature will
grab that steak,

03:57.112 --> 04:00.787
cross through the string,
and set off cameras A, B and C.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.668
And nothing can go wrong!
High five!

04:04.745 --> 04:05.917
( Grunting )

04:06.288 --> 04:07.289
This was poorly planned.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.087
( Roaring )

04:12.043 --> 04:12.794
( Qasps )

04:14.421 --> 04:15.217
Bobby Renzobbi:
Hey, you!

04:15.464 --> 04:16.089
Me?

04:16.298 --> 04:18.050
Bobby Renzobbi: Sick of
constantly dropping your baby?

04:18.257 --> 04:19.053
Man on TV:
Yes!

04:19.301 --> 04:20.517
Hi, I'm Bobby Renzobbi!

04:20.719 --> 04:23.063
And what you need is the
Huggy Wuvvy Tummy Bundle.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.856
I can hold ten babies at once!

04:25.140 --> 04:27.017
I know what you're thinking.
Does it work for pigs?

04:27.225 --> 04:29.478
( Chuckles ) Yeah,
it does works for pigs, stupid!

04:29.686 --> 04:31.313
Feel your pig's heartbeat
next to yours.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.273
It works for pigs!

04:33.690 --> 04:35.112
( Oinks twice )

04:35.317 --> 04:36.990
( gasps )
Grunkle Stan!

04:37.194 --> 04:39.743
I'm off to get a Huggy Wuvvy
Tummy Bundle!

04:39.946 --> 04:42.665
Yeesh. Isn't knitting matching
sweaters for that pig enough?

04:43.450 --> 04:44.542
Nope! Anyway,

04:44.743 --> 04:47.792
I need you to look after this
little gentleman while I'm gone.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.213
( Snorts, chewing )

04:49.414 --> 04:51.416
Not now, kid. I got some
tourists coming through.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.128
Grunkle Stan, I know you're
not crazy about Waddles.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.963
He's a fat, naked jerk.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.548
But you do care about me.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.850
Promise me you
won't let him outside.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.179
Fine. Yeah, yeah. I promise.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.768
Thanks, Grunkle Stan!

05:06.014 --> 05:07.186
(oinking )

05:07.432 --> 05:08.934
I'm watching you, Pig-

05:10.310 --> 05:11.527
'( Oinks)
- Ugh!

05:12.687 --> 05:13.939
We did it! It tripped the wire!

05:14.147 --> 05:16.445
Somewhere in these cameras
is a photo of that creature!

05:16.650 --> 05:17.617
I'll go develop the film!

05:17.818 --> 05:20.617
I'll go make us victory nachos!
Dipper and Soos for life!

05:20.946 --> 05:22.698
- Boosh!
-( chuckles )

05:23.240 --> 05:25.493
And here, ladies and gentlemen,
is our final exhibit.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.828
The most hideous creatures
known to man!

05:29.913 --> 05:31.881
-( laughing )
- Look, it's us!

05:32.082 --> 05:33.880
Right? Right? We,
( chuckle )

05:34.084 --> 05:36.462
we have fun here.
But seriously, folks.

05:36.670 --> 05:41.016
This is something. I present to you,
a unicorn made out of corn,

05:41.258 --> 05:44.933
the Cornicorn! I,
I don't know. I'm tired.

05:45.846 --> 05:46.847
_l_luh?
_( gasp )

05:48.390 --> 05:49.107
What the--

05:49.307 --> 05:50.308
( squeals, chewing )

05:50.517 --> 05:53.145
What a rip off!
Kids! We're leaving!

05:53.979 --> 05:55.731
No! No!

05:56.481 --> 05:58.074
( 9"°Wls )
You!

06:00.569 --> 06:01.991
Come on, come on.

06:03.572 --> 06:04.414
Hmm!

06:05.448 --> 06:07.917
That's a wing! If
camera B got the wing,

06:08.118 --> 06:11.042
then the one that should have
got the rest is...camera C!

06:11.246 --> 06:12.623
( Panting )

06:14.583 --> 06:15.505
The creature!

06:16.293 --> 06:18.512
Who wants victory nachos?

06:19.504 --> 06:20.175
[[511

06:20.589 --> 06:22.683
Dude, don't worry. I only
ate, like, a third of 'em.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.977
Half of 'em. ( chuckles )
I ate all of 'em, dude!

06:28.930 --> 06:32.309
Just ten minutes without this pig
in the house. Is that so much to ask?

06:33.852 --> 06:37.527
There. Mabel asks,
this never happened.

06:38.148 --> 06:41.652
(imitates Mabel) "Oh but, Grunkle Stan,
it's not safe out there! There's predators!"

06:41.902 --> 06:42.778
Oh, brother.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.454

( roars )

06:48.700 --> 06:49.451
Aah!

06:50.118 --> 06:51.244
I can't believe you, man!

06:51.453 --> 06:54.832
Sorry, dude. I was just so excited.
Nachos cause excitement!

06:55.040 --> 06:58.214
Soos, no offense, but you have
got to be more careful sometimes.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.512
I mean, what are the odds
we'll ever get another picture of--

( roaring )

07:10.180 --> 07:12.774
Dude! Did you see that?
That thing was a dinosaur, bro!

07:12.974 --> 07:16.353
How is it possible a dinosaur
survived sixty-five million years?

07:16.561 --> 07:18.814
Did you see it, Mr. Pines?
Mr. Pines?

07:19.189 --> 07:20.987
It, it, it took him.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.613
- Took what?
- The pig.

07:22.901 --> 07:23.948
It took Waddles.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.696
What'd you say about Waddles?

07:27.781 --> 07:30.455
( Chuckles )
Whoa, awkward silence.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.416
Blah!

07:34.037 --> 07:36.916
What's going on? Why are you
standing around all awkwardly?

07:37.123 --> 07:38.045
And where's Waddles?

07:38.249 --> 07:41.344
Um, uh... The good news is,
you're getting a puppy!

07:41.628 --> 07:42.254
What happened?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.305
Well, see, uh, when the, uh--

07:44.506 --> 07:46.474
Your pig got eaten by
a p-terodactyl, bro.

07:46.675 --> 07:49.519
What? Waddles? Waddles!

07:49.719 --> 07:51.642
Where did he go?
How did this happen?

07:51.846 --> 07:53.598
( Panicked breathing )

07:53.890 --> 07:56.393
Grunkle Stan, you didn't
put him outside?

07:56.601 --> 07:59.024
What? ( nervous chuckle )
No! I didn't put him anywhere.

07:59.229 --> 08:02.449
I'm not acting suspicious!
You're acting suspicious! What's a pig?

08:02.649 --> 08:03.650
Then what happened?

08:03.942 --> 08:05.819
Uh, look, it went down
like this, see?

08:06.069 --> 08:07.821
So there I was,
in the living room...

08:09.072 --> 08:12.167
Tenderly nursing him
with only the richest of creams.

08:12.867 --> 08:13.993
When all of a sudden...

08:14.995 --> 08:16.417
( roars )

08:18.415 --> 08:19.507
( frantic oinking )

08:19.708 --> 08:20.504
"Huh?"

08:20.917 --> 08:21.668
So I said,

08:22.877 --> 08:23.799
( screams )

08:24.004 --> 08:25.506
"No dice, cowboy!"

08:25.922 --> 08:27.265
( fighting yell )

08:27.465 --> 08:29.012
I start punching him
right in the face.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.139
(grunts)

08:30.343 --> 08:31.560
But he played dirty!

08:32.220 --> 08:32.890
"Huh?"

08:33.263 --> 08:34.890
( screams, grunts )

08:35.347 --> 08:36.395
That really happened.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.236
Why! Why couldn't you
have taken me!

08:40.437 --> 08:45.068
( Cries )

08:45.942 --> 08:48.786
Oh, Grunkle Stan!
You tried to save him!

08:49.988 --> 08:52.241
Uh, yep! I'm a
great man, all right.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.326
You punched a
pterodactyl in the face?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.377
I thought you didn't even
believe in the supernatural.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.673
Dinosaurs aren't magic, they're just
big lizards. Get off my back!

09:00.415 --> 09:02.042
Oh, Waddles...

09:02.250 --> 09:02.876
( sniffles )

09:03.084 --> 09:05.337
That's it! No pterodactyl
messes with my sister!

09:05.545 --> 09:08.344
We're gonna go out there,
catch him, and save your pig!

09:08.548 --> 09:09.674
For Mabel, guys!

09:09.883 --> 09:10.634
For Mabel!

09:10.842 --> 09:12.765
But how do we even
find the little guy?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.602
( Gasps )
We follow that.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.439
- Oh! Sweet!
- Yes! Genius!

09:20.685 --> 09:23.063
Or, you know, we could
just call it a day maybe,

09:23.354 --> 09:24.776
hit the pool hall or, uh...

09:26.649 --> 09:29.778
Yeah! Let's go save Woggles!

09:29.986 --> 09:31.738
- Waddles!
- Him too.

09:33.531 --> 09:36.705
All right! That p-terodactyl
won't know what hit him!

09:36.910 --> 09:38.787
( Chuckles )
It's "pterodactyl," man.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.417
Actually nobody knows
how to pronounce it

09:40.622 --> 09:43.171
because no one was alive
back in dinosaur days, so, uh...

09:43.583 --> 09:45.836
Whoa! Almost ran over
my own head there.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.842
( Chuckles )
Wow.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.718
Mabel, we've gotta talk.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.470
This is a really
high-stakes mission,

09:51.674 --> 09:53.927
and I'm a little worried about
Soos coming along on this one.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.689
I love the guy but
sometimes he messes stuff up.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.482
What? Since when?

10:01.267 --> 10:01.893
Sorry, dude.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.062
Sorry, dude.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.647
Look! A fairy!

10:05.855 --> 10:06.481
( Chuckles )

10:07.482 --> 10:09.735
Oh, sorry, dude,
I killed that fairy!

10:10.777 --> 10:11.994
Let him down easy.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.997
This is so great!
You and me, bro. Best friends!

10:15.198 --> 10:17.701
Fighting and potentially
high-fiving dinosaurs.

10:17.909 --> 10:21.038
Soos, look, I uh, I gotta
tell you something.

10:21.246 --> 10:24.466
Okay, but before you do, check out
these matching shirts I made for us!

10:24.874 --> 10:27.718
Who's this guy right here?
You. Totally you, dude.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.842
And these rays
indicate friendship.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.511
So what was it you were
going to tell me again?

10:33.716 --> 10:36.595
Uh... P-terodactyl, here we come!
( nervous chuckle )

10:36.803 --> 10:37.599
Yes!

10:38.138 --> 10:39.014
( Sighs )

10:39.222 --> 10:40.974
<i>Bros before dines'.!</i>

10:49.107 --> 10:51.405
Okay, the red yarn leads to...

10:53.111 --> 10:54.863
( scatting )

10:55.280 --> 10:56.702
Old Man McGucket?

10:57.115 --> 10:58.116
Howdy, friends!

10:58.408 --> 10:59.625
What are you doing out here?

10:59.826 --> 11:02.955
You'll never believe me! So I
was doin' my hourly hootenanny

11:03.163 --> 11:04.210
( scatting )

11:04.414 --> 11:05.506
Ugh! This guy.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.802
When this enormous wingly critter
stole my musical spoons

11:09.002 --> 11:12.222
and flew lickety split into the
abandoned mines, down yonder.

11:12.881 --> 11:13.723
Whoa!

11:13.965 --> 11:15.308
Looks kinda hairy down there.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.602
Come on, Grunkle Stan.
You can handle it!

11:17.802 --> 11:20.430
You punched a pterodactyl
in the face, remember?

11:20.638 --> 11:21.890
Oh yeah!
( nervous chuckle )

11:22.098 --> 11:24.647
I did do that, didn't I?
( nervous chuckle )

11:24.851 --> 11:27.445
My! What suspicious laughter!

11:27.645 --> 11:29.898
Guys, we're going in.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.155
Need someone to tag along
and tell weird personal stories?

11:33.359 --> 11:34.076
No, thanks.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.666
( Sighs ) So there I am, fighting a
raccoon for the same piece of meat,

11:39.824 --> 11:42.703
when our mouths get close
and we kiss accidentally!

11:42.911 --> 11:45.039
( Sighs )
You can't take a hint, can you?

11:45.246 --> 11:45.997
Nope!

11:47.707 --> 11:49.459
( Screaming )

11:51.294 --> 11:53.046
( groaning )

11:54.172 --> 11:55.344
Whoa...

11:58.009 --> 11:59.477
- Sweet Moses!
- Razzle dazzle!

11:59.677 --> 12:00.473
Fancy marmalade!

12:00.887 --> 12:02.935
These plants look all
jurassic-y.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.141
Huh, this little feller
smells like battery acid.

12:06.100 --> 12:06.896
(groans)

12:07.101 --> 12:09.274
Looks like I lost my
sense of smell! ( chuckles )

12:09.604 --> 12:12.403
Oh, Waddles!
We're gonna find you!

12:18.780 --> 12:20.532
( Screams )

12:22.742 --> 12:23.959
All: Wow!

12:24.160 --> 12:26.128
They're all trapped
inside tree sap!

12:26.454 --> 12:29.082
That's how they survived
for sixty-five million years.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.500
Whoa!

12:32.710 --> 12:34.712
The summer heat
must be melting them loose.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.343
<i>How mow'.!</i>

12:36.547 --> 12:39.551
Forget the Cornicorn, this is
the attraction of a lifetime!

12:39.759 --> 12:40.760
I could bring people down here

12:40.969 --> 12:42.562
and turn this into
some sort of theme park.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.102
"Jurassic Sap Hole!"

12:45.390 --> 12:46.437
Uh, dudes...

12:50.353 --> 12:51.980
Maybe we should keep moving.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.573
This could be a goldmine!

12:53.815 --> 12:56.113
Velvety rope type deal there,
ticket booth here...

12:56.317 --> 12:59.241
Ha! I should've put
that pig outside ages ago!

12:59.612 --> 13:01.865
Wait, what did you just say?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.075
- Hmm? What's that?
- You said the dinosaur

13:04.325 --> 13:05.872
flew into the house.

13:06.077 --> 13:06.828
'( QHSPS )
- No, wait!

13:07.036 --> 13:08.083
( Stutters )
If you think about it--

13:08.288 --> 13:11.258
You put Waddles outside,
then you lied to me about it!

13:11.457 --> 13:14.301
And now, thanks to you,
my pig could be dead!

13:14.502 --> 13:16.175
Waddles could be dead!

13:16.504 --> 13:18.598
Look, he's an animal!
He belongs outside.

13:18.798 --> 13:19.970
No! That's it!

13:20.216 --> 13:23.345
Grunkle Stan, I am never
ever speaking to you again!

13:23.720 --> 13:24.846
Look, you can't be serious!

13:25.054 --> 13:28.058
Oh, is someone talking right now?
Because I can't hear them.

13:28.266 --> 13:29.688
- Kid!
- La-la-la-la-la!

13:29.934 --> 13:32.403
I can't hear anyone.
No one's talking to me!

13:32.603 --> 13:33.729
Guys, guys, don't fight!

13:33.938 --> 13:35.440
Why can't you be more
like me and Dipper?

13:35.648 --> 13:37.195
Look, everything's
gonna be cool.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.245
All we gotta do to find
that pig is follow this here yarn!

13:40.445 --> 13:43.164
We just keep following, and following
and when we reach the end--

13:43.698 --> 13:44.494
Oh. Uh-Oh.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.169
Which, which cave was it again?

13:48.494 --> 13:50.496
Ugh, Soos! You lost the trail!

13:50.747 --> 13:52.841
Hey, come on, we'll
find our way. Trust me!

13:53.041 --> 13:53.758
( Screams )

13:55.710 --> 13:57.462
- Sorry, dude.
- Ugh, that is it!

13:57.837 --> 13:59.760
See, this is why I didn't
want to bring you along!

13:59.964 --> 14:01.216
( Stutters )
What do you mean?

14:01.424 --> 14:03.222
I mean, this is really
important to Mabel

14:03.426 --> 14:04.894
and you keep screwing
everything up!

14:05.094 --> 14:07.973
You ruined our photograph,
and now you've got us hopelessly lost!

14:08.181 --> 14:10.650
But we're P-terodactyl Bros.
I made T-shirts.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.568
It's pronounced "terro-dactyl!"

14:12.769 --> 14:14.612
And these shirts are useless.
They're gigantic!

14:14.812 --> 14:17.941
I. Have. A Different.
Body Type. Dude!

14:18.149 --> 14:20.527
- Oh, so it's my fault that... - I just
thought that maybe you'd grow into 'em...

14:20.735 --> 14:22.362
Who cares about shirts?
Stan is a murderer!

14:22.570 --> 14:24.618
Come on, I was doing
what was best for me--

14:24.822 --> 14:28.122
Hey, cheer up, fellers!
I fixed yer lantern.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.580
( Scream )

14:32.914 --> 14:34.166
( mock scream )

14:34.457 --> 14:36.755
( chuckles )
What-- What are we doin'?

14:40.963 --> 14:41.680
Hlflm?

14:44.258 --> 14:47.683
Nobody make any sudden
movements or loud noises.

14:48.513 --> 14:51.266
Yee-haw! We found a pterodactyl!

14:51.474 --> 14:52.600
( Screeching )

14:52.809 --> 14:53.731
( screaming )

14:54.519 --> 14:56.271

14:57.271 --> 15:00.115
( panicked panting )

15:01.025 --> 15:02.493
( roars )

15:03.111 --> 15:04.829
Guys, we need a plan
to get out of here.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.999
Okay, okay. How's about Mabel
knits Soos a pig costume...

15:08.199 --> 15:09.075
I like it!

15:09.283 --> 15:11.331
...and we use Soos as
a human sacrifice.

15:11.536 --> 15:12.253
I like it!

15:12.495 --> 15:13.462
Whaddya say, Mabel?

15:13.830 --> 15:14.456
Hmph!

15:14.664 --> 15:16.837
Oh, come on, you can't
stop talking to me forever!

15:17.041 --> 15:18.918
Yeah, Mabel, we have
to work together here.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.471
Oh what, you wanna work with Mabel,
but not your buddy Soos?

15:21.671 --> 15:25.346
( Overlapping bickering )

15:25.550 --> 15:26.722
(oinking )

15:26.926 --> 15:28.348
Wait, did you hear that?

15:29.762 --> 15:31.309

15:32.640 --> 15:33.687
-( Panting )
- Soos: Whoa. Wait, kid!

15:33.891 --> 15:34.733
Dipper: Wait, Mabel!

15:34.934 --> 15:35.901
Are you nuts?

15:36.394 --> 15:40.274
Oh, is someone speaking?
Because I can't hear anything!

15:40.982 --> 15:43.451
Oh, no! She's gone
deaf with fear!

15:43.651 --> 15:45.073
Mabel! Come back here!

15:48.990 --> 15:49.786

15:58.124 --> 16:00.297
Ssh! You're safe now.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.507

now we gotta get outta here!

Guys! We've got to save them!

16:40.583 --> 16:41.926
McGucket! Do you
have an invention

16:42.126 --> 16:43.548
that can distract
the pterodactyl?

16:43.794 --> 16:44.841
Do I!

16:46.964 --> 16:47.681
Nope.

I guess it's you or me, pig.

17:09.487 --> 17:10.204
(grunts)

17:14.659 --> 17:15.501
What are you lookin' at?

17:17.787 --> 17:19.380
Aw, come on!
Don't gimme that look.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.377
What am I supposed to do?
Let it eat me?

( Frustrated grunts )

17:24.042 --> 17:27.137
Oh, I get it! You're trying to
guilt me, well it ain't working, pal!

17:27.338 --> 17:29.386
Who cares if you're Mabel's
favorite thing in the world.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.809
I can live without the kid
talkin' to me all the time,

17:32.343 --> 17:35.517

18:10.965 --> 18:12.387
What do we do? What do we do?

We have to get in
a straight line.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.639
- What?
- A pterodactyl's eyes are so far apart,

18:17.847 --> 18:19.724
that if you stand right in
front of it, it can't see you.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.526
Soos, you've been wrong
about stuff all day! How can we--

18:22.727 --> 18:24.821
Dude, look. ( stutters )
I know I've messed up a lot,

18:25.104 --> 18:28.153
I can be sorta clumsy and it's
not always as lovable as I think.

But please, as my friend,
just trust me on this one.

Quick! The geyser can
shoot us back up!

20:16.799 --> 20:17.641
( Heavy breathing )

20:17.842 --> 20:18.889
( roaring )

20:19.802 --> 20:20.974
Come on. Go! Go!

20:21.178 --> 20:24.102
-( Roars )
-( screams )

20:24.473 --> 20:26.350
<i>Bros before dines'.!</i>

20:29.270 --> 20:30.146
( scream )

20:42.199 --> 20:42.950
( sighs )

20:43.284 --> 20:45.787
( panting ) Oh.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.761
I can't believe you did
all that for Waddles.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.635
Ah, well, I can't have my
favorite niece not talking to me.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.763
And if I gotta leap onto a pterodactyl
and punch him in the face,

20:59.967 --> 21:01.139
then that's what I gotta do.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.644
That's kinda sappy.

21:02.845 --> 21:04.097
( Stutters )
What! That's how I feel!

21:04.305 --> 21:06.023
- No, I mean...
- Oh, yeah.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.059
Gotcha! ( chuckles )
Uh-oh.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.644
( Struggling grunts )

21:09.852 --> 21:11.399
( scream )

21:11.645 --> 21:13.568
( snore )

21:14.440 --> 21:16.818
Check it out. That thing
destroyed my vest.

21:17.568 --> 21:18.615
Soos! Look!

21:18.819 --> 21:20.821
A real dinosaur tooth!
That's awesome!

21:21.697 --> 21:23.791
Not as awesome as you
saving us back there!

21:24.241 --> 21:25.208
Pterodactyl Bros?

21:26.202 --> 21:27.294
Pterodactyl bros.

21:27.495 --> 21:28.542
( Explosion sound )

21:29.079 --> 21:30.831
Hey, I pronounced it
right that time!

21:31.207 --> 21:33.710
Think we need to worry
about the rest of those dinosaurs?

21:33.918 --> 21:34.919
I doubt it.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.221
I ate my way through
a dinosaur!

21:45.387 --> 21:48.641
( laughs )

21:49.016 --> 21:50.063
Hi! I'm Bobby Renzobbi.

21:50.392 --> 21:51.860
Are your arms
jealous of your legs?

21:52.019 --> 21:53.145
Then you need arm pants!

21:53.354 --> 21:55.027
The pants that you
wear on your arms!

21:55.231 --> 21:57.984
Yeesh! Who actually buys
this infomercial stuff?

21:58.192 --> 21:59.409
( Embarrassed chuckle )
I know, right?

21:59.652 --> 22:01.404
Cancel the order!
Cancel the order!

22:02.321 --> 22:03.288
-( Snorting )
- Snorting!

22:03.489 --> 22:04.832
That's his tell! I fold.

22:05.115 --> 22:07.117
Tough luck, sucker.
Waddles was bluffing.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.796
What? I had four aces!
That pig is a wizard!

22:10.996 --> 22:13.419
-( Chewing, snorting )
- Look at him. He's taunting me!

22:13.624 --> 22:15.001
I've been cheating
the last eight turns.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.253
( laughs )
That's my girl!
