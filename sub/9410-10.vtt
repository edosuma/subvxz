They have games and everything.
That'd be fun.

04:53.367 --> 04:56.033
I got an idea how to get
back at Tabitha and Lee.

04:56.033 --> 04:59.567

to go trick-or-treating with you.

They're your friends.

12:56.233 --> 12:59.533
Hey, this is kind of fun.
We'll go with you. Come on.

12:59.533 --> 13:02.033
Show us this better place.

13:08.033 --> 13:10.300
- Shane?
- [ Screeches ]

13:12.300 --> 13:15.767
[ Pumpkin #1 ]
Now, through the woods.

13:15.767 --> 13:19.767
Move! Come on!

13:21.267 --> 13:24.133
- A better place.
- [ Pumpkin #2 ] Better place!

13:24.133 --> 13:28.067
- A better place!
- I wish they'd stop doing that.

13:28.067 --> 13:29.067
I think it's funny.

13:29.567 --> 13:31.567
Hey, Lee, which one do you think
is Shane, and which one is Shana?

13:31.567 --> 13:35.067
I don't know. It's kind of hard to
tell a girl pumpkin from a guy pumpkin.

13:35.067 --> 13:37.567
- [ Pumpkin #1 ] Don't talk!
- Keep moving!

13:37.567 --> 13:40.567
- Don't talk!
- Shana, is it you?

13:40.567 --> 13:43.833
Better place.
A better place! Move!

13:43.833 --> 13:46.333
Move!

13:48.833 --> 13:52.833
- Wow!
- This is a better place.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.833
Look at all these houses.
Just look at them!

14:00.333 --> 14:03.333
[ Tabitha ]
Come on, Drew!

14:03.333 --> 14:05.600
Hey, wait up!

14:11.100 --> 14:14.100
[ Pumpkin #2 ]
A better place. A better place.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.733
A better place. A better place.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.733
[ All ]
Trick or treat.

14:21.733 --> 14:23.733
[ All Gasping ]

14:26.233 --> 14:28.233
- Oh, wow!
- Thanks.

14:30.733 --> 14:32.900
[ Laughing, Chattering ]

14:38.967 --> 14:40.900
[ All ]
Trick or treat!

14:43.900 --> 14:47.900
I'm sorry.
I'm almost out.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.900
Wow! Thanks!

14:53.633 --> 14:55.633
Thanks a lot.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.633
That's the best I can do.

15:08.567 --> 15:11.567
Shane and Shana sure know
the coolest neighborhoods.

15:11.567 --> 15:13.567
Yeah. I wonder why
we've never heard of this place.

15:14.067 --> 15:16.567
- It's cool, all right. But--
- But what?

15:16.567 --> 15:19.567
Where is everybody?
We're the only kids here.

15:20.067 --> 15:22.067
- That's what's so great about it.
- Yeah.

15:22.067 --> 15:26.067
Check out all this candy. It's gonna
take us a year to eat all this stuff.

15:26.067 --> 15:28.067
Tabitha, what time is it?

15:28.067 --> 15:30.567
Uh, it's getting late.
We should get back. Come on, guys.

15:30.567 --> 15:34.733
- Lot more houses!
- What?

15:34.733 --> 15:37.033
Lots more houses.

15:37.033 --> 15:39.933
What are you talking about? We're
done trick-or-treating. We're leaving.

15:40.433 --> 15:42.567
What's your problem?
We have to leave.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.733
You cannot leave!

15:44.733 --> 15:48.033
- What do you mean, we can't leave?
- More houses.

15:48.033 --> 15:52.600
- You must trick-or-treat--
- Forever!

15:52.600 --> 15:55.800
- [ Sinister Laughing ]
- Listen, Shane and Shana.

15:55.800 --> 15:59.767
I know you two like this little game,
but you're not scaring us.

16:00.267 --> 16:03.667
Yeah, take off those stupid pumpkin
heads. They look fake anyway.

16:03.667 --> 16:06.600
Yeah,
your little Halloween joke is over.

16:08.233 --> 16:12.933
More houses!
Lots more houses!

16:12.933 --> 16:16.833
- Trick-or-treat forever!
- Obey!

16:20.567 --> 16:23.900
- Who-Who are you?
- What do you want?

16:23.900 --> 16:26.333
We want you
to trick-or-treat forever!

16:26.833 --> 16:31.367
- Forever! Now go!
- Trick-or-treat forever!

16:31.867 --> 16:36.000
Now go!

16:42.500 --> 16:45.200
Please let us stop.
We're tired.

16:45.200 --> 16:49.333
No time to rest.
More houses!

16:51.333 --> 16:53.933
We can't!
We're too tired.

16:53.933 --> 16:56.433
[ Tabitha ] Our bags are full.
We can't carry anymore.

16:56.433 --> 17:00.000
Please let us go.

17:02.200 --> 17:06.099
Now it's empty!
Go! More houses!

17:06.099 --> 17:09.067
Lots more houses!

17:09.067 --> 17:12.567
- Trick-or-treat forever!
- Forever!

17:12.567 --> 17:14.567
You--

17:14.567 --> 17:16.633
You're the ones.
You took them.

17:17.133 --> 17:18.933
You kidnapped
the four missing people.

17:18.933 --> 17:22.633
- Run!
- [ Sinister Laughing ]

17:22.633 --> 17:24.900
[ Shouts, Indistinct ]

17:24.900 --> 17:27.267
[ Sinister Laughing ]

17:27.267 --> 17:32.767
[ Pumpkin #2 ]
 More houses! More houses!

17:35.500 --> 17:38.533
- Run!
- [ Walker ] Run!

17:38.533 --> 17:43.233
- More! More! More! More!
- I'm running as fast as I can!

17:45.733 --> 17:47.733
- Hurry! Get up!
- I can't!

17:47.733 --> 17:49.733
More houses!

17:50.733 --> 17:55.233
- Where are they?
- Where'd they go?

17:55.233 --> 17:57.733
- Where are they?
- [ Coughs ]

17:57.733 --> 17:59.733
They're gone.

17:59.733 --> 18:01.700
[ Sinister Laughing ]

18:01.700 --> 18:04.200
Too bad you tried to run.

18:04.700 --> 18:07.700
And you seemed like such
an obedient little girl.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.167
[ Gasping ]

18:13.500 --> 18:15.867
Make them one of us!

18:16.300 --> 18:19.200
- Please! No!
- Put on the head!

18:19.200 --> 18:20.767
[ Both Scream ]

18:21.267 --> 18:25.200
- [ Sinister Laughing ]
- [ Tabitha ] Run, Lee!

18:25.200 --> 18:28.700
[ Pumpkin #2 ]
Run! Run! We will find you!

18:28.700 --> 18:31.233
[ Sinister Laughter ]

18:31.233 --> 18:34.167
I'd say we scared them
pretty good.

18:34.167 --> 18:36.600
[ Laughing Hysterically ]

18:42.367 --> 18:44.367
It was you!

18:46.367 --> 18:50.233
I mean, at first, I thought
it was you, but then I didn't.

18:50.233 --> 18:53.967
And-- Oh, man!
Those disguises were great!

18:53.967 --> 18:58.267
But how? I mean,
the way you just changed...

18:58.267 --> 19:02.933
and the way that-- th-th--
beam shot out of your-- your claw.

19:02.933 --> 19:06.467
Okay, you guys.
How'd you do that?

19:06.467 --> 19:09.800
Well, there are advantages
to being an alien.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.533
- An alien?
- [ Drew ] Yeah. Before they moved away,

19:12.533 --> 19:14.933
Shane and Shana used
to be my best friends.

19:14.933 --> 19:17.267
They lived next door to me.

19:17.267 --> 19:19.933
[ Exhales ]
How come you never told me?

19:19.933 --> 19:21.733
Would you have believed me?

19:21.733 --> 19:25.433
I-- [ Exhales ]
I don't know.

19:25.433 --> 19:27.933
Thanks, you guys.

19:27.933 --> 19:30.433
Thanks for helping me get
back at Tabitha and Lee.

19:31.467 --> 19:33.967
I hope I didn't scare them too much.

19:33.967 --> 19:37.500
Of course, I hope I didn't
scare them too little either.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.500
That was a blast!

19:40.500 --> 19:43.500
You know, I think we're getting
to like Halloween as much as you do.

19:43.500 --> 19:47.467
Hey, it's the one time of year
you get to be someone else.

19:49.933 --> 19:51.833
[ Gasps ]

19:53.033 --> 19:55.967
We'd better get back.

19:55.967 --> 19:59.467
- Nice meeting you, Walker.
- You too.

19:59.467 --> 20:01.967
- We'll see you next year, Drew.
- Thanks again.

20:06.033 --> 20:07.767
Shane, Shana, wait!

20:07.767 --> 20:10.700
Do you guys want some candy
for the trip back?

20:11.333 --> 20:13.800
No, thanks.
It's not part of our diet.

20:13.800 --> 20:17.400
But if you know where some nice
plump adults are, we'll eat those.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.400
You mean--
[ Clears Throat ]

20:20.900 --> 20:23.200
- you eat humans?
- [ Shana ] Only when we're hungry.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.133
We just finished a four-course
meal earlier tonight.

20:28.133 --> 20:30.133
Four-course meal?

20:32.133 --> 20:35.367
- The four missing people!
- Oh, by the way, we're pretty full.

20:35.367 --> 20:39.067
But I wouldn't eat all that candy.
It might fatten you up.

20:39.067 --> 20:42.333
And we will be back
next year to feed again.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.133
Happy Halloween.
