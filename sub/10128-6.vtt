HELLO.
I'M TOPANGA LAWRENCE.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.600
HI. I'M CORY MATTHEWS.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.700
WE'LL BE HOSTING
YOUR HOSTS

00:36.700 --> 00:39.000
ON THIS HISTORIC TOUR
OF PENNBROOK COLLEGE.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.100
FOR OVER A CENTURY,
PENNBROOK HAS BEEN A PLACE

00:41.100 --> 00:44.400
WHERE THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS
COME EACH FALL
TO EMBARK ON A JOURNEY.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.233
A JOURNEY THAT WILL
TAKE THEM TO A "UGIVERSE"

00:46.233 --> 00:48.100
OF EXCITING
"EXPERIMENCES".

00:48.100 --> 00:51.033
SO IF PENNBROOK IS
THE COLLEGE OF YOUR CHOICE...

00:51.033 --> 00:53.767
THEN COME ON.

00:53.767 --> 00:55.900
CUT! CUT!

00:55.900 --> 00:56.967
YA THINK?!

00:56.967 --> 00:57.967
WHERE YA BEEN?
I STINK.

00:57.967 --> 01:01.500
I--I--I THINK I SAID
THE WORD "UGIVERSE".

01:01.500 --> 01:03.400
SHALL WE TRY IT
ONE MORE TIME?

01:03.400 --> 01:05.900
MAYBE TAKE 59
WILL BE THE CHARM.

01:05.900 --> 01:10.500
NO, NO. I KNEW WAY BACK
AT TAKE 33 I WAS SUCKO.

01:10.500 --> 01:11.500
I QUIT.

01:11.500 --> 01:12.834
[APPLAUSE]

01:12.834 --> 01:15.367
WAIT A MINUTE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:15.367 --> 01:16.700
CORY AND I
WERE PICKED

01:16.700 --> 01:17.700
AS THE PERFECT
FRESHMAN COUPLE

01:17.700 --> 01:19.834
BECAUSE OF OUR
NATURAL CHEMISTRY.

01:19.834 --> 01:22.300
YEAH,
WHERE'D THAT GO?

01:22.300 --> 01:24.734
CORY, COME ON,
DON'T LEAVE YET.

01:24.734 --> 01:27.734
I WANT TO HEAR YOU
BUTCHER THE WORD
CURRICULUM.

01:27.734 --> 01:30.200
OH, YEAH? IF CURRICUM
IS SUCH AN EASY WORLD,

01:30.200 --> 01:31.500
THEN LET'S HEAR YOU SAY IT.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.033
CURRICULUM.

01:35.033 --> 01:36.400
WOW.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.000
DO THAT AGAIN.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.800
CURRICULUM.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.867
WOW. I LIKE IT.

01:41.867 --> 01:44.700
HEY, YOU WOULDN'T
POSSIBLY CONSIDER, UH...

01:44.700 --> 01:45.734
WHAT A GREAT IDEA.

01:45.734 --> 01:47.867
SHAWN, YOU COULD
TAKE MY PLACE.
PERFECT.

01:47.867 --> 01:49.367
OH, I...I DON'T KNOW.

01:49.367 --> 01:52.200
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
DOING THIS UNLESS CORY
IS GONNA DO IT.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.934
CORY, I CAN'T BE YOU.

01:53.934 --> 01:56.133
SHAWN, LISTEN, I DON'T
WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE

01:56.133 --> 01:57.133
FOR RUINING THIS FILM.

01:57.133 --> 01:58.200
LISTEN, YOU CAN
TAKE MY PLACE.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.300
BESIDES, TOPANGA
WILL BE HERE.

01:59.300 --> 02:00.700
SHE'LL MAKE YOU FEEL
COMFORTABLE.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.700
I THINK IT'S A BAD IDEA.

02:02.700 --> 02:06.900
OH, WHEN DID I EVER HAVE
A BAD IDEA?

02:07.967 --> 02:10.100
THE SOCIAL LIFE
AT PENNBROOK UNIVERSITY

02:10.100 --> 02:11.867
WILL LEAD TO LIFELONG
FRIENDSHIPS,

02:11.867 --> 02:13.667
AND WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE MORE.

02:13.667 --> 02:14.667
RIGHT, HONEY?

02:14.667 --> 02:16.400
WELL, THAT'S RIGHT,
SNOOKUMS.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.200
WHY, I REMEMBER
THE FIRST NIGHT WE MET,

02:18.200 --> 02:20.600
RIGHT HERE IN THE NEWLY
REMODELED STUDENT UNION,

02:20.600 --> 02:22.400
PAID FOR BY
A GENEROUS DONATION

02:22.400 --> 02:25.200
OF MRS. STANLEY KANDELMAN,
CLASS OF '48.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.300
DON'T THEY LOOK
GREAT TOGETHER?

02:27.300 --> 02:29.300
YOU KNOW, THEY REALLY DO.

02:29.300 --> 02:30.467
I JUST MEANT THEY DO.

02:30.467 --> 02:32.667
I DON'T MEAN
THEY REALLY DO.

02:32.667 --> 02:36.800
IN FACT, MANY STUDENTS WIND UP
MEETING THEIR LIFELONG MATES
HERE AT PENNBROOK.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.734
AND WHILE
THAT MAY NOT BE
THE NUMBER-ONE REASON

02:38.734 --> 02:40.100
TO ATTEND
PENNBROOK COLLEGE...

02:40.100 --> 02:42.200
IT SURE RANKS HIGH
ON OUR LIST.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.400
HEH HEH.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.300
WELL, THAT WENT WELL.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.867
OK, LET'S HAVE A NICE KISS.

02:47.867 --> 02:49.734
WHAT?
KISS HER.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.600
NO, DON'T!

02:51.600 --> 02:55.600
COME ON, MORE HEAT.
COME ON, YOU'RE IN LOVE.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.200
LESS HEAT! LESSER!

03:01.200 --> 03:04.467
THAT'S HOT.
THAT'S VERY HOT.

03:04.467 --> 03:05.567
CUT! CUT!

03:05.567 --> 03:06.767
CUT!

03:07.834 --> 03:10.400
BACK AWAY
FROM THE GIRLFRIEND!

03:16.734 --> 03:18.400
WHAT WAS THAT?!
WHAT?

03:18.400 --> 03:20.000
WHAT WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT!

03:20.000 --> 03:21.400
YOU KISSED MY GIRLFRIEND!

03:21.400 --> 03:22.467
HE TOLD ME TO.

03:22.467 --> 03:23.600
IF HE TOLD YOU
TO PUT A KNIFE

03:23.600 --> 03:24.867
THROUGH MY HEART,
WOULD YOU DO IT?

03:24.867 --> 03:26.700
IT DEPENDS. WOULD YOU
BE YELLING IN MY EAR

03:26.700 --> 03:29.300
THROUGH A BULLHORN
AT THE TIME?

03:31.367 --> 03:33.600
I DON'T LIKE THAT YOU
KISSED MY GIRLFRIEND.

03:33.600 --> 03:34.734
IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

03:34.734 --> 03:35.800
CORY, THIS IS SILLY.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.200
PLEASE DON'T GO CRAZY
OVER THIS. PLEASE.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.834
PLEASE DON'T GO
CRAZY OVER THIS.

03:40.834 --> 03:42.300
PLEASE.

03:49.767 --> 03:50.967
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

03:50.967 --> 03:52.934
KISS HIM AGAIN,
YOU LITTLE--

03:52.934 --> 03:55.100
OH, YOU HURT ME SO BAD.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.100
AND YOU!

03:56.100 --> 03:59.100
YOU BEST FRIEND-
GIGOLO-HOME WRECKER.

03:59.100 --> 04:00.600
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE HER BACK

04:00.600 --> 04:03.000
TO YOUR TORNADO-INFESTED
TRAILER PARK?!

04:03.000 --> 04:04.367
AAH!

04:04.367 --> 04:06.667
TOPANGA!

04:06.667 --> 04:08.000
Neighbor: SHUT UP!

04:08.000 --> 04:09.133
YOU SHUT UP!

04:09.133 --> 04:10.133
NO, YOU SHUT UP!

04:10.133 --> 04:11.600
NO, YOU SHUT UP!
NO, YOU!

04:11.600 --> 04:12.600
YOU SHUT UP FIRST!

04:12.600 --> 04:13.600
NO, YOU!

04:13.600 --> 04:14.667
NO, YOU! COME ON!

04:14.667 --> 04:15.934
YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME?!

04:15.934 --> 04:19.400
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!
COME ON!

04:22.233 --> 04:24.934
[TIMIDLY]
HELLO.

04:27.567 --> 04:28.600
MMM.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.467
MMM, THAT'S GOOD.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.934
OOH, RACHEL, ANOTHER
SPLASH OF TOMATO?

04:38.934 --> 04:40.600
OH, NO, NO, NO.
NO, THANKS, ERIC.

04:40.600 --> 04:41.967
I REALLY HAVE TO
GET TO CLASS.

04:41.967 --> 04:43.300
OH, HERE.
LET ME GET THIS
FOR YOU.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.500
OH, JACK,
YOU KNOW YOU REALLY
DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.000
OH, YOU KIDDING?
I'M HAPPY TO DO IT.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.600
MY FIRST CLASS DOESN'T START
FOR ANOTHER HOUR.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.667
MY FIRST CLASS
IS PROBABLY OVER BY NOW.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.600
WELL, CAN'T WE JUST WAIT

04:53.600 --> 04:57.400
TILL WE GET HOME
TO DO THE DISHES?

04:57.400 --> 04:58.600
YOU KNOW, LOOK, YOU GUYS,

04:58.600 --> 05:00.467
IF YOU'RE DOING THIS
FOR MY BENEFIT,

05:00.467 --> 05:01.500
IT REALLY IS NOT NECESSARY.

05:01.500 --> 05:02.500
FOR YOUR BENEFIT?

05:02.500 --> 05:03.800
DOING THIS FOR YOU?

05:03.800 --> 05:05.867
NO. SEE, WE DO THIS
FOR OURSELVES.

05:05.867 --> 05:07.934
IT'S CALLED PERSONAL PRIDE.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.567
OK, WELL, I'M GOING
TO GO TO CLASS NOW.

05:12.567 --> 05:14.233
OH, OH, YEAH.
HERE YOU GO.

05:14.233 --> 05:15.467
PUT THE BAG
ON THERE.

05:15.467 --> 05:16.467
THANKS.

05:16.467 --> 05:19.000
HEY,
HAVE A GREAT DAY.

05:20.033 --> 05:21.133
THANK YOU.

05:21.133 --> 05:23.600
MAKE A NEW FRIEND.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.600
OK.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.233
ALL RIGHT.

05:26.233 --> 05:27.567
OH, THANKS.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.500
YOU GO FOR IT.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.467
BYE.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.600
[BURPS]

05:35.600 --> 05:36.800
OH.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.834
BOY, I'VE BEEN
HOLDING THAT IN
FOR 3 WEEKS!

05:39.834 --> 05:40.834
SHE'S KILLING US, MAN,

05:40.834 --> 05:42.667
WITH THIS CLEANING
AND CONSIDERATION.

05:42.667 --> 05:43.767
I'M TELLING
YOU SOMETHING,

05:43.767 --> 05:44.800
MANNERS BLOW.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.900
IF YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR
MY BENEFIT,

05:46.900 --> 05:48.767
IT REALLY ISN'T NECESSARY,
MY BUTT.

05:48.767 --> 05:49.767
WHO DOES
SHE THINK SHE IS?

05:49.767 --> 05:51.400
WE KNOW WHAT
WOMEN EXPECT.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.900
YEAH, DOES SHE THINK
SHE'S THE FIRST WOMAN
WE'VE EVER LIVED WITH?

05:53.900 --> 05:56.867
DUDE, I LIVED WITH
MY MOTHER FOR 18 YEARS.

05:56.867 --> 05:59.567
WOMEN THRIVE ON GUYS
BEING ALL PROPER AND CRAP.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.967
YEAH, I'M TELLING
YOU SOMETHING,

06:00.967 --> 06:04.000
SHE DON'T WANT
TO SEE THE REAL US.

06:08.233 --> 06:10.500
MY MOTHER NEVER DID.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.467
YEP. WELL,
MOTHERS CAN'T LEAVE.

06:12.467 --> 06:15.000
HOTTIE HOT ROOMMATES
HAVE NO SUCH ALLEGIANCE.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.033
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:16.033 --> 06:17.467
AND IF WE WANT
TO KEEP RACHEL HERE,

06:17.467 --> 06:18.600
WE CAN NEVER, NEVER
SHOW OUR REAL SELVES.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.600
I LOVE YOUR MOTHER.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.233
W-WAIT A MINUTE.

06:25.233 --> 06:26.367
RACHEL'S NOT HERE
ANYMORE.

06:26.367 --> 06:29.100
HA! WHAT ARE WE STILL DOING
WITH OUR PANTS ON?

06:29.100 --> 06:30.200
AFTER YOU.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.000
WHY, THANK YOU.

06:35.233 --> 06:36.467
OHH.            AHH.

06:36.467 --> 06:38.900
[CRYING]

06:42.500 --> 06:43.967
TRAMP, MAN!

06:43.967 --> 06:45.467
I HEAR YOU, BROTHER.

06:45.467 --> 06:47.300
I NEVER SAW IT COMING,
ISAAC.

06:47.300 --> 06:49.834
YOU CAN'T BLAME
YOURSELF, LITTLE BUDDY.

06:49.834 --> 06:52.800
THE SAME THING HAPPENED
TO ME ONCE.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.967
TOPANGA!

06:54.967 --> 06:57.233
FRED!

06:57.233 --> 06:58.767
[CRYING]

07:15.700 --> 07:17.567
SHAWN? WAKE UP.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.667
NO, CLOWN, NO!

07:20.734 --> 07:22.133
YOU SLEPT ON THE COUCH?

07:22.133 --> 07:23.900
OH, YEAH, I HAD TO.

07:23.900 --> 07:25.500
HE, UM, INSTALLED
A DEADBOLT.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.700
YEAH, I KNOW.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.400
HE'S BEEN AVOIDING ME
SINCE THE INCIDENT, TOO.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.233
WHAT DO YOU THINK HIS
NEXT MOVE'S GOING TO BE?

07:30.233 --> 07:31.734
WELL, YOU KNOW HIM
AS WELL AS I DO.

07:31.734 --> 07:34.300
YEAH, HE'S PROBABLY
LET IT EAT AT HIM ALL NIGHT.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.900
YEAH, AND BY NOW
HE'S WAY OUT OF CONTROL.

07:39.367 --> 07:41.900
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY
NO SURPRISE TO YOU

07:41.900 --> 07:43.900
THAT I'VE HAD
A LONG, HARD NIGHT

07:43.900 --> 07:45.700
AND A LOT OF TIME TO THINK.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.600
AND I KNOW THAT
THE TWO OF YOU ARE THINKING

07:47.600 --> 07:50.100
THAT THE CRAZY LITTLE MAN
WOULD DWELL AND STEW

07:50.100 --> 07:53.100
AND BLOW ALL THIS HORRIBLY
OUT OF PROPORTION. HA.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.934
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'VE WORKED THROUGH IT,

07:55.934 --> 08:01.300
I'M FINE, AND I AM
A HAPPY, HEALTHY CORY.

08:01.300 --> 08:04.300
AND I JUST WANT TO ASK
ONE THING.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.400
WHAT'S THIS?

08:06.400 --> 08:08.233
NO, CORY,
WE WERE JUST--

08:11.500 --> 08:13.600
UNDERPANTS!

08:13.600 --> 08:15.767
I ALWAYS
SLEEP LIKE THIS.

08:15.767 --> 08:17.133
UNDERPANTS!

08:17.133 --> 08:18.367
OH, HERE WE GO.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.800
OK, HERE'S HOW
WE'RE GOING TO HANDLE THIS.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.300
NOW, IT'S VERY CLEAR
THAT THE TWO OF YOU

08:22.300 --> 08:26.300
HAVE HAD A LOT OF
HIDDEN SEXUAL TENSION
FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.000
NO, WE HAVEN'T.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.467
I AM SPEAKING NOW.

08:29.467 --> 08:30.967
NOW, THERE IS
ONE SOLUTION TO THIS

08:30.967 --> 08:32.500
AND ONE SOLUTION ONLY.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.900
[GROWLS]

08:35.100 --> 08:37.033
I WANT YOU TWO
TO GO OUT ON A DATE.

08:37.033 --> 08:38.567
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:38.567 --> 08:39.667
YOU'RE GOING OUT
ON A DATE,

08:39.667 --> 08:41.100
AND YOU'RE GOING TO
EXPLORE YOUR FEELINGS.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.200
THERE ARE NO FEELINGS.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.400
THERE ARE FEELINGS.
MAYBE YOU DON'T THINK

08:43.400 --> 08:44.900
THERE ARE FEELINGS,
BUT THE TAPE SAYS
THERE ARE.

08:44.900 --> 08:48.400
I SHOULD KNOW.
I WATCHED IT 512 TIMES.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.200
NOW, WHEN YOU KISSED
EACH OTHER,

08:50.200 --> 08:52.934
YOU--YOU FELT SOMETHING.
YOU BOTH DID.

08:52.934 --> 08:54.467
WE'RE NOT GOING OUT
ON A DATE.

08:54.467 --> 08:55.467
YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT
ON A DATE,

08:55.467 --> 08:56.467
OTHERWISE
IT'S GOING TO HAUNT US

08:56.467 --> 08:57.600
FOR THE REST
OF OUR LIVES.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.934
WHY DOES EVERYTHING
HAVE TO HAUNT US

08:58.934 --> 09:00.300
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES?

09:00.300 --> 09:02.500

09:03.567 --> 09:05.767
WILL YOU GO OUT

09:19.467 --> 09:20.867

09:20.867 --> 09:23.667
YOU KNOW, YOU PEOPLE
CONTRIBUTED QUITE A BIT
TO THIS COUNTRY.

09:23.667 --> 09:24.734
THANKS.

09:24.734 --> 09:27.200
BUT I GOT
MY OWN PROBLEMS.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.000
NOW, I'VE KEPT YOU
IN THE DARK ABOUT THIS

09:29.000 --> 09:30.900
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH
YOU AND SHAWN BROKE UP,

09:30.900 --> 09:32.600
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU
STILL CARE ABOUT HIM.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.967
AND YOU, OF COURSE, KNOW
HOW MUCH I CARE ABOUT

09:34.967 --> 09:36.100
THAT BETRAYING
WITCH OF A GIRL--

09:36.100 --> 09:37.100
GET TO THE POINT.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.767
SHAWN AND TOPANGA
ARE OUT ON A DATE.

09:39.767 --> 09:41.133
[SNORTS]
HA HA!

09:41.133 --> 09:42.800
THEY WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

09:42.800 --> 09:43.800
IT'S TRUE.

09:43.800 --> 09:44.834
WELL, WHY WOULD THEY--

09:44.834 --> 09:46.100
BECAUSE I MADE
THE RESERVATION.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.600
WELL, WHAT--
AND I PAID
FOR IT.

09:47.600 --> 09:48.600
WHY DID YOU--

09:48.600 --> 09:49.900
I ORDERED THE SOUFFLé
IN ADVANCE.
WHY?

09:49.900 --> 09:52.367
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO DO
THAT SORT OF THING,
ANGELA.

09:52.367 --> 09:53.367
CORY, WHY?

09:53.367 --> 09:55.000
I DON'T KNOW.
CALL THE RESTAURANT.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.900
GOSH, THE LOVE
OF MY LIFE IS OUT
WITH MY BEST FRIEND,

09:57.900 --> 10:00.367
AND YOU WANT TO DISCUSS
DESSERT POLICY.

10:00.367 --> 10:03.200
JEEZ, YOU'RE ANNOYING.

10:03.200 --> 10:07.233
CORY, IS THIS STILL
ABOUT THIS KISS?

10:07.233 --> 10:08.967
WAIT A MINUTE.
SHE TOLD YOU ABOUT IT?

10:08.967 --> 10:11.400
THAT MEANS IT MUST HAVE
MEANT SOMETHING TO HER.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.400
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.467
IN ALL THE TIME THAT
YOU WERE WITH SHAWN,

10:14.467 --> 10:16.567
DID HE EVER CALL OUT
THE NAME TOPANGA?

10:16.567 --> 10:19.000
NO, BUT HE CALLED OUT
THE NAME CORY.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.700
IN--IN WHAT CONTEXT?

10:21.700 --> 10:24.467
IN THE CONTEXT
OF HOW STUPID YOU ARE.

10:24.467 --> 10:26.200
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU WEREN'T THERE,
ANGELA.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.734
YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM
KISS EACH OTHER.

10:28.734 --> 10:29.934
IT WAS A MOVIE!

10:29.934 --> 10:30.934
THERE WAS PASSION.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.667
THEY WERE ACTING.
THEY WERE PRETENDING.

10:32.667 --> 10:35.133
THEY WEREN'T PRETENDING.
I KNOW WHEN TOPANGA
PRETENDS.

10:35.133 --> 10:36.200
I'VE BEEN THERE.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.767
OH, CORY, YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.367
THEY'RE GOING TO GO OUT
ON THIS DATE,

10:39.367 --> 10:41.233
SPEND THE EVENING
TALKING ABOUT YOU

10:41.233 --> 10:42.867
AND HAVE A TERRIBLE TIME.

10:42.867 --> 10:45.200
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

10:45.200 --> 10:47.300
I KNOW SO.

10:47.300 --> 10:50.100
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS A LOT, ANGELA.

10:50.100 --> 10:51.800

11:02.000 --> 11:04.233
OH, HE'S NOT HERE.
LET'S GO IN.

11:04.233 --> 11:06.400
OK, BUT WE SHOULD PUT
A RUBBER BAND ON THE DOOR,

11:06.400 --> 11:09.400
JUST IN CASE HE COMES BACK.

11:10.467 --> 11:12.100
AFTER YOU.

11:16.700 --> 11:19.400
Shawn: THIS IS
THE GREATEST NIGHT
I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.800
I MEAN,
TO REALIZE HOW WE FEEL
ABOUT EACH OTHER

11:21.800 --> 11:22.967
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

11:22.967 --> 11:24.300
Topanga: WE SHOULD
THANK CORY.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.700
Shawn:
TOPANGA, I'M NOT SURE
WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.233
AFTER ALL,
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

HE'S MY FIANCé AND
I'M FINE WITH IT.

11:32.967 --> 11:34.300
YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.867
WE CAN'T FIGHT WHAT WE'VE
BEEN FIGHTING FOR 15 YEARS.

11:36.867 --> 11:38.800
I'M JUST NOT
STRONG ENOUGH ANYMORE.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.400
I CAN'T JUST SIT HERE
AND WATCH YOUR BEAUTIFUL SKIN

11:41.400 --> 11:44.000

AND PERFECT FACE

11:44.000 --> 11:48.734

YOU WANT TO SAY
ABOUT MY EYES?

11:51.600 --> 11:52.734
YES!

11:52.734 --> 11:56.834
YES. THE--THE NUMBER

11:56.834 --> 11:59.000
THAT'S, UM--THAT'S NICE.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.066

12:00.066 --> 12:01.967
YES, BUT ENOUGH
ABOUT YOUR EYES.

12:01.967 --> 12:04.600
HOW DO YOU LIKE WHAT I'M
DOING TO YOU RIGHT NOW?

OH. AND WHERE DID YOU
GET THIS GRAVY? HEAVEN?

12:56.100 --> 12:58.300
YOU KNOW, FUNNY LITTLE STORY.

12:58.300 --> 12:59.767
I WAS WATCHING
MARTHA STEWART TODAY,

12:59.767 --> 13:02.800
AND I GOT A LOVELY TIP ON
HOW TO FRESHEN OUR POTPOURRI

13:02.800 --> 13:04.800
WITH CRANBERRIES
AND LILAC PETALS.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.100
OH, YES,

OH. HOW WAS
YOUR DAY, RACHEL?

13:08.100 --> 13:09.400

13:09.400 --> 13:10.600

ON THE TABLE,

13:10.600 --> 13:12.600
AND WE ATE
WITH OUR FINGERS.

13:12.600 --> 13:13.900

I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

13:17.667 --> 13:20.200
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, DOING?

13:20.200 --> 13:24.200
YOU ACTUALLY THINK
THAT I THINK THAT
YOU LIVE LIKE THIS?

13:24.200 --> 13:27.867
YOU'RE JUST
TREATING ME DIFFERENTLY
BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN.

HA. SHOWS HOW MUCH
YOU KNOW.

13:29.700 --> 13:32.700

YOU'RE THE FIRST WOMAN
WE'VE EVER LIVED WITH?

13:32.700 --> 13:34.200
BESIDES YOUR MOTHERS, YES.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.834
IS THAT
AN ACCURATE COUNT,

13:35.834 --> 13:37.700
I STAYED WITH
NANA BOO BOO ONCE.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.934

13:39.934 --> 13:41.500
I HATE THIS.
IT'S LIKE I HAVE TO BE
ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.300
IT'S LIKE I'M LIVING
WITH MY MOTHER.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.200
ACTUALLY,
DO YOU HAVE A PICTURE
OF YOUR MOTHER?

13:45.200 --> 13:46.600
NO REASON.

13:47.834 --> 13:49.600
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN'T DO THIS. I CAN'T.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.967

SO I CAN BE MYSELF.

STICK WITH THE PLAN.

HANDLE IT.

YOU'RE GOING TO
OFFEND ME OR SOMETHING.

I CAN BE JUST AS BIG
A SLOB AS THE TWO OF YOU.

MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAYS,

15:10.500 --> 15:12.700
NEVER PUT YOUR FEET
ON THE TABLE...

15:12.700 --> 15:16.500
UNLESS THEY'RE IN
MARINARA SAUCE.

THE WAY THIS IS GOING.

'CAUSE I'M A WOMAN.

I'M YOUR ROOMMATE.

YEAH!

16:32.667 --> 16:34.200
NOW HIT JACK WITH THE PIE.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.567
NO!

16:46.834 --> 16:47.900
AND WHEN I GET OUT
OF THE SHOWER,

16:47.900 --> 16:50.734
I EXPECT THIS PLACE CLEAN.

I THINK THERE WAS
A COW IN THERE.

17:26.600 --> 17:28.033
CORY, YOU'RE LETTING
YOUR IMAGINATION

17:28.033 --> 17:29.900
RUN AWAY WITH YOU.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.600
REALLY? GO AHEAD.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.767
TELL ME THERE'S NOTHING
GOING ON IN THERE.

17:33.767 --> 17:35.367

GOING ON IN THERE.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.767
NO, I DON'T WANT TO SEE.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.767
THERE'S NO ONE HERE.

17:48.767 --> 17:49.800
OF COURSE NOT.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
SHAWN AND TOPANGA.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT EACH OTHER

17:53.000 --> 17:54.200
BECAUSE THEY CARE
ABOUT YOU.

17:54.200 --> 17:57.033
NO, ANGELA, YOU ARE THINKING
ABOUT THIS TOO LOGICALLY.

17:57.033 --> 17:59.033
AND THIS DEFIES LOGIC.

17:59.033 --> 18:02.567
THIS IS RAW, HOT,
UNFILTERED PASSION.

18:02.567 --> 18:04.900
AND THAT KISS OPENED
THE GATES.

18:04.900 --> 18:05.867
THERE ARE NO GATES.

OH, THERE'S GATES.

18:08.600 --> 18:12.033

EACH OTHER A LONG TIME?

18:12.033 --> 18:13.000
YEAH.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.867
WELL, IS THERE
ANY TENSION BETWEEN US?

18:16.967 --> 18:18.834
WELL...
THERE WAS THAT ONE TIME

18:18.834 --> 18:21.867
THAT YOU DIDN'T GET ME
A GIFT FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

18:21.867 --> 18:25.600
I MEAN, I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING, BUT, OOH.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.734
NOT THAT KIND OF TENSION.

18:28.734 --> 18:29.800
OH, YOU MEAN--

18:29.800 --> 18:32.200
I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVER
THOUGHT OF ME IN A WAY

18:32.200 --> 18:33.400
OTHER THAN JUST A FRIEND?

18:33.400 --> 18:34.400
NEVER!

18:34.400 --> 18:37.100
TELL THE TRUTH.
ONE TIME.

18:37.100 --> 18:38.133
REALLY?

18:38.133 --> 18:39.700
YEAH,
BUT IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

18:39.700 --> 18:41.934
SEE, I HAD A DREAM,
AND YOU WERE IN IT.

18:41.934 --> 18:43.033
WAS IT A GOOD DREAM?

18:43.033 --> 18:44.133
YES.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.867
WAS IT REAL?
NO.

18:47.867 --> 18:48.867
NEITHER WAS THE KISS.

18:48.867 --> 18:50.500
YEAH, BUT--BUT THEY--
IT HAPPENED.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.967
AND THEY FELT SOMETHING.

18:51.967 --> 18:53.000
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.667
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT

18:54.667 --> 18:55.867
WITHOUT FEELING
ANYTHING.

18:55.867 --> 18:58.000
EVEN IF THEY'RE
JUST FRIENDS?

18:58.000 --> 18:59.500
YEAH.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.000
OK.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.934
OH, NO. IT'S THE DREAM.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.200
WOW!

19:12.200 --> 19:13.500
WHAT?

19:13.500 --> 19:14.500
NOTHING.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.734
NO, TELL ME.

AND THAT'S WHY
IT DOESN'T MATTER
THAT SHE KISSED SHAWN,

19:33.767 --> 19:36.033
BECAUSE SHE ONLY FEELS
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

19:36.033 --> 19:39.233
SO EVEN A KISS LIKE
YOU AND I JUST HAD

19:39.233 --> 19:41.500
IS JUST A KISS
BETWEEN FRIENDS...

19:41.500 --> 19:43.767
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LOVE ME.

20:04.967 --> 20:07.000
AND SHAWN
WAS IN HIS UNDERPANTS?

20:07.000 --> 20:10.767
CORY, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
WITH TOPANGA,

20:10.767 --> 20:12.834
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD TRUST HER MORE?

20:12.834 --> 20:15.100
OH, NOBODY WOULD TRUST
ANYBODY THEY CAUGHT

20:15.100 --> 20:16.900
IN SUCH
A COMPROMISING POSITION.

20:16.900 --> 20:19.300
THERE YOU ARE.
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

20:19.300 --> 20:20.500
I CAN EXPLAIN.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.400

HE'S IN BED WITH ANGELA.

WANTS US TO BEHAVE
LIKE OURSELVES,
DOES SHE?

20:39.834 --> 20:40.834
WE'RE GONNA SMOKE HER

20:40.834 --> 20:42.367
