[woman narrating] <i> The people</i>
<i>of the world are more</i>
<i>or less the same.</i>

03:14.195 --> 03:18.597
<i>Though we may come</i>
<i>in different shapes and colors,</i>

03:18.599 --> 03:21.967
<i> we all share</i>
<i> the same inheritance,</i>

03:21.969 --> 03:23.969
<i> and we all have</i>
<i> our back stories,</i>

03:24.705 --> 03:26.205
<i> and our secrets.</i>

03:27.474 --> 03:30.876
<i> Like this man,</i>
<i> let's call him Henry,</i>

03:30.878 --> 03:33.946
<i>trying to find his way</i>
<i>on a remote Greek island.</i>

03:38.519 --> 03:41.987
<i>Even though evolution might seem</i>
<i>to mature us,</i>

03:41.989 --> 03:46.692
<i>there are still parts</i>
<i>of our brain that belong</i>
<i>to our reptile ancestors.</i>

03:48.395 --> 03:50.996
<i> Although we've convinced</i>
<i> ourselves that hate,</i>

03:50.998 --> 03:54.967
<i> revenge and nemesis</i>
<i> belong to the past,</i>

03:54.969 --> 03:59.338
<i>our ancient ancestors' blood</i>
<i>still runs in our veins,</i>

04:00.507 --> 04:03.709
<i>whether we like it or not.</i>

04:50.024 --> 04:52.357
[birds chirping]

04:59.833 --> 05:01.033
Hello?

05:11.712 --> 05:12.944
Hello?

05:13.947 --> 05:15.314
[door closes]

05:24.692 --> 05:25.957
Henry Maertens?

05:26.827 --> 05:27.926
Mr. Henderson.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.095
It's Alex.

05:32.399 --> 05:34.333
[clears throat]

05:34.335 --> 05:37.102
You found the way... obviously.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.420
Thank you very much.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.924
Oh, uh, perhaps
you'd prefer a cold drink?

05:58.926 --> 06:01.793
No, no, no. Tea will do nicely.
Thank you very much.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.903
A lighthouse?
It's quite something.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.473
I like to guide people.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.576
If they get too close,
I turn the light off.

06:19.913 --> 06:23.882
I prefer the solitude.
I hate neighbors.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.152
Some say I hate people
and that's...

06:28.422 --> 06:29.488
bloody true.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.426
Then this must be
the perfect spot.

06:34.862 --> 06:35.961
Exactly.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.597
And all of this is mine.

06:39.666 --> 06:43.101
And the olive grove
behind us.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.772
Some of the trees are
500 years old.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.875
They were here when
Columbus discovered America.

06:49.877 --> 06:53.979
And there's a small chapel
on the other side,
which is also mine.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.149
That's where I'm going
to be buried...

06:58.118 --> 06:59.551
when that day comes.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.688
So, my publisher
forwarded your letter.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.091
I can't remember
what you wrote,

07:06.093 --> 07:10.762
but I assume
you wanted to know how
to become a writer.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.731
Actually, no.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.467
It's-- [clears throat]

07:15.469 --> 07:17.068
It's actually more about
the story.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.937
The book I'm writing,
if it's any good

07:18.939 --> 07:21.740
or interesting enough.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.509
There are parallels to
<i>Gilliam's Temptation </i> in a way.

07:24.511 --> 07:26.211
I haven't read it
since I wrote it.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.217
Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Since you've come
all this way.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.955
It's about this couple...

07:38.225 --> 07:40.058
David and Eva.

07:41.462 --> 07:43.595
About their relationship,
you could say.

07:43.597 --> 07:48.700
David is a writer,
a rather successful one.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.969
And Eva is
a high school teacher,
no children.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.738
You're not gonna read
the whole book?

07:53.740 --> 07:56.241
Just bits and pieces,
so you get a feeling
for the story.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.511
Get on with it.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.949
[clears throat]

08:03.951 --> 08:06.651
They left
on the 15th of August,

08:06.653 --> 08:09.187
traveling in the car together,
just the two of them.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.823
David felt he really loved her.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.526
They had been married
for almost eight years.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.661
Of course,
they had their difficulties,

08:16.663 --> 08:20.098
but he'd never felt it
so strongly before.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.768
<i>In the midst</i>
<i>of this euphoric feeling,</i>
<i>there was a dissonance.</i>

08:23.770 --> 08:28.507
<i> As if one of the strings</i>
<i> in a chord was slightly</i>
<i> out of tune.</i>

08:28.509 --> 08:32.777
<i>It's difficult to pinpoint</i>
<i>more precisely where</i>
<i>that feeling originated.</i>

08:32.779 --> 08:38.582
<i>But he seemed to have discovered</i>
<i>a streak in his wife that</i>
<i>he'd never noticed before.</i>

08:38.585 --> 08:42.520
<i>Whether the actual change</i>
<i>was in her or in him,</i>
<i>he couldn't tell.</i>

08:45.959 --> 08:49.794
-Shall I switch on the radio?
-I'd rather not. Thank you.

08:57.671 --> 09:02.274
Gabber recommended
this gasthof just south
of Burghausen,

09:02.276 --> 09:03.942
which is supposed to be nice.

09:05.679 --> 09:09.848
Edelweiss,
good food apparently.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.784
After the shortcut,
we'll soon be on
the highway again.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.021
So we should get there
around...

09:17.057 --> 09:19.691
7:00, 7:30.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.630
Tomorrow's leg will be shorter.

09:26.900 --> 09:27.966
[sighs]

09:30.871 --> 09:34.205
I wonder how many gasthofs
are called Edelweiss,

09:34.207 --> 09:36.675
-must be hundreds.
-David, I've met someone else.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.051
Okay.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.887
[sighs]

09:48.889 --> 09:51.089
The way things have been
this past year, I--

09:51.091 --> 09:53.091
I-I have no choice

09:53.093 --> 09:54.893
and I'm going to leave you.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.227
[scoffs]

09:56.229 --> 09:59.831
Anyone I know?
It's, um, Mauritz.

10:00.334 --> 10:01.600
Mauritz Winkler?

10:03.170 --> 10:04.235
[sighs]

10:06.340 --> 10:07.672
[chuckles]

10:12.713 --> 10:16.781
Christ, why do all women
have to fall in love
with their therapist?

10:21.888 --> 10:25.023
You know as well as I do
that it doesn't mean anything.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.103
So why are we
on this fucking trip?

10:38.105 --> 10:40.805
Look, I wanted
to give it a try,
but it seems futile.

10:46.179 --> 10:49.948
I'm so sorry, I've just--
I've got to be honest with you.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.121
-[switches radio on]
-[classical music playing]

12:37.357 --> 12:39.124
Mr. Schwartz?

12:39.126 --> 12:42.127
Madame H.
[laughs] Welcome.

12:44.131 --> 12:45.530
Pleasant journey, I hope.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.800
It's the most wonderful road.
Isn't it?

12:48.802 --> 12:51.402
Can I get someone to help
with your bags?
No, I'll be fine.

12:51.404 --> 12:54.973
-Oh, you shouldn't trouble
yourself.
-No trouble at all.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.009
It's good to have you here.
And good to be here.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.245
[bell tolls]

13:04.985 --> 13:06.818
[moaning]

13:24.204 --> 13:26.905
[David moaning]

13:33.280 --> 13:34.846
[groans]

13:36.283 --> 13:38.950
[panting]

13:38.952 --> 13:40.151
[sighs]

13:46.326 --> 13:47.926
This was the last time.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.396
You can't be serious?

13:52.899 --> 13:55.300
[shower running]
Oh, I'm serious, David.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.335
[door closes]

14:03.410 --> 14:05.176
You belong to me, Eva.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.480
I love you.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.045
[coughing]

15:14.047 --> 15:15.513
Do you need the spray?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.316
Here.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.151
[continues coughing]
Have a seat.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.487
Here.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.958
Do you want some water?

15:27.661 --> 15:29.260
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.663
I'm fine. Thank you.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.349
Don't you understand
that it will pass?

15:51.351 --> 15:54.218
You know, you're just confused.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.554
[scoffs]

15:57.657 --> 15:59.057
I'm not confused.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.027
You know, I had other women.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.031
Why do you bring that up?

16:07.033 --> 16:08.499
Because I want you to know

16:08.501 --> 16:10.068
they never meant anything.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.003
Well, that's just
the difference.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.072
What is?

16:15.008 --> 16:16.474
I've only had one, David.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.676
And he means everything.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.589
If your life...

16:33.293 --> 16:36.427
is dark and then
a door suddenly opens, then...

16:38.565 --> 16:40.164
you have to move on.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.133
No, it's your responsibility.

16:42.135 --> 16:45.403
I think you owe
it to yourself.
[laughs]

16:45.405 --> 16:48.206
That sounds like something
Mauritz Winkler could have said.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.443
Do you mean your life
or whose life are
we talking about here?

16:52.445 --> 16:54.278
Our life.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.515
Our life together.
Bullshit. Fucking rubbish.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.418
We don't talk
to each other anymore.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.719
We don't stimulate
each other anymore.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.254
So you talk to him instead

17:03.256 --> 17:04.622
about our relationship?

17:04.624 --> 17:07.125
Don't you see it, David?

17:07.127 --> 17:10.194
It's so very obvious
right now.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.296
If we continue like this,
we'll just cease to exist.

17:12.298 --> 17:17.367
Those are just words
with no meaning.
They signify nothing.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.570
They signify everything.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.783
Hey!
Ow.

17:31.785 --> 17:34.118
What are you doing?

17:34.120 --> 17:37.522
I'm sorry. But you can't
just walk off like that.

17:39.793 --> 17:41.225
I'm pregnant.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.297
What? But...

17:46.299 --> 17:49.367
since when do you know?
It's not your child, David.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.109
I understand
if that makes you feel...

17:59.679 --> 18:00.745
unhappy.

18:02.148 --> 18:03.614
You know
I haven't felt ready.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.217
I haven't been able
to see myself with a child.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.086
You just didn't want
a child with me.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.353
It's not that simple.

18:09.355 --> 18:10.788
Go on, admit it.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.560
This is about me. Only me.

18:24.637 --> 18:28.339
[Henry]
<i>Twenty-four hours later,</i>
<i>Mauritz Winkler showed up.</i>

18:28.341 --> 18:31.142
<i>Booked himself into a hotel</i>
<i>in the next valley.</i>

18:34.414 --> 18:36.514
<i> The following morning,</i>
<i> she took the car...</i>

18:37.784 --> 18:40.318
<i>to see him, Mauritz Winkler.</i>

18:41.821 --> 18:44.322
[Alex] <i> So, he lets her leave.</i>

18:45.125 --> 18:47.792
<i>Just like that? What a wimp.</i>

18:47.794 --> 18:50.194
She's such a bitch. I like her.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.198
Do you want my comments now
or afterwards?

18:54.200 --> 18:56.234
Maybe I should go on.
Whatever.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.837
He decided to go for a walk
in the mountains.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.307
He didn't feel like being
around anyone.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.644
<i> He didn't want anything,</i>
<i> apart from Eva.</i>

19:07.914 --> 19:11.149
<i>When your soul is wounded,</i>
<i>physical activity can heal.</i>

19:13.853 --> 19:16.654
<i>And while he was sitting there,</i>
<i>he couldn't stop thinking about</i>

19:16.656 --> 19:19.657
<i> the skin on the inside</i>
<i> of Eva's thigh.</i>

19:19.659 --> 19:23.928
<i>If only the probing sensitive</i>
<i>touch of your fingertips</i>

19:23.930 --> 19:26.264
<i>could find that certain spot.</i>

19:28.201 --> 19:30.935
<i>Then of course Mauritz Winkler</i>
<i>invaded his thoughts.</i>

19:32.372 --> 19:36.374
<i> His fingers,</i>
<i> his body against hers.</i>

19:37.877 --> 19:41.445
<i>Perhaps it was there and then</i>
<i>that he made his decision.</i>

19:43.183 --> 19:46.551
<i> Afterwards,</i>
<i> his memory failed him.</i>

19:46.553 --> 19:50.755
<i> But it must have</i>
<i> come to him right there</i>
<i> at that very moment.</i>

19:50.757 --> 19:52.557
Mr. Schwartz.
Hello.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.959
Do you know if my wife
has returned yet?

19:54.961 --> 19:57.461
I'm sorry.

19:57.463 --> 20:00.698
I haven't seen either her
or the car since this morning.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.200
Okay. Thank you.

20:13.980 --> 20:18.382
[Henry] <i> How could he make</i>
<i>his inner being understand</i>
<i>that their love was over?</i>

20:20.587 --> 20:22.687
<i> He remembered</i>
<i> when he first met her...</i>

20:24.490 --> 20:28.359
<i> how he immediately knew</i>
<i> that this was the woman</i>
<i> he wanted to share</i>

20:28.361 --> 20:30.595
<i>the rest of his life with.</i>

20:31.931 --> 20:33.898
<i> He remembered</i>
<i> their first kiss...</i>

20:35.735 --> 20:37.735
<i>the first time they made love.</i>

20:39.606 --> 20:43.007
<i>He still loved her</i>
<i>with every bone in his body.</i>

20:43.009 --> 20:48.546
<i>And in a few months,</i>
<i>Eva would give birth</i>
<i>to a child that wasn't his.</i>

20:56.589 --> 20:59.824
<i>Almost blinded by jealousy,</i>

20:59.826 --> 21:03.594
<i> at the same time,</i>
<i> he was surprised</i>
<i> by his own rationality.</i>

21:05.498 --> 21:08.766
-[Alex] <i> But clearly,</i>
<i> he has a plan.</i>
-[Henry] <i> Yes.</i>

21:10.670 --> 21:12.370
After breakfast
the next morning,

21:12.372 --> 21:14.338
he says he's going
to take the car.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.374
Which she accepts.
So he drives off...

21:17.944 --> 21:21.512
kills that man, Winkler,
end of story, right?

21:26.386 --> 21:29.487
No, not quite. But...

21:29.489 --> 21:32.056
perhaps that should be
the feeling you get
when you read it.

21:32.058 --> 21:34.058
But that's not
what happens.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.594
Surprise me, Henry.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.432
[clears throat]

21:43.903 --> 21:48.072
<i> David had studied</i>
<i> the map carefully,</i>
<i> so he knew precisely</i>

21:48.074 --> 21:52.443
<i> the winding road</i>
<i> from the village</i>
<i> of Graues went uphill.</i>

21:52.445 --> 21:57.081
<i>There, some 500 meters below</i>
<i>in the next valley was</i>
<i>the Lauern reservoir.</i>

21:58.951 --> 22:01.752
<i> He had read about it</i>
<i> in the tourist brochure.</i>

22:01.754 --> 22:03.788
<i> Opaque green water.</i>

22:03.790 --> 22:07.058

<i> he had driven the car</i>
<i> all the way</i>

-[David] That's correct.
-[Inspector Mort] Okay.

28:31.777 --> 28:35.446
So there must be
a reason why your wife
simply up and left.

[Judit in English]
The bill, please.
Yeah. Coming.

42:15.700 --> 42:20.570
[David] <i> I started to wonder</i>
<i>about all this secrecy.</i>

42:20.572 --> 42:24.040
<i>Why had he sent the manuscript</i>
<i>to Kerr and Amundsen,</i>
<i>his German publisher,</i>

42:24.042 --> 42:27.977
<i>instead of his regular publisher</i>
<i>Otto Gerlach in Maardam?</i>

42:27.979 --> 42:30.313
<i>It certainly seemed strange.</i>

42:30.315 --> 42:34.784
<i>And could it really be true,</i>
<i>that this was the only copy?</i>

42:34.786 --> 42:37.120
<i> All I knew was</i>
<i> what Judit Kerr told me,</i>

42:37.122 --> 42:40.823
<i>and she seemed too excited</i>
<i>by the prospect</i>
<i>of the actual deal</i>

42:40.825 --> 42:43.560
<i>to question anything</i>
<i>about the background situation.</i>

43:14.826 --> 43:15.959

43:16.995 --> 43:19.062
-surveillance or missing?
-Missing.

I prefer missing persons.

43:22.634 --> 43:24.100

the last time?

43:24.102 --> 43:26.936
Three years ago,
or perhaps a bit more.

43:26.938 --> 43:29.138
Have you googled her?
She doesn't exist.

43:29.140 --> 43:30.640
Her maiden name?
Leuwe.

43:30.642 --> 43:32.108

Well, it's not that easy.

44:40.445 --> 44:43.379
[clears throat] I had made
some progress with Rein's novel.

44:43.381 --> 44:45.214
It had two sides to it.
One was...

44:46.418 --> 44:48.384
dreamlike and introverted...

44:49.721 --> 44:52.422
the other cynical and realistic.

44:52.424 --> 44:53.823
I've read it.

44:56.294 --> 44:59.262
Still I felt a great discomfort.

44:59.264 --> 45:03.066
Too many similarities
to my own story.
At the same time as--

45:05.737 --> 45:09.105
I think "frustrated" is
a better word.

45:10.709 --> 45:14.143
But it wasn't the novel itself,
even if it did influence me.

45:14.145 --> 45:15.978
This is getting better
and better.

45:20.218 --> 45:23.820
I'd started to believe
that the book was about
Germund Rein himself...

45:25.757 --> 45:27.356
<i>and about Mariam, his wife.</i>

45:27.358 --> 45:31.427
<i>And the most bizarre aspect</i>
<i>of it all was, of course,</i>

45:31.429 --> 45:35.765
<i>the parallel with my own life,</i>
<i>my situation with Eva.</i>

45:35.767 --> 45:39.736
<i>I was frustrated by the fact</i>
<i>that my search for her</i>
<i>remained without success.</i>

45:39.738 --> 45:45.808
<i>I can't really explain why</i>
<i>I reached out to Germund Rein's</i>
<i>wife, Mariam Kadhar.</i>

45:47.445 --> 45:49.912
<i> Maybe it was because</i>
<i> I couldn't find Eva</i>

45:49.914 --> 45:52.949
<i> that I decided</i>
<i> to find Mariam instead.</i>

45:52.951 --> 45:56.185
<i>There's no logic in it, I know.</i>

45:56.187 --> 46:01.224
<i> Maybe the content</i>
<i> of the book was merging</i>
<i> with my subconscious.</i>

46:01.226 --> 46:02.892
<i> I don't know.</i>

46:02.894 --> 46:05.261
<i>But her husband had disappeared</i>
<i>without a trace,</i>

46:05.263 --> 46:06.963
<i> and so had Eva.</i>

46:14.072 --> 46:17.807
Alex Henderson,
one of the few colleagues
my husband really valued.

46:17.809 --> 46:19.442
Yes, he's well
worth reading.

46:21.780 --> 46:24.313
Please take a seat.
Thank you.

46:27.919 --> 46:31.053
So you've translated
my husband's books?

46:31.055 --> 46:35.224
Only the two latest,
<i>The Red Sisters</i>
and <i> Kroull's Total Silence.</i>

46:35.226 --> 46:38.327
Do you know if they sold well
in your language?

46:38.329 --> 46:40.296
Um, not big editions.

46:40.298 --> 46:42.231
But he's regarded
by most well-informed people

46:42.233 --> 46:44.133
as one of
the great modern authors.

46:44.135 --> 46:46.035
Always up
for the Nobel prize.

46:46.037 --> 46:47.270
Hmm.

46:50.942 --> 46:55.044
I was just passing by and wanted
to present my condolences.

46:59.551 --> 47:02.051
It must be a heavy burden.

47:02.053 --> 47:04.086
I haven't got used
to it yet...

47:05.190 --> 47:07.156
even though several months
have passed.

47:07.158 --> 47:08.891
But on the other hand,

47:08.893 --> 47:11.561
I don't know why
one should get used to it.

47:13.498 --> 47:14.564
Hmm.

47:20.071 --> 47:21.971
Excuse me for asking this,

47:21.973 --> 47:24.607
do you know if he was writing
anything before he died?

47:27.145 --> 47:30.546
Yes, he was writing.
He always did.

47:30.548 --> 47:34.283
But we don't know what
became of it.
"Became of it"?

47:35.954 --> 47:37.453
He was busy with something.

47:37.455 --> 47:41.324
I don't know what it was.
He didn't tell me anything.

47:42.293 --> 47:43.960
But that's the way he was.

47:45.930 --> 47:47.563
I think he was pleased...

47:48.633 --> 47:50.266
with what he wrote.

47:51.603 --> 47:53.035
I could see it in him.

48:01.246 --> 48:03.045
But there's nothing left.

48:03.581 --> 48:04.947
Like I said...

48:08.253 --> 48:11.220
perhaps he burned it,
perhaps he...

48:13.291 --> 48:14.457
took it with him.

48:17.595 --> 48:19.228
I really don't know.

[David] <i> Mariam Kadhar...</i>

48:27.338 --> 48:30.239
<i>I felt pity for her,</i>
<i>even though I clearly understood</i>

48:30.241 --> 48:33.042
<i> that I couldn't</i>
<i> do anything to help her.</i>

48:33.044 --> 48:37.013
<i> But, most importantly,</i>
<i> I now understood that</i>
<i> apart from Judit Kerr,</i>

48:37.015 --> 48:39.248
<i> I was probably</i>
<i> the only living person</i>

<i>to have held Germund Rein's</i>
<i>final book in my hands.</i>

48:42.587 --> 48:44.320
<i> Why me?</i>

48:44.322 --> 48:46.055
<i>Mariam Kadhar didn't even know</i>

48:46.057 --> 48:48.524
<i> of its existence,</i>
<i> as far as I knew.</i>

48:50.261 --> 48:53.062
<i> I became so preoccupied</i>
<i> by my thoughts</i>

48:53.064 --> 48:56.065
<i>that I didn't notice</i>
<i>that someone was following me.</i>

48:56.067 --> 48:57.700
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if you've ever been shadowed,</i>

48:57.702 --> 49:01.070
<i>but somehow you can feel it</i>
<i>in your bones.</i>

49:01.973 --> 49:04.040
<i>It's not a pleasant feeling.</i>

49:06.277 --> 49:08.644
<i>My first thought, of course,</i>
<i>was that it had something to do</i>

49:08.646 --> 49:11.480
<i> with my visit to Mariam</i>
<i> or, more specifically,</i>

49:11.482 --> 49:13.983
<i>with Germund Rein's manuscript.</i>

49:13.985 --> 49:18.287
<i>But on second thought,</i>
<i>that didn't feel credible.</i>

49:18.289 --> 49:21.123
<i> Why would anyone go</i>
<i> to such lengths?</i>

49:22.694 --> 49:26.295
<i>Honestly, the whole setup</i>
<i>was pretty amateurish.</i>

<i>For a while, I pondered giving</i>
<i>in to Kerr's suggestion,</i>

50:18.216 --> 50:22.585
<i>to abandon Darke's model</i>
<i>and simply read</i>
<i>Rein's manuscript to the end.</i>

50:22.587 --> 50:26.088
<i>And, of course, there were</i>
<i>things in the manuscript</i>
<i>which got me thinking.</i>

50:28.393 --> 50:32.595
<i>As if the book's real story</i>
<i>was concealed between</i>
<i>the lines, as I said.</i>

50:35.299 --> 50:38.300
<i>But Darke maintained that it was</i>
<i>just that kind of thing,</i>

50:38.302 --> 50:40.503
<i> the hidden meaning</i>
<i> and deeper dimensions,</i>

50:40.505 --> 50:43.139
<i> that risked getting lost</i>
<i> if you gave in to it.</i>

50:50.081 --> 50:53.816

<i>No matter how I tried,</i>
<i>I couldn't make anything</i>
<i>comprehensible out of them.</i>

52:51.802 --> 52:54.637

Yesterday.

52:54.639 --> 52:57.773
He caught sight of her
in the underground,
followed her.

52:57.775 --> 53:02.545
She got out at Wassingen,
and went into one of
these high-rise buildings.

53:02.547 --> 53:04.747
He didn't have time to see
what floor she went to.

53:04.749 --> 53:08.651
Is he sure it was her?
Not at all...

53:08.653 --> 53:10.286

53:10.288 --> 53:11.820
along with the rest
of your description,

53:11.822 --> 53:15.324
so it's not completely
out of the question.

53:20.698 --> 53:22.298
So...

53:23.501 --> 53:25.834
Eva was still
in the land of the living,

53:26.904 --> 53:29.672
risen out of the reservoir
like Venus.

53:29.674 --> 53:30.773
Yes.

53:30.775 --> 53:32.474
That's what it looked like.

53:33.611 --> 53:35.945
Rather ambiguous feelings,
to be honest.

53:35.947 --> 53:38.380
You may suffer ambiguity...

57:59.810 --> 58:01.810
-Thank you.
-<i> I had, as I said...</i>

58:01.812 --> 58:03.912
-Enjoy.
<i>-...turned day into night.</i>

58:03.914 --> 58:05.881
-Thanks.
<i>-And clearly drunk too much.</i>

58:05.883 --> 58:07.649
<i> I couldn't sleep</i>
<i> without my pills.</i>

58:07.651 --> 58:11.119
<i>It had become a vicious circle,</i>
<i>pills and liquor.</i>

58:13.190 --> 58:18.126
<i>And my search for Eva</i>
<i>had become an obsessive routine,</i>

58:18.128 --> 58:20.696
<i>constantly compelled</i>
<i>to return to the same places</i>

58:20.698 --> 58:23.799
<i> over and over again,</i>
<i> waiting outside.</i>

58:24.902 --> 58:26.168
<i> For what?</i>

58:39.083 --> 58:43.218
<i>When I saw Germund Rein's widow</i>
<i>at the Nieuwe Halle all alone,</i>

58:43.220 --> 58:46.522
<i> I suddenly felt the urge</i>
<i> to rescue her.</i>

58:48.759 --> 58:52.694
<i>Was she as lonely as I was...</i>

58:52.696 --> 58:56.532
<i> or maybe she was the one</i>
<i> who would rescue me?</i>

59:38.842 --> 59:41.109
<i>I came to Maardam because</i>
<i>of my stupidity.</i>

59:41.111 --> 59:42.644
<i> I thought that...</i>

59:43.981 --> 59:45.681
I was going to find Eva.

59:46.350 --> 59:49.184
Eva?
I'm sorry. My wife.

59:50.921 --> 59:53.121
It's like finding
a needle in a haystack.

59:58.796 --> 01:00:03.732
Has she disappeared?
Disappeared. Perhaps dead.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.138
I really don't know.

01:00:12.643 --> 01:00:14.843
So how long has
she been missing?

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:16.812
It's been more
than three years.

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:20.148
Hmm.

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:31.293
I was on my way home,
but then I caught sight of you
outside the concert hall.

01:00:34.765 --> 01:00:36.331
Perhaps it was a sign.

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:45.307
You're so beautiful.

01:00:52.082 --> 01:00:53.348
[gasps]

01:00:57.021 --> 01:00:59.855
Sorry. I'm late.
No. That's okay.

01:00:59.857 --> 01:01:03.425
This is David Schwartz.
Otto Gerlach.

01:01:05.062 --> 01:01:06.161
Pleased to meet you.

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:11.667
I'll, uh,
fetch your coat.

01:01:11.669 --> 01:01:14.236
Mh-hmm.
Thank you.

01:01:18.075 --> 01:01:20.008
I want to see you again.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:22.911
Sorry.

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:26.081
I am not interested.

01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:32.354
[David] <i> I don't know</i>
<i> what I was expecting.</i>

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:36.792
<i>As I said, I'd been drinking</i>
<i>way too much the last few weeks.</i>

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:38.360
<i> That had to change now.</i>

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:43.165
<i>I also needed to concentrate</i>
<i>on Rein's manuscript.</i>

01:01:48.105 --> 01:01:50.272
<i> It was necessary.</i>

01:01:50.274 --> 01:01:54.910
<i>I was behind with my work.</i>
<i>I'd been neglecting it lately.</i>

01:01:54.912 --> 01:01:59.014
<i>In spite of the circumstances,</i>
<i>I became more and more caught up</i>
<i>in my work.</i>

01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:02.784
<i>In less than three days,</i>
<i>I had finalized</i>
<i>the translation of Rein's book.</i>

01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:10.158
<i>But I just couldn't let go</i>
<i>of those underlined words.</i>

01:02:12.196 --> 01:02:14.930
<i> The words appeared</i>
<i> one after the other</i>

01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:17.866
<i> at first sight</i>
<i> in no particular order.</i>

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:22.771
<i>Maybe there was</i>
<i>a hidden message after all.</i>

01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:30.345
[clears throat]

01:02:40.991 --> 01:02:44.860
<i>"Thirty centimeters west of...</i>

<i> Behrensee.</i>

01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:59.975
<i> The sudden realization</i>
<i> terrified me.</i>

01:03:01.812 --> 01:03:05.080
<i>At that point,</i>
<i>I could easily have taken</i>
<i>the first flight home,</i>

01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:11.186
<i>but my search for Eva had now</i>
<i>turned into something new</i>
<i>and very different.</i>

01:03:11.188 --> 01:03:13.155
<i> I didn't dare e-mail</i>
<i> the translated script,</i>

01:03:13.157 --> 01:03:15.857

<i>in the architect's flat,</i>

01:03:15.859 --> 01:03:19.928
<i>made a hard copy,</i>
<i>and sent it by courier</i>
<i>to Judit Kerr, the publisher.</i>

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:22.130
You take that road there,
and then you turn.

01:03:25.502 --> 01:03:28.837
<i>I knew that Rein and Mariam</i>
<i>had a summer house by the sea</i>

01:03:28.839 --> 01:03:31.940
<i>just outside a small village</i>
<i>called Behrensee.</i>

01:03:36.079 --> 01:03:38.046
<i> The name of the house</i>
<i> was Cherry Garden,</i>

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:41.516
<i>and was reputed to be</i>
<i>something quite outstanding.</i>

01:03:41.518 --> 01:03:47.355
<i> A secluded haven where</i>
<i> Germund Rein produced</i>
<i> most of his works,</i>

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:49.291
<i> according to rumors.</i>

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:53.261
<i> A remote location which,</i>

01:03:53.263 --> 01:03:56.131
<i>exactly as I had been led</i>
<i>to understand,</i>

01:03:56.133 --> 01:03:57.833
<i> would take some finding.</i>

01:03:58.502 --> 01:04:00.235
<i> But I found it.</i>

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:06.308
<i>And I also found the sundial.</i>

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:27.596
<i>My inner voice urged me</i>
<i>to forget about the whole thing</i>
<i>and return to the city.</i>

01:04:29.132 --> 01:04:31.566
<i> But for some reason,</i>
<i> I couldn't let it go.</i>

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.235
<i> I had to find out.</i>

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:37.205
<i>So I waited for nightfall.</i>

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:41.643
<i> And once again sneaked</i>
<i> into the garden.</i>

01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:49.117
<i>"Thirty centimeters west</i>
<i>of the sundial in Behrensee."</i>

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:53.154
<i>I found what Germund Rein</i>

01:05:11.575 --> 01:05:13.642
<i> The next day I went</i>
<i> to the police.</i>

01:05:13.644 --> 01:05:15.510

01:05:55.152 --> 01:05:58.286
[Judit in German]

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:47.635
[in English] So, Mr. Schwartz,

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:51.339
you translated Germund Rein's
last book?

01:06:52.075 --> 01:06:53.174
Yeah.

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:55.176
The book that is
the reason

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:57.512
we are all gathered
in this courtroom today?

01:06:58.382 --> 01:06:59.614
I guess so, yeah.

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:03.752
Why do you suppose Germund Rein

01:07:03.754 --> 01:07:07.389
only wanted the book to be
published as a translation?

01:07:07.391 --> 01:07:09.691
I thought that was clear.

01:07:11.161 --> 01:07:13.361
Otto Gerlach was his publisher.

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.430
Can you clarify what you mean?

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:20.502
I assume Rein was afraid
the book,

01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:23.705
the manuscript would disappear,
never be published.

01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:25.473
And why would it disappear?

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:28.043
Because of its content...

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:32.280
-compromising information.
-Compromising for whom?

01:07:32.282 --> 01:07:34.149
I really don't have anything
to do with this.

01:07:34.151 --> 01:07:36.251
I put it to you that this was
compromising information

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:37.318
for the accused...

01:07:39.089 --> 01:07:42.090
Mariam Kadhar and Otto Gerlach.

01:07:42.092 --> 01:07:44.292
I assume.
Your Honor,

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:47.562
my client's name isn't
even mentioned in the book
in question.

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:49.230
It's...

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:52.300
[judge] Let the witness
elaborate his assertion.

01:07:56.773 --> 01:07:59.374
In the beginning,
it was just subtle hints.

01:07:59.376 --> 01:08:03.478
[clears throat]
But the more I read,
the more obvious it became.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:06.714
[lawyer] You mean
there are passages
in the book that underline

01:08:06.716 --> 01:08:08.483
the theory of the accusation?

01:08:08.485 --> 01:08:10.085
I guess you could say so.

01:08:13.156 --> 01:08:15.256
Can you give the court
an example of this?

01:08:17.527 --> 01:08:20.328
If I may borrow the book.

01:08:33.643 --> 01:08:35.376
[clears throat]

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:38.113
I'm quoting from page 37.

01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:45.153
"One morning she goes
to the square to buy vegetables.

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:49.457
Always these vegetables
that must never be less
than a day old,

her <i> memento mori.</i>

He goes through her belongings.

01:08:57.267 --> 01:08:58.765
She knows
he would never do this,

01:08:58.768 --> 01:09:01.202
so she has never bothered
to hide anything.

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:07.274
He finds letters, four letters,
three are clear enough,

01:09:07.277 --> 01:09:09.611
the fourth is about
a conspiracy.

01:09:10.714 --> 01:09:13.848
They obviously want
to see him dead.

01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:17.652
He puts the letters in a folder,
drives into town to copy them.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:20.755
He thinks
he's got plenty of time.
She's probably fucking G,

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:24.826
reaping his vicious semen
between her wide open legs.

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:28.563
Puts the originals back
among her knickers
in the chest of drawers

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:31.533
and puts the copies
in a plastic bag.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:36.304
Goes to the shed,
fetches a spade,

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:39.374
finds a place with soft soil,

01:09:39.376 --> 01:09:42.743
and buries his treasure."

01:09:42.746 --> 01:09:45.613
Can you tell me what you did
after you read this?

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:47.881
I went to check it out.

01:09:47.884 --> 01:09:52.353
According to the hidden code
I told you about.

01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:55.290
So you found the letters

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:58.826
where the hidden code
in the manuscript said
it would be?

01:09:59.563 --> 01:10:01.396
Mh-hmm.

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:05.533
The letters Mariam Kadhar
and Otto Gerlach had exchanged?

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:08.303
-Yes.
-Did you study the content?

01:10:08.905 --> 01:10:10.271
Eventually.

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:19.514
And I came to the conclusion
that the information
in the book was true.

01:10:20.584 --> 01:10:23.318
And what exactly, Mr. Schwartz,

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:27.355
does it say
in Germund Rein's book?

01:10:29.593 --> 01:10:33.695
It says that M and O
planned to kill Germund Rein.

01:10:35.632 --> 01:10:37.565
-[crowd murmuring]
-Thank you.

01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:40.802
No further questions.

[judge] Mr. Neumann-Hansen.

01:10:49.813 --> 01:10:51.813
You found these...

01:10:52.816 --> 01:10:56.517
handwritten notes
and letters

01:10:56.519 --> 01:10:58.920
buried just west of
the sundial at Behrensee?

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:01.322
-Yeah.
-Didn't that seem
strange to you?

01:11:02.559 --> 01:11:03.658
In what sense?

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.026
Well, during the inquiry,

01:11:05.028 --> 01:11:06.828
the police went through
all e-mails

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:09.264
between Otto Gerlach
and my client.

01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:11.766
And, yes,
there's correspondence.
Plenty of it.

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:13.835
But it's
all professional.

01:11:13.837 --> 01:11:19.340
Nothing like what you found
in your letters.

01:11:19.342 --> 01:11:21.376
Strange, wouldn't you say?
I mean,

01:11:21.378 --> 01:11:24.345
it's so much easier
to send an e-mail these days.

01:11:24.347 --> 01:11:28.650
Excuse me. But I would like
to remind you all that
I've only done my civic duty.

01:11:28.652 --> 01:11:30.885
I went to the police
with the material
I happened to have.

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:33.321
The same thing any of you
would have done.

01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:38.926
No more questions.

Please leave.

01:14:55.225 --> 01:14:56.858
I don't want to answer
that question.

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:59.894
You're accused of murder,
Mrs. Kadhar.

01:15:02.065 --> 01:15:04.732
Did you kill your husband?

01:15:06.202 --> 01:15:08.536
I did not kill my husband.

01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:15.776
[David]
<i>Although she terrified me,</i>
<i>I found myself increasingly</i>

01:15:15.778 --> 01:15:17.945
<i>and irresistibly fascinated.</i>

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:20.181
<i> I couldn't fight it.</i>

01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:24.252
I couldn't come to terms
with the thought

01:15:24.254 --> 01:15:26.721
that she could have done
something so--

01:15:29.292 --> 01:15:31.893
I don't know. I just wanted
to take her in my arms...

01:15:33.730 --> 01:15:37.231
even though she rejected me
so very clearly.

01:15:37.233 --> 01:15:43.271
So, what makes you believe
a woman like Mariam Kadhar

01:15:43.273 --> 01:15:46.207
could be interested in
a man like you?

01:15:47.944 --> 01:15:52.780
Interesting parallel
with the wife, by the way.

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:57.585
You keep yourself
quite occupied,

01:15:57.587 --> 01:15:59.787
avenging yourself
on women who dump you.

01:16:01.858 --> 01:16:03.724
First Eva,
then Mariam.

01:16:04.761 --> 01:16:06.727
Well, I see a pattern emerging.

01:16:07.864 --> 01:16:09.096
Don't you?

01:16:11.267 --> 01:16:15.303
Anyway, in view of all
the media attention
you were getting,

01:16:15.305 --> 01:16:17.972
if the wife, Eva,

01:16:17.974 --> 01:16:21.676
if she were alive and kicking
and living in Maardam,

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:23.077
surely she would've
become aware

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:24.912
of your poster boy status
by now?

01:16:25.848 --> 01:16:27.014
Possibly.

01:16:29.786 --> 01:16:32.653
But by that point,
I'd given up all thought of her.

01:16:34.057 --> 01:16:35.222
Thank you.

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:41.128
My thoughts were somewhere
completely different.

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:45.199
[easy piano music playing]

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.607
[doorbell rings]

01:17:03.052 --> 01:17:05.653
David Schwartz,
what do you think about
the possible sentence?

01:17:05.655 --> 01:17:07.188
Mariam Kadhar
and Otto Gerlach.
I've got nothing to--

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:08.689
After all,
it's because of you

01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:10.391
they might end up
behind bars.

01:17:10.393 --> 01:17:12.326
How do you feel about that?

01:17:15.264 --> 01:17:19.867
The court finds the accused
guilty of first degree murder.

01:17:19.869 --> 01:17:23.971
The defendants Otto Gerlach
and Mariam Kadhar

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:26.974
are each sentenced to 12 years.

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:33.748
[reporter] David.

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:36.684
David Schwartz?
Twelve years behind bars.

01:17:36.686 --> 01:17:39.253
How does it feel to be
the hero of the day, David?
No comment.

01:17:39.255 --> 01:17:42.289
Both defense lawyers have
already lodged appeals.
Any comments?

01:17:43.192 --> 01:17:44.725
There you have it.

01:17:44.727 --> 01:17:46.961
I just wanted to get away
from the place

01:17:46.963 --> 01:17:50.197
and Mariam's accusing eyes
burned into my very core.

01:17:51.434 --> 01:17:53.701
It felt like
I was going to pieces.

01:17:53.703 --> 01:17:57.171
So, you really believe
you were the chosen one?

01:17:58.741 --> 01:18:00.775
You don't realize that...

01:18:00.777 --> 01:18:04.378
anybody could've dug up
those letters sooner
or later?

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.815
What?
Well, you're a nobody,
David.

01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:10.351
[scoffs]

01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:12.420
I understand that
this isn't about me.

01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:15.289
I'm completely aware
of that.

01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:19.794
I mean, the fact that
you fell for Mariam Kadhar,

01:18:19.796 --> 01:18:22.296
it just shows what
a pushover you really are.

01:18:22.298 --> 01:18:25.099
I mean,
you held all the cards.

01:18:25.101 --> 01:18:27.234
Why didn't you just torch
the letters?

01:18:27.236 --> 01:18:28.436
Yes.

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:33.407
Maybe I should have.

01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:35.242
Or maybe you're just
not that bright.

01:18:38.081 --> 01:18:41.215
I mean, one moment
you're a shrewd calculator,

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:42.950
the next you're
a fucking wimp.

01:18:44.187 --> 01:18:45.453
[scoffs]

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:49.223
I'm too old
for this kind of crap.

01:19:00.036 --> 01:19:03.738
So, uh, you're hot stuff
right now.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:06.741
[chuckles] Thank you.
Thank you, Doris.

01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:31.465
That man. He's following me,
on several occasions.

01:19:31.467 --> 01:19:33.801
I'm certain of it.
He walks with a limp.

01:19:33.803 --> 01:19:34.969
You can't mistake that.

01:19:34.971 --> 01:19:36.170
Have you any idea why?

01:19:36.172 --> 01:19:37.838
I wouldn't come
to you if I had.

01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:42.109
Can you help me
with this?

01:19:44.046 --> 01:19:45.246
Do you know who he is?

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:49.884
You're a public figure now.

01:19:49.886 --> 01:19:51.485
You never told me
what profession you were in.

01:19:51.487 --> 01:19:53.487
'Cause it's got nothing
to do with Eva.

01:19:55.391 --> 01:19:56.991
Do you know who he is?

01:19:58.861 --> 01:20:00.261
Let's do it this way.

01:20:01.197 --> 01:20:02.797
I'll see what I can do.

01:20:03.566 --> 01:20:05.065
But it will cost you.

01:20:05.067 --> 01:20:08.002
And I can't promise
any results.

01:20:09.539 --> 01:20:10.971
I'll call you?

01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:21.115
One lasagna to go, please.

01:20:21.117 --> 01:20:23.083
[Alex] <i> The limping man.</i>

01:20:24.253 --> 01:20:27.054
<i> Interesting title</i>

01:20:27.056 --> 01:20:32.059
-<i> No, seriously, who was he?</i>

01:20:32.061 --> 01:20:35.229

01:20:49.545 --> 01:20:52.913

01:20:52.915 --> 01:20:56.483
-[man] <i> The whole pencil?</i>

01:20:56.485 --> 01:20:59.453

<i> The slow recovery.</i>

01:22:24.206 --> 01:22:27.241
<i> Now, I was edging closer</i>

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:39.119
<i>In my defense, I would like</i>

01:22:40.723 --> 01:22:43.324
<i> Methodical, unhurried.</i>

01:22:43.326 --> 01:22:48.429
<i>I allowed alcohol</i>

01:22:54.637 --> 01:22:57.504

01:23:03.346 --> 01:23:06.747

01:23:54.597 --> 01:23:56.096
[sighs]

01:24:24.093 --> 01:24:25.793
[phone rings]

01:24:35.638 --> 01:24:37.538
[ringing continues]

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:48.515
-Hello?
-Well, well, David Schwartz.

01:24:48.517 --> 01:24:51.385
I first thought, of course,
that it had something to do
with your job.

01:24:51.387 --> 01:24:53.787
That publisher doesn't seem
to look upon you very kindly.

01:24:53.789 --> 01:24:55.522
But it wasn't?
So who was he then?

01:24:55.524 --> 01:24:58.158
Why is he following me?
One thing at a time.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.526
I recognized the man
in the photo.

01:24:59.528 --> 01:25:01.462
He's a former police
commissioner.

01:25:01.464 --> 01:25:04.698
Now retired
and actually freelancing
in my line of business,

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.733
so I contacted him.

01:25:06.735 --> 01:25:09.503
And he was in fact hired
to follow you.

01:25:09.505 --> 01:25:13.273
And naturally,
he didn't want to reveal
the identity of his client.

01:25:13.776 --> 01:25:15.209
But?

01:25:15.211 --> 01:25:16.877
Everything has a price.

01:25:16.879 --> 01:25:19.513
And I'd suppose that money
wasn't an issue in this--

01:25:19.515 --> 01:25:21.115
I already told you that.

01:25:24.253 --> 01:25:27.788
But it seems as if both of you
wanted to find each other.

01:25:29.892 --> 01:25:31.158
Who?

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:32.826
Oh, you and Eva.

01:25:34.563 --> 01:25:36.163
Eva hired him?

01:25:36.165 --> 01:25:37.664
Exactly.

01:25:37.666 --> 01:25:40.634
When my collaborator
saw her in Wassingen,

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:43.804
she wasn't on her way home.
She has an apartment,
but on the other side of town.

01:25:43.806 --> 01:25:46.707
She was simply on her way
to see my colleague.

01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:48.342
He had an office there
at the time.

01:25:51.514 --> 01:25:54.281
She spotted you here
in Maardam,

01:25:54.283 --> 01:25:56.683
hired him to keep track
of your whereabouts.

01:25:57.419 --> 01:25:58.685
Edita Sobranska?

01:25:59.788 --> 01:26:01.488
I guess she changed her name.

01:26:50.573 --> 01:26:51.705
[sighs]

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.220
Stay there.

01:27:20.903 --> 01:27:22.703
[scoffs]

01:27:22.705 --> 01:27:24.271
So, you decided to come now?

01:27:25.007 --> 01:27:26.273
Yes.

01:27:27.443 --> 01:27:28.775
Here I am.

01:27:30.946 --> 01:27:32.746
[child laughs]

01:27:51.567 --> 01:27:54.001
Hello.
Hello.

01:28:00.476 --> 01:28:02.442
You've been living here
a long time?

01:28:03.812 --> 01:28:04.945
Three years.

01:28:07.816 --> 01:28:11.351
-Ever since...
-Ever since then. Yes.

01:28:11.887 --> 01:28:13.387
Come on.

01:28:16.525 --> 01:28:18.325
We're going for a nap now.

01:28:18.327 --> 01:28:19.793
Sleep tight, sweetheart.

01:28:20.696 --> 01:28:23.497
And I'll leave
the door open.

01:28:33.876 --> 01:28:35.475
I just made some teas.

01:29:05.374 --> 01:29:07.841
So, how long
are you staying?
Sorry?

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:09.810
In Maardam.

01:29:09.812 --> 01:29:11.745
How long are
you gonna be staying?

01:29:11.747 --> 01:29:13.847
Not much longer.

01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:17.617
My job is finished.
So I've heard.

01:29:17.619 --> 01:29:20.020
Do you really believe
they killed him? Rein?

01:29:20.923 --> 01:29:22.622
Yes.

01:29:22.624 --> 01:29:24.491
And then
she commits suicide.

01:29:24.493 --> 01:29:25.926
I've left all that
behind me now.

01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:36.136
What's her name?

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.106
Paula.

01:29:40.509 --> 01:29:42.042
She's almost three now.

01:29:42.044 --> 01:29:43.477
I thought so.

01:29:45.881 --> 01:29:47.547
Is everything all right?

01:29:49.084 --> 01:29:51.084
She's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:29:54.123 --> 01:29:56.623
What happened, Eva?

01:30:02.131 --> 01:30:03.797
What happened in Graues?

01:30:05.968 --> 01:30:08.869
I think you should
leave now.
I need to know what happened.

01:30:08.871 --> 01:30:11.138
You ask me
what happened?

01:30:11.140 --> 01:30:13.473
You have no right
whatsoever.

01:30:13.475 --> 01:30:14.908
No right?

01:30:21.483 --> 01:30:22.916
Maybe that's
the worst part of it all

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:25.986
that you don't
even understand that.

01:30:25.988 --> 01:30:28.922
Do you know how many times
I've thought about this, David?

01:30:33.095 --> 01:30:35.829
What if we'd bump into
each other one day, you and I?

01:30:36.965 --> 01:30:40.033
Even if it's the last thing
I ever wanted.

01:30:43.172 --> 01:30:44.538
But if...

01:30:46.074 --> 01:30:48.809
only a chance in a million
that it would happen,

01:30:48.811 --> 01:30:50.644
but still a possibility.

01:30:50.646 --> 01:30:53.847
In a tram, or an airport
somewhere in the world.

01:30:53.849 --> 01:30:56.016
Suddenly you'd stand
in front of me and ask...

01:30:57.085 --> 01:30:58.185
"What happened?"

01:30:59.521 --> 01:31:00.687
What happened?

01:31:02.724 --> 01:31:04.090
What should I say?

01:31:05.994 --> 01:31:07.594
What should I do?

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:16.002
After a hundred
sleepless nights, David...

01:31:17.473 --> 01:31:21.708
I've decided that
I'm not gonna tell you.

01:31:26.515 --> 01:31:30.250
You're gonna have to live
with that uncertainty
for the rest of your life.

01:31:34.056 --> 01:31:37.123
You can see that
as some sort of punishment
if you want.

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.126
Eva.
And I want you
to leave now.

01:31:43.232 --> 01:31:44.731
I'm not gonna tell you, David.

01:31:46.034 --> 01:31:47.501
Never ever.

01:32:11.293 --> 01:32:12.659
[sighs]

01:32:15.597 --> 01:32:17.597
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

01:32:18.834 --> 01:32:20.867
You come here,

01:32:20.869 --> 01:32:25.272
accept my hospitality
and my advice,

01:32:25.274 --> 01:32:28.208
and in exchange you offer me--

01:32:30.112 --> 01:32:32.112
Bloody unforgivable...

01:32:32.114 --> 01:32:34.614
to fritter away
a story like that.

01:32:34.616 --> 01:32:36.950
A sneeze on the radio.

01:32:36.952 --> 01:32:39.152
A cough.
A cough.

01:32:39.154 --> 01:32:43.590
What the fuck?
You can't just let it run out
into the sand like fucking piss.

01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.726
You just left them there

01:32:46.728 --> 01:32:49.296
without a clue as
to what really happened.

01:32:49.298 --> 01:32:50.864
Hmm...

01:32:51.934 --> 01:32:56.770
Are you familiar
with my modest ideas

01:32:56.772 --> 01:32:59.005
in the handbook of life?
[chuckling] Yeah.

01:33:00.676 --> 01:33:03.009
Of course. [clears throat]

01:33:04.646 --> 01:33:07.948
But they're hardly yours,
are they?
You always have a choice.

01:33:09.718 --> 01:33:12.352
Either you write
your own script...

01:33:15.123 --> 01:33:17.724
or you live according
to someone else's.

01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:30.637
How did you figure me out?

01:33:49.024 --> 01:33:51.825
I realize you don't have
a very high opinion of me,

01:33:51.827 --> 01:33:53.793
a simple translator.

01:33:55.163 --> 01:33:57.197
But I've read
and translated your words.

01:33:57.199 --> 01:34:00.300
I spent months, years,
getting to know your style
and your wording,

01:34:00.302 --> 01:34:02.869
it's out there...

01:34:02.871 --> 01:34:07.107
whether you like it or not,
whether you call yourself
Germund Rein or Alex Henderson.

01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:14.648
Was this complicated intrigue
really necessary?

01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:17.150
Mm-mm.
Isn't that obvious?

01:34:19.121 --> 01:34:20.787
What the hell
do you think?

01:34:22.057 --> 01:34:24.991
Suspicion has
to grow slowly.

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:26.826
Do you think any of this
would have worked

01:34:26.828 --> 01:34:29.996
if they found themselves
in the limelight too soon?

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:34.034
They never planned to kill you,
did they?
You know as well as I do.

01:34:34.036 --> 01:34:35.669
This is how
it had to end.

01:34:35.671 --> 01:34:39.339
The end speaks
for itself, right?

01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:43.243
What about Mariam's death?

01:34:44.446 --> 01:34:47.814
Well, that's got nothing
to do with it.

01:34:51.153 --> 01:34:52.752
She wrote that chapter.

01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:55.455
It wasn't in my script.

01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:01.394
Who the hell are you
to judge me?

01:35:01.396 --> 01:35:05.098
You actually tried to kill
your own wife for fuck's sake.

01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:09.302
And here she is in the pink,

01:35:09.304 --> 01:35:12.338
living in domestic bliss
with Morris Wanker--

01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:14.474
Winkler,
whatever his fucking name is.

01:35:16.478 --> 01:35:19.179
This isn't how you thought
your story would end...

01:35:20.482 --> 01:35:22.415
is it? Hmm?

01:35:22.417 --> 01:35:28.054
David? Never even knowing
what really happened?

01:35:33.228 --> 01:35:35.061
I need a proper drink.

01:35:53.915 --> 01:35:57.283
[cabinet rattling]

01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:13.933
So, how did it happen?
What?

01:36:13.935 --> 01:36:15.435
The flight?

01:36:15.437 --> 01:36:18.404
There wasn't any flight.

01:36:18.406 --> 01:36:22.942
Alex Henderson had been
in existence for many years
by that time.

01:36:22.944 --> 01:36:24.911
Even you should've realized
that by now.

01:36:24.913 --> 01:36:29.048
He took a plane to Athens.
That's all.

01:36:29.050 --> 01:36:32.819
You weren't drunk that night
in Behrensee, were you?

01:36:33.321 --> 01:36:35.922
Tipsy, at most.

01:36:35.924 --> 01:36:37.557
Then you were
bloody lucky.

01:36:38.994 --> 01:36:41.094
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

01:36:42.130 --> 01:36:43.196
Bullshit.

01:36:54.042 --> 01:36:58.211
Feels like you owe me
a debt of gratitude,
don't you think?

01:36:58.213 --> 01:37:01.381
I was the one who did
your dirty work.
Me? Thank you?

01:37:03.485 --> 01:37:06.519
Should the puppeteer
thank the puppet for her dance?

01:37:14.563 --> 01:37:15.962
I think it's time I left.

01:37:15.964 --> 01:37:17.597
[clears throat]

01:37:19.201 --> 01:37:22.168
I must find my way
back to the road
before it gets too dark.

01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:24.270
You realize
there's little point
in squealing.

01:37:24.272 --> 01:37:27.440
My identity is watertight,
has been for a long time.

01:37:27.442 --> 01:37:28.908
So I've understood.

01:37:29.845 --> 01:37:31.377
Good.

01:37:31.379 --> 01:37:35.114
Being a bad loser
can be so unbecoming.

01:37:36.985 --> 01:37:38.218
It's just that...

01:37:40.288 --> 01:37:43.356
I've found it really hard
to accept Mariam's fate.

01:37:45.193 --> 01:37:48.595
You didn't kill her,
neither did I.

01:37:55.537 --> 01:37:56.903
What about Germund Rein?

01:37:58.006 --> 01:37:59.138
He's dead.

01:39:57.158 --> 01:39:58.725
[quiet gasping]

01:40:16.578 --> 01:40:18.277
[labored breathing]

01:40:36.264 --> 01:40:38.731
[labored breathing continues]

01:41:53.741 --> 01:41:56.476
[gentle piano music playing]
