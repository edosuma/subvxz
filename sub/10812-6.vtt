00:41.207 --> 00:42.792
JUST ASK CANDY BOYD.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.711
{\an5}SHE'S BEEN RUNNING
BOYD FUNERAL HOME

00:44.794 --> 00:47.589
{\an5}IN LINWOOD, CALIFORNIA,
FOR OVER 15 YEARS,

I PAID HER A VISIT

{\an5}WITH AN IDEA TO MAKE
HER BUSINESS EVEN BETTER.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.928
{\an5}UNBEKNOWNST TO CANDY,
I WENT BY THE NIGHT BEFORE

00:54.179 --> 00:56.598
{\an5}IN MY USUAL DISGUISE
TO SCOPE THINGS OUT,

00:56.681 --> 00:58.183
{\an5}BUT MY BEARD
WAS COMING LOOSE,

00:58.266 --> 00:59.809
{\an5}SO I WAS TOO AFRAID
TO GO INSIDE,

01:00.059 --> 01:01.811
{\an5}SO I ENDED UP JUST
CHECKING OUT THEIR WEBSITE

01:01.895 --> 01:04.813
{\an5}TO LEARN MORE
ABOUT THE BUSINESS.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.816
{\an5}SO BASICALLY,
YOUR BUSINESS IS DEATH.

01:07.066 --> 01:08.818
{\an8}- CORRECT. CORRECT.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.654
{\an8}- AND THAT MUST BE
BITTERSWEET FOR YOU.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.782
- I MUST SAY, IT IS.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.826
{\an5}- BITTER BECAUSE PEOPLE DIE...
- RIGHT.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.037
{\an5}- AND SWEET...
- RIGHT.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.914
{\an5}- BECAUSE
YOU'RE MAKING MONEY.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.832
{\an5}- EXACTLY, EXACTLY.
- SO IT'S HARD,

01:22.916 --> 01:24.751
{\an5}BECAUSE YOU MAYBE GET EXCITED
WHEN SOMEONE DIES.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.337
{\an5}- RIGHT, EXACTLY.
- BECAUSE YOU'RE LIKE,

01:27.420 --> 01:29.255
{\an5}"I'M GONNA PROFIT FROM THIS..."
- RIGHT, EXACTLY, EXACTLY.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.257

- IT'S A BALANCE.

{\an5}- MONEY WAS CLEARLY
IMPORTANT TO MRS. BOYD,

01:37.972 --> 01:39.724
{\an5}AND I SAW SHE WAS MISSING OUT
ON SOME PROFITABLE SERVICES

01:39.808 --> 01:41.601
TO OFFER HER CUSTOMERS.

01:41.684 --> 01:43.812
{\an5}THE PLAN--I WANTED HER
TO GIVE PEOPLE

01:43.895 --> 01:46.439
{\an5}THE OPTION
OF BUYING MORE FRIENDS.

01:46.523 --> 01:49.484
{\an5}- BUYING MORE FRIENDS?
- BASICALLY,

01:49.567 --> 01:51.861
{\an5}WHEN YOU DIE,
YOU WANT TO HAVE

01:51.945 --> 01:53.530
{\an5}A LOT OF PEOPLE
COME TO YOUR FUNERAL,

01:53.613 --> 01:55.073
{\an5}BECAUSE IT SHOWS
THAT YOU'RE WELL-LIKED.

01:55.156 --> 01:56.866
{\an5}- CORRECT.
- SO I THINK YOU SHOULD

01:56.950 --> 01:59.035
{\an5}GIVE PEOPLE THE OPTION
OF PAYING FOR ACTORS

01:59.118 --> 02:00.912
{\an5}TO BE FAMILY OR FRIENDS
AT A FUNERAL.

02:01.162 --> 02:03.373
{\an5}- OH, I SEE, I SEE.
- LIKE, TO FILL THE ROOM.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.250
{\an5}DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
- YEAH.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.293
{\an5}- AND IT COULD BE
A VERY PROFITABLE ADD-ON SERVICE

02:07.377 --> 02:09.044
{\an5}TO OFFER TO PEOPLE.
- WELL, I MEAN,

02:09.127 --> 02:12.382
{\an5}IT IS PRETTY INTERESTING.
I DON'T KNOW--

02:12.465 --> 02:16.052
{\an5}- I'D LOVE TO DEMONSTRATE
FOR YOU WHAT IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.054
- OH, SURE. THAT'D BE GREAT.

02:18.137 --> 02:19.931
{\an5}-AND MAYBE THAT WOULD
HELP SELL IT TO YOU.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.307
{\an5}- I'M NOT SAYING "NO."
LET'S JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS,

02:21.391 --> 02:22.684
AND, YOU KNOW--

02:22.767 --> 02:24.394
- TO DEMONSTRATE MY IDEA,

02:24.477 --> 02:26.896
{\an5}I NEEDED TO ASSEMBLE
A DREAM TEAM OF ACTORS

02:26.980 --> 02:28.898
{\an5}WHO KNOW HOW TO CONDUCT
THEMSELVES AT A FUNERAL,

02:28.982 --> 02:31.025
{\an5}SO I MET
WITH SOME PROFESSIONAL ACTORS

02:31.109 --> 02:32.819
TO PICK OUT THE BEST.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.362
{\an5}THIS WIDOW
JUST LOST HER HUSBAND.

02:34.445 --> 02:37.866
{\an5}- OKAY.
- SO MAKE HER FEEL BETTER.

02:37.949 --> 02:41.077
{\an5}- I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR LOSS.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.161
{\an5}- AND MAYBE YOU'D HUG HER
AND KISS HER.

02:46.207 --> 02:48.626
{\an5}- PLEASE CALL ME
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.924
{\an5}- SO YOU CAN DO
A LOT OF DIALECTS, YOU WROTE.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.344
{\an5}- YES, I PICK UP
PEOPLE'S LANGUAGES

02:58.428 --> 03:02.599
{\an5}WITHOUT EVEN TRYING.
I DON'T MEAN TO, I--[sniffs]

03:02.682 --> 03:03.808
{\an5}- IT SAYS "CANADIAN"
YOU CAN DO?

03:03.892 --> 03:06.102
- CANADIAN, UM...

03:06.185 --> 03:10.106
{\an5}CANADIAN
IS A LOT LIKE BRITISH.

03:10.189 --> 03:12.650
{\an5}- I'M CANADIAN.
- ARE YOU CANADIAN?

03:12.734 --> 03:14.110
{\an5}- YEAH.
- WELL, YOU SOUND NORMAL.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.947
{\an5}- A CHILD IS RUNNING
UP AND DOWN THE AISLES

03:18.031 --> 03:20.783
{\an5}DURING THE SERVICE.
HOW DO YOU HANDLE THIS?

03:20.867 --> 03:24.078
{\an5}- YOU ARE A LITTLE [bleep]!
JUST GO BACK TO YOUR SEAT,

03:24.162 --> 03:26.497
{\an5}OR I'M GONNA
TELL YOUR [bleep] PARENTS!

03:26.581 --> 03:28.333
- I AM SEAN CONNERY.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.502
I WANT A MASSAGE.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.714
{\an5}- I LIVE
UP IN THE DESERT.

03:34.797 --> 03:36.591
{\an5}- NOW THAT I HAD
SELECTED MY ACTORS,

03:36.674 --> 03:38.468
{\an5}I WANTED
TO DEMONSTRATE FOR CANDY

03:38.551 --> 03:41.054
{\an5}WHAT A FUNERAL SERVICE
WITH FAKE FAMILY AND FRIENDS

03:41.137 --> 03:42.639
MIGHT LOOK LIKE,

03:42.722 --> 03:44.182
{\an5}SO SPENT THE NIGHT
WRITING A SCRIPT

03:44.265 --> 03:46.142
{\an5}FOR THE FUNERAL
OF A FAKE DEAD GUY

03:46.225 --> 03:48.561
{\an5}AND SENT IT
TO ALL THE ACTORS.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.481
{\an5}THE NEXT DAY,
WE ARRIVED AT THE FUNERAL HOME

03:51.564 --> 03:53.691
{\an5}REHEARSED
AND IN WARDROBE,

03:53.775 --> 03:55.068
{\an5}AND WITH THE ACTORS
IN PLACE,

03:55.318 --> 03:57.028
{\an5}IT WAS TIME
TO BRING IN MRS. BOYD.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.613
{\an5}THE WOMAN
IN THE BLACK HAT

03:58.696 --> 04:00.114
{\an5}IS THE WIDOW.
- MM-HMM, THE WIDOW.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.450
{\an5}- AND SHE HIRED
SEVEN ACTORS

04:02.533 --> 04:06.079
{\an5}TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
THAT MAN WHO JUST DIED,

04:06.329 --> 04:10.166
{\an5}WHO'S GETTING IN THE CASKET,
WAS MORE LOVED THAN HE WAS.

04:10.249 --> 04:11.918
{\an5}- OKAY.
- OKAY,

04:12.001 --> 04:15.004
{\an5}AND I THINK
WE'RE READY TO BEGIN.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.507
{\an5}- WE ARE GATHERED HERE
TODAY

{\an5}AND IF THE ATTENDANCE TODAY
IS ANY INDICATION,

{\an5}WOULD ANYONE
LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS?

04:33.481 --> 04:37.819
- SID WAS SUCH A GOOD GUY.

04:37.902 --> 04:43.282
{\an5}HE ONCE GAVE ME $1,000
FOR NO REASON.

04:43.366 --> 04:48.621
{\an5}I'M SO SAD.
I AM SO SAD.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.207
I AM SO SAD.

04:51.290 --> 04:55.044
I AM SO...SAD.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.756

04:58.840 --> 05:01.050
{\an5}- I CAN'T HOLD IT IN
ANYMORE. [sobbing]

05:01.300 --> 05:03.052
ME AND SID WERE LOVERS.

05:03.302 --> 05:05.013
{\an5}WE'VE BEEN HAVING AN AFFAIR
FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.141
{\an5}[sobs]
- I KNEW IT!

05:08.224 --> 05:12.020

TO 7-ELEVEN, HE WAS WITH YOU!

05:12.103 --> 05:14.230
{\an5}- I'M SORRY.
- WE CANNOT BE MAD.

05:14.313 --> 05:16.149
SID WAS CURSED...

05:16.399 --> 05:19.861

OF HAVING TOO MUCH LOVE TO GIVE.

THAT CLAIMS TO HAVE

07:50.386 --> 07:53.598
{\an5}THE BEST BURGER IN LOS ANGELES
COMPLETELY EMPTY?

{\an5}GUSTAVO MUNOZ OWNS L.A. BURGER
IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA,

07:57.435 --> 07:59.312
{\an5}AND HE HAS
THE BEST BURGER IN TOWN.

07:59.395 --> 08:01.230
{\an8}- I HAVE THE BEST BURGERS
IN L.A.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.149
{\an5}- SO I PAID HIM A VISIT
WITH A WAY

08:03.232 --> 08:05.026
{\an5}TO GET EVERYONE

08:05.109 --> 08:08.112

IT'S THE BEST IN L.A.,

08:10.198 --> 08:12.909

$100 CASH OF HIS OWN MONEY.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.454

08:18.331 --> 08:21.209
{\an5}- OKAY, GREAT.
SO THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

08:21.292 --> 08:23.127
{\an5}- WELL,
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE--

08:23.211 --> 08:25.254

ISN'T THE BEST.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.218
{\an5}- WAIT,
IS YOUR BURGER THE BEST?

08:30.301 --> 08:32.220
{\an5}- OF COURSE,
IT'S THE BEST.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.847
{\an5}- 'CAUSE NO BURGER PLACE
HAS EVER MADE A CLAIM LIKE THIS,

08:34.931 --> 08:39.559
{\an5}BUT YOU CAN,
'CAUSE YOU'RE THE BEST.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.354
{\an5}- WELL,
IT SOUNDS GOOD.

{\an5}- YEAH

HIS OWN CASH FOR THE PROMOTION,

08:46.984 --> 08:48.277
{\an5}AND IT WAS
SUCH AN AMAZING OFFER,

08:48.361 --> 08:50.279
{\an5}THAT I WAS EASILY ABLE
TO LAND US

08:50.363 --> 08:52.907
{\an5}ON L.A.'S MOST LISTENED-TO
MORNING RADIO SHOW.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.117
{\an5}- [radio announcer]
95.5 KLOS.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.328
{\an5}- COME OVER,
TRY OUR--OUR BURGERS.

08:57.578 --> 09:00.790
{\an5}IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
IT'S GONNA BE $100 BILL.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.375
{\an5}- WOW, THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
- THAT'S--

09:02.458 --> 09:04.126
{\an5}THAT'S A LOT OF BALLS,
GUSTAVO...

09:04.210 --> 09:06.045
{\an5}- YEAH.
- 100 BUCKS, 'CAUSE I MEAN,

09:06.128 --> 09:07.672
{\an5}AREN'T YOU--I MEAN,
WHEN'S THIS PROMOTION HAPPENING?

09:07.755 --> 09:09.340
{\an5}- IT'S GONNA HAPPEN TODAY AT--
- TODAY?

09:09.423 --> 09:11.133
{\an5}- YEAH.
- I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR

09:11.217 --> 09:12.343
{\an5}HOW IT TURNS OUT. OKAY.
- ALL FAITH, ALL RIGHT.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.136
- AND I TRUST HIM,

09:14.220 --> 09:15.638
{\an5}BECAUSE I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY
TRIED THE BURGER.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.014
{\an5}I DON'T EAT RED MEAT
RIGHT NOW.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.724
{\an5}- WHAT?
- WHAT?

09:18.808 --> 09:20.268
{\an5}- SO I MEAN,
WHEN HE SAYS IT'S THE BEST,

09:20.559 --> 09:21.978
{\an5}I--YOU KNOW,
I BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE BEST.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.479
{\an5}- OKAY.
- CAN I ASK,

09:23.729 --> 09:25.314
{\an5}HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE LISTENING RIGHT NOW?

09:25.398 --> 09:26.732
{\an5}both: MILLIONS.
- MILLIONS?

09:26.816 --> 09:28.484
{\an5}- YEAH.
- MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

09:28.567 --> 09:30.152
{\an5}ARE LISTENING TO THIS RIGHT NOW,
GUSTAVO.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.696
{\an5}- THAT'S CRAZY.
- YEAH, THAT IS.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.781
{\an5}- LET'S GO TO FREDDY
ON LINE TWO.

09:33.864 --> 09:36.409
{\an5}HELLO, FREDDY. WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS PROMOTIONAL IDEA

09:36.492 --> 09:37.952
{\an5}THAT L.A. BURGER'S
THROWING ON.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.162
{\an5}- I THINK
IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.290
{\an5}LET ME TELL YOU MY BACKGROUND,
FIRST OF ALL--

09:42.373 --> 09:44.417
{\an5}- WELL, I--WHO CARES
ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND, FREDDY?

09:44.667 --> 09:47.503
{\an5}[laughter]
ALL RIGHT, NEXT CALLER, PLEASE.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.463
{\an5}- STEVE ON LINE TWO.
HELLO, STEVE.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.507
{\an5}WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS IDEA?

09:51.591 --> 09:55.261
{\an5}- WELL, I ADMIRE, YOU KNOW,
HIM STANDING BY HIS PRODUCT,

09:55.344 --> 09:58.306
{\an5}BUT I THINK
THAT SOMEBODY CAN BE DISHONEST

09:58.389 --> 10:02.018
{\an5}AND LIE ABOUT THE BURGER.
THEY CAN JUST SAY, "YOU KNOW,

10:02.101 --> 10:04.145
{\an5}I'VE HAD OTHER BURGERS
I THINK ARE BETTER."

10:04.228 --> 10:05.980
{\an5}- I COULD SEE THAT GUSTAVO
WAS GETTING NERVOUS

10:06.063 --> 10:07.315
DURING THE RADIO SHOW,

10:07.398 --> 10:09.442
{\an5}SO AFTER,
I HAD A TALK WITH HIM.

10:09.525 --> 10:12.278
{\an5}- SO I SAW YOU WERE
A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS IN THERE.

10:12.361 --> 10:15.781
{\an5}- UM, A LITTLE.
[chuckles]

10:15.865 --> 10:18.826
{\an5}- WELL, I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE
A STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE FOR YOU,

10:18.909 --> 10:21.829
{\an5}SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
EVEN THOUGH IT'S UNLIKELY

10:21.912 --> 10:25.124
{\an5}I THINK PEOPLE
WILL CLAIM THE $100,

10:25.207 --> 10:28.336
{\an5}I'LL PERSONALLY PUT UP
MY OWN MONEY IF THEY DO,

10:28.419 --> 10:30.463
{\an5}BUT IT'S ONLY BECAUSE
I TRUST YOU

10:30.546 --> 10:33.341
{\an5}WHEN YOU SAY IT'S THE BEST.
IT IS THE BEST, RIGHT?

10:33.424 --> 10:34.842
- IT IS THE BEST, YES.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.552
{\an5}- SO WE WON'T
BE PAYING A LOT.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.305
{\an5}- WE'RE NOT GONNA PAY
THAT MUCH MONEY...AT ALL.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.974
{\an5}- OKAY, SO NO RISK ON YOU,
IT'S ALL ON ME.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.726
both: [laugh]

10:43.809 --> 10:47.313
{\an5}- NOW I'M A BIT NERVOUS.
[both chuckle]

10:47.396 --> 10:49.190
{\an5}THE RADIO SHOW APPEARANCE
SEEMED TO WORK,

10:49.273 --> 10:50.775
{\an5}BECAUSE WHEN WE GOT
BACK TO L.A. BURGER,

10:50.858 --> 10:52.777
{\an5}THERE WAS A LINE
AROUND THE BLOCK.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.071
{\an5}HUH?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:55.154 --> 10:57.031
{\an5}IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
- YEAH, IT'S VERY GOOD, YEAH.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.908
{\an5}- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO COOK SOME BURGERS.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.077
{\an5}- OKAY.
- AND WITH GUSTAVO ON THE GRILL,

11:01.160 --> 11:02.912
I GOT THE CROWD PUMPED

11:02.995 --> 11:04.997
{\an5}FOR THE BEST BURGER EXPERIENCE
THEY'VE EVER HAD.

11:05.081 --> 11:08.501
{\an5}ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
WELCOME TO L.A. BURGER.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.086
{\an5}THE PROMOTION
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

11:12.588 --> 11:16.634
[cheers and applause]

11:16.717 --> 11:18.636
{\an5}AND AFTER A COUPLE PEOPLE
BOUGHT BURGERS,

11:18.719 --> 11:20.513
{\an5}IT SEEMED LIKE GUSTAVO
WAS RIGHT.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.432
{\an5}- UH, I LISTENED TO KLOS THIS
MORNING TO HEIDI AND FRANK,

11:23.516 --> 11:26.018
{\an5}BUT IT'S A GOOD BURGER, YEAH.
IT'S EXCELLENT. I LIKE IT.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.561
{\an5}- CAME IN HERE
AND HAD ONE,

11:27.812 --> 11:29.480
{\an5}BEST BURGER IN L.A.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.565
{\an5}- I WAS HAPPY TO SEE
SOME PEOPLE WERE BEING HONEST

11:31.649 --> 11:33.442
{\an5}ABOUT LIKING THE BURGER,
BUT I SUSPECTED

11:33.526 --> 11:35.361
{\an5}OTHERS WERE LYING
JUST TO GET THE MONEY.

11:35.444 --> 11:38.072
{\an5}- I MEAN, I'M NOT A FAN
OF MUSTARD AND KETCHUP.

11:38.155 --> 11:40.449
{\an5}I THINK THEY SHOULD LEAVE THAT
TO MCDONALD'S, YOU KNOW?

11:40.533 --> 11:42.451
{\an5}- IT'S LEAVING
THAT AFTERTASTE IN MY MOUTH.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.537
{\an5}I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU.
I'M GONNA GO HOME,

11:44.620 --> 11:46.414
{\an5}AND I'M GONNA BRUSH MY TEETH
TO TRY TO GET IT OUT,

11:46.497 --> 11:47.957
{\an5}BECAUSE
IT'S NOT GOOD AT ALL.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.542
{\an5}- WELL,
THE BEST WAY TO TELL

11:49.625 --> 11:51.585
{\an5}IF SOMEONE
DOESN'T LIKE SOMETHING

11:51.669 --> 11:52.253
{\an5}IS BY LOOKING AT THEIR FACE
WHEN THEY TAKE A BITE.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.843
{\an5}- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT HAMBURGER, MAN.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.178
THAT IS GOOD.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.473
{\an5}- WOW, DO YOU WANT $100
OR AN ACADEMY AWARD?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.434
- $100.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.519
{\an5}- I THOUGHT SOME PEOPLE
MIGHT BE DISHONEST,

12:08.602 --> 12:11.021
{\an5}SO I BROUGHT HOLY BOOKS
FROM EVERY MAJOR RELIGION

12:11.105 --> 12:13.232
{\an5}TO BE SURE PEOPLE WERE
TELLING THE TRUTH.

12:13.315 --> 12:16.318
{\an5}- I DO NOT THINK THIS IS
THE BEST BURGER IN L.A.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.447
{\an5}- I DID NOT LIKE THE BURGER,
I SOLEMNLY SWEAR.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.365
{\an5}- NO, I DON'T LIKE THE BURGER.
- OKAY.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.951
{\an5}- WHOO, ANYBODY GOT
SOME TOOTHPASTE, OR SOMETHING?

12:24.034 --> 12:26.078
{\an5}SHOOT.
- BUT STILL,

12:26.162 --> 12:28.414
{\an5}IT DIDN'T SEEM TO HELP,
AND BY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON,

12:28.497 --> 12:34.378
{\an5}I WAS PAYING OUT TONS AND TONS
AND TONS OF MY OWN MONEY.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.338
{\an5}I JUST COULDN'T TELL
WHO WAS LYING,

12:36.422 --> 12:38.466
{\an5}AND WHEN I TRIED TO QUESTION
PEOPLE, THEY GOT UNRULY.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.050
{\an5}- DUDE, I'LL CALL A LAWYER
RIGHT NOW

12:40.134 --> 12:41.594
{\an5}IF YOU'RE SAYING
I'M [bleep] LYING.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.262
{\an5}- YEAH,
BUT WHY ARE YOU SO MAD?

12:43.345 --> 12:45.139
{\an5}- 'CAUSE YOU'RE SAYING
I'M LYING.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.182
{\an5}IT'S NOT THE GREATEST
DAMN BURGER IN THE WORLD,

12:46.265 --> 12:48.058
OR IN L.A.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.935
{\an5}- THE ONLY WAY TO CALM THE MOB
WAS TO PAY THEM OUT.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.812
{\an5}I'M A FRUGAL GUY,
SO THIS WAS REALLY HARD FOR ME.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.522
{\an5}- THIS IS MY SECOND BURGER.
IT'S GOOD, LIKE--

12:53.606 --> 12:55.483
{\an5}- YOUR SECOND BURGER?
- WHOA HO HO HO!

12:55.566 --> 12:57.067
{\an5}- THE SECOND?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:57.151 --> 12:58.611
{\an5}- WAIT, TIME OUT.
- SECOND BURGER?

12:58.694 --> 13:00.362
{\an5}- SECOND BURGER.
- IT'S GOOD.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.239
{\an5}- AND BY THE END
OF THE AFTERNOON,

13:02.323 --> 13:04.241
{\an5}I WAS DOING WHATEVER I COULD
TO HOLD ONTO MY MONEY.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.743
{\an5}- THE BURGERS, WELL, DID NOT
REALLY SATISFY MY TASTES,

13:05.826 --> 13:07.620
{\an5}AND I HADN'T EVEN
HAD BREAKFAST.

13:07.870 --> 13:11.874
{\an5}- IT'S GETTING TO THE POINT
WHERE IF WE GIVE YOU THE $100,

13:11.957 --> 13:14.793
{\an5}WE MIGHT HAVE TO START
CUTTING STAFF,

13:14.877 --> 13:17.546
{\an5}AND RAQUEL WOULD BE
THE FIRST TO GO.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.548
- WHO'S RAQUEL?

13:19.632 --> 13:20.841
{\an5}- SHE WORKS
IN THE KITCHEN.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.635
{\an5}- OH, NO.
- SO YEAH,

13:22.718 --> 13:25.554
{\an5}HERE'S YOUR $100 EACH.
HERE YOU GO.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.431
{\an5}- IT WAS REALLY BAD.
- YEAH.

13:27.515 --> 13:31.602
{\an5}- OH, HEY, RAQUEL.
WERE YOU JUST WALKING OUT HERE?

13:31.685 --> 13:34.522
{\an5}- YEAH.
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

13:34.605 --> 13:36.690
{\an5}- GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?
- UH, RAQUEL,

13:36.774 --> 13:39.235
{\an5}THE PROMOTION IS COSTING US
MORE THAN WE THOUGHT IT WOULD,

13:39.318 --> 13:41.445
{\an5}SO WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO LET YOU GO.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.489
- IT'S NOT FAIR.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.658
{\an5}- IT'S FINE.
HAVE YOUR MONEY. HERE.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.576
{\an5}- NO, IT'S OKAY. REALLY,
- SHE'S WAITING AROUND. I MEAN--

13:47.826 --> 13:49.578
{\an5}- I MEAN, NO THE TRUTH IS--
THE TRUTH IS, I MEAN,

13:49.828 --> 13:51.539
{\an5}IF IT'S GONNA GET LIKE THIS,
IT'S NOT REALLY WORTH IT.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.082
{\an5}- DO YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE IT BACK?

13:53.165 --> 13:54.750
{\an5}YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.669
{\an5}- YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO WITH IT?

13:56.752 --> 13:58.295
{\an5}- WE'RE GONNA KEEP YOU AROUND.
- [laughs] THANKS.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.838
{\an5}- THANKS.
THANK--THANK THEM.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.674
{\an5}THAT WAS NICE OF YOU GUYS.
- YEAH.

14:01.757 --> 14:02.591
{\an5}THANKS SO MUCH.
YOU GUYS ARE GENEROUS.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.717
- NO PROBLEM.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.261
- BY THE END OF THE DAY,

14:05.344 --> 14:06.679
THE CUSTOMERS LEFT HAPPY,

14:06.929 --> 14:08.597
{\an5}AND GUSTAVO SOLD
A LOT OF BURGERS.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.723
{\an5}IT SEEMED LIKE EVERYONE
CAME OUT A WINNER,

14:09.807 --> 14:10.683
EXCEPT FOR ME.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.101
HOW WAS IT TODAY?

14:12.184 --> 14:13.727
- GOOD. IT WAS GOOD.

14:13.811 --> 14:14.728
{\an5}- THAT WAS BRUTAL
FOR ME.

14:14.812 --> 14:15.813
- REALLY?

14:15.896 --> 14:17.690
- I LOST $6,000.

14:17.773 --> 14:20.109
- $6,000?

14:20.192 --> 14:23.487
{\an5}- YEAH, OF MY OWN MONEY,
FROM PAYING PEOPLE.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.281
[sighs]

14:25.364 --> 14:27.199
{\an5}IT MAY HAVE BEEN A LOT OF MONEY,
BUT THEN AGAIN,

14:27.283 --> 14:30.536
{\an5}IT WAS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY
TO SEE GUSTAVO SMILE.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.705
{\an5}COMING UP, THOUGH,
I RISK LOSING SOMETHING

14:32.788 --> 14:35.666
{\an5}EVEN MORE PRECIOUS THAN MONEY--
MY LIFE.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.006
{\an5}- SOMETIMES,
IF WE'RE HELPING A BUSINESS,

14:42.089 --> 14:44.800
{\an5}IT'S IMPORTANT TO EXPERIENCE
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A CUSTOMER,

14:44.883 --> 14:46.677
AND ONCE IN A WHILE,

14:46.760 --> 14:50.598
{\an5}THAT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
IS PRETTY RAD.

14:50.681 --> 14:54.560
{\an5}SCOTT SMITH RUNS SKYDIVE PERRIS
IN PERRIS, CALIFORNIA,

14:54.643 --> 14:56.186
{\an5}AND THOUGH
HE LOVES TO FALL, ONE THING

14:56.270 --> 14:58.647
{\an5}HE DOESN'T WANT TO FALL
IS HIS PROFITS.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.025
{\an8}- IT'D BE NICER TO HAVE
A LITTLE BIT MORE CONSISTENCY

15:01.108 --> 15:03.736
{\an8}IN TERMS OF THE BUSINESS LEVEL
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.821
{\an5}- SKYDIVING IS SO SWEET,
AND I WAS STOKED

15:05.904 --> 15:10.034
{\an5}TO PAY HIM A VISIT
TO HELP HIS BUSINESS OUT.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.703
{\an5}HEY.
- HI. YOU MUST BE NATHAN.

15:12.786 --> 15:13.787
{\an5}- YEAH.
- SCOTT SMITH. NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.706
- GOOD TO MEET YOU, MAN.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.416
{\an5}SKYDIVING, I MEAN...
- MM-HMM.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.001
{\an5}- THAT'S A COOL BUSINESS.
LIKE, REALLY,

15:19.084 --> 15:20.794
{\an5}THAT'S SWEET,
SO TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.297
{\an5}- WELL, SKYDIVING,
IT'S OUR BUSINESS HERE,

15:23.380 --> 15:25.007
BUT IT'S ALSO OUR PASSION.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.301
{\an5}- I MEAN, I'D LOVE TO DO,
LIKE, A JUMP,

15:27.384 --> 15:29.637
{\an5}TO GET A BETTER SENSE
OF THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE,

15:29.720 --> 15:31.680
{\an5}BUT MOSTLY JUST TO,
YOU KNOW, LIKE,

15:31.764 --> 15:33.390
{\an5}ROCK AND ROLL AND STUFF.
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.100
{\an5}- YEAH, JUST, LIKE,
GET OUT THERE.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.852
{\an5}- EXCELLENT. WELL,
WE GOT SOME PAPERWORK

15:37.102 --> 15:38.812
{\an5}YOU GOTTA FILL OUT FIRST.
- ALL RIGHT, SWEET, MAN.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.773
{\an5}- LET'S DO IT, MAN.
- I WAS PUMPED

15:40.856 --> 15:42.441
{\an5}FOR MY FIRST SKYDIVE,
AND THIS WOULD REALLY GIVE ME

15:42.524 --> 15:43.942
{\an5}A GOOD SENSE
OF THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

15:44.026 --> 15:45.653
{\an5}AT SKYDIVE PERRIS,
BUT MOSTLY,

15:45.944 --> 15:49.865
{\an5}I JUST WANTED TO GET
ON OUT THERE AND EAT SOME WIND.

15:49.948 --> 15:51.867
{\an5}SO HOW HIGH ARE WE GOING,
LIKE 500 FEET?

15:51.950 --> 15:54.745
{\an5}- UH, NO, WE'RE GOING
TO 12,500 FEET.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.580
