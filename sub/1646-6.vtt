00:01.001 --> 00:02.419
Previously on Prison Break:

00:02.502 --> 00:04.254
Someone at Homeland
Security did an enhanced

00:04.337 --> 00:05.588
image search
on you today.

00:05.672 --> 00:06.589
Who?

00:06.673 --> 00:07.590
His name is Don Self.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.316
Yes.

00:27.318 --> 00:28.361
What do you say
you give me that little

00:28.445 --> 00:30.030
piece of paper
in your hand?

00:30.905 --> 00:32.032
From now on, I'm asking

00:32.115 --> 00:34.075
that everyone keep
their card on them

00:34.159 --> 00:35.869
at all times.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.246
Where's the
bird book?

00:38.329 --> 00:39.414
Bird book?

00:39.497 --> 00:40.707
Where's the book?!

00:40.790 --> 00:41.958
Someone was following me.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.209
Is this the guy?

00:43.293 --> 00:44.169
Yeah.

00:44.961 --> 00:46.004
Who's that?

00:46.087 --> 00:47.881
That's the man
who killed my son.

00:47.964 --> 00:49.466
Now he's come to kill us.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.150
Don't get used
to it.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.697
SparkleKid,
Gate 8.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.373
Excuse me.

01:22.457 --> 01:23.500
Hi, there.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.043
I would like to place
some bets, please.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.256
Uh, I'd like to place an exacta

01:30.340 --> 01:33.510
on Captain Brody and Mister
Hooper in the first race.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.220
All right.

01:35.303 --> 01:36.638
Twenty dollars, please.

01:36.888 --> 01:37.889
Thank you.

01:37.972 --> 01:38.932
I think you made
a mistake here.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.308
I wanted a quinella

01:40.391 --> 01:43.144
for Captain Brody and Mister
Hooper in the first race.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.771
Uh, you gave me an exacta.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.356
That's what you told
me you wanted.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.774
No, it's not
what I told you.

01:47.857 --> 01:49.109
And I want you
to fix it!

01:49.192 --> 01:50.693
Sir, I gave you exactly
what you asked...

01:50.777 --> 01:52.529
No, you didn't-- What the hell
kind of place is this?!

01:52.612 --> 01:54.405
-If you'll just calm down, please.
-I'm not--

01:54.489 --> 01:56.699
Calm down? What-what are
you talking about?

01:56.783 --> 01:57.909
I want you to fix this.

01:57.992 --> 01:58.827
you gave me

01:58.910 --> 02:00.912
the wrong bet.
I placed a bet

02:00.995 --> 02:02.455
on a quinella
on Doctor Brody

02:02.539 --> 02:04.124
and Mister Hooper
in the first race.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.375
Yo, somebody's
freaking out

02:05.458 --> 02:07.710
-on one of the clerks inside.
-We'll check it out.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.889
Hey, Louis,
we've got a disturbance by the windows.

02:25.436 --> 02:26.813
I'm on my way.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.401
What the hell kind of place
is this anyway?!

02:31.484 --> 02:33.528
-If you'll just calm down, please.
-I'm not...

02:33.611 --> 02:35.155
What, what are you
talking about?

02:35.238 --> 02:36.156
I want you to fix this!

02:36.239 --> 02:37.949
This is-- You gave
me the wrong bet.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.701
For the first race
not an exacta.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.286
You gave me an exacta.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.705
You're holding up the line.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.248
Please, if you
don't mind...

02:45.331 --> 02:47.125
I'm not leaving this place
until I talk to the guy...

02:47.208 --> 02:49.127
Sir, if you could just
not get hysterical.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.587
I'm not getting
hysterical!

02:50.670 --> 02:52.213
-Hey, you need to calm down.
-Who the hell are you?

02:52.297 --> 02:53.590
I'm the operations manager,
all right. Take it easy.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.717
Do you run background checks
on your employees

02:55.800 --> 02:57.010
or do you just
let cons work here?

02:57.093 --> 02:58.344
Okay, there are no cons
working here, all right?

02:58.428 --> 02:59.637
Look at her.
What is she doing?

02:59.721 --> 03:01.890
Mayve, Mayve, do you
have a record, Mayve?

03:01.973 --> 03:03.057
Excuse me.
Sir, hey!

03:03.141 --> 03:04.434
That's enough.
Calm down, sir.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.145
I got a problem here.
Did you come to help me

03:07.228 --> 03:09.230
or did you come to give
me a hard time?

03:10.398 --> 03:11.524
Excuse me, Miss

03:12.901 --> 03:14.194
Oh.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.196
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.

03:16.279 --> 03:17.363
I would have been
in so much trouble

03:17.447 --> 03:19.032
if I'd lost those.
You don't know my boss.

03:19.115 --> 03:20.825
He would have gone up
one side of me and down the other.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.619
Thank you.
Any time.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.345
Look at her-- Why is she lookin' at me like
that? Why are you looking at me like that?

03:40.428 --> 03:41.888
Let's not yell at
anyone, all right?

03:41.971 --> 03:43.097
We'll take care of it.

03:43.181 --> 03:44.641
I'm not yelling
at anyone.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.101
Oh, sorry, sir.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.069
I'll keep an eye
on the monitors.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.159
He's heading back.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.163
Let's go.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.667
- How's it look?
- I'm getting a clear signal.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.168
We're all set.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.546
Cardholder number four,
you're up.

04:22.845 --> 04:23.930
Here you go, darling.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.057
Yeah. Thanks.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.268
The clocker said
SparkleKid was edging

04:28.351 --> 04:29.727
on the track record
at prep.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.229
Oh, that's great,
honey.

04:33.022 --> 04:34.399
Let's go.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.467
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen

05:01.551 --> 05:06.556
and welcome to the first race of the day
here at Los Alamitos.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.271
The starters are at the gate...

05:14.856 --> 05:16.482
and we're ready to go.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.863
And they're off and running.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.281
What the hell?

05:23.364 --> 05:26.284
It's stuck, it's stuck.
The gate's stuck!

05:28.161 --> 05:29.746
I'm gonna talk to the manager.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.662
I need to see the manager.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.039
Yes, sir.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.167
No, it's...

06:16.250 --> 06:18.127
You better have a damn
good explanation

06:18.211 --> 06:19.379
about what just
happened.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.589
All right,
I'll get back to you.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.049
We're looking into it
right now, Mr. Edison.

06:23.132 --> 06:24.967
Cue up the tape. Now.

06:34.811 --> 06:35.853
We've made contact.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.147
15% and counting.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.779
Right there, it stuck.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.075
What happened to his gate?!

06:49.158 --> 06:50.410
I-I don't know.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.078
Lewis you better
come down here.

06:52.161 --> 06:54.038
-Not now.
-We found something on Gate 8

06:54.122 --> 06:55.665
where SparkleKid was placed.

06:59.961 --> 07:00.837
I'll be right back.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.338
I'm coming with you.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.351
Did we get it?

07:16.060 --> 07:17.770
100%. We're all there.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.355
Card's all there.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.111
You've never jerked
a loser before.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.696
It's all your fault!

07:28.906 --> 07:30.241
We're gonna need
some backup.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.201
-Here come the cops.
-You better go before you get recognized.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.369
Someone has to be
lookout.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.954
I'll take care of it.
Go! Go!

07:35.872 --> 07:37.623
All right, break it up, guys.

07:37.707 --> 07:38.749
Let's go!

07:40.877 --> 07:42.295
That's enough.

07:42.378 --> 07:43.504
Let's go.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.298
Hi, there.

07:45.381 --> 07:46.299
Um, excuse me.

07:46.382 --> 07:47.633
I was wondering if
you could help me.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.677
I placed a bet on SparkleKid
for my boss.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.803
Do you know what
happened?

07:50.887 --> 07:52.221
Not right now,
sweetheart.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.266
Okay. My boss had me

07:55.349 --> 07:57.643
put more money on him
than I make in a week.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.313
Um, he's gonna flip out when
I tell him about this.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.482
I'm really not the right
person to ask.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.950
Okay, but, here, I put $500 here for
Orca's Revenge.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.994
Maybe I could... You're gonna have to talk
to one of the window clerks.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.288
But maybe I could
add it to that?

08:17.371 --> 08:19.415
Look, I-I can't help you,
all right?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.958
Now, move it along, honey.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.211
Okay, um, listen.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.587
I'm just trying
to ask you

08:24.670 --> 08:25.630
a couple questions.

08:25.713 --> 08:28.257
Yeah, well,
you asked one too many.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.177
How about this?

08:31.260 --> 08:32.428
Why don't you help me
find somebody

08:32.512 --> 08:34.096
who could help me
sort all this out?

08:34.180 --> 08:36.307
How's that? If you don't take
your hands off me

08:36.390 --> 08:37.850
you're gonna have a lot
more to worry about

08:37.934 --> 08:39.477
than an angry boss.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.103
All right, well, um...

08:42.980 --> 08:45.650
You take good care of
yourself today, Officer.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.616
Excuse me?

08:53.699 --> 08:54.784
This is a restricted
area, sir.

08:54.867 --> 08:55.868
You can't be back here.

08:55.952 --> 08:56.869
Yeah, I'm looking
for a manager

08:56.953 --> 08:58.204
because I'm getting
the money back

08:58.287 --> 09:00.039
that I bet on the horse
that got stuck in the gate.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.165
Did you see that one?
Yeah.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.333
I said you can't
be back here!

09:02.416 --> 09:03.543
I need back up.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.669
What are you doing?

09:06.712 --> 09:07.672
Hey!

09:18.474 --> 09:19.642
Where's Mahone?

09:19.725 --> 09:21.269
He's right there.

09:23.854 --> 09:24.855
That's great.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.315
He's got the device.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.611
We're screwed.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.212
Mommy?

09:49.463 --> 09:51.757
Go back to your room,
okay, sweetheart.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.301
Okay.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.601
Oh, my God.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.395
What happened to you?

10:05.354 --> 10:06.522
Hey, sis.

10:23.664 --> 10:24.790
We have an issue.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.751
Good afternoon to you, too,
Andy.

10:26.834 --> 10:27.877
I've been reviewing
your roster

10:27.960 --> 10:29.128
from the Northeast division,

10:29.211 --> 10:30.838
and apparently two
of your top buyers

10:30.921 --> 10:32.632
don't have valid
Social Security numbers.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.553
Care to explain that?

10:45.895 --> 10:48.397
When I'm about to make a sale
to a client,

10:48.481 --> 10:50.066
I ask myself two questions:

10:50.149 --> 10:53.819
"Is the client being helped?"

10:53.903 --> 10:55.446
and, "Are we gettin' paid?"

10:57.740 --> 10:59.659
There's a reason

10:59.742 --> 11:02.620
why I was the top seller
in the Northeast.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.914
I don't get hung up
on the details.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.000
And what you're saying is...?

11:08.084 --> 11:11.003
There might be a typo
or two in my reports,

11:11.087 --> 11:13.589
but I'm pretty sure
those checks cleared.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.257
Uh-huh.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.052
Fair enough.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.047
You've had
a busy morning, Frank.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.800
Unlawful entry,
resisting arrest.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.385
It's not even
lunchtime.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.891
You're trying to put
the fear of God into me.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.102
Mission accomplished.

12:09.812 --> 12:10.896
Listen, Sergeant,

12:10.980 --> 12:12.898
I know a decent amount
about the justice system,

12:12.982 --> 12:14.984
enough to know that
if you wanted to,

12:15.067 --> 12:17.528
you could drop this
whole thing and...

12:17.611 --> 12:20.322
it would save a lot of
trouble for everybody, huh?

12:21.949 --> 12:23.033
What kind of phone is this?

12:23.117 --> 12:25.411
It's a, a Japanese brand.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.121
Off market.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.998
What about the ankle monitor
you're wearing?

12:32.293 --> 12:33.919
I've been on the
straight and narrow,

12:34.003 --> 12:35.463
and it's due to come
off in a couple of days.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.966
Press your fingers in the ink.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.764
I had two grand go up in smoke
because of a bum gate.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.140
I mean, I got a little upset
for a second.

12:46.223 --> 12:47.600
You know what I mean?
Who wouldn't?

12:48.851 --> 12:50.603
Let's talk about this.

12:50.686 --> 12:53.189
Should we talk about how
you punched an officer first?

12:53.272 --> 12:54.940
Or how you tried
to flee the scene?

12:55.483 --> 12:56.442
Pick a felony.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.530
Take him to the holding cell.

13:08.370 --> 13:09.955
What do you mean he got arrested?

13:10.039 --> 13:10.956
W-What happened?

13:11.040 --> 13:12.166
It's a long story,

13:12.249 --> 13:14.210
but we need you to get
Mahone and the device out.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.252
Can you do that?

13:15.336 --> 13:16.378
What, what do you think,

13:16.462 --> 13:17.630
that every time
you guys screw up,

13:17.713 --> 13:19.215
I can just magically
make things disappear?

13:19.298 --> 13:21.300
We ain't interested
in your excuses.

13:21.383 --> 13:22.426
Can you do it or not?

13:22.510 --> 13:24.637
Lincoln, y-you know what?
I'll call you back.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.096
Excuse me.
Who are you?

13:26.180 --> 13:27.932
What is this?
I'm Brian.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.100
I work
in the IT department.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.478
We were getting
some registry inconsistencies

13:32.561 --> 13:33.646
on the server,
so...

13:33.729 --> 13:35.856
I'm just running
a few routine spot checks.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.983
So you just barge in
here without asking?

13:38.067 --> 13:40.152
I have level two clearance. See?

13:41.028 --> 13:42.238
It's what I do.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.198
I go into people's offices,
I fix their computers.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.324
I just figured
it was better

13:45.407 --> 13:46.408
to do it
when you weren't here.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.576
Well, you know what?
You got to go.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.869
Don't come
back in here.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.831
Sure thing.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.207
You're all set.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.507
So what's the word?

14:01.590 --> 14:02.967
Self's on it.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.638
"On it," as in
he's getting Mahone out?

14:07.721 --> 14:09.348
He said he'd handle it.

14:09.431 --> 14:10.474
What's there to handle?

14:10.558 --> 14:13.143
Self yanked us all out of prison
for way bigger charges.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.104
Getting Mahone out should
be easy, shouldn't it?

14:15.187 --> 14:16.146
Yeah.

14:25.614 --> 14:28.200
Let's concentrate
on finding the next cardholder.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.495
As soon as we get the device
back, we'll move forward.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.747
Would you please walk us through
what we know so far?

14:33.831 --> 14:35.499
Sure.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.126
Howard Scuderi
runs AgriSow,

14:37.209 --> 14:39.712
which is the world's largest
agricultural conglomerate.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.672
It actually has huge
holdings in Laos,

14:41.755 --> 14:42.923
which, given the
current inflation,

14:43.007 --> 14:45.217
means that they are making
money hand over fist.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.952
"My friends are playing
at the park."

15:13.954 --> 15:15.372
Sweetheart, why don't
you go play in your room

15:15.456 --> 15:16.957
for a little
bit, okay?

15:22.546 --> 15:24.006
How are you feeling?

15:24.840 --> 15:26.467
Better.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.136
I, I made you
a sandwich.

15:29.553 --> 15:30.596
Thank you.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.850
Um, you never explained
what happened.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.980
Well, um...

15:40.064 --> 15:42.858
my car broke down in the middle
of the desert, and, uh...

15:42.942 --> 15:43.943
there was no one around
for miles,

15:44.026 --> 15:45.736
and my cell phone
was dead,

15:45.819 --> 15:47.029
so I walked here.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.075
Hey, do you still
have that owl

15:51.158 --> 15:52.409
that I sent from Germany?

15:52.493 --> 15:53.577
Yeah.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.120
I need to see it.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.246
Okay.

16:06.423 --> 16:07.549
Thank you.

16:10.594 --> 16:11.971
Oh, my God, Gretchen.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.098
Is that, is that,
that a real gun?

16:14.181 --> 16:15.140
It is.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.768
You don't work
for the IRS?

16:17.851 --> 16:18.936
I don't.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.690
Who do you work for?

16:22.773 --> 16:24.358
As of now?

16:25.234 --> 16:26.276
Myself.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.451
He attended Touro Law
School in Long Island.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.331
He spent the next
eighteen years

16:39.415 --> 16:43.043
bouncing around the D.O.J.
and D.O.D. before being dumped

16:43.127 --> 16:44.878
on the doorstep
of Homeland in '02.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.047
Come in.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.428
General.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.264
What did you find out?

16:55.347 --> 16:58.100
I tried accessing
Self's user account,

16:58.183 --> 17:01.520
but he has a tricky
firewall system in place.

17:01.603 --> 17:03.063
There's no easy
way to get past it,

17:03.147 --> 17:04.356
not without...

17:04.440 --> 17:05.816
drawing attention.

17:05.899 --> 17:09.319
So we still don't know
why he's interested in me.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.448
Maybe if you
gave me more time...

17:14.700 --> 17:15.951
I'll look into it.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.838
Look, he's important to me.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.631
Okay, he's doing
a job for me.

17:29.715 --> 17:30.716
Yeah, well,
your CI punched

17:30.799 --> 17:31.800
one of my officers
in the face.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.093
I understand...

17:33.177 --> 17:34.553
You're lucky he's not
being charged with worse.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.221
I apologize
for him.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.765
Okay?

17:37.848 --> 17:40.017
Look, I-I'm asking
for a favor here,

17:40.100 --> 17:42.394
okay, from one badge to another.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.730
When was the last time
you looked at your badge?

17:44.813 --> 17:45.731
'Cause I'm pretty sure
mine says

17:45.814 --> 17:47.483
"issued by the City
of Los Angeles,"

17:47.566 --> 17:48.567
not the federal government,

17:48.650 --> 17:50.402
-so unless you get a court order that...
-Hey, hey!

17:50.486 --> 17:52.404
You want to go that route?
You want to get smart?

17:52.488 --> 17:55.157
Huh? Want to get detained
at the Guadalajara airport

17:55.240 --> 17:56.950
when you're coming back
from visiting your Nana?

17:57.034 --> 17:58.160
How does that sound?

17:58.243 --> 18:00.162
Huh? You ever hear
of a no-fly list?

18:00.245 --> 18:01.538
That's what my
badge could do.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.749
Okay?

18:03.832 --> 18:05.834
Want to see what
else it could do?

18:12.007 --> 18:13.258
I was starting to worry.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.177
Sign these.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.346
Yeah.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.060
These aren't release papers.
I need you to sign that

18:23.143 --> 18:24.436
so I can collect
your personal...

18:24.520 --> 18:26.146
They're gonna run my prints,
and once they...

18:26.230 --> 18:27.106
You punched a cop.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.524
Yeah, trying to save
the mission.

18:28.607 --> 18:29.942
Keep your voice down, okay?

18:30.025 --> 18:31.443
I did the best I could do.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.238
You need to sign those so
I can collect Roland's device.

18:37.282 --> 18:40.160
You... you want me
to give up the one thing

18:40.244 --> 18:41.954
that makes me valuable
to the team.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.997
Yeah, you knew the deal
when you came on board.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.583
Okay, we all sacrificed a lot
to get this far.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.709
You want to flush it
down the toilet

18:47.793 --> 18:49.419
because you made a bad move?

19:19.366 --> 19:20.534
Got it.

19:20.617 --> 19:21.994
Self got the device.

19:22.077 --> 19:23.412
Mahone's still in jail.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.332
But Mahone--
he-he's part of the team.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.333
Was.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.793
Look, I feel
just as bad

19:29.877 --> 19:31.336
about his kid as everyone else,

19:31.420 --> 19:33.422
but we can't blow this mission
on one person.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.674
Oh, yeah?
So if I get popped tomorrow,

19:35.757 --> 19:37.176
you guys are just going
to forget about me?

19:37.259 --> 19:38.135
Yeah.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.929
Hey, listen.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.015
An assassin is trying
to hunt us down, okay?

19:43.098 --> 19:45.642
And that T-Bag character
is out in the wind

19:45.726 --> 19:46.768
with the keys
to the castle.

19:46.852 --> 19:47.936
We got enough problems

19:48.020 --> 19:50.355
without having to worry
about this guy's ass in jail.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.065
You shut up.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.902
Okay. Alex has an alias,
but if they run his prints,

19:54.985 --> 19:56.028
-they're gonna find out that he's...
-Not if--

19:56.111 --> 19:57.571
when they run his prints,
they're going

19:57.654 --> 19:59.031
to figure out who he is

19:59.114 --> 20:00.991
and that he's not in a supermax
like he's supposed to be,

20:01.074 --> 20:02.659
and then they're gonna realize
we're not in a supermax...

20:02.743 --> 20:03.952
Michael.

20:07.497 --> 20:08.457
Linc's right.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.583
We don't have a choice.

20:09.666 --> 20:10.626
We move forward
with the plan.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.316
Agent Self.

20:44.993 --> 20:48.163
I'm an associate
of General Krantz.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.000
Word has gotten back
to the General

20:52.084 --> 20:55.545
that you've been pulling
information on him.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.172
Why is that, Mr. Self?

20:58.674 --> 21:00.759
I'm Homeland Security.

21:01.802 --> 21:02.928
It's my job to
protect people

21:03.011 --> 21:05.973
who make attractive
terrorist targets--

21:06.056 --> 21:07.891
people in upper
ranks of military,

21:07.975 --> 21:09.059
people like Krantz.

21:09.142 --> 21:11.728
Is there a particular threat
I should know about?

21:11.812 --> 21:14.898
Maybe you can debrief me
on the situation.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.026
What's your division?

21:18.110 --> 21:20.070
You want to give me
your clearance level?

21:20.153 --> 21:24.825
I'm a...
hired contractor.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.160
Right.

21:27.244 --> 21:30.038
Well, I usually don't make
a habit of giving civilians

21:30.122 --> 21:33.292
who corner me in underground
parking structures

21:33.375 --> 21:34.835
classified information.

21:36.169 --> 21:37.170
Okay?

21:37.254 --> 21:39.256
So if the General has a problem,
he can call me.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.052
Is there something else
you want to say to me?

21:44.136 --> 21:46.013
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

21:47.472 --> 21:51.184
I'm just here to give you
a little... friendly advice.

21:51.268 --> 21:52.811
What's that?

21:52.894 --> 21:56.064
The General...
he likes his privacy.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.446
That's all.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.466
Yes, so that was Wyatt.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.885
I gotta tell you,
I'm not a big fan

22:24.968 --> 22:26.970
of almost catching
a bullet in my head.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.930
Well, now you know
what it's like.

22:34.227 --> 22:36.104
So, how well
do you know Mahone?

22:37.064 --> 22:38.565
I know he wants to take
down the Company

22:38.648 --> 22:39.816
just as much
as we do.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.986
You also realize
he's a major liability.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.155
I mean, if Wyatt could find me,
he could find Mahone.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.783
And then people...
So get him out.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.576
I told you I can't.

22:50.744 --> 22:53.121
But I can get to him.

22:54.289 --> 22:56.208
I mean, he can
be touched.

22:56.291 --> 22:59.002
I don't know, maybe
Mahone is a stand-up guy.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.213
Or maybe he likes
to run his mouth

23:01.296 --> 23:03.006
to work an angle,
I'm not sure.

23:03.090 --> 23:06.927
But if need be,
I can get rid of that angle.

23:08.095 --> 23:09.513
I can eliminate
that threat.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.183
That's not an option.

23:13.266 --> 23:14.851
Oh, yes, it is.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.354
Okay, because
if a choice has to be made

23:17.437 --> 23:20.232
between him or us...

23:28.657 --> 23:29.616
Hey, Frank.

23:29.699 --> 23:31.284
Got some good news.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.413
Oh, yeah,
what's that?

23:35.747 --> 23:37.165
I can cut you a break.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.128
As easy as that?

23:42.838 --> 23:44.840
Spoke with the manager
down at the racetrack.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.550
Said you were spotted
with another male Caucasian

23:46.633 --> 23:48.176
about ten years your junior.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.595
That sound
about right?

23:50.679 --> 23:52.389
Here come the cops.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.516
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

23:54.599 --> 23:56.393
What was it?

23:56.476 --> 23:58.270
The two of you were gonna go
in there, rob the vault?

23:59.187 --> 24:00.647
Grab as much cash
and get out?

24:00.730 --> 24:01.773
Someone has to
be lookout.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.108
I'll take care
of it. Go!

24:03.191 --> 24:04.734
Look.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.528
Maybe you got a wife
to get home to.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.406
Family.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.491
If you're willing
to give me the name of your accomplice

24:11.575 --> 24:13.201
I think we can change
your charges.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.453
I thought we worked
together, you know.

24:14.536 --> 24:15.620
Help each other out.

24:15.704 --> 24:16.955
You're on your own.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.210
You holler
if you change your mind.

24:28.175 --> 24:30.302
Let's talk about
the fifth cardholder.

24:30.385 --> 24:32.137
The General is requiring

24:32.220 --> 24:35.599
all the cardholders to
have their cards on them at all times,

24:35.682 --> 24:38.768
so Scuderi will have
his card, too.

24:38.852 --> 24:41.354
Now, Scuderi has major security
around his house.

24:41.438 --> 24:42.606
Big fence,
lots of guard dogs.

24:42.689 --> 24:43.982
Where are the documents?

24:44.065 --> 24:45.901
These are from the county
surveyor's office.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.861
It shows the layout
of his property

24:47.944 --> 24:49.779
and its proximity to
every other house on his street.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.740
He has-- surprise, surprise--

24:51.823 --> 24:53.950
a top of the line electronic
alarm system

24:54.034 --> 24:55.327
that will alert him

24:55.410 --> 24:57.037
if there's a breach
in the structure.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.664
If we cut the power--
the alarm goes off.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.166
if we double the power

25:01.249 --> 25:02.751
with a voltage spike

25:02.834 --> 25:04.794
the alarm system,
in order to protect itself

25:04.878 --> 25:06.796
against an overload,
will shut itself down.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.131
And that's how we're getting in.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.299
Then what?

25:09.382 --> 25:10.634
Look, I know what
the score is.

25:10.717 --> 25:11.843
It's every man for himself.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.470
You get left behind
you get locked up.

25:13.553 --> 25:14.638
Tough titties.

25:14.721 --> 25:15.889
Now, I signed on
the dotted line

25:15.972 --> 25:17.557
like everyone else
and I want to know exactly

25:17.641 --> 25:18.808
what I'm doing on this job.

25:18.892 --> 25:22.312
I'm with Bellick on this one.

25:22.395 --> 25:23.897
You know, maybe

25:23.980 --> 25:25.482
we should have a plan
for when the cops get here

25:25.565 --> 25:26.650
'cause if Mahone squeals

25:26.733 --> 25:28.401
they're gonna come real quick.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.320
He's a Fed--
how many deals

25:30.403 --> 25:32.155
do you think this guy's made
in his life?

25:32.239 --> 25:34.324
You think he's just gonna
tuck tail between his legs...

25:34.407 --> 25:35.909
Shut up.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.119
Look, we can sit here
and debate

25:38.203 --> 25:40.664
what Mahone is or is not gonna
do for the rest of the day,

25:40.747 --> 25:41.998
but it comes down to this:

25:42.082 --> 25:45.252
we cannot break him out
of a police station.

25:50.173 --> 25:52.676
One... two...

25:52.759 --> 25:55.220
three, four, five, six--

25:55.303 --> 25:56.888
No. Too big.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.549
Eight by ten.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.518
This is the lowest
gauge I could get.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.145
It's perfect.
Cool.

26:55.655 --> 26:58.283
Well...
I guess, uh...

27:02.078 --> 27:03.872
I guess we're gonna
leave him in jail.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.124
Is that a statement
or a question?

27:07.917 --> 27:09.586
It's just if something
happens to Alex--

27:09.669 --> 27:14.049
if, uh,
if the Company finds him...

27:14.132 --> 27:17.010
If the roles were reversed
and you were the one locked up,

27:17.093 --> 27:19.846
you really think Alex would
risk it all to get you out?

27:21.389 --> 27:22.932
I mean, I don't know,

27:23.016 --> 27:24.017
but...

27:24.809 --> 27:25.769
he was a federal agent.

27:25.852 --> 27:27.812
I think he'd finish
what he started.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.522
I think he'd bring
the Company down.

28:04.974 --> 28:06.643
Can I help you
with something?

28:06.726 --> 28:09.270
Yes, I-I'm here to
see Frank Zwan.

28:09.354 --> 28:10.438
I'm a family friend.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.148
I'm afraid you can't
see him right now.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.901
He's about to be transferred
for his arraignment.

28:23.993 --> 28:25.662
Actually, I'd like
to be there...

28:25.745 --> 28:27.247
for moral support.

28:27.330 --> 28:29.040
Could you tell me
which courthouse?

28:48.226 --> 28:49.269
Hello?

28:50.311 --> 28:51.271
Michael.

28:53.690 --> 28:56.192
Alex, look, I'm sorry.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.819
He found me.

28:57.902 --> 28:59.195
Wyatt-- He showed up
at the station house

28:59.279 --> 29:01.573
where they're holding me.
I don't know how he did it.

29:01.656 --> 29:02.741
I don't know
how he figured it out.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.242
Let me call Agent Self.

29:04.325 --> 29:05.535
No, Michael, listen...

29:05.618 --> 29:06.911
No, maybe he can
get you moved.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.246
It's-it's over for me.
It's done.

29:08.329 --> 29:11.124
It's-- and I'm not gonna
say anything about anything.

29:11.207 --> 29:13.668
But you need to promise me
something, okay?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.211
Okay, what?

29:15.295 --> 29:16.880
Promise me...

29:16.963 --> 29:18.214
that you will
get to Wyatt

29:19.215 --> 29:21.050
and you'll kill
the son of a bitch.

29:21.968 --> 29:24.554
And then you'll call Pam

29:24.637 --> 29:26.264
and you'll tell her
that he's gone.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.475
All right.

29:29.809 --> 29:30.977
I promise.

29:31.686 --> 29:32.896
Okay.

29:37.525 --> 29:38.526
Okay.

29:38.610 --> 29:39.986
All right.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.283
You ready to go?

29:47.619 --> 29:48.828
Michael?

29:51.956 --> 29:53.875
I'm his wife.

29:53.958 --> 29:56.336
I'm sorry,
I'm-I'm still in shock.

29:56.419 --> 29:58.213
I'll be down this afternoon.

29:58.296 --> 29:59.255
Thank you.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.924
Who are you?

30:01.007 --> 30:03.092
I just have some things
I need to take care of.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.345
You don't need to worry.

30:10.558 --> 30:12.477
You have this...

30:12.560 --> 30:14.437
switch inside you.

30:14.521 --> 30:16.481
I don't know how you
could just...

30:16.564 --> 30:18.608
shut yourself off.

30:18.691 --> 30:20.652
You did it when Mom died.

30:20.735 --> 30:22.237
Did it with Emily.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.282
Did it with me.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.329
I do it because it's...

30:36.376 --> 30:37.460
it's just who I am.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.462
No, it's not.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.090
You used to be--

30:42.173 --> 30:43.216
I have to go.

30:44.926 --> 30:47.846
But thank you...
for everything.

30:51.057 --> 30:53.017
So, you're not here
to take her?

30:54.227 --> 30:55.854
If I was capable
of being her mother,

30:55.937 --> 30:57.230
I wouldn't have
given you custody.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.240
You be a good girl,
okay?

31:10.451 --> 31:11.452
Bye, Emily.

31:12.328 --> 31:13.496
Bye, Auntie.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.798
I love you.

31:28.928 --> 31:30.430
Will we see you again?

31:31.264 --> 31:32.390
I don't know.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.536
Call me if it
goes south.

32:22.273 --> 32:26.235
To listen to your messages, press one.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.072
Hey, honey, it's me,
I'm at the grocery store.

32:29.155 --> 32:31.699
I was planning to
make those grilled pork chops,

32:31.783 --> 32:33.159
unless you're not in the mood
for them.

32:33.242 --> 32:35.244
I hope you're having
a great day.

32:51.511 --> 32:54.180
Hey, what are you guys doing?

32:54.305 --> 32:56.224
We'll call you when we're done.

32:56.891 --> 32:58.184
No, wait.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.438
Where are you guys?

33:02.522 --> 33:04.107
Almost ready.

34:32.236 --> 34:33.613
You have a problem.

34:33.696 --> 34:34.864
What's that?

34:36.824 --> 34:38.618
What can I
do you for?

34:38.701 --> 34:40.745
I just-- I've found
some more inconsistencies

34:40.828 --> 34:42.246
in your sales reports.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.625
Actually, many more.

34:45.708 --> 34:48.086
In fact...

34:48.169 --> 34:51.214
kind of looks like fraud,
actually.

34:52.340 --> 34:55.510
I knew you were rotten
from the beginning.

34:55.593 --> 34:57.428
I want you in my office
in five minutes

34:57.512 --> 34:59.097
to walk me
through this,

34:59.180 --> 35:01.015
and if you can't,

35:01.099 --> 35:02.809
well, I'm gonna call
the authorities.

35:21.077 --> 35:23.204
What are you doing?

35:23.287 --> 35:24.747
Nice knowing you, sugar.

35:25.873 --> 35:26.874
Cole, wait.

35:35.424 --> 35:38.052
I was traveling abroad
when he passed away.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.263
Again, I'm very sorry.

35:41.305 --> 35:42.682
Is this your husband?

35:50.106 --> 35:51.190
Yes.

35:51.274 --> 35:52.441
I need to see
some identification

35:52.525 --> 35:54.735
so I can sign over his
personal belongings to you.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.787
So... you and your spouse
had different last names?

36:05.621 --> 36:06.873
That's correct.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.249
I realize
this is an inconvenience,

36:08.332 --> 36:10.042
but I need to see
other documentation

36:10.126 --> 36:11.460
proving you were married.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.339
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

36:17.049 --> 36:18.593
I'm sorry, ma'am.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.678
Rules are rules.

36:37.987 --> 36:40.907
Hey, Mr. Pfeiffer, this is
Crystal from Instahome

36:40.990 --> 36:42.283
getting back to you

36:42.366 --> 36:44.869
just to let you know that the
security deposit check cleared

36:44.952 --> 36:45.953
and your one bedroom is ready.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.788
Okay. Thank you.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.227
Hi, I'm, uh,
representing Frank Zwan.

37:09.310 --> 37:10.561
I'm going to need his jacket
from you.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.521
I've been informed
he's going indigent.

37:12.605 --> 37:13.481
Uh, he was.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.066
His mother in Santa
Barbara, however, is not,

37:15.149 --> 37:16.567
and she retained
me this morning.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.157
Be my guest.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.408
Much obliged.

37:36.671 --> 37:37.755
Five.

37:41.133 --> 37:42.426
Four.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.223
Three.

37:50.017 --> 37:51.435
Sir, sir.

37:51.519 --> 37:52.687
Two.

37:52.770 --> 37:53.854
Please take
a seat.

38:01.195 --> 38:02.113
One.

38:02.196 --> 38:03.281
One.

38:22.008 --> 38:25.136
Make your way to the exits
in an orderly fashion, please.

38:25.219 --> 38:27.305
Let's go, people, move it.

39:14.852 --> 39:16.354
All right,
let's get out of here.

40:08.989 --> 40:11.450
I don't know
if, uh, you guys...

40:12.284 --> 40:13.619
did this for the team
or if you did it

40:13.702 --> 40:15.704
for me, and...

40:15.788 --> 40:16.747
I don't care.

40:17.540 --> 40:18.666
I just...

40:20.292 --> 40:21.544
Thank you.

41:10.593 --> 41:11.635
Yes.

41:13.345 --> 41:15.222
I got your message.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.516
I was wondering
when you were going to call.

41:20.060 --> 41:23.606
You told my wife you wanted me
to turn myself in.

41:23.689 --> 41:26.942
So, uh, why don't you tell me
where to go and I'll meet you?

41:28.694 --> 41:29.987
Let's get this over with.

41:30.779 --> 41:32.448
This thing is
far from over,

41:32.531 --> 41:33.866
Alex.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.161
First I find Sara Tancredi here,

41:37.244 --> 41:39.622
then you.

41:39.705 --> 41:42.541
Seems like there's a great deal
of things for us to talk about.

41:42.625 --> 41:43.542
Oh, no.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.127
No, no, no.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.340
There's only one thing
for you and I to discuss.

41:49.423 --> 41:52.343
You worked
for the Company once, Alex.

41:52.426 --> 41:55.596
You should know better than
to take things so personally.

41:55.679 --> 41:56.972
I'm gonna wrap this up,

41:57.056 --> 41:59.475
just in case you decided
to trace this call,

41:59.558 --> 42:01.101
but I promise you...

42:02.353 --> 42:06.148
we will meet again,
and when we do,

42:06.232 --> 42:08.901
I'm going to show you just
how personal things can get.

42:10.402 --> 42:11.487
Oh, yeah.

42:53.779 --> 42:55.531
Cole Pfeiffer.

42:57.408 --> 42:58.951
What you gonna do now?

43:04.790 --> 43:06.333
Who the hell are you?

43:47.833 --> 43:49.835
