12:07.023 --> 12:09.010
- SHE CAN'T DO THAT!

12:09.012 --> 12:12.001
- HEY!
LET IT GO, BUTTERCUP.

12:12.003 --> 12:14.005
THAT BABY IS PUNISHMENT ENOUGH.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.025
- AND SO, ONCE AGAIN,
THE DIAPER IS CHANGED,

12:19.027 --> 12:22.014
THANKS TO THE POWERPUFF GIRLS!

12:22.016 --> 12:24.018
OOH! HOLD THE CHILI.

12:43.025 --> 12:45.027
THE CITY OF TOWNSVILLE,

12:45.029 --> 12:48.010
WHERE IT IS
A BEAUTIFUL, SUNNY DAY,

12:48.012 --> 12:51.005
AND THERE'S NOT A SIGN
OF TROUBLE ON THE--HUH?

12:51.007 --> 12:52.011
[SMACK]
UGH!

12:52.013 --> 12:53.005
[WHAP]
UNH!

12:53.007 --> 12:55.009
[GRUNTING AND SMACKING]

12:59.012 --> 13:01.025
- THE CITY OF TOWNSVILLE--

13:01.027 --> 13:04.014
A CITY THAT
WHILE BEING A CITY,

13:04.016 --> 13:07.003
IS FOR SOME INEXPLICABLE REASON
CALLED "TOWN."

13:07.005 --> 13:09.009
AND NOT ONLY IS IT CALLED
A TOWN, BUT ALSO A "VILLE,"

13:09.011 --> 13:11.014
THUS MAKING IT A CITY, TOWN,
AND VILLAGE--

13:11.016 --> 13:14.004
WHICH SEEMS TO ME TO BE
REDUNDANT AND REPETITIVE,

13:14.006 --> 13:16.000
WHICH CAN BE QUITE ANNOYING
IF YOU ASK ME.

13:16.002 --> 13:17.028
WHICH YOU HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO DO,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.018
FOR NOW I, MOJO JOJO,
AM IN CHARGE OF...

13:21.020 --> 13:23.021
THE CITY OF TOWNSVILLE,

13:23.023 --> 13:25.022
WHERE IT IS BEAUTIFUL
AND SUNNY.

13:25.024 --> 13:27.013
AND FRANKLY, I'M TIRED OF IT!

13:27.015 --> 13:30.020
SO, I SAY INSTEAD,
THE CITY OF TOWNSVILLE,

13:30.022 --> 13:33.001
WHERE IT IS A LITTLE OVERCAST,

13:33.003 --> 13:34.018
THUS CUTTING DOWN ON
THE INCESSANT HEAT WAVE

13:34.020 --> 13:36.004
WE'VE BEEN HAVING.

13:36.006 --> 13:39.020
AND IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS
CITY, TOWN, VILLE, WHATEVER,

13:39.022 --> 13:43.029
AT THE UTONIUM CHATEAU,
THERE ARE 3 LITTLE GIRLS--

13:44.001 --> 13:47.001
BLOSSOM, BUBBLES,
AND BUTTERCUP.

13:47.003 --> 13:50.006
- GEE, THE WEATHER SURE
DID CHANGE SUDDENLY.

13:50.008 --> 13:52.008
- AND THOUGH THEY THOUGHT
THEY WOULD BE SPENDING

13:52.010 --> 13:54.003
A PEACEFUL DAY AT HOME,

13:54.005 --> 13:57.003
THEY HURRIEDLY HEAD FOR THE CITY
TO DO MY BIDDING!

13:57.005 --> 13:59.017
- HMM. FOR SOME STRANGE REASON,

13:59.019 --> 14:01.012
I FEEL COMPELLED TO GO
INTO THE CITY.

14:01.014 --> 14:04.014
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
LET'S GO.

14:06.007 --> 14:10.011
- AS THEY HEAD OUT, THEY PASS BY
THEIR FATHER OF SORTS,

14:10.013 --> 14:12.004
PROFESSOR UTONIUM.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.016
- HI, GIRLS.

14:14.018 --> 14:16.007
LOOK WHAT I JUST DUG UP
FROM THE GARAGE.

14:16.009 --> 14:19.008
IT'S MY OLD PSEUDO-
SUBATOMIC-QUASAR-DEBABBLER.

14:19.010 --> 14:22.015
IT PICKS UP INTERGALACTIC
RADIO WAVES FROM DISTANT STARS

14:22.017 --> 14:25.001
AND DECODES THEM
INTO CRACKLES AND POPS.

14:25.003 --> 14:28.020
HA HA! THE HOURS WE WOULD SIT
THERE ENTHRALLED

14:28.022 --> 14:30.027
BY THE SOUNDS OF COSMIC STATIC!

14:30.029 --> 14:32.010
- BLAH BLAH BLAH,

14:32.012 --> 14:35.013
I GROW TIRED OF PROFESSOR
UTONIUM'S ENDLESS BANTER.

14:35.015 --> 14:38.029
AND AS I GROW TIRED OF IT,
SO DO THE POWERPUFF GIRLS,

14:39.001 --> 14:42.002
FOR I AM IN CONTROL!

14:42.004 --> 14:44.021
- IS THAT ALL, PROFESSOR?
WE'RE KIND OF IN A HURRY.

14:44.023 --> 14:46.004
- WELL, I JUST THOUGHT I'D SHARE

14:46.006 --> 14:48.002
A BIT OF UTONIUM HISTORY
WITH YOU.

14:48.004 --> 14:51.010
- AH, SHUT UP!
WHAT JUST HAPPENED THERE?

14:51.012 --> 14:53.019
- UM, I THINK YOU JUST DISSED
THE PROFESSOR.

14:53.021 --> 14:55.016
- SOMETHING'S WRONG HERE.

14:55.018 --> 14:58.029
- OH, WELL, I, UM, DON'T WANT
TO KEEP YOU GIRLS

14:59.001 --> 15:00.016
FROM ANY IMPORTANT BUSINESS.

15:00.018 --> 15:02.007
- I'M SORRY, PROFESSOR.

15:02.009 --> 15:04.006
WE'RE JUST IN A REAL HURRY
TO GET INTO TOWN.

15:04.008 --> 15:06.027
- OH, DON'T MENTION IT.
HA! I UNDERSTAND.

15:06.029 --> 15:08.024
WHY, I REMEMBER
WHEN THE PREMIERE ISSUE

15:08.026 --> 15:10.027
OF "EXTREME CHEMICAL PHYSICS"
CAME OUT.

15:10.029 --> 15:14.012
WHY, I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO GET
A COPY, I--

15:16.006 --> 15:19.003
UH, OH, IS THE LATEST ISSUE
OUT ALREADY?

15:19.005 --> 15:21.020
- AS THE GIRLS HEAD TO THE CITY
IN A HURRIED MANNER,

15:21.022 --> 15:24.000
THEY--WAIT A MINUTE!
HOLD UP!

15:26.003 --> 15:29.002
- OH, I CAN'T WAIT TO GIVE
THIS BABY A WHIRL!

15:29.004 --> 15:31.027
- AND TO THE PROFESSOR,
THEY EACH GAVE A SWIFT KICK.

15:31.029 --> 15:33.028
WHY? BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HIM!

15:34.000 --> 15:35.015
NO! NOT ONE BIT!

15:35.017 --> 15:38.028
- HMM. MAYBE I SHOULD CURB
THEIR SUGAR INTAKE.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.014
- AND OFF THOSE GIRLS FLY
TO THE CITY--

15:41.016 --> 15:43.010
NO, WALK!

15:54.020 --> 15:57.018
- UGH! WHOSE DUMB IDEA WAS IT
TO WALK, ANYWAY?

15:57.020 --> 16:00.009
ANYONE CAN SEE THESE FEET
AREN'T DESIGNED FOR WALKING.

16:00.011 --> 16:02.015
- AT LEAST IT'S NOT RAINING.

16:02.017 --> 16:05.006
- THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

16:10.009 --> 16:14.012
AND SO, THE POWERPUFF GIRLS
STEAL MANY JEWELS TO MY LIKING--

16:14.014 --> 16:16.000
MEANING THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONES
WHICH CONTAIN

16:16.002 --> 16:19.009
THE TOPMOST QUALITY AND CLARITY.

16:19.011 --> 16:21.007
- NICE.

16:23.024 --> 16:26.010
- THEN, THEY HEAD TO THE BANK.

16:26.012 --> 16:27.010
[BOOM]

16:27.012 --> 16:29.014
- THANKS!

16:32.022 --> 16:34.010
- UM...YOU'RE WELCOME?

16:34.012 --> 16:38.005
- AND NEXT, IT IS OFF
TO THE MUSEUM WHERE--HOLD UP.

16:38.007 --> 16:41.008
WHILE FLYING PAST
TOWNSVILLE HALL,

16:41.010 --> 16:45.011
THE GIRLS STOP IN AND GIVE
THAT MAYOR A SWIFT KICK AS WELL!

16:45.013 --> 16:48.024
- POWERPUFF GIRLS!
TO WHAT DO I OWE THE PLEASURE?

16:48.026 --> 16:51.004

17:02.020 --> 17:04.001
OH, MR. PICKLE.

17:04.003 --> 17:07.028
- THEN, OFF TO THE MUSEUM,
WHERE FINE ART IS PROCURED,

17:08.000 --> 17:09.004
AND THE FINER THE BETTER.

17:09.006 --> 17:11.024

17:19.012 --> 17:22.023
UPON ARRIVING, THE GIRLS DO NOT
CRASH THROUGH THE CEILING,

17:22.025 --> 17:26.002
WHICH HAS COST THE OWNER OF
SAID LAIR INNUMERABLE DOLLARS.

17:32.023 --> 17:35.001
BUT GO THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR.

17:37.002 --> 17:41.004
THEN, THEY...WIPE THEIR FEET!

- CAREFULLY, THEY PUT THE BOOTY
IN THEIR DESIGNATED PLACES

17:57.010 --> 17:59.012
