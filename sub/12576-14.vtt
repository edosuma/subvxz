no time to eat
.

00:40.538 --> 00:42.123
I have to get this
valentine done,

00:42.123 --> 00:43.374
so I can mail it
by tomorrow.

00:43.374 --> 00:45.460
Well, at least
eat the butter, bobby.

00:45.460 --> 00:47.295
It's loaded with vitamin a.

00:48.796 --> 00:51.466
What's this, bobby?
Have a girlfriend? Ha.

00:51.466 --> 00:52.250
shh.

00:52.633 --> 00:55.636
"happy valentine's day,
joseph."

00:55.636 --> 00:57.221
"love, bobby"?

00:57.221 --> 00:58.723
"hey, hot stuff"?

00:58.723 --> 01:00.725
Bobby, you can't
give this to joseph.

01:00.725 --> 01:03.177
Why not?
He is hot stuff.

01:03.177 --> 01:05.012
You should see
him skateboard
.

01:05.012 --> 01:08.933
bobby,if you give a valentine
to a 6th-grade boy,

01:08.933 --> 01:11.519
girls are gonna
think you're sensitive.

01:12.019 --> 01:13.020
And somethin' like that

01:13.020 --> 01:14.822
can follow you
the rest o' your life.

01:14.822 --> 01:16.691
Now, here's
a candy for joseph.

01:16.691 --> 01:19.744
It says, "hey, you're ok."

01:19.744 --> 01:22.330
And we'll just put this card
over here for now.

01:22.330 --> 01:24.582
All right, I can use that.

01:25.917 --> 01:27.418
Who's your valentine, luanne?

01:27.418 --> 01:28.669
me.

01:29.170 --> 01:32.173
Since buckley said
he's gonna forget
valentine's day again,

01:32.173 --> 01:35.676
I finally made myself realize
that to love yourself,

01:35.676 --> 01:37.678
that's
the greatest love of all.

01:37.678 --> 01:39.013
Isn't that right, aunt peggy?

01:39.430 --> 01:40.715
Um, no.

01:40.715 --> 01:43.968
Um, no. That's not really
true at all, in fact.

01:44.469 --> 01:45.803
[sighs]

01:45.803 --> 01:48.806
love between 2 people
is the greatest thing
that there is.

01:48.806 --> 01:50.641
At least, that's true
of uncle hank and i.

01:50.641 --> 01:53.060
Would you like to hear
the story of how
we first realized

01:53.060 --> 01:54.562
we were meant to be together?

01:54.562 --> 01:56.063
I'm listenin'.

01:56.063 --> 01:59.617
Well, our first
valentine's day, we weren't
even in the same room.

02:00.118 --> 02:02.820
But I have to say,
it may have been
our most romantic.

02:09.577 --> 02:11.212
(peggy)
my school, west arlen,

02:11.212 --> 02:14.665
was playing hank's school,
arlen high.

02:15.166 --> 02:17.752
Hank and I had been dating
about 6 months

02:17.752 --> 02:20.505
and things were
really heating up.

02:20.505 --> 02:21.672
Miss platter, hello.

02:21.672 --> 02:23.674
Well, hello to you, Mr. Hill.

02:23.674 --> 02:25.676
Take it easy on
our girls, ok?

02:25.676 --> 02:27.812
I certainly will not.

02:27.812 --> 02:28.813
heh.

02:28.813 --> 02:32.150
You know, um,
valentine's is comin' up.

02:32.567 --> 02:35.853
Yeah. One of the girls
had mentioned that
on the bus ride.

02:35.853 --> 02:38.523
Yeah, um,
some of the other guys,

02:38.523 --> 02:40.858
you know, their girlfriend
s are making 'em dinner.

02:42.276 --> 02:43.528
oh.

02:43.528 --> 02:44.362
So...

02:44.862 --> 02:45.863
So, you...

02:45.863 --> 02:47.281
Uh...

02:47.281 --> 02:50.618
Yeah, I was thinkin',
maybe you could be
makin' me dinner.

02:50.618 --> 02:51.619
Yeah, I could--

02:51.619 --> 02:54.172
That's a great idea.
I could make you dinner.

02:54.672 --> 02:56.174
All right.

02:56.174 --> 02:57.675
.
All right.
I'll see you later

02:59.844 --> 03:00.928
hon, this is so cute.

03:00.928 --> 03:03.714
Your first big meal.
It must--

03:03.714 --> 03:05.716
Peggy,
you are not trying to make--

03:05.716 --> 03:08.019
That's right.
Beef wellington.

03:08.019 --> 03:09.720
?
Cherry pie

03:09.720 --> 03:11.389
why not just build him
a rocket ship?

03:11.389 --> 03:12.690
Mom, would you stop it?

03:12.690 --> 03:15.059
He is my boyfriend,
it is my dinner,
I will cook it.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.062
But, peggy, if hank discovers
you cannot even bake,

03:18.062 --> 03:19.313
it is all over.

03:19.313 --> 03:21.365
?
You think I can't see that

03:21.365 --> 03:22.867
do not say "can't."

03:22.867 --> 03:25.369
You will not use contractions
in this house.

03:52.396 --> 03:53.397
why me?

03:55.266 --> 03:57.068
Phone call for you, dear.

03:58.102 --> 04:00.688
Your eyebrows look very nice.

04:01.188 --> 04:01.989
Hello?

04:02.406 --> 04:03.908
Hi, peggy, I'm really sorry,

04:04.408 --> 04:06.410
but I pulled
some tendons in my back,

04:06.410 --> 04:08.412
and I can't come
over for dinner.

04:08.412 --> 04:09.163
(peggy)
you can't?

04:09.163 --> 04:11.082
Ah, don't cry, peggy.

04:11.082 --> 04:13.584
I'm sorry I ruined
your valentine's day.

04:13.584 --> 04:17.672
.
You didn't. I mean,
i'm just so glad you're ok

04:17.672 --> 04:19.589
uh, but I'm not ok.

04:19.589 --> 04:20.591
Uh-huh.

04:20.591 --> 04:22.877
I bet I'm missin'
a great dinner, huh?

04:22.877 --> 04:24.178
.
I made beef wellington

04:24.178 --> 04:25.096
really?

04:25.429 --> 04:26.264
Is that steak?

04:26.264 --> 04:27.098
Yes, sir.

04:27.098 --> 04:29.600
And I made a cherry pie.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.936
And a blueberry pie.

04:31.936 --> 04:34.438
Wow, peggy,
I love both those pies!

04:34.772 --> 04:37.224
Hey, hold one of them
up to the phone
so I can smell it.

04:38.359 --> 04:40.728
I'm holding one up to
the phone right now.

04:41.612 --> 04:42.863
Oh, it's hot.

04:43.281 --> 04:46.284
Oh, yeah.
I'm just imaginin' eatin' it.

04:46.284 --> 04:47.285
mmm.

04:48.286 --> 04:49.537
So tasty.

04:49.820 --> 04:51.739
And the soup
I made is good, too.

04:51.739 --> 04:54.292
Cream of beef wellington.

04:54.292 --> 04:55.793
Mmm, my favorite.

04:56.294 --> 04:57.411
Oh, you dropped
a little on your chin.

04:57.912 --> 04:58.412
Uh-huh.

04:58.913 --> 04:59.914
I dabbed it with a napkin.

04:59.914 --> 05:01.415
Uh-huh.

05:01.415 --> 05:03.417
Oh, no, you got
a little on your earlobe.
I'll get it.

05:03.417 --> 05:04.418
Heh-heh.

05:04.418 --> 05:06.921
I'm just a big, clumsy guy.

05:06.921 --> 05:08.172
[giggles]

05:11.759 --> 05:13.260
2 weeks later,
when his back healed,

05:13.761 --> 05:16.179
we were engaged to be engaged.

05:16.179 --> 05:18.348
You know, if I hadn't
hurt my back that day,

05:18.848 --> 05:20.350
I would've known
she couldn't cook.

05:20.350 --> 05:21.851
And then I
would've been forced

05:21.851 --> 05:23.186
to not marry
this little gal.

05:23.687 --> 05:24.354
wow!

05:24.854 --> 05:26.856
So, I guess what
they say is true,

05:26.856 --> 05:29.159
there is somebody out ther
e for everybody.

05:29.492 --> 05:30.493
huh?

05:30.493 --> 05:32.662
No, I don't think
that follows at all, luanne.

05:33.113 --> 05:35.081
Nope, not for everybody.
Uh-uh.

05:35.081 --> 05:36.366
oh.

05:36.366 --> 05:37.333
Oh, guess what else.

05:37.834 --> 05:39.335
I'm gonna see that
old school today.

05:39.335 --> 05:41.171
I'm subbin' for
the record keeper.

05:41.171 --> 05:42.672
The old high school, huh?

05:42.672 --> 05:45.458
,
Boy! I haven't
been there since, what

05:45.458 --> 05:47.761
the season ended,
I guess, almost,

05:47.761 --> 05:49.763
uh, 2 months ago.

05:50.263 --> 05:51.765
Yep, 2 months.

05:54.634 --> 05:56.636
.
Got a package
for you, bobby

05:58.938 --> 06:03.943
"happy valentine's day.
Love, your secret admirer.

06:04.444 --> 06:07.447
p.s.
Expect me valentine's night"?

06:07.447 --> 06:08.698
Whoah.

06:08.698 --> 06:12.152
Who could it be?
The only girl you
ever talk to is connie.

06:12.152 --> 06:13.153
I know.

06:13.653 --> 06:14.654
hey!

06:14.654 --> 06:16.456
It could be kerri strug!

06:16.873 --> 06:19.375
At least,
I hope it's kerri strug.

too closely."

06:31.221 --> 06:32.589
You don't see that much.

06:32.589 --> 06:33.890
Oh, this takes me back.

06:34.224 --> 06:36.342
Rhonda culpepper.
I went to school with her.

06:36.342 --> 06:38.645
Did you know
she was a code 42?

06:38.645 --> 06:40.063
[gasps]

06:40.063 --> 06:43.266
no. I just thought
she'd gotten fat
for a semester.

06:43.266 --> 06:45.568
Hey, I think we know
this character.

06:45.568 --> 06:47.904
Becky, we are not
paid to snoop.

06:47.904 --> 06:50.406
All right, then.

06:50.406 --> 06:53.409
"hank hill,
permanent record file 5402."

06:54.744 --> 06:56.112
[keyboard clacking]

06:57.030 --> 07:00.283
.
give me that freakin' file

07:00.283 --> 07:04.170

kicked out of chorus
for refusing to sing

07:04.170 --> 07:05.922

the flowers gone?"

07:13.680 --> 07:16.099
.
Yep. Hank hurt
his back that week

07:16.099 --> 07:18.134
it's one of our favorite stories.

07:18.134 --> 07:20.436
Oh, peggy, you don't
have to lie to me.

07:20.436 --> 07:21.688
So he had mono.

07:21.688 --> 07:22.939
It was 20 years ago.

07:22.939 --> 07:23.723
Mono?

07:24.224 --> 07:25.225
The "kissing disease"?

07:25.225 --> 07:27.977
You two must have
been very busy
that valentine's day.

07:28.478 --> 07:30.864
.
Becky, I never had
mono in my entire life

07:30.864 --> 07:32.115
oh!

07:38.788 --> 07:39.789
[gulping]

07:41.207 --> 07:42.208
hey, hank,

07:42.208 --> 07:43.710
did you ever wonder what it'd be like

07:44.210 --> 07:46.379
to drink beer
standin' over there?

07:46.379 --> 07:48.248
Curiosity
killed the cat, Dale.

07:53.553 --> 07:55.054
Hello, my husband.

07:55.054 --> 07:57.891
I was just thinkin' about
some of your
high-school football days.

07:58.308 --> 08:00.810
Well, good.
That's a good thing
to be thinkin' about.

08:00.810 --> 08:01.811
Uh-huh.

08:02.312 --> 08:03.813
You know, like,
when you hurt your back

08:03.813 --> 08:05.815
and you were out
for a few weeks?

08:05.815 --> 08:07.317
Oh, yeah, yeah,

08:07.317 --> 08:11.321
I took a pretty big hit,
I tell you what! Heh, heh.

08:11.321 --> 08:14.324
You know,
a funny thing happened today.

08:14.324 --> 08:16.826
I took a look in
your permanent record
and it says,

08:16.826 --> 08:19.529
you had mono those 2 weeks.

08:19.529 --> 08:21.364
How did you get mono, hank?

08:22.782 --> 08:24.284
Uh, well,

08:24.284 --> 08:28.288
I happened to share
a soda with a guy
on the team one day.

08:28.288 --> 08:30.039
It was the '70s, you know.

08:30.039 --> 08:31.424
That's funny.

08:31.424 --> 08:33.426
You know, on the way out
of the building,

08:33.426 --> 08:34.928
I stopped by
the school nurse's office.

08:34.928 --> 08:37.513
She did not mention
that you could
get mono that way.

08:37.513 --> 08:40.850
Well, I wouldn't put
too much stock in
what that woman said,

08:41.134 --> 08:42.467
if you know what I mean.

08:42.467 --> 08:44.470
[gulping]

08:44.470 --> 08:45.471
(peggy)
oh.

08:46.272 --> 08:48.274
well,
I wasn't aware of that.

08:48.274 --> 08:50.276
For a moment there,
I thought...

08:50.276 --> 08:52.612
Well, never mind
what I thought.

08:54.530 --> 08:57.367
She's on the trail.
She's gonna find out.

08:57.367 --> 08:58.368
No, she's not.

08:58.735 --> 09:00.203
Unless you let
somethin' slip.

09:00.203 --> 09:01.988
I don't let
things slip, hank.

09:01.988 --> 09:03.489
I place information.

09:06.292 --> 09:09.128
Normally I'd share
these chocolates
with you all.

09:09.128 --> 09:11.631
It's just that these came
from my secret admirer,

09:12.131 --> 09:13.499
so they're kinda special.

09:13.499 --> 09:15.468
You know what's funny?

09:15.468 --> 09:17.470
We were talking
about kerri strug, like,
2 days ago, remember?

09:17.971 --> 09:18.972
Now you get
this valentine.

09:18.972 --> 09:20.256
It's probably from
kerri strug.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.141
Why do you think
she's so great?

09:22.141 --> 09:24.143
So she does gymnastics.
So what?

09:24.143 --> 09:25.645
Let's see her play violin.

09:25.645 --> 09:27.597
Besides, she's in her 30s.
They don't tell you that.

09:28.147 --> 09:30.149
You're missing the point,
connie.

09:30.650 --> 09:33.019
She had a broken leg and--

09:33.519 --> 09:36.072
[choking]
and she just kept goin'.

09:43.496 --> 09:44.998
I think connie likes you.

09:45.498 --> 09:48.117
Well, see,
once one girl likes you,

09:48.117 --> 09:50.420
it's like havin'
a ring on your finger.

09:59.462 --> 10:02.715
Beck, when you were entering
the records for
hank's senior class,

10:02.715 --> 10:05.218
did you notice anyone else
on the football team
with mono?

10:05.218 --> 10:08.471
Oh, hon, you just can't get it
out of your head, can you?

10:08.471 --> 10:09.856
Oh, I know it seems silly.

10:09.856 --> 10:11.975
I don't-- I just,
i--i'm afraid I can't.

10:11.975 --> 10:14.644
Well, neither could i.
I already did the search.

10:14.644 --> 10:17.613
There weren't any
other football players
with mono.

10:17.613 --> 10:20.984
Unless a girl named amy edlin
was on the team.

10:21.401 --> 10:23.319
who?

10:23.319 --> 10:25.905
So the whore
"played well with others,"
did she?

10:27.540 --> 10:30.043
This--this girl could have
been drinking a soda,

10:30.043 --> 10:32.545
and--and she set it down
next to a football player,

10:32.545 --> 10:35.331
and hank assumed
it belonged to
said player and--

10:35.331 --> 10:36.082
That's it, peggy.

10:36.382 --> 10:37.383
You just take that lie

10:37.383 --> 10:39.669
and wrap it around yoursel
f like a warm blanket.

10:39.669 --> 10:42.171
Well, I don't know
it's a lie, yet.

10:42.171 --> 10:44.057
I looked up amy edlin
in the phone book,

10:44.057 --> 10:46.642
and by posing as
a college-bound
telemarketer,

10:46.642 --> 10:48.144
I found out where she works.

10:48.144 --> 10:51.064
And I'm going to visit
her today, and I am
gonna get to the truth.

10:51.064 --> 10:53.182
You are making
a big mistake, shug.

10:53.182 --> 10:54.484
.
The truth is like sunlight

10:54.484 --> 10:57.103
people used to think
it was good for you.

10:58.438 --> 10:59.572
What do you want
to get her?

10:59.572 --> 11:02.191
Something romantic and frilly.

11:02.191 --> 11:04.494
Like the wife of
a magician would wear.

11:15.288 --> 11:17.790
It's compulsory that
you be my valentine.

11:24.797 --> 11:26.299
[grunting]

11:26.299 --> 11:27.183
yeah.

11:30.686 --> 11:31.971
Oh, man!

11:39.362 --> 11:40.696
Hello.
ahh!

11:41.030 --> 11:42.532
[both gasping]

11:47.570 --> 11:49.122
care to try a saus-trich?

11:49.122 --> 11:50.623
Oh, no.

11:50.623 --> 11:52.575
Wife won't forgive me
if I spoil my dinner.

11:52.575 --> 11:55.411
Is she here? I don't see her.

11:55.411 --> 11:58.498
Well, maybe just this once.

12:02.250 --> 12:03.134
Care to try a saus-trich?

12:03.134 --> 12:04.636
No, thank you.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.638
What I'm here for
does not fit on a toothpick,

12:06.638 --> 12:08.640
and it certainly
is not made of ostrich meat.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.141
It is called the truth.

12:10.558 --> 12:12.811
.
All right.
There is some turkey in it

12:13.094 --> 12:14.596
yes, I assumed that.

12:14.596 --> 12:16.097
Let me put this another way.

12:16.097 --> 12:18.600
I want to talk about what,
if anything,

12:18.600 --> 12:21.102
happened between you
and a boy named hank hill

12:21.102 --> 12:23.104
in february
about 20 years ago.

12:23.104 --> 12:24.773
Does that ring a bell?

12:25.273 --> 12:26.107
Who are you?

12:26.107 --> 12:27.575
I am a lot of things.

12:27.575 --> 12:29.577
I am a mother, I am a teacher,

12:30.078 --> 12:31.579
and I am a wife
with some questions

12:31.579 --> 12:34.082
that desperately
need to be answered.

12:34.082 --> 12:36.668
They call me peggy hill.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.670
,
It was a few weeks
before valentine's

12:38.670 --> 12:41.673
.
and my boyfriend
had just broken up with me

12:41.673 --> 12:43.625
(amy)
I guess I just had
something to prove.

12:43.625 --> 12:45.126
It could've been anybody.

12:51.716 --> 12:54.719
Oh, no! Can somebody help me?

12:54.719 --> 12:56.972
My bells are
caught in my bike chain.

12:56.972 --> 12:59.474
Don't struggle,
you'll only make it worse.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.476
I just feel so helpless,

13:01.476 --> 13:03.478
.
ever since
my boyfriend..

13:03.979 --> 13:05.480
Was killed

13:05.480 --> 13:06.815
in the jungles of vietnam.

13:07.282 --> 13:10.535
Oh, darn!
I'm so sorry about your loss.

13:10.902 --> 13:13.705
You're very brave to bicycle
in the state you're in.

13:16.541 --> 13:18.743
Thank you.
You've helped me so much.

13:19.544 --> 13:20.462
[smacking]

13:20.462 --> 13:22.964
what?
No, no, I have a girlfriend.

13:22.964 --> 13:25.300
Is she here?
I don't see her.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.218
Yeah, but no.

13:27.218 --> 13:27.836
Come here.

13:28.336 --> 13:29.337
Stop.

13:29.337 --> 13:30.338
Don't-- stop.

13:30.338 --> 13:31.339
So sweet. Mmm.

13:32.841 --> 13:34.342
Oh. Oh.

13:37.395 --> 13:38.897
So that's the story.

13:38.897 --> 13:40.899
Here. This coupon
won't take away the pain,

13:40.899 --> 13:44.402
but it will take 30 cents off
your next purchase
of saus-trich.

13:44.402 --> 13:48.523
Saus-trich lite,
and our new
deli-style saus-trami.

13:48.523 --> 13:51.826
Well, thank you for telling me
the truth about my husband.

13:51.826 --> 13:54.162
You have really
eased my mind.

13:56.448 --> 13:57.999
[shrieking]

13:59.784 --> 14:00.785
[gasping]

14:06.708 --> 14:09.210
peggy,
it was over 20 years ago.

14:09.711 --> 14:10.845
No, no, sir!

14:10.845 --> 14:13.098
It was just yesterday
that we told luanne

14:13.098 --> 14:16.384
the story of how your bad back
saved our relationship,
remember?

14:16.384 --> 14:19.888
And that means you have
been lying every single da
y since high school.

14:19.888 --> 14:22.390
That is thousands
and thousands of lies.

14:22.390 --> 14:24.893
Ok, it's true. I did lie.

14:24.893 --> 14:25.860
.
Uh-huh

14:25.860 --> 14:28.613
oh, it feels great
to get that off my chest.

14:28.613 --> 14:31.116
Give me a hug.
I've never felt
closer to you.

14:31.616 --> 14:34.486
.
Back off, mister.
I do not feel close to you

14:34.486 --> 14:38.373
peggy, you got to understand.
I was 17-years-old.

14:38.373 --> 14:41.376
I'd spent most of
my teenage years
working on my offense.

14:41.876 --> 14:42.710
I had no defense.

14:43.078 --> 14:44.412
Then, why didn't you
just tell me?

14:44.412 --> 14:46.214
.
I would have
forgiven you, hank

14:46.581 --> 14:49.384
I mean, I made out
with plenty of guy
s behind your back.

14:49.384 --> 14:50.335
What?

14:50.335 --> 14:51.836
Of course, I did not.

14:51.836 --> 14:53.838
But now you know
how it feels.

14:54.339 --> 14:55.256
So we're even?

14:55.256 --> 14:57.258
.
Oh, no, we are not

14:58.560 --> 15:00.061
hank, I could
forgive the kissing.

15:00.061 --> 15:02.063
I can even forgive the lyin'.

15:02.063 --> 15:04.265
But there's one thing
I cannot forgive.

15:04.766 --> 15:08.770
Our marriage was built
on a wonderful
little romantic story.

15:09.270 --> 15:10.271
Hank, in my opinion,

15:10.271 --> 15:13.274
it was the 2nd greates
t story ever told.

15:13.274 --> 15:15.777
But now,
now we have no story.

15:15.777 --> 15:18.746
All we have is a-- is
a big side of beef
and 3 broken ribs.

15:19.197 --> 15:22.450
You break it, you buy it.
That's pink & white for you.

15:24.919 --> 15:26.421
So here's the plan.

15:26.421 --> 15:27.872
When my secret admirer
comes to the door,

15:28.456 --> 15:30.341
you say hello.

15:30.341 --> 15:33.428
Offer her a drink.
Compliment her dress

15:33.428 --> 15:34.762
or leotard.

15:34.762 --> 15:37.098
y
Oh, you're so luck

15:37.098 --> 15:38.883
that somebody
loves you, bobby.

15:39.384 --> 15:42.604
Right now, I'd give anything
just to have someone say,

15:42.604 --> 15:44.939
"happy
valentine's day, luanne."

15:44.939 --> 15:46.858
Oh, luanne,

15:47.358 --> 15:49.144
have you heard a word I said?

15:51.029 --> 15:53.481
Morning, peggy
. What did you d
o to your hair?

15:53.982 --> 15:57.368
.
Nothin'.
That's exactly it. Nothin'

15:57.368 --> 15:58.703
huh.

15:59.204 --> 16:00.705
bye, mom.
I'm off to school.

16:00.705 --> 16:02.707
Bye, sweetie.
I love you, baby.

16:02.707 --> 16:05.376
Uh, I guess
i'll be leaving, too, hon.

16:05.376 --> 16:06.377
Whatever.

16:06.377 --> 16:07.378
Love you.

16:07.879 --> 16:08.880
Right.

16:09.380 --> 16:10.381
oh.

16:12.083 --> 16:14.669
Hey, I didn't know peggy's
brother was in town.

16:14.919 --> 16:16.921
ow!

16:16.921 --> 16:19.507
o
There's so many
little things that women d

16:19.507 --> 16:21.509
that you just sort of
take for granted.

16:21.509 --> 16:24.095
Now peggy's stopped
doin' all of them.

16:24.095 --> 16:26.097
It's like she's
just some mopey gal

16:26.598 --> 16:28.316
with big feet who
lives in my house.

16:28.650 --> 16:32.270
You gotta do something
that sweeps her off
those big feet, hank.

16:32.270 --> 16:34.572
Toss a little woo at her,
see what sticks.

16:34.572 --> 16:35.740
I don't know.

16:35.740 --> 16:37.742
I used up
all my good material

16:37.742 --> 16:39.494
winning peggy over
the first time.

16:39.827 --> 16:43.198
I tell you what.
Put a little whipped cream
on that old plastic wrap.

16:43.198 --> 16:45.700
.
Maybe you can steal
somethin' from a movie

16:45.700 --> 16:47.202
.
like lethal weapon

16:47.202 --> 16:50.205
man, those two guy
s loved each other.

16:50.205 --> 16:52.540
Yeah, I'll tell you something
I saw in a movie one time.

16:52.540 --> 16:55.376
See, this pig got loose
in this couple's house,

16:55.376 --> 16:57.212
and they chased it around

16:57.212 --> 16:59.130
until they fell
on top of each other,

16:59.130 --> 17:02.884
and they were
laughin' and gigglin' and...

17:03.851 --> 17:04.719
Lovin'.

17:14.695 --> 17:15.696
[sighs]

17:15.696 --> 17:17.065
ok.

17:17.065 --> 17:19.867
peggy, come out here
a minute, would you?

17:21.986 --> 17:24.821
Oops, oh my gosh!
You're about to step
in that rain puddle.

17:24.821 --> 17:26.907
That gives me an idea.

17:29.544 --> 17:32.914
Now you may pass unsoiled,
mademoiselle.

17:32.914 --> 17:35.216
Isn't that the jacket
that I made for you?

17:35.216 --> 17:37.885
You said that gangs
stole that jacket

17:38.386 --> 17:39.754
because it was
the wrong color.

17:40.221 --> 17:41.506
huh.

17:41.506 --> 17:45.009
If your lies were dollars,
I would have
a $100,000 by now

17:45.009 --> 17:46.928
and I would live
off the interest, hank.

17:46.928 --> 17:50.148
I'd still have to keep my job,
but things would
be a lot easier.

18:01.943 --> 18:03.244
Guess who?

18:03.661 --> 18:05.163
[screaming]

18:05.163 --> 18:07.415
.
oh, you have
gasoline on your hands

18:07.415 --> 18:09.834
yeah, I was cleaning
tar off the driveway.

18:09.834 --> 18:12.253
My eyes--
My eyes are burnin'.

18:12.253 --> 18:15.423
Hey, now that
you're splashin',
let's have a splash fight.

18:15.423 --> 18:17.425
?
Stop it.
What is wrong with you

18:17.425 --> 18:19.927
hey, where are you goin'?
It's fun.

18:20.428 --> 18:21.429
oh.

18:26.934 --> 18:28.770
(peggy)
oh, ooh!

18:28.770 --> 18:30.221
[snorting]

18:30.221 --> 18:31.806
what the hey?

18:31.806 --> 18:34.275
It's a little pig
in the house.

18:34.275 --> 18:37.195
Oh, this is crazy.
It's fun like in that movie.

18:37.195 --> 18:40.198
.
Let's chase it together.
I'll grab it
and you snatch the bow

18:40.698 --> 18:42.617
it'll be romantic.

18:42.617 --> 18:45.036
Come on, it's pig-chasing.

18:45.036 --> 18:48.456
(bobby)
mom, dad,
there's a pig in the house.

18:48.456 --> 18:51.576
Oh, peggy, I'm tryin'
to be romantic here.

18:51.576 --> 18:54.212
.
I just wanted
to make things right again

18:54.212 --> 18:56.331
for that, you would
need a time machine.

18:56.331 --> 18:58.416
And all you have is a pig.

18:58.916 --> 19:01.836
You can't just make up
a romantic story for us.

19:01.836 --> 19:04.005
The great ones
just happen naturally.

19:04.005 --> 19:05.673
And right now,

19:05.673 --> 19:08.176
neither of us knows
if one will
ever happen again.

19:08.559 --> 19:09.560
But, peggy...

19:09.844 --> 19:11.979
[pig squealing]
ah, ah! Ugh!

19:11.979 --> 19:14.232
[growling]

19:14.232 --> 19:15.733
my back.

19:15.733 --> 19:17.735
Congratulations, hank.

19:17.735 --> 19:20.104
You just ruined
one of my favorite movies.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.741
When's your date
going to get here?

19:24.242 --> 19:25.243
How should I know?

19:25.243 --> 19:27.245
I don't even know
for sure who she is,

19:27.662 --> 19:29.580
or if her leg is fully healed.

19:29.580 --> 19:30.581
Where should we hide?

19:30.581 --> 19:32.033
(bobby)
in the closet.

19:32.533 --> 19:35.036
And don't play wit
h the dry-cleaning bag,
you could suffocate.

19:35.036 --> 19:37.789
.
Hey, where's connie?
She'd want to see this

19:37.789 --> 19:39.540
I thought she'd be here.

19:39.540 --> 19:43.044
(luanne)
bobby, your secret
admirer is here.

19:46.380 --> 19:47.381
Grandma?

19:47.848 --> 19:49.683
Happy valentine's day,
boo-boo!

19:49.683 --> 19:51.469
no!

19:52.470 --> 19:53.354
[chuckling]

19:53.354 --> 19:55.356
.
your grandmother loves you

19:56.057 --> 19:57.858
[boggle cubes rattling]

19:57.858 --> 19:59.860
you cannot believe
what hank has put me through.

20:00.361 --> 20:02.363
I--I have never seen
a more pathetic series

20:02.363 --> 20:04.648
of unromantic,
childish stunts.

20:04.949 --> 20:05.950
Oh, shug.

20:06.450 --> 20:09.737
First, he thinks flowers
are going to make
everything better.

20:09.737 --> 20:11.238
.
They just don't get it

20:11.238 --> 20:12.456
typical. Flowers.

20:12.957 --> 20:15.459
e
Then, he actually drank
a whole bottle of champagn

20:15.960 --> 20:17.161
out of one of my pumps.

20:17.161 --> 20:19.663
My charcoal pads filtered out
most of the alcohol,

20:20.164 --> 20:22.917
but he still got tipsy enough
to sing a chuck mangione song.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.252
??[humming]

20:25.753 --> 20:26.504
that one?

20:26.504 --> 20:28.506
It is our song.

20:28.506 --> 20:31.342
Then he lets a rented pig
go in my house

20:31.342 --> 20:32.760
and he tries
to get me to chase it.

20:33.144 --> 20:35.513
Just like in that
famous movie, right?

20:35.513 --> 20:37.098
Uh-huh.

20:37.098 --> 20:41.102
And he ends up flat
on his back in bed,
on valentine's day,

20:41.102 --> 20:43.104
just like in high school.

20:43.104 --> 20:44.438
[sighing]

20:44.438 --> 20:46.907
you know, you could write
that story down,

20:46.907 --> 20:49.910
.
put fabio on the cover
and sell it at the airport

20:49.910 --> 20:52.947
that is one of
the sweetest stories.

20:53.948 --> 20:54.949
Nancy,

20:55.449 --> 20:56.450
could I--

20:56.450 --> 20:59.286
Could I borrow
your cell phone
for a moment?

21:01.205 --> 21:03.207
[ringing]

21:03.207 --> 21:04.425
[sighing]

21:05.009 --> 21:05.793
hello.

21:06.293 --> 21:08.596
(peggy)
hello, Mr. Hill.
This is Miss platter.

21:08.596 --> 21:09.930
oh.

21:09.930 --> 21:12.716
Well, good evenin'
, Miss platter.

21:12.716 --> 21:16.053
Uh, to what do I owe
the pleasure of this call?

21:16.053 --> 21:18.055
Well, I'm calling
to let you know

21:18.055 --> 21:19.940
that your dinner is ready.

21:19.940 --> 21:21.392
And, uh,

21:21.392 --> 21:23.360
what did you make for dinner?

21:23.360 --> 21:26.864
Well, I thought about it
and decided to make you

21:26.864 --> 21:28.782
beef wellington.

21:28.782 --> 21:30.618
Beef wellington, huh?

21:30.618 --> 21:32.403
How'd it turn out this time?

21:32.403 --> 21:35.739
Well, I'd have to say
it's pretty perfect.

21:35.739 --> 21:37.658
Of course it is,
that's your specialty.

21:38.159 --> 21:39.160
That's right.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.662
And I baked you a cherry pie

21:42.163 --> 21:44.465
with a golden-brown crust.

21:44.465 --> 21:47.168
Boy! I tell you what, peggy.
That's my favorite.

21:47.168 --> 21:48.335
Mmm-hmm.

22:01.482 --> 22:02.983
[dish shatters]

22:02.983 --> 22:04.485
(peggy)
mother, be careful.

22:04.985 --> 22:07.938
That woman in that movie
was 30 years younger than you.

22:10.441 --> 22:11.609
[pig squeals]

22:11.609 --> 22:14.111
(luanne)
stay outta here!
This is my room, you pig!

22:15.412 --> 22:19.166
A pig in the house
. It's crazy. It's fun.

22:19.166 --> 22:21.335
Come on, bobby
.

22:21.335 --> 22:23.954
(peggy)
mother, do not lift the pig.

22:23.954 --> 22:26.507
Keep the pig on the ground.

22:29.510 --> 22:32.346
(luanne)
am I supposed
to kill this pig?

22:33.305 --> 22:39.346
