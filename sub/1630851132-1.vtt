00:15.515 --> 00:17.175
- Jordan.

00:17.175 --> 00:18.510
Anybody have a signal?

00:18.510 --> 00:20.010
- Toni we're in the middle of a maze.

00:20.010 --> 00:22.200
- I can see the exit from here.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.610
- It is kinda lame.

00:34.557 --> 00:35.890
- What was that?

00:44.161 --> 00:45.341
- Really?

00:45.341 --> 00:48.539
- Last one out's a rotten turd!

00:48.539 --> 00:50.706
- How very unfunny of you.

01:19.700 --> 01:20.533
Hello?

01:40.213 --> 01:41.770
Stop it Rory.

01:41.770 --> 01:44.420
I'll smack you so hard, your
will break.

01:51.132 --> 01:51.965
- Toni?

01:53.121 --> 01:54.830
- You guys pissed her off.

01:54.830 --> 01:57.320
- I'm glad she drove herself.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.013
All she does is creep people.

02:00.020 --> 02:03.853
- Ladies, did you happen
to see my friend Otis?

02:05.700 --> 02:06.703
Scar across here?

02:08.420 --> 02:09.573
Seven feet tall.

02:13.990 --> 02:16.520
- Past the werewolf who is
standing next to Count Dracula.

02:16.520 --> 02:18.060
- You're not very scary.

02:18.060 --> 02:19.430
- Lamest maze ever.

02:19.430 --> 02:20.943
We should get our money back.

02:32.795 --> 02:33.628
- No.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.492
No, don't.

02:42.218 --> 02:43.051
No no.

03:16.710 --> 03:19.220
- Excellent specimen, Otis.

03:19.220 --> 03:21.730
Let's not damage her skin.

03:21.730 --> 03:23.893
You did it in the wrong order again.

03:25.350 --> 03:27.220
Excuse my friend,

03:27.220 --> 03:29.970
his incompetence will
some day be his undoing.

03:39.395 --> 03:40.228
- No.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.750
- This may sting a bit.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.963
It appears your friends
have abandoned you.

04:03.850 --> 04:06.273
Tossed you aside like a raggedy doll.

04:08.348 --> 04:09.560
But don't fret.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.083
Their loss is our gain.

04:12.440 --> 04:14.207
You're simply a canvas now

04:14.207 --> 04:16.823
but I will mold you into a work of art.

04:17.820 --> 04:19.270
You'll be one for the ages.

04:27.742 --> 04:28.575
- No, no.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.770
- Ladies and gentlemen,
if you look to your right,

05:06.770 --> 05:08.640
you will find corn.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.993
To your left, more corn.

05:12.430 --> 05:13.273
Ugly corn.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.020
- I think cornfields are beautiful.

05:16.020 --> 05:17.550
- Oh, you would.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.300
Oh hey, is that your new boyfriend?

05:27.460 --> 05:29.100
- Looks sharp.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.720
- Oh, yeah.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.128
Yeah, it was my dad's.

05:33.128 --> 05:35.378
He said it could cut a
bear's claw clean off.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.190
- Sorry.

05:38.190 --> 05:39.810
- About my dad? Don't be.

05:39.810 --> 05:42.433
I'm sure he wasn't when he
left us without even a note.

05:44.040 --> 05:44.873
- Dick move.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.730
Getting a headstart on nursing?

05:51.650 --> 05:52.500
- Medical school.

05:53.540 --> 05:54.523
- Doctor Tia, huh?

05:55.920 --> 05:57.170
- What's wrong with that?

05:58.200 --> 05:59.590
- Nothing.

05:59.590 --> 06:02.050
Your mom was a nurse when we met.

06:02.050 --> 06:03.390
- Well, that's news to me,

06:03.390 --> 06:05.650
because she told me that
dad introduced you guys.

06:05.650 --> 06:07.283
- What? No.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.270
I never met your pop.

06:09.270 --> 06:11.333
But she waited on me in the ER.

06:12.510 --> 06:15.463
- Well, she saved his
life and stole his heart.

06:16.430 --> 06:18.130
- That she did.

06:18.130 --> 06:20.000
Definitely felt sorry for moi.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.663
- Nursing is noble.

06:22.890 --> 06:25.350
- I'll tell you what's noble, farmers.

06:25.350 --> 06:26.393
They feed the world.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.090
And guess who sells them the seeds?

06:30.090 --> 06:31.350
- Yeah, that's great for you,

06:31.350 --> 06:34.652
but I actually want to make
an impact on the world,

06:34.652 --> 06:35.970
and cure diseases.

06:35.970 --> 06:37.690
- Yes Tia, we know.

06:37.690 --> 06:38.840
- Know what?

06:38.840 --> 06:40.010
That mom's a liar,

06:40.010 --> 06:41.120
that dad's a dick,

06:41.120 --> 06:42.790
that I will soon be a doctor?

06:42.790 --> 06:43.920
- We never said that.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.120
Be what you want, don't care.

06:45.120 --> 06:45.953
- Yeah, I know.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.750
- Now over there we got some corn,

06:54.750 --> 06:55.980
and over there we got-

06:55.980 --> 06:56.813
- Some wheat?

06:56.813 --> 06:57.646
- Nope.

06:57.646 --> 06:58.479
Soy beans.

07:02.970 --> 07:04.917
- I'm never gonna take his place, Tia.

07:04.917 --> 07:06.590
But your mom chose me.

07:06.590 --> 07:07.590
- We didn't.

07:07.590 --> 07:08.540
- Damn, Tia.

07:08.540 --> 07:09.373
- Really?

07:11.200 --> 07:12.400
- It's only been a year.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.200
- Damn it.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.250
- What's that?

07:20.250 --> 07:21.633
- Damn it, flat tire.

07:28.630 --> 07:29.673
I got it.
- Yeah?

07:46.630 --> 07:47.830
- How many bars you got?

07:50.420 --> 07:51.253
- Zero.

07:55.660 --> 07:57.190
- Tia, help!

07:57.190 --> 07:59.303
- Sorry, I don't scare so easily.

08:05.030 --> 08:08.363
- Hey, why did the
scarecrow get a promotion?

08:10.239 --> 08:11.500
- I don't know.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.600
- Because he was outstanding in his field.

08:14.490 --> 08:15.323
- Please stop.

08:23.030 --> 08:24.820
- Spare tire looks bad.

08:24.820 --> 08:27.360
Just sheds up there, but
there's a farmhouse back there.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.950
Maybe the farmer has a patch.

08:28.950 --> 08:31.100
- All right, don't go
talking shop forever.

08:34.950 --> 08:37.073
- You let mom marry a corn seed salesman.

08:42.160 --> 08:43.083
- You agreed to.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.120
Okay?

08:51.120 --> 08:52.070
He makes her happy.

08:59.010 --> 08:59.843
Tia,

09:02.149 --> 09:05.630
What did the scarecrow
name his self-portrait?

09:08.890 --> 09:09.933
Stick life.

09:12.190 --> 09:13.930
- Are you sure we're related?

09:13.930 --> 09:15.560
- No one's home.

09:15.560 --> 09:16.930
What?

09:16.930 --> 09:18.280
- She doesn't scare easily?

09:20.020 --> 09:22.050
- I'm gonna miss my next appointment.

09:22.050 --> 09:24.650
Hey, you guys want to walk
with me to the next town?

09:26.670 --> 09:27.503
- I'm good.

09:29.230 --> 09:30.180
- All right.

09:30.180 --> 09:31.650
All right, there are blankets back there.

09:31.650 --> 09:32.483
All right?

09:32.483 --> 09:33.316
- Blankets.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.180
How long are you planning on being gone?

09:36.180 --> 09:37.490
- I don't know, but
your mom's gonna kill me

09:37.490 --> 09:38.890
if anything happens to you two.

09:38.890 --> 09:40.543
So don't leave the area, okay?

09:42.010 --> 09:43.063
Okay?
- Okay.

09:44.050 --> 09:44.883
- All right.

09:49.020 --> 09:49.853
Tia?

09:54.260 --> 09:55.093
Thank you.

09:56.340 --> 09:57.821
Love you.

09:57.821 --> 09:58.654
- Love you too.

10:01.810 --> 10:02.883
He said it first.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.910
He's going through a hard time.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.323
I'm being nice to him,

10:09.310 --> 10:10.560
something you should try.

10:11.770 --> 10:14.220
- Easy for you, you leave
for college in a month.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.003
Jesus Christ, Don.

10:31.960 --> 10:32.793
Come on.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.660
- What are scarecrows made of?

10:47.550 --> 10:50.203
- Straw, wood, cloth,

10:51.780 --> 10:54.559
wrapped in the dried tendons
and bowels of a dead witch.

10:54.559 --> 10:55.392
- Stop.

11:14.660 --> 11:17.270
- Saw something, some movement back there.

11:17.270 --> 11:19.500
- Well, he said to stay here.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.300
- I'm not sleeping in the car again.

11:22.370 --> 11:23.870
- You slept in the car before?

11:35.830 --> 11:36.663
- Stop.

11:38.880 --> 11:39.713
Stop.

11:44.850 --> 11:47.150
- Hey, what did the
scarecrow have for dinner?

11:48.620 --> 11:49.840
- I don't know.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.270
Straw berries?

11:52.270 --> 11:53.610
- Ho ho ho.

11:53.610 --> 11:56.133
He was going to, but you
know, he was stuffed.

12:18.252 --> 12:19.489
- That was creepy.

12:23.320 --> 12:24.920
I told you I don't scare easily.

12:43.389 --> 12:44.703
- Don't worry about it,
don't worry about it.

12:56.073 --> 12:57.480
- Thought you said you saw something?

12:57.480 --> 12:58.313
- Thought I did.

13:00.460 --> 13:01.293
Hello?

13:05.130 --> 13:06.890
- You're trespassing.

13:06.890 --> 13:09.053
- Oh, hi.

13:13.297 --> 13:14.147
You got me there.

13:15.322 --> 13:17.522
We were wondering if
we could get some help.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.110
Our dad, he left for town

13:22.622 --> 13:24.443
a few hours ago.

13:24.443 --> 13:25.276
- He's dad, now?

13:27.730 --> 13:29.143
- We have a flat.
- I saw.

13:30.950 --> 13:32.050
Come in, have a drink.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.623
- Not menacing at all.

13:38.890 --> 13:39.990
Into the spooky house?

13:41.620 --> 13:42.813
Into the spooky house.

14:02.680 --> 14:05.580
- Oh hey hey, get your hands off her.

14:05.580 --> 14:06.430
What's the problem?

14:06.430 --> 14:07.263
- She fell.

14:14.700 --> 14:15.533
Taxidermy.

14:18.030 --> 14:19.140
- Huh?

14:19.140 --> 14:20.623
- He stuffs animals.

14:22.270 --> 14:24.030
- On purpose?

14:24.030 --> 14:24.863
- It's a hobby.

14:28.800 --> 14:29.650
- You shoot that?

14:30.670 --> 14:31.653
- Some farmer did.

14:32.760 --> 14:35.847
- Crows, Tia, should dissect, huh?

14:39.820 --> 14:41.373
- I want to be a doctor.

14:43.460 --> 14:46.770
- There's nothing much to
dissect here, it's stuffed.

14:46.770 --> 14:47.603
- With what?

14:48.740 --> 14:50.840
- Taxidermists never reveal their methods.

14:53.110 --> 14:55.160
You guys are welcome to hang if you want.

14:59.624 --> 15:01.961
- Oh, it got my ear, it got my ear.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.250
- Why are you guys hiding it?

15:16.490 --> 15:17.540
- It's a tool shed.

15:17.540 --> 15:20.410
- Well, are we gonna
take the tire somewhere?

15:20.410 --> 15:22.073
- How? I don't have a car.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.823
- So what, we're staying here?

15:31.410 --> 15:34.363
- So there is a party going
on not too far from here.

15:37.334 --> 15:38.630
- And what if Don comes back?

15:38.630 --> 15:40.730
- Oh, come on, you've been dying to party.

15:42.850 --> 15:44.040
- You could leave a note.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.113
- Can leave a note.

15:46.090 --> 15:46.923
- I guess.

15:48.330 --> 15:49.313
- Yes.

15:52.470 --> 15:53.303
- This way.

16:58.482 --> 16:59.960
- I have no reception.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.240
Maybe we should just stay here.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.450
- Look, I'm sure Don went
to his meeting early,

17:04.450 --> 17:06.090
and they put them up for the night.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.440
I don't know, you know him.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.440
- No, I don't know him.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.273
- What's that?

17:11.850 --> 17:14.200
- I don't know, it dripped
from your scarecrow.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.353
- Not mine.

17:17.935 --> 17:19.270
It's blood.

17:19.270 --> 17:20.103
- Cary.

17:23.561 --> 17:25.410
No no no, that's my last one.

17:25.410 --> 17:26.760
Was your last one.

17:29.033 --> 17:30.333
- No thanks, I'm good.

17:39.230 --> 17:40.513
- Something's going on.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.920
- We might be a little early.

17:45.753 --> 17:46.633
- Whose party is this?

17:48.200 --> 17:51.040
- Different people have them.

18:02.660 --> 18:03.510
- So where is it?

18:07.130 --> 18:08.380
- They might've moved it.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.003
- So where was it?

18:20.020 --> 18:21.180
- Can we just go back?

18:21.180 --> 18:22.013
I'm tired.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.583
- Only Mister Sunshine knows the way back.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.803
- Simon Callaway.

19:00.474 --> 19:02.057
You know the drill.

19:04.220 --> 19:05.863
When I told you to leave town,

19:07.040 --> 19:09.260
it wasn't a request.

19:09.260 --> 19:10.803
Where are you squatting now?

19:12.400 --> 19:14.990
- I'm legal, it's under four inches.

19:14.990 --> 19:16.740
- Is that what you tell the ladies?

19:20.590 --> 19:21.530
Where's the party at?

19:21.530 --> 19:23.970
- Do I look like the
social center of Westville?

19:23.970 --> 19:26.543
- Son, you leave me no choice.

19:28.030 --> 19:29.600
Excuse me?

19:29.600 --> 19:32.650
- Hey, never sneak up on
an officer of the law.

19:32.650 --> 19:33.820
- What'd he do?

19:33.820 --> 19:35.650
- I'll ask the questions here.

19:35.650 --> 19:36.750
How do you know Simon?

19:37.650 --> 19:38.550
- He's our cousin.

19:39.820 --> 19:41.450
- Well that must make you squatter-dee,

19:41.450 --> 19:43.923
and hell, you're squatter-dum.

19:47.290 --> 19:49.260
- Well, we were, we were going,

19:49.260 --> 19:50.500
he was taking us to the next town.

19:50.500 --> 19:54.120
We were trying to meet
back up with our dad.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.910
- Taking you how? It's nine miles.

19:56.910 --> 19:57.970
Let's see some IDs.

19:57.970 --> 20:00.213
I don't believe this cousin bullshit.

20:02.030 --> 20:03.580
Don't you take that picture.

20:03.580 --> 20:04.960
- What's your badge number?

20:04.960 --> 20:06.530
Our mom is a federal judge,

20:06.530 --> 20:09.000
and she's gonna want to know
what we're being charged with.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.280
- No one's being charged here.

20:12.280 --> 20:13.470
- Okay, so then we're good to go.

20:13.470 --> 20:14.303
Come on Simon.

20:19.850 --> 20:22.220
- If I find out you all lied to me,

20:22.220 --> 20:23.420
there'll be hell to pay.

20:29.130 --> 20:30.493
- There's no reception.

20:31.490 --> 20:32.940
- Your mom's a federal judge?

20:34.070 --> 20:34.903
- Cary!

20:34.903 --> 20:36.080
- What the hell, man?

20:36.080 --> 20:38.650
He's lying to us, did you hear the deputy?

20:38.650 --> 20:40.400
He doesn't even live in that house.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.090
Just a squatter, huh?

20:43.940 --> 20:45.860
- The house was abandoned, so I moved in.

20:45.860 --> 20:47.270
I don't know where the owners are.

20:47.270 --> 20:48.450
They're probably in Florida

20:48.450 --> 20:50.200
or in a nursing home, I don't know.

20:52.150 --> 20:53.703
I had nowhere else to go.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.240
- And end up on a milk carton.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.730
- They change location every
night to avoid the deputies.

21:18.640 --> 21:19.640
Cary, don't.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.253
- I do whatever I'm not supposed to do.

21:30.090 --> 21:32.314
- Stop, you're gonna get us in trouble.

21:32.314 --> 21:33.410
- How?

21:33.410 --> 21:34.960
Everyone'll think Simon did it.

21:37.747 --> 21:39.580
I gotta pee.

22:05.405 --> 22:06.353
- Hi.

22:06.353 --> 22:08.770
- Who are you supposed to be?

22:10.422 --> 22:13.422
- I'm an alien disguised as a human.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.160
- We should have dressed up.

22:23.160 --> 22:24.210
- You're not already?

22:35.469 --> 22:38.380
- Oh shit.

22:38.380 --> 22:39.830
- Who are you supposed to be?

22:41.260 --> 22:43.393
- I know, Edward.

22:46.020 --> 22:46.970
- Give me knuckles.

22:51.772 --> 22:54.990
You wanna play, you gotta pay.

22:54.990 --> 22:56.020
- Hey, how are you doing?

22:56.020 --> 22:57.870
Cary, nice to meet you.

22:57.870 --> 23:01.560
Simon says your parties
are just the litest.

23:01.560 --> 23:02.393
- Simon?

23:03.260 --> 23:04.093
- Yeah.

23:05.530 --> 23:06.580
- Stay clear of Dede.

23:14.940 --> 23:15.773
I'm Thor.

23:17.700 --> 23:18.533
- Awesome.

23:22.089 --> 23:23.313
- Watch out for the vampires.

23:36.357 --> 23:37.190
Edward?

23:39.085 --> 23:39.918
Edward?

23:43.607 --> 23:44.440
Simon.

23:47.416 --> 23:49.120
I think you'd better leave.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.380
Dawn's coming soon.

24:02.882 --> 24:04.215
- Never met you.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.120
- Tia.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.643
We're Simon's relation.

24:09.610 --> 24:14.000
- We're distant cousins by marriage.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.350
Twice-removed, hi I'm Cary.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.180
- Hey, when are you going?

24:20.180 --> 24:21.550
- Take a sit, bitch.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.740
Hi, Simon.

24:32.740 --> 24:34.140
Can I ask you a small favor?

24:44.642 --> 24:46.975
- Way to run that hay ride.

24:52.580 --> 24:54.970
- Your cousin's such a good driver.

24:54.970 --> 24:56.947
- Well, he's the sober one.

25:04.190 --> 25:05.863
- Is she your ex?

25:05.863 --> 25:07.330
Dede?

25:07.330 --> 25:08.343
- What, no.

25:11.730 --> 25:13.050
- Let's do the corn maze.

25:13.050 --> 25:16.070
- There's no way, this place is haunted.

25:16.070 --> 25:16.903
- You're lying.

25:27.380 --> 25:28.803
- Why are you so not drunk?

26:00.511 --> 26:02.261
Got incoming.

26:10.915 --> 26:12.748
- What are you doing?

26:14.413 --> 26:15.503
- Tia, come with me.

26:20.530 --> 26:22.527
- Bye, vampire.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.233
- Simon?

26:25.233 --> 26:26.066
- Let him go.

26:31.910 --> 26:32.743
- Let's go.

26:33.749 --> 26:37.989
- Come on, come on.

26:37.989 --> 26:39.239
- Drive, drive.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.153
- I have your truck.

27:12.670 --> 27:13.503
- Thank you.

27:17.697 --> 27:19.030
It's five dollars to get in.

27:19.030 --> 27:19.863
No way!

27:29.556 --> 27:31.588
- All right, it's free today.

27:34.300 --> 27:35.953
- Hey hey, maybe we should,

27:35.953 --> 27:37.510
maybe we should turn back.

27:37.510 --> 27:39.573
- Soon, just a second.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.130
- There are two of you,

28:30.130 --> 28:31.253
then you're near fire,

28:32.260 --> 28:33.110
and you're scary.

28:55.747 --> 28:57.201
- Where are you going?

28:57.201 --> 28:58.034
To get the keg.

28:58.034 --> 28:58.950
- She took our cups.

28:58.950 --> 29:00.660
- Her cups have holes in them.

29:22.130 --> 29:24.073
- I hate when you guys single me out.

29:32.870 --> 29:33.883
Not scary.

29:37.040 --> 29:37.873
No touching.

29:49.102 --> 29:50.435
- There you go.

29:51.510 --> 29:53.062
That's good though.

29:53.062 --> 29:53.979
Real good.

29:57.153 --> 29:59.320
I think I'm drunk.

30:02.458 --> 30:04.843
- Yeah you know I'm
actually, I'm ready to go.

30:06.170 --> 30:07.907
- Let's head back to the truck.

30:14.255 --> 30:17.672
- You know what, actually, I am going to,

30:19.655 --> 30:20.488
I'll catch up.

30:52.620 --> 30:53.787
Hey.

30:54.846 --> 30:55.870
- I'm fine.

30:55.870 --> 30:57.080
- You need to come with me.

30:57.080 --> 30:57.930
- Leave me alone.

31:00.690 --> 31:04.067
- Tia, you think those
girls give a shit about you?

32:33.175 --> 32:34.008
- Cary?

32:37.910 --> 32:38.743
- Okay.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.143
So you slept in Simon's room?

32:44.130 --> 32:44.963
- I guess.

32:47.410 --> 32:48.760
Thanks for getting me back.

32:50.290 --> 32:51.123
- Hmm?

32:53.030 --> 32:55.623
No, I don't even remember how I got here.

32:56.700 --> 32:57.937
- Stop messing around.

33:05.320 --> 33:06.203
- Son of a bitch.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.854
- Hey, you guys know how to make coffee?

33:11.854 --> 33:12.716
What the hell is wrong with you?

33:12.716 --> 33:13.593
- How did you get her clothes off?

33:13.593 --> 33:14.426
- What the hell are you doing?

33:14.426 --> 33:15.635
- How did she get her clothes off?

33:15.635 --> 33:16.780
- I don't know.

33:16.780 --> 33:17.613
How to should I know?

33:17.613 --> 33:18.550
I slept on the couch.

33:18.550 --> 33:20.200
You guys were totaled last night.

33:25.490 --> 33:26.363
You're welcome.

33:54.116 --> 33:57.840
- So, Dark Shadows over
here made you some eggs.

33:57.840 --> 33:58.763
- Thanks, Simon.

34:05.535 --> 34:07.702
- Are you gonna eat those?

34:15.713 --> 34:17.305
- I had a really weird dream.

34:17.305 --> 34:18.138
- Yeah?

34:21.953 --> 34:23.650
- You don't like him.

34:23.650 --> 34:25.190
- He's a freak.

34:25.190 --> 34:27.353
I'm 99% sure he's a vampire.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.900
Dede said she's never
seen him in the daylight.

34:30.900 --> 34:32.630
- Okay, about Dede,

34:32.630 --> 34:34.530
are you trying to get your ass kicked?

34:36.180 --> 34:37.390
- Watch this.

34:37.390 --> 34:38.223
Hey Simon,

34:45.640 --> 34:47.800
Dede invited us over to
swim at her place today,

34:47.800 --> 34:49.370
you want to come?

34:49.370 --> 34:51.470
- You guys go on ahead, I got a lot to do.

34:55.563 --> 34:57.813
- Do you think he sparkles?

35:02.110 --> 35:04.673
- It's cutaneous porphyria, right?

35:05.515 --> 35:07.040
- The sun makes me sick.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.420
Yeah.

35:08.420 --> 35:11.343
This is about all the
light that I can handle.

35:15.470 --> 35:17.480
- Yes on disease.

35:17.480 --> 35:18.360
- He's a vampire.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.610
- You scream like a baby.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.773
- Hey, have you seen Hailey?

36:19.690 --> 36:20.783
- Not since last night.

36:21.710 --> 36:22.910
- You mean this morning.

36:24.830 --> 36:25.663
- Yeah.

36:28.550 --> 36:30.223
- Shit, did we tie one on?

36:32.160 --> 36:33.823
Gotta save some for Halloween.

36:35.540 --> 36:36.630
- That's tonight.

36:38.465 --> 36:39.465
- Oh my God.

36:59.078 --> 37:00.550
- You okay?

37:01.737 --> 37:02.570
- You okay?

37:04.030 --> 37:05.497
- I can't hold my breath.

37:09.240 --> 37:11.210
- We let you hang,

37:11.210 --> 37:12.960
now you're trying to steal my girl?

37:15.184 --> 37:17.530
- Okay, but I'm not with Simon.

37:17.530 --> 37:19.560
- This is mine bitch, got it?

37:22.675 --> 37:23.925
- Okay, got it.

37:30.963 --> 37:31.796
I'm gonna head out.

37:31.796 --> 37:33.093
- Really, so soon?

37:37.442 --> 37:38.373
Should I take my towel?

37:45.120 --> 37:48.423
- I saw a girl being
carried away from the maze.

37:50.224 --> 37:53.890
- Okay, yeah, that's part of
the thing, it's to scare you.

37:53.890 --> 37:56.623
- No, it was really far from the maze.

37:59.220 --> 38:00.870
Have you heard anything from Don?

38:01.770 --> 38:04.465
- No, every time I get a bar I lose it.

38:04.465 --> 38:05.765
- What if he just left us?

38:06.979 --> 38:08.312
- Wait, shh shh.

38:11.583 --> 38:14.880
Parents say she hasn't been home.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.730
You bury her out back?

38:16.730 --> 38:18.130
- No, dumb ass.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.180
- Don't make me break your freaking neck.

38:31.090 --> 38:33.620
You should've seen their
faces when I came back.

38:33.620 --> 38:35.770
- I thought they would've
left you the keg.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.030
- I'll confiscate the next one.

38:42.140 --> 38:42.973
Say,

38:45.460 --> 38:48.220
you need any help with that little hottie,

38:48.220 --> 38:49.680
call me.

38:49.680 --> 38:50.610
Whatever.

38:50.610 --> 38:51.443
Yeah.

39:10.310 --> 39:12.260
How long have you guys been here?

39:12.260 --> 39:13.093
- Long enough.

39:15.106 --> 39:16.356
- What's the deal, Simon?

39:17.290 --> 39:18.563
- We're friends.

39:19.741 --> 39:21.380
He thinks it's funny to mess with people.

39:21.380 --> 39:23.963
- Oh, we're not people.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.263
Come on, I know where the party is.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.780
- Is there nothing real about you?

39:36.920 --> 39:37.753
- Sorry.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.203
It's just nice having people around.

39:56.903 --> 39:58.231
It's all I've got.

39:58.231 --> 39:59.420
You look great.

39:59.420 --> 40:00.443
Don't say that.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.930
What do I say if your dad comes?

40:02.930 --> 40:03.770
- Stepdad.

40:03.770 --> 40:05.682
- You tell him it's Halloween.

40:05.682 --> 40:06.950
We went out.

40:06.950 --> 40:08.300
Who doesn't love Halloween?

40:09.670 --> 40:11.800
You guys should
really have an escort.

40:11.800 --> 40:12.983
- No, we're good.

40:15.672 --> 40:17.193
- I'm not gonna save you again.

40:26.210 --> 40:27.610
I'm lost.

40:27.610 --> 40:29.210
- Should ask him for directions.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.020
- There's so many of them.

40:35.020 --> 40:36.910
Hey, why did the shy farmer

40:36.910 --> 40:38.760
make his girlfriend into a scarecrow?

40:39.700 --> 40:42.334
He knew she'd always hang around.

40:42.334 --> 40:47.334
- Shh.

40:47.353 --> 40:51.030
- Well hey, you know if there's
one thing farmers do well,

40:51.030 --> 40:52.183
it's hay rack rides.

40:53.930 --> 40:55.122
Race ya.

40:55.122 --> 40:55.955
- Wait!

40:59.850 --> 41:00.683
- Hi.

41:05.705 --> 41:07.205
How are you doing?

41:10.518 --> 41:11.924
- Boo!

41:11.924 --> 41:13.070
I'm a scarecrow.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.170
Yes, you are.

41:18.890 --> 41:20.590
You look like you've seen a ghost.

41:28.233 --> 41:30.623
Dede said the house
was near the corn maze.

41:31.650 --> 41:32.910
- There's another one down there.

41:32.910 --> 41:33.743
Are you sure?

41:35.130 --> 41:36.233
- Yeah, come on.

41:37.430 --> 41:38.263
- Wait.

41:50.850 --> 41:52.500
Cary, I think it's the other way.

42:01.790 --> 42:02.890
- Hi.

42:02.890 --> 42:04.107
This where you go in?

42:06.117 --> 42:07.433
Okay.

42:07.433 --> 42:08.743
This is a lot.

42:09.930 --> 42:11.150
Wow.

42:11.150 --> 42:13.190
Dude, that's a great get-up.

42:13.190 --> 42:14.023
Dede invited me,

42:14.023 --> 42:16.370
So I'm just gonna, scooch in.

42:18.610 --> 42:20.013
Hi, hello sir.

42:21.043 --> 42:22.373
I'll do a little under-breast.

42:23.920 --> 42:25.593
An older crowd than I expected.

42:30.920 --> 42:32.663
Oh, okay.

42:33.660 --> 42:34.813
Hello ladies.

42:40.380 --> 42:41.583
- Isn't she beautiful.

42:43.390 --> 42:44.873
Breathtaking work.

42:52.830 --> 42:53.770
- Hailey?

42:53.770 --> 42:55.884
Well, so good to see a familiar face here.

42:55.884 --> 42:57.290
I was starting to think
it was at the wrong party.

42:57.290 --> 42:59.873
You look great, spooky.

43:00.920 --> 43:03.393
So is this like a haunted house situation?

43:07.990 --> 43:10.183
- Hi, I'm Beatrice.

43:11.950 --> 43:13.140
- Tia.

43:13.140 --> 43:14.240
- People call me Beat.

43:15.480 --> 43:16.883
Are you one of the artists?

43:18.450 --> 43:19.800
- What do you mean, artist?

43:22.300 --> 43:23.550
- You should probably go.

43:32.350 --> 43:34.433
- We should go hang out after this.

43:37.550 --> 43:39.350
All right, well you're in character.

43:42.156 --> 43:43.206
I won't distract you.

43:53.180 --> 43:54.283
Excuse me, sorry.

43:55.372 --> 43:56.872
I'm just gonna go.

44:00.820 --> 44:02.313
- Leaving so soon?

44:03.530 --> 44:04.930
Damn Cary, hurry up.

44:09.993 --> 44:11.493
It's an outhouse.

44:23.491 --> 44:25.203
- I was actually just,

44:25.203 --> 44:26.500
I'm looking for the restroom.

44:26.500 --> 44:27.333
- To your left.

44:29.443 --> 44:30.276
- That one?

44:30.276 --> 44:31.468
- Mm-hmm.

44:31.468 --> 44:35.812
- Okay.

44:35.812 --> 44:40.812
- Help.

44:44.329 --> 44:45.162
- Oh God.

45:46.150 --> 45:49.693
- The positioning of the points
is of the utmost importance.

45:51.760 --> 45:54.660
Insert where the musculocutaneous nerve

45:54.660 --> 45:56.480
meets the spinal cord.

45:56.480 --> 45:59.170
Otherwise your specimen has movement,

45:59.170 --> 46:01.660
and this will delay the procedure.

46:01.660 --> 46:04.313
You want them to still be
breathing at this point.

46:08.580 --> 46:09.413
- Well.

46:10.590 --> 46:11.840
- The best part's coming.

46:15.990 --> 46:18.490
- And that is how you
achieve instant tetraplegia.

46:19.570 --> 46:20.863
Nice work Reinaldo.

46:28.828 --> 46:32.020
- This is unreal.

46:32.020 --> 46:34.863
Really, well done.

46:51.780 --> 46:54.850
- Straw seems to be the
perfect drying agent.

46:54.850 --> 46:56.825
One of the reasons we came to the Midwest

46:56.825 --> 47:00.172
is because they're so goddamn much of it.

47:02.650 --> 47:04.903
Who doesn't love scarecrows?

47:07.240 --> 47:11.230
Now artists like Reinaldo like
to waste no time digging in

47:11.230 --> 47:13.263
while the subject is still warm.

47:14.760 --> 47:16.080
Without blood flow,

47:16.080 --> 47:18.860
human skin has a narrow shelf life.

47:18.860 --> 47:22.150
So the drying agent must
be applied immediately.

47:22.150 --> 47:27.150
That gives the artist the
most soft and realistic skin.

47:27.740 --> 47:29.760
- When was the video made?

47:29.760 --> 47:31.563
- Earlier this afternoon, I believe.

47:33.050 --> 47:34.403
- There's been a lot of debate about

47:34.403 --> 47:36.713
what the subject actually feels.

47:38.650 --> 47:42.223
Frozen terror is what the eyes tell us.

47:43.230 --> 47:46.563
Acceptance soon takes the place of denial.

47:47.530 --> 47:49.730
Pockets of blood remain in the body,

47:49.730 --> 47:52.620
but the clock is ticking to drain the body

47:52.620 --> 47:54.120
of all perishables,

47:54.120 --> 47:56.193
to be replaced by stiffness.

47:57.390 --> 47:59.823
Most artists, they prefer
to keep the skeleton,

48:01.830 --> 48:03.773
and replace everything else.

48:13.893 --> 48:16.310
- Oh, I must have slipped.

48:16.310 --> 48:21.310
- Yes, apparently you
slipped into the wrong party.

48:23.130 --> 48:26.853
- Did you set his expression,
or did he die like that?

48:27.850 --> 48:29.573
- He died like that.

48:30.490 --> 48:34.460
In order to get the perfect expression,

48:34.460 --> 48:37.713
I use a single knife
thrust under the neck.

48:38.659 --> 48:40.740
- No, no, no, no.

48:40.740 --> 48:41.590
You're making a mistake.

48:41.590 --> 48:42.590
- I just heard that-

48:44.116 --> 48:46.990
- It gives the same
impression every single time,

48:46.990 --> 48:48.767
regardless of what you heard.

48:48.767 --> 48:50.373
- But it leaves a mark.

48:51.500 --> 48:55.123
- A mark that can be
covered by a skilled artist.

48:56.682 --> 49:01.682
- Help.

49:02.950 --> 49:03.783
- Tia?

49:05.107 --> 49:06.740
What are you doing?

49:06.740 --> 49:08.113
- Trying to pee, why?

49:10.390 --> 49:11.223
Simon!

49:14.580 --> 49:15.413
- Here.

49:16.970 --> 49:18.290
Grab a hold of this.

49:21.473 --> 49:22.713
- I can't, it's too high.

49:24.020 --> 49:24.877
.

49:29.220 --> 49:30.214
- What?

49:30.214 --> 49:32.881
- Really, I can't see anything.

49:33.750 --> 49:34.720
- Is this your phone?

49:34.720 --> 49:35.560
- Yes, drop it.

49:35.560 --> 49:36.790
- Is it waterproof?

49:36.790 --> 49:37.623
- Oh, come on.

49:40.617 --> 49:41.467
- Okay, I got it.

49:55.714 --> 49:56.710
Oh my God.

49:56.710 --> 49:57.543
- What?

49:57.543 --> 49:58.376
- The bottom is-

50:00.010 --> 50:00.843
- What is it?

50:04.260 --> 50:05.600
- Ray?

50:05.600 --> 50:06.863
- Ray is down there?

50:08.374 --> 50:10.374
- Oh my God, he's dead.

50:11.870 --> 50:13.483
- Tia, listen to me.

50:14.770 --> 50:15.733
This is a grave.

50:20.490 --> 50:23.593
Use his body to stand on and grab this.

50:33.146 --> 50:36.563
Oh no, I can't, I can't.

50:36.563 --> 50:37.954
What are you even doing here?

50:37.954 --> 50:39.010
How did you find me?

50:39.010 --> 50:39.970
- You're wasting time, okay?

50:39.970 --> 50:41.003
I'm here, aren't I?

50:42.890 --> 50:45.260
Put your phone down Tia,
and come up and grab this.

50:45.260 --> 50:48.380
- Still, I don't believe you.

50:48.380 --> 50:49.830
- You have to trust somebody.

51:12.370 --> 51:13.603
Shh shh, quiet.

51:19.060 --> 51:20.757
Throw him in the pit.

51:20.757 --> 51:22.270
Where you gonna throw him?

51:22.270 --> 51:24.343
So, it's deep enough.

51:24.343 --> 51:25.643
- Tia, you've gotta hurry.

51:31.370 --> 51:32.980
- Distractions aside,

51:32.980 --> 51:35.823
I'm looking forward to a
beautiful evening tonight.

51:36.740 --> 51:38.530
Quick housekeeping notes.

51:38.530 --> 51:41.090
Local law enforcement has been eliminated,

51:41.090 --> 51:44.320
and all traces of us will be disposed of.

51:44.320 --> 51:48.430
However, be sure to
clear the area by dawn.

51:48.430 --> 51:51.283
We don't want a satellite
picking up your license plates.

51:56.800 --> 51:59.870
Now, let's have a festive evening.

51:59.870 --> 52:01.880
Our defending speed champion

52:01.880 --> 52:03.943
has promised us the new record tonight.

52:09.540 --> 52:12.260
All right, first contest up.

52:12.260 --> 52:13.143
Recreation.

52:20.713 --> 52:21.546
- Ray?

52:22.684 --> 52:23.517
- Hi.

52:28.382 --> 52:29.882
Ray, are you okay?

52:31.533 --> 52:33.130
Where are we?

52:33.130 --> 52:36.570
- We're at a farm near
the maze, in an outhouse.

52:36.570 --> 52:37.693
- Ew, God.

52:40.810 --> 52:42.663
- Somebody grab the freaking hose.

52:44.730 --> 52:45.653
- What happened?

52:47.000 --> 52:48.423
- We were on the hayride.

52:49.650 --> 52:51.100
We must have been roofied.

52:55.070 --> 52:55.903
I need a bath.

53:06.700 --> 53:07.883
- Stop fighting.

53:15.650 --> 53:16.483
- Hello.

53:18.182 --> 53:19.015
Hey, how are you?

53:19.015 --> 53:19.897
Nice to see you.

53:22.976 --> 53:24.226
- It's locked.

53:30.020 --> 53:31.560
- Okay.

53:31.560 --> 53:34.390
Artists participating in recreation

53:34.390 --> 53:37.930
must use parts from at least
three different specimens.

53:37.930 --> 53:41.633
Now we have some very
interesting entries this year.

53:42.570 --> 53:44.313
Brie, if you will be so kind.

53:48.530 --> 53:50.190
Please score accordingly.

53:50.190 --> 53:52.933
Artists, maintain your anonymity.

53:56.360 --> 53:57.543
Otis, can you?

54:01.100 --> 54:02.283
Excuse me.

54:05.600 --> 54:08.893
Once a year, you have but
one task, containment.

54:22.984 --> 54:24.484
- He had a knife.

54:29.360 --> 54:31.003
- And I have a finger.

54:32.780 --> 54:34.643
You call yourselves professionals.

54:37.120 --> 54:39.020
- This door is locked from the inside.

54:41.120 --> 54:44.405
- Otis, fix this.

55:06.864 --> 55:10.864
Find him, catch the boy.

55:20.810 --> 55:21.643
- Cary!

55:21.643 --> 55:24.397
Hey, I've been looking
everywhere for you guys.

55:24.397 --> 55:25.230
- There's this cult, there's this cult.

55:25.230 --> 55:26.280
And they're killing people
and they're stuffing people.

55:26.280 --> 55:27.330
- Come on.

55:27.330 --> 55:28.163
- No, no, no.

55:28.163 --> 55:31.293
There's this cop that we met,
and I just, I saw him there.

55:31.293 --> 55:32.690
Just saw him get stuffed.

55:32.690 --> 55:34.480
This dude, they're doing
this thing tonight.

55:34.480 --> 55:35.313
I don't know what it is,

55:35.313 --> 55:38.500
but I kinda cut,

55:38.500 --> 55:39.843
I cut a few up and I ran.

55:40.860 --> 55:41.693
- Dear God.

55:43.420 --> 55:44.253
Where's Tia?

55:46.491 --> 55:47.880
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

55:47.880 --> 55:49.150
- You left your little sister?

55:49.150 --> 55:50.810
- No she was, she, she, she must've left.

55:50.810 --> 55:51.643
She must've, she went out.

55:51.643 --> 55:52.827
She went out.

55:52.827 --> 55:53.943
- That she would never leave your side.

55:55.100 --> 55:56.890
Okay, all right.

55:56.890 --> 55:58.150
Take my phone.

55:58.150 --> 55:59.380
I'm gonna show you the fastest way back,

55:59.380 --> 56:01.680
Dial 9-1-1 till you
get through, all right?

56:01.680 --> 56:03.070
Just follow this road straight down, go.

56:03.070 --> 56:04.406
- No, no, no.

56:04.406 --> 56:05.239
What, are you gonna fight 'em?

56:05.239 --> 56:06.310
You can't, you can't fight them.

56:06.310 --> 56:08.110
There's one that is seven feet tall.

56:11.510 --> 56:12.810
- I've got stopping power.

56:14.160 --> 56:14.993
- Wait,

56:15.870 --> 56:17.033
I'm coming with you,

56:18.510 --> 56:19.610
in case they have Tia.

56:21.370 --> 56:22.203
Please?

56:23.950 --> 56:25.050
- All right, let's go.

56:30.130 --> 56:31.680
- Hey, Frankenstein.

56:35.950 --> 56:37.610
- Otis, no.

56:37.610 --> 56:39.677
We can't lift your ass out of there.

56:58.353 --> 56:59.743
- Come on bitch, come on.

57:02.610 --> 57:03.443
The hell.

57:13.730 --> 57:15.253
- Don't ruin the specimen.

58:14.149 --> 58:16.670
- What are you doing?

58:16.670 --> 58:17.503
- Beat?

58:17.503 --> 58:19.380
- I've been watching you guys.

58:19.380 --> 58:22.820
- Please please, find
something to tie this on, okay?

58:22.820 --> 58:23.883
- Oh yeah, okay.

58:26.236 --> 58:27.069
Oh yeah.

58:39.741 --> 58:40.574
Okay.

58:50.837 --> 58:51.670
- Thanks.

58:51.670 --> 58:53.184
- You guys shouldn't be here.

58:53.184 --> 58:54.358
- Why?

58:54.358 --> 58:56.820
- If you aren't an artist or sponsor,

58:56.820 --> 58:57.860
you get stuffed.

59:04.316 --> 59:05.649
- Let's get 'em.

59:34.705 --> 59:36.703
- What are you doing?

59:36.703 --> 59:38.079
- I don't wanna die.

59:39.254 --> 59:40.347
I can't go under.

59:40.347 --> 59:43.597
- I'll hold you, just hold your breath.

1:01:17.190 --> 1:01:18.660
- The guys in the house,

1:01:18.660 --> 1:01:19.810
do they know about Tia?

1:01:20.991 --> 1:01:22.574
- I don't think so.

1:01:25.148 --> 1:01:27.398
- Maybe she's in that barn.

1:01:35.818 --> 1:01:36.651
- Beat?

1:02:26.847 --> 1:02:28.470
- Okay, shoot 'em.

1:02:28.470 --> 1:02:29.750
- Makes too much noise.

1:02:29.750 --> 1:02:31.220
It'll draw everyone's attention.

1:02:31.220 --> 1:02:32.053
Think son.

1:02:37.660 --> 1:02:40.160
- Up in the window, reveal yourself.

1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:41.300
- What's up?

1:02:41.300 --> 1:02:43.363
- Beat, you climb out again?

1:02:44.410 --> 1:02:47.050
- I needed some more fresh air, okay?

1:02:47.050 --> 1:02:48.230
- Don't get snarky.

1:02:48.230 --> 1:02:49.063
- I'm sorry.

1:02:53.500 --> 1:02:55.040
- It was Beat, she got out.

1:02:55.040 --> 1:02:56.730
And
have you located the boy?

1:02:56.730 --> 1:02:58.800
- Yes sir, we have the cornfield covered.

1:02:58.800 --> 1:02:59.943
He won't get far.

1:03:07.501 --> 1:03:09.090
- Let's go.

1:03:09.090 --> 1:03:09.923
- Wait, wait.

1:03:31.610 --> 1:03:32.610
- Who is it?

1:03:33.989 --> 1:03:36.656
- Some sort of prepper, I guess.

1:03:43.481 --> 1:03:44.504
- Try it out.

1:03:44.504 --> 1:03:45.838
- Yeah.

1:03:45.838 --> 1:03:47.108
Got you.

1:03:47.108 --> 1:03:48.380
I'll take the knife.

1:03:48.380 --> 1:03:49.930
Looks just like his.

1:04:11.092 --> 1:04:12.259
- I wouldn't.

1:04:15.410 --> 1:04:16.900
- My brother is downstairs.

1:04:16.900 --> 1:04:18.223
- Sucks for him.

1:04:20.910 --> 1:04:22.060
- Who are these people?

1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:27.653
- They promised they'd
leave after tonight.

1:04:29.870 --> 1:04:33.000
- Earlier you said, "artists."

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:33.853
What do you mean?

1:04:35.380 --> 1:04:37.980
- The speci- spec-.

1:04:37.980 --> 1:04:38.813
- Specimens?

1:04:41.690 --> 1:04:43.903
- Don't treat them very well at all.

1:04:45.790 --> 1:04:47.240
- Do they have your mom, too.

1:04:52.010 --> 1:04:52.893
- I peeked out.

1:04:53.749 --> 1:04:55.049
You can see them partying.

1:05:03.670 --> 1:05:05.253
- Why are there no photos of you?

1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:08.677
- I don't like my picture taken.

1:05:10.235 --> 1:05:11.153
- Is that your dad?

1:05:14.270 --> 1:05:15.573
- I think they killed him.

1:05:21.586 --> 1:05:24.530
- Beat, we have to get out of here.

1:05:24.530 --> 1:05:25.980
- Not me.

1:05:25.980 --> 1:05:27.123
I want to see my mom.

1:05:28.950 --> 1:05:31.203
You definitely should
not have followed me.

1:05:32.120 --> 1:05:32.953
Nope.

1:05:55.790 --> 1:05:56.763
- This is in their video.

1:06:05.877 --> 1:06:07.710
- Hurry, you imbecile.

1:06:11.966 --> 1:06:13.466
Dear God.

1:06:20.180 --> 1:06:22.860
- I'll take it from
here, I'm on a deadline.

1:06:22.860 --> 1:06:23.693
Move it.

1:06:28.216 --> 1:06:29.049
- Damn it.

1:07:00.373 --> 1:07:01.956
- What's she doing?

1:07:03.185 --> 1:07:04.352
I can't do it.

1:07:05.415 --> 1:07:07.498
- Hey, hold it together.

1:07:15.171 --> 1:07:16.838
- Oh, you scared me.

1:07:22.550 --> 1:07:27.503
- I've been told you were
a bad girl, Beatrice.

1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:32.950
Don't you want to see your mother?

1:07:32.950 --> 1:07:33.783
- Yes.

1:07:35.270 --> 1:07:36.667
What are you looking for?

1:07:38.590 --> 1:07:42.920
- No downstairs, no outside, no playmates,

1:07:42.920 --> 1:07:45.393
or no mommy, ever.

1:07:47.210 --> 1:07:48.223
Am I clear?

1:08:03.460 --> 1:08:06.960
- It's all right, he's
gone, he's gone now.

1:08:08.162 --> 1:08:09.094
It's all right.

1:08:09.094 --> 1:08:10.362
He'll leave soon.

1:08:10.362 --> 1:08:11.195
Right?

1:08:11.195 --> 1:08:12.657
I promise.

1:08:12.657 --> 1:08:13.490
You're gonna be all right.

1:08:13.490 --> 1:08:14.730
You're gonna be all right.

1:08:20.932 --> 1:08:22.230
- I did not like that guy.

1:08:22.230 --> 1:08:23.663
- He's head artist.

1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:35.080
- We need to go outside
and guard her window.

1:08:35.080 --> 1:08:36.160
- Outside?

1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:38.170
She's just a kid.

1:08:38.170 --> 1:08:41.103
- Mister Doctor wants
no more distractions.

1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:46.320
- We have to go now.

1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:47.410
- You go.

1:08:47.410 --> 1:08:48.243
He won't kill me.

1:08:48.243 --> 1:08:49.210
- How do you know that?

1:08:50.557 --> 1:08:53.433
- I'm not an ideal specimen.

1:08:58.610 --> 1:09:00.150
- I'll come back for you.

1:09:00.150 --> 1:09:01.290
Don't worry.

1:09:01.290 --> 1:09:03.333
- What, me worry?

1:09:23.042 --> 1:09:24.209
- There's Tia.

1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:42.677
I got this.

1:10:15.734 --> 1:10:18.993
- So, you like the
specimens from this area?

1:10:20.060 --> 1:10:23.510
- They do seem to have
the best choice of eyes.

1:10:23.510 --> 1:10:25.780
Eyes are the most difficult to master.

1:10:25.780 --> 1:10:27.543
They have to be harvested quickly.

1:10:28.530 --> 1:10:30.980
- I like to keep 'em on
ice until they're needed.

1:10:33.860 --> 1:10:34.963
- Excuse me.

1:10:38.020 --> 1:10:40.070
You continue to interrupt me

1:10:40.070 --> 1:10:42.343
on the one night a year
daddy needs to focus.

1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:45.290
- Why won't you let me see mommy?

1:10:49.210 --> 1:10:50.260
- It's time.

1:10:50.260 --> 1:10:52.226
- What time?

1:10:52.226 --> 1:10:53.710
- Time for you to grow up.

1:10:53.710 --> 1:10:55.553
- What, no daddy, no.

1:10:56.544 --> 1:10:57.377
Oh my God.

1:11:07.533 --> 1:11:08.898
- You just killed him.

1:11:08.898 --> 1:11:09.948
- Ain't got a choice.

1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:12.480
Get back in that crib cellar,

1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:14.457
I'll try and find a way in.

1:11:14.457 --> 1:11:17.226
- Is that right, split up, are you crazy?

1:11:17.226 --> 1:11:19.751
- What would you have me do?

1:11:26.610 --> 1:11:30.610
- Tia is out there right
now with those murderers.

1:11:30.610 --> 1:11:32.400
If my dad was here, he
would know what to do.

1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:34.115
- That's a low blow.

1:11:34.115 --> 1:11:35.330
I'm the one that's here, right?

1:11:35.330 --> 1:11:36.964
Right?

1:11:36.964 --> 1:11:38.293
Now get back in that crib
cellar,  okay.

1:11:45.320 --> 1:11:46.650
Two people are hard enough to hide,

1:11:46.650 --> 1:11:48.003
maybe one can be stealthy.

1:11:50.070 --> 1:11:51.413
All right, I'll try to
find a way and if I can't,

1:11:51.413 --> 1:11:53.190
I'll get the car and I'll bring help.

1:11:53.190 --> 1:11:54.990
Just stay in here where you're safe.

1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:10.500
- Mister Doctor, this a new specimen?

1:12:10.500 --> 1:12:12.773
- You're all acquainted with my daughter.

1:12:13.710 --> 1:12:17.830
It is time for Beatrice to learn
the family's trade secrets.

1:12:17.830 --> 1:12:19.390
- Secrets?

1:12:19.390 --> 1:12:22.820
Like how you keep Mommy and me
locked up, in separate rooms.

1:12:22.820 --> 1:12:23.653
- Hush.

1:12:25.550 --> 1:12:27.290
- Or how you were never a doctor.

1:12:27.290 --> 1:12:30.433
- Shall we move on to the speed contest?

1:12:37.160 --> 1:12:39.130
- Beautiful work Reinaldo.

1:12:39.130 --> 1:12:40.690
- Thank you.

1:12:40.690 --> 1:12:43.870
- Contestants have 90 minutes
to prepare their specimen,

1:12:43.870 --> 1:12:45.530
start to finish.

1:12:45.530 --> 1:12:48.213
Please write down your
scores before moving on.

1:12:58.076 --> 1:13:00.033
- Come on Don, come on.

1:13:11.210 --> 1:13:12.710
- What is it?

1:13:12.710 --> 1:13:13.543
- Nothing.

1:13:14.820 --> 1:13:16.583
I just prefer a cleaner kill.

1:13:19.620 --> 1:13:21.203
- Have you seen his kills?

1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:24.290
They are very sloppy.

1:13:24.290 --> 1:13:27.730
Mistakes, like him.

1:13:27.730 --> 1:13:30.033
- Otis is no longer an artist.

1:13:33.620 --> 1:13:35.333
- You can even see the cut.

1:13:36.600 --> 1:13:39.200
- Before we go on to our next contest,

1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:41.640
I have prepared a little treat.

1:13:41.640 --> 1:13:43.010
Thanks to our esteemed guests

1:13:43.010 --> 1:13:45.470
for providing tonight's desserts.

1:13:45.470 --> 1:13:49.420
The jams are a delicacy
from South America.

1:13:49.420 --> 1:13:54.193
The caviar is organic,
harvested not too far from here.

1:14:15.180 --> 1:14:16.830
- We must talk.

1:14:16.830 --> 1:14:19.540
- This is your night to shine, Reinaldo.

1:14:19.540 --> 1:14:22.440
Go bask in the adulation of your artistry.

1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:24.467
- This contest is rigged.

1:14:27.500 --> 1:14:29.100
- Ridiculous.

1:14:29.100 --> 1:14:31.393
- Favorites seem to always win.

1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:36.360
- Sage, Mildred.

1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:39.470
- Mildred is a true artist,

1:14:39.470 --> 1:14:42.150
learning for centuries
of taxidermification,

1:14:42.150 --> 1:14:43.550
that cannot be learned.

1:14:43.550 --> 1:14:47.313
Do not dare accuse me of a favoritism.

1:15:12.180 --> 1:15:14.630
- Our current speed contest champion

1:15:14.630 --> 1:15:16.920
continues to impress.

1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:21.283
Gutted, stuffed, and ready for
presentation in 90 minutes.

1:15:22.260 --> 1:15:23.093
- Wow.

1:15:28.630 --> 1:15:31.873
- Three entries, how's that even possible?

1:15:46.100 --> 1:15:49.913
- She is the most lifelike
I've seen in 28 years.

1:16:04.477 --> 1:16:05.977
- Is that a tear?

1:16:08.743 --> 1:16:11.633
- Good, well Mildred
is clearly the winner.

1:16:18.603 --> 1:16:20.213
- I think the eye's leaking.

1:16:21.360 --> 1:16:22.453
- Tear looked real.

1:16:23.690 --> 1:16:25.360
It isn't intentional?

1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:27.053
- No, the eye's leaking.

1:16:30.210 --> 1:16:32.083
- I'll score mine, you score yours.

1:16:35.750 --> 1:16:36.583
- Good God.

1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:38.753
There are three.

1:16:47.424 --> 1:16:49.507
Wonderful work.

1:16:50.499 --> 1:16:51.332
- Thank you.

1:16:51.332 --> 1:16:52.710
Very nice.

1:16:52.710 --> 1:16:54.810
- The third subject was hands down

1:16:54.810 --> 1:16:58.172
the most amazing life art I've ever seen.

1:16:58.172 --> 1:16:59.072
- We only had two.

1:17:06.590 --> 1:17:08.803
- Mildred, we need to talk.

1:17:12.860 --> 1:17:15.480
- You little bitch.

1:17:15.480 --> 1:17:19.350
How dare you desecrate my display?

1:17:19.350 --> 1:17:23.170
I'm gonna strangle you
with your own bowels.

1:17:23.170 --> 1:17:24.120
Mildred?

1:17:24.980 --> 1:17:25.870
Mildred!

1:17:25.870 --> 1:17:26.703
- What?

1:17:32.670 --> 1:17:36.260
- I will not tolerate rule breakers.

1:17:36.260 --> 1:17:37.113
Hear this?

1:17:39.260 --> 1:17:41.750
Hollow, hollow!

1:17:41.750 --> 1:17:43.990
Using a mannequin core.

1:17:43.990 --> 1:17:46.363
You are an embarrassment to our industry.

1:17:53.330 --> 1:17:55.150
My apologies.

1:17:55.150 --> 1:17:57.673
We have more housekeeping
this year than usual.

1:17:58.960 --> 1:18:00.663
Please forgive us.

1:18:01.730 --> 1:18:05.200
Mildred's entries have been disqualified.

1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:06.563
Please judge accordingly.

1:18:12.020 --> 1:18:14.383
Does that look like favoritism to you?

1:18:37.630 --> 1:18:39.230
- Who removed the third subject?

1:19:01.550 --> 1:19:02.383
- Excuse me?

1:19:03.572 --> 1:19:04.405
Do you see my phone?

1:19:04.405 --> 1:19:05.238
I can't find it.

1:19:08.010 --> 1:19:08.843
- No.

1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:11.370
It's too dark.

1:19:40.510 --> 1:19:42.400
- We need to take a moment

1:19:42.400 --> 1:19:44.960
to thank our guests who are not artists,

1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:48.830
but choose to participate
through their generous donations.

1:19:48.830 --> 1:19:49.773
Mister Landem.

1:19:52.810 --> 1:19:54.696
Mister and Missus Henderson.

1:19:59.164 --> 1:20:01.380
And we cannot forget the Muddles.

1:20:01.380 --> 1:20:04.823
They gave so generously to our
recreation contest tonight.

1:20:18.930 --> 1:20:20.010
- I have to pee.

1:20:20.010 --> 1:20:20.853
- You just went.

1:20:23.020 --> 1:20:23.853
- I'm good.

1:20:23.853 --> 1:20:24.710
- They want to see.

1:20:28.350 --> 1:20:29.870
- Crank it up.

1:20:29.870 --> 1:20:31.420
- What are you doing down here?

1:20:33.183 --> 1:20:35.053
- I may have told a fib earlier.

1:20:36.479 --> 1:20:39.363
- And how do you know
this young lady, Beatrice?

1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:42.420
- We just met.

1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:43.253
She's the buzz.

1:20:44.680 --> 1:20:45.860
Get it?

1:20:45.860 --> 1:20:46.693
- No.

1:20:52.440 --> 1:20:53.640
What the hell?

1:20:54.686 --> 1:20:55.936
- Tia, run now.

1:21:06.380 --> 1:21:07.213
- Tia?

1:21:08.958 --> 1:21:10.956
- Thank you, Donald.

1:21:10.956 --> 1:21:12.410
- So I see you met my stepdaughter.

1:21:12.410 --> 1:21:13.490
- Just now.

1:21:13.490 --> 1:21:15.593
She'll make an excellent specimen.

1:21:18.260 --> 1:21:19.360
- My gift to you, dad.

1:21:20.999 --> 1:21:22.049
- Are you kidding me?

1:21:24.020 --> 1:21:26.180
- Her brother's locked in the corn crib.

1:21:26.180 --> 1:21:27.668
Kill him.

1:21:27.668 --> 1:21:28.870
- Our mom trusted you.

1:21:28.870 --> 1:21:30.879
- Funny, so did your dad,

1:21:30.879 --> 1:21:32.177
but look what that got him.

1:21:34.374 --> 1:21:35.863
He was my first artwork.

1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:38.090
- You fucker.

1:21:38.090 --> 1:21:41.260
- Ooh, language child, language.

1:21:41.260 --> 1:21:43.743
How rude the undead specimens can be.

1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:46.643
Is that your other kid?

1:21:48.947 --> 1:21:49.780
- Tia, come on.

1:21:53.279 --> 1:21:54.112
Tia!

1:22:05.054 --> 1:22:07.380
- Where's the girl?

1:22:07.380 --> 1:22:09.780
- Check the barn, check
the corn, the house, go.

1:22:12.799 --> 1:22:13.632
- Kill him, sir?

1:22:15.559 --> 1:22:17.200
Now that you know.

1:22:17.200 --> 1:22:18.383
Put him in Otis' lab.

1:22:20.235 --> 1:22:21.120
- Don.

1:22:21.120 --> 1:22:22.260
- Wrong place, wrong time.

1:22:22.260 --> 1:22:23.093
- You fucker.

1:22:23.093 --> 1:22:24.110
- Watch your manners.

1:23:11.420 --> 1:23:12.665
- Cary?

1:23:12.665 --> 1:23:14.220
Hide.

1:23:14.220 --> 1:23:15.987
- No, there's not enough time.

1:23:21.880 --> 1:23:23.650
- The poser.

1:23:23.650 --> 1:23:25.830
- I hope you like that suit.

1:23:25.830 --> 1:23:27.570
You're gonna die in it.

1:23:27.570 --> 1:23:30.443
- If I had a nickel for
every time I heard that.

1:23:31.510 --> 1:23:32.760
Time for you to be eaten.

1:23:40.540 --> 1:23:42.920
If you could see your face.

1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:44.940
Is that what you think of us?

1:23:44.940 --> 1:23:47.060
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1:23:47.060 --> 1:23:51.010
Cannibalism is for the
desperate, and the uncultured.

1:23:51.010 --> 1:23:56.010
Now I heard you'd actually
slept in Otis' house last night.

1:23:57.150 --> 1:24:00.130
I wouldn't stay in that
sty if you paid me.

1:24:00.130 --> 1:24:00.963
- Simon's.

1:24:02.620 --> 1:24:03.603
- Who's Simon?

1:24:05.250 --> 1:24:06.293
Search the house.

1:24:08.740 --> 1:24:09.640
Now where were we?

1:24:16.530 --> 1:24:19.123
My Uber made this in 1932.

1:24:20.100 --> 1:24:22.360
We have a rich history.

1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:25.650
Our founders perfected an ancient science

1:24:25.650 --> 1:24:29.880
that relies heavily on a
very specialized skillset.

1:24:29.880 --> 1:24:32.310
Lauded by Kings and Lords,

1:24:32.310 --> 1:24:35.150
it was a highly sought after occupation.

1:24:35.150 --> 1:24:36.400
- You're sick.

1:24:36.400 --> 1:24:39.300
Not even a hunter would think
about doing this crazy shit.

1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:42.030
- Hunter?

1:24:42.030 --> 1:24:44.090
Do you think I'm some sort of scavenger,

1:24:44.090 --> 1:24:45.860
scurrying through the underbrush,

1:24:45.860 --> 1:24:47.600
looking for rabbits and rodents?

1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:49.060
- No, I don't think you heard me.

1:24:49.060 --> 1:24:50.333
I said you're worse.

1:24:52.516 --> 1:24:56.010
- We perfected art and
science for the ages.

1:24:56.010 --> 1:24:59.853
The stuffed human, captured
in a lifelike state.

1:25:01.930 --> 1:25:03.740
- You're crazy, motherfucker.

1:25:05.620 --> 1:25:08.120
- He needs an attitude adjustment.

1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:13.120
Prep him for exploratory
surgery, nervous system.

1:25:13.190 --> 1:25:14.143
Pick a leg.

1:25:17.180 --> 1:25:18.230
This may sting a bit.

1:25:31.972 --> 1:25:33.627
- Cary?

1:25:33.627 --> 1:25:36.030
We should have known Don was one of them.

1:25:36.030 --> 1:25:38.023
I found this by the car.

1:25:39.410 --> 1:25:40.527
He let the air out.

1:26:19.170 --> 1:26:21.020
- Anyone down here that shouldn't be?

1:26:22.147 --> 1:26:23.578
Otis?

1:26:23.578 --> 1:26:26.078
Don't waste your time.

1:27:45.982 --> 1:27:46.815
- Quiet.

1:27:46.815 --> 1:27:47.648
Or we're dead.

1:27:48.603 --> 1:27:49.923
- I don't care.

1:27:49.923 --> 1:27:51.256
- Don't give up.

1:27:54.406 --> 1:27:56.703
Who are you with?

1:27:56.703 --> 1:27:57.536
- What?

1:27:57.536 --> 1:27:58.600
- Us or them?

1:27:59.720 --> 1:28:00.553
- Myself.

1:28:01.430 --> 1:28:02.820
I'm here for revenge.

1:28:07.187 --> 1:28:08.020
I found these.

1:28:11.710 --> 1:28:13.540
Create a distraction.

1:28:13.540 --> 1:28:14.790
I'll go for Cary.

1:28:22.720 --> 1:28:23.960
- Otis,

1:28:23.960 --> 1:28:25.913
we got some big damn rats in here.

1:28:30.956 --> 1:28:32.539
- You little brat.

1:28:33.738 --> 1:28:34.650
Look what you did.

1:28:34.650 --> 1:28:35.700
He loves you.

1:28:36.597 --> 1:28:38.723
- It's on you, you did this.

1:28:39.665 --> 1:28:41.490
.

1:28:41.490 --> 1:28:42.323
Oh well.

1:28:46.476 --> 1:28:49.510
You should have left when
I gave you the chance.

1:28:49.510 --> 1:28:50.660
You really should have.

1:28:54.144 --> 1:28:55.003
Hey, calm down now.

1:28:56.570 --> 1:28:57.460
Come on now.

1:28:57.460 --> 1:28:59.266
You don't want to shoot
anybody now do you?

1:29:03.540 --> 1:29:05.863
Look like daddy only
gave his boy the lessons.

1:29:09.082 --> 1:29:10.500
I gotta admit,

1:29:10.500 --> 1:29:12.050
I learned a lot from your pops,

1:29:12.980 --> 1:29:15.730
and he screamed like a little
baby when we drained him.

1:29:16.611 --> 1:29:18.863
But he did manage to get a few licks in.

1:29:23.458 --> 1:29:24.320
You know, I'm actually glad

1:29:24.320 --> 1:29:26.070
you inserted yourself into my work.

1:29:27.180 --> 1:29:28.323
Saved me some time.

1:29:28.323 --> 1:29:29.793
With you two gone,

1:29:30.660 --> 1:29:32.373
I can work on my masterpiece.

1:29:34.190 --> 1:29:36.663
Your mom will be a beauty for the ages.

1:29:41.811 --> 1:29:42.700
Hey, come on now.

1:29:42.700 --> 1:29:44.605
- You will never be my dad.

1:30:08.077 --> 1:30:08.910
- Run Tia.

1:30:14.364 --> 1:30:15.864
- That was so bad.

1:30:19.199 --> 1:30:21.142
I'm right behind you, go.

1:30:21.142 --> 1:30:22.267
Go, go.

1:31:27.610 --> 1:31:28.480
- Come, Beat.

1:31:28.480 --> 1:31:30.409
There's no time to waste.

1:31:30.409 --> 1:31:32.242
- Not till I see her.

1:31:34.510 --> 1:31:35.923
- She's in the trailer.

1:31:37.467 --> 1:31:38.300
- Really?

1:31:42.040 --> 1:31:43.753
- My word is my bond.

1:31:46.140 --> 1:31:47.633
We've got a schedule to keep.

1:32:18.220 --> 1:32:19.053
Satisfied?

1:32:21.430 --> 1:32:22.913
Oh Beat, not again.

1:32:24.490 --> 1:32:25.343
- Hi mommy.

1:32:26.390 --> 1:32:27.233
I miss you.

1:32:30.430 --> 1:32:32.120
- Okay, come child.

1:32:32.120 --> 1:32:34.720
You can see her again when
we reach our destination.

1:32:37.150 --> 1:32:38.740
- You look angry.

1:32:38.740 --> 1:32:40.230
Me too.

1:32:40.230 --> 1:32:43.773
Daddy won't let us hang out, anymore.

1:32:47.160 --> 1:32:48.260
I'll ride with her.

1:32:48.260 --> 1:32:49.700
- No you won't.

1:32:49.700 --> 1:32:52.180
You can get hurt riding back here.

1:32:52.180 --> 1:32:53.800
- I'm already damaged.

1:32:53.800 --> 1:32:54.750
It's what you said.

1:32:55.650 --> 1:32:57.143
- You misunderstood.

1:32:59.530 --> 1:33:01.010
- Not without mommy.

1:33:05.730 --> 1:33:07.203
- Now see what you've done?

1:33:10.220 --> 1:33:11.053
- Fix her.

1:33:12.410 --> 1:33:13.970
You can fix her, daddy.

1:33:13.970 --> 1:33:16.693
- Yes, I'll fix her good
as new, now come on.

1:33:25.570 --> 1:33:27.600
- Bury her in the woods.

1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:29.133
I'm done with this charade.

1:33:37.168 --> 1:33:38.703
- Cary, Cary?

1:33:46.010 --> 1:33:47.633
Here, grab it.

1:33:55.865 --> 1:33:58.835
Okay.

1:33:58.835 --> 1:34:03.835
Okay.

1:34:11.070 --> 1:34:13.093
- I thought you'd never get my point.

1:34:14.180 --> 1:34:15.810
Stake her out.

1:34:15.810 --> 1:34:18.060
- Shouldn't we bury her,
it'll be light soon.

1:34:22.500 --> 1:34:24.810
- When I want your thoughts, Jarvis,

1:34:24.810 --> 1:34:27.723
I'll just set that
pea-sized brain of yours.

1:34:54.510 --> 1:34:55.433
We're done here.

1:34:59.300 --> 1:35:00.890
Hard to see?

1:35:00.890 --> 1:35:01.863
Poor thing.

1:35:02.870 --> 1:35:06.210
As your life drains away, remember,

1:35:06.210 --> 1:35:10.900
it's fear, followed by
denial, hopelessness,

1:35:10.900 --> 1:35:12.683
and then finally acceptance.

1:35:13.710 --> 1:35:15.563
But I doubt you'll last that long.

1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:19.260
Goodbye, little troublemaker.

1:35:19.260 --> 1:35:20.093
Gentlemen.

1:36:01.640 --> 1:36:03.943
Did you get any petrol on the house?

1:36:14.090 --> 1:36:16.050
You see your sister over there?

1:36:16.050 --> 1:36:18.230
The last vision she's gonna see,

1:36:18.230 --> 1:36:21.097
is your scrawny head popping like a zit.

1:37:55.006 --> 1:37:55.839
- Oh God, Cary.

1:37:55.839 --> 1:37:56.672
Oh my God.

1:37:58.210 --> 1:37:59.043
You okay?

1:38:00.269 --> 1:38:03.057
Hey Simon, Simon.

1:38:06.400 --> 1:38:08.223
- I just want to go home.

1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:11.720
Oh for God's sake, Otis.

1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:12.993
Use the door.

1:38:14.350 --> 1:38:15.853
Would you please die?

1:38:24.500 --> 1:38:25.417
- Hi daddy.

1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:27.423
Did I do it right?

1:38:31.087 --> 1:38:33.043
- Hey, help me put pressure.

1:38:35.950 --> 1:38:38.320
- It's okay, go find Tia.

1:38:38.320 --> 1:38:39.153
Save Tia.

1:39:01.029 --> 1:39:01.862
- Tia.

1:39:29.737 --> 1:39:30.570
Tia?

1:39:46.978 --> 1:39:47.811
- Hey Sis.

1:40:34.870 --> 1:40:36.037
Otis.
