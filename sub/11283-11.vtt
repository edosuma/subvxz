WEBVTT

00:05.740 --> 00:08.340
(phone rings)

00:09.377 --> 00:11.443
It's him.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.114
You're late.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.249
Yeah, I know.
There was an accident.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.784
Accident? Is Jeremy okay?

00:18.786 --> 00:20.786
He's-he's lost a lot of blood.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.755
Listen, Paul,
they know we're gone, all right?

00:22.757 --> 00:24.556
The police are looking for me.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.725
Then you better get him over
here or the deal is off.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.161
Let me talk to her.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.629
Are you giving me
orders, Officer?

00:30.631 --> 00:32.264
Paul, you want your nephew free,

00:32.266 --> 00:34.533
you let me talk to my daughter
right now.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.469
Now tell your daddy

00:37.471 --> 00:39.438
how well
we're taking care of you.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.373
Dad...

00:41.375 --> 00:43.308
Hey, sweetheart.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.377
I'm so sorry, Dad.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.246
I'm so sorry.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.755
(woman cries out indistinctly)

00:56.757 --> 00:58.824
(people moaning, woman sobbing)

01:06.534 --> 01:10.102
(low groaning)

01:12.506 --> 01:15.274
(woman sobbing, people moaning)

01:17.778 --> 01:19.211
(siren wailing)

01:19.213 --> 01:21.363
MAN (over radio):
<i> All units 10-36.</i>

01:21.364 --> 01:23.514
<i> Vehicular collision.</i>
<i> 427 and concession road 6.</i>

01:23.517 --> 01:25.284
(tires squealing)

01:25.286 --> 01:27.119
(siren stops)

01:27.121 --> 01:28.854
I need you people
to move back.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.190
Clear these vehicles
for emergency.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.461
(groans)

01:35.463 --> 01:36.795
Brother, you okay?

01:36.797 --> 01:39.531
Yeah. The seat belt's jammed.
All right.

01:39.533 --> 01:42.468
Dispatch,
this is 51-10 on scene.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.137
Collision involving squad,
unmarked, 52 Division.

01:45.139 --> 01:47.506
Sergeant...
MacCoy.
Sergeant MacCoy.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.408
conscious and responsive.
He's trapped inside his vehicle.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.577
Okay, I just need you to hold
on-- I'll be right back.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.645
I got to check on
the bus passengers.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.380
Is everyone in there all right?

01:55.382 --> 01:56.615
WOMAN:
Somebody help us.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.455
(gunshots)
(people screaming)

02:03.457 --> 02:05.290
MAN:
Shut up!

02:10.564 --> 02:11.797
I got a 10-33.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.899
Shots fired. I've been hit.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.901
Repeat, officer down.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.803
(panting)

02:17.805 --> 02:19.872
(alarm sounds)
WINNIE:<i> Team One, hot call.</i>

02:19.874 --> 02:21.473
Shots fired at the scene
of a car accident

02:21.475 --> 02:23.642
that involved a Nationcrest bus
and a squad car.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.611
<i> The driver of the police car</i>
<i> is okay,</i>

02:25.613 --> 02:27.346
<i> but trapped in his vehicle.</i>

02:27.348 --> 02:29.265
First responder took a bullet.

02:29.266 --> 02:31.183
Any I.D. and status
on the officer?
His name's Fletcher.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.652
Dispatch says he's taken cover
but is pinned down on the scene.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.521
Fletcher's pretty sure
the passengers on the bus

02:35.523 --> 02:37.523
are now hostages.

02:37.525 --> 02:40.526
(sirens wailing,
Fletcher panting)

02:46.901 --> 02:48.500
(siren stops)

02:56.877 --> 02:59.611
Can't get a visual
inside of that bus.

02:59.613 --> 03:02.214
The officer in the unmarked
is going to have to wait.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.749
We got to get
Fletcher out of there.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.884
Uniforms have set a perimeter
and they're holding traffic.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.586
SAM: The bus went over
less than 20 minutes ago.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.621
No sign of anyone leaving,

03:09.623 --> 03:10.622
no contact with
the shooter.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.541
Okay, Eddie.
Wordy, Sam,

03:12.542 --> 03:14.459
let's figure a way
to get Fletcher out of there.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.828
This is Sergeant Greg Parker

03:16.830 --> 03:19.464
with the Police Strategic
Response Unit.

03:19.466 --> 03:22.367
I'm here to help you
and everyone on that bus.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.635
(gunshot)

03:23.637 --> 03:25.604
PARKER:
Fire and EMS,
you got to fall back.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.773
Fall back now.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.675
(door opening)

03:29.677 --> 03:31.577
Okay, not ready to talk.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.978
Who are we dealing with?

03:32.980 --> 03:35.280
Bus manifest shows
only the driver

03:35.282 --> 03:36.615
and six passengers on board.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.817
None with a criminal
or mental health record.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.319
Winnie, we got an I.D.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.554
on the driver
of the unmarked police vehicle?

03:42.556 --> 03:45.257
Yes, it was driven by a Sergeant
MacCoy from 52 Division.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.291
Oliver MacCoy?

03:46.293 --> 03:48.327
Copy.
What's his condition?

03:48.329 --> 03:49.828
Dispatch can't raise him
on the radio.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.230
Last report was conscious
and responsive.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.631
You know this guy, Spike?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.399
Yeah, I know this guy.
There's no one like this guy.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.701
He was my training officer.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.402
I rolled with him
my first two years

03:57.404 --> 03:58.570
(typing)
out of the academy.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.305
He was the first one
to call me Spike.

04:00.307 --> 04:02.441
Well, maybe he can help us out.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.576
Dispatch says his radio's still
down-- they can't reach him.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.279
But he carries a cell.

04:07.281 --> 04:11.016
(phone ringing)

04:11.018 --> 04:12.317
(groans)

04:17.358 --> 04:20.559
Officer Scarlatti,
about time you called.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.027
Mac, you okay in there?

04:22.029 --> 04:24.296
Yeah, it's just a knock
on the head-- it's no big deal.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.731
What's the condition
of that first responder?

04:25.733 --> 04:27.266
He's shot in the thigh.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.734
He's pinned down
on the other side of the bus.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.335
Any idea who
the shooter is?

04:30.337 --> 04:31.737
Yeah, a couple of punk dealers

04:31.739 --> 04:33.739
I was taking
from 52 back to lockup.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.275
Names are Fawcett and Bullard.

04:36.277 --> 04:39.444
Must have got my shotgun
when I was out cold.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.779
All right, Mac, sit tight.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.281
Promise we'll have you out
of there in no time.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.749
And no promises.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.417
I taught you better than that.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.852
Yes, sir.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.488
Rookie lesson--
make no promises.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.024
Cops are human.
We only do what we can.
He's right.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.599
(panting)

05:00.601 --> 05:02.367
Brett, man, we got to get
the hell out of here.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.069
No, it's like I told you--
they're not going

05:04.071 --> 05:06.371
to come in here
as long as we have hostages.

05:06.373 --> 05:07.673
My arm is messed up, man.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.574
You're going to be fine.

05:09.576 --> 05:10.976
Here...

05:12.346 --> 05:14.780
...tie that around it.
Please, let us go.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.081
Shut up!

05:16.083 --> 05:17.749
Stay down!

05:17.751 --> 05:19.084
Nobody goes anywhere unless

05:19.086 --> 05:20.886
I say they do.
I will kill anyone

05:20.888 --> 05:22.888
who tries to leave.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.858
PARKER:
What's up, Jules?

05:26.860 --> 05:29.394
Fletcher's lost a lot of blood.
Says he can't walk.

05:29.396 --> 05:32.497
How we getting him out, Ed?
Only one way to do this.
Turtle formations,

05:32.499 --> 05:34.333
use the shields,
use the bulrushes as cover.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.401
Once we get to him,
we'll be exposed.

05:36.403 --> 05:39.371
Wish we had eyes up there.
Maybe we do.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.540
All right, let's
get the shields.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.709
What can you see, Mac?

05:43.711 --> 05:45.577
Hang on.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.979
Fawcett's at the front
of the bus

05:47.981 --> 05:49.348
with the SLP.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.949
If your guys approach
from the rear,

05:50.951 --> 05:52.884
you should be okay.
SPIKE:
Guys, Mac says

05:52.886 --> 05:55.387
you're clear if Fawcett's still
at the front of the bus.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.889
We're coming in, Mac.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.390
Don't you worry about me.
You know protocol.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.492
Get the injured officer
to safety

06:00.494 --> 06:02.561
then secure the civilians
on that bus.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.841
PARKER:
Hey, buddy.

06:15.843 --> 06:18.143
Can you stand?
I don't know.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.512
Holster your weapon.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.416
ED:
Boss, that fuel tank
is ruptured.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.754
Okay, on three.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.455
One, two, three.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.524
(clattering)
What the hell was that?

06:32.526 --> 06:33.925
Somebody's out there, man.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.094
Spike, get your guys
out of there.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.529
He heard them.
Boss, you got move, now!

06:37.531 --> 06:38.864
(groans)

06:45.105 --> 06:46.772
(woman in bus screams)

06:48.675 --> 06:50.842
That was way too close.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.744
WORDY:
Look, there's smoke coming
from under the bus.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.680
PARKER:
Must have caught a spark
from the shotgun.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.850
A couple minutes, that whole
thing's going up in flames.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.787
Can't let the fire trucks down
there with an active shooter.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.488
PARKER (over bullhorn):
The bus is on fire.

07:03.490 --> 07:06.792
You need to get everyone
out of there before it explodes.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.462
It's still ours, Eddie.
Let's move.

07:10.464 --> 07:13.732
V formation.
Suppression tanks, masks on.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.476
MAN:
Let's get out of here!

07:24.478 --> 07:26.611
ED:
Hold position, hold position.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.113
The window's opening.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.549
ED:
What do we got?
What do we got?

07:30.551 --> 07:33.018
PARKER:
Where's the shooter?
We don't know.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.620
ED:
Let's get this fire out.
Let's go, let's go.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.658
WOMAN:
Please, the driver,

07:39.660 --> 07:41.159
he's unconscious--
you have to help him.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.966
PARKER:
Look at me.
You have to lead the way.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.801
Single file up the hill, okay?
Go!

07:49.803 --> 07:52.637
ED:
Boss, Sam and I are going in.
Copy.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.906
SAM:
Bus is clear.
No sign of suspects.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.208
One civilian down.

07:57.711 --> 08:01.079
Police. Police.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.215
Sam, this thing's going to blow.
Let's get him out of here.

08:03.217 --> 08:04.916
Come on, buddy.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.087
Spike, Jules, let's get
the water cannons down here.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.255
Let's move out. Let's go.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.623
Jules, wait, we got to get Mac.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.193
Mac. Mac!

08:16.930 --> 08:19.631
Where the hell did he go?

08:19.633 --> 08:20.899
He must have gone.
Come on, Spike.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.067
SPIKE:
Where the hell did he go?

08:22.069 --> 08:23.535
JULES:
The bus is going to blow.

08:23.537 --> 08:24.803
Mac!

08:24.805 --> 08:25.871
Spike!

09:06.813 --> 09:08.680
K-9's on its way.

09:08.682 --> 09:09.948
We got a chopper coming
with infrared.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.550
How we doing
on containment?

09:11.552 --> 09:12.851
Contained this area here,

09:12.853 --> 09:14.653
and to this point
on the highway.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.688
But over on this side, the woods
connect to an industrial park

09:16.690 --> 09:18.323
next to the airport.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.592
We just don't have enough
manpower to contain it yet.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.327
Okay. Jules, what do you got?

09:22.329 --> 09:23.962
All the passengers
are accounted for,

09:23.964 --> 09:26.231
but nobody saw Fawcett
or Bullard take off.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.632
They must have escaped
during the rescue.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.601
Any luck?
SPIKE:
His phone's in the car,

09:29.603 --> 09:31.570
but nobody saw Mac
come back this way.

09:31.572 --> 09:32.571
He just disappeared.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.123
All right, until
we know better,

09:34.124 --> 09:35.674
we've got to assume that
Fawcett and Bullard have him.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.175
Took him as a hostage.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.644
Can use him as a bargaining chip
if we corner them again.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.646
Okay, Sam, Jules,

09:41.648 --> 09:43.882
bravo team moving southwest.
Wordy and I alpha team

09:43.884 --> 09:45.650
moving northwest.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.118
You guys stay sharp.
By my count,

09:47.120 --> 09:49.087
there's still another five
rounds left in that SLP.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.090
Spike, don't worry--
we're gonna find him.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.725
Let's move out.
Copy.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.226
Winnie.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.628
Yeah, boss.
Contact narcotics.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.614
I want to know everything

09:58.615 --> 10:00.599
they have on Brett Fawcett
and Jeremy Bullard.

10:00.601 --> 10:03.635
Everything and anything
that's not on their sheets.

10:03.637 --> 10:04.869
Copy that.
I'll let you know what I find.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.644
The chopper will be here
any minute.
Right.

10:12.646 --> 10:13.979
I shouldn't have
let this happen.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.081
I should have got him
out of that car.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.216
Spike, you did exactly
what you were supposed to do.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.352
Exactly the way
you needed to do it.

10:20.354 --> 10:22.220
You got those civilians
out of there safely.

10:22.222 --> 10:25.090
Boss, Oliver MacCoy
wasn't just my T.O.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.959
He helped me through a lot of
stuff those first couple years.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.128
My father wasn't too big
about me being police.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.631
My mother never wants to take
sides, so I didn't have anybody.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.133
But I had Mac. Mac was there.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.102
He was one of those guys
who teaches by example.

10:37.104 --> 10:40.138
He's one of those guys
I wanted to grow up to be.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.140
And he saved my life
more than once.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.642
Okay, Officer.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.276
It's time to return the favor.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.679
Let's get on with that chopper,
and figure out where he is.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.848
All right.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.316
Copy that, boss.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.184
(helicopter blades whirring)

10:57.424 --> 11:00.158
Alpha one clear.
Heading west.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.263
SAM:
They've been through here.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.831
There's fresh blood
on the trail.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.768
It looks like
they're heading north.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.705
Mac only had a knock to the
head. If it's his blood...

11:13.707 --> 11:15.206
Let's not jump
to conclusions, buddy.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.075
(typing)
One step at a time.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.717
(beeping)
Imager's got something.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.118
WORDY:
Over there.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.697
Boss, we got
a bloody T-shirt here.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.132
ED:
Somebody's in pretty bad shape.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.435
Yeah, copy that.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.437
We'll notify hospitals
and local clinics

11:45.439 --> 11:46.905
in case that's
where they're headed.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.040
Boss, I've got something
on Fawcett and Bullard.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.141
Go ahead, Winnie.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.476
Seems they were arrested
last Friday,

11:51.478 --> 11:53.378
trying to move
large amounts of heroin.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.480
They're each facing
at least ten years.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.148
That's reason enough to run.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.783
They were also flagged
by Guns and Gangs.

11:58.785 --> 12:02.287
Turns out Jeremy Bullard's uncle
is Paul Bullard.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.222
Paul Bullard?
Leader of the Bedlam gang?

12:04.224 --> 12:06.291
I'm sending you the file now.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.759
SPIKE:
There he is.

12:07.761 --> 12:08.960
SAM:
So these guys are drug dealers?

12:08.962 --> 12:10.829
ED:
More than that.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.832
Bedlam runs drugs, guns
and prostitution

12:13.834 --> 12:15.033
on the whole west side.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.301
Weren't Bedlam suspected

12:16.303 --> 12:17.469
in those pipe bomb killings
a few months back?

12:17.471 --> 12:18.971
PARKER:
Yeah.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.472
Those and a dozen others.
Gang Unit's been trying

12:20.474 --> 12:21.439
to put Paul Bullard away
for years.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.775
ED:
If these guys are tight

12:23.777 --> 12:26.077
with Bedlam,
it changes everything.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.378
They make contact,
we are into a whole new mess.

12:28.381 --> 12:29.914
(computer chirps)
Boss, I got something.

12:29.916 --> 12:33.151
Chopper's picking up
heat signatures in Bravo Four.

12:33.153 --> 12:36.221
Sam and Jules, that's
about 300 meters

12:36.223 --> 12:37.489
northwest of your position.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.491
How many?

12:39.493 --> 12:40.492
SAM:
All of them?

12:40.494 --> 12:41.459
Looks like one.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.061
It could be Mac.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.796
We don't know that for sure.
Approach with caution.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.264
JULES:
Copy that.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.441
(helicopter flying overhead)

13:01.515 --> 13:03.348
That's it.
Another 50 meters.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.920
Just go careful,
please, guys.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.522
They've already
shot one cop today.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.924
Copy that, boss.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.535
SAM:
Police! Drop your weapon!

13:23.537 --> 13:25.003
Bravo?

13:25.005 --> 13:26.905
PARKER:
What's your status?
Let's go.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.073
No harm. It's not Mac.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.942
SAM:
Subject's on the run.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.911
(panting)

13:32.913 --> 13:34.579
He's headed west.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.888
(grunts)

13:43.890 --> 13:44.556
ED:
Got him, boss.

13:44.558 --> 13:46.157
Where are they?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.959
I don't know.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.862
ED:
Come on. That's not good enough.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.531
When the bus caught fire,
I helped Jeremy out the window,

13:53.533 --> 13:56.334
and by the time
I hit the ground,

13:56.336 --> 13:58.036
they were halfway to the trees.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.370
Where did Jeremy
take the officer?

13:59.372 --> 14:00.939
Man, you got
it backwards.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.341
It was the cop
who was taking Jeremy.

14:04.911 --> 14:05.877
(computer trilling)

14:20.126 --> 14:21.526
Put the cell phone down,
ma'am. Put it down.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.894
Okay. I'm putting it down.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.896
Step out of the car.

14:24.898 --> 14:25.864
Step aside.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.966
Sir, what's
going on here?

14:27.968 --> 14:30.501
Can you tell me
what's going on?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.104
Sir!

14:34.074 --> 14:36.107
He's sticking to his story.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.043
He said he saw MacCoy drag
Jeremy Bullard into the woods.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.945
Fawcett took off
in the opposite direction.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.213
He hasn't seen them since.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.348
Well, he's got to be lying.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.617
He's trying to throw us off.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.885
Just got a report
from a woman over on Massey

14:47.888 --> 14:50.421
who was carjacked
near the industrial park.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.923
She said a police officer
pulled a gun,

14:51.925 --> 14:53.591
threw her out of her car.
No.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.093
No. Mac wouldn't
do that.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.394
Spike, how well
do you know MacCoy?

14:56.396 --> 14:57.562
As well as I know
any of you guys.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.014
Okay.

14:59.015 --> 15:00.465
Sam, did you get a make
and model of the car?

15:00.467 --> 15:02.217
And a license plate.
There's an APB out.

15:02.218 --> 15:03.968
ED:
All right. Let's get over
to that industrial park.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.603
Spike, you're with me.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.171
Winnie?

15:07.173 --> 15:08.907
Yeah, boss?
Contact 52 Division.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.408
Anything you can find out

15:10.410 --> 15:11.509
about Sergeant
Oliver MacCoy.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.543
Copy that, boss.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.612
We have to find out
what's going on.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.618
Please.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.186
Let's just go back.

15:22.188 --> 15:24.055
You can turn me in.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.524
Too late for that.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.026
(breathing heavily)

16:01.127 --> 16:02.427
Any luck with
traffic cameras?

16:02.429 --> 16:03.494
Not this far out.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.263
But that car they jacked
comes loaded

16:05.265 --> 16:07.198
with a Journeypath
GPS tracking system.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.416
You can pinpoint
the car's location?

16:08.417 --> 16:09.633
Yeah. I'm uploading
to the server now.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.569
We'll have a location
in five minutes.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.438
Boss, I found something
on Sergeant MacCoy.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.139
Go ahead, Winnie.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.975
I contacted 52 Division,
and it seems

16:16.977 --> 16:19.544
MacCoy wasn't scheduled to be
on that transport detail.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.046
He switched shifts?

16:21.047 --> 16:22.547
First thing this morning.
People swap shifts all the time.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.515
According to the other officer,
Sergeant MacCoy

16:24.517 --> 16:26.617
pulled rank and then ordered him
off the detail,

16:26.619 --> 16:27.618
then insisted on going alone.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.754
Okay. Thanks, Winnie.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.322
Boss, just doesn't
make any sense.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.091
Mac's a decorated
police officer.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.159
I can't believe he'd plan this.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.128
You know of any connection

16:37.130 --> 16:39.230
between him and
this Bullard kid?

16:39.232 --> 16:42.033
Wait. Jeremy Bullard got busted
for dealing, right?

16:42.035 --> 16:43.101
Heroin.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.569
Okay. Mac's got
a daughter, Leslie.

16:44.571 --> 16:45.570
She's had a pretty serious

16:45.572 --> 16:47.305
drug problem for a while now.

16:47.307 --> 16:50.608
But the last time I saw
them both, she was clean.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.177
Dad, I think we need
to turn it the other way.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.545
Just clock it left, honey.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.114
It's going to wrap right
around the doorframe.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.315
SPIKE:
Better do what he says.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.517
You'll just end up doing
it his way, anyway.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.487
Spike, hey.
Hey, Les.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.189
Got a housewarming.
Sorry, I couldn't find a pot.

17:06.326 --> 17:09.327
You know what? I think
I have the perfect one inside.

17:09.329 --> 17:12.230
Just like an SRU hotshot.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.265
Show up right at the end,
claim all the glory.

17:14.267 --> 17:17.168
You want something done right,
you got to know who to call.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.636
(Spike grunts)

17:18.638 --> 17:19.670
Got it?

17:19.672 --> 17:20.505
You got the girl's end.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.540
Yeah?

17:25.812 --> 17:28.046
Well, I see sitting
at that computer

17:28.048 --> 17:29.414
hasn't made you
completely soft.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.282
Yeah, well, clearly,
the beat's keeping you

17:31.284 --> 17:32.583
in peak physical shape.

17:32.585 --> 17:33.818
You're not sticking your
hair up in the air anymore

17:33.820 --> 17:34.819
with all that mousse.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.421
It was gel.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.688
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.624
How is she?

17:39.626 --> 17:40.825
Oh, she's doing
real good.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.461
She's been clean for
three months now.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.264
I sent her up north to that
rehab place, Three Oaks.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.698
Did a good job with her.

17:47.700 --> 17:48.699
They really
straightened her out.

17:48.701 --> 17:49.600
Well, if you
need anything...

17:49.602 --> 17:51.135
Yeah, I know. I know.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.371
I can handle it, but
I know who to call.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.606
It's a little big,

17:55.608 --> 17:57.842
but what do you think?

17:57.844 --> 17:59.177
Well, that's perfect, honey.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.245
That's, uh...
that's beautiful.

18:04.284 --> 18:07.785
Mac paid for the place,
even helped her find a job.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.621
Three Oaks.
That rehab's not cheap.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.790
Mac's wife, Rose,
died a year ago,

18:12.792 --> 18:14.559
and Leslie took it pretty hard.

18:14.561 --> 18:17.228
Mac tried everything, and that
was the only place that worked.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.663
So if Leslie
did relapse,

18:18.665 --> 18:20.631
and Mac knew who
sold her the drugs,

18:20.633 --> 18:22.300
maybe he's looking for
some kind of, uh...

18:22.302 --> 18:23.568
payback,

18:23.570 --> 18:25.370
somebody to blame.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.171
He knows it doesn't work
that way. He's a cop.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.773
Spike, he's also a father.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.842
Ed and Wordy, you
guys keep looking

18:30.844 --> 18:32.343
in the industrial park.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.411
Copy that.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.679
PARKER:
Sam and Jules,

18:34.681 --> 18:36.247
head over
to the daughter's place.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.682
Maybe she's got something

18:37.684 --> 18:39.684
that can help us figure
out what's going on here.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.119
SAM:
Got it. Location?

18:41.121 --> 18:42.887
It's an apartment building
in Bloor West.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.555
Uh, 2015 Drewry.

18:44.557 --> 18:45.723
Copy.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.629
SPIKE:
<i> I found MacCoy.</i>

18:51.631 --> 18:54.499
Satellite's got a
location on the car.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.733
Looking at a warehouse

18:55.735 --> 18:57.335
at Balmoral and Ross.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.736
That's six blocks
from here.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.138
Spike, which way they headed?

19:00.140 --> 19:02.240
Tracker says
the car's not moving.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.441
We're on it.
(siren wails)

19:03.443 --> 19:05.576
Let's get him before he
starts moving again.

19:05.578 --> 19:06.577
We're right behind you.

19:06.579 --> 19:07.912
So what's the call here?

19:09.415 --> 19:12.517
Till we know otherwise,
we treat him as hostile.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.588
(tires screech, siren wailing)

19:17.590 --> 19:18.823
(siren stops)

19:22.529 --> 19:24.512
What have we got?

19:24.513 --> 19:26.496
Satellite shows the car should
be parked just around back.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.698
Let's move.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.704
Okay, let's hold up.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.779
Spike?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.681
I don't get it.
Tracker says it should be here.

19:45.919 --> 19:47.652
Spike!

19:47.654 --> 19:50.721
The car isn't, but the GPS is.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.757
He pulled it out
of the trunk.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.306
Leslie MacCoy?
It's the police.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.476
Leslie?

20:12.478 --> 20:14.545
We need to talk to you
about your father.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.594
(rustling)

20:29.596 --> 20:30.761
Leslie?

20:34.434 --> 20:35.533
Sir!

20:35.535 --> 20:36.701
Sir! It's the police!

20:36.703 --> 20:37.868
Whoa! Whoa!
What... what's going on?

20:37.870 --> 20:39.837
Who are you?
I'm John Dixon.

20:39.839 --> 20:40.671
I'm the super.

20:40.673 --> 20:41.739
Where's Leslie MacCoy?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.641
I don't-I don't know.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.509
I got a complaint
from downstairs

20:45.511 --> 20:46.744
saying water was coming in
from the ceiling,

20:46.746 --> 20:48.846
so I just...
I let-I let myself in.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.015
Have you seen Leslie?
No.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.317
No. But the front door was open,

20:53.319 --> 20:54.785
and the bathroom
faucet was running.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.721
When was that?

20:56.723 --> 20:58.389
About an hour ago.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.725
And, judging
by the amount of water,

21:00.727 --> 21:03.327
I'd say it had been
running a while.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.997
All right. We're going to need
some contact info on Leslie--

21:05.999 --> 21:07.498
employer, friends...

21:07.500 --> 21:09.533
I think she works
at a coffee shop on Fifth.

21:09.535 --> 21:10.635
I got that number

21:10.637 --> 21:11.869
in her file
downstairs.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.838
Get it, please.
Yeah.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.474
Employer hasn't heard from her?

21:16.476 --> 21:17.875
She never showed up

21:17.877 --> 21:18.843
for her shift this morning,
and they still haven't

21:18.845 --> 21:19.844
been able to reach her.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.513
Cell phone's still here.

21:22.515 --> 21:23.814
Four missed calls.

21:23.816 --> 21:24.799
JULES:
Hey, boss,

21:24.800 --> 21:25.783
it looks like
she left this place

21:25.785 --> 21:26.784
in a hurry, and my guess,

21:26.786 --> 21:28.753
it was not by choice.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.021
Leslie disappears the
same day Mac takes off

21:30.023 --> 21:31.673
with an escaped prisoner?

21:31.674 --> 21:33.324
Bit of a coincidence.
The only way Mac

21:33.326 --> 21:34.992
would do something
illegal is if by force,

21:34.994 --> 21:36.761
and I know he'd do anything
to protect Leslie.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.996
So somebody took his daughter
to twist his arm.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.731
I got a pretty good idea who.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.633
Head of Bedlam, Paul Bullard.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.408
Now, that's how you break.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.879
(phone rings)

21:54.881 --> 21:56.380
Yeah?

21:59.852 --> 22:01.919
It's him.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.755
You're late.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.891
Yeah, I know.
There was an accident.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.392
Accident? Is Jeremy okay?

22:08.394 --> 22:10.361
Yeah, he's-he's fine.

22:10.363 --> 22:11.729
I mean, he's lost
a lot of blood.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.364
He's gonna need a hospital.

22:13.366 --> 22:15.333
No, no, bring him over here.
I'll take care of him.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.367
I will, but listen, Paul,

22:16.369 --> 22:17.568
they know we're gone, all right?

22:17.570 --> 22:18.936
The police are looking for me.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.372
Then you better get him
over here or the deal is off.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.574
Let me talk to her.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.776
Are you giving me orders,
Officer?

22:25.778 --> 22:27.611
Paul, you want your nephew free,

22:27.613 --> 22:29.714
you let me talk to my daughter
right now.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.622
Now tell your daddy

22:38.624 --> 22:40.925
how well we're
taking care of you.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.126
Dad...

22:42.128 --> 22:44.061
Hey, sweetheart.

22:44.063 --> 22:46.630
Dad, I don't know
what's going on.

22:46.632 --> 22:48.733
It-it-it's okay, honey.
I'm handling it.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.134
It's gonna be okay.

22:50.136 --> 22:51.669
I'm so sorry, Dad.

22:51.671 --> 22:52.903
I'm so sorry.

22:52.905 --> 22:55.639
I stayed clean, I paid my debts.

22:55.641 --> 22:57.108
I don't know these guys,
I swear.

22:57.110 --> 22:59.777
I know, I know, honey.

22:59.779 --> 23:02.580
It's... it's not your fault.

23:02.582 --> 23:03.814
This is all my fault.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.151
You see,

23:07.153 --> 23:09.553
she's in good hands.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.655
Now I want Jeremy here
in exactly 20 minutes.

23:11.657 --> 23:14.725
20 minutes?
Look, Paul, I can't...

23:14.727 --> 23:16.627
Well, that's too bad.

23:16.628 --> 23:18.528
I mean, after all you've done
for your little girl,

23:18.531 --> 23:20.698
it would be a real shame
if she relapsed

23:20.700 --> 23:22.700
and accidentally O.D.'d.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.135
Paul, listen to me. Paul.

23:24.137 --> 23:26.003
Paul?

23:34.147 --> 23:35.746
Any sign of MacCoy?

23:35.748 --> 23:37.615
PARKER:
No, nothing so far.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.551
And nothing on the APB either.

23:40.553 --> 23:41.685
This guy just vanished.

23:41.687 --> 23:43.554
Guys, you need to see this.

23:43.556 --> 23:46.056
It's from the security camera
outside Leslie's building.

23:46.058 --> 23:48.192
JULES:
This was the only angle.

23:50.430 --> 23:53.464
SPIKE:
And nobody saw anything?

23:53.466 --> 23:55.166
JULES:
No one we talked to.

23:55.168 --> 23:57.168
Time stamp was 6:45
this morning.

23:57.170 --> 23:58.569
We sure it's
Bullard's people?

23:58.571 --> 24:00.504
JULES:
Not 100%.

24:00.506 --> 24:01.872
I got partial plates and...

24:02.842 --> 24:04.542
Right there.

24:04.544 --> 24:05.976
I recognize him from the file.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.945
John Delany.
PARKER:
AKA Big John.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.647
ED:
Big John.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.432
He's one of Bullard's
main lieutenants.

24:11.433 --> 24:13.216
So Bullard's people grabbed the
daughter before MacCoy's shift

24:13.219 --> 24:14.819
and forced him
to spring the nephew.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.153
WORDY:
But why target MacCoy

24:16.155 --> 24:18.456
and not the cop originally
assigned to the detail?

24:18.458 --> 24:20.057
And more important,
where'd they take the daughter?

24:21.894 --> 24:23.194
Hey, buddy, where is she?

24:24.163 --> 24:26.864
Where'd they take her?

24:26.866 --> 24:28.232
I'm asking you a question.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.568
Who knows, man. Who knows.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.803
Okay.

24:34.474 --> 24:35.573
(engine revving)

24:37.176 --> 24:39.210
(tires squealing)

24:39.946 --> 24:41.712
Hey, man, what the hell?

24:47.620 --> 24:48.953
What?

24:48.955 --> 24:50.788
Start talking!
I got nothing to say to you!

24:50.790 --> 24:53.491
Where's Leslie MacCoy?
Like I said, I got
nothing to say.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.009
Let me ask you this--

24:55.010 --> 24:56.526
how do you think Paul Bullard
is going to react

24:56.529 --> 24:59.029
when he finds out that you left
his nephew in a burning bus?

24:59.031 --> 25:00.498
Don't imagine he's going
to be very happy.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.800
Not happy at all.
That's not how it happened.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.268
Well, that is what
he's going to hear unless you

25:04.270 --> 25:06.270
tell us what we need to know.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.638
Now!

25:08.674 --> 25:10.274
I didn't know the whole plan.

25:10.276 --> 25:13.511
I did find out, that cop,
he was going to let us go.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.114
You know, we screwed up, man.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.582
Big.

25:18.584 --> 25:20.784
Jeremy, would you chill?

25:20.786 --> 25:22.786
You said it was going to
be a couple packages,

25:22.788 --> 25:24.655
not ten keys.

25:24.657 --> 25:27.157
Ten keys, man.
That's serious.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.559
It's going to be all right.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.995
No, man, it's not.

25:32.832 --> 25:35.599
I don't want to do
ten years, man.

25:35.601 --> 25:39.236
Yo, officer, you missed
the exit to lockup.

25:39.238 --> 25:42.640
You're not going back to lockup.

25:42.642 --> 25:44.708
And why not?

25:47.013 --> 25:49.313
Hey, I said why not?
Where are we going?

25:49.315 --> 25:53.250
Your Uncle Paul has arranged
for you to go away.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.819
You're getting out
of the country.
What?

25:55.821 --> 25:58.589
Hey, no way, man.

25:58.591 --> 26:01.592
Hey. No way, man!

26:01.594 --> 26:05.262
Hey! Hey! Turn us
back around! Hey!

26:05.264 --> 26:06.797
Hey, hey, just sit back...
(horn honking)

26:06.799 --> 26:08.566
Hey!
(tires squealing)

26:08.568 --> 26:10.935
When we landed,
the doors opened

26:10.937 --> 26:12.937
and that cop's out cold.

26:12.939 --> 26:16.707
So why was Jeremy afraid
to go see his uncle?

26:16.709 --> 26:20.311
That H we sold, it
wasn't exactly ours.

26:20.313 --> 26:22.296
It belonged to Paul Bullard.

26:22.297 --> 26:24.280
We found some other buyers
willing to pay more.

26:24.283 --> 26:26.116
We thought we'd show
Jeremy's Uncle Paul

26:26.118 --> 26:27.718
that we, you know,
had some savvy.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.687
And these other buyers
were cops.

26:29.689 --> 26:32.656
It was entrapment, man.
It was you being an idiot.

26:32.658 --> 26:35.092
Where's Paul Bullard now?
I swear, I don't know.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.795
I'm not high enough up on the
chain to know where they are.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.132
Know what?
I'm not buying it.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.867
All this so Bullard
can kick his nephew's ass

26:43.869 --> 26:45.202
before he sends him away?

26:45.204 --> 26:47.671
Bedlam doesn't mess around.

26:56.983 --> 26:58.649
Jeremy.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.284
Jeremy, stay awake!

27:06.692 --> 27:08.892
So we know Mac's taking Jeremy
to see Paul Bullard.

27:08.894 --> 27:11.095
And we can assume the daughter's
being held someplace secure.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.262
Winnie,

27:12.264 --> 27:13.697
contact Guns and Gangs.

27:13.699 --> 27:15.065
We need an updated list

27:15.067 --> 27:17.201
of any properties known to
belong to the Bedlam crew.

27:17.203 --> 27:18.970
Copy that.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.738
And, boss, I have something else
might be relevant.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.872
Go ahead.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.674
There's an I.A. file building

27:23.676 --> 27:26.010
against Sergeant MacCoy.
Internal affairs?

27:26.012 --> 27:27.645
What do they want with Mac?

27:27.647 --> 27:29.713
They said it involves
unusual bank activity.

27:29.715 --> 27:32.383
I.A. uncovered regular payments
from an investment company

27:32.385 --> 27:34.785
suspected of having ties
to the Bedlam gang.

27:35.755 --> 27:38.022
Thanks, Winnie.

27:38.024 --> 27:40.057
So that's why he didn't call
when Leslie was taken.

27:40.059 --> 27:41.925
He was afraid
we were going to find out

27:41.927 --> 27:44.345
he was working for Bullard.

27:44.346 --> 27:46.764
PARKER:
<i> Or he thought he could</i>
<i> take care of it himself</i>

27:46.766 --> 27:48.932
<i> before the accident.</i>

27:48.934 --> 27:51.301
When his wife was sick,
he flew her all over the country

27:51.303 --> 27:53.220
looking for treatment.

27:53.221 --> 27:55.138
<i> And then when he was trying</i>
<i> to help Leslie get clean--</i>

27:55.141 --> 27:57.708
<i> paying for rehab,</i>
<i> supporting her.</i>

27:57.710 --> 28:00.711
Why didn't I see it?
Because you always see

28:00.713 --> 28:02.846
the best in people, Scarlatti.

28:10.956 --> 28:14.158
Hey, kid.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.959
Come on, kid, stay awake.

28:15.961 --> 28:17.795
We're almost there.

28:28.140 --> 28:31.842
All right, Jeremy, wake up.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.016
Please, just let me go.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.784
Sorry, kid, I can't do that.

28:42.722 --> 28:43.754
(groans)

28:43.756 --> 28:45.756
That looks pretty bad.

28:45.758 --> 28:48.492
Please, I don't want to die.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.294
That's not going to happen.

28:50.296 --> 28:51.762
You're going to be okay.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.764
Do you promise?

28:53.766 --> 28:55.499
Promise?

28:55.501 --> 28:58.736
I'll tie it off.
Hold this.

28:58.738 --> 29:01.004
(yelling in pain)

29:01.006 --> 29:05.008
Now, look, I can loosen this up
when the bleeding stops,

29:05.010 --> 29:06.977
but you got to keep moving
the fingers in your hand.

29:06.979 --> 29:09.113
You got to keep the blood
in your hand going, all right?

29:09.115 --> 29:11.448
That's it. Good, good.

29:13.119 --> 29:16.353
Okay, it's got to be tight.

29:16.355 --> 29:17.755
(screaming)
One more.

29:17.757 --> 29:20.157
Come on, keep moving
those fingers. Show me.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.059
That's it. That's right.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.827
Okay, we got to go.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.932
WINNIE:
<i> Boss, Gangs Unit just sent me</i>

29:28.934 --> 29:31.468
a full list of addresses
known to be associated

29:31.470 --> 29:33.537
with Bedlam
or any of its members.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.439
I'm forwarding it to you now,

29:35.441 --> 29:38.308
but, boss, there's 50 places
on this list.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.844
We know he's headed downtown,
so we eliminate everything

29:40.846 --> 29:41.945
west of Kipling,
north of DuPont.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.280
That still leaves us
over 30 properties.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.948
Even if we split and get backup,

29:44.950 --> 29:47.184
there's no way we can
check them all in time.

29:47.186 --> 29:48.819
Boss, if we talk to Mac,

29:48.820 --> 29:50.453
we can tell him we know about
Leslie. He might let us help.

29:50.456 --> 29:52.856
Spike, he left his phone
so we couldn't track him.

29:52.858 --> 29:55.292
Right, and he disabled
the Journeypath GPS
for the same reason,

29:55.294 --> 29:57.060
but there's a chance he didn't
unhook the intercom--

29:57.062 --> 29:58.328
the one for roadside assistance.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.963
I might be able
to route a call

29:59.965 --> 30:01.865
directly through
the Journeypath server.

30:01.867 --> 30:03.267
Okay.
Okay?

30:10.009 --> 30:13.143
PARKER (intercom):
Sergeant MacCoy.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.846
Sergeant Oliver MacCoy.

30:15.848 --> 30:18.182
It's Greg Parker with the SRU.

30:22.221 --> 30:23.921
Mac, it's Spike.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.889
If you can hear me,
we know about Leslie.

30:25.891 --> 30:27.424
We want to help.

30:27.426 --> 30:30.093
We also know that you're
working for Bullard.

30:30.095 --> 30:31.995
That you're on his payroll.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.897
Internal affairs has been
building a file.

30:33.899 --> 30:35.165
They've been tracing payments.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.000
Unless you tell me otherwise,

30:37.002 --> 30:39.136
unless you tell me Bullard's
just trying to frame you,

30:39.138 --> 30:41.138
trying to make it look like
you did something wrong,

30:41.140 --> 30:42.406
if you tell me that, Mac,

30:42.408 --> 30:44.408
I'm going to believe you.

30:46.612 --> 30:49.279
Mac, please.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.882
Spike, you got to know
I'd never do anything

30:51.884 --> 30:54.351
that would get anybody hurt.

30:54.353 --> 30:57.120
It was just information.

30:57.122 --> 30:58.622
One of their places
was going to get hit,

30:58.624 --> 31:00.858
a Bedlam member was going
to get picked up,

31:00.860 --> 31:02.410
I'd let 'em know, that's it.

31:02.411 --> 31:03.961
I never meant for any of this
to happen.

31:06.432 --> 31:07.931
Mac, you took an oath.

31:07.933 --> 31:09.032
I spent every penny

31:09.034 --> 31:11.034
I had trying to save Rosie,

31:11.036 --> 31:14.238
and she died anyway.

31:14.240 --> 31:18.375
I couldn't face losing
my little girl, Spike.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.644
I had to do something
to take care of her.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.279
But this?
Letting two convicts go?

31:22.281 --> 31:24.915
How'd you think you were going
to get away with that?

31:24.917 --> 31:26.516
A couple guys overpower me
while I'm getting gas.

31:26.518 --> 31:27.918
Who's gonna blame me?

31:27.920 --> 31:30.287
Besides, when Bullard
asked me to do this,

31:30.289 --> 31:32.322
of course I said no, of course.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.658
But I had no choice.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.928
Dad, I don't know
what's going on.

31:39.431 --> 31:42.065
I'm so sorry, Dad.
I'm so sorry.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.934
He's got my little girl, Spike.

31:43.936 --> 31:45.469
You know she's my whole world.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.939
Let us help you.

31:48.941 --> 31:51.041
Tell us where you're
meeting Bullard, okay?

31:51.043 --> 31:53.977
We'll back you up.

31:56.048 --> 31:57.948
Triangle Lounge, Queen Street.

31:57.950 --> 32:00.317
Triangle Lounge on Queen Street.
You got that?

32:00.319 --> 32:01.418
On our way.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.220
Copy.
(siren wailing)

32:03.221 --> 32:05.021
Okay, hold on. Our team can
be there in ten minutes.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.257
I can't do that. I got to get
the kid there in less than five

32:07.259 --> 32:09.092
or Bullard's going
to kill my girl.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.161
(siren wailing)

32:11.163 --> 32:14.431
I'll drop the kid off.
I'll give him to his uncle.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.133
I'll make sure Leslie's okay.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.935
I'll try to stall Bullard
as long as I can

32:17.937 --> 32:19.436
till your team gets there.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.571
All right, Mac. Okay, Mac.
It's going to be okay, okay?

32:21.573 --> 32:23.340
She's going to be okay.
I got your back.

32:23.342 --> 32:26.009
(sirens wailing)

32:38.223 --> 32:41.124
All right, I'm here on time.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.226
Were you followed?
No.

32:43.228 --> 32:45.562
Give me a hand with him.

32:45.564 --> 32:46.630
Give me your gun.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.299
Your gun.

32:51.971 --> 32:53.537
All right, take it.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.138
Just give me a hand
getting him inside.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.406
Put him in my truck.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.041
We got to take him
to see Bullard.

32:58.043 --> 33:00.143
What? Where's Bullard?

33:00.145 --> 33:01.144
He's not here.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.612
Where's my daughter?

33:02.614 --> 33:04.481
Don't worry. She's safe.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.616
You can have her back after
you get the kid to his uncle.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.220
All right. Come on, kid.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.990
(Jeremy groans)

33:14.994 --> 33:16.326
(door closes)

33:16.328 --> 33:18.662
Get in the truck.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.204
(man coughing)
MAN: Come on. It's your turn.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.272
(thumping)

33:31.176 --> 33:32.576
Ronnie, go check that out.

33:47.526 --> 33:48.759
(muffled cry)

33:52.765 --> 33:54.431
Ronnie?

33:54.433 --> 33:57.334
Yo, Ronnie!

34:04.276 --> 34:06.743
SRU!
SRU! Put down the weapon!

34:06.745 --> 34:08.512
Get the ground!
Drop down!

34:08.514 --> 34:11.248
(all shouting indistinctly)

34:11.250 --> 34:13.083
Get on the ground!
Get down!

34:13.085 --> 34:14.084
Hands behind your back!

34:14.086 --> 34:15.836
LESLIE:
Spike!

34:15.837 --> 34:17.587
Leslie! Leslie! It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.356
Where's your dad?
I don't know.
He never showed up.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.725
Boss! Mac never showed up.

34:21.727 --> 34:22.759
Where's Bullard?

34:23.462 --> 34:25.195
Where's Bullard?!

34:25.197 --> 34:28.265
One last time, where did they
take Jeremy Bullard?

34:28.267 --> 34:29.366
I don't know, man.

34:29.368 --> 34:30.834
Haven't seen the little snitch.

34:30.836 --> 34:32.302
(man grunts)

34:32.304 --> 34:33.336
Snitch?

34:39.244 --> 34:41.545
Jeremy. Over here.
Bring him over here.

34:41.547 --> 34:42.679
(Jeremy groans in pain)

34:42.681 --> 34:44.347
He's lost
a lot of blood.

34:44.349 --> 34:46.083
I stopped
the bleeding,

34:46.085 --> 34:47.250
but he's going
to need a doctor soon.

34:47.252 --> 34:51.354
Sure. Of course.

34:51.356 --> 34:53.457
There you go.

34:53.459 --> 34:55.392
(groans)

34:55.394 --> 34:56.359
That better?

34:56.361 --> 34:57.627
Yeah.
Good.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.296
We're gonna get you
taken care of.

34:59.298 --> 35:00.730
Okay, kid?

35:00.732 --> 35:03.366
First, I have
a few questions to ask you.

35:06.371 --> 35:09.306
Nobody's saying anything
about where Bullard is.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.408
Staff Sergeant from 52 Division
says Jeremy was down there

35:11.410 --> 35:12.542
with his lawyer
and the prosecutor.

35:12.544 --> 35:14.428
He cut a deal.

35:14.429 --> 35:16.313
Reduced sentence for
testimony against his uncle.

35:16.315 --> 35:18.515
And somehow,
Bullard found out.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.684
He's not planning to send Jeremy
out of the country.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.385
Hey, boss.

35:22.387 --> 35:24.387
A uniform on a drive-by
reported seeing that truck

35:24.389 --> 35:25.589
from a security camera.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.290
Where?
Outside a garage,

35:27.292 --> 35:30.193
other end of the waterfront.

35:30.195 --> 35:31.595
Spike!
Barry!

35:31.597 --> 35:33.697
Leslie, it's okay. It's going
to be all right, okay?

35:33.699 --> 35:37.367
So, we both know
you got something to tell me.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.202
So let's clear the air,

35:39.204 --> 35:40.570
and we can move on, yes?

35:43.275 --> 35:45.208
Uncle Paul...

35:45.210 --> 35:46.443
It's okay, kid.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.278
Just say it.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.516
Paul, he needs a doctor.

35:52.517 --> 35:54.351
Tell me, and it's all
going to be good.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.853
(panting)

35:56.855 --> 35:58.421
The heroin...

35:58.423 --> 35:59.789
I'm sorry.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.625
I don't care about the heroin.

36:01.627 --> 36:03.793
Just tell me about the cops.

36:03.795 --> 36:06.296
You met again with
them this morning.

36:06.298 --> 36:08.331
Didn't you?
To cut a deal?

36:08.333 --> 36:10.800
What did you say?

36:12.571 --> 36:14.504
I didn't want to do ten years.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.473
What did you tell them?

36:16.475 --> 36:19.342
Just about the containers.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.777
And the shipments
from Boston.

36:20.779 --> 36:22.279
But that's it.

36:22.281 --> 36:24.447
I swear to God,
that's it.

36:24.449 --> 36:26.416
You see,
that was easy.

36:26.418 --> 36:29.419
That's all I needed to know.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.888
Now John over here
is going to take you out

36:31.890 --> 36:33.423
for a little ride,
get you all sorted out.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.258
Uncle Paul?

36:35.260 --> 36:36.459
Paul, just...

36:36.461 --> 36:38.195
let him go, like you said.

36:38.197 --> 36:40.764
Giving me orders
again, Officer?

36:40.766 --> 36:42.332
Stay out of this.
Uncle Paul, please.

36:42.334 --> 36:44.301
I'm sorry. I didn't
have a choice.

36:44.303 --> 36:45.468
Please.
You're done.

36:45.470 --> 36:46.503
Uncle Paul!
Finish it.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.339
Hey.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.508
Big mistake, MacCoy.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.310
Yeah, I know.

36:53.312 --> 36:55.445
It's one I made
a long time ago.

36:55.447 --> 36:58.582
(gunshots)

37:11.396 --> 37:13.363
Put the guns down
right now!

37:13.365 --> 37:14.531
SRU!
(indistinct shouting)

37:14.533 --> 37:16.967
Hands in the air!
Get down!

37:16.969 --> 37:19.336
Put the gun down!
Stay right there!

37:19.338 --> 37:20.270
Put the gun down!
Stay right there!

37:20.272 --> 37:21.705
Don't move!
Go, go, go.

37:21.707 --> 37:22.872
Stay.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.274
Don't move a muscle.

37:24.276 --> 37:27.911
JEREMY:
Over here! We need help!

37:29.014 --> 37:30.313
Mac!

37:30.315 --> 37:31.715
Officer down.

37:31.717 --> 37:34.451
Officer down! We need
medics in here right now!

37:34.453 --> 37:35.903
Leslie?

37:35.904 --> 37:37.354
We got her. We got her.
She's okay, okay?

37:37.356 --> 37:38.355
You just hang on.

37:38.357 --> 37:39.589
(groans)

37:39.591 --> 37:42.993
SRU. Swoop in for all the glory.

37:42.995 --> 37:44.394
(coughing)

37:44.396 --> 37:45.562
Spike?

37:45.564 --> 37:48.531
You got to take care of Leslie.

37:48.533 --> 37:49.911
See that she's
going to be okay.

37:49.912 --> 37:51.290
You're going to do that
yourself, okay?

37:51.291 --> 37:52.669
As soon as you feel better.

37:52.671 --> 37:55.438
Spike, promise me
she won't be alone.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.641
I'll do what I can.

37:57.643 --> 37:59.409
(strained):
Promise.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.577
I promise.

38:00.579 --> 38:02.879
I promise!

38:02.881 --> 38:04.347
(wheezing and coughing)

38:04.349 --> 38:06.383
(coughing)

38:06.385 --> 38:07.517
Mac?

38:07.519 --> 38:09.619
(wheezing)
Mac?

38:09.621 --> 38:11.788
(wheezing stops)

38:11.790 --> 38:13.857
Mac!

38:17.496 --> 38:19.562
(gentle music plays)

38:42.788 --> 38:44.854
¶ ¶

39:01.039 --> 39:05.675
¶ I could be sold
in an instant ¶

39:09.014 --> 39:12.782
¶ I could be saved in the same ¶

39:16.755 --> 39:23.393
¶ I could live in a lifetime ¶

39:24.663 --> 39:28.732
¶ I could die in a day ¶

39:32.804 --> 39:34.671
¶ It could be fading... ¶

39:34.673 --> 39:35.839
You should take some time.

39:35.841 --> 39:38.641
He was a good cop.

39:38.643 --> 39:40.577
Yes.

39:40.578 --> 39:42.512
That's why when he saw
a young man facing execution,

39:42.514 --> 39:45.132
he did something about it.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.751
You know why he was able
to do something like that?

39:47.753 --> 39:50.653
Because he knew
you had his back.

39:50.655 --> 39:53.723
He knew you'd be there
for his daughter.

39:53.725 --> 39:57.060
You know what else that guy did?

39:57.062 --> 39:58.795
What?

39:58.797 --> 40:04.000
He taught you everything you
know about being a good cop.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.169
And you're one of the best
I've ever known.

40:06.171 --> 40:12.008
¶ Full of creatures
both wicked and wild... ¶

40:12.010 --> 40:13.943
(knocking on door)

40:13.945 --> 40:15.712
Hey.
Hey.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.447
That's it.

40:17.449 --> 40:19.649
That's the last of your
dad's stuff from the station.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.684
And I'll come by tomorrow
after shift,

40:21.686 --> 40:23.686
and I'll help you clear out
the rest from his place.

40:23.688 --> 40:25.655
You don't have to, Spike.
I can handle it.

40:25.657 --> 40:27.056
I know, but you're going

40:27.058 --> 40:28.858
to be seeing a lot more
of me from now on.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.660
So you'd better
get used to it.

40:30.662 --> 40:33.196
¶ Full of creatures ¶

40:33.198 --> 40:34.831
Thanks.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.966
¶ Both wicked and wild... ¶

40:36.968 --> 40:39.736
You're welcome.

40:39.738 --> 40:42.705
Um, I need
to show you something.

40:44.709 --> 40:48.745
¶ Thanksgiving one... ¶

40:48.747 --> 40:51.748
I found this when I was
packing up my dad's place.

40:51.750 --> 40:54.451
¶ Who knows what we've done ¶

40:54.453 --> 40:57.487
¶ Another revolution ¶

40:57.489 --> 40:59.856
He followed your whole career.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.891
¶ Of the sun ¶

41:01.893 --> 41:04.594
Look.
