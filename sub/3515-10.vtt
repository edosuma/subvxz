00:01.000 --> 00:02.331
NICK: Previously on Grimm...

00:02.400 --> 00:03.526
So what happened to you?

00:03.600 --> 00:05.125
Zip-lining in Kauai.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.401
Tore my Achilles.

00:06.600 --> 00:09.251
Well, one more session
and we should be done.

00:09.840 --> 00:10.921
One more, really?

00:11.080 --> 00:13.048
Maybe we should celebrate.
No. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

00:13.280 --> 00:15.601
I try to keep everything
on a professional...

00:15.680 --> 00:17.444
Right. That's always good.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.887
I gotta get out of here, okay?
I can't take it anymore.

00:19.960 --> 00:21.720
You need to come,
and you're staying with us.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.410
JULIETTE: My friend Alicia
just called.

00:23.480 --> 00:24.766
She needs a place to stay.

00:24.840 --> 00:25.921
He hit her again.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.411
This isn't your fault, you know.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.411
If he knows that I'm here,
then he will come here.

00:30.560 --> 00:32.005
He's not normal.

00:35.320 --> 00:36.321
(GROWLS)

00:52.960 --> 00:56.248
What are you gonna do if Joe apologizes?
What then?

00:56.920 --> 00:59.287
I'm not going back this time.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.610
I don't care what
he does or he says.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.491
Isn't that what
you said last time?

01:04.599 --> 01:06.011
I know.

01:06.680 --> 01:09.411
But I didn't walk
out last time either.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.281
Sorry I'm late.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.690
You want some wine?

01:17.760 --> 01:19.728
I do, but still on duty.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.605
How you doing?

01:22.680 --> 01:24.967
Pretty good, thanks to you two.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.642
It sort of feels like
we're back in the dorm, right?

01:27.720 --> 01:29.688
Yeah.
Except for Nick, of course.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.564
Aw, I wish he'd been there.

01:31.640 --> 01:32.846
Yeah, if only.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.327
Some of the guys that she was with...
Hey! Whoa!

01:35.400 --> 01:37.402
(LAUGHING)
You need to behave yourself.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.880
Maybe it's time I go to
the little girls' room.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.367
That's a good idea.
I think so.

01:44.680 --> 01:47.081
Thanks for coming by.
I know you're crazed at work.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.241
Yeah.

01:48.680 --> 01:51.445
She was kidding
about the guys, mostly.

01:51.520 --> 01:55.127
No, I have something to
tell you about Alicia.

01:56.560 --> 01:57.891
Is it Joe? Is he here?

01:58.000 --> 01:59.206
No. No.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.407
Your friend is a Wesen.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.846
What?

02:08.600 --> 02:10.000
I saw her when she
got to our house.

02:11.039 --> 02:12.769
You were in the other room.
She got upset.

02:12.840 --> 02:15.969
No. No way. We were
roommates for three years.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.566
I don't even know if I
should be telling you this.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.644
What kind of Wesen?
Is she dangerous?

02:20.760 --> 02:22.410
No. I don't think so.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.404
I didn't get a good look at her,

02:24.560 --> 02:26.289
but I'd say something
more like a Fuchsbau.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.046
Like Rosalee? That's a relief.

02:29.400 --> 02:33.166
Look, she's your friend. She can
stay with us as long as she wants.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.811
But if she finds out that I'm
a Grimm, she could freak out.

02:35.880 --> 02:38.008
She could go
running back to Joe.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.003
Well, what do we do now?
Nothing.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.969
Okay? Nothing.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.405
Act natural.

02:55.360 --> 02:56.361
(SIGHS)

02:58.440 --> 02:59.566
What?

03:14.640 --> 03:15.926
Let me see.
No.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.691
(CHUCKLES) You're gonna get fired
if you keep coming over here.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.007
Well, keep ordering food,
and I'm good.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.845
I don't have any more money.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.091
Can you stay till I close?

03:26.600 --> 03:27.761
I have my sister's car.

03:28.360 --> 03:29.885
If she finds out,
she's gonna kill you.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.570
I know.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.889
Your boss is looking.

03:37.160 --> 03:40.243
Look, my mom's in Vegas with
some loser for the weekend.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.606
We have the house to ourselves.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.731
Just saying.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.171
Thank you.

04:22.360 --> 04:25.204
WOMAN: Help! Stop!
(MAN GRUNTING)

04:25.280 --> 04:26.805

(GROANS)

04:42.200 --> 04:43.201
Hey!

04:49.000 --> 04:50.684
Come on, let's go!

04:51.200 --> 04:52.720
MUGGER: All right,
let's bounce, y'all.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.049
Slow down, you idiot!

05:09.320 --> 05:10.560
WOMAN: Help me!

05:10.800 --> 05:12.802
CUSTOMER: Oh, my God.
WOMAN: Help me!

05:14.360 --> 05:15.566
(SOBBING) Help me.

05:16.760 --> 05:17.921
I'll be right back.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.244
Help me!

05:22.360 --> 05:23.361
(SCREAMS)

05:37.360 --> 05:38.566
WU: We've got two victims.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.042
The female, being rushed to the
hospital, male, not so lucky.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.526
HANK: Any cameras in
the parking lot?

05:43.640 --> 05:44.926
Place barely has lights.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.050
Female talking
when they found her?

05:47.200 --> 05:48.850
In and out of consciousness.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.405
Alonzo Banks.

05:57.480 --> 06:00.768
Didn't take his
cash or his jewelry.

06:02.040 --> 06:05.010
Owner said he was a regular. Came
in on the weekends, a high roller.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.288
He and his date were
seen leaving the diner,

06:07.360 --> 06:10.125
found minutes later
by a customer walking out.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.281
I'll check inside.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.568
CUSTOMER: I saw him hauling ass across
the parking lot just as I walked out.

06:16.640 --> 06:20.247
He was parked right over here.
Young, black kid, late teens.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.606
Didn't get a good
look at his face.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.170
Was he with anybody?
Not that I saw.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.766
Almost ran me down
getting out of here.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.080
You get a look at the vehicle?

06:27.160 --> 06:29.731
Yeah.
Silver Impala, pretty new.

06:29.800 --> 06:34.203
I got an eye for wheels. Had a
1970 Impala Coupe, real beauty.

06:34.280 --> 06:36.806
Didn't happen to get a look
at the license, did you?

06:36.880 --> 06:39.565
Yeah, saw half.
6-S-M something.

06:39.640 --> 06:40.687
6SM.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.008
Did you know Alonzo Banks
or the girl he was with?

06:44.360 --> 06:46.806
Just to wait on. They pretty
much kept to themselves.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.167
Did he seem upset, get into
an argument with anyone?

06:49.240 --> 06:50.571
Not that I saw.

06:50.680 --> 06:51.960
Anything else
you know about him?

06:54.400 --> 06:55.811
What?

06:55.920 --> 06:57.285
Just he wasn't
a guy to mess with.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.001
You know, maybe involved
in a gang or something,

07:00.080 --> 07:03.562
but I don't know anything about that.
I just do my job.

07:03.880 --> 07:04.927
(CELL PHONE RINGTONE PLAYING)

07:05.000 --> 07:06.001
Sorry.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.005
Do you mind if I get this?
It's my boyfriend.

07:09.160 --> 07:10.571
He's probably
wondering where I am.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.010
Go ahead.
Thanks.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.206
Hey, are you home?

07:16.320 --> 07:17.845
Got a hit on something.
All right.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.604
JOY: You're not gonna believe
what happened after you left.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.011
I saw it.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.281
(SIGHS)

07:22.360 --> 07:23.885
I saw what they did, Joy.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.923
I saw them kill that guy.
What?

07:26.560 --> 07:27.721
And they saw me.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.326
Oh, my God. Are you sure?

07:29.520 --> 07:31.602
Yes, I'm sure.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.006
I don't know what to do.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.451
Don't talk to anybody.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.045
Look,
Alonzo was a bad man, Jared,

07:36.120 --> 07:38.327
which means that
whoever killed him is worse.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.771
Should I go to the cops?

07:39.880 --> 07:41.166
You think they'll be
able to protect you?

07:41.240 --> 07:44.483
That's not how it works,
not in this neighborhood.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.200
I'll call you
when I get back home.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.570
KAI: He ain't
gonna say nothing.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.769
He saw our faces.

07:54.840 --> 07:58.322
He was talking with the waitress in
the diner. They had something going.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.925
ENDO: Dread, come on.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.527
You think a scared little punk
like that is going to the cops?

08:02.600 --> 08:03.931
I don't know what he's gonna do.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.568
But I know what we're gonna do.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.767
Morning.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.488
How'd you sleep?
Oh, good, for once.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.847
Oh, I found some apartments online.
Really affordable too.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.922
Oh, hey, that's great.
Yeah.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.049
Oh! Uh...

08:33.120 --> 08:36.919
Coffee? Did you want
to drink some coffee?

08:37.640 --> 08:39.448
Sure. I'd love some.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.807
You okay? Sure. Um... (CHUCKLES)

08:42.880 --> 08:44.803
Sorry. I, uh...

08:44.920 --> 08:47.082
Coffee. I'm... Make some.

08:52.320 --> 08:56.370
Look, you know, I should find
something today, so I'll...

08:56.440 --> 08:57.487
I'll be out of your hair.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.920
Look, we've known each other
for a really long time,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.721
and we've always been able to be really
open and honest with each other.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.041
And I just...

09:11.120 --> 09:13.043
I kind of think that, um...

09:13.480 --> 09:14.845
What? What?

09:16.040 --> 09:18.168
I just think that, um...

09:18.240 --> 09:20.447
Well... (CHUCKLES)

09:20.520 --> 09:21.806
I don't really
know how to say this.

09:21.880 --> 09:25.168
It's not easy to say,
so I just come out with it.

09:26.160 --> 09:31.291
I am a
Kehrseite-Schlich-Kennen.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.924
That's German for someone
who isn't but knows.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.001
Knows what?

09:37.080 --> 09:38.081
What you are.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.011
What are you talking about?

09:40.120 --> 09:41.451
I know that you're Wesen.

09:42.560 --> 09:45.609
And it just... It's not
a problem for me at all.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.763
So I just want you to know
that I'm totally okay with it.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.241
But I don't want
you to feel like this

09:51.400 --> 09:53.767
is something that you
need to hide from me.

09:53.840 --> 09:56.571
Look, I don't...
I don't know what you mean.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.361
I think you do.

09:58.480 --> 09:59.561
You know what?

10:00.040 --> 10:02.407
I have enough
problems right now, okay?

10:02.480 --> 10:04.926
Obviously, I did
something to make you mad

10:05.080 --> 10:07.481
or to make you think
that I'm lying to you...

10:07.560 --> 10:08.607
No, that's not it.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.205
But whatever it is,
I'm just gonna walk away now

10:10.280 --> 10:11.930
before one of us says
something we regret.

10:12.760 --> 10:13.886
Okay.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.728
HANK: Alonzo Banks did six years on
an assault and possessions charge.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.446
Guy allegedly ran
Portland's Northend Crew.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.727
I busted a Northend
banger a few years back.

10:22.800 --> 10:23.961
Not a gang you
want to mess with.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.560
Unless you're
trying to send a message.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.643
Rival gang hit?
Could be.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.882
I could check with the gang task
force, see if they know your vic.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.041
(KNOCKING)

10:31.280 --> 10:32.566
Yeah?

10:32.640 --> 10:34.449
I got three cars that
match the description

10:34.560 --> 10:36.403
and plate numbers of
the suspect's vehicle.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.803
You run them? I was about to.
Then I got this.

10:40.320 --> 10:44.006
Payback for the millions spent
on the red light camera program.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.451
Silver Impala was seen

10:45.520 --> 10:47.727
running a red light two
blocks from the crime scene

10:47.800 --> 10:50.246
less than a minute
after the 911 call was made.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.727
Coincidence? I believe not.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.241
We know the owner?

10:54.360 --> 10:55.560
Registered to
a Tyler Z. Ellis.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.929
Let's see what
Mr. Ellis has to say.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.882
ZURI: Who is it?
It's the Portland PD.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.247
We're looking for Tyler Ellis.

11:22.880 --> 11:23.927
Hank.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.406
Zuri?

11:27.640 --> 11:29.847
What are you doing here?
You two know each other.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.651
Zuri was my physical therapist
for my Achilles.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.484
Zuri,
this is Detective Burkhardt.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.520
So what are you doing here?

11:36.600 --> 11:37.601
(CHUCKLES)

11:37.720 --> 11:40.326
There must be some mistake. We're
looking for a Tyler Ellis.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.889
I'm Tyler.

11:42.960 --> 11:46.601
I go by my middle name. It's
a family thing. Long story.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.284
Is that your
silver Impala out front?

11:48.440 --> 11:50.044
Last time I looked, yeah.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.884
You want to tell me
what this is about?

11:51.960 --> 11:54.840
Well, we think your car was seen leaving
the scene of a crime last night.

Jared lives with me.

you were last night.

running the red light last night.

can't tie him to the crime scene.

last night without her knowing?

Where'd you go?

He was in Ray's.

No.

What about in the parking lot?
You see him there?

15:11.560 --> 15:12.686
I didn't see anything.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.208
Somebody beat this man to death.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.880
You didn't hear him scream? You
didn't hear his girlfriend scream?

15:21.680 --> 15:23.808
A customer saw you leave, Jared.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.601
You were there when it happened.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.286
Who killed Alonzo, Jared?
If it wasn't you, who was it?

15:28.360 --> 15:31.762
I don't know, they were gone
by the time I got there.

Yeah, of course he's scared.
You arrested him.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.963
He saw something.
Did he tell you?

16:11.480 --> 16:13.721
No. I didn't even
know he was gone.

16:16.720 --> 16:17.721

16:17.800 --> 16:20.041
Alonzo Banks, a known
gang member, was killed

16:20.560 --> 16:21.800
in the parking lot
outside of Ray's Diner

16:21.880 --> 16:23.166
the same time your brother left.

Now, we know he didn't have
anything to do with the murder,

16:25.080 --> 16:27.287
but we think he may
have seen something.

him, you need to let him go.

We'll let him go, but I want
you to know this is not over.

Yes, I have.

of Wesen apparently.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.882
Northend Crew are all Yaguarete.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.288
And you know this because?

18:43.200 --> 18:45.961
I used to buy drugs from them when I
was going through my rough patch.

Seventh Street don't mix.

never comes to Portland.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.611

letting Northend know they're here.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.400
No, come on in.
Juliette, what's going on?

25:08.440 --> 25:10.761
Hey, I kind of need some advice.
Do you have a minute?

25:12.080 --> 25:13.127
Mmm-hmm.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.129
Okay. Whoa.
Girl talk.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.528
Guess I'll practice.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.843
If Alicia told you she was Wesen
before you knew about Wesen,

25:20.920 --> 25:23.207
you would have
thought she was crazy.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.691
She was protecting
your friendship.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.331
No, I know that.
I really do, but...

25:29.000 --> 25:32.925
It is just so weird. I mean,
I have known her forever.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.891
And now that I do know, I want
her to know that it's all right.

25:36.960 --> 25:41.249
Look, it's not that easy to admit
being Wesen, even to Wesen.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.003
I did everything I
could to deny what I was.

25:44.560 --> 25:48.531
I hid it, hung out
with all the wrong people.

25:49.760 --> 25:53.321
You have no idea how badly
you just want to be normal.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.883
How do I convince
her that it's okay?

25:57.960 --> 25:59.405
Just be patient.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.480
She needs to know that your
friendship comes first.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.166
You don't realize how
different you and Nick

26:05.280 --> 26:07.647
and Hank are,
that you don’t judge.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.769
Or, more importantly,
cut off our heads.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.729
I'm just
beginning to realize that.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.205
How long do we
have to stay here?

26:23.640 --> 26:25.688
Until we catch these guys.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.604
Jared, sorry. No phones.

26:27.680 --> 26:28.681
What? Why?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.889
Your safety.
You'll get it back.

26:33.640 --> 26:34.971
Yours too.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.043
Cars are in place.
Anything else you need?

26:42.200 --> 26:43.201
We're good.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.730
Looks pretty comfy.
Who wants a coffee?

26:46.800 --> 26:48.643
I got this.
Oh. Great.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.722
Large latte, two Splenda, and...

26:50.800 --> 26:53.565
No, Wu, you're going home.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.330
I'm staying here.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.721
I don't feel
right about leaving.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.486
Little late for coffee anyway.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.885
So, I'll let you get settled.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.651
Thank you.

27:21.520 --> 27:22.601
Yeah.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.928
Endo and me are going back
for that punk tomorrow.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.320
No, you're not.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.890
You're lucky you got out.

27:47.680 --> 27:50.081
Nobody's going
back for that kid.

27:51.160 --> 27:53.128
That kid's coming to us.

28:01.240 --> 28:02.321
(WHIMPERING)

28:02.400 --> 28:03.561

28:16.720 --> 28:17.721
Jared?

28:20.440 --> 28:21.601
Come on!

28:21.840 --> 28:23.569
Want some?
(HANK LAUGHS)

28:26.400 --> 28:27.526
Morning.

28:27.640 --> 28:29.244
You know, your
brother is destroying me.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.765
Yes, lam.

28:31.280 --> 28:33.521
I made some coffee.
Help yourself.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.527
Oh, no! Come on, man!

28:38.640 --> 28:39.766
Yeah! Whoo!

28:40.120 --> 28:41.645
Man, I'm too old for this.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.961
Yeah, you old. You old.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.771
Um... Can I order room service?
I'm kind of hungry.

28:46.960 --> 28:49.088
Yeah, there's a take-out menu
on the table in your room.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.525
Just write down what you want.
We'll go get it.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.086
Anything I want?

28:52.320 --> 28:53.321
Yeah, pretty much.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.401
Okay.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.249
You been doing your exercises?

29:09.480 --> 29:12.324
For my Achilles,
absolutely. Um...

29:13.320 --> 29:17.245
Pointing, flexing, and, um...

29:19.800 --> 29:20.800
No, not so much.

29:20.840 --> 29:21.841
Shame on you.

29:21.920 --> 29:25.367
Look, I know,
but it's doing fine. See?

29:26.000 --> 29:27.001
Um...

29:28.440 --> 29:29.680
Look, uh...

29:30.480 --> 29:33.131
I'm sorry you have
to go through this.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.841
Jared's a good kid.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.201
Yeah...

29:37.560 --> 29:40.882
There are times I just want
to strangle him, but, um...

29:41.640 --> 29:43.880
Then I just try to remember
everything he's gone through.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.128
Yeah. I, um...

29:47.200 --> 29:48.326
I read your dad's file.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.645
Yeah, my dad.

29:51.720 --> 29:54.485
He had a hard time
with his temper

29:54.560 --> 29:57.245
and with drinking,
especially after my mom died.

29:57.760 --> 30:00.127
It finally got him in trouble.

30:00.480 --> 30:01.686
I'm so sorry.

30:01.760 --> 30:05.321
And Jared and I,
we both have his temper,

30:05.400 --> 30:08.882
which is why I'm trying to
teach him how to deal with it.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.487
He's lucky to have you.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.050
Let me ask you a question.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.690
Okay.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.000
Why are you here?

30:24.400 --> 30:26.801
I thought the sergeant was
supposed to spend the night.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.247
I, uh...

30:32.680 --> 30:34.480
Just wanted to make sure
everything went well.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.170
So far, so good.

30:39.440 --> 30:40.487
Is this okay?

30:42.800 --> 30:44.160
HANK: This better be
for all of us.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.771
Oh...

30:45.840 --> 30:47.040
You guys wanted something too?

30:47.080 --> 30:48.764
(CHUCKLING)

30:56.280 --> 30:57.327
Hey.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.520
What time did you
get in last night?

30:59.600 --> 31:02.331
Ugh. Late.
Didn't want to wake you.

31:03.560 --> 31:06.131
I wish you had. I, um...

31:07.040 --> 31:08.610
I told Alicia that I knew.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.088
That she was a Wesen?
Yeah.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.000
Well, how'd she take that?

31:16.320 --> 31:20.644
So badly. But, you know, I
talked to Rosalee about it.

31:20.720 --> 31:21.846
Okay, what did she say?

31:21.920 --> 31:25.606
She said to just be patient. Alicia's
just not comfortable coming out yet.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.642
Coming out?
You know what I mean.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.406
So I've just decided to just
let things unfold naturally.

31:32.480 --> 31:34.323
Okay. Here she comes.
(STAIRS CLATTERING)

31:38.480 --> 31:40.369
Morning.
Good morning.

31:40.960 --> 31:41.961
Morning.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.846
I, uh...
I found an apartment.

31:47.240 --> 31:48.605
Ah! That's great.

31:48.880 --> 31:50.848
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.644
So, look, I just
wanted to thank you both

31:54.720 --> 31:56.449
for everything that you've done,

31:56.840 --> 32:00.686
taking me in at a moment's notice
and just being there for me.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.000
You both have been
really good friends, so...

32:04.520 --> 32:06.204
I owe you a lot.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.084
This is ridiculous.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.366
Juliette, no.

32:09.440 --> 32:12.046
No, Nick.
I mean, I know what she is.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.645
You know what she is.
She knows what she is.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.165
Oh, my God, you are
not doing this again.

32:15.240 --> 32:17.686
I'm just saying you don't
have to pretend with us.

32:17.760 --> 32:18.841
We know a lot of Wesen.

32:18.920 --> 32:21.526
Juliette, you don't know
what you're talking about.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.722
I do know what
I'm talking about.

32:23.800 --> 32:24.926
Nick is a Grimm.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.326
No.

32:31.440 --> 32:32.726
JULIETTE: Nick, is she...

32:32.800 --> 32:33.847
No, no, no.

32:33.960 --> 32:35.450
Alicia, no, don't worry.
Alicia, wait, no, please...

32:35.680 --> 32:37.045
NICK: I'm not like
you think I am.

32:37.160 --> 32:38.446
No, no.

32:38.560 --> 32:39.766
No, Alicia!

32:39.840 --> 32:41.285
I've got her.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.761
Alicia! Alicia! It's okay.

32:44.040 --> 32:46.042
No, look, it's okay.

32:46.360 --> 32:49.489
Okay, I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm the
same Nick that you've always known.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.200
Joe!

32:52.280 --> 32:54.248
Alicia.
No!

32:54.760 --> 32:55.761
Hey!

32:57.240 --> 32:58.730
Stay out of it.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.802
You're coming back
home where you belong.

33:07.080 --> 33:08.127

Please don't kill me.

Well, I don't think it's me
you have to worry about.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.524

I didn't mean to hurt her.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.364

you son of a bitch.

34:03.120 --> 34:06.010
We are done. I never
want to see you again.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.409
If she ever does
see you again...

34:08.480 --> 34:11.370
No, no, I swear,
she'll never see me again.

34:15.960 --> 34:17.324

still eat like that.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.001
(ROARING)

39:35.400 --> 39:36.970
(DREAD SCREAMING)

39:42.240 --> 39:43.287
Stop!

39:44.960 --> 39:46.450
(SNARLING)

39:53.880 --> 39:54.927
You're a Grimm?

39:55.320 --> 39:56.321
It's okay, Zuri.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.561
You know?

39:58.720 --> 40:00.245
Yeah, he does.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.080
She didn't have a choice, Nick.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.204
Get her out of here.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.480
What are you gonna tell them?

40:16.000 --> 40:17.365
This is how we found them.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.530
What about Jared?

40:20.720 --> 40:22.210
Nick's got it.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.244
(JOY WHIMPERING)

40:31.160 --> 40:32.321
We need to talk.

40:48.560 --> 40:51.040
So you're okay with all this?

40:52.720 --> 40:54.563
I've learned to adapt.

40:55.360 --> 40:58.364
None of this changes
the way I feel about you.

40:59.160 --> 41:01.288
It wouldn't work, Hank.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.169
You don't know that.

41:05.120 --> 41:07.168
Why don't you give me a chance
to prove you wrong?

41:10.680 --> 41:13.286
We'll take it slow,
see what happens.

41:16.400 --> 41:18.846
You are such a special man.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.120
But I can't.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.400
Zuri, I don't have
a problem with it.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.806
But I do.

41:37.240 --> 41:38.241
(CHUCKLES)

41:45.840 --> 41:47.001
Take care of yourself.
