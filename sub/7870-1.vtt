WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.419
Good evening.

00:02.502 --> 00:05.005
Tonight, we reveal to you
the fate of Nedna.

00:05.088 --> 00:07.924
I have devoted my summer
to a more meaningful task:

00:08.008 --> 00:10.927
savaging
<i>Mr. Popper's Penguins</i> online.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.054
Anyway, the answer
to Ned and Edna

00:13.138 --> 00:15.473
is carefully hidden
in tonight's episode,

00:15.557 --> 00:18.351
like a bread crumb
lodged inside my stomach crease.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.644
Enjoy.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.522
("Walking on the Moon"
by The Police playing)

00:22.605 --> 00:24.315
Whoa!

00:27.944 --> 00:29.529

00:29.612 --> 00:30.530
(grumbles)

00:30.613 --> 00:32.198

00:33.616 --> 00:34.534
What the...?

00:35.452 --> 00:36.369
Aha!

(laughs)

01:25.919 --> 01:29.047
While I'm here,
I might as well pre-punch out.

01:31.174 --> 01:34.052
Hmm, we've had
a lot of bills lately.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.595
Better put in some overtime.

01:38.139 --> 01:39.933
(chuckles)

01:40.016 --> 01:41.184
(humming)

01:41.267 --> 01:43.728
Larry, my man!

01:43.812 --> 01:45.188
Hey, you're not Larry.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.439
How come you're
not Larry?

01:46.523 --> 01:48.566
I wouldn't know, sir.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.528
Uh, listen,
if you could indulge me,

01:51.611 --> 01:54.197
Larry and I fist-bump
every morning.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.991
Like that.
The warmth of human contact

01:57.075 --> 01:58.827
with a manly whiff of violence.

01:58.910 --> 01:59.994
Eh?

02:00.078 --> 02:01.913
Not interested.

02:01.996 --> 02:04.582
Wha...?!
Sheesh!

02:04.666 --> 02:06.334
Hey, what's with that
new security guard?

02:06.417 --> 02:07.836
He's acting all aloof.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.755
Uh, by the way, that's my
word of the day: "he's."

02:10.839 --> 02:12.674
Maybe I was
a little hard on him,

02:12.757 --> 02:14.968
expecting him to be Larry
right away.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.511
By the way, where is Larry?

02:16.594 --> 02:18.179
-Crazy house.
-Violent ward.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.014
Good ol' Larry.

02:20.098 --> 02:20.932
(humming)

02:21.015 --> 02:23.143
Say... Wayne,

02:23.226 --> 02:24.477
I couldn't help but notice

02:24.561 --> 02:26.354
that your breath doesn't
smell like alcohol.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.356
You want to go grab
a beer after work?

02:28.439 --> 02:30.859
I prefer not to have social
interaction with coworkers.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.570
It, um, hasn't worked out for me
in the past.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.823
Well, maybe he just
doesn't like fist-bumping.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.533
Hey, Wayne.

02:38.616 --> 02:43.705
As God as my witness,
this fist will be bumped!

02:43.788 --> 02:45.957
Put that fool thing down.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.126
<i>ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i>We now return to </i>Master Chef:

02:48.209 --> 02:50.003
Extreme Snack Edition.

02:51.880 --> 02:55.800
Marge, your ratio of peanut butter
to cracker was spot on.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.094
And I loved the addition
of the thin slice of apple.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.846
This was a great
plate of food.

02:59.929 --> 03:00.847
Thank you.

03:00.930 --> 03:03.725
This is my third favorite
reality cooking show.

03:03.808 --> 03:06.686
For your prize, you have won
a brand-new kitchen,

03:06.769 --> 03:07.979
which I will now become.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.898
(makes transforming noises)

03:09.981 --> 03:12.150
Ow! Ow! Ow!

03:12.233 --> 03:13.902
I miss my soul patch.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.820
(groans)
Oh.

03:17.530 --> 03:21.201
Kids, enjoy your
extreme snack.

03:22.493 --> 03:24.245
Wait, this tastes different.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.247
I put a slice of apple in it.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.332
Gross.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.083
You know
I hate surprises.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.084
You tricked us.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.962
I like routine.
I like routine.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.340
-(sighs)
-(sighs)

03:35.423 --> 03:36.966
Did you have
a hard day, too?

03:37.050 --> 03:40.011
Ah, a guy at work
seems not to like me.

03:40.094 --> 03:41.137
I guess it's not much

03:41.221 --> 03:43.181
when you look at real problems
in the world,

03:43.264 --> 03:46.100
like Major League umpires
not using instant replay.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.352
It's big to you.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.979
Would you like
a "get well" pork chop?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.147
I love you so much.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.441
Potatoes and gravy
on the side, please.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.860
(whistle blows)

03:57.320 --> 03:58.947
Charlie, want to grab a beer?

03:59.030 --> 04:02.533
No, I was tipsy last night
when a telephone survey called,

04:02.617 --> 04:04.410
so I told them
to call back tonight

04:04.494 --> 04:06.120
for more accurate answers.

04:06.204 --> 04:07.789
Oh. Okay.

04:07.872 --> 04:09.040
(thunder rumbling softly)

04:12.418 --> 04:13.962
(gasps)
Wayne!

04:15.463 --> 04:16.714
Want a ride?

04:16.798 --> 04:18.132
I can walk.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.302
(hail pattering)

04:22.845 --> 04:23.721
(groans)

04:23.805 --> 04:25.556
All right, Homer, you win.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.893
You know, I just got a little chill
when you said my name.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.061
(quietly)
Every town I go to,

04:30.144 --> 04:31.896
I run into some guy
just like this.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.691
Look, I'm not
weird or anything,

04:34.774 --> 04:37.360
I just like to feel like
I'm friends with everybody.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.821
(sighs)
Homer, you're a nice guy.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.197
I'll have one beer
with you.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.532
After that, we will have

04:42.615 --> 04:45.368
a courteous professional
relationship, and that's it.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.787
No Secret Santa,
we're not trading lunches...

04:47.870 --> 04:49.247
-Oh!
-and I don't want you

04:49.330 --> 04:51.291
calling me at home and saying
"Turn on channel six."

04:51.374 --> 04:52.375
But what if the weather girl...

04:52.458 --> 04:54.877
I don't care!

04:57.964 --> 05:00.383
Wow, I can't believe
Homer bagged the tiger.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.968
Excuse me, I need to use the...

05:02.051 --> 05:02.969
Men's room!

05:03.052 --> 05:04.095
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

05:04.178 --> 05:07.181
We're completing
each other's...

05:07.265 --> 05:09.767
Completing each other's...

05:09.851 --> 05:14.772
sen... ten... ces...

05:19.694 --> 05:21.696
Totally surprising entrance!

05:21.779 --> 05:22.739
(cocks gun)

05:22.822 --> 05:24.991
Hand over your
cash and jewelry.

05:25.074 --> 05:25.992
Pronto.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.702
(groans)

05:29.495 --> 05:31.748
Hmm. Hmm.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.833
Okay, now,
don't want no trouble.

05:33.916 --> 05:37.086
Let me just get my cash
out of my cash drawer here.

05:37.170 --> 05:41.049
Just, uh, lining up all
the presidents, nice and neat.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.842
Ain't trying to be no hero.

05:42.925 --> 05:43.801
(chuckles)

05:43.885 --> 05:45.762
Uh...
(chuckles)

05:45.845 --> 05:46.846
Uh, here you go.

05:46.929 --> 05:48.306
Thanks for the upgrade.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.349
Ha-ha!

05:53.061 --> 05:54.145
(grunts)

05:54.228 --> 05:56.481
-Wayne?
-Stand back, Homer!

05:56.564 --> 05:58.149
I know what I'm doing.

05:58.232 --> 05:59.734
Well, we all know
what we're doing.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.737
The question is, is it an appropriate
reaction to the situation?

06:02.820 --> 06:05.531
(sighs)
Drunks are so boring.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.325
-(gasps)
-(gunshot)

06:08.076 --> 06:10.745
(screams)
My fresco!

06:10.828 --> 06:13.247
That's coming out
of your stealings!

06:13.331 --> 06:14.749
(grunts)

06:14.832 --> 06:16.042
(yells)

06:16.125 --> 06:17.627
(grunts)

06:17.710 --> 06:21.339
Wayne, maybe it's the
me-being-still-alive talking,

06:21.422 --> 06:23.841
but I think you're awesome.

06:23.925 --> 06:27.470
I'm just a guy who saw what
needed to be done and did it.

06:27.553 --> 06:31.057
Oh, speaking of which,
let's get these eggs back in a jar.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.810
(humming)

06:36.354 --> 06:37.730
(cocks gun)

06:44.570 --> 06:46.989
Wow, that's the farthest
that one of my eggs

06:47.073 --> 06:49.117
ever made it down
someone's throat.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.872
It's great to have
a home-cooked meal.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.542
Well, if anyone
saves my Homie's life,

06:57.625 --> 06:58.918
they get a free meal.

06:59.001 --> 07:02.171
Which actually comes up
about once a week.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.215
So, Wayne,
how'd you learn

07:04.298 --> 07:05.925
all those cool
self-defense moves?

07:06.008 --> 07:08.052
I had training.
Special training.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.513
The kind they're not allowed
to give anymore.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.106
(grunts)

07:21.149 --> 07:22.233
(screams)

07:25.736 --> 07:26.737
(choking)

07:36.581 --> 07:39.083
(jabbering, grunts)

07:45.840 --> 07:48.009
(quacking laugh)

07:48.092 --> 07:49.594
(grunting)

07:49.677 --> 07:51.429
(yelling)

07:53.681 --> 07:54.765
(roaring)

07:54.849 --> 07:58.019
(straining)

08:00.021 --> 08:02.482
Sorry.
I have to go.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.150
Oh, come on,
stay for dessert!

08:04.233 --> 08:07.361
(straining)

08:07.445 --> 08:09.238
(sighs)

08:11.657 --> 08:14.535
Hey, Simpson, you want to hear
about the big change in my life?

08:14.619 --> 08:15.828
Sure, why not.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.247
I started drinking
orange juice with pulp.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.374
I asked the Reverend,
and he said it was okay.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.959
Then he hung
right up on me.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.504
That man is cranky
at 3:00 in the morning.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.801
And here he is,
this week's Noble Nobody.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.386
What the... (bleep)

08:32.470 --> 08:34.555
<i>A quiet, unassuming</i>
<i>security guard</i>

08:34.639 --> 08:36.641
<i>who foiled a robbery</i>
<i>at a local tavern,</i>

08:36.724 --> 08:39.727
<i>as seen in this Taiwanese</i>
<i>animated dramatization.</i>

speaking Taiwanese)

09:02.750 --> 09:03.709
(tires screeching)

09:03.793 --> 09:05.836
(video game sound effects)

09:08.089 --> 09:09.966
Please, sir,
just let me do my job.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.133
Pish tush.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.970
Wayne, as a reward for
your valiant fisticuffery,

09:14.053 --> 09:15.304
I hereby award you

09:15.388 --> 09:18.224
the Springfield Nuclear Plant
Silver Safety Hat.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.604
-(fanfare plays)
-(horses neigh)

09:23.688 --> 09:25.273
(chuckles maniacally)

09:27.608 --> 09:29.068
Thanks to you, Wayne,

09:29.151 --> 09:31.737
we did not lose the
visible half of the moon.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.072
Just doing my job, sir.

09:33.155 --> 09:34.115
All too well.

09:34.198 --> 09:35.575
I'm afraid that protocol demands

09:35.658 --> 09:37.577
that I totally
erase your memory.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.329
(grunting)

09:46.919 --> 09:47.878
(crackling)

09:47.962 --> 09:49.297
(grunting)

09:49.380 --> 09:52.049
Die, you fascist bastard!

09:52.133 --> 09:54.385
Mother, is that you?

09:54.468 --> 09:56.637
Wayne, stop!
That's Mr. Burns!

09:56.721 --> 09:59.307
(gasping)

09:59.390 --> 10:00.975
Ooh.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.644
I expect insolence,
but rank insolence?

10:03.728 --> 10:05.938
-Off with his job!
-(sighs)

10:06.022 --> 10:07.064
Damn it.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.483
Why don't you
come stay with us

10:09.567 --> 10:11.485
till you can get
back on your feet?

10:11.569 --> 10:13.321
Really? Are you sure?

10:13.404 --> 10:14.238
Of course.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.823
I mean, how long
could it be?

10:15.906 --> 10:16.949
I don't know.

10:17.033 --> 10:20.119
I've got no job, no references,
can't afford my apartment.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.913
It's best to concentrate
on what you do have.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.750
I have reoccurring flashbacks
to a nightmarish past.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.418
That's funny, because I have

10:27.501 --> 10:30.713
reoccurring flash-forwards
to a nightmarish future.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.342
(chanting)
Unfair! Unfair!

10:34.425 --> 10:36.594
That robot took our jobs!

10:37.928 --> 10:39.263
He said it.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.773
My nightmares are real.

Your voice is so gravelly,
just like Lauren Bacall's.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.786
If you don't listen to me,
Senator,

11:01.869 --> 11:04.163
there's not going to be
a Fourth of July!

11:04.246 --> 11:07.041
WAYNE: Don't you get it?
He used the governor's eyeball

11:07.124 --> 11:08.876
for the retinal scan!

11:08.959 --> 11:11.128
That's ten members
of the electoral college

11:11.212 --> 11:12.338

11:12.421 --> 11:14.256
If you don't give me
those launch codes,

11:14.340 --> 11:16.467
you'll never be able to make
the "okay" sign again.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.469
I know the map
is inside your eyelids,

11:18.552 --> 11:21.347

inside out if I have to!

11:21.430 --> 11:24.016
If you move that little top hat
to St. James Place,

11:24.100 --> 11:25.810

so many nightmares.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.069

unspeakable things,

11:35.152 --> 11:36.987
from Buenos Aires
to the Ukraine.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.572
Well, what brought you
to Springfield?

11:38.656 --> 11:41.492
Was it our Frito-Lay
distribution center?

11:41.575 --> 11:42.910
I needed somewhere to lie low.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.246
Your town appears
on no maps or charts.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.456
Yeah, they couldn't find
a Google map photo

11:47.540 --> 11:48.916
without me naked
or urinating.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.419
And when there was
a mapmaker's convention here,

11:51.502 --> 11:53.421
they all got
Lou Gehrig's disease.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.005
Not the one you're
thinking of--

11:55.089 --> 11:56.632
there's another one.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.968
So, Lisa, if you press
on Bart's elbow,

11:59.051 --> 11:59.969
-here,
-Ow!

12:00.052 --> 12:01.887
he'll tell you
anything you want to know.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.639
I admit it!
I let Milhouse

12:03.723 --> 12:04.765

12:04.849 --> 12:07.017

to Wayne alone a minute?

12:07.101 --> 12:08.686

12:08.769 --> 12:10.354

should teach our children

12:15.401 --> 12:17.695

techniques.

12:17.778 --> 12:18.779

12:18.863 --> 12:20.448
Sometimes I forget where I am.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.408
Apology accepted.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.786
Now, could you teach me
a couple little driving tricks?

12:34.545 --> 12:35.671

12:49.393 --> 12:51.562

I'd have to kill you.

12:51.645 --> 12:54.231
-Can I tell you?
-No! I won't listen!

12:54.315 --> 12:56.942

the same thing every day.
