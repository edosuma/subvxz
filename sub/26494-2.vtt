00:01.658 --> 00:05.061
I could have done this quick,
but I wanted to enjoy it.

00:08.843 --> 00:10.443
You hurt my friends.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.012
You hurt my family!

00:15.183 --> 00:17.683
You're not my father.
You're a monster.

00:17.685 --> 00:21.020
I don't need you.
I just need your power.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.559
Jack!

00:26.561 --> 00:27.860
Sammy!

00:27.862 --> 00:29.328
Jack!

00:29.330 --> 00:31.630
If we work together,
can we beat Lucifer?

00:31.632 --> 00:32.698
We have a chance.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.967
- We can't.
- Lucifer has Sam.

00:34.969 --> 00:37.837
He has Jack.
Cass, I don't have a choice!

00:46.814 --> 00:47.980
Bye, Dean.

00:47.982 --> 00:49.682
Dean!

01:02.263 --> 01:03.829
Dean?

01:03.831 --> 01:06.198
We had a deal!

01:10.038 --> 01:11.337
Michael?

01:11.339 --> 01:12.938
Thanks for the suit.

02:05.059 --> 02:06.892
Mm.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.661
A little of this...

02:11.265 --> 02:13.399
...a little of that.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.938
And...

02:25.913 --> 02:27.580
Yes.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.615
Good boy.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.933
Hmm.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.836
Too much "that."

02:50.838 --> 02:53.305
How disappointing.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.099
All right.

03:22.136 --> 03:24.627
Who's next?

03:24.628 --> 03:28.628

03:34.815 --> 03:37.516
Who goes to Duluth
in October?

03:37.518 --> 03:39.685
You sure Michael didn't
touch down in Orlando?

03:40.821 --> 03:42.555
Joe was
pretty specific --

03:42.557 --> 03:44.557
Duluth.

03:44.559 --> 03:47.993
Well, angels ain't known
for their veracity.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.098
No offense.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.235
None taken.
I tend to agree with you.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.406
Here you go.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.740
Thanks.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.509
Hey, what's that?

04:03.511 --> 04:06.278
So I've been searching through
police reports in Duluth.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.214
Cops just turned up
a pile of corpses

04:08.216 --> 04:10.182
that was dumped near
some train tracks

04:10.184 --> 04:11.717
just north of town,

04:11.719 --> 04:13.285
and their eyes
were burnt out.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.486
So Michael?

04:16.190 --> 04:18.423
We should go -- now.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.459
This isn't just Michael
we're talking about.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.294
It's Dean.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.462
Yeah.

04:24.899 --> 04:26.932
Cass, you know why you can't
come with us, right?

04:27.935 --> 04:30.736
My angelic presence
would be sensed by Michael,

04:30.738 --> 04:34.273
thereby nullifying your hopes
of a sneak attack.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.274
Yeah. Sorry.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.875
And...

04:36.877 --> 04:39.645
you need me to stay here
and babysit Nick and Jack.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.146
It's not babysitting,
Cass.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.615
Only in the sense
that they're not infants,

04:42.617 --> 04:44.416
but they both
have to be supervised.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.652
Jack is...
lost without his grace,

04:46.654 --> 04:48.554
and Nick is...

04:48.556 --> 04:49.989
I mean...

04:49.991 --> 04:51.423
he's just a mess.

04:51.425 --> 04:54.159
Well, i-it's not...
his fault.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.496
Cass, Nick was housing.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.498
You know, h-he deserves a shot
at rebuilding his life.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.166
And yet every time
I look at him, all I can see

05:01.168 --> 05:03.969
is the supreme agent
of evil.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.171
You talking
about my dad again?

05:08.609 --> 05:10.242
Look, I understand.

05:10.244 --> 05:13.846
Being around Nick --
it's hard for me, too.

05:13.848 --> 05:17.616
Uh, Jack, we're gonna need you
to sit this mission out.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.285
Not a permanent thing.

05:21.622 --> 05:24.623
I know the last time,
I sucked when it mattered,

05:24.625 --> 05:26.859
and I need to improve.

05:26.861 --> 05:29.128
So...

05:29.130 --> 05:30.696
that's what I'm gonna do.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.532
All right.

05:35.670 --> 05:37.803
Okay.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.505
Let's move.

06:03.698 --> 06:04.863
Hi.

06:04.865 --> 06:08.233
I brought you
some nourishment.

06:08.235 --> 06:10.469
Now that he's, uh...

06:10.471 --> 06:13.339
gone, y-you must
remember to eat.

06:14.775 --> 06:15.941
Right.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.012
Thanks.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.755
I'm not him, Castiel.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.226
I know.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.962
But you still
can't look at me.

06:40.201 --> 06:41.600
It's difficult.

06:43.104 --> 06:44.503
You don't remember
all the things

06:44.505 --> 06:47.339
that you did in his thrall,
but I do.

06:47.341 --> 06:49.441
I know.

06:50.845 --> 06:53.779
I just don't --
I don't...get it.

06:53.781 --> 06:56.715
I don't understand why I would
do something like that.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.283
I don't...

06:58.285 --> 07:03.088
I don't get how I would let
Lucifer possess me.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.731
You were in
a lot of pain.

07:14.235 --> 07:18.203
And Lucifer saw vulnerability,
and he...

07:18.205 --> 07:21.206
he exploited it.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.942
Is that what you tell yourself
so you can be near me?

07:26.147 --> 07:28.113
I guess so.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.318
I just don't know
what kind of pain would

07:33.320 --> 07:35.954
make me allow Lucifer
to possess me.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.861
It was your family.

07:44.999 --> 07:46.465
My family?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.438
Sarah and Teddy?

07:55.409 --> 07:56.408
No.

08:13.461 --> 08:15.160
<i>It's you, Nick.</i>

08:15.162 --> 08:16.428
<i>You're special.</i>

08:16.430 --> 08:18.263
You're chosen.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.766
<i>Nick, I need you</i>
<i>to say "yes."</i>

08:20.768 --> 08:23.368
Then yes.

08:23.370 --> 08:26.371
Oh, my God.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.173
Who could do that?

08:28.175 --> 08:29.775
Who could do that?

08:31.278 --> 08:34.613
A man...

08:34.615 --> 08:37.115
broke into your house...

08:37.116 --> 08:38.650
and you weren't there.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.118
That was no man.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.621
That's not a man.
That's a monster.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.456
That's a monster, and then --

08:44.458 --> 08:48.727
and then Lucifer found me
and made <i>me</i> a monster, too.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.896
Oh, my God!

08:50.898 --> 08:52.364
Ohh!

09:00.374 --> 09:02.074
These are just
some of the victims.

09:02.076 --> 09:05.511
More are in the hall,
a couple in a store room.

09:05.513 --> 09:08.847
We don't usually see
this kind of action in Duluth.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.549
The injuries
all pretty uniform?

09:10.551 --> 09:11.583
Yep.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.151
The boys upstairs think

09:13.153 --> 09:16.021
<i>maybe</i> we're looking
at a spree killer.

09:16.023 --> 09:21.126
If they were DOA,
you have an ETA on TOD?

09:22.997 --> 09:24.496
Any sample DFA?

09:24.498 --> 09:26.398
DNA?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.267
Uh, frankly,
we don't even know

09:28.269 --> 09:29.835
the precise cause
of death.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.770
I mean, there were
the neck wounds, of course,

09:31.772 --> 09:34.239
but there was also considerable
internal trauma, so --

09:36.677 --> 09:38.110
Excuse me.

09:38.112 --> 09:41.513
Yeah.
sure.

09:41.515 --> 09:43.215
"DFA"?

09:43.217 --> 09:46.251
I've been fighting a friggin'
apocalypse for 15 years.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.720
My FBI might be
a little rusty.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.589
All right.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.724
Let's give them a quick
once-over, see what they missed.

09:56.564 --> 09:58.964
Angel kills,
for sure.

09:58.966 --> 10:02.267
And not grunts.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.303
We're talking
five-star smitings.

10:04.305 --> 10:06.471
Knife slits
in the throat.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.206
And it doesn't appear
they bled out.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.309
He kept these people alive
for a while.

10:13.414 --> 10:16.048
Maybe these people
aren't...

10:16.050 --> 10:17.382
people.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.717
Looking at a vamp.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.918
Same here.

10:21.555 --> 10:22.921
Me too.

10:22.923 --> 10:25.057
Why milk 'em
if he's just gonna smite 'em?

10:25.059 --> 10:26.792
And why is an archangel
hunting vampires

10:26.794 --> 10:28.460
in the first place?

10:32.099 --> 10:33.632
Sorry. Excuse me.

10:33.634 --> 10:38.236
Um, did anyone come to claim
or identify these bodies?

10:38.238 --> 10:41.073
Oh, yeah --
a young lady.

10:41.075 --> 10:43.508
Said he heard about the killings
on the morning news,

10:43.510 --> 10:45.510
thought she might know
one of the victims.

10:45.512 --> 10:46.511
And...?

10:46.513 --> 10:47.779
She didn't.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.114
Then she disappeared.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.283
Never even gave us
her last name.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.687
Huh.

10:55.689 --> 10:58.724
Do you happen to have
surveillance cameras outside?

11:09.336 --> 11:14.706
Looks like about...
two centuries of biblical lore.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.608
Light reading.

11:16.610 --> 11:17.976
I'm researching
how long it takes

11:17.978 --> 11:20.679
archangel grace
to replenish.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.481
Well...

11:22.483 --> 11:24.616
archangels being
exceedingly rare,

11:24.618 --> 11:28.320
the data on that
is woefully scant.

11:28.322 --> 11:31.990
The books say it can take
from a month to...

11:31.992 --> 11:33.225
A century.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.294
Yeah.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.196
Complicating factor
being your...

11:38.198 --> 11:40.565
human component,
which slows the process.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.174
Jack, um...

11:49.176 --> 11:53.845
mourning
what you've lost...

11:53.847 --> 11:56.748
it's wasteful.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.051
Might be smarter to focus
on what you still have.

11:59.053 --> 12:01.086
You don't understand
what I'm going through.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.922
Yes, I do --
a little.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.858
At the time
of the Great Fall,

12:06.860 --> 12:08.760
when the angels were
banished from Heaven,

12:08.762 --> 12:11.029
I lost what I thought
was everything.

12:11.031 --> 12:14.232
I had no grace,
I had no...wings.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.736
I felt hopeless
and useless.

12:20.274 --> 12:22.507
What did you have left?

12:22.509 --> 12:24.042
Well, uh...

12:24.044 --> 12:27.379
Well, I had Sam and Dean.

12:27.381 --> 12:31.216
But I had something else
that was extremely helpful.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.486
I had myself.

12:36.356 --> 12:39.725
Just the basic me,
as, uh...

12:39.727 --> 12:42.394
as Dean would say, without
all the bells and whistles.

12:48.302 --> 12:51.403
You know...

12:51.405 --> 12:56.775
Sam and Dean, they weren't born
with their expertise.

12:56.777 --> 13:00.045
They've been at it
since they were children.

13:00.047 --> 13:05.484
Failing, winning,
developing over the years.

13:05.486 --> 13:08.153
Patience...
persistence --

13:08.155 --> 13:10.422
those are skills, too.

13:13.327 --> 13:15.994
The past,
where you came from,

13:15.996 --> 13:18.230
that's important,
but it is not as important

13:18.232 --> 13:22.300
as the future
and where you're going.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.793
Get...out!

13:47.795 --> 13:49.828
I don't think so.

13:49.830 --> 13:50.962
You can't!

13:50.964 --> 13:52.864
Oh, but I can.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.499
Because, see...

13:56.804 --> 13:58.637
I own you.

13:58.639 --> 14:01.973
So hang on...

14:01.975 --> 14:04.309
and enjoy the ride.

14:08.531 --> 14:10.866
That doesn't make
any sense, Sam.

14:10.868 --> 14:12.434
I've never heard
of an interaction

14:12.436 --> 14:14.636
between an archangel
and a vampire --

14:14.638 --> 14:17.473
certainly not
in <i>this</i> universe.

14:17.475 --> 14:21.977
And...why would Michael
be killing them?

14:21.979 --> 14:25.781
I mean, they're not
a threat to him.

14:25.783 --> 14:29.651
Yeah, okay. Well, just let me
know what you find out.

14:31.822 --> 14:34.456
Nick, are you, uh...

14:34.458 --> 14:36.058
Nothing.
Nothing.

14:36.060 --> 14:37.793
There's nothing.
There's no information.

14:37.795 --> 14:40.129
There's no mention
of my wife and son

14:40.131 --> 14:42.364
past the year
they were...

14:42.366 --> 14:44.199
when they died.

14:44.201 --> 14:47.136
There's -- There's nothing about
the case being solved. Nothing!

14:47.138 --> 14:48.971
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't know that.

14:48.973 --> 14:51.173
If I were around,
I would have been on those cops

14:51.175 --> 14:53.308
every single day,
Castiel.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.411
But I was out of my head
with grief.

14:55.413 --> 14:57.579
I said yes to Lucifer.

14:57.581 --> 14:59.248
I was a coward,
and now --

14:59.250 --> 15:01.150
Don't.

15:09.593 --> 15:11.026
Why did you do that?

15:14.365 --> 15:16.265
Do what?

15:16.267 --> 15:19.902
What went through your head
just now?

15:21.072 --> 15:22.771
Um, I don't know.
Nothing?

15:22.773 --> 15:24.840
What are you...
trying to get at?

15:24.842 --> 15:27.543
Even though he's departed,
there may be...

15:27.545 --> 15:29.545
some of his influence
still within you.

15:29.547 --> 15:31.013
Just...

15:48.766 --> 15:52.034
Lucifer may have inflicted
more damage on your psyche

15:52.036 --> 15:53.302
than we suspected.

15:53.304 --> 15:55.571
I don't have time
for this.

15:55.573 --> 15:57.372
I'm not letting this go,
Castiel.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.241
I'm gonna find out
who killed my family.

15:59.243 --> 16:01.110
Nick!

16:03.314 --> 16:05.214
And then what?

16:24.935 --> 16:26.401
Yeah?

16:26.403 --> 16:29.671
Lydia Crawford,
this is FBI. Open up.

16:32.676 --> 16:34.176
Open up!

16:38.516 --> 16:40.149
Hey! Stop!

16:40.151 --> 16:41.416
Get away from me!

16:41.418 --> 16:43.619
Don't move.
We know who you are.

16:43.621 --> 16:45.787
We know you went
to the morgue.

16:45.789 --> 16:47.823
We saw your license plate
on the security cams

16:47.825 --> 16:49.458
and pulled your address.

16:49.460 --> 16:52.427
You should've ditched the car
when you first got turned.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.530
Made this way too easy.

16:54.532 --> 16:56.532
You're not FBI.

16:56.534 --> 16:57.966
You're hunters.

16:57.968 --> 16:59.001
That's right.

17:03.641 --> 17:05.339
I haven't done
anything wrong.

17:05.342 --> 17:08.210
No,
vampires never do.

17:08.212 --> 17:10.712
My nest --
w-we fed on animal blood.

17:10.714 --> 17:14.449
We -- We lived quiet lives,
until...

17:14.451 --> 17:15.884
until <i>he</i> came.

17:15.886 --> 17:17.118
He?

17:17.121 --> 17:18.287
He who?

17:18.289 --> 17:20.821
I don't know his name,
but...

17:20.824 --> 17:22.057
he was strong.

17:24.127 --> 17:27.829
He tied all of us up
and...

17:27.830 --> 17:30.632
one by one, he'd take...

17:30.634 --> 17:33.468
blood from us.

17:33.470 --> 17:37.739
I couldn't see what he was
doing exactly, but...

17:37.741 --> 17:41.543
every time, there would be
this explosion,

17:41.545 --> 17:43.612
and my friends
would be dead.

17:45.015 --> 17:46.348
And when he was
coming for me,

17:46.350 --> 17:49.218
a couple of the others
tried to att--

17:49.220 --> 17:51.220
tried to attack him.

17:52.656 --> 17:55.924
I was able
to get away, but...

17:55.926 --> 17:57.826
they didn't make it.

17:57.828 --> 18:00.896
Why was he killing you?
Did he say?

18:00.898 --> 18:03.065
I don't think
he meant to.

18:03.067 --> 18:07.236
I-It's just that...
things seemed to go wrong.

18:09.273 --> 18:10.606
He wasn't killing.

18:10.608 --> 18:13.342
It was like...

18:13.344 --> 18:16.311
It was like
he was experimenting.

18:16.313 --> 18:18.247
Experimenting?
What for?

18:20.251 --> 18:22.451
That --
That's all I know.

18:22.453 --> 18:23.885
Okay.

18:23.887 --> 18:25.120
Nice chattin' with you.

18:25.122 --> 18:26.221
Wait, wait!

18:26.223 --> 18:27.789
I-I don't know
what he wanted.

18:27.791 --> 18:29.124
I-I don't know
who he was.

18:29.126 --> 18:30.926
But I-I do know
where he is.

18:30.928 --> 18:32.060
If...

18:32.062 --> 18:34.263
If you let me go.

18:43.107 --> 18:44.373
Thank you.

18:46.076 --> 18:47.542
Ooh!

18:49.113 --> 18:52.047
Very elegant.

18:52.049 --> 18:54.016
But, then...

18:54.018 --> 18:55.117
so are you.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.887
Thanks for
showing me around.

18:58.889 --> 19:02.924
I didn't realize there was
so much going on in...

19:02.926 --> 19:04.026
Where are we, again?

19:04.028 --> 19:05.294
Duluth.

19:05.296 --> 19:06.762
Of course.

19:08.399 --> 19:11.433
Nothing like
where I'm from.

19:11.435 --> 19:13.535
What's it like
in <i>your</i> hometown?

19:13.537 --> 19:15.103
Hmm.

19:15.105 --> 19:18.040
Empty, wind-swept,
dead bodies laying around.

19:20.044 --> 19:21.276
You're so funny.

19:22.880 --> 19:25.647
What a nice surprise,
meeting you.

19:25.649 --> 19:27.582
I bet you were wondering
what I was doing

19:27.584 --> 19:29.685
all by myself
in that bar tonight.

19:30.921 --> 19:33.121
I'm pretty sure I know
exactly what you were doing

19:33.123 --> 19:35.057
in that bar tonight.

19:35.059 --> 19:36.792
Oh, Michael.

19:37.995 --> 19:41.563
I am so not that girl.

19:41.565 --> 19:44.833
But you really are,
aren't you?

19:44.835 --> 19:47.469
You're terrible.

19:47.471 --> 19:49.438
You have no idea.

19:55.179 --> 19:58.447
Did you honestly think
I didn't know what you are?

20:01.318 --> 20:03.985
You think <i>you</i> picked <i>me?</i>

20:03.987 --> 20:05.520
<i>I</i> picked <i>you.</i>

20:13.697 --> 20:16.198
Now...

20:16.200 --> 20:17.866
summon your master.

20:24.191 --> 20:26.758
Detective,
my wife and son were murdered

20:26.760 --> 20:28.293
in Pike Creek, Delaware.

20:28.295 --> 20:31.262
You're a police lieutenant
in Pike Creek, Delaware.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.665
If you can't help me,
who can?

20:33.667 --> 20:35.467
Hello?

20:36.770 --> 20:38.036
You gotta be k--

20:43.543 --> 20:46.044
You know what a cold case is,
Castiel?

20:46.046 --> 20:47.612
Uh...

20:47.614 --> 20:51.116
It's a case too unimportant
for anybody to care about.

20:51.118 --> 20:54.719
My wife and son are dead --
gone forever.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.889
My life is gone with them,
and, uh...a-and nobody cares.

20:57.891 --> 20:59.591
These cops don't care.

20:59.593 --> 21:00.792
Well, I'm sorry.

21:00.794 --> 21:03.328
That sounds...
very difficult.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.362
Difficult?

21:05.866 --> 21:08.366
Yeah, you know what's difficult?
There's no evidence.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.402
There's no fingerprints.
There's no DNA.

21:10.404 --> 21:13.004
I mean, how does that
even happen?

21:13.006 --> 21:14.672
I mean, there was a witness
who came forward

21:14.674 --> 21:16.541
and said they saw someone
coming out of the house,

21:16.543 --> 21:18.676
and then they said
they didn't see anything at all,

21:18.678 --> 21:21.312
and the case died.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.181
Like everything else.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.354
Nick.

21:29.356 --> 21:32.357
You, on the other hand,
you've been given...

21:32.359 --> 21:34.159
a second chance.

21:34.161 --> 21:35.560
You're <i>not</i> dead.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.262
You don't understand.

21:37.264 --> 21:39.197
No, I do.

21:39.199 --> 21:42.100
Oh, because
your body was stolen?

21:42.102 --> 21:46.838
Because I am occupying
someone else's.

21:46.840 --> 21:50.375
All angels have to
in order to walk the earth.

21:50.377 --> 21:52.210
This...

21:54.881 --> 21:57.048
This was Jimmy Novak.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.584
"Occupy."

21:59.586 --> 22:02.620
Sounds like a cleaned-up way
of saying "steal."

22:03.723 --> 22:06.758
And, um, Jimmy --
Is that his name?

22:06.760 --> 22:08.359
He all right with that?

22:08.361 --> 22:09.961
Yes, he was.

22:09.963 --> 22:11.062
"Was"?

22:12.532 --> 22:14.332
Jimmy's dead.

22:19.406 --> 22:23.107
Castiel...

22:23.109 --> 22:26.945
you're just a stone-cold
body snatcher.

22:26.947 --> 22:28.980
You're no different
than Lucifer.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.716
I...

22:37.824 --> 22:39.924
I need to look in
on Jack.

22:43.597 --> 22:45.563
You know...

22:48.468 --> 22:51.636
...in all
my thousands of years...

22:56.243 --> 23:01.145
...what happened
to Jimmy Novak...

23:01.147 --> 23:03.248
and his family...

23:06.920 --> 23:09.120
...it's my greatest
regret.

23:41.388 --> 23:43.054
You first.

23:43.056 --> 23:46.024
100-year-old cognac.

23:46.026 --> 23:48.927
Strong notes of vanilla
and apricot.

23:51.298 --> 23:53.231
And zero undertones
of silver.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.468
I appreciate you
accepting my invitation.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.637
Yes, well,
the ever-tactful Melanie

23:59.639 --> 24:01.506
thought a refusal unwise.

24:01.508 --> 24:02.974
She thinks you're a god.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.578
An archangel.

24:07.881 --> 24:09.914
But close.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.917
And I'm the leader
of a werewolf pack.

24:12.919 --> 24:16.321
Why on Earth would an archangel
care about us?

24:16.323 --> 24:17.555
About me?

24:17.557 --> 24:18.723
I admire you.

24:20.327 --> 24:22.427
Eating on the run,
surviving,

24:22.429 --> 24:25.163
despite being stalked
by those venal humans, who...

24:25.165 --> 24:27.198
think of you
as nothing but vermin.

24:27.200 --> 24:30.368
My pack has survived
and prospered for centuries,

24:30.370 --> 24:32.036
despite the humans.

24:32.038 --> 24:34.872
Yes.
Well, I'm new to town.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.240
And from my perspective,

24:36.242 --> 24:38.076
the real monsters
of this world --

24:38.078 --> 24:41.779
the ones that cheat, covet,
lay waste to this planet --

24:41.781 --> 24:43.114
are the humans.

24:43.116 --> 24:45.283
Who made them top dog?

24:45.285 --> 24:46.551
Pardon the pun.

24:48.088 --> 24:50.421
God, I suppose.

24:52.192 --> 24:53.958
God who?

24:56.229 --> 24:58.229
Between us, Philippe,

24:58.231 --> 25:00.298
God's on
permanent vacation.

25:00.300 --> 25:02.834
Gone fishin'.

25:02.836 --> 25:05.603
Demons and angels don't seem
to be much of a factor here,

25:05.605 --> 25:07.105
so...

25:07.107 --> 25:08.773
I'm in charge.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.975
And what do you
want from me?

25:10.977 --> 25:13.911
You and your kind,
you...

25:13.913 --> 25:16.047
are who you are.

25:16.049 --> 25:17.949
You kill,

25:17.951 --> 25:21.653
but not for sport
or trophies --

25:21.655 --> 25:22.754
to live.

25:22.756 --> 25:25.657
There's a purity in that.

25:25.659 --> 25:27.959
Isn't it time
you had your due?

25:27.961 --> 25:29.327
Our due?

25:29.329 --> 25:32.430
There are ways
to enhance your...

25:32.432 --> 25:33.965
let's call them
talents.

25:33.967 --> 25:36.167
And these ways are...

25:36.169 --> 25:38.002
Fully tested.

25:38.004 --> 25:41.305
There were some misfires early.
I will admit to that.

25:41.307 --> 25:44.008
But I have
cracked the code.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.410
And now what?

25:45.412 --> 25:47.745
Do you propose we wage a war
on the humans,

25:47.747 --> 25:49.681
keeping only
as many of them alive

25:49.683 --> 25:53.718
as we need for slave labor
and a steady food supply?

25:55.255 --> 25:57.455
Because I love
that world.

25:57.457 --> 26:01.325
But, believe me,
it's an absurd dream.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.460
Is it?

26:06.332 --> 26:08.633
Why be the hunted...

26:08.635 --> 26:11.302
when you can be
the hunter?

26:11.304 --> 26:12.303
Hmm?

26:15.875 --> 26:17.608
Can I help you?

26:17.610 --> 26:19.610
Mrs. Kline?

26:19.612 --> 26:21.112
Yes.

26:21.114 --> 26:22.980
I'm...

26:22.982 --> 26:26.217
a...friend of
your daughter, Kelly.

26:26.219 --> 26:27.385
Oh.

26:27.387 --> 26:28.786
My name is Jack.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.221
So is mine.

26:32.058 --> 26:33.491
I know.

26:34.894 --> 26:37.161
W-Well, please, come in.

26:39.899 --> 26:41.966
I was in the area
and wanted to say hello.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.002
Thank you.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.405
Kelly always had such nice
things to say about her family.

26:49.209 --> 26:51.042
So, how did you know
our Kelly?

26:51.044 --> 26:52.510
Through work?

26:52.512 --> 26:53.678
She...

26:53.680 --> 26:55.646
basically gave me
my start.

26:55.648 --> 26:57.682
So you were like her intern.

26:57.684 --> 27:00.418
Took you under her wing.
That's just like her.

27:02.055 --> 27:05.323
We haven't heard from her
in a long time.

27:05.325 --> 27:08.493
Well, she went traveling,
but she couldn't tell us where.

27:08.495 --> 27:10.928
She really couldn't.

27:10.930 --> 27:14.499
So it was part of her...
government work --

27:14.501 --> 27:15.700
classified and all that?

27:18.705 --> 27:20.371
Oh, please.

27:23.376 --> 27:25.209
Is that her?

27:25.211 --> 27:26.677
Sixth grade.

27:26.679 --> 27:28.412
She won the spelling bee.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.848
"Chrysanthemum" was
the winning word.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.084
Lucky. We grew them
in the yard.

27:37.090 --> 27:38.456
Forgive me.

27:38.458 --> 27:41.259
But, um, Kelly told us
she was pregnant.

27:41.261 --> 27:43.027
We didn't push
for details.

27:43.029 --> 27:45.429
We felt she'd tell us more
when she was ready.

27:48.802 --> 27:52.537
Uh, she...

27:52.539 --> 27:54.639
she had the baby.

27:56.376 --> 27:57.375
A boy.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.358
We have a grandson.

28:02.949 --> 28:04.515
You do.

28:04.517 --> 28:07.118
And in the time
I spent with her,

28:07.120 --> 28:08.786
she was
an amazing mother.

28:11.925 --> 28:13.958
Her son loves her
very much.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.127
Oh, I can just imagine.

28:16.129 --> 28:21.833
She would sing and talk to him
even before he was born.

28:21.835 --> 28:24.101
She made him feel...

28:24.103 --> 28:27.605
safe and...

28:27.607 --> 28:28.840
wanted.

28:30.743 --> 28:33.744
I heard her tell him
that it isn't fate

28:33.746 --> 28:37.148
or her or his dad
who sets his path.

28:37.150 --> 28:38.683
It's himself.

28:40.353 --> 28:42.286
Who he chooses to be.

28:43.523 --> 28:46.324
I know it's nutty,
but...

28:46.326 --> 28:50.528
Jack here --
he kind of looks like her.

28:52.599 --> 28:54.165
See?

28:59.505 --> 29:00.872
I don't know.

29:02.642 --> 29:04.342
But...

29:04.344 --> 29:09.347
I hope some day to have
a little of her courage and...

29:09.349 --> 29:10.815
purpose.

29:14.354 --> 29:15.686
I didn't mean
to intrude.

29:15.688 --> 29:17.054
Oh, no, not at all.
Hey, no.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.222
I had to meet you.

29:19.859 --> 29:23.060
If you see Kelly...

29:23.062 --> 29:24.595
tell her we miss her.

29:25.565 --> 29:27.198
I will.

29:29.035 --> 29:30.835
I miss her, too.

29:58.731 --> 30:00.398
Lydia.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.667
I...

30:02.669 --> 30:03.668
I didn't...

30:03.670 --> 30:05.569
Of course you did.

30:07.273 --> 30:08.873
The hunters.

30:10.543 --> 30:13.411
Why do you think I dumped
your brothers and sisters

30:13.413 --> 30:15.446
in plain sight?

30:18.117 --> 30:21.085
Why do you think
I let you escape?

30:21.087 --> 30:23.955
You let me escape?

30:23.957 --> 30:26.123
Rule number 1 --

30:26.125 --> 30:28.159
you can't have a trap
without bait.

30:30.063 --> 30:32.229
That brings us
to rule number 2,

30:32.231 --> 30:34.098
which says...

30:34.100 --> 30:36.267
once the trap
has been sprung,

30:36.269 --> 30:38.836
you don't need the bait
anymore.

30:54.033 --> 30:56.034
Jack, what were you thinking,
taking that kind of a risk?

30:56.036 --> 30:57.703
No, it wasn't a risk.

30:57.705 --> 31:00.872
But t-to go out there
alone?

31:00.874 --> 31:02.374
Jack, you have
been on the radar

31:02.376 --> 31:04.676
of every angel and demon
and power broker in creation

31:04.678 --> 31:06.144
since the day you were born,
and I'm sorry,

31:06.146 --> 31:08.347
but you're not exactly
yourself.

31:08.349 --> 31:10.549
Weak and defenseless,
you mean.

31:10.551 --> 31:12.117
I mean that

31:12.119 --> 31:15.621
the possibility of capture
is real, yes.

31:15.623 --> 31:16.955
I heard what you were
saying, Cass,

31:16.957 --> 31:18.790
about me finding out
where I came from.

31:18.792 --> 31:20.892
Well, I never knew
my mother.

31:22.363 --> 31:24.896
I thought the next best thing
might be for me

31:24.898 --> 31:26.898
to meet the only real family
that I have left.

31:26.900 --> 31:29.034
That is not --

31:32.506 --> 31:33.939
Well, did it help?

31:36.477 --> 31:38.477
And you didn't tell them
who you were, did you?

31:38.479 --> 31:40.779
Of course not.

31:45.886 --> 31:48.520
I wanted to.

31:48.522 --> 31:51.823
I wanted to tell them
I was their grandson.

31:51.825 --> 31:55.961
They thought I actually
kind of looked like her.

31:59.333 --> 32:01.033
I...

32:03.671 --> 32:07.406
I couldn't tell them
that she died.

32:07.408 --> 32:10.942
They just...
love her so much.

32:14.081 --> 32:16.848
I know I should have.

32:16.850 --> 32:18.950
What you did,
you did...

32:18.952 --> 32:20.952
from a place
of kindness.

32:23.257 --> 32:27.092
I suppose there are
worse ways to be human

32:27.094 --> 32:29.261
than to be kind.

32:33.567 --> 32:35.267
Have you heard
from Sam?

32:35.269 --> 32:36.601
Did they find Michael?

32:36.603 --> 32:38.203
Yeah, they think so.

32:38.205 --> 32:40.472
So they're gonna try
and kill him?

32:40.474 --> 32:42.574
Uh...no.

32:42.576 --> 32:44.643
No, the -- the plan
is to subdue him

32:44.645 --> 32:46.311
using angel cuffs
and spell work.

32:46.313 --> 32:48.814
They have to get Michael
out of Dean.

32:48.816 --> 32:50.449
And if he doesn't leave?

32:51.618 --> 32:53.385
Then they'll try
to drive him out.

32:53.387 --> 32:55.053
- And if that doesn't work?
- Jack --

32:55.055 --> 32:57.789
Cass, Michael
has to be stopped.

32:57.791 --> 33:00.826
I know, and he will be,
after Dean is --

33:00.828 --> 33:03.395
No, Dean doesn't matter.

33:03.397 --> 33:05.664
You're all so focused
on trying to save Dean.

33:05.666 --> 33:09.735
And I get it, I understand,
but if he can't be saved,

33:09.737 --> 33:14.639
if it comes down
to him or Michael...

33:14.641 --> 33:17.175
Michael
has to be stopped.

33:17.177 --> 33:18.577
Caged or killed --

33:18.579 --> 33:20.278
And if that means
that Dean dies, too?

33:20.280 --> 33:22.447
Then Dean dies.
I know this Michael.

33:22.449 --> 33:24.015
I've seen what he's done
to an entire world,

33:24.017 --> 33:25.350
and so have you.

33:25.352 --> 33:26.752
If stopping that
from happening here

33:26.754 --> 33:29.254
means that Dean
has to die, then...

33:32.159 --> 33:35.026
Do you think he'd want it
any other way?

33:53.180 --> 33:57.315
Well, it is so good to see you
after all these years.

33:58.084 --> 34:00.055
I mean...

34:00.056 --> 34:01.889
after that night,
you just disappeared,

34:01.891 --> 34:04.125
and I never knew
what happened.

34:04.127 --> 34:06.594
Yeah, after I lost my family,
I couldn't stand

34:06.596 --> 34:09.297
being in that house
one more minute.

34:09.299 --> 34:12.199
Nick,
I completely understand.

34:12.202 --> 34:13.301
Do you?

34:15.103 --> 34:17.471
I just hope these years
have been healing

34:17.473 --> 34:19.706
and restful for you.

34:19.708 --> 34:22.944
My whole family
was slaughtered, Arty.

34:22.946 --> 34:27.148
There's no...restful
for me anymore.

34:27.150 --> 34:29.449
The best thing
I could hope for

34:29.452 --> 34:31.819
is that I catch the monster
who did it.

34:33.255 --> 34:36.324
Well, sure, Nick.
We all -- We all want that.

34:38.261 --> 34:39.760
Do you, though, Arty?

34:40.763 --> 34:42.295
'Cause you said
you got a good look

34:42.297 --> 34:44.264
at the man
who left my house,

34:44.266 --> 34:46.634
and then
you changed your story.

34:48.705 --> 34:52.706
Well, I had to, Nick,
because there <i>was</i> no man.

34:54.409 --> 34:55.810
I mean, I...

34:55.812 --> 34:57.110
In the heat
of the moment,

34:57.112 --> 34:59.146
I guess I thought
I saw something.

34:59.148 --> 35:01.148
I wanted so much
to help.

35:01.150 --> 35:02.850
But I was wrong.

35:04.454 --> 35:05.987
Hmm.

35:08.791 --> 35:10.791
Is that the window
you were looking out of?

35:10.793 --> 35:13.261
Uh...

35:15.265 --> 35:17.932
What made you
look out, Arty?

35:17.934 --> 35:20.534
You hear
someone scream?

35:20.536 --> 35:24.205
Uh, I-I don't really remember.

35:29.279 --> 35:30.645
The man you saw,
was he --

35:30.647 --> 35:31.979
was he rushing out,
or was he casual?

35:31.981 --> 35:33.347
Nick,
I told you that --

35:33.349 --> 35:34.849
What, did he have
a hammer?

35:37.053 --> 35:39.387
'Cause that's how the cops said
he murdered my family.

35:39.389 --> 35:42.490
He smashed their skulls...

35:42.492 --> 35:44.392
over and over
with a hammer.

35:46.162 --> 35:49.297
Nick, there --
there was no man.

35:49.299 --> 35:51.499
Oh, Arty.

35:53.403 --> 35:55.569
Who got to you?

35:55.571 --> 35:56.804
W-W-What?

35:56.806 --> 35:58.172
Somebody get to you?

35:58.174 --> 35:59.240
No.

35:59.242 --> 36:00.574
They pay you off?

36:00.576 --> 36:02.310
I mean -- N-No.

36:02.312 --> 36:03.411
Or were you just scared?

36:03.413 --> 36:05.313
Huh? Huh?

36:05.315 --> 36:07.548
I just remembered wrong.
That's all there is to it.

36:07.550 --> 36:10.584
My family deserves justice.
Do you understand me?

36:10.586 --> 36:12.987
<i>I</i> deserve justice!
I'm gonna get justice!

36:12.989 --> 36:14.588
Do you understand me,
Arty?!

36:14.590 --> 36:16.424
I don't know anything!

36:16.426 --> 36:18.893
Oh, I think you do,
Arty.

36:18.895 --> 36:20.895
I think you do.

36:34.844 --> 36:36.444
You think
vamp girl was lying

36:36.446 --> 36:39.246
about Michael
hiding out here?

36:39.248 --> 36:41.415
Not sure
why she would.

36:41.417 --> 36:43.718
I mean, she has every reason
to want him dead.

36:46.522 --> 36:48.622
She wasn't lying about
the slaughter happening here.

36:48.624 --> 36:51.025
Whole lot of dried blood
on the floor.

36:51.027 --> 36:53.194
Why was he
killing them?

36:53.196 --> 36:56.430
And what did she mean
by "experimenting"?

36:57.900 --> 36:59.900
Don't look like
he's here.

37:02.905 --> 37:04.772
Werewolves!

37:11.447 --> 37:14.081
Silver bullets
aren't working!

37:15.718 --> 37:16.751
Nothing's working!

37:26.662 --> 37:28.329
Well, <i>that</i> works.

38:15.178 --> 38:17.878
Is everybody okay?
Anyone get bit?

38:17.880 --> 38:19.613
No.

38:19.615 --> 38:21.782
I'm okay.

38:24.620 --> 38:27.721
What the hell kinda werewolves
were those?

38:27.723 --> 38:30.224
Silver didn't touch 'em.

38:58.421 --> 38:59.520
Sammy.

39:00.857 --> 39:02.456
It's me.

39:17.036 --> 39:18.636
Dean.

39:19.706 --> 39:21.839
Is it really you?

39:21.841 --> 39:23.708
Yeah, it's really me.

39:25.278 --> 39:26.277
A-Are you okay?

39:26.279 --> 39:28.713
No, I'm not okay!

39:28.715 --> 39:30.815
But you got Michael
to leave.

39:30.817 --> 39:33.184
No, I -- I don't...

39:33.186 --> 39:34.552
I didn't.

39:34.554 --> 39:35.787
What?

39:35.789 --> 39:38.856
He just --
He just left.

39:38.858 --> 39:40.158
Why?

39:40.160 --> 39:42.026
I don't know.

39:44.330 --> 39:46.697
I don't know.
