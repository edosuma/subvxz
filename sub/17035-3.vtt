WEBVTT

00:06.913 --> 00:08.112
It's just so strange.

00:08.114 --> 00:09.781
I've never seen anything like it.

00:09.783 --> 00:11.549
Hey, guys. What are you looking at?

00:11.551 --> 00:12.448
Whoa.

00:15.353 --> 00:17.087
What is Axl doing?

00:17.089 --> 00:19.923
I think he's frolicking.

00:19.925 --> 00:21.124
Oh, my God!

00:21.126 --> 00:23.193
Is that what love looks like?

00:23.195 --> 00:24.705
Why you asking us?

00:25.764 --> 00:27.497
Hey, Brick, got a haircut.

00:27.499 --> 00:29.832
Ah, it's not my choice.
I did it for Cindy.

00:29.834 --> 00:31.200
The heart wants what it wants,

00:31.202 --> 00:32.735
and apparently it wants vintage Brick.

00:33.357 --> 00:35.971
So, what's up, honey?

00:35.973 --> 00:39.341
You escaping your gross dorm
room for the comforts of home?

00:39.343 --> 00:40.810
That's a sad state of affairs.

00:40.812 --> 00:43.879
Yeah. We have a bit of a mold issue.

00:43.881 --> 00:46.280
Lexie's dad flew her
to Barbados for the weekend.

00:46.282 --> 00:48.149
Plus I'm still 20% scared of ghosts.

00:49.485 --> 00:52.020
I'll be right back, babe!
I ache when I'm not with you.

00:53.456 --> 00:55.023
Knit hats, let's go.

00:55.025 --> 00:56.858
April thinks it'd be cute
if we're both wearing them.

00:56.860 --> 00:59.460
Um, I'll have to check if I have any.

00:59.462 --> 01:01.395
How do you not know
if you have knit hats?

01:01.397 --> 01:03.030
Oh, God, you are so unorganized!

01:03.032 --> 01:05.232
Dad, you got to stop
being so scared of Mom

01:05.233 --> 01:06.874
and tell her to get
a basket of knit hats.

01:07.446 --> 01:09.002
What are you looking at, Frodo?

01:11.874 --> 01:13.806
That seemed harsher than normal.

01:14.509 --> 01:17.044
Now, look, Brick, Halloween
is right around the corner.

01:17.046 --> 01:19.713
So if there's anything you need
fashioned out of feathers,

01:19.715 --> 01:22.681
tell me now so I can give
Nancy Donahue some lead time.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.516
Actually, now that I'm in high school,

01:24.518 --> 01:26.452
it's more about parties
than trick-or-treating.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.755
Oh, you're going to a party, huh?

01:28.757 --> 01:30.356
Negative, but Troy, Cindy, and I

01:30.358 --> 01:32.725
are planning on standing
on the periphery of one

01:32.727 --> 01:34.393
and hoping to be invited in by a parent.

01:36.064 --> 01:38.230
Hi, I'm April.

01:38.232 --> 01:40.632
Yeah, we know.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.600
Looks like you guys
were having fun out there.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.336
This is my favorite time of year.

01:45.338 --> 01:48.073
The end of fall,
right before autumn begins.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.340
Mm.

01:49.342 --> 01:51.542
Oh, babe, the little girls' room
is right down the hall.

01:51.544 --> 01:52.510
Okay.

01:52.512 --> 01:53.844
First door on the left.

01:53.846 --> 01:55.412
Don't be gone too long now.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.615
Do we not have any cocoa? God.

01:58.617 --> 02:00.284
Ooh, I would love a cup of cocoa.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.752
Dogs can't eat chocolate!

02:01.754 --> 02:03.487
Oh, my God.

02:03.489 --> 02:05.756
Is this you when you were little?

02:05.758 --> 02:06.791
Way to go, Mom.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.491
Thanks for leaving photos on the wall!

02:08.494 --> 02:09.494
Who does that?!

02:11.062 --> 02:13.296
Okay, it's not fair
that he's so nice to her

02:13.298 --> 02:14.931
and so mean to us.

02:14.933 --> 02:16.632
Yeah, what is going on?

02:16.634 --> 02:18.001
He was getting nicer.

02:18.003 --> 02:19.235
He let me stay in his room.

02:19.237 --> 02:21.104
He was inviting me to parties.

02:21.106 --> 02:23.773
And now he's all,
"Dogs can't have chocolate!"

02:23.775 --> 02:26.676
And yesterday he called me a horse,

02:26.678 --> 02:29.783
which isn't the worst thing,
except he also did this.

02:32.082 --> 02:33.628
I know what's going on.

02:34.084 --> 02:36.685
The kid's got a certain amount
of snark that's got to come out,

02:36.687 --> 02:40.055
and since he's with April 24/7,
it's got nowhere to go.

02:40.057 --> 02:41.589
It's... It's like a plugged-up hose.

02:41.591 --> 02:43.158
The water's gonna come out somewhere.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.426
So what, we're just supposed
to sit back and get bullied?

02:45.428 --> 02:46.861
Well, that's what I usually do,

02:46.863 --> 02:48.930
but I thought you guys
would have other options.

02:48.932 --> 02:51.098
The guy's in love.
Let's give it a couple weeks.

02:51.100 --> 02:53.835
If he starts saying
that I'm scared of Mom again,

02:53.837 --> 02:55.303
I'll put the hammer down.

02:59.042 --> 03:00.208
Hey, Brick.

03:00.210 --> 03:01.975
Just kind of looking
for a quiet place to study.

03:02.777 --> 03:03.844
Hmm.

03:03.846 --> 03:06.412
You know, it's funny.

03:06.414 --> 03:08.681
I gave you my room for the summer.

03:08.683 --> 03:10.583
Poof! Summer's gone.

03:10.585 --> 03:11.885
Where does the time go?

03:11.887 --> 03:14.120
Well, it's always summer somewhere.

03:14.122 --> 03:16.957
I guess, but summer in Orson...
definitely over.

03:16.959 --> 03:18.191
Is it, though?

03:18.193 --> 03:19.658
'Cause we're kind of having
an Indian summer.

03:19.660 --> 03:22.261
According to Axl's girlfriend,
it's fall and almost autumn.

03:22.263 --> 03:23.562
But you're only here for the weekend.

03:23.564 --> 03:25.630
True, but I'll be needing
my room at Thanksgiving,

03:25.632 --> 03:27.132
and that is right around the corner.

03:27.134 --> 03:29.801
Not "right around" the corner,
and Thanksgiving

03:29.803 --> 03:32.071
is really more about
being together with family.

03:32.073 --> 03:34.473
It's also about me spending time
in my room.

03:34.475 --> 03:36.374
Plus, turkey has a lot of tryptophan,

03:36.376 --> 03:37.675
so that's gonna make me tired

03:37.677 --> 03:39.277
and I'm gonna want to sleep in my bed,

03:39.279 --> 03:41.746
which is in my room.

03:41.748 --> 03:44.082
Have they really proven
the tryptophan thing?

03:44.084 --> 03:45.716
Yeah, Brick. It's pretty proven.

03:45.718 --> 03:50.388
Well, we can go back and forth
on this all day.

03:50.390 --> 03:51.756
It's my room, Brick.

03:51.758 --> 03:54.157
You've made some very excellent points.

03:54.159 --> 03:55.658
It's a lot to chew on.

04:03.702 --> 04:04.768
What are you doing?

04:04.770 --> 04:07.304
Axl. Axl! A...

04:09.000 --> 04:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:17.115 --> 04:18.915
Oh! Babe!

04:20.618 --> 04:22.184
Got that for you.

04:22.186 --> 04:24.253
Oh, you guys gonna carve pumpkins?

04:24.255 --> 04:26.522
How'd you connect those dots?

04:26.524 --> 04:27.889
It's just that you never really seemed

04:27.891 --> 04:29.524
interested in doing that before.

04:29.526 --> 04:31.692
When have you ever asked me
to carve pumpkins?

04:31.694 --> 04:32.928
Hmm, let me think.

04:32.930 --> 04:34.729
Uh, every Halloween since you were 5,

04:34.731 --> 04:35.997
and a couple of Christmases

04:35.999 --> 04:37.933
when we still had pumpkins lying around.

04:37.935 --> 04:39.700
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Are those my magazines?

04:39.702 --> 04:40.802
Oh, no, no, no!

04:40.804 --> 04:43.138
Don't wreck anything
with a royal on the cover.

04:43.140 --> 04:44.871
Those are collector's items.

04:44.873 --> 04:46.240
Oh, and look.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.842
It's the special
Shakeups and Breakups issue.

04:48.844 --> 04:51.412
I never got to read this 'cause
it was right when Brick was born

04:51.414 --> 04:52.947
and he was colicky.

04:52.949 --> 04:55.615
I believe that was the
Ferguson baby who was colicky.

04:55.617 --> 04:57.952
Brad Pitt was married
to Jennifer Aniston?

04:57.954 --> 05:00.020
Oh, yes, they were Hollywood's
golden couple,

05:00.022 --> 05:01.120
and they just couldn't make it work.

05:01.122 --> 05:02.355
Oh.

05:02.357 --> 05:04.623
Yeah, says here he wanted kids
and she didn't.

05:04.625 --> 05:06.826
Yep. Probably a good thing
they didn't have kids.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.995
How would they decide
which parent to go with?

05:08.997 --> 05:10.296
You got to go with Pitt.

05:10.298 --> 05:12.165
I mean, he was Thor.

05:12.167 --> 05:13.833
Mm, that was Chris Hemsworth.

05:13.835 --> 05:15.335
He's dreamy.

05:15.337 --> 05:17.603
What if Mom and Dad got a divorce?

05:17.605 --> 05:18.736
Who would we go with?

05:18.738 --> 05:19.804
- Dad.
- Dad.

05:19.806 --> 05:21.106
Dad.

05:22.176 --> 05:24.542
Okay, it's not so much
that you all said Dad.

05:24.544 --> 05:26.778
It's the swiftness
with which you said it.

05:26.780 --> 05:28.146
Why don't you just take a minute

05:28.148 --> 05:30.815
and think about it before you answer?

05:32.119 --> 05:33.085
- Dad.
- Dad.

05:33.087 --> 05:34.087
Dad.

05:34.721 --> 05:35.619
Okay, then.

05:35.621 --> 05:36.687
It's nothing personal.

05:36.689 --> 05:39.156
I just think Dad would need me more.

05:39.158 --> 05:41.592
I don't think he could survive
without a woman in his life.

05:41.594 --> 05:43.961
Actually, now that I think about
it, I wouldn't go with Dad.

05:43.963 --> 05:45.262
Thank you, Brick.

05:45.264 --> 05:48.032
I'd go with Axl and April.
She smells really nice.

05:48.034 --> 05:50.809
I just finished a Life Saver.

05:52.404 --> 05:54.604
Well, listen, it's okay. I get it.

05:54.606 --> 05:57.673
Nobody wants to live
with the big mean mom monster.

05:57.675 --> 06:00.210
'Cause we're always like,
"Brush your teeth!

06:00.212 --> 06:02.945
Do your homework! Flush!"

06:02.947 --> 06:04.114
Yeah.

06:04.116 --> 06:05.815
I guess that's just the way
it's always been.

06:05.817 --> 06:08.485
Moms always get the raw end
of the deal, right, April?

06:08.487 --> 06:10.552
I'd definitely go with my mom.

06:10.554 --> 06:11.620
We're best friends.

06:11.622 --> 06:12.754
Aww.

06:14.225 --> 06:16.758
Well, this is a fun conversation.

06:16.760 --> 06:18.593
No, that's what I love about my family.

06:18.595 --> 06:21.530
We can just be who we are
and razz each other.

06:21.532 --> 06:23.298
We're a family of razzers.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.901
It's funny, 'cause we'd never
get divorced anyway.

06:25.903 --> 06:27.868
I mean, neither of us
would have an affair.

06:27.870 --> 06:29.637
We're too tired. Am I right?

06:31.574 --> 06:34.208
No, seriously, I'm fine.

06:34.210 --> 06:35.643
It's not like we're asking
you guys to say

06:35.645 --> 06:37.245
which one of us you love more.

06:37.247 --> 06:38.679
You don't have to answer that!

06:45.998 --> 06:49.025
No, no, no. I miss you more.

06:49.466 --> 06:52.733
Well, I was dreaming about you
and I woke up missing you.

06:52.735 --> 06:54.435
Ugh. Oh.

06:54.437 --> 06:56.604
Babe, I got to go.
My service animal's awake.

07:01.343 --> 07:02.476
Aah!

07:02.699 --> 07:05.466
Okay, you know what? No!

07:05.468 --> 07:08.102
I do not care if you are
a plugged-up hose.

07:08.104 --> 07:11.171
You cannot treat me this way,
and neither can Brick!

07:14.444 --> 07:17.243
I want my room back!

07:20.449 --> 07:21.448
May I help you?

07:21.450 --> 07:23.249
W-What is this?

07:23.251 --> 07:24.651
I've added some new security measures.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.620
Santiago and I didn't feel safe.

07:26.622 --> 07:28.522
Tina. I don't know who that is.

07:28.524 --> 07:31.558
Tina is the name I gave my
bedroom, and I want her back!

07:31.560 --> 07:33.292
There's no need for you
to raise your voice.

07:33.294 --> 07:35.461
Here's the dealio, Brick.

07:35.463 --> 07:38.030
My room at school stinks.
Axl's room stinks.

07:38.032 --> 07:39.965
I <i> need</i> a sanctuary.

07:39.967 --> 07:41.099
When I am a working actress

07:41.101 --> 07:42.601
living half the year in Hollywood

07:42.603 --> 07:43.903
and the other half on Broadway,

07:43.905 --> 07:45.805
then you can have it,
but not until then.

07:45.807 --> 07:48.774
I was maybe gonna let you use it if
I do a semester abroad in Houston,

07:48.776 --> 07:50.575
but now we'll have to see.

07:50.577 --> 07:53.429
- Sue, here's the thing about Santiago.
- Tina.

07:53.454 --> 07:55.580
I didn't expect Santiago
and I to get so close.

07:55.582 --> 07:56.714
Ugh!

07:56.716 --> 07:59.584
I gave you my room
as a Not Mother's Day gift

07:59.586 --> 08:01.519
out of the goodness of my heart,

08:01.521 --> 08:03.621
but now I want it back.

08:03.623 --> 08:05.490
No. I <i> need</i> it back.

08:05.492 --> 08:06.957
And I would hope that as my brother,

08:06.959 --> 08:08.091
you would understand that.

08:10.863 --> 08:12.095
Your words are moving.

08:13.098 --> 08:14.397
But I'm not.

08:15.968 --> 08:17.200
Okay, fine, Brick.

08:17.202 --> 08:20.537
I don't need a sanctuary.
I have a sanctuary in here.

08:20.539 --> 08:22.806
And just so you know,
you are not gonna be visiting me

08:22.808 --> 08:24.974
on Broadway or in Hollywood.

08:24.976 --> 08:26.108
Maybe Houston.

08:26.110 --> 08:27.877
I'd really like the whole family
to see that

08:27.879 --> 08:30.780
because they have a nice harbor area.

08:34.150 --> 08:38.788
So, I'm gonna stop and pick up
some toilet paper at CVS,

08:38.789 --> 08:40.522
unless you're gonna grab some from work.

08:40.524 --> 08:41.823
No, I think they're onto me,

08:41.825 --> 08:43.692
so I'm gonna lay low for a while.

08:43.693 --> 08:45.494
Oh, and I'm still mad at you

08:45.496 --> 08:47.516
about that whole divorce thing
the other day.

08:48.098 --> 08:49.498
Where did that come from?

08:49.500 --> 08:50.832
You said we needed toilet paper,

08:50.834 --> 08:52.266
which reminded me of the bathroom,

08:52.268 --> 08:53.635
which reminded me of my magazine,

08:53.637 --> 08:55.236
which reminded me how mad I am.

08:55.238 --> 08:56.972
What are you mad at me for?
I didn't say anything.

08:56.974 --> 08:59.006
Yeah, exactly. You didn't say anything.

08:59.008 --> 09:02.042
You just sat there quietly
soaking up all our kids' love.

09:02.044 --> 09:04.111
Come on. That was like two days ago.

09:04.113 --> 09:06.580
Yeah, I know, but I couldn't
get mad in front of April.

09:06.582 --> 09:09.082
I don't want her to see
our dirty laundry.

09:09.084 --> 09:11.719
Our actual dirty laundry
was on the counter.

09:11.721 --> 09:15.021
Whatever. I wanted to tell you
how mad I was, but I forgot.

09:15.023 --> 09:16.055
Come on, Frankie.

09:16.057 --> 09:17.724
There's not enough to be mad about now?

09:17.726 --> 09:19.058
You got to go digging in the past?

09:19.060 --> 09:20.994
It was a stupid little argument.

09:22.898 --> 09:25.164
I'm not mad, I'm hurt.

09:25.166 --> 09:27.199
Kind of hard to tell the difference.

09:27.201 --> 09:29.636
Okay, fine. I'm mad.

09:29.638 --> 09:31.103
And I know everybody was kidding

09:31.105 --> 09:32.638
about not wanting to live with me.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.706
- I wasn't.
- Axl, that's mean.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.875
Mom, if it makes you feel
any better, I'd live with you.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.577
No, it doesn't make me feel any better.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.012
I don't want your pity vote.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.713
If I'm not your first choice, forget it.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.448
Conversation over.

09:43.450 --> 09:46.484
Although I'd love to know
what's so great about this guy.

09:46.486 --> 09:48.653
Well, he's not yelling at us
at 9:30 in the morning.

09:48.655 --> 09:50.487
I think what A...

09:50.489 --> 09:54.792
Axl is trying to say is
you can get a little excitable.

09:54.794 --> 09:55.960
What do you mean I get excitable?

09:55.962 --> 09:58.228
I don't get excitable.
Am I excitable now?

09:58.230 --> 09:59.530
How can I put this?

09:59.532 --> 10:01.032
You're a strong cup of coffee.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.200
So, you want to live with him?

10:03.202 --> 10:04.635
He's boring!

10:04.637 --> 10:07.070
I bring vim and verve to this family.

10:07.072 --> 10:10.006
I'm like a three-ring circus
compared to this guy.

10:10.008 --> 10:12.341
He's like watching a Jerry Lewis movie

10:12.343 --> 10:14.277
and skipping through
all the Jerry Lewis parts.

10:14.279 --> 10:15.579
Who? Who? Who?

10:16.582 --> 10:18.414
Forget it. Geez.

10:19.918 --> 10:21.718
Although I want to know why
all of you guys think

10:21.720 --> 10:23.819
it would be so hard to live with me.

10:23.821 --> 10:25.253
I don't know. You honk a lot.

10:25.255 --> 10:27.056
You're always saying, "What's the haps?"

10:27.058 --> 10:28.557
And then there's your clapping.

10:28.559 --> 10:29.725
Oh, yeah. Totally.

10:29.727 --> 10:32.027
My clapping?
What's wrong with my clapping?

10:32.029 --> 10:33.862
It's got this really weird pitch to it,

10:33.864 --> 10:35.130
and it's really... Loud.

10:35.132 --> 10:36.565
Yeah, it's like you hate
your hands. - Mm-hmm.

10:36.567 --> 10:37.766
That's why I didn't want
to watch the finale

10:37.768 --> 10:39.267
of "The Bachelor" with you.

10:39.269 --> 10:40.468
So, I'm just the annoying mom

10:40.470 --> 10:41.903
who claps too loud and is excitable.

10:41.905 --> 10:43.304
Why don't you start making a list

10:43.306 --> 10:44.973
of all the things
you don't like about me?

10:44.975 --> 10:46.373
Don't start a list.

10:46.375 --> 10:49.310
Okay, you guys, maybe we should
all just live with Mom.

10:49.312 --> 10:50.812
I got to stay with Dad.

10:50.814 --> 10:51.980
He's the one who would keep the house

10:51.982 --> 10:53.280
and I'm really starting
to like your room.

10:53.282 --> 10:55.282
Why does Dad get to keep the house?

10:55.284 --> 10:56.883
- Well, he's got all the kids.
- Mm-hmm.

10:56.885 --> 10:58.752
Look, this whole conversation
is pointless

10:58.754 --> 11:00.353
because nobody's getting divorced.

11:00.355 --> 11:01.922
Don't be so sure.

11:01.924 --> 11:03.156
You know why they want to live with you.

11:03.158 --> 11:05.425
'Cause they know nothing about you.

11:05.427 --> 11:07.060
Huh. No, I'm serious.

11:07.062 --> 11:09.896
What do we really know about him? Hmm?

11:09.898 --> 11:13.333
Once a week he eats sardines on
crackers and he likes the Colts.

11:13.335 --> 11:16.235
Don't you see what's happening here?

11:16.237 --> 11:18.203
He's winning because he's silent.

11:18.205 --> 11:19.538
He's a statue.

11:19.540 --> 11:22.307
I'm the one who tells him,
"Go talk to your son.

11:22.309 --> 11:24.076
See how your daughter likes college."

11:24.078 --> 11:25.410
He's a puppet.

11:25.412 --> 11:27.747
I'm just sticking my hand
up there and making him talk.

11:27.749 --> 11:30.549
I'm Wayland Flowers and he's Madame.

11:30.551 --> 11:31.816
- Who?
- Who? Who?

11:31.818 --> 11:33.618
The ventriloquist on
the "Hollywood Squares."

11:33.620 --> 11:35.120
- What's "Hollywood Squares"?
- What's a ventriloquist?

11:35.122 --> 11:38.089
Okay, I'm the one who's
always done everything for you.

11:38.091 --> 11:40.324
I wiped your noses. I wiped your butts.

11:40.326 --> 11:42.560
You know what? Go ahead.

11:42.562 --> 11:44.963
You want to live with your dad,
live with your dad.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.064
But guess what.

11:46.066 --> 11:47.265
He doesn't like to shop,

11:47.267 --> 11:49.399
so all that stuff
you're eating right there,

11:49.401 --> 11:50.901
I'm just gonna take it away.

11:50.903 --> 11:52.836
Yep. That's right.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.638
This is what it's like
living with your dad.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.439
Sardines and silence.

11:56.441 --> 11:59.777
So, that's what you guys want,
well, then you can be...

11:59.779 --> 12:02.345
April. Hey.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.847
Just serving the family breakfast.

12:03.849 --> 12:06.282
Kind of a Monday morning tradition.

12:06.284 --> 12:08.851
Here you go.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.419
Here you go, sweetheart.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.795
<i>So, yeah, you know, moms are abused.</i>

12:18.797 --> 12:21.330
<i>But the best that you can do
is role-model good behavior</i>

12:21.332 --> 12:22.998
<i>and just kill them with kindness.</i>

12:23.000 --> 12:25.500
Hey, Axl. Nice costume.

12:25.502 --> 12:27.769
What are you, an oldtimey army captain?

12:27.771 --> 12:29.805
I'm Prince Charming. God.

12:29.807 --> 12:31.707
<i>Or I could just kill 'em.</i>

12:31.709 --> 12:34.142
So, you and April going
to a party or something?

12:34.144 --> 12:37.145
Well, I wanted to go to a party,
but April thought it'd be fun

12:37.147 --> 12:38.913
to dress up and hand out candy to kids,

12:38.915 --> 12:41.615
so I'm doing that
'cause when you love someone,

12:41.617 --> 12:42.683
you're nice to them.

12:45.955 --> 12:48.055
God. Move, Mom!

12:54.797 --> 12:57.330
Hey, Brick. Going out tonight, huh?

12:57.332 --> 12:59.766
Are you gonna be out, like,
the whole night?

12:59.768 --> 13:02.635
Uh... no.

13:02.637 --> 13:04.003
Actually, I'm not.

13:04.005 --> 13:05.038
Really?

13:05.040 --> 13:06.773
You're not going trick-or-treating?

13:06.775 --> 13:08.174
No, ma'am.

13:08.176 --> 13:10.844
Then why are you dressed
like a bowling pin?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.011
No reason.

13:18.719 --> 13:23.455
Huh. Seems like an odd choice of
wardrobe just for hanging out.

13:23.457 --> 13:26.024
Well, the rest of my clothes
are in the laundry.

13:26.026 --> 13:28.894
That is a very plausible story.

13:29.112 --> 13:30.594
It's why I said it.

13:30.596 --> 13:32.096
Okay, then.

13:32.098 --> 13:34.165
I am going to take out the trash

13:34.167 --> 13:36.400
because everything makes sense here.

14:10.668 --> 14:11.834
Yeah.

14:25.882 --> 14:27.615
Aah!

14:55.977 --> 14:57.844
Open this door!

15:02.984 --> 15:05.051
What the hell is going on in here?

15:05.053 --> 15:05.750
Brick stole Tina.

15:05.775 --> 15:07.353
- He won't give it back...
- She's going back to college anyway.

15:07.355 --> 15:08.654
...and he said the summer's
not over and he's wrong!

15:08.656 --> 15:10.422
Hey! That's it.

15:10.424 --> 15:12.090
Everyone's going back
to their original rooms.

15:12.092 --> 15:14.759
And no more naming things
that shouldn't have names.

15:14.761 --> 15:17.428
The name of this room is room!

15:19.766 --> 15:21.052
Frankie!

15:21.101 --> 15:23.473
You're not gonna believe
what these numbnuts did.

15:23.498 --> 15:24.411
Dad, if you'll just listen to me,

15:24.436 --> 15:25.737
- it is not my fault!
- She knocked me over with a basketball!

15:25.739 --> 15:26.838
I don't want to hear it!

15:26.840 --> 15:28.573
Mom, it is not fair.

15:28.575 --> 15:32.209
I gave Brick my room,
and now I have a broken door

15:32.211 --> 15:33.710
and a hole in the wall!

15:33.712 --> 15:35.045
I'm sorry I did that, Sue,

15:35.047 --> 15:37.214
and maybe I held onto your room
too long.

15:37.216 --> 15:39.649
But you know what?
At least you have a room.

15:39.651 --> 15:41.418
I don't have anything of my own.

15:41.420 --> 15:43.988
No baby pictures,
clothes from the cousin box.

15:43.990 --> 15:46.655
I don't even have a chair
at the dinner table.

15:46.657 --> 15:48.191
None of you have walked in my shoes.

15:48.193 --> 15:49.625
I don't even walk in my shoes!

15:49.627 --> 15:51.995
I walk in Cousin Jared's shoes.

15:53.932 --> 15:55.798
I don't know why you guys
are telling me this.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.901
You should tell the guy
you chose to live with.

15:57.903 --> 15:59.235
What?

15:59.237 --> 16:01.037
I'm just saying,
you're only gonna see me

16:01.039 --> 16:02.571
on weekends and every other Christmas,

16:02.573 --> 16:04.004
so you better get used to it.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.206
Oh, my God.

16:05.208 --> 16:07.842
Is she really still talking
about this hypothetical divorce?

16:07.844 --> 16:09.878
Yes,<i> she</i> is.

16:11.715 --> 16:13.615
I was really hurt.

16:13.617 --> 16:15.183
You know, when your kids are teenagers,

16:15.185 --> 16:16.518
everyone says, "Oh, don't worry.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.253
When they get older,
they will appreciate you

16:18.255 --> 16:20.554
and be thankful for everything
that you do for them."

16:20.556 --> 16:22.756
Well, you are older.

16:22.758 --> 16:24.858
And it just hit me that
that's never gonna happen.

16:24.860 --> 16:26.560
You know, that divorce
might've been hypothetical,

16:26.562 --> 16:29.096
but my feelings are very real,

16:29.098 --> 16:31.532
and if hurting my feelings
was what you were trying to do,

16:31.534 --> 16:34.268
well, congratulations
on a job well done.

16:35.939 --> 16:37.170
Ooh.

16:37.172 --> 16:38.305
Aah.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.974
Are you freaking kidding me?!

16:40.976 --> 16:42.242
You people are gonna sit there

16:42.244 --> 16:44.377
and try to make me feel
crappy about myself?!

16:44.379 --> 16:46.746
- Hi!
- Hey, April!

16:47.782 --> 16:50.338
We're just doing our Halloween thang.

16:51.219 --> 16:53.019
No, you know what? If you're
gonna be hanging around here,

16:53.021 --> 16:55.454
you should hear this, too,
because I am through

16:55.456 --> 16:58.290
being this family's punching bag!

16:58.292 --> 17:00.625
And I am sorry if I have
an annoying clap,

17:00.627 --> 17:01.994
and I am sorry that I like dancing

17:01.996 --> 17:03.329
to the "Law & Order" theme,

17:03.331 --> 17:05.964
or that I'm not good at
fast-forwarding with the remote.

17:05.967 --> 17:08.666
But guess what.
I am done defending myself.

17:08.669 --> 17:10.836
If you're all so perfect,
you can have each other.

17:10.838 --> 17:13.771
Take a last look at
this annoying, clapping mom

17:13.772 --> 17:17.308
that nobody wants to live with,
'cause I am storming out!

17:19.612 --> 17:22.079
Trick or treat!

17:22.082 --> 17:24.115
Ooh, aren't you cute.

17:24.117 --> 17:26.784
Oh, look a pirate.

17:26.786 --> 17:28.718
Shiver me timbers.

17:30.522 --> 17:34.024
Storming out!

17:38.102 --> 17:39.334
<i>As far as storming out goes,</i>

17:39.336 --> 17:41.569
<i>I picked a pretty good night to do it.</i>

17:42.814 --> 17:46.141
<i>I followed a kid with a hole
in his candy sack.</i>

17:47.744 --> 17:50.045
<i>I was able to prevent some wayward teens</i>

17:50.047 --> 17:52.915
<i>from going down the wrong path.</i>

17:54.284 --> 17:57.451
<i>And to cap it all off,
I popped by Nancy Donahue's</i>

17:57.453 --> 17:59.153
<i>Bible-themed haunted house.</i>

17:59.155 --> 18:02.323
Oh, that apple does look good.

18:02.325 --> 18:04.292
But I just don't know.

18:04.852 --> 18:07.161
All ye!

18:07.163 --> 18:09.296
Ignore the temptation.

18:09.298 --> 18:12.699
Come, walk on the water with me.

18:12.701 --> 18:15.368
Frankie, there's caramel apples
and Halloween-themed doughnuts

18:15.370 --> 18:17.770
in the backyard next to the pits
of hellfire pit.

18:17.772 --> 18:19.272
Oh, great.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.687
<i>But all good things must come to an end,</i>

18:25.689 --> 18:30.157
<i>and it was time to go home
to my actual haunted house.</i>

18:30.158 --> 18:32.525
<i>Crap.</i>

18:32.527 --> 18:34.094
Hey, April.

18:34.096 --> 18:35.528
You hitting the road?

18:35.530 --> 18:36.862
No, I'm just going home.

18:36.864 --> 18:39.432
Oh.

18:40.335 --> 18:41.701
Are you okay?

18:42.534 --> 18:44.670
Oh. Yeah.

18:44.671 --> 18:46.572
Just another night at the Heck house.

18:46.574 --> 18:48.273
It's what we do.

18:48.599 --> 18:50.232
Well, I felt really bad for you,

18:50.234 --> 18:52.768
so I told Axl he should be nicer.

18:52.770 --> 18:56.204
I mean, we only have one mom,
and moms are pretty great.

18:56.206 --> 18:57.706
Aww.

18:57.708 --> 18:59.775
Thank you, April.

18:59.777 --> 19:01.543
Don't tell Axl I said that.

19:01.545 --> 19:04.534
I mean, he knows the part
that I told him

19:04.536 --> 19:06.780
because I said it to him,
but he doesn't know

19:06.782 --> 19:09.565
that I'm telling you
about the part that I told him.

19:09.853 --> 19:10.985
Got it.

19:13.050 --> 19:14.348
Okay, I should get going.

19:14.350 --> 19:15.884
Yeah, you better get home by midnight

19:15.886 --> 19:18.152
or your car might turn into a pumpkin.

19:18.154 --> 19:19.519
Oh, my gosh, why?

19:19.521 --> 19:21.755
It's just that you're wearing the...

19:24.293 --> 19:26.459
You know what? It's late.

19:26.461 --> 19:27.695
Good night, April.

19:34.170 --> 19:35.802
Look what the cat dragged in.

19:35.804 --> 19:38.637
Ha, ha.

19:38.639 --> 19:41.074
Just for the record,
I did go out looking for you.

19:41.076 --> 19:43.242
I was following a trail
of Tootsie Roll wrappers,

19:43.244 --> 19:45.444
but I lost you in some high grass.

19:46.835 --> 19:48.701
What am I doing wrong?

19:48.703 --> 19:50.896
That sounds like a morning question.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.505
No, seriously. Why do all
the kids want to go with you?

19:54.675 --> 19:56.474
Frankie, it doesn't matter.
Here's the thing.

19:56.476 --> 19:58.102
I wouldn't take them anyway.

19:59.112 --> 20:01.079
<i>I guess when it comes right down to it,</i>

20:01.081 --> 20:03.148
<i>we're not like celebrities.</i>

20:03.150 --> 20:06.384
<i>We can't leave each other.
We don't have enough options.</i>

20:06.386 --> 20:11.656
<i>Besides, it's so much easier to
split up $50 million than $50.</i>

20:11.658 --> 20:14.491
<i>And then, of course,
there's the whole love thing.</i>

20:18.902 --> 20:19.967
All right. Right this way.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.611
Then you're gonna take a sharp right.

20:23.625 --> 20:25.514
And a sharp left.

20:26.528 --> 20:28.328
Couple more paces.

20:28.330 --> 20:30.363
All right, so we've all been talking,

20:30.365 --> 20:33.165
and we decided you deserved this.

20:35.169 --> 20:37.002
My own chair?

20:37.004 --> 20:38.904
And it's just like everyone else's!

20:38.906 --> 20:40.406
Welcome to the family!

20:40.408 --> 20:42.541
I've been waiting 14 years to hear that.

20:44.045 --> 20:45.644
How'd you get the exact same one?

20:45.646 --> 20:46.878
I was looking for the receipt

20:46.880 --> 20:48.479
to see where we bought the other chairs,

20:48.481 --> 20:50.681
and I found that one under
a pile of crap in the basement.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.350
Oh. Aww, see?

20:52.352 --> 20:53.918
This is why we stay together.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.753
Hey, I would never leave you.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.655
What do you mean you wouldn't leave me?

20:57.657 --> 20:59.958
If anybody's doing anything
leaving, I'm leaving you.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.560
I don't know. I don't really see
Mom leaving Dad.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.762
Hey, if the woman wants
to leave me, let her leave me.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.496
Okay, see, that's not nice.

21:06.498 --> 21:09.232
I bet Mom would probably never
say something like that.

21:09.234 --> 21:10.834
I think we should reconsider
moving in with Mom.

21:10.836 --> 21:12.869
No, we all have to stay together.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.071
I have a chair.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.305
- Aww.
- That's a good point.

21:15.307 --> 21:16.906
Mm-hmm.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.442
Thank you, guys.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.410
That looks good.

21:22.646 --> 21:24.613
Say "chair".
